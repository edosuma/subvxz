WEBVTT

00:00.377 --> 00:02.909
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:02.909 --> 00:04.111
FRANK PERKINS.

00:04.111 --> 00:05.812
LOU'S PARTNER?
IS HE HERE?

00:05.812 --> 00:08.248
NO. HE'S IN HONG KONG
ON BUSINESS.

00:08.248 --> 00:09.983
THATCHER KARSTEN THOUGHT YOUR
HUSBAND WAS STEALING FROM HIM.

00:09.983 --> 00:12.853
THAT'S WHY KARSTEN SENT T.J.
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

00:12.853 --> 00:15.655
IF ANYONE ASKS,
YOU WERE WITH BRANDY.

00:15.655 --> 00:17.924
T.J. KARSTEN,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

00:17.924 --> 00:20.594
WHAT HAPPENED WAS A MISTAKE,
AND I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

00:20.594 --> 00:23.130
IT ISN'T LIKE THAT.
WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS IS.

00:23.130 --> 00:24.965
MEET ME TONIGHT,
8:00, HERE.

00:24.965 --> 00:28.368
IF YOU DON'T COME,
I WILL NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

01:43.443 --> 01:46.446
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:21.448 --> 02:23.049
GOD, I HATE THIS.

02:23.049 --> 02:25.352
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW CAN THEY HOLD T.J.

02:25.352 --> 02:26.653
WITH SO LITTLE EVIDENCE.

02:26.653 --> 02:29.589
SINCE WHEN HAS THE LEGAL PROCESS
EVER BEEN ABOUT FAIRNESS?

02:29.589 --> 02:31.491
SINCE WHEN
DID YOU GET SO CYNICAL?

02:31.491 --> 02:33.159
I THINK
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

02:33.159 --> 02:34.928
I EVER WALKED
INTO A COURTROOM.

02:34.928 --> 02:37.464
YEAH, IT DOESN'T HELP
THAT AUNT CONNIE TOLD THEM

02:37.464 --> 02:40.066
THAT SHE SAW T.J. AND LOU
ARGUE THAT NIGHT.

02:40.066 --> 02:42.168
WELL,
WHAT ELSE COULD SHE DO?

02:42.168 --> 02:43.904
ANYWAY,
HE'S INNOCENT.

02:43.904 --> 02:45.839
YEAH,
HE'S ALSO A KARSTEN.

02:47.007 --> 02:49.042
SO T.J.'s BEING USED
AS A SCAPEGOAT

02:49.042 --> 02:50.277
FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE

02:50.277 --> 02:52.746
THAT MY FATHER HAS PISSED OFF
OVER THE YEARS?

02:52.746 --> 02:54.548
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY
FROM THIS SCREWED-UP FAMILY

02:54.548 --> 02:55.549
WHEN WE HAD A CHANCE.

02:55.549 --> 02:58.385
WHEN WAS THAT,
EXACTLY?

02:58.385 --> 02:59.553
CAN YOU ZIP ME?

02:59.553 --> 03:01.521
WE COULD STILL DO IT,
YOU KNOW.

03:01.521 --> 03:03.523
ESCAPE,
SHOW THE KIDS THE WORLD.

03:03.523 --> 03:04.758
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

03:04.758 --> 03:05.959
WE COULD DRIVE UP
THE AMALFI COAST.

03:05.959 --> 03:07.460
THAT WOULD REALLY GIVE THEM
SOME PERSPECTIVE.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.363
WE HAVE A BAIL HEARING
IN AN HOUR.

03:13.767 --> 03:17.304
THAT SLEAZE McALLISTER
HAS A HOOKER AS AN ALIBI.

03:17.304 --> 03:18.838
I HAVE
A WIDOW'S SWORN STATEMENT

03:18.838 --> 03:20.473
PLACING T.J. KARSTEN
AT THE SCENE.

03:20.473 --> 03:21.708
WHAT'S A HOOKER?

03:21.708 --> 03:23.543
NOTHING, HONEY.
EAT YOUR CEREAL.

03:23.543 --> 03:24.844
WHAT'S A SLEAZE?

03:24.844 --> 03:27.714
A SLEAZE IS SOMEBODY
WHO DOESN'T PLAY BY THE RULES.

03:27.714 --> 03:28.748
LIKE A CHEATER?

03:28.748 --> 03:30.483
EXACTLY.
WHY DO THEY CHEAT?

03:30.483 --> 03:32.319
OLIVER,
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

03:32.319 --> 03:33.553
HONEY, NO,
LOOK, THERE'S --

03:33.553 --> 03:35.322
THERE'S CERTAIN HARSH TRUTHS
IN THIS WORLD

03:35.322 --> 03:36.590
THAT YOU
JUST CAN'T AVOID,

03:36.590 --> 03:38.024
YOU CAN'T SWEEP
UNDER THE RUG.

03:38.024 --> 03:40.694
HE'S TOO SMART FOR IT.

03:40.694 --> 03:42.395
SLEAZES CHEAT
BECAUSE THEY THINK

03:42.395 --> 03:43.630
THEY'RE BETTER
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE,

03:43.630 --> 03:47.100
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO TELL THEM THEY AREN'T.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.735
SO SLEAZES
ARE BAD GUYS.

03:48.735 --> 03:50.437
RIGHT.

03:50.437 --> 03:52.839
BUT I NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY
DON'T GET AWAY WITH BEING BAD.

03:52.839 --> 03:53.840
SO YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.776
LIKE I SAID,
THE KID'S A GENIUS.

03:56.776 --> 03:58.945
GO GET YOUR STUFF,
BABY.

03:58.945 --> 04:00.614
OKAY.

04:00.614 --> 04:03.583
MY CLIENT IS A YOUNG MAN
WITH ROOTS IN THIS COMMUNITY.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.318
AND THE MEANS TO FLEE,
YOUR HONOR.

04:05.318 --> 04:07.354
FURTHERMORE,
THE STATE HAS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE

04:07.354 --> 04:08.622
LINKING HIM TO THIS CRIME.

04:08.622 --> 04:09.756
WE HAVE THE MOTIVE
OF RETRIBUTION

04:09.756 --> 04:12.459
OVER THE MISSING MONEY
AND THE WIDOW'S STATEMENT.

04:12.459 --> 04:13.727
WHICH STATEMENT?

04:13.727 --> 04:14.828
THE FIRST OR THE SECOND ONE
YOU PRESSURED HER INTO?

04:14.828 --> 04:17.130
SHE PLACES HIM
AS THE LAST KNOWN PERSON

04:17.130 --> 04:18.498
TO SEE THE VICTIM ALIVE.

04:18.498 --> 04:21.668
THERE'S NO GUN, YOUR HONOR,
AND HE HAS A STRONG ALIBI.

04:21.668 --> 04:22.836
HIS GIRLFRIEND,
BRANDY KORSKAYA,

04:22.836 --> 04:24.437
WILL TESTIFY THAT
AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER --

04:24.437 --> 04:26.106
A GIRLFRIEND? IS THAT
WHAT WE'RE CALLING HER NOW?

04:26.106 --> 04:28.608
PUT AWAY THE SWORDS,
BOYS.

04:28.608 --> 04:30.543
CONSIDERING THE SERIOUSNESS
OF THE CRIME

04:30.543 --> 04:32.278
AND THE DEFENDANT'S RISK
OF FLIGHT,

04:32.278 --> 04:34.047
I FIND FOR THE STATE.

04:34.047 --> 04:35.582
BAIL DENIED.
YOUR HONOR --

04:35.582 --> 04:38.385
COUNSELOR, YOU'RE FREE TO
PETITION FOR ANOTHER HEARING.

04:48.161 --> 04:49.396
WE'LL GET YOU OUT,
SON.

04:49.396 --> 04:50.997
YOU BE STRONG.

04:50.997 --> 04:52.832
LIKE YOU WERE,
RIGHT, DAD?

04:52.832 --> 04:55.335
WHEN YOU WENT AWAY
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

04:55.335 --> 04:58.004
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:58.004 --> 05:00.507
JUST LIKE THAT.

05:02.842 --> 05:05.412
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
"TEEJ," OKAY?

05:10.784 --> 05:13.420
HE SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
WITH REGULAR CRIMINALS.

05:13.420 --> 05:15.822
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE
WAS A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.

05:15.822 --> 05:17.357
WOULD THAT
HAVE BEEN BETTER?

05:17.357 --> 05:19.959
AT SOME POINT, YOU ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

05:19.959 --> 05:21.061
THAT HE'S DIFFERENT.

05:21.061 --> 05:22.328
HE HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS.

05:22.328 --> 05:24.931
WHAT HE NEEDS IS FOR US
TO GET THE COPS OFF HIS BACK

05:24.931 --> 05:25.932
AND BRING HIM HOME.

05:25.932 --> 05:28.234
JACK.

05:28.234 --> 05:29.335
I JUST GOT AN E-MAIL

05:29.335 --> 05:31.371
SAYING PERKINS IS BACK
FROM HONG KONG.

05:31.371 --> 05:32.372
WHO'S PERKINS?

05:32.372 --> 05:34.074
LOU'S PARTNER
ON THE LOFTS PROJECT.

05:34.074 --> 05:36.776
WE THINK HE STOLE SOME MONEY,
LOU FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.

05:36.776 --> 05:39.212
PERKINS MAY HAVE KILLED LOU
TO KEEP IT QUIET.

05:39.212 --> 05:41.448
SO, AS LONG THIS GUY PERKINS
IS OUT THERE,

05:41.448 --> 05:43.249
T.J. IS GONNA BE STUCK
IN JAIL.

05:43.249 --> 05:44.317
YOU FIND HIM.

05:44.317 --> 05:46.152
GIVE THESE BASTARDS
A BETTER THEORY

05:46.152 --> 05:47.721
THAN THE ONE
THEY'VE GOT.

05:53.460 --> 05:55.562
I ONLY SOLD THREE?

05:55.562 --> 05:58.264
AND TWO
WERE TO THE SAME GUY

05:58.264 --> 06:00.300
WHO SPENT THREE HOURS
IN THE BACK ROOM DECIDING.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.770
TURNS OUT MOST OF OUR CLIENTS
AREN'T SO INTO STAGED REALISM.

06:03.770 --> 06:06.606
OKAY, WELL, I HAVE A NEW IDEA
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT.

06:06.606 --> 06:08.708
IT'S A SERIES
ON OBSESSION.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.877
I'M --
I'M TRYING TO CAPTURE

06:10.877 --> 06:14.614
HOW THINGS CAN TAKE OVER
YOUR THOUGHTS AND CONSUME YOU.

06:14.614 --> 06:16.449
SARA, YOUR PORTRAITS
ARE STUNNING.

06:16.449 --> 06:18.485
BUT YOUR WORK
IS TOO COMMERCIAL FOR US,

06:18.485 --> 06:20.186
TOO CONTROLLED,
TOO<i> VANITY FAIR.</i>

06:20.186 --> 06:21.988
YEAH, BUT THIS NEW
OBSESSION STORY,

06:21.988 --> 06:23.323
IT'S A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

06:23.323 --> 06:24.390
IT'S MORE CONCEPTUAL.

06:24.390 --> 06:25.792
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SHOW ME,

06:25.792 --> 06:26.993
I'M HAPPY
TO TAKE A LOOK.

06:26.993 --> 06:28.795
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
MY TWO CENTS -- DON'T FORCE IT.

06:28.795 --> 06:29.963
YOU'RE GOOD WITH GLOSSY.

06:29.963 --> 06:31.865
YOU COULD BE
THE NEXT ANNIE LEIBOVITZ.

06:31.865 --> 06:33.299
RUN WITH THAT.

06:37.437 --> 06:38.671
YEAH,
MR. PERKINS,

06:38.671 --> 06:40.774
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU GETTING BACK TO ME.

06:40.774 --> 06:42.275
IT'S URGENT.

06:57.657 --> 06:59.492
NUMBERS CAME IN
ON THE RIVER PROJECT.

06:59.492 --> 07:00.527
OH, THANKS, FRED.

07:00.527 --> 07:01.661
BREAK THEM DOWN FOR ME,
WILL YOU?

07:01.661 --> 07:03.196
HEY, JACK,
A COUPLE OF THINGS --

07:03.196 --> 07:04.564
YOUR 3:00 GOT PUSHED
TO 4:00

07:04.564 --> 07:07.167
AND OSHA IS DROPPING ALL CHARGES
AGAINST THE PARK DEVELOPMENT.

07:07.167 --> 07:08.668
I HOPE
THEY BUY US FLOWERS, TOO.

07:08.668 --> 07:11.070
THAT'LL PROBABLY DEPEND ON
WHETHER YOU WERE CHARMING JACK

07:11.070 --> 07:12.572
OR BALL-BUSTER JACK.

07:12.572 --> 07:14.507
CAN'T I BE BOTH?
NOT AT THE SAME TIME.

07:14.507 --> 07:16.476
HEY, MR. McALLISTER,
DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

07:16.476 --> 07:17.977
I'M JULES WHITMAN
FROM I.T.

07:17.977 --> 07:19.179
IT'S THAT CLOSET
FULL OF NERDS

07:19.179 --> 07:20.513
OVER THERE
BY THE SERVICE ELEVATOR.

07:20.513 --> 07:21.514
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

07:21.514 --> 07:23.883
20...IN APRIL.

07:23.883 --> 07:25.151
CHECK IT OUT.

07:25.151 --> 07:26.853
I WAS LOOKING INTO REORGANIZING
OUR CORPORATE DATABASE,

07:26.853 --> 07:28.555
AND THERE'S A MAJOR ISSUE.
OH, JACK, I FORGOT --

07:28.555 --> 07:29.989
SOMEONE WAITING
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

07:29.989 --> 07:30.990
BEEN HERE A WHILE.

07:30.990 --> 07:32.325
I'M A TECHNOPHOBE,
ACTUALLY.

07:32.325 --> 07:34.460
IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER ISSUE,
YOU TAKE IT UP WITH --

07:34.460 --> 07:35.562
SIR,
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

07:35.562 --> 07:38.431
I CAN'T TALK NOW.
SOMEBODY'S WAITING.

07:38.431 --> 07:41.100
JACK.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.402
SORRY ABOUT
THE SHORT NOTICE.

07:42.402 --> 07:44.103
I JUST GOT IN
FROM HONG KONG.

07:44.103 --> 07:46.172
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

07:46.172 --> 07:47.173
AND YOU ARE?

07:47.173 --> 07:49.008
OH, GOD,
WHAT A DUMMY.

07:49.008 --> 07:51.578
MY NAME'S PERKINS --
FRANK PERKINS.

07:53.146 --> 07:54.647
I HEAR
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME.

08:48.416 --> 08:49.550
■

08:49.550 --> 08:51.645
SO, WERE YOU
AND UNCLE LOU CLOSE?

08:51.645 --> 08:54.381
NO, NOT REALLY.
YOU KNOW, I'M A MONEY GUY.

08:54.381 --> 08:57.952
I WENT IN AS A SILENT PARTNER
ON THE LOFTS PROJECT

08:57.952 --> 09:00.021
LOU WAS MANAGING
FOR YOU GUYS.

09:00.021 --> 09:02.431
I MET HIM SIX MONTHS AGO
TO HAMMER OUT A DEAL.

09:02.431 --> 09:04.650
DEALT WITH HIM VIA PHONE
MOSTLY SINCE THEN.

09:04.650 --> 09:07.220
I'VE GOT A BOOKKEEPING ISSUE
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT?

09:08.287 --> 09:10.323
I'M HOPING YOU CAN HELP
CLEAR THINGS UP.

09:10.323 --> 09:12.558
SURE.
ANYTHING I CAN DO.

09:12.558 --> 09:16.462
A MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED
FOR THE LOFTS PROJECT VANISHED.

09:16.462 --> 09:18.931
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS

09:18.931 --> 09:21.434
BY COMPARING LOU'S RECORDS
WITH YOURS.

09:21.434 --> 09:22.869
ABSOLUTELY.
LOOK, NO PROBLEM.

09:22.869 --> 09:25.004
I'LL HAVE MY GUYS
SEND THE FINANCIALS RIGHT OVER.

09:26.606 --> 09:28.141
OH,
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

09:30.643 --> 09:33.246
THIS WAS TAKEN ON THE DAY
WE BROKE GROUND ON THE LOFTS.

09:33.246 --> 09:36.416
I GUESS YOU KNEW LOU
WAS A BIG BULLS FAN.

09:36.416 --> 09:38.351
WELL, HE ENDED
EVERY PHONE CALL SAYING,

09:38.351 --> 09:40.153
"JUST WAIT TILL ROSE
COMES AROUND."

09:41.320 --> 09:42.321
THANKS.

09:42.321 --> 09:44.190
THATCHER
WILL APPRECIATE IT.

09:44.190 --> 09:47.827
LEAST I CAN DO.

09:47.827 --> 09:49.695
IT'S A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY,
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:49.695 --> 09:51.264
YEAH, IT IS.

09:52.799 --> 09:55.701
ANY IDEA WHY SOMEONE
WOULD WANT LOU DEAD?

09:55.701 --> 09:58.371
NO, NOT AT ALL.

09:58.371 --> 10:00.773
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE WAY STREET CRIME IS,

10:00.773 --> 10:03.276
IT COULD'VE JUST BEEN
A MUGGING GONE BAD.

10:03.276 --> 10:05.511
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME,
MR. PERKINS.

10:05.511 --> 10:07.280
PLEASE --
"FRANK" IS FINE.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.382
AND IF YOU THINK
OF ANY OTHER WAY

10:09.382 --> 10:11.717
I CAN BE HELPFUL,
LET ME KNOW.

10:23.262 --> 10:25.231
LOU WOULDN'T PAY
A CONTRACTOR.

10:25.231 --> 10:27.333
WANTED TO MANAGE IT
ALL HIMSELF.

10:27.333 --> 10:31.537
I'LL HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE
TO FINISH THE WORK, I GUESS.

10:31.537 --> 10:34.574
I DON'T THINK T.J.
DID IT.

10:34.574 --> 10:36.142
HE LOVED LOU.

10:36.142 --> 10:38.845
BUT I COULDN'T KEEP LYING,

10:38.845 --> 10:40.413
EVEN THOUGH I PROMISED JACK
AND YOUR FATHER.

10:40.413 --> 10:42.849
THEY ASKED YOU
TO LIE TO THE COPS?

10:42.849 --> 10:45.251
THEY WERE JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR T.J.

10:45.251 --> 10:47.420
THEY THOUGHT
LOU WAS STEALING.

10:47.420 --> 10:48.721
HE GOT SCARED.

10:48.721 --> 10:51.958
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
HE AGREED TO WORK WITH THE FEDS.

10:51.958 --> 10:54.026
AND AFTER THATCHER
TALKED TO HIM,

10:54.026 --> 10:56.629
HE PROMISED HE WOULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

10:56.629 --> 10:57.730
A FEW HOURS LATER...

10:57.730 --> 10:59.232
OH, CONNIE,
THAT'S CRAZY.

10:59.232 --> 11:00.967
DAD WOULDN'T DO THIS.
THEN WHO?

11:00.967 --> 11:02.034
I'LL TAKE THIS.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.970
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ABOUT THAT PERKINS GUY?

11:03.970 --> 11:05.972
MAYBE HE'S INVOLVED.
PERKINS?

11:05.972 --> 11:07.940
NO,
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

11:07.940 --> 11:10.176
LOU LIKED HIM.

11:10.176 --> 11:13.079
GOD, I FEEL LIKE A BIRD
IN A CAGE.

11:13.079 --> 11:15.381
THAT'S CHARLIE.

11:15.381 --> 11:16.549
HE WORKS DAYS.

11:16.549 --> 11:19.585
IS ALL THIS PROTECTION
REALLY NECESSARY?

11:19.585 --> 11:23.155
THE PROSECUTOR
THOUGHT I NEEDED IT.

11:23.155 --> 11:26.158
LAINIE,
I-I WANT TO GO.

11:26.158 --> 11:28.628
JUST...GO.

11:28.628 --> 11:30.263
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE?

11:30.263 --> 11:32.431
ESCAPE.
SEE THE WORLD.

11:32.431 --> 11:33.900
I-I...

11:33.900 --> 11:36.068
I CAN'T SPEND MY LIFE AFRAID.

11:36.068 --> 11:39.005
CONNIE, NO ONE IS TRYING
TO HURT YOU.

11:39.005 --> 11:41.574
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

11:41.574 --> 11:44.110
MY FATHER IS CAPABLE
OF A LOT OF THINGS,

11:44.110 --> 11:46.445
BUT NOTHING LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

11:46.445 --> 11:48.681
HE THREATENED ME, TOO,
LAINIE.

11:48.681 --> 11:51.017
AT LOU'S MEMORIAL.
CONNIE --

11:51.017 --> 11:53.452
I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO HEAR.

11:53.452 --> 11:59.792
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE
OF THINGS WE NEVER IMAGINE.

12:36.963 --> 12:39.699
SORRY.

12:39.699 --> 12:42.802
HOTSHOT ARGENTINEAN PIANIST
IS DOING A SERIES OF CONCERTS

12:42.802 --> 12:43.803
AT THE CONSERVATORY.

12:43.803 --> 12:45.137
WE'RE RUNNING
A FEATURE.

12:45.137 --> 12:48.307
YOU ARE GOING TO PHOTOGRAPH
HIS REHEARSAL TODAY.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.843
DO YOU THINK
WAGNER COULD DO IT?

12:50.843 --> 12:52.278
WAGNER
IS SHOOTING MILKSHAKES.

12:52.278 --> 12:53.346
IT'S JUST
I WAS HOPING

12:53.346 --> 12:55.047
TO SPEND THE DAY
ON MY OBSESSION SERIES.

12:55.047 --> 12:56.248
COOL. WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH THE MUSICIAN,

12:56.248 --> 12:57.450
YOU CAN OBSESS
ALL YOU LIKE.

12:57.450 --> 13:00.553
WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC.

13:00.553 --> 13:02.555
SO?

13:02.555 --> 13:04.790
SO I'M THINKING IT MIGHT NOT BE
A GREAT FIT FOR ME.

13:04.790 --> 13:06.192
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:06.192 --> 13:07.727
THIS IS TOTALLY
UP YOUR ALLEY.

13:07.727 --> 13:09.662
IT'S -- IT'S PERSONALITIES
AND PORTRAITS.

13:09.662 --> 13:10.830
IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

13:10.830 --> 13:11.931
EXACTLY.

13:11.931 --> 13:14.433
I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE
I SHOULD JUST GET AWAY

13:14.433 --> 13:16.335
FROM PORTRAITS
FOR A WHILE.

13:16.335 --> 13:20.006
SARA, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU TODAY?

13:22.174 --> 13:24.410
NATALIA STARK
FROM THE GALLERY

13:24.410 --> 13:26.045
SAID MY STUFF
IS TOO COMMERCIAL.

13:26.045 --> 13:29.048
NATALIA STARK
IS A SNOB.

13:29.048 --> 13:30.650
SHE ONLY SOLD
THREE OF MY PRINTS.

13:30.650 --> 13:33.419
WELL, SO YOU HAVE TO BE EDGY
AND EXPERIMENTAL

13:33.419 --> 13:34.453
AND SELL STUFF?

13:34.453 --> 13:36.222
DID I MENTION
I HATE ART?

13:37.256 --> 13:38.891
LOOK,
I ADORE YOU,

13:38.891 --> 13:40.526
BUT IF YOU ARE BECOMING
SOMEHOW DISILLUSIONED

13:40.526 --> 13:41.861
WITH THE WORK
THAT WE'RE DOING HERE,

13:41.861 --> 13:43.462
THEN WE NEED TO HAVE
A BIGGER CONVERSATION.

13:45.498 --> 13:48.901
AURELIO VOLTAN --
HE'S GOT A GOOD FACE.

13:50.403 --> 13:51.637
AND SHE'S BACK.

13:51.637 --> 13:52.738
HALLELUJAH.

13:52.738 --> 13:54.407
THEY'RE EXPECTING YOU
IN AN HOUR.

14:00.579 --> 14:01.947
GET OFF ME!

14:02.982 --> 14:04.216
STOP IT!

14:08.788 --> 14:10.089
HEY!

14:10.089 --> 14:11.424
COME ON!

14:11.424 --> 14:13.059
THAT'S IT --
TO THE OFFICE!

14:13.059 --> 14:15.061
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
FIGHT HIM, VIC?

14:15.061 --> 14:18.030
YOU WANT ME TO LET SOME JERK
SAY STUFF ABOUT OUR FAMILY?

14:21.667 --> 14:23.736
I'M SORRY, BUT THIS IS NOW
AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.

14:23.736 --> 14:25.404
KARSTEN ALLIED
HAS A SECURITY BREACH.

14:25.404 --> 14:27.707
A BIG, FAT WORM IS WORKING
ITS WAY THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM.

14:27.707 --> 14:29.408
IT'S WHAT WE CALL
A BLENDED THREAT --

14:29.408 --> 14:32.411
A WORM/VIRUS/TROJAN HORSE
WITH A TIME-TO-LIVE FIELD

14:32.411 --> 14:34.346
THAT'S GETTING SHORTER
BY THE MINUTE.
SPEAK ENGLISH, PLEASE.

14:34.346 --> 14:35.915
I SEARCHED
OUR SYSTEM ALGORITHMS,

14:35.915 --> 14:37.917
AND WE ARE NOW T-MINUS 12
FROM TOTAL TAKEOVER.

14:37.917 --> 14:38.984
GUESS WHAT HAPPENS THEN.

14:38.984 --> 14:40.052
THE COMPUTERS SHUT DOWN?

14:40.052 --> 14:41.220
AND THE WATER
AND THE ELECTRICITY

14:41.220 --> 14:42.388
AND PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING ELSE.

14:42.388 --> 14:43.989
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
"THE WALKING DEAD" IN HERE.

14:43.989 --> 14:45.324
WHAT CAN YOU DO
TO FIX IT?

14:45.324 --> 14:47.393
I NEED YOUR AUTHORIZATION
TO MODIFY THE A.C.L.

14:47.393 --> 14:48.694
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

14:48.694 --> 14:50.496
JUST -- YOU HAVE
MY AUTHORIZATION. JUST FIX IT.

14:50.496 --> 14:51.831
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA RUN WITH THAT.

14:52.932 --> 14:54.233
HEY.
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

14:54.233 --> 14:55.968
YOU TELL YOUR FATHER
WHAT HAPPENED.

14:55.968 --> 14:57.303
I NEED
TO TALK TO MY DAD.

14:57.303 --> 14:59.505
VIC,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:59.505 --> 15:00.673
THERE WAS A FIGHT,

15:00.673 --> 15:02.808
BUT IN HIS DEFENSE,
THE KID WAS TALKING CRAP.

15:02.808 --> 15:04.243
ABOUT WHAT?

15:04.243 --> 15:06.812
ABOUT UNCLE T.J.,
ABOUT US, AND OUR FAMILY.

15:06.812 --> 15:09.348
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS HERE.

15:10.382 --> 15:12.218
DAD, HE'S, LIKE,
TOTALLY LOSING IT.

15:12.218 --> 15:13.786
LOOK,
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

15:13.786 --> 15:16.155
WE JUST HAVE
A BIT OF A SITUATION HERE.

15:16.155 --> 15:17.323
OKAY.

15:17.323 --> 15:18.724
HEY.

15:18.724 --> 15:21.927
HEY.

15:21.927 --> 15:25.231
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
AVERTING A CRISIS?

15:25.231 --> 15:27.967
I DID NOT
THREATEN HER -- EVER!

15:27.967 --> 15:29.435
THEN WHY
IS SHE SO SCARED?

15:29.435 --> 15:31.504
HOW THE HELL
SHOULD I KNOW?

15:31.504 --> 15:32.972
BECAUSE SHE'S SENILE.

15:32.972 --> 15:34.406
HER MEMORY'S FADING.

15:34.406 --> 15:36.408
SHE NEVER COULD KEEP
ANYTHING STRAIGHT ANYWAY.

15:36.408 --> 15:38.144
DAD, COME ON.
CONNIE'S FINE.

15:38.144 --> 15:39.178
YEAH?

15:39.178 --> 15:41.147
THEN WHY DID SHE
CHANGE HER STORY?

15:41.147 --> 15:43.415
AND WHY IS SHE FEEDING YOU
ALL THIS CRAP

15:43.415 --> 15:45.151
ABOUT US
FORCING HER TO LIE?

15:45.151 --> 15:47.186
GUYS, I CAN HEAR YOU
DOWN THE HALL.

15:47.186 --> 15:48.821
CONNIE'S DOING A NUMBER
ON ELAINE.

15:48.821 --> 15:49.855
WELL, SHE'S TERRIFIED.

15:49.855 --> 15:51.624
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S HOLED UP IN HER HOUSE.

15:51.624 --> 15:52.958
SHE'S GOT POLICE
GUARDING HER.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.160
WELL, DID SHE
TELL YOU WHY?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.195
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T DO
WHAT YOU ASKED HER TO,

15:56.195 --> 15:58.531
BECAUSE SHE THINKS DAD
IS INVOLVED IN LOU'S MURDER.

15:58.531 --> 16:01.100
NOW SHE'S NOT PLAYING ALONG,
HE'S GONNA GO AFTER HER, TOO.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.836
THAT'S ABSURD.
JUST LISTEN TO YOURSELF!

16:03.836 --> 16:07.006
LOOK, WE ONLY ASKED CONNIE
TO BE SELECTIVE.

16:07.006 --> 16:12.111
JACK...WHEN DID YOU BECOME
THAT GUY?

16:12.111 --> 16:14.113
PRESSURING PEOPLE --
MY OWN AUNT --

16:14.113 --> 16:15.614
INTO LYING
TO THE POLICE?

16:15.614 --> 16:19.018
WHEN I STARTED TRYING
TO GET YOUR BROTHER OUT OF JAIL.

16:22.154 --> 16:24.190
WOW.

16:24.190 --> 16:27.860
WOW, DAD.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.196
YOU REALLY DO KNOW
HOW TO TURN PEOPLE

16:30.196 --> 16:33.265
INTO EXACTLY WHAT
YOU NEED THEM TO BE, DON'T YOU?

16:33.265 --> 16:36.869
OH, DO I KNOW
THAT LOOK.

16:36.869 --> 16:40.706
SO CRITICAL.
SO ABSOLUTE.

16:40.706 --> 16:44.443
EVERYTHING'S BLACK AND WHITE,
ISN'T IT?

16:44.443 --> 16:47.246
NO SHADES OF GRAY
FOR YOU.

16:47.246 --> 16:49.114
PEOPLE ARE EITHER GOOD
OR THEY'RE ROTTEN.

16:49.114 --> 16:51.317
YOU LOVE OR YOU HATE.

16:52.518 --> 16:55.254
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN OUR RELATIONSHIP SWITCHED

16:55.254 --> 17:01.026
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER, LAINIE,
BUT...I MISS IT.

17:01.026 --> 17:04.830
I MISS BEING THE FATHER
WHO LOVES YOU.

17:06.232 --> 17:09.435
I'M SURPRISED
YOU REMEMBER THAT...

17:09.435 --> 17:12.171
BECAUSE I SURE DON'T.

17:24.965 --> 17:26.677
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA PREVENT THIS.

17:26.677 --> 17:28.145
WELL, IF YOU'D LISTENED TO ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE --

17:28.145 --> 17:30.004
DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:30.004 --> 17:32.740
UH, SLIGHT POWER OUTAGE --
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

17:32.740 --> 17:33.974
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BOSS.
I'M ALL OVER IT.

17:33.974 --> 17:35.909
DON'T CALL ME "BOSS."
YOU GOT IT, CHIEF.

17:35.909 --> 17:38.212
OR THAT, EITHER.

17:39.747 --> 17:41.482
SO, HE'S YOUR DAD,
HUH?

17:41.482 --> 17:42.616
YEAH.

17:42.616 --> 17:43.951
NICE GUY.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.988
THESE THINGS
CAN BE PRETTY PESKY.

17:47.988 --> 17:50.024
YOU EVER HEAR
OF THE MORRIS WORM?

17:50.024 --> 17:51.358
CODE RED?
MAFIABOY?

17:51.358 --> 17:53.427
NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:53.427 --> 17:54.428
ILOVEYOU?

17:54.428 --> 17:55.996
WHAT?

17:55.996 --> 17:58.271
ILOVEYOU --
IT WAS THIS WORM

17:58.271 --> 17:59.883
THAT SPREAD THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE WORLD IN A DAY,

17:59.883 --> 18:01.133
DISGUISED
AS A LOVE LETTER.

18:01.133 --> 18:03.536
PROVING LOVE
REALLY DOES SUCK, I GUESS.

18:03.536 --> 18:05.171
YEAH.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.573
SO DO WORMS.

18:07.573 --> 18:09.709
LET'S GO ON A MISSION
TO MAKE THEM BOTH OBSOLETE.

18:14.046 --> 18:16.048
MY FOOTWORK STUNK,

18:16.048 --> 18:17.450
BUT I HAD
A HELL OF A RIGHT HAND

18:17.450 --> 18:20.086
AND I COULD ALWAYS
TAKE A PUNCH.

18:20.086 --> 18:22.221
THEY USED TO CALL BOXING
THE MANLY ART.

18:22.221 --> 18:23.789
YOU KNOW WHY?

18:23.789 --> 18:29.262
BECAUSE IT FORCES YOU TO DEAL
WITH YOUR FEAR<i> AND</i> YOUR RAGE,

18:29.262 --> 18:33.032
NOT JUST PHYSICALLY,
BUT ALSO UP HERE.

18:33.032 --> 18:36.302
YOU NEED
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,

18:36.302 --> 18:38.838
"WHAT'S THE BALANCE
BETWEEN SELF-DEFENSE

18:38.838 --> 18:39.939
AND NAKED AGGRESSION?"

18:39.939 --> 18:41.107
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT

18:41.107 --> 18:43.342
HITTING THE OTHER GUY
HARDER THAN HE HITS YOU.

18:43.342 --> 18:44.543
NO.

18:44.543 --> 18:47.280
IF YOU WANT TO BE POWERFUL --
REALLY POWERFUL --

18:47.280 --> 18:49.548
YOU NEED TO DEVELOP
SELF-RESTRAINT.

18:49.548 --> 18:54.720
POWER WITHOUT SELF-CONTROL
COUNTS FOR NOTHING.

18:57.490 --> 18:59.592
VIC,
WE HAVE TO FINISH OUR TALK.

18:59.592 --> 19:01.460
I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

19:01.460 --> 19:04.163
YOU CAN'T HIT PEOPLE.

19:04.163 --> 19:06.132
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY SAY.

19:06.132 --> 19:08.567
YOU TAKE THINGS
TOO PERSONALLY.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.102
YOU CAN TAKE THINGS
AS PERSONALLY AS YOU WANT, VIC,

19:10.102 --> 19:11.537
IF YOU CAN HANDLE
YOURSELF.

19:11.537 --> 19:13.572
YEAH, THATCHER,
I'VE GOT THIS, REALLY.

19:13.572 --> 19:17.209
OH, COME ON, JACK.

19:17.209 --> 19:19.111
HE'S BECOMING A MAN.

19:19.111 --> 19:21.213
DON'T BABY HIM.

19:26.452 --> 19:28.888
POWER'S BACK.

20:07.693 --> 20:09.995
VAL, COME ON.
WE'RE GOING.

20:21.207 --> 20:23.843
YOU NEED
TO SHORE UP THE SECURITY SYSTEM

20:23.843 --> 20:25.911
SO THAT
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

20:25.911 --> 20:27.113
TOTALLY. WILL DO.

20:27.113 --> 20:30.015
I'M ASSUMING,
WITH YOUR PARTICULAR SKILL SET,

20:30.015 --> 20:32.218
YOU'D KNOW HOW TO HACK
INTO SOMEONE'S FINANCIAL RECORDS

20:32.218 --> 20:33.686
WITHOUT THEM KNOWING.
IN MY SLEEP.

20:33.686 --> 20:36.188
ALL RIGHT,
CHECK THIS GUY OUT.

20:36.188 --> 20:38.958
SEE WHAT HIS DEAL IS,
HIS HISTORY.

20:38.958 --> 20:39.959
DIG DEEP.

20:39.959 --> 20:42.528
FRANK PERKINS --
YOU GOT IT, BIG MAC.

20:42.528 --> 20:45.865
THAT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU,
EITHER, IS IT?

20:45.865 --> 20:47.032
GOT IT.

21:55.968 --> 21:58.404
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

21:58.404 --> 22:01.273
MR. VOLTAN?

22:05.611 --> 22:09.281
THE FIRST MOVEMENT
ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL SICK.

22:09.281 --> 22:12.218
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:12.218 --> 22:17.122
THE BROODING PROGRESSIONS,
THE UNRESOLVED DISSONANCE,

22:17.122 --> 22:20.626
THE RELENTLESS TUMULT --
IT'S TORTURE.

22:20.626 --> 22:25.264
BUT I THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF
YOUR FAVORITE SONATAS TO PLAY.

22:25.264 --> 22:26.932
IT'S A CONCERTO.

22:26.932 --> 22:29.502
SORRY. CONCERTO.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.240
WHY PLAY SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO THROW UP?

22:37.076 --> 22:39.411
IN ARGENTINA,
WE SAY,

22:39.411 --> 22:43.983
<i>"EL QUE ALGO QUIERE,</i>
<i>ALGO LE CUESTA."</i>

22:43.983 --> 22:46.752
"IF YOU WANT THE FRUIT,
YOU MUST CLIMB THE TREE."

22:46.752 --> 22:49.088
OKAY.

22:49.088 --> 22:53.359
THE FIRST MOVEMENT
OF THE BRAHMS -- IT IS TORTURE.

22:53.359 --> 22:55.427
BUT IT IS THE STRUGGLE
THAT MAKES --

22:55.427 --> 22:58.764
MAKES THE JOY OF THE REST
SO SWEET.

22:58.764 --> 23:01.667
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING
ONE TELLS ONESELF

23:01.667 --> 23:04.169
JUST TO JUSTIFY
BEING MISERABLE?

23:04.169 --> 23:06.472
I DON'T HAVE TO
JUSTIFY ANYTHING.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.774
YOU ARE AN ARTIST,
RIGHT?

23:08.774 --> 23:10.843
I MEAN, DO YOU NOT
SOMETIMES SEE THINGS

23:10.843 --> 23:13.112
THAT BOTH INSPIRE YOU
AND HURT YOU?

23:13.112 --> 23:15.614
THE FANTASY
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE REAL?

23:15.614 --> 23:21.687
THERE'S NO --
NO PASSION WITHOUT PAIN.

23:21.687 --> 23:25.991
I SUPPOSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS A BIT OF A CLICHé.

23:27.927 --> 23:32.831
YOU WOULD MAKE
A VERY LAZY PIANIST.

23:36.335 --> 23:39.972
YOUR BOY PERKINS
IS A COLORFUL DUDE.

23:39.972 --> 23:43.242
BUNCH OF FISCAL INCONSISTENCIES,
THE FINANCIALS ARE WHACK,

23:43.242 --> 23:44.977
NO CELLPHONE,
NO UTILITIES.

23:44.977 --> 23:47.146
YOU ASK ME, HIS COMPANY
ISN'T A COMPANY AT ALL.

23:47.146 --> 23:48.781
CAN YOU GET ME
SOME PAPER COPIES, PLEASE?

23:48.781 --> 23:51.183
PAPER IS SO 2010,
JACK.

23:51.183 --> 23:53.419
CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENT.

24:00.225 --> 24:02.061
SO HE'S A CON MAN?

24:02.061 --> 24:03.162
TOTAL SHELL.

24:03.162 --> 24:06.365
HIS BUSINESS ADDRESS --
IT'S A P.O. BOX.

24:06.365 --> 24:09.602
FRANKIE BOY'S RUNNING THIS THING
OUT OF A POST OFFICE.

24:09.602 --> 24:12.371
SON OF A BITCH.

24:12.371 --> 24:14.740
HELLO, FRANK.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.041
JACK.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.042
WHAT A SURPRISE.

24:17.042 --> 24:18.744
HOW ABOUT WE TAKE A RIDE?

24:18.744 --> 24:20.279
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

24:20.279 --> 24:21.380
WHERE YOU GOING?

24:21.380 --> 24:24.516
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
I STOLE YOUR MONEY.

24:24.516 --> 24:26.685
DID YOU?
I-I -- NO! I -- HEY!

24:26.685 --> 24:28.654
DID YOU KILL LOU
TO COVER IT UP?

24:28.654 --> 24:30.322
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY!

24:30.322 --> 24:32.257
LOOK,
TIMES ARE TOUGH, OKAY?

24:32.257 --> 24:33.359
MY BUSINESS WENT UNDER.

24:33.359 --> 24:35.194
I GOT IN
ON THE LOFTS PROJECT WITH LOU

24:35.194 --> 24:36.762
TO HELP ME
GET BACK ON MY FEET.

24:36.762 --> 24:37.930
SHUT UP.

24:37.930 --> 24:39.231
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR YOUR LIFE STORY.

24:39.231 --> 24:41.867
WHERE'S OUR MONEY?
I DON'T HAVE IT, JACK.

24:41.867 --> 24:44.303
ME AND LOU,
WE WERE ON THE UP-AND-UP.

24:44.303 --> 24:46.672
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I WAS SKIMMING A LITTLE, OKAY?

24:46.672 --> 24:47.806
BUT LET'S WORK TOGETHER.

24:47.806 --> 24:49.174
I CAN HELP YOU FIGURE OUT
WHERE IT WENT.

24:49.174 --> 24:50.275
WHAT ABOUT
WHO KILLED LOU?

24:50.275 --> 24:52.645
I GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU THERE.

24:52.645 --> 24:54.546
HONESTLY.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.385
YOU HAVE A CELLPHONE?

24:59.385 --> 25:00.519
YEAH, YEAH.

25:00.519 --> 25:01.520
I'M TAKING IT.
HEY, HEY!

25:01.520 --> 25:02.955
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.

25:02.955 --> 25:04.890
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU STAY IN TOUCH,

25:04.890 --> 25:06.291
OR I SWEAR,
I WILL TRACK YOU DOWN,

25:06.291 --> 25:07.826
AND I WON'T BE SO FRIENDLY
NEXT TIME.

25:07.826 --> 25:11.096
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
GET OFF MY CAR.

25:14.466 --> 25:15.534
LET GO OF ME!

25:15.534 --> 25:17.269
HEY, HEY!
CALM DOWN, CONNIE.

25:17.269 --> 25:18.337
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:18.337 --> 25:20.406
WHEN THEY
OFFERED ME PROTECTION,

25:20.406 --> 25:21.674
I DIDN'T THINK
IT MEANT HOUSE ARREST.

25:21.674 --> 25:22.941
YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS
RIGHT NOW.

25:22.941 --> 25:24.576
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:24.576 --> 25:25.678
NO, I DO.

25:25.678 --> 25:27.279
WELL,
THEN MAKE THESE COPS GO AWAY,

25:27.279 --> 25:28.714
BECAUSE I CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS.

25:28.714 --> 25:31.350
OKAY, LET ME GO WITH HER,
AND IF YOU REALLY NEED TO,

25:31.350 --> 25:33.052
YOU CAN JUST FOLLOW
BEHIND US.

25:33.052 --> 25:34.386
MA'AM,
I HAVE MY ORDERS.

25:34.386 --> 25:36.055
I KNOW, BUT PLEASE --
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

25:36.055 --> 25:37.890
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GET MILK FOR MY TEA.

25:37.890 --> 25:39.058
I FEEL TRAPPED,
ELAINE.

25:39.058 --> 25:40.759
I CAN'T EVEN BREATHE.

26:01.668 --> 26:03.537
OH, IT'S LIKE A CHESS GAME,
VIC.

26:03.537 --> 26:06.139
GOT TO HAVE A STRATEGY,
GOT TO USE YOUR HEAD.

26:06.139 --> 26:09.409
UNH-UNH.
GET YOUR FEET UNDER YOU.

26:10.878 --> 26:12.397
WE TIE THE CAR BOMB
TO KARSTEN,

26:12.397 --> 26:13.732
WE GET HIM
ON ATTEMPTED MURDER,

26:13.732 --> 26:14.800
INTIMIDATING A WITNESS,

26:14.800 --> 26:16.694
IMPEDING
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

26:16.694 --> 26:19.196
COME ON, DREW,
I ALREADY HAVE A PHONE SHEET

26:19.196 --> 26:21.198
LITTERED WITH CALLS
FROM THE FBI.

26:21.198 --> 26:22.967
LET'S TURN IT AROUND,
THEN.

26:22.967 --> 26:26.604
MAKE THE FEDS
WANT TO WORK WITH US.

26:26.604 --> 26:28.372
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT
THROWING PUNCHES, YOU KNOW.

26:28.372 --> 26:29.740
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
IN CONTROL.

26:34.145 --> 26:35.846
JUST AS IMPORTANT TO KNOW
WHEN NOT TO PUNCH.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.515
IT'S ALL WRAPPED TOGETHER,
LARRY --

26:37.515 --> 26:40.551
THE OLD MAN'S DEATH,
THE ATTEMPT ON THE WIDOW,

26:40.551 --> 26:43.421
THE EMBEZZLEMENT SCHEME,
THE FEDERAL PROBE.

26:43.421 --> 26:47.992
YOU PICK THAT FIGHT,
YOU EITHER WIN OR YOU LOSE BAD.

26:47.992 --> 26:51.195
CONTROL YOURSELF.
CONTAIN YOUR EMOTION.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.530
DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY,
DREW.

26:52.530 --> 26:54.865
FEEL THAT ANGER,
THAT RAGE?

26:54.865 --> 26:57.735
GOOD. NOW USE IT.
DON'T LET IT USE YOU.

26:57.735 --> 27:01.706
LARRY, YOU'RE RETIRING IN,
WHAT, A FEW WEEKS, RIGHT?

27:01.706 --> 27:02.940
CUT OFF THE RING.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.376
WHY NOT BRING DOWN THE
KARSTEN EMPIRE ON YOUR WATCH...

27:05.376 --> 27:07.511
BUT DON'T FORCE IT.

27:07.511 --> 27:09.313
...SPEND YOUR LAST DAY
SIGNING THE ARREST WARRANT

27:09.313 --> 27:10.881
FOR THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF?

27:20.124 --> 27:21.993
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO
FOR THE KNOCKOUT...

27:21.993 --> 27:23.661
YOU TAKE A SHOT
AT THE KING...

27:23.661 --> 27:25.296
...YOU BETTER KNOW
HOW TO LAND IT.

27:25.296 --> 27:27.765
...BE SURE
YOU DON'T MISS.

27:27.765 --> 27:28.833
A SAFE HOUSE?

27:28.833 --> 27:31.435
WE CAN'T RISK
ANYTHING HAPPENING TO YOU.

27:31.435 --> 27:34.238
OUR ENTIRE CASE DEPENDS
ON YOUR TESTIFYING AT TRIAL.

27:34.238 --> 27:40.211
YOU WANT
TO M-MOVE ME SOMEWHERE?

27:40.211 --> 27:41.712
YES --

27:41.712 --> 27:43.381
UNDER THE CLOAK
OF PROTECTION.

27:43.381 --> 27:45.783
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

27:45.783 --> 27:49.553
I NEED TIME
TO SAY GOODBYE TO MY FAMILY

27:49.553 --> 27:52.123
AND GET THINGS
IN ORDER.

27:52.123 --> 27:53.924
NOW IS BETTER.
NOW IS SAFEST.

27:53.924 --> 27:56.193
I NEED A DAY.

28:20.785 --> 28:22.553
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

28:22.553 --> 28:24.622
I'M A DEDICATED GUY,
YOU KNOW THAT.

28:24.622 --> 28:27.124
BUT THIS KARSTEN CASE,
THIS GUY McALLISTER --

28:27.124 --> 28:29.827
IT'S LIKE NOTHING
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

28:29.827 --> 28:32.029
I CAN'T EAT,
I CAN'T SLEEP,

28:32.029 --> 28:34.398
I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

28:34.398 --> 28:39.203
WELL, I-I AM TAKING PHOTOS
OF A CLASSICAL CONCERT TONIGHT.

28:39.203 --> 28:41.372
I HAVE TWO V.I.P. PASSES.

28:41.372 --> 28:44.608
AND I WAS THINKING
WE COULD BOTH GO.

28:44.608 --> 28:46.143
DREW?

28:46.143 --> 28:49.580
I WOULD LOVE TO, BABE,
BUT I AM ON A ROLL HERE.

28:49.580 --> 28:52.349
IT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO THAT SUSHI PLACE.

28:52.349 --> 28:53.784
WE COULD GET
A BITE FIRST.

28:53.784 --> 28:55.653
I HAVE JANEY COMING OVER
TO BABYSIT.

28:55.653 --> 28:57.221
HONEY,
I KNOW MY WORK CRAZINESS

28:57.221 --> 28:58.923
MAY BE HARD
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

28:58.923 --> 29:00.758
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.

29:00.758 --> 29:03.761
SO WHY IS THIS
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, SARAH?

29:03.761 --> 29:05.729
IT'S JUST A CONCERT.

29:05.729 --> 29:09.433
AND BESIDES,
WE HATE CLASSICAL MUSIC.

29:16.574 --> 29:18.375
LOU WAS GONNA TESTIFY
TO THE FEDS.

29:18.375 --> 29:20.311
YOU THREATENED HIM
THE NIGHT HE DIED.

29:20.311 --> 29:21.645
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

29:21.645 --> 29:23.914
ELAINE,
WHO GOT IT FROM CONNIE.

29:23.914 --> 29:25.249
OF COURSE SHE DID.

29:25.249 --> 29:26.750
SO WHAT DOES ELAINE THINK?

29:26.750 --> 29:27.918
SHE'S SHOOK UP.

29:27.918 --> 29:29.286
SHE THINKS
YOU'RE BEHIND IT ALL.

29:32.523 --> 29:34.158
I KNEW ABOUT LOU
AND THE FEDS.

29:34.158 --> 29:37.428
AND I DID HAVE A FIGHT WITH HIM
THAT NIGHT, AND THAT'S IT.

29:37.428 --> 29:41.398
AND WHY DID YOU FAIL
TO MENTION ANY OF THIS TO ME?

29:41.398 --> 29:44.168
LOU WAS DEAD.
WHAT WAS THE POINT?

29:44.168 --> 29:47.304
IF YOU'RE LYING, IF YOU'RE
LETTING T.J. TAKE THE HEAT --

29:47.304 --> 29:49.573
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
WE LIED TO THE POLICE

29:49.573 --> 29:52.910
AFTER A FAMILY TRAGEDY,
NOW, WOULD IT, JACK?

29:55.112 --> 29:57.348
THE ACCIDENT WITH T.J.,
THAT WAS -- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

29:57.348 --> 30:01.051
WHY?
BECAUSE IT INVOLVED YOU?

30:01.051 --> 30:05.723
DO YOUR JOB, JACK,
OKAY?

30:05.723 --> 30:09.460
SO, WHERE DO WE STAND
WITH FRANK PERKINS?

30:09.460 --> 30:13.230
HIS COMPANY WAS A SHELL.

30:13.230 --> 30:14.865
THEN HE STOLE
THE MONEY?

30:14.865 --> 30:17.101
HE WAS SKIMMING A LITTLE
OFF THE TOP BUT NOT MUCH --

30:17.101 --> 30:18.135
NOT A MILLION.

30:18.135 --> 30:20.771
THE GUY'S CROOKED,
BUT HE'S SMALL-TIME,

30:20.771 --> 30:22.673
AND I DOUBT
HE'S A KILLER.

30:22.673 --> 30:25.609
ANYONE CAN BE A KILLER,
JACK.

30:25.609 --> 30:28.846
YOU JUST NEED
TO MAKE THE EFFORT.

30:28.846 --> 30:31.715
I'M NOT A KILLER,
LAINIE.

30:31.715 --> 30:33.350
YOU GOT TO
TELL THEM THAT.

30:33.350 --> 30:36.187
WE ARE GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE VERY SOON.

30:36.187 --> 30:39.056
I HEARD AUNT CONNIE
TOLD THEM THAT I DID IT.

30:39.056 --> 30:42.860
NO. N-- SHE TOLD THEM
THAT SHE SAW YOU THAT NIGHT

30:42.860 --> 30:44.562
BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

30:44.562 --> 30:47.231
THEY SAID MY OWN AUNT
RATTED ME OUT.

30:47.231 --> 30:49.466
NO, T.J.,
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

30:49.466 --> 30:51.569
LOOK -- SHE HAD TO
TELL THE TRUTH.

30:51.569 --> 30:53.037
THERE'S A NEW TRUTH.

30:53.037 --> 30:54.672
DID SHE TELL THEM ABOUT THAT,
THE NEW TRUTH?

30:54.672 --> 30:56.607
DON'T -- DON'T -- DON'T --
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT.

30:56.607 --> 31:00.511
DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
WITH ANYONE.

31:02.513 --> 31:04.381
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE, T.J.?

31:06.717 --> 31:08.152
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,
LAINIE.

31:08.152 --> 31:10.454
I KNOW HOW TO.

31:10.454 --> 31:13.090
OF COURSE YOU DO.

31:13.090 --> 31:15.559
YOU'RE A KARSTEN,
AFTER ALL.

31:15.559 --> 31:17.861
WE BOTH ARE.

31:19.096 --> 31:21.966
TILL THE DAY WE DIE.

31:31.991 --> 31:36.663
WHISKEY NEAT --
A GIRL AFTER MY OWN HEART.

31:36.663 --> 31:40.233
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
IN HERE BEFORE.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.335
JUST PASSING THROUGH.

31:42.335 --> 31:45.805
ON VACATION?

31:48.441 --> 31:50.310
NO. WORK.

31:50.310 --> 31:51.878
WHAT DO YOU DO?

31:54.180 --> 31:58.117
I'M A CLASSICAL PIANIST.
I'M ON TOUR.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.287
I'VE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD
CLASSICAL MUSIC.

32:01.287 --> 32:04.424
WELL, IT'S LIKE
ANY OTHER KIND OF MUSIC.

32:04.424 --> 32:08.628
THERE'S TINY VIBRATIONS
THAT MAKE YOU FEEL THINGS.

32:10.697 --> 32:14.500
AND IF YOU'RE REALLY
LISTENING,

32:14.500 --> 32:19.172
IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL JOY...
OR PAIN.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.648
OR BOTH.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.450
LATER, MOM.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.552
WAIT. WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.187
UH, BATTING CAGE
WITH MIKE.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.857
OH, OKAY. COME HERE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

33:13.626 --> 33:15.561
I LOVE YOU, KID.

33:18.931 --> 33:20.633
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

33:25.204 --> 33:26.773
BE CAREFUL.

33:28.708 --> 33:29.842
MOM?

33:29.842 --> 33:31.110
YEAH.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.180
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.481
YEAH.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.251
BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTING
KIND OF WEIRD.

33:38.251 --> 33:42.388
OH, I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT UNCLE T.J.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.823
HE'LL BE FINE.

33:43.823 --> 33:45.792
DAD WILL GET HIM OUT.

33:45.792 --> 33:48.294
YEAH.
YES, HE WILL.

33:52.799 --> 33:55.401
I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.903
WHAT?

33:56.903 --> 34:00.840
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:42.114 --> 34:44.517
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO
FOR THE KNOCKOUT,

34:44.517 --> 34:46.652
YOU BETTER KNOW
HOW TO LAND IT.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.913
A TREASURE TROVE.

35:13.913 --> 35:15.882
HE'S GOT THE RACETRACK
ON SPEED DIAL,

35:15.882 --> 35:18.217
A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
WITH A HEMP CLINIC IN SKOKIE,

35:18.217 --> 35:19.352
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

35:19.352 --> 35:21.153
THE PHONE WAS REGISTERED
TO AN M. HENDRICKS.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.989
PERKINS ISN'T EVEN
THE GUY'S REAL NAME.

35:22.989 --> 35:24.190
SO WHO WAS PERKINS?

35:24.190 --> 35:26.759
NOBODY. AN ALIAS.
BUT GET THIS.

35:26.759 --> 35:29.295
HENDRICKS
MAKES 87 PHONE CALLS

35:29.295 --> 35:31.063
IN THE PAST MONTH
TO ONE NUMBER.

35:31.063 --> 35:32.098
WHO WAS HE CALLING?

35:32.098 --> 35:33.766
LOU MROZEK.

35:33.766 --> 35:34.934
BINGO.

35:34.934 --> 35:36.469
BUT HERE'S
WHERE IT GETS WEIRD.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.504
THE CALLS GET MORE FREQUENT
IN THE PAST WEEK

35:38.504 --> 35:39.539
AFTER YOUR UNCLE DIED.

35:39.539 --> 35:41.240
YOU KNOW WHY?

35:41.240 --> 35:45.444
BECAUSE HE WASN'T
CALLING UNCLE LOU.

35:45.444 --> 35:48.881
CONNIE?

35:54.787 --> 35:58.391
CONNIE?

36:30.156 --> 36:32.625
CONNIE?

36:32.625 --> 36:33.926
I'M SORRY, JACK.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.495
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE LIKE THIS.

36:44.470 --> 36:48.407
FRANK PERKINS.

36:52.768 --> 36:54.323
SHE EMBEZZLED
THE MILLION DOLLARS

36:54.323 --> 36:56.648
FROM THE LOFTS PROJECT.
LOU HAD NO IDEA.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.584
HE LET THATCHER TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HIM FOR 30 YEARS.

36:59.584 --> 37:00.986
I HAD TO GET US OUR DUE.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.187
SHE HAD AN ACCOMPLICE,

37:02.187 --> 37:04.656
A SMALL-TIME ACCOUNTANT
NAMED MATTHEW HENDRICKS.

37:04.656 --> 37:07.726
SHE PAID HIM A CUT
TO HELP SIPHON THE MONEY.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.095
I CAME UP
WITH THE NAME FRANK PERKINS.

37:10.095 --> 37:13.165
A SHELL COMPANY THAT
ALLOWED THEM UNMONITORED ACCESS

37:13.165 --> 37:15.834
TO OUR PROJECT MONEY.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.537
PERKINS WAS A SILENT PARTNER,
ALMOST NEVER AROUND.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.746
HENDRICKS --
WELL, HE PLAYED THE ROLE

37:21.746 --> 37:23.381
AT THE OCCASIONAL
PROJECT MEETING.

37:23.381 --> 37:26.184
AND AFTER I TRACKED HIM DOWN,
HENDRICKS GOT PANICKY.

37:26.184 --> 37:28.786
HE TALKED TO CONNIE.

37:28.786 --> 37:31.689
SHE KNEW
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

37:31.689 --> 37:34.992
BEFORE IT ALL
FELL APART.

37:37.261 --> 37:39.797
SO SHE CONVINCED HENDRICKS

37:39.797 --> 37:43.801
TO HELP HER
DO SOMETHING DRASTIC.

37:47.739 --> 37:50.641
WHY WOULD SHE STAGE
THIS ELABORATE PIECE OF THEATER

37:50.641 --> 37:51.976
JUST FOR ELAINE?

37:51.976 --> 37:55.446
TO CONVINCE ELAINE THAT HER LIFE
WAS IN IMMINENT DANGER.

37:55.446 --> 37:57.715
CONNIE NEEDED HER HELP
TO ESCAPE.

38:00.318 --> 38:03.488
SHE STOLE A MILLION DOLLARS
OF YOUR FATHER'S MONEY.

38:03.488 --> 38:05.289
HE'S NOT GONNA MISS IT.

38:05.289 --> 38:06.390
ELAINE, WHY?

38:06.390 --> 38:07.925
WHY WOULD YOU
AGREE TO HELP HER

38:07.925 --> 38:09.660
AFTER SHE MANIPULATED YOU
LIKE THAT?

38:09.660 --> 38:13.131
JA-- I'M USED TO BEING
MANIPULATED, JACK.

38:13.131 --> 38:14.132
HANDLED.

38:14.132 --> 38:15.967
THAT'S NORMAL
TO ME NOW.

38:15.967 --> 38:18.369
YOU KNOW,
CONNIE WAS A GOOD PERSON.

38:18.369 --> 38:21.439
SHE JUST GOT ALL TURNED AROUND
BY THIS FAMILY.

38:21.439 --> 38:23.407
AND MY BROTHER
IS INNOCENT.

38:23.407 --> 38:25.843
HE'S GONNA GET EATEN ALIVE
IN JAIL.

38:25.843 --> 38:29.714
SO WITH CONNIE GONE,
THEY'RE BOTH FREE.

38:31.749 --> 38:34.952
TWO BIRDS, ONE STONE,
JACK.

38:34.952 --> 38:38.756
YOU REALLY ARE A KARSTEN
AFTER ALL.

38:39.824 --> 38:45.596
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.

38:45.596 --> 38:48.299
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT

38:48.299 --> 38:50.101
HOW THINGS
COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT?

38:50.101 --> 38:51.169
OH, COME ON.

38:51.169 --> 38:53.137
NO. DO YOU?

38:58.476 --> 39:02.613
YEAH, I DO SOMETIMES.

39:07.185 --> 39:10.121
CONNIE HAD A SHOT AT ESCAPE
AND A CHANCE TO START OVER.

39:10.121 --> 39:15.593
I MEAN, THAT'S -- THAT'S MORE
THAN I CAN SAY FOR US.

39:32.476 --> 39:34.879
WHOA.

39:34.879 --> 39:36.013
YOU'RE WORKING HARD.

39:36.013 --> 39:37.849
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
SO LATE?

39:37.849 --> 39:41.452
CLEARANCE ISSUES,
THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE.

39:41.452 --> 39:43.487
HOW WAS THE CONCERT?

39:43.487 --> 39:46.891
IT WAS, UM --
IT WAS KIND OF INCREDIBLE.

39:46.891 --> 39:48.125
LOOK.

39:51.863 --> 39:54.732
SARA. WOW.

40:06.544 --> 40:10.214
IT WAS LIKE NOTHING
I'D EVER SEEN BEFORE.

40:10.214 --> 40:12.617
HE WAS
TOTALLY CONSUMED,

40:12.617 --> 40:15.653
TRANSPORTED TO
THIS OTHER PLANE.

40:15.653 --> 40:19.891
AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING
HE SAID TO ME MADE SENSE.

40:19.891 --> 40:23.127
I'VE BEEN LAZY.

40:23.127 --> 40:25.563
LAZY? HOW?

40:25.563 --> 40:27.398
AVOIDANT. AFRAID.

40:27.398 --> 40:30.401
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

40:30.401 --> 40:32.336
W-WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

40:32.336 --> 40:36.274
JOY, PAIN,
ALL OF IT.

40:38.109 --> 40:40.645
I WANT TO DO A SERIES
ON OBSESSION,

40:40.645 --> 40:42.747
BUT WHAT DO I KNOW
ABOUT IT?

40:42.747 --> 40:45.016
WHAT DO I KNOW
ABOUT ANYTHING?

40:45.016 --> 40:47.652
ALL I'VE EVER DONE
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE

40:47.652 --> 40:51.322
IS BE ON THE OUTSIDE OBSERVING
BECAUSE I'M JUST AFRAID.

40:51.322 --> 40:53.724
I'M AFRAID OF FEELING.

40:53.724 --> 40:56.227
FEELING WHAT?

40:56.227 --> 40:59.230
THE MAGNITUDE
OF THINGS.

41:11.309 --> 41:15.846
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME
A WEEK AGO,

41:15.846 --> 41:17.882
AND IT CHANGED ME.

41:17.882 --> 41:20.051
CHANGED YOU HOW?

41:20.051 --> 41:24.488
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO MAKE IT GO AWAY, BUT I CAN'T.

41:27.992 --> 41:29.193
IT'S LIKE
THERE'S THIS DOOR,

41:29.193 --> 41:32.763
AND ONCE I OPENED IT,
EVERYTHING SHIFTED.

41:32.763 --> 41:36.000
WHAT HAPPENED
A WEEK AGO?

41:37.068 --> 41:38.970
I MET SOMEONE.

41:43.808 --> 41:47.945
AND NOW
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.
