WEBVTT

00:01.358 --> 00:03.024
People died, and you denied it.

00:03.027 --> 00:05.766
I tried to do right, and you stopped me.

00:05.768 --> 00:07.085
I left Carson.

00:07.088 --> 00:08.621
Can I stay with you and the girls?

00:08.624 --> 00:10.256
I have the right to have a baby.

00:10.259 --> 00:11.926
How are you gonna provide?

00:11.929 --> 00:14.275
Customers buy tokens online.

00:14.277 --> 00:16.143
And they like what you're
doing, they'll tip you.

00:16.145 --> 00:18.179
It's just what you want
to do to get tipped.

00:18.181 --> 00:21.804
I am killing myself in that
office seven days a week.

00:21.807 --> 00:24.351
We hired a nanny so you can
just sit around and write checks.

00:24.353 --> 00:26.187
I hired a nanny so there'd
be somebody else in the house

00:26.189 --> 00:28.956
to help take care of our son.

02:14.563 --> 02:17.064
- Hey, guys!
- Sorry we're late.

02:17.066 --> 02:20.567
We were about to send
out a search party.

02:20.569 --> 02:21.834
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.671
We got a table. We got
a table right over here.

02:23.673 --> 02:24.672
- Hello.
- Right over here.

02:24.674 --> 02:27.675
We went through a rough stretch.

02:27.677 --> 02:28.742
We did.

02:28.744 --> 02:30.744
But, you know, we're still making.

02:30.746 --> 02:32.579
America's most comfortable furniture.

02:32.581 --> 02:34.915
Well, you're a hell of a businessman.

02:34.917 --> 02:36.583
And he owns the trademark.

02:36.585 --> 02:38.252
Yeah.

02:38.254 --> 02:39.753
Right, yeah, simple as that.

02:39.755 --> 02:41.722
Owning the trademark...
Anybody can do it.

02:41.724 --> 02:43.223
Hey, how's Nicky?

02:43.225 --> 02:44.892
He is so great.

02:44.894 --> 02:48.062
Let me show you. He's so cute.

02:48.064 --> 02:51.065
He's a little man now!

02:51.067 --> 02:53.167
Yeah. It goes fast.

02:53.169 --> 02:55.669
Yeah, I really wish I'd
taken in those years,

02:55.671 --> 02:58.272
those early years, just a
little bit more, you know?

02:58.274 --> 03:00.941
It was... It was tough. It
was harder than I thought.

03:00.943 --> 03:02.943
You get... You get so stressed-out,

03:02.945 --> 03:04.945
you don't even realize
how it's affecting you.

03:04.947 --> 03:08.449
And now he's grown,
and now it's no more stress.

03:08.451 --> 03:10.284
It's... It's enjoyment.

03:10.286 --> 03:11.618
Here. Look here.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.120
He just learned how to ride a bike.

03:13.122 --> 03:14.121
- Look at him.
- Aww.

03:14.123 --> 03:15.789
That's so... Aww.

03:15.791 --> 03:17.291
- That's great.
- Isn't he cute?

03:17.293 --> 03:18.792
It must be so wonderful.

03:18.794 --> 03:20.361
Yeah, yeah, it's so wonderful,

03:20.363 --> 03:22.997
Clair went and got herself
a nanny to do all the work.

03:25.034 --> 03:27.368
Damn. You're up, Helen.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.203
She doesn't do all the work.

03:29.205 --> 03:31.820
No, she doesn't do all the work.
She just does all your work.

03:33.876 --> 03:36.477
And, she only speaks French.

03:36.479 --> 03:39.645
Clair... Clair went and got
a nanny who only speaks French.

03:39.648 --> 03:41.648
- What? She sounds hot.
- Scott!

03:41.650 --> 03:43.484
- I'm just...
- She's very sweet.

03:43.486 --> 03:45.819
Well, unless you ask her
to do something in English,

03:45.821 --> 03:46.954
and then she's just somebody who

03:46.956 --> 03:48.556
doesn't understand a word you're saying.

03:50.626 --> 03:53.127
Come on. Let's go, Scott.

03:53.129 --> 03:57.064
Let's end this thing. I-I
got to work in the morning.

03:57.066 --> 03:58.699
So sad, so sad!

03:58.701 --> 04:01.001
Would you just...

04:01.003 --> 04:02.936
Okay, Clair, come on.

04:02.938 --> 04:03.971
Win this for us.

04:03.973 --> 04:07.241
Yeah. Come on, Clair. It's just a game.

04:07.243 --> 04:08.876
That's it, no big deal,

04:08.878 --> 04:11.145
no pressure, just bragging rights.

04:11.147 --> 04:12.312
That's all.

04:12.314 --> 04:13.483
Watch. Look... Look how... Watch how...

04:13.485 --> 04:15.315
She's trying to figure this out.

04:15.317 --> 04:16.382
I mean, you... You can just...

04:16.385 --> 04:17.851
You can just see her
little mind working.

04:17.853 --> 04:20.620
Quit. You're making her nervous.

04:20.623 --> 04:22.689
No, he's not.

04:22.691 --> 04:25.292
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- You cannot make Clair nervous.

04:25.294 --> 04:27.594
Nope. No, she was a
hell of a businessman.

04:27.596 --> 04:28.896
She got things done.

04:28.898 --> 04:30.577
Of course, that was
before she gave it all up

04:30.579 --> 04:31.878
to... to stay at home.

04:33.282 --> 04:36.082
You sit around all day doing nothing,

04:36.084 --> 04:39.819
get used to people doing things for you.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.122
Maybe you're not so sharp anymore.

04:42.124 --> 04:44.557
Just let her... Let her shoot, Nick.

04:44.559 --> 04:47.827
Just go ahead and shoot, Clair.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.765
Or maybe you want the
nanny to do it for you.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.401
8 ball, corner pocket.

04:54.403 --> 04:57.337
Ooh!

04:57.339 --> 04:59.673
That's my girl.

05:01.143 --> 05:04.411
Well...

05:05.580 --> 05:08.181
You know, Nick thinks
nobody speaks French,

05:08.183 --> 05:09.816
but you speak French, right, Helen?

05:09.818 --> 05:13.086
I'm rusty, but...

05:13.088 --> 05:16.356
Je ne pouvais pas tomber enceinte

05:16.358 --> 05:19.262
parce que Nicholas
est impuissant.

05:19.265 --> 05:23.528
C'est la cause de lui si on
ne pouvait pas avoir d'enfant.

05:27.235 --> 05:28.994
It was really nice seeing you guys.

05:28.997 --> 05:30.863
I'm tired.

05:33.842 --> 05:35.471
What did she say?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.359
What did she say?

06:20.561 --> 06:23.161
Hey.

06:23.163 --> 06:24.462
Hey.

06:24.464 --> 06:25.730
Should I quit?

06:25.732 --> 06:26.898
No.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.733
Got to hang in there.

06:28.735 --> 06:31.770
I know. Bills are piling it up as it is.

06:31.772 --> 06:33.405
I just sometimes figure, you know,

06:33.407 --> 06:35.674
maybe I do like the rich people do...

06:35.676 --> 06:37.943
Get a lot of debt and let
the banks figure it out.

06:40.214 --> 06:42.180
How's being pregnant?

06:42.182 --> 06:43.684
Good.

06:46.553 --> 06:48.520
Is that a new picture?

06:48.522 --> 06:51.122
Same one.

06:51.124 --> 06:53.558
You got to start seeing a doctor.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.494
You know, you got to start
taking care of yourself.

06:56.496 --> 06:57.829
I will.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.666
How are you doing?

07:01.668 --> 07:04.736
Kelli's not doing so good...

07:04.738 --> 07:06.137
not doing too good at all.

07:06.139 --> 07:08.607
Can I talk to her?

07:10.244 --> 07:12.244
Just let me talk to her.

07:21.655 --> 07:24.789
Hey, girl. What you doing?

07:26.293 --> 07:29.060
Cassi's starting to show now.

07:29.062 --> 07:32.163
Yeah.

07:32.165 --> 07:35.100
See that?

07:35.102 --> 07:37.702
That's the future right there...

07:37.704 --> 07:39.037
my future.

07:45.579 --> 07:47.379
Hey, Kelli,

07:47.381 --> 07:49.578
want me to put on a little show for you?

07:55.555 --> 07:57.689
Rex, you can watch, too.

07:59.159 --> 08:01.626
Help your girl have a good time.

08:59.586 --> 09:01.720
That's sweet of you, Rex.

09:01.722 --> 09:04.956
Well, I can't retire,
but maybe you can...

09:04.958 --> 09:06.800
maybe you and your baby.

09:17.204 --> 09:19.037
For the whole week?

09:19.039 --> 09:21.306
Yeah, the whole week.

09:24.044 --> 09:28.580
Hey, you been signing
up and doing chores?

09:28.582 --> 09:30.048
Yeah.

09:30.050 --> 09:31.983
Got to do chores, all right?

09:31.985 --> 09:34.619
Got to help out.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.405
Kimara?

09:53.407 --> 09:55.040
Greg, hey.

09:55.042 --> 09:56.674
- Hey.
- How are you?

09:56.676 --> 09:57.976
I'm good. I'm good.

09:57.978 --> 10:00.945
Well, it's good to see
you outside of Virginia.

10:00.947 --> 10:03.415
You know, making the rounds,
getting out in the real world.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.517
Well, we... We appreciate it.

10:05.519 --> 10:07.986
Y'all are such great supporters.

10:07.989 --> 10:11.465
And if you happen to be
bearing a sizable donation,

10:11.467 --> 10:13.100
it would not be turned down.

10:13.102 --> 10:15.525
You know we're always
just one proposal away.

10:15.528 --> 10:16.830
It's actually part of the reason

10:16.833 --> 10:18.369
why I wanted to steal
a bit of your time.

10:18.371 --> 10:19.973
- Okay.
- So, you know we fund the

10:19.976 --> 10:21.575
downtown Greensboro shelter.

10:21.577 --> 10:22.699
- Yeah.
- I just came from a

10:22.702 --> 10:23.964
meeting with Abby Tanaka.

10:23.970 --> 10:26.738
- She loves you.
- Aww. The feeling is mutual.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.874
She is... Well, they are doing
such great work over there.

10:29.876 --> 10:30.875
- Yeah. They are.
- Yeah.

10:30.877 --> 10:32.343
We're in the final stages of getting

10:32.345 --> 10:33.645
a grant approval for the shelter.

10:33.647 --> 10:35.113
Yeah. She told me.

10:35.115 --> 10:37.082
Honestly, it couldn't have happened

10:37.084 --> 10:39.350
without the involvement
of people like yourself.

10:39.352 --> 10:41.820
I just transition people there.

10:41.822 --> 10:43.455
They do all the work.

10:43.457 --> 10:46.758
Kimara, 105 people to
the shelter last year?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.546
That's pretty tireless.

10:48.549 --> 10:51.162
Yeah.

10:51.164 --> 10:53.298
Yeah, it's... it's work.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.266
Anyway...

10:57.437 --> 11:00.105
I just need you to
confirm the numbers for us.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.527
So Abby gave you these?

11:04.530 --> 11:06.111
Yeah.

11:06.113 --> 11:09.848
I need to check with
my notes from last year.

11:09.850 --> 11:11.349
Sure. You... You want to
print something up or...

11:11.351 --> 11:13.151
Um, I keep handwritten notes.

11:13.153 --> 11:14.786
I'm a bit of a technophobe.

11:16.423 --> 11:18.723
Must be a mess when y'all
have to write up proposals.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.358
Let me make a copy of this.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.559
You can just keep it.

11:21.562 --> 11:24.796
I hate to make a deal
out of this, but I just...

11:24.798 --> 11:26.297
I have to put something
in front of the board.

11:26.299 --> 11:28.900
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

11:33.439 --> 11:34.906
Hello. This is Abby.

11:34.908 --> 11:38.843
Abby. This is Kimara.

11:38.845 --> 11:41.279
Hey. What's up?

11:41.281 --> 11:44.082
You know Greg Stephens?

11:44.084 --> 11:46.684
Greg? Yeah.

11:46.686 --> 11:48.653
Well, he came by my office.

11:48.655 --> 11:52.757
He wanted me to confirm that I
placed 105 kids at your shelter.

11:57.697 --> 12:00.298
Hello?

12:00.300 --> 12:03.234
Um, can we talk?

12:03.236 --> 12:05.870
That's what we're doing... Talking.

12:06.973 --> 12:10.041
I can't do this while I'm in my office.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.676
Can we talk?

12:11.678 --> 12:13.478
I'm sorry he came to you.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.979
Are you sorry he came to me,

12:14.981 --> 12:17.649
or are you sorry that
you're committing fraud?

12:17.651 --> 12:19.951
It's not fraud.

12:19.953 --> 12:23.054
That's why you left your
office so you can talk about it?

12:23.056 --> 12:24.689
'Cause you're not doing anything wrong?

12:24.691 --> 12:27.343
- I should have told you.
- You shouldn't have lied.

12:27.346 --> 12:28.927
What are you doing, Abby?

12:28.929 --> 12:32.030
That foundation Greg works
for wants to give us money,

12:32.032 --> 12:36.100
a lot of money if we
can hit the benchmarks

12:36.102 --> 12:37.902
we outlined in last year's proposal.

12:37.904 --> 12:39.204
But you can't hit them.

12:39.206 --> 12:41.172
The number of people out
there who need shelter?

12:41.174 --> 12:43.141
Yeah, we could hit those easily...

12:43.143 --> 12:46.711
if we had more beds,
if we had more staff.

12:46.713 --> 12:48.680
Then explain that to Greg.

12:50.317 --> 12:53.751
We don't get the money if
we can't hit the numbers.

12:53.753 --> 12:57.055
And we can't hit the numbers
if we don't have the money.

12:57.057 --> 13:00.291
105 clients?

13:00.359 --> 13:02.260
105 clients?

13:02.262 --> 13:06.497
That's, what, 40 more than
I placed in your shelter?

13:06.499 --> 13:08.933
Well, h-how many times did you
call me looking for bed space?

13:08.935 --> 13:10.735
Making a phone call
and placing a person...

13:10.737 --> 13:13.037
'Cause it was at least that many
times, probably more...

13:13.039 --> 13:16.274
No, probably more, but we
didn't have any beds for them.

13:16.276 --> 13:21.012
So that is 40 runaways
we couldn't place.

13:21.014 --> 13:24.449
That is 40 women trying to get out of

13:24.451 --> 13:27.164
abusive relationships
we had to turn away.

13:29.121 --> 13:32.222
Are you doing this with
any other case workers?

13:32.224 --> 13:35.325
I am trying to get people
in need a place to stay.

13:35.327 --> 13:37.460
So is Greg's foundation.

13:37.462 --> 13:40.764
All you have to do is
say we got it right.

13:40.766 --> 13:43.032
That's not all I have to do.

13:43.034 --> 13:46.302
I keep written records,
and Greg want to see them.

13:46.304 --> 13:48.738
Okay.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.874
"Okay"?

13:50.876 --> 13:53.009
I'd have to fake a logbook.

13:53.011 --> 13:54.886
So what?

13:54.889 --> 13:58.148
Honest to God, so what?

13:58.150 --> 14:00.617
You are out there every single day,

14:00.619 --> 14:02.419
swimming through the worst of the worst,

14:02.421 --> 14:04.854
documenting what you tried to do.

14:04.856 --> 14:07.690
You have a problem with that?

14:07.692 --> 14:09.292
You ever hear anything back from

14:09.294 --> 14:11.594
that girl who disappeared
on you... Shae?

14:11.596 --> 14:12.896
I mean, the police trying to help you?

14:12.898 --> 14:14.931
Abby, don't you drag my
client into your bull...

14:14.933 --> 14:17.834
Okay, well, it's the truth, isn't it?

14:17.836 --> 14:19.302
Right.

14:19.304 --> 14:21.137
You don't want to lie,

14:21.139 --> 14:24.407
but you have a problem with the truth.

14:24.409 --> 14:26.676
You and me... We've got I don't know

14:26.678 --> 14:29.279
how many people out
there just like your Shae.

14:29.281 --> 14:31.548
They are out there.

14:31.550 --> 14:33.183
You can't do anything to help them.

14:33.185 --> 14:34.818
I can't do anything.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.454
And along comes this guy
with his rich benefactors,

14:37.456 --> 14:40.890
and he's like, "Yeah, we
want to solve your problems."

14:40.892 --> 14:44.039
Just show them what
kind of numbers you do."

14:44.042 --> 14:48.431
So, I can show them what we do.

14:48.433 --> 14:51.234
And that's exactly the
amount of help we'll get,

14:51.236 --> 14:52.869
nothing more.

14:52.871 --> 14:54.537
The needle doesn't move.

14:54.539 --> 14:57.006
- Or I...
- You can lie.

15:01.146 --> 15:03.613
I'm... I'm... I'm really starting

15:03.615 --> 15:05.081
to get offended by this conversation.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.717
Geez...

15:07.719 --> 15:09.719
Money is not coming into my pocket.

15:09.721 --> 15:13.256
I'm not... I'm not
making a dime from this.

15:15.594 --> 15:21.231
I am asking you to change a 3 into a 6.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.901
Abby, I don't want to lose my job.

15:24.903 --> 15:26.202
Quit.

15:26.204 --> 15:27.871
If we get this money,

15:27.873 --> 15:30.840
we can open up a
long-term housing unit.

15:30.842 --> 15:34.310
I have to hire a full-time case manager.

15:34.312 --> 15:38.448
Pays probably eight grand
more than you're making.

15:38.450 --> 15:40.283
So now you're bribing me?

15:40.285 --> 15:42.585
How much did they cut your budget by?

15:42.587 --> 15:44.587
They want you to do
twice the amount of work

15:44.589 --> 15:46.623
with half the resources.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.194
I am saying...

15:51.196 --> 15:55.331
you can do what you
need, be fully funded,

15:55.333 --> 15:58.668
plus get paid what you're worth.

15:58.670 --> 16:02.138
So it is about money
in somebody's pocket.

16:02.140 --> 16:04.674
I'd make the hire anyway.

16:06.344 --> 16:08.845
Might as well be you.

16:08.847 --> 16:10.880
It should be you.

16:16.846 --> 16:19.499
If it's not...

16:19.502 --> 16:23.204
that's all I'll feel badly about.

16:42.462 --> 16:44.297
Getting up, Auntie? Getting up?

16:44.300 --> 16:47.219
Yeah. I'm getting up.

16:49.055 --> 16:50.521
You got school.

16:50.523 --> 16:51.789
- Yep.
- Yeah.

16:51.791 --> 16:53.791
Go get ready.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.669
Here you go.

17:04.671 --> 17:06.471
I'm glad you're here.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.205
Aww. I'm glad I'm here, too.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.863
How long are you staying?

17:09.866 --> 17:11.608
All right, girls, finish getting ready.

17:11.611 --> 17:12.910
We got to go.

17:12.912 --> 17:15.512
Brush your teeth. Your aunt
will be there when you come back.

17:17.517 --> 17:19.450
I'll do that. I'll do that.

17:19.452 --> 17:22.086
Yeah. Here you go.

17:24.828 --> 17:25.828
Sleep okay?

17:26.992 --> 17:28.626
I know you've got that
thing with your back.

17:28.628 --> 17:30.595
It was fine.

17:32.332 --> 17:34.265
Carson called.

17:34.267 --> 17:35.433
When?

17:35.435 --> 17:37.301
This morning, on my cell.

17:37.303 --> 17:39.853
Wanted to know if you were here.

17:39.856 --> 17:42.240
What did you say?

17:42.242 --> 17:44.509
"I haven't heard from her."

17:44.511 --> 17:46.177
Thank you.

17:49.916 --> 17:52.049
Did he do something to you?

17:52.051 --> 17:53.818
No, not to me.

17:53.820 --> 17:56.954
Then when are you gonna call him?

17:56.956 --> 17:58.890
He's worried.

17:58.892 --> 18:01.659
You're concerned about Carson now?

18:01.661 --> 18:03.961
He's a good guy.

18:03.963 --> 18:06.697
I wouldn't mind having
a man around right now.

18:10.970 --> 18:13.938
- Ready.
- All right, girls.

18:13.940 --> 18:16.507
Kiss your auntie, then
come get in the car.

18:16.509 --> 18:18.309
I love you. Mwah!

18:18.311 --> 18:20.111
I love you. Mwah!

18:25.018 --> 18:26.450
Shut the door!

18:30.356 --> 18:31.522
Okay.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.540
Really?

18:49.542 --> 18:51.842
You only made enough for yourself?

19:04.991 --> 19:09.226
Got any... big plans for the day?

19:09.228 --> 19:12.797
Anything at all you're
planning on doing?

19:14.901 --> 19:18.803
Okay.

19:18.805 --> 19:21.238
I got to go to work.

19:48.201 --> 19:50.968
Gabrielle.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.803
Gabrielle!

20:23.588 --> 20:24.902
No.

20:48.094 --> 20:50.361
It's a strategic "partnership,"
as they put it.

20:50.363 --> 20:53.597
The Coates brand still means
something in some territories,

20:53.599 --> 20:55.566
but these guys know

20:55.568 --> 20:58.502
you can't manufacture at
a competitive price point.

20:58.504 --> 20:59.637
Nicholas.

20:59.639 --> 21:01.906
Just... What's the partnership?

21:01.908 --> 21:04.075
They would take on 70% of the manu costs

21:04.077 --> 21:06.343
for a 51% stake in the company.

21:06.345 --> 21:08.145
70% to 51%. So... So they...

21:08.147 --> 21:10.581
They'd be taking on the
cost, and we get cash?

21:10.583 --> 21:13.384
- They would take on our debt.
- Well, they can have it.

21:13.386 --> 21:15.186
They get majority ownership.

21:15.188 --> 21:17.088
We get production at 30%.

21:17.090 --> 21:19.379
They would be billing themselves.

21:19.382 --> 21:20.858
They can say their rate
is whatever they want.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.960
Look, don't... don't bring
me a deal to piss on it.

21:22.962 --> 21:24.895
You explore this thing
or bring me something...

21:24.897 --> 21:27.398
- I don't think...
- I can't deal with this now.

21:30.169 --> 21:33.771
Just consider all your options.

21:43.950 --> 21:45.082
Hey.

21:45.084 --> 21:46.717
Just got the message you're here.

21:46.719 --> 21:48.352
- Hey, I-I really...
- I had to finish a closing.

21:48.354 --> 21:50.488
I-I-I should have called,
but I... You know, I wasn't...

21:50.490 --> 21:53.390
I don't think the
phone's the best way to...

21:53.392 --> 21:56.026
Look, I don't want to put you
in a bad position, but I think...

21:56.028 --> 21:58.963
I mean, you know, the other
night, you could tell that,

21:58.965 --> 22:02.767
there's a little... a little
tension between me and Clair.

22:02.769 --> 22:06.337
And Clair's got a lot going
on with Nicky, with the nanny,

22:06.339 --> 22:07.705
and since her mother passed.

22:07.707 --> 22:09.673
She didn't take the loss well.

22:09.675 --> 22:10.808
She okay?

22:10.810 --> 22:12.777
Well, you know, I'm...

22:12.779 --> 22:16.380
I'm concerned about her, her behavior.

22:16.382 --> 22:18.015
Concerned how?

22:18.017 --> 22:20.451
Well, you know, she does
things that I don't understand,

22:20.453 --> 22:22.887
like the other night when she...
She spoke to you in French.

22:22.889 --> 22:24.054
I mean, she does that.

22:24.056 --> 22:26.023
She'll just start saying
things in French and...

22:26.025 --> 22:29.760
What... What did she say?

22:29.762 --> 22:31.228
You should talk to Clair.

22:31.230 --> 22:32.696
I did. I did talk to Clair.

22:32.698 --> 22:34.331
She's the one not talking to me.

22:36.002 --> 22:38.135
She was joking.

22:38.137 --> 22:40.437
Well, that's okay.

22:40.439 --> 22:43.086
What did she say?

22:43.089 --> 22:45.709
- Nick, I have appointments.
- Come... come on, Helen.

22:45.711 --> 22:48.112
She walks around speaking French
all the time with that nanny of hers.

22:48.114 --> 22:49.747
She's shutting me out.
She's doing it on purpose.

22:49.749 --> 22:52.716
And she thinks it's funny,
and it's not... it's not funny.

22:52.718 --> 22:56.020
It's... It's ab... Abusive, honestly.

22:56.022 --> 22:58.022
And I-I get sick of it.

22:58.024 --> 22:59.815
And I just want to know what she said,

22:59.818 --> 23:01.292
so just tell me what she said.

23:01.294 --> 23:04.461
What... What did she say?

23:04.463 --> 23:07.431
Talk to Clair, okay?

23:07.433 --> 23:08.999
Talk to your wife.

23:09.001 --> 23:11.669
Okay.

23:11.671 --> 23:14.171
Okay.

23:14.173 --> 23:15.339
I have to get back to work.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.372
Come on, come on, come on. Boom.

23:39.375 --> 23:43.394
You lied. Told me all
the money I could make.

23:43.396 --> 23:44.695
I can't make hardly nothing.

23:44.697 --> 23:45.997
'Cause you're picky.

23:48.367 --> 23:51.268
You want to hit your
cat for charity cases.

23:51.270 --> 23:52.460
You need a daddy.

23:52.463 --> 23:54.205
I need you to all quit taking my money.

23:54.207 --> 23:55.339
I don't get nothing.

23:55.341 --> 23:57.775
You didn't get nothing
for recruiting me?

23:57.777 --> 23:59.710
I did the math.

23:59.712 --> 24:01.645
60% to Everett,

24:01.647 --> 24:05.549
60% of what's left to whatever
slim shady owns the property.

24:05.551 --> 24:09.920
Got to work all week to end up broke.

24:09.922 --> 24:11.889
I was better off with Billy.

24:11.891 --> 24:13.824
Better off in a motel?

24:13.826 --> 24:15.292
This stuff gets tiring.

24:15.294 --> 24:16.594
Guys I was with didn't want to talk.

24:16.596 --> 24:18.195
They just wanted to do it.

24:18.197 --> 24:19.663
Count my own money,

24:19.665 --> 24:22.700
not waiting for tokens to
download off some server.

24:22.702 --> 24:25.547
I got like three clients I can stand.

24:25.550 --> 24:27.284
Get better clients.

24:27.286 --> 24:30.387
Serious. Get some good tippers.

24:30.389 --> 24:32.356
How?

24:32.358 --> 24:35.926
Borrow Tracy's. Tracy's killing it.

24:35.928 --> 24:37.828
She can break you off some of that.

24:37.830 --> 24:39.463
You get paid, so what?

24:39.465 --> 24:41.865
You gonna run back to Billy?

24:44.870 --> 24:46.837
You think he's still in jail?

24:46.839 --> 24:48.939
How am I gonna know?

24:48.941 --> 24:50.574
If I wasn't gonna testify against him,

24:50.576 --> 24:53.176
they'd have to let him go, right?

24:53.178 --> 24:55.645
He'd be pissed as hell you
were gonna talk against him,

24:55.647 --> 24:57.948
so you need to stay away from that boy.

25:00.619 --> 25:04.354
You don't want to go back to
lollipopping dudes in an alley.

25:04.356 --> 25:06.957
You need to figure some other stuff out.

25:13.332 --> 25:14.831
He was real upset.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.099
Well, work has been...

25:16.101 --> 25:18.869
- He was anxious.
- A lot of stress.

25:18.871 --> 25:22.139
I also think being a father
late in life has been hard.

25:22.141 --> 25:24.274
The business isn't doing well.

25:24.276 --> 25:26.410
He denies it, but...

25:26.412 --> 25:27.918
- Is that your nanny?
- Gabrielle?

25:33.318 --> 25:35.018
We are trying to teach her English,

25:35.020 --> 25:37.487
so I'd... I'd rather you...
You didn't talk in French.

25:37.489 --> 25:40.090
Can you go check on Nicky? Nicky?

25:40.092 --> 25:43.093
What happened? Your hand.

25:58.610 --> 26:01.211
She's had some real bad challenges.

26:01.213 --> 26:04.314
She hurts herself. I
caught her doing it.

26:04.316 --> 26:05.782
And honestly, if I'd known some of this

26:05.784 --> 26:08.085
before we brought her
over after the hurricane...

26:08.087 --> 26:09.886
She was in an abusive relationship.

26:09.888 --> 26:11.054
It was bad.

26:11.056 --> 26:14.825
She has some kind of
post-traumatic stress.

26:14.827 --> 26:17.427
My God. Have you gotten her help?

26:17.429 --> 26:18.762
Well, I tried to get her some.

26:18.764 --> 26:20.263
- I mean, have you tried...
- It's hard.

26:20.265 --> 26:23.500
I try to talk to her. I
talk to her in confidence.

26:23.502 --> 26:26.269
See, Nicholas thinks you're
being secretive with her.

26:26.271 --> 26:29.473
Well, I mean, but she's
entitled to her privacy.

26:29.475 --> 26:33.910
And he has just so much going
on anyway that, you know...

26:33.912 --> 26:36.546
I think it's more than that.

26:38.517 --> 26:41.418
What you said about him the other night.

26:41.420 --> 26:42.886
You know, what you said to me...

26:42.888 --> 26:44.321
Well, he was just being an ass.

26:44.323 --> 26:45.889
I'm just not gonna let him be an ass.

26:45.891 --> 26:49.519
Yeah, but was it true?
Was what you said true?

26:49.522 --> 26:51.189
I was being an ass, too.

26:53.665 --> 26:57.300
Well... I'm around if you need me.

26:57.302 --> 27:00.103
We're fine.

27:13.679 --> 27:15.384
Mnh.

27:18.824 --> 27:22.425
You need to watch
yourself. You really do.

27:22.427 --> 27:24.751
I mean, you're doing this to yourself.

27:24.754 --> 27:26.630
Do you understand that?

27:26.632 --> 27:29.290
- I want to...
- No, no. No English.

27:29.293 --> 27:31.134
French.

27:41.180 --> 27:45.415
Well, I mean, you're the
one who just doesn't fit in.

27:45.417 --> 27:47.517
We are doing everything we can

27:47.519 --> 27:50.153
to make you feel a part of this family.

27:50.155 --> 27:52.289
That's... That's... It's difficult.

27:52.291 --> 27:55.859
But we do it because we love you.

27:55.861 --> 27:58.495
We do love you.

28:07.406 --> 28:10.173
So, you studied to be a dietician?

28:10.175 --> 28:13.643
Well um, I studied it a little bit.

28:13.645 --> 28:16.446
My... My mother thought
it was a good idea.

28:16.448 --> 28:18.248
And you've been a homemaker?

28:18.250 --> 28:19.416
Well, no.

28:19.418 --> 28:23.320
I help my husband in his
business, with his clients.

28:23.322 --> 28:25.422
Okay. Employee relations,
business services,

28:25.424 --> 28:27.390
- that kind of thing.
- Yeah, if buyers...

28:27.392 --> 28:29.192
If they would come in from out of town,

28:29.194 --> 28:30.994
if their families
wanted to see the farm,

28:30.996 --> 28:32.329
I would give them tours.

28:32.331 --> 28:35.298
And sometimes when he
would give a speech,

28:35.300 --> 28:36.933
I would introduce him.

28:36.935 --> 28:39.369
Okay, but were you
pay-stubbed by the farm?

28:39.371 --> 28:42.672
Um... I-I'm... I'm
interested in healthcare.

28:42.674 --> 28:43.974
Is that a possibility?

28:43.976 --> 28:45.609
Well, we offer courses for training

28:45.611 --> 28:48.445
as a clinical medical assistant
or a patient-care technician.

28:48.447 --> 28:50.413
Is that like a nurse?

28:50.415 --> 28:53.216
More like a physician's
assistant, but unlicensed.

28:53.218 --> 28:56.486
Could be a good route.
There is required training.

28:56.488 --> 29:00.423
How long is that? I-I-I want to
be working as soon as possible.

29:00.425 --> 29:02.225
It's a nine-month course.

29:02.227 --> 29:05.161
I need to be making money.

29:05.163 --> 29:06.963
Well, you need something right now,

29:06.965 --> 29:09.599
try some of the local sit-down
restaurants we have around here,

29:09.601 --> 29:11.901
if you... you know, if you're
willing to do food service...

29:11.903 --> 29:14.037
Or some of the fast-food establishments.

29:14.039 --> 29:15.672
How much do those pay?

29:15.674 --> 29:17.807
Minimum wage, around $7.50 an hour.

29:17.809 --> 29:19.442
My sister's making minimum.

29:19.444 --> 29:21.778
We need two incomes, good incomes.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.413
Well, you work one of those jobs,

29:23.415 --> 29:26.716
sign up for one of our
courses, and time will fly.

29:26.718 --> 29:29.019
How much do the courses cost?

29:29.021 --> 29:31.154
Um, there's a range of
financial-aid options

29:31.156 --> 29:32.622
we can help you with.

29:32.624 --> 29:34.124
But about how much?

29:34.126 --> 29:36.226
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.

29:50.075 --> 29:51.908
May I keep this?

29:51.910 --> 29:53.610
Absolutely.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:48.729 --> 30:51.663
I told Helen that it's your fault

30:51.665 --> 30:54.433
that we weren't able to have a baby.

30:54.435 --> 30:57.503
That's a lie.

30:57.505 --> 30:58.637
No, it's not.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.739
- It wasn't the only reason.
- It's the truth.

31:00.741 --> 31:02.841
How many doctors did you have to go see?

31:02.843 --> 31:04.443
- How... How many specialists?
- You couldn't do it.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.611
I had to use another man's sperm...

31:05.613 --> 31:06.645
We... We tried everything.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.413
And that's why you hate Nicky.

31:08.415 --> 31:10.482
You couldn't get me pregnant.

31:10.484 --> 31:12.738
The one thing a man is
supposed to be able to do,

31:12.741 --> 31:13.852
you couldn't do it.

32:17.084 --> 32:19.824
Girls get home okay?

32:19.827 --> 32:21.293
Yes.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.355
You know, I can get them.

32:23.357 --> 32:26.291
They can get by on their own.

32:26.293 --> 32:28.727
Besides, I don't want
them getting used to

32:28.729 --> 32:30.195
something that's just temporary.

32:31.365 --> 32:32.998
I'm not gonna be a burden to you.

32:34.134 --> 32:35.300
Didn't say you were.

32:35.302 --> 32:37.903
Well, I went down to the
Carolina Career Center

32:37.905 --> 32:39.204
looking for work.

32:39.206 --> 32:41.506
And?

32:41.508 --> 32:43.642
And they didn't have anything,

32:43.644 --> 32:45.777
nothing that pays anything right away.

32:45.779 --> 32:51.817
Told me to take some courses
and look into food-service work.

32:51.819 --> 32:53.619
Keep looking. You'll find something.

32:53.621 --> 32:55.087
Well, something I want?

32:55.089 --> 32:57.856
There's nothing out there
that pays a living wage.

32:57.858 --> 32:59.451
Where you been?

32:59.454 --> 33:01.293
Or you think I don't get paid nothing

33:01.295 --> 33:03.262
'cause I like not getting paid nothing?

33:03.264 --> 33:05.764
I thought things might
be different for you.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.100
Different 'cause...

33:10.337 --> 33:13.138
Of your situation.

33:13.140 --> 33:17.042
Since I got a conviction?
That what you mean?

33:17.044 --> 33:20.979
I know there are some things
that are more difficult for you.

33:20.981 --> 33:23.715
You know why minimum wage
is so low around here?

33:23.717 --> 33:27.953
They buried stuff about it in
that transgender bathroom bill.

33:27.955 --> 33:31.056
Even if somebody wanted
to pay more, they can't.

33:31.058 --> 33:32.124
They made people scared

33:32.126 --> 33:34.726
and got them to vote against themselves.

33:34.728 --> 33:37.029
Things are hard 'cause
some people are stupid.

33:42.202 --> 33:45.470
So...

33:45.472 --> 33:48.907
since I got to lie to your
husband and all that...

33:48.909 --> 33:52.511
can you just explain to me

33:52.513 --> 33:57.416
what this episode of yours is all about?

33:57.418 --> 33:59.618
It's not an episode.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.888
This isn't a... a thing.

34:02.890 --> 34:07.292
It's... It's about...

34:07.294 --> 34:09.928
my life.

34:09.929 --> 34:15.167
It's about my whole life.

34:15.168 --> 34:17.936
Haven't you ever felt overwhelmed?

34:17.938 --> 34:21.672
I got the girls.

34:21.675 --> 34:25.043
I can't afford to be overwhelmed.

36:14.059 --> 36:16.626
And it's like, "What's happening?"

36:16.628 --> 36:18.428
It's so bad.

37:46.551 --> 37:48.485
What are you doing?

37:48.487 --> 37:49.786
Hey. I was just...

37:49.788 --> 37:51.621
- What are you doing?
- I was just looking for...

37:51.623 --> 37:53.556
I told y'all to quit pulling this...

37:53.558 --> 37:56.659
I'm not. Y'all keep coming in
here and snatching my stuff.

37:56.661 --> 37:57.994
You need to relax.

37:57.996 --> 37:59.596
What?

37:59.598 --> 38:01.097
What did you just say?

38:01.099 --> 38:02.098
Move!

38:02.100 --> 38:03.967
You bitch!

38:03.969 --> 38:06.903
Bitch!

38:06.905 --> 38:11.975
You better get out, bitch.
I told you about that.

38:11.977 --> 38:15.245
I told you to mind your own!

38:15.247 --> 38:17.380
You bitch!

38:44.109 --> 38:45.241
What the hell?

38:45.243 --> 38:46.743
She was in my stuff.

38:46.745 --> 38:50.346
What the... What the
hell's wrong with you?

38:50.348 --> 38:51.814
My God. Hang on.

38:51.816 --> 38:53.783
Hang on, Shae.

38:53.785 --> 38:55.585
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

38:55.587 --> 38:57.554
What are you doing?

38:57.556 --> 38:59.022
What did you do?!

38:59.024 --> 39:00.323
What did you do?!

39:00.325 --> 39:01.791
Get Everett.

39:01.793 --> 39:03.092
Go get Everett!

39:04.563 --> 39:06.529
Shae.

39:06.531 --> 39:09.452
Shae, Shae.

39:09.455 --> 39:10.900
She... She was...

39:10.902 --> 39:12.035
What happened?

39:12.037 --> 39:13.503
- Shae?
- She was in my stuff!

39:13.505 --> 39:14.804
I didn't mean it! I swear it was an...

39:14.806 --> 39:17.574
- Shae?
- It was an accident. It was...

39:17.576 --> 39:20.677
Go to your room and wait. Go hang out.

39:20.679 --> 39:23.504
- Shae.
- Hey, give me your phone.

39:23.507 --> 39:25.415
Shut off the Wi-Fi.
Get them out of here.

39:25.417 --> 39:27.183
Let's go. Come on. Give me your phones.

39:27.185 --> 39:29.986
- Come here.
- Girls, to go your rooms.

39:29.988 --> 39:32.622
Don't look at that.
Look at me. Come here.

39:32.624 --> 39:34.557
Tell me about her.

39:34.559 --> 39:37.327
She have anybody, any family?

39:37.329 --> 39:38.795
I don't think so.

39:38.797 --> 39:40.597
She got a guy or anything?

39:40.599 --> 39:42.232
- Billy.
- Who's Billy?

39:42.234 --> 39:43.700
Was her pimp.

39:43.702 --> 39:44.968
Where is he at?

39:44.970 --> 39:46.469
In jail.

39:49.107 --> 39:51.341
Look, there's nothing you
can do for her. Hear me?

39:51.344 --> 39:52.742
There's nothing you can do

39:52.744 --> 39:55.378
except get everybody
in this house screwed.

39:55.380 --> 39:57.347
Tracy's screwed. You understand that?

39:57.349 --> 40:01.150
Jeremy's screwed. You're screwed.

40:01.152 --> 40:03.953
I didn't do anything.

40:05.957 --> 40:09.003
Are you stupid?

40:09.006 --> 40:10.672
Are you stupid?

40:14.933 --> 40:17.734
It's not gonna be a problem.

40:17.736 --> 40:20.703
She's got nobody but her pimp in jail.

40:22.474 --> 40:25.308
We can handle this.

40:25.310 --> 40:29.712
I'm gonna take care
of you, same as always.

40:29.714 --> 40:32.649
But there's some stuff you
got to take care of, too.
