01:11.423 --> 01:13.091
- Tommy did it again.
- What?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.094
He makes me look at the ceiling,
but there's nothing there.

01:17.972 --> 01:19.640
And then he gives me that look.

01:19.848 --> 01:21.725
- What look?
- That look.

01:22.851 --> 01:25.061
Oh, sure, now he's acting all innocent.

01:29.399 --> 01:32.402
- Stephanie, you're crazy.
- It's exactly what he wants you to think.

01:40.118 --> 01:42.329
- Morning, best friend.
- Hi.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.289
Good morning, sister-wife.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.293
I want a sister-wife divorce.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.255
Don't fight it. It's your destiny
to spend your life with me.

01:56.301 --> 02:00.014
I'm making the boys a healthy lunch.
Want me to make Ramona a turkey wrap?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.599
Oh, thanks, but Ramona loves my cooking.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.569
Seriously? $20?
You know, lunch costs, like, $4.

02:14.778 --> 02:18.448
I know, but I feel so guilty
about making her change schools.

02:19.199 --> 02:20.993
I'm gonna give her a little dessert.

02:24.204 --> 02:27.415
I'm not sure bribing your kid
is the best approach to parenting.

02:27.624 --> 02:29.918
But she likes me so much more when I do.

02:32.212 --> 02:35.799
He's trying to make me look again.
I am not looking up.

02:35.883 --> 02:37.759
And now I'm looking up.

02:38.927 --> 02:41.304
And, big surprise,
there's nothing up there.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.224
You sneaky little...

02:45.392 --> 02:48.269
Aw... Look at those chubby cheeks!

02:49.187 --> 02:50.355
What is it?

02:53.441 --> 02:57.612
I'm exhausted. I was up all night
erupting my volcano.

03:03.994 --> 03:06.705
Whoa, dude, TMI.

03:08.832 --> 03:11.877
Mom, please don't make me go
to this new school.

03:12.086 --> 03:13.837
I'm so lonely there.

03:13.921 --> 03:17.465
It's worse than the time you left me
at the ball pit in McDonald's.

03:18.133 --> 03:21.053
I didn't leave you. I forgot you.

03:23.055 --> 03:24.765
Do I have to go to this new school?

03:24.848 --> 03:28.184
I've been there five whole days
and I haven't made a single friend.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.396
Something's wrong with that place.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.566
According to every online
personality quiz I've ever taken,

03:34.649 --> 03:37.819
I score between "likeable"
and "very likeable".

03:38.737 --> 03:43.075
Well, you have at least one friend there,
Jackson. You guys are friends, right?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.702
Eh...

03:47.746 --> 03:50.999
Kimmy, I have to get to work.
You've got Tommy today.

03:51.207 --> 03:53.752
Sorry.
Gibbler Style has got a big party to plan.

03:53.961 --> 03:56.130
My client's turning 100 years old.

03:56.212 --> 03:58.924
I suggested we do his party
as soon as possible.

04:00.467 --> 04:02.677
Stephanie, you have no life.

04:04.805 --> 04:06.222
Can you watch Tommy today?

04:06.431 --> 04:07.808
I resent that.

04:07.891 --> 04:11.895
Just because I don't have a boyfriend or
a job or any money doesn't mean that I...

04:11.979 --> 04:15.231
Okay. Yeah, you know.
I'll watch him.

04:16.649 --> 04:18.944
It's Puppy Day! It's Puppy Day!

04:19.153 --> 04:20.570
Whoa, Max, take it easy!

04:20.779 --> 04:24.449
No take it easy! Take it crazy!

04:25.993 --> 04:28.328
Why are you dressed like a boy preacher?

04:29.537 --> 04:32.707
I'm gonna pick out one
of Comet Junior Junior's new puppies.

04:32.791 --> 04:34.918
Plus, I like looking snazzy.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.758
- I'll catch up with you guys later.
- Catch you in class.

04:43.677 --> 04:45.553
Hi, Ramona. What's up?

04:45.762 --> 04:48.515
I'm fake-texting,
so I don't look like a loser.

04:50.017 --> 04:53.353
Here comes this girl I kinda like.
You should say hi to her.

04:54.188 --> 04:55.355
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:55.438 --> 04:57.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:00.527 --> 05:03.113
You know, I thought that went really well.

05:04.156 --> 05:05.824
She barely acknowledged us.

05:05.907 --> 05:08.869
I wanna hang out with my real friends
at my real school.

05:09.703 --> 05:10.912
I gotta get out of here.

05:11.872 --> 05:14.708
I can make that happen.
I'll bust you right out of here.

05:14.916 --> 05:17.752
Really? That would be awesome!

05:17.836 --> 05:20.005
But this place is like Alcatraz.

05:21.631 --> 05:25.886
- How are you gonna get me out?
- Don't let this pretty face fool you.

05:27.054 --> 05:28.429
I'm bad to the bone.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.557
Ow!

05:32.017 --> 05:34.895
You're not even bad to the funny bone.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.610
- Morning, Janet.
- Morning, Dr. Fuller.

05:42.819 --> 05:44.946
Looking snazzy, Maxwell!

05:46.281 --> 05:48.075
That was my plan!

05:49.243 --> 05:51.578
I'd love to chat, but it's puppy time.

05:53.413 --> 05:54.581
Oh, wait.

06:00.170 --> 06:02.589
What dog could resist a baloney cologne?

06:07.385 --> 06:11.223
Holy chalupas! They're adorable!

06:12.266 --> 06:14.768
Okay, I have to get you to school,
so pick one.

06:14.976 --> 06:16.686
Hello, puppies. I'm Max.

06:16.770 --> 06:20.315
I'm into oceanography,
watermelon Jolly Ranchers,

06:20.398 --> 06:24.903
and lucky for you,
I drop a lot of food at the dinner table.

06:27.239 --> 06:30.242
Oh, I love that new puppy smell!

06:35.413 --> 06:38.166
Well... everything checked out.

06:38.374 --> 06:40.501
But his cholesterol's a little high.

06:41.795 --> 06:43.463
Get it? 'Cause he's bacon.

06:46.216 --> 06:49.636
Come on, Dad.
You don't wanna miss your plane.

06:51.263 --> 06:52.472
Oh...

06:52.555 --> 06:54.766
Hi. You must be Dr. Fuller?

06:55.433 --> 06:57.936
You're little Matty?

06:58.853 --> 07:00.521
Oh, you've improved.

07:02.149 --> 07:05.986
Thank you. The braces came off and
my head finally caught up with my ears.

07:06.861 --> 07:10.157
They were floppy. I thought
about trimming them like a Doberman.

07:10.365 --> 07:12.117
I do love to have my belly scratched.

07:15.536 --> 07:19.082
- You two are gonna love working together.
- Oh, we are?

07:19.291 --> 07:22.460
Yeah, Matt's gonna help out
while I'm on vacation. I told you.

07:22.669 --> 07:24.712
Uh... no, you didn't.

07:24.921 --> 07:27.590
I didn't? I know I told somebody.

07:27.674 --> 07:29.884
You told me, Dad. That's why I'm here.

07:32.595 --> 07:36.808
I look forward to working with you.
Maybe I'll let you scratch my belly.

07:40.436 --> 07:42.397
That was supposed to sound cute.

07:43.523 --> 07:45.942
Little cute, little weird.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.373
Max, did you pick one?
I have to get you to school.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.377
Dr. Fuller, I'm sorry,
but I have to go take my dog to the vet.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.463
Why don't you just bring him here?

08:07.672 --> 08:10.675
I can't afford your prices.

08:10.884 --> 08:13.511
Janet, I would give you
an employee discount.

08:14.179 --> 08:16.139
What kind of person do you think I am?

08:16.223 --> 08:19.851
I would never take my dog
to a discount veterinarian!

08:24.189 --> 08:26.358
I'm not a chew toy!

08:35.409 --> 08:37.077
- Cute baby.
- Thanks.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.663
- He look more like you or your husband?
- I'm not married.

08:43.666 --> 08:45.168
I'm Darren.

08:46.836 --> 08:51.174
Nothing sexier than a multi-tasking
single mom, leaning in and doing it all.

08:51.383 --> 08:55.929
Yeah, well, that's me, you know.
Stephanie, the sexy single mom.

08:57.055 --> 09:01.517
And this is Tommy, the baby that
I carried in my stomach for... what is it?

09:01.601 --> 09:03.644
Nine... yes, nine months. Yes.

09:05.188 --> 09:07.857
Yeah, hi, can I get
a double-chocolate fudge muffin

09:07.941 --> 09:12.779
and a bear claw,
a non-fat, no-whip skinny latte?

09:12.987 --> 09:14.906
Alright, that'll be $18.50.

09:16.074 --> 09:21.704
Okay, let's see. Start with the blue one
and work your way through the rainbow.

09:26.209 --> 09:28.169
- Hey, Deej.
<i>- Hey, I need a favor.</i>

09:28.378 --> 09:31.714
My receptionist flaked on me.
Can you come help out? I'll pay you.

09:31.923 --> 09:33.841
I'm kinda busy.

09:34.050 --> 09:37.053
Seven cards later
and you're still $4 short.

09:39.639 --> 09:40.848
I'll be right there.

09:42.642 --> 09:46.187
I'm working at Harmon Pet Care around
the corner. Maybe I could pay later?

09:46.396 --> 09:48.440
No, you may not.

09:49.316 --> 09:51.901
You made the right decision.
I wasn't coming back.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.656
- Well, bye, Darren.
- Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Tommy.

09:58.241 --> 10:00.118
Why's he always looking at the ceiling?

10:00.327 --> 10:03.204
Right?! Finally! Thank you!

10:10.170 --> 10:13.881
So, am I going through the air ducts?
Am I tunneling out? What's the plan?

10:14.090 --> 10:18.386
Listen to me very carefully.
When I say "go," you climb out the window.

10:20.638 --> 10:22.349
That's it?

10:22.557 --> 10:25.310
The blinds are pre-raised,
the window is pre-opened.

10:25.393 --> 10:27.687
When I execute my diversion, it's go time.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.149
But basically I'm just climbing
out the window?

10:32.025 --> 10:33.609
Uh... yeah.

10:35.195 --> 10:36.654
Good morning, class.

10:39.366 --> 10:42.702
I can feel your enthusiasm.

10:42.785 --> 10:45.330
Lola, tell us about your science project.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.832
That would be my pleasure, Mr. Gerald.

10:49.584 --> 10:54.339
This is a scale model
of the Haleakala volcano, which my mom...

10:54.422 --> 10:59.344
I mean, I... worked on all night.

10:59.553 --> 11:02.305
It's in Hawaii, which is where my mom...

11:02.389 --> 11:06.100
I mean, I went on my honeymoon.

11:10.688 --> 11:12.440
Six drops of that.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.252
Remain calm!

11:33.336 --> 11:35.547
But as you're fleeing for your lives,

11:35.755 --> 11:40.801
please take notice of how your projects
are reacting to the presence of H20!

11:41.969 --> 11:44.097
Careful, careful. Careful.

11:44.305 --> 11:45.432
Hey!

11:45.640 --> 11:50.645
You are in big trouble, Mr. Fuller! I saw
you set off that smoke alarm on purpose!

11:50.853 --> 11:54.690
It was an accident! I was practicing
chemical reactions, like you taught us!

11:55.358 --> 11:56.401
Whoa!

11:56.610 --> 12:00.321
Look who just got busted! The new kid!

12:00.530 --> 12:02.365
Great escape plan, Jackson.

12:02.449 --> 12:05.701
Except you forgot where everyone lines up
during a fire drill.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.205
Right outside this window.

12:10.498 --> 12:12.708
I'm sorry, do I know you?

12:16.963 --> 12:20.550
I can't decide.
I need volunteers to drop out.

12:22.885 --> 12:26.764
Just so you know,
we don't have a swimming pool,

12:26.847 --> 12:28.642
there's lots of stairs,

12:28.724 --> 12:31.269
and we're not allowed
to watch <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

12:31.352 --> 12:33.062
Whatever that is.

12:33.146 --> 12:37.775
If anybody wants out, raise your paw now.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.698
- Help is here!
- Oh, good. Hi, Tommy, honey.

12:43.781 --> 12:45.700
Mommy missed you.

12:45.908 --> 12:47.868
Good news, Kimmy's coming to get you.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.120
When do I get paid?

12:51.372 --> 12:53.416
When you do something.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.042
Prepare to be wowed.

12:55.543 --> 12:59.631
Uh, the rest of you
prepare to be bow-wowed. And, well...

13:00.047 --> 13:01.882
You prepare to be me-wowed.

13:05.178 --> 13:07.054
Hey, guys. I gotta grab Tommy and run.

13:07.263 --> 13:09.140
I'm triple-parked
and I got a tub of mayonnaise,

13:09.265 --> 13:12.686
three-dozen oysters
and a robot costume in the back seat.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.355
Is that for the birthday party
you're planning?

13:15.563 --> 13:16.731
No.

13:23.988 --> 13:26.449
Hello? What?

13:26.866 --> 13:28.075
You're kidding?

13:28.284 --> 13:29.703
I'll be right down.

13:30.953 --> 13:33.998
Jackson set off the fire alarm at school.
He's been suspended.

13:37.502 --> 13:40.254
Gibbler Style, party-planning perfection.

13:41.548 --> 13:43.591
What? Okay.

13:44.592 --> 13:48.304
Ramona got caught sneaking out of school.
She was suspended, too.

13:48.388 --> 13:51.224
That's so weird
that both of our kids are in trouble.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.522
On the bright side, at least
they're finally doing stuff together.

13:57.605 --> 14:00.149
Okay, Steph, you're in charge.

14:01.651 --> 14:04.487
Tommy, keep an eye on her.

14:09.992 --> 14:12.953
- Hey, Stephanie.
- Darren, hi.

14:13.037 --> 14:16.499
Hi. I brought you your coffee,
muffin and bear claw.

14:17.250 --> 14:20.294
Aw, wow. Thank you. That is so sweet.

14:20.378 --> 14:23.464
I... I feel like
I should give you something.

14:23.548 --> 14:26.300
Ah, like here. Heartworm medication.

14:28.469 --> 14:31.431
I am trying to worm my way
into your heart.

14:34.016 --> 14:36.728
This one's out of the running. Sorry, pal.

14:36.811 --> 14:38.979
Aw, look at that face!

14:39.063 --> 14:40.981
Okay, you're back in.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.069
Is this little guy yours, too?

14:45.152 --> 14:47.863
It depends.
How do you feel about moms with two kids?

14:48.072 --> 14:52.159
- Even sexier than moms with one kid.
- Good because he's mine.

14:53.494 --> 14:57.206
Alright, now go pick out your puppy
and give your mommy a kiss.

14:57.290 --> 15:00.334
- But you're not...
- Leaving this room without a puppy.

15:00.543 --> 15:03.504
Okay, and you can go play
with your brother right in there.

15:03.588 --> 15:05.089
Okay, perfect.

15:07.759 --> 15:11.053
- Now, where were we?
- We were about to ask you to dinner.

15:11.262 --> 15:15.683
Well, let me pretend to check my calendar.
Oh, look, I'm free!

15:17.351 --> 15:19.228
The best licker wins!

15:21.063 --> 15:22.690
We have a winner!

15:24.942 --> 15:29.614
And if for any reason the winner
cannot perform his doggie duties,

15:29.823 --> 15:33.200
you... will be contacted.

15:35.453 --> 15:37.872
I said "doggie duties!"

15:43.127 --> 15:45.672
My aunt found a stray pet.
Can you take care of it?

15:45.880 --> 15:48.215
Yeah, we're a pet clinic.
All pets are welcome.

15:50.343 --> 15:51.678
Except for skunks!

15:57.350 --> 16:00.019
Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:00.227 --> 16:02.396
- Skunk!
- Oh, Max, no!

16:06.567 --> 16:08.152
Hello? Steph...

16:11.280 --> 16:12.323
Uh-oh!

16:14.158 --> 16:15.368
Stephanie?

16:15.451 --> 16:18.287
Don't come in here.
I'm wrapping a present for you.

16:21.582 --> 16:24.585
Oh, my lanta!

16:31.300 --> 16:32.719
What's going on?

16:33.386 --> 16:37.640
More importantly, why did you come in here
when I said I was wrapping a present?

16:37.724 --> 16:39.559
You could have ruined the surprise.

16:41.728 --> 16:43.020
How did this happen?

16:43.229 --> 16:45.648
We were victims of a drive-by skunking!

16:49.318 --> 16:53.113
Google said tomato soup
would get the smell out. Are you mad?

16:53.865 --> 16:58.745
No. This is gonna look hilarious
on my Facebook page.

16:58.828 --> 17:00.413
Say cheese!

17:09.672 --> 17:12.299
- Hey, kids.
- Hey, Mom. This is my new friend, Lola.

17:12.508 --> 17:14.050
Nice to meet you, Lola.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.345
Your daughter's so cool.

17:16.429 --> 17:21.058
Security guards walked her to the
principal in front of the whole school.

17:23.018 --> 17:24.854
I couldn't be prouder.

17:27.064 --> 17:28.232
Hey, Lola.

17:30.526 --> 17:32.987
You're the kid that ruined my volcano.

17:33.070 --> 17:35.114
Now my mom has to make a whole new one.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.452
I'll see you in school in three days.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.203
You'll sit at our lunch table.

17:41.287 --> 17:44.582
We sit right next to the future
millionaires of Silicon Valley.

17:46.333 --> 17:50.504
We used to call them geeks, but
that was before the self-esteem assembly.

17:51.798 --> 17:52.799
Hugs!

17:54.300 --> 17:55.718
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:57.845 --> 18:00.765
Can you believe it, Mom?
I actually made some friends.

18:00.848 --> 18:03.142
And I'm out of school
for the next three days!

18:04.351 --> 18:06.687
See, I told you things would get better!

18:10.232 --> 18:11.609
Didn't I say no video games?

18:11.818 --> 18:15.112
I just needed something to do
while waiting for my punishment.

18:18.616 --> 18:19.909
Well, the wait is over.

18:20.117 --> 18:22.912
Here's a list of chores you'll be doing
while you're suspended.

18:22.996 --> 18:27.834
"Mow the lawn, rake the leaves,
sync your mother's iPhone to her iPad."

18:29.209 --> 18:31.295
I can never figure out how to do that.

18:33.506 --> 18:35.675
We need to talk about your punishment.

18:35.758 --> 18:40.095
How about if I take you to your old school
and you can say hi to your old friends?

18:41.722 --> 18:43.474
That sounds fair.

18:44.725 --> 18:46.811
On the way home, can we get mani-pedis?

18:47.020 --> 18:51.732
No. We'll get them on the way there, so
your friends can see your gorgeous nails.

18:56.029 --> 18:57.822
Mom, are you watching this?

18:58.031 --> 19:00.741
- This is so unfair!
- It is.

19:01.659 --> 19:06.080
You don't...
reward bad behavior with a spa day.

19:06.288 --> 19:08.332
Ramona can think about what she did wrong

19:08.415 --> 19:10.918
while the manicurist
pushes back her cuticles.

19:12.294 --> 19:16.173
- That can really hurt.
- Come with me.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.385
Drop it, Jackson.

19:21.554 --> 19:25.058
I don't wanna fight in front of the kids,
but I do wanna fight.

19:26.684 --> 19:30.396
Because your bad parenting
is undermining my good parenting.

19:31.522 --> 19:33.774
You're just jealous
'cause my kid likes me.

19:35.192 --> 19:39.405
Kimmy, you're supposed to be their parent,
not their BFF.

19:39.488 --> 19:41.448
Jackson's upset and I don't blame him

19:41.532 --> 19:45.411
because Ramona is getting rewarded
for ditching school!

19:45.619 --> 19:47.038
I know.

19:47.830 --> 19:49.916
But I can't punish her now.

19:49.999 --> 19:53.586
She's been through so much,
between Fernando and me separating

19:53.669 --> 19:55.922
and leaving her home and changing schools.

19:56.672 --> 19:58.716
And all of it's my fault.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.846
I just want Ramona to be happy.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.350
But she will be happy.

20:08.434 --> 20:13.814
And she'll be happier with a parent
who sets rules and limits and boundaries.

20:15.149 --> 20:17.276
But what if she gets mad at me?

20:18.444 --> 20:20.738
She'll get over it.

20:20.821 --> 20:22.740
You can do this.

20:23.616 --> 20:27.578
And by the way, this finger...
it's 90% of parenting.

20:35.544 --> 20:38.131
My perfect, sweet, precious Ramona...

20:46.388 --> 20:48.432
I'm canceling spa day tomorrow.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.226
Instead, you're gonna help Jackson
with his chores.

20:52.186 --> 20:54.354
Ah, nice! Now we're talking!

20:55.731 --> 20:58.358
You can have 16 through 44.

21:00.778 --> 21:03.156
Mom, you can't be serious?

21:05.491 --> 21:07.118
I'm serious.

21:07.994 --> 21:12.123
I love you, but you need rules
and lemons and boundaries.

21:17.252 --> 21:20.173
Not "lemons," limits.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.382
Oh! That makes more sense.

21:24.635 --> 21:25.803
Thanks, D.J.

21:26.012 --> 21:29.556
Don't blame D.J.
It was my decision to punish you.

21:30.265 --> 21:31.892
After D.J. told me to.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.439
I think we can all agree
that both of you being punished is fair.

21:38.649 --> 21:40.651
If we're really being fair,

21:40.734 --> 21:45.114
you should know that Jackson
only set off the alarm to help me escape.

21:47.158 --> 21:48.492
Is that true, Jackson?

21:48.701 --> 21:52.705
Yeah. I felt bad for Ramona,
so I came to her rescue.

21:52.788 --> 21:56.500
Setting off a dangerous explosion
without any regard for my own safety.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.378
Or anyone else's.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.049
Like a true American hero.

22:03.757 --> 22:07.720
I salute your patriotism,
but you're still punished.

22:09.304 --> 22:11.015
But maybe a little less.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.478
So, you're not mad at me?

22:17.563 --> 22:20.649
I'm not thrilled with you, but...

22:21.901 --> 22:23.194
I get it.

22:24.278 --> 22:26.780
- Hugs?
- Come here, Mom.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.829
After you've done your time,
we'll go visit your old friends.

22:34.038 --> 22:35.873
Is that okay?

22:38.167 --> 22:42.963
Okay, everybody, I'd like to introduce
the newest member of the family,

22:43.172 --> 22:45.007
Cosmo T.D. Fuller.

22:45.091 --> 22:49.178
- "T.D." stands for "the dog".
- Hi, Cosmo.

22:50.345 --> 22:52.347
That's my date. Don't wait up.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.562
- Hi!
- Hey, Steph.

22:58.645 --> 23:01.023
- Everyone, this is Darren.
- Hey!

23:01.232 --> 23:02.816
More kids.

23:05.236 --> 23:09.156
Yeah... yeah.
That's Jackson and Ramona, the twins.

23:11.700 --> 23:15.495
You know Max. And of course
my housekeeper and my au pair.

23:20.459 --> 23:22.502
Kids, Mommy says homework and to bed.

23:22.586 --> 23:25.256
Au pair, have them brush their teeth
before bed

23:25.339 --> 23:28.259
and housekeeper,
just stay out of the liquor cabinet.

23:32.930 --> 23:35.808
- Bye, kids.
- Bye, Mommy.
