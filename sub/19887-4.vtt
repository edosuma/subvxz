00:30.879 --> 00:33.759
Hey! Hey!

00:46.920 --> 00:49.360
(Men chat in Polish)

01:06.079 --> 01:08.039
Come on.

01:20.759 --> 01:23.159
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:24.319 --> 01:26.959
- Got a mobile, mate?
- Got a signal?

01:27.560 --> 01:30.400
Lisa, Come on. It's
raining, quick. Come on.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.319
Come on. Quick now.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.159
Come with me.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.119
- Ma'am.
- Is it her?

02:53.159 --> 02:56.519
I've not had a look yet,
but definitely female.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.039
No, it'll be her.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.800
I mean, how far's mam and dad from here?

03:01.839 --> 03:04.479
About five miles that way.

03:04.519 --> 03:07.560
Liaison from Missing Persons
have got the family on standby.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.400
Dental records we already
had. Likewise DNA.

03:11.519 --> 03:14.200
Do we know what she was
wearing when she left home?

03:14.239 --> 03:15.720
Shorts and a vest top.

03:16.639 --> 03:18.800
Right. It was that weekend, wasn't it?

03:20.759 --> 03:24.319
Sweltering. I weeded the path.

03:25.759 --> 03:28.000
It's all grown back now, this weather.

03:29.519 --> 03:32.280
- Why is this worse?
- Because of the publicity.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.600
Feel like you know her.

03:35.639 --> 03:37.639
Less anonymous.

03:39.439 --> 03:41.479
Well, let's have a look.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.920
- Tony.
- OK.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.720
The shorts are right.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
The hair's right, and the age.

04:05.039 --> 04:07.159
What's that bangle thing on her wrist?

04:08.360 --> 04:10.360
Does it say "Eastbury"?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.839
- Yeah.
- That's the festival she went to.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.400
So, what? Killed on her way home?

04:19.879 --> 04:21.879
Well, buried deep enough.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.920
Not just dumped here, covered in earth.

04:25.959 --> 04:28.119
No, whoever did it put
some real effort into it.

04:28.159 --> 04:30.920
- Hm.
- (Raised voices outside)

04:31.920 --> 04:34.200
- Tha's the father.
- Is it her?

04:34.239 --> 04:36.079
- Mr Hinkin...
- Let me see!

04:36.119 --> 04:38.519
- I'll have to stop you there, sir.
- Is it Mia?

04:38.560 --> 04:41.079
We don't know, sir. I'm sorry.

04:41.119 --> 04:43.680
No, please... No, no!

04:43.720 --> 04:46.079
Let me look! It's Mia!

04:47.400 --> 04:48.839
Mia!

05:12.800 --> 05:14.920
Left at the stables.

05:30.879 --> 05:34.280
- Would you like a GP
to look you over, love?
- No, I'm all right!

05:37.079 --> 05:39.079
Here you go.

05:39.879 --> 05:41.839
Thank you.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.200
Look, I know how difficult
it's been since Mia...

05:57.239 --> 05:59.239
failed to return home.

06:00.159 --> 06:03.119
And I know you've been asked
a hundred times, but...

06:03.920 --> 06:08.239
.. I would like to try and start with
a clean slate. Is that all right?

06:10.200 --> 06:13.400
- Now, where this body was found...
- For God's sake.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.400
Stop treating us like we're stupid!

06:15.439 --> 06:17.360
Stop covering your back!

06:18.759 --> 06:20.600
I know it's her.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.680
I can just tell.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.439
Do you know who owns that land?

06:28.479 --> 06:32.600
No-one. It's common ground.
Our boundary's the copse.

06:32.639 --> 06:34.439
And so the pickers work for you?

06:34.959 --> 06:38.920
No. They work for him over the
way. Rents the land off us.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.159
So, going back six weeks, you
last saw your daughter...?

06:45.200 --> 06:48.000
- The Friday morning.
- On the day of the festival?

06:49.759 --> 06:51.759
And how did she seem?

06:53.439 --> 06:57.680
We didn't see her go. Came back
from the doctor's and she'd gone.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.319
I was supposed to drive her to
the bus station in town but...

07:03.560 --> 07:06.159
.. she rang to say she'd
make her own way there.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.039
And was that like her,
to change her plans?

07:10.920 --> 07:15.560
It was a bad feeling because we never
wanted her to go to the bloody thing.

07:16.759 --> 07:19.000
Did she tell you who she was going with?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.720
No, that was the problem.
She wouldn't tell us.

07:22.759 --> 07:25.200
Said it was no business of ours.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.639
But did you get the feeling
it was friends? Or boyfriends?

07:29.680 --> 07:33.000
No. Friends, I suppose.

07:34.119 --> 07:36.079
Her boyfriend's Owen. You know Owen?

07:36.119 --> 07:39.600
- We know of him.
- He's doing the Internet, you know?

07:39.639 --> 07:41.239
Looking for her.

07:42.159 --> 07:45.400
Fat lot of good it did. Fat
lot of good any of it's done.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.280
Could I perhaps have a
look at her room, love?

08:06.759 --> 08:10.560
She liked it locked. Just trying
to have it like she wanted.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.360
- I'm sorry for the intrusion, love.
- Well, we're used to it now, aren't we?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
You know it's her, don't you?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.159
I cannot be in here.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.720
Did Missing Persons take
her computer or anything?

09:05.759 --> 09:07.759
They said she didn't have one.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.839
Reckon she just took a bag.

09:09.879 --> 09:11.959
I mean, does this look empty to you?

09:12.680 --> 09:15.280
I mean, does that mean
she didn't have anything?

09:15.319 --> 09:18.600
Or she took a load with
her to the festival?

09:18.639 --> 09:21.759
- I can ask.
- Well, maybe not just now.

09:27.079 --> 09:29.079
Nice view.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.920
Her dental's a positive
match. Definitely Mia.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
Well, that's that, then.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.000
Now for the really hard bit.

09:55.039 --> 09:57.920
Now, is that the younger
brother out there?

09:58.879 --> 10:01.079
Yeah. Yeah, that's Jason.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.079
Has he been told?

10:08.079 --> 10:10.079
Hello.

10:12.159 --> 10:14.800
Aw. What's her name?

10:14.839 --> 10:19.000
- She's not a pet.
- Ah, well, it looks like
you're fond of her.

10:19.039 --> 10:21.639
Nah. This one's my favourite.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.600
Ah.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.119
I like chickens.

10:26.839 --> 10:29.200
- Are you one of the police?
- Mm.

10:30.319 --> 10:32.439
You found my sister?

10:32.479 --> 10:35.560
Let's go and talk to your
mam and dad inside, love.

10:37.239 --> 10:39.239
Are you bringing her home?

10:40.079 --> 10:41.839
Come on, son.

10:53.479 --> 10:55.479
I think you should stay, love.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
Aye, right.

10:59.639 --> 11:01.639
Course.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.720
- Why do you think she's dead?
- She told you, the body.

11:06.759 --> 11:08.280
But how did they know?

11:09.239 --> 11:12.519
Maybe she's just... gone
somewhere. How did they know?

11:16.680 --> 11:18.639
I am so sorry, love.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.119
I don't understand.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.639
Get Hicham onto Social Services.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.639
I mean, when was the last
time that lad had a wash?

12:09.200 --> 12:12.519
- Sorry. Have you just
come from the Hinkins?
- Aye.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.560
Is that because those guys found Mia?

12:14.600 --> 12:17.400
We're not giving out that
information yet, sir.

12:17.439 --> 12:19.680
Only, cos... there's
a rumour on Twitter.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.759
Well, it's not come from us.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.039
Please. We're all neighbours here.

12:24.079 --> 12:27.479
We just want to offer condolences
to Mal and Nell, you know?

12:27.519 --> 12:30.159
My guys are offering to
lend a hand if they need it.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.639
I'd say now's not a good
time. Maybe in a day or two.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.920
That driver. Is he the fella
rents from the parents?

12:41.959 --> 12:45.439
- Must be, yeah.
- If he is, he's doing
all right for himself.

12:45.479 --> 12:46.800
His motor!

12:47.720 --> 12:52.680
And while we're looking at people in
the area, see if his workers are legit.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.560
What? What?

13:07.079 --> 13:08.720
Yeah, that's right.

13:15.079 --> 13:17.360
Hey, Kenny. You're a life-saver.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.119
Ha. What do you want
me to do with Uniform?

13:20.159 --> 13:24.439
Uniform? House to house. We're
looking for bus passengers.

13:24.479 --> 13:29.920
Anyone who saw our victim
travelling to or from Eastbury.

13:29.959 --> 13:34.479
Right. Well, I'm not sure how
a bunch of city slickers like us
are gonna get on with this lot.

13:34.519 --> 13:36.759
Aiden, do an appeal for information.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.879
Great! Bring out your cranks and
your weirdos, police are all ears.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.439
And we're gonna have
to do a public briefing.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.680
Right, now I'm looking for a boyfriend.

13:47.119 --> 13:47.800
Very funny.

13:47.839 --> 13:52.039
He's in there with his mum.
But there's a chance he beat
us to it on a public briefing.

13:52.079 --> 13:54.119
Right.

13:58.519 --> 14:01.239
- What do you need with him?
- Just background, love.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.239
I can tell you that. What do you need?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.400
No, I need to talk to him.

14:05.439 --> 14:07.079
Look, he's in no state.

14:07.839 --> 14:09.879
24/7 he's been on that phone.

14:11.119 --> 14:13.560
He were convinced that he'd find her.

14:14.639 --> 14:16.720
And now I don't know where to start.

14:16.759 --> 14:18.920
Well, first you can get
him off the Internet.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.319
There'll be all sorts
coming out the woodwork.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.360
It won't help.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.959
You did your best. Everything
you did to try and find her.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.200
- Well, that will help us.
- It wasn't the point, though, was it?

14:37.800 --> 14:42.439
But it's important we get
the next bit right, yeah?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.680
So can you take me back to
the last time you saw Mia?

14:49.600 --> 14:52.680
Before she went off, she came
in the bar to say goodbye.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.959
Before going to the festival?
So that's Friday night.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.200
- Why weren't you going with her?
- It's not really my kind of music.

15:00.239 --> 15:02.959
Well, she wasn't going
on her own, surely?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.959
Didn't say who she was going with.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.119
- Mm?
- She got the ticket at
the last minute, I think.

15:08.159 --> 15:10.680
We hadn't even talked about it.

15:12.239 --> 15:15.000
And how did she seem in herself?

15:15.039 --> 15:18.280
- How do you mean?
- Happy? Unhappy?

15:20.560 --> 15:24.280
We were happy. Home wasn't great.
They treated her like a skivvy.

15:25.239 --> 15:29.560
When you say "they"... What,
do you mean her parents?

15:30.680 --> 15:33.200
- You know her mam's ill?
- Mm.

15:33.239 --> 15:36.079
That meant she had to do
more than her fair share.

15:39.159 --> 15:45.800
Can you think of anyone, anyone at
all, who might have wanted to harm her?

15:46.720 --> 15:49.879
You know them pickers?
Off Jack Madden's farm?

15:49.920 --> 15:51.360
- Right.
- Yeah.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.600
They're always hanging around,
creeping the women out.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.959
And Mia was friendly with them, was she?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.159
No. They're not our type of people.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.560
But I think it was them.

16:19.920 --> 16:24.239
Passports. Need photocopies
of your passports, ASAP.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.239
The police are here and
they're asking questions.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.920
- They found Mia Hinkin.
- Where has she gone?

16:29.959 --> 16:31.959
Nowhere. She's dead.

17:12.039 --> 17:14.319
Do you want to see these photos?

17:14.360 --> 17:16.360
Aye, I do.

17:25.119 --> 17:29.119
- Do you need me to talk you through it?
- They're pretty self-explanatory.

17:29.159 --> 17:30.839
Strangled.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.519
Now, what sort of ligature? I mean,
this wasn't hands done this, was it?

17:35.560 --> 17:38.879
No. We found some fibres but,
as yet, that's a "don't know".

17:38.920 --> 17:40.680
Could a woman have done it?

17:40.720 --> 17:44.600
Well, there was some kind
of a struggle, but it didn't
come off the back of a fight.

17:44.639 --> 17:47.560
Upside, there's some material
under the fingernails

17:47.600 --> 17:49.200
which might yield some DNA.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.639
Oh, well, that's good.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.439
And there's no sign of a sexual assault?

17:54.479 --> 17:56.400
I'd say no. Not from what I've seen.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.680
So, impulsive rather than planned?

17:59.720 --> 18:01.159
Yeah, I think so.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.319
And the million-dollar question... When?

18:05.360 --> 18:08.239
Well, I need to confer with
my mate who's a meteorologist

18:08.280 --> 18:11.839
and get some accurate temperature
data for the last six weeks.

18:11.879 --> 18:15.920
- Bit of a microclimate up here.
- So it happened somewhere nearby.

18:15.959 --> 18:19.479
- I'd say so.
- Hm.

18:19.519 --> 18:22.800
Mia Hinkin. 18 years of age.

18:22.839 --> 18:26.839
She lived and worked with mum and dad on
a dairy farm just outside of Brindale.

18:26.879 --> 18:32.360
Failed to return home from
Eastbury Festival some time
after the 2nd of last month.

18:32.400 --> 18:37.479
Now, the body was found five
miles from said dairy farm,

18:37.519 --> 18:40.239
40 days after she left the village.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.280
She'd been strangled.

18:42.319 --> 18:46.920
Primary line of inquiry is to establish
what time she departed the festival,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.920
who she met there, and who,
if anyone, she went with.

18:49.959 --> 18:54.319
Now, Hicham, have you got the
CCTV from the bus station yet?

18:54.360 --> 18:57.000
We're trawling, but neither
us nor Missing Persons

18:57.039 --> 18:58.800
found her on any bus coming or going.

18:58.839 --> 19:02.119
And do we know who she was
going to see, music-wise?

19:02.159 --> 19:04.439
- Party Crusade.
- Who?

19:04.479 --> 19:07.239
Party Crusade. They're the
ones that put up the reward.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.759
She's been a fan since last
summer, according to this.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.360
And who are these two lasses?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.119
Er, she's the guitar player.

19:18.159 --> 19:20.479
She's not tagged. I mean,
she could be a random.

19:20.519 --> 19:23.920
So, she checked in at the
festival 8pm Friday 2nd.

19:23.959 --> 19:25.560
No activity online thereafter.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.600
So, does that suggest something
happened there round about that time?

19:30.560 --> 19:33.600
- Or she just lost her mobile?
- We haven't found one.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.600
Parents said she didn't have a contract,
so we're looking for a pay-as-you-go.

19:37.639 --> 19:40.200
It's taking time. Got a number, no SIM.

19:40.239 --> 19:43.159
OK, second line of inquiry,

19:43.200 --> 19:47.879
bearing in mind the
location of the crime scene,

19:47.920 --> 19:50.360
is her relationships in the village.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.319
Now, if the killer brought her back,
or intercepted her on her way home,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.200
and who might have had motive.

19:56.239 --> 19:59.720
We're picking up local suspicion
of the seasonal workforce.

19:59.759 --> 20:02.039
Is there any suggestion
of a connection there?

20:02.079 --> 20:03.879
- Hicham?
- The only link springs out

20:03.920 --> 20:06.639
is that three of the workers
confirmed to Missing Persons

20:06.680 --> 20:09.039
she'd been in the pub before
she left for Eastbury.

20:09.079 --> 20:12.119
That was her last known contact
with the village, wasn't it?

20:12.159 --> 20:14.319
I'll push them on their
whereabouts after that.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.519
We're picking up tensions
within the family.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.879
Mum's unwell. Younger son,
query neglect. Yeah, I've
alerted Social Services.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.920
So some suggestion that
Mia was unhappy at home.

20:24.959 --> 20:28.759
In other words, a
vulnerable young woman.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.959
Not the raver partying every
weekend, as the publicity suggests.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.600
So, who exploited that vulnerability?
Who made sure she never came home?

20:53.639 --> 20:56.680
- I was just about to bring it up.
- Ah, that's OK.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.439
- PC Wooten, isn't it?
- George.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.360
Statements from the festival-goers.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.319
Obviously, it's all on the system but
I thought, as I'd already printed it...

21:07.360 --> 21:09.680
Well, thanks, I appreciate that.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.519
If I was cynical, I might say people
are chancing their arm for a reward.

21:15.439 --> 21:17.439
"Blonde girl in Wellingtons."

21:17.479 --> 21:20.000
"Blonde girl with a sun tattoo."

21:20.039 --> 21:22.159
"Blonde girl with red scarf."

21:23.000 --> 21:26.439
"Blonde girl in a cowboy
hat." I see what you mean.

21:26.479 --> 21:28.639
But erm... But there's...

21:29.639 --> 21:32.039
There's this lass, a first-aider.

21:32.079 --> 21:34.720
Reckoned she treated her.
She was helpful.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.519
I'll start with her, then.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.360
Now, what about the stuff
you took from her room?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.400
It's all there.

21:42.439 --> 21:44.560
That's it?

21:45.560 --> 21:48.000
Her room strike you as being empty?

21:48.039 --> 21:50.479
Struck me more they were
pretty broke as a family.

21:50.519 --> 21:52.560
- Hm.
- How's her mam and dad?

21:52.600 --> 21:54.879
As you'd expect.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.759
Will you pass on my condolences?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.879
Aye, course I will. Thanks, George.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.839
I did make her a top priority,
even though she was an adult.

22:02.879 --> 22:05.319
I did throw the kitchen sink at it.

22:15.879 --> 22:18.239
So, according to your statement,

22:18.280 --> 22:21.280
you were on duty at the
festival and you treated Mia.

22:21.319 --> 22:22.759
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.000
She said she'd taken a couple of pills.

22:25.959 --> 22:29.280
- What sort of pills?
- I don't ask. We're not meant to judge.

22:30.839 --> 22:34.000
Anyway, when I saw she was
missing, I felt I had to call.

22:34.039 --> 22:35.560
Yeah, well, thanks, love.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.360
Did you get the sense that
she was a regular drug-taker?

22:38.400 --> 22:42.119
I'd say so. She was quite
chilled about having a whitey.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.360
I know I should have supervised her.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.280
Did she pass out somewhere?

22:51.319 --> 22:53.239
Is it my fault?

22:55.039 --> 22:56.159
Mm...

22:56.200 --> 22:58.000
She was murdered, love.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.920
I didn't... realise.

23:03.159 --> 23:05.159
I'm so sorry.

23:07.879 --> 23:10.039
If I'd known, I would have...

23:10.879 --> 23:12.879
Would have what?

23:15.239 --> 23:17.119
It's probably nothing.

23:17.159 --> 23:19.759
I just didn't say this
with the other policeman.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.280
What?

23:21.319 --> 23:25.200
I saw her later, like, late
o'clock at the end of the night.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.239
Arguing with a bloke.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.920
- Should I have told you?
- Would you recognise this fella?

23:29.959 --> 23:34.039
I wasn't that close. But they were
definitely having a go at each other.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.479
Right, have a look at this.
Give us your Twitter thing.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.280
- Is that the fella?
- No. This guy was older.

23:46.319 --> 23:48.639
I think I've seen him
on the Missing Mia feed.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.039
Have you? Well, let's have a look.

23:53.519 --> 23:56.560
Stop. Maybe that guy, maybe.

23:58.119 --> 24:01.000
How sure are you -- on
a scale of one to ten?

24:01.039 --> 24:03.039
Seven.

24:07.519 --> 24:10.200
Well, thanks, Meryl.
You've been a great help.

24:13.159 --> 24:15.159
- And?
- Gary Tovey.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.720
According to the veg farm bloke,
his wife runs the stables.

24:18.759 --> 24:21.600
So why does he call himself
the Brindale Runner?

24:21.639 --> 24:24.439
- Why not just use his real name?
- Could be anything.

24:24.479 --> 24:26.479
Impress the ladies... Anything.

24:27.360 --> 24:31.079
Tovey Stables. That rings a bell.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.280
Isn't that near Hinkin's fields?

24:34.319 --> 24:36.439
Oh, yeah. We saw the horses.

24:36.479 --> 24:40.200
You know he's retweeted everything
we've posted in the last six weeks?

24:40.239 --> 24:42.280
What's that mean in layman's terms?

24:42.319 --> 24:45.839
Well, at the very least, he's
following our every move.

24:45.879 --> 24:48.920
Well, let's pay Mr Tovey a little visit.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.800
Come on, Ellie. That's it.

25:10.879 --> 25:12.079
Nice.

25:13.439 --> 25:14.560
Good.

25:14.639 --> 25:18.200
Excuse me, love. Looking for Gary Tovey?

25:19.200 --> 25:21.159
I'm Mrs Tovey. Can I help?

25:21.239 --> 25:24.759
Ah. Just a word with your husband, love.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.239
- He's out.
- When might he be back?

25:29.319 --> 25:32.119
Good question. When the
work's done, probably.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.639
Is it about this body?

25:33.720 --> 25:36.439
- Was it Mia?
- Yes, it was.

25:37.239 --> 25:39.239
So you both knew Mia, then?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.600
Yeah, absolutely. Erm...

25:41.680 --> 25:45.319
I mean... she'd been coming here since...

25:45.400 --> 25:48.360
Well, forever, really.
She'd been a Saturday girl.

25:48.439 --> 25:51.319
So she was working for you just
prior to her disappearance?

25:51.400 --> 25:53.159
On and off.

25:54.079 --> 25:56.079
More off than on.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.879
Let's go inside.

25:59.839 --> 26:04.759
She hadn't been herself the last few
months. She got really... teenage.

26:04.839 --> 26:08.560
- In what way "teenage"?
- Well, unreliable.

26:08.639 --> 26:10.879
Not always coming when she said.

26:10.959 --> 26:13.200
And sulking with me for no reason.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.280
So would you say her behaviour
recently was out of character?

26:18.360 --> 26:20.759
She just seemed more
desperate, poor thing.

26:20.839 --> 26:23.319
She was so fixated on
getting out of the village.

26:23.400 --> 26:28.360
She was a bit trapped, wasn't she?
No way of getting out off her own back.

26:28.439 --> 26:29.920
Parents never paid her a penny.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.879
Ah, but you did. So why is this
the first we've heard of it?

26:33.959 --> 26:37.400
Well, like I say. We kept
things on the QT cos of them.

26:37.479 --> 26:41.680
We didn't want to take sides,
but... we felt sorry for her.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.159
Wanderer returns. They're police.

26:51.119 --> 26:53.200
They want our help about Mia.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.680
Absolutely.

26:56.759 --> 26:59.759
No, can't say I'm much
of a party animal.

26:59.839 --> 27:02.439
I definitely didn't go
to any music festival.

27:03.479 --> 27:07.439
Can you remember anything about
that day? What you might have done?

27:07.519 --> 27:10.039
Nothing special, don't think.

27:10.119 --> 27:12.600
I'm boring. Either here or out running.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.759
Or down the pub with Jack.

27:14.839 --> 27:17.000
Yeah. Or down the pub with Jack.

27:17.959 --> 27:21.119
What about the evening, say after six?

27:21.200 --> 27:23.159
We were definitely in all evening.

27:23.239 --> 27:27.920
You remember. We talked about
how awful it'd be to be
sleeping in some muddy field.

27:28.600 --> 27:29.920
We did, yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.439
Were either of you ever
aware of Mia taking drugs?

27:34.519 --> 27:38.239
No. Is that what it was,
then? The change in her?

27:38.319 --> 27:40.079
That would explain it, wouldn't it?

27:40.159 --> 27:44.479
I mean, we've known her since
she was, what... 11, 12?

27:44.560 --> 27:48.239
And I've never seen her so
miserable as this past year.

27:50.079 --> 27:52.479
Why do you use a pseudonym
on the Internet?

27:54.479 --> 27:57.360
Same reason as anyone. Privacy.

28:03.839 --> 28:05.800
I was in the Army.

28:05.879 --> 28:09.720
You Google me, you'll find I was
in Helmand until the withdrawal.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.639
Certain people like to
take issue with that.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.839
Right.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.639
Bit of a contrast to life
round here, though, isn't it?

28:17.720 --> 28:20.720
Yeah. It's all peace and
tranquillity and no mistake.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.600
- Mum! Mum!
- Right on cue.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.200
All right, I'll go.

28:30.759 --> 28:33.560
- Where'd you find her?
- By Brindale mine.

28:33.639 --> 28:35.079
But we searched there.

28:35.159 --> 28:37.200
What do you mean? What search is this?

28:37.280 --> 28:40.039
The one Owen organised. We all did it.

28:40.119 --> 28:44.159
- Went all over.
- Owen? As in Owen Travers?
Mia's boyfriend?

28:44.239 --> 28:47.800
No, he weren't her boyfriend.
She'd called it off, hadn't she?

28:47.879 --> 28:49.600
What makes you say that?

28:49.680 --> 28:52.600
She told me. She told me
she'd got shot of him.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.319
Like I say, she wanted out.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.360
Aiden.

29:03.119 --> 29:05.400
Bunch of us went out through the fields.

29:06.319 --> 29:08.560
Well, you lot weren't
doing anything, were you?

29:08.639 --> 29:11.680
So, why did you think
she'd returned to the area?

29:11.759 --> 29:13.519
I don't know. I was desperate.

29:14.759 --> 29:17.119
So, were you still
together, you and Mia?

29:17.200 --> 29:19.239
- Does it matter?
- Aye, it does.

29:19.319 --> 29:22.720
Because I need to be clear on
her significant relationships.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.159
And will you stop doing that
while I'm talking to you?

29:26.239 --> 29:28.720
In my head, we were
still together, yeah.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.839
And in hers?

29:31.519 --> 29:33.800
She broke up with me
about a week before.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.119
People break up, then they get back
together. It happens all the time.

29:38.200 --> 29:41.119
And when they bury her, I'll
be up there, up the front.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.200
I won't be pushed out.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.360
Why are you making intimations at him?

29:47.439 --> 29:50.360
He doted on her. You can ask anyone.

29:52.759 --> 29:55.560
Look, she were a good girl.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.920
But she could be a madam
and she could play people.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.639
Made eyes at a lot of blokes.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.159
So, what are the
intimations you're making?

30:06.479 --> 30:10.759
Everyone knows she hated her mam and
dad and that they didn't much like her.

30:11.439 --> 30:13.879
You should be looking closer
to home, if you ask me.

30:13.959 --> 30:16.560
I don't think I did ask you, pet.

30:25.519 --> 30:28.239
Blame the pickers. Blame the parents.

30:28.319 --> 30:32.720
What if that barmaid's right and
Mia did hate her mam and dad?

30:34.519 --> 30:38.879
Totally miserable, according
to the Toveys. Wanted out
of the village, right?

30:38.959 --> 30:42.400
- And she was only seen
briefly at that festival.
- So...?

30:42.479 --> 30:46.439
So what if Eastbury was a
chance to buy herself some time?

30:46.519 --> 30:50.360
A chance to get out of that house
and not come back. New life.

30:50.439 --> 30:54.680
Ma'am. Witness saw Gary Tovey in
The Lion at lunchtime, day she left.

30:54.759 --> 30:58.959
Other than that, can't find anything
on the fella even to raise an eyebrow.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.400
Maybe the first-aider just
picked the wrong bloke.

31:02.479 --> 31:07.360
Tony. Tell me you've got a DNA match
and I can go and arrest someone?

31:07.439 --> 31:10.800
Afraid not. I do have a couple
of healed fractures, though,

31:10.879 --> 31:13.239
- now that I've done a full MRI.
- Meaning what?

31:13.319 --> 31:16.319
She would have been hospitalised
a couple of times for breakages.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.400
- Might be worth checking it out.
- Right. Thanks.

31:21.519 --> 31:23.720
Have we got anything
significant on the parents?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.959
They don't have many
admirers in the village.

31:26.039 --> 31:30.479
Ah, well, maybe that trouble at home is
more serious than we've accounted for.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.519
Hey. This is PC Wooten, Missing Persons.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.159
George.

31:37.239 --> 31:39.479
Erm, I've had a little question about Mia.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.639
- Yeah, go on.
- What colour was the
festival wristband?

31:42.720 --> 31:44.680
- Blue, wasn't it?
- Aye, blue.

31:44.759 --> 31:48.079
That means she got it in
advance. It's the VIP one.

31:49.759 --> 31:53.239
So we can't assume she went
to that festival at all.

31:53.319 --> 31:56.920
It just means that she was given
it by someone in with the band.

31:57.560 --> 32:01.839
Right. Well, we're all going to a gig.

32:14.839 --> 32:17.159
- Have you sorted it?
- Yes, ma'am. All sorted.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.079
Thanks, mate.

32:32.079 --> 32:34.079
I'm gonna check the bar.

32:34.839 --> 32:37.519
Have you seen this lass by any chance?

32:54.839 --> 32:57.319
- Her down the front!
- I can't hear you!

32:57.400 --> 33:00.479
Her down the front. She's
in one of Mia's photos!

33:07.119 --> 33:08.560
Hey!

33:10.839 --> 33:12.759
Out of my way!

33:45.800 --> 33:49.839
You were allocated a number
of these bands. Correct?

33:49.920 --> 33:53.319
- To give out to your select few.
- Yeah, maybe.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.280
I can't say doing the
door is my top priority.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.600
Did you give one to this lass?

34:02.680 --> 34:04.400
That's the girl that went missing?

34:04.479 --> 34:08.280
- Mm-hm.
- Didn't we put up a
reward or something?

34:08.360 --> 34:10.680
- Did you ever meet her?
- No.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.400
That's strange.

34:17.079 --> 34:19.519
So when might this have been taken?

34:21.319 --> 34:23.319
Erm...

34:25.839 --> 34:27.800
Sunderland, maybe?

34:27.879 --> 34:29.879
When was that?

34:30.839 --> 34:32.920
A few months back.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.600
So how did one of those bands
come into her possession?

34:38.720 --> 34:40.439
If she's missing...

34:41.479 --> 34:44.159
.. how do you know she
has one in her possession?

34:47.560 --> 34:52.280
Because she's not missing any more, pet.
Her body was found Wednesday afternoon.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.039
We had no clue. We've been stuck
in rehearsals all this week.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.439
Do you recognise this lass?

35:06.519 --> 35:10.519
That's Erin. She's er...
She's our super-fan.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.400
Like, where we go, she goes.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.039
She'll have a couple of those bands.

35:17.119 --> 35:19.920
You should ask her about
your missing girl... Maya?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.479
- Mia.
- Mia. Mia, is it? Yeah.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.159
They were mates, I think.

35:25.039 --> 35:27.439
And were you ever mates
with either of them?

35:28.079 --> 35:29.639
No.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.800
Groupies are not my style.

35:33.039 --> 35:34.759
No sex? No drugs?

35:34.839 --> 35:36.800
Just... Just rock and roll.

35:51.959 --> 35:53.839
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.319
- That's a matter of opinion.
- Erin Michaels.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.920
Moved out of her last known
address about a month ago.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.759
We got her on candid camera over there,
but we don't pick her up any later.

36:02.839 --> 36:05.839
- So she jumped in the
river and swam for it?
- Very funny.

36:05.920 --> 36:09.560
The good news is she left her
bag behind when she scarpered.

36:09.639 --> 36:10.920
And look at this.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.720
Just a moment.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.680
Look. Illegal legal highs.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.920
I want that girl found.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.879
She was at that festival
and never came forward,

36:20.959 --> 36:22.839
and I want to know why.

36:25.839 --> 36:28.839
Come on, theories. No matter how daft.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.200
Erin supplied the drugs
that caused Mia's whitey.

36:32.280 --> 36:36.519
Mia kicked off, Erin killed her to
silence her about the dodgy drugs.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.280
Strangulation, though?

36:39.360 --> 36:42.239
- That's a bit much, isn't it?
- Well, it could be an accident.

36:42.319 --> 36:44.039
Came off the back of a fight.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.439
No. Tony said there was no fight.

36:48.239 --> 36:51.119
And why take the body all
the way back to the moor?

36:52.319 --> 36:54.639
How's a lass gonna do that?

36:54.720 --> 36:56.720
Unless she had some help.

36:57.759 --> 37:00.400
Ma'am. The little lad, the brother.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.360
- What?
- His school just phoned Hicham.

37:02.439 --> 37:04.680
He wasn't in yesterday or this morning.

37:04.759 --> 37:06.920
What'd the parents have to say?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.680
They told Welfare he left
as usual on his bike.

37:09.759 --> 37:13.000
- The parental concern's overwhelming!
- Yeah.

37:14.959 --> 37:19.879
So if that lad's not going to
school... where IS he going?

37:33.159 --> 37:35.360
Why would he come here?

37:35.400 --> 37:39.000
No idea. He was just lying in the
back seat, playing on his phone.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.119
Maybe he came here with his sister.

37:42.159 --> 37:43.959
I don't know.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.439
Struck me those kids would do
anything to get out of the house.

37:47.079 --> 37:50.400
- I mean, Mia did come
here fairly regular.
- Yeah? Why was that?

37:52.879 --> 37:55.239
Mam and dad collected
their rent in cash.

37:55.280 --> 37:59.519
She collected it so it wouldn't
go through the books, you know.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.079
- Right.
- Should I have rung Mal first?

38:02.119 --> 38:04.720
Aye, you should. But you
were right to call us.

38:04.759 --> 38:07.720
I just didn't want him
getting in trouble with them.

38:08.479 --> 38:10.479
Did he have any mates here?

38:11.159 --> 38:15.079
Not as such. I've seen him mucking
about with a couple of guys on and off.

38:15.119 --> 38:18.000
- Can you point them out to us, love?
- They've gone to the depot.

38:18.039 --> 38:20.759
Jan and Blazej, their names are.

38:20.800 --> 38:26.079
Blazej... Weren't they the fellas who
were in the pub the night she left?

38:26.119 --> 38:29.079
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
anything. I was in the pub that day.

38:29.119 --> 38:33.159
Still, they're witnesses to what
we call "last known sighting".

38:33.200 --> 38:36.479
So when they get back, will you
point them in my direction, please?

38:36.519 --> 38:39.000
- Isn't that just picking on foreigners?
- No.

38:39.039 --> 38:40.360
Well, it looks like it.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.439
These workers do you
proud, don't they, love?

38:45.479 --> 38:47.720
Hm? Make you decent money.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.560
I can see why you'd
want to protect them.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.079
I don't see why you're hassling people
locally. She went missing miles away.

38:53.119 --> 38:55.280
Hassling? Who am I hassling?

38:55.319 --> 38:57.200
Ah. Your mate Gary.

38:57.239 --> 38:59.000
- Gary had nothing to do with it.
- No?

38:59.039 --> 39:03.839
That fella's been half blown
up for his country. Last thing
he needs is pressure from you lot.

39:03.879 --> 39:06.600
He's not the big
"I am" everyone reckons.

39:11.639 --> 39:13.439
Aiden.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.600
- Did you get through to his parents?
- Yeah, I just got through.

39:18.639 --> 39:23.759
See if you can track down
a couple of workers gone to
the depot. Jan and Blazej.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.800
And chase up Hicham with
those background checks.

39:26.839 --> 39:30.879
Oi, get off! Come on, your
mam will be worried about you.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.759
She doesn't care about us.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.800
Ah, shut up, and get in the car.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.400
- Who gave you that?
- No-one.

39:43.439 --> 39:45.319
Well, you didn't wake up with it.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.360
Just some lads in the village.

39:48.079 --> 39:50.239
They pick on us sometimes.

39:51.479 --> 39:53.319
Why's that, then?

39:53.360 --> 39:55.720
Cos I'm a Hinkin, I suppose.

39:55.759 --> 39:57.959
Jan's gonna teach us how to box.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.079
Jan? That's one of
the pickers, isn't it?

40:01.879 --> 40:04.000
Just need to get a bit taller first.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.639
My dad says your lot can't be trusted.

40:12.039 --> 40:14.879
Is that why you're not
being honest with me?

40:14.920 --> 40:18.000
- Hm?
- Don't know what you mean.

40:18.039 --> 40:22.239
Well, you told me your
sister couldn't be dead.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.959
Now, why did you say that?

40:32.360 --> 40:36.560
Well, we could do this the hard way and
I could go through your phone log...

40:38.200 --> 40:40.400
.. or you could just tell us the truth.

40:43.479 --> 40:46.839
- She messaged us.
- When was this?

40:47.720 --> 40:49.839
Must have been three weeks ago.

40:53.079 --> 40:55.680
- "JJ"?
- Jason John.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.920
Mia always called us that.

40:58.839 --> 41:02.360
- Anyone else call you that?
- Just Mia.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.680
So, what else are you not telling us?

41:06.479 --> 41:08.479
Just the one about Newcastle.

41:09.319 --> 41:11.159
What about Newcastle?

41:11.200 --> 41:13.200
Said that's where she was.

41:15.159 --> 41:17.479
What was your sister doing in Newcastle?

41:19.239 --> 41:23.319
- She found herself a job.
- She tell you where?

41:24.079 --> 41:25.879
Just a bar, she said.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.200
- One of those fancy pubs.
- So you knew she was doing a flit.

41:32.119 --> 41:34.159
Did you tell anyone else?

41:34.200 --> 41:36.200
It was our secret.

41:36.239 --> 41:39.200
And you kept it quiet all this time.

41:40.119 --> 41:42.119
She said she'd come back for us.

41:43.639 --> 41:46.959
The day she left.
Soon as she was sorted.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.479
She promised.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.920
Well, go on. Sling your hook.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.839
Go and get cleaned up. You're filthy.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.280
- Where'd you find him?
- He was up in the fields.

42:27.119 --> 42:28.800
Jack Madden called us.

42:28.839 --> 42:30.519
I warned him to stay away.

42:30.560 --> 42:34.720
He was gone for hours and it
took someone else to call us.

42:34.759 --> 42:37.319
Lives in a world of his own, that one.

42:37.360 --> 42:41.239
That shiner he's got.
Said he was in a fight.

42:41.280 --> 42:44.839
Well... if that's what he told you.

42:44.879 --> 42:47.280
He's been wagging school.
Did you know that?

42:49.839 --> 42:51.720
Checking up on us, were you?

42:51.759 --> 42:54.439
They're right to be concerned
if he's missing classes.

42:54.479 --> 42:57.720
I've been teaching him here
at the farm. Home schooling.

42:57.759 --> 43:02.639
Mm. Anyway, I wanted to talk
to you about Mia's postmortem.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.639
Showed up some old
injuries. A broken arm.

43:07.159 --> 43:09.680
She fell off a horse a few years ago.

43:10.479 --> 43:15.159
- You can check at the hospital.
- No, no. I don't think
it'll come to that.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.360
I know what they're
saying in the village.

43:17.400 --> 43:21.400
"It's the Hinkin girl gone
missing. They must have had
something to do with it."

43:21.439 --> 43:23.360
Well, I won't take it from them...

43:24.400 --> 43:26.680
.. and I won't take it from you.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.000
Well, I'm glad we've
cleared the air, love.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.000
- All right, sir.
- You know that weekend
off I promised you?

43:50.039 --> 43:53.400
I'm out on the town with the
missus. She's got a table booked.

43:53.439 --> 43:55.439
You're out on the town with me, love.

43:55.639 --> 43:59.159
I know where Mia tipped
up after that festival.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.479
She was working in Newcastle.

44:08.119 --> 44:08.879
Hey!

44:10.439 --> 44:12.600
Mark's got a trace on
the phone's location.

44:12.639 --> 44:14.839
Mia sent those texts
from somewhere in town.

44:14.879 --> 44:16.879
So, definitely from here?

44:19.600 --> 44:21.720
How could Missing Persons cock that up?

44:21.759 --> 44:24.479
Her mobile phone was switched
off. Case had gone cold.

44:24.519 --> 44:26.239
Oh, that's all right, then!

44:26.959 --> 44:30.119
And let's say she WAS
planning on doing a bunk.

44:30.159 --> 44:33.879
That must have taken some planning.
So, who else was in on it?

44:33.920 --> 44:35.759
Aside from her brother.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.839
- Anything?
- Er, nothing yet, ma'am.

44:40.680 --> 44:43.879
They might remember a bit
more when they're sober, mind.

44:46.079 --> 44:51.479
Er, we can ask around the market and
I can talk to some of the bar staff.

44:51.519 --> 44:54.360
Aye. Then work your way
down to the quayside.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.759
- Ma'am.
- Nice little crawl for you, Kenny.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.560
He doesn't get out much these days.

44:58.600 --> 45:01.000
We'll take the rest of
the bars on the strip.

45:02.439 --> 45:05.639
You got ID on you? This
fella might not let you in.

45:06.759 --> 45:08.759
We're not jumping the queue, love.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.639
Excuse me, love. Where
will I find the manager?

45:16.680 --> 45:18.400
Zoe's over there.

45:22.600 --> 45:25.879
- Are you Zoe, the manager?
- Yeah, that's me.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.879
- DCI Stanhope.
- How can I help?

45:28.920 --> 45:31.600
We're trying to trace the
movements of this woman.

45:31.639 --> 45:34.039
We believe she's been
working in the area.

45:35.239 --> 45:38.119
Yeah, I know her. That's Mia.

45:38.159 --> 45:40.600
Is there somewhere quiet
we can talk, love?

45:40.639 --> 45:42.639
- I mean...
- Yeah, come with me.

45:45.959 --> 45:48.360
I heard they found a body.

45:48.400 --> 45:51.280
Mm. Burntridge Moor.

45:51.319 --> 45:53.319
18.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.560
- Poor girl.
- How well did you know her?

45:56.600 --> 45:59.200
Er, she was one of the regulars.

45:59.239 --> 46:01.560
Asked about some bar work.
I said I'd take her on.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.560
- She was working here?
- Well, that's just it.

46:04.600 --> 46:08.720
She was all set to start on the
Saturday. Never turned up for her shift.

46:09.159 --> 46:11.519
You didn't call her to
find out what had happened?

46:11.560 --> 46:15.600
There are always people looking for
work. I don't give second chances.

46:15.639 --> 46:17.639
Mm.

46:18.479 --> 46:20.319
You say she came in here a lot?

46:20.879 --> 46:23.680
There were plenty of fellas
who'd buy her a drink.

46:24.479 --> 46:27.800
Did any of these fellas
ring alarm bells?

46:27.839 --> 46:29.839
Well, yeah. There's one.

46:31.119 --> 46:34.200
Parks up in his car, never comes in.

46:34.239 --> 46:36.159
Still there sometimes after closing.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.280
- Did you clock what sort of car?
- Nothing flash.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.800
Mud on the bonnet,
windows needed a clean.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.879
Did you ever see this fella with Mia?

46:45.920 --> 46:49.439
I'd have warned him off.
Something about him, you know?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.400
You seen him lately?

46:52.439 --> 46:55.159
I'll run a check, see if
the plates jump out at us.

46:56.680 --> 47:00.200
Hold on, love. Hold on. Who
did she knock about with?

47:00.239 --> 47:02.280
She was mates with one of the barmaids.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.639
It was Erin who put in
a good word for her.

47:05.959 --> 47:08.720
And is this Erin working tonight?

47:08.759 --> 47:11.000
Mm, should have been. Called in sick.

47:11.039 --> 47:13.239
Got an address?

47:22.759 --> 47:23.720
Oh, come on.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.280
Can we come in, love?

47:26.319 --> 47:28.759
Do I have a choice?

47:28.800 --> 47:31.560
I'll take that as a no...

47:33.479 --> 47:35.479
Bit of a party?

47:35.519 --> 47:39.920
Aye. Just a few drinks.
The boys from the band.

47:43.720 --> 47:47.479
- Look, I've told you all I know.
- Somehow I doubt that.

47:47.519 --> 47:51.280
Just tell her we're here, love.
Save me saying everything twice.

48:07.319 --> 48:11.200
- You must have known
she'd gone missing?
- Yeah, I knew.

48:11.959 --> 48:15.439
- It's nothing to do with me.
- So why'd you scarper the other night?

48:15.479 --> 48:17.959
I had a bit of weed on us. I panicked.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
Yeah, and the rest. We found these in
that bag that you dropped. Here you are.

48:22.039 --> 48:24.479
Yeah, we might as
well nick her for those.

48:24.519 --> 48:27.439
Unless you want to start
being straight with us. Hm?

48:27.839 --> 48:30.680
Those WhatsApp messages
sent from your mobile,

48:30.720 --> 48:32.839
day of the Eastbury Festival.

48:32.879 --> 48:37.560
Mia sent you a selfie. 6:52.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.400
"Drop dead gorgeous" and a smiley face.

48:40.439 --> 48:42.680
- That's the last time I heard from her.
- Mm.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.479
So she's all dressed up, on her way, hm?

48:45.519 --> 48:47.239
How's she getting there?

48:48.479 --> 48:50.800
- A lift, I think.
- A lift with who?

48:50.839 --> 48:52.319
I don't know.

48:52.360 --> 48:53.839
She didn't say.

48:56.280 --> 49:01.280
7:45, you send her another
message wondering where she is.

49:01.319 --> 49:02.920
Her phone was switched off.

49:02.959 --> 49:06.600
Why would she switch her phone off
if she's looking to hook up with you?

49:06.639 --> 49:08.639
I don't know.

49:10.079 --> 49:15.119
And then, a couple of days later,
you do hear she's gone missing --

49:15.159 --> 49:18.879
six weeks and counting -- and you
never thought to come forward.

49:18.920 --> 49:21.759
I just thought she was
keeping her head down.

49:24.759 --> 49:26.519
Now, why would you think that?

49:26.560 --> 49:28.039
Hm?

49:29.319 --> 49:31.200
I'll tell you why.

49:31.239 --> 49:35.039
Because you knew she was
planning on doing a flit.

49:35.079 --> 49:38.680
We know that Mia pitched up
in Newcastle. Come on, Erin.

49:38.720 --> 49:42.079
- She weren't with me.
- So where was Mia staying, then,

49:42.119 --> 49:44.439
if she wasn't staying with you?

49:47.600 --> 49:51.720
She said she'd found a flat
share somewhere in town.

49:51.759 --> 49:54.360
Well, that would have cost
an arm and a leg, love.

49:54.400 --> 49:57.959
She mucks out stables. Where
would she find the deposit?

50:01.280 --> 50:05.680
I know she was seeing
someone. Maybe he sorted it.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.720
So, who was this someone?

50:08.439 --> 50:11.200
A fella came into the bar once.

50:11.239 --> 50:13.800
Decent-looking, I suppose.

50:13.839 --> 50:15.839
Older.

50:17.119 --> 50:19.039
He was giving her grief about summat.

50:19.079 --> 50:23.920
Did she know this fella or was it just
some random bloke chancing his arm?

50:23.959 --> 50:25.800
She definitely knew him.

50:26.720 --> 50:30.800
I asked Mia if she was OK.
He told me to stay out of it.

50:30.839 --> 50:33.000
Just left them to it.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.839
These here drugs.
Did Mia ever take these?

50:39.879 --> 50:44.079
Mia never touched drugs. Yes, she liked
a bit of a drink, but that was it.

50:59.119 --> 51:02.479
Mark, Mia's postmortem results.

51:02.519 --> 51:04.720
What does the tox screen tell us?

51:04.759 --> 51:08.400
Er, traces of alcohol. Nothing
else found in her bloodstream.

51:08.439 --> 51:11.319
That conflicts with the account
we got from Meryl Fairchild.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.959
Aye, it does.

51:13.680 --> 51:16.400
- How much was that reward?
- £10,000.

51:16.439 --> 51:18.360
Do you think she's chasing the money?

51:18.400 --> 51:21.319
She's been giving us the
run-around. Get your coat.

51:22.400 --> 51:25.800
You told me Mia had
taken a couple of pills.

51:25.839 --> 51:27.439
That's what she told me, yeah.

51:27.479 --> 51:31.200
The tests we ran didn't show
up any drugs in her system.

51:31.239 --> 51:36.519
Her pupils were dilated and she
was definitely slurring her words.

51:36.560 --> 51:40.959
And the fella you picked out, the one
she argued with, end of the night...

51:41.000 --> 51:44.200
- What about him?
- We've tracked him down, love.

51:44.239 --> 51:48.800
Told him he's a murder suspect.
Wife, couple of kids...

51:49.720 --> 51:51.759
I said I wasn't sure.

51:52.759 --> 51:55.479
So is that a retraction?

51:55.519 --> 51:58.959
I should really get to work.
I'm on a shift in 20 minutes.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.959
You never saw that fella, did you, love?

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
- And I don't think you saw Mia.
- She was there.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.879
I know she was.

52:06.920 --> 52:12.879
If this had gone to court, lying under
oath, that is a serious offence.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.239
You'd be looking at
a seven-year stretch.

52:16.479 --> 52:19.079
- Prison?
- Obstructing a murder inquiry!

52:19.119 --> 52:23.000
- I didn't know she was dead!
- Why did you do it? For a pay-out?

52:24.439 --> 52:28.519
Her face was all over the
Internet, papers and that.

52:28.560 --> 52:32.959
I just... thought where's
the harm in coming forward?

52:34.200 --> 52:37.680
I didn't think they'd pay me
much attention, but PC Wooten...

52:39.239 --> 52:42.079
.. he listened to me
for a couple of hours.

52:42.119 --> 52:45.759
I suppose I felt... important.

52:46.959 --> 52:48.600
I'm so sorry.

52:57.879 --> 53:01.519
- I can't believe you didn't nick her.
- Leave all that to the CPS.

53:02.959 --> 53:05.479
We've been looking at
this with tunnel vision.

53:05.519 --> 53:10.159
What if Erin was telling the truth and
Mia never did turn up at that festival?

53:10.200 --> 53:13.439
Everyone just assumed she
had. Ran with Missing Persons.

53:13.479 --> 53:17.639
Living in Newcastle, first day
new job, never turns up for work.

53:18.720 --> 53:23.759
That fella she's been seen with.
He's the answer to all of this.

53:26.400 --> 53:28.800
- I'll show it to the boss.
- Thank you.

53:28.839 --> 53:32.759
Er, reported assaults on females
in the city centre, ma'am.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.879
This one stood out. Lorna Doyle.

53:34.920 --> 53:39.319
On a night out with her mates,
fella grabbed her up one of
the side streets off the strip.

53:39.360 --> 53:41.879
Was this 7th of August, early hours?

53:43.319 --> 53:46.079
She screamed and scared the guy off.

53:46.119 --> 53:48.560
Get her in, Kenny.
Get another statement.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.119
- Will do.
- You might want to see this, ma'am.

53:51.159 --> 53:54.000
We ran that AMPR check.
A few plates flagged up.

53:54.039 --> 53:55.800
One was traced back to Mal Hinkin.

53:55.839 --> 54:00.560
Yeah, he got a parking ticket
two months ago. It was marked
up as a vehicle of interest.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.519
- This is before his
daughter went missing.
- Yeah, but he'd driven
into town that night.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.319
Well, he could have been there
for any number of reasons.

54:07.360 --> 54:10.360
Six other times that we know
about since, always late.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.400
So where's he parking?

54:13.839 --> 54:17.439
Collingwood Street, Mosley Street,
close to the Diamond Strip.

54:18.079 --> 54:20.800
This was captured on
camera three weeks ago.

54:21.400 --> 54:26.000
That's just a couple of
hundred yards from where
this woman was followed, Kenny.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.479
And does that look like mud to you?

54:29.519 --> 54:32.959
- It could do with a wash.
- What did that bar manager say?

54:33.000 --> 54:36.600
Parked up in his car, mud
on the bonnet. Get him in.

54:42.560 --> 54:47.360
- Why am I here?
- Your plate flagged up
on routine surveillance.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.839
So? I drive into town now and then.

54:49.879 --> 54:54.639
Here you are Friday night three weeks
ago, parked up on Mosley Street.

54:54.680 --> 54:58.319
And you drive off
again three hours later.

54:58.360 --> 55:01.639
And again Saturday night into Sunday.

55:01.680 --> 55:04.560
I just needed to get out the house.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.959
See, we think Mia was living in
Newcastle since she left Brindale.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
- What?
- Yeah. We think she
rented a room in town.

55:12.039 --> 55:13.920
Oh, and you didn't think to tell us?

55:13.959 --> 55:15.839
Maybe you already knew.

55:15.879 --> 55:20.360
Now, if you wanted your daughter
back home where she belonged...

55:20.400 --> 55:22.239
locked away in that bedroom,

55:22.280 --> 55:25.959
you'd have every incentive to
try and find her, wouldn't you?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.759
So, how did you know where to look?

55:28.800 --> 55:30.759
- Mia called me once.
- Did she?

55:30.800 --> 55:34.319
Yeah. The middle of the night. She'd
gone out without telling us, drinking.

55:34.360 --> 55:37.200
Right. And when was this?

55:37.239 --> 55:39.239
Couple of months ago.

55:40.400 --> 55:43.759
She just spent all her money,
needed her dad to pick her up.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.239
I found her at one of those bars.

55:47.079 --> 55:50.959
Sitting on the pavement,
vomit all over her.

55:53.079 --> 55:56.239
I just took her home, cleaned
her up, and put her to bed.

55:59.079 --> 56:01.200
Never mentioned it again.

56:07.280 --> 56:11.360
She always hated the farm,
living in the middle of nowhere.

56:13.079 --> 56:15.079
Nell...

56:16.079 --> 56:18.879
- What?
- There was never any...

56:20.600 --> 56:22.720
It was almost as if she resented her.

56:23.319 --> 56:25.839
Resented Mia, her whole
life in front of her.

56:26.879 --> 56:29.360
So she couldn't let her go.

56:30.600 --> 56:33.800
Do you think that's why she
left home without telling you?

56:35.720 --> 56:37.720
If I'd been a better dad...

56:38.959 --> 56:41.079
.. maybe she'd still be alive.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.600
I couldn't just sit
there, waiting for news...

56:51.319 --> 56:53.600
.. with her disapproving silences.

56:54.959 --> 56:59.360
So I used to drive into town after dark.

57:02.239 --> 57:04.239
The place was so full of life.

57:06.439 --> 57:08.759
Sit there, waiting, watching.

57:10.879 --> 57:14.720
Hoping to catch a glimpse
of her. Just a glimpse...

57:16.280 --> 57:18.400
Then I'd just know that she was OK.

57:28.759 --> 57:30.200
Is this the man?

57:34.280 --> 57:37.079
So we've ruled out Mal
Hinkin as Lorna's attacker.

57:37.119 --> 57:39.360
Well, I'm not ruling him out completely.

57:40.079 --> 57:42.200
What about mistaken identity?

57:42.239 --> 57:44.680
I mean, they look very alike.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.759
They could be sisters.

57:46.800 --> 57:50.560
And say this fella is our
mystery bloke from the bar.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.360
So we're thinking Lorna was in
the bar the same night as Mia?

57:53.400 --> 57:54.879
Could have been.

57:54.920 --> 57:58.000
Blonde leaves at closing
time, coat on, it's dark.

57:58.039 --> 58:01.600
He goes after her, turns
out it's Lorna. Big mistake.

58:01.639 --> 58:05.360
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am. Uniform
have reported a disturbance.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.200
Brindale. In Jack Madden's field.

58:09.759 --> 58:10.479
Now what?

58:11.600 --> 58:14.200
- (Arguing)
- Lads, calm down.

58:24.560 --> 58:26.600
You got any idea what's going on here?

58:27.360 --> 58:30.039
A woman came into the pub, said
Jan had tried it on with her.

58:30.079 --> 58:32.159
Got a bit hands-on.

58:32.200 --> 58:34.439
What, and this lot have
come to teach him a lesson?

58:34.479 --> 58:37.039
Yeah, well, he says it was
all a misunderstanding, so...

58:37.079 --> 58:40.159
- If he threw a punch...
- Yeah, well, it was Owen
who provoked him.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.159
He's done nothing wrong.

58:45.959 --> 58:49.720
Follow him down to the
station. Friendly face?

58:54.600 --> 58:59.759
Now you listen to me. Any justice
needs dispensing, that's my department.

58:59.800 --> 59:02.959
Well, you ask him what he's been
up to? Everyone knows he killed her!

59:03.000 --> 59:04.959
You want to hope that's not broken.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.039
- I want him charged with assault.
- Clear off, before I charge
you an' all. Go on.

1:00:00.759 --> 1:00:02.759
You think he killed her?

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:06.800
No, I'm keeping an open mind, love.

1:00:06.839 --> 1:00:09.119
Why, do you think he killed her?

1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:16.879
I was with Jan the day
the girl disappeared.

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:19.400
Aye, in the pub. I know.

1:00:19.439 --> 1:00:22.560
And you both walked back
here together. Is that right?

1:00:24.239 --> 1:00:26.360
- That's what he told the police?
- Mm.

1:00:29.079 --> 1:00:31.079
I left him in the village.

1:00:31.119 --> 1:00:33.639
Didn't see him again
for a couple of hours.

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:37.280
- So, where did he go?
- He disappears all the time.

1:00:38.159 --> 1:00:40.439
I don't think Janusz is a bad person.

1:00:40.479 --> 1:00:42.479
I know him as well as anyone.

1:00:55.079 --> 1:00:57.079
Thanks.

1:00:57.879 --> 1:01:00.479
Ma'am. Janusz Hiszpanski.

1:01:00.519 --> 1:01:03.319
He was arrested in Poznan
for domestic assault.

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:06.759
Beat up his missus. He jumped
bail before it went to trial.

1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:10.159
Get a SOCO team over to those fields.

1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:14.039
I want a sweep of the van and the
huts, see what else we've missed.

1:01:14.079 --> 1:01:15.400
Will do.

1:01:16.239 --> 1:01:18.239
Erin, come here.

1:01:21.439 --> 1:01:24.560
Now, you think yourself lucky
we didn't press charges.

1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:26.639
This whole Mia thing
just messed my head up.

1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:31.600
Get your head sorted out, because
next time I won't be so understanding.

1:01:31.639 --> 1:01:33.879
So are you heading back to Woody's?

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:37.920
- Got nowhere else to go.
- Yeah, well, at least we
know where to find you.

1:01:37.959 --> 1:01:39.600
Now, go on, hop it.

1:01:41.639 --> 1:01:43.639
Erin, love?

1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:48.360
Erm, if you do think of anything
that might help us with the case,

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:51.519
- here's my direct line.
- Yeah. I'll call you.

1:02:00.439 --> 1:02:03.879
- How long are you keeping him in for?
- That depends what he can tell us.

1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:07.200
- Shall I get a solicitor?
- I think that's a very good idea.

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:16.879
Well, well, well.

1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:20.319
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

1:02:22.479 --> 1:02:24.920
Domestic assault.

1:02:24.959 --> 1:02:27.400
You had no right to take this.

1:02:27.439 --> 1:02:29.519
The bairn got a name?

1:02:31.119 --> 1:02:32.759
Hannah.

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.319
Left the pair of them
high and dry, didn't you?

1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:40.000
- She wouldn't want to see me, anyway.
- I'm not surprised, if
you knocked her about.

1:02:40.039 --> 1:02:43.800
- I've put all that behind me.
- Save it all for the
coppers in Poznan, love.

1:02:43.839 --> 1:02:46.319
- Are you going to send me back?
- What do you think?

1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:49.000
But not until you've
answered my questions.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:53.560
What do you want to know?

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:56.639
How long have you been
working for Jack Madden?

1:02:57.319 --> 1:03:01.400
A couple of month. When a job's
finished, we go somewhere else.

1:03:01.439 --> 1:03:04.280
Mm. And you drive the van.

1:03:04.319 --> 1:03:06.680
A few of us take it in turns, yeah.

1:03:07.439 --> 1:03:09.839
Do you ever visit the bars in the city?

1:03:09.879 --> 1:03:12.839
Nah, no. Not on the
wages he pays us, no.

1:03:12.879 --> 1:03:15.079
You prefer the village pub.

1:03:16.639 --> 1:03:19.039
That place wouldn't
stay open without us.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:24.439
Course, you were in the pub the night
Mia Hinkin went missing, weren't you?

1:03:24.479 --> 1:03:27.879
Along with your mate, Blazej Bobienski.

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:31.360
I've already told the police this.

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:35.839
What is it? 20 minutes
from the pub to the fields?

1:03:35.879 --> 1:03:38.360
- It's near enough.
- Mm.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:41.400
But you were gone for a
couple of hours, weren't you?

1:03:41.439 --> 1:03:46.560
According to your mate, who's come
forward and given us another statement.

1:03:48.639 --> 1:03:50.639
So where were you?

1:03:51.439 --> 1:03:53.360
Hm?

1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:55.560
There was somewhere I needed to be.

1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:58.600
I've got a forensic team
checking that van as we speak,

1:03:58.639 --> 1:04:01.079
so I'm gonna need something
better than that, love.

1:04:01.119 --> 1:04:03.119
Where were you?

1:04:04.639 --> 1:04:06.639
I've got all night.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:12.639
He'd been carrying on with the landlady.

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:16.959
Said they went for a walk. It's the
first time I've heard it called that.

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.839
I take it Owen doesn't know, then.

1:04:18.879 --> 1:04:23.000
Hey, Kenny. Get over to The
Lion and talk to that landlady.

1:04:23.039 --> 1:04:25.159
- See if his alibi checks out.
- Will do.

1:04:26.039 --> 1:04:26.839
Tony.

1:04:26.879 --> 1:04:29.519
That million-dollar
question you asked me.

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.680
Might just have worked out the answer.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:34.360
I measured the enzymes
in Mia's muscle tissue.

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:36.400
The breakdown products that presented,

1:04:36.439 --> 1:04:39.959
they prove that she was
dead for at least five weeks.

1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:43.000
What?

1:04:43.039 --> 1:04:44.319
Are you sure about that?

1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:47.400
It wasn't consistent with the
rate of tissue decomposition.

1:04:47.439 --> 1:04:50.560
Maybe her body had been
stored somewhere cold.

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:52.680
- Dead five weeks?
- Mm-hm.

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:58.360
Well, that means she couldn't have
sent those texts to her brother.

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:00.759
And if she didn't send them...

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:05.119
.. well, who did?

1:05:22.519 --> 1:05:24.600
I take it you did go home last night?

1:05:24.639 --> 1:05:27.239
Mia was killed five weeks ago.

1:05:28.159 --> 1:05:30.079
So she didn't send those texts to Jason.

1:05:30.119 --> 1:05:32.839
No, she didn't. The
killer must have done.

1:05:32.879 --> 1:05:35.720
Wanted the lad to think
she was still alive.

1:05:35.759 --> 1:05:40.639
I mean, let's face it, our chances of
finding that body were less than zero.

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:44.000
We'd all be thinking she was still
alive if it wasn't for that downpour.

1:05:44.039 --> 1:05:45.200
Clever, then.

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:48.079
So, we are back to square...

1:05:54.759 --> 1:05:56.759
Those witness statements...

1:05:59.119 --> 1:06:01.879
- Something you want to share?
- No, I want George.

1:06:03.159 --> 1:06:05.159
- Morning, ma'am.
- Aye, morning.

1:06:09.519 --> 1:06:11.800
- George, where are you?
- Hello?

1:06:12.519 --> 1:06:17.280
George, that string of tip-offs
you had, Mia Hinkin case.

1:06:17.319 --> 1:06:20.400
- You still got all
that on your computer?
- Aye, still on the system.

1:06:20.439 --> 1:06:22.439
Could you bring it up for us, love?

1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:26.920
Ah...

1:06:34.479 --> 1:06:37.200
- Ah...
- Mm. Witness statement.

1:06:37.239 --> 1:06:40.680
Mm. Here you are:
"Blonde wearing a red scarf."

1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:44.319
- Now, who called that in?
- Erm... male caller.

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:47.639
Rang Missing Persons three
days after Mia disappeared.

1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:52.159
Witness reported seeing a girl
walking along the road, 7:30pm,

1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:55.439
- on the night she was last seen.
- Well, where was that?

1:06:55.479 --> 1:06:57.959
Er, just off the 629.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.759
That's the road down to Brindale
Town. I'll print this out.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.879
So she'd already left the village.

1:07:05.159 --> 1:07:07.360
Why wasn't this followed up?

1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:09.239
Caller was anonymous and...

1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:12.319
it was never established
she was wearing a scarf.

1:07:12.360 --> 1:07:14.360
Well, we didn't know she was.

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:17.079
Must have been in her bag, put
it on after she left the pub

1:07:17.119 --> 1:07:21.000
because, look, she sent her mate
a selfie and she's wearing it.

1:07:21.039 --> 1:07:24.839
- So if the police didn't
put out that information...
- Precisely.

1:07:24.879 --> 1:07:28.600
Whoever called that in must
have seen her that night.

1:07:28.639 --> 1:07:31.000
- I need you to trace that caller.
- OK.

1:07:33.759 --> 1:07:36.319
Er, ma'am? Zoe Merrin just called.

1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:39.800
- Said Erin didn't turn up
for her shift last night.
- So, what's new?

1:07:39.839 --> 1:07:42.000
Actually, has anyone
called the boyfriend?

1:07:42.039 --> 1:07:44.759
He says he hasn't seen her, but
I've sent a car to his place.

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:48.079
Keep us posted.
Now, listen up, everyone.

1:07:48.119 --> 1:07:52.319
Finally a few chinks of light,
thanks to our friends in the basement.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:56.439
A tip-off! Someone saw a
blonde girl wearing a red scarf

1:07:56.479 --> 1:07:58.400
the evening Mia Hinkin went missing.

1:07:58.439 --> 1:08:02.519
Now, we know a scarf or something
similar was used as the murder weapon

1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:06.479
and I'd lay money that the fibres
found will match that scarf.

1:08:07.479 --> 1:08:09.479
- So, who called this in?
- Anonymous.

1:08:09.519 --> 1:08:11.400
Saw her down the Brindale road.

1:08:11.439 --> 1:08:15.239
- She could have hitched
a lift from anyone.
- No. I think she knew her assailant.

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.200
- What makes you so sure?
- Because of those texts to the brother.

1:08:19.239 --> 1:08:24.000
"JJ"? That was Mia's nickname for him.
So, who else would have known that?

1:08:24.039 --> 1:08:26.479
So, her killer must have
known she was doing a flit.

1:08:26.519 --> 1:08:29.280
Exactly! Now, how did he find that out?

1:08:29.959 --> 1:08:33.280
Hm? Well, it's certainly
not from her brother.

1:08:33.319 --> 1:08:36.920
- That was his big secret.
- Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

1:08:36.959 --> 1:08:39.439
We got lucky. Tip off
the Missing Persons.

1:08:39.479 --> 1:08:42.280
Call came from a phone
registered to Gary Tovey.

1:08:45.159 --> 1:08:46.759
Well done, George.

1:08:58.319 --> 1:09:01.720
- Any news?
- There's been a few developments, yeah.

1:09:01.759 --> 1:09:05.119
- Is your husband home?
- He went out about an hour ago.

1:09:05.159 --> 1:09:07.239
I can call him if you need me to.

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.400
Is this his number?

1:09:10.759 --> 1:09:13.479
Aye, that's his mobile.
What's all this about?

1:09:13.519 --> 1:09:15.839
The evening Mia Hinkin went missing.

1:09:15.879 --> 1:09:18.319
You told us your husband
was home all evening.

1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:21.239
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's not the case, is it, love?

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:24.280
Because we can place him
up on the Brindale road.

1:09:24.319 --> 1:09:26.319
He might have gone for
a run, that's all.

1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:29.119
So why did he tell us he
saw Mia Hinkin that night?

1:09:29.159 --> 1:09:32.079
Gary never saw Mia at all that
night. I was there when he told you.

1:09:32.119 --> 1:09:35.400
Look, I'm sorry to have to
ask you this, Mrs Tovey,

1:09:35.439 --> 1:09:39.519
but was there something going on
between your husband and Mia Hinkin?

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:42.479
What kind of question's that?

1:09:42.519 --> 1:09:44.759
One you haven't answered, love.

1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:46.479
No.

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:50.800
- You seem pretty sure of that.
- I know my husband.

1:09:50.839 --> 1:09:54.759
I know he wouldn't...
She was still just a kid.

1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:57.720
Mm. So where can I find him?

1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:01.639
You could try the Ropehaugh Woods.

1:10:28.119 --> 1:10:30.039
Your wife said we'd find you here.

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:35.959
- So, what couldn't wait?
- Phone call to Missing Persons.

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.519
Anonymous tip-off traced to your mobile.

1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.600
I just heard she'd gone missing.

1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:48.759
- Wanted to make sure they found her.
- Ah, we found her right enough.

1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:51.839
Dead and buried up on the
moor. Go there a lot, do you?

1:10:51.879 --> 1:10:54.920
- It's good for running.
- Is that what you were doing?

1:10:57.479 --> 1:11:01.639
- What else would I be doing?
- We'd like to interview
you down the station.

1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:07.360
I've got to speak to Claire.

1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:10.839
You're talking to me first.
My sergeant will drive.

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.959
Give me the keys.

1:11:23.159 --> 1:11:25.759
How long were you in Afghanistan?

1:11:26.639 --> 1:11:29.079
Two-year tour. Royal Engineers.

1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.319
Back from the war. That must have
been hard, finding your feet.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:35.839
No. Good to be home.

1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:39.920
Your missus, running the
stables, making ends meet.

1:11:39.959 --> 1:11:42.600
You must have felt
surplus to requirements.

1:11:42.639 --> 1:11:45.000
Bit of a third wheel, hm?

1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:49.400
And then Mia starts showing
some interest, well...

1:11:49.439 --> 1:11:52.639
She got it into her head there
was something between us.

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:54.519
And was there?

1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:59.360
Look, maybe I indulged her.
We had a laugh, you know?

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:01.759
- Ah.
- Teasing, bit of banter. That's all.

1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:05.560
She confide in you?

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:07.600
Sometimes.

1:12:08.439 --> 1:12:12.800
I think we both knew what it felt like
to be stuck in the village, you know?

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:17.720
Did you ever meet her
in a bar in the city?

1:12:17.759 --> 1:12:20.200
No. Why would I?

1:12:20.239 --> 1:12:25.000
Well, we think she'd taken
a room in a flat there. Someone
must have paid for that.

1:12:25.039 --> 1:12:26.360
And you think it was me?

1:12:26.879 --> 1:12:30.879
She didn't get that kind of money
mucking out your stables, did she, love?

1:12:32.639 --> 1:12:36.000
She told me she'd found a place to
stay. I don't know how she paid for it.

1:12:36.039 --> 1:12:38.400
Ah. So, you knew she was leaving?

1:12:38.439 --> 1:12:41.119
I knew she needed a lift to
the bus station. That's all.

1:12:41.159 --> 1:12:42.959
How'd you know that?

1:12:43.759 --> 1:12:46.720
She phoned me. Must have been lunchtime.

1:12:46.759 --> 1:12:48.759
I was in the pub with Jack.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:50.759
What, and asked you
to pick her up later?

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:52.800
Seven o'clock in the village.

1:12:56.239 --> 1:12:59.920
Should have said no, but she could
really lay it on when she wanted to.

1:12:59.959 --> 1:13:04.239
Hm. So you tell your missus
you're going for a run, hm?

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:07.119
- Yep.
- Do you tell her you
were picking up Mia?

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.479
She didn't know about that.

1:13:09.519 --> 1:13:12.959
Well, we know she didn't
make it as far as Brindale.

1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:18.759
So what happened in the car that night?

1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:26.000
I'm driving, she's talking.
She's saying she's gonna miss me.

1:13:26.039 --> 1:13:27.839
She says we should run away together.

1:13:27.879 --> 1:13:29.920
I've no idea where any
of this is coming from,

1:13:29.959 --> 1:13:34.280
so I pull the car over...
just to talk, mind.

1:13:35.119 --> 1:13:38.920
- And er...
- What, she makes a move on you?

1:13:38.959 --> 1:13:41.000
I swear, I didn't see it coming.

1:13:41.039 --> 1:13:44.759
Ah, well, how would you,
love? It's all in her head.

1:13:46.079 --> 1:13:49.759
So I says, "Look, Mia,
I'm taking you home."

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.079
Mm-hm. So why didn't you?

1:13:52.119 --> 1:13:55.200
Then she threatens to
tell Claire everything.

1:13:55.239 --> 1:13:57.239
There's nothing to tell...

1:13:59.839 --> 1:14:03.920
.. and I tried... tried to
make her see sense, but...

1:14:03.959 --> 1:14:05.600
she was already out of the car.

1:14:05.639 --> 1:14:07.959
Slammed the door, walked away.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.920
- And you just let her go?
- Yeah, I just let her go.

1:14:11.959 --> 1:14:13.800
Hm. You sure about that?

1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:17.720
Yeah.

1:14:17.759 --> 1:14:20.280
I just... drove off...

1:14:20.319 --> 1:14:23.519
and left her... alone...

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:25.479
on the road.

1:14:41.839 --> 1:14:43.680
I think you killed her.

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:49.439
I swear on my kids'
lives... I didn't kill her.

1:14:52.159 --> 1:14:55.079
Gary Tovey's swabs.
They been tested yet?

1:14:55.119 --> 1:14:57.839
- Still waiting on results.
- Give Tony a kick up the arse.

1:14:57.879 --> 1:15:01.560
- I need some evidence
to tie him to this.
- We got hold of
Erin Michaels' boyfriend.

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:04.479
- He hasn't seen her since
you brought her in.
- Try her mobile.

1:15:04.519 --> 1:15:07.319
- Just keeps ringing out.
- Well, keep trying.

1:15:10.239 --> 1:15:13.360
'You have one message. Message one.'

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:15.839
'Yeah, this is Erin, Mia's mate.

1:15:15.879 --> 1:15:18.600
You said to call you if
I remembered anything.

1:15:18.639 --> 1:15:22.400
That fella that came into the bar,
the one that was pestering Mia.

1:15:22.439 --> 1:15:24.280
I think I've just seen him.'

1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:29.239
Please!

1:15:31.519 --> 1:15:32.839
Somebody!

1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:52.000
Oh, come on, wake up!

1:15:53.959 --> 1:15:57.079
We've got her leaving the station
on CCTV. Nothing after that.

1:15:57.159 --> 1:15:59.800
Why would anyone want
Erin out of the way?

1:15:59.879 --> 1:16:01.519
What are we missing?

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:05.600
What if Gary Tovey was the one who
argued with Mia at the bar that night?

1:16:05.839 --> 1:16:08.920
And Erin saw them. Well, she did.

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.560
So, she's a witness. And that
could tie him to the murder.

1:16:13.639 --> 1:16:15.920
Let's see what he's
got to say about that.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.400
Hang on, ma'am. His DNA
profile's just come back.

1:16:19.479 --> 1:16:21.039
Yeah? And?

1:16:21.119 --> 1:16:24.360
Doesn't match the skin cells that
we found under Mia's fingernails.

1:16:24.439 --> 1:16:26.920
- You're kidding me?
- Sorry, ma'am.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.079
Gary Tovey couldn't have killed her.

1:16:31.519 --> 1:16:32.239
DC Edwards.

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:35.720
We're chasing our bloody tails here.

1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:41.680
Right, so that's a
match? Thanks for that.

1:16:41.759 --> 1:16:43.319
- Ma'am?
- What?

1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:46.519
Forensics have just finished
a sweep of the pickers' van.

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:48.479
Mia's DNA was found in the back.

1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:50.479
That puts Jan back in the frame.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:52.519
Erin and Jan were at
the front desk together.

1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:56.519
- Jan's in custody. He can't
have gone after Erin.
- The pickers were working together.

1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:58.439
- What about the other worker?
- Blazej?

1:16:58.519 --> 1:17:01.639
- Yeah. He gave us that statement.
- He made sure his mate got arrested.

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:05.119
- Trying to take the heat off himself?
- It's always the quiet ones.

1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:09.920
But I saw him loading up
the van. The day we dropped
Mal Hinkin off at the farm.

1:17:11.159 --> 1:17:14.200
I want an All Units up
at those fields now.

1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:27.159
You lot never give up, do you?
You're gonna put me out of business.

1:17:27.239 --> 1:17:29.839
We need to talk to anyone
who'd been driving that van.

1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:33.200
- I didn't do anything!
- Calm down. You're in
enough trouble as it is.

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:37.079
- Is JJ here? I don't
want him to see this.
- I think he's in the warehouse.

1:17:43.519 --> 1:17:48.159
It was you Erin recognised
at the station, wasn't it?

1:17:48.239 --> 1:17:50.959
Where is she? What have
you done with her?

1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:57.319
- Stay where you are, Jason!
- Jack, what's going on?

1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:03.079
- Let the lad be.
- You trust me, don't you?

1:18:03.159 --> 1:18:06.800
Hasn't his family suffered
enough? Leave him be.

1:18:06.879 --> 1:18:09.800
Come on, Jack. You don't
want to be doing this.

1:18:10.439 --> 1:18:12.319
Hey. Come on...

1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:25.800
Stop him! Stop him!

1:18:26.439 --> 1:18:29.319
Jack, it's over! Jack! Jack, it's over.

1:18:33.479 --> 1:18:35.879
- It's over, Jack.
- Come on. Come with me.

1:18:35.959 --> 1:18:37.280
Thank you.

1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:40.759
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Mia Hinkin.

1:18:43.039 --> 1:18:45.319
Thank you, Blazej.

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:49.280
Take him to the office.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.319
I want a phone call.

1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:01.159
Tell us where Erin is,
I'll see what I can do.

1:19:01.239 --> 1:19:04.439
- Erin?
- The lass you followed
out of the station.

1:19:08.439 --> 1:19:10.959
All right, we'll do this the hard way.

1:19:12.319 --> 1:19:14.839
Two months ago, you put down a deposit.

1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:16.639
Rented room in Newcastle.

1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:18.920
The agency emailed us your signature.

1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:21.800
I needed a place in
town. Weekends, mainly.

1:19:21.879 --> 1:19:24.800
Nah. You rented that
place for Mia Hinkin.

1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:27.720
I barely knew the girl.

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:29.879
Her family own these fields.

1:19:29.959 --> 1:19:32.560
She collected the rent from
you on a regular basis.

1:19:32.639 --> 1:19:34.079
You told me that yourself.

1:19:34.159 --> 1:19:36.159
It was business.

1:19:36.959 --> 1:19:40.360
Now, Erin, this lass
that's gone missing,

1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:44.000
she told us she saw you
and Mia in town together.

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:48.039
Mm. Bit of a row, she said.

1:19:48.119 --> 1:19:51.920
Oh, I bet it put the wind up you when
you clocked her down at the station,

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.479
wondering if she'd been talking.
Is that why you followed her?

1:19:58.519 --> 1:20:02.159
Where is she? Where's Erin?

1:20:06.839 --> 1:20:09.759
What were your movements the
day Mia Hinkin went missing?

1:20:09.839 --> 1:20:11.360
It was weeks ago.

1:20:11.439 --> 1:20:14.759
Oh, I bet it's seared
on your memory, love.

1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:17.959
But I'll give you the heads-up.

1:20:18.039 --> 1:20:23.600
You meet your mate Gary in
the pub. Mia calls him, trying
to cadge a lift into town.

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:27.159
Oh, I bet he bragged
about that, didn't he?

1:20:27.239 --> 1:20:29.400
A schoolgirl crush.

1:20:30.479 --> 1:20:32.200
She was wasting her time with Gary.

1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:35.560
Oh? What, when she could have
been wasting her time with you?

1:20:35.639 --> 1:20:37.600
A fella who's used to
getting what he wants.

1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:40.600
It was Gary picked her up,
so why are you talking to me?

1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:45.479
Because we found her assailant's
DNA under her fingernails, love.

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:47.239
Which rules Gary out.

1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:53.959
So we'll be doing a little swab test
in a minute, if that's all right.

1:20:54.039 --> 1:20:56.239
And here's what I think happened.

1:20:57.759 --> 1:21:00.039
You meet Mia on the Brindale road.

1:21:00.119 --> 1:21:03.680
She's upset. Tells you
she's argued with Gary.

1:21:03.759 --> 1:21:05.759
Tells you she loves him.

1:21:06.759 --> 1:21:09.639
So you offer her a friendly
shoulder to cry on.

1:21:10.759 --> 1:21:12.400
I didn't see her that night.

1:21:12.479 --> 1:21:15.959
Cos you were the only one who ever
helped her, weren't you, love? Hm?

1:21:16.039 --> 1:21:18.920
The flat in town,
keeping it between you.

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:22.159
The money and whatever else.

1:21:22.239 --> 1:21:24.600
Cos you thought you were on a promise.

1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:28.920
Well, you got that wrong, didn't
you? It was Gary she wanted.

1:21:29.879 --> 1:21:31.280
No comment.

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:35.479
She was never gonna settle for a
fella like you, was she, love? Hm?

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:39.680
- That why you killed her?
- No comment.

1:21:39.759 --> 1:21:42.800
He throttles a young lass to
death, buries her up on the moor,

1:21:42.879 --> 1:21:45.360
and he's got nothing to say for himself.

1:21:47.039 --> 1:21:49.239
I gave her everything she ever needed.

1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:53.879
And she threw it back in my face.

1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:01.079
I will nail you for Mia's
murder and that is a promise.

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.360
But Erin? She has nothing
to do with this, love.

1:22:05.439 --> 1:22:10.039
- So, come on, do the right thing.
- Well, if you're so
clever, YOU figure it out!

1:22:10.119 --> 1:22:13.920
- We've got officers on
the way to your flat.
- Be my guest!

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.239
Huh?

1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:20.560
You'd better hope I find her.

1:22:31.159 --> 1:22:33.119
We don't even know if she's still alive.

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:35.200
Well, we've got to assume she is.

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:39.280
He'll have her here
somewhere, out the way.

1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:41.439
Where no-one can hear her.

1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:52.600
Where do they keep those leeks
before they go to the depot?

1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:54.680
Cold storage.

1:22:56.079 --> 1:22:59.759
And Tony said Mia's body
was kept somewhere cold.

1:23:01.959 --> 1:23:04.479
We're looking for a refrigerated unit!

1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:08.560
Mal says we're looking for a barn. There's a couple of cold
stores that are rarely used.

1:23:08.639 --> 1:23:11.600
- Did he say how far?
- It's there!

1:23:21.079 --> 1:23:23.519
Erin? Get this open!

1:23:24.879 --> 1:23:26.879
Erin, love?

1:23:27.879 --> 1:23:29.879
Erin, it's the police!

1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:38.759
Erin, love?

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:52.560
- Erin, love...
- I've got her.

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.879
Kenny, get an ambulance
down to Hinkin's field.

1:23:58.959 --> 1:24:00.519
It's OK, we've got you.

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000
We've got you, love.

1:24:08.759 --> 1:24:10.360
You're safe now, love.

1:24:20.519 --> 1:24:25.319
- You still at it?
- Ah, paperwork. Never stops.

1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.239
We got the fella who killed
her. Thought you'd like to know.

1:24:30.319 --> 1:24:31.920
How's the other girl?

1:24:32.519 --> 1:24:35.360
Shaken. But she'll be all right.

1:24:35.439 --> 1:24:37.639
- Team effort, then.
- Aye, you could say that.

1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:41.119
- You ever fancy a move upstairs...
- Ha! Now, there's an offer!

1:24:41.839 --> 1:24:45.039
Nah, 25 years, I'm still
getting used to this place.

1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:49.239
No, Mia was killed
the day she left home.

1:24:49.319 --> 1:24:51.519
Three days before she
was reported missing.

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.079
So, there's nothing you
could have done, love.

1:24:56.759 --> 1:24:59.159
Those are the people we
found in the last six weeks.

1:24:59.239 --> 1:25:01.680
The big pile? Still missing.

1:25:03.079 --> 1:25:07.079
That's the trouble with this job.
You spend your life chasing ghosts.

1:25:10.319 --> 1:25:14.000
A few of us erm... are
going for a pint later.

1:25:14.079 --> 1:25:16.439
I might even stretch it to
a round if you fancy it?

1:25:16.519 --> 1:25:21.039
Oh, no... Too many loose
ends to tie up, love.

1:25:21.119 --> 1:25:22.400
There's a meat raffle.

1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:26.119
Ah, you smooth talker!

1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:27.600
Be lucky.

1:25:35.079 --> 1:25:37.039
Ah...

1:25:51.319 --> 1:25:52.920
All right, Jason?

1:25:53.759 --> 1:25:55.519
Come on, then.

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.400
Mrs Hinkin?

1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.920
They've released your daughter's
body. You can bring her home.

1:26:22.479 --> 1:26:25.839
- So if there's anything
else you want...
- We'll be fine.

1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.920
Right.

1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:34.119
I loved her, you know.

1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:38.479
I bore her and I raised her.

1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:43.280
And I miss her more than anything.

1:26:48.639 --> 1:26:51.680
But your lad needs some loving, too.

1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:25.720
Miss.

1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:28.920
- Fetched you some eggs.
- Oh.

1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:33.079
Couldn't find any boxes.

1:27:34.119 --> 1:27:36.000
Eh, thanks, love.

1:27:36.079 --> 1:27:37.720
Look at them.

1:27:39.439 --> 1:27:41.360
I'll have them with
a little bit of toast.

1:27:41.439 --> 1:27:45.959
- That's lovely.
- Why do you wear that hat?

1:27:46.039 --> 1:27:48.639
- Eh?
- Do you wear that all the time, like?

1:27:50.439 --> 1:27:53.479
- No.
- Maybe it's about time
you got a new one.

1:27:54.879 --> 1:27:56.879
- See you.
- Yeah, see you, love.

1:27:58.439 --> 1:28:01.119
- Not a peep.
- I didn't say a word.

1:28:02.479 --> 1:28:05.159
- Good lad.
- Well, come on. Get a wiggle on.

1:28:05.239 --> 1:28:08.000
- Why, have you got to be somewhere?
- Aye, haven't you?

1:28:10.639 --> 1:28:13.959
- I thought you wanted to
take your missus out?
- Are you gonna baby-sit?

1:28:14.039 --> 1:28:16.319
Don't hold your breath.
