WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:15.849
<i>I was naked, terrified and confused.</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:18.310
<i>How could I have had sex with a man?</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
<i>And Bob "Boy Crazy" Barnard!</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:27.486
<i>With his perfect man beard and his perfect
man chest and his perfect man arms.</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:31.615
<i>I'd always admired women's things.</i>

00:31.698 --> 00:34.034
<i>Did I desire men's things, too?</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:37.079
<i>Had I been lying to myself my entire life?</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:39.581
<i>I needed time to think, alone.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:48.757
Fleeing the scene of the crime?

00:49.007 --> 00:51.176
No, I'm just late for work.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.804
Something tells me
your boss will understand.

00:54.763 --> 00:58.225
- Come here.
- Last night was an anomaly, an aberration.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.895
Look, Bob, I get it.
You're scared, ashamed, confused.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.982
Hell, I felt that way the first
eight or nine times I had gay sex.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.984
Could we please not call it that?

01:07.067 --> 01:10.779
All I'm saying is, if anyone understands
what you're going through, it's me.

01:11.446 --> 01:15.075
It doesn't mean last night was a mistake.
I told you, I love you.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.827
Stop, okay?

01:16.910 --> 01:20.122
Coralee and I have been
going to therapy for weeks,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.916
trying to work it out,
and we are really making progress.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.378
And yet you found yourself
on my doorstep last night. Why?

01:26.461 --> 01:28.755
Because I couldn't get that kissÂ out
of my head.

01:29.131 --> 01:33.802
And then, when you said that
maybe I'd spent 30 years hating you

01:34.344 --> 01:35.387
because really I was...

01:35.470 --> 01:36.930
Madly in love with me?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.265
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

01:39.266 --> 01:44.438
But I do think that maybe I had feelings
that I needed to explore.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.023
And now?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.900
Now, I have explored them,
and I can move on with my life.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.325
- Stop it.
- Why?

01:56.575 --> 01:57.993
Because I love it!

01:58.076 --> 02:00.495
And I don't know how it fits
into the rest of my life!

02:00.579 --> 02:02.372
All right. I'm sorry.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.877
I remember being where you are.
You just... you need time.

02:07.377 --> 02:12.424
I just hope we can keep seeing
each other while you figure it out.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.384
How? I have a wife.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.552
I do too.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.263
I love Etta Mae and Magnolia,

02:18.347 --> 02:20.349
but what they don't know can't hurt them.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.017
But you are lying to them.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.602
It's better than lying to myself,

02:23.935 --> 02:27.898
trying to convince myself
I felt fulfilled when I wasn't.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.316
So, what do I do?

02:29.691 --> 02:32.069
You got to do what I do.
You compartmentalize.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.072
You keep this and Coralee separate.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.416
<i>I couldn't believe the damage I'd done.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:48.335
<i>Pushing Dixie from the Ween-Mobile.</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:50.420
<i>Dumping her from a wheelchair.</i>

02:50.504 --> 02:52.464
<i>And there was no demon to blame.</i>

02:52.547 --> 02:54.800
<i>Which meant I was a horrible person.</i>

02:54.883 --> 02:58.553
We're celebrating.
It's your 18th birthday week,

02:58.637 --> 03:00.514
and I just really wanted
to kick it off right.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.935
After all, next year you'll be in college,
and I won't get to "mom" you anymore.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.979
Thanks, Mom, but I can't...

03:10.273 --> 03:12.192
Happy birthday week!

03:12.275 --> 03:15.112
Your mom told me she was making
the French toast. I couldn't resist.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.239
Eat mine.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.658
I can't. Not this close to regionals.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.868
Does that mean we can't do
our annual ritual?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.995
- Because I already placed the order.
- Sorry.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.290
But we always eat
an entire sheet cake from Costco.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.459
Getting sheet-faced
is my favorite tradition.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.629
We have to figure out some way
to celebrate.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.214
You're about to be an adult.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.552
I'll still be the same person
who dumped Dixie from the wheelchair.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.470
Everyone will still hate me.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.347
Come on, look on the bright side.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.016
After graduation,
you're gonna get a fresh start.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.101
I can't wait.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.358
Principal Martin wants to see me
before school. I'm sure it's about Dixie.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.195
Here, I'll eat your feelings.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.409
Mmm! Milk chocolate-y.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.077
Gooey.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.707
Mmm. The peanut butter's smooth
and not crunchy.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.585
Just take a bite.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.837
Just take a drink.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.716
<i>I wanted to believe
Bob "Boxer Brief" Barnard,</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:21.052
<i>that I could keep him
and Coralee separate.</i>

04:21.136 --> 04:24.222
<i>It at least seemed possible,
since she wasn't living in the house.</i>

04:25.599 --> 04:28.977
Coralee, what are you doing here?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.812
I decided to move back in.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.024
I feel really good about our talk,
and I thought about it,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.860
and I think that the only way that
this marriage is gonna make it

04:36.943 --> 04:38.737
is if it's under the same roof.

04:39.446 --> 04:44.242
So, you know, I...
Why are your knees all red?

04:45.327 --> 04:50.957
Oh! Oh, I was looking for my car keys,
high and low.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.250
Mostly low.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.923
So... does this mean that
you're back for good?

04:58.757 --> 05:00.509
Well, if that's okay with you.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.639
Bob, I'm sorry about Shane,
and you were right.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.309
My identity crisis
doesn't justify me cheating on you.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.603
No, it's okay. I get it.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.063
You do?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.523
What changed?

05:15.649 --> 05:18.193
I thought about it,

05:18.276 --> 05:23.406
and I understand now how sleeping
with another man,

05:24.074 --> 05:25.909
even just the one time,

05:25.992 --> 05:30.247
could make you have realizations
about yourself.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.668
You are the best husband.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.172
It feels so good to be this open
and honest.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.385
Why would you think I'm...

05:43.468 --> 05:44.636
Cold hands.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.473
Let me make you breakfast.
You must be exhausted.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.892
Why would you think I'm...

05:51.142 --> 05:52.769
The bed wasn't slept in.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.064
Was it an all-nighter at the office?

05:56.815 --> 05:57.774
Yes.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.193
Ever since Bob Barnard
has joined the firm,

06:00.277 --> 06:02.779
it has been work, work, work.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.949
Well, he may be the boss,
but don't let him ride you too hard.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.370
Okay, well,
if you don't have time for breakfast,

06:10.453 --> 06:12.664
maybe I can meet you
at the office for lunch.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.292
- I could bring something for you and Bob.
- No!

06:17.002 --> 06:20.297
<i>If I was gonna compartmentalize,
I needed to distract her.</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:23.592
I just mean focus on yourself.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.887
You said that you wanted
to beÂ a mompreneur.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.932
You just have to figure out a normal
everyday thing that annoys you,

06:31.016 --> 06:33.143
and then just figure out how to solve it.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.396
Who is blowing up your phone?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.106
<i>Bob "Back-Door Man" Barnard.</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:39.858
Oh, Patty.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.362
Another emergency.
I'm sorry. I know you don't like her.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.655
No, I don't.

06:45.739 --> 06:50.577
But if you are gonna support my interests,
then I have to support yours.

06:50.827 --> 06:55.165
Whether they be Patty
or pageants or anything else.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.751
Nope, nothing else.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.714
<i>That's weird.</i>

07:02.797 --> 07:06.635
<i>Besides being suddenly bisexual,
was I also suddenly psychic?</i>

07:10.388 --> 07:12.307
You're suspending Patty?

07:12.390 --> 07:13.642
I have no choice.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.770
The school has a strict
anti-bullying policy.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.896
Oh, my God.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
I'm the bully?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.150
No, you're not. Dixie is.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.862
Dixie is a paraplegic,
who Patty dumped out of a wheelchair

07:26.321 --> 07:29.115
at an anti-bullying assembly.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.952
Well, yes, that was
an unfortunate turn of events,

07:32.035 --> 07:33.828
but you can't suspend Patty.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.539
With a mark like that on her record,
she can't compete in regionals.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.916
This is horrible.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.751
I've become the person I've always hated.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.339
I'm turning 18, and I'm, like, literally
the worst possible version of myself.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.092
There has to be something I can do now.
What if I apologized?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.135
We tried that. That's how we got here.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.596
Okay, what if I made it up to Dixie?

07:52.555 --> 07:56.559
I could raise money
for a wheelchair-accessible ramp

07:56.935 --> 07:58.186
or a new wheelchair.

07:58.395 --> 08:02.607
I may have a solution
that could make everyone happy.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.822
<i>Patty had become public enemy number one.</i>

08:08.905 --> 08:13.410
<i>So, if I was gonna redeem her,
I knew I had to do something drastic,</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:16.663
<i>which meant reaching out
to Regina Sinclair.</i>

08:32.971 --> 08:34.472
Sinclair residence.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.350
Regina. It's Bob Armstrong.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.186
Hang on. Putting you on speaker.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.190
What in the hell is that noise?

08:45.734 --> 08:48.486
Contractor. I'm sanding my floors.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.321
What do you want, Bob?

08:50.405 --> 08:55.618
Well, Patty is turning 18, and she thought
she would like to use her birthday

08:55.702 --> 08:58.288
as a way to make amends to Dixie.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.582
<i>We were thinking
we could throw Patty a party</i>

09:00.665 --> 09:02.959
and turn it into a charity roast.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.211
We're gonna eat her?

09:05.628 --> 09:09.632
Honey, a roast is an event where people
make fun of the guest of honor.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.719
We could charge admission
and then use whatever money we raise

09:12.802 --> 09:15.305
to buy Dixie a new electric wheelchair.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.767
I don't want a new wheelchair.
We need a place to live!

09:18.850 --> 09:21.269
Ever since they foreclosed on our house,
we have nowhere to go.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.979
Ahem!

09:25.732 --> 09:29.486
If you want us on board,
we have some demands.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.573
A wheelchair and a van?
Can we really raise that kind of money?

09:33.656 --> 09:37.160
Let's hope so. Principal Martin said
if you can make amends,

09:37.243 --> 09:38.453
she'll let you off the hook.

09:38.536 --> 09:42.540
And that means
we can get you back into regional...

09:43.208 --> 09:45.919
- Are you even listening to me?
- Yeah, sorry.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.297
I haven't spoken with Christian
since the exorcism yesterday.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.132
I guess I should just check in.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.092
No, no, no.

09:52.842 --> 09:57.097
I wouldn't. Listen, I heard something
weird happened with Christian in Brazil.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.182
That's what I was trying to tell you
at the assembly.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.476
I'm gonna try and find out
more information from Bob Barnard.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.853
He's got contacts
from back when he was a DA.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.106
Barnard? Since when do you
ask that guy for favors?

10:06.523 --> 10:07.982
Since we're partners.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.317
At the law firm.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.278
Let's just focus on the roast.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.572
I'd rather not.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.991
Look, I do want to make amends,

10:17.075 --> 10:19.536
but getting roasted
sounds a lot like getting bullied.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.746
Oh, it's all in good fun.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.749
Plus, it'll make people like you,
letting 'em tell jokes.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.837
In every joke, there's truth,
and that might be more than I can handle.

10:28.920 --> 10:34.300
Look, it's hard to face the truth,
but you are about to be an adult,

10:34.717 --> 10:36.136
and that means doing scary things.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.389
Not everyone is brave enough
to lay themselves bare in public.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.099
Yeah, 'cause it's terrifying.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.643
But if you do it,
there'll be nothing left to fear.

10:43.726 --> 10:44.602
You'll be free.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.188
Trust me, it'll be great.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.941
Listen, I'm gonna work
on securing a location.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.985
You work on the refreshment situation.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.113
The less we spend on catering,
the more money we can raise.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.490
<i>I still wasn't sold on the roast,</i>

10:57.574 --> 11:01.035
<i>but Bob had been right about
everything else, so I had to trust him.</i>

11:01.119 --> 11:03.621
<i>Besides, it wasn't like things
could get any worse.</i>

11:08.960 --> 11:12.839
- What? What the hell?
- I'm officially courting you.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.886
Floor picnic, wine, and I've already
reached out about Christian.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.929
- Already? Thanks.
- Come on, sit down.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.139
- You got to eat.
- No.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.766
No. Don't argue with me.
I don't have time.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.020
I got to get to the rehab center.
Today's family day.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.648
How is Magnolia, by the way?

11:30.982 --> 11:33.902
Uh... better.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.154
At least that's what her therapist says.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.072
I'll tell you more later.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.119
- What?
- I don't know, you're just...

11:43.995 --> 11:48.833
so open and thoughtful and nice.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.835
It's like you're a different person.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.420
Well, I feel like a different person

11:52.503 --> 11:55.131
now that I don't have to hide
how I feel about you.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.138
Hey, Mr. Choi said he'd sponsor me
for the roast.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.765
Oh, that's great, honey.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.184
What's going on? Bad news?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.770
No. I don't know.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.608
I impulsively reached out to Mama's
old boyfriend Gordy on Facebook,

12:13.691 --> 12:16.361
and he actually wrote me back.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.572
Oh, he's still a hottie.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.325
You should totally friend request him
so you can see all of his photos.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.119
- No, I don't really need...
- Done.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.079
Okay.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.124
- Hey, Patty.
- Hey.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.086
Dee, did Nonnie tell you
I'm having a birthday party?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.964
- You coming?
- Yeah. She told me it was a roast.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.716
I'm surprised you went for that.
Sounds brutal.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.552
Yeah, well, it's all in good fun.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.347
And besides, I know the worst thing
people are gonna say about me.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.642
- That I dumped Dixie out of a wheelchair.
- That's only this week.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.896
What... what do you mean?

12:52.563 --> 12:57.068
Nothing. Just Nonnie's told me
a lot of funny stories and...

12:57.151 --> 12:58.278
Nonnie?

12:58.361 --> 13:01.489
It's nothing bad... or not that bad.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.325
Tell me. I mean, I have to be prepared.

13:07.245 --> 13:10.415
Oh, my God.
One story here and there isn't that bad,

13:10.498 --> 13:13.668
but when you put them all together,
people are gonna hate me even more.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.420
No, they're not. I don't hate you.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.629
I have to call Bob.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.673
I have to get him
to call this whole thing off.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.426
- She okay?
- How could you do that?

13:21.509 --> 13:23.803
I'm sorry. I didn't think
she would freak out like that.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.096
I should go after her.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.266
Of course. Another crisis, you go running.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.353
What's that supposed to mean?

13:32.895 --> 13:35.064
- I'm her best friend.
- You're her lapdog.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.859
Whenever Patty's around,
you completely lose yourself,

13:38.151 --> 13:39.902
and it's getting real old, real fast.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.741
Don't ask me to choose
between you and Patty, you'll lose.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.412
Hey, Bob.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
What's going on? Why are you on the floor?

13:54.000 --> 13:58.421
I, um... started meditating at lunch
to calm my nerves.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.923
See?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.807
Okay, whatever.
We have to cancel the roast.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.267
What roast?

14:11.351 --> 14:14.187
Patty is having a roast for her birthday

14:14.520 --> 14:16.814
to raise money for Dixie's wheelchair.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.609
Why a roast? Seems a little sophisticated.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.070
We needed entertainment
so we could charge admission.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.155
Bob says that to make amends,

14:24.238 --> 14:27.867
I need to face the truth
and lay myself bare in public.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.869
Oh, is that what he says?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.830
I think it's a horrible idea.
I mean, everybody already hates me.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.542
- Once they hear more bad stuff about me...
- No, I actually agree with Bob.

14:36.626 --> 14:40.004
I think it's freeing
to lean into your truth,

14:40.088 --> 14:43.257
and I also think it's commendable
that you're trying to make things right.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.676
Why don't you use my house for your roast?

14:45.760 --> 14:46.928
- Seriously?
- Really?

14:47.011 --> 14:49.222
Well, I got this big empty house, why not?

14:49.639 --> 14:50.556
Thanks.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.474
My pleasure.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.479
Wait, sorry.
Why are you guys acting like... friends?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.189
We're not.

14:58.272 --> 15:02.860
But since we have a location,
you can go to work on those fliers.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.029
Go now, go!

15:06.614 --> 15:07.448
That was close.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.827
- It was too close.
- Bob, you're being paranoid.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.747
Paranoid?
I don't know how you stay so calm.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.166
Sneaking around, living a double life.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.669
I'm juggling more balls
than I can handle.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.423
- Shit. Now Coralee needs me.
- Hey, Bob. Compartmentalize.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.716
Balls up. Go.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.010
- Call me later.
- Thanks... for everything.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.430
Well, look at us.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.057
Just like a real couple.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.531
Did somebody die?

15:48.781 --> 15:52.326
No. I've been racking my brain all day,

15:52.410 --> 15:55.371
and I can't think of a good business idea.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.665
<i>This was the emergency?</i>

15:58.749 --> 16:00.960
You have been brainstorming
for just a day.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.213
- You got to give yourself more time.
- I don't have time.

16:04.714 --> 16:09.969
The years are just... passing me by,
and I have nothing to show for them.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.304
That is not true.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.348
You have two beautiful children,
you have WMBS.

16:14.432 --> 16:18.019
And to top it all off,
I got my period today.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.898
Well, at least you are not
going through menopause.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.233
Not helpful, Bob.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.818
Not helpful.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.571
<i>Women are so complicated.</i>

16:28.654 --> 16:31.073
<i>At least Barnard didn't have
so many feelings.</i>

16:37.371 --> 16:41.584
Come on, Coralee.
I will not let you give up on yourself.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.838
Maybe I should just forget about it
and focus on our marriage.

16:46.005 --> 16:46.964
No!

16:47.757 --> 16:48.591
Yes.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.427
Oh, I am such a failure.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.680
I can't even find my own
tampon string right now.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.142
Oh, my God, it happens every damn month.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.186
Where the hell is it?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.897
I mean, there's only
so many places it could be.

17:02.980 --> 17:07.443
It's like going on some fucking
impossible fishing expedition.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.819
You'd think by now I could do this.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.990
Oh, for God's sake.
Just put a ring on it or something.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.201
It is just a tampon.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.954
- That's it.
- What's it?

17:20.330 --> 17:24.001
The annoying everyday problem
that I am going to fix.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.881
I am gonna create and market a tampon

17:28.965 --> 17:31.842
with a ring and a tassel off the end of it

17:31.926 --> 17:34.554
so women never lose their string.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.392
I'm telling you, Bob. Every woman
has had to deal with this problem.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.893
I have never heard about that.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.311
Well, why would you?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.814
Trust me, this is a great idea.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.067
All I have to do is come up
with a catchy name,

17:48.150 --> 17:49.944
and then I can look for investors.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.823
I have work to do. Thanks for your help.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.834
Uh...

18:05.876 --> 18:07.253
I should have listened to you

18:07.336 --> 18:09.839
when you said you wanted to quit pageants.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.466
Mags, I had no idea

18:12.550 --> 18:17.054
that you were so miserable
you wanted to kill yourself.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.432
That's not why I OD'd.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.310
I was there, listening from the kitchen

18:22.393 --> 18:25.730
when you threw me under the bus
for cheating at Miss Magic Jesus.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.236
Magnolia...

18:34.572 --> 18:39.910
I am so... so sorry.

18:41.495 --> 18:45.166
I'll call the pageant board.
I'll tell 'em it was my idea.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.210
How could you not tell me I had a sister?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.964
And don't even get me started
about you betraying Mom.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.800
You've been lying to both of us
my entire life.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.968
You're right.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.056
How am I ever supposed to be able
to trust you again?

19:00.723 --> 19:03.184
How do I know that you don't have
a million other dirty secrets that...

19:03.267 --> 19:05.144
I'm gay.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.900
You told Magnolia?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.527
Not about us, about me.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.155
What happened to compartmentalizing?

19:16.238 --> 19:19.659
It's because of my lies
that she's in that place,

19:19.742 --> 19:22.578
and I can't keep up
with all the lies anymore.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.580
Ever since I told you,
I just want to be honest.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.706
I want to let it all out.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.041
No, no, keep it in!

19:27.124 --> 19:30.920
Magnolia was so angry with me
that I told her before Etta Mae,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.089
and I tried to explain to her
I just wanted to wait...

19:33.172 --> 19:35.132
What, you wanna tell Etta Mae?

19:35.216 --> 19:38.135
Not until she gets back from Haiti.
She should hear it in person.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.721
I thought what they don't know
can't hurt 'em.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.681
I was wrong.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.392
And I don't wanna keep
making things worse.

19:44.850 --> 19:49.647
- I got to come clean about me, about us.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:49.730 --> 19:50.940
About us?

19:52.316 --> 19:53.734
I want to be a couple.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.653
I'm tired of being in the closet.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.531
I am not. This is all new to me.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.866
It didn't even occur to me
that I was bisexual.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.368
Gay.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.955
I'm pretty sure gay men don't like
having sex with women, which I do.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.123
I do too.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.791
They're soft.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.669
They're like pillows filled
with marshmallows.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.462
They are soft, aren't they?

20:13.546 --> 20:14.422
Yeah.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.052
Wait, so you are bisexual.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.722
No, that's not how I identify.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.057
I'm gay, emotionally.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.892
And I'm pretty sure you are, too.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.687
Don't tell me what I am
and don't tell anyone else.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.648
Look, all right, fine. I'm sorry.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.025
Okay? You're right.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.780
Can you stay the night?
I don't want to be alone.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.241
Oh. I can't. Coralee.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.619
Just tell her you're working late.
She won't suspect a thing.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.665
<i>I thought we were compartmentalizing,</i>

20:49.749 --> 20:52.126
<i>but now Barnard was changing the rules.</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:54.754
<i>I was scared who else he'd tell
if I didn't stay,</i>

20:54.837 --> 20:56.922
<i>and I had to keep up my own double life.</i>

21:06.182 --> 21:10.102
<i>I couldn't believe Barnard had been
doing this for more than two decades.</i>

21:10.728 --> 21:14.732
<i>It had only been two days,
and the guilt was tearing me apart.</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:18.694
<i>The closet used to be my safe place,</i>

21:18.778 --> 21:20.613
<i>but lately,
it was feeling more and more...</i>

21:20.696 --> 21:22.656
- Another late night?
<i>- ...dangerous.</i>

21:23.324 --> 21:24.408
What time did you get in?

21:24.492 --> 21:27.203
Oh, just now. I'm sorry, did I wake you?

21:27.411 --> 21:29.079
No, Bob Barnard did.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.541
He's called twice in the last two minutes.
It must be important.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.920
Oh, we were working late
on that case again.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.254
It's very confidential.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.215
Did you see any of these texts?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.091
Just the naked ones.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.781
FYI, I also made this an event
on Facebook.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.699
- Thanks.
- And Dee's not coming.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.536
We're not talking.
She was way out of line.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.913
I'm sorry. I know you really like her.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.834
Yeah, but nobody comes betweenÂ me
and my best friend.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.256
Come to Patty's 18th birthday party.
Help Dixie Sinclair buy a new wheelchair.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.799
Are you gonna throw her out
of this one, too?

22:21.882 --> 22:23.175
Suck it, geek.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.469
Patty. You're trying to get people
to like you again.

22:25.553 --> 22:29.223
That's funny.
Okay, I'll see you at the party then.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.558
Okay.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.353
Oh, my God, you know how I get
when I'm backed into a corner.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.606
What if people hate me even more?
What if I lose my shit?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.525
You better not light anybody on fire.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.193
In a few days,
you can be tried as an adult.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.573
Hey, Bob.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.783
Stay away from Christian,
do you understand?

22:47.867 --> 22:48.993
Why, what's wrong?

22:49.076 --> 22:50.619
<i>I heard back from Bob Barnard.</i>

22:50.703 --> 22:54.206
Christian was arrested for trying
to kidnap his girlfriend in Brazil.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.166
<i>They only reason they didn't press charges
is 'cause Pastor Mike</i>

22:56.250 --> 22:57.918
agreed to take his family out
of the country.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.461
That's really bad.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.173
Christian kidnapped a girl in Brazil.
They only...

23:05.009 --> 23:06.176
Bob, I gotta go.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.345
Hey, Patty.
Haven't you been getting my texts?

23:08.429 --> 23:10.222
I haven't heard from you
since the exorcism.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.100
Yeah, there was no demon,
so turns out it was all me.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.101
Even better.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.146
No, pretty sure that means
I'm a bad person.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.025
Isn't your dad having surgery
from the car accident?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.067
Yeah, on his leg.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.986
- So shouldn't you be there?
- Why?

23:24.278 --> 23:25.487
It's not like I can scrub in.

23:26.906 --> 23:27.781
What are these?

23:33.037 --> 23:34.955
You planned a birthday party
without inviting me?

23:35.414 --> 23:39.376
Technically, it's a roast,
and anyone can come.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.961
So technically everyone's invited.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.590
But I had something special planned
for just the two of us, alone.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.759
She doesn't want to be alone with you.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.721
That's not true.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.097
Right, baby?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.058
I know about the kidnapping in Brazil.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.938
And I think we should stop
seeing each other.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.482
I can't believe
you were checking up on me.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.733
Whoa, dude, relax.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.194
It wasn't a kidnapping.
We took off, like you and I did.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.571
Her parents blew the whole thing
totally out of proportion.

24:07.655 --> 24:08.948
Seriously, back off.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.283
Hey!

24:11.659 --> 24:13.285
- Don't...
- You can't just walk away from me.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.913
- Let go!
- Hey, you heard her, asshole. Let go!

24:17.706 --> 24:19.750
Whatever. It's your birthday.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.919
Do what you want. Watch your back.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.421
Oh, babe.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.508
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.969
Thank you for stepping in.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.929
Yeah, I'm just glad you guys are okay.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.097
Happy birthday.

24:34.098 --> 24:34.974
Brick.

24:37.101 --> 24:41.271
Look, I'm... I'm sorry about everything,

24:41.355 --> 24:44.984
and I'm having a party if you wanna come.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.278
I have plans, but I'll try to make it.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.495
Wow. Talk about choosing the wrong guy.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.669
Well, don't you look nice.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.379
What's the occasion?

25:05.462 --> 25:07.047
It's Patty's birthday party.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.049
And I'm not invited?

25:09.800 --> 25:15.556
Well, I mean, you and Patty really
haven't spoken since you left town.

25:16.557 --> 25:20.894
Yeah, but I should still go, right?
I mean, show that our marriage is strong.

25:20.978 --> 25:24.398
Plus, it's not even really a party,
it's more of a charity roast.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.735
Oh, now I definitely wanna come.

25:27.818 --> 25:31.321
Everyone in town is talking about
what a bully Patty is.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.574
What do you wear to a bloodbath?

25:33.657 --> 25:36.660
<i>With Bob Barnard wanting
to kick out his closet door,</i>

25:36.744 --> 25:39.455
<i>I couldn't risk putting Coralee
in the line of fire.</i>

25:39.538 --> 25:40.497
Are you sure?

25:40.581 --> 25:44.001
All the proceeds are going towards
a new wheelchair for Dixie Sinclair,

25:44.084 --> 25:46.587
and I know how you feel about Regina.

25:46.754 --> 25:51.133
No, it's important for me
to be there for you.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.593
Where is it?

25:53.927 --> 25:55.804
At Bob Barnard's.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.228
Since when do you double fist?

26:03.729 --> 26:06.023
- Excuse me?
- The wine, Bob.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.858
Are you nervous about something?

26:07.941 --> 26:09.860
Oh. No. I'm just...

26:10.152 --> 26:11.320
Bob Barnard.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.572
Hey. Oh!

26:13.655 --> 26:15.449
Well, you're lucky you have a beard

26:15.741 --> 26:18.160
that will catch the dribble
and crumbs and such.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.831
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- And you look dazzling as always, Coralee.

26:23.082 --> 26:23.916
Dazzling.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.293
Oh, my God, that's it.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.463
Tampazzle.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.925
Ooh, ooh! I gotta write that down
so I do not forget it.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.177
What the hell is a Tampazzle?

26:35.260 --> 26:37.596
It's a tampon with a tassel. Don't ask.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.390
What are you thinking making jokes
like that in front of my wife?

26:40.474 --> 26:43.852
Oh, I always make fun of you.
We need to keep up appearances.

26:43.936 --> 26:47.356
Oh, my God.
There's an actual line out the front door.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.151
Well, that's the most front-door action
this place has seen in days.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.861
I'll go help things along.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.409
So, how are you feeling?

26:59.493 --> 27:01.036
Just trying to be brave, like you said.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.371
Good girl.

27:03.038 --> 27:06.959
Now is the time for your birthday gift.

27:07.918 --> 27:08.877
You didn't have to.

27:10.129 --> 27:14.883
It is a bee to remind you
to be the most you you can be.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.469
- Cute.
- Hey, Patty.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.138
Brick, you came.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.890
Yeah. Well, I got a ride
with my parents, so...

27:22.391 --> 27:23.308
Happy birthday.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.355
He is trying to play it cool,
but he changed his shirt three times

27:28.438 --> 27:30.315
before we left the house. Now, come on.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.068
Let's go over your final notes,
make sure you don't sting anybody.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.160
Dee? What are you doing here?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.036
I wanted to apologize.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.873
I'm sorry about what I said about Patty.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.793
I know she's your best friend,
so I wanted to show my support.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.212
Thanks.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.007
Plus, I couldn't miss a chance
to hear people talk shit about her.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.429
I'm sorry, Tampoozle?

28:00.512 --> 28:03.891
No, not a Tampoozle, like bamboozle.

28:03.974 --> 28:07.269
Tampazzle, like razzle-dazzle.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.230
Oh, you know what?
Here, I'm gonna show you guys.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.773
Who's carrying?

28:11.857 --> 28:12.774
I got one.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.613
Anyone else?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.823
Please, God, anyone else?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.534
Here, hold this.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.078
Thank you.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.747
So, here you go.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.707
Like, we've all been there, right?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.125
Like we're deep sea fishing?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.543
You know, sometimes you're, like,

28:31.627 --> 28:33.837
digging for treasure,
trying to find this string.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.590
Here, can you hold that? Okay.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.176
Now watch this. Okay.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.470
Here we go.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.099
Tampazzle.

28:49.019 --> 28:51.521
It's festive, period.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.816
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
That's an amazing slogan.

28:56.151 --> 29:00.072
Okay. You know what?
Don't you look at me like that.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.325
I mean, if it wasn't for periods,
none of y'all would be here.

29:03.909 --> 29:07.204
I think your idea is genius.

29:07.287 --> 29:10.165
- Oh, that makes me hate it a little bit.
- I can help you.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.417
I still have all
of my real estate contacts.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.878
I can make a list of investors
a mile long.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.130
Do you know what else is a mile long?

29:17.506 --> 29:18.632
Your rap sheet.

29:37.401 --> 29:40.279
Gordy. What the hell are you doing here?

29:40.362 --> 29:43.240
I came to see you.
Saw the party on your Facebook page,

29:43.323 --> 29:46.201
figured I'd come and... we'd catch up.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.913
What's it been, baby, 19 years?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.417
You need to leave. Now.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.460
If you didn't wanna see me,
why'd you reach out?

29:56.461 --> 29:59.673
I don't know. I was... I was confused.

29:59.965 --> 30:00.841
About what?

30:04.469 --> 30:05.721
I've been thinking...

30:06.596 --> 30:08.849
about what happened between us, and...

30:11.643 --> 30:12.644
I think it was wrong.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.732
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you were 26.

30:17.774 --> 30:21.236
You were dating my mom. I was 14.

30:21.611 --> 30:25.657
I realize the circumstances
were not ideal, but...

30:28.952 --> 30:29.995
we were in love.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.788
I don't think that's what love is.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.708
You were supposed to be
a father figure to me.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.625
I was just a kid.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.211
You weren't a kid when you came back
to find me all grown up.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.838
Yeah, and that was fucked up.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.549
Everything I did after you was fucked up.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.968
It's like I got stuck at 14.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.555
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't you go blaming
all your problems on me, okay?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.390
You sound like you're having
a mid-life crisis.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.100
Excuse me.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.227
Guys aren't paying attention to you
like they used to.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.522
You're feeling a little long in the tooth.
I can't blame you.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.317
You're old enough
to have a teenage daughter.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.570
Where is she, by the way?
I wanna wish her a happy birthday.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.365
Well, look at her.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.743
She's a fox, just like you
when you were her age.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.203
You know what?

31:12.996 --> 31:14.247
I did miss you.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.210
Do you still keep that stash of pot
in Kitty's glovebox?

31:19.336 --> 31:20.379
I sure do.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.672
Hmm. Why don't you give me five minutes
to freshen up,

31:22.756 --> 31:26.093
score me some condoms,
and I'll meet you out front?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.573
Howdy, Officer.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.992
I got a tip you may be
carrying some drugs.

31:51.743 --> 31:52.744
Mind if I take a look?

31:57.332 --> 31:59.000
Son of a...

32:00.127 --> 32:01.795
<i>The roasting throne.</i>

32:01.878 --> 32:03.213
<i>I felt like it was taunting me.</i>

32:03.672 --> 32:06.174
<i>I may as well have been going
to the electric chair.</i>

32:06.258 --> 32:08.802
Patty, I was gonna wait
to give you your gift,

32:08.885 --> 32:10.679
but I wanna give it to you now.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.143
You're giving me your car?

32:16.226 --> 32:18.186
I want you to get out
of this town someday,

32:18.270 --> 32:20.605
see new places, do amazing things.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.649
Things I never got to do.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.943
It's never too late
for a fresh start, baby.

32:25.485 --> 32:30.073
Which is...
Which is why I got to get out of here.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.451
What, now? But the roast...

32:32.534 --> 32:34.411
I have to leave
while everyone's distracted.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.538
I'm skipping town for a while.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.873
It's time to grow up.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.042
You and me, we can both be adults.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.086
So, what are you gonna do?

32:43.420 --> 32:45.046
Don't worry about that, baby.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.882
I'll call you as soon as I can.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.592
I love you.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.220
Happy birthday.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.101
Ready to get roasted?

33:15.243 --> 33:17.996
<i>Thank you all so much for coming</i>

33:18.079 --> 33:21.500
<i>and helping to buy Dixie Sinclair
a new set of wheels.</i>

33:25.921 --> 33:30.425
And to help roast Patty Bladell alive.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.805
So, here is how tonight is going to work.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.724
Anyone who wants to come up

33:37.807 --> 33:41.228
and speak the truth about Patty
is welcome.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.063
But be warned.

33:43.146 --> 33:47.776
When you're done, Patty will get
the chance to do the same to you.

33:48.235 --> 33:52.197
And if there's one thing
Patty loves more than a buffet,

33:52.447 --> 33:53.573
it's revenge.

33:56.117 --> 34:00.330
Just ask Dixie Sinclair, am I right?

34:00.580 --> 34:04.084
Okay, so, let's get this party started.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.962
<i>I felt like a lamb getting led
to slaughter.</i>

34:07.045 --> 34:08.295
<i>I braced for the worst.</i>

34:08.505 --> 34:10.005
I knew Patty wasn't much of an athlete

34:10.090 --> 34:12.926
when we had to run the 50-yard dash
in third grade.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.803
She crossed the finish line in sixth.

34:17.472 --> 34:20.433
<i>That wasn't so bad.
And who knew Brick had a sense of humor?</i>

34:21.016 --> 34:23.603
I love Patty.
She's like a second daughter to me.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.398
But with her around,
I also gained a son...

34:27.232 --> 34:28.567
the Domino's delivery guy.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.279
I love pizza. I love pizza.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.947
Patty totally flashed me her boobs once
at the Booze 'N Stuff.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.366
Oh, way to go, man.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.036
And what's the punch line?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.831
No punch line.
I just wanted everyone to know.

34:43.623 --> 34:47.585
Dixie used to be
Bob Armstrong's shining star,

34:47.668 --> 34:50.589
but he traded her in for a cheaper model.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.302
Oh, honey, don't you know
everything good comes from China?

34:58.179 --> 35:00.181
Growing up,
I had a lot of nicknames for Patty.

35:00.807 --> 35:05.562
Porky, Chunky Brewster,
Blubberguts, Big Gob,

35:05.645 --> 35:09.107
Butterball, Lard Bucket, Tub o' Chitlins.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.984
Okay, okay, I get it.

35:11.067 --> 35:11.985
I was fat.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.487
I was building to...

35:15.280 --> 35:16.156
you're a slut.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.535
<i>It was brutal.</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:21.745
Burn.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.039
<i>Thank God Nonnie
was the last person to go.</i>

35:24.122 --> 35:27.167
<i>At least I knew I had already heard
anything she would have to say.</i>

35:27.834 --> 35:32.172
Being best friends with Patty Bladell
is not for the weak of heart or stomach.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.133
She once made me eat
so much sugar-free chocolate,

35:35.216 --> 35:36.384
I crapped my pants.

35:38.345 --> 35:42.807
Oh, also, she once made me drive ten miles
in an ice storm to get donuts.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.935
And she made me help her
steal police evidence.

35:46.978 --> 35:47.812
Sorry, Dad.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.899
Oh, and she made me conjure a demon.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.242
Wow.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.164
I can't believe all the crazy shit
you've made me do.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.303
Hey, wait, Nonnie.

36:21.137 --> 36:25.767
Well, on that note,
let us all take a brief intermission.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.187
Wait, wait, wait, Nonnie.
Hey, hey, Nonnie.

36:30.146 --> 36:33.900
I am so sorry for making you do all
of those things.

36:33.983 --> 36:34.984
You didn't.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.113
You didn't force me to
or put a gun to my head. It's on me.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.573
What do you mean?

36:40.865 --> 36:43.368
I mean, I don't think for myself
when I'm with you.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.912
I lose who I am...

36:46.663 --> 36:49.416
and I don't wanna lose
my girlfriend over it, so I got to go.

36:49.499 --> 36:52.043
Wait, Nonnie... Hey, wait.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.380
- We need to finish this conversation.
- No, we don't.

36:56.589 --> 37:01.803
I'm sorry, Patty... but this friendship
isn't working for me anymore.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.390
I need to take a break.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.894
<i>It was the worst birthday ever.</i>

37:09.978 --> 37:12.772
<i>I lost my Mom, my best friend.</i>

37:12.856 --> 37:17.235
<i>All I had left was Bob,
and I needed to find him ASAP.</i>

37:19.529 --> 37:22.782
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

37:22.866 --> 37:26.661
Well, Coralee was just thanking me
for being so supportive

37:26.745 --> 37:28.872
while you went through your rough patch.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.957
You know what? Let's toast.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.169
To Bob Barnard, the man
who may have saved our marriage.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.212
Oh!

37:36.296 --> 37:38.631
Okay, sugar. Do you have a dustpan?

37:38.715 --> 37:39.883
Oh, in the mud room.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.597
- I can't do this. I am not like you.
- You can.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.183
We just need to get you through the night
without you falling apart.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.851
Me? What about you?

37:50.059 --> 37:52.145
Who knows who you may come out to next?

37:52.228 --> 37:54.272
Oh, my God.

37:54.355 --> 37:58.276
I'm dizzy. I can't feel my hands.
Oh, my God. I can't breathe.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.947
Oh, my God, you have to stand up.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.159
Hey, you need to calm down.
You gotta calm down.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.953
I know what you need. Come on.

38:10.205 --> 38:13.583
Mm-hmm. Just breathe. Just breathe.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.502
And let go.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.549
Oh, stop. I can't live like this.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.135
You're better at it than you think.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.312
<i>What the fuck?</i>

38:34.395 --> 38:39.275
<i>Bob said the truth would set me free,
and he was keeping secrets all along?</i>

38:39.776 --> 38:42.862
<i>I had been humiliated, abandoned.</i>

38:42.946 --> 38:45.240
<i>All because I trusted him.</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:47.283
<i>And now, I was gonna make him pay.</i>

38:48.910 --> 38:50.495
Intermission's over, folks.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.580
Let's just skip right to the end.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.835
Oh, look, our MC has decided to join us.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.712
Hey, Bob. Where were you?

38:59.796 --> 39:01.714
Oh, sorry, bathroom.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.468
Well, I just wanna start
by thanking everyone

39:05.552 --> 39:07.804
for their brutal honesty tonight.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.140
Who doesn't need a little more truth
in their life?

39:14.060 --> 39:16.813
That's what tonight
is all about, right, Bob?

39:17.272 --> 39:18.147
The truth?

39:18.898 --> 39:24.112
See, Bob is always telling me that
I should be the most me that I can be.

39:25.071 --> 39:28.366
Just really live in my truth.

39:29.534 --> 39:34.247
But I think that everyone
should walk the walk and talk the talk.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.666
So come on, Bob.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.460
You have any secrets
you wanna share with the group?

39:43.339 --> 39:44.173
Come on.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.342
Be the most you you can be.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.554
You wanna tell Coralee,
or do you want me to?

39:50.930 --> 39:53.391
Bob, what is she talking about?

39:53.474 --> 39:55.018
I have no idea.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.436
He's boning Bob Barnard.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.149
- Oh!
- What?

40:02.859 --> 40:05.236
That's ridiculous. I would never...

40:05.320 --> 40:06.696
Oh, you would never what?

40:07.530 --> 40:08.364
Lie?

40:09.407 --> 40:12.243
While telling everyone else to be honest?

40:12.327 --> 40:16.497
Or you would never be a fraud
while telling me to be authentic?

40:16.831 --> 40:20.752
Or you would never betray the trust
of everyone you know?

40:25.715 --> 40:27.842
I mean, that's not true, is it, Bob?

40:35.099 --> 40:37.352
What? Why are you looking at him?

40:41.606 --> 40:42.690
Oh, my God.

40:44.859 --> 40:45.902
Oh, my God.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.572
Coralee, please.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.115
Please don't leave.

40:51.366 --> 40:54.243
No, I'm not leaving this time, Bob.

40:55.703 --> 40:56.537
You are.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.501
Don't come home... ever.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.970
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
- Oh, it's hot! It's hot!

41:15.390 --> 41:18.142
I can walk again!
Praise Jesus, it's a miracle!

41:18.226 --> 41:19.394
It's a miracle.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.688
See, everyone is a liar except me.

41:32.615 --> 41:35.660
Why did you do that to me,
after everything I've done for you?

41:35.743 --> 41:38.663
Done for me? You humiliated me!

41:39.122 --> 41:41.708
You made me listen to all that ugliness,

41:41.791 --> 41:45.086
telling me to be brave
when you're a coward!

41:45.253 --> 41:50.633
I wanted to handle things the right way,
which you have now made impossible!

41:51.009 --> 41:54.929
I did you a favor and laid you bare,
just like you did to me.

41:55.471 --> 41:59.017
And how does it feel, huh?
Don't you feel free?

42:00.226 --> 42:01.227
You know what?

42:01.561 --> 42:02.770
You are right.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.606
I never should have thought
because you were beautiful

42:05.690 --> 42:08.860
that your insides matched your outsides.

42:09.068 --> 42:13.740
Please don't be the most you you can be,

42:13.823 --> 42:18.161
because who you are... is ugly.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.214
<i>Bob told me I had
to face my truth,</i>

42:30.298 --> 42:32.633
<i>and now it was all too clear.</i>

42:34.260 --> 42:36.763
<i>I was selfish, destructive,</i>

42:36.846 --> 42:39.682
<i>and so caught up
in my own self-righteous anger</i>

42:39.766 --> 42:43.394
<i>that I didn't think about how my actions
would affect anyone else.</i>

42:43.978 --> 42:47.065
<i>Bob was right, I was ugly on the inside,</i>

42:47.148 --> 42:49.817
<i>so it didn't matter
what my outsides looked like.</i>

42:50.026 --> 42:51.152
<i>Not anymore.</i>

42:51.486 --> 42:52.904
<i>So who cared what I ate?</i>

42:52.987 --> 42:55.323
<i>I just didn't want to feel this pain.</i>

42:55.531 --> 43:01.037
<i>I didn't want to feel anything at all,
so I turned to the only friend I had left.</i>

43:03.206 --> 43:05.041
<i>Happy birthday, Fatty Patty.</i>

43:06.305 --> 43:12.560
