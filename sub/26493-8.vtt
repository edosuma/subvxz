00:00.100 --> 00:02.091
PREVIOUSLY ON
"ALL AMERICAN"...

00:02.100 --> 00:03.090
WHAT YOU DOING?

00:03.100 --> 00:04.090
COLLECTING MY PAPER.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.090
ALVIN KNOW ABOUT THIS?

00:05.100 --> 00:06.898
NAH. NOBODY GONNA
ROB ALVIN.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.994
BONEZ: WE AIN'T HERE
FOR NO HAIRCUT,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.833
BUT WE DEFINITELY
GONNA TAKE A CUT.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.409
TYRONE: THERE'S A LOT
OF HEAT ON US RIGHT NOW

00:15.410 --> 00:17.003
'CAUSE THAT MESS
YOU MADE AT ALVIN'S.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.080
SO, NOW YOU GONNA
TAKE OVER

00:18.080 --> 00:19.070
AND SELL OUR DOPE
ON HIS BLOCK.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.013
NO PROBLEM.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.579
DON'T WORRY.
I GOT YOU, ALL RIGHT?

00:21.580 --> 00:23.287
TYRONE, HE'LL
NEVER KNOW.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.689
I TOLD SHAWN THAT
I WOULD HANDLE IT.

00:24.690 --> 00:25.816
THIS IS ON ME.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.117
I DON'T CARRY NOBODY,

00:27.120 --> 00:29.111
SO, YOU AND YOUR BOY SHAWN,
WATCH YOUR BACK.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.428
I'M SO SORRY.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.955
IT'S NOT GONNA
WORK ANYMORE.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.893
TELL HER, OLIVIA.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.527
TELL YOUR BEST FRIEND
HOW WE HAD SEX

00:34.530 --> 00:36.521
WAY BEFORE SPENCER
SHOWED UP ON THE SCENE.

00:36.530 --> 00:37.725
I'M SUSPENDING YOU
FOR THE NEXT TWO GAMES.

00:37.730 --> 00:38.891
TOMORROW'S HOMECOMING.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.436
SCOUTS ARE GONNA BE
AT THAT GAME.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.909
I HAVE TO PLAY. PLEASE
DO NOT DO THIS TO ME.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.059
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:44.070 --> 00:45.708
I NEED TO BOOK IT HOME OR
MY DAD'S GONNA KILL ME.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.109
YEAH, AND I SAY THAT
YOU JUST NEED TO LOOSEN UP.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.602
AREN'T YOU ALWAYS TIRED
OF DOING WHAT'S RIGHT?

00:49.610 --> 00:51.044
LISTEN, I KNOW YOUR
FEELINGS FOR ASHER

00:51.050 --> 00:52.848
WON'T JUST GO AWAY BECAUSE
YOU GOT FEELINGS FOR ME.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.670
AS MUCH AS I WANT TO
BE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW--

00:54.680 --> 00:56.682
AND, BELIEVE ME,
I DO--

00:56.690 --> 00:59.512
THE LAST THING YOU NEED
IS ANYTHING COMPLICATED.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.854
MAN: WHEN THE SKY IS FALLING

01:02.860 --> 01:06.160
I WILL PICK IT UP AGAIN

01:06.160 --> 01:11.064
IF I HEAR YOU CALLING,
I WILL BE THE ONE TO STAND

01:11.070 --> 01:14.529
I WON'T GIVE UP,
WON'T GIVE UP

01:14.540 --> 01:19.671
WON'T GIVE UP
TO FIND A BETTER WAY

01:36.390 --> 01:38.085
SOME RIDE YOU GOT.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.426
YOU'RE HERE.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.626
DAMN RIGHT I'M HERE.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.730
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT THING YOU

01:48.740 --> 01:50.230
HAD TO TAKE CARE
OF TONIGHT?

01:50.240 --> 01:52.436
GETTING SHAWN FROM OUT
UNDER THE GANG AND ALL?

01:52.440 --> 01:54.135
SOME THINGS, HMM,

01:54.140 --> 01:56.848
JUST DON'T WORK OUT
AS YOU HAD PLANNED.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.000
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU
AND YOUR GIRL, THOUGH?

01:59.010 --> 02:00.148
HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?

02:00.150 --> 02:01.675
LIKE YOU SAID.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.047
SOME THINGS DON'T
WORK OUT LIKE WE PLAN.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.549
HELL OF A NIGHT, RIGHT?

02:07.560 --> 02:09.358
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.884
YOU SURE YOU'RE GOOD?

02:12.590 --> 02:14.058
AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.602
I WANT BETTER
FOR YOU, COOP.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.633
YOU'RE MY PEOPLE.
ALL RIGHT?

02:28.640 --> 02:31.007
YOU'RE FAMILY TO ME.

02:31.010 --> 02:33.149
I'M NOT EVER GONNA
LEAVE YOU BEHIND.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.739
NO MATTER WHAT.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.119
I KNOW YOU WON'T.

02:52.670 --> 02:55.059
DILLON: OH,
THAT BOY'S A MESS.

02:55.070 --> 02:56.663
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

02:56.670 --> 02:57.660
ASHER ON VIDEO:
TELL YOUR BEST FRIEND

02:57.670 --> 02:58.865
HOW WE HAD SEX WAY BEFORE

02:58.870 --> 02:59.871
SPENCER SHOWED UP ON THE SCENE.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.972
TELL HER!
GO AHEAD!

03:00.980 --> 03:02.232
GRACE: HOW MANY
TIMES Y'ALL GONNA

03:02.240 --> 03:04.004
WATCH THAT
DAMN VIDEO?

03:04.010 --> 03:05.307
ENOUGH.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.414
COME ON!

03:06.420 --> 03:08.514
MOM, IT'S EPIC.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.549
WHAT'S WRONG,
BABY?

03:14.560 --> 03:17.325
IT'S MY FAULT.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.820
YOUR FAULT?

03:18.830 --> 03:20.491
LOOK, IF I NEVER
LEFT SOUTH CRENSHAW,

03:20.500 --> 03:22.093
NEVER UPPED AND MOVED
TO BEVERLY HILLS,

03:22.100 --> 03:23.693
NONE OF THIS MESS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.065
HOW IS THAT
EXACTLY?

03:25.070 --> 03:27.164
IF I'D HAVE STAYED,
COOP WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT UP

03:27.170 --> 03:29.696
WITH SHAWN AND A BUNCH
OF GANGBANGERS.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.338
JORDAN AND COACH
WOULDN'T BE STRUGGLING

03:31.340 --> 03:32.660
TO CONNECT ALL THE TIME,

03:32.670 --> 03:34.069
<i>AND ASHER WOULDN'T BE
BENCHED FOR HOMECOMING.</i>

03:34.080 --> 03:35.707
AND HE'D STILL
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.747
THANKS FOR THE INPUT,
LITTLE MAN.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.548
JUST CALLING IT
HOW I SEE IT.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.847
GRACE: YOU CANNOT
TAKE THE BLAME

03:40.850 --> 03:42.909
FOR OTHER
PEOPLE'S CHOICES.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.514
I MADE A LOT OF BAD
CHOICES IN MY LIFE,

03:45.520 --> 03:47.158
AND I OWN THEM.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.152
THEY DON'T BELONG
TO NOBODY ELSE.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.892
BUT THIS CHOICE--
GOING TO BEVERLY--

03:53.900 --> 03:56.255
YOU MADE THE RIGHT
DECISION FOR YOU,

03:56.260 --> 03:57.466
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.939
THAT'S ALL ANY ONE
OF US CAN CONTROL.

04:02.470 --> 04:03.938
RIGHT, BABY?

04:06.140 --> 04:07.869
MAN: YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO THAT

04:07.880 --> 04:09.336
THE EAGLES NEED ASHER
ON THAT FIELD TONIGHT.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.479
THERE'S NO WAY HE'S RIDING
THE BENCH FOR THIS GAME.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.039
HAROLD, I DON'T
LIKE SITTING OUT

04:13.050 --> 04:15.610
MY STARTING WIDE RECEIVER
ON HOMECOMING, EITHER.

04:15.620 --> 04:17.178
IT PUTS ME
AT A DISADVANTAGE,

04:17.190 --> 04:19.339
A DISADVANTAGE
THAT I CANNOT AFFORD.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.887
BUT YOUR SON, HE WAS
DRINKING ON SCHOOL PROPERTY.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.619
MADE A BIG SCENE
AT THE DANCE LAST NIGHT,

04:23.630 --> 04:25.724
AND THERE ARE
CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT.

04:25.730 --> 04:26.754
IS THAT RIGHT?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.319
I'M AFRAID IT IS.

04:30.930 --> 04:34.298
I'M NOT GONNA
LET THIS STAND.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.203
YOU MARK MY WORDS,
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.205
YOUR DAD'S AN ASS.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.110
HUH. WHAT WAS
THAT ABOUT?

04:48.120 --> 04:51.613
I'll TELL YOU LATER. WHERE
THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

04:51.620 --> 04:53.679
OUT.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.715
ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.188
WHAT? NO.

04:57.190 --> 04:58.680
IN CASE YOU'RE FORGETTING,
I KNOW WHAT

04:58.690 --> 05:00.089
HIGH AS A KITE
LOOKS LIKE.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.829
ARE YOU NUTS?
YOU HAVE A GAME TODAY.

05:01.830 --> 05:02.900
OLIVIA, RELAX.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.164
RELAX? DUDE,
I COVERED FOR YOU.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.399
I TOLD MOM AND DAD
THAT YOU WERE

05:06.400 --> 05:07.663
IN YOUR ROOM
ALL NIGHT.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.229
NOW GET YOUR
CHIP-GUZZLING WALK OF SHAME

05:09.240 --> 05:10.537
BUTT UPSTAIRS BEFORE--

05:10.540 --> 05:13.407
AH. WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

05:13.410 --> 05:16.471
JORDAN: HEY, DAD.
BILLY: HEY.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.005
WHY ARE YOU STILL
IN YOUR SUIT?

05:18.010 --> 05:20.149
AND WHERE ARE
YOUR SHOES?

05:21.980 --> 05:23.243
HEY, PLEASE
DO NOT TELL ME

05:23.250 --> 05:25.787
YOU ARE JUST GETTING IN
FROM LAST NIGHT.

05:25.790 --> 05:29.090
JORDAN: YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW
WHAT? I HAD A GREAT NIGHT.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.081
I--1 FINALLY
LET LOOSE FOR ONCE.

05:31.090 --> 05:31.886
YOU LET LOOSE.

05:31.890 --> 05:32.880
I WOULD STOP NOW.

05:32.890 --> 05:33.960
JORDAN: NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.257
I'M--I'M NOT GONNA
STOP, OK?

05:35.260 --> 05:36.659
I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.069
I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO PLEASE YOU.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.765
-YEAH, YOU.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.329
AND FOR ONCE, I DID
WHAT I WANTED.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.399
WHAT, WITH THIS LITTLE
MALIBU CHEERLEADER?

05:43.410 --> 05:44.468
HER NAME IS
RIPLEY, DAD.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.006
DO YOU THINK THAT
SHE EVEN CARES

05:46.010 --> 05:48.877
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE
DISTRACTED AT TONIGHT'S GAME?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.803
DO YOU THINK SHE CARES
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE OFF

05:50.810 --> 05:52.300
BECAUSE YOUR ASS
WAS OUT ALL NIGHT

05:52.310 --> 05:54.813
COMING UP IN HERE
BAREFOOTED AND DOE-EYED

05:54.820 --> 05:56.640
JUST HOURS
BEFORE KICKOFF?

05:56.650 --> 05:57.720
SHE'S A HIGH SCHOOL
GIRL, OK?

05:57.720 --> 05:58.915
SHE'S NOT
A SECRET AGENT.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.184
I DON'T GIVE A--LOOK.
I KNOW THIS.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.249
I KNOW YOU'RE
TEAM CAPTAIN.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.979
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
LEADING YOUR PLAYERS.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.652
YOU GOT RESPONSIBILITIES
HERE, JACK.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.094
DO YOU NOT WANT THEM?

06:10.100 --> 06:13.638
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
PLEASE JUST LET ME KNOW.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.495
JORDAN, YOU HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT

06:15.500 --> 06:18.765
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
TO YOU.

06:18.770 --> 06:23.310
NOT FOR ME,
NOT FOR THESE GIRLS.

06:23.310 --> 06:26.371
BABY, FOR YOU.
SO, PLEASE FIGURE IT OUT.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.813
SHAWN: WHAT'S IT GONNA
BE THIS MORNING, MAMA?

06:35.820 --> 06:37.686
WANT YOUR
EGGS SCRAMBLED?

06:37.690 --> 06:39.658
I LIKE MINES
OVER EASY.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.855
I WAS TALKING
TO MAYA.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.397
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR
OWN DAMN EGGS, FOOL.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.326
HEY, MAN, YOU'RE NOT
REALLY JUST GONNA

06:46.330 --> 06:48.196
WALK AWAY FROM THAT
JOB WITH J.P., ARE YOU?

06:48.200 --> 06:51.329
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST
GIVE UP, NOT LIKE THIS.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.536
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH
YOU AND YOUR BOY SPENCER.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.100
YOU THINK LIFE'S LIKE
SOME DAMN FAIRY TALE,

06:56.110 --> 06:58.249
LIKE WE ALL GOT SOME
CHANCE AT GREATNESS.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.502
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW
THE WORLD WORK

06:59.510 --> 07:01.114
FOR THE REST OF US.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.145
LOOK, IT DON'T HAVE
TO BE THAT WAY, SHAWN.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.346
YOU CAN'T JUST UP
AND THROW AWAY YOUR DREAM.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.853
NO USE DREAMING WHEN
THE DREAMS AIN'T REAL.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.329
SOMETIMES THE DREAM
IS ALL WE GOT.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.996
OPEN THE DOOR.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.365
ARE YOU EXPECTING
SOMEBODY?

07:19.370 --> 07:20.963
NO.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.859
MAYA: OPEN THE DOOR.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.869
GO PLAY.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.412
WHAT'S UP, TY?
WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

07:36.420 --> 07:39.344
JUST STOPPING BY.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

07:39.350 --> 07:41.114
NAH, MAN.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.758
MY CRIB IS YOUR CRIB.

07:42.760 --> 07:43.921
YEAH, I GOT SOME
EGGS COOKING.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.022
YOU WANT SOME?

07:45.030 --> 07:46.384
NAH, I'M GOOD.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.798
HEY, LITTLE LADY.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.598
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.068
MAYA: AWWI
TYRONE: AWW.

07:55.070 --> 07:56.196
YOU LIKE KITTENS?

07:56.200 --> 07:58.532
ALL LITTLE GIRLS
LIKE KITTENS, RIGHT?

07:58.540 --> 07:59.962
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

08:00.940 --> 08:02.829
IT'S KITTY!

08:02.840 --> 08:04.899
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

08:04.910 --> 08:05.980
THE COPS BEEN ASKING
ABOUT OUR BOY

08:05.980 --> 08:07.641
THAT GOT POPPED
AT ALVIN'S--

08:07.650 --> 08:09.175
THAT HEAT YOU BROUGHT.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.740
SO, UNTIL THAT CLEARS UP,
WE ON LOCKDOWN.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.479
YOU FEEL ME?

08:13.490 --> 08:14.958
YEAH, I'M FEELING YOU.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.282
GET YOUR GIRL
SOME EGGS, MAN.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.327
TAKE CARE OF
YOUR BABY GIRL, SHAWN.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.427
MAYA: EGGS.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.860
[MAYA SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY]

08:27.870 --> 08:29.793
SHAWN: WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.268
REMEMBER WHAT
I TOLD YOU.

08:31.270 --> 08:34.240
YOU AND SHAWN. Y'ALL
BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK,

08:34.240 --> 08:35.878
BECAUSE IF YOU AIN'T
RIDING FOR ME,

08:35.880 --> 08:37.905
I'M COMING FOR Y'ALL--

08:37.909 --> 08:39.571
YOU AND SHAWN.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.827
WELL, HERE HE IS--
TYRONE MOORE.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.252
IT SAYS
HE'S ASSOCIATED

08:54.260 --> 08:55.955
WITH ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS GANGS

08:55.960 --> 08:57.724
IN SOUTH L.A.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.459
HOW ON EARTH DID
YOU GET CAUGHT UP

08:59.470 --> 09:00.494
WITH A GUY
LIKE THIS?

09:00.500 --> 09:01.638
IT'S A LONG STORY.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.892
LOOK, COOP
AND SHAWN,

09:02.900 --> 09:04.038
THEY NEED
PROTECTION.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.838
THEY IN A BAD SPOT,
MRS. BAKER.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.934
GUYS LIKE TYRONE,
THEY DON'T MESS AROUND.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.237
I DON'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO TURN TO.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.278
NO, I'M GLAD YOU
CAME TO ME, SPENCER.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.214
I THINK I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.972
LOOK, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS,

09:15.980 --> 09:18.142
BUT IT SAYS HERE
THAT THE D.A.'S OFFICE

09:18.150 --> 09:21.154
HAS BEEN AFTER TYRONE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.356
IF YOU HAVE
ANY INFORMATION

09:23.360 --> 09:24.486
THAT COULD HELP
WITH THAT,

09:24.490 --> 09:26.254
I'M SURE I CAN
GET THEM TO NEGOTIATE

09:26.260 --> 09:27.694
SOME SORT OF DEAL
SO THAT--

09:27.700 --> 09:29.099
NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING

09:29.100 --> 09:30.170
ABOUT TYRONE.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.992
BUT SHAWN
DOES, RIGHT?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.365
YOU KNOW HE NOT
GOING FOR THAT.

09:34.370 --> 09:37.101
MAYBE NOT, BUT IT'S
WORTH A SHOT, MAN. COME ON.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.339
LAURA: OK, LOOK,

09:38.340 --> 09:40.638

THIS SHAWN GUY

09:40.640 --> 09:42.039

09:42.040 --> 09:43.872
I CAN GET
BOTH OF YOU

09:43.880 --> 09:45.041
THE HELP YOU NEED.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.519
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.664
MAN: IT'S A WONDER DRUG
IF YOU EVER FALL IN LOVE

10:11.670 --> 10:14.002

THERE'S A GOD ABOVE

10:14.010 --> 10:19.369
AND HE'S WATCHING
AND GRINNING, YEAH...

10:21.050 --> 10:22.245

SAID SOME

10:22.250 --> 10:23.843

LAST NIGHT,

10:23.850 --> 10:26.512
AND I AM STILL
MAD AS HELL AT YOU.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.955
I AM SORRY THAT
I SLEPT WITH ASHER,

10:28.960 --> 10:30.655
AND I WILL KEEP
SAYING IT UNTIL--

10:30.660 --> 10:32.128
I GET IT.
YOU WERE HIGH.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.859

THE ASHER THING.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.828
I'M UPSET ABOUT US.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.127
YOU LET ME BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T WANT

10:39.130 --> 10:40.336
TO BE MY FRIEND ANYMORE,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.661
AND YOU LET ME
BE WITH A GUY

10:42.670 --> 10:45.833
WHO WOULD CHEAT ON ME
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.104
I KNOW.
AND IT WAS WRONG.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.499
I TOLD MYSELF THAT
I WAS DOING IT

10:50.510 --> 10:52.171
TO PROTECT YOU,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

10:52.180 --> 10:55.377
I WAS JUST
PROTECTING MYSELF.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.486
EVERYTHING THAT YOU
SAID LAST NIGHT WAS TRUE.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.259
WELL...IF I'M BEING HONEST,

11:03.260 --> 11:06.230
YOU WEREN'T WRONG, EITHER.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.123
I KNEW YOU LIKED
SPENCER,

11:10.130 --> 11:13.327
AND I WAS TOO AFRAID OF
NOT BEING MISS PERFECT

11:13.330 --> 11:15.594

I LIKED HIM, TOO.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.795
I'M SORRY.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.907
YOU--YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE, LEILA, OK?

11:20.910 --> 11:22.674
NOT TO ME,

11:22.680 --> 11:24.170
NOT AFTER
WHAT I DID.

11:24.180 --> 11:28.242
AND...YES, I HAD
A THING FOR SPENCER,

11:28.250 --> 11:31.117
BUT I'M MOVING ON,

11:31.120 --> 11:34.954
AND SPENCER IS A REALLY
GOOD GUY FOR YOU.

YEAH, WELL...

11:36.360 --> 11:37.623
HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY

11:37.630 --> 11:39.485
WHO'S TRYING
TO UNCOMPLICATE MY LIFE

11:39.490 --> 11:43.597
BY SAYING WE SHOULD JUST
BE FRIENDS RIGHT NOW.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.989
PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.640
IS IT?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.529
I DON'T KNOW.

11:50.540 --> 11:51.530

11:51.540 --> 11:53.338

WANT TO LOSE

11:53.340 --> 11:55.172
MY BEST FRIEND AGAIN.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.945
HONESTLY, UM...

11:57.950 --> 12:00.317
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, EITHER.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.573
IT'S GONNA TAKE
SOME TIME.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.243
PRINCIPAL LANDON:
LOOK, HAROLD ADAMS

12:06.250 --> 12:09.379
IS KICKING UP A STORM WITH
THE BOARD, THE BOOSTERS.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.484
LOOK, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD HIM.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.151
WE HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY HERE,

12:13.160 --> 12:15.959
NOT JUST TO WIN BUT
TO TEACH THESE YOUNG BOYS

12:15.960 --> 12:18.622
HOW TO BE BETTER HUMANS.

12:18.630 --> 12:21.793
IF I LET ASH BACK OUT
ON THAT FIELD TONIGHT

12:21.800 --> 12:23.290
AFTER WHAT HE DID,

12:23.300 --> 12:25.507
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF A
LESSON ARE WE TEACHING THEM?

12:25.510 --> 12:26.864
LOOK, I AGREE
WITH YOU.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.201
I'M IN YOUR
CORNER, BILLY.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.302
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW,

12:29.310 --> 12:30.573
IF YOU DON'T PLAY
ASHER ADAMS

12:30.580 --> 12:32.309
AND YOU LOSE TONIGHT,
THE BOARD WILL--

12:32.310 --> 12:33.812
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.049
THEY'LL FIRE ME
NEXT SEASON.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.449
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

12:36.450 --> 12:37.849
BUT MY HANDS ARE
KIND OF TIED HERE.

12:37.850 --> 12:40.615
IF I GIVE IN TO THIS,
TO PARENTS LIKE HAROLD ADAMS,

12:40.620 --> 12:42.782
AND PUT WINNING ABOVE
THESE KIDS' BEST INTEREST,

12:42.790 --> 12:47.193
THEN WHAT KIND OF COACH
DOES THAT MAKE ME?

12:48.530 --> 12:50.589
SHAWN: HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR DAMN MIND?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.762
COOP: MAN, TYRONE IS COMING
FOR US, SHAWN.

12:52.770 --> 12:54.363
HE SAID IT HISSELF.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.361
THIS IS A WAY OUT. THE LADY
SAID SHE COULD PROTECT US.

12:56.370 --> 12:58.259
SHAWN: I DON'T NEED
NO PROTECTION.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.601
COME ON, SHAWN.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.305
LOOK, THIS AIN'T JUST
ABOUT YOU, ALL RIGHT?

13:01.310 --> 13:02.630
GETTING A GUY LIKE
TYRONE OFF THE STREETS

13:02.640 --> 13:04.347
IS GONNA PROTECT
THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.579
I AIN'T NO SNITCH.
I GOT A CODE.

13:05.580 --> 13:06.877
WHAT GOOD IS THAT
GONNA DO FOR YOU?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.473
YOU SEEM TO FORGET
HOW THINGS WORK DOWN HERE

13:08.480 --> 13:10.642
NOW THAT YOU CASHED
YOUR GOLDEN TICKET, BEVERLY.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.311
RATTING ON YOUR OWN
WILL GET YOU LAID OUT.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.459
AND LIVING
THIS LIFE WON'T?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.781
YOU BEEN FRONTING LIKE I
HAD TALENT AND YOU DIDN'T

13:16.790 --> 13:18.224
SINCE WE WAS KIDS,

WITH GUYS LIKE TYRONE.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.121
CHOOSE SOMETHING
ELSE NOW, MAN.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.529
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

13:24.530 --> 13:26.362
I DON'T.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.589
BUT I CARE
ABOUT COOP.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.432
AND SHE THINKS YOU DESERVE
A CHANCE AT SOMETHING MORE,

13:30.440 --> 13:33.808
SO, YOU CAN TAKE
MY HELP OR NOT.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.505
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.087
I'll FIND MY OWN
WAY OUT.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.390
SPENCER: LOOK, YOU CAN'T
BEAT YOURSELF UP, ALL RIGHT?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.562
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
YOU TRIED.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.265
SHAWN MADE HIS
CHOICE. ALL RIGHT?

14:03.270 --> 14:04.499
HE MADE IT WHEN
WE WAS KIDS,

14:04.510 --> 14:07.309
AND HE MADE IT
AGAIN TODAY.

14:07.310 --> 14:08.471
LOOK, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU GIVEN ME

14:08.480 --> 14:10.107
THE BIG
TAMIA COOPER SPEECH

14:10.110 --> 14:11.646
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE
TO SAVE THE WORLD,

14:11.650 --> 14:13.914
HOW I GOTTA
SAVE MYSELF FIRST?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.979
YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME I
GOTTA TAKE MY SHOT, COOP,

14:15.980 --> 14:17.243

OF MYSELF.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.479
AND I WAS RIGHT.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.582
SO, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA REALIZE THAT

14:19.590 --> 14:21.786
YOU DESERVE
THAT CHANCE, TOO?

14:21.790 --> 14:23.656
YOU COULD BE SO MUCH
MORE THAN THIS, COOP.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.628
HOW IS IT
YOU CAN'T SEE THAT?

14:25.630 --> 14:27.029
I GUESS IT'S JUST
EASIER TO SEE IT

14:27.030 --> 14:28.429
IN OTHER PEOPLE.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.626
I SEE IT IN YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

14:32.430 --> 14:35.070
TIME TO START SEEING
IT IN YOURSELF NOW.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.878
HA!

14:43.280 --> 14:45.840
WOW. SO, YOUR DAD
WAS REALLY THAT MAD?

14:45.850 --> 14:47.113

14:47.120 --> 14:50.545

FOOTBALL VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY.

14:50.550 --> 14:53.019
YOU SAID HE PLAYED
IN THE NFL?

14:53.020 --> 14:55.079
YEAH, UNTIL HE
BLEW HIS KNEE OUT.

14:55.090 --> 14:57.058
NOW HE JUST TAKES HIS
ASPIRATIONS OUT ON HIS PLAYERS.

PROBLEM WITH YOU ATHLETES.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.629
I MEAN, MY BROTHER
DOES THE SAME THING.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.325
YOU PUT YOUR ALL
INTO SOME GAME,

15:03.330 --> 15:05.059
AND THEN FOR WHAT?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.334

SOME BUSTED KNEE?

DESTROYED, BUT, HEY,

30:42.470 --> 30:45.132
STEP BACK, I'M GOIN' IN...

30:45.140 --> 30:47.165

30:47.170 --> 30:49.036
REF. REF.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.371
BRING IT IN.
BRING IT IN.

30:50.380 --> 30:51.541
WHERE'S THE
FIELD GOAL UNIT?

30:51.550 --> 30:53.609
NO, 57 YARDS.
WE CAN'T MAKE THAT.

30:53.610 --> 30:57.114
HEY, YO, SPENCE. RIVER RUN.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.849

31:10.400 --> 31:12.892

31:14.500 --> 31:16.468
ANNOUNCER:

31:16.470 --> 31:19.064
8 SECONDS LEFT TO DETERMINE

NO TIME-OUTS REMAINING.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS PLAY.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.803
BAKER WITH THE SNAP,

31:25.810 --> 31:27.778
LATERALS THE BALL
TO SPENCER JAMES.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.550
IT'S A PASS TO JORDAN BAKER

32:08.420 --> 32:10.218
-YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR.
-THANKS, DAD.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.688
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

32:11.690 --> 32:12.680
-YES, SIR.

32:12.690 --> 32:13.885
- I LOVE YOU.
-I LOVE YOU.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.028
ALL RIGHT.

32:20.700 --> 32:25.536
MAN: DREAM UNTIL
IT COMES IN FOCUS

32:25.540 --> 32:28.999
JUST TILL YOU KNOW IT

32:29.010 --> 32:32.571
I COULD WIN IT ALL

32:32.580 --> 32:34.969
I COULD WIN IT ALL

32:36.850 --> 32:40.241
'CAUSE I WAS BORN
TO OVERCOME

32:40.250 --> 32:41.911
WIN IT ALL

32:41.920 --> 32:43.513
I BELIEVE

32:43.520 --> 32:45.022

32:50.500 --> 32:54.425

32:55.600 --> 32:57.694
ASHER: GOOD JOB. GOOD GAME.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.539
NICE CATCH.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.201
IF I DON'T WATCH OUT,
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MY SPOT

33:04.210 --> 33:05.974
IN THE PLAYOFFS.

33:05.980 --> 33:07.402
SEE YOU LATER.

33:09.150 --> 33:11.016
WHERE'D THAT TRICK
PLAY COME FROM?

33:12.220 --> 33:13.847
CRENSHAW'S PLAYBOOK.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.258
WE SHOULD ADD IT
TO OURS.

33:17.260 --> 33:18.489
GOOD IDEA, MAN.

33:18.490 --> 33:19.560
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO COME UP WITH

33:19.560 --> 33:21.289
A WHOLE NEW PLAYBOOK,

33:21.290 --> 33:23.930
SINCE SOMEONE GAVE
MALIBU OURS.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.898
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HAPPENED.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.097
COME ON, MAN.
IT WAS YOU.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.329
OK? I--I SAW
THE LOOK

33:31.340 --> 33:32.739
YOU THREW DELGADO, OK?

33:32.740 --> 33:36.529
HOW YOU TOLD ME THERE'S
NO WAY THAT WE COULD WIN?

33:36.540 --> 33:39.339
THEY READ EVERY SINGLE
MOVE WE MADE, MAN.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.117
WILL YOU JUST
LET ME EXPLAIN THIS?

33:46.220 --> 33:47.415
MY LIFE WAS
FALLING APART,

33:47.420 --> 33:48.558
AND IN A MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS--

33:48.560 --> 33:50.312
ANOTHER MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.628
H--HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GONNA USE

33:51.630 --> 33:54.088
THAT SORRY-ASS EXCUSE
TO COVER YOURSELF, HUH?

33:56.830 --> 33:59.800
AND YOUR SPOT
IN THE PLAYOFFS?

33:59.800 --> 34:01.325
IT'S GONE.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.061
AS SOON AS I TELL MY DAD WHAT
YOU DID, YOU'RE OFF THIS TEAM.

34:04.070 --> 34:06.505
YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

34:06.510 --> 34:09.969
OVER ONE GAME
THAT YOU JUST WON?

34:09.980 --> 34:11.869
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS JUST FOOTBALL, MAN.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.303
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO. NOT TO ME.

34:14.310 --> 34:17.109
AND IF YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
THERE ON THAT FIELD WITH US,

34:17.120 --> 34:18.985
YOU WOULD'VE
FELT THAT.

34:29.030 --> 34:31.192
HEY.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.929
UM, THE BAKERS
WERE JUST LEAVING,

34:32.929 --> 34:34.864
AND THEY LET ME IN.

34:34.870 --> 34:36.531
BUT IF--IF YOU WANT
TO BE ALONE, I CAN--

34:36.540 --> 34:38.463
NO, IT'S ALL GOOD.
COME IN.

34:42.139 --> 34:44.837
WHO WERE YOU
LISTENING TO?

34:44.840 --> 34:48.071
NOTHING. I, UH... I GOT TO
PUT THOSE ON SOMETIMES

34:48.080 --> 34:49.570
TO BLOCK OUT THE NOISE.

34:49.580 --> 34:52.550
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
I'M SO SORRY.

34:52.550 --> 34:55.257
WERE YOU CLOSE
WITH HIM?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.784
YEAH, WE USED TO BE.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.585
WE TOOK OUR OWN
PATHS, AND IT WAS

34:59.590 --> 35:01.558
A COMPLICATED
FRIENDSHIP.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.528
HE WAS TAKING STEPS
TO BETTER HIMSELF.

35:03.530 --> 35:04.656
YOU KNOW, HE HAD
A DAUGHTER.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.867
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THEY TOLD HER.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.591
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW YOU FIND OUT.

35:10.600 --> 35:15.106
IT'S ALL A...A BLUR
THAT DOESN'T SEEM REAL.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.399
I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW MY DAD TOLD ME

35:18.410 --> 35:20.879
ABOUT MY MOM.
I JUST REMEMBER...

35:22.520 --> 35:24.648
TIME STANDING STILL.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.116
KIND OF LIKE RIGHT NOW?

35:35.560 --> 35:41.067
MAN: I DIG MY TORCH
INTO THE EARTH

35:41.070 --> 35:46.008
THROUGH AND THROUGH,
I KNOW I LOVE HER

35:46.010 --> 35:48.604
BURNING WITH
THE DEVIL'S PASSION

35:48.610 --> 35:52.148
GOT US ACTING KIND OF CRAZY

35:54.880 --> 35:57.019
I KNOW THAT LOVE HURTS

35:57.020 --> 36:01.480
THEY SAY IT'S BETTER
TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST

36:01.490 --> 36:02.889
THAN NOT AT ALL

36:02.890 --> 36:05.587
I CAN'T LIVE WITH ALL THIS

36:05.590 --> 36:08.184
ANOTHER BROKEN HEART

36:22.510 --> 36:25.309
SO, THAT
JUST HAPPENED.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.574
-LOOK, LEILA--
-IT'S OK.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.419
WHAT'S OK?

36:30.420 --> 36:32.809
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT WAS.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.481
WHAT WAS IT?

36:36.490 --> 36:40.552
YOU BLOCKING OUT
THE NOISE.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.951
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT

36:43.960 --> 36:45.792
THESE PAST FEW HOURS,
AND I

36:45.800 --> 36:48.019
DON'T WANT THIS TO
AFFECT OUR FRIENDSHIP.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.532
I DO.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.962
SO, YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS?

36:50.970 --> 36:52.859
NO, I WANT TO BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

36:52.870 --> 36:55.407
-BUT YOU SAID--
-LOOK, I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

36:55.410 --> 36:57.071
ALL RIGHT?
THAT AIN'T HOW I FEEL.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.071
I DON'T WANT TO
KEEP PUSHING AWAY

36:59.080 --> 37:00.002
HOW I FEEL NO MORE.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.705
LIFE'S TOO SHORT
FOR THAT.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.514
IT'S UP TO YOU.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.284
YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS?

37:13.560 --> 37:15.153
NO.

37:17.630 --> 37:20.019
MAN: I'VE BEEN
WAITING WIDE AWAKE

37:20.030 --> 37:22.362
FOR THE WAVES
TO COME AND TAKE

37:22.370 --> 37:24.896
TAKE ME RIGHT TO YOU

37:27.770 --> 37:30.705
FEEL LIKE I'M
CIRCLIN' A DRAIN

37:30.710 --> 37:35.546
ALL I SEE IS THE REMAINS
OF AN UGLY TRUTH

37:35.550 --> 37:37.279
OF AN UGLY TRUTH

37:37.280 --> 37:39.715
ONE HUNDRED MODELS
I COULD FOLLOW

37:39.720 --> 37:41.882
ALL THE WAY TO HELL AND BACK

37:41.890 --> 37:43.984
BUT THEY CAN'T REPLACE YOU

37:43.990 --> 37:45.355
THEY CAN'T REPLACE YOU

37:45.360 --> 37:48.751
PATIENCE: HEY, I KNOW
IT'S HARD, BUT, UH...

37:48.760 --> 37:51.320
I'M JUST GLAD THAT YOU'RE
OUT OF ALL THIS NOW.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.894
MAN: WISH
THAT I COULD HAVE CONTROL

37:55.900 --> 37:59.268
EVERYBODY DIES ALONE...

37:59.270 --> 38:00.829
IT AIN'T OVER.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.979
MAN: SAY MY PRAYERS

38:02.980 --> 38:05.608
BUT I LOST FAITH
A LONG...

38:05.610 --> 38:07.044
TYRONE:
WE GOT YOU.

38:08.950 --> 38:12.716
MAN: DREAM NIGHTMARES,
I GUESS

38:12.720 --> 38:16.452
WE'RE GETTING
USED TO LOSING HOPE

38:16.460 --> 38:19.384
USED TO LOSING HOPE

38:19.390 --> 38:22.291
PROBABLY BEST YOU GO STAY
WITH YOUR MOTHER FOR A WHILE.

38:22.300 --> 38:26.828
NO USE YOU BEING HERE
IF YOU'RE OFF THE TEAM.

38:26.830 --> 38:29.037
YOU KNOW THAT
SHE DOESN'T WANT ME.

38:30.670 --> 38:32.729
THAT'S FOR YOU
TO FIGURE OUT.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.412
PRINCIPAL LANDON: COACH...

38:47.420 --> 38:50.082
LOCKER ROOM. NOW.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.197
BOY: WHAT'S UP, FELLAS?

39:02.200 --> 39:03.599
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:03.600 --> 39:05.762
ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.001
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.
FELLAS, I'M, UH,

39:12.010 --> 39:13.546
GONNA KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET.

39:13.550 --> 39:16.144
UH, APPARENTLY,
THE SPORTS COMMITTEE

39:16.150 --> 39:20.644
RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS TIP
THAT ONE OF OUR PLAYERS, UH,

39:20.650 --> 39:22.459
VIOLATED THE DRUG POLICY, SO,

39:22.460 --> 39:24.758
I'M AFRAID Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE
TO GET DRUG-TESTED TODAY.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.921
-COME ON.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.580
BILLY: T KNOW.
I KNOW IT'S A PAIN.

39:27.590 --> 39:30.093
I'M SURE Y'ALL DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.660
LET'S JUST LINE UP, GET THIS
THING OVER WITH, ALL RIGHT?

39:32.670 --> 39:34.490
COME ON. GO.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.389
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

39:39.770 --> 39:40.965
SO...

39:40.970 --> 39:43.302
WHAT HAPPENS IF A PLAYER
TESTS POSITIVE?

39:43.310 --> 39:47.178
OH, THEY GET SUSPENDED
FOR THE PLAYOFFS. YEAH.

39:47.180 --> 39:48.739
AHEM. DAD...

39:50.620 --> 39:52.440
I'M GONNA FAIL.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.342
HELL OF A PERFORMANCE
LAST NIGHT.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.511
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU?

40:28.520 --> 40:30.784
I USED TO COACH
WITH YOUR DAD.

40:30.790 --> 40:32.053
I EVEN RECOMMENDED
THAT HE TAKE OVER

40:32.060 --> 40:34.119
AT BEVERLY WHEN
I LEFT.

40:34.130 --> 40:35.894
THEY WERE HIGH
ON HIM.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.551
THEN BILLY BAKER
SWOOPED IN

40:38.560 --> 40:42.394
WITH HIS NFL RESUME,
AND SUDDENLY

40:42.400 --> 40:44.562
NOW THE JOB WASN'T
COREY'S ANYMORE.

40:44.570 --> 40:47.039
GAME'S OVER, COACH.
WE WON.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.599
ALL RIGHT? YOU CAN STOP
MESSING WITH MY HEAD.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.169
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

40:50.180 --> 40:52.740
I ALWAYS LIKED COREY.
I STILL DO.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.002
I MEAN, SURE,
HE LET HIS EMOTIONS

40:54.010 --> 40:55.409
GET IN THE WAY
OF THINGS SOMETIMES,

40:55.420 --> 40:56.945
BUT HE'S A GOOD MAN.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.647
YEAH. GOOD MAN WHO
ABANDONED HIS FAMILY.

40:59.650 --> 41:02.585
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.581
I JUST KNOW THAT...

41:04.590 --> 41:06.126
HE CARRIED
A PICTURE OF YOU

41:06.130 --> 41:07.985
AROUND IN HIS WALLET,

41:07.990 --> 41:10.220
BRAGGING ABOUT HIS SON.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.319
THE COREY I REMEMBER...

41:14.770 --> 41:17.068
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT A REASON.

41:17.070 --> 41:21.974
AND BILLY BAKER,
THAT MAN,

41:21.980 --> 41:24.779
HE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO GET WHAT HE WANTS.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.976
MAN: HEY. WE MAY
HAVE AN ISSUE HERE.

42:19.530 --> 42:20.998
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
