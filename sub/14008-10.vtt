00:02.558 --> 00:03.225
You need to see this arrest report.

00:03.226 --> 00:03.891
This arrest report.

00:03.892 --> 00:04.625
Who got busted?

00:04.626 --> 00:06.159
You know, I was just going
to give it to a friend.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.093
Going to give it to a friend.

00:07.094 --> 00:07.827
She's your sister.

00:07.828 --> 00:09.161
Mom, she committed a felony.

00:09.162 --> 00:11.028
Talk to someone. Make it go away.

00:11.029 --> 00:12.929
Don't get involved.
And I can't intervene.

00:13.197 --> 00:13.863
What is it?

00:13.864 --> 00:15.298
My sister. I need a favor.

00:15.299 --> 00:16.799
You're gonna keep
those checks coming.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.700
Why would I possibly do that, dad?

00:19.302 --> 00:21.202
Because I got a big mouth,
Mr. Winstone.

00:22.438 --> 00:23.571
What's that family going to do

00:23.572 --> 00:25.605
when they find out you've been
lying to them all these years?

00:26.907 --> 00:28.707
Patty Hewes contacted me.

00:28.708 --> 00:30.408
She wanted to know whether or
not I spent last Thanksgiving

00:30.409 --> 00:31.141
with my mom.

00:31.142 --> 00:33.009
Did you spend
Thanksgiving with her?

00:33.010 --> 00:34.910
My mom made me promise
to never talk about it.

00:34.911 --> 00:36.811
I still don't understand
about Thanksgiving.

00:36.945 --> 00:38.413
Why would that lead
you to the money?

00:38.414 --> 00:40.314
Well, we think we know where the
Tobins are hiding it: Antigua.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.815
And Thanksgiving was Louis
Tobin's last chance to

00:43.183 --> 00:44.650
move the money before he confessed.

00:44.651 --> 00:46.285
Patty knows the money's in Antigua.

00:46.286 --> 00:48.186
There's nothing to worry about,
as long as you

00:48.788 --> 00:50.288
don't get greedy and start

00:50.289 --> 00:51.189
spending the money anytime soon.

00:51.190 --> 00:52.556
I don't see how this could
have anything to do with

00:52.557 --> 00:53.290
the Tobins' money.

00:53.291 --> 00:55.292
Why is she lying to us?

01:26.779 --> 01:28.780
Patty?

01:47.460 --> 01:49.994
What's for dinner?

01:53.998 --> 01:55.898
How was school today, sweetheart?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.433
Fine.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.935
Did you pick those for me? Yeah.

02:02.369 --> 02:04.370
Oh. They're so beautiful.

02:05.905 --> 02:10.073
Let's put them in water.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.608
You must be so hungry
after all that playing.

02:15.411 --> 02:16.978
You wanna help me make dinner?

02:16.979 --> 02:18.879
Can I stir the sauce?

02:19.114 --> 02:21.014
Of course you can.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.620
Be careful now- it's a
big spoon and really hot.

02:30.787 --> 02:32.354
Go slow.

02:32.355 --> 02:33.622
Like this?

02:33.623 --> 02:35.623
Look at you.
You're such a big girl.

02:38.594 --> 02:40.593
Nice and easy. Good job.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.865
What's the matter,
Ellen? What's this?

02:51.635 --> 02:54.770
That's you, sweetheart.

03:00.897 --> 03:06.649
Transcrypt by www.Addic7ed.Com

03:42.922 --> 03:44.822
I just want to help.

03:45.757 --> 03:47.657
So, tell me exactly what
happened leading up to the

03:48.259 --> 03:49.425
arrest.

03:49.426 --> 03:51.326
I should have told you
the truth in the first

03:51.794 --> 03:53.361
place.

03:53.362 --> 03:55.262
I'm sorry.

03:55.864 --> 03:58.198
Uh, you remember my friend
Becky from-from High School?

04:00.100 --> 04:01.667
Yeah, I remember.

04:01.668 --> 04:03.568
Well, she's in a real
bad place, you know?

04:06.538 --> 04:09.172
Just... on some shit
and she wanted meth.

04:12.041 --> 04:13.941
So you gave her some?

04:14.643 --> 04:15.243
I have no money, Ellen.

04:15.244 --> 04:17.144
Ellen.

04:18.113 --> 04:20.213
I couldn't... give it to her,
so sold her a little.

04:21.982 --> 04:23.882
Have you ever sold before?

04:24.151 --> 04:26.051
God, no. Never.

04:27.786 --> 04:29.686
I was just trying to help a friend.

04:31.322 --> 04:33.222
- And she gave you up?
- Yeah.

04:36.358 --> 04:37.291
Show up, and they find more shit,
and I get arrested for

04:37.292 --> 04:40.394
intent to distribute.

04:45.030 --> 04:46.930
Is there anything
else I should know?

04:47.732 --> 04:49.732
No. Nothing.

04:54.936 --> 04:56.836
Well, I'll, um, I'll look at
the situation and see what

04:57.605 --> 04:59.005
I can do.

04:59.006 --> 05:00.072
I thought you said you
couldn't have anything to

05:00.073 --> 05:01.973
you couldn't have anything
to do with this case.

05:03.109 --> 05:05.076
I can't. But I've
found someone who can

05:10.816 --> 05:12.716
I think I may know why
Tessa marchetti lied to us

05:13.451 --> 05:14.250
about Thanksgiving.

05:14.251 --> 05:16.151
You got her employment
records from the airline?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.921
Take a look at her
November flight plan.

05:20.156 --> 05:22.056
On Thanksgiving night,
Tessa flew to Antigua.

05:22.526 --> 05:25.161
That was her first trip down.

05:26.362 --> 05:28.262
And she's flown there
every week since.

05:28.764 --> 05:30.664
How do you make sense of that?

05:31.099 --> 05:32.132
Louis Tobin had to start moving

05:32.133 --> 05:34.033
the money down there
before he confessed.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.203
But Tessa didn't start making
those flights until after.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.272
Maybe the money was
already down there.

05:43.107 --> 05:46.642
And on Thanksgiving night,
Tessa started moving it out.

05:50.312 --> 05:51.646
Come in.

05:51.647 --> 05:53.547
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm afraid

05:53.615 --> 05:54.715
it's urgent.

05:54.716 --> 05:55.515
- Yes?
- The Tobin

05:55.516 --> 05:56.683
the Tobin plaintiffs have demanded

05:56.684 --> 05:58.685
plaintiffs have demanded a meeting.

06:01.554 --> 06:04.422
Patty Hewes approached
Tessa marchetti.

06:06.424 --> 06:07.357
How do you know that?

06:07.358 --> 06:09.258
Tessa told your mother.

06:09.259 --> 06:11.260
They've become friendly.

06:12.628 --> 06:17.664
Been having lunch together.

06:18.799 --> 06:20.699
What did Tessa tell Patty Hewes?

06:20.734 --> 06:22.634
Apparently, she kept
her mouth shut and

06:22.935 --> 06:24.835
protected the family.

06:25.337 --> 06:27.237
I'll talk to my mother.
I don't want her having any

06:28.905 --> 06:30.805
more contact with Tessa.

06:31.707 --> 06:33.707
- I agree.
- The girl lied for us.

06:36.677 --> 06:39.511
I should thank her.

06:40.813 --> 06:42.713
Look, Ms. Hewes, this isn't
personal, but you people

06:44.516 --> 06:46.350
are not getting the job done.

06:46.351 --> 06:48.251
I'm aware of the hardships
each of you is facing

06:49.087 --> 06:51.155
every day.
And I sympathize with the

06:51.890 --> 06:53.757
fact that...

06:53.758 --> 06:55.993
We don't need your sympathy.
We need money.

06:57.061 --> 06:58.961
You've already sold the
Tobins' assets and holdings.

06:59.864 --> 07:01.764
Why don't you just give us
what you were able to recover?

07:02.466 --> 07:04.366
Our goal is to make you
financially whole again.

07:05.170 --> 07:06.803
If we stop pursuing the
Tobins now, we won't be

07:06.804 --> 07:08.704
able to do that.

07:08.773 --> 07:09.740
Ms. Benjamin.

07:09.741 --> 07:11.641
If the money were to be
distributed today, each

07:12.611 --> 07:13.945
of the thousands of victims

07:13.946 --> 07:15.846
would receive less than three
percent of your individual

07:17.616 --> 07:18.950
losses.

07:18.951 --> 07:20.918
As I've said from the start,
we believe there is

07:22.754 --> 07:24.588
more money out there.

07:24.589 --> 07:26.489
A lot more.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.690
Well, maybe another attorney
would have better luck

07:29.291 --> 07:30.491
finding it.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.492
We have asked the
court to replace you.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.862
Th-that's a mistake.

07:37.497 --> 07:39.531
We want a new lawyer taking over.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.867
I'm sorry.

07:42.868 --> 07:44.868
I wish it didn't
have to be like this.

07:52.641 --> 07:54.808
This woman was totally hammered,
so she orders piÃ±a

07:55.910 --> 07:57.810
coladas for everyone on the plane.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.778
Everybody loves a party.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.679
Yeah, but we don't
even have piÃ±a coladas.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.615
So then she starts freaking
out and yelling at everyone...

08:05.152 --> 08:07.953
Tessa? Uh, I don't
mean to interrupt.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.222
I'm Joe.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.123
You're Louis Tobin's son.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.092
I don't mean to bother you.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.427
I was hoping we could talk.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.397
Hey, um, I'm going to
meet you inside, okay?

08:19.799 --> 08:21.699
Yeah, sure. You okay?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.942
I thought I wasn't
supposed to talk to you.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.445
I know. But things
are different now.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.446
But things are different now.
I wanted us to meet.

08:37.982 --> 08:39.883
Your father was always
wonderful to me and my

08:40.452 --> 08:41.753
mom.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.654
None of that's going to change.

08:46.091 --> 08:47.526
My family's still here for you.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.427
Okay. Thank you.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.763
I know you've been
seeing my mother.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.367
She told me Patty Hewes asked
you about Thanksgiving night.

08:59.137 --> 09:01.805
I appreciated you...
Not talking to her about it.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.009
- Sure.
- Was that your boyfriend?

09:08.412 --> 09:10.312
Yeah.

09:10.648 --> 09:12.650
You guys go and have
dinner somewhere special.

09:17.622 --> 09:19.522
Enjoy yourself. Thanks.

09:20.958 --> 09:22.959
And if you need anything else,
just let me know.

09:23.027 --> 09:26.029
My number's in there.

09:30.401 --> 09:32.402
So I guess this makes
you my half-brother.

09:33.904 --> 09:35.905
I guess so.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.010
Take care of yourself, Tessa.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.616
You think Tessa
marchetti's been moving

09:48.318 --> 09:50.218
money out of Antigua? Yeah.

09:50.754 --> 09:52.654
So what are we going to do next?

09:54.525 --> 09:57.393
- We pursue Tessa.
- Nothing.

09:59.062 --> 10:00.663
Why?

10:00.664 --> 10:02.564
Tobin's victims have filed
a petition to remove me

10:03.034 --> 10:03.800
from the case.

10:03.801 --> 10:05.701
Yeah, all the more reason
to keep going, to put

10:07.005 --> 10:08.071
pressure on Tessa, find out why

10:08.072 --> 10:09.506
she lied to us about Thanksgiving.

10:09.507 --> 10:10.840
It's not the right time.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.642
What are you talking about?

10:12.643 --> 10:13.576
We've got no leverage.

10:13.577 --> 10:15.477
So, what, we're going to
sit around and-and wait for

10:16.180 --> 10:18.080
them to kick us off the case?

10:18.416 --> 10:19.382
This could be our last chance.

10:19.383 --> 10:20.217
It's my decision.

10:20.218 --> 10:22.019
But it's the wrong decision!

10:22.020 --> 10:22.820
Calm down, Tom.

10:22.821 --> 10:24.655
Don't tell me to calm down.

10:24.656 --> 10:26.556
We are not going to approach
Tessa marchetti now.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.194
The victims have filed a petition.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.095
We need to write a brief
to defend ourselves.

10:31.664 --> 10:32.630
That's our priority.

10:32.631 --> 10:34.632
Paperwork is not
going to solve this.

10:45.809 --> 10:47.644
Did you get in touch with Malcolm?

10:47.645 --> 10:49.545
I did. I set up a meeting.

10:49.613 --> 10:51.513
He should be able to help
you with your sister.

10:53.818 --> 10:55.819
Thank you. I'll see you, Patty.

11:02.471 --> 11:04.371
They sent it back, Lenny.

11:04.607 --> 11:06.308
The charity actually
sent it back to me.

11:06.309 --> 11:08.143
What is that, sweetheart?

11:08.144 --> 11:10.212
My check to the fund
for Africa's future.

11:12.181 --> 11:14.081
Read it.

11:14.517 --> 11:16.218
They won't let me go to Tanzania.

11:16.219 --> 11:18.086
I've been going on that
annual trip for over a decade.

11:18.087 --> 11:19.821
I know how much this
foundation means to you.

11:19.822 --> 11:20.989
I'm sorry.

11:20.990 --> 11:22.890
Yes, look at this. Kamil...

11:24.193 --> 11:26.093
And ajabu... and imara.

11:27.530 --> 11:29.297
I want to see my children, Lenny.

11:29.298 --> 11:30.766
I understand, but if the
board doesn't want you

11:30.767 --> 11:31.834
to go...

11:31.835 --> 11:33.735
Oh, screw the goddamn board.

11:34.304 --> 11:36.204
I've been sponsoring these
kids their whole lives.

11:38.575 --> 11:39.942
They're my only purpose now.

11:39.943 --> 11:41.843
All right, I'll see what I can do.

11:42.645 --> 11:44.545
There's someone on the
board I think will be

11:44.814 --> 11:46.714
sympathetic. Who's that?

11:47.684 --> 11:49.584
Stuart zedeck.
He's an old friend of Louis'.

11:49.820 --> 11:51.720
I don't know if
you've ever met him.

11:52.656 --> 11:54.556
I haven't. But I'll track him down.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.025
After all I've done
for that charity.

11:59.596 --> 12:01.496
They cannot do this to me.
We'll Sue them.

12:02.031 --> 12:03.832
Well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, Marilyn.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.733
I'm sure there's
something I can do.

12:06.903 --> 12:08.803
The victims from the Tobin
fraud want to remove Patty

12:09.272 --> 12:11.172
from the case. Why?

12:11.841 --> 12:13.741
Because we're not
making enough progress.

12:14.478 --> 12:16.378
I thought you found
that account in Antigua.

12:16.847 --> 12:18.747
We did, but we can't touch it.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.986
If we're removed from this case,
we'll never recover the money.

12:24.255 --> 12:25.388
So what are you saying?

12:25.389 --> 12:28.558
I'm saying that we have to sell.

12:30.528 --> 12:32.029
Sell what?

12:32.030 --> 12:34.465
Everything, anything that
we don't absolutely need.

12:41.239 --> 12:43.139
I took a... an offer
on the Lake house.

12:44.442 --> 12:46.342
Did you want to ask me first?

12:47.645 --> 12:48.746
Jesus...

12:48.747 --> 12:50.647
We're taking care of your
parents' mortgage, my

12:51.249 --> 12:52.950
parents' mortgage, your mother's

12:52.951 --> 12:54.618
chemotherapy.

12:54.619 --> 12:56.519
We may be supporting our
families for years until they

12:57.222 --> 12:59.890
can get out from under this,
and it's all my fault.

13:00.925 --> 13:02.092
I understand.

13:02.093 --> 13:04.795
I just think we need to make
these decisions together.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.597
There's nothing you
and Patty can do?

13:07.633 --> 13:09.533
There's one possible witness,
but Patty doesn't think

13:09.835 --> 13:11.735
we have enough leverage to

13:11.937 --> 13:13.939
approach her. What do you think?

13:18.911 --> 13:20.811
You guys go right in.
Why don't you get to work?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.980
Maybe you'll accomplish
something today.

13:24.416 --> 13:27.619
Can I get you guys some coffee?

13:28.821 --> 13:30.455
What was that about?

13:30.456 --> 13:32.356
He's pissed because I haven't
been able to link the

13:32.425 --> 13:34.325
Tobins to Danielle
marcetti's death.

13:34.828 --> 13:36.662
Those guys looked like detectives.

13:36.663 --> 13:38.497
Gates is reinterviewing them.

13:38.498 --> 13:40.398
He thinks I must have missed
something the first time around.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.434
For your sake, I hope he's wrong.

13:47.907 --> 13:49.807
The case stalled out.
We have no leads.

13:50.944 --> 13:52.844
This is Leonard Winstone.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.280
I need to talk to
you about Marilyn.

13:55.615 --> 13:57.515
How's the girl holding up?

13:57.617 --> 13:59.517
She's fine.
But she's upset about the

14:00.386 --> 14:02.286
charitable foundation.
What happened?

14:03.122 --> 14:05.022
Marilyn wrote a check
and it was sent back.

14:05.391 --> 14:07.291
So what does she want?

14:07.627 --> 14:09.527
She's passionate about
this charity, Mr. zedeck.

14:09.996 --> 14:11.896
She's desperate to go on this
trip to Tanzania, and she wants

14:12.999 --> 14:14.800
to approach the board herself.
I told her I'd handle it.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.669
I told her I'd handle it.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.570
I see.

14:20.007 --> 14:21.907
I need your help.

14:21.975 --> 14:25.277
Let me see what I could do.

14:31.051 --> 14:32.951
How old is your sister?

14:33.854 --> 14:35.754
- 34.
- Any priors?

14:36.257 --> 14:38.625
No. Her husband
just left her with a

14:40.161 --> 14:42.061
newborn. So she's
desperate and broke,

14:42.997 --> 14:45.264
but she's never done
anything like this before.

14:45.332 --> 14:48.034
This is her arrest report.

14:54.141 --> 14:56.041
She sold narcotics to a friend?

14:56.143 --> 14:58.043
Carrie's friend got busted,
then she copped a plea

15:01.249 --> 15:02.382
and gave up Carrie.

15:02.383 --> 15:04.283
If this woman testifies
in court to save her

15:04.952 --> 15:06.852
own ass, your sister could
be looking at jail time.

15:07.588 --> 15:08.688
Yeah, I know.

15:08.689 --> 15:10.589
Patty said I should do
everything possible to make

15:11.292 --> 15:13.193
sure that doesn't happen.
You understand what that means?

15:15.463 --> 15:17.363
Yes, but I don't want you
doing anything without

15:18.466 --> 15:20.667
talking to me first. Understood.

15:22.903 --> 15:24.803
Let me do some legwork,
see what I can find on the friend.

15:26.006 --> 15:27.906
Hopefully, she won't
hold up as a witness.

15:28.476 --> 15:29.409
Thank you.

15:29.410 --> 15:31.310
I'm sorry for your sister.

15:32.579 --> 15:34.479
And for you.

15:35.783 --> 15:36.949
I'll be in touch.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.850
At the australian open
over the weekend, the

15:39.553 --> 15:41.287
championship matches were played

15:41.288 --> 15:43.188
in temperatures well
over 100 degrees.

15:44.258 --> 15:46.158
As Craig lamolt reports from
member station wshu, there was a

15:47.561 --> 15:49.461
different kind of tennis
championship heading into this

15:50.998 --> 15:53.099
weekend. A very different...

15:53.100 --> 15:55.000
A very different...

16:11.018 --> 16:13.420
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

16:14.688 --> 16:16.322
I'm really not sure what you want.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.223
I already told you
everything that I know.

16:18.759 --> 16:19.859
No, you lied to us.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.294
We know you spent
Thanksgiving with your mother.

16:23.296 --> 16:24.329
Sit down.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.230
If you want to arrest me,
you can go ahead.

16:37.110 --> 16:39.010
Listen, I'm not interested
in having you arrested.

16:40.079 --> 16:41.979
I want you to know the truth
about the Tobin family.

16:43.549 --> 16:45.116
Yeah, what's that?

16:45.117 --> 16:47.118
They had your mother killed.

16:48.387 --> 16:50.255
My mother was in a car accident.

16:50.256 --> 16:52.023
When she was released from
the hospital, the doctors

16:52.024 --> 16:53.924
said she would make
a full recovery.

16:54.126 --> 16:56.026
She had brain surgery.
There were complications.

16:56.662 --> 16:57.796
She died of heart failure.

16:57.797 --> 16:59.697
That's not why she died.

16:59.865 --> 17:01.765
It was only made to look that way.

17:01.934 --> 17:03.834
The Tobins murdered her
to protect their money.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.204
You don't know those people.

17:07.204 --> 17:09.105
You don't understand who
you're dealing with.

17:09.507 --> 17:11.406
My mother died because
the doctors screwed up.

17:11.675 --> 17:13.542
It had nothing to
do with the Tobins.

17:13.544 --> 17:15.546
Just tell me the truth
about Thanksgiving.

17:22.387 --> 17:24.387
I don't need you
or your protection.

17:41.739 --> 17:45.041
How many rocks? Neat.

17:46.143 --> 17:48.043
You are so goddamn beautiful.

17:48.779 --> 17:51.180
Look at you.

18:03.926 --> 18:04.960
Yes.

18:04.961 --> 18:07.229
Tell me I'm not rascist.

18:08.231 --> 18:10.131
I told you never to phone here.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.900
I said, tell me I'm not a rascist.

18:13.436 --> 18:15.336
Just give me a second,
will you, sweetheart?

18:15.338 --> 18:17.339
Thanks. Sure.

18:20.276 --> 18:22.176
What are you talking about?

18:22.846 --> 18:24.746
I got a mailman name of chung.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.750
Now either I'm a racist,
or he's been stealing those checks

18:30.954 --> 18:32.688
you've been sending me.

18:32.689 --> 18:34.589
You have been sending me checks,
haven't you?

18:35.358 --> 18:36.358
No.

18:36.359 --> 18:38.259
I thought I made myself clear.

18:39.195 --> 18:40.896
I got a big mouth.

18:40.897 --> 18:42.797
I'd hate to accidentally
open it to the Tobins.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.133
Don't threaten me.

18:45.134 --> 18:46.835
You're not getting shit.

18:46.836 --> 18:48.736
I honestly thought you
were smarter than that.

18:49.106 --> 18:51.006
Listen to me, I do not know
what the hell you think

18:51.008 --> 18:51.908
you're doing.

18:51.909 --> 18:53.776
I'm disappointed in you.

18:53.777 --> 18:55.845
Dad... dad!

19:02.185 --> 19:05.220
Thank you, Johnny.

19:06.489 --> 19:07.089
You want to get lunch?

19:07.090 --> 19:08.290
Lunch?

19:08.291 --> 19:09.991
Uh, no, I can't I'm too busy.

19:09.992 --> 19:11.760
Sorry. Next time.

19:11.761 --> 19:13.661
That's what you said the last time.

19:13.696 --> 19:15.596
Did I?

19:15.931 --> 19:19.034
You run a pretty good racket,
but I think I'm on to you.

19:24.574 --> 19:26.474
- Excuse me, sir.
- Can I help you?

19:26.576 --> 19:28.476
I'd like to speak to someone
about an investigation

19:28.712 --> 19:30.112
you're conducting.

19:30.113 --> 19:32.114
- Okay, and you are?
- Tessa marchetti.

19:37.019 --> 19:38.919
Was my mother's death a homicide?

19:39.822 --> 19:41.722
The medical examiner's results were

19:42.158 --> 19:43.192
inconclusive.

19:43.193 --> 19:45.260
Are the Tobins being
investigated for her death?

19:46.962 --> 19:48.862
The investigation is ongoing,
Ms. marchetti.

19:49.598 --> 19:51.498
I'm sorry, we're not at liberty
to discuss the details.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.000
Because I was approached
by an attorney who

19:54.937 --> 19:56.370
said the Tobins killed her.

19:56.371 --> 19:58.272
An attorney? Did you get a name?

19:59.575 --> 20:01.475
His name is Tom shayes.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.447
He works with Patty Hewes.

20:05.448 --> 20:07.348
I'm very sorry he approached you,
Ms. marchetti,

20:08.651 --> 20:10.551
but those allegations
are entirely unfounded.

20:11.721 --> 20:13.621
I promise you.

20:15.091 --> 20:16.991
Why don't we get your
contact information and

20:17.527 --> 20:19.427
we'll be in touch if there's
any new developments.

20:23.499 --> 20:25.399
Here.

20:25.768 --> 20:27.668
Thank you for coming in.

20:27.837 --> 20:29.737
I'm sorry you had to
go through all of this.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.280
Tom shayes? Is that the
guy you had me do a

20:40.183 --> 20:41.150
favor for a while back?

20:41.151 --> 20:42.952
- Nick...
- Don't answer that.

20:42.953 --> 20:44.853
Actually, I have a better question.

20:44.854 --> 20:46.754
Why is Patty Hewes tampering
with our investigation?

20:48.091 --> 20:49.258
I've no idea. I...

20:49.259 --> 20:51.260
Is Patty Hewes the
reason we've stalled out?

20:56.399 --> 20:58.466
No, it's because of Patty
that I'm making progress.

21:00.002 --> 21:01.902
I told gates to follow her lead.
He wouldn't listen to me.

21:03.672 --> 21:04.772
What are you doing?

21:04.773 --> 21:06.541
Please don't go to
gates about this.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.442
Well, you're not leaving
me much of a choice.

21:09.478 --> 21:11.378
You're working with Patty
Hewes behind our backs.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.048
I'm not working with her-
I'm using her.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.219
She's better than gates.

21:19.387 --> 21:21.287
Patty will find what she needs
to bring down the Tobins, trust

21:22.057 --> 21:23.957
me. And when she does, I will have

21:24.926 --> 21:26.193
access to it.

21:26.194 --> 21:28.195
And we will have enough
to make an arrest.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.367
If you don't go to gates with this,
I can share the

21:37.706 --> 21:39.274
credit with you.

21:39.275 --> 21:41.309
We both know a bust like
this can make a career.

21:48.585 --> 21:50.585
Do what you have to.

21:53.556 --> 21:56.491
I'm in.

21:56.492 --> 21:57.759
I'm in. I can't believe we're even

21:57.760 --> 21:59.660
I can't believe we're even
considering letting Marilyn

22:00.497 --> 22:01.897
Tobin go on the trip.

22:01.898 --> 22:03.999
There's no evidence that Mrs.
Tobin knew about the fraud.

22:05.101 --> 22:07.001
And Mrs. Tobin was always
a dedicated member of

22:07.537 --> 22:09.104
this foundation.

22:09.105 --> 22:10.739
Oh, come on.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.640
Our public relations
would be a disaster.

22:13.676 --> 22:15.576
Let's put it to a vote, okay?

22:17.414 --> 22:19.014
I'm fine with that.

22:19.015 --> 22:21.016
Who doesn't want Marilyn
Tobin to go to Africa?

22:24.954 --> 22:26.854
That's five against. Okay.

22:28.191 --> 22:31.626
And who thinks she
should be allowed to go?

22:34.163 --> 22:36.063
And five in favor.

22:36.966 --> 22:41.069
Stu, you can't abstain.
You're the deciding vote.

22:42.639 --> 22:45.607
I'm sorry to say it, but...

22:48.711 --> 22:50.179
I think she should stay home.

22:50.180 --> 22:52.181
I don't want her anywhere
near this charity.

22:53.349 --> 22:54.883
If I hadn't been there,
Tessa would have talked

22:54.884 --> 22:56.084
to gates!

22:56.085 --> 22:57.152
I took a risk.

22:57.153 --> 22:59.053
Patty was very clear...

22:59.189 --> 23:01.089
Look, Patty has not
lost her life savings.

23:01.958 --> 23:03.960
Her family's not falling apart
because of these assholes.

23:06.029 --> 23:08.031
I'm sorry, Tom.

23:13.204 --> 23:15.104
Shayes no, I'm-I'm sorry.

23:17.876 --> 23:19.776
I shouldn't have pushed Tessa.
It backfired, and I-I screwed

23:21.212 --> 23:23.112
up.

23:23.648 --> 23:25.449
I'll, uh, I'll... I'll tell Patty.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.350
No. Don't.

23:27.719 --> 23:29.619
And if she finds out,
blame it on me.

23:30.121 --> 23:31.755
I'm not gonna do that.

23:31.756 --> 23:33.656
What is she gonna do, fire me?

23:35.860 --> 23:37.760
Thank you.

23:38.028 --> 23:39.928
And don't worry about Tessa.

23:42.866 --> 23:44.866
I'll take care of her.
I got to get back to work.

23:55.011 --> 23:56.911
So you think the Tobins
are using this Tessa

23:57.680 --> 23:59.580
marchetti to move their
money out of Antigua.

24:00.115 --> 24:03.151
Yes. And we're working on
securing her cooperation.

24:04.153 --> 24:06.654
I'm sorry, this doesn't cut it.

24:08.424 --> 24:10.324
I already warned you once,
and you haven't made any more

24:10.659 --> 24:12.394
progress.

24:12.395 --> 24:14.295
Your job is to recoup the
money and distribute it.

24:14.697 --> 24:16.597
That's just not happening.
And I'm sorry to say, the

24:17.533 --> 24:19.433
plaintiff's arguments to
replace you is damn persuasive.

24:20.470 --> 24:22.838
I can't distribute the money
fairly until I know how

24:23.773 --> 24:24.907
much is there.

24:24.908 --> 24:27.443
What if you're wrong
about this Tobin account?

24:28.845 --> 24:30.745
Many of these victims are
in dire financial straits.

24:32.047 --> 24:33.947
They need whatever they can get,
and they need it now.

24:34.884 --> 24:36.784
I could always use my own
resources to go after the

24:37.553 --> 24:39.120
Tobins.

24:39.121 --> 24:41.956
Operate outside the bounds
of my courtroom, Patty...

24:43.292 --> 24:44.792
I'll have you disbarred.

24:44.793 --> 24:46.693
Your honor, when I find
the Tobins' money, nobody

24:48.497 --> 24:51.699
is gonna care about how I did it.

24:53.468 --> 24:55.368
Consider yourself warned.

24:56.171 --> 24:58.071
You have one week.

24:58.107 --> 25:00.108
Tessa marchetti doesn't pan out,
you're off the case.

25:14.123 --> 25:15.324
Did you pick those for me?

25:15.325 --> 25:17.325
Did you pick those for me?
For me? For me?

26:14.116 --> 26:17.151
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
You can't go to Tanzania.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.421
I don't understand.
Did you talk to Mr. zedeck?

26:22.557 --> 26:24.457
Yes. He said he did everything
he could to convince

26:24.593 --> 26:26.627
the board, but he couldn't
change their minds.

26:42.244 --> 26:44.144
There's an Albert
wiggins here to see you.

26:45.847 --> 26:47.281
Says he's an old friend.

26:47.282 --> 26:49.182
Tell him I'm with a client.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.988
I'll have to get back to him.
Who was that?

26:56.391 --> 26:57.625
No one important.

26:57.626 --> 26:59.526
Mr. wiggins, I said
you can't go in there.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.263
I'm sorry, Lenny.
I know I'm being rude, but...

27:04.299 --> 27:07.301
I just got into town
and I had to say hello.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.904
This is not a good time.

27:11.773 --> 27:13.741
You must be Marilyn Tobin.

27:16.278 --> 27:18.178
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you in person.

27:19.781 --> 27:21.681
Your lawyer has told me such
lovely things about you over the

27:22.350 --> 27:23.817
years.

27:23.818 --> 27:26.720
I'm sorry, I don't recall
Lenny mentioning you.

27:27.955 --> 27:30.057
Leonard was my student
at law school.

27:31.927 --> 27:33.827
The finest brain I ever
had the pleasure to teach.

27:34.529 --> 27:35.830
Really?

27:35.831 --> 27:37.731
And are you just in town visiting?

27:38.066 --> 27:39.966
The truth of the matter is,
my lovely wife passed

27:43.472 --> 27:45.073
away recently, so...

27:45.074 --> 27:46.974
I'm thinking of
retiring to the city.

27:47.377 --> 27:49.277
I'm sorry to hear about your wife,
but Mrs. Tobin

27:50.213 --> 27:52.113
and I are in the middle
of something here.

27:52.248 --> 27:54.148
Of course, of course.

27:54.617 --> 27:57.252
Um, I'll... get out of your hair.

27:58.821 --> 28:00.721
I just wanted you to
know I'll be around.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.993
I'm looking forward
to a chat sometime.

28:08.531 --> 28:10.699
Soon.

28:11.734 --> 28:13.634
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

28:13.670 --> 28:14.670
Where's dad?

28:14.671 --> 28:16.571
He's downstairs double-parked.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.840
I'm just gonna grab my coat.

28:19.209 --> 28:20.276
How you doing?

28:20.277 --> 28:22.177
I can't lie,
we're both worried sick.

28:22.678 --> 28:24.578
We have so many questions for you.

28:24.714 --> 28:26.614
Your father went online to find
out about drug charges and court

28:26.616 --> 28:28.183
out about drug charges and court
proceedings and everything, but

28:28.184 --> 28:30.084
proceedings and everything,
but it's just so confusing.

28:31.154 --> 28:33.054
Please be patient with us.
Of course, mom.

28:36.793 --> 28:38.127
Hey, do you know who that is?

28:38.128 --> 28:40.028
Oh, my goodness,
where did you find this?

28:40.897 --> 28:42.797
In some old stuff. Who is she?

28:44.034 --> 28:46.202
Oh, she babysat for you
and Carrie years ago.

28:47.704 --> 28:49.604
You were very young.
Let's go, your father's waiting.

28:51.475 --> 28:53.009
- What was her name?
- Uh, I don't know.

28:53.010 --> 28:55.378
Uh, I don't know. Um... Anne...

28:56.413 --> 28:58.313
Something. I don't remember.

28:59.483 --> 29:00.816
It was so long ago, sweetheart.

29:00.817 --> 29:02.451
I've been having dreams about her.

29:02.452 --> 29:03.886
Oh, really?

29:03.887 --> 29:05.787
Did I ever sleep at her house?

29:06.190 --> 29:08.491
What? No, of course not.

29:09.627 --> 29:11.527
Because I think I
remember sleeping there.

29:12.964 --> 29:14.864
Well... I don't remember.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.235
Now, come on, before
your father gets angry.

29:27.577 --> 29:29.177
Could I talk to you for a second?

29:29.178 --> 29:31.513
Yeah, about what?

29:37.922 --> 29:40.356
Ellen Parsons. Go on.

29:41.592 --> 29:43.593
She's been talking to Patty Hewes.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.761
So, what did you find out?

29:59.730 --> 30:01.630
Your sister's lying to you.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.434
She's knee-deep in this shit.

30:04.435 --> 30:05.468
How so?

30:05.469 --> 30:06.402
This isn't a onetime thing.

30:06.403 --> 30:09.406
Onetime thing. She's
been selling for a while.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.844
So this witness is
telling the truth?

30:15.279 --> 30:17.179
Well, she's no saint,
either, but it looks like

30:19.284 --> 30:21.452
she's on the level. Unbelievable.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.354
There are still things
you can do to apply

30:25.857 --> 30:28.859
pressure, make this witness
think twice about testifying.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.000
Unless... you've had
a change of heart.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.936
You know what,
I think I'll just handle it

30:40.405 --> 30:42.305
myself.

30:44.109 --> 30:45.309
And that other thing?

30:45.310 --> 30:47.845
Her name's Anne Connel.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.648
What were you able to find?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.684
Not much. All I could
get was an address.

30:53.886 --> 30:56.554
It's about a hundred
miles out of the city.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.623
Out of the city. Thank you.

31:05.597 --> 31:08.366
Thank you for handling
Marilyn's situation.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.635
How'd she take it?

31:11.771 --> 31:13.471
Not well.

31:13.472 --> 31:17.241
I feel bad about it, but,
uh, it's for her own good.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.211
We got to keep her
away from the charity.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.516
The less scrutiny, the better.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.884
Understood.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.785
I always liked her.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.687
She means well. But...

31:34.058 --> 31:35.958
She talks too much.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.160
- You got my lunch?
- Egg salad on rye.

31:39.096 --> 31:40.996
They were all out of pumpernickel.

31:41.765 --> 31:43.665
You hungry?
You want half a sandwich?

31:43.901 --> 31:45.568
No, no, no, thank you.

31:45.569 --> 31:47.570
Here you go, Mr. Winstone.

31:52.109 --> 31:54.009
For now, we're going to
have to keep doing this a

31:55.113 --> 31:56.480
little at a time.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.483
Of course. The Tobins
will be grateful.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.625
So, Malcolm came through for me.

32:12.229 --> 32:13.330
And?

32:13.331 --> 32:16.266
My sister was lying
about everything.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.436
I'm sorry.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.337
Maybe she deserves to go to jail.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.641
I don't know,
help straighten her out.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.283
She has a baby, and...
My parents would be devastated.

32:37.388 --> 32:40.890
What would you do?

32:43.394 --> 32:46.496
Ellen, my husband is gone,
and my unemployed teenage

32:49.600 --> 32:50.900
son is about to be a father.

32:50.901 --> 32:52.801
I think you might want to ask
someone else for family advice.

32:55.639 --> 32:57.539
At least corey stuck by you.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.683
How do you think Tom is doing?

33:14.659 --> 33:17.961
Do you speak to him much? No,
not really.

33:21.266 --> 33:23.166
He's been so tense lately.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.143
Have a hole over there.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.044
So are you going ahead
with the renovation?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.917
Oh, yeah. I haven't
made a decision yet.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.193
I wanted to ask you something.

33:53.697 --> 33:57.699
Do you know who this woman is?

33:58.601 --> 34:00.101
Where did you find that?

34:00.102 --> 34:02.002
That's what mom wanted to know.

34:02.071 --> 34:03.971
You showed this to mom?

34:04.841 --> 34:06.741
Shouldn't have done that.

34:08.243 --> 34:10.143
Why? Do you know who she is?

34:10.913 --> 34:12.813
What did mom tell you about her?

34:13.882 --> 34:16.184
She said that she used
to babysit for me.

34:18.821 --> 34:20.721
Then I guess she did.
I only remember seeing her once

34:21.657 --> 34:23.658
or twice, and mom never
liked talking about her.

34:29.264 --> 34:31.165
You know, when we were kids,
you used to tell me I

34:33.069 --> 34:34.969
was adopted. I was just screwing

34:37.639 --> 34:38.773
with you.

34:38.774 --> 34:40.308
Jesus, Ellen, you weren't adopted.

34:40.309 --> 34:41.176
You have the same stupid
parents I do, okay?

34:41.177 --> 34:43.077
Parents I do,
okay? You're a Parsons.

34:43.478 --> 34:45.378
Forget about that woman
and deal with it.

34:46.313 --> 34:48.315
Now, can you help me
with my case or not?

34:54.322 --> 34:56.723
Yes, I can. But I'm not going to.

35:00.229 --> 35:01.963
Why not?

35:01.964 --> 35:03.864
You did this to yourself.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.900
So don't blame me.
Or mom or dad or anyone else,

35:08.738 --> 35:10.638
for that matter.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.275
You put yourself in here.
Deal with the consequences.

35:23.952 --> 35:25.852
This city's a shithole.

35:26.655 --> 35:28.555
What do you care? You're leaving.

35:29.992 --> 35:31.892
Finish your drink, then I'm
putting you on a bus back home.

35:33.963 --> 35:36.697
Thanks. But I ain't leaving, kid.

35:41.070 --> 35:43.872
Listen to me. I have connections.

35:45.709 --> 35:47.609
I know people who can hurt you.

35:48.378 --> 35:51.112
Yeah. I just have
to pick up a phone.

35:52.414 --> 35:53.148
Another round?

35:53.149 --> 35:55.149
Just keep them coming.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.390
When you left, I thought
you were getting out of the

36:04.993 --> 36:06.893
business.

36:07.762 --> 36:09.662
Just turning your back
on your dear ol' dad.

36:12.701 --> 36:14.601
But, hell, you're pulling
the biggest con of all.

36:15.204 --> 36:17.104
No, this is my job, dad.

36:19.374 --> 36:20.974
I'm an attorney.

36:20.975 --> 36:22.875
And the Tobins aren't marks,
they're clients.

36:24.112 --> 36:25.078
Right.

36:25.079 --> 36:28.382
They're more than clients,
they're...

36:28.449 --> 36:30.451
Clients, they're... what, family?

36:39.661 --> 36:41.663
My son's buying.
He's a big shot lawyer.

36:46.501 --> 36:49.470
Long or short, a con's a con.

36:52.774 --> 36:55.442
This may come as a surprise,
but I didn't come here to spoil

36:56.377 --> 36:58.178
your game.

36:58.179 --> 37:00.079
There is no game.

37:00.481 --> 37:02.381
Shit.

37:02.683 --> 37:04.751
Louis Tobin- what he got away with.

37:06.086 --> 37:07.986
The guy's better than both of us.

37:08.288 --> 37:10.156
There's no way he wasn't gonna
stash away something before he

37:10.157 --> 37:10.991
kicked.

37:10.992 --> 37:13.460
- He didn't.
- Horseshit!

37:16.764 --> 37:18.766
There's money. And I want in.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.670
- Ms. Parsons.
- Tessa.

37:25.139 --> 37:27.039
Why are we not meeting
in your office?

37:28.776 --> 37:29.976
I could lose my job.

37:29.977 --> 37:32.379
So this meeting never
took place, okay?

37:36.217 --> 37:38.117
I understand.

37:38.319 --> 37:40.219
The truth is, we do
believe the Tobins were

37:42.323 --> 37:43.957
involved in your mother's death.

37:43.958 --> 37:44.858
Why do you think that?

37:44.859 --> 37:47.695
I can't give you specifics, but...

37:50.466 --> 37:52.533
I'm concerned for your safety.
What should I do?

38:00.376 --> 38:02.377
Thank you, Ms. Parsons.

38:05.281 --> 38:07.181
So we have one week,
then the judge is just gonna

38:07.283 --> 38:08.249
dump us?

38:08.250 --> 38:10.251
Yes, it seems that judge
Reilly and the victims

38:11.053 --> 38:11.652
have lost their confidence in us.

38:11.653 --> 38:13.220
Us.

38:13.221 --> 38:16.691
That-that-that is bullshit.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.460
Hello.

38:19.461 --> 38:20.128
This is Tessa marchetti.

38:20.129 --> 38:22.130
I want to talk to you again.

38:28.237 --> 38:30.137
Okay, Tessa.
I'd be happy to see you.

38:30.974 --> 38:32.874
I'm just a couple blocks
away from your office.

38:33.242 --> 38:35.142
Why don't you come on over.

38:36.512 --> 38:37.312
I'll be waiting.

38:37.313 --> 38:39.213
- All right.
- Tessa.

38:41.417 --> 38:43.418
Everything's going to be fine.
I'm on my way.

38:49.392 --> 38:51.927
I wonder why she decided to talk.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.996
I have no idea.

38:58.434 --> 39:01.502
Call office.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.470
District attorney.

39:04.106 --> 39:05.840
Hi, it's Ellen Parsons.

39:05.841 --> 39:07.741
Could you tell Curtis gates I
won't be coming in tomorrow?

39:08.276 --> 39:11.279
Sure, miss Parsons.
Can I tell him why?

39:12.581 --> 39:14.481
Tell him I'm out of town
on an investigation.

39:14.883 --> 39:16.783
Certainly. Thank you.

39:36.471 --> 39:38.371
Tessa marchetti? Yes.

39:39.106 --> 39:41.006
Come with us, please.

39:42.109 --> 39:44.110
- Where is she?
- Call her.

39:48.382 --> 39:55.455
You're under arrest.

39:55.523 --> 39:58.258
Don't answer that.
