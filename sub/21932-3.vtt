00:46.212 --> 00:48.180
(Mr. Fellows): I'm saying

00:48.182 --> 00:50.082
it's a bad idea.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.084
The banquet, or the fact
that it's being held

00:52.086 --> 00:54.553
in complete darkness?
Well, obviously I'm not

00:54.555 --> 00:56.455
against banquets.
I do work in a hotel.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.260
This dinner is in honour
of a very special guest

01:01.262 --> 01:03.262
who is both blind and deaf.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.564
Which is why we've invited
blind and deaf guests

01:05.566 --> 01:07.399
as well as charitable donors.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.903
Exactly! Mixing the rich with
the poor? With the lights out?

01:10.905 --> 01:12.838
And a constituency

01:12.840 --> 01:15.240
specially skilled
for such circumstance?

01:15.242 --> 01:18.343
The opportunity for theft
is obvious.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.213
As a fellow detective,

01:21.215 --> 01:23.615
you must appreciate my position.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.019
I believe I'm more concerned
with the potential for mishap

01:27.021 --> 01:28.887
than avarice, Mr. Fellows.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.889
But I'm not unconcerned.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.724
(sighing)

01:32.726 --> 01:34.526
Why does our hotel
need a detective?

01:34.528 --> 01:37.463
I believe you and I living
here may have had something

01:37.465 --> 01:40.666
to do with that.
Still. One detective per hotel

01:40.668 --> 01:43.936
should be sufficient.
Doctor, Detective.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.071
Wonderful to see you again.
Mr. Bell. It is

01:46.073 --> 01:48.740
indeed a pleasure.
Mr. Bell.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.742
Allow me to introduce
my wife, Mabel.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.578
Hello.
How do you do?

01:52.580 --> 01:55.948

of honour this evening,

Miss Helen Keller

02:01.021 --> 02:03.856
Mrs. Anne Sullivan Macy.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.858
Doctor Julia Ogden
and Detective William Murdoch.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.860
I'm so happy
to finally meet you.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.862
I feel I know you already

02:09.864 --> 02:11.864
from our letters.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.866
This... is...

02:13.868 --> 02:17.102
Doctor... Ogden...

02:17.104 --> 02:20.239
and William... Murdoch.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.841
How wonderful to meet you.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.377
And thank you

02:25.379 --> 02:27.379
for helping organize this dinner.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.481
Where everyone will be
as blind as I am.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.617
May I see you?

02:31.619 --> 02:33.785
She wants to touch your face.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.355
Oh. Of course.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.827
You're smiling.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.098
I understand
you can read lips?

02:46.100 --> 02:49.935
I can. But I make mistakes.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.939
Meet my husband.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.180
And you are very handsome.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.382
(soft chuckling)

03:03.384 --> 03:05.984
Fascinating. Her fingers can

03:05.986 --> 03:08.187
see as well as hear.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.255
Quite accurately I might add.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.960
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.229
if you would please

03:17.231 --> 03:19.298

if you were

03:32.213 --> 03:33.845
to take your leave, sir.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.681
I beg your pardon?
To find you here

03:35.683 --> 03:37.583
in present company is an insult.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.785
At least I've paid to be here.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.321
You either leave or I'll
be forced to do something

03:42.323 --> 03:44.189
I might regret.
Take your seat.

03:44.191 --> 03:47.059
What's the matter?

03:47.061 --> 03:49.361
I'm missing my steak knife.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.263
And my napkin.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.165
Well, you could
just borrow mine.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.602
Don't be tedious.
Goodness.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.971
I'm missing my napkin too.
However will I

03:58.973 --> 04:02.608
dab my mouth?
Excuse me. Hello? Waiter.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.576
We're missing a knife
and two napkins.

you should all have your meals
in front of you by now.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.236
Please take a moment
to acquaint yourself

04:31.238 --> 04:32.504
with everything
you will be needing.

04:36.509 --> 04:40.312
Please remember this is
an experiment in experience.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.781
And whilst it's
always preferable

04:42.783 --> 04:45.017
for the sightless to have sight,

04:45.019 --> 04:48.320
sometimes it helps

04:48.322 --> 04:50.756

William, are you still there?
No. I seem to have

05:05.873 --> 05:08.507
completely disappeared.
This darkness is

05:08.509 --> 05:12.144
quite extraordinary.
I so rarely experience this.

Well, as you know, I've
been committed to hybrid teas

05:15.115 --> 05:17.115

to become a rosarian.

for what I'm going to call

05:26.160 --> 05:28.093
Crimson Sunrise because
there's just a hint of red.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.729
Sunrises are yellow.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.665
Sunsets are red.

SIR!

06:06.967 --> 06:09.801
This gentleman is deaf.
Allow me.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.874
The killer likely covered
his mouth with this napkin,

06:15.876 --> 06:18.610
and then used the countervailing
force to push in the knife.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.713
Any idea of the force
that would have been required?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.949
Well, woman could have done it
if that's what you're asking.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.118
Didn't I tell you something
like this would happen?

06:26.120 --> 06:29.087
I don't recall you mentioning
anything about murder.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.890
A crime of opportunity was
what I predicted.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.661
Detective, if I may be
of any assistance...

06:36.663 --> 06:38.663
Yes. I would be grateful
if you could

06:38.665 --> 06:41.233
aid in the questioning of
the deaf guests. The constables

06:41.235 --> 06:44.136
will be arriving--
Why are you wasting time with the deaf?

06:44.138 --> 06:47.172
The blind is who you should
focus on. Who else could

06:47.174 --> 06:50.275
find someone in the pitch dark,
let alone kill them?

06:50.277 --> 06:53.078
We have guests
that are both blind and deaf.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.614
Yes, Helen Keller.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.517
She has the skills,
no doubt about it. But...

06:58.519 --> 07:01.086
the killer instinct?
Mr. Fellows,

07:01.088 --> 07:03.021
if you don't mind,

07:03.023 --> 07:04.589
I have an investigation...

07:04.591 --> 07:06.591
Of course.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.861
I'm just the hotel detective, after all.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.664
Is there anything you'll be
requiring of us, Detective?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.866
I'd like to take Helen
back to her room.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.835
Very well. But stay there.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.904
I will need to interview
both of you.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.509
I do have some information
you may find pertinent.

07:24.511 --> 07:27.479
What would that be?
I overheard some guests

07:27.481 --> 07:29.881
complaining about
a missing knife...

07:29.883 --> 07:33.118
and two napkins, if I recall.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.621
It's probably nothing.
Sorry to waste your time.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.657
(sighing)

07:38.659 --> 07:41.293
George, Henry,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.295
please interview
all of the guests.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.031
And get a copy
of the seating chart, please.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.433
Sir. I take it dinner
did not go as planned?

07:50.336 --> 07:52.571
No, it did not.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.507
Oh, and please find out which
guests were missing a knife

07:55.509 --> 07:57.809
and two napkins.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.911
Sir.
Sir.

07:59.913 --> 08:03.014
The killer inserted the knife
into the narrow gap

08:03.016 --> 08:04.850
between the spine and the skull.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.986
He or she knew to slide
the weapon in sideways.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.021
Detective Murdoch,

08:10.023 --> 08:11.923
it may interest you to know

08:11.925 --> 08:15.193
that I made an audio recording
of the dinner.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.196
Two, in fact.
Oh?

08:18.198 --> 08:21.199
I was hoping to learn whether
the lack of visual reference

08:21.201 --> 08:23.034
would affect the way we speak.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.505
I gather you'd like a listen.
Yes, I would.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.373
So, was this your right
shoulder or your left?

08:28.375 --> 08:30.208
George. I found out

08:30.210 --> 08:32.277
who reported the knife
and napkins missing.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.546
Ruth Newsome?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.448
And the man she's with.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.851
Right. Do you want me
to interview them? I know
she's a bit spoony over you.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.886
It's OK. I can manage it.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.922
Miss Newsome.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.091
Constable Higgins!

08:48.027 --> 08:49.995
Oh, isn't it dreadful?
Have you determined who did it?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.997
Not yet, I'm afraid.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.599
This is my fiancé,

08:54.601 --> 08:58.203
Herbert Wilson.
Your fiancé?

09:01.073 --> 09:02.774
Congratulations.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.343
Yes. We're overjoyed.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.780
So... so... overjoyed.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.284
I understand you were
missing your knife?

09:12.286 --> 09:15.487
And our napkins.
And when did you
notice them missing?

09:15.489 --> 09:17.389
As I sat down.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.457
I had the matter
rectified immediately.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.394
That kind of sloppiness
is an embarrassment.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.829
(Ruth): Herbie is one
of the organizers.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.798
Yes. I believe in returning
to those in need a small portion

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
of my good fortune.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.937
A simple credo,
but one to which I am committed.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.139
(chuckling)

09:34.141 --> 09:36.374
<i>Well as you know I've been</i>
<i>committed to hybrid teas</i>

09:36.376 --> 09:38.910

<i>rosarian. And I've been working</i>

09:38.912 --> 09:41.379

<i>in Canada. I have</i>
<i>particularly high hopes...</i>

09:46.219 --> 09:48.219
Bloody hell!
She can prattle on.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.555
(audio recording stopped)
I heard footsteps.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.557
Yes.
Could it be the waiter?

09:52.559 --> 09:54.759
No. All of the waiters
were out of the room

09:54.761 --> 09:57.696
at the time the lights
went out. Could you

09:57.698 --> 09:59.898
play it back again?

10:04.370 --> 10:07.305
<i>Why don't you tell me</i>
<i>about your latest rose?</i>

10:07.307 --> 10:09.641
<i>Well, as you know, I've been</i>
<i>committed to hybrid teas</i>

10:09.643 --> 10:12.544
<i>since I decided to become...</i>
<i>There it is. I heard it.</i>

10:12.546 --> 10:15.580
Let it continue.
<i>Why don't you tell me</i>

10:15.582 --> 10:17.749
<i>about your latest rose?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Well, as you know, I've been</i>

10:17.751 --> 10:20.385
committed to hybrid teas since
I decided to become a rosarian.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.754
And I've been working
on developing a cross between

10:22.756 --> 10:25.523
<i>Persiana, which is Persian</i>
<i>in origin, and some of the more</i>

10:25.525 --> 10:28.460
<i>robust varieties found here</i>

10:28.462 --> 10:30.762
<i>high hopes for one that I'm</i>
<i>going to call Crimson Sunrise</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:32.998
<i>because there's</i>
<i>just a hint of red.</i>

10:33.000 --> 10:35.500
<i>Sunrises are yellow,</i>

10:35.502 --> 10:38.236
sunsets are red.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.373
Four steps, a pause,

10:41.375 --> 10:43.842
and then four more steps.
As if the killer took

10:43.844 --> 10:47.012
four steps to reach the victim
and then four more

10:47.014 --> 10:49.748
to return to his seat.
And the distance would depend

10:49.750 --> 10:52.450
on stride length,
which is variable.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.285
Between two and three feet.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.122
Roughly the distance
between one diner and the next.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.960
Our victim, David Thornton,
was seated at the middle

11:01.962 --> 11:04.562
of the table.
And four steps brings us

11:04.564 --> 11:06.464
to... either end.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.169
So the killer was on
the right side of the table.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.838
We know that Anne Sullivan
Macy was at that end.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.675
And... Helen was to her left

11:16.677 --> 11:19.110
at the head.
Who was at the other end?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.279
George and Henry will
have that information.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.014
What have you, gentlemen?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.116
Sir. A couple
of points of interest.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.019
A blind man by the name
of William Dawes was seen

11:28.021 --> 11:31.623
getting into a verbal spat
with the victim just before
the lights were turned out.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.525
A blind man would be more
capable than most.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.760
And three people report
being touched lightly

11:35.762 --> 11:38.596
on the right shoulder
while the lights were out.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.699
Where were they sitting?

11:40.701 --> 11:43.835
Seats R5 through R7.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.743
It's how the killer found his victim.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.245
<i>Well, as you know,</i>
<i>I have been committed</i>

11:54.247 --> 11:57.115
<i>to hybrid teas since I decided</i>
<i>to become a rosarian</i> .

11:57.117 --> 11:59.417
<i>And I've been working on</i>
<i>developing this cross between</i>

11:59.419 --> 12:02.220
<i>Persiana, which is Persianin origin,</i>

12:02.222 --> 12:04.756
<i>and some of the more robust</i>
<i>varieties found here</i>

12:04.758 --> 12:06.758
<i>in Canada. And I have</i>
<i>particularly high hopes</i>

12:06.760 --> 12:10.662
<i>for one that I'm going to call</i>
<i>Crimson Sunrise because</i>
<i>there is just this...</i>

12:12.598 --> 12:14.966
George, who was sat here?

12:14.968 --> 12:17.102
R8.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.937
That would be...

12:18.939 --> 12:20.939
William Dawes.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.842
The blind man.
Bring him in.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.817
Threaten him?
When did I threaten him?

12:32.819 --> 12:36.588
Witnesses reported an incident
shortly before supper began.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.157
I didn't mean kill him.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.693
What did you mean?

12:41.695 --> 12:43.661
Give him good rap on the skull.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.297
And I wouldn't
have regretted it.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.400
I was only saying that
to be civil.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.770
What exactly did
Mr. Thornton do to you?

12:51.772 --> 12:54.506
To me, nothing.
It was Miss Keller he insulted.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.308
How so?
She has surmounted

12:57.310 --> 12:59.944
the greatest obstacles
a person can face

12:59.946 --> 13:02.614
and this... moral wastrel

13:02.616 --> 13:05.450
has the temerity
to call her a fraud.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.285
Why is he marrying her?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.254
Why is who marrying whom?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.189
Herbert Wilson
and Ruth Newsome.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.558
What do you care?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.760
It just seems an odd pairing.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.396
She's rich. He's rich.
Exactly. What's in it for him?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.765
Well? Is the blind man our killer?

13:20.767 --> 13:23.034
Motive seems a bit thin.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.271
Also, the victim
wrote a weekly column entitled

13:26.273 --> 13:28.273
"The Inquiring Skeptic".

13:28.275 --> 13:31.442
I read that. He exposed
shams and whatnot.
Though even I thought

13:31.444 --> 13:35.079
the piece he wrote on Helen
Keller was a bit much.
What did he write about her?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.582
He criticized her for writing
about things she couldn't

13:37.584 --> 13:40.218
possibly know about. Like
clouds. Which I think is unfair.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.788
I've never seen God but I know
what he looks like.
Really?

13:43.790 --> 13:47.592
Of course. Big white beard.
Heavy eyebrows. Never smiles.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.594
Bald?
Bald?

13:49.596 --> 13:52.397
Well, I wouldn't think so.
If you were

13:52.399 --> 13:54.399
the supreme being of the
universe, would you choose to

13:54.401 --> 13:56.601
walk around with a naked pate?
Crabtree, enough!

13:56.603 --> 14:00.505
A man who wrote a crusading
column exposing cheaters
may have angered

14:00.507 --> 14:02.473
more than admirers
of Helen Keller.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.343
Right. I'll look into it.

Please, come in. Sit down.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.639
Mabel is an excellent
lip reader

15:41.641 --> 15:44.008
but you'll have
to face her squarely.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.545
You were seated
next to the victim,

15:47.547 --> 15:49.847
were you not?
That is correct.

15:49.849 --> 15:53.518
What information do you have
for me, Mrs. Bell?

15:53.520 --> 15:57.422
I believe I may have
overheard a message.
A message?

15:57.424 --> 15:59.691
In Morse code.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.896
How do you mean
you overheard it?

16:04.898 --> 16:07.332
She heard it
with her fingertips.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.200
Like this...

16:12.638 --> 16:14.639
Do you feel that?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.775
Barely.
It's very slight

16:17.777 --> 16:19.777
but a deaf person
would notice it.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.146
It's how I get
my dear Mabel's attention.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.218
When was this message sent?

16:27.220 --> 16:30.321
Just before the murder.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.290
And what was the message?

16:32.292 --> 16:35.293
I don't know Morse code well enough to say.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.741
You're right.

16:49.743 --> 16:52.410
But he seemed genuinely curious
about the roses.

If you're so put out by it,
Higgins, I don't know

16:55.415 --> 16:57.415
why you don't
ask her to marry you?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.584
Don't be ridiculous.
Well, I'm serious.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.754
She would take you any day
over Mr. Money Bags.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.589
George, she's bonkers.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.825
And, if you haven't noticed,
a little dim?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.962
You're no Newton
yourself, Higgins.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.865
Apple fell on his head.

Now, the lowest frequency

24:41.781 --> 24:44.648
to accept that fact,
the better off she will be.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.384
Did you know

24:47.386 --> 24:49.386
she and Mr. Thornton
intended to elope?

24:49.388 --> 24:51.722
I didn't know
it had gotten that far.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.924
I knew she was in love with him.

24:53.926 --> 24:57.795
I know they met in New Orleans.
Did you know he was going
to be at the banquet?

24:57.797 --> 25:00.164
No. That was a surprise.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.366
What did you intend to do?

25:02.368 --> 25:04.335
I don't know.
As it turned out,

25:04.337 --> 25:06.170
fate intervened.
Did it?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.405
Or did you kill him?

25:08.407 --> 25:10.741
Don't be absurd.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.244
You thought David Thornton
represented a threat:

25:13.246 --> 25:16.380
danger, heartbreak,
possibly worse.

25:16.382 --> 25:19.016
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect her?

25:19.018 --> 25:21.218
Not that.
Convince me.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.988
I was in my seat
the entire time.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.190
Can anyone vouch for that?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.559
Helen.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.863
Someone is here.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.299
(knocking)
Come in.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.108
I've come to take Helen
back to her room.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.943
Get out!
Oh, dear.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.178
I was afraid this would happen.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.248
How could you not tell me?

25:53.184 --> 25:55.486
How can I explain
if you won't listen?

25:57.289 --> 25:59.189
I'll see Helen
back to her room.

25:59.191 --> 26:02.259
Give her anger time.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.529
She still needs you.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.701
I'm sorry.
Just go!

26:15.507 --> 26:18.876
It's all right.
She's gone now.

26:18.878 --> 26:22.146
(door closing)

26:22.148 --> 26:24.748
Get your papers!

26:24.750 --> 26:28.085
(Murdoch): <i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your time, gentlemen.</i>

26:28.087 --> 26:30.387
If you could take the seats here
at the end of the table.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.290
All right.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.092
What's going on here?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.927
This is part

26:36.929 --> 26:38.996
of our ongoing investigation,
Mr. Fellows.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.465
And it's your duty to inform
me of any police business

26:41.467 --> 26:43.500
pertaining to this hotel.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.637
You don't have to
respect me, Detective,

26:46.639 --> 26:48.639
but I insist

26:48.641 --> 26:50.574
that you respect
the office I represent.

26:50.576 --> 26:54.845
Actually, Detective, I could
use your assistance
at this moment.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.815
Assistance?
We need somebody

26:57.817 --> 27:00.417
to play the role of the victim.
Are you being funny?

27:02.821 --> 27:04.955
No. Please, have a seat.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.858
All right.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.230
Oh! Re-enacting the crime, are we?

27:13.232 --> 27:15.099
That never hurts.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.102
I've done it myself on occasion.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.604
(Murdoch): Mr. Bell,
if you'd be so kind.

27:23.541 --> 27:26.677
<i>Well, as you know</i>....
Oh, I see.

27:26.679 --> 27:30.347
You're thinking
it's Anne Sullivan Macy.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.516
I considered her.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.518
<i>...a cross between Persiana,</i>

27:34.520 --> 27:36.553
<i>which is Persian in origin,</i>

27:36.555 --> 27:39.356
<i>and some of the more robust</i>
<i>Canadian varieties here.</i>

27:39.358 --> 27:42.326
And I'm especially excited about

27:42.328 --> 27:44.962
<i>one that I think</i>
<i>I'll call Crimson Sunrise</i>

27:44.964 --> 27:47.131
<i>because there's just a...</i>
<i>a hint of red.</i>

27:47.133 --> 27:49.133
That's eight steps.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.035
(audio recording stopped)
How did she get

27:51.037 --> 27:52.870
all the way back
without us hearing?

27:52.872 --> 27:54.972
Could she have
walked on the carpet?

27:54.974 --> 27:57.074
Not enough room.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.342
What if she took off her shoes?

27:58.344 --> 28:00.377
Would she think to do so?

28:00.379 --> 28:03.814
Did she know the banquet
was being recorded?
I never told anyone.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.550
(sighing)
Detective!

28:06.552 --> 28:08.652
What have you, George?
I've been reading through

28:08.654 --> 28:10.821
some of Mr. Thornton's articles.
I found one

28:10.823 --> 28:12.823
of particular interest.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.192
Apparently,
a well-respected professor

28:15.194 --> 28:17.928
believed that one of his
students stumbled upon a means

28:17.930 --> 28:19.930
of communicating with the dead.

28:19.932 --> 28:23.200
Now, they had demonstrations
and people came from all over

28:23.202 --> 28:25.002
and they would ask questions
into this device

28:25.004 --> 28:26.837
and the dead would respond.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.607
It was a great sensation and
they were even awarded a patent.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.843
I remember reading about this.
That's right.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.878
But then, Mr. Thornton here

28:34.880 --> 28:37.181
discovers that the device
is nothing more than version

28:37.183 --> 28:39.717
of Fessenden's wireless
voice transmitter.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.186
The student, of course,
was a confidence trickster

28:42.188 --> 28:44.288
and he'd conned everybody,
including the professor.

28:44.290 --> 28:47.424
He was just using his reputation
to sell the patent.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.127
George, what does this
have to do with our case?

28:50.129 --> 28:52.796
Sir. The professor
was Horace Carmondy.

28:58.870 --> 29:02.139
And he was seated here,
next to William Dawes.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.942
(indistinct speaking)

29:04.944 --> 29:06.910
Mr. Bell,

29:06.912 --> 29:09.747
if you could replay
the recording.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.749
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>I've become committed</i>

29:11.751 --> 29:14.251
<i>to hybrid teas ever since</i>
<i>I decided to become</i>

29:14.253 --> 29:17.121
<i>a rosarian. And I've actually</i>
<i>been working on a cross</i>

29:17.123 --> 29:19.323
<i>between Persiana,</i>
<i>which is Persian</i>

29:19.325 --> 29:22.926
<i>in origin, and some</i>
<i>of the more robust</i>

29:22.928 --> 29:25.162
<i>Canadian varieties found here.</i>

29:25.164 --> 29:27.164
<i>And I'm especially excited</i>

29:27.166 --> 29:29.066
<i>about one that I think</i>
<i>I'll call Crimson Sunrise</i>

29:29.068 --> 29:31.335
<i>because it has</i>
<i>just a... a hint of red.</i>

29:31.337 --> 29:33.570
George, bring in
Horace Carmondy.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.639
Sir.

29:40.578 --> 29:42.813
You think I killed him?
Are you forgetting?

29:42.815 --> 29:44.715
The killer touched me
on the shoulder.

29:44.717 --> 29:47.351
Of course you'd say that.
If you weren't touched

29:47.353 --> 29:49.353
that would mean
you were the killer.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.488
Did you know
who David Thornton was?

29:51.490 --> 29:54.792
Yes I knew who he was.
Of course you did.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.294
It was his column that exposed
your device as a fraud.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.897
I know what you're thinking.
But the truth is I've never

29:59.899 --> 30:02.166
blamed Mr. Thornton
for what happened.

30:02.168 --> 30:05.469
But he ruined your reputation.
Of course he didn't.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.138
A student who...

30:08.140 --> 30:11.141
preyed on my naivety
destroyed my reputation.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.243
Mr. Thornton was simply

30:13.245 --> 30:15.245
reporting the facts.

30:15.247 --> 30:18.048
It's got to be him.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.884
I agree he is
a strong suspect.

30:20.886 --> 30:23.153
But I'm troubled
by the very evidence

30:23.155 --> 30:25.155
that we're relying on.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.057
Why's that?
Well sir,

30:27.059 --> 30:28.926
if it was Mr. Carmondy,

30:28.928 --> 30:30.828
why touch a series of people
on the shoulder

30:30.830 --> 30:32.663
knowing that it would lead
to him being a suspect?

30:32.665 --> 30:34.998
So you think that someone else

30:35.000 --> 30:37.701
killed Thornton and then set it
up to look like it was Carmondy?

30:37.703 --> 30:41.038
Possibly. Mr. Bell, you made

30:41.040 --> 30:43.207
separate recordings from either
end of the table, correct?

30:43.209 --> 30:45.676
Yes.
What if we were

30:45.678 --> 30:48.912
to synchronize those and
play them back simultaneously,

30:48.914 --> 30:51.448
one in each ear?
Like a stereoscope.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.585
Only with sound!

30:54.587 --> 30:57.554
We might be able to determine
which direction

30:57.556 --> 31:00.090
the footsteps came from.
Yes, by Jove!

31:04.229 --> 31:07.064
Sir, I've got a theory.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.733
All right, Henry.
Let's have it.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.236
As you know, sir, Ruth Newsome
is engaged to Herbert Wilson.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.539
It's clearly a mismatch, sir,
so I did some investigating

31:15.541 --> 31:18.408
and it appears that he has
recently suffered a reversal

31:18.410 --> 31:20.477
of fortune, sir.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.413
And?
Well sir, it suggests

31:23.415 --> 31:25.983
that he is only marrying her
because he wants her money.

31:25.985 --> 31:29.253
Henry, what does this
have to do with the murder?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.788
Well, I don't know, sir,

31:31.790 --> 31:33.857
but it certainly
seems suspicious.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.729
Henry, Ruth Newsome
and Herbert Wilson

31:38.731 --> 31:41.098
were seated on the left side of the table

31:41.100 --> 31:42.933
and we know from the number of footsteps

31:42.935 --> 31:44.902
the killer was seated on the right.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.072
If you say so, sir.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.976
Henry, is it possible

31:52.978 --> 31:55.045
your interest in this  is personal?

31:57.081 --> 31:59.182
I just think
he's up to no good.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.353
All right,

32:03.355 --> 32:06.256
I seem to have synchronized
the sound recordings.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.126
So... now we should  be able to tell

32:09.128 --> 32:11.295
from which direction

32:11.297 --> 32:13.196
the sounds are coming.

32:13.198 --> 32:15.098
<i>Well, as you know, I've been</i>
<i>committed to hybrid teas</i>

32:15.100 --> 32:17.567
<i>since I decided to become</i>
<i>a rosarian. And I've been</i>

32:17.569 --> 32:19.569
<i>working on developing</i>
<i>a cross between Persiana,</i>

32:19.571 --> 32:22.072
<i>which is Persian in origin,</i>
<i>and some of the more robust</i>

32:22.074 --> 32:24.141
varieties found here in Canada.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.076
<i>I have particularly high hopes</i>
<i>for what I'm going to call</i>

32:26.078 --> 32:28.011
<i>Crimson Sunrise because</i>
<i>there's just a hint of red.</i>

32:28.013 --> 32:31.014
How strange.

32:31.016 --> 32:33.684
(Murdoch): The footsteps seem
to begin in the middle.

32:33.686 --> 32:36.520
And then go to one side

32:36.522 --> 32:38.789
and then double back
to the other side.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.891
Before returning
to the middle again.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.360
So the killer was sitting in
the middle, next to the victim?

32:43.362 --> 32:45.996
That's where my wife
was sitting.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.832
Oh. So who's the lady

32:48.834 --> 32:50.701
on the other side?
Ernestine Wallace.

32:50.703 --> 32:53.704
But I believe she was engaged in
a conversation with her husband

32:53.706 --> 32:55.772
at the time of the murder.
So nobody could have

32:55.774 --> 32:58.375
done it then. Well, good!
That'll save us a bit of work.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.844
Shall we have another listen?

33:00.846 --> 33:03.280
No.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.582
We're not listening anymore.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.852
I want everyone
back in the banquet room.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.887
May I have your attention?

33:10.889 --> 33:13.056
Thank you for all coming.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.259
I realize this may
seem unusual.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.261
Detective, what are we doing here?

33:18.263 --> 33:20.764
Oh! Are you going
to reveal the murderer?

33:20.766 --> 33:23.834
It's such a thrill to see
a real detective at work.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.436
Henry, could you please take

33:26.438 --> 33:28.338
Mr. Thornton's position?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.707
Oh, a re-enactment
of the events.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.843
How exciting!

33:32.845 --> 33:35.846
But something is missing.
Oh, yes. Your wife.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.349
My wife may be many things,
but I can say with assurance

33:39.351 --> 33:41.518
that she is not a killer.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.387
Unlike the rest of us, of course.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.622
Worthy of your suspicion.

33:48.359 --> 33:52.129
I'm going to play you
a recording of last
night's dinner.

33:52.131 --> 33:55.198
And as you listen, I would ask
that you close your eyes,

33:55.200 --> 33:58.769
and do exactly
what you were doing last night.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.438
Mr. Bell.

34:06.911 --> 34:08.911
<i>Why don't you tell me</i>

34:08.914 --> 34:10.914
<i>about your latest rose?</i>

34:10.916 --> 34:12.815
<i>Well, as you know,</i>
<i>I have been committed</i>

34:12.818 --> 34:15.351
<i>to hybrid teas since I decided</i>
<i>to become a rosarian...</i>

34:17.889 --> 34:21.291
(indistinct overlapping
conversations)

34:29.734 --> 34:32.803
<i>What was that?</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>I don't know.</i>

34:35.473 --> 34:38.074
Well, I must say

34:38.077 --> 34:40.476
I am breathless
with anticipation.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.013
So what have you
learned, Detective?

34:43.014 --> 34:44.947
Mrs. Bell,

34:44.949 --> 34:48.251
you say you detected a communication

34:48.253 --> 34:50.520
between Mr. Thornton and Miss Keller

34:50.522 --> 34:53.857
just prior to the footsteps being heard.

34:53.859 --> 34:56.326
And that constitutes your alibi, does it not?

34:56.328 --> 34:59.529
That is right.
In fact, the message occurred

34:59.531 --> 35:02.933
seconds before the killer's
footsteps could be heard.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.801
What's your point, Detective?

35:04.803 --> 35:07.003
The footsteps began

35:07.005 --> 35:08.939
at the center of the table.

35:08.941 --> 35:11.174
You're not suggesting that--
Your wife is the only person

35:11.176 --> 35:14.144
whose actions cannot be heard
on that recording.
What?

35:14.146 --> 35:16.480
It cannot be her, sir!

35:16.482 --> 35:18.648
What is happening?

35:18.650 --> 35:20.550
What you don't know, Detective,

35:20.552 --> 35:22.552
is that the illness

35:22.554 --> 35:24.554
that stole my wife's hearing

35:24.556 --> 35:27.557
also destroyed
her sense of balance.

35:27.559 --> 35:30.026
If she walks without
visual reference

35:30.028 --> 35:32.829
she will fall over.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.664
(laughing)

35:34.666 --> 35:37.701
So what's your theory
now, Detective?

35:37.703 --> 35:42.072
It was not Mabel!
Why do you say that?

35:42.074 --> 35:44.141
Because the killer walked behind me.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.510
I'm afraid that's impossible.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.345
Oh, this is too good!

35:48.347 --> 35:50.480
If Miss Keller says
a man walked behind her,

35:50.482 --> 35:52.716
you can be assured
she is telling the truth.

35:55.853 --> 35:58.822
George, if you would.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.625
Miss Keller,

36:01.627 --> 36:03.660
would you please
tell us when you feel

36:03.662 --> 36:05.762
someone walking behind you?

36:08.566 --> 36:11.968
Now.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.675
Now.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.744
(chuckling)

36:20.746 --> 36:24.347
So, now what is
your theory, Detective?

36:24.349 --> 36:26.183
I've concluded that the killer

36:26.185 --> 36:28.852
was never sitting
at the table at all.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.656
The killer was standing
the entire time.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.060
You think I did it?

36:37.062 --> 36:39.362
You knew the dinner was being recorded.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.298
Once the lights went out

36:41.300 --> 36:44.201
you walked slowly, softly,

36:44.203 --> 36:46.736
to the edge of the carpet

36:46.738 --> 36:48.772
and behind Miss Keller,

36:48.774 --> 36:52.242
not knowing that she would
sense your presence.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.077
You then proceeded--

36:54.079 --> 36:55.879
This is absurd!
Can you prove

36:55.881 --> 36:58.582
it didn't happen that way?

36:58.584 --> 37:01.818
No, but--
Then be quiet, please,

37:01.820 --> 37:04.621
and let me do my job.

37:07.091 --> 37:09.459
In answer to your question,

37:09.461 --> 37:11.695
I believe the killer did come

37:11.697 --> 37:13.730
from the opposite side of the table.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.066
But sir, I thought
that was impossible.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.934
We thought that was impossible

37:17.936 --> 37:20.670
because we only heard
eight footsteps.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.639
It would be impossible

37:22.641 --> 37:24.674
for someone to circumnavigate a table

37:24.676 --> 37:27.110
of this size in eight footsteps.

37:27.112 --> 37:30.146
And how could the killer
travel such a great distance

37:30.148 --> 37:32.182
in complete darkness?

37:32.184 --> 37:34.084
Unless...

37:34.086 --> 37:35.952
unless...

37:35.954 --> 37:38.822
the killer

37:38.824 --> 37:41.157
used the edge of the carpet

37:41.159 --> 37:43.660
to navigate.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.329
The killer took

37:46.331 --> 37:50.433
eight footsteps

37:50.435 --> 37:54.104
but we only heard four.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.106
At the end of those eight steps,

37:56.108 --> 37:58.475
the killer struck.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.477
The killer then took

38:00.479 --> 38:04.180
another eight steps to return
to his seat, but not before

38:04.182 --> 38:06.516
touching these three people

38:06.518 --> 38:08.685
on the shoulder

38:08.687 --> 38:11.354
in order to set up Mr. Carmondy

38:11.356 --> 38:13.256
for the crime.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.059
Which was your intent

38:16.061 --> 38:18.061
all along.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.196
Wasn't it?

38:23.701 --> 38:25.702
Are you saying I'm the killer?

38:25.704 --> 38:28.872
Oh, no, no, that's impossible.
We were having a conversation.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.874
Begging your pardon, Miss Newsome,

38:30.876 --> 38:33.810
but you were having a conversation.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.913
A conversation that was initiated by Mr. Wilson

38:36.915 --> 38:39.516
but one that he only participated in

38:39.518 --> 38:41.918
after the last of the killer's

38:41.920 --> 38:43.887
footsteps were heard.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.189
No, but I--
Miss Newsome,

38:46.191 --> 38:49.559
has your fiancé ever expressed
an interest in your roses?

38:49.561 --> 38:52.462
Oh, no. He finds it
all terribly boring.

38:52.464 --> 38:55.899
He... he calls it my...
"blah blah blah."

38:55.901 --> 38:57.901
"Blah blah blah" indeed.
This is ridiculous.

38:57.903 --> 39:00.103
How would I have found him
in complete darkness?

39:00.105 --> 39:02.072
Practice, Mr. Wilson.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.674
After all, you helped
organize this dinner,

39:04.676 --> 39:07.077
did you not? You had access
to this very table

39:07.079 --> 39:09.279
every night for the past week.

39:09.281 --> 39:12.082
And why would I kill a man
I'd never met?

39:12.084 --> 39:15.185
That's a good question.
I believe the answer lies
in your recent engagement.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.588
What about our engagement?
Mr. Wilson,

39:18.590 --> 39:21.891
why are you
marrying Miss Newsome?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.893
Well, because...

39:23.895 --> 39:25.795
I love her.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.565
What specifically do you
love about her?

39:28.567 --> 39:31.901
Well, her... her... beauty,
of course,

39:31.903 --> 39:34.404
and her... her...
Her money?

39:34.406 --> 39:37.040
I have my own money.
You had money, Mr. Wilson.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.376
You've since lost it all.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.778
Is that true?

39:41.780 --> 39:43.646
And you've gone
to great lengths

39:43.648 --> 39:46.916
to set up Mr. Carmondy
for a crime.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.652
But why would you do that?

39:49.654 --> 39:51.621
Could it be that you've lost

39:51.623 --> 39:53.623
all of your money
investing in a machine

39:53.625 --> 39:56.459
that allows the dead to talk?

39:56.461 --> 39:59.662
Mr. Carmondy, who are your investors?

39:59.664 --> 40:02.732
I don't know off-hand.
No matter. Easy enough

40:02.734 --> 40:05.135
to find out. Henry, could you
dig a little deeper

40:05.137 --> 40:08.838
into Mr. Wilson's finances?
Gladly, sir!

40:12.843 --> 40:15.412
(exclamations of surprise)
Watch out!

40:15.414 --> 40:18.948
(grunting)

40:18.950 --> 40:21.251
GET OFF OF ME! STOP!

40:21.253 --> 40:23.620
STOP!

40:23.622 --> 40:26.790
Miss Keller!
(screaming)

40:26.792 --> 40:29.259
All right. You've got me.

40:29.261 --> 40:32.529
It's over.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.533
I'm not sorry.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.135
He got what he deserved.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.871
As would have you.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.641
I lost a fortune
because you were too stupid

40:44.643 --> 40:47.544
to see the truth.
And as for you?

40:47.546 --> 40:50.413
I hate roses.

40:50.415 --> 40:52.615
And I would frankly rather go
to the noose

40:52.617 --> 40:55.351
than be married
to someone as boring

40:55.353 --> 40:57.887
and vacuous as you.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.457
Oh...

41:00.459 --> 41:01.724
Oh!

41:01.726 --> 41:04.594
(Murdoch): Henry!
(Mr. Fellows): Bravo!

41:06.363 --> 41:08.364
(romantic music)

41:08.366 --> 41:10.967
♪

41:12.903 --> 41:14.971
Oh, Henry!

41:20.611 --> 41:22.612
Well Detective Murdoch,
once again our partnership

41:22.614 --> 41:25.114
has produced results.
Indeed.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.283
And once again, I must say
thank you for your help.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.686
Perhaps we could

41:29.688 --> 41:32.755
develop this stereoscopic sound
you've invented.

41:32.757 --> 41:36.292
Oh, I don't see
there being much use for it,

41:36.294 --> 41:38.995
except, of course,
in solving crime.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.997
Maybe so,

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
but if you'd ever
like to work together again,

41:43.001 --> 41:45.001
just say the word. Hm?

41:45.003 --> 41:47.570
I'll give you a hand.
Ah!

41:53.711 --> 41:56.479
I wonder if she'll
ever forgive me.

41:56.481 --> 41:58.548
Of course she will.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.316
It wasn't you that broke her heart.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.318
She needs some time to learn

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
to trust you again.

42:04.322 --> 42:07.156
I'll fetch her.

42:18.969 --> 42:21.604
Your carriage is here.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.640
Don't forget what I told you

42:23.642 --> 42:25.642
the other night.

42:25.644 --> 42:27.477
Don't let one man's barbarity

42:27.479 --> 42:29.479
keep you from
embracing everything

42:29.481 --> 42:31.481
that life has to offer.

42:31.483 --> 42:33.383
I won't.

42:35.319 --> 42:37.387
Though I doubt
I'll ever love again.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.289
You've surprised the world

42:39.291 --> 42:41.224
with your strength and resilience.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.726
You may yet surprise yourself.

42:49.833 --> 42:52.135
I'm right here, Helen.
Your leg.

42:57.675 --> 43:00.510
Thank you.

43:00.512 --> 43:03.079
A remarkable woman.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.684
We can go.

43:07.686 --> 43:10.587
To live in a world

43:10.589 --> 43:12.488
without sight and sound!

43:12.490 --> 43:14.424
All of your other senses

43:14.426 --> 43:16.326
would have to be heightened.

43:16.328 --> 43:19.095
Taste, touch --

43:19.097 --> 43:21.497
everything would be magnified.

43:21.499 --> 43:23.566
Did you feel that at dinner?

43:23.568 --> 43:25.568
Yes. Yes, I did.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.470
Well, that's good.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.339
Why do you say that?

43:29.341 --> 43:31.741
Because...

43:31.743 --> 43:34.210
I bought us a blindfold.

43:34.212 --> 43:37.347
And I have an idea
for a little experiment.

43:37.349 --> 43:39.616
Oh, my.
