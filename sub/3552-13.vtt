WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:03.134
I'M DONE FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF.

00:03.134 --> 00:05.176
LYNETTE MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:05.176 --> 00:07.308
I NEED TO START DATING AGAIN.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.111
BUT HER FIRST ATTEMPT...
 OH, THE SALMON LOOKS GOOD.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.312
AT A STEAK HOUSE?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.144
WAS A DISASTER.

00:13.144 --> 00:16.087
THE STRESS OF COVERING UP
A CRIME...

00:16.087 --> 00:18.389
YOU TOLD US THAT AS LONG
AS WE TRUSTED EACH OTHER,

00:18.389 --> 00:20.391
EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!

00:20.391 --> 00:24.155
DROVE A WEDGE BETWEEN BREE
AND HER FRIENDS...

00:24.155 --> 00:27.198
A NIGHT OUT IS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU NEED TO LIFT YOUR SPIRITS.

00:27.198 --> 00:30.101
LEADING HER BACK
TO AN OLD ADDICTION

00:37.238 --> 00:42.042
(Mary Alice) BEING IN LOVE CAN
BRING OUT THE WORST IN PEOPLE.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.045
THEY MAY BECOME STINGY...

00:45.045 --> 00:50.050
OR HOSTILE...

00:50.050 --> 00:55.326
OR SIMPLY INDIFFERENT.

00:55.326 --> 01:00.191
BUT IN THE BEGINNING
WHEN LOVE IS STILL A PROMISE,

01:00.191 --> 01:03.334
PEOPLE BRING THEIR BEST
TO THE TABLE.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.436
HERE'S TO SECOND CHANCES.
 (clink)

01:05.436 --> 01:10.441
OH, HERE'S TO YOU
FOR GIVING ME A SECOND CHANCE.

01:10.441 --> 01:14.074
I REALLY... DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE SO NICE ON THE PHONE.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.178
I GUESS YOU WERE CHARMED
BY MY GROVELING.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.310
(chuckles) BUT NOW
I'M KIND OF IN A PICKLE.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.112
I SPENT THE LAST WEEK
COMPLAINING

01:21.112 --> 01:22.413
ABOUT THE CRAZY BITCH
I WENT OUT WITH.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.315
NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK
AND TELL EVERYONE

01:24.315 --> 01:26.357
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DATES
OF MY LIFE.

01:26.357 --> 01:29.420
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.322
AH, NOT SO FAST.
WE HAVEN'T HAD DESSERT YET.

01:31.322 --> 01:33.124
WE STILL COULD BLOW IT.

01:33.124 --> 01:35.196
OH. (chuckles)
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.229
WELL... HOW ABOUT WE GET
OUTTA HERE?

01:38.229 --> 01:40.231
WE COULD HAVE DESSERT
AT MY PLACE.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.203
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.307
SO I HAVE
HALF AN APPLE PIE.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.478
I'VE GOT SOME
OF THOSE LITTLE PUDDING CUPS,

01:47.478 --> 01:49.380
AND I THINK THERE ARE
SOME ICE CREAM SANDWICHES

01:49.380 --> 01:50.481
IN THE FREEZER.

01:50.481 --> 01:52.443
OH.

01:52.443 --> 01:56.387
COME ON.
WHO CAN RESIST A PUDDING CUP?

01:56.387 --> 02:00.191
NO, I-IT'S JUST...

02:00.191 --> 02:02.253
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU
ACTUALLY INVITED ME OVER HERE

02:02.253 --> 02:05.156
FOR... DESSERT.

02:05.156 --> 02:08.158
OH. DESSERT.

02:08.158 --> 02:09.400
YOU THOUGHT I MEANT...

02:09.400 --> 02:11.131
SEX.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.236
RIGHT. THAT'S... WHY
YOU RAN ALL THOSE RED LIGHTS.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.208
I FIGURED YOU HAD
A SWEET TOOTH.

02:17.208 --> 02:20.241
YEAH.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.213
SO JUST THE THREE CHOICES?

02:24.445 --> 02:26.146
I THINK SO.

02:27.448 --> 02:30.281
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I LOVE DESSERT--BOTH KINDS.

02:30.281 --> 02:31.482
(closes door)
 IT'S JUST SO SOON,

02:31.482 --> 02:33.524
AND IT'S ONLY
OUR SECOND DATE.

02:33.524 --> 02:35.256
ONLY THE FIRST ONE
THAT'S GONE WELL--

02:35.256 --> 02:36.527
I GET IT. NO PROBLEM.

02:36.527 --> 02:39.430
PLUS THERE'S A CERTAIN...
AMOUNT OF PREP WORK INVOLVED

02:39.430 --> 02:41.192
THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE
HAD I KNOWN

02:41.192 --> 02:43.494
WE WERE THINKING OF--
AND I DIDN'T MAKE MY BED,

02:43.494 --> 02:45.165
AND THERE ARE
NO CLEAN TOWELS.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.367
I MISUNDERSTOOD.

02:47.438 --> 02:49.340
AND NOW I'VE MADE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.272
I'M SO SORRY.
 NO.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.274
WE HAD A GREAT NIGHT.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.375
YES.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.207
I LOOK FORWARD
TO DOING IT AGAIN.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.209
OH, YES. SOUNDS GOOD.

02:58.209 --> 02:59.380
OKAY.

02:59.380 --> 03:03.183
JUST... PLEASE DON'T THINK
THAT THIS MEANS

03:03.183 --> 03:05.216
I NEVER WANNA HAVE SEX WITH YOU,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GREAT,

03:05.216 --> 03:07.388
AND--AND SEX IS GREAT.
I LOVE SEX.
 (door opens)

03:07.388 --> 03:10.190
I ALWAYS HAVE.
I WAS A TOTAL WHORE IN COLLEGE.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.423
(both laugh)

03:12.423 --> 03:15.466
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I GUESS
THIS IS GOOD NIGHT, THEN.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.268
OKAY. GOOD NIGHT.

03:17.268 --> 03:23.203
YES, THE PROMISE OF LOVE
CAN BRING OUT THE BEST IN US...

03:23.203 --> 03:28.409
UNLESS WE FIND THAT
WE'RE A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE.

03:28.409 --> 03:41.221
(exhales deeply)

03:41.221 --> 03:42.353
AFTER A DISASTER,

03:42.353 --> 03:46.357
EVERY HOUSEWIFE
HAS HER OWN WAY OF COPING.

03:46.357 --> 03:49.430
SOME TURN TO DRINK...

03:51.231 --> 03:55.466
SOME TURN TO SWEETS...

03:55.466 --> 03:59.370
AND SOME TURN TO THE PEOPLE
THEY TRUST THE MOST.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.312
(beeps)

04:01.312 --> 04:03.444
SO THEN I SAID I'D LOVE
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.476
BUT I'M NOT SURE I'M READY YET,
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:05.476 --> 04:07.548
THIS AWKWARD THING
HANGING OVER US.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.481
NOBODY EXPECTS YOU TO HOP
RIGHT INTO BED WITH SOMEONE NEW.

04:10.481 --> 04:11.582
WHY NOT? TOM DID.

04:13.284 --> 04:15.286
I'M JUST TRYING TO MOTIVATE HER.

04:15.286 --> 04:17.257
TO DO WHAT?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.589
HAVE RANDOM SEX
WITH THE FIRST GUY SHE MEETS?

04:19.589 --> 04:21.291
YOU DON'T WANNA BE
THAT GIRL.

04:21.291 --> 04:24.295
YEAH, BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS
LIKE TOO MUCH FUN.

04:24.295 --> 04:26.266
SUSAN, LYNETTE IS PUSHING 50.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.299
WITH A VERY LONG STICK.

04:28.299 --> 04:29.640
POINT IS, SHE SHOULD BE
OUT THERE GETTING SOME

04:29.640 --> 04:32.373
WHILE SHE'S STILL LIMBER ENOUGH
TO ENJOY IT.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.604
ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ON MY SIDE HERE?

04:33.604 --> 04:35.346
OF COURSE.

04:35.346 --> 04:38.509
FIRST THINGS FIRST--
DO YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GUY?

04:38.509 --> 04:41.352
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

04:41.352 --> 04:42.483
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

04:42.483 --> 04:43.654
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
I'M A LITTLE RUSTY.

04:43.654 --> 04:45.356
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

04:45.356 --> 04:46.657
THE LAST GUY
WHO SAW ME NAKED

04:46.657 --> 04:50.361
TOLD ME NOT TO WAIT SO LONG
BETWEEN PAP SMEARS.

04:50.361 --> 04:51.492
OH.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.293
OKAY, YOU'RE PUTTING
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOURSELF,

04:53.293 --> 04:54.495
AND IF YOU REALLY
LIKE THIS GUY,

04:54.495 --> 04:55.666
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT SLOW.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.468
YEAH, BUT NOT TOO SLOW.

04:57.468 --> 04:58.499
YOU'RE STARTING
A NEW RELATIONSHIP,

04:58.499 --> 05:00.300
AND SEX IS A BIG PART OF IT.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.403
YOU DON'T BUY A CAR
WITHOUT GIVING IT A TEST DRIVE.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.506
SO DRIVE THIS GUY, LYNETTE.
DRIVE HIM HARD.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.580
SO... HOW MUCH LONGER
IS CARLOS GONNA BE IN REHAB?

05:09.580 --> 05:11.412
14 1/2 DAYS.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.313
I DON'T KNOW.
THE FIRST TIME WITH SOMEBODY

05:13.313 --> 05:15.686
IS ALWAYS AWKWARD AND WEIRD.

05:15.686 --> 05:18.619
AND EXCITING AND GREAT.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.351
COME ON.
IN 20 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

05:20.351 --> 05:21.622
YOU NEVER FANTASIZED
ABOUT BEING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.525
CONSTANTLY. SOMETIMES DURING.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.497
WELL, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

05:26.497 --> 05:28.429
HUH.
I GUESS THIS IS THE UPSIDE

05:28.429 --> 05:30.501
TO HAVING
YOUR MARRIAGE COLLAPSE.

05:30.501 --> 05:34.535
OKAY. I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE MY FIRST MOVE.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.606
(door closes in distance)

05:35.606 --> 05:38.469
I KNOW WHO COULD
GIVE YOU SOME TIPS.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.613
(Gaby) OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT ANOTHER ONE?

05:42.613 --> 05:45.476
I KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BLOND GUY FROM LAST WEEK?

05:45.476 --> 05:48.479
BLOND GUY? THE GUY I SAW HAD
DARK HAIR AND A SPORTS CAR.

05:48.479 --> 05:50.381
THE GUY I SAW
DROVE A MOTORCYCLE.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.453
WHAT IS THAT,
FIVE GUYS IN A WEEK?

05:52.453 --> 05:54.425
IS SHE STARTING
A BASKETBALL TEAM?

05:56.427 --> 05:58.389
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED
ABOUT HER?

05:58.389 --> 06:00.631
AFTER THE WAY SHE TREATED US,
UNH-UNH.
 (truck door opens and closes)

06:00.631 --> 06:02.693
SHE'S NOT OUR PROBLEM
ANYMORE.

06:02.693 --> 06:06.397
(both chuckle)

06:07.568 --> 06:10.370
WHO ARE THESE WOMEN
STARING AT US?

06:12.443 --> 06:14.475
NOBODY I KNOW.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.510
JUANITA, WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON GIVING OUT VALENTINE CUPCAKES

06:19.510 --> 06:21.582
WHEN I BOUGHT YOU A BOX
OF PERFECTLY GOOD CARDS?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.514
STORE-BOUGHT CARDS ARE LAME.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.486
WHO CARES? I COULD BE
WATCHING TV RIGHT NOW

06:25.486 --> 06:26.717
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CRAM
THE NAME "HARRISON"

06:26.717 --> 06:28.659
ONTO A CUPCAKE.

06:28.659 --> 06:32.593
I WISH DADDY WAS HERE.
HE ALWAYS HELPS ME WITH STUFF.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.395
YOU REALLY MISS HIM, HUH?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.599
YEAH. WHY'D HE HAVE TO GO
TO STUPID EUROPE, ANYWAY?

06:38.599 --> 06:42.433
WELL, YOU KNOW, BUSINESS TRIPS
ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.676
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM...
BUSINESS TRIPS.

06:45.676 --> 06:47.438
BUT HE'S NEVER
BEEN GONE THIS LONG.

06:47.438 --> 06:48.739
IT FEELS LIKE FOREVER.

06:48.739 --> 06:50.611
I KNOW,
BUT WHEN HE GETS HOME,

06:50.611 --> 06:53.413
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE GREAT AGAIN.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.616
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE
OF THOSE SPRINKLES?

06:55.616 --> 06:59.490
YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME
ON THAT ONE CUPCAKE.

06:59.490 --> 07:00.651
IS IT FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL?

07:00.651 --> 07:03.694
NO, IT'S FOR NOBODY.

07:03.694 --> 07:05.596
JUANITA, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

07:05.596 --> 07:06.627
HE DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.729
HA! SO YOU ADMIT HE EXISTS.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.801
(sighs) FINE.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.763
HIS NAME IS RYAN VAYO.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.806
HE'S SO COOL.
HE CAN DISLOCATE HIS SHOULDER

07:15.806 --> 07:18.509
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

07:18.509 --> 07:21.612
MM. YOU AND ME--
WE GO FOR THE BAD BOYS.

07:21.612 --> 07:24.615
SO I JUST WANT IT TO BE SPECIAL.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S DUMB?

07:24.615 --> 07:28.649
NO. I THINK YOU NEED
MORE CANDY HEARTS.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.721
(candy rattles)

07:34.585 --> 07:36.587
HEY, I'VE BEEN, UH,
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK.

07:36.587 --> 07:38.458
DO WE HAVE ANY CEREAL?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.830
IT'S FOR JULIE.

07:39.830 --> 07:41.692
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE?

07:41.692 --> 07:42.793
WHEN SHE WAS A KID,

07:42.793 --> 07:45.596
OUR FAVORITE THING
WAS TO HAVE CEREAL DINNER.

07:45.596 --> 07:47.798
BUT I COULDN'T REMEMBER
HER FAVORITE, SO I GOT 'EM ALL.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.740
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS

07:49.740 --> 07:51.702
SINCE SHE'S BEEN HOME.

07:51.702 --> 07:52.743
YEAH. WHY THE VISIT?

07:52.743 --> 07:54.575
I THINK SHE JUST MISSES
HER MOM.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.607
SHE SOUNDED A LITTLE BLUE
ON THE PHONE.

07:56.607 --> 07:58.679
WELL, WE SHOULD THINK OF
SOME STUFF TO CHEER HER UP.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.681
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.553
WE ARE GONNA DO
ALL THE THINGS

08:02.553 --> 08:03.854
SHE LOVED TO DO
WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

08:03.854 --> 08:06.857
OH, HEY. DO WE STILL HAVE
THAT TRAMPOLINE IN THE GARAGE?

08:06.857 --> 08:09.760
SHE WOULD JUMP ON THAT THING
FOR HOURS.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.692
I WOULD BE UP IN MY ROOM,
READING,

08:11.692 --> 08:13.564
AND HER HEAD WOULD KEEP
POPPING UP IN THE WINDOW.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.826
"HI, MOM. HI, MOM.
HI, MOM."

08:15.826 --> 08:18.498
(Julie) HI, MOM.
 OH! (gasps) JULIE.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.500
HI. HEY, MIKE.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.872
HEY, KIDDO.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

08:21.872 --> 08:24.705
OH, YOU DO.
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.876
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

08:25.876 --> 08:27.678
UH, YEAH, SURE, SOME WATER.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.540
OH.
 HERE.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.812
WE ARE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN THIS WEEK.

08:31.812 --> 08:32.883
I THOUGHT WE'D START
AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK

08:32.883 --> 08:35.746
WITH SOME HIGH-RISK
ROLLER COASTERING.

08:35.746 --> 08:36.746
UH... SUSAN?

08:36.746 --> 08:40.591
AND THEN I AM GONNA
TAKE YOU

08:40.591 --> 08:42.753
TO MY KICK-ASS
KICKBOXING CLASS.

08:42.753 --> 08:44.555
YEAH... UH, BABE?

08:44.555 --> 08:45.756
AND TO TOP IT OFF,

08:45.756 --> 08:47.728
MIKE IS GONNA DIG OUT THAT
TRAMPOLINE SO THAT YOU CAN--

08:47.728 --> 08:49.600
OH, MY GOD!

08:49.600 --> 08:52.733
YEAH.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.566
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE
NEEDING THAT TRAMPOLINE.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.675
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

09:04.675 --> 09:06.847
YOU'RE... PREGNANT.

09:06.847 --> 09:10.020
YEAH. SIX MONTHS.

09:10.020 --> 09:14.885
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME
YOU WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

09:16.787 --> 09:19.029
OH, GOD.

09:19.029 --> 09:20.961
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE GUY?

09:20.961 --> 09:22.693
I'M GONNA HATE HIM,
AREN'T I?

09:22.693 --> 09:25.936
NO, 'CAUSE...
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MEET HIM.

09:27.798 --> 09:29.740
IT WAS JUST KIND OF
A CASUAL THING,

09:29.740 --> 09:32.943
AND HE'S NOT REALLY INTERESTED
IN FOLLOWING THROUGH.

09:32.943 --> 09:35.806
I WAS RIGHT.
I DO HATE HIM.

09:35.806 --> 09:38.779
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.711
MM, YEAH.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.012
YEAH, I AM.

09:42.012 --> 09:43.854
THEN WE ARE, TOO.

09:43.854 --> 09:46.016
OF COURSE. (chuckles)

09:46.016 --> 09:48.889
AND WE ARE GONNA BE HERE
FOR YOU.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.060
YOU CAN MOVE BACK HOME,

09:50.060 --> 09:52.993
AND MIKE AND I WILL HELP
TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.925
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T EVEN ASK.

09:54.925 --> 09:57.768
IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?

09:57.768 --> 09:59.700
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.873
I'M GIVING IT UP
FOR ADOPTION.

10:02.873 --> 10:04.975
WHAT?

10:04.975 --> 10:07.007
(scoffs)
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.939
MOM, LOOK AT MY LIFE.

10:08.939 --> 10:10.741
I-I LIVE
IN A CRAPPY APARTMENT.

10:10.741 --> 10:13.043
I'M WORKING PART-TIME
WHILE I FINISH MY PhD.

10:13.043 --> 10:15.716
BUT YOU ALWAYS SAID
YOU WANTED CHILDREN.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.048
YEAH, WITH A HUSBAND.
(scoffs)

10:18.048 --> 10:20.020
I'M NOT IN A PLACE
TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.755
NO, NO, NO. SLOW DOWN.
WE NEED TO THINK THIS THROUGH.

10:24.755 --> 10:26.096
I ALREADY HAVE.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.859
AND I'M WORKING
WITH THIS AGENCY,

10:28.859 --> 10:30.000
AND THEY SET UP A MEETING
WITH A GREAT COUPLE

10:30.000 --> 10:31.862
WHO DOESN'T LIVE
TOO FAR FROM HERE.

10:31.862 --> 10:33.934
OH, GOD.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.106
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET THEM
TOMORROW NIGHT,

10:36.106 --> 10:39.970
AND THEY WANNA MEET YOU, TOO,
TO LEARN ABOUT MY BACKGROUND.

10:39.970 --> 10:45.075
SO THAT'S WHY YOU CAME HOME--
NOT JUST TO BREAK MY HEART.

10:47.778 --> 10:51.852
OKAY, WELL, GUESS WHAT?
NO ONE IS MEETING ANYONE,

10:51.852 --> 10:53.884
AND NO ONE IS GOING TO
GIVE AWAY THIS BABY.

10:53.884 --> 10:54.985
SUSAN.

10:54.985 --> 10:57.988
MOM, YOU JUST SAID
YOU'D BE THERE FOR ME.

10:57.988 --> 11:00.090
I REALLY NEED
YOUR SUPPORT.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.794
PLEASE?

11:06.767 --> 11:10.971
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.
WE'LL HAVE THEM OVER FOR DINNER.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.804
(whispers) THANK YOU.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.880
HAPPY SUCKY VALENTINE'S DAY.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.111
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:21.111 --> 11:23.814
RYAN DIDN'T LIKE
YOUR CUPCAKE?

11:23.814 --> 11:28.058
HE ATE IT, BUT HE DIDN'T
EVEN GIVE ME A CARD.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.060
OH, WHO CARES ABOUT HIM?

11:30.060 --> 11:32.993
PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE
GAVE YOU VALENTINES.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.896
(box lid clatters)
 LIKE JACOB.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.929
"DEAR JUANITA, MY PARENTS...
MADE ME WRITE THIS.

11:38.929 --> 11:41.031
YOU SMELL LIKE HAM."

11:42.803 --> 11:44.174
WELL, YOU LIKE HAM.

11:44.174 --> 11:47.137
I LIKE RYAN.
WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE ME?

11:47.137 --> 11:48.909
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

11:48.909 --> 11:53.183
NOTHING IS WRONG WITH YOU.
YOU ARE WONDERFUL. COME HERE.

11:53.183 --> 11:54.985
OH.

11:57.888 --> 12:02.022
HEY, SWEETIE, ARE YOU SURE
RYAN DIDN'T GIVE YOU A CARD?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.093
YEAH.

12:03.093 --> 12:05.195
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR BACKPACK.

12:05.195 --> 12:07.157
HE COULD HAVE SLIPPED IT IN
WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.959
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

12:08.959 --> 12:11.932
BOYS ARE WEIRD. (chuckles)
TAKE A LOOK.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.971
(whispers) PEN, PEN, PEN, PEN.

12:20.971 --> 12:22.943
NO.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.084
(blows air)

12:35.225 --> 12:36.987
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:36.987 --> 12:41.131
NOTHING. (chuckles)
HEY, WHAT'S, UH, WHAT'S THAT?

12:41.131 --> 12:42.232
WHAT?

12:42.232 --> 12:45.195
THAT THING THAT JUST
FELL OUT OF YOUR BACKPACK.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.871
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
IT'S FROM HIM.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.004
"HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.
X.O.X.O. RYAN."

12:54.004 --> 12:55.075
WHAT'S "X.O.X.O."?

12:55.075 --> 12:56.947
HUGS AND KISSES.

12:56.947 --> 13:00.981
HUGS AND KISSES?
OH, HE DOES LIKE ME.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.983
I'M GOING TO CALL HIM.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.114
NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

13:04.114 --> 13:06.156
DON'T DO THAT!
 AND WHY NOT?

13:06.156 --> 13:08.258
BECAUSE BOYS DON'T LIKE IT

13:08.258 --> 13:10.961
WHEN GIRLS TELL THEM
THEY LIKE THEM.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.963
THEN HOW WILL HE KNOW?

13:12.963 --> 13:14.064
OH, SWEETIE,
HE KNOWS, YOU KNOW,

13:14.064 --> 13:15.996
SO NEITHER OF YOU
NEED TO SAY IT.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.098
IT'S MUCH MORE ROMANTIC
THIS WAY.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.030
I'M SERIOUS.
DON'T TALK TO HIM, EVER.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.132
IT'LL WRECK
THE RELATIONSHIP.

13:22.132 --> 13:23.233
BUT... IF WE DON'T TALK,

13:23.233 --> 13:25.205
WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
IS THAT?

13:25.205 --> 13:28.909
THE VERY BEST KIND.
(chuckles)

13:28.909 --> 13:30.981
OH, MY GOD. IS THIS...

13:32.983 --> 13:36.216
CHOCOLATE? HE'S PERFECT!

13:36.216 --> 13:38.949
(sighs)

13:38.949 --> 13:42.052
SUSAN, THIS WAS DELICIOUS.

13:42.052 --> 13:44.124
AH, JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
I WHIPPED UP.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.958
A TOAST TO JULIE AND SUSAN
FOR INVITING US

13:47.958 --> 13:49.259
INTO YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOME,
AND OFFERING US

13:49.259 --> 13:52.032
THIS AMAZING GIFT OF LIFE.

13:52.032 --> 13:56.166
(clinking)

13:56.166 --> 13:59.139
YOU'RE NOT DRINKING, DEBBIE?

13:59.139 --> 14:04.044
OH. I'M ABSTAINING IN A SHOW
OF SOLIDARITY WITH JULIE.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.116
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CARRY
MY OWN BABY,

14:06.116 --> 14:08.278
BUT I CAN SUPPORT
THE WOMAN WHO IS.

14:08.278 --> 14:11.982
OH, THAT'S SWEET.
BUT WORD OF ADVICE--

14:11.982 --> 14:15.025
DROP THAT PLAN WHEN THE DOCTOR
STARTS TALKING EPISIOTOMY.

14:15.025 --> 14:18.188
OH. (laughs)
 (laughs)

14:18.188 --> 14:21.962
SUSAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GREAT
YOU'RE BEING ABOUT THIS.
 YEAH.

14:21.962 --> 14:25.095
IT'S WONDERFUL THAT
YOUR MOTHER IS SO SUPPORTIVE.

14:25.095 --> 14:28.298
YEAH, WELL, SHE UNDERSTANDS
HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

14:28.298 --> 14:31.171
SO MUCH BETTER FOR EVERYONE.

14:31.171 --> 14:34.044
ABSOLUTELY. CAN'T THINK OF
A BETTER HOME FOR THIS BABY

14:34.044 --> 14:35.976
THAN WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.978
OH.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.079
(sighs)

14:40.350 --> 14:44.054
JULIE, DO YOU MIND
GETTING THE DESSERT?

14:44.054 --> 14:45.255
OH, SURE. (clears throat)

14:45.255 --> 14:48.058
AND, DEBBIE, IF YOU'RE PEEING
IN SOLIDARITY WITH ME,

14:48.058 --> 14:50.060
THEN, UH, THAT'S WHERE
I'LL BE HEADING FIRST.

14:50.060 --> 14:51.061
(laughs)
 (chuckles)

14:51.061 --> 14:52.993
AW.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.165
YOU HAVE DONE
AN INCREDIBLE JOB WITH HER.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.027
SHE SEEMS GREAT.

14:57.027 --> 15:00.300
YEAH. SHE'S HAVING
ONE OF HER GOOD DAYS.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.374
HER GOOD DAYS?

15:04.374 --> 15:11.141
YEAH. SEEMS DR. COHEN FINALLY
GOT HER MEDS PERFECTLY BALANCED.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.313
IT'S WHY I'M LETTING HER
USE A KNIFE TONIGHT.

15:13.313 --> 15:17.147
WAIT. MEDS?
SHE NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING

15:17.147 --> 15:19.149
ON HER APPLICATION
ABOUT--

15:19.149 --> 15:20.220
MENTAL ILLNESS?

15:21.251 --> 15:24.024
(sighs) YEAH.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.225
GRANDMA USED TO SAY
OUR FAMILY TREE

15:25.225 --> 15:27.357
GREW NOTHING BUT BANANAS...

15:29.159 --> 15:31.261
BEFORE SHE HUNG HERSELF.

15:32.362 --> 15:36.136
I THINK LEGALLY SHE HAD
TO DISCLOSE THIS TO US.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.368
OH, DON'T TALK TO JULIE
ABOUT LEGAL.

15:38.368 --> 15:42.312
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
ALL OF HER JAIL TATTOOS.

15:42.312 --> 15:44.044
(shaky voice) BILL?

15:44.044 --> 15:49.119
UM... WHAT ELSE
DIDN'T SHE TELL US?

15:49.119 --> 15:52.322
I DON'T KNOW.

15:52.322 --> 15:55.255
DID SHE TELL YOU
SHE CAN HOLD HER HAND

15:55.255 --> 15:58.328
OVER AN OPEN FLAME
WITHOUT CRYING?

15:58.328 --> 16:00.060
YEAH, HER EYES WATER,

16:00.060 --> 16:02.292
BUT SHE JUST KEEPS LAUGHING
AND LAUGHING.

16:02.292 --> 16:05.435
(chuckles)

16:05.435 --> 16:07.367
BUT IT'S NOT ALL HER FAULT.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.239
I SHOULD'VE STOPPED DRINKING
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT,

16:09.239 --> 16:12.342
BUT I LIKES MY WINE.
(chuckles)

16:12.342 --> 16:14.204
(Julie sighs)

16:14.204 --> 16:16.376
I'M BACK.
WHO'S READY FOR DESSERT?

16:16.376 --> 16:18.408
(blade zings)

16:26.016 --> 16:27.757
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:31.691 --> 16:32.692
(plate clatters)

16:32.692 --> 16:34.464
STILL NOT TALKING TO ME,
HUH?

16:34.464 --> 16:37.497
I'M CHANNELING MY ANGER
INTO CLEANING.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.628
WELL,
I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE,

16:38.628 --> 16:41.571
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT
UNTIL YOU TACKLE THE BATHROOM.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.575
YOU DO REALIZE THAT
SCARING THOSE PEOPLE OFF

16:45.575 --> 16:46.676
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.710
I'M HEALTHY. I'M WHITE.
I'M A YEAR AWAY FROM MY PhD.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.613
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MANY
PEOPLE WANT THIS BABY.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.486
INCLUDING ME.

16:58.048 --> 17:01.791
I'M SORRY.
IT'S MY GRANDCHILD.

17:01.791 --> 17:05.655
AND I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
YOU HAVE THOUGHT THIS ALL OUT,

17:05.655 --> 17:08.798
BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE HELD
THAT BABY IN YOUR ARMS,

17:08.798 --> 17:11.800
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE GIVING UP.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.762
I'M GOING TO BED.

17:13.762 --> 17:17.036
NO, PLEASE, HEAR ME OUT.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.638
YOU'RE SCARED. I GET IT.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.040
BUT YOU CAN DO THIS.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.542
I DON'T WANNA BE
A SINGLE MOTHER!

17:23.542 --> 17:25.044
WHY CAN'T YOU RESPECT THAT?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.717
IT'S NOT SO BAD
BEING A SINGLE MOTHER.

17:27.717 --> 17:29.779
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

17:29.779 --> 17:31.681
WE WERE LIKE BEST FRIENDS.

17:31.681 --> 17:34.053
REMEMBER? WE WOULD HAVE
CEREAL FOR DINNER,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.556
AND WE'D STAY UP
IN MY BED ALL NIGHT,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.658
TELLING EACH OTHER
OUR SECRETS.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.591
IT'S FUNNY YOU REMEMBER IT
THAT WAY,

17:41.591 --> 17:42.632
BECAUSE I DON'T.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.537
I WAS 12, MOM.

17:47.537 --> 17:49.599
I SLEPT IN YOUR BED
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T HANDLE

17:49.599 --> 17:51.070
LOOKING AT THE EMPTY SIDE.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.703
AND HOW ABOUT THOSE FUN DRIVES
PAST DAD'S APARTMENT

17:53.703 --> 17:56.676
TO SEE IF HE WAS
BRINGING ANYONE HOME?

17:56.676 --> 17:59.549
AND THE ONLY REASON
WE HAD CEREAL DINNER

17:59.549 --> 18:00.850
WAS BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY FOOD I COULD MAKE,

18:00.850 --> 18:02.852
SINCE YOU WERE TOO UPSET
TO COOK.

18:06.556 --> 18:09.789
(sighs) UH... WOW.

18:12.122 --> 18:14.093
I...

18:15.595 --> 18:17.627
I HAD NO IDEA.

18:17.627 --> 18:22.132
THAT IS WHY I DON'T WANNA
HAVE THIS BABY ON MY OWN.

18:23.673 --> 18:26.806
BECAUSE I ALREADY RAISED
A CHILD...

18:26.806 --> 18:28.778
YOU.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.788
(children shouting playfully)

18:44.154 --> 18:46.726
(kicking ball)

18:48.758 --> 18:50.860
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

18:50.860 --> 18:52.832
SHH. DON'T TALK.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.804
WHY NOT?

18:54.804 --> 18:56.736
YOU'LL RUIN
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.739
OH, WE DON'T HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.672
RIGHT, THAT'S WHY
YOU GAVE ME THE X-O's.

19:02.672 --> 19:05.175
X-O's? WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

19:05.175 --> 19:06.876
I'LL SHOW YOU.

19:06.876 --> 19:07.877
(makes kissing sound)

19:07.877 --> 19:10.750
SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.151
SHE'S A 9-YEAR-OLD
WITH A CRUSH,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.723
NOT A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL.

19:13.723 --> 19:15.885
REGARDLESS, HERE AT OAKRIDGE,

19:15.885 --> 19:20.630
WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY
FOR UNWANTED ADVANCES.

19:20.630 --> 19:23.733
HONEY, I WAS A MODEL. I KNOW
ALL ABOUT UNWANTED ADVANCES.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.836
TRY BEING BEING STUCK IN A LIMO
WITH A TIPSY DAVID LEE ROTH.

19:26.836 --> 19:31.641
YOUR DAUGHTER FORCED THIS BOY
TO THE GROUND AND KISSED HIM

19:31.641 --> 19:32.772
AGAINST HIS WILL.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.645
OH, AND WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH
BOYS HATE BEING KISSED.

19:35.645 --> 19:37.747
HE CRIED FOR 20 MINUTES.

19:37.747 --> 19:39.679
HE COULD BARELY TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.950
OH, SO HE'S A SNITCH
AND A CRYBABY.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.653
THAT KID'S NOT GONNA LAST
A DAY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

19:43.653 --> 19:47.857
MRS. SOLIS, I DON'T THINK
YOU REALIZE THE GRAVITY

19:47.857 --> 19:49.719
OF THIS SITUATION.

19:49.719 --> 19:52.692
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

19:52.692 --> 19:56.696
HEY, HEY, COTTON TOP,
YOU AND I ARE NOT THE SAME AGE.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.769
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR DAUGHTER,

19:59.769 --> 20:01.801
BECAUSE IF SHE
SO MUCH AS GLANCES

20:01.801 --> 20:03.733
IN THAT BOY'S DIRECTION AGAIN,

20:03.733 --> 20:07.237
WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO EXPEL HER.

20:09.239 --> 20:10.880
(sighs)

20:10.880 --> 20:13.883
(slow rock music playing)

20:13.883 --> 20:15.785
MMM.

20:15.785 --> 20:19.218
(man) ♪ HANGING OUT FOR YOU ♪

20:27.757 --> 20:29.829
(clears throat) HI.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.230
I DON'T USUALLY DO THIS,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.962
BUT I'M FEELING RATHER BOLD
TONIGHT.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.834
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.837
SURE.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.741
MATT,
DRINK FOR MY FRIEND HERE.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.972
WHAT'S YOUR POISON?

20:42.972 --> 20:45.845
WHISKEY, STRAIGHT UP.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.817
I'M BREE, BY THE WAY.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.949
(sighs)

20:49.949 --> 20:51.250
(whiskey pours)

20:51.250 --> 20:52.251
JERRY.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.884
JERRY.
NICE TO MEET YOU, JERRY.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.789
(chuckles)
NOT MUCH OF A TALKER, HUH?

20:59.789 --> 21:03.793
WELL, THAT'S OKAY.
I WILL ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS.

21:03.793 --> 21:05.865
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING,
JERRY?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.967
I'M A ROOFER.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.801
SAME THING I WAS
TWO NIGHTS AGO

21:11.801 --> 21:13.002
WHEN YOU TOOK ME HOME.

21:13.002 --> 21:17.006
JERRY.

21:17.006 --> 21:20.950
JERRY, I'M SO SORRY. OHH!
IT'S JUST SO DARK IN HERE,

21:20.950 --> 21:22.281
AND I--

21:22.281 --> 21:25.054
IT'S OKAY. IT HAPPENS,
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS CROWD.

21:25.054 --> 21:27.957
(both chuckle)

21:27.957 --> 21:32.291
WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
I WILL NOT FORGET YOU TWICE.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.769
IS THERE, UH, ANY WAY
I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

21:39.769 --> 21:42.031
WELL, I, UH...

21:42.031 --> 21:44.033
I DO REMEMBER
THE OTHER NIGHT.

21:44.033 --> 21:45.775
MM?

21:45.775 --> 21:48.007
AND, YEAH, YOU HAVE
SEVERAL WAYS.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.780
(chuckles)

21:50.780 --> 21:53.783
WELL, THEN, UM...

21:55.815 --> 21:57.847
LET'S NOT WASTE ANY TIME.

22:24.614 --> 22:27.917
HEY, KID. WANT A BEER?
OH, RIGHT.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.919
(chuckles)

22:29.919 --> 22:31.721
THANKS.

22:33.923 --> 22:38.588
IT'S SO WEIRD TO REMEMBER
BEING A KID HERE AND...

22:38.588 --> 22:39.889
NOW TO BE...

22:39.889 --> 22:41.931
(chuckles) YEAH, I'LL BET.

22:41.931 --> 22:44.864
IMAGINE HOW WEIRD IT IS
FOR YOUR MOM.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.597
I GET THAT.

22:47.597 --> 22:48.738
I JUST WISH SHE'D...

22:48.738 --> 22:50.770
JULIE,
IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO WISH

22:50.770 --> 22:53.743
THAT YOUR MOM WOULD STOP TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT YOUR LIFE FOR YOU,

22:53.743 --> 22:54.904
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WASTE
A WISH.

22:57.647 --> 22:59.979
SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE
KINDA ROUGH ON HER LAST NIGHT.

23:01.751 --> 23:03.953
I WAS.

23:03.953 --> 23:05.785
SHE TOLD YOU, HUH?

23:05.785 --> 23:08.758
THE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
IS HOW I KNEW IT WAS ROUGH.

23:08.758 --> 23:11.821
I WAS JUST REALLY ANGRY.

23:11.821 --> 23:13.693
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T REALIZE
THIS WHOLE THING

23:13.693 --> 23:14.994
IS KILLING ME, TOO.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.667
NO, BELIEVE ME, SHE DOES.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.630
THAT'S WHY SHE WON'T
STAY OUT OF IT.

23:20.630 --> 23:22.972
WELL, IT'S NOT MAKING IT
ANY EASIER ON ME.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.807
WHEN IT COMES TO HER KIDS,

23:27.807 --> 23:30.810
YOUR MOM HAS ONE GEAR,
JULIE--

23:30.810 --> 23:33.012
LOVE. THAT'S IT.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.885
AND IF YOU SORT THROUGH
ALL THE TIMES IN YOUR LIFE

23:35.885 --> 23:37.887
THAT SHE DROVE YOU NUTS,

23:37.887 --> 23:41.921
WHAT SHE DID, WHAT SHE SAID,
OR HOW SHE ACTED...

23:41.921 --> 23:43.893
YOU'RE GONNA FIND LOVE.

23:46.796 --> 23:48.658
I KNOW.

23:50.760 --> 23:55.665
AND... AS FAR AS FLAWS
IN A MOM GO...

23:55.665 --> 23:56.966
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

24:04.714 --> 24:06.946
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

24:06.946 --> 24:08.818
I KISSED HIM.
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

24:08.818 --> 24:10.850
WELL, SOME PEOPLE AT SCHOOL
THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE

24:10.850 --> 24:13.022
TO DO ON THE PLAYGROUND.

24:13.022 --> 24:16.986
OH. WELL, I KNOW A SPOT
AT THE PARK WHERE WE CAN KISS.

24:16.986 --> 24:19.889
NO, NO, NO,
NO KISSING RYAN ANYWHERE.

24:19.889 --> 24:21.991
BUT THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

24:21.991 --> 24:24.063
FIRST, KISSING,
THEN GET MARRIED,

24:24.063 --> 24:25.965
THEN HE BUYS ME PRESENTS.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.798
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER.

24:28.798 --> 24:31.971
(sighs) HONEY...

24:31.971 --> 24:35.945
UH, I DON'T THINK
RYAN LIKES YOU LIKE THAT.

24:35.945 --> 24:37.977
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE SENT ME A VALENTINE.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.982
ACTUALLY, HE DIDN'T.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.083
I DID.

24:46.786 --> 24:51.060
I SIGNED HIS NAME, AND I LET YOU
THINK IT WAS FROM HIM.

24:53.062 --> 24:54.924
IT'S JUST WHEN
YOU DIDN'T GET A VALENTINE,

24:54.924 --> 24:56.726
YOU SEEMED SO UPSET,

24:56.726 --> 24:58.998
AND I JUST WANTED
TO SEE YOU HAPPY AGAIN.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.033
(sighs) I'M SORRY, JUANITA.

25:04.033 --> 25:06.836
I HATE SEEING YOU
SAD LIKE THIS.

25:07.977 --> 25:10.740
I'M NOT SAD. I'M MAD.

25:10.740 --> 25:12.011
YOU ALWAYS LIE TO ME.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.043
I DON'T LIE TO YOU.

25:14.043 --> 25:18.017
OKAY, THEN, WHERE'S DADDY?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.049
'CAUSE I KNOW
HE'S NOT IN EUROPE.

25:21.891 --> 25:23.122
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

25:23.122 --> 25:26.055
I CAN TELL.
I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE.

25:26.055 --> 25:27.997
I KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE HIDING STUFF.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.002
(sighs) WELL...

25:33.002 --> 25:35.935
YOU'RE GROWING UP SO FAST.

25:38.107 --> 25:40.139
OH, HONEY, A PART OF ME
STILL SEES YOU

25:40.139 --> 25:44.073
AS THIS CUTE LITTLE BABY
I USED TO BATHE IN THE SINK.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.880
BUT EVERY DAY YOU'RE GETTING
STRONGER AND SMARTER.

25:52.121 --> 25:56.856
SO MAYBE I DON'T NEED
TO PROTECT YOU QUITE SO MUCH.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.991
WHY DON'T WE GET
SOME CUPCAKES?

26:01.991 --> 26:04.063
YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE
A LITTLE TALK.

26:12.001 --> 26:13.873
MOM...

26:13.873 --> 26:14.944
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:14.944 --> 26:17.106
DON'T WORRY.
I'M PUTTING THEM AWAY.

26:17.106 --> 26:18.948
(sighs)

26:18.948 --> 26:22.912
AW. REMEMBER THESE?

26:22.912 --> 26:25.054
NO, MOM, I WAS 1.

26:25.054 --> 26:28.187
I HAD A PAIR THAT MATCHED.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.159
PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS
LOOK AT US.

26:30.159 --> 26:33.893
BECAUSE YOU WERE A GROWN WOMAN
IN PINK STRIPED OVERALLS.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.065
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT WE WERE
A CHRISTIAN SINGING GROUP.

26:36.065 --> 26:41.200
THEY'D SAY
WE LOOKED SWEET TOGETHER.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.834
I WOULDN'T TRADE THAT MEMORY
FOR ANYTHING.

26:49.178 --> 26:53.112
I KNOW THIS IS HARD.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.915
AND I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR THE WAY I WENT OFF ON YOU.

26:55.915 --> 27:01.050
NO. I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

27:01.050 --> 27:05.024
I HAD NO RIGHT TO LIE
TO THOSE PEOPLE.

27:07.096 --> 27:11.961
AND I KNOW THAT I MADE MISTAKES
WITH YOU--A LOT OF THEM.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.865
(sighs)

27:15.865 --> 27:18.007
I GUESS I JUST TOLD MYSELF
IT WAS OKAY

27:18.007 --> 27:21.140
BECAUSE YOU TURNED OUT
SO GREAT.

27:24.073 --> 27:27.216
YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

27:27.216 --> 27:29.078
I KNOW THAT.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.922
YOU'RE A GREAT MOM.

27:39.028 --> 27:40.159
I'D DO IT AGAIN
IN A HEARTBEAT.

27:43.192 --> 27:48.968
BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW HARD IT WAS... (sighs)

27:48.968 --> 27:52.171
YOU'RE ALWAYS
THE BEST THING IN MY LIFE.

27:52.171 --> 27:59.208
MOM, I'VE GIVEN THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

28:02.051 --> 28:05.184
(voice breaking)
AND IT'S THE TOUGHEST DECISION

28:05.184 --> 28:07.186
I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.992
BUT I'VE MADE IT.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.266
I UNDERSTAND.

28:20.229 --> 28:24.133
(sniffles) I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

28:24.133 --> 28:27.006
"HER"?

28:29.108 --> 28:31.080
IT'S A GIRL.

28:38.788 --> 28:41.791
(doorbell rings)

28:41.791 --> 28:43.122
HEY, YOU.

28:43.122 --> 28:46.826
SORRY I'M LATE.
STUPID TRAFFIC.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.898
WE SHOULD GET A MOVE ON IF WE'RE
GONNA MAKE OUR RESERVATIONS.

28:48.898 --> 28:51.060
NO. NO, NO, WE HAVE TIME.
COME ON IN.

28:51.060 --> 28:55.004
SO CAN I, UM,
GET YOU ANYTHING BEFORE WE GO?

28:55.004 --> 28:58.968
COFFEE OR A DRINK OR...

28:58.968 --> 29:00.109
DESSERT?

29:00.109 --> 29:03.012
DESSERT?
WE HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

29:03.012 --> 29:06.876
I KNOW. I'M TALKING
ABOUT... DESSERT.

29:06.876 --> 29:09.018
I'M NOT FALLING
FOR THIS AGAIN.

29:09.018 --> 29:10.820
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT--

29:10.820 --> 29:13.923
SEX. I'M TALKING ABOUT SEX.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SEX?

29:13.923 --> 29:16.025
NOW?
 MM.

29:16.025 --> 29:17.887
YOU SAID THE KIDS ARE
AT YOUR EX'S ALL NIGHT.

29:17.887 --> 29:19.088
WE COULD STILL GO TO DINNER.

29:19.088 --> 29:20.830
NO, NO, NO, NO, 'CAUSE THEN

29:20.830 --> 29:21.861
IT'LL BE HANGING
OVER OUR HEADS ALL NIGHT,

29:21.861 --> 29:22.932
AND I'LL BE DRINKING
TOO MUCH

29:22.932 --> 29:24.994
AND LAUGHING TOO HARD
AT YOUR JOKES,

29:24.994 --> 29:26.896
AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE REASONS,

29:26.896 --> 29:28.868
SO COULD WE PLEASE
JUST GO HAVE SEX?

29:33.873 --> 29:36.846
(gasps)

29:36.846 --> 29:37.877
MMM.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.008
(both moaning)

29:39.008 --> 29:40.149
(click)

29:40.149 --> 29:41.881
(both chuckle)

29:41.881 --> 29:43.983
I WAS KINDA HOPING THAT
WE COULD LEAVE THAT ON.

29:43.983 --> 29:47.016
FIVE KIDS. TRUST ME.
IT'S BETTER OFF.

29:47.016 --> 29:48.017
OH, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

29:48.017 --> 29:50.059
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

29:50.059 --> 29:52.892
(switch clicks)

29:52.892 --> 29:54.223
TELL YOU WHAT.

29:54.223 --> 29:57.196
(switch clicks)
 I TURN THE BEDSIDE LAMP ON,

29:57.196 --> 29:59.198
AND YOU GET THE CANDLES.

29:59.198 --> 30:04.203
HOW ABOUT...
I'LL SEE YOUR BEDSIDE LAMP...

30:04.203 --> 30:06.876
AND I'LL RAISE YOU..
A FLOOR LAMP?
 (click)

30:06.876 --> 30:08.878
UNH-UNH. FLOOR LAMP'S OUT.

30:08.878 --> 30:11.941
(click)
 I'M NOT GOING OVER 25 WATTS.

30:11.941 --> 30:13.983
UH, HOW ABOUT...

30:13.983 --> 30:16.085
CLOSET LIGHT ON...
 (click)

30:16.085 --> 30:19.989
AND I'LL CRACK THE DOOR, AND...

30:21.090 --> 30:24.223
YOU...

30:24.223 --> 30:26.195
GET TO KEEP THE CANDLES?

30:27.927 --> 30:31.901
SORRY. THAT'S AS HIGH
AS I CAN GO THIS ROUND.

30:36.065 --> 30:37.136
THEN I'M ALL IN.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.908
OH!

30:38.908 --> 30:41.110
LYNETTE?

30:41.110 --> 30:43.272
SWEETHEART?

30:43.272 --> 30:45.174
WHAT IS GOING ON?

30:45.174 --> 30:47.046
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR MESSAGE.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.247
(grunts)

30:48.247 --> 30:50.249
(sighs) THAT'S WHAT YOU LEFT
ON MY MACHINE.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.252
CAN YOU USE YOUR WORDS,
PLEASE?
 (grunts)

30:53.252 --> 30:57.126
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR DATE
WITH FRANK LAST NIGHT?

30:57.126 --> 30:59.258
GRUNT ONCE FOR A "YES,"
TWICE FOR "NO."

30:59.258 --> 31:00.960
(grunts)

31:00.960 --> 31:02.191
DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH HIM?

31:02.191 --> 31:05.064
SORT OF.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.066
SORT OF? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

31:07.066 --> 31:09.238
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT.

31:09.238 --> 31:11.971
(sighs) THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

31:11.971 --> 31:15.304
YOU CALLED ME OVER.
NOW TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.979
(sighs) I CRIED.

31:19.979 --> 31:23.212
OH, NO. WHEN? AFTER?

31:23.212 --> 31:25.184
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

31:25.184 --> 31:29.318
(sighs) GOD. IS THERE
ANY WAY HE DIDN'T NOTICE?

31:29.318 --> 31:33.222
I BLEW MY NOSE
IN THE SHEETS.

31:33.222 --> 31:35.024
KINDA HARD TO IGNORE.

31:35.024 --> 31:37.967
WHAT MADE YOU CRY?

31:37.967 --> 31:42.071
I OPENED MY EYES,
AND--AND I SAW HIM--

31:42.071 --> 31:44.203
THIS LOVELY MAN I HAVE
A REALLY NICE TIME WITH--

31:44.203 --> 31:46.175
AND I REALIZED...

31:46.175 --> 31:48.237
MY MARRIAGE IS OVER.

31:48.237 --> 31:49.308
NOW DIDN'T YOU REALIZE THAT

31:49.308 --> 31:51.310
WHEN TOM TOOK HIS GIRLFRIEND
TO EUROPE?

31:51.310 --> 31:53.983
NO, I DIDN'T,

31:53.983 --> 31:57.346
BECAUSE THAT WAS TOM,
AND I KEPT THINKING,

31:57.346 --> 32:02.121
"BOY, TOM'S MOVING ON,"
BUT THIS IS ME.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.254
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING
TO ME.

32:07.096 --> 32:09.028
(sighs)

32:09.028 --> 32:13.032
(sighs)

32:13.032 --> 32:16.065
LOVE BITES, DOESN'T IT?

32:16.065 --> 32:19.068
WHAT DID, UH, FRANK DO?

32:19.068 --> 32:20.209
HE WAS REALLY SWEET.

32:20.209 --> 32:24.173
HANDED ME A BOX OF KLEENEX,
SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

32:24.173 --> 32:27.346
BUT TRUST ME,
I'M NEVER SEEING HIM AGAIN.

32:27.346 --> 32:31.080
WELL, THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

32:31.080 --> 32:34.123
IT COST YOU ONE GUY
TO FACE THE TRUTH.

32:34.123 --> 32:36.385
YOUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.

32:36.385 --> 32:39.088
NOW YOU CAN MOVE ON
JUST LIKE TOM.

32:39.088 --> 32:43.032
YIPPEE FOR ME.

32:43.032 --> 32:44.363
MM-HMM.

32:44.363 --> 32:47.096
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE SAME THING I TOLD BREE

32:47.096 --> 32:48.237
WHEN I TOOK HER OUT DRINKING.

32:48.237 --> 32:53.142
THE ONLY WAY TO LIVE LIFE
IS WILDLY.

32:55.244 --> 32:56.275
WHAT?

32:56.275 --> 32:58.307
YOU TOOK BREE OUT DRINKING?

32:58.307 --> 33:00.379
YEAH. WHY?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.081
IS THAT BAD?

33:02.081 --> 33:04.053
HOW THE HELL COULD RENEE
TAKE HER OUT DRINKING?!

33:04.053 --> 33:06.255
DOESN'T SHE KNOW
BREE'S AN ALCOHOLIC?

33:06.255 --> 33:08.057
I HAVE KNOWN RENEE
A LONG TIME,

33:08.057 --> 33:11.090
AND SHE'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'D CALL A DETAIL PERSON.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.122
WELL... (sighs)
AT LEAST THIS HELPS EXPLAIN

33:13.122 --> 33:15.094
THE WAY
BREE'S BEEN ACTING LATELY.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.126
I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH BOOZE IN THE WORLD

33:17.126 --> 33:19.398
TO JUSTIFY THE SKEEZES
COMING OUT OF THAT HOUSE.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.300
HOW COULD WE NOT KNOW THIS?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.102
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
SPEAKING TO HER,

33:23.102 --> 33:24.433
YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE OF WHAT SHE DID.

33:24.433 --> 33:27.236
I WAS SO MAD. I THOUGHT
I'D STAY MAD A LONG TIME,

33:27.236 --> 33:29.378
BUT NOW,
KNOWING THAT SHE'S HURTING...

33:29.378 --> 33:31.140
IT JUST SEEMS MEAN.

33:31.140 --> 33:33.112
YEAH.

33:33.112 --> 33:36.385
I MISS HER.
I MISS US BEING US.

33:36.385 --> 33:39.218
SO WHATEVER HAPPENED,
WE NEED TO PUT IT BEHIND US

33:39.218 --> 33:40.349
AND GO HELP BREE.

33:42.091 --> 33:43.352
DO YOU THINK WE CAN
GET THROUGH TO HER?

33:43.352 --> 33:46.295
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE HAVE TO TRY.

33:46.295 --> 33:49.128
(moaning and kissing)

33:49.128 --> 33:50.229
(chuckles)

33:50.229 --> 33:54.333
(both continue moaning)

33:54.333 --> 33:58.467
UH, YOU SURE
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE?

34:01.170 --> 34:03.242
WHAT THE HELL?

34:03.242 --> 34:06.445
WOW. BOOZE, LOOSE MORALS,
AND NOW SWEARING?

34:06.445 --> 34:08.177
TOO LATE.
THERE'S NO BREE LEFT.

34:08.177 --> 34:09.447
WHY ARE YOU IN MY HOUSE?

34:09.447 --> 34:12.121
THIS IS AN INTERVENTION,
BREE.

34:12.121 --> 34:14.382
THIS ISN'T FOR TV, IS IT?
'CAUSE I'M MARRIED.

34:14.382 --> 34:16.125
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.357
AN INTERVENTION?
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.389
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
WE WANNA HELP.

34:20.389 --> 34:22.391
GET OUT! ALL OF YOU!

34:22.391 --> 34:25.333
(door opens)
 NOT YOU.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.435
(door closes)

34:26.435 --> 34:28.167
(under breath) IDIOT.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.399
TALK TO US, SWEETIE.
WHY ARE YOU BEHAVING LIKE THIS?

34:30.399 --> 34:32.271
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.402
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

34:34.402 --> 34:37.406
WE KNOW YOU'RE DRINKING AGAIN.
 (gasps)

34:37.406 --> 34:39.408
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL THESE MEN?
WE KNOW ABOUT THAT, TOO.

34:39.408 --> 34:43.452
WOW, CAN'T HIDE ANYTHING
FROM YOU GIRLS, HUH?

34:45.184 --> 34:48.516
AND DID YOU ALSO KNOW
I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF?

34:48.516 --> 34:50.319
WHAT?

34:50.319 --> 34:51.489
OH, MY GOD.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.422
HOW'D THAT LITTLE NUGGET
OF INFORMATION

34:53.422 --> 34:57.296
SLIP PAST MY NEAREST
AND DEAREST FRIENDS?

34:57.296 --> 35:00.199
IF THIS IS A JOKE,
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.401
IT'S NOT A JOKE.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.433
I CHECKED INTO A MOTEL ROOM

35:04.433 --> 35:08.177
WITH NOTHING BUT A BOTTLE
AND A GUN.

35:08.177 --> 35:10.479
AND YOU'RE WRONG, SUSAN.
IT IS FUNNY--

35:10.479 --> 35:16.385
FUNNY THAT THE WOMEN
STANDING HERE BEFORE ME...

35:16.385 --> 35:21.190
(scoffs) PROFESSING TO BE
MY SUPPORTIVE FRIENDS...

35:21.190 --> 35:24.423
ARE THE REASON THAT
I WAS IN THAT MOTEL ROOM.
 BREE, STOP.

35:24.423 --> 35:27.196
NO! DON'T GIVE ME
THIS "FRIENDS" NONSENSE.

35:27.196 --> 35:29.498
ALL I EVER WAS TO YOU
WAS THE ORGANIZER,

35:29.498 --> 35:31.400
THE PROBLEM SOLVER,

35:31.400 --> 35:33.502
A LEADER
WHEN YOU NEEDED ONE,

35:33.502 --> 35:39.208
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
THAT HORRIBLE NIGHT

35:39.208 --> 35:41.340
WHEN WE BURIED YOUR STEPFATHER.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.472
AND I WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

35:43.472 --> 35:46.545
LIAR! ALL OF YOU, LIARS!

35:46.545 --> 35:48.547
BECAUSE AS SOON
AS IT GOT ROUGH,

35:48.547 --> 35:52.221
AS SOON AS THERE WAS
ANY TROUBLE,

35:52.221 --> 35:53.522
IT ALL BECAME MY FAULT,

35:53.522 --> 35:55.424
AND OFF YOU WENT.

35:55.424 --> 35:57.586
WE HAD NO IDEA.
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD US.

35:57.586 --> 35:59.328
OH, I TRIED.

35:59.328 --> 36:02.231
BUT EVEN WHEN I CAME
TO YOU TO APOLOGIZE,

36:02.231 --> 36:05.434
YOU SLAMMED YOUR DOORS
IN MY FACE!

36:07.296 --> 36:09.298
OKAY, FINE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:09.298 --> 36:12.401
WE DID. WE SCREWED UP.
WE LET THIS PULL US APART,

36:12.401 --> 36:14.273
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
AGAIN.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.575
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT
YOU THINK,

36:16.575 --> 36:19.348
WE LOVE YOU, BREE.
 WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

36:19.348 --> 36:21.610
WE JUST WANT THINGS TO BE BACK
THE WAY THEY WERE.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.257
WELL, I DON'T.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.328
FRANK.

36:39.328 --> 36:40.499
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

36:40.499 --> 36:44.303
WELL, THIS I SOMETHING
I RECENTLY DISCOVERED

36:44.303 --> 36:45.574
CALLED PIZZA.

36:45.574 --> 36:47.476
I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

36:47.476 --> 36:50.609
I'M SORRY.
DID WE HAVE PLANS?

36:50.609 --> 36:54.443
NOPE. THIS IS MORE
OF A STEALTH DATE.

36:54.443 --> 36:56.645
EVERY TIME WE MADE PLANS,
THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

36:56.645 --> 36:59.318
SO I FIGURED,
MAYBE THINGS WOULD BE BETTER

36:59.318 --> 37:00.589
IF WE SNEAK UP
ON EACH OTHER.

37:00.589 --> 37:03.622
DO YOU HAVE SOME UNRESOLVED
MOTHER ISSUES OR SOMETHING?

37:03.622 --> 37:07.426
WELL, ACTUALLY, MY MOTHER
AND I GET ALONG QUITE WELL.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.557
WHY DO YOU ASK?

37:08.557 --> 37:10.529
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I CAN THINK OF

37:10.529 --> 37:12.631
OF WHY YOU WOULD
KEEP COMING BACK HERE.

37:12.631 --> 37:16.365
OH, I CAN THINK OF ANOTHER.
I LIKE YOU.

37:16.365 --> 37:20.369
YOU DO REMEMBER I CRIED
IN THE MIDDLE OF SEX, RIGHT?

37:20.369 --> 37:25.614
LYNETTE, YOU LIVED
WITH THE SAME GUY FOR 20 YEARS.

37:25.614 --> 37:27.516
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
THAT HE'D BE IN YOUR HEAD.

37:27.516 --> 37:29.618
AND FRANKLY, I'D THINK TWICE
ABOUT YOU IF HE WEREN'T.

37:29.618 --> 37:31.620
(dishes clatter)

37:31.620 --> 37:33.622
IS IT WEIRD TO SAY "FRANKLY"
WHEN YOUR NAME IS FRANK?

37:33.622 --> 37:35.484
NOT UNTIL NOW.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.628
LOOK, I'M A GUY.

37:39.628 --> 37:42.431
SO OBVIOUSLY,
I'M A COMPLETE IDIOT.

37:42.431 --> 37:44.433
BUT THE ONE THING I DO KNOW

37:44.433 --> 37:46.595
IS THAT IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO MEET SOMEONE

37:46.595 --> 37:50.599
WHO'S SEXY, SMART, AND FUNNY,
AND WHO ACTUALLY LIKES YOU,

37:50.599 --> 37:52.601
YOU GIVE THAT PERSON
ALL THE TIME THEY NEED.

37:55.644 --> 37:57.646
NOW WHERE'S YOUR CORKSCREW?

38:00.409 --> 38:03.752
UH, MIDDLE DRAWER
ON THE RIGHT.

38:07.716 --> 38:09.658
HEY, HEY.

38:09.658 --> 38:11.720
MMM.

38:11.720 --> 38:16.425
MMM. MMM, MMM, MNH-MNH.
WAIT.

38:16.425 --> 38:18.767
I KNOW YOU'RE MORE
COMFORTABLE LIKE THIS.

38:18.767 --> 38:19.768
(click)

38:19.768 --> 38:23.502
(sighs) LEAVE IT ON.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.404
(switch clicks)

38:30.679 --> 38:32.641
EVENING, BREE.

38:32.641 --> 38:33.782
THE USUAL?

38:33.782 --> 38:37.586
I SUPPOSE IT HAS BECOME
"THE USUAL," HASN'T IT?

38:38.787 --> 38:41.490
YES, PLEASE.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.594
HEY.

38:48.657 --> 38:51.530
YOU KNOW, I GOT A THING
FOR REDHEADS.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.632
WANNA SEE IT?

38:53.632 --> 38:56.465
CHARMING.
 (chuckles)

38:56.465 --> 38:57.636
IT'S BREE, RIGHT?

38:57.636 --> 38:59.768
LISTEN, I JUST CAME HERE
TO HAVE A DRINK.

38:59.768 --> 39:01.740
I REALLY DON'T FEEL
LIKE TALKING.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.443
YEAH?

39:04.443 --> 39:07.446
WELL... IT WASN'T THE CHANCE
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

39:07.446 --> 39:08.647
THAT BROUGHT ME OVER.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.719
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

39:10.719 --> 39:12.821
I KNOW WHAT YOU COME HERE FOR.
WE CAN STOP THE GAME.

39:12.821 --> 39:14.453
WE CAN STOP EVERYTHING,

39:14.453 --> 39:15.824
INCLUDING THIS
UNFORTUNATE ENCOUNTER.

39:17.726 --> 39:18.727
NOW PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE.

39:18.727 --> 39:22.461
(laughs) WAIT.

39:22.461 --> 39:28.567
WAIT, WAIT. SO... SO SUDDENLY
YOU'RE SOME HIGH-CLASS LADY?

39:28.567 --> 39:32.671
HMM? GIVE ME A BREAK.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.674
EVERYBODY IN THIS BAR
KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE.

39:37.806 --> 39:39.848
(bartender) YOU WANT ME
TO START A TAB FOR YOU?

39:47.716 --> 39:49.788
NO.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.820
NO, I DON'T. I HAVE TO GO.
 (sets down bill)

39:51.820 --> 39:53.792
(scoffs)

39:58.597 --> 39:59.628
(keys jangle)

39:59.628 --> 40:00.669
I'LL DRIVE.

40:03.632 --> 40:04.733
PLEASE GIVE ME MY KEYS.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.835
COME ON, BREE.
I SEE SOME OF THE DIRTBAGS

40:06.835 --> 40:09.838
YOU DRAG OUT OF THIS PLACE.
WHAT? I DON'T MAKE THE CUT?

40:09.838 --> 40:11.740
NO, YOU'RE VILE.

40:11.740 --> 40:14.713
NOW GIVE ME MY KEYS
AND GET AWAY FROM ME.

40:14.713 --> 40:17.886
WHOA. THIS IS
A NEW LOW FOR ME.

40:17.886 --> 40:19.818
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE TOWN PUMP.

40:21.890 --> 40:25.524
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:25.524 --> 40:27.626
I THINK WE'LL TAKE MY CAR.
 AAH!

40:27.626 --> 40:30.559
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH YOU!

40:30.559 --> 40:31.860
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!

40:31.860 --> 40:34.763
YOU LIKE A FIGHT, HUH?
I CAN PLAY ROUGH.
 AAH!

40:34.763 --> 40:36.535
(grunting) LET GO OF ME.
LET GO!

40:36.535 --> 40:38.537
YOU HEARD HER.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.810
LET GO.

40:41.810 --> 40:43.542
ORSON!

40:43.542 --> 40:46.575
HELLO, BREE.
WE'LL CATCH UP IN A MOMENT.

40:46.575 --> 40:47.846
IF YOU'RE SMART,

40:47.846 --> 40:49.748
YOU'LL STEP AWAY FROM HER

40:49.748 --> 40:52.551
AND GO BACK TO THE HOLE
YOU CRAWLED OUT OF.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.783
BUDDY, I GOT A RULE ABOUT
NOT HITTING GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS,

40:54.783 --> 40:56.885
BUT YOU--YOU'RE BEGGING
FOR AN ASTERISK.

40:59.828 --> 41:03.562
(crackling)
 (screaming)

41:04.933 --> 41:07.866
(screaming and grunting)
TURN IT OFF!

41:07.866 --> 41:09.698
(crackling stops, clatter)

41:12.571 --> 41:14.803
I ALSO HAVE PEPPER SPRAY.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.750
ORSON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HOW DID YOU--
 YOUR FRIENDS CALLED ME.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.654
THEY SAID YOU WERE
GOING THROUGH A ROUGH TIME.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.594
ORSON, I'VE MADE
SUCH A MESS OF MY LIFE.

41:36.925 --> 41:38.727
DON'T WORRY, DEAR.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.801
THE ONE THING YOU AND I
WERE ALWAYS GOOD AT

41:42.801 --> 41:44.833
WAS CLEANING THINGS UP.

41:48.607 --> 41:49.878
(breathing heavily)

41:49.878 --> 41:55.844
YES, LOVE CAN BRING OUT
THE BEST IN US...

41:58.687 --> 42:00.919
THE CONFIDENCE TO MOVE ON...

42:04.923 --> 42:07.996
THE COURAGE
TO TELL THE TRUTH...

42:11.700 --> 42:14.763
THE STRENGTH TO KEEP HOPING...

42:15.764 --> 42:16.865
(sighs)

42:18.637 --> 42:22.711
BUT SOMETIMES
WHAT SURPRISES US MOST

42:22.711 --> 42:25.874
ISN'T WHAT LOVE BRINGS OUT...

42:25.874 --> 42:29.978
BUT WHO IT BRINGS BACK.
