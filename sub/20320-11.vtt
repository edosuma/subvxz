Oh, come on!

00:20.832 --> 00:23.268
(Oz groaning in frustration)

00:23.335 --> 00:25.236
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:25.304 --> 00:27.539
What's going on?
What happened?

00:27.606 --> 00:30.375
Does the five-second rule
apply to canned goods?

00:30.442 --> 00:33.210
No. Come on, are you
kidding me? Seriously.

00:33.278 --> 00:35.517
- What, are you hitting the heavy bag again?
- Yeah.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.790
You know, Olivia would hate to see you
punishing yourself like this.

00:37.861 --> 00:39.994
It helps me clear my mind.

00:40.285 --> 00:42.186
What's going on with you?
You look winded.

00:42.253 --> 00:44.454
Yeah, well, I just had
to jog half a dozen blocks

00:44.522 --> 00:46.590
trying to keep this frozen
yoghurt from melting, so...

00:46.658 --> 00:49.292
- Uh-huh.
- Phew! Really feeling the burn right now.

00:49.359 --> 00:51.160
Let me guess: the car's
acting up again, huh?

00:51.228 --> 00:54.664
Acting up? No, this was complete
vehicular betrayal, my friend.

00:54.731 --> 00:57.966
I gave the Red Thunder the best two
years of my life, plus a kick-ass name,

00:58.034 --> 01:00.303
and how does it pay me back?
By cacking out

01:00.370 --> 01:02.405
two blocks outside
the Fresh Co parking lot!

01:02.472 --> 01:05.373
How's your new case going, by the way?
You making any progress?

01:05.441 --> 01:09.611
Yeah, you know, 15 break-ins, one woman's
dead, three other guys were beaten.

01:09.679 --> 01:11.613
You know, we're still
at square one. You all right?

01:11.681 --> 01:13.648
Yeah. I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

01:13.716 --> 01:16.218
Yeah, well, we better soon.
The whole city's freaking out.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.286
Ohhhh!

01:18.354 --> 01:20.622
Forget the fro-yo.
it's just "yo" now.

01:20.690 --> 01:23.591
- No, no, no. This is the best.
- Really?

01:23.658 --> 01:26.694
Put it in the microwave.
Come on. I'll get a spoon.

01:26.761 --> 01:28.795
- We can save this.
- That's disgusting.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.000
(glass shattering)

01:59.092 --> 02:01.593
Pete? Diane?

02:08.300 --> 02:09.868

<i>- Hey!</i>

02:11.971 --> 02:14.338
(grunting with effort)

02:14.406 --> 02:16.875
Ugh! Oh!

02:19.078 --> 02:20.245
Oh!

02:27.585 --> 02:31.354
(small explosion)
- Ah! - Oh!

02:34.592 --> 02:36.493
Ah!

02:36.560 --> 02:39.362
Well, let's get
the hell out of here!

03:10.270 --> 03:12.271
- You OK?
- Yeah.

03:12.338 --> 03:14.739
I keep expecting Olivia
to walk around the corner.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.942
Everything about this place
reminds me of her.

03:17.010 --> 03:19.043
Yeah. I felt the same way
when my dad passed away.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.045
Couldn't walk through a precinct
without hearing his voice

03:21.113 --> 03:23.414
in my head. Hey.

03:23.481 --> 03:26.184
Oh, hey. I figured
I'd be seeing you guys here.

03:26.251 --> 03:28.052
- How's he doing?
- Daniel Norton,

03:28.120 --> 03:31.422
age 43: multiple contusions, bruised
kidney, and a grade- three concussion,

03:31.489 --> 03:33.590
So, in short,
he's messed up pretty good.

03:33.658 --> 03:36.092
- Can we see him?
- He's awake, but, uh,

03:36.160 --> 03:39.029
I don't know how cognitive
he'll be. Yeah, brain injuries

03:39.096 --> 03:41.564
are tricky things.
You know what? I'll take you.

03:44.001 --> 03:47.137
Mr. Norton,
I'm Sergeant McCluskey.

03:47.205 --> 03:49.172
This is Toby Logan.
We're with the IIB.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.140
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

03:51.208 --> 03:53.275
- about last night's attack.
- I don't remember much.

03:53.343 --> 03:56.145
We understand.
Anything you can give us

03:56.213 --> 03:58.280
- would help.
- I'll do my best.

03:58.348 --> 04:00.749
- Five minutes. That's it.
- Yeah.

04:00.817 --> 04:02.985
Did you get a look
at your assailants?

04:03.053 --> 04:05.420
It was dark.
It happened so fast.

04:05.488 --> 04:07.555
It's OK. Take your time.

04:07.622 --> 04:11.025
Two guys wearing
black ski masks.

04:11.093 --> 04:13.161
We struggled...

04:13.229 --> 04:16.428
I grabbed at one of their masks.
Saw his face.

04:19.334 --> 04:22.669
- Ooh!
- Would you be able to give us a description?

04:22.737 --> 04:25.272
He was white.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.107
I don't...

04:27.175 --> 04:29.576
I'm sorry, I-I didn't
get a good look.

04:29.643 --> 04:33.913
OK. Is there anything else
you can recall?

04:33.981 --> 04:38.617
Blinding flash of light,
and then... I don't...

04:38.685 --> 04:40.619
Can't...

04:43.590 --> 04:45.391
Was there someone else there?

04:49.061 --> 04:53.699
I thought maybe
I saw... but...

04:53.767 --> 04:55.967
OK. Get some rest.

04:56.035 --> 04:58.771
Thank you for your time.

05:03.842 --> 05:06.711
OK, when you say "costume",
you mean like, uh, Spiderman?

05:06.779 --> 05:08.479
More like Batman--

05:08.547 --> 05:10.882
dark, hiding
in the shadows.

05:10.949 --> 05:12.950
- You sure he was really there?
- I don't know.

05:13.018 --> 05:15.019
If he thinks he saw it,
then I saw it.

05:15.086 --> 05:17.154
Well, Norton suffered serious
head trauma, which makes him

05:17.222 --> 05:19.356
an unreliable witness,
so for now let's just focus

05:19.424 --> 05:22.392
- on the crime itself.
- OK, well, once again,

05:22.460 --> 05:24.895
the target house was in a quiet,
white-collar neighbourhood.

05:24.962 --> 05:28.331
Right. And the two perps fit the
description given to us by the previous

05:28.399 --> 05:31.668
witnesses, which supports the theory
that this is the work of the same crew.

05:31.736 --> 05:34.805
- These attacks are escalating.
- It's also consistent with the pattern.

05:34.872 --> 05:37.205
It's only a matter of time
before they kill again.

05:37.273 --> 05:40.142
All the more reason
to figure this out quickly.

05:40.209 --> 05:44.246
I just spent the last 20 minutes getting torn
a new one by our favourite superintendent,

05:44.314 --> 05:48.183
- so, please, give me a suspect, a solid lead, anything.
- Well, we're still

05:48.251 --> 05:50.152
waiting for the lab to process
evidence gathered

05:50.219 --> 05:52.086
at the scene, but if it's
anything like the others,

05:52.154 --> 05:54.689
- we shouldn't hold our breath.
- What about your read

05:54.757 --> 05:57.191
of the victim? You said he got
a look at one of his attackers?

05:57.259 --> 06:01.429
- Yeah. I did. Just a glimpse.
- Well, a face doesn't help much unless we can put a name to it.

06:01.497 --> 06:04.298
Well, if he's got a record, he'll be
in the database. I can get Toby set up

06:04.366 --> 06:06.300
- with the identi-kit.
- Yeah, do that.

06:06.368 --> 06:08.335
And then check with the pawn
shops. See if there's

06:08.402 --> 06:10.838
any recent inventory
that's linked to our robberies.

06:15.944 --> 06:17.878
I feel like we're
missing something.

06:17.946 --> 06:20.881
I want you to go over the case
files of each crime scene again.

06:20.949 --> 06:24.149
Talk to the homeowners, look for
patterns, hidden commonalities.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.252
Our best hope of catching these guys is figuring
out where they're going to strike next.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.221
Well, that's easier said
than done. Everything points

06:29.289 --> 06:31.256
to these houses
being chosen at random.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.226
Yeah, I don't buy that.
These crimes are connected.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.828
Let's figure out how.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.301
Hey. Gift from the lab boys.
It's a hollow copper

06:43.369 --> 06:45.770
tube filled with traces
of flash powder inside.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.306
Came back clean
for fingerprints.

06:48.374 --> 06:51.776
Mm. So that could be the blinding flashing
light Daniel Norton was talking about.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.679
Could be. It's homemade but well crafted.
Whoever made it knows what they're doing.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.014
You see? There was
someone else there.

06:57.081 --> 06:59.116
Looks that way.
How's it going here?

06:59.183 --> 07:01.704
No luck matching the face
on your read of Daniel?

07:01.798 --> 07:04.243
After three hours of this,
they all look the same.

07:04.337 --> 07:06.356
Well, why don't you go home
and get some rest? I'll give you

07:06.424 --> 07:07.992
a call if something else
comes up.

07:08.059 --> 07:09.593
OK.

07:21.271 --> 07:23.272
(phone ringing)

07:23.340 --> 07:26.676
(woman sighs) Yeah, I know I missed
deadline, but I have a new angle

07:26.744 --> 07:29.144
for the piece, so just keep your
pants on for 10 minutes, OK?

07:29.211 --> 07:30.879
<i>Tia, it's Toby Logan.</i>

07:30.947 --> 07:33.248
- Toby, hey!
<i>- Hey.</i>

07:33.315 --> 07:35.417
So sorry. I thought
you were my editor.

07:35.484 --> 07:37.986
Uh, if you're busy right now,
I can call you back later.

07:38.054 --> 07:40.355
No, no, it's fine. It's fine.
It's nice to hear from you.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.891
Are you, uh, still working
the home invasion murder?

07:42.959 --> 07:45.893
- Yeah.
<i>- Mm. Jealous. I wanted that story so bad,</i>

07:45.961 --> 07:49.396
<i>but it went to my senior crime reporter.
Let me guess: you</i>

07:49.464 --> 07:52.499
had a break in the case, and you're
insisting on giving me the exclusive?

07:52.568 --> 07:55.803
Not exactly. Actually, I was hoping
you could help me with something.

07:55.871 --> 08:00.307
- Related to the investigation?
<i>- Possibly, yes.</i>

08:00.375 --> 08:02.008
OK, shoot.

08:02.077 --> 08:04.478
This might sound weird,
but have you guys gotten

08:04.546 --> 08:07.281
any reports of a guy
walking the shadows,

08:07.348 --> 08:09.683
wearing a mask and costume?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.619
<i>- Anything like that?</i>
<i>- Actually, it's funny you should ask. We've had</i>

08:12.687 --> 08:15.355
a few calls to the hotline, but
I assumed that they were pranks.

08:15.423 --> 08:17.290
Well, they probably are.
Do you mind sending me

08:17.357 --> 08:19.625
the locations of those sightings
just in case?

08:19.693 --> 08:23.495
Well, I will send you the call
transcripts on one condition.

08:23.660 --> 08:24.800
What's that?

08:24.839 --> 08:27.100
If this leads to something,
I want first crack at it.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.202
Keep me in the loop
as much as you're allowed.

08:29.269 --> 08:32.104
Uh, you know
I can't promise anything.

08:32.171 --> 08:34.739
OK, I'll take that
as a yes. Thanks.

08:40.313 --> 08:42.179
You sure your partner's OK
with this?

08:42.248 --> 08:45.617
What, James? Yeah, he's fine
back there. He's got a book.

08:45.684 --> 08:48.086
- Turn right up here.
- By the way,

08:48.153 --> 08:50.354
driving around looking
for a rogue superhero,

08:50.422 --> 08:52.823
you officially have
the coolest job in the world.

08:52.890 --> 08:55.493
Well, he's not a superhero.
You know, it's not like

08:55.560 --> 08:57.495
he has powers or anything.
He's just a dude.

08:57.562 --> 08:59.696
You don't know that.
You have powers.

08:59.764 --> 09:02.466
You're a unitard away from being in the Justice
League. Batman never had any powers,

09:02.534 --> 09:05.768
and he's widely considered to be the
greatest superhero that ever lived.

09:05.836 --> 09:10.206
- He never lived. He was a comic book character.
- He's alive in here, Toby.

09:10.274 --> 09:13.143
I might be wasting
your time here anyway.

09:13.210 --> 09:16.279
I mean, what are the odds that this guy's going
to be in the right place at the right time

09:16.347 --> 09:18.248
- for us to spot him?
- What if I told you

09:18.315 --> 09:20.215
there was a way to drastically
improve your odds?

09:20.283 --> 09:22.618
- How's that?
- Check this out.

09:22.685 --> 09:25.454
This is Uni-21
calling all units.

09:25.522 --> 09:27.989
We are on the lookout
for a rogue vigilante

09:28.057 --> 09:30.492
dressed like a superhero. Over.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.562
<i>- This is Baker-12.</i>
<i>- Are you loaded, dude?</i>

09:33.621 --> 09:36.416
Just keep one eye on the road
and another in the shadows.

09:36.456 --> 09:37.472
<i>Whatever.</i>

09:37.502 --> 09:41.129
<i>- Count us in.</i>
<i>- Uni-21, this is Alpha-19. Yeah, we're in too.</i>

09:41.566 --> 09:43.604
<i>- All right?</i>
<i>- Nice.</i>

09:48.243 --> 09:50.044
We have something.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.379
My three favourite words
in the English language.

09:52.446 --> 09:54.648
So, I couldn't figure out
why they were breaking

09:54.715 --> 09:57.217
into some houses
while the homeowners were away

09:57.285 --> 09:59.319
and some while they were home.
I just chalked it up

09:59.387 --> 10:02.622
- to the random nature of the crimes.
- OK.

10:02.690 --> 10:04.591
Turns out there is
a common thread after all:

10:04.659 --> 10:07.126
all of the owners were
supposed to be away

10:07.195 --> 10:09.761
at the time
the incidents occurred.

10:09.829 --> 10:12.964
Tara Simms, she was booked on a flight to Mexico.
She was turned away

10:13.032 --> 10:15.634
at customs because
her passport was expired.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.804
You're saying she was murdered because
her vacation plans fell through.

10:18.871 --> 10:21.840
Yes. All the houses were
supposed to be empty.

10:21.908 --> 10:26.143
So I was right. It wasn't random after all.
These houses are being targeted.

10:26.212 --> 10:29.747
Yeah, and whoever is responsible is keeping
tabs on the homeowners' activities.

10:29.815 --> 10:32.684
They're being targeted
for what exactly?

10:32.751 --> 10:35.453
Each victim provided
an inventory of stolen items.

10:35.521 --> 10:38.956
There is nothing of significant
value taken from any of them.

10:39.024 --> 10:41.225
So what is it
they're after?

10:46.231 --> 10:48.665
Alpha-19, you still with us?

10:48.733 --> 10:51.968
<i>This is Alpha-19. Sorry for the radio silence.
We had to make a pit stop to gas up.</i>

10:52.036 --> 10:55.272
<i>- We're back on our route.</i>
<i>- Pit stops are a part of life.</i>

10:55.340 --> 10:57.506
- Thanks very much.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

10:57.574 --> 10:59.542
Sorry we couldn't be
more help for you.

10:59.610 --> 11:01.544
Ah, don't worry about it, man.
You formed a roving network

11:01.612 --> 11:03.613
of paramedics. It's pretty
genius. Batman would be proud.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.781
- You think?
- Yeah.

11:05.849 --> 11:09.218
Yeah, I don't know. We covered all the hot
spots in the city. If your boy is out there,

11:09.286 --> 11:13.020
- we would have found him.
- Maybe he took the night off.

11:13.088 --> 11:15.590
I still got about 10 minutes on my shift.
You want me to keep driving?

11:15.658 --> 11:20.862
<i>- Baker-12 calling University-21. Come in.</i>
<i>- Yeah, go ahead, B-1-twiz.</i>

11:20.929 --> 11:23.164
<i>Either we're</i>
<i>losing our minds too,</i>

11:23.232 --> 11:25.567
<i>or we may have</i>
<i>spotted your guy.</i>

11:25.635 --> 11:28.435
- Excellent. Where at?
<i>- Heading down</i>

11:28.503 --> 11:30.271
<i>Indian Crescent.</i>
<i>We've lost visual now,</i>

11:30.338 --> 11:33.274
<i>- but he's out here somewhere.</i>
<i>- Roger that. Thank you.</i>

11:33.341 --> 11:34.808
- Nice.
- Lock and load.

11:34.876 --> 11:36.877
(siren)

11:47.354 --> 11:49.355
Hey, whoa, stop here.

11:49.423 --> 11:51.591
Yeah, over there.
Put your lights on him.

11:54.428 --> 11:56.496
Hey there.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.901
How you doing?
You all right?

12:02.968 --> 12:04.536
(man groaning)

12:04.604 --> 12:06.538
Let's take a peak here.
We're here to help you out.

12:06.606 --> 12:08.273
Watch yourself, Toby.

12:08.341 --> 12:10.575
Ooh, OK. Ooh, OK.

12:10.643 --> 12:12.577
Hey, buddy, you OK?
You look like you just went

12:12.645 --> 12:14.546
a few rounds with the Hulk.
You know where you are?

12:14.614 --> 12:17.348
- You know your name?
- I'm Captain Nightfall.

12:17.416 --> 12:18.716
Whoa.

12:21.788 --> 12:23.856
So, how's he doing?

12:23.924 --> 12:26.025
Well, he took a pretty good beating,
but it could have been worse.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.293
His, um, costume cushioned
the blow somewhat.

12:28.361 --> 12:30.329
I wonder if that vest is
bullet proof.

12:30.396 --> 12:33.798
He's lucky he didn't have
to find out. Nothing's broken,

12:33.866 --> 12:35.867
but he'll be sore
for a few days. Uh, we also ran

12:35.935 --> 12:37.936
some blood work while he was
out, but now that he's awake

12:38.003 --> 12:40.105
and refusing to give us
his health card or any

12:40.172 --> 12:42.173
personal information,
we can't treat him any further.

12:42.241 --> 12:43.842
- You're going to release him?
- Soon, yeah.

12:43.909 --> 12:46.244
Just waiting for the on-call
doctor to sign off on him.

12:46.311 --> 12:49.280
- Thanks, Sandy.
- I'll see you later?

12:49.348 --> 12:51.381
Yeah, you will.

12:54.119 --> 12:56.304
Hey. How are you feeling?

12:56.422 --> 12:57.516
I'll be fine.

12:57.562 --> 13:00.390
Is there something we can
call you besides Captain Nightfall?

13:00.458 --> 13:03.460
No.
<i>There is no more Tim.</i>

13:03.527 --> 13:05.295
Safeguarding your secret
identity. I can respect that.

13:05.363 --> 13:07.797
I mean, nobody knew who Batman
was under the cowl, right?

13:07.865 --> 13:11.033
- It's Bruce Wayne.
- Well, that was a bad example.

13:11.101 --> 13:13.803
So, what happened?
Who did this to you?

13:16.439 --> 13:18.808
(men grunting)

13:18.876 --> 13:20.977
Were you trying
to prevent another robbery?

13:21.044 --> 13:23.745
Look, somebody has to keep
these neighbourhoods safe.

13:23.813 --> 13:26.114
No family should have
to live in fear.

13:26.182 --> 13:27.615
Hey, I couldn't agree more.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.617
That's why my buddy, T here,
is on the case.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.319
The cops are useless.

13:31.387 --> 13:33.288
I've accomplished more in one
night than they have in a month.

13:33.355 --> 13:36.591
So, how'd you get involved in this?
(he sighs)

13:36.659 --> 13:38.826
I... I was out patrolling,

13:38.894 --> 13:40.895
and I heard the commotion,

13:40.962 --> 13:43.363
and I saw these two goons
beating on a defenceless man.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.565
I confronted them,
they got away.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.835
I've been tracking them
ever since.

13:47.903 --> 13:50.838
So, why the costume, the codename?
Why not just be yourself?

13:50.906 --> 13:52.907
Because that would put
my family at risk.

13:52.974 --> 13:55.809
- This is enough. I've had enough. Just go.
- Happy? Goodbye to my own son!

13:55.876 --> 13:58.544
Now it's time for me
to make mine. Off you go!

13:58.612 --> 14:02.481
- Hey, I've got your paperwork ready at the desk.
- OK, thanks.

14:05.252 --> 14:06.820
We'll talk again.

14:09.856 --> 14:12.691
- Hey. I got your message.
- You should probably get back to work.

14:12.758 --> 14:14.726
- Oh, hey. Yeah. OK.
- Where is he?

14:14.794 --> 14:16.695
He's in emerg.
He's about to be released.

14:16.762 --> 14:18.396
OK, well, Klein wants him
brought in for questioning.

14:18.464 --> 14:20.899
Well, he's trying to help out.
He has no part in this.

14:20.967 --> 14:24.102
No, we don't know that. He knew where they
were going to strike next. I want to know how.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.637
Hey, have you guys seen
your superhero? He hasn't been

14:26.705 --> 14:29.941
- officially discharged, but his costume's gone.
- He's gone?

14:30.008 --> 14:32.609
- Please tell me you got an ID.
- I think his first name is Tim.

14:32.677 --> 14:35.112
(cell phone ringing)

14:35.180 --> 14:36.613
Yeah.

14:36.681 --> 14:38.549
OK, we're on our way.

14:44.255 --> 14:47.157
OK, facial recognition
only found the one match, so...

14:47.225 --> 14:50.593
- is that our guy?
- It's hard to tell with the beard.

14:50.661 --> 14:52.295
He has a history

14:52.363 --> 14:54.464
of violent crime,
did a stint for armed robbery.

14:54.531 --> 14:56.532
Looks like he got released
two months ago.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.368
That's right around the time
our crime spree started.

14:59.435 --> 15:02.404
Yeah, but he's small time.
There's no way he planned something on this scale.

15:02.472 --> 15:06.008
If he is responsible, he's working for someone else.
Do we have an address or a place

15:06.076 --> 15:09.278
- of employment?
- Uh... well, if anyone knows how to get a hold of him,

15:09.346 --> 15:11.847
it'll be his parole officer.
Let's get him out of bed.

15:19.188 --> 15:22.223
♪ I'm frightened
I'll do something wrong ♪

15:26.528 --> 15:31.031
♪ Without thinking ♪

15:33.402 --> 15:39.139
♪ And all this love ♪

15:39.207 --> 15:43.176
♪ I can't do anything ♪

15:43.244 --> 15:45.279
♪ Tonight ♪

15:50.017 --> 15:51.951
I didn't really
picture Hawn

15:52.019 --> 15:54.053
- as the flyer-delivery type.
- Well, there's not a lot

15:54.121 --> 15:57.457
of work out there for ex-cons, and gainful
employment is part of his parole.

15:57.525 --> 16:00.993
- That gives him a great opportunity to case houses.
- I already thought of that,

16:01.061 --> 16:04.229
but none of the target houses were on his route--
they weren't even in the same neighbourhoods.

16:06.265 --> 16:08.834
- Eric Hawn?
- Yeah?

16:08.902 --> 16:11.637
- Hey. IIB.
- We have a few questions

16:11.704 --> 16:15.106
- for you about some recent robberies.
- Sure, just give me a sec.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.962
This is a composite of the man
you saw in the read.

16:39.029 --> 16:41.531
So, do we have any idea who
this guy is in relation to Hawn?

16:41.599 --> 16:43.533
I mean,
he could be his boss,

16:43.601 --> 16:46.503
his partner--I can't say
for sure. I just got a face.

16:46.571 --> 16:49.739
All right, so if we get a match we'll see
where it leads. In the meantime, I've had

16:49.807 --> 16:52.374
Metro put an APB out for Hawn.
For now he's still

16:52.442 --> 16:54.710
- our only link to these crimes.
- Maybe not. I mean,

16:54.778 --> 16:58.481
Nightfall knew exactly where Hawn and
his partner were going to strike next.

16:58.548 --> 17:02.351
- He even claimed to be tracking them.
- Tracking them how?

17:02.418 --> 17:05.387
Well, he didn't get
that specific, but...

17:05.454 --> 17:07.421
I still haven't decided
if this guy is a misguided

17:07.490 --> 17:11.058
good Samaritan, a dangerous
vigilante, or a complete whack-job.

17:11.126 --> 17:13.528
- Probably all of the above.
- If he could help us,

17:13.596 --> 17:15.429
I think we should let him.

17:15.498 --> 17:18.031
You know where he is?

17:18.099 --> 17:20.602
I think I can
find him, yeah.

17:20.669 --> 17:23.203
OK. I'll have Metro
pick him up.

17:23.270 --> 17:25.238
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Let me do this my way.

17:25.306 --> 17:27.808
He's not a fan of cops. I think
I can get through to him.

17:27.876 --> 17:32.445
I can't even believe
I'm contemplating this.

17:32.514 --> 17:34.097
- Fine.
- Thank you.

17:34.129 --> 17:35.684
Go find Batman.

17:35.984 --> 17:38.886
[Oz]: So, you recognize
anything yet?

17:38.953 --> 17:42.522
No, but the angle of the tower
is right. We should be close.

17:42.589 --> 17:45.892
- I can't believe you guys are going to team up.
- It's not a team-up.

17:45.959 --> 17:49.362
- I've just got to talk to the guy.
- Well, that's how it starts.

17:49.430 --> 17:52.332
You don't like each other, then you talk,
you realize it was all a misunderstanding,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.367
and then you team up
to defeat a common foe!

17:54.435 --> 17:57.537
- Yeah, that's not going to happen.
- Hey, so, uh,

17:57.604 --> 18:00.406
I made an appointment at a
dealership to go for a test drive.

18:00.473 --> 18:02.909
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you want to come

18:02.976 --> 18:05.411
with me? I could use
a lady's perspective.

18:08.448 --> 18:10.416
<i>My son, right?</i>
<i>Bye to my own son!</i>

18:10.483 --> 18:13.818
You made your choices. Now
it's time for me to make mine!

18:13.886 --> 18:16.821
Hey, hey, hey. Pull over here.
There he is.

18:25.297 --> 18:27.665
All right, thanks.
See you.

18:46.717 --> 18:48.952
Hey, Tim.

18:49.019 --> 18:51.854
That's your name when you're
not Nightfall, isn't it?

18:51.922 --> 18:55.058
- How the hell did you find me?
- That's your kid back there, is it?

18:55.125 --> 18:59.462
Yeah, that's... that's my kid.
My wife, she won't let me anywhere near him.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.430
She won't even let me talk to him.
I mean, how messed up is that, right?

19:02.498 --> 19:04.499
<i>Kid loves his comic books more</i>
<i>than he loves his old man.</i>

19:04.567 --> 19:07.569
I'm not here to give you
a hard time, man. I'm...

19:07.637 --> 19:10.505
- I need your help.
- What kind of help would a cop want from me?

19:10.573 --> 19:12.540
I'm not a cop.
I'm a consultant.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.409
All I need to know is
how you figured out

19:14.477 --> 19:19.747
- where those robbers were going to strike next.
- No way. Trade secret.

19:19.815 --> 19:24.018
You know, I saw those flash tubes you made.
They're pretty impressive.

19:24.086 --> 19:27.021
Yeah. I've always been pretty
handy with the gadgets,

19:27.089 --> 19:30.091
and electronics too.
I used to work in computers.

19:30.159 --> 19:32.559
Cool. You, uh, you think
you can maybe show me

19:32.627 --> 19:34.794
these electronics?
(police siren)

19:37.098 --> 19:39.666
- What is this?
- I don't know.

19:39.734 --> 19:43.103
- What is this?! You son of a bitch! You set me up! Why?
- Whoa, whoa, Tim! Relax!

19:43.171 --> 19:45.239
I have no idea
what's going on here.

19:45.306 --> 19:48.441
- [Constable]: Timothy Lamb. Please come with me.
- What's happening?

19:51.445 --> 19:53.446
Sorry, hey, IIB.

19:53.514 --> 19:56.549
- Who called this in?
- The wife.

19:56.617 --> 19:58.817
Guy's not supposed to be
around her or the kid.

19:58.885 --> 20:02.588
Come on. That restraining order is total crap.
She can't keep me away from my kid.

20:02.656 --> 20:05.357
Inside.

20:05.424 --> 20:08.627
(cell phone ringing)
All right. Whoa.

20:10.630 --> 20:13.265
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Toby. It's Sandy.</i>

20:13.332 --> 20:15.751
We got the blood work back 
on your friend from last night.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.424
Hey, yeah, is everything OK?

20:17.470 --> 20:19.471
Normally
this would be privileged

20:19.539 --> 20:22.139
doctor-patient information,
but, um, since the patient

20:22.207 --> 20:25.108
<i>- is MIA and you're the one who brought him in...</i>
<i>- What'd you find?</i>

20:25.177 --> 20:27.811
He has a rare degenerative
blood disorder.

20:27.879 --> 20:30.747
<i>There's really very little we can do
other than make him more comfortable.</i>

20:30.815 --> 20:32.816
So what are you saying
exactly, Sandy?

20:34.852 --> 20:38.221
He's dying, Toby. He has maybe
eight months, a year left at most.

20:44.402 --> 20:48.704
- Did you find the guy from Toby's read of Hawn?
- No. Couldn't get a match.

20:48.772 --> 20:51.874
- The guy's probably never been in the system.
- What about the pawn shops?

20:51.941 --> 20:53.975
Yeah, came up empty.

20:54.043 --> 20:56.278
No one's moving the stolen goods
yet, which leaves us trying

20:56.345 --> 20:58.380
to figure out where
our perps will strike next.

20:58.448 --> 21:01.916
There's 16 target houses
in nine separate neighbourhoods.

21:01.983 --> 21:06.020
Now, we know the crime itself, it isn't
random, but there's still no discernible

21:06.087 --> 21:08.856
order to which
these houses were hit.

21:08.924 --> 21:12.460
I even looked to see if maybe they all joined
together to form, like, a giant pentagram

21:12.528 --> 21:15.062
or the face of Elvis
or something, but they did not.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.431
- So we're back to square one.
- No, maybe not.

21:17.498 --> 21:19.900
I also built a profile
on each neighbourhood

21:19.967 --> 21:23.603
where one or more robberies have occurred,
and from there was able to extrapolate three

21:23.671 --> 21:27.373
other areas that closely match the same
parameters but haven't yet been targeted.

21:27.442 --> 21:30.644
So the next robbery could happen
in one of those three areas.

21:30.711 --> 21:32.771
Based on the profile,
there's a good chance of that.

21:33.201 --> 21:34.373
Nice work.

21:36.450 --> 21:38.784
Thought you might want

21:38.852 --> 21:41.286
to get to know your hero
a little more.

21:41.354 --> 21:43.422
Amateur boxer
turned IT technician.

21:43.490 --> 21:45.758
Brains and brawn.
Too bad he didn't use

21:45.826 --> 21:48.026
his gifts
a little more wisely.

21:48.094 --> 21:50.728
Aggravated assault, DUI--
Why am I looking at this stuff?

21:50.796 --> 21:53.798
He's not the avenging angel
you seem to think he is.

21:53.866 --> 21:55.700
I think I can
get through to this guy.

21:55.768 --> 21:59.103
Why is this
so personal to you?

21:59.171 --> 22:02.807
He reminds me
a bit of myself.

22:02.875 --> 22:06.610
Do I agree with his methods? No.
But I think his heart's in the right place.

22:06.678 --> 22:09.680
Well, don't fool yourself.
He's not you.

22:09.747 --> 22:12.816
Maybe he's not, but I think
that I can stop this guy

22:12.884 --> 22:15.619
from getting himself or someone
he cares about killed.

22:15.687 --> 22:19.155
You see, that kind of talk
freaks me out.

22:21.392 --> 22:23.826
Do you want a coffee
or something?

22:23.894 --> 22:26.395
No, I don't want
a coffee or something.

22:26.463 --> 22:28.698
God, you just don't give up,
do you? Man.

22:33.971 --> 22:36.038
We got something for you.

22:39.642 --> 22:41.442
OK. Yeah, thanks.

22:41.511 --> 22:43.678
- Can I go now?
- You've got to read it.

22:43.746 --> 22:46.180
You... you understand that?

22:46.248 --> 22:48.717
It means that I'm
a walking dead man, yeah.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.653
- I got it. Thanks.
- So you know this already?

22:51.721 --> 22:54.522
Hey. I'm on your side.

22:54.589 --> 22:58.592
I know I can't save
my own life, OK?

22:58.660 --> 23:01.795
All I'm trying to do is save
somebody else's.

23:01.863 --> 23:04.297
Why is that such
a terrible thing?

23:04.365 --> 23:08.135
I'd rather go out in a blaze of
<i>glory than in a hospital bed.</i>

23:14.775 --> 23:17.209
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:17.277 --> 23:20.246
- What's up?
- We found Hawn.

23:20.313 --> 23:23.249
<i>What we can tell you is that the
body was found in this alley</i>

23:23.316 --> 23:26.151
<i>just a few hours ago.
 The victim of the shooting has</i>

23:26.218 --> 23:29.588
<i>just been identified</i>
<i>as 32-year-old Eric Hawn.</i>

23:29.656 --> 23:32.658
<i>So far no arrests have been made</i>
<i>in connection with the crime,</i>

23:32.725 --> 23:35.527
<i>and Toronto Metro Police are</i>
<i>asking anyone with possible</i>

23:35.595 --> 23:38.463
<i>- information to plea--</i>
<i>- Homeless man found him.</i>

23:38.531 --> 23:40.666
Two shots to the chest
from close range.

23:40.733 --> 23:43.200
Someone didn't like the fact
that we were closing in on Hawn.

23:43.268 --> 23:46.571
There's no witnesses, but we're
checking security cameras in the area.

23:46.638 --> 23:50.441
Forensics did find this.
It was on Hawn's jacket. It looks like

23:50.508 --> 23:52.743
- an audio surveillance device.
- Someone put a bug on him.

23:52.811 --> 23:55.913
Yeah, the lab is taking a look now.
I'm gonna go check in with them. You want to come?

23:55.981 --> 23:57.881
(cell phone ringing)
Actually, uh,

23:57.949 --> 23:59.916
- I'll catch you up.
- OK.

24:02.319 --> 24:04.320
Hey. Tia, what's up?

24:04.388 --> 24:07.523
Hey, I just thought I'd check in and
see if those phone tips paid off.

24:07.592 --> 24:09.926
<i>I can't talk specifics,</i>
<i>but, yeah, they paid off.</i>

24:09.994 --> 24:11.628
<i>Thank you. I owe you.</i>

24:11.696 --> 24:14.362
See? Now we're
getting somewhere.

24:14.430 --> 24:17.066
Mm-hmm.
How about dinner? My treat.

24:17.133 --> 24:18.968
Forget dinner.
I want the exclusive.

24:19.035 --> 24:21.003
You don't even know
what the story is yet.

24:21.071 --> 24:23.371
It doesn't matter. If it's
connected to the home invasion,

24:23.439 --> 24:26.609
then it's got front-page potential, and
that's like our currency around here, so...

24:26.676 --> 24:28.644
All right. I get it.
I'll see what I can do.

24:28.712 --> 24:31.646
- Thank you. That's all I'm asking.
- Cool.

24:35.283 --> 24:38.319
Yeah, so, the lab confirmed
that that bug wasn't

24:38.386 --> 24:42.023
just a simple audio transmitter;
it also has GPS capabilities.

24:42.091 --> 24:44.892
- A tracking device.
- Exactly. And they also confirmed that it's homemade,

24:44.960 --> 24:47.661
just like those flash tubes found
at the Rosedale crime scene.

24:47.729 --> 24:50.597
That explains how Nightfall knew
where Hawn was going to strike next.

24:50.665 --> 24:52.866
Yeah, I should never
have let him go. He may know

24:52.934 --> 24:56.937
- who actually killed Hawn.
- Maybe, maybe not. I mean, he was in police custody

24:57.005 --> 25:00.173
- at the time of the murder.
- Hey, guys. I've got to show you something.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.011
So, the only camera
that was near the alleyway

25:05.078 --> 25:07.947
where Hawn got murdered was in a
parking lot across the street.

25:08.015 --> 25:10.816
- Are you saying we have him on camera?
- No.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.752
But see that car pulling in?

25:12.819 --> 25:14.920
Keep your eyes on it.

25:17.590 --> 25:19.557
Hey, that's the guy
that I got from Hawn.

25:19.625 --> 25:23.862
I already ran his plate.
His name is, uh, Albert Jacoby.

25:23.929 --> 25:27.666
He's an investment consultant at Reiser
Financial, a local private investment firm.

25:27.733 --> 25:30.935
What's an investment consultant doing
getting mixed up with an ex-con?

25:31.003 --> 25:32.937
Let's go find out.

25:33.005 --> 25:35.139
Here's the kind of people
I associate with:

25:35.206 --> 25:39.710
doctors, lawyers, CEOs, CFOs--

25:39.778 --> 25:43.047
your garden-variety multi-millionaires,
the kind of people

25:43.114 --> 25:47.718
who are extremely conscientious about
who handles their investment capital.

25:47.786 --> 25:51.387
So, uh, you can see
that, uh, consorting

25:51.454 --> 25:54.389
with known criminals would be
counterintuitive to my job.

25:54.436 --> 25:55.319
Sure.

25:55.358 --> 25:59.361
Yeah, you got a nice office.
You must do pretty well for yourself.

25:59.429 --> 26:01.731
Not as well as the boys
on the 18th floor,

26:01.799 --> 26:04.133
but, uh, yeah,
sure, I do OK.

26:04.201 --> 26:06.201
What were you doing
in the parking lot?

26:06.268 --> 26:08.837
I was just picking up
my dry cleaning.

26:08.905 --> 26:12.340
I have a receipt here
somewhere.

26:12.408 --> 26:15.043
This was supposed to be simple.

26:15.111 --> 26:17.212
You all right?
You seem a little nervous.

26:17.279 --> 26:19.347
Of course not.
I'm fine, perfectly fine.

26:19.415 --> 26:21.249
<i>Just be cool.</i>

26:21.317 --> 26:23.283
<i>If they had a warrant,</i>
<i>they'd have issued it by now.</i>

26:23.351 --> 26:26.520
Got it.

26:26.588 --> 26:29.656
Here. Anything else?

26:29.725 --> 26:32.226
No, that's
good enough for us.

26:32.293 --> 26:35.096
He was worried we had a search warrant.
I think he's hiding something.

26:35.163 --> 26:37.797
Well, we don't have enough
to get a search warrant. Yeah?

26:37.865 --> 26:40.566
It's me. I just got word
from Metro. There's been

26:40.633 --> 26:43.335
- another home invasion.
- We're on our way.

26:46.099 --> 26:48.633
(police radio chatter)

26:51.737 --> 26:54.605
It was terrifying.
All I kept thinking was:

26:54.672 --> 26:56.874
"Please, don't let us end up
like that poor woman."

26:56.941 --> 27:00.144
- The one who was killed.
- How many of them were there?

27:00.212 --> 27:03.680
- Two. Both wore ski masks.
- Did they take anything?

27:03.748 --> 27:05.582
DVD player,

27:05.650 --> 27:08.085
some jewellery,
a few hundred dollars cash,

27:08.153 --> 27:10.320
and my wife's
wedding ring.

27:10.388 --> 27:12.155
That's how I got this.

27:12.223 --> 27:13.890
Well, you two are fine now.

27:16.127 --> 27:18.861
So, we have two perps--
same as always.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.331
Either Hawn's already been
replaced, or they were always

27:21.399 --> 27:25.035
working with a bigger crew,
rotating guys between jobs.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.003
You see this?

27:28.071 --> 27:30.572
Sorry, uh, is that your laptop
out there?

27:30.640 --> 27:35.210
It is. We got lucky on that one.
All our personal stuff's on it.

27:35.278 --> 27:39.381
So, what, they take a DVD player
but they don't take a laptop?

27:42.951 --> 27:45.953
I compared this list of stolen items
with lists from the other target houses,

27:46.021 --> 27:48.989
- and I found a commonality.
- Something taken from each house?

27:49.058 --> 27:51.926
Actually, it's, um,
it's what wasn't taken.

27:51.993 --> 27:54.862
Computers.

27:54.930 --> 27:59.666
Yeah. Exactly. At each house, at least
one of the computers was left untouched.

27:59.733 --> 28:02.869
So maybe the robberies are just
a cover-up for another crime.

28:02.937 --> 28:04.571
Exactly. It's a good theory,

28:04.638 --> 28:06.806
but I need to look at those
computers so I can confirm it.

28:06.874 --> 28:09.576
Well, I'm sure the victims
will be happy to cooperate.

28:09.643 --> 28:12.112
What's wrong?

28:12.180 --> 28:15.081
I just got a text saying that
Albert Jacoby's office was

28:15.148 --> 28:17.950
- broken into.
- He sent you a text directly?

28:18.017 --> 28:20.652
- No, it's unknown.
- Let me run the number.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.989
This gives us a legal excuse
to go poke around.

28:26.826 --> 28:29.828
(knocking at door)
Mr. Jacoby?

28:29.896 --> 28:32.397
I wasn't expecting
another visit so soon.

28:32.465 --> 28:34.099
What can I do for you?

28:34.166 --> 28:36.934
- What happened here?
- Nothing,

28:37.002 --> 28:38.570
just a little incident.

28:38.637 --> 28:40.705
Looks like someone turned
this place over pretty good.

28:40.772 --> 28:43.475
No, it's fine.
Really. This is

28:43.542 --> 28:45.510
nothing to bother
the police about.

28:49.180 --> 28:50.447
Damn it.

28:50.515 --> 28:53.083
So, everything's here?
Nothing's missing?

28:53.151 --> 28:55.051
Yes, everything is
accounted for. Not a problem.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.488
But I do thank you
for your concern.

28:57.555 --> 29:02.791
OK, well, if you change your mind and you
want to report this, give us a call.

29:02.859 --> 29:04.494
OK.

29:07.197 --> 29:11.601
- [Klein]: That son of a bitch.
- The footage was taken from Reiser Financial

29:11.668 --> 29:14.604
- earlier this evening.
- I think Nightfall's the one who tipped us off.

29:14.671 --> 29:18.273
Well, the text was sent from an internet phone
provider, but I'd say it's a same assumption.

29:18.341 --> 29:21.176
- He wants us to know he's helping us.
- This is his idea

29:21.244 --> 29:24.112
of helping us? He could derail
the entire investigation.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.782
Yeah, but why would he trash the place?
What was he looking for? And how did he know

29:27.850 --> 29:30.118
- about Jacoby in the first place?
- Damn it.

29:33.922 --> 29:37.291
- Here's your answer.
- What?

29:39.994 --> 29:42.963
He put a bug on me just like
he did with Eric Hawn.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.666
He was listening to us,
he knew where we were--

29:45.733 --> 29:48.235
(static and muffled speaking)

29:50.237 --> 29:53.406
He heard me say that Jacoby was
hiding something in his office.

29:53.474 --> 29:57.610
OK, you know what? That's it.
I want this Tim Lamb brought in. Now.

30:03.738 --> 30:04.660
<i>Yes?</i>

30:04.691 --> 30:07.452
<i>Albert Jacoby?</i>
<i>I have what you're looking for.</i>

30:07.520 --> 30:09.488
- What?
<i>- Your laptop.</i>

30:09.556 --> 30:11.723
- Who is this? I-I don't--
<i>- If you want it back,</i>

30:11.791 --> 30:14.059
it'll be a million in cash
tonight.

30:14.126 --> 30:16.328
I'll text you the location.
Come alone.

30:19.332 --> 30:21.200
Well, he's not here.

30:21.267 --> 30:23.267
And if he were,
I'd have him arrested.

30:23.335 --> 30:26.704
- Do you have any idea where he might be?
- Try the bar.

30:26.771 --> 30:29.873
- Which one?
- Any one. Tim was never really fussy.

30:29.941 --> 30:33.043
- Well, thank you for your time.
- Is my dad in trouble?

30:33.111 --> 30:35.546
Maybe Captain Nightfall can
help him.

30:35.614 --> 30:38.215
Now's really not the time,
OK, Dustin?

30:38.282 --> 30:40.217
I'm sorry. He's obsessed

30:40.284 --> 30:43.186
with comic books.
It's all he talks about lately.

30:43.254 --> 30:46.089
Mrs. Lamb, do you have
a recent picture of Tim

30:46.156 --> 30:48.491
- that we could have?
- Sure. In the den, I think.

30:48.559 --> 30:52.161
Dustin,
you know Captain Nightfall?

30:52.230 --> 30:54.118
He's my friend.

30:54.289 --> 30:55.829
He comes to visit me
sometimes.

30:55.876 --> 30:58.720
Oh, cool, man. When was
the last time you saw him?

30:58.801 --> 31:02.871
A few hours ago. But he said
he couldn't see me anymore.

31:02.939 --> 31:05.241
He said that I have to stay up
and watch the news tonight.

31:05.308 --> 31:07.576
Yeah? Did he say
anything else?

31:07.644 --> 31:09.745
<i>I promised</i>
<i>I'd keep it safe for him.</i>

31:12.281 --> 31:14.716
Did he give you something?

31:14.783 --> 31:17.452
You know, we might be able
to use it to help your father.

31:17.519 --> 31:20.921
Can you get if for me?
Oh, thanks.

31:25.093 --> 31:27.761
So, Tim left this stuff
with his kid earlier.

31:27.828 --> 31:30.930
What do we have?
A laptop, keys, cash.

31:30.998 --> 31:33.967
Yeah, his personal stuff.
He's not expecting to need them anymore.

31:34.034 --> 31:37.971
Well, maybe there's something on the
laptop that will lead us to him.

31:38.038 --> 31:41.541
Hello. Come to Daddy now.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.876
(computer beeping)
There you are.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.511
Hey. Is that the computer

31:45.579 --> 31:47.480
- from the last break-in?
- Yeah,

31:47.547 --> 31:49.515
- and it's been tampered with.
- How so?

31:49.583 --> 31:52.151
It's been infected with
a sophisticated form of spyware

31:52.218 --> 31:54.453
that copies information and
transfers it to an outside system.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.423
It's great for stealing intel
that normal hacking can't crack,

31:57.491 --> 31:59.924
like secure accounts
with layers of encryption.

31:59.992 --> 32:02.460
Right. And they did this
without anyone noticing?

32:02.528 --> 32:06.398
Well, it's as simple as plugging in
a flash drive and hitting Enter.

32:06.465 --> 32:09.301
OK, so, where does
the information go exactly?

32:09.368 --> 32:12.236
Any computer can be set up
as a receiver

32:12.305 --> 32:13.938
and record data
from any number of targets.

32:14.006 --> 32:16.006
You're kidding.

32:16.073 --> 32:19.310
I think I know what Nightfall
stole from Jacoby's office.

32:19.377 --> 32:22.446
He left the evidence
with his kid for safekeeping.

32:25.350 --> 32:29.820
So, Jacoby's computer contains all the financial
information of every one of our victims.

32:29.887 --> 32:32.755
Bank balances,
trading account numbers,

32:32.823 --> 32:35.758
passwords-- luckily no money
has been transferred yet.

32:35.826 --> 32:38.394
But without this laptop,
he can't access anything.

32:38.462 --> 32:40.530
Jacoby would kill
to get this back.

32:40.597 --> 32:43.566
Didn't you say that Lamb told his
kid to watch the news tonight?

32:43.634 --> 32:46.802
Yeah, I'm guessing he's
planning to confront Jacoby.

32:46.869 --> 32:48.804
But without this to trade,
he's a dead man.

32:48.871 --> 32:51.473
I think that was
always the plan.

32:54.377 --> 32:58.146
Doesn't she handle beautifully?
The test drive is my secret weapon.

32:58.214 --> 33:00.682
Once you're behind the wheel
of this baby, you're sold.

33:00.750 --> 33:03.317
Hey, what do you think, Toby?
Red Thunder 2.0?

33:03.385 --> 33:06.153
- What's the mileage like?
- Best in its class, hands down.

33:06.221 --> 33:08.155
You hear that?
Hands down he said.

33:08.223 --> 33:10.725
(cell phone ringing)

33:10.792 --> 33:12.793
Michelle, what's up?

33:12.861 --> 33:15.162
Hey. So, Nightfall's
on his way to meet with Jacoby.

33:15.230 --> 33:18.232
- Right now? Are you sure? 
<i>- Yeah, we ran Jacoby's phone records. He was</i>

33:18.299 --> 33:21.100
sent a text demanding a meet
at nine o'clock at a warehouse

33:21.168 --> 33:24.036
a the corner of Queensway and
Cawthra. It was the same phone

33:24.104 --> 33:26.539
used to tip us off to
the robbery at Jacoby's office.

33:26.607 --> 33:29.976
That is why Tim said goodbye to his son tonight.
He's not expecting to get back from this.

33:30.043 --> 33:32.612
I'm leaving now.
Should I pick you up on the way?

33:32.680 --> 33:34.614
Actually, you know what?
I'm closer. I'll meet you there.

33:34.682 --> 33:36.240
- Is everything OK?
- Queensway and Cawthra

33:36.263 --> 33:37.271
in a hurry, man.

33:37.294 --> 33:39.585
 Hey, I've been wantin
to open this baby up. It's time

33:39.652 --> 33:41.653
to take the highway
to the danger zone.

33:41.721 --> 33:45.457
We should take the side streets.
The highway's probably a mess right now.

33:45.525 --> 33:47.659
OK, let's take side streets
to the danger zone.

33:47.727 --> 33:50.596
- I'm sorry, what's happening?
- Oh, don't worry about it, boss. Just buckle up.

33:50.663 --> 33:52.597
It's about to get
a little bumpy.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.700
(tires screeching)

33:55.768 --> 33:57.035
Woooo!

33:57.103 --> 33:59.237
(tires screeching)

34:05.778 --> 34:07.044
Woo-hoo!

34:13.118 --> 34:14.650
Ooh, a little snug there.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.688
[Salesman]: Pull over! Let me
show you the trunk space!

34:18.755 --> 34:21.658
Woo. Man, oh, man. I think
I might have to buy this car.

34:21.688 --> 34:23.955
Great! Why don't we head back and
get the paperwork started?

34:23.985 --> 34:24.735
Thanks for the lift.

34:24.744 --> 34:27.362
- Don't need me to stick around?
- I'd really like to go back now.

34:27.431 --> 34:31.667
- Michelle and Dev are right behind us.
- OK. Hey, be careful.

34:31.735 --> 34:35.938
Hey, so maybe we could talk about a bit of a discount.
I'm a little bit concerned

34:36.005 --> 34:38.507
about some of the wear and tear
on this vehicle.

35:32.493 --> 35:35.327
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to keep you from making a huge mistake.

35:35.395 --> 35:38.163
- Stop interfering in my life.
- You mean your death?

35:38.231 --> 35:40.399
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

35:40.467 --> 35:43.969
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Your son loves comic books.

35:44.037 --> 35:46.938
That's why you created Nightfall
for him--because you want him

35:47.007 --> 35:49.441
to remember you
as a hero.

35:49.509 --> 35:51.909
(door opening)

35:54.946 --> 35:57.482
Here's your ambush,
just like you wanted.

36:05.057 --> 36:07.324
Hey, man.
How you doing?

36:07.392 --> 36:10.560
- Yeah, yeah.
- Texas.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.529
There's no other way for me.

36:12.596 --> 36:15.399
Dying like this does not
make you a hero.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.967
I'm dead no matter what.

36:18.036 --> 36:20.970
Hey, look. I just lost
a close friend of mine,

36:21.039 --> 36:23.540
and my biggest regret is
not being with her near the end.

36:23.607 --> 36:26.643
You do not want Dustin to grow
up with that kind of regret.

36:26.710 --> 36:29.746
It's not too late, Tim.
You can go home,

36:29.813 --> 36:33.349
and you can be
with your son.

36:33.417 --> 36:36.185
Think about it.

36:38.455 --> 36:41.189
I was hoping I'd get
another crack at you.

36:41.257 --> 36:43.859
(gun loaded)
I'm going to enjoy this.

36:46.847 --> 36:49.412
Let's go. Come on.
Move it.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.767
Just deal, man.

36:53.792 --> 36:56.630
Hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

36:56.697 --> 36:59.413
You're working with this clown?
That's entrapment.

36:59.437 --> 37:01.991
Yeah. Why don't you
tell that to the cops

37:02.015 --> 37:04.637
- when they bust you guys?
- I just want my laptop back.

37:04.704 --> 37:08.039
I wish we could help you with that, Albert, but
I don't have it. It's in an evidence locker.

37:08.107 --> 37:10.476
This is not the plan
that we agreed to.

37:10.543 --> 37:12.544
Well, this is what's
happening, so...

37:12.612 --> 37:15.346
what happens next? You going to
kill us like you killed Hawn?

37:15.414 --> 37:17.448
This whole mess was
your doing.

37:17.516 --> 37:20.117
If I go down,
you go down harder.

37:20.185 --> 37:23.154
(gunshot)
The beatings, the dead woman--

37:23.221 --> 37:26.090
you didn't ask for that.
It was just supposed to be a few robberies,

37:26.158 --> 37:28.626
- but it got out of hand.
- Enough! End this or I will.

37:28.694 --> 37:31.528
What? You don't give me
orders. You work for me.

37:31.596 --> 37:34.230
All I ever do is clean up
your messes.

37:34.299 --> 37:37.834
[Tim]: <i>I've still got</i>
<i>a trick up my sleeve.</i>

37:37.902 --> 37:41.405
- Do it.
- Ah! Ah! (gunshot)

37:41.472 --> 37:44.541
[Michelle]: IIB!
Drop your weapons!

37:44.609 --> 37:46.989
- Weapons down!
- Let me see your hands!

37:47.740 --> 37:49.224
All right, all right.

37:49.413 --> 37:53.516
Ballistics going to match this gun
with the one used to kill Hawn?

37:53.583 --> 37:55.751
I'll take that as a yes.

38:00.223 --> 38:02.825
- You OK?
- Yeah.

38:02.892 --> 38:06.661
The bullet just grazed your arm. You're going
to be fine. You know we had a team-up.

38:06.729 --> 38:09.998
- We had a what?
- Thank you for the save.

38:10.066 --> 38:15.670
Yeah, no problem. And thanks for what
you said earlier. You were right.

38:18.107 --> 38:21.108
(cameras clicking)

38:25.580 --> 38:28.482
Klein's going to be happy
to be off the hook with Price.

38:28.550 --> 38:31.585
Yeah, Jacoby's going down
for everything.

38:34.256 --> 38:36.156
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

38:36.224 --> 38:39.425
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

38:39.493 --> 38:41.427
How'd it go?

38:41.495 --> 38:43.463
Well, I just had
an in-depth interview

38:43.530 --> 38:46.432
with a superhero who helped
bring down the major crime ring.

38:46.500 --> 38:50.536
- So, pretty well.
- Oh. Lucky. Lucky. You get everything you need?

38:50.604 --> 38:54.473
Absolutely. He was very
forthcoming and very sweet.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.343
And had a lot of nice things
to say about you.

38:57.410 --> 38:59.511
About me? You sure?
What'd he say?

38:59.579 --> 39:01.613
You'll have to wait
for the article.

39:01.681 --> 39:03.349
All right, I will.

39:03.416 --> 39:06.085
Listen, you...
you've mentioned dinner.

39:06.152 --> 39:09.387
- Is that still an option?
- Yeah.

39:09.454 --> 39:11.689
Great. I'm buying.

39:11.757 --> 39:14.058
And, again,
thank you, Toby.

39:14.126 --> 39:15.493
Thank you.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.628
OK.

39:17.696 --> 39:19.797
OK. No problem.

39:19.865 --> 39:22.000
(reporters talking at once)

39:22.067 --> 39:25.235
- Captain Nightfall! Just a few questions!
- I'm not going to be taking

39:25.303 --> 39:27.237
<i>any questions, if that's OK.
</i>

39:27.305 --> 39:29.239
<i>But I, um...</i>

39:29.307 --> 39:32.075
It's way past
your bedtime, mister.

39:32.143 --> 39:35.212
- Can I just see this?
- OK.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.981
<i>or fight crime to make a difference.
So that's why I've officially decided</i>

39:38.049 --> 39:40.850
<i>to retire from the hero game.
</i>

39:40.918 --> 39:43.853
<i>I want to spend more time</i>
<i>with my son.</i>

39:48.859 --> 39:50.827
It's Dad!

39:50.895 --> 39:52.495
Oh, my god. Tim?

39:52.563 --> 39:54.898
<i>Dustin, son,</i>

39:54.965 --> 39:57.866
<i>if you're watching this</i>
<i>right now,</i>

39:57.934 --> 40:00.268
<i>I love you, pal.</i>

40:02.639 --> 40:05.340
<i>Now get to bed.
It's late.</i>

40:05.408 --> 40:07.108
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:09.779 --> 40:11.814
So, Jacoby gave us everything.

40:11.881 --> 40:16.250
He used his firm's resources to
find suitable targets. The plan was

40:16.318 --> 40:19.554
to sit on the stolen intel until
he had a whole bunch of victims.

40:19.621 --> 40:22.056
So he could drain their
accounts all in one shot.

40:22.123 --> 40:24.592
Yeah, I did the math.
It was close to 50 million.

40:24.660 --> 40:27.862
Phew... That's not a bad
little retirement nest egg.

40:27.930 --> 40:30.263
He swears he tried
to pull the plug

40:30.331 --> 40:32.899
when things turned violent.
Hawn refused to listen.

40:32.967 --> 40:35.702
And that was the night
that Tara Simms was killed.

40:35.770 --> 40:39.038
Yeah, after that, I guess
Jacoby was in too deep.

40:39.106 --> 40:40.807
I hate to admit it,

40:40.875 --> 40:43.543
but Nightfall did us a favour
by trashing Jacoby's office.

40:43.611 --> 40:47.546
I know. That's why
I'm not pursuing his arrest.

40:47.614 --> 40:51.383
Well, that and his promise
to hang up his costume for good.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.918
OK.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.529
Here you go.

41:04.597 --> 41:08.499
- It's decaf. Sorry.
- No, that's fine.

41:08.566 --> 41:11.369
Julia's been taking my new diet
restrictions pretty seriously.

41:11.436 --> 41:13.871
Thank you.
So, you're home now.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.573
- Must feel good.
- Yeah, yeah, it does.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.543
I mean, it's just
on a trial basis, but...

41:19.611 --> 41:22.512
It was my idea, actually.
I... thought it made sense

41:22.579 --> 41:26.182
for Tim to be closer to Dustin
under the circumstances.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.684
Right. So, I guess,
uh, you know.

41:28.752 --> 41:30.186
Yeah.

41:30.254 --> 41:32.455
No more secrets, right?

41:32.523 --> 41:34.690
Right.

41:34.758 --> 41:37.593
I mean, that's how all these problems
got started in the first place.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.729
I was too embarrassed to admit
that I started drinking again,

41:40.796 --> 41:42.697
and everything just kind of
spiralled from there.

41:42.765 --> 41:46.035
That's actually kind of
why I'm here. Um...

41:46.102 --> 41:48.237
I've got a friend

41:48.304 --> 41:50.039
who's a nurse at St. Luke's.

41:50.106 --> 41:52.707
And she would love for you
to come in for a few more tests.

41:52.775 --> 41:55.709
Don't be stubborn.
Listen to him.

41:55.777 --> 41:58.513
Yeah, she thinks that with
a proper course of treatment

41:58.580 --> 42:01.282
maybe they can buy you a little
more time-- as much as a year.

42:01.350 --> 42:03.351
And every second counts.

42:06.821 --> 42:09.190
Yeah, it sure does.

42:09.258 --> 42:13.326
Hey, listen. When we were
at the warehouse...

42:13.394 --> 42:15.228
how did you know
I was gonna make a move?

42:15.296 --> 42:17.064
Trade secret.

42:19.534 --> 42:22.235
He's a pretty good drawer.
You teach him that?

42:22.303 --> 42:24.939
Hey, buddy.

42:25.006 --> 42:27.674
That is awesome. Let me guess:
is that Captain Nightfall?

42:27.741 --> 42:29.742
It's my dad.
