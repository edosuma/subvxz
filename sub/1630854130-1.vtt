fighting or screwing.

20:19.348 --> 20:23.004
They're ripping
each other apart.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.527
Oh, come back, babies.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.269
Come back down here.

20:27.313 --> 20:30.185
Oh, I love those little freaks.

20:30.229 --> 20:35.625
Those little tails.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.846
Who the hell are you?

20:38.889 --> 20:42.153
Who's this, Davy?

20:42.197 --> 20:48.421
Why are you stepping to me
with someone I don't know?

20:48.464 --> 20:49.987
Who are you?

20:50.031 --> 20:52.207
- Hey, this is my--
this is my homie Marcos.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.426
He lives on my block.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.515
- I don't care.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.779
- Well, uh, he just wanted
to meet you real quick.

20:58.822 --> 21:04.045
- I don't meet people.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.830
- He just wanted to talk
to you about that candy

21:06.874 --> 21:09.224
you've been moving, bro.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.704
You're the only
dude brave enough

21:10.747 --> 21:13.837
to sell right now, so kind
of got no other options,

21:13.881 --> 21:15.709
you know?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.667
He wanted a piece.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.374
- That's right.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.159
Police think they got
our block on lock, hm?

21:31.202 --> 21:33.901
You heard they shut
down Los Tamitos?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.424
Raided the whole neighborhood.

21:35.468 --> 21:39.820
Got this little tight ass
girl to snitch on El León.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.866
Police shot her too.

21:42.910 --> 21:46.740
So what did that give us?

21:46.783 --> 21:53.442
Nothing but a new Candyland
and it's all mine.

21:54.443 --> 21:55.575
Come on.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.446
Come on.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.187
- Sarge, they're on the
move walking quickly.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.710
You want us to pull Torres?

22:00.754 --> 22:02.538
- No. Let them move.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.061
Kev, you grab the eye.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.281
- I'm happy to give
you a little taste.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.456
- I want more than that.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.111
- Ah, ah, ah.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.895
What does that mean?

22:11.939 --> 22:13.767
What do you mean?

22:13.810 --> 22:15.943
- No one wants to give
me that powder, bro.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.379
They're all too scared.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.163
I mean, I need half a key.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.610
- Half a key?

22:30.653 --> 22:32.089
- That's right.

22:32.133 --> 22:37.617
- You half key man?

22:37.660 --> 22:42.230
OK, let's go.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.536
Come on, boys, let's go.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.624
- No.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.190
Hey, hey, we could
talk here, man.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.801
- I don't want to.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.368
Get in the car.

22:49.411 --> 22:55.765
- No, we don't want
to go for a ride.

22:55.809 --> 23:02.468
- Why not?

23:02.511 --> 23:04.861
- We are not prepared
to go mobile.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.123
We should walk it back now.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.255
- No.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.213
Atwater, tell Torres to go.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.172
- Sarge, we're not
prepared to engage.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.260
We'd be naked out there.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.175
- Atwater, you got the eye?

23:14.218 --> 23:16.525
- I got him.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.613
- Tell him to go.

23:17.657 --> 23:18.919
- What is he doing?

23:18.962 --> 23:23.010
- It's his call.

23:23.053 --> 23:26.840
- Uh-huh. Let's go, let's go.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.189
- It's all good.

23:28.232 --> 23:35.370
I got time.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.025
They're getting in a brown
sedan, old Nissan model.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.069
- God damn it.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.420
- What?

23:49.384 --> 23:55.259
- Plate number
Henry David 39564.

23:55.303 --> 24:02.310
Burg, Ruze, we're on the
move on Surmac eastbound.

24:03.572 --> 24:08.403
- So where are we trying
to go right now, bro?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.362
- You want a half key.

24:11.406 --> 24:14.757
You got money on
your right now?

24:14.801 --> 24:20.197
- I got some.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.198
- He's going to rip them.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.853
This is a rip.

24:23.897 --> 24:26.073
- If it feels wrong,
Torrez will call it.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.422
He can handle it.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.250
- Jay, he's a PPO
on loan to us.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.730
He's not going to call it.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.209
And he shouldn't have to.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.761
- Talk inside.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.458
- Inside there, huh?

25:03.502 --> 25:06.200
- Enzo is going to jack him
as soon as he goes inside.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.681
- Let it play.

25:08.724 --> 25:13.294
Either Enzo makes a sale or we
spot a firearm, we can move.

25:13.337 --> 25:16.515
- This was supposed
to be a dry meet.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.131
- Only the nicest
places, huh, Enz?

25:24.174 --> 25:25.262
- Nobody's home.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.873
That's what they say.

25:26.916 --> 25:31.617
Nobody's home so you walk
right on by, just like me.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.794
Nobody's home.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.274
Nobody's home.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.320
- There aren't any
drugs in there.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.975
- It's possible.

25:42.018 --> 25:43.542
Hey.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.934
- What?

25:44.978 --> 25:47.371
He's a punk pedaling
diamond nickel bags.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.591
There are a thousand
ways this goes wrong,

25:49.635 --> 25:51.027
so I'm going to get closer.

25:51.071 --> 25:57.860
That way if we have to
bust in, I have eyes.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.259
- Haley, what are you doing?

26:05.302 --> 26:10.917
Get back.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.135
- Candy's right downstairs.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.267
Go on.

26:13.310 --> 26:18.881
Come on, come on.
Right down there.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.230
- You go first.

26:20.274 --> 26:24.844
I'm not getting ripped.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.585
- Ripped?

26:37.596 --> 26:42.513
[laughs] No, I would never.

26:42.557 --> 26:46.605
Here, I'll go first.

26:46.648 --> 26:51.174
Come on.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.046
I'll go first.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.614
Me first, I'll go first.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.014
Just go stand over there.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.251
- What?

27:24.294 --> 27:27.558
What's wrong?

27:27.602 --> 27:28.908
- You're not alone?

27:28.951 --> 27:32.694
- What do you mean?

27:32.738 --> 27:36.306
- Someone come with you here?

27:36.350 --> 27:37.307
- What are you talking about?

27:37.351 --> 27:42.965
You brought us here.

27:43.009 --> 27:47.317
Yo, we doing this?

27:47.361 --> 27:49.232

27:59.678 --> 28:03.769
I'm taking the back.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.380
Offender's heading
for the alley.

28:06.423 --> 28:07.424
- Moving northbound.

28:07.468 --> 28:13.692
We'll cut him off.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.519
- Hey, hey, sir.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.738
- Hey, are you good?

28:16.782 --> 28:17.739
- I'm good.

28:17.783 --> 28:18.653
I'm good.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.786
- Upstairs is clear.

28:20.829 --> 28:21.787
- Lost eyes.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.353
Lost him on 31st.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.659

- Hey, Sarge.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.834
- We don't have eyes.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.096
Guys, nothing.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.751
Advise responding.
Offender's in the wind.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.414
Find me Enzo.

28:40.457 --> 28:41.415
Not you.

28:41.458 --> 28:47.073
Stop.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.815
Explain.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.426
- Torrez was going
in blind and unarmed,

28:52.469 --> 28:54.384
and it looked like he
was going to be jacked.

28:54.428 --> 28:55.821
- And that's your call to make?

28:55.864 --> 28:57.910
- No, it's not.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.433
But you haven't been
making many calls

28:59.476 --> 29:04.743
in the last two weeks.

29:04.786 --> 29:08.442
You're on a one man mission to
patrol one block of the city.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.530
I get it.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.271
I do.

29:11.314 --> 29:14.187
But, Voight, you can
barely even look at me.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.885
I know you blame me
for Anna's death,

29:16.929 --> 29:22.935
and I know that you're not OK.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.067
You're dragging this unit
and you're dragging Jay

29:25.111 --> 29:26.677
through the mud
with you, and you're

29:26.721 --> 29:30.377
going to lose them both.

29:30.420 --> 29:34.337
So, yeah, I made a call.

29:34.381 --> 29:38.298
- You done?

29:38.341 --> 29:40.822
You feel better?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.432
- Hey, a footman
in Little Village

29:42.476 --> 29:44.826
said he spotted a man that
matches Enzo's description

29:44.870 --> 29:46.262
speeding on Surmac.

29:46.306 --> 29:53.008
He lost eyes but that's
enough for us to go on.

29:54.575 --> 29:58.100
- Yo, Sarge, it looks like
Enzo hotwired the vehicle six

29:58.144 --> 29:59.493
blocks away from the house.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.843
The vehicle belonged
to a Garcia Villa, 873.

30:01.887 --> 30:02.844
- Traffic cams?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.280
- Two so far.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.847
31st and California,
31st and Pulaski.

30:05.891 --> 30:06.935
I'm still pulling.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.197
- Got investigative alerts out.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.329
Troopers got eyes
on the highways.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.331
- We'll find him.

30:11.374 --> 30:12.419
- Hey.

30:12.462 --> 30:13.855
Hey.
Hey.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.204
Come here, bro.

30:15.248 --> 30:19.252
Come here.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.950
You cops told me that Enzo
only had three bricks on him.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.517
That ain't enough for 20 grand.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.302
You sent me in there
to get shot on a lie.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.695
- Shot at.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.001
You didn't get shot.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.351
- I've got a gun
pointed at me, bro.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.005
And now I got Madman
Enzo out here knowing

30:33.048 --> 30:34.180
that I work with
the cops for cash,

30:34.223 --> 30:37.792
and I ain't even getting any.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.620
Where the hell that come from?

30:39.663 --> 30:41.230
Ow.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.929
- Take it.

30:43.972 --> 30:47.149
That means you never deal
in Little Village again.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.542
You leave.

30:48.585 --> 30:49.673
- Got him.

30:49.717 --> 30:50.936
- Hey, Sarge, we got something.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.720
- Traffic cams

them on the move.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.672
Go.

32:58.715 --> 32:59.673
Get out of here.

32:59.716 --> 33:00.674
Get off the street.

33:00.717 --> 33:06.854
- Enzo, stop!

33:06.897 --> 33:07.986
- Just ran into 1728.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.726
We got the front.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.250
[gunshots]

33:11.293 --> 33:13.643
- 10-1, 10-1, shots fired.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.472
- Stop chasing me or I'll
kill everyone in here.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.256
You hear me?

33:17.299 --> 33:19.301
I'm going to kill them.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.140
Leave right now or
I kill everybody.

33:32.184 --> 33:36.014
- If you got a shot, take it.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.145
- Can't see inside.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.190
- Can you hear people inside?

33:38.233 --> 33:39.365
- We don't have eyes.

33:39.408 --> 33:40.844
We can't tell if
he has hostages.

33:40.888 --> 33:43.325
Tell me someone's
got something for us.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.326
- We're in the back alley.

33:44.370 --> 33:49.462
Gate's locked.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.246
- All right, the apartment's
owned by the Ramos family.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.509
There's three people registered
living at this address.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.294
- Well, are they home?

33:55.337 --> 33:59.211
- I can't tell.

33:59.254 --> 34:04.172
- Give me one minute, then
get me a diversion out here.

34:04.216 --> 34:08.176
- What?

34:08.220 --> 34:10.526
- Voight, we need
more than a minute.

34:10.570 --> 34:11.962
Burgess and Ruzek
are trying to find

34:12.006 --> 34:15.140
another way through the back.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.532
Voight?

34:16.576 --> 34:18.186
Jay, he's going to
get himself killed.

34:18.230 --> 34:24.932
He can't crash in there alone.

34:26.455 --> 34:29.067
- Sarge, I'm heading to
you to make a crash plan.

34:29.110 --> 34:36.248
- Enzo?

34:44.256 --> 34:46.301
- Clear.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.086
- Clear.
- Clear.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.435
- 5021.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.089
You can give a slow
down on that 10-1.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.960
Offender down.

35:13.981 --> 35:19.682
- Haley?

35:19.726 --> 35:22.424
- We're going to
talk, and we're

35:22.468 --> 35:23.773
only going to do this once.

35:23.817 --> 35:30.040
Then we're never
talking about it again.

35:30.084 --> 35:33.131
Look, I'm OK.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.741
I'm fine.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.786
No?

35:36.830 --> 35:41.748
I am OK.

35:41.791 --> 35:48.581
I'm always going to be OK.

35:48.624 --> 35:54.543
Haley, I can look
you in the eye.

35:54.587 --> 35:59.940
Anna's death was my
fault. Mine alone.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.594
- You don't believe that.

36:08.557 --> 36:15.738
- You are not my keeper,
and you're not each other's.

36:17.262 --> 36:21.788
Look, I'm making choices you
don't like, that is on me.

36:21.831 --> 36:28.447
He's making choices you
don't like, that is on him.

36:28.490 --> 36:32.146
Him alone.

36:32.190 --> 36:39.153
Now we got to be done
with all of this now.

36:40.546 --> 36:45.420
If it ever shows up
on the job again--

36:45.464 --> 36:49.598
The three of us,

36:49.642 --> 36:54.342
we're not working together
anymore, understood?

38:00.234 --> 38:05.283
I wanted to drop that
off for you myself.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.763
We missed you yesterday.

38:07.807 --> 38:10.853
- Yeah, I got swallowed
up in something.

38:10.897 --> 38:17.295
- Sure.

38:17.338 --> 38:20.689
- This really why you came
all the way down here, Pat?

38:26.347 --> 38:29.524
- You know how many of those
things I've thrown out?

38:29.568 --> 38:31.744
- Yeah, I do.

38:31.787 --> 38:34.224
Used to be your thing.

38:41.014 --> 38:45.192
I never thought I'd see
Patty O'Neal in chief stars.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.325
- No, me neither.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.371
I wanted to die in Narcotics.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.374
I could have spent my whole
life busting entrap rooms,

38:53.418 --> 38:59.989
stash houses, going after
men with three bricks.

39:00.033 --> 39:03.471
But there's a lot
more crime in Chicago

39:03.515 --> 39:07.649
right now than
bastards and bricks.

39:07.693 --> 39:11.000
The city's gone to hell.

39:11.044 --> 39:14.613
Tide's turning back to police.

39:14.656 --> 39:15.918
This is the part where
you tell me you're

39:15.962 --> 39:17.964
different from all the rest?

39:18.007 --> 39:19.922
- Yeah.

39:19.966 --> 39:25.580
I'll give you a long
leash, more cash.

39:25.624 --> 39:26.799
You get that kid
Torres that you

39:26.842 --> 39:28.670
like sign up here permanent.

39:28.714 --> 39:33.501
You can handpick your cases.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.024
- But?

39:35.068 --> 39:37.810
- But you've got to
give up the block now.

39:37.853 --> 39:44.686
Los Tamitos, that
case and Avalos,

39:44.730 --> 39:47.472
you got to let that go now.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.429
I gave you two weeks.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.432
I can't give you more.

39:51.476 --> 39:55.741
- I didn't realize you
were being so generous.

40:00.963 --> 40:07.796
- I got Anna Avalos's payment
pushed through the red tape.

Over a half million is going
