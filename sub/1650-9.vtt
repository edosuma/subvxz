Crowd:
Kill 'em! Kill 'em!

00:35.244 --> 00:38.702
Crowd:
Kill 'em! Kill 'em!

00:40.291 --> 00:43.249
- Let me go. Let me go.
- You can't go.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.582
Let him go. Philip.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.876
- Stay out of this.
- He's my friend.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.258
It's not up
to me anymore.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.090
- The people have spoken.
- What?

00:55.264 --> 00:58.097
| asked you where
your loyalties lie.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.723
You said here.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.680
Well, prove it.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.095
Prove it to us all.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.522
- Brother against brother.
- Crowd: Yeah.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.524
Winner goes free.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.811
( crowd cheering )

01:11.989 --> 01:15.072
Fight to the death.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.734
( cheering )

01:19.622 --> 01:22.785
Philip, please.
Don't do this.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.790
Don't do this.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.754
- Man: Let's go, Merle!
- Man #2: Come on, Merle!

01:30.925 --> 01:33.917
- Woman: Yeah, Merle!
- Yeah!

01:34.095 --> 01:37.462
- Y'all know me.
- ( crowd cheering )

01:37.640 --> 01:40.882
I'm gonna do
whatever I got to do

01:42.812 --> 01:44.643
- ( grunts)
- ( cheering)

01:44.814 --> 01:47.226
(coughing)

01:47.400 --> 01:51.313
that my loyalty
is to this town!

01:53.322 --> 01:55.734
( blows landing )

01:55.908 --> 01:59.150
(snarling )

02:07.670 --> 02:09.661
Ah!

02:21.142 --> 02:23.349
You really think this
asshole's gonna let you go?

02:23.519 --> 02:26.101
Just follow my lead,
little brother.

02:26.272 --> 02:29.685
We're getting out
of this right now.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.286
(grunts)

02:47.376 --> 02:49.037
Philip, no.
Stop this.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.712
Philip, stop this!

02:59.597 --> 03:01.087
( crowd gasps )

03:05.478 --> 03:07.059
- ( gunshot)
-( people screaming )

03:13.903 --> 03:15.894
(gunfire)

03:32.463 --> 03:33.919
Come on, little brother.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.923
(yelling)

03:38.677 --> 03:40.008
Stay close!

03:40.179 --> 03:42.170
Daryl!

03:51.107 --> 03:53.439
Merle, come on.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.270
Go!

03:58.614 --> 03:59.945
(gunshot)

04:00.116 --> 04:02.528
- ( screams)
- ( gunshot)

04:04.120 --> 04:05.610
(sighs)

04:18.342 --> 04:19.843
Let's go.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.307
- Rick: Daryl.
- Let's go. Go.

04:37.736 --> 04:37.770
(theme music playing )

04:37.778 --> 04:40.986
(theme music playing )

05:15.774 --> 05:18.766
- ( gunfire)
-( people shouting )

05:23.032 --> 05:25.023
They're all at the arena.
This way.

05:25.201 --> 05:27.032
You're not going
anywhere with us.

05:27.203 --> 05:29.615
You really want
to do this now?

05:29.788 --> 05:31.528
- ( clanging )
- ( Merle grunting )

05:31.707 --> 05:33.208
Come on, man.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.411
( panel opens)

05:35.586 --> 05:37.702
Rick, come on.
We've got to go.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.541
- Go.
- ( thudding)

05:39.715 --> 05:42.878
( Merle grunting )

05:43.052 --> 05:44.883
A little help would be nice.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.386
(snarling )

05:53.229 --> 05:55.891
We ain't got time for this.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.726
Let's go.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.966
Rick: Glenn!

06:27.137 --> 06:29.594
Rick. Rick.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.676
Rick.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.636
Oh, thank God.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.597
Now we got a problem here.
I need you to back up.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.511
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey!

06:37.690 --> 06:39.601
- Hey, put it down!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:39.775 --> 06:41.356
- Put it down!
- He tried to kill me!

06:41.527 --> 06:43.939
- If it wasn't for him--
- He helped us get out of there.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.944
Yeah, right after he beat
the shit out of you.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.606
- Hey, we both took our licks, man.
- Jackass.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.490
-Hey,shutup.
-Enough!

06:50.661 --> 06:53.653
- Hey, hey, relax!
- Put that down now!

06:53.831 --> 06:55.287
Get that thing
out of my face!

06:55.457 --> 06:58.324
( laughs) Man, look like you've
gone native, brother.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.663
No more than you hanging out
with that psycho back there.

07:00.838 --> 07:04.126
Oh, yeah, man. He is a charmer,
I got to tell you that.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.042
Been putting the wood
to your girlfriend Andrea.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.710
- Big time, baby. ( moans)
- Glenn: What?

07:09.888 --> 07:11.799
Andrea's in Woodbury?

07:11.974 --> 07:13.805
Right next to the Governor.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.467
I told you to drop that!

07:16.645 --> 07:18.306
You know Andrea?

07:19.815 --> 07:22.522
Hey, do you know Andrea?

07:22.693 --> 07:25.150
Merle:
Yep, she does.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.232
Her and blondie
spent all winter

07:27.406 --> 07:29.488
cuddling up in the forest.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.274
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Yeah.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.490
My Nubian queen here
had two pet walkers.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.326
No arms,
cut off the jaws,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.331
kept them in chains.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.117
Kind of ironic now
that I think about it.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.661
Shut up, bro.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.875
Hey, man, we snagged them
out of the woods.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.712
Andrea was close to dying.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.626
- Is that why she's with him?
- Merle: Yeah.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.886
Snug as two little bugs.

07:53.057 --> 07:55.673
So what you gonna
do now, Sheriff, huh?

07:55.851 --> 07:57.387
Surrounded by a bunch
of liars, thugs, and cowards.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.017
Shut up!

07:59.188 --> 08:02.351
Oh, man, look at this.
Pathetic.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.185
All these guns
and no bullets in them.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.691
Merle, shut up!

08:05.861 --> 08:07.692
Shut up yourself!
Bunch of pussies you roll--

08:14.787 --> 08:17.244
Asshole.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.416
(door clangs)

08:25.214 --> 08:29.048
You can take those stiches out
yourself in a week or so.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.583
Thank you.

08:30.761 --> 08:34.174
Pretty nice having
medical training.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.714
lt'll only get you so far.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.061
You were bit?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.936
( door opens)

08:51.740 --> 08:53.696
How old is the baby?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.074
Barely a week.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.574
To be honest, we never thought
we'd see another baby.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.837
Beautiful.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.259
Thanks.

09:11.427 --> 09:13.418
How are you feeling?

09:15.806 --> 09:18.172
She's not mine.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.432
Where's the mother?

09:24.106 --> 09:26.097
I'm sorry.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.893
Man, you people have
been through the mill.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.991
It's only getting
worse out there.

09:38.162 --> 09:40.778
Dead are everywhere.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.413
And it's only making
the living

09:43.584 --> 09:46.246
less like the living.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.127
You're the only decent folks
we've come across.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.664
You've been out there
all this time?

09:51.842 --> 09:55.801
Our neighbor Jerry, he was one
of those survivalist nuts.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.427
Everybody on the block
thought he was crazy.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.134
Always preparing
for the end of the world.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.299
- Who knew?
- Jerry knew.

10:01.477 --> 10:04.469
He had a bunker under
his shed in the backyard.

10:04.646 --> 10:08.138
Sasha and I stayed there
until we ran out of supplies.

10:08.317 --> 10:11.480
Allen and Ben were the first
two people we ran into

10:11.653 --> 10:13.439
when we finally crawled
up out of that hole

10:13.614 --> 10:15.445
around Jacksonville.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.072
Used to be a bunch of us.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.699
25 at one point.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.446
Our camp was overrun
six, seven weeks ago.

10:26.043 --> 10:29.001
Tyreese:
And-- and Donna,

10:29.171 --> 10:31.162
she, uh...

10:34.259 --> 10:38.377
We'll see that she has
a proper burial.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.807
I appreciate you
taking care of us.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.716
For a while, we didn't know
who we were dealing with.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.681
Neither did we.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.811
We've had our problems
with people.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.847
I must be the first
brother in history

10:51.026 --> 10:52.857
- to break into prison.
-( Hershel chuckles )

10:53.028 --> 10:55.895
Makes me the first white boy
that didn't want to break out.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.689
( chuckles )

11:04.790 --> 11:07.247
Ty reese.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.831
Like I said, we have
a much larger group.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.745
A close-knit group.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.459
I wouldn't get
too comfortable here.

11:19.763 --> 11:23.051
We wouldn't be a problem.

11:23.225 --> 11:26.137
It's not up to me.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.302
Then who?

11:30.232 --> 11:33.065
Please, you can see
what kind of people we are.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.571
( lock clicks)

11:44.413 --> 11:46.404
Rick:
It won't work.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.868
- Daryl: It's gotta.
- lt'll stirthings up.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.419
Look, the Governor is probably on
the way to the prison right now.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.578
Merle knows how he thinks
and we could use the muscle.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.416
- I'm not having him at the prison.
- He had a gun to our heads.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.798
Do you really want him sleeping in
the same cell block as Carol or Beth?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.458
- He ain't a rapist.
- Well, his buddy is.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.376
They ain't buddies no more.
Not after last night.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.045
There's no way
Merle's gonna live there

12:03.223 --> 12:05.088
without putting everyone
at each other's throats.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.007
So you're gonna cut Merle loose and
bring the last samurai home with us?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.516
She's not coming back.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.769
She's not in a state
to be on her own.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.772
- She did bring you guys to us.
- And then ditched us.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.604
- At least let my dad stitch her up.
- She's too unpredictable.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.315
That's right.
We don't know who she is.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.400
But Merle, Merle's blood.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.566
No, Merle is your blood.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.951
My blood, my family
is standing right here

12:26.121 --> 12:27.782
and waiting for us
back at the prison.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.198
And you're part
of that family.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.618
But he's not.
He's not.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.713
Man, y'all don't know.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.795
Fine.
We'll fend for ourselves.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.634
That's not what
I was saying.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.469
No him, no me.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.135
Daryl, you don't
have to do that.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.474
It was always Merle
and l before this.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.731
- Maggie: Don't.
- Glenn: You serious?

12:55.901 --> 12:58.608
- You're just gonna leave like that?
- You'd do the same thing.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.770
What do you want us
to tell Carol?

13:00.948 --> 13:03.109
She'll understand.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.908
Say good-bye
to your pop for me.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.199
Daryl, are you serious?
Daryl!

13:14.670 --> 13:16.456
Hey. Hey.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.666
There's got to be
another way.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.965
Don't ask me
to leave him.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.127
I already did that once.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.099
We started something
last night.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.886
You realize that, huh?

13:35.065 --> 13:38.057
No him, no me.
That's all I can say.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.022
Take care of yourself.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.192
Take care of Li! Ass-Kicker.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.031
Carl.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.493
He's one tough kid.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.131
Daryl!

14:03.301 --> 14:05.713
Come on, bro.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.561
We patch you up
and then you are gone.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.256
Where'd they say
we could bury her?

14:45.427 --> 14:47.634
Back of the field
near the other graves.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.962
Hey.
Wait a minute.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.472
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.257
Losing my grip here.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.927
Come on, put her down.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.392
Okay.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.451
Golden opportunity.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.335
For what?

15:22.506 --> 15:25.213
Little kid and a woman.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.213
Ask them for a hand,
get a hold of those weapons.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.422
What?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.804
We do it quick, they'll never
know what hit them.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.966
- No. Whoa, whoa.
- We're out here to bury Donna.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.305
And we will, after.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.596
- Shut up.
- Look at this place.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.435
lt's secure.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.850
- These are good people.
- This will be easy.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.815
A little kid, a woman, a girl
and a one-legged old man.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.526
Don't forget about
the convict.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.736
You gonna smash
the baby's head with a rock?

15:52.911 --> 15:55.152
- What is your problem?
- How about a little common decency?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.491
This isn't what we do.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.578
Allen:
You're living in the past, Ty.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.617
So are you.
This is survival

16:02.796 --> 16:04.332
of the fittest,
plain and simple.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.122
- ln here we live, out there we die.
- ( gate opens)

16:07.300 --> 16:08.676
And lam not waiting around

16:08.844 --> 16:10.050
for the rest of their group
to roll in here

16:10.220 --> 16:12.131
- and throw us out on our asses.
- Not a chance.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.557
How do you know
that's gonna happen?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.761
Got some tools for you.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.228
It's much appreciated.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.484
Yeah, we'll take it
from here.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.157
You don't need no help
with the body?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.531
No, we'll manage.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.068
Let us know if you
need anything else.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.202
Thank you.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.374
( gate shuts )

17:13.617 --> 17:15.573
Get the brakes.

17:19.956 --> 17:20.991
(snarling )

17:21.166 --> 17:22.576
I got it.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.742
(grunting)

17:50.278 --> 17:52.610
You didn't kill him.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.115
That's not why
we went back.

17:58.286 --> 18:01.949
No. That's right.
You went back for Daryl.

18:02.123 --> 18:05.456
And now he's gone again
and the Governor is still alive.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.868
- Daryl was the priority.
- I should have been there with you.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.879
- You were in no condition.
- But my girlfriend was?

18:11.049 --> 18:14.462
- Glenn, this isn't about us.
- I should have been there.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.127
Hey, hey, you didn't come back with
us 'cause you could barely walk.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.136
- What about her?
- What about me?

18:19.307 --> 18:21.138
- Do you know what he did to her?!
- Leave it alone!

18:21.309 --> 18:23.925
- Do you know?
- Let's go.

18:33.488 --> 18:37.231
After all that effort,
all the risk we took,

18:37.409 --> 18:39.821
Daryl just takes off
with Merle?

18:41.162 --> 18:42.993
Well, he had his reasons.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.951
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that, Rick.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.663
Doesn't change the fact that
we're up to our necks in shit.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.795
You want me to turn the car around,
beg him to come back?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.671
Throw down a welcome mat
for Merle?

18:53.842 --> 18:56.049
This is the hand
we've been dealt!

18:56.219 --> 18:59.052
Let's just get this out
of here and get back.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.680
Get some rest.
We can talk it out there.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.888
No, you guys do all
the talking you want. I'm done.

19:14.279 --> 19:17.191
( crowd shouting )

19:17.365 --> 19:19.071
How many injured?

19:19.242 --> 19:21.028
Nine.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.863
Stevens has it covered.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.029
So where is he?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.993
- In his apartment.
- And?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.658
He wouldn't open the door.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.451
Said he was in the middle
of something.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.210
It's all going to hell.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.758
(horn honking)

19:35.925 --> 19:39.053
( clamoring )

19:39.220 --> 19:41.211
- Open the gate!
-( horn honking)

19:41.389 --> 19:43.880
( all shouting )

19:46.561 --> 19:48.597
Calm down, people.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.808
- Back away.
- It's not safe here.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.188
We want to leave.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.270
- There's biters out here, lady.
- Let us out.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.400
Get back!

19:56.571 --> 19:59.563
- ( shouting continues)
- I told you to get back.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.775
- Nobody leaves.
- Hey, Martinez, we got biters.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.693
All right,
take them out.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.955
( gunshots)

20:12.170 --> 20:13.956
- Everybody calm down.
- We can't stay here anymore.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.166
This place is crazy.
Please, you have to let us go.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.252
Karen, you don't want to go out there.
It's too dangerous.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.963
- Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.
- Karen: Please!

20:21.137 --> 20:24.925
(horns honking)

20:25.100 --> 20:26.761
- Hey!
- Hey, knock off the horn.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.267
- Knock off that horn.
- Martinez!

20:29.437 --> 20:31.769
- Get out of the car.
- Put the gun down.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.431
- Get out of the car.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.145
Don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.150
Hey, I don't take
orders from you.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.812
These people are scared.
Shoving a gun in their face won't help.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.855
- Where's the Governor?
- He's--

20:43.034 --> 20:45.741
- There's a riot out here.
- You're making things worse.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.745
- I am?
-( people screaming )

20:48.915 --> 20:52.078
- Andrea: What the hell?
- Martinez: Move!

20:55.505 --> 20:58.292
(snarling )

20:58.466 --> 20:59.797
Get back, get back!

20:59.968 --> 21:01.674
(groaning)

21:01.845 --> 21:04.552
( gunshots)

21:04.722 --> 21:06.804
( clicking )

21:17.110 --> 21:20.102
(groaning)

21:24.617 --> 21:26.482
Oh, my God.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.322
Help him.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.908
Somebody, please?

21:31.082 --> 21:33.869
(groaning)

21:34.043 --> 21:35.624
Help.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.881
Karen:
Do something.

21:59.694 --> 22:02.151
( door slams)

22:07.869 --> 22:09.860
(birds chirping)

22:13.875 --> 22:16.036
It's so quiet.

22:19.797 --> 22:23.085
It's easy to forget how loud
the world used to be.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.170
( laughs)

22:25.345 --> 22:28.257
| used to complain
about it all the time.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.717
Traffic, construction,

22:30.892 --> 22:34.009
car alarms,
noise pollution.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.143
Oh.

22:38.233 --> 22:41.020
What I wouldn't give
for the sweet sound

22:41.194 --> 22:43.185
ofajumbo jet.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.531
It'd be even sweeter
if we were all on it.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.416
Your mom
was proud of you.

23:02.090 --> 23:05.253
For what?
Being mean to her?

23:05.426 --> 23:09.010
No, you can't
think about that.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.593
It's all I think about.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.723
(car approaching )

23:14.894 --> 23:16.634
Please be them.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.557
lt's them. Hurry.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.453
- Drive 'em up. I'll meet you there.
- Maggie: Okay.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.784
Thank God.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.374
- Where's Hershel?
- He's in the cell block.

23:44.549 --> 23:47.291
Carol:
Where's Daryl?

23:47.468 --> 23:49.800
It's all right.
He's alive.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.638
We ran into his brother.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.304
They went off.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.347
He left?

24:06.863 --> 24:09.980
Daryl left?

24:10.158 --> 24:11.989
He's gone?

24:13.995 --> 24:16.327
Is he coming back?

24:24.589 --> 24:26.875
- Hey.
- Gone?

24:28.343 --> 24:30.334
And Oscar?

24:32.180 --> 24:34.171
No.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.742
- ( door opens)
- ( footsteps approaching )

25:05.463 --> 25:06.999
What the hell was that?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.789
You put a round in a man's head
in front of all those people

25:09.967 --> 25:11.878
and just take off?

25:12.053 --> 25:14.465
- You have to talk to them.
- Why?

25:14.639 --> 25:15.924
They're panicking.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.930
They were ready to charge
through those gates.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.841
So let 'em.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.893
Those people
won't last a day.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.770
Those people
have had it easy.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.353
Barbecues and picnics.
That ends now.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.768
Don't blame them for
the mess that you created.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.436
They're scared.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.570
Well, I'm through
holding their hands.

25:33.741 --> 25:37.029
We're at war.
I should have seen that.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.987
So why was Daryl here?

25:41.165 --> 25:44.077
Was he part of the assault?

25:44.252 --> 25:46.459
Why?
Why would he do that?

25:46.629 --> 25:48.415
He came for his friends.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.545
The other people you know.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.628
Glenn and Maggie.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.918
Merle scooped them up
on the run.

25:55.096 --> 25:58.554
Was holding them to find out
where his brother was.

26:00.601 --> 26:03.934
My-- my friends are still alive
and we're shooting at each other?

26:04.105 --> 26:05.436
You're trying
to execute them?

26:05.606 --> 26:07.642
Your friends killed
six good people.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.933
Crowley, Tim, Gargulio,

26:10.111 --> 26:12.227
Eisenberg, Bob Adams.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.111
Haley.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.069
That man out there,
Rich Foster, he makes seven.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.610
So that's what
your friends did.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.330
Why didn't you
tell me they were here?

26:24.500 --> 26:27.082
You kept that from me
while we were...

26:30.631 --> 26:33.168
You're just a visitor here.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.469
Just passing through.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.127
So why should ltell you?

26:42.310 --> 26:45.017
Don't do that.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.930
Don't drive me out.
Not now.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.517
- ( knocks )
- What is it?

26:49.692 --> 26:52.149
The whole town
is out on the street.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.185
It could get ugly again.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.126
Take your sister inside.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.137
Go on.

27:29.607 --> 27:33.520
You came through,
like always.

27:35.029 --> 27:37.566
Sounds like we have
a new problem on our hands.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.901
- Yeah.
- You get a good look at him?

27:42.495 --> 27:46.033
He had Daryl and Merle
pitted against each other.

27:46.207 --> 27:50.041
A crowd cheering for them
to fight to the death.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.874
What kind of a sick mind
does that?

27:54.048 --> 27:56.881
The kind this world creates.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.215
What's wrong?
Is it the baby?

28:02.390 --> 28:04.346
No, the baby,
she's healthy.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.725
Eats like a horse,
sleeps like a rock.

28:20.783 --> 28:24.776
( door opens, closes)

28:44.432 --> 28:47.048
Not exactly
a chatterbox, is he?

28:47.226 --> 28:48.966
Be patient.

28:49.145 --> 28:52.262
When he's ready,
let me do the talking.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.613
She kind of has
Lori's eyes.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.821
Don't you think?

29:06.996 --> 29:09.783
(crying)

29:21.594 --> 29:24.586
(crying continues)

29:37.693 --> 29:39.684
( clamoring )

29:44.825 --> 29:46.816
Milton:
Everyone, if I could--

29:46.994 --> 29:48.655
if I could have
your attention.

29:48.829 --> 29:52.037
- Everyone.
- All right, everybody shut up!

29:52.208 --> 29:54.164
Thank you.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.496
The biters on the perimeter
have been dispatched.

29:56.671 --> 29:59.538
- The fences have been repaired.
- For now.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.922
- Where's the Governor?
- ( crowd murmuring)

30:02.093 --> 30:04.835
His-- his condition is...

30:05.012 --> 30:06.343
unsteady.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.004
The wound he suffered--

30:08.182 --> 30:10.673
- Our friends were killed, man.
- He shot Richard.

30:10.851 --> 30:14.343
I mean, we've all suffered.
We want answers.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.763
( all shouting )

30:16.941 --> 30:19.899
You're right, Karen.
You're right.

30:20.069 --> 30:23.186
Every one of us
has suffered.

30:23.364 --> 30:26.527
We don't even have
funerals anymore because

30:26.701 --> 30:29.192
the death never stops.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.488
We're never gonna
be the same.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.531
Even

30:37.378 --> 30:40.211
So what do we do?

30:40.381 --> 30:45.250
We dig deep and we find
the strength to carry on.

30:45.428 --> 30:47.919
We work together
and we rebuild.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.429
Not just the fences,

30:50.599 --> 30:53.727
the gates,
the community,

30:53.894 --> 30:56.271
but ourselves.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.395
Our hearts, our minds.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.023
And years from now,
when they write about this plague

31:01.193 --> 31:02.729
in the history books,

31:02.903 --> 31:04.564
they will write
about Woodbury.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.525
- Yeah, they will.
- Woodbury.

31:06.699 --> 31:09.691
- We persevered.
- ( all agreeing)

31:13.706 --> 31:16.869
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.638
(Judith fussing )

31:33.809 --> 31:36.721
You've got
a knack for that.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.558
Just trying
to do my part.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.724
Sophia used to wake
the neighbors.

31:42.902 --> 31:45.769
3:00 am.
Like clockwork.

31:47.782 --> 31:51.491
Ed stayed at a friend's most
nights till she calmed down.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.618
| always wanted a child.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.458
She wouldn't have made it
if Daryl hadn't been here.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.466
He couldn't stand
to lose anyone else.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.797
Sounds like him.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.300
I don't see why
he had to leave.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.466
Merle sounds like a jerk.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.971
Men like Merle
get into your head.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.350
Make you feel like
you deserve the abuse.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.937
Even for Daryl?

32:31.784 --> 32:34.275
l'm hardly the woman
I was a year ago,

32:34.453 --> 32:36.159
but if Ed walked through
that door right now

32:36.330 --> 32:37.991
breathing and told me
to go with him,

32:38.165 --> 32:40.542
I'd like to think
I'd tell him to go to hell.

32:43.337 --> 32:45.202
You would.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.290
It doesn't matter.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.674
We're weak without him.

32:54.849 --> 32:57.340
We'll get through
this, too.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.223
Tyreese and his friends
seem capable.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.980
l'm pissed at him
for leaving.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.517
Don't be.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.653
Daryl has his code.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.155
This world needs
men like that.

33:15.744 --> 33:19.032
- ( Judith crying)
- ( chuckles)

33:19.206 --> 33:22.573
Oh. Hello.

33:26.255 --> 33:28.211
- There.
- She fits perfect.

33:28.382 --> 33:29.713
Yeah.

33:29.884 --> 33:31.875
Wait.
You cozy in there?

33:32.052 --> 33:33.508
Yes.

33:40.394 --> 33:43.431
You got worked over good.

33:43.606 --> 33:46.723
Surprised no bones
were broken.

33:46.901 --> 33:49.358
It's courtesy
of Daryl's brother.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.253
You two all right?

34:14.929 --> 34:18.046
Thanks for looking
out for her.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.465
If anything...

34:23.062 --> 34:26.896
I'll go check on her.
You need something else?

34:28.776 --> 34:30.937
Okay.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.908
Same thing goes for you.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.821
If anything worse than this
had happened to you...

34:47.127 --> 34:49.618
You're like
my own son, Glenn.

35:04.812 --> 35:07.349
You got something
needs looking at?

35:09.149 --> 35:11.105
ls Glenn all right?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.611
Go see.

35:34.425 --> 35:37.542
You two seem to be
holding something back.

35:39.847 --> 35:42.509
You want to tell me
what happened?

35:50.524 --> 35:53.982
I rest easy knowing
you can handle yourself.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.570
You've got
your mother's spirit.

35:58.741 --> 36:01.574
And her stubbornness.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.240
You hungry?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.577
No.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.419
Hey.

36:21.555 --> 36:24.046
Don't disappear on me.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.117
She's out like a light.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.253
Must be days
since she slept.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.584
You look pretty shot yourself.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.593
How long before
she can travel?

37:03.764 --> 37:05.095
Have to keep
an eye on her.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.927
Pretty sure she has
a concussion.

37:08.102 --> 37:10.764
Couple of days
if she's up.

37:20.656 --> 37:23.398
Whenever Tomas went off,

37:23.575 --> 37:26.738
Oscar always stood up
for me, you know?

37:28.622 --> 37:30.613
He was my friend.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.282
He went out fighting.

37:34.837 --> 37:37.544
So what now?

37:37.714 --> 37:39.966
You think the Governor
will retaliate?

37:40.134 --> 37:42.295
- Maggie: Yes.
- Glenn: Let him try.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.084
Sounds like he's got
a whole town.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.128
We're outnumbered
and outgunned.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.467
We could use
some reinforcements.

38:02.656 --> 38:05.147
( door opens)

38:15.669 --> 38:18.126
l'm Tyreese.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.292
Sasha, Allen, Ben.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.509
How'd you get in?

38:29.683 --> 38:32.345
Fire damage to the administrative
part of the prison.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.055
Wall's down.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.515
That side's completely
overrun with walkers.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.055
How'd you get this far?

38:38.233 --> 38:41.475
We didn't.
We lost our friend Donna.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.518
Carl:
They were lost in the tombs.

38:43.697 --> 38:46.564
- You brought them here?
- Hershel: He had no choice.

38:51.038 --> 38:53.074
I'm sorry
about your friend.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.534
We know what that's like.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.700
Hershel said you could
use some extra hands.

38:57.878 --> 39:00.164
We're no stranger
to hard work.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.206
We'll go out and get our own food,
stay out of your hair.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.874
You got a problem with another group,
we'll help with that, too.

39:06.053 --> 39:08.715
Anything to contribute.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.180
No.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.891
Sasha:
Please.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.021
It's like "10 Little lndians"
out there.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.558
It's just us now.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.148
No.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.234
Hershel:
Let's talk about this.

39:28.408 --> 39:31.571
- We can't just keep--
- We've been through this.

39:31.745 --> 39:35.237
With Tomas, Andrew.
Look what happened.

39:35.415 --> 39:39.078
- Axel and Oscar weren't like them.
- And where's Oscar now?

39:47.469 --> 39:49.926
I can't be responsible.

39:50.097 --> 39:53.760
You turn us out,
you are responsible.

39:53.934 --> 39:56.050
Hershel: Rick.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.393
You've done
so much for us.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.184
I appreciate that.
We all do.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.444
We owe you our lives.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.447
We've done
everything you asked

40:10.617 --> 40:13.074
without question.

40:13.245 --> 40:17.363
And I'm telling you
you're wrong on this.

40:17.541 --> 40:21.033
You've got to start
giving people a chance.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.727
(sighs)

40:47.904 --> 40:49.986
Yeah.

41:04.421 --> 41:07.288
No, no.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.422
No, no, no, no.

41:11.928 --> 41:14.670
No.

41:14.848 --> 41:17.385
No, no, no,
no, no.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.436
Why are you here?

41:23.607 --> 41:26.064
- What do you want from me?
- Dad?

41:26.234 --> 41:29.362
Why are you-- no.

41:35.744 --> 41:38.281
I can't help you.
Get out!

41:38.455 --> 41:40.741
- Tyreese: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get-- get out!

41:40.916 --> 41:42.998
Tyreese: Hey, come on.
Whoa, it's all good.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.033
Sasha:
What are you doing?

41:45.212 --> 41:46.873
Hey, easy, Rick.
There's no need to--

41:47.047 --> 41:49.709
You don't belong here!
Get out! Please!

41:49.883 --> 41:51.589
- Relax, brother. Relax.
- Get out! Get out!

41:51.760 --> 41:53.625
Tyreese: We'll leave.
We're going.

41:53.804 --> 41:55.465
Okay? Ain't nobody
got to get shot here.

41:55.639 --> 41:57.550
- We're going.
- What are you doing here?!

41:57.724 --> 42:00.716
- Okay, we're going.
- Just go! Go! Go!

42:00.894 --> 42:02.475
Come on, come on.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.157
