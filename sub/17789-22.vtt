it's too hot outside.

Oh!
That's not really necessary.

Good point.

Question two --
Oh, we don't have time for this.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.505
I'm gonna do it myself.
What?

10:05.538 --> 10:07.741
No, you can't!
You're only one IQ point away

10:07.775 --> 10:09.042

Okay, Watterson,
I've marked your test,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.421
and I've got some bad news.

Must have been all the time
we spent going over it.

Wait, so you actually --

10:33.400 --> 10:35.602
Yes, I actually learned
something.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.305
And a pleasure to keep you
with us, too, Miss Simian.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.007
Ah.
Good job, Watterson.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.510

Ha.
Yeah, it really helped.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.416
It meant I could focus
and didn't need to cheat
