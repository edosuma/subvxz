- If I was her,

13:37.275 --> 13:38.448
I'd wanna know everything
about the woman around my kid.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.241
Especially if she's
about to become

13:41.241 --> 13:42.931
the biggest star in the world.

13:42.931 --> 13:45.310
[tense music]

14:00.586 --> 14:01.448
- Mama.

14:06.000 --> 14:06.448
What are you doing
in dad's room?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.310
- I was looking
for the restroom.

14:10.413 --> 14:11.586
- Oh, okay.

14:11.586 --> 14:12.275
Come on, let's go.

14:14.655 --> 14:17.000
- You know,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.172
I just want Deidra to respect
me and the way I care for Jay,

14:20.172 --> 14:21.413
like I respect her.

14:21.413 --> 14:24.448
Besides, I wanna have
kids of my own one day.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.620
- Well, if she keeps
disrespecting my sister,

14:26.620 --> 14:29.517
I will show her how
real of a sister I am.

14:29.517 --> 14:30.965
- Ooh.

14:30.965 --> 14:32.448
- I'll stomp a hole
in her real quick.

14:32.448 --> 14:33.620
- What?

14:33.620 --> 14:35.448
- I'll knock her teeth out.
Don't get me started. Uhn-uh

14:37.413 --> 14:38.275
- T.

14:42.448 --> 14:46.586
- Uh, okay, so look,
I told Jay that I,

14:48.000 --> 14:48.620
I could have stayed in the car.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.413
If I overstepped.

14:49.413 --> 14:50.344
- Oh no, please, Deidre.

14:50.344 --> 14:51.448
Don't be silly, we're-

14:52.620 --> 14:54.000
- Thank you for allowing me

14:54.000 --> 14:55.275
to take my child
for the weekend.

14:57.413 --> 14:58.310
Um, you know what?

14:59.448 --> 15:02.034
I wanna apologize
about the other day.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.965
I'm truly grateful

15:04.965 --> 15:06.517
for everything that
you've done for my child.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.655
Is there any way that we
could just, I don't know.

15:12.482 --> 15:13.448
Can we start over?

15:16.310 --> 15:17.172
- I'd like that.

15:18.172 --> 15:19.655
- Cool, how about tonight?

15:21.344 --> 15:22.551
- Tonight?

15:22.551 --> 15:23.482
Um...

15:25.724 --> 15:26.482
- Yeah, my liquor cabinet,
it stays open pretty late.

15:28.413 --> 15:29.655
- Tonight may not
work, only because-

15:31.379 --> 15:32.551
- Oh, I get it, that's right.

15:32.551 --> 15:34.482
You probably have a bunch
of text messages to read.

15:34.482 --> 15:35.586
It's okay, it's cool.

15:37.034 --> 15:38.103
Come on baby, let's go.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.689
- Wait.
[ominous music]

15:40.689 --> 15:42.655
How late does your
liquor cabinet stay open?

15:44.482 --> 15:46.655
[tense music]

16:12.206 --> 16:13.275
- It's not much,

16:15.103 --> 16:16.517
but um, Jay has his own room

16:18.068 --> 16:19.344
and it's in a good
school district.

16:21.758 --> 16:23.241
- Um, I think it's great.

16:27.068 --> 16:28.275
- Let's do this.

16:30.379 --> 16:33.068
- Let's.

16:33.068 --> 16:34.758
- So how did you meet Charles?

16:34.758 --> 16:35.724
- Uh, my sister, Pam.

16:35.724 --> 16:36.655
- Pam.

16:37.724 --> 16:39.793
Cute.

16:39.793 --> 16:42.275
- Yeah, it's actually
a really funny story.

16:42.275 --> 16:42.620
So they were-
- A toast.

16:45.241 --> 16:45.724
- Okay.

16:47.379 --> 16:49.068
What are we toasting to?

16:49.068 --> 16:50.448
- You, silly.

16:51.413 --> 16:53.724
Your song, it's amazing.

16:55.655 --> 16:57.275
It's the prettiest song
that I've ever heard.

16:58.379 --> 16:59.241
- Thank you, Deidra.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.344
- I almost feel like I
have a connection to it.

17:03.482 --> 17:05.482
- Hmm.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.827
No, it's funny you say that

17:06.827 --> 17:09.620
because I felt the same
exact way when I heard it.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.137
- You heard it?

17:11.137 --> 17:12.620
- Yeah, the demo.

17:12.620 --> 17:15.172
Charles had written
it years ago,

17:15.172 --> 17:16.517
and when I heard this song,

17:18.344 --> 17:19.655
I just knew I had to sing it.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.206
- So he never released it?

17:23.206 --> 17:26.068
- Uh-uh, he said he could never
find the right voice for it,

17:26.068 --> 17:26.551
till now.

17:30.137 --> 17:32.344
- What exactly did
Charles tell you about me?

17:34.241 --> 17:36.344
- What does anybody ever
tell anyone about their ex?

17:36.344 --> 17:38.172
- Fair enough.
- Mm.

17:38.172 --> 17:40.172
[both chuckling]

17:40.172 --> 17:44.655
- Well, we met when I was
in my second year in college

17:44.655 --> 17:47.448
and he had just had
this serious breakup

17:47.448 --> 17:50.517
with Jessica Dawson.

17:52.482 --> 17:53.482
- Jessica Dawson.

17:55.655 --> 17:58.241
- By that look, you've
heard that name before.

17:59.655 --> 18:00.896
She really broke his heart.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.586
But her loss was my gain, right?

18:04.241 --> 18:07.310
And I was in school
for computer graphics,

18:07.310 --> 18:08.586
but he saw right through.

18:09.275 --> 18:10.689
He knew I wanted to make music.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.206
- So you sing.

18:12.206 --> 18:12.758
- Dabbled.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.551
You know Charles, he makes
you feel like a star.

18:18.551 --> 18:20.620
- Mm.

18:20.620 --> 18:24.241
- He used to keep his uh,
his songs in these journals.

18:24.241 --> 18:25.413
- Yeah, he still does that.

18:26.517 --> 18:28.724
- And we would go to the studio

18:28.724 --> 18:33.241
and we would record
these amazing love songs.

18:33.241 --> 18:36.758
But then it led to more love
making than making music.

18:38.862 --> 18:40.620
I think sex inspires him.

18:46.206 --> 18:47.793
And then Jay was born and uh,

18:50.310 --> 18:50.689
there was no more
time for music.

18:52.206 --> 18:53.862
At least that's what he told me.

18:56.517 --> 18:57.689
- So is that why you stopped?

18:59.517 --> 19:00.448
- We both did.

19:02.379 --> 19:05.379
We got married and we tried
to make the family thing work.

19:05.379 --> 19:08.793
He went back to work at a
old manufacturing plant.

19:08.793 --> 19:11.379
I went back to school
and we really tried,

19:11.379 --> 19:15.620
and we were a family,
until we weren't.

19:19.482 --> 19:19.758
He didn't tell you that, did he?

19:20.965 --> 19:21.931
- Uh, no.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.482
- Just that I'm a crazy
mama that abandoned her kid.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.793
- No, Deidre, he never said any-

19:30.793 --> 19:32.793
- I had so much love
for him, for our family,

19:33.689 --> 19:34.758
until he got arrested.

19:36.310 --> 19:37.620
That was the
beginning of the end.

19:39.275 --> 19:39.793
- Arrested?

19:42.310 --> 19:43.655
- I've said too much.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.482
- No, you haven't said enough.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.655
What was he arrested for?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.620
- Whatever happened
with us is in the past.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.931
He's with you now.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.793
- Yeah, but he never
told me any of this.

20:00.965 --> 20:03.275
- I'm not gonna start any more
trouble than I already have.

20:03.275 --> 20:04.931
He's found his way
back to his music.

20:06.586 --> 20:07.724
He's happy.

20:09.275 --> 20:09.931
You're happy.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.724
[melancholy music]

20:31.793 --> 20:32.620
And Jay's happy.

20:35.965 --> 20:38.448
I had a lawyer draw those
up and I signed them.

20:40.793 --> 20:42.827
I realized that there was
no upside for a waitress

20:42.827 --> 20:45.793
up against a successful
music producer in court.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.482
Take it.

20:53.655 --> 20:56.793
Besides, a custody
battle is no way to start

20:56.793 --> 20:58.551
a healthy co-parenting
relationship.

21:01.517 --> 21:03.344
- Wow, Deidra.

21:03.344 --> 21:03.793
Thank you.

21:06.655 --> 21:07.689
- This was fun.

21:08.827 --> 21:09.655
- It was.

21:09.655 --> 21:10.517
We should do it again.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.896
- Oh, by tomorrow,
you will be so famous

21:14.896 --> 21:17.034
you won't remember that
cheap wine I served you.

21:17.034 --> 21:19.517
- Oh, from me, your
lips to God's ears.

21:20.827 --> 21:22.517
And that wine was not
that cheap, Deidra.

21:24.482 --> 21:27.379
[dog barking]

21:27.379 --> 21:29.517
- That's just Renegade,
the neighbors dog.

21:30.413 --> 21:31.000
It's, he's harmless.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.655
- He don't sound that harmless.

21:33.655 --> 21:34.689
- You get used to it.

21:36.689 --> 21:38.000
[phone beeping]

21:38.000 --> 21:38.724
Oh.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.724
[Deidra giggling]

21:42.724 --> 21:45.034
- And what has got
you smiling so hard?

21:45.034 --> 21:46.862
- It's not a what, it's a who.

21:48.275 --> 21:49.689
- Oh.

21:49.689 --> 21:50.517
Who?

21:50.517 --> 21:52.344
- Some guy.

21:52.344 --> 21:53.896
He uh, wants me to
send him a naughty pic.

21:55.586 --> 21:56.724
- Ooh, do you like him?

21:56.724 --> 21:58.620
- Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

22:00.413 --> 22:01.344
- Hey, do it, okay?

22:01.344 --> 22:02.517
You only live once.

22:02.517 --> 22:04.413
What, is he cute?

22:04.413 --> 22:05.931
- You'll see him soon enough.

22:07.068 --> 22:07.965
- Okay.

22:09.724 --> 22:11.827
Well um, I should get going,

22:11.827 --> 22:13.931
but I'm really glad we
got the chance to do this.

22:13.931 --> 22:14.758
- Likewise.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.965
- Thank you, Deidra.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.000
- You, uh, tell Charles
to stay outta trouble.

22:24.034 --> 22:26.758
[melancholy music]

22:35.758 --> 22:37.965
[lively music]

22:58.758 --> 22:59.034
- Tammy.

23:00.965 --> 23:02.517
Tammy, why aren't you ready?

23:02.517 --> 23:04.413
We have a meeting with
Satellite Radio at 11 o'clock.

23:04.413 --> 23:05.482
All right, this industry
doesn't give second chances.

23:05.482 --> 23:07.551
We can't blow this.

23:07.551 --> 23:09.896
- You know, that's funny,
because you got a second chance.

23:12.137 --> 23:13.000
- What?

23:15.482 --> 23:17.896
- I went and saw
Deidre last night.

23:17.896 --> 23:18.758
- Why would you do that?

23:19.551 --> 23:21.068
- You know, probably
for the same reason

23:21.068 --> 23:22.034
you never told me why
you were arrested.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.103
- Look, baby.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.965
- Look, do not "baby" me.

23:28.862 --> 23:29.724
What the hell?

23:30.965 --> 23:32.482
- Look, it's the
past, all right?

23:32.482 --> 23:33.517
She's the past.

23:33.517 --> 23:35.034
All right, let it go.

23:35.034 --> 23:36.965
- Why didn't you tell
me that she sings,

23:36.965 --> 23:38.896
or anything about
her for that matter?

23:39.896 --> 23:40.758
Or should I let that go, too?

23:42.551 --> 23:42.896
What else are you
hiding from me, Charles?

23:44.620 --> 23:44.896
- It's not what you think.

23:47.724 --> 23:48.793
Look, I did it for Jay.

23:48.793 --> 23:53.034
Okay, I kept secrets for him.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.000
All right, look.

24:01.655 --> 24:03.551
I was arrested for assault.

24:03.551 --> 24:05.586
All right, some
guy said I hit him

24:05.586 --> 24:06.724
after I saw him and
Deidra flirting.

24:09.034 --> 24:10.241
I got jealous and
confronted him.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.103
- And did you hit him?

24:12.103 --> 24:13.896
- No, no, but the police
didn't believe me.

24:14.862 --> 24:16.551
I was a hothead back then

24:16.551 --> 24:18.827
and it wasn't the first time
I was in trouble with the law.

24:20.034 --> 24:20.965
- Not your first time?

24:22.862 --> 24:25.172
- Look, our
relationship was toxic.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.103
She reveled in the drama.

24:27.931 --> 24:31.000
- Yeah, but why
didn't you tell me?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.586
- Well, I had my
record expunged.

24:33.586 --> 24:35.034
Right, I paid a PR
team to erase me

24:35.034 --> 24:37.482
and Deidra's internet history

24:37.758 --> 24:38.965
because I didn't
want Jay to know

24:38.965 --> 24:41.000
he had a father
that was a criminal

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
and a mother who went to a
mental health institution.

24:45.896 --> 24:48.206
Oh.

24:48.206 --> 24:49.965
I bet she left
that part out, too.

24:53.103 --> 24:54.793
- Well, did she sing?

24:56.724 --> 24:58.000
- Did she sing?

24:59.068 --> 24:59.965
Yeah, a little.

25:01.275 --> 25:03.965
But she wasn't a star.

25:03.965 --> 25:05.172
Not like you.

25:05.172 --> 25:06.724
- Charles, I am your wife.

25:06.724 --> 25:09.034
Do you know how stupid I felt?

25:09.034 --> 25:10.000
It's like I don't even know you.

25:12.275 --> 25:13.620
- Now you know me.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.862
- So does Deidra and Jessica.

25:18.034 --> 25:20.551
- Look, I know I betrayed
your trust in the past,

25:20.551 --> 25:24.137
and I know I don't deserve
it, but I'm asking you,

25:24.137 --> 25:25.034
look Tammy, you're
raising my son.

25:26.689 --> 25:28.862
Hell, I won't pretend that
I can do this without you.

25:32.655 --> 25:33.793
No more secrets, Tammy.

25:35.655 --> 25:36.103
Okay, I promise.

25:48.103 --> 25:49.965
- Deidra's not seeking
full custody anymore.

25:51.655 --> 25:52.000
She's okay with co-parenting.

25:54.793 --> 25:56.172
- Well, well how?

25:56.172 --> 25:57.793
I mean.

25:57.793 --> 25:59.137
- Does it matter?

25:59.137 --> 25:59.896
It's done.

26:03.241 --> 26:04.620
Hey, I mean, I don't
know what to say.

26:04.620 --> 26:06.034
I mean, I'm just-

26:06.034 --> 26:06.896
- You know what, Charles, just,

26:08.724 --> 26:10.965
promise me you'll be honest
with me from here on out.

28:25.344 --> 28:26.758

28:26.758 --> 28:28.758
- Charles' file is sealed,

28:28.758 --> 28:30.000
but the other guy's file isn't.

more assault charges

- How will this help
me get to the truth?

28:41.517 --> 28:43.000
- Charles didn't do it.

28:44.310 --> 28:45.379
- He didn't?

28:45.379 --> 28:46.931
- Page six, superstar.

28:53.068 --> 28:55.379
- What is this I'm looking at?

28:55.379 --> 28:56.310
- It's a transcript
from a criminal case

28:56.310 --> 28:57.931
where Jimmy was a
state star witness.

29:00.137 --> 29:02.275
The defense attorney
raised concerns

29:02.275 --> 29:03.310

as a witness.

He cites Charles's
case as his reason.

only to drop his claim

29:15.689 --> 29:18.517
after his allegations
could not be corroborated.

29:20.034 --> 29:21.034
Why would he do that?

29:22.827 --> 29:24.137
- Why does any man do
what he does for a woman?

29:33.896 --> 29:35.586

have to do, but thank you.

vibrant, and have her-

and I don't wanna fight.

a key to your dad's house.

enough to have a key to mine.

You have two houses now.

I can't stand to be in this
house around you anymore.

talk about your past

know where we live.

gonna be okay.

41:23.586 --> 41:24.551

husband is famous.

41:37.586 --> 41:38.931
And with the hit new song,

41:40.241 --> 41:42.758
all his ex's will probably
come out of the woodwork.

41:42.758 --> 41:45.068
- Well, he needs to
get ahead of that.

41:45.068 --> 41:46.551
It is not my job
to manage his past.

57:38.103 --> 57:40.896
And you're right about Tammy.

57:40.896 --> 57:42.034
She didn't kill anyone.

57:44.517 --> 57:47.896
What you saw in the room was
me trying to help the police.

57:50.034 --> 57:51.724
They asked me to help.

57:53.103 --> 57:54.793
I know this is scary,

57:56.103 --> 57:58.655
but I was just doing
my part trying to help.

58:02.068 --> 58:03.000
I'm sorry.

58:05.172 --> 58:07.172
They said somebody might
be trying to hurt me, too.

58:09.896 --> 58:11.620
- I will never let
anything happen to you.

58:13.103 --> 58:13.793
I'll protect you.

58:19.620 --> 58:20.862
- That's my baby.

58:27.310 --> 58:28.655
- Now what do we do?

58:30.862 --> 58:32.793
- We stick together.

58:32.793 --> 58:34.034
You and me.

58:40.758 --> 58:43.724
[people chattering]

58:45.896 --> 58:47.724
- They've been out
there all night.

58:47.724 --> 58:48.965
- [Pam] I'm working on that.

58:48.965 --> 58:50.862
I'll get the media to back off.

58:50.862 --> 58:53.034
- It's just, I know
Deidre's behind this.

58:53.034 --> 58:55.206
- [Pam] Anybody with
eyes can see that,

58:55.206 --> 58:59.034
but me having a law agree is
advising you to see what I see.

58:59.034 --> 59:01.241
- And what is that?

59:01.241 --> 59:03.034
- The police will subpoena
Deidre's internet provider

59:03.034 --> 59:05.137
for her IP address's activity.

59:05.137 --> 59:06.827
It'll be all over soon.

59:06.827 --> 59:07.689
She's done.

59:09.034 --> 59:09.965
- It doesn't feel that way.

59:11.931 --> 59:14.931
I need a favor,
from Detective Pam.

59:18.241 --> 59:20.724
- What do you mean Jay
doesn't want to come home?

59:22.310 --> 59:23.000
No, let me talk to him.

59:24.241 --> 59:25.793
I tried calling him all night.

59:25.793 --> 59:26.137
He's not answering his phone.

59:27.896 --> 59:29.000
Just put him on
the phone, Deidre.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.172
What?

59:32.172 --> 59:33.896
I don't need to calm down.

59:33.896 --> 59:35.241
What?

59:35.241 --> 59:37.000
You can't do that.

59:37.000 --> 59:37.862
Hello?

59:38.931 --> 59:40.206
Deidre.

59:40.206 --> 59:41.068
Damn it!

59:50.965 --> 59:51.965
How long you been
standing there?

59:53.137 --> 59:54.137
- Long enough.

59:57.068 --> 59:58.931
Go, you need to see him.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.931
- I'm, I'm not leaving you.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.896
- I am not a porcelain doll.

01:00:04.896 --> 01:00:06.103
Jay needs you, go check on him.

- Where's Jay?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.034
- Excuse me?

01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:35.068
- Where is he?

01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:36.068
We're leaving.

01:00:36.068 --> 01:00:36.931
- Wait, he, wait.

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:37.931
He wants to stay.

01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.000
- I don't have time for this.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.620
Jay, Jay.
- Calm down, calm down.

01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:47.241
Look, I'm not letting you
in here until you calm down.

01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:49.965
We are going to speak as adults.

01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:53.172
That boy is scared
enough as it is already.

01:01:01.137 --> 01:01:02.931
- How did you get these so fast?

01:01:03.517 --> 01:01:05.000
- [Pam] I don't
disclose my techniques.

01:01:06.827 --> 01:01:09.862
- Wow they look so real.

01:01:09.862 --> 01:01:10.586
- It's a deep fake.

01:01:10.586 --> 01:01:11.206
She's crazier than I thought.

01:01:12.448 --> 01:01:14.310
- Yeah, but why?

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:16.241
Charles was open to having
her be in Jay's life.

01:01:16.241 --> 01:01:17.862
I just...

01:01:17.862 --> 01:01:19.448
- [Pam] Something must
have triggered her.

01:01:19.448 --> 01:01:22.241
[tense music]

01:01:24.413 --> 01:01:28.034
- It's the prettiest song
that I've ever heard.

01:01:28.034 --> 01:01:29.689
I feel like I have a,
a connection to it.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.862
- You know what?

01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:36.137
Let me call you back.

01:01:38.413 --> 01:01:40.137
- Are you really gonna
keep me from my son?

01:01:42.275 --> 01:01:43.310
What the hell are
you doing, Deidra?

01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:46.310
- What am I doing?

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.965
Uh, someone was
killed in your house,

01:01:49.965 --> 01:01:51.827
and you really want
him to go back to that?

01:01:51.827 --> 01:01:53.310
- Then we'll leave.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.758
- Oh, okay.

01:01:54.758 --> 01:01:56.000
He'll love that.

01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:00.137
Another move in the
middle of the school year.

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:03.137
- And let me guess, being with
you was the only solution?

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.241
- Last time I checked, no
one died in my living room.

01:02:09.034 --> 01:02:11.137
Jay is a child.

01:02:11.137 --> 01:02:14.827
He needs time to process.

01:02:14.827 --> 01:02:16.896
He's safer here.

01:02:16.896 --> 01:02:18.034
- He's safe with me.

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.172
- That's not good enough for me.

01:02:20.172 --> 01:02:22.379
- Not good enough, for you?

01:02:24.068 --> 01:02:26.206
- I'm doing what's
best for my son.

01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:29.310
- By brainwashing
him against me?

01:02:30.275 --> 01:02:32.206
- Last time I saw your wife,

01:02:32.206 --> 01:02:35.206
she was leaving with a suitcase,

01:02:35.206 --> 01:02:38.137
and the next day
she's killing someone.

01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:40.344
Your house is unstable,

01:02:40.344 --> 01:02:42.241
and it's been like
that for a minute.

01:02:44.482 --> 01:02:49.068
I'd be happy to talk to the
press about my concerns.

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:53.310
- [Charles] Oh, so this
is what it comes down to?

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.758
Okay, let's cut the bullshit.

01:02:57.896 --> 01:02:59.000
What do you want?

01:02:59.896 --> 01:03:03.448
- I want our son safe.

01:03:04.517 --> 01:03:06.310
I'm looking out for him.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:09.034
Someone has to and clearly
Tammy can't do that.

01:03:10.137 --> 01:03:12.000
- This isn't about Tammy.

01:03:13.034 --> 01:03:15.137
This is about you and me.

01:03:19.034 --> 01:03:22.206
- You made it about Tammy
when you gave her our song.

01:03:24.344 --> 01:03:25.241
- Song?

01:03:27.206 --> 01:03:28.827
What, what, what are
you talking about?

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:32.310
You're crazy.

01:03:33.344 --> 01:03:34.827
- And your wife is a killer.

01:03:37.206 --> 01:03:39.310

pick 'em, Charles.

why he has to go?

the demo for "You and I?"

01:05:20.586 --> 01:05:22.103
we played around with the
song in the studio once,

01:05:22.103 --> 01:05:23.517
like 13 years ago.

01:05:23.517 --> 01:05:25.241
It wasn't for a demo, right?

01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:26.586
It was for us.

everything to Deidre.

You know, in her mind,
she thinks that I'm
singing her song.

wrote for her family.

I'm a part of now.

that you would always be
honest with me about your past.
