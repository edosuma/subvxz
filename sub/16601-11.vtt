WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:09.072
He busy?

00:09.074 --> 00:10.307
He's in with Garrett.

00:10.309 --> 00:12.409
Good. He should be
in on this, too.

00:12.411 --> 00:14.878
Sorry to interrupt.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.546
I just learned that
a dozen candidates

00:16.548 --> 00:20.016
in the current class of cadets
cheated on the psych exam.

00:20.018 --> 00:21.685
Who cheats on a psych exam?

00:21.687 --> 00:23.186
These guys.
No, I meant why.

00:23.188 --> 00:24.621
Trying to
find that out.

00:24.623 --> 00:25.955
What's their status now?

00:25.957 --> 00:28.058
They're in the process
of being gone.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.459
You're either gone
or you're not.

00:29.461 --> 00:30.727
Apparently, their recruit
discipline officer

00:30.729 --> 00:34.030
knew about it,
but declined to take action.

00:35.199 --> 00:36.333
It only came to light

00:36.335 --> 00:37.934
when some of the other cadets
learned of it.

00:37.936 --> 00:40.437
There's no right or wrong
answers on a psych evaluation.

00:40.439 --> 00:42.472
Well, the fact
remains they cheated.

00:42.474 --> 00:44.841
They were coached on what
to click-- yes or no.

00:44.843 --> 00:46.676
I'm not seeing what's not
cut-and-dried about this.

00:46.678 --> 00:50.113
The dozen cheaters,
they're all ex-military.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.050
Seven Army, five Marines.

00:54.052 --> 00:56.453
All military?

00:56.455 --> 00:58.154
As far as I know.

00:58.156 --> 01:00.590
So I know it's a tough call,
but there's still only one call.

01:00.592 --> 01:02.092
We're just tossing out
a dozen vets?

01:02.094 --> 01:03.693
Want to know
how that's gonna play?

01:03.695 --> 01:05.628
Nobody's gonna
"just toss" anybody.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.330
There's two vets in this room.

01:07.332 --> 01:08.231
Well, I caution using...

01:08.233 --> 01:10.100
Did somebody change this exam?

01:10.102 --> 01:12.102
It got overhauled,
like, two years ago.

01:12.104 --> 01:15.271
Well, suspend the current exam
as of right now.

01:15.273 --> 01:16.106
Yes, sir.

01:16.130 --> 01:17.775
And what's the RDO
have to say for himself?

01:17.776 --> 01:19.275
Well, Sergeant Vega
said that

01:19.277 --> 01:21.344
if the other applicants
hadn't called it out,

01:21.346 --> 01:22.979
that he would've let it slide.

01:22.981 --> 01:25.448
He said that?

01:25.450 --> 01:26.683
More or less.

01:26.685 --> 01:29.052
Tell him to come up here
and say it to me.

01:29.054 --> 01:30.553
Yes, sir.

01:35.626 --> 01:37.227
Hey.

01:37.229 --> 01:39.195
We need to talk.

01:39.197 --> 01:40.163
Okay.

01:40.165 --> 01:41.498
In private.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.299
What's going on?

01:43.301 --> 01:45.034
So I'm taking Jack
to the dentist,

01:45.036 --> 01:46.870
about to drop him off,
and he nonchalantly

01:46.872 --> 01:48.671
drops this huge bomb.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.607
Okay, wh-what is it?

01:50.609 --> 01:53.276
He's not graduating
from high school? What?

01:53.278 --> 01:55.912
Oh, yeah, he's gonna graduate,
but that's part of the problem.

01:55.914 --> 01:57.380
Okay, well,
what's the problem?

01:57.382 --> 02:01.584
After he graduates,
he wants to join the Marines.

02:03.287 --> 02:06.156
Wow. Well, he never
told me that.

02:06.158 --> 02:07.891
We're on the same side
here, right?

02:07.893 --> 02:09.324
What side is that?

02:09.327 --> 02:10.926
Against him enlisting.

02:10.929 --> 02:14.764
Linda, he's from
three generations of military.

02:14.766 --> 02:16.800
Danny, the world is
so much scarier now.

02:16.802 --> 02:18.835
The kind of wars
that they got to fight...

02:18.837 --> 02:20.270
Yeah, and we can't
shelter him forever.

02:20.272 --> 02:23.573
I am not trying to shelter him.

02:23.575 --> 02:26.042
I'm trying to keep him alive.

02:26.044 --> 02:27.410
Okay, I will talk to him.

02:27.412 --> 02:29.312
About how proud you are
that he's following

02:29.314 --> 02:31.014
in your footsteps?
That's not what I said, Linda.

02:31.016 --> 02:32.382
I will talk to him,

02:32.384 --> 02:35.718
man to man, father to son,
and I'll figure out

02:35.720 --> 02:37.887
where his head is, okay?

02:41.625 --> 02:43.827
You better get
on the right side here, Danny.

02:43.829 --> 02:45.562
Come on.

02:51.536 --> 02:52.902
Get away from my house!

02:52.904 --> 02:54.437
I just want to see him!
Five minutes!

02:54.439 --> 02:55.481
Hey!

02:55.505 --> 02:56.273
Get out of my house
this very second!

02:56.274 --> 02:57.207
Ladies, separate!

02:57.209 --> 02:58.341
Separate!

02:58.343 --> 02:59.309
Hey!

02:59.311 --> 03:01.010
Ladies, separate now!
Hey!

03:01.012 --> 03:02.745
Right now!
Officers, thank you.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.113
I have to see him!

03:04.115 --> 03:06.549
Officers, thank God
for coming. Thank you.

03:06.551 --> 03:08.084
Okay, all right,
who called this in?

03:08.086 --> 03:09.786
I did. I did.
This is my home.

03:09.788 --> 03:11.955
What's your complaint?
She needs to go now.

03:11.957 --> 03:12.755
My son's in there!

03:12.757 --> 03:14.424
He's <i>my</i> son!

03:14.426 --> 03:16.226
They adopted him, okay,
but there's been some changes,

03:16.228 --> 03:17.660
and I just want to see my boy.

03:17.662 --> 03:19.266
Who are you?
Are you the father?

03:19.290 --> 03:19.563
Yeah.

03:19.564 --> 03:21.631
My husband is the father!
This is ridiculous!

03:21.633 --> 03:23.433
They have to go
right now!

03:23.435 --> 03:24.634
Ma'am, let's go inside.
Let's talk.

03:24.636 --> 03:26.069
What is there to talk about?

03:26.071 --> 03:27.637
I'm not leaving
till I see him.

03:27.639 --> 03:30.273
Hey, did you or did you not
give him up for adoption?

03:30.275 --> 03:31.741
Yes, but I...

03:31.743 --> 03:33.610
Well, then, I don't really think
that that's your choice.

03:33.612 --> 03:35.178
How can it not be?

03:35.180 --> 03:37.180
He's my son.
I gave him life.

03:37.182 --> 03:39.549
This is our property.
We want them off of it.

03:39.551 --> 03:40.950
Have they threatened you
in any way?

03:40.952 --> 03:42.852
Not specifically,
but their constant presence

03:42.854 --> 03:44.521
feels a lot like a threat.
Yeah.

03:44.523 --> 03:45.722
Have they said what they wanted?

03:45.724 --> 03:47.257
They have been
hounding us for months.

03:47.259 --> 03:49.993
We-we should have gotten
that restraining order.

03:49.995 --> 03:52.095
I'm not a counselor. Okay, I can
refer you to a family court.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.696
You just can't be here.

03:53.698 --> 03:55.899
I can take you guys both in
for trespassing and harassment.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.300
So you can't stay
out front here.

03:57.302 --> 03:59.369
I'd rather be in jail
than not see my son.

03:59.371 --> 04:00.637
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on.

04:00.639 --> 04:02.672
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, calm down, calm down.

04:02.674 --> 04:04.507
It's okay, it's okay.

04:04.509 --> 04:07.110
They want to see him, and
I just, I can't let that happen.

04:07.112 --> 04:09.012
He's-he's five years old.

04:09.014 --> 04:10.713
He doesn't know
that he is adopted.

04:10.715 --> 04:12.382
Hi!

04:12.384 --> 04:14.417
Hi, sweetie.

04:14.419 --> 04:15.985
Mom?
- Yes.

04:15.987 --> 04:17.954
Listen, I'm gonna be done,
sweetheart, in just a little...

04:17.956 --> 04:18.988
I want Froot Loops!

04:18.990 --> 04:21.724
You want Froot Loops?

04:23.060 --> 04:26.496
Have you asked the birth parents
to stop contacting you?

04:26.498 --> 04:29.299
I have said no
in every way imaginable.

04:29.301 --> 04:33.503
I said Kyle is just a kid,
I don't want to confuse him.

04:33.505 --> 04:35.705
If that is a choice
that he wants to make

04:35.707 --> 04:37.640
when he is older,
then that is his choice.

04:37.642 --> 04:41.544
Until then, it's our choice
and ours alone.

04:41.546 --> 04:42.879
<i>What's your name?</i>

04:42.881 --> 04:44.113
John Redding.
This is my wife Carla.

04:44.115 --> 04:45.181
John, you and Carla

04:45.183 --> 04:47.250
really want me
to have you arrested today?

04:47.252 --> 04:48.318
We just want to see our boy.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.886
Is that such
an impossible thing to ask?

04:49.888 --> 04:52.255
No, but you're going
about it all wrong.

04:52.257 --> 04:55.224
Can you help us do it right?

04:59.296 --> 05:01.364
Text me where
you guys can be reached

05:01.366 --> 05:02.932
to that cell phone number, okay?

05:02.934 --> 05:05.268
But for now,
you got to clear out.

05:05.270 --> 05:06.369
Go.

05:06.371 --> 05:07.503
Yes, sir. Come on. Come on.

05:07.505 --> 05:09.038
We can't just go.
He's a cop.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.740
He said he'd help.

05:46.544 --> 05:47.844
Morning.

05:47.846 --> 05:49.612
Oh, I can do those.
Just leave them.

05:49.614 --> 05:51.247
Oh, no.
Housekeeping's included

05:51.249 --> 05:54.117
here at Ritz Reagan
Hotel and Spa.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.351
Honest, I'll do them.

05:55.353 --> 05:56.552
Last week of break.

05:56.554 --> 05:58.254
Don't remind me.
What are your plans?

05:58.256 --> 06:00.823
I was gonna go meet a couple of
friends from school downtown.

06:00.825 --> 06:02.659
And then dinner with Dad?

06:02.661 --> 06:05.495
Oh, I actually had
plans for tonight.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.130
That are, like,
a month old, Mom.

06:07.132 --> 06:08.898
You said you would go.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.033
I'll go another time.

06:10.035 --> 06:11.601
Why do I have to have dinner
with him tonight?

06:11.603 --> 06:12.969
Because he's your father.

06:12.971 --> 06:15.171
It's not like he won't be
if I miss one dinner.

06:15.173 --> 06:17.373
You made a commitment.
We keep our promises.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.741
End of story.

06:19.743 --> 06:22.011
Love you.

06:22.013 --> 06:24.847
I have
Sergeant Daniel Vega, sir.

06:24.849 --> 06:25.648
Send him in.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.051
And a cadet-- Martin Brown.

06:28.053 --> 06:30.586
The invitation
wasn't for two.

06:30.588 --> 06:32.288
Just the sergeant, then?

06:32.290 --> 06:34.424
Let's have them both.

06:40.131 --> 06:41.264
Sit down.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.834
Commissioner.

06:48.572 --> 06:50.339
Who said to bring
a date, Sergeant?

06:50.341 --> 06:52.575
I thought the commissioner
could put a face

06:52.577 --> 06:54.143
to the recruits.

06:54.145 --> 06:55.545
That's not a choice you make.

06:55.547 --> 06:56.846
Make your case.

06:56.848 --> 07:00.283
20% of police officers in
this country are war veterans.

07:00.285 --> 07:02.885
I know that.

07:02.887 --> 07:04.921
In the '80s, they
almost reached 50%.

07:04.923 --> 07:06.689
Enough with the stats.
Get to the point.

07:06.691 --> 07:09.358
The NYPD psych exam,
as revised in 2014,

07:09.360 --> 07:12.428
is rigged against
military veterans.

07:12.430 --> 07:14.197
Our vet recruits are forced to

07:14.199 --> 07:17.200
bend their answers to get
around the touchy-feely traps

07:17.202 --> 07:18.735
the shrinks baked
into the new exam.

07:18.737 --> 07:20.770
Show me the line between
bending their answers

07:20.772 --> 07:22.171
and flat-out cheating.

07:22.173 --> 07:24.607
A soldier and a civilian
have very different responses

07:24.609 --> 07:26.509
when questioned
about firing a weapon.

07:26.511 --> 07:29.112
The test fails to differentiate
between the two.

07:29.114 --> 07:30.646
I couldn't let
good men get thrown out

07:30.648 --> 07:31.614
because of a rigged exam.

07:31.616 --> 07:34.383
You could have
picked up the phone.

07:35.652 --> 07:38.054
Maybe you can tell me
what the hell's going on,

07:38.056 --> 07:41.624
since your RDO seems
to have lost his way.

07:43.427 --> 07:46.395
Sir, I had to lie on that test.

07:46.397 --> 07:49.265
I have to lie to my wife
when she asks me how's dinner.

07:49.267 --> 07:50.466
This isn't that.

07:51.602 --> 07:53.069
Word got around

07:53.071 --> 07:55.004
that if you answered yes
to questions like,

07:55.006 --> 07:58.107
"Have you ever fired a weapon
to harm another person?"

07:58.109 --> 08:00.910
that you'd be tossed out
for consideration.

08:00.912 --> 08:02.378
So I said that I hadn't.

08:02.380 --> 08:03.513
What branch, Cadet?

08:03.515 --> 08:05.782
Lance Corporal,
United States Marines, sir.

08:05.784 --> 08:09.152
Then the correct answer,
the true answer to that question

08:09.154 --> 08:11.454
would be "You bet your ass."

08:11.456 --> 08:12.822
Yes, sir.

08:12.824 --> 08:14.056
I'm a Marine, too.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.124
I know that, sir.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.993
Then you would know
that I would expect

08:16.995 --> 08:21.264
a fellow Marine to be even more
accountable than the next guy.

08:21.266 --> 08:22.532
Sir, if you could just forget

08:22.534 --> 08:23.933
the word "cheating"
for a minute...

08:23.935 --> 08:25.368
I can't forget the word.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.069
It is the only word for it.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.137
I had no other choice.

08:28.139 --> 08:30.873
Yes, you did,
and you made that choice.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.576
But you were my eyes and ears
on the ground,

08:33.578 --> 08:36.511
and you left me blind and deaf.

08:36.514 --> 08:39.248
Sergeant Gormley will start
working on your reassignment.

08:41.952 --> 08:45.154
And I guess
you are <i>my</i> problem now.

08:47.291 --> 08:52.228
When I have made my decision,
you will be the 101st to know.

08:52.230 --> 08:53.596
Dismissed.

08:53.598 --> 08:54.664
Let's go.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.379
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:10.381 --> 09:12.648
Why not at least
let him meet his mom?

09:12.650 --> 09:14.350
Mrs. Rice said that meeting
his biological parents

09:14.352 --> 09:15.351
would only confuse him.

09:15.353 --> 09:16.853
I mean, the kid is five.

09:16.855 --> 09:19.355
They could pretend
it's his aunt or something.

09:19.357 --> 09:21.958
Lie? The kid's gonna be
confused enough.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.960
I'm not saying they
should move in together

09:23.962 --> 09:25.328
and live happily
ever after,

09:25.330 --> 09:27.697
but it seems like there
should be a compromise.

09:27.699 --> 09:28.965
Not from what I saw.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.766
Biological parents
must have some rights.

09:30.768 --> 09:32.568
But the adoptive parents
took that kid in

09:32.570 --> 09:35.304
and they gave him a life;
they're not the bad guys here.

09:35.306 --> 09:36.472
Who said there's any bad guys?

09:36.474 --> 09:38.774
Do me a favor, speed
dial number six.

09:38.776 --> 09:40.776
Just do it.

09:50.721 --> 09:52.421
Hey, appreciate this.

09:52.423 --> 09:54.123
You got a minute.
I'm late for a hearing.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.191
Hi.
- Hello.

09:55.193 --> 09:56.626
What do you know
about adoption law?

09:56.628 --> 09:58.427
Probably as much
as you do. Why?

09:58.429 --> 10:00.062
A call we responded
to this morning.

10:00.064 --> 10:01.797
Birth parents
want to see their kid,

10:01.799 --> 10:03.132
adoptive parents won't let them.

10:03.134 --> 10:04.700
Here's what I do know
about family law.

10:04.702 --> 10:07.303
You'd have to pay me
a fortune to practice it.

10:07.305 --> 10:08.537
It's an emotional minefield.

10:08.539 --> 10:09.705
Yeah.

10:09.707 --> 10:11.073
Which is what
we walked into.

10:11.075 --> 10:13.075
What does that mean?
How do you walk into it?

10:13.077 --> 10:15.778
Somebody call 911
asking for adoption attorneys

10:15.780 --> 10:17.313
and you two responded?

10:17.315 --> 10:19.916
Birth parents were kind of
camping out on the doorstep.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.417
I know the courts
make new rulings

10:21.419 --> 10:22.685
all the time,
probably dozens since

10:22.687 --> 10:24.687
you or I were in law school.
Yeah, but it's...

10:24.689 --> 10:25.688
Maybe you could just take a look

10:25.690 --> 10:26.856
into the rights
of birth parents?

10:26.858 --> 10:28.557
These two kind of
fell off the turnip truck.

10:28.559 --> 10:29.859
Jamie, I don't practice
family law.

10:29.861 --> 10:31.861
I don't make a habit
of pretending to know things

10:31.863 --> 10:33.296
that I don't.
- I just don't have faith

10:33.298 --> 10:35.364
that these two are
gonna get a fair shot.

10:35.366 --> 10:38.467
Then go to church, say a prayer,
and let the system do its job.

10:38.469 --> 10:39.493
Maybe you could just talk
to them, then.

10:39.517 --> 10:40.337
No.

10:40.338 --> 10:41.737
Steer them to someone who could
help. I know you're late.

10:41.739 --> 10:43.105
I'm gonna get going.
- No, no.

10:43.107 --> 10:45.107
I will give them your cell,
tell them to give you a text.

10:45.109 --> 10:46.175
No, don't do that.

10:46.177 --> 10:47.576
Thank you for
doing this, sis.

10:47.578 --> 10:49.512
I didn't agree
to anything, Jamie!

10:49.514 --> 10:50.980
You're the best!
I love you!

10:50.982 --> 10:52.515
Sorry.

10:55.819 --> 10:57.586
Your mom told me
about your blowout.

10:57.588 --> 10:58.921
She's so dramatic.

10:58.923 --> 11:01.023
I mean, it's a big thing
to kind of spring on her

11:01.025 --> 11:02.391
out of nowhere, don't you think?

11:02.393 --> 11:03.526
Should've talked to you?

11:03.528 --> 11:04.860
If you were smart, you would've.

11:04.862 --> 11:06.562
Whatever.

11:06.564 --> 11:08.397
What...

11:08.399 --> 11:09.966
Thanks.

11:09.968 --> 11:11.067
Thank you.

11:11.069 --> 11:12.969
Look, Jack, I figured
this subject

11:12.971 --> 11:15.104
was gonna come up
one day, eventually.

11:15.106 --> 11:16.472
You did?

11:16.474 --> 11:18.808
Yes. I didn't know if
it'd be cops or Marines,

11:18.810 --> 11:21.677
but I figured one day
you might get the itch.

11:21.679 --> 11:23.412
Are you sure you're ready?

11:23.414 --> 11:25.414
Yes, Dad, I'm ready.
- Okay.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.616
Well, then tell me.
Why do you want to enlist?

11:27.618 --> 11:29.385
Is this an interview?

11:29.387 --> 11:31.387
No, it's not an interview;
it's a dad asking his son

11:31.389 --> 11:33.622
a serious question.
Why do you want to enlist?

11:33.624 --> 11:35.691
It's what our family does.
We serve.

11:35.693 --> 11:37.226
Well, there are lots of
different ways to serve, Jack.

11:37.228 --> 11:39.161
Yeah, and the Marines
is the way to go.

11:39.163 --> 11:41.197
Are you seriously gonna try
and tell me otherwise?

11:41.199 --> 11:43.666
No. Are you seriously telling me
that you are 100%

11:43.668 --> 11:45.534
committed to make this choice?

11:45.536 --> 11:46.635
Is that a trick question?

11:46.637 --> 11:48.838
No, it is not a trick question.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.706
It's a legitimate
question, Jack.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.041
Look at me.

11:52.043 --> 11:54.243
Are you sure you're ready?

11:54.245 --> 11:57.713
Not 100%.

11:57.715 --> 12:01.050
Well, that's
the right answer, Jack.

12:02.786 --> 12:05.855
<i>I can only give you</i>
<i>the facts as I understand them.</i>

12:05.857 --> 12:09.425
Open adoption law is not
a-a blanket for all cases.

12:09.427 --> 12:11.694
It really depends
on what you agreed upon

12:11.696 --> 12:13.629
at the time of adoption.

12:13.631 --> 12:16.165
We weren't in the position
to make any agreements.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.167
Are you saying you were coerced?

12:18.169 --> 12:19.201
Coerced?

12:19.203 --> 12:22.505
Uh, pressured or threatened
in some way.

12:22.507 --> 12:23.639
No.

12:23.641 --> 12:25.274
I signed the papers,

12:25.276 --> 12:27.243
but I swear I didn't
know what I was doing.

12:27.245 --> 12:29.211
What did you think
you were signing, a car loan?

12:29.213 --> 12:30.513
You don't have to be sarcastic.

12:30.515 --> 12:33.082
Excuse me, but I'm speaking
to you as an attorney,

12:33.084 --> 12:35.951
as a favor,
not as a best friend.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.055
What are the, like,
minimum and maximums

12:39.057 --> 12:41.824
on this open adoption law?

12:41.826 --> 12:43.793
On the low end
of open adoption,

12:43.795 --> 12:47.329
it could mean updates
from the adoptive parents.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.132
On the high end, some families
do agree to visitation,

12:50.134 --> 12:51.367
but again,

12:51.369 --> 12:53.469
it depends on if you signed
your rights away

12:53.471 --> 12:55.071
and agreed to no contact.

12:55.073 --> 12:56.472
Carla, we-we <i>did</i> sign.

12:56.474 --> 12:58.140
But we didn't know
what we were signing!

12:58.142 --> 13:00.376
I really think the two of you
should go back

13:00.378 --> 13:04.046
and take a close look at what
you signed, with a good lawyer.

13:06.450 --> 13:08.384
How much do they cost?

13:08.386 --> 13:09.518
Well, like anything,

13:09.520 --> 13:10.986
you get what you pay for,

13:10.988 --> 13:12.888
but none of those
are for free.

13:14.558 --> 13:17.460
I thought there might
be another way.

13:17.462 --> 13:18.727
Like?

13:18.729 --> 13:19.995
Like, it's
a natural born right

13:19.997 --> 13:21.964
for a mom and dad
to see their son.

13:21.966 --> 13:25.201
You gave your son
up for adoption.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.970
The Rices have total control
over what they choose

13:27.972 --> 13:30.873
is right for their son
as long as he's a minor.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.210
Carla, John,

13:34.212 --> 13:37.413
you made this decision.

13:37.415 --> 13:39.915
You must've thought it was
the right one at some point.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.617
And if the Rices

13:41.619 --> 13:44.587
are providing a good life
for your son,

13:44.589 --> 13:47.790
one that you aren't
able to provide,

13:47.792 --> 13:50.192
can you still see it

13:50.194 --> 13:52.695
as a blessing?

14:13.367 --> 14:15.718
<i>He barely passed science,</i>
<i>but he got through.</i>

14:15.719 --> 14:17.052
Sports?

14:17.054 --> 14:19.621
Football, track, lacrosse.

14:20.822 --> 14:22.022
Tennis?

14:22.024 --> 14:22.570
No.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.438
Good. Marines
don't play tennis.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.705
How much you weigh?

14:26.707 --> 14:28.140
150, give or take.

14:28.142 --> 14:30.009
25 pounds
of beer and bratwurst

14:30.011 --> 14:31.510
wouldn't do him
no harm, Danny.

14:31.512 --> 14:34.046
Yeah, gonna have to clear that
with Linda though, Terry.

14:34.048 --> 14:36.348
Hey, you tell me
how that goes over.

14:36.350 --> 14:37.550
Copy that.

14:39.854 --> 14:42.154
Jack.

14:42.156 --> 14:44.557
What pisses you off?

14:44.559 --> 14:46.192
That's easy.

14:46.194 --> 14:48.627
Our enemies. Terrorists.

14:50.397 --> 14:53.632
Piss you off enough
to maybe give up one of these?

14:55.035 --> 14:57.203
Look at it.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.775
I'm sorry.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.844
Why you sorry?

15:04.846 --> 15:06.745
You didn't blow it off.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.385
I'll tell you a secret, Jack.

15:13.387 --> 15:15.354
I don't really miss it
that much.

15:15.356 --> 15:16.255
You don't?

15:16.257 --> 15:18.224
When I was your age,

15:18.226 --> 15:20.326
I had both of them,

15:20.328 --> 15:23.696
I'd just walk myself
into all sorts of dumb trouble.

15:23.698 --> 15:26.599
When I lost it in combat,

15:26.601 --> 15:29.468
I never wasted
another day again.

15:32.439 --> 15:35.074
You know, there's about
three generations of guys

15:35.076 --> 15:36.775
owe their ass to Terry.

15:36.777 --> 15:37.943
Thanks for that, brother.

15:37.945 --> 15:40.145
Thank you for this.

15:42.782 --> 15:45.184
I need to see Ms. Reagan now.
Is she expecting you?

15:45.186 --> 15:46.614
She sure as hell ought to be.

15:46.638 --> 15:47.454
Excuse me, she's in a meeting
right now.

15:47.455 --> 15:48.843
- Sorry, Ms. Reagan.
- What gives you the right?

15:48.844 --> 15:50.290
- She blew right past me.
- Call security.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.857
Excuse me, ma'am, you need
to calm down right now.

15:51.859 --> 15:54.093
How dare you interfere
with my family?

15:54.095 --> 15:55.761
Uh, put the phone down.

15:55.763 --> 15:57.196
Anthony, it's okay.

15:57.198 --> 15:59.298
You must be the adoptive mother.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.934
I am Kyle's mom,
Gwen Rice.

16:01.936 --> 16:03.435
Okay, well,
you may not have noticed,

16:03.437 --> 16:05.137
but this is
the district attorney's office,

16:05.139 --> 16:06.539
not a family law firm.

16:06.541 --> 16:07.873
Unless you're Carla
and John Redding,

16:07.875 --> 16:10.643
in-in which case this is
a free legal aid clinic?

16:10.645 --> 16:11.744
I am not helping them.

16:11.746 --> 16:13.112
You met with them!

16:13.114 --> 16:16.782
I met with them as a favor,
as I seem to be doing for you.

16:16.784 --> 16:18.651
You met with them.
I recommended lawyers.

16:18.653 --> 16:19.885
That is it.

16:19.887 --> 16:21.754
That's not what I was told.

16:21.756 --> 16:23.255
Well, then you were told wrong,
and I'm happy

16:23.257 --> 16:24.690
to recommend
some to you as well.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.160
I am sorry for your troubles,
but I have no stake in this.

16:28.162 --> 16:29.595
You do now.

16:30.830 --> 16:34.166
They filed for custody
this morning.

16:35.502 --> 16:37.937
And I find it
hard to believe

16:37.939 --> 16:39.738
that it's a coincidence
that it happened

16:39.740 --> 16:41.607
the day after they met with you.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.310
On what grounds
are they challenging custody?

16:44.312 --> 16:47.379
My lawyers are meeting
about it now.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.748
And I am just waiting for a call

16:49.750 --> 16:52.418
to... to find out
that everything is okay,

16:52.420 --> 16:56.455
and my phone is not ringing.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.726
Do you want to sit down,
Mrs. Rice?

17:00.728 --> 17:02.895
No, I-I'm...

17:06.433 --> 17:09.768
Ms. Reagan, I...

17:09.770 --> 17:13.238
I cannot lose my son.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.608
Listen to me.

17:15.609 --> 17:19.144
As far as I know, they can't
challenge custody after a year,

17:19.146 --> 17:20.479
and Kyle is five, right?

17:20.481 --> 17:23.115
Yeah. In a couple weeks.

17:23.117 --> 17:27.453
Okay, so given the time frame,
they have no case.

17:27.454 --> 17:29.488
I know. It...

17:29.490 --> 17:32.291
It feels like the most
expensive gamble in the world.

17:32.293 --> 17:33.359
It's not a gamble.

17:33.361 --> 17:34.893
The claim will be thrown out

17:34.895 --> 17:37.396
as long as there's no basis
for a dispute.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.400
Thank you. I... I...

17:41.402 --> 17:43.168
I apologize for

17:43.170 --> 17:44.470
busting in here like this.

17:44.472 --> 17:45.971
I am not at all my-myself

17:45.973 --> 17:49.108
with all of this
that's going on.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.544
Thank you for not having me
thrown out.

17:52.546 --> 17:54.079
Good luck.

17:54.081 --> 17:56.281
Thank you.

17:58.318 --> 17:59.718
In for a penny?

17:59.720 --> 18:01.587
The court would never
have accepted a claim

18:01.589 --> 18:03.622
if there were no grounds
to stand on.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.858
Could you, uh...?
I'm already ahead of you.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.431
Number six
is a follow-up.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.901
"Did you feel remorse for
harming an individual?"

18:15.903 --> 18:17.136
Of course not.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.270
Speaking as an ex-Marine.

18:18.272 --> 18:19.338
Speaking as a Marine.

18:19.340 --> 18:20.873
We were trained
to feel successful

18:20.875 --> 18:22.441
after hitting the target.

18:22.443 --> 18:25.978
It was part and parcel to--
and crucial to-- our training.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.446
So the recruits
<i>were</i> in a tough spot.

18:27.448 --> 18:28.947
Relatively speaking.

18:28.949 --> 18:29.948
Relative to what?

18:29.950 --> 18:32.117
Being under fire
in 120-degree heat

18:32.119 --> 18:34.887
in the middle of the desert
is a tough spot.

18:34.889 --> 18:37.690
Taking a test in
an air-conditioned classroom,

18:37.692 --> 18:39.391
not so much.
- I'm losing track

18:39.393 --> 18:41.627
of who you're playing
devil's advocate for.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.664
What?
You just said something smart.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.933
Would you put that in writing?
Because I'm trying to look

18:47.935 --> 18:49.501
through both lenses,
cop and soldier.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.537
My sight isn't gonna be
that clear on this.

18:51.539 --> 18:53.372
Top cop and ex-soldier.

18:53.374 --> 18:56.108
I'm not being sentimental;
you're never an ex-Marine.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.043
Not if it meant something
to you.

18:58.045 --> 19:00.179
And to me, it meant everything.

19:01.248 --> 19:03.148
This is it
as far as I've been able.

19:03.150 --> 19:05.718
32 active NYPD officers
from the last couple

19:05.720 --> 19:08.887
of graduating classes
were likely coached

19:08.889 --> 19:10.656
- on the psych exam.
- 32?

19:10.658 --> 19:13.192
Split pretty evenly
between Marines

19:13.194 --> 19:14.526
and Army non-coms

19:14.528 --> 19:16.028
and enlistees.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.663
28 male, four female.

19:17.665 --> 19:18.731
Combat vets?

19:18.733 --> 19:20.199
About two-thirds of them
saw action.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.166
What are we looking for?

19:21.168 --> 19:22.501
Patterns.
- Of?

19:22.503 --> 19:25.370
Complaints, incidents,
anything that would answer "no"

19:25.372 --> 19:29.408
to the question "Is he or she
fit to wear the NYPD uniform?"

19:35.849 --> 19:38.050
The Rices filed
for separation

19:38.052 --> 19:40.452
before the adoption
was finalized?

19:40.454 --> 19:42.788
According to public record,
the separation was filed

19:42.790 --> 19:46.358
by Andy Rice
on September the third, 2011.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.860
And the adoption?

19:47.862 --> 19:51.130
Finalized the 12th of
November, the same year.

19:51.132 --> 19:52.397
So that's it.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.767
The Rices didn't update
their case worker...

19:54.769 --> 19:56.869
So they violated
their affidavit.

19:56.871 --> 19:59.438
And if the Reddings found out,

19:59.440 --> 20:01.306
then they've got
a case for custody.

20:01.308 --> 20:03.475
Which they clearly did.

20:05.145 --> 20:06.812
What?

20:06.814 --> 20:08.147
Well, if you're
the Reddings

20:08.149 --> 20:10.616
and you find out
you have a legal claim,

20:10.618 --> 20:13.285
but you don't really trust
the legal system...

20:13.287 --> 20:16.088
You take matters into
your own hands? You think?

20:16.090 --> 20:18.090
I don't know.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.359
Let's just make sure
that Kyle is with the Rices.

20:20.361 --> 20:21.226
What about the Reddings?

20:23.230 --> 20:27.666
I'll put Officer Reagan on it,
since he got us into this mess.

20:27.668 --> 20:30.502
Redding, John and Carla.

20:30.504 --> 20:32.004
Nah, they're gone.

20:32.006 --> 20:32.871
When?

20:32.873 --> 20:33.839
This morning.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.375
They paid Airbnb
till tomorrow.

20:36.377 --> 20:37.776
Seems like a waste of money

20:37.778 --> 20:39.678
to just leave,
but, hey, I'll take it.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.846
Did you see a child with them?

20:40.848 --> 20:42.080
They only paid
for two people.

20:42.082 --> 20:43.415
That wasn't the question.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.050
Did they mention a kid?

20:45.052 --> 20:47.820
I don't pry into
the personal lives of my guests.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.354
Answer, please.
A five-year-old boy

20:49.356 --> 20:50.689
was taken from school
this morning.

20:50.691 --> 20:53.659
That against the law?
Depends on who took him.

20:53.661 --> 20:56.028
Look, officers,
I don't want any trouble.

20:56.030 --> 20:57.196
Hey, come on, man.

20:57.198 --> 20:58.597
Then answer the question.

20:58.599 --> 21:00.232
They mentioned a kid.

21:00.234 --> 21:02.367
They said they were here
to take him home.

21:14.509 --> 21:18.248
No, I didn't encourage him, but
I didn't discourage him either.

21:18.348 --> 21:19.947
So that makes you what?
Switzerland?

21:19.949 --> 21:21.049
No.

21:21.051 --> 21:22.684
Are you really gonna pretend
to be neutral

21:22.686 --> 21:24.585
about your own son
joining the military?

21:24.587 --> 21:26.788
I'm just trying to get him
to look at it from both sides.

21:26.790 --> 21:28.489
That's different.
How?

21:28.491 --> 21:30.091
Because it's his choice.

21:30.093 --> 21:32.327
Don't you get it?

21:32.329 --> 21:35.129
This is his choice.
It's not about you and me.

21:35.131 --> 21:38.433
It's not about making you afraid
and making me proud.

21:43.707 --> 21:44.772
He's our son.

21:44.774 --> 21:46.207
He's not even 18.

21:46.209 --> 21:48.609
Well, he's gonna be 18
soon enough.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.378
He's gonna have to make
real-life choices

21:50.380 --> 21:52.814
that he's gonna have to live
with for the rest of his life,

21:52.816 --> 21:54.816
just like you did and I did.

22:03.026 --> 22:06.060
Hasn't this family
given enough?

22:06.062 --> 22:08.429
Well, I don't know, Linda.

22:08.431 --> 22:11.499
How does one know when
their family's given enough?

22:11.501 --> 22:15.737
Five cops,
four ex-military...

22:15.739 --> 22:17.739
from one family.

22:17.741 --> 22:19.374
I call that enough.

22:19.376 --> 22:21.509
And I call it a legacy.

22:21.511 --> 22:23.111
Danny.

22:23.113 --> 22:25.680
I'm just saying.

22:25.682 --> 22:27.482
Please.

22:47.202 --> 22:48.569
Oh!

22:49.905 --> 22:51.606
Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

22:51.608 --> 22:52.740
I fell asleep.

22:52.742 --> 22:55.376
How was dinner with Dad?

22:55.378 --> 22:57.378
It was nice.

22:57.380 --> 22:59.614
Great. See, it's no big deal.

22:59.616 --> 23:02.049
No, it's not a big deal,
it's just...

23:02.051 --> 23:03.985
it's a lot of family time.

23:03.987 --> 23:06.487
One dinner with Dad?

23:06.489 --> 23:08.423
No, but it's not just
one dinner with my dad.

23:08.425 --> 23:09.791
It's-it's Sunday dinners

23:09.793 --> 23:11.459
and birthdays, holidays.

23:11.461 --> 23:13.161
It's always some something.

23:14.430 --> 23:17.432
Well, that's part of
being a big family.

23:17.434 --> 23:19.100
Sometimes I wish
you could all just imagine

23:19.102 --> 23:20.835
I go to school
in a different city.

23:20.837 --> 23:21.903
But you don't.

23:21.905 --> 23:24.105
Yeah, but imagine I did.

23:24.107 --> 23:26.107
What are you saying?

23:26.109 --> 23:28.543
You don't want to go
to family dinner?

23:30.446 --> 23:33.047
What I'm saying is
I want to make the choice.

23:33.049 --> 23:35.583
I don't want to fulfill
an obligation.

23:39.888 --> 23:41.122
Well, you're right.

23:41.124 --> 23:45.393
It... it should be...
your choice.

23:45.395 --> 23:48.196
Thank you.

23:49.498 --> 23:55.603
You know, family time
can be time-consuming and...

23:55.605 --> 23:59.140
tedious and sometimes annoying.

24:00.476 --> 24:03.077
I mean, one woman's story?

24:03.079 --> 24:07.748
You know, it was...
your dad and me, and-and then...

24:07.750 --> 24:10.551
you, me and Dad, and then...

24:10.553 --> 24:14.555
just you and me, and now
that you're off at school,

24:14.557 --> 24:17.492
it's just me.

24:19.161 --> 24:21.462
And that big...

24:21.464 --> 24:25.266
family with
all those obligations...

24:25.268 --> 24:28.569
to me...

24:28.571 --> 24:31.138
that's money in the bank.

24:41.984 --> 24:44.352
Thank you for giving me
another chance to explain.

24:44.354 --> 24:45.486
You already explained.

24:45.488 --> 24:47.188
That's not why
I asked you up here.

24:47.190 --> 24:49.056
May I put in a word
for Sergeant Vega, sir?

24:49.058 --> 24:51.192
You may.
- He did not cheat, sir,

24:51.194 --> 24:52.627
nor did he encourage us to.

24:52.629 --> 24:55.062
He was just kind enough
to help us along the way.

24:55.064 --> 24:57.965
An accessory to
a violation of the rules

24:57.967 --> 24:59.634
is not an act of kindness.

24:59.636 --> 25:00.835
Yes, sir.

25:00.837 --> 25:02.570
So, you chose the military.

25:02.572 --> 25:05.139
Joined the Marines at 18,
straight out of high school.

25:05.141 --> 25:07.174
Two tours in Iraq
and one in Afghanistan.

25:07.176 --> 25:09.477
As a lance corporal,
what did you see as your duties?

25:09.479 --> 25:12.413
Keep my head up, my eyes open,
and watch out for my brothers.

25:12.415 --> 25:15.416
And stay alive.

25:16.318 --> 25:20.021
That was the desired outcome,
sir, yes.

25:20.023 --> 25:21.756
And when you got out?

25:23.025 --> 25:25.626
I had some skills
and a lot of drive,

25:25.628 --> 25:28.563
and I went out looking
for someplace to use them both.

25:28.565 --> 25:31.365
And you found us.

25:31.367 --> 25:34.835
I grew up in Douglaston, sir.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.003
Didn't take much looking.

25:36.005 --> 25:39.840
Put all that skill and drive
to work back home.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.777
Hoped so.

25:45.515 --> 25:48.449
All good answers.

25:56.292 --> 26:00.261
That exam may have been slanted
against your particulars,

26:00.263 --> 26:02.630
and that was certainly at issue.

26:04.466 --> 26:08.469
But is cheating the way
you and your fellow vets

26:08.471 --> 26:11.005
really want to handle a problem?

26:13.709 --> 26:15.376
You lied on your affidavit,

26:15.378 --> 26:16.744
thereby committing fraud.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.779
I could cuff you right now
or you could start

26:18.781 --> 26:19.847
answering my questions.

26:19.849 --> 26:22.283
I-I swear I don't know
where Kyle is.

26:22.285 --> 26:23.985
Three most likely places?
You know them?

26:23.987 --> 26:25.886
Home, at school...

26:25.888 --> 26:26.854
He's not at either.

26:26.856 --> 26:29.023
I don't know.
- Friends?

26:29.025 --> 26:30.992
Are we missing something?

26:30.994 --> 26:32.994
Did he have a playdate,
a sleepover?

26:32.996 --> 26:34.495
I don't know.

26:34.497 --> 26:36.664
I got to tell you,

26:36.666 --> 26:39.300
there sure is a lot
you don't know about your son.

26:39.302 --> 26:40.868
Adopted son.

26:40.870 --> 26:43.738
I... I'm not very involved
that way.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.773
And what way is that?
As his father.

26:45.775 --> 26:48.142
He was Gwen's idea.

26:48.144 --> 26:49.844
So, you just, what?

26:49.846 --> 26:53.147
You played his dad
for the adoption protocols?

26:53.149 --> 26:54.348
You put it like that...

26:54.350 --> 26:56.317
Hey, I'm not judging.
How would you put it?

26:58.587 --> 27:00.821
I wanted to make it
work for her.

27:00.823 --> 27:02.790
That's why I went over there
the other day

27:02.792 --> 27:04.725
when the Reddings showed up.

27:04.727 --> 27:07.962
I mean, she lives in fear
that something will jeopardize

27:07.964 --> 27:09.397
her custody of Kyle.

27:09.399 --> 27:11.532
But Kyle ended up
jeopardizing your marriage?

27:11.534 --> 27:15.403
I-In the end, having a child
was more important to her.

27:15.405 --> 27:17.538
Where's Gwen from?

27:17.540 --> 27:19.106
Topeka, Kansas.

27:19.108 --> 27:20.875
She still have family there?
Yes.

27:20.877 --> 27:22.877
Would she take the kid there?

27:22.879 --> 27:24.645
Would she flee?

27:29.685 --> 27:31.152
There she is.

27:31.154 --> 27:33.754
Sure you're not
a detective?

27:33.756 --> 27:35.189
Show your badge, please,

27:35.191 --> 27:37.358
and just tell her
I need two seconds.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.727
Passengers for Flight 86...

27:39.729 --> 27:41.662
Excuse me, Mrs. Rice.

27:41.664 --> 27:42.797
Yes?

27:42.799 --> 27:44.765
Can we talk to you
for a sec?

27:47.602 --> 27:49.637
If you want to detain me,
go ahead,

27:49.639 --> 27:52.039
but just please don't make
a scene in front of my son.

27:52.041 --> 27:54.675
I'm not here to detain you
or to make a scene.

27:54.677 --> 27:55.810
Hi, Kyle.

27:55.812 --> 27:58.245
Mom, are we still
going on vacation?

27:58.247 --> 28:00.281
Yes, yes,
just a minute.

28:00.283 --> 28:01.136
Come on, Kyle,
let's play a game.

28:01.160 --> 28:01.817
Nope.

28:01.818 --> 28:03.584
Now, I'm just gonna be
right over here.

28:03.586 --> 28:04.752
I promise you.

28:07.222 --> 28:09.690
I'm here to give
you some facts.

28:09.692 --> 28:12.226
Having Kyle with me
is the only fact that matters.

28:12.228 --> 28:14.161
You're about to kidnap
your own son.

28:14.163 --> 28:16.030
How can I kidnap my own son?

28:16.032 --> 28:18.866
Legal custody is in question;
you're in question.

28:18.868 --> 28:20.835
Now, I understand
the urge to flee...

28:20.837 --> 28:23.671
You couldn't possibly
understand. No one understands.

28:24.873 --> 28:27.708
If you take off with him,
you will be seen

28:27.710 --> 28:28.909
as irresponsible
and reckless.

28:28.911 --> 28:30.044
You'll be giving the Reddings

28:30.046 --> 28:32.079
exactly what they need
for custody.

28:33.515 --> 28:37.885
Now, walk out of here
with me, right now.

28:37.887 --> 28:40.855
Are you gonna report me?

28:40.857 --> 28:43.524
I told you,
that's not why I'm here.

28:44.893 --> 28:47.628
And I will always remember that.

28:52.501 --> 28:54.568
Should I detain her?

28:57.105 --> 28:59.173
No, let her go.

29:09.594 --> 29:12.554
So you agree we need men
and women in our armed forces.

29:12.555 --> 29:13.076
Of course.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.488
And since there is not

29:14.489 --> 29:17.724
a draft currently in effect,
we need men and women who are

29:17.726 --> 29:19.258
ready, willing and
ambitious to serve.

29:19.260 --> 29:21.427
- Pop.
- What?

29:21.429 --> 29:23.563
It's Sunday dinner,
not <i>Face the Nation.</i>

29:23.565 --> 29:25.932
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:25.934 --> 29:26.934
So...

29:27.735 --> 29:29.402
...if not Jack, who?

29:29.404 --> 29:30.670
Who what?

29:30.672 --> 29:32.672
Who serves instead of you
if you don't, Jack?

29:32.674 --> 29:33.606
Danny.

29:33.608 --> 29:35.008
Going back to my foxhole.

29:35.010 --> 29:37.610
I never really bought into that.

29:37.612 --> 29:40.179
It's the million-dollar
question, Erin.

29:40.181 --> 29:41.914
Yeah, with a flaw
in the logic.

29:41.916 --> 29:43.349
Wait, we actually
agree on this?

29:43.351 --> 29:46.452
It assumes all else being equal,
which is hardly ever so.

29:46.454 --> 29:48.821
So the answer to
"If not Jack, who?" could be

29:48.823 --> 29:50.990
the six-foot, four-inch,

29:50.992 --> 29:52.859
long-distance runner
who grew up in Georgia,

29:52.861 --> 29:55.228
hunting game
for his food supply.

29:55.230 --> 29:56.963
That's just confusing the issue.

29:56.965 --> 29:58.631
Confusing the issue
or just you, Pop?

29:58.633 --> 29:59.832
I said "issue."

29:59.834 --> 30:01.467
On the other end,

30:01.469 --> 30:05.171
a troubled kid from a bad home
whose sole purpose of joining

30:05.173 --> 30:08.274
is to use the military
as his ticket out of town.

30:08.276 --> 30:09.876
In which case,

30:09.878 --> 30:11.778
Jack <i>would</i> be
the better choice, right?

30:11.780 --> 30:12.979
Yes. Uh, no?

30:12.981 --> 30:15.381
Yes. Unless the military
gave that kid

30:15.383 --> 30:17.583
some sense of purpose
he didn't know he had.

30:17.585 --> 30:19.886
In which case, no.

30:19.888 --> 30:21.821
And I go back
to my original question:

30:21.823 --> 30:23.356
if not Jack, who?

30:23.358 --> 30:24.390
Well, how about Nicky?

30:24.392 --> 30:25.658
Nicky?

30:25.660 --> 30:26.993
Wh...
It's a free country.

30:26.995 --> 30:28.594
- Lord.
- What, Pop?

30:28.596 --> 30:29.929
You don't think
I'd be valuable?

30:29.931 --> 30:31.164
I didn't say that.

30:31.166 --> 30:34.167
I could see me as either
a reporter for <i>Stars and Stripes</i>

30:34.169 --> 30:36.602
or, like, Demi Moore's character
in <i>A Few Good Men.</i>

30:36.604 --> 30:38.204
There you go.

30:38.206 --> 30:40.306
Why don't you both join up?
That'd be cool.

30:40.308 --> 30:42.075
Yeah. Real cool.

30:42.077 --> 30:44.844
Jack, the fact that you even

30:44.846 --> 30:46.679
considered the Corps
says something.

30:46.681 --> 30:48.881
It means you're thinking about
what I can do

30:48.883 --> 30:52.452
for my country,
not just what I can do for me.

30:52.454 --> 30:54.454
Thank you.

30:54.456 --> 30:57.123
I'll second that.

30:57.125 --> 30:59.759
Me too, Jack.

31:02.329 --> 31:04.464
And at this table,
that will always be

31:04.466 --> 31:07.066
a welcome point of view.

31:11.338 --> 31:13.172
Jamie, could I, uh...

31:13.174 --> 31:15.741
Give me some advice?

31:16.677 --> 31:18.511
I know that look.
Well, not advice, exactly.

31:18.513 --> 31:21.013
More like caution.

31:21.015 --> 31:25.351
I think there's such a
thing as doing too much.

31:25.353 --> 31:27.053
I'm sure there is.

31:27.055 --> 31:29.088
Like responding to
a trespassing beef

31:29.090 --> 31:31.324
and then turning it
into a custody case.

31:31.326 --> 31:33.626
I didn't turn it into a case;
it was one.

31:33.628 --> 31:37.563
<i>Your</i> only case was
the trespassing beef.

31:37.565 --> 31:38.534
Ah.

31:38.558 --> 31:40.033
Now, I'm sure
you meant well,

31:40.034 --> 31:41.767
but I'm not sure
it's professional.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.436
Professional would've been
to just walk away

31:43.438 --> 31:44.637
from the real beef there?

31:44.639 --> 31:46.639
Yeah. I think
there are boundaries.

31:46.641 --> 31:49.275
I know.

31:49.277 --> 31:51.177
You're probably right.

31:51.179 --> 31:53.679
Well, you got me into this,
so I felt like I had

31:53.681 --> 31:55.515
a right to say something.
You do.

31:55.517 --> 31:57.450
But I got this thing.

31:57.452 --> 31:59.919
I'm pretty sure
when it's all said and done,

31:59.921 --> 32:02.321
I'm not gonna be kicking myself
for jumping over some boundaries

32:02.323 --> 32:05.858
when I thought
I could be of help.

32:08.128 --> 32:10.763
But I'm sorry...

32:10.765 --> 32:12.965
if I caused you any trouble.

32:15.302 --> 32:18.104
Just think about it.

32:18.106 --> 32:21.140
I will.

32:21.142 --> 32:23.009
Night, sis.

32:34.321 --> 32:36.556
Very first thing you do
as a Marine, you surrender.

32:36.558 --> 32:38.124
Surrender?
- Yes.

32:38.126 --> 32:39.792
If you come from
where we come from,

32:39.794 --> 32:41.761
that means you surrender to
Parris Island, South Carolina,

32:41.763 --> 32:42.995
for boot camp,

32:42.997 --> 32:45.264
where you surrender
your privacy,

32:45.266 --> 32:46.532
your sleep, your comfort,

32:46.534 --> 32:48.201
and, in many cases,
your dignity.

32:48.203 --> 32:50.403
But that's okay;
it's all part of the plan.

32:50.428 --> 32:51.894
See, they're gonna
take you apart,

32:51.896 --> 32:54.963
gonna open you up, look inside,
see what you got inside,

32:54.965 --> 32:56.432
see what they're working with,

32:56.434 --> 32:58.067
and they're gonna
put you back together again

32:58.069 --> 32:59.301
at the rifle range.

32:59.303 --> 33:00.602
They'll toughen you up.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.271
And don't worry
about your mom, okay?

33:02.273 --> 33:03.706
I got her covered.
- Dad...

33:03.708 --> 33:05.307
I mean, I know
she's difficult...

33:05.309 --> 33:06.266
Dad...

33:06.290 --> 33:07.310
...but she's Mom--
she'll always be Mom.

33:07.311 --> 33:08.544
I'll deal with her.
- Dad!

33:08.546 --> 33:10.245
What?

33:11.381 --> 33:14.550
M-Maybe it's better
if I just go to college.

33:20.523 --> 33:22.391
Wow.

33:22.393 --> 33:24.059
Okay.

33:26.196 --> 33:28.997
A-Are you mad?

33:28.999 --> 33:30.265
No, I'm...

33:30.267 --> 33:33.068
not mad.

33:33.070 --> 33:36.472
I... I guess
I'm just disappointed, Jack.

33:36.474 --> 33:38.807
I'm so sorry.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.175
No, I mean I'm disappointed

33:40.177 --> 33:42.177
that you would ever
in a million years

33:42.179 --> 33:44.847
think that I would be
mad at you about this.

33:46.383 --> 33:48.784
Jack...

33:48.786 --> 33:51.954
the whole point of service
is to make sure

33:51.956 --> 33:54.623
that your people are free
to make the choices

33:54.625 --> 33:57.593
that they want to make
and to do what they want to do

33:57.595 --> 34:00.696
in a way that
they see fit to do it.

34:02.432 --> 34:05.167
And if our family's service
has in small way

34:05.169 --> 34:07.903
afforded you
that luxury, then...

34:07.905 --> 34:10.806
that would make me
a very proud and happy man.

34:10.808 --> 34:12.908
Thanks, Dad.

34:12.909 --> 34:15.610
Thank you.

34:15.612 --> 34:18.246
A lot of ways to serve.

34:18.248 --> 34:21.150
You'll find yours.

34:21.152 --> 34:22.818
Okay?

34:36.733 --> 34:39.400
It's okay. Let her in.

34:39.402 --> 34:41.837
Thank you.

34:41.839 --> 34:43.871
Well, I'm glad to see you.

34:43.873 --> 34:48.310
I-I just, I wanted to thank
you in person, Ms. Reagan.

34:48.312 --> 34:51.045
Gwen, it's Erin.
I think we've earned that.

34:56.418 --> 34:59.721
I wanted a baby, so badly.

34:59.723 --> 35:03.559
I thought it would
give me another...

35:03.561 --> 35:05.794
purpose other than myself.

35:05.796 --> 35:09.298
Well, it's a good thing to want.

35:09.300 --> 35:12.034
I'm...

35:12.036 --> 35:15.270
ashamed.

35:15.272 --> 35:18.273
I was so scared
that they were gonna find out

35:18.275 --> 35:20.476
that we weren't this...

35:20.478 --> 35:23.312
this perfect family
that they left him with.

35:23.314 --> 35:25.514
Okay, Gwen, I get it--
you messed up.

35:25.516 --> 35:28.250
Yeah.

35:28.252 --> 35:30.986
Why'd you get off the plane?

35:30.988 --> 35:33.856
Oh, for Kyle.

35:33.858 --> 35:35.123
Yeah.

35:35.125 --> 35:36.792
You know what that's called?

35:36.794 --> 35:38.126
What?

35:38.128 --> 35:40.662
Fierce maternal instinct.

35:40.664 --> 35:43.532
When push came to shove,

35:43.534 --> 35:45.801
you put his needs
ahead of your own.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.772
Yes, but now
I don't have my boy.

35:50.774 --> 35:53.876
The court is not
gonna forgive you,

35:53.878 --> 35:57.212
but they are not
gonna take him away.

35:57.214 --> 35:58.447
What will they do?

35:58.449 --> 35:59.515
Best-case scenario,

35:59.517 --> 36:01.917
you settle out of court.

36:01.919 --> 36:03.318
Find a compromise.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.088
The good news is,
there's another woman in this

36:06.090 --> 36:08.290
who feels just like you do,

36:08.292 --> 36:10.259
who knows exactly
where you're coming from.

36:10.261 --> 36:11.827
Carla? N-No, no.

36:11.829 --> 36:13.896
She-She's not gonna want
to talk to me.

36:13.898 --> 36:17.933
Try. You'd be surprised what
you can settle across a table.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.342
Wow.

36:29.178 --> 36:31.880
Who are you and what have
you done with my daughter?

36:31.882 --> 36:33.382
Ha-ha.

36:34.617 --> 36:37.119
You really went to town here.

36:41.424 --> 36:45.561
Look,  I was a little cranky
the other day,

36:45.563 --> 36:47.162
I'm sorry.

36:48.631 --> 36:50.098
Seeing my friends

36:50.100 --> 36:51.366
come back in town

36:51.368 --> 36:54.536
and hearing stories about them
seeing their families,

36:54.538 --> 36:55.938
I realized that I'm lucky

36:55.940 --> 36:58.373
I don't have to wait
till break for that.

37:00.176 --> 37:03.145
That's a nice way
to think about it.

37:03.147 --> 37:05.581
Mom.

37:06.549 --> 37:09.051
I really love this.

37:09.053 --> 37:11.687
Being able to come home
and stay with you.

37:15.124 --> 37:17.392
♪

37:51.427 --> 37:52.894
Ten-hut!

37:52.896 --> 37:55.030
You were never here,
neither was I.

37:55.032 --> 37:57.065

that they cheated

38:12.683 --> 38:15.250
on the psychological
fitness test?

38:17.520 --> 38:20.022
And that it was wrong.

38:20.024 --> 38:22.124
Anybody?

38:22.126 --> 38:24.326
No, sir!

38:26.729 --> 38:28.764
Second of all,

38:28.766 --> 38:31.633
thank you for your service.

38:31.635 --> 38:35.837
The NYPD places great value
in your experience.

38:37.473 --> 38:39.941
So we're gonna take
a mulligan here.

38:43.546 --> 38:46.248
Just as in your military unit,

38:46.250 --> 38:49.418
the NYPD takes care of its own.

38:50.988 --> 38:54.423
So, I'm gonna give
each of you the chance

38:54.425 --> 38:57.693
to thoroughly explain
why you feel

38:57.695 --> 39:00.462
you are fit for this duty.

Face-to-face.

39:16.246 --> 39:18.013
Yes, sir.

39:18.015 --> 39:20.382
How you doing, Martin?

39:20.384 --> 39:23.085
I'm great, sir, thank you.

39:23.087 --> 39:25.420
The truth, please.

39:26.789 --> 39:28.890
I'm sweating bullets, sir.

39:31.661 --> 39:34.996
Well, we have
