WEBVTT

00:00.721 --> 00:03.325
President Conrad Dalton's
inauguration is only one day

00:03.326 --> 00:05.410
away, but he's still
facing a legal challenge

00:05.411 --> 00:07.134
to the legitimacy of his win.

00:07.204 --> 00:08.850
Governor Sam Evans filed a lawsuit

00:08.851 --> 00:10.908
against the state of
Ohio for allowing Dalton

00:10.909 --> 00:11.869
to be put on the ballot,

00:11.870 --> 00:13.707
citing a little known
anti-lobbying law called

00:13.708 --> 00:15.009
the Vasey Act.

00:15.010 --> 00:17.153
Today we've learned the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

00:17.154 --> 00:18.279
has agreed to hear the case.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.781
If the court rules

00:19.782 --> 00:20.849
in Evans' favor,

00:20.850 --> 00:23.184
it could not only revoke
Dalton's presidency,

00:23.185 --> 00:24.853
it could spark a constitutional crisis

00:24.854 --> 00:26.621
that would shake the very foundation

00:26.622 --> 00:28.356
our government was built upon.

00:28.357 --> 00:30.191
What's shaking the very foundation now?

00:30.192 --> 00:32.460
We begin our team coverage in...

00:32.461 --> 00:34.262
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

00:34.263 --> 00:35.563
has agreed to hear Evans' case

00:35.564 --> 00:36.831
against Ohio.

00:36.832 --> 00:39.067
Unbelievable. What are they thinking?

00:39.068 --> 00:42.403
Are they really gonna uphold
some obscure law from 1893?

00:42.404 --> 00:44.138
We'll find out.

00:44.139 --> 00:45.573
Hey,

00:45.574 --> 00:46.608
here's something weird.

00:46.609 --> 00:49.177
I got a call from the CIA.

00:49.178 --> 00:53.681
They want me to come in for
an Ex Post Facto Re-debrief

00:53.682 --> 00:55.450
regarding Black Dog Station.

00:55.451 --> 00:59.153
Well, I was in the CIA for 20 years

00:59.154 --> 01:00.088
and I've never heard of

01:00.089 --> 01:03.358
an Ex Post Facto Re-debrief.

01:03.359 --> 01:04.879
When they shut down the operation down

01:04.881 --> 01:05.984
they called it a "hotwash."

01:05.985 --> 01:09.163
Now they want to get me debriefed.

01:09.164 --> 01:10.765
Why does all their
terminology sound like

01:10.766 --> 01:12.389
something that happens
in a nursing home?

01:13.869 --> 01:15.403
Baby, you okay?

01:15.404 --> 01:17.372
Yeah. Why?

01:17.373 --> 01:20.308
When you get anxious you
take it out on your clothes.

01:24.413 --> 01:27.482
Evans is naming me
specifically in the lawsuit.

01:27.483 --> 01:29.250
He's accusing me

01:29.251 --> 01:33.421
of making overtures to
influence Ohio state senators.

01:33.422 --> 01:35.156
When I did that NFL thing

01:35.157 --> 01:36.157
in Ohio,

01:36.158 --> 01:40.161
I also took some
legislators out to dinner.

01:40.162 --> 01:41.529
Applebee's.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.231
That's where they wanted to go.

01:43.232 --> 01:46.501
I unduly influenced them with
potato skins and hot wings.

01:46.502 --> 01:49.938
Look, I think the only reason
they're hearing the case

01:49.939 --> 01:52.307
is so that Evans can't cry foul.

01:52.308 --> 01:53.608
They're not gonna

01:53.609 --> 01:56.077
upend all of American
politics over this.

01:56.078 --> 01:57.478
Well, either way,

01:57.479 --> 01:59.347
the whole thing is putting a damper

01:59.348 --> 02:00.515
on the inauguration tomorrow.

02:00.516 --> 02:02.083
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

02:02.084 --> 02:04.686
- Are you cleaning out your closet?
- Maybe.

02:04.687 --> 02:06.788
So this is a good time to talk about

02:06.789 --> 02:08.622
what you're wearing
to the inaugural ball?

02:08.624 --> 02:10.792
As good a time as any, I guess.

02:10.793 --> 02:12.927
A stylist is gonna bring some gowns

02:12.928 --> 02:15.830
to the office and I'm
gonna choose from those.

02:15.831 --> 02:16.898
Really?

02:16.899 --> 02:18.166
Can I come?

02:18.167 --> 02:20.001
You can do better than that.

02:20.002 --> 02:21.269
You can choose for me.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.870
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

02:22.871 --> 02:24.305
Can I also blog about it?

02:24.306 --> 02:25.340
Blog your heart out.

02:25.341 --> 02:26.674
You're the best.

02:26.675 --> 02:28.495
I'll come to your office
right after school.

02:33.748 --> 02:36.616
Okay, my mood is starting
to turn around a little bit.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.222
Hey, you're looking very Wow.

02:41.223 --> 02:43.291
Young DC professional

02:43.292 --> 02:44.759
poised to take over the world,

02:44.760 --> 02:46.694
with just a dash of girlish charm.

02:46.695 --> 02:49.764
Well, that is exactly
what I was going for.

02:49.765 --> 02:51.131
That's right.

02:51.132 --> 02:53.475
It's the first day of your
internship with Russell Jackson.

02:53.476 --> 02:54.335
Are you excited?

02:54.336 --> 02:56.571
With just a dash of terrified.

02:56.572 --> 02:58.906
I still can't believe
he offered me the job.

02:58.907 --> 03:00.508
You saved the guy's
life, I think he felt

03:00.509 --> 03:01.692
it was the least he could do.

03:01.693 --> 03:03.378
He's really scary, though.

03:03.379 --> 03:06.981
Trust me, there is way more bark

03:06.982 --> 03:08.616
than bite with him.

03:08.617 --> 03:10.344
And that was before the heart attack.

03:10.345 --> 03:11.386
I mean, he's just coming back from

03:11.387 --> 03:13.021
a three-week whale-watching cruise.

03:13.022 --> 03:15.063
If that doesn't mellow
you out, nothing can.

03:15.758 --> 03:17.725
Lord.

03:17.726 --> 03:20.395
Inauguration week is
really getting to Blake.

03:20.396 --> 03:24.298
- Bye, guys. - Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

03:24.299 --> 03:25.482
Hi, Blake, everything's good,

03:25.483 --> 03:27.735
I'm just on my way to the office.

03:27.736 --> 03:29.670
Whoa, slow down, slow down, slow down.

03:29.671 --> 03:32.206
Blake, I thought we talked about decaf.

03:32.207 --> 03:34.742
What...

03:34.743 --> 03:36.010
Gifts?

03:38.113 --> 03:39.747
Wow.

03:39.748 --> 03:41.883
You weren't exaggerating.

03:41.884 --> 03:43.217
Yeah.

03:43.218 --> 03:44.519
Sorry for sounding overwhelmed

03:44.520 --> 03:46.621
and possibly even a
little nudgy, it's just

03:46.622 --> 03:49.424
I can't move any of these
until you sign off on them.

03:49.425 --> 03:51.626
Then they have to be processed
by the Protocol Gift Unit

03:51.627 --> 03:52.602
and-and catalogued

03:52.603 --> 03:53.623
by the National Archive.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.727
And there's a room on the
third floor that looks like.

03:55.728 --> 03:56.731
Ali Baba's cave.

03:56.732 --> 03:57.899
It's okay.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.200
We'll get through it together.

03:59.201 --> 04:01.002
No, we won't.

04:01.003 --> 04:02.737
Now I have to go to
the Port of Baltimore

04:02.738 --> 04:04.305
to sign for a gift from.

04:04.306 --> 04:07.375
Byambyn Sendoo, the Mongolian
minister of education.

04:07.376 --> 04:08.743
Why do you have to sign for it?

04:08.744 --> 04:09.777
They wouldn't say.

04:09.778 --> 04:11.679
They were being very Port Authoritarian.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.516
All right, look, you,
go sign for the gift,

04:15.517 --> 04:18.820
and I'll start signing off on these,

04:18.821 --> 04:22.590
and-and we'll just think
of the whole thing as...

04:22.591 --> 04:23.658
an adventure.

04:23.659 --> 04:26.594
Adventures in hell.

04:26.595 --> 04:27.562
I'm sorry.

04:27.563 --> 04:29.106
Madam Secretary, I will course-correct

04:29.107 --> 04:30.698
immediately. You know,

04:30.699 --> 04:31.899
it's good to be the winner.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.335
- These are the spoils of victory.
- Yeah.

04:34.336 --> 04:35.879
I mean, unless the Sixth Circuit Court

04:35.880 --> 04:38.005
finds in favor of Sam Evans.

04:38.006 --> 04:39.373
Then we have to send it all back.

04:41.643 --> 04:42.844
Go.

04:42.845 --> 04:44.545
Drive safe.

04:44.546 --> 04:45.947
- What?
- Just for that,

04:45.948 --> 04:48.081
- you're gonna help me sort.
- Awesome.

04:49.052 --> 04:50.341
Boy.

04:50.342 --> 04:51.919
- What's that?
- It's nothing.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.320
Go, go.

04:55.656 --> 04:57.024
Sort.

04:57.025 --> 04:58.593
What are the categories?

04:59.761 --> 05:01.384
Don't worry about it,
my dad's a hoarder.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.385
I'll figure it out.

05:06.969 --> 05:08.369
Russell.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.271
Welcome back.

05:10.272 --> 05:11.272
How are you feeling?

05:11.273 --> 05:12.907
Top-notch.

05:12.908 --> 05:15.476
So... the cruise was great?

05:15.477 --> 05:17.979
The cruise was excruciating.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.180
Three weeks of watching

05:19.181 --> 05:21.883
what's left of the glaciers float past

05:21.884 --> 05:23.067
and trying to catch a glimpse

05:23.068 --> 05:24.352
of a whale.

05:24.353 --> 05:26.193
Damn leisure time is
gonna kill me a lot faster

05:26.194 --> 05:26.973
than my arteries.

05:26.974 --> 05:28.756
Well, it's nice to have you back.

05:28.757 --> 05:31.959
Jumping right into the fire, no
less, with this Evans debacle.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.943
We thought you might
want to lend a voice

05:33.944 --> 05:35.015
to our strategy session.

05:35.016 --> 05:37.398
Figuring out some way
to derail this lawsuit.

05:37.399 --> 05:41.402
I'm not sure where
there's much room to move.

05:41.403 --> 05:43.437
We can't influence the court.

05:43.438 --> 05:46.407
No, but we can put
them under a spotlight.

05:46.408 --> 05:50.745
Launch a press campaign pointing
out the lack of precedent,

05:50.746 --> 05:53.281
lean hard on the court's obligation

05:53.282 --> 05:54.905
to consider the
stability of the country,

05:54.906 --> 05:56.617
the sanctity of the Electoral College.

05:56.618 --> 05:58.719
Of course, that approach
relies on appealing

05:58.720 --> 06:00.588
to people's higher nature and...

06:00.589 --> 06:02.423
you know how much faith I have in that.

06:02.424 --> 06:04.125
Or we can try to influence Evans.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.260
Who doesn't have a higher
nature to appeal to.

06:06.261 --> 06:08.629
He might be able to
listen to reason, and...

06:08.630 --> 06:11.799
as the aggrieved party, he
can withdraw the complaint.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.534
We can remind him that if he persists,

06:13.535 --> 06:15.570
he won't only be burning
bridges in Washington,

06:15.571 --> 06:18.772
he risks burning down American
democracy in the process.

06:21.609 --> 06:23.110
Okay,

06:23.111 --> 06:26.012
y-you guys are really gonna
make me be the one to say it?

06:27.348 --> 06:28.716
The oppo research.

06:31.186 --> 06:32.720
What happened to being a knight?

06:32.721 --> 06:36.157
The painkillers have worn off.

06:36.158 --> 06:37.592
And they've upped the game.

06:37.593 --> 06:39.976
This is isn't about trying to
influence an election anymore.

06:39.977 --> 06:40.895
Election's over.

06:40.896 --> 06:42.396
This is about dissuading someone

06:42.397 --> 06:44.465
from blatantly abusing the court system

06:44.466 --> 06:46.167
to change the results.

06:46.168 --> 06:47.401
Look,

06:47.402 --> 06:49.737
I-it's not even as dirty as it sounds.

06:49.738 --> 06:52.607
The guy has the gene for
early-onset Alzheimer's

06:52.608 --> 06:54.942
and he didn't disclose
the genetic testing

06:54.943 --> 06:57.078
with the rest of his health report.

06:57.079 --> 07:00.081
Now, who knows, maybe the
voting public wouldn't care.

07:00.082 --> 07:01.981
But they had the right to know.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.686
I can't bring myself to do it, Russell.

07:05.687 --> 07:08.489
We'll just have to let the
chips fall where they may.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.157
What about offering Evans

07:10.158 --> 07:12.126
a position in the White House?

07:12.127 --> 07:13.427
Some sort of advisor.

07:13.428 --> 07:14.996
Maybe even a Cabinet post.

07:14.997 --> 07:18.165
Something prestigious that
we could also live with.

07:18.166 --> 07:22.837
It's unifying and bipartisan.

07:22.838 --> 07:24.438
Who knows, we might even learn something

07:24.462 --> 07:25.473
from his point of view.

07:25.474 --> 07:28.376
Pushed it a little there at the end.

07:28.377 --> 07:31.879
But... there is an argument to be made

07:31.880 --> 07:36.017
for keeping him close by.

07:36.018 --> 07:37.350
It's doable.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.121
Then let's do it.

07:45.459 --> 07:46.794
Abdul-Hafiz Bakkal.

07:46.795 --> 07:48.663
- I've never heard of him.
- Dabir Fakoury?

07:48.664 --> 07:50.898
Dabir Fakoury's an ISIS leader.

07:50.899 --> 07:52.900
Did he ever cross paths
with Hizb Al-Shahid

07:52.901 --> 07:54.702
during your time with Black Dog Station?

07:54.703 --> 07:56.537
Not that I know of.

07:56.538 --> 07:59.840
So you're tracking a connection

07:59.841 --> 08:02.443
between HS and ISIS?

08:02.444 --> 08:03.411
What about Yunis Hamawi?

08:03.412 --> 08:06.614
Also ISIS.

08:06.615 --> 08:08.649
Did his name ever come up?

08:08.650 --> 08:11.185
You guys want to tell
me what this is about?

08:11.186 --> 08:12.553
I might actually be able to help.

08:12.554 --> 08:14.217
So you never found
any concrete connection

08:14.218 --> 08:16.957
between HS and ISIS other
than a shared ideology.

08:16.958 --> 08:18.793
They don't have a shared ideology,

08:18.794 --> 08:20.328
they have a common goal.

08:20.329 --> 08:21.829
A shared ideology would make them

08:21.830 --> 08:23.931
much more dangerous, and, again,

08:23.932 --> 08:25.299
do you want to let me in on that?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.523
We're not authorized to do so,

08:26.524 --> 08:27.835
- Dr. McCord.
- Excuse me,

08:27.836 --> 08:29.870
you're aware of my involvement

08:29.871 --> 08:32.472
in both operations that
effectively dismantled HS,

08:32.474 --> 08:35.809
and yet you're telling me that
my clearance isn't high enough

08:35.811 --> 08:37.745
to be filled in?

08:37.746 --> 08:39.412
That's what we're telling you.

08:40.815 --> 08:43.217
I think we've gotten everything we need.

08:43.217 --> 08:46.354
Thank you for your time.

08:46.355 --> 08:48.700
I'm heading back in
the office now, Blake.

08:48.701 --> 08:49.990
Well, I'm still

08:49.991 --> 08:50.788
at the Port of Baltimore.

08:50.789 --> 08:52.173
I just wanted to let you know that

08:52.174 --> 08:53.774
I am unable to bring the gift home today

08:53.775 --> 08:55.416
because they won't
release it from customs

08:55.417 --> 08:57.102
until it undergoes a
three-day quarantine.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.695
Quarantine? Why?

08:59.464 --> 09:02.100
Because it's a horse.

09:02.101 --> 09:03.168
I'm sorry,

09:03.169 --> 09:04.512
it sounded like you said "horse."

09:04.513 --> 09:05.403
Yes, ma'am.

09:05.404 --> 09:08.540
Minister Sendoo has
sent you a Mongol horse,

09:08.541 --> 09:10.341
it's a...

09:10.342 --> 09:12.544
symbol of national pride and unity.

09:12.545 --> 09:14.445
I have to say, she is gorgeous.

09:14.446 --> 09:15.914
My God.

09:15.915 --> 09:17.148
Send it back.

09:17.149 --> 09:19.751
- Her, and I already signed for her.
- Well, un-sign.

09:19.752 --> 09:21.553
Make it clear that

09:21.554 --> 09:23.288
we are respectfully declining

09:23.289 --> 09:24.789
the gift horse.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.858
May I ask why?

09:26.859 --> 09:30.595
So many reasons, not
the least of which...

09:30.596 --> 09:33.731
we don't have anywhere in the
state department to put her.

09:33.732 --> 09:35.275
I'm sure there's some government-owned

09:35.276 --> 09:36.701
horse property somewhere.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.902
It's not about that.

09:37.903 --> 09:40.838
This is about the
Mongolian referendum vote

09:40.839 --> 09:43.841
to become an autonomous region of China.

09:43.842 --> 09:45.009
Minister Sendoo

09:45.010 --> 09:46.678
favors remaining independent,

09:46.679 --> 09:48.713
and by accepting the horse,

09:48.714 --> 09:51.783
it will signal...

09:51.784 --> 09:54.185
a tacit endorsement of that position.

09:54.186 --> 09:55.753
Because the horse,

09:55.754 --> 09:57.889
symbol of national pride and unity.

09:57.890 --> 09:58.890
See?

09:58.891 --> 10:00.191
Right, right.

10:00.192 --> 10:01.292
That'll make China mad.

10:01.293 --> 10:03.728
And many other Asian nations,

10:03.729 --> 10:05.152
and quite a few Mongolians as well.

10:05.153 --> 10:06.030
Got it.

10:06.031 --> 10:08.333
I will explain the situation

10:08.334 --> 10:10.034
to the Port Authoritarians.

10:10.035 --> 10:11.569
This may take a while.

10:12.671 --> 10:14.038
She's really pretty?

10:14.039 --> 10:15.206
Yes, ma'am.

10:15.207 --> 10:17.375
She's... she's kind
of a cappuccino color,

10:17.376 --> 10:19.177
with a chestnut stripe down her back...

10:19.178 --> 10:20.445
Hanging up now.

10:20.446 --> 10:23.681
Yes, ma'am.

10:23.682 --> 10:24.749
Hi.

10:26.952 --> 10:29.087
"Press the operational
code into the keypad

10:29.088 --> 10:30.855
and hold it down until
you hear the beep."

10:30.856 --> 10:32.490
Yeah, I did that.

10:32.491 --> 10:33.491
How's it going?

10:33.492 --> 10:34.643
Fine, sir.

10:34.644 --> 10:37.028
You can call maintenance if
you're having trouble with that.

10:37.863 --> 10:39.497
I was just about to figure it out.

10:39.498 --> 10:41.881
Adele, will you call maintenance
to program this damn thing?

10:41.882 --> 10:43.915
Yes, sir.

10:44.669 --> 10:48.172
I, I don't like interns.

10:48.173 --> 10:51.542
I never have, I can never find
anything I trust them to do.

10:51.543 --> 10:52.777
- Well...
- Now, I-I...

10:52.778 --> 10:54.178
I'm giving you a chance

10:54.179 --> 10:56.082
- to change my mind.
- I'm honored, Mr. Jackson.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.515
But, there is no bank for good will

10:57.516 --> 10:59.617
around here; You saved
my life, I gave you a job.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.752
- We're even.
- Yes, sir.

11:00.753 --> 11:04.055
Poet Laureate Roland... somebody

11:04.056 --> 11:06.157
is coming in from
Connecticut this afternoon,

11:06.158 --> 11:09.227
he'll be reading a poem at
the inauguration tomorrow.

11:09.228 --> 11:12.697
You can thank JFK for
this enduring legacy

11:12.698 --> 11:15.366
which forces us to stand in
the cold an extra 20 minutes.

11:15.367 --> 11:19.304
Roland Hobbs? I love his work.

11:19.305 --> 11:21.839
I-I actually wrote a paper on
him for my AP English class.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.041
Great. Tell him all about it.

11:23.042 --> 11:25.610
He fancies himself a man of the people,

11:25.611 --> 11:28.112
so he refused to let us
pick him up in a limo.

11:28.113 --> 11:29.981
He was gonna take a
cab from the airport,

11:29.982 --> 11:31.749
but I can't take a chance on losing him,

11:31.750 --> 11:33.584
so he finally agreed to
let us send an intern.

11:33.585 --> 11:35.653
Adele has all the information.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.023
Awesome. That's just so exciting.

11:39.024 --> 11:41.225
Um, thank you. I won't let you down.

11:41.226 --> 11:42.427
Tick tock.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.099
Minister Sendoo, I
am touched and honored

11:48.100 --> 11:51.636
by your generous gift of a Mongol horse.

11:51.637 --> 11:53.304
Unfortunately,

11:53.305 --> 11:56.474
I'm not allowed to
keep diplomatic gifts,

11:56.475 --> 12:00.712
and, well, we just have
no place to put a horse

12:00.713 --> 12:02.980
here in the state department.

12:02.981 --> 12:05.983
I'm very sorry to hear
that, Madam Secretary.

12:05.984 --> 12:09.520
Because we cannot risk
exposing our horse population

12:09.521 --> 12:11.456
to any foreign strains of disease.

12:11.457 --> 12:12.924
If a horse is returned to us

12:12.925 --> 12:16.094
after having been abroad,

12:16.095 --> 12:17.829
it must be euthanized.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.731
You're going to kill her?

12:19.732 --> 12:22.833
Perhaps you would like to reconsider.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:35.127 --> 12:37.797
Did you really accept a horse
from the Mongolian minister

12:37.798 --> 12:39.760
- of education?
- No.

12:39.761 --> 12:41.264
Then why is the president of Mongolia

12:41.265 --> 12:42.964
calling me to complain about it?

12:42.965 --> 12:45.533
I don't have enough going
on, trying to stop Sam Evans

12:45.534 --> 12:47.702
from making rubble out
of the Constitution?

12:47.703 --> 12:50.738
He's all the big dumb mammal
I can handle right now.

12:50.739 --> 12:52.073
Send the horse back.

12:52.074 --> 12:53.140
I'm working on it.

12:53.141 --> 12:54.208
What's-what's to work on?

12:54.209 --> 12:55.910
You can't find the return address?

12:55.911 --> 12:58.346
The problem is, Russell,

12:58.347 --> 13:01.015
Minister Sendoo says that they
can't reintegrate the horse

13:01.016 --> 13:02.316
now that it's left the country,

13:02.317 --> 13:04.585
so if we return her,

13:04.586 --> 13:05.820
they will...

13:05.821 --> 13:07.054
terminate her.

13:07.055 --> 13:09.557
What?

13:09.558 --> 13:10.891
They're bluffing.

13:10.892 --> 13:12.827
It's a classic Mongolian squeeze play.

13:12.828 --> 13:14.595
Russell,

13:14.596 --> 13:17.832
do you really want a YouTube video

13:17.833 --> 13:19.734
of a dying horse flying
around the first month

13:19.735 --> 13:21.736
of Dalton's second term?

13:21.737 --> 13:24.672
Our staff is working diligently
to find the horse a safe haven,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.574
one that is both suitable

13:26.575 --> 13:29.210
and will not offend anyone politically.

13:29.211 --> 13:30.444
Well, hurry up.

13:30.445 --> 13:31.479
We're on it.

13:31.480 --> 13:36.317
And, Russell, you may
want to pace yourself.

13:36.318 --> 13:37.985
I am pacing myself.

13:37.986 --> 13:41.122
4,782 paces, to be exact.

13:41.123 --> 13:44.125
Why do you think I walked
all the way over here?

13:44.126 --> 13:45.493
And stop coddling me.

13:45.494 --> 13:47.094
They vacuumed my heart end to end.

13:47.095 --> 13:49.930
My arteries are cleaner than yours.

13:49.931 --> 13:51.899
Make the horse thing go away.

13:54.202 --> 13:55.903
Mr. Hobbs?

13:55.904 --> 13:57.972
Hi, Mr. Hobbs, I'm Stephanie McCord.

13:57.973 --> 13:59.907
Um, I'm Russell Jackson's intern.

13:59.908 --> 14:03.686
He sent me to pick you up
a-and take you to your hotel.

14:03.687 --> 14:04.720
What are you doing?

14:04.721 --> 14:05.988
Excuse me?

14:05.989 --> 14:08.324
You should be ferry-hopping
through the Greek isles

14:08.325 --> 14:09.826
with nothing but a summer frock,

14:09.827 --> 14:13.261
a wineskin and a
battered copy of Rimbaud.

14:13.996 --> 14:17.133
Well, um, I'm doing this.

14:17.134 --> 14:20.036
By the way, Mr. Jackson's
office sent me a copy of the poem

14:20.037 --> 14:22.371
that you're planning on
reading tomorrow and...

14:22.372 --> 14:24.140
I think it's amazing.

14:24.141 --> 14:25.740
That insipid rant?

14:26.676 --> 14:28.377
They were pressuring me
to come up with something

14:28.378 --> 14:29.579
so they could approve it.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.280
I would no more read that aloud

14:31.281 --> 14:32.949
than I would evacuate my bowels

14:32.950 --> 14:34.383
in public.

14:34.384 --> 14:36.219
Wow. Okay. Um,

14:36.220 --> 14:39.122
so, I guess you probably want
to get straight to the hotel

14:39.123 --> 14:40.456
to work on your replacement poem.

14:40.457 --> 14:42.291
Um, they have you booked at the Vinton.

14:42.292 --> 14:43.326
It's really nice.

14:43.327 --> 14:45.495
It sounds like a soulless corporate pod.

14:45.496 --> 14:47.039
I'm not gonna get any work done there.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.066
Well, is-is there somewhere
else that you'd rather go?

14:51.502 --> 14:54.036
Maybe just a drive around the city.

14:54.037 --> 14:56.772
Perhaps if I see a few
monuments to democracy,

14:56.773 --> 14:59.041
I could get the creative engine moving.

14:59.042 --> 15:02.278
Sure, the traffic does
tend to get a little crazy

15:02.279 --> 15:04.847
at this time of...

15:04.848 --> 15:06.315
Let's do that.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.921
What the...?

15:11.922 --> 15:13.888
Murderer!

15:23.332 --> 15:24.734
Dr. McCord is here.

15:24.735 --> 15:26.198
If you're looking for your daughter,

15:26.199 --> 15:27.637
she's off on assignment.

15:27.638 --> 15:29.172
I'm looking for you.

15:29.173 --> 15:30.573
Go.

15:30.574 --> 15:32.608
Are you gonna keep doing that?

15:32.609 --> 15:33.809
You think I'm enjoying this?

15:33.810 --> 15:37.280
Okay, look, I just got
back from some cryptic

15:37.281 --> 15:39.682
re-debrief at the CIA.

15:39.683 --> 15:41.384
Why are they running random names by me,

15:41.385 --> 15:42.652
trying to draw connections

15:42.653 --> 15:43.819
between HS and ISIS?

15:43.820 --> 15:44.887
CIA, they're cryptic.

15:44.888 --> 15:46.155
Has HS joined ISIS?

15:46.156 --> 15:48.958
Are they being reconstituted?

15:48.959 --> 15:50.159
It's classified.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.095
Give me a break. I
originated the operation.

15:53.096 --> 15:55.598
Excuse me, I originated the operation.

15:55.599 --> 15:56.782
Just tell me what's going on.

15:59.536 --> 16:03.172
It's about the Illinois bomber.

16:03.173 --> 16:06.342
He was radicalized at an
ISIS-affiliated madrassa

16:06.343 --> 16:08.811
in Saudi Arabia, but
we have reports that say

16:08.812 --> 16:11.747
he was also communicating
with HS-affiliated terrorists.

16:11.748 --> 16:13.182
The NSA has been

16:13.183 --> 16:14.784
trying to hack into the bomber's phone

16:14.785 --> 16:17.887
to gather data, but
their efforts have been...

16:17.888 --> 16:19.021
unproductive.

16:19.022 --> 16:20.957
The NSA can't hack into a cell phone?

16:20.958 --> 16:23.326
Well, they're limited
by money and man-hours

16:23.327 --> 16:25.261
like any other human institution.

16:25.262 --> 16:27.630
So they're combing all
their assets for tips,

16:27.631 --> 16:29.699
to avoid paying an exorbitant fee

16:29.700 --> 16:31.300
to an outside cyber security consultant.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.134
Exactly.

16:32.135 --> 16:34.870
Because the CEO of this
particular phone company,

16:34.871 --> 16:38.507
Warren Lee, is a big
donor to our campaign.

16:38.508 --> 16:41.344
But he's also a big privacy advocate.

16:41.345 --> 16:43.412
And a diligent practitioner of Taoism.

16:43.413 --> 16:45.881
- Really?
- Well,

16:45.882 --> 16:47.717
as diligent as a Taoist can be,

16:47.718 --> 16:49.318
given that it's about effortless action.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.653
It's a theological paradox.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.788
Yeah, hell, what isn't?

16:52.789 --> 16:55.009
So you were just gonna box
me out of this whole thing?

16:55.958 --> 16:58.361
If you want in,

16:58.362 --> 17:01.097
tell me what you're thinking.

17:01.098 --> 17:03.966
Warren Lee's in town
for the inauguration.

17:03.967 --> 17:05.768
POTUS can only push him so far

17:05.769 --> 17:07.603
on the investigation
without looking like

17:07.604 --> 17:09.972
an anti-Fourth Amendment bully.

17:09.973 --> 17:11.941
But a third party with
an oblique connection

17:11.942 --> 17:13.709
to the administration,

17:13.710 --> 17:15.845
who speaks the language
of theological paradox?

17:15.846 --> 17:18.314
Knock yourself out.

17:18.315 --> 17:21.883
Corner him at the inaugural ball.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.420
I've got a better idea.

17:24.421 --> 17:25.488
I'd love a better idea.

17:25.489 --> 17:27.790
Tell me when it pans out.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.925
What am I doing wrong?

17:29.926 --> 17:31.527
I got you.

17:32.792 --> 17:33.792
There you go.

17:34.831 --> 17:36.065
I thought I did that.

17:36.066 --> 17:37.300
Ma'am,

17:37.301 --> 17:39.564
Foreign Minister Chen has
requested a SVTC call with you.

17:39.565 --> 17:41.837
I took the liberty of setting it up.

17:41.838 --> 17:43.806
His office is on hold right now.

17:43.807 --> 17:45.775
Well, that didn't take long.

17:45.776 --> 17:47.409
So, Blake's still out?

17:48.811 --> 17:50.212
He's been further detained.

17:50.213 --> 17:52.048
Yeah, he ran into some protesters

17:52.049 --> 17:54.183
from the Equine Resource
League in a parking lot

17:54.184 --> 17:55.885
at the Port of Baltimore.

17:55.886 --> 17:57.720
They pelted him and his car with manure.

17:57.721 --> 17:59.655
Is he okay?

17:59.656 --> 18:01.857
He's, rattled.

18:01.858 --> 18:04.527
What are they protesting anyway?

18:04.528 --> 18:06.929
Somebody sent me a horse?

18:06.930 --> 18:10.333
No, ma'am, that you're
sending her back to Mongolia

18:10.334 --> 18:12.034
where she'll be euthanized.

18:12.035 --> 18:14.637
How on earth did they find out?

18:14.638 --> 18:16.101
We're getting to the bottom of that.

18:16.102 --> 18:18.274
But they have all the
information on the Web site.

18:18.275 --> 18:20.943
They claim you're sending
a purebred to its death

18:20.944 --> 18:22.278
over a diplomatic dispute.

18:22.279 --> 18:24.347
They're encouraging a widespread protest

18:24.348 --> 18:28.450
until the U.S. accepts the horse
and gives her a loving home.

18:28.951 --> 18:31.587
So...

18:31.588 --> 18:34.123
how does Blake sound?

18:34.124 --> 18:38.260
Um, remember when pigeons
got into his apartment

18:38.261 --> 18:39.628
when he was out of town?

18:39.629 --> 18:41.964
Wow, that bad?

18:41.965 --> 18:43.165
Worse.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.835
Shall I put someone on his
desk until he comes back?

18:45.836 --> 18:48.037
Not unless you want to finish him off.

18:48.038 --> 18:49.739
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Noodle.

18:49.740 --> 18:52.141
The dresses just
arrived from the stylist.

18:52.142 --> 18:54.843
Wow, I...

18:55.644 --> 18:57.246
What do we like?

18:57.247 --> 18:59.715
Honestly? None of them.

19:02.618 --> 19:03.853
Not even this?

19:03.854 --> 19:04.987
You can't wear black.

19:04.988 --> 19:06.922
It's a celebration, not a funeral.

19:06.923 --> 19:10.226
Well... tell you what,

19:10.227 --> 19:12.061
why don't we just forget about these?

19:12.062 --> 19:13.629
Why don't you just be the stylist?

19:13.630 --> 19:16.832
And you find something you like
and we'll track it down, okay?

19:16.833 --> 19:18.267
Really?

19:18.268 --> 19:20.102
This is amazing!

19:20.103 --> 19:22.705
My first assignment
is the inaugural ball?

19:22.706 --> 19:25.040
Yeah, and your first client
carried you in her womb,

19:25.041 --> 19:26.624
so she's probably gonna go easy on you.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.309
Ma'am,

19:27.310 --> 19:29.111
I'll get back to you
as soon as we find out

19:29.112 --> 19:30.575
who leaked the information on Mandy.

19:30.576 --> 19:32.381
Excuse me? Mandy?

19:32.382 --> 19:34.016
Blake named her.

19:34.017 --> 19:36.185
- Apparently, they formed a bond.
- No.

19:36.186 --> 19:38.287
No naming the horse, it's
just gonna make it worse

19:38.288 --> 19:40.709
when we have to send her
back. That goes for everyone.

19:40.710 --> 19:41.757
- Okay.
- Yes, ma'am,

19:41.758 --> 19:45.161
no bonding with the horse.

19:45.162 --> 19:46.742
Minister Chen, still holding for you.

19:50.232 --> 19:54.236
Minister Chen, I'm so
sorry to keep you holding.

19:54.237 --> 19:56.405
My assistant is out of the office

19:56.406 --> 19:59.241
and, well, it's been a day
of excitement for all of us.

19:59.242 --> 20:01.977
I'm sure it's not every day
you receive a Mongolian horse

20:01.978 --> 20:04.680
as an inducement to intervene
in the democratic process

20:04.681 --> 20:06.347
of a foreign nation.

20:07.216 --> 20:11.420
The, horse was a
gift of congratulations

20:11.421 --> 20:15.391
from Minister Sendoo, not a bribe,

20:15.392 --> 20:18.394
and in any case, I've
already declined it.

20:18.395 --> 20:19.862
My concern is that

20:19.863 --> 20:22.565
even the perception of a
U.S. stance on independence

20:22.566 --> 20:24.033
could sway the outcome of the vote.

20:24.034 --> 20:26.969
Well, the U.S. position
on the referendum

20:26.970 --> 20:29.004
is one of neutrality.

20:29.005 --> 20:32.174
As I trust China's will be, as well.

20:32.175 --> 20:34.443
I am not the one accepting
gifts from the Mongolians.

20:34.444 --> 20:37.880
Well, that makes two of us.

20:37.881 --> 20:39.248
Always a pleasure

20:39.249 --> 20:40.216
talking to you.

20:40.217 --> 20:42.450
Good-bye, Madam Secretary.

20:43.219 --> 20:45.621
Blake, will you get me...

20:45.622 --> 20:49.091
I really... really don't like this.

20:49.092 --> 20:51.126
I don't know why I thought

20:51.127 --> 20:52.461
this would be inspiring.

20:52.462 --> 20:55.831
Religious altars to the
gods of money and power,

20:55.832 --> 20:58.868
statues to slave owners and warmongers,

20:58.869 --> 21:00.169
an obelisk

21:00.170 --> 21:02.938
extending into the sky

21:02.939 --> 21:06.509
like a great wagging phallus.

21:06.510 --> 21:09.311
Well, do you want to see Georgetown?

21:09.312 --> 21:11.313
It has a bit of a homier feel to it.

21:11.314 --> 21:13.649
Yes, by all means.

21:13.650 --> 21:14.950
Let us see where the exploiters

21:14.951 --> 21:17.620
of all that is sacred
rest their weary bones.

21:17.621 --> 21:19.655
Wait. Stop.

21:19.656 --> 21:21.056
What? Excuse me?

21:21.057 --> 21:22.324
- Stop!
- Okay.

21:22.325 --> 21:24.560
Are you okay?

21:24.561 --> 21:25.961
Inspiration.

21:25.962 --> 21:28.796
Mr. Hobbs, I-I don't think
I can park here. Mr...

21:34.337 --> 21:37.506
Governor, we understand
the symbolic gesture

21:37.507 --> 21:39.174
of filing suit against the state

21:39.175 --> 21:41.377
for overriding its sore-loser law

21:41.378 --> 21:42.878
and allowing us on the ballot.

21:42.879 --> 21:46.181
I can't imagine you
expected the Sixth Circuit

21:46.182 --> 21:48.384
to hear the case, and...

21:48.385 --> 21:51.954
now we find ourselves
in an awkward situation.

21:51.955 --> 21:53.938
On the contrary, I fully
expected them to hear it.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.991
There's nothing awkward about it for me.

21:55.992 --> 21:59.328
There was no impropriety on
the part of the secretary,

21:59.329 --> 22:00.563
and you know it.

22:00.564 --> 22:02.364
Even under whatever bogus,

22:02.365 --> 22:04.466
antiquated law you dug up.

22:04.467 --> 22:06.168
It's not about what I know, Russell,

22:06.169 --> 22:07.272
it's how the judge sees it.

22:07.273 --> 22:09.838
No president has ever been unseated

22:09.839 --> 22:11.407
by the judiciary,

22:11.408 --> 22:13.008
or even thrown out of office

22:13.009 --> 22:15.377
after impeachment, for that matter.

22:15.378 --> 22:17.780
The idea that the
court would do something

22:17.781 --> 22:20.349
as destabilizing as removing a president

22:20.350 --> 22:21.817
after his inauguration,

22:21.818 --> 22:23.986
replacing him with his
opponent, is laughable.

22:23.987 --> 22:25.054
If it's so laughable,

22:25.055 --> 22:26.358
why are you negotiating with me?

22:26.359 --> 22:30.626
This was a trying election for everyone.

22:30.627 --> 22:32.061
And instead of tying up the country

22:32.062 --> 22:33.485
in a court battle you'll never win,

22:33.486 --> 22:38.968
wouldn't your intellect
and passion and experience

22:38.969 --> 22:40.569
be put to better use by

22:40.570 --> 22:43.806
- serving in this administration?
- What do you have in mind?

22:43.807 --> 22:45.341
Your campaign platform made it clear

22:45.342 --> 22:48.110
that your priority is
fostering the growth

22:48.111 --> 22:51.113
of business and industry.

22:51.114 --> 22:53.449
We'd like you to come on board

22:53.450 --> 22:55.317
as our Secretary of Commerce.

22:55.318 --> 22:56.784
Are you joking?

23:01.224 --> 23:02.767
You two need to take this on the road.

23:02.768 --> 23:03.726
It's hilarious.

23:03.727 --> 23:07.029
There's only one post significant enough

23:07.030 --> 23:08.163
to make me want to walk away

23:08.164 --> 23:10.899
from rolling the dice
in the Sixth Circuit.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.167
State.

23:12.168 --> 23:14.702
- Excuse me?
- Secretary of state.

23:16.639 --> 23:18.607
Or the beat goes on.

23:18.608 --> 23:20.975
What do you say to that?

23:24.213 --> 23:26.914
Not gonna happen, Sam.

23:29.518 --> 23:31.986
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

23:42.716 --> 23:44.217
You're wasting your time.

23:44.930 --> 23:46.163
ERL is under no obligation

23:46.164 --> 23:47.798
to reveal the source of our information.

23:47.799 --> 23:50.401
Does it concern you at all that
any leak in the state department

23:50.402 --> 23:52.089
could be a matter of national security?

23:52.090 --> 23:53.068
That's your problem.

23:53.069 --> 23:55.203
I have the Freedom of
Information Act on my side.

23:55.204 --> 23:57.938
Did you get the information
directly from Minister Sendoo?

23:57.939 --> 24:00.514
Otherwise, there's no other explanation

24:00.515 --> 24:02.809
why it was on your Web site so fast.

24:02.810 --> 24:05.712
The foreign minister and I
had no direct communication.

24:05.713 --> 24:07.614
It's the minister of education.

24:07.615 --> 24:09.883
Do you even read your own
illegally obtained information?

24:09.884 --> 24:11.852
I'm starting to feel harassed here.

24:11.853 --> 24:13.453
If the Mongolese people want to use us

24:13.454 --> 24:15.055
to promote animal rights,

24:15.056 --> 24:16.556
we welcome their input.

24:16.557 --> 24:18.258
You mean the Mongolian people?

24:18.259 --> 24:20.327
Wait a minute.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.796
You barely know what I'm talking about.

24:22.797 --> 24:25.278
You didn't put that piece up on
the Web site yourself, did you?

24:25.279 --> 24:26.379
Where did it come from?

24:26.380 --> 24:29.668
You were hacked.

24:32.105 --> 24:33.473
Hey. How's your day going?

24:33.474 --> 24:35.676
A little crazy.

24:35.677 --> 24:37.944
I really need your help.

24:37.945 --> 24:40.280
I'm in a dive bar
with the poet laureate,

24:40.281 --> 24:42.851
who is supposed to be composing
a poem for the inauguration.

24:42.852 --> 24:43.556
Okay.

24:43.557 --> 24:45.758
Unless it's going to be about Scotch,

24:45.759 --> 24:47.358
I don't think that's gonna happen.

24:47.359 --> 24:48.559
I can't tell you the number of times

24:48.560 --> 24:50.023
I've been in that exact predicament.

24:50.024 --> 24:50.961
Are you serious?

24:50.962 --> 24:53.163
This is my first real
assignment for Russell Jackson,

24:53.164 --> 24:55.799
to get this guy safely to the hotel,

24:55.800 --> 24:56.900
and I can't do it.

24:56.901 --> 24:58.501
Well, there must be
a government employee

24:58.502 --> 24:59.332
who can handle it.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.205
I am a government employee.

25:01.206 --> 25:02.239
Yeah.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.208
Please? I can't stress Russell out.

25:04.209 --> 25:05.442
He just had a heart attack.

25:05.443 --> 25:07.266
- What do you want me to do?
- Come down here.

25:07.267 --> 25:09.346
You can at least...

25:09.347 --> 25:10.864
help me carry him to the car

25:10.865 --> 25:12.299
in case he starts to pass out.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.734
Okay. Text me the address.

25:13.735 --> 25:15.135
And please

25:15.136 --> 25:17.271
don't give that whole
"poetry is a useless waste

25:17.272 --> 25:19.573
"of time and brain cells" rant
in front of this guy, okay?

25:19.574 --> 25:21.174
Consider me censored.

25:21.175 --> 25:23.377
I'll see you in a bit.

25:30.951 --> 25:32.351
Excuse me, Mr. Lee?

25:34.087 --> 25:36.223
Aren't you Dr. Henry McCord?

25:36.224 --> 25:38.225
Yes. I-I'm so flattered
that you recognized me.

25:38.226 --> 25:40.327
Well, I've read all of your books.

25:40.328 --> 25:43.130
I consider myself a student
of the world's religions.

25:43.131 --> 25:44.331
So am I.

25:44.332 --> 25:46.967
I think some of the
sentiments of the Tao Te Ching

25:46.968 --> 25:48.735
are reflected in the
parables of the gospels,

25:48.736 --> 25:51.804
although I sometimes find
the language more poetic.

25:53.407 --> 25:57.244
So... do you practice here?

25:57.245 --> 26:00.781
No. I came to meet you.

26:00.782 --> 26:02.516
On behalf of your wife?

26:02.517 --> 26:04.383
On behalf of the NSA.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.654
Really?

26:07.655 --> 26:09.556
I sometimes do some consulting work.

26:09.557 --> 26:11.226
I have nothing left
to say to those guys.

26:11.227 --> 26:12.959
Look, I know they can
come on pretty strong,

26:12.960 --> 26:14.828
but they're probably just embarrassed

26:14.829 --> 26:16.730
and intimidated by you.

26:16.731 --> 26:18.932
So, because of their fragile psyches,

26:18.933 --> 26:21.368
I'm supposed to help them
burn up the Bill of Rights?

26:21.369 --> 26:23.503
It's one thing to defend
the Fourth Amendment,

26:23.504 --> 26:25.104
it's another thing to develop technology

26:25.128 --> 26:27.674
so impenetrable that it locks out

26:27.675 --> 26:29.276
the state's ability to investigate

26:29.277 --> 26:30.544
with probable cause.

26:30.545 --> 26:33.480
Giving the NSA access to
a private customer phone

26:33.481 --> 26:35.415
would set a terrible legal precedent.

26:35.416 --> 26:38.819
Maybe you need to
practice some of the tenets.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.587
Taoism has taught you,

26:40.588 --> 26:43.522
and let go of your longing.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.328
The world's religions aren't
the only thing I've learned from.

26:48.329 --> 26:50.192
In the intelligence
community, there's a method

26:50.193 --> 26:52.966
for developing assets
called "MIC"... M.I.C.

26:52.967 --> 26:56.036
First you try to persuade
with money... that's the "M."

26:56.037 --> 26:58.672
You have plenty of that.
"I" is for ideology.

26:58.673 --> 27:01.608
I tried to appeal to that, and I failed.

27:01.609 --> 27:04.244
And the "C" is for coercion,

27:04.245 --> 27:07.447
but as an ally of Dalton's...

27:07.448 --> 27:08.682
not a lot to coerce you with.

27:08.683 --> 27:11.685
So it seems...

27:11.686 --> 27:14.788
that you have run out of letters.

27:14.789 --> 27:16.990
Yes.

27:16.991 --> 27:19.009
All I can do now is humble
myself and appeal to you

27:19.010 --> 27:20.460
as someone who cares deeply about

27:20.461 --> 27:21.762
the welfare of this country.

27:21.763 --> 27:26.133
So few of us find
ourselves in your position.

27:26.134 --> 27:28.435
You have the U.S. government
groveling at your feet

27:28.436 --> 27:33.072
for a small piece of
proprietary information.

27:34.341 --> 27:36.909
You're the only person who can help us.

27:39.646 --> 27:41.948
Okay, here's what we're up against

27:41.949 --> 27:44.217
with finding a safe haven for the horse.

27:44.218 --> 27:46.520
It has to be a country
whose customs laws

27:46.521 --> 27:48.588
are lax enough to accept a horse

27:48.589 --> 27:50.557
who has been exposed to the diseases

27:50.558 --> 27:52.058
of two different countries.

27:52.059 --> 27:54.060
It would have to have
regular trade relations

27:54.061 --> 27:55.962
- with the U.S.
- Right.

27:55.963 --> 27:57.831
It would have to have a climate amenable

27:57.832 --> 27:59.800
to Mongol horses.

27:59.801 --> 28:02.068
And we'd need verifiable
first-class living conditions.

28:02.069 --> 28:04.337
No hiding her away on
some remote, decrepit farm

28:04.338 --> 28:05.672
in South America.

28:05.673 --> 28:08.442
She needs human interaction.
She was bred for that.

28:08.443 --> 28:11.344
Did she tell you that, horse whisperer?

28:11.345 --> 28:13.213
Blake, I believe you were warned

28:13.214 --> 28:14.981
about bonding with the horse.

28:14.982 --> 28:17.384
Like I can walk that back.

28:17.385 --> 28:19.820
Guys...

28:19.821 --> 28:21.588
CYBERCOM has made a forensic analysis

28:21.589 --> 28:22.956
on the ERL Web site hack,

28:22.957 --> 28:25.392
and they have a very strong
idea of who was behind it.

28:25.393 --> 28:27.327
- Russia?
- That's right, ma'am.

28:27.328 --> 28:29.129
As you know, they are
none too happy about

28:29.130 --> 28:31.264
the idea of China expanding its borders

28:31.265 --> 28:33.800
further across the southeastern
portion of its country.

28:33.801 --> 28:36.236
Well, or of China
expanding its land holdings

28:36.237 --> 28:37.971
and natural resources.

28:37.972 --> 28:39.172
But really?

28:39.173 --> 28:41.141
Enough to get into this?

28:41.142 --> 28:44.044
We figure that's why they
came at it so sideways.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.908
They don't want to destroy
relations with China

28:45.909 --> 28:46.847
any more than we do.

28:46.848 --> 28:48.615
Our working theory is that

28:48.616 --> 28:50.617
Russia may have ties
to Minister Sendoo's

28:50.618 --> 28:51.751
independence campaign

28:51.752 --> 28:54.621
and was hoping to
develop a little insurance

28:54.622 --> 28:55.989
in the event that we tried

28:55.990 --> 28:57.557
to send the horse back to Mongolia.

28:57.558 --> 28:59.493
Apparently, the minute Minister Sendoo

28:59.494 --> 29:01.751
hung up with you, he called
his connection in Russia,

29:01.752 --> 29:03.663
and then it ended up
on the ERL Web site,

29:03.664 --> 29:07.801
resulting in the... manure offensive.

29:07.802 --> 29:09.569
So this way Russia influences

29:09.570 --> 29:11.238
the outcome of the referendum

29:11.239 --> 29:14.841
but keeps its hands
clean of interventionism.

29:14.842 --> 29:15.504
Yes, ma'am.

29:15.505 --> 29:17.553
Well, I-I'm just glad
this hasn't escalated

29:17.554 --> 29:20.713
into an international incident.

29:22.883 --> 29:24.951
- Thank God.
- Hey.

29:24.952 --> 29:26.419
What's happening?

29:26.420 --> 29:29.222
Mr. Hobbs, this
is my fiancé, Jareth.

29:29.223 --> 29:32.092
He dropped by because, um,

29:32.093 --> 29:33.326
he wanted to meet you.

29:33.327 --> 29:34.928
Have a seat, young man.

29:34.929 --> 29:36.963
Let's talk about how you find poetry

29:36.964 --> 29:39.733
a waste of time and brain cells.

29:39.734 --> 29:42.369
I overheard her conversation
on the phone with you.

29:42.370 --> 29:45.772
I don't know why people think
alcohol affects auditory nerves.

29:45.773 --> 29:47.207
Please have a drink

29:47.208 --> 29:50.510
and, explain the
futility of verse to me.

29:50.511 --> 29:51.912
I don't think it's futile.

29:51.913 --> 29:55.148
Sometimes it can be ever so slightly...

29:55.149 --> 29:57.751
indulgent.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.520
Unnecessarily convoluted and redundant.

30:00.521 --> 30:03.423
Also pretentious, arrogant,

30:03.424 --> 30:05.792
and not essential to
the evolution of mankind.

30:05.793 --> 30:08.061
Otherwise a perfectly harmless pursuit.

30:08.062 --> 30:09.229
Should we go?

30:09.230 --> 30:11.998
With what do you occupy
your superior gray matter?

30:11.999 --> 30:13.767
I'm a physicist.

30:13.768 --> 30:16.136
Ha! Bravo.

30:16.137 --> 30:19.062
The geniuses who brought
us nuclear weapons,

30:20.007 --> 30:21.374
space junk and global warming.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.677
- Well done.
- What a charming oversimplification.

30:23.678 --> 30:26.379
Tell me something, how do you live

30:26.380 --> 30:31.017
with such an unimaginative
reductionist view of the world?

30:31.018 --> 30:34.721
How is life, without
the resonance of beauty,

30:34.722 --> 30:35.855
even worth the effort?

30:35.856 --> 30:38.458
Let me tell you a little
something about beauty,

30:38.459 --> 30:39.199
Mr. Hobbs.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.061
You seem to think I
can't appreciate beauty

30:41.062 --> 30:44.164
because I study the
intricacies of its components.

30:44.165 --> 30:46.533
You know what? Why don't we just go?

30:46.534 --> 30:47.467
Bartender?

30:47.468 --> 30:49.069
It was Richard Feynman, physicist,

30:49.070 --> 30:51.204
personal hero of mine, who put it best.

30:51.205 --> 30:54.407
He said that he could appreciate
the beauty of a flower more

30:54.408 --> 30:56.343
than, say, you.

30:56.344 --> 30:59.412
He said he could see more
than the average man sees.

30:59.413 --> 31:01.832
He could imagine its
cells, he could appreciate

31:01.833 --> 31:04.150
that the flower evolved
in order to make its colors

31:04.151 --> 31:05.518
more attractive to insects.

31:05.519 --> 31:07.420
Which means that insects see color.

31:07.421 --> 31:09.889
I mean, maybe they share
our aesthetic sense.

31:09.890 --> 31:12.459
Recognizing the majesty
of the quantum world

31:12.460 --> 31:13.927
only adds to the beauty of life.

31:13.928 --> 31:15.128
It does not subtract.

31:15.129 --> 31:16.696
So to answer your question, Mr. Hobbs,

31:16.697 --> 31:19.399
I don't just live in a beautiful world,

31:19.400 --> 31:21.533
I understand it.

31:30.131 --> 31:32.118
We're in a difficult spot here, Russell.

31:32.119 --> 31:35.272
Your legal options in fighting this case

31:35.273 --> 31:37.975
are extremely limited.

31:37.976 --> 31:39.676
If they rule in Evans' favor,

31:39.677 --> 31:41.779
there's very little we can do.

31:41.780 --> 31:45.381
Short of asserting
power by military junta.

31:46.884 --> 31:49.019
What if you tried reasoning with Evans?

31:49.020 --> 31:50.554
We tried that.

31:50.555 --> 31:52.990
We even offered him
Secretary of Commerce.

31:52.991 --> 31:54.658
He turned it down.

31:54.659 --> 31:56.860
Well... What can I tell
you? He's a motivated guy.

31:56.861 --> 31:59.696
He's a sore-loser law unto himself.

31:59.697 --> 32:02.733
Give me odds on the ruling.

32:02.734 --> 32:04.835
60-40, us.

32:04.836 --> 32:07.938
Nothing we can really do but hang tight.

32:07.939 --> 32:09.907
Okay, thanks.

32:09.908 --> 32:12.174
I guess.

32:22.486 --> 32:25.589
Go back to the breath.

32:29.426 --> 32:31.094
"Serenity," stream.

32:38.803 --> 32:41.171
Nothing to be done.

32:41.172 --> 32:45.042
Let the chips fall where they may.

32:45.043 --> 32:46.876
Breathe.

32:56.587 --> 32:59.389
Chips fall...

32:59.390 --> 33:02.259
What the hell?

33:02.260 --> 33:04.828
Who am I?

33:04.829 --> 33:06.864
Adele!

33:06.865 --> 33:09.199
Get me my file on Sam Evans.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.902
It's time to take out the trash.

33:11.903 --> 33:13.406
What if we just buy the horse?

33:13.407 --> 33:14.738
Let her live at the farm?

33:14.739 --> 33:17.242
That way it's a purchase, not a
bribe. And that's legal, right?

33:17.243 --> 33:20.611
Yes, it is, and that
was my first thought.

33:20.612 --> 33:22.346
The horse costs $2 million.

33:22.347 --> 33:23.680
My God.

33:23.681 --> 33:24.882
Does it sing and dance?

33:24.883 --> 33:26.817
Besides, even buying it

33:26.818 --> 33:28.585
looks like I'm taking sides

33:28.586 --> 33:30.654
on the referendum.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.189
I spent an hour on the phone

33:32.190 --> 33:33.957
with the Russian foreign minister,

33:33.958 --> 33:36.493
stepping out the
consequences of interfering

33:36.494 --> 33:38.128
with the democratic process.

33:38.129 --> 33:40.931
So I can't give them any ammunition.

33:40.932 --> 33:42.733
To knock you off your high horse.

33:43.801 --> 33:45.936
That was right there.
I had to, that was...

33:45.937 --> 33:47.271
It's the only one you get.

33:47.272 --> 33:49.840
Is Stevie at Jareth's? I
haven't seen her around.

33:49.841 --> 33:51.475
Yeah, she told us not to expect her.

33:51.476 --> 33:55.045
Think I could call
and just check on her,

33:55.046 --> 33:57.080
make sure she got in okay?

33:57.081 --> 33:58.382
At her fiancé's place?

33:58.383 --> 34:00.149
Helicoptery, right?

34:01.418 --> 34:02.452
Hey.

34:02.453 --> 34:04.154
It took a while, but I found your dress.

34:05.356 --> 34:06.790
I saw it in French Vogue

34:06.791 --> 34:09.458
and the stylist finally tracked it down.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.960
It's an Andre Devereaux,

34:10.962 --> 34:13.897
who is a totally cutting edge designer.

34:13.898 --> 34:15.732
No one else will be wearing it.

34:17.435 --> 34:20.170
That is really something, isn't it?

34:20.170 --> 34:22.572
- It is.
- You love it, right?

34:22.574 --> 34:23.907
I-I've...

34:23.908 --> 34:26.842
never seen anything like
it. It's just... every color.

34:26.844 --> 34:28.011
Ooh! Want to try it on?

34:28.012 --> 34:29.279
Tomorrow, baby.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.248
I-I'm so tired, and...

34:31.248 --> 34:34.117
Yeah. I'll have all of your
accessories by then, anyways.

34:34.118 --> 34:36.453
- There's more. Just gonna...
- Love you.

34:36.454 --> 34:38.654
Good night.

34:40.389 --> 34:41.992
I can't wear that, right?

34:41.993 --> 34:44.027
I don't think so.

34:44.027 --> 34:46.897
But she'll be
so disappointed and...

34:46.898 --> 34:49.433
Babe, this is not the
lanyard she made for you

34:49.434 --> 34:51.101
in the second grade. This is your dress

34:51.101 --> 34:52.536
for the inaugural ball.

34:52.536 --> 34:54.670
You got to seem...

34:54.672 --> 34:57.206
you know... sane.

34:58.775 --> 35:00.877
Stop trying to figure out

35:00.878 --> 35:04.281
how to make it work.

35:04.282 --> 35:06.350
Okay, then I'm calling Stevie.

35:08.553 --> 35:11.088
Hello. Hey, Mom!

35:11.089 --> 35:12.422
Wine.

35:12.423 --> 35:13.890
What's up?

35:15.026 --> 35:16.860
I was just calling to
see how your day was.

35:16.861 --> 35:17.928
Are you at Jareth's?

35:17.929 --> 35:20.364
Not yet. Um, we're just hanging out.

35:20.365 --> 35:22.332
Actually, I
need to get back to that.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.067
I-I'll call you later, okay?

35:24.068 --> 35:25.771
- But everything's fine.
- Good.

35:25.772 --> 35:27.605
Okay. Bye.

35:29.006 --> 35:30.829
Okay. We need to roll him on his side,
Yeah.

35:30.830 --> 35:32.797
- So he doesn't choke on his own vomit.
- What?

35:34.044 --> 35:36.580
Nothing. Love you.

35:36.581 --> 35:39.349
All good. Bye.

35:39.350 --> 35:41.351
I admire your discipline, Russell.

35:41.352 --> 35:43.587
That is the saddest looking
plate I've ever seen.

35:43.588 --> 35:45.589
You know what?

35:45.590 --> 35:48.792
Turns out I like fish. And kale.

35:48.793 --> 35:51.061
Now I get what
everybody's talking about.

35:51.062 --> 35:52.829
What are you looking
to sell me on tonight?

35:52.830 --> 35:54.613
'Cause I'm not buying
that lame cabinet post.

35:54.614 --> 35:55.999
No, not a thing.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.235
And the job offer's
no longer on the table.

35:58.236 --> 36:00.937
You looked that horse a
little too long in the mouth.

36:00.938 --> 36:02.205
See, the president

36:02.206 --> 36:04.241
doesn't know I'm here.

36:04.242 --> 36:06.777
Neither does the secretary.

36:06.778 --> 36:09.713
'Cause they're both
more principled people

36:09.714 --> 36:11.680
than I am.

36:13.950 --> 36:18.055
"In peace there is
nothing so becomes a man

36:18.056 --> 36:19.656
"as modest stillness

36:19.657 --> 36:21.390
"and humility.

36:22.726 --> 36:25.962
"But when the blast of
war blows in our ears,

36:25.963 --> 36:29.932
then imitate the actions of the tiger."

36:31.201 --> 36:34.705
Henry V.

36:34.706 --> 36:37.274
We, got our hands
on some oppo research

36:37.275 --> 36:39.538
that could have influenced
the narrative of the election,

36:39.539 --> 36:42.679
and the president decided not to use it.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.181
He still feels that way.

36:44.182 --> 36:47.517
Even I had a moment on the
high road, but it turns out,

36:47.518 --> 36:51.221
it's not really my thing.

36:51.222 --> 36:54.424
'Cause I can't stand seeing
good people being hurt

36:54.425 --> 36:58.161
because of unbridled greed and ambition.

36:58.162 --> 37:00.564
So I want you to think
about this, Governor.

37:00.565 --> 37:02.966
Imagine if you held the country up

37:02.967 --> 37:05.769
in an elaborate legal proceeding,

37:05.770 --> 37:08.038
rattled their faith in the system,

37:08.039 --> 37:09.940
even got yourself in office,

37:09.941 --> 37:13.376
only for the voting public to discover

37:13.377 --> 37:16.346
that you withheld information

37:16.347 --> 37:19.282
pertinent to your competency

37:19.283 --> 37:23.085
to be president of the United States.

37:26.857 --> 37:29.091
You're bluffing.

37:30.827 --> 37:33.630
You're welcome to try me.

37:41.489 --> 37:44.075
As the president and
members of his administration

37:44.076 --> 37:46.064
prepare for the inauguration ceremony,

37:46.065 --> 37:49.292
we've just received confirmation
that Governor Sam Evans

37:49.293 --> 37:51.110
has officially dropped his lawsuit

37:51.111 --> 37:52.644
against the state of Ohio.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.113
After much consideration and prayer,

37:55.114 --> 37:58.950
I've decided the best thing
for this country is to move on.

37:58.951 --> 38:01.620
Maintaining the Republic
and focusing on my work

38:01.621 --> 38:03.655
in the great state of Pennsylvania

38:03.656 --> 38:05.590
is of far greater importance

38:05.591 --> 38:07.559
than continuing to fight
this decision in court.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.295
I'll be taking no questions. Thank you.

38:10.296 --> 38:11.630
What do you know?

38:11.631 --> 38:15.766
Four Horsemen can't be far behind.

38:19.638 --> 38:21.173
What are you doing?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.140
God.

38:25.110 --> 38:26.745
Noodle, I'm so sorry. I just...

38:26.746 --> 38:29.047
I can't wear the dress
that you picked out.

38:29.048 --> 38:30.782
It's beautiful. It works great

38:30.783 --> 38:32.646
on somebody else, but I
just can't pull it off.

38:32.647 --> 38:34.019
And so I went back into my closet

38:34.020 --> 38:37.422
and I-I found these two,
just... so much more me...

38:37.423 --> 38:38.490
Thank God.

38:38.491 --> 38:39.624
What?

38:39.625 --> 38:41.426
I woke up in the middle of the night

38:41.427 --> 38:43.929
and I just totally started panicking.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.798
It's the inaugural ball, not the VMAs.

38:46.799 --> 38:49.234
Suddenly, I pictured you
on some Worst Dressed list

38:49.235 --> 38:52.704
next to Miley Cyrus, and it
would've been all my fault.

38:52.705 --> 38:56.308
I'm just so happy that you're not upset.

38:56.309 --> 38:59.578
It was sweet of you to trust
me with such a big decision,

38:59.579 --> 39:01.446
I just... I wasn't ready.

39:01.447 --> 39:03.381
- Well...
- For your inauguration?

39:03.382 --> 39:05.050
I will be.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.685
That's very funny. In the meantime,

39:06.686 --> 39:08.253
Which one of these do you like?

39:08.254 --> 39:10.155
The blue one.

39:10.156 --> 39:12.958
That's exactly what I think.

39:12.959 --> 39:14.726
The blue one.

39:27.873 --> 39:29.640
Mr. Hobbs?

39:32.777 --> 39:35.079
Are you here?

39:37.182 --> 39:39.417
Jareth, wake up. He's gone.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.353
- What?
- Mr. Hobbs is gone.

39:41.354 --> 39:43.288
- He's disappeared.
- All right, take it easy.

39:43.289 --> 39:45.390
I can't! It's the day
of the inauguration,

39:45.391 --> 39:47.759
and I have lost the poet laureate.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.061
Russell is gonna die.

39:50.062 --> 39:52.030
He could actually die. My God.

39:52.031 --> 39:54.132
Good morning, children.

39:54.133 --> 39:56.567
I've got cappuccinos all around.

39:58.103 --> 40:00.005
Um... Are you okay?

40:00.006 --> 40:01.139
Glorious.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.141
Got down to business at the coffee shop,

40:03.142 --> 40:04.209
finished the poem.

40:04.210 --> 40:07.244
I work better under pressure. Cruller?

40:08.013 --> 40:10.215
Ooh.

40:14.358 --> 40:15.425
There he is.

40:15.426 --> 40:17.161
- Bess.
- Congratulations.

40:17.162 --> 40:18.428
- Henry.
- Mr. President.

40:18.429 --> 40:19.797
Well, that was a cinch,
wasn't it? Getting here.

40:19.798 --> 40:21.198
- Piece of cake.
- Like butter.

40:21.199 --> 40:22.933
Barely felt it myself.

40:22.934 --> 40:24.935
Henry. A word?

40:24.936 --> 40:29.506
Warren Lee has agreed to help
us break into the bomber's phone.

40:29.507 --> 40:30.707
What'd you do?

40:30.708 --> 40:34.011
I told him about the system
we use to develop assets.

40:35.246 --> 40:37.147
Money, ideology, coercion.

40:37.148 --> 40:39.783
Actually, the system is MICE.

40:39.784 --> 40:44.221
With an "E." The fourth approach
is appealing to the asset's ego.

40:44.222 --> 40:48.691
I failed to mention that when
I told him he was our only hope.

40:49.426 --> 40:51.261
Okay.

40:51.262 --> 40:53.430
Mr. President.

40:53.431 --> 40:54.531
Congratulations, sir.

40:54.532 --> 40:56.053
- Thank you, Nadine.
- Congratulations.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.554
- Blake.
- Pardon me for interrupting,

40:57.555 --> 40:59.136
but there is news from Mongolia.

40:59.137 --> 41:00.804
The referendum vote came in.

41:00.805 --> 41:03.640
They voted to remain independent.

41:03.641 --> 41:06.276
That's a good thing.

41:06.277 --> 41:07.544
Now, about the horse.

41:07.545 --> 41:08.779
Mandy. Her name is Mandy.

41:08.780 --> 41:11.014
We found a suitable home for...

41:11.015 --> 41:12.049
Mandy.

41:12.050 --> 41:14.151
Cuba has agreed to take her.

41:14.152 --> 41:16.420
Their laws around importing livestock

41:16.421 --> 41:18.355
are still in a nascent stage.

41:18.356 --> 41:20.157
At first, I worried the
climate was too warm,

41:20.158 --> 41:21.959
but the vibe there is so great.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.026
Well, that's a relief.

41:23.027 --> 41:25.562
Thanks, guys. Love it
when it all works out.

41:25.563 --> 41:27.297
What? The, the Evans thing?

41:27.298 --> 41:30.433
No. But since you brought it up...

41:31.168 --> 41:33.503
Any idea what happened there?

41:33.504 --> 41:38.008
I guess the chips
just fell our way, sir.

41:38.009 --> 41:42.145
Sitting high above the Potomac swamp,

41:42.146 --> 41:44.681
in the long shadow of
the spilt blood and dreams

41:44.682 --> 41:46.984
of the Founding Fathers
and Founding Mothers,

41:46.985 --> 41:51.488
I can see more than
the average man sees.

41:51.489 --> 41:56.360
I imagine the cells,
the nucleus of things.

41:56.361 --> 41:58.962
I see colors that evolved

41:58.963 --> 42:01.498
to speak to the smallest of eyes.

42:01.499 --> 42:04.201
Sacrifices that meet in this cataclysm

42:04.202 --> 42:08.005
of longing for what can and what can,

42:08.006 --> 42:09.806
overcoming what cannot.

42:09.807 --> 42:12.976
In the majesty of the quantum world,

42:12.977 --> 42:15.412
in the beauty of building blocks,

42:15.413 --> 42:17.581
in the tiniest of elements,

42:17.582 --> 42:21.618
I glimpse the privilege of being.

42:21.619 --> 42:26.256
This alertness does
not subtract. It adds.

42:26.257 --> 42:30.093
It is not our inheritance
merely to abide

42:30.094 --> 42:32.262
in this beautiful world.

42:32.263 --> 42:34.831
It is our inheritance

42:34.832 --> 42:37.301
to understand it.
