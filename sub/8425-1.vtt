We heard her talking
to the agent.

this great garden spot?

a mom who cares

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:31.440

in you than his own thing.

if I was the best on the team

he might wanna stick around
some, you know?

to be better than your sister,

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.520

to live up to

how come you stopped?
