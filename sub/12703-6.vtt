those hyenas from Africa.

There was something strange
about them from day one.

33:17.472 --> 33:19.039

That particular breed
is very rare.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.435

could've happened to your kids.

33:35.838 --> 33:37.231
We don't know exactly
how the ritual works.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.930
We know that it involves
a-a-a predatory act

33:39.973 --> 33:41.236
