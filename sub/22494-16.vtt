00:18.184 --> 00:20.790
It's alive!

00:38.371 --> 00:39.782
Gentlemen, what you're
about to see

00:39.839 --> 00:41.819
must not leave this room.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.253
Dallas, 1963!

00:44.310 --> 00:45.448
There is a cat!

00:45.512 --> 00:47.014
Moscow, 1991!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.525
There is a cat!

00:48.581 --> 00:50.060
Here are some stairs!

00:50.116 --> 00:51.424
There is a cat!

00:51.484 --> 00:53.225
New Orleans, 2005!

00:53.286 --> 00:54.856
There is a cat!

00:54.921 --> 00:57.697
So what we're seeing is that
we're being observed...

00:57.757 --> 01:00.033
or manipulated...
by a cat.

01:00.093 --> 01:01.731
Or a number of cats.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.773
What can we do about it?

01:02.829 --> 01:04.331
Nothing!

01:04.397 --> 01:08.038
You can do nothing!

01:13.907 --> 01:16.513
Goodbye, Harry!

01:19.913 --> 01:22.553
Oh my God!
Are you okay?

01:25.485 --> 01:27.624
Oh, hi, you're awake.
I'm Sally Williams.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.325
Sorry about hitting you.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.034
And then my second boyfriend
ever, Lorenzo,

01:32.092 --> 01:33.469
what an egomaniac.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.267
I mean all he cared about was
Lacrosse.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.205
Why don't guys
call you back the next day?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.799
I mean, I am so
tired of playing games.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.736
Okay, you know what
makes me laugh...

01:41.801 --> 01:44.008
how guys don't know when women
are faking orgasms.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.740
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

01:54.547 --> 01:55.651
Whoa! Okay whoa!

01:55.715 --> 01:58.218
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
you're okay, it's okay.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.628
Easy now, relax.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.689
And what will you have?
- I'm good.

02:02.755 --> 02:04.792
So we've been
married for 10 years.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.235
A lot of my friends think
it's weird,

02:06.292 --> 02:07.669
me fucking a Bigfoot.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.866
But love is blind, right?

02:09.929 --> 02:12.876
You're... you're not gonna eat
that meatball sandwich

02:12.932 --> 02:14.673
out in the open are you?
Be carefu...

02:24.844 --> 02:27.654
Oh, she's just so precious!
Who's precious?

02:27.714 --> 02:28.988
You are!

03:00.513 --> 03:05.326
See you jizzbags later!

03:05.385 --> 03:08.389
When "Lord of the Rings" author
JRR Tolkien passed on,

03:08.454 --> 03:10.491
many thought
Middle Earth had come to an end.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.436
But recently researchers found
a half-finished manuscript.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.063
A sequel
to "Lord of the Rings."

03:15.128 --> 03:17.005
When, on direct orders
from Tolkien's will,

03:17.063 --> 03:20.601
his 6-year-old grandson,
JRR Tolkien Junior Junior,

03:20.667 --> 03:22.442
finished the novel
and the movie was made,

03:22.502 --> 03:25.278
fans hoped Middle Earth
would rise again.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.012
Here now we present a never
before-seen sneak-peak

03:28.074 --> 03:30.850
of "Lord of the Rings:
The Final Journey."

03:33.346 --> 03:36.020
Oh, Merry, I miss
Mr. Frodo already.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.425
Me too, Pippin.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.656
Frodo was a dear, dear friend.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.357
I like to eat poop.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.456
Hey, look, it's Gandalf!

03:43.923 --> 03:46.267
Merry, Pippin.
We are not safe.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.636
A dark menace rises
to the East.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.369
Duckies go 'quack'.
Cows go 'moooo'.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.707
I want ice cream.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.610
Verily, will you Hobbits
join my quest?

03:56.669 --> 03:58.273
Yes, Mr. Gandalf.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.181
What about you, Hannah Montana?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.346
<i>♪ I like macaroni and cheese ♪</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:05.252
I want poop!

04:05.311 --> 04:07.951
These F-16s will take us as far
as the Erendor River,

04:08.014 --> 04:10.722
then we will have to find
the Bridge of Larakaei.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.229
Quickly! Everyone make jet
noises with your mouth.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.560
Moooo!

04:23.162 --> 04:25.836
The three-headed Peanut Butter
and Jelly Monster

04:25.898 --> 04:27.809
is too powerful.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.973
And I like to eat poop...
poop poop, poop poop...

04:31.037 --> 04:33.381
I don't want to do my homework.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.316
Let's all sing
"The Muffin Man!"

04:35.375 --> 04:36.945

04:57.163 --> 04:58.233
Agh! Get it off!

05:56.823 --> 05:58.825
My name is Murray

05:58.891 --> 06:01.030
and ain't nobody gonna tell me

06:01.094 --> 06:02.198
how to conjugate verbs!

06:08.968 --> 06:11.073
Hi, I'm Steve.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.741
Hey, Rachel.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.307
So what's your major?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.546
Philosophy.

06:15.608 --> 06:19.784
Oh, lots of demand for that
in the workplace, huh?

06:19.846 --> 06:21.086
Clear the area!

06:21.147 --> 06:22.649
This is Hurt Locker.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.319
Got a guy just stepped
on a land mine.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.864
Actually, my father had
a philosophy degree.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.160
Okay buddy, just stay calm.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.364
Oh, he must be
very proud of you.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.905
That's it. Steady.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.133
Actually, he's dead.

06:36.195 --> 06:39.005
Oh, my God, it's clicked
and ready to blow!

06:39.065 --> 06:40.669
I've only seconds
to diffuse this!

06:40.733 --> 06:43.407
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Good.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.107
It must have been hard.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.650
Hang in there.
Hang on.

06:46.706 --> 06:47.810
How did he die?

06:47.874 --> 06:50.150
He couldn't get a job
and he killed himself.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.815
Don't you fucking move, man!

06:57.049 --> 06:58.687
I'm sorry man, I'm sorry!

06:58.751 --> 07:00.230
I just wasn't good enough.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.594
What?

07:04.724 --> 07:12.404
Nooooooooooo!

07:18.237 --> 07:21.309
Get back!!!

07:24.076 --> 07:26.488
Rock Biter?
I've lost my Luck Dragon and...

07:26.546 --> 07:30.358
They look like big,
strong hands, don't they?

07:30.416 --> 07:32.259
That's what I always thought.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.093
But my little friends...

07:34.153 --> 07:35.894
I couldn't hold onto them.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.060
That's terrible,
but Falcor needs me, and I...

07:38.124 --> 07:40.570
The Nothing pulled them
right out of my hands.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.233
My big, strong, good hands...

07:44.297 --> 07:46.800
You know, the more you talk
about how great your hands are

07:46.866 --> 07:48.311
the harder it is to believe

07:48.367 --> 07:49.937
you couldn't hold on
to your friends...

07:50.002 --> 07:53.677
I was hoping the soliloquy
about my hands

07:53.739 --> 07:56.379
would keep you from asking
any questions.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.046
Yeah, I was almost
getting choked up,

07:58.110 --> 07:59.987
but then I was like, "Whaaaat?

08:00.046 --> 08:02.526
Rock Biter's talking way too
much about his hands yo."

08:02.582 --> 08:04.061
They all bullied me pretty bad.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.596
Replace the "R"
in my name with a "C"

08:06.652 --> 08:09.030
and you're getting a good idea
of what I put up with.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.329
I didn't even try to hold on
to them actually,

08:11.390 --> 08:13.631
I just watched them and waved.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.003
I don't have time
for a Neverending Story.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.838
Ha ha. Good one.
High Five.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.343
Not on your life.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.742
Uh, meow. I need a gun.

nine bullets. Meow.
