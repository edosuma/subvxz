00:00.338 --> 00:01.338
<i>Sports Illustrated has this team</i>

00:01.339 --> 00:03.291
<i>as the number one high school
football team in Texas.</i>

00:03.292 --> 00:05.288
Got yourself a heck
of a quarterback.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.138
He's a good boy.
Very proud of him.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.704
Is it true, Mr. Street,
that--

00:08.717 --> 00:09.607
That I love Lyla Garrity?

00:09.673 --> 00:11.940
Here's to God and football

00:12.007 --> 00:13.673
and, ten years
from now, Street,

00:13.740 --> 00:15.940
good friends livin' large
in Texas.

00:16.008 --> 00:17.040
We feel fully prepared

00:17.100 --> 00:19.005
to represent
this beloved community

00:19.075 --> 00:20.049
this Friday night

00:20.108 --> 00:21.078
and every Friday night.

00:21.149 --> 00:23.171
You've earned this.
The right to win.

00:23.248 --> 00:24.812
<i>Street throws a wobble.</i>

00:24.827 --> 00:25.603
Picked off by Chandler.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.972
Street the only one
that can get to him.

00:28.387 --> 00:30.053
Gigantic hit on Street.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.183
A third-string quarterback.
Saracen!

00:34.188 --> 00:34.981
No one's seen
this guy play.

00:35.178 --> 00:36.231
Start throwing
the ball, son.

00:36.677 --> 00:37.422
<i>Dropping back to pass,</i>

00:37.785 --> 00:39.341
and he throws the ball--
Oh, man.

00:39.597 --> 00:40.903
Man, can this kid
throw the ball.

00:41.426 --> 00:43.543
Give all of us
the strength to remember

00:43.605 --> 00:44.570
that what we have
is special.

00:44.935 --> 00:47.000
That it can be taken
from us.

00:47.078 --> 00:48.842
And that when it is,
we will be tested.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.223
It is a blessing

00:52.226 --> 00:53.502
to be in the house
of the Lord

00:53.508 --> 00:54.560
amongst believers.

00:54.578 --> 00:55.760
Amen.

00:55.777 --> 00:57.133
We do know
that on Friday night,

00:57.135 --> 00:59.231
one of our brothers,
brother Jason,

00:59.237 --> 01:02.562
was injured
in the football game.

01:02.605 --> 01:03.602
The doctors are saying

01:03.608 --> 01:05.580
that possible
he could be paralyzed.

01:05.677 --> 01:09.001
But we know of a doctor
who's greater

01:09.078 --> 01:10.742
than any doctor.

01:10.806 --> 01:12.743
Yes, yes.

01:12.808 --> 01:17.042
I have prayed with Mitchell
and Joanne Street.

01:17.105 --> 01:19.601
And as an entire
community,

01:19.677 --> 01:23.801
we have come together
in prayer and hope.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.542
And faith

01:26.608 --> 01:29.243
And with these prayers,
this faith,

01:29.308 --> 01:32.403
this hope,
I believe Jason Street

01:33.667 --> 01:36.243
will once again walk in
on his own two feet

01:37.497 --> 01:39.691
and join
this congregation

01:39.766 --> 01:41.990
and rejoice with us.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.632
I saw that tackle,
little brother.

01:44.697 --> 01:47.661
I saw him hit that turf.

01:47.735 --> 01:50.063
Tell you what I think.

01:50.138 --> 01:53.163
He's talking about wanting
to play football.

01:53.236 --> 01:54.762
He ain't ever
gonna walk again.

01:56.836 --> 01:58.362
And we know
he's gonna be fine.

01:58.436 --> 01:59.331
He's gonna walk again.

02:00.837 --> 02:03.260
We're prayin' for him.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.061
Best case scenario,
Jason's probably out

02:11.136 --> 02:12.462
for a month.

02:12.538 --> 02:14.430
You know, it's probably
a lot longer than that.

02:15.568 --> 02:19.260
But, uh, we need a plan
for Friday night.

02:19.336 --> 02:20.533
Heck, we--

02:20.597 --> 02:23.091
Heck, we need a--need a plan
for the rest of the season,

02:23.166 --> 02:24.591
is what we need, Eric.

02:26.528 --> 02:27.191
So tell me,

02:27.268 --> 02:31.293
you think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

02:37.788 --> 02:39.320
I guess we're fixin'
to find out.

02:39.697 --> 02:40.460
Yep.

02:40.465 --> 02:43.003
That was a nice sermon,
wasn't it?

02:43.967 --> 02:45.061
Hey, Matt.

02:45.136 --> 02:46.862
Come here.

02:48.366 --> 02:50.802
How's it goin', Coach?

02:50.868 --> 02:53.100
We got a lotta work
to do, son.

02:54.907 --> 02:56.003
Yes sir.

03:49.035 --> 03:50.603
Hey, Lyla.
Hi.

03:50.935 --> 03:53.230
There he is.

03:53.308 --> 03:54.260
How you doing?

03:54.335 --> 03:55.762
Better now.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.233
You ever hear
of Nathan Foreman?

03:58.306 --> 03:58.803
Who?

03:58.807 --> 03:59.743
Scuse me, doc.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.821
Can you come help me
with this, please?

04:01.826 --> 04:04.062
Just grab this side,
please.

04:04.126 --> 04:05.362
Have you ever heard
of Nathan Foreman?

04:05.426 --> 04:06.390
Uh, no.

04:06.465 --> 04:08.092
I was on the Internet
last night

04:08.165 --> 04:09.363
reading about this guy.

04:09.427 --> 04:10.323
Had a terrible
spinal injury,

04:10.395 --> 04:11.992
kinda like yours.

04:12.068 --> 04:12.962
He now playing
varsity basketball

04:13.026 --> 04:14.861
for UC San Diego.

04:14.925 --> 04:16.062
I'm surprised
you never heard of this.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.060
No, I'm--I'm oncology,
actually.

04:18.128 --> 04:19.761
I'm just--
I was just passing.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.892
Oh, right.

04:20.966 --> 04:21.822
Well, can you hold this
up for me, please,

04:21.898 --> 04:22.820
while I tape this?

04:22.895 --> 04:23.860
Thanks.

04:23.926 --> 04:24.861
Isn't this amazing?

04:24.927 --> 04:26.463
The cheerleaders
and rally girls

04:26.528 --> 04:29.420
have actually joined forces.

04:30.858 --> 04:31.360
It's real nice.

04:31.428 --> 04:32.462
Thanks so much.

04:32.527 --> 04:33.660
You know, Nathan Foreman

04:33.667 --> 04:35.320
missed one season,

04:35.397 --> 04:36.691
and the NCAA voted
to give him

04:36.697 --> 04:38.622
an extra year
of eligibility.

04:43.668 --> 04:44.620
Look at me, Jason.

04:46.727 --> 04:48.291
Look at me.

04:48.368 --> 04:50.791
This is gonna be okay.

04:50.866 --> 04:52.120
Yeah.

04:52.196 --> 04:53.660
Okay?

04:53.726 --> 04:54.962
Okay.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.060
I love you.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.160
I love you, too.

05:00.626 --> 05:03.591
<i> Well, there's no silver lining
to this one.</i>

05:03.668 --> 05:06.613
<i> This is just a tragic blow
to the season,</i>

05:06.617 --> 05:07.061
<i>any way you slice it.</i>

05:07.875 --> 05:09.543
<i> Jason Street is the Panthers.</i>

05:09.615 --> 05:11.543
<i> The team's been built
around him.</i>

05:11.616 --> 05:15.242
<i>Now you've got this kid,
this 160-pound sophomore?</i>

05:15.315 --> 05:16.443
<i> Matt Sorenson?</i>

05:16.515 --> 05:17.713
They didn't even get
your name right.

05:17.776 --> 05:18.673
<i> I think he just closed his eyes</i>

05:18.748 --> 05:19.672
<i> and threw that ball.</i>

05:19.747 --> 05:20.970
<i> The kid comes in</i>

05:21.048 --> 05:22.442
<i>with three minutes left
in the fourth quarter.</i>

05:22.518 --> 05:23.970
<i> With that nd
of adrenaline rush,</i>

05:24.045 --> 05:25.640
<i> anyone can throw
one nice pass.</i>

05:25.716 --> 05:27.441
<i>Well, Hawk says you better</i>

05:27.517 --> 05:29.910
<i>go to church
and do a little prayin.</i>

05:37.418 --> 05:38.671
We're still waitin' to hear.

05:39.546 --> 05:42.201
They got a specialist's
comin' in from Houston.

05:43.156 --> 05:43.772
In the meantime,

05:45.036 --> 05:46.250
it doesn't make any sense

05:46.256 --> 05:47.940
and it does nobody any good

05:48.676 --> 05:50.320
to make any predictions
one way or the other

05:50.507 --> 05:51.533
until we get
the official word.

05:51.636 --> 05:52.570
Understood?

05:52.638 --> 05:54.572
Yes, sir.

05:54.635 --> 05:56.572
As far as football,

05:56.636 --> 05:57.902
we got a game Friday.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.100
We got a lotta work
to do.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.205
Ready?

06:03.275 --> 06:04.539
Break.

06:04.608 --> 06:05.478
Let's go, one!

06:05.539 --> 06:06.901
Number two!

06:06.977 --> 06:08.101
Two, two, two,
two, two.

06:08.176 --> 06:09.471
Set!

06:09.536 --> 06:10.833
Blue, eight.

06:10.908 --> 06:11.933
Blue, eight.

06:12.006 --> 06:13.802
Hut!

06:15.006 --> 06:16.330
Hit 'im deep!

06:16.407 --> 06:17.902
Hit 'im deep.

06:17.976 --> 06:18.931
Time!

06:19.005 --> 06:21.031
Matt, you gotta throw
faster, son.

06:21.107 --> 06:22.070
If Dolia's open
on the break,

06:22.137 --> 06:23.533
you gotta hit him
on the break.

06:23.608 --> 06:24.973
Sorry, Coach. I thought--
I don't want you
to say sorry.

06:25.046 --> 06:26.071
I don't want you
thinkin' out here.

06:26.138 --> 06:27.172
I want you to throw the ball.

06:27.236 --> 06:29.362
Dolia runs deep,
hit him deep.

06:29.546 --> 06:30.811
He's open on the break,
hit him on the break.

06:30.818 --> 06:32.113
You got four seconds
or a five-step drop, Matt!

06:32.176 --> 06:34.471
All right, come on.
Let's do it again.

06:34.546 --> 06:36.040
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:39.646 --> 06:41.013
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

06:41.077 --> 06:42.341
God's sakes, Matt!

06:42.416 --> 06:43.642
Come here.

06:43.717 --> 06:45.912
What happened?

06:45.978 --> 06:47.443
I-I didn't see the linebacker.
You didn't what?

06:47.518 --> 06:49.040
He's bigger than
my front door, Matt!

06:49.115 --> 06:50.963
South Milbank
runs a five-three.

06:50.966 --> 06:52.111
They're gonna drop
the linebackers.

06:52.116 --> 06:52.990
We set up in the gun.
You got that?

06:53.155 --> 06:54.180
All right, Coach.

06:54.258 --> 06:55.211
I gotta--I gotta work
on reading the cover--

06:55.286 --> 06:56.511
You need to look
at the wide receiver

06:56.586 --> 06:58.182
comin' underneath
the linebacker.
Yes, sir.

06:58.255 --> 07:00.250
Timing patterns.
Hit 'em on the breaks.

07:00.315 --> 07:02.880
Hit them on the breaks
and play faster.
Yes, sir.

07:02.955 --> 07:04.813
Hut!

07:07.555 --> 07:08.811
Saracen.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.451
I need you to work
a little bit harder.

07:13.518 --> 07:15.451
You need to learn
this offense, son.

07:15.516 --> 07:17.250
You need to know
this offense

07:17.317 --> 07:18.852
in your mind,
in your body.

07:18.915 --> 07:20.511
You need to know
this offense so well

07:20.588 --> 07:22.053
that your children
are gonna know this offense

07:22.117 --> 07:23.050
in their own DNA.

07:23.118 --> 07:24.013
Do you understand me?

07:24.086 --> 07:24.983
You understand?

07:25.057 --> 07:26.551
Yes, sir.

07:26.616 --> 07:27.881
All right.

07:27.955 --> 07:29.182
Go on.

07:31.786 --> 07:34.011
Okay, y'all, I'm outta here.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.581
I'm telling you, you shouldn't
go to this book club, Mom.

07:35.586 --> 07:36.711
They're just gonna turn you
into a pod.

07:36.718 --> 07:39.091
I know.

07:39.275 --> 07:40.271
I'm just gonna go
one time,

07:40.518 --> 07:42.681
show them my
literary prowess.

07:42.686 --> 07:45.180
And then I'll be done
with it.

07:45.245 --> 07:46.182
Hey, come here.

07:46.246 --> 07:47.140
Come here.

08:03.387 --> 08:04.512
I love you.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.341
I love you, too, babe.

08:47.848 --> 08:48.280
To the girls' night.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.643
Girls.
Cheers.

08:50.648 --> 08:53.901
We are thrilled that you're here
with our book club.

08:54.245 --> 08:55.140
Thank you.
I'm so excited to be here.

08:55.646 --> 08:56.641
I love the book.

08:56.715 --> 08:58.070
Oh, no.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.940
Oh, that's great.

09:00.016 --> 09:01.540
We don't really
read the book.

09:01.616 --> 09:02.910
Y'all didn't read the book?
We're just here to have fun.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.740
Tell me, how's your husband
feeling about the team?

09:05.815 --> 09:07.541
Exactly, let's talk
about what's important.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.472
He's--he lo--
he's, um--

09:09.546 --> 09:10.671
excited about the team.

09:10.748 --> 09:11.713
Well, you know,
are you sure?

09:11.776 --> 09:13.272
Listen.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.140
He should play
my Robbie D. more.
What he should be doin'--

09:15.218 --> 09:16.842
He should be
running more dives

09:16.916 --> 09:18.140
than counters straight ahead.

09:18.218 --> 09:20.140
Do you have any idea
what his plans are for Robbie?

09:20.217 --> 09:21.373
I don't.
Smash-mouth football.

09:21.448 --> 09:22.840
Smash-mouth football.

09:22.915 --> 09:24.412
Three yards
and a cloud of dust.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.571
This boy is ready
to rumble.

09:25.647 --> 09:28.442
So look,
you got my math homework?

09:28.515 --> 09:29.911
Where is it?
At my home.

09:29.975 --> 09:32.413
I gotta come to your house
and pick it up, huh?

09:32.478 --> 09:33.612
Well, you gonna be there?

09:33.675 --> 09:35.471
Of course.
Okay, all righty.

09:35.545 --> 09:36.871
All righty.

09:37.938 --> 09:38.411
Can't believe it.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.072
Just three days ago,
we were right here.

09:43.665 --> 09:46.730
Jason Street was literally
sitting right over there.

09:46.807 --> 09:48.031
Could they be more annoying?

09:48.107 --> 09:49.430
I mean, seriously.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.931
Hey.

09:51.006 --> 09:52.830
Hey, yeah, you.

09:52.905 --> 09:54.303
You don't even know
Jason Street.

09:54.377 --> 09:55.332
So stop crying.

09:56.807 --> 09:58.773
Okay, no.
Seriously, stop.

10:04.106 --> 10:06.373
So.

10:06.435 --> 10:07.563
Just how drunk
are you right now?

10:07.638 --> 10:09.001
Look, we can't--

10:09.076 --> 10:10.801
we can't just sit around
and cry about it.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.602
Somebody's gotta
take control.

10:12.666 --> 10:14.200
You know, like when one person
drops the ball,

10:14.277 --> 10:16.173
somebody's gotta jump
on the fumble.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.072
You pointin' at me.
That's me, right?

10:18.135 --> 10:19.202
That's you, man.

10:19.277 --> 10:20.773
That's me, baby.
I know what I gotta do.

10:20.835 --> 10:22.071
We can't afford
to lose this.

10:22.137 --> 10:23.801
This is ours.
I wanna get to state.

10:23.876 --> 10:25.932
Hey, Matt.

10:27.066 --> 10:27.900
So, I'm yours.

10:29.037 --> 10:30.571
S-sorry?

10:30.636 --> 10:31.900
Well, now that you're
first string,

10:31.968 --> 10:33.471
you get a first string
rally girl.

10:33.538 --> 10:35.532
So the way this
usually works is

10:35.607 --> 10:36.862
you tell me
what you like,

10:36.935 --> 10:38.503
and I'll provide it.

10:38.575 --> 10:39.531
What do you like, Matt?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.501
Uh, I don't--

10:41.575 --> 10:42.601
I like, um--

10:42.667 --> 10:43.932
I make a mean
chocolate coconut cake.

10:44.007 --> 10:45.471
Made with real butter.

10:45.538 --> 10:47.131
Well, that's--
that sounds--

10:47.206 --> 10:48.300
Tell you what.

10:48.366 --> 10:49.730
Why don't you try it,
see what you think,

10:49.808 --> 10:50.731
and we'll go from there.

10:50.805 --> 10:52.403
Yeah, that sounds good.

10:55.635 --> 10:57.701
Okay, can we just pause
for a second

10:57.765 --> 11:01.203
and reflect on the
implications of this?

11:01.268 --> 11:02.532
No, no, no.
I can--no.

11:02.607 --> 11:04.130
I can't think
about girls right now.

11:04.207 --> 11:05.703
'Cause I got
a big game on Friday, so--

11:05.706 --> 11:07.170
I mean, this is it.

11:07.178 --> 11:08.831
We gotta seize
our opportunity.

11:09.255 --> 11:10.421
I mean, you're QB1 now.

11:10.636 --> 11:11.522
You know, me and you.
Me and you?

11:11.865 --> 11:13.290
What do you even have
to do with it?

11:13.298 --> 11:15.792
Besides, it doesn't seem right
with Jason sittin' there

11:15.867 --> 11:17.661
in that hospital,
just layin' there and all.

11:17.725 --> 11:19.621
Well, maybe it's not right,
but it's what we got.

11:19.685 --> 11:20.720
You know?

11:20.798 --> 11:22.661
Four or five weeks,
he's back on the team.

11:22.726 --> 11:24.462
You're second string again.

11:24.527 --> 11:26.292
You know, the rally girls,
they pack up their little tent

11:26.366 --> 11:27.791
and they move
right down the road.

11:27.797 --> 11:28.950
You think this team
needs a leader?

11:28.965 --> 11:31.340
Yeah, it does, man.

11:31.347 --> 11:32.300
Look no further.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.640
I'm gonna lead this team.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.170
I know what I gotta do.

11:36.248 --> 11:37.702
Y'all gonna be wit' me?

11:37.776 --> 11:39.702
I'm gonna take us
straight to state.

11:39.776 --> 11:41.270
Just because Street
went down

11:41.345 --> 11:42.471
don't mean we just
stop playin'.

11:42.545 --> 11:43.473
Look.

11:43.548 --> 11:44.542
Everybody get behind
the Smash,

11:44.606 --> 11:46.910
and we won't miss
a beat, baby.

11:46.976 --> 11:48.673
Tim, no.

11:48.746 --> 11:51.440
Sit down.
Don't do this.

11:51.506 --> 11:53.042
I'm sayin' we need to hit
the weight room tomorrow hard.

11:53.115 --> 11:54.972
You gotta step it up.

11:55.045 --> 11:56.170
Look, you gotta run
your rocks.

11:56.246 --> 11:58.142
Hey, wassup, Rig?

11:58.216 --> 11:59.211
Get up.

11:59.278 --> 12:00.842
What?

12:00.916 --> 12:02.012
You're sittin'
in Street's booth.

12:02.076 --> 12:03.173
Get up.

12:03.248 --> 12:04.640
Look, what you talkin'
'bout, man?

12:04.707 --> 12:06.341
You heard what I said.

12:08.405 --> 12:09.771
Why don't you go home

12:09.847 --> 12:11.771
and sleep it off, Rig?

12:11.845 --> 12:13.941
Be on time at practice
for a change.

12:30.777 --> 12:31.971
You're right.

12:36.446 --> 12:38.442
You guys enjoy the rest
of your evening, okay?

12:42.048 --> 12:43.700
Hey, smile, Rig.

12:43.778 --> 12:45.840
God don't like ugly.

12:47.706 --> 12:48.942
Man, what's wrong with you?

12:49.017 --> 12:50.241
No, no.

12:50.305 --> 12:51.301
What's the matter with you?

12:52.716 --> 12:53.510
Go on, Riggins!

12:55.666 --> 12:57.610
No, I think it's a great case.

12:57.616 --> 12:59.491
Well, sure.

12:59.496 --> 13:03.163
I'd love to help out.

13:04.078 --> 13:07.200
All right i can do that

13:07.208 --> 13:09.680
Rice Krispie Treats?

13:12.446 --> 13:14.432
No, I th--I--
Rice Krisp Treats are great,

13:14.435 --> 13:15.831
and I do prefer 'em
with the M and Ms in.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.232
Yeah.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.071
I'll probably just make 'em
out of a box.

13:21.098 --> 13:22.631
Oh, that many?
It's broken.

13:22.697 --> 13:24.233
Okay.

13:24.298 --> 13:25.790
I would be happy
to do that, sure.

13:25.868 --> 13:27.960
All right, and thank you
so much again for last night.

13:28.035 --> 13:29.131
It was just wonderful.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.191
Okay.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.161
I'll talk to you later.

13:31.238 --> 13:32.363
Bye!

13:32.438 --> 13:33.960
I swear, I've gotta make
200 Rice Krispie Treats

13:34.038 --> 13:35.552
by Saturday.

13:36.058 --> 13:37.332
Went to that book club
meeting last night.

13:37.336 --> 13:38.502
I'm on 12 committees now.

13:38.505 --> 13:40.332
Told you.
It's a slippery slope.

13:41.837 --> 13:43.071
How's the AC?

13:43.136 --> 13:45.300
It's broken.
You were right.

13:45.377 --> 13:46.473
Call the guy.
I'm sorry.

13:46.538 --> 13:47.801
Sugar?

13:47.876 --> 13:51.131
I think it's time
for me to get a job.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.330
I mean,
we talked about it.

13:52.408 --> 13:54.270
We're settled.

13:54.336 --> 13:55.831
I think it's all right.

13:55.906 --> 13:57.003
You gonna do it now?

13:57.077 --> 13:58.732
Yeah, I think now.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.101
I'm gonna put out some feelers,
all right?

14:03.198 --> 14:03.501
All right.

14:03.507 --> 14:06.272
All right.
That's great.

14:06.286 --> 14:07.433
Nothin' you need
to worry about.

14:09.105 --> 14:10.901
Now, those boys,

14:10.906 --> 14:12.672
those boys
have always been weak

14:12.677 --> 14:13.322
against the run.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.002
And this year
is no different.

14:15.078 --> 14:17.771
They cannot defend
against the ground game.

14:17.848 --> 14:18.743
Am I right, Rich?

14:18.806 --> 14:19.842
That's exactly right.

14:19.908 --> 14:21.202
So it's simple.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.040
You give Smash the ball.

14:23.105 --> 14:24.202
You let him do
his thing.

14:24.275 --> 14:25.773
Yeah, and don't let Saracen
throw the ball.

14:25.848 --> 14:27.502
I know.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.473
We don't want
any more of our boys

14:29.548 --> 14:30.940
beaned in the helmet.

14:31.008 --> 14:32.273
That was funny.

14:32.345 --> 14:34.241
That boy can not
do the job.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.841
I mean, you can't just--

14:35.907 --> 14:37.401
You can't just sit back
and close your eyes

14:37.475 --> 14:38.441
and expect miracles
to happen

14:38.508 --> 14:39.503
every time you throw
the football.

14:39.576 --> 14:40.500
Just ain't gonna happen.

14:40.577 --> 14:41.970
That boy will lose
us ball games.

14:42.045 --> 14:43.303
Hey, now.

14:43.377 --> 14:46.071
Ease off on all these pearls
of football wisdom

14:46.075 --> 14:49.761
down there, and let Eric
finish his riblets.

14:50.755 --> 14:51.640
That's right.

14:52.005 --> 14:52.980
He's right.

14:53.567 --> 14:54.901
Uh-huh, because,
I mean,

14:54.967 --> 14:57.330
he knows what it takes
on Friday night.

14:57.407 --> 14:58.363
That's right.

14:58.436 --> 15:00.460
A big ol' W.

15:01.806 --> 15:04.603
You know,
I just wanna say...

15:04.915 --> 15:06.631
I'm gonna keep
all this in mind.

15:07.878 --> 15:09.710
And thank you very much
for this meal.

15:09.877 --> 15:11.203
This is a fantastic meal.

15:11.276 --> 15:12.712
Oh, it's our pleasure.
Fantastic meal.

15:15.307 --> 15:16.271
Ball, ball!

15:16.345 --> 15:17.271
Aww.

15:17.346 --> 15:18.942
Oh, for God's sakes,
Matt!

15:21.378 --> 15:21.923
Watch the way
you throw the ball!

15:21.928 --> 15:23.992
Don't you think we oughta start
focusing on our ground game?

15:23.996 --> 15:25.722
We give this kid too much
to think about,

15:25.795 --> 15:27.491
he's gonna fall apart
in front of our eyes.

15:27.557 --> 15:28.891
Big time.

15:28.957 --> 15:29.953
Let's go!
Thanks, Coach.

15:30.025 --> 15:31.551
I'll run the practice today.

15:32.697 --> 15:33.652
I right power 26.

15:35.095 --> 15:36.723
Hut!

15:40.895 --> 15:42.453
Hit somebody!

15:42.528 --> 15:43.953
What's going on
over there, Coach?

15:44.025 --> 15:46.851
I seen my granddaddy make
better blocks playing checkers.

15:46.928 --> 15:48.451
Yeah, if you could run
as fast as you talk,

15:48.525 --> 15:49.790
we'd probably score
every play.

15:49.855 --> 15:51.993
Look, you got some--you got
somethin' to say to me?

15:52.057 --> 15:53.223
You need to start gettin'
behind my blocks,

15:53.296 --> 15:54.491
right behind me.

15:54.557 --> 15:56.693
I can't keep doin' all this.
And you need to quit--

15:59.556 --> 16:00.822
Hey, what's wrong
with you guys?

16:05.597 --> 16:07.151
What the hell you doin'?

16:10.176 --> 16:10.600
Knock it off.

16:11.147 --> 16:12.273
Hey, get outta here!

16:12.347 --> 16:15.203
South side of Dillon,
baby, for real!

16:28.705 --> 16:30.843
Hey, Smash.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.802
Hey.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.172
Look.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.802
Your boyfriend's
a real piece of work.

16:38.637 --> 16:39.761
Well, at the moment,
I wouldn't really

16:39.778 --> 16:42.830
call him my boyfriend.

16:49.978 --> 16:51.102
Why are you
empty-handed, girl?

16:51.175 --> 16:52.402
G'on back there and get
some bags outta that car.

16:52.477 --> 16:54.202
You know I'm not supposed
to put stress on my back.

16:54.278 --> 16:55.672
Why me?

16:55.738 --> 16:56.972
So you're not around
to get the back of my hand

16:57.035 --> 16:58.003
is why.

16:58.075 --> 16:59.273
Brian never has
to do anything.

16:59.338 --> 17:00.232
Brian,
turn down that junk!

17:00.305 --> 17:01.473
That's not music.

17:01.537 --> 17:03.371
It's the devil's work,
is what it is.

17:07.405 --> 17:09.002
Have you lost your mind?

17:10.675 --> 17:12.403
You must be Mrs. Williams.

17:12.478 --> 17:13.733
Yes, I am.

17:13.808 --> 17:14.903
Messin' with white girls

17:14.974 --> 17:17.373
after gettin' in a fight
at practice.

17:18.656 --> 17:19.633
You're comin' with me.

17:21.724 --> 17:22.953
Move.

17:23.715 --> 17:24.941
This to get back
at Tim Riggins?

17:24.944 --> 17:25.691
What are you,
a shrink?

17:26.175 --> 17:27.372
Oh, I'd be nice.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.813
I work at Planned Parenthood.

17:28.878 --> 17:30.443
You probably haven't seen
the last of me.

17:30.518 --> 17:31.670
Hey, I know how
to use protection.

17:31.745 --> 17:32.970
I'm not some piece
of trash.

17:33.046 --> 17:34.873
Oh, no, you a class act
all the way.

17:34.948 --> 17:36.212
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

17:36.276 --> 17:38.871
It means you're safe
to walk from here.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.843
Come on.

17:53.078 --> 17:53.763
Come on.

18:03.508 --> 18:04.491
Hey.

18:05.078 --> 18:07.303
Hey, Coach.

18:10.077 --> 18:12.611
How you feelin'?

18:14.175 --> 18:17.112
Well, I'm, uh...

18:17.177 --> 18:19.072
not really feelin'
too much...

18:19.146 --> 18:20.211
right now.

18:24.547 --> 18:25.442
I, uh--

18:25.515 --> 18:27.542
The guys.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.632
All the guys signed it
up for ya.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.613
Oh, yeah.

18:34.688 --> 18:38.480
They all say hello.

18:38.558 --> 18:40.092
Did Riggins sign that?

18:40.096 --> 18:41.382
Riggins signed.
Everyone signed it.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.561
Huh.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.323
When'd you teach him how
to write his name?

18:47.358 --> 18:49.122
Well, he scrawled on there.
He didn't really--

18:50.787 --> 18:53.153
Well, that's really nice,
Coach.

18:53.228 --> 18:55.812
Here, I'm gonna just
set it down here.

18:55.888 --> 18:56.853
Thank you.

19:02.588 --> 19:03.880
Damn, son.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.082
Look, I don't think anyone
needs to tell you,

19:12.157 --> 19:15.521
but you know we're savin'
your spot over there.

19:17.728 --> 19:18.650
You know whatever
it takes,

19:18.655 --> 19:20.123
however long it takes--

19:20.126 --> 19:22.551
Yeah.

19:22.627 --> 19:24.082
We, uh--

19:24.156 --> 19:26.753
How's, uh--

19:26.826 --> 19:27.923
how's Saracen doin'?

19:30.886 --> 19:32.382
Saracen's doin' fine.

19:32.458 --> 19:36.050
He's throwin' like a girl,
but he's doin' fine.

19:36.127 --> 19:38.020
He's doin' fine.
It'll take some time.

19:39.455 --> 19:42.250
Well, uh--

19:44.628 --> 19:45.683
You know,
when I was--

19:45.757 --> 19:48.752
when I was kinda
like that kid?

19:48.828 --> 19:50.120
You know?

19:50.188 --> 19:51.652
I don't know.
He's a lot different.

19:54.387 --> 19:56.480
He doesn't need it real bad,
like I do, I think.

19:58.047 --> 19:59.003
He's kinda creative.

19:59.505 --> 20:00.771
You know?

20:01.205 --> 20:08.400
Listens to Bob Dylan
and draws pictures and...stuff.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.963
I don't know.
He's a--

20:11.037 --> 20:13.030
He's a good kid, I think.

20:13.105 --> 20:14.461
You free him up
a little bit

20:14.538 --> 20:16.233
out there on that field,
he'll, uh--

20:16.306 --> 20:20.401
he'll make some things
happen for you.

20:25.135 --> 20:28.060
You're a good man.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.762
You're a good man.

20:33.337 --> 20:35.560
You're what makes guys like me
wanna coach.

20:35.637 --> 20:39.431
You are a good man.

20:39.508 --> 20:42.001
Thank you.

20:42.067 --> 20:45.333
I'm sorry if I--

20:45.406 --> 20:48.800
sorry if I let you down.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.300
Let the team down.

20:53.366 --> 20:55.461
Damn, son.

20:55.536 --> 20:58.301
You didn't let me down.

20:58.365 --> 21:01.630
You did not let me down.

21:12.288 --> 21:13.482
You know, the problem is,

21:13.486 --> 21:15.883
is that they keep comparing you
to Jason Street.

21:15.947 --> 21:16.940
Know what I mean?
That's like--

21:17.015 --> 21:18.910
That's like comparin'
my music

21:19.635 --> 21:21.632
to the Red Hot Chili Peppers
or something.

21:21.636 --> 21:24.030
I mean, I'm not--I'm not
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.331
I mean--I mean,
I'm my own thing.

21:25.408 --> 21:26.461
I'm not any better
or any worse.

21:26.538 --> 21:27.630
It's just different.

21:27.705 --> 21:30.401
No, you're definitely
a whole lot worse.

21:30.465 --> 21:31.661
Okay, well,
that's not the point, all right?

21:31.737 --> 21:33.102
The point is,
you gotta learn

21:33.166 --> 21:34.531
how to work the media.

21:34.608 --> 21:37.102
You know, let them know
who Matt Saracen is.

21:37.168 --> 21:38.763
I mean, right now,
the bitches can't even get

21:38.835 --> 21:39.830
your name right.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.403
All right, well,
who is Matt Saracen?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.362
Who is Matt Saracen?

21:42.438 --> 21:44.102
Matt Saracen is QB1.

21:44.167 --> 21:46.963
And when the cameras
start rollin',

21:47.038 --> 21:50.431
just start spewin' stuff out.

21:50.506 --> 21:52.162
You know what I mean?
I mean...

21:52.235 --> 21:53.202
just be out there.

21:53.265 --> 21:56.360
The weirder you are,
the better, really.

21:56.438 --> 21:59.000
Not everyone's gonna be
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

21:59.006 --> 22:01.153
I mean...

22:02.405 --> 22:03.633
Jason Street
is a great guy.

22:04.356 --> 22:05.941
And everyone knows
what he's all about.

22:05.946 --> 22:09.110
So he's like--he's like
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

22:09.175 --> 22:11.573
Um, but--
and everyone likes that,

22:11.645 --> 22:14.411
and that's good,
but that's not me.

22:14.475 --> 22:16.671
Well, if Jason Street
is the Red Hot Chili Peppers,

22:16.748 --> 22:18.772
who are you?

22:18.848 --> 22:20.442
Uh--

22:20.517 --> 22:22.001
Exactly.

22:22.077 --> 22:23.671
I mean, who am I?

22:23.747 --> 22:25.642
Who--who am I?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.843
Big G, little O.

22:29.908 --> 22:30.941
Go, go!

22:30.948 --> 22:31.840
Sharp arms!

22:31.906 --> 22:35.692
Big G, little O.
Go, go!

22:35.695 --> 22:36.313
Last time.

22:36.318 --> 22:39.230
Big G, little O.
Go, go.

22:39.938 --> 22:40.241
Hey, Tim.

22:42.735 --> 22:43.800
Tim.

22:43.868 --> 22:45.532
Hey.
Hey.

22:45.605 --> 22:47.562
How you doin'
with all this?

22:47.636 --> 22:48.801
Well, you know.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.830
Yeah.

22:50.926 --> 22:52.482
Look, I know you're not
a chatterbox

22:52.487 --> 22:53.543
when it comes
to your feelings,

22:53.548 --> 22:56.740
but I'm here.

22:56.745 --> 22:59.301
Yeah, cool.

23:00.168 --> 23:01.813
You know, Jason's been asking
about you.

23:02.648 --> 23:03.460
Yeah.

23:04.138 --> 23:05.503
How, uh--
how is J.?

23:05.505 --> 23:06.403
He's good.
He's good?

23:06.478 --> 23:07.660
He's real good.

23:07.738 --> 23:08.662
He's still Jason.

23:10.798 --> 23:11.760
I know.

23:14.407 --> 23:16.163
I was gonna go over there
later, around 8:00.

23:17.805 --> 23:19.022
Visiting hours are over
at 6:00,

23:19.026 --> 23:20.821
but I kinda got
the place wired.

23:22.555 --> 23:23.620
You wanna come with?

23:27.226 --> 23:28.291
You know,
you wait too long,

23:28.367 --> 23:29.891
he might start takin' it
personal, Tim.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.993
The MRI shows damage
to the cord

23:36.998 --> 23:39.520
at the C7-T1 junction.

23:39.527 --> 23:41.122
It could be much worse.

23:41.127 --> 23:43.652
Jason, you're fortunate
that the fracture

23:43.666 --> 23:46.463
was low enough
that you'll still be able

23:46.467 --> 23:47.962
to use your arms and hands.

23:56.865 --> 23:58.560
It's okay.

23:58.636 --> 23:59.520
What about my legs, doc?

23:59.598 --> 24:01.580
Well, we'll just keep prayin'.

24:01.585 --> 24:02.990
And then once you start
physical therapy--

24:02.995 --> 24:03.851
Ma.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.341
Look, Dr. Kroll.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.841
I just wanna know
if I'm gonna be able

24:08.917 --> 24:09.841
to walk again.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.311
Please.

24:12.136 --> 24:13.111
Look, I can take it.

24:13.936 --> 24:17.073
All you gotta do
is tell me the truth.

24:19.408 --> 24:21.803
Tami, Tami.
Hi!

24:21.875 --> 24:22.931
Hey!
How are you?

24:23.006 --> 24:24.272
Good, how are you?
Good.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.331
Good to see you
the other night.
You, too.

24:26.406 --> 24:28.101
Y'all have a good dinner.
Okay, you, too.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.403
Hey.

24:29.475 --> 24:31.133
I'm so sorry.

24:31.205 --> 24:32.833
It's all right.

24:32.908 --> 24:33.930
It's all right.
I, uh--

24:34.007 --> 24:36.133
I made a couple of dates
for next week,

24:36.208 --> 24:38.001
one with a hog farmer
from Rio Tinto--

24:38.077 --> 24:39.473
Hog farmer
from Rio Tinto.
Mm-hmm.

24:39.536 --> 24:40.672
That's a new one.
Where's my daughter?

24:40.735 --> 24:41.872
I've always liked
hog farmers.

24:41.937 --> 24:42.930
Your daughter is
at dance rehearsal,

24:43.006 --> 24:44.930
which I've told you about
20 times.

24:45.006 --> 24:46.330
Oh.
How was your day?

24:46.407 --> 24:47.733
Um, my day--
my day--

24:47.808 --> 24:49.200
Sweetheart, would you take
your hat off

24:49.278 --> 24:51.171
at the table, please?

24:51.238 --> 24:52.200
You look so cute.

24:54.006 --> 24:56.030
You go first.

24:56.108 --> 24:57.630
Okay, you want the good news
or the bad news?

24:57.706 --> 24:59.100
No, good news.
Always the good news.

24:59.177 --> 25:00.200
All right, I'll give you
the bad news.

25:00.276 --> 25:02.002
AC? Done.

25:02.076 --> 25:04.171
Like I said,
we need a new unit.

25:04.235 --> 25:05.301
$3,000, minimum.

25:07.476 --> 25:08.371
What's the good news?

25:08.438 --> 25:09.430
There a cold front
movin' in?

25:09.435 --> 25:10.903
No, the good news
is that

25:10.976 --> 25:12.600
I think I might be able
to help you pay

25:12.608 --> 25:15.470
for the new unit 'cause I think
I got myself a job.

25:15.538 --> 25:17.441
Really?
Mm-hmm.

25:18.495 --> 25:20.043
That fast, you got a job?

25:20.045 --> 25:21.443
Yeah.
Where'd you get the job?

25:21.447 --> 25:23.912
I-I--at the school.

25:23.975 --> 25:25.512
What school?
At the high school.

25:25.576 --> 25:27.772
W--

25:27.848 --> 25:29.112
At my high school?

25:29.177 --> 25:30.841
I wasn't aware
that you had bought it,

25:30.918 --> 25:32.212
but yeah.

25:32.276 --> 25:34.641
I'm the new guidance counselor
at the high school

25:36.546 --> 25:38.242
You know that
guidance counselors

25:38.315 --> 25:40.241
can be a nuisance,
and that means--
Eric.

25:40.317 --> 25:41.870
We're gonna have
some interaction, and--

25:41.945 --> 25:43.642
Well, that's good.
Guidance counselors have
interaction.

25:43.715 --> 25:45.473
I think that's great that we're
gonna have some interaction.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.343
Well, I just think that we--
we should probably talk about--

25:47.418 --> 25:49.170
Well, I've taken
the job already.

25:52.747 --> 25:54.073
e, what happened
to the consultatn

25:54.147 --> 25:55.072
we were gonna have?

25:55.148 --> 25:56.070
Hello, Coach Taylor.

25:56.148 --> 25:57.340
Yeah.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.010
Thank you.

26:00.076 --> 26:02.072
It's the hospital calling
about Jason.

26:07.945 --> 26:09.373
Yeah.

26:09.445 --> 26:11.613
Hi.

26:11.678 --> 26:12.711
Yep.

26:38.558 --> 26:39.030
Uh--

26:44.257 --> 26:45.613
Jason's paralyzed.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.721
Uh...they say
with physical therapy,

26:49.787 --> 26:51.951
he'll regain use
of his arms, his hands,

26:52.016 --> 26:53.182
his upper body.

26:53.256 --> 26:54.512
But they don't think
he's gonna regain

26:54.586 --> 26:56.550
use of his legs.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.822
Now, listen up.

27:01.885 --> 27:03.881
Any of you need
to talk to me,

27:03.957 --> 27:08.723
you'll find me
in my office.

27:08.786 --> 27:10.481
Or you call me
any time.

27:10.555 --> 27:13.723
Do not hesitate.

27:19.685 --> 27:20.722
Now, that's all for today.

27:20.786 --> 27:22.650
We'll--

27:22.727 --> 27:23.780
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

27:31.398 --> 27:34.473
Forever means

27:35.365 --> 27:40.781
Until the day I leave

27:41.797 --> 27:46.581
Out of sight
means out of mind

27:47.596 --> 27:49.720
Okay, I right 44
lead bronco.

27:49.726 --> 27:50.853
Uh, open right,

27:50.927 --> 27:53.322
um--open right,

27:53.395 --> 27:55.151
draw to the tailback,

27:55.226 --> 27:56.491
off the right, uh, tackle.

27:56.556 --> 27:58.321
Okay, there you go.
You got one.

27:58.397 --> 28:00.391
Pro left, motion,
X-Y eagle.

28:00.455 --> 28:02.153
Uh, five-step drop,

28:02.226 --> 28:04.650
X-receiver runs
the five yard out, um--

28:04.726 --> 28:06.092
Uh--

28:06.157 --> 28:07.521
and the wide receiver
runs the button.

28:07.597 --> 28:08.890
Close.
The fullback releases.

28:08.956 --> 28:10.653
The fullback releases
under the outside linebackers.

28:10.727 --> 28:11.890
Damn it.

28:11.955 --> 28:13.593
Why are you yellin' at me?
I'm not.

28:13.655 --> 28:15.690
I mean, you only got,
like, 250 or so variations

28:15.758 --> 28:17.752
to go after this.

28:17.826 --> 28:20.290
You gonna give me my fries
anytime soon?

28:20.355 --> 28:22.393
Um, I'm sorry.

28:24.898 --> 28:27.321
Sorry. Here.
Here, you can have a free drink.

28:27.397 --> 28:29.792
Sorry about the wait.
I'm sorry.

28:41.767 --> 28:43.670
God.

28:46.038 --> 28:46.691
Lyla.

28:49.067 --> 28:50.851
I know, I should go.

28:50.867 --> 28:53.560
I'll be back at 6:00, okay?

28:53.628 --> 28:54.921
That's not what I'm sayin'.

28:54.996 --> 28:57.561
Uh--

28:57.626 --> 28:59.691
What?

28:59.766 --> 29:01.962
We have to talk about this.

29:02.027 --> 29:03.193
All right?
About me.

29:04.845 --> 29:06.912
I spoke to Dr. Kroll.
He didn't say it was impossible.

29:06.916 --> 29:07.843
Lyla.

29:07.916 --> 29:10.110
It would take a miracle

29:10.187 --> 29:11.442
for me to walk again.

29:11.515 --> 29:12.910
I mean, it's just not
gonna happen.

29:12.976 --> 29:15.180
You know what I think?

29:15.247 --> 29:18.240
I don't think Dr. Kroll
realizes who you are.

29:19.498 --> 29:20.460
We are gonna go out,

29:20.627 --> 29:22.611
and we are gonna find
the best doctors out there.

29:22.616 --> 29:23.090
That's what we're gonna do.

29:23.587 --> 29:24.580
Lyla, doctors don't--

29:24.655 --> 29:25.813
You are Jason Street.

29:25.888 --> 29:27.181
And I am Lyla Garrity.

29:27.256 --> 29:28.650
And everything is gonna
work out

29:28.716 --> 29:30.152
just the way
we planned it.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.050
Thank you, Lord,
for all that You have given

29:42.118 --> 29:44.313
to Jason and myself.

29:44.388 --> 29:46.410
We don't know yet
why You are putting us

29:46.485 --> 29:48.280
through this test,

29:48.355 --> 29:50.810
but I know that You'll find
a way to show us.

29:50.886 --> 29:53.551
And we will pull
through this test.

29:53.618 --> 29:56.983
Whatever it takes.

29:57.058 --> 29:58.582
Amen.

29:59.856 --> 30:00.812
Amen.

30:02.485 --> 30:03.452
Amen.

30:19.058 --> 30:19.990
I saw you pullin' up.

30:19.997 --> 30:22.422
Mm-hmm.
Thought you might.

30:22.425 --> 30:23.462
What are you doin'?

30:23.527 --> 30:25.691
Field's empty.
Let's go make out.

30:29.757 --> 30:30.993
How you doin'?

30:32.855 --> 30:34.822
Matt Saracen
isn't ready for this.

30:34.895 --> 30:36.991
Mm-hmm.

30:39.566 --> 30:40.520
This--

30:40.597 --> 30:42.852
this town.

30:45.398 --> 30:48.961
Oh, this town expects,
this town expects state.

30:49.835 --> 30:51.281
They expect
nothin' less, babe.

30:51.337 --> 30:52.303
I know.

30:52.378 --> 30:53.303
I tell you what.

30:53.375 --> 30:55.030
Right now, I have no idea
whether or not

30:55.105 --> 30:56.902
we can even win a game
and I'm serious

30:56.977 --> 30:59.502
when I say that.

30:59.577 --> 31:02.002
Yeah, well...

31:04.578 --> 31:06.901
I know what you're
gonna do.

31:06.978 --> 31:09.670
I know that you're
gonna mold that boy.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.201
You are gonna mold
Matt Saracen,

31:11.276 --> 31:13.732
same way you did
with Jason Street.

31:13.807 --> 31:15.670
You did it with Jeff Perell
back in Macedonia.

31:15.737 --> 31:18.031
You took that kid in.

31:18.106 --> 31:20.331
I mean, he didn't know
the difference

31:20.407 --> 31:23.123
between a skinny post
and an out-and-up.

31:23.135 --> 31:25.062
You made him
the best quarterback

31:25.066 --> 31:25.503
in the league.

31:26.068 --> 31:27.030
You did that.

31:27.097 --> 31:28.333
Yeah, well, I also had
close to a year

31:28.336 --> 31:28.920
to get him ready.

31:28.936 --> 31:30.462
This is a little bit different. I--
Well?

31:30.466 --> 31:32.190
I got no time here.
I got no time.

31:32.267 --> 31:33.763
I lose a game,
I'm on the road.

31:33.838 --> 31:35.890
I lose a couple more,
we're packin' our bags.

31:35.966 --> 31:36.963
And I tell you what.

31:37.026 --> 31:39.530
What they say, it's right.

31:39.597 --> 31:40.890
I mean, I--

31:40.967 --> 31:42.932
Jason Street,
he was my meal ticket.

31:42.995 --> 31:44.861
He's the only reason
I got this job,

31:44.937 --> 31:46.891
and God bless that boy.

31:46.967 --> 31:48.391
But I am screwed.

31:51.238 --> 31:52.662
You know what?

31:53.198 --> 31:54.530
I--

32:01.326 --> 32:03.493
There is not a person
in the world

32:03.556 --> 32:07.352
that could do this,
except for you.

32:10.097 --> 32:11.151
This is what you do.

32:11.225 --> 32:14.193
I've seen you do it
with my own eyes.

32:19.195 --> 32:20.550
I believe in you.

32:23.857 --> 32:25.120
I believe in you
with every cell

32:25.196 --> 32:26.523
in my being.

32:29.927 --> 32:32.322
Tame the wild beast.
I--I like that.

32:32.398 --> 32:33.852
Tame the wild beast.

32:33.926 --> 32:37.162
You know, I can't,
in good conscience,

32:37.175 --> 32:38.291
not go through any more...

32:49.538 --> 32:51.032
Uh, Grandma, you--

32:51.108 --> 32:52.872
you need to go into your room
for a minute, okay?

32:52.877 --> 32:54.603
Hmm? Who is it?
Grandma, please--

32:55.677 --> 32:56.601
Who is it, honey?

32:56.677 --> 32:58.773
Uh, who is it?

32:58.836 --> 32:59.803
Matt, it's Coach Taylor.
Who?

32:59.875 --> 33:00.871
It's Coach Taylor.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.071
Uh, hey, Coach.

33:02.137 --> 33:03.401
Coach Taylor's here?
Oh.

33:03.478 --> 33:05.101
How you doin'?

33:05.706 --> 33:06.133
How's it going?

33:06.738 --> 33:08.133
Good, good.

33:08.206 --> 33:09.102
Gonna open the door?

33:09.166 --> 33:11.102
Oh, yeah, how 'bout--

33:11.166 --> 33:12.630
How 'bout if we
just go outside?

33:12.706 --> 33:14.833
I think I'd like
to come inside.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.201
Okay.

33:19.007 --> 33:20.302
Um--

33:24.868 --> 33:27.630
So, uh, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.602
Uh, w-what's goin' on?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.630
Oh, not much.
I just thought I'd stop by.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.263
I wanted to have
a chat with you.

33:34.336 --> 33:35.401
Oh, it's, um--

33:35.465 --> 33:37.530
Okay, okay.

33:37.608 --> 33:39.932
Um, is everything
all right?

33:40.006 --> 33:41.533
I thought maybe we'd
go over--

33:41.606 --> 33:42.703
Hi, how are you, Coach?

33:42.777 --> 33:44.861
Hello, how are you?
Very nice to be here.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.303
Thank you.
Oh, nice to see you.

33:46.368 --> 33:47.403
Sit down.

33:47.468 --> 33:49.001
Honey, move those books.
Oh, sorry.

33:49.067 --> 33:51.101
And I brought you some cake.
I hope you'll enjoy it.

33:51.168 --> 33:52.332
Oh, no.
Sit down, have some.

33:52.407 --> 33:53.462
I appreciate that.
I--

33:53.538 --> 33:54.503
I tell you what.

33:54.565 --> 33:55.740
I, uh, I--

33:56.357 --> 33:58.960
Oh, wasn't he wonderful
Friday night?

33:59.688 --> 34:00.722
Ma'am, he was.

34:00.786 --> 34:01.980
Thanks, Grandma.

34:03.027 --> 34:04.431
I'm so proud of him.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.961
You should be proud
of him.

34:07.616 --> 34:09.183
Uh--
I'll tell you what.

34:09.185 --> 34:10.449
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to take Matt

34:10.514 --> 34:12.110
off your hands
for about an hour.

34:12.188 --> 34:13.411
There's something I'd like
to discuss with him

34:13.485 --> 34:15.702
as far as the
football game this week.

34:15.708 --> 34:15.781
Oh.

34:16.938 --> 34:18.763
Yes, you do have
a big game,

34:18.835 --> 34:20.062
and yes, you can take him.

34:20.137 --> 34:21.062
Thank you, ma'am.

34:21.138 --> 34:22.400
I'll have him back soon.

34:22.478 --> 34:23.371
But I want you
to come back.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.733
I will come back.

34:24.806 --> 34:25.929
I'll come back for some more cake.
All right. You'll better do that.

34:26.007 --> 34:27.032
Next time, I'm gonna have
the milk, too.

34:27.105 --> 34:28.530
I'll get you some milk.

34:28.607 --> 34:29.630
All right.

34:29.708 --> 34:30.630
And I've got
hot chocolate

34:30.706 --> 34:32.232
and everything
you could want.

34:32.308 --> 34:34.002
All right, you get some rest,
Grandma, okay?

34:34.068 --> 34:35.273
All right.
I'll wait for you.

34:35.337 --> 34:36.533
Okay.
Now, you listen.

34:36.606 --> 34:37.661
You listen to him.
I will.
I'll be home--

34:37.735 --> 34:39.132
Move your feet.
Move your feet more.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.203
Right.

34:40.275 --> 34:41.831
I love you, Grandma.

34:41.908 --> 34:43.003
Love you.

34:44.507 --> 34:45.471
Will do.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.762
Coach Taylor.

35:04.666 --> 35:07.302
I could never sleep
the night before a game.

35:07.377 --> 35:10.731
In my head,
I'd go over the plays

35:10.805 --> 35:11.763
over and over.

35:11.838 --> 35:14.300
It'd drive me crazy.
I'd read.

35:14.375 --> 35:16.333
Bought a book on meditation.
That didn't work.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.832
Your dad in Iraq,
that must be hard.

35:20.906 --> 35:23.230
It's not so bad, sir.

35:23.305 --> 35:24.861
I tell you what.

35:24.937 --> 35:26.270
My dad, he was anything
but in Iraq.

35:26.336 --> 35:28.003
My dad--

35:28.068 --> 35:29.900
my dad was on me
day in, day out.

35:29.908 --> 35:33.900
Still thinks I shoulda made
the NFL.

35:36.707 --> 35:39.631
But as much as I complain
about him,

35:39.706 --> 35:42.432
I don't know where I'd be
without him.

35:45.067 --> 35:47.400
You know, you--

35:47.478 --> 35:49.800
I don't know how
you do it.

35:51.227 --> 35:53.183
I mean, you got
your time commitments.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.923
You got your pressures.

35:55.127 --> 35:57.481
You got your studies.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.352
All that, and being the man
of the house, too.

36:02.688 --> 36:04.020
Yes, sir.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.212
I'll tell you somethin'.

36:11.285 --> 36:12.912
I know you didn't want me
to step foot

36:12.988 --> 36:14.583
in your house tonight.

36:14.657 --> 36:16.153
But I'll tell you
somethin' else,

36:16.216 --> 36:18.312
and don't you ever
forget this:

36:19.596 --> 36:21.280
You should feel proud.

36:22.557 --> 36:23.851
You should feel real proud.

36:23.925 --> 36:25.723
Yes, sir.

36:30.845 --> 36:32.483
This is all yours
for the takin'.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.541
Depends on how much
you want it.

36:37.616 --> 36:39.340
It's yours
for the takin'.

36:41.847 --> 36:43.480
You know,
the other night,

36:43.545 --> 36:44.681
you played
for a few minutes.

36:44.747 --> 36:46.311
Tomorrow, four quarters.

36:46.387 --> 36:50.843
You can't be distracted
by anything.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.240
You're gonna have a lot
of distractions.

36:52.316 --> 36:53.842
You're gonna have our fans,
their fans.

36:53.915 --> 36:55.081
You got the band.

36:55.145 --> 36:57.111
You got the cheerleaders,
with their pretty,

36:57.185 --> 37:00.010
young-shaped legs
bouncin' up and down.

37:01.986 --> 37:03.940
You got a job to do.

37:04.015 --> 37:05.780
Nothing else.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.442
Your teammates
gonna need to hear you!

37:20.518 --> 37:22.482
You call the plays!

37:22.546 --> 37:24.883
You gonna be able
to call the plays?

37:24.947 --> 37:26.741
Yes, sir.

37:26.815 --> 37:29.381
22 rocket on hit.

37:32.115 --> 37:33.483
22.

37:33.546 --> 37:34.742
20--
22 rock--

37:34.815 --> 37:36.213
I can't hear you.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.542
22.

37:38.617 --> 37:41.443
I can't hear you.

37:41.515 --> 37:42.842
22!

37:44.055 --> 37:45.252
22 rocket--
This should be--

37:45.255 --> 37:47.821
You're QB1
of the Dillon Panthers.

37:47.827 --> 37:49.220
Your teammates,
if they can hear you,

37:49.298 --> 37:50.950
they will believe in you.

37:51.027 --> 37:52.753
Now, you let it out
until it hurts!

37:52.828 --> 37:53.820
You understand me?

37:53.898 --> 37:55.290
22!

37:55.356 --> 37:57.492
22 rocket!

37:57.558 --> 37:59.020
Hit, hit, hit!

38:01.155 --> 38:03.323
44 crossfire
on red.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.522
44!

38:06.595 --> 38:08.793
44 crossfire!

38:08.855 --> 38:10.451
Red, red, red!

38:10.525 --> 38:11.590
What's your name?

38:11.657 --> 38:13.953
Matt Saracen!

38:14.025 --> 38:15.353
What you play?

38:15.425 --> 38:16.552
QB1!

38:16.626 --> 38:18.090
And how do you play it?

38:18.157 --> 38:19.093
Perfectly!

38:19.155 --> 38:20.591
We'll see about that.

38:20.657 --> 38:22.050
Who do you play for,
Saracen?

38:22.125 --> 38:23.292
Dillon Panthers!

38:23.357 --> 38:25.852
How much do you
want this?

38:25.925 --> 38:27.893
I want it, Coach.
How much
do you want this?

38:27.957 --> 38:29.350
I want it!

38:29.428 --> 38:30.552
Then take it!

38:30.627 --> 38:32.121
Do it again!

38:32.196 --> 38:34.093
44 crossfire!

38:34.158 --> 38:35.123
Hit, hit, hit, hit!

38:38.218 --> 38:38.923
Well, Eric, you know,

38:39.447 --> 38:40.740
you and I've known each other
a long time.

38:40.758 --> 38:42.481
I've known you since,
well,

38:42.546 --> 38:44.532
I was just a salesman here,

38:44.535 --> 38:45.713
and you were the junior high
coach over there.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.830
And, uh, well,

38:48.907 --> 38:51.702
you probably liked me
a lot more then, didn't you?

38:51.768 --> 38:53.402
I wouldn't say that.
I don't know.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.601
Well, I like you, Eric.

38:55.435 --> 38:56.893
I just want you
to always know that.

38:56.896 --> 38:58.100
I like you,
and I believe in you,

38:58.128 --> 38:59.750
and I'm glad
you're back here with us.

39:00.057 --> 39:00.493
Good.
I appreciate that.

39:01.425 --> 39:03.953
So.
It's Friday night.

39:04.026 --> 39:05.520
You feel it?
You ready for it?

39:05.597 --> 39:06.493
Game night?
Yep, mm-hmm.

39:06.555 --> 39:07.621
Right?
You ready to go?

39:07.695 --> 39:08.890
We're gonna give 'em our best,
you bet.

39:08.957 --> 39:11.350
Well, I don't want
to hear that.

39:11.427 --> 39:12.453
Now, this is not
just some game.

39:12.528 --> 39:13.181
You realize that.

39:13.188 --> 39:14.958
After what's happened
with Jason.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.212
I mean, this is
about tradition.

39:16.286 --> 39:17.681
It's about this town.

39:17.755 --> 39:20.080
It's about the spirit
and keepin' this town alive.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.801
That's football.
That's all we got.

39:21.885 --> 39:23.151
Now, if we lose
this game,

39:23.215 --> 39:26.613
this town's just gonna be
in a turmoil.

39:26.685 --> 39:27.953
And I don't need that.

39:28.018 --> 39:29.712
Nah, we don't--
we don't need that.
No.

39:29.788 --> 39:32.453
This team needs a W.

39:35.016 --> 39:36.010
This town needs a W.

39:39.128 --> 39:39.763
Hey.

39:41.258 --> 39:42.092
Always friends.

39:42.285 --> 39:43.812
All right.
Good.

39:43.886 --> 39:45.612
Go get 'em tonight,
Coach.

39:46.758 --> 39:47.752
Always friends.

39:48.897 --> 39:49.953
Always and ever.

39:50.028 --> 39:50.990
Always.

39:52.526 --> 39:57.690
Oh, Lord,
it really brings me down

39:57.758 --> 40:00.690
About the devil town

40:02.928 --> 40:07.092
All my friends
were vampires

40:07.155 --> 40:12.451
Didn't know
they were vampires

40:12.525 --> 40:16.252
Turns out
I was a vampire myself

40:16.326 --> 40:19.391
In the devil town

40:39.626 --> 40:45.120
I was livin'
in the devil town

40:45.198 --> 40:49.491
Didn't know
it was a devil town

40:49.556 --> 40:53.492
Oh, Lord,
and it brings me down

40:53.555 --> 40:56.393
About the devil town

41:16.995 --> 41:22.791
And all my friends
were vampires

41:22.858 --> 41:26.793
Didn't know
they were vampires

41:26.856 --> 41:32.352
Turns out
I was a vampire myself

41:32.358 --> 41:34.493
All right, listen up.

41:34.505 --> 41:35.683
We've suffered a big loss.

41:36.647 --> 41:37.747
A big loss.

41:37.747 --> 41:39.911
Some of you may be scared.

41:39.986 --> 41:41.413
And that's natural.

41:41.487 --> 41:44.583
Now, some of you
may be really pissed off.

41:44.647 --> 41:45.681
One good thing
about football is

41:45.745 --> 41:47.942
we get to channel
that energy.

41:48.018 --> 41:50.540
This team has never been
about one player.

41:50.617 --> 41:53.081
It's about all of us.
Every single one of us.

41:53.145 --> 41:55.580
And if we're gonna come back
from this loss,

41:55.646 --> 41:58.282
we're gonna need
every one of us.

41:58.347 --> 42:00.581
Not one man.
Every single one of us.

42:00.648 --> 42:01.583
Together.

42:01.646 --> 42:03.582
All right, let's pray.

42:03.648 --> 42:05.242
Dear Lord,
please let us have

42:05.315 --> 42:06.511
a successful night tonight.

42:08.028 --> 42:09.012
A safe game.

42:09.585 --> 42:11.282
Please let us all play
to our fullest potential.

42:11.345 --> 42:14.541
Please look over
Jason Street.

42:14.618 --> 42:16.246
Let him know that he's
in all of our hearts.

42:16.246 --> 42:17.287
We love him.

42:17.287 --> 42:19.118
And we miss him.

42:19.118 --> 42:21.962
Thine is the kingdom,
the power, the glory,

42:21.968 --> 42:22.880
forever and ever.

42:23.316 --> 42:23.820
Amen.

42:23.820 --> 42:24.751
Amen!

42:24.757 --> 42:25.991
Clear eyes, full hearts...

42:25.995 --> 42:27.113
...can't lose!

42:27.117 --> 42:28.203
Let's get 'em!

42:32.388 --> 42:33.112
Let's get 'em
out there, now!

42:35.818 --> 42:36.490
Y'all take care.

42:37.738 --> 42:39.410
Coach, good luck.

42:45.455 --> 42:50.241
I was living
in a devil town

42:50.245 --> 42:51.481
Didn't know it was...

42:52.847 --> 42:53.843
You up for this?

42:55.447 --> 42:56.373
Yes, sir.

42:56.445 --> 43:00.000
Let me ask you
one question.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.673
Last Friday night,
when you threw that pass,

43:01.748 --> 43:05.271
that--that winning pass...

43:05.347 --> 43:06.643
did you close your eyes?

43:06.707 --> 43:09.571
No, sir.

43:09.647 --> 43:10.802
My eyes were open, sir.

43:12.945 --> 43:13.940
My eyes were wide open.

43:14.008 --> 43:14.903
That's what I thought.

43:14.977 --> 43:16.501
Let's go play football.
Come on.
