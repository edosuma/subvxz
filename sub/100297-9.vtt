WEBVTT

00:04.419 --> 00:05.617
- Mr. Baxter.
- Uh-huh.

00:05.619 --> 00:06.652
I need your help.

00:06.654 --> 00:08.151
Listen, we've already
talked about this, okay?

00:08.154 --> 00:11.182
There are no psychotic clowns
living in the sewers, okay?

00:13.444 --> 00:16.552
No. I need you to
protect me from Vanessa.

00:16.554 --> 00:19.388
Protect you from Vanessa? She loves you.

00:19.390 --> 00:22.058
You must have really screwed up.

00:22.060 --> 00:25.653
She loves me too much.
You know how I applied

00:25.655 --> 00:27.655
to the Rocky Mountain
Geologic Institute?

00:27.657 --> 00:29.313
RMGI, yeah.

00:29.315 --> 00:32.817
Your mascot is the Earth's crust.

00:33.313 --> 00:34.502
Go, Crusties.

00:34.504 --> 00:35.647
Now get out there and play,

00:35.649 --> 00:38.666
and make sure everybody
walks all over you, everybody.

00:38.668 --> 00:41.577
Vanessa heard they're sending
out acceptance letters.

00:41.579 --> 00:43.838
She keeps asking me whether
I've heard from them.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.174
(STAMMERS) I'm-I'm-I'm
gonna get some coffee.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.009
Come into the kitchen.
Hold on a second. Come on.

00:48.011 --> 00:50.753
I wrote a vlog about
this about a year ago.

00:50.755 --> 00:52.180
It's how sometimes

00:52.182 --> 00:54.941
when the people we love
just want the best for us...

00:54.943 --> 00:57.760
Yeah, yeah, cool story.

00:57.762 --> 01:00.521
How do I get Vanessa to back off?

01:00.523 --> 01:02.115
Just be patient.

01:02.117 --> 01:03.474
She's probably just nervous

01:03.703 --> 01:05.141
about you getting in that school.

01:05.144 --> 01:06.786
I'm nervous enough about it already.

01:06.788 --> 01:08.529
Every time Vanessa asks me,

01:08.531 --> 01:10.981
I can feel my hypothalamus
telling my adrenal glands

01:10.983 --> 01:12.459
to flood my veins with epinephrine.

01:13.904 --> 01:17.003
Oh, Jen, hey, uh, have-have
you heard from the school yet?

01:17.005 --> 01:19.940
Honey, honey, can't-can't
you smell that? Epinephrine?

01:22.471 --> 01:23.970
No, I haven't heard anything.

01:23.972 --> 01:25.546
All right, well, fingers crossed.

01:25.548 --> 01:27.623
You know, it's the best
geology school in the state,

01:27.625 --> 01:29.309
and if those "pebble" know anything,

01:29.311 --> 01:32.795
of "quartz" they'll let you in. (LAUGHS)

01:32.797 --> 01:35.464
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:35.466 --> 01:36.816
Help me.

01:36.818 --> 01:40.010
Have a good day, Jen. (STAMMERS)

01:40.012 --> 01:42.230
Honey...

01:42.232 --> 01:43.655
do you think we should be pushing Jen

01:43.657 --> 01:45.474
to put all her eggs in one basket?

01:45.476 --> 01:47.685
Remember we did this
with Eve and West Point?

01:47.687 --> 01:49.662
When they said no, she was devastated.

01:49.664 --> 01:52.240
No, no. Jen has applied to
a bunch of other schools,

01:52.242 --> 01:54.501
and, look, RMGI is-is legendary.

01:54.503 --> 01:56.485
It would mean the world if I got in.

01:56.487 --> 01:58.213
If <i> you</i> got in?

01:59.991 --> 02:01.991
No, look, do not put words in my mouth.

02:01.993 --> 02:03.551
I said "if <i> I</i> got in".

02:06.497 --> 02:08.431
Okay, I heard it that time.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.498

02:17.216 --> 02:19.550
It's so cool that Jen
wants to have lunch with us.

02:19.552 --> 02:22.028
Oh, no, no, she-she doesn't.
She just wants to avoid Mom,

02:22.030 --> 02:25.106
and I offered to help her
because I'm great at it.

02:25.108 --> 02:26.533
In eighth grade,

02:26.535 --> 02:29.994
I saw Mom exactly twice.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.230
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

02:33.232 --> 02:34.707
So, where are we going?

02:34.709 --> 02:37.618
Well, Mandy wants
pizza and I want tacos,

02:37.620 --> 02:39.546
so we're gonna let you pick.

02:39.548 --> 02:43.049
Pizza with gooey cheese and tomatoes?

02:43.051 --> 02:45.293
Or, even better,

02:45.295 --> 02:48.012
tacos with gooey cheese and tomatoes?

02:49.976 --> 02:51.207
Speaking of choices,

02:51.209 --> 02:53.042
I have something I
want you to think about.

02:53.044 --> 02:56.271
I have a lot to think about
already. Thanks, though.

02:57.754 --> 02:59.494
No, you can't get out of this, Jen.

02:59.496 --> 03:01.016
He's gonna force some wisdom on you.

03:01.018 --> 03:02.810
He's done it to me my whole life.

03:02.812 --> 03:05.980
Me, too, and I love it.

03:05.982 --> 03:09.558
Okay, you think you just have
one choices of restaurant.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.743
That may not be the case.

03:10.745 --> 03:12.078
You might get there and it's closed,

03:12.080 --> 03:13.458
or there's too many people in it,

03:13.460 --> 03:14.730
or you don't want to be there,

03:14.732 --> 03:17.157
but you know there's always
other restaurants to go to.

03:17.159 --> 03:18.826
- Do you follow me?
- Yes.

03:18.828 --> 03:20.903
No, but I feel this
is for Jen's benefit,

03:20.905 --> 03:22.780
so I'll save my questions.

03:22.782 --> 03:25.333
He's talking about my
college applications.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.619
Oh. This may take a while. We
will wait for you in the car.

03:28.621 --> 03:30.575
- Come on, babe.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, but I'm going back to school.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.268
I want to hear what makes
college a restaurant.

03:34.754 --> 03:35.754
Okay.

03:37.791 --> 03:40.297
I appreciate your advice, Mr. Baxter,

03:40.299 --> 03:42.591
but I really don't want to
think about colleges right now.

03:42.593 --> 03:45.778
Okay, well, then don't check
your e-mail every five minutes.

03:45.780 --> 03:48.490
Actually, I was watching
one of your vlogs.

03:51.769 --> 03:55.312
Well, you certainly don't
want to binge on those.

03:55.314 --> 03:57.731
You'll lose a whole
weekend on that stuff.

03:58.258 --> 03:59.697
Did you, did you like one of them?

03:59.699 --> 04:00.965
What'd you, what'd you see you liked?

04:00.967 --> 04:03.948
It's that one where you relate
your love of deep-sea fishing

04:03.950 --> 04:05.965
to the economic policies
of Ronald Reagan.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.800
Oh, yikes.

04:07.802 --> 04:11.161
The Gipper and Flipper.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.805
It's a classic, it's a classic.

04:12.807 --> 04:14.456
That's a great one, good one.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.500
I'm impressed how you can
combine humor with insight,

04:17.503 --> 04:18.978
all while creatively highlighting

04:18.980 --> 04:20.221
the Outdoor Man brand.

04:20.223 --> 04:24.322
Wow. Look at you.

04:24.324 --> 04:26.681
Getting to understand
marketing strategy, are you?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.113
You know what?

04:28.115 --> 04:30.207
I'm about ready to shoot
a vlog in 20 minutes.

04:30.209 --> 04:31.616
You want to watch how we do it?

04:31.618 --> 04:34.995
Uh, did the Gipper love jelly beans?

04:34.997 --> 04:37.381
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

04:37.383 --> 04:39.717
Great, I just have to
tell Kyle and Mandy, okay?

04:39.719 --> 04:40.816
Oh, you don't have to tell Kyle.

04:40.818 --> 04:42.779
He's probably listening
right out there. Kyle!

04:42.781 --> 04:44.136
She's not having lunch with you.

04:44.138 --> 04:46.448
Okay, thanks.

04:49.395 --> 04:51.636
Okay.

04:51.638 --> 04:53.805
We have the brisket plate

04:53.807 --> 04:56.900
and the brick chicken. (CHUCKLES)

04:56.902 --> 04:59.184
Sorry for the wait, guys,
I just, you know, well...

04:59.186 --> 05:01.501
(CHUCKLES) I'm carrying
my own load of bricks.

05:01.503 --> 05:04.834
Should Kristin be waiting tables?

05:04.836 --> 05:07.319
Huh. No, probably not,

05:07.321 --> 05:09.529
but you know the Baxters, they're tough.

05:09.531 --> 05:11.198
- Mm.
- Yeah.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.700
You know, Mike once sewed
one of his fingers back on.

05:13.702 --> 05:15.753
What?

05:15.755 --> 05:19.181
Just-just take a look next time.
The knuckle's on the wrong side.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.876
- (LAUGHS)
- Okay, fellas, here's your check.

05:22.878 --> 05:25.003
- Hey.
- Whew. I need a breather.

05:25.005 --> 05:27.615
(SIGHS)

05:27.617 --> 05:29.216
What are you doing waiting on tables?

05:29.218 --> 05:31.435
Are you short-staffed
or something, what?

05:31.437 --> 05:34.012
Ah, probably. I need to
set up some interviews,

05:34.014 --> 05:36.273
but, uh, oh, I'm just so busy.

05:36.275 --> 05:38.350
Kristin, you shouldn't
be working a lunch shift.

05:38.352 --> 05:40.393
You should put your feet up.

05:40.395 --> 05:42.854
That's how I got into this mess.

05:42.856 --> 05:44.731
- (ED MUTTERING)
- (CHUCK LAUGHING)

05:44.733 --> 05:47.025
No, no, no, no. I'm okay.

05:47.027 --> 05:49.712
You know, I-I take a break
here and there. (CHUCKLES)

05:49.714 --> 05:51.455
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:51.457 --> 05:53.198
Wow.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.242
- I know what I'm gonna do.
- Hmm?

05:55.244 --> 05:57.869
I'm gonna give that brave little lady

05:57.871 --> 06:00.247
a big fat tip.

06:00.249 --> 06:02.014
You're a good man, Ed.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.224
Yup.

06:05.137 --> 06:06.854
You could be a good man, too, Chuck.

06:08.974 --> 06:12.109
I don't see why one of
us just can't be good.

06:16.574 --> 06:18.649
- Hey, hon.
- Hey, Vanessa.

06:18.651 --> 06:20.409
Good, good, good, you're finally home.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.227
Jen wanted to see how
the vlogs were made,

06:22.229 --> 06:23.895
and then we stuck around a little while,

06:23.897 --> 06:26.006
I showed her how I put
the graphics in and edit.

06:26.008 --> 06:29.248
- It was great.
- It was amazing.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.921
I never knew marketing
was so fascinating.

06:31.923 --> 06:34.139
To see Mr. Baxter craft his vlog

06:34.141 --> 06:37.757
is to watch Van Gogh paint.

06:37.759 --> 06:39.452
- Okay, whatever.
- MIKE: We're not done yet.

06:39.454 --> 06:41.505
You see, now let her
finish, let her finish.

06:41.507 --> 06:43.158
It was so much fun, Vanessa.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.424
I even pitched him a
line and he used it.

06:45.426 --> 06:47.436
Tell her the line, tell her. Go
ahead, tell her, tell her, tell her.

06:47.438 --> 06:49.012
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

06:49.014 --> 06:51.331
"You don't have to be a vegetarian

06:51.333 --> 06:53.934
to want to save a buck".

06:55.596 --> 06:58.471
You get it? It's a, it's a pun.

06:58.473 --> 06:59.857
It's a pun, but it's entertaining

06:59.859 --> 07:00.979
'cause it's not about rocks.

07:02.477 --> 07:05.028
That's, uh-uh, very, very
clever, Jen, that's...

07:05.030 --> 07:07.439
It was just one line.

07:07.441 --> 07:08.866
The rest of the genius was provided,

07:08.868 --> 07:12.319
of course, by Mr. Baxter.

07:12.321 --> 07:14.538
Okay, well-well, speaking of genius,

07:14.540 --> 07:16.948
uh, guess what came in the mail today.

07:16.950 --> 07:19.134
- Picture of me?
- No!

07:19.136 --> 07:21.637
A big, fat envelope

07:21.639 --> 07:23.997
from the Rocky Mountain
Geologic Institute.

07:23.999 --> 07:26.458
- Oh, wow.
- You got in.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.853
(CHUCKLES) Oh, congratulations, Jen.

07:30.982 --> 07:33.673
Well, look at that, I did get in.

07:33.675 --> 07:36.652
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

07:39.097 --> 07:42.349
Jen, why-why aren't you
excited? I... You're in shock.

07:42.351 --> 07:45.852
No. I just don't know if
I want to go there anymore.

07:45.854 --> 07:48.914
I think I'd rather go somewhere
with a marketing department.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:59.677 --> 08:02.761
What did you do?

08:08.658 --> 08:09.822
<i>VANESSA: Don't you dare</i>

08:09.824 --> 08:11.378
play innocent with me.

08:11.380 --> 08:14.598
You lured that child
with your slick vlogs

08:14.600 --> 08:16.216
and your clever slogans.

08:16.218 --> 08:19.719
Ooh, "Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man".

08:20.453 --> 08:22.118
- Lured?
- Lured, yes.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.556
You make it sound like
I was waiting out front

08:23.558 --> 08:25.234
in a van full of candy and crack.

08:27.562 --> 08:29.354
Marketing is a great profession.

08:29.356 --> 08:31.040
I studied it at University of Michigan.

08:31.042 --> 08:34.424
Yeah, well, they teach it at
the Ohio State University, too.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.663
Yeah, but at Michigan
they teach it properly.

08:39.116 --> 08:42.452
You know, Jen's father sent
her here to become a scientist,

08:42.720 --> 08:45.370
and geology needs smart, passionate,

08:45.372 --> 08:46.463
talented young women.

08:46.465 --> 08:48.373
- Every field needs those.
- (SIGHS)

08:48.375 --> 08:51.710
You know, do you remember
my mentor Professor Quinn?

08:51.712 --> 08:54.396
Yeah? He encouraged me

08:54.398 --> 08:55.880
when geology was almost

08:55.882 --> 08:59.259
entirely male and not
particularly friendly to women.

08:59.261 --> 09:01.904
Because none of those
men had ever met a female.

09:05.225 --> 09:08.101
You know, Professor Q
told me to never give up.

09:08.103 --> 09:10.654
He always had my back,

09:10.656 --> 09:14.607
and Jen, Jen is my chance
to pay that forward.

09:14.609 --> 09:16.943
Right, so this has nothing to do with

09:16.945 --> 09:19.904
turning Jen into a carbon copy of you.

09:19.906 --> 09:21.674
Of course it is.

09:23.452 --> 09:25.452
And all that other high-minded,

09:25.454 --> 09:28.455
"good for society" crap. I...

09:28.457 --> 09:31.190
You can't strong-arm a kid into doing

09:31.192 --> 09:32.826
what you want them to do.

09:32.828 --> 09:35.437
Oh, yeah, you're right. No,
you're right, you're right.

09:35.439 --> 09:37.797
That is what marketing is for.

09:37.799 --> 09:41.110
Well, you know what, Mike?
I can get through to Jen,

09:41.112 --> 09:43.303
and you are not the only one

09:43.305 --> 09:45.781
with a van full of crack.

09:48.285 --> 09:50.310
Do you know that literally
every device in this house

09:50.312 --> 09:52.604
listens to us now?

09:52.606 --> 09:54.147
If the government is listening,

09:54.149 --> 09:57.602
we do not have a van full of crack!

10:02.541 --> 10:05.950
Chuck, could you call my phone, please?

10:05.952 --> 10:07.636
Yeah, sure. Did you lose it again?

10:07.638 --> 10:10.305
No, no, no, see, I've-I've
got a cramp in my quad

10:10.307 --> 10:12.165
and I-I need a-a massage...

10:12.167 --> 10:13.308
(PHONE BUZZING)

10:13.310 --> 10:15.168
Ah, there we go.

10:15.170 --> 10:17.003
(LAUGHS)

10:17.005 --> 10:18.620
Just call me back in 20 minutes.

10:18.622 --> 10:20.432
That feels good.

10:20.434 --> 10:23.343
Hey. Hey, Ed, take a look at this.

10:23.345 --> 10:24.961
You got a shoplifter?

10:24.963 --> 10:27.689
No, no, no, no. This is from
the camera on the loading dock.

10:29.234 --> 10:30.850
ED: Good Lord.

10:30.852 --> 10:32.536
She's playing Hacky Sack.

10:34.740 --> 10:37.833
I'm zero months' pregnant
and I can't play Hacky Sack.

10:38.911 --> 10:40.527
- Ed.
- What?

10:40.529 --> 10:42.245
Do you think... ?

10:42.247 --> 10:44.697
She's playing us? Oh, yes.

10:44.699 --> 10:47.158
Yes, that's another
thing about the Baxters...

10:47.160 --> 10:49.720
they know how to work the con.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.541
- Hi, Vanessa.
- Hey.

10:54.543 --> 10:57.043
- What are you doing?
- I am planning a lesson

10:57.045 --> 10:59.838
on density, and I am
arranging all of these in order

10:59.840 --> 11:01.765
from lowest to highest.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.859
What's wrong?

11:03.861 --> 11:07.771
You've got your limestone where
your amphibolite should be.

11:07.773 --> 11:09.722
Have you lost your marble?

11:09.724 --> 11:11.775
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:11.777 --> 11:13.535
All right, first of all, I love you.

11:13.537 --> 11:15.520
- I...
- (CHUCKLES)

11:15.522 --> 11:17.856
And second, how can you throw away

11:17.858 --> 11:19.732
all this amazing knowledge?

11:19.734 --> 11:21.901
Oh, I'm starving. What do
we got? Oh, rocks again?

11:21.903 --> 11:24.046
Can't we have pea gravel just once?

11:24.048 --> 11:28.023
No, I... listen, I-I'm
trying to prove to Jen

11:28.025 --> 11:30.702
that she still has a
passion for geology.

11:30.704 --> 11:33.378
- Of course I do.
- Yeah... Well, great. Fantastic.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.965
RMGI, here we come.

11:34.967 --> 11:37.726
Vanessa, I'm still not sure about RMGI.

11:37.728 --> 11:39.636
It's nothing but geology, and...

11:39.638 --> 11:42.755
what if I want to do
something else with my life?

11:42.757 --> 11:45.216
- It would be perfectly all right.
- Mike...

11:45.218 --> 11:46.977
Think about it. Don't we know somebody

11:46.979 --> 11:49.071
who had a very fixed idea
of what to do with their life

11:49.073 --> 11:51.466
- and then they completely changed direction?
- No, no.

11:51.468 --> 11:53.600
You cannot compare Jen to Kristin.

11:53.602 --> 11:57.437
Jen did not get pregnant
in high school. Right?

11:57.439 --> 11:59.748
I meant you. Geologist-turned-teacher

11:59.750 --> 12:01.491
- who may run for office?
- Oh, no.

12:01.493 --> 12:04.054
Don't you dare use me against me.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.321
Listen, kids like Jen
became exchange students

12:06.323 --> 12:07.614
so they could learn and grow,

12:07.616 --> 12:08.907
and I think we've done a good job here.

12:08.909 --> 12:10.667
Yes. Yes, you have.

12:10.669 --> 12:12.963
Living in America has
really opened my mind

12:12.965 --> 12:15.097
and made me realize I
could become something

12:15.407 --> 12:16.840
I never even dreamed of.

12:16.842 --> 12:18.917
Right. Well, America helped,
but it's mostly living here.

12:18.919 --> 12:20.185
With me.

12:21.922 --> 12:25.607
Vanessa, Mr. Baxter,

12:25.609 --> 12:29.403
I'm gonna be a social media influencer.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.033
Thank you both.

12:38.789 --> 12:40.789
What did you do?

12:47.113 --> 12:48.797
Hey, Mike Baxter for Outdoor Man.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.041
This is a sonar fish finder.

12:51.043 --> 12:53.952
You know, if Nemo's dad
had bought one of these,

12:53.954 --> 12:56.263
that movie would have
been four minutes long.

12:58.309 --> 13:00.642
You see, most fish
don't want to be found.

13:00.644 --> 13:02.335
So we invented this baby.

13:02.337 --> 13:05.981
You can swim, but you can't hide.

13:05.983 --> 13:08.675
Yeah, fish need depth to survive,

13:08.677 --> 13:11.010
so fishermen explore the depths to eat.

13:11.012 --> 13:14.472
Rest of society? Not
too interested in depth.

13:14.474 --> 13:16.349
In fact, if you go online,

13:16.351 --> 13:19.453
you'll realize the more
shallow the better, right?

13:21.022 --> 13:23.498
And you sell some "new" makeup,

13:23.500 --> 13:26.150
boom... you're a billionaire.

13:26.152 --> 13:27.986
A kid unboxing a toy...

13:27.988 --> 13:31.081
a hundred million views?

13:31.083 --> 13:33.013
Oh, and a cat chasing a dog?

13:33.015 --> 13:36.011
Humanity grinds to a halt.

13:36.013 --> 13:39.993
Hell, it's gotten so bad, if
you just call a song "Shallow",

13:39.995 --> 13:43.209
we'll give you an Academy Award.

13:43.211 --> 13:47.355
But a TED Talk, a TED Talk
about the complex decision-making

13:47.357 --> 13:50.675
of a bacteria, the oldest
living organism on Earth:

13:50.677 --> 13:51.968
boring.

13:51.970 --> 13:53.845
No one's forwarding that video.

13:53.847 --> 13:57.724
Which is why bacteria will
be here long after we're gone.

13:57.726 --> 14:01.611
It probably explains the
fever I have right now.

14:01.613 --> 14:05.864
You see, when you're completely
unserious as a species,

14:05.866 --> 14:08.359
who knows what depths we'll sink to?

14:08.361 --> 14:10.879
Man, oh, man. But it
doesn't have to be that way.

14:10.881 --> 14:13.623
We can get as serious
about fishing for meaning

14:13.625 --> 14:15.625
as anglers are fishing for dinner.

14:15.627 --> 14:17.577
And if you buy one of these,

14:17.579 --> 14:19.462
I'll throw in a piece of equipment

14:19.464 --> 14:22.799
that makes fishing with your
buddies even more meaningful.

14:22.801 --> 14:26.019
The Sportsman Gasmaster 6000.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.398
It's a motion detector...
it looks like a camera,

14:29.400 --> 14:32.359
- but they walk by it and...
- (FART SOUND)

14:39.243 --> 14:40.933
Wow. That...

14:40.935 --> 14:42.995
It works somehow without batteries.

14:46.566 --> 14:49.543
And that's a Baxter out.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.280
- She's on her way up.
- Okay, good, good, okay.

14:54.282 --> 14:56.452
- Now, remember, right, she comes in.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:56.454 --> 14:58.001
We tell her the cat's out of the bag.

14:58.003 --> 14:59.594
- Right.
- Right? She apologizes,

14:59.596 --> 15:01.471
- and that's it. We move on.
- Well, yeah...

15:02.433 --> 15:04.007
Hey, guys. What's up?

15:04.009 --> 15:06.793
Thanks for coming in, Kristin.

15:06.795 --> 15:09.512
How are you feeling?

15:09.514 --> 15:12.074
Uh, you know, same. (CHUCKLES)

15:12.076 --> 15:13.808
- Mm.
- Actually, pretty busy, so...

15:13.810 --> 15:15.685
Okay, excuse me, excuse
me, Kristin. (CLEARS THROAT)

15:15.687 --> 15:18.429
It's come to our attention that, uh,

15:18.431 --> 15:20.264
- maybe you're using your, uh...
- Condition.

15:20.266 --> 15:21.432
Yeah, condition. Thank you.

15:21.434 --> 15:22.934
To, uh...

15:22.936 --> 15:24.453
- let's say...
- Take advantage.

15:24.455 --> 15:25.871
Take advantage.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.107
- Of our clientele.
- Mm-hmm.

15:29.109 --> 15:31.484
Uh-huh.

15:31.835 --> 15:35.243
We've seen discrepancies
in your behavior.

15:35.245 --> 15:38.375
One minute you're barely able
to walk across the restaurant,

15:38.377 --> 15:39.709
- the next minute...
- And the next minute,

15:39.711 --> 15:41.160
you're kicking a Hacky Sack around

15:41.162 --> 15:43.621
like you're at a Grateful Dead concert.

15:43.623 --> 15:47.042
So that's why you called me up here?

15:47.044 --> 15:48.051
You guys... (CHUCKLES)

15:48.053 --> 15:50.479
You think I'm taking
advantage of my pregnancy?

15:50.481 --> 15:54.006
- Yes. Yes.
- That's pretty much it, yes.

15:54.008 --> 15:57.135
You're accusing me of
putting on an act to squeeze

15:57.137 --> 15:58.970
a few extra bucks out of my customers.

15:58.972 --> 16:00.179
(LAUGHS)

16:00.181 --> 16:01.973
(SIGHS)

16:01.975 --> 16:04.326
Well...

16:04.328 --> 16:06.411
I am.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.522
Now, look, look, honey, we-we...

16:09.524 --> 16:11.691
Do you have any idea what
it's like to be pregnant?

16:11.693 --> 16:12.734
(CHUCKLES)

16:12.736 --> 16:14.411
Answer me!

16:14.413 --> 16:15.921
(STAMMERING)

16:15.923 --> 16:17.580
C-Carol mentioned it was
a little uncomfortable.

16:17.582 --> 16:19.341
Oh, yeah. You don't sleep.

16:19.343 --> 16:22.177
You get a heartburn without even eating.

16:22.179 --> 16:25.013
The smell of hummus
makes you want to barf.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.498
- Ooh, that's-that's specific.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.191
- People touch your belly without even asking.
- Whoa.

16:30.193 --> 16:33.596
Clothes feel like sandpaper and
you pee every time you cough.

16:33.598 --> 16:36.099
Or laugh, which you never do anymore

16:36.101 --> 16:38.509
because you're pregnant.

16:38.511 --> 16:40.568
The only advantage among

16:40.570 --> 16:42.847
the zillions of disadvantages

16:42.849 --> 16:44.724
is that people feel sorry for you

16:44.726 --> 16:47.443
and they tip a little bit more.

16:47.445 --> 16:48.703
- Oh.
- (CHUCKLES)

16:48.705 --> 16:50.447
(SIGHS) But you're right.

16:50.449 --> 16:53.435
Yeah, that's-that's unprofessional.

16:54.211 --> 16:55.693
Well, that's,

16:55.695 --> 16:57.045
that's sort of a strong word.

16:57.047 --> 16:58.955
- Yeah, I wouldn't put it like that.
- Right.

16:58.957 --> 17:00.715
- Oh, y-you wouldn't?
- No...

17:00.717 --> 17:04.048
No... Uh, so, okay, so if
it's not unprofessional,

17:04.050 --> 17:06.537
then we don't have a problem?

17:06.539 --> 17:09.540
- No, no...
- We're good here, I'm good.

17:09.541 --> 17:11.375
Oh, thank you.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.085
Thank you so much, yes.

17:13.087 --> 17:16.214
Say thank you to Uncle
Ed and Uncle Chuck.

17:23.263 --> 17:24.990
Bring your wallets.

17:27.911 --> 17:29.744
Oh, yes, that's a, that's another thing

17:29.746 --> 17:31.413
about the Baxters, huh?

17:31.415 --> 17:33.874
They're terrifying.

<i>VANESSA: So, Jen,</i>

17:36.402 --> 17:37.827
we want to talk to you about your future

17:40.090 --> 17:42.165
I know. I'm so excited.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.926
Yeah. Not gonna happen.

17:44.928 --> 17:47.411
What? You can't do that.

17:47.413 --> 17:48.562
Of course we can.

17:48.564 --> 17:50.265
America's a-a democracy, for sure,

17:50.267 --> 17:52.084
but in here it's a dictatorship.

17:52.086 --> 17:54.010
- We're co-dictators.
- Mm-hmm.

17:54.012 --> 17:56.905
Look, your father sent you
here to get an education,

17:56.907 --> 17:58.106
not a million followers.

Unbelievable. And I
thought you guys were cool.

Don't feel bad. Our kids frequently made

18:06.510 --> 18:08.617
- that same mistake.

just let me tell you,

I think you'd love it.

18:11.813 --> 18:12.937
Okay, tell us.

18:12.939 --> 18:14.313
I can't really tell you.

18:14.315 --> 18:15.940
I love it.

18:15.942 --> 18:19.151
I mean, I have to show you.

18:19.153 --> 18:22.025
Just keep in mind,
it's only the concept.

18:44.563 --> 18:47.346
And I'm gonna make you love it, too.

18:47.348 --> 18:50.492
Most people think rocks never change.

18:50.494 --> 18:54.353
They just sit there
like, you know, a rock.

18:54.355 --> 18:56.573
Hell, that's kind of cool.

18:56.575 --> 18:59.167
But some do, and you
know who discovered it?

18:59.169 --> 19:02.153
A rocking girl named Florence Bascom.

it was the housekeeper

rhyolite becomes a different
kind of volcanic rock:

holocrystalline.

19:23.384 --> 19:24.884
How much time?

19:24.886 --> 19:28.012
Millions of years.

19:28.014 --> 19:30.699
About as long as it takes
Congress to get anything done.

19:30.701 --> 19:34.226
Yeah. I like that.

19:34.228 --> 19:37.688
As the only woman in her classes
at Johns Hopkins University,

19:37.690 --> 19:41.117
Florence had to sit behind a screen

19:41.119 --> 19:43.211

be distracted by her.

It's really good, Jen. It really is.

20:08.388 --> 20:09.796
- Yeah.
- You really think so?

20:09.798 --> 20:11.740
- Oh, gosh.
- Because I have a lot of other ideas.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.408
You know who you should send this to?

20:13.410 --> 20:15.076
The Geologic Institute?

20:15.078 --> 20:18.270
Yeah, you should send it
to them, but also your dad.

20:18.272 --> 20:20.323
He would be very proud of this.

20:20.325 --> 20:22.608
You know who else would be proud?

20:22.610 --> 20:24.527
Professor Q.

20:24.529 --> 20:26.445
Wow.

20:26.447 --> 20:29.758
See that? You got her all "sedimental".

20:37.291 --> 20:40.084
Sorry, we don't have tacos
and we don't have pizza.

20:40.086 --> 20:42.103
And I think you knew that.

20:42.105 --> 20:45.464
So is there anything on the
menu that you would like?

20:45.466 --> 20:47.258
Okay.

20:47.260 --> 20:49.778
- Ah, it all looks so good.
- Mm.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.762
You know, can I do the,
uh, the short rib plate?

20:51.764 --> 20:53.597
A-And can I make a substitution?

20:53.599 --> 20:55.307
- Sure.
- Okay.

20:55.309 --> 20:57.768
Uh, instead of the short ribs,
can you make that ground beef?

20:57.770 --> 20:59.287
And can you serve that on a tortilla

20:59.289 --> 21:01.456
with some onions and chopped peppers?

21:01.458 --> 21:03.941
Uh-huh.

21:03.943 --> 21:06.110
Yeah, um... You?

21:06.112 --> 21:09.961
Uh, I think... Oof. Ooh, hard.

21:09.963 --> 21:11.490
- Hmm.
- Um, I'll have

21:11.492 --> 21:13.852
the linguine with
marinara, but instead...

21:13.854 --> 21:15.637
Ha, let me guess. Hold the linguine

21:15.639 --> 21:18.456
and put the sauce on one of the
pitas from the falafel plate?

21:18.458 --> 21:20.221
Top it with mozzarella and pepperoni?

21:20.223 --> 21:21.792
That sounds so great. Thank you.

21:21.794 --> 21:25.221
(CHUCKLES) If you guys
wanted pizza and tacos so bad,

21:25.223 --> 21:26.723
why did you come here?

21:26.725 --> 21:29.067
Oh, we have a coupon.

21:30.178 --> 21:32.153
And it's both of our birthdays.

21:32.155 --> 21:34.423
But instead of the free
cake, can we substitute...

21:34.425 --> 21:35.716
Get out.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.268
