00:16.481 --> 00:18.040
Evening, barkeep.

00:18.217 --> 00:20.481
I would like to purchase
some alcohol, please.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.144
Uh-huh. What can I get you?

00:22.356 --> 00:27.421
Well, I'm 26,
as you can see from my license.

00:27.596 --> 00:29.359
Congratulations. What can I get you?

00:30.300 --> 00:31.995
A banana daiquiri, my good man.

00:35.139 --> 00:36.630
I'm Crystal.

00:36.808 --> 00:37.900
What's your name?

00:38.076 --> 00:39.476
Hi, Crystal. I'm Gary.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.179
Gary, I don't wanna embarrass you,
but you are just...

00:43.417 --> 00:45.613
You are just a stunning-Iooking man.

00:45.787 --> 00:47.516
Oh. I know, right?

00:51.027 --> 00:53.292
Ooh. Thanks.

00:54.131 --> 00:56.123
So, Gary,
you having a good time tonight?

00:56.301 --> 00:57.393
Mm.

00:57.568 --> 01:00.937
Thank you for asking, Crystal.
This is like the best night ever.

01:03.543 --> 01:06.342
Do you think
we could make it any better?

01:07.983 --> 01:09.712
Probably, I don't know.

01:12.288 --> 01:14.450
I mean,
do you wanna get out of here?

01:16.461 --> 01:22.129
Well, I kind of like this bar,
and I just ordered this daiquiri.

01:23.370 --> 01:27.034
I mean, do you wanna
get out of here with me?

01:33.917 --> 01:35.351
Are we talking about sex?

01:36.220 --> 01:37.586
Well, I...

01:39.958 --> 01:43.087
Yeah. I suppose we are.

01:44.932 --> 01:48.926
Crystal, I would love
to have the sex with you.

01:51.007 --> 01:53.533
Great. Then let's go.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.219
- Love that jacket on you, by the way.
Thanks.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.787
Actually, the whole outfit is new.

02:24.384 --> 02:26.376
Dean and Sammy Winchester.

02:27.288 --> 02:28.619
So how long has it been?

02:28.823 --> 02:30.951
- Summer before sixth grade.
Mm. I remember.

02:31.126 --> 02:33.652
You assigned yourself
your own reading list.

02:34.064 --> 02:36.625
That's right. I forgot about that.

02:37.902 --> 02:40.531
Your mom happens to be
the best babysitter we ever had.

02:41.140 --> 02:45.168
Well, when I was a maid
at the Mayflower, out on the interstate.

02:45.412 --> 02:47.347
Long before you were even an idea.

02:47.549 --> 02:51.452
Their daddy used to pass through town
and leave the boys with me...

02:51.620 --> 02:54.055
...while he went off to work.

02:54.658 --> 02:56.593
One time,
he was gone for two weeks.

02:56.761 --> 02:57.955
Two weeks?
Mm-hm.

02:58.162 --> 03:00.461
Oh, he always came limping back.

03:01.366 --> 03:02.425
He loved you boys.

03:04.671 --> 03:06.503
Do you know
what he did all that time?

03:06.674 --> 03:08.700
Little Sammy kept trying to tell me.

03:08.944 --> 03:12.176
Of course I didn't believe him.
Not at first, anyway.

03:14.885 --> 03:18.947
Katie, our dad, uh, happened to be
an expert at getting rid of ghosts...

03:19.157 --> 03:21.353
...and now so are we.

03:21.594 --> 03:24.223
That's why I called them, sweetie.
They can help us.

03:25.499 --> 03:27.161
Sounds like you guys got a poltergeist.

03:27.368 --> 03:29.529
Started a month or two
after we moved in.

03:29.737 --> 03:32.036
Yeah, at first it was, uh, just bumps...

03:32.241 --> 03:36.646
...and knocks and scratches on the walls
and then it started breaking things.

03:37.181 --> 03:39.343
And then it attacked Katie?

03:39.551 --> 03:41.212
That was two nights ago.

03:42.054 --> 03:43.919
Can you show them, honey?

03:49.197 --> 03:51.359
"Murdered child."

03:55.338 --> 03:56.771
Katie.

03:57.007 --> 04:00.136
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.

04:01.780 --> 04:04.341
Why don't you guys
take yourselves a vacation...

04:04.551 --> 04:07.646
...and, uh, we'll take care of it?
- Ah. Thank you.

04:14.130 --> 04:17.464
Bacon Burger Turbo,
large chili-cheese fry...

04:17.634 --> 04:20.399
...uh, and a HealthQuake Salad Shake.

04:21.707 --> 04:25.872
I know, I know. It's, uh...
Ahem. It's not mine.

04:44.704 --> 04:46.104
Oh, you shake it up, baby.

04:48.775 --> 04:50.937
You know, poltergeist aside,
Donna looked pretty good.

04:51.479 --> 04:54.278
Dude, don't tell me you still got the hots
for our babysitter.

04:54.483 --> 04:56.645
What? No. That's weird.

04:58.556 --> 05:01.458
I'm just saying that she...
You know, she's... She's doing good.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.289
You know,
with her husband and her kid...

05:04.497 --> 05:06.658
...this whole Amityville thing.
They're hanging tough.

05:06.833 --> 05:07.960
Yeah.

05:11.473 --> 05:14.136
You ever think
that you'd want something like that?

05:14.477 --> 05:16.776
Wife, rug rats, the whole nine?

05:18.382 --> 05:20.476
No. Not really my thing anymore.

05:22.287 --> 05:23.653
Yeah.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.683
What have you got?

05:27.627 --> 05:29.493
Uh, well, that house of theirs.

05:29.664 --> 05:33.624
It's old, really old, um, hundreds of years,
and I found a legend.

05:33.802 --> 05:36.033
- It's unconfirmed, but still...
- Saying?

05:36.205 --> 05:37.833
Supposedly, in the 1720s...

05:38.008 --> 05:40.476
...house was owned
by a guy named Isaiah Pickett.

05:40.644 --> 05:44.810
Legend has it, he hung a woman
in his backyard for witchcraft.

05:45.017 --> 05:46.416
Woman named Maggie Briggs.

05:47.154 --> 05:49.851
- Okay, so an angry ghost witch?
- Lf it's true.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.660
- Still doesn't explain "murdered child."
No.

05:53.829 --> 05:55.660
Or where the bitch is buried.

05:55.831 --> 05:58.232
You know,
I mean, it's a long way back...

05:58.401 --> 06:01.394
...but I can see if I can find something
in the town records.

06:01.572 --> 06:03.734
That's worth a shot.

06:05.745 --> 06:08.510
Gary. The curly fries are up.

06:09.249 --> 06:11.115
<i>So any luck?
- Bupkis.</i>

06:11.319 --> 06:13.913
Can't even find proof
a woman named Maggie Briggs existed...

06:14.089 --> 06:16.115
...much less where she was planted.

06:16.325 --> 06:17.520
<i>All right.</i>

06:17.694 --> 06:21.131
<i>Well, we got a minute to breathe here,
so, uh, let's pick it up first thing.</i>

06:21.332 --> 06:23.528
All right, you bet. See you in a few.

06:38.489 --> 06:39.820
What?

06:45.364 --> 06:47.799
No.

07:29.622 --> 07:32.649
Yeah, this is Collins
out on Route 30. I think we got him.

07:32.860 --> 07:37.162
- Mr. Frankel? Mr. Gary Frankel?
- Who?

07:37.366 --> 07:40.962
- Your family's worried sick about you.
- My... My family?

07:41.505 --> 07:43.303
My brother called you?

07:43.508 --> 07:46.069
Come on,
get in before you freeze solid.

08:16.252 --> 08:17.742
Thanks. Uh...

08:19.089 --> 08:21.683
- But, uh, where are we?
- You're home, son.

08:23.528 --> 08:26.123
- No, no, officer. I'm not staying here.
Gary.

08:26.698 --> 08:29.065
Oh, my God. Gary.

08:29.269 --> 08:30.463
- Oh, God. Gary.
- Oh, hey, hey.

08:30.637 --> 08:33.573
- Are you all right?
- Hey, okay, okay, okay.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.767
Oh, my baby.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:35.943 --> 08:37.936
- What's going on here?
- What do you mean?

08:38.147 --> 08:40.308
- Lady, who are you?
Young man, are you drunk?

08:41.385 --> 08:43.547
- And who are you?
Gary?

08:43.755 --> 08:44.949
Are you drunk?

08:45.156 --> 08:46.385
Answer your father.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.317
My father?

08:50.430 --> 08:51.954
Look, l...

08:59.108 --> 09:01.805
Who is that? Who the hell is that?

09:02.046 --> 09:03.411
He's out of his gourd.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.947
Young man, I'm very surprised at you.

09:06.618 --> 09:07.813
Yeah.

09:07.987 --> 09:09.454
Tell me about it.

09:17.132 --> 09:19.066
Oh, yeah.

09:21.671 --> 09:23.264
Bring it.

09:28.246 --> 09:30.147
Holy crap.

09:31.451 --> 09:33.010
Sam.

09:33.187 --> 09:35.884
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you for hours.

09:36.057 --> 09:37.149
I picked up some food.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.223
Bacon Burger Turbo,
large chili-cheese fry, right?

09:47.773 --> 09:49.934
I'm sorry, man. Really, I just...

09:50.109 --> 09:53.410
I lost track of time.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

09:54.048 --> 09:55.276
Thanks.

09:55.683 --> 09:57.811
Don't know why it took you two hours,
but thanks.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.787
Oh, you're gonna wanna eat that
on the road.

10:00.957 --> 10:02.083
Why?

10:02.258 --> 10:07.721
The maid came in, saw that,
and now they're all kind of freaking out.

10:09.635 --> 10:12.104
- Why did you let the maid in?
- It just happened.

10:14.207 --> 10:16.938
Whatever. I gotta hit the head,
and then we'll take off.

10:17.278 --> 10:18.746
All right. I'll be outside.

10:48.052 --> 10:49.179
Hey. You ready?

10:49.822 --> 10:51.654
Absolutely.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.119
Hey. Can I drive?

11:05.008 --> 11:06.499
Oh. This is so sweet.

11:11.217 --> 11:13.914
You wanna get the lead out, Andretti?
Come on.

11:17.158 --> 11:19.286
Reverse, reverse. You...

11:27.505 --> 11:29.201
It's in reverse.

11:29.407 --> 11:33.538
I am really, really sorry.

11:34.848 --> 11:36.817
Shut up.

11:44.961 --> 11:47.260
<i>This is Dean's other other cell...</i>

11:47.431 --> 11:49.195
<i>... so you must know what to do.</i>

11:49.368 --> 11:52.202
Dean, I've called every phone we got.

11:55.109 --> 11:57.134
Where are you, man?

11:57.745 --> 12:03.447
So this is gonna sound crazy,
really crazy...

12:03.619 --> 12:07.580
...but, um, I think I'm in the wrong body.
Ha, ha.

12:07.759 --> 12:09.158
Could use a little help here.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.494
I think I got asthma.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.798
Call me back.

12:26.984 --> 12:28.577
<i>Lucky Star Motel.</i>

12:28.753 --> 12:31.746
Hello? Uh, could you please
connect me to Room 102?

12:31.924 --> 12:33.221
<i>102?</i>

12:33.392 --> 12:35.953
<i>Ah, no, those guys checked out.
Middle of the night.</i>

12:36.129 --> 12:38.598
Wait. Guys, plural?

12:38.800 --> 12:42.202
<i>Yeah. Uh, one leather jacket,
one sasquatch.</i>

12:42.404 --> 12:44.396
<i>They left.</i>

13:00.495 --> 13:02.691
Who are you?

13:17.318 --> 13:18.478
Smart kid.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.925
Virgin.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.407
Frustrated virgin.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.697
Witchcraft, huh, Gary?

13:54.901 --> 13:57.769
You little satanic bastard.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.741
Gary. Breakfast.

14:00.909 --> 14:02.035
Leave me alone.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.749
Gary!

14:07.517 --> 14:09.782
All right, I'm coming!

14:17.130 --> 14:20.191
So, Gary, I'd like to know
what happened last night.

14:20.368 --> 14:22.530
Heh. So would I, believe me.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.764
I mean, what happened with the plan,
buddy?

14:25.441 --> 14:28.843
- The plan?
- SAT's, MIT, the plan.

14:29.046 --> 14:31.311
You wanna be an engineer,
you need a full ride.

14:31.483 --> 14:34.453
So tell me, how does getting drunk
fit with the plan?

14:34.653 --> 14:36.747
Right, yeah, uh, listen, buddy.

14:37.357 --> 14:41.351
No offense, but at the moment,
I could give a rat's ass about your plan.

14:42.263 --> 14:44.061
Excuse me?

14:46.870 --> 14:48.600
Uh... Huh.

14:49.173 --> 14:54.441
Listen, have I seemed, uh, moody lately?
Withdrawn?

14:54.613 --> 14:56.912
Wow.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.143
Any occult fixations?
- What?

14:59.853 --> 15:02.186
Let me guess. I'm amazing at Latin.

15:02.390 --> 15:04.518
- You have an ear for languages.
- Mm.

15:04.693 --> 15:07.492
Uh, any of the neighborhood pets
go missing recently?

15:07.664 --> 15:11.897
- Are you smoking drugs?
- Leonard, he is not smoking drugs.

15:12.103 --> 15:14.004
Have any of you seen me
with a book?

15:14.206 --> 15:18.166
It'd be big and old, leather-bound.
Maybe some strange writing on it.

15:18.344 --> 15:20.905
Or frankly, I'm probably hiding it.

15:21.415 --> 15:23.509
Gary, no.

15:23.685 --> 15:25.677
- What?
- You're allergic to wheat gluten.

15:44.046 --> 15:45.377
Gluten.

15:45.581 --> 15:47.709
- You've seriously sprung a leak.
- What?

15:47.917 --> 15:50.045
If Mom and Dad found
that creepy old book of yours...

15:50.221 --> 15:53.749
...you'd be grounded for a decade,
and you're bringing it up at breakfast?

15:53.925 --> 15:57.657
So there is a book.
Sydney, where do I keep it?

15:58.665 --> 16:00.860
So, uh, where we going anyway?

16:01.034 --> 16:03.629
To work. The case?

16:03.805 --> 16:04.932
Oh, right. Yeah.

16:05.107 --> 16:06.734
The case. Of course.

16:06.909 --> 16:09.071
Where, uh, do you wanna start?

16:09.246 --> 16:11.715
Well, since you couldn't find
where Maggie Briggs was buried...

16:11.883 --> 16:14.944
...now we have to do a tombstone roll,
see if we can dig her up.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.712
Wait. Maggie Briggs.

16:16.890 --> 16:18.949
You mean, like the witch,
Maggie Briggs?

16:19.125 --> 16:21.720
- Yeah, Sherlock.
- Yeah, she's in the basement.

16:22.964 --> 16:24.488
Come again? What...?

16:24.699 --> 16:26.565
- What basement?
- Isaiah Pickett's house.

16:26.736 --> 16:30.002
Okay, there's this legend
that he hung her, but he didn't.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.574
The real truth is, is that she was carrying
his illegitimate child...

16:33.745 --> 16:36.772
...and he killed her,
and then buried her in the basement.

16:38.118 --> 16:39.142
The murdered child.

16:40.287 --> 16:42.313
That explains the scratches.
How do you know this?

16:42.490 --> 16:44.516
Oh, I've done
all kinds of research on it.

16:46.295 --> 16:48.355
I mean, you know, last night.

16:50.099 --> 16:51.795
Yeah.

16:53.103 --> 16:54.503
Nice work, I guess.

16:59.913 --> 17:01.278
Oh, man, turn it up.

17:03.851 --> 17:06.343
- Seriously?
- Hell, yeah.

17:07.289 --> 17:09.451
<i>You can come back, baby
Rock 'n' roll never forgets</i>

17:23.676 --> 17:25.907
Dean. Someone has stolen my body.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.073
The guy right next to you is not me.

17:29.652 --> 17:32.884
Check your frigging voicemail.
Damn it.

17:33.057 --> 17:35.355
Gary?
- Are you okay?

17:35.827 --> 17:37.056
Yeah, I'm Gary. Uh...

17:38.397 --> 17:39.660
Gary is okay.

17:40.533 --> 17:43.594
So we're referring to ourselves
in the third person now?

17:43.804 --> 17:45.932
We heard about last night.
What happened?

17:46.174 --> 17:47.869
Got drunk. No big thing.

17:48.076 --> 17:49.942
- Look, uh, what's my locker number?
- Heh.

17:50.179 --> 17:51.579
What...? Are you still drunk?

17:51.815 --> 17:54.045
Yeah, yeah.
I see, like, three of you right now.

17:54.219 --> 17:56.881
Um, so, what's my locker number?

18:36.407 --> 18:37.739
Oh, no, Gary.

18:40.146 --> 18:43.139
This is a very, very bad book.

19:09.852 --> 19:13.016
Boo-yah. Master Chief is in the house,
biz-atches.

19:14.024 --> 19:16.493
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

19:26.674 --> 19:27.732
Well, I'll be damned.

19:29.745 --> 19:31.212
Willow moss.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.439
Yeah. Right.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.949
It's, uh, supposed to grow
over witches' graves, right?

19:40.058 --> 19:41.526
Yeah.

20:16.207 --> 20:20.407
- Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this.
- Sorry about what?

20:23.617 --> 20:24.948
Sam!

20:29.057 --> 20:30.992
- Are you okay?
- Let's get the hell out of here.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.892
Whoa. We still gotta burn the body,
you idiot. Come on.

21:03.670 --> 21:07.334
Dude, that was sweet.

21:18.055 --> 21:20.354
- Hey, Gary, wait up.
- Where are you going?

21:20.592 --> 21:21.651
I got something to do.

21:21.861 --> 21:23.692
You're skipping class. You?

21:23.863 --> 21:27.301
I'm just not feeling like myself, okay?

21:27.502 --> 21:29.663
Well, whatever it is,
we can talk it out, bro.

21:29.837 --> 21:32.807
- Come with us.
- I don't have time. I gotta go, I'm sorry.

21:35.478 --> 21:36.946
TREVOR Hey.

21:40.619 --> 21:42.177
Trevor.

21:42.354 --> 21:44.880
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Unh.

21:52.802 --> 21:56.136
- Here you go, guys.
- You know, do me a favor, sweetheart.

21:56.340 --> 21:59.333
Would you bring me a cheeseburger
with extra bacon?

21:59.877 --> 22:02.073
- Fry an egg on top, would you?
- Absolutely.

22:02.247 --> 22:04.409
Well, that sounds good. Ditto.

22:05.051 --> 22:06.678
Be right back with your order.

22:08.489 --> 22:11.391
Okay, who are you
and what have you done with Sam?

22:11.560 --> 22:13.529
What do you mean?

22:15.231 --> 22:17.894
Bacon cheeseburgers now?

22:18.402 --> 22:20.394
I don't know. I eat them, don't I?

22:20.572 --> 22:22.438
Anyways, we are celebrating.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.736
Yeah, I guess.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.838
Another one bites the dust.
Nice work today.

22:29.017 --> 22:30.041
You too.

22:30.218 --> 22:33.416
Had a really awesome day, man.
Seriously.

22:40.465 --> 22:42.126
Ooh.

22:42.401 --> 22:43.801
Sweet.

22:43.970 --> 22:45.938
- A really awesome day?
- Yeah, why not?

22:46.406 --> 22:48.068
It was a random D-list ghost hunt.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.074
That's...? That's awesome to you?

22:51.279 --> 22:52.542
I can't be in a good mood?

22:54.950 --> 22:57.215
Yeah, I guess, just...

22:57.387 --> 23:00.551
No, actually.
It's not really your style, Sam.

23:02.327 --> 23:03.988
Well, then it's a new me.

23:04.329 --> 23:06.321
I mean, come on,
why shouldn't I be happy?

23:06.499 --> 23:13.407
I've got a gun, I'm getting drunk,
and I look like this.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.104
Ah, I don't know.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.977
You ever feel like your whole future
is being decided for you?

23:21.986 --> 23:24.421
Uh, yeah, Sam, I feel like that a lot.

23:24.590 --> 23:27.958
No matter how much you fight it,
you can't stop the plan.

23:28.128 --> 23:31.155
Stupid, stupid plan.

23:31.332 --> 23:32.527
So I don't know.

23:32.735 --> 23:34.498
I guess it's, uh, just nice to do...

23:34.670 --> 23:37.504
...a little ass kicking for a change,
that's all.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.605
Uh, you know what? L... I'm drunk.

23:43.782 --> 23:46.479
Ha, ha. Sorry, just forget it.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.451
No, no, it's all right, it's, uh...

23:51.292 --> 23:52.350
I'll drink to that.

23:58.969 --> 24:02.303
Wow, you know, is it just me,
or are we actually drinking together?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.300
We don't do it that often, huh?

24:04.510 --> 24:06.411
Yeah, you could say that.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.575
Well, we should.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.311
You're a good guy, Dean.

24:10.785 --> 24:12.811
Oh, you are drunk.

24:13.021 --> 24:15.047
- Here you go.
Mm.

24:16.058 --> 24:18.323
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

24:18.495 --> 24:20.486
No, but I mean it.

24:21.733 --> 24:23.827
You really are a good guy.

24:28.408 --> 24:29.500
Mm!

24:31.112 --> 24:33.638
The bread alone...

24:33.816 --> 24:35.340
Mm!

24:46.833 --> 24:49.928
- Love that jacket on you, by the way.
Thanks.

24:50.871 --> 24:54.900
Actually, the whole outfit is new.

25:03.856 --> 25:06.051
We're gonna do it.

25:28.755 --> 25:30.313
Hey.

25:30.490 --> 25:32.254
What the hell is going on?

25:32.426 --> 25:33.757
You can scream all you want.

25:33.929 --> 25:37.593
No one can hear you.
My parents are out of town.

25:38.401 --> 25:40.267
- Gary.
- T, what up?

25:40.437 --> 25:41.927
<i>Where are you?</i>

25:42.139 --> 25:45.632
Uh, I can't really tell you right now.
But, man, you wouldn't believe it.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.370
Well, now, where's Dean?

25:48.547 --> 25:51.449
Uh, the Cloverleaf on Route 6. Why?

25:51.652 --> 25:54.315
<i>- You mean, you haven't killed him yet?
What?</i>

25:54.522 --> 25:57.458
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, what do you mean, kill Dean?

25:57.960 --> 26:00.293
- Building up to it.
- Look, Gary, we got problems here.

26:00.497 --> 26:06.495
For one, I'm looking at your body
right now with this other dude in it.

26:07.573 --> 26:09.370
- What?
- Yeah, he's been in your house.

26:09.542 --> 26:12.535
- He's hanging out with your parents.
- Okay, just calm down.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.675
<i>Whatever he says,
no one is gonna believe him, right?</i>

26:15.850 --> 26:17.045
I mean, we're still good.

26:17.219 --> 26:19.518
Will you hurry up
and kill the son of a bitch?

26:19.723 --> 26:22.557
<i>- Don't rush me, I'll do it.
Yeah, you better.</i>

26:24.762 --> 26:27.391
Uh, gotta go.

26:31.237 --> 26:33.866
Oh, man, I am in way over my head.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.334
I don't think he's gonna do it.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.674
Just relax.
This is Gary we're talking about.

26:39.849 --> 26:42.341
What the hell is going on here?
How do you know who Dean is?

26:42.553 --> 26:44.454
Everybody knows Dean.

26:44.622 --> 26:46.112
He's hell's most wanted.

26:47.393 --> 26:49.384
Oh, no, no.

26:49.562 --> 26:52.054
Have you idiots
been talking to demons?

26:52.265 --> 26:53.324
Oh, right, we're the idiots.

26:55.069 --> 26:56.196
You're just kids.

26:56.372 --> 26:58.533
You have no idea
what you're messing with.

26:58.707 --> 27:01.074
Well, we know
that there's a price on Dean's head.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.713
And we're the ones
that are gonna collect.

27:03.881 --> 27:05.907
What's that supposed to mean?

27:06.952 --> 27:08.750
About a month ago,
we were down here...

27:08.921 --> 27:10.252
- Nora.
- What?

27:10.423 --> 27:12.654
We're not allowed to talk about him?

27:13.660 --> 27:15.561
We were down here
goofing around with that book.

27:15.730 --> 27:20.065
Um, yeah, I wouldn't exactly call praying
to our dark overlord goofing around.

27:20.269 --> 27:22.602
- Don't be a loser, Trev.
- Yeah, Trev.

27:22.773 --> 27:25.242
Anyway, all of a sudden,
the lights flickered...

27:25.410 --> 27:28.903
...and Gary went
into this weird trance.

27:29.114 --> 27:33.177
He closed his eyes,
picked up a pencil and drew this.

27:34.688 --> 27:36.316
And you know what's really weird?

27:36.792 --> 27:38.761
Gary can't draw.

27:38.928 --> 27:40.953
He said he heard a voice in his head.

27:41.130 --> 27:43.463
The demons were putting out a bounty
on this guy.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.135
- A bounty?
Yeah.

27:45.336 --> 27:48.773
To, like, every witch or Satanist
across the whole country.

27:48.941 --> 27:50.533
But Gary...

27:50.709 --> 27:52.837
Gary's the one who spotted you.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.015
<i>And the Freaky Friday crap?</i>

27:55.216 --> 27:57.208
Another spell from the book.
Gary's idea.

27:57.453 --> 27:59.853
Go in, Trojan-horse style.

28:00.690 --> 28:01.884
He's really smart.

28:02.092 --> 28:04.220
That is, if he has the beanbags
to go through with it.

28:04.395 --> 28:06.364
Listen to me.

28:06.531 --> 28:09.501
You are making a terrible mistake.

28:09.669 --> 28:13.401
We're talking about a demon deal,
killing somebody.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.973
This isn't a game.

28:16.144 --> 28:21.413
You're crossing a line
you won't come back from, believe me.

28:26.991 --> 28:29.859
- What?
- Nothing, I...

28:30.830 --> 28:33.664
Nora, don't tell me
you're actually listening to this jerk?

28:33.834 --> 28:35.529
I don't know.

28:35.703 --> 28:38.264
- Maybe. What if he has a point?
- I don't believe this.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.204
First, Gary. Now you?

28:40.376 --> 28:42.173
I can't...

28:46.951 --> 28:49.216
You know what? Fine.

28:49.955 --> 28:51.513
You want something done right?

28:51.691 --> 28:54.524
What, you're gonna go
kill Dean yourself, tough guy?

28:55.029 --> 28:57.224
Don't have to. I can do this.

28:59.434 --> 29:01.096
No, no, no, you can't be serious.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.204
I'm calling up one of these bad boys...

29:03.373 --> 29:05.535
...turning these punks over
and getting paid.

29:05.709 --> 29:07.041
Dollar, dollar bills, y'all.

29:07.212 --> 29:09.407
I really don't think
that that's a good idea.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.379
It's not. It's a very, very bad idea.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.382
No one asked you.

29:59.448 --> 30:01.541
You're not Sam.

30:01.784 --> 30:02.842
Who the hell are you?

30:03.620 --> 30:05.111
Ow.

30:05.990 --> 30:07.788
Don't do this. I'm begging you.

30:07.959 --> 30:09.551
Trevor, I think he's right.

30:09.761 --> 30:11.787
Hey, you wanna get into Vassar,
don't you?

30:11.964 --> 30:13.124
Please.

30:13.332 --> 30:15.858
Stop. You're gonna get us all killed.

30:27.718 --> 30:29.084
Maybe I said it wrong.

30:31.423 --> 30:33.585
- Nora?
- No, no, no, don't touch her.

30:33.826 --> 30:35.556
Nora, you okay?

30:37.665 --> 30:39.190
Oh, yeah.

30:39.701 --> 30:41.693
I'm peachy.

30:47.445 --> 30:50.973
So, what did you call me here for,
skippy?

30:51.150 --> 30:52.515
Unless...

30:53.887 --> 30:55.582
It's dinner time?

30:55.755 --> 30:56.814
What? Uh...

30:56.991 --> 30:59.552
No.

31:00.395 --> 31:03.229
We have Dean Winchester.

31:03.733 --> 31:05.462
You do?

31:05.636 --> 31:06.830
Where?

31:07.004 --> 31:09.439
Trevor, keep your mouth shut.

31:10.075 --> 31:14.012
The Cloverleaf Motel over on Route 6.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.282
Sam?

31:19.520 --> 31:20.954
Is that you in there?

31:25.929 --> 31:29.889
Well, aren't you just 98 pounds
of nothing.

31:31.503 --> 31:32.993
The kid is a moron.

31:33.973 --> 31:36.032
He doesn't have any idea
where Dean is.

31:38.512 --> 31:43.975
So if Sam's in this body,
who's in Sam's?

31:46.022 --> 31:47.148
A dangerous warlock...

31:50.495 --> 31:52.054
...named Gary.

31:53.132 --> 31:54.156
You mean to tell me...

31:54.334 --> 31:58.567
...you've got Dean Winchester
and Sam Winchester's meat suit?

32:00.475 --> 32:04.879
An empty vessel
just waiting to be filled.

32:05.047 --> 32:07.573
And you're handing them both
over to me?

32:07.751 --> 32:09.982
Uh, yeah, I guess.

32:10.155 --> 32:15.355
Ha, ha. Well, I gotta hand it to you.

32:17.364 --> 32:18.490
I'm impressed.

32:20.067 --> 32:22.127
Thanks. Um...

32:22.304 --> 32:25.536
...so if you don't mind my asking...

32:26.609 --> 32:28.840
...there's a reward?

32:29.013 --> 32:30.446
Sure.

32:30.614 --> 32:34.416
My undying gratitude.

32:40.295 --> 32:42.855
- What, are you serious?
- Be quiet, you idiot.

32:43.032 --> 32:44.727
Consider yourself lucky, kid.

32:49.039 --> 32:50.598
Uh, wait a minute.

32:51.108 --> 32:55.809
We worked our asses off here,
and, uh, I want my reward.

33:06.295 --> 33:07.422
Please. Heh.

33:09.299 --> 33:10.323
Okay.

33:12.403 --> 33:15.532
I'm sorry, you're right.

33:15.741 --> 33:17.539
What can I get you?

33:19.547 --> 33:21.071
Well, how about a million bucks?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.741
Oh, for God's sake, Trevor,
just shut up and run.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.911
A million doesn't buy you much
these days.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.750
- Why not make it 10?
- Okay, 10 mil.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.560
And I want...

33:32.597 --> 33:35.328
I want Mindy Schwartz
to fall in love with me.

33:36.269 --> 33:38.670
Love, money.

33:38.872 --> 33:40.362
Sticking to the basics.

33:40.607 --> 33:42.132
I can respect that.

33:43.811 --> 33:45.370
But here's my counter.

34:02.203 --> 34:03.465
Yum.

34:03.638 --> 34:06.403
Tastes like moron.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.215
<i>You have 38 messages.</i>

34:14.386 --> 34:17.150
<i>This is gonna sound crazy, really crazy...</i>

34:17.322 --> 34:19.985
<i>... but I think, uh, I'm in the wrong body.
Ha, ha.</i>

34:21.795 --> 34:25.824
<i>Dean, the guy right next to you
is not me.</i>

34:28.938 --> 34:32.534
<i>Dean, check your frigging voicemail.
Damn it.</i>

34:38.016 --> 34:39.882
Start talking or I start waterboarding.

34:40.053 --> 34:41.851
Oh, my God. Please don't hurt me, please.

34:42.056 --> 34:43.683
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

34:43.891 --> 34:45.792
Okay. Hey, pull it together, champ.

34:46.261 --> 34:48.196
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

34:48.898 --> 34:49.922
Where's Sam?

34:50.100 --> 34:53.434
In my friend's basement.
His parents are out of town.

34:54.039 --> 34:55.199
Parents?

34:55.407 --> 34:56.704
How old are you?

34:56.875 --> 34:59.106
- I'm 17.
- Seventeen?

35:00.247 --> 35:01.407
Huh.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.486
Nora?

35:12.597 --> 35:14.497
Not at the moment.

35:21.776 --> 35:23.641
Phew!

35:32.656 --> 35:34.488
Damn it.

35:39.498 --> 35:43.095
Boy, you earned your dessert tonight,
kiddo.

35:43.805 --> 35:47.298
Tell me, what is it you want?

35:47.476 --> 35:50.037
- Anything.
- Anything?

35:53.751 --> 35:55.481
Lay it on me.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.746
I wanna be a witch.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.857
For real and really powerful.

36:00.026 --> 36:01.790
Hmm. Good choice.

36:02.529 --> 36:04.293
I get it.

36:04.632 --> 36:10.573
No daddy, no MIT, no plan.

36:10.774 --> 36:13.300
You get to be big and strong...

36:13.478 --> 36:15.708
...and no one can tell you
what to do anymore.

36:17.850 --> 36:21.548
There's just one small formality first.

36:24.191 --> 36:25.523
You gotta meet the boss.

36:26.661 --> 36:27.719
The boss?

36:27.896 --> 36:30.024
You know, your satanic majesty...

36:30.199 --> 36:32.566
...or whatever the kids
are calling it these days.

36:34.539 --> 36:36.234
- The devil?
- Mm.

36:37.843 --> 36:38.969
Uh...

36:39.145 --> 36:41.706
No, okay. Um...

36:42.415 --> 36:45.908
It's okay.
I don't really wanna bother him.

36:46.087 --> 36:48.386
Oh, but he's gonna wanna meet you.

36:49.424 --> 36:52.292
Relax, it'll be easy.

36:52.462 --> 36:55.023
He's just gonna ask you
one little question...

36:55.199 --> 36:57.532
...and all you gotta do is say yes.

36:58.905 --> 37:03.366
And then you get your reward.

37:20.867 --> 37:24.065
- What was that?
- Uh, nothing.

37:24.271 --> 37:28.971
Were you trying to exorcise me,
you little piece of crap?

37:56.180 --> 37:57.273
Adios, bitch.

37:57.949 --> 37:59.781
<i>Uh, it's audi nos.</i>

38:50.752 --> 38:54.154
- So we good?
- Yeah, we're good.

38:54.324 --> 38:55.952
Oh, man, it's nice to be back.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.253
Yeah, awesome.

38:59.998 --> 39:03.663
- So, ahem, Gary...
- Yeah, I know.

39:04.504 --> 39:05.869
My bad.

39:07.075 --> 39:08.474
My bad?

39:10.446 --> 39:12.711
Kid, "my bad" ain't gonna cut it.

39:12.882 --> 39:15.943
See, if you were of voting age...

39:16.120 --> 39:18.954
...you'd be dead,
because we would kill you.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.990
So either you straighten up and fly right,
or we will kill you.

39:25.733 --> 39:27.633
Are we clear?

39:28.303 --> 39:29.361
- Crystal.
- Good.

39:44.657 --> 39:45.681
Crap.

39:45.859 --> 39:50.662
Gary,
take it from someone who knows.

39:51.199 --> 39:52.394
Chin up, man.

39:52.635 --> 39:53.897
Your life ain't that bad.

39:54.070 --> 39:55.766
Uh, you met my parents.

39:55.939 --> 39:57.702
Yeah, so what? It's your life.

39:57.875 --> 40:01.175
You don't like their plan for you,
tell them to cram it.

40:01.347 --> 40:02.371
Rebel a little bit.

40:02.548 --> 40:07.179
In a healthy non-satanic way,
of course.

40:13.763 --> 40:16.231
By the way,
you know why Nora's into witchcraft?

40:16.399 --> 40:18.960
- What do you mean?
- She doesn't like Satan, you moron.

40:19.170 --> 40:21.105
She likes you.

40:21.273 --> 40:23.970
Really? You think?

40:24.210 --> 40:26.042
Yeah, I know.

40:26.213 --> 40:28.808
I'm telling you, kid,
I wish I had your life.

40:29.284 --> 40:30.911
You do?

40:31.419 --> 40:32.978
Thanks.

40:34.490 --> 40:36.220
Get on out of here.

40:45.004 --> 40:47.235
That was a nice thing to say.

40:49.076 --> 40:51.170
Totally lied.

40:51.346 --> 40:53.110
Kid's life sucked ass.

41:05.765 --> 41:08.131
All that apple pie, family crap?
It's stressful.

41:08.302 --> 41:10.736
Trust me,
we didn't miss a damn thing.

41:11.172 --> 41:13.505
Or we don't know
what we're missing.

41:18.983 --> 41:20.679
Oh, come on, man. Turn it down.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.583
Welcome back, Kotter.

41:26.760 --> 41:30.629
