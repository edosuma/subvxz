WEBVTT

00:24.566 --> 00:25.567
Elaine.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.360
Hello, Hunter.
Hi, everybody.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.154
I'm just gonna sit
and listen for today,

00:29.237 --> 00:30.488
but I want to thank you

00:30.572 --> 00:32.115
for welcoming me
with such open arms.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.617
I'm used to Hollywood divas,
so it's nice

00:34.701 --> 00:37.120
to be around some real
meat-and-potato mensches.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.039
Okay. Now I'm done.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.331
Thank you, Elaine.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.834
We are humbled
to have you in our midst.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.544
But enough with the niceties.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.296
We have a ship
to put back on course.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.630
I'm not getting any younger.

00:47.714 --> 00:52.260
In fact, you're just in time
for my 70th birthday party.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.720
Gulp.

00:53.803 --> 00:58.892
Poland, where are we
with, uh...the jazz priest?

00:58.975 --> 01:01.061
Uh, I--

01:03.021 --> 01:04.230
I couldn't do it, sir.

01:05.272 --> 01:08.193
That's not really
an acceptable answer.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.195
Have you ever fired a priest?

01:10.278 --> 01:11.696
Try firing a rabbi.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.990
It's only gonna get worse,
I'm afraid.

01:14.074 --> 01:18.328
Don't say anything yet,
but Albert's probably next.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.288
Poor man. That won't be pretty.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.791
But seriously,
we can't get big results

01:22.874 --> 01:25.335
without taking
some big swings...

01:25.418 --> 01:26.878
of the ax.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.926
Brave choices,
braver content.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.803
That's Murrow, and that's you.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.304
And that's Elaine.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.139
Exciting.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.643
Now, the real news, of course,
is that Julia will be back

01:41.726 --> 01:43.144
at the beginning of next week.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.354
Is that not thrilling?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.106
Totally not thrilling.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.068
Russ, I just wanted
to introduce you to Elaine,

01:50.151 --> 01:51.444
our new director
for "The French Chef."

01:51.527 --> 01:53.113
Oh, hey.
Nice to meet you.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.864
Russ Morash.
Welcome aboard.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.616
Oh. Well, thank you.
Big shoes to fill.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.369
Ah, I appreciate it,
but they're more medium-sized.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.954
Hey, can I ask you something?

02:01.037 --> 02:01.955
Hmm?

02:02.038 --> 02:02.956
Do I have a look?

02:03.039 --> 02:04.749
What's my persona?

02:04.833 --> 02:06.543
For my show.

02:06.626 --> 02:10.088
Am I a shirt-and-tie guy?
Turtleneck guy?

02:10.170 --> 02:12.549
- Flannel guy?
- Hmm.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.969
Um...you know, I think
they're all great,

02:16.052 --> 02:19.639
but the secret is
to just be yourself.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.141
That's the look.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.268
Uh, yeah.
What, uh--what she said.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.656
I thought it would save us
some time in the planning.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.617
A culinary journey
through Provence

02:39.701 --> 02:41.703
in nine dishes
and five courses.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.456
It's a narrative, really,
of our visit together.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.962
I was busy last night too.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.591
And not a single dish
in common.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.138
Simca, this is
our last meal together,

03:00.221 --> 03:01.931
no matter what we serve.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.683
And I will cry
when it's over.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.020
More if we use your menu.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.313
But either way.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.024
Then let's make it
a celebration, not a quarrel.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.859
We have, after all, assembled

03:12.942 --> 03:15.528
a motley crew
of sui generis-ness

03:15.612 --> 03:18.406
to send us off to Judith Jones.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.285
What now?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.915
I have a thought.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.210
Bon appétit.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.087
Simca and I have
figured it all out.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.297
We each make all the dishes
on our own menu,

03:34.381 --> 03:37.926
and the guests will vote
on which dishes should be

03:38.009 --> 03:39.678
included in Volume II.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.721
That's a bit of genius.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.848
How many dishes is that?

03:43.932 --> 03:45.934
Nearly two dozen.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.228
These are the dishes
you don't agree on.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.063
How many dishes
do you agree on?

03:50.146 --> 03:52.440
Oh, more than you can count.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.900
Oh, not quite that many.

03:57.570 --> 04:02.575
In three months,
out of the 200 recipes we need,

04:02.659 --> 04:06.663
you two have settled on,
say, 20?

04:08.331 --> 04:10.208
Optimistically.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.168
To which you now propose
to add

04:12.252 --> 04:14.879
a dinner's worth of maybes?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.589
And may the best man win!

04:19.134 --> 04:20.760
Why are we playing
parlor games?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.971
Why not put all the dishes
in the book?

04:23.054 --> 04:26.599
Because they don't work
in an American kitchen, Judith.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.186
Try telling an American housewife
to go strangle a duck.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.480
I came here
for some relief, Julia,

04:32.564 --> 04:35.066
not to play referee
between the two of you.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.986
Not with Blanche
breathing down my--

04:38.069 --> 04:39.279
oh.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.031
Oh, my God.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.324
Oh, it's heavenly, isn't it?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.826
It's so nutty and soft.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.619
You must try the Lupara next.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.787
No.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.582
I will not be seduced
by chèvre.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.875
You promised me, Julia.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.044
You promised.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.921
Yes, I know,
and I'm so remorseful.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.133
But I was seduced
by Simca's hospitality.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.553
All other faults aside,
she is my delightful sister.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.139
But now that you're here,
Judith, we will both step to it.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.350
- I give my word.
- A little late for that!

05:08.433 --> 05:10.268
I want you to imagine

05:10.352 --> 05:12.020
that I'm raising my voice
at you.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.230
I'm dressing you down.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.274
Which I would be doing
in the worst way,

05:16.358 --> 05:18.109
if my mouth were not so full.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.905
- S'il vous plaît?
- Oui, mademoiselle.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.491
Let me have it, Marian.
I'm very open to notes.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.201
Ugh, don't take this
the wrong way,

05:26.284 --> 05:29.537
but you're not
really likable, Russ.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.332
I'm not likable?
You don't like me?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.918
I love you,
but you're not likable.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.462
I mean, in the way
that Julia is likable.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.422
"I'm your friend.
Spend time with me.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.800
I'm not judging you."

05:41.883 --> 05:43.093
That kind of likable.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.429
Roland thinks I'm likable.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.931
Oh. Well, then.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.936
And now that our duck
is finishing roasting, it's--

05:53.019 --> 05:55.188
it's time for us
to do the sauce.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.482
Now, this recipe
for duck à l'orange

05:57.565 --> 06:00.527
has a sweet and sour caramel

06:00.610 --> 06:03.530
and vinegar and orange peel.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.907
And that's just delicious.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.576
This is a fairly rich dessert.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.246
A light supper,
perhaps a roast chicken,

06:11.329 --> 06:13.748
would make
a perfect accompaniment.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.918
And here I have
a chilled Sauternes,

06:17.002 --> 06:19.212
one of the noble wines
of France,

06:19.295 --> 06:23.717
to drink with our glamorous
mousse à la framboise.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.343
Good evening.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.345
This is Russ Morass.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.098
Russ Morash.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.142
Russ Morash. All right.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.274
No.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.280
Binky. Boochy.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.616
Hello.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.287
This is Russ Morash,
and welcome to "Focus."

06:52.370 --> 06:56.291
Now, our subject this week:

06:56.374 --> 06:57.709
Vietnam.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.421
Our guiding principle:
we inform.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.298
You decide.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.597
It's like you reach
through the camera lens

07:10.680 --> 07:12.349
and grab my heart.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.440
What's going on?

07:20.523 --> 07:21.941
I told you we were hosting

07:22.025 --> 07:24.152
a Jack and Jill party
for your cousin.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.030
- Doesn't she look gorgeous?
- I'm sorry. I forgot.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.407
That's your default
when it comes to family.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.452
Hey, you know what?
I should go.

07:32.534 --> 07:35.705
Why don't you just go inside
and borrow something of mine?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.499
We have different styles.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.417
Yes, we do.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.091
Oh, my God.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.676
What is he doing here?

07:47.759 --> 07:49.094
What is this, an ambush?

07:49.177 --> 07:50.303
You could have warned me.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.263
Well, I didn't expect
Oshkosh.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.976
Um, you remember Alice,
don't you?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.353
Of course I do.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.398
Well, if you'll excuse me,

08:01.481 --> 08:03.316
I'm needed in the kitchen.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.073
Moms, right?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.658
That's generous of you.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.619
What are you doing here?

08:14.703 --> 08:16.996
Uh, my parents told me
to come.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.917
- Oh.
- You, uh--you look nice.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.086
You're a terrible liar.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.171
I worry
for your future clients.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.966
Well, hey.
I'm not looking at the outfit.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.301
Isaac.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.304
So how's the show going?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.390
- What show?
- "The French Chef."

08:36.474 --> 08:37.683
How's Julia?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.477
Oh.
Um, I don't know.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.563
She's still away.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.231
Huh?

08:43.313 --> 08:44.315
All this time?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.151
Yeah.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.738
You could have called me,
let me know.

08:53.616 --> 08:57.245
Okay. So you seeing anyone?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.164
No.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.331
You?

09:00.415 --> 09:02.042
Inconclusive.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.294
20 years' work,
working on something

09:04.377 --> 09:06.838
5 million times smaller
than a pinhead.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.466
You can't trust an atom.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.717
They make up everything.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.385
Ah, you knew that one!

09:12.469 --> 09:14.637
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Excuse me, monsieur.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.348
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.560
Bon appétit.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.570
I don't like
my food to touch.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.197
Ah.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.159
Will you think
I'm totally insane

09:36.242 --> 09:37.827
if I pick off all the parsley?

09:38.536 --> 09:39.788
A little.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.623
But I have grandkids,
so I'm used to it.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.834
Physicists
and schoolchildren.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.295
We don't belong
in grown-up places like this.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.047
Don't be silly.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.632
I think it's cute.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.643
Thank you for a lovely evening.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.022
I've been waiting to do that.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.775
- Can I come in?
- No.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.819
Not yet.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.737
Okay.

10:12.821 --> 10:13.905
I understand.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.199
Can't blame me for trying.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.575
Ah.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.746
I'll see you tomorrow
for Hunter's birthday party.

10:21.830 --> 10:22.997
Great.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.709
You'll meet everyone
except Julia.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.503
The whole "French Chef" gang.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.921
Wonderful.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.426
Counting the minutes.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.760
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.024
Pardon.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.735
I hope you don't mind.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.737
Your garden is so exquisite.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.405
And you are?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.906
I'm a friend of James.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.324
Sam.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.410
James told me
to come meet him here.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.745
You must be Simca.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.871
Oui.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.414
And of course,
you must be Julia.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.790
How do you know James?

11:05.874 --> 11:08.460
We met at a gallery.
I'm an artist.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.045
An artist!
How wonderful.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.965
My husband's an artist.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.508
Really?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.218
Oh.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.803
Mmm. Oh.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.513
Sam, this is marvelous.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.390
It's the traditional breakfast
of my country.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.642
I want to move
to your country.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.935
And the coffee.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.855
So strong,
with just a touch of--

11:28.938 --> 11:30.273
what is that?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.484
- Cardamom.
- Ah. I thought so.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.071
Shash--shashush--shush--

11:36.154 --> 11:38.031
- Shakshuka.
- Shakshuk--

11:38.114 --> 11:40.533
- Shakshuka.
- Chakchuka.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.912
- Shakshuka-shuka-shuka.
- Shakshuka!

11:46.581 --> 11:48.415
- More?
- No, no, no, merci.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.421
I see what you're doing.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.800
Weaseling your way
into people's heart.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.176
Pinkie promise.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.221
No cheating today
on the contest.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.472
Oh, Simca.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.723
Who do you think I am?

12:03.807 --> 12:04.891
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.601
This is not a promise.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.814
More, please.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.107
Don't be shy.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.400
I've had shakshuka before.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.235
This is a revelation.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.737
We're both artists, then.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.495
Oh!

12:25.578 --> 12:26.538
He's here.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.543
- James!
- Julia!

12:31.626 --> 12:32.585
Oh, James.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.671
Too long. Too long.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.131
Oh, where are my manners?

12:36.214 --> 12:39.718
Permit me to introduce
my waltz partner across Europe,

12:39.801 --> 12:41.094
Francis Field.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.762
- Hey there.
- Lovely to meet you.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.806
Lucky for her
and luckier for me,

12:44.889 --> 12:47.517
Franny is a steel heiress
from Ohio.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.395
Well, I don't know
how lucky the Ohio part is,

12:50.478 --> 12:52.355
but the rest of it's
pretty great.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.567
Enchantée, madame.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.278
Your other guest arrived
before you.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.404
My other guest?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.947
I thought
you'd never get here.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.658
Sam.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.493
Why are you always sadder
to leave me

13:05.577 --> 13:06.911
than excited to see me?

13:06.995 --> 13:09.706
You must grow on me
over time.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.250
We met at a beach on--

13:12.334 --> 13:13.418
in Antibes.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.961
Oh.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.088
I'm sorry,
I just have to say

13:17.172 --> 13:20.633
that I have seen every episode
of your program

13:20.717 --> 13:22.469
and to thank you so much
for allowing me

13:22.552 --> 13:23.636
to be here this weekend.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.056
Oh, bless you, Francis.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.891
But you're not my guest.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.226
You're Simca's guest.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.686
Oh.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.188
And how do you two
know each other?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.418
Touch more lemon, I think.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.961
Aye, aye, Captain.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.131
This will be cookbook-ready
by the time we're through.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.050
All of these dishes will be.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.599
Shoo!

14:12.310 --> 14:14.854
Did you take my tarragon?

14:14.938 --> 14:16.648
I did not take your tarragon.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.441
I have my own tarragon.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.568
- Oh, you two.
- She took the tarragon.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.321
I don't cook myself,
but I certainly support

14:23.405 --> 14:26.032
those that do
with a voracious appetite.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.076
I can vouch for that.

14:28.159 --> 14:31.079
Has anyone claimed
this gorgeous chicken?

14:31.162 --> 14:34.540
Uh, if it doesn't have an S
or a J on it, it's fair game.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.294
Oh, fair game chicken.
Fair game.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.506
If there are no objections,
I'm going to enter the fray

14:41.589 --> 14:43.550
and present a dish myself.

14:43.633 --> 14:48.138
A free French chicken,
in honor of my friend Franny.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.265
Oh. Fried, please. Fried.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.975
Fried it is.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.476
Will you get a load of me?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.771
Francis Field from Akron, Ohio,
in the south of France,

14:56.855 --> 15:00.900
being cooked for by James Beard
and Julia Child.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.402
It'll be a night to remember.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.654
Oh, I hope so.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.700
Practically everyone I love
is here.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.868
Simca?

15:09.951 --> 15:12.078
Yeah. Yeah, the same.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.164
Who doesn't love Julia Child?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.430
- Hmm?
- Répète.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.652
The leeks are mine, the lamb,
the haricots verts, the squab--

15:44.736 --> 15:46.363
maybe you should
write this down.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.239
If you accidentally vote
for one of hers,

15:48.323 --> 15:50.033
you will be missing
this ridiculous bed

15:50.116 --> 15:53.036
and the furious woman
laying in it.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.586
Franny seems nice.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.880
She's a pistol.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.507
Sam also seems nice.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.092
Hmm.

16:09.344 --> 16:13.348
I didn't realize
that you were quite the cook.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.683
I'm just an amateur.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.310
Fake it till you make it.
That's what I did.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.563
One cook to another,
I'm impressed.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.899
I like doing it.
It relaxes me.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.693
You've been indoctrinated.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.113
Between you and me,

16:28.196 --> 16:30.365
I even helped write
the bread chapter

16:30.448 --> 16:31.700
for the new book.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.035
Bread?
You are killing me.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.286
That is my passion.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.788
Small world.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.540
But don't you see?
That's a sign this time.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.168
We must work together.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.131
The sun at this hour.

16:46.214 --> 16:49.134
You can fry an egg on my face.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.094
Oh. Excuse me.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.388
Oh, I could use a Tums.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.307
Cannonball!

16:58.309 --> 17:00.520
Wow.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.564
He makes quite a splash.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.773
Doesn't he?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.153
You two are together?

17:50.236 --> 17:53.114
Mm.
He's just having some fun.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.116
Hmm.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.576
If that's what you call it.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.913
What do you call it, Paul?

17:59.996 --> 18:02.582
Are you sure you're his type?

18:02.665 --> 18:05.585
Who cares
who's anybody's type?

18:05.669 --> 18:09.589
I get a lot more than sex
from that man.

18:09.673 --> 18:13.176
At my age--
frankly, at any age--

18:13.259 --> 18:16.805
what he gives me
is a whole lot better.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.766
Okay, then.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.440
Oof!

18:27.524 --> 18:29.109
Oh.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.360
Pardon me.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.946
I--I should, uh,
look where I'm going.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.197
No apology.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.824
I'm not injured.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.450
Well--

18:37.534 --> 18:39.285
I'll see you at dinner.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.621
Jim says
you're a photographer,

18:41.705 --> 18:43.707
as well as a painter.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.542
Yes.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.878
Henri Cartier-Bresson.
Brassai.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.463
I'm obsessed with photography.

18:50.547 --> 18:51.923
Ah.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.384
Well, the--the French
are marvelous at it.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.886
Uh, I'm more of a--

18:56.970 --> 18:59.723
a passionate amateur.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.601
Landscapes and architecture
and portraiture.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.521
I've taken quite a few
in the months we've been here.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.858
Then let me be your student.

19:14.738 --> 19:15.905
Bonsoir, madame.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.658
Oh.
Bonsoir, monsieur.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.243
Welcome.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.495
- American?
- Yep.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.622
I rang the doorbell,
but no one answered.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.707
Oh.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.959
All getting ready for dinner,
I'm afraid.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.586
No matter.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.547
I would not have wished to have
been greeted by anyone else.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.049
They will need
no lamps at dinner,

19:34.132 --> 19:35.800
if you are at the table.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.220
That's very good.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.430
Very French.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.057
I'm Belgian, actually.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.100
Like Hercule Poirot.

19:44.184 --> 19:48.480
Jacques Brel, a poor chanteur,
at your service.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.357
Oh, my.
Poor indeed.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.734
I have your album,
Monsieur Brel.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.572
Consider that I sang it
for you, then.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.201
Madame...

20:01.284 --> 20:02.327
Jones.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.204
Judith Jones.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.122
I'm, uh, Simca's editor.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.999
The editor of "Mastering."

20:08.083 --> 20:10.335
Interpreter
of Sartre and Camus.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.045
Simca warned me about you.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.923
Well, that was a long time ago.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.801
We are both in thrall
of words, it seems.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.053
And yet speechless.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.067
Hi, if you're going to bring
your drinks on set,

20:34.150 --> 20:35.944
please consider
using a coaster.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.116
I know you want
to see the sink.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.575
Everybody wants
to see the sink.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.035
Can you blame me?

20:44.119 --> 20:45.745
Can I, please? Yeah?

20:49.457 --> 20:50.834
The R is for Roscoe.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.419
- Edward Roscoe Murrow.
- Oh.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.254
You know, all these years,
never knew that.

20:54.337 --> 20:55.547
I collect minutiae.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.507
Ah, the tchotchkes
of the mind.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.883
How delightfully Jewish.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.636
Um, if you'll excuse me.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.472
Mm. Elaine.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.766
Hi, Roland.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.226
- You know, I was wondering...
- Hmm?

21:08.309 --> 21:09.436
If maybe you and me,

21:09.519 --> 21:11.730
we could go see a movie
or something.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.149
Say, "The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg."

21:14.232 --> 21:16.568
I hear it's very romantic.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.279
Oh.
Um, it's--it's not a good time.

21:19.362 --> 21:20.405
When would be a good time?

21:20.488 --> 21:22.949
Uh, I can't really
give you an ETA.

21:23.033 --> 21:26.703
I'm getting the sense
that I rub you the wrong way.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.665
But all I really want
is to rub you the right way.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.627
Albert.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.756
Avis.

21:37.839 --> 21:41.134
Yes.
Julia's little friend.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.387
And this is
my big friend, Stanley.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.724
Uh, thank you.

21:47.807 --> 21:52.604
Uh, thank you all
for being here with me tonight

21:52.687 --> 21:55.357
to celebrate my 70 years.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.983
How is that even possible?

21:58.443 --> 22:01.237
Uh, you are my family.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.740
You're more than family.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.075
You're my friends.

22:05.158 --> 22:09.329
And I stand here
on this beautiful set,

22:09.412 --> 22:13.708
knowing Julia,
the jewel in our WGBH crown,

22:13.792 --> 22:17.128
will be back where she belongs
in a week's time.

22:18.505 --> 22:22.175
What a thrill
it has been, hasn't it?

22:22.258 --> 22:25.970
To get this little station
to this big moment,

22:26.054 --> 22:30.058
with a show that airs
from sea to shining sea.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.062
Thank you.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.774
On behalf of everyone at WGBH,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.109
thank you, Hunter...

22:39.192 --> 22:40.193
Oh.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.570
For your hard work
and dedication.

22:42.654 --> 22:47.826
Here is a token
of our appreciation.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.411
Mm.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.540
They're--
they're kissing you goodbye!

22:53.623 --> 22:54.582
Uh--

22:54.666 --> 22:56.543
Take the trash
on your way out.

22:56.626 --> 22:57.669
Yeah. Right.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.462
Millie, uh,
ladies and gentlemen!

22:59.546 --> 23:02.507
My--my crazy sister-in-law.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.134
Uh, what a joker.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.440
Thank you, Sam.

23:18.523 --> 23:19.858
Would you mind
switching seats?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.777
Ms. Jones and I were in
the midst of a conversation

23:22.861 --> 23:24.279
that needs completing.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.072
Of course.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.327
Now, I certainly hope

23:31.411 --> 23:33.621
everyone's come prepared
to do their duty.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.749
This is serious business
we're at.

23:35.832 --> 23:39.002
And remember,
every vote counts.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.138
Good.

23:57.896 --> 24:01.024
I've always said if you want
to get to know a person,

24:01.107 --> 24:03.568
take them out to dinner
and watch them eat.

24:04.778 --> 24:08.156
You can't devour life
and nibble at food.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.033
- No.
- Who's nibbling?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.576
More lamb.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.746
Wherever we've gone,
Paul and I,

24:14.829 --> 24:17.624
Europe or Asia or back home,

24:17.707 --> 24:21.294
we've always made friends
over food.

24:21.378 --> 24:23.463
And music.
Don't forget some music.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.674
Sung in French, preferably.

24:25.757 --> 24:29.219
An excess--
an excess of everything.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.222
Now, then, who wants thirds?

24:32.305 --> 24:34.099
More leeks
in the vinaigrette.

24:34.182 --> 24:35.934
- It makes me swoon.
- Aww.

24:37.852 --> 24:39.813
Mmm.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.731
Wow.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.943
You told Sam
the leeks were yours.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.236
I know it.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.988
I saw you two earlier,
whispering away.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.115
Shame on you.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.199
Oh!

24:51.282 --> 24:52.367
Oh, shame on you.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.493
I would never.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.453
He just happened
to like the leeks.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.789
And between you and me,
he's absolutely right.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.207
They're spectacular.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.466
Fully embracing
the party spirit, I see.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.843
What's not to enjoy?

25:09.926 --> 25:11.469
A birthday party
where the guest of honor

25:11.553 --> 25:14.723
would rather be anyplace else,
and no one is using a coaster.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.600
Stanley seems very nice.

25:17.684 --> 25:21.438
Yes.
He's--he's a charmer.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.774
It'll be better
when Julia's back.

25:24.858 --> 25:27.652
Good for her, good for Hunter,
good for morale.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.029
Hear, hear.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.531
And here's to Elaine
joining our ranks.

25:31.614 --> 25:34.701
One of these days,
we're going to outnumber them.

25:37.287 --> 25:39.080
The guys and I
have been talking.

25:40.498 --> 25:44.586
You--you worked
at CBS for Murrow?

25:44.669 --> 25:45.879
I did.

25:45.962 --> 25:48.298
So why would you leave
to come work

25:48.381 --> 25:49.841
at a dinky station like this?

25:49.924 --> 25:52.427
Wow, you and the boys should
work on your self-esteem.

25:52.510 --> 25:56.473
Um...it is none
of your business.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.272
That chicken, James.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.649
Fantastic. Just superb.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.486
Hear, hear.
It was fabulous.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.862
I devoured it.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.449
You're making me blush.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.368
I would like to make a toast

26:16.451 --> 26:19.913
to these two
indefatigable women,

26:19.996 --> 26:24.876
who together made for us
the feast of a century.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.252
- Ah.
- Santé.

26:26.336 --> 26:28.588
- Santé.
- Thank you, my love.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.508
Mmm.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.511
And to think, when I met you,
you didn't know how to cook.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.054
No.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.764
Oh, bullshit.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.058
No, no. It's true. It's true.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.018
When we started dating,
I took her

26:42.102 --> 26:45.313
to all the best restaurants
and salons

26:45.397 --> 26:46.815
and she couldn't
get enough of them.

26:46.898 --> 26:50.568
And then I gave her
"Tropic of Cancer" to read.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.196
Henry Miller?
Why, Paul.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.825
Well, if we were gonna be
in a relationship,

26:56.908 --> 26:59.119
she needed to know
how to feed and fuck.

27:01.830 --> 27:03.832
Well, the fucking
took less time to get

27:03.915 --> 27:05.208
a handle on than the feeding.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.835
Yes. She was a quick study.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.505
And flatter.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.174
To feed, fuck, and flatter.

27:13.258 --> 27:15.427
No, no, no.
I never mentioned flattery.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.053
Oh, no. I intuited it.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.639
Whoa.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.434
Well, Jimmy's chicken is better
than any fuck I've ever had.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.522
It--it was a good chicken.

27:31.234 --> 27:33.903
Show business
is all new to me.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.697
I guess
I'm a little starstruck.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.533
Well, it is GBH.

27:38.616 --> 27:39.951
But the best part

27:40.035 --> 27:42.620
is just getting to spend time
with you.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.289
- Stanley--
- I mean it.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.249
You know what happens
when I look across the room

27:46.332 --> 27:48.001
and I see you?

27:48.084 --> 27:49.419
I get butterflies.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.505
You'd think I were
a young man again.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.467
Butterflies?

27:55.550 --> 27:57.469
How about
if I refill our drinks?

27:57.552 --> 27:58.803
Perfect.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.267
Oh.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.488
Trying to catch a train?

28:16.571 --> 28:17.864
I have a friend in town.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.074
We're meeting up after.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.158
Mm.

28:21.159 --> 28:23.578
I appreciated
how you handled Roland.

28:23.661 --> 28:24.621
Ah.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.122
Mm-hmm.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.957
Why did you come here?

28:31.461 --> 28:33.213
I had an affair with my boss.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.881
I got pregnant.
He broke it off.

28:34.964 --> 28:35.965
I had an abortion.

28:37.384 --> 28:40.595
And one of us had to go,
and it wasn't gonna be him,

28:40.679 --> 28:45.433
so I figured if I'm going,
might as well be far away.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.814
Now you know.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.232
I'll always tell you the truth.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.778
Well, for whatever reason
you came,

28:56.861 --> 28:58.029
it's better
now that you're here.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.282
You seen Avis?

29:01.366 --> 29:02.992
- Uh, no.
- Sorry.

29:03.910 --> 29:08.081
The war was
nearly 20 years ago.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.208
How is that possible?

29:10.291 --> 29:12.711
And then now we have so much.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.755
So much in the same lifetime.

29:15.839 --> 29:18.425
If my hosts will indulge me
in a brief toast,

29:18.508 --> 29:19.843
before the voting begins.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.137
Hear, hear.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.680
Oh.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.641
What a convivial gathering.

29:26.725 --> 29:28.643
What a special evening.

29:28.727 --> 29:31.521
A celebration
for no real reason at all,

29:31.604 --> 29:34.274
which is the very best kind
of celebration.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.903
And you've allowed me
to be a part of it.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.113
Oh.

29:41.573 --> 29:44.200
I seem always to have found
a way to attach myself

29:44.284 --> 29:47.162
to others' celebrations.

29:47.245 --> 29:49.664
Lucky to have
such generous friends.

29:50.665 --> 29:54.002
Maybe in my next life,
if fortune permits,

29:54.085 --> 29:56.671
I will be the one
to throw the party.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.049
And you'll all be invited,
I promise.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.675
Is that a save the date?

30:02.510 --> 30:03.928
Oh, James, who cares?

30:04.012 --> 30:06.431
I mean--I mean,
who cares about the food,

30:06.514 --> 30:08.308
as long as we all get to eat?

30:09.476 --> 30:12.187
Oh, I say
just keep people close

30:12.270 --> 30:15.857
and try to get
as much pleasure as you can.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.317
I mean,
that's what I have to say.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.818
Am I right, Julia?

30:18.902 --> 30:20.528
Oh, yeah.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.906
We're all kept.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.282
Well, from time to time.

30:24.366 --> 30:28.286
I mean, certainly, everybody
around this table is kept.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.080
I know I've been kept.

30:30.163 --> 30:33.249
I was kept by my late husband,
bless his soul.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.127
And James is kept serially.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.171
And, well,
Sam's definitely kept,

30:38.254 --> 30:39.631
and a keeper.

30:39.714 --> 30:42.592
And, Yvette,
I assume you're kept.

30:42.676 --> 30:45.887
And, Paul, well, I guess
you're kept as well.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.473
And we're all born kept.

30:48.556 --> 30:52.769
So good fortune comes and goes.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.229
That's what I have to say.

30:54.312 --> 30:59.025
So here's to sharing
everything we have.

30:59.109 --> 31:00.735
Here's to being kept.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.624
If you'll excuse me.

31:14.708 --> 31:16.376
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.420
- It is getting late.
- Oh.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.255
This is perfect.

31:29.347 --> 31:31.349
Was it something I said?

31:32.726 --> 31:34.894
When the party's over,
it's over.

31:34.978 --> 31:37.022
You just had the last word.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.190
Okay.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.242
Gosh, we never voted.

31:50.410 --> 31:51.536
Oh.

31:56.458 --> 31:57.751
Pan Am. How can I help you?

31:57.834 --> 31:59.210
Oh, thank God.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.087
I wasn't sure anyone would
pick up at this hour.

32:01.171 --> 32:04.841
I'd like to inquire about
a last-minute flight to Paris.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.385
I've got a friend who's
given me an open invitation,

32:07.469 --> 32:10.180
and I daresay
I'm gonna take her up on it.

32:10.263 --> 32:13.266
It's for tomorrow, from Boston.

32:13.350 --> 32:16.019
- Let me see what we have.
- Okay.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.979
Oh, I've got to get away
from Stanley.

32:18.063 --> 32:21.024
- Stanley?
- Oh, he's a lovely man.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.984
Obviously. He's wonderful.

32:23.068 --> 32:27.822
He's smart,
and he's crazy about me.

32:27.906 --> 32:33.453
But, you know, it's one thing
to grow old with someone

32:33.536 --> 32:38.041
but another thing entirely
to date an old man.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.336
This is very--

32:41.419 --> 32:42.545
We're making up
for lost time.

32:44.297 --> 32:46.299
Oh. Do you, um, have something?

32:46.383 --> 32:47.717
Have something? No.

32:49.552 --> 32:51.346
- You're disappointed?
- No, no.

32:51.429 --> 32:53.223
I mean, yes. But--

32:53.306 --> 32:54.891
I mean, if I was the kind
of guy who carried that,

32:54.974 --> 32:55.892
- you wouldn't--
- Right.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.435
I completely respect you
for not having anything.

32:59.020 --> 32:59.979
I was at my mother's.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.189
Yes, of course.
That would be--

33:02.399 --> 33:03.566
And I didn't want to assume,
you know--

33:03.650 --> 33:05.068
I appreciate you
being unprepared.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.152
Next time.

33:06.236 --> 33:07.570
- Yeah. Next time.
- Mm.

33:09.447 --> 33:10.740
Oh, and you can kick me out
whenever you want.

33:10.824 --> 33:11.741
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

33:11.825 --> 33:13.243
- Do you want to kick me out?
- No, I don't.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.369
Me neither.

33:16.413 --> 33:18.832
You edited Sartre
and Camus in your 20s.

33:18.915 --> 33:20.792
I would not be so modest.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.336
I work in service
of other people,

33:23.420 --> 33:25.588
just outside the spotlight.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.257
Oh, no, no.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.467
I'm still recovering
from dinner.

33:33.346 --> 33:35.598
Outside the spotlight.

33:35.682 --> 33:36.725
This is not right.

33:38.018 --> 33:41.646
You are
the incomparable Judith.

33:43.148 --> 33:44.149
I will fix it.

33:44.232 --> 33:45.942
I'll write a song about you.

33:46.985 --> 33:50.155
No one writes
a song about an editor.

33:50.238 --> 33:52.407
And nothing rhymes
with Judith, Jacques.

33:52.490 --> 33:53.867
Don't waste your time.

34:12.177 --> 34:16.264
Words are what mattered
to Judith

34:18.141 --> 34:22.978
At her desk,
a country house

34:23.063 --> 34:26.608
Sitting beside me

34:26.690 --> 34:31.404
What words do I have
for Judith?

34:33.072 --> 34:36.326
Life is a prize,
summer is sweet

34:36.409 --> 34:39.621
Time is short

34:39.704 --> 34:44.250
Life is what matters
to Judith

34:45.710 --> 34:48.880
Friends are fair,
summer is sweet

34:48.963 --> 34:53.467
Time is short, food is rich

34:56.638 --> 35:01.893
What words do I have
for Judith?

35:04.437 --> 35:07.691
There are really no words

35:09.067 --> 35:15.323
For Judith

35:17.701 --> 35:19.661
Oh.

35:19.744 --> 35:21.371
Look what a mess.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.042
What time
do you leave tomorrow?

35:28.211 --> 35:30.547
Oh, first thing
in the morning.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.757
Oh, my sister.

35:32.841 --> 35:34.300
I love you.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.637
I love you too.

35:37.721 --> 35:38.930
Oh.

35:39.848 --> 35:42.392
Oh, I love you more.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.520
Oh, that's impossible.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.355
I love you more.

35:50.358 --> 35:52.235
Oh, Simca.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.653
I love you.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.238
Oh, Simca.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.906
Oh, no, Julia.

35:56.990 --> 36:00.160
I love you more.
I love you more.

36:00.952 --> 36:02.454
I love you.

36:02.537 --> 36:04.873
Oh, Julia, I love you.

36:11.338 --> 36:12.339
Oh.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.883
I took this shot
when we first arrived.

36:14.966 --> 36:16.176
It's delightful.

36:17.761 --> 36:19.637
Ah, yes.

36:19.721 --> 36:21.765
The impressionists obviously
talked about the light here,

36:21.848 --> 36:26.311
but the way something
as simple as a garden flower

36:26.394 --> 36:29.981
takes on an almost
operatic emotion,

36:30.065 --> 36:32.359
and--and just because
of the time of day you shoot.

36:32.442 --> 36:33.693
Oh.

36:33.777 --> 36:34.819
I love this one.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.321
You do?

36:36.404 --> 36:38.198
On the surface,
it's so picturesque.

36:39.449 --> 36:41.201
But there's a longing there.

36:41.284 --> 36:42.577
Fascinating.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.371
You know,
sometimes the viewer shows

36:44.454 --> 36:46.748
the artist what they've made,

36:46.831 --> 36:48.500
rather than
the other way round.

36:56.007 --> 36:59.386
I--oh, I don't--

37:04.974 --> 37:06.476
Uh, if you'll excuse me.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.271
He's a silly little boy.

37:12.065 --> 37:13.358
Oh.

37:14.567 --> 37:15.985
Tell me a story.

37:17.696 --> 37:20.657
You always tell
the most marvelous stories.

37:20.740 --> 37:23.034
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:23.118 --> 37:24.953
You know, I could--
life you've led,

37:25.036 --> 37:26.913
I could just listen to you
forever.

37:29.374 --> 37:31.209
Hmm.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.461
Did I ever tell you
about the little taverna

37:33.545 --> 37:34.754
I opened on Nantucket?

37:34.838 --> 37:36.256
No. Tell me.

37:37.173 --> 37:39.175
I want to hear it too.

37:39.259 --> 37:40.593
Oh.

37:40.677 --> 37:42.721
No. You wouldn't understand.

37:42.804 --> 37:44.097
You're too young.

37:47.684 --> 37:48.810
Are you ready to go up?

37:49.811 --> 37:52.063
Me? No.

37:52.147 --> 37:53.857
I'm not going up.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.109
You go.

38:08.121 --> 38:10.040
- Bonsoir, madame.
- Bonsoir.

38:10.123 --> 38:11.499
Bonsoir.

38:11.583 --> 38:12.917
Bonsoir, Yvette.

38:14.461 --> 38:15.670
Oh.

38:17.380 --> 38:20.216
That was a meal
for the history books.

38:22.677 --> 38:24.346
Well, I'll see you
in the morning.

38:25.513 --> 38:28.141
I can pick the recipes
on the train for Judith.

38:32.437 --> 38:34.105
Why you?

38:34.189 --> 38:35.148
Because, Simca.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.274
Because?

38:38.193 --> 38:39.778
Well,
because if it wasn't for me,

38:39.861 --> 38:41.905
there wouldn't be
a second book.

38:43.156 --> 38:45.533
Oh, let's not fight.
Let's not do this.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.369
It's our last night.

38:47.452 --> 38:49.996
It is impossible
to work with you.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.331
You cheat.

38:51.414 --> 38:52.999
I cheat?

38:53.083 --> 38:54.292
We didn't even vote.

38:54.376 --> 38:55.418
Exactly.

38:56.628 --> 38:59.172
That was your plan all along.

38:59.297 --> 39:01.508
Because everything for you
is a joke, eh?

39:01.591 --> 39:03.551
You laugh and you joke

39:03.635 --> 39:08.014
and pretend what's underneath
is not underneath.

39:08.098 --> 39:10.517
What in God's name
are you talking about?

39:10.600 --> 39:13.269
Writing with someone
who's not a cook

39:13.353 --> 39:15.563
but a TV personality.

39:23.988 --> 39:25.073
I'm going to bed.

39:27.534 --> 39:28.827
Oh, Julia, wait.

39:28.910 --> 39:31.329
Julia, I didn't mean--

39:34.624 --> 39:36.376
But you did.

39:46.845 --> 39:47.929
You like it?

39:48.013 --> 39:51.141
Oh, I'm gonna keep
playing it in my head forever.

39:51.224 --> 39:52.517
Thank you.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.768
Good night.

39:53.852 --> 39:55.020
I'm just down the hall.

39:55.103 --> 39:56.563
Don't get lost.

39:58.273 --> 40:00.275
I could come back
and visit later.

40:10.952 --> 40:16.458
Jacques, this night
has been intoxicating,

40:16.541 --> 40:17.959
and you are...

40:21.713 --> 40:23.548
But I'm married.

40:24.549 --> 40:27.844
So am I. And I love my wife.

40:29.387 --> 40:30.805
Oh.

40:30.889 --> 40:32.349
Thank you.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.725
I can't.

40:35.560 --> 40:40.231
But boy, oh, boy,
did I have fun tonight.

41:08.885 --> 41:10.053
You all right?

41:11.971 --> 41:13.890
Well, Simca and I had words
in the kitchen.

41:13.973 --> 41:14.974
Ah.

41:15.058 --> 41:17.769
You know, sometimes I think
she really hates me.

41:17.852 --> 41:20.230
She's so jealous.

41:20.313 --> 41:22.107
Success changed everything,

41:22.190 --> 41:24.609
and I don't know
what to do about it.

41:25.860 --> 41:26.903
I understand her.

41:26.986 --> 41:28.029
Oh, you do?

41:28.113 --> 41:31.074
Mm. Can't be easy.

41:31.157 --> 41:32.742
It's easy for me, but...

41:34.619 --> 41:36.913
Imagine
what she must be feeling.

41:39.332 --> 41:42.419
Not like she listens
to anything I say.

41:43.378 --> 41:45.672
Well, she may not listen,
but she hears.

41:47.048 --> 41:48.800
We hardly got anything done.

41:48.883 --> 41:49.884
Mm.

41:52.554 --> 41:55.473
A few days in Paris
will do us some good.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.183
Just the two of us.

41:58.601 --> 42:01.646
And then home.

42:01.730 --> 42:03.106
After all this time away,

42:03.189 --> 42:05.025
it'll be nice
to be back in Boston.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.194
Oh, I think so.

42:08.278 --> 42:11.114
Yes, and our little show,

42:11.197 --> 42:13.783
where I don't have to navigate
our collaboration

42:13.867 --> 42:15.452
like it were a chess game.

42:15.535 --> 42:16.661
Mm.

42:18.246 --> 42:19.831
Oh, that's nice.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.754
And how was
the rest of your night?

42:25.837 --> 42:27.380
Anything interesting happen?

42:28.882 --> 42:29.924
No.

42:31.009 --> 42:32.344
Nothing at all.

43:08.797 --> 43:10.590
Non.

43:23.436 --> 43:25.980
Julia, are you up?

43:27.899 --> 43:29.567
Oh.
Is everything all right, Simca?

43:31.236 --> 43:33.738
I had a dream.
A vision.

43:33.822 --> 43:35.907
What, a "can't wait
until morning" vision?

43:35.990 --> 43:37.826
No, I--

43:37.909 --> 43:41.788
I want to give you a piece
of land, to you and Paul,

43:41.871 --> 43:43.707
on this property.

43:43.790 --> 43:47.293
So you can build a cottage
and come to France

43:47.377 --> 43:50.714
whenever you wish
and have a place of your own.

43:50.797 --> 43:52.549
Oh, Simca.

43:52.632 --> 43:54.551
We're sisters.

43:54.634 --> 43:57.679
And sister needs
to be together.

44:03.601 --> 44:06.229
I like your matching pajamas.

44:07.188 --> 44:08.398
Thank you.

44:09.774 --> 44:10.859
Good night.

44:12.235 --> 44:13.361
See you in the morning.

44:13.445 --> 44:14.946
Okay.

44:21.953 --> 44:24.581
Well, I suppose
that's French aristocrat

44:24.664 --> 44:27.250
for "I'm sorry."

44:28.126 --> 44:29.461
Love is complicated.

44:35.216 --> 44:36.760
What a day.

44:38.678 --> 44:40.221
Mon Dieu.

44:41.514 --> 44:43.391
What a night.
