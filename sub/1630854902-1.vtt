There are others that say

of something new.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.558

12:34.014 --> 12:35.363
He could be
an axe murderer.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.756
Anyone could be
an axe murderer.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.540
Look, just listen
for 10 minutes,

12:38.540 --> 12:41.108

I'll throw him out myself.

amazing in here.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.435

French toast.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.176
Oh, I love
French toast.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.746
Ten minutes, cadets.

13:13.749 --> 13:14.794

13:15.533 --> 13:16.665

13:16.665 --> 13:17.840
What are you
doing here?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.711
We're here

Come on!

13:19.711 --> 13:21.061
How'd you find me?

13:21.061 --> 13:22.758
We tried
three schools.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.064

13:24.151 --> 13:27.371
Uh, these are my friends.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.075
Sir, you can count on it.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.005

14:38.138 --> 14:39.443
I like the sound
of that.

14:41.663 --> 14:44.405
You know, it reminds me
of the words of Jesus.

14:46.450 --> 14:50.541
"To what, then, can I compare
the people of this generation?

14:50.541 --> 14:51.891
"What are they like?"

14:53.501 --> 14:56.852
I was up in San Francisco
for a long time.

14:56.852 --> 15:00.508
Living in Haight-Ashbury,
on the streets, all over.

15:00.508 --> 15:03.859
And we did everything,
and everyone.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.906
But that was the point.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.516
You see,

15:09.212 --> 15:10.387
the drugs,

15:11.519 --> 15:13.129
it's a quest.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.393
For what?

15:17.829 --> 15:18.830
For God.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.225
<i>How can you not see that?</i>

15:23.835 --> 15:28.928
There is an entire generation
right now searching for God.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.321
<i>Everyone
is accepted here.</i>

15:33.845 --> 15:36.718

15:47.207 --> 15:49.687

15:49.687 --> 15:53.691
<i>Just a relentless
pursuit of the truth</i>

15:53.691 --> 15:57.869
<i>by those who have expanded
their consciousness.</i>

15:57.869 --> 16:00.524
Man, we thought acid
was gonna save the world.

16:01.569 --> 16:02.613
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.701
Thanks, Mom.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.313
But that was a lie.

16:06.313 --> 16:09.316
As much of a lie as what
we were rebelling against.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.710
And what brought you
to that realization?

16:14.538 --> 16:17.411
I kept searching
and searching,

16:17.411 --> 16:19.326
and I just finally
got to the end of it.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.893
And there was still a void.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.983
And my people,

16:25.332 --> 16:29.336
well, they're
a desperate bunch.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.816
And "desperation",

16:33.470 --> 16:35.864
man, there is power
in that word.

16:38.823 --> 16:43.785

Chuck Smith, to be desperate?

17:43.975 --> 17:44.976
Yes.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.544
Currently.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.287
I know we must seem
pretty strange.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.378
<i>But if you look
a little deeper,</i>

17:56.814 --> 18:00.253

chasing hard after lies.

18:24.755 --> 18:28.672
And the trouble is,
your people reject them.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.502
So, I ask you, Pastor,

18:34.287 --> 18:37.681

25:57.468 --> 25:59.340
to look like Jesus
or something

26:00.167 --> 26:01.777
and I tell them

26:01.777 --> 26:04.127
I can't think of anybody else
I'd rather look like.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.305
I was reading
in the <i>Book of Acts,</i>

26:08.305 --> 26:10.003
and I think
it kind of explains

26:10.003 --> 26:11.874
what's going on
in Haight-Ashbury.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.268
See, God says,

26:14.268 --> 26:18.315
"I will pour forth my spirit
on all mankind.

26:18.315 --> 26:21.580
"And your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.930
"And your young men
shall see visions.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.410
"And your old men
shall dream dreams.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.325
"I will, in those days,

26:28.325 --> 26:30.240
"pour forth my spirit."

26:32.852 --> 26:36.072
This is what's going on
in San Fran.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.771
And I think it's about
to start happening all over.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.644
Everything's about
to change, folks,

26:42.644 --> 26:44.907
whether you're
ready for it or not.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.910
You can't run from it.
You can't hide from it.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.260
It's coming for you.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.914
It's coming for all of you.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.176
And your children too.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.006
It's exciting, right?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.312
Okay, Chuck.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.445
<i>You wanna grow
the congregation,</i>

27:01.445 --> 27:02.577
<i>I understand that.</i>

27:02.577 --> 27:03.622
But that?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.146
This is not it.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.191
They don't belong here.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.716
Agreed?

27:20.987 --> 27:23.250
Warhol isn't real art.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.599
He just holds up a mirror.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.775
The emptiness, you know,
the materialism

27:26.775 --> 27:29.343
The religion of celebrity.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.779
Dig it, man.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.738
It's like you say everything
that I'm thinking.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.174
It's 'cause cats

27:34.174 --> 27:36.480
like Warhol, you know,
it's what they effectuate.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.004
It's the change

27:38.004 --> 27:41.790
that they cause, and they
inspire for other artists.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.053
See what happens 'cause
without Warhol,

27:44.053 --> 27:47.187
there's no <i>Sergeant Pepper's,</i>

27:47.187 --> 27:49.580
there's no Velvet Underground.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.669
The Doors.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.192
Doors. There's no Doors.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.498
And once art changes,

27:56.500 --> 27:58.633
then everything changes.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.070
I mean, give me a break.
Nothing ever changes

28:01.070 --> 28:02.985
Anyone who tries
just gets shot.

28:02.985 --> 28:06.554
Martin Luther King, and JFK,
and now his brother.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.600
Maybe that's our purpose, guys.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.820
We just overthrow everything.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.343
That's what we do.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.956
You know, we open up a portal
to, like, a whole new...

28:16.956 --> 28:18.740
Uh, like, a whole new...

28:19.436 --> 28:21.351
- Uh...

28:21.351 --> 28:23.702
I can't remember
what I was saying.

28:25.573 --> 28:26.748
What was I saying?

28:29.577 --> 28:31.100
Was I saying something?

28:36.497 --> 28:38.107
Dodie?
Dodie, what's wrong?

28:38.107 --> 28:39.152
Dodie?

28:40.283 --> 28:43.112
Dodie, what's wrong? Dodie?

28:43.112 --> 28:45.462
Dodie, please wake up. Please.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.594
Please, God.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.291
Dodie?

28:48.291 --> 28:50.337
I don't know what to do.
Is there a phone?

28:50.337 --> 28:52.078
Dodie? Dodie?

28:52.078 --> 28:53.862
Turn her over.
Turn her over.

28:53.862 --> 28:54.994
Turn her over on her side.

29:14.404 --> 29:15.405
Okay.

29:16.842 --> 29:17.799
Okay.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.151
So, what did I miss?

29:32.988 --> 29:34.511
Sorry about that.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.904
It was scary.
It's like...

29:38.864 --> 29:40.300
That's your dad?
Yeah, he's...

29:40.300 --> 29:42.476
Chuck,
there's more of them.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.347
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

29:45.696 --> 29:48.177
I guess I'm just gonna
have to ask them to leave.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.440
Sounds great.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.051
2

29:52.791 --> 29:53.879
Excuse me.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.445
- Who are you?
- Hi, Chuck.

29:55.445 --> 29:58.231
That's Ron. This is Mickie.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.015
That's Lynette at the table.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.843
Hey, Ron.
- New brothers and sisters.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.627
Hope it's okay
they stay here too.

30:03.627 --> 30:04.846
Isn't it great, Dad?

30:04.846 --> 30:06.717
No. It's not.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.197
- Oh.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.156
And I'm Connie.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.940
Yes. My wife, Connie.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.159
You're married?

30:13.159 --> 30:14.856
Wow,
you're a real pastor, huh?

30:14.856 --> 30:17.337
That's a trip. We're gonna have
some questions for you, mister.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.904
Maybe later. Yeah.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.734
Are they camping
in my yard?

30:23.734 --> 30:25.345
Oh, it's okay,
don't worry about them.

30:25.345 --> 30:26.781
They're used to it.
They don't mind.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.696
Wait till you see
who's in here.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.440
What have you
done to my home?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.181
What are these people
doing here?

30:35.181 --> 30:37.226
Met them at a coffee shop
in Newport.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.793
Hey, man. Nice house.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.970
What are they doing in my house?

30:43.015 --> 30:44.233
'Cause I had this idea.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.323
If you wanna reach my people,

30:47.323 --> 30:50.761
you need to speak to them
in a language they understand.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.981
If I bring them
into my church,

30:52.981 --> 30:54.243
I'm gonna lose my job.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.724
Just listen, huh?
Sit here.

30:56.724 --> 30:59.031
Hey, guys. Can we just
give him a taste?

30:59.031 --> 31:00.728
Two, three, four.

31:11.521 --> 31:16.439

33:07.855 --> 33:10.162
Man, it's so crazy
being in a church.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.859
I've never been
in a church before.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.904
- I don't think any of us have.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.297
We call ourselves Love Song

33:15.297 --> 33:19.084
because, well, we sing songs
about love.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.911
Real love. You dig it?

33:20.911 --> 33:22.870
- One way, man.

33:25.481 --> 33:28.006
Now, we're gonna be back here
next Sunday as well

33:28.745 --> 33:30.356
except for Tommy.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.488
He's, uh, gotta serve out
the rest of his drug sentence.

33:32.488 --> 33:33.837
That happens.

33:33.837 --> 33:35.535
But he only has
three more months.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.537
- So, praise the Lord.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.627
Gosh.

33:40.627 --> 33:43.412
And thank you to Pastor Chuck
for having us come through.

33:43.412 --> 33:46.024
Thank you, fellas.
It sounds great.

33:49.853 --> 33:50.854
This is truth.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.943
This is life.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.206
This is God's word.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.258
Let's open it together.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.262
<i>What light
through yonder window breaks?</i>

34:07.262 --> 34:10.048
<i>Art thou not Romeo
and a Montague?</i>

34:10.048 --> 34:12.746
<i>Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.</i>

34:12.746 --> 34:14.704
I can feel the words, man.

34:14.704 --> 34:17.403
<i>With love's light wings
did I o'er-perch these walls.</i>

34:17.403 --> 34:18.839
Like, inside.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.710
<i>For stony limits cannot
hold love out.</i>

34:20.710 --> 34:24.149
<i>And what love can do
that dares love attempt.</i>

34:24.149 --> 34:25.411
<i>Therefore thy kinsmen</i>

34:25.411 --> 34:26.977
<i>- are no stop to me.
- Shh!</i>

34:28.849 --> 34:30.285
I finally see.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.113
<i>Oh, gentle Romeo,</i>

34:33.332 --> 34:34.507
<i>if thou dost love,</i>

34:35.334 --> 34:37.292
<i>pronounce it faithfully.</i>

34:54.483 --> 34:56.094
Cathe!

34:56.094 --> 34:57.312
- Hi.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.487
There you are!

34:58.487 --> 34:59.532
What are you doing?

35:00.576 --> 35:01.969
I have to tell...

35:01.969 --> 35:03.753
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.407
He's coming
over here, isn't he?

35:05.407 --> 35:07.627
- I can't do this right now.
- I'm sorry.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.019
Hi. Cathe.

35:09.019 --> 35:10.412
- Cathe. Cathe.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.459
- Cathe. Cathe. Wait.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.677
What is your problem?

35:14.677 --> 35:16.157
- What is my problem?
- Yeah.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.640
My sister
almost died, Greg.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.164
That's my problem.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.471
It's what I'm seeing.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.038
So, no.

35:28.038 --> 35:31.041
No, I don't wanna go with you
on your little trip.

35:49.451 --> 35:50.713
Hey.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.498
Get in. It's gonna be fun.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.285
<i>Mom,
where are we going?</i>

35:57.285 --> 35:59.069
<i>Sunny California.</i>

35:59.069 --> 36:02.203
<i>Warm weather, beaches.
You're gonna love it.</i>

36:02.203 --> 36:04.423
<i>But what about Dad?</i>

36:04.423 --> 36:06.338
Mom, we have to wait for him.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.647
He's not coming back, Greg.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.477
It's what people do.
They leave.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.741
<i>So we're moving on.</i>

36:26.575 --> 36:28.751
Oh, no. Come on, Gerger.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.580
Help me out here.

36:31.580 --> 36:32.886
Hey. Hey.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.414
That's the spirit.

36:53.646 --> 36:56.344
<i>These kids are
runaways, most of them.</i>

36:56.344 --> 36:59.782
They got drug addictions,
medical issues.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.001
And they need our help.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.045
Yeah, but, Chuck...

37:03.395 --> 37:05.005
I mean, they need to go home.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.355
They're making our
congregation uncomfortable.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.097
Well, maybe they should
be uncomfortable.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.142
Maybe we all should.

37:12.142 --> 37:16.408
Maybe it's my job
to make us uncomfortable.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.757
And I haven't been
doing it.

37:17.757 --> 37:18.975
Chuck, stop.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.020
This is enough.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.544
This is a house
of worship.

37:22.544 --> 37:24.764
And, yes, we expect
a certain level of dignity here.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.418
These girls are wearing
halter tops,

37:26.418 --> 37:28.071
and half of them aren't
even wearing shoes.

37:28.071 --> 37:30.987
They're staining the new shag
carpet with their bare feet.

37:32.554 --> 37:33.512
The carpet?

37:33.816 --> 37:35.122
Mmm.

37:35.122 --> 37:38.212
Oh. Yeah, let's be sure
to save the carpet.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.996
You keep this up,
and you're gonna drive away

37:39.996 --> 37:42.738
the only contributing members
that we've got.

37:42.738 --> 37:43.739
You hearing me now?

37:45.045 --> 37:46.046
Loud and clear.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.268
<i>Unlike the individual,</i>

37:50.268 --> 37:52.270
<i>they seize it by one act
of violence.</i>

37:52.270 --> 37:53.358
So many voices.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.360
It's hard to hear the truth.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.101
Truth is always quiet.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.147
It's the lies
that are loud.

38:02.671 --> 38:03.759
It's complicated.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.851
The truth is simple.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.215
What is going on?

38:33.789 --> 38:36.183
You can put that
right over there on that towel.

38:36.183 --> 38:38.011
Give me this other one here.
There we go.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.492
I baptize these feet
in the name

38:40.492 --> 38:41.667
of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.

38:41.667 --> 38:42.885
There you go.
Welcome to church.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.147
Thank you.

38:44.147 --> 38:46.715
Hello, you. Let's have
that foot, please.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.718
This is terrific.
There we go.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.459
Okay.

38:51.459 --> 38:54.201
Place them both on that towel,
and then step on into church.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.159
- Welcome.
Thank you.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.639
Hello, young lady.
How are you?

38:57.639 --> 38:59.380
Good.
- Let's have that foot.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.479
Let's have that other foot.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.267
Why don't you go sit
next to that fella

39:17.267 --> 39:18.878
- in the cantaloupe jacket.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.314
Good to see you.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.533
Thank you.
- Enjoy. Welcome to church.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.578
Thank you.
- Hello, young lady.

39:23.578 --> 39:25.624
<i>Well, last year, I had
the privilege of visiting,</i>

39:25.624 --> 39:26.973
uh, New York City.

39:28.714 --> 39:29.932
And like any other tourist,

39:29.932 --> 39:32.718
I paid a visit
to the Statue of Liberty,

39:32.718 --> 39:33.936
and I read those famous words.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.113
"Give me your tired,
your poor,

39:37.984 --> 39:39.246
"your huddled masses,

39:40.595 --> 39:42.031
"yearning to breathe free."

39:43.685 --> 39:46.079
And as I read those words,
I thought, well, that's

39:47.907 --> 39:50.823
Christianity, isn't it?

39:50.823 --> 39:53.347
I mean, it's the essence of it.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.959
An invitation to the broken.

39:58.744 --> 40:02.225
Jesus was very friendly
with the outcasts.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.749
In Revelation 22, it says,

40:05.620 --> 40:08.275
"Let the one who can hear say,
'Come.'

40:08.275 --> 40:10.103
"Let the one who is thirsty come.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.584
"Let the one who desires

40:14.412 --> 40:17.284
"take the waters
of life freely."

40:20.418 --> 40:21.897
I want you all to look at me. Uh...

40:22.768 --> 40:23.769
Please.

40:24.987 --> 40:25.988
Every one of you.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.258
This place,

40:39.872 --> 40:41.351
it is yours.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.444
I don't...

40:46.444 --> 40:49.534
I don't care if anybody else
thinks so.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.927
If... if you feel
like you're an outcast...

40:51.927 --> 40:54.843
then join us here.

40:55.627 --> 40:56.889
If you feel like

40:58.281 --> 41:00.675
you're misunderstood
and judged,

41:00.675 --> 41:02.285
this is where you belong.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.636
If you feel ashamed or trapped

41:06.072 --> 41:08.117
in something you've done
or are doing,

41:11.817 --> 41:12.905
you will find

41:14.602 --> 41:17.387
forgiveness and freedom...

41:20.434 --> 41:21.435
right here.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.006
No guilt trips.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.053
This is your home.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.754
And I want you to tell
all your friends about it.

41:35.754 --> 41:36.798
There is a place for you.

41:38.670 --> 41:42.543
Now that door is open
all the time for you.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.589
Any time of day.

41:44.589 --> 41:47.287
And if there are some
who don't like that,

41:47.287 --> 41:50.595
well, then, that door
is open for you too.

41:52.727 --> 41:53.859
It works both ways.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.506
All right, Pastor.
Let's begin.

42:32.506 --> 42:33.551
- Let's begin.

42:34.639 --> 42:35.596
Hey, Chuck.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.165
You're gonna need
a bigger church.

43:18.726 --> 43:20.598
Hey, Charlie, slow down, man.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.816
Relax, man.

43:24.645 --> 43:27.256
Charlie, hey, man.
Hey, stop swerving, man.

43:30.259 --> 43:31.957
Charlie, slow down, man.
Slow down.

43:31.957 --> 43:33.132
- Slow down!

43:34.263 --> 43:36.614
Hey. Charlie. Charlie, man.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.529
Steer right, man!
Steer right! Steer right!

43:43.098 --> 43:45.797
- Get off the wheel, man!
No, no.

43:48.016 --> 43:49.801
Hey, man.

43:49.801 --> 43:51.237
We're gonna die.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.025
Slow down, man! Slow down!

43:57.025 --> 43:59.158
Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down!

44:07.993 --> 44:09.603
You all right
back there, man?

44:12.127 --> 44:14.347
Get me out of here!

44:25.793 --> 44:27.621
Get out
of the road, man!

44:53.603 --> 44:56.084
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

44:56.084 --> 44:58.304
I don't wanna die.

44:58.304 --> 45:00.785
Hey. Hey. All right.
Hey, hey, hey.

45:03.570 --> 45:04.919
It's all right, brother.

45:04.919 --> 45:06.704
I'm dying. I'm gonna die.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.662
That's the drugs
lying to you, man.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.099
You're alive. I promise you.

45:13.275 --> 45:14.668
What's your name?

45:16.975 --> 45:19.107
Greg. Greg.

45:19.107 --> 45:20.630
It's all right.
It's all right.

45:20.630 --> 45:22.502
I'm Lonnie.

45:22.502 --> 45:24.547
You ran past
my house screaming.

45:25.244 --> 45:26.767
And I just followed you.

45:26.767 --> 45:27.768
Just breathe.

45:29.291 --> 45:31.206
Lonnie, be honest with me, man.
Are you really here?

45:31.206 --> 45:32.207
Are you really here?

45:33.034 --> 45:35.254
Yeah, man, I'm really here.

45:35.254 --> 45:36.777
And I'm gonna sit
with you here

45:36.777 --> 45:38.126
as long as it takes, okay?

45:39.693 --> 45:42.478
What are you doing out here?
What are you running from?

45:44.524 --> 45:45.655
I don't know.

45:50.573 --> 45:52.532
Hey. Where are you going?

45:56.275 --> 45:57.276
Hey, Greg.

46:00.105 --> 46:02.063
God says you don't
have to run anymore.

46:19.646 --> 46:20.690
What's up, man?

46:23.041 --> 46:25.391
Last night was crazy,
wasn't it? A little bit.

46:25.391 --> 46:26.871
Ah, yeah,
we could've died.

46:26.871 --> 46:28.133
Nah, come on, man.

46:28.133 --> 46:30.439
We're going to live
forever, Greggo.

46:30.439 --> 46:31.614
That's the thing, man.

46:31.614 --> 46:32.659
Dexter!

46:33.791 --> 46:35.053
You have some
weed of mine.

46:36.228 --> 46:37.925
<i>Man, slave owners,
you know,</i>

46:37.925 --> 46:41.842
<i>they were pushing religion
onto the slaves that they owned</i>

46:41.842 --> 46:45.541
<i>whose blood and features
that I bear.</i>

46:45.541 --> 46:47.152
<i>- Christianity supports...</i>
- I'm Greg Laurie.

46:47.152 --> 46:48.588
<i>...property owners
in the city.</i>

46:48.588 --> 46:49.807
<i>The police, military...</i>

46:49.807 --> 46:51.243
Oh. Yeah, right,
I think I remember you.

46:51.243 --> 46:52.331
- Oh, you do remember?
- Yeah.

46:52.331 --> 46:53.985
Oh, nice.

46:53.985 --> 46:55.247
Does that mean you're done
ignoring me?

46:56.335 --> 46:57.684
I don't know.

46:57.684 --> 46:59.033
<i>And it's just never
been any good.</i>

46:59.033 --> 47:00.730
I've just been figuring
some stuff out.

47:00.730 --> 47:02.123
<i>No religion's
really good, really.</i>

47:02.123 --> 47:03.472
Yeah.

47:03.472 --> 47:04.822
<i>- You just gotta dig people...</i>
- You okay?

47:06.606 --> 47:09.043
- Yeah. Just, uh...
<i>...and dig each other.</i>

47:09.043 --> 47:10.740
...figuring some stuff out.

47:10.740 --> 47:13.352
<i>Now I think the, uh,
Satan people wanna talk.</i>

47:20.750 --> 47:21.751
<i>Hail Satan.</i>

47:24.972 --> 47:28.846
So, this is very creepy,
and we should leave, right?

47:28.846 --> 47:31.544
- Before he starts
sacrificing us.

47:31.544 --> 47:33.546
I'm... I'm waiting to hear
someone talk.

47:34.982 --> 47:36.897
That guy,
sitting right over there.

47:36.897 --> 47:38.768
Oh, I see.

47:38.768 --> 47:41.336
The Jesus guy.

47:41.336 --> 47:43.686
- Huh. This is a tragedy.

47:43.686 --> 47:45.297
- This is very sad...
Thanks, man.

47:45.297 --> 47:46.864
...for me to hear right now,
okay? We're losing our girl

47:46.864 --> 47:48.300
to the dark side,
and you're not even...

47:48.300 --> 47:49.475
What are you looking at?

47:49.475 --> 47:51.651
<i>That was really far out.</i>

47:51.651 --> 47:53.914
The Magic Bus is leaving
in seven minutes, folks.

47:53.914 --> 47:55.220
<i>I'm really glad to be here.</i>

47:56.090 --> 47:57.396
<i>Really, all I got to bring</i>

47:57.396 --> 48:01.226
<i>is what the Bible calls
the good news.</i>

48:01.226 --> 48:04.533
So, this is what you've been
trying to figure out?

48:04.533 --> 48:06.231
<i>In the Gospel
of Matthew...</i>

48:06.231 --> 48:08.363
- Yeah. Mostly.
<i>...Jesus said,</i>

48:08.363 --> 48:10.409
<i>"Come unto me
all ye that labor.</i>

48:10.409 --> 48:13.412
- There's this, um, church.
<i>"...and are heavy laden...</i>

48:13.412 --> 48:15.022
It's called

48:15.022 --> 48:15.936
- Calvary Chapel.
<i>"...and I will
give you rest.</i>

48:15.936 --> 48:17.590
<i>"Take my yoke upon you...</i>

48:17.590 --> 48:19.070
You could come.

48:19.070 --> 48:20.593
<i>"...and learn from me,
for I am meek...</i>

48:20.593 --> 48:21.855
Why not?

48:21.855 --> 48:23.030
<i>"...and lowly
in heart...</i>

48:23.030 --> 48:24.640
We say we're looking for truth.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.164
What if this is true?

48:26.164 --> 48:27.948
<i>"Ye shall find rest
unto your souls."</i>

48:27.948 --> 48:29.602
'Cause everything
that we've been trying...

48:29.602 --> 48:31.125
<i>There's a lot of heavy
stuff happening right now.</i>

48:31.125 --> 48:33.693
...it's not working for me.

48:33.693 --> 48:35.434
<i>Jesus wants you know...</i>
And this...

48:35.434 --> 48:37.131
<i>...you don't have
to deal with it on your own.</i>

48:37.131 --> 48:39.655
I don't know.
It's something I haven't
heard before.

48:40.874 --> 48:42.006
It's different.

48:42.006 --> 48:44.356
<i>Let him take
it from you.</i>

48:44.356 --> 48:46.271
<i>- Let him help you.</i>
- Come on.

48:50.536 --> 48:52.146
<i>Jesus also said,</i>

48:53.800 --> 48:55.845
<i>"Whoever is not with me</i>

48:57.021 --> 48:58.936
<i>"is against me.</i>

48:58.936 --> 49:02.113
<i>"And whoever does not
gather with me scatters."</i>

49:02.809 --> 49:04.071
<i>You have to decide</i>

49:08.249 --> 49:09.381
<i>for yourself.</i>

49:12.775 --> 49:14.473
<i>We all have to decide.</i>

49:22.568 --> 49:25.266
<i>♪ These are common
words but true</i>

49:29.140 --> 49:31.403
<i>♪ We aren't quite a mountain</i>

49:33.796 --> 49:36.147
<i>♪ But he's moved us here</i>

49:36.147 --> 49:37.365
<i>♪ To you</i>

49:41.108 --> 49:45.460
<i>♪ Accept him
with your whole heart</i>

49:46.113 --> 49:47.419
Welcome home.

49:47.419 --> 49:49.899
<i>♪ And use your own two hands</i>

49:49.899 --> 49:50.944
Right over there.

49:53.686 --> 49:56.906
<i>♪ With one reach out to Jesus</i>

49:58.082 --> 49:59.953
<i>♪ And with the other</i>

50:03.870 --> 50:05.654
<i>♪ Bring a friend ♪</i>

50:17.492 --> 50:20.104
Thanks, guys.
That was beautiful.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.851
Jesus Christ willingly

50:29.896 --> 50:31.289
went to the cross,

50:34.248 --> 50:35.423
and he died.

50:36.598 --> 50:37.773
He gave his life.

50:39.079 --> 50:42.865
He became a sacrifice
for all of us here

50:42.865 --> 50:46.782
so that we might be
forgiven of our sins.

50:46.782 --> 50:48.741
That we might be reborn

50:49.481 --> 50:50.569
of water

50:52.223 --> 50:53.180
and the Spirit.

50:54.573 --> 50:55.878
- That's why we're going down...

50:55.878 --> 50:57.184
...to the ocean this weekend.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.798
So many of you
wanna be baptized.

51:04.148 --> 51:06.150
And, well, you look around,

51:06.150 --> 51:07.803
we don't have any more room.

51:07.803 --> 51:10.284
This place is packed
even on a Monday night.

51:15.898 --> 51:17.683
So we're going down
to the beach,

51:17.683 --> 51:20.425
Saturday afternoon
at Pirate's Cove.

51:21.339 --> 51:22.992
Maybe I'll wear my eye patch.

51:22.992 --> 51:24.472
- Arr!

51:27.127 --> 51:29.129
Let's all turn our Bibles now.

51:30.565 --> 51:31.914
John, chapter three.

51:31.914 --> 51:33.133
I need help!

51:35.788 --> 51:37.006
I'm gonna die.

51:38.182 --> 51:40.967
I can't stop. I need help.

51:40.967 --> 51:43.752
No, you're all right, brother.
You're all right. It's okay.

51:43.752 --> 51:45.276
- You're all right.

51:46.451 --> 51:48.366
You're safe here.

51:48.366 --> 51:50.063
You're not gonna die.

51:50.716 --> 51:52.021
Not on my watch.

51:53.545 --> 51:54.981
There is hope
for you here.

52:00.073 --> 52:02.641
Let's all pray for him. Guys,
come on. Help me pray for him.

52:12.216 --> 52:13.521
Heavenly Father,
we thank you

52:13.521 --> 52:15.523
for all your loving
and gracious gifts

52:15.523 --> 52:18.918
from your Spirit that you send
down upon this man right now

52:18.918 --> 52:21.050
to be healed in Jesus' name.

52:21.050 --> 52:22.400
We thank you, Lord.

52:27.448 --> 52:29.363
In the name
of Jesus Christ...

52:55.172 --> 52:56.608
Will you just give
this a chance?

52:56.608 --> 52:58.175
I don't know,
I think it might be real.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.654
That's the problem, Cathe.

53:01.221 --> 53:02.527
Look, I can't...

53:02.527 --> 53:04.268
I just can't be
let down again.

53:06.574 --> 53:08.097
What I felt in there, I
haven't...

53:08.576 --> 53:09.577
I know.

53:11.013 --> 53:13.102
What if it's another high?

53:13.102 --> 53:15.409
What if it's just
another drug, you know?

53:15.409 --> 53:17.063
It's good for a minute,
and then it's gone.

53:17.063 --> 53:18.107
What then?

53:20.414 --> 53:21.720
We can find out together.

53:47.963 --> 53:49.487
- Come on.
- It's just water.

53:49.487 --> 53:51.140
I'm just saying,
what is it gonna prove?

53:51.140 --> 53:52.925
You're right, it's just water.
So why are you freaking out?

53:52.925 --> 53:54.753
I'm not freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.

54:00.976 --> 54:02.978
Okay, I'm freaking out
a little bit.

54:02.978 --> 54:04.241
You're gonna be fine.

54:10.464 --> 54:11.857
Do you fully accept
Jesus Christ

54:11.857 --> 54:13.162
as your Lord and Savior?

54:13.162 --> 54:14.729
Yes, I do.
- Then I baptize you,

54:14.729 --> 54:17.558
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

54:21.997 --> 54:23.521
Today you are transformed.

54:27.220 --> 54:29.701
Your heart, your soul, your life
will never be the same.

54:29.701 --> 54:31.137
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:34.445 --> 54:36.055
How did that feel?
- You'll see.

54:41.756 --> 54:42.757
Hi.

54:44.019 --> 54:45.238
Greg, right?

54:45.238 --> 54:46.370
Yeah.

54:47.458 --> 54:48.894
I have been praying
for this moment

54:48.894 --> 54:50.417
since I met first you.

54:50.417 --> 54:51.853
Have you decided?

54:51.853 --> 54:54.291
Um, I... I don't know.

54:55.727 --> 54:57.337
You wanna decide right now?

54:59.687 --> 55:01.907
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

55:01.907 --> 55:02.951
Then pray with me.

55:05.258 --> 55:06.303
Lord Jesus,

55:07.913 --> 55:09.828
I know I'm a sinner.

55:09.828 --> 55:11.308
Lord Jesus,
I know I'm a sinner.

55:11.308 --> 55:12.961
You are the Savior
of the world.

55:12.961 --> 55:14.702
You are the Savior
of the world.

55:14.702 --> 55:16.313
I ask you
to come into my life.

55:16.313 --> 55:17.923
I ask you to come into my life.

55:17.923 --> 55:19.098
I repent for my sins.

55:19.098 --> 55:20.795
I repent for all my sins.

55:20.795 --> 55:23.798
And I accept you as my Lord
and Savior, my God, and friend.

55:23.798 --> 55:26.627
And I accept you as my Lord and
Savior, my God, and my friend.

55:26.627 --> 55:27.846
In Jesus' name...

55:27.846 --> 55:29.500
- In Jesus' name...
- Amen.

55:31.937 --> 55:35.462
Greg, I baptize you

55:35.462 --> 55:38.465
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

55:38.465 --> 55:39.814
and of the Holy Spirit.

55:40.380 --> 55:41.338
Amen.

56:38.133 --> 56:39.613
How do you feel?

56:39.613 --> 56:40.658
Alive.

56:42.007 --> 56:43.312
Oh, my God.

56:45.750 --> 56:46.707
Thank you.

58:00.215 --> 58:01.390
Yeah,
so this guy is moving

58:01.390 --> 58:02.914
into the trailer
with my mom,

58:02.914 --> 58:05.482
and I have
nowhere else to go.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.744
So, you sure
it's okay I'm here?

58:06.744 --> 58:08.528
Oh. Yeah, brother.
There's plenty of room.

58:09.529 --> 58:11.052
Where did you
get this place?

58:11.052 --> 58:12.227
Kay found it,

58:12.227 --> 58:14.621
- and Chuck rented it for us.
- Ah.

58:14.621 --> 58:17.929
It's condemned, technically,
so it doesn't cost much.

58:17.929 --> 58:20.148
I think, mainly, they wanted us
out of their home.

58:20.758 --> 58:21.759
Which I get.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.805
Welcome to paradise, brother.

58:27.460 --> 58:30.419
This is Lance. He used to work
for a big marketing firm.

58:30.419 --> 58:31.769
Greg draws too.

58:31.769 --> 58:35.207
That's Bud, Marty,
Steven, and Suzie.

58:35.207 --> 58:37.035
They're a bunch
of righteous cats.

58:37.035 --> 58:39.559
Lot of artists here.
You'll fit right in, brother.

58:39.559 --> 58:41.518
And Janette, Chuck's daughter.

58:41.518 --> 58:42.910
Greg, finally!

58:43.824 --> 58:45.043
And my wife, Connie.

58:45.043 --> 58:46.305
Praise God.

58:46.305 --> 58:48.263
I have heard
so much about you.

58:48.263 --> 58:49.743
- Okay.
Come on in.

58:49.743 --> 58:51.440
- Make yourself at home.
Okay. That's great.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.399
Let's just give him
a little space, Connie, okay?

58:53.399 --> 58:54.792
I'm just
greeting him, Lonnie.

58:54.792 --> 58:56.315
You're overwhelming
him, Connie.

58:56.315 --> 58:57.664
I'm okay.

58:57.664 --> 58:59.623
Don't mind him.
He gets irritable.

58:59.623 --> 59:00.972
Connie!

59:00.972 --> 59:02.539
See? Irritable.

59:04.932 --> 59:06.020
Come on up here, Greg.

59:10.590 --> 59:12.461
Voila! Your own room.

59:16.727 --> 59:18.990
Uh, that's not human blood.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.080
We had raccoons.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.169
They're tough little critters.

59:24.169 --> 59:25.344
Don't mind the smell.

59:25.344 --> 59:27.476
Yeah, that will be gone
in about a week.

59:29.522 --> 59:30.654
It's perfect.

59:31.437 --> 59:34.179
They're just people, Kay.

59:34.179 --> 59:36.573
Crazy, weirdo, homeless,
drug people.

59:36.573 --> 59:39.140
But, yes, just people.

59:42.491 --> 59:43.797
- Hello.
- How are you?

59:46.321 --> 59:47.322
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Hey.
- I can't believe

59:47.322 --> 59:48.541
you're actually doing this.

59:48.541 --> 59:50.238
Me either.

59:50.238 --> 59:52.893
<i>In your name. Amen.</i>

59:52.893 --> 59:55.156
Amen.
- All right. Dig in.

1:00:01.728 --> 1:00:03.600
Hey. You doing all right?

1:00:05.079 --> 1:00:06.037
Yeah, just...

1:00:06.951 --> 1:00:08.430
adjusting.

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:11.303
Relax. You're home now.

it's everything
I've been looking for.

1:01:01.570 --> 1:01:04.661
I'm really glad that
we're in this together, but...

1:01:05.357 --> 1:01:06.967
But what?

1:01:06.967 --> 1:01:08.403
But I feel like
if we're gonna do this,

1:01:08.403 --> 1:01:10.362
then I wanna do it right.

1:01:10.362 --> 1:01:12.407
So I just wanted
to tell you that

1:01:13.974 --> 1:01:15.497
if you ever get between
me and God,

1:01:15.497 --> 1:01:16.673
then it's over for us.

1:01:21.112 --> 1:01:22.679
That sounded
better in my head.

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:24.376
Yeah, it was a little harsh.

1:01:26.770 --> 1:01:28.728
Are you finally
officially asking me out?

1:01:30.077 --> 1:01:33.515
What would you
say if I were?

1:01:34.865 --> 1:01:35.909
I don't know.

1:01:36.518 --> 1:01:37.519
Ask me again.

1:01:39.478 --> 1:01:40.697
Hey, Greg.

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:42.742
<i>We have a surprise for you.</i>

1:01:42.742 --> 1:01:43.830
<i>Come outside.</i>

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:45.397
Really?

1:01:47.007 --> 1:01:49.401
We all pitched in,
and we got you a car.

1:01:49.401 --> 1:01:50.489
So you don't have
to pick up your girlfriend

1:01:50.489 --> 1:01:52.099
on a bicycle anymore.

1:01:52.099 --> 1:01:53.100
Huh?

1:01:54.188 --> 1:01:56.190
She's all yours, brother.

1:01:56.190 --> 1:01:58.062
- This is my car?

1:01:58.062 --> 1:01:59.237
She is yours.

1:01:59.933 --> 1:02:01.718
This is my car?

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.545
- Think he likes it.
- I do too.

1:02:03.545 --> 1:02:04.633
Does it run?

1:02:04.633 --> 1:02:05.809
Of course, it runs.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:07.332
We all prayed over it
this morning.

1:02:07.332 --> 1:02:08.420
I'm gonna fire it up.

1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:09.421
Get in there.
- Yeah.

1:02:10.074 --> 1:02:11.249
Give it a whirl.

1:02:15.209 --> 1:02:16.210
Okay.

1:02:18.343 --> 1:02:19.648
Come on, Lord.

1:02:30.398 --> 1:02:32.270
It's just a warm-up.

1:02:35.316 --> 1:02:36.622
Let's pray over it again, guys.

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:40.104
Heavenly Father,

1:02:40.104 --> 1:02:42.671
we just thank you for sending
down your Holy Spirit

1:02:42.671 --> 1:02:44.978
- into this car, especially...

1:02:44.978 --> 1:02:47.154
...engine and the carburetor

1:02:47.154 --> 1:02:49.766
that I was assured
was just replaced.

1:02:49.766 --> 1:02:51.028
- Thank You, Lord.

1:02:51.028 --> 1:02:52.681
Thank You. In Jesus' name...

1:02:52.681 --> 1:02:54.596
- Amen.
Amen.

1:02:56.511 --> 1:02:58.426
Lord,
we're asking you here, please.

1:02:58.426 --> 1:03:00.864
I'm looking bad right now,
Lord. Please.

1:03:00.864 --> 1:03:04.084
Just give us a little bit
of Spirit juice here.

1:03:05.216 --> 1:03:06.826
Yeah!

1:03:08.045 --> 1:03:11.004
- Yes!

1:03:11.004 --> 1:03:12.571
Thank you
so much, guys.

1:03:13.224 --> 1:03:14.442
I knew it would run.

Of course,
that would happen.

1:03:39.076 --> 1:03:40.817
Is that your car?

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:41.948
It's a piece of junk.

1:03:41.948 --> 1:03:43.210
It's amazing.

1:03:43.210 --> 1:03:44.821
It's amazing, Greg.

1:03:44.821 --> 1:03:46.431
We have a car. Bye, Daddy.

1:03:46.431 --> 1:03:48.607
We have a car!
He has a car.

1:03:50.696 --> 1:03:52.089
What a gentleman.

1:03:53.090 --> 1:03:54.047
Thank you.

1:03:54.918 --> 1:03:55.962
Sorry. One minute.

1:03:58.225 --> 1:03:59.400
It's kind of stuck.

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:00.967
This is great.

1:04:03.230 --> 1:04:04.188
Wait, one second.

1:04:05.276 --> 1:04:06.277
Okay.

1:04:20.117 --> 1:04:22.771
So, what do you wanna
do after high school?

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:24.861
I don't know.

1:04:27.994 --> 1:04:29.517
I just don't want this to end.

1:04:31.824 --> 1:04:33.652
Do you ever worry
about that sometimes?

1:04:37.786 --> 1:04:38.787
No.

1:04:40.702 --> 1:04:42.182
It's not going anywhere.

1:04:44.793 --> 1:04:46.056
And neither am I.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:07.381
<i>What happened next?</i>

1:05:07.381 --> 1:05:10.645
Um, the sea raged.
They threw him overboard.

1:05:10.645 --> 1:05:12.691
The raging stopped.
And then...

1:05:12.691 --> 1:05:14.649
Whoa. "Raging stopped."

1:05:14.649 --> 1:05:17.304
I like that.
I'm gonna use that.

1:05:18.392 --> 1:05:19.785
Hey.

1:05:19.785 --> 1:05:22.135
Could you use your
camera to film me?

1:05:22.135 --> 1:05:23.441
- Like, your sermon?
- Yeah.

1:05:23.441 --> 1:05:24.529
Yeah, sure.

1:05:24.529 --> 1:05:25.617
Right on.

1:05:27.358 --> 1:05:28.968
I'm working!

1:05:28.968 --> 1:05:30.883
Other people
live here too, you know.

1:05:39.239 --> 1:05:40.501
<i>So, you're clean?</i>

1:05:40.501 --> 1:05:42.199
No cravings at all?

1:05:42.199 --> 1:05:44.636
Yeah, man.
I'm completely delivered.

1:05:44.636 --> 1:05:46.551
But how did that happen?

1:05:46.551 --> 1:05:47.944
Man, I just told you.

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:49.380
But that makes no sense.

1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:50.990
I know!

1:05:50.990 --> 1:05:52.949
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1:05:59.912 --> 1:06:01.783
<i>You know, we were runnin' out
of space, so we thought,</i>

1:06:01.783 --> 1:06:03.307
<i>"Let's put up this tent</i>

1:06:03.307 --> 1:06:05.483
<i>"and maybe in a couple of
months, we'd fill it."</i>

1:06:05.483 --> 1:06:08.486
And it's full in one day!

1:06:11.532 --> 1:06:12.794
<i>Lonnie's gonna preach.</i>

1:06:22.456 --> 1:06:23.588
Thank you, Chuck.

1:06:27.244 --> 1:06:30.725
<i>So, to bring it all
full circle back to Jonah,</i>

1:06:32.336 --> 1:06:34.947
<i>are the storms

1:06:36.688 --> 1:06:37.994
<i>Do the drugs</i>

<i>no longer quiet

<i>When Jonah stopped running
from God, the raging stopped.</i>

1:06:49.266 --> 1:06:51.833
That's my line.
He used my line.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:53.139
<i>I turned to God.</i>

1:06:54.619 --> 1:06:56.055
<i>Stopped running.</i>

1:06:56.055 --> 1:06:57.839
<i>And when you do,</i>

1:06:57.839 --> 1:07:00.842
<i>the raging in your life

1:07:02.366 --> 1:07:03.715
<i>...stop.</i>

1:07:03.715 --> 1:07:05.021
<i>Like it did in mine.</i>

1:07:08.328 --> 1:07:10.896
<i>Of course, you might have

<i>Someone here is in pain.</i>

1:07:50.805 --> 1:07:52.590
<i>I see you.</i>

1:07:59.858 --> 1:08:02.078
You've suffered a long time,
haven't you?

1:08:03.992 --> 1:08:05.124
Is it drugs?

1:08:07.039 --> 1:08:08.301
Yes.

1:08:12.349 --> 1:08:14.873
And you've tried
so many times to stop,

1:08:16.266 --> 1:08:18.094
but it has its
grip on you.

1:08:18.964 --> 1:08:20.270
Yes.

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.701

call me that anymore?

1:18:26.702 --> 1:18:28.138
<i>Did you see it?</i>

1:18:30.009 --> 1:18:32.708
Yeah.
The whole world saw it.

1:18:32.708 --> 1:18:33.839

1:18:33.839 --> 1:18:35.798
Gerger, can you

Can you please
come home?

1:18:50.987 --> 1:18:53.250
I am home now, Mom,
and I just...

1:18:55.382 --> 1:18:57.167
I need to be where
I am right now.

1:18:58.864 --> 1:19:00.692
But, listen, I've got
some good news.

1:19:01.998 --> 1:19:03.390
My girlfriend, Cathe,

1:19:05.523 --> 1:19:08.178
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me, Mom.

1:19:10.354 --> 1:19:12.095

1:19:12.878 --> 1:19:14.445

1:19:21.321 --> 1:19:22.540
Not tonight, Mom.

1:19:24.368 --> 1:19:25.586
But maybe next time.

1:19:45.476 --> 1:19:47.086
How's your steak, Dodie?

1:19:47.086 --> 1:19:48.914
I think I wanna be
a vegetarian.

1:19:52.352 --> 1:19:54.354
So, Greg,

1:19:56.748 --> 1:19:59.272
what are your plans
now that you graduated?

1:19:59.272 --> 1:20:01.144
Dad.

1:20:01.144 --> 1:20:04.451
I'm actually, uh, very
involved with the church

1:20:04.451 --> 1:20:06.366
that Cathe
and I are going to.

1:20:06.366 --> 1:20:09.326
Hmm. Yeah. Cathe told us
about the church.

1:20:09.326 --> 1:20:12.416
- Yeah.
- And do they pay you
at, uh, at this church?

1:20:13.721 --> 1:20:15.723
Do they, um... No.

1:20:15.723 --> 1:20:18.161
No, they don't, as of now.

1:20:18.161 --> 1:20:20.511
- It's more of a, um...
- He volunteers.

1:20:20.511 --> 1:20:23.427
Yeah, yeah. It's more
of a volunteer situation.

1:20:23.427 --> 1:20:25.385
But the, uh, the dream

1:20:25.385 --> 1:20:27.997
is to actually start
my own church one day.

1:20:27.997 --> 1:20:29.563
- Yeah, that's the dream.
Hmm.

1:20:30.651 --> 1:20:32.044
We need more churches,
do we, Greg?

1:20:33.567 --> 1:20:35.134
- How do you pay the rent?
- Dad.

1:20:35.134 --> 1:20:36.832
Mom, can you please help?

1:20:36.832 --> 1:20:38.137
It's a fair question.

1:20:38.137 --> 1:20:39.747
You should really
stay for dessert.

1:20:39.747 --> 1:20:41.184
They do blood samples
and fingerprints.

1:20:41.184 --> 1:20:42.185

of everything that Cathe
and I are doing, but

1:20:49.714 --> 1:20:50.933
I just think
that it may be

1:20:50.933 --> 1:20:52.369
because you don't
understand it really.

1:20:52.369 --> 1:20:54.893
And what I want you
to know is that it's real.

1:20:54.893 --> 1:20:56.068
It really is.

1:20:56.068 --> 1:20:59.115
And I've got plans
for my life, sir.

1:20:59.115 --> 1:21:02.858
And I just want Cathe
to be a part of that.

1:21:02.858 --> 1:21:04.947
You're right, Greg.
I don't understand it.

1:21:04.947 --> 1:21:05.991
And I don't need to,

1:21:06.905 --> 1:21:08.124
so long as you understand

1:21:08.124 --> 1:21:10.039
that you are never
gonna marry my daughter.

1:21:10.039 --> 1:21:12.258
Sir, I think that you're
prematurely judging me.

1:21:12.258 --> 1:21:13.694
Just listen to me for a second.

1:21:14.652 --> 1:21:16.828
The answer is no,

1:21:16.828 --> 1:21:19.918

the better, okay?

1:31:55.335 --> 1:31:58.251
I just, uh, wanted to say

1:31:58.251 --> 1:32:03.082
I am very much in favor

1:32:03.082 --> 1:32:05.476
of a future together.

1:32:08.784 --> 1:32:10.089
Yeah. And, uh...

1:32:11.264 --> 1:32:12.265
thank you.

1:32:13.136 --> 1:32:14.224
You're welcome?

1:32:18.054 --> 1:32:19.969
Hey, what's going on?

1:32:19.969 --> 1:32:21.797
It's the same
old story, you know?

1:32:22.449 --> 1:32:23.450
Mom was right.

1:32:24.756 --> 1:32:25.757
Right about what?

1:32:26.628 --> 1:32:27.585
Greg.

1:32:28.194 --> 1:32:29.239
Look at me.

1:32:29.848 --> 1:32:30.849
Right about what?

1:32:31.981 --> 1:32:33.548
The fact
that everyone leaves.

1:32:35.419 --> 1:32:37.377
Eventually.

1:32:37.377 --> 1:32:39.075
You think you found
something solid,

1:32:39.075 --> 1:32:40.250
something firm,

1:32:41.294 --> 1:32:43.253
it all just starts
to fall apart.

1:32:44.341 --> 1:32:45.560
And that's what's
gonna happen to us

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:47.083
because that is what
happens to everyone.

1:32:47.083 --> 1:32:48.345
It's not. Listen.

1:32:49.912 --> 1:32:51.783
I don't care
what my dad says.

1:32:51.783 --> 1:32:54.699
I don't care what your name is,
where you come from,

1:32:54.699 --> 1:32:56.919
and how much money
you make, any of that.

1:32:57.876 --> 1:32:59.530
You have a place
where you belong.

1:33:01.750 --> 1:33:02.838
It's with me.

1:33:03.665 --> 1:33:05.014
It's with us.

1:33:05.014 --> 1:33:07.320
Haven't you learned
anything in the last year?

1:33:08.104 --> 1:33:09.279
Greg.

1:33:09.279 --> 1:33:10.541
I know that you think you mean that...

1:33:10.541 --> 1:33:12.587
I do. I do mean that.

1:33:16.242 --> 1:33:19.681
But I love you,
and I wanna be with you.

1:33:19.681 --> 1:33:21.508
I don't think
that you really

1:33:23.119 --> 1:33:24.381
know what you want.

1:33:26.513 --> 1:33:28.167
Maybe you're the one
who doesn't know what you want.

1:33:28.167 --> 1:33:30.517
Well, obviously,
Cath, look at us!

1:33:30.517 --> 1:33:33.085
Yeah, look at us!
We're... We're arguing.

1:33:33.085 --> 1:33:34.609
We're talking
about our feelings.

1:33:34.609 --> 1:33:36.567
We're... We're working
through things.

1:33:36.567 --> 1:33:39.352
It's called being
in a relationship, idiot.

1:33:43.487 --> 1:33:44.488
What is...

1:33:47.230 --> 1:33:48.623
What is wrong with you?

1:33:51.147 --> 1:33:53.236
Why aren't you
fighting for this?

1:33:53.236 --> 1:33:54.759
Come on, fight for me.

1:33:59.590 --> 1:34:00.591
Wow.

1:34:02.767 --> 1:34:05.422
You know,
you say that you're
looking for the truth.

1:34:07.206 --> 1:34:10.122
I really just think you're
looking for an excuse
to be unhappy.

1:34:12.516 --> 1:34:14.170
So go ahead.

1:34:14.170 --> 1:34:15.650
Don't let me
stand in your way.

1:34:47.812 --> 1:34:50.249
Congrats, Dad.
You win.

1:34:51.076 --> 1:34:52.121
We broke up.

1:34:59.694 --> 1:35:01.304
Cathe, I hope
you know that...

1:35:09.921 --> 1:35:11.357
I love you, Mouse.

1:35:13.751 --> 1:35:15.579
More than anything
in the world.

1:35:18.625 --> 1:35:20.497
I just don't wanna
see you get hurt.

1:35:22.238 --> 1:35:24.631
I just wish
you could experience this.

1:35:25.894 --> 1:35:28.548
Dad, it's not just
for hippies.

1:35:28.548 --> 1:35:30.550
It's so much
bigger than that.

1:35:41.736 --> 1:35:42.867
I love you too.

1:35:45.870 --> 1:35:50.788
<i>♪ Welcome</i>

1:35:52.529 --> 1:35:54.139

1:36:00.058 --> 1:36:05.107

1:36:05.107 --> 1:36:06.717
<i>♪ Believed in ♪</i>

1:36:13.637 --> 1:36:14.856
Everyone's waiting.

1:36:15.595 --> 1:36:16.771
They're expecting Lonnie.

1:36:18.947 --> 1:36:21.166
Chuck, this never
was about Lonnie

1:36:22.254 --> 1:36:23.342
or you

1:36:24.082 --> 1:36:25.605
or any one person.

1:36:26.476 --> 1:36:27.564
He wasn't ready.

1:36:28.652 --> 1:36:29.784
Maybe I wasn't ready.

1:36:30.741 --> 1:36:31.960
I pushed him too hard.

1:36:33.526 --> 1:36:35.746
I made a real mess
of things, Kay.

1:36:37.269 --> 1:36:38.314
You ever think

1:36:39.706 --> 1:36:42.318
maybe God chose
the wrong person?

1:36:43.841 --> 1:36:44.929
Chuck,

1:36:47.845 --> 1:36:49.847
listen to those people.

1:36:51.806 --> 1:36:54.025
Feel the spirit in this place.

1:36:56.201 --> 1:36:57.681
You think you're
important enough

1:36:57.681 --> 1:36:59.204
to get in the way of that?

1:37:02.860 --> 1:37:04.949
Don't be so arrogant
to think that God

1:37:04.949 --> 1:37:06.908
can't work through
your failures.

1:37:55.347 --> 1:37:56.609
Thought I'd
say goodbye.

1:37:56.609 --> 1:37:57.784
Yeah?

1:37:58.742 --> 1:38:00.091
Seems to be going around.

1:38:05.923 --> 1:38:07.446
Why aren't
you in there?

1:38:07.446 --> 1:38:09.013
I feel like
worshipping alone.

1:38:10.667 --> 1:38:13.322
I'm no expert, but I don't
think that's how this works.

1:38:14.758 --> 1:38:15.846
You?

1:38:15.846 --> 1:38:17.065
Headed back to New York.

1:38:18.718 --> 1:38:21.939
You know, when they gave me
this story, I didn't want it.

1:38:23.201 --> 1:38:24.899
Kind of thought
it was beneath me.

1:38:24.899 --> 1:38:28.076
I cover wars
and riots and politics.

1:38:28.076 --> 1:38:29.904
Important things.

1:38:29.904 --> 1:38:32.210
Hippies and Jesus...

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:36.823
Now, man, I don't know.

1:38:36.823 --> 1:38:39.348
Our country is a dark
and divided place.

1:38:40.001 --> 1:38:41.306
But in that tent,

1:38:42.438 --> 1:38:44.396
there's hope.

1:38:44.396 --> 1:38:48.705
And unity and miracles
that I can't even explain.

1:38:48.705 --> 1:38:49.967
And it's spreading.

1:38:50.925 --> 1:38:52.927
It's not just here.

1:38:52.927 --> 1:38:55.886
Where, and how far,
I'm not sure yet.

1:38:55.886 --> 1:38:57.540
That's what
I'm gonna find out.

1:38:59.368 --> 1:39:01.196
I don't know if any
of this is real.

1:39:02.980 --> 1:39:04.547
I kind of hope it is,
to be honest.

1:39:07.071 --> 1:39:08.943
And even if you
can't see it right now,

1:39:10.466 --> 1:39:11.858
it's a family, man.

1:39:13.382 --> 1:39:14.557
Don't give up on it.

1:39:17.473 --> 1:39:18.604
It's my advice, anyway.

1:39:20.606 --> 1:39:22.565
You take care
of yourself, Greg.

1:39:22.565 --> 1:39:23.696
Yeah, you too.

1:39:25.742 --> 1:39:27.439
Uh, hey, who are you
writing this for?

1:39:27.439 --> 1:39:29.180
Is this a book
or newspaper?

1:39:29.789 --> 1:39:30.921
A magazine.

1:39:33.271 --> 1:39:34.229
Which one?

1:40:03.693 --> 1:40:06.696
<i>Race you to the water.
Come on. Let's go!</i>

1:40:12.397 --> 1:40:13.703
It's gonna be
different now.

1:40:14.573 --> 1:40:15.705
You'll see.

1:40:23.452 --> 1:40:26.977
<i>♪ Fly me to the moon</i>

1:40:26.977 --> 1:40:31.938
<i>♪ Let me play

1:40:31.938 --> 1:40:35.768
<i>♪ Let me see

1:40:35.768 --> 1:40:39.729
<i>♪ On Jupiter and Mars ♪</i>

1:40:40.730 --> 1:40:41.774
Hey.

1:40:49.434 --> 1:40:51.175
I don't care about
your face, Mom.

1:40:52.437 --> 1:40:53.873
Yeah?

1:40:53.873 --> 1:40:55.310
How's my hair?

1:40:57.355 --> 1:40:59.140
I love you
just the way you are.

1:41:00.054 --> 1:41:01.055
Why?

1:41:04.232 --> 1:41:06.843
I don't want you
to end up like me, Greg.

1:41:10.586 --> 1:41:11.891
I know that you did
your best.

1:41:13.545 --> 1:41:14.938
I can do better.

1:41:15.330 --> 1:41:16.331
Hey.

1:41:18.637 --> 1:41:19.812
We both can.

1:41:22.859 --> 1:41:24.817
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about your father.

1:41:27.081 --> 1:41:28.299
But, Greg...

1:41:30.693 --> 1:41:32.434
your name is no mistake.

1:41:35.045 --> 1:41:36.351
I can see it.

1:41:38.570 --> 1:41:41.269
Life from death.

1:41:44.315 --> 1:41:46.230
Whatever it is you found,

1:41:49.233 --> 1:41:50.626
maybe it's real.

1:41:52.541 --> 1:41:53.672
It is, Mom.

1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:56.066
It really is.

1:41:58.677 --> 1:42:00.636
Maybe it can be real
for me too.

1:42:05.206 --> 1:42:06.511
I love you, Mom.

1:42:15.259 --> 1:42:17.043
Oh, boy.

1:42:23.485 --> 1:42:25.051
You were out
past curfew.

1:42:26.618 --> 1:42:29.882
- You okay?
- Oh, I'm all right, babe.

1:42:29.882 --> 1:42:32.929
I know I've been distracted.
I haven't been around a lot.

1:42:32.929 --> 1:42:34.060
No, Dad. Stop.

1:42:35.888 --> 1:42:39.022
I have something
that I wanna say to you.

1:42:44.549 --> 1:42:45.681
You see, um...

1:42:47.552 --> 1:42:49.250
I was almost
done with this

1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:51.600
whole Christianity thing.

1:42:53.036 --> 1:42:54.211
And I was like,

1:42:55.473 --> 1:42:56.909
"Where's the love?"
You know?

1:42:58.128 --> 1:43:00.478
"What are we even doing here?

1:43:00.478 --> 1:43:03.873
"Where is Jesus in all of this?

1:43:03.873 --> 1:43:06.180
"He seemed like
a radical dude. I'd like him.

1:43:06.180 --> 1:43:09.313
"But this? I don't know."

1:43:11.185 --> 1:43:14.100
But then you did what nobody
else would even dare to do.

1:43:15.972 --> 1:43:19.584
You let the hippies in.

1:43:19.584 --> 1:43:22.370
Come to find out,
Jesus came in with them.

1:43:24.807 --> 1:43:26.287
And you know what?

1:43:27.636 --> 1:43:29.942
I'm proud of you.

1:43:29.942 --> 1:43:32.380
You opened yourself up to
something you didn't understand.

1:43:33.859 --> 1:43:35.948
And I'm changed
because of it.

1:43:35.948 --> 1:43:37.428
Thousands of us are.

1:43:39.343 --> 1:43:42.868
But you don't have
to carry it all, okay?

1:43:42.868 --> 1:43:44.522
Don't lose yourself
in all of it.

1:43:45.001 --> 1:43:46.785
Okay.

1:43:46.785 --> 1:43:49.527
Also, don't do drugs.

1:44:06.370 --> 1:44:07.589
Thought I might
find you here.

1:44:09.678 --> 1:44:10.896
Do you mind?

1:44:15.814 --> 1:44:18.643
So I recently heard
about this little church

1:44:18.643 --> 1:44:20.166
up in Riverside.

1:44:20.166 --> 1:44:22.343
Pretty near that place
where you did that Bible study.

1:44:24.258 --> 1:44:25.607
And it seems
that their leadership

1:44:25.607 --> 1:44:27.696
had an issue
about something

1:44:27.696 --> 1:44:29.045
and ended splitting up.

1:44:29.045 --> 1:44:31.134
They took everything.

1:44:31.134 --> 1:44:34.268
They left an empty,
abandoned building

1:44:35.399 --> 1:44:36.618
where a church used to be.

1:44:38.750 --> 1:44:39.708
Seems a shame, doesn't it?

1:44:42.319 --> 1:44:44.843
But that's what people do sometimes.

1:44:44.843 --> 1:44:46.584
They lose sight
of what's important.

1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:52.677
Fortunately, God has a long
history of using flawed people.

1:44:54.505 --> 1:44:56.115
I'm sorry, son.

1:44:56.115 --> 1:44:58.030
I didn't stand up for you
when I should have.

1:44:59.118 --> 1:45:00.294
I was wrong for that.

1:45:04.472 --> 1:45:05.429
Thank you.

1:45:09.694 --> 1:45:13.437
So, what happened
to that church?

1:45:15.047 --> 1:45:16.440
Oh, I bought it.

1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:18.007
This morning.

1:45:18.007 --> 1:45:19.704
It's like an empty canvas.

1:45:21.053 --> 1:45:23.621
Seems perfect
for an artist like you.

1:45:27.538 --> 1:45:31.455
You want me to work
there for you?

1:45:31.455 --> 1:45:34.328
It's not my church.
It's yours.

1:45:36.634 --> 1:45:38.680
This movement started
at Calvary,

1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:40.551
but it can't stay here.

1:45:40.551 --> 1:45:43.946
So, go build
something great.

1:45:45.469 --> 1:45:46.557
I don't know
what to say.

1:45:47.515 --> 1:45:48.646
Say yes.

1:45:51.475 --> 1:45:52.824
Yes.

1:45:55.044 --> 1:45:56.306
Pastor Chuck...

1:45:59.788 --> 1:46:01.746
I don't think I can ever
do what you do.

1:46:01.746 --> 1:46:02.791
No.

1:46:03.618 --> 1:46:04.836
You'll do better.

1:46:10.712 --> 1:46:11.756
Hey, man.

1:46:11.756 --> 1:46:13.192
Hey, sorry to bother you.

1:46:13.192 --> 1:46:16.065
Is this the beach
where people get baptized?

1:46:16.065 --> 1:46:18.110
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Pirate's Cove.

1:46:18.502 --> 1:46:19.808
Cool.

1:46:19.808 --> 1:46:21.157
My friends and I heard
about it on the radio

1:46:21.157 --> 1:46:22.463
and drove all the way here.

1:46:22.463 --> 1:46:23.551
Where from?

1:46:24.073 --> 1:46:27.293
Texas.

1:46:27.293 --> 1:46:31.733
We wanna get baptized
but didn't know how or when...

1:47:18.562 --> 1:47:20.216
Good evening, sir.

Um, I know that you don't
like me very much and...

She's in the dining room.

1:47:25.961 --> 1:47:26.962
Oh.

1:47:27.441 --> 1:47:28.442
Okay.

1:47:30.095 --> 1:47:31.662
I didn't see that coming.

1:47:31.662 --> 1:47:32.707
Go ahead, son.

1:47:34.491 --> 1:47:35.840
Hey. Hi.

1:47:36.493 --> 1:47:37.712
Hi, Greg.

1:47:37.712 --> 1:47:39.670
Hi. Good evening.

1:47:39.670 --> 1:47:41.324
Sorry to barge in so late...

1:47:42.281 --> 1:47:44.370
I, uh...

1:47:44.370 --> 1:47:46.547
I did not know how wet
I was until just right now.

1:47:46.547 --> 1:47:47.896
And your hardwood floors.

1:47:47.896 --> 1:47:49.158
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:47:49.158 --> 1:47:50.768
And you're not
wearing any shoes.

1:47:52.596 --> 1:47:55.251
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not.
You're right about that.

1:47:55.251 --> 1:47:58.080
But I just gotta tell you something.

1:47:58.080 --> 1:47:59.734
I've been really
stupid lately.

1:48:01.300 --> 1:48:02.998
Obviously, you know that.

1:48:02.998 --> 1:48:04.260
I'm sure you've heard.

1:48:05.870 --> 1:48:08.656
I am so sorry
that I pushed you away.

1:48:08.656 --> 1:48:09.874
And I hurt you.

1:48:10.962 --> 1:48:12.094
It was so dumb.

1:48:12.834 --> 1:48:14.009
It was really dumb.

1:48:14.009 --> 1:48:16.402
- Really dumb.
- It really was.

1:48:16.402 --> 1:48:17.752
The dumbest.

1:48:17.752 --> 1:48:19.231
Yeah.

1:48:19.231 --> 1:48:21.146
But I wanted to ask you

1:48:21.146 --> 1:48:23.932
if you still mean
what you said the other day

1:48:23.932 --> 1:48:25.063
about what you want

1:48:26.282 --> 1:48:27.326
with us.

1:48:29.633 --> 1:48:31.722
Because I got
really big plans, Cathe.

1:48:34.333 --> 1:48:36.422
Hopes and dreams.
I've got goals.

1:48:39.251 --> 1:48:40.992
And I wanna do it with you.

1:48:42.254 --> 1:48:43.386
Together.

1:48:43.386 --> 1:48:44.430
You and I.

1:48:46.824 --> 1:48:48.217
Because I get you.

1:48:48.217 --> 1:48:49.697
I need you.

1:48:49.697 --> 1:48:51.046
I want you.

1:48:52.830 --> 1:48:53.918
And I...

1:48:53.918 --> 1:48:54.963
"Love you"?

1:48:57.487 --> 1:48:58.488
Yeah.

1:48:59.794 --> 1:49:00.882
Like, a lot.

1:49:02.492 --> 1:49:04.625
And so, what? What is this?

1:49:04.625 --> 1:49:07.105
Is this your way
of proposing to me?

1:49:07.541 --> 1:49:09.412
Oh. Um...

1:49:10.631 --> 1:49:11.632
Um...

1:49:13.372 --> 1:49:14.722
Uh...

1:49:20.466 --> 1:49:22.164
What would you say
if it was?

1:49:22.164 --> 1:49:24.601
I would say...

1:49:24.601 --> 1:49:28.649
that if you ever get
in the way of me and God

1:49:28.649 --> 1:49:30.259
it's over between us.

1:49:30.955 --> 1:49:32.087
So,

1:49:33.349 --> 1:49:34.785
is that your way
of saying yes?

1:49:37.048 --> 1:49:38.049
Yes.

1:49:49.452 --> 1:49:50.671
You're so wet.
