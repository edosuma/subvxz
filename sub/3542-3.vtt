00:02.120 --> 00:04.646
Mrs. Lockwood.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.768
- Leaving so soon?
- Aah!

00:06.920 --> 00:09.241
I've gotten myself
into a vampire situation.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.601
Hello?

00:12.680 --> 00:14.728
- Daddy?
- Where's Stefan?

00:14.880 --> 00:18.202
He gave himself over to Klaus.
- You can embrace what you truly are.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.840
- A ripper.
- Stefan can be saved.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.205
I'll help you bring him back.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.805
So is this your master plan?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.968
To build an army of hybrid slaves?

00:27.120 --> 00:29.168
Not slaves. Soldiers.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.522
Something's wrong. They're all dead.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.365
I should be able to turn them.
I killed the doppelganger.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.488
I did everything I was told!

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

00:48.800 --> 00:50.211
You're interrupting my drink.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.091
You miss me?

00:53.800 --> 00:56.371
Katherine. Where are you?

00:56.520 --> 00:58.966
Lurking outside your window,
pining away.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.290
- What do you want?
- I'm homesick. What have I missed?

01:03.440 --> 01:07.161
Stefan's still Klaus' little prisoner,
Elena still thinks she can save him...

01:07.320 --> 01:09.641
and no one's thought about you
since you left.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.883
And what about you? Now that you've
given up on your brother...

01:13.040 --> 01:16.362
you're plotting some sort of way
of moving in on his girlfriend?

01:16.520 --> 01:19.285
I didn't give up on him.
I just don't know where he is.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.010
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:23.040 --> 01:24.690
But you do.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.604
Are you trailing them?

01:26.760 --> 01:30.287
A hybrid who wants me dead,
and his sidekick who's off the rails?

01:30.480 --> 01:33.370
- I couldn't be further away.
- Means you know where they are.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.286
All I know is that Klaus pitched a fit
once his hybrids didn't work.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.727
- Now he's looking for answers.
- How do you know?

01:39.880 --> 01:43.771
Spend 500 years running, there will be
a few people looking out for you.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.208
Is that what you're doing?
Looking out for my brother?

01:47.360 --> 01:48.771
<i>Maybe, maybe not.</i>

01:48.960 --> 01:50.530
I'm conflicted.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.246
Where are they?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.040
Welcome back to Chicago, Stefan.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.089
What are we doing here?
- I know how much you loved it here.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.484
Bringing back memories
of the good old ripper days?

02:10.680 --> 02:12.728
Blacked out most of them.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.089
Lot of blood, lot of partying.
The details are all a blur.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.123
Well, that is a crying shame.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.561
The details are what makes it legend.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.126
<i>Word was the ripper of Monterey
got lonely.</i>

02:26.280 --> 02:28.328
<i>So he escaped to the city for comfort.</i>

02:28.480 --> 02:29.766
<i>It was Prohibition.</i>

02:29.960 --> 02:33.487
<i>Everything was off-limits then,
which made everything so much fun</i>

03:16.440 --> 03:20.445
<i>I went down to St. James Infirmary</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:24.446
<i>My heart felt just like lead</i>

03:24.640 --> 03:28.804
<i>He was all I had to live for</i>

03:28.960 --> 03:32.760
<i>I wish that it was me instead</i>

03:35.200 --> 03:38.488
Guess who my eyes
have just spied, ladies.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.486
- Looking for a good time, Mr. Salvatore?
- Save me a dance, Gloria.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.845
Ooh. Please, help yourself.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.805
- Oh, I always do.
- Hmm.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.006
Careful, Mr. Salvatore.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.490
You're still wearing your date.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.045
She's lovely.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.209
No, no, no.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.163
Who are you?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.769
Shh.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.371
Chicago was magical.

04:25.560 --> 04:30.441
Yeah, well, I'll take your word for it.
Like I said, I don't remember most of it.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.570
- Down to business, then?
- Why am I still with you?

04:33.720 --> 04:37.406
We had our fun, your hybrids failed.
I mean, don't you want to move on?

04:37.560 --> 04:39.449
We're going to see my favorite witch.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.683
If anyone who can help us
with our hybrid problem...

04:44.160 --> 04:46.162
it's her.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.965
Mm. Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.970
What are you doing? Get out.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.851
You know you were dreaming about me.
Explains the drool.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.562
Oh, my God.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.681
Six a.m.? Seriously? Do you really have
nothing better to do at 6 a.m.?

05:17.840 --> 05:20.684
Fine. Don't come with me
to bring Stefan home.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.644
See you.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.003
Wait, wait, wait. What? What are you
talking about? Where is he?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.241
Windy City.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.164
- He's in Chicago? How do you know?
- Came to me in a dream. I was naked.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.766
You would've loved it. Start packing.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.648
- Is he okay?
- Well, let's just say...

05:37.800 --> 05:39.802
he's not there to meet Oprah.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.769
Ooh.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.400
Put these in the "yes" pile.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.123
Daddy, are you there?

06:01.760 --> 06:03.524
Why won't you talk to me?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.927
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.686
Dad.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.207
I need an answer.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.004
How do you walk in the sunlight?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.960
Please, let me go.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.569
Sweetheart, please.
Just answer me and we'll get on with it.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.961
Is that all you wanna know?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.322
That's all I wanna know.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.846
Interesting.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.529
No, Dad, no. What are you...?

06:51.720 --> 06:53.324
What are you doing?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.369
Your ancestors built this place.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.246
People figured it was for unruly
prisoners of the jailhouse...

06:59.400 --> 07:01.243
but they had something else
in mind.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.922
Vervain in the ventilation system
to keep their subject weak.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.727
Reinforced steel containment chair.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.604
And that.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.202
What are you doing?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.404
Blood controls you, sweetheart.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.569
This is how I'm gonna fix you.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.728
What?

07:44.920 --> 07:46.126
Sure hope we find him.

07:46.280 --> 07:50.205
It would suck if the last memento
of Stefan was that crappy old necklace.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.371
- It's an antique, Damon. Like you.
- Hmm.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.685
Read this.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.447
Paints a pretty little picture of Stefan's
first experience in Chicago.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.763
It's Stefan's diary. I'm not gonna
invade his private thoughts.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.725
You need to be prepared
for what you're about to see.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.606
I've seen Stefan in his darkest periods.
I can handle it.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.962
Here's one. "March 12, 1922.
I've blacked out days.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.044
I wake up in strangers' blood
in places I don't recognize...

08:23.240 --> 08:25.004
with women I don't remember."

08:25.160 --> 08:27.367
Ah! I'm shocked.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.885
Stefan's not a virgin?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.604
Eyes on the road, Grandma.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.888
Fine, back to my game.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.008
Tell me if you see a Florida plate.

08:37.159 --> 08:41.768
<i>You don't add up to much</i>

08:46.280 --> 08:49.966
<i>Ain't got that glamour touch</i>

08:51.040 --> 08:52.883
Let's keep it going. Garรงon!

08:53.040 --> 08:54.530
Sorry to crash the fun, boys...

08:54.720 --> 08:58.122
but some of us actually came here
to hear the music, not you.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.001
Ooh. I am so sorry, sweetheart.
Are we offending you?

09:05.560 --> 09:09.201
It'd take a lot more
than a baby face like this to offend me.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.562
Ooh!

09:12.400 --> 09:14.243
Ahem. Hey.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.807
- Are you ever gonna tell me your name?
- Sure.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.803
When you earn it.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.404
Now do Gloria a favor
and stick a sock in it.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.804
<i>You're very short on looks</i>

09:30.840 --> 09:36.131
<i>Dumb when it comes to books</i>

09:37.440 --> 09:38.930
Looks familiar, doesn't it?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.082
I can't believe this place is still here.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.249
You gotta be kidding me.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.166
So a hybrid walks into a bar,
says to the bartender...

09:47.320 --> 09:48.924
Stop.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.641
You may be invincible,
but that doesn't make you funny.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.922
- I remember you.
- Yeah.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.447
- You're Gloria.
- Mm-hm.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.888
- Shouldn't you be...?
- Old and dead?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.361
Now, if I die,
who's gonna run this place, huh?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.204
Gloria's a very powerful witch.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.284
I can slow the aging down some.
Herbs and spells.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.602
But don't worry,
it'll catch up to me one day.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.484
Stefan, why don't you go and fix us up
a little something from behind the bar?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.769
Yeah, sure thing.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.529
- You look ravishing, by the way.
- Don't.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.008
I know why you're here.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.164
A hybrid out to make more hybrids?
That kind of news travels.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.646
So, what am I doing wrong?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.245
I broke the curse.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.124
Obviously you did something wrong.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.648
Look, every spell has a loophole...

10:37.800 --> 10:42.010
but a curse that old, we'd have
to contact the witch who created it.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.567
Well, that would be the Original witch.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.688
- She's very dead.
- I know.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.531
And for me to contact her,
I'll need help.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.441
- Bring me Rebekah.
- Rebekah.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.482
Rebekah is a bit preoccupied.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.769
She has what I need. Bring her to me.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.003
What is this?

11:06.760 --> 11:08.967
I told you, Stefan.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.443
Chicago's a magical place.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.648
But this is me.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.729
With you.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.967
Caroline, it's Mom.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.289
Just coming up for air after a few
all-nighters at the station.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.521
Thought we'd have lunch...

11:30.680 --> 11:32.489
and you'd remind me
I promised not to work so hard.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.771
Aah! Please, stop!

11:40.920 --> 11:44.049
Please, stop! Please!

11:49.280 --> 11:53.205
I don't hurt anyone, I swear.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.169
I swear.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.368
I can handle the urges. I can.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.002
If you could handle it,
this wouldn't happen.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.771
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.801
I'm conditioning you
to associate vampirism with pain.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.207
In time, the thought of human blood...

12:14.360 --> 12:17.967
will make you repress
your vampire instincts completely.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.361
That's impossible.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.683
Daddy, you can't change who I am.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.888
- Yes, I can.
- No.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.088
You remember this feeling.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.890
No, no, no!

12:34.480 --> 12:37.802
Stefan could live anywhere
in Chicago and he chose this?

12:37.960 --> 12:40.964
There used to be an all-girls high school
around the corner...

12:41.120 --> 12:43.726
but it shut down for
attendance issues. Weird.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.362
If you're trying to scare me into giving up
and going back, it's not gonna work.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.681
Shh.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.804
Here we are.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.128
Stefan's second-personality home.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.047
- He obviously hasn't been here.
- Tour's not over yet.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.323
Stefan hid his alcohol.
What a monster.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.723
Look harder.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.123
- It's a list of names.
Mm-hm.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.247
Are these all of his victims?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.247
Still handling it?

13:48.920 --> 13:52.606
What were you doing in the 1920s,
paving the way for women's liberation?

13:52.760 --> 13:55.445
I was around. Chicago's a big city.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.324
Stefan was a cocky ripper douche...

13:57.520 --> 14:01.844
but I could avoid him and still indulge
in a few Daisy Buchanans of my own.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.411
Ugh.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.801
- Where are you going?
- His old stomping ground.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.530
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.081
You stay here
and whip up an actual plan.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.328
I'll come back when I find him.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.651
This doesn't make any sense.
Why don't I remember you?

14:17.800 --> 14:20.041
You said that time
had a lot of dark holes.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.010
- If you knew me, why haven't you said?
- I'm a little busy.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.050
- Memory lane will have to wait.
- What the hell is going on?

14:26.200 --> 14:27.850
Answer me.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.324
Let's just say
we didn't get off to a brilliant start.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.644
To be honest, I hated you.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.202
It's beautiful.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.089
A witch gave it to me.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.130
- Supposedly it's magical.
- And is it'?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.760
It brought me love, didn't it?

15:08.280 --> 15:10.760
It's late, Rebekah. We're leaving.
- Get off me.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.368
- Who is this guy?
- Don't. He'll kill you.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.644
Nik's a lot stronger than he looks.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.727
So this is the famous Stefan Salvatore
I've been hearing so much about.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.928
You're right. He does have funny hair.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.042
I'm bored. I wanna go.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.328
Then go without me.
I'm not your girlfriend.

15:29.480 --> 15:35.203
No, you're my sister,
which means you have to do as I say.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.882
<i>Your sister?</i>

15:41.200 --> 15:44.761
So I knew another Original vampire?

15:46.120 --> 15:49.567
If you can't handle it, then don't ask.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.805
I don't recognize her.

16:06.960 --> 16:10.407
Don't tell her that.
Rebekah's temper's worse than mine.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.089
Time to wake up, little sister.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.248
Any day now, Rebekah.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.526
She's being dramatic.

16:23.680 --> 16:27.127
Look, why don't you just tell me
what the hell is going on?

16:27.280 --> 16:30.363
I mean, you obviously want me here
for a reason, right?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.807
- Well, you have many useful talents.
- Do I?

16:32.960 --> 16:36.362
In fact, I learned some
of my favorite tricks from you.

16:36.520 --> 16:41.242
- Mm.
- So, Stefan, enlighten me.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.722
What makes you worthy
of an Original like my sister?

16:44.880 --> 16:48.407
She's pure vampire and you're no more
than a diluted bloodline.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.042
Don't listen to him, Stefan.
Nik's an elitist.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.441
And where's the rest of your family?

16:54.600 --> 16:57.046
Well, let's see.
Um, I killed most of them.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.605
But not all.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.489
And you're okay with that?

17:00.680 --> 17:03.126
Well, we all had the chance
to choose a side.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.085
I chose the right one, eventually.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.450
Where the hell's my wife?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.127
- I don't know. I give up.
- Think you're so tough?

17:13.280 --> 17:15.169
Hiding in your bar,
drinking your liquor.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.527
A telephone call to Chicago P.D.
might set you straight.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.369
- Ooh! Ha, ha!
- Ha, ha!

17:20.800 --> 17:24.327
Ahem. Lila? Lila, please,
come here for a second.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.921
Oh, thank God.
Come on, we're leaving.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.809
Oh, no, no, no.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.803
You're sitting.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.324
Come here.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.327
Stefan, don't be mean.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.167
What the hell are you doing?

18:00.280 --> 18:04.649
Thank you so much, Lila.
Why don't you go and bandage that up?

18:04.800 --> 18:08.043
I'd like you to join me for a drink.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.724
What kind of sick freaks are you?

18:10.880 --> 18:13.360
I said drink.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.529
- I didn't catch your name.
- Go to hell.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.521
You want another sip?

18:29.680 --> 18:32.206
Liam. Liam Grant.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.089
Liam Grant.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.611
Have another sip, Liam.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.251
Finish it.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.364
I was your number one fan.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.360
Why should I believe any of this?

18:50.080 --> 18:52.924
When she wakes up,
tell her to meet us at Gloria's bar.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.402
Then volunteer your carotid artery
and let her feed until you die.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.609
- Where you going?
- You think I'm lying?

18:58.800 --> 19:01.690
We knew each other.
You trusted me with one of your secrets.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.683
- Now I'm gonna prove it to you.
- How?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.320
We're going to your old apartment.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.924
All right.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.721
Well, look what the wind blew in.
Last I heard, you hated this place.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.601
Gloria? Damn. If I knew you were gonna
age like this, I would've stuck around.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.728
Ha, ha. I always did like you better.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.929
But I see your brother is still running
in the wrong crowd.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.127
You've seen him?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.887
With Klaus. Bad combo.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.280
You know where they went?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.930
They'll be back here tonight.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.287
They're out running a little errand
for me.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.851
Gloria...

19:45.640 --> 19:46.880
Don't be a tease.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.602
What kind of errand?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.770
I don't think so.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.487
You may be cute,
but you're still a vampire.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.089
<i>STE FAN I April, 1922.</i>

20:03.240 --> 20:06.244
<i>Lexi found me last night,
dragged me off the train tracks.</i>

20:06.800 --> 20:09.280
<i>Thinks she can make me care again.</i>

20:10.280 --> 20:11.964
<i>June, 1924.</i>

20:12.120 --> 20:13.645
<i>Ah, Lexi's driving me crazy.</i>

20:13.800 --> 20:16.804
<i>More animal blood, more misery.</i>

20:18.120 --> 20:22.808
<i>1935. The cravings are there,
but it's easier.</i>

20:25.160 --> 20:28.960
<i>Heh-heh. Getting me to laugh.</i>

20:36.520 --> 20:38.682
What a charming little homestead.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.401
Do you feel that?

20:55.040 --> 20:56.849
Is anybody here?

21:00.120 --> 21:03.329
It's been vacant for decades.
People must break in all the time.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.246
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Your friend Liam Grant...

21:08.440 --> 21:11.171
the one who drank
his wife's blood...

21:11.320 --> 21:14.369
I never could figure out
why you wanted his name.

21:14.520 --> 21:20.846
And then you told me your little secret, it
was all part of your special little ritual.

21:25.760 --> 21:30.687
- To write it down.
- And relive the kill over and over again.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.401
You believe me now?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.563
Look what I found.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.242
1918, single malt.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.607
My favorite.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.560
Let's go and find someone
to pair it with.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.043
Finally, I called you an hour ago.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.761
Make yourself presentable.
I know where Stefan's gonna be tonight.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.766
I was discovered by Klaus and you're
worried about what I'm wearing?

23:06.920 --> 23:10.288
I had an hour to realize what a bad idea
it was to leave you alone...

23:10.440 --> 23:11.930
process it, and move on.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.329
Are you okay?

23:16.920 --> 23:19.002
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.447
Get dressed.
You're all road-trippy and gross.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.768
- You know where he's gonna be?
- With Klaus.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.247
So I'll distract Klaus
and you deal with Stefan.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.641
Okay. Thank you.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.727
You're gonna have about
five minutes, tops...

23:33.880 --> 23:36.121
before that hybrid freak
rips my heart out.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.442
So, please...

23:38.680 --> 23:40.364
tell me you can do this.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.528
I can do this.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.806
Where's Rebekah?

23:45.960 --> 23:49.931
She'll be here.
I can't just conjure her on demand.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.923
What's with you?
I thought Chicago was your playground.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.361
This is why you asked me
to be your wingman?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.683
Because you liked the way
that I tortured innocent people.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.684
- Well, that's certainly half of it.
- What's the other half?

24:03.840 --> 24:06.127
The other half, Stefan...

24:06.280 --> 24:10.001
is that you used to want
to be my wingman.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.367
They're jealous.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.729
Your family wants you dead
because they can never be what you are.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.963
- What, an abomination?
- No...

24:20.120 --> 24:22.088
a king.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.601
Huh? Ha, ha.

24:26.280 --> 24:31.081
- Look at us. Two sad orphans.
- Ah.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.446
- My sister fancies you, you know.
- Mm.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.331
But I should warn you...

24:39.480 --> 24:41.881
Rebekah doesn't do anything
half-speed.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.844
That includes falling in love.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.611
So just be careful. She's totally mad.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.769
I appreciate the advice.

24:53.080 --> 24:57.881
And when the point comes
where she inevitably leaves you...

24:58.040 --> 25:03.285
she can't help it, it's just who she is,
don't let your heart do anything stupid.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.082
You know what?
You're a good friend, Nik.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.442
I'm glad I met you.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.648
To friendship.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.007
I want you to know...

25:31.160 --> 25:34.084
when Carol Lockwood
called and told me about you...

25:35.560 --> 25:38.086
I sat down and cried.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.529
Dad, I'm okay.

25:43.680 --> 25:48.811
I've learned to adapt.
I don't need to be fixed.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.843
I can't be fixed.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.046
I've always taught you
to try your best.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.403
I need you to try your best now.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.804
There. See? You're doing it.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.843
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Fight the urge.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.725
- Daddy, I'm starving.
- I know you are, Car. Try.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.207
Why? You know this isn't
going to work.

26:14.360 --> 26:17.603
- It has to work, it's the only option.
- Why are you trying to fix me?

26:17.840 --> 26:19.604
So I don't have to kill you.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.091
Daddy, I'm sorry.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.162
Sun's gone down.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.410
We'll try again tomorrow.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.241
Hello, Bill.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.921
Put the gun down, Liz.
I know what I'm doing.

27:02.080 --> 27:06.005
That's our daughter in there.
She looks up to you. She loves you.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.367
Then she'll trust me
to do the right thing.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.565
Let me do this, Liz.
Not because she's a monster...

27:13.440 --> 27:14.771
but because we love her.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.489
Tyler.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.845
You're not going in there.

27:31.720 --> 27:32.960
Go ahead.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.284
Tyler.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.168
It's okay,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.727
My ring.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.326
<i>My...</i>

27:59.360 --> 28:00.441
Okay.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.089
So I'm confused.
If we were such great friends...

28:13.240 --> 28:17.211
then why do I only know you
as the hybrid dick...

28:17.360 --> 28:20.762
who sacrificed my girlfriend
on an altar of fire?

28:21.440 --> 28:23.044
Huh?

28:23.880 --> 28:26.201
All good things must come to an end.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.008
- It's the police!
- Chicago police!

29:07.080 --> 29:08.844
They're using wooden bullets.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.287
- They know.
- That means he's here.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.563
Who? Who's here?

29:14.720 --> 29:18.281
Rebekah?
Come on, we gotta go, sweetheart.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.602
- What the hell's going on?
- Stefan.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.364
Go!

29:26.080 --> 29:27.764
Stefan.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.966
I'm sorry, but the fun has to end here.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.084
- What are you talking about?
- You must forget Rebekah and me.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.084
Until I say otherwise,
you never knew us, Stefan.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.040
Thank you. I had forgotten
what it was like to have a brother.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.250
You compelled me to forget.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.487
It was time for Rebekah and I
to move on.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.043
Better to have a clean slate.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.809
But why?

30:06.240 --> 30:08.129
You shouldn't have
to cover your tracks.

30:09.840 --> 30:12.446
Unless you're running from someone.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.366
Story time's over.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.089
I need another drink.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.969
A real one.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.571
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

30:46.720 --> 30:50.008
You kill Andie one day, save my life
the next. Are you good, bad? Pick one.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.680
Klaus almost saw Elena today.
Get her out of Chicago.

30:52.840 --> 30:56.322
She's not going anywhere until she's
got you checked into vampire rehab.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.561
Trust me, I've tried.

30:57.720 --> 31:00.690
She's the key to everything.
Klaus can't know she's alive.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.525
- What?
- She was supposed to die in the sacrifice.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.967
Now Klaus can't create
any new hybrids.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.646
His witch is seconds away
from figuring that out.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.481
Tell Elena to go home
and forget about me.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.926
Tell her yourself.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.049
Last call. Drink them up.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.651
I see they've opened the doors
to the riffraff now.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.971
Oh, honey, I've been called worse.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.246
You don't give up, do you?

31:47.400 --> 31:51.291
Give me my brother back
and you'll never have to see me again.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.649
I am torn. You see, I promised Stefan
I wouldn't let you die...

31:54.800 --> 31:57.246
but how many freebies
did I really sign up for?

31:57.400 --> 32:01.849
And clearly you want to die,
otherwise you wouldn't be here, so...

32:02.520 --> 32:06.127
What can I say? I'm a thrill seeker.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.607
You shouldn't be here.
- Where else would I be?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.326
What do you want?

32:15.480 --> 32:17.926
Damon won't be able
to distract Klaus for long.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.405
Come home.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.521
How much clearer can I make it?

32:44.680 --> 32:46.444
I don't want to come home.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.164
Oh, dear, what was that?

32:53.040 --> 32:58.046
I'm a little boozy, so you'll forgive me
if I miss your heart the first few tries.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.321
No, that's not it. Hmm...

33:02.480 --> 33:06.121
Aah!
- Oh. Almost.

33:07.040 --> 33:12.331
You want a partner in crime?
Forget Stefan. I'm so much more fun.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.290
You won't be any fun
after you're dead.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.171
- Really?
- Not in my bar. You take it outside.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.369
You don't have to negotiate
your brother's freedom.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.410
When I'm done with him,
he won't wanna go back.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.562
Klaus is obsessed
with siring these hybrids.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.849
The second he knows you're alive,
he'll figure out why it's not working.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.044
I know you're trying to protect me,
but I can't let you do it.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.247
Come with me, please.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.847
What do you expect if I do, huh?
It's never gonna be the same, Elena.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.328
- I know that.
- I don't think you do.

33:58.760 --> 34:03.084
I've left bodies scattered
from Florida to Tennessee.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.811
Innocent people. Humans.

34:05.960 --> 34:10.123
Lexi found you like this before,
in the '20s, and she saved you.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.089
And do you know what I did
after that?

34:12.239 --> 34:15.369
I spent 30 years trying
to pull myself together.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.286
To a vampire, that's nothing.
To you, that's half your life.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.411
- I can't give up on you, Stefan.
- Yes, you can.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.130
It's done.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.168
That part of my life is done.

34:28.320 --> 34:31.641
I don't wanna see you.
I don't wanna be with you.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.806
I just want you to go.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.884
You okay?

35:08.800 --> 35:10.529
Just drive.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.450
Thank you.

35:25.880 --> 35:29.805
Honey, your dad, all our families...

35:29.960 --> 35:32.884
we have beliefs that have been passed
through generations.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.281
We were taught never to stray
from them.

35:35.480 --> 35:36.720
- You did.
- You taught me...

35:36.880 --> 35:39.121
to look at things in a different way.

35:39.360 --> 35:43.251
I just thought that he was the one
who got me.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.402
He did. He will again.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.404
Hey, Mom?

35:59.480 --> 36:01.289
Thanks for believing in me.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.400
Would now be a bad time...

36:09.600 --> 36:11.762
to give you crap
about sneaking out on me?

36:27.800 --> 36:29.928
He hates me.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.170
My dad hates me.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.970
Hey. he)'...

36:53.920 --> 36:58.642
Rebekah, it's your big brother.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.962
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.801
Go to hell, Nik.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.642
Hurry up, Rebekah.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.165
- Let's go.
- He'll be here any second.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.163
Do you wanna die?
We've been found. We need to move.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.322
- Not without Stefan.
- Stefan's not coming.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.246
We have to disappear.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.647
He'll draw too much attention.
Let him go.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.887
What did you do?

37:24.040 --> 37:26.168
We don't have time
for one of your tantrums.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.051
I don't want to run anymore, Nik.
All we do is run.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.525
I want to be with Stefan.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.522
Fine. Then choose.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.330
Him or me?

37:40.520 --> 37:44.286
That's what I thought. Get in the truck.
Let's go.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.528
Goodbye, Nik.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.726
Don't pout.
You knew it wouldn't kill me.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.645
No, but I was hoping
it would hurt more.

38:20.800 --> 38:24.885
I understand that you're upset
with me, Rebekah...

38:25.800 --> 38:28.929
so I'm gonna let that go,
just this once.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.811
I brought you a little peace offering.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.287
You can come in.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.725
Stefan.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.849
Now you remember.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.080
Rebekah.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.288
Stefan.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.365
Hey, buddy,
take a picture of my brother and me.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.286
I remember you.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.200
We were friends.

39:28.360 --> 39:31.364
We are friends.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.440
And now the reason you're here.

39:36.640 --> 39:41.123
Gloria tells me you know how
to contact the Original witch.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.204
- "The Original witch"?
- What do you have that Gloria needs?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.562
Where's my necklace?
What did you do with it?

39:51.720 --> 39:54.007
- I never take it off.
- I didn't touch it.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.010
- We need to find it.
- Tell me that's not what she needs.

39:57.200 --> 40:00.647
Tell me that's not what she needs,
Rebekah!

40:12.000 --> 40:14.685
Okay, you were right. He was there.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.171
<i>I'm always right.</i>

40:16.320 --> 40:18.561
Let me guess,
it ended in tears and heartbreak.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.846
Where are you?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.321
Why, do you wanna come
rub sunscreen on my back?

40:22.520 --> 40:26.764
I'm thinking Europe. Italy maybe.
Or Spain.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.400
You were always a sucker
for those lazy afternoons.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.007
Keep guessing, Damon. Bye-bye.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.044
Hey, kid. Chicago P.D.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.961
I'm not afraid of you.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.690
Oh, I'm not here for you.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.730
Have you seen these two?

41:24.880 --> 41:27.121
I've never seen those people before
in my life.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.402
Wrap it up, boys. We're through here.
