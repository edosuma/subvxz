WEBVTT

00:21.640 --> 00:26.719
Blessed are you, Adonai our God.
Sovereign of all.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.800
Who hallows us with mitzwat,

00:31.399 --> 00:35.119
Commanding us
to kindle the light of the Shabbat.

00:47.039 --> 00:49.840
-Did you go down to Miller's Court?
-It was miss Kelly.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.880
-They are taking her to the morgue.
-And the other girls?

00:52.960 --> 00:55.399
Most likely at the pub.

00:56.759 --> 01:00.719
-Not on the sabbath...
-I am sure the Lord will understand.

01:01.719 --> 01:04.400
This man must be stopped.

01:05.159 --> 01:07.599
At any cost.

01:30.239 --> 01:32.400
Get off me!

01:36.519 --> 01:38.519
What did they say?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.400
They're setting sail for
my old country in the morning.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.719
Is there room for us on the ship?

01:43.799 --> 01:47.959
If we give them a good time
on the way over...

01:48.040 --> 01:51.959
Would you rather end up
like Mary Jane and the others?

02:20.800 --> 02:24.759
-Can't you read the sign?
-You listen to me, my friend.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.879
This gentleman here
is assisting the Scotland Yard.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.039
-That nosey Jew is here again.
-Bloody hell.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.439
Do you think he might be Jack?

03:46.960 --> 03:53.280
Despite complaints against
the man who claims to be King Olaf,-

03:53.360 --> 03:57.879
-the American video sharing service
will still not shut down the channel.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.400
Olaf Haraldsson fell at Stiklestad
in 1030, according to history.

04:02.479 --> 04:05.919
But the man claims someone
else died in his place.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.319
That was the morning news...

04:35.480 --> 04:39.199
This is U-05 calling Sierra 3.0.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.839
-Sierra 3.0 responding.
-This is U-05.

04:44.920 --> 04:50.199
We have a possible drug overdose
in the old service tunnel at Tøyen.

04:50.279 --> 04:53.560
I'm on my way.
Over and out.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.560
Workadaptation ongoing

05:28.439 --> 05:31.800
The Citizen!
Buy it here.

05:39.519 --> 05:43.839
They're littering the streets,
and they molest our women!

06:17.439 --> 06:20.720
-Rough start?
-You're fucking right it was.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.000
Not going to bitch about being
paired with the viking again?

06:25.079 --> 06:27.759
I'm realising you're
the kind of pain I have to live with.

06:27.839 --> 06:32.959
-Kind of like my haemorrhoids.
-Are you reaching out to me, Wenche?

06:33.040 --> 06:38.079
If you like being compared to a
bloody lump in my anus, fine by me.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.920
Yes?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.720
It's in here.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.519
Fuck.

07:37.439 --> 07:40.439
-Is this the only entrance?
-I'm afraid so.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.680
Call in the team.
This is not an overdose.

08:19.360 --> 08:24.680
How would you describe your mental
state after becoming clean?

08:26.279 --> 08:29.040
Completely fine.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.120
The reason I'm dwelling
on this now is that,-

08:34.200 --> 08:39.000
-when you quit, you showed signs
of a behaviour that was quite...

08:39.080 --> 08:41.840
-Well, how should I put it?
-Paranoid?

08:41.919 --> 08:45.559
So, you no longer believe the
government broke into your flat-

08:45.639 --> 08:50.159
-and stole a hard drive you got
from the Neo-Luddite community?

08:50.240 --> 08:55.679
That was most likely a hallucinogenic
bi-product of going cold turkey.

08:55.759 --> 09:01.200
That almost sounded like something
right out of a psychiatry textbook.

09:01.279 --> 09:06.639
Am I not allowed to try to
analyse my own problems anymore?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.200
Investigations of the
woman's hair and teeth-

09:10.279 --> 09:13.960
-indicate that she's a beforeigner
of 19th century origin.

09:14.039 --> 09:17.360
She was without ID papers,
and we got no hits in the database,-

09:17.440 --> 09:19.960
-so for now,
we have no identity for her.

09:20.039 --> 09:25.039
She is most likely unregistered or
has entered the country illegally.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.440
-Do we have a motive?
-No. It's too early to speculate.

09:28.519 --> 09:33.360
Many things indicate that the woman
was involved in criminal activity.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.519
Do we have any relevant observations
of a possible perpetrator?

10:10.240 --> 10:14.399
Look. The shaft continues from
where we found the woman-

10:14.480 --> 10:17.679
- to the tunnel on the eastern side.
-Okay?

10:17.759 --> 10:21.960
We must get down there to map out if
there are witnesses in that part.

10:22.039 --> 10:25.240
That'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I need to feed Anton.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.440
-Do you feed your husband?
-I wish. Anton is a cat.

10:29.519 --> 10:33.960
I just had him castrated,
so he's pouting a little lately.

10:34.279 --> 10:38.039
See you at the crime scene
tomorrow morning. Bye!

11:05.519 --> 11:07.919
Fish alarm!

11:08.360 --> 11:11.120
Here's the fish.

11:18.559 --> 11:20.679
It's super...

12:09.159 --> 12:11.200
Yes, Lars...

12:11.759 --> 12:16.519
If it was up to me, we would have
reinstated you immediately.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.759
But that's not happening?

12:18.840 --> 12:23.120
The new health professional
consultant is a stickler for rules.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.840
She insists on further evaluation
before granting your license.

12:26.919 --> 12:29.120
But let's not be negative.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.600
The department
got a new murder case.

12:31.679 --> 12:36.919
I persuaded the Chief of Police to
hire you as an external consultant.

12:37.679 --> 12:41.559
-External consultant?
-It is a new beginning, Lars.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.720
When you contribute
in the way we both know you can,-

12:45.799 --> 12:49.200
-it's a matter of time before
you're working full time again.

12:49.279 --> 12:52.960
What type of case
are we talking about?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.639
Woman found dead in subway tunnel

13:00.080 --> 13:03.000
-Have you heard from Alfhildr?
-No, why?

13:03.080 --> 13:06.759
I was supposed to meet her by the
tunnel at Tøyen. She never showed.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.960
-She's not picking up when I call.
-There's surely explanation.

13:11.039 --> 13:15.559
What if she went to follow up on
the case and something went wrong?

13:15.639 --> 13:17.960
Do you need help with something?

13:37.480 --> 13:40.679
-Alfhildr?
-What the fuck?

13:40.759 --> 13:43.440
Lars?
Knock down the door, will you?

13:53.519 --> 13:56.159
-Hi.
-What are you doing?

13:56.240 --> 13:59.600
The lock won't work.
I've been here since this morning.

13:59.679 --> 14:03.320
-That's not a full answer.
-Cut the small talk.

14:03.399 --> 14:09.159
I'm dying from thirst. There's water
in the can underneath the bench.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.519
The key has snapped.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.080
-You don't have pliers or something?
-At the petrol house.

14:27.159 --> 14:30.759
But first...
I need to piss.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.519
No, please.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.360
I'm a big girl, Lars.
I'm not pissing in the bed.

14:37.440 --> 14:41.480
There's a bucket in the loo.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.159
Yes...

14:46.440 --> 14:48.919
Roll down my panties.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.919
Good!

14:55.360 --> 14:57.600
-There.
-No, that's not working.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.759
You have to hold it.
It's coming.

15:12.679 --> 15:17.159
Sorry.
I'm aiming as good as I can.

15:22.799 --> 15:26.159
-Does that sound mean we're done?
-Yes.

15:27.759 --> 15:30.159
Thanks!

15:42.159 --> 15:45.360
Okay. Now,
can you tell me what the deal was?

15:47.759 --> 15:52.320
I've been struggling with
some kind of sleepwalking.

15:52.399 --> 15:56.399
-I wanted to film what's going on.
-Not the bucket session, I hope.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.399
If it was, I'll delete it.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.720
The images in my head
are harder to get rid of.

16:04.360 --> 16:07.200
Are you coming back to work?

16:07.279 --> 16:10.919
Yes, I'll be a consultant
on the knife murder.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.440
What's been going on with you?

16:14.519 --> 16:17.919
-Nothing in particular.
-Come on.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.600
I haven't heard from you
in several moons.

16:25.559 --> 16:29.720
Are you back on the drops?
What is it, then?

16:29.799 --> 16:33.440
-Are you still seeing visions?
-Okay, I have a suggestion.

16:33.519 --> 16:39.639
If you stop questioning me, I won't
mention that thing to the others.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.440
-Going straight back to lying again?
-It's true.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.879
What's it going to be? Are we going
to the station to confess our sins?

16:48.960 --> 16:53.039
Or shall I drop you off at
a locksmith? It's up to you.

16:57.519 --> 17:00.279
Take me to that goddamn locksmith.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.319
Fuck!

17:14.799 --> 17:19.079
-Busy today.
-Potential witnesses from the tunnel.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.799
-I heard you found Alfie?
-Yes, she'd just overslept.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.039
She's coming straight
to the appointment with Oddvar.

17:26.119 --> 17:29.160
-Had to freshen up a little.
-Freshen up?

17:29.240 --> 17:32.279
I didn't even know
the woman used soap.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.480
We can confirm that
the woman is from the 19th century.

17:41.559 --> 17:44.599
Geographical affiliation
is still unconfirmed.

17:44.680 --> 17:48.480
But hopefully a toxicology test
will give us a pointer.

17:48.559 --> 17:51.279
Did you get anything
from the knife wounds?

17:51.359 --> 17:56.640
The killer knows how to use a knife.
The cut on her throat is precise.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.519
The person also has
knowledge about anatomy.

17:59.599 --> 18:04.000
If you look at the genital area,
the clitoris has been removed.

18:04.079 --> 18:06.200
What's the clitoris?

18:06.279 --> 18:08.720
I guess someone
hasn't met Prince Charming yet.

18:08.799 --> 18:12.160
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean? Spit it out!

18:12.240 --> 18:15.440
-What is it?
-Well, Oddvar, you're the expert.

18:15.519 --> 18:18.359
I think you
should take this conversation.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.680
The clitoris is
a part of the female genitalia-

18:21.759 --> 18:24.759
-that gives pleasure
when stimulated.

18:24.839 --> 18:29.119
-You haven't heard of orgasms either?
-I know more than you, at least.

18:29.200 --> 18:34.240
Can we have the discussion about
who's had the most orgasms later?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.680
Thank you.

18:38.759 --> 18:41.680
If you look at the belly here...

19:04.599 --> 19:07.200
-Hello?
-Hi!

19:07.279 --> 19:10.839
-I need your help.
-Of course.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.759
Could you set up an appointment
with the sorceress you mentioned?

19:14.839 --> 19:18.200
-Yes, how come?
-I have to see her, tonight.

19:18.279 --> 19:22.319
-Today? That's short notice.
-Listen, Tore.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.559
I have this
sleeping thing that bothers me.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.400
-I have to get it fixed.
-I'll see what I can do.

19:48.720 --> 19:54.200
Attention: This is a reminder that
spitting, urinating or-

19:54.279 --> 19:58.319
-throwing rubbish indoors
is prohibited and will be fined.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.240
Are you who I think you are?

20:13.319 --> 20:16.519
I am Olaf Haraldsson.

20:16.599 --> 20:21.519
-Skitr. I dig your YouTube channel.
-I'm pleased to hear that.

20:21.599 --> 20:24.440
Can we take a group selfie?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.799
Not in here.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.640
These are the official colour codes
for establishing identity.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.599
Green identities are available.
Anyone can claim those.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.680
It continues like that up the scale.

20:51.759 --> 20:56.519
The identity you are trying to claim,
is the red one.

20:57.039 --> 21:01.079
Which means it potentially
offers considerable benefits.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.480
And it is therefore
strictly protected.

21:04.559 --> 21:07.799
I don't give a shit
about your colours.

21:07.880 --> 21:12.559
I am Olaf Haraldsson.
King of Norway.

21:12.640 --> 21:17.519
I'll put it plainly.
Your naming application was denied.

21:17.599 --> 21:21.799
But what about
the contemporary witnesses?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.119
My woman sent you a list.

21:24.200 --> 21:29.440
With many names that
can confirm that I am who I am.

21:29.519 --> 21:34.960
Most of the people on that list are
registered with zero memory level.

21:35.039 --> 21:38.319
We get that you have just
recruited some pipsqueaks online.

21:38.400 --> 21:43.640
-It's time to drop the act, okay?
-Now, you should tread carefully.

21:44.119 --> 21:49.759
A simple Saracen has no right to talk
to the greatest king of Norway-

21:49.839 --> 21:53.799
- in that manner.
-Saracen? Now I've heard that too.

21:54.160 --> 21:57.240
You have not only
misunderstood who I am.

21:57.319 --> 22:00.559
You have misunderstood what I am.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.759
What are you, then?

22:02.839 --> 22:08.440
The sword God uses
to punish his enemies.

22:09.480 --> 22:13.319
And I'm a case worker with
senior authority in naming cases.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.079
So, I guess we can agree
we're both real badasses.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.480
Ingrid!
Your dad is here.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.599
Sturla
Are you there?

22:55.279 --> 22:58.240
-Hi, dad!
-I just started.

22:58.319 --> 23:00.480
Okay...

23:06.440 --> 23:09.680
Something wrong?
You seem completely out of it.

23:09.759 --> 23:14.200
No. It's just been a little stressful
with the beginning of term and stuff.

23:14.279 --> 23:18.039
I see you started on that one.
I didn't manage to fix that.

23:18.119 --> 23:20.519
-Hi.
-Greetings.

23:40.359 --> 23:43.799
I don't mean to be rude,
but that's my milk.

23:48.839 --> 23:51.400
There's a whole page missing here.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.960
Hi.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.240
Hi. Lars Haaland.
I'm Ingrid's father.

23:59.319 --> 24:03.160
-Is Madeleine in her room?
-I think so.

24:07.759 --> 24:11.359
-Hey! How did it go?
-No.

24:12.559 --> 24:16.880
Without my name, I'm nothing.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.480
Listen. What if
I just tell the world how we met?

24:27.240 --> 24:30.839
-Then no one can doubt it.
-That won't work.

24:33.079 --> 24:38.119
The people in power now don't
like talking about stuff like that.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.720
You have to remember
that people in power-

24:40.799 --> 24:43.799
-are different here
than in the old times.

24:45.599 --> 24:49.799
The people in power
are the same in all times, sweetie.

24:52.079 --> 24:54.720
In all times.

25:29.039 --> 25:32.720
What the fuck?
Did you get a pet pig?

25:34.160 --> 25:38.079
-Something like that.
-I see.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.440
It's for autumn blót sacrifice.

25:40.519 --> 25:44.880
I'm just happy to have a job
and don't ask too many questions.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.079
You're not going to blab?

25:49.799 --> 25:53.039
I am not that much of a cop.
Is the volva ready?

25:53.759 --> 25:55.839
Yes.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.759
Greetings.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.640
The Hound tells me
you walk in your sleep.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.720
-That's right.
-How often?

26:37.799 --> 26:41.400
Normally there are weeks in between.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.319
But lately it's been more frequent.

26:44.880 --> 26:49.799
Do you think I have
the temporal sleeping disease-

26:49.880 --> 26:53.119
-or whatever it's called?

27:02.559 --> 27:04.880
You don't have that.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.880
Are you sure?

27:09.400 --> 27:12.480
The sleep sick
have death in their eyes.

27:13.359 --> 27:16.119
While yours are glimmering.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.119
There must be
other powers loose in you.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.599
What powers?

27:22.680 --> 27:25.359
That's what we're going to find out.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.640
Do you need blood?

27:32.720 --> 27:36.720
No.
Spit will do.

27:48.759 --> 27:51.640
I see a girl from the sea.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.839
She is wearing a luminous vest.

27:56.519 --> 27:59.680
Where does
this strange girl come from?

28:04.680 --> 28:06.960
Wait.

28:07.039 --> 28:09.759
What has Tore said?

28:09.839 --> 28:13.440
Don't break the vision.
I can feel something.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.279
-Stop.
-Let me feel inside you.

28:17.359 --> 28:21.319
Are you deaf?
I said stop.

28:35.119 --> 28:38.000
-Finished already?
-You promised not to tell anyone-

28:38.079 --> 28:42.279
-about the life jacket memory.
That memory must have been false.

28:42.359 --> 28:46.880
-I haven't told anyone.
-So how does the volva know?

28:49.799 --> 28:51.799
She's proably had a vision.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.160
If it was a true vision,
she would've seen with my eyes.

28:55.240 --> 28:59.720
Her words were from another gaze.
That means you've talked.

28:59.799 --> 29:03.559
I didn't talk, okay?

29:04.119 --> 29:07.000
There must be another explanation.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.880
Kurukhés?

29:49.920 --> 29:52.920
-Good?
-Yes. Did you get the medicine?

29:54.160 --> 29:57.279
-I had forgetness.
-Okay...

29:57.359 --> 30:00.359
It's just that I'm all out, you see.

30:00.440 --> 30:04.640
I take fix.
I take fix tomorrow.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.839
Thank you.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.880
Good morning, Lars.
Can I help you?

31:50.960 --> 31:55.960
There is a knife murder in England
that we need classified info about.

31:56.039 --> 32:00.680
It's a possible link to our case.
Who should I contact?

32:00.759 --> 32:06.000
Just send it to me. I'll forward the
request to our English colleagues.

32:08.480 --> 32:12.799
We're going to have to do
this consultation nice and slow.

32:12.880 --> 32:17.000
Our colleague unfortunately fell
into a bucket of mead last night.

32:17.079 --> 32:21.599
-Did you stay out late?
-Do you see what I have to deal with?

32:22.440 --> 32:26.599
Where are we on CCTV from the
area around the Tunnel of Tears?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.960
It's not looking too promising.

32:29.039 --> 32:31.799
No footage from
one of Oslo's most central areas?

32:31.880 --> 32:34.720
There was a power outage in the
server park where files are uploaded.

32:34.799 --> 32:37.279
But I'll try to recover it.

32:37.359 --> 32:42.319
Did you ask to contact Scotland Yard
about a possible serial killer?

32:42.400 --> 32:47.240
Yes, I came across a murder
in London with several similarities.

32:47.319 --> 32:50.799
With such a brutal disfigurement
of the victim, we should...

32:50.880 --> 32:54.920
You can't suggest a serial killer to
another country's police authority-

32:55.000 --> 32:57.839
-without first conferring
with Alfie and me.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.160
You're an external consultant.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.720
We're the ones left with the crap
if this is cry wolf.

33:02.799 --> 33:05.160
Wenche's got a point.

33:05.240 --> 33:09.720
It would have been better
to run it by us first.

33:15.160 --> 33:20.480
Are you also filled with envy when
you look at this warrior?

33:23.799 --> 33:26.640
Can't say that I am.

33:26.720 --> 33:32.160
Rather my head on a stick, than a
life without honour.

33:32.240 --> 33:36.440
Excuse me. You don't happen
to know where the souvenir shop is?

33:36.519 --> 33:41.319
We're not guides.
We're real vikings. Get lost.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.839
Who's the guy?
Anyone we know?

33:55.599 --> 33:58.880
It's apparently not a man,
but a woman.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.880
-What?
-A woman?

34:06.440 --> 34:09.280
How do the present-timers know that?

34:09.360 --> 34:13.760
Do they have her cunt
on display somewhere as well?

34:13.840 --> 34:16.800
They don't need her cunt.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.880
They figure out all kinds
of things from the bones.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.960
It's something called DNA.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.760
DNA?

34:31.239 --> 34:37.360
Can the present-timers
find kinship in the bones as well?

34:39.480 --> 34:42.679
That's my impression.

34:44.199 --> 34:47.280
-What the hell...
-What?

34:47.719 --> 34:51.960
Why haven't you told me this before?

34:53.440 --> 34:56.400
This is the answer.

34:57.239 --> 34:59.599
What answer?

35:00.119 --> 35:03.559
My son...
King Magnus.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.719
I know where he's buried.

35:10.760 --> 35:15.519
Listen!
Judgement day has arrived!

35:16.000 --> 35:19.719
We are the children God forgot!

35:19.800 --> 35:24.480
There is no use in seeking shelter,
because the storm...

35:55.599 --> 35:58.159
Could you run by the bakery?

35:58.239 --> 36:02.480
It looks like we'll be having
some important visitors.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.639
-Mr Eriksen, I assume?
-Great to meet you.

36:30.719 --> 36:33.679
-This is Mr Rubinstein.
-Welcome.

36:40.039 --> 36:43.440
-Scones? Tea?
-No, thank you.

36:43.519 --> 36:45.679
No, thank you.

36:46.199 --> 36:50.239
Okay, let's...
When you're ready, please.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.599
I am Precious Clark,
Chief Investigative Officer-

36:54.679 --> 36:56.760
- in the
London Metropolitian Police Service.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.679
And this is
special consultant mister Rubinstein.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.679
I would like to begin
by commending you for flagging us.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.440
It must have taken a keen
investigative mind to see the links-

37:08.519 --> 37:12.599
-between our cases.
My compliments to you, Mr Eriksen.

37:13.679 --> 37:17.440
Well, it was more of a team effort.

37:17.519 --> 37:20.440
Good.
Well, let's get down to business.

37:20.519 --> 37:24.880
Last summer, there was an
unregistered arrival near Brighton.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.400
A timeigrant presumed
to have 19th century origin.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.360
Resisted entering the arrival program
by threatening a local harbor gurad.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.519
With a razorlike object.

37:34.599 --> 37:38.599
A warrant was issued on him,
but he was never apprehended.

37:38.679 --> 37:43.639
When this woman was found in
an East End massage parlor-

37:43.719 --> 37:48.639
-a few months later, we connected the
murder to the undetected arrival.

37:48.719 --> 37:52.280
You see, the killer's modus operandi-

37:52.360 --> 37:57.239
-has striking similarities to
a case from my time of origin.

37:58.039 --> 38:02.559
-What case was that?
-The so-called Whitechapel Murders.

38:05.920 --> 38:10.280
Are you saying that
Jack the Ripper has timeigrated?

38:10.639 --> 38:13.320
That's our primary hypothesis, yes.

38:14.199 --> 38:18.639
And now you believe that
Jack the Ripper is here, in Oslo?

38:18.719 --> 38:21.840
-That remains for her to tell us.
-Her?

38:23.119 --> 38:25.480
The victim.

38:33.119 --> 38:36.639
Do you have any suggested research
on the original Ripper case?

38:44.079 --> 38:46.559
This is where you should start.

38:47.920 --> 38:52.800
Okay. How is this
relevant to the investigation?

38:52.880 --> 38:56.280
Relevance comes in many disguises.

38:59.960 --> 39:05.079
I didn't want to seem like an idiot,
but my English is not that great.

39:06.039 --> 39:09.440
Who the fuck is "Check Dripper"?

39:11.519 --> 39:14.119
I'll try to explain on the way.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.840
My original report was in Norwegian.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.239
But we are having
it translated as we speak.

39:30.239 --> 39:32.840
-To sum up my main findings, I...
-Please.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.360
Be quiet while I examine her.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.000
What do you think?

39:56.599 --> 39:59.840
He is here.
No doubt about it.

40:11.280 --> 40:17.000
A bit more in the corner, maybe.
It's going to be so great.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.800
-Are you going out?
-Yes. We're meeting Olav's guys.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.000
-Wanna join?
-I think I'll have a quiet evening.

40:25.079 --> 40:28.400
I heard a certain
weather presenter is joining in.

40:28.480 --> 40:33.199
-All the more reason not to join.
-What..? Was it that bad?

40:33.280 --> 40:37.199
No. I didn't mean it like that.
I'm just tired.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.280
-That's fine. That's allowed.
-Have fun.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.360
Thanks.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.639
That's completely fine.
Okay.

41:49.519 --> 41:54.239
You may put on a nice shirt
and pretend to be normal.

41:55.239 --> 41:57.920
But it doesn't change anything.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.960
-Who are you?
-You know very well, Lars.

42:07.519 --> 42:10.239
-No...
-My assistant told me-

42:10.320 --> 42:13.039
-you can be slow sometimes.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.360
I'm not quite following.

42:18.440 --> 42:23.400
That bearded guy you've been
talking to at night, works for me.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.280
I am Odin.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.760
-Odin the god?
-Bingo.

42:36.480 --> 42:42.199
Okay. I obviously need to get
more of that medicine. Goodnight.

42:52.760 --> 42:56.880
I decide when the night begins
and when it ends.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.079
The fire that burns.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.159
The sacred fire that burns.

43:23.239 --> 43:26.840
The sacred red flame.

43:27.440 --> 43:31.320
Let it be our lodestar.

43:32.960 --> 43:39.159
O noble Gods and loving Goddesses!

43:40.480 --> 43:43.679
Need is burning.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.639
Need lives.

43:47.039 --> 43:50.679
Pure in its clarity.

43:52.320 --> 43:55.960
Pure against the darkness.

44:11.960 --> 44:16.800
Mr Eriksen told me you could assist
me in printing some case files.

44:16.880 --> 44:21.840
Need is burning.
Need lives.

44:21.920 --> 44:27.159
Need lives.
Need is burning.

44:28.079 --> 44:32.519
Need lives.
Need is burning.

44:33.760 --> 44:37.760
Need lives.
Need is burning.

44:38.880 --> 44:44.360
The fire that burns,
the sacred red flame.

44:44.719 --> 44:48.199
Let it be our lodestar.

44:49.760 --> 44:54.960
O noble Gods and loving Goddesses!

44:56.000 --> 45:00.119
Need lives...

45:34.360 --> 45:36.840
You found her file?
