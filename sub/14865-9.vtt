WEBVTT

01:59.787 --> 02:01.994
Wake up.

02:03.249 --> 02:06.161
Wake up, sleepyhead.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.814
Be quiet, woman.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.760
Posca.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.015
Lucius Vorenus.

03:51.607 --> 03:55.191
Your monthly debauch is finished already?

03:55.319 --> 03:56.980
| see yours isn't.

03:57.113 --> 04:00.230
This? This is nothing.

04:00.366 --> 04:03.403
This is for my nerves.

04:03.536 --> 04:06.198
— Where is he?
— Where is he?

04:07.039 --> 04:09.701
A deep question.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.120
His mortal flesh is in the throne room

04:12.253 --> 04:14.665
meeting the delegation from the Senate.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.209
— They're here already?
— Yes.

04:17.341 --> 04:22.961
Senator Bibulus and several other
distinguished men whose names I forget

04:23.097 --> 04:24.257
arrived this morning.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.472
And why are you not in there?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.012
I value my life, such as it is.

04:30.396 --> 04:34.605
When the queen growls at me, | retreat.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.863
It's not cowardice.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.901
Who would look after my wife?

04:51.667 --> 04:56.377
You lead the animal on slightly. You see?

04:56.505 --> 04:58.962
Depending on how fast he's going.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.379
Drink the water.

05:05.097 --> 05:10.808
Now here's the moment.
The animal thinks only of his thirst.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.801
He knows there is danger.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.101
But he cannot resist the water.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.658
Easy, you see.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.917
My turn.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.085
Antony, if we might discuss
the matter at hand?

05:41.175 --> 05:44.008
You'll scare off the deer.

05:51.936 --> 05:56.305
— He moved. The beast moved!
- Again.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.102
Regarding the grain supply...

05:59.235 --> 06:03.444
l have been authorised to offer you
double the previous price,

06:03.572 --> 06:06.359
if you can guarantee delivery
before the end of the month.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.278
Double, you say?

06:09.828 --> 06:10.988
That's not bad.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.167
— Triple.
— Agreed.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.629
We will pay triple the correct price.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.008
And Carthage.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.969
Carthage will be annexed to Antony's control.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.382
That may be possible.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.475
Poor Octavian.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.890
He must be really desperate.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.311
People are starving, dying.

06:42.861 --> 06:46.274
Octavian will do what he must
to prevent further suffering.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.898
Because he loves the people so.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.322
- He does.
— He loves nobody and nobody loves him.

06:52.454 --> 06:57.539
He could feed the people larks
and oysters till they burst,

06:58.335 --> 07:00.417
and they would still love me more.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.377
Isn't that right, Vorenus?

07:02.506 --> 07:04.667
Yes, sir.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.257
There we are. The voice of the people.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.093
They love me.

07:10.222 --> 07:15.182
l have no doubt you are right,
but we do have an agreement, yes?

07:15.311 --> 07:16.972
Yes.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.391
Triple rates...

07:21.275 --> 07:22.936
and Carthage.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.392
— And Spain.
— Spain?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.033
You can't have Spain.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.694
That's a shame. No deal, then.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.448
— Really, this is absolutely...
— No deal.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.460
Brava, my love!

07:43.589 --> 07:44.999
Venison for dinner, then?

07:50.638 --> 07:52.924
Pleasant voyage home, boys.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.777
Get him out of here.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.862
I'll show you to your quarters.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.573
— Is he always like that?
— Like what?

08:18.123 --> 08:21.991
Well, if that doesn't make
the little shit declare war,

08:22.127 --> 08:24.163
I don't know what will.

08:25.798 --> 08:28.084
He's a cautious beast.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.976
Perhaps you should simply cut the cord

08:41.105 --> 08:43.812
and declare war yourself.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.772
Declare war...

08:47.152 --> 08:49.017
on Octavian?

08:49.905 --> 08:53.693
On my most trusted and beloved colleague?

08:53.826 --> 08:57.159
On Rome? On my own people? No, no, no.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.321
No, that wouldn't do.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.871
When I return home,

09:05.003 --> 09:08.336
it will be as a saviour,
not as a conqueror.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.386
I'm very tired.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.178
Oh, Helios.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.898
Selene, off with you. Off with you.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.688
Can't you see your father needs to sleep?

10:18.410 --> 10:20.901
Where are you going? Stay.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.994
You can hear them.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.625
What are you gonna do?
Bake 'em a cake?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.460
Oh, Dis.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.922
I forget sometimes
what a cold—hearted bitch you really are.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.005
Would you have me any other way?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.057
Are you joking?

10:41.183 --> 10:43.845
Anyone offers me a good horse
with the leathers thrown in...

10:44.812 --> 10:46.848
..you're gone.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.330
Back! Back!

11:10.462 --> 11:12.794
Keep out of the way!
Get out of the way!

11:22.474 --> 11:24.385
Let me through.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.510
Get out the way!

11:28.605 --> 11:30.266
Clear the way.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.144
Grain! Grain! Grain! Grain!

11:40.367 --> 11:43.325
- Please!
— My father is starving.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.490
Please! My father...

12:02.806 --> 12:05.047
Silence.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.178
Silence!

12:08.520 --> 12:10.511
The day's ration has been given.

12:12.691 --> 12:16.684
There'll be no more until tomorrow
at the appointed time.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.186
No!

12:23.368 --> 12:26.405
I know you're hungry.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.369
But you're alive.

12:28.498 --> 12:32.036
If I do as you ask and open the granaries,

12:32.169 --> 12:35.536
you'll be well fed today and starving tomorrow.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.510
Go home.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.553
Go home and suffer what
the Earth Mother has sent us.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.721
And come back tomorrow.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.435
Right.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.033
Still in one piece, then?
Thought they might have ate you.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.830
Too much gristle on the bone.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.500
Lucius, girls, I thought I told you to wait inside.

13:18.632 --> 13:22.090
I'll not cower when there's blood to be spilled.
Where's the honour in that?

13:22.219 --> 13:24.380
When you have hair on your chin
you can talk of blood.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.845
Vorena, I expected better.
Next time do as you're told.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.135
They're just hungry people.
They'd not hurt us.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.428
Hungry people do strange things.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.552
Then blessed Orbona will protect us.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.645
Well, run along and ask her
to send a grain ship.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.765
Me and Mascius have to talk.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.480
You too, Lucius.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.773
Go learn to read or something.

13:51.373 --> 13:55.036
- What's the tally?
— Ten days left, a quarter ration, give or take.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.250
- Gods below.
— lt's hardly worth giving out.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.290
Just prolonging the misery.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.966
Morning.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.834
The bakers' guild man was round earlier.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.177
I told you not to speak to them.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.806
Nor did I.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.719
He spoke, I said nothing.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.717
They're offering 600 a sack.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.435
600?

14:15.564 --> 14:17.646
Yeah, 600 and a few dead children

14:17.774 --> 14:20.982
for every sack that doesn't get
to the people that need them.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.232
We're not in this for profit.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.150
Still, it's 600.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.399
I piss on the bakers' guild.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.659
— Your call.
— Yes, it is.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.578
Why are you wasting
valuable food on him still?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.702
Let the poor bastard die.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.203
Memmio?

14:43.008 --> 14:46.000
No. He reminds the other men to stay honest.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.047
What's to be done, then?

14:50.057 --> 14:53.595
Fetch my best clothes.
I'll see if his honour has any ideas.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.812
Hey!

15:00.442 --> 15:02.478
Quiet, you.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.529
You fucking hairy bastard.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.741
So far it's just the old
and the sick that are dying.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.080
But by next moon, our granaries will be empty.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.542
I understand that dogs make good eating.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.206
They do.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.923
Taste like pork if you cook 'em right.
All gone.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.759
I wondered why the nights were so peaceful.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.755
- No barking.
— This is no moment for wit.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.303
| wish there were something I could do.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.676
But the state granaries
are near as empty as yours.

15:37.813 --> 15:41.055
I can only give to you
by taking from someone else.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.228
— The military silos are untapped.
- And the army needs to eat.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.860
Well, then, send three legions to Africa.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.694
Let Lepidus feed them.

15:48.824 --> 15:52.408
That would supply the city
with enough grain for a month.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.614
Have it done.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.910
It's only a temporary solution,
but it's the best we can offer.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.000
— I'll send you what we can spare.
— Thank you.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.544
Pullo.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.258
Tell me what the people are saying.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.878
Tell me who they blame for this famine.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.388
You, they say.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.978
— You're the man in charge.
— Not Antony?

16:22.399 --> 16:24.139
They hear the newsreaders saying

16:24.276 --> 16:27.860
that he's holding back
the shipments and all that, but...

16:27.988 --> 16:29.944
well, it's Antony, innit?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.114
Why would he starve them?

16:33.243 --> 16:36.406
They've always loved him
and he's always loved to be loved.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.529
Whereas you...

16:39.666 --> 16:42.328
Well, you're you, aren't you?

16:42.460 --> 16:43.996
Cold and heartless?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.461
I'll not say that.

16:49.134 --> 16:52.626
But you've never been
the affectionate type now, have you?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.637
Thank you, Pullo.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.810
— I'll be hearing about the grain, then, will I?
- Agrippa will see to it.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.811
— Perhaps Bibulus will succeed?
— No, he won't.

17:10.947 --> 17:14.235
Antony's not entirely irrational.
Given enough money, why should he refuse?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.028
Antony's not motivated by money.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.823
He hopes the people will rise up
in anger and depose me.

17:19.789 --> 17:23.532
Either that, or he simply wishes
to provoke me into declaring war on him.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.044
Has he really become so foolish?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.707
Who knows what he's become
after all these years out there?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.421
Who knows what Cleopatra whispers to him?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.381
He was always a fool for his women.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.297
If he wants a war, why not give it to him?

17:35.430 --> 17:36.931
You heard Pullo.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.719
You might as well declare war
on wine and song.

17:41.853 --> 17:42.808
No,no,no,no.

17:42.938 --> 17:47.227
War on Antony is doomed
unless the people are with us.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.645
Send for my mother and sister.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.190
I shall have dinner with them this evening.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.526
Grandma?

18:00.372 --> 18:02.363
You shouldn't be here.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.120
lt's dangerous.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.619
Antonia, where are you?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.996
She's up here with me. I'll bring her down.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.384
You naughty girl.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.718
What have I told you about going on the roof?

18:19.391 --> 18:22.383
I swear on Diana,
I shall have someone beat her.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.760
She doesn't listen to a word I say.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.763
She's a good girl, really.
Just like you were at that age.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.685
And I turned out so well?

18:29.818 --> 18:32.776
Your brother, on the other hand,
was as biddable as a shepherd's dog.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.565
No trouble at all.

18:34.698 --> 18:37.030
Castor, are there any letters for me today?

18:37.158 --> 18:38.773
No, Domina.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.151
Strange.

18:41.288 --> 18:45.076
I had the strongest feeling
that today was the day.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.950
Mother? There will be no letter.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.667
You're wrong.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.755
Sorry to be blunt, but...

18:54.134 --> 18:56.546
Well, don't you think it's time to face facts?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.464
Antony promised to send for me and he will.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.973
Even if he did, do you think
Octavian would let you go?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.930
I don't give a fig.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.348
Truly, is he worth torturing yourself like this?

19:08.773 --> 19:12.937
Domina? Octavian Caesar summons you both
for dinner this evening.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.653
What does he want now, I wonder?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.817
Nothing to our benefit.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.156
Family and friends.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.291
Nothing better.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.713
Octavia, l have a favour to ask of you.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.431
You are aware of the grain shortage,
lsuppose?

19:44.559 --> 19:47.676
You know that the people are
dying in the streets for want of bread?

19:49.314 --> 19:51.020
And you want me to feed them?

19:51.775 --> 19:53.891
In a manner of speaking.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.188
Your husband has plenty of grain in Egypt.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.233
But he is playing politics with it, holding it back.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.984
If you were to go and talk to him...

20:04.496 --> 20:07.704
|? Go to Egypt?

20:07.832 --> 20:10.744
The soft voice of a loving wife

20:10.877 --> 20:13.289
may succeed where all else has failed.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.581
You are joking?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.922
I cannot remember the last time I made a joke.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.632
Last market day.

20:19.761 --> 20:22.753
You said something about fishes
which made me laugh quite distinctly.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.050
l was speaking figuratively.

20:28.436 --> 20:34.102
If you are serious, it is not I should go,
but Mother. She's his real wife.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.189
I thought you might go together.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.359
Present Antony with both
reality and appearance.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.409
That's all very well, but...

20:47.539 --> 20:50.952
l have no desire to take a long sea voyage.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.746
— Do you?
- No.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.459
Besides, we're not hungry.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.579
And we need no grain.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.170
So what's in it for us?

21:01.302 --> 21:05.887
How will you pay us for our trouble?

21:06.015 --> 21:08.301
What do you want?

21:12.522 --> 21:15.104
Pompeii's become vulgar.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.940
I'd like a villa in Capri.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.730
That's fine.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.730
What about you, Octavia? Do you want a villa?

21:25.201 --> 21:26.941
I don't know.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.739
A villa would be nice.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.530
Some gladiators would be fun as well.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.624
Why not take cash and decide later?

21:34.752 --> 21:38.165
— Good idea. Cash.
— As you wish.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.499
Maecenas, have the newsreader announce
they are leaving as soon as possible.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.157
I like birds.

23:01.506 --> 23:04.669
I don't like eggs.
There is something quite sordid about eggs.

23:05.468 --> 23:09.211
We shan't serve them any more.
Unless you object, of course.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.686
Why are you sending
Atia and Octavia to Egypt?

23:20.692 --> 23:24.435
- You heard why.
— Well, yes, but that can't be the real reason.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.062
You know Antony will refuse what they ask.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.699
It's very likely.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.114
What?

23:34.247 --> 23:38.365
You calculate...that if Antony
turns Octavia away,

23:38.501 --> 23:42.414
the people will feel that he has
publicly humiliated his darling wife,

23:42.547 --> 23:45.038
that Queen Cleopatra has bewitched him,

23:45.174 --> 23:47.005
and they will all turn against him.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.876
Something like that.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.015
But on the other hand,

23:53.141 --> 23:56.429
if Antony still loves Atia
and yields to her pleading,

23:56.561 --> 23:59.769
then...so much the better.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.853
You'll have your grain.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.266
Clever boy.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.689
Good night, my dear.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.296
| wish you'd stop that.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.845
We'll get there no faster.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.104
Have I changed at all, do you think,
since he last saw me?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.563
No. You're just exactly as you were.

24:48.363 --> 24:51.321
He'll fall into your arms in a delirium of love.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.280
Do you mean that?

24:53.409 --> 24:54.660
No.

24:56.120 --> 25:00.284
You've become very mean, you know.
Mean and bitter.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.953
You've become girlish and sentimental.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.456
lt's disgusting, frankly.

25:25.817 --> 25:29.025
No points. No points.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.314
I wasn't ready.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.361
Ten points to me.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.450
Well done, Majesty. Well done.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.035
— Ready?
— No, wait!

25:40.164 --> 25:42.576
I beg thee! Wait!

25:44.252 --> 25:47.085
Useless old woman. Go away.

25:58.558 --> 26:01.766
Vorenus, play with me.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.810
Throw it properly.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.229
Come on, then.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.622
Good catch.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.913
Tell me more about my father.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.751
I told you all that I know.

26:29.881 --> 26:33.669
You've told me only what every fool knows.

26:33.801 --> 26:38.261
He was a great soldier,
the people loved him, blah blah blah.

26:39.056 --> 26:42.139
Tell me what he was like as a man.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.851
Well, he was...

26:45.980 --> 26:48.096
he was a good man.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.894
He was a good man to have as a friend.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.938
You wouldn't want him as an enemy.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.857
He had a nasty temper when he was roused.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.447
When the battle was going hard
and men were faltering,

26:58.576 --> 27:02.068
that's when you'd want to see
your father at your side.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.283
Bravest man I've ever known.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.417
More.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.082
Fine horseman.

27:12.215 --> 27:15.378
Bad gambler, though he'd never admit it.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.171
He liked the women.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.259
He liked to eat.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.300
He'd eat the whole table if you'd let him.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.809
Really?

27:23.935 --> 27:27.678
I've always heard he was very...
abstemious in his diet.

27:27.814 --> 27:31.022
Yeah, well, that would be right.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.108
There's others knew him far better than I did.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.490
— Where are they?
- What's wrong?

27:47.041 --> 27:48.872
What do you mean, here?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.162
Their ship docked an hour ago.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.456
They're on their way to the palace now.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.671
And they request an immediate
audience with you!

27:55.800 --> 27:57.165
How delicious.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.633
Wife and lover come together to see you.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.128
Hush, woman.

28:03.516 --> 28:06.132
— What do they want?
- I don't know.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.427
What shall I tell them? They will be here.

28:09.564 --> 28:12.146
Just, give...give...

28:12.275 --> 28:14.140
give me time to think.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.858
No.

28:18.072 --> 28:21.530
They would not have come of their own accord.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.117
Octavian must have sent them here.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.782
Sent them to do what?

28:26.914 --> 28:29.872
Why else send my wife

28:30.001 --> 28:33.243
except to effect some kind of...

28:33.379 --> 28:34.710
reconciliation.

28:34.839 --> 28:37.797
— Well, you must refuse her.
— Obviously, yes.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.136
But that...

28:41.262 --> 28:45.471
that is exactly what he wants.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.886
He is forcing me to choose publicly

28:48.019 --> 28:51.853
between her and...and you.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.438
And when I turn her away, which I will,

28:55.860 --> 28:57.896
he will have his premise for war.

28:58.029 --> 29:00.020
Then why so glum?

29:01.365 --> 29:04.152
You have what you wanted.
A war that he will start,

29:04.285 --> 29:06.116
a war that you did not seek.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.861
And still...

29:08.998 --> 29:11.239
I do not like it.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.081
He is...

29:13.210 --> 29:15.792
he is striking

29:15.922 --> 29:18.208
at my support amongst the people.

29:18.341 --> 29:21.754
He...he will think he has outmanoeuvred me.

29:21.886 --> 29:25.219
What matter?
As long as you win the war.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.722
Yes.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.388
— I suppose so.
— In any case...

29:32.772 --> 29:36.060
we must be gracious hosts, ne?

29:36.192 --> 29:38.308
We shall throw a lovely party for them.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.232
Charmian, send for the kitchen chamberlain.

29:42.365 --> 29:43.946
No, no, no. No!

29:44.075 --> 29:47.238
No? We must be hospitable.

29:51.916 --> 29:54.248
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

29:57.755 --> 30:00.588
Humiliating Atia.

30:01.926 --> 30:06.545
Watching her squirm as you play the queen.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.847
Play the queen?

30:09.976 --> 30:11.591
lam a queen.

30:12.436 --> 30:17.271
— You know what I mean.
— No. No, ldon't.

30:17.942 --> 30:22.936
You...you just want
to flaunt our love in front of her.

30:23.072 --> 30:26.940
Why not? We love each other, don't we?

30:28.786 --> 30:30.617
And you no longer love her.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.953
Why should she not know it?

30:39.755 --> 30:41.711
It's an act of kindness.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.877
Stop her pining for you.

30:46.637 --> 30:50.676
I'm not wrong, am |?
You do no longer love her.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.969
Of course I no longer love her.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.475
And you know I no longer love her.

31:00.443 --> 31:03.981
But neither do I think
she deserves public humiliation.

31:05.322 --> 31:08.450
That is the whole point.

31:08.576 --> 31:11.989
That is why they're here, to be humiliated.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.323
No, I don't think she knows that.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.371
Else she would not be here.

31:20.963 --> 31:25.047
I think her fucking son

31:25.176 --> 31:27.633
has manipulated her into it.

31:31.057 --> 31:33.343
Let's kill them, then.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.849
What? What did you say?

31:41.358 --> 31:44.065
Atia will not be humiliated...

31:44.195 --> 31:46.231
because Atia will be dead.

31:50.910 --> 31:55.370
Octavian will know that you're not a man
to be outmanoeuvred.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.534
It's perfect.

32:02.546 --> 32:06.084
No. My people will despise me as a wife—killer.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.626
Well, their ship sank on the way home.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.377
— No.
— It happens all the time.

32:11.514 --> 32:13.596
No. I mean it. No!

32:13.724 --> 32:17.683
| see. Well, either you are a coward...

32:19.563 --> 32:21.724
or you still have feelings for her.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.973
Which is it?

32:25.736 --> 32:27.897
Which is it?

32:28.030 --> 32:30.316
Why don't you shut your fucking mouth?

32:41.168 --> 32:42.408
Oh, you...

33:18.998 --> 33:21.284
Gods, what a ghastly place.

33:22.543 --> 33:24.499
Big, though.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.789
It's a sure sign of vulgarity.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.964
Ptolemies were originally goatherds,
you know?

33:38.809 --> 33:40.549
Why are the doors not open?

33:52.031 --> 33:53.191
Enough!

33:53.699 --> 33:55.155
No!

34:02.499 --> 34:05.866
This is outrageous.

34:06.003 --> 34:07.959
The rudeness.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.374
It just goes to show...vulgar.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.293
Royalty, indeed.

34:12.426 --> 34:14.257
This heat's unbearable.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.877
I think I'm going to faint.

34:17.014 --> 34:19.130
You would think they would bring us water.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.348
— Can't we go back to the ship?
- Absolutely not.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.843
We're staying here
until these wretched people...

34:23.979 --> 34:26.846
Oh, and about bloody time.

34:28.359 --> 34:29.348
Hello.

34:29.485 --> 34:32.067
Jocasta. Is it you?

34:32.196 --> 34:33.902
Of course it's me. Who else would I be?

34:34.031 --> 34:35.111
What's happened to you?

34:35.241 --> 34:39.029
This? Her Majesty doesn't like
the Roman style on her women.

34:39.161 --> 34:42.574
Quite irrational about the subject if you ask me.

34:42.706 --> 34:46.119
But anything for a quiet life.
I rather like it now.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.584
What are you doing here?
Have you come for Crocodile Day?

34:48.712 --> 34:51.920
That's what I call it, anyway.
I can't get my mouth round their lingo.

34:52.049 --> 34:53.789
She will shriek.

34:53.926 --> 34:57.089
But ljust pretend I'm a little mad,
and she leaves off.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.883
Why is the door kept shut?
Why is there no one here to greet us?

35:00.015 --> 35:02.802
Oh, I'm sure there'll be
someone along in a while.

35:02.935 --> 35:07.520
Things move...ever so slow around here.
It's the heat.

35:07.648 --> 35:11.311
Listen, why don't you go inside
and tell Antony that we're waiting to see him?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.650
Obviously, he's not been
informed that we're here.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.485
I couldn't do that.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.606
No one's allowed to speak
to Antony without she says so.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.278
Except my dear little Posca.

35:20.411 --> 35:22.572
And Lucius Vorenus, of course.

35:22.705 --> 35:24.320
I love your hair like that.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.708
Is that how people are wearing it now?

35:26.834 --> 35:29.120
Thank Juno. Posca.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.290
— What in heaven's name is...
— Jocasta, what are you doing?

35:32.423 --> 35:34.288
— l was only...
- Quiet, woman!

35:34.425 --> 35:35.665
Posca, where's Antony?

35:35.801 --> 35:38.838
Yes, yes! A great pleasure.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.836
Indeed, yes. Come along.

35:43.434 --> 35:46.426
Posca? Posca?

35:47.938 --> 35:49.599
Thank you.

35:52.943 --> 35:56.231
They've all gone insane, obviously.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.110
So hot.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.667
It's for the best, you know.

37:02.846 --> 37:06.009
This palace life is no good for you.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.099
You need action.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.310
Yeah.

37:11.438 --> 37:14.350
You'll be much more happy
when the war begins.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.106
— Vorenus.
— Sir?

37:22.908 --> 37:25.570
l have a delicate mission for you.

37:37.714 --> 37:41.127
I'm glad to see you
haven't gone native, at least.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.546
Perhaps you can talk some sense.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.260
What is the matter with these people?

37:45.389 --> 37:48.005
Why hasn't Antony been told of our arrival?

37:49.560 --> 37:52.893
I've been ordered by Triumvir Mark Antony
to escort you both back to your ship,

37:53.021 --> 37:56.889
and to make sure that you leave Alexandria
as soon as the wind allows.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.773
Without seeing him?

38:08.662 --> 38:11.574
He turns away the mother of his child?

38:12.958 --> 38:15.040
That's correct.

38:15.169 --> 38:19.208
It was she who ordered you to do this,
wasn't it?

38:19.339 --> 38:20.954
Antony wouldn't act so low.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.582
I take orders only from Mark Antony, madam.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.640
No, we're not going.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.475
— Mother, I...
- Madam...

38:34.605 --> 38:36.971
We are not going.

38:37.107 --> 38:39.189
I am not moving from this spot

38:39.318 --> 38:42.355
unless Antony comes down
himself and tells me to go.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.900
If you will not go willingly,
l have been given orders

38:45.032 --> 38:47.648
to use whatever force
necessary to remove you.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.649
You would manhandle the women of the Julii?

38:49.786 --> 38:52.573
No, but these men here...

38:53.790 --> 38:55.075
they have no such scruples.

39:04.468 --> 39:05.503
— Antony!
— Madam.

39:05.636 --> 39:06.842
Come down, you bastard!

39:06.970 --> 39:08.710
Madam, please!

39:35.624 --> 39:39.583
You tell my husband that he's cowardly scum.

39:40.671 --> 39:42.332
Tell him that.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.358
You realise, of course,
we'll have to leave all our money behind.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.230
- I don't care!
— We're penniless.

40:10.367 --> 40:14.531
I'm scared. I want to go home. Please, hurry.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.409
— Going somewhere?
— No.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.873
No. What makes you think that?

40:22.671 --> 40:24.411
Please, Vorenus.

40:24.548 --> 40:26.880
Don't tell. Please don't tell.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.545
Have mercy on us.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.669
They'll kill us.
They'll throw us to the crocodiles.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.921
My wife is ovenNrought.

40:34.057 --> 40:37.265
We were merely going to take
a stroll along the harbour

40:37.394 --> 40:39.225
to look at the ships.

40:41.148 --> 40:44.311
Then you must hurry.

40:44.443 --> 40:47.355
The wind is changing.
The ships look best when the sails are set.

40:48.614 --> 40:50.605
Come with us.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.700
— No.
— War is sure to come now.

40:55.829 --> 40:58.366
This is no place for decent Romans.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.705
True, but I have responsibilities here.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.574
Now is the time.

41:07.257 --> 41:10.590
If you happen to see Titus Pullo,

41:10.719 --> 41:12.835
ask him to kiss my children for me.

41:13.764 --> 41:14.924
I will do that.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.472
Thank you.

41:58.141 --> 42:00.006
Hello again.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.015
Sorry to trouble you.

42:04.147 --> 42:07.105
Would you mind awfully if we hide here

42:07.234 --> 42:09.850
until this boat is at sea?

42:15.492 --> 42:17.824
I've told you everything I remember.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.614
There must be more than that.

42:19.746 --> 42:21.737
Look to yourself.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.829
You are what remains of him.

42:25.335 --> 42:27.371
Vorenus.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.959
Well?

42:33.552 --> 42:35.713
They're gone.

42:35.846 --> 42:37.382
Good.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.513
Good.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.555
And how was...Atia?

42:44.688 --> 42:48.681
I suppose she took it with her usual poise?

42:48.817 --> 42:51.354
— No.
— No?

42:53.613 --> 42:56.696
Well. Had to be done.

42:59.202 --> 43:02.786
Where's Posca?
I sent for him but he did not come.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.166
I don't know, sir.
Do you wish me to go and look for him?

43:05.292 --> 43:06.873
Oh, no, no.

43:07.002 --> 43:09.664
It's all right.

43:09.796 --> 43:11.707
I'm sure he'll turn up.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.501
Sir, your wife instructed me
to tell you something.

43:18.805 --> 43:22.798
She instructed me to tell you
that you are cowardly scum.

43:24.436 --> 43:27.553
She did, did she?

43:29.191 --> 43:32.558
And...and what's your opinion of that?

43:32.694 --> 43:35.060
It's not my place to have an opinion, sir.

43:35.197 --> 43:37.188
Nah. Tell me anyway.

43:37.324 --> 43:39.690
Is that an order?

43:39.826 --> 43:41.862
Yes. That's an order.

43:45.749 --> 43:48.081
You're no coward.

43:49.753 --> 43:52.460
But you do have a strong disease in your soul.

43:54.424 --> 43:58.042
A disease that will eat away at you...

43:58.178 --> 44:00.214
until you die.

44:03.225 --> 44:05.307
Really?

44:09.439 --> 44:11.100
And what is this disease?

44:12.442 --> 44:14.933
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

44:15.070 --> 44:16.651
No.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.237
No, you're not.

44:19.366 --> 44:23.826
So how can you be so sure
of your diagnosis, then?

44:24.955 --> 44:27.412
I recognise your symptoms.

44:29.543 --> 44:32.250
l have the same sickness.

44:53.275 --> 44:55.482
Long one.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.629
Hello, Mother.

45:18.758 --> 45:22.046
And Posca. What a pleasant surprise.

45:22.679 --> 45:25.341
I gather Antony was not amenable
to persuasion.

45:27.434 --> 45:29.675
No, he was not.

45:29.811 --> 45:33.144
But you knew that, didn't you?

45:35.817 --> 45:38.058
You wanted a villa in Capri.

45:38.194 --> 45:40.651
Now you may have one.

45:42.949 --> 45:44.689
ls Octavia well?

45:48.371 --> 45:50.908
Posca has something here

45:51.041 --> 45:53.157
that will help you destroy Antony.

45:54.836 --> 45:58.169
- Mother, I am hoping...
— Crush Antony and his queen.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.424
And you can keep your damn villa.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.433
You have something for me, Posca?

46:12.562 --> 46:16.271
It is the last will and testament

46:16.399 --> 46:18.731
of Antony and Cleopatra.

46:20.320 --> 46:23.278
To be opened and read
only on the occasion of their death.

46:23.406 --> 46:25.397
It is a despicable document.

46:25.533 --> 46:28.570
Taken together with
his repudiation of your sister,

46:28.703 --> 46:32.696
the Roman people would think
a war against Antony not only inevitable,

46:32.832 --> 46:35.790
but eminently desirable.

46:35.919 --> 46:38.706
— Is it genuine?
— It is genuine.

46:41.216 --> 46:42.831
You are a good and loyal friend, Posca.

46:57.565 --> 46:59.977
This one's cooked himself for dinner.

47:00.110 --> 47:02.066
He asks to be buried in Alexandria.

47:02.195 --> 47:05.232
He declares Cleopatra his wife
and that they are living gods.

47:05.365 --> 47:07.777
She is lsis and he, Osiris.

47:07.909 --> 47:11.026
— It's perfect.
— Wait, wait. It's better.

47:11.162 --> 47:14.620
He leaves to his children by Cleopatra
all the eastern provinces.

47:14.749 --> 47:17.991
And her son by Caesar
is to be given Rome and the west.

47:19.963 --> 47:23.922
Having rejected his loving wife Octavia,

47:24.050 --> 47:26.382
Mark Antony has coupled himself

47:26.511 --> 47:29.469
to the sorceress Cleopatra,

47:29.597 --> 47:32.384
promising her dominion of all Rome!

47:33.810 --> 47:37.052
He worships dogs and reptiles.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.474
He blackens his eyes with soot

47:39.607 --> 47:41.438
like a prostitute.

47:41.568 --> 47:44.560
He dances and plays the cymbals

47:44.696 --> 47:47.062
in vile Nilotic rites.

47:48.700 --> 47:52.443
I know how unhappy you are
and I cannot blame you.

47:52.579 --> 47:54.194
For who would not weep when he hears

47:54.330 --> 47:58.869
that the great Mark Antony
pays homage to foreign gods?

47:59.002 --> 48:01.869
That he has abandoned his wife,

48:02.005 --> 48:04.838
his child and his country?

48:04.966 --> 48:08.754
I am asked if he is gone mad,
if he is bewitched.

48:08.887 --> 48:11.128
l have no explanation.

48:11.264 --> 48:14.973
We may weep for him,
but then we must do our duty,

48:15.101 --> 48:19.060
for he is no longer a Roman, but an Egyptian.

48:19.189 --> 48:21.976
And what is left for us to do but fight him?

48:22.108 --> 48:25.020
Fight him and destroy him!

48:37.207 --> 48:39.698
Pullo. My old friend, it's good to see you.

48:39.834 --> 48:42.997
- Sir.
— Come, sit down.

48:53.098 --> 48:57.307
Posca tells me our friend Vorenus
stands by Antony even now.

48:58.144 --> 48:59.429
Loyal man, Vorenus.

48:59.562 --> 49:02.019
He sends you his best regards,

49:02.148 --> 49:04.890
asked that you kiss his children for him.

49:05.735 --> 49:10.274
— He's all right, is he?
— You know him. lron as ever.

49:11.574 --> 49:14.316
— You and he are still friends, then?
- Yes.

49:15.745 --> 49:19.738
Very soon I will have to go east
to end this thing with Antony.

49:19.874 --> 49:21.205
I want you to come with me.

49:21.334 --> 49:23.040
— Why?
— You are close to Vorenus.

49:23.169 --> 49:26.753
He is close to Antony.
It may be you can act as a mediator.

49:26.881 --> 49:30.044
Maybe we can save unnecessary bloodshed.

49:30.176 --> 49:33.885
Not to argue with you,
but it doesn't seem likely.

49:34.681 --> 49:37.798
There are some will have to die, of course.
Antony cannot be saved.

49:37.934 --> 49:40.926
— The boy Caesarion will have to go, obviously.
- Caesarion?

49:41.062 --> 49:44.680
They have named him putative king of Rome,
Pullo.

49:44.816 --> 49:46.522
He will have to die but...

49:46.651 --> 49:49.484
perhaps Cleopatra and her children
by Antony may be saved.

49:49.612 --> 49:52.319
— Preserve some stability.
- Yes.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.279
| see.

49:54.409 --> 49:57.617
I do not want to order you to come, Pullo,
but I will if I have to.

49:57.745 --> 50:00.908
No. No problem.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.702
— I'll come.
- Good.

50:10.633 --> 50:12.624
It will be like old times.

50:14.804 --> 50:16.305
An adventure together.

50:20.935 --> 50:24.098
So, Antony more or less
forced Octavian into war.

50:24.230 --> 50:27.438
Else the east would be lost to the gyppos.
We wouldn't want that, now would we?

50:27.567 --> 50:30.900
Worshipping a bunch of dogs
and cats and what have you.

50:31.821 --> 50:36.110
Anyroad, the thing is,
Octavian's ordered me to go along with him.

50:36.242 --> 50:39.530
So that's what I'll be doing.
Going along with him.

50:39.662 --> 50:42.779
— Can I come with you?
— No. Sorry.

50:42.916 --> 50:45.623
You stay here with me. We'll be fine.

50:45.752 --> 50:47.208
You'll hardly notice I'm gone.

50:47.337 --> 50:49.623
And the good news is,

50:49.756 --> 50:52.372
I'm more than likely to see your father.

50:56.387 --> 51:00.255
He sent word that
I should give you all a kiss from him.

51:09.067 --> 51:11.399
If I see him, can I give him a kiss
from you in return?

51:11.527 --> 51:14.564
No. He killed our mother.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.147
It's true, isn't it?

51:23.122 --> 51:25.033
You're a hard one, you.

51:25.166 --> 51:26.622
My father made me so.

51:28.419 --> 51:29.829
lhearyou.

51:49.274 --> 51:52.516
While I'm away,
there'll be no trouble between you.

51:52.652 --> 51:56.065
No skimming from the grain ration,
no stealing of women,

51:56.197 --> 51:59.940
nor any extortion, robbery, or arson...

52:00.076 --> 52:03.409
unless under direct licence by Mascius.

52:03.538 --> 52:05.119
Anybody steps out of line,

52:05.248 --> 52:07.705
they'll be sharing their dinner with Memmio.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.170
Don't forget your vinegar flask.

52:22.307 --> 52:24.138
Right.

52:25.476 --> 52:28.764
Give us a smile.
Won't be gone forever.

52:30.398 --> 52:33.731
If you really loved me,
you'd take me with you.

52:35.069 --> 52:38.027
It's a war, not a shopping trip.

52:38.948 --> 52:41.690
— I can take care of myself.
— I know you can.

52:41.826 --> 52:44.317
Which is why I'm not worried
about leaving you here.

52:44.454 --> 52:47.662
— Where are you going now?
— Vinegar.

53:26.371 --> 53:28.157
Memmio?

54:45.741 --> 54:49.359
This is not happening. This isn't happening.

54:50.997 --> 54:53.204
What have I done?

54:53.332 --> 54:55.459
Why are you punishing me like this?

54:55.585 --> 54:59.373
Oh, you selfish bastard. It's me who's dying.

54:59.505 --> 55:03.464
It's not you who's being punished, it's me.

55:04.385 --> 55:06.376
But it's all right.

55:07.430 --> 55:09.967
It is as...as it should be.

55:10.099 --> 55:14.388
What have you ever done?
You're a good woman.

55:15.771 --> 55:18.148
Don't get sentimental on me now.

55:18.274 --> 55:20.014
One thing I'm not is a good woman.

55:20.151 --> 55:22.142
You've been good to me.

55:22.278 --> 55:25.441
No, I haven't.

55:25.573 --> 55:27.438
Eirene.

55:28.659 --> 55:32.823
Eirene was a good woman.
Not a she—wolf like me.

55:34.373 --> 55:37.115
— She had her moments.
— She was gonna give you a child.

55:41.797 --> 55:44.129
Fate had a different plan.

55:46.135 --> 55:48.512
We're happy enough, you and me.

55:50.223 --> 55:52.464
I'm sorry.

55:57.146 --> 56:00.309
I can't go to the afterlife with lies in my heart.

56:00.441 --> 56:02.898
Nemesis won't let me rest.

56:06.030 --> 56:07.986
What lies?

56:09.242 --> 56:11.153
What's Nemesis want with you?

56:12.161 --> 56:14.152
Send these people away.

56:15.248 --> 56:16.954
Get out.

56:22.505 --> 56:25.918
Remember when I'm gone,

56:26.050 --> 56:28.336
what I did,

56:29.262 --> 56:31.002
I did out of love for you.

56:33.015 --> 56:35.006
Did what?

56:38.437 --> 56:40.928
It was me

56:41.065 --> 56:42.521
who killed Eirene

56:42.650 --> 56:44.686
and your child.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.436
I wanted you for myself.

56:48.573 --> 56:50.279
So I poisoned her.

57:07.425 --> 57:08.915
Goodbye, love.
