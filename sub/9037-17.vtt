00:03.703 --> 00:04.470
- Oh, big mistake.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.438
He's going
into the alley.

00:06.440 --> 00:10.142
My boys should be
coming right...Now.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.710
- What? Oh, you seen
this one already.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.479
- No, no, that's the way
you do it, see?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.481
First of all,
you set up a perimeter, right?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.316
You close off
all the avenues of escape.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.485
It's like
catching a mouse.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.654
- Hey, I've seen you
with a mouse.

00:23.723 --> 00:24.723
Remember this?

00:24.725 --> 00:28.694
Aah!

00:28.696 --> 00:33.098
[laughs]

00:33.100 --> 00:36.168
- Remember me beatin'
the crap outta you?

00:40.340 --> 00:42.141
Ah, they got
the bracelets on him.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.442
He ain't goin'
nowhere.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.676
- Of course he's not
going anywhere.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.678
The show's call "cops."
it's fixed.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.281
You never see the bad guy
getting away.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.517
- Let 'em get
their own show.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.319
You see the way
they ran that punk down?

00:54.321 --> 00:56.155
- You ever run like that?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.423
- I've been known to.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.590
- Yeah, when do you run?

00:58.592 --> 01:01.060
- When I have to.
- Yeah.

01:01.062 --> 01:04.496
Last time you ran was when
the wind took your balloon.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.841
- What are you saying,
raymond?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.476
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.812
- You don't think
I do this?

01:19.814 --> 01:22.147
- Come on, this is show biz.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.684
This is three months of filming
cut down to half an hour.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.753

01:29.856 --> 01:32.491
- Want to go on
a ride-along?

01:32.493 --> 01:33.659
- What?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.227
- A citizen's ride-along.

Come on, big shot.

Spend a shift in the back

with you?

01:43.137 --> 01:44.636
- Mm-hmm.
That's right.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.639
Put your ass
where your mouth is.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.444

01:52.446 --> 01:54.379
- You know
what I mean.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.183
What's the matter,
you scared?

01:58.185 --> 01:59.685
- I'm not--I'm not scared.
I'll go anytime.

01:59.687 --> 02:00.786
- How about tonight?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.287
- I can't go tonight.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.555
- Yeah, that's
'cause you're scared.

02:03.557 --> 02:04.723
- All right, go ahead.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.593
I'll go.
You set it up, and I'll go.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.795
- All right, fine,
I'll check with my partner,

02:09.797 --> 02:10.863
And we'll
get you a vest.

02:10.865 --> 02:14.733
- What do you mean,
a vest?

02:14.735 --> 02:18.370
- Bullet...Proof...Vest.

Fine. Go ahead.

Go right ahead.

to go with him

On his patrol tonight,
you know, and...

02:33.420 --> 02:36.388
Sit in the car
where all the action is

02:36.390 --> 02:39.391
And wear a bulletproof
vest, okay?

what are you doing?

03:00.915 --> 03:02.414
Close
the refrigerator.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.882
Put that on a plate.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.517
- I don't want a plate.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.819
I just want
a couple of bites.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.589
- That's disgusting,

03:10.591 --> 03:12.224
Sticking your fork
in there.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.759
Now nobody else
can eat it.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.295
- That's all it takes?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.530
This fork
was in the ice cream too.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.501
- Oh, hi, dear.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.902
You hungry?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.837
I'm sorry, I can't
offer you lasagna or ice cream.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.839
- Or chocolate cake.

03:29.809 --> 03:34.613
- He's like an animal
marking his territory.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.815
Hey!

03:36.817 --> 03:40.252
- Come on,
that was a compliment.

the wrong house.

I'm going with him.

- Yeah, yeah.

raymond to work with you?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.272
- Yeah, on a citizen
ride-along.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.474
- No one discussed this
with me.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.442
You're not going.

okay?

I don't need
a permission slip.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.518
- Oh, you do have
to sign this release form.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.422
The department can't guarantee
your protection.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.458
- I thought you were
my protection.

with a thermos full of cocoa?

04:45.685 --> 04:46.885
- Actually, no.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.389
That increases
the frequency of urination.

- I--I don't like
any of this.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.486
- You get that 10-10?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.788
- I copy.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.589
- Sergeant?
They call you sergeant?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.825
- That's his rank.
Sit back.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.896
- Sergeant.

Do they know
you lick your q-tips

05:32.433 --> 05:34.633
Before you stick 'em
in your ears?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.535

checked out okay.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.973
- Open door, yeah.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.842
Nobody even broke in.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.745
Good thing
I'm wearing the vest.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.413
It could've been drafty.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.617
- We better drive by
later.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.753
If it's open again,
we'll call in a k-9 car

05:54.755 --> 05:57.356
And, uh, send in
the bow-wow.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.391
That's a police dog.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.028
- Oh, bow-wow's
a police dog.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.898
Hmm, how do you
crack that code?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.633
- That ain't funny.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.602
And you don't talk
while we're on the radio.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.570
Now sit back!

06:13.906 --> 06:15.674
- I told you, raymond:

06:15.676 --> 06:18.377
It's important that you not
interfere with police business.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.644
- Well, what police business?

06:19.646 --> 06:21.780
We've been driving around
for 3 hours.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.850
I saw more action
on my paper route.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.485
- All right!

06:26.487 --> 06:28.453
- Hey, maybe later
we can climb a tree

06:28.455 --> 06:31.490
And save a meow-meow.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.526
- That's enough,
raymond.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.660
- I'm starting to see
what you mean

06:35.662 --> 06:36.828
About your little brother.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.996
- Yeah, see what
I'm saying?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.531
- What? What does he say?

06:39.533 --> 06:43.435
- Sit back!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

06:43.437 --> 06:46.738
- You just lost your tip.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.675
There's nothing to do.
I'm bored back here.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.577
At least run the siren
a little.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.649
This vest
is a little smelly.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.152
Hey, if you wash these
with regular clothes,

07:00.154 --> 07:03.588
Do they become
bulletproof?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.557
Okay. Okay.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.892
- 2-3, sergeant.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.093
- 2-3,
sergeant.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.495
- Got an emergency call,
patching it through.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.463
- All right.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.631
Emergency.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.133
You wanted action?
Here we go.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.470
- Robbie, how's raymond?

07:18.472 --> 07:21.773
Is he okay?
I want to talk to raymond.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.809
- Ma!

07:26.779 --> 07:27.879
- Give me the usual.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.915
I'm going
to the ladies' room.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.516
- Why are we taking a break?

07:31.518 --> 07:34.453
What are we
taking a break from?

07:34.455 --> 07:37.122
- How about a break
from your mouth?

07:40.993 --> 07:43.195
- She seems nice.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.198
- Sit down, raymond.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.167
Sit down.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.735
I want to talk to you.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.103
- All right,

07:52.105 --> 07:53.605
But I have a right
to a ginger ale.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.940
You know that?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.942
- Just stop it, okay?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.511
I'm sorry this is such
a slow night for you.

07:59.513 --> 08:03.014
- No, no, no.
There was that open door.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.819
- Enough, raymond. Okay?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.922
A slow night for you
is a good night for me.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.922
Do you understand?

08:11.924 --> 08:14.659
You have no idea
what this job entails.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.028
And your attitude is an insult
to me, my partner,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.130
And every other cop
on the force.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.599
- Relax, robert.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.033
I'm--I'm joking here,
that's all.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.535
- Yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.870
They're
just little jokes, right?

08:24.872 --> 08:25.871
I'm one big joke to you--

08:25.873 --> 08:27.606
My height,
my little quirks,

08:27.608 --> 08:29.841
The year I had an afro.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.145
- Now, come on.
That was funny.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.148
- It was the style
then, man.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.951
- All right, come on, relax.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.521
- You guys gonna order,
or can I grab a smoke?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.122
- Come on.
What do you want to eat?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.590
I'm buying.
- I'm not hungry.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.892
- Come on.
I'll buy for judy too.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.294
What does she eat,
little kids?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.563
- You just can't stop,
can you?

08:51.565 --> 08:54.833
- Look, when you're ready,
I'm out back.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.134
- Robert.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.269
- What?

08:57.271 --> 08:59.871
- Over there.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.974
- Hurry it up.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.043
- Get down.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.047
- Huh?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.315
- Get down.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.950
- Robert...

09:11.952 --> 09:14.085
I left my vest
in the car.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.590
- Now, whatever happens...

09:18.592 --> 09:20.725
Stay down.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.294
- No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.829
Call the police.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.698
- Shh.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.866
- Come on, let's go.
Hurry up, come on.

[clatter]

09:39.946 --> 09:41.279
- Get your hands
behind your back.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.314
- I didn't do
anything!

09:42.316 --> 09:43.615
- You didn't do
anything, huh?

09:43.617 --> 09:45.116
- What'd I do?

09:45.118 --> 09:47.619
- Is everybody okay?
Nemo, you all right?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.721
- Yeah, yeah.
- How we doin', huh?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.355
Wise guy.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.289
- What happened here?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.657
- Well,
we got a 10-30.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.259
Better check
outside.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.029
You all right, nemo?
- Yeah.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.898
- No getaway car.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.767
Got no friends?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.035
- That's all right.
We'll give him a ride.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.103
Get him outta here.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.372
- I'll radio it in.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.940
- Come on, ray.
You can ride up front.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.282
Come on.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.383
What are you looking at?

10:40.239 --> 10:41.239
- Ray?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.308
- Hmm.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.643
- What time is it?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.177
- Hmm.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.089
- What are you doing?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.758
Why are you lying
there like that?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.893
Take your clothes off.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.662
- Oh, I'm not in the mood.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.365
- What are you
talking about?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.167
Hey, how was
the ride-along?

11:10.936 --> 11:12.704
- It was very boring.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.407
Followed by a short period
of terrifying.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.209
- What do you mean?
What happened?

11:19.879 --> 11:22.180
- We went into nemo's
for a break,

11:22.182 --> 11:23.982
And a guy came in
with a gun.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.117
- My god!
What do you mean, a gun?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.786
- A gun. A gun.
I mean a gun.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.388
A thing they use
to rob things.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.157
- What are you doing
with a gun?

11:32.159 --> 11:33.258
- Nothing!
I didn't have the gun.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.926
- I mean near a gun!

11:34.928 --> 11:36.861
Who told you to go out
and be with guns?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.197
- You did.
- I did not.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.032
I said you could
ride in the back

11:41.034 --> 11:42.767
Of robert's police car.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.803
I never said you should
get out of the car.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.271
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.807
- Jerk! You idiot!

11:48.809 --> 11:50.275
- I'm okay. I'm okay!

11:50.277 --> 11:51.342
- Stupid, how could you...?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.445
- Ow!

11:53.447 --> 11:55.914
I need my vest again.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.883
- My god.
How did this--what happened?

11:58.885 --> 12:02.020
- Nothing,
'cause robert stopped the guy,

12:02.022 --> 12:03.722
And then we took him
to the station,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.790
And then robert booked him
and printed him,

12:05.792 --> 12:07.892
And then I told robert
I had to throw up,

12:07.894 --> 12:10.428
And judy took me home.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.429
- How is robert?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.964
- He's fine.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.933
He's--I've never
seen him like that.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.868
He just took control.
He's...

12:16.870 --> 12:18.169
You know,
it's like one minute

12:18.171 --> 12:19.904
He's my brother
who eats like this,

12:19.906 --> 12:22.907
And the next minute,
he's like this...Cop.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.008
- Why? What did he do?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.376
- I don't know.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.345
It happened so fast.
I don't know exactly.

12:27.347 --> 12:32.183
And my view was a little
obstructed by the...Table leg.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.986
- Oh, were you scared?

12:34.988 --> 12:36.254
- A little.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.922
- Ohh...

12:37.924 --> 12:39.758
- Yeah, b-but robert,
you know, was...

12:39.760 --> 12:41.159
Was not.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.494
- Well, you know,
that's his job.

12:42.496 --> 12:45.463
- I know, I know,
but I couldn't do that.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.066
I mean, what's the most
dangerous thing I do?

12:48.068 --> 12:51.269
I let the kids jump on me
without wearing a cup.

12:55.174 --> 12:59.110
Robert--
robert is--he's really--

12:59.112 --> 13:00.845
He's--he's really...

13:00.847 --> 13:02.947
- You're proud of him.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.149
- Well...

13:04.151 --> 13:07.152
He's like a...Hero.

13:07.154 --> 13:10.221
You know,
and everybody's always

13:10.223 --> 13:11.456
Making a big fuss
about what I do

13:11.458 --> 13:13.491
Just 'cause
I have some column.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.495
Robert's the one whose name
should be in the paper.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.497
- Did you tell him that?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.500
- You know what?

13:22.502 --> 13:25.069
I'm gonna do better
than that.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.204
- Who are you calling?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.173
- Hold on.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.874
Hey, max. Yeah, it's ray.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.844
Listen, you didn't put the paper
to bed yet, did you?

13:32.846 --> 13:35.513
Okay, great.
I got a great story.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.850
I went with my brother
on this police ride-along.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.485
Yeah, yeah, the big guy.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.420
Yeah, the chin-toucher.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.888
Yeah, listen,

13:43.890 --> 13:45.857
Listen, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.061
- Honey,
what are you doing?

13:50.063 --> 13:50.962
- I'm cutting
molly's hair.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.597
- Oh, no, no, sweetie,

13:52.599 --> 13:54.165
If you cut a doll's hair
it doesn't grow back.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.333
Only people hair
grows back.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.902
- Oh.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.070
Geoffrey!

13:59.072 --> 14:00.572
- No, no, sweetie,
sweetie, no.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.207
That's okay.
Just cut the doll's hair.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.275
Oh, here, see?
You missed a spot.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.347
- Hey.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.615
- Hey.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.150
Is the article
in there?

14:12.152 --> 14:14.252
- I can't...Find it.

14:16.555 --> 14:17.922
Oh, no.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.224
- What, they didn't
print it?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.291
- Look at that.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.860
- That's you.

14:21.862 --> 14:22.961
- I know.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.863
That's a picture
of me. Why?

14:24.865 --> 14:28.533
- <i>"newsday's</i> own ray barone
survives pizza holdup."

14:28.535 --> 14:30.635
I thought it was supposed
to be about robert.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.971
- It was!

14:32.973 --> 14:34.405
"sports columnist
ray barone,

14:34.407 --> 14:35.405
"while on a citizen
ride-along,

14:35.407 --> 14:38.309
Narrowly escaped gunplay
when an armed robber..."

14:38.311 --> 14:41.446
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah!

14:41.448 --> 14:44.949
- Does it
mention him at all?

14:44.951 --> 14:47.185
- "police apprehended
the suspect."

14:47.187 --> 14:48.953
That--police.
They didn't mention him.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.556
- He's police.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.024
- Oh, no.
What did they do?

14:53.026 --> 14:55.059
- Hey, maybe robert won't read
the paper today.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.096
- He's robert.
He reads it every day.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.397
He reads it.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.032
He taps
his chin 12 times with it,

15:01.034 --> 15:03.635
And he reads it again.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.169
Aaggh!

15:10.676 --> 15:12.410
- Hey, robert.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.984
Oh, you read the paper.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.320
- I only wish I didn't
have to read it again.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.926
"newsday's
own ray barone..."

15:27.928 --> 15:30.128
- Okay, okay, let me explain.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.496
- Oh, no, no need.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.098
- Listen, the reason
I called the paper--

15:34.100 --> 15:35.400
- The reason,
raymond...

15:35.402 --> 15:37.035
I think I know
the reason.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.102
It's called
self-promotion.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.271
- What? No.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.506
- What's the matter,
raymond, huh?

15:41.508 --> 15:43.141
Sports section
isn't enough anymore?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.375
- Oh, come on--

15:44.377 --> 15:47.545
- You have to be
all over the paper.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.646
- Robert.
- Ga-ga-ga-ga.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.248
Why don't you
hop on the subway,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.183
Make the travel
section?

15:52.185 --> 15:53.318
- All right, come on.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.686
- How about
the food section?

15:54.688 --> 15:56.154
"newsday's
own ray barone

15:56.156 --> 15:59.290
Enjoys salami sandwich."

15:59.292 --> 16:01.059
I'll tell you what.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.427
I'll give you change
for a dollar.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.262
You can make
the financial pages.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.298
"ray barone converts
paper into coin."

16:09.034 --> 16:10.635
- Are you through?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.971
- Yes.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.673
Unless you're gonna be
changing your clothes today.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.275
Fashion pages!

16:17.277 --> 16:20.411
- I get it!
I get it, robert.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.214
- Why are people talking?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.350
It's 8:00 in the morning.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.553
No talking before 9:00.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.488
- Oh, good, raymond.
You're back.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.689
You hungry?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.157
- No, no.
No, thanks, mom.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.559
- So how was it?

16:34.561 --> 16:36.027
- Here, you can
read about it in the paper.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.161
- No, give me--

16:37.163 --> 16:38.363
Come on, robert.

16:38.365 --> 16:42.100
- Robert,
what is that?

16:42.102 --> 16:44.335
"newsday's own
ray barone survives..."

16:44.337 --> 16:46.137
Guns?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.505
- Listen, listen,
the point was--

16:47.507 --> 16:49.240
- What did you do
to your brother?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.174
- What? What happened?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.709
Nothing happened.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.312
- Nemo's was robbed,
and raymond was there.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.048
I knew that something
would happen to him.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.649
- What happened
to him?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.518
He's standing here.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.753
He's fine!

17:01.755 --> 17:04.655
Let's celebrate with
the making of some eggs.

17:06.225 --> 17:07.392
- Are you okay,
sweetie?

17:07.394 --> 17:08.693
- Yes, I'm okay
because robert--

17:08.695 --> 17:11.329
- Oh, how could you do
that to your brother?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.331
He could've been killed!

17:13.333 --> 17:15.433
- Ma, you don't understand--
- be quiet.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.433
- What business
do you have

17:16.435 --> 17:18.102
Getting involved
in something like that

17:18.104 --> 17:19.270
With your brother there?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.172
He's gentle!

17:23.575 --> 17:25.576
- Police business, mom.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.145
My job?

17:27.147 --> 17:29.247
- Oh, stop with
the excuses!

17:29.249 --> 17:31.049
No more tag-arounds!

17:33.218 --> 17:36.487
- It's a ride-along, ma.
Okay?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.089
And you don't have
to worry anymore

17:38.091 --> 17:39.557
'cause it'll never
happen again.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.092
Gentle raymond can stay

17:41.094 --> 17:43.428
As far away from me
as possible.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.131
- Come on.
Robert!

17:47.133 --> 17:48.599
- All right, good.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.401
All right,
you must be upset, sweetie.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.702
I'll make you
some oatmeal.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.638
That'll settle
your stomach.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.774
- Who the hell voted
for oatmeal?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.176
- Forget the oatmeal.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.343
Why are you doing
that to him?

17:59.345 --> 18:01.079
- Do what?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.780
- You act like
it's nothing what he does.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.682
He stopped an armed
robbery last night.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.517
I didn't do anything.
I had to throw up.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.652
- You threw up?

18:07.654 --> 18:10.088
You should have
some dry toast.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.758
- Will you stop?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.593
Robert's the one
you should be worried about.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.229
Are you listening
to me, ma?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.164
He's the one
who's out there every day.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.532
He's the one who's
risking his life--

18:21.534 --> 18:23.601
- I know what he does.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.804
I don't need
to think about it.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.407
- Okay, I just wanted
you to know--

18:29.409 --> 18:30.775
- Enough!

18:30.777 --> 18:32.677
Your mother doesn't like
to think about it!

18:35.514 --> 18:37.515
Now--now you made me forget.

18:37.517 --> 18:41.152
What is it--
oatmeal or eggs, marie?

18:41.154 --> 18:42.220
Let's go!

18:42.222 --> 18:44.489
- Okay.
- Come on!

18:46.458 --> 18:49.193
- Excuse me.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.328
- You taking shamsky
for a walk?

18:50.330 --> 18:51.729
- Yep.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.197
- Hey, maybe I'll
go with you.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.466
- Well, you better
check with your mama.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.202
- Oh, come on, robert.
Wait up.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.737
- It's cold.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.240
You two,
button your coats.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.541
[door closes]

19:05.310 --> 19:06.844
- So...

19:06.846 --> 19:08.513
- Yeah?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.516
- You always walk him
this early?

19:11.518 --> 19:15.319
- I gotta get him to the park
before the other dogs.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.921
- Why, he fights?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.190
- Nah. Shy bladder.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.894
- Listen,
the newspaper thing.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.629
It was supposed
to be about you.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.897
You know,
I told them--

19:25.899 --> 19:28.766
- No, no, listen,
I know how that stuff works.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.502
You work for the paper.
People know who you are.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.404
You're the important part.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.840
- No, you were
the important part.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.710
- All right, listen,
I'm fine with it, okay?

19:39.712 --> 19:42.246
It doesn't matter to me
what people think.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.848
- I know.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.449
I'm glad I saw that,
though,

19:45.451 --> 19:46.951
'cause you were...

19:50.889 --> 19:52.523
Something.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.431
- Thanks.

20:02.634 --> 20:04.435
Want to go again tonight?

20:06.338 --> 20:08.873
- What are you, nuts?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.908
- Well, how about to the park?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.477
- Yeah, okay.
Park, okay.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.579
You gonna button
your coat?

20:14.581 --> 20:15.680
- Nah.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.715
- Nah. Me neither.

20:24.756 --> 20:27.625
- You couldn't listen
to your mother.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.495
Next time I say
button your coats,

20:31.497 --> 20:34.232
Maybe you'll button
your coats.

20:38.370 --> 20:41.739
And no more "cops."
that's not entertainment.
