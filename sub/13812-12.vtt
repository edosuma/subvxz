THAT AWARD IS A SCAM?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.451
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.286
MR. KRABS GIVES YOU
THAT AWARD

12:35.288 --> 12:38.389
SO YOU'LL WORK HARDER
FOR NO EXTRA MONEY.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.624
THAT IS NOT TRUE, SQUIDWARD.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.626
HE GIVES IT TO ME
BECAUSE I WORK HARDER.

YOU COULD WIN IT, TOO,
IF YOU TRIED HARDER.

SQUIDWARD, YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.971
HAVING PRIDE IN YOUR WORK
IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.741
WHY, IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE.

SQUIDWARD APPEARS
TO BE ON THE VERGE
OF A BREAKOUT.

THERE MIGHT BE A NEW FACE
ON THE WALL THIS MONTH.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.473
YOU'RE LOSING IT.

DON'T YOU KNOW THAT AWARD
IS A LOAD OF...

14:07.380 --> 14:08.246
GARBAGE.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.481
PLEASE, DON'T TELL
MR. KRABS ABOUT THIS.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.917
IT'LL HURT MY CHANCES
OF WINNING THE AWARD.

14:12.919 --> 14:18.189
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
THAT AWARD IS A BUNCH OF...

14:18.191 --> 14:19.157
BALONEY.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.859
THAT IS NOT TRUE,
SQUIDWARD.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.995
LIKE THIS HAT, THE AWARD
IS A SYMBOL OF...

14:23.997 --> 14:25.964
IT'S A SYMBOL
THAT YOU'RE A CHUMP.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.466
(<i> screams</i> )
NO, SQUIDWARD. OH!

14:28.468 --> 14:31.069
AND THIS IS A SYMBOL
OF WHAT I THINK

OF THE EMPLOYEE
OF THE MONTH AWARD!

14:34.374 --> 14:35.306
(<i> clang</i> )

14:35.308 --> 14:37.542
AN EXPERIENCED

14:37.544 --> 14:40.278
ALWAYS KEEPS A BRICK OF LEAD
IN HIS HAT.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.881
I'M TELLING YOU
FOR THE LAST TIME

14:42.883 --> 14:46.284
THAT AWARD IS
NOTHING BUT A JOKE.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.021
WHAT IF SQUIDWARD'S RIGHT?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.456
WHAT IF THE AWARD IS A PHONY?

14:51.458 --> 14:55.026
DOES THIS MEAN MY WHOLE BODY
OF WORK IS MEANINGLESS?

14:55.028 --> 14:57.161
STOW THAT KIND OF TALK, SAILOR.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.296
THIS IS WAR NOW, PRIVATE.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.899
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO THINK.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.635
THIS IS NO TIME TO GO
LILY-LIVERED ON US.

15:03.637 --> 15:04.335
BUT, SIR...

15:04.337 --> 15:07.205
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR
"BUTS" IN WAR, SOLDIER.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.172
HE WANTS YOU TO CRACK.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.508
HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU,
GET INSIDE YOUR MIND.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.545
YOU MUST STOP AT NOTHING--
AND I MEAN NOTHING--
TO DEFEAT HIM.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.814
HAVE I MADE MYSELF CLEAR,

15:16.816 --> 15:18.216

THAT AWARD

17:08.560 --> 17:11.262
I COULD WIN IT
WITH MY TENTACLES TIED.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.797
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN ME?

THAN YOU FOR 26 MONTHS--
