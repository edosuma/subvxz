00:03.699 --> 00:06.180
Um, did you guys see this?

00:06.180 --> 00:07.659
"Kevin Costner has announced
that he will no longer

00:07.659 --> 00:09.270
"be spokesperson
for the Payne Turro

00:09.270 --> 00:11.054
"or associated
with the Payne brand

00:11.054 --> 00:13.013
due to the company's
recent scandals."

00:13.013 --> 00:16.016
Why does every celebrity
have to take a big moral stance

00:16.016 --> 00:17.713
on every issue these days?

00:17.713 --> 00:19.323
I mean,
not everything is personal.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.499
Well, in this case,
it is kind of personal to him.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.675
He has a ranch
where the fires broke out,

00:23.675 --> 00:26.156
or I guess he <i>had</i> a ranch
where the fires broke out.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.723
This is not making us
look good.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.247
"Costner Leaves Payne
in the Ashes."

00:30.247 --> 00:32.249
But he's also about to star
in a Broadway adaptation

00:32.249 --> 00:33.207
of "The Cutting Edge."

00:33.207 --> 00:34.686
I wanna see that.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.080
If it helps, I do
an amazing Costner impression.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.690
You can just swap me in.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.954
Welcome to the Field of Dreams.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.086
That's "Jurassic Park."

00:43.086 --> 00:44.696
Uh, no,
it's "Field of Dreams."

00:44.696 --> 00:46.133
I literally
just said the title.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.699
Well, we're just gonna get
someone else,

00:47.699 --> 00:50.528
someone better
than Kevin Costner.

00:50.528 --> 00:53.096
Or you know,
just another someone else.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.229
Wait, no, it's like, uh...

00:55.229 --> 00:56.926
"Ah, looks like

00:56.926 --> 00:58.710
you're on the Waterworld."

00:58.710 --> 01:00.060
Mm.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.452
That was Connery.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.106
Yeah, no, I--I heard it
when I--when I said it.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.586
Yep.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.631
<i>♪ Bom bom
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:06.631 --> 01:09.112
<i>♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:13.334
Yep, I agree.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.510
He is likable,
approachable, and handsome,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.773
but Tony the Tiger
is a cartoon

01:17.773 --> 01:19.296
and the spokesman
for Frosted Flakes.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.124
I'm not saying
he should be our spokesman.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.865
I'm just saying
he's a good template.

01:22.865 --> 01:25.215
Wow, it looks like
we have a lot of ideas.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.956
Yeah, kinda.
I mean, these are celebrities

01:26.956 --> 01:28.349
that we could probably get,
but we don't want.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.960
AdamRayOkay, Horchata Soto.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.179
Are those real people?

01:32.179 --> 01:33.571
They're the biggest accounts
on TikTok.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.790
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.921
The world's a mess.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.271
And then these are celebrities

01:37.271 --> 01:39.186
that we want,
but we could never get.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.839
Uh-huh, and what about
celebrities that we want

01:40.839 --> 01:42.928
and can get?
- They're on that list.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.191
- Ah.
- Yes.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.106
Not many A-listers wanting
to be associated

01:46.106 --> 01:47.324
with the brand right now.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.760
Ooh, what about the guy
who played Snape?

01:48.760 --> 01:49.935
He has a great voice.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.894
Alan Rickman?
He died six years ago.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.374
- Snape is dead?
- Yeah.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.636
It's a damn shame.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.159
I'ma start another list.
"Gone"...

01:56.159 --> 01:57.943
- No more lists.
- "Too Soon."

01:57.943 --> 01:59.206
Oh, uh, James Gandolfini.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.598
Uh, Ray Liotta.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.252
Uh, Kobe Bryant.
Betty White.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.254
Would we say
Betty White was gone too soon?

02:04.254 --> 02:05.255
- Oh, that's--
- Excuse me?

02:05.255 --> 02:06.300
Have some respect, Cyrus.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.605
She was 99.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.172
How is that controversial
to say?

02:09.172 --> 02:12.349
Oh, my God, I've got it.
Okay, what about Gerry Spier?

02:12.349 --> 02:14.960
Hmm? Come on.
Three-time BAFTA nominee.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.440
Lead of "Chasing the Alderman."

02:16.440 --> 02:17.789
Really?
You guys haven't heard

02:17.789 --> 02:19.269
of "Chasing the Alderman"?
Where have you been?

02:19.269 --> 02:20.879
- In America.
- Oh!

02:20.879 --> 02:22.838
I played in a celebrity
golf tournament once

02:22.838 --> 02:23.839
with Andy Richter.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.188
He was awesome.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.929
We were just knocking 'em back
and going insane.

02:26.929 --> 02:28.148
Well, I was.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.497
He was waiting for me
to play through,

02:29.497 --> 02:32.064
but he said
if I never needed help,

02:32.064 --> 02:33.501
I shouldn't be afraid to ask.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.763
You sure he wasn't talking
about rehab?

02:34.763 --> 02:36.808
I don't hate that idea, actually.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.419
Andy Richter's
kind of an everyman.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.724
Do you like him?

02:39.724 --> 02:41.422
I mean, I trust your opinion
on this stuff.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.858
What do you think?
- Me?

02:42.858 --> 02:46.078
Oh, well, yeah, he is likeable
and recognizable,

02:46.078 --> 02:47.602
and he seems trustworthy.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.821
Okay. Richter's the victor!

02:49.821 --> 02:51.736
Uh, Jeremy Tugendhat?

02:51.736 --> 02:53.738
Yeah, he plays the posh
lord lieutenant to the shire.

02:53.738 --> 02:54.913
Anyone?

02:54.913 --> 02:56.915
No one knows
what you're saying, baby.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.179
- No. Thank you.
<i>- It's a great program.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.223
I--I really appreciate
the opportunity.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.442
<i>- We're all set.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.225
Looking forward to it.
<i>- See you then.</i>

03:02.225 --> 03:03.879
Bye.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.663
- Good news?
- Yeah, they wanna meet me

03:05.663 --> 03:07.012
for the management
training program.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.927
Oh, I applied to that too.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.668
Oh. Yeah, well, I'm sure

03:10.668 --> 03:11.887
you'll get a call
any second now.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.804
Any second now.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.806
Guess who just jumped
on the Sade-train.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.242
- Hmm?
- I was trying something.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.374
Didn't work.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.202
Katherine asked for my advice.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.247
I gave it to her,
and she took it.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.422
- Mm.
- Could you not?

03:25.422 --> 03:27.729
I'm waiting
for a very important call.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.861
- Oh, sorry.
- And I just got asked

03:29.861 --> 03:31.994
to interview for the management
training program.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.343
- Oh!
- Yeah.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.040
That's--that's great too.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.521
It's not that big a deal.
I've heard it's not that good.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.914
Well, I hope you get in.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.090
I mean,
we'll miss having you around.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.396
Oh, no,
I wouldn't have to leave.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.701
They switched it
to being remote this year.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.660
Oh,
then I do hope you get it.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.835
Yeah, so you'll have to

03:46.835 --> 03:48.228
figure out another way
to get rid of me.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.229
Well, there's, like, blackmail,

03:49.229 --> 03:50.273
excessive force...

03:50.273 --> 03:51.709
Framing me for murder?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.320
The options,
honestly, they're endless.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.060
Shh!

03:55.060 --> 03:56.845
You'll hear it.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.847
Okay. Wait. Here we go.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.546
Boom, Gerry Spier lays
the smack down.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.896
He just handed the other
old dude a stack of papers.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.550
Yeah, right, yeah,
but wait until you see

04:06.550 --> 04:07.899
what's in those papers.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.293
Okay, you've seen
other television, right?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.686
Where things happen?

04:11.686 --> 04:13.731
Oh, ha-ha.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.343
Okay, I'm sorry this isn't
the sort of sensationist trash

04:16.343 --> 04:17.692
you two are used to watching.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.737
You know,
where it's all drug deals

04:19.737 --> 04:22.262
and teens eating each other
in the woods.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.612
I watch "7th Heaven."
Nobody is--

04:24.612 --> 04:26.396
- Don't--don't listen to him.
- There's no drug deal

04:26.396 --> 04:28.180
in "Touched by an Angel."

04:28.180 --> 04:29.704
Oh! Andy, my man!

04:29.704 --> 04:32.576
Long time no see.
<i>- Oh, yeah, hey.</i>

04:32.576 --> 04:35.623
<i>It's--it's good to see you
again, yeah.</i>

04:35.623 --> 04:37.407
Hey, look, I'm gonna let
the ladies do their thing.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.583
I just wanted to say,
no pressure.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.150
Don't feel like
you have to agree to anything

04:41.150 --> 04:42.369
just 'cause we're friends.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.935
<i>I--I appreciate that. Thanks.</i>

04:43.935 --> 04:45.241
Hi, Andy.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.330
I just wanna say
I'm a huge, huge fan.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.418
I mean, I'm blushing.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

04:48.418 --> 04:49.506
I mean, can you see
I'm blushing?

04:49.506 --> 04:50.594
And sweating.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.900
No, I'm not.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.249
I'm just blushing.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.033
Anyway, I'm gonna let Sadie
take it from here.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.774
So we've got the Payne Turro
driving through

04:56.774 --> 04:58.950
all kinds
of different landscapes.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.823
We got the quiet,
the hustle bustle...

05:01.823 --> 05:03.346
Probably what you're used to,
right, Andy?

05:04.826 --> 05:06.306
<i>You dropped out.
What was that?</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:08.351
Oh, say what you said.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.005
I said,
"The hustle bustle..."

05:10.005 --> 05:11.963
And I said,
"You're used to that."

05:13.095 --> 05:15.750
<i>Oh, uh, yeah,
okay, yeah, sure.</i>

05:15.750 --> 05:17.273
You're losing him.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.145
Andy, we see you as
the next James Stewart, really.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.277
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>
- Yeah.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.801
Beloved and trusted,
America's friend.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.716
I mean,
there really is no one else

05:25.716 --> 05:27.152
who could lead this campaign.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.806
<i>Except for Kevin Costner,
right?</i>

05:30.417 --> 05:33.028
You know, honestly, I was
never really a fan of Costner.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.465
I was rooting for the other guy
in "The Bodyguard."

05:35.465 --> 05:36.814
The stalker?

05:36.814 --> 05:37.989
No, the baseball--
the baseball movie?

05:37.989 --> 05:39.817
No, no, no,
he's a sex stalker.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.254
<i>- Yeah, no, it was a stalker.</i>
- Huh.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.865
Hey, Cyrus.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.171
Guess how much
Andy Richter-signed headshots

05:46.171 --> 05:47.303
go for on eBay.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.478
Mm-mm-mm, 500?

05:48.478 --> 05:49.827
No, less than that.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.829
But it's good.
- Hey, can I put you down

05:51.829 --> 05:53.265
as a reference
for the management program?

05:53.265 --> 05:54.658
Of course! That's great.

05:54.658 --> 05:55.833
You got
to the interview portion.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.095
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you nervous?

05:57.095 --> 05:58.053
Nervous?

05:58.053 --> 05:59.489
No, no, no.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.143
I just thought it was, like,
a casual meet and greet.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.016
Or--or maybe less casual.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.627
Don't let me get
in your head.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.977
Try to think of it as a normal,
regular job interview.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.675
Right, I have never
actually had a job interview.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.460
Yeah, I got the job
on the assembly line

06:13.460 --> 06:14.896
because my buddy's dad
worked there.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.724
Before that, kids at school
would just give me money

06:16.724 --> 06:18.726
when I ate weird stuff.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.467
Jack,
do you even have a résumé?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.251
Mm, mm-mm.

06:22.251 --> 06:24.296
I'm sure it'll be fine.

06:25.689 --> 06:26.995
Look,
I'm just gonna call it out.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.431
Costner cut ties with us

06:28.431 --> 06:30.433
because of our recent issues, okay?

06:30.433 --> 06:34.698
But I can promise you that
we are coming back stronger,

06:34.698 --> 06:37.135
and we would love for you
to be a part of that comeback.

06:38.833 --> 06:42.402
<i>Well, uh, you know,
I believe in second chances,</i>

06:42.402 --> 06:44.055
<i>and I like you guys.</i>

06:44.055 --> 06:45.666
<i>So, uh, I'm in.</i>

06:45.666 --> 06:46.797
<i>Let's do this.</i>

06:46.797 --> 06:47.929
Awesome.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.583
Well, we're very,
very excited.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.280
We promise
that you won't regret it,

06:51.280 --> 06:53.064
and we promise no more fires.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.634
<i>You dropped out again.</i>

06:57.634 --> 06:58.679
<i>What was that last part?</i>

06:58.679 --> 06:59.810
Um, can we just end this now?

06:59.810 --> 07:01.290
We're done.
- Bye!

07:01.290 --> 07:03.423
<i>- Bye!</i>
- Ah!

07:05.468 --> 07:07.775
Uh, hey, everyone,
uh, Andy Richter

07:07.775 --> 07:08.906
is coming in today.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.038
We're gonna be
showing him around,

07:10.038 --> 07:11.126
signing contracts, all that.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.344
So best feet forward, okay?

07:12.344 --> 07:13.781
Uh, Cyrus, is the car ready?
- Yes.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.479
We have a brand-new,
luxury trim, top-of-the-line

07:16.479 --> 07:18.220
Payne Turro
for Andy to take home.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.048
And it's not, like,
a dumb color or anything?

07:20.048 --> 07:21.310
Correct.
I chose one of our

07:21.310 --> 07:23.007
non-dumb colors.
- Great.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.053
Oh, and I know
it can be intimidating

07:25.053 --> 07:26.663
seeing a celebrity in person,

07:26.663 --> 07:28.099
but as a friend of his,

07:28.099 --> 07:30.232
I can assure you
that Andy is basically

07:30.232 --> 07:31.494
the coolest guy
you'll ever meet.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.974
But maybe don't, like,
approach him.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.454
If you wanna meet him,
come to me.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.194
I'll give you the thumbs-up
or the thumbs-down.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.413
Okay,
I think what we're saying

07:37.413 --> 07:38.719
is be warm,

07:38.719 --> 07:40.808
but don't go overboard
trying to impress him.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.070
Right, exactly,
so like, Jack,

07:42.070 --> 07:43.550
I love the effort, but, mm,

07:43.550 --> 07:45.247
maybe probably didn't need
to dress up today.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.553
Oh, this?

07:46.553 --> 07:48.555
No, it's not about that.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.382
I have an interview
for the management program.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.080
- Oh!
- Congrats, dude!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.777
You're like our own
Billy Madison.

07:53.777 --> 07:54.996
Thanks, thanks.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.693
Uh, you know,
I'm definitely nervous.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.086
Oh, stop looking at me, swan.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.348
Okay, great.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.089
Jack,
let's not pull focus, okay?

08:01.089 --> 08:02.264
- Right.
- Today's about Andy Richter.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.744
Tomorrow could be a Jack day.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.355
All right, everyone! Good luck!

08:06.355 --> 08:08.705
Hi, Andy.
Welcome to Payne Motors.

08:08.705 --> 08:09.967
Thank you, thank you. Hi.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.403
- Hi.
- There's my guy!

08:11.403 --> 08:12.753
- Hey, hi.
- Come here.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.494
Oh, wow.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.321
- Hi.
- Thank you so much

08:16.321 --> 08:18.149
for coming all the way here.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.500
Oh, you know,
I have family in Michigan,

08:20.500 --> 08:21.675
so you know, um,

08:21.675 --> 08:23.067
coming here isn't a Payne.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.289
Dude, Andy, you're so frunny.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.987
Funny--sorry.
I meant to say "funny."

08:29.987 --> 08:32.076
I just--I mean, obviously,
it just--

08:32.076 --> 08:34.122
uh, [bleep].

08:34.122 --> 08:36.341
Well, Andy,
we wanted to kick things off

08:36.341 --> 08:39.127
with a little token
of our appreciation.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.608
How do you feel
about a new car?

08:41.608 --> 08:43.000
Wh--

08:43.000 --> 08:44.262
- What?
- Oh...

08:44.262 --> 08:45.655
That is incredible!
Thank you!

08:45.655 --> 08:47.352
Sorry, Andy.
Bit of a misunderstanding.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.615
That's actually my car.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.834
- Your car?
- Your car's, uh--ah!

08:50.834 --> 08:52.140
Right there, yeah.
- Uh, Andy,

08:52.140 --> 08:55.404
this is
the all-new Payne Turro.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.405
Oh.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.407
Well, that's very nice too.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.582
Thanks.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.975
- Give him your car.
- What?

09:00.975 --> 09:02.629
- Give him your car.
- Give him my car?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.500
- Give him your car.
- You can't be serious.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.414
He can get his own car.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.808
Give him your car, Elliot.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.418
Katherine.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.333
Right. Uh, Andy, uh, sorry.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.422
Just a bit
of Payne Motors humor there,

09:13.422 --> 09:17.121
pretending you were getting
the--the family sedan

09:17.121 --> 09:18.688
and not my convertible,

09:18.688 --> 09:21.648
which I don't really want
anyway, so...

09:21.648 --> 09:23.824
Oh, no,
I--I'm fine with this car.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.347
No, no, no--

09:25.347 --> 09:27.479
I'm kidding.
Thank you!

09:27.479 --> 09:28.655
- He's very--
- Wow!

09:28.655 --> 09:30.221
A Ferrari!
- He's awfully funny.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.052
I know.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.358
I know
there's not a lot on there.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.012
- It's certainly sparse.
- Yeah.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.666
Uh, where'd you go
to college?

09:40.449 --> 09:42.843
I didn't actually
fully graduate college.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.627
Oh, well, how many more
credits do you need?

09:44.627 --> 09:45.715
Well...

09:47.238 --> 09:49.327
All of them.
- Oh.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.894
I should've just said
I didn't go to college.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.461
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.810
Oh.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.290
Hope you're not writing down
that I'm a liar.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.205
No, just some notes.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.641
- Yeah, notes.
- Yeah.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.254
Over here, we have
our accounting department

10:03.254 --> 10:04.299
crunching those numbers.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.387
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.780
It's boring,
but it is necessary.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.129
Andy, Cyrus Knight.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.260
I'm a huge fan.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.610
Oh, thank you so much.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.394
I hate to ask,
but could I get your autograph?

10:12.394 --> 10:14.091
- Oh--
- Okay, Cyrus, we're--

10:14.091 --> 10:15.832
No, no, it's fine.
I'm happy to.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.660
Just make it out
to "my biggest fan."

10:17.660 --> 10:21.446
Okay,
"To my biggest fan, Cyrus."

10:21.446 --> 10:23.535
No, just to "my biggest fan."

10:23.535 --> 10:24.624
Okay.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.364
Better not see this
on eBay later.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.670
eBay?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.280
That's good, eBay.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.369
You're a funny, funny man.
- Thank you.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.893
Speaking of autographs,
how 'bout we get one of those

10:32.893 --> 10:35.460
bad boys on a contract
and make this all official?

10:35.460 --> 10:37.419
Yes, I just need
to use the restroom first.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.899
Oh, yeah.
Right back the way we came.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.030
First door on the right.
- Thanks.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.118
Mm-hmm.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.207
Really?

10:43.207 --> 10:44.818
Mm-hmm.

10:44.818 --> 10:50.780
Dude, Andy, you're so funny.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.782
Oh, no!

10:52.782 --> 10:54.262
Dude, Andy, you're so funny.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.090
That's it.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.053
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.141
Oh, hey, I wouldn't, uh--

11:04.141 --> 11:05.273
- Oh, wow, ugh.
- Hey, Andy.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.578
Hey, that's not mine.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.102
I didn't do that.
- Yeah, well,

11:08.102 --> 11:09.277
maybe call a janitor.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.495
That should be fixed.
- No, no, no, no.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.367
I'm saying I didn't do it.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.151
I walked in here.
That was already bombed out.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.370
That's got nothing
to do with me.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.501
- Yeah, no.
- I haven't even gone yet.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.677
I swear.
- I believe you.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.679
I believe--it's fine.
It's fine.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.684
Dude, Andy, you're so funny.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.382
Okay, thank you.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.906
Uh...

11:29.906 --> 11:31.473
oh, no.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.649
You know, I have not been
to Detroit in years.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.172
Oh,
I have just loved it here.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.652
There is so much to do.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.436
Oh, do you have
any recommendations?

11:38.436 --> 11:41.135
Um, yeah.
Oh, God, there's so much.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.832
Uh, go downtown.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.400
- Okay.
- Yeah, there is this one place

11:45.400 --> 11:48.620
that is on a corner,

11:48.620 --> 11:50.884
uh, in the main part.
- Mm.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.320
You're describing nothing.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.451
Oh, wait,
you talkin' about Ricky's?

11:53.451 --> 11:55.540
Yeah!
It's Ricky--oh, Ricky's.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.325
- The titty bar?
- Oh.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.153
I guess it's nice
as titty bars go, Andy.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.197
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.633
We're a sex-positive company.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.896
So we love Ricky's.
- We do.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.984
We love them.
- I'm there all the time.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.420
Okay,

12:05.420 --> 12:08.684
which one of you monsters
crap-blasted our bathroom?

12:08.684 --> 12:11.078
Andy and I couldn't believe
how disgusting it was.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.296
I--I said it was okay.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.515
- It's not okay.
- Mm.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.517
And whoever did it
should confess,

12:15.517 --> 12:16.910
so this all gets cleared up.

12:16.910 --> 12:17.954
Yeah, we'll look into that.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.260
Anyway, Andy, we're just--

12:19.260 --> 12:20.522
we're so happy
to be working with you.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.958
Me too.
You know, it's funny,

12:21.958 --> 12:23.133
because just last week,

12:23.133 --> 12:25.092
I met Ryan Reynolds at a party,

12:25.092 --> 12:27.137
and he kept going on and on

12:27.137 --> 12:29.183
about how much
he loves Payne cars,

12:29.183 --> 12:31.011
and now here I am,
the spokesman.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.273
Huh!

12:32.273 --> 12:33.665
Ryan Reynolds, the actor?

12:33.665 --> 12:35.711
- Yeah.
- Like, "Deadpool," "Free Guy,"

12:35.711 --> 12:38.148
that Ryan Reynolds?
- Yeah, I'd have to check IMDb,

12:38.148 --> 12:40.194
but yeah, I think so.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.543
- Hmm.
- Well...

12:41.543 --> 12:43.197
You know what?

12:43.197 --> 12:44.981
I forgot the champagne.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.591
Do you wanna help me get it?
- Absolutely, yeah.

12:46.591 --> 12:47.679
You need
two set of hands there, sure.

12:47.679 --> 12:48.768
- I do.
- Yeah, we gotta get

12:48.768 --> 12:49.856
a ice bucket.
- Get one for...

12:49.856 --> 12:52.423
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll help her out.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.861
- Ryan Reynolds loves us?
- I know, I heard it too.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.253
I mean...

12:56.253 --> 12:58.212
So is this something
you think we should explore?

12:58.212 --> 12:59.735
I don't know. It's exciting.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.302
- Yeah, yeah.
- But I just don't wanna be

13:01.302 --> 13:03.652
like that dog with the meat,
you know?

13:03.652 --> 13:06.089
That he crosses the stream,
and then he sees his reflection

13:06.089 --> 13:08.222
and thinks that dog's got
a bigger piece of meat,

13:08.222 --> 13:09.658
and then he drops the meat,
like, do you know what I mean?

13:09.658 --> 13:11.051
Like, that's a thing, right?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.269
Uh, yeah, I think so.
Yeah, the meat dog thing.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.662
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, listen, so...

13:13.662 --> 13:15.490
should we stick with Andy?
- See, now I'm picturing

13:15.490 --> 13:17.274
Ryan Reynolds
next to a Payne Turro,

13:17.274 --> 13:19.581
and I'm like, "What?"
- I really love that image too.

13:19.581 --> 13:20.538
So it's your call.
- It's a good image.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.844
What do you wanna do?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.803
Got the contracts
for Andy to sign.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.589
Change of plans.
Do not let him sign those.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.460
Yes, great, and do not
let him out of that room.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.027
You stall.
Stall like the wind.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.681
Champagne's this way,
but we're gonna get a bucket.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.425
And so that, along with
the death of my grandfather

13:37.425 --> 13:38.600
when I was 12,

13:38.600 --> 13:41.733
is probably why
I really fear failure.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.561
Okay, um,
thank you for sharing.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.867
- Mm-hmm.
- The question was,

13:44.867 --> 13:46.608
what's your biggest weakness?

13:46.608 --> 13:47.957
Not your biggest fear.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.916
Yeah, I can--
I'll be happy to answer that.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.527
It was a moving story,
and I'm glad you shared it.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.878
It's all--
it's all grist for the mill.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.706
- Thank--thank you.
- So thank you for that.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.751
- I'm just--yeah.
- Um, yeah.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.189
Uh, references made
to the agreement date as of...

14:02.189 --> 14:03.233
- Yeah.
- That's where the month

14:03.233 --> 14:05.061
all goes, so you got that.
- Right.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.236
And on the day of--

14:06.236 --> 14:08.195
that's where
we'll put today's date.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.893
Yeah, we don't have to read
the whole thing.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.026
I mean, I get it.
It's a contract.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.897
Well, and I'm sure
you've had a lot of experience

14:14.897 --> 14:16.725
with contracts in Hollywood.

14:16.725 --> 14:17.900
You know,
but that's show business,

14:17.900 --> 14:19.641
and this is the car business,

14:19.641 --> 14:23.601
which is whole nother business.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.255
- Okay.
- Hands are tied somewhat.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.430
All right.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.171
I think this is
the right move, right?

14:28.171 --> 14:29.956
Yeah, I mean, look,
I've never had a sex dream

14:29.956 --> 14:31.218
about Andy Richter.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.436
Have you had one
about Ryan Reynolds?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.655
Oh, yeah.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.918
I mean, it's more
of a sex/anxiety dream.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.398
- Right.
- Like, he's pleasuring me,

14:37.398 --> 14:40.401
but I keep staring at
this plate of chicken Alfredo

14:40.401 --> 14:42.185
and worrying about how long
it's been sitting out.

14:42.185 --> 14:44.187
Yeah, them cream sauces
will turn on you real quick.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.667
Like that.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.235
Ryan Reynolds' autograph
goes for way more than Andy's.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.932
I definitely think
this is the right move.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.455
Plus,
he's so holier-than-thou.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.153
Like, "I'm Andy Richter.
I'm from Hollywood.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.763
I would never clog a toilet."

14:54.763 --> 14:55.938
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>
- Hey!

14:55.938 --> 14:57.113
- Hi!
- Hi!

14:57.113 --> 14:58.767
Sorry, Ryan.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.117
We were just talking about
how someone clogged the toilet.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.118
<i>Uh, no problem.</i>

15:02.118 --> 15:03.206
<i>Happens to the best of us.</i>

15:03.206 --> 15:05.295
No, no, no, no. It wasn't me.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.254
I--I walked in,
and I saw it like that.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.995
<i>Okay. I believe you.</i>

15:08.995 --> 15:10.866
Okay, good.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.607
Well, I do think
we can wrap this up...

15:12.607 --> 15:13.869
Mm.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.349
Unless you have
any questions for me.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.698
For sure, yeah.
Yeah, for sure.

15:16.698 --> 15:17.960
Uh, do you...

15:19.614 --> 15:21.050
Have any plans this weekend?

15:22.399 --> 15:25.228
Nope.
No, just--just staying in.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.795
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.057
That's very cool.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.841
Well, uh, it was nice
to meet you, Jack.

15:29.841 --> 15:30.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.975
Okay.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.934
I'm charming.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.805
- What?
- I'm usually very charming,

15:36.805 --> 15:38.502
but I'm--I'm nervous,

15:38.502 --> 15:39.982
because I've never
actually done this before,

15:39.982 --> 15:41.853
but normally--
normally, I'm--I'm smooth.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.943
- Mm.
- I am--I'm smooth.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.292
Mm.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.772
- Right.
- And that's the end--okay.

15:47.772 --> 15:48.904
All right.
- Yep. Yep.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.384
Good to know.
Thank you very much.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.996
Ryan, we really see you
as the next Jimmy Stewart.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.172
Beloved, trusted.

15:56.172 --> 15:59.001
There's no one else
who can lead this campaign.

15:59.001 --> 15:59.915
Guys, I'm so--

15:59.915 --> 16:01.264
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

16:01.264 --> 16:02.700
<i>My kids are--
they're yelling for me,</i>

16:02.700 --> 16:04.006
<i>so I'm just gonna
cut to the chase right here.</i>

16:04.006 --> 16:05.094
<i>Look, I love your company,</i>

16:05.094 --> 16:06.443
<i>I love the cars,</i>

16:06.443 --> 16:08.706
<i>and I would absolutely
love to do this.</i>

16:08.706 --> 16:10.056
Oh!

16:10.056 --> 16:11.318
I think I speak for all of us

16:11.318 --> 16:13.363
when I say we love you, Ryan.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.799
Hey, we'll be in touch
with your agent.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.671
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome.
Talk soon.</i>

16:16.671 --> 16:17.715
Whoo!

16:17.715 --> 16:19.108
- Whoa!
- Wow!

16:19.108 --> 16:20.196
- Amazing.
- You know, I never really got

16:20.196 --> 16:21.371
the whole Ryan Reynolds thing,

16:21.371 --> 16:23.765
but after seeing him on Zoom,
I get it.

16:23.765 --> 16:24.896
Yeah.
all: Mm-hmm.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.376
- Nice work, Sadie.
- Thanks.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.204
How are you gonna break it
to Andy?

16:28.204 --> 16:29.336
- Me?
- Yeah, you kind of

16:29.336 --> 16:30.859
took the reins on this one,
so yeah.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.382
I feel like
it was both of us.

16:32.382 --> 16:35.646
Like, one hand each
holding the rein thing.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.213
I don't think
that's how reins work.

16:37.213 --> 16:40.086
There we go, see?
A double comma, you know?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.783
That's--we'll have to get
that sorted out

16:41.783 --> 16:43.785
before we go any further.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.960
I...
- Hey.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.701
- Hi.
- I am so sorry

16:46.701 --> 16:48.616
to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's all good.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.227
I--I think
we're about ready to sign.

16:51.227 --> 16:54.056
I mean,
I really, really hope we are.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.710
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.103
But just before we do,

16:57.103 --> 16:59.453
I just wanna make
absolutely sure

16:59.453 --> 17:02.586
that you're comfortable
being associated with us

17:02.586 --> 17:05.589
with the recall
and the terrible fire.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.201
If you think that doing this
could harm your career

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
in any way,
I would understand completely.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.379
You know, honestly,
just you saying that

17:12.379 --> 17:14.250
shows what a great place
this is.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.600
I'm not gonna quit
over one mistake.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.254
Well...

17:18.254 --> 17:20.082
Full disclosure,
it's not just one mistake.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.954
There's a lot of shady stuff
that's--

17:22.954 --> 17:24.434
you know,
it could break any day now.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.480
- What shady stuff?
- I can't give any details.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.135
I'm so sorry,
but it's--it's drugs and sex.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.093
Wait, what?
Okay, stop talking right now.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.965
Let me--I--I--
I'm a loyal guy.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.967
Okay? So whatever happens,

17:35.967 --> 17:37.665
we can weather it together.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
Andy, I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna work out.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.626
We have decided to go
in a different direction,

17:42.626 --> 17:43.758
spokesman-wise.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.115
Mother[bleep]!

17:53.115 --> 17:54.464
What did I do wrong?

17:54.464 --> 17:56.249
What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.424
Is it a looks thing?

17:57.424 --> 17:58.860
- Nope.
- Because I can look better.

17:58.860 --> 18:02.081
I can get a trainer,
and I build muscle so fast.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.953
- It's not that, Andy.
- Or do you want me to get fat?

18:04.953 --> 18:06.476
Do you want, like,
a funny fat guy?

18:06.476 --> 18:08.957
Because I can get
so [bleep] fat for you.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.045
No, it's not.
We don't need fat.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.133
We don't need thin.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.700
What am I gonna tell
my family?

18:12.700 --> 18:15.659
I mean, my dad
was so proud of me, and--

18:15.659 --> 18:16.791
what am I gonna tell him?

18:16.791 --> 18:18.880
- He'll understand.
- No, he won't!

18:18.880 --> 18:20.099
You don't know him!

18:20.099 --> 18:21.535
- I don't.
- I guess I'll just have to

18:21.535 --> 18:24.320
tell him that his boy's
a loser, like always!

18:24.320 --> 18:26.714
- You're not a loser.
- You don't have to tell him.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.896
What I meant to say was,
"This program will help me

18:34.896 --> 18:35.984
excel at a job
that I'm passionate about."

18:35.984 --> 18:37.377
But what came out
of my mouth was,

18:37.377 --> 18:38.943
"I'm charming."

18:38.943 --> 18:40.249
Oh, baby, that's rough.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.642
Sounds like
you really bombed it.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.165
- Thanks, Dale.
- Listen, just go back down

18:43.165 --> 18:44.471
and say it to him now.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.994
Oh, it's too late, Cyrus.
I already blew it.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.822
Jack, you have
nothing left to lose.

18:47.822 --> 18:48.866
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.390
- Come on, Jack.
- Okay.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.000
- Believe in yourself.
- I'm gonna do it.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.394
- Yes.
- Yeah. Feel it.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.178
You're kind, you're smart,
you important.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.310
- Head up, head up.
- That's right.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.615
- You got this, Jack.
- Yeah!

18:58.615 --> 19:00.182
And maybe mention me
while you're in there.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.879
Dale, for the last time,

19:01.879 --> 19:04.186
you need to find
your own path, baby.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.928
Excuse me.
I'll just be a second.

19:06.928 --> 19:07.972
- Gary, I just wanna--
- Hey!

19:07.972 --> 19:09.017
Hey! Uh...

19:09.017 --> 19:10.018
God!

19:10.018 --> 19:11.324
- No!
- Uh, okay.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.890
I'm so sorry!
I'm so, so, so sorry.

19:14.892 --> 19:15.980
<i>Should just be a minute.</i>

19:15.980 --> 19:17.504
I can't believe
we're getting Ryan.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.027
I know.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.463
Do you end up having sex
with him in the dream?

19:20.463 --> 19:21.508
Oh, no,
we never get that far.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.423
- Mm.
- I eat the pasta, though.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.468
- Yum.
- Mmm, it is so good.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.122
<i>Katherine,</i>

19:27.122 --> 19:28.863
<i>I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.</i>

19:28.863 --> 19:30.908
<i>So Ryan's not gonna do this.</i>

19:31.822 --> 19:33.911
Well, we just spoke to him
about ten minutes ago,

19:33.911 --> 19:35.217
and he said he was.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.914
<i>Well, I spoke to him
one minute ago,</i>

19:36.914 --> 19:38.220
<i>and he said he wasn't.</i>

19:38.220 --> 19:39.787
He literally told us,

19:39.787 --> 19:41.615
"I would absolutely love
to do this."

19:41.615 --> 19:43.182
<i>Ryan would love to do
a lot of things,</i>

19:43.182 --> 19:44.705
<i>but come on.</i>

19:44.705 --> 19:46.750
<i>He's not interested
in Costner's sloppy seconds.</i>

19:46.750 --> 19:48.230
<i>Plus, we've been in talks
with Dannon Yogurt,</i>

19:48.230 --> 19:49.362
<i>and I think that's really</i>

19:49.362 --> 19:50.711
<i>where his head is at
right now.</i>

19:50.711 --> 19:52.452
<i>He appreciates
the interest, though.</i>

19:54.236 --> 19:55.237
We dropped the meat.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.240
Yeah, we're meat dogs.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.634
Really?
Just right there in his office?

20:00.634 --> 20:02.853
Yep, and then
when I got back here,

20:02.853 --> 20:05.291
there was a voicemail saying
I'm in the program.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.944
- Oh, there you go!
- Hey.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.163
No, I'm not gonna take it.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.556
He's only letting me in

20:09.556 --> 20:10.905
because he's worried
that I'm gonna report him.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.689
It'd be like blackmail.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.909
Oh, Jack.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.824
So young, so stupid.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.217
Let me give you
the first lesson

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
in the world of business:

20:20.219 --> 20:22.090
take every advantage
you can get.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.831
Mm-hmm.
Some folks have rich parents

20:23.831 --> 20:25.920
who send them to ritzy schools.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.356
Other folks walk in
on supervisors

20:27.356 --> 20:28.966
jerking it to daytime porn.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.968
That's just the game.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.755
Okay. Okay.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.104
Okay, I'm gonna take it.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.323
- As you should.
- I know that's right.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.933
Great call.
Just to be clear,

20:38.933 --> 20:42.023
uh, is there an actual rule
against masturbating at work,

20:42.023 --> 20:43.981
or is it just, like,
frowned upon?

20:48.464 --> 20:50.161
We screwed up.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.163
- We gambled.
- Yeah.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.861
If you've got a 16
in blackjack,

20:53.861 --> 20:55.123
and the dealer's showing a 7,

20:55.123 --> 20:56.298
what are you gonna do?

20:56.298 --> 20:58.257
Stay?
- I do not know.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.214
You hit.
I mean, unless you want

20:59.214 --> 21:00.389
some chain-smoking grandma

21:00.389 --> 21:02.130
cursing you out in Mandarin.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.349
God, I miss Vegas.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.133
Point is, even if you bust,

21:05.133 --> 21:06.917
hitting was still
the right call.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.136
It was exciting.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.181
Just going for broke.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.053
Watch out.
Future gambling addict.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.620
Put it all on red!

21:13.620 --> 21:15.056
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, it's just--

21:15.056 --> 21:16.231
- You don't play roulette.
- I would never.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.537
I mean,
that's a sucker's game, Sadie.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.668
I know you might've been
thinking that you were

21:18.668 --> 21:20.453
making a funny joke,
but I'm not--

21:20.453 --> 21:22.150
I don't think that's funny.
- I would never.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.151
You're not stupid like that.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.022
- Yeah, I wouldn't do it.
- No.
