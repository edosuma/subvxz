WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.668
Oh, thank you.

00:02.670 --> 00:05.704
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

00:05.706 --> 00:09.041
Well, congratulate me,
I just managed to finagle

00:09.043 --> 00:11.210
reservations for two
at Emilio's.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.878
How does that sound, honey?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.581
Sounds good to me, sweetie.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.083
That is wonderful, Willie.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.052
What, is she coming too?

00:20.054 --> 00:22.921
I thought this was gonna be
<i> our</i> night!

00:22.923 --> 00:26.658
Oh, for heaven's sake, ALF,
it's Valentine's Day.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.060
Kate and I are looking forward

00:28.062 --> 00:30.162
to spending an evening
alone together.

00:30.164 --> 00:33.165
It's, it's what keeps us
from becoming bitter.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.803
I'll just spend
Valentine's Day alone.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.774
Without romance, without love..

00:41.776 --> 00:46.578
...without two bodies
beyond rational thought.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.047
[sighs]

00:50.117 --> 00:52.317
[groans]

00:52.319 --> 00:54.953
Oh, sorry. I'm back.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.755
Anyone call while I was gone?

00:57.858 --> 01:00.859
[theme music]

01:30.891 --> 01:33.892
[music continues]

01:59.520 --> 02:02.221
[instrumental music]

02:03.791 --> 02:06.225
Oh, please, Willie?
Stay home.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.695
We'll order out.
It'll be my treat.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.664
By the way, can I borrow
a couple of hundred till payday?

02:12.666 --> 02:16.235
I seem to have misplaced
your credit card.

02:16.237 --> 02:19.071
For the last time, no, ALF.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.840
[sighs]

02:22.743 --> 02:24.443
[groans]

02:24.445 --> 02:26.712
ALF, would you stop that!

02:26.714 --> 02:31.216
Now, I understand that this
is not an easy time for you.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.051
And, so?

02:33.053 --> 02:35.454
Actually, that was all.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.857
Oh. Somebody needs
a fresh diaper.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.159
Willie.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.498
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh!

02:46.500 --> 02:49.468
- What is it?
- Oh, my hands!

02:49.470 --> 02:52.404
Look at them. They're shaking
like a schoolboy's.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.406
Oh, one of my favorite
movie stars

02:54.408 --> 02:56.975
just moved
into this neighborhood.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.846
"Louise Beaumont." Why does
that name sound so familiar?

03:00.848 --> 03:04.917
Oh, she was the aging vamp
in "Footlight Fancies"

03:04.919 --> 03:08.787
and she was the tap-dancing
bag lady in Broadway and 74th.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.489
And she played
the Swedish bombshell

03:10.491 --> 03:13.992
in "Stage Door Yohnny."

03:13.994 --> 03:17.196
"I love you, Yohnny,
you big yerk."

03:18.933 --> 03:22.334
Oh, I remember Louise Beaumont.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.337
She was a minor movie star
in her day.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.439
Willie, Louise is a queen.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.143
A-and her castle's
just a few blocks from here.

03:31.145 --> 03:35.347
"Sunset Villa?"
ALF, it's not a castle.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.282
It's a retirement home.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.617
It's not unlike the place

03:38.619 --> 03:41.520
I'll be staying in long
before my time.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.089
Oh, let's do
something mad, Willie.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.359
Grab your Polaroid.
We'll swing by the home.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.128
- You're right, that is mad.
- No, no, no. You see..

03:50.130 --> 03:52.497
I'll hide
while you ask her to sing

03:52.499 --> 03:55.934
the theme
from Naughty Senoritas.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.469
[humming]

03:57.471 --> 04:01.206
Please, please, ALF. Please.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.909
Wouldn't be so bad
if you could only carry a tune.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.311
There. That ought to hold you
till we get to the sitter's.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.879
- We ready to go?
- Yeah.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.749
I'm gonna hold my breath
until you take me to see Louise.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.417
[inhales deeply]

04:12.419 --> 04:13.785
Night, ALF.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.487
[exhales]

04:15.489 --> 04:18.357
- I'm gonna do it again.
- Goodnight, ALF.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.826
We'll bring you
what's left off of our plates.

04:20.828 --> 04:24.596
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
I'm yumping for yoy.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.704
Willie doesn't understand.
He has his woman.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.573
Poor schlub.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.242
But, oh, Louise..

04:39.113 --> 04:43.015
Oh, that's it. I deserve
one night in the sun.

04:43.017 --> 04:46.518
Oh. But I'll need
a clever disguise.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.589
Maybe Kate's wedding dress.
Haven't worn that in a while.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.992
Ugh. White always
makes me look too busty.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.297
[instrumental music]

05:04.338 --> 05:05.971
Oh, wow!

05:05.973 --> 05:08.173
This could be Louise's window.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.109
That could be her nightstand.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.012
Those could be her teeth!

05:15.282 --> 05:18.917
Just my luck.
She's not in them.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.787
- 'I think it went that way.'
- 'Did you see it?'

05:21.789 --> 05:25.324
Where? Where? Oops!

05:25.326 --> 05:27.793
(male #1)
'It was the ugliest thing
I ever saw.'

05:27.795 --> 05:30.662
'Did you catch the nose
on that thing?'

05:30.664 --> 05:34.499
Hey. Oh! Gotta learn
to stop doing that!

05:39.673 --> 05:40.972
Oh, look!

05:44.278 --> 05:45.777
Uh, look,
I know it's a long shot

05:45.779 --> 05:48.613
but is this the Vatican Embassy?

05:50.284 --> 05:52.150
What is it? What is it?

05:52.152 --> 05:56.288
My guess,
it's a giant talking rat.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.824
Hey, hey, hey.
Can a rat do this?

06:02.329 --> 06:05.897
Jack, really.
D-don't you know what that is?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.100
I-it's a talking dog.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.669
Uh, I'm sorry for my friends.

06:10.671 --> 06:15.173
Oh, fine. You want a talking
dog, I'm a talking dog.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.909
The square of the hypotenuse
of a right triangle

06:17.911 --> 06:22.514
is equal to the sum of the
squares of the other two sides.

06:22.516 --> 06:26.351
Well, whatever you are, we
aren't allowed pets or visitors

06:26.353 --> 06:29.154
after 8 o'clock,
so shoo, shoo.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.689
- Wait, Bernie.
- What?

06:30.691 --> 06:33.558
Don't antagonize him.
He might be one of those aliens.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.694
Oh, no kidding.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.729
<i> Buenas noches, senor.</i>

06:39.299 --> 06:42.267
Bernie, I'm talking about
an alien from outer space.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.237
Don't hurt us.
Please don't hurt us.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.339
Oh, look,
you seem like very nice people

06:47.341 --> 06:50.142
with very little
upper-body strength.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.843
I'm gonna level with ya.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.379
And this doesn't leave the room.

06:54.381 --> 06:58.517
The guy with the pants pulled up
to his neck is right.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.318
I'm an alien.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.954
Now, I'm sorry if I scared you.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.290
People were chasing me.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.460
For those of you
who remember back that far.

07:08.462 --> 07:12.964
[loudly]
Do you eat and drink
like normal humans?

07:12.966 --> 07:15.634
[loudly]
Depends on who you ask!

07:17.404 --> 07:20.071
So you're an alien, eh?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.374
Oh, son of a gun.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.944
I always knew you guys were
up there somewhere.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.512
An alien, eh?

07:27.514 --> 07:29.214
- You know what I think?
- What?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.917
I think he's here
to make us young.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.319
Just like in "Cocoon."

07:34.321 --> 07:37.489
Oh. I never saw that movie.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.925
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.293
We rented it last week.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.162
It's the one that Opie directed,
remember?

07:44.164 --> 07:46.932
Oh, yes!

07:46.934 --> 07:50.168
It's an amazing achievement
for an eight-year-old.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.873
Let it go, Jack. Let it go.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.742
I just came to get a peek
at Louise Beaumont.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.779
Just point me to her room.
Can you do that?

08:00.781 --> 08:02.447
She's just down the hall

08:02.449 --> 08:05.250
but you can't see her
unless you're a family member.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.119
There's such a thing
as rules, you know.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.422
Well, I'm her ex-husband, okay?

08:10.424 --> 08:13.592
I just wanna get a quick
snapshot for old times sake.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.993
Excuse me.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.664
[instrumental music]

08:23.303 --> 08:24.569
[knock on door]

08:24.571 --> 08:26.137
(female #1)
'Miss High-and-Mighty.'

08:26.139 --> 08:30.108
'There's a talking dog out here
who wants to meet you.'

08:30.110 --> 08:32.744
(ALF)
'No, no, no.
I don't want her to see me.'

08:32.746 --> 08:34.746
'I just wanna take her picture.'

08:34.748 --> 08:36.748
(male #2)
Go on, go on.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.149
[gasps]

08:39.820 --> 08:40.652
Uh..

08:44.057 --> 08:46.291
Hi, Miss Beaumont.

08:46.293 --> 08:49.227
I hope my presence
doesn't scare you.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.996
Look, I don't know
what you are

08:50.998 --> 08:54.900
or who put you up to this,
but I'm not interested.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.069
So don't let the door hit
your furry butt on the way out.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.475
Who does she think she is?
Roseanne Barr?

09:08.115 --> 09:11.082
[instrumental music]

09:14.621 --> 09:16.454
Gee, she seemed
so much friendlier

09:16.456 --> 09:18.690
in "Cellblock Serenade."

09:18.692 --> 09:20.425
She treat all her fans this way?

09:20.427 --> 09:23.161
Oh, forget about her.
Let's talk about you.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.130
You've been
all over the universe.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.933
What an incredible amount
of knowledge you must have.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.970
Tell us, what's it like
in outer space?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.639
Well, it's empty.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.809
It's big. It's cold.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.880
It's like "Star Trek V,"
without the toupees.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.315
Well,<i> ciao.</i>

09:43.317 --> 09:46.718
Oh, where are you going?
Wh-where's he going?

09:46.720 --> 09:50.221
Uh, sorry. My mission's
accomplished here on Earth.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.423
Nanu-Nanu.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.093
(male #1)
'Let's try to take him alive.'

09:55.095 --> 09:57.963
'I know he's here.
I can smell his breath.'

09:57.965 --> 10:00.332
(male #3)
'Can we mess with him first?'

10:00.334 --> 10:01.733
Uh..

10:01.735 --> 10:05.170
Maybe I'll stay
until I get a ride home.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.006
Mind if I use the phone?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.675
He wants to phone home.

10:10.677 --> 10:14.946
Just like
in that movie "Splash."

10:14.948 --> 10:19.384
I swear, if my bones weren't
as brittle as saltines, I'd--

10:19.386 --> 10:22.721
(male #4)
'Eddie, what's going on
in there?'

10:22.723 --> 10:24.923
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

10:24.925 --> 10:29.461
Uh, listen,
uh, I'll be in there. Okay?

10:29.463 --> 10:35.266
Uh, remember, you never saw me.
I don't exist, okay? Bye.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.768
He's cute.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.339
Okay, what are you guys up to?

10:41.341 --> 10:44.275
Well, we don't have a talking
dog in the other room

10:44.277 --> 10:46.911
if that's
what you're getting at.

10:46.913 --> 10:50.048
(female #2)
'Hurry up, Ben.
The champagne's getting flat.'

10:50.050 --> 10:51.182
Uh..

10:52.653 --> 10:54.853
Right.

10:54.855 --> 10:58.189
She's, uh,
she's helping me...study.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.260
Uh..

11:02.262 --> 11:04.195
If I have the operation

11:04.197 --> 11:07.799
they say there's an 80% chance
that I could study again.

11:14.941 --> 11:18.143
"114.8." Perfect.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.480
This thermometer tastes funny.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.151
[instrumental music]

11:27.921 --> 11:30.488
[instrumental music]

11:32.526 --> 11:34.325
My son.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.294
I sacrificed myself
for 30 years

11:36.296 --> 11:38.063
to make him
a successful stockbroker

11:38.065 --> 11:40.498
and he put me in here. Two.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.435
They should only make that
embezzlement rap stick.

11:43.437 --> 11:47.372
I get the idea.
The boy's a lox.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.942
Why do I have 16 cards?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.744
[groans]

11:52.746 --> 11:54.079
Do you realize
that all you've done

11:54.081 --> 11:56.281
since I got here is complain?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.650
Well, there's got to be more!

11:58.652 --> 12:00.785
Well, you're the one
who broke up the gin game.

12:00.787 --> 12:05.356
What's your problem, anyway?
Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.759
I just think
you're wasting some wonderful

12:07.761 --> 12:10.462
valuable, precious time.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.363
Let's have some fun.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.200
How about I take you on the roof
and show you where I'm from?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.935
Would you like that?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.838
This isn't just a trick
to use us

12:19.840 --> 12:23.842
as sex drones
to repopulate your planet.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.810
Again with that fantasy!

12:27.948 --> 12:31.683
Up on the roof? Well,
we-we could get into trouble.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.853
I know, I know.
It's against the rules.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.989
Who cares?
This isn't a prison!

12:37.991 --> 12:41.693
You have choices.
Take a chance for once.

12:41.695 --> 12:44.262
Besides, who's gonna tell?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.030
Okay, let's do it.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.666
Hey, we're breaking the rules.
How does it feel, Bernie?

12:48.668 --> 12:51.736
Well, I wish I hadn't taken
that water pill.

12:51.738 --> 12:55.106
Well, as long as it's not
windy up there, we're okay.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.475
Come on, let's go!

12:57.477 --> 13:00.445
[instrumental music]

13:05.218 --> 13:08.453
Oh, it's you again. Get out.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.189
Do you want me to call
the night supervisor?

13:11.191 --> 13:12.724
Oh, come on, Lou

13:12.726 --> 13:14.292
I'm taking
the over-the-hill gang

13:14.294 --> 13:16.594
to the roof
to show them where I'm from.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.563
I may even do my lounge act.

13:18.565 --> 13:22.167
I've been described
as a short Wayne Newton.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.736
I'm sorry. I'm too busy.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.337
Doing what?

13:26.339 --> 13:29.274
Staring out the window?

13:29.276 --> 13:33.144
Every once in a while,
a man walks by with a tire iron.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.747
Something's going down,
I know it.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.351
Look, why don't you just come
and join the party?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.720
Look, I just
don't want to, okay?

13:42.722 --> 13:45.456
Isn't there another
aging actress you can bother?

13:45.458 --> 13:48.393
Try Milton Berle.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.128
Fine.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.163
Just that I took
a lot of chances coming here

13:52.165 --> 13:54.132
to catch a glimpse
of the person

13:54.134 --> 13:56.901
that Eleanor Roosevelt
once called

13:56.903 --> 14:00.471
the "Sexiest Woman Alive."

14:00.473 --> 14:02.073
Stop it.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.776
Leave me alone.

14:04.778 --> 14:08.780
I don't need you to remind me
that I was once important, okay?

14:08.782 --> 14:10.481
You don't know what it's like

14:10.483 --> 14:13.284
to suddenly end up
in a home somewhere

14:13.286 --> 14:16.154
with a bunch of people
you don't know.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.991
And have nothing left
to look forward to.

14:21.795 --> 14:24.362
Ha! Have I got a story.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.899
Well, save it.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.168
[knock on door]

14:30.170 --> 14:32.437
Let's go, ALF.
Ben's studying again.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.072
We heard him through the vents.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.175
Okay, okay. I'll be right out.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.911
Check, check your fly.

14:42.582 --> 14:46.284
Louise, please.
Change your mind.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.853
These people aren't so bad.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.456
Sure, you don't wanna listen
to them suck on a hard candy

14:51.458 --> 14:53.825
but they grow on you.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.527
Oh, go on. Join the others.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.630
[chuckles]
I've spent most of my life alone

14:58.632 --> 15:01.633
another couple of years
won't kill me.

15:01.635 --> 15:02.834
Okay.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.404
Do you think
I could take your picture?

15:07.641 --> 15:09.440
[camera clicks]

15:11.011 --> 15:12.777
For what it's worth

15:12.779 --> 15:16.147
this is still one of the nicest
moments of my life.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.117
[instrumental music]

15:21.655 --> 15:23.621
[crickets chirping]

15:25.425 --> 15:28.092
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Ha, ha. Yeah! We made it!

15:28.094 --> 15:32.130
Hey, high fives and low fours
all around. Come on.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.400
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, isn't this beautiful?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.168
[chuckles]

15:37.170 --> 15:41.406
Oh, look. Look.
Th-there's your mothership.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.041
Wave!

15:43.043 --> 15:47.412
Yoo-hoo? Yoo-hoo, down here!

15:47.414 --> 15:50.682
Get ready to be transported!

15:50.684 --> 15:54.252
Rebecca,
that's the Goodyear blimp.

15:54.254 --> 15:58.056
Sure. That's what
they'd like you to think.

15:58.058 --> 16:02.393
Becca, open your eyes.
We're not going anywhere.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.229
ALF, you said you'd show us
where you're from.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.299
Yes, ALF, let us in
on that wondrous secret

16:08.301 --> 16:11.235
that few humans will ever know.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.137
I'll do my best.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.007
Let's see. I think you can
see it right over there.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.776
Yup, right there. See?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.578
It's that cheap,
white tract home

16:20.580 --> 16:24.082
three houses in from the corner.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.118
Kind of makes you feel
insignificant, doesn't it?

16:28.688 --> 16:31.155
Oh, no, no, no,
that's the house I'm staying in

16:31.157 --> 16:33.091
while I'm on Earth.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.393
See, my planet exploded.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.464
My lawyers recommend I make
no further comment at this time.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.898
Hey, look.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.601
Ben's got quite a setup
over here.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.771
He's always up here studying.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.607
That settles it.
I'm going for that operation.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.044
[jazz music on stereo]

16:53.046 --> 16:56.014
Oh, isn't it romantic, though?

16:56.016 --> 16:59.751
All the lights
and, and the music and..

16:59.753 --> 17:02.954
Oh, ALF. Thank you.

17:02.956 --> 17:07.358
I'm going to send you
a big soup bone later.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.061
Hey, alright!

17:10.063 --> 17:13.131
Well, ahem, who wants to dance?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.969
Hey. See?
What'd I tell ya?

17:17.971 --> 17:20.338
I knew he had the hots for her.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.982
Hey. I'm glad
you changed your mind.

17:30.984 --> 17:33.985
We were just getting down
with our bad selves.

17:33.987 --> 17:36.587
I-I just came up
for some fresh air.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.224
And..

17:40.226 --> 17:45.696
Well, maybe I am a little
curious about where you're from.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.864
Okay.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.768
Well..

17:50.770 --> 17:53.237
See that cheap, white tract home

17:53.239 --> 17:56.007
three houses in from the corner?

17:56.009 --> 17:57.208
Yes.

17:59.813 --> 18:03.981
Well, if you look straight up..

18:03.983 --> 18:06.684
...it's the big star
directly above it.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.587
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.589
[chuckles]
That's so amazing!

18:12.759 --> 18:16.394
Just think,
a whole other world.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.599
Do you, do you miss it?

18:22.836 --> 18:24.235
Every day.

18:26.706 --> 18:31.375
How do you keep your spirits up
so far from home?

18:31.377 --> 18:36.114
Well, I found making other
people's lives miserable helps.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.417
But you've gotta find
your own way.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.487
Louise, why don't you go over
there and see if they wanna--

18:42.489 --> 18:45.223
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.091
Uh, maybe I better
go back downstairs.

18:47.093 --> 18:50.161
No, no, no.
You just got here!

18:50.163 --> 18:54.465
Besides, what good
is sitting alone in your room?

18:54.467 --> 18:58.202
Come. Hear the music play.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.674

Okay, okay.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.078
Wouldn't be so bad
if you could carry a tune.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.312
[chuckles]

19:12.452 --> 19:14.485
[quietly]
You know, Bernie,
it would be a nice gesture

19:14.487 --> 19:16.921
if you went over
and asked Louise to dance.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.456
[loudly]
What?

19:18.458 --> 19:21.192
[screams]
Dance with her!

19:21.194 --> 19:24.629
She's already dancing.
She didn't want me, the witch.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.430
Oh, no. Louise.

19:26.432 --> 19:29.200
Look, just dance with her,
will you? Do it for me.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.169
Do it as a favor, huh?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.307
Uh-oh.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.409
- Would you like to dance?
- Mm-hm.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.115
I hope she asked me to dance.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.519
[jazz music on stereo]

19:52.492 --> 19:56.494
Well, Tonto,
I think our work here is done.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.133
Jack, watch the hands!

20:02.135 --> 20:04.335
I run a clean dance hall here.

Ah!

[instrumental music]

20:24.824 --> 20:29.460
And then, when I was at MGM,
I went out with Clark Gable.

20:29.462 --> 20:35.499
Wow! Hey, is it true what they
say about men with big ears?

20:40.807 --> 20:43.441
- ALF!
- Willie.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.711
I see you got my message.
Come on over.

20:46.713 --> 20:51.682

Oh, look. We have a visitor.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.985
Who died?

20:53.987 --> 20:55.386
What were you thinking?

20:55.388 --> 20:58.289
I can't believe you'd
expose yourself like this!

20:58.291 --> 21:01.158
What? I'm wearing a sweatshirt.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.793
You know what I mean.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.529
Hey, lighten up.
I'll fill you in later.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.231
Now, I want you
to meet my friends.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.534
- 'Bernie, Rebecca, Jack..'
- Hello there.

21:10.536 --> 21:14.005
And, of course, Louise Beaumont.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.172
How do you do?

21:15.174 --> 21:17.742
This is my best friend, Willie.

21:17.744 --> 21:22.013
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
I'll pay for the damages.

21:22.015 --> 21:25.182
- Come on. We should be going.
- Well, just a second.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.154
I have to say goodbye now.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.024
I'll always remember you guys.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.793
Only wish you could say the same
about me.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.195
Goodbye, ALF.

21:38.197 --> 21:41.866
I want you to have this.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.403
It's the scarf I wore
in "Stage Door Yohnny."

21:47.640 --> 21:50.274
Oh, thank you!

21:50.276 --> 21:54.712

to return the favor.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.914
You already have, dear.

- Goodbye.
- Bye.

I don't know why, but I think
I may be proud of you.
