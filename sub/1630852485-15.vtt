<i> Hey, folks, this is</i>
<i> Ronald the Survival Guy.</i>

00:04.730 --> 00:07.080
<i> Today, I am building</i>
<i> a primitive lean-to,</i>

00:07.233 --> 00:08.656
<i>ideal if you ever find yourself</i>

00:08.734 --> 00:10.843
<i> in the case of</i>
<i> emergency shelter.</i>

00:10.994 --> 00:13.070
<i> As you can see,</i>
<i> I've already gathered</i>

00:13.072 --> 00:14.404
quite the stack of brush.

00:14.406 --> 00:18.851
And with my trusty knife,

00:19.002 --> 00:21.061
<i> I'm sharpening this y-stick.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.173
Now, I usually don't get
personal on these blogs,

00:25.192 --> 00:26.341
but a lot of you've been asking

00:26.360 --> 00:29.144
why Brittany is no longer
in my videos.

00:30.272 --> 00:32.814
<i> Long story short,</i>
<i> she met a gentleman</i>

00:32.849 --> 00:37.703
<i> with another more, heh,</i>
<i> popular bushcraft vlog.</i>

00:37.780 --> 00:39.780
<i> I'm not gonna say names.</i>

00:39.856 --> 00:43.167
<i> But just so you know,</i>
<i> it's gonna take a lot more</i>
<i> than that to break me.</i>

00:44.119 --> 00:45.269
<i> Oh, wow.</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:47.880
<i> I don't know if</i>
<i> you guys can see this, but...</i>

00:48.031 --> 00:50.698
an alligator lizard
just paid us a visit.

00:50.776 --> 00:54.344
How about I show you all how to
grill up a little lizard snack?

00:55.297 --> 00:56.388
(laughs)

00:58.117 --> 01:00.267
(grunts, laughs)
He's wily.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.228
(grunts)

01:04.565 --> 01:06.190
Wily. (grunts)

01:07.793 --> 01:09.485
(screaming)

01:10.071 --> 01:12.362
<i> Oh God! Ow!</i>

01:19.805 --> 01:20.746
TOMMY:
Hello!

01:20.897 --> 01:22.823
Austin Emergency Services!

01:22.899 --> 01:24.249
He's gotta be close.

01:24.401 --> 01:27.828
Guy told dispatch he was
half a click south of the road

01:27.980 --> 01:29.088
before his cell dropped out.

01:29.164 --> 01:31.498
Better than a whole click,
I guess.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.150
RONALD:
Hey, I'm here! Please help!

01:33.152 --> 01:35.928
Alright. Emergency services.
We're coming to you!

01:36.004 --> 01:37.487
RONALD (groaning): I'm here!

01:37.489 --> 01:39.264
I'm here. Oh, God.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.675
(groaning)
I'm here. I'm...

01:41.769 --> 01:44.937
-I'm here (groaning)
-Alright.

01:45.013 --> 01:47.255
TK, get his vitals.
Nancy, inspect the wound.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.941
-Oh, God.
-I understand you have
a stab wound.

01:49.017 --> 01:51.426
-Is that correct?
-I accidentally got myself.

01:51.503 --> 01:53.946
Cap, I'm seeing a strange lump.

01:54.022 --> 01:55.856
-Cap, it moved! The lump moved.
-Ah!

01:55.932 --> 01:58.099
Oh, yeah, it's a sneaky
little bastard, alright.

01:58.177 --> 02:00.452
-Holy God. What is that?
-Alligator lizard.

02:00.529 --> 02:01.695
That's what I was going for

02:01.789 --> 02:04.014
when I got myself
and then it climbed inside.

02:04.032 --> 02:06.016
(screaming)
Just get it out!

02:06.034 --> 02:07.701
-Please.
-Alright. Alright.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.128
TK, grab your tourniquet.

02:09.279 --> 02:12.047
Let's keep that little bugger
from going up any higher.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.282
(Ronald groans)

02:14.301 --> 02:15.634
(screams)

02:15.785 --> 02:16.784
Just one last twist.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.262
-(screams)
-There we go.

02:19.381 --> 02:20.213
Dude is lit.

02:20.366 --> 02:21.306
RONALD:
And it's mating season,

02:21.458 --> 02:22.641
so he's gonna already
be worked up.

02:22.792 --> 02:25.460
If he comes out, he's gonna be
looking to attack.

02:25.554 --> 02:26.720
Then we'll give him
something to attack.

02:26.796 --> 02:28.129
TK, grab his shoulders.

02:28.207 --> 02:29.222
Nancy, hold his feet.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.041
-Yeah, Cap.
-(groans)

02:31.043 --> 02:32.225
TOMMY:
Ron, listen to me.

02:32.302 --> 02:33.819
I'm gonna need you
to brace yourself, okay?

02:33.896 --> 02:34.802
This is gonna hurt.

02:35.063 --> 02:36.880
It can't hurt
more than it already does.

02:36.882 --> 02:38.382
Okay, here we go.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.884
-(Ronald screaming)
-NANCY: Cap, what are you doing?

02:40.903 --> 02:42.327
You're just gonna
piss it off even more.

02:42.404 --> 02:44.163
-That's the idea.
-(groaning)

02:44.239 --> 02:47.073
-TOMMY: Come on.
-RONALD (screaming):
Oh, God!

02:47.226 --> 02:49.393
-Come on.
-(Ronald screaming)

02:49.411 --> 02:51.044
Okay, that's it.

02:52.748 --> 02:55.232
(quietly):
There he is.

02:55.250 --> 02:58.177
TK, grab the biohazard bag.
There we go.

02:59.329 --> 03:00.295
There.

03:00.572 --> 03:02.572
Cap, what are we gonna
do with this thing?

03:02.591 --> 03:05.517
Uh, that's for Animal Control
to sort out.

03:05.669 --> 03:07.686
Let's package him up,
get him ready for travel.

03:07.763 --> 03:08.836
How you doing, Ron?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.355
Oh, better.
But-but could you--

03:10.432 --> 03:12.782
Yes, Nancy, uh, would you
get rid of the tourniquet?

03:12.784 --> 03:14.751
-It's got to hurt like hell.
-RONALD: Thanks.

03:14.753 --> 03:16.862
Say, could you hold it up
for the camera?

03:17.013 --> 03:19.281
My subscribers are gonna
wanna see a close-up.

03:25.614 --> 03:28.690
(theme music playing)

03:28.767 --> 03:32.285
DR. PATT:
So when we last spoke,
we talked about you

03:32.362 --> 03:34.788
making a note of those moments
during the week

03:34.864 --> 03:39.176
when you felt rage building
or an urge to lash out.

03:39.778 --> 03:40.777
Yeah.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.262
DR. PATT: And how did that fare?

03:50.046 --> 03:51.230
Mm-hmm.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.565
Okay.

03:55.552 --> 03:56.643
I see.

03:56.795 --> 03:58.028
Okay.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.240
Right.

04:01.316 --> 04:02.324
Huh.

04:03.393 --> 04:04.326
Okay.

04:04.803 --> 04:06.036
Oh, wow.

04:06.896 --> 04:08.396
Should you be saying "wow"?

04:08.474 --> 04:10.415
It's fairly frequent, isn't it,

04:10.567 --> 04:11.491
these feelings of rage?

04:11.827 --> 04:13.643
When I told you
I was pissed off all the time,

04:13.645 --> 04:15.128
I meant all the time.

04:16.498 --> 04:18.799
I just don't know
why all of a sudden.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.094
Well, maybe it's not
as sudden as you think.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.579
It's possible
that the roots of your anger

04:24.598 --> 04:26.181
go deeper than you know.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.842
I'd like to try something.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.510
Have you heard of EMDR?

04:30.587 --> 04:32.178
I think I listened to 'em
in the '80s.

04:32.331 --> 04:36.516
No, it's
Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.593
It's a form of therapy
that allows us

04:38.670 --> 04:40.946
to occupy your active mind

04:41.023 --> 04:43.673
so as to free up
your unconscious mind.

04:43.692 --> 04:46.676
And you think that's gonna
unlock the source of my rage?

04:46.678 --> 04:48.245
It might.

04:50.516 --> 04:52.457
Now watch the ball
on the screen.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.519
Deep breaths.

04:55.521 --> 04:56.503
Follow the ball.

04:58.524 --> 04:59.798
Breathing.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.282
Good.

05:01.618 --> 05:04.052
Okay, what do you see
in your mind's eye right now?

05:04.863 --> 05:06.546
A spot on my lung.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.307
My tumor.

05:08.534 --> 05:10.625
-DR. PATT: Deep breaths.
-(Owen exhales)

05:10.644 --> 05:12.126
Follow the ball.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.229
And what do you see now?

05:16.041 --> 05:17.566
My son in a hospital bed.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.561
He's got a tube down his throat.

05:21.563 --> 05:24.364
DR. PATT: Watching the ball.
What about now?

05:26.718 --> 05:28.493
A red, uh...

05:28.645 --> 05:29.644
Big red nose.

05:29.721 --> 05:31.571
Like a bloody nose?

05:31.648 --> 05:33.040
No, like a-a, uh...

05:34.335 --> 05:35.742
Like, like a rubber, like a--

05:35.894 --> 05:37.377
It's a clown.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.564
Alright, I think
that's a good start.

05:40.657 --> 05:42.065
Let's take a break.

05:42.158 --> 05:44.250
(exhales) Yeah, I think we got
a little off-track there.

05:44.327 --> 05:47.012
I think we are right on our way,
actually.

05:47.831 --> 05:49.431
Tell me about the clown.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.184
-What?
-The clown.

05:52.335 --> 05:54.411
It's the only time that you took
your eyes away from the screen

05:54.429 --> 05:58.598
and your respiration
became notably more rapid.

05:58.675 --> 06:00.550
I think it's telling.

06:00.586 --> 06:01.751
Except it isn't.

06:01.753 --> 06:02.844
It just popped into my head.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.679
It doesn't mean anything.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.013
All the other associations

06:06.108 --> 06:07.591
had to do with
some sort of trauma.

06:07.593 --> 06:10.535
I don't have any trauma
around clowns.

06:10.687 --> 06:13.613
When you think about clowns,
what comes up?

06:13.765 --> 06:14.948
John Wayne Gacy.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.024
The Joker, Pennywise.

06:17.102 --> 06:18.618
All negative representations.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.027
Uh, 'cause clowns are awful.

06:20.122 --> 06:23.106
So it's possible that you
suffer from coulrophobia,

06:23.125 --> 06:26.793
which is the irrational
or extreme fear of clowns.

06:26.870 --> 06:31.723
My "fear of clowns" is-is
neither irrational nor extreme.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.559
But you do have very strong
feelings about clowns.

06:34.711 --> 06:36.395
So how are you coping with that?

06:39.625 --> 06:41.983
I avoid the circus.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.481
Okay, sir,
I'm gonna get help to you.

06:48.558 --> 06:49.891
Can you give me your address?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.060
I-I-I can't. I don't...
I don't, I don't live here.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.747
<i> I'm renting this condo</i>
<i> for a work trip.</i>

06:55.899 --> 06:56.973
(man coughs over phone)

06:56.992 --> 06:58.825
<i> Oh, my God,</i>
<i> there's so much smoke.</i>

06:58.902 --> 07:02.178
Okay. I need you to
stay low and stay calm.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.663
I'm Dave.
Can you give me your name?

07:03.740 --> 07:05.649
-JORDAN (over phone):<i> Jordan.</i>
-DAVE: Okay, Jordan.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.074
<i> Let's forget the address.</i>

07:07.094 --> 07:09.076
Can you recall for me
any cross streets,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.096
Anywhere you might have gone
for a takeaway?

07:11.173 --> 07:12.413
<i> -A takeout?</i>
-JORDAN: Yes.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.142
I get coffee every morning
at Capitol Roasters.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.510
DAVE: Brilliant. I see it.

07:17.663 --> 07:19.137
That puts you on Congress.

07:19.289 --> 07:20.830
JORDAN:
<i> That's right! That's right!</i>

07:20.832 --> 07:21.848
It's the tower
across the street.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.442
Can you tell me
what unit you're in?

07:23.518 --> 07:24.834
JORDAN:
<i> I'm on the fifth floor,</i>

07:24.853 --> 07:26.111
but I'm not in my unit.

07:26.262 --> 07:27.446
I'm in a hallway.

07:27.522 --> 07:29.005
Okay, then let's get you
to some stairs.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.265
That's what I'm looking for
but I can't find it.

07:31.343 --> 07:32.934
<i> I can barely see</i>
<i> with all this smoke.</i>

07:33.028 --> 07:36.012
Alright. I am pulling up
the building blueprints.

07:36.014 --> 07:38.698
But for now, I need to get you
behind a closed door

07:38.775 --> 07:40.107
and away from that smoke.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.793
Do you think you can
find your way back

07:41.870 --> 07:43.420
to your unit for me?

07:44.873 --> 07:48.041
The ceiling's falling!
(coughs)

07:48.117 --> 07:50.376
I don't know where I am and
now I'm really turned around.

07:50.529 --> 07:51.695
DAVE (over phone):<i> Okay. Okay.</i>

07:51.697 --> 07:53.287
I want you
to start banging on doors.

07:53.365 --> 07:56.057
Let's see if we can find someone
to let you inside.

07:57.035 --> 07:58.185
Hello!

07:59.128 --> 08:00.870
Hey! Open up!

08:00.872 --> 08:02.539
<i> The building's on fire!</i>

08:02.557 --> 08:03.464
<i> Hello!</i>

08:03.484 --> 08:06.209
<i> Help!</i>
<i> Please, I need help!</i>

08:06.211 --> 08:08.820
Dave, the building's
mostly empty.

08:08.972 --> 08:11.231
-DAVE:<i> I understand, Jordan.</i>
-(coughs)

08:11.307 --> 08:13.325
Okay, I've got
the building blueprints
in front of me.

08:13.401 --> 08:16.569
Tell me what unit you are
standing in front of right now.

08:16.722 --> 08:18.163
(coughs) 526.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.405
Okay, excellent, excellent.

08:19.558 --> 08:21.482
There is a set of stairs
to the left

08:21.502 --> 08:22.575
around the corner.

08:22.652 --> 08:23.943
I need you to stay low

08:24.095 --> 08:25.562
and head that direction.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.730
Uh... (coughs)

08:26.823 --> 08:28.840
I can't go that way.
It's all on fire now.

08:28.917 --> 08:32.511
Uh, Jordan, uh...
change of plan.

08:32.662 --> 08:34.495
It looks like there is
a workout room

08:34.515 --> 08:36.130
across the hall
down to the other end.

08:36.241 --> 08:37.164
<i> With a little luck,</i>

08:37.425 --> 08:38.683
<i> we're not gonna need</i>
<i> a key to get in there.</i>

08:38.835 --> 08:40.927
(coughing)

08:41.021 --> 08:41.761
JORDAN: I found it!

08:42.097 --> 08:43.688
Okay, get inside.
Close that door.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.358
(alarm blaring)

08:46.434 --> 08:48.401
JORDAN: Oh, God.
Alright. I'm in.

08:48.511 --> 08:50.754
<i> The air's</i>
<i> a little better in here.</i>

08:50.756 --> 08:52.346
It's about to get even better.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.866
There are some windows
on the north side of the room,

08:54.943 --> 08:58.185
so I want you to take something
heavy and smash those windows.

08:58.263 --> 09:00.205
JORDAN:
<i> I-I don't see any windows.</i>

09:00.282 --> 09:03.208
DAVE: Um, the north side
of the room, Jordan.

09:03.359 --> 09:04.951
Three big bay windows.

09:05.103 --> 09:07.045
But there aren't any.
Just walls.

09:07.122 --> 09:10.966
No, no, no. No, they're
right here on the blueprint.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.051
Jordan...

09:13.128 --> 09:16.462
are you absolutely sure
there are no windows?

09:16.615 --> 09:19.224
Yeah, I'm telling you,
no windows!

09:19.301 --> 09:20.392
<i> The smoke's coming in.</i>

09:20.468 --> 09:22.543
(panting)
<i> Dave, what do I do?</i>

09:22.563 --> 09:25.564
Gym, gym, uh, gym.
What else is in a gym?

09:25.715 --> 09:27.791
Um... Jordan?

09:27.793 --> 09:29.475
Are there water coolers?

09:29.628 --> 09:30.384
JORDAN (coughs): Yes.

09:30.462 --> 09:31.811
Towels. What about towels?

09:31.963 --> 09:33.071
Yeah, they have,
they have both.

09:33.148 --> 09:35.240
Good. Good.
We are going to create

09:35.317 --> 09:36.482
a defensive space

09:36.577 --> 09:38.635
to keep you safe
until first responders arrive.

09:38.653 --> 09:41.304
So what I need you to do
is start wetting those towels.

09:41.306 --> 09:43.306
Take the first towel
and cover your mouth

09:43.308 --> 09:45.992
<i> and with the others,</i>
<i> we're gonna stuff them</i>
<i> under the door</i>

09:46.144 --> 09:47.544
to stop that smoke.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.573
Hey, Rescue 122
is three minutes out.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.093
He's on the fifth floor.
He's not gonna make it.

09:56.746 --> 09:58.597
(key clacks)

09:58.748 --> 09:59.823
How we doing, Jordan?

09:59.841 --> 10:02.267
JORDAN:
<i> The door's gettin' really hot.</i>

10:03.437 --> 10:04.677
(groans) The towels,

10:04.754 --> 10:06.271
<i> they're catching on fire!</i>

10:07.499 --> 10:11.351
Okay. I need you
to step away from that door

10:11.427 --> 10:12.836
as far as you possibly can.

10:12.854 --> 10:15.004
Keep your face covered.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.406
Are the firefighters close?

10:17.433 --> 10:18.358
Any second now.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.951
JORDAN:
<i> So they're not here yet?</i>

10:20.028 --> 10:21.602
They are coming
as fast as they can,

10:21.622 --> 10:24.030
and they know exactly
where to find you.

10:24.182 --> 10:26.291
They're not gonna
make it in time, Dave.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.753
(voice breaking):
Fire's coming in.

10:31.781 --> 10:33.447
Oh, God, so this is it.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.301
No, no, no, no, Jordan,
this is not it.

10:36.452 --> 10:38.711
-We are not giving up.
-(Jordan breathing heavily)

10:38.864 --> 10:41.264
JORDAN:
<i> I wasn't even supposed</i>
<i> to come on this trip.</i>

10:42.643 --> 10:44.384
I volunteered.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.394
My wife said, "Go, have fun."

10:47.314 --> 10:49.038
My two kids hugged me goodbye.

10:49.132 --> 10:50.649
(Jordan breathing heavily)

10:50.725 --> 10:51.983
(crying)<i> I'm...</i>

10:52.210 --> 10:54.027
<i> I'm never gonna</i>
<i> see 'em again.</i>

10:58.325 --> 11:00.825
(siren wailing in distance)

11:00.977 --> 11:02.068
(weakly): I hear sirens.

11:02.220 --> 11:05.121
I need you to
hang on in there, Jordan.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.501
JORDAN (breathes heavily):
<i> Dave?</i>

11:09.728 --> 11:11.127
Yes, Jordan.

11:12.655 --> 11:13.963
Thanks for trying.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.217
(flames roaring)

11:18.661 --> 11:19.761
(beeps)

11:21.740 --> 11:25.517
(somber music playing)

11:37.531 --> 11:38.738
(Grace sighs)

11:52.028 --> 11:53.378
GRACE: Hey, Dave.

11:54.456 --> 11:56.089
Hello, Grace.

11:58.626 --> 12:00.093
You okay?

12:01.704 --> 12:03.012
Yeah.

12:05.708 --> 12:08.968
You know, no matter
how many people we lose here,

12:09.062 --> 12:12.230
it never seems to get
any easier, does it?

12:12.381 --> 12:13.473
I wouldn't know, actually.

12:13.549 --> 12:16.192
Never lost anyone
on a call before.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.903
Really?

12:19.055 --> 12:21.130
-In all your years on the job?
-Yeah.

12:21.149 --> 12:22.991
Guess luck's always
been on my side.

12:23.927 --> 12:25.151
Streak over, then.

12:25.228 --> 12:26.745
Well, you know,
Emergency Services,

12:26.896 --> 12:28.488
they offer counseling 24/7.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.323
Yeah, I appreciate it.
I think I'd just rather

12:30.475 --> 12:32.141
get out of here, to be honest.

12:32.143 --> 12:33.901
Do you have anybody
you can call?

12:33.979 --> 12:36.479
Oh, yeah,
my brother's in Leicester,

12:36.539 --> 12:39.257
so he'll be awake
in about six hours,
so maybe I'll FaceTime him.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.651
I mean, you...

12:41.653 --> 12:42.761
(sighs)

12:44.264 --> 12:46.839
(sighs) Why don't you,
why don't you

12:46.992 --> 12:49.917
come over for dinner tonight?

12:50.011 --> 12:52.662
Tonight? No. No, no.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.772
Couldn't possibly put you out.

12:53.848 --> 12:55.940
Well, no, you wouldn't
be putting us out.

12:56.017 --> 12:59.002
-We'd be happy to have you.
-Grace...

12:59.020 --> 13:00.503
You have enough to worry about

13:00.522 --> 13:02.171
on the home front
with a little baby.

13:02.173 --> 13:03.931
And you don't need to be
fretting about me.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.933
I'm gonna have Judd
make his potato salad.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.361
(upbeat music playing)

13:08.513 --> 13:10.513
Just grab the rest of my things.

13:10.515 --> 13:11.498
Okay.

13:12.534 --> 13:14.334
(panting)

13:17.355 --> 13:19.188
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

13:19.190 --> 13:22.358
Hey, uh, do you remember
where we kept my old fish tank?

13:22.377 --> 13:23.426
Your...

13:25.030 --> 13:26.620
TK, are we getting fish?

13:26.698 --> 13:27.764
Nope.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.978
CARLOS: Uh, what is that?

13:34.055 --> 13:36.889
That is Lou,
an alligator lizard,

13:37.042 --> 13:38.817
and our new buddy.

13:38.893 --> 13:43.196
And, uh, what is Lou doing

13:43.731 --> 13:44.471
in a to-go box?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.882
Oh, this is from lunch.

13:46.051 --> 13:48.493
I put him in here after we
dug him out from the guy's leg.

13:48.570 --> 13:49.735
What guy's leg?

13:49.812 --> 13:51.496
I was on a call today.

13:51.573 --> 13:54.740
He was buried in there
pretty good.

13:54.893 --> 13:57.076
You brought
a flesh-eating reptile
into our home?

13:57.228 --> 13:58.819
No, he wasn't eating it.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.964
He was just... hangin' out.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.916
Anyways, after we rescued him,

14:03.993 --> 14:06.402
we brought him to Pathology
to make sure he wasn't diseased.

14:06.421 --> 14:09.514
-CARLOS: Mm-hmm.
-Which he wasn't, by the way.

14:09.665 --> 14:10.907
He's adorable, isn't he?

14:10.909 --> 14:12.016
Maybe to another lizard.

14:12.168 --> 14:14.077
You're gonna love him.
You'll see.

14:14.079 --> 14:16.245
Besides, you wanted a pet.

14:16.264 --> 14:18.081
Yeah. To, you know, pet.

14:18.099 --> 14:19.749
I don't want this thing
anywhere near me.

14:19.842 --> 14:21.175
That's fine.
I'll take care of everything.

14:21.252 --> 14:24.028
I'll feed him,
I'll set up his basking lamp.

14:24.105 --> 14:25.771
You won't have to lift a finger.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.441
Good.
Because I'm afraid I'd lose it.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.368
Think your fish tank
is in the garage.

14:30.445 --> 14:32.412
Excellent.
Would you mind getting it?

14:33.689 --> 14:34.931
(sighs)

14:34.933 --> 14:37.083
And this is me
not lifting a finger.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.864
The potato salad is lovely.
Thank you, Judd.

14:43.942 --> 14:46.301
I can't help but notice
you ain't really touched it.

14:49.631 --> 14:52.390
It turns out that it's difficult
to enjoy something

14:52.541 --> 14:53.540
even as lovely as this

14:53.560 --> 14:55.226
after you've killed
a father of two.

14:55.303 --> 14:57.303
It was not your fault.

14:57.455 --> 14:58.712
That man was on the fifth floor.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.048
Grace said that whole place
was an inferno too,

15:01.067 --> 15:02.383
so nobody's gonna save him.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.402
I could have done more than

15:04.553 --> 15:06.404
march him
into a windowless tomb.

15:09.801 --> 15:12.911
That, uh, that tater salad
that you're so fond of...

15:13.896 --> 15:15.805
that ain't
actually my recipe.

15:17.142 --> 15:21.753
The fella that give it to me,
his name was Chef Parkland.

15:23.148 --> 15:24.505
He was a...

15:25.741 --> 15:27.333
He was one of my best friends...

15:27.928 --> 15:29.510
and he was a husband...

15:30.913 --> 15:33.431
and he was daddy
to a little girl.

15:33.508 --> 15:36.659
He was one of eleven

15:36.678 --> 15:40.012
incredible firefighters
that we lost at the 126.

15:40.089 --> 15:42.848
The Farm and Feed Factory
on Old Walker Road.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.275
I-I remember that.

15:45.594 --> 15:46.852
Yeah, on the drive over,

15:47.005 --> 15:49.522
my job was to look
at the facility maps

15:49.598 --> 15:51.616
and blueprints.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.201
Yet it never occurred to me

15:53.954 --> 15:55.620
that a fertilizer factory

15:55.697 --> 15:58.848
is basically a bomb
just waitin' to go off.

15:58.866 --> 16:01.876
Now, I thought that should have
been the first thing on my mind.

16:03.204 --> 16:06.464
And, uh, I tortured myself
about that for weeks.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.425
It was months, actually.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.623
How did you
forgive yourself?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.434
I don't know if I ever did.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.555
But my therapist said something

16:22.707 --> 16:25.400
that made me
feel a little better.

16:27.045 --> 16:30.321
He said,
"A hero ain't in the saves.

16:31.474 --> 16:34.158
It's in the carrying on
after a loss."

16:35.403 --> 16:36.402
GRACE: Yeah, that's right.

16:36.554 --> 16:39.205
And you're gonna
carry on too, Dave,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.724
because you are a hero, sir.

16:41.743 --> 16:44.243
No, I'm not a hero.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.087
GRACE: Yes, you are.

16:47.065 --> 16:49.048
I see what you do every day.

16:53.588 --> 16:55.421
Thank you.
(chuckles)

16:55.498 --> 16:56.997
I think I needed
to hear that tonight. Hmm.

16:57.075 --> 16:59.592
Thank you so much
for inviting me over.

16:59.668 --> 17:01.001
I think if it
wasn't for you two,

17:01.079 --> 17:02.169
I'd just be getting
sloshed off my trolley

17:02.247 --> 17:04.272
watching old
"Battlestar Galactica."

17:05.767 --> 17:08.084
I didn't understand a word
that you just said,

17:08.086 --> 17:10.177
but I do feel like maybe
we should have offered the man

17:10.196 --> 17:12.922
a little something
stronger than iced tea.

17:12.924 --> 17:15.199
You know, uh,
actually I do fancy

17:15.276 --> 17:16.993
a tipple, actually.

17:17.686 --> 17:18.611
A...

17:18.763 --> 17:20.263
Uh, your booze would be good.

17:20.281 --> 17:21.597
-JUDD: Oh!
-Yeah.

17:21.616 --> 17:24.525
-GRACE: Alright.
-Gotcha. You like bourbon?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.603
I don't really like it.
I bloody well love it!

17:27.622 --> 17:29.622
Oh. Uh-oh. Watch out.

17:29.774 --> 17:32.866
(laughter)

17:32.960 --> 17:35.611
You seem to be
in good spirits today, Owen.

17:35.613 --> 17:36.554
OWEN: Oh, I am.

17:36.631 --> 17:38.614
Watched a little movie
last night.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.117
"The Greatest Show on Earth."
Ever seen it?

17:41.135 --> 17:42.876
Uh, with Hugh Jackman, right?

17:42.896 --> 17:44.378
That's "The Greatest Showman."

17:44.455 --> 17:45.621
"The Greatest Show on Earth,"

17:45.623 --> 17:47.899
C.B. DeMille. 1952.

17:47.975 --> 17:51.127
Just happened to win
the Academy Award
for Best Picture.

17:51.129 --> 17:53.979
Two and a half hours
of glorious technicolor.

17:54.132 --> 17:58.150
And the thing is
filthy with clowns.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.304
I mean, they're like
50 of 'em in there.

18:01.322 --> 18:03.581
Jimmy Stewart doesn't even
take his clown makeup off

18:03.732 --> 18:04.974
for the whole thing.

18:04.992 --> 18:06.417
And...

18:07.829 --> 18:09.253
I loved it.

18:09.905 --> 18:12.590
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.408
I might even watch it again.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.244
So, does that sound
like someone

18:17.263 --> 18:19.079
who's suffering
from clown-o-phobia?

18:19.099 --> 18:20.506
Well, I never
formally diagnosed you.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.917
I merely suggested
that some triggering event

18:23.995 --> 18:25.752
around the concept of clowns

18:25.772 --> 18:27.346
might be at the root
of your anger issues.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.026
But it's not
because I do not have
a thing with clowns.

18:33.020 --> 18:34.854
Are you sure about that,
sonny boy?

18:34.930 --> 18:37.281
(heavy breathing)

18:40.695 --> 18:42.161
"Sonny boy"?

18:43.772 --> 18:45.331
(exhales deeply)

18:49.129 --> 18:50.186
(alarm beeping)

18:50.188 --> 18:52.004
JUDD:
Grace, make that stop.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.877
(baby babbling)

18:58.029 --> 19:00.179
(Dave speaking indistinctly)

19:01.975 --> 19:04.958
Ah! Good morning, Grace.
Did you sleep well?

19:05.036 --> 19:06.719
Uh, I did. Thank you.

19:06.871 --> 19:08.037
Oh, thank goodness.

19:08.039 --> 19:10.130
Charlie started mewling
at the crack of dawn.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.965
I was worried
she might have woken you up.

19:12.043 --> 19:15.544
Ah. Um, well,
I didn't hear any mewling.

19:15.563 --> 19:16.470
Well, you have a seat.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.138
I've got beans on toast
on the go.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.733
That'll be ready
in just a moment.

19:20.809 --> 19:21.993
(Charlie cooing)

19:22.144 --> 19:23.828
Okay. Uh...

19:23.979 --> 19:26.146
Dave, got a question for you.

19:26.224 --> 19:27.832
Yeah, of course.

19:27.983 --> 19:29.500
What are you still doing
in my house?

19:29.652 --> 19:30.835
When you went to bed
last night,

19:30.986 --> 19:32.077
Judd and I's little tipple

19:32.230 --> 19:34.063
turned into two little tipples

19:34.065 --> 19:36.657
and then three big ones
and so forth.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.584
Yeah, so...

19:38.661 --> 19:41.086
I couldn't let him
get behind the wheel
after all them tipples.

19:41.163 --> 19:43.389
So I just told him to
crash out on the couch.

19:47.261 --> 19:50.837
You know, um, you can
tell me your secret, Dave,

19:50.857 --> 19:53.766
because you have turned
our squealing little gas monster

19:53.918 --> 19:55.175
into a cooing cherub.

19:55.195 --> 19:59.088
That's just a nip of antacid.
That did the trick.

19:59.106 --> 20:01.924
What, you gave my child antacid?

20:01.926 --> 20:03.609
As in, like, grown-up antacid?

20:03.686 --> 20:05.912
Is there really such a thing
as grown-up antacid?

20:06.021 --> 20:07.705
It's just calcium carbonate,
isn't it?

20:07.782 --> 20:11.542
Also, I don't think she has gas.
I think it's just reflux.

20:11.619 --> 20:13.619
JUDD:
Girl and me here, we've been
trying to crack the crying code

20:13.713 --> 20:16.939
for, what, couple months now,
he gets it night one.

20:16.941 --> 20:18.249
It's amazing, ain't it, Grace?

20:18.325 --> 20:20.109
Uh, it's something.

20:20.127 --> 20:21.944
Yeah. You have no idea
the kindness

20:21.963 --> 20:23.279
that you've done us, man. Truly.

20:23.281 --> 20:24.613
Well, can't say there isn't

20:24.632 --> 20:26.282
a little bit
of self-interest involved.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.375
If I'm gonna be sleeping
on your couch for a week,

20:28.394 --> 20:30.453
I would like to do it in peace.

20:30.513 --> 20:33.064
-Did-did you say a week, Dave?
-Mm-hmm.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.624
Yeah, the man's got
a plumbing issue at his house.

20:35.626 --> 20:36.883
Mystery clog.

20:36.885 --> 20:37.902
No one can find it.

20:37.979 --> 20:39.795
No hot water until they do.

20:39.797 --> 20:42.481
And they didn't try
to snake it or...

20:42.633 --> 20:43.950
(scoffs) Multiple times.

20:45.303 --> 20:47.060
Well, you know,
as I was telling your husband,

20:47.154 --> 20:48.913
I don't have to stay.
I don't wanna be a burden.

20:48.990 --> 20:51.064
Don't be crazy, man.
You ain't no burden.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.416
Is he, Grace?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.503
I guess not.

21:00.334 --> 21:04.487
("Slippery People"
by Talking Heads playing)

21:04.489 --> 21:06.989
Oh! So sorry.

21:07.008 --> 21:09.249
-Oh. Yeah.
-Beg your pardon.

21:09.327 --> 21:11.619
Oh. Ran out of hot water
there at the end,

21:11.695 --> 21:13.512
so you might wanna
wait a few minutes

21:13.664 --> 21:15.273
for it to replenish.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.853
(Grace sighs)

21:20.929 --> 21:22.488
(doorknob rattles)

21:24.600 --> 21:25.992

Dave, did you bring
your own coffee?

21:37.463 --> 21:40.164
I did. French press.
Coarser grind.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.782
Okay. Because, you know,

21:41.801 --> 21:43.359
we've got plenty
of coffee in the pantry.

21:43.377 --> 21:45.878
Oh, I know. I just can't do
that freeze-dried stuff.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.347
Life is too short
for crap coffee.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.050
Sorry. No offense.

21:51.126 --> 21:53.218
Oh. None taken.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.386
Good morning, Grace.

21:54.539 --> 21:57.206
Can I offer you
some bangers and mash?

21:57.224 --> 22:00.151
Uh, I think I'm good
with cereal today.

22:00.302 --> 22:02.194
You're missing out.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.048
I could've sworn
we had some milk left.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.551
Ah, I finished
that off last night.

22:08.569 --> 22:09.643
Just before bed.

22:09.645 --> 22:10.644
A little bit of warm milk,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.221

22:34.762 --> 22:36.929
Thought I would suggest
that we carpool together,

22:37.005 --> 22:39.023
but you seem to be
running a bit behind.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.193
Uh, no, you go ahead, Dave.
I still need a minute.

22:42.344 --> 22:43.919
Nah, I'll wait and we can
take your car together.

22:43.938 --> 22:46.113
If we don't save the planet,
who will?

22:46.757 --> 22:47.990

You "Inception"-ed me.

23:01.939 --> 23:03.697
I "Inception"-ed you?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.049
Yes. Ever since you had me doing

23:05.126 --> 23:07.551
your stupid eye movement
mumbo-jumbo,

23:07.703 --> 23:10.704
I've been having nightmares
with clowns in them.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.297
-Really?
-Yes, really.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.451
You and your
little bouncing ball
sent in the clowns.

23:15.453 --> 23:17.119
I even had one
where you were a clown.

23:17.121 --> 23:18.562
It's infuriating.

23:18.714 --> 23:20.973
I'm leaving your office
with more neuroses

23:21.049 --> 23:23.049
than I had when I came in here.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.460
I think we may have
taken the cap off

23:24.462 --> 23:25.794
something in your subconscious.

23:25.813 --> 23:27.053
Well, I'm putting
the cap back on

23:27.131 --> 23:28.297
'cause things
are getting in there

23:28.299 --> 23:29.490
that weren't there before.

23:30.818 --> 23:31.817
You seem angry.

23:31.894 --> 23:33.469
I am angry.
That's the whole point.

23:33.487 --> 23:35.638
And you've got me
talking about clowns.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.824
No more clowns.

23:38.901 --> 23:43.403
Hiya, kids.
It's me, Zippy the Clown!

23:43.481 --> 23:44.997
(cheering)

23:45.149 --> 23:49.485
Now, are you ready
to meet my balloon circus?

23:49.503 --> 23:51.578
KIDS: Yeah!

23:51.597 --> 23:55.766
But first,
who's our birthday boy today?

23:55.843 --> 23:57.601
-It's me!
-Oh!

23:57.753 --> 23:59.678
And what's your name, young man?

23:59.830 --> 24:00.996
Darren!

24:00.998 --> 24:04.183
Well, happy birthday, Darren!

24:04.335 --> 24:07.186
Now, I bet you like...

24:07.338 --> 24:08.779
(gasps) ...giraffes.

24:08.856 --> 24:12.265
Giraffes are
my favorite animal.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.618
-Oh!
-(horn toots)

24:14.695 --> 24:16.412
(Zippy laughs)

24:18.015 --> 24:19.682
Okay, that is impressive.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.016
Clown did his research,

24:21.018 --> 24:22.442
Darren's favorite animal
really is a giraffe.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.219
-Aw.
-Oh!

24:24.221 --> 24:26.297
It's so good
seeing Darren laugh.

24:26.373 --> 24:27.465
He woke up
this morning in tears

24:27.541 --> 24:29.133
saying all he wanted
for his birthday

24:29.284 --> 24:30.542
was Ted to be here.

24:30.619 --> 24:32.953
Just remind Darren
that from now on,

24:33.030 --> 24:34.972
he gets two birthdays.

24:35.123 --> 24:36.882
No, I did.

24:37.034 --> 24:38.625
He'd rather have his dad.

24:38.703 --> 24:40.144
Why?

24:40.295 --> 24:41.127
(toots)

24:41.147 --> 24:44.648
Oh, that is one awful giraffe.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.542
(toots)

24:46.544 --> 24:47.818
Thank you, Zippy.

24:47.970 --> 24:49.320
But it made Darren smile.

24:49.396 --> 24:52.323
Now, before I make the hippo,

24:52.399 --> 24:55.308
I gotta do the hippo dance.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.536
-(kids cheering)
-(Zippy humming)

24:58.739 --> 25:00.414
(creaking)

25:01.408 --> 25:03.417
-Oh. Oh.
-(giggling)

25:04.486 --> 25:07.171
-(grunts)
-(kids screaming)

25:18.684 --> 25:20.976
(horn blares)

25:23.264 --> 25:26.582
Thank you for coming.
We're this way.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.584
I wanted Darren's 6th birthday
to be memorable.

25:28.602 --> 25:31.028
-Not traumatizing.
-Well, don't worry.

25:31.179 --> 25:34.106
We'll try to keep
the trauma to a mini... mum.

25:34.258 --> 25:36.516
ZIPPY: Don't worry, kids.

25:36.518 --> 25:39.352
Zippy's just fine.

25:39.430 --> 25:40.429
Cap?

25:40.447 --> 25:42.447
I don't even let
Darren play on it.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.266
My ex-husband built it.

25:44.268 --> 25:46.435
Always promised he'd add
a coat of sealant.

25:46.453 --> 25:48.787
Classic Ted, all promises.

25:48.864 --> 25:50.789
Cap, do you want us to check out
the integrity of that structure

25:50.866 --> 25:52.107
so Medical can
make an assessment?

25:52.200 --> 25:54.960
-Yes, yes, do that.
-Yes, sir. Y'all heard him.

25:55.112 --> 25:57.871
Uh, TK, Nancy,
stand by with the patient.

25:57.873 --> 25:59.372
Will do, Cap.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.059
Mommy, is Zippy gonna be okay?

26:02.286 --> 26:03.135
Oh, yes, sweetie.

26:03.454 --> 26:05.454
These firefighters
are gonna help him out

26:05.472 --> 26:08.140
because they're
very, very brave, okay?

26:08.292 --> 26:10.234
That one looks scared.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.444
Owen?

26:13.314 --> 26:13.979
Owen?

26:14.056 --> 26:16.131
-(Owen panting)
-Owen?

26:16.133 --> 26:18.483
-Owen?
-JUDD: It'll be alright, sir.
We'll get you out of there.

26:18.636 --> 26:19.318
You alright?

26:19.394 --> 26:20.894
Gee, thanks, Mr. Fireman.

26:20.971 --> 26:23.488
-That'd be... real swell.
-TOMMY: Owen?

26:23.641 --> 26:24.656
I wanna take
your blood pressure.

26:24.809 --> 26:26.125
Really, I'm...

26:26.660 --> 26:27.810
I'm alright.

26:27.812 --> 26:28.735
No, you are not alright.

26:28.813 --> 26:29.753
I just need to catch my breath.

26:29.905 --> 26:31.422
I think you're having
a panic attack.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.832
PAUL:
This wood is a rotted mess.
It's no wonder you dropped in.

26:33.984 --> 26:36.151
MARJAN:
When he did, he destabilized
the whole thing.

26:36.153 --> 26:37.820
No, I just...

26:37.838 --> 26:39.013
I just need a minute.

26:40.324 --> 26:42.007
JUDD: Chavez, you grab
the struts and cribbing.

26:42.159 --> 26:44.343
-Is it the clown?
-(gasps)

26:44.495 --> 26:47.104
Have you ever been diagnosed
with coulrophobia?

26:47.222 --> 26:48.922
Not officially.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.609
Alright.
You gonna pass out?

26:51.760 --> 26:52.851
Fall down? Vomit?

26:52.928 --> 26:54.111
I think I have it under control

26:54.262 --> 26:56.363
if I just stand still here
for a minute.

26:57.358 --> 26:59.074
Please don't make this a thing.

27:07.034 --> 27:08.533
-Everything okay, Cap?
-Yeah.

27:08.686 --> 27:10.276
Yeah, your dad
just wants to, uh,

27:10.296 --> 27:12.296
observe from back there,
you know,

27:12.373 --> 27:14.356
wants to see the whole picture.

your driver's license,

I'm gonna need something

a little more official
than that.

Fine. My name's Ted.

Hey, Juliana.
Hey, Darren.

Dad?

this was the only way
you'd let me come.

It's like Mrs. Doubtfire,
but with a clown.

28:03.090 --> 28:05.832
Ted, we agreed, two birthdays.

28:05.910 --> 28:06.850
It's not the same, Juliana.

Ted, you idiot.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.613
I know.
I got what I deserve.

28:28.766 --> 28:30.615
I screwed up so many times.

28:30.768 --> 28:31.934
I'm so sorry, Juliana.

28:31.952 --> 28:33.785
-Is he gonna be okay?
-I think so.

28:33.862 --> 28:35.954
They'll take a better look
at him at the hospital.

28:36.106 --> 28:36.880
Can I go with him?

28:37.049 --> 28:39.883
That's not up to me,
little buddy.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.627
-DARREN: Mom, please.
-Oh. Uh...

28:42.780 --> 28:44.704
Y'all are free
to ride with us if you want.

28:44.782 --> 28:46.265
(horn toots)

28:47.634 --> 28:48.559
Okay, We'll go with him.

28:48.635 --> 28:50.168
Yay!

28:50.320 --> 28:51.520
JULIANA: Come on, baby.

What's that?

29:15.070 --> 29:16.812
Eggs for breakfast tomorrow.

29:16.830 --> 29:19.815
I also got some peppers,
some onion,

a new season of "Grand Designs"?

29:40.337 --> 29:42.154
Uh, no.

No, I didn't.

Want to watch it tonight?

Unless you're busy,

29:47.936 --> 29:49.845
and then I can just
stick with the magazines.

29:49.863 --> 29:52.998
No, I'm good.
I'm easy. I'm free.

Why don't we, uh...

Why don't we do that now?

Do what now?

I'm sorry,
I didn't wanna scare you.

So how long
is he planning on staying?

31:12.204 --> 31:16.022
I guess until
his plumbing situation
is figured out.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.875
What kind of plumbing situation?

31:17.951 --> 31:21.786
He says he's got some sort of
mystery clog in his pipes.

31:21.863 --> 31:25.273
Oh, I remember the last time
we had a mystery clog.

31:25.292 --> 31:27.776
It ended six months later
with a jackhammer

31:27.794 --> 31:29.535
taking up the kitchen floor.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.828
Did you say six months?

31:30.981 --> 31:32.447
Mm-hmm.
And an extra week

31:32.466 --> 31:34.975
to put the floor
back together again.

31:35.895 --> 31:39.062
Listen, Dave is nice, okay?

31:39.214 --> 31:41.289
He's nice
and he's good with the baby.

31:41.308 --> 31:43.066
And we've been saving on gas

31:43.068 --> 31:45.310
'cause we've been
carpooling to work.

31:45.387 --> 31:46.645
(clears throat) Okay.

31:46.797 --> 31:48.888
So, uh, you mean to tell me
that this man is there

31:48.908 --> 31:50.407
when you wake up in the morning

31:50.558 --> 31:54.077
and next to you
on the drive in to work

31:54.229 --> 31:57.247
and sitting beside you
all day long at a desk

31:57.324 --> 32:00.809
and then back in the car
with you on the way back home?

32:00.827 --> 32:02.753
Okay, Tom,
you know, it's not as bad

32:02.829 --> 32:04.570
as you making it sound
right now.

32:04.572 --> 32:07.699
Oh, oh, no.
Then why are you here right now

32:07.776 --> 32:09.668
still in your work clothes?

32:09.744 --> 32:10.986
Is it? Oh... (laughs)

32:11.004 --> 32:12.837
Is he waiting for you
in the car?

32:12.914 --> 32:14.348
(sighs) Tommy.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.225
No, I Uber-ed here, okay?

32:18.753 --> 32:19.770
I just let him take the car.

32:19.888 --> 32:21.846
-Gracie.
-I couldn't do it.

32:21.923 --> 32:23.848
He sings show tunes
comin' and goin'.

32:23.925 --> 32:26.851
And I couldn't do
"Surrey with the Fringe on Top"
tonight.

32:26.928 --> 32:28.503
Okay, Grace.

32:28.505 --> 32:31.022
You need to kick
that man off your couch
and outta your house.

32:31.175 --> 32:34.267
Yeah, Tommy, that's...
I would love to do that,

32:34.361 --> 32:36.954
but I can't just kick him out
onto the street, T.

32:37.105 --> 32:38.680
No, kick him out into a hotel.

32:38.699 --> 32:40.082
Okay, listen.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.851
Just hear me out, okay?

32:42.853 --> 32:44.869
The real test
of Christian charity

32:44.946 --> 32:46.871
isn't when it's easy, right?

32:47.024 --> 32:48.190
It's when it's hard.

32:48.192 --> 32:50.709
Oh, don't do that.
Look at you and Julius.

32:50.861 --> 32:52.285
-Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Okay?

32:52.362 --> 32:57.048
You put all that anger and pain
and bad blood to the side

32:57.201 --> 33:00.035
to welcome an unwanted guest
into your home.

33:00.037 --> 33:02.887
The unwanted guest
that cleans,

33:03.040 --> 33:04.464
helps my girls
with long division,

33:04.558 --> 33:07.275
and is out right now
with them at a movie.

33:08.729 --> 33:10.045
He cleans, Tommy?

33:10.047 --> 33:12.063
Mm-hmm.
My point being that Julius

33:12.140 --> 33:14.658
isn't exactly taxing
my Christian charity.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.051
And, listen,
I'll tell you something else.

33:16.069 --> 33:17.977
-Listen to me. Girl.
-Sure. Yep. Yep.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.480
You are not Jesus.
Okay?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.649
You need to relax your standards
right here just a little bit.

33:23.669 --> 33:24.743
-(knock on door)
-Oh, Tommy...

33:24.895 --> 33:26.652
-Yep?
-Howdy, y'all.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.747
Oh, hey, Juddie.

33:28.899 --> 33:30.732
Oh, that was fast, sweetheart.

33:30.734 --> 33:32.901
Yeah, there was no traffic.
There's no rush.

33:32.994 --> 33:35.086
I just need, like,
ten minutes.

33:35.163 --> 33:36.238
(Judd sighs)

33:36.256 --> 33:39.016
Uh, where's Charlie?

33:39.910 --> 33:41.435
She's with Uncle Dave.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.764
(Grace sighs)
Let's go.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.357
-(mouths)
JUDD: Go? Ah...

33:50.087 --> 33:51.194
Dave?

33:51.846 --> 33:53.679
Ah! You're home.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.757
Dave, where's my child?

33:55.759 --> 33:58.593
Sleeping peacefully in the crib.
I just put her down.

33:58.612 --> 33:59.444
Oh, so she's fine.

33:59.521 --> 34:00.853
Oh, she loads better than fine.

34:00.931 --> 34:02.113
What does that mean?

34:02.266 --> 34:04.690
My friends,
I have some big news.

34:04.768 --> 34:05.950
As of one hour ago,

34:06.027 --> 34:08.754
Charlie is officially bipedal.

34:10.774 --> 34:13.108
Okay. So what you're
saying is our daughter

34:13.126 --> 34:15.460
took her first steps
and we missed it?

34:15.462 --> 34:18.446
Oh, no. Not to worry.
You didn't miss a thing.

34:18.448 --> 34:21.558
I caught
each and every moment

34:21.709 --> 34:25.062
of Charlie's
first vertical foray on video.

34:26.807 --> 34:28.440
Uncle Dave to the rescue.

34:29.643 --> 34:31.735
DAVE (over phone):
<i> Come to me, Charlie.</i>

34:31.886 --> 34:34.053
<i> Charlie, come to Uncle Dave.</i>

34:34.073 --> 34:36.147
<i> You wanna come towards</i>
<i> Uncle Dave?</i>

34:36.300 --> 34:37.982
<i> Wait, wait.</i>
<i> Let me get a good angle.</i>

34:38.059 --> 34:39.725
<i> Let me get a good angle</i>
<i> for Mum and Dad.</i>

34:39.745 --> 34:41.486
<i> Oh, yes! You're doing it.</i>

34:41.563 --> 34:43.988
(gasps)
<i> Oh, you're really doing it!</i>

34:44.141 --> 34:45.640
<i> Good girl!</i>

34:45.642 --> 34:47.417
<i> That's fantastic!</i>

34:47.494 --> 34:49.811
<i> Good girl.</i>
<i> Come to me, Charlie.</i>

34:49.830 --> 34:51.679
<i>Come to me, come to Uncle Dave.</i>

34:51.681 --> 34:53.006
<i> What a moment.</i>

34:54.000 --> 34:56.093
It seems that,
in my excitement,

34:56.244 --> 34:59.179
I may have accidentally
flipped the camera.

35:00.324 --> 35:02.974
Well, that's unfortunate,
isn't it?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.227
Isn't it?

35:06.163 --> 35:09.356
(whimsical music playing)

35:15.689 --> 35:18.240
-He's gotta go, don't he?
-Yeah, I think it's time.

35:21.695 --> 35:23.411
So what are you gonna tell him?

35:30.778 --> 35:34.256
DR. PATT:
So, Owen, how would you like
to start today's session?

35:35.950 --> 35:37.300
With an apology.

35:38.879 --> 35:41.054
Turns out
I'm terrified of clowns.

35:42.123 --> 35:44.883
I see.
And what changed your mind?

35:44.959 --> 35:47.185
A close encounter with one.

35:47.629 --> 35:48.979
I, uh...

35:48.981 --> 35:53.057
I am a chloraphobe.
I'm chlorophobic.

35:53.134 --> 35:54.818
Coulrophobic.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.653
Chlorophobic is a fear
of chlorine.

35:56.804 --> 35:59.805
Oh, well, can't say
I'm a fan of that either.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.883
You should be
proud of yourself, Owen.

36:01.902 --> 36:04.161
It takes a lot of courage
to admit something like that.

36:04.237 --> 36:05.645
Thank you.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.389
DR. PATT:
And have you been able
to give any more thought

36:07.391 --> 36:10.417
to what might be
the cause of this phobia?

36:11.578 --> 36:12.711
Yes.

36:15.081 --> 36:17.156
In fact, I think I know
exactly where it came from.

36:17.234 --> 36:20.068
-DR. PATT: Is that so?
-Mm-hmm.

36:20.070 --> 36:21.753
So I told you that
in one of my nightmares,

36:21.905 --> 36:23.238
you were a clown?

36:23.256 --> 36:24.514
DR. PATT: Yes, I recall.

36:24.591 --> 36:26.558
Yeah, but I didn't
tell you what you said.

36:27.669 --> 36:29.594
You called me "sonny boy."

36:29.746 --> 36:33.356
And that phrase has
some significance for you?

36:33.508 --> 36:36.568
There's only one person
in the world that's ever
called me sonny boy.

36:37.845 --> 36:39.011
My father.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.755
You've never
mentioned him in here.

36:40.757 --> 36:41.698
What can you tell me about him?

36:41.849 --> 36:42.699
Not much.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.184
Haven't seen the man
since I was 12.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.520
And are you comfortable
sharing what happened

36:47.597 --> 36:48.613
when you were 12?

36:48.765 --> 36:50.932
He abandoned the family.

36:50.951 --> 36:54.711
Do you remember how you felt
when your family separated?

36:55.772 --> 36:57.214
Shame.

36:58.533 --> 36:59.549
Terror.

37:00.702 --> 37:02.052
Rage.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.890
Am I to assume
that you never got the chance

37:07.041 --> 37:08.516
to tell your father
how you felt?

37:09.877 --> 37:11.311
No, no, I...

37:13.123 --> 37:14.981
I don't even think
I was aware of it.

37:15.809 --> 37:18.050
And, um...

37:18.070 --> 37:20.737
I've never talked
to anybody about it until...

37:21.889 --> 37:23.240
just this moment.

37:23.391 --> 37:26.326
And-and how does that feel
to finally say it out loud?

37:27.895 --> 37:30.580
Some relief, I guess.

37:30.657 --> 37:34.509
Frankly, not as...
as much as I would like.

37:34.511 --> 37:37.236
DR. PATT:
And why do you think that is?

37:37.256 --> 37:40.298
Well, saying it out loud
doesn't change what happened.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.334
Doesn't change
the fact that I...

37:43.411 --> 37:46.096
don't have any relationship
with him to this day.

37:47.324 --> 37:48.823
DR. PATT: Well...

37:48.825 --> 37:52.227
Then maybe I'm not the person
you need to say it out loud to.

37:58.001 --> 38:01.027
-BREE: Good night, Grace.
-You too, Bree. Drive safe.

38:06.726 --> 38:08.434
(sighs)

38:08.453 --> 38:10.436
Okay, Lord...

38:10.455 --> 38:12.998
I pray You forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.776
(sighs) I just ask that You give

38:16.795 --> 38:19.945
Dave the strength
to receive this

38:19.965 --> 38:22.299
and to be able
to stand on his own two feet.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.052
Okay.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.624
(clears throat)

38:31.701 --> 38:34.369
Hey. Um, you about ready?

38:34.371 --> 38:35.127
Oh, yeah.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.146
Uh, almost finished, Grace.

38:36.297 --> 38:37.814
Just give me one moment.

38:37.965 --> 38:39.632
Yeah, yeah, sure.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.109
You take your time.

38:44.397 --> 38:46.990
(sighs) Actually, Dave, um...

38:47.826 --> 38:49.534
I think we should talk.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.999
Honestly, um, I'm glad
to hear you say that because...

38:57.502 --> 38:58.560
I do too.

38:58.578 --> 39:00.244
-Oh, you do?
-Yeah.

39:00.397 --> 39:02.230
I want to preface this by saying

39:02.232 --> 39:06.676
that I am deeply grateful
for the hospitality

39:06.828 --> 39:08.236
that you and your family
have given me.

39:08.254 --> 39:10.405
I know you're coming
from a good place

39:10.423 --> 39:13.350
and it's been
a wonderful experience,

39:13.426 --> 39:17.020
but it does feel
a little bit...

39:17.764 --> 39:19.338
smothering?

39:19.358 --> 39:21.006
-Smothering?
-Well, no.

39:21.084 --> 39:22.584
That's-that's
not the right word.

39:22.602 --> 39:24.752
Uh, what I mean is, um,

39:24.754 --> 39:26.437
the family togetherness

39:26.514 --> 39:29.532
is-is just
a little bit suffocating.

39:29.609 --> 39:30.850
-Yes.
-Okay.

39:30.927 --> 39:32.351
Yeah, that-that means
the same thing.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.854
Right. What I'm trying to say is
I crossed the Atlantic

39:34.948 --> 39:37.189
to escape
my family togetherness.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.282
So really, it is on me.

39:38.435 --> 39:39.859
And I should have turned down

39:39.936 --> 39:42.212
that initial invitation
to dinner.

39:42.363 --> 39:43.380
But I didn't because I thought

39:43.607 --> 39:45.940
that you didn't
want me to say no.

39:45.959 --> 39:47.867
And then Judd
so graciously offered me

39:47.944 --> 39:49.110
the space on the couch.

39:49.279 --> 39:50.612
And I didn't wish to disappoint
him in the same way

39:50.630 --> 39:52.555
I don't wanna
disappoint you, 'cause...

39:52.632 --> 39:53.723
Argh!

39:53.875 --> 39:56.951
Just, I can't take anymore.

39:56.970 --> 39:59.729
Sorry... if that came out wrong.

40:00.506 --> 40:01.881
Uh, no.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.733
How could it? Um...

40:05.553 --> 40:10.148
Listen, Dave, I was just
trying to be of some service.

40:10.224 --> 40:14.485
You lost a caller
and you were hurting, so I...

40:14.638 --> 40:15.829
DAVE: Yeah, I did.

40:16.990 --> 40:19.490
But then I found out
it wasn't my fault.

40:19.567 --> 40:21.918
Yeah, yeah.
No, of course, it wasn't.

40:22.069 --> 40:23.327
No, I mean,
it literally wasn't my fault.

40:23.496 --> 40:26.572
Turns out the flat owners
were doing some remodeling,

40:26.650 --> 40:28.091
and they didn't put
the permits in,

40:28.242 --> 40:30.593
and they didn't take
those new papers to the city.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.488
And so the blueprints
weren't in the system.

40:33.490 --> 40:37.583
So greed is to blame, not me.

40:37.661 --> 40:40.770
Oh. So then
when did you find this out?

40:40.847 --> 40:42.346
Oh, like the, the day after.

40:42.499 --> 40:44.849
So why didn't you say anything?

40:44.926 --> 40:47.777
Because you and Judd
seemed like

40:47.854 --> 40:50.989
you were enjoying
having a project.

40:52.266 --> 40:54.676
Uh, I didn't know
how to bring it up anyway.

40:54.694 --> 40:55.952
Well, it's out there now,
isn't it?

40:56.103 --> 40:57.120
That boil has been lanced.

40:57.530 --> 41:00.348
So I think I'm just gonna go
back to my place tonight.

41:00.366 --> 41:02.125
But hold on. I'm-I'm sorry.

41:02.202 --> 41:03.701
So what about
your plumbing issue?

41:03.870 --> 41:06.629
Well, I think I can get by
without a little hot water
for now.

41:06.706 --> 41:08.631
In fact, I like
my showers quite brisk.

41:08.783 --> 41:11.042
Oh. Okay.

41:11.118 --> 41:12.193
I-I mean, I just
wouldn't have known

41:12.212 --> 41:14.696
the way you ran
through our hot water.

41:14.714 --> 41:17.031
Well, you might wanna
look into upgrading,

41:17.050 --> 41:19.200
uh, because I suspect
you have a tiny tank.

41:19.293 --> 41:21.202
Tsk. We will do that.

41:21.221 --> 41:22.036
Yeah.

41:22.038 --> 41:24.296
You're not angry, are you?

41:24.316 --> 41:27.233
No, I'm-I'm not angry at all.

41:27.819 --> 41:28.968
No hard feelings?

41:29.045 --> 41:30.528
No, no hard feelings.

41:30.563 --> 41:33.156
Ah! That is why they call
her Amazing Grace,

41:33.307 --> 41:35.307
ladies and gentlemen.

41:35.327 --> 41:36.159
Uh...

41:36.310 --> 41:37.719
Have a lovely evening.

41:37.721 --> 41:39.387
You too, Dave.

41:39.389 --> 41:40.330
Yes.

41:45.395 --> 41:48.246
That was a lot of strength
You gave him, Lord.

41:48.322 --> 41:51.674
Like a whole lot.
(laughs)

41:51.751 --> 41:53.218
I appreciate you, though.

41:54.754 --> 41:56.095
(sighs)

42:03.170 --> 42:05.188
CARLOS: Oh. Hey.

42:06.358 --> 42:07.265
Were we robbed?

42:07.417 --> 42:10.276
No, I was looking for Lou.

42:10.603 --> 42:11.986
Oh.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.113
I got him.

42:14.607 --> 42:16.032
You got him?

42:16.442 --> 42:17.200
Is he...

42:17.277 --> 42:19.702
What? No, I didn't kill him.

42:19.929 --> 42:22.764
-He's right in there.
-Oh. Lou!

42:22.782 --> 42:24.541
I found him by the desk lamp.

42:24.617 --> 42:26.125
I guess he was basking.

42:27.604 --> 42:28.953
Oh, my God, babe.

42:29.030 --> 42:30.938
But... I thought you hated him.

42:30.940 --> 42:32.257
CARLOS: I do.

42:32.867 --> 42:34.133
But...

42:35.703 --> 42:36.553
I love you.

42:36.704 --> 42:38.462
And I love
how big your heart is

42:38.615 --> 42:39.764
for bringing in strays.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.225
I love you too.

42:43.711 --> 42:45.061
(sighs)

42:46.398 --> 42:48.289
We should bring him
to the greenbelt

42:48.291 --> 42:49.715
and set him free, right?

42:49.793 --> 42:51.475
I'm begging you.

42:51.552 --> 42:53.027
-Okay.
-Yeah.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.446
-(dialing)
-(exhales)

42:56.482 --> 42:58.491
(line ringing)

43:01.304 --> 43:02.912
-WOMAN (over phone):<i> Hello?</i>
-Yes, um...

43:03.064 --> 43:05.230
I'm-I'm trying
to reach Walter Strand.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.066
WOMAN:<i> Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
<i> He's not available.</i>

43:07.085 --> 43:09.752
<i> Is there a message</i>
<i> I can give him?</i>

43:13.258 --> 43:15.133
<i> Is there a message?</i>
