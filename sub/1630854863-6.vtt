WEBVTT

00:12.153 --> 00:14.259
You're going to make
ten times as much as you do
now?

00:14.259 --> 00:16.226
Yeah. Yeah.
Sounds too good to be true.

00:16.226 --> 00:17.814
So how did you
go?

00:17.814 --> 00:19.160
He's in, I reckon.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.472
I can arrange
anything you want.

00:20.472 --> 00:21.576
I'm like Sam's lieutenant.

00:27.237 --> 00:28.687
Ah, fuck. Look out.
Here she comes.

00:28.687 --> 00:30.240
Charlie's Angels.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.761
Apparently Johnny went
from doorman out in Parramatta

00:33.761 --> 00:36.143
to owning three clubs in
the Cross in a heartbeat.

00:36.143 --> 00:37.489
Maybe he won lotto.

00:38.110 --> 00:40.285
Liz Doyle. She
made contact with you yet?

00:40.285 --> 00:42.045
She's looking at me.

00:42.770 --> 00:45.462
She's also pretty interested
in you, and your mates.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.533
- Where's Sammy?
- He's busy.

00:49.846 --> 00:51.434
Stop!

00:51.641 --> 00:53.436
Sam, people rely on us now.

00:53.436 --> 00:55.024
I need you here.

00:55.024 --> 00:56.128
I used to really think

00:56.128 --> 00:57.785
he was one of the best
people I know,

00:57.785 --> 00:59.200
and now he's just a
fucking cockhead.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.685
People respect you Sam,
because you're not like this.

01:05.034 --> 01:07.968
You know when I was a kid I
would've followed you anywhere.

01:56.326 --> 01:57.603
Pick up.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.919
Sam.

02:06.578 --> 02:08.131
Hey bro, was just
coming to see you.

02:08.131 --> 02:09.029
What are you doing?

02:09.029 --> 02:10.375
You want to go get
something to eat?

02:10.375 --> 02:11.238
Hit the gym after.

02:11.238 --> 02:12.687
No man, fuck off!

02:12.687 --> 02:15.207
Right oh, I was just seeing
if you wanted to.

02:42.269 --> 02:43.546
Get off the bloody road.

02:47.308 --> 02:48.930
You don't own the joint,
mate!

03:44.883 --> 03:45.780
Hold on a minute.

03:46.816 --> 03:48.128
Hang on.

03:53.719 --> 03:56.550
Jesus Christ!
Come on man.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.345
I can't go through
this again, please.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.248
Here you are.

04:05.248 --> 04:07.216
Take it.

04:14.706 --> 04:17.191
He's a different
person when he's on it.

04:17.191 --> 04:18.848
He scares me.

04:18.848 --> 04:20.781
Oh fuck. He kicked
this guy's windscreen in

04:20.781 --> 04:22.748
just because he honked
his horn at him.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.854
- He ever off it?
- I don't know.

04:24.854 --> 04:25.751
Did you go to the apartment?

04:25.889 --> 04:27.615
I did, yeah. I knocked.
He didn't answer.

04:27.615 --> 04:28.789
And how hard you'd
fucking knock?

04:28.789 --> 04:30.411
Listen, I like the guy.

04:30.411 --> 04:32.344
Okay, I do,
but I'm not banging on

04:32.344 --> 04:35.105
any more doors or approaching
him when he's like this.

04:35.105 --> 04:38.143
I'll get flogged.
Fuck that.

04:38.454 --> 04:41.353
It's okay.
I get it.

04:41.353 --> 04:43.183
I'm worried about him, John.

04:43.183 --> 04:47.083
I'm really worried about him.
It's not going to end well.

04:48.118 --> 04:49.189
I'll sort it.

04:59.129 --> 05:02.029

All right mate, relax.

05:52.044 --> 05:54.081
I'm helping her
pay her bills.

05:54.081 --> 05:55.600
No touching.
It's the fucking rules.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.466
All right. Hey Dave, relax.
Sit down.

05:59.466 --> 06:01.295
Sit down. Have a drink.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.262
It's on me.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.954
Come on,
sit here.

06:05.955 --> 06:08.958
Okay, rum and coke.
Drink of champions.

06:09.096 --> 06:11.857
You don't get two punchy
on the rum now do we?

06:19.658 --> 06:21.177
So what do you reckon?

06:22.385 --> 06:24.214
She a big bitch.

06:25.008 --> 06:26.838
She got a cock?

06:28.771 --> 06:30.462
I mean she, she's hot.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.534
Look at her, I'd pot her.

06:37.538 --> 06:39.644
You know her.

06:40.783 --> 06:43.579
- Yeah.
- Ahh.

06:43.579 --> 06:44.545
Simone.

06:44.545 --> 06:47.445
- Simon?
- Simone.

06:47.445 --> 06:50.896
Oh, oh, right, Simone.

06:50.896 --> 06:52.726
Yeah.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.557
I'm only pulling your leg.

07:00.147 --> 07:01.942
Good on you.

07:02.563 --> 07:05.877
Nah, fuck, good on you.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.579
Like he's off
his fucking head.

07:18.579 --> 07:19.994
You understand
what I'm saying?

07:19.994 --> 07:21.686
Like he doesn't
give a fuck about anybody,

07:21.686 --> 07:23.481
about the rules, nothing.

07:23.619 --> 07:24.861
He just walked in
off the street,

07:24.861 --> 07:27.692
fucking off his chops and
took the gear and the cash.

07:28.451 --> 07:30.177
Is that for me?

07:31.420 --> 07:32.869
Yeah, sure,
but I'm telling you,

07:32.869 --> 07:34.837
if you don't get this
fixed by next week,

07:34.837 --> 07:36.321
you're not going
to see half this.

07:38.772 --> 07:40.429
I'm not fucking
making this up, Ezra.

07:40.429 --> 07:42.154
Something has to be done.

07:42.603 --> 07:44.191
To who?

07:46.331 --> 07:48.126
Go on, say his name.

07:49.714 --> 07:51.681
He's going to
fucking ruin us.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.476
Us?

07:57.169 --> 07:59.896
Okay. What do we do?

08:01.622 --> 08:03.348
Fucking hell, Ezra!

08:04.038 --> 08:06.040
If I have to sort this
fucking shit myself,

08:06.040 --> 08:07.110
why do I need you?

08:07.283 --> 08:08.664
Osmon, we're going to
put the kettle on, mate.

08:09.561 --> 08:11.632
How are those chickens
going down there?

08:12.806 --> 08:15.325
Okay, thanks Joey.

08:15.325 --> 08:16.810
Did you know that the black
one with the white thing?

08:16.810 --> 08:18.156
That's, that's the only cockerel.

08:18.156 --> 08:19.260
Did you see him though?

08:19.260 --> 08:21.090
He's got that funny,
cute little head.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.782
- He's serious?
- Yeah.

08:23.782 --> 08:25.853
Who the fuck do you
think you are talking to?

08:25.853 --> 08:27.683
You can't talk
to him like that.

08:27.683 --> 08:29.339
Make no mistake
about it, mate.

08:29.339 --> 08:30.617
He'll have someone
cut your throat,

08:30.617 --> 08:33.343
and he won't lose a
wink of fucking sleep.

08:33.343 --> 08:34.931
Now he's given you
the real estate,

08:34.931 --> 08:37.451
the keys, the authority to a
business that makes more money

08:37.451 --> 08:39.384
than anything we do here.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.145
But it's your business Joey.

08:42.836 --> 08:44.285
Remember that?

08:45.114 --> 08:46.598
Yeah, you want to
straighten this out.

08:46.598 --> 08:49.739
You know what you got to do?
Go talk to his brother.

09:10.139 --> 09:11.381
I don't give
a flying fuck

09:11.381 --> 09:13.004
what you got or
how you sell it.

09:13.004 --> 09:14.488
I've only got one rule.

09:17.422 --> 09:19.148
Whenever I want something
you hand it over.

09:19.148 --> 09:21.461
Whenever I need cash,
give me as much as I want.

09:24.118 --> 09:25.948
How much is that, Sam?

09:25.948 --> 09:28.433
Is there like a,
you know, a cap?

09:28.433 --> 09:30.573
As much as I want,
means as much as I want.

09:30.573 --> 09:31.540
There's no cap.

09:31.540 --> 09:33.645
You don't like it,
you go fuck yourself.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.271
How's Joey Romano
going to react?

09:39.271 --> 09:41.584
Joey Romano can go
fuck himself.

10:00.361 --> 10:01.984
Oi!

10:03.710 --> 10:05.297
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

10:05.297 --> 10:07.576
I've got the green
light from Sam.

10:07.576 --> 10:09.647
- Did you?
- Yeah.

10:10.786 --> 10:12.408
Oh, you want me to piss off?

10:12.408 --> 10:13.789
- Yes please.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:30.115 --> 10:31.738
What are we doing here?

10:32.359 --> 10:33.912
Sam Ibrahim!

10:35.017 --> 10:37.537
- Yeah?
- He's lost his fucking mind.

10:38.227 --> 10:40.229
He's letting drug dealers run
all over the fucking street.

10:40.229 --> 10:41.679
Fucking my business.

10:42.714 --> 10:44.682
And what do you want
us to do about it?

10:45.855 --> 10:47.167
Get him off
the fucking street.

10:47.408 --> 10:49.825
Shut him down. Fuck him off.
I don't know.

10:50.411 --> 10:51.792
This is fucking unfair.

10:51.792 --> 10:54.450
I'm not sure unfair is a word
that you should be using

10:54.450 --> 10:57.349
given the enterprise that
you're in and with whom you assoc...

10:57.349 --> 10:58.834
I'm doing exactly what I've
been fucking told to do.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.698
That prick does whatever
the fuck he wants,

11:00.698 --> 11:02.976
and no one's lifting a finger.

11:03.735 --> 11:06.427
Right, well, we'll note your
grievances in your file.

11:06.427 --> 11:08.464
Hey, he is a total
fucking liability.

11:08.464 --> 11:10.811
He will fuck all of us,
you included.

11:12.123 --> 11:14.539
So to clarify, you would
like us to step away

11:14.539 --> 11:17.611
from our regular duties to help
you with a personal matter?

11:20.131 --> 11:21.753
Fucking hell.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.237
How much?

11:24.411 --> 11:27.310
Definitely a few notches
above the usual, I'd say.

11:27.310 --> 11:30.831
If you want a
priority escalation.

11:31.729 --> 11:33.282
Fuck!

11:43.568 --> 11:45.363
Are you missing Perth?

11:46.398 --> 11:49.091
Yeah. I miss Penny
and the girls.

11:49.091 --> 11:51.369
Shannon and Elwyn?

11:51.645 --> 11:53.958
- Erin.
- Ah.

11:53.958 --> 11:55.649
You close.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.034
- How about yourself?
- What do you mean?

12:03.139 --> 12:06.695
- Anyone you miss?
- No.

12:07.178 --> 12:11.285
Well, my mum, but whenever
I'm there we fight like stink.

12:11.285 --> 12:13.494
We're much better at distance.

12:14.323 --> 12:17.913
They're not even trying to
conceal what they're doing.

12:18.603 --> 12:20.640
Ah, there's not
a cop in sight.

12:21.537 --> 12:23.332
Should we get to work?

12:32.997 --> 12:35.206
Jack the price up by 75,
all right?

12:35.206 --> 12:36.828
I won't get no customers, bro.

12:36.828 --> 12:39.313
- You'll get 'em. Just do it.
- All right.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.837
Hey, what the fuck?
I got a right to be here.

12:45.837 --> 12:47.356
- I paid...
- Kings Cross Taskforce, mate.

12:47.356 --> 12:49.047
You want to come take a
step inside the vehicle?

12:49.047 --> 12:50.186
No, I fucking wouldn't.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.981
Yeah, it was more of an
instruction than a request.

12:51.981 --> 12:53.534
- Let's go.
- Hey Luke! Leave him.

12:53.534 --> 12:56.537
We have an urgent message.
We have to return to base.

12:56.537 --> 12:57.953
Urgent!?

13:01.059 --> 13:05.167
The legislation passed the
upper house this evening,

13:05.167 --> 13:08.239
and the letters patent
have been delivered.

13:08.757 --> 13:10.793
Which means we've
got a green light, people.

13:10.793 --> 13:12.243
Thunderbirds are Go!

13:14.486 --> 13:18.352
We are permitted to carry
firearms and, here it is...

13:18.352 --> 13:21.010
We have been "conferred
with the powers

13:21.010 --> 13:24.013
"of a constable of the New
South Wales Police Service".

13:24.013 --> 13:25.187
And listen to this...

13:25.187 --> 13:28.915
"Lying to or misleading the
Commission is an offence

13:28.915 --> 13:32.608
"carrying a custodial
sentence of 18 months jail".

13:33.954 --> 13:35.059
Anyone got any champagne?

13:35.059 --> 13:37.164
When do the
hearings start, Doug?

13:37.164 --> 13:39.373
At the Commissioner's
pleasure, Doyle.

13:39.373 --> 13:40.616
So you better make sure

13:40.616 --> 13:43.032
you got all your
ducks in a row ASAP.

13:44.378 --> 13:45.759
Oh my God.

13:46.587 --> 13:47.899
Congratulations Liz.

13:53.146 --> 13:55.596
Get in.

13:56.390 --> 13:57.771
Fuck me!

14:01.499 --> 14:02.845
Who the fuck
are youse?

14:17.135 --> 14:18.654
Fuck me, you busted my skull.

14:18.654 --> 14:19.931
What happened to our deal?

14:20.656 --> 14:22.865
Tien, how you doing?

14:22.865 --> 14:24.384
I see you employing
your own runners,

14:24.384 --> 14:26.489
and from what I hear,
they're kicking up to Sam.

14:26.489 --> 14:27.628
No, no, no, no.

14:27.836 --> 14:29.734
All right. I spoke to him, he
went for it. He's gone rogue.

14:29.734 --> 14:31.771
He's copping protection from
dealers that were already there.

14:31.771 --> 14:32.944
That's not what we discussed.

14:32.944 --> 14:34.981
The runners were
supposed to be my guys,

14:34.981 --> 14:36.016
and you kick up to me.

14:36.016 --> 14:37.846
You took our plan
and cut me out.

14:37.846 --> 14:39.779
No, no, no, I didn't. I didn't
take nothing. All right.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.676
I was going to come
speak to ya...

14:40.676 --> 14:43.299
What did you think
would happen? Hmm?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.543
I was always going
to find out.

14:46.544 --> 14:48.926
Did you think, what?

14:49.478 --> 14:52.377
Because I'm a woman that
there'll be no consequence.

14:52.377 --> 14:54.310
Please, please. It's just Sam,
he can't be reasoned with.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.485
He listens to no one.
He's a fucking loose cannon.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.107
Put an eye out.

14:59.143 --> 15:00.972
Please, please. Look, I know
there's something coming.

15:00.972 --> 15:02.180
All right,
it's the Police Taskforce

15:02.180 --> 15:03.561
or some shit like that.

15:03.561 --> 15:04.665
All right, they're going
after all the crims

15:04.665 --> 15:06.357
and the corrupt jacks
paying them off.

15:07.289 --> 15:08.704
It's going to
change everything.

15:08.704 --> 15:11.017
I swear to fucking God,
I spoke to these people.

15:11.017 --> 15:12.397
A woman.

15:12.777 --> 15:14.537
A woman.

15:15.918 --> 15:17.471
All right.

15:19.715 --> 15:22.062
She's got a hard on
for the corrupt jacks.

15:22.891 --> 15:25.031
We all got bigger
problems than this.

15:26.756 --> 15:28.517
No. Wait.

15:28.517 --> 15:31.140
Hey, wait, wait, wait
wait. Please, please.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.764
Go on.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.490
Fuck off.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.221
Give us a lift
back to the Cross?

15:55.716 --> 15:57.857
I don't think we should be
sticking our noses down there,

15:57.857 --> 15:59.410
if it's all about to
get turned upside down.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.274
Why do we give a fuck huh?

16:01.274 --> 16:02.896
We're not paying the cops.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.725
Fuck this lady.
She's not looking at us.

16:04.725 --> 16:06.520
We'll draw attention
to ourselves.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.315
Listen, if this thing's
going to happen

16:08.315 --> 16:10.421
then the Cross is wide open.
We don't need to sneak in.

16:10.421 --> 16:11.353
We need to take it.

16:11.353 --> 16:12.319
It's a mistake.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.769
We need to wait
until it settles.

16:13.769 --> 16:14.804
See who's still standing.

16:14.804 --> 16:16.703
And what?
Give them a head start?

16:16.703 --> 16:19.637
We go in hard and
we put our flag up.

16:44.558 --> 16:46.802
Fuck.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.092
What the fuck do you want?

17:01.713 --> 17:04.371
I just want to give you
some free advice.

17:05.165 --> 17:07.719
You need to pull
your head in, mate.

17:09.618 --> 17:11.689
Listen, you keep
pulling that shit

17:11.689 --> 17:13.415
like you did on
the Lasers job.

17:13.415 --> 17:15.555
You're going to get
fucking locked up.

17:19.421 --> 17:23.873
Sam. It's time to get off the
gear and clean yourself up.

17:32.503 --> 17:33.607
Hopefully your brother

17:33.607 --> 17:34.677
can talk some fucking
sense into you,

17:34.677 --> 17:35.678
or maybe your mum.

17:35.678 --> 17:37.163
Don't mention
my family, cock.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.475
Get over yourself
for fuck sake.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.443
You're a fucking disgrace
to your family.

17:43.686 --> 17:45.723
You got a family too, yeah?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.731
That a threat?

17:55.284 --> 17:56.768
See this?

17:57.838 --> 17:59.840
That's my family.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.636
And there are way more of
us than there are of you,

18:02.636 --> 18:04.052
and we get to carry
these things around.

18:04.052 --> 18:06.468
So you ever mention
my family again,

18:06.468 --> 18:08.125
and you're a
fucking dead man.

18:14.234 --> 18:16.340
I'm going to have a line.
You want one?

18:48.613 --> 18:50.960
Hey, mate, how's it going?

19:10.083 --> 19:13.914
Hey, why the fuck
you keep paging me for?

19:16.986 --> 19:18.747
You okay?

19:18.747 --> 19:20.956
Yeah, what do you want,
what the fuck do you want?

19:21.370 --> 19:25.133
Let's, um,
let's talk outside, huh?

19:34.487 --> 19:36.075
Come on.

19:39.699 --> 19:42.943
- Where you been?
- Where have I been?

19:42.943 --> 19:45.463
Fucking nowhere,
been here the whole time.

19:45.463 --> 19:47.810
You understand what's going
on at the moment, right?

19:47.810 --> 19:49.018
With the Royal Commission?

19:50.158 --> 19:51.711
They're here to bring
down this whole place,

19:51.711 --> 19:53.678
the jacks, the gear,
all of it,

19:53.678 --> 19:55.370
and the way you are acting

19:55.370 --> 19:57.475
is making it really hard
to go unnoticed, Sam.

19:57.475 --> 19:58.959
Yes, sir.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.789
This is heat
we don't need.

20:02.342 --> 20:05.104
That's what you wanted
to talk to me about, huh?

20:05.104 --> 20:07.416
You just want to pull my head
in, so it doesn't affect you.

20:07.416 --> 20:08.314
Are you fucking
listening to me?

20:08.314 --> 20:09.487
- Yeah.
- But you don't think,

20:09.660 --> 20:12.456
do you actually not see it or
are you just too fucking high?

20:14.285 --> 20:18.220
Look around, the new heads,
the new cops,

20:18.220 --> 20:20.222
we're being watched and you
keep going the way you're
going,

20:20.222 --> 20:22.983
you're going to fuck up
everything that we've built.

20:22.983 --> 20:24.399
"We've?"

20:27.195 --> 20:30.336
You're only here
because of me.

20:38.896 --> 20:41.830
If you find my brother,
tell him I want to see him.

I'll get you a beer, matey.

24:36.823 --> 24:40.171
Here you go, fella.
Where you been?

24:40.171 --> 24:42.311
Eh, where you been?

24:45.936 --> 24:49.077
How the hell
are you doing?

24:50.492 --> 24:53.771
Here he is,
public enemy number one.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.912
Doyle, O'Neill.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.845
You want to hop
in for a second, Bryan?

24:59.328 --> 25:01.745
I would've thought they'd
given you an office.

25:01.745 --> 25:04.230
We're not exactly conducting
interviews in the back seat,

25:04.230 --> 25:05.196
we're just booking them.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.406
I gathered, but yeah, talk
to me anytime you want.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.752
Well, how about now?

25:08.752 --> 25:09.615
I'm flat out today,

25:09.787 --> 25:11.893
but so I can give you
guys what you need,

25:11.893 --> 25:12.790
what are you after?

25:15.068 --> 25:17.726
That should be pretty obvious
given the press we've got.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.211
Corruption, yeah, I get that.

25:20.211 --> 25:22.766
I don't know if I've got
anything to add to that.

25:22.766 --> 25:24.768
I mean, beyond the small understanding

25:24.768 --> 25:27.046
we have with local crooks
to elicit information.

25:27.046 --> 25:31.360
And how are they conducted,
the misunderstandings?

25:32.085 --> 25:34.191
They give us information
and we don't book them

25:34.191 --> 25:36.918
for every small fuck up,
we keep them in play.

25:37.539 --> 25:40.473
It's the Cross, mate, it's
how it's always been done.

25:42.337 --> 25:43.821
Is that what you're after?

25:43.821 --> 25:45.927
You're definitely getting
warmer, Detective Crellan.

25:45.927 --> 25:49.378
You call me to set up
a formal interview.

25:50.483 --> 25:51.829
I don't know
how I can help you

25:51.829 --> 25:54.660
beyond what I've told you,
but sure.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.489
You know, you should be aware,

25:56.489 --> 25:58.802
that we've been watching and
listening for a long time

25:58.802 --> 26:00.044
and your name
has been mentioned

26:00.044 --> 26:02.012
in dispatches
from time to time.

26:04.117 --> 26:05.015
Good-o.

26:06.775 --> 26:07.569
Ladies.

26:10.745 --> 26:13.195
How do you get that cocky?

26:13.195 --> 26:14.714
Oh, when you've had your
hand in the cookie jar

26:14.714 --> 26:17.165
your whole life, and no one's
kicked you up the arse for it.

26:40.637 --> 26:42.708
- Cloudy now.
- Here he comes.

26:42.708 --> 26:43.709
Look at that.

26:44.157 --> 26:45.987
- Hey, Bryan.
- Tones.

26:45.987 --> 26:47.126
All right?

26:47.575 --> 26:49.335
- We've got a problem.
- Oh yeah?

26:49.335 --> 26:52.441
Doyle, she's fucking all
over me and just told me,

26:52.441 --> 26:54.202
that she has been for a while.

26:55.203 --> 26:56.894
She's really fucking tall, right?

26:58.137 --> 27:00.035
Mate, she's a dog with a bone

27:00.035 --> 27:02.486
and we need to do
something about it.

27:02.486 --> 27:03.694
I like tall people.

27:03.694 --> 27:06.145
Fuck's sake, Ezra, the
target is us coppers,

27:07.042 --> 27:09.113
but also everyone
that's assoc...

27:09.631 --> 27:11.426
Hello, darling.

27:11.426 --> 27:13.911
I'll call you back, I'll
call you back, sweetheart.

27:13.911 --> 27:15.361
All right, love you too, bye.

27:16.638 --> 27:19.538
The target is us coppers,

27:19.538 --> 27:21.885
but also everyone we're
associated with,

27:21.885 --> 27:24.612
and that means you,
all of you.

27:24.612 --> 27:27.753
So you need to fucking lean
on your political connections

27:27.753 --> 27:30.100
and make her go the fuck away.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.105
We are not associates.

27:39.316 --> 27:40.144
Okay.

27:43.251 --> 27:45.046
She's not happy, is he?

27:45.046 --> 27:47.151
I know.

27:53.123 --> 27:55.470
He's going to get a ticket
if he drives like that.

28:02.511 --> 28:05.342
Well, for what it's
worth, I think he's wrong.

28:05.342 --> 28:08.379
I think this is all about the
cops and who's getting a feed.

28:08.379 --> 28:10.727
I think that's who they want.

28:10.727 --> 28:13.557
I don't think it's got
anything to fucking do with us.

28:16.249 --> 28:18.113
Yeah, you might be right.

28:23.222 --> 28:28.123
If I choose to, I can take
this market from you by force.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.262
By force, you say?

28:29.262 --> 28:31.230
I have the numbers.

28:31.230 --> 28:33.853
You didn't let me
into your boys' club,

28:33.853 --> 28:35.303
you kept me out of the Cross.

28:37.167 --> 28:39.721
If you want a life
after the investigation,

28:39.721 --> 28:41.550
it will only happen
if you cut ties

28:41.550 --> 28:43.035
with the ones who
can take you down,

28:43.035 --> 28:45.106
the ones you've
partnered with.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.144
Look, why don't you just
go back to Cabramatta?

28:49.144 --> 28:51.146
I'm not from Cabramatta.

28:51.491 --> 28:52.216
Really?

28:52.216 --> 28:54.287
I'm from Vietnam.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.807
Very different.

29:04.712 --> 29:06.196
Mama.

29:07.749 --> 29:09.130
Where is she?

29:09.130 --> 29:10.165
Mama.

29:22.695 --> 29:26.147
I'm doing this for us,
all of us.

29:29.288 --> 29:30.703
Quick, go to the bedroom.

29:31.808 --> 29:32.843
No, no, no, lock the door.

29:54.831 --> 29:56.246
Where's Mum?

29:59.249 --> 30:00.250
Mama!

30:01.389 --> 30:02.873
Come out.

30:07.429 --> 30:08.361
Sam.

30:11.502 --> 30:13.021
What the fuck
you scaring her for?

30:13.850 --> 30:15.748
Shat yourself, huh?

30:15.748 --> 30:17.854
Was a bit loud for ya?

30:18.440 --> 30:20.201
Cute vest.

30:20.857 --> 30:22.513
Does it come in men's?

30:30.556 --> 30:32.282
What are you doing?

30:34.387 --> 30:35.630
You used to laugh
at clowns like this,

30:35.630 --> 30:37.252
now you're one of them?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.322
Ooh, fucking hell!

31:55.468 --> 31:57.470
Don't you know
who this is?

31:58.299 --> 32:00.542
You know who that is?
Yeah.

32:01.129 --> 32:02.751
All right, in you go boys.

32:03.407 --> 32:06.134
Here we go.
Here we go boys. Come on.

32:06.134 --> 32:08.827
Let's have a good time,
we're here to have a good time.

32:09.379 --> 32:11.070
Cheers, brother.

32:59.394 --> 33:02.225
Back again,
couldn't help yourself, eh?

33:02.225 --> 33:03.743
Yeah.

33:06.712 --> 33:08.093
How long's she got?

33:10.164 --> 33:11.510
About an hour.

33:11.510 --> 33:14.340
Yeah, well, I'd give
her an early mark, mate.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.446
Not with this bunch.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.760
I don't want to see you
defending your girlfriend

33:20.760 --> 33:23.315
or whatever, against this lot.

33:24.385 --> 33:26.421
They're all fucking pigs.

33:28.389 --> 33:30.770
Take this,
come see me tomorrow.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.807
I've got something for you.

33:34.084 --> 33:36.086
Thank you, brother.

33:55.692 --> 33:58.591
Ezra, you told me it
was my problem, to fix it.

33:58.591 --> 34:01.042
I can't, he's joined
a fucking bikie gang.

34:01.042 --> 34:03.424
There's millions of them,
they're fucking everywhere,

34:03.424 --> 34:05.702
and they're doing whatever
the fuck they want,

34:05.702 --> 34:07.669
- and he's the one...
- No, no, no.

34:07.669 --> 34:09.533
...that's fucking
green-lighting the whole thing.

34:09.533 --> 34:14.090
No, wait, wait, Sam dressed
head to toe in black leather.

34:14.090 --> 34:15.332
That's quite a turn on.

34:15.332 --> 34:17.300
I mean, no, no, no, that's it.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.233
Ezra this is not fucking funny,
you think this is funny?

34:19.233 --> 34:20.889
- It's fucking chaos.
- Hey, ssh!

34:20.889 --> 34:22.374
And it's only
going to get worse.

34:22.374 --> 34:23.892
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

34:23.892 --> 34:26.171
Keep your fucking
voice down, Joey.

34:27.379 --> 34:29.139
- Quiet.
- All right.

34:35.283 --> 34:38.804
All right, we all know
what has to happen.

34:38.804 --> 34:41.531
If this wasn't him, if
this was anybody else,

34:41.531 --> 34:43.567
they'd already
have been dealt with.

34:43.567 --> 34:45.880
It's quite a call
you're making though.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.193
Ah, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm not making a fucking...

34:48.193 --> 34:50.436
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
mate, ssh!

34:50.436 --> 34:51.437
- No, fuck that.
- Ssh!

34:51.610 --> 34:52.714
I'm not making a fucking
call and I'm not doing...

34:52.714 --> 34:54.785
That's why I came
to see you, Ezra.

34:54.785 --> 34:56.787
- Shazza.
- Ezra.

34:56.787 --> 34:59.652
Do you have
carrot juice?

34:59.652 --> 35:00.515
We do.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.379
And can you leave
the pulp in?

35:02.379 --> 35:03.932
Thank you, Shazza.

35:06.142 --> 35:07.384
Ezra, please.

35:08.351 --> 35:10.180
You've got to do something

35:10.180 --> 35:12.389
or we may as well
both fucking retire.

35:24.091 --> 35:27.473
I don't know, it's a lot
of men loyal to him,

35:27.473 --> 35:28.578
a lot of fucking nutters.

35:28.578 --> 35:30.028
Yeah.

35:30.028 --> 35:32.720
- Could be mayhem.
- Thanks, Shaz.

35:34.342 --> 35:36.068
It's not him
I'm worried about.

35:36.068 --> 35:38.001
It's his fucking brother.

35:43.006 --> 35:44.456
I love you.

35:46.423 --> 35:49.047
It's that
hard to say, is it?

35:49.047 --> 35:50.393
No.

35:52.981 --> 35:54.880
No one else here
though is there?

35:57.503 --> 35:59.298
Hey, it's okay.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.163
I love you too.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.694
I'm going to get
you out of here.

36:16.867 --> 36:18.559
Out of where?

36:18.559 --> 36:20.078
This life.

36:21.009 --> 36:23.011
I don't want to share you,

36:23.667 --> 36:25.428
I don't want you
fucking anyone else.

37:05.985 --> 37:08.160
This place
is fucking horrible.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.817
Right.

37:10.404 --> 37:11.715
Can we come in?

37:11.715 --> 37:13.476
Yeah, yeah. If you want.

37:20.759 --> 37:21.553
All right?

37:21.553 --> 37:22.416
Right.

37:25.073 --> 37:26.592
Uh, what's all this about?

37:29.008 --> 37:31.321
So he's a, uh...

37:31.528 --> 37:33.047
A bikie now?

37:33.634 --> 37:35.532
Yeah. Black Flag.

37:35.532 --> 37:37.085
Fuck's sake.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.297
You want a coffee? Cake?
Something?

37:41.297 --> 37:42.884
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:42.884 --> 37:43.678
No?

37:43.678 --> 37:44.541
No, no, no.

37:44.541 --> 37:46.164
- Sit down?
- Yep.

37:47.717 --> 37:49.132
This is...

37:49.995 --> 37:51.479
...gorgeous, Johnny.

37:52.308 --> 37:54.033
Really?

37:56.967 --> 38:00.074
He's hurting business, John.

38:00.626 --> 38:02.766
Ours, yours, everyone's.

38:03.733 --> 38:05.113
It's not good.

38:07.392 --> 38:09.359
I'm going to
ask you, honestly.

38:11.154 --> 38:13.156
Why do you think
he's behaving this way?

38:14.951 --> 38:16.435
Sam is Sam.

38:17.056 --> 38:18.541
Does what he wants.

38:20.128 --> 38:21.682
But see,

38:21.682 --> 38:23.787
I know you know the truth

38:24.340 --> 38:26.894
and you are smart enough
to know how this ends.

38:26.894 --> 38:28.378
I don't know what you mean.

38:28.378 --> 38:29.793
The coke.

38:30.656 --> 38:33.003
He's off his fucking tree.
He's out of control,

38:33.003 --> 38:36.179
and it's dangerous.
Right?

38:36.179 --> 38:38.837
For everyone, including himself.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.426
And if he doesn't stop.

38:44.912 --> 38:47.984
And he's not going
to stop by himself, is he?

38:47.984 --> 38:50.504
If you stop wiping his arse,
he's going to end up in jail.

38:52.437 --> 38:54.784
That might be the
best thing for him.

38:54.784 --> 38:56.993
Give him a chance
to clean himself up.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.963
- You done?
- Hey?

39:01.963 --> 39:03.310
Both of you, are you finished?

39:03.310 --> 39:04.863
Yeah.

39:05.726 --> 39:07.797
My brother is my brother.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.697
His battles are my battles.

39:12.077 --> 39:14.769
That means, if you make
a move against him,

39:15.908 --> 39:17.703
you make a move against me.

39:19.326 --> 39:20.879
You understand?

39:23.744 --> 39:26.333
- Well, here we are then.
- Here we are.

39:34.893 --> 39:36.826
You need to consider this.

39:36.826 --> 39:39.587
For him, and for yourself.

39:41.693 --> 39:43.419
Because he don't give a fuck.

42:05.388 --> 42:07.252
What do you reckon?

42:07.252 --> 42:09.150
I don't know.

42:09.150 --> 42:10.358
It's fucking risky.

42:13.154 --> 42:14.708
Look, they won't be back tonight.

42:14.708 --> 42:16.054
We can hit 'em now.

42:16.054 --> 42:17.918
Right through there,
that window.

42:19.989 --> 42:20.817
Nah, fuck that.

42:20.921 --> 42:22.440
I'm not robbing drugs
from these guys.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.165
It's not drugs, it's cash.

42:26.823 --> 42:29.377
The drugs are there.
The cash is there.

42:29.619 --> 42:31.207
Do you know that?

42:31.207 --> 42:34.659
Look, I take the drugs
from there for the switch.

42:34.659 --> 42:36.315
So the cash is there too.

42:36.315 --> 42:37.524
Got it?

42:39.871 --> 42:40.906
Cash?

42:40.906 --> 42:43.426
Yes, fucking cash. Ugh.

42:46.774 --> 42:48.327
Think about it.

42:48.466 --> 42:52.159
Me and you. We're in
the same boat, yeah?

42:53.160 --> 42:55.093
Fuck, I can't even
wipe my arse

42:55.093 --> 42:57.716
without asking Hamish's
permission.

42:57.958 --> 43:01.030
He's got his hand in my
pocket for every earn I make.

43:02.514 --> 43:05.344
This one's fucking mine.
This one's ours, yeah?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.450
Huh?

43:07.761 --> 43:09.521
We can do whatever we want.

43:10.177 --> 43:13.318
It's in there.
On a silver platter.

43:13.318 --> 43:16.010
You little fucking beauty.

43:17.391 --> 43:21.119
Um, Simone,
the girl I'm seeing.

43:21.913 --> 43:23.708
Simon.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.298
I, I'm in love with her.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.028
Okay. That's great mate. I'm
really fucking happy for ya.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.651
Why the fuck are you
telling me this now?

43:35.651 --> 43:37.894
Well, 'cause she's on the
hammer and I want to get her clean,

43:37.894 --> 43:39.378
get her out.

43:39.896 --> 43:42.071
I can move out of
Gran's place.

43:42.071 --> 43:43.831
Get us a place of our own.

43:44.832 --> 43:46.420
Johnny,

43:46.765 --> 43:48.698
he doesn't know any of this.

43:50.010 --> 43:51.943
Doesn't know about Simone.

43:53.392 --> 43:55.463
I can't take her anywhere
with the boys.

43:56.361 --> 43:58.536
Can't take her to dinner.
Can't take her anywhere.

43:58.536 --> 44:00.227
They'd laugh at me.

44:01.262 --> 44:03.644
Laugh at her.
Be a joke.

44:03.644 --> 44:04.887
Hey.

44:06.785 --> 44:12.791
This, is your chance
to get her out of it.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.011
Hey no, we don't need that.

44:26.011 --> 44:28.117
Never leave home without it.

44:30.015 --> 44:31.672
Come on.

45:04.981 --> 45:06.500
Shh, shh.

45:06.500 --> 45:07.984
Fuck it.

45:19.927 --> 45:21.239
Jesus.

45:22.758 --> 45:26.451
Go look over there.
I can't see shit.

45:47.472 --> 45:49.888
Go! Jesus!

45:49.888 --> 45:51.441
Go!

46:07.043 --> 46:08.976
Go, go, go, go, go.

46:11.151 --> 46:13.015
I can't believe you
fucking shot him!

46:13.015 --> 46:14.430
What the fuck was
I supposed to do?

46:14.430 --> 46:16.052
You said he wouldn't
be back tonight.

46:16.052 --> 46:17.157
I was wrong!

46:17.157 --> 46:18.399
We're fucked.
Do you know that?

46:18.399 --> 46:19.642
- We're fucked.
- We're fine.

46:19.642 --> 46:21.368
I think I got him in
the leg. We'll be fine.

46:21.368 --> 46:23.301
We're not fine! You didn't
shoot him in the legs.

46:23.301 --> 46:25.061
You shot him in the neck!

46:25.821 --> 46:28.064
Fuck! Fuck!

46:43.390 --> 46:45.599
He just lost too much blood.

46:47.497 --> 46:49.120
Who was it?

46:49.120 --> 46:51.122
They were in balaclavas.

46:51.122 --> 46:52.710
One of them had a limp.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.366
I've seen it before.

46:54.366 --> 46:55.851
A Black Flag.

46:55.851 --> 46:57.369
I know him too.

46:58.129 --> 47:01.511
Ibrahim.
He's a Black Flag now.

47:37.513 --> 47:38.825
It's John.

47:39.895 --> 47:41.551
You know who this is.

47:43.036 --> 47:45.141
Yeah, I know who this is.

47:45.141 --> 47:47.074
What do you want?
I'm busy.

47:47.074 --> 47:49.559
Your brother
came at us tonight.

47:50.457 --> 47:51.527
What are you talking about?

47:51.527 --> 47:52.977
We're going to
come after you.

47:52.977 --> 47:54.737
All of you.

47:56.152 --> 47:58.016
Well, you know where
to find us.

48:46.858 --> 48:48.860
Is this all we have?

48:48.860 --> 48:50.586
Boys are
clearing the street.

48:53.485 --> 48:54.728
Where the fuck's Dave?

48:54.728 --> 48:56.764
I don't know.

51:12.797 --> 51:14.695
Shit, hey.
Everyone's here tonight.

51:14.695 --> 51:17.388
Evening fellas.
It's good timing.

51:17.388 --> 51:19.597
Could have been here
a few minutes ago.

51:19.597 --> 51:22.876
CBD Drug Squad, my friend.
Hands behind your back.

51:22.876 --> 51:24.222
For fuckin' what?

51:24.222 --> 51:27.363
Jesus! Could be
for a lot of things.

51:27.363 --> 51:29.503
This time it's for
distribution and facilitation

51:29.503 --> 51:31.264
of a commercial
amount of cocaine.

51:32.541 --> 51:34.543
Go fuck yourself, Pete.

51:34.543 --> 51:36.614
Throw him in the car.
Make it hurt.

51:36.614 --> 51:37.373
Let's go mate.

51:37.373 --> 51:39.065
Hey fellas. Just...
