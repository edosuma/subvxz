WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:05.806
>> CAITLYN: Candis!

00:05.806 --> 00:06.807
>> CANDIS: Tonight on the

00:06.807 --> 00:08.042
season finale of I Am Cait...

00:08.042 --> 00:09.043
>> CAITLYN: I love Candis.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.044
She is always willing to go have

00:10.044 --> 00:11.045
some fun.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.046
>> COURTNEY: If you two kiss

00:12.046 --> 00:13.047
on the lips...

00:13.047 --> 00:14.048
>> KIP: So if you guys kiss,

00:14.048 --> 00:15.049
she'll sing.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.151
>> COURTNEY: ...she'll sing.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.152
(Ella laughs)

00:18.152 --> 00:19.220
(laughter)

00:19.220 --> 00:21.055
>> ELLA: Just looking at my dad,

00:21.055 --> 00:23.757
I just feel my heart jumping.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.758
You know, I was almost getting

00:24.758 --> 00:25.759
emancipated.

00:25.759 --> 00:26.760
>> PETER: It would be your loss.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.761
You did...

00:27.761 --> 00:30.431
>> ELLA: It almost was yours.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.765
>> CANDIS: "Presidential hopeful

00:31.765 --> 00:33.734
Ted Cruz opposes equality for

00:33.734 --> 00:35.603
transgender people."

00:35.603 --> 00:36.970
>> KATE: You're in a position to

00:36.970 --> 00:39.173
actually change things.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.208
>> CAITLYN: Maybe the best thing

00:40.208 --> 00:41.209
to do is go to Houston, take a

00:41.209 --> 00:42.210
look at it.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.711
>> KATE: Uh, that could mean

00:43.711 --> 00:45.379
arrest.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.447
>> CAITLYN: There it is.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.681
That's the church.

00:47.681 --> 00:51.319
>> JENNY: I'm petrified.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.320
(crickets chirping)

00:52.320 --> 00:53.321
>> KRIS: Hi. Wow!

00:53.321 --> 00:54.155
>> CAITLYN: Nice purse, baby!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.022
>> KRIS: You clean up nice!

00:55.022 --> 00:55.856
>> CAITLYN: Well, thank you,

00:55.856 --> 00:56.857
baby.

00:56.857 --> 00:57.625
>> JENNY: A delight to see you

00:57.625 --> 00:58.626
again.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.393
>> KRIS: Hey. Oh, my God, if you

00:59.393 --> 01:00.261
dance with me again, I'd be so

01:00.261 --> 01:01.195
excited.

01:01.195 --> 01:01.995
>> JENNY: Yeah, oh, my, we had

01:01.995 --> 01:02.996
fun.

01:02.996 --> 01:03.797
>> CAITLYN: Cheers, baby.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.798
>> KRIS: Cheers.

01:04.798 --> 01:05.633
>> JENNY: We wish you a Merry

01:05.633 --> 01:06.634
Christmas.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.468
>> CAITLYN: Cheers! Cheers!

01:07.468 --> 01:08.302
>> ELLA: Is this Kris's first

01:08.302 --> 01:09.303
girls' night?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.138
>> CAITLYN: We have a tradition

01:10.138 --> 01:10.971
at girls' night.

01:10.971 --> 01:11.805
To get in, you have to be voted

01:11.805 --> 01:12.806
on by the board.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.807
>> KRIS: I'm screwed.

01:13.807 --> 01:14.808
(laughter)

01:14.808 --> 01:15.809
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.810
So, a raise of hands, should we

01:16.810 --> 01:17.811
vote her in?

01:17.811 --> 01:18.812
>> KRIS: Please vote for me!

01:18.812 --> 01:19.647
>> CAITLYN: Just raise your

01:19.647 --> 01:20.648
hand.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.649
>> JENNY: Absolutely!

01:21.649 --> 01:22.583
>> CAITLYN: You actually get an

01:22.583 --> 01:24.152
official girls' night bracelet.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.153
>> KRIS: Aw! Thanks, guys.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.154
>> CAITLYN: You're voted in.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.155
I know, I know.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.156
>> KRIS: Thank you.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.190
I feel very honored.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.191
So cool.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.692
>> CAITLYN: Anyway, next on

01:31.692 --> 01:34.027
Caitlyn's world adventures is a

01:34.027 --> 01:35.028
ski trip to Mammoth.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.029
(quiet gasp)

01:36.029 --> 01:37.030
>> CANDIS: I've never skied.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.031
I've always wanted to learn how

01:38.031 --> 01:39.032
to ski.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.033
>> CAITLYN: Perfect.

01:40.033 --> 01:40.834
>> ELLA: I grew up skiing, so I

01:40.834 --> 01:41.669
have some... I have some

01:41.669 --> 01:42.670
background.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.504
I might need to get used to it

01:43.504 --> 01:44.505
again.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.339
>> CAITLYN: Okay, good!

01:45.339 --> 01:46.340
>> KATE: I will make you cocoa.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.310
(laughter)

01:59.253 --> 02:00.388
>> ELLA: Hi. How are you?

02:00.388 --> 02:01.389
>> CAITLYN: Hi, Peter.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.390
>> ELLA: My dad, Peter.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.224
>> PETER: Thank you so much.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.225
>> CANDIS: Peter, hi.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.193
How are you?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.026
>> CAITLYN: Hello, babe!

02:06.026 --> 02:06.994
>> PETER: A pleasure.

02:06.994 --> 02:07.961
>> ELLA: I ended up meeting Cait

02:07.961 --> 02:09.096
through Ronda, Cait's best

02:09.096 --> 02:11.399
friend, slash assistant.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.400
>> RONDA: So, guys, I don't

02:12.400 --> 02:13.767
think you've all met her, but

02:13.767 --> 02:14.902
this is Ella.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.337
She's a dear friend of mine for

02:16.337 --> 02:18.105
many years.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.673
>> ELLA: I grew up with Ronda.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.810
My dad and her were "friends."

02:22.810 --> 02:24.011
(laughter)

02:24.011 --> 02:25.679
>> PETER: I want to thank you

02:25.679 --> 02:27.047
from the bottom of my heart.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.216
You just opened up so many

02:28.216 --> 02:30.117
doors, not only for my daughter,

02:30.117 --> 02:31.118
but for many others.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.119
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate that.

02:32.119 --> 02:32.953
>> PETER: I really appreciate

02:32.953 --> 02:33.954
it.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.788
When she became who she is, she

02:34.788 --> 02:37.358
became more confident, more

02:37.358 --> 02:39.560
happy in her skin.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.561
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's good.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.395
>> CANDIS: It's important for

02:41.395 --> 02:43.531
people to see trans kids that

02:43.531 --> 02:44.932
have amazing, supportive

02:44.932 --> 02:46.534
fathers, so, I mean, that's

02:46.534 --> 02:47.535
really great...

02:47.535 --> 02:48.536
>> PETER: Thank you so much.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.370
>> CANDIS: ...that you've been

02:49.370 --> 02:50.371
that way.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.239
>> PETER: People ask me, "How

02:51.239 --> 02:52.240
did you do it?"

02:52.240 --> 02:53.541
I go, "Well, it's your kid.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.108
You shut the door and let it be

02:55.108 --> 02:56.109
dark, or you open it and let the

02:56.109 --> 02:57.110
light shine in."

02:57.110 --> 02:58.111
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

02:58.111 --> 02:58.946
>> PETER: It's as simple as

02:58.946 --> 02:59.947
that.

02:59.947 --> 03:00.981
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

03:00.981 --> 03:01.749
>> PETER: I mean, what're you

03:01.749 --> 03:02.616
gonna do, abandon?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.017
You love that child regardless.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.018
>> CANDIS: And now she's...

03:05.018 --> 03:08.256
>> PETER: I'm blessed.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.257
(sighs heavily)

03:09.257 --> 03:10.258
>> ELLA: My relationship with my

03:10.258 --> 03:11.459
dad.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.460
I've just kind of closed off

03:12.460 --> 03:14.528
myself from him.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.497
Transitioning-- it was a long

03:16.497 --> 03:18.732
process and, um, my dad wasn't

03:18.732 --> 03:22.169
very accepting at that time.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.271
>> PETER: It was really crazy

03:23.271 --> 03:24.272
when she went through her

03:24.272 --> 03:25.273
trans...

03:25.273 --> 03:26.274
(stammering)

03:26.274 --> 03:27.275
>> ELLA: Transition.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.409
>> PETER: Transition.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.410
I have clients for 28 years...

03:29.410 --> 03:30.411
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.412
>> PETER: ...that go, "How's

03:31.412 --> 03:32.413
your son?"

03:32.413 --> 03:33.414
Yeah.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.948
(Candis laughs)

03:34.948 --> 03:35.883
>> PETER: And, um, you know, I'm

03:35.883 --> 03:38.018
telling you, um, from my

03:38.018 --> 03:39.019
feedback, it's-it's... they're

03:39.019 --> 03:40.020
accepting of her being my

03:40.020 --> 03:41.021
daughter.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.022
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.023
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.892
>> PETER: But, uh, and I'm...

03:44.892 --> 03:46.159
and I'm an advocate, you know.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.828
I'm-I'm right...

03:47.828 --> 03:48.962
I've got all your backs.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.398
>> ELLA: I do have an accepting

03:50.398 --> 03:52.666
father now, and I'm grateful for

03:52.666 --> 03:55.168
that, but, um, it was kind of

03:55.168 --> 03:57.371
hard to watch him, um, play that

03:57.371 --> 03:58.372
role when he never...

03:58.372 --> 03:59.907
He didn't...

03:59.907 --> 04:01.509
He played another role for a

04:01.509 --> 04:04.478
very long time.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.148
>> CAITLYN: It's a rainbow,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.149
baby.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.819
>> PETER: And we're all in it.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.755
(birds chirping)

04:14.755 --> 04:16.690
>> CAITLYN: Let's go, guys!

04:16.690 --> 04:17.691
>> CANDIS: Yes!

04:17.691 --> 04:18.692
>> CAITLYN: Let's move it!

04:18.692 --> 04:19.693
>> CANDIS: Wow.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.528
I feel like I'm in a hobbit

04:20.528 --> 04:21.529
house.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.530
(Caitlyn chuckles)

04:22.530 --> 04:23.531
>> CAITLYN: And the road trip

04:23.531 --> 04:24.732
continues!

04:24.732 --> 04:25.733
I'm taking 'em skiing.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.468
It's too bad Chandi and, also,

04:27.468 --> 04:28.802
Zackary can't make it.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.571
Jenny Boylan and Kate Bornstein

04:30.571 --> 04:31.805
are gonna meet us up in Mammoth,

04:31.805 --> 04:32.973
so trip's gonna be a lot of

04:32.973 --> 04:33.974
fun.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.776
Plus, I get to ski. Not bad.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.777
It was great meeting your dad.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.078
>> CANDIS: It was great.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.648
>> CAITLYN: He was the perfect

04:40.648 --> 04:41.982
father.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.018
>> ELLA: Um, to be honest, um,

04:45.018 --> 04:47.721
I kind of felt like he glorified

04:47.721 --> 04:50.358
himself in some ways, because he

04:50.358 --> 04:51.359
never really seemed to be there

04:51.359 --> 04:52.360
for my transition.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.227
We kind of... kind of

04:54.227 --> 04:55.396
sugarcoated over the fact that

04:55.396 --> 04:57.665
it was like war.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.133
I almost got emancipated from

05:00.133 --> 05:02.870
him, and then, all of a sudden,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.972
when it was right for him, he

05:04.972 --> 05:07.074
decided to take the title of

05:07.074 --> 05:09.410
the... the hero dad.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.278
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.780
Have you talked to your dad

05:12.780 --> 05:14.114
about your feelings?

05:14.114 --> 05:18.386
>> ELLA: I think I'm, um, scared

05:18.386 --> 05:20.253
of facing him.

05:20.253 --> 05:24.024
It definitely is kind of a

05:24.024 --> 05:25.493
sensitive territory.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.495
I think I've just cut those

05:27.495 --> 05:28.496
emotions off.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.497
>> CANDIS: He needs to know how

05:29.497 --> 05:30.498
you feel.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.499
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.500
>> CANDIS: 'Cause that's the

05:32.500 --> 05:33.567
only way you can repair your

05:33.567 --> 05:34.568
side of things.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.569
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.570
>> CANDIS: And move on.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.539
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.550
>> CANDIS: Okay, I've always

05:49.550 --> 05:50.884
wanted to do this.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.086
I'm just letting you guys know.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.087
>> CAITLYN: I love Candis.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.923
One, she's a good friend.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.025
Two, she is always willing to go

05:58.025 --> 05:59.259
have some fun.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.561
Go, Candis!

06:00.561 --> 06:02.062
Let's rock and roll.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.697
>> SINGER: * Hey, I'm strung

06:03.697 --> 06:04.698
out... *

06:04.698 --> 06:07.435
>> ELLA: Woo-hoo!

06:07.435 --> 06:08.135
(Courtney chuckles)

06:08.135 --> 06:10.137
>> COURTNEY: Go!

06:10.137 --> 06:11.271
>> SINGER: * Hey, I'm strung

06:11.271 --> 06:12.339
out... *

06:12.339 --> 06:14.307
>> CANDIS: Twisting, twisting.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.713
(groans, laughs)

06:19.713 --> 06:21.449
>> SINGER: * Is it time to find

06:21.449 --> 06:23.684
The way for me? *

06:23.684 --> 06:25.318
(whoops)

06:25.318 --> 06:27.855
(groans, giggles)

06:27.855 --> 06:31.525
>> CAITLYN: Come on, Candis!

06:31.525 --> 06:32.960
Turn it in!

06:32.960 --> 06:34.928
(Candis chuckles)

06:36.697 --> 06:37.598
>> COURTNEY: Where's, um, Jenny

06:37.598 --> 06:38.599
and Kate?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.467
>> CAITLYN: Uh, unfortunately,

06:39.467 --> 06:40.267
their flight cancelled in L.A.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.268
(gasping)

06:41.268 --> 06:42.269
>> ELLA: Are they driving up?

06:42.269 --> 06:43.270
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.271
They should.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.272
>> KIP: Those two together.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.273
>> COURTNEY: At night, at night.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.274
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.108
>> COURTNEY: I mean, that's

06:48.108 --> 06:49.109
insane.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.110
>> KIP: For five hours.

06:50.110 --> 06:50.944
>> CANDIS: Kate and Jenny

06:50.944 --> 06:51.779
together for five hours.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.613
>> KIP: In the car by

06:52.613 --> 06:53.614
themselves.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.615
(laughter)

06:54.615 --> 06:55.483
>> COURTNEY: This salmon is so

06:55.483 --> 06:56.484
good. Wow.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.551
>> ELLA: I want to talk to you

06:57.551 --> 06:58.552
about this.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.787
I-I do a lot of, like, writing

06:59.787 --> 07:01.188
music, um, on my free time and

07:01.188 --> 07:02.189
stuff...

07:02.189 --> 07:03.023
>> CANDIS: Well, what about

07:03.023 --> 07:04.024
singing? Can you sing?

07:04.024 --> 07:04.858
>> ELLA: I don't have the

07:04.858 --> 07:05.693
highest voice in the world.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.527
>> COURTNEY: Can you sing us a

07:06.527 --> 07:07.528
little tune?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.529
>> ELLA: I'm not...

07:08.529 --> 07:09.362
No, I'm very insecure.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.197
>> COURTNEY: Just a little

07:10.197 --> 07:11.198
something.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.032
>> KIP: How about we do a barter

07:12.032 --> 07:13.033
system?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.034
>> ELLA: Okay.

07:14.034 --> 07:14.868
>> KIP: What would Cait and

07:14.868 --> 07:15.703
Candis have to do in order to

07:15.703 --> 07:17.705
make you sing?

07:17.705 --> 07:18.706
>> ELLA: Oh, that's easy.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.707
>> COURTNEY: What?

07:19.707 --> 07:20.708
>> ELLA: Kiss.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.709
(Candis chuckles)

07:21.709 --> 07:22.710
>> KIP: I know.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.544
So, if you guys kiss...

07:23.544 --> 07:24.377
>> COURTNEY: If you two kiss on

07:24.377 --> 07:25.212
the lips, she'll sing.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.548
>> KIP: ...she'll sing.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.549
>> WOMAN: Which one's Candis?

07:28.549 --> 07:29.550
>> ALL: Oh!

07:29.550 --> 07:30.784
>> CHANDI: Candis and Caitlyn in

07:30.784 --> 07:33.587
the tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.055
>> ZACKARY: Yes, I love it!

07:35.055 --> 07:36.056
(Caitlyn laughs)

07:36.056 --> 07:37.057
>> CANDIS: Tada!

07:37.057 --> 07:38.058
>> KIP: No one has ever

07:38.058 --> 07:39.059
challenged Caitlyn Jenner to

07:39.059 --> 07:40.060
anything that she hasn't stepped

07:40.060 --> 07:41.061
up to the plate.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.195
>> COURTNEY: You might as well

07:42.195 --> 07:43.196
use your lips.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.265
Both of you have gorgeous lips.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.266
Just, like, smack 'em together.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.167
>> ELLA: It's like a friendship

07:47.167 --> 07:48.536
cuddle, a lip snuggle.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.537
(Candis laughs)

07:49.537 --> 07:50.538
>> COURTNEY: I mean, just go

07:50.538 --> 07:51.539
in...

07:51.539 --> 07:52.540
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.541
Court!

07:53.541 --> 07:54.341
>> ELLA: Think of it as like a

07:54.341 --> 07:55.175
dare, fun friendly dare.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.176
>> COURTNEY: Yeah!

07:56.176 --> 07:57.010
>> ELLA: I will kiss anyone.

07:57.010 --> 07:57.845
>> COURTNEY: We double dog dare

07:57.845 --> 07:58.846
you.

07:58.846 --> 07:59.847
(Candis laughs)

07:59.847 --> 08:00.914
>> CAITLYN: What?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.382
>> COURTNEY: Ooh.

08:02.382 --> 08:06.019
Oh. Oh.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.122
(Candis laughs)

08:09.122 --> 08:11.124
(laughter)

08:11.124 --> 08:12.192
>> ELLA: There was tongue, and

08:12.192 --> 08:13.026
it was like, one Mississippi,

08:13.026 --> 08:14.027
two.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.028
>> KIP: And I had...

08:15.028 --> 08:15.863
I was on the edge of my seat.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.864
>> JENNY: Well, well, well.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.966
>> ELLA: I was so...

08:18.966 --> 08:20.300
>> NEWSMAN: The HERO Measure in

08:20.300 --> 08:22.135
Houston has been repealed.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.571
Five conservative Christian

08:23.571 --> 08:24.572
pastors in Houston have been

08:24.572 --> 08:25.573
leading the charge...

08:25.573 --> 08:26.574
>> JENNY: Republicans.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.841
Your people.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.410
They don't like us.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.411
>> KATE: It sounds like to me

08:31.411 --> 08:33.113
that we are entering bathrooms

08:33.113 --> 08:34.381
with the intention of creating

08:34.381 --> 08:35.382
a disturbance.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.150
Seriously, that could mean

08:37.150 --> 08:39.119
arrest.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.589
>> KIP: No one has ever

08:41.589 --> 08:42.590
challenged Caitlyn Jenner to

08:42.590 --> 08:43.591
anything that she hasn't stepped

08:43.591 --> 08:44.592
up to the plate.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.059
>> CAITLYN: What?

08:46.059 --> 08:49.029
>> COURTNEY: Ooh. Oh. Oh.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.432
(Candis laughs)

08:54.602 --> 08:56.436
(gasping, laughter)

08:56.436 --> 08:58.371
>> KIP: Yes!

08:58.371 --> 09:00.040
Yes!

09:00.040 --> 09:02.075
(clapping, pounding)

09:05.178 --> 09:07.147
>> COURTNEY: Oh, my God!

09:07.147 --> 09:09.149
>> ELLA: (bleep) I have to sing!

09:09.149 --> 09:10.150
>> CANDIS: Look it, they're all,

09:10.150 --> 09:10.818
like, huddling.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.885
(laughter)

09:11.885 --> 09:12.886
>> COURTNEY: That was not the

09:12.886 --> 09:14.688
kind of kiss I was expecting!

09:14.688 --> 09:15.689
>> KIP: Once more!

09:15.689 --> 09:17.490
>> COURTNEY: Oh, my God!

09:17.490 --> 09:18.491
>> CAITLYN: I can't believe

09:18.491 --> 09:19.760
everybody talked me into giving

09:19.760 --> 09:20.961
her a kiss.

09:20.961 --> 09:21.962
But it's good, because that's

09:21.962 --> 09:23.196
the most action I've got in the

09:23.196 --> 09:24.632
last two and a half years.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.299
(chuckles)

09:26.299 --> 09:27.534
>> COURTNEY: It's confirming

09:27.534 --> 09:28.636
everything.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.103
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, it is.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.772
That was crazy. (chuckles)

09:31.772 --> 09:33.741
I mean, it was all a joke.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.308
Truth or Dare, you know.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.309
That kind of thing.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.310
We're just friends.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.311
>> CAITLYN: But it was good.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.112
>> CANDIS: Yeah, you-you're a

09:39.112 --> 09:39.780
good kisser.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.781
>> CAITLYN: What room ya in?

09:40.781 --> 09:43.784
(laughter)

09:43.784 --> 09:45.753
(wind whistling)

09:47.888 --> 09:49.089
>> ELLA: There they are!

09:49.089 --> 09:50.924
>> KATE: Welcome!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.259
Wind chill all of a sudden.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.260
>> JENNY: Hi, sweetie.

09:53.260 --> 09:53.994
>> ELLA: My love!

09:53.994 --> 09:54.662
>> JENNY: How are ya?

09:54.662 --> 09:55.395
>> ELLA: We have a lot to talk

09:55.395 --> 09:56.063
about.

09:56.063 --> 09:56.730
>> KIP: You missed an

09:56.730 --> 09:57.665
entertaining dinner.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.199
I said, "What would Candis and

09:59.199 --> 10:00.267
Cait have to do to make you

10:00.267 --> 10:01.268
sing?"

10:01.268 --> 10:02.602
And Ella said, "Kiss."

10:02.602 --> 10:04.104
She just went in for it.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.105
>> JENNY: So... Really?

10:05.105 --> 10:05.839
>> KIP: There was a little

10:05.839 --> 10:06.640
tongue wrestling.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.708
>> JENNY: Well, well, well...

10:07.708 --> 10:08.709
>> ELLA: No, no, no. It not

10:08.709 --> 10:09.977
just...

10:09.977 --> 10:11.712
There was tongue, and it was,

10:11.712 --> 10:12.713
like...

10:12.713 --> 10:13.714
>> JENNY: Many-many good

10:13.714 --> 10:14.715
relationships have begun with a

10:14.715 --> 10:15.716
dare.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.850
(laughter)

10:16.850 --> 10:17.885
I think mine did.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.519
(laughter)

10:19.519 --> 10:20.988
>> ELLA: Hi!

10:20.988 --> 10:21.989
>> CANDIS: You guys made it, and

10:21.989 --> 10:22.990
that's what's important.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.024
>> JENNY: I understand you made

10:24.024 --> 10:24.692
it, too.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.358
(Candis scoffs)

10:25.358 --> 10:26.359
>> COURTNEY: The news traveled

10:26.359 --> 10:27.027
already?

10:27.027 --> 10:27.761
>> JENNY: Well, it got down to

10:27.761 --> 10:28.762
the... down to the gondola.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.897
So, did you have a friendly,

10:29.897 --> 10:30.931
platonic kiss?

10:30.931 --> 10:31.598
>> CAITLYN: I thought it was

10:31.598 --> 10:32.265
pretty damn good.

10:32.265 --> 10:32.933
>> CANDIS (laughing): Yeah.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.667
>> COURTNEY: Was there... was

10:33.667 --> 10:34.334
there tongue involved?

10:34.334 --> 10:35.135
>> CAITLYN: I don't know about

10:35.135 --> 10:36.136
you, but I thought it was... I

10:36.136 --> 10:36.870
thought it was really good.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.138
>> JENNY: Yay!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.406
>> CAITLYN: No, it was fun.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.508
>> CANDIS: Oh, it was fun.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.509
>> CAITLYN: I think it's

10:42.509 --> 10:43.510
clearing up.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.778
(laughter)

10:44.778 --> 10:46.179
>> KIP: Is that the sun?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.347
>> CANDIS: It says here, in

10:47.347 --> 10:50.483
PinkNews, "Presidential hopeful

10:50.483 --> 10:52.652
Ted Cruz worried transgendered

10:52.652 --> 10:54.755
kids might molest his daughters

10:54.755 --> 10:56.489
in the shower."

10:56.489 --> 10:58.258
>> KATE: Holy (bleep).

10:58.258 --> 10:59.259
>> CANDIS: "The Republican

10:59.259 --> 11:01.461
senator opposes basic equality

11:01.461 --> 11:02.429
for transgender people."

11:02.429 --> 11:03.731
>> ELLA: Oh.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
>> JENNY: There is a movement

11:05.733 --> 11:08.736
among some conservatives against

11:08.736 --> 11:11.171
LGBT people, and of late, trans

11:11.171 --> 11:12.472
people in particular.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.473
I'm thinking of the Houston

11:13.473 --> 11:15.108
thing, for instance.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.744
In Houston, an act called "The

11:16.744 --> 11:19.146
HERO Act," which guaranteed

11:19.146 --> 11:20.948
equality not just for LGBT

11:20.948 --> 11:23.316
people, but for all people, was

11:23.316 --> 11:24.985
in fact, repealed.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.754
There was a campaign for the

11:26.754 --> 11:28.588
repeal of "The HERO Act" that

11:28.588 --> 11:30.858
was run by a group of ministers

11:30.858 --> 11:33.426
and it was run, um, largely by

11:33.426 --> 11:34.828
conservative Republicans.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.396
The tactic that was used against

11:36.396 --> 11:38.331
our community was the threat

11:38.331 --> 11:40.300
that there would be sick men

11:40.300 --> 11:42.069
preying upon our children in

11:42.069 --> 11:43.937
restrooms.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.472
>> WOMAN: Any man at anytime

11:45.472 --> 11:47.007
could enter a woman's bathroom

11:47.007 --> 11:48.241
simply by claiming to be a woman

11:48.241 --> 11:49.276
that day.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.811
No one is exempt.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.881
Even registered sex offenders.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.816
Protect women's privacy, prevent

11:55.816 --> 11:57.484
danger, vote no on the

11:57.484 --> 11:58.651
Proposition 1 bathroom

11:58.651 --> 11:59.552
ordinance.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.388
It goes too far.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.257
(door slams)

12:04.257 --> 12:05.793
>> JENNY: It was shocking.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.227
It was a lie, and it happened to

12:07.227 --> 12:08.328
work.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.797
Is it your sense that you could

12:09.797 --> 12:11.231
talk to any of the Republican

12:11.231 --> 12:12.632
candidates and... about this

12:12.632 --> 12:14.634
issue and win them over?

12:14.634 --> 12:15.635
>> CAITLYN: Well, I don't really

12:15.635 --> 12:17.070
want to get involved politically

12:17.070 --> 12:19.072
on-on that level.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.240
Like, I'm gonna go out and do

12:20.240 --> 12:21.574
political stuff, no.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.010
>> KATE: You're in a position to

12:23.010 --> 12:25.178
actually change things.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.147
You're in a position to say,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.917
"Yo, I am a conservative and I'm

12:29.917 --> 12:31.651
a Republican, I believe in small

12:31.651 --> 12:33.453
government, and..."

12:33.453 --> 12:34.421
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.255
>> KATE: "...lay off the

12:35.255 --> 12:37.958
queers."

12:37.958 --> 12:39.392
>> JENNY: She's a leader now,

12:39.392 --> 12:40.660
whether she likes it or not.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.595
And she needs to stand in

12:42.595 --> 12:43.563
solidarity with the trans

12:43.563 --> 12:45.833
community on LGBT equality.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.168
She needs to understand how it--

12:48.168 --> 12:50.137
how urgent this-this work is.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.341
>> CANDIS: Are you gonna talk to

12:54.341 --> 12:55.342
your dad?

12:55.342 --> 12:57.377
It will only strengthen your

12:57.377 --> 12:59.612
relationship.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.914
>> CHANDI: Houston, we really do

13:00.914 --> 13:02.082
have a problem.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.250
Going to the bathroom is

13:03.250 --> 13:05.052
something that everyone does.

13:05.052 --> 13:05.853
>> CAITLYN: A little

13:05.853 --> 13:06.653
disobedience... I say we go

13:06.653 --> 13:07.420
visit some bathrooms.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.389
What do you say?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.427
>> ELLA: Hello?

13:14.427 --> 13:15.528
>> CANDIS: Hello?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.397
>> ELLA: Slumber party!

13:17.397 --> 13:18.231
>> JENNY: Hi, darling.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.632
>> ELLA: Hi.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.201
>> CAITLYN: Wine, anybody?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.202
>> JENNY: Oh, maybe just a

13:22.202 --> 13:23.370
glass.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.606
>> ELLA: So, um, Caitlyn...

13:26.606 --> 13:27.607
(cork pops)

13:27.607 --> 13:28.441
>> ELLA: ...I was looking on

13:28.441 --> 13:31.111
Facebook, and I, knowing you, I

13:31.111 --> 13:32.179
understand where you're coming

13:32.179 --> 13:32.880
from...

13:32.880 --> 13:34.081
>> CAITLYN: What did I say now?!

13:34.081 --> 13:36.183
>> ELLA: You made a comment, um,

13:36.183 --> 13:36.884
I think it was...

13:36.884 --> 13:37.784
>> CAITLYN: What was my comment?

13:37.784 --> 13:38.518
>> ELLA: Presi...

13:38.518 --> 13:39.352
>> JENNY: It's a thing we've

13:39.352 --> 13:40.287
actually heard you say before,

13:40.287 --> 13:41.521
and it's within the much larger

13:41.521 --> 13:42.589
context of the Time magazine

13:42.589 --> 13:43.523
article.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.424
>> CANDIS: That if you look like

13:44.424 --> 13:46.059
a man in a dress, it makes other

13:46.059 --> 13:47.360
people uncomfortable.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.561
>> CAITLYN: Is that bad?

13:48.561 --> 13:49.897
Does the trans community look at

13:49.897 --> 13:51.798
that and go, "Oh, my God"?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.033
>> JENNY: Here's the thing.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.302
There is a movement among some

13:55.302 --> 13:56.803
conservatives to demonize

13:56.803 --> 13:58.405
transgender people.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.672
The tactic used against our

13:59.672 --> 14:02.309
community was the threat that

14:02.309 --> 14:05.012
there would be sick men in

14:05.012 --> 14:06.479
dresses preying upon our

14:06.479 --> 14:07.915
children.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.049
>> CANDIS: And so, when you

14:09.049 --> 14:11.484
refer to us as "men in dresses,"

14:11.484 --> 14:14.021
you're validating all of these

14:14.021 --> 14:16.256
pastors and politicians that are

14:16.256 --> 14:19.026
using scare tactics against us.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.560
We've been fighting that image

14:20.560 --> 14:22.262
for decades.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.932
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.533
Oh, my God.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.667
>> CANDIS: Cait is a

14:27.667 --> 14:30.037
representative of our community,

14:30.037 --> 14:32.072
and so she does have to think

14:32.072 --> 14:33.740
before she speaks, because

14:33.740 --> 14:35.308
the world grabs onto

14:35.308 --> 14:36.809
everything she says.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.946
And with the phrase "men in

14:38.946 --> 14:40.580
dresses," Cait really screwed

14:40.580 --> 14:41.814
up.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.051
We have to change the way people

14:44.051 --> 14:46.253
look at people who are

14:46.253 --> 14:48.321
transitioning or transitioned.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.758
We have to show that it's okay

14:51.758 --> 14:54.962
to be, you know, non-conforming.

14:54.962 --> 14:55.963
>> JENNY: People need to know

14:55.963 --> 14:57.064
you're fighting for everybody,

14:57.064 --> 14:59.432
not just the pretty ones.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.600
>> CAITLYN: You're absolutely

15:00.600 --> 15:01.668
right.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.802
And I agree with that.

15:02.802 --> 15:03.971
I totally agree with everything

15:03.971 --> 15:04.604
you're saying.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.138
>> JENNY: Exactly.

15:05.138 --> 15:05.805
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

15:05.805 --> 15:06.974
>> CAITLYN: So, how then, do I

15:06.974 --> 15:07.975
word it?

15:07.975 --> 15:09.242
Let me think.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.677
What about, uh, we have a lot of

15:10.677 --> 15:11.678
people that are gender

15:11.678 --> 15:12.879
non-conforming, that are just

15:12.879 --> 15:14.047
very comfortable with

15:14.047 --> 15:15.983
themselves, uh, in the way that

15:15.983 --> 15:19.019
they look, and it may not be the

15:19.019 --> 15:22.990
norm, uh, within society, but

15:22.990 --> 15:24.557
they're comfortable with the way

15:24.557 --> 15:25.458
they look.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.259
>> JENNY: "And I'm fighting for

15:26.259 --> 15:26.994
them, too."

15:26.994 --> 15:27.727
>> CAITLYN: And I'm fighting for

15:27.727 --> 15:28.395
them, too.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.196
(excited stammering)

15:29.196 --> 15:30.197
>> CANDIS: So you did it!

15:30.197 --> 15:31.431
>> JENNY: Yeah!

15:31.431 --> 15:32.632
That's how you do it!

15:32.632 --> 15:33.833
>> CANDIS: That's how you do it!

15:33.833 --> 15:35.335
>> CAITLYN: Okay! Wow.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.269
>> CANDIS: Cheers to that.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.004
>> CAITLYN: I want to... yeah,

15:37.004 --> 15:37.904
here's to that, okay.

15:37.904 --> 15:38.738
>> JENNY: I thought we were just

15:38.738 --> 15:39.806
gonna hang out.

15:39.806 --> 15:40.840
>> CAITLYN: The last thing I

15:40.840 --> 15:42.142
want to do is create more, you

15:42.142 --> 15:43.143
know, stereotypes of our

15:43.143 --> 15:44.211
community.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.612
The girls have taught me that

15:45.612 --> 15:47.414
that term, "a man in a dress,"

15:47.414 --> 15:49.016
is the way the kind of

15:49.016 --> 15:51.684
"anti-trans" people out there

15:51.684 --> 15:53.686
refer to us.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.854
I never really thought of it

15:54.854 --> 15:56.023
that way, but the girls kind of

15:56.023 --> 15:57.357
opened my mind up to that.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.359
So, um, yeah, I don't think I'll

15:59.359 --> 16:00.660
use that phrase again.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.894
>> JENNY: One of the things that

16:01.894 --> 16:03.396
we can do is...

16:03.396 --> 16:04.297
>> CAITLYN: What can we do?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.332
>> JENNY: ...we can send out the

16:05.332 --> 16:07.067
message that no matter how you

16:07.067 --> 16:09.102
look, it's okay.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.271
You have every much as right to

16:11.271 --> 16:12.705
your life and authenticity as

16:12.705 --> 16:13.373
anybody.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.407
And the way you send out that

16:14.407 --> 16:15.408
message?

16:15.408 --> 16:16.543
Well, if only you had a TV show

16:16.543 --> 16:17.444
or something...

16:17.444 --> 16:18.245
(Candis chuckles)

16:18.245 --> 16:19.179
>> JENNY: ...where-where

16:19.179 --> 16:20.047
you could...

16:20.047 --> 16:21.181
>> CAITLYN: Maybe we should look

16:21.181 --> 16:21.848
into that.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.184
(Candis laughs)

16:31.491 --> 16:33.460
(Caitlyn whoops)

16:36.263 --> 16:37.764
>> CAITLYN: All right.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.732
(exclaims, laughs)

16:45.238 --> 16:46.239
>> CANDIS: How did it go for

16:46.239 --> 16:46.939
you?

16:46.939 --> 16:47.840
>> CAITLYN: Good!

16:47.840 --> 16:49.409
Knee's sore. I'm kind of done.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.810
>> CANDIS: How did you do, El?

16:50.810 --> 16:51.878
>> ELLA: It was pretty steep in

16:51.878 --> 16:53.646
some parts, the very beginning,

16:53.646 --> 16:55.515
but, um, we ended up getting to

16:55.515 --> 16:57.084
a side of the mountain where it

16:57.084 --> 16:59.119
was, like... perfect.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.288
>> CANDIS: So, are you gonna...

17:01.288 --> 17:02.889
are you gonna talk to your dad

17:02.889 --> 17:05.892
when you get home?

17:05.892 --> 17:07.194
>> ELLA: I don't know, I mean...

17:07.194 --> 17:08.161
>> CANDIS: About how you're

17:08.161 --> 17:09.829
feeling.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.264
>> ELLA: It's to the point where

17:11.264 --> 17:14.334
it's like... our relationship

17:14.334 --> 17:16.336
now is, like, intermediately

17:16.336 --> 17:17.337
decent.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.573
Do I interfere with that?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.008
Even though, like, obviously,

17:22.008 --> 17:24.010
I-I will admit I do have, like,

17:24.010 --> 17:25.845
a little issues with it.

17:25.845 --> 17:26.746
>> CANDIS: Right.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.580
>> ELLA: When it's brought up,

17:27.580 --> 17:28.515
you know?

17:28.515 --> 17:29.349
>> CANDIS: I mean, you could

17:29.349 --> 17:30.350
talk to him about it in a

17:30.350 --> 17:31.851
positive way, say, "Oh, this is

17:31.851 --> 17:33.453
how I used to feel."

17:33.453 --> 17:35.155
I think that it will only

17:35.155 --> 17:37.257
strengthen your relationship if

17:37.257 --> 17:38.958
you, like, just tell him how you

17:38.958 --> 17:39.959
felt.

17:39.959 --> 17:40.960
>> ELLA: Yeah.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.695
>> CANDIS: But it could be...

17:42.695 --> 17:44.131
>> ELLA: Do I want to strengthen

17:44.131 --> 17:45.165
it, though?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.233
That's the thing.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.700
The wounds that are there have

17:47.700 --> 17:49.736
led me to not really want to

17:49.736 --> 17:53.240
pursue, you know...

17:53.240 --> 17:55.007
something better.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.209
Kind of just like, "I'm okay

17:56.209 --> 17:58.411
with it, let's just keep it like

17:58.411 --> 18:00.147
this."

18:00.147 --> 18:01.581
>> CANDIS: Maybe it's a good

18:01.581 --> 18:04.417
thing to just tell him how you

18:04.417 --> 18:06.953
used to feel; as much for you, I

18:06.953 --> 18:07.954
think, you'll get out of it, he

18:07.954 --> 18:09.256
will also.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.224
>> ELLA: Yeah.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.596
>> CAITLYN: We're stuck, baby.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.164
Morning.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.165
>> KATE: Good morning, lovely.

18:18.165 --> 18:18.798
>> CAITLYN: Good morning.

18:18.798 --> 18:19.599
Morning.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.400
>> CANDIS: Ella...

18:20.400 --> 18:21.401
>> JENNY: Breakfast!

18:21.401 --> 18:22.402
>> CAITLYN: Do we have a plan

18:22.402 --> 18:23.403
for the day?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.404
>> JENNY: Yes.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.505
Excuse me, Kate.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.806
>> KATE: Shopping!

18:26.806 --> 18:27.807
>> JENNY: I'm gonna go shopping

18:27.807 --> 18:28.808
with-with Kate B. today.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.809
>> CAITLYN: You two have bonded.

18:29.809 --> 18:30.810
>> KATE: We have.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.811
>> JENNY: Well, well, yeah.

18:31.811 --> 18:32.812
>> KATE: We have. At the hip.

18:32.812 --> 18:33.813
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, when we

18:33.813 --> 18:34.814
started this, you didn't know if

18:34.814 --> 18:35.815
you even wanted to come because

18:35.815 --> 18:36.816
of um, Miss Boylan.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.817
>> JENNY: Mm, yeah.

18:37.817 --> 18:38.818
>> KATE: Doing it.

18:38.818 --> 18:39.819
>> CAITLYN: That's what makes

18:39.819 --> 18:40.820
our country great.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.821
That we can have differences of

18:41.821 --> 18:42.822
opinion...

18:42.822 --> 18:43.823
>> JENNY: Diversity.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.824
>> CAITLYN: ...and hopefully

18:44.824 --> 18:46.893
take the best opinions, put 'em

18:46.893 --> 18:47.894
together and come up with

18:47.894 --> 18:49.296
something that's constructive

18:49.296 --> 18:51.398
for as many people as we

18:51.398 --> 18:52.399
possibly can.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.400
>> JENNY: I was thinking about

18:53.400 --> 18:55.635
Houston and The Hero Act.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.370
I went online before I went to

18:57.370 --> 18:58.738
sleep and found a number of

18:58.738 --> 18:59.739
links.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.509
My concern is that there really

19:02.509 --> 19:05.312
appears to me to be a shocking

19:05.312 --> 19:10.483
amount of, um, hatred of LGB and

19:10.483 --> 19:12.685
especially T people, that drove

19:12.685 --> 19:14.987
the Houston repeal.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
It was largely driven by

19:16.989 --> 19:19.226
conservatives, it was driven by

19:19.226 --> 19:20.460
people who stood on...

19:20.460 --> 19:21.461
>> CAITLYN: No, it was driven by

19:21.461 --> 19:22.862
people, we don't know what their

19:22.862 --> 19:24.697
political stuff was or if it was

19:24.697 --> 19:27.066
even true, but it was delivered,

19:27.066 --> 19:28.868
it was, yeah.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.437
>> JENNY: Cait has a disconnect.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.606
She does not accept that there

19:33.606 --> 19:36.343
is any element in either the

19:36.343 --> 19:37.410
Republican Party or the

19:37.410 --> 19:39.312
conservative movement that has

19:39.312 --> 19:42.582
ever been against LGBT people.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.417
And that stops today.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.585
>> MAN (over computer): The Hero

19:45.585 --> 19:46.753
Measure in Houston has been

19:46.753 --> 19:48.120
repealed.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.256
Five conservative Christian

19:49.256 --> 19:51.057
pastors in Houston, known as The

19:51.057 --> 19:52.692
Houston Five, have been leading

19:52.692 --> 19:54.361
the charge to repeal the Houston

19:54.361 --> 19:56.263
Equal Rights ordinance meant to

19:56.263 --> 19:57.530
prohibit discrimination of

19:57.530 --> 19:59.165
public accommodations.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.267
Republican presidential

20:00.267 --> 20:01.868
candidate Ted Cruz was quoted as

20:01.868 --> 20:03.470
saying that, "We should all be

20:03.470 --> 20:04.637
proud to stand up and defend the

20:04.637 --> 20:05.838
pastors."

20:05.838 --> 20:07.039
>> CAITLYN: Well.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.040
I think he's just totally

20:08.040 --> 20:09.776
misinformed, yeah.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.544
>> JENNY: Ted Cruz said that.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.112
Republicans-- your people--

20:13.112 --> 20:15.147
they don't like us.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.349
>> CAITLYN: They're not my

20:16.349 --> 20:17.350
people if they're against this

20:17.350 --> 20:18.451
issue.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.986
So, big deal. I'm-I'm not, like,

20:19.986 --> 20:21.288
oh, cheering them on.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.289
>> KATE: You are; you're voting

20:22.289 --> 20:23.723
for Ted Cruz!

20:23.723 --> 20:25.692
You're cheering him on!

20:25.692 --> 20:26.926
>> CAITLYN: Um, because I think

20:26.926 --> 20:27.960
he can take care of the big

20:27.960 --> 20:28.995
issues.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.129
>> KATE: It's not either/or.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.398
You can't say you're not

20:31.398 --> 20:32.799
cheering people on and then say

20:32.799 --> 20:34.567
Ted Cruz, who uses "trans" as a

20:34.567 --> 20:37.203
slur any chance he gets...

20:39.238 --> 20:41.107
Nah.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.609
>> ELLA: Just looking at my dad,

20:42.609 --> 20:44.411
and just knowing that I was

20:44.411 --> 20:46.212
gonna confront him about

20:46.212 --> 20:48.648
everything, I could just feel my

20:48.648 --> 20:50.750
heart jumping out of my chest.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.320
>> PETER: What's up?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.354
>> CAITLYN: There it is-- that's

20:54.354 --> 20:55.355
the church.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.356
>> JENNY: We may be provoking

20:56.356 --> 20:57.357
trouble.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.358
>> CAITLYN: Here we go.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.359
>> KATE: Caitlyn said to the

20:59.359 --> 21:00.860
reverend, "Your comments are

21:00.860 --> 21:02.762
highly offensive to all

21:02.762 --> 21:04.397
trans people."

21:04.397 --> 21:05.865
And no one has said that to his

21:05.865 --> 21:07.834
face before that.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.672
>> KATE: Ted Cruz said that one

21:12.672 --> 21:13.906
of the first things he's gonna

21:13.906 --> 21:15.442
do when he gets in office is

21:15.442 --> 21:18.345
strike down Obama's memo saying,

21:18.345 --> 21:19.679
"You got to treat trans people

21:19.679 --> 21:21.381
like human beings."

21:21.381 --> 21:23.249
There's Republican ideology.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.351
>> CAITLYN: Right.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.518
>> KATE: It has nothing to do

21:25.518 --> 21:27.487
with homophobia and transphobia,

21:27.487 --> 21:29.522
and yet, they are stirring it up

21:29.522 --> 21:32.158
and using it to get votes.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.393
>> CAITLYN: I know.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.727
I agree with that.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.128
I'm looking for the same thing.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.097
The entire bathroom issue,

21:38.097 --> 21:39.131
this is something that all us

21:39.131 --> 21:40.500
girls have to be, you know,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.068
unified on.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.636
To understand this issue better,

21:43.636 --> 21:44.971
maybe the best thing to do is go

21:44.971 --> 21:46.105
to Houston.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.874
I would love to sit down with

21:47.874 --> 21:48.875
these pastors who have made

21:48.875 --> 21:49.876
a big thing.

21:49.876 --> 21:50.943
>> JENNY: Oh, so...

21:50.943 --> 21:51.944
>> CAITLYN: Say, "What's your

21:51.944 --> 21:53.079
issue here?"

21:53.079 --> 21:55.047
One of the things I realized is

21:55.047 --> 21:57.149
the more conservative side has

21:57.149 --> 21:59.386
been, uh, less open to our

21:59.386 --> 22:00.553
community.

22:00.553 --> 22:01.854
I want the girls to know that,

22:01.854 --> 22:02.855
certainly, when it comes to

22:02.855 --> 22:04.190
trans issues, I'm gonna be on

22:04.190 --> 22:05.625
the same fight as them.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.759
So, I think it's time to go to

22:06.759 --> 22:07.860
Houston.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.228
>> CANDIS: Don't walk into a

22:09.228 --> 22:11.063
bathroom. (chuckles)

22:11.063 --> 22:12.064
>> CAITLYN: Uh, well, we can

22:12.064 --> 22:13.065
walk into a bathroom.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.066
Yeah, I'm certainly not going

22:14.066 --> 22:15.067
in the men's room.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.169
>> CANDIS: I know that Cait is

22:17.169 --> 22:18.571
a Republican.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.039
She's not gonna switch parties.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.441
So, you know, hearing her

22:21.441 --> 22:23.410
acknowledge that it is mostly

22:23.410 --> 22:25.412
the Republican Party which is

22:25.412 --> 22:27.414
giving roadblock after roadblock

22:27.414 --> 22:29.549
to every important issue

22:29.549 --> 22:31.418
that matters to us.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.753
That was a huge step.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.522
>> KATE: I want to congratulate

22:35.522 --> 22:37.256
all of us here, how far we've

22:37.256 --> 22:38.491
come from that explosive day on

22:38.491 --> 22:39.526
the bus.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.527
>> CANDIS: Oh, God.

22:40.527 --> 22:41.528
>> KATE: We're now able to

22:41.528 --> 22:42.529
talk about this (bleep).

22:42.529 --> 22:43.530
>> JENNY: Everyone put

22:43.530 --> 22:44.263
your hand in.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.164
>> CAITLYN: And all of us

22:45.164 --> 22:45.932
together-- come on, Kate,

22:45.932 --> 22:46.833
put it in there.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.534
(laughter)

22:47.534 --> 22:48.535
There, put it in there!

22:48.535 --> 22:50.002
>> ALL: One, two, three!

22:50.002 --> 22:51.971
(all cheer)

22:57.977 --> 22:59.946
(Ella sighs)

23:04.451 --> 23:05.518
>> ELLA: Do you want something

23:05.518 --> 23:06.586
to eat?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.788
>> PETER: Yes, I'm hungry.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.457
>> ELLA: Okay.

23:10.457 --> 23:13.626
I am so nervous.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.696
Just looking at my dad, and just

23:16.696 --> 23:18.598
knowing that I am gonna confront

23:18.598 --> 23:22.469
him about everything...

23:22.469 --> 23:24.671
I can just feel my heart jumping

23:24.671 --> 23:27.306
out of my chest.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.543
>> PETER: What's up?

23:30.543 --> 23:34.313
>> ELLA: Um, I actually, um...

23:34.313 --> 23:36.382
did want to talk to you about

23:36.382 --> 23:37.984
some stuff.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.952
Um...

23:41.988 --> 23:43.890
Don't take it the, like, I-I

23:43.890 --> 23:44.924
don't want to, like, I-I'm not

23:44.924 --> 23:47.059
trying to attack you.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.895
During lunch with Cait and

23:48.895 --> 23:52.832
Candis, um, it was hard

23:52.832 --> 23:54.601
listening to you as the

23:54.601 --> 23:56.803
accepting father.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.671
I didn't even realize that there

23:58.671 --> 24:00.973
was still kind of, like, some

24:00.973 --> 24:04.010
inner frustration and anger.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.311
I don't want to say I'm angry

24:05.311 --> 24:06.312
with you, but in a way, I kind

24:06.312 --> 24:07.313
of...

24:07.313 --> 24:08.314
>> PETER: I know it was

24:08.314 --> 24:09.315
difficult in the beginning.

24:09.315 --> 24:10.182
I understand.

24:10.182 --> 24:10.983
It was, it was very hard for

24:10.983 --> 24:11.984
me to accept it.

24:11.984 --> 24:12.685
>> ELLA: Yeah, but...

24:12.685 --> 24:13.686
>> PETER: Understand it.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.555
>> ELLA: It was terrible.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.023
>> PETER: It was hard.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.592
I mean, I was a wreck.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.627
>> ELLA: Do you know I was

24:20.627 --> 24:21.661
almost-- you know I was almost

24:21.661 --> 24:23.429
getting emancipated?

24:23.429 --> 24:24.430
>> PETER: What?

24:24.430 --> 24:25.932
Explain that.

24:25.932 --> 24:26.966
>> ELLA: It's the truth.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.034
>> PETER: Explain that.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.268
That you were gonna take away my

24:29.268 --> 24:30.402
fatherhood from you-- is that

24:30.402 --> 24:31.538
what that means?

24:31.538 --> 24:32.539
Tell me.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.540
>> ELLA: I was.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.774
>> PETER: You did, really?

24:34.774 --> 24:37.910
>> ELLA: I almost did.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.580
>> PETER: Are you kidding?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.581
>> ELLA: I didn't tell you, but

24:41.581 --> 24:42.582
that's how hard it was at the...

24:42.582 --> 24:43.583
>> PETER: Is this-- Now...

24:43.583 --> 24:44.584
>> ELLA: And I think it's

24:44.584 --> 24:45.585
funny that we can laugh about

24:45.585 --> 24:46.586
this, in a sense, because it's,

24:46.586 --> 24:47.620
like, where you are now, from

24:47.620 --> 24:48.621
where you were, but that's just

24:48.621 --> 24:49.622
the degree.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.623
>> PETER: You know, I-I got to

24:50.623 --> 24:51.624
be, I-I got to be straight up.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.894
It would be your loss.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.796
I tell you, I'm gonna be, tell

24:56.796 --> 24:57.797
you the truth, it would be your

24:57.797 --> 24:58.965
loss.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.901
'Cause if anything I did...

25:01.901 --> 25:03.202
>> ELLA: It almost was yours,

25:03.202 --> 25:04.904
too.

25:04.904 --> 25:05.938
>> PETER: But I would've fought

25:05.938 --> 25:06.939
for you.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.908
>> ELLA: You weren't fighting.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.116
>> KATE: It sounds like, to me,

25:17.116 --> 25:18.718
that we are entering bathrooms

25:18.718 --> 25:19.886
with the intention of creating a

25:19.886 --> 25:21.120
disturbance.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.155
So, you know, seriously, uh,

25:23.155 --> 25:25.592
that could mean arrest.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.093
>> JENNY: I'm petrified.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.928
I'm, uh, a transgender woman

25:28.928 --> 25:29.929
who's in town looking for a

25:29.929 --> 25:30.930
place to worship.

25:30.930 --> 25:31.931
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn Jenner

25:31.931 --> 25:32.932
here.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.401
(line clicks)

25:35.401 --> 25:36.969
(all gasping)

25:36.969 --> 25:38.938
(all murmuring in surprise)

25:40.472 --> 25:41.908
>> PETER: But I would've fought

25:41.908 --> 25:43.142
for you.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.111
>> ELLA: You weren't fighting.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.616
That's just the degree of hurt

25:49.616 --> 25:50.617
that I was feeling.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.618
>> PETER: I get it, I remember.

25:51.618 --> 25:52.619
I-I-- by the way,

25:52.619 --> 25:53.620
I don't like to think back.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.621
>> ELLA: I don't, either.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.287
>> PETER: I don't like to

25:55.287 --> 25:56.288
think back to the way that...

25:56.288 --> 25:56.956
>> ELLA: Hi.

25:56.956 --> 25:57.957
>> PETER: ...I-I had to deal

25:57.957 --> 25:59.225
with that.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.193
Thank you so much.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.762
>> ELLA: I think one of the

26:02.762 --> 26:04.496
problems also was that, if I

26:04.496 --> 26:05.932
mention it, it would just be

26:05.932 --> 26:07.634
more of-- You know how you said

26:07.634 --> 26:08.635
you don't like to talk about

26:08.635 --> 26:09.636
those days, you know.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.637
>> PETER: The past.

26:10.637 --> 26:11.370
>> ELLA: "I want to keep that

26:11.370 --> 26:12.071
there, it's the past."

26:12.071 --> 26:13.072
But I felt like you never

26:13.072 --> 26:14.073
acknowledged the pain.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.074
>> PETER: Well, I acknowledge it

26:15.074 --> 26:16.442
now.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.277
I'm sorry.

26:18.277 --> 26:22.048
I love you, you know?

26:22.048 --> 26:24.550
Through this transition, I see

26:24.550 --> 26:25.551
my daughter blossom like a

26:25.551 --> 26:26.552
flower.

26:26.552 --> 26:27.553
Guess what?

26:27.553 --> 26:28.554
Her father's blossoming like a

26:28.554 --> 26:32.024
flower... through you.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.966
>> ELLA: Oh, Dad!

26:39.966 --> 26:41.267
I love you!

26:41.267 --> 26:43.235
I do.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.143
(Ella laughs)

26:51.143 --> 26:52.278
>> PETER: You're an amazing

26:52.278 --> 26:53.412
human being.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.914
I'm-I'm proud of you, babe, with

26:54.914 --> 26:56.582
all my heart.

26:56.582 --> 26:58.217
I'll be better, always.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.919
(Ella sobs softly)

26:59.919 --> 27:00.920
>> ELLA: Okay.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.421
Thank you.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.691
I guess I've always

27:04.691 --> 27:07.326
subconsciously labeled my dad's

27:07.326 --> 27:09.328
love as conditional, but, um,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.230
today, it was like I saw him for

27:11.230 --> 27:12.965
the first time.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.200
(sniffles)

27:14.200 --> 27:18.838
Um, I think this is definitely a

27:18.838 --> 27:20.707
starting point for us to go from

27:20.707 --> 27:22.942
here and only get better.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.443
>> PETER: Life is a blessing,

27:24.443 --> 27:25.444
and we're gonna continue to

27:25.444 --> 27:26.913
grow, and we're gonna continue

27:26.913 --> 27:28.247
to love, and we're gonna be good

27:28.247 --> 27:29.248
humans, okay, babe?

27:29.248 --> 27:30.249
>> ELLA: Yeah.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.250
(laughs)

27:31.250 --> 27:32.384
I need some bacon now.

27:32.384 --> 27:36.222
(laughs)

27:36.222 --> 27:38.190
(birds chirping)

27:45.064 --> 27:47.299
>> CAITLYN: All right, guys, we

27:47.299 --> 27:48.300
made it!

27:48.300 --> 27:49.936
We are in Houston!

27:49.936 --> 27:50.937
(all cheering)

27:50.937 --> 27:51.938
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

27:51.938 --> 27:52.939
>> KATE: Yippee-ki-yi-yay!

27:52.939 --> 27:54.273
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

27:54.273 --> 27:55.274
(laughter)

27:55.274 --> 27:56.943
>> CHANDI: I grew up in a very

27:56.943 --> 28:00.479
religious background, and I love

28:00.479 --> 28:03.182
to be in situations where we can

28:03.182 --> 28:04.751
talk about our faiths.

28:04.751 --> 28:08.755
And the ways that the ministers

28:08.755 --> 28:10.522
here in Houston discouraged

28:10.522 --> 28:12.391
people to make them not vote

28:12.391 --> 28:14.794
for The HERO Act were totally

28:14.794 --> 28:16.763
not right.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.001
>> JENNY: Houston is a great

28:22.001 --> 28:24.303
town for LGBTQ activism, and

28:24.303 --> 28:25.537
there's people who have been

28:25.537 --> 28:27.039
doing this work here, some very

28:27.039 --> 28:28.574
good activists, fighting this

28:28.574 --> 28:30.342
fight for a long, long time.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.811
And I know there are probably

28:31.811 --> 28:33.145
a lot of people in Houston who

28:33.145 --> 28:34.613
have... who have met with these

28:34.613 --> 28:35.848
ministers, so we're not gonna be

28:35.848 --> 28:36.849
the first trans people that

28:36.849 --> 28:38.017
they've ever seen.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.219
But... it's still important.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.022
(bell clanging)

28:43.022 --> 28:45.524
(knocking)

28:45.524 --> 28:48.027
>> CAITLYN: Who could it be?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.161
Mara.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.797
>> MARA: How are you?

28:50.797 --> 28:52.098
>> CAITLYN: I am doing great,

28:52.098 --> 28:53.099
sister.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.100
How you doing?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.101
>> MARA: I am doing wonderfully.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.102
>> JENNY: Mara Keisling is

28:56.102 --> 28:57.669
probably the most important

28:57.669 --> 28:59.705
person we have working for us in

28:59.705 --> 29:01.107
Washington.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.574
>> MARA: I think your coming out

29:02.574 --> 29:04.576
has been a huge net positive.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.577
And I think you've screwed

29:05.577 --> 29:07.079
some things up.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.815
But it's also... it's huge.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.082
>> CAITLYN: I-I want you to

29:10.082 --> 29:11.383
know, I'm on your team.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.551
I'll give you my number.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.585
Call me anytime, if there's

29:13.585 --> 29:14.586
anything I can do, um...

29:14.586 --> 29:16.288
>> MARA: I appreciate it.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.124
>> CAITLYN: I know that we got a

29:18.124 --> 29:19.191
long ways to go.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.193
Lot of fighting, lot of

29:21.193 --> 29:23.129
unifying.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.897
It's not gonna be easy, but

29:24.897 --> 29:26.632
we'll get through it.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.134
You know, we have so many

29:28.134 --> 29:29.435
political issues for this

29:29.435 --> 29:30.536
community.

29:30.536 --> 29:33.105
We were talking bathrooms.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.406
What about your experience?

29:34.406 --> 29:35.407
>> MARA: You know, a couple

29:35.407 --> 29:37.376
years ago, we created these

29:37.376 --> 29:38.978
little signs-- "There was just a

29:38.978 --> 29:40.746
trans woman in this bathroom,

29:40.746 --> 29:42.048
and nothing bad happened."

29:42.048 --> 29:43.049
>> CAITLYN: I love that!

29:43.049 --> 29:44.050
I love that!

29:44.050 --> 29:45.051
(laughter)

29:45.051 --> 29:46.052
A little disobedience, girls?

29:46.052 --> 29:47.386
I'd say we go visit some

29:47.386 --> 29:48.387
bathrooms.

29:48.387 --> 29:49.388
What do you say?

29:49.388 --> 29:50.389
>> KATE: I say you're becoming

29:50.389 --> 29:51.390
a leftist activist.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.391
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

29:52.391 --> 29:53.392
>> ELLA: Yay!

29:53.392 --> 29:54.226
>> CAITLYN: Aren't you proud of

29:54.226 --> 29:55.227
me?

29:55.227 --> 29:56.863
>> KATE: It sounds like to me

29:56.863 --> 29:58.397
that we are entering bathrooms

29:58.397 --> 29:59.866
with the intention of creating a

29:59.866 --> 30:00.900
disturbance.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.768
So, you know, seriously, uh,

30:02.768 --> 30:05.271
that could mean arrest.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.907
>> CANDIS: I'm down.

30:07.907 --> 30:08.908
Let's do it.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.910
>> CAITLYN: All right.

30:10.910 --> 30:11.911
>> JENNY: All right, let's do

30:11.911 --> 30:12.912
it.

30:12.912 --> 30:13.913
>> CAITLYN: One for all, all for

30:13.913 --> 30:14.914
one, baby.

30:14.914 --> 30:15.915
We're all together.

30:15.915 --> 30:16.949
>> CHANDI: "Houston, we have a

30:16.949 --> 30:17.950
problem." I love it.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.119
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it!

30:22.955 --> 30:23.956
Candis, where's the place?

30:23.956 --> 30:24.957
Nearby?

30:24.957 --> 30:25.958
>> CANDIS: Nearby.

30:25.958 --> 30:26.959
There's a public park.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.427
>> KIP: Is everybody ready, or

30:28.427 --> 30:29.428
do we need a little prep?

30:29.428 --> 30:30.429
(cheering, laughter)

30:30.429 --> 30:31.430
>> CAITLYN: All right, all

30:31.430 --> 30:32.431
right, all right.

30:32.431 --> 30:33.432
Very good, Kip!

30:33.432 --> 30:34.433
>> CANDIS: I'm so thirsty.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.267
>> CAITLYN: We're gonna be

30:35.267 --> 30:36.102
doing a lot of peeing today.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.103
>> JENNY: Hit me again!

30:37.103 --> 30:40.172
(laughter)

30:40.172 --> 30:41.040
>> CAITLYN: All right, let's do

30:41.040 --> 30:42.041
this, guys.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.042
>> CANDIS: (bleep) me.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.043
>> CAITLYN: (bleep)

30:44.043 --> 30:45.044
Hey, I like that attitude,

30:45.044 --> 30:46.045
girls!

30:46.045 --> 30:47.413
(laughter)

30:47.413 --> 30:48.647
>> CHANDI: All right.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.516
>> ELLA: What should I say?

30:50.516 --> 30:51.884
>> KATE: Uh, "a trans woman was

30:51.884 --> 30:53.585
here and nothing bad happened."

30:53.585 --> 30:54.921
>> CAITLYN: I love that.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.288
>> ELLA: Our first one done.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.389
>> CHANDI: Many to go.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.958
Houston, we really do have a

30:58.958 --> 31:00.092
problem.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.293
Going to the bathroom is

31:01.293 --> 31:03.095
something that everyone does.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.330
>> KIP: Are we hydrated?

31:04.330 --> 31:05.597
>> CHANDI: I'm a little parched.

31:05.597 --> 31:06.532
(smacks lips)

31:06.532 --> 31:07.466
>> ELLA: A little parched.

31:07.466 --> 31:08.434
>> CHANDI: I just want America

31:08.434 --> 31:09.936
to know that trans people are

31:09.936 --> 31:11.670
just looking to do the same

31:11.670 --> 31:13.272
thing in the bathroom.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.474
No one is taking any time to

31:15.474 --> 31:17.676
meet or greet, just potty.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.479
So, just do you in the bathroom,

31:20.479 --> 31:21.680
and let us do us, and then

31:21.680 --> 31:22.748
everybody just smile and walk

31:22.748 --> 31:23.782
out.

31:23.782 --> 31:25.017
(chuckles)

31:25.017 --> 31:26.986
(toilet flushes)

31:31.690 --> 31:32.959
>> JENNY: All right, so this

31:32.959 --> 31:34.860
church has two campuses.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.328
There's a-a prayer service at

31:36.328 --> 31:37.964
one of them tonight.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.298
Let's try to get a little

31:39.298 --> 31:40.332
information, and...

31:40.332 --> 31:41.100
>> CHANDI: Sure.

31:41.100 --> 31:41.767
>> JENNY: ...give-give the

31:41.767 --> 31:42.834
gentleman a call.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.304
>> KATE: We came to Houston to

31:45.304 --> 31:49.341
do something about this city's

31:49.341 --> 31:52.744
response to the hatred,

31:52.744 --> 31:57.149
especially of five pastors who

31:57.149 --> 32:00.052
turned an entire human rights

32:00.052 --> 32:03.289
ordinance into a lie about

32:03.289 --> 32:05.124
bathrooms.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.392
Caitlyn's idea was, "I'll go see

32:06.392 --> 32:07.726
them and talk with them

32:07.726 --> 32:09.061
face-to-face."

32:09.061 --> 32:10.796
(line ringing)

32:10.796 --> 32:11.530
>> WOMAN: Thank you for calling

32:11.530 --> 32:12.564
(bleep) church, how may I help

32:12.564 --> 32:13.532
you?

32:13.532 --> 32:14.533
>> JENNY: Hi there. My name's

32:14.533 --> 32:15.634
Jenny Boylan, I wanted to know

32:15.634 --> 32:17.003
if I could speak with Reverend

32:17.003 --> 32:18.004
(bleep), please?

32:18.004 --> 32:18.837
>> WOMAN: You know, he actually

32:18.837 --> 32:19.838
just stepped out, but I can take

32:19.838 --> 32:21.340
a message and relay it to him.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.508
>> JENNY: Oh, gee, I'm so sorry

32:22.508 --> 32:23.675
he's not available.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.344
I'm in Houston from out of town.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.546
I was hoping to go to, um, a

32:27.546 --> 32:28.647
prayer service?

32:28.647 --> 32:29.781
>> WOMAN: We do have one at the

32:29.781 --> 32:30.816
Houston campus that's at 7:00

32:30.816 --> 32:32.018
p.m.

32:32.018 --> 32:32.884
>> JENNY: I'm, uh, a transgender

32:32.884 --> 32:34.053
woman who's looking for a place

32:34.053 --> 32:35.054
to worship.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.155
Would I be welcome at the ser...

32:36.155 --> 32:37.356
at the, uh, service this

32:37.356 --> 32:40.292
evening?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.294
Oh, wait, hang on, um, uh, my,

32:42.294 --> 32:43.362
uh, my friend Caitlyn Jenner is

32:43.362 --> 32:44.396
here; she'd like to have a word

32:44.396 --> 32:46.365
with you, hang on.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.433
>> CAITLYN: How you doing?

32:47.433 --> 32:50.202
Caitlyn Jenner here.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.837
(line clicks)

32:51.837 --> 32:53.172
(quiet gasping)

32:53.172 --> 32:55.141
>> CANDIS: She got the click.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.842
>> JENNY: I thought that you,

32:56.842 --> 32:58.477
like, everybody just loved you.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.079
>> CAITLYN: That's actually all

33:00.079 --> 33:01.080
the more reason we need to go

33:01.080 --> 33:03.115
tonight.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.088
There it is. That's the church.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.256
My God, look at the size of that

33:10.256 --> 33:11.290
place!

33:11.290 --> 33:12.924
>> JENNY: I'm... petrified.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.526
We're gonna be walking among

33:14.526 --> 33:18.230
people who don't like us.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.632
And we may be provoking trouble.

33:26.705 --> 33:27.706
>> CAITLYN: All the more reason

33:27.706 --> 33:29.375
we need to go tonight, and I-I

33:29.375 --> 33:31.077
would just love to meet him.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.444
I would love his views.

33:32.444 --> 33:33.579
I'm a Christian.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.514
And anybody of faith or a pastor

33:35.514 --> 33:36.648
or this and that are supposed

33:36.648 --> 33:37.649
to be compassionate,

33:37.649 --> 33:38.784
understanding...

33:38.784 --> 33:39.718
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

33:39.718 --> 33:40.486
>> CAITLYN: ...people, and, you

33:40.486 --> 33:41.720
know, you find, I mean, there's

33:41.720 --> 33:42.621
a lot of hate.

33:42.621 --> 33:43.622
>> CHANDI: Lot of hate.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.291
>> ELLA: Scariest part of it is,

33:45.291 --> 33:47.093
they don't see it as hate.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.627
>> CHANDI: And they feel like

33:48.627 --> 33:49.661
it's okay for th-them to

33:49.661 --> 33:51.997
interpret those scriptures in

33:51.997 --> 33:53.799
the ways that work best for

33:53.799 --> 33:54.400
them.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.301
>> CAITLYN: They want, yeah.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.001
>> CHANDI: Right.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.469
And not actually the way it's

33:57.469 --> 33:58.437
meant.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.771
And it's so many ways for us to

33:59.771 --> 34:01.006
interpret it, and why they

34:01.006 --> 34:04.210
choose to use it to attack us is

34:04.210 --> 34:05.177
unbeknownst to me.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.145
>> ELLA: It's sad.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.146
>> CAITLYN: To be honest with

34:07.146 --> 34:08.147
you, I think it was good to get

34:08.147 --> 34:08.914
hung up on.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.249
My experience has been so

34:10.249 --> 34:11.117
positive.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.151
But you realize that I really

34:12.151 --> 34:14.686
haven't seen the hatred out

34:14.686 --> 34:15.821
there.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.789
You can really see, on a much

34:17.789 --> 34:19.158
larger scale, what the rest of

34:19.158 --> 34:20.592
this community is going through.

34:20.592 --> 34:21.593
They're getting hung up on all

34:21.593 --> 34:22.594
the time.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.029
Trying to get a job, trying to

34:24.029 --> 34:26.398
go to a church-- those are the

34:26.398 --> 34:29.168
real big issues.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.137
>> ELLA: Over there.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.674
>> CAITLYN: Girls.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.176
See the big dome over here on

34:37.176 --> 34:38.210
the left?

34:38.210 --> 34:39.378
You can see it sticking up?

34:39.378 --> 34:40.312
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.313
>> CAITLYN: There it is; that's

34:41.313 --> 34:42.914
the church.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.015
My God, look at the size of that

34:44.015 --> 34:45.050
place.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.218
>> CHANDI: In a way...

34:46.218 --> 34:46.985
>> CAITLYN: This is what I

34:46.985 --> 34:47.953
think we do, guys.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.388
We just basically go in, be

34:49.388 --> 34:51.857
quiet, get our little thing, sit

34:51.857 --> 34:53.592
down in the back.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.161
I don't think we have to walk to

34:55.161 --> 34:56.262
the front row.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.697
>> JENNY: I'm... petrified.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.767
>> CAITLYN: Why are you nervous?

35:01.767 --> 35:03.569
>> JENNY: Well, we're gonna be

35:03.569 --> 35:05.937
walking among people who...

35:05.937 --> 35:08.507
don't like us.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.609
As a Christian, I believe that

35:10.609 --> 35:12.478
you have to love your enemies.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.880
We have to meet with the group

35:14.880 --> 35:16.348
of ministers against The Hero

35:16.348 --> 35:17.983
Act who would do us harm.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.084
We have to look them in the

35:19.084 --> 35:21.187
eyes and let them understand we

35:21.187 --> 35:22.721
are good people.

35:22.721 --> 35:23.989
We are filled with love.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.724
And we are no less deserving

35:25.724 --> 35:27.226
than anyone else of the fruits

35:27.226 --> 35:30.196
of... (sighs)

35:30.196 --> 35:31.530
living in this country.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.432
We may be provoking trouble.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.566
>> CHANDI: Well, that would be

35:34.566 --> 35:35.634
every day, Jenny.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.635
>> CAITLYN: Well, I think after

35:36.635 --> 35:37.636
we got hung up on today, I think

35:37.636 --> 35:38.637
they probably know we're in

35:38.637 --> 35:39.638
town.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.639
All right, we're here.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.640
Yeah, just right there is fine.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.742
Here we go.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.977
Let's go in hoping for the best.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.012
>> CANDIS: You're right.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.013
>> JENNY: Let's go with love in

35:48.013 --> 35:49.981
our hearts, yeah.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.024
(car doors opening, closing)

36:07.766 --> 36:08.867
>> CANDIS: There is gonna be a

36:08.867 --> 36:09.868
buzz tonight among the

36:09.868 --> 36:10.869
congregation.

36:10.869 --> 36:11.870
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, everybody

36:11.870 --> 36:12.538
was very nice.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.539
>> CHANDI: They'll remember.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.540
>> JENNY: I thought that was

36:14.540 --> 36:15.541
interesting that in spite of

36:15.541 --> 36:16.542
the church's very anti-trans

36:16.542 --> 36:17.543
message...

36:17.543 --> 36:18.544
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know,

36:18.544 --> 36:19.545
but the people are...

36:19.545 --> 36:20.546
>> JENNY: Many, many people...

36:20.546 --> 36:21.547
>> CAITLYN: But see...

36:21.547 --> 36:22.548
>> JENNY: ...wanted pictures of

36:22.548 --> 36:23.549
you, particularly people under

36:23.549 --> 36:25.984
the age of 13.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.386
>> KATE: We went to two church

36:27.386 --> 36:30.556
services, and the most lively,

36:30.556 --> 36:33.259
loving, cheering, happy response

36:33.259 --> 36:34.960
was when the parishioners saw

36:34.960 --> 36:36.462
that Caitlyn Jenner was in the

36:36.462 --> 36:37.529
house.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.499
And it was all worth it for the

36:40.499 --> 36:43.269
four-minute conversation that

36:43.269 --> 36:46.605
Caitlyn had with the Reverend

36:46.605 --> 36:47.806
(bleep).

36:47.806 --> 36:50.876
Caitlyn said to him, "I need you

36:50.876 --> 36:53.111
to know that your comments on

36:53.111 --> 36:56.181
that video are highly offensive

36:56.181 --> 36:59.285
to me and to all trans people."

36:59.285 --> 37:01.019
And no one has said that to his

37:01.019 --> 37:02.421
face before then.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.555
>> CHANDI: But will they accept

37:03.555 --> 37:05.424
us?

37:05.424 --> 37:06.492
Who knows?

37:06.492 --> 37:07.493
>> CANDIS: But-but by us...

37:07.493 --> 37:08.494
>> CHANDI: That's yet to be

37:08.494 --> 37:09.495
determined.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.496
>> CANDIS: But by us going to

37:10.496 --> 37:12.130
the church tonight, all of those

37:12.130 --> 37:13.532
people are gonna have seen us

37:13.532 --> 37:14.566
there...

37:14.566 --> 37:15.767
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.669
>> CANDIS: ...and thought, "Hey,

37:17.669 --> 37:19.004
they're not that bad."

37:19.004 --> 37:20.005
>> CHANDI: They're not that bad.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.006
>> CANDIS: So maybe we change

37:21.006 --> 37:22.508
one congregation at a time,

37:22.508 --> 37:23.875
instead of one soul at a time.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.210
>> CHANDI: Well, a congregation

37:25.210 --> 37:26.445
is too many!

37:26.445 --> 37:28.447
>> KATE: Our presence in Houston

37:28.447 --> 37:31.350
got some of the haters to meet

37:31.350 --> 37:34.953
trans women and show them that

37:34.953 --> 37:37.856
we can treat them with respect.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.224
I don't know if that'll be

37:39.224 --> 37:41.527
returned, but it planted a seed,

37:41.527 --> 37:43.495
and I'm proud of that.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.132
That's with Caitlyn.

37:47.132 --> 37:48.334
That's what she does.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.936
She goes right up into the face

37:50.936 --> 37:53.339
of whatever's the most scary or

37:53.339 --> 37:54.340
threatening.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.774
She doesn't run away.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.343
It's not her.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.677
That says something.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.912
That's gonna get through.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.549
Maybe not right away, maybe not

38:03.549 --> 38:05.183
even in this generation.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.785
But those kids are gonna grow up

38:06.785 --> 38:09.888
remembering, "I don't hate trans

38:09.888 --> 38:11.790
people."

38:11.790 --> 38:12.991
>> CANDIS: Can I get a

38:12.991 --> 38:13.992
margarita on the rocks with

38:13.992 --> 38:14.993
salt?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.495
>> CHANDI: I want one blended.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.064
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.667
I'm feeling better already!

38:21.667 --> 38:23.802
>> KATE: When I first met you,

38:23.802 --> 38:25.904
you would always distance

38:25.904 --> 38:28.907
yourself from...

38:28.907 --> 38:31.443
your earlier life as a guy.

38:31.443 --> 38:35.781
I've seen wonderful integration

38:35.781 --> 38:37.282
where you found out how to

38:37.282 --> 38:40.085
express yourself more clearly as

38:40.085 --> 38:43.689
a woman and listen as a woman

38:43.689 --> 38:45.391
would listen.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.759
And for that, you've earned my

38:47.759 --> 38:50.596
respect and complete support.

38:50.596 --> 38:53.999
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate that.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.001
>> JENNY: You've learned about

38:56.001 --> 38:58.069
the diversity of our community.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.539
You seem to be beginning to

39:00.539 --> 39:02.641
understand that there's a lot of

39:02.641 --> 39:04.175
ways of being trans, and that

39:04.175 --> 39:05.877
your way is-is one of them.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.078
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.079
>> CANDIS: You know, you're

39:08.079 --> 39:11.417
living proof that it's never too

39:11.417 --> 39:13.485
late to make a change in the

39:13.485 --> 39:14.152
world.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.153
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.422
>> CANDIS: And you're really

39:16.422 --> 39:17.956
just a sweet person on...

39:17.956 --> 39:19.725
on top of it!

39:19.725 --> 39:20.959
>> CAITLYN: Should I lay one on

39:20.959 --> 39:21.760
you again?

39:21.760 --> 39:23.929
(Candis laughs)

39:23.929 --> 39:25.431
Love you.

39:25.431 --> 39:28.900
>> CANDIS: I love you.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.302
>> CHANDI: I appreciate you

39:31.302 --> 39:33.572
stepping out for a community

39:33.572 --> 39:35.641
that still is dealing with a lot

39:35.641 --> 39:39.177
within themselves.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.914
It's so sad that we can't pat

39:42.914 --> 39:45.617
each other on the back and say

39:45.617 --> 39:47.453
"good job" sometimes.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.920
If nobody's told you you're

39:48.920 --> 39:50.589
doing a good job, take it from

39:50.589 --> 39:53.525
me, you're doing a good job.

39:53.525 --> 39:56.762
Regardless of whether you slip

39:56.762 --> 39:59.264
up through a conversation or

39:59.264 --> 40:02.701
whether you, um, say the wrong

40:02.701 --> 40:05.336
thing at the wrong time.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.106
We're not perfect, none of us.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.710
We have our issues, but you

40:11.710 --> 40:14.312
being your authentic self, not

40:14.312 --> 40:15.914
to be the savior for our

40:15.914 --> 40:17.949
community, but to be happy for

40:17.949 --> 40:20.218
yourself, that's what's

40:20.218 --> 40:22.187
important.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.861
>> ELLA: Um...

40:29.861 --> 40:31.429
>> CANDIS: Oh, you're gonna make

40:31.429 --> 40:32.498
me cry.

40:32.498 --> 40:35.467
(Ella chuckles, sniffles)

40:41.740 --> 40:43.875
>> ELLA: You know, as much as I

40:43.875 --> 40:45.477
can go to school, and as much as

40:45.477 --> 40:47.012
even when you do get to that

40:47.012 --> 40:48.346
point where you can have people

40:48.346 --> 40:49.648
accept you and you're living

40:49.648 --> 40:52.083
the life, you always still feel

40:52.083 --> 40:54.686
different, you know?

40:54.686 --> 40:57.956
Meeting all of you made me feel

40:57.956 --> 41:00.258
a new normal.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.227
I...

41:04.362 --> 41:05.931
I thank you.

41:05.931 --> 41:06.965
>> CAITLYN: I'm really gonna

41:06.965 --> 41:08.433
miss you guys.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.101
>> CANDIS: Oh...

41:10.101 --> 41:12.070
>> CAITLYN: We, uh...

41:16.842 --> 41:18.610
We... spent a lot of time

41:18.610 --> 41:20.211
together.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.379
All aboard, ready?

41:21.379 --> 41:22.413
>> SINGER: * Times that I've

41:22.413 --> 41:25.050
seen you lose your way

41:25.050 --> 41:27.118
* You're not in control

41:27.118 --> 41:29.020
And you won't be told... *

41:29.020 --> 41:30.188
>> CAITLYN: We've poured our

41:30.188 --> 41:31.757
hearts out.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.824
>> KATE: We had a mother/son

41:32.824 --> 41:35.727
relationship, and I threw it in

41:35.727 --> 41:36.895
her face.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.063
>> CAITLYN: To be honest with

41:38.063 --> 41:41.366
you, I can't see myself dating,

41:41.366 --> 41:43.702
like, women in the future.

41:43.702 --> 41:45.303
>> SINGER: * All I can do

41:45.303 --> 41:47.806
To keep you safe

41:47.806 --> 41:49.641
* Is hold you close

41:49.641 --> 41:53.044
Hold you close... *

41:53.044 --> 41:54.412
>> CAITLYN: We spoke with

41:54.412 --> 41:56.414
passion, hopefully some respect.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.117
If-if Hillary becomes president,

41:59.117 --> 42:00.385
the country is over.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.386
>> ZACKARY: Where is this anger

42:01.386 --> 42:02.387
coming from?

42:02.387 --> 42:03.454
>> JENNY: We're telling you,

42:03.454 --> 42:04.823
we were scared.

42:04.823 --> 42:05.824
>> CAITLYN: Have I made

42:05.824 --> 42:06.825
mistakes?

42:06.825 --> 42:07.826
Yeah.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.695
Um, but that's okay.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.496
You learn from me, then move on.

42:11.496 --> 42:13.599
I want to apologize.

42:13.599 --> 42:15.834
I did not mean to upset you.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.135
That's what makes our country

42:17.135 --> 42:18.369
great.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.605
That we can have differences of

42:19.605 --> 42:21.039
opinion.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.808
I so appreciate your love and

42:22.808 --> 42:24.375
your support.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.178
It's been overwhelming.

42:27.178 --> 42:30.181
You know, we did good.

42:30.181 --> 42:31.449
>> SINGER: * Hold tight, you're

42:31.449 --> 42:33.719
slowly coming back to life

42:33.719 --> 42:35.987
* I'll be keeping your head up

42:35.987 --> 42:37.488
I'll be keeping your head up,

42:37.488 --> 42:39.658
darling... *

42:39.658 --> 42:40.792
(Caitlyn mumbling)

42:40.792 --> 42:41.860
(laughter)

42:41.860 --> 42:42.828
* I'll be keeping your head

42:42.828 --> 42:43.494
up... *

42:43.494 --> 42:44.195
>> CHANDI: All right...

42:44.195 --> 42:45.063
>> SINGER: * I'll be keeping

42:45.063 --> 42:45.964
your head up... *

42:45.964 --> 42:46.865
(all gasping)

42:46.865 --> 42:49.034
>> CHANDI: Oh...

42:49.034 --> 42:50.068
>> ZACKARY: Wow, that was

42:50.068 --> 42:52.638
pretty monumental.

42:52.638 --> 42:56.474
>> CAITLYN: I always know...

42:56.474 --> 43:00.145
uh, that I have my...

43:00.145 --> 43:02.781
my little group of girls.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.884
They got my back.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.319
(sniffles)

43:08.319 --> 43:10.822
And, uh...

43:10.822 --> 43:13.324
I love you all.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.860
>> CANDIS: We love you, too.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.027
>> KATE: Love you so much.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.996
>> CANDIS: We love you, too.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.333
>> SINGER: * And I won't let you

43:22.333 --> 43:23.334
down. *
