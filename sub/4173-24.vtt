WEBVTT

00:00.741 --> 00:04.110
Hey, Candace. Doing a little
light summer reading, I see.

00:04.112 --> 00:05.953
This is for the book club,
Jeremy and I joined.

00:06.047 --> 00:09.015
We all read the same book, and then
get together and discuss over tea.

00:09.017 --> 00:10.283
Sounds sophisticated.

00:10.285 --> 00:11.751
Yeah, the tea
was my idea.

00:11.753 --> 00:13.720
This week we're
reading, <i>The Iliad.</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:14.854
That's a great book!

00:14.856 --> 00:16.756
It's all about
the Trojan War!

00:16.991 --> 00:18.625
You read this?
BUFORD: We all did.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.293
You're not the only one
with a book club, you know.

00:20.295 --> 00:22.095
I like your idea
about the tea, though.

00:22.097 --> 00:23.095
Ferb, make
a note of that.

00:23.097 --> 00:26.199
The war started because Paris
fell in love with Helen of Troy.

00:26.201 --> 00:26.999
It's so romantic.

00:27.001 --> 00:31.271
Yeah, and Helen could launch a
thousand ships with her face!

00:31.273 --> 00:32.906
My favorite character
was Achilles,

00:32.908 --> 00:35.141
the greatest Greek
warrior of all time.

00:35.143 --> 00:36.910
He had this big
fight with Hector.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.745
He was all,
wham! Bam!

00:38.747 --> 00:40.046
Stab! Stab! Stab!
Cut it out!

00:40.048 --> 00:42.015
Isn't there something
about a wooden horse?

00:42.017 --> 00:44.918
Yeah, the Greek army built
a huge wooden horse

00:44.920 --> 00:47.220
and left it outside
the gates of Troy.

00:47.222 --> 00:49.589
<i>The Trojans thought that</i>
<i>the Greeks had given up</i>

00:49.591 --> 00:51.858
<i>and that the horse was</i>
<i>some sort of tribute to them.</i>

00:51.860 --> 00:52.858
So, they wheeled
it inside the gates.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.729
Hey. How did they get that
big horse in that tiny door?

00:56.731 --> 00:59.199
Buford, just try
imaging a larger door.

00:59.201 --> 01:00.767
Oh, okay. Hang on.

01:02.002 --> 01:02.801
Oh, yeah.
That's better.

01:02.803 --> 01:05.905
Then late at night, the Greeks climbed
out of the horse, opened the gates...

01:05.907 --> 01:08.141
Then it was all, wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.

01:08.143 --> 01:09.209
Cut it out!

01:09.211 --> 01:11.010
Wow, really
sounds exciting.

01:11.012 --> 01:11.710
I better
get started.

01:11.712 --> 01:14.247
Book club is in
three hours. Bye!

01:14.249 --> 01:16.382
Wow. She must
be a fast reader.

01:16.784 --> 01:17.917
What gets me is,

01:17.919 --> 01:19.786
why did the Trojan
War take so long?

01:19.788 --> 01:22.055
If I were Achilles, I could
have taken the city of Troy

01:22.057 --> 01:23.857
like in one afternoon.

01:23.859 --> 01:25.992
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today!

01:25.994 --> 01:28.128
We're gonna finally
recreate the Trojan War.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.663
I'll be Paris because my
name starts with a "P."

01:30.665 --> 01:32.098
And I'll be
Helen because

01:32.100 --> 01:35.001
uh, my name
starts with "I"

01:35.003 --> 01:37.237
which is right
after "H."

01:37.404 --> 01:39.372
And I'll be the
great Achilles!

01:39.374 --> 01:41.374
And I'll be all wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.

01:41.376 --> 01:43.009
(SCREAMS)
Cut it out!

01:43.011 --> 01:44.944
And you can be Hector.
Now get over there.

01:44.946 --> 01:46.079
I'm taking Ferb.

01:46.081 --> 01:48.281
Hey everyone, can I play?
BUFORD: No!

01:48.283 --> 01:49.916
I've got baklava.

01:49.918 --> 01:51.651
Welcome to the
Greek army.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.187
You know who loves history
and historical reenactments.

01:54.189 --> 01:56.055
Hey, where's
your dad?

01:56.857 --> 01:58.258
DAD: So it goes over,

01:58.260 --> 02:00.160
under, around and through.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.961
(INHALES)
Oh, lovely.

02:01.963 --> 02:03.429
Time to open the shop.

02:11.238 --> 02:12.405

02:32.928 --> 02:36.329
<i>We're still awaiting a surveillance

02:36.331 --> 02:38.898
<i>Hey, Carl! Any news
from Team Cockroach?</i>

02:38.900 --> 02:41.340
CARL: <i>Nothing yet, sir. We think
they may have been scattered.</i>

02:44.805 --> 02:46.105
<i>Quite frankly,</i>
<i>we fear the worst.</i>

02:46.107 --> 02:46.905
<i>Which isn't that bad.</i>

02:46.907 --> 02:49.075
<i>They're just a bunch</i>
<i>of roaches after all.</i>

02:49.077 --> 02:50.710
<i>So we're gonna need you</i>
<i>to get over to Doof</i>

02:50.712 --> 02:52.712

02:52.714 --> 02:53.846
<i>Good luck, Agent P.</i>

02:56.784 --> 02:59.118
And they say Rome
wasn't built in a day.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.988
Uh, technically, that's not Rome,
that's supposed to be Troy.

03:01.990 --> 03:04.190
If I wanted nerd facts,
I would have kept Baljeet.

03:04.192 --> 03:08.861
In case you are wondering, the word you
are looking for is "impenetrable."

03:08.863 --> 03:11.831
Actually, the word I was
looking for is "decimate."

03:11.833 --> 03:12.966
Fair enough.

03:13.334 --> 03:15.034
Yeah, we're gonna need
a bigger army.

03:15.036 --> 03:17.136
Irving, break out my
recruitin' fustanella.

03:17.138 --> 03:18.304
You mean the
little Greek skirt?

03:18.306 --> 03:19.739
It's a fustanella!

03:24.512 --> 03:27.180
Coming! Hold on!
Just hold your horses!

03:27.182 --> 03:28.381
Wait... Hello?

03:30.951 --> 03:33.052
Ha! You missed me,
Perry the Platypus!

03:33.454 --> 03:35.188
But I got you!

03:35.190 --> 03:38.191
You see, I was just doing a little
inventory and reorganization

03:38.193 --> 03:41.928
of all the stuff that I've
collected over the last 40 years.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.531
Yeah, I know it's gotten
a little out of hand.

03:45.533 --> 03:48.801
I kinda let it go and Norm's
been in Maui for, like, a month.

03:48.803 --> 03:50.236
So I made
the De-clutterinator.

03:50.238 --> 03:52.305
I was actually gonna
shoot myself with it,

03:52.307 --> 03:55.275
which would make me want to
unclutter everything, and,

03:55.277 --> 03:57.443
uh, then I lost it,
'cause, you know, it's...

03:57.445 --> 03:59.012
It's really cluttered
in here.

03:59.014 --> 04:00.880
So then I hired a nice
young lady named Doreen

04:00.882 --> 04:04.050
to help me get organized, and, well, I
think she may have gotten lost, too.

04:04.052 --> 04:05.852
I haven't seen her in days.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.487
Doreen, are you out there?

04:07.855 --> 04:10.156
DOREEN: So thirsty.

04:10.158 --> 04:12.325
I never approved overtime!

04:13.294 --> 04:14.560
DOREEN: Food.

04:14.562 --> 04:18.131
So, if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to my search for Doreen.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.334
Maybe I'll get lucky and find
the De-clutterinator, too.

04:21.336 --> 04:24.270
Hey, Doreen! Marco!

04:24.872 --> 04:25.972
DOREEN: Water.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.540
Yeah, she really
stinks at this.

04:27.908 --> 04:29.208
Okay, next!

04:29.843 --> 04:31.311

Balthazar Horowitz.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.013
But you can call me
the Ball Pit Kid.

04:34.015 --> 04:35.148

04:35.150 --> 04:36.282

04:43.591 --> 04:45.058

04:45.060 --> 04:46.926
Actually, I am Greek.
I was born on the island...

the Trojan War? Like in my book?

09:07.421 --> 09:09.555
Doreen, come on,
quit kidding around.

09:09.557 --> 09:11.157
(GASPS)
Perry the Platypus?

09:11.159 --> 09:12.592
You've found the
De-clutterinator!

09:12.594 --> 09:13.859
Excellent,
okay, shoot me.

09:13.861 --> 09:15.795
Shoot me and I'll clean
this whole place up.

09:15.797 --> 09:16.595
Oh wait.
(STAMMERS) What?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.631
Oh, it's not plugged in.
Hold on one sec.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.534
My, word! What a mess.

09:22.102 --> 09:23.736
Okay, here's an open socket.

09:24.371 --> 09:25.705
That doesn't sound good.

09:25.707 --> 09:26.806
(EXPLOSION)

09:29.109 --> 09:33.112
Oof, I say, I feel the
sudden urge to declutter.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.284
Well, you have to admit it
did get rid of the clutter.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.518
There you are.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.153
Doreen!
What's happening?

09:41.155 --> 09:44.223
My invoice. You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

09:44.358 --> 09:46.258
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

09:46.727 --> 09:49.595
And there goes
the last of it!

09:52.499 --> 09:54.767
Lawrence, what are
you doing out here?

09:54.769 --> 09:56.902
Oh, you know, just
tidying up a little.

09:56.904 --> 09:58.704
Well, the yard
looks great!

09:58.706 --> 09:59.704
Come on in the kitchen.

09:59.706 --> 10:01.607
I've got a plate of cake
that needs cleaning up.

10:01.609 --> 10:02.875
I'm your man.

10:06.313 --> 10:08.514
Now that we're all here.
Who wants to go first.

10:08.516 --> 10:11.283
Ooh, me! In general I thought
the Greeks' decoy platypus

10:11.285 --> 10:14.286
was a brilliant idea until it
got smashed by the T. rex!

10:14.288 --> 10:16.422
Its use of lasers to
destroy the city of Troy

10:16.424 --> 10:19.825
really seemed unbeatable until Paris
flew down in his laser chariot.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.428
The flying chariots were
all, pew, pew, pew, pew!

10:22.430 --> 10:23.663
Ga, ga, ga, ga!

10:23.665 --> 10:25.431
And... (IMITATES
BOMBS FALLING) Cool!

10:25.433 --> 10:27.233
<i>The Iliad </i> is truly an epic!

10:27.235 --> 10:29.802
Candace, you didn't
read the book, did you?

10:30.170 --> 10:30.869
I'm so busted.

10:30.871 --> 10:33.039
Oh, that's okay. I don't
think anyone did.

10:33.641 --> 10:35.174
I just come to book
club for the tea.
