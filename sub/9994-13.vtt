00:01.700 --> 00:02.800
I don't understand.

00:03.100 --> 00:04.600
I thought you said
she was getting better.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.600
She fooled us.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.700
The leukemia fooled us.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.800
For a while it seemed
like she was responding

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I don't know if her system
can take another

00:27.100 --> 00:28.300
I'm so sorry.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.000
I'll make it a point
to stop back

00:43.300 --> 00:44.200
Wow.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.800
How long was I out?

00:48.200 --> 00:49.300
Just a few minutes.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.200
It's weird
the way you do that.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
So sudden.

00:53.900 --> 00:54.700
Hmm.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.200
Mom and Dad went
to grab a bite.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.100
Hey. I almost forgot.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.100
(gasping):
No!

01:13.300 --> 01:15.400
Where in the hell
did you find him?

01:18.900 --> 01:21.200
Hmm. He looks as old

01:24.000 --> 01:27.100
Yeah, that German shepherd
really did a number on him, huh?

01:36.700 --> 01:37.500
It's okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.100
Sorry.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.300
(weakly):
I get so tired.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.900
It's okay.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.200
WOMAN:
You girls decent in there?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hell, no.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.900
We're Dubois women.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.200
Was she out the whole time?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.400
30 seconds ago,
she was laughing.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.500
The chemo's just completely
knocked the crap out of her.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.400
Doctor came by.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.500
Said it wasn't really helping.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.300
Did Marie hear?

02:26.500 --> 02:27.700
No.

02:31.000 --> 02:31.900
Ariel...

02:32.600 --> 02:33.900
Do me a favor.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.400
You've got to go outside,
call Bridgette.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.000
Okay? Tell her we need her.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.000
Daddy or I will pick her
up at the airport,

02:48.800 --> 02:50.600
(sobbing)
Okay? Tonight.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.900
ALLISON:
Shh.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.100
I'm going to miss
her so much.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.400
I don't know if I can
live without her.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.400
Hi. You're there.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.900
This is Allison Dubois.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.700
bring in my youngest daughter in

04:33.600 --> 04:35.600
11:00. Thank you.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.000
Bye.
(phone beeps off)

04:38.100 --> 04:39.200
Hey.
Hey.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.500
Woke up.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.600
Your side of the
bed was empty.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.600
Cold. How long
you been up?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.200
I don't know.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.400
I think Marie's coming down
with something.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.400
Is it serious?

04:55.400 --> 04:56.300
I hope not.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.800
She seems fine now.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.800
I'm just going
to keep her home

05:02.000 --> 05:03.300
and run her by the doctor.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.300
ALL:
God, grant me the serenity

05:09.200 --> 05:11.600
courage to change
the things I can,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.100
and wisdom to know
the difference.

SCANLON:
 <i>I just think it's weird,</i>

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
to make sure I'm going
to be at the meeting,

05:21.300 --> 05:22.600
Gary's a recovering addict.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.100
Reliability is not
our strong suit.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
He's going to do
what he's going to do.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.300
You're his sponsor,
not his mother.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.900
Long as you're there
when he <i>does</i> show up.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
The rest is up to him.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.100
That's Gary's car.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.500
MAN:
 <i>Good news.</i>

05:50.000 --> 05:52.200
There's no strep.
No fever.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.200
Her inoculations are up to date.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.400
The truth is...

05:55.800 --> 05:56.800
She looks super.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.700
 Okay.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.000
So I'm... I'm a little unclear.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.300
For day care? For camp?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.000
Is there something
you want me to sign?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.700
I need you to talk
to me about leukemia.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
Leukemia?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.100
Are we still talking
about Marie?

06:17.200 --> 06:18.800
Well, ah...

06:19.900 --> 06:21.700
Wh-what would you like to know?

06:22.400 --> 06:23.600
Has she been tired?

06:23.900 --> 06:25.000
She doesn't look tired.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.700
I didn't notic
any swelling

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Allison, leukemia's
a hell of a rabbit

06:40.700 --> 06:41.500
Hi, Jen?

06:42.100 --> 06:43.900
Uh, could you come
in here for a second

06:45.700 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, keep an eye
on her for a minute,

06:49.800 --> 06:51.400
No, no, I... I know.

06:53.000 --> 06:53.800
Thank you.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.500
Okay, baby, Mommy's
gonna come get you

07:04.200 --> 07:05.800
Okay.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.700
Allison, look,
I know you know this,

07:12.200 --> 07:14.500
Leukemia is not something
she's going to catch

07:14.800 --> 07:16.400
You've never mentioned
a family history of it.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.400
come up in conversation
about the other girls.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.800
Someone on your husband's side?

07:24.900 --> 07:26.300
that you can get
in front of it?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.100
Treat it
 <i>before</i> it strikes?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.400
Allison, what you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.100
before they have them.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.000
Before they have them
there is nothing to treat.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.200
It's already in there
waiting to happen, right?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.300
But that's kind
of a simple way of...

07:47.600 --> 07:48.800
Or my mother had had it?

07:49.400 --> 07:50.800
Aren't there things
you would be doing?

07:51.100 --> 07:53.900
Tests you would be running
to keep an eye on it

07:54.100 --> 07:56.200
But you don't
have it,

07:58.300 --> 07:59.100
Allison.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.900
The kind of tests
you're talking about

08:03.600 --> 08:06.200
Painful. It's not something
you'd want done to a child

08:08.400 --> 08:09.600
And they're expensive.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.100
unless there's some
credible diagnostic rationale.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.100
You know, forgive
my asking this,

08:18.700 --> 08:19.600
Talking to me about this?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
I didn't want to alarm him

08:27.200 --> 08:28.900
Allison, I have to be
honest with you,

08:31.600 --> 08:35.100
?????????if I didn't knowou
as well as I do,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.799
I would be tempted
to pick up the phone

08:39.500 --> 08:42.299
All right, so here's
what I'm willing to do.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.200
Let's draw some blood.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.800
Okay? We'll send it
to the lab.

08:47.300 --> 08:50.300
That is the first place
we would see

08:51.700 --> 08:52.500
SCANLON:
 <i>Gary, it's Lee.</i>

08:54.400 --> 08:56.800
I'm worried about you and I'm
wondering what you're doing.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
Call me. Let me know
you're all right.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.100
(whispering):
Are you staying

09:08.700 --> 09:11.300
Sorry. I lost track of time.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.100
I appreciate this,
Earl. Like I said,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.500
I'm just concerned
about my friend.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.800
(knocking)
Gary? Anyone?

10:13.000 --> 10:13.900
Hello?

10:16.100 --> 10:18.400
I've got Marie's tests back,
and, uh, 

10:18.600 --> 10:21.600
I have to tell you
that little girl

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
If there's anything in her blood

10:24.800 --> 10:28.000
modern science can't currently
see it, much less treat it.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.800
Will she be healthy
15 or 20 years from now?

10:31.300 --> 10:32.600
 <i>Nobody knows that.</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:35.100
 <i>But now that I know</i>
 <i>it's an issue for you,</i>

10:37.600 --> 10:40.900
 <i>Allison, any one</i>
 <i>of our kids could get hit</i>

10:42.100 --> 10:44.200
 <i>It's how we love them</i>
 <i>while they're here.</i>

10:44.500 --> 10:45.600
 <i>While we're here.</i>

10:46.100 --> 10:47.700
 <i>Well, anyway,</i>
 <i>you get the point.</i>

10:47.900 --> 10:50.000
 <i>Right now, she's the living</i>
 <i>definition of healthy</i>

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Hey...
I'm home too.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.000
All the really big bosses
are away at a seminar,

11:00.200 --> 11:01.900
that I can't do at home
on my laptop.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.300
She's a very good monkey.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.500
You got cake?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.900
Is it somebody's birthday?

11:10.100 --> 11:12.300
Celebrating just to celebrate.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.600
Cool.

11:14.700 --> 11:15.700
Mmm... yum.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.700
What's the occasion?

11:18.100 --> 11:20.800
You know, one day, you're
feeling kind of down...

11:23.200 --> 11:24.400
(dog growling)
Hey, get out of here!

11:24.700 --> 11:25.500
Get out!
(dog growling)

11:27.700 --> 11:30.100
Hey, kids! Get away
from that dog!

11:30.600 --> 11:31.700
Let him go, Ariel!

11:33.300 --> 11:35.800
Ariel! Ariel!
Just let the dog have it!

11:36.500 --> 11:38.000
Ariel, get inside!

11:44.100 --> 11:46.600
Doggy hurt Mr. Snookie.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.200
Ariel saved Mr. Snookie.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.300
What were you thinking, Ariel?

11:53.600 --> 11:56.000
He could have attacked you.
He could have bitten you.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.300
You act like that to save
one of your sisters,

12:01.700 --> 12:03.000
not a teddy bear.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.500
Okay?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.900
Hey...
Are you okay?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.600
Honey, why the long face?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.600
Everybody's doing just fine.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.100
Everybody's fine.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.900
JOE:
Leukemia?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.100
She was 20, maybe 21.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.000
But the doctor said she's fine.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.900
Yes, today. Yes, now.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.400
Okay, then, uh...
wait, I don't understand.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.900
The doctor said she's fine.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.300
And for now, she is.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.000
He didn't say
she would always be fine.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.200
But I know that.

12:51.900 --> 12:52.800
No, Allison.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.400
Just got torn up
a few hours ago.

12:56.700 --> 12:57.600
Please listen to yourself.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.800
You're not listening!

13:01.200 --> 13:02.600
That torn-up teddy bear

13:03.000 --> 13:04.400
has everything
to do with everything.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.700
I saw it last night

13:07.000 --> 13:08.500
before it happened,

13:08.700 --> 13:10.100
in the same dream

13:10.400 --> 13:13.200
that I saw
our youngest daughter...

13:14.500 --> 13:15.600
dying.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.700
Ariel

13:20.100 --> 13:21.800
and you found that torn-up
teddy bear,

13:23.200 --> 13:26.300
and that's how I know this
is going to happen, you see?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.400
Actually, Allison,
you're not making any sense.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.200
After all this time,

13:34.100 --> 13:36.300
You don't believe
in the things that I see?

13:36.500 --> 13:38.000
Or the things th I feel?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.400
I absolutely
believe in you.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.200
I'm not questioning
what you see.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.300
I'll prove
it to you.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.800
Joe!

13:52.100 --> 13:53.100
What are you doing?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.300
What are you talking about?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.000
and I'm gonna burn it
in the backyard.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.200
Don't you see?

14:03.500 --> 14:05.100
Look, according to your logic,

14:08.300 --> 14:10.200
then there's nothing for
Ariel to give to Marie

14:11.500 --> 14:13.300
so maybe she's not
in the hospital,

14:15.200 --> 14:16.500
(whispers):
You're mocking me.

14:17.900 --> 14:18.800
No!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.700
I am trying to
get you to see

14:22.000 --> 14:25.500
how irrational
and potentially dangerous,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.600
Look, Allison, hey.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Look, listen,
listen, sweetie,

14:32.300 --> 14:34.100
look, you may be
right about this.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.200
She may be fated to die
before her time,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.500
but what's the point of living

14:40.400 --> 14:42.100
for her and for us,

14:42.500 --> 14:45.100
if her whole life
is spent chasing a tragedy

14:45.300 --> 14:48.100
that we're not sure
is ever really gonna happen,

14:48.200 --> 14:51.200
and which for the
time being we can

14:51.600 --> 14:53.000
I won't do it!

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
and I will burn it
in the biggest bonfire

14:57.800 --> 15:01.300
if it will convince you
to forget about what you saw

15:03.600 --> 15:04.800
until it
actually happens,

15:06.400 --> 15:08.800
till there's something
that we can do about it.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.400
Do you have any idea
what you're asking of me?!

15:32.700 --> 15:33.700
I don't know if I can!

15:36.100 --> 15:37.100
You're missing the point.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.800
Everything <i>is</i> fine.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.600
That's how life works.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.800
Everything is fine
until it isn't,

15:46.600 --> 15:48.000
Otherwise, there is no life.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.500
What the hell is Willow Elm?

16:00.400 --> 16:01.200
Huh?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.400
Some sort of a tree?

16:06.300 --> 16:08.600
No, I wasn't.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.300
What are you doing?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.900
It's a quarter
after 5:00.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.500
Come back to bed.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.400
I can't sleep.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.300
I keep thinking
about this kid.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
Met him at my
NA meeting.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.100
He OD'd yesterday.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.600
I'm sorry.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.200
I have to call his folks
and tell them.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.200
They're back east in Delaware,
two hours ahead of us.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.000
I'm figuring 5:30 here,
7:30 there.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.099
I'm dreading it.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.400
I'll sit with you.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.400
I'll help you through it.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.099
DOCTOR:
 <i>I'm afraid</i>

17:30.200 --> 17:31.700
What about more chemo?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.600
See, there's a tipping point
with the chemo,

17:38.500 --> 17:41.100
where the cure
is worse than the disease

17:41.500 --> 17:43.400
and we've passed
that point, I'm afraid.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.700
So what do we do?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.000
You gather
your loved ones,

17:48.100 --> 17:50.000
and you say your good-byes.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.200
This is our fault, you know?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.800
I knew it. I told you

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
we should not have stayed
in that house.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.700
(sobbing):
We should not have stayed

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
You okay?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.300
I'm fine.

18:23.700 --> 18:24.900
Actually, I'm good.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.200
You're right.
None of it means anything

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
What?

18:37.100 --> 18:38.000
?????????

18:42.261 --> 18:43.261
I don't understand.

18:45.361 --> 18:46.861
that is going
to make Marie sick?

18:47.331 --> 18:48.431
Is this about mold?

18:48.731 --> 18:50.031
Is this about radon?

18:50.531 --> 18:52.531
It's not like
we're close to

18:52.731 --> 18:54.431
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

18:54.631 --> 18:57.031
What you need to know
is we need to get our

18:57.931 --> 18:59.131
Allison, whoa!

18:59.931 --> 19:01.931
Do you understand
what you're saying: "move"?

19:02.531 --> 19:04.131
It's... it's not that easy.

19:04.831 --> 19:06.931
Finding a new house takes time.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.631
I don't even know
what this place is worth.

19:11.831 --> 19:12.931
People do it every day.

19:13.331 --> 19:15.731
Yeah, people do it every day,
Allison,

19:15.931 --> 19:17.431
but nobody does it <i>in</i> a day.

19:20.231 --> 19:21.431
"Willow Elm."

19:22.531 --> 19:23.331
What?

19:23.831 --> 19:25.431
Willow Elm's the answer.

19:26.231 --> 19:27.331
 <i>Now what you're walking through</i>

19:27.531 --> 19:30.731
is the "Hacienda" model
of Phase 3 here at Willow Elm.

19:31.931 --> 19:34.231
We've got 108 acres here,

19:34.731 --> 19:37.831
over $400 million
in construction...

19:38.831 --> 19:40.631
Bunford Properties'
biggest project to date.

19:42.731 --> 19:43.531
Thank you.

19:43.931 --> 19:46.731
Obviously, there's all kinds
of upgrades and options available.

19:47.431 --> 19:48.231
Take a look around.

19:49.031 --> 19:51.231
Any of my salespeople
will be happy to answer

19:52.831 --> 19:56.831
And please, feel free to call me
or e-mail me directly.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.531
It's perfect.

20:00.031 --> 20:00.931
You don't
really know that.

20:02.331 --> 20:05.031
You just spent
20 minutes in a model home.

20:05.331 --> 20:07.531
That hardly constitutes
a thorough evaluation.

20:09.331 --> 20:10.631
It's where we're
supposed to be.

20:12.631 --> 20:14.131
we don't even know
if we can afford it.

20:16.431 --> 20:17.431
It's our child!

20:20.831 --> 20:22.031
tied up in that house.

20:23.831 --> 20:24.731
No, the logical thing?

20:26.731 --> 20:29.231
The instant you find out
your child is in peril

20:32.931 --> 20:35.031
and you screw
the money!

20:35.631 --> 20:37.331
I don't understand!

20:39.931 --> 20:40.931
as if it isn't real.

20:43.531 --> 20:44.931
No, don't do that!

20:46.731 --> 20:49.131
I am sending our child
off to a certain death

20:51.531 --> 20:53.331
and see if any of
this makes sense!

20:56.431 --> 20:57.531
'cause I am here!

20:58.731 --> 21:02.131
I took the morningoff work
I am in this with you!

21:02.431 --> 21:05.131
Someone has to ask
these questions!

21:12.331 --> 21:13.531
So I have a question.

21:14.631 --> 21:16.131
Who's going to call
the Realtor?

21:18.231 --> 21:20.231
I don't understand.
What's the mystery?

21:20.531 --> 21:22.731
Kid was a drug addict.
He died of an overdose.

21:24.031 --> 21:25.631
I need you to perform
another autopsy.

21:26.231 --> 21:30.531
Just because somebody
wona free one during

21:32.231 --> 21:33.131
I knew this kid.

21:34.831 --> 21:35.731
They made me promise.

21:37.131 --> 21:39.431
The overdose thing--
it just doesn't add up for them.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.631
Wow, parents don't believe
their baby's a junkie.

21:44.231 --> 21:45.631
No, they knew
their kid had a history,

21:48.931 --> 21:50.931
They just don't believe he
wouldn't know what he was taking

21:51.831 --> 21:54.831
I see, so the city of Phoenix 
is going to pay for an autopsy

22:02.731 --> 22:03.631
Please?

22:06.631 --> 22:09.931
If we're getting a new house,
who's gonna live here?

22:10.531 --> 22:11.631
Excellent question.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.831
She's gonna stop by tomorrow
and take a look,

22:15.831 --> 22:16.831
Uh-huh.

22:17.431 --> 22:21.831
So if me and Marie
are getting our own rooms,

22:22.031 --> 22:23.831
then maybe we should leave
the bunk beds here

22:26.931 --> 22:31.231
I mean, they're gonna have
kids, too, right?

22:41.231 --> 22:42.631
I don't think I can do it.

22:49.931 --> 22:53.231
Look, truth be told,
I don't want to move.

22:54.531 --> 22:55.631
I mean, I will
if I have to,

22:58.231 --> 23:00.231
we don't know for sure
that it's poisoned.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.231
I mean, maybe it's not
poisoned yet.

23:02.931 --> 23:05.131
Maybe that's something
that happens in the future.

23:06.031 --> 23:06.831
Are you kidding?

23:08.831 --> 23:10.031
Well, I don't
know, Allison.

23:10.531 --> 23:12.031
First you tell me
we got to move

23:12.231 --> 23:14.131
because our daughter's
going to get sick and die,

23:14.331 --> 23:15.831
and then you tell me
that you don't want to move

23:16.931 --> 23:18.331
of somebody else
getting sick and dying.

23:21.231 --> 23:23.231
'cause I can't seem
to find one thatorks.

23:24.931 --> 23:26.531
We cannot afford to move

23:29.731 --> 23:31.131
Do you understand that?

23:32.231 --> 23:34.431
We can't, in good conscience,

23:35.831 --> 23:37.731
not to a family
with small children,

23:39.331 --> 23:40.431
God, I hate this!

23:40.631 --> 23:43.831
I'm sorry.
I don't share your sense

23:46.931 --> 23:48.131
What are you talking about?

23:48.631 --> 23:49.631
When we bought
this house

23:51.731 --> 23:53.531
of the people who sold it to us,
clean.

23:55.831 --> 23:57.831
As a homeowner,
I got a responsibility

24:00.231 --> 24:03.031
to test it from time to time
to make repairs,

24:04.431 --> 24:05.631
We'll get the
house tested.

24:06.431 --> 24:07.431
We'll call someone in.

24:09.231 --> 24:12.131
We'll do everything we can
to make sure

24:13.231 --> 24:15.031
I think that's all
that anyone can expect.

24:17.931 --> 24:18.831
I don't know.

24:20.331 --> 24:21.531
Or we stay.

24:22.931 --> 24:24.931
And we never speak
another word about it.

24:28.131 --> 24:30.731
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>I heard he died</i>

24:30.931 --> 24:33.231
Really? Is that
what you heard, huh?

24:33.731 --> 24:34.731
I'm just telling you.

24:36.831 --> 24:37.831
There it is, Detective.

24:38.731 --> 24:41.031
Thanks, I'll try
and bring it back

25:15.831 --> 25:17.831
I have been waiting for days,
Doctor!

25:18.831 --> 25:22.831
Mrs. Dubois, as my staff
has repeatedly explained to you,

25:23.331 --> 25:25.931
hospital hours are for surgeries
and follow-ups.

25:28.531 --> 25:30.631
Now, as soon as I have
some office hours free,

25:33.431 --> 25:36.031
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm on my way to surgery.

25:40.231 --> 25:41.431
Would you say
that is more

25:44.031 --> 25:46.731
Mrs. Dubois, you are violating
the restraining order.

25:49.731 --> 25:51.531
I don't want
to call the police.

25:52.631 --> 25:55.531
Honestly, all of this
is unnecessary.

25:56.231 --> 25:57.831
I told you how sorry I am.

25:58.731 --> 25:59.731
I-I explained

26:01.331 --> 26:03.131
Well, see,
I don't see it that way!

26:03.731 --> 26:05.831
You were there
from the beginning.

26:07.431 --> 26:10.031
How many more people are going
to die because of you?!

26:10.231 --> 26:11.231
Mrs. Dubois,

26:11.531 --> 26:12.631
this has to stop.

26:13.331 --> 26:14.831
If you'd like to contact me,

26:27.479 --> 26:28.979
Someone looks unhappy.

26:30.279 --> 26:31.679
Mm, let's review.

26:33.279 --> 26:35.579
As of today, our youngest
daughter has been given

26:38.579 --> 26:41.179
our house has also
been given a clean

26:42.179 --> 26:47.179
our real estate broker just
this evening has assured us

26:50.379 --> 26:54.079
to begin 30 years
of new debt

26:56.079 --> 26:57.279
Have I skipped
anything?

26:57.579 --> 27:00.079
Left any bad news out?

27:05.979 --> 27:07.979
What if I'm wrong
about everything?

27:08.579 --> 27:11.879
Wow, a moment
of self-doubt.

27:12.679 --> 27:15.179
That's new.
That's different.

27:16.579 --> 27:17.979
I kind of like it.

27:21.879 --> 27:24.379
What if I make us
go through all of this moving,

27:25.179 --> 27:26.479
making new friends,

27:27.579 --> 27:30.179
shaking everything up
when I was already just fine,

27:31.779 --> 27:33.179
and it's all for nothing?

27:33.579 --> 27:34.779
Then we'll just
have to tough it out.

27:35.579 --> 27:38.579
You know, bigger bathrooms,
nicer bedrooms,

27:39.479 --> 27:40.579
modern kitchen.

27:42.479 --> 27:46.379
And if at some point
I can free our daughters

27:49.779 --> 27:51.679
perhaps we'll find a way
 forgive you. 

27:52.879 --> 27:53.679
Hmm.

27:59.079 --> 28:00.379
SCANLON:
 <i>New house? That's exciting.</i>

28:02.479 --> 28:03.979
at the sales office
in an hour.

28:04.379 --> 28:06.179
I mean, we still have
to sell our old place.

28:08.379 --> 28:09.679
Or we could
still fall through.

28:10.379 --> 28:13.679
No, I can see how busy you are.
I appreciate you doing this.

28:14.379 --> 28:16.379
I'm happy to see
whoever you like,

28:19.079 --> 28:20.179
Now, who's this again?

28:20.379 --> 28:21.379
Gary's roommate.

28:21.579 --> 28:22.579
He's finally
back in town.

28:23.479 --> 28:24.679
see if he could
shed some light.

28:25.179 --> 28:26.479
Nice kid.
Pretty upset.

28:27.279 --> 28:28.679
Apparently,
they were very close.

28:30.179 --> 28:32.779
This is the woman from
the District Attorney's office

28:35.679 --> 28:37.979
Allison Dubois,
David Channing.

28:38.579 --> 28:39.379
Hi.

28:39.679 --> 28:40.579
Doctor...

28:43.979 --> 28:44.779
Are you okay?

28:45.579 --> 28:46.579
I'm sorry.

28:48.179 --> 28:51.679
You just bear an
uncanny resemblance

28:53.079 --> 28:54.579
Of course, he's
a bit older than you.

28:55.279 --> 28:56.679
He could almost
be your father.

28:57.579 --> 29:00.379
He's not my father.
My father's a postman.

29:01.679 --> 29:03.579
Now, look, David
is a medical student.

29:04.379 --> 29:07.679
 Yeah, although I don't think
oncology's in my future.

29:08.679 --> 29:09.879
I don't think I'd enjoy knowing

29:11.679 --> 29:13.579
already had
a fatal disease, you know?

29:15.979 --> 29:16.979
But you never know.

29:17.479 --> 29:18.679
Yeah, you never know.

29:21.279 --> 29:23.379
I really have to get
these across town.

29:23.879 --> 29:25.779
Of course.
I just wanted

29:26.279 --> 29:27.879
Uh, give me a second
to walk her out.

29:30.879 --> 29:31.879
Nice meeting you.

29:33.279 --> 29:34.379
Talk to me.
What'd you see?

29:34.879 --> 29:35.679
It's nothing.

29:37.679 --> 29:38.579
What are you talking about?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.379
It's nothing.

29:41.679 --> 29:42.679
It's personal.

29:42.879 --> 29:44.979
A really weird coincidence.

29:45.379 --> 29:46.779
I really got to go.

29:46.979 --> 29:47.979
All right,
I apprecia it.

29:51.279 --> 29:53.479
 <i>Are you aware that Gary</i>
 <i>had a history with narcotics?</i>

29:53.679 --> 29:55.079
Yeah, we were friends.

29:55.279 --> 29:58.879
I mean, we lived together.
We went to med school together.

29:59.279 --> 30:00.079
Of course, I knew.

30:00.979 --> 30:03.979
I mean, it wasn't something
he bragged about.

30:05.479 --> 30:07.479
Although, I think
he took a lot of pride

30:11.179 --> 30:13.379
At least he said that he had.

30:18.079 --> 30:20.879
Gary mentioned
you guys met working

30:21.379 --> 30:23.879
Yeah. Lab tech work;

30:24.479 --> 30:27.079
like, petri dish cultures,
things like that.

30:27.579 --> 30:28.879
Do any work with lab rats?

30:30.079 --> 30:31.679
Sure, we did everything
with lab rats.

30:32.479 --> 30:33.979
You personally?

30:34.579 --> 30:36.079
Yeah, that's what
they paid us to do.

30:39.579 --> 30:42.479
something they want to put
in a food dye or something,

30:42.779 --> 30:43.979
and they want to see
if it's safe,

30:46.979 --> 30:50.379
and then you wait... 
and see if they die.

30:51.979 --> 30:53.779
we dissect them anyway;

30:54.779 --> 30:56.379
make sure they didn't have
anything wrong with them

30:57.179 --> 30:59.279
It was... it was a fun summer.

30:59.579 --> 31:01.179
Do you remember what chemical
you were testing?

31:03.279 --> 31:05.279
I remember
that it didn't kill the rats.

31:06.079 --> 31:07.879
Now what's all this about
anyway?

31:09.179 --> 31:11.979
We found a jar
with three dead rats in it

31:13.179 --> 31:15.579
Wow. That's weird.

31:18.279 --> 31:19.379
not that I know
what he's like.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.279
I just figured
they must have come from the lab

31:23.979 --> 31:25.979
I don't know.
I kind of doubt that.

31:26.579 --> 31:30.079
These are industrial clients,
big companies.

31:31.679 --> 31:33.379
all the rats
tagged and numbered.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.479
We have to document
everything we do

31:37.379 --> 31:39.879
I mean, it wasn't like you could
bring them home as pets or...

31:41.979 --> 31:42.979
I just figured it out.

31:45.179 --> 31:48.179
The, uh, the cop
that was his sponsor.

31:51.679 --> 31:53.179
He liked you.
He trusted you.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.579
I think he would have
wanted you to know that.

31:59.679 --> 32:00.479
Hi.

32:03.779 --> 32:05.079
Well, my husband
and I talked about it.

32:07.079 --> 32:08.879
So I want to bring
the application

32:09.379 --> 32:11.179
and our thousand-
dollar deposit.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.779
Fantastic.
Sit down.

32:15.079 --> 32:16.579
We put our house
up on the market,

32:18.079 --> 32:19.579
with the mortgage
broker tonight.

32:20.179 --> 32:23.579
Again, I want to emphasize that
for us, spd is of the essence.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.079
All right, then.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.579
It sounds serious.

32:28.879 --> 32:31.079
Let me dig out
our construction pgress list,

32:31.979 --> 32:34.079
see which houses are closest
to cometion,

32:39.879 --> 32:41.779
The Sheldons are closing
on a three-bedroom.

32:57.879 --> 33:00.679
My husband and I just
bought a t-bedroom

33:01.679 --> 33:04.079
Because this is a terrific
school district here.

33:10.779 --> 33:12.179
Mrs. Duboi are you all right?

33:13.879 --> 33:14.879
Can I get you something?

33:15.679 --> 33:16.679
Maybe a glass of water.

33:38.519 --> 33:39.319
Yeah?

33:41.419 --> 33:42.519
I don't know
if you're aware of it,

33:46.219 --> 33:47.419
I think you ought
to call your husband.

33:49.319 --> 33:52.219
Yeah, I will. I just needed
to be alone for a little bit.

33:52.919 --> 33:54.919
So now wouldn't be a good time
to ask you a question?

33:55.219 --> 33:58.319
Well, I probably just made
the biggest mistake of my life;

33:58.519 --> 34:00.419
put my husband
and my kids through hell,

34:00.919 --> 34:03.919
at the very least lost
a thousand-dollar deposit.

34:04.519 --> 34:05.819
Go ahead. Shoot.

34:07.419 --> 34:09.119
You ever heard
of chlorahydrofromaid?

34:09.719 --> 34:11.119
Why? You want to borrow some?

34:13.219 --> 34:15.418
Turns out Gary worked
as a lab tech last summer.

34:15.819 --> 34:19.719
He and David Channing were
involved in a toxicity study

34:20.119 --> 34:21.018
Okay.

34:21.219 --> 34:23.319
Apparently, it's some kind
of industrial byproduct.

34:25.119 --> 34:26.619
to demonstrate
that the stuff's harmless.

34:27.219 --> 34:28.319
Here's the weird part.

34:29.119 --> 34:30.619
The company that commissioned
the lab test

34:35.219 --> 34:36.819
Bunford Properties--
your developer.

34:37.219 --> 34:39.719
Apparently, they found
trace amounts of this

34:41.819 --> 34:42.918
Oh, my God.

34:45.119 --> 34:46.518
that Gary and his friend
David Channing conducted,

34:49.418 --> 34:51.219
Of course, nobody asked
the three dead rats

34:52.619 --> 34:53.819
They might feel differently.

34:57.219 --> 34:58.319
Of course.

34:59.219 --> 35:02.119
It was never our old house
that was going

35:03.019 --> 35:04.219
It's Willow Elm.

35:04.719 --> 35:06.419
Willow Elm is the answer.

35:06.819 --> 35:08.819
I was just asking
the wrong question.

35:10.619 --> 35:11.519
Mr. Bunford?

35:12.219 --> 35:13.019
Yes?

35:13.619 --> 35:15.519
Mr. Bunford,
my name is Manuel Devalos.

35:17.719 --> 35:19.919
This is Detective Lee Scanlon
with Phoenix PD.

35:22.219 --> 35:23.019
About?

35:23.619 --> 35:24.819
Chlorahydrofromaid.

35:25.619 --> 35:26.719
Well, what about it?

35:27.019 --> 35:27.919
It's old news.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.719
Apparently some small quantities
had seeped into the aquifer--

35:32.419 --> 35:33.619
the water supply.

35:35.119 --> 35:38.419
The quantities and the chemical
itself, for that matter,

35:39.119 --> 35:40.519
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

35:41.219 --> 35:42.419
Good Lord,
what is that?

35:42.919 --> 35:43.719
Rats.

35:44.419 --> 35:45.319
Yeah, I can see that.

35:48.519 --> 35:51.519
suffered from abnormally
low white blood cell counts.

35:51.719 --> 35:54.119
Their platelets
and red blood cells

35:55.719 --> 35:59.719
leukemia brought on
by exposure to massive doses

36:00.919 --> 36:02.019
Says you.

36:04.019 --> 36:05.719
Thanks for stopping by,
gentlemen.

36:06.219 --> 36:07.519
If you have
any further questions,

36:09.819 --> 36:11.419
Does the name Gary Albright
ring a bell?

36:14.619 --> 36:17.819
What part of "m not answering
your questions"

36:18.919 --> 36:21.019
Mr. Albright w found dead
in his apartment.

36:21.519 --> 36:23.519
We're investigating it
asossible homicide.

36:25.119 --> 36:26.519
that performed
the tests you ordere

36:26.919 --> 36:29.019
That jar was found
among his personal effects.

36:30.219 --> 36:31.019
Gentlemen...

36:34.319 --> 36:36.319
that your company ordered
onts water supply.

36:39.219 --> 36:43.119
came to you and told you
that chlahydrofromaid

36:47.019 --> 36:49.219
We're guessing you paid them
to get the results you wted,

36:51.319 --> 36:53.419
Honestly, I've never met
this Gary.

36:56.019 --> 36:58.919
Yeah. Well, we think
Gary had a change of heart.

36:59.319 --> 37:01.519
We think he decided
he couldn't live

37:02.119 --> 37:04.019
He decided to come forward

37:07.219 --> 37:10.619
Hey, folks, I'm just
finishing up a tour

37:12.019 --> 37:13.119
I'll be with you
in a minute.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.319
So what are you saying?
I killed this fellow?

37:21.219 --> 37:25.719
Gentlemen, if you have a problem
with the veracity

37:27.519 --> 37:30.519
I'm just a guy
who builds and sells houses.

37:30.619 --> 37:33.419
And really,
that's what I need to do.

37:38.519 --> 37:40.719
Thanks, man.
I'll see you next week.

37:42.619 --> 37:43.819
Hey, Channing,
what you doing?

37:51.019 --> 37:51.819
We need to talk.

37:53.619 --> 37:54.719
Sure, sure.

37:55.119 --> 37:57.019
I'm, I'm happy to talk.

37:58.319 --> 38:01.319
I don't know what
there really is to talk about.

38:04.019 --> 38:05.819
Just think of me
as a concerned f friend.

38:13.019 --> 38:13.819
You okay?

38:14.519 --> 38:15.719
Yeah, I am.
I'm fine.

38:17.719 --> 38:19.119
I though you looked
kind of anxious.

38:19.519 --> 38:21.719
Then, now you actually look
kind of sick, 

38:23.319 --> 38:24.519
you know?
You sick, Channing?

38:26.219 --> 38:27.019
No.

38:27.419 --> 38:28.519
Maybe you need
to get high.

38:29.719 --> 38:30.919
What are you
talking about?

38:31.119 --> 38:32.419
I don't think
it was the job

38:35.519 --> 38:37.519
I think it might have been
something else.

38:39.219 --> 38:41.519
No? You feel good?

38:42.919 --> 38:43.719
Great.

38:45.319 --> 38:46.319
Let's go down
to headquarters

38:47.819 --> 38:48.719
Whoa, Detective, wait.

38:49.519 --> 38:51.819
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?

38:52.919 --> 38:53.719
What are you doing?

38:54.619 --> 38:56.219
Assaulting a peace officer,
Channing?

38:56.619 --> 38:57.519
I barely touched you!

39:00.719 --> 39:02.219
You're jonesing harder
than I thought.

39:04.619 --> 39:07.319
You, you said...
you were here as a friend.

39:09.619 --> 39:10.519
I am...

39:11.319 --> 39:12.619
a friend of Gary's.

39:17.119 --> 39:18.219
Okay, okay.

39:19.519 --> 39:20.919
I have a problem.
I do,

39:21.819 --> 39:24.119
but I need, I need help,
Detective, you know?

39:27.919 --> 39:29.519
I want to get clean,
you know?

39:29.819 --> 39:30.719
I want to kick it...

39:32.219 --> 39:33.619
and I want to help you try...

39:33.819 --> 39:34.819
try to figure out

39:34.919 --> 39:37.919
whatever really happened
to Gary, I swear.

39:38.319 --> 39:39.819
You just...

39:42.019 --> 39:43.119
just unlock these cuffs.

39:46.619 --> 39:47.419
and then we can...

39:48.819 --> 39:50.919
you know, I can get right,
and then we can talk.

39:51.319 --> 39:52.519
That's good, Channing.

39:53.919 --> 39:55.319
You sound really sincere.

39:58.919 --> 40:01.019
No, I can't seem
to find that key.

40:01.819 --> 40:03.519
No, I guess I'll have to call
over to headquarters

40:06.419 --> 40:07.919
Looks like we could be here
for a while.

40:09.819 --> 40:10.919
You can't do that.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.019
How long can you
hold out, you know?

40:14.519 --> 40:15.819
????as you think.

40:16.819 --> 40:18.119
Look at you. You're a mess.

40:20.119 --> 40:20.919
Well...

40:22.819 --> 40:25.019
if I tell you
what you want to hear then...?

40:27.619 --> 40:29.019
Compassionate, even.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.719
After all,
I've been there myself.

40:38.319 --> 40:39.619
So why'd you kill him?

40:43.319 --> 40:45.519
Hmm? 'Cause he was calling me?

40:46.819 --> 40:48.119
'Cause he was starting
to realize

40:49.319 --> 40:50.219
wasn't going to make up for

40:51.019 --> 40:53.819
all the innocent people that
were going to get sick and die?

40:55.519 --> 40:56.619
All the children...

40:59.019 --> 41:00.619
Take your time.
I'm in no hurry.

41:06.419 --> 41:08.619
Girls, breakfast!

41:10.219 --> 41:11.219
All right,
listen to this.

41:11.819 --> 41:14.419
"Convicted developer
Albert Bunford faces

41:17.719 --> 41:18.519
Whoo!

41:19.619 --> 41:20.719
True confessions?

41:22.319 --> 41:23.319
I love this house,

41:24.519 --> 41:26.219
to get a little excited
about moving.

41:26.519 --> 41:27.519
Oh, really?

41:27.719 --> 41:30.119
Yeah, something about a bathroom
with two sinks,

41:30.319 --> 41:32.619
a community pool...

41:34.119 --> 41:36.219
Maybe in our next life, huh?

41:39.219 --> 41:41.419
You get an extra piece
of French tot.

41:42.819 --> 41:43.919
Girls!

41:46.119 --> 41:48.119
It looks like
a Frankenstein bear.

41:49.119 --> 41:51.519
I got some needle and thread
and stitched Mr. Snookie.

41:51.719 --> 41:54.019
JOE:
Look at that

41:55.019 --> 41:56.519
He does.

41:57.719 --> 41:59.119
(grunts)
Everything's good as new.
