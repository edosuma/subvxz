WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.502
Everybody down!

00:02.585 --> 00:05.005
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:06.923
-Police officer! Freeze!
-(gunshot)

00:08.717 --> 00:10.468
-Money in the bank.
-Why? What happened?

00:10.885 --> 00:11.761
Whiplash.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.722
-Let me hear some numbers.
-Six thousand.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.598
(scoffs) Do we take it?

00:15.682 --> 00:18.101
Six thousand within 24 hours
of the incident

00:18.184 --> 00:20.687
means they think they could be looking
at a $50,000 settlement.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.105
I'm growing a boil.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.690
Well, then let's go get it lanced.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.316
No. It's not ready yet.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.194
-Feeling lucky?
-(groans)

00:28.278 --> 00:31.156
I'm their only son,
and I can't afford to help them.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.617
Give me an order, Lieutenant.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.411
Kiss me, Nurse Wulfawitz.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.248
You're high, ain't you, Mizell?
Yeah, you're using.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.126
How'd you hurt your neck?
Banging your head against the wall

00:43.209 --> 00:45.003
in your nowhere job
in your nowhere precinct?

00:45.086 --> 00:45.920
Let him go, man.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.881
Still Mr. Personality, aren't you, Mizell?

00:47.964 --> 00:49.883
Still on the Hill, aren't you, Furillo?

00:49.966 --> 00:52.010
-That's enough.
-Seems to be for him.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.387
-Hey, Mizell.
-(grunts)

00:56.097 --> 00:58.141
-I'm ready!
-You're sick!

00:58.224 --> 01:01.019
Pull it! Let him go! Pull it!

01:02.353 --> 01:04.522
-(chattering)
-PHIL: Item eight.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.649
County marshals are evicting

01:06.733 --> 01:10.361
at 717 Woodruff Avenue
starting at 9:00 a.m.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.363
This is a 30-family edifice

01:12.447 --> 01:14.866
designated for immediate
and comprehensive urban renewal,

01:14.949 --> 01:16.326
i.e., the wrecking ball.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.744
Area patrols,

01:17.827 --> 01:21.998
let's be sure and, uh, check on passer-bys
for traffic congestion.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.584
Let's be aware that tenants
are at the risk of theft

01:24.667 --> 01:26.544
in the course of the moving process.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.255
And let's have Hill and Renko,

01:29.339 --> 01:33.093
Coffey and Bates keep a presence
outside the building.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.010
Let's.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.430
-Will you stop fidgeting, Bobby?
-PHIL: Item nine.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.975
The, uh, cadets of Group C
at the police academy

01:41.059 --> 01:43.353
have asked me to announce
the crowning of a--

01:43.728 --> 01:47.023
of a new champion... (chuckles)

01:47.107 --> 01:50.110
in the annual Eat Till You Barf contest.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.945
(laughing)

01:52.028 --> 01:55.698
Said individual consumed 14 pork chops,

01:55.782 --> 01:59.202
seven helpings of potato salad,
seven buttered rolls,

01:59.285 --> 02:03.206
and a half-quart jar
of Swedish dill pickles

02:04.374 --> 02:07.877
before succumbing
to the natural intestinal rejection.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.256
Now, this surpassed the, uh,
long-standing record

02:11.339 --> 02:15.552
formerly held by, uh, Cadet Lucille Bates.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.304
-(whooping)
-(applauding)

02:18.388 --> 02:22.517
Lucy, records are made to be broken.
Item 10.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.562
Congratulations and best wishes
for the future

02:25.645 --> 02:27.647
to our own Officer Tommy Geraci,

02:28.273 --> 02:32.485
who'll be tying the matrimonial knot
at noon, Saturday!

02:34.028 --> 02:37.073
In connection with the festivities tonight
at the Club Como, two announcements.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.784
Andy Sloan, who will be
officiating the party

02:40.034 --> 02:42.120
until the crap game begins,

02:42.662 --> 02:45.623
uh, cordially invites everyone
on the day shift,

02:45.707 --> 02:49.335
with the obvious exceptions,
who are asked, with sincere apologies,

02:49.419 --> 02:53.464
to understand the necessity
of male-only activity on such occasions.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.009
MAN: That's right. That's right.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.760
Also, a reminder from Captain Furillo

02:57.844 --> 03:00.054
that despite the physical removal
of the badge,

03:00.138 --> 03:02.307
with the advent of after-hour
civilian pursuits,

03:02.390 --> 03:07.020
it is still worn in spirit,
and that means keeping the party indoors

03:07.103 --> 03:09.397
and superficially civilized.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.482
(laughter)

03:11.900 --> 03:13.735
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.322
And let's be careful out there, huh?

03:25.330 --> 03:26.998
Oh, man, what kind of game
you trying to run now?

03:27.081 --> 03:28.708
Damn, I hate eviction duty.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.461
Try not to view the experience
with a jaundiced eye, Robert.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.047
It may go smooth, it may go routine.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.382
I'm gonna take my morning sit-down,

03:36.466 --> 03:40.595
then you and I will sally forth
to greet this beautiful day as a friend.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.641
Well, there goes someone
having regular sex, hmm?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.559
Yeah. Check this out.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.187
Oh, poopsie. Look.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.439
Eviction. Guy came after me with a hammer.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.524
Look, I'm collecting for Tommy's stag.

03:53.608 --> 03:57.278
We're asking 20 bucks for the booze,
the room and the entertainment.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.280
-That gonna cover the penicillin?
-Twenty bucks?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.867
We're also asking ten bucks
per man for Tommy's present.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.328
-What are you getting him?
-Ten bucks per man.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.705
-Oh, that's thoughtful.
-MAN: I am naked!

04:08.122 --> 04:12.043
I am buck naked! I'm naked! (laughing)

04:12.126 --> 04:16.256
I'm naked, I'm naked, I'm naked!
(shouting)

04:16.339 --> 04:20.426
-Got a name? Hey, you got a name?
-I am naked!

04:20.510 --> 04:23.346
I'm looking for Jesse Brochart.
Resisting and assault.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.473
Hiya, Miss Davenport. He's in holding.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.809
-Thank you.
-MAN: I'm naked, I'm naked!

04:27.892 --> 04:30.228
I'm buck naked!

04:30.311 --> 04:32.522
Buck Naked.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.774
-Buck naked.
-I don't wanna go to jail.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.443
-Buck naked.
-(yelling)

04:37.527 --> 04:38.903
(screams)

04:39.862 --> 04:43.199
(Joyce screaming)

04:44.200 --> 04:46.577
Back off! Back off or I'll break her neck!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.664
Back off! Nobody's taking me to jail.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.375
We're gonna hold court right here.
Back off!

04:52.834 --> 04:55.586
-Back off! Back off!
-(Joyce screams)

04:56.671 --> 04:58.965
(clamoring)

04:59.048 --> 04:59.882
MAN: Let me go!

05:00.633 --> 05:02.343
It's all right, Joyce.
You're gonna be all right.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.886
Leo, call an ambulance.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.558
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:09.767
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:09.851 --> 05:13.771
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:13.855 --> 05:15.398
(sirens wailing)

05:20.862 --> 05:24.782
(theme music playing)

06:48.324 --> 06:49.575
Belker.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.872
(humming)

07:03.297 --> 07:05.591
-Sit.
-Amen.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.264
(humming)

07:12.014 --> 07:14.142
-Name?
-Raoul.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.228
And Seymour did it to me.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.689
-(typewriter clacking)
-(laughing)

07:19.772 --> 07:21.566
It could've been the reds.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.861
It could've been the ludes.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.114
-Could--
-(phone rings)

07:28.823 --> 07:30.032
Belker.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.619
Hi, Ma. Ma?

07:34.662 --> 07:35.872
-Ma.
-(thuds)

07:36.914 --> 07:40.585
Ma, calm down!
I can't help if I can't understand.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.256
What do you mean you don't
have the strength? I wish the marines--

07:47.592 --> 07:48.926
He was hit by a car?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.471
Oh, God.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.389
Is he all right?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.020
You're sure it's just a broken finger?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.772
Never mind. Did he see Dr. Lehman?

08:02.773 --> 08:03.649
Good.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.902
What was he doing?

08:09.113 --> 08:12.074
Ma, how's somebody his age
gonna chase cars?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.495
Look, I'll come over tonight.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.914
We'll get this all straightened out,
all right?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.040
(man humming)

08:19.123 --> 08:21.125
All right. That's my girl.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.336
I'll see you tonight.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.464
Give my love to Pop.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.674
Goodbye.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.470
(humming)

08:35.723 --> 08:38.142
-(drawer opens)
-(rustles)

08:51.113 --> 08:54.075
Uh, Dr. Lehman, please.
This is Michael Belker calling.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.786
Hey, ask him
if he's got any Nembutal, man.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.995
Button it!

08:58.704 --> 09:01.249
Uh, would he be in later on?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.962
Do you think he could
make me one of his calls?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.630
I'm at the Hill Street Station.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.925
No, it isn't.
It's for a member of my family.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.971
No, that would be great. Whenever he can.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.932
Thank you very much.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.810
Doctor coming?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.728
(growling)

09:22.812 --> 09:24.897
(mutters, thuds)

09:28.359 --> 09:29.610
Hey, babe, what's the deal?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.656
-He'll be right with you, okay?
-LARUE: Thank you, sweet thing.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.827
Get the call on service, Maureen, and tell
the guy we're waiting on the parts.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.203
Good typist?

09:39.287 --> 09:41.205
Couldn't come in under
your own steam, huh, J.D.?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.833
-You gotta call in your pulling guard?
-LARUE: What do you mean?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.334
Come on.
I just got off the phone with her.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.044
Here, take the compact.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.921
Hey, hey, whoa. Wait a second.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.882
You telling me I can't call my own sister
to say hello?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.175
(sighs) There are the keys, J.D.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.011
Take the compact
and get the hell off the lot.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.221
Oh, that's a nice car, if you're a midget.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.140
-Come on, babe. Let's go.
-Wait a minute.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.474
This is how you treat
your own brother-in-law?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.059
You give him the bum's rush?

10:03.019 --> 10:04.145
Hey, look, man. Hey.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.523
I was kinda thinking
about that big baby over there.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.652
-That's the car I drive.
-Oh. You hear that, Neal?

10:12.653 --> 10:17.366
Look, Rob, you don't want
to sell me a car, so be it.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.078
What do you mean, sell?

10:23.748 --> 10:26.500
-Money in the bank.
-Why? What happened?

10:26.584 --> 10:29.545
I was rear-ended by an exec
from Timmons Textile.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.465
Double vision, whiplash.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.634
Lawyer says we're looking
at some serious numbers.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.803
-You got good coverage?
-Company car.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.722
Yeah, a couple of weeks,
I'll probably be rolling in it.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.349
Leastways, according to my lawyer.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.185
(sighs) I don't know.
What do you think, Neal?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.062
Maybe I should buy a compact.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.397
-They're cost-efficient--
-You'll get a few extra miles on 'em.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.484
But, uh, that baby out there, it, uh,

10:52.902 --> 10:53.986
runs like a dream.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.126
(man shouting)

11:09.752 --> 11:11.170
Hey, don't--

11:13.089 --> 11:14.632
-Hey, are you all right?
-Yeah.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.551
-That TV.
-What a shame.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.136
(chattering)

11:20.471 --> 11:24.600
You're a pool ball, and I'm a pool cue,
and I just do like this.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.229
MAN: Hey, he hit me!
The lousy jerk hit me!

11:28.312 --> 11:31.148
-How come he hit you?
-That guy upstairs, he's crazy.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.859
-Come on. I want him arrested, now.
-All right, all right.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.777
Come on.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.946
Mrs. Kramer, wait.
Wait a minute, Mrs. Kramer.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.281
You owe me $84.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.408
Just let them board the bus.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.118
So all of a sudden it means I got money?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.953
-Because I'm being evicted?
-Mrs. Kramer.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.623
I'll try and pay you the five dollars
a week like I always done.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.208
Just 'cause I'm moving
doesn't mean I became a crook.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.753
-Let her get on the bus.
-Don't treat me like a criminal.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.048
-I gave groceries for 20 years on credit.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.593
OLD MAN: You're sorry? My business--
What's gonna happen?

11:59.677 --> 12:02.430
-LUCY: I can't tell you--
-WOMAN: Oh, my God!

12:02.513 --> 12:05.599
It's ruined. What did they do?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.978
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He kinda dropped it before he got away.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.148
First my house, and now my TV.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.483
It's the only company I got.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.111
The hell with that, pal!
You're under arrest!

12:17.194 --> 12:19.196
Everybody calm down
till we get this worked out.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.614
There's nothing to work out!

12:20.698 --> 12:24.076
These are the last people on the floor,
and I gotta padlock this door!

12:24.160 --> 12:25.035
You're not doing anything

12:25.119 --> 12:26.704
until my grandmother gets good
and ready to leave.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.080
And I wanted this character arrested.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.250
ANDY: Y'all wanna be quiet, or y'all
wanna go downtown? Make a choice.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.921
Worchak, I understand your problem.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.590
But forget the arrest, okay?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.968
We got enough trouble as it is
without pushing for a riot.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
Mr. Grundy,
we've got our orders to follow,

12:47.266 --> 12:49.435
so if you could get your things
and move them downstairs.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.313
I am not going anywhere without her.
That's that.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.405
Mrs. Grundy, it seems
as though we have a--

13:01.489 --> 13:06.994
I don't believe a policeman's uniform's
ever been in this house before.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.039
I can believe that, ma'am.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.292
Don't you wanna come and go as a family?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.212
I couldn't stand the commotion.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.923
I couldn't stand getting used to it.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.594
My legs are gone.
They're just like rubber.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.846
And I can hardly see.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.184
No, I believe I'll stay right here.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.688
(sighs)

13:36.524 --> 13:38.275
Why don't you take
some of your things downstairs,

13:38.359 --> 13:41.237
and just have one of the young kids
come back and stay with her?

13:42.154 --> 13:44.073
-Come back later.
-Officer--

13:44.156 --> 13:47.326
Just do some of the other floors
and come back later.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.128
Seems like you still got
some raising to do.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.839
(chuckling)

13:59.922 --> 14:02.424
No, I raised Jerome's parents,

14:02.967 --> 14:04.468
and I raised Jerome.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.806
I believe I've done my portion.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.272
Step out for a second.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.361
Mrs. Grundy...

14:22.444 --> 14:23.654
(exhales)

14:24.196 --> 14:26.574
I'm terribly sorry about all of this,

14:26.657 --> 14:28.909
but I'm afraid you don't have any choice.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.328
If you don't go now on your own,

14:31.412 --> 14:33.497
then they're just gonna
come back and take you.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.457
That wouldn't be fitting.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.752
The Lord has his ways, baby.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.256
The Lord has his ways.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.384
Yes, he does.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.554
Yes, he does.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.726
Yes, he does.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.566
(humming)

15:09.825 --> 15:12.369
Michael, there's no point
in sugaring the pill.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.664
Your father had a senile episode
this morning.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.376
But he's been doing better, hasn't he?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.212
This was the first flare-up
in around a month.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.715
You've asked me for my opinion.
Let me give it to you.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.092
Your father's arteries have hardened.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.553
He's not getting enough blood
to his brain.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.222
-What?
-And his condition is not reversible.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.433
Overall, he's gonna get worse.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.936
What do you have, a crystal ball?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.730
Michael, how long have
I treated your family?

15:40.481 --> 15:42.566
Your father's had this condition
for 15 years.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.026
We medicated him.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.820
We had him on as much of a diet
as he would accept.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.364
Why hasn't anyone told me?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.199
Because there was nothing to say.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.326
He was leading a normal life.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.204
There is one thing
we have to say now, though, Michael.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.916
Your mother cannot give your father
the care that he's going to need.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.670
What about a nurse?

16:02.753 --> 16:05.673
Home nurses are $95 a shift.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.928
Would a nurse help?

16:11.553 --> 16:15.391
I know you love your parents, Michael,
but bankrupting yourself is not going--

16:15.933 --> 16:18.185
Thank you very much
for your time, Dr. Lehman.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.363
(knocks on door)

16:29.446 --> 16:31.991
-Yeah, Mick?
-How's Miss Davenport?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.535
Uh, they think she may
have a broken cheekbone.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.079
-I'm sorry.
-I'm grateful it wasn't worse.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.206
I heard you cleaned
that guy's clock for him.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.878
I need a couple of hours
personal time, Captain.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.046
Of course.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.552
Is everything all right, Mick?

16:53.929 --> 16:55.180
I gotta go to the bank.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.350
I gotta get a loan.
I gotta get a nurse for my father.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.812
-How old is he?
-Eghty-two.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.065
He needs help, and I can't...

17:07.943 --> 17:11.030
I'm their only son,
and I can't afford to help them.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.411
Mick.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.503
-Howard.
-Nurse Wulfawitz.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.880
How do you feel?

17:29.214 --> 17:32.134
Oh, pretty chipper over all.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.554
It seems a few
of my self-absorbing stitches, um,

17:35.929 --> 17:37.389
don't want to self-absorb.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.599
I see.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.440
You left these in your hospital room.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.324
My marine dog tags.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.076
I've been waiting to return them.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.996
-Waiting for you to call.
-Well, I meant them for a present.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.165
A token of a soldier's esteem.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.542
Why haven't you called me, Howard?

18:05.626 --> 18:06.585
(knocks)

18:08.253 --> 18:11.423
Well, what's this libel you're circulating
about my stitches?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.676
-How are you, doctor?
-Just fine.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.303
-Give me some light, nurse.
-Okay.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.931
Are... Are you gonna take them out now?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.433
Aren't you gonna use some anesthetic or--

18:21.850 --> 18:24.978
Oh, I would like to get a picture of this
for their representative.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.940
One hundred percent
self-absorption, my foot.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.067
(whistling)

18:35.864 --> 18:36.782
(snips)

18:37.783 --> 18:39.034
There you go, Lieutenant.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.662
You can still dance
in the Roxy chorus line.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.664
-That won't scar much at all.
-(taps)

18:43.747 --> 18:45.207
Thanks ever so much.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.085
(curtain pull closes)

18:51.296 --> 18:53.549
(sighs)

18:55.884 --> 18:56.885
WULFAWITZ: Howard!

18:56.969 --> 19:00.347
Don't you put your pants on.
We were discussing phone calls.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.224
Well, I thought, uh...

19:03.684 --> 19:07.104
I guess it was just plain fear. I--

19:08.063 --> 19:11.108
I tried to dial the number so many times.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.527
Oh, and I willed that phone to ring.

19:14.069 --> 19:14.903
Well--

19:15.195 --> 19:18.031
-Do you want us to see each other?
-I do.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.993
I am such a fumble-tongue!

19:21.410 --> 19:24.079
You know, I'm very articulate in command.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.919
Give me an order, Lieutenant.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.797
Kiss me, Nurse Wulfawitz.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.340
Howard.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.190
Mm. Mm.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.195
Oh!

19:56.862 --> 19:59.489
I want you to meet my parents.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.995
(police siren wailing)

20:05.454 --> 20:07.789
MAN: Coming through. Excuse us.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.713
(horn honking)

20:21.011 --> 20:22.512
MAN: Just keep away.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.932
I mean it, sonny!

20:25.015 --> 20:26.600
-Please, Mr. Seligman.
-Don't, Mr. Seligman.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.062
HENRY: I just want you
to be able to hear me.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.774
Come with your boss,
I'll be able to hear perfectly.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.569
I promise you,
my boss said I could speak for him.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.030
So, I'm listening. Speak.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.032
We're in close touch
with the Housing Authority.

20:42.115 --> 20:45.035
They're trying to address
the situation right now.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.246
Housing Authority, phooey.

20:47.913 --> 20:53.377
For five months, all I get from them,
they're gonna move us to the Hotel Crane.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.004
You know the Hotel Crane?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.174
I took a bus last week. I saw it.

20:59.883 --> 21:03.553
The people who break in
and beat up live there.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.181
What's the point I move?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.684
I should wait for the night
they beat me up?

21:09.476 --> 21:12.604
-I'd rather jump.
-It's only temporary, Mr. Seligman.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.856
Don't talk to me temporary.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.902
I want to see a picture of building
I can live in like a mensch.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.196
I want to see a lease.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.241
That's all I got to say.

21:25.367 --> 21:29.621
-We get you a bowl of soup?
-Get me a safe place to live.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.540
(man shouting)

21:32.374 --> 21:34.001
-Hey!
-The boys!

21:34.084 --> 21:36.295
-The man, huh?
-Please, watch your language.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.462
(laughs)

21:37.546 --> 21:39.339
-Come on. Sit. Relax.
-All right, all right.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.883
-You want some wine? Grab a glass.
-All right, all right.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.345
-I'm into wine now.
-What kind of wine is this?

21:45.429 --> 21:48.932
-What is this?
-This? A little insurance grift.

21:49.016 --> 21:52.602
Huh! That's beautiful.
And what's good with you, boychick?

21:52.686 --> 21:55.439
You are, Sid, baby. (sniffs) You are.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.357
(sniffs) Okay.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.986
-You boys ready to gain some weight?
-Hey, always.

22:01.528 --> 22:05.324
Okay, I think I can put you in touch
with that chef tonight.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.410
You hear that? Oh, way to go, Sidney.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.246
-Now, I've reserved five pounds--
-Hey, whoa, whoa.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.999
-We can't get that fat.
-Oh, that's right.

22:14.082 --> 22:17.836
-You were talking about a deuce, right?
-That's our max, baby.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.380
Okay, that's so.
I think I can piece the rest out.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.549
I just wanted to give
you boys the shot, huh?

22:22.632 --> 22:24.676
What a guy, huh? We appreciate that.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.763
That's okay. I think we're gonna be doing
a lot of business together.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.932
I mean, this one particular guy,
he's a one-shot,

22:31.016 --> 22:33.810
but, I mean, I'm very well connected
with their nationality.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.938
-Uh-huh!
-Sid, how ya doing?

22:37.022 --> 22:39.274
Hey, uh, look who's here.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.317
You're early, huh?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.735
-How you making it?
-I'm doing fine.

22:41.818 --> 22:45.697
I'm just talking with a couple friends.
Give me a couple minutes, okay? Okay.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.532
(indistinct)

22:48.158 --> 22:50.452
-Why don't your friends meet your friends?
-What?

22:50.535 --> 22:52.871
Hey, maybe they don't want to meet you.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.248
We already know each other.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.627
Oh, is that right?
You know this character?

22:59.086 --> 23:01.546
-Yeah.
-We're in the same racket.

23:02.422 --> 23:05.008
Hey, it's a big world. A lot of noses.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.802
What's he calling himself?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.930
Hey, I don't care
if he calls himself Shirley Temple.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.725
No, no, no, no. I just--
You know what I'm gonna do?

23:14.267 --> 23:16.103
I'll call them Garbage and Cans.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.980
Hey, Ace, let's you and me
go into the john.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.233
That's right.
That's where you got your start, isn't it?

23:21.316 --> 23:23.151
-Come on.
-SID: Come on, guys.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.070
We're all adults. Let's not.

23:27.989 --> 23:31.243
You don't change, do you, Mizell?
You're still 100 percent tube steak.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.869
-He's my action.
-The hell he is.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.204
We've been working him three weeks.

23:34.287 --> 23:37.290
I don't care if you're working him
three years. He's Narcotics. He's mine.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.959
You beat it!

23:39.626 --> 23:41.753
Where do you get the stones telling him
we know each other?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.713
Oh, you're such a deep thinker, LaRue.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.425
What, did I blow your cover
'cause one dealer knows another?

23:47.342 --> 23:48.844
People say you screwed
your career behind booze,

23:48.927 --> 23:50.137
but I think you're stupid.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.888
Come on. You swing on me.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.849
Because I'll rip your arm off
and put it down your throat.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.560
You're high, ain't you, Mizell?
Yeah, you're using.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.354
How'd you hurt your neck, LaRue?
Banging your head against the wall

23:59.438 --> 24:01.314
in your nowhere job
in your nowhere precinct?

24:01.398 --> 24:02.232
Let him go, man!

24:02.315 --> 24:04.359
Hey, 86. Nobody needs this.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.819
Teddy, Steve.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.364
SID: I'll start making my appointments
in separate restaurants.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.204
-Kook.
-Yeah.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.331
Where have you been
all your life, detective?

24:19.082 --> 24:21.960
-Excuse me?
-You haven't generated a credit record.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.837
You seem to have been an underground man.

24:25.922 --> 24:29.926
-I got my car there, my utilities.
-No credit cards.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.013
I always paid cash.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.806
I know it's a paradox,

24:34.890 --> 24:38.226
but your not having borrowed before
makes you a poor candidate for a loan.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.480
-Uh-huh.
-The other problem, of course, is salary.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.773
For a $10,000 loan, unsecured,

24:43.857 --> 24:46.318
we'd like to see you bring in
about half again your present income.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.069
(laughs) So would I.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.865
I'm afraid the credit history alone
gets you a no.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.077
Well, it doesn't make me happy
to say that, detective.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.873
You have an excellent reason for the loan,
and my guess is you're a decent risk.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.084
If you can find a cosignator,
come back and see me.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.879
Would you give me some idea
where else I might apply?

25:05.962 --> 25:09.382
Loan companies are your obvious bet,
but they like you to have some property.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.884
I got a car.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.803
It's 12 years old. You really haven't--

25:15.430 --> 25:18.266
-Oh, my God!
-MICK: What is it, a stickup?

25:19.976 --> 25:22.312
Try to stay calm and don't move.

25:23.939 --> 25:24.814
Is it called in?

25:26.066 --> 25:27.108
It's automatic.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.946
-I have a heart condition.
-Everything's gonna be fine.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.284
I want you to tell me
when they leave the teller.

25:36.743 --> 25:37.619
All right.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.664
MICK: There's gonna be cars outside
in about 30 more seconds.

25:42.832 --> 25:43.959
Oh, my God!

25:44.543 --> 25:46.294
Who's your favorite baseball team?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.090
The St. Louis Cardinals.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.175
Who is your favorite player?

25:52.717 --> 25:55.720
Stan the Man. There they go.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.846
Get down.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.894
-Oh!
-Everybody down!

26:02.978 --> 26:05.855
-(tires screeching)
-(gunfire)

26:09.234 --> 26:11.069
-Police officer! Freeze!
-(gunshot)

26:12.779 --> 26:14.489
-(gunshot)
-(woman sobbing)

26:17.993 --> 26:20.704
(police siren wailing)

26:28.503 --> 26:30.046
You know the drill, detective.

26:36.970 --> 26:40.307
Stick close to your desk.
Looks to me like about 24 hours.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.522
I want to thank you, detective.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.736
I'd like to know
a little more about this loan.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.782
So you can tell me I'm a jerk,
I'm an underground man?

26:58.241 --> 27:00.327
I want to know if you're being realistic.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.911
Is it just the start
of what you'll be spending

27:01.995 --> 27:05.332
-for your father's medical care, or--
-I want to get him a nurse.

27:05.832 --> 27:09.377
The application says what it's for.
It's for 100 days.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.795
Is he terminal?

27:10.879 --> 27:13.006
-Is he not expected--
-He's my father!

27:16.509 --> 27:17.385
Look...

27:18.720 --> 27:20.972
I'm gonna cosign this note for you.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.140
Why?

27:22.766 --> 27:27.270
'Cause I pulled a gun and killed somebody
to save your lousy bank a couple grand?

27:27.354 --> 27:29.731
You're an honorable man, Officer Belker.

27:29.814 --> 27:33.360
We put that under
"additional information" in the file.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.154
-When can I get the check?
-Stop by in the morning?

27:37.739 --> 27:38.615
Thank you.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.911
Frank, you got any juice
at Housing Authority?

27:42.994 --> 27:44.871
Ah, not so you'd notice.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.332
My jumper wants you to bring him
a picture of someplace

27:47.415 --> 27:50.418
he knows is safe and a signed lease
for an apartment there.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.795
He doesn't trust anybody at Housing.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.464
-Where do they wanna place him?
-The Hotel Crane.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.633
I mean, my guy's the only guy on a ledge.

27:56.716 --> 28:00.178
<i>But 18 out of 30 apartments,</i>
<i>they were people with Social Security.</i>

28:00.261 --> 28:02.639
Put them in a zoo like the Crane,
they might as well go off a roof.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.140
Henry, you trying to get this guy down,

28:04.224 --> 28:06.226
or are you acting
as his real estate broker?

28:06.309 --> 28:08.520
I'm trying to give you a sense
of his frame of mind.

28:08.603 --> 28:11.231
He doesn't feel he has anything to lose.
He's gonna jump.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.316
All right. I'll get back to you.

28:13.983 --> 28:14.984
(phone thuds)

28:17.654 --> 28:20.699
Ray, would you get me
the Housing Authority, please?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.162
I'm telling you at the start, Jerry,

28:26.246 --> 28:30.041
I will not have my men or their cover
jeopardized by territorial jealousies.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.293
That's not how I heard the story, Frank.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.380
Mizell says he's made
the best of a bad situation.

28:35.463 --> 28:38.800
Everyone had seen everyone else.
It was obvious they all knew each other.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.344
The most dangerous thing
would've been for him to play dumb.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.847
He's lying, Captain.
He had plenty of room to walk.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.640
We're just gonna go around
and around with this.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.100
Can we just tell them to get lost?

28:47.183 --> 28:49.060
Still Mr. Personality, aren't you, Mizell?

28:49.144 --> 28:51.104
Still on the Hill, aren't you, Furrilo?

28:51.187 --> 28:53.273
-That's enough.
-Seems to be for him.

28:53.356 --> 28:54.858
Shut your mouth, Mizell!

28:55.525 --> 28:57.110
Let's make some decisions here.

28:57.485 --> 29:01.489
You guys aren't looking to get married.
All you have to do is work together.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.325
I think in terms of budget for the buy
and everything else,

29:04.409 --> 29:06.369
it would make sense
if we went joint venture.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.621
-Is that livable?
-How does the bust go?

29:08.705 --> 29:10.957
-Whoever makes it.
-No dice, Mizell.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.835
The bust is coordinated
and made in concert, understood?

29:13.918 --> 29:15.837
(scoffs)

29:16.212 --> 29:17.255
Turn around.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.425
Is that understood?

29:21.259 --> 29:23.511
You're a hell of an impressive guy,
Furillo.

29:24.179 --> 29:27.682
-Do you do that for the mirror at night?
-Get outta here.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.448
-I'm sorry, Frank.
-That's not nearly good enough, Jerry.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.909
-What's going on?
-Hey, come on!

29:45.992 --> 29:48.912
You had him.
You know, he's always been a bad egg.

29:49.412 --> 29:52.040
-He's also my best cop.
-He's also out of control.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.083
Look, he's under a lot of pressure.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.169
He's on top of some
very heavy stuff right now.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.046
I mean, that guy this afternoon?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.590
Mizell says he's part of a whole thing
at the airport.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.927
And your guys fall into him because
LaRue's got the same bookmaker.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.428
You're not addressing the problem.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.973
And you're not realizing what it's like
to go 18 months under!

30:09.349 --> 30:12.602
You live with crazies, Frank!
You get a little crazy!

30:12.685 --> 30:14.020
Not like this.

30:15.271 --> 30:17.440
Ten days. Two weeks.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.150
I'll be able to bring him in.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.779
I mean, this here, this'll work out fine
for everybody. You'll see.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.447
Your guys'll be able to sit on him.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.705
-Bring him in, Jerry.
-Two weeks, tops.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.001
-Neal, J.D.
-Uh, Detective.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.545
Oh, two minutes.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.010
Uh...

30:46.970 --> 30:49.347
-Mrs. Furillo?
-Attorney Wachtel.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.891
-Oh, Alan, please.
-Alan.

30:51.975 --> 30:55.436
Well, how are you?
I'm delighted to see you again.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.690
I'm fine, thank you.
Just waiting to see my husband.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.734
Oh. Have you reconciled?

31:02.527 --> 31:05.947
No. I guess I just call him
that out of habit.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.450
Uh-huh. Has there actually been a divorce?

31:09.534 --> 31:12.495
-Afraid so. Four years ago.
-Uh-huh.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.997
Uh-huh.

31:14.581 --> 31:18.209
And, uh, if you don't mind
too intrusive an inquiry,

31:18.293 --> 31:19.419
what's your alimony, Fay?

31:19.502 --> 31:20.587
-My alimony?
-Yeah.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.714
I mean, are you satisfied
with the settlement?

31:22.964 --> 31:25.508
They're never engraved in brass,
you know. (chuckles)

31:25.592 --> 31:28.428
Oh, listen to me.
Business, business, business.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.054
What I really wanted to know is

31:30.138 --> 31:32.390
whether I could take you out
to dinner some night?

31:33.641 --> 31:35.602
-I don't know.
-Well, think about it.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.228
But think about both things.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.189
Hey, Al. How's it going?

31:40.273 --> 31:43.484
Frank, I have the Housing Commissioner.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.528
-How long will this--
-Just a few minutes, really.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.447
I have the most important thing
to tell you.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.573
Wait in my office.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.199
What do you know?

31:50.283 --> 31:52.327
We just got an offer
from Timmons's insurers.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.954
-Yeah? Let me hear some numbers.
-Six thousand.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.040
-Hoo.
-You feel light-headed?

31:59.626 --> 32:01.961
-Do we take it?
-Are you kidding?

32:02.545 --> 32:04.756
Six thousand within 24 hours
of the incident

32:04.839 --> 32:07.467
means they think they could be looking
at a $50,000 settlement.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.552
A hundred if it goes to trial.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.846
-For a stiff neck?
-Shh. Keep your voice down.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.265
You don't know
who's stringing in a place like this.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.100
(chattering)

32:17.143 --> 32:18.603
Let me tell you something, John.

32:19.395 --> 32:22.315
When you had the presence of mind
to faint after that accident,

32:22.398 --> 32:26.027
you opened up the whole spectrum
of neurological possibility.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.279
I mean, they don't know
whether they're looking at

32:28.363 --> 32:30.698
spinal damage, cranial trauma.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.367
Believe me, I could drop a dime
this minute.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.410
I can get you a check for $15,000.

32:34.494 --> 32:35.828
Hoo.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.706
You're gonna have to babysit me, Al.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.750
When a guy's been tap city
as long as I have--

32:40.833 --> 32:43.002
I understand. I understand completely.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.964
Now, you just keep visiting
that neurologist.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.675
You leave the talking
to Timmons's people with me, huh?

32:50.009 --> 32:51.511
-John?
-Huh?

32:52.178 --> 32:54.973
-You see this guy here?
-Oh, yeah.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.849
-Got hit by a cab.
-Ah.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.394
Well, you know, technically, I, uh, can't.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.687
But, uh...

33:03.690 --> 33:05.608
will you let him know
that I'm an attorney?

33:09.696 --> 33:11.698
But if those units are vacant,
Commissioner--

33:12.240 --> 33:14.325
I understand
they're in the federal purview.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.035
Henry on two.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.413
Commissioner, you mean to tell me

33:18.496 --> 33:21.541
that with a man about to take
his own life, you're not prepared to--

33:21.791 --> 33:23.751
The housing he was offered wasn't safe.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.838
That's right.
We'd be giving into blackmail.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.298
You're a man of great imagination,
Commissioner.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.134
It's been a pleasure talking with you.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.264
-Yeah, Henry?
-You'd better get down here, Frank.

33:36.597 --> 33:40.435
Henry, I have nothing to give the man.
I'm batting zero.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.520
I've gotta be able
to tell him you're coming.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.147
(sighs) All right.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.607
I'm afraid we're gonna
lose this guy, Frank.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.026
Just tell him I'm on my way.

33:51.612 --> 33:54.240
Uh, Fay, we have a guy
up on a tenement roof,

33:54.323 --> 33:55.241
and I have to be down there.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.036
-I've got some very exciting news, Frank.
-What?

33:58.119 --> 33:59.412
You remember that interview
I had with Jon Gennaro?

33:59.495 --> 34:00.329
Yeah.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.081
-The one that you arranged for me?
-I remember.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.042
-It sold.
-That's great.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.461
-Guess for how much?
-Fay, I can't imagine.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.130
-Come on. Guess.
-Fay. $500.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.132
-Add a zero, mister.
-Really?

34:11.215 --> 34:14.135
(giggles) Five big ones, Frank.
Can you believe it?

34:14.218 --> 34:17.138
I mean, I must've spent it
ten different ways on the way over here.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.307
What do you think, springtime in Paris?

34:19.390 --> 34:20.892
-Maybe a new car?
-A new car?

34:20.975 --> 34:24.395
Well, I'm just fantasizing.
But, I mean, it's so wonderful!

34:24.479 --> 34:27.231
I wouldn't go out buying a new car.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.152
-What?
-Uh, never mind.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.197
-We'll talk about it tomorrow.
-Talk about what?

34:34.280 --> 34:37.408
-Forget it. Just congratulations.
-Forget what?

34:37.492 --> 34:41.579
The 1,900 I loaned you last year
when you front-ended your current car.

34:41.662 --> 34:42.914
What about it?

34:42.997 --> 34:45.500
Well, I just thought
before you go out on a buying spree--

34:45.583 --> 34:49.128
I don't believe you're bringing that up
now at this time.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.005
I was skipping it. You insisted.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.799
Who knew you were gonna slap a lien on me?

34:52.882 --> 34:54.509
I'm not slapping a lien on you.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.554
This is my day of triumph!
I'm getting national publication!

34:58.971 --> 35:01.057
Forget it. I'm sorry I said it.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.351
I really couldn't be happier for you.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.352
Sure.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.313
I can understand why.

35:07.730 --> 35:08.648
Fay.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.567
I can pay my own way, mister!

35:12.276 --> 35:14.070
I got money in the bank!

35:14.737 --> 35:17.240
-(police siren wailing)
-MAN: Stand back. Stand back.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.493
(man speaking Spanish)

35:20.576 --> 35:22.286
Jump! Jump!

35:25.164 --> 35:26.290
To the right, Captain.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.544
HENRY: You want anything in the meantime,
you just say so.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.712
(door opens, closes)

35:34.590 --> 35:37.468
-There he is.
-You're Henry's boss?

35:38.803 --> 35:39.929
Yes, I am.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.598
Why don't you listen to him
and come on down?

35:42.682 --> 35:45.643
This is his news he's bringing?

35:45.726 --> 35:48.479
No, it isn't, Mr. Seligman. It isn't.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.315
We may have something
in the works for you, Mr. Seligman.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.235
(chattering)

35:55.570 --> 35:58.990
Hey! Hey, you with that car!
Get that car outta here!

35:59.073 --> 36:02.243
Let's go. Move the car. Councilman.

36:02.910 --> 36:06.372
Well, Officer Hill,
I see you've got everything under control.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.540
How's our jumper?

36:08.457 --> 36:09.542
He hasn't jumped.

36:10.585 --> 36:14.005
Now I'll show you what
a good councilman can do. Excuse me.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.805
Why don't you let me help you down,
Mr. Seligman, so we can talk?

36:22.889 --> 36:26.267
I can talk fine from here, thanks.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.770
I don't come down without what I said.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.857
Excuse me, please.
I think I can help on that.

36:33.816 --> 36:37.778
-I'm your councilman, Mr. Seligman.
-(speaks foreign language)

36:37.862 --> 36:38.696
What did he say?

36:38.779 --> 36:41.490
This is Councilman Detweiler,
Mr. Seligman.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.203
I think we have an arrangement
for you, old-timer,

36:45.286 --> 36:47.788
if we can all get off this roof.

36:48.748 --> 36:52.293
Now, the, uh,
the radio people said that you--

36:54.503 --> 36:57.381
that, uh, you, uh, wanted to see
a photograph.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.012
Careful.

37:07.016 --> 37:11.145
-This is?
-144 Dekker, the Heights.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.148
Some citizens,
they couldn't keep up with the taxes.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.525
Mr. Seligman, it's about
as safe a neighborhood

37:16.609 --> 37:18.277
as you're gonna find in this city.

37:18.778 --> 37:22.198
I oughta know. We're gonna be
the next thing to neighbors.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.658
What about the lease?

37:24.659 --> 37:26.118
A solid year.

37:34.877 --> 37:35.962
What about the others?

37:37.088 --> 37:40.007
It's a 14-unit dwelling, my friend.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.388
I accept.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.565
(soft chattering)

38:02.947 --> 38:05.783
Not bad for a drunk, eh, Furillo?

38:11.998 --> 38:14.250
What I like to think
we proved today is not

38:14.333 --> 38:16.752
that Arnold Detweiler
takes care of his constituents.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.089
I hope by now
that isn't something that needs proving.

38:20.464 --> 38:24.176
I think we've proved
that institutions can and do work

38:24.260 --> 38:27.847
if the people in authority
help bring them alive,

38:27.930 --> 38:32.310
if only they help make them responsive
to the needs of the people.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.812
-Councilman, what about--
-No, no, no. I'm sorry, Gary.

38:34.895 --> 38:38.107
I've gotta get home to dinner.
My missus is gonna kill me.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.152
-Excuse me.
-(chattering)

38:42.445 --> 38:44.530
Well, Officer Hill, keep up the good work.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.618
You'd better get up to 403.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.623
Apparently a place was secured.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.378
(woman sobbing)

39:24.862 --> 39:28.449
It's... It's like she just decided to die.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.669
(chattering)

39:41.545 --> 39:43.381
-How you feel, Tommy?
-Not as good as I'm gonna.

39:43.464 --> 39:44.548
You guys are coming, aren't you?

39:44.632 --> 39:47.051
-Wouldn't miss it for the world.
-We'll see you there.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.596
I swear, Robert.
I hate to lose a night from my rotation.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.973
Just think of those two poor women--

39:53.057 --> 39:56.352
Cheryl and Teresa,
both deprived of my charms.

39:56.435 --> 40:00.231
You know, Renko, sometimes you're funny,
and sometimes you're just a fool.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.817
Now, Bobby Hill,
you're off your feed tonight,

40:02.900 --> 40:04.693
and I would like to know the reason why.

40:05.694 --> 40:08.114
I closed that old lady's
eyes today, Renko.

40:09.031 --> 40:12.493
And I'm also having
a lot of pain in my butt.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.120
(locker door closes)

40:16.038 --> 40:18.582
Are we talking, uh, hemmies?

40:19.125 --> 40:22.837
No, it's on the outside.
I think I'm growing a boil.

40:23.337 --> 40:26.257
-Well, then, let's go get it lanced.
-No, it's not ready yet.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.134
You know, I had one of
these things six years ago.

40:28.217 --> 40:31.053
There was one day I was
afraid I wasn't gonna die.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.265
-Feeling lucky?
-(groans)

40:36.267 --> 40:37.810
(upbeat music playing)

40:37.893 --> 40:40.938
-Man, where you been?
-Hey!

40:41.397 --> 40:44.275
I got you something important.
You gonna love this.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.651
You gonna love this!

40:47.778 --> 40:50.781
Tommy. Tommy.
Someone I'd like you to meet--

40:50.865 --> 40:52.491
-What'd you say your name was again?
-Arlene.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.201
Arlene and Ginger.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.959
-So, how are you doing?
-(laughs)

41:02.042 --> 41:03.586
Things are gonna be fine.

41:04.795 --> 41:08.340
-So, you're the man of the hour, huh?
-I'm more like around 90 seconds.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.384
Oh, honey, don't you worry about that.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.761
MAN: That's right.
Don't you worry about that.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.890
-Ginger, you gotta promise me one thing.
-What's that?

41:16.390 --> 41:18.767
You won't fall in love with me,
because I'll just break your heart.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.603
-Oh.
-I'll be next.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.648
(clamoring)

41:24.732 --> 41:26.734
I got-- I got--

41:26.817 --> 41:28.861
I got $30 right there.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.412
Seven coming up.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.165
(cheering)

41:41.248 --> 41:43.125
All right! I'll tell you.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.336
I'm with you boys in spirit.
That's for sure.

41:45.419 --> 41:48.130
Wait. Give me some of that spread.
There we go.

41:49.256 --> 41:51.592
<i>♪ I bet I do, bet I don't ♪</i>

41:51.675 --> 41:53.469
<i>♪ Don't drink liquor</i>
<i>Don't snort toot ♪</i>

41:53.552 --> 41:54.970
<i>♪ Come on, baby</i>
<i>Shoot, shoot, shoot ♪</i>

41:55.054 --> 41:58.432
(all laughing)

41:58.516 --> 42:00.226
-Betting 40. Betting 40.
-Put your money up.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.645
You gonna play? You just can't sit there.

42:02.728 --> 42:05.689
If you're gonna sit there,
get on and sit somewhere else.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.359
Hey, man, you ain't said--
you're faded, brother.

42:08.442 --> 42:12.655
-A yard says the man can't.
-Bet I will, bet I won't. I got you!

42:12.738 --> 42:15.533
-Yeah!
-(laughs)

42:15.616 --> 42:17.159
Some of that belongs to me.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.248
-New shooter. New shooter.
-I ain't do too bad.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.042
Give me the dice. Give me your dice.
Who's got the dice?

42:25.251 --> 42:26.544
Right in the front. All right.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.420
New shooter coming up.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.381
Got 200. Yes!

42:35.928 --> 42:39.348
-I got two Franklins here says I can.
-Hey, easy, my man, easy.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.809
-LARUE: No sweat.
-That must be a strange feeling.

42:41.892 --> 42:45.604
Oh, yeah. You want
the Mr. Nowhere Contest, right, Mizell?

42:45.688 --> 42:46.564
It's down the hall.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.816
What are you, LaRue,
a few bucks ahead here, huh?

42:49.358 --> 42:51.360
I'm gonna have to sit down
till you blow all of that.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.363
When's the last time you left a game
with money in your pocket?

42:54.446 --> 42:56.156
When there was a raid? (laughs)

42:56.240 --> 42:57.908
I can walk whenever I want.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.369
And I bet you don't need a drink either,
do you, LaRue?

43:00.452 --> 43:02.079
Because, I mean, you do that for pleasure.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.539
What's the matter with you, Mizell?

43:03.622 --> 43:05.958
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the soul shaker.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.751
I'm sorry. I lost you in the lights, boy.

43:07.835 --> 43:11.046
Must've been a real good shipment, sucker.
Got you wired nice and tight.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.715
No, no, no, no. Back off, Neal.

43:12.798 --> 43:15.593
Hey, Mizell, why don't you
teach me some kung fu?

43:15.676 --> 43:17.052
(grunts)

43:18.053 --> 43:19.555
-Come on, guys!
-Mizell!

43:23.142 --> 43:26.353
-Let me go! Let me go!
-You like that?

43:26.437 --> 43:29.106
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Get outta here!

43:29.898 --> 43:31.650
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

43:31.734 --> 43:33.611
-Boy, get out.
-Break it up.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.863
It's over. It's over. Now, let's go back.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.448
Hopped-up, junko narc.

43:37.531 --> 43:39.783
He can't even find the door. I'd like to--

43:39.867 --> 43:42.286
It's over with, man.
Let's just party, all right?

43:42.369 --> 43:44.121
-Everybody party.
-Come on. It's over.

43:44.204 --> 43:47.625
J.D., this fool's taking a damn crowbar
to your car, man.

43:48.542 --> 43:49.460
Don't everybody go out there!

43:49.543 --> 43:52.379
(clamoring)

43:53.380 --> 43:54.840
LARUE: Mizell!

43:56.008 --> 43:57.092
Mizell!

43:57.176 --> 44:00.220
-Come on. This way.
-Mizell!

44:03.474 --> 44:05.934
No, man! Don't!

44:06.018 --> 44:09.438
-MAN: Stop him!
-LARUE: Do something!

44:09.521 --> 44:12.107
Mizell! Look, you better stop it, man!

44:12.191 --> 44:15.402
Mizell, I gonna kill you, man!
It's my brother-in-law's car.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.571
All right. All right. Hey. Hey.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.574
Mizell, look at this! Watch me!

44:21.283 --> 44:23.327
Watch me! Mizell!

44:25.371 --> 44:28.165
(men shouting)

44:31.001 --> 44:32.503
All right! What do you think?

44:32.586 --> 44:34.380
(shouting continues)

44:34.463 --> 44:37.216
-Come on! Let's do it!
-Wait, wait, wait!

44:39.551 --> 44:42.388
-Come on! Let's go!
-I'm ready!

44:42.471 --> 44:44.973
Stop it! Be cool, baby! Stop it. Stop it.

44:45.057 --> 44:47.851
-Pull it! Let him go! Pull it!
-Relax.

44:47.935 --> 44:51.271
-You need help, man. You're sick.
-Hush up, J.D.!

44:51.355 --> 44:52.773
Hush up, man. Come on.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.442
LARUE: Look at you, you junkie!

44:56.276 --> 44:57.945
Put it down, Stanley.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.870
Put it down, Stanley.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.718
I can buy two more
of those tomorrow, you know.

45:22.177 --> 45:25.264
-Let it go. Let it go, man!
-You're sick, Danny. Sick!

45:27.015 --> 45:30.394
You go near Sid and I'll kill you!

45:34.314 --> 45:35.315
I'll kill you.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.360
(laughs)

45:44.450 --> 45:45.909
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

45:57.045 --> 45:58.172
(door closes)

46:05.888 --> 46:07.473
-Hi.
-Hi.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.143
-How you feeling?
-All right.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.396
-I ache.
-Mm-hmm.

46:18.233 --> 46:19.276
This, uh,

46:21.361 --> 46:22.946
it isn't broken, Frank.

46:23.322 --> 46:24.490
That's wonderful.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.992
I'm so grateful to you.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.204
Oh, don't be silly.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.372
When he had me...

46:35.542 --> 46:36.710
all I could think...

46:38.045 --> 46:40.005
you'd come to take care of me.

46:43.175 --> 46:44.426
I was so proud.

46:45.928 --> 46:46.929
I love you.

46:56.396 --> 46:57.231
Sleep.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.211
(phone ringing)

47:57.457 --> 48:00.085
Took his weapon, then shot him.
Maybe the same piece.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.547
You heard about the fight
between him and LaRue?

48:03.630 --> 48:04.840
Yeah, I got it on the way.

48:04.923 --> 48:06.717
I want J.D. in for questioning.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.347
Two weeks, Frank,
I was gonna bring him in.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.851
(radio chatter)

48:33.869 --> 48:36.330
(thunder rumbling)

48:43.045 --> 48:46.131
(closing theme playing)
