Ahoy, mateys!

01:04.665 --> 01:07.366
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:08.802 --> 01:09.802
Great!

01:09.804 --> 01:11.470
To start today's adventure,

01:11.472 --> 01:14.206
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:14.208 --> 01:16.241
Yo-ho ho!

01:16.243 --> 01:19.545
- [all] Yo-ho ho!
- One more time!

01:19.547 --> 01:21.713
Yo-ho ho!

01:24.884 --> 01:27.786
[Jake] "Tiki Tree Luau!"

01:27.788 --> 01:30.489
[Skully] Woo-hoo!
Pirate mail call!

01:30.491 --> 01:31.757
- Cool!
- Awesome!

01:31.759 --> 01:34.426
- What'd we get?
- A fancy envelope.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.062
And it's addressed
to Jake's Crew.

01:37.064 --> 01:41.166
It's an invitation from our
mateys, the Tiki Trees.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.402
"Come to the Tiki Tree Luau.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.137
Celebrate the first day
of spring

01:45.139 --> 01:47.539
and meet the new
baby Tiki Trees!"

01:47.541 --> 01:50.109
I can't wait to see
the Tiny Tikis.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.543
Check it out!

01:51.545 --> 01:54.880
There's a map with an X
showing us where the party is.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.748
A map? A party?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.217
Baby Tikis?

01:58.219 --> 02:01.854
This isn't a luau,
this is a lu-wow!

02:01.856 --> 02:04.089
Mateys, you're invited, too!

02:04.091 --> 02:06.658
Let's all go celebrate
the first day of spring

02:06.660 --> 02:10.095
and meet the baby Tiki Trees
at the Tiki Tree Luau!

02:10.097 --> 02:12.464
Keep a lookout
for Gold Doubloons.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.700
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:14.702 --> 02:16.135
they'll appear.

02:16.137 --> 02:19.271
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.406
Is everybody ready?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.008
I got my sword!

02:23.010 --> 02:24.176
I got my map!

02:24.178 --> 02:26.578
And I've got my pixie dust!

02:30.049 --> 02:33.118
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

02:33.120 --> 02:35.654
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

02:35.656 --> 02:36.989
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

02:36.991 --> 02:40.292
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

02:40.294 --> 02:43.295
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

02:43.297 --> 02:45.130
<i>¶ And me </i>

02:47.901 --> 02:51.770
Ooh! We've got Pirate-y Mail!

02:51.772 --> 02:54.473
I shall be the one
to open that!

02:54.475 --> 02:56.875
It's some sort of invitation.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.544
To some sort of luau.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.746
From the Tiki Trees.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.381
Can we go?

03:02.383 --> 03:06.485
No! I dislike those
annoying wooden heads

03:06.487 --> 03:08.820
and they dislike me.

03:08.822 --> 03:12.024
[all sigh] Aye-aye, Cap'n.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.126
[gasps] What's this?

03:14.128 --> 03:16.361
Look! A treasure map!

03:16.363 --> 03:18.463
Are you sure
that's a treasure map

03:18.465 --> 03:21.333
and not just a map
to the party?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.968
Of course I'm sure.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.571
Look, it's a map of Never Land

03:25.573 --> 03:28.740
with an X marking the spot
where the treasure be.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.344
And I shall be the one
to dig it up.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.982
Happy first day of spring,
Mr. Tiki Tree.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.484
Hello, pirate friends!

03:39.486 --> 03:41.653
Thanks for inviting us
to the luau.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.223
We can't wait
for the fun to start.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.359
And to see your
adorable babies.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.295
Good! The Tiny Tikis
are up ahead.

03:50.297 --> 03:53.632
By the way,
might I ask a favor?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.602
While we finish setting up
for the luau,

03:56.604 --> 03:59.338
could you watch
the wee ones?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.673
Sure, we'd be glad to help.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.247
Ahoy there, Tiny Tikis!

04:08.249 --> 04:10.082
[chattering, laughing]

04:10.084 --> 04:14.152
Yay hey, no way!
They are too cute.

04:17.924 --> 04:23.128
Blast! The puny pirates
have beaten me to the
buried treasure again.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.397
It don't look to me, sir,
like they be huntin'

04:25.399 --> 04:26.999
much in the way of treasure.

04:27.001 --> 04:31.270
[Bones] Unless there's gold
in them there diapers.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.939
I'm certain the popinjays
are waiting

04:33.941 --> 04:37.276
until the coast is clear
before digging.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.011
We must beat them to it!

04:39.013 --> 04:41.346
They certainly are having fun.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.082
Too bad we aren't
little baby Tiki Trees,

04:44.084 --> 04:45.951
then we could have fun, too.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.287
Why, that's ridicul...

04:48.289 --> 04:51.890
Bones, once again
you've shown how good you are

04:51.892 --> 04:55.093
at reflecting my genius.

04:55.095 --> 04:59.665
Little baby Tiki Trees
we shall be.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.835
Here's a great story.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.705
<i>The Tiki Who Cried "Woodsman!"</i>

05:06.707 --> 05:10.509
"Once upon a time,
a young Tiki Tree cried,

05:10.511 --> 05:14.546
'Help! Woodsman!
Here to chop down trees!'

05:14.548 --> 05:16.982
The other Tikis got scared

05:16.984 --> 05:19.551
but there really was
no woodsman."

05:19.553 --> 05:23.588
Look, Skully, four more babies.

05:23.590 --> 05:27.659
Wait a minute,
those aren't Tikis.
That's Hook and his crew!

05:27.661 --> 05:29.528
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.430
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.165
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.566
Let's have some fun with 'em!

05:34.568 --> 05:37.336
If they wanna be babies,
let 'em be babies.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.105
- Keep readin', Izz.
- OK.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.607
"The older Tikis
told the youngster,

05:42.609 --> 05:45.677
'You must never say
something that isn't true,'

05:45.679 --> 05:48.547
but the young Tiki Tree
didn't listen.

05:48.549 --> 05:53.719
The next day the young Tiki
really did see a woodsman
approaching!"

05:53.721 --> 05:56.421
- No!
- [all gasp]

05:56.423 --> 06:00.225
I mean, goo-goo?
Ba-ba?

06:00.227 --> 06:03.829
Um, I think that means
he wants his baby bottle!

06:03.831 --> 06:06.064
Let's give them all bottles!

06:06.066 --> 06:09.501
The popinjays
fell for me trick!

06:09.503 --> 06:12.738
They actually
believe we're...

06:12.740 --> 06:14.773
There you go, little one!

06:14.775 --> 06:20.245
A bottle of nice warm tree sap.
Yum, yum, yum.

06:23.850 --> 06:24.916
[burping]

06:24.918 --> 06:28.086
Uh-oh. These little guys
haven't burped.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.122
Help me out, mateys!

06:31.257 --> 06:32.324
[all burping]

06:32.326 --> 06:37.996
[burps] Excuse m...
I mean, uh, goo-goo?

06:37.998 --> 06:41.867
Come on, baby,
give us a burp.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.435
[clears throat]
Burp.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.004
Atta boy! We did it.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.840
We fed and burped
the baby Tikis

06:48.842 --> 06:51.410
and we got four Gold Doubloons!

06:51.412 --> 06:55.747
Let's grab 'em and go figure out
what the babies want next!

06:56.516 --> 06:59.184
How about pinecone pacifiers?

06:59.186 --> 07:01.720
There's enough for everybody!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.522
Here you go, baby.

07:07.627 --> 07:08.994
[groans]

07:08.996 --> 07:13.198
Awesome! They're all enjoying
pinecone pacifiers.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.368
[gasps]

07:16.370 --> 07:19.104
How did you babies
get these tools?

07:20.072 --> 07:21.473
These aren't toys.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.409
Yeah. [chuckles]
What's to dig?

07:24.411 --> 07:27.212
It's not like the invitation map
we used to get here

07:27.214 --> 07:30.482
- was a treasure map.
- [all spit]

07:30.484 --> 07:34.486
You heard that bird,
there is no treasure!

07:34.488 --> 07:36.822
Quickly, time to make
our escape.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.891
- Oof!
- [laughs]

07:39.893 --> 07:44.629
I guess they didn't enjoy
their pinecone pacifiers.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.698
[giggling]

07:46.700 --> 07:49.734
Wait, babies! Stop right there!

07:49.736 --> 07:52.170
Those babies are going,
going, gone!

07:52.172 --> 07:54.606
We gotta get 'em back.
Let's roll.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.278
[Hook] Step lively, men.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.814
Aw, how cute.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.485
The adorable little saplings
followed us!

08:08.721 --> 08:11.456
I will admit they are
kind of cute, but...

08:11.458 --> 08:15.360
[gasps] That's not cute,
it's dangerous!

08:15.362 --> 08:17.362
Shoo! Go back, babies!

08:17.364 --> 08:19.898
[chattering]

08:19.900 --> 08:23.368
No, no! I'm not playing,
I'm commanding.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.303
Go back, I tell you!

08:25.305 --> 08:27.973
Captain Hook! Stop moving!

08:27.975 --> 08:29.908
The babies think
you're playing a game

08:29.910 --> 08:31.776
and are playing along
with you.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.412
What in Never Land?!

08:34.414 --> 08:36.348
[all shouting]

08:39.252 --> 08:43.421
Oh... Oh dear,
we're in a real pickle.

08:43.423 --> 08:47.626
This is an emergency.
Pixie dust away!

08:49.095 --> 08:50.495
[screaming]

08:51.998 --> 08:54.900
- [all screaming]
- Gotcha!

08:54.902 --> 08:57.569
- Thank you, Izzy.
- Thank you, Izzy.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.572
We didn't know the forest
moppets followed us,

09:00.574 --> 09:01.840
that's the truth.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.376
I know, Captain Hook,
but you and your crew

09:04.378 --> 09:06.912
shouldn't have been
acting like babies.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.615
We saved the baby Tiki Trees

09:10.617 --> 09:13.351
and got five more
Gold Doubloons!

09:13.353 --> 09:15.353
But they keep
playin' with 'em!

09:15.355 --> 09:17.522
Shiny!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.161
<i>¶ Hu-hoy!</i>
<i>Ah-ee-oo! ¶</i>

09:23.163 --> 09:26.298

<i>Ah-ee-oo! ¶</i>

10:02.169 --> 10:04.536
<i>¶ Everybody raise</i>

¶ To the first day of spring

10:07.608 --> 10:09.240
<i>¶ Ha-hoo </i>

10:09.242 --> 10:11.543
Hey, mon,
Jake tells me

10:11.545 --> 10:14.579
you were worried
about our little ones.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.716
The moppets were in danger,
as was I!

10:17.718 --> 10:20.251
Still, it's nice
to know you care.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.320
Didn't think you
had it in you, Hook.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.123
I'm glad you came to our party.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.492
You're glad I...?

10:27.494 --> 10:30.662
I mean, thank you
for inviting me.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.901
Ew. And thank you.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.137
[gurgling]

10:39.139 --> 10:41.039
Oh, very well.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.643
[laughing]

10:46.112 --> 10:49.347
Thanks for helping us take care
of the baby Tikis, mateys!

10:49.349 --> 10:51.483
Now let's put all
our Gold Doubloons

10:51.485 --> 10:53.885
into our Team Treasure Chest.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.328
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:03.330 --> 11:05.530
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:05.532 --> 11:07.465

11:10.404 --> 11:12.937
C'mon, count with us!

11:14.240 --> 11:15.440
Yeah!

11:16.342 --> 11:19.778
[Izzy] One, two, three, four...

11:19.780 --> 11:24.082
[Jake] Five, six, seven,
eight, nine!

11:24.084 --> 11:27.385
Yo ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:27.387 --> 11:29.788
we got nine Gold Doubloons.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.758
The Pirate Island Luau goes on!

11:34.627 --> 11:37.095
- Way hey.
- [laughing]

11:37.097 --> 11:39.497
[all chattering, cheering]

11:45.604 --> 11:47.739
<i>¶ Tiki, tiki,</i>
<i>limbo dancing ¶</i>

11:47.741 --> 11:51.109
Ready, Cap'n!
You can do it, sir!

11:52.578 --> 11:55.880
I will master
this limbo dance yet!

11:57.550 --> 12:00.385
- [screaming]
- [water splashing]

12:00.387 --> 12:03.722
[laughing] You did it, sir.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.658
You did it, eh... sir?

12:08.527 --> 12:12.097
Barnacles. Limbo schmimbo.

12:16.335 --> 12:17.936
[Jake] "Captain Who?"

12:18.871 --> 12:20.472
[Hook] Step livelier, men!

12:20.474 --> 12:24.309
We're treasure hunters,
not sightseers!

12:24.311 --> 12:27.278
Ain't it a wee bit hot
fer treasure huntin'?

12:27.280 --> 12:31.883
Ooh! That creek looks perfect
fer dippin' achin' feets

12:31.885 --> 12:33.618
and toes too.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.555
Uh, maybe it's time for
a little break, Cap'n?

12:37.557 --> 12:40.058
Nonsense. Keep walking.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.760
[groans]

12:41.762 --> 12:45.697
I sure wish the cap'n
would stop bossing us around.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.066
Listen up, ye simperin' swabs...

12:48.068 --> 12:49.868
[grunting]

12:49.870 --> 12:52.170
Who's the captain here?

12:52.172 --> 12:53.638
You are.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.908
Aye! And don't you
be forgettin' it.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.744
Every crew needs a captain
to keep it on course

12:59.746 --> 13:02.981
and this crew's captain is...
whoa!

13:02.983 --> 13:05.450
[grunting]

13:05.452 --> 13:09.287
Cap'n? Oh no, it's too late.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.591
Careful, boys, those flowers
are Forget-Me Flowers.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.661
Oi! One whiff o' them
Forgetty Flowers

13:16.663 --> 13:19.097
and it makes ya
forget things.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.467
A-are you OK, Cap'n?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.269
Captain who?

13:24.271 --> 13:25.436
Captain Hook.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.905
Who's Hook?

13:26.907 --> 13:28.907
You're Hook!

13:28.909 --> 13:31.476
Me hook? What about me hook?

13:31.478 --> 13:34.846
Not your hook, Captain,
you're Captain Hook!

13:34.848 --> 13:38.216
Ugh, you two are
makin' me head hurt.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.151
Ugh, mine too.

13:40.153 --> 13:45.323
Oh dear, dear me.
This is a briny pickle indeed.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.827
Say, gentlemen,
you're dressed like...

13:48.829 --> 13:49.894
...pirates!

13:49.896 --> 13:54.632
We're all pirates.
[chuckles] How fun!

13:54.634 --> 13:56.201
Oh, dear.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.170
It's nice having a smiling,
happy Cap'n Hook,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.606
even if he doesn't know
he's Cap'n Hook.

14:01.608 --> 14:05.543
I suppose he'll eventually
remember who he is, right?

14:05.545 --> 14:08.913
I hope so... seein' as we
haven't the foggiest notion

14:08.915 --> 14:10.014
how to fix 'im.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.816
Well, until we fix him,

14:11.818 --> 14:13.852
we'll just have to make him
part of the crew.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.788
[chuckles] Welcome to
the crew, Cap'n,

14:16.790 --> 14:19.724
uh... I mean, Mr. Hook.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.960
Glad to have you on board.
Hee-hee!

14:21.962 --> 14:25.296
- Aye!
- Why thank you, kind sirs.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.533
So what are we pirates
up to today?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.236
[stammers] Anything you want.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.805
Uh, let's dip our feets
in the creek.

14:33.807 --> 14:36.975
No way, 'tis snackin' time
says I.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.211
Um... Maybe the best thing
for us to do

14:40.213 --> 14:42.513
is continue
looking for treasure.

14:42.515 --> 14:46.618
Oh, splendid idea.
Which way do we go?

14:46.620 --> 14:49.153
I say we go this way.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.823
I was thinkin'
we'd go this way.

14:51.825 --> 14:55.493
A-actually, this way would be
the way to go. I...

14:55.495 --> 14:58.162
Good idea, boys. Lead the way.

14:58.164 --> 15:03.902
Oh dear, every crew does need
a captain to keep 'em on course.

15:03.904 --> 15:07.272
I sure wish we had a cap'n.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.474
Me too.

15:09.476 --> 15:13.511
<i>¶ Over sand, over dune</i>

Do we ever need your help.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.131
What's the trouble, Mr. Smee?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.867
The cap'n smelled
the Forget-Me Flowers

15:35.869 --> 15:37.936
and forgot that he's cap'n!

15:37.938 --> 15:39.771
And that's a problem?

15:39.773 --> 15:43.574
Oh goody! Are these
adorable scamps here

15:43.576 --> 15:46.044
to join our merry crew?

15:46.046 --> 15:49.714
You gotta help us get
our ol' cranky cap'n back!

15:49.716 --> 15:51.716
We're lost without him!

15:51.718 --> 15:53.451
[giggling]

15:53.453 --> 15:57.288
Jake, how are we gonna
get Captain Hook to remember
who he is?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.991
Maybe if we show him things
that he loves,

15:59.993 --> 16:01.559
he'll recognize them,

16:01.561 --> 16:04.095
and then he'll remember
he's Captain Hook!

16:04.097 --> 16:06.030
That's a great idea.

Captain... uh, I mean,
Mr. Hook,

16:34.060 --> 16:36.394
we've got a little
surprise for ya.

16:36.396 --> 16:40.398
Ooh, goody, I love surprises.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.035
At least I think I do.
I don't really remember.

16:44.037 --> 16:49.774
But surely you gotta remember...
the    <i>Jolly Roger!</i>

16:49.776 --> 16:54.212
[gasps] Glory gracious,
what a ship.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.314
He remembers!

16:56.316 --> 17:02.153
Why, her lucky captain must be
ever so proud. Whomever he is.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.823
- He doesn't remember.
- Aw, coconuts!

17:05.825 --> 17:07.925
We'll have to try
something else,

17:07.927 --> 17:10.094
something he could
never forget.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.597
His favorite food.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.233
Codfish Casserole!

17:15.235 --> 17:19.003
Here ya go, sir,
fresh from the galley.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.040
Just the way you like it.
[chuckles]

17:22.042 --> 17:24.842
Well, if you say so.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.978
[sniffs, groans]

17:26.980 --> 17:29.247
I've lost me appetite.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.015
Did you hear that?

17:31.017 --> 17:34.986
Yeah, he doesn't remember
liking Codfish Casserole.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.755
[sighs] What're we gonna do?!

17:37.757 --> 17:42.727
Well, what does Captain Hook
love more than anything?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.228
Treasure!

17:44.230 --> 17:47.732
So, let's go help him
find treasure.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.069
Maybe that will help him
remember who he is.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.224
Ah, Never Land.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.027
What a magical place.

18:16.029 --> 18:19.030
There are so many
wonderful treasures to find.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.432
[gasps] So it's working?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.801
You're starting
to remember everything?

18:23.803 --> 18:26.971
- Nope, not a thing.
- [all groan]

18:31.343 --> 18:35.713
This be terrible. We're doomed
to be a crew without a captain.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.183
Like a barnacle
without a boat.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.386
Don't give up yet, mates.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.423
But we just helped him find
all kinds of treasure

18:45.425 --> 18:48.659
and he still can't remember
who he is.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.329
If'n only he could remember
something

18:51.331 --> 18:53.030
that he'd never forget.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.600
Like his best-fittin' boots.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.169
Or an old friend.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.372
An old friend. That's it!

19:01.374 --> 19:04.809
I know someone we haven't
shown the captain yet.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.045
Someone he's sure to remember.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.048
Someone he could never forget.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.353
[Jake] Right this way, mateys.

19:15.355 --> 19:19.390
- Here we are.
- [laughs] Genius!

19:19.392 --> 19:22.693
[all] Tick-Tock Croc!

19:22.695 --> 19:26.531
If anyone can snap
the cap'n back to his
ol' croc-fearing self,

19:26.533 --> 19:28.332
it's Tick-Tock Croc!

19:28.334 --> 19:32.403
Come on, mateys! I'll lead
the pirate hike this time!

19:32.405 --> 19:34.605
Wait! Watch out for the...

19:34.607 --> 19:36.407
Whoa!

19:38.410 --> 19:40.845
Oh, why hello there, fella.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.182
Sorry for disturbing
your sleepy-weepys.

19:44.184 --> 19:48.386
- Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.
- [growls]

19:48.388 --> 19:50.821
Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock...

19:50.823 --> 19:53.925
- Croc?
- [Tick-Tock Croc growls]

19:53.927 --> 19:56.327
You're Tick-Tock Croc.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.462
[growling]

19:58.464 --> 20:00.364
And that means...

20:00.366 --> 20:02.400
...I am Captain Hook!

20:02.402 --> 20:05.803
Hurrah! I am Captain Hook.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.538
[roaring]

20:07.540 --> 20:11.609
Save me, Smee! Save me!

20:11.611 --> 20:15.046
Oh, Cap'n, you're back!

20:15.048 --> 20:18.950
- Glorious day!
- Hip hip hooray!

20:18.952 --> 20:23.221
- You just need a little rest...
- Yo-ho, way to go!

20:23.223 --> 20:26.023
We helped Captain Hook
remember who he is

20:26.025 --> 20:28.659
and we got four Gold Doubloons!

20:28.661 --> 20:30.628
Let's grab 'em and go!

20:32.064 --> 20:35.900
Smee, I demand you tell me
what's going on!

20:35.902 --> 20:38.536
[stammering] Well, now, Cap'n,
it's a...

20:38.538 --> 20:42.139
it's quite a... a funny story.
You see but...

20:42.141 --> 20:43.741
[Tick-Tock Croc growls]

20:46.778 --> 20:49.580
- Uh-oh, clear the decks!
- [all screaming]

20:55.354 --> 20:57.388
Nice Crocky!

20:57.390 --> 21:00.291
Izzy, this is an emergency!

21:00.293 --> 21:02.460
Pixie dust away!

21:02.462 --> 21:04.528
Whoa!

21:06.465 --> 21:07.898
Huh?

21:09.201 --> 21:11.769
Yay-hey, yes way!

21:11.771 --> 21:14.171
We all safely got away
from the croc

21:14.173 --> 21:17.174
and we got four more
Gold Doubloons.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.010
Let's grab 'em and go!

21:19.845 --> 21:22.313
Back to the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

21:22.315 --> 21:24.248
Aye-aye, Cap'n!

21:24.250 --> 21:29.520
And when we get there,
Smee, I want Codfish Casserole
for dinner.

21:29.522 --> 21:33.891
Then ya swabs
swab the deck and then...

21:36.828 --> 21:40.131
Thanks for helping Captain Hook
remember who he is, mateys.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.799
Now let's count
our Gold Doubloons

21:41.801 --> 21:44.335
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.778

[Jake] Yo ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:16.803 --> 22:19.603
we got eight Gold Doubloons.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.273
You know, I was just thinkin'...

22:22.275 --> 22:26.811
It's too bad we had to
turn Captain Hook back
into a sneaky snook.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.713
Well, think of it this way.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.682
Things just wouldn't be
as much fun around here
without him.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.385
And don't you forget it.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.554
[all laughing]

22:38.824 --> 22:41.959
[Hook] Scrape every barnacle
off the <i>Jolly Roger</i>

22:41.961 --> 22:45.096
then hoist the sails
and raise the anchor.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.065
Scraping barnacles, Cap'n!
