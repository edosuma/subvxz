WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:35.734 --> 01:36.818
Hey!

01:37.243 --> 01:39.033
This is boring.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.794
I wish I had someone to play with.

01:51.817 --> 01:53.918
With the help of the
Sorceress' book of magic...

01:53.919 --> 01:56.046
I've made a fantastic discovery.

02:01.427 --> 02:03.728
My equations and the Sorceress' spells...

02:03.729 --> 02:08.792
prove another universe, the Dark
Dimension, exists very close to ours.

02:09.801 --> 02:13.438
This closeness is what keeps the
delicate balance between science...

02:13.439 --> 02:15.270
and sorcery on Eternia.

02:16.709 --> 02:19.906
Could the barrier ever break down?
Let's hope not!

02:22.414 --> 02:25.950
That thing looked hungry!
I know just how it feels.

02:25.951 --> 02:27.714
Lets eat!

02:43.369 --> 02:45.667
I wonder if there's something
to play with in here.

02:46.372 --> 02:50.138
I'm tired of playing alone.
Maybe he wants to play!

02:51.176 --> 02:53.804
From the darkest dimension
to the brightest of day,

02:54.012 --> 02:57.106
Daimar the Demon, please come out and play.

03:06.425 --> 03:07.496
Wow, it worked!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.179
Hey let's go outside and play.

03:17.436 --> 03:20.269
MAGlC

03:33.118 --> 03:34.346
What was that?

03:34.753 --> 03:36.053
W-What was what?

03:36.054 --> 03:38.750
It felt cold, like a door opening.

03:43.395 --> 03:45.329
Since when is this place haunted?

03:54.139 --> 03:56.073
What brought that on?

03:56.308 --> 03:59.766
Magic, and I think I know who
maybe at the bottom of this.

04:03.015 --> 04:04.107
Aha!

04:08.253 --> 04:10.414
Now where's Orko?

04:11.190 --> 04:12.214
Orko...

04:12.658 --> 04:14.225
Orko!

04:14.226 --> 04:16.591
Uh-oh. Looks like I'm in in trouble.

04:20.699 --> 04:22.758
I know a place we can hide.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.334
Look, the picture of Daimar is gone!

04:28.273 --> 04:29.897
Someone has summoned Daimar the

04:29.922 --> 04:31.755
Demon, from the Dark Dimension...

04:34.580 --> 04:36.343
and I think you were right about Orko.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.549
We better find him soon.

04:38.550 --> 04:41.285
According to this,
Daimar will spin a cocoon...

04:41.286 --> 04:44.222
and when he comes out,
his army of demons...

04:44.223 --> 04:47.989
will come through a pandimensional
rift to conquer Eternia.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.284
Adam, we need help!

04:50.863 --> 04:53.423
By the power of Grayskull.

04:59.938 --> 05:02.736
Oh, never a moment's rest.

05:03.942 --> 05:07.969
I have the power!

05:20.926 --> 05:24.453
Daimar has to be found and sent
back to the Dark Dimension.

05:24.696 --> 05:29.531
Yes, his presence is causing
all these strange things to happen.

05:29.701 --> 05:32.363
We'll bring him back. Let's go!

05:47.419 --> 05:48.784
He-Man, is something wrong?

05:49.021 --> 05:51.455
I'll tell you all about it on the
way to Castle Grayskull.

05:51.757 --> 05:54.458
- Grayskull?
- Yes. I'm hoping the Sorceress...

05:54.459 --> 05:56.450
can help me find Orko.

06:25.958 --> 06:28.192
You sent for me, Skeletor?

06:28.193 --> 06:32.063
Yes, my instruments show
unusual power surges...

06:32.064 --> 06:33.827
near Randor's Palace.

06:35.701 --> 06:37.061
I want you to go investigate this.

06:46.211 --> 06:47.576
What is this?

06:48.680 --> 06:50.580
You'll pay for this, you witch.

06:52.985 --> 06:54.213
I didn't do it!

06:55.320 --> 06:56.378
No...

06:56.922 --> 06:58.514
You did'nt...

06:59.191 --> 07:01.557
But who did? -I don't know.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.054
These power surges are changing reality.

07:05.330 --> 07:07.798
They drained my strength for a moment.

07:07.966 --> 07:12.699
I must have this power.
Find it for me and quickly!

07:19.845 --> 07:24.179
I will, but for me, not for you.

07:40.065 --> 07:43.967
At last! My spell of liquid
light is almost finished.

07:53.645 --> 07:55.306
It's ruined!

08:00.552 --> 08:03.919
He-Man, something is draining my power.

08:06.558 --> 08:08.526
The Sorceress is calling me.

08:09.661 --> 08:11.492
Come to Grayskull.

08:11.897 --> 08:13.990
We're on our way, Sorceress.

08:14.199 --> 08:15.689
Hurry, Battle Cat!

08:18.437 --> 08:22.703
I hope He-Man's having better luck
searching for Orko than we've had.

08:24.943 --> 08:26.240
Evil-Lyn!

08:26.745 --> 08:29.771
Your luck, just ran out.

08:31.683 --> 08:33.378
I can't move!

08:34.820 --> 08:38.586
We've detected strange power
surges coming from here.

08:38.690 --> 08:40.558
What's that?

08:40.558 --> 08:42.458
MAGlC

08:42.794 --> 08:44.728
The book of magic.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.788
That must be the source of the power.

08:49.167 --> 08:51.567
I'll be back when I've mastered it.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.902
Thank Goodness! We can move again...

08:58.076 --> 09:01.512
but there may be no way to stop Evil-Lyn.

09:03.615 --> 09:07.244
It's only a little farther to Grayskull.
We'll be safe there.

09:08.653 --> 09:12.487
I'm so sleepy.
I think I'm going to sleep.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.589
Okay, let's stop and rest.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.528
Good idea, Daimar.

09:51.897 --> 09:53.489
Vines aren't supposed to do that.

09:53.865 --> 09:56.390
Tell them that!
Let's not hang around.

10:12.551 --> 10:14.485
Here's the spell I need.

10:16.054 --> 10:21.082
Now, Skeletor,
we'll see how powerful you really are.

10:23.495 --> 10:24.792
What do you want?

10:25.263 --> 10:27.356
Your powers, Skeletor...

10:27.666 --> 10:29.600
and now I will have it.

10:32.070 --> 10:34.732
Evil-Lyn, I am not amused.

10:35.974 --> 10:38.943
I think you're hiding something, witch.

10:39.911 --> 10:42.709
And I'm going to find out, what.

10:52.357 --> 10:53.517
Daimar?

10:56.962 --> 10:59.192
I guess he's still sleeping.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.599
If what you told me is
true, witch...

11:07.806 --> 11:10.400
soon I will rule Eternia.

11:31.363 --> 11:34.992
All of Eternia is being affected
by the power surges.

11:37.602 --> 11:40.571
The city of Eternos. It's in ruins!

11:42.407 --> 11:43.669
My goodness!

11:44.442 --> 11:46.569
The effects seem to be worsening.

11:50.915 --> 11:54.851
They are, Your Majesty, and they'll
continue to until we find Orko.

12:09.668 --> 12:11.932
Almost to Castle Grayskull.

12:16.341 --> 12:17.933
Now what?

12:29.687 --> 12:31.416
We were lucky that time.

12:31.456 --> 12:32.718
I'll say.

12:33.191 --> 12:35.955
Let's get outta here
before our luck changes.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.424
Daimar.

12:44.102 --> 12:45.296
Daimar!

13:02.087 --> 13:04.282
By the power of Grayskull.

13:04.656 --> 13:06.715
I command the Jawbridge...

13:07.359 --> 13:08.656
Open!

13:13.999 --> 13:16.991
If Orko's not here,
the Sorceress will know where he is.

13:17.435 --> 13:20.131
I hope she knows what that is.

13:32.751 --> 13:33.809
Teela...

13:34.185 --> 13:35.675
Battle cat.

13:36.221 --> 13:38.212
Get the Sorceress.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.091
Sorceress!

13:45.630 --> 13:46.790
Teela...

13:46.998 --> 13:48.192
here.

13:51.903 --> 13:54.104
He-Man is trapped by
the drawbridge.

13:54.105 --> 13:56.767
Ah! I cannot help.

14:11.756 --> 14:13.519
There are visitors outside.

14:14.292 --> 14:16.627
One who searches for you,

14:16.628 --> 14:18.960
and the one for whom you search.

14:29.841 --> 14:32.969
Daimar, you've led us a long chase.

14:36.114 --> 14:40.312
We do, what our destinies, demand.

14:49.994 --> 14:51.325
An energy field.

15:00.071 --> 15:01.368
Who are you?

15:02.006 --> 15:04.133
I am Daimar...

15:04.843 --> 15:08.210
King of the Dark Dimension.

15:08.446 --> 15:11.006
Take him! His powers must be mine.

15:19.124 --> 15:21.888
Not bad. Now try this.

15:30.502 --> 15:33.198
Come to me, demons.

15:33.471 --> 15:36.099
Eternia is ours.

15:39.878 --> 15:41.607
Not yet it isn't, Daimar.

16:06.905 --> 16:09.635
I cannot control Daimar,

16:09.908 --> 16:12.604
so I will conquer him!

16:14.913 --> 16:19.145
Now, little nuisance,
this will keep you out of my way.

16:28.259 --> 16:30.489
This bolo should hold him.

16:34.632 --> 16:37.032
You haven't had the last laugh yet, Daimar.

16:39.103 --> 16:41.833
Anybody wanna buy a used bolo?

16:42.006 --> 16:43.439
Enough of this.

16:44.943 --> 16:47.173
I can't break free.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.269
Daimar, stop!

16:49.480 --> 16:50.572
Orko, get back.

16:50.848 --> 16:53.339
You're my friend. How can you attack us!

16:53.851 --> 16:57.617
It is my destiny.
- No, Daimar...

16:58.189 --> 16:59.884
Daimar, you're wrong.

17:00.058 --> 17:03.459
You can create your own destiny.
You can change.

17:03.828 --> 17:05.762
If you really want to.

17:07.265 --> 17:09.199
You and Orko are friends.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.664
Wouldn't you rather have

17:10.689 --> 17:12.069
a life full with friends...

17:12.069 --> 17:13.123
Being with those who

17:13.147 --> 17:14.858
really care about you for yourself...

17:15.039 --> 17:16.923
instead of those who use you for

17:16.948 --> 17:19.276
their own selfish violent reasons?

17:19.277 --> 17:21.643
No!
Think, Daimar. Think!

17:22.213 --> 17:24.545
I don't like this, Skeletor.

17:25.349 --> 17:27.477
He-Man, you are a fool!

17:28.051 --> 17:30.119
Daimar was not born to think,

17:30.144 --> 17:32.256
only to serve his superiors.

17:32.257 --> 17:34.953
He will follow my orders.

17:35.326 --> 17:36.832
Yes!
Is that true, Daimar?

17:36.857 --> 17:38.478
You have an opportunity...

17:38.696 --> 17:40.960
to change your destiny. Don't pass it up.

17:43.301 --> 17:44.790
Perhaps we can help Daimar

17:44.815 --> 17:46.852
make up his mind.

17:48.706 --> 17:51.334
The light! I can't see.

17:54.579 --> 17:58.743
This Freeze Ray will hold him until
we get him back to Snake Mountain.

18:08.326 --> 18:09.384
What?

18:11.829 --> 18:13.990
Teela, Orko, hurry.

18:18.636 --> 18:21.575
Daimar,
break out of the stun field.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.790
You can do it.

18:23.441 --> 18:27.002
We've got to break loose.
Use the Freeze Ray on He-Man.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.514
Now you've got me mad, He-Man.

18:44.495 --> 18:48.295
Join me, Daimar,
we'll rule Eternia together!

18:49.033 --> 18:50.033
No!

18:50.568 --> 18:54.197
I choose my own
destiny, Skeletor...

18:54.772 --> 18:58.139
and it is not with the likes of you.

19:03.348 --> 19:04.348
No!

19:05.183 --> 19:07.981
Time to go for a ride, Skeletor.

19:08.219 --> 19:09.982
A long ride.

19:16.794 --> 19:18.921
You were right, He-Man.

19:19.397 --> 19:21.865
My destiny, is mine.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.530
I would like you for a friend.

19:24.869 --> 19:28.236
- I'd like that.
- Don't forget me!

19:30.641 --> 19:34.168
No, little friend,
I will not forget you.

19:34.445 --> 19:37.812
But now I must return
to my dimension.

19:38.182 --> 19:40.275
We will all meet again.

20:11.282 --> 20:13.375
I sure feel good about everything.

20:13.551 --> 20:17.954
Well, you should. Today you
found something... very precious.

20:18.156 --> 20:19.623
I did? What?

20:20.191 --> 20:22.022
A friend.

20:30.334 --> 20:31.534
Well, that Daimar was really

20:31.559 --> 20:32.758
quite a fellow, wasn't he?

20:32.759 --> 20:33.594
Orko had no idea just

20:33.664 --> 20:34.671
what he was getting into

20:34.672 --> 20:36.297
with his mixed-up magic spell.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.541
But he soon found out

20:37.542 --> 20:38.328
that he'd let loose

20:38.353 --> 20:39.609
something he couldn't handle.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.222
Now, we know that in real life there

20:41.247 --> 20:42.745
aren't any magic spells or demons,

20:42.746 --> 20:44.043
but there are problems.

20:44.115 --> 20:44.945
And, just like Orko,

20:44.970 --> 20:46.835
sometimes you'll find you've got one that's

20:46.918 --> 20:48.173
too big for you to handle.

20:48.198 --> 20:49.619
At times like that, remember

20:49.620 --> 20:50.742
there are a lot of people out

20:50.766 --> 20:52.055
there who really care about you.

20:52.056 --> 20:52.946
So talk to them.

20:52.971 --> 20:54.640
Telling them what's wrong is

20:54.792 --> 20:57.192
the first step toward making things right!
