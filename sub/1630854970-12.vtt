00:04.086 --> 00:06.423
<i>It's a rare treat
when the Premier League title</i>

00:06.423 --> 00:08.550
<i>comes down
to the last match of the season.</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:11.678
And, Thierry,
if the Greyhounds win on Sunday,

00:11.678 --> 00:17.267
and Manchester City loses or draws,
AFC Richmond will actually win the league.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.145
Incredible.
And you picked them to finish last.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.188
Hey, so did you.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.650
Sorry, Gary. I only remember my victories.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.694
<i>I have no room in my brain
for anything else.</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:29.530
<i>Well, it should be a great match.</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:32.783
<i>The last time Richmond played West Ham
though, things got ugly.</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:35.035
<i>That wasn't football.
It was a crime scene.</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:36.745
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

00:36.745 --> 00:40.332
<i>Rupert Mannion has been accused
of an inappropriate relationship</i>

00:40.332 --> 00:41.667
<i>by a former assistant,</i>

00:41.667 --> 00:44.419
- <i>putting the team owner in hot water.</i>
- <i>Hot water?</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:48.465
<i>That man is boiling. If he had noodles
in his pockets, he could make a soup.</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:52.594
<i>My nan made a delicious pocket soup.
Bit like a minestrone.</i>

00:52.594 --> 00:55.222
<i>Personally, I thought
he should have stayed with Rebecca Welton.</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:57.558
<i>Now, they were a power couple.</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:00.310
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.193
Morning, Rebecca.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.821
- Morning, Ted.
- Hi.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.580
Yeah.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.543
So, do you--

01:27.087 --> 01:28.463
You know, do you want to talk about it?

01:30.966 --> 01:33.343
I'm not really ready to talk about it yet.

01:36.054 --> 01:36.889
Okay.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.599
Good morning!

01:40.893 --> 01:44.479
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
what a night, what a night.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.443
Sorry for all the noise.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.614
Morning, nerds.
You're welcome for all the noise.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.617
Milady.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.454
Rebecca, I hope you don't mind.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.664
I went through your wardrobe
and borrowed this dress.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.876
It's a blazer. But, yes. Help yourself.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.463
Hey, thanks again
for letting us all crash here last night.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.882
You know-- When I got Beard's text saying

02:11.882 --> 02:14.009
that there was a deadly gas leak
in the neighborhood,

02:14.009 --> 02:16.762
I just assumed he was bragging
about one of his epic toots.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.603
Isn't that crazy that this is gonna be
the last time we wake up like this?

02:26.188 --> 02:28.941
I mean, the last and first time.
But, still, you know.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.443
No, no, no.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.446
Yeah.
Boss don't want to talk about it yet.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.699
It's not that I refuse
to talk about you going home, Ted.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.160
It's that I refuse to accept
that you are not coming back.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.581
God. Boss.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.167
I'm right there with you.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.465
I'll start in the guest rooms.

02:57.302 --> 03:01.348
- No! No, no! No.
- No. No, no. Please. Please--

03:01.348 --> 03:03.475
Those ropes are not garbage.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.519
Some of it's dirty on purpose.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.801
Hear ye, hear ye,
this locker room is now in session.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.512
All rise for the Honorable Judge McAdoo.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.065
Silence!

03:53.108 --> 03:54.109
Be seated.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.528
Court Treasurer.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.656
Are there any unresolved fines
from this season?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.241
There are, Your Honor.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.368
And please remember that all fines

04:03.368 --> 04:07.122
will go towards funding our end-of-season
party this Sunday night at the restaurant.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.834
Very well. Bailiff.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.419
Please bring forth the receptacle.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.963
The assistant kitman has it.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.176
Assistant to the kitman.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.554
Court Treasurer. Release the fines.

04:26.350 --> 04:30.145
"Jan Maas. Late for training. £200."

04:31.772 --> 04:33.357
- That's fair.
- Naughty boy.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.691
"Dani Rojas.

04:35.567 --> 04:39.780
Not texting 'happy birthday'
on a teammate's birthday. £100."

04:40.656 --> 04:41.698
Objection, Your Honor.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.952
I did put a tiny, little heart
on someone else's "happy birthday."

04:46.078 --> 04:46.912
Overruled!

04:48.705 --> 04:50.082
"Jamie Tartt.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.254
Falling asleep during
team meditation training. £200."

04:55.254 --> 04:56.630
Wow. You fell asleep?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.924
- Bro, everyone was sleeping, man.
- Nah, not me.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.801
I was just the only one who was snoring.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.514
Hey. Wait.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.518
- Is there anything else?
- That is all I have, Your Honor.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.438
Very well. And finally, Nathan Shelley.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.150
For missing every training session,

05:17.150 --> 05:20.946
every match and every team dinner
this season,

05:22.030 --> 05:24.908
I hereby fine you £5,000!

05:25.659 --> 05:27.870
Yeah, that's fair. I mean, I deserve it.

05:27.870 --> 05:33.125
The party will now have an open bar
and live band karaoke!

05:51.810 --> 05:52.644
Hey.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.022
I'm sorry.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.357
One of these days, I'm gonna scare you.

05:58.650 --> 06:02.404
Well, that's easy.
Just ask me what I'm thinking about.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.324
What are you thinking about?

06:08.785 --> 06:09.828
Stuff.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.706
Terrifying.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.959
Good to see you, Roy.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.966
- Morning, Keeley.
- Morning.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.691
- Yo.
- Hey.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.693
What happened to you?
I thought you were right behind me.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.028
Jane had a surprise for me.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.948
- That's nice.
- My passport.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.327
Which she shredded so that I wouldn't
be able to leave the country.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.247
- Good thing you got dual citizenship, huh?
- Triple.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.084
- Vatican City is a country, baby.
- Right.

06:59.378 --> 07:03.757
Gentlemen. I can't finish the book
until the season ends, obviously.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.635
But before you leave,
I'd love to get your thoughts.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.304
Let me know if there's anything
you disagree with.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.766
I won't take it out, but I'm happy
to tell you where you're wrong.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.020
Fuck!

07:18.730 --> 07:19.898
Everything okay, Roy?

07:21.525 --> 07:23.610
How do you know
if a girl likes you or not?

07:25.612 --> 07:26.530
Well...

07:28.532 --> 07:32.327
you know, that might be a tasty,
little treat for the Diamond Dogs.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.664
No.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.667
No! No! No!

07:43.630 --> 07:45.299
So close.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.136
Can't wait to dive into this, Trent.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.762
Thank you.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.723
Nope.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.226
Derivative.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.644
Okay.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.689
Overly prosaic.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.150
Actually, I'm gonna just pop out
for a second.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.612
The press are asking if you have
any comments about Rupert's divorce.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.282
Yes, of course. But no, no comment.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.326
- Smart.
- Classy.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.703
Moving on, Leslie and I are asking

08:14.703 --> 08:16.955
if you have any comments
on Rupert's divorce.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.208
Juicier, the better. Safe space.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.959
Also no comment.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.127
Boo!

08:22.127 --> 08:25.214
Look, I'm sorry.
I just genuinely don't care anymore.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.091
What's next?

08:28.717 --> 08:31.845
We need to talk about
who we're hiring to replace Ted.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.597
I've made a list of the usual suspects,

08:35.182 --> 08:39.019
and I threw in a basketball coach from
New Zealand just to spice it up a bit.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.484
Right. I can't think about that yet.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.987
Okay. After the season then.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.408
Last thing from me. On a happier note,

08:53.408 --> 08:56.495
now that we have a guaranteed spot
in the Champions League next season...

08:59.081 --> 09:02.000
we have had many requests
to buy a piece of the club.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.420
Our value is at an all-time high,
so it's worth considering.

09:05.420 --> 09:11.134
You give up 49%, retain full control
and make a huge pile of cash.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.846
We can buy more players,
renovate the stadium.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.098
Maybe we can get
some of those fancy seats.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.141
The ones with the heaters
like they have at Tottenham.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.853
They're amazing... in February.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.272
You see,
I accidentally turned mine on last summer

09:23.272 --> 09:25.649
and nearly melted
my bottom crack together.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.487
Think about it anyway. It's only 49%.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.365
Leslie?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.871
How much would I get
if I sold the entire club?

09:39.788 --> 09:40.622
Rebecca.

09:41.707 --> 09:42.916
You can't sell the club.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.043
Why not?

09:45.627 --> 09:48.088
I mean, I only got into this
to ruin Rupert's life.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.133
And he seems to be doing
a pretty good job of that himself.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.638
So come on, Leslie. How much?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.599
I don't know.

09:58.599 --> 10:03.395
Off the top of my head,
I'd say two billion.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.482
Fuck me.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.027
Fuck me.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.158
All right, Roy.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.619
I think that's enough for today.
You can go ahead and call it.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.164
Roy, please.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.962
Whistle! Whistle!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.631
Go on, bring it in.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.216
Thank you, Roy.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.135
Coach and I didn't wanna make a big deal
about it being our last practice.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.261
Just a regular day.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.222
Yeah. Nothing special. Right?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.724
Yeah. Sure.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.143
Whatever you guys want.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.233
- That was ominous.
- What the fuck was that?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.195
What the fuck is that?

10:54.655 --> 10:56.490
What the fuck is this?

11:00.118 --> 11:04.373
<i>There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall</i>

11:04.373 --> 11:08.043
<i>And the bells in the steeple too</i>

11:08.043 --> 11:12.339
<i>And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird</i>

11:12.339 --> 11:14.967
<i>Is popping out to say "cuckoo"</i>

11:14.967 --> 11:17.970
<i>Cuckoo, cuckoo</i>

11:17.970 --> 11:21.640
<i>Regretfully they tell us
But firmly they compel us</i>

11:21.640 --> 11:24.977
<i>To say goodbye</i>

11:24.977 --> 11:28.230
<i>To you</i>

11:32.860 --> 11:36.864
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night</i>

11:36.864 --> 11:40.617
<i>We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight</i>

11:46.665 --> 11:49.877
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu</i>

11:49.877 --> 11:53.839
<i>Adieu, adieu
To yieu and yieu and yieu</i>

12:00.179 --> 12:03.891
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

12:03.891 --> 12:07.144
<i>We flit, we float
We fleetly flee, we fly</i>

12:13.609 --> 12:17.154
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

12:17.154 --> 12:20.908
<i>The sun has gone
To bed and so must I</i>

12:21.450 --> 12:25.162
<i>Adios</i>

12:25.746 --> 12:28.999
<i>Adios</i>

12:30.209 --> 12:33.629
<i>Adios</i>

12:34.463 --> 12:41.470
<i>Goodbye</i>

12:46.808 --> 12:49.144
Thank you, fellas. That was perfect.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.291
Hey, Keeley. Love those boots.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.001
Thanks.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.842
- Hey, Nate.
- Hey, Keeley. You all right?

13:19.842 --> 13:22.386
Yeah. It's so good to have you back.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.513
- Thank you. It's really good to be back.
- Yeah.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.600
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.227
- Ninety-one.
- Ninety-two.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.353
Hello, boys.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.021
- Hello, Keeley.
- Hey, Keeley. Uh-oh.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.567
- What do we got here?
- A little last-day present. One for you.

13:37.651 --> 13:38.652
- And one for you.
- All right.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.487
Don't open that
before you get on the plane!

13:41.113 --> 13:43.282
Or better yet,
just don't get on the plane.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.410
- Thanks, Keeley.
- Thanks, Keeley.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.790
Is everybody decent?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.710
One of these days, right?

13:55.836 --> 13:59.423
Okay, remember you've got
your extra press session tomorrow at noon.

13:59.423 --> 14:05.345
And you're confident, generous, excited.
You're fucking legends!

14:05.345 --> 14:06.638
Thanks, Keeley!

14:12.686 --> 14:15.189
- Keeley.
- Hi, Jamie.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.607
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah, you?

14:16.607 --> 14:18.483
Yeah, good, yeah. Mad one.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.696
Nike want to fly me to Brazil
to shoot this commercial thing.

14:22.696 --> 14:26.366
But I said to them that I wouldn't do it
unless I could have my publicist with me.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.369
Make sure I don't fuck it up.
So what do you think?

14:30.495 --> 14:31.997
- It's not for me.
- Yeah.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.582
- I'm fucking with you.
- Yeah?

14:33.582 --> 14:34.499
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.251
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Congrats.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.173
Yeah, cool.
So, someone from Nike is gonna call you.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.635
Name starts with W. Ends with W. I don't--

14:45.677 --> 14:46.803
- I'll handle it.
- Okay.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.971
- Thank you, Jamie.
- Yeah.

14:57.606 --> 14:58.607
Hey, Jamie.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.442
Yeah?

15:02.236 --> 15:03.445
Wanna grab a beer later?

15:04.488 --> 15:06.240
I thought you said
I couldn't have beer anymore.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.075
Well, you're with me, so you get a pass.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.619
Yeah, decent. I'm in, yeah.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.122
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

15:16.834 --> 15:17.876
So are you two friends now?

15:19.002 --> 15:21.129
- Yeah. Guess so.
- That's wonderful.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.382
Yeah.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.133
Fucking mint, yeah.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.514
- Should I use that pose or that pose?
- Lads. Thank the Lord.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.349
- None of 'em.
- I just signed up for that Bantr.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.433
Should I--

15:33.433 --> 15:36.270
I mean, when your father died,
I was terrified of being alone.

15:36.270 --> 15:39.773
But now I've learned so much
about myself in this last year,

15:39.773 --> 15:41.817
and I've been right all along, you know.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.527
I really am exceptional.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.115
Right.
Mother, you know that Ted isn't dying.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.075
He's just moving back to America.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.329
You say potato, you say potato.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.960
I've been thinking about selling the club.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.090
- I know. Is that crazy?
- No! No, I love it.

16:05.883 --> 16:08.427
Go for it. Take the money and run.

16:08.427 --> 16:09.636
Explore the world.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.140
More importantly, explore yourself.

16:14.308 --> 16:17.019
You know, I had a dream last night
that I was a cabaret singer in Japan.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.103
Shut up.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.731
No, you've given me chills.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.442
I had exactly the same dream.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.153
You were a dentist in Taiwan,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.821
- but--
- Oh, Mother.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.489
Well, potato, potato.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.535
You going to the match on Sunday?

16:34.161 --> 16:36.455
Oh, sausage, I can't. I'm sorry.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.874
I've been wanting to get a tattoo,

16:39.750 --> 16:42.669
so I'm meeting with a specialist
who can remove it if I hate it.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.547
But I did see Tish the other day.

16:46.215 --> 16:49.051
She told me who's gonna win the game.
Do you wanna know?

16:49.760 --> 16:53.013
I have had more than enough of
Tish's bloody predictions

16:53.013 --> 16:55.641
to last me a lifetime,
thank you very much.

16:55.641 --> 17:00.395
But please do tell her that she's a fraud
that preys on people's weaknesses.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.315
That's exactly what she said you'd say.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.483
Anything else, ladies?

17:05.483 --> 17:08.862
I'd just like some peace of mind
for my daughter.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.656
And all of her generation.

17:10.656 --> 17:14.451
Must be awful for 'em,
lying awake at night haunted

17:14.451 --> 17:16.161
by how fucking easy they've had it.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.292
Fucking hell.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.421
We'll just have the bill. Thank you, Mae.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.341
It's been taken care of
by these gentlemen.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.264
We just wanted to thank you
for everything you've done for the club.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.975
Yeah. The love and care you have
for the team is inspiring.

17:38.934 --> 17:40.561
Kind of like the mother we never had.

17:40.561 --> 17:44.064
That's weird. 'Cause I'm like
the mother she's never had.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.984
I guess that makes you like
the grandmother we never had.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.402
No, it doesn't.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.532
Why would you say that?

17:53.532 --> 17:54.950
I was trying to be nice.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.829
Did I tell you? I'm learning to--

18:00.414 --> 18:02.958
What's it called? Skateboard.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.502
Do you mean skateboard?

18:05.502 --> 18:08.589
- Yeah, yeah. Skateboard. Really.
- You any good?

18:09.298 --> 18:10.340
Will be.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.727
So you do laugh.

18:21.727 --> 18:25.272
But you don't do it until page 43?

18:25.272 --> 18:27.024
And it wasn't even a big laugh.

18:27.024 --> 18:30.194
That was more of a loud nose breath.
An exhale.

18:30.194 --> 18:34.656
Hey, Trent. Look, I know folks are divided
on the actual police these days,

18:34.656 --> 18:37.492
but all human beings
are opposed to the laugh police.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.330
Yeah. Yes, sorry.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.291
Yeah.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.503
I just want you to like it.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.216
I'll leave you be.

18:55.886 --> 18:58.013
- Good night, Trent.
- Good night.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.009
Worth the wait.

19:39.972 --> 19:44.101
Whatever happens on Sunday,
I want you to know I'm proud of you.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.437
All the work you've put in this year.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.816
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.988
And thank you for your help too, you know.

19:55.988 --> 19:59.908
For motivating me, encouraging me.

20:01.535 --> 20:04.580
I haven't really had that
from the older men in me life.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.042
Real talk, man. Thank you.

20:16.550 --> 20:20.387
And look, I know you've got
a lot of feelings for Keeley.

20:21.430 --> 20:26.268
I just hope none of that shit ever gets
in the way of our friendship.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.314
Yeah. No, yeah, me too, yeah.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.398
Good.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.151
That's good.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.446
'Cause me and Keeley
started talking again.

20:39.990 --> 20:40.866
Oh, yeah?

20:41.491 --> 20:43.785
Yeah. Just easing into it.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.956
But she is a woman,
so you never know, right?

20:50.834 --> 20:53.462
It's nothing official
between the two of you?

20:55.380 --> 20:56.381
Well--

20:57.341 --> 21:00.260
No, but it's happening.

21:01.345 --> 21:05.015
I wanted you to know
'cause I don't want you to get hurt, so...

21:05.849 --> 21:09.311
I think it's best if you just step aside.

21:13.607 --> 21:14.650
No.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.572
What the fuck do you mean, "no"?

21:21.156 --> 21:25.160
I mean, if the two of you ain't official,
then I ain't steppin' aside.

21:27.079 --> 21:27.913
Why not?

21:27.913 --> 21:32.334
'Cause I know in my heart that me
and Keeley are meant to be together.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.461
Fuck off. You're a child.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.547
You fuck off. You're a hairy old prune.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.925
Don't forget, I was with her first.

21:39.925 --> 21:41.468
Yeah, well, I was with her last.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.637
It's been a year, mate.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.182
It's been a month, mate.

21:59.069 --> 22:04.116
That video of her that got leaked,
she made that for me.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.217
I'm ready to talk about it now.

22:42.988 --> 22:44.531
I've decided to sell the club.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.205
If you go, I go.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.134
There is another option.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.470
We both stay.

23:12.935 --> 23:16.313
I respect that you need
to go home to your son, Ted.

23:17.231 --> 23:22.402
But I just want you to consider
the possibility that this is your home.

23:24.738 --> 23:29.618
Henry can come and live here and go to
one of the best schools in the world

23:29.618 --> 23:34.665
and enjoy the life-changing experience
of being in another country.

23:36.041 --> 23:39.002
Michelle can come here and teach,

23:39.002 --> 23:43.215
get fully qualified
and go home as a department head.

23:48.637 --> 23:52.599
Higgins has said,
if I sell 49% of the team,

23:53.225 --> 23:56.770
I can afford to make you one of
the highest-paid coaches in the league.

24:02.401 --> 24:04.444
I know people will say I'm crazy, but...

24:07.656 --> 24:10.576
I still think I'd be underpaying you
for what you mean to this club.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.128
Would you please stay?

24:27.718 --> 24:30.179
This is the part when you say
you need to sleep on it and I say,

24:30.179 --> 24:31.263
"Oh, yes, of course."

24:31.263 --> 24:33.140
And then we do exactly the same thing tomorrow.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.443
You already know your answer, don't you?

24:48.363 --> 24:50.157
- I do, yeah.
- I know.

24:52.034 --> 24:53.118
I just had to try.

24:57.289 --> 24:58.290
Right.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.418
Well, that's settled then.

25:05.214 --> 25:06.298
Both go.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.055
You know, I was thinking
I should travel abroad.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.893
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> style, right?

25:18.602 --> 25:22.773
Well, more like <i>Drink, Sleep, Fuck</i>.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.167
Fucking hell.

25:43.502 --> 25:44.545
He's fine.

25:50.467 --> 25:53.512
All right.
You gonna tell me what happened?

25:54.888 --> 25:56.306
Did you stop a mugging?

25:58.141 --> 26:00.853
Rescue some puppies
from a burning building?

26:01.562 --> 26:02.771
Do you wanna?

26:02.771 --> 26:04.064
After you.

26:06.984 --> 26:09.236
- We got in a fight about you.
- You what?

26:10.028 --> 26:14.116
We got in a fistfight
over who gets to be with you.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.910
We just thought,
"What are we, Neanderthals?"

26:17.578 --> 26:20.998
Yeah, and we're not.
So we came up with a better idea.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.332
Please don't say it.

26:22.332 --> 26:23.584
You should just pick.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.462
You pick which one of us
you want to end up with.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.883
And then, that's that.

26:30.883 --> 26:32.843
- Bish-bash-bosh.
- Bob's your uncle.

26:32.843 --> 26:34.636
So, I get to choose?

26:40.934 --> 26:42.394
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

26:47.441 --> 26:50.903
- We're fucking idiots.
- Yep, yep, yep.

26:53.989 --> 26:54.990
Are you hungry?

26:55.866 --> 26:58.160
Well, you're still in training,

26:58.160 --> 27:00.329
but you can watch me eat a kebab.

27:03.832 --> 27:04.875
I'm having chicken.

27:22.935 --> 27:24.144
- Hey.
- Oh, my fucking God!

27:24.144 --> 27:25.938
I'm sorry about that.

27:25.938 --> 27:29.691
I was trying to come in soft
like a human cotton ball.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.318
No. God, no, I'm sorry. I'm here late.

27:31.318 --> 27:32.402
It's all right.

27:34.530 --> 27:35.531
Yeah.

27:48.836 --> 27:49.837
Listen, Ted--

27:49.837 --> 27:51.338
I know. It's okay.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.674
No, please, please.
Can you just let me say it?

27:56.093 --> 27:57.094
I'm sorry.

27:58.345 --> 27:59.555
I'm so sorry.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.642
Oh, buddy.

28:10.148 --> 28:11.149
I'm sorry.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.200
You know what's funny?

28:21.743 --> 28:23.036
You only ripped it up once.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.164
I tore that sucker down
and ripped it up two times.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.458
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

28:29.585 --> 28:31.003
So you were already in the clear,
you know?

28:31.003 --> 28:32.212
Okay.

28:33.505 --> 28:34.506
Okay.

28:42.931 --> 28:44.016
But I'll tell ya,

28:45.267 --> 28:46.560
when I look up there...

28:48.729 --> 28:49.771
I still see it.

28:57.112 --> 28:58.363
Is that weird?

28:58.363 --> 29:01.241
No, that's lovely.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.167
Good night, Nate.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.211
Good night, Ted.

29:34.274 --> 29:37.444
<i>AFC Richmond was founded in 1897,</i>

29:37.444 --> 29:40.822
<i>and since then, the team have been
a picture of mediocrity.</i>

29:41.323 --> 29:44.159
<i>They've been up. They've been down.
Mostly down.</i>

29:44.159 --> 29:45.744
<i>And in the club's history,</i>

29:45.744 --> 29:48.914
<i>they've never come close
to what they could achieve today:</i>

29:48.914 --> 29:51.124
<i>a Premier League title.</i>

29:51.124 --> 29:53.377
<i>Fate is not entirely in their hands.</i>

29:53.377 --> 29:56.505
<i>Their adversaries
in Manchester have the final say.</i>

29:56.505 --> 29:57.923
<i>But the Richmond faithful are here</i>

29:57.923 --> 30:01.009
<i>to applaud their team
for what they've already accomplished</i>

30:01.009 --> 30:02.803
<i>and see if the miraculous season...</i>

30:02.803 --> 30:04.847
- AFC Richmond.
- <i>...can become transcendent.</i>

30:04.847 --> 30:08.141
Hello. There should be a ticket
waiting for me under the name...

30:09.059 --> 30:10.227
"Wynonna Judd."

30:12.104 --> 30:13.105
Thanks.

30:13.647 --> 30:14.648
Thank you.

30:15.190 --> 30:18.318
- You see the way that guy stared at me?
- Absolute psychopath.

30:20.028 --> 30:21.446
We feeling good, lads? Feeling good?

30:21.446 --> 30:23.115
- I think we're gonna win it.
- Me too.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.324
Then what?

30:24.324 --> 30:26.910
Richmond win the League,
what do we have left to strive for?

30:27.578 --> 30:28.662
To dream for?

30:28.662 --> 30:31.373
Making a real connection with someone
and starting a family?

30:33.458 --> 30:34.459
Yeah.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.462
- Boring.
- Yeah.

30:37.462 --> 30:39.506
<i>...a humiliating relegation.</i>

30:39.506 --> 30:41.884
<i>It has really been a mad season, Arlo.</i>

30:41.884 --> 30:44.136
I'm actually nervous. Are you nervous?

30:44.136 --> 30:45.762
Nah, Dad's got this.

30:45.762 --> 30:46.889
All right, all right.

30:46.889 --> 30:49.516
Who's ready to spend the next two hours
of their lives watching this game

30:49.516 --> 30:52.769
until it eventually ends up
in an exciting 0-0 tie?

30:57.024 --> 31:01.069
<i>Not long ago, Lasso was looking up
from the doghouse of the Dogtrack.</i>

31:01.069 --> 31:05.115
<i>Now he's looking down from
the highest heights of English football.</i>

31:05.115 --> 31:06.700
It don't make sense!

31:06.700 --> 31:08.202
Two years ago, we played so bad,

31:08.202 --> 31:10.412
we had to drop down
from the Premier League

31:10.412 --> 31:12.164
to a lower league that was called...

31:12.164 --> 31:13.290
The Championship.

31:13.290 --> 31:14.416
See, that don't make sense.

31:14.416 --> 31:18.086
Now, this year we played so well,
we qualified to get into another league

31:18.086 --> 31:19.922
- and that one's called...
- The Champions League.

31:19.922 --> 31:22.132
Entirely different league,
pretty much the same name though.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.217
That don't make sense.

31:23.217 --> 31:26.345
And now y'all are tellin' me that
to get into the "Champions League,"

31:26.345 --> 31:27.846
you can finish as low as...

31:27.846 --> 31:29.223
Fourth place.

31:29.223 --> 31:32.226
That don't make no sense. Why?

31:34.686 --> 31:35.812
Money.

31:36.396 --> 31:37.439
Okay, see, now that makes sense.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.566
- Okay. That's it.
- Thank you.

31:40.359 --> 31:41.860
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up, Nate?

31:41.860 --> 31:43.987
Hi. Yeah, sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt and all that.

31:43.987 --> 31:46.365
I just wanted to wish you all good luck.

31:47.366 --> 31:50.369
To wish you two good luck
for the last time.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.872
Last time this season. It's not
the last time you ever have good luck.

31:54.665 --> 31:56.583
No need for it
to become a cautionary tale.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.585
I'm not trying to cast a spell
or anything.

31:58.585 --> 32:00.712
Yeah, no. I get it, Nate. Thank you.

32:00.712 --> 32:01.839
Thanks, man.

32:01.839 --> 32:03.757
Thank you. Well...

32:04.466 --> 32:06.009
Well, this feels familiar.

32:07.594 --> 32:09.054
Oh, yeah.

32:11.098 --> 32:14.226
Why don't I step out
and let you guys have a proper reunion?

32:14.893 --> 32:17.020
You stay put, Trenthouse Magazine.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.564
You're part of the squad now.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.234
- Yep. You're stuck with us, buddy.
- Thank you.

32:23.652 --> 32:25.153
Can I be a Diamond Dog?

32:33.912 --> 32:37.124
Okay, hold on one second here.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:42.379 --> 32:43.797
What the fuck are you doing?

32:44.756 --> 32:47.801
I assume we're all looking for cameras
'cause we think we're on a prank show.

32:47.801 --> 32:49.970
- Yeah, that's where I'm at.
- Yeah.

32:49.970 --> 32:51.597
I'm not fucking around here.

32:55.934 --> 32:57.853
Okay. Diamond Dogs, mount up. Let's go.

33:06.153 --> 33:07.404
Okay. Mr. Roy Kent.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.698
You know, bark away. Please.

33:11.283 --> 33:12.576
For the past year,

33:13.493 --> 33:18.332
I've busted my fucking ass
trying to change.

33:20.250 --> 33:23.045
But apparently,
I haven't done fucking shit 'cause...

33:25.589 --> 33:27.132
I'm still me.

33:32.387 --> 33:35.182
Wait. Did you wanna be someone else?

33:35.182 --> 33:36.266
Yeah.

33:37.476 --> 33:38.560
Someone better.

33:43.065 --> 33:44.316
Can people change?

33:56.286 --> 33:58.330
I don't think we change per se,

33:58.330 --> 34:02.417
as much as we just learn to accept
who we've always been, you know?

34:04.628 --> 34:06.922
No. I think people can change.

34:06.922 --> 34:07.923
They can.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.928
You know, sometimes for the worse
and sometimes for the better.

34:17.014 --> 34:20.018
Not me. I'm still the same fucking idiot
I've always been.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.688
Agree to disagree, big guy.

34:22.688 --> 34:24.188
I mean, come on, man.

34:24.188 --> 34:27.359
You just piped up out of nowhere
and finally asked to become a Diamond Dog.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.402
Pretty big change, if you ask me.

34:29.402 --> 34:30.862
- Right, fellas?
- Yep.

34:31.822 --> 34:33.824
Change isn't about trying to be perfect.

34:34.533 --> 34:37.244
Perfection sucks. Perfect is boring.

34:37.244 --> 34:39.121
I mean, except <i>Shawshank</i>.
That's not boring.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.455
- Yep.
- Well, that's true.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.875
Yeah. I mean, there are perfect films.
<i>Back to the Future.</i>

34:42.875 --> 34:44.501
- <i>Jaws.</i>
- <i>Jaws</i>. Yeah.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.879
- I would say Trent's hair is perfect.
- Oh, God, yeah.

34:46.879 --> 34:48.505
- Thank you.
- Not at all boring.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.175
Sure. You know, attributes.
Grace Kelly's eyes.

34:51.175 --> 34:54.136
- The other side of the pillow.
- That is absolutely perfect.

34:54.136 --> 34:55.512
There are perfect analogies.

34:55.512 --> 34:58.307
- Jacket potato, cheese and beans.
- That sounds perfectly yummy. Yeah.

34:58.307 --> 35:00.267
Perfect foods. Spaghetti Bolognese.

35:00.267 --> 35:02.603
- Billy Joel's <i>The Stranger</i> album.
- Yep, no, that's perfect.

35:02.603 --> 35:04.396
Yes! There are perfect works of art.

35:04.396 --> 35:06.607
There-- Perfection is all around us,
everywhere we look.

35:06.607 --> 35:07.733
The mighty redwood.

35:07.733 --> 35:09.818
But I was talking
about perfection in people.

35:10.652 --> 35:12.946
- Sure. Yeah. No, I get you.
- Oh, right. Sure.

35:12.946 --> 35:15.449
Human beings are
never gonna be perfect, Roy.

35:15.449 --> 35:20.996
The best we can do is to keep asking
for help and accepting it when you can.

35:21.663 --> 35:25.167
And if you keep on doing that,
you'll always be moving towards better.

35:30.881 --> 35:32.591
Add that right there
to our list of perfect stuff.

35:34.384 --> 35:36.386
- Ding, ding, ding.
- All right.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.056
Thank you.

35:46.146 --> 35:47.481
Anyone else wanna go?

35:49.733 --> 35:50.776
I've got a girlfriend.

35:53.987 --> 35:55.781
Her name is Jade,
and she actually is perfect.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.085
- George.
- Rupert.

36:08.752 --> 36:09.753
You guys ready?

36:09.753 --> 36:12.256
Don't you worry,
I won't let you lose to your ex-wife.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.342
I mean, your first ex-wife.

36:15.926 --> 36:19.221
I mean, your previous, most recent ex-wi--

36:19.221 --> 36:21.390
- You know what I mean.
- Just beat them.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.894
Win.

36:26.895 --> 36:27.896
Yes, boss.

36:28.814 --> 36:31.108
<i>We have to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.</i>

36:31.108 --> 36:34.361
<i>Unsavory allegations of sexual impropriety</i>

36:34.361 --> 36:37.364
<i>have Rupert Mannion on the brink
of losing his club.</i>

36:37.364 --> 36:41.451
<i>But the truth is, a win today puts
the Hammers into the Champions League,</i>

36:41.451 --> 36:43.287
<i>a feather in Mannion's cap</i>

36:43.287 --> 36:45.873
<i>that could keep him in power
a little bit longer.</i>

36:50.043 --> 36:53.463
So, this is where they've been hiding
all the beautiful people.

36:55.883 --> 36:56.842
Hello, Rupert.

36:58.594 --> 36:59.595
Rebecca.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.557
- Hi, Sassy.
- Hiya.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.100
Aren't you the lucky man.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.770
Whatever happens today,
a team you love wins.

37:13.358 --> 37:15.861
Heard the news. Ouch.

37:16.778 --> 37:19.323
Looks like you're gonna lose another team.

37:19.323 --> 37:21.116
My God, you get through them like wives.

37:21.825 --> 37:22.993
Or mistresses.

37:22.993 --> 37:25.245
Or, I'm assuming,
tubes of hemorrhoid cream.

37:27.372 --> 37:29.958
But in all seriousness,
I do wish you the best...

37:31.376 --> 37:33.837
'cause you are the fucking worst.

37:37.799 --> 37:38.800
Come on, Richmond!

37:38.800 --> 37:40.761
- Yes!
- Yeah!

37:43.430 --> 37:45.057
You're in good spirits, aren't you?

37:46.099 --> 37:48.101
Anything behind that great mood?

37:48.101 --> 37:50.896
Something that might affect
where I'll work next year?

37:50.896 --> 37:52.856
- After the match, Leslie.
- Right.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.651
Chill. Okay.

37:55.651 --> 37:57.778
Say, Barbara, you a football fan?

37:58.737 --> 38:00.030
I prefer rugby.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.823
There's just more grown men

38:01.823 --> 38:04.284
throwing other grown men
into the air like children.

38:04.284 --> 38:06.161
- And blood.
- Yeah.

38:06.161 --> 38:07.329
Which is nice.

38:10.123 --> 38:12.876
One more, boys. Come on. One more.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.213
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.

38:16.213 --> 38:18.215
We've just been sent
a care package from Zava.

38:19.508 --> 38:22.427
No. Thank you, but no.
I will not let him hurt me again.

38:22.427 --> 38:23.387
It's T-shirts.

38:23.387 --> 38:24.638
Can I have two, please?

38:27.349 --> 38:28.350
There's a card.

38:28.350 --> 38:29.685
"My brothers.

38:30.769 --> 38:32.479
Good luck against West Ham.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.815
Please enjoy the T-shirts
and this avocado from my farm.

38:34.815 --> 38:38.986
Never forget,
I am always inside you. Zava."

38:38.986 --> 38:41.071
What, he sent us one avocado?

38:43.907 --> 38:45.617
That's a huge avocado.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.286
Holy guacamole.

38:47.286 --> 38:48.745
Show me that, bro.

38:52.249 --> 38:53.250
Fucking hell.

38:59.923 --> 39:00.924
Hey, Dani.

39:00.924 --> 39:03.093
Van Damme. I also got you a gift,

39:03.093 --> 39:06.180
as a way to say I am sorry
for destroying your face.

39:23.906 --> 39:26.283
- How do I look?
- Wonderful.

39:26.283 --> 39:28.785
Van Damme. You look like a superhero.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.955
Yeah? Yeah?

39:35.751 --> 39:36.960
<i>Merci, frère.</i>

39:36.960 --> 39:38.378
<i>De nada, mi amigo.</i>

39:40.672 --> 39:42.382
Y'all ready? Okay? Okay.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.885
All right, fellas. Hey, let's listen up.

39:45.761 --> 39:47.971
Hey. Nice mask, Van Damme.

39:48.555 --> 39:51.642
Thanks, Coach, but actually
from now on you can call me Zorro.

39:52.518 --> 39:53.477
You got it, Zoreaux.

39:53.477 --> 39:55.812
No, it's pronounced "Zorro."

39:57.523 --> 40:00.609
'Cause of the mask.
I got you. Nice one. Okay.

40:01.193 --> 40:04.947
Well, fellas, if you're looking for
a pep talk from me, you're in trouble.

40:04.947 --> 40:09.326
'Cause I'm like Michael Flatley
at 11:59 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day,

40:09.326 --> 40:11.453
I'm tapped out. You know what I mean?

40:12.329 --> 40:14.039
Luckily, though, I asked Coach Beard here

40:14.039 --> 40:17.334
to make y'all a little something something
to help inspire and motivate y'all

40:17.334 --> 40:19.086
for our final match together, all right?

40:19.086 --> 40:21.338
- Coach, let her rip.
- Gather up!

41:08.719 --> 41:09.720
<i>Come on, bro.</i>

41:12.014 --> 41:14.224
- <i>The barber.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

41:21.732 --> 41:23.400
<i>Christmas!</i>

41:23.400 --> 41:26.236
<i>We are going up. Yeah, we are going up.</i>

41:26.778 --> 41:29.698
<i>We are going up. Yeah, we are going up.</i>

41:44.004 --> 41:45.005
Oh, shit.

41:46.632 --> 41:49.510
<i>As a player, you know
the match starts before the whistle.</i>

41:49.510 --> 41:53.096
<i>During the lineups, you need to show
your opponent you're ready for the fight.</i>

41:53.096 --> 41:55.057
<i>You've got the eye of the tiger.</i>

41:55.057 --> 41:57.184
<i>Richmond appear to be crying, Chris.</i>

41:57.184 --> 41:58.644
<i>Interesting strategy.</i>

41:58.644 --> 42:00.687
<i>Did you ever cry before a game?</i>

42:00.687 --> 42:03.357
<i>Only during and after. Never before.</i>

42:03.357 --> 42:05.984
<i>Before the match is reserved
for anxious vomiting.</i>

42:06.527 --> 42:10.614
<i>I'm getting emotional myself.
Chris, would you mind if I wept?</i>

42:10.614 --> 42:13.408
<i>Not at all, Arlo.
Would you mind if I vomited?</i>

42:14.326 --> 42:16.370
Think we might've blew it
with the video, Coach.

42:16.370 --> 42:19.039
I couldn't disagree more.
Ain't that right, Roy?

42:19.831 --> 42:22.584
You fucking smashed it.

42:27.714 --> 42:31.301
<i>We've played a quarter of an hour
and remained deadlocked.</i>

42:31.301 --> 42:32.511
<i>West Ham with a corner.</i>

42:33.470 --> 42:35.055
<i>A lovely ball there.</i>

42:35.055 --> 42:36.640
<i>Armando shoots,</i>

42:36.640 --> 42:38.517
<i>but it's saved by Van Damme.</i>

42:38.517 --> 42:39.852
That's all right.

42:39.852 --> 42:41.728
I hear he wants to be called Zorro now.

42:41.728 --> 42:43.313
Well, it's about time.

42:44.982 --> 42:46.733
<i>Richmond seem to have settled down.</i>

42:46.733 --> 42:50.654
<i>They're on the attack, ticking along
with the precision of a Swiss clock,</i>

42:50.654 --> 42:53.156
<i>with Jamie Tartt as its central cog.</i>

42:53.782 --> 42:54.992
Tiki-taka.

42:54.992 --> 42:56.827
Tiki-fucking-tedious.

43:03.083 --> 43:07.421
<i>Trickery from Tartt.
The outside of his boot to Rojas.</i>

43:08.172 --> 43:09.506
- <i>So close.</i>
- Shit!

43:10.549 --> 43:11.466
Shit.

43:11.466 --> 43:12.593
Oh, shoot.

43:12.593 --> 43:13.969
Well, something happened.

43:15.846 --> 43:18.765
<i>Jamie Tartt is going to carve
West Ham up if they keep letting him.</i>

43:19.349 --> 43:24.271
Come on, Richmond! Come on, Richmond!

43:24.271 --> 43:27.357
That's all right, fellas.
Keep calm and get fired up.

43:27.357 --> 43:28.442
Here we go, Greyhounds!

43:29.109 --> 43:31.195
<i>West Ham looking dangerous here, Arlo.</i>

43:32.946 --> 43:34.740
- <i>And Quizet scores...</i>
- No!

43:34.740 --> 43:36.658
<i>- ...past a diving Zorro.</i>
- Goddamn it!

43:38.202 --> 43:40.245
It's okay. It's okay.

43:43.165 --> 43:44.541
- Come on, Richmond!
- Richmond!

43:44.541 --> 43:46.418
Come on, Richmond!

43:46.418 --> 43:49.505
<i>Bad moment for the keeper,
but that mask is cool as hell.</i>

43:49.505 --> 43:51.173
<i>He's got that going for him, Chris.</i>

43:51.173 --> 43:53.175
That's okay, fellas. Let's go!

43:55.969 --> 43:59.598
<i>West Ham are gaining ground.
Richmond are playing in reverse.</i>

44:01.391 --> 44:03.435
Come on, boys!

44:07.189 --> 44:08.190
Hey, Nate.

44:08.690 --> 44:10.275
Yeah.

44:10.275 --> 44:11.652
Is that what I think it is?

44:11.652 --> 44:13.195
Yep. Man City just scored.

44:13.779 --> 44:16.990
<i>In Manchester, City have
taken the lead against Liverpool.</i>

44:16.990 --> 44:18.659
It's okay. All right. Okay.

44:18.659 --> 44:21.745
<i>Here in West London,
the Hammers are on the attack.</i>

44:25.040 --> 44:27.960
<i>Richmond absolutely cannot
concede here, Arlo.</i>

44:28.627 --> 44:29.670
<i>And they've conceded!</i>

44:29.670 --> 44:30.629
No!

44:30.629 --> 44:34.424
<i>West Ham extend their lead.
Richmond's dreams are in tatters.</i>

44:39.471 --> 44:41.098
Shit! Don't say "shit."

44:46.687 --> 44:51.525
<i>And at the half, it's West Ham 2,
Richmond's title hopes 0.</i>

44:53.318 --> 44:56.238
<i>Chris Powell, how would you
sum up the first half?</i>

44:56.238 --> 45:00.534
Richmond's Cinderella story seems
to be turning into a big, fat pumpkin.

45:08.834 --> 45:11.086
- Just go.
- All right.

45:15.841 --> 45:18.010
Shut your butts and sit your mouths down!

45:20.888 --> 45:22.222
You know what I meant.

45:25.934 --> 45:26.935
Thanks, Coach.

45:31.148 --> 45:34.151
Well, fellas, we got our work
cut out for us in the second half.

45:34.151 --> 45:36.904
But you know,
I'll get to all that in a minute.

45:36.904 --> 45:41.074
No, right now, all I wanna do
is let you gentlemen know

45:41.074 --> 45:44.161
what an absolute honor
it's been to be your coach.

45:46.538 --> 45:48.665
Getting to work with y'all
these last three years

45:48.665 --> 45:51.084
has truly been one of
the greatest experiences of my life.

45:52.586 --> 45:55.047
I've loved getting to know
each and every single one of you.

45:56.548 --> 45:59.510
Learning all about the men you were

45:59.510 --> 46:03.680
and getting a front-row seat
to see the men you all have become.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.977
And I wanna thank you
for your patience with me.

46:08.977 --> 46:11.980
You know, when I showed up here,
I didn't know one thing about soccer.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.440
But now--

46:13.440 --> 46:15.734
Well, now I know at least one thing
about football.

46:19.947 --> 46:22.908
I'm just so gosh damn proud to be
a part of this team. You know?

46:24.910 --> 46:26.370
And I love you guys.

46:34.169 --> 46:35.295
I'm gonna miss y'all.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.635
Now, regarding this second half...

46:44.346 --> 46:46.890
Yeah, I don't know what's gonna happen.
You know what I mean?

46:46.890 --> 46:48.308
No one does.

46:48.308 --> 46:50.519
Sports would be a lot less fun if we did.
You know?

46:51.562 --> 46:53.730
And you all would probably
make a lot less money, so-- You know?

46:55.941 --> 46:58.777
We don't wanna know the future.
No, no, we wanna be here right now.

46:59.611 --> 47:01.613
And look,
I know we're down a couple goals.

47:01.613 --> 47:04.366
But I'm telling you, man,

47:05.742 --> 47:10.122
if y'all play hard, play smart,
play together and just, you know...

47:20.215 --> 47:21.550
Just do what y'all do,

47:22.676 --> 47:26.305
and we'll go out with the peace of mind
knowing we did our best. Right?

47:26.889 --> 47:29.558
- That we tried. Yeah?
- Yes, Coach.

47:29.558 --> 47:30.809
All right.

47:32.603 --> 47:34.146
Anybody else have something to say?

47:38.233 --> 47:40.235
- Coach.
- Yeah, Sam, what you got?

49:09.324 --> 49:11.076
Yeah, let's go. Let's do it.

49:13.996 --> 49:16.415
That's my bit. I know where that went.

49:25.507 --> 49:27.050
This one goes here.

49:30.053 --> 49:32.306
- Hold on. No, no.
- Just right there.

49:33.348 --> 49:34.349
There you go.

49:44.401 --> 49:48.155
And there it is. Number four. Yeah?

49:54.578 --> 49:55.704
All right, let's bring it in.

50:06.924 --> 50:10.219
I know folks like to say,
"There's no place like home."

50:11.678 --> 50:13.639
That's true. You know.

50:18.352 --> 50:22.272
Man, there ain't a whole lot
of places like AFC Richmond either.

50:25.400 --> 50:26.318
Captain?

50:28.737 --> 50:32.199
- Richmond on three. One, two, three...
- Richmond!

50:35.577 --> 50:37.829
<i>The Greyhounds have come out
for the second half</i>

50:37.829 --> 50:41.291
<i>looking like the team
we've seen win 16 matches in a row.</i>

50:41.291 --> 50:44.336
<i>Playing a style of football
that is as fun to watch</i>

50:44.336 --> 50:45.796
<i>as it is to play.</i>

50:45.796 --> 50:48.048
<i>Well, it makes me wish
I was down there right now, Arlo.</i>

50:48.048 --> 50:51.176
Not playing, because I'm old
and likely to get hurt.

50:52.261 --> 50:53.887
<i>Audacious from Tartt.</i>

50:55.639 --> 50:57.933
<i>Rojas cuts inside. He shoots!</i>

50:58.559 --> 50:59.768
<i>Off the post!</i>

51:01.436 --> 51:02.855
<i>Obisanya,</i>

51:02.855 --> 51:04.565
<i>off the woodwork again!</i>

51:04.565 --> 51:06.108
No, no, no!

51:06.108 --> 51:07.025
<i>Hughes!</i>

51:08.068 --> 51:09.945
<i>Another miss!</i>

51:13.574 --> 51:16.326
<i>And Tartt finally puts it away</i>

51:16.326 --> 51:19.371
<i>in the 51st minute,
and Richmond have a lifeline!</i>

51:19.371 --> 51:20.706
Yes! Get in!

51:20.706 --> 51:23.083
Yeah, Jamie Tartt!

51:23.083 --> 51:25.043
<i>The entire front four were involved.</i>

51:25.043 --> 51:27.671
<i>- And Tartt put it home.</i>
- <i>Jamie Tartt, dun-dun-du-dun-un</i>

51:27.671 --> 51:29.798
<i>This feels like trouble
for West Ham, Arlo.</i>

51:29.798 --> 51:33.177
<i>The one thing they cannot afford to do
is let Jamie Tartt get going.</i>

51:33.177 --> 51:36.180
For fuck's sake, George, do something.
Mark him.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.556
Get in there.

51:39.683 --> 51:41.310
<i>And here come Richmond again!</i>

51:41.310 --> 51:43.312
<i>Tartt loses his marker.</i>

51:43.979 --> 51:45.314
Referee!

51:46.481 --> 51:48.192
And it's a penalty!

51:48.192 --> 51:50.360
<i>Richmond have been relentless this half.</i>

51:50.360 --> 51:52.613
<i>Now, Tartt wins them a chance to equalize.</i>

51:52.613 --> 51:54.531
Okay. Here we go.

51:55.574 --> 51:57.367
<i>That was professional from Tartt.</i>

51:57.367 --> 51:59.870
<i>Not quite a dive,
but not much of a foul either.</i>

52:01.246 --> 52:04.208
Yes, Jamie Tartt, you fucking genius!

52:06.668 --> 52:07.669
Hey.

52:09.129 --> 52:10.547
Knock it in, <i>muchacho</i>.

52:11.757 --> 52:12.758
Sure.

52:18.722 --> 52:20.057
Crush it, <i>Capitan</i>.

52:20.057 --> 52:21.600
What the fuck, bruv?

52:21.600 --> 52:23.018
Okay.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.604
Just take it, mate.

52:25.604 --> 52:27.481
- Bruv.
- It'll be fun.

52:29.816 --> 52:30.776
<i>El</i> Isaac.

52:31.860 --> 52:33.320
<i>Is McAdoo stepping up?</i>

52:33.320 --> 52:34.613
Oh, shit.

52:34.613 --> 52:35.822
<i>Wait, what?</i>

52:35.822 --> 52:37.908
McAdoo to take the penalty?

52:37.908 --> 52:39.785
I wouldn't trust him to take an aspirin.

52:46.792 --> 52:50.003
<i>Isaac McAdoo has never taken a penalty</i>

52:50.003 --> 52:51.797
<i>in his entire career.</i>

52:51.797 --> 52:55.634
<i>- This is madness from 18 yards.</i>
- Come on, man. You got this, bro.

53:02.307 --> 53:04.434
- Let's go!
- Shit.

53:04.434 --> 53:06.103
Okay, gents, outside the area, please.

53:18.115 --> 53:19.616
It's like he's shooting a free throw
with his feet.

53:20.701 --> 53:25.038
<i>This is McAdoo's moment.
If he scores here, the comeback is on.</i>

53:26.123 --> 53:28.959
<i>It's gone over the bar
and into the stands!</i>

53:35.716 --> 53:37.342
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

53:37.342 --> 53:40.637
<i>Mike Dean wants a closer look
at something.</i>

53:41.889 --> 53:42.848
- What?
- Wait.

53:54.359 --> 53:56.153
<i>Mike Dean's calling it a goal.</i>

53:56.153 --> 53:57.988
- <i>How is it possible?</i>
- What?

53:59.156 --> 54:00.657
<i>Did McAdoo just hit the ball</i>

54:00.657 --> 54:03.327
- <i>through the bloody net?</i>
- Oh, fuck!

54:03.327 --> 54:04.912
<i>I think he did, Chris.</i>

54:06.663 --> 54:09.458
<i>We've never seen anything like this,</i>

54:09.458 --> 54:11.502
<i>and the score is 2-2.</i>

54:13.128 --> 54:14.588
2-2.

54:15.088 --> 54:18.884
<i>West Ham are furious.
And you can't really blame them.</i>

54:18.884 --> 54:21.220
<i>This is unprecedented.</i>

54:21.220 --> 54:22.679
<i>What just happened?</i>

54:22.679 --> 54:25.015
<i>We need to take another look
at that penalty, Arlo.</i>

54:25.015 --> 54:28.227
<i>And look, he cannons the ball
through the net! And--</i>

54:28.227 --> 54:30.521
<i>Oh, goodness me. I hope that fan's okay.</i>

54:32.105 --> 54:34.024
Come on, Richmond!

54:37.361 --> 54:39.404
- Oh, my God. It's him.
- That is a lot of blood.

54:39.404 --> 54:40.489
Yes!

54:44.284 --> 54:45.285
Finally.

54:48.205 --> 54:51.041
<i>And as a result
of McAdoo's superhuman foot,</i>

54:51.041 --> 54:54.628
<i>we'll have a bit of a stoppage as
the grounds crew race to replace the net.</i>

55:05.597 --> 55:06.598
Where's he going?

55:14.898 --> 55:17.109
Huddle. Huddle. Come on.

55:17.109 --> 55:21.280
<i>Hang on, Rupert Mannion is out on
the pitch and he's headed to the dugout!</i>

55:21.280 --> 55:22.948
- ...going right on the--
- Oi.

55:22.948 --> 55:25.409
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

55:25.409 --> 55:27.369
What are you talking about?

55:27.369 --> 55:31.206
Tartt is out there doing
whatever he fucking wants.

55:31.206 --> 55:33.292
Yeah. But I've got two players
on him already.

55:33.292 --> 55:34.751
Take him out.

55:35.669 --> 55:36.753
Are you joking?

55:36.753 --> 55:38.338
Get rid of him.

55:38.338 --> 55:41.717
<i>This is remarkable.
Rupert Mannion remonstrating</i>

55:41.717 --> 55:43.927
<i>with his own manager on the pitch.</i>

55:43.927 --> 55:45.637
- <i>You don't see this very often.</i>
- What's he doing?

55:45.637 --> 55:47.973
<i>Well, not since the invention
of telephones at least.</i>

55:48.682 --> 55:52.311
- I'm not playing the game like that.
- You do what I say or you are done.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.605
Fuck off.

55:54.605 --> 55:56.481
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

55:56.481 --> 55:58.942
<i>Ugly scenes at Nelson Road.</i>

55:58.942 --> 56:00.819
<i>Rupert Mannion's nuts.</i>

56:00.819 --> 56:03.238
- <i>And George Cartrick's.</i>
- <i>Damn it, Chris.</i>

56:03.238 --> 56:05.824
Oi, ref, there's three balls on the field!

56:06.825 --> 56:08.118
What?

56:12.581 --> 56:13.999
Get up.

56:17.419 --> 56:18.795
Get up!

56:21.256 --> 56:23.300
Okay, gents. Let's go, please. We're back.

56:24.468 --> 56:26.345
George. Put 'em away.

56:26.345 --> 56:27.513
Oh, yeah.

56:38.398 --> 56:40.150
Right. Come on, lads. Get out there.

56:41.401 --> 56:46.073
Come on! You can take these.
You've got more heart.

56:46.073 --> 56:48.534
That's what I wanna see. More passion.

56:49.034 --> 56:52.246
O'Neill, keep the midfield tight. Come on!

56:52.246 --> 56:53.664
Hearts of lions, lads!

56:54.289 --> 56:55.582
Hearts of lions!

56:58.544 --> 56:59.962
Wanker!

56:59.962 --> 57:02.798
- Wanker!
- Wanker! Wanker!

57:02.798 --> 57:05.843
Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!

57:10.931 --> 57:12.057
Wanker!

57:13.392 --> 57:17.229
Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!

57:28.657 --> 57:30.409
<i>And the game goes on.</i>

57:30.409 --> 57:32.786
<i>Presumably without Rupert Mannion.</i>

57:39.501 --> 57:42.963
<i>Ever since the match resumed,
West Ham have had all the momentum.</i>

57:42.963 --> 57:46.341
<i>They're pinging this around,
and Richmond can't get the ball off them.</i>

57:48.135 --> 57:50.345
<i>A lob into the box.</i>

57:50.345 --> 57:51.889
<i>Zoreaux knocks it.</i>

57:51.889 --> 57:52.806
Oh, no.

57:53.640 --> 57:56.977
<i>The Hammers pounce. Back into the mixer.</i>

57:58.061 --> 57:59.855
<i>And it's 3-2!</i>

57:59.855 --> 58:03.108
<i>Heaven for the Hammers.
Heartbreak for the home side.</i>

58:06.195 --> 58:07.738
What the fuck are you laughing at?

58:07.738 --> 58:09.656
- Fourteen was offside.
- What?

58:10.991 --> 58:12.951
<i>VAR are checking the replay.</i>

58:14.620 --> 58:15.704
Offside.

58:15.704 --> 58:17.372
- <i>The goal's been disallowed.</i>
- Boom.

58:17.372 --> 58:21.793
<i>A stay of execution for Richmond
as West Ham are called for offside.</i>

58:24.588 --> 58:25.589
Thank you.

58:29.134 --> 58:31.803
- It's not counterfeit.
- Not a reflection on you.

58:33.639 --> 58:37.476
One minute of added time remaining
in Richmond's miracle season.

58:37.476 --> 58:38.519
Come on. Put your foot in.

58:38.519 --> 58:41.563
<i>The Greyhounds are running
out of time and ideas.</i>

58:41.563 --> 58:44.858
- Come on.
- <i>Do they have one miracle left?</i>

58:47.027 --> 58:49.154
<i>Tartt, completely boxed in.</i>

58:49.154 --> 58:51.698
<i>He finds Montlaur bearing down on goal.</i>

58:52.616 --> 58:53.992
<i>Montlaur is brought down.</i>

58:53.992 --> 58:56.745
<i>And Richmond have a free kick
in a dangerous position.</i>

58:57.704 --> 58:58.539
Come on.

59:02.709 --> 59:04.711
- Come on.
- Come on.

59:04.711 --> 59:08.173
<i>This could be useful.
What can Richmond order up here?</i>

59:08.173 --> 59:11.093
- Okay. Come on. Talk to me, geese.
- Lasso Special.

59:11.093 --> 59:13.262
We're too close for that. Loki's Toboggan?

59:13.262 --> 59:15.597
That's a long-ass toboggan ride.
Upside-Down Taxicab.

59:15.597 --> 59:17.599
- It's tough without Cockburn.
- Wait. Hold on.

59:17.599 --> 59:20.435
Hey, Nate. Nate, come here.
Come on. Hurry up. Come on.

59:20.435 --> 59:21.770
Yeah, of course.

59:21.770 --> 59:24.648
- Hey, fellas! Hey!
- I don't know what--

59:24.648 --> 59:28.902
<i>Time is running out.
What can the Greyhounds conjure here?</i>

59:31.446 --> 59:32.447
Here, hold that.

59:32.447 --> 59:33.949
It's an Oscar!

59:33.949 --> 59:36.702
It's heavy. It's a little heavy.
There you go. Yeah.

59:37.411 --> 59:38.412
Or the ESPY.

59:41.081 --> 59:43.333
All right. Here we go. Give me that. Okay.

59:43.333 --> 59:45.419
- You know what you're doing?

59:45.419 --> 59:46.879
- Yeah.
- I'm good. Yeah.

59:50.924 --> 59:53.218
<i>It all comes down to this.</i>

59:54.428 --> 59:56.180
<i>Obisanya lays it off to Dixon.</i>

59:56.180 --> 59:57.764
Come on, come on.

59:59.516 --> 01:00:02.019
<i>Dixon switches the play to Bumbercatch.</i>

01:00:04.354 --> 01:00:06.356
<i>Tartt makes his run into the box.</i>

01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:09.067
Yeah! Pass me the ball.
Me, me! I want the ball!

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.194
Pass me the ball, please.

01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:12.196
<i>Obisanya's unmarked.</i>

01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:17.951
<i>A beautiful ball in.</i>

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:18.911
Barbecue sauce.

01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:28.128
<i>Richmond have done it!
Oh, my God, the Greyhounds have done it!</i>

01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:34.259
Yeah! Go, Dad!

01:00:35.594 --> 01:00:38.430
Yes! Yeah!

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:41.558
<i>Nelson Road is in rapture!</i>

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:48.815
- You used my play! You used my play!
- Yeah, I did! Yeah!

01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:53.028
Come on. Bring it-- Bring.

01:01:01.828 --> 01:01:04.081
<i>Mike Dean blows for full time.</i>

01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:06.750
Yeah!

01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:09.670
Thank you, good game.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.130
<i>And the fans are storming onto the pitch!</i>

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.675
<i>And you simply cannot blame them!</i>

01:01:21.014 --> 01:01:22.015
We won.

01:01:35.153 --> 01:01:36.572
Come on.

01:01:42.202 --> 01:01:44.121
Look what you did, Rebecca!

01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.248
- Go, Richmond!
- Look what you did!

01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:49.126
- I didn't do it.
- Yes, you fucking did!

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:53.463
<i>There's a fun sight.
Ted Lasso celebrating with his team.</i>

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:57.342
<i>I never know how to react when a white guy
does the running man in front of everyone.</i>

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.098
<i>Well, what a game, Arlo.</i>

01:02:03.098 --> 01:02:05.100
<i>Well, Richmond have done all they can,</i>

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.561
<i>so it's time to head over
to the Etihad Stadium</i>

01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:10.731
<i>to see the fate
of the Premier League title.</i>

01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.091
- Ready?
- Just these two, please.

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:40.177
- <i>...flight 822 to Kansas City.</i>
- Sure.

01:02:42.513 --> 01:02:44.181
- All right. Appreciate you.
- Thank you.

01:02:51.772 --> 01:02:53.941
- Are you Ted Lasso?
- Yeah. I'm one of them.

01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:56.485
Oh, mate, sucks about
Richmond coming in second.

01:02:56.485 --> 01:02:58.904
- Man City are just too good, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:02.115
- Are you heading home for a cheeky visit?
- I'm heading home for good, actually.

01:03:02.115 --> 01:03:05.702
That's stupid.
Should have stayed, crushed it. Legend.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.913
Just a bit unlucky at the end.

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:10.874
- Can I get an ussie?
- Yeah, sure.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:11.875
Sick.

01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:19.925
- Wicked.
- <i>Kinky Boots.</i>

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:37.192
Now what the heck are you doing here?

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:40.028
I just bought a ticket
to get through security

01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:43.156
so I could come and say a proper goodbye.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:47.077
Classic rom-com leave-cute tactic.

01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:49.621
Love it. Okay.

01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:51.290
Hold on.
You bought yourself a first-class ticket

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.876
- for a flight you ain't ever gonna take?
- It was just force of habit.

01:03:53.876 --> 01:03:55.210
Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:03:56.295 --> 01:03:58.046
I see you're sticking around though, huh?

01:03:59.715 --> 01:04:01.925
Well, Ted,
you're going home to your family and...

01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:06.513
I actually want to stay with mine.

01:04:09.725 --> 01:04:12.561
It's a great picture, you know.
Can't wait to read the article.

01:04:13.145 --> 01:04:14.563
It's not bad, actually.

01:04:14.563 --> 01:04:17.524
I would have preferred if they hadn't
described me as the "club matriarch."

01:04:18.317 --> 01:04:20.944
Yeah. I mean, it does have more gravitas
than "soccer mom."

01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:29.453
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:31.288
- Sorry. No, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:31.288 --> 01:04:32.289
Please, you go first.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:36.376
Thank you.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.671
Thank you.

01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:47.804
Yeah.

01:04:59.525 --> 01:05:00.526
Okay.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.624
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:40.315
<i>Seat belt sign has now been illuminated,</i>

01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:41.692
<i>so please take your seat.</i>

01:05:41.692 --> 01:05:43.527
<i>The cabin door has been closed.</i>

01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:46.446
<i>Flight attendants,
please prepare for gate departure.</i>

01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:55.247
Coach, is this nuts?

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.249
Us leaving like this?

01:05:57.249 --> 01:06:00.085
I mean, we almost won the whole
frigging thing, you know?

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:03.922
Saying goodbye to a bunch of nice folks.

01:06:04.756 --> 01:06:09.261
And I know I've finally accepted
that air conditioning is a privilege

01:06:09.261 --> 01:06:10.721
and not a right.

01:06:12.556 --> 01:06:14.183
I don't know. What do you think?

01:06:20.355 --> 01:06:21.773
I can't do this.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:27.487
I don't wanna go, Ted.
I'm in love with Jane.

01:06:30.574 --> 01:06:32.868
I wanna stay,
and I don't wanna let you down.

01:06:32.868 --> 01:06:36.413
But with your permission, I'd love
to run off this plane and into her arms.

01:06:37.748 --> 01:06:40.125
Well, I mean, what about your luggage?

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:42.836
- Forget my luggage. It's full of rice.
- What? Why?

01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.756
- I haven't slept for three days, man.
- Okay. I'm sorry, you know.

01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:48.383
I've been dreading this.
Talking to you. Abandoning you.

01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:52.012
What? No, no, no, hold on, Coach.
You ain't abandoning me, okay?

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:55.182
You're just following your heart.
I get it.

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.518
And, yeah, you should go.

01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:00.979
But look, man, I don't think
they're gonna let you off this plane

01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:02.189
with that door already shut.

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:10.697
I have a plan.

01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:14.952
Of course you do. Okay.
What do you need me to do?

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.957
Whatever's about to happen,
that's a great start.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:22.751
I love you, Ted.

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:26.630
I love you too, Willis.

01:07:30.259 --> 01:07:32.636
- Oh, boy.
- My appendix!

01:07:32.636 --> 01:07:34.346
- The other side, Coach.
- Thank you.

01:07:35.556 --> 01:07:37.015
Oh, my God. Are you all right, sir?

01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:40.727
Call the medics.

01:07:57.578 --> 01:07:59.830
Would you like to go to the hospital
with your friend?

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.209
Nah. I'm okay. Thanks though.

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.756
What a fucking arsehole.

01:08:12.217 --> 01:08:15.137
<i>Flight attendants cross-check.
Please prepare for departure.</i>

01:08:40.037 --> 01:08:41.205
Oh, God!

01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:44.457
Little love, are you all right?

01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:55.051
It's you.

01:08:55.051 --> 01:08:56.845
<i>Wie is dat</i>, Papa?

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.265
Rebecca.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.102
Rebecca.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.185
We've got to put this one this way.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:51.942
Please welcome the new manager
of AFC Richmond, Roy Kent!

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.112
- Hello!
- Hi!

01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:40.991
Nice to see you.

01:10:52.169 --> 01:10:53.462
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:56.548
- Your name?
- Shannon.

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.596
I have something to show you.

01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:37.673
Go down a little.
And by little, I actually mean,

01:11:37.673 --> 01:11:39.341
- like, three inches.
- Yeah.

01:11:40.384 --> 01:11:41.885
Stop. Good going there, Roy.

01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:43.804
All right, bring me down.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.537
Isn't it marvelous that we can gather here

01:12:08.537 --> 01:12:13.709
on this most historical of monuments
under the gaze of his good Lordship?

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:19.131
Friends and family sharing the love
that is entwined

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.383
for Beard and Jane.

01:12:21.383 --> 01:12:23.260
And not just Beard and Jane,

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:26.430
for Jane beareth
one of God's newest children.

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:27.931
And I know...

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:35.355
<i>This is your captain. Welcome to
Kansas City International Airport.</i>

Dad! Dad!

01:13:03.217 --> 01:13:04.426
Hey.

01:13:13.977 --> 01:13:15.395
Yep. Thank you.

01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:18.023
Come on, man. Talk to me.
How are you doing?

01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:19.149
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.901
What's new?

01:13:33.914 --> 01:13:37.042
All right. Good save.
Let's go. Come on. Let's attack.

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:39.419
Find some space, Henry. There you go.

01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:40.796
Come on, Henry!

01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:42.881
All right. Let it rip.

01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:47.344
- All right, that's okay.
- Shoot.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.472
Hey, Henry. Come here, man.

01:13:52.516 --> 01:13:55.102
- Hey, you okay?
- Can't believe I missed that.

01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:58.188
Hey. Don't worry about all that, okay?
What do we say, huh?

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:00.899
Be a goldfish.

01:14:00.899 --> 01:14:02.192
That's right.

01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:03.819
All right. Now, come on now.
Get on out there.

01:14:03.819 --> 01:14:06.697
- Have some fun, yeah? Attaboy.
- Okay, yeah.

01:14:07.489 --> 01:14:09.283
Come on, boys. Good job, Henry.
