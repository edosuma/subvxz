00:01.182 --> 00:02.462
Previously on "The amazing
Race."

00:02.485 --> 00:06.448
Six teams race to split,
Croatia.

00:06.482 --> 00:13.931
Nicole and victor were stranded,
Until a miracle came through.

00:13.965 --> 00:16.827
My gosh.

00:16.862 --> 00:24.862
In croatia, a high flying
Detour and puzzling roadblock.

00:25.689 --> 00:31.275
Gave tyler and korey their
Fourth consecutive win.

00:31.310 --> 00:38.379
Meanwhile, chris and bret
Squandered a huge lead, sealing.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.275
Their fate.

00:40.310 --> 00:41.275
You have been eliminated from
The race.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.896
Just didn't make good
Decisions today.

00:43.931 --> 00:45.068
Five teams remain.

00:45.103 --> 00:46.263
Who will be eliminated, next?

00:46.287 --> 00:49.080
In is so cool, man!

00:51.517 --> 00:52.631
Which is responsible for its
Caption content and accuracy.

00:52.655 --> 01:00.655
Tyler and korey came in.

01:00.724 --> 01:04.482
First place and won a trip from
Travelocity.

01:04.516 --> 01:09.103
Since the gnome helped us
Win, he should come.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.620
The gnome's coming.

01:10.655 --> 01:12.068
I cannot wait!

01:12.103 --> 01:16.724
Fly to amsterdam and the
Netherlands.

01:16.758 --> 01:22.068
When you arrive, travel by
Train.

01:22.103 --> 01:25.862
Travis and korey will be
The first to leave croatia and.

01:25.896 --> 01:27.724
Fly 800 miles northwest to the
Netherlands.

01:27.758 --> 01:32.034
This is the only country in the
World that runs 100% of its.

01:32.068 --> 01:33.758
Electric trains with wind power.

01:33.793 --> 01:41.793
The teams will catch a train
travel as quick as we can.

01:43.827 --> 01:51.000
The teams will catch a train
travel as quick as we can.

01:51.034 --> 01:54.068
This is our fourth time in a
Row leaving in first place but.

01:54.103 --> 01:57.000
We have really spent time
Building relationships with the.

01:57.034 --> 02:02.482
Other teams so that teams don't
Target us going forward and.

02:02.517 --> 02:10.517
Hopefully we'll make it to the
Final three for the second time.

02:11.137 --> 02:15.034
We have $88 for this leg of
The race.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.517
Tandem bike?

02:16.551 --> 02:17.793
I have one at home.

02:17.827 --> 02:22.000
Will you look up something on
Your phone for us.

02:22.034 --> 02:22.862
Reeva travel.

02:22.896 --> 02:25.068
We are the only non-race team
Left.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.620
We want first place at least
Once.

02:27.655 --> 02:29.535
The takeaway from last leg
Was never give up.

02:29.559 --> 02:31.413
We thought we were out of it.

02:31.448 --> 02:32.517
Always have hope.

02:32.551 --> 02:34.191
Energy and confidence is through
The roof.

02:34.215 --> 02:38.448
We're trying to get to
Amsterdam as fast as possible.

02:38.482 --> 02:42.034
Where's tyler and korey?

02:42.068 --> 02:42.862
Where did you guys go?

02:42.896 --> 02:43.827
He said it was far.

02:43.862 --> 02:45.482
We need two tickets.

02:45.517 --> 02:47.551
If we can do the same flight
They did.

02:47.586 --> 02:50.068
We just got our tickets to
Amsterdam.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.517
On the first flight out of here.

02:52.551 --> 02:57.206
It's time to split!

02:57.241 --> 02:58.551
Netherlands!

02:58.586 --> 02:59.758
Let's go.

02:59.793 --> 03:07.482
This leg of of "The amazing
Race" is a milestone for us.

03:07.517 --> 03:11.482
Leg 10 is a great way for us
To demonstrate our growth as a.

03:11.517 --> 03:12.689
Team.

03:12.724 --> 03:15.965
We're learning that we're
Very different people that get.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.379
Along really well and when we
Mesh that, things go really.

03:19.413 --> 03:20.241
Well.

03:20.275 --> 03:22.689
Bicycles don't unlock until
9:00 a.M.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.586
starting from the same place.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.724
Riva travel.

03:26.758 --> 03:29.000
It's just right there.

03:29.034 --> 03:33.965
I've always wanted to go to
Amsterdam.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.896
We know we're the strongest
Team.

03:35.931 --> 03:39.310
We aren't been performing at the
Strongest level the last eight,

03:39.344 --> 03:40.620
Nine legs.

03:40.655 --> 03:43.175
It's not a good feeling being
Towards the end of the pack but.

03:43.199 --> 03:44.793
The name of the game is
Survival.

03:44.827 --> 03:48.620
We want to make it to the
Final three and have a shot at.

03:48.655 --> 03:49.862
The million.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.256
We'll have an opportunity to
Catch up and have a fighting.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.896
Chance to come in first.

03:53.931 --> 03:57.275
Everything that could go wrong
Did go wrong in the last leg but.

03:57.310 --> 04:00.103
We took it as an opportunity to
Challenge ourselves.

04:00.137 --> 04:03.034
Getting a chance to live through
It, not do it perfectly, helps.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.310
Us get back on our game.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.504
Thank you so much, ladies.

04:05.528 --> 04:07.137
Thank you.

04:07.172 --> 04:09.344
See you in amsterdam.

04:09.379 --> 04:10.551
See you.

04:10.586 --> 04:13.034
We've gotten down to the Wire.

04:13.068 --> 04:13.931
There's no playing around.

04:13.965 --> 04:16.551
This is laser focus.

04:16.586 --> 04:19.000
Bikes unlock at 9:00 a.M.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.724
We'll be right back with the
Other teams.

04:20.757 --> 04:22.931
Let's win this leg!

04:22.965 --> 04:29.827
Amsterdam!

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:50.251 --> 04:51.251
Right behind you.

04:51.275 --> 04:52.241
Straight back.

04:52.275 --> 04:56.103
Everybody thinks that a
U-turn is coming up.

04:56.137 --> 05:00.068
Our game plan is to get there
First, not give anybody else a.

05:00.103 --> 05:01.551
Chance to do anything to us.

05:01.586 --> 05:05.310
Today was going to be a super
Competitive leg.

05:05.344 --> 05:13.344
Ride your bike to jachthaven.

05:17.310 --> 05:20.103
I can barely reach the Pedals.

05:20.137 --> 05:20.827
Jump on the seat.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.862
Hold on.

05:23.896 --> 05:24.931
What are you doing?

05:24.965 --> 05:26.000
Because it's hard.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.413
Today was our first time to
Ride a tandem bike.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.862
You go to steer and the bike
Doesn't turn.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.206
It's like driving a barge.

05:33.241 --> 05:34.551
Are you pedaling?

05:34.586 --> 05:35.517
No, dude.

05:35.551 --> 05:36.103
What?

05:36.137 --> 05:37.172
I'm trying to get on.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.724
You're not pedaling.

05:38.758 --> 05:39.689
No.

05:39.724 --> 05:41.172
When I pedal, it's not good.

05:41.206 --> 05:49.206
The rhythm we finally got
Into was me pedaling.

05:51.241 --> 05:56.620
The rhythm we finally got
Into was me pedaling.

05:56.655 --> 06:00.448
Don't stop, don't stop.

06:00.482 --> 06:03.241
Pedal fast.

06:03.275 --> 06:08.034
Last time I was on "The
Amazing race" and encountered.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.448
Bicycles, it didn't go quite
Well.

06:10.482 --> 06:11.068
Ultimately it's a lot easier
When you don't have a lot of.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.068
Traps on your bike.

06:12.103 --> 06:13.379
Good job.

06:13.413 --> 06:18.310
It's my birthday today so I'm
Hoping we can do really well and.

06:18.344 --> 06:21.793
Not get excited and stay in the
Race.

06:21.827 --> 06:24.103
I'm trying to win on nicole's
Birthday.

06:24.137 --> 06:25.655
Let's do it.

06:25.689 --> 06:33.034
Tandem bike is a little bit
Of a thrill.

06:33.068 --> 06:40.689
I see colin and christie.

06:40.724 --> 06:46.517
This is jachthaven.

06:46.551 --> 06:48.620
Don't tell anybody where that
Is.

06:48.655 --> 06:49.896
Detour.

06:49.931 --> 06:56.448
A few centuries ago, locals
Here hoisted a cow to the top of.

06:56.482 --> 07:00.137
The tower to graze on some
Grass, a tradition that still.

07:00.172 --> 07:01.413
Exists today.

07:01.448 --> 07:05.275
If teams can accomplish this
Feat in under 40 seconds,

07:05.310 --> 07:07.241
They'll receive their next clue.

07:07.275 --> 07:10.551
This is bound to get udderly
Ridiculous.

07:10.586 --> 07:13.758
If there's one thing you can say
About the dutch, they sure do.

07:13.793 --> 07:16.689
Love cheese and eggs.

07:16.724 --> 07:20.551
This detour requires teams to
Ride to this farm which dates.

07:20.586 --> 07:24.586
Back to 1432.

07:24.620 --> 07:27.965
They'll vault across this ditch,
The dutch way.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.034
Or maybe not.

07:29.068 --> 07:32.655
Then they must pick up two
Cheeses and a dozen eggs.

07:32.689 --> 07:36.620
The trick is how to get back
Across the ditch with their.

07:36.655 --> 07:43.896
Cheese and fragile eggs which
They have to deliver to kampen.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.551
Market for their next clue.

07:45.586 --> 07:47.655
We want to do the eggs.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.620
We can do what we want.

07:49.655 --> 07:51.551
We have to find earth number 34.

07:51.586 --> 07:54.310
Good job!

07:54.344 --> 08:00.793
Colin and christie.

08:00.827 --> 08:08.241
We're going to...
We're doing high.

08:08.275 --> 08:09.241
1-2-3 go!

08:09.275 --> 08:11.586
Are they both at number 34?

08:11.620 --> 08:14.344
No, 29.

08:14.379 --> 08:16.448
Earth 29's that way.

08:16.482 --> 08:17.137
Bye, guys.

08:17.172 --> 08:17.896
See you later.

08:17.931 --> 08:21.793
We're by ourselves.

08:21.827 --> 08:29.827
Nick... nic went to do to the
Egg thing.

08:31.827 --> 08:33.482
It might be up there.

08:33.517 --> 08:34.895
My gosh.

08:34.931 --> 08:39.034
Show us how to cross the
Dutch way.

08:39.068 --> 08:42.309
The dutch way to go over a ditch
Is like a pole vault.

08:42.344 --> 08:45.758
You have a metal pole and
Catapult yourself to the other.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.931
Side.

08:46.965 --> 08:50.862
I pole vaulted in college but
This is a little tricky.

08:50.896 --> 08:53.034
Here we go.

08:53.068 --> 08:55.172
Omelette.

08:55.206 --> 08:56.482
Great.

08:56.517 --> 09:04.517
Never done anything like this
that water's so cold, I don't.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.793
Want to go in again.

09:12.827 --> 09:15.310
I'm trying, babe.

09:15.344 --> 09:17.689
I've pole vaulted before.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.103
Nicole, on the other hand, well...

09:20.137 --> 09:22.068
It was terrible.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.137
I've done nothing like this pole
Vaulting maneuver I had to do.

09:25.172 --> 09:27.068
She swallowed so much water.

09:27.103 --> 09:28.724
You want to switch detours?

09:28.758 --> 09:30.793
Nicole, are you kidding me?

09:30.827 --> 09:32.000
We're here.

09:32.034 --> 09:39.448
There's nobody here.

09:39.482 --> 09:40.413
I see cows.

09:40.448 --> 09:42.034
There's a bunch of cows on
The right.

09:42.068 --> 09:45.517
Number 34, right here, right
Here, right here!

09:45.551 --> 09:50.758
This is it.

09:50.793 --> 09:51.551
Here we go.

09:51.586 --> 09:53.413
She was a cow.

09:53.448 --> 09:56.275
Look, it's a face cow.

09:56.310 --> 09:59.275
The good news is we were not
Going to be working with real.

09:59.310 --> 09:59.724
Cause.

09:59.758 --> 10:03.103
Got... cows.

10:03.137 --> 10:04.241
Got it?

10:04.275 --> 10:05.493
The cow was very cooperative,
On her best behavior.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.689
Someone else is here.

10:06.724 --> 10:11.482
Leo and jamal are catching Up.

10:11.517 --> 10:12.827
Can we take you?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.482
Hello!

10:15.517 --> 10:17.034
Mooo!

10:17.068 --> 10:18.586
They're doing it, colin.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.310
She's locked in.

10:21.344 --> 10:22.965
Bessie's ready to go.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.931
This is tight.

10:24.965 --> 10:29.034
We found the cow, hoisted it up,
Got it on the back of the.

10:29.068 --> 10:31.379
Trailer and we're going to
Follow this trailer on our.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.241
Bikes.

10:32.275 --> 10:33.755
We're on our way to the bell
Tower.

10:33.779 --> 10:34.206
1-2-3.

10:34.241 --> 10:40.551
Do we have to follow them?

10:40.586 --> 10:42.137
There's a map.

10:42.172 --> 10:44.275
34... 34.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.206
That way.

10:45.241 --> 10:47.448
Isn't this literally where we
Just went?

10:47.482 --> 10:48.655
I know.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.310
We were either going the
Right way and it's awesome or.

10:51.344 --> 10:53.068
We're going the wrong way.

10:53.103 --> 10:55.379
But I think we're going the
Right way.

10:55.413 --> 10:58.206
Come on, baby, I believe in You.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.379
We need to get closer to the
Ledge.

11:01.413 --> 11:02.413
You just got to jump.

11:02.448 --> 11:02.724
That's it.

11:02.758 --> 11:03.724
Jump.

11:03.758 --> 11:05.586
Good, you got up in the air.

11:05.620 --> 11:06.931
That's the dutch way.

11:06.965 --> 11:07.379
That's good.

11:07.413 --> 11:08.896
That's good?

11:08.931 --> 11:10.000
Come on, baby!

11:10.034 --> 11:14.068
I realized when I jumped, I
Got up off the ground.

11:14.103 --> 11:15.241
That's what I had to do.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.103
Having that momentum to
Propel her to the other side.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.310
A dozen eggs.

11:20.344 --> 11:23.896
A dozen eggs and two cheeses.

11:23.931 --> 11:26.655
Have to jump back with the
Eggs and the cheese.

11:26.689 --> 11:27.896
This is going to be fun.

11:27.931 --> 11:31.206
Since crossing the dutch way was
A little bit difficult for

11:31.241 --> 11:34.379
Nicole, I took it upon myself to
Transport the eggs and the.

11:34.413 --> 11:37.931
Cheese back across, which was
Very nerve-racking because I.

11:37.965 --> 11:43.000
Didn't want to break into the
Eggs and do it again.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.758
The eggs are good.

11:44.793 --> 11:52.793
The eggs are intact.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.965
Putting the cheese in my pocket.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.517
I have some cajones, no pun
Intended.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.655
We got to get to the market.

12:03.689 --> 12:06.034
Got to be careful with the Eggs.

12:06.068 --> 12:07.896
We have to come all the way
Back.

12:07.931 --> 12:11.206
If we break them, yeah.

12:11.241 --> 12:14.344
Let's get a mooove on.

12:14.379 --> 12:16.586
Spin class.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.034
Hello!

12:19.068 --> 12:21.517
Beautiful.

12:21.551 --> 12:23.896
Wow, we're going to that
Bell tower, I think.

12:23.931 --> 12:26.310
That's where we're going.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.034
Hello, do you like our cow?

12:28.068 --> 12:29.172
Let's go.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.689
Come on, come on.

12:30.724 --> 12:38.724
Thank you so much.

12:39.034 --> 12:42.241
Got it, leo.

12:42.275 --> 12:43.241
Watch out.

12:43.275 --> 12:44.413
Damn it.

12:44.448 --> 12:47.413
Two teams out of time.

12:47.448 --> 12:48.827
We'll be the next one to go.

12:48.862 --> 12:52.344
We'll have to use this rope
And a pulley and we have 40.

12:52.379 --> 12:55.344
Seconds to get the cow all the
Way to the top.

12:55.379 --> 12:58.896
I didn't know if we could
Hoist our cow because it's.

12:58.931 --> 13:01.448
Really high up, it's pretty
Heavy and we were neck-and-neck.

13:01.482 --> 13:02.137
With colin and christie.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.034
We didn't want to fall behind.

13:03.068 --> 13:08.241
We were worried.

13:08.275 --> 13:16.275
Ready, steady, go!

13:19.586 --> 13:22.137
Ready, steady, go!

13:22.172 --> 13:24.896
Let me just...
You be pulling on it.

13:24.931 --> 13:28.344
Colin had this technique
Where he was jumping and pulling.

13:28.379 --> 13:31.310
The rope down and I was just
Doing the best I could to keep.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.413
Up with how fast the rope was
Coming down.

13:33.448 --> 13:41.448
I think colin pretty much pulled
That cow up by himself.

13:43.482 --> 13:49.689
I think colin pretty much pulled
That cow up by himself.

13:49.724 --> 13:53.137
I'll run to the top of the
Bell tower.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.965
Got it.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.034
That was a doozy.

13:58.068 --> 14:04.896
I I am just glad it wasn't a
Real cow.

14:04.931 --> 14:05.689
Good morning!

14:05.724 --> 14:11.827
You made it!

14:11.862 --> 14:13.758
Come on, come on!

14:13.793 --> 14:15.275
Congratulations, you made it.

14:15.310 --> 14:16.689
Thank you very much, thank You.

14:16.724 --> 14:17.413
Come on, baby.

14:17.448 --> 14:20.344
Let's go.

14:20.379 --> 14:28.379
Ride your bike along...
Caution, turn ahead.

14:28.758 --> 14:32.068
Teams are about to
Encounter a surprise double.

14:32.103 --> 14:33.344
U-turn.

14:33.379 --> 14:37.034
With only five teams remaining
And no non-eliminations left in.

14:37.068 --> 14:39.428
The race, forcing teams to
Perform both sides of the detour.

14:39.452 --> 14:44.379
Will be challenging.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.620
Let's get past it.

14:46.655 --> 14:47.655
We've got to go.

14:47.689 --> 14:48.344
Fast, fast, fast.

14:48.379 --> 14:49.551
34, could be anywhere.

14:49.586 --> 14:50.586
Hold the bike.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.862
Remember, it was 33 and then
To the right.

14:53.896 --> 14:55.310
Just pointing this way.

14:55.344 --> 14:56.689
Let's go this way.

14:56.724 --> 15:02.241
No 34, we're going out in the
Boonies here.

15:06.241 --> 15:11.172
Reach higher.

15:11.206 --> 15:16.034
Reach higher!

15:16.068 --> 15:16.620
There.

15:16.655 --> 15:23.034
Hold it, hold it.

15:23.068 --> 15:28.517
Colin and christie, we
Overheard them saying there's a.

15:28.551 --> 15:31.034
Double u-turn ahead.

15:31.068 --> 15:37.862
In switzerland, we had a public
Boat for a... vote for a u-turn.

15:37.896 --> 15:42.379
And nicole and victor, the only
Team to vote for us.

15:42.413 --> 15:46.310
This is a strategy move, no
Emotions involved.

15:46.344 --> 15:49.379
It wasn't smart to set up
Enemies in the middle of the.

15:49.413 --> 15:50.586
Race.

15:50.620 --> 15:54.448
Pedaling a bike that's meant
For two to be pedaling is.

15:54.482 --> 15:55.689
Exhausting.

15:55.724 --> 16:00.379
To make sure the eggs didn't
Break, I told nicole not to.

16:00.413 --> 16:02.206
Pedal, make sure the eggs are
Sustained.

16:02.241 --> 16:06.482
I'm not even pedaling and I'm
Tired.

16:06.517 --> 16:07.103
U-turn right here.

16:07.137 --> 16:08.620
Right here, here it is.

16:08.655 --> 16:10.344
Ok, guys, let's talk.

16:10.379 --> 16:13.172
We'll leave it alone.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.827
Let's let everyone else work it
Out.

16:14.862 --> 16:16.379
I'm ok with that.

16:16.413 --> 16:24.413
Everybody knew the the afg
Animals would u-turn somebody.

16:30.758 --> 16:35.034
Drive yourself to the boat
Rental and canal cruises for the.

16:35.068 --> 16:35.689
Next clue.

16:35.724 --> 16:37.310
Let's just do it.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.034
We're in to.

16:39.068 --> 16:45.689
We're in it.

16:45.724 --> 16:46.689
Here it is.

16:46.724 --> 16:50.000
We passed it.

16:50.034 --> 16:51.655
Pedal, pedal.

16:51.689 --> 16:54.793
This is it.

16:54.827 --> 16:55.896
They're not real cows.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.827
They're fake cows.

16:57.862 --> 17:01.103
1-2-3, you got it?

17:01.137 --> 17:02.551
It's pretty light.

17:02.586 --> 17:06.655
Let's jog.

17:06.689 --> 17:08.068
Ready?

17:08.103 --> 17:09.137
Yay!

17:09.172 --> 17:13.310
We're coming for you, cow!

17:13.344 --> 17:13.964
Moo, moo!

17:14.000 --> 17:15.862
The market's right there.

17:15.896 --> 17:19.448
Watch out, don't touch anything.

17:19.482 --> 17:21.827
Hi.

17:21.862 --> 17:23.723
What do you got for me?

17:23.758 --> 17:24.655
One, two.

17:24.689 --> 17:25.758
Number two.

17:25.792 --> 17:28.758
And a dozen eggs.

17:28.793 --> 17:29.655
One, two.

17:29.689 --> 17:32.000
We delivered our eggs and our
Cheese.

17:32.034 --> 17:33.482
He looked those over so
Carefully.

17:33.517 --> 17:36.862
I was like, please no cracks or
We'd have to start over.

17:36.896 --> 17:41.689
12.

17:41.724 --> 17:43.275
My god, that was hard.

17:43.310 --> 17:43.931
Thank you!

17:43.965 --> 17:45.448
Thank you!

17:45.482 --> 17:47.862
Double u-turn ahead!

17:47.896 --> 17:49.034
Double u-turn ahead.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.379
I'm freaking out.

17:52.413 --> 17:54.000
Looking for a double u-turn.

17:54.034 --> 17:55.931
I'm looking at the signs.

17:55.965 --> 17:58.034
None of that is familiar.

17:58.068 --> 18:01.310
You got to hurry, though, so we
Can u-turn someone else.

18:01.344 --> 18:02.586
Double u-turn ahead.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.551
We got to make sure we get
There first.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.275
We want to u-turn...
Nicole and victor.

18:08.310 --> 18:11.896
We're in a really big hurry.

18:11.931 --> 18:12.793
To the right.

18:12.827 --> 18:13.827
Go, go, go.

18:13.862 --> 18:15.448
Stay positive.

18:15.482 --> 18:17.000
My god.

18:17.034 --> 18:19.275
Where is it at?

18:19.310 --> 18:19.896
Where's it at?

18:19.931 --> 18:22.172
Damn it!

18:30.758 --> 18:32.379
That was it, you see.

18:32.413 --> 18:33.241
Thank god, found it.

18:33.275 --> 18:39.103
Is there already u-turns?

18:39.137 --> 18:40.103
Sorry, nicole and victor, we're
Definitely going to u-turn you.

18:40.137 --> 18:41.241
To get back even.

18:41.275 --> 18:43.448
Nicole, happy birthday.

18:43.482 --> 18:46.103
Let's go.

18:46.137 --> 18:48.896
U-turn.

18:48.931 --> 18:50.551
Damn it!

18:50.586 --> 18:56.275
The afganimals u-turned us.

18:56.310 --> 19:01.000
I did say their name in
Switzerland but they never got.

19:01.034 --> 19:02.310
U-turned.

19:02.344 --> 19:05.620
Hopefully team fun is behind
Us, either that or let ourselves.

19:05.655 --> 19:06.724
Go out.

19:06.758 --> 19:09.724
I don't like leo and jamal.

19:09.758 --> 19:12.517
Pedal faster, pedal faster.

19:12.551 --> 19:17.448
We just saw nicole and Victor.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.862
They seemed frustrated.

19:19.896 --> 19:22.620
It could mean we made it before
Them.

19:22.655 --> 19:24.379
This is probably the return,
Right here.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.068
This is it.

19:26.103 --> 19:28.034
We are looking forward marked
Cars now.

19:28.068 --> 19:28.931
That's them.

19:28.965 --> 19:31.379
Let's do it!

19:31.413 --> 19:36.413
Let's go.

19:36.448 --> 19:37.482
Just let them go.

19:37.517 --> 19:41.620
We are coming up, peeps.

19:41.655 --> 19:44.586
Korey and tyler, they're like
Behind some cars.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.517
Can you let me out?

19:46.551 --> 19:48.586
I want to follow our friends.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.586
They all just went without Us.

19:51.620 --> 19:59.620
Look, nic and vic.

20:02.448 --> 20:06.482
Happy birthday, nicole, sorry
Not sorry.

20:06.517 --> 20:07.896
I got it.

20:07.931 --> 20:14.931
Ready, steady, go!

20:14.965 --> 20:18.448
We had a strategy.

20:18.482 --> 20:21.724
We communicated.

20:21.758 --> 20:26.241
Up, pull down, up, pull down,
Until we were pulling together.

20:26.275 --> 20:33.379
So neither one of us had to pull
Down by ourselves.

20:33.413 --> 20:35.275
Pull, pull, pull!

20:35.310 --> 20:37.310
Strong.

20:37.344 --> 20:41.586
It's up.

20:41.620 --> 20:48.310
Ready, go.

20:48.344 --> 20:49.724
Thank you.

20:49.758 --> 20:52.034
Caution u-turn ahead.

20:52.068 --> 20:56.551
Damn it.

20:56.586 --> 20:58.310
My god.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.655
I don't even know, dude.

21:00.689 --> 21:02.310
This is difficult.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.482
It's a little bit complicated
Up in here.

21:05.517 --> 21:10.275
Hopefully everyone is
Struggling because these street.

21:10.310 --> 21:14.241
Signs are crazy.

21:14.275 --> 21:16.551
Boat rental canal cruises, right
Here.

21:16.586 --> 21:20.620
There's the clue marker.

21:20.655 --> 21:23.551
Rock and roll to the clue Box.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.034
Race by boat, train to the
Next pit stop.

21:26.068 --> 21:34.068
The village of giethoorn
Has no roads or cars.

21:35.068 --> 21:40.000
Navigating through this maze of
Waterways, teams must create a.

21:40.034 --> 21:47.551
Boat train and steer it through
The congested canals.

21:47.586 --> 21:49.586
The pit stop of this leg of the
Race.

21:49.620 --> 21:53.551
The last team to check in with
Me will be eliminated.

21:53.586 --> 21:55.448
We're going to the pit stop.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.000
Let's go.

21:58.034 --> 22:03.275
We're getting to the pit stop
Right now.

22:03.310 --> 22:07.344
Last team to the checkpoint
Will be eliminated.

22:07.379 --> 22:10.655
Search the canal for two
Locations with marked boats.

22:10.689 --> 22:13.448
I think they might be hidden.

22:13.482 --> 22:16.620
I have driven a lot of boats.

22:16.655 --> 22:24.655
I grew up on padre island on
Corpus christi.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.862
I felt right at home.

22:27.896 --> 22:30.896
We're looking for boats to
Attach to us.

22:30.931 --> 22:34.275
Look how cute these little
Houses are.

22:34.310 --> 22:35.413
People live like this.

22:35.448 --> 22:38.068
It's awesome.

22:38.103 --> 22:39.413
Where are we?

22:39.448 --> 22:41.241
I feel like we're in a movie.

22:41.275 --> 22:42.758
It's crazy.

22:42.793 --> 22:43.655
A cat!

22:43.689 --> 22:45.413
Cats on boats on laps?

22:45.448 --> 22:49.310
That was the coolest thing
I've seen in my life.

22:49.344 --> 22:50.137
Dogs.

22:50.172 --> 22:51.517
Little doggy.

22:51.551 --> 22:54.275
Birds.

22:54.310 --> 22:54.827
All kinds of animals in holland.

22:54.862 --> 22:58.206
So much fun.

22:58.241 --> 23:02.965
We're supposed to be
Searching canals for boats.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.586
Searching the canals.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.793
There it is, right there.

23:08.827 --> 23:13.448
We got u-turn.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.931
We got u-turned by victor and
Nicole.

23:15.965 --> 23:18.793
We have to use the other side
Of the detour, right?

23:18.827 --> 23:19.655
That sucks.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.689
Damn it.

23:20.724 --> 23:25.068
We are far behind is the reality
Of it right now.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.034
Nicole, you have to pedal Hard.

23:27.068 --> 23:27.448
I am.

23:27.482 --> 23:28.551
I'm tired.

23:28.586 --> 23:31.586
I regretted having nicole not
Pedal to the market.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.724
I had used a lot of my energy
And now to have to go all the.

23:34.758 --> 23:38.000
Way back to the second detour
Was going to be very difficult.

23:38.034 --> 23:39.954
It looks like there's a farm
Thing over there.

23:39.978 --> 23:40.689
My gosh.

23:40.724 --> 23:42.034
What does this say?

23:42.068 --> 23:44.172
Those numbers don't pertain.

23:44.206 --> 23:46.896
We could not find the second
Detour at all.

23:46.931 --> 23:48.965
We don't know if we would
Ever find it.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.413
What are we missing?

23:50.448 --> 23:51.724
Earth 29.

23:51.758 --> 23:57.551
There it is, yes.Úit's ok, we ca
victor and nicole u-turned us.

23:57.586 --> 24:05.586
So woo had to... we had to do th
Other side of the detour.

24:10.137 --> 24:12.206
12 eggs, two cheeses.

24:12.241 --> 24:13.275
Careful with them.

24:13.310 --> 24:16.034
Maybe I can throw the cheese
Over.

24:16.068 --> 24:19.206
You could just toss the Cheese.

24:19.241 --> 24:21.000
Cheese isn't fragile.

24:21.034 --> 24:22.206
It's like a ball.

24:22.241 --> 24:23.424
Getting the eggs over to the
Other side of the canal was a.

24:23.448 --> 24:25.808
Completely different story
Because you didn't want to crack.

24:25.832 --> 24:26.241
The eggs.

24:26.275 --> 24:34.275
I held them in my hand and
Went across the dutch way.

24:36.275 --> 24:40.827
I held them in my hand and
Went across the dutch way.

24:40.862 --> 24:41.965
Here it is.

24:42.000 --> 24:42.896
34.

24:42.931 --> 24:43.827
Right there.

24:43.862 --> 24:44.137
This is it.

24:44.172 --> 24:44.586
Nice.

24:44.620 --> 24:45.827
We passed it.

24:45.862 --> 24:48.206
It's right on the front.

24:48.241 --> 24:48.862
Wow.

24:48.896 --> 24:51.172
These are the cows, yeah.

24:51.206 --> 24:52.482
Stay strong.

24:52.517 --> 24:53.758
You never know what you can do.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.344
Right here, nic.

24:55.379 --> 24:59.000
I got it, I got it.

24:59.034 --> 25:01.620
I'm so mad at us.

25:01.655 --> 25:03.310
I'm so mad we passed it.

25:03.344 --> 25:07.758
We drove right by this car.

25:07.793 --> 25:09.275
This is the market.

25:09.310 --> 25:11.241
Yeah, this is the market.

25:11.275 --> 25:13.448
Did you carry the eggs?

25:13.482 --> 25:14.310
Yeah, cheese vendor.

25:14.344 --> 25:16.586
I have two cheeses for you.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.586
We have 12 eggs for you.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.586
One... I'm very sorry.

25:22.620 --> 25:23.655
That's ok.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.379
I can't take this.

25:26.413 --> 25:27.482
It's not intact.

25:27.517 --> 25:32.724
It was a complete moment of
Loss.

25:32.758 --> 25:36.000
I want to throw that in your
Face right now, you know that.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.724
I have no idea why we did not
Check those eggs.

25:39.758 --> 25:42.103
The one thing we should have
Focused on, we didn't.

25:42.137 --> 25:43.379
I'm sorry.

25:43.413 --> 25:46.034
Have to go back.

25:46.068 --> 25:47.275
Ok.

25:47.310 --> 25:49.670
We made a really terrible
Mistake but at that point there.

25:49.694 --> 25:52.517
Was no other option except to go
Back and get the egg.

25:52.551 --> 25:56.620
This sucks, damn it.

26:05.275 --> 26:06.551
That was an idiotic mistake.

26:06.586 --> 26:10.758
We got to the market and one
Of our eggs were cracked so now.

26:10.793 --> 26:14.344
We have to go back and get
Another egg at the farm.

26:14.379 --> 26:16.965
We're going to check them
Before we leave.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Not idiots.

26:18.034 --> 26:21.034
Literally the stupidest thing we
Could have done.

26:21.068 --> 26:24.103
I'm pissed!

26:24.137 --> 26:25.689
Clue box.

26:25.724 --> 26:26.655
These let there be three
Clues in it.

26:26.689 --> 26:27.172
Three.

26:27.206 --> 26:28.896
Thank god.

26:28.931 --> 26:30.620
We're searching the canals for
Two boats.

26:30.655 --> 26:31.344
Hi!

26:31.379 --> 26:35.689
My god, boys with beers.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.655
Men.

26:36.689 --> 26:38.620
Hello!

26:38.655 --> 26:42.172
I feel good that there were
Three cars here and two teams.

26:42.206 --> 26:46.413
Behind us.

26:46.448 --> 26:48.379
I got it.

26:48.413 --> 26:49.068
There.

26:49.103 --> 26:50.862
There's five marked boats.

26:50.896 --> 26:51.620
Good call.

26:51.655 --> 26:54.103
Come in.

26:54.137 --> 26:55.517
My god.

26:55.551 --> 26:57.034
Sorry.

26:57.068 --> 26:59.103
You want to attach to the back?

26:59.137 --> 27:00.896
It has to be attached to the
Back.

27:00.931 --> 27:02.000
Tie us to that.

27:02.034 --> 27:04.551
I got this.

27:04.586 --> 27:06.000
Right in the groin.

27:06.034 --> 27:07.241
One boat was hard enough.

27:07.275 --> 27:11.379
When you add a second, it was
Almost impossible to navigate.

27:11.413 --> 27:14.034
Leo, I'm going back this way.

27:14.068 --> 27:15.758
My god!

27:15.793 --> 27:18.862
I don't know how to swim.

27:18.896 --> 27:20.000
Marked boats.

27:20.034 --> 27:22.241
They're right here.

27:22.275 --> 27:23.241
Check us out.

27:23.275 --> 27:27.172
We found the first group of
Marked boats.

27:27.206 --> 27:27.793
Perfect.

27:27.827 --> 27:29.310
Here we go, here we go.

27:29.344 --> 27:33.034
This is going to be really
Unwieldy to try to turn.

27:33.068 --> 27:37.551
Heads up.

27:37.586 --> 27:39.034
Sorry!

27:39.068 --> 27:40.310
Ok, come on.

27:40.344 --> 27:41.620
We got it, we got it.

27:41.655 --> 27:42.896
We got this, baby.

27:42.931 --> 27:45.000
We have to give our all right
Now.

27:45.034 --> 27:48.586
Ready, go!

27:48.620 --> 27:51.586
Help pull.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.827
Pull.

27:52.862 --> 27:55.182
I'm literally putting my
Whole weight on it and it's not.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.000
Even moving.

27:56.034 --> 28:00.034
That cow was heavier than I
Thought.

28:00.068 --> 28:08.068
My god, I just hit my
Frickin' arm bone.

28:08.148 --> 28:09.148
Time is over.

28:09.172 --> 28:10.896
First try, done.

28:10.931 --> 28:12.931
Just give me two seconds.

28:12.965 --> 28:17.068
To think that we had to hoist
The cow up I don't know how many.

28:17.103 --> 28:18.965
Stories and we're dry heaving.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.137
We don't know how we're going to
Summon the energy to hoist this.

28:22.172 --> 28:26.344
Cow up again.

28:26.379 --> 28:30.620
Let's go!

28:30.655 --> 28:32.068
Go, go, go.

28:32.103 --> 28:36.655
Ok, we'll get them across and
Check the eggs.

28:36.689 --> 28:37.689
Go, go, go.

28:37.724 --> 28:38.931
Make sure they look good.

28:38.965 --> 28:41.172
They look good.

28:41.206 --> 28:45.103
Even though we made a really
Terrible mistake, we weren't.

28:45.137 --> 28:48.931
Going to quit and we know victor
And nicole had to do the other.

28:48.965 --> 28:52.689
Side of the detour so we knew we
Still had a shot.

28:52.724 --> 28:53.379
We got this.

28:53.413 --> 28:54.034
Let's go!

28:54.068 --> 28:56.655
Hello.

28:56.689 --> 28:58.529
"Amazing race," we're in first
Place right now.

28:58.553 --> 28:59.034
Keep it up.

28:59.068 --> 29:00.068
Thank you, thank you.

29:00.517 --> 29:01.689
Are those the flags?

29:01.724 --> 29:02.758
I don't see anything.

29:02.793 --> 29:06.379
Move on, go, go.

29:06.413 --> 29:07.344
We're second.

29:07.379 --> 29:12.275
They only had one boat behind
Them, right?

29:12.310 --> 29:14.137
Look, they're not marked.

29:14.172 --> 29:14.965
Those are marked.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.103
Found the other boat.

29:16.137 --> 29:17.862
Just got to get across the
Canal.

29:17.896 --> 29:19.551
One second, people, sorry.

29:19.586 --> 29:26.586
We are backing in to attach the
Second boat of our train.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.206
Count the boats.

29:28.241 --> 29:28.862
Should be five.

29:28.896 --> 29:31.068
There's five boats here.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.034
So we just got back in the lead.

29:33.068 --> 29:34.310
This is awesome.

29:34.344 --> 29:35.931
Let's rock and roll.

29:35.965 --> 29:36.896
Ok.

29:36.931 --> 29:37.689
Let's do this.

29:37.724 --> 29:39.310
We found our two boats.

29:39.344 --> 29:40.344
We are good.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.034
Now we are going out to the
Lake.

29:42.068 --> 29:43.241
Yeah, yeah, push us.

29:43.275 --> 29:44.172
That's good.

29:44.206 --> 29:45.413
Good, good, good, thank you.

29:45.448 --> 29:46.275
Thank you.

29:46.310 --> 29:47.137
Looking for phil.

29:47.172 --> 29:51.206
And the pit stop.

29:51.241 --> 29:52.655
Yay!

29:52.689 --> 29:57.344
The canals were so narrow and
There were so many people out.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.965
Today, it was such a beautiful
Day, it was crowded.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.103
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

30:04.137 --> 30:07.172
I felt like we were playing
Bumper cars.

30:07.206 --> 30:11.034
I am so sorry.

30:11.068 --> 30:13.448
This is a challenge.

30:13.482 --> 30:14.724
Ok.

30:14.758 --> 30:18.379
The second time, it's like,
All right, come on!

30:18.413 --> 30:19.724
We're still in it.

30:19.758 --> 30:22.344
There's a chance for a million
Dollars.

30:22.379 --> 30:24.344
We can do this.

30:24.379 --> 30:26.137
Go!

30:26.172 --> 30:27.655
Use all my weight.

30:27.689 --> 30:30.000
We just go to town.

30:30.034 --> 30:31.620
As it's getting closer to the
Top.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.413
We're starting to get really
Tired but I'm like, it's just.

30:34.448 --> 30:35.000
Right there.

30:35.034 --> 30:39.931
We can do it, vic!

30:39.965 --> 30:47.793
Ok!

30:47.827 --> 30:49.724
Yes, you did it!

30:49.758 --> 30:52.172
Thank you!

30:52.206 --> 30:53.413
Congratulations.

30:53.448 --> 30:54.896
Was it easier on the way Down?

30:54.931 --> 30:55.275
No.

30:55.310 --> 30:57.724
Good job.

30:57.758 --> 30:59.241
Excuse me.

30:59.275 --> 31:02.655
They're right behind us.

31:02.689 --> 31:03.724
Good job.

31:03.758 --> 31:07.517
We're almost there.

31:07.551 --> 31:10.655
I won't throw an egg at your
Face, I swear.

31:10.689 --> 31:11.241
Careful.

31:11.275 --> 31:11.896
Give me what you got.

31:11.931 --> 31:15.620
12 eggs.

31:15.655 --> 31:16.206
Thank you.

31:16.241 --> 31:20.793
Thank you very much.

31:20.827 --> 31:22.379
Make a right.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.517
Are you sure?

31:24.551 --> 31:25.793
Make a right.

31:25.827 --> 31:29.551
The train of three boats in
The canal, clearly in the canal.

31:29.586 --> 31:30.827
We've come so far now.

31:30.862 --> 31:33.206
We can't backtrack here.

31:33.241 --> 31:35.931
We thought this would be an
Easy leg.

31:35.965 --> 31:38.724
Come on, damn it!

31:38.758 --> 31:43.103
There they are, there's the
Marked boats.

31:43.137 --> 31:43.931
All aboard.

31:43.965 --> 31:46.137
I'm going to reverse out and
Back in.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.413
We only need one more.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.103
One more.

31:48.137 --> 31:50.379
We're making a train.

31:50.413 --> 31:53.655
Who wants to be part of it?

31:53.689 --> 31:54.689
This is it, the pit stop.

31:54.724 --> 31:56.862
I think we just tie up right
Here.

31:56.896 --> 31:58.655
My god, that's so cute.

31:58.689 --> 32:00.413
Look at you.

32:00.448 --> 32:03.620
Grab the backpacks.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.758
Here we go.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.758
You guys live in such a
Beautiful place!

32:07.793 --> 32:08.551
My god!

32:08.586 --> 32:10.620
Look at this place!

32:10.655 --> 32:11.862
Can we make it through?

32:11.896 --> 32:15.413
Colin and christie, I'm
Pleased to tell you you are team.

32:15.448 --> 32:17.655
Number one!

32:17.689 --> 32:19.034
And I have great news for.

32:19.068 --> 32:19.586
You.

32:19.620 --> 32:27.620
How about $7500 each!

32:27.896 --> 32:29.379
I'll take it, phil!

32:29.413 --> 32:34.275
The first time we did this
Race, we won six legs and pushed.

32:34.310 --> 32:35.448
Really, really hard.

32:35.482 --> 32:38.862
This time we said let's not burn
Out and peak at the end.

32:38.896 --> 32:41.241
We can get into the final three.

32:41.275 --> 32:45.034
We have what it takes to do
It but we're not taking anything.

32:45.068 --> 32:45.827
For granted.

32:45.862 --> 32:47.182
This is the station right Here.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.113
I'm returning this.

32:48.147 --> 32:51.586
Can you drive?

32:51.620 --> 32:53.241
Looks like it's stick shift.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.482
Never giving up.

32:54.517 --> 32:59.241
You never know what the other
Teams are going through.

32:59.275 --> 33:02.103
Pedal, pedal, pedal and Coast.

33:02.137 --> 33:02.517
Whoa, whoa!

33:02.551 --> 33:03.689
I'm so sorry.

33:03.724 --> 33:04.965
Let's get out of here.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.413
This is it.

33:07.448 --> 33:13.000
Just need to keep racing like
We're in it to win it.

33:13.034 --> 33:17.793
I don't know why we thought
It would go all the way to the.

33:17.827 --> 33:19.827
Lake and find another boat.

33:19.862 --> 33:21.662
Excuse me, where's the entrance
To the canals?

33:21.686 --> 33:23.482
Number two.

33:23.517 --> 33:25.448
Right here, the entrance.

33:25.482 --> 33:30.000
Do we go back in or go further?

33:30.034 --> 33:36.482
We have to go back in here.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.965
Sorry.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.827
We made a mistake.

33:43.862 --> 33:47.103
Come back, go to the lake.

33:47.137 --> 33:47.724
Ok.

33:47.758 --> 33:49.689
This is going to be tough.

33:49.724 --> 33:51.655
You want to the reverse down
That?

33:51.689 --> 33:53.896
My goodness, I'm sorry.

33:53.931 --> 33:56.827
I am sorry, everyone.

33:56.862 --> 34:00.068
Guys, are you idiots or
Something like that?

34:00.103 --> 34:01.965
I don't mean to be.

34:02.000 --> 34:02.655
It's a very busy afternoon.

34:02.689 --> 34:03.689
I see that.

34:03.724 --> 34:08.034
Go, ty, gun it.

34:08.068 --> 34:08.965
That's mark.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.688
I see it.

34:10.724 --> 34:14.344
Ma'am, the lake's that way?

34:14.379 --> 34:15.620
Yes, and to the right.

34:15.655 --> 34:17.172
Now that was a lovely local.

34:17.206 --> 34:20.551
My leg!

34:20.585 --> 34:22.655
Please, god, be two clues in
There?

34:22.688 --> 34:24.413
Yeah, there is.

34:24.447 --> 34:26.827
Are you driving?

34:26.862 --> 34:34.068
We were going the wrong way
In the canals so now we're going.

34:34.103 --> 34:40.793
Back through a little swamp area
To try to navigate to the lake.

34:40.827 --> 34:46.068
It's going really slow,
Something's stuck in the motor.

34:46.103 --> 34:48.482
How do we get this up?

34:48.516 --> 34:50.241
There's something stuck in it.

34:50.275 --> 34:50.793
There's no gas.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.379
It's electric.

34:52.413 --> 34:53.344
It's not going.

34:53.379 --> 34:55.896
How do we fix the motor?

34:55.931 --> 34:57.344
We need help.

35:04.665 --> 35:05.985
I don't know where we are, Man.

35:06.009 --> 35:06.655
Damn it.

35:06.689 --> 35:08.489
Excuse me, do you know how to
Fix our poet?

35:08.513 --> 35:11.172
It's... boat.

35:11.206 --> 35:16.310
It's not going.

35:16.344 --> 35:17.793
It's clear now.

35:17.827 --> 35:19.551
It's clear?

35:19.586 --> 35:20.034
Yes.

35:20.068 --> 35:20.896
Better?

35:20.931 --> 35:22.827
Thank you so much.

35:22.862 --> 35:24.586
Come on, leo.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.758
So now we're going to make up
Some time.

35:27.793 --> 35:35.310
Excuse me, how do we go to
The beginning of the canal?

35:35.344 --> 35:39.448
I think the other teams are
Caught up by now.

35:39.482 --> 35:43.000
Keep running from worst to
First, first to worst.

35:43.034 --> 35:43.551
Go.

35:43.586 --> 35:44.689
Is that a power boat?

35:44.724 --> 35:46.034
Right here, right here.

35:46.068 --> 35:46.620
Ready?

35:46.655 --> 35:47.379
Let's go.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.724
We are not out of this, Floyd.

35:48.758 --> 35:50.586
We're going to find these Boats.

35:50.620 --> 35:55.448
We are going to find these
Boats:

35:55.482 --> 36:00.827
This is scary.

36:00.862 --> 36:04.275
If I see team fun, I'm going to
Crap myself.

36:04.310 --> 36:06.896
They're right there.

36:06.931 --> 36:07.862
Leo and jamal.

36:07.896 --> 36:08.482
Please stop.

36:08.517 --> 36:09.551
Sorry, sorry.

36:09.586 --> 36:10.793
What are they doing?

36:10.827 --> 36:15.103
We saw leo and jamal and we
Thought they were way ahead of.

36:15.137 --> 36:16.206
Us.

36:16.241 --> 36:19.172
They u-turned us so catching
Up to them is great.

36:19.206 --> 36:21.448
This way, this way.

36:21.482 --> 36:24.241
I hope this is stop one.

36:24.275 --> 36:25.379
There's only two here.

36:25.413 --> 36:26.034
Reverse, reverse.

36:26.068 --> 36:26.586
We're doing good.

36:26.620 --> 36:30.586
We're still in it.

36:30.620 --> 36:38.620
Please, god, tell me this is
The right lake.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.034
Aim right at the island.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.034
We're good.

36:44.068 --> 36:45.724
Where do you think you
Finished up?

36:45.758 --> 36:51.758
Our best guess is three, but
Honestly we have no idea.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.448
You're become extremely
Optimistic.

36:54.482 --> 36:55.689
Wow.

36:55.724 --> 36:56.655
Just kidding.

36:56.689 --> 36:57.724
Team number two!

36:57.758 --> 36:58.965
My god.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.482
Come on!

37:01.517 --> 37:07.793
Have some fun with me now,
Come on.

37:07.827 --> 37:09.103
Right there, marked boat.

37:09.137 --> 37:10.034
You see it?

37:10.068 --> 37:12.034
Yeah, I saw the flag waving
In the wind.

37:12.068 --> 37:16.862
Yeah, we found the boat.

37:16.896 --> 37:19.344
We have to find one more
Marked boat.

37:19.379 --> 37:21.034
It has to be that right There.

37:21.068 --> 37:21.931
Yeah.

37:21.965 --> 37:23.724
We bypassed it.

37:23.758 --> 37:25.000
I can't believe we missed it.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.517
So stupid!

37:26.551 --> 37:28.172
Why did we do that?

37:28.206 --> 37:30.517
Now we've got our last boat.

37:30.551 --> 37:32.724
We've got to find the exit here.

37:32.758 --> 37:34.689
Tell me if you've seen nicole
And victor?

37:34.724 --> 37:36.068
They're behind us.

37:36.103 --> 37:39.413
Is that a marked boat down
There?

37:39.448 --> 37:41.448
Yeap, yeap, yeap.

37:41.482 --> 37:42.275
Good find.

37:42.310 --> 37:44.000
I got to tie them as tight as we
Can.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.000
Ready?

37:45.034 --> 37:45.931
Yeah.

37:45.965 --> 37:51.137
Do you know where boneville
Drive lake is?

37:51.172 --> 37:51.862
Thank you.

37:51.896 --> 37:55.344
We got to work miracles here.

37:55.379 --> 37:58.586
High five, man.

37:58.620 --> 37:59.137
Have a good day.

37:59.172 --> 38:00.379
We stayed positive.

38:00.413 --> 38:03.931
We didn't know what victor
And nicole were doing and we.

38:03.965 --> 38:05.793
Knew we still had a shot.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.275
We did it!

38:07.310 --> 38:07.965
Push it.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.413
This is going to be heavy.

38:10.448 --> 38:14.758
Chugga chugga choo choo to
The pit stop.

38:14.793 --> 38:15.793
Here we go.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.206
Isn't that crazy.

38:17.241 --> 38:20.551
There's no signs for the lake.

38:20.586 --> 38:23.137
Maybe it's like common
Knowledge.

38:23.172 --> 38:24.034
You got to follow the canal out.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.172
I hope the lake's not that Way.

38:26.206 --> 38:30.758
Where the hell could phil be?

38:30.793 --> 38:31.310
Phil!

38:31.344 --> 38:36.206
Leo, make your way.

38:36.241 --> 38:38.275
What the hell happened to you
Guys?

38:38.310 --> 38:39.724
What is going on?

38:39.758 --> 38:42.586
We wanted to take the scenic
Route.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.034
We could have been first Place.

38:44.068 --> 38:45.034
U-turn.

38:45.068 --> 38:47.275
We wanted to get back to
Nicole and victor.

38:47.310 --> 38:48.710
Give them a taste of their
Medicine.

38:48.734 --> 38:52.931
We wanted a cushion and now
We're going to go on the 11th.

38:52.965 --> 38:55.206
Leg and win "The amazing race."

38:55.241 --> 38:59.689
wow, this is going to be Tough.

38:59.724 --> 39:00.689
This is so slow.

39:00.724 --> 39:03.206
You're sure this is as fast
As it goes?

39:03.241 --> 39:05.344
Nicole, we have three boats.

39:05.379 --> 39:06.172
Is that the island?

39:06.206 --> 39:07.517
It's so far.

39:07.551 --> 39:08.482
I would head towards that.

39:08.517 --> 39:09.827
Yeah, I think that's it.

39:09.862 --> 39:11.275
Is the lake this way?

39:11.310 --> 39:12.413
This way.

39:12.448 --> 39:13.965
The lake, that way?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.206
You can go through here.

39:16.241 --> 39:17.724
Thank you very much.

39:17.758 --> 39:22.206
It's possible the other team
Went straight there.

39:22.241 --> 39:24.068
If that happened, we're still in
The game.

39:24.103 --> 39:26.620
I'll be panicked if I see
Another team.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.137
I'm getting nervous.

39:28.172 --> 39:29.827
We're behind so it's scary.

39:29.862 --> 39:32.931
I'm trying to see phil.

39:32.965 --> 39:35.344
Lake is this way?

39:35.379 --> 39:38.310
To the island!

39:38.344 --> 39:39.620
Island!

39:39.655 --> 39:41.965
I think I see... no.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.137
That's not good.

39:44.172 --> 39:47.034
I can't believe it.

39:47.068 --> 39:52.034
We're chugga chug-a-lugging.

39:52.068 --> 39:53.241
Thank gosh!

39:53.275 --> 39:55.000
Let's go.

39:55.034 --> 39:58.689
Nicole and victor, obviously
You were u-turned.

39:58.724 --> 40:00.655
I'm going to put you out of your
Misery.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.448
You are team number four.

40:03.482 --> 40:06.172
This is the craziest, best.

40:06.206 --> 40:08.931
Experience ever, seeing the
World with someone that I love.

40:08.965 --> 40:12.896
I am so happy we're still in
This race.

40:12.931 --> 40:14.793
That's what I wanted for my
Birthday present.

40:14.827 --> 40:16.137
You're welcome.

40:16.172 --> 40:21.551
You are the only team left
Who have not raced in "The."

40:21.586 --> 40:22.310
"Amazing race" before.

40:22.344 --> 40:23.689
We've never gotten first.

40:23.724 --> 40:27.758
We don't have to be first but
Have to beat one team in each.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.034
Leg to get to the final.

40:29.068 --> 40:31.551
It's very possible.

40:31.586 --> 40:33.448
I don't want to count the Boats.

40:33.482 --> 40:35.793
I just want to know when we get
There.

40:35.827 --> 40:40.379
Land ho, team fun.

40:40.413 --> 40:44.310
We got everything, fanny Pack?

40:44.344 --> 40:47.206
Becca and floyd, I am
Sorry to tell you that you are.

40:47.241 --> 40:52.448
The last team to arrive.

40:52.482 --> 40:56.724
There are no more
Non-eliminations in the race so.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.000
Unfortunately you have been
Eliminated from the race.

40:59.034 --> 41:03.413
Ouch.

41:03.448 --> 41:09.000
Kept hope alive right to
The end, right?

41:09.034 --> 41:11.517
I believed it was her destiny
To win.

41:11.551 --> 41:14.965
But I guess it's our destiny to
Just take fifth.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.586
Maybe it was your destiny
To meet each other because had.

41:17.620 --> 41:21.827
It not been for the "Amazing
Race," you would never have.

41:21.862 --> 41:23.793
Become fun-stoppable.

41:23.827 --> 41:25.827
That's true.

41:25.862 --> 41:27.222
There's nothing else to explain
It.

41:27.246 --> 41:31.137
It sucks to lose but we have
More to be grateful for than to.

41:31.172 --> 41:31.862
Be sad about.

41:31.896 --> 41:36.000
We made it to the mat this time.

41:36.034 --> 41:38.448
We're some of the luckiest
People in the world that we got.

41:38.482 --> 41:39.586
To live our dream.

41:39.620 --> 41:42.896
Not just our dream but our
Delusional childhood dream.

41:42.931 --> 41:46.172
Twice.

41:46.206 --> 41:49.965
Today team fun wasn't quite so
Wise, a cracked egg was our.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.068
Demise but it's ok, we'll still
Be positive people and show the.

41:53.103 --> 41:56.793
World this is how you ka-jeeple.

41:56.827 --> 41:57.344
Dang it.

41:57.379 --> 42:04.655
That was a good line.

42:17.862 --> 42:18.862
Our next episode.

42:23.551 --> 42:26.413
Next time on the season
Finale of "The amazing race."

42:26.448 --> 42:28.827
getting down to the
Nitty-gritty.

42:28.862 --> 42:30.142
The final four give it
Their all.

42:30.166 --> 42:32.655
We're here for our Redemption.

42:32.689 --> 42:36.448
We would love for an all
"Amazing race" final three.

42:36.482 --> 42:41.517
As they battle to win the
One million dollars and "The."

42:41.551 --> 42:42.137
