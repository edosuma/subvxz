WEBVTT

00:06.520 --> 00:09.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:12.160 --> 00:15.120
It doesn't make sense
that your grandparents

00:15.200 --> 00:18.280
would hide the fact
that Ron met your mom here.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.520
There must be something else.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.040
I don't know what.
My mom isn't even in the hotel registry.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.520
It's just like I said.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.280
My dad must've had a relationship

00:31.280 --> 00:32.200
with your mother.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.680
Then that means…

00:39.840 --> 00:40.680
your dad…

00:45.480 --> 00:47.480
Do you really think we could be sisters?

00:47.560 --> 00:48.400
Luz,

00:50.320 --> 00:53.160
to have the exact same birthmark
in the same place

00:53.240 --> 00:56.200
doesn't feel like just
a coincidence to me, honestly.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.040
What?

01:05.280 --> 01:06.760
Not that it would be so bad.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.560
Being sisters?

01:16.400 --> 01:19.400
And you think… maybe

01:20.040 --> 01:21.880
Paula wrote you this letter

01:23.240 --> 01:24.240
because of this?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.720
But if she had more information,

01:28.320 --> 01:30.440
why wouldn't she have told you
about this sooner?

01:32.280 --> 01:35.640
Well, it's possible she didn't have
all the information at the time.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.360
Maybe she knew that my dad
and grandparents were keeping

01:40.440 --> 01:44.080
some kind of secret,
but didn't know exactly what it could be.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.040
It's late.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.920
And you're still weak.
You should get some sleep.

01:57.000 --> 01:57.920
Sleep?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.880
You're funny.
I don't even remember what sleep is.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.720
I don't wanna hear it.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.080
You need to rest.
Tomorrow you'll feel a lot better,

02:08.160 --> 02:10.160
and things will look much clearer.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.800
Thanks so much, Luz.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.960
Nati, it's so good.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.880
Yeah, the last part you added
made it special.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.320
You are a hit machine.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.840
<i>We are</i> a hit machine.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.240
Ooh!

03:28.640 --> 03:29.800
Yeah!

03:30.640 --> 03:32.640
Mmm!

03:41.320 --> 03:43.560
-Hmm.
-What do you think, Doctor?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.520
You're much better, Steffi.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.640
-Your reflexes are great.
-Yes!

03:47.720 --> 03:50.680
Your progress shows
that you are almost fully recovered.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.680
-That's great.
-Perfect. So, can she go back to training?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.360
Not so fast. I haven't finished my exam.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.280
Let's see.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.280
Do you remember what you were doing
right before the fall?

04:02.800 --> 04:04.200
-Not much.
-Hmm.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.600
Actually, nothing at all.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.960
I don't even remember
going to train that day.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.440
Okay. That's very common.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.800
When a person gets hit really hard
on the head like in Steffi's case,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.280
it's normal to not remember
what happened before the injury.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.560
-Does that mean she isn't better?
-She is. She's much better.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.920
But she needs one more day of rest.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Then, if she doesn't have any pain,

04:25.080 --> 04:27.200
she can go back
to physical activity, okay?

04:27.800 --> 04:28.640
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.720
Well, then, time for breakfast.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.080
Excellent.
A good breakfast is the best medicine.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.800
-I'll go with you.
-Sure.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.680
Well, it looks to me like Steffi
has practically recovered.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.760
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.040
But we lost an entire day of training,
which is not ideal.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.200
I think we might still might have
one more card up our sleeve.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.000
What card?

04:57.520 --> 04:58.800
Well, a drone.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.320
Ian has a drone.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.920
Steffi still hasn't seen
the Northern Channel.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.280
We could record it

05:04.360 --> 05:06.960
so she can visualize it
before the competition.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.000
That's a good idea.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.000
We don't have many other options.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.400
You take care of Steffi,
and I'll talk to Ian.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.200
-Hmm?
-Got it.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.880
Guys, come look.
Let me show you this before I forget.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.600
-It's great, right?
-Amazing.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.480
I'm not sure. I think
we could make it a little bit more fun.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.280
Yeah? I don't know. Maybe we could…

05:53.360 --> 05:54.200
Here, Nati.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.880
-Say "friend zone" over and over again.
-Okay.

05:57.960 --> 05:58.800
Watch this.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.280
Friend zone.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.920
Friend zone. Friend zone.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.800
-Friend zone.
-Yeah!

06:06.880 --> 06:09.680
-What are you laughing at?
-Look. Your lips.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.480
<i>Friend zone.</i>

06:12.000 --> 06:13.120
<i>Friend zone.</i>

06:13.200 --> 06:14.600
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.320
Maybe we could add in some butterflies.
I love butterflies.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.560
Butterflies around the river?
Does that make sense?

06:19.640 --> 06:23.400
So what? How come you can add sharks,
and I can't add butterflies?

06:23.480 --> 06:25.520
We could add penguins.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.680
-Julián.
-No?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.640
No, seriously.
Why can you add sharks in the river,

06:30.720 --> 06:32.680
and I can't add butterflies in the air?

06:32.760 --> 06:35.760
Hey, Nati,
you're getting really sensitive.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.600
No. I may be sensitive,

06:38.680 --> 06:41.520
but you're obtuse and don't know
how to listen to anyone else.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.440
-Obi-- Ob-- Obitus-- What?
-It's "obtuse."

06:46.520 --> 06:49.240
-Ah.
-Look. You have two options.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.680
One, don't apologize.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.320
Or two, understand you've made a mistake
and say "I'm sorry," dude.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.080
-I think it's the second.
-Thank you, Julián. Thanks.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.840
Mental note, don't argue with writers,
because whether or not they're right,

07:02.920 --> 07:05.000
they'll always use a word
you don't know against you.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.600
But you gotta look on the bright side.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.000
With Nati, you're already
out of the friend zone

07:09.080 --> 07:10.880
and went straight into the nothing zone.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.880
Do we have to do this right now?

07:22.960 --> 07:25.560
I was gonna film
another collaboration with the twins.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.160
Hey, calm down, Mr. Influencer.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.240
You'll have plenty of time to do that
once we get back, okay?

07:32.760 --> 07:35.560
What could be more important
than helping your sister?

07:35.640 --> 07:39.000
-Keeping my followers happy?
-Followers come and go all the time.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.920
You only have one sister.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.560
Well, then it's too bad
I don't have two sisters.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.560
Hey. Seriously, dude. Come on.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.920
Your sister lost
an entire day of training,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
and we desperately need to make up
for the lost time.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.040
This could be our last chance
to catch up to Natasha.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.640
I'm not sure how
you can catch up from so far away.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.960
We're here with Tony,
Steffi Navarro's coach,

08:01.040 --> 08:03.280
<i>who just caught us up on the situation.</i>

08:03.360 --> 08:05.840
Unfortunately,
Steff is very depressed right now.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.560
But seriously, my whole team and I,
hope she gets better very, very soon.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.840
We're also here
with her little brother, Ian.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.880
How depressed <i>is</i> Steffi?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.960
I really don't understand
how you can be so nasty all the time.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.000
I heard that Steffi lost her memory.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.960
If you need help
with wakeboarding classes,

08:24.040 --> 08:25.440
you can count on me.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.760
We already checked
the Northern Channel yesterday.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.000
Today we're training in the rapids.
And you guys just got started.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.720
I'm sorry.
You just don't possibly stand a chance.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.160
So, let's go over
what we know one more time.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.600
Paula wrote you a letter saying

08:49.680 --> 08:51.760
there's a secret at Cielo Grande.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.160
Ron, your dad,

08:54.760 --> 08:56.280
tells you he met Lyn,

08:57.040 --> 08:59.360
your mother, here at Cielo,

08:59.440 --> 09:01.800
and that the big secret is
that your grandparents told you

09:01.880 --> 09:03.360
an entirely different story.

09:04.480 --> 09:09.040
But that doesn't seem to be true.
Based on everything we know so far,

09:09.120 --> 09:11.200
Lyn never came to Cielo Grande.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.240
We should make absolutely sure
your mom was never here at the hotel.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.040
But we already know that for sure.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.760
Look. Here are all the records.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.800
See this?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.360
-Yeah.
-I can't open it.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.680
Yeah. No, no.
We can't open it on your laptop.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.680
We have to do it from the hotel computer.

09:36.680 --> 09:41.280
It's possible your grandparents
or somebody else maybe deleted Lyn.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.040
But if someone was deleted,
they'd still be in the backup system.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.600
Let's check?

09:48.560 --> 09:51.440
Look for Ordóñez.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.560
Francisco Ordóñez,
Sebastián, Miguel, but no Lyn.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.960
Mm.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.440
Who's my little sheep?
Who's my little sheep?

10:06.520 --> 10:07.680
Look what I brought you.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.880
-Let's brush those curls of yours.
-Sorry. No, not now.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.920
I can't, my little goat. I'm sorry.

10:14.120 --> 10:14.960
Ah.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.360
Okay. I see. I'm a bother.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.280
You're no sheep. You're a dog. Bye.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.280
Confirmed.
Lyn Ordóñez didn't exist in the backup.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.400
So you're telling me
she was never at Cielo Grande?

10:30.480 --> 10:32.920
Yeah, she does exist.
If she didn't, I wouldn't be here.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.160
Okay. Obviously right.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.920
We have to go to the city.
Noda, your car is still at the dock, yeah?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.160
Uh…

10:41.240 --> 10:43.280
Yes. Yes. Now?

10:43.360 --> 10:45.400
-Yes, now.
-No. I don't think that's a good idea.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.480
No. You know that I can't leave
the desk unattended.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.840
This is an emergency.
We have to go talk to my mom.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.320
We'll see you at the dock in ten minutes.
Let's go, Steffi.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.280
No, no, this can't happen.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.160
Bird has left the nest.
I repeat, bird has left the nest.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.360
Oh, oh.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.720
Oh.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.120
Let me help you, Nati.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.040
-I was just thinking--
-No, thank you. I can do it alone.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.480
I know you can, Nati.
I just wanted to help.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.040
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.760
Come on.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.280
Well, I may have been a little too harsh.
I didn't mean to be.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.440
-No, I was. I was being "obituse--"
-Obtuse!

12:01.520 --> 12:05.240
Obtuse. Yes, that and much more.
But I'm sorry, Nati.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.960
The most important thing for me
is that we're good.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.840
-Because we're good, right?
-Mm-hmm.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.560
Good. That's what I like to hear. Yes!

12:12.640 --> 12:15.080
I knew you'd be okay
with taking out the butterflies--

12:15.160 --> 12:18.240
Take them out? I don't get it.
I thought we were putting them in.

12:18.840 --> 12:19.680
No.

12:20.280 --> 12:24.120
No, Nati. I… I sent you the meme
so you could see that they look horrible.

12:25.000 --> 12:25.840
Okay.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.520
Well, now
we're definitely not good, Carlos.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.800
So, what's the plan?
What should we say?

12:42.040 --> 12:43.960
It's a sensitive subject.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.120
How about we just tell her,

12:47.960 --> 12:50.000
tell her we think we're half sisters

12:50.080 --> 12:53.320
and that we think she's the one
who can help us finish the story.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.400
You mean just like that?

12:56.640 --> 13:00.400
Well, maybe it's better
if we go a little slower

13:00.480 --> 13:02.080
and then see what she says.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.080
Right, but I don't think

13:04.160 --> 13:06.880
that should be the first thing
we tell her when we get there.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.480
Just follow my lead.
I know how to talk to her.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.360
Every time I ask about my dad,
she gets defensive.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.160
"He never loved you."

13:15.240 --> 13:18.240
"It's his loss. Don't waste your energy."

13:18.320 --> 13:20.360
"Just pretend your dad doesn't exist."

13:21.440 --> 13:22.760
Now I understand why.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.160
-I'm a little nervous.
-Yeah, me too.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.720
I can't believe we might be sisters.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.880
And I can't believe my dad
cheated on my mom with your mom.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.800
This is where Steffi crashed?

13:48.640 --> 13:50.280
I don't get what happened here.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.640
Conditions on this river
aren't the same as the Northern Channel.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.560
It's wider and more exposed to the wind.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.960
Maybe it gets really rough.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.400
I think we should consider
getting to work on a different strategy.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.360
I still don't think
it was that complicated for her.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.160
I really don't get what happened.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.160
I expected more from her.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.720
If I had a sister,
my mom would've told me a long time ago.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.920
I don't think she knows anything.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.920
And my dad would've told me
that he met my mom at Cielo Grande,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.520
but here we are.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.160
All of this feels like a dream.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.680
But luckily, we have each other.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.240
That's good.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.400
-Is this your mother?
-Yeah.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.960
She's pretty.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.480
What a lovely house you have.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.880
-Thanks.
-Amazing.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.800
Luz, come here.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.520
I have a photo just like this
from when I was little.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.680
-Seriously?
-Yeah. I think I have it here.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.240
Ah!

15:52.040 --> 15:53.680
See? It's the same.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.880
I know it's impossible, but

16:02.880 --> 16:04.080
I feel as if

16:04.920 --> 16:06.280
I've already been here.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.480
This place reminds me of something.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.560
I don't know. Might be my imagination.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.920
Hey, boss, alert.
Squirrel in the red zone. Super red.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.120
Awaiting instructions.

16:35.000 --> 16:35.840
Here?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.200
Yeah, here is good.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.000
Steffi was never able
to practice here, you know?

16:42.640 --> 16:46.280
She doesn't know this part of the river.
She doesn't know the conditions out here.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.160
So I'd love to record
some specialized routes for her,

16:49.240 --> 16:51.120
so she can try and visualize
her technique.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.160
-Okay?
-Done.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.560
I hope you guys can make up for lost time.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.640
Come on. We can use your drone
and follow the wake of the boat.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.520
Let me know when you're ready.
I'll guide you.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.560
It looks easy.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.280
Well, the drone part, at least.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.320
All right, then.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.360
What we really want
is to get a clear image

17:10.440 --> 17:13.880
from Steffi's point of view,
right behind the boat,

17:13.960 --> 17:16.920
so she can visualize the route
as though she were on the water.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.560
-Ready?
-Let's go.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.920
Let's go, Pedro. Hit it.

17:38.440 --> 17:42.400
This is my fourth birthday.
She bought me this buckle, that I loved.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.000
-I thought I was so cool.
-It looked really great on you.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.440
Yeah. Yeah.
Ah! This is my aunt and Miss Ruli…

17:49.480 --> 17:51.760
-Hi.
-Luz.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.400
-Hi, Mom.
-What a surprise. Hi.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.360
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, totally fine. Everything's fine.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.480
Oh, good.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.200
This is Steffi,
a friend of mine from Cielo Grande.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.640
-Hi.
-Hi, Steffi. Welcome.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.600
Thank you.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.720
It's so nice to see you.
Well, you're staying for lunch?

18:10.360 --> 18:12.760
-Yeah.
-Good. Come on, then.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.080
Sorry.
Um, I just don't feel inspired.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.880
Nati, that was amazing.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.120
Could we possibly leave it for later?

18:52.200 --> 18:56.120
Yeah, whatever you want,
but it's your song.<i> </i>We need you.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.120
Thanks.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.440
At least there's <i>someone</i>
who appreciates me.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.840
Nati, who said
I don't appreciate you?

19:03.920 --> 19:07.200
Me not liking your butterfly idea
doesn't mean I don't appreciate you.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.840
Guys, this song only needs
a couple more rehearsals.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.040
-We're wasting time arguing.
-Yes, I agree.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.280
But there's only one person
who is making us waste time.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.560
Fine.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.080
If you don't need my help,
let me know, and I'll just leave.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.520
Charlie, we all need each other.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.680
No, we really don't need your help,
Charlie. Thanks so much.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.080
Perfect.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.640
Hey…

19:31.920 --> 19:36.320
Nati, you have to fix things with Charlie.
We can't continue like this.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.120
Ah! Just what I needed.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.880
Charlie doesn't know
how to work in a team,

19:39.960 --> 19:41.640
and I'm the one who has to fix things?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to perform
as a solo artist.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.360
I loved the surprise,
and I'm happy you're here,

19:56.440 --> 19:59.840
but I could've made something special
if I knew you were coming.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.040
It was just a last-minute decision,
and this is nice.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.640
-I miss the two of us cooking together.
-Ah.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.640
I've been working a lot with Steffi.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.760
-She's going to compete in Summer Crush.
-Oh wow!

20:11.840 --> 20:14.600
She's amazing.
And one of the top five in the world.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.360
Top five.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.560
Right now,
I feel like I'm in the bottom five.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.840
Ah, don't stress out.
It's not about winning or losing.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.960
What's important is the experience.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.720
Mm-hmm. Right, Mom.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.040
And you know, the best trophy isn't
always the one you take with you.

20:37.640 --> 20:41.000
Let's go. Nice.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.680
Oh.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.600
Mm, all right.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.160
I almost starved to death.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.360
Come on. Let's go find Steffi.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.040
I want to show her the videos.
She's gonna love the footage we got.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.720
Okay. Hey, why don't we go to her room
and watch the footage with her.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.720
This is great material
for the next time she trains.

21:02.680 --> 21:03.560
Thank you, Ian.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.400
You definitely helped us
make up for lost time.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.880
Awesome.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.440
THE LAST THING I WANT TO TELL YOU
BEFORE I SAY GOODBYE…

21:54.200 --> 21:57.440
DEAR STEFFI, I'LL PROBABLY BE GONE
BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS…

22:17.520 --> 22:20.640
I need you to get Steffi out of there
and bring her back to Cielo Grande.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Do whatever it takes.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.320
Steffi?

22:34.960 --> 22:36.520
Steffi?

22:37.120 --> 22:37.960
Steffi?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.040
-Steffi?
-Steffi?

22:58.320 --> 22:59.920
"Mom."

23:01.280 --> 23:03.120
"YourMom86."

23:04.600 --> 23:06.400
"NoDa86."

23:07.440 --> 23:09.040
Ugh!

23:13.160 --> 23:15.560
What do you want?

23:16.080 --> 23:19.600
-Mm. Where's Noda?
-That's what I'd like to know as well.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.600
Apparently, he's out and about
and he'll "be back later."

23:24.640 --> 23:26.000
And have you seen Steffi?

23:27.160 --> 23:30.720
The last time I saw your precious Steffi,
she was with Luz and Noda.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.120
And where are they now?

23:33.200 --> 23:34.840
I don't know
where they are now. Okay?

23:34.920 --> 23:37.480
I've been on the case
since the very opening of Sky Vibes.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.240
And I know for sure
they're up to something.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.960
Ah, yeah. Yeah, I heard them say
they're getting together to rob a bank.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.480
Either way, I'm sure
they couldn't have gotten too far.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.440
We're surrounded by water.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.680
Whatever.

23:54.760 --> 23:58.400
But if you see Noda, you tell him
that I'm waiting here, and I'm not moving.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.080
Mm-hmm.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.360
Do you know the password?

24:08.560 --> 24:10.120
Thanks.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.840
I'm sorry.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.920
I'd erased that memory,
and hearing it from you really got to me.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.800
So it's true.
You did meet my dad at Cielo Grande?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.920
Uh, yes.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.400
-Who's that?
-I'll get it. Who is it?

24:38.480 --> 24:40.160
-Noda!
-What? It's Noda.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.320
-Wait, what?
-Sorry.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.320
It's an emergency. Cielo Grande's on fire.
We have to go now.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.880
-What?
-It's on fire.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.920
Guys,
it's sounding super dope.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.760
And when we add the music to go with it,
it'll be crazy.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.560
I trust you, guys.
I can't wait to hear it.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.240
-What about the video?
-Oh, that's still in progress.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.400
It looks like we have a little problem
with butterflies and sharks.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.240
Yeah, Nati just keeps insisting
on butterflies,

25:45.320 --> 25:47.000
and it doesn't make sense.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.640
And sharks do make sense
just because you like them?

25:49.720 --> 25:52.080
You didn't even listen
to Nati's idea, Charlie.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.280
You could at least try to see her point.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.400
Have you seen Steffi?

25:57.520 --> 26:00.240
-Wasn't she resting?
-I went to her room, and it was empty.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.400
Funny thing is I can't find Luz either,
and I left her in charge of Steffi.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.520
-Now I don't know where they are.
-Weird. They're not answering messages?

26:07.120 --> 26:09.120
-No.
-Maybe they're at the river training.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.320
But she was resting. She couldn't have.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.360
There's no sign of Noda either.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.640
Squirrel en route.
I repeat, squirrel en route.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.600
What?

26:21.680 --> 26:22.960
For Matrix.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.600
All this effort to save Cielo,
and now it's on fire. I can't believe it.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.600
-No way.
-No.
