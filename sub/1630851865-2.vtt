00:32.680 --> 00:37.360
Oops! Sorry.
I'm just so excited about my birthday.

00:37.519 --> 00:40.640
And when I get excited, I get slippery!

00:42.160 --> 00:43.160
Whoa!

00:43.800 --> 00:46.919
Wow. You sure do!
[weak chuckle]

00:47.040 --> 00:48.800
Oh! I'll get the glasses!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.440
Hmm.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.760
Hi, Ollie! Ready to go buy
Stanley's birthday present

00:53.919 --> 00:56.080
and make him the happiest snail ever?

00:56.199 --> 00:58.480
-Yeah... About that...
-I just can't wait

00:58.640 --> 01:02.160
to get him that rare and
delicate snow-globe collection!

01:02.919 --> 01:03.959
Oops!

01:06.960 --> 01:08.119
[crash]

01:09.640 --> 01:10.960
[Stanley] Sorry!

01:13.160 --> 01:15.160
Ollie, I'm having second thoughts

01:15.320 --> 01:18.360
about giving Stanley
a super-breakable gift!

01:18.520 --> 01:19.920
Ah!

01:20.080 --> 01:23.240
But then how do we make Stanley
the happiest snail ever?

01:23.399 --> 01:26.320
-I'm having a brainstorm!
-Uh-oh.

01:26.479 --> 01:28.000
When you have a brainstorm,

01:28.160 --> 01:30.800
it usually means
I get dragged off somewhere.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.920
What if we gave Stanley a gift
you're supposed to break?

01:35.199 --> 01:38.720
What? What would you want
to break on purpose?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.960
That's impossible! That's...

01:41.119 --> 01:42.839
-A piñata!
-Perfect!

01:43.000 --> 01:44.640
I might even have one right here!

01:45.240 --> 01:48.839
Let's see...
Pickles, pillows, pimentos, pimpernels...

01:49.000 --> 01:51.600
Here we go! Piñata.

01:51.759 --> 01:53.800
But that one's already broken.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.160
No, Ollie, we have to get him a new piñata

01:59.320 --> 02:02.199
from where they've been
making piñatas forever!

02:02.679 --> 02:04.520
Uh... Will I need to pack?

02:04.640 --> 02:06.000
Stanley! Come on!

02:06.160 --> 02:09.799
We're going to celebrate
your birthday in Mexico!

02:11.160 --> 02:13.840
-Let's go!
-Yep. I need to pack.

02:20.359 --> 02:21.840
Whoo!

02:22.359 --> 02:23.840
Whee!

02:32.640 --> 02:37.799
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are now arriving in Mexico.</i>

02:39.640 --> 02:42.160
Best birthday ever!

02:42.519 --> 02:44.920
Stanley, you scout out a nice picnic spot.

02:45.079 --> 02:47.480
Moon and I will be right back
with a surprise!

02:47.600 --> 02:49.120
-Ha, ha!
-You're gonna love this!

02:49.280 --> 02:50.480
He's gonna love this!

02:50.920 --> 02:52.519
Whoo!

02:52.840 --> 02:54.799
[gasps]
Do you see what I see, Ollie?

02:54.959 --> 02:58.040
I sure do.
It's the perfect piñata for Stanley!

02:58.679 --> 03:00.160
<i>Hola</i>. May I help you?

03:00.280 --> 03:03.560
Oh! <i>Hola.</i>
Yes, we were hoping to buy the...

03:03.679 --> 03:05.160
-Cheese wedge!
-Unicorn!

03:05.320 --> 03:07.840
-Huh?
-I'm sorry. Which one?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.359
-The unicorn!
-The cheese wedge!

03:10.320 --> 03:12.840
Stanley loves yellow
and the cheese wedge is yellow.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.880
But Stanley loves smiley faces even more

03:16.040 --> 03:19.600
and the unicorn
has the smiliest face ever!

03:19.880 --> 03:21.799
-Yellow!
-Smiley face!

03:22.440 --> 03:24.519
[kerching] Hmm.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.320
Uh... what did we just buy?

03:27.440 --> 03:32.399
A smiling yellow piñata?
I love it! Mmm! Oops!

03:32.519 --> 03:35.040
Ha! We knew you'd drop it right away!

03:35.679 --> 03:38.880
Now we can all enjoy the treats
from inside the piñata

03:39.040 --> 03:40.760
since it's...

03:40.920 --> 03:42.679
not broken? Hmm.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.440
-Try again, Stanley.
-Oops!

03:46.119 --> 03:47.200
Ugh... Ha!

03:48.200 --> 03:50.280
-Oh, man!
-Grr!

03:52.640 --> 03:54.119
Oops!

03:54.239 --> 03:55.239
Yaa!

03:55.480 --> 03:58.200
Why won't you break open?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.799
Argh! Why won't it break?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.079
I don't know, but don't worry, Stanley.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.799
We're going to get this thing open,

04:15.959 --> 04:18.920
and you are going to have
the best birthday ever!

04:19.279 --> 04:20.880
You know, all this talk about treats

04:21.039 --> 04:23.120
has got me pretty hungry,
so maybe we could...

04:23.280 --> 04:25.120
Ah-ha! This should do it!

04:25.280 --> 04:26.479
[drilling]

04:27.120 --> 04:28.360
Shh!

04:32.640 --> 04:33.719
Shh!

04:36.120 --> 04:38.919
Shh! I'm trying to take a <i>siesta</i>.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.599
-You mean nap?
-He naps?

04:41.800 --> 04:46.280
A lot of Mexicans do. So, shh!
OK? <i>Gracias.</i>

04:46.680 --> 04:50.080
-But I'm shh-ing already!
-Use your quiet shh, Moon.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.120
This is my quiet shh.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.960
[yells]
This is my normal shh!

04:55.080 --> 04:59.039
If you can't shh, then can you
at least leave, <i>por favor</i>?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.120
That's it!

05:05.760 --> 05:07.120
[groaning]

05:09.800 --> 05:12.880
Did you notice this is the worst
and hottest time of the day

05:13.039 --> 05:15.240
ever in the history
of weather and daytime?

05:15.400 --> 05:18.760
Did you notice the <i>siesta</i>
is starting to make sense now?

05:21.680 --> 05:24.159
[groaning]

05:33.599 --> 05:35.240
Hey, look! We made it!

05:35.400 --> 05:38.320
Nothing could survive a trip
down these stairs.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.440
As soon as Stanley gets here,
you let go of the piñata and...

05:43.599 --> 05:46.359
Me? Don't you have the piñata?

05:46.479 --> 05:47.719
-Stanley?
-Uh-oh!

05:47.880 --> 05:49.440
Watch out!

05:52.039 --> 05:54.120
Ah!

05:54.280 --> 05:56.960
My beautiful piñata!
I can't believe it missed me.

05:57.359 --> 05:59.359
I can't believe it didn't break!

05:59.520 --> 06:01.800
And I can't believe
naptime is already over.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.880
Ah!

06:09.479 --> 06:11.080
Look! A food truck!

06:11.200 --> 06:12.800
Who's up for a snack?

06:13.120 --> 06:17.520
Yum! They have lime soup
and <i>poblanos </i>and enchiladas...

06:17.680 --> 06:19.680
Uh-oh. Watch out for the... !

06:19.840 --> 06:21.919
Oh! It's so gonna break now!

06:26.640 --> 06:27.799
Hmm.

06:29.479 --> 06:30.599
Hmm?

06:32.400 --> 06:33.799
You gotta be kidding me.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.000
Oh, Stanley. You must be so disappointed.

06:37.159 --> 06:39.039
Yes, but not in the way you think. See...

06:39.200 --> 06:43.320
Don't give up. We are going
to get this piñata open for you.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.159
-Best birthday ever!
-Best birthday ever!

06:47.520 --> 06:50.080
We've got to get this piñata open somehow!

06:51.960 --> 06:53.039
Hey!

06:53.799 --> 06:54.880
Ha, ha!

06:59.640 --> 07:00.719
Let's ask him!

07:00.840 --> 07:04.080
Yeah, with an outfit like that,
he must be a guy who knows stuff!

07:04.760 --> 07:06.919
<i>Señor</i>, can you help us?

07:07.039 --> 07:11.840
Do you how to... Pshh!
You know, break this open?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.640
-Hmm.
-Huh?

07:14.560 --> 07:15.479
What's he doing?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.599
Heh, heh!

07:19.120 --> 07:22.000
I dunno.
But it's a great drawing, isn't it, Ollie?

07:22.159 --> 07:23.799
[cheering]

07:23.919 --> 07:26.440
Folks do seem to be interested in it.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.960
Wait a second.
He's a wrestler, Ollie! A <i>luchador!</i>

07:40.120 --> 07:41.560
That's why the get-up!

07:41.719 --> 07:45.080
He's gonna wrestle our piñata
and totally break it open!

07:45.200 --> 07:48.479
Come on. How's he supposed
to wrestle a piñata?

07:49.760 --> 07:50.960
[battle cry]

07:54.880 --> 07:56.039
Oh, that's how.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.200
Oh, wow! Yeah!

08:01.120 --> 08:02.320
[laughs]

08:05.239 --> 08:07.919
I can't believe Stanley's missing this.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.599
Oh, I just hope he's not too... too sad.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.159
Mmm. [munching]

08:15.320 --> 08:18.520
Slow down, <i>muchacho!</i>
Those chillies are spicy!

08:18.679 --> 08:20.400
They have a grande afterburn.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.640
They seem OK to me,
and I'm so hungry that...

08:24.280 --> 08:25.400
Uh-oh.

08:25.919 --> 08:27.599
[screams]

08:27.760 --> 08:29.440
Happens every time.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.679
Oh...

08:37.360 --> 08:38.640
Argh...

08:40.760 --> 08:43.120
[cheering]

08:43.280 --> 08:46.760
-Piñata! Piñata! Piñata!
-It won. Our piñata won.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.720
Poor Stanley! He's going to be so upset!

08:49.880 --> 08:52.199
That's it. Time to talk toucan.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.560
<i>Hola! </i>Enjoying your piñata?

08:56.720 --> 08:57.800
Enjoying?

08:57.959 --> 09:00.600
<i>Señor</i>, our friend's birthday is ruined!

09:00.760 --> 09:03.319
You've sold us a defective piñata!

09:03.480 --> 09:05.840
It won't break no matter what we try!

09:06.000 --> 09:09.400
I should hope not, since it's <i>irrompible</i>.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.040
-That means unbreakable.
-Unbreakable?

09:12.160 --> 09:16.439
<i>Si. </i>Says so right on the bottom.
Guaranteed not to break.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.959
-What?
-Argh!

09:19.160 --> 09:20.199
[both sigh]

09:20.360 --> 09:22.000
What are we going to do, Ollie?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.160
This is gonna break Stanley's heart!

09:24.319 --> 09:26.199
It'll make him the saddest snail ever!

09:27.280 --> 09:29.199
[sighs]
We better tell him.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.760
Stanley, we...

09:32.920 --> 09:34.959
uh... well...

09:35.160 --> 09:36.839
-Hmm?
-We've ruined your birthday.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.160
We bought you an unbreakable piñata

09:39.360 --> 09:43.319
and we'll never, ever, ever
get the treats out of it.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.040
It must be the worst thing
that's ever happened to you!

09:46.199 --> 09:48.839
-We're so sorry!
-No big deal.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.439
You are so brave. He is so brave.

09:52.600 --> 09:57.319
But it's OK to be sad, Stanley.
Let it out. Let it all out.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.199
But I'm not sad. No matter
how excited and slippery I get,

10:01.400 --> 10:02.680
I can never break your gift!

10:02.839 --> 10:04.800
Which means I get to keep it always!

10:04.959 --> 10:06.439
-Oh!
-Hey!

10:06.600 --> 10:08.439
I never thought of it that way.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.920
I've been trying to tell you all day.

10:11.079 --> 10:14.560
Apart from being a bit hungry,
I'm the happiest snail ever!

10:14.959 --> 10:16.600
That's all we ever wanted.
