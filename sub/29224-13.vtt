Sorry.

I bust my ass for this family,

01:55.031 --> 01:56.282
and this is what you do?

02:00.954 --> 02:04.124
- Answer me!
- What? What answer do you want?

02:04.666 --> 02:05.666
Is it true?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.169
What they're saying?

02:11.005 --> 02:13.341
- What are they saying?
- You damn well know.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.054
They're saying you assaulted a kid.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.640
That you sexually assaulted a kid.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.474
A boy.

- That true?
- No, it wasn't sexual assault.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.020
I was messing with him.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.107
You were messing with him?

02:30.650 --> 02:31.650

At the minimum.

You got one on me, Jensen.
I've never had one of those.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.881
Yeah, I'm breaking your records
all the time.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.792
It's brutal,
but it's better than a jail cell.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.210
We had to agree to it

04:12.293 --> 04:15.338
to get the prosecutor into court
this morning and get you RoR'd.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.274
- I'm not complaining.
- [Justin] So, what?

04:17.298 --> 04:20.027
- He can't leave the outhouse?
- [Mrs. Jensen] He's not on house arrest.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.344
It's a GPS unit.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.055
So, they can track him to school,
the library,

04:24.472 --> 04:25.723
wherever he's cleared to go.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.807
Wait, school?

04:26.849 --> 04:29.411
You have a meeting with the new counselor.
She'll do an evaluation

04:29.435 --> 04:31.980
and tell the school district
if you're okay to come back.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.773
Like, to see if I'm still homicidal?

04:34.607 --> 04:35.733
Enough with that talk.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.652
Okay? Your state of mind counts.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.570
Now, but especially at trial.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.864
What if it doesn't even go to trial?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.826
I mean, what if they come up
with new evidence or a new...

04:45.451 --> 04:46.452
a new witness?

04:46.536 --> 04:49.163
Is that why you went to see Seth Massey
the other night?

04:49.789 --> 04:50.790
I...

04:51.457 --> 04:52.457
Uh...

04:53.543 --> 04:55.795
- [stammering] I thought he could help.
- Unlikely.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.630
He was arrested on parole violations.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.549
He's going away for a long time.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.552
- How did you know that I was with him?
- They had detectives tailing you.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.429
You can assume they will
from now on.

05:04.887 --> 05:05.888
So, watch your back.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.266
Both of you.

School in ten.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.818
Fuck!

05:23.114 --> 05:26.034
I thought he could get rid of the dealer.
So I could be your alibi.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.873
I'm going to prison.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.583
For the rest of my life.

She was with Jess.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.106
Hey, Andrew. Walker crime scene,
what did we get for footprints?

05:57.774 --> 06:00.568
Not a lot. There was rain that weekend.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.696
So, we mostly had scuff marks

06:03.780 --> 06:04.822
from the struggle.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.534
Right, this here shows a limp, right?

06:09.118 --> 06:13.081
Yeah, which that Dempsey kid...
So, that answers that.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.002
Right, so the kid that was in the fight
here was dragging his right foot,

06:18.836 --> 06:20.046
like Zach would've.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.006
What about this one?

06:22.965 --> 06:25.134
Doesn't this show
a left foot being dragged?

06:25.468 --> 06:26.468
Yeah, possibly.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.763
Or maybe we're looking at it wrong.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.392
There's not one complete print.
I wouldn't take it to court.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.226
All right.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.854
What about tire treads?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.506
- [Amara] You were out again all night.
- Not all night.

in the window of the coffee shop

07:11.514 --> 07:12.765

07:13.141 --> 07:16.144
Yeah, Justin Foley was there, too.
We're all in the same history class.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.229
I will assume that is a lie.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.065
The police called this morning.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.109
- What?
- Deputy Standall.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.272
They want to see you again.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.112
I told them
we would be there this evening.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.696
I see.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.616
All right.

07:30.908 --> 07:35.163
- Amorowat, I told you not to get involved.
- Mum, I know. I know.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.166
But you brought me into this country,
and I'm glad you did,

07:38.249 --> 07:40.418
and now you have to let me live
in this country.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.088
And take care of my friends,
and my friends needed me last night.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.452
Did they also lie to the police?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.342
How can you be sure
this boy didn't commit the crime?

07:48.426 --> 07:50.094
Because I know him, Mum!

07:50.678 --> 07:51.678
And he's good.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.643
You mustn't lie to the police again.

to talk to me again.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.670
- Shit! Why?
- Does it matter?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.381
Look, I got an all-cash offer
to sell the garage

09:08.464 --> 09:10.692
- to the guy who owns Maverick's.
- What about the title?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.176
He's gonna file a new title himself,

09:12.260 --> 09:14.345
transfer it over to his holding company,
clean it up.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.056
- He's cool with it.
- Jesus, Tony. That's fraud.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.599
You're gonna talk to me about fraud?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.309
They have Clay for murder.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.936
Once they figure out he's innocent,

09:22.019 --> 09:24.059
- they're gonna work their way...
- How do you know?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.899
How do you know that he is innocent?

09:27.358 --> 09:30.236
- [scoffs]
- Tell me the truth about that night.

09:30.945 --> 09:31.945
About Homecoming.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.240
- I told you the truth.
- I...

09:35.449 --> 09:37.243
Shit! One second.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.326
You kidding?

09:39.203 --> 09:40.204
It's Tim Pozzi.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.624

I have to kick him out.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.430

10:24.373 --> 10:26.792
if returning to class
is the best thing for you.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.337
What makes you all think
I want to return?

10:30.379 --> 10:33.179
- You don't want to come back?
- What good has this place ever done me?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.468
What good has high school done anyone?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.679
I feel like all I've learned
these last few years is life is fucked.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.765
Don't try and help anyone.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.018
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Don't you?

10:44.101 --> 10:45.686
I mean, how do you do it?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.188
- Do what?
- Your job.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.231
How do you show up here every day

10:49.315 --> 10:52.902
hoping to make it better,
knowing nothing ever changes?

10:54.070 --> 10:57.406
Tyler Down told me the reason
he came to see me in the first place

10:57.615 --> 10:59.575
last spring was because of you.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.659
Is that true?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.329
I guess... I guess so. So what?

11:03.537 --> 11:05.665
So, you said things don't get better.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.086
But it does. And Tyler has,
in no small part because of you.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.466
Clay, you asked me how I do it.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.719
It's easy. I show up.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.889
Every day, I show up, no matter what.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.017
Good days or bad,
because that's all we can do.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.435
And that's all you can do.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.062
So...

11:30.022 --> 11:31.357
you think you can show up?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.241
- You told Clay?
- [Justin] Yeah.

11:40.324 --> 11:44.286
Yeah, I did. But listen,
there's something new that happened.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.370
Okay, me first.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.124
The police called me in again.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.918
They want to see me today.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.504
Shit.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.592
Come here.
You're gonna want to hear this...

11:59.427 --> 12:01.053
before you talk to the police.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.534
[Clay] <i>Jesus, Ani.</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:26.537
I know, but it can help
when I go to the sheriff.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.831
No, don't go down there. Don't do that!

12:28.914 --> 12:31.500
Clay, I promise I will figure this out.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.919
If I can't make things better,
I won't make it worse.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.045
Don't go down there.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.816
You may think you have a plan,
but you're jumping into it head first.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.360
- You're not listening to reason.
- Okay. First, I do have a plan.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.384
And second,

12:41.635 --> 12:45.055
are you really the person to criticize me
for being headstrong and stubborn?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.893
It's just, what if it doesn't work?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.645
Listen, I need you to hold up your end.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.607
A confession at this point fucks us up!

12:55.107 --> 12:56.400
- Right?
- No, I know.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.569
Clay, I've told you what you need to know.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.696
You can do this.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.116
You trust me, don't you?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.413
I... I trust you.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.333
[bell ringing]

13:31.685 --> 13:32.686
Sit right there.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.692
Can I get you some water or anything?

13:39.485 --> 13:40.486
No, thank you.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.321
I wasn't expecting you until later.

13:49.870 --> 13:50.870
Before we begin,

13:51.956 --> 13:53.916
if you're expecting I'm gonna help you

13:53.999 --> 13:56.544
prove Clay Jensen guilty,
you'll be disappointed.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.921
- 'Cause I don't believe he is.
- You don't?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.852
Just so you know,
you're facing the reality

14:01.882 --> 14:03.592
that most people believe
he is guilty.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.136
Do you still want to talk?

14:06.428 --> 14:07.428
I do.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.430
Okay.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.099
Do you mind?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.937
Okay. Begin at the beginning.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.148
Who you are, what school you're from
and why you're here.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.028

Justin told me you went to the sheriff.
You didn't have to do that.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.798
- Thank you.
- I didn't do it for you.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.141
I did it
because it was the right thing to do.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.200
Yeah, but sometimes it's hard
to know what the right thing is.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.390
Listen, Zach. Either way,

14:51.974 --> 14:53.976
you put yourself on the line.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.102
I'm gonna do the same.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.146
You deserve to know the truth.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.066
[Ani]
<i>Bryce Walker did hurt a lot of people.</i>

15:02.234 --> 15:03.569
Zach and Chloe, certainly.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.406
But I soon realized
the one he hurt the most

15:08.616 --> 15:09.658
was Jessica Davis.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.201
You wanna talk about Jessica Davis?

15:11.285 --> 15:13.329
You need to understand
everyone had their reasons.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.081
And you need to understand
what those reasons are.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.500
Everyone had a reason,

15:18.584 --> 15:20.586
- including you?
- Including me.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.004
But this isn't a confession?

15:22.087 --> 15:25.090
Before I tell you who did it,
and you decide what to do about it,

15:25.799 --> 15:27.718
you need to know who could've done it

15:27.801 --> 15:28.886
and why.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.448
- Okay, why do I need to know that?
- 'Cause no one's innocent.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.725
Violence begets violence,
it just doesn't always look the same.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.393
How do you mean?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.270
Some of us do violence to ourselves.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.940
Some try to break the pattern.
Zach tried.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.692
Maybe Bryce was trying
to break the cycle within himself.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.487
[Ani] <i>And Jessica found him
before he got the chance.</i>

15:47.404 --> 15:48.447
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.452
- Jess, seriously...
- Shh. No talking.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.703
No, this time I <i>am </i> talking.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.622
Okay? I do not have time to mess around.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.831
Yeah, okay. I know.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.211
I love you.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.754
And I'm scared.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.881
Hey. Don't be scared.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.968
Do you believe in me?

16:09.843 --> 16:12.346
- I mean, do you really believe in me?
- Yes.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.514
Of course I do.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.598
Then we're gonna be okay.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.273
[Ani] <i>Everyone had their reasons.</i>

16:23.857 --> 16:26.986
The trick was trying to tell
who just wanted Bryce dead,

16:27.486 --> 16:28.821
and who could actually kill.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.866
I mean, what does a killer look like?

16:34.159 --> 16:37.663
You know, I'm actually asking,
because... we had no idea.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.914
But you had your suspicions?

16:39.540 --> 16:42.209
Who among us would be most likely
to take a gun...

16:43.669 --> 16:44.753
and pull the trigger?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.053
Hey, man.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.137
Hey, Alex.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.642
Uh, Clay was looking for you.
I told him that you weren't in first.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.227
Yeah, I'm kinda skipping today.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.562
- Oh...
- But...

17:02.271 --> 17:05.607
I heard about Monty being arrested.
And what he did to you.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.026
Are you okay?

17:07.608 --> 17:08.608
I mean, yeah.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.739
That's really fucked up. I'm so sorry.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.281
Thanks.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.700
Listen, um...

17:17.828 --> 17:19.204
Do you still have a gun?

17:20.830 --> 17:21.832
No.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.752
The last one I gave Clay,
that was all I had.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.836
Why?

17:28.130 --> 17:31.675
No, I just... Just don't want
those guys to come after you.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.343
Monty's guys.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.929
Well, if they wanna go to jail...

17:36.597 --> 17:37.597
Right.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.684
What are you working on?

17:42.811 --> 17:43.812
Uh...

17:58.243 --> 17:59.453
Holy shit, Tyler.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.705
["All Your Life" playing]

18:01.997 --> 18:03.207
You took these as proof?

18:03.540 --> 18:04.540
Yeah.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.294
I only took one that first night.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.047
I thought I would leave it behind
as proof.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.091
And then, after that, I...

18:12.591 --> 18:14.510
I started to take one a day.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.886
Just to...

18:18.097 --> 18:20.224
like, track the bruises, I guess.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.352
I ended up tracking how I changed.

Okay, you're going to tell me why
I shouldn't go arrest Tyler right now.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.299
Well, because this conversation
would be over.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.354
And in a few minutes,
I'm going to tell you

19:37.426 --> 19:39.011
exactly why you can't go arrest Tyler.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.495
He was the only one who kept a gun?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.516

19:45.267 --> 19:46.427
He thought it made him a man.

it's physical therapy.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.451
- How're you gonna get there?
- My dad'll pick me up.

Your dad.
You're... you're gonna see your dad?

20:07.414 --> 20:09.666
Yeah, I just texted him.
He should be here soon. Why?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.168
Um...

20:13.337 --> 20:14.922
I just talked to Tyler.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.757
He told me you asked him for a gun.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.093
Yeah, I just needed
to blow off some steam.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.472
And I thought I'd do some target practice,
and my dad won't let me.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.724

But not from Bryce.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.139
Monty was buying from Bryce.

We didn't find anything on Monty.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.561
Does it surprise you
he might be a step ahead?

21:12.437 --> 21:14.481
Maybe your sheriff should have dug deeper.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.402
But you were all briefly convinced
you had your man in Tony Padilla.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.862
- Tony had a motive.
- He did.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.199

21:57.441 --> 21:58.441

22:01.695 --> 22:03.530
In retrospect,
this is probably a bad idea,

22:03.613 --> 22:07.743
but it's already set in motion,
so you're just gonna have to deal with it.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.495

You had tried to use Mr. Porter
and Mrs. Baker against him.

- But it worked the other way, didn't it?
- I think the sheriff

22:46.448 --> 22:47.866

22:47.949 --> 22:49.829
- by their interview.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.543

22:59.127 --> 23:00.796
Tyler Down was almost a school shooter,

23:01.213 --> 23:05.133
Tony Padilla's family was deported
because of Bryce Walker's family,

23:06.301 --> 23:08.595

with Bryce.

Well, of course you know
that Justin Foley's a drug addict?

You're the only one who can do it.
You're his friend.

Can I ask you something?

you're, like, a drug addict.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.043
<i>Bryce and Monty also had words
on the field?</i>

26:17.117 --> 26:18.368
[Zach] Go!

26:23.331 --> 26:25.584
- [grunting]
- [whistle blowing]

26:26.209 --> 26:29.421
- Hey! Hey, that was fucking late!
- Says the king of the cheap shot!

26:29.504 --> 26:31.584
- I'll break you if I have to.
- Go right ahead, man.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.136
[Zach] Come on, Luke.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.054
- [player] Get ready.
- [player 2] Let's go.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.682
[indistinct shouting]

26:43.518 --> 26:47.022
[Ani] <i>Monty spent the whole night
literally trying to break Bryce in half.</i>

26:49.065 --> 26:50.150
[whistle blowing]

26:52.027 --> 26:54.112
- Good hit, Monty.
- Keep coming, Walker.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.115
- Think you'll scare me?
- I'll fucking kill you.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.156
Okay, buddy.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.836
[Bryce]
<i>Listen, that thing we talked about.</i>

27:10.962 --> 27:13.298
You're all good.
Take care of yourself, man.

27:13.923 --> 27:14.923
[Monty] Walker!

27:18.511 --> 27:19.512
What's up, Monty?

27:20.430 --> 27:22.265
What the fuck are you trying to prove?

27:22.390 --> 27:24.710
I'm trying to prove
that I'm worth something in this world.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.143
You should try it.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.520
I gotta go.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.732
I will take you out.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.233
No, you won't.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.528
'Cause you're just a coward,
you always have been.

27:39.908 --> 27:44.204
Monty immediately got into his car
and followed the Hillcrest bus.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.248
[camera shutter clicking]

27:48.333 --> 27:49.459
The fuck are you doing here?

27:51.252 --> 27:52.252
Yearbook.

27:53.922 --> 27:58.134
I'm in Yearbook. I was just... I'm going.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.429
Hey. Hey... I ain't gonna do anything.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.348
I gotta go.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.183
Listen, man.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.062
I'm sorry about last summer.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.940
I was drunk, and really fucked up.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.900
It's fine.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.486
I mean, whatever.

28:18.905 --> 28:19.905
You...

28:20.990 --> 28:22.075
seem like a good guy.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.080
Um...

28:28.748 --> 28:30.333
You want...

28:31.543 --> 28:33.336
My parents are gone all weekend...

28:35.046 --> 28:36.046
if you want to hang out?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.885
[Ani] <i> Monty followed that bus
as soon as it left Liberty.</i>

28:44.472 --> 28:46.015
[grunting]

28:50.270 --> 28:51.730
[Monty moaning]

28:57.026 --> 28:58.027
Holy shit!

29:01.990 --> 29:03.867
Are you gonna beat the shit
out of me now?

29:04.909 --> 29:06.077
I said I was sorry.

29:08.538 --> 29:10.373
I know, I was just making a joke.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.837
I'll give you a ride somewhere
if you don't want to Uber.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.047
Are you trying to kick me out?

29:19.090 --> 29:20.925
No, I just figured you'd want to go.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.597
Well, maybe...

29:26.347 --> 29:27.724
I want to stay and do that again.

29:28.892 --> 29:29.892
Yeah?

29:30.518 --> 29:31.518
Okay.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.150
I'm not fucking gay.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.445
Okay.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.032
Cool.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.369
You can be whatever you want to be.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.248
No.

29:55.752 --> 29:56.752
I can't.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.256
[Ani] <i>Monty had a secret.</i>

30:01.466 --> 30:02.675
<i>Bryce knew what it was.</i>

30:04.677 --> 30:06.679
The secret being his assault on Tyler?

30:07.096 --> 30:08.932
- Yes.
- And that would drive Montgomery

30:09.015 --> 30:10.725
- to kill him?
- That, and a betrayal.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.103
He thought Bryce was his brother.

30:15.605 --> 30:16.815
No, Monty had an alibi.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.107
Talk to Charlie St. George.

30:19.734 --> 30:20.734
[Ani] <i>It won't hold up.</i>

30:22.487 --> 30:23.696
[sighing]

30:24.531 --> 30:25.698
So, you're telling me...

30:27.909 --> 30:29.744
You're telling me Montgomery de la Cruz?

30:30.370 --> 30:31.704
Process of elimination.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.917
<i>Jessica was home in bed.
Her dad tucked her in.</i>

30:36.125 --> 30:37.418
Okay, last message.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.756
I need you and I don't know
where the fuck you are, but I'm worried.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.134
I... I need you. Can you just...

30:46.427 --> 30:47.846
Can you please call me back?

31:06.573 --> 31:07.573
Hey!

31:07.824 --> 31:08.824
Hi, um...

31:09.534 --> 31:10.827
Could you sneak out right now?

31:11.202 --> 31:14.497
[Ani] <i> And while she was sleeping...
Justin was out getting high.</i>

31:16.207 --> 31:20.628
<i>He bought from a dealer named Halls,
out on the waterfront by Whitley Docks.</i>

31:21.004 --> 31:22.881
<i>He got blackout high right there.</i>

31:23.339 --> 31:24.632
We can check that.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.468
Whitley Dock is covered
with security cameras.

31:27.927 --> 31:28.927
Check it.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.627
I suppose they've got cameras
up and down the waterfront.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.244
Then you should look for Tony Padilla.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.729
He wasn't home in bed
with his boyfriend.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.648
<i>He was out waiting for a fixer.</i>

31:41.566 --> 31:44.444
<i>A guy who works for a local dealer
hooked into a Mexican cartel.</i>

31:45.028 --> 31:49.115
[speaking in Spanish]

31:55.455 --> 31:59.792
[speaking in Spanish]

31:59.876 --> 32:03.087

32:03.171 --> 32:05.673
[speaking in Spanish]

32:07.216 --> 32:08.384
[speaking in Spanish]

32:09.886 --> 32:11.095
Camarillo thinks I’m dealing.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.265
You tell him I'm dealing mufflers,
shocks and tires.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.059
He wants to talk to you.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.441
- Tell him I'm taking care of my family.
- Hey!

32:19.854 --> 32:22.190
- He wants to talk to you.
- What, like, now?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.362
Fuck me.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.549
[Standall] <i>You're telling me
that Tony was laundering drug money?</i>

32:32.825 --> 32:34.410
He was laundering garage money.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.496
Sending cash south to his family,

32:36.579 --> 32:38.998
because Bryce's lawyer
had ruined their lives.

32:39.832 --> 32:43.127
But Tony was two miles upriver
when Bryce died.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.631
- Any idea where my son was?
- Alex?

32:49.258 --> 32:52.428
Alex went out to meet Tyler,
not Jessica.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.015
<i>Alex knew Tyler was upset
after the fight.</i>

32:57.058 --> 32:58.643
<i>He didn't want you to know why.</i>

33:00.395 --> 33:01.729
<i>They met at Rosie's Diner.</i>

33:02.522 --> 33:03.648
And Clay Jensen?

33:04.691 --> 33:05.900
Clay Jensen was with me.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.529
He never told you
because he was protecting me.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.658
<i>I saw his car at the Chatham house.</i>

33:14.283 --> 33:15.952
<i>I told him we had to get out of there.</i>

33:16.953 --> 33:20.373
<i>I got in the car
and drove around with him all night.</i>

33:21.416 --> 33:22.417
Talking him down.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.085
And Monty followed Bryce?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.796
<i>Yes, Monty followed Bryce.</i>

33:27.296 --> 33:30.842
<i>But he saw Zach's car, so he waited
down at the end of the main pier.</i>

33:31.843 --> 33:32.969
[groaning]

33:35.930 --> 33:40.101
[Ani] <i>Monty saw Zach drive out of there,
headlights off. Fast.</i>

33:40.935 --> 33:42.478
<i>He waited another minute or two.</i>

33:42.979 --> 33:45.481
Then he drove down the pier
to confront Bryce.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.695
What the fuck are you doing here?

33:53.906 --> 33:54.991
What happened to you?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.164
Fucking Zach.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.641
Wow, he kinda beat the shit out of you.

34:04.834 --> 34:05.835
Why are you here?

34:08.504 --> 34:09.505
He's with me.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.884
Hey, Jess. You came.

34:12.967 --> 34:13.967
Yep.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.748
So, what did you want to give me?

34:17.263 --> 34:18.389
[groaning]

34:19.474 --> 34:20.475
I made you a tape.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.268
Is that some stupid fucking joke?

34:22.351 --> 34:23.686
No. No, no, no, no, no.

34:26.188 --> 34:28.149
Hang on. Hang on.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.152
[groaning with pain]

34:35.822 --> 34:36.822
Fuck!

34:46.667 --> 34:50.088
Fuck. Sorry, it's got...
There's some blood on the case.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.803
Here, please take it. Take it.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.604
- What's on it?
- A confession.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.565
And an apology.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.901
It owns up to everything I did.

35:12.401 --> 35:15.113
You can play it for whoever you want.
Or nobody.

35:15.446 --> 35:19.617
If you could maybe play it for Mrs. Baker,
though. She didn't want to talk to me.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.578
And that came as a surprise to you?

35:22.662 --> 35:24.288
I'm trying to set things right.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.751
I'm trying to be better,
but this fucking world won't let me.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.504
This world won't let you.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.173
What the fuck does that mean, Bryce?

35:34.674 --> 35:36.384
Nobody believes I can change.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.678
Clearly the fucking judge did.

35:40.847 --> 35:41.973
Wait, guys.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.183
[stammering] Guys, wait. Wait, please.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.351
I can't walk.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.147
I can't even stand up.
Can you help me get home?

35:49.438 --> 35:50.773
Or to a hospital?

35:50.857 --> 35:53.067
Why not sleep under the stars
and, you know,

35:53.568 --> 35:57.113
meditate on how hard it is
to get the world to let you change?

35:57.363 --> 35:58.906
Jess, please.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.242
Jess, wa... Alex. Alex!

36:01.325 --> 36:03.828
Guys, it's the middle of the fucking river
in November.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.956
It's gonna be fucking freezing tonight
and I'm wet,

36:07.081 --> 36:08.291
and I'm coughing blood.

36:08.958 --> 36:12.044
- Jess.
- If we help him, Zach goes to jail.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.006
If we leave him and he freezes to death,
Zach definitely goes to jail.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.758
For fuck's sake, you guys. Please!

36:18.426 --> 36:22.346
Please, I don't want to die out here.
Alex! Alex, please.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.890
Come on, we were... we were friends.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.527
We were never friends.

36:38.863 --> 36:39.863
Here.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.993
[Ani] <i>Monty's conscience stirred

36:44.619 --> 36:46.037
[Bryce yelling]

36:49.081 --> 36:51.209
[Ani] <i>But Bryce was in a fury of pain.</i>

36:52.793 --> 36:53.793
[Bryce screaming]

36:54.337 --> 36:55.337
Fucking Zach!

36:55.755 --> 36:58.466
I'm gonna fuck up his other knee
and wreck his fucking life!

36:58.549 --> 37:00.384
You're not going to do anything to Zach.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.094
I'm gonna fucking destroy him!

37:03.346 --> 37:05.181
You! You set me up!

37:05.264 --> 37:06.557
She did not set you up!

37:06.641 --> 37:07.725
She fucking set me up!

37:09.810 --> 37:11.687
[Ani] <i>And in that moment, helping him up,</i>

37:11.771 --> 37:13.564
<i>Monty looked into his eyes.</i>

37:14.148 --> 37:15.900
You've hurt everyone I ever loved.

37:16.442 --> 37:20.112
[Ani] <i>Monty realized that
the cycle had to be broken somehow.</i>

37:21.405 --> 37:22.740
Alex, what the fuck?

37:22.823 --> 37:25.826
[Ani] <i>And all those years
of being manipulated, all the rage,</i>

37:26.577 --> 37:28.246
<i>the hurt, burst out of him.</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:30.456
Shit!

37:31.707 --> 37:32.833
Alex!

37:34.877 --> 37:37.046
Alex, fuck! Help!

37:39.382 --> 37:40.716
Help me! I can't...

38:40.026 --> 38:40.901
I love you.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.153
You can't say that.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.239
You can't say that ever again.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.367
We have to stay apart.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.621
[Ani] <i>Monty drove home alone,</i>

38:53.581 --> 38:56.042
<i>knowing he would have to live
with what he's done.</i>

38:56.751 --> 38:59.128
So, let's go through
how you know what you know.

38:59.962 --> 39:03.507
First, Bryce and Monty's interaction
during the game

39:03.591 --> 39:04.717
and at the team bus.

39:04.842 --> 39:08.095
I told you, I pay attention. I listen.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.974
I can't tell you my sources, but...

39:12.725 --> 39:15.311
<i>if you go back to Zach Dempsey,
I'm sure he'll confirm the story.</i>

39:15.644 --> 39:16.854
And Alex was with Tyler?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.856
I would do anything for Alex.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.025
Or Clay. Or Jessica.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.443
Anything.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.821
And Tony Padilla,
what happens if I bring him in?

39:25.905 --> 39:26.905
You won't.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.616
He won't come after you.

39:29.241 --> 39:30.241
He can't.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.161
But I need the real story.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.455
- That he can verify.
- If this works...

39:35.623 --> 39:38.626
If. This is pretty fucked up.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.961
But the whole thing's fucked up, Tony.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.841
We don't have anything
to tie Monty to the scene.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.928
Bryce had something
he wanted to give to Jessica.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.305
Did you find anything?

39:52.223 --> 39:54.225
On the pier? On his body?

39:54.558 --> 39:55.393
No.
