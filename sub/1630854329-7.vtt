02:12.882 --> 02:14.050
Let's go, Babbo!

21:20.195 --> 21:21.989
-He's better?
-He's fine.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.908
His fever is gone,
and the infection is improving.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.702
Thank goodness.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.248
Last night, I dreamed of the Madonna.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.751
She told me the Lord had called Lino.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.670
-She was--
-Filomena.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.549
I know you're scared, but please,
I can't hear that right now.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.719
-Okay?
-I pray for him constantly.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.929
It isn't in our hands.

21:46.471 --> 21:51.727
Listen, the doctor is going in
to see Lino now. We'll talk soon, okay?

21:51.810 --> 21:55.188
Good. Kiss Idalia for me. Hmm?

25:07.631 --> 25:09.090
They fit?

37:03.095 --> 37:04.430
Where's Lino?

37:05.973 --> 37:07.808
There's nothing more they can do.

37:10.519 --> 37:11.520
We're going home.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.692
I'm going to church to pray.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.279
It's in the hands of the saints now.

41:07.423 --> 41:11.135
"To be loved deeply
by someone makes you strong."

41:53.135 --> 41:57.056
-How are you, Lino?
-How am I? I'm like this.
