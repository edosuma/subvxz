00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:06.297 --> 00:08.259
Doing laundry in
a family of nine

00:08.259 --> 00:10.721
is like a scene
out of a horror movie.

00:10.721 --> 00:13.054
There's no escape,

00:13.054 --> 00:15.186
and it always
ends badly.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.402
Incoming!

00:25.146 --> 00:27.148
GEORGIE: I'm good.

00:29.610 --> 00:32.323
But like all horror movies,
 there's one girl smart enough

00:32.323 --> 00:34.455
to outwit the monster.
 Me.

00:34.455 --> 00:36.827
Let me stop you
right there.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.371
New construction must be
approved by

00:40.371 --> 00:42.333
the boss of this town.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.665
It's me.
She's my number two.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.507
I'm about to turn
the worst chore on Planet Diaz

00:46.507 --> 00:48.299
into the coolest.

00:51.672 --> 00:53.554
Allow me to introduce

00:53.554 --> 00:55.556
Zip-A-Dee Laundry.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.558
"We get the doo-dah out."

01:03.234 --> 01:06.397
Cool! Round trip
for two, please.

01:06.397 --> 01:07.948
Slow your roll.

01:07.948 --> 01:10.571
I promised Mom...
laundry only.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.404
No human cargo
or their demented dolls.

01:13.404 --> 01:15.406
Doll? Right to her face?

01:15.406 --> 01:16.577
What's up with that?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.329
Sorry, Deathnee.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.910
Just trying to save you
a trip to the doll hospital.

01:19.910 --> 01:22.413
Although, you look like
you need one.

01:22.413 --> 01:23.794
And I need more laundry.

01:23.794 --> 01:25.916
- Can I help?
- Yes.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.588
Just stand there
and don't bug me.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.590
She left us alone.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.802
This is really
more on her.

01:33.174 --> 01:35.216
DAPHNE: Whee!

01:37.518 --> 01:39.560
Are you okay?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.602
Except for the smell.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.773
( sniffs )

01:42.773 --> 01:45.186
Daphne, what happened?

01:45.186 --> 01:46.397
( fake crying )

01:46.397 --> 01:50.191
Harley's invention
hurt me, Mommy.

01:50.191 --> 01:53.234
- Harley!
- I'm sorry, but
it's not my fault.

01:53.234 --> 01:54.825
I was trying to make
something super useful

01:54.825 --> 01:56.327
for the whole family
and Daphne--

01:56.327 --> 01:57.948
You know you're not
allowed to build anything

01:57.948 --> 01:59.700
- that could hurt anyone.
- But Daphne didn't listen.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.373
That zip line hurt me.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.295
It didn't, but I might.

02:04.295 --> 02:05.746
I told her not to touch it.

02:05.746 --> 02:08.419
That's enough. Rachel!
Georgie! Ethan!

02:08.419 --> 02:10.961
I'm so mad I don't even
know what your name is.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.803
It's Harley.

02:12.803 --> 02:14.385
Harley, upstairs.
You're on lockdown.

02:14.385 --> 02:15.966
Lockdown?

02:17.428 --> 02:20.761
Lockdown. It's the worst
 punishment in the family.

02:20.761 --> 02:24.265
Normally reserved for
 Diaz-on-Diaz crime.

02:24.265 --> 02:26.817
Pinching, biting,
 purple nurples.

02:26.817 --> 02:29.270
Really any color nurple.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.362
No visitors, no internet,
 no hope.

02:35.616 --> 02:37.658
And the first thing you're
doing when you get out

02:37.658 --> 02:40.621
is taking down
that laundry death machine.

02:40.621 --> 02:44.495
Mommy, I think
a chocolate chip cookie
would make me feel better.

02:44.495 --> 02:46.957
Oh, of course, sweetheart.

03:48.349 --> 03:50.691
Well, Daphne's hit
the sinister sixes.

03:50.691 --> 03:52.523
That's three times worse

03:52.523 --> 03:55.656
with twice the vocabulary
to blame things on me.

03:55.656 --> 03:59.069
Who got into my jewelry?

03:59.069 --> 04:01.161
DAPHNE: Harley did it!

04:02.863 --> 04:05.205
( yells )

04:05.205 --> 04:07.207
DAPHNE: Harley did it!

04:07.207 --> 04:09.580
It's easy for the youngest kid
to avoid being punished

04:09.580 --> 04:12.002
just because
they're the baby.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.715
Even if they're way too old
to act like one.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.513
Speak of the devil.
Literally.

04:27.728 --> 04:30.691
Georgie's old high tops?
Rachel's makeup mirror?

04:30.691 --> 04:33.654
So random.
What's she doing?

04:36.737 --> 04:38.449
Remember life
before we had kids?

04:38.449 --> 04:40.361
We look fun.

04:40.361 --> 04:42.453
You're reaching a little
far back for me.

04:42.453 --> 04:44.114
I can't even remember
where I put my car keys.

04:44.114 --> 04:46.787
As much as I love
a good key search,

04:46.787 --> 04:49.039
with the twins at camp,
I'm finally getting through

04:49.039 --> 04:51.211
my list of things
I haven't had time to do.

04:51.211 --> 04:52.543
Number ten, nap.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.505
That's only if
I get through the first nine.

04:54.505 --> 04:56.587
I'm happy to take
number ten off your hands.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.179
Dad, can I borrow 20 bucks?

04:59.179 --> 05:00.801
Okay, thanks.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.763
- What if I say no?
- Okay, thanks.

05:02.763 --> 05:05.516
You always borrow money
and you never pay me back.

05:05.516 --> 05:07.097
That is so not true.

05:07.097 --> 05:08.809
There was that one time
that I borrowed money

05:08.809 --> 05:10.190
to buy you a tie
for your birthday.

05:10.190 --> 05:11.642
You want 20 bucks?
Earn it.

05:11.642 --> 05:13.814
Since your sister's
on lockdown,

05:13.814 --> 05:14.895
you can run
the slushy stand.

05:14.895 --> 05:17.027
Kids, sticky stuff,

05:17.027 --> 05:18.699
the general public.

05:18.699 --> 05:20.651
Does any of that sound like
something I'm about?

05:20.651 --> 05:22.653
How come she gets
to work there?

05:22.653 --> 05:25.245
I've been brainstorming
slushy names for months.

05:25.245 --> 05:28.038
Co-co-be Bryant.
Lindsay Vonn-illa.

05:28.038 --> 05:31.622
Peyton Banan-ing. I'm still
working on that one.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.043
You can work on it while
you're slinging slushies

05:33.043 --> 05:34.835
with Rachel.
You're both hired.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.457
As long as I get
my 20 bucks.

05:36.457 --> 05:37.798
You mean you're
paying us too?

05:42.963 --> 05:46.597
Georgie, you won't believe.
Daphne--

05:46.597 --> 05:48.519
Sorry. Can't talk to you.
Lockdown rules.

05:48.519 --> 05:51.061
Oh, no, I just did.
Please don't tell Mom.

05:51.061 --> 05:54.234
- I just did it again.
- Forget lockdown.

05:54.234 --> 05:56.527
Daphne just dumped a bunch
of stuff in the backyard.

05:56.527 --> 05:58.439
All I heard was "just"
and "a,"

05:58.439 --> 06:00.481
and that can still get me
two days in the hole.

06:00.481 --> 06:02.282
♪ La la la la la la la ♪

06:02.282 --> 06:03.574
Georgie, wait.

06:03.574 --> 06:05.486
Come back.
I need your help.

06:05.486 --> 06:07.488
And that's Rachel's
backpack.

06:08.579 --> 06:10.120
Ethan.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.703
Ethan!
Ethan, down here.

06:18.088 --> 06:20.050
I'm not supposed
to be talking to you,

06:20.050 --> 06:22.132
even through 20 feet
of aquarium tubing.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.134
You've got to see this.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.717
Daphne's in the yard,
and she's up to something.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.810
Forget it.
I'm not breaking lockdown rules.

06:29.810 --> 06:33.103
Fine, but she's got that tuner
you use when you sing.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.897
My Voice Bot?

06:36.897 --> 06:39.279
But that's what
makes me sound like...

06:39.279 --> 06:42.022
a rap star ballin'
outta control

06:42.022 --> 06:43.944
with a hot model girlfriend
on a yacht.

06:43.944 --> 06:47.027
See, this is why
I need the voice changer.

06:47.027 --> 06:48.789
That's not all
she's got.

06:48.789 --> 06:50.030
Dad's high school
football trophy,

06:50.030 --> 06:51.912
that candle Mom says
she's gonna burn

06:51.912 --> 06:53.794
when she finally
gets to take a bath.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.746
All right. I'll just
tell Mom what's up,

06:55.746 --> 06:58.338
Daphne gets caught,
I can sound like a playa again.

06:58.338 --> 07:00.881
And telling on Daphne
won't be good enough.

07:00.881 --> 07:02.543
She can weasel her way
out of anything

07:02.543 --> 07:04.134
and put the blame on me.

07:04.134 --> 07:05.806
Glad she never blames me.

07:05.806 --> 07:08.719
I've got a 14-year
lockdown-free streak going.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.101
Which reminds me.
I'm not supposed
to be in here.

07:11.101 --> 07:12.723
You think that's gonna last?

07:12.723 --> 07:14.725
Lewie and Beast
are at camp,

07:14.725 --> 07:17.317
I'm holed up in here.

07:17.317 --> 07:19.820
Who do you think is next
in Daphne's path of wrath?

07:23.323 --> 07:24.945
( yells )

07:24.945 --> 07:26.737
DAPHNE: Ethan did it!

07:26.737 --> 07:29.990
Oh, yeah,
she's goin' down.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.451
Great. Now
help me sneak out.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.203
Are you nuts?

07:33.203 --> 07:35.375
If Mom comes in the room,
she'll know you're not here.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.957
I'll be an accomplice.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.959
I'm not built for lockdown.
I'm a people person.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.791
I got it covered.
Check it.

07:43.043 --> 07:44.795
Mom Tracker 2.0.

07:44.795 --> 07:47.758
It's smaller, quieter,
and even tracks her heart rate.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.591
I made it from a pedometer
Mom bought

07:50.591 --> 07:52.853
when she was on
her big power-walk phase.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.975
She power-walked five steps
to the cookie drawer
where she left it.

07:58.438 --> 08:00.731
Okay, clogs,
we got a big day.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.232
We're starting.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.654
They called us
up to the show.

08:03.654 --> 08:05.816
Hammies, I'm talkin'
to you, too.

08:05.816 --> 08:08.488
Get ready for
the slush rush.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.914
You know, you should
really start memorizing
the slushy menu.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.826
What if someone orders
off a secret menu?

08:15.826 --> 08:18.208
The secret is,
if you want a slushy,

08:18.208 --> 08:20.881
order off
the regular menu.

08:20.881 --> 08:23.584
Girls, I gotta go
pick up some parts
for an outboard motor.

08:23.584 --> 08:25.125
I'll be gone all afternoon.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.797
BOTH: So we get to go home?

08:26.797 --> 08:28.929
Actually, I need you two
to watch the store.

08:28.929 --> 08:30.801
Rachel, since you're the oldest,
you're in charge.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.053
Fine. My cell works better
over by the cash register
anyway.

08:33.053 --> 08:35.976
That's my girl.

08:35.976 --> 08:37.938
Now that you're in charge,

08:37.938 --> 08:39.940
you should really
start brushing up on
the slushy flavors,

08:39.940 --> 08:42.312
- and the bait prices.
- Why?

08:42.312 --> 08:44.645
I went from slushy stand
to store manager

08:44.645 --> 08:46.196
by sitting here and texting.

08:46.196 --> 08:48.609
I'm obviously
doing something right.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.074

09:04.464 --> 09:06.166
Hey, Mom, I know you're busy--

09:06.166 --> 09:07.798
Not doing number ten.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.129
Still checking things off
my to-do list.

09:09.129 --> 09:12.472
You wanna know one of
my favorite to-dos?

09:12.472 --> 09:14.264
Givin' my mom a hug.

09:14.264 --> 09:16.266
Awww, bring it in.

09:18.979 --> 09:21.481
Paying more attention
to my kids is
number four on my list.

09:23.734 --> 09:29.279
Harley! I've been searching
for this photo for hours.

09:29.279 --> 09:31.992
Look at your sister
on her training potty.

09:31.992 --> 09:34.114
That's something no brother
needs to see.

09:38.158 --> 09:41.702
Freedom never smells as good
as when you're on lockdown.

09:41.702 --> 09:43.794
( sniffing )

09:43.794 --> 09:48.128
Actually, freedom smells like
tuna fish and rotten bananas.

09:48.128 --> 09:51.171
Trash day,
you're killin' my moment.

09:53.053 --> 09:55.265
Great. Now
she's on the run.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.769
HARLEY: Clementines.

09:58.769 --> 10:01.271
Daphne's favorite snack.

10:01.271 --> 10:03.353
Follow the peels,
we'll find the perp.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.727
Yeah, a brother and sister
following a trail of food.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.438
That always ends well
in fairy tales.

10:19.239 --> 10:20.661
Caught her.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.913
Wait, what did we
catch her doing?

10:22.913 --> 10:25.455
HARLEY: Having the world's
weirdest tea party?

10:25.455 --> 10:27.708
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

10:29.379 --> 10:31.051
Step right up.

10:31.051 --> 10:33.633
Daphne and Deathnee's
Little Shop of Wonders

10:33.633 --> 10:36.516
has got what you need.
Everything priced
to sell, people.

10:36.516 --> 10:39.720
Whoa! She's not just
stealing stuff from the house.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.972
She's selling it.

10:41.972 --> 10:44.224
Daphne is so busted.

10:46.476 --> 10:49.569
She's about to do
 some hard time in lockdown.

10:52.863 --> 10:56.536
Today's special: baby teeth.
Three for a dollar.

10:56.536 --> 11:00.120
This is bad, Ethan.
She's stealing stuff
from the tooth fairy now.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.954
We got her.
I'm gonna film it.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.956
Uh...

11:05.956 --> 11:09.169
Harls, what exactly
do we have on her?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.501
It just looks like
she's playing shop.

11:11.501 --> 11:14.174
Plus, she's so adorable
in that visor,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.636
Mom will totally
believe her.

11:18.388 --> 11:19.970
Aww, she really is
the cutest Diaz.

11:21.972 --> 11:25.565
Cute like a baby wolverine.
But you're right.

11:25.565 --> 11:28.809
We have to wait to catch her
while money's changing hands.

11:28.809 --> 11:31.021
Lucky for us, Mom's
busy with her project.

11:32.152 --> 11:34.074
( phone rings )

11:37.988 --> 11:41.201
( ringing continues )

11:41.201 --> 11:43.493
Lewie and Beast's
camp again.

11:43.493 --> 11:45.786
What did they do this time?

11:45.786 --> 11:48.749
They threw Ron
off the roof?

11:48.749 --> 11:51.001
Oh, Ron's a CPR dummy?

11:51.001 --> 11:53.133
That's not so bad.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.135
What if I go buy back
my Voice Bot

11:55.135 --> 11:56.837
and you catch it all
on camera?

11:56.837 --> 11:58.969
Daphne's not gonna sell
to you, her brother.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.220
She's not dumb.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.973
No. Not me.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.435
I'm going undercover
as hip-hop bad boy

12:05.435 --> 12:08.478
and warrior poet
E-Town McMoney.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.021
He's cooler than the rest,
he's a BFTF.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.614
That's best fun
in the family.

12:14.614 --> 12:16.446
I can't believe
this is my best option.

12:21.912 --> 12:24.034
Rachel, your friends
are playing with

12:24.034 --> 12:25.996
a deluxe adult flotation vest

12:25.996 --> 12:27.287
for a non-Coast Guard
approved use.

12:28.668 --> 12:31.001
Stop, Kiki.
Take that off.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.084
Orange is so not your color.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.087
Try this.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.640
Adorbs.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.642
Do you have any idea
how mad Dad will be

12:42.642 --> 12:45.645
if he comes back and sees
there's a party going on?

12:45.645 --> 12:47.767
We can't blow this.
He called us up to the bigs.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.599
Don't think of it as a party.

12:49.599 --> 12:51.771
Think of it as a bunch
of people buying slushies here,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.984
and not at the boba shop
across the street,

12:53.984 --> 12:55.355
which totally means
we're winning.

12:55.355 --> 12:57.487
There's a way to win
at slushy?

12:57.487 --> 12:59.279
Totes. And we're
crushing it.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.705
Is this a joke?
I can't let this retainer
go for two bucks.

13:05.705 --> 13:08.038
It was used by
the Marshport werewolf.

13:14.004 --> 13:15.505
What up, mama?

13:15.505 --> 13:18.218
How about three bucks for
the voice changer, yo?

13:18.218 --> 13:19.299
Deal.

13:21.882 --> 13:25.135
I'm sure it'll help with
that lame disguise, Ethan.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.187
How'd you know it was me?

13:27.187 --> 13:28.728
I don't think
acting's your thing.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.430
Stick to guitar.

13:30.430 --> 13:33.143
Actually, you're not so hot
at guitar either.

13:33.143 --> 13:34.564
Laugh it up,

13:34.564 --> 13:36.276
because you're
in big trouble.

13:36.276 --> 13:39.529
Oh, really? It seems like
it's your word against mine,

13:39.529 --> 13:41.111
and mine comes with this.

13:43.783 --> 13:45.115
Awww!

13:45.115 --> 13:47.207
Well, mine comes with this.

13:47.207 --> 13:48.869
( kids yelling )

13:48.869 --> 13:51.791
Hey, that's my Voice Bot.

13:51.791 --> 13:54.294
You're not old enough
to be a playa.

13:54.294 --> 13:55.956
Gotcha, little thug.

13:55.956 --> 13:58.258
You're going on
lockdown for a year.

14:04.554 --> 14:07.767
When I say Co-co be,
you say Bryant. Co-co be.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.639
- ALL: Bryant.
- Co-co be.
- Bryant.

14:09.639 --> 14:11.181
In your face, boba place.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.355
- Brain freeze!
- ( all cheering )

14:20.360 --> 14:22.072
What is going on here?!

14:25.155 --> 14:26.987
Put my daughter down.

14:28.828 --> 14:33.163
You, take off that deluxe
adult flotation vest.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.496
Everybody out!
This party is over!

14:36.496 --> 14:38.628
You two are on lockdown.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.171
Lockdown? I didn't bite
or nurple anyone.

14:42.342 --> 14:46.556
She's in charge.
Brain freeze.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.812
Go ahead.
Show Mom the video.

14:52.812 --> 14:54.935
She's going to wonder
how you got it

14:54.935 --> 14:56.566
while you were in
your room on lockdown.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.278
I don't care if I go down

14:58.278 --> 15:00.690
as long as you're
going down with me.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.232
I'm not afraid of Mom.

15:02.232 --> 15:03.573
( tracker beeping )

15:03.573 --> 15:05.235
Uh-oh. Mom's on the move.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.327
Just so you know,
when people say uh-oh,

15:07.327 --> 15:08.828
it usually means
they're afraid.

15:09.869 --> 15:11.911
Harley, I'm bringing you
a snack.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.494
- ( buzzing )
- HARLEY: Mom Tracker 2.0.

15:14.494 --> 15:16.666
Weird. There's
nothing in here.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.419
Now comes with
 Mom distraction devices.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.251
Now what was I doing?

15:21.251 --> 15:22.422
Including dryer ding.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.806
Come on. Selling
our family stuff?

15:26.806 --> 15:28.598
That's a new low
even for you.

15:28.598 --> 15:30.850
I need money
to buy new toys.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.642
You've got toys here.

15:32.642 --> 15:34.975
Board games,
badminton rackets.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.397
I mean stuff I can
play with by myself.

15:37.397 --> 15:41.061
Deathnee's cool, but I have
to come up with all the ideas.

15:41.061 --> 15:42.822
Hold up.

15:42.822 --> 15:46.276
You're selling
the Harley hoop?

15:46.276 --> 15:47.447
But I made this for you.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.120
Well, it's not like
we play with it anymore.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.831
We had a whole fun routine.

15:51.831 --> 15:53.873
The Dazzling Diazes,
remember?

15:53.873 --> 15:55.875
I'd start.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.289
Then you'd go
under the bridge.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.503
Then you'd come back.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.509
And then I would
pass it to you.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.183
Then I'd start.

16:13.183 --> 16:14.974
And pass it to you.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.516
But there's no you
anymore.

16:16.516 --> 16:19.059
And I can get
three dollars for this.

16:19.059 --> 16:21.441
Ten if I say
it belongs to Lady Gaga.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.696
Harley, wanna go melt stuff
in my Tiny Bake oven?

16:26.696 --> 16:28.908
Can't. Going to
the movies with Georgie.

16:28.908 --> 16:31.371
HARLEY: Oh. I get it now.

16:31.371 --> 16:34.324
Wanna go hide-and-go-bury?

16:34.324 --> 16:36.576
Can't. Ethan and I
are going to the mall.

16:36.576 --> 16:38.328
( door closing )

16:38.328 --> 16:40.420
When I hit the double digits,

16:40.420 --> 16:43.383
I guess I left
 the single digits behind.

16:43.383 --> 16:46.626
The problem isn't that
 Daphne wanted me in trouble.

16:46.626 --> 16:49.219
She just wanted me.

16:52.632 --> 16:55.395
I'll give you ten dollars
for the hula hoop.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.057
But it wasn't
Lady Gaga's.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.560
No. It belonged to
someone way cooler.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.355
So I chased the kid
who took my Voice Bot

17:05.355 --> 17:07.237
all the way to
the marina.

17:07.237 --> 17:10.150
Bad news. Dad just
put Rachel and Georgie
on lockdown,

17:10.150 --> 17:11.611
and they're heading home.

17:11.611 --> 17:13.782
Also, we missed
a pretty awesome party.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.156
Great. As soon as
they get there,

17:16.156 --> 17:18.748
they're going to see
I'm not in my room.
I'm busted.

17:18.748 --> 17:21.921
No, you're not.
We can get you back safe
if we work together.

17:21.921 --> 17:24.164
Wait, we're working
 with her now?

17:24.164 --> 17:27.166
Boy, you leave for a minute,
the whole world turns
on its head.

17:27.166 --> 17:30.380
I'm so glad I updated
Mom Checker two point...

17:30.380 --> 17:32.632
( gasps )
Mom Tracker's offline.

17:34.724 --> 17:36.136
Where'd you guys come from?

17:36.136 --> 17:38.178
Uh... nowhere special.

17:38.178 --> 17:40.350
Not doing anything unusual.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.982
Way to keep it
cool, dimples.

17:42.982 --> 17:44.814
What happened to
Mom Tracker?

17:44.814 --> 17:47.066
She took off
her sweatshirt.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.399
Okay, feeling better
about my invention.

17:49.399 --> 17:51.571
- ( door opens )
- But, Dad!

17:51.571 --> 17:53.363
Girls, I don't
wanna hear it.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.695
And way worse about
ever getting upstairs.

17:55.695 --> 17:57.907
But it wasn't
even a party.

17:57.907 --> 17:59.829
It was savvy marketing
for your fish killing store.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.001
And we destroyed
the boba shop.

18:02.001 --> 18:04.254
Their mascot was crying
little tapioca tears.

18:04.254 --> 18:08.087
You know, if Zip-A-Dee Laundry
can get me downstairs,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.420
it can get you upstairs.

18:13.052 --> 18:16.055
What? Are you kidding me?
Not a party?

18:16.055 --> 18:19.849
- Daphne, you're a genius.
- You just noticed?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.642
There were more kids at my store
than I have in this house.

18:22.642 --> 18:25.275
It's good to know when
Lewie and Beast are gone,

18:25.275 --> 18:27.437
the rest of the kids
will step up to make
our lives difficult.

18:31.651 --> 18:34.444
But, Dad, we made you $180.

18:34.444 --> 18:37.447
Oh, actually, 160.
You still owe me that 20.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.502
Um... me and my socks.

18:42.502 --> 18:43.703
Hangin' out.

18:46.206 --> 18:48.878
Okay. Girls,
you're on lockdown.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.710
Upstairs.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.632
Sorry, Dad.

18:54.093 --> 18:55.965
I'm not sorry.
That was a great party.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.557
When I say boba,
you say tears. Boba.

18:57.557 --> 18:59.559
- Tears.
- Boba.
- Tears.

19:05.265 --> 19:07.477
Hey, guys.
Is it dinnertime yet?

19:07.477 --> 19:10.320
Sure lose track of time
when you're on lockdown.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.903
Well, don't worry.
You're getting some
new cellmates.

19:15.615 --> 19:17.577
Harley, were you outside?

19:17.577 --> 19:20.280
Are these your footprints?

19:20.280 --> 19:22.412
Harley didn't do it.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.205
Ethan did.

19:26.786 --> 19:30.460
It wasn't Ethan.
It was me.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.342
I broke lockdown rules.

19:32.342 --> 19:34.924
But it was totally worth it.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.136
Okay, I don't know
what's going on here,

19:37.136 --> 19:39.138
but you're both
on lockdown.

19:39.138 --> 19:42.562
Made it 14 years
lockdown-free.

19:42.562 --> 19:44.063
That's still
a family record.

19:48.398 --> 19:49.939
This is inhumane.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.071
I can just feel
I'm getting a text right now.

19:52.071 --> 19:54.073
They don't even let us
walk the yard.

19:54.073 --> 19:57.407
- ( clattering sound )
- DAPHNE: I did it!

19:57.407 --> 19:59.989
Those are words I never
thought I'd hear Daphne say.

20:02.662 --> 20:04.664
I got myself on lockdown.

20:04.664 --> 20:07.287
And look what I got.

20:07.287 --> 20:09.709
- Ready to kick it?
- You know it.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.131
The Dazzling Diazes
are back.

20:15.174 --> 20:17.677
Check out my 360.

20:17.677 --> 20:19.969
All right.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.643
Check out
my double crisscross.

20:23.643 --> 20:26.436
One, two, three.

20:28.688 --> 20:31.731
I'm so entertainment-starved,
this actually looks fun.

20:33.943 --> 20:36.616
That's the funny thing
 about being a little kid.

20:36.616 --> 20:38.738
No matter how big you get,

20:38.738 --> 20:41.030
you have to remember
 the littles.

20:41.030 --> 20:43.953
( laughing )

20:45.535 --> 20:48.498
And that's
the Dazzling Diazes.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.878
Hey. Thought you were
gonna clean out the garage.

20:58.878 --> 21:00.470
I'm done with projects.

21:00.470 --> 21:02.682
With all the kids
on lockdown,

21:02.682 --> 21:05.595
I'm gonna do what I really
wanna do... nap.

21:05.595 --> 21:07.387
Treat yourself, hon.

21:09.649 --> 21:12.982
( cell phone rings )

21:14.944 --> 21:17.106
It's Beast and Lewie's camp.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.740
Spare me the details.

21:20.740 --> 21:23.533
We'll come get them now.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.746
Paid for a week,
they made it a day.

21:26.746 --> 21:28.498
Still better than last year.
