00:02.160 --> 00:03.286
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.480 --> 00:06.165
We're bad for each other
and we're never gonna get where we need to.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.288
We'll just end up back here,
where we started.

00:08.480 --> 00:12.280
Travelers have the ability
to keep living inside someone else's body.

00:12.440 --> 00:16.764
You're a hunter. That officially makes you the
only person in this room that I can trust.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.491
You're gonna protect Elena,
I'm gonna stop the Travelers.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.290
I'm going to need some help.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.761
The Travelers are up to something big.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.766
- Now they're on the move.
- Mystic Falls.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.801
You lose something?

01:11.040 --> 01:13.008
Uh, yes, it's a...

01:13.160 --> 01:15.640
particularly mortifying page
from my journal.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.162
Oh. You, uh, censor your journal?

01:19.400 --> 01:22.244
Pretty sure that's, uh,
against journal rules.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.282
And I'm pretty sure that
you're not the journal police.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.886
Trust me, it's really bad.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.649
I'm officially intrigued.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.728
And I'm officially not kidding.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.964
Thank you.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.562
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.323
You Okay?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.769
Yeah, I just...

02:07.520 --> 02:10.045
I just had a really crazy dream.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.370
So you broke up. That I get.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.087
Then you slept together.
Not smart, but again, I get it.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.686
Now, here's where it
gets a bit hazy for me.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.882
You went to a parent-teacher conference?

02:32.040 --> 02:34.122
Jeremy was having some trouble at school.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.290
you offer to drive her back to campus...

02:37.480 --> 02:41.280
and she says she can't be around you.
I'm just confused even thinking about it.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.289
- Can't imagine how you feel.
- I'm fine.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.245
- We're taking time apart.
- Of course. The friends phase.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.041
Where you, her friend,
watch as she moves on with her life.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.683
Finds a new boyfriend,
perhaps a nice gentleman from a fraternity.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.770
Chance or Brock.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.727
Does your mysteriously missing girlfriend
know how insufferable you are?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.928
- Heh.
- Maybe that's why you haven't found her?

03:04.160 --> 03:05.764
She doesn't want to be found.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.049
I haven't found her because the Travelers,
I.E. my only lead...

03:09.240 --> 03:11.766
decided to play a game
of spontaneous combustion...

03:11.960 --> 03:13.769
before giving me what they promised.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.884
Great. Now you're here, annoying me.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.451
We can always go kill people.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.849
But I suppose that's what got you
into this problem in the first place.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.406
I guess my mom's not here yet.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.688
- I'm going to get us some coffees.
- Sure.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.807
Oh.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.963
- Here you go.
- I'm gonna need these. Heh.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.966
- So clumsy.
- So, uh, you hated the movie, huh?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.362
No. Heh. I didn't hate it.

03:51.560 --> 03:56.202
I just wasn't exactly
paying attention, either.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.008
- So do you wanna pick up dinner...?
- We should, uh, do this again sometime.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.605
Yeah.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.805
- Sure.
- Good.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.365
Sorry, that's my dad...

04:23.600 --> 04:25.762
waiting up for me.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.368
That's so embarrassing.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.009
I'm really looking forward to dinner.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.570
Me too.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.646
- Good night.
- Night.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.885
<i>My mom's five minutes away... Elena?</i>

04:52.040 --> 04:53.610
Hello? Elena?

04:59.240 --> 05:00.685
How did I get here?

05:00.880 --> 05:02.564
I was just standing at the doorway.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.404
Uh, you walked?

05:07.720 --> 05:10.849
Hang on. Did you just have
one of those dreams? Like, right here?

05:11.080 --> 05:14.721
It didn't feel like a dream. It felt
like it was real. Like I was just there.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.923
Weird.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.403
Caroline, if you bite your
tongue any harder, you'll bleed.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.604
Say it.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.931
It's Psych 101.
Actually, it's whatever comes before 101.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.841
You told Damon you couldn't see him
and now you're dreaming about Stefan?

05:36.320 --> 05:40.882
It's not just about Stefan, okay?
My parents were still alive.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.368
It was like a different life.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.321
- Stefan, hey.
- Hey.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.410
- Is everything okay?
- You know how sometimes you feel crazy...

05:53.560 --> 05:56.166
and you call me and I tell you
that you're not crazy?

05:56.360 --> 06:00.081
- Even though most of the time I am.
- Well, I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.964
Uh, no promises. Heh.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.243
I was walking to my car
and nearly got plowed over in the street.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.010
I had a vision of Elena.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.285
I take that back.
Actually, you're not crazy at all.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.289
Something's going on.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.171
<i>Hey, it's Jeremy. Leave</i> a <i>message.</i>

06:18.360 --> 06:20.169
Hey, Jeremy, it's me.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.563
Bonnie Bennett, your girlfriend.
Just in case you need reminding.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.970
Which I'm happy to keep doing
until you call me back.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.481
So call me.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.324
Hey, Grams.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.686
I heard the Travelers
did a number on you last night.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.331
Did you read that in
the Other Side newsletter?

06:56.720 --> 07:00.088
- Grams, you don't look right.
- Something's wrong over here, Bonnie.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.244
Some of the witches think
the Travelers tried to overwhelm you...

07:03.440 --> 07:04.930
so someone could get through.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.323
- As in come back?
- Whoever it is, he's hiding from us.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.170
And now this place is...

07:15.200 --> 07:17.362
That wasn't creepy.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.331
- What's going on over here?
- I don't know.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.525
But whatever the Travelers did
and whoever managed to get through...

07:26.040 --> 07:27.530
it's got the witches scared.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.768
The Travelers are here
and our goal is to get rid of them.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.808
But before I put my faith
in the Three Stooges...

07:40.960 --> 07:43.486
I need to be sure you aren't
harboring a Passenger.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.690
You want us to stab ourselves?

07:45.880 --> 07:48.360
This knife is the only thing
that'll get rid of them.

07:48.560 --> 07:53.009
- Again, you want us to stab ourselves.
- Just do it so we can get on with this.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.527
Says the hunter with the
Traveler-proof head.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.291
<i>- I'll</i> do it.
- And the hybrid who heals.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.042
Dude, you have a magic ring that brings you
back from the dead. Quit bitching.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.126
Shoulder. Shouldn't hurt too much.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.685
Not too deep.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.169
I can help if you...

08:33.640 --> 08:36.041
So much testosterone. So few brain cells.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.807
Okay. We're all in the clear. Wanna
tell us exactly what we're doing here?

08:40.000 --> 08:44.289
Easy. You just have to do that about
a hundred more times. Only to other people.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.762
Look, the truth is...

08:48.000 --> 08:52.289
that my coven have been tracking
the Travelers for thousands of years.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.962
They're always on the move.
But there've been a few times in history...

08:56.160 --> 08:58.049
<i>when they've stopped to gather.</i>

08:59.960 --> 09:02.691
The freaky part is that
no one's ever noticed.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.683
<i>Because one by one,
they've taken over towns...</i>

09:06.840 --> 09:10.049
<i>by putting Passengers
inside of the townsfolk.</i>

09:10.200 --> 09:12.009
They're doing the same in Mystic Falls.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.808
Care to lose again or shall we move on
to step two of Elenaless Damon?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.163
Bringing up her name defeats the purpose
of me trying to forget her.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.049
Bring up who's name?

09:51.200 --> 09:52.247
Elena.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.444
Whatever.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.011
Speak of the devil.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.691
- Hey, have you heard from my mom?
- No, why?

10:05.840 --> 10:08.730
She was supposed to meet me here
and now she's not texting me.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.121
If you see her, tell her something came up?

10:11.320 --> 10:12.890
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, thanks.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.411
Damon, one. Temptation, zero.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.449
Temptation, one. Enzo...

10:26.680 --> 10:27.841
Hello, gorgeous.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.607
Can you tell Damon that there's something
going on with Elena and Stefan?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.125
What?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.806
Well, you know how we all
laughed off the notion...

10:39.000 --> 10:41.731
that the universe was drawing
Stefan and Elena together? Heh.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.446
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Well, that's happening.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.326
- What's happening?
- Now that Stefan's doppel-him...

10:48.720 --> 10:50.722
- Tom?
- Tom, <i>yes.</i>

10:50.920 --> 10:54.641
Now that Tom is dead, Stefan and Elena
are the last pair of doppelgangers.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.680
Which might explain why
Stefan and Elena are suddenly having...

10:58.920 --> 11:02.925
vision-type situations of each other.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.964
Wait, what kind of visions?

11:06.160 --> 11:09.289
You know what she's not telling you.
Somebody's having sex dreams.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.888
- They're not sex dreams.
- Yeah, they're more like romance dreams.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.243
I don't need to know that. Where's Stefan?

11:16.440 --> 11:19.489
The Traveler camp, to see if anyone
can tell him what's going on.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.967
- Yeah, good luck with that.
<i>- It's</i> our only <i>lead.</i>

11:22.200 --> 11:24.407
Look, all we know is that Tom is dead...

11:24.600 --> 11:27.649
the Travelers committed a mass suicide,
and Stefan and Elena...

11:27.800 --> 11:31.043
who are not together anymore,
are having visions of each other.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.164
Find a witch, get her here,
let's figure out what's going on.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.850
- Bonnie.
- Surprise.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.441
Not really. I left you a
voice mail and texted.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.802
Yeah, I know, I know. Sorry, I, um...

11:48.000 --> 11:49.889
I've just been busy moving and stuff.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.651
Right, all your stuff.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.684
Anyway, I need help.
Something's going on, on the Other Side.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.120
What do you mean?

11:58.560 --> 12:02.042
My Gram says the witches
are worried someone got out.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.530
- And I thought since you could see ghosts...
- Jeremy, come on. Back to work.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.166
Liv's here? Are you kidding me?

12:10.360 --> 12:11.885
It's not what it looks like.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.521
Jeremy hired me to help him with math.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.645
Right, was that before or after you lied
to my face and tried to kill his sister?

12:18.880 --> 12:20.120
Tell me what's going on.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.924
I can't. I'm sorry.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.729
We have this handled, I just...

12:25.920 --> 12:27.729
I need you to trust me, okay?

12:37.560 --> 12:39.927
Look, I told you I didn't want
to keep any secrets.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.485
Nothing personal, Jer.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.366
But sneaking up on the Travelers requires
them not to know that we're doing it.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.326
I already broke my rule once
for Matt and Tyler.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.524
- I'm not doing it again.
- Where are you now?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.690
Checking on the sheriff,
but she's not here.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.491
I know it's probably nothing,
but if I were going to take over a town...

12:59.680 --> 13:03.241
You'd start at the top. Don't do
anything stupid before I get there.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.887
I can't do anything until you bring
the Traveler knife, so hurry up.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.844
Traveler knife?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.124
Sheriff, hey.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.005
Who you talking to?

13:14.560 --> 13:16.164
Uh, Caroline.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.124
She said you missed lunch
so I told her I'd check up on you.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.803
You mentioned a Traveler knife.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.526
Did I? Maybe you misheard.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.163
I didn't.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.767
Matt?

13:50.840 --> 13:53.650
- What are you doing here?
- I'm dead, Bon.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.605
But the sheriff's in trouble.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.606
- What?
- Just tell Jeremy. He'll know what I mean.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.442
I'm sorry to do this to you, Bon.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.367
Can you see me?

14:29.760 --> 14:30.807
Are you a witch?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.449
Then how?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.844
It's all topsy-turvy over here, darling.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.003
But I gotta say, it's good to be seen.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.848
Don't tell me you don't remember me?

14:49.080 --> 14:51.367
Kol? Original Vampire?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.807
Murdered pointlessly by Jeremy Gilbert.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.803
Yeah, I know who you are.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.328
I thought the point of this
was to live out your afterlife in solitude.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.450
Why can I see you?

15:01.640 --> 15:04.086
Well, apparently, there's
trouble in paradise.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.762
The rumblings from the witches is that
somebody tore his way out of here...

15:07.920 --> 15:09.604
and now this place is unraveling.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.768
Not that that matters to you.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.447
You're just on holiday.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.287
Which means, you're going back.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.126
- Vicki...
- Never heard of her.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.643
She's my sister.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.447
She's over here. If I can see you
then that means I can see her.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.165
- Thought you were bringing a witch.
- I said we'd call her.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.691
Didn't say we'd pick her up.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.651
So where's, uh...?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.285
Where's Damon?

15:49.520 --> 15:52.444
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.567
- So who could use a drink from the library?
- Yes, please.

16:02.120 --> 16:06.842
Well, at least they're not being obvious.
Heh.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.641
You got a pool table.

16:11.800 --> 16:16.488
Yeah. I figured pool was a good outlet to
put this pent-up energy I seem to now have.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.489
Yeah, I went running today.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.286
<i>- Ten miles, could've gone 20.
- Yeah.</i>

16:21.440 --> 16:23.568
Ugh, this is so bad.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.404
They're fishing for small talk.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.087
- We should do something.
- Or we could stay...

16:30.320 --> 16:34.370
and let them amuse us as they resist the
desire to tear each other's clothes off.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.604
- Drink?
- Probably not a good idea.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.406
- Inhibitions and all.
- Well, wouldn't want that.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.170
Can we not do this?

16:45.360 --> 16:48.728
We're not doing anything.
But I think that's part of the problem.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.161
We're just standing...

16:52.920 --> 16:56.367
clothed. Just standing, doing nothing.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.531
I mean, the whole strained...

17:00.720 --> 17:03.087
awkward, don't-know-how-to-act part.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.851
Oh.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.127
Can't we just be friends and...

17:07.319 --> 17:09.084
do friendly things...?

17:09.280 --> 17:12.443
Ouch, she used the F-word. Poor bastard.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.251
But I thought that's what this was?

17:15.440 --> 17:18.284
Oh, it is.
It was never explicitly stated until now.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.646
And that matters because...?

17:20.839 --> 17:24.640
Because until it's officially out there,
there's still hope.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.041
And hope? Well, heh, heh.

17:27.359 --> 17:32.241
Hope can trick you into all sorts
of hilariously unrealistic scenarios.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.807
You mean Maggie?

17:36.720 --> 17:38.404
So, what happened?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.889
Well, the Travelers forgot to tell me
where Maggie was...

17:43.080 --> 17:45.481
before they lit themselves on fire.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.609
Talk about a lead going up in smoke.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.801
Yeah, but, and no offense...

17:51.000 --> 17:54.163
But even if she still was alive,
wouldn't she be, like, really old?

17:55.920 --> 18:00.369
Seventy years of captivity
and she was the face that I clung onto.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.322
Just the notion that one day
I'd get out and see her again...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.002
I don't want to date her, Caroline.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.128
I want to thank her.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.766
So...

18:16.520 --> 18:19.524
- Having sex dreams about my brother?
- Wow. Okay, yeah, that's...

18:19.680 --> 18:21.762
definitely one way
to change the subject.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.129
- I was trying to skip the uncomfortable part.
- Yeah.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.762
Look, I don't know what...

18:28.680 --> 18:31.524
the visions mean, Damon. It's just...

18:31.760 --> 18:37.005
random snippets of Stefan and me
living in some alternate reality.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.606
I'm gonna regret this, but...

18:42.120 --> 18:47.524
by any chance are, uh, fantasy Elena
and fantasy Stefan really...

18:47.720 --> 18:49.802
really, really happy?

18:51.280 --> 18:52.964
Um...

18:53.960 --> 18:55.041
Right.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.801
Well, as your friend...

18:59.560 --> 19:01.050
let me state the obvious...

19:01.320 --> 19:04.802
that the prophecy says
that you two are fated to be together.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.488
You're supposed to be together.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.081
We're all good on Bibles, thanks.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.770
I'm Luke Parker, Liv's twin brother.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.724
Liv has a twin?

19:32.920 --> 19:35.605
Is it possible for there to be
one of someone around here?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.680
- Where's Liv?
- Busy.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.445
Come on in.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.124
Hey, sheriff.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.244
Hey, Tyler.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.001
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.640
You know me.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.091
I certainly do.
And hybrids are not above the law.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.525
So do me a favor, keep the day drinking
at the Grill on the DL, please?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.650
It's bad for business.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.406
Right. Will do.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.646
Anyway, I'm running late.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.730
My mom says hi.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.491
Send her my best, okay?

20:38.640 --> 20:41.246
You're okay. You're safe now.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.928
What do you mean
you can't stop their visions?

20:47.120 --> 20:50.124
Magic doesn't work like that.
We're not bigger than the universe.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.641
- Then why are you in my house?
- We need your help.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.922
We think the Travelers
are making their move.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.567
- Their leader, Markos, is here.
- From where? Chant camp?

20:58.760 --> 21:01.604
The Other Side. He's been dead
for centuries and we think...

21:01.800 --> 21:04.929
- ...the fire sacrifice allowed him to escape.
- Perfect.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.282
A dead old guy with a mysterious evil plan.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.690
I'll take that drink now.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.367
Stefan just called. He said the scrap
yard's been completely cleared out.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.126
So let me guess.
The witches don't know where Markos is.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.563
You said the visions are trying
to draw Elena and Stefan together.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.962
For our doppelganger blood.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.891
The Travelers need it for some prophecy.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.527
If the Travelers are the ones who need
your blood, doesn't it make sense...

21:28.720 --> 21:31.007
that you're being drawn together,
but also...

21:31.160 --> 21:33.367
Being drawn to them.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.281
Well, this just keeps
getting better and better.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.567
Wait, I don't get it.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.404
If the visions are a road map...

21:39.600 --> 21:41.364
then we need more clues.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.124
Break out the popcorn, blondie.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.684
Elena's little sex romp isn't over yet.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.563
What are you doing out here?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.402
Ah, you know, looking at the stars...

22:10.640 --> 22:12.927
listening to the universe laugh at me.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.330
Damon.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.521
We were doomed from the beginning, Elena.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.603
We were always gonna end up here.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.930
Damon...

22:27.720 --> 22:29.563
they're just visions.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.567
As soon as we find Markos, they'll stop.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.685
And then what?

22:35.080 --> 22:37.287
We're friends? Can't wait.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.807
Look, I know we're in a little bit of
a weird place right now...

22:52.360 --> 22:53.441
<i>Hey-</i>

22:53.640 --> 22:56.371
- Hmm.
- Look at me.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.802
The universe doesn't control anything.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.485
It's not real.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.085
Hey.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.524
- You're really trying to pull off this chef thing.
- Yeah, well...

23:28.680 --> 23:30.762
it's our, uh, anniversary...

23:30.920 --> 23:32.843
so no holding back.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.846
Well, if it turns out anything like
your last <i>22</i> attempts, wine.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.445
Mm. Perfect.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.288
I always forget.
Where do we put the opener?

23:43.840 --> 23:46.764
Oh, no, no, no. Not that drawer.
Not that one.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.166
Yes.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.087
You didn't even open it.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.082
I don't have to.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.724
I love you.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.088
I love you too.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.690
Elena. Hey.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.848
- Did I just...?
- Yep.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.442
That good, eh?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.889
He's here.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.327
I know where Markos is.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.928
4620 Walnut Drive.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.723
Vicki?

25:18.040 --> 25:19.849
Vicki?

25:23.240 --> 25:24.446
Vick?

25:29.160 --> 25:30.730
No.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.922
How am I back here?

25:34.840 --> 25:36.524
Matt?

25:44.280 --> 25:45.520
Vick?

25:45.720 --> 25:47.210
Matty.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.084
I'm here.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.051
I'm here now. It's okay.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.204
No, listen to me. It's not okay.
Something's wrong.

26:00.360 --> 26:04.160
Look at this place. Matty, you need
to get to your body and go back.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.163
I'm not leaving you. We're getting out.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.606
- Take my hand.
- Matt, no.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.404
- Take my hand!
- Matt.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.845
- Matt.
- Vick.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.686
- Vick.
- Matt.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.285
Vicki, I won't let you go.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.845
Matt...

26:36.480 --> 26:37.766
I love you.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.451
But I'm already dead.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.808
- Vicki. Vicki!
- No!

26:46.400 --> 26:48.164
Vicki!

26:54.160 --> 26:55.730
Vick.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.006
Ah. Clear.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.410
I wonder if this is where Stefan
and Elena had crazy vision sex.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.844
It was probably the bedroom.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.651
Stefan's pretty vanilla.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.449
But apparently that's
Elena's favorite flavor.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.802
I'm gonna staple you tongue to your chin.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.526
Not in my house. Please.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.011
Markos, I take it.

27:57.600 --> 28:00.365
Well, I'm not Stefan,
and this is not Elena.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.965
Why are you here?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.646
I was about to ask you the same question.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.001
Plus, what do you want...

28:06.200 --> 28:09.363
and why are the doppelgangers
having visions of each other?

28:09.520 --> 28:11.807
First two are complicated.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.565
Last one's easy.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.769
I'm the reason Stefan and Elena
are having visions of each other.

28:17.680 --> 28:18.806
You?

28:18.960 --> 28:21.566
Well, would you look at that.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.609
I think we just met the universe.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.801
You mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

28:31.960 --> 28:35.931
I'm afraid the doppelganger lore's
been misinterpreted over the ages.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.445
As in, there is no prophecy?

28:39.600 --> 28:43.161
The prophecy is that the doppelganger
blood can help the Travelers.

28:43.520 --> 28:47.366
They're being drawn together
because of a spell I cast 1500 years ago.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.449
I had no idea where they were.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.850
And it turns out...

28:52.080 --> 28:55.448
the best way to get people
to go searching for each other...

28:55.680 --> 28:57.648
is the promise of true love.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.804
Is it stuffy in here?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.445
Why don't we take a walk?

29:08.200 --> 29:10.646
- You stay here.
- Not bloody likely.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.326
You want to find Maggie?

29:15.480 --> 29:17.164
You stay here.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.960
Shall we?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.048
Mystic Falls is a beautiful town.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.046
Oh, yeah. Picket fences. Block parties.
Uncannily high death rate.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.725
You take your home for granted.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.884
I'm sorry, are we walking
so I don't fall asleep?

29:35.120 --> 29:38.522
Two thousand years ago, Silas and Qetsiyah
cast the spell for immortality.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.842
Created a schism
in the Traveler community...

29:41.000 --> 29:43.048
giving rise to the witches.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.807
They tried to keep us scattered
to make us forget how powerful we can be.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.731
Thus began the war between
the Travelers and the witches...

29:49.880 --> 29:51.120
and it still rages on.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.484
Sorry. I just nodded off.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.401
The witches put a curse on us
that kept us from settling down as a tribe.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.722
Whenever we've tried to gather,
disaster struck.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.360
Plagues. Earthquakes. Fire.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.090
Something inevitably wiped us out.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.561
Let me guess.
The doppelgangers can fix this.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.690
So you found them.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.887
Now what?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.849
We simply need their blood.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.404
But we're not your enemy, Damon.
And to prove that to you...

30:18.600 --> 30:20.967
I'm gonna stop their visions.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.963
The curse might prevent us
from gathering in our own bodies.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.730
But we've found ways around that.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.446
Passengers.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.204
So...

30:42.560 --> 30:43.891
how many of you are there?

30:44.680 --> 30:45.761
A few.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.570
Here and there.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.849
Shall I continue?

31:01.120 --> 31:04.681
<i>... which brings misty
winds and cool, low temperatures expected.</i>

31:07.600 --> 31:09.204
<i>Hey-</i>

31:09.440 --> 31:11.090
Sol, um...

31:11.600 --> 31:14.444
I got your Aunt Jenna
a wine-of-the-month thing.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.880
Think she'll like that?

31:16.280 --> 31:20.205
The only thing I think she would've liked
more would've been a wine-of-the-day thing.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.647
Thank you.

31:21.800 --> 31:26.249
Oh. I talked to Jeremy,
and he's bringing a girl home this year.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.044
Ooh. So is Damon.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.250
Mm. I'm sure they'll both be lovely.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.641
Liar.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.400
- Hey, guys, share.
- Hey.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.130
Please.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.481
- You know that she bit him this morning?
- Really? Nice.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.089
Stefan, don't encourage that.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.805
What? Everybody loves a biter.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.883
Oh, yeah? I'll bite you.

31:51.080 --> 31:54.084
Good. I'll bite you right back.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.367
It's done.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.125
Elena.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.204
Did you feel that too?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.529
And then it just ended.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.886
Does that mean that it's over?

33:00.880 --> 33:02.370
Yeah.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.084
It's over.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.169
They weren't real.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.049
It was a spell.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.606
Showing us what we wanted to see.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.923
We weren't vampires.
My parents were still alive.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.647
It was a fantasy.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.524
Like a movie.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.201
It was a life we never could've had.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.847
- But it still felt...
- Amazing.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.607
Yeah.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.330
But, you know, the life that we had...

33:49.040 --> 33:50.769
I mean, that was amazing too.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.083
And it wasn't...

33:54.240 --> 33:56.049
a spell or prophecy.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.123
It was real.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.443
We fell in love on our own.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.645
You know, we had ups and downs.
We fought.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.803
I died.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.371
Yeah.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.600
We changed. Both of us.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.245
We grew.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.966
We grew apart, but that is real.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.208
I mean, that's life.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.360
You couldn't cook.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.811
And you could.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.922
Again, a fantasy.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.882
I'll always love you, Elena.

34:53.639 --> 34:56.643
I will always love you too.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.561
Do you think Damon and I
will ever be able to talk like this?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.843
Like friends?

35:15.320 --> 35:18.688
I think you can either
be friends with someone or...

35:18.880 --> 35:20.370
in love with them.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.526
I don't think you can be both.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.010
All right, then.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.680
Mourning time over. Chip chop.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.370
Not to be insensitive,
but she was already dead.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.211
Little bit of a grief
overkill, don't you think?

35:43.360 --> 35:45.044
Where did she go?

35:45.960 --> 35:50.045
I mean, did she move on?
Did she find peace?

35:51.080 --> 35:53.970
Because it certainly didn't look like that.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.004
I don't know where she went.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.931
And honestly, I would
love to never find out.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.128
Which is why I need you
back in your body...

36:01.280 --> 36:04.648
shouting from the rooftops
about what happened here.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.210
Doesn't matter. When I go back,
I'm not gonna remember this.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.129
You better find a way to remember it.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.647
Look, you might not like me...

36:17.400 --> 36:19.641
but I'm not the only one over here.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.845
And if this place goes down...

36:22.000 --> 36:25.243
then, what happened to your sister
is going to happen to us all.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.090
Please, mate.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.529
You have to go back.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.848
You have to find a way how to stop this.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.361
What?

36:42.520 --> 36:46.809
I just realized you're the only person
in this office the sheriff hasn't killed.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.963
You're making jokes now?

36:49.560 --> 36:52.040
Bonnie, look, I'm sorry. For everything.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.211
This whole thing with Liv,
it had nothing to do with her.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.362
I was just trying to protect you.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.205
Okay, here's what's not okay.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.609
Do what you want to protect me.
Don't fall off the face of the earth.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.003
Especially with someone who was lying to me
and tried to kill Elena.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.931
Don't put me in a position
where I have to question you.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.128
- Because...
- I know. Because of Anna.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.203
- Look, I know I messed up...
- Listen.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.330
I was gonna say
because I choose to trust you.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.728
And I want to be right.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.366
Matt. Are you okay? Are you okay?

37:27.520 --> 37:30.967
- You died and came back from the Other Side.
- I know.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.527
- I remember.
- You remember?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.001
That doesn't happen.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.126
One second...

37:37.320 --> 37:38.731
I was holding Vick...

37:38.920 --> 37:40.888
- Wait, you saw Vicki?
- Yeah.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.650
She pushed me away.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.885
And then...

37:45.400 --> 37:47.562
And then she just disappeared.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.444
What's going on over there, Bon?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.609
I don't know.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.126
I think we need some rules, here.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.328
Because if I'm not allowed
to drive you home, then I...

38:15.880 --> 38:19.521
definitely don't think you're allowed
to ambush me in my bedroom.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.724
I just...

38:23.920 --> 38:26.890
I just wanted to say thank you.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.164
Whatever you did, it worked.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.731
Ah.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.324
Well, I'm sorry to tear you away
from paradise.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.484
It was paradise, actually.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.569
I told you, I don't want to know.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.006
But you need to know.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.530
I saw...

38:47.440 --> 38:48.805
a perfect life.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.041
Stefan and I were married.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.440
We had kids.

38:53.640 --> 38:56.166
It was everything that we wanted.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.721
Well, we can always ask Markos
to put it back.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.848
But it's not real.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.244
You and I...

39:04.040 --> 39:06.281
we're messy and...

39:06.440 --> 39:08.681
complicated, but...

39:10.360 --> 39:12.010
we're real.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.891
And really bad for each other.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.844
Did you forget that part?

39:21.120 --> 39:23.521
Yeah, but I still need you in my life.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.806
As friends, right?

39:27.360 --> 39:28.441
Right.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.006
No, Elena, I can't be your friend.
It's too damn hard.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.089
- Damon...
- No, I'm serious, Elena.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.480
I can't see you anymore.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.891
I don't wanna hear your voice.
I don't wanna talk to you.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.610
I don't even wanna look at you.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.286
And I sure as hell
don't wanna be your friend.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.968
If that's what you want...

39:55.640 --> 39:57.085
That's what I want.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.005
Okay.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.125
Yeah. Okay.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.205
<i>I</i> gave her my blood-

40:18.400 --> 40:21.290
- What do I do? She's still unconscious.
- For starters...

40:21.520 --> 40:24.120
relax. Matt said he was out for a while
when this happened to him.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.605
What are they doing here?

40:27.760 --> 40:30.286
This is our home.
We can't let them take over.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.086
They won't. I got it handled. I promise.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.481
Thanks, Tyler.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.926
<i>You're welcome.</i>

40:36.560 --> 40:38.562
I gotta go. She's waking up.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.801
<i>Hey-</i>

40:41.760 --> 40:43.205
What happened?

40:45.480 --> 40:47.881
You missed lunch. Heh.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.325
We're in.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.608
She's oblivious.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.731
It's not a bad upgrade either.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.207
- This body is incredible.
- Don't get used to it.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.567
Once this is over, and the town is ours...

41:03.720 --> 41:06.041
I know. It's gone.

41:06.680 --> 41:07.761
Did you bring it?

41:10.160 --> 41:12.003
This is the only knife left.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.241
Was the only knife left.
