00:04.003 --> 00:07.590
{\an5}(Alex)
In Siesta Key, every day
is like living the dream,

00:07.674 --> 00:11.886
{\an8}and this summer,
I was the luckiest guy in town.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.306
{\an8}I was catching major vibes
from the new girl, Kelsey.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.268
{\an8}The only problem
was her boyfriend Garrett.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.770
{\an7}I'm hoping we stay together
for a long time.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.149
{\an8}(Alex)
We went to high school with him
and he's a nice enough guy,

00:24.232 --> 00:26.609
but he was never
really part of our crew.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.445
{\an5}Obviously, he knows
that I'm dating you.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.445
{\an1}Yeah.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.779
There's that boundary.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.281
(Alex)
But that was Kelsey's problem.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.242
My problem was Juliette.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.161
She was totally irresistible,

00:36.244 --> 00:38.455
but she wanted me all
to herself.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.123
{\an1}I don't want a repeat
of last summer.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.958
It didn't really end well.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.960
{\an5}(Alex)
But things were easier
with Madisson

00:44.043 --> 00:46.838
ever since we decided
just to be good friends.

00:46.921 --> 00:50.133
Everything was cool until
Pauly opened up his big mouth

00:50.216 --> 00:52.135
about me and Amanda
hooking up.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.094
They slept together?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.138
(Alex)
But in my defense, it happened

00:55.221 --> 00:58.641
{\an5}before Amanda broke
Chloe's nose.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.641
{\an3}Oops.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.143
They were fighting
over Brandon,

01:00.226 --> 01:01.728
but the real problem was

01:01.811 --> 01:03.438
that Amanda had been lying
to Chloe.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.149
How many of your friends
haven't been with Alex?

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
{\an3}Me.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
{\an1}Me.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.195
My actions were about
to catch up to me

01:10.278 --> 01:11.196
at the worst possible time.

01:11.279 --> 01:17.285
{\an8}♪ All I see is money,
all I see is fame ♪

01:17.368 --> 01:18.828
{\an8}♪ Diamonds sparkle, sparkle ♪

01:18.912 --> 01:21.164
{\an8}♪ People want my bling ♪

01:21.247 --> 01:23.333
{\an7}Hey.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.333
{\an9}What up?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.001
{\an8}I need to tell you something

01:25.084 --> 01:27.962
{\an7}and, like, I don't really know
how to handle it, but...

01:28.046 --> 01:31.633
{\an7}I'm hearing something,
and I just wanna know, like...

01:32.842 --> 01:35.178
Did you sleep with Amanda?

01:38.515 --> 01:42.060
{\an3}Oh, God.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.607
Well, um, I mean,
I wasn't gonna tell you,

01:47.690 --> 01:49.025
but like, all that (bleep)
went down.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.486
{\an1}I can't believe you
want to be my best friend

01:51.569 --> 01:52.695
and (bleep) her too?

01:52.779 --> 01:55.949
{\an1}I mean, it sometimes
feels like, damn, okay,

01:56.032 --> 01:57.742
{\an1}kinda thought we were better
friends than that.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.786
{\an5}No, I mean,
it was like nothing,
you know what I mean?

01:59.869 --> 02:01.287
{\an1}No, that is another one
of my friends,

02:01.371 --> 02:04.874
{\an1}but you know, maybe casually
mentioning it, just like,

02:04.958 --> 02:08.044
{\an4}"Hey, I respect you
enough to, like,
let you know."

02:08.127 --> 02:09.878
{\an1}I mean, I planned on
telling you, I just, like--

02:09.963 --> 02:11.589
honestly, it's old news
at this point.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.258
It's not gonna
happen again, like...

02:13.341 --> 02:16.469
I don't plan on it
happening again, at least.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.682
{\an1}When did you and Amanda,
like, hook up?

02:20.765 --> 02:23.434
{\an1}Was it, like, before my nose
or after my nose?

02:23.518 --> 02:25.436
Yeah, it was before
your nose.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.397
{\an1}I'm not stupid enough--
I would have never done that

02:27.480 --> 02:29.399
{\an5}after the fact,
you know what I mean?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.399
{\an1}Yeah.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.651
{\an5}Well, that means a lot.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.651
{\an1}Like, that would be the last
thing I would have done.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.946
Amanda's told me, like,
"I would never do that,

02:35.029 --> 02:37.782
{\an1}like, I'm better than that,"
blah, blah, blah.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.450
{\an1}And then to kinda hear it,
it's like,

02:39.534 --> 02:41.828
{\an1}I've definitely lost
a little respect for her.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.372
{\an1}I thought Amanda
was different.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.459
Don't you think you should
man up and deal with this

02:48.543 --> 02:50.295
before Juliette finds out?

02:50.378 --> 02:51.963
She doesn't have to know.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.257
I'm just trying
to enjoy the summer and...

02:54.340 --> 02:55.592
I mean, like...

02:55.675 --> 02:57.510
{\an1}If Paul's going around
saying it,

02:57.594 --> 03:00.221
{\an1}I just think, you know,
for the sake of her feelings,

03:00.305 --> 03:03.641
{\an1}I think Juliette should hear it
from you and no one else.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.188
{\an1}Your problem,
you figure it out.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.940

{\an7}(Madisson)
I've been organizing
this gala fundraiser thing

04:04.994 --> 04:06.788
{\an8}with Alex and his mom.

04:06.871 --> 04:07.997
{\an7}It's a fundraiser
for autism.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.292
{\an7}Alex has two
autistic siblings.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.669
{\an9}Really?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.669
{\an8}Yeah, do you know that?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.879
{\an9}Uh-uh.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.879
{\an7}Yeah, he, like,
loves them to death.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.464
{\an8}How'd I not know this?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.257
{\an7}There's more to him
than you think.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.551
{\an9}Must be.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.551
{\an7}Yeah.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.886
{\an8}So, he was the one
that thought of this?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.263
{\an7}Yes.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.263
{\an8}Wow, I'm surprised.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.182
{\an7}I know.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.182
{\an8}I'd love to see
that side of him,

04:26.265 --> 04:27.141
{\an7}'cause I don't feel like
I've seen that at all so far.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.686
{\an7}Yeah, you have to come
to the gala.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.937
{\an8}I would love to.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.647
{\an8}I'm really happy
to hear that Alex

04:32.730 --> 04:35.692
{\an8}has a more soft side
and more to him.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.527
I feel like all I ever hear
about when it comes to Alex

04:37.610 --> 04:40.029
is girl drama
and more girl drama.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.490
Yeah, yeah.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.283
Especially with
everything going on.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.786
{\an1}What?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.786
Like, Chloe told me

04:46.869 --> 04:48.287
that Amanda and him
hooked up.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.789
{\an5}Oh, my God.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.789
Like, while Juliette and him

04:49.872 --> 04:52.875
have kind of just been,
like, hitting it off.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.671
{\an1}I'm honestly--
I mean, that sucks.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.548
{\an3}Yeah.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.548
But I'm not surprised.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.717
{\an3}Really?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.717
Yeah, yeah.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.094
{\an1}That's-- it's a shame,
but I feel totally--

05:03.177 --> 05:04.429
{\an3}Over him?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.429
{\an1}Yeah.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.098
Good, so are you, like,
gonna move on from him?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.725
Oh, absolutely, I...

05:08.808 --> 05:10.560
Is there anyone that you're
talking to right now or no?

05:10.643 --> 05:12.061
{\an1}Nope.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.061
{\an3}No?

05:12.145 --> 05:12.812
{\an1}No.

05:12.145 --> 05:12.812
Single girl.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.189
{\an1}Yeah.
(laughs)

05:15.273 --> 05:16.232
{\an1}Trust me, it probably avoids
a lot of complication.

05:16.315 --> 05:20.194
{\an4}Aw.

05:16.315 --> 05:20.194
Take my word for it, but...

05:20.278 --> 05:22.030
{\an1}How are you
and Garrett doing?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.531
{\an3}Eh... okay.

05:23.614 --> 05:27.452
{\an1}Like, right now, Garrett and I
are pretty rocky, um...

05:27.535 --> 05:28.745
{\an1}What?

05:27.535 --> 05:28.745
{\an3}Yeah.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.122
We hadn't talked much
about the future,

05:31.205 --> 05:32.623
were kinda just,
like, putting it off,

05:32.707 --> 05:34.083
and then finally,
the other day,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.461
we had a talk
about it, and...

05:36.544 --> 05:39.005
I think we're just kind of
in different parts

05:39.088 --> 05:40.840
of our life right now.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.840
{\an1}Mm.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.800
{\an1}Just feeling that out
right now, it's pretty tough,

05:42.884 --> 05:44.969
but I think...

05:42.884 --> 05:44.969
{\an1}Yeah.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.387
...day by day
at this point.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.139
{\an1}Yeah, and I thought
you guys seemed

05:48.222 --> 05:49.932
{\an1}like such, like,
a fairy tale couple.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.768
I'm so sorry to hear that,

05:51.851 --> 05:54.145
{\an1}but I really hope you both
will still come to the gala.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.646
Well, I really want to go,
and I'll make sure I do,

05:55.730 --> 05:59.025
{\an4}and then I'm gonna try
my best to convince Garrett.

05:55.730 --> 05:59.025
{\an1}Yeah.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.194
I think he's just kind of
more shy around this group

06:01.277 --> 06:03.780
because it's not really
his type of people.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.782
{\an1}I get where he's
coming from, like,

06:05.865 --> 06:08.743
{\an1}Siesta Key
is super classist.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.453
{\an5}Well, I'll talk to him.
I think--

06:08.826 --> 06:10.453
{\an1}Yeah.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.205
{\an1}I feel like he should give
this group more of a chance...

06:12.288 --> 06:13.956
{\an4}Yeah.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.956
...and kind of see
the other side,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.000
{\an1}'cause even with Alex, like,
I've not seen that...

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
{\an4}Yeah, yeah, I think
you both should.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
...side of him.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.004
{\an5}You both should.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.004
Yeah, I think it'd be
good for both of us.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.463
{\an3}Stuck?

10:27.209 --> 10:30.463
{\an1}Yeah.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.132
{\an4}Me and Garrett
talked last night.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.132
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.051
{\an1}You know how he kinda, like,
usually beats around the bush?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.303
{\an6}Yeah.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.303
Well, he didn't last night.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.555
{\an1}He started asking questions
about the future,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.433
{\an1}like, relating
to our relationship.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.644
{\an1}He was just like, "Well,
where do you see us going?"

10:44.727 --> 10:48.397
What do you see
in the future with you?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.899
I don't know where I'm at.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.611
{\an5}(Garrett)
I'm just really
trying to figure out,

10:53.694 --> 10:56.238
{\an5}like, what she exactly
wants to do, and...

10:53.694 --> 10:56.238
And what's that?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.075
{\an8}She doesn't know and that
scared me in a way,

10:59.158 --> 11:01.869
{\an1}you know, 'cause everything
was, like, so great

11:01.952 --> 11:03.412
and, like, we were
having a great time.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.414
And then all the sudden,
boom, she was like,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.000
"I don't know, like,
future-wise with us."

11:08.084 --> 11:08.793
But it's, like, why, though?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.753
{\an1}Where is she coming from
with that?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.922
I don't know.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.090
{\an4}(Kelsey)
That's where
it's challenging for me.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.466
{\an1}He knows what
he wants exactly.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.634
{\an1}He knows he wants
to be a personal trainer,

11:16.717 --> 11:19.512
{\an1}he knows that he wants
to be with me,

11:19.595 --> 11:20.846
he knows he loves Florida.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.473
{\an1}I've just been living
in the moment,

11:22.556 --> 11:23.849
I haven't even been
thinking about it.

11:23.933 --> 11:24.725
{\an1}And I just want
to enjoy my summer

11:24.809 --> 11:27.395
{\an1}and hang out with Alex
and those guys.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.064
So that scares me
that I'm so unsure

11:30.147 --> 11:31.649
and he's sure and...

11:31.732 --> 11:34.276
{\an1}It sounds like you're maybe
on two different pages.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.279
{\an4}(Garrett)
I was the only one that
she really hung out with,

11:37.363 --> 11:39.490
{\an1}now she's kind of having
a little bit more fun.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.784
{\an1}I feel like maybe this group
is kind of, like...

11:41.867 --> 11:43.994
{\an5}But if anything, though.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.994
{\an1}...bringing her apart
from being with me.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.287
Don't let her
bring you down.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.580
Like, Alex, Paul, like,
we know them

11:46.664 --> 11:47.957
{\an1}from high school, man, like,
they live at a different pace.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.210
{\an1}She's going there with all this
cool stuff that she can do,

11:51.293 --> 11:52.461
{\an5}like boats and all
that kinda stuff.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.461
{\an1}Yeah.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.464
{\an1}Where it's like us, you know,
we're in trenches grinding.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.465
{\an1}Obviously, like,
I don't have, like, a boat

11:56.549 --> 11:57.675
{\an1}or anything, you know,
like, but you know, like--

11:57.758 --> 12:00.010
That's not even
what matters, man.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.554
{\an1}No, I know that's, like,
not what matters.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.388
She just is so into, like...

12:02.471 --> 12:05.307
Caught up in that.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.307
{\an1}Yeah.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.809
As a mom, I hate
to see you like this,

12:06.892 --> 12:10.980
and the only thoughts
I have is that...

12:11.063 --> 12:13.732
just with being sick,
with the M.S.,

12:13.816 --> 12:16.610
{\an1}that life is so short
and I would just encourage you

12:16.694 --> 12:21.115
to do what makes
your heart happy

12:21.198 --> 12:23.451
deep down inside.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.162
You know, he's
a great guy and--

12:26.245 --> 12:28.873
{\an1}That's what makes it worse,
like, if he could just, like,

12:28.956 --> 12:31.041
do something bad,
that'd be great.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.668
It'd make things
so much easier.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.004
Well, I don't want
you guys in limbo

12:35.087 --> 12:40.217
and I feel like you're gonna
have to come to a decision.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
{\an1}I need to.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
{\an3}Right.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.556
Sooner than later.

I think that's badass.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.574
{\an5}And the feathers?

13:02.531 --> 13:03.574
{\an1}Yeah.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.826
{\an5}That's perfect.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.826

{\an9}Yes.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.582
{\an8}No, this is sweet.
How many people we have coming?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.125
{\an8}Like 147, around there.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.376
{\an8}Oh, wow.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.376
{\an7}I know.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.878
{\an1}There's a lot of these kids
that are affected

13:15.961 --> 13:17.505
with autism now, so...

13:17.588 --> 13:18.881
Well, and so are you,
'cause it's personal.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.549
{\an5}I think so too.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.549
Like, it's true.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.718
Obviously, it was hard
on all of us,

13:22.801 --> 13:24.762
raising two children
with autism,

13:24.845 --> 13:27.264
{\an1}especially being the oldest.
We're fine, but you know,

13:27.348 --> 13:30.518
other families
aren't as fortunate.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.478
Like, this is--
you know, it's huge.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.730
{\an1}Let me go check
and see out in the wood room

13:34.813 --> 13:36.565
if they're finished.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.067
It's gonna be badass.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.069
This place is amazing.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.947
{\an5}So, this is all hers?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.947
{\an1}All of it.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.198
What have you been doing?

13:44.281 --> 13:46.867
{\an3}Um...

13:46.951 --> 13:49.286
{\an5}Well, I heard something...

13:46.951 --> 13:49.286
{\an3}Huh?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.913
...that I wanted
to ask you about.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.540
{\an6}Huh?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.540
Did you hook up with Amanda?

13:52.623 --> 13:55.376
It's not even a big deal,

13:55.459 --> 13:57.044
I don't know why
everyone's freaking out.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.837
{\an1}I mean, but it was
a big deal.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.756
Did you talk to Juliette?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.216
{\an3}I did.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.216
{\an1}Yeah?

14:02.299 --> 14:04.385
She just, like,
kinda, like,

14:04.468 --> 14:06.762
{\an1}called me a piece of (bleep)
for no reason, like--

14:06.845 --> 14:08.264
Well, she's obviously hurting.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.934
{\an5}She really doesn't have
the right to be that
upset with me.

14:12.017 --> 14:12.935
Like, we weren't official.
Like, if we're not dating,

14:13.018 --> 14:15.437
we're both free
to do what we want.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.107
And you've established
that you're not dating?

14:18.190 --> 14:23.362
Alex, your actions
have consequences.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.323
{\an1}I just want to see you
grow and be...

14:26.407 --> 14:30.077
{\an1}I mean, I think that you would
have so much love to give.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.454
{\an4}Like, I really
think you could.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.454
{\an3}I do.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.706
{\an4}I'm saving it
for the right person.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.706
You're spreading it around.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.542
{\an5}Maybe you should...

14:33.789 --> 14:36.542
I'm saving it for
the right person.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.753
{\an1}All right, Alex,
I hope so.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.590
I am, I promise.
I wouldn't lie to you.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.511
(Juliette)
I mean, I should have--

14:47.595 --> 14:50.431
{\an8}It's Alex, like,
what did I think?

14:47.595 --> 14:50.431
{\an7}(Chloe)
Yeah.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.933
{\an8}I knew that was coming and
that's kind of why I'm mad.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.685
{\an8}I mean, he lives in this,
like, little bubble

14:54.768 --> 14:56.353
{\an8}where he can do
whatever he wants

14:56.437 --> 14:59.231
{\an1}and that it's not gonna affect
the people around him.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.067
{\an1}I'm mind-blown
that Amanda did this.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.736
It goes without saying,

15:03.819 --> 15:05.988
you're not supposed
to hook up with friends.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.073
{\an4}Gross.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.073
I mean, she knew I was
hooking up with him

15:08.157 --> 15:08.991
and, like, she thinks
that it's okay

15:09.074 --> 15:11.577
to do that type
of stuff, it's not.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.494
{\an1}Hello?
Girl code.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.496
I don't know what
she was thinking.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.791
{\an1}Another Alex Kompo groupie ho
trying to get attention.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.710
It's just rude.
Like, I don't know.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.380
{\an1}And I'm mad at her because
she didn't mention it to me.

15:23.464 --> 15:27.509
{\an1}Not too long ago, Amanda
and I went and got pedicures

15:27.593 --> 15:30.346
{\an1}and Amanda was just
going on and on how, like,

15:30.429 --> 15:33.265
{\an1}she would never do
something like that.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.017
And everything she's preached,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.478
{\an1}it's the exact opposite,
and I'm like...

15:37.561 --> 15:40.230
Are you mad about just her
not telling you or...

15:40.314 --> 15:42.650
{\an1}Well, first, she lied
about Alex,

15:42.733 --> 15:45.361
then she broke my nose.
I just don't trust her.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.237
Yeah.
He's such a dick.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.864
{\an1}So can you do me the tiniest
little bit of respect

15:48.947 --> 15:51.367
and just not hook up
with her at all

15:51.450 --> 15:54.495
{\an1}if him and I are hooking up?
It's just...

15:54.578 --> 15:57.539
{\an1}I just know that that's
never going to happen again.

15:57.623 --> 16:01.502
{\an1}Um... I'm not putting myself
back in that situation.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.544
But you know
what I will do?

16:02.628 --> 16:05.381
I'm going to the gala
in the hottest dress,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.549
and Alex is gonna realize
that he messed up,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.385
{\an5}so he doesn't think
that he's hurting me
and that he's--

16:09.468 --> 16:12.721
{\an4}You really think
you'll never hook up
with Alex again?

16:15.391 --> 16:16.433
{\an3}(sighs)

16:19.228 --> 16:21.897
{\an5}(Alex)
Juliette and I
have always had a hard time

16:21.980 --> 16:23.565
staying away from each other.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.568
And even if Juliette
didn't want to admit it,

16:26.652 --> 16:29.863
it was hardly the end
of our story this summer.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.164
{\an7}(Madisson)
So have you been
getting to spend

16:39.248 --> 16:40.791
{\an7}a lot of time
with them, Alex?

16:40.874 --> 16:42.376
Yeah, I try to, like,
do as much as I can

16:42.459 --> 16:44.002
with the kids, obviously.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.797
{\an4}I'm sure it's hard,
like, being away.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.797
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.257
{\an8}Yeah, 'cause I don't know,
like, what goes on

16:48.340 --> 16:50.342
{\an8}when I'm not here,
it freaks me out.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.844
{\an8}All right, um...

16:51.927 --> 16:52.636
{\an8}Hey, Sarah, can you
come over here

16:52.720 --> 16:55.431
{\an8}and cut some tomatoes?

16:55.514 --> 16:58.142
{\an8}You're good at it.
You're better than me.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.852
Come on.
It'll be fun.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.896
{\an8}(Madisson)
Show me how it's done.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.776
{\an9}Yeah?

17:07.859 --> 17:10.319
That's perfect, Sarah,
thank you.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.614
Yeah, she's really good
at helping out.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.075
I remember in high school,
you were always,

17:15.159 --> 17:18.287
like, hanging out
with Bronson and Sarah.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.622
I just feel bad
for, like, other kids

17:20.705 --> 17:22.124
that aren't as well of and...

17:22.207 --> 17:23.584
Yeah, no, absolutely.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.126
Their parents have to work
and they really don't

17:24.209 --> 17:26.462
have anything to do.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.796
{\an8}Thank you so much, Sarah,
that was a big help.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.257
{\an8}Do you want to
cut the lettuce.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.302
{\an8}No thank you?

17:30.340 --> 17:33.302
{\an8}You want some Coke?

17:33.385 --> 17:36.513
{\an8}All right.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.140
{\an8}I guess Bronson's next.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.976
{\an9}Yeah?

17:41.059 --> 17:44.563
{\an8}What's up?

17:44.646 --> 17:45.022
{\an8}You want this, too?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.649
{\an8}There you go.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.444
{\an8}Sara, do you want
anything else?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.279
{\an8}No, thank you?
Are you done?

17:52.362 --> 17:53.781
{\an9}Okay.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.743
This is what I love
about you, in a friend way.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.953
When you have
such a soft heart.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.288
It's really cute.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.499
Well, I appreciate that.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.333
Look at Pip.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.419
He's pissed he didn't
get a taco.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.925
{\an8}(Kelsey)
So pretty.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.511
{\an8}(Juliette)
This is my favorite thing
to do, I'm not gonna lie.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.721
{\an8}The theme of this party
is Gatsby.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.182
{\an1}Okay, well, I think
we got some good stuff here.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.519
{\an5}(Chloe)
What do you think, like,
definitely sparkles or...

18:23.602 --> 18:24.478
Gold, black, white.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.731
I'm trying to think of
'20s-themed stuff.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.691
Do you guys like this color?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.109
Yeah, but it's
not for Gatsby.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.736
Yeah, you're right.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.946
Are you going with
Garrett to the--

18:34.029 --> 18:35.239
Yeah. Yeah.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.239
{\an3}You are?

18:35.322 --> 18:36.657
What do you think,
Juliette?

18:36.740 --> 18:37.866
{\an8}Normally, you would

18:37.950 --> 18:40.744
{\an8}have probably went
with Alex, but...

18:40.828 --> 18:43.121
{\an1}Alex and I ended,
first of all.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.707
{\an5}Really?

18:43.205 --> 18:45.707
I don't even want to...

18:45.791 --> 18:47.292
Yeah.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.210
{\an1}I'm still
so mad at Amanda.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.213
Do you think she's
coming to the gala?

18:51.296 --> 18:52.673
Oh, my God.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.966
I mean, she texted me--

18:54.049 --> 18:55.634
See, what's funny about
this whole situation is,

18:55.717 --> 18:58.512
{\an1}while Alex was telling me
that he hooked up with her,

18:58.595 --> 19:01.348
{\an1}she was texting me, saying,
"What are you wearing?

19:01.431 --> 19:04.017
{\an4}What accessories
are you gonna get?
do you wanna go shopping?"

19:04.101 --> 19:06.228
{\an1}It's embarrassing and it--
Just, like, it hurts.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.896
{\an1}Like, that's just
really wrong.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.231
Yeah, I mean,
he's such a flirt.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.733
Even on the boat, he was
kinda, like, flirty.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.194
{\an5}Like, I don't know.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.194
In front of Garrett?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.572
Yeah, and so, that--

19:16.655 --> 19:17.906
I'm not surprised.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.157
Like, Garrett didn't
say anything,

19:19.241 --> 19:20.742
'cause you know
how Garrett is,

19:20.826 --> 19:22.119
he's not very, like,
straightforward all the time.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.412
How flirty was it?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.580
{\an1}Did he offer to
take you fishing?

19:24.663 --> 19:25.330
Yeah, he has, but, like--

19:25.414 --> 19:28.959

{\an1}he wants to be
a personal trainer

20:29.561 --> 20:31.730
and wants to stay here
and ideally live here

20:31.813 --> 20:32.606
and start a family.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.232
{\an1}I want to go
do my thing, meet people,

20:34.316 --> 20:36.944
{\an1}see the world
and then settle down.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.111
{\an1}We're, like, on two

20:38.195 --> 20:40.364
{\an1}And so much to
figure out, it's like...

20:40.447 --> 20:42.115
{\an1}Like, right when I moved
here, we just kinda

20:42.199 --> 20:44.451
jumped into things
'cause we clicked.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.494
{\an3}Yeah.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.494
And it worked.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.204
{\an1}But then now I'm like, okay,
well, this is the time

20:47.287 --> 20:50.040
{\an1}in life to have fun
and, like...

20:50.123 --> 20:52.000

20:52.084 --> 20:54.169

life to live before
you settle down.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.946
I-- I congratulated
him after his speech.

40:07.029 --> 40:11.325
{\an5}I don't know, it seems
like you always want
to be around him, so...

40:11.408 --> 40:13.869
{\an5}I literally just said--

40:11.408 --> 40:13.869
Well, I'm gonna go.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.204
{\an1}Like, I don't want
to talk to you.
