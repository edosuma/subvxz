00:02.560 --> 00:04.280
NARRATOR: Previously
on Dance Academy--

00:04.320 --> 00:07.200
-Third years, I want to
introduce Wes Cooper.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.480
Not only is he part of the
brat pack of apprentice

00:09.519 --> 00:12.160
choreographers in Europe, he's
traded a Spanish summer

00:12.199 --> 00:15.119
working with Impresion to create
a world premiere piece

00:15.160 --> 00:16.280
for your tour.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.719
-We're going to tear up
regional Australia.

00:17.760 --> 00:21.559
And I need you as my wing man.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.079
-Tara, I want you
learning this.

00:23.120 --> 00:23.920
-I'm sorry?

00:23.960 --> 00:25.039
-You're understudying Juliet.

00:25.079 --> 00:26.199
Ah, Zach.

00:26.239 --> 00:27.440
-Who's understudying Romeo?

00:27.480 --> 00:29.359
-I've never choried a film
before, so it'll be

00:29.399 --> 00:30.160
interesting.

00:30.199 --> 00:31.640
-Can I guess the storyline?

00:31.679 --> 00:33.320
Bad boy from the wrong
side of the tracks

00:33.359 --> 00:34.600
meets ballet princess?

00:34.640 --> 00:35.240
-No, no--

00:35.280 --> 00:36.359
I'm not auditioning.

00:36.399 --> 00:37.359
-Keep reading the lead.

00:37.399 --> 00:38.600
You're doing well with her.

00:41.759 --> 00:43.600
[theme music]

01:32.239 --> 01:34.560
NARRATOR: Once upon a time,
some good little boys and

01:34.599 --> 01:37.239
girls set out on a
big adventure.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.120
Every night, they performed
in all the

01:39.159 --> 01:41.200
theaters across the land.

01:41.239 --> 01:44.400
And for a while, the tour
was fairly predictable.

01:44.439 --> 01:47.640
There was pretty dancing.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.280
There was academy politics.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.159
The usual who likes who,
blah, blah, blah.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.280
And then, something
magical happened.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.599
The further they traveled from
home, the more these girls and

02:12.639 --> 02:14.319
boys began to change.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.680
-Viva la tour.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.159
-Viva la tour.

02:18.199 --> 02:20.800
NARRATOR: To reinvent
themselves--

02:20.840 --> 02:23.159
-[cat call]

02:23.199 --> 02:25.639
NARRATOR: --until the old rules
didn't matter anymore.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.400
-Viva la tour.

02:32.439 --> 02:34.199
-Viva la tour.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.800
NARRATOR: The open road had
united them as open roads are

02:36.840 --> 02:38.199
wont to do.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.120
And for the first time, one
little girl had found the

02:46.159 --> 02:47.719
place to call her home.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.759
-I remember the heady freedom
of tour, and I want you guys

02:57.800 --> 02:59.039
to have fun.

02:59.080 --> 03:04.039
But that was an insult to
us and to the audience.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.400
Until you guys can start acting
like professionals, all

03:06.439 --> 03:08.840
parts are officially
up for grabs.

03:08.879 --> 03:14.319
Any more slip-ups on or off
stage, you will be recast.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.159
-He's bluffing.

03:16.199 --> 03:17.080
-All right, that's it.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.319
Stop the bus.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.599
-Maybe he's not bluffing.

03:23.639 --> 03:26.719
-Welcome to Ballinger, home of
the great Dawn Challenge and

03:26.759 --> 03:28.319
the most sacred academy
tradition.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.479
-A tradition I'm officially
banning.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.639
-Don't stress, Zach.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.319
I'll keep the kids in line.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.680
-It's a nudie run, right?

03:34.719 --> 03:36.159
-Well, the Dawn Challenge
is a lot more than

03:36.199 --> 03:36.960
just a nudie run.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.759
It requires cunning, skill.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.039
-Which is why you got
sprung last year.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.159
-Precious memories--

03:42.199 --> 03:43.639
are there always this
many flies?

03:47.599 --> 03:49.800
-We should grab some time to
go over the pas de deux.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.039
-I already know Juliet.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.479
Ben and I have rehearsed
it together.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.319
-Well, it's not going to
be useful if I get

03:57.360 --> 03:58.520
bumped up to Romeo.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.360
-The whole '80s plot
sounds so lame.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.600
I mean, it's hardly going
to be center stage.

04:16.639 --> 04:18.160
-Hey, whoa, you're extras.

04:18.199 --> 04:20.480
You don't eat until everyone
else has, OK?

04:20.519 --> 04:25.439
First talent, then crew,
and then you, got it?

04:25.480 --> 04:27.720
-I haven't eaten a thing.

04:27.759 --> 04:28.480
-You're talent.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.680
You're allowed to eat.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.199
And you do realize I've
been looking for you?

04:31.240 --> 04:32.639
-Oh, sorry, yeah,
I wasn't sure.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.480
-My name is Jamie.

04:33.519 --> 04:34.759
I'm the third AD.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.079
In future, questions, problems,
anything, you come

04:38.120 --> 04:39.800
to me first, all right?

04:39.839 --> 04:43.160
-Great, I'd love a
coconut water.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.399
MALE SPEAKER (ON WALKIE TALKIE):
Hey, what's your 20?

04:44.439 --> 04:45.759
-We're traveling.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.319
-The whereabouts of the lead
actors is your sole

04:48.360 --> 04:49.680
responsibility.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.160
I'm guessing they didn't teach
you that at film school.

04:52.199 --> 04:53.000
-Sorry.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.480
-It's not your fault, darling.

04:55.519 --> 04:57.160
Now, we have a nice, easy
visual scene for

04:57.199 --> 04:58.519
you to start with.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.600
What I'd like you to do is enter
through the door, cross

05:01.639 --> 05:05.120
to the bar, throw down your bag,
and put your hair up, OK?

05:05.160 --> 05:05.639
-OK.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.160
-That simple.

05:06.199 --> 05:07.000
-Sure.

05:07.040 --> 05:07.600
-Do you want to give it a go?

05:07.639 --> 05:08.120
-Yeah.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.120
-OK--

05:11.399 --> 05:12.560
action.

05:21.519 --> 05:22.519
There it is--

05:22.560 --> 05:23.720
we have a natural.

05:23.759 --> 05:24.680
-Really?

05:24.720 --> 05:27.160
-We should've shot
the rehearsal.

05:27.199 --> 05:29.519
Just remember, it's the morning
after you caught Paul

05:29.560 --> 05:33.199
breaking into the studio,
so you're rattled, OK?

05:33.240 --> 05:33.800
-Rattled--

05:33.839 --> 05:35.160
can do.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.439
-Cut--

05:40.480 --> 05:42.240
it's looking good.

05:42.279 --> 05:43.240
-Set.

05:43.279 --> 05:45.839
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Action.

05:45.879 --> 05:46.800
-Ah, forgot my bag.

05:46.839 --> 05:47.360
-Cut.

05:47.399 --> 05:48.639
-Mark it.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.839
-Action.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.560
-Cut.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.319
-Sorry.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.720
-But we emailed the
confirmation.

06:01.759 --> 06:03.160
-Fully booked, I'm afraid.

06:03.199 --> 06:04.519
-We come at this time
every year.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.800
-Oh, I know.

06:05.839 --> 06:08.560
Dawn Challenge, 1993--

06:08.600 --> 06:11.319
you don't forget glutes
like that.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.759
You fancy pants ballet types
waltz in here causing all

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
sorts of trouble.

06:15.839 --> 06:17.480
-Hi, Barb?

06:17.519 --> 06:21.240
Grace Whitney, Prix de
Fontaine ambassador.

06:21.279 --> 06:24.360
I'm sorry, how big
is that trout?

06:24.399 --> 06:25.680
ZACH (OFFSCREEN): Grace.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.639
-I'm more of a spinner
fisherwoman myself, so I've

06:28.680 --> 06:30.639
never caught anything
of that caliber.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.519
-You were in love with the bugs
and the nature when we

06:32.560 --> 06:33.920
were hiking through Catabria.

06:33.959 --> 06:37.480
Were you pretending to have
fun, trying to impress me?

06:37.519 --> 06:39.279
-No, and I'm having fun now.

06:39.319 --> 06:40.720
-Mhmm?

06:40.759 --> 06:42.160
-If you weren't here, I'd be
having the time of my life.

06:42.199 --> 06:46.279
-I bet you are the president of
the local fishing society.

06:46.319 --> 06:48.439
-Some call me The
Fish Whisperer.

06:54.279 --> 06:55.360
-It feels wrong.

06:55.399 --> 06:56.800
Romeo is Ben's role.

06:56.839 --> 06:59.800
-Ms. Pie Chart, this
is a turnaround.

06:59.839 --> 07:01.759
You're always on at
me about trying.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.480
And now here I am.

07:03.519 --> 07:04.600
I'm abandoned.

07:04.639 --> 07:06.240
-That was a long time ago.

07:06.279 --> 07:09.160
-Oh, so you don't want to help
me get into the company?

07:09.199 --> 07:10.639
You're putting your boyfriend
above one

07:10.680 --> 07:12.160
of your oldest friends?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.240
-Friends?

07:13.279 --> 07:14.480
How many calls did you
ignore over the

07:14.519 --> 07:16.120
holidays, how many texts?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.800
I spent months worried
about you.

07:17.839 --> 07:19.800
And-- and when I found you,
the door was pretty much

07:19.839 --> 07:22.160
slammed in my face,
so let's not

07:22.199 --> 07:23.399
pretend that we're friends.

07:34.439 --> 07:35.560
-I promise--

07:35.600 --> 07:38.480
every word, every comma,
committed to memory.

07:38.519 --> 07:41.639
-That's great, but Reese has
asked if we can keep it loose,

07:41.680 --> 07:43.199
play around with it, OK?

07:43.240 --> 07:44.439
-Sure.

07:47.839 --> 07:49.040
-Slide 12, take one.

07:49.079 --> 07:51.240
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Mark it, camera set.

07:51.279 --> 07:53.480
-And action.

07:53.519 --> 07:56.800
-Wait, you don't actually
dance, do you?

08:03.560 --> 08:06.800
Or you actually do dance.

08:20.639 --> 08:23.680
-You think you know who I am?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.439
We've lived in the same town our
entire lives, and you have

08:26.480 --> 08:30.279
never said one word to me
since kindergarten.

08:30.319 --> 08:33.279
-I haven't?

08:33.320 --> 08:37.480
-I mean, why would the Princess
of Gladdy High dain

08:37.519 --> 08:40.200
to talk to the weird kid
with the dead brother?

08:44.360 --> 08:48.240
Yeah, I'm a freak,
and I dance.

08:48.279 --> 08:49.480
So deal with it, Tamsin.

08:52.639 --> 08:53.559
[cell phone ringing]

08:53.600 --> 08:55.600
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:55.639 --> 08:58.519
I'm sorry, oh, sorry everyone.

08:58.559 --> 08:59.759
-Cut.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.639
[laughing]

09:06.679 --> 09:07.440
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Ben--

09:07.480 --> 09:09.600
Ben, seriously.

09:09.639 --> 09:11.039
-All right, dare.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.639
-The, ah, blister below your
ingrown toenail looks yummy.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.679
-Zach is serious about
the role-swap thing.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.799
All of you out.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.399
-Miss Grace, you will
to a party.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.120
Plus, your room is furthest
from Zach's.

09:24.159 --> 09:26.519
-Don't, don't, don't,
that is disgusting.

09:26.559 --> 09:31.159
-[screaming]

09:31.200 --> 09:32.360
-News flash--

09:32.399 --> 09:34.200
you guys aren't as quiet
as you think you are.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.639
-Wes, you're being
teacher again.

09:35.679 --> 09:36.799
-Adult.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.159
-What are these juvenile
shenanigans anyway?

09:41.679 --> 09:44.240
-Abigail, truth, dare, or--

09:44.279 --> 09:45.440
-Pash.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.639
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Mm, good kisser, Tara.

10:00.679 --> 10:01.720
I enjoyed that.

10:01.759 --> 10:03.080
-Who's up for fun?

10:11.840 --> 10:12.879
-I wrapped you two hours ago.

10:12.919 --> 10:16.480
You're not getting overtime
for this.

10:16.519 --> 10:19.159
-I have to dance and
act tomorrow.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.639
Be really bad for
my self-esteem

10:20.679 --> 10:22.559
if I sucked at both.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.759
-Yeah, we wouldn't want that.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.120
-From an assistant director, I'm
not really feeling a lot

10:29.159 --> 10:30.279
of assistance.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.399
-What, you want me to
tell you the Oscar's

10:31.440 --> 10:33.039
in the bag, do you?

10:33.080 --> 10:35.399
You're an unknown who's been
given the lead because you're

10:35.440 --> 10:39.159
pretty and you can
dance a bit.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.559
-So--

10:41.600 --> 10:45.200
-So my short film won People's
Choice Award at Tropfest.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.600
And now, I'm taking the flak
when non-actors are too dumb

10:47.639 --> 10:48.639
to turn their phones off.

10:48.679 --> 10:49.840
I wouldn't be complaining.

10:53.440 --> 10:53.919
-Whoa.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.159
-Let's do it.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.200
-Ben, stop.

10:56.240 --> 10:56.840
Call truth.

10:56.879 --> 10:57.799
-Let the man alone.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.200
-Yeah Tara, Christian
dared him.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.320
He has to.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.679
-T. Web, the Benster
does not wimp.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.039
-Yes.

11:19.240 --> 11:19.639
-Yes.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.200
-Score.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.399
-Pash.

11:29.679 --> 11:41.480
-[laughing]

11:41.519 --> 11:44.480
-Pash.

11:44.519 --> 11:45.679
-Yes.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.039
-OK.

11:52.559 --> 11:53.759
-Pash.

11:58.679 --> 12:01.639
-Well, aren't I Ms. Popular.

12:01.679 --> 12:05.399
-OK, I haven't had
a go in ages.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.200
Yep, yep--

12:09.240 --> 12:13.399
finally, finally you
are so dead.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.799
-That's cheating.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.639
If you're not playing by the
rules, I'm going to bed--

12:16.679 --> 12:17.480
stupid.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.039
[knocking]

12:19.080 --> 12:21.039
-Hide, hide--

12:21.080 --> 12:22.480
just a minute.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.720
Zach, you do know there's
a curfew.

12:39.679 --> 12:40.559
-You owe me a dare.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.519
That dare's the Dawn
Challenge.

12:41.559 --> 12:43.600
-Right, how about
you step it up.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.799
If I do it, you have to pretend
to be sick so I get

12:45.840 --> 12:47.080
Romeo in tomorrow's
performance.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.600
-Dude, I'm not just going
to let you take my role.

12:48.639 --> 12:50.159
-Oh finally, thank you.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.320
-We both do the challenge.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.759
Winner takes all.

12:52.799 --> 12:54.600
-Can't you see what
he's doing?

12:54.639 --> 12:55.600
You've already got Romeo.

12:55.639 --> 12:56.279
You win nothing.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.320
-Ahh, except victory.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.360
-They invaded my room.

13:01.399 --> 13:03.159
I'm an innocent bystander.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.600
-We both know that's
never the case.

13:05.639 --> 13:08.320
-Zach, if you're still holding
a grudge over what happened

13:08.360 --> 13:09.600
last year--

13:09.639 --> 13:11.200
-Ms. Raine asked me to keep
a strict eye on you.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.639
You know why?

13:12.679 --> 13:14.600
Because every time you're
allowed to cross the line, it

13:14.639 --> 13:16.600
just feeds the problem.

13:16.639 --> 13:19.080
-You're not even going to
acknowledge I've changed?

13:19.120 --> 13:20.799
-I hope you have.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.720
Because this is your
final warning.

13:22.759 --> 13:25.799
Any more stuff ups, and
you're off the tour--

13:25.840 --> 13:27.440
last chance, Grace.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.639
-You said that already.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.679
-Rule one--

13:41.720 --> 13:46.240
all competitors must start nude
apart from your phone.

13:46.279 --> 13:48.240
Rule two--

13:48.279 --> 13:53.039
each of you must acquire three
items of clothing.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.840
And finally, photograph yourself
grabbing a coin from

13:55.879 --> 13:58.240
the Main Street fountain.

13:58.279 --> 14:01.399
First one back without getting
caught will go

14:01.440 --> 14:04.799
down in academy folklore.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.519
Dawn challengers,
are you ready?

14:07.559 --> 14:09.120
-Viva la tour.

14:13.879 --> 14:14.480
-Go.

14:14.519 --> 14:20.320
-[cheering]

14:40.120 --> 14:43.039
-Cheers,

14:43.080 --> 14:46.080
-Goodness sake, let's get you
some clothes so you can give

14:46.120 --> 14:47.320
Gilbert a rest.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.279
-Let's roll.

14:55.320 --> 15:05.320
-Credit card number 75096601.

15:05.360 --> 15:10.600
-Credit card number 75096601.

15:10.639 --> 15:12.039
-I drowned my phone.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.320
-Quick, grab a coin.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.320
Hold still.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.159
[police siren]

15:18.200 --> 15:19.759
-I am not going to jail.

15:19.799 --> 15:20.600
I'm too pretty.

15:20.639 --> 15:21.279
Here, I'll take one of you.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.399
-There's no time, go.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.480
-I'm not leaving you here.

15:23.519 --> 15:26.200
-Doug, I'm right behind
you-- go.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.320
-Hey, I know where you live.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.639
-Morning Barb, officer--

15:30.679 --> 15:33.159
there a problem?

15:33.200 --> 15:37.679
-Apart from bylaw 735c, no
dancing in the fountain,

15:37.720 --> 15:39.159
where's my trout?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.440
-Barb, you know I'm
a fish lover.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.840
This is all just a big
misunderstanding.

16:03.440 --> 16:17.799
-[cheering]

16:40.879 --> 16:41.840
-Heels down--

16:41.879 --> 16:45.600
it's chasse, coupe,
petit assemble.

16:45.639 --> 16:48.080
-Oy, you two, zip it.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.039
Can't you see people are trying
to work around here?

16:50.080 --> 16:52.600
-Hey, you are not the
most important

16:52.639 --> 16:53.720
person on the planet.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.320
You just have a walkie talkie.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.120
-Excuse me?

16:57.159 --> 16:59.240
-Yes, OK, they're annoying.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.799
But they've been here
since 5:00 AM

17:00.840 --> 17:02.480
trying to get it right.

17:02.519 --> 17:03.519
Because they're dancers.

17:03.559 --> 17:05.039
And that's what we do.

17:05.079 --> 17:08.160
Apart from telling people when
and when not to eat, I have no

17:08.200 --> 17:09.598
idea what you're contributing.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.118
-Kat, a word.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.358
-I know, I'm sorry.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.799
I'm a disaster.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.598
I completely understand if
you want to replace me.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.598
-Kat, is there something or
someone making things

17:24.640 --> 17:26.200
difficult for you?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.599
Because you're an invaluable
part of this film.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.359
Jamie's not.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.240
So if you want him gone--

17:30.279 --> 17:32.599
-No, no, no--

17:32.640 --> 17:36.640
Jamie's fine, prickly, fine.

17:39.599 --> 17:42.480
-I understand.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.200
-Yes.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.039
-You don't have to.

17:44.079 --> 17:44.839
-I don't deserve Romeo anyway.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.839
I left a soldier behind.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.160
-I'm sorry, officer,
and again, thank

17:49.200 --> 17:50.359
you for your time.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.039
My wife called me
this morning.

17:55.079 --> 17:57.480
Sweetheart, your family misses
you, but we understand you

17:57.519 --> 17:59.480
made a commitment
to this tour.

17:59.519 --> 18:01.799
I ask, you don't listen.

18:01.839 --> 18:04.079
I threaten, and you
get arrested.

18:04.119 --> 18:05.319
Tara, congratulations--

18:05.359 --> 18:07.319
you're going on for Juliet.

18:07.359 --> 18:12.559
-Zach, I'm sorry but
told you, Peter.

18:12.599 --> 18:13.799
-Seriously?

18:16.160 --> 18:18.400
-Fine, understudy,
you across Romeo?

18:18.440 --> 18:19.640
-Yeah.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.079
-Right, you're now
alternating.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.599
-Ah, Wes, my workload
just skyrocketed.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.240
Do you still want me
as your soloist?

18:34.279 --> 18:36.119
-Ah, absolutely--

18:36.160 --> 18:38.039
you strong like ox.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.799
-Wow, you really charmed
everyone.

18:45.839 --> 18:48.240
-This is your real version
of fun, isn't it?

18:48.279 --> 18:51.200
Attack, retreat, make
them chase you--

18:51.240 --> 18:52.400
it's cute.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.640
But I'm a player from way
back, so I'll win.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.480
-I'm not playing games, Wes.

18:55.519 --> 18:57.200
I meant it when I begged
you to go back.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.519
-And when the tour's
over, I will.

18:59.559 --> 19:02.480
I really liked Abigail in
Barcelona, but that's not you,

19:02.519 --> 19:04.400
so excuse me.

19:18.599 --> 19:20.640
-I'm not sure if this
is what you meant.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.400
-Ah, thanks.

19:23.440 --> 19:28.440
-You're not the only one who's
new in feeling like a fraud.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.400
-Apparently, they liked
what I did yesterday.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.559
Pity I have no idea
what it was.

19:34.599 --> 19:37.519
-Well, they saw 500 girls at the
lead, and they cast you.

19:37.559 --> 19:38.759
So maybe run with that.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.640
-So you and Ben, that's actually
a thing, is it?

20:20.359 --> 20:21.559
-Yeah.

20:26.079 --> 20:27.480
-Sorry, I'm just--

20:27.519 --> 20:30.839
just trying to get my
head around it.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.200
-I--

20:32.240 --> 20:36.519
I didn't mean it before about
us not being friends.

20:36.559 --> 20:39.200
-That's OK, Romeo and Juliet
weren't friends.

20:43.200 --> 20:50.119
[applause]

21:39.480 --> 21:42.839
NARRATOR: A tragic fate befell
that little girl.

21:42.880 --> 21:47.400
For even though she tried so
hard and changed so much, her

21:47.440 --> 21:48.799
shadow had followed her
to the new home.

22:50.519 --> 22:52.039
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Cut.

22:52.079 --> 23:06.759
[applause]

23:06.799 --> 23:10.799
-I bet you won to challenge
back in '93, hey Zach?

23:10.839 --> 23:12.359
-Ms. Raine will meet your
bus this afternoon.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
-Zach, it wasn't just Grace.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.160
-Ben.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.119
-I thought you were sick.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.279
Grace made her choices.

23:17.319 --> 23:19.240
-You're actually sending
me home?

23:19.279 --> 23:22.039
Is your authority so tenuous you
need to make an example of

23:22.079 --> 23:22.799
big bad Grace?

23:22.839 --> 23:24.799
-I didn't want this.

23:24.839 --> 23:27.119
-This tour won't be the
same without me.

23:37.319 --> 23:39.359
Don't pretend you
don't love this.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.599
You've been trying to get
your mitts on Juliet.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.759
NARRATOR: And so nothing really
had changed at all

23:43.799 --> 23:44.599
BEN (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.559
NARRATOR: Except--

23:45.599 --> 23:48.799
-Viva la tour.

23:48.839 --> 23:50.200
NARRATOR: Maybe one thing.

23:55.519 --> 23:56.720
[theme music]
