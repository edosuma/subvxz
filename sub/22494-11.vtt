This next clip really made me
the butt of the joke!

08:44.953 --> 08:49.481
Whoo-ee!
This burrito is spicy!

08:49.516 --> 08:50.029
[gulping]

08:50.571 --> 08:52.337
Nothing beats Mexican tap water.

08:52.339 --> 08:53.540
[stomach gurgling]

08:53.542 --> 08:55.212
That was probably a mistake.

08:55.247 --> 08:57.143
[farting loudly]

09:02.217 --> 09:05.123
My asshole is still
50% scar tissue!

09:05.158 --> 09:05.519
[canned laughter]

09:05.521 --> 09:08.223
Between Montezuma's
revenge and Boy George,

09:08.224 --> 09:10.926
it was gonna happen
one way or another.

09:10.928 --> 09:14.496
Oh, come on, man, you got to
cash in that "V" card sometime!

09:14.498 --> 09:16.772
You're the only virgin
I know, bro!

09:16.733 --> 09:20.695
- Yeah, but she's so--
- Dude, it's starter [bleep]

09:20.730 --> 09:22.603
You work your way up the
food chain, I promise.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.709
Oh, uh, geez, sorry.

09:25.711 --> 09:26.944
It was my first time.

09:26.946 --> 09:28.278
Yeah, you said that.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.316
I got an early class, so...

09:30.351 --> 09:32.134
Probably too late
to put this on, huh?

09:32.184 --> 09:34.919
You didn't put-- Oh, my God!

09:34.921 --> 09:36.120
And I'm pregnant.

09:36.122 --> 09:37.455
How can you tell?

09:37.457 --> 09:39.190
Well, that's all the time I have.

09:39.726 --> 09:42.978
Yep, for your good buddy the
"Bloopers" host, you might say,

09:43.197 --> 09:43.963
time is up.

09:43.965 --> 09:46.783
For my next trick,
I'll need an assistant.

09:46.818 --> 09:49.536
Please welcome my pregnant
13-year-old daughter, Stephanie!

09:49.538 --> 09:50.303
[applause]

09:50.305 --> 09:53.406
That's right-- I was such a
good parent, God is bumping me

09:53.408 --> 09:55.775
to grandparent status way ahead
of schedule!

09:55.777 --> 09:58.816
Dad, my ankles hurt!
Please drive me home!

09:58.851 --> 10:00.915
Just as soon as Daddy commits
hari-kari, honey.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.450
Now, when I disembowel myself,

10:02.452 --> 10:04.458
you cut my head off
with the katana!

10:04.488 --> 10:06.021
[sighs] I'll be in the car.

10:06.023 --> 10:09.057
[canned laughter]

10:09.059 --> 10:10.325
Stop mocking me.

10:10.327 --> 10:12.962
[canned laughter]

10:12.964 --> 10:15.632
[distorted laughter]

10:15.634 --> 10:17.066
Stop mocking me!

10:17.068 --> 10:17.901
Dad!

10:17.903 --> 10:18.935
Coming!

10:18.937 --> 10:20.471
[clatters]

10:20.473 --> 10:22.591
[sloop!]

10:24.710 --> 10:26.589
[machine-gun fire]
