you could use this.

Oh... What's
going on out there?

12:50.354 --> 12:52.094
Uh, Julian and Hoyt
are meeting outside,

12:52.189 --> 12:54.020
they've got Roland and my mom
in the kitchen at gunpoint.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.942
Roland convinced them
to let me bring this to you,

12:56.026 --> 12:57.562
but I'm supposed
to go right back.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.188

12:59.363 --> 13:01.524
I don't know how but you're
gonna have to help
us get out of here.

I don't know,
I mean, they're
watching me pretty closely.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.943

my mom has any food.
Do you want anything?

Yeah, a sandwich would be...

Now we're gonna
tie up our prisoners.
That's the plan.

Prisoners,
that's what we are now, huh?

14:23.947 --> 14:25.778

If you'd just think about it,
you'd understand.

This is the next
logical step, Mr. Randol.

don't care about us.

right about was that

14:49.514 --> 14:50.924

for all of your
significant losses.

39:32.079 --> 39:33.785
Your grandmother,

39:34.623 --> 39:36.113
your sister.

39:37.334 --> 39:40.622
You've only got seconds.
You're gonna go to jail.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.788
(COUGHING)

39:51.890 --> 39:53.721
I'm not leaving you.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.308
Get up.
Not yet!

40:27.843 --> 40:29.253
Now I'll go.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.096
KIERA: I’m sorry.

40:43.567 --> 40:46.354
You're doing yourjob, right?
I mean...

40:49.197 --> 40:50.858
You made it sound
like it's your fault.

40:51.867 --> 40:56.031
Besides, what happened
in the future stays
in the future. Look,

40:56.913 --> 41:00.451
for what it's worth,
I forgive you.

41:04.046 --> 41:05.126
VVhy?

41:06.381 --> 41:08.372
Let me put it this way.

41:11.053 --> 41:14.386
You and I will never be able
to relate to these people

41:14.765 --> 41:16.972
the way that we
relate to each other.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.387
The two of us are in
on a joke that eight

41:19.561 --> 41:21.267
billion others on
the planet won't ever get.

41:24.066 --> 41:26.432
I can think of a few
others that might get it.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.900
Forget about
them for a second.

41:34.910 --> 41:35.990
You know I'm right.

41:38.455 --> 41:40.616
Why else would you be here?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.581
Getting drunk.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.925
I'm married.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.467
There you're married.
Here you're alone.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.971
Like me.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.767
Tomorrow's not promised,
Kiera.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.438
Maybe it's best

42:11.613 --> 42:15.606
to stop living for a future
that might not even happen.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.110
(PHONE RINGING)

42:31.967 --> 42:33.127
Hello?

42:33.468 --> 42:35.550
MAN:
Do you recognize my voice?

42:36.847 --> 42:37.927
Yes.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.003
Stay where you are.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.299
Within the hour
lwill have
someone pick you up.

42:43.145 --> 42:47.058
They will give
you clothes and food
and a safe place to stay.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.355
Then we will meet.
