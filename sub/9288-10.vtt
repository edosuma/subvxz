00:13.264 --> 00:17.334
There are terrorists planning to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:17.701 --> 00:20.638
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

00:20.838 --> 00:25.209
And the people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.342 --> 00:30.714
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
This, is the longest day of my life.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.210
This is Dave Thompson
in Jet Copter Three.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.413
It's just 9:00 on Primary Day
in Southern California.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.916
Freeways are looking pretty good.

00:49.383 --> 00:53.921
Usual delays in the Sepulveda Pass
southbound, but it loosens up at Culver.

00:54.121 --> 00:57.424
We'll have a complete report in six minutes.
Back to you, Bill.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.726
Thanks, Dave.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.645
In the news, we haven't learned
any more about the incident...

01:01.845 --> 01:06.433
...at the San Clarita power plant where
Senator Palmer was rushed out this morning.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.235
We're told the Senator was unharmed...

01:08.435 --> 01:13.073
...but Secret Service and the FBI
haven't released any new information.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.442
- Get the drip started.
- I'm on it.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.946
Find me a pulse.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.952
I've got a pulse. 140/30.

01:26.453 --> 01:30.457
Pupils not reactive.
Respiration shallow. 48.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.461
Let's start two large-bore IVs, bilateral.

01:37.714 --> 01:38.966
She's lost a lot of blood.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.970
- We should start the other line.
- All right.

01:47.474 --> 01:48.976
Is it in?

01:51.979 --> 01:54.982
Ready, one, two, three.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.992
Ready?

02:05.993 --> 02:06.994
Lift!

02:25.512 --> 02:26.513
Excuse me.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.519
- I've got the door.
- Okay.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.328
Everyone...

02:41.528 --> 02:45.032
...I'm sorry to tell you that Jamey Farrell
tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.334
Fortunately, she's still alive...

02:47.534 --> 02:50.537
...and they're doing everything they
can to keep her that way.

02:52.539 --> 02:56.043
I know it won't be easy to put this out
of our minds, but we have no choice.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.046
There's still reason to believe
Senator Palmer's life is in danger...

02:59.463 --> 03:02.049
...which means we all have
to get back to work, now.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.555
- You wanna look at this?
- Not now.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.059
Call Jamey's mom, explain what happened.
Have her pick up Kyle.

03:28.575 --> 03:29.376
CTU, Myers.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.762
Hey, it's me. Hold on.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.381
- Okay.
- Did you get the car?

03:34.581 --> 03:36.917
Yes, and I got the care package, too.
Thanks.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.086
- Jack, Teri called.
- What?

03:39.286 --> 03:40.470
About 20 minutes ago.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.389
Where is She? What'd she say?

03:42.589 --> 03:45.592
I don't know. She barely had time to
say her name before she got disconnected.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.094
What happened?

03:47.594 --> 03:50.597
She didn't call back and when I tried
to redial, the number was blocked.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.099
She sounded Okay. She sounded all right.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.401
The police have thrown a net
over this entire area.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.104
There's nothing I can do to help
Teri until I get through it.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.940
Maybe you should think about
turning yourself in.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.441
- Tell your side of the story.
- No.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.328
Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive as
long as he thinks I can be useful to him.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.997
If I'm in custody, I won't be.

04:07.197 --> 04:10.617
Scan the police frequencies, see if you can
locate any of these roadblocks for me.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.002
All right.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.621
Just a minute.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.625
Okay.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.627
Jamey give you anything else?

04:20.711 --> 04:21.628
Jack...

04:22.129 --> 04:24.131
...Jamey tried to kill herself.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.135
Jack, did you hear me?

04:30.637 --> 04:31.438
Jack?

04:31.638 --> 04:34.441
Yeah, you said she tried?

04:34.641 --> 04:37.644
We sent her to County,
but it doesn't look good.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.147
Are you sure it was a suicide attempt?

04:40.347 --> 04:41.732
Yeah, she slit her wrists.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.668
Where was her son Kyle?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.621
He didn't see anything.
We've already called Jamey's mom.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.456
She's on her way to pick him up.

04:49.656 --> 04:53.160
Okay, send someone down to County to
question Jamey in case she makes it.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.163
Right now she's still our best
source of information.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.164
Okay.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.469
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

05:02.669 --> 05:04.471
They set up a road block at Montana.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.974
Nina, I could have used the heads-up here.

05:07.174 --> 05:10.177
I'm sorry, they must have set it up
before I started scanning.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.181
Find me another route.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.184
All right, give me a second to
pull up LA traffic.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.688
You go to the window. You let me
know if somebody comes.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.209
Tony, Line 3, can you get it?

05:42.409 --> 05:43.510
Almeida.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.863
Okay, it looks like roadblocks
aren't your only problem.

05:47.063 --> 05:50.217
They sent a description of you to
all the units in the area.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.721
Nina, it's Teri Bauer.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.723
Jack, hold on a minute.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.728
- Teri?
- Nina, thank God.

06:01.928 --> 06:02.529
Where are you?

06:02.729 --> 06:04.881
I don't know, but I got ahold of a phone.

06:05.081 --> 06:07.034
Okay, is Kim with you? Are you all right?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.736
Yeah, I'm fine, Kimberly's fine.
Do you know where Jack is?

06:10.237 --> 06:12.539
Yeah, listen, I'm gonna connect
you with him right now.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.242
Leave the line open as long as you
can so we can set up a trace.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.377
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.746
Have Milo set up the trace on Line 3.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.050
Jack? I've got Teri.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.253
- Patch her through.
- Mom, someone's coming.

06:27.754 --> 06:28.255
He's here!

06:28.972 --> 06:30.757
Teri?

06:34.227 --> 06:36.263
What do you want from us?

06:39.766 --> 06:42.269
I think I left my phone in here.
You seen it?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.072
No, I haven't.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.774
Jack, I've muted our side
of the conversation.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.076
Have you set up a trace on the call?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.078
Yeah. I told Teri to leave the line open.

06:51.278 --> 06:54.281
Good. Keep our side muted. I don't
want to give away this phone.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.287
You better not be lying, bitch.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.806
Bitch.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.326
They moved everything around in here.
Damn it!

07:39.526 --> 07:41.211
Rick, you see it anywhere?

07:45.215 --> 07:46.216
No.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.528
Got anything on that trace?

07:58.728 --> 08:00.680
Latitude is somewhere north of the 10.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.733
I should have a rough longitude
in a couple of minutes.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.735
Triangulating the longitude is trickier.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.741
This is Dave in Jet Copter 3.
We're seeing some congestion...

08:12.242 --> 08:15.645
...in North Hollywood at Verdugo around
the Grant Street Elementary School.

08:15.845 --> 08:19.249
Senator Palmer is due to make an
appearance there, and it looks like...

08:19.449 --> 08:22.252
...supporters and media are
hoping to catch a glimpse...

08:22.752 --> 08:26.256
...of the presidential candidate, who apparently,
is not letting this morning's incident...

08:26.456 --> 08:28.058
...interfere with his schedule.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.761
I don't understand the rationale
behind it. No, listen to me.

08:31.961 --> 08:35.239
Why? Why defend something that
you don't need to defend?

08:35.438 --> 08:38.717
Maureen Kingsley is not coming
out with the story today.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.270
- She will.
- We don't know that.

08:41.471 --> 08:43.773
Look, if not now, tomorrow.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.777
If not her, someone else.
Our son is accused of murder.

08:47.977 --> 08:49.579
- The story's too big to hide.
- Mike.

08:49.779 --> 08:54.284
He's right, Sherry. We need to control
when and how this story comes out.

08:54.484 --> 08:57.787
One hour ago, someone tried
to kill my husband.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.590
That bought us time and we should use it.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.793
The assassination attempt might
even work for us...

09:04.294 --> 09:06.596
...if we break the story about Keith.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.249
It might put the public in a more
forgiving frame of mind.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.602
- You're making a mistake.
- It's my mistake to make.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.756
No, it isn't, David, because you
didn't get here by yourself.

09:16.839 --> 09:18.758
Do not go against me on this, Sherry!

09:19.309 --> 09:20.810
Promise me.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.314
I can't promise you anything.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.177
Jack, we've got a preliminary read
on the trace. It's a pretty big area.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.147
I'm listening.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.349
North of the 10, east of the 405.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.354
Did you hear me?

10:09.359 --> 10:12.561
Yeah, that's a start.
Now get me through these cops.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.516
Your best bet is east on Thurston.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.868
I don't think you should move yet.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.670
I'll get through the net somehow.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.374
Nina, just stay on that trace and
help me find my family, please.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.333
Tony, open an extra socket for me on 1.

10:39.338 --> 10:40.640
Did you hear me?

10:40.840 --> 10:43.393
Come here for a second.
You gotta check this out.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.870
What is it?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.206
I was checking Jamey's disk to see
if I could find any e-mails.

10:56.406 --> 11:00.410
She was careful about cleaning up,
but she didn't have time for this one.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.412
That's from this morning.

11:02.612 --> 11:04.214
To an anonymous recipient.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.916
- What about the encryption?
- I'll get Milo on that.

11:07.116 --> 11:08.918
But you can still see the subject.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.422
Ted Cofell. Find out who he is.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.629
I'm busy.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.771
Yeah?

11:28.971 --> 11:30.640
I need you to do something for me.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.025
I'm working on this trace.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.945
You'll have to do two things at once.
I need this e-mail decrypted, all right?

11:42.452 --> 11:43.953
CTU, Almeida.

11:50.860 --> 11:51.861
Okay.

11:53.963 --> 11:54.964
Thanks.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.481
Nina, that was the clinic.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.350
Jamey didn't make it.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.363
Mom, it's clear. They're gone.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.165
Hello, Jack? Are you there?

12:46.365 --> 12:49.869
Teri, it's Nina. You okay to talk?
I'll put you through to Jack.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.872
Jack, I've got Teri.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.174
- Teri?
- Jack? Can you talk? Where are you?

12:55.374 --> 12:57.877
I'm on my way to get you out of
there, sweetheart. You okay?

12:58.077 --> 13:00.129
- Yeah, I'm hanging in there.
- Good, thank God.

13:00.329 --> 13:02.381
Nina's tracing the cellular signal
to your location.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.383
How long will that take?

13:04.583 --> 13:05.384
Nina?

13:06.385 --> 13:07.687
Twenty minutes.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.889
Milo's narrowed the signal
to four repeater antennas...

13:10.089 --> 13:12.808
...which is still about 500 square miles.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.393
Oh, God.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.896
Teri, don't worry, we're closing in on it.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.902
Please pull over to the curb.

13:23.102 --> 13:23.703
Jack?

13:23.903 --> 13:25.705
I'm still here, honey.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.908
Is there anything you can tell us
that might help us find you?

13:29.108 --> 13:31.744
I know we're at least a few miles
out of the city.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.830
This is gonna take me about a minute.
Hold on.

15:09.258 --> 15:11.761
11-8-19. Code 6 North.

15:31.781 --> 15:34.784
11-8-19. North sector. Nothing so far.

15:36.786 --> 15:38.788
Jack, are you all right?

15:46.295 --> 15:49.599
- Jack?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

15:49.799 --> 15:52.301
It would really help us out
if you could tell us...

15:52.501 --> 15:54.103
...everything you know about where you are.

15:54.303 --> 15:57.306
I don't know much. They blindfolded
me when they picked me up.

15:57.506 --> 16:00.109
- Where was that?
- On Mulholland, near Coldwater.

16:00.309 --> 16:03.813
How long did it take for you to get
from there to where you are now?

16:04.013 --> 16:05.815
I'm not sure. Half an hour?

16:06.015 --> 16:07.750
Surface streets or freeways?

16:07.950 --> 16:09.685
- Freeways, I think.
- Milo.

16:09.885 --> 16:10.620
Already on it.

16:10.820 --> 16:13.623
Anything else, any sounds or smells?

16:13.823 --> 16:16.325
Can you hear cars or airplanes? Anything?

16:17.326 --> 16:18.544
No, it's pretty quiet.

16:18.744 --> 16:22.189
There's hills, and some eucalyptus trees.

16:22.389 --> 16:25.835
It may be the North Valley,
somewhere inland.

16:26.035 --> 16:27.837
- It's pretty remote.
- That helps.

16:31.340 --> 16:33.643
I've got it narrowed down to three sectors.

16:33.843 --> 16:36.712
The closer we get, the longer each
iteration's gonna take.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.464
What does that mean?

16:39.348 --> 16:41.350
It's just techno-talk, Teri.

16:41.851 --> 16:44.353
Don't worry, we're making good progress.

16:50.860 --> 16:54.163
Jack, are you there?

16:54.363 --> 16:55.865
Yeah, baby, I'm still here.

16:58.868 --> 17:02.371
Teri, I'm gonna find you. I promise.

17:03.873 --> 17:04.874
I know you will.

17:06.876 --> 17:08.877
Nina's tracing the call right now.

17:09.377 --> 17:12.031
We're gonna have your location
in a couple of minutes...

17:12.231 --> 17:14.884
...but it's important you don't
hang up that phone, okay?

17:15.084 --> 17:17.920
Even if you can't talk,
don't hang up the phone.

17:20.890 --> 17:23.893
Sweetheart, are you sure you're all right?

17:25.394 --> 17:26.896
They didn't hurt you, did they?

17:28.396 --> 17:30.900
I'm fine. So is Kim.

17:31.901 --> 17:34.403
- Is she there with you?
- Yeah, she's right here.

17:37.406 --> 17:40.409
Put her on the phone
so both of you can hear.

17:40.609 --> 17:41.410
Okay.

17:46.415 --> 17:47.416
Dad?

17:48.918 --> 17:50.419
Hey, sweetheart.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.221
You okay?

17:52.421 --> 17:55.324
Yeah. Who are these guys?
Why are they doing this?

17:55.524 --> 17:58.427
I don't know honey, but I'm
gonna find out, I promise.

17:58.928 --> 18:02.431
Right now I just want to make sure that
you and Mommy get home safely, okay?

18:03.933 --> 18:06.936
Honey, look...

18:08.938 --> 18:11.941
...I know I haven't always been
there when you've needed me.

18:12.141 --> 18:13.242
You don't have to do this.

18:13.442 --> 18:16.737
I want both of you to know
that I'm here for you now.

18:16.937 --> 18:20.032
I love you more than
anything in the whole world...

18:20.232 --> 18:23.953
...and I promise you, I am gonna
get you both out of there, okay?

18:25.955 --> 18:28.958
So no matter what happens, don't give up.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.461
We're a family, we're gonna get
through this like a family.

18:33.996 --> 18:34.964
Okay?

18:37.466 --> 18:39.969
Sweetie, don't forget,
I'm coming to get you.

18:46.475 --> 18:50.980
Sweetheart, stay on the phone.
I'm gonna be right back.

19:21.510 --> 19:24.013
- Honey, you still there?
- Mom, he's coming back.

19:24.513 --> 19:26.015
Jack, I need to get off the phone.
He's coming back.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.517
Who's coming? Teri, keep the line open.

19:30.519 --> 19:32.187
Dude, it's just a phone.

19:32.521 --> 19:34.523
It's how Gaines gets ahold of
me when he needs me.

19:35.024 --> 19:36.525
You already looked here.

19:40.029 --> 19:41.030
Where is it?

19:41.530 --> 19:43.032
I told you, I don't know.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.953
- Where's my phone?
- She doesn't know either.

19:50.039 --> 19:53.042
Stay away from her.
Stop it! What are you doing?

19:53.242 --> 19:54.343
Don't you touch her!

19:54.543 --> 19:55.845
Can't speak for yourself?

19:56.045 --> 19:57.546
I don't know where your stupid...

19:57.996 --> 20:01.550
Don't hurt her. Come on! Take it easy!

20:15.064 --> 20:17.066
- Nina, what's going on?
- I don't know.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.069
The signal's dying.

20:37.586 --> 20:38.587
Who'd you call?

20:42.591 --> 20:44.593
Who is this?

20:45.094 --> 20:49.098
I'm the last thing that you'll ever see if
anything happens to my wife or my daughter.

20:51.100 --> 20:51.901
Where you going?

20:52.101 --> 20:53.903
To tell Gaines they called for help.

20:54.103 --> 20:57.439
What do you think he's gonna do when
he finds out they used your phone?

20:57.639 --> 21:00.109
Jack, get us out of here, please. Hurry!

21:01.560 --> 21:03.529
Teri, I'm going to find you. I promise.

21:07.116 --> 21:09.618
Think about it. They called on your phone.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.630
Nina.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.634
Tell me you got that trace.

21:28.637 --> 21:29.638
We didn't get it.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.988
We've located Bauer's car.

22:40.709 --> 22:42.227
Nina, it's Jack. You still there?

22:42.427 --> 22:43.321
What's happening, Jack?

22:43.727 --> 22:47.715
I got a car.
How close did Milo get with the trace?

22:48.050 --> 22:49.218
Twenty-five mile radius.

22:49.718 --> 22:51.220
- Damn it, that's not good enough.
- Sorry.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.723
Look, I've gotta do something. Come on,
Nina, anything, please help me out.

22:54.923 --> 22:56.525
What about Jamey?

22:56.725 --> 22:58.027
She didn't make it, Jack.

22:58.227 --> 23:01.730
I don't believe this. Nina, please,
I've got to find them.

23:01.930 --> 23:02.731
Hold on.

23:03.232 --> 23:05.234
Did you get anything yet
with that e-mail address?

23:05.734 --> 23:08.237
- Yeah, it's coming through now.
- Patch into Line 2.

23:10.239 --> 23:11.540
Hey, Jack, it's Tony.

23:11.740 --> 23:14.243
I found something on Jamey's
computer that might be a lead.

23:14.443 --> 23:15.544
What?

23:15.744 --> 23:18.547
The name, Ted Cofell.
I did a search of LA...

23:18.747 --> 23:23.252
...and found Ted Cofell as a CEO of
an investment banking firm in Burbank.

23:23.452 --> 23:24.136
That's it?

23:24.336 --> 23:25.554
- So far..
- There's something..

23:25.754 --> 23:28.557
Hold on. Speak one at a time.
Tony, you go first.

23:28.757 --> 23:32.411
So far that's it. We have Milo
decoding the e-mail right now.

23:32.611 --> 23:36.265
Fine. I'm gonna head to Cofell's office.
What's the address?

23:37.766 --> 23:39.668
It's 21500 Riverside Drive.

23:39.868 --> 23:41.570
21500 Riverside Drive, fine.

23:41.770 --> 23:44.073
Tony, Gaines is gonna probably
try to contact Jamey.

23:44.273 --> 23:47.276
He doesn't know she's dead. Make
sure you keep it that way, okay?

23:47.476 --> 23:49.278
Nina, you help me navigate through traffic.

23:49.478 --> 23:50.779
All right.

24:08.297 --> 24:09.431
Gaines.

24:09.631 --> 24:10.766
Hello, Ira.

24:13.302 --> 24:15.954
Mr. Drazen. Where are you?

24:16.154 --> 24:18.607
Flying into Los Angeles.

24:18.807 --> 24:23.312
I'd like to know why the David Palmer
situation hasn't been taken care of.

24:23.512 --> 24:26.315
I don't have to tell you, my brother
and I are very disappointed.

24:26.732 --> 24:29.318
We had some bad luck, that's all.

24:29.568 --> 24:33.822
Bad luck or bad management, we have
every reason to void the contract.

24:34.022 --> 24:35.124
There's no need for that.

24:35.324 --> 24:39.661
To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer
in the same city on the same day...

24:39.861 --> 24:43.632
...and let them slip through our
fingers would be intolerable.

24:43.832 --> 24:47.836
Don't worry. Palmer will be dead by
the end of the day, just as we agreed.

24:48.036 --> 24:49.338
How?

24:49.838 --> 24:52.641
We still have Bauer's family as leverage.

24:52.841 --> 24:56.244
We'll find Bauer and use him,
just like we did before.

24:56.444 --> 24:59.848
If plan 'A' doesn't work,
you should have a plan 'B'.

25:00.048 --> 25:02.151
Not plan 'A' recycled.

25:02.351 --> 25:04.853
Like I said, we still have his family.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.857
If we sit tight, there's a good
chance Bauer will find us.

25:09.057 --> 25:12.161
Then we'll make him the
scapegoat, just as before.

25:12.361 --> 25:15.864
My brother wants me to assess
the situation personally.

25:16.064 --> 25:20.369
I land in half an hour.
I'll join you by 10:30.

25:20.569 --> 25:21.670
Suit yourself.

25:21.870 --> 25:25.374
If I don't see a substantial
improvement in things in the next hour...

25:25.574 --> 25:28.877
...I'm going to ask Mr. Cofell
to empty the accounts.

25:29.077 --> 25:30.379
You will get zero.

25:30.879 --> 25:33.682
Mr. Drazen...

25:33.882 --> 25:37.386
You may be in this for the money,
but for my family, it's personal.

25:38.887 --> 25:40.889
- I realize that.
- Then realize this.

25:42.391 --> 25:43.692
If things continue to go wrong...

25:43.892 --> 25:47.396
...the money isn't all you'll lose.
You understand?

25:51.900 --> 25:53.702
- This is Sherry Palmer.
- Hello, Sherry.

25:53.902 --> 25:56.905
I'm sure you're just as surprised
as I am that I'm calling you.

25:57.105 --> 25:59.708
I'm only surprised you waited this long.

25:59.908 --> 26:03.412
I assume you're calling because David
still plans to make the announcement...

26:03.612 --> 26:06.415
...about Keith, and you can't stop him.

26:06.615 --> 26:08.717
So, now you want me to stop him?

26:08.917 --> 26:11.920
You've lost whatever influence
you once had with David...

26:12.120 --> 26:14.189
...so I'm sure that's gonna be a problem.

26:14.389 --> 26:16.425
But you might be able
to stop Maureen Kingsley.

26:16.925 --> 26:17.726
How?

26:17.926 --> 26:22.114
I don't know. I'm sure she has
a weakness somewhere.

26:22.314 --> 26:26.435
Look, Carl, you don't need to ask
me for any advice on stuff like this.

26:26.935 --> 26:30.439
As a matter of fact, I've already taken
care of the evidence against Keith.

26:33.442 --> 26:36.745
Taken care of it? How?

26:36.945 --> 26:38.947
That's all you really need to know.

26:40.949 --> 26:43.585
I'm not sure I'm understanding you.

26:43.785 --> 26:45.254
You don't have to.

26:45.454 --> 26:50.175
But if we give David a way out
of this, make sure he takes it.

27:00.802 --> 27:02.271
- Got it.
- Send it to me.

27:02.471 --> 27:06.975
A wire transfer to Ira Gaines at 2:10 this
morning from a Swiss account: $1,000,000.

27:07.175 --> 27:09.478
What does Cofell have to do with this?

27:09.978 --> 27:11.396
I don't know. Maybe it was his money.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.482
It makes sense. Cofell's in finance.

27:17.486 --> 27:18.787
Yeah, it's Jack.

27:18.987 --> 27:20.989
Jack, looks like we have the right Cofell.

27:21.189 --> 27:22.290
Good. What have you got on him?

27:23.992 --> 27:26.995
All right. Born in Philadelphia.
Went to Colgate.

27:27.195 --> 27:28.797
MBA from UCLA in '88.

27:28.997 --> 27:33.001
Worked in investment banking, started
his own firm about five years ago.

27:33.201 --> 27:34.886
Net worth is in excess of $35 million.

27:35.136 --> 27:37.389
Okay, good, patch me through to his office.

27:41.510 --> 27:42.778
Cofell Enterprises.

27:42.978 --> 27:44.012
Hi, is Ted there, please?

27:44.513 --> 27:46.515
Mr. Cofell's in a meeting.
May I take a message?

27:46.715 --> 27:47.816
I'm a friend from business school.

27:48.016 --> 27:50.319
I'm in town today. I was hoping
we could get together.

27:50.519 --> 27:53.404
As soon as he's out of the meeting,
he's going out of town.

27:53.604 --> 27:56.290
That's too bad. How much longer will he
be in his office?

27:56.490 --> 27:59.994
He plans to leave by 10:00.
Would you like to leave your name?

28:01.495 --> 28:02.496
Hello?

28:13.407 --> 28:15.909
Tell Milo to be ready
in case Teri calls back.

28:17.411 --> 28:20.714
Nina, Division gave me a heads-up.

28:20.914 --> 28:23.834
They're sending in a provisional
replacement for Jack.

28:25.919 --> 28:28.422
They didn't waste any time, did they?

28:29.423 --> 28:30.874
Who is it?

28:31.425 --> 28:32.926
Alberta Green.

28:34.428 --> 28:36.430
Didn't she work for you over at Division?

28:36.630 --> 28:38.932
Yes, she did. When's she coming?

28:39.132 --> 28:41.435
Scheduled to arrive at 9:45.

28:42.436 --> 28:43.437
Okay.

28:47.441 --> 28:48.242
CTU, Myers.

28:48.442 --> 28:50.744
Cofell's there, but he's leaving at 10:00.

28:50.944 --> 28:53.447
I'm passing Culver. What's the
traffic like moving east?

28:53.647 --> 28:55.065
Hang on, I'll check.

28:57.451 --> 28:59.753
Jack, there's another thing.

28:59.953 --> 29:03.457
They're bringing in Alberta Green
to run things.

29:03.657 --> 29:05.626
She's gonna be here in a few minutes.

29:05.959 --> 29:09.463
Damn it! Whatever, look, we'll deal with it.

29:09.663 --> 29:11.465
Tell me how to get out of this traffic.

29:11.665 --> 29:13.467
You'll hit gridlock in about two miles.

29:13.667 --> 29:14.768
How is Riverside?

29:14.968 --> 29:18.772
It's a little better.
You might want to get off.

29:18.972 --> 29:21.809
I'm getting off at the next exit.
I'm gonna cut over.

29:25.479 --> 29:28.482
Mom, tell me what happened
between you and Dad.

29:30.484 --> 29:31.985
Why did he move out?

29:34.488 --> 29:35.989
Kim, let's not talk about this now.

29:36.189 --> 29:37.991
Why not?

29:38.492 --> 29:41.278
I mean, we both know
there might not be a later.

29:41.478 --> 29:42.946
- Kim
- Please, Mom.

29:44.998 --> 29:46.950
I wanna know.

29:57.010 --> 30:00.013
I think your father is the
best man that I've ever known.

30:02.516 --> 30:06.019
But he can be difficult...

30:07.521 --> 30:09.523
...and his job doesn't help.

30:13.026 --> 30:17.030
You remember a couple of years ago,
when he went away for a few weeks?

30:19.032 --> 30:21.034
Yeah, for some.. training thing.

30:22.035 --> 30:25.038
That's what he told us,
but I'm sure it was a mission.

30:27.374 --> 30:29.543
He wouldn't say, and maybe he
probably couldn't.

30:31.545 --> 30:34.047
Anyway, when he came back, he was...

30:36.550 --> 30:37.351
...different.

30:37.551 --> 30:41.555
He was distant and preoccupied...

30:42.055 --> 30:45.058
...and other times he was just angry.

30:47.845 --> 30:50.564
He did everything he could
to keep it from you...

30:53.066 --> 30:57.070
...but things between us weren't so great.

30:59.072 --> 31:01.575
I suppose I could have been more patient.

31:06.580 --> 31:09.583
So we decided to try being apart.

31:12.586 --> 31:14.588
But it didn't work.

31:16.089 --> 31:17.090
No.

31:21.094 --> 31:22.546
Good.

31:25.599 --> 31:28.101
I just want us to be together again.

31:43.116 --> 31:47.621
Cofell is taking a private plane and we got
a copy of his flight plan from the FAA.

31:47.821 --> 31:49.122
He's going to Denver.

31:50.657 --> 31:52.676
- What does that tell us?
- We're not sure.

31:52.876 --> 31:57.130
We're checking people in the Denver area
who have known terrorist connections.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.132
So far we haven't got much.

32:15.649 --> 32:17.651
- Hello, Nina.
- Hello, Alberta.

32:18.018 --> 32:20.654
Nice to see you. You know why I'm here.

32:20.854 --> 32:21.688
Yes.

32:23.156 --> 32:25.158
Gather everyone around, will you?

32:27.160 --> 32:30.163
Could everyone stop what they're
doing for just a moment?

32:30.363 --> 32:31.965
I have something to tell you.

32:32.165 --> 32:34.968
I'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green.

32:35.168 --> 32:39.322
Jack Bauer has been relieved of his
duties here indefinitely.

32:39.522 --> 32:43.677
In the meantime, Alberta's been
appointed Acting Director of CTU.

32:45.679 --> 32:49.683
Good morning. Things have been
out of control here today.

32:49.883 --> 32:52.986
Starting now, they're back in control.

32:53.186 --> 32:57.691
Most of you know an attempt was made
on Senator Palmer at 8:00 this morning.

32:58.191 --> 33:03.280
You may not know that Jack Bauer was
apparently involved in that attempt.

33:03.697 --> 33:05.499
The nature of his involvement isn't clear...

33:05.699 --> 33:09.202
...but he has escaped custody,
and is considered a fugitive.

33:09.402 --> 33:11.004
We therefore have two objectives:

33:11.204 --> 33:14.708
Find Jack Bauer, and make a quick
and accurate assessment...

33:14.908 --> 33:17.210
...of the threat, if any,
facing Senator Palmer.

33:18.712 --> 33:22.215
I know most of you have been
up more than 24 hours.

33:22.716 --> 33:24.217
Too bad.

33:24.718 --> 33:27.521
Nobody so much as yawns until
we accomplish our objective.

33:27.721 --> 33:31.725
If anyone has a problem with that,
now would be a good time to resign.

33:38.231 --> 33:40.734
Good. Let's get back to work.

33:41.234 --> 33:45.238
Specific assignments will be confirmed
or revised within the hour.

33:53.747 --> 33:57.250
Obviously this is awkward, but we'll
get through this. We're pros.

33:57.751 --> 33:58.752
Of course.

34:00.253 --> 34:01.755
We'll talk later.

34:16.770 --> 34:17.771
Hold on a minute.

34:19.773 --> 34:21.641
Is it true you played basketball?

34:21.841 --> 34:23.577
I sure did. Georgetown.

34:23.777 --> 34:26.864
My daddy says Georgetown sucks!

34:27.063 --> 34:29.583
I need to have a little talk
with your daddy.

34:29.783 --> 34:33.402
My daddy also says there will never be
a black president in this country.

34:33.786 --> 34:34.788
Ever.

34:36.790 --> 34:40.594
Would you give your daddy a message for me?

34:40.793 --> 34:45.297
You tell him I understand where he's
coming from, but he's wrong...

34:46.299 --> 34:47.300
...and I'm gonna prove it.

34:49.302 --> 34:51.304
- Tell him that, okay?
- Okay.

34:52.806 --> 34:54.608
I have Frank Ames on the phone.

34:54.808 --> 34:56.810
- What does he want?
- He wouldn't tell me.

34:57.310 --> 34:58.311
I'll call him back.

34:58.812 --> 35:00.313
He said it was urgent.

35:02.315 --> 35:05.435
He's your biggest contributor.
You can't just blow him off.

35:11.825 --> 35:15.829
I am very sorry. Would you
excuse me for a minute?

35:18.331 --> 35:20.834
Senator.

35:24.838 --> 35:27.090
Frank? This is kind of a bad time.

35:27.290 --> 35:29.542
Well, it's about to get worse.

35:29.742 --> 35:30.844
What do you mean?

35:31.344 --> 35:33.847
I just got out of a meeting with Carl,
Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen.

35:34.347 --> 35:35.148
A meeting about what?

35:35.348 --> 35:37.851
George Ferragamo, your son's therapist.

35:41.855 --> 35:45.358
I know the three of you have given a
lot of money to my campaign...

35:45.558 --> 35:47.861
...but that doesn't make my son's
therapist your business.

35:48.361 --> 35:50.664
It is when he's accusing your son of murder.

35:50.864 --> 35:54.868
He's a problem, and Tuttle and
Jorgensen don't like problems.

35:55.068 --> 35:58.121
They told Carl to get rid of it,
permanently.

35:58.321 --> 36:01.374
I've played hardball all my life,
but this...

36:01.457 --> 36:03.593
What are you trying to say?
They told Carl to...

36:03.793 --> 36:07.830
Listen, I am washing my hands of
this and your whole campaign.

36:08.030 --> 36:10.383
- Frank!
- I am out of it, David.

36:15.388 --> 36:16.890
What was that about?

36:19.893 --> 36:22.896
I need to talk to Carl, now.

36:50.189 --> 36:51.691
You wanted to see me?

36:56.195 --> 36:58.698
- Give us five minutes.
- Certainly.

37:01.701 --> 37:05.204
I don't know where Jack is. I haven't
talked to him since this morning.

37:05.371 --> 37:07.398
Since he escaped from
custody with a hostage?

37:07.598 --> 37:09.626
- That's right.
- I'm not sure I believe you.

37:13.212 --> 37:15.014
If you tell me where he is...

37:15.214 --> 37:18.217
...I'll do what I can to make sure
nothing heavy falls on you.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.219
I told you, I don't know.

37:23.222 --> 37:27.010
From what I've heard, there are very
few secrets between you and Jack.

37:27.210 --> 37:30.530
Jack doesn't trust anyone, including me.

37:30.730 --> 37:35.384
Getting involved with Jack was one of
the biggest mistakes I've ever made.

37:35.584 --> 37:40.239
Not that I'm judging you, Nina, but
there's a right way to do these things.

37:40.439 --> 37:43.543
Let them screw you,
don't let them screw you over.

37:43.743 --> 37:47.747
If you don't have any more pearls of
wisdom, I'd like to get back to work.

37:47.947 --> 37:49.248
By all means.

37:53.753 --> 37:55.054
Cofell Enterprises.

37:55.254 --> 37:57.757
Hey, it's Ted's friend from
business school again.

37:57.957 --> 37:59.258
I'm sorry, but I'm in the building.

37:59.759 --> 38:01.761
I was hoping I could come up
and say a quick hello.

38:01.961 --> 38:03.763
Is Ted gonna be there
for a few more minutes?

38:03.963 --> 38:06.515
I'm sorry, sir, he's on his way out.

38:06.715 --> 38:09.268
What floor is Cofell Enterprises on?

38:09.468 --> 38:10.519
Fourteenth.

38:10.719 --> 38:11.771
Thank you.

38:19.779 --> 38:22.582
- Could you call my car please?
- Okay.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.284
I should head to the airport
a little early today.

38:25.484 --> 38:27.587
The radio said the traffic
was a little slow.

38:27.787 --> 38:32.291
Mr. Cofell, a friend of yours from
business school is on the way to see you.

38:33.292 --> 38:36.796
- On his way up now?
- I tried to stop him.

38:36.996 --> 38:38.097
He say who it was?

38:38.297 --> 38:41.300
He didn't give his name. He's
probably trying to sell you something.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.303
- Don't give him my cell number.
- Have a good trip.

38:44.503 --> 38:47.106
- Don't forget your phone.
- Great.

38:47.306 --> 38:51.310
I just wanted to let you know that
Mr. Cofell is on his way down.

38:51.510 --> 38:53.613
Excuse me, where's Mr. Cofell?

38:53.813 --> 38:56.315
I'm so sorry, he just stepped
into the elevator.

38:59.068 --> 39:00.937
Where was he going?
Down to the parking garage?

39:01.320 --> 39:02.822
It's all right. Never mind.

39:16.335 --> 39:18.137
There's nothing to worry about.

39:18.337 --> 39:21.340
There's a 30-second reset, then we'll
continue down automatically.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.843
It's probably a false alarm anyhow.

40:08.387 --> 40:11.891
- Excuse me, are you Mr. Cofell's driver?
- Yeah, that's right.

40:12.091 --> 40:13.693
I'm a Federal Agent.

40:13.893 --> 40:16.896
- Where are you going today?
- To the airport.

40:17.096 --> 40:18.698
On what business?

40:18.898 --> 40:20.700
Look, I'm just his driver.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.903
- Is there a problem here?
- Come with me a second.

40:38.417 --> 40:41.420
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day, Mr. Cofell.

40:43.923 --> 40:45.424
Valet.

40:55.434 --> 40:57.937
Mark, could you turn the air
on back here, please?

41:22.461 --> 41:23.763
Then they began to laugh.

41:23.963 --> 41:27.466
They began to say things like,
'You remember him, don't you?'

41:27.666 --> 41:30.469
Doesn't he live with you?
Yeah, sure he does.'"

41:39.979 --> 41:40.780
Are you okay?

41:40.980 --> 41:42.982
Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing.

41:43.482 --> 41:46.485
- He hurt you, didn't he?
- No, honey. I'm fine.
