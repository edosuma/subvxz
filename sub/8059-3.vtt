WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.336
So, gentlemen, you have evidence

00:04.371 --> 00:05.971
that the Newport land
should be preserved.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.506
Absolutely.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.708
You see, I'm a ninth level
Octopriest

00:09.742 --> 00:11.577
in the Church
of the Reasonableists.

00:11.611 --> 00:12.544
Oh, boy.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.314
The land is sacred
in our religion.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.350
Because it's the place where all
human souls will be transmuted

00:18.385 --> 00:20.285
when Zorpe the Lizard God
passes through

00:20.320 --> 00:22.154
Jupiter's sphincter.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.256
- Hail, Zorpe.
Both: Hail, Zorpe!

00:24.290 --> 00:26.825
I'm looking for anything
to strengthen my case

00:26.860 --> 00:28.961
that the Newport land should
become a park,

00:28.995 --> 00:30.429
and not a corpate campus.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.764
Religious reasons,
animal conservation,

00:32.799 --> 00:33.932
historical significance.

00:33.967 --> 00:34.967
Anything.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.236
So hold on to your straws,
everybody.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.638
'cause Mama's going graspin'.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.875
In 1980, there were more
than 600 million

00:42.909 --> 00:45.944
Indiana brown ants
in that forest.

00:45.979 --> 00:50.182
Today, there are only
595 million.

00:50.216 --> 00:54.186
At that rate, they'll all be
gone by the year 2030.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.322
- 60.
- 200 and 3,060?

00:57.357 --> 00:59.691
- 200,000 years from now?
- Yes.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.760
That doesn't seem like
an immediate crisis.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.762
I got a different idea
for that land.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.498
An amusement park
with rides and food

01:06.533 --> 01:08.367
and sexy cartoon characters.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.770
- I call it Disneyland.
- How did you get in here?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.672
Broke a window.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.675

01:34.888 --> 01:36.374
Oh, hey, guys.
Come on in.

01:36.608 --> 01:38.642
You guys, I am Roscoe.

01:38.677 --> 01:41.164
I am Vice President of
Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.

01:41.488 --> 01:43.726
Feel free in this meeting
to break out your vapes

01:43.854 --> 01:45.020
and just kick back.

01:45.055 --> 01:46.288
Now, peep this.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.224
Leslie Knope has been meeting
with people

01:48.258 --> 01:50.292
to try to sexy-up
her presentation.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.294
So we had this far-out
brain tornado.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.662
Good idea.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.665
We should get a brity to come
kick it with us small time,

01:56.700 --> 01:58.400
and then just be like,
"Hey, chumps.

01:58.435 --> 01:59.401
Let's get tight with Gryzz."

01:59.436 --> 02:00.836
We need a celebrity.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.872
As a minority owner,
it'll strengthen Gryzzl's bid.

02:02.906 --> 02:07.276
Is a celebrity necessary?
I prefer quality over flash.

02:07.310 --> 02:10.079
That's why I refuse to write
my signature in cursive.

02:10.113 --> 02:12.248
Celebrities can help
with this kind of thing.

02:12.282 --> 02:14.483
The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn
if it weren't for Jay-Z.

02:14.517 --> 02:16.852
And the sales for Chick-fil-A
went through the roof

02:16.887 --> 02:17.887
once Elton John bought 'em.

02:17.921 --> 02:18.921
Exactly.

02:18.955 --> 02:20.623
Gryzzl is an outsider here
in Pawnee,

02:20.657 --> 02:22.625
so a local celebrity
is gonna make everyone

02:22.659 --> 02:24.293
feel more at ease with us.

02:24.327 --> 02:26.529
And that's why we called on you
home court chillers

02:26.563 --> 02:27.863
to frack your braniums.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.466
Since we're locals, they want
us to think of ideas.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.701
- I got it in context.
- Okay.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.238
I have no interest
in consorting with celebrities.

02:36.273 --> 02:38.908
The only celebrities I recognize
are furniture maker

02:38.942 --> 02:41.610
Garry Knox Bennett,
designer of the notorious

02:41.645 --> 02:44.813
16 Penny Nail Cabinet,
and Magnus,

02:44.848 --> 02:48.350
the five-by-five bull elk I saw
near my cabin two years ago.

02:48.385 --> 02:51.520
Took a shot at the bastard
and he stuck his antlers

02:51.555 --> 02:53.422
through the door
of my meat shed.

02:53.457 --> 02:57.259
One day, Magnus.
I will wear you as a jacket.

02:57.294 --> 03:01.130
Have you thought about this.
You could be an airline pilot.

03:01.164 --> 03:04.500
- I don't like heights.
- What about a submarine pilot?

03:04.534 --> 03:06.769
- I don't like depths.
- Mm.

03:06.803 --> 03:08.237
I don't like anything, okay.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.505
You're not gonna be able
to find a career for me,

03:09.539 --> 03:10.472
so just give up.

03:10.507 --> 03:12.341
No way, babe.
We can do this.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.742
Let's play a game.
Okay?

03:13.777 --> 03:16.445
You say a word, I say a word.
We see if it makes a profession.

03:16.479 --> 03:18.848
- Executive.
- Trampoline.

03:18.882 --> 03:21.450
- Computer.
- Trampoline.

03:21.485 --> 03:23.686
- Trampoline.
- Pass.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.054
Hey, Leslie?

03:25.088 --> 03:28.190
I need both you and Ron to sign
this city point of sale document

03:28.225 --> 03:30.926
since the land you're gunning
for lies within city limits.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.928
Can we run over to Ron's office
and take care of this?

03:32.963 --> 03:35.231
Well, I love it when you talk
point of sale doc,

03:35.265 --> 03:37.266
'cause you know it turns me on,
but, no, no.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.035
There's no way that I will be in
the same room with Ron Swanson,

03:40.070 --> 03:42.972
unless it is during a police
lineup when I am pointing

03:43.006 --> 03:44.573
him out as the man
who betrayed me.

03:44.608 --> 03:46.509
That's him, officer.
Ronald Swanson.

03:46.543 --> 03:47.910
[deep voice] Thank you, Leslie.

03:47.944 --> 03:49.345
That's the fifth crime you've
solved this month.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.113
I'm not supposed to do this,
but let me give you a badge

03:51.148 --> 03:52.381
and a siren for your car.

03:52.415 --> 03:54.450
Could you please focus?
It'll take two minutes.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.019
And all signatures need to be
notarized, and I really don't

03:57.053 --> 04:00.056
want to have to schedule two
different notary appointments.

04:00.090 --> 04:03.993
Uh, not to eavesdrop,
but I have a crazy story.

04:04.027 --> 04:05.795
I recently had a bit
of a health scare,

04:05.829 --> 04:07.062
just a couple weeks
in the hospital.

04:07.097 --> 04:09.832
Oh, God.
This story's terrible so far.

04:09.866 --> 04:11.967
Anyway, I became really
motivated once I got out

04:12.002 --> 04:14.837
to finally live life
to the fullest.

04:14.871 --> 04:18.607
So...I fulfilled one of
my lifelong dreams.

04:18.642 --> 04:20.843
And I became a notary public.

04:20.877 --> 04:22.711
So if I go with you,
Ron and Leslie

04:22.746 --> 04:23.979
can sign the document
separately.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.915
Yeah, see?
Ben, it all works out.

04:25.949 --> 04:29.151
I'll sign the documents here
and then you can bring it to Ron

04:29.186 --> 04:31.020
and he can sign it there,
and then you can tell Ron

04:31.054 --> 04:32.288
to rot in hell.

04:32.322 --> 04:34.356
How long are you two gonna
go on like this?

04:34.391 --> 04:35.825
You're acting like a little kid.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.493
No, I'm not.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.728
And infinity plus one year.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.864
Andy?
Bring me the next person.

04:41.898 --> 04:45.968
Perd Hapley.
Crazy Ira and the Douche.

04:46.002 --> 04:47.536
Tom Haverford?

04:47.571 --> 04:49.004
That's nice, but I don't know
if you can really consider me

04:49.039 --> 04:50.172
a celebrity.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.607
Yeah, that's your handwriting.

04:51.641 --> 04:53.309
These are all great options,
but I think we need

04:53.343 --> 04:56.545
to go after Pawnee's
biggest fish--

04:56.580 --> 04:57.813
Annabel Porter from Bloosh.

04:57.848 --> 04:59.281
That horrifying
lifestyle newsletter

04:59.316 --> 05:02.451
filled with vegan recipes
and pointless tchotchkes?

05:02.486 --> 05:04.787
Forget it.
That woman is my nightmare.

05:04.821 --> 05:07.690
Um, she's a big deal, Ron.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.860
Bloosh just won the Pulitzer
Prize for Best Top Ten Listicle

05:10.894 --> 05:12.695
two years in a row.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.130
Hi, Leslie.

05:14.164 --> 05:16.899
Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee
Historical Society.

05:16.933 --> 05:19.101
Oh, yes, Bill.
I remember you.

05:19.136 --> 05:20.936
I heard you were looking
for information

05:20.971 --> 05:24.406
on the Newport land, and I have
some very exciting news for you.

05:24.441 --> 05:27.810
It concerns William Henry
Harrison.

05:27.844 --> 05:30.079
We claim William Henry
Harrison as a hero

05:30.113 --> 05:31.280
because he was
the first governor

05:31.314 --> 05:32.515
of the Indiana territories,

05:32.549 --> 05:34.717
and then President
of the United States.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.252
We're also a little ashamed
of him

05:36.286 --> 05:38.921
because he didn't wear a coat
at his inauguration,

05:38.955 --> 05:42.057
caught a bad cold
and died 32 days later.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.759
He's an embarrassing footnote.

05:43.793 --> 05:46.295
But he's our embarrassing
footnote.

05:46.329 --> 05:49.231
I've recently self-Published
a biography about Harrison

05:49.266 --> 05:52.201
entitled,<i> Barely A President.</i>

05:52.235 --> 05:55.704
<i>William Henry Harrison's</i>
<i>32 Days In The White House."</i>

05:55.739 --> 05:57.573
I discovered that Harrison had

05:57.607 --> 06:00.076
a heretofore
unknown hunting lodge

06:00.110 --> 06:02.778
on the very land you're trying
to acquire.

06:02.813 --> 06:06.015
Um, spoilers much?
Now I'll never read that book.

06:06.049 --> 06:08.484
If a U.S. President had
a house on that land,

06:08.518 --> 06:10.619
it could qualify for historic
landmark status,

06:10.654 --> 06:12.655
and we could really stick it
to Ron's team.

06:12.689 --> 06:13.889
Which would be icing
on the cake,

06:13.924 --> 06:15.491
not the reason
why we're doing this.

06:15.525 --> 06:17.393
Okay.
Show me this incredible lodge.

06:17.427 --> 06:18.627
Let's go.

06:18.662 --> 06:20.696
That book sounded so boring,
I cried a little.

06:20.731 --> 06:23.299
Oh, babe.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.633
You're safe now.

06:24.668 --> 06:25.768
Hey, Ron.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.203
Sorry to bother you,
but I need you to sign

06:27.237 --> 06:29.371
this point of sale document.

06:29.406 --> 06:31.807
And please sign it in cursive.

06:31.842 --> 06:33.409
It raises a lot of red flags
if you--

06:33.443 --> 06:36.045
- No.
- Okay.

06:36.079 --> 06:38.447
So...
what's Leslie up to?

06:38.482 --> 06:40.149
Well, I don't think I should
discuss that,

06:40.183 --> 06:41.817
given that you're in
competition.

06:41.852 --> 06:44.587
- Need to remain neutral.
- Fair enough.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.288
Terry, what's Leslie up to?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.691
She is trying to find
a historical to earmark

06:48.725 --> 06:49.692
the land for preservation.

06:49.726 --> 06:51.227
Terry, come on, man.

06:51.261 --> 06:54.063
Leslie, you little sneak.

06:54.097 --> 06:56.365
If Leslie's going for a hook,
we should too.

06:56.399 --> 07:00.002
Let's get Annabel Bloosh Person.
Yes!

07:00.037 --> 07:01.537
Glad to see you
finally come around

07:01.571 --> 07:02.805
after these two minutes
of insanity.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.007
Now will you please consider
investing

07:05.041 --> 07:07.309
in that toddler cologne
I've been bugging you about.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.477
Toddler cologne.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.880
Baby--tsst tsst--
you smell good.

07:13.049 --> 07:14.917
Here we are.

07:14.951 --> 07:18.287
Here we are, like, "Here's
the place where I buried the map

07:18.321 --> 07:20.289
that will show us the way
to William Henry Harrison's

07:20.323 --> 07:21.690
awesome hunting cabin?"

07:21.725 --> 07:25.161
- No, this is all that's left.
- This place is awesome.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.496
Hey, we should sell our dumb
house and buy this one.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.266
Okay, you know, I love William
Henry Harrison as much,

07:30.300 --> 07:34.069
if not slightly more than the
next guy, but this is garbage.

07:34.104 --> 07:36.739
I mean, literally, there's a bag
of old hamburgers over there.

07:36.773 --> 07:39.575
What?
Ohh.

07:39.609 --> 07:41.977
We're running out of time
and we need to beat Ron.

07:42.012 --> 07:45.915
So...we're gonna have to use
this old pile of bricks.

07:45.949 --> 07:48.984
I need to gather everything
I can on William Henry Harrison.

07:49.019 --> 07:51.987
Let's head to the Harrison
Museum over in Vincennes.

07:52.022 --> 07:53.656
I volunteer there part time.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.692
I just found an artifact!
Historical artifact.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.061
William Henry Harrison's wig.

07:59.095 --> 08:03.090
- Andy, put that down.
- Cool.

08:05.082 --> 08:06.282
You've got to be kidding me.

08:06.338 --> 08:08.466
No, I'm sorry, but there's
a page missing from the document

08:08.479 --> 08:10.881
so then the signatures
are invalid.

08:10.915 --> 08:12.849
Can't we just say it was there?

08:12.884 --> 08:15.085
You're asking a notary to lie.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.653
I signed an oath, Ben.

08:16.688 --> 08:19.956
And then a different notary
notarized the oath I signed.

08:20.961 --> 08:23.527
William Henry Harrison
is totally ridiculous.

08:23.561 --> 08:25.696
They can't even fill a small
museum with real stuff

08:25.730 --> 08:27.597
about his life because
he was so lame.

08:27.632 --> 08:31.168
The "If He'd Worn A Coat Room"
explores how great America

08:31.202 --> 08:35.105
would have been if Harrison had
worn a coat at his inauguration.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.673
And not died.

08:36.707 --> 08:38.174
<i>[Tubthumping</i> playing]
This room is called

08:38.208 --> 08:40.811
"Other Things That Were
Famous for One Month."

08:40.845 --> 08:45.882
Oh, and side note, admission
to this museum costs $14.

08:45.917 --> 08:48.718
And while you're here,
why not visit

08:48.753 --> 08:51.755
the "Other Famous Harrisons"
exhibit.

08:51.789 --> 08:54.725
Okay, guys, this is so great.

08:54.759 --> 08:57.661
During the election campaign
of 1840, William Henry Harrison

08:57.695 --> 09:02.332
supporters rolled this ten foot
tin and paper ball

09:02.367 --> 09:05.068
down country lanes all across
America.

09:05.103 --> 09:07.104
And--And they would sing along
with a jug band,

09:07.138 --> 09:08.605
and it was just so exciting.

09:08.639 --> 09:10.173
People would come for miles
just to see it.

09:10.208 --> 09:13.176
Why, was there something
inside this stupid ball?

09:13.211 --> 09:14.811
Ooh, like a giant hamster?

09:14.846 --> 09:17.414
This is what we have
to work with, okay.

09:17.448 --> 09:19.850
We are up against a very flashy
internet company,

09:19.884 --> 09:22.719
and we should be aiming
for quantity over quality.

09:22.754 --> 09:25.522
So we're gonna throw a bunch
of Harrison facts at them

09:25.556 --> 09:28.525
and a big pile of bricks
and whatever else we can find.

09:28.559 --> 09:31.028
Quantity, people.
Quantity!

09:31.062 --> 09:33.296
Wow.

09:33.331 --> 09:36.199
This is exactly what I imagine
Heaven looks like.

09:36.234 --> 09:39.136
Right down to the unisex
linen tunics.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.904
- Annabel,<i> ma cherie.</i>
- Hi.

09:40.938 --> 09:42.839
I'm sorry I'm late
for our coven.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.043
I was polishing my oyster forks
with a cage-free olive oil rub.

09:46.077 --> 09:47.677
Apology accepted, and then

09:47.712 --> 09:50.647
I have no reaction
to anything else you said.

09:50.681 --> 09:53.583
I can't help but ask,
what's in right now?

09:53.618 --> 09:55.786
Well, this season I'm intrigued

09:55.820 --> 09:59.156
by...asymmetrical overalls,

09:59.190 --> 10:02.426
angora toothbrushes,
and locally sourced

10:02.460 --> 10:03.760
Italian flip flops.

10:03.795 --> 10:07.130
Also, there's a flirty trend
in beverages.

10:07.165 --> 10:09.299
So you've had soy milk
and almond milk.

10:09.334 --> 10:14.938
Now try the hottest
new craze...beef milk.

10:14.972 --> 10:19.376
It's like almond milk that's
been squeezed through tiny holes

10:19.410 --> 10:22.679
in living cows.

10:22.714 --> 10:24.114
It's fucking milk.

10:24.148 --> 10:26.616
- No.
- No.

10:26.651 --> 10:28.118
Milk cost $3 a gallon.

10:28.152 --> 10:29.473
Annabel's authentic,
hand-strained

10:29.487 --> 10:31.121
teat-to-table beef milk,

10:31.155 --> 10:33.490
that costs $60 a gallon.

10:33.524 --> 10:36.026
Yeah, and there's a wait list.

10:36.060 --> 10:38.428
This woman knows business.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.731
And I'd be extremely jazzed
to be a part of the Gryzzl bid.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.735
Shall we discuss it in my yurt?
Great.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.739
Ron?
Okay, let's try this again.

10:48.773 --> 10:53.510
All pages accounted for,
just sign right here.

10:53.544 --> 10:55.645
How is Leslie doing
with her quest?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.315
Again, I don't want to talk
about her plan with you,

10:58.349 --> 10:59.850
nor yours with her.

10:59.884 --> 11:02.018
- Sure you understand.
- Absolutely.

11:02.053 --> 11:03.787
Terry, what is Leslie up to?

11:03.821 --> 11:05.288
Oh, getting ready for a big
press conference.

11:05.323 --> 11:06.990
Terry, come on.

11:07.024 --> 11:08.258
A press conference.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.395
So she's found something
to strengthen her bid.

11:11.429 --> 11:15.132
Ms. Porter,
no need to discuss any further.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.301
You will be the face
of the Gryzzl bid.

11:17.335 --> 11:18.602
Smashing.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.872
Well, this calls for a
celebratory dram of aged grappa.

11:21.906 --> 11:23.240
- Okay, so I just sign here?
- No.

11:23.274 --> 11:25.142
No, no!
Aw.

11:25.176 --> 11:28.045
Great.
There you go.

11:28.079 --> 11:30.814
- Yeah, that's invalid now.
- Yeah, I know.

11:30.848 --> 11:32.783
Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.385
I just wanted to say that
I really like your museum.

11:35.420 --> 11:40.390
It's weird and sad
and unnecessary.

11:40.425 --> 11:45.962
Is there, like, a museum curator
position I could apply for?

11:45.997 --> 11:49.066
Sorry, everyone here
is a volunteer.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.101
Though you do get
a yearly stipend

11:51.135 --> 11:54.171
of 50,000 Harrison Bucks.

11:54.205 --> 11:58.075
Accepted only
at that vending machine.

11:58.109 --> 12:00.944
- Thanks.
- That's a bummer.

12:00.978 --> 12:02.312
But, hey, hey, listen.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.415
Maybe you could start
your own museum.

12:05.450 --> 12:06.750
About what?

12:06.784 --> 12:09.519
I'm sorry,
but I am not like you.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.687
You love everything.

12:10.722 --> 12:14.625
The only things I like are dogs,
sleeping late,

12:14.659 --> 12:16.426
and weird birthmarks.

12:16.461 --> 12:18.462
You can't make museums
about those.

12:18.496 --> 12:20.263
- This is another dead end.
- Guys?

12:20.298 --> 12:21.498
Let's keep it going, right?

12:21.532 --> 12:22.899
Somebody grab
the reading glasses,

12:22.934 --> 12:24.214
somebody grab
that walking stick.

12:24.235 --> 12:25.869
Grab everything you can.

12:25.903 --> 12:29.072
I'm officially dubbing this
Operation Quantity.

12:29.107 --> 12:30.540
Oh, thank God you're still here.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.610
I cannot believe the weird
notary hell

12:33.645 --> 12:34.878
I've been trapped in.

12:34.912 --> 12:36.947
Been more like heaven for me.
I mean, what a day.

12:36.981 --> 12:39.182
- What's Ron up to?
- Okay, I am not--

12:39.217 --> 12:40.817
- No, no, you have to tell me
because you legally vow yourself

12:40.852 --> 12:41.818
to me in marriage.

12:41.853 --> 12:43.453
- Sucker.
- Okay, fine.

to be the celebrity face

12:45.523 --> 12:46.490

12:46.524 --> 12:47.724
Little rat.

12:47.759 --> 12:49.393
Okay.
Two can play this game.

12:49.427 --> 12:52.562
Bill?
Operation Quantity needs a face.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.197
Does William Henry Harrison
have any direct descendants

12:54.232 --> 12:55.432
in the area?

12:55.466 --> 12:59.736
One--a distant nephew named
Zack Harrison.

12:59.771 --> 13:02.406
This is our guy.
American royalty.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.876
His veins pulse with the blood
of our storied forefather.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.211
Zack Harrison?
I went to camp with this guy.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.313
Ha ha!

13:09.347 --> 13:10.847
No one would ride
in the boat with him

13:10.882 --> 13:12.482
'cause he had terrible B.O.,
and then he went with Janine,

13:12.517 --> 13:14.418
our counselor, and he fell
asleep and got a boner.

13:14.452 --> 13:16.453
Well, he's
American royalty, okay?

13:16.487 --> 13:17.788
And we need him for the press
conference, and we need

13:17.822 --> 13:19.823
all of this stuff.

13:19.857 --> 13:23.760
So help me God, I will make a
mountain out of this mole hill.

13:24.486 --> 13:28.053
- Leslie, I do--
- Quantity, people.

13:31.112 --> 13:33.480
Notary public's can trace
our origin all the way back

13:33.514 --> 13:34.781
to ancient Rome.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.583
- No way.
- Calvin Coolidge was a notary.

13:36.617 --> 13:37.917
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.952 --> 13:39.552
And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad

13:39.587 --> 13:41.921
and so was Calvin Coolidge's
paternal grandfather.

13:41.956 --> 13:43.123
Uh-huh.

13:43.157 --> 13:45.525
It's 2.5 pounds of pressure
is what you need

13:45.559 --> 13:47.160

13:47.194 --> 13:48.879

13:48.999 --> 13:50.766
Well, it's a notary
email newsletter

13:50.800 --> 13:51.734
and, oh, my gosh--

13:51.768 --> 13:53.135
- All right.
- Ben, it's fun.

13:53.169 --> 13:54.637
It's just fun.

13:54.671 --> 13:55.832
Babe?

13:55.902 --> 13:57.743
I have been thinking a lot about
what you said.

13:57.864 --> 14:00.899
I made a list of everything
that I know you like.

staring contests,

14:02.902 --> 14:04.769

14:04.804 --> 14:07.405
And then, I lost the list.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.040
So I had to make a new list.

14:09.075 --> 14:10.876
I didn't have any paper,
so I wrote it on my leg.

14:10.910 --> 14:13.345
And that's when my leg fell
asleep--

14:13.379 --> 14:15.347
- Okay, could you just skip
ahead a little?

14:15.381 --> 14:17.782
What do all the things on
that list have in common?

14:17.817 --> 14:19.885
They're one-on-one.

14:19.919 --> 14:24.589
You like dealing with people,
or dogs, one-on-one.

14:24.624 --> 14:27.392
See, we don't make a list
of the things that you love,

14:27.426 --> 14:30.028
we make a list of the reasons
why you love them.

14:30.062 --> 14:33.031
And then we find something
that fits that list.

14:33.065 --> 14:35.233
You're the best husband ever.

14:39.138 --> 14:40.338
Hi, Zack Harrison.

14:40.373 --> 14:42.040
You wanted to meet with me about
a press conference?

14:42.074 --> 14:43.275
Oh, yes.
Hello, Zack.

14:43.309 --> 14:45.544
Yes, I am Leslie.
It is an honor to have you here.

14:45.578 --> 14:48.980
You are Indiana's last living
link to this great man.

14:49.015 --> 14:50.181
Look, I really don't think

14:50.216 --> 14:52.083
you should make a big deal
out of this.

14:52.118 --> 14:54.252
I just happen to be
a descendant of a guy.

14:54.287 --> 14:56.021
You could be the descendant
of George Washington.

14:56.055 --> 14:57.556
- I wouldn't know.
- Do you--

14:57.590 --> 14:58.757
- No, that was just
a hypothetical.

14:58.791 --> 14:59.891
Could that be possible?

14:59.926 --> 15:00.992
Because, you know,
I have always thought

15:01.027 --> 15:03.728
that we shared very similar
jaw lines.

15:03.763 --> 15:05.397
Wow.
That is something to chew on.

15:05.431 --> 15:06.932
Anyway, okay.
It doesn't matter.

15:06.966 --> 15:08.633
I need this to be
very impressive.

15:08.668 --> 15:12.804

Okay?

15:14.106 --> 15:15.173

- I don't--

anything about ambushing

15:42.201 --> 15:43.501

16:10.997 --> 16:13.698
What great historical moments

16:13.733 --> 16:16.067
took place within
these hallowed halls?

16:16.102 --> 16:19.237
Did Harrison plan his
presidential campaign

16:19.272 --> 16:20.939
while sitting around the hearth?

16:20.973 --> 16:22.707
Which used to be there.

16:22.742 --> 16:24.543
Did he write letters
to Thomas Jefferson

16:24.577 --> 16:25.911
on his roll top desk?

16:25.945 --> 16:27.979
Which, you know, I don't know,
might have existed.

16:28.014 --> 16:30.615

William Henry Harrison

preserved as a national park.

35:00.942 --> 35:02.076
"as a gesture of goodwill.

35:02.110 --> 35:03.944
Leslie Knope."

35:03.979 --> 35:06.513
That was the real reason
I hired you.

35:06.548 --> 35:08.916
Those brownies were damn good.

35:08.950 --> 35:11.251
Ron, look how far we've come.

35:11.286 --> 35:12.953
We're doing so great.

35:12.988 --> 35:14.388
Let's just bring it home, okay?

35:14.422 --> 35:15.756
Let's just talk about
our issues.

35:15.790 --> 35:17.291
- Leslie, don't push it.
- Okay, fine.

35:17.325 --> 35:20.194
If I guess and guess right,
you have to tell me.

35:20.228 --> 35:22.096
Ready?
[snaps]

35:22.130 --> 35:25.432
Two years ago, you found out
you were 1/4 French,

35:25.467 --> 35:26.834
and you had a nervous breakdown.

35:26.868 --> 35:29.837
Okay, playtime is over.

35:29.871 --> 35:31.972
I'm getting out of here
once and for all.

35:32.006 --> 35:33.073
No, Ron! God, no!

35:35.443 --> 35:38.045
That alarm is just
for sprinklers.

35:38.079 --> 35:39.146
April kept pulling it,

35:39.180 --> 35:41.348
so the fire department
disconnected it.

35:41.383 --> 35:42.583
I see.

35:49.094 --> 35:51.695
Ron? I found some towels.

35:51.730 --> 35:54.531
You okay?

35:54.566 --> 35:56.365
[laughs] Wow.

35:56.485 --> 35:58.884
Apparently,
Craig is studying yoga.

35:59.238 --> 36:01.239
These are the only
dry clothes I could find.

36:01.274 --> 36:02.975
Well, you look great.

36:03.009 --> 36:04.176
I feel extremely angry.

36:04.210 --> 36:05.644
Oh, come on.

36:05.678 --> 36:07.145
Stop whining, you big baby.

36:07.180 --> 36:09.214
I've seen you
with your eyebrows blown off.

36:09.248 --> 36:10.882
I've seen you
without a mustache.

36:10.917 --> 36:11.950
I've seen it all.

36:11.985 --> 36:13.251
There's nowhere to run, Ron.

36:13.286 --> 36:15.854
You have tried every possible
means of escape.

36:15.888 --> 36:18.290
There's nothing to do but talk.

36:18.324 --> 36:19.458
What happened

36:19.492 --> 36:23.128
to these "workplace proximity
associates"?

36:23.162 --> 36:24.296
Hmm?

36:24.330 --> 36:26.932
Spill it.

36:26.966 --> 36:29.501
You left.

36:29.535 --> 36:32.170
Then a month later,
you took Terry with you.

36:32.205 --> 36:33.972
Yeah, well, we needed
a mindless factotum,

36:34.006 --> 36:35.674
and he's the best there is.

36:35.708 --> 36:38.110
Amen.

36:38.144 --> 36:40.546
Then you took April.

36:40.580 --> 36:43.181
I didn't want her to go,
as she had become

36:43.216 --> 36:46.551
one of my closest
workplace acquaintances.

36:46.586 --> 36:48.387
But your offer was too good
to pass up,

36:48.421 --> 36:50.322
so I didn't try to stop her.

36:50.356 --> 36:52.824
Then Tom left
to run his business.

36:52.859 --> 36:54.693
Donna left to run hers.

36:54.727 --> 36:56.695
One day, I looked up.

36:56.729 --> 36:58.997
Just didn't recognize anyone.

36:59.032 --> 37:01.900
So I made a decision.

37:01.934 --> 37:04.136
An unthinkable decision.

37:05.805 --> 37:06.738
Hey.

37:06.773 --> 37:08.206
Well, my, my, my.

37:08.241 --> 37:09.241
Do my eyes deceive me?

37:09.275 --> 37:10.909
Is that Ron Swanson?

37:10.943 --> 37:12.711
Hello, Leslie.

37:12.745 --> 37:13.946
Hello, April. Larry.

37:13.980 --> 37:14.947
It's Terry now.

37:14.981 --> 37:16.214
Okay.

37:16.249 --> 37:17.749
- As luck would have it--
- One second. Oh.

37:17.784 --> 37:19.317
Did you talk to Randy
about the vote?

37:19.352 --> 37:21.453
Tell the Northeast that
we need to put pressure on them,

37:21.487 --> 37:22.788
or else we're gonna be waiting
forever,

37:22.822 --> 37:24.089
and I'm tired of waiting
on them, okay?

37:24.123 --> 37:25.490
Sorry.
This is a crazy day.

37:25.525 --> 37:26.886
So what's up with you,
you big lug?

37:26.893 --> 37:28.026
Nothing important.

37:28.061 --> 37:30.362
Just thought you might want
to have lunch.

37:30.396 --> 37:31.797
- Tomorrow?
- I would love to.

37:31.831 --> 37:34.766
It's been too long.
JJ's Diner, 12:30?

37:34.801 --> 37:36.735
- Excellent. See you then.
- Okay.

37:36.769 --> 37:39.204
So Randy says
the House is voting tomorrow,

37:39.238 --> 37:41.039
and they need us in Washington
to prep.

37:41.074 --> 37:42.174
Oh, my God, really?

37:42.208 --> 37:43.742
Okay, get us the first flight
out of here

37:43.776 --> 37:44.810
and grab the Missouri files.

37:44.844 --> 37:46.745
Meet me at my car.

37:46.779 --> 37:49.214
Hey, babe.
I got to go to Washington.

37:49.248 --> 37:51.083
Can you pick up the kids?

37:51.117 --> 37:52.884
Oh. Oh, no.

37:52.919 --> 37:55.120
Ron, I stood you up for lunch.

37:55.154 --> 37:56.788
You did, yes.

37:56.823 --> 37:58.757
I waited for a while,
but it was pretty easy

37:58.791 --> 38:00.225
to figure out what had happened.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.594
Your life seemed pretty hectic.

38:02.629 --> 38:04.596
Is that the rest of the story?

38:04.631 --> 38:06.898
That I stood you up?

38:08.768 --> 38:10.736
You were going to ask me
something.

38:10.770 --> 38:12.704
That's why you wanted
to have lunch.

38:14.841 --> 38:15.841
Ron, you were going--

38:15.875 --> 38:19.678
- I was gonna ask you for a job.

38:19.712 --> 38:21.980
In the federal government.

38:22.015 --> 38:24.449
Just saying it out loud
feels dirty.

38:26.486 --> 38:28.587
You missed your friends,

38:28.621 --> 38:30.555
and you wanted to come up
to the third floor

38:30.590 --> 38:32.057
and work with us again.

38:32.091 --> 38:33.525
[sighs]

38:33.559 --> 38:36.128
I can't even imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

38:36.162 --> 38:38.096
God, why didn't I see that?

38:38.131 --> 38:41.033
Ron, I am so sorry.

38:41.067 --> 38:43.268
I should've been
a better friend to you.

38:43.303 --> 38:46.038
Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.

38:46.072 --> 38:48.774
It was a punctuation mark
on a sentence

38:48.808 --> 38:50.008
that had already been written.

38:50.009 --> 38:52.277
My time in
government work was over.

38:52.312 --> 38:53.912
Sure, I loved
shutting things down

38:53.947 --> 38:56.748
and bleeding the rotting beast
from the inside.

38:56.783 --> 38:59.051
Your metaphors are so beautiful.

38:59.085 --> 39:00.419
But it was time for me to leave,

39:00.453 --> 39:02.554
and I didn't feel like
explaining why

39:02.589 --> 39:04.089
to you or anyone.

39:04.123 --> 39:05.891

after--

39:05.925 --> 39:07.125

the nurse's old house--

39:14.968 --> 39:18.070
I do regret that.

39:18.104 --> 39:20.939
I had a good run here.

39:20.974 --> 39:25.911
But after you and Tom and Donna
and April and Terry left,

39:25.945 --> 39:28.146
when I looked around
this office,

39:28.181 --> 39:30.382
nothing was the same.

39:30.416 --> 39:32.851
Yeah, well,
there's a way to fix that.
