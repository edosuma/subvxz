00:30.042 --> 00:32.441
<i>The amazing story I'm
about to tell you...</i>

00:32.442 --> 00:35.566
<i>took place in the deepest and
darkest parts of Africa.</i>

00:36.163 --> 00:40.607
<i>It is the tale of a young boy from
New York who lost everything...</i>

00:40.643 --> 00:42.891
<i>to become the King of the Jungle.</i>

00:51.284 --> 00:53.168
<i>But let's start at the beginning.</i>

00:53.444 --> 00:56.807
<i>To be precise, 70 million
years earlier...</i>

00:57.204 --> 01:00.487
<i>when the great dinosaurs
ruled the Earth.</i>

01:36.527 --> 01:40.573
<i>An American named Greystoke set up
camp at the edge of the jungle.</i>

01:40.927 --> 01:43.209
<i>He spent weeks in
search of the meteor,</i>

01:43.247 --> 01:45.326
<i>while his family enjoyed
the wilderness.</i>

01:45.327 --> 01:47.849
See, Kagira?
I told you he'd be back.

01:50.888 --> 01:52.055
<i>J.J.</i>

01:52.368 --> 01:54.138
J.J., where are you?

01:57.168 --> 01:58.017
Yeah, Mom?

01:58.768 --> 02:02.128
Come on. Enough fun!
It's time to eat. Come on, J.J.

02:02.129 --> 02:05.412
J.J.? Who's J.J.? My name's Tarzan!

02:05.529 --> 02:07.048
Kagira gave me the name.

02:07.049 --> 02:10.651
It's ape language.
It means "ape with no fur".

02:10.848 --> 02:13.655
That makes sense, little monkey.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.497
Hey, guys! Wait for Tarzan!

02:22.210 --> 02:24.811
<i>Greystoke was financing
the expedition...</i>

02:25.170 --> 02:27.498
<i>and he had become pretty impatient.</i>

02:28.010 --> 02:29.860
<i>Nothing. There's nothing here.</i>

02:30.731 --> 02:32.979
Wow. That wall of fog again.

02:33.771 --> 02:35.780
My instruments are going haywire.

02:35.811 --> 02:38.298
Okay, that's it. Expedition's over.

02:38.771 --> 02:41.702
There's absolutely no sign of your
mysterious meteor here, Porter.

02:42.571 --> 02:44.422
Great. Just great.

02:51.012 --> 02:53.651
<i>They would probably
never find this meteor,</i>

02:53.652 --> 02:55.851
<i>which according to
ancient folklore...</i>

02:55.852 --> 03:00.422
<i>possesses limitless power and
is guarded by wild monkeys.</i>

03:01.013 --> 03:03.819
<i>And who knows what other
amazing secrets...</i>

03:04.053 --> 03:07.462
<i>may lay deep within
that mysterious rock.</i>

03:13.254 --> 03:16.583
The power of the meteor is
supposed to be beyond imagination.

03:16.614 --> 03:20.057
John, we have to
continue our search.

03:20.214 --> 03:23.702
Jim, wake up.
It's just a local legend.

03:23.894 --> 03:26.495
We've searched every
square inch of this place.

03:26.534 --> 03:28.976
And the reports of the
19th century explorers?

03:29.015 --> 03:31.536
Are the romantic fantasies
of treasure hunters.

03:33.015 --> 03:34.137
And this?

03:35.175 --> 03:38.185
A lump of metal from a flea
market bin Kigali isn't proof.

03:38.775 --> 03:40.943
A word of advice between friends?

03:41.135 --> 03:44.180
Take down your tent and come
back to New York with us.

03:44.256 --> 03:47.415
You've got a beautiful wife waiting
there, and a lovely daughter.

03:47.416 --> 03:49.266
And they are real, Porter.

03:49.856 --> 03:52.423
If this meteor really
exists, it's not here.

03:55.176 --> 03:56.264
Listen!

03:56.737 --> 03:58.427
I'm Tarzan.

03:58.737 --> 04:01.907
When I come back, I'm gonna
be King of the Jungle!

04:04.217 --> 04:05.100
Tarzan?

04:06.337 --> 04:07.698
He made it up.

04:07.817 --> 04:10.544
Your son's got quite the
imagination. You know that?

04:10.858 --> 04:13.538
Must get that from your
end of the gene pool.

04:13.538 --> 04:15.024
Incorrigible dreamer, huh?

04:15.058 --> 04:18.228
Is there any other reason why you've
dragged us to the end of the world?

04:18.697 --> 04:20.707
Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!

04:20.817 --> 04:22.065
J.J., what...?

04:28.339 --> 04:31.065
- You sure you want to stay?
- You still don't get it.

04:31.259 --> 04:34.190
- The jungle's my life.
- You take care.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.306
Kiss Jane for me!

04:48.100 --> 04:50.826
John! Look! Down there.

04:52.460 --> 04:56.029
A loner. A mountain gorilla
looking for a new family.

04:56.261 --> 04:57.951
Very, very dangerous.

04:59.301 --> 05:00.912
<i>You don't wanna mess with that guy.</i>

05:07.462 --> 05:08.621
<i>By the giant waterfall,</i>

05:08.622 --> 05:10.745
<i>which had carved a deep
gorge in the jungle...</i>

05:11.382 --> 05:14.506
<i>one of the few remaining
families of mountain gorillas...</i>

05:14.542 --> 05:16.506
<i>lived in peace and harmony.</i>

05:17.262 --> 05:19.501
<i>But even their secluded hideaway...</i>

05:19.502 --> 05:21.502
<i>could not protect them
from the angry loner...</i>

05:21.503 --> 05:24.547
<i>and the hunt for a family
to take as his own.</i>

05:36.584 --> 05:40.152
<i>And so the silverbacks
had to fight.</i>

07:20.551 --> 07:22.719
<i>Look at all this volcanic activity!</i>

07:22.751 --> 07:24.919
Wow! This wasn't here two days ago!

07:41.152 --> 07:43.354
There's some kind of
magnetic interference.

07:47.393 --> 07:48.640
What is this place?

08:03.954 --> 08:05.485
<i>Get us outta here!</i>

08:06.914 --> 08:09.685
<i>- We're gonna hit the wall!</i>
- I'll pull her up!

08:11.194 --> 08:14.604
<i>Come on, come on.!
Hold on, everyone!</i>

08:25.115 --> 08:27.079
My God. Porter was right.

08:27.476 --> 08:31.044
Chris, land the bird.
I've gotta check this out.

08:35.476 --> 08:38.804
- I'll be back in an hour.
- One hour.

08:39.635 --> 08:41.076
It's getting late, okay?

08:42.797 --> 08:45.443
This place is, I don't
know, it's creepy.

08:45.597 --> 08:48.198
It's otherworldly, huh? Come on.

08:50.277 --> 08:53.401
Hey, Tarzan, Kagira,
you're in charge.

08:53.557 --> 08:56.967
- Say "bye", Kagira.
- Bye bye.

09:04.998 --> 09:07.804
Kagira told me he had a
bad dream last night.

09:07.878 --> 09:11.447
Oh no. Kagira, what did you dream?

09:11.479 --> 09:13.443
You left him behind in the jungle.

09:13.839 --> 09:18.358
Oh, silly Kagira. We would
never leave you behind.

09:18.359 --> 09:19.606
You promise?

09:20.399 --> 09:21.680
I promise.

09:21.759 --> 09:22.721
<i>Alice!</i>

09:23.599 --> 09:24.801
<i>Alice! Alice, I found it!</i>

09:25.040 --> 09:27.925
- John? What is it?
<i>- A cave.</i>

09:28.120 --> 09:30.527
<i>A cave? Are you going in there?</i>

09:30.760 --> 09:32.086
I have to.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.047
I'll be back soon.

09:35.040 --> 09:39.405
<i>And as John stepped into this most
inhospitable world cloaked in fog...</i>

09:39.881 --> 09:43.080
<i>the guardian monkeys protecting
the meteor for eons...</i>

09:43.081 --> 09:45.010
<i>became more and more agitated.</i>

09:49.281 --> 09:53.089
<i>This secret, which had been
dormant for millions of years...</i>

09:53.402 --> 09:55.491
<i>was about to be uncovered.</i>

10:54.846 --> 10:55.808
John?

10:56.366 --> 10:58.694
Can you hear me? Where are you?

11:00.726 --> 11:02.337
We really have to leave.

11:17.447 --> 11:18.809
<i>The ground shook,</i>

11:19.928 --> 11:22.654
<i>and it seemed as if all the
elements were uniting...</i>

11:23.128 --> 11:26.775
<i>to avenge the wound that John
had cut into the meteor.</i>

11:43.969 --> 11:45.375
- John!
- Dad!

11:45.449 --> 11:46.775
- What happened?
- Let's go!

11:46.809 --> 11:47.977
What happened?

12:12.371 --> 12:13.174
Get in there!

12:33.613 --> 12:35.053
Something's pulling us down!

12:42.453 --> 12:45.464
<i>And as the pilot battled
with the raging elements...</i>

12:45.654 --> 12:48.585
<i>another heart-rending tragedy
took place nearby...</i>

12:49.334 --> 12:52.663
<i>which would have momentous
consequences on things to come.</i>

13:37.857 --> 13:40.424
You never should have ripped
that thing out of the rock.

14:01.539 --> 14:02.581
You see that?

14:12.940 --> 14:14.107
Forgive me.

14:27.941 --> 14:29.506
Mommy!

14:55.183 --> 14:58.546
<i>The next morning,
Nature had calmed down.</i>

14:59.823 --> 15:02.833
<i>Karla, who had lost both
husband and baby...</i>

15:03.223 --> 15:05.346
<i>wandered heartbroken
through the jungle...</i>

15:05.943 --> 15:08.385
<i>when she came across
a strange object...</i>

15:08.504 --> 15:11.184
<i>which had fallen from the
sky the night before.</i>

15:38.026 --> 15:39.113
<i>Mommy...?</i>

16:12.308 --> 16:15.910
<i>And as Karla miraculously
gained a new child overnight...</i>

16:16.468 --> 16:21.516
<i>Tarzan found a caring hand to protect
him in the unforgiving wild.</i>

18:19.517 --> 18:23.276
<i>Karla had decided to defend
her young by any means.</i>

18:23.277 --> 18:27.767
<i>But from the start, Tarzan had become
a thorn in the side of Tublat...</i>

18:28.358 --> 18:30.959
<i>the new evil leader of
the gorilla family.</i>

18:39.678 --> 18:42.120
<i>- Something's pulling us down!
- What's pulling us down?</i>

18:42.959 --> 18:44.365
<i>Mommy!</i>

19:21.561 --> 19:24.287
<i>One... Two... Three...</i>

19:24.802 --> 19:26.731
Ready or not, here I come!

19:27.482 --> 19:29.047
Not again.

19:30.762 --> 19:32.532
I know you're here somewhere!

19:36.522 --> 19:37.848
Gotcha!

19:46.603 --> 19:47.770
Wait for me!

19:53.404 --> 19:57.403
<i>As time passed, the boy once
known as J.J. Greystoke...</i>

19:57.404 --> 19:59.686
<i>had all but ceased to exist.</i>

19:59.844 --> 20:03.412
<i>And in a world where the survival
of a young boy seemed impossible...</i>

20:03.684 --> 20:05.568
<i>he sensed a ray of hope.</i>

20:06.324 --> 20:10.849
<i>Now he really was Tarzan,
the ape without fur.</i>

25:11.746 --> 25:13.789
<i>Oh, what a beautiful butterfly!</i>

25:21.506 --> 25:24.278
Where's the gorillas?
This place blows.

25:40.548 --> 25:41.248
Derek!

25:41.388 --> 25:43.192
- Psycho.
- Beanpole.

25:43.268 --> 25:46.870
Seriously, Dad, I don't know
how you do this every summer.

25:47.068 --> 25:48.508
They pay well.

25:49.308 --> 25:51.716
And I guess you
develop a few tricks.

25:54.149 --> 25:55.396
Whoopsies.

25:59.749 --> 26:01.439
Smile, everybody!

26:14.870 --> 26:16.435
Well, here we are.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.755
Welcome to Camp Porter.

26:23.271 --> 26:25.075
This place is a dump!

26:28.191 --> 26:30.234
<i>You got here just in time.</i>

26:30.711 --> 26:32.994
<i>The gorillas are getting
tired of my jokes.</i>

26:34.352 --> 26:36.839
I've never seen stars like this.

26:37.792 --> 26:42.122
Just imagine, if you were a monkey,
you'd get to see this every night.

26:42.672 --> 26:45.478
Makes you wonder which primate
got the better deal, huh?

26:48.113 --> 26:51.044
Do you ever think
about coming home?

26:51.953 --> 26:53.484
To New York?

26:54.073 --> 26:57.436
Maybe trying things again with Mom?

26:58.273 --> 27:01.796
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but this is my home.

27:02.674 --> 27:04.160
It always was.

27:06.434 --> 27:10.525
Well, in that case, I
have to come back.

27:11.754 --> 27:14.798
Jane, my darling, nothing
would make me happier.

27:22.115 --> 27:24.079
Don't stay up too late, sweetheart.

27:24.955 --> 27:27.806
- We've got a big day tomorrow.
- Okay.

27:36.716 --> 27:37.803
Who's there?

27:44.997 --> 27:49.122
Oh! Hey. I was just out
here looking for birds.

27:50.637 --> 27:54.683
- I think I'm just gonna go this way.
- I think that's a good idea.

28:01.238 --> 28:02.280
Creep.

28:10.878 --> 28:13.605
Now remember, everyone,
stay on the trail.

28:14.039 --> 28:16.765
If you don't, we may
never find you again.

28:16.919 --> 28:20.248
And more importantly, you
shouldn't make too much noise.

28:20.359 --> 28:23.369
Unless you want to end
up on someone's menu.

28:24.079 --> 28:25.041
Derek?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.890
Derek, where are you?

28:47.721 --> 28:48.763
Cool.

28:52.601 --> 28:56.773
Listen to me, Derek.
This is very dangerous.

28:57.522 --> 29:01.886
You're going to walk
towards me very slowly.

29:02.042 --> 29:05.007
And whatever you do, don't run.

29:10.883 --> 29:11.766
Derek!

29:20.363 --> 29:23.692
Hey! Hey! Over here! Chase me!

29:49.285 --> 29:50.725
It's okay, it's okay!

30:10.647 --> 30:11.734
Who's there?

30:15.287 --> 30:16.648
That's not good.

30:34.728 --> 30:36.215
Oh, come on!

30:41.849 --> 30:43.210
Oh, no!

31:06.891 --> 31:08.013
Jane!

31:10.011 --> 31:11.451
Jane!

32:02.175 --> 32:03.183
Jane!

32:03.775 --> 32:04.703
Jane!

32:05.255 --> 32:06.581
Jane!

32:15.295 --> 32:16.543
Who are you?

32:49.258 --> 32:50.425
Jane?

32:51.258 --> 32:52.380
Jane!

32:54.338 --> 32:56.586
- Oh, Dad.
- You're here.

33:00.259 --> 33:04.225
I'm not sure if he was a
boy or some kind of ape.

33:04.979 --> 33:09.070
He had these long arms
and massive shoulders...

33:09.459 --> 33:12.583
but the purest green eyes.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.868
- Should I be concerned?
- Dad!

33:15.220 --> 33:17.070
It's a jungle, not a pick-up bar.

33:17.140 --> 33:18.421
Just asking.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.141
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

33:21.180 --> 33:25.544
It may sound weird, but in a way,
I've never felt safer in my life.

33:26.700 --> 33:31.509
<i>These were just the fantasies of a little
girl growing up before her dad's eyes.</i>

33:31.941 --> 33:35.900
<i>And she never dreamt that what she
encountered deep in the jungle...</i>

33:35.901 --> 33:39.469
<i>- was the young Greystoke heir himself.</i>
- Bye.

33:42.422 --> 33:43.669
Jane.

33:50.782 --> 33:55.032
<i>It's ape language.
It means "Ape with no fur."</i>

34:04.543 --> 34:05.630
Jane.

34:09.143 --> 34:10.630
Tarzan.

34:13.143 --> 34:14.550
Tarzan.

35:46.510 --> 35:50.193
<i>- We would never leave you behind.
- You promise?</i>

38:04.920 --> 38:08.090
<i>His friends tried everything
to make him feel better.</i>

38:08.280 --> 38:13.282
<i>But nothing could fill the void
growing deep in Tarzan's heart.</i>

39:58.648 --> 40:01.135
<i>And while Jane flew back
home to her mother...</i>

40:01.688 --> 40:06.098
<i>Tarzan was tormented by a
thousand feelings and questions.</i>

40:06.448 --> 40:08.528
<i>His world seemed to unravel...</i>

40:08.529 --> 40:12.700
<i>as a longing arose in him that
he had never felt before.</i>

40:25.650 --> 40:29.571
<i>Years passed.
Tarzan became stronger...</i>

40:30.010 --> 40:33.896
<i>and reached farther than any
other creature in the jungle.</i>

42:11.457 --> 42:12.465
<i>Mr. Clayton?</i>

42:13.137 --> 42:15.256
<i>Two hours ago, our
communication center...</i>

42:15.257 --> 42:17.620
<i>received a signal from
one of our helicopters.</i>

42:18.058 --> 42:19.066
So?

42:20.018 --> 42:21.344
It's Greystoke's.

42:23.178 --> 42:24.265
Greystoke's?

42:24.618 --> 42:27.549
After all these years. My God.

42:31.779 --> 42:33.859
- The board's ready for you, sir.
- Thanks, Amy.

42:34.059 --> 42:37.538
Mr. Clayton! If I could just
have a moment of your time...

42:37.539 --> 42:39.741
I'm with the Society
for African Wildlife.

42:40.139 --> 42:42.182
- Not again.
- Mr. Clayton!

42:42.259 --> 42:45.819
Twenty years ago, John Greystoke
made a commitment to conservation.

42:45.820 --> 42:50.184
All we're asking is a small grant,
less than 1% of your annual profits.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.871
What did you say your name was?

42:52.620 --> 42:54.822
Jane. Jane Porter.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.341
I'll tell you what, Jane.
Can you stick around?

42:57.420 --> 42:59.191
I've got a board meeting now.

42:59.381 --> 43:00.821
Give me 30 minutes, okay?

43:01.101 --> 43:02.905
- Great.
- Fine.

43:06.461 --> 43:08.709
Seventy million years ago...

43:09.621 --> 43:13.508
this planet was struck by
an extraterrestrial object.

43:14.022 --> 43:16.907
But this was not just any meteor.

43:17.702 --> 43:19.552
This was something else.

43:19.982 --> 43:24.621
This was a new energy source
unlike anything we had ever seen.

43:24.622 --> 43:29.622
We believe that the meteor is
buried in a mantle of cooled lava.

43:29.623 --> 43:33.305
The technological
potential is limitless.

43:34.663 --> 43:36.592
This was the treasure...

43:37.223 --> 43:40.313
that John Greystoke spent his
life attempting to find.

43:40.663 --> 43:43.515
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, we...

43:44.064 --> 43:46.823
should follow in the footsteps
of John Greystoke himself

43:46.824 --> 43:49.994
and blaze new paths in
energy production...

43:50.264 --> 43:52.193
at profits...

43:53.104 --> 43:54.749
he could never have dreamed of.

43:55.304 --> 43:56.666
I'm certain...

43:57.945 --> 44:01.228
that if we find Greystoke,
or what's left of him...

44:01.705 --> 44:03.316
we'll find that meteor.

44:03.465 --> 44:06.544
As you know, our competitors
are watching our every move.

44:06.545 --> 44:09.864
Now, we need a cover. Some way
to get close to the crash...

44:09.865 --> 44:12.672
without anyone knowing
why we're there.

44:13.186 --> 44:14.433
I know a way.

44:15.466 --> 44:17.953
Ah, Jane. There you are.

44:19.026 --> 44:20.425
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

44:20.426 --> 44:23.470
I'm so eager to find out
more about your foundation.

44:24.827 --> 44:26.153
And how's your dad?

44:37.067 --> 44:39.839
Hey! I want to take a
closer look at that gorge.

45:29.351 --> 45:30.677
Hey! Darling!

45:31.391 --> 45:35.562
I swear, you get more
beautiful every year!

45:36.432 --> 45:38.475
So good to see you again, Daddy!

45:39.832 --> 45:41.477
I missed you so much.

45:42.592 --> 45:45.079
And you must be Mr. Clayton.

45:45.152 --> 45:48.071
I can't tell you how much it
means to have your support.

45:48.072 --> 45:50.161
Oh, well, don't thank me.
Thank Jane.

45:50.273 --> 45:51.953
She wouldn't take
"no" for an answer.

45:52.873 --> 45:55.360
Yes, and that's my
associate, Mr. Smith.

45:56.553 --> 45:58.562
He's environmentally challenged.

46:02.193 --> 46:03.912
Well, I'm gonna settle in.

46:03.913 --> 46:06.481
Okay, darling.
Make yourself at home.

46:06.794 --> 46:09.838
<i>So, this is your tent.
And watch out for the ants.</i>

46:10.994 --> 46:13.322
<i>I forgot to tell you.
The ants bite.</i>

46:22.995 --> 46:26.199
What with global warming,
logging, and regional conflict...

46:26.235 --> 46:28.597
this eco-system has never
been more threatened.

46:28.795 --> 46:32.636
I tell you, there's nothing more
frustrating than standing around

46:33.156 --> 46:34.881
helplessly while the
jungle vanishes.

46:35.356 --> 46:39.447
What he's trying to say is
thank you. Right, Dad?

46:40.076 --> 46:41.277
Of course.

47:52.921 --> 47:54.202
Goodnight, everyone.

47:54.641 --> 47:56.481
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

48:01.802 --> 48:03.447
I think I better turn in as well.

48:18.803 --> 48:20.004
Monkeys.

48:28.684 --> 48:30.454
What do you want, Clayton?

48:32.404 --> 48:33.163
Excuse me?

48:33.164 --> 48:35.571
Well, ever since you took
over Greystoke Energies,

48:35.644 --> 48:37.414
you've ignored this place.

48:37.604 --> 48:40.723
And then, all of a sudden,
after, what, fifteen years...

48:40.724 --> 48:44.486
you decide to pop halfway across
the earth for an impromptu safari?

48:44.565 --> 48:46.005
Please!

48:46.125 --> 48:49.215
So what do you want?

48:51.565 --> 48:53.847
The same thing that
John Greystoke wanted.

48:54.685 --> 48:58.607
Did you ever consider there was a
reason why Greystoke perished?

48:58.846 --> 49:03.370
That perhaps there are some things
that are not meant to be discovered.

49:04.126 --> 49:07.250
Porter, you'd better
start calming down.

49:07.446 --> 49:09.245
You've hit the
jackpot, haven't you?

49:09.246 --> 49:12.486
Greystoke Energies is about to start
financing your ridiculous research...

49:12.487 --> 49:16.214
into the "cradle of civilization" again.
You'd better cooperate.

49:18.807 --> 49:22.853
That's a very pretty
daughter you've got there.

49:23.207 --> 49:26.491
We wouldn't want anything
to happen to her, would we?

49:45.689 --> 49:46.936
Who's there?

49:55.970 --> 49:57.012
Jane.

49:57.930 --> 49:59.017
You?

50:00.050 --> 50:01.820
You're, you're real.

50:02.930 --> 50:06.100
All these years, I wasn't
sure it actually happened.

50:07.330 --> 50:08.453
<i>These mosquitoes.</i>

50:09.251 --> 50:10.657
Wait! Don't go!

50:30.292 --> 50:31.539
What are you doing?

50:33.452 --> 50:36.384
- Don't sneak up on me like that.
- What is this?

50:37.933 --> 50:39.942
Oh, really it's just...

50:40.213 --> 50:43.052
for detecting a highly
radioactive meteor.

50:43.053 --> 50:44.254
A what?

50:44.333 --> 50:47.935
- There you are!
- You lied to me, Clayton!

50:48.013 --> 50:50.102
You said you want to
support the foundation.

50:50.173 --> 50:52.581
You said there were
no strings attached.

50:53.054 --> 50:53.982
Oh, Jane.

50:54.614 --> 50:56.774
Don't you know, there are
always strings attached.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.380
Isn't that right, Porter?

51:03.214 --> 51:04.576
Now I understand.

51:05.655 --> 51:07.983
God, how could I be such an idiot?

51:08.175 --> 51:10.537
You've been lying to me
the whole time, Dad!

51:11.255 --> 51:15.255
Jane, wait! That's not true! Jane!

51:16.455 --> 51:18.975
I hope you're happy. Relax.

51:18.976 --> 51:20.780
We all have to grow up sometime.

51:22.416 --> 51:23.538
Jane!

51:28.896 --> 51:29.983
Jane!

51:58.378 --> 51:59.340
Jane!

54:05.547 --> 54:07.556
Oh, no, no, no! Thank you.

54:09.187 --> 54:10.275
Don't! Don't.

54:11.948 --> 54:13.752
- Classy.
- Classy.

54:16.948 --> 54:17.956
You can talk.

54:18.948 --> 54:19.956
Talk.

54:21.908 --> 54:23.394
What is your name?

54:25.349 --> 54:26.311
Name?

54:27.109 --> 54:28.196
Yes.

54:28.909 --> 54:31.510
Name. What is your name?

54:34.869 --> 54:37.993
Jane. My name is Jane.

54:42.310 --> 54:43.238
My...

54:43.830 --> 54:44.917
name...

54:45.630 --> 54:46.797
Jane.

54:48.590 --> 54:49.598
No.

54:51.870 --> 54:54.312
My name is Jane.

54:55.191 --> 54:57.519
What is your name?

55:01.071 --> 55:02.432
Tarzan.

55:04.151 --> 55:05.273
Tarzan.

55:05.871 --> 55:06.958
Tarzan.

55:07.792 --> 55:09.039
Tarzan.

55:10.712 --> 55:11.720
Jane.

55:13.312 --> 55:14.877
Me Tarzan.

55:15.832 --> 55:18.876
- You Jane.
- Yes.

55:19.672 --> 55:23.320
Me Tarzan, you Jane!
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

55:23.433 --> 55:25.397
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

55:25.713 --> 55:28.393
- Me Tarzan, you Jane!
- Jane.

55:29.633 --> 55:31.483
Me Tarzan, you Jane!

55:33.593 --> 55:34.476
Jane!

56:48.119 --> 56:50.765
- Jane eat.
- Yes, sir.

56:57.879 --> 56:59.285
Whoever you are,

56:59.839 --> 57:03.362
whatever riddle is buried
inside you, Tarzan,

57:04.720 --> 57:08.288
I feel like I've always known you.

57:23.001 --> 57:25.602
- Do you have a name?
- Rafiki.

57:26.801 --> 57:29.368
Watch over Tarzan
when Tarzan sleep.

57:38.002 --> 57:39.010
For me?

57:41.202 --> 57:42.847
It's beautiful.

57:46.483 --> 57:48.765
My father has one just like it.

57:50.043 --> 57:51.688
Where did you find it?

57:58.563 --> 58:00.766
Smith, may I have the
coordinates, please?

58:01.524 --> 58:03.055
It should be right here.

58:03.244 --> 58:04.206
Jane?

58:07.084 --> 58:08.968
Oh, my God! It's Jane!

58:14.405 --> 58:15.413
Greystoke...?

58:16.485 --> 58:19.165
- No, that's impossible.
- What did you say?

58:21.405 --> 58:23.846
It is Jane. Some giant ape has her.

58:24.245 --> 58:26.049
No, no! Don't shoot!

58:27.526 --> 58:29.774
- You might hit Jane!
- Come on!

58:30.806 --> 58:32.974
No! No! Don't shoot!

58:56.688 --> 58:57.571
Come on!

59:24.409 --> 59:27.689
<i>On the run from Clayton, they
entered a strange world...</i>

59:27.690 --> 59:29.733
<i>never before seen by man.</i>

59:30.210 --> 59:32.809
<i>A world which had been
under the influence...</i>

59:32.810 --> 59:36.901
<i>of the meteor's mysterious
energy for millions of years.</i>

59:49.931 --> 59:50.893
Thanks.

01:00:34.774 --> 01:00:35.702
Tarzan!

01:01:34.219 --> 01:01:35.830
We better get outta here.

01:04:35.551 --> 01:04:39.393
This must be what my father and
Greystoke were looking for.

01:04:42.392 --> 01:04:43.923
Greystoke...

01:04:46.752 --> 01:04:48.442
You remember this place.

01:04:51.312 --> 01:04:52.559
Of course!

01:04:52.832 --> 01:04:56.162
You're the boy!
You're Greystoke's son!

01:04:56.433 --> 01:05:00.319
But how were you able to
survive for all these years?

01:05:00.633 --> 01:05:02.562
My family told me.

01:05:02.993 --> 01:05:04.433
Your family?

01:06:08.358 --> 01:06:09.605
Oh, hi.

01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:56.891
Nice to meet you, too.

01:10:51.778 --> 01:10:54.026
Tarzan, I have to go
back to the camp.

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:57.542
Jane is angry with Tarzan?

01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:01.303
No, Tarzan. I'm not angry.

01:11:02.338 --> 01:11:05.304
But my father will not
rest until he finds me.

01:11:05.459 --> 01:11:08.788
And Clayton will kill you if he finds
out Greystoke's heir is alive.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:13.458
As long as I'm here,
you and your family...

01:11:13.459 --> 01:11:15.778
and this beautiful
paradise are in danger.

01:11:15.779 --> 01:11:17.026
Tarzan strong!

01:11:18.339 --> 01:11:20.030
Tarzan King of the Jungle!

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.986
I know, Tarzan.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.668
But we can't fight Clayton's army.

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.751
Bring it in! This way!

01:12:06.263 --> 01:12:09.512
<i>Meanwhile the camp had
undergone great changes...</i>

01:12:09.823 --> 01:12:10.622
Keep going!

01:12:10.623 --> 01:12:15.863
<i>As Clayton had made good on his threat
to find the meteor by any means.</i>

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.754
Hurry up, men!
We don't have all night!

01:12:37.545 --> 01:12:39.235
I love you, Tarzan.

01:12:40.505 --> 01:12:42.469
And I always will.

01:12:46.266 --> 01:12:47.627
I have to go.

01:13:05.267 --> 01:13:07.913
Our little runaway has
come back then, eh?

01:13:08.107 --> 01:13:10.628
Hello. What have we here?

01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:17.310
Don't!

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:23.038
Young Greystoke. Or do you
prefer "King of the Apes"?

01:13:24.588 --> 01:13:26.756
The resemblance is uncanny.

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:30.673
Although you have a ways to go in
the wardrobe department, don't you?

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:39.116
You stay out of my way, savage.

01:13:39.869 --> 01:13:42.311
The only savage here
is you, Clayton.

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:46.715
Mr. Greystoke, would you be so
kind as to bring us to the meteor?

01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:48.797
Never.

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:52.439
Then unfortunately, we'll
have to go our separate ways.

01:14:01.391 --> 01:14:02.319
No!

01:14:32.313 --> 01:14:35.323
- Tarzan!
- Take her to her father.

01:14:35.473 --> 01:14:37.641
Tarzan!

01:14:39.034 --> 01:14:40.315
Jane!

01:14:42.234 --> 01:14:43.845
Tarzan!

01:16:52.683 --> 01:16:53.645
Just think...

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:58.482
the potential energy stored
in this one tiny piece...

01:16:58.483 --> 01:17:00.924
could power the entire
East coast for a month.

01:17:01.403 --> 01:17:03.208
Think what we could
do with a mountain.

01:17:05.084 --> 01:17:08.413
I'll tell you what: you
take me to the meteor...

01:17:09.404 --> 01:17:10.730
I'll set you both free.

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:12.643
Like hell I will!

01:17:12.644 --> 01:17:17.851
Jane, your time with the monkey man
is starting to rub off on you.

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:21.053
Unfortunately,
he's managed to escape.

01:17:21.445 --> 01:17:26.287
But Miller here and his friends are going
to follow the trail of your "ape"...

01:17:26.765 --> 01:17:29.366
who obviously means
so much to you, Jane.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:33.773
And he's going to take care
of both him and his gang.

01:17:35.246 --> 01:17:36.936
I'll take you to the place.

01:17:38.526 --> 01:17:40.569
But you won't need
to look for Tarzan.

01:17:41.286 --> 01:17:42.772
He'll find you!

01:18:25.649 --> 01:18:27.260
Look out! Incoming!

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:29.653
My grandma's quicker than you guys!

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:42.293
<i>Hook it up and let's
get out of here!</i>

01:18:52.891 --> 01:18:54.934
<i>Start moving!</i>

01:19:16.773 --> 01:19:20.216
Detonation in ten minutes!
Clear the blast zone!

01:19:30.814 --> 01:19:31.856
What the...?

01:19:41.295 --> 01:19:43.702
<i>Detonation in eight minutes.</i>

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.225
I knew there was a meteor.

01:19:46.455 --> 01:19:49.943
Isn't it beautiful?
Like a gigantic diamond.

01:19:50.015 --> 01:19:54.460
A mountain of unknown elements
from the depths of the universe!

01:19:54.536 --> 01:19:56.704
A gift from outer space.

01:19:56.896 --> 01:20:01.226
Dad, seriously, we'll be blown
to pieces in a few minutes.

01:20:01.536 --> 01:20:03.818
We'd better find a way
to get out of here.

01:20:05.576 --> 01:20:07.825
Of course. You're right, my love.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:09.743
<i>Hello, love.</i>

01:20:10.977 --> 01:20:12.827
I just want to say goodbye.

01:20:14.257 --> 01:20:15.583
Don't touch me!

01:20:25.618 --> 01:20:27.900
<i>Detonation in six minutes.</i>

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:29.866
Timing.

01:20:34.258 --> 01:20:36.461
You don't know how
much I missed you!

01:20:38.419 --> 01:20:41.907
- This is my dad.
- J.J.? I can't believe it's you!

01:20:41.979 --> 01:20:44.705
- Look how big you've got!
- Boys!

01:20:44.939 --> 01:20:47.983
When you're done here, can
we please stop Clayton?

01:20:50.059 --> 01:20:51.421
Dad! Come on!

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.067
You go and I'll stay
here and cut the cables.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:57.111
- I'm not leaving without you.
- It's our only chance.

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.547
Don't worry.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.308
<i>Detonation in four minutes.</i>

01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:08.622
Dad, hurry!

01:21:08.981 --> 01:21:10.387
I'll be there in a minute!

01:21:18.982 --> 01:21:21.230
<i>Detonation in two minutes.</i>

01:21:24.142 --> 01:21:25.753
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:21:30.422 --> 01:21:31.350
Do it.

01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:33.070
No!

01:21:36.783 --> 01:21:37.870
What happened?

01:21:40.943 --> 01:21:42.952
You again. I should have known.

01:21:43.503 --> 01:21:45.193
What's next, jungle boy?

01:22:15.385 --> 01:22:16.951
Don't monkey with me.

01:22:41.987 --> 01:22:43.996
Oh, my God! Dad's still down there!

01:23:11.789 --> 01:23:13.435
Hurry! Come on!

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:21.799
Go! Go!

01:23:30.751 --> 01:23:31.952
- Stay on them.
- Yeah.

01:23:41.952 --> 01:23:43.722
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

01:24:29.195 --> 01:24:30.317
Please!

01:24:30.755 --> 01:24:32.241
Don't let me go!

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.277
Never.

01:24:50.756 --> 01:24:52.117
They're getting away!

01:25:34.599 --> 01:25:36.529
Let's go home, Tarzan.

01:26:55.605 --> 01:26:58.649
Now Tarzan watch over Jane forever.

01:26:59.845 --> 01:27:01.410
I know, Tarzan.

01:27:01.765 --> 01:27:04.731
And if anyone threatens
this paradise again...

01:27:05.326 --> 01:27:07.255
they'll have to deal with us.

01:27:07.726 --> 01:27:08.848
Right, Rafiki?

01:27:21.807 --> 01:27:23.726
<i>And as Tarzan, Jane,
and their friends...</i>

01:27:23.727 --> 01:27:26.009
<i>celebrated their victory
over Clayton...</i>

01:27:26.167 --> 01:27:28.966
<i>Tarzan found the one
thing more powerful...</i>

01:27:28.967 --> 01:27:31.296
<i>than all the energy
in the universe...</i>

01:27:31.968 --> 01:27:33.852
<i>the love of a woman.</i>

01:27:35.448 --> 01:27:39.175
<i>As for Porter, he's a
scientist and adventurer.</i>

01:27:39.648 --> 01:27:41.213
<i>But what kind of adventurer...</i>

01:27:41.408 --> 01:27:43.975
<i>would let a simple
old rock defeat him?</i>

01:27:44.305 --> 01:27:50.778
