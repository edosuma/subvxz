WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.736
The final season of New Girl

00:02.770 --> 00:04.905
celebrates friends to the end.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.807
I'm gonna go open
a bottle of wine.
Pink okay?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.478
And check out
our other Fox shows--

00:10.511 --> 00:12.713
LA to Vegas, Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:12.746 --> 00:14.582
-and The Last Man on Earth.
-(laughs)

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.655
I can't believe
we still haven't told them.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.392
I guess it just was never
the right time.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.328
Well, I guess
we're simply out of time.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.263
(phone rings)

00:29.297 --> 00:32.666
-You're on with Schmidt
and Cece. -Ruth's on!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.335
JESS: Hey, you're on with Jess
and Nick. I'm patching in

00:34.368 --> 00:35.903
Winston, Aly and Dan Bill.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.505
Are we really calling him
Dan Bill?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.573
It sounds like a weird town
in Connecticut.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.842
It's their child.
Their mistake to make, okay?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.245
-(Muzak playing)
-Mm. That's a nice touch.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.846
CECE:
Yeah, good vibe, good vibe.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.848
-Hella?
-JESS: It's Jess and Nick.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.184
-I'm patching in Schmidt,
Cece and Ruth. -(beeps)

00:50.218 --> 00:52.853
Cece, Schmidt and Ruth,
you're on with Jess, Nick,

00:52.886 --> 00:54.522
Winston, Aly and Dan Bill.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.357
-Hey, Jess, Nick, Dan Bill...
-Hey, Winston, Dan Bill...

00:56.390 --> 00:57.458
-Winston and Aly.
-Jess and Nick.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.959
Who are these people?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.361
Hey, Schmidt, Cece,
Ruth, Jess and Nick.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.529
JESS:
Guys, I only have the strength

01:01.562 --> 01:03.131
to say this once.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.865
Here I go.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.867
Oh, God, how do I put this
into words?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.703
Okay, make it quick, 'cause
my phone is at four percent,

01:09.737 --> 01:11.572
and Ruth has turned my charger
into a very sensible belt.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.242
Schmidt, just switch your phone
to low battery mode. It really

01:14.275 --> 01:16.610
-lengthens battery life. -How do
you do that? Walk me through it.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.579
-Go to Utilities. -No, no,
Settings. Go to Settings.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.414
-Okay, well, I'm-I'm in
Settings. Oh, shoot. -Guys,

01:20.448 --> 01:21.415
-please...
-Now I'm at three percent.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.451
I have something important
to say!

01:23.484 --> 01:24.618
WINSTON: And then, uh,
open your Control Center.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.120
-Battery. Select Battery.
-Enough!

01:26.154 --> 01:27.455
-Oh, no, I got it. -Jess
has something really important

01:27.488 --> 01:29.957
to say, so everybody shut up!

01:31.759 --> 01:33.461
Jess, go ahead.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.463
Ugh!

01:35.496 --> 01:37.265
I can't tell you this
over the phone.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.133
Get over here
before it's too late.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.634
She can tell you,
she can tell you. Go ahead.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.636
-Bye.
-Oh! What a waste of...

01:42.670 --> 01:44.905
Good job.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.440
-What is it? -Tell us.
-You're getting divorced?

01:46.474 --> 01:47.641
Well, that lasted a month.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.410
What? No! Jess, go ahead.

01:49.443 --> 01:53.147
I hate to be the bearer
of truly terrible news...

01:53.181 --> 01:54.815
Jess, can you please tell us?
I'm so scared.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.817
You should be. This is...

01:56.850 --> 01:59.153
(sighs)
this is life-changing stuff.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.754
Brace yourselves.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.757
Nick and I are...

02:03.791 --> 02:06.160
moving out of the loft.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.298
-That's it?
-Okay.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.932
SCHMIDT: That's what
you called us here for?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.767
Why do you always think
like a character

02:13.801 --> 02:15.603
-in The Baby-Sitters Club?
-(Cece sighs) -Okay, okay,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.605
you guys process this
however you need to.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.673
You're probably wondering
why we would ever move out

02:19.707 --> 02:21.675
-in the first place. -Yeah,
honey, you should've moved out

02:21.709 --> 02:23.277
when the elevator plunged
into the basement

02:23.311 --> 02:25.112
-and killed the mailman.
-We got an eviction notice.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.781
They're kicking us out
in 24 hours.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.951
Some evil company called Engram
Pattersky Management Group

02:30.984 --> 02:32.453
bought the building.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.121
Yeah, they're kicking us out
on our...

02:34.154 --> 02:36.123
"too-tookuses."

02:36.156 --> 02:37.458
You trying to say "tuchases"?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.792
"Tuchaseses."

02:38.826 --> 02:40.361
-"Tuchas"?
-"Tookases."

02:40.394 --> 02:43.030
Luckily, Nick and I found
a very nice two-bedroom

02:43.063 --> 02:45.699
with a lovely reading nook.
That doesn't matter.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.368
The point is,
we're moving out tomorrow,

02:47.401 --> 02:49.537
and I know how much this place
means to you guys, so...

02:49.570 --> 02:52.139
whatever you're thinking
or feeling,

02:52.172 --> 02:53.641
I want you to get it out.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
So whoever wants to go first...

02:58.912 --> 03:01.382
Okay, I don't think
you guys fully heard me.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.385
(chuckles)
So I'm gonna say it again.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.720
Nick and I are m...

03:06.754 --> 03:08.522
*

03:10.090 --> 03:11.492
...moving out of the loft.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.660
Okay, if you're moving out
tomorrow,

03:12.693 --> 03:13.994
why have you not packed yet?

03:14.027 --> 03:14.995
Don't packing-shame us!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.163
We're well on our way.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.365
We got four boxes right there.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.233
I ran out of tape,
so I started using glue.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.568
We'll see how it holds up.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.337
Cool. Anyway, uh,
I'm taking off.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.572
Hey, let me know
when you have the housewarming

03:24.605 --> 03:26.507
for your new place.
I'll bring the succulents.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.742
You never brought us succulents.
We love succulents.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.878
Ah, you got me. I don't know
what a succulent is.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.180
I just said that so I can get
the hell out of here. (chuckles)

03:33.213 --> 03:34.582
But I really do got

03:34.615 --> 03:37.351
to get going.
It's my turn to nurse the baby.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.186
-How does he...
-It's a whole thing.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.589
Wow, you guys are in
so much denial. You're so upset

03:41.622 --> 03:44.091
by this news
that you're distracting yourself

03:44.124 --> 03:47.861
with nonsense like-like
succulents and newborn babies.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.398
Uh, we left Ruth with
our neighbor's stepson, Yonk,

03:50.431 --> 03:52.032
so we're gonna go.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.734
CECE: Yeah, honey,
we're not in denial, okay?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.736
We've just done everything
we need to do in this loft.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.204
We're ready to say good-bye.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.940
Right. Right. Yeah.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.909
Yeah, Cece, you're right.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.911
You're totally right.
You're all...

04:03.944 --> 04:05.913
totally right.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.748
Or are you wrong?!

04:07.781 --> 04:11.552
Nobody leaves
until we celebrate this place!

04:11.585 --> 04:14.221
-(groaning) -Okay? So call
your sitters, call your babies,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.123
get all your affairs in order.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.158
I'm gonna go open
a bottle of wine. Pink okay?

04:18.191 --> 04:21.795
-Well, I guess I'll call Yonk
and tell him to get cozy. -Ugh.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.931
Ugh, I can hear Yonk now.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.566
(with accent):
"Mr. Schmidt, I got thirsty.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.234
I drank all your coconut water."

04:27.267 --> 04:29.136
Freakin' Yonk.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.104
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.240
Okay, why are we hiding
in your office?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.075
Because, guys, look,
I love my wife.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.277
You guys know that I love
my wife. But she's clearly going

04:37.311 --> 04:39.647
through something about us
leaving the loft. It's like...

04:39.680 --> 04:41.949
it's like she's having a really
hard time getting her mouth

04:41.982 --> 04:43.784
around the sandwich,
do you know what I mean?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.153
If you guys want to get out
of here, which I know you do,

04:46.186 --> 04:48.489
then you will laugh
when she says laugh,

04:48.522 --> 04:51.158
you will cry when she says cry,

04:51.191 --> 04:52.960
and in between,
we're gonna pack.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.662
I really miss the old days
when I would just drop in

04:54.695 --> 04:57.097
every now and then and pick up
a suitcase or something.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.166
I only have the moving truck
for 24 hours.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.801
If I go one minute over,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.471
those bastards will charge me
for a whole nother day.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.306
If you get a whole nother day,
might as well get a second week.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.142
You get a second week,
you might as well buy the truck,

05:09.176 --> 05:11.979
'cause you're livin' in it,
Charlie! You live in a mo...

05:12.012 --> 05:14.848
The point I'm trying to make
is we need to pack right now.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.316
I love packing.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.151
You wouldn't believe
how good I am

05:18.185 --> 05:21.154
at fitting multiple things
into small spaces.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.323
-I'm a bento box boy.
-(chuckling)

05:23.357 --> 05:25.859
What's in that box?

05:25.893 --> 05:28.161
-What? -What's the box
that says "gross stuff," man?

05:29.196 --> 05:30.864
Jessica's underpants.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.200
SCHMIDT: You have Jess's
panties in a box?

05:33.233 --> 05:36.236
Well, while I'm delighted

05:36.269 --> 05:38.506
that you have a box...

05:38.539 --> 05:41.341
labeled "gross stuff"
of your wife's...

05:41.375 --> 05:43.343
undergarments, uh,

05:43.377 --> 05:46.514
I also feel
like you may be lying to me.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.549
JESS:
Yoo-hoo, guys! Yoo-hoo!

05:48.582 --> 05:50.818
Yoo-frickin'-hoo!

05:50.851 --> 05:53.887
Just remember, if you want
to get out of here, play along.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.356
*

06:04.532 --> 06:06.233
Behold!

06:06.266 --> 06:09.202
Objects from your past
to make you remember and...

06:09.236 --> 06:10.904
Oh, God, the chair
is still spinning. Oh, my God.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.706
You guys, I'm on a dolly.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.341
I'm on a greased up dolly,
and I'm holding fire.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.076
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

06:16.109 --> 06:17.911
If we scatter now,
one of us can get out

06:17.945 --> 06:20.080
and bring help for the rest.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.419
Take in the memories. Let
these objects be the milkshake

06:25.453 --> 06:28.789
that bring your memory boys
to the emotion yard.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.524
-I swore we threw all this stuff
away. -Wow, I can't believe you

06:30.558 --> 06:32.793
-saved all this stuff. How cool
is that? -But we're really happy

06:32.826 --> 06:34.862
-it's back. We're all
really happy. Thank you. -Yeah.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.597
I knew you guys
needed to say good-bye.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.432
(chuckles)
Isn't it amazing how easy it is

06:38.466 --> 06:41.869
to do the right thing when
you have no other alternative?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.136
Totally.
(chuckles)

06:43.170 --> 06:44.371
Like this.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.107
Ah, the old loft candy dish.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.609
(inhales deeply)

06:48.642 --> 06:51.378
-That's the cast from when
I broke my penis. -(screams)

06:51.411 --> 06:54.314
-Shut up! -You know, most
people wouldn't want to revisit

06:54.347 --> 06:56.550
some of the more painful moments
in their lives, but,

06:56.584 --> 06:58.986
you know what, Jess,
thank you for this, 'cause I do.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.320
Thank you.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.722
Oh, Schmidt, you take that.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.457
-(stammers)
-You're gonna want it.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.293
Honestly, it's your penis.
You earned it.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.061
-Put it in your purse. Go put it
in your purse. -Excuse me?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.497
-I am not putting it
in my purse. -Please, Cece,

07:09.530 --> 07:10.964
-just put it in your purse.
-I am not gonna go put it...

07:10.998 --> 07:12.633
-We'll just leave it here.
-We'll put it right there.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.636
-Remember this? -NICK: Oh! Looks
just like us! -(Cece laughs)

07:15.669 --> 07:18.739
-We always pose like that. -Can
we talk about those skin tones?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.475
Oh, Nick,
this one is so special.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.477
-WINSTON: Wow.
-The wand I used to fix the, uh,

07:23.511 --> 07:25.312
garbage disposal. That one time.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.914
(voice breaking):
Did we find the garbage wand

07:26.947 --> 07:29.349
or did the garbage wand find us?

07:29.382 --> 07:31.351
I remember the day I found it.
I thought,

07:31.384 --> 07:32.986
"Free stick."

07:33.020 --> 07:34.421
-Ha!
-Then I brought it home,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.256
and it fit into the sink hole.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.525
-Mm.
-And somewhere along

07:37.558 --> 07:39.927
the way, it fixed my heart hole.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.362
-It fixed your heart hole?
-So, thank you, stick.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.764
-SCHMIDT: Okay.
-CECE: I have a tear.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.265
-WINSTON: That about sums it up.
-Yeah. -Yeah.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.600
Jess, I will never,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.468
ever forget the night
that you brought us

07:48.502 --> 07:51.304
all together to show us a bunch
of our old trash.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.339
-CECE: We should let you pack.
-Okay.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.275
-Thank you. -No!
-Thank you so... Huh?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.610
No one's going anywhere.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.111
We're gonna do all the things
in the loft

07:58.145 --> 07:59.279
that we haven't done before.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.982
-Like what?
-(scoffs)

08:02.015 --> 08:03.617
I can't believe we've never
all stood out

08:03.651 --> 08:05.118
on the balcony together.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.955
You know who else
liked balconies? Hitler.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.023
Let's go inside.
Let's do more things.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.960
I can't believe you've never
cleaned the oven, Cece.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.697
I think, I think if we just
do this,

08:16.730 --> 08:19.032
and this, and turn it up
real high...

08:19.066 --> 08:21.201
I heard that that could work.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.536
Yeah. What else should we do?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.504
We could all just pack
and move Jess and I

08:24.538 --> 08:26.807
out of the loft;
we've never done that.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.842
It's a joke. It's a joke
for sentimentals.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.678
-It's a sentimental joke.
-Oh. I know.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.345
Th-This is a big one.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.714
You know, I've never looked
around the corner,

08:33.747 --> 08:35.048
in the hallway
past the bathroom.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.149
Like, what's over there?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.484
Oh my God, what is over there?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.852
-What is over there?
-Yeah.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.021
-Whose team are you on?
-I play for myself.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.859
It's just a wall.

08:45.893 --> 08:49.162
My turn. Cece and I need
to use the urinals.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.731
Follow me.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.367
Oh, n-n-no, no, no, no, no.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.369
You just opened Pantera's box.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.671
We do not have time for this
right now.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.907
We will get in...

09:07.781 --> 09:09.717
Peppermint lotion?

09:09.750 --> 09:12.119
It's for your feet.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.222
Yay. I love it.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.690
I knew it!

09:16.724 --> 09:18.759
-Nailed it.
-Great gift.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.127
Oh, I'm gonna get you one
every year.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.595
And we're gonna be
best friends forever.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.896
I just met you, like,
a week ago.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.532
Uh, just 'cause it says
"peppermint,"

09:25.565 --> 09:27.200
non-edible.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.703
I never would have thought
to eat this lotion.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.039
Nicholas, I have been giving you
that lotion

09:32.072 --> 09:34.441
-every year since we met.
-I know.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.210
I wanted you to experience soft
feet for once in your life,

09:37.244 --> 09:40.547
-and you... and you lied to me.
-What did you want me to do?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
I had just met you when
you first gave it to me.

09:42.616 --> 09:46.053
Then you actually gave me the
lotion again the following year.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.722
And the lie got on top of me.
And now I got all these bottles

09:48.756 --> 09:50.557
of lotion and I don't even know
how to do this stuff.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.826
You don't know how to "do"
foot lotion?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.795
What if I put it on
and my feet get...

09:54.828 --> 09:57.397
I don't know,
too wet and creamy?

09:57.430 --> 10:00.067
Has everything been a lie?
Has this whole relationship...?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.769
Don't call it a relationship,
it's a friendship.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.304
Don't belittle what we have
by calling it a friendship.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.406
-No, please. -Oh, we don't love
each other in Chicago.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.908
We're just friends.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.243
Please, just get over this
and help me pack.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.812
Sure. You've lied to me
for years,

10:11.845 --> 10:14.081
but let's just ignore it
so I can help you pack

10:14.114 --> 10:15.582
while humoring your wife

10:15.615 --> 10:17.617
-pretending to care.
-JESS: What?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.988
You guys were humoring me?

10:21.021 --> 10:24.124
Nick, you told everyone
to pretend to care?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.994
Jess, it's not about that.
It's about the truck.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.096
I didn't want to go a minute
over the 24 hours,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.164
because then I, you know,
I need to pay for a second day.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.833
Jess.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.102
Wait, Jess. I'm sorry.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.438
You guys were just
playing along with this?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.809
I thought you were just
starting to feel something.

10:41.842 --> 10:46.279
Wait. Am I the one who's in
denial about leaving this place?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.816
Ugh, you sweet,
goblin-eyed dum-dum.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.950
CECE:
Babe, I think the rest of us

10:49.983 --> 10:52.119
have already made peace
with this.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.854
No, I get it.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.622
I'm not mad. I just...

10:55.655 --> 10:58.125
People live together in
apartments all the time.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.627
And you guys have lives
and kids.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.130
And this is just a place.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.833
But to me, this is the place
where I met all of you.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.134
-And that's...
-(sighs)

11:07.167 --> 11:09.469
...that's the best thing that...

11:09.502 --> 11:11.338
that ever happened to me, so...

11:12.172 --> 11:14.341
Consider yourselves freed.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.377
The lock never
really worked, anyway.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.184
Put that down.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.986
We are not going anywhere.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.155
Yeah, we're gonna say good-bye
all day.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.990
-All day.
-All day!

11:30.023 --> 11:31.725
-What? -That's not it.
-You don't say it,

11:31.759 --> 11:33.660
you don't say it like that.
It's like, all day.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.195
-All...
-All day!

11:35.228 --> 11:37.731
Guys, second day

11:37.765 --> 11:40.167
-of a moving truck on me.
-CECE: There we go.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.335
-SCHMIDT: That's a big step.
-Thank you.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.237
But I'm not doing the insurance.
I won't do it. I can't do it.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.739
-It's a rip-off. It's a freakin'
rip-off. -Chill, chill, bro.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.707
* Who's that girl? *

11:47.741 --> 11:50.010
* Who's that
girl? *

11:50.043 --> 11:53.213
* It's your favorite bitch,
Jess *

11:53.246 --> 11:55.515
* Hang on to your privates
'cause I'm *

11:55.548 --> 11:57.684
* On emotional fy-ahh *

11:57.717 --> 12:00.253
(imitates guitar)

12:00.287 --> 12:02.222
Don't look so surprised, guys.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.624
-You knew what this was.
-(vocalizing)

12:07.594 --> 12:09.262
WINSTON:
Ah, we had some times here.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.032
-Mmm.
-I mean this, right here,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.467
right where I'm sitting,
is the exact spot

12:14.501 --> 12:18.705
that I realized: I should
have less salt in my diet.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.942
I should have less salt
in my diet.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.244
That's beautiful, man.
Stay healthy, baby.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.646
-Good memories.
-Oh, my God.

12:26.679 --> 12:30.283
This is the spot, where, for
the weirdest minute of my life,

12:30.317 --> 12:32.719
I was super attracted
to Winston.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.387
-No.
-We've all been there.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.789
It was my swimmer's body.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.225
Ooh. Ooh, hey.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.627
Yeah, they got me on
bike duty today.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.462
My hammies need to get
into some jammies

12:42.495 --> 12:46.900
because they are rock-hard.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.635
-Yes.
-(sultry music plays)

12:48.668 --> 12:51.471
(echoes):
Oh, yeah. That's good stuff.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.474
You feel that?
You hear that? Yeah.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.643
-Oh! -No!
-No!

12:56.676 --> 12:58.045
Oh, it went away pretty quick.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.147
(shrieks)

13:00.180 --> 13:01.982
I tore my anus.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.651
I tore my anus. Oh.

13:04.684 --> 13:08.188
I was sitting right here when
I first introduced you guys

13:08.221 --> 13:10.357
to my hilarious baby voice.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.327
Uh-oh, look who just woke up.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.864
(high-pitched):
I'm a baby.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.866
I'm a baby

13:18.899 --> 13:21.501
and I need my milkie.
Where's my ba-ba?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.503
-What are you doing?
-Put that baby away.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.672
Babies can't talk.
It's inherently flawed.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.674
And that's where I met you
for the first time.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.442
-Aw. -I remember you said
that was one of your

13:29.476 --> 13:30.878
top five boners of all time.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.712
Do you remember
you used to rank them?

13:32.745 --> 13:35.548
-Be quiet.
-It's just foot lotion.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.188
And right over there
is where Cece and I

13:41.221 --> 13:42.655
had our first mess around.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.857
What? Don't tell them.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.292
It's time for the mess around

13:45.325 --> 13:47.060
to become the confess around.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.529
-* Ain't nobody *
-* Nobody *

13:49.562 --> 13:51.464
-* Loves me better *
-* Loves me better *

13:51.498 --> 13:53.633
-* Makes me happy *
-(wood cracks)

13:53.666 --> 13:56.703
-* Makes me feel this way *
-* Nobody *

13:56.736 --> 13:58.005
-* Ain't nobody *
-* Ain't nobody. *

13:58.038 --> 13:59.039
Wait, wait, wait.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.876
Is that a paper plate
covered with brown marker

14:02.910 --> 14:04.811
-to look like floor?
-Yeah. -That's what that is.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.379
-Yeah, yeah.
-Cece?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.049
-Hmm? -If you weren't wearing
those dumb-ass shoes,

14:09.082 --> 14:12.852
and I hadn't just gotten that
new dope Chaka Khan CD-ROM...

14:12.886 --> 14:15.889
-It was dope as hell. -You would
not have become my girl.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.058
-Babe.
-Babe. Don't.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.894
-Babe.
-Babe. You better stop.

14:20.928 --> 14:24.364
-Babe. Babe.
-Mmm. Mm-mmm.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.665
No. I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna cry.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.068
There' no point. Nobody said
nothing about no crying.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.070
-That's not what this is.
-No, no crying.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.905
(exhales deeply)

14:31.939 --> 14:33.440
Wait. Where is Nick?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.575
Clearly, he doesn't like
all of this emotion.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.277
He doesn't have a heart
in that butter tub

14:37.310 --> 14:39.112
he calls a body anyway.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.282
-He doesn't care about spots.
-NICK: I'm in here!

14:46.219 --> 14:49.256
You think I don't got spots?
I got spots.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.291
"Have." Have spots.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.360
Sorry. Go, keep go...

14:53.393 --> 14:55.028
This spot right here is where
my best friend Schmidt and I

14:55.062 --> 14:56.463
moved a couch in.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.398
That happened in
the living room, Nick.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.899
I know, I just don't want
to get up.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.768
You got it? You got it?

15:01.801 --> 15:03.270
I got it. I'm good,
I'm good, I'm cool.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.571
-(grunts)
-I got it.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.940
Houston, we got an "I got it."

15:06.974 --> 15:09.042
(grunts)

15:09.076 --> 15:11.444
Sheesh.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.213
Sitting pretty close
to each other,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.781
-don't you think?
-Oh, sorry.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.450
Thanks.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.986
Lot of cool stuff's gonna happen
in this loft, huh?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.787
You're telling me, man.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.722
What do you think's
gonna happen here in the next...

15:22.755 --> 15:24.124
chunk of our lives?

15:24.157 --> 15:26.293
I don't know.
I meet a nice lady.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.795
She wants to have a baby
with me.

15:28.828 --> 15:29.963
What does she look like?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.131
-Sexy.
-(laughs)

15:31.164 --> 15:33.066
Keep going. Right off the jack.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.834
Just, like, you know,
like, shows up,

15:34.867 --> 15:36.069
but, like, casually.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.304
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.305
Like, wearing a beanie

15:38.338 --> 15:39.339
and, like, a little hoodie.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.640
You know what I mean?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.442
Like, sort of, like,
an orangish-red hoodie.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.311
(chuckles)

15:48.281 --> 15:50.950
Anyway, man,
I just wanted to say, uh...

15:52.152 --> 15:53.420
Oh.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.455
...all thanks.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.190
I'm done.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.791
Well, it's just lotion.
It ain't gonna hurt you, now.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.160
(chuckles) Yeah, go ahead.
Slap it in there.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.797
Wow, it's so frickin' creamy.

16:04.831 --> 16:05.965
This is what
I've been telling you.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.301
It's really cool.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.870
-It actually kind of feels nice.
-(Jess chuckles)

16:10.903 --> 16:13.606
I mean, I got to say,
I really like foot lotion.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.641
Thank you.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.675
They should make
more foot lotion

16:15.708 --> 16:16.709
for your hand.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.844
Foot lotion hand.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.180
Or... foot-lotion hand.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.448
I don't know.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.815
You should use this for elbows.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.452
You should use lotion
for dry parts of your skin.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.686
(chuckles)

16:27.687 --> 16:28.721
It's really creamy.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.057
For the first time in my life,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.791
I realize my feet
could be more than weapons.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.027
I love you, man.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.863
Oh, yeah, that's...

16:36.896 --> 16:38.731
Well, yeah, man. I, uh...

16:38.765 --> 16:40.200
(whispering):
Is he gonna finally say it?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.834
Guys, don't-don't put
any pressure on him.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.403
No, what? Dude, you're not
putting pressure on me.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.072
-It's something I want to say.
-You don't have to say it.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.539
I don't need to say anything.
I want to say it.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.808
-You never said it before.
-I love you, man.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.477
-Yes! -(laughs)
-Are you kidding me right now?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.579
-Go, Nick!
-Are you kidding me?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.247
-I love you, man. We're buddies.
-JESS: Yes!

16:54.281 --> 16:55.315
CECE:
Really?

16:55.348 --> 16:58.585
Oh, my feet are so creamy.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.852
You were right.
This is what it means

16:59.886 --> 17:01.020
to have soft feet, buddy.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.755
Well, I feel good.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.891
I'm ready to say good-bye to 4D.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.259
No, not yet.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.195
W-We've done everything.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.198
There's one more thing.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.002
JFK!

17:16.035 --> 17:17.370
-FDR!
-FDR! -FDR!

17:18.605 --> 17:20.373
-FDR!
-(all cheer)

17:23.210 --> 17:25.845
-Wait for me. I over-lotioned.
-Okay, for the last time,

17:25.878 --> 17:27.514
the game is True American.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.117
-We know the rules.
-We know one rule.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.418
ALL:
The floor is lava!

17:31.451 --> 17:33.120
Tonight we play the game
with a twist.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.221
It's True American:

17:34.254 --> 17:35.788
Packing Edition.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.790
You land on something,
you pack it.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.093
-Shotgun tip-off!
-Oh!

17:41.161 --> 17:43.596
54-40 or fight! Whoa!

17:44.331 --> 17:45.298
(Winston whoops)

17:45.332 --> 17:47.200
You go, boy!

17:47.234 --> 17:48.801
(whoops)

17:48.835 --> 17:50.870
The middle class
is disappearing!

17:50.903 --> 17:52.739
BOTH (chanting):
Mama, where's my pa?

17:52.772 --> 17:53.973
He's in the White House.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.242
Ha, ha, ha!

17:55.275 --> 17:56.909
WINSTON:
I know a fine brothel

17:56.943 --> 17:58.278
right to the left. Yah!

17:58.311 --> 18:00.113
Westward ho.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.081
We're coming for your gold.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.751
Almost to Utah, Uncle Brother.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.486
I like the look of that ox.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.720
SCHMIDT:
Nailed it.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.589
Manifest destiny.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.491
(all cheering)

18:15.995 --> 18:17.830
-* Remember all the drives... *
-Oh, yeah!

18:17.864 --> 18:19.466
You got to drink
another root beer.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.901
-* To the cloudy mountainsides *
-Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:21.934 --> 18:24.971
* And we'll never starve
to death... *

18:25.004 --> 18:27.307
Chug, chug. Ruth,
prohibition has been lifted.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.975
All right. Ready, Moses?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.677
SCHMIDT: Drink, Moses.
Drink, Moses. Come on!

18:30.710 --> 18:35.315
(children laughing)

18:35.348 --> 18:37.083
What are you not understanding?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.651
You're all burning
in lava right now.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.153
Oklahoma Land Grab!

18:40.187 --> 18:42.155
Sooners, stake your claim!

18:42.189 --> 18:43.423
Come on!

18:43.456 --> 18:47.327
* But if I ever
feel the same again *

18:47.360 --> 18:49.696
* Ah, ah, ah *

18:51.531 --> 18:54.367
* Ah, ah, oh... *

18:59.339 --> 19:00.707
You ready?

19:00.740 --> 19:01.974
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.743
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.114
NICK:
Not my first eviction.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.183
-Won't be my last.
-Two, one.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.654
WINSTON:
Gotcha!

19:14.687 --> 19:16.623
(Winston laughs)

19:16.656 --> 19:19.392
Prank Sinatra, baby!

19:19.426 --> 19:20.427
What?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.196
I don't get it.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.697
The truck is the prank?

19:24.731 --> 19:26.165
What, did you pay
the rental fee?

19:26.199 --> 19:28.000
Winston, that's just nice.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.303
You didn't have to move.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.205
Yes, we did have to move,
you idiot.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.873
-We got evicted.
-What is he talking about?

19:33.906 --> 19:35.174
NICK:
I have no idea.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.176
WINSTON:
Engram Pattersky.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.011
If you rearrange those letters,

19:39.045 --> 19:41.180
what does it spell?

19:41.214 --> 19:43.015
"My greatest prank."

19:43.049 --> 19:44.384
My greatest prank!

19:44.417 --> 19:45.985
-No.
-CECE: Are you kidding me?

19:46.018 --> 19:49.722
-(Winston chuckles)
-Wait, are you Engram Pattersky?

19:49.756 --> 19:51.324
Winston, you were in the loft

19:51.358 --> 19:54.026
when all of the notices
slid under the door.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.695
I had some help.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.165
Thanks for the wedding invite.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.868
I work at that hospital.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.571
BOTH:
One, two, three,

20:04.604 --> 20:05.605
slide.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.174
Winston was right.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.243
This was a two-man job.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.744
Hell yeah.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.780
But I checked.
Everyone's getting evicted.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.082
They're turning it into
a non-residential space.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.584
Oh, who did you check with?

20:17.617 --> 20:20.553
I hope it was someone important.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.590
Sorry, Jess. Nothing I can do

20:23.623 --> 20:25.792
about zoning laws.
My hands are tied.

20:25.825 --> 20:26.793
(whispers):
Write the check.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.195
Oh. Uh-huh.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.530
Add a zero.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.931
Yeah, okay.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.232
What?!

20:33.266 --> 20:35.201
We didn't have to move?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.569
Hell no!

20:36.603 --> 20:38.104
You didn't have to move.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.406
When did you have time

20:39.439 --> 20:41.641
to do all this?
You have a baby.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.975
Well, I got two babies:

20:43.009 --> 20:44.744
Dan Bill and this prank.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.779
This is a really stupid thing
you did.

20:46.813 --> 20:47.947
You should see your face.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.215
This is what you look like.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.950
(laughs)

20:50.983 --> 20:52.385
(imitating Jess):
"What?"

20:52.419 --> 20:54.554
(laughing):
Y'all look so dumb.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.088
Look at you, Nick.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.758
This is you, Nick.
(grunts)

21:02.795 --> 21:04.797
(shrieking)

21:13.105 --> 21:15.342
Okay, it's done.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.976
Everybody in the truck.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.345
Let's go. We're leaving.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.846
I mean, it's happening now
anyway.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.314
Impressive, man.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.782
-That was good.
-You know, I spent six months

21:22.815 --> 21:24.451
building
the Engram Pattersky website.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.453
And you guys
didn't even visit the office.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.954
-What's happening, y'all?
-What's up?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.756
* For one more try *

21:29.789 --> 21:31.290
WINSTON:
So, was the prank too small?

21:31.324 --> 21:32.859
You know, I've been guilty
of that in the past.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.127
SCHMIDT:
Too big, man. Way too big.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.763
JESS:
I don't know.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.832
-I think it was just right.
-ALL: Too big.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.300
-SCHMIDT: Definitely too big.
-CECE: Way too big.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.536
NICK:
Ridiculous.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.505
* Ooh *

21:45.538 --> 21:49.208
* Ooh, hoo, hoo *

21:49.241 --> 21:51.878
