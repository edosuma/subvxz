00:38.799 --> 00:40.320
(The Fang and Da gangs)

00:42.320 --> 00:45.039
(are a collection of street thugs.)

00:47.119 --> 00:49.119
(The Fang gang specializes in fraud)

00:49.280 --> 00:51.280
(and extortion.)

00:53.000 --> 00:53.880
(The Da gang)

00:54.840 --> 00:56.640
(collects debts,)

00:57.479 --> 00:58.240
(kidnaps people)

00:59.119 --> 01:00.479
(and runs casinos secretly.)

01:03.640 --> 01:04.719
(They're the first resort)

01:06.040 --> 01:08.359
(when the bailiffs are
investigating a case.)

01:10.439 --> 01:12.519
(No one knows the unspeakable things)

01:13.519 --> 01:15.680
(happening around better than they do.)

01:19.680 --> 01:21.760
(There are five gangs in Du County)

01:22.280 --> 01:23.120
(nicknamed)

01:23.719 --> 01:24.840
(the Two Rats and Three Wolves.)

01:25.559 --> 01:29.400
(Bath)

01:29.400 --> 01:30.159
(But)

01:31.079 --> 01:32.799
(they refer to themselves as)

01:33.879 --> 01:34.959
(the Five Lords.)

01:37.079 --> 01:39.599
(Their dealings require
the backing of officials.)

01:40.879 --> 01:43.319
(Formerly, their backing in Du County)

01:45.359 --> 01:46.239
(was Master.)

01:55.159 --> 01:55.760
Come on.

01:56.599 --> 01:57.680
Cheers.

03:05.510 --> 03:09.536
=Ripe Town=
=Episode 2=

03:22.360 --> 03:23.719
You ran into me on purpose.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.000
It wasn't me.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.360
It was you who ran into me.

03:26.759 --> 03:28.000
You even blame it on me?

03:28.960 --> 03:30.280
You know how much it is?

03:30.639 --> 03:32.639
This wine is aged 20.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.719
It's a gift prepared by my master.

03:34.719 --> 03:35.479
I'm very sorry.

03:35.479 --> 03:36.520
Sorry?

03:36.520 --> 03:38.199
You think an apology is enough?

03:41.680 --> 03:42.280
You...

03:43.199 --> 03:44.319
This is blackmail.

03:44.319 --> 03:45.199
Blackmail?

03:46.520 --> 03:47.360
Go to the Yamen

03:47.599 --> 03:49.199
and see if they will extort you.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.240
Is there anyone to be a witness?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.639
We're the witnesses.

03:55.879 --> 03:56.800
I saw it.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.000
This man wasn't watching his steps.

03:59.159 --> 04:00.039
He ran into you

04:00.319 --> 04:01.240
and broke the jar.

04:01.759 --> 04:02.439
Bro,

04:02.800 --> 04:04.719
this wine must be worth a lot, right?

04:04.879 --> 04:08.080
I just bought it from the Tianxing Shop
for five taels of silver.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.639
No need to explain.
Let's go to the Yamen.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.240
We're law-abiding.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.080
Cut it out. Go.

04:13.599 --> 04:14.240
Sir,

04:16.120 --> 04:18.279
I take the blame for the wine money.

04:21.839 --> 04:22.319
This...

04:22.319 --> 04:24.160
No, this money is not enough.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.240
Let's go to the Yamen

04:25.399 --> 04:26.720
to get a judgment.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.120
Go.

04:27.120 --> 04:27.560
Don't.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.319
Gentlemen.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.720
Hello, sir.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.120
Who are you?

04:35.439 --> 04:36.560
I am just a passer-by.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.879
I feel sorry for this old man,

04:38.879 --> 04:40.079
so I want to help him.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.040
To pay for him?

04:41.199 --> 04:41.759
Yes.

04:42.879 --> 04:43.800
Sir,

04:43.800 --> 04:44.759
you're so kind.

04:44.759 --> 04:46.120
No need for this.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.120
How much is it?

04:51.839 --> 04:52.680
To be honest,

04:53.399 --> 04:55.000
it's four taels and six fen,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.240
and over ten coins.

04:56.360 --> 04:56.959
Sir,

04:57.680 --> 04:59.439
just do me a favor

05:00.439 --> 05:01.560
and let him go.

05:11.439 --> 05:12.040
Fine.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.360
After all, I'm kind-hearted.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.120
I will make up for the rest myself.

05:20.040 --> 05:20.600
Old man,

05:21.759 --> 05:23.120
you've met a good person.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.000
Remember to repay the money.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.600
Yes.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.360
Sir, I will definitely repay this money.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.360
To reassure you,

05:31.360 --> 05:33.920
let's write an evidence of debt.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.079
Can you read?

05:35.560 --> 05:36.279
I can't read.

05:36.279 --> 05:38.639
But it's okay. You just write it down.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.439
I'll put my thumb.

05:39.759 --> 05:41.480
I am poor,

05:42.079 --> 05:43.879
but I never owe money to others.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.000
If so,

05:45.480 --> 05:47.120
I will write one.

05:47.920 --> 05:48.759
Scorpion Tiger.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.160
Sangeng.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.680
I've been watching you for a while.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.759
Same old trick again.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.319
What do you mean?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.000
Sangeng,

06:07.680 --> 06:09.160
how about having some tea?

06:11.040 --> 06:11.720
No rush.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.839
Liu Lao'er, right?

06:15.800 --> 06:17.560
Yes, sir.

06:17.839 --> 06:19.399
I am Liu Lao'er.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.199
Who else is in your family?

06:21.560 --> 06:22.600
My wife died early.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.519
My son and his wife died
because of the smallpox.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.800
Only my granddaughter
and I are left in the family.

06:30.439 --> 06:32.920
You're a lonely old man.
I thought as much.

06:33.439 --> 06:36.160
What do you mean by this, sir?

06:36.600 --> 06:37.920
What property do you have?

06:39.240 --> 06:41.040
What can a poor family have?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.480
Just three straw rooms,

06:42.639 --> 06:43.600
a lotus field,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.000
and a paddy field.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.199
How old is the kid?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.079
She just turned 13.

06:50.959 --> 06:51.680
Liu Lao'er,

06:52.959 --> 06:54.240
these men must have had

06:55.240 --> 06:57.079
their eyes on you for a while.

07:00.240 --> 07:00.959
Don't move.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.079
Who are you?

07:09.319 --> 07:10.600
You look strange.

07:10.959 --> 07:11.759
Sangeng,

07:12.680 --> 07:14.079
he's new here.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.639
Come now

07:16.639 --> 07:18.160
and pay your respects to him.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.879
Sangeng.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.160
Liu Lao'er,

07:29.319 --> 07:31.360
if you sign
an evidence of debt with him,

07:32.079 --> 07:34.439
the interest will be calculated by day.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.199
As interest compounds,

07:36.199 --> 07:38.000
in less than a month, your house,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.519
lotus pond and paddy field
will all belong to him,

07:41.399 --> 07:42.759
and this is not the end.

07:42.759 --> 07:44.639
What's most valuable to them

07:46.399 --> 07:47.360
is your granddaughter.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.800
Sangeng,

07:50.199 --> 07:51.399
what are you doing?

07:51.399 --> 07:53.040
I'm going to ruin your business.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.439
My master specifically told you

07:57.720 --> 07:59.199
not to target children.

08:01.079 --> 08:01.839
Captain Leng...

08:03.560 --> 08:05.079
He did make rules,

08:05.079 --> 08:06.240
but he is already dead.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.160
So you think

08:09.800 --> 08:11.120
the rules are gone now?

08:15.279 --> 08:18.000
I heard that Captain Leng

08:18.959 --> 08:20.800
made a lot of rules for you.

08:23.439 --> 08:25.759
You must have your own rules, right?

08:26.319 --> 08:26.920
I...

08:28.639 --> 08:29.920
I don't care about that.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.000
So not many rules.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.840
But since I

08:39.840 --> 08:42.279
took over his position,

08:42.720 --> 08:45.440
I'll have to trouble you in the future.

08:45.799 --> 08:46.919
I hope

08:47.240 --> 08:48.320
when the time comes,

08:48.480 --> 08:50.759
you'll do me a favor, alright?

08:53.519 --> 08:54.279
Captain Yi,

08:55.279 --> 08:56.879
I only have one thing to say.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.159
What is it?

08:59.240 --> 09:00.679
We show our respect,

09:02.039 --> 09:03.080
and you reciprocate.

09:04.080 --> 09:04.879
Then,

09:06.039 --> 09:07.600
I will reciprocate a lot

09:07.720 --> 09:08.399
if you show

09:08.799 --> 09:09.559
enough respect.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.159
Good, Captain Yi.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.519
You're good too.

09:21.080 --> 09:21.679
Cheers.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.759
Sangeng,

09:28.919 --> 09:31.799
did you specially come
to break our business again today?

09:32.240 --> 09:33.799
It was just incidental.

09:33.799 --> 09:35.200
I came to see your master.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.320
He is not here.

09:39.120 --> 09:39.879
Again?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.960
I've been here several times.

09:43.039 --> 09:45.000
Okay. How about this?

09:45.639 --> 09:46.799
Inform me at the Yamen

09:46.799 --> 09:48.200
when your master is back.

09:48.399 --> 09:50.320
You have to tell your master clearly

09:50.320 --> 09:51.840
to wait for me here.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.440
This task is yours now.

09:54.559 --> 09:55.720
Sangeng,

09:56.919 --> 09:58.759
you're making things hard for me.

09:58.759 --> 10:00.360
How can it cause you trouble?

10:00.360 --> 10:03.600
Isn't your business
all about wandering around every day?

10:03.600 --> 10:04.240
No.

10:07.960 --> 10:08.679
Sangeng,

10:12.159 --> 10:14.399
the Five Lords are five people.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.159
You mustn't have only come to us, right?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.639
My master mustn't be

10:29.480 --> 10:31.279
the only one you failed to meet.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.480
So you're all in on it.

10:37.879 --> 10:40.519
Your masters all pretend to be gone.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.080
Sangeng,

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
some things

10:44.519 --> 10:45.679
are better

10:45.879 --> 10:47.639
left unsaid.

11:07.159 --> 11:07.840
Sangeng,

11:08.480 --> 11:09.519
anything else?

11:10.440 --> 11:12.039
Pass on a message for me, okay?

11:12.200 --> 11:12.799
Okay.

11:13.360 --> 11:13.919
Go ahead.

11:13.919 --> 11:16.080
Yesterday we caught a prostitute.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.679
She must be over 60 years old,

11:17.679 --> 11:19.480
but she still has clients.

11:20.039 --> 11:22.559
Tell your master
to pick her up from the Yamen.

11:22.559 --> 11:23.200
Prostitute?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.080
Sangeng,

11:25.320 --> 11:27.799
we don't do business of prostitutes.

11:27.799 --> 11:29.039
The old prostitute said

11:29.039 --> 11:30.840
your master was her son.

11:36.346 --> 11:37.440
(Bath)

11:37.440 --> 11:38.080
Captain Yi,

11:38.279 --> 11:41.159
do those gangsters usually gather
in this bathhouse?

11:41.320 --> 11:42.919
It's their rule.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.879
Everyone's naked,

11:44.879 --> 11:46.519
so no one can hide a knife.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.200
So hot.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.799
It's September but it's still scorching.

12:06.320 --> 12:06.960
Let's go.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.480
The Two Rats and Three Wolves

12:10.720 --> 12:12.440
have really turned to Captain Yi?

12:17.440 --> 12:18.679
Shicong, do you know

12:19.600 --> 12:23.360
our county's gangsters
are the poorest in our prefecture?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.080
Really?

12:25.519 --> 12:27.080
Our county is the richest.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.879
It's all because of my master.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.600
He set three bans for them.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.960
Do they follow his rules

12:34.480 --> 12:35.720
that much?

12:38.840 --> 12:39.519
What's wrong?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.360
Nothing. Go home.

12:58.039 --> 12:58.600
Mother.

12:59.919 --> 13:00.519
Sangeng,

13:01.279 --> 13:02.080
you're back.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.279
Mother,

13:03.600 --> 13:04.720
the lantern is out.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.360
Go in.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.080
Sangeng,

13:14.240 --> 13:15.799
your master's dead.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.399
You should probably
quit the job as a bailiff.

13:21.679 --> 13:22.240
Mother,

13:22.240 --> 13:23.919
what are you talking about?

13:24.360 --> 13:26.120
You're not fit for the job.

13:26.759 --> 13:27.399
Mother,

13:27.799 --> 13:29.399
there are good officers.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.320
Was your master a good person?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.159
Master,

13:41.919 --> 13:43.039
it was done.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.720
Mr. Cui gave ten taels.

13:47.679 --> 13:48.600
Sangeng,

13:48.879 --> 13:51.480
when I asked you to get money before,

13:51.639 --> 13:54.440
you always tried every means

13:54.559 --> 13:56.320
to avoid doing it.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.080
Why the sudden change of heart?

14:03.639 --> 14:04.480
Master,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.159
I was afraid if I didn't,

14:07.320 --> 14:08.679
you'd abandon me.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.879
I was the one

14:14.639 --> 14:16.720
who was afraid that you'd deny me.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.639
Master.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
Without you,

14:24.200 --> 14:25.399
I wouldn't get the job.

14:26.559 --> 14:28.000
I like being a bailiff.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.840
I like catching the bad guys.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.519
But Master,

14:34.639 --> 14:35.879
do I have to

14:37.000 --> 14:38.679
go against my conscience?

14:45.000 --> 14:45.840
Sangeng.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.240
Conscience is such a thing.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.200
If you want to sell it,

14:55.840 --> 14:57.320
it won't sell for much.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.360
But if you want to keep it,

15:00.720 --> 15:02.039
then it's expensive.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.080
I don't think

15:08.399 --> 15:10.120
you can afford the price.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.480
He was a good person.

15:16.559 --> 15:17.600
I only know

15:18.840 --> 15:20.600
he was a very powerful person.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.399
Such a powerful man
can't be a good person.

15:26.039 --> 15:28.919
A person this powerful
even lost his life.

15:29.639 --> 15:32.720
The murderer
must be more powerful than him.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.399
Mother.

15:33.759 --> 15:34.440
Sangeng,

15:35.039 --> 15:35.799
I know

15:35.799 --> 15:38.240
you'll avenge your master.

15:40.080 --> 15:40.960
I'm afraid.

15:42.519 --> 15:43.200
Mother,

15:44.919 --> 15:46.120
I am a bailiff.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.080
In this world,

15:51.480 --> 15:53.440
how can bailiffs be afraid of villains?

15:58.120 --> 16:01.080
I've been blind for three years.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.320
During the time,

16:04.639 --> 16:06.240
it seems like

16:07.240 --> 16:09.679
it's never dawned.

16:10.639 --> 16:12.120
Always in the deep night.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.120
The darkness

16:15.679 --> 16:17.440
always reminds me of your father.

16:18.639 --> 16:20.639
He always told us

16:20.639 --> 16:22.440
a watchman was an officer too.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.879
So he was looking out for thieves

16:23.879 --> 16:25.159
when he was on patrol.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.679
He never caught a thief,

16:26.799 --> 16:28.399
but he did put out a few fires.

16:29.200 --> 16:29.919
But

16:30.720 --> 16:31.639
in the end,

16:33.279 --> 16:36.159
he died saving people from a fire.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.679
My master said he was a good man.

16:42.559 --> 16:43.759
Back then,

16:44.600 --> 16:47.799
the whole lane was pitch-black,

16:48.840 --> 16:52.159
and it was your father
with his lantern who provided light.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.120
Sangeng,

16:54.360 --> 16:55.840
after your father died,

16:56.320 --> 16:58.039
you became my light.

17:01.519 --> 17:02.159
Mother,

17:03.399 --> 17:04.160
don't worry.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.480
I will

17:09.400 --> 17:10.720
shine brightly.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.319
Mr. Song.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.440
Extend your hand.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.319
Any idea what this is?

17:35.759 --> 17:36.759
This is a tooth.

17:37.319 --> 17:38.200
What tooth?

17:39.279 --> 17:41.119
I guess it's a molar.

17:41.359 --> 17:44.119
Do you know what's special

17:45.559 --> 17:46.559
about this molar?

17:50.559 --> 17:51.759
Look carefully.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.359
I truly don't know.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.680
A molar usually has three roots,

17:57.680 --> 17:59.720
but this one has four.

18:00.359 --> 18:01.640
I'll give it to you.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.000
Why?

18:04.519 --> 18:05.839
This tooth is quite rare.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.279
You're lucky.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.079
Thank you, Mr. Song.

18:12.079 --> 18:13.039
I'll take my leave.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.160
On that day, Captain Leng

18:18.200 --> 18:19.720
went to the Cuihua Tower, no?

18:22.319 --> 18:23.200
I don't know.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.160
Were Lin Siniang from that place

18:31.359 --> 18:33.839
and your master old lovers?

18:34.160 --> 18:36.319
I've never heard about it.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.160
This is really good.

18:44.319 --> 18:44.960
Sangeng.

18:45.079 --> 18:46.079
Keep it for me.

18:46.079 --> 18:46.599
Okay.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.319
Where were you?

18:48.319 --> 18:49.519
Captain Yi is looking for you.

18:50.759 --> 18:51.519
I'll go there.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.160
Don't go.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.400
Why?

18:56.839 --> 18:59.119
Today, Captain Yi has dispatched all

18:59.119 --> 19:00.319
of our on-duty members.

19:00.319 --> 19:01.839
I was also assigned a task.

19:01.839 --> 19:03.319
But I found something wrong

19:03.319 --> 19:04.359
and sneaked back.

19:04.759 --> 19:05.599
I guess

19:08.559 --> 19:10.079
he's going to deal with you.

19:10.759 --> 19:13.559
So, you should hide first.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.480
I'll get them back.

19:15.839 --> 19:19.079
At least wait until Jin comes back.
Then we go see him together.

19:19.079 --> 19:21.079
I can't hide forever.

19:22.519 --> 19:23.839
It's just a matter of time

19:25.119 --> 19:26.440
as long as I'm here.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.480
Alright, I'll go with you.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.799
I'll go alone.

19:32.359 --> 19:33.240
Don't get involved.

19:34.359 --> 19:35.920
Okay, then be careful.

19:43.079 --> 19:43.839
What are you doing?

19:45.480 --> 19:46.440
The watchhouse.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.799
It's the same way.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.480
Qu Sangeng,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.519
look at you now. You're in such a mess.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.119
You don't look like an officer at all.

20:08.759 --> 20:09.880
Where did you just go?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.000
I was called by Mr. Song.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.519
Mr. Song?

20:15.559 --> 20:16.640
Why did he do that?

20:17.480 --> 20:18.960
He gave me something.

20:25.359 --> 20:26.400
This is a...

20:26.400 --> 20:27.480
It's a tooth.

20:28.000 --> 20:28.720
A molar tooth.

20:29.319 --> 20:31.440
Usually a molar tooth has three roots.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.519
This one has four roots.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.880
Why did Mr. Song give you a tooth?

20:41.359 --> 20:42.599
He said no reason.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.400
Just it was rare,

20:44.400 --> 20:45.599
and I was lucky.

20:51.359 --> 20:53.160
Are you joking with me now?

20:55.119 --> 20:57.839
Who dares to make a joke
about Mr. Song in this Yamen?

20:58.119 --> 21:00.920
If you don't believe me,
you can ask him yourself.

21:08.119 --> 21:09.480
Let's not talk about it,

21:09.799 --> 21:11.240
but your job.

21:11.799 --> 21:13.279
Since you're a bailiff,

21:13.359 --> 21:14.960
your duty is to catch thieves.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.319
The case of the antique jade vase stolen

21:17.480 --> 21:19.480
from Mr. Cui's house.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.640
Still not solved yet?

21:20.920 --> 21:23.640
It was handled
by me and my master together.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.680
Your master again?

21:26.039 --> 21:27.240
Well, Qu Sangeng,

21:27.240 --> 21:30.480
are you planning to work
under his name in the future?

21:31.680 --> 21:32.400
I'll give you

21:32.799 --> 21:34.240
three days.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.119
If you can't solve it within three days,

21:37.559 --> 21:38.880
I'll dismiss you.

21:45.559 --> 21:46.359
Anything else?

21:48.559 --> 21:49.519
No need.

21:50.160 --> 21:50.880
What?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.680
The case

21:52.680 --> 21:54.799
was done by a tenant named Cui Shun.

21:56.920 --> 21:57.599
Tell me more.

21:58.519 --> 22:00.079
Mr. Cui likes antiques.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.119
Cui Shun's job is to help him
find antiques everywhere.

22:03.559 --> 22:05.000
The vase was obtained illegally

22:05.000 --> 22:06.799
from a grave robbery.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.880
With all the antiques in the room,

22:08.880 --> 22:10.319
only the jade vase was lost.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.400
Presumably,
the thief knew its origin and thought

22:13.599 --> 22:15.759
Mr. Cui wouldn't report it.

22:15.759 --> 22:17.240
But in Cui's house,

22:17.400 --> 22:20.559
apart from Cui Shun,
no one else knew about its origin.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.440
When we questioned him,

22:22.759 --> 22:25.000
he panicked and contradicted himself.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.799
I'll go to Cui's house to catch him

22:28.680 --> 22:29.839
for the vase tomorrow.

22:38.279 --> 22:39.039
Good.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.680
As for this case,

22:43.160 --> 22:45.000
I'll barely consider you've passed.

22:45.599 --> 22:46.279
That's all.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.880
Pick up your tooth.

22:48.319 --> 22:49.759
Do whatever you have to do.

22:52.200 --> 22:52.920
Wait.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.799
What else do you need?

23:02.279 --> 23:03.279
I'm not calling you.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.440
What's your name?

23:08.960 --> 23:09.839
Captain Yi,

23:09.839 --> 23:10.920
I'm Gao Shicong.

23:11.039 --> 23:12.000
Auxiliary bailiff?

23:12.000 --> 23:12.480
Yes.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.200
Show me your badge.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.640
Today is your last day.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.559
You're fired.

23:24.559 --> 23:25.240
Fired?

23:25.440 --> 23:26.200
Why?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.559
Do I need a reason

23:28.799 --> 23:30.519
to fire an auxiliary bailiff?

23:36.759 --> 23:37.359
Cheers.

23:41.759 --> 23:43.319
Isn't it just a job?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.359
It's not a big deal.

23:46.839 --> 23:47.480
Sangeng,

23:49.079 --> 23:51.079
you know my father is a butcher, right?

23:53.279 --> 23:55.960
I became an auxiliary bailiff

23:56.599 --> 23:58.839
just to avoid being a butcher like him.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
But now...

24:04.480 --> 24:05.440
Now what?

24:05.960 --> 24:06.680
Now,

24:07.960 --> 24:10.039
I'm eager to butcher pigs.

24:10.599 --> 24:11.559
Why?

24:13.599 --> 24:15.559
Every pig I butcher in the future

24:16.319 --> 24:17.839
is Yi to me.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.599
If my father hadn't died,

24:31.599 --> 24:35.079
I guess I would have been
on night watch with him now.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.759
But your master was Captain Leng.

24:40.759 --> 24:42.880
You were meant to be a bailiff.

24:43.599 --> 24:44.559
Back in the day,

24:45.480 --> 24:47.680
Yi was so afraid of Captain Leng.

24:48.519 --> 24:49.960
But he took it over

24:50.680 --> 24:52.480
right after Captain Leng's death.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.920
A bunch of rats.

24:55.559 --> 24:56.480
They should die.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.480
Butchering pigs requires stability.

25:00.359 --> 25:02.319
Cut it open for bleeding.

25:02.880 --> 25:03.480
Correct.

25:04.119 --> 25:07.319
Then blow air into the cut,

25:08.519 --> 25:10.359
so it's easier to skin it.

25:11.599 --> 25:12.119
Correct.

25:28.119 --> 25:28.759
Sangeng,

25:28.759 --> 25:29.720
stop hitting him.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.079
You dare to tail me.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.200
I didn't tail you.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.400
I just came to buy wine.

25:34.839 --> 25:35.519
To buy wine?

25:35.920 --> 25:36.839
Of all the pubs,

25:36.839 --> 25:39.839
why did you have to come to this one?

25:40.160 --> 25:41.720
Sangeng, it's really

25:41.720 --> 25:42.680
a misunderstanding.

25:44.359 --> 25:45.319
You rat.

25:45.519 --> 25:47.160
I'll slaughter you today.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.480
Sangeng, don't.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.519
Get away.

25:53.759 --> 25:54.400
Make way.

26:23.960 --> 26:24.640
Sangeng.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.680
Haven't you seen a bailiff

26:44.079 --> 26:45.119
working before?

26:56.839 --> 26:58.799
Sangeng, this is...

26:59.440 --> 27:00.279
Who are you?

27:02.240 --> 27:03.200
A scholar.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.599
Qian Mo.

27:06.599 --> 27:07.400
Qian Mo.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.880
Qian Mo.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.279
What's the charge?

27:11.200 --> 27:12.880
Provoking troubles

27:14.519 --> 27:15.799
and resisting arrest.

27:16.759 --> 27:18.640
(Provoking troubles
and resisting arrest.)

27:18.920 --> 27:19.559
Any problem?

27:25.519 --> 27:26.319
Come with me.

27:52.319 --> 27:56.200
You now look like a bailiff.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.359
Master.

28:11.279 --> 28:12.039
Sangeng,

28:14.559 --> 28:17.319
it's a long way to go.

28:27.599 --> 28:28.400
Master,

28:30.079 --> 28:32.319
why did you really die?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.079
Were you in someone's way to wealth

28:36.559 --> 28:37.160
or

28:43.880 --> 28:45.799
did you do something unjust?

28:48.200 --> 28:51.000
If it were the latter,

28:53.960 --> 28:56.160
would you renounce me as your master?

29:01.480 --> 29:04.000
You're always my master.

29:08.839 --> 29:14.359
But you're a good man.

29:16.759 --> 29:23.119
You're a good bailiff, right?

29:37.119 --> 29:38.000
It is out.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.519
I know this route well.

29:40.519 --> 29:41.519
No need for light.

29:45.519 --> 29:46.200
No.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.119
It must be lit.

29:48.839 --> 29:49.839
No need.

29:52.880 --> 29:53.799
Let me do it.

29:54.519 --> 29:55.240
Let me...

29:58.599 --> 29:59.759
There's no candle?

30:01.799 --> 30:03.200
Why didn't you place one?

30:04.759 --> 30:05.799
Well.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.920
I know this route well.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.599
I was planning to place a candle

30:10.599 --> 30:12.039
after turning that corner.

30:12.039 --> 30:13.160
Do you know me?

30:14.759 --> 30:16.200
Y-Y-Your face is familiar.

30:16.599 --> 30:17.799
Look carefully.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.279
I'm in the Hunter Squad.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.359
I know your headman, Chen Shiba.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.559
Tell me the truth.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.240
What are you doing?

30:42.079 --> 30:43.160
Well.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.000
I-I-I beg your mercy.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.480
Please don't tell my boss,

30:46.480 --> 30:47.920
or I will lose my job.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.480
Please be merciful.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.680
P-P-Please.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.720
Be merciful.

30:52.000 --> 30:52.759
I beg you.

30:54.799 --> 30:55.480
I beg you.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.799
You exchanged candles for money?

30:58.799 --> 31:01.119
I-I-I have many children.

31:01.240 --> 31:02.200
We're poor.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.200
P-P-Please.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.599
Please let me go.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.279
Please show some mercy

31:06.279 --> 31:07.599
and let me go.

31:09.119 --> 31:10.279
It's so dark tonight.

31:11.359 --> 31:12.359
With no light,

31:13.400 --> 31:14.839
what if you trip?

31:17.720 --> 31:19.319
I'm not the only one.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.240
Everybody does this.

31:22.839 --> 31:23.759
I'm used to it.

31:34.079 --> 31:36.640
Hey, there are no customers yet.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.079
Wait till more people come.

31:40.119 --> 31:41.799
Why should I wait until that?

31:43.200 --> 31:45.200
You're not a singer?

31:57.279 --> 31:57.960
Master,

31:58.920 --> 31:59.920
let me fill it up.

32:05.279 --> 32:06.240
Gui'er.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.680
I went to the Yamen for you.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.359
They said you didn't go.

32:11.359 --> 32:12.039
No,

32:13.160 --> 32:14.559
I didn't go today.

32:16.079 --> 32:16.640
I...

32:19.000 --> 32:19.960
Gui'er,

32:20.960 --> 32:23.400
how could you come here
as a young lady?

32:23.559 --> 32:24.519
Should you be here

32:24.799 --> 32:26.400
as a bailiff?

32:38.680 --> 32:39.400
Gui'er.

32:47.079 --> 32:47.720
My hat.

33:01.119 --> 33:01.920
Gui'er.

33:08.759 --> 33:09.680
Gui'er.

33:10.319 --> 33:11.200
Come in.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.920
Are you sober?

33:33.000 --> 33:33.960
Just wait here.

33:34.319 --> 33:35.680
I'll get my father's clothes for you.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.359
Sangeng,

33:45.079 --> 33:45.920
does it fit?

33:48.880 --> 33:49.480
It's okay.

33:50.839 --> 33:51.960
Then just wear it.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.240
My father wouldn't mind

33:54.480 --> 33:55.799
you wearing his clothes.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.400
Gui'er,

34:00.680 --> 34:01.200
I'm not...

34:01.200 --> 34:03.279
Did you encounter any difficulties?

34:05.960 --> 34:08.199
Let my father help you.

34:16.519 --> 34:17.320
Sangeng,

34:17.840 --> 34:19.440
do you remember this cellar?

34:19.440 --> 34:20.360
Of course I do.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.719
Didn't we use
to spend lots of time here?

34:26.559 --> 34:27.840
Do you remember this?

34:28.960 --> 34:29.599
Yeah.

34:30.519 --> 34:31.920
Ever since I can remember,

34:32.199 --> 34:33.880
this coffin has always been here.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.199
I felt strange, thinking

34:36.039 --> 34:38.440
only old people
would prepare it in advance.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.119
My master said it was uncertain

34:41.519 --> 34:44.119
when an accident
might occur to a bailiff.

34:44.119 --> 34:45.440
But this coffin

34:46.079 --> 34:47.000
can't be used.

34:47.519 --> 34:48.360
Why?

34:49.159 --> 34:50.000
Sangeng,

34:50.760 --> 34:52.360
open this coffin lid.

35:05.760 --> 35:06.679
I counted.

35:06.679 --> 35:07.559
10,000 taels.

35:07.559 --> 35:08.880
He didn't tell anyone,

35:08.880 --> 35:10.000
not even my mother.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.519
Our family is not wealthy

35:12.760 --> 35:14.159
but not poor.

35:14.559 --> 35:16.119
We have fields outside the city.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.159
But with his salary as a bailiff,

35:18.159 --> 35:20.159
it's impossible to have this much money.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.880
Master had been a bailiff
for so many years.

35:24.840 --> 35:28.480
Everyone in this county respected him.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.519
He got gifts,

35:30.079 --> 35:32.079
and over the years, he saved this up.

35:32.079 --> 35:32.480
It's...

35:32.480 --> 35:33.719
I'm not an officer,

35:34.320 --> 35:36.360
but I'm not so clueless.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.960
How many years would it
take him to save this much?

35:38.960 --> 35:41.119
Moreover, he didn't save all this money.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.320
Not by saving?

35:44.760 --> 35:46.960
These silver bars are all stamped.

35:47.159 --> 35:49.880
These were all cast in one batch.

35:56.360 --> 35:56.960
Gui'er,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.199
what do you suspect?

36:04.840 --> 36:06.119
People die for money.

36:07.159 --> 36:08.360
In the Yamen,

36:09.960 --> 36:11.679
not a single person is clean.

36:11.679 --> 36:12.719
But Master

36:13.760 --> 36:15.039
was not like them.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.119
I don't care if he was clean or dirty.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.440
No matter what, he was my father.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.920
He might be once responsible

36:27.320 --> 36:29.599
for a big wrongful case.

36:33.639 --> 36:34.800
There's something else.

36:55.039 --> 36:56.239
It was just after 1 a.m.

36:57.679 --> 36:59.280
The drum just sounded.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.599
The east yard
of Lu Residence caught fire.

37:01.599 --> 37:03.159
It was a west wind.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.159
Our west yard was affected.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.239
We got our neighbors' help,

37:07.480 --> 37:08.559
so it wasn't severe.

37:09.679 --> 37:10.440
Niu Lubao.

37:12.639 --> 37:14.719
September 7th, 1589.

37:18.519 --> 37:20.360
1589?

37:20.719 --> 37:22.400
These were all from 20 years ago.

37:23.159 --> 37:25.960
They were the neighbors' testimonies
after the fire.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.320
They are almost the same,

37:28.679 --> 37:30.079
except for the directions.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.639
Different yards were mentioned.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.119
It seems that Lu Residence
was very large.

37:34.559 --> 37:38.159
The house was on fire
on all sides at the same time?

37:42.199 --> 37:43.280
Prescriptions?

37:43.880 --> 37:45.800
They were from 20 years ago, too.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.920
They were given to two men,

37:48.559 --> 37:49.639
Chen Wang

37:49.639 --> 37:50.880
and Lu Yuanbao.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.519
The doctor was Cheng Yizhi.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.119
That genius doctor?

37:55.679 --> 37:56.719
I guess so.

38:04.679 --> 38:07.280
Master was meticulous
and always planned ahead.

38:07.880 --> 38:08.880
I'm afraid these are

38:09.519 --> 38:11.039
his life-saving chips.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.880
Are you saying these are evidence?

38:14.719 --> 38:15.559
10,000 taels.

38:17.159 --> 38:20.840
Who could come up with so much silver
is not an ordinary person.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.159
Did my father keep the evidence

38:24.599 --> 38:26.199
to restrain someone?

38:29.320 --> 38:30.159
So,

38:32.280 --> 38:33.360
could it be

38:36.599 --> 38:38.960
that my father was killed
by the one behind it?

38:42.039 --> 38:43.599
Now there is no way to know.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.119
Oh, right, Sangeng,

38:58.079 --> 38:59.480
you just mentioned the date.

39:00.119 --> 39:01.239
What are you thinking?

39:02.159 --> 39:03.199
That is

39:05.519 --> 39:06.960
the date of
my father's death anniversary.

39:15.239 --> 39:16.119
Gui'er,

39:16.639 --> 39:17.679
without my master,

39:18.159 --> 39:19.840
I wouldn't be who I am today.

39:20.559 --> 39:21.920
Whether he was good

39:22.840 --> 39:23.719
or bad,

39:26.880 --> 39:27.599
he was

39:30.760 --> 39:32.000
always my master.

39:35.239 --> 39:35.840
Mother,

39:36.679 --> 39:37.840
I have a question.

39:39.280 --> 39:39.920
Go ahead.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.239
Where was the fire my father put out?

39:44.079 --> 39:47.000
It was at Hehe Lane
near Tieshizi Street.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.159
A newcomer surnamed Lu.

39:49.159 --> 39:50.440
His whole family died.

39:52.519 --> 39:54.400
Why do you suddenly ask about it?

39:56.320 --> 39:59.119
Master still kept
the testimonies of that fire.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.320
Was that fire a major event

40:05.760 --> 40:07.159
to your master?

40:08.719 --> 40:10.280
He never mentioned it to me.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.679
But he kept the testimonies,

40:15.840 --> 40:17.760
so it was no ordinary matter to him.

40:20.039 --> 40:21.079
No wonder.

40:23.239 --> 40:23.840
Mother.

40:24.719 --> 40:25.679
No wonder what?

40:26.559 --> 40:29.719
I never heard your father mention before

40:30.320 --> 40:32.559
that he had any interaction
with your master.

40:33.679 --> 40:35.119
After your father died,

40:35.760 --> 40:37.039
he came several times.

40:38.039 --> 40:39.000
I thought at first

40:39.480 --> 40:44.079
he was just going through the motions
because he was in the Hunter Squad.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.039
Unexpectedly,

40:45.920 --> 40:47.239
he gave me a lot of money

40:47.559 --> 40:48.440
and told me

40:49.280 --> 40:52.079
he was your father's good friend.

40:57.639 --> 40:58.480
Niu Lubao.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.039
That's me.

41:00.039 --> 41:02.519
Do you remember
the fire of Lu Residence 20 years ago?

41:04.199 --> 41:05.000
Yes, I do.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.239
I do remember it.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.199
Sure. How can I not remember it?

41:10.199 --> 41:13.199
The Lu family was wealthy.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.159
It scared me so bad

41:15.320 --> 41:16.639
that my boobs were empty.

41:16.639 --> 41:19.400
Our second child was raised on soy milk.

41:19.679 --> 41:20.400
What?

41:20.480 --> 41:23.480
The big fire at Lu Residence
20 years ago!

41:23.840 --> 41:24.840
Fire?

41:26.280 --> 41:27.440
Where is it?

41:27.800 --> 41:29.360
That night, I couldn't sleep.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.599
I was angry with my wife.

41:33.119 --> 41:34.639
I can't remember the reason.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.199
It must be her nagging.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.480
My wife is such a chatterbox.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.199
Sir,

41:42.960 --> 41:43.719
are you married?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.880
I'm telling you.

41:48.119 --> 41:49.880
It's better to marry a mute.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.599
When did the fire start?

41:52.559 --> 41:53.400
Well.

41:53.639 --> 41:55.360
It was either 11 p.m or 1 a.m.

41:55.639 --> 41:56.760
I just heard

41:57.239 --> 41:58.519
the drum.

41:59.159 --> 42:01.639
Then suddenly...

42:02.320 --> 42:03.239
Guess what?

42:04.039 --> 42:04.559
What?

42:04.559 --> 42:06.599
A fireball fell from the sky.

42:07.239 --> 42:08.639
This fireball was floating

42:08.639 --> 42:09.599
and drifting

42:09.719 --> 42:11.320
on the roof of Lu's house.

42:11.719 --> 42:12.760
It started to roll.

42:13.079 --> 42:13.800
In an instant,

42:13.960 --> 42:16.440
the house turned into a sea of fire.

42:18.559 --> 42:20.599
I have your testimony from 20 years ago

42:20.599 --> 42:22.760
which does not mention any fireballs.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.880
I was busy with firefighting

42:27.480 --> 42:29.000
until dawn that night,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.079
so I might forget to mention it

42:31.079 --> 42:32.000
in confusion.

42:33.039 --> 42:34.320
I wasn't the only one.

42:34.679 --> 42:36.320
All our neighbors saw it.

42:37.079 --> 42:39.079
We often sit together and have a drink.

42:39.079 --> 42:41.000
When someone mentions the fireball,

42:41.599 --> 42:43.679
everyone says they saw it.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.000
(Fortuneteller Yue)
The fire was fierce,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.239
lasting until late the next morning.

42:49.639 --> 42:51.440
Until all was burned into ashes.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.559
My family hadn't fallen back then.

42:54.159 --> 42:55.800
I look poor now.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.519
My family was wealthy back then,

42:58.800 --> 43:01.440
and I was still a student
in county school.

43:02.440 --> 43:05.320
I was a schoolmate
of the young master of the Lu family.

43:05.719 --> 43:08.239
Fortunately, I met my master

43:08.239 --> 43:11.480
who taught me divination, geomancy,

43:11.480 --> 43:13.719
face-reading and fortune-telling skills.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.800
Sir, you have an unusual face.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.519
Do you want to get your future foretold?

43:23.519 --> 43:24.159
No.

43:30.280 --> 43:33.440
This is your testimony from 20 years ago

43:33.760 --> 43:36.199
about the fire at Lu Residence.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.119
Sir,

43:39.800 --> 43:41.440
I can't read.

43:46.159 --> 43:49.119
There's a rumor about the fire.

43:50.000 --> 43:50.800
What is it?

43:54.519 --> 43:56.440
It's said

43:56.440 --> 43:58.320
that the master of the family

43:58.320 --> 44:00.000
did something atrocious.

44:01.599 --> 44:04.119
A passing Taoist
accidentally learned about it

44:04.320 --> 44:05.679
and decided to do justice.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.679
The Taoist used
the Five Thunder Technique

44:08.880 --> 44:11.679
to summon thunder
to strike the master's bedroom,

44:11.960 --> 44:13.639
hence the big fire.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.440
Speaking of which,

44:17.800 --> 44:18.960
there is a rumor.

44:22.559 --> 44:23.480
What rumor?

44:25.199 --> 44:27.199
The master was a madman.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.320
The fire was set by him.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.760
Before that,

44:31.320 --> 44:34.440
he killed his brother.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.119
Are there any survivors
from the Lu family?

44:39.320 --> 44:40.039
No.

44:40.480 --> 44:42.159
Even all the servants died.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.960
I guess there's no one left
in the Lu family.

44:48.039 --> 44:48.960
Sir,

44:49.320 --> 44:50.719
the case

44:51.079 --> 44:52.800
has been closed by the Yamen.

44:53.199 --> 44:55.639
You can check it up.

44:57.320 --> 44:57.960
Please.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.559
Your mother's illness is caused

45:05.559 --> 45:07.920
by excessive grief which leads to lung,

45:07.920 --> 45:09.559
heart and liver damage.

45:10.039 --> 45:11.159
So it must take time.

45:11.159 --> 45:13.239
Let her take these three doses first

45:13.239 --> 45:14.039
and then observe her.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.800
Yes.

45:17.599 --> 45:18.480
Dr. Cheng.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.199
This is...

45:21.199 --> 45:22.519
He's my father's apprentice.

45:24.599 --> 45:26.079
My name is Qu Sangeng.

45:26.079 --> 45:27.519
I was just about to see you.

45:27.519 --> 45:28.400
For what?

45:29.519 --> 45:30.920
I have some prescriptions.

45:32.039 --> 45:33.519
I want you to check them out.

45:41.599 --> 45:44.719
These are the prescriptions I made.

45:46.159 --> 45:47.679
According to the time,

45:47.679 --> 45:49.199
they're from 20 years ago.

45:49.199 --> 45:51.039
So you're sure you made these?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.320
Yes, I am.

45:54.039 --> 45:55.119
So do you remember

45:55.119 --> 45:56.519
these two patients?

45:59.760 --> 46:02.320
Lu Yuanbao used to be a wealthy officer.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.360
This is not for a serious illness.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.440
Just for palpitation
and shortness of breath.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.039
Mainly nourishment.

46:08.679 --> 46:09.519
But Chen Wang.

46:09.519 --> 46:10.760
I don't remember him.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.280
But this prescription

46:14.079 --> 46:15.320
targets the liver-fire.

46:15.320 --> 46:16.719
Not really a major illness.

46:17.679 --> 46:20.039
20 years ago, Lu Residence
had a big fire.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.800
Do you know about it?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.440
It seems so.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.960
Where did you get

46:31.960 --> 46:33.800
the old prescriptions?

46:35.320 --> 46:36.760
I just happened to see them

46:36.760 --> 46:39.800
in a file folder in the Yamen
when looking into other things.

46:39.960 --> 46:40.800
I was curious.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
Strange then.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.800
I've been to the Yamen
to testify many times.

46:48.119 --> 46:50.280
If the prescriptions are evidence,

46:50.280 --> 46:52.280
then my testimony should be there.

46:52.679 --> 46:55.920
Did you find my testimony
in the documents?

46:57.920 --> 46:59.000
No.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.320
But it's been 20 years.

47:01.599 --> 47:04.239
It is possible
that some case documents are missing.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.199
I really can't recall

47:08.199 --> 47:10.320
the two patients' situation.

47:10.679 --> 47:13.000
After all, it was 20 years ago.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.199
I must have treated

47:14.199 --> 47:15.800
countless patients during the time.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.519
But

47:17.239 --> 47:19.119
the prescriptions are indeed mine,

47:19.119 --> 47:20.320
and they're correct.

47:20.760 --> 47:21.320
I...

47:21.960 --> 47:23.639
I wonder

47:24.800 --> 47:27.599
why you would bring up this old matter.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.159
Please don't take offense.

47:29.519 --> 47:31.079
It's not an urgent matter.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.000
I just wanted to ask you

47:33.000 --> 47:35.320
if you still remembered
the two patients.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.000
It is not about the prescriptions.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.519
If that's the case,

47:41.079 --> 47:42.480
I will take my leave.

47:42.679 --> 47:44.480
I've got other patients.

47:44.960 --> 47:45.559
Thank you.

47:45.559 --> 47:46.119
Thank you.

47:46.239 --> 47:47.639
Take your time with the medicine.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.280
Dr. Cheng was not telling the truth.

47:52.639 --> 47:54.239
He must know something.

47:56.679 --> 47:57.800
What does he know?

48:01.320 --> 48:02.079
Leng Rui,

48:02.320 --> 48:03.559
this pear is for Mother.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.000
There are too many.

48:05.000 --> 48:05.880
She can't eat them all.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.039
She should be the first to eat.

48:10.840 --> 48:11.519
Sangeng,

48:11.519 --> 48:12.519
I'll go get you one.

48:19.960 --> 48:20.639
Rui,

48:21.079 --> 48:22.320
how many have you eaten?

48:23.239 --> 48:24.239
I just ate one.

48:24.239 --> 48:25.000
No.

48:25.000 --> 48:25.960
I washed five.

48:25.960 --> 48:27.119
But there are only three now.

48:27.119 --> 48:28.199
You must have eaten two.

48:28.199 --> 48:29.719
No. I only ate one.

48:30.519 --> 48:31.599
Then the missing one?

48:33.199 --> 48:35.000
It must be Sangeng.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.920
I haven't even been in the room.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.519
It was you who ate it.

48:39.960 --> 48:41.559
Good for you, Leng Rui.

48:42.159 --> 48:43.920
Then it must be Dr. Cheng.

48:47.239 --> 48:47.920
Balderdash!

49:02.880 --> 49:03.519
Sangeng!

49:03.519 --> 49:04.679
Is Sangeng here?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.239
Is he here?

49:07.679 --> 49:08.280
Sangeng!

49:14.880 --> 49:15.559
Sangeng,

49:16.079 --> 49:16.840
Wulei School.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.239
Come with me.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.079
The students came this morning

49:27.719 --> 49:30.400
and found the door was locked.

49:31.519 --> 49:32.760
They knocked but no one responded.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.039
Later,

49:34.760 --> 49:36.880
my uncle's cook came but failed either.

49:38.079 --> 49:39.239
So, they summoned me.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.599
I climbed over the wall,

49:42.079 --> 49:43.079
and then I saw him.

49:45.760 --> 49:48.079
It still can't be sure
he is Mr. Wang, right?

49:48.679 --> 49:49.280
I'm sure.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.599
These shoes

49:51.480 --> 49:52.480
were made by my mother.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.760
This is a seal.

49:55.960 --> 49:59.000
My uncle loved
calligraphy and seal carving.

50:04.960 --> 50:09.519
He never used
this brass ferule on his students.

50:10.159 --> 50:11.320
Even when paddling them,

50:11.760 --> 50:13.639
he used a wood or bamboo one.

50:14.679 --> 50:15.679
This brass ferule

50:16.320 --> 50:18.000
was used to press down books.

50:22.119 --> 50:24.000
Young ones.

50:25.360 --> 50:26.239
Clad in attire

50:26.840 --> 50:27.840
in late spring.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.960
Grown

50:30.719 --> 50:31.920
and young ones.

50:32.920 --> 50:33.800
Bath in the Yi River,

50:34.880 --> 50:36.079
and the wind on the altar.

50:37.519 --> 50:38.320
Homeward with songs.

50:39.079 --> 50:40.000
What does it mean?

50:42.880 --> 50:43.800
In late spring,

50:44.880 --> 50:46.400
I wore the newly made clothes.

50:47.199 --> 50:49.519
Several adults and children

50:51.360 --> 50:52.760
bathed in the Yi River

50:53.760 --> 50:55.199
and enjoyed the wind on an altar.

50:56.599 --> 50:57.360
After that,

50:58.159 --> 50:58.960
we went home

50:59.639 --> 51:00.440
singing.

51:02.159 --> 51:02.960
Shovel.

51:09.280 --> 51:10.199
Go get a shovel.
