What is?

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:07.455
Well, I've been meaning to tell you this
for a while, but I slept with Katie.

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:11.361
Once. Long time ago.
Before you guys even knew each other.

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:14.057
- Slept with my wife?
- She wasn't. You didn't know her.

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:16.703
- You slept with my wife?
- It was a long time ago, man.

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:18.668
I never even slept with Lauren.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.305
- What?
- I never slept with Lauren!

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:28.043
No, I only let you think that, right?
Think that, to make you jealous.

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:31.378
- You never slept with Lauren?
- You slept with my wife!
