12:28.165 --> 12:29.332
How'd you wind up here, Amanda?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.043
I live in the building
where people got that disease

12:32.127 --> 12:33.128
they're talking about.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.424
Where are your folks?

12:37.507 --> 12:40.469
It's just me and Grandma. She was out.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.014
They're looking for her.
She's at the River Casinos.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.765
How old are you?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.226
I'll be 15 in January.

12:48.894 --> 12:49.895
Ninth grade?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.272
That's a tough year.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.356
Not for you, I bet.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.650
For anyone.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.322
All right, so, all of our victims
have come from

13:00.405 --> 13:02.282
one of two places, the CCU lab,

13:02.365 --> 13:03.742
or this apartment building.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.579
Then there's some mystery bug sprayer.
RUZEK: So, when was this?

13:07.662 --> 13:09.247
HALSTEAD: This was yesterday morning.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.625
Well, it definitely wasn't
Stuart Anderson, I mean...

13:11.708 --> 13:13.126
He was dying in his hospital bed.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.004
On top of that, the OCD techs
ran the source code

13:16.087 --> 13:18.715
behind the threatening messages
on the college server,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.550
Anderson's IP address was spoofed.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.719
Somebody made it look like
the threats came from Anderson.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.971
So, that's gotta be our offender.
He's covering his tracks.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.641
Hey, look, this guy
had access to the CCU lab.

13:27.724 --> 13:31.311
He steals the bacteria, then burns
the lab down to destroy any evidence.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.147
So, let's track where he bought
his bug spraying equipment,

13:34.231 --> 13:36.858
and I want a full run down
on South Fairfield.

13:36.942 --> 13:40.612
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch
before he infects more people.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.118
NATALIE: So, when we did
your initial intake, Amanda,

13:47.202 --> 13:49.871
we didn't find any cuts or bruises.
How are you feeling now?

13:49.955 --> 13:51.456
Okay.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.708
Any pain or numbness? Does anything hurt?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
No.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.712
All right, well I'm glad to hear that
because everything looks good.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.756
I'll be back to check on you
again later, okay?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.886
How about you, Hailey. how're you doing?

14:04.970 --> 14:07.514
I'm okay. How are you?
I should've asked you earlier.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.015
I heard you got knocked
on the head pretty bad.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.643
I'm doing fine, thanks. Okay.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.270
You guys hang in there, okay? Thanks.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.855
That was good news.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.857
Yeah, I guess.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.028
So, when did you know
you wanted to be a police officer?

14:27.784 --> 14:29.953
There was a sergeant,
her name's Trudy Platt.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.250
When I was 12, this guy
robbed my dad's restaurant,

14:35.333 --> 14:37.919
he pistol–whipped my dad,
stuck a gun in my face.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.672
And they took me down
to the police department,

14:40.755 --> 14:46.511
and I got to watch the most badass woman
in the world doing her thing.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.724
She commanded the room,
talked to officers and perps,

14:50.807 --> 14:53.977
both like she was the boss
of everything and everyone.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.104
And I wanted to be like her.

14:57.689 --> 14:58.690
And now you are.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.609
Not even close.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.153
But, I keep trying.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.697
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

15:06.364 --> 15:09.200
DANOVER: Make sure to swab
all handrails and doorknobs.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.662
Again, we are checking anywhere
people might put their hands.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.206
If this bug is more communicable
than other strains of staph,

15:15.290 --> 15:17.459
it could explain why so many people
are getting infected.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.002
Hold on, I just got word from my brother.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.047
They think someone may be spreading this
with a bug sprayer.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.548
ATWATER: Bug sprayer?

15:23.632 --> 15:25.091
Just found something in the furnace.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.357
Think you could take anything off that?

15:41.775 --> 15:42.776
Let's hope.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.655
This is no outbreak,
it's an act of terrorism.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.039
The bacteria in the nozzle,

15:56.122 --> 15:57.707
it's the same staph
we found in the victims.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.959
Okay.

16:00.835 --> 16:06.007
So, now we start combining antibiotics
to extend the spectrum of activity

16:06.091 --> 16:07.300
and stave off resistance.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.552
Now, if I remember my microbiology,

16:09.636 --> 16:12.847
some drugs attack the cell walls,
some the DNA inside.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.642
Therefore, we have to hit
the infection from multiple directions.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.894
Now, there's the Will
I remember from undergrad.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.399
Oh, my God.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.738
Whoa. It did not look like that
a few hours ago.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.534
I have never seen anything like this.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.996
It's reproducing so quickly.

16:37.914 --> 16:38.915
It's unbelievable.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.127
We need the people
from the university lab.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.295
Maybe, they'll have some idea
how to deal with this.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.800
Look, we still haven't
even ID'd the suspect,

16:48.883 --> 16:51.886
let alone found the connection
to 45 South Fairfield.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.140
So, I need to interview
the tenants of that building,

16:55.223 --> 16:56.599
and see if they know anything.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.685
Well, they're in quarantine.
And we can't release them

16:58.768 --> 17:01.813
until we're sure that
they haven't been infected,

17:01.896 --> 17:03.481
and that they're not contagious.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.233
So, I'll interview them in quarantine.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.777
A number of these people
are emotionally extremely fragile.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.612
I got one woman
who might even be psychotic.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.449
She's definitely suffering
from paranoid delusions.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.533
HANK: All right. Well, you're a doctor.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.118
Give 'em some drugs. Sedate 'em.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.078
I can't do that without their permission.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.872
There is someone out there
who targeted that building

17:18.955 --> 17:20.874
with weaponized bacteria.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.127
The key to why may well be
within that group.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.338
Now, you're telling me some
of these people are emotionally fragile.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.425
So, Dan, then come with me,

17:31.509 --> 17:32.802
keep 'em calm.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.471
But I have to talk to 'em.

17:38.683 --> 17:39.684
HANK: Upton.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.353
Hey, Sarge.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.148
Hailey, how you feel?

17:46.399 --> 17:47.400
Like I should be doing something.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.194
I can arrange that.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.242
Do you have any connection to the CCU lab
or know anyone in the building who might?

17:56.326 --> 17:57.702
No, I don't.

17:57.786 --> 18:01.164
Yesterday, did you see an exterminator,
a man spraying for bugs?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.751
Oh, for God's sakes, when are they gonna
let us out of this place?

18:04.834 --> 18:05.835
If you're asymptomatic,

18:05.919 --> 18:08.129
and your throat culture
comes back negative, you can leave.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.173
In the meantime,
I would really appreciate it

18:10.256 --> 18:12.217
if you'd try and answer
the detective's questions.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.301
(SIGHING)

18:15.428 --> 18:17.347
So, exterminator?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.058
Yeah, he was wearing this meth suit.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.684
Did you see where he was spraying?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.269
Down the hall.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.230
We have an ant problem,
so I thought that was why.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.482
Can you describe him? Race, height?

18:28.149 --> 18:30.819
Definitely white. I could see his face
around his mask.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.155
He was on the tall side. About 6 feet.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.282
Anything else you can tell us about him?

18:38.159 --> 18:39.494
No. (SCOFFS)

18:39.577 --> 18:40.578
Thanks for your time.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.500
So, look, I'd like to, um,
take another crack at Sharlene,

18:45.583 --> 18:47.335
but I wanna do it alone. Okay?
Okay.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.795
Gimme five minutes.
Yeah.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.842
Dr. Danover? Bruno Geller.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.385
Hi.
Central Chicago University.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.678
David Seldon.
How are you?

18:56.761 --> 18:58.304
Heather Holcomb. Microbiologists.
Hi.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.765
Dr. Halstead, Chicago Med.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.642
Thank you for coming.
We hope you can help.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.436
Do you recognize this staph?

19:06.938 --> 19:09.440
Oh, my God. David?

19:09.524 --> 19:12.193
That's E–87. But that's changed.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.112
How in God's name did this get out?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.197
Well, you tell us. What was your level
of security?

19:16.281 --> 19:19.242
Well, the highest... Level four.
There's no way that could've gotten out.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.996
Well, it did. Why were you even culturing
something so dangerous?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.205
For research.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.207
Research for...

19:26.291 --> 19:28.209
Well, we're working to develop antibiotics

19:28.293 --> 19:30.461
to help fight this kind
of resistant bacteria.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.630
Well, did you have any luck
finding anything?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.215
Actually, we might have
been quite close, but...

19:34.299 --> 19:36.509
All our data was destroyed in the fire.
Yeah.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.761
Incredible. (SIGHS)

19:41.180 --> 19:43.099
Well, Dr. Seldon, Dr. Holcomb,

19:43.182 --> 19:45.351
you have experience
working with this bacterium.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.644
Would you assist us?

19:46.728 --> 19:48.646
Um, hold on. But that research,

19:48.730 --> 19:50.481
whatever remains, is proprietary.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.942
The university can't just
hand over intellectual...

19:53.026 --> 19:55.403
People are dying and you're worried
about your bottom line?

19:55.486 --> 19:56.863
No, that's not...
We will help.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.740
Of course, we will help.
I mean, at the very least,

19:58.823 --> 20:02.577
I can help you to rule out the antibiotic
combinations I know to be ineffective.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.329
Great.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.455
Let's get to work.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.462
(ECG ALARMS BEEPING)

Has the family arrived yet?
Not yet.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.814
Okay.

21:12.897 --> 21:16.567
I'm going to put on some fresh scrubs,
and get something to eat.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.486
Find me when they're here. All right.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.031
DANIEL: It turns out that
you were absolutely right.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.034
Your building was deliberately
infected with bacteria

21:25.118 --> 21:28.287
that was very likely genetically altered.
By the CIA.

21:28.371 --> 21:31.082
They have secret labs everywhere.
But you know all about that.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.543
You know, I wish I could convince you
that I don't actually know

21:33.626 --> 21:35.795
all about that, but...
You're not gonna drug me.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.674
Hey, that's fine. That's your choice.
But, um...

21:41.426 --> 21:44.262
Sharlene, tell me,
how'd you figure it out?

21:44.345 --> 21:45.972
I mean, this person
who was spraying your building,

21:46.055 --> 21:47.682
how did you know that he was CIA?

21:47.765 --> 21:50.184
You're just playing games with me.
You're trying to trick me?

21:50.268 --> 21:53.604
Sharlene, I'm just trying to figure out
what happened here. I promise you.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.815
I'm not blind. I see everything.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.609
From my window, everything.
The drones with their cameras,

21:58.693 --> 21:59.944
the helicopters...
Yeah, but the guy

22:00.028 --> 22:01.571
that was actually doing the spraying.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.281
How did you know he was CIA?

22:03.364 --> 22:05.908
He wasn't a real exterminator.
He didn't even have a van.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.327
Just a little blue truck.
It was so obvious.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.663
I see. And what kind of truck

22:10.747 --> 22:12.999
does the CIA prefer
these days, like, what make?

22:13.082 --> 22:15.293
They change it all the time,
so it isn't suspicious.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.170
Well, can you remember
what kind this one was?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.796
A blue one.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.767
and it's just got worse, and...

And he's got it!
Okay. We don't know what his exposure

22:48.618 --> 22:50.536
to the bacteria was,
how strong his immune system is...

37:01.219 --> 37:03.680
We're working the infection case
that's already killed a half–dozen people.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.933
So, we need you to focus,
we need you to answer our questions.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.100
Blue Nissan.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.269
Yeah.

37:09.353 --> 37:10.395
(TYPING)

37:11.855 --> 37:13.565
Yeah, that pickup's only been rented once.

37:13.649 --> 37:17.527
I got a name, but it's Mike Smith.
He paid cash. So...

37:17.611 --> 37:19.029
When?

37:19.112 --> 37:20.280
Uh, three days ago.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.741
Okay, let's try a little harder?
Okay, what time?

37:22.824 --> 37:24.201
Morning? Afternoon? When?

37:24.284 --> 37:27.663
Yeah, yeah. Afternoon,
it was right before I ate my lunch.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.501
I take my break at 2:00.
So, it was right around then.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.752
BURGESS: Great. What did he look like?

37:33.835 --> 37:36.463
Oh, white guy. Um, yea big.

37:36.546 --> 37:39.091
Kinda his height.
I think he had a blue hat.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.301
Is there a video?
Yeah, yeah.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.845
But it's hosted off–site.
So, security company's

37:43.929 --> 37:45.263
gonna have to dropbox you the footage.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.265
Call them. We want footage
for the entire day.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.350
Right on.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.186
Now, Dalton.
Yup, you got it.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.900
NEWSCASTER ON TV:
An as yet undisclosed number of patients

37:56.984 --> 37:59.444
who fled quarantine remain at large.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.655
Authorities are working diligently
to track them down...

38:01.738 --> 38:03.115
It's wall–to–wall coverage with this now.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.241
While there is still no sign of a cure...

38:04.324 --> 38:07.035
Yep. Cindy called.
They're closing Luke's school.

38:08.203 --> 38:12.082
Seems that somebody over at that building
happens to be a janitor over there,

38:12.165 --> 38:13.625
and now a bunch of the parents
are demanding

38:13.709 --> 38:15.752
that the entire place get disinfected.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.674
Guys, this is that restaurant
up the street we go to,

38:20.757 --> 38:22.175
Garcia's Hacienda.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.555
KELLY: What the hell?

38:26.638 --> 38:28.015
It's one of those conspiracy sites.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.224
It's trending on Twitter.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.642
What's it say?

38:30.726 --> 38:35.439
That the outbreak is some kind
of MS–13 El Salvadoran plot

38:35.522 --> 38:37.858
to get revenge on America.

38:38.692 --> 38:42.446
Mama Garcia must be somehow involved

38:42.529 --> 38:45.115
because her food truck
was over at Soldier Field,

38:45.198 --> 38:47.367
and her restaurant is only a half a block

38:47.451 --> 38:51.163
from the quarantined apartment buildings.
(SCOFFS)

38:51.747 --> 38:53.457
That's ridiculous.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.293
Mama Garcia is pretty much
the sweetest lady in Chicago.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.295
Those who must commute via train or bus

38:58.378 --> 39:00.255
are wearing store–bought
protective gear...

39:00.338 --> 39:02.132
That's the kind of news
that gets people killed.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.217
...to remain calm.

39:04.301 --> 39:05.844
In the next hour we'll be speaking
with a representative

39:05.927 --> 39:08.805
from the CDC, who will
give us a status report

39:08.889 --> 39:10.307
on their research progress.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.184
(ALARM BUZZING)

39:29.951 --> 39:31.661
RUZEK: Blue hat, right before 2:00.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.165
Got it.

(CLEARS THROAT)

39:41.588 --> 39:44.007
I know this guy. He works at the CCU lab.

39:51.681 --> 39:55.018
You see, Heather, why don't you join
the others, get a bite.

39:55.102 --> 39:56.686
Yeah. I could use it.

39:56.770 --> 39:57.771
Bring you something?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.356
No. No, I'm good. Thanks.

40:22.379 --> 40:23.713
(HISSING)

40:30.971 --> 40:32.180
What're you doing?

40:32.264 --> 40:33.265
I'm sorry?

40:36.560 --> 40:37.561
You're destroying our work.

40:37.644 --> 40:40.147
Oh, no. No,
these were contaminated samples.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.443
You know what?
You need to stay right here.
