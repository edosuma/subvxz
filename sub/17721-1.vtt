00:15.750 --> 00:18.583
Well... I'm not that girl.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.750
My name is Erica Strange.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.375
I'm 32. Still working
a dead end job.

00:28.417 --> 00:31.291
Still sleeping with my cat.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.792
I know people wonder why
the cute girl

00:38.834 --> 00:40.792
with the great education
and the great friends

00:40.834 --> 00:43.417
can't get it together.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.291
There's a simple answer:

00:45.333 --> 00:48.208
bad decisions.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.208
I could teach a course
on messing up your life.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.083
Really, I am that good
at getting everything wrong.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.500
The worst part is,
it wasn't always like this,

00:56.542 --> 00:59.792
I used to be a rising star,
but these days...

00:59.834 --> 01:01.333
I just feel like a flame out.

How can I help you?

01:07.458 --> 01:10.333
Yes sir, were you planning on
purchasing a policy with us?

01:10.375 --> 01:13.083
Uh-huh, and how many people
Would you like to insure?

01:13.125 --> 01:15.667
(Keyboard keys clack)

01:20.542 --> 01:23.041
Uh, let me put you through
to another agent.

01:26.291 --> 01:27.834
Okay, okay.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.458
So, I know it's my fault
my life is where it's at,

01:30.500 --> 01:33.166
But I figure I gotta catch
a break some time, right?

01:33.208 --> 01:34.667
Judith: He fired you?

01:34.709 --> 01:36.709
Erica: He said I was
too bright for the job.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.959
- Well, That's wrongful
dismissal.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.083
I mean, clearly you can't fire
someone for being too smart.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.291
- It's just embarrassing,
I mean, I have a masters degree

01:44.333 --> 01:47.166
and I can't keep a customer
service job.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.083

01:49.125 --> 01:51.959
- I want to talk about this
but I've got a meeting.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.041
Will you call me tonight
after your date?

01:54.083 --> 01:55.583
- Yeah.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.208
- Lavalife, right?
What's his name?

01:57.250 --> 01:58.834
- Trevor.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.834
- Oh, yeah, the dentist.

02:00.875 --> 02:03.792
Third date?
- Yeah.

02:03.834 --> 02:05.375

02:05.417 --> 02:07.125
- Well, we had some trouble
setting this one set up.

02:07.166 --> 02:09.250
He keeps telling me
how busy he is

02:09.291 --> 02:10.792
and you know what that means.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.792
- That he's fixing teeth.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.125
Come on, Erica, I mean,
he's cute, he's smart,

02:16.166 --> 02:18.667
he's got a great job and
he's into you, I mean...

02:18.709 --> 02:20.542
three dates?

02:20.583 --> 02:22.875
Three dates means
you're basically together.

02:22.917 --> 02:24.375
- If we're basically together
I guess I shouldn't be

02:24.417 --> 02:26.041
looking up Noah LaFleur
on facebook, right?

02:26.083 --> 02:28.291

09:44.834 --> 09:46.959

This is... (laughs)
this is ridiculous,

33:14.959 --> 33:16.959
I can't even believe that
I'm having this conversation.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.834
- I'm just saying,
first you yell at Noah,

33:18.875 --> 33:20.917
then you won't drink
with us, like...

33:20.959 --> 33:24.709
- Look, I decided not to drink
and that is my prerogative.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.709
- You-you decided not to drink?

33:26.750 --> 33:29.125
Like, since when?!
Like, what the hell?!

33:29.166 --> 33:30.917
Then you come down here
tell Katie, "she's had enough".

33:32.542 --> 33:34.709
Who died and made you
the boss of her?

33:34.750 --> 33:36.959
- Nobody. You know what?
I'm leaving.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.041
(Katie vomits,
Erica screams in disgust)

33:39.083 --> 33:41.417
Katie: (nauseated groans)
Jenny: (laughs)

33:41.458 --> 33:43.959
- That's great.
- Oh, I'm sorry...

33:45.500 --> 33:47.375
That's just really disgusting.

33:47.417 --> 33:49.125
- Katie, maybe you should've
listened, huh?

33:49.166 --> 33:50.375
Jenny: Hey, I'll-I'll do that.
I'll do it.

33:50.417 --> 33:52.458
(Katie vomits)

33:52.500 --> 33:56.333
Erica: Go deal with, ugh, that.
(Jenny laughs)

33:56.375 --> 33:58.291
Katie: (Coughing)

33:59.875 --> 34:02.291
(Sickly vomiting and coughing)

34:02.333 --> 34:05.208
- Oh, my dress.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.125
(Vomiting)

34:08.166 --> 34:09.875
Jenny, honey, I need you
to come here.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.792
Katie: (Uncontrollable coughing)

34:14.375 --> 34:15.959
Listen, I have extra
gym clothes in my locker,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.917
it's 12, 33, 24.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.959
Okay, listen, 12, 33, 24.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.458
Just take this, dump it in there

34:23.500 --> 34:24.959
and bring back my gym clothes,
okay?

34:25.041 --> 34:27.667
12, 33, 24.

34:27.709 --> 34:31.333
12, 33, 24. Oh God.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.834
Hey, Katie, honey,
how are you doing?

34:33.875 --> 34:35.375
(Katie thuds hard onto floor)

34:35.417 --> 34:37.333
Katie? Katie.

34:38.834 --> 34:40.667
Kat- oh. Katie? Katie!

34:42.291 --> 34:43.583
Katie, please.
Katie, Katie, Katie.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.000
Wake up. Come on. Come on.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.041
Come on. Open your eyes. Shit!

34:47.083 --> 34:49.083
(Heels clomp)
Somebody, we need help!

34:51.208 --> 34:53.000
Hello! Jenny!

34:53.041 --> 34:56.000
Jenny! Somebody please help us!
Please!

34:56.041 --> 34:58.417
Helloooo!

34:58.458 --> 35:01.041
Katie? Katie?

35:01.083 --> 35:02.500
No, don't-don't-don't-don't.

35:02.542 --> 35:03.834
I don't even know
how to do this.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.166
Will somebody help me! Somebody!

35:06.792 --> 35:09.125
Katie: (Sickly groan)
Erica: Shit! Shit!

35:09.166 --> 35:11.041
(Nauseated, gurgled moans)

35:13.917 --> 35:15.792
Okay, honey. Okay, okay, okay.

to take an interest, though.

- Yeah, it is. Um...

37:00.208 --> 37:02.083
- Maybe you've noticed that
I've been acting a little
strange lately,

37:02.125 --> 37:04.500
a little unlike myself, but...

37:04.542 --> 37:08.417
and that would be because
I'm not really myself.

37:08.458 --> 37:09.917
- You're not?
- No.

37:12.375 --> 37:13.959
This is gonna make me
sound crazy,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.500
but the truth is,
is that I'm from the future.

37:19.417 --> 37:20.709
Wow, that sounds even more
crazy out loud

37:20.750 --> 37:22.417
than it does in my head.
- Erica...

37:22.458 --> 37:24.083
- Look, I'm a 32 year old woman,

37:24.125 --> 37:25.583
and I'm stuck inside
a 16 year-old body

37:25.625 --> 37:26.959
and I know that you're
not gonna believe me,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.333
but I'm telling you anyways,
because you,

37:28.375 --> 37:30.250
you seem nice and normal,
and my age.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.291
Actually you're probably
a little bit younger.

37:34.333 --> 37:36.417
- Uh...
- You don't believe me, right?

37:36.458 --> 37:38.208
Of course you don't believe-
I'm just gonna... forget it.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.417
Done. Ignore me. Is...

37:40.458 --> 37:42.291
- I wanna help you.

37:42.333 --> 37:44.375
The only way you could help me
is if you believe me

37:44.417 --> 37:47.959
and I know that's impossible.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.333
What the really
unbelievable thing is,

37:49.375 --> 37:51.250
is that I screwed it up again.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.709
God, I'm such an idiot. And...

37:55.750 --> 37:57.125
Now you're standing here,
you're thinking,

37:57.166 --> 37:59.625
"crazy girl just walked
naked through the formal".

37:59.667 --> 38:02.250
- Actually, you know,
I was thinking...

38:02.291 --> 38:05.542
That you did what
you had to do.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.542
To get your friend
the help that she needed.

38:07.583 --> 38:09.333
And under the circumstances
I wouldn't say

38:09.375 --> 38:11.208
That that's crazy,
I'd say that's brave.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.375
I know you've had
a difficult night.

38:16.417 --> 38:19.208
- You have no idea.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.125
- And I know that some
of the students

38:21.166 --> 38:23.083
are probably gonna talk...

38:23.125 --> 38:25.458
- That's the story of my life.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.542
(Shivers) God, it's really cold.

38:29.583 --> 38:31.375
- Why don't we go inside?

38:31.417 --> 38:33.417
And we can talk
and I'll call your parents

38:33.458 --> 38:35.041
and they can come
and pick you up, okay?

38:35.083 --> 38:37.083
- Uh, i'm just gonna get home,
Just...

38:37.125 --> 38:40.250
I'm really exhausted and...

38:40.291 --> 38:42.291
It's time for me to go home.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.125
(Knocking on room door,
Erica yelps, startled)

38:45.625 --> 38:47.667
(Heavy breaths)

38:47.709 --> 38:49.583
Um... (heavy breaths)

38:53.291 --> 38:54.667
Yes!

38:56.625 --> 38:58.375
- Oh, thank God, Erica.

38:58.417 --> 39:00.542
I have been worried sick
about you.

39:00.583 --> 39:02.083
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

39:02.125 --> 39:03.542
What is the point
of having a phone

39:03.583 --> 39:05.625
unless you answer the phone?
- Hey, dad?

39:07.125 --> 39:08.917
- Thank God, you're safe.

39:08.959 --> 39:11.000
- You know I called the police
when you jumped out the window.

39:11.041 --> 39:12.458
- Well, of course she jumped,

39:12.500 --> 39:13.792
I would have jumped
if I were her.

39:13.834 --> 39:15.250
- Okay, Gary, don't start.

39:15.291 --> 39:16.625
Um, wh-what time is it?
Gary: Two o'clock.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.166
- I called you at least
15 times.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.625
- Okay, so it was just...

39:20.667 --> 39:22.125
We just had brunch an hour ago?

39:22.166 --> 39:24.458
- Yes.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.542
- Trevor?
- Hi.

39:26.583 --> 39:29.166
- Um, Trevor - Mom and dad,
this is Trevor.

39:29.208 --> 39:31.375
- The doctor?
- Dentist. He's a dentist.

39:32.959 --> 39:34.250
- That's right.
- Nice to meet you.

39:34.291 --> 39:35.834
Trevor: Likewise.

39:35.875 --> 39:38.333
So, I was in the neighborhood,
plans fell through,

39:38.375 --> 39:40.000
I thought i'd drop by.

39:40.041 --> 39:41.583
- Oh, how lovely.

39:41.625 --> 39:43.625
Am I interrupting anything.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.583
- No, no.
- We were just leaving.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.291
- Yes we were.
- All right.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.125
- You wanna grab a bite?

39:50.166 --> 39:51.667
- Okay.

39:51.709 --> 39:53.417
Yeah? You gonna...
get changed first?

39:55.041 --> 39:56.583
People might think
you look a little strange.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.625
- Oh.
- (Laughs)

39:58.667 --> 40:01.333
- Right.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.375
But you know what?
Actually, so what?

40:03.417 --> 40:05.125
- Erica.

40:05.166 --> 40:07.792
- Seriously, at least
I'm dressed. Right?

40:07.834 --> 40:09.417
(Heavy sigh) On second thought,
Trevor,

40:09.458 --> 40:11.333
I think that we should
skip that bite.

40:11.375 --> 40:14.041
I don't wanna waste your time.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.959
Actually, I don't want to waste
mine.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.291

an office.

40:47.667 --> 40:49.667
You know, I find that too...
confining.

40:49.709 --> 40:51.375
Oh, I apologize,

40:51.417 --> 40:53.333
I'm not able to chat
with you right now.

40:53.375 --> 40:55.083
But our next session
will begin shortly.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.333
I have your list.

40:56.375 --> 40:57.542
- Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.375
- We have a lot of work to do,
you and me.

40:59.417 --> 41:00.792
No, I'm just kidding.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.208
But you did make a commitment.

41:02.250 --> 41:04.625
- No, what commitment?!
You set me up.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.208
You set me up and I humiliated
myself... again.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.750
Only this time,

41:08.792 --> 41:10.333
I really gave everyone
something to talk about.

41:10.375 --> 41:12.458
- As always, it's what everyone
else thinks.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.583
- What, you expect me
not to care?

41:14.625 --> 41:16.250
Is that the whole point
of this exercise?

41:16.291 --> 41:18.834
Because if it is, guess what?
I failed.

41:18.875 --> 41:21.542
Because I still care.
And I'm always gonna care!

41:21.583 --> 41:24.250
You realize you're screaming.
- So?!

41:24.291 --> 41:26.291
- So when you blew off
that dentist,

41:26.333 --> 41:28.291
you cared that your parents
were gonna be disappointed,

41:28.333 --> 41:29.792
right?
- Yes. But that--

41:29.834 --> 41:31.542
- And when you walked through
that gymnasium,

41:31.583 --> 41:33.625
You cared that everybody
was staring at you?

41:33.667 --> 41:35.834
- Yes!
- But you did it anyway?

41:35.875 --> 41:37.750
- Yeah, because I had to.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.792
- We don't have to do anything.

41:39.834 --> 41:42.500
- You know what? Screw this,
I am done.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.667
- No you're not done!

41:44.709 --> 41:47.333
I never expected you
To stop caring, Erica.

41:47.375 --> 41:51.125
I just wanted you to stop
letting that get in your way.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.709
You didn't fail, Erica.

41:59.291 --> 42:01.000
With your parents opinions,

42:01.041 --> 42:03.667
and your, and your friends
opinions, yeah, of course,

42:03.709 --> 42:06.417
they're always gonna matter...

42:06.458 --> 42:08.792
They just don't matter
as much as your own.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.709
I have to leave now.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.583
I'll see you soon.

42:21.333 --> 42:23.250
- Wait.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.583
Hey!

42:26.625 --> 42:28.667
Change.

42:28.709 --> 42:31.291
Sometimes it sneaks up on you.

42:31.333 --> 42:33.750
Sometimes it hits you
over the head.

42:33.792 --> 42:35.291
And sometimes...

42:35.333 --> 42:36.959
you turn a corner,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.166
only to find you're different
in some small way.

42:40.834 --> 42:42.834
And the world, it doesn't look
quite like it used to.

42:44.333 --> 42:46.667
So where do I go from here?

42:46.709 --> 42:48.667
No idea.

42:48.709 --> 42:50.542
And for the first time...

42:50.583 --> 42:52.375
I feel like that's
a good thing.
