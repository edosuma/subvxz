00:00.583 --> 00:03.458
(insects chirping)

00:12.542 --> 00:15.250
(woman groaning)

00:29.417 --> 00:32.792
(tense electronic tones)

00:35.292 --> 00:37.583
- I thought I had more time.

00:47.667 --> 00:50.292
(woman screams)

01:04.208 --> 01:07.375
(anxious piano music)

02:20.083 --> 02:21.083
- It's time.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.667
Send the invitations.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.750
(anxious classical violin music)

03:08.917 --> 03:11.917
(crickets chirping)

03:57.167 --> 04:01.250
(anxious classical violin music)

04:11.667 --> 04:14.250
I apologize about that, fellas.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.707
Very nice to meet you all.

04:17.707 --> 04:19.457
- Anyways, before we
get down to the reason

04:19.457 --> 04:22.042
for why we're here,
let's just sit back,

04:22.042 --> 04:25.832
have a few drinks and
get to know each other.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.332
- The symmetry of this film,

04:28.332 --> 04:32.667
the way they composed each
shot, the acting, I mean,

04:33.875 --> 04:35.292
I can't believe it.
- It's pretty good.

04:35.292 --> 04:36.582
Yo, could I?

04:36.582 --> 04:39.832
- What do you
think, you want one?

04:39.832 --> 04:41.582
- It's been a minute.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.707
- It was amazing,
absolutely amazing.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.875
So Logan, let me tell you,

04:51.875 --> 04:55.125
your last film was
truly an experience.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.082
To think that I'm sitting
at this dinner table

04:58.082 --> 05:01.417
with potentially the greatest
filmmaker of our generation.

05:01.417 --> 05:03.833
- I can attest to that
Logan, your last film was,

05:03.833 --> 05:05.667
some might call it a
religious experience.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.042
- Fellas, listen.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.042
We're just some guys having
drinks at a table, that's all.

05:13.542 --> 05:14.208
Nick.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.792
Quite the performance at

05:16.792 --> 05:18.500
the Grammy's a couple
months ago, huh?

05:18.500 --> 05:20.457
- Oh yeah, appreciate that.

05:20.457 --> 05:22.207
I'm just more baffled
that I'm sitting

05:22.207 --> 05:23.750
across from this
mastermind right now.

05:23.750 --> 05:24.917
- Men, listen.

05:26.125 --> 05:29.125
I understand this
is strange, okay?

05:29.125 --> 05:30.832
The reason you're here is
'cause you're some of the most

05:30.832 --> 05:33.625
creative and talented people
in the world right now,

05:33.625 --> 05:35.792
all of you just as
successful as the next.

05:35.792 --> 05:39.417
The world's in front of
each and every one of you.

05:39.417 --> 05:43.042
- Yeah, I made a good
film, great, awesome.

05:45.082 --> 05:46.292
I appreciate your love

05:46.292 --> 05:49.292
and support but I'm
just a guy, truly.

05:55.042 --> 05:59.625
And you want to know the
difference between us and them?

06:02.292 --> 06:04.208
We are the true talent.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.958
The unique, the pure.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.125
We're not the shallow.

06:18.207 --> 06:22.917
So Andrew, any new projects
you've been working on?

06:22.917 --> 06:25.957
- Yeah, actually I'm working
on this project right now.

06:25.957 --> 06:29.707
It's an adaptation of a
book called "The Swerve."

06:29.707 --> 06:32.792
- Yeah, and the, what is it?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.625
"The Nature of Things," right?
- Yeah, that's right.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.167
"The Nature of Things."

06:36.167 --> 06:38.500
- That's good.
- What's the story?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.332
- It's a hunt for
an ancient poem

06:40.332 --> 06:42.167
that basically tells the future.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.582
It's gonna be an adventure film

06:43.582 --> 06:45.042
and we have a big
budget this time.

06:45.042 --> 06:47.375
I'm pretty excited
about that actually.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.957
- You're with Old Oaks
Entertainment, right?

06:48.957 --> 06:51.082
- Yeah, Old Oaks Entertainment.

06:51.082 --> 06:52.792
- Any notable castings?

06:52.792 --> 06:56.500
- We're still in pretty
early stages, so no, not yet.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.042
- [Logan] What
about Arthur here?

06:59.042 --> 07:00.667
I mean I don't
want to put my foot

07:00.667 --> 07:03.042
in my mouth or anything
but it's a little bit

07:03.042 --> 07:05.708
more dramatic than the
stuff you're used to.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.375
(Logan laughs)

07:07.375 --> 07:09.500
- Arthur, he says
you can't do drama.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.833
- That's good, that's good.
- That's not it at all.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.500
It would be a dream
come true to have you.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.792
- I fuckin' love that.

07:15.792 --> 07:19.417
- I'm just joking,
I'm just joking, wine?

07:19.417 --> 07:21.832
- Oh, no thanks, I'm good.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.957
- This meeting's a celebration
of success, come on.

07:24.957 --> 07:27.042
- No seriously, I'm okay.

07:27.957 --> 07:28.792
- Okay.

07:30.417 --> 07:35.082
Flynn, the master artist,
what have you been working on?

07:36.332 --> 07:38.832
- Well, recently I've
been working less

07:38.832 --> 07:42.082
for myself and more
for commission.

07:42.082 --> 07:43.875
Not because I need
it or anything

07:43.875 --> 07:46.500
but I'm becoming more popular.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.707
You see, these wealthy people,

07:48.707 --> 07:51.207
they're willing to buy my
art for a commission price,

07:51.207 --> 07:55.292
footing their homes, their
apartments or whatever.

07:55.292 --> 07:57.375
It's been good to me.

07:57.375 --> 08:00.000
- Chrone, what about you,
big guy, what you been up to?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.708
I heard that movie "Nebulous."

08:01.708 --> 08:03.250
- Yeah, "Nebulous."

08:04.583 --> 08:07.458
Great script, a cosmic
murder mystery, you watch it?

08:07.458 --> 08:09.542
- Yeah, I did.
- Really intense.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.750
Had my knuckles
white the whole film.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.417
Not to mention, I think it
was your broadest range yet.

08:15.417 --> 08:18.582
- Thank you, I
appreciate that Logan.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.667
Yeah but you know,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.417
it's good for me now
to take some time off.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.332
I mean I've been in
this business, what?

08:25.332 --> 08:27.582
Since I was five years old.

08:28.792 --> 08:32.042
So I'll just take some
time, focus on myself.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.917
That kinda stuff.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.332
- Godspeed.

08:35.332 --> 08:37.667
And my musical
friend what of you?

08:37.667 --> 08:41.292
- I mean I'm on tour, I mean
pretty much late in the tour.

08:41.292 --> 08:43.000
But I got the phone
call about this

08:43.000 --> 08:45.625
and I knew it was something
I couldn't pass up.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.250
So you know, here we are.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.458
- I think you made
the right choice.

08:50.458 --> 08:54.042
(soft anxious piano music)

08:57.042 --> 08:59.875
(thunder booming)

09:01.625 --> 09:03.625
Gentlemen, I gather
you here on this

09:03.625 --> 09:05.833
glorious occasion
because you are some

09:05.833 --> 09:09.417
of the world's most up and
coming creators right now.

09:09.417 --> 09:10.833
An artist,

09:10.833 --> 09:12.333
a musician,

09:12.333 --> 09:13.167
an actor

09:14.042 --> 09:15.292
and a director.

09:16.750 --> 09:20.500
I gather you here because
I've written my next script

09:20.500 --> 09:23.750
and one of you will
be chosen to have it

09:23.750 --> 09:26.042
and adapt it into
any way you so choose

09:26.042 --> 09:29.625
as long as you remain true
to the text on the page.

09:29.625 --> 09:33.167
It is the greatest
thing I've ever written.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.333
Now there are a few rules.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.792
You must stay until
Sunday evening

09:38.792 --> 09:41.167
and you must have a good time.

09:41.167 --> 09:42.500
Sunday evening, I will choose

09:42.500 --> 09:45.667
the recipient of the
script and that's all.

09:45.667 --> 09:48.833
We all go our separate ways.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.042
- Why wouldn't you make it?

09:54.083 --> 09:56.583
- Afraid I won't do it
justice this time around.

09:56.583 --> 10:01.292
My last film drained me,
for a lack of better words.

10:01.292 --> 10:03.417
I believe in one of you.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.042
- You expect one
of us to make it?

10:05.042 --> 10:07.125
Bro, I do music, I don't know
how to make a fucking film.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.917
- It's not about knowing.

10:08.917 --> 10:12.250
It's about how you
see it, your vision.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.917
- What's it about?

10:13.917 --> 10:16.750
- That'll be for the eyes of
the chosen one, as you will.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.292
Gentlemen, if you don't want
to be here, then you can go.

10:20.292 --> 10:24.542
There'll be no hard feelings
but, but, but if you stay,

10:24.542 --> 10:27.250
you might like what you find.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.542
Plus, when are you gonna have

10:28.542 --> 10:30.750
a weekend this
interesting again?

10:30.750 --> 10:32.333
Look where you are.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.292
You in, Andrew?

10:36.708 --> 10:37.500
- I'm in.

10:38.542 --> 10:39.333
- Flynn?

10:40.583 --> 10:42.292
- I suppose.

10:42.292 --> 10:43.083
- Arthur?

10:45.917 --> 10:47.292
Nick?
- Fuck yeah.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.167
- [Logan] Good.

10:54.167 --> 10:57.167
(film reel rattling)

11:07.625 --> 11:10.792
(relaxed piano music)

11:26.500 --> 11:30.708
- You gotta let us know
how you made that film.

11:30.708 --> 11:32.875
- It was just a beautiful
idea that hit me.

11:32.875 --> 11:36.833
Sometimes a rose is a
rose is a rose, you know?

11:36.833 --> 11:40.042
- Listen, I'm a music guy but
I'm also a movie guy and that

11:40.042 --> 11:44.000
shit was the most mind-fucking
movie I've ever seen.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.792
- It was pretty damn
good, wasn't it?

11:45.792 --> 11:46.792
- Damn good.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.958
- What's playing
on the screen here?

11:55.125 --> 11:58.708
- This is an old film,
old experimental film

11:59.667 --> 12:01.667
known as "Adoration."

12:01.667 --> 12:04.667
It runs about 11
to 12 hours long.

12:04.667 --> 12:08.208
It fuels my creativity,
I watch it all the time

12:08.208 --> 12:11.292
and every time I
watch it, it changes

12:12.667 --> 12:13.500
or I do.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.042
I don't know.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.667
- Is there a story to it?

12:17.667 --> 12:18.958
- I've been trying to piece one

12:18.958 --> 12:20.917
together for a long time now.

12:20.917 --> 12:23.958
I believe it's about
a young girl wandering

12:23.958 --> 12:26.750
the woods and this young
girl has two sides,

12:26.750 --> 12:30.417
one side human but one
side, something else.

12:32.292 --> 12:33.875
Such courage in it.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.250
You know, you'd be surprised.

12:39.250 --> 12:43.792
I come off as a movie guy
but I'm also a music guy.

12:43.792 --> 12:48.667
So I've been experimenting
with the guitar a bit.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.875
I call this one "The Cave."

13:12.875 --> 13:16.042
(up tempo rock music)

13:59.417 --> 14:00.667
- [Nick] Damn, love it, yo.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.333
You got that Robert
Johnson vibe in there.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.167
- Yeah?

14:05.583 --> 14:07.583
Robert Johnson, huh?

14:07.583 --> 14:09.500
- Who's Robert Johnson?

14:11.583 --> 14:14.250
- A man who sold his
soul to the Devil

14:14.250 --> 14:16.458
at a crossroad in Mississippi.

14:16.458 --> 14:21.167
In exchange, the Devil handed
him back his guitar, tuned.

14:23.958 --> 14:26.000
- I got one more for you.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.833
(warbling mid
tempo guitar music)

15:21.083 --> 15:24.167
Beautiful song, right Flynn?

15:24.167 --> 15:25.000
- Yes.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.042
- This place is amazing, Logan.

15:32.042 --> 15:34.125
You live here year round?

15:35.250 --> 15:37.333
- Actually it runs
in the family.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.333
It's where my father
used to write.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.250
But no, I usually am in my place

15:42.250 --> 15:43.917
in New York or my
apartment in LA.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.875
I'm very fortunate, you see.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.042
But I know you guys have
all bright futures too.

15:48.042 --> 15:51.042
I mean, we're all
practically the same age.

15:51.042 --> 15:53.667
I was just at the right
place at the right time.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.375
It's called luck.

15:55.375 --> 15:57.583
- Luck may have a part
of it but nobody's

15:57.583 --> 16:00.042
gonna doubt the greatness
in that head of yours.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.375
- I appreciate that,
Arthur, I truly do.

16:05.250 --> 16:09.417
- So, I saw your debut
film, very, very well done.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.708
- Thank you.

16:11.708 --> 16:12.917
- How were you able
to get all the pieces

16:12.917 --> 16:15.417
together and make
such a good product?

16:15.417 --> 16:19.417
- Well, I was in my
college town and I figured

16:19.417 --> 16:23.375
I'd make a movie
about depression,
existentialism, anxiety.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.292
I had my boys there with
me, so we did it together

16:26.292 --> 16:30.375
and honestly I never expected
it to but it blew up.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.042
- Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.417
- Thanks.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.458
- Truly an accomplishment.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.375
If I'm not too bold to say it,

16:38.375 --> 16:40.083
you come from the
middle of nowhere

16:40.083 --> 16:43.417
with no connections in
this industry or any others

16:43.417 --> 16:47.125
and yet you were found,
your voice was heard.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.292
- Thank you, but it
was very unexpected.

16:51.292 --> 16:52.125
- Very.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.625
Flynn, you're a
deeply unique artist.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.583
Tell me something profound.

17:02.583 --> 17:03.417
- Well,

17:05.125 --> 17:07.458
I guess it's a famous quote.

17:08.708 --> 17:09.875
"If you think,

17:11.250 --> 17:12.583
you are doomed."

17:13.791 --> 17:15.333
That's why I paint.

17:16.375 --> 17:19.583
- "If you think,
you are doomed."

17:19.583 --> 17:22.458
That's one way of
looking at it of course.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.166
Man's greatest
enemy is his mind.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.792
But I also believe man's
greatest ally is his mind.

17:29.792 --> 17:34.208
So if you think you are doomed,
no, I don't believe that.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.708
If you think, you may be free.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.375
- [Arthur] Cheers to that.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.000
- [Logan] Cheers to us, men.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.708
To our work and our lives.

17:45.708 --> 17:48.667
(soft piano music)

18:12.458 --> 18:14.125
- That was fun, wasn't it?

18:14.125 --> 18:15.500
- Yeah, it was.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.750
I like your friend Lauren a lot.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.333
- Yeah, she's the best.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.833
- Where's she from again?

18:19.833 --> 18:23.250
- California, she cannot stop
talking about your movie.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.083
- Yeah, it was
really sweet of her.

18:26.083 --> 18:29.500
- So, have you spoken
to mom recently?

18:29.500 --> 18:33.750
- No, I haven't gotten around
to it but I probably should.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.208
- You really should,
I don't know.

18:36.208 --> 18:39.042
She just seems super
lonely these days.

18:39.042 --> 18:42.875
- I know, I've just been so
busy, I haven't been able to.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.375
- Yeah, I get it.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.333
Thanks for coming to visit
me, you being a big shot now.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.542
- Shut up, you know I
love coming down here.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.542
- Well, there was
also one more thing

18:51.542 --> 18:53.208
that I want to
talk to you about.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.042
- Oh yeah?

18:55.875 --> 18:58.542
- So I kept it a secret for
a couple of days now when

18:58.542 --> 19:02.083
you were visiting and I want
you to be the first to know.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.708
- [Andrew] What is it?

19:03.708 --> 19:05.917
Don't tell me you're pregnant.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.583
- No, Luke proposed.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.083
- No.
- Yes.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.750
- Oh my god.
- Can you believe it?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.250
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.083
- Wow.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.417
How'd he do it?

19:16.417 --> 19:18.667
- I'll tell you in the car.
- Okay.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.792
Wow, I'm so happy for you.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.833
- Yeah, he's really
the best guy.

19:22.833 --> 19:23.667
- Shit.

19:25.875 --> 19:26.708
Oh jeez.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.125
- [Adrianne] You're
good to drive, right?

19:29.125 --> 19:30.375
- Yeah, oh yeah.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.708
- You didn't drink or anything?

19:31.708 --> 19:33.917
- I had like one or
two, but I'm good.

19:33.917 --> 19:36.750
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

19:44.292 --> 19:47.125
(thunder booming)

19:57.875 --> 19:58.708
- Andrew,

20:00.708 --> 20:03.250
you're so soft-spoken.

20:03.250 --> 20:07.125
I've seen you in interviews
before and you're so talkative.

20:07.125 --> 20:10.208
- Yeah, I was probably
fucking drunk.

20:12.792 --> 20:15.125
I had a bit of a drinking
problem on my last film.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.500
So, I've toned it down a bit.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.000
- Cheers to that.

20:26.542 --> 20:31.375
I guess it takes courage to
admit when you have a problem.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.250
Me myself, personally,

20:42.708 --> 20:46.167
I never use this to cope with
anything going on around me.

20:46.167 --> 20:50.375
I use it as a point of
celebration amongst friends.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.417
It's good.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.500
- On tour, I probably
drink way too much.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.792
I mean every city,
new night, new liquor.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.333
There's not really
much I can do about it.

21:01.333 --> 21:04.292
It's a terrible
habit but you know,

21:04.292 --> 21:06.500
it comes with the
career, I love doing it

21:06.500 --> 21:08.792
and I'm rich, so
I guess I'm gone.

21:08.792 --> 21:11.208
- You enjoy performing?

21:11.208 --> 21:13.208
- Yeah of course, I
mean I love performing.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.042
All my best memories.

21:15.042 --> 21:16.667
- I love our shows.

21:17.917 --> 21:21.500
Having random
unintelligent rat critics

21:21.500 --> 21:25.417
scurry around my work,
trying to figure it out.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.750
That's why I drink.

21:29.750 --> 21:32.042
- It was a funny thing.

21:32.042 --> 21:36.250
In old Italy, a parallel
between alcohol and death.

21:38.125 --> 21:41.875
I'm not saying alcohol
necessarily causes death, no.

21:41.875 --> 21:45.208
But it moves us from a
point of clear consciousness

21:45.208 --> 21:48.750
closer to death, as if
we're on a spectrum.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.292
Funny, isn't it?

21:52.292 --> 21:56.542
Because when you drink, you
feel so much more alive.

22:01.167 --> 22:05.750
And I must warn you, I have
another guest in the house.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.417
He is my doctor.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.042
Well, more my mentor.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.708
I've been going through
a slightly troubled time

22:16.708 --> 22:20.125
since my last film and
he's helping me through it.

22:20.125 --> 22:23.375
He's a bit antisocial,
a bit unorthodox

22:25.375 --> 22:28.083
but pay him no mind,
he means very well.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.917
(anxious violin music)

22:29.917 --> 22:32.125
- What kinda doctor?

22:32.125 --> 22:34.708
- A psychologist, more or less.

22:36.125 --> 22:39.625
Don't be startled
when you see him.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.792
He's just a bit out there.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.000
- Out there how?

22:46.167 --> 22:48.708
- You'll know when you see him.

22:53.292 --> 22:56.375
(anxious piano music)

23:06.917 --> 23:10.750
(anxious electronic warbling)

24:06.917 --> 24:09.292
Good morning, Andrew.

24:09.292 --> 24:11.917
- Good morning, Logan.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.792
- You drink coffee?

24:13.792 --> 24:15.250
- Of course.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.500
- Well, there's
coffee in the kitchen.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.625
Grab yourself a
cup and then after,

24:19.625 --> 24:22.875
meet me outside, I got
something to show you, okay?

24:22.875 --> 24:24.500
- Sure.
- All right.

24:26.333 --> 24:29.542
(relaxed guitar music)

24:32.125 --> 24:36.042
(anxious metallic piano music)

25:12.958 --> 25:15.958
So, you saw my doctor wandering

25:15.958 --> 25:19.667
the grounds last
night, didn't you?

25:19.667 --> 25:21.667
- I did, how'd you know?

25:24.542 --> 25:27.042
- You seem uncomfortable here.

25:28.625 --> 25:31.583
The only reason I can
see causing that is you

25:31.583 --> 25:36.583
witnessing a masked man wander
outside your room at night.

25:37.708 --> 25:40.500
- It's true, why does
he wear that mask?

25:42.167 --> 25:46.417
- He's strange, his methods
aren't always approved.

25:47.375 --> 25:49.458
- Approved, approved how?

25:52.167 --> 25:53.833
- He uses hypnotism,

25:55.250 --> 25:59.792
brings me to a place of
peace and clear-mindedness.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.708
The mask just calms me,

26:03.125 --> 26:06.125
it separates me
from his human side.

26:11.917 --> 26:15.833
You know it all started
right here, what we do,

26:17.083 --> 26:19.167
on walls just like these.

26:20.167 --> 26:22.083
- [Andrew] What's that?

26:23.000 --> 26:23.833
- Art.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.333
No likes, no
streams, no dislikes.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.167
Just pure.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.417
- How do you know
if it's any good?

26:34.542 --> 26:35.375
- Funny.

26:37.167 --> 26:40.167
Maybe it's the way it should be.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.333
Let's go back.

26:48.792 --> 26:52.542

27:11.500 --> 27:14.583

- Why

28:41.458 --> 28:42.375
do you keep

28:43.667 --> 28:45.417
making me watch this?

28:50.417 --> 28:52.167
Please shut this off.

29:05.792 --> 29:09.208
(tense electronic tones)

29:20.333 --> 29:23.917
(anxious deep piano music)

29:40.708 --> 29:41.542
- Logan,

29:42.708 --> 29:45.375
I swear on my life, I saw a body

29:47.083 --> 29:48.083
right there.

29:49.208 --> 29:51.375
Just floating, motionless.

29:53.917 --> 29:58.208
- You're telling me you
saw a dead body in my pool?

30:00.708 --> 30:01.542
- Yeah.

30:02.583 --> 30:03.417
I mean,

30:05.542 --> 30:06.875
I thought I did.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.542
I could just be scaring myself.

30:12.583 --> 30:13.667
- Who was it?

30:15.417 --> 30:17.917
I don't know, I couldn't tell.

30:19.333 --> 30:20.167
- Strange.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.917
- [Nick] So what's been
going on with Flynn?

30:28.917 --> 30:30.583
- I have no idea.

30:30.583 --> 30:33.208
I'm not associating
with that schizophrenic,

30:33.208 --> 30:35.667
splatter-painting maniac.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.292
- What?

30:37.292 --> 30:39.042
Why? He's a good guy.

30:40.417 --> 30:44.958
- I don't doubt that but
have you not heard the story?

30:44.958 --> 30:47.167
- [Andrew] What story?

30:47.167 --> 30:48.500
- All right, look.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.583
The man was institutionalized
his whole life.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.375
He gets out, a year later,

30:52.375 --> 30:56.250
his entire home burns down
and his whole family dies.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.167
They say it was a coincidence.

30:59.167 --> 31:01.000
I don't really buy it.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.292
- Oh my god.

31:04.625 --> 31:05.958
That's terrible.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.042
You got a cigarette?

31:10.042 --> 31:11.375
- [Arthur] Yeah.

31:28.792 --> 31:29.792
- Thank you.

31:33.333 --> 31:34.167
- So,

31:35.583 --> 31:39.333
Sleepwalker, I'm curious
how you came up with that.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.167
- That's a good question.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.500
I guess I just kinda see people

31:43.500 --> 31:46.250
as these zombies
just kinda going

31:46.250 --> 31:49.833
through the motions
every day, sleepwalking.

31:49.833 --> 31:52.917
I'd say I'm one of
those zombies too.

31:53.833 --> 31:55.500
- I can get to that.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.375
- What about you, Arthur?

32:01.042 --> 32:03.208
How'd you get into acting?

32:04.292 --> 32:06.000
- Like I said last night,

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
I've been doing this since
I was five years old.

32:12.083 --> 32:15.375
I guess it stems from my father.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.708
Let's just say he
was a loose cannon

32:17.708 --> 32:19.375
and when I was young,
my mother wanted

32:19.375 --> 32:22.042
to get me away from that
as much as possible.

32:22.042 --> 32:24.750
So when I was young, she signed
me up for acting classes.

32:24.750 --> 32:29.042
I started doing that and
it's led me to this point.

32:31.292 --> 32:32.125
- Well,

32:33.208 --> 32:35.333
you've done pretty
damn well for yourself.

32:35.333 --> 32:38.042
You should be proud of that.

32:38.042 --> 32:40.208
- I guess I'm just scared.

32:41.375 --> 32:45.542
I'm scared that these
violent roles I portray

32:45.542 --> 32:48.500
are just slowly
turning me into him.

32:51.625 --> 32:53.417
- So why do you
think he chose us?

32:53.417 --> 32:57.250
I mean there's millions of
actors, directors, musicians.

32:57.250 --> 33:00.458
I don't get what
makes us so special.

33:00.458 --> 33:03.875
- 'Cause we're all
fucked up in the head.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.917
(anxious piano music)

33:52.958 --> 33:56.750
(ominous electronic warbling)

34:29.125 --> 34:32.167
(tense violin tones)

34:54.333 --> 34:56.958
(glass tapping)

35:04.500 --> 35:08.167
(upbeat country rock music)

35:22.083 --> 35:25.167
(mid tempo drumbeat)

36:31.292 --> 36:35.292
- I see you're not drinking,
which is admirable.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.792
But you gotta think,

36:38.792 --> 36:41.625
you're in a position most
people would kill for.

36:41.625 --> 36:44.042
You're at a beautiful home with

36:44.042 --> 36:45.958
one of the world's most
acclaimed directors

36:45.958 --> 36:48.625
and other successful
creators and yet,

36:48.625 --> 36:51.750
you seem to not be
enjoying yourself.

36:53.417 --> 36:55.125
- It's not that, it's

36:57.167 --> 37:01.292
just something happened
to me recently and

37:01.292 --> 37:04.958
I don't like not feeling
in control anymore.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.958
- No time for control.

37:12.292 --> 37:14.292
Beautiful day, isn't it?

37:15.458 --> 37:16.292
- Yes.

37:20.042 --> 37:23.875
(anxious piano, violin music)

38:04.667 --> 38:07.917
(tense metallic tones)

38:38.083 --> 38:40.917
- "Pulp Fiction's" overrated.

38:40.917 --> 38:44.208
- Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

38:44.208 --> 38:45.792
Look, you're a musician.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.625
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

38:47.625 --> 38:51.042
But "Pulp Fiction" is
a stroke of genius.

38:52.417 --> 38:56.708
"Fight Club," Fight
Club," now that is a film.

38:56.708 --> 38:58.417
You could boast Tarkovsky
all the live long day

38:58.417 --> 39:02.250
if you want to but "Fight
Club" is prime cinema.

39:02.250 --> 39:05.750
- Honestly, one of the
worst movies I've ever seen.

39:05.750 --> 39:08.208
- Your last album was garbage.

39:08.208 --> 39:09.833
- Are you fucking kidding me?

39:09.833 --> 39:11.333
Coming out to my
work, I literally had

39:11.333 --> 39:13.208
a number one on the billboard,
you know how hard that is?

39:13.208 --> 39:16.208
- I don't care, it's my opinion.

39:16.208 --> 39:17.042
- Nick.

39:20.042 --> 39:24.917
I don't know much about
you or where you come from.

39:24.917 --> 39:27.917
Tell me a little
bit about yourself.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.792
- I mean, honestly
not much to tell.

39:30.792 --> 39:33.250
I bounced around a lot as a kid.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.375
Never really knew my dad

39:35.375 --> 39:37.292
but was always pretty
inspired by music.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.958
That was pretty
much my sanctuary.

39:39.958 --> 39:41.875
I made a band with my friends.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.958
I mean, got picked
up by a label,

39:43.958 --> 39:46.708
did some shows, saw
some success but

39:46.708 --> 39:50.542
eventually broke up 'cause
of creative differences.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.333
It's probably how I
lost all my friends but

39:53.333 --> 39:56.750
I mean, that's how it
goes when you're creative.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.458
- You got a girl?
- No, I don't have a girl.

39:58.458 --> 40:00.458
But you know how
that story goes.

40:00.458 --> 40:03.833
Fucking everything
with a heartbeat.

40:03.833 --> 40:07.375
Honestly, I would
like a girl but

40:07.375 --> 40:10.167
I never really met one that
has good intentions, you know?

40:10.167 --> 40:12.667
I'm always on the road
meeting so many people,

40:12.667 --> 40:15.458
everyone just wants different
things and I don't know,

40:15.458 --> 40:17.167
I guess it's what comes
with the industry,

40:17.167 --> 40:18.958
comes with the job.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.125
One day maybe.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.292
- There was

40:24.625 --> 40:25.625
once a story

40:27.375 --> 40:28.333
of a Saint,

40:31.208 --> 40:33.167
Saint Francis of Assisi.

40:35.875 --> 40:36.667
This man

40:37.583 --> 40:39.292
was a Prince,

40:39.292 --> 40:40.750
a partier,

40:40.750 --> 40:41.542
an heir.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.250
One day, some say

40:46.167 --> 40:49.875
he heard the voice of
God speak into his ear.

40:51.792 --> 40:56.000
He gave up his old life
and occupied a new one.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.667
One of simplicity,
one of purity.

41:03.042 --> 41:08.042
Later on, he underwent
an experience known
as the stigmata,

41:09.167 --> 41:11.375
otherwise known as
the wounds of Christ.

41:14.208 --> 41:17.083
To him, this was
not suffering, no.

41:18.417 --> 41:19.250
To him,

41:20.583 --> 41:21.958
this was ecstasy.

41:24.542 --> 41:26.250
Imagine the feeling.

41:29.000 --> 41:29.833
Anyways,

41:31.292 --> 41:36.250
he went on to worship the
sun, the moon, the sands.

41:36.250 --> 41:40.917
He would save worms from roads
so they were not crushed.

41:45.083 --> 41:48.417
And he went on to
become the Great Saint.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.083
A beautiful story,
isn't it Arthur?

42:03.958 --> 42:05.375
- You up for a scrap?
- Yeah.

42:05.375 --> 42:07.042
Logan, tell us when.

42:12.917 --> 42:14.625
(tense metallic tones)

42:14.625 --> 42:15.458
- Fight.

42:21.625 --> 42:23.958
- Are you fucking kidding me?

42:23.958 --> 42:28.958
(thuds)
(tense spidery tones)

42:39.875 --> 42:41.375
- Arthur, what the fuck, man?

42:41.375 --> 42:44.208
You could have
fucking killed him.

42:45.250 --> 42:46.292
Dude, what?

42:46.292 --> 42:48.583
We have to fucking help him.

43:00.583 --> 43:01.417
- Ecstasy.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.000
- I gotcha.

43:12.417 --> 43:13.583
You all right?

43:19.167 --> 43:21.208
Come on, we're
going right there.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.542
(tense violin tones)

43:24.542 --> 43:27.500
(insects chirping)

43:35.375 --> 43:37.125
You'll be all right, okay?

43:37.125 --> 43:39.375
I'm gonna take care of you.

43:41.375 --> 43:43.042
Lay down right here.

43:45.542 --> 43:48.208
- Why are we by the pool?

43:48.208 --> 43:52.167
- We just gotta get away
from those guys for a second.

43:52.167 --> 43:54.917
You need anything?
- No, no.

43:54.917 --> 43:57.333
I'm just gonna sit here.
- Okay.

43:57.333 --> 43:58.667
You let me know.

43:59.542 --> 44:02.708
(anxious piano music)

44:18.125 --> 44:18.958
- Andrew.

44:21.208 --> 44:23.417
Something's not right here.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.083
It's in the air.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.250
- How do you mean?

44:33.750 --> 44:36.917
- I paint because I
had loving parents

44:38.083 --> 44:41.750
who pushed me in the
direction of creativity.

44:43.792 --> 44:45.958
But there was always more.

44:48.583 --> 44:49.417
I dream

44:51.792 --> 44:54.417
and when I dream, I see things.

44:56.208 --> 44:59.500
- What kind of things?
- Horrible things.

45:08.083 --> 45:11.125
I once had a dream that my house

45:11.125 --> 45:14.458
was burning with my
family inside of it.

45:17.833 --> 45:20.250
I woke up to my house ablaze.

45:25.500 --> 45:28.333
I was the only one
able to escape.

45:30.917 --> 45:33.250
I couldn't sleep for months.

45:34.667 --> 45:36.417
- That's terrible.

45:36.417 --> 45:37.833
I'm really sorry.

45:40.125 --> 45:41.792
- I changed my name.

45:43.333 --> 45:45.167
I occupied a new life.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.833
One of purity.

45:48.833 --> 45:52.042
(anxious violin music)

45:57.333 --> 45:58.292
- You know,

45:59.625 --> 46:00.458
your art,

46:02.542 --> 46:04.875
it's so bright and colorful.

46:06.292 --> 46:10.208
I never would've known
you had such a dark past.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.083
- The colors of fire and smoke.

46:20.292 --> 46:23.042
I had a dream
before I came here.

46:25.167 --> 46:26.542
I saw the doctor.

46:29.042 --> 46:30.208
I saw his mask

46:32.042 --> 46:32.875
here.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.208
I don't know what it meant.

46:38.333 --> 46:40.542
I don't know what it means,

46:42.542 --> 46:44.375
but it was unsettling.

46:45.833 --> 46:47.875
- So you've seen him too.

46:49.958 --> 46:51.083
- He wanders.

46:52.917 --> 46:55.500
He's lurking, he's watching us.

46:57.625 --> 46:58.625
- Who is he?

47:00.292 --> 47:02.250
- [Flynn] I don't know.

47:06.250 --> 47:08.500
- Can I ask you a question?

47:10.333 --> 47:11.583
- [Flynn] Yeah.

47:14.583 --> 47:16.417
- You take medication?

47:19.583 --> 47:20.417
- I do.

47:22.750 --> 47:26.167
- You think you should
be drinking on it?

47:27.250 --> 47:28.083
- No.

47:30.375 --> 47:31.208
- Listen,

47:34.375 --> 47:36.792
I don't feel in control here.

47:39.125 --> 47:43.042
- There's no time
for control, Andrew.

47:43.042 --> 47:46.208
(anxious piano music)

48:14.708 --> 48:17.958
(glass clanks)

48:17.958 --> 48:20.292
- Quite the show you put on.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.667
- What are you talking about?

48:34.292 --> 48:36.875
(glass clanks)

48:41.792 --> 48:43.333
I don't understand.

48:45.250 --> 48:49.750
I don't understand what
happens when I'm here tomorrow

48:50.833 --> 48:53.417
and this new project
becomes mine.

48:55.458 --> 48:58.500
- You just gotta
be patient, okay?

48:58.500 --> 49:01.667
(Arthur's fists thud)

49:04.458 --> 49:05.958
- I'm not patient,

49:07.208 --> 49:09.208
I've never been patient.

49:15.708 --> 49:17.042
How do I get it?

49:20.375 --> 49:24.208
- That you gotta find
out for yourself.

49:24.208 --> 49:28.125
The movies you're in are
pretty violent, right?

49:31.042 --> 49:33.500
A lot of training, I presume?

49:36.500 --> 49:38.792
It's funny, the more
real the violence

49:38.792 --> 49:42.458
looks on screen, the
more audiences respond.

49:43.792 --> 49:47.625
It's interesting because
if it were to be real

49:49.083 --> 49:52.750
and an audience just
believed it was staged,

49:52.750 --> 49:57.417
they would applaud, unbeknownst
to its haunting reality.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.583
- You have to be
psychotic to do that.

50:08.708 --> 50:10.958
- The greatest usually are.

50:13.708 --> 50:16.750
(low, anxious tones)

50:34.250 --> 50:37.292
(tense violin tones)

50:45.958 --> 50:48.958
Andrew, sit down
and keep me company.

50:56.625 --> 50:58.208
Where is everybody?

50:59.667 --> 51:03.125
- I think Flynn and
Arthur went to bed

51:03.125 --> 51:05.792
and Nick is resting by the pool.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.792
It's been a long day.

51:09.667 --> 51:11.125
- I would say so.

51:14.833 --> 51:17.042
I've been thinking a lot.

51:17.042 --> 51:20.125
What do you know
about astral travel?

51:21.417 --> 51:22.917
- Astral travel?

51:22.917 --> 51:27.125
- Yeah, like a person
leaving their physical body

51:27.125 --> 51:31.542
and traveling the universe
in any way they so choose.

51:32.667 --> 51:35.083
- I mean I've heard of it but

51:37.917 --> 51:41.458
I don't really
know much about it.

51:41.458 --> 51:43.833
- You know how
there's no evidence,

51:43.833 --> 51:46.958
scientific evidence
of the human soul?

51:48.292 --> 51:51.042
But I think it's so
ignorant to think

51:51.042 --> 51:53.333
we're just here to multiply.

51:55.708 --> 52:00.375
You know, we are the eyes of
the universe watching itself

52:04.208 --> 52:05.375
and sometimes,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.375
you don't like what you find.

52:14.875 --> 52:18.042
You know, I know
what happened to you.

52:19.875 --> 52:20.708
- What?

52:26.417 --> 52:29.625
- I didn't feel comfortable
talking to you about it

52:29.625 --> 52:33.042
but we had a good day
today and I figured

52:34.375 --> 52:37.542
you can tell me a
little bit about it.

52:40.375 --> 52:44.375
How about you take a drink
and tell me about it?

52:47.917 --> 52:49.958
- If you know what
happened to me,

52:49.958 --> 52:53.750
then why would you ask
me if I wanted a drink?

52:55.750 --> 52:59.333
- Take a drink and tell
me about it, Andrew.

53:02.125 --> 53:02.958
- Okay.

53:20.917 --> 53:24.417
So I went down to
Dallas where she worked.

53:27.042 --> 53:30.458
She wanted to introduce
me to her friends

53:32.000 --> 53:32.833
and

53:34.833 --> 53:39.125
so we went out and I was
the one driving that night

53:43.292 --> 53:47.250
and she asked me right
before we got in the car

53:49.667 --> 53:51.625
if I was good to drive.

53:56.500 --> 53:57.667
I said yes

53:57.667 --> 54:01.500
(ominous electronic warbling)

54:02.667 --> 54:05.333
and I put the key
in the ignition.

54:08.542 --> 54:11.875
That was the biggest
mistake of my life.

54:12.792 --> 54:15.000
You know what happens next.

54:17.083 --> 54:18.083
- You killed

54:19.792 --> 54:20.792
your sister.

54:22.417 --> 54:25.333
(Andrew sniffling)

54:39.542 --> 54:40.792
It's all right.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.708
It's all right, I'm
going to sleep now, okay?

54:50.792 --> 54:52.875
Have a good night, Atlas.

55:03.500 --> 55:06.375
(insects chirping)

55:09.417 --> 55:12.583
(anxious piano music)

55:36.917 --> 55:41.917
(Nick splashes)
(tense violin tones)

56:21.250 --> 56:23.500
- We have to call the cops.

56:26.625 --> 56:29.333
- We don't need
to call the cops.

56:31.167 --> 56:32.000
Nick

56:33.167 --> 56:36.583
was a druggie, I found
heroin in his bags.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.125
He was high and he fell into
the pool and he drowned.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.833
He was an artist on the run.

56:47.833 --> 56:49.250
He had no family.

56:50.958 --> 56:55.125
Careers will be ruined if
police were to get involved,

56:55.125 --> 57:00.042
if press were to get involved
and none of us here want that.

57:01.083 --> 57:03.250
This weekend was a secret.

57:05.083 --> 57:06.750
It remains a secret.

57:09.667 --> 57:11.167
It does not exist.

57:13.208 --> 57:16.125
You will all
understand by the end.

57:18.125 --> 57:19.208
Okay, Andrew?

57:22.250 --> 57:23.083
- Okay.

57:24.458 --> 57:25.292
- Arthur?

57:26.333 --> 57:27.167
- Yeah.

57:30.083 --> 57:30.917
- Flynn?

57:33.917 --> 57:34.750
Flynn?

57:36.208 --> 57:37.042
- Yeah.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.208
- There are shovels in the shed.

57:41.208 --> 57:42.208
We bury him.

57:47.167 --> 57:51.167
(tense metallic ensemble music)

58:11.208 --> 58:14.458
(ominous violin music)

58:44.125 --> 58:45.375
Good work, men.

58:46.917 --> 58:49.292
Let's go back to the pool.

58:49.292 --> 58:50.375
Drinks on me.

59:00.958 --> 59:03.917
(shovels clanking)

59:09.125 --> 59:11.375
- What have we done, Flynn?

59:16.125 --> 59:18.000
- [Flynn] Where are we?

59:23.833 --> 59:25.083
Where's Arthur?

59:26.917 --> 59:28.500
- You feeling okay?

59:35.583 --> 59:37.333
- I had another dream

59:38.667 --> 59:39.625
last night.

59:41.875 --> 59:43.875
The one with my parents.

59:48.375 --> 59:51.667
But it was me who
burnt the house down.

59:56.250 --> 59:58.167
That is why I survived.

1:00:01.458 --> 1:00:02.958
- That's not real.

1:00:08.792 --> 1:00:12.792
- [Flynn] I don't know
what's real, Andrew.

1:00:12.792 --> 1:00:14.208
I don't remember.

1:00:31.083 --> 1:00:34.500
(tense metallic music)

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:36.958
(door creaks)

1:02:08.083 --> 1:02:11.833
(heartbeat pounding rapidly)

1:02:54.042 --> 1:02:57.042
(Flynn grunting)

1:02:57.042 --> 1:03:01.875
(tense warbling
electronic, violin tones)

1:03:30.750 --> 1:03:34.042
(ominous violin tones)

1:03:38.750 --> 1:03:39.917
- Who are you?

1:03:41.833 --> 1:03:43.917
What are you doing to us?

1:04:09.625 --> 1:04:14.625
(door creaks)
(tense metallic music)

1:04:50.125 --> 1:04:51.875
Flynn, are you out here?

1:04:51.875 --> 1:04:54.667
Come on man, we
gotta go right now.

1:04:54.667 --> 1:04:55.500
Flynn?

1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.167
(tense warbling
electronic tones)

1:05:02.208 --> 1:05:03.500
Oh shit, Flynn.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:10.958
Arthur, what have you done?

1:05:10.958 --> 1:05:13.875
Don't you know he's
done something to us?

1:05:13.875 --> 1:05:15.542
You're not yourself.

1:05:17.458 --> 1:05:21.542
(tense metallic, warbling music)

1:05:42.125 --> 1:05:44.917
(light tense piano tones)

1:05:44.917 --> 1:05:47.250
(gun cocks)

1:05:50.042 --> 1:05:52.667
(gun clicks)

1:05:52.667 --> 1:05:55.333
(Arthur grunts)

1:06:39.625 --> 1:06:42.583
(gun cocks)

1:06:42.583 --> 1:06:47.583
(classical violin music)
(film reel rattling)

1:07:28.292 --> 1:07:30.458
What the hell is going on?

1:07:32.208 --> 1:07:35.000
- Why don't you
put down the gun?

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.875
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:07:36.875 --> 1:07:39.833
- Hurt me, you're
not gonna hurt me?

1:07:39.833 --> 1:07:41.833
I'll fucking shoot you right now

1:07:41.833 --> 1:07:44.833
if you don't tell
me what's going on.

1:07:44.833 --> 1:07:45.792
- Allow me.

1:07:47.208 --> 1:07:49.458
It's called HEIR,

1:07:49.458 --> 1:07:51.292
H-E-I-R.

1:07:55.500 --> 1:08:00.125
In 1800s France, there was a
man named Josephin Paillat.

1:08:02.708 --> 1:08:06.375
He began an Academy,
one that worshiped art.

1:08:08.375 --> 1:08:11.375
There is spirituality
in what we do.

1:08:13.917 --> 1:08:17.833
Religion will die, but
art will remain forever.

1:08:19.708 --> 1:08:22.416
When churches burn
and temples crumble,

1:08:22.416 --> 1:08:25.875
we will praise in
the concert hall.

1:08:25.875 --> 1:08:29.416
When priests betray
and idols become human,

1:08:32.833 --> 1:08:37.833
we will pray to the ones who
give us stories and songs.

1:08:38.708 --> 1:08:40.291
This is our fate, Andrew.

1:08:41.166 --> 1:08:43.541
- What are you talking about?

1:08:44.708 --> 1:08:47.666
- What many don't know is that

1:08:47.666 --> 1:08:51.666
the Academy is the reason
for pop culture today.

1:08:53.125 --> 1:08:57.833
The most influential artworks
and films have been curated

1:08:59.916 --> 1:09:03.500
in order to choreograph
modern day thought.

1:09:05.208 --> 1:09:07.708
The world has been hypnotized.

1:09:08.583 --> 1:09:09.416
You, here,

1:09:11.416 --> 1:09:13.125
have been hypnotized.

1:09:14.625 --> 1:09:18.916
- So the vial in your
bedroom, that's what that is.

1:09:20.458 --> 1:09:24.375
- Like those who came
before me, I have learned

1:09:25.625 --> 1:09:26.791
about hypnosis

1:09:28.208 --> 1:09:30.000
and I needed a
little extra help.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.083
It's called scipolomi,

1:09:32.083 --> 1:09:35.416
it gives the taker a
sense of obedience.

1:09:37.166 --> 1:09:39.958
I wanted to gather the
greatest creative minds

1:09:39.958 --> 1:09:44.958
at the zenith of their lives
to see what they would do.

1:09:45.875 --> 1:09:47.500
You were the most repellent

1:09:48.333 --> 1:09:49.958
because of your mind,

1:09:49.958 --> 1:09:54.125
you survived because of
the strength of your mind.

1:09:56.291 --> 1:10:00.541
There is no escaping the
hypnosis for the ordinary.

1:10:01.916 --> 1:10:04.125
It's in the films you watch,
in the books you read,

1:10:04.125 --> 1:10:08.291
in the art you're moved
by and the songs you love.

1:10:10.416 --> 1:10:12.958
Some like me just
know how to use it

1:10:12.958 --> 1:10:15.625
to orchestrate it, to create it.

1:10:19.291 --> 1:10:22.541
This script in my
hand is the next link

1:10:24.083 --> 1:10:27.500
in a century-long
chain of true hypnotic,

1:10:29.416 --> 1:10:30.583
spiritual art.

1:10:32.791 --> 1:10:34.041
And it's yours.

1:10:36.041 --> 1:10:38.000
- Why don't you make it?

1:10:38.916 --> 1:10:40.875
- I haven't been chosen.

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:43.875
The Academy

1:10:45.166 --> 1:10:46.000
wants you,

1:10:47.041 --> 1:10:48.000
your vision,

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:50.125
not mine.

1:10:52.750 --> 1:10:55.166
- What is it even about?

1:10:55.166 --> 1:10:57.625
(anxious violin music)

1:10:57.625 --> 1:11:00.291
Tell me, what is the film about?

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:05.166
- It's a beautiful gun
in your hand, isn't it?

1:11:07.041 --> 1:11:07.875
- Yes.

1:11:10.291 --> 1:11:11.125
- Please.

1:11:12.541 --> 1:11:14.458
(anxious piano music)

1:11:14.458 --> 1:11:17.125
(gunshot booms)

1:12:30.791 --> 1:12:33.791
(keyboard clicking)

1:13:29.291 --> 1:13:32.458
(anxious piano music)
