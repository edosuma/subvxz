01:38.840 --> 01:41.753
So, you'll never guess
who turned up yesterday.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.194
Go on.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.715
- Madelyn.
- Madelyn showed up?

01:45.880 --> 01:49.191
Completely out of the blue.
I haven't seen her in 15 years.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.000
And there she was,
standing on the doorstep,

01:52.160 --> 01:53.798
- all gussied up.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.395
And that's a sight
I thought I'd never see again.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.392
What did she want?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.517
20,000 bucks.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.631
Ha-ha-ha! 20,000 bucks?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.952
15 years of back alimony.
I said, "What alimony?

02:06.120 --> 02:08.555
"When we split up, I gave you
whatever money we had,

02:08.720 --> 02:09.994
"and you took the car.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.434
We agreed, that was that."

02:11.600 --> 02:13.193
Geez, not even Mae asked for that,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.198
and she wanted me to pay
for a chauffeur.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.630
It's because our pictures
are plastered all over town.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.837
Probably some lawyer's bright idea.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.991
Well, in any case, I haven't got it.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.760
Myrtle cleaned me out when we split.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.070
You been down to Tijuana?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.470
- Why you ask?
- We had a few days off.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.199
Well, as a matter of fact,

02:31.360 --> 02:33.078
I did take a little trip down there

02:33.240 --> 02:36.471
with Mysterious Montague,
trying to win some back.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.314
Not entirely successfully, unfortunately.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.357
Hey, when is your contract up?

02:41.520 --> 02:43.158
We should ask for a little more money.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.435
A little more? Are you kidding?

02:44.640 --> 02:45.835
Charlie, Buster, Harold,

02:46.000 --> 02:47.877
they get ten times what Hal pays us.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.678
Well, they own their own pictures.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.672
Exactly. That's what we're gonna do.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.114
Hey, boys. How's it going?

02:53.280 --> 02:54.873
Georgie. We're going shark fishing.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.156
Mr. Laurel doesn't know it yet,
but he's the bait.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.950
Now, how are we gonna do that?
We're under contract.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.758
We can't just change the terms.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.276
Well, we stick together,
we renegotiate with Hal,

03:06.440 --> 03:08.158
get a bigger slice of the pie.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.834
If that doesn't work,
then we walk and set up on our own.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.714
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I'd love to own our pictures,

03:13.920 --> 03:15.991
but it just doesn't
seem like the right time.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.514
I've got a lot going on.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.909
This overhead is killing me.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.878
- Hi, Babe. Ha, ha.
- Hello, girls.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.758
Hey, guys, you're wanted on set.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.558
Ah, Burgess, just the man.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.273
Listen, take this to our friend.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.999
Tell him I want it on Bold Venture,

03:28.160 --> 03:29.912
the fourth race at Santa Anita,
on the nose.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.195
There's something in there for you.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.919
Would you do it right away, please?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.151
- It's about to start.
- Okay. Thank you, Mr. Hardy.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.839
You'll be fine, Babe.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.755
Just lay off the horses
and don't get married again.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.957
Oh, I didn't tell you.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.158
- I proposed to Lucille.
- Scripty Lucille?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.311
- Yes.
- Damn.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.118
And she said yes.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.476
Ah. That's great news, Babe.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.392
She needs a head examining, but...

03:54.560 --> 03:57.029
- Ha-ha-ha.
- ...great for you.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.233
Here.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.834
I'm never getting married again.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.752
I'm just gonna find a woman I don't like

04:02.920 --> 04:04.069
and buy her a house.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.833
Ha! That's a good one.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.231
Listen, I can't afford
to fool around with my income,

04:09.400 --> 04:12.597
so don't antagonize Hal,
will you, please?

04:12.760 --> 04:14.751
I don't like to talk about business.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.240
Not when we're working.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.430
I promise I'll be as nice as pie,

04:18.600 --> 04:20.432
- so long as he doesn't show up.
- Heh.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.273
They're ready for us, girls.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.795
What's this? Our rodeos are getting
a lot more interesting.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.430
You know,
I don't miss England one little bit.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.318
- Hello, girls.
- Hi.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.312
- Hello.
- Heh, heh.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.199
Oh, by the way, I've chartered a sailboat

04:35.360 --> 04:36.714
to Catalina this Saturday.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.513
- You want to come?
- Ah...

04:38.680 --> 04:41.672
I gotta work on the gags
for the bar routine.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.919
- Ah, be a lot of nice girls there.
- Yeah?

04:46.080 --> 04:49.675
Miss Myrna Loy will be on board,
among others.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.751
Ah, yeah, well, all right, maybe I'll come.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.911
What are all these Romans doing here?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.435
I don't know.
Maybe there's a sale at the Forum.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.914
You've got a million of 'em, don't you?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.594
Hey, Lucille,
have you got my sides over there?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.876
- Right here, Mr. Horne.
- Thank you.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.474
A sweet for my sweet.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.677
Oh, thank you, Babe.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.351
Listen, let's not talk about leaving.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.511
Let's just try to get ourselves a raise.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.557
- Hey, Jimmie.
- Give you a raise?

05:17.720 --> 05:21.429
He'd rather lower Hollywood,
and that's a Scotsman talking.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.399
- Going for a smoke.
- Heh, heh.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.034
That's it, Stan.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.634
We're through.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.711
I'm throwing the moral clause at you.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.995
Morning, Hal.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.197
Another fight at his place last night.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.795
One of the neighbors sees
Ruthie sock him in the mouth,

05:36.960 --> 05:38.189
so they call the cops.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.959
She found out about Vera.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.794
Yeah, it cost me 500 bucks
to keep it out of the papers,

05:42.960 --> 05:44.712
and that's coming out of your paycheck.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.440
You signed a contract
not to prejudice Hal Roach Studios.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.432
Well, you know all about prejudice.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.829
How's your pal Mussolini,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.513
the one you were going to go
into business with

05:52.680 --> 05:55.399
before he started bombing
all those poor people in Africa?

05:55.560 --> 05:57.153
You see? All he wants to do is fight.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.719
What are you looking for, Stan?

05:58.920 --> 05:59.955
I'm looking for a fair price

06:00.120 --> 06:01.918
for a Laurel and Hardy picture,
and you know it.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.549
Our pictures sell all around the world,
and we haven't got a dime.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.154
That's because
you keep getting divorced!

06:06.320 --> 06:08.470
No, it's because you're a cheapskate
who got rich off our backs.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.114
- Oh, come on, now, Stan.
- He is.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.351
He's a Cheapskate, a skinflint
and a... and a parvenu.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.670
- A parvenu?
- He thinks, because my contract's up

06:14.840 --> 06:17.150
and yours isn't, that I won't be able
to go anyplace else

06:17.320 --> 06:18.833
and I'll have to take what he's offering.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.274
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Mr. Roach?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.914
What's a parvenu?

06:22.080 --> 06:24.037
Well, it's someone
who started out with nothing,

06:24.200 --> 06:25.554
got rich but has no class.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.994
Look it up in the dictionary, Hal.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.719
There's a picture of you.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.598
Oh, you think you're
some sort of smart-ass, huh?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.159
Well, guess what. I'm smarter.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.312
Has he told you yet?
We're setting up on our own.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.311
Hal, it might be best

06:38.480 --> 06:41.199
if you could see your way
to a small raise.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.237
You're setting up on your own, huh?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.913
Well, how about this?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.593
Babe's still under contract with me,

06:46.800 --> 06:48.029
and I ain't releasing him.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.998
You can't have Hardy without Laurel.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.151
Oh, well, that's what you think.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.709
Hal, uh, could you maybe
continue this some other time?

06:54.880 --> 06:57.713
Unless you want to pay
for an extra day, of course.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.757
Go ahead, shoot. Go ahead.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.831
Okay, so we're on
a wide two-shot here, Stan,

07:02.000 --> 07:02.956
just like you wanted.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.474
Then I'm gonna pull back...

07:04.640 --> 07:06.119
- What are you checking with him for?
- Well...

07:06.320 --> 07:07.390
You're the director.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.676
- Direct.
- Ugh.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.472
Next person you'll be hearing from
is my lawyer.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.199
Positions, everyone.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.113
Comedy Western.
Who came up with that smart idea?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.198
Well, that went well.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.636
So, uh, who else is
gonna be on this boat?

07:23.800 --> 07:24.870
Clark Gable, some other people.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.633
- No, no, no. Women.
- Oh.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.478
Carole Lombard.
She's friends with Myrna.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.278
Oh. Okay, I'm gonna come.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.397
- Oh, good.
- All right, show's over.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.358
Let's, uh, roll sound.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.796
- I said roll sound.
- Speed.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.030
Roll camera.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.077
- Ready, boys?
- Quiet, please.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.753
"Way Out West," scene 12, take one.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.319
Oh, what's after the curtseys?

07:43.520 --> 07:45.591
Uh, after the curtseys,
knee bend, then turn and shake.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.034
- Got it.
- Camera set.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.599

09:42.880 --> 09:44.234
- Stanley.
- Well, hello there.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.356
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.710
Welcome to Newcastle.
Wonderful to see you.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.711
How was your journey?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.109
Well, you know, that train trip

09:50.280 --> 09:51.634
sure takes it out of you, doesn't it?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.120
Mm-hm.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.436
Uh, we're delighted
you've taken the trouble

09:55.600 --> 09:57.034
to come and greet us, Mr. Delfont.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.639
Please, call me Bernie.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.632
I want to do everything
I possibly can to make sure

10:00.800 --> 10:02.359
that this tour gets off on the right foot.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.272
Yes, well, that's something
we were hoping to discuss

10:04.440 --> 10:05.839
with you over dinner, actually.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.031
We're a little concerned
that some of the tour dates

10:08.200 --> 10:10.157
are going to be in conflict
with the shooting dates

10:10.320 --> 10:11.674
of this Robin Hood picture we're doing.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.837
I would love to have dinner with you.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.958
Unfortunately,
due at the theater in ten minutes.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.474
- Ah.
- One of my other acts.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.795
Norman Wisdom.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.633
Bright young talent. Blazing.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.440
And we must nurture
the young generation, gentlemen.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.199
I know you both feel as passionately

10:27.360 --> 10:28.589
about that as I do.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.229
- Hmm.
- Anyway, get yourselves settled in.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.113
Charming staff. Charming.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.475
We shall speak anon.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.835
- All righty.
- All right.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.877
- Enjoy the show.
- I shall.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.671
Stan, he does know
we're making a movie, right,

10:45.840 --> 10:47.877
and we're doing this tour
while we're waiting

10:48.080 --> 10:49.434
for things to come together?

10:49.600 --> 10:51.830
Yeah, it's all been spelled out, you know.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.509
All been agreed up front, 110%.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.670
Good.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.230
Where'd you get that?

10:58.400 --> 11:01.438
Uh, it's a... I got it in a shop.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.432
Like a beret, you can fold it up

11:03.640 --> 11:06.598
and stick it in your pocket like that.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.520
Well, here we are.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.234
Well, we'll only be here one night.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.149
Well, three.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.755
Right.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.195
Come on, Stan. Let's get out of the rain.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.159
Good evening, sir.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.392
Now, can't you see
she's standing right there?

12:13.560 --> 12:16.473
You don't need to ring that bell.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.989
Good eve...

12:34.320 --> 12:35.594
That wasn't me.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.879
Please pardon my friend.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.873
You just wait till I tell me mam it's you.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.714
We never get anybody famous
staying here.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.191
To be honest, I thought you'd retired.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.674
- No.No.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.353
No, we're-we're...

12:55.520 --> 12:57.397
we're getting older,
but we're not done yet.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.309
Where are youse
gonna be appearing, then?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.470
The Theatre Royal?

13:02.680 --> 13:03.829
No, it's, uh...

13:04.000 --> 13:05.877
No, it's the Queen's Hall.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.873
Queen's Hall? That can't be right.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.951
All the big stars perform
at the Theatre Royal.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.155
That's where you'll be playing.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.594
Well, I'm sure you're right.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.716
Is it Theatre Royal?

13:14.880 --> 13:16.154
No, it's just the Queen's Hall.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.277
Right, here's your keys.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.800
Thank you.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.190
Now, is there a bellboy?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.189
No-.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.190
All right.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.794
Most of you have realized

13:31.960 --> 13:34.190
it's been a wet and windy day
in Northern England,

13:34.360 --> 13:35.589
as it has been for quite some time...

13:35.760 --> 13:38.991
Oh, uh, my room in ten minutes?

13:39.560 --> 13:41.233
Your room in ten minutes?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.914
Yeah, we've gotta run those lines.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.435
Really?

13:45.600 --> 13:48.069
Sure, we're-we're almost done.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.872
All right. Yeah, I'll be right in.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.310
<i>What's the hotel like?</i>

14:11.480 --> 14:14.950
It's... like a castle.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.833
Well, that's wonderful.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.192
Everyone is so excited
about us touring again

14:20.360 --> 14:22.431
that we're being treated like kings.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.637
Well, Ida and I received our tickets today,

14:24.840 --> 14:26.911
so we're just as excited as can be.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.878
<i>Oh, and so am I.</i>

14:29.040 --> 14:32.999
So, how are things with Stanley?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.833
Well...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.752
you know Stan.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.639
Well, how has he been towards you?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.677
He... he's been good.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.719
It's... it's complicated.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.156
But we're just getting to know
each other again.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.397
It's... it's good.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.471
It's fine.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.509
<i>SCHENCK".
Are you sure Oliver</i>

15:14.720 --> 15:16.711
<i>wants to do this, Stan?</i>

15:22.520 --> 15:23.635
I mean,

15:23.800 --> 15:26.440
Fox would love to have you here, but...

15:28.200 --> 15:30.669
It's what we've both been waiting for, Joe.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.354
I-I can't understand
what's holding him up.

15:33.520 --> 15:37.718
He promised me he was finished
with Hal Roach Studios.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.592
Babe, where have you been?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.518
You had me worried for a minute there.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.034
Ha, ha. What the hell?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.555
You're here now. You're both here now.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.999
Here we are.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.231
Is this gonna be all right?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.994
It's just a movie, Babe.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.550
Mr. Hardy, when you touch her knee
with the mallet,

16:06.720 --> 16:08.757
she'll lift her leg
like you're checking her reflexes.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.433
All right. Thank you.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.113
Want to go for one, you two?

16:14.360 --> 16:16.271
Ready when you are, Ollie.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.958
Going to be great.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.480
Thank you, dear.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.711
You and Harry are
just gonna be great together.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.913
- Roll sound.
- Sound speed.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.639
- Roll camera.
- Camera speed.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.671
Mark it.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.279
"Zenobia," scene 21, take one.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.750
And... action!

16:36.880 --> 16:38.712
Why don't we have Stanley sign?

16:38.880 --> 16:39.836
Then all we have to do

16:40.000 --> 16:41.434
is have Oliver sign when he gets here.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.631
That's-that's a good idea,
right, Joe?

17:04.880 --> 17:06.154
Listen, we need to make sure

17:06.319 --> 17:09.358
we're in a nicer hotel
once the girls get here.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.113
Have you heard from Muffin?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.191
- Miffin.
- Miffin'?

17:13.359 --> 17:16.239
- Is that really his name?
- Mm-hm.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.516
Has he given you our shooting dates yet?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.313
I'm waiting on a call, Ollie.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.949
Hey, what do you think about this
as a title for the movie?

17:23.119 --> 17:24.758
- Hmm?
- "Rob 'Em Good."

17:24.920 --> 17:26.752
As a play on "Robin Hood."

17:26.920 --> 17:28.319
Right.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.352
Yeah, I like it.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.318
I-I've been working on this scene.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.630
Uh, uh, you and I

17:34.800 --> 17:37.030
break into the castle
to rescue Maid Marian.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.949
Right? And we're hiding
from the guards behind a curtain.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.674
Uh, uh, let me show you.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.992
Uh, you're the guard,
and, uh, uh, turn your head away.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.434
Ha-ha-ha. All right.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.078
Okay, so you grab a sword.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.550
Then you try and stab me
through the curtain.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.791
Hold on there. I have to get a sword.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.712
- You see that I'm hiding.
- Yes.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.394
You see by my feet I'm hiding,
so you stab at my head.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.278
Well, you can't hide from me.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.840
- Now what?
- And then you just

18:06.000 --> 18:07.752
grab the drapes
and pull them apart and...

18:13.240 --> 18:15.038
Is that funny?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.835
<i>Why you stay in guest house?</i>

18:21.000 --> 18:22.673
<i>You should be in best hotel.</i>

18:22.840 --> 18:24.672
Beggars can't be choosers, can they?

18:24.840 --> 18:27.275
<i>Okay, then why you not play West End?</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:29.636
No, no, no, no. I don't like this Delfont.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.235
Ida, he booked the tour for us, and we...

18:32.400 --> 18:35.597
we didn't exactly have
too many other offers, now, did we?

18:35.800 --> 18:38.792
And, anyway, we-we have
the movie to look forward to.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.076
<i>I guess the theater's a little small,
but that means</i>

18:41.240 --> 18:42.992
<i>- it'll be easier to sell out.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.</i>

18:43.160 --> 18:45.993
How is Oliver? Hmm? He pulling weight?

18:46.160 --> 18:46.991
He's fine.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.076
Hello?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.832
Stanley!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.035
Hello.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.395
Hello? Ida?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.312
- Stanley.
- Thank goodness for that.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.517
<i>- Thought I 'd lost you.</i>
- Oy.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.717
Honey, I'm-I'm all out of change.
I gotta go.

19:01.880 --> 19:02.950
Okay, you hang up first.

19:03.160 --> 19:03.956
- No, no. You.
- Okay.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.958
On three. One. Two.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.992
<i>- Three. I love you!</i>
- I <i>love</i> you.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.514
Hello?

19:46.640 --> 19:47.960
Hello, Ollie.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.720
I didn't expect to see you here today.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.678
Well, I didn't have
anything better to do...

19:54.240 --> 19:56.038
...so I thought I'd come and see you.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.269
Thank you.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.115
What have you got there?

20:05.280 --> 20:08.352
I brought you some hard-boiled eggs
and some nuts.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.831
Now, you know
I can't eat hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.877
If you wanted to bring me something,

20:15.040 --> 20:16.951
why didn't you bring me a box of candy?

20:17.120 --> 20:20.033
Well, you still haven't paid me
for the last box I brought you.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.951
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.514
Mmm!

21:24.280 --> 21:27.989
What's going on out there
with all those empty seats?

21:30.400 --> 21:31.799
H-How's your knee?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.076
It hurts.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.313
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so very kindly.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.835
We hope you've enjoyed
our little bit of fun here tonight.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.638
We certainly have enjoyed ourselves.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.996
Pretty empty last night.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.111
Pretty empty?

21:54.280 --> 21:56.794
Could have invited
the entire audience back to our hotel,

21:57.000 --> 21:58.832
and there would have been
plenty of room.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.236
Listen, we have to make sure
Muffin doesn't come

22:01.400 --> 22:02.959
until these houses pick up.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.270
We don't want him getting cold feet
about the movie.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.239
Well, then I won't invite him
until we get to London.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.038
All right. You got it?

22:10.200 --> 22:12.999
- Yeah, I got it.
- Here.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.036
What time's our train?

22:15.360 --> 22:16.839
- 8:05.
- What time is it now?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.877
Hold this.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.674
Do we really need that trunk?

22:51.640 --> 22:55.110
How about I just punch you
right on the nose?

22:55.280 --> 22:57.669
I haven't done that for a long time.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.150
Can I poke you in the eye?

23:01.680 --> 23:03.034
You could wring my neck.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.873
I think I'd rather poke you in the eye.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.270
- It's simple.
- Yeah, but if you wring my neck,

23:08.440 --> 23:10.477
I can do that thing with my tongue.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.157
You know, I don't know if my knees

23:17.320 --> 23:19.834
- are gonna hold out for this.
- That's all right.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.270
We'll just finish with a song
instead of the dance.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.078
No, I don't mean the tour.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.119
I mean this scene in the movie
where I fall into the river.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.112
But that's historical, you-you know.
It's famous.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.078
Robin Hood has a fight
on the middle of the log.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.674
We-we gotta do that.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.958
It's a made-up story. Ha-ha.
It's not historical.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.954
All right, look, all I can say is
I'll do the best I can.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.555
Tell you what, I'll have a word
with the producer, Miffin.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.119
I'm sure he can cut round you

23:44.280 --> 23:47.033
when we...
when we shoot the picture.

23:47.440 --> 23:50.080
Maybe I will wring your neck.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.150
Mr. Miffin, please.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.197
It's Stan Laurel.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.956
L-A-U-R-E-L.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.312
That's right.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.279
Oh, that...
well, that's very kind of you to say.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.074
I'm afraid Mr. Hardy's, uh,

24:06.240 --> 24:08.311
indisposed right now.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.233
He's working in a Swiss cheese factory.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.994
He got the job putting the holes in.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.594
S-So, uh, Mr. Miffin?

24:19.840 --> 24:20.910
Is he? All right.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.549
Well, he-he sure does take
a lot of meetings.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.313
It's just that I need to confirm a date

24:25.520 --> 24:28.399
for him to come
and see our show in London.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.313
All right, no, well,
I'll-I'll call again another time.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.198
Thank you.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.712
- How's Ida?
- Oh, she's fine. You know.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.518
She says she's really looking forward

24:44.680 --> 24:46.478
to seeing you and Lucille again.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.472
- Very much.
- Good.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.154
Oh, I... I got you something.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.391
Oh.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.552
Here, hold onto this. Ha-ha.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.595
How do I look?

25:00.760 --> 25:02.034
- You look swell.
- Ha, ha.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.951
We're two peas in a pod.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.519
<i>We just want to know</i>

25:06.680 --> 25:08.637
who's playing Laurel and Hardy, please.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.030
- They're playing themselves.
- Who are?

25:11.200 --> 25:13.396
Laurel and Hardy, here in person.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.710
The poster says,
they're-they're here in person.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.473
But they've been retired for years.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.836
- They're playing themselves.
- Good afternoon, folks.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.399
- Look, Mammy.
- Hello.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.392
Oh, ma'am, I-if you're buying tickets,

25:23.560 --> 25:24.994
tell them you're friends of ours.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.559
He'll charge you extra.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.677
Two seats, front row.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.950
- Hmm.
- Ever had haggis, Oliver?

26:11.120 --> 26:12.519
No-.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.353
Don't.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.671
Now, then, gentlemen,
can I just say, terrific show.

26:18.840 --> 26:19.989
Absolutely terrific.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.480
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Thank you.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.353
- I couldn't be happier.
- Well, let me tell you.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.233
We're going to be working
in some new material.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.674
- Right, Stan?
- Ooh.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.717
Yeah, we have a double-door routine,

26:28.880 --> 26:31.394
um, set in a railway station,
and when Babe's leg is better,

26:31.560 --> 26:32.959
we're going to reintroduce
the dance routine.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.838
Yes, and I think
that will all help enormously.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.560
Double-door routine...
audiences will love that.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.916
How do you feel about
the size of the audiences?

26:40.080 --> 26:42.993
To be honest,
I've been a little disappointed.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.520
And I think it's because of

26:44.680 --> 26:46.717
all these small theaters
we've been playing.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.110
Yes, and I am absolutely furious
about that.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.635
All due respect, Bernard,
you picked them.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.154
Now, I-l don't know what happened

26:53.320 --> 26:54.833
with the larger theaters
we were talking about...

26:55.000 --> 26:57.389
Well, they said they were all booked up.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.392
Yeah, by Norman Wisdom.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.790
Uh, isn't he one of your acts?

27:01.960 --> 27:04.315
Boys, the last thing I want to do
is start canceling shows.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.198
Wait, wait. Who's talking
about canceling shows?

27:06.360 --> 27:07.395
Not me.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.159
Well, we've only been at it a week.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.709
Yeah, wh-when do you plan
to finish this tour?

27:11.880 --> 27:14.110
Well, if we wrap things up
before we get to London,

27:14.280 --> 27:15.873
that would give us
another ten shows or so.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.838
And with a bit of a push, you know,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.399
final shows, that sort of thing,

27:19.560 --> 27:21.597
we should be able to go out with a bang.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.273
- In Hull.
- No. Wait, no.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.839
- Hull?
- We have this movie producer

27:25.000 --> 27:27.389
coming to our show
in London in a month.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.880
- Isn't that right, Stan?
- That's right.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.151
And Ida and Lucille, they're flying over.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.960
We can't finish
the show before London.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.952
- Bernard, we've been clear
- Mm-hm.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.918
That the only reason
we were doing this tour

27:38.080 --> 27:40.435
was so we could pull
that Robin Hood picture together.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.159
- That's right.
- Boys, boys, I know you're peeved,

27:42.320 --> 27:44.630
but could I just say, I am furious.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.393
I mean, they said,
"Oh, people don't come

27:46.600 --> 27:47.920
to the theater anymore."

27:48.080 --> 27:49.559
They said, "They just stay at home

27:49.720 --> 27:51.677
"watching their new television sets,
or they go

27:51.840 --> 27:52.955
"and watch Laurel and Hardy reruns

27:53.120 --> 27:54.679
- at the local picture house."
- We don't get paid

27:54.840 --> 27:56.672
- for those reruns, you know?
- That's what I said,

27:56.840 --> 27:58.194
and then they said, "Could you persuade

27:58.400 --> 27:59.913
"Stan and Ollie to do some publicity

28:00.080 --> 28:01.479
in order to turn the tour around?"

28:01.640 --> 28:03.677
Heh, heh. And I said, "lf you think

28:03.840 --> 28:05.274
"that I'm gonna ask Laurel and Hardy

28:05.440 --> 28:07.272
"to do some publicity stunts,
then you, my friend,

28:07.440 --> 28:09.670
are sorely mistaken."

28:11.680 --> 28:14.479
Hold on. Hold on, now.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.031
We could do that,
couldn't we, Stan?

28:17.200 --> 28:19.430
Sure, if you feel up to it, Babe.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.159
Sure.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.754
It would mean a very large amount

28:22.920 --> 28:24.399
of extra work for you both,

28:24.560 --> 28:26.119
making public appearances,
shop openings,

28:26.280 --> 28:28.476
meeting local dignitaries,
so on and so forth.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.194
- Would there be any more money?
- Ugh. They said no.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.873
Uh, who is "they"?

28:33.040 --> 28:35.156
People. The worst kind.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.391
Wait, I-I thought you were in charge.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.120
Ha-ha. So did I. Heh-heh-heh.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.116
- All right, we'll do it.
- Terrific.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.078
Well, I've told the press
and the newsreel boys

28:49.240 --> 28:51.470
that there'll be a welcoming committee
in Carlisle.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.472
Lord Mayor will be there.
He's desperate to see you.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.711
He is a huge fan.
I'll make some calls.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.638
Delicious.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.871
<i>Nothing new
about a couple of funnymen</i>

29:05.040 --> 29:06.269
<i>making personal appearances.</i>

29:06.440 --> 29:07.839
<i>But when Laurel and Hardy do it,</i>

29:08.000 --> 29:10.560
<i>you can expect complications.</i>

29:11.360 --> 29:13.271
<i>But even at a moment like this,</i>

29:13.480 --> 29:16.313
<i>trouble just seems to follow them around.</i>

30:13.720 --> 30:15.438
Oh!

30:15.600 --> 30:18.160
- What's the matter?
- My head hurts.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.072
I'll get a doctor.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.117
Oh!

30:22.280 --> 30:25.432
Never mind the doctor.
Just get my glass of water.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.431
Oh!

32:14.440 --> 32:15.999
Unbelievable.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.315
It certainly is.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.390
Sorry to bother you, chaps.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.029
Mr. Delfont would like to speak to you.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.840
Uh-oh.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.037
Any last words?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.798
Evening, gentlemen.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.792
If it's, uh, all right with you,

32:43.960 --> 32:45.997
I'd quite like to have
a discussion about...

32:46.160 --> 32:47.753
where we go from here.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.594
Let me guess. Back to America?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.478
Oblivion?

32:53.960 --> 32:56.190
That was...

32:56.560 --> 32:58.597
It was pure magic.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.795
It was brilliant.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.918
And ticket sales have improved
over the last week so much,

33:03.120 --> 33:05.760
mainly due to your efforts,

33:05.960 --> 33:07.792
we've sold out almost everywhere.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.149
Uh, what about London?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.436
Well, not only are we going to London,

33:11.600 --> 33:13.238
but so many people want
to come see the show

33:13.400 --> 33:15.311
that I've had to look for a bigger theater.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.279
So I've, uh... I've booked
the Lyceum for two weeks.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.238
We're guaranteed to sell it out.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.799
That's-that's over 2,000 seats.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.871
- Indeed.
- Heh, heh. Wow.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.269
Do you know, it's moments like this

33:25.480 --> 33:26.800
that make me love this industry.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.030
Madness.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.396
It's beautiful madness. Heh.

33:30.560 --> 33:34.030
And it's not about the money.
It is not about the money.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.310
I swear on...

33:35.480 --> 33:36.879
Well, I swear on both your lives.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.713
Ahem. You both feeling all right'?

33:42.560 --> 33:44.597
That's... that's pretty good, yeah.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.831
- Yeah, leave the jokes to us.
- All right.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.558
Seriously, though,
it's a very special evening.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.838
- Thank you, Bernie.
- Thank you.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.591
Well, that went well.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.194
It certainly did.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.313
So, you're on the log with Robin Hood,

34:18.480 --> 34:20.790
and he asks you what you want
to see him about,

34:20.960 --> 34:22.280
and then you say...

34:22.440 --> 34:24.750
"We're going to give him
a piece of my mind."

34:24.920 --> 34:26.114
"We certainly are."

34:26.280 --> 34:28.112
"We'd give him a piece of his, too,

34:28.280 --> 34:29.918
but he doesn't have any to spare."

34:30.080 --> 34:32.674
Heh, heh. Yeah, that's a nice line.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.114
Have you reached this Muffin fella yet?

34:37.480 --> 34:39.551
I mean,
I'm enjoying how the show's going,

34:39.760 --> 34:42.400
but it's the movie we're doing it for,
isn't it?

34:42.600 --> 34:43.829
Well, that's right, the...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.639
you know, one thing leads to another.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.552
Well, I sure hope so. Heh.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.838
Not exactly spring chickens anymore,
are we?

34:53.000 --> 34:56.197
London terminus, next and final stop.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.391
All change.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.515
Well, here we are.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.513
There it is, the Eiffel Tower.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.029
Ah, here we are.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.029
That's the one.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.634
- Look at that. That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.837
- It's-it's a beautiful piece, sir.
- Hmm.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.634
Mr. Laurel not with you today?

35:59.840 --> 36:03.196
Oh, no, he got himself
a new job mending broken biscuits.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.754
I think it's wonderful you're still going.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.557
Well, rigor mortis has not set in yet.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.358
Sir, he's ready to see you now.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.239
- If you'd like to come along with me...
- Thank you.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.717
Good morning.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.837
Uh, I'm here to see Mr. Miffin.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.317
- And your name, please?
- Uh, Mr. Laurel.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.356
Do you have an appointment,
Mr. Lauren?

36:35.520 --> 36:38.433
Well, no, we keep missing
each other on the telephone,

36:38.600 --> 36:41.069
so I thought if I dropped by,
that'd be the easiest thing.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.151
'Cause he's not here right now.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.155
Well, I can wait.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.957
I think I-I've been speaking
to a different girl on...

36:53.120 --> 36:54.679
on the telephone about this.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.354
Uh, I've been speaking to her
for quite some time.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.511
She's left.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.717
Has she?

37:03.520 --> 37:06.876
You sure you want to wait?
He might be quite a while.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.719
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

37:11.880 --> 37:13.951
Take a seat over there, Mr. Lauren.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.795
- Laurel. <i>- I'll</i>
let his office know that you're here.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.237
There's a gentleman here
says his name's Mr. Lauren.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.958
Right.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.156
You know,
now that I see these two together,

37:43.360 --> 37:44.759
I-I almost prefer this one.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.070
It's our finest bracelet.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.669
My wife is coming in from America today.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.638
It'll be a gift for her.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.110
- 350 pounds.
- Oh.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.914
Let me just double-check something
real quick here.

37:58.080 --> 38:01.994
Uh... do-do-do-do-da.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.750
Ah, yes.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.550
I wonder if you could hold
onto this for me.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.673
I-I seem to have brought
the wrong wallet with me.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.990
So I'll just tootle back to the hotel

38:13.160 --> 38:14.992
and be right back tout de suite.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.275
Of course, sir.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.310
<i>Hello, Raymond?</i>

38:56.520 --> 38:58.875
Well, I was wondering
if you could speak to your man

38:59.040 --> 39:01.077
and-and... and place a bet for me.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.753
Well, I'll tell you.

39:02.920 --> 39:07.391
It's Hometown Boy at Kempton,
the 2:30, five to one.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.959
Um...

39:10.120 --> 39:12.316
let-let's make it 60.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.118
60 pounds on the nose.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.996
Hello? Can I help you?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.151
Sorry. I have asked you to wait.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.879
Please, you're not allowed in there!

39:34.040 --> 39:35.758
Miss Clarke!

39:35.920 --> 39:38.673
Mr. Lauren's in Mr. Miffin's office!

39:42.040 --> 39:43.758
You're here to see Mr. Miffin?

39:43.920 --> 39:46.309
Yes, uh, I'm sorry, uh...

39:46.480 --> 39:47.675
uh, yes, I am.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.753
I'm his production executive,
Cynthia Clarke.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.480
- Hello, Cynthia.
- Oh.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.951
Mr. Miffin is still detained,

39:56.160 --> 39:57.958
but I've just spoken to him
on the telephone,

39:58.160 --> 40:00.515
and he wanted me
to explain the situation to you.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.036
He says he's sorry,
but he's been unable

40:04.200 --> 40:08.114
to raise the finance needed
to proceed with the film.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.591
Oh, I-l see.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.872
He said he made it clear
in a cable he sent to you

40:16.040 --> 40:17.633
before you left the United States

40:17.800 --> 40:21.316
that all the finance wasn't in place.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.392
Yes, well, I thought
he'd have it all lined up by now.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.435
He wanted you to know
that he did everything he could

40:29.600 --> 40:31.318
to bring the project together,

40:31.480 --> 40:33.118
but he feels sure you'll understand

40:33.320 --> 40:35.436
that the market is very challenging
at the moment

40:35.600 --> 40:38.399
and it simply wasn't possible.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.993
Yes, well... thank you.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.436
Uh, thank you for your time.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.954
<i>Get The Sporting Times.</i>

41:21.960 --> 41:23.473
<i>The Sporting Times, please.</i>

41:23.640 --> 41:25.677
There you are. Thank you.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.919
Get "The Sporting Times."

41:47.960 --> 41:51.510
- Bye-bye, now, kids.
- Bye-bye.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.630
- Oh, what's all this here?
- Oh.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.359
- All right, gents.
- Hi, boys.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.397
- Good afternoon, Mr. Hardy.
- Delfont's idea.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.039
He... he thought that the girls arriving

42:10.200 --> 42:12.271
would be a good excuse
for some free publicity.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.475
Ah.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.950
Hmm. I'm really looking forward
to seeing them.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.396
Oh, I've been counting the days.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.359
46. Since we got here.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.840
46 days.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.559
46? Heh, heh.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.757
Who counts from 46?

42:26.920 --> 42:28.149
I was missing her.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.958
Hey, I've been thinking.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.758
We don't need to tell the girls

42:31.920 --> 42:33.319
about everything
we've been doing, do we?

42:33.480 --> 42:34.914
- Um, no.
- I don't want to mention

42:35.080 --> 42:36.957
these personal appearances
and the drinking.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.634
Uh, no, th-there's no sense
in getting them all worked up.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.509
We'll just talk about how well
the tour's going and the movie.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.874
Sure, and the movie.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.709
Hey, if the car pulls up here,

42:48.920 --> 42:50.877
do you think
we could do the door routine?

42:51.040 --> 42:53.509
Heh. You just never stop, do you?

42:53.680 --> 42:55.830
- Ooh, here they are.
- Here they are. Okay.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.196
There she is. Oh...

43:02.040 --> 43:03.633
- Hey, sweetie pie.
- Hello.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.120
Hi, Stan.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.918
Hey, girls, will you
both get out this side?

43:07.080 --> 43:08.514
I've got something I want you to do.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.159
Of course, darling.
I give them my good side.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.674
Oh, no, Stanley, we just got here.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.194
- Come on, girls.
- Oh...

43:13.400 --> 43:15.152
<i>Comedy duo Laurel and Hardy</i>

43:15.360 --> 43:18.512
<i>were joined in London this week
by their wives.</i>

43:18.680 --> 43:20.910
<i>But even in a simple situation like this,</i>

43:21.080 --> 43:24.516
<i>trouble has a habit
of following them around.</i>

43:24.680 --> 43:26.353
<i>Oliver Hardy, Bachelor of Arts,</i>

43:26.520 --> 43:29.751
<i>always seems to have things
under control.</i>

43:30.360 --> 43:34.240
<i>But somehow,
things never quite work out that way.</i>

43:35.520 --> 43:37.477
<i>Yes, they're reunited again,</i>

43:37.640 --> 43:41.838
<i>and now everyone can start
making up for lost time.</i>

43:45.840 --> 43:47.194
Well, I hope they got all that.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.794
It's fine. It'll get a laugh.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.951
Oh, well, I'm awfully glad
about that, boys,

43:51.120 --> 43:53.509
but it would have been nice
to say hello to my husband

43:53.680 --> 43:55.830
without immediately being pressed
into one of your skits.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.798
Oh, Lord. It was just small fun.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.598
Oh, is that what it was, Ida?

43:59.760 --> 44:01.831
Don't be cross, angel.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.832
Who knows?
Maybe you'll get discovered.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.514
They could say,
"She ought to be in pictures."

44:06.680 --> 44:08.159
Heh. No. No, no, no, I don't...

44:08.320 --> 44:10.197
I don't think so, no.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.912
Oliver, can we visit the Tower of London

44:14.080 --> 44:15.150
and Saint Paul's?

44:15.320 --> 44:16.515
- Oh, and Harrods?
- Of course.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.034
Oh, and Buckingham Palace,

44:18.200 --> 44:20.350
where that darling new queen lives.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.796
Of course, angel.
You can visit anywhere you like.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.792
No, no, no,
Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.439
- Oh, this is palace.
- Mm-hm.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.995
The Buckingham is little doghouse.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.878
We have been

44:31.040 --> 44:32.633
counting the days until you got here.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.632
- Oh.
- All 46 of them.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.235
- Did you know it was 46, Stan?
- Heh.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.875
How's the movie coming along, Stanley?

44:41.120 --> 44:42.633
Oh, it's, uh... it's all set up

44:42.800 --> 44:44.552
- for when we finish the tour.
- Oh.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.757
There's this producer fella named Muffin.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.955
Miffin.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.470
And, uh, Stan has rewritten his script.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.392
Oliver, that's enough salt.

44:52.560 --> 44:53.789
You know it's bad
for your blood pressure.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.798
Oh, sorry, angel, just a force of habit.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.479
Anyway, this producer is set to come by

44:57.640 --> 44:59.313
and see the show sometime next week.

44:59.480 --> 45:00.834
Isn't that right, Stan?

45:02.440 --> 45:06.195
Yeah, he said he'd-he'd try
and get along. Mm.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.874
Stan has been
taking wonderful care of me

45:09.040 --> 45:12.351
and making sure
that Daddy takes all of his tablets.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.994
Has he been taking
the blue ones, Stanley?

45:14.160 --> 45:16.436
Blue ones? I... I've been
giving him green ones.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.114
Green? Oh, my goodness.
Oliver, what are they?

45:19.320 --> 45:20.640
- He's kidding.
- Heh, heh, heh.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.199
Well, I'm not finding that funny.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.676
- I was dancer. Yes?
- Oh.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.478
I dance for Preston Sturges.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.597
- I dance for Harold Lloyd.
- Really, Ida?

45:28.760 --> 45:30.114
You've never mentioned this before.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.840
When my knee hurt,
what I do, hmm?

45:33.040 --> 45:35.031
I dance some more, yes?

45:35.200 --> 45:38.591
I go faster, I jump high,
and hurt go away.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.592
- Oh. Mm.
- Hmm? I forget pain,

45:40.800 --> 45:43.314
because pain is only in your mind, Oliver.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.278
It's not in his mind, Ida.
It's in his knee.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.636
And there's no way that you can do
the scene in this movie

45:47.800 --> 45:49.199
where you fall into the river.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.636
- I've been telling her about the script.
- Oh.

45:51.800 --> 45:55.191
- Director can use double.
- That's what I told her.

45:55.360 --> 45:56.634
- Sturges use double.
- It's okay

45:56.800 --> 45:58.029
for Babe to sit about in a river all day,

45:58.200 --> 45:59.270
is it, catching his death of cold?

45:59.480 --> 46:00.515
Honestly, Stanley, come on.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.239
Why you say Stanley?

46:02.440 --> 46:03.714
- What?
- What?

46:03.880 --> 46:06.599
Anyway, show must go on, yes?

46:06.760 --> 46:07.875
And don't worry about river jump.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.758
It's easy as cake.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.196
- Easy as pie.
- Yeah, it's-it's a piece of cake.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.237
That's what I say.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.834
What do you see
in a fat old man like me'?

46:19.040 --> 46:22.999
Hey, you, that's my husband
you're talking about.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.200
I love you, and you can't stop me.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.075
- Well, all right.
- Mmm.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.917
How was the trip over with Ida?

46:40.080 --> 46:42.356
Oh, you know Ida. Exhausting.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.431
When she gets something in her head,

46:44.600 --> 46:47.513
she won't let it go
till she's worried it to death,

46:47.680 --> 46:49.398
and God forbid anyone should raise

46:49.560 --> 46:51.278
the slightest criticism of Stanley.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.272
Heh, heh. She's a real piece of work.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.078
Yeah.

46:55.920 --> 46:58.719
Has he been pushing you
a little too hard, Babe?

46:58.880 --> 47:00.518
No-.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.591
I mean, it is a bit more difficult

47:04.800 --> 47:08.350
than I thought it might be, but...

47:09.560 --> 47:11.915
the show must go on.

47:18.400 --> 47:22.109
I think she wear pants
in Hardy house, no?

47:22.280 --> 47:26.114
Oliver is like cat
on hot roof with Lucille.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.879
Babe's been like that with all his wives.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.360
He runs round after them,

47:29.520 --> 47:31.193
jumping up and down,
trying to please them.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.873
Oh, you can learn this?

47:34.240 --> 47:36.038
She's been good for him,

47:36.200 --> 47:38.430
considering the state he was in.

47:38.600 --> 47:40.796
The state we were both in.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.396
But now we don't drink
and we don't smoke,

47:46.560 --> 47:49.154
and we're very happy-

47:49.800 --> 47:52.952
He should say thank you to you
for all you do for him.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.909
You could have long time ago said,
"Goodbye, Oliver."

47:57.080 --> 48:01.153
That's all in the past,
and it's where it should stay.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.032
Thank you.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.919
You crazy. Send it back.

48:06.080 --> 48:07.673
I don't want to drink it.
I just want to smell it.

48:07.840 --> 48:09.160
No, it's bad for diabetes.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.839
No-.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.791
Now you can't drink.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.318
I don't want to lose you, Stanley.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.713
Mmm.

48:36.920 --> 48:40.675
And to think nobody knows
that you're really a man.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.634
Would you like me to arrange
you tickets for Norman Wisdom?

49:06.800 --> 49:08.154
Oh, I don't know who that is.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.072
Oh, one of the comic minds
of our generation.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.469
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

49:11.640 --> 49:12.869
<i>- I'll</i> speak to Oliver.
- Absolutely.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.519
- Yea high, cap. After you.
- Thank you. Oh.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.994
- Mm-mm. No, no, no. No, no.
- What?

49:16.160 --> 49:17.673
No, I don't want to sit next to him.

49:17.840 --> 49:18.989
- Hello. Hello.
- Evening.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.156
Sold out. Wonderful.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.833
Huge box office.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.389
- Who?
- They sold a lot of tickets, Ida.

52:05.360 --> 52:07.078
I wonder when the boys will be up.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.754
Why don't you ask someone
to go get them, hmm?

52:09.920 --> 52:11.479
Well, he seems a little preoccupied

52:11.640 --> 52:13.074
with his fancy friends.

52:13.240 --> 52:15.072
Come, we stand like lemon, huh?

52:15.240 --> 52:16.514
Oh, Ida.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.474
Hello.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.358
Ladies, I was just on my way over.

52:21.520 --> 52:22.794
Mrs. Laurel and Mrs. Hardy,

52:22.960 --> 52:24.359
may I introduce Lord and Lady Warley

52:24.520 --> 52:25.510
and Mr. and Mrs. Brockett-Smith.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.114
- Hello.
- Good evening.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.873
Such a wonderful reception,
isn't it, Ida?

52:29.080 --> 52:31.390
- It's okay.
- Did you enjoy the show?

52:31.560 --> 52:34.279
Oh, yes, very good.
Stuff and nonsense, wasn't it?

52:34.440 --> 52:36.511
Well, Mr. Delfont, he told us that...

52:36.680 --> 52:39.559
I have many offer
to perform on London stage,

52:39.760 --> 52:41.558
but Hollywood call me.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.274
Oh, so you're a bit
of an actress yourself, are you?

52:44.440 --> 52:47.478
More of a dancer, really,
with a very high pain threshold.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.718
I make film with, uh,
Preston Sturges and, urn...

52:50.880 --> 52:51.995
- Harold Lloyd.
- Harold Lloyd.

52:52.160 --> 52:53.434
No time for London stage.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.273
No, and I'm sure the London stage

52:55.480 --> 52:57.232
has been kicking itself all these years.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.716
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.153
We have to find our boys.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.839
Excuse me.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.551
Two double acts for the price of one.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.634
This line that Robin Hood has

53:09.800 --> 53:11.871
about stealing from the rich
and giving to the poor,

53:12.080 --> 53:13.878
th-there's a gag there somewhere,
isn't there?

53:14.080 --> 53:16.196
Babe, the girls are gonna be waiting
for us downstairs.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.476
Delfont wants us to meet
these people from his charity.

53:18.640 --> 53:21.109
No, never mind about them.
They're not going anywhere.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.840
We just need to work through this
just a little bit more.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.469
Hey, when is Muffin coming
to see the show?

53:28.040 --> 53:29.269
He didn't say.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.670
He should have been here tonight.
Went big tonight.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.194
That was a crackerjack, wasn't it?

53:33.360 --> 53:34.680
- Ha, ha, ha.
- It was.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.751
All right, all right, how-how about this?

53:36.920 --> 53:40.800
How about we tell Robin Hood,
"You've got it all wrong.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.758
"You ought to steal from the poor

53:42.920 --> 53:44.752
- and give it to the rich."
- No, no, that's not...

53:44.920 --> 53:46.479
- Something like that.
- That's not right, it's...

53:46.640 --> 53:48.153
- Well, what is it?
- Well, all-all right, okay.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.390
- You got something...
- How about...

53:49.560 --> 53:51.073
Okay, how about this?
Okay, I tap you

53:51.240 --> 53:53.629
on the shoulder, and I say, uh, uh...

53:53.800 --> 53:55.234
"Ollie, I got an idea.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.391
"How about we-we give to the poor

53:57.560 --> 53:59.915
"by stealing from the poor?

54:00.080 --> 54:01.673
That way, we cut out the middleman."

54:01.880 --> 54:03.029
That's it.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.793
- Ha. That's it.
- All right.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.759
Stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.991
Whoever heard
of such a ridiculous idea?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.753
Well, it's communism.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.672
Stanley,
he is not gonna fall into that river.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.478
The script says I fall in the river,

54:15.640 --> 54:17.119
- that's what I have to do.
- No, Oliver.

54:17.280 --> 54:19.032
- It's historical, right, Stan?
- It is, yes.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.918
I can't believe we have to see
all these people.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.195
I just want to take a bath.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.754
Yeah, I want you to take a bath.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.558
- Heh, heh.
- Ah.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.994
There you are.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.350
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Stan Laurel

54:29.520 --> 54:31.557
and Mr. Oliver Hardy.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.640
No-.

54:35.800 --> 54:37.120
- Yeah?
- No, I-l don't want any.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.156
- Oh.
- Thank you, no.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.594
I got a great thing going here.

54:39.760 --> 54:41.558
The... the more I drink,
the drunker she gets.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.913
- Do loosen up, angel.
- Yes, loosen.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.071
This movie could be big break for boys.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.151
Oh, please. A big break?

54:50.320 --> 54:52.072
Oliver is 61 years old.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.958
- He's made 150 films, Ida.
- Shh.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.713
Please tell me, how can they be

54:55.880 --> 54:58.030
a matter of weeks away
from making this movie, Stanley,

54:58.200 --> 54:59.952
and still not have
any shooting dates confirmed?

55:00.120 --> 55:02.714
I mean, this is just such
a ridiculous situation.

55:02.880 --> 55:03.950
It may be ridiculous,

55:04.120 --> 55:05.269
but situation's not Stanley's fault.

55:05.440 --> 55:06.635
- Honey, that's the...
- What?

55:06.800 --> 55:08.313
Please, w-we're here to have a nice time.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.312
Well, whose fault is it, then, Ida?

55:10.480 --> 55:12.039
- What are you trying to insinuate?
- Oh, come on, now.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.356
No. No, no, no.
I'd like to know how this nutty tour...

55:14.520 --> 55:16.397
which, let's face it,
they're doing for the money...

55:16.560 --> 55:18.278
has anything to do with Oliver.

55:21.160 --> 55:24.198
Because Oliver make elephant film.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.275
What?

55:27.320 --> 55:28.594
- Gentlemen.
- What?

55:28.800 --> 55:30.950
May I present two huge fans of yours,

55:31.120 --> 55:32.997
Lord Angus and Lady Mary Warley.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.197
Ladies, I'm being the most terrible host.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.556
Shall we sample the delights
of the buffet?

55:37.720 --> 55:40.280
My wife loves your films.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.596
I-I don't really watch them myself.

55:42.760 --> 55:44.114
I remember one about a piano.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.191
You two had to push it up some stairs.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.913
Have you seen that one?

55:48.080 --> 55:50.230
- No.
- Oh, it's very good.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.357
They had to push this piano
up to the top of the stairs,

55:52.520 --> 55:53.840
and it was a long way, hmm?

55:54.000 --> 55:55.957
And you got it up to the top of the stairs,

55:56.160 --> 55:57.719
and the bloody thing came sliding

55:57.880 --> 55:59.757
- all the way down to the bottom again.
- Hmm, hmm.

55:59.960 --> 56:02.270
And you two had to push it
all the way back up.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.158
- I know. I was there.
- And would you believe,

56:04.320 --> 56:06.038
it only rolled all the way down again.

56:06.200 --> 56:09.909
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Yes, that's what happened.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.233
Was the piano damaged?

56:12.400 --> 56:13.913
- It was a prop.
- No, it was a...

56:14.080 --> 56:15.832
Would you please excuse us
for a moment?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.230
- Oh.
- J-Just one moment.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.670
- That was painful.
- Yeah.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.593
What was that Ida just said
about the elephant film?

56:24.760 --> 56:26.671
You're not still carrying that around,
are you?

56:26.840 --> 56:28.751
No, it was just... you know, I like to

56:28.920 --> 56:30.672
let off steam now and again, but she's...

56:30.840 --> 56:33.229
she didn't know what she was saying.

56:34.840 --> 56:36.592
You think this is all my fault

56:36.760 --> 56:38.671
because I went ahead
and did a picture

56:38.840 --> 56:40.239
with someone else 16 years ago?

56:40.400 --> 56:41.515
Is that what you think?

56:42.520 --> 56:43.794
You weren't there anymore.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.469
- You left the studio.
- I was fired.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.917
Because you were
a pain in the ass, Stan.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.230
You refused to negotiate with Hal.

56:52.400 --> 56:53.754
I was still under contract,

56:53.920 --> 56:55.797
so I had to do that picture without you.

56:55.960 --> 56:59.430
Well, that's, uh...
that's not how I see it.

57:00.400 --> 57:02.755
And how do you see it, Stan?

57:02.920 --> 57:05.150
Well, if we're laying
all our cards on the table,

57:05.320 --> 57:07.596
the-the only reason
we're in this situation now

57:07.760 --> 57:10.718
is because when I was trying
to get a better deal from Hal,

57:10.880 --> 57:12.154
you were nowhere to be seen.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.590
I had no choice, and you know it.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.592
- I was broke.
- You had a choice.

57:16.760 --> 57:19.718
You chose to be down
at the-the country club or the racetrack.

57:19.880 --> 57:22.076
We had a good thing going with Hal,

57:22.240 --> 57:24.356
but you had this big chip
on your shoulder

57:24.520 --> 57:26.511
because you weren't
being treated like Chaplin.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.069
You're damn right.
And you didn't have the guts

57:29.240 --> 57:31.231
to ask for the deal that we deserved.

57:31.400 --> 57:33.073
I'm getting a drink.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.072
But, look, Ida, I don't want to fight.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.958
I just want to do what's best for Babe.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.236
- Oliver agreed to tour, no?
- Well, yes, he did. He did.

57:39.400 --> 57:40.674
Okay, so life is not easy.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.558
It never ever come on dinner plate.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.870
Are you implying
that Oliver and I aren't hard-working?

57:45.040 --> 57:46.474
You live in Hollywood.

57:46.640 --> 57:48.119
- So do you and Stan.
- No, no, no, no, no.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.954
I may live in Hollywood,
but I am not Hollywood.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.509
Ida, you are the epitome of Hollywood.

57:53.680 --> 57:56.194
- Don't you pity me.
- What? Oh.

57:56.360 --> 57:58.158
I work my entire life to get where I am.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.834
- Well, hey, I had a job.
- Yeah, poo-poo, script lady.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.354
Well, how's your
acting career these days?

58:02.520 --> 58:03.351
- No.
- Yes.

58:03.520 --> 58:04.874
If you're accusing me

58:05.080 --> 58:07.913
of trying to get along with people,
well, then I'm guilty.

58:08.080 --> 58:10.720
I'm an actor. I do like people to like me.

58:10.920 --> 58:12.274
I want people to hire me.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.397
Sure, you wouldn't say "boo" to a goose.

58:14.560 --> 58:15.959
Everybody loves Babe.

58:16.120 --> 58:18.191
Come and play a round with Babe.

58:18.360 --> 58:21.079
While I'm sleeping on a couch
in the editing suite.

58:21.240 --> 58:22.878
Well, that's how you wanted it.

58:23.040 --> 58:25.190
You cared about those things. I didn't.

58:25.360 --> 58:26.953
Well, you can't have, or you wouldn't

58:27.120 --> 58:28.758
have gone off to work
with somebody else.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.514
L-I couldn't sleep for days
when they told me what you did.

58:32.680 --> 58:34.671
And I couldn't sleep when I did it.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.670
But you Still did it.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.918
You betrayed me,
betrayed our friendship.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.918
Friendship?

58:45.120 --> 58:47.873
We're friends
because Hal Roach put us together,

58:48.080 --> 58:49.991
and the only reason we stayed together

58:50.160 --> 58:51.912
was because the audience wanted it.

58:53.040 --> 58:54.997
I have real friends.

58:55.160 --> 58:58.835
And yes, we play golf,
and we go to ball games,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.753
and we have sauerkraut
on our bratwurst.

59:01.920 --> 59:04.070
People will remember our movies

59:04.240 --> 59:07.312
long after you've finished your hot dog.

59:07.520 --> 59:09.591
You know something,
you're just a lazy ass

59:09.760 --> 59:11.876
who got lucky 'cause you met me.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.360
Lucky?

59:13.520 --> 59:15.636
To spend my life with a hollow man

59:15.800 --> 59:17.871
who hides behind his typewriter?

59:18.680 --> 59:21.149
You're not real, Stan.

59:21.320 --> 59:24.836
You're hollow. You're empty.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.916
I loved us.

59:32.680 --> 59:37.675
You loved Laurel and Hardy,
but you never loved me.

59:40.400 --> 59:42.152
So what?

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.312
Bravo!

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.151
Was that funny?

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.710
What are you gonna say to him?

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.278
Nothing.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.553
There's nothing to say.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.633
Oliver, I would go
to the ends of the earth for you,

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.474
I would do anything for you,
but I won't stand by

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.634
and watch this lifestyle of yours
put you in a wooden box.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.874
There, I've said it.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.435
I'm sorry, but it's true.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.877
You know what?

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.400
You're absolutely right.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.714
Just as soon as we're finished up here,

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.076
that's it.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.436
I'm through with him.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.916
Once and for all.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.591
Oh, Babe.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.439
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- Shh. Oh, Babe.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.030
Good morning.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.077
Your taxi's outside, Mr. Laurel.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.992
Have you seen Mr. Hardy at all?

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.276
He left about 15 minutes ago, sir.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.673
Thank you.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.673
There you are.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.712
Morning.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.713
Welcome to Worthing, gentlemen.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.110
- Can I get you anything?
- If you don't mind,

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.231
I would love a cup of tea, please.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.834
- Of course.
- I'll do it.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.354
I'd rather you made my cup of tea,

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.999
if that's all right.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.510
- Of course.
- Thank you.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.796
Um, how do you take it?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.389
Milk, four sugars.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.840
Milk and four sugars, please.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.559
Of course.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.955
Ahh.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.754
Thank you very kindly.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.720
Well, I think it's amazing

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.871
that you two are still going strong,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.600
still using the same old material.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.274
Uh, I, uh, wanted to tell you something.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.875
So, I was talking to this fella
about, uh... about eggs.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.519
I know you like your eggs.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.591
And, uh, he said they get a powder

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.871
to supplement the government ration.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.078
You get a packet a month,
same as a dozen eggs.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.516
Doesn't taste too good, but, uh,

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.234
you can make an omelet with it.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.315
That's what he said.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.160
Stan, I have nothing to say.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.870
Well, I've got nothing to say to you, too.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.678
And you can ignore what I just said,

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.955
because I won't be repeating it.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.236
Right. Enough bits.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.039
Ah, forget it.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.231
To present the crown

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.711
to the winner
of the Bathing Beauty Contest,

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.838
Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.639
Thank you. Aren't-aren't they...

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.319
aren't they beautiful?

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.835
Ladies and gentlemen, uh,
Mr. Hardy and myself

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.959
would like to thank you
for such a warm, warm welcome

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.350
we've received here
from everyone in-in Worthing,

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.756
our favorite seaside town.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.957
And, uh, really,
I-I suppose all that remains

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.317
is for me to put this lovely tiara crown

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.357
on our beautiful winner.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.399
Will you... will you quit sulking
and get up here?

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.880
And the winner...

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.313
Babe, you're not...
Babe, Babe, what happened?

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.515
You all right?

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.432
What's going on?
What's going on, buddy?

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.432
Uh, someone turned out the lights.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.834
Talk to me.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.798
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.991
This is so stupid.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.071
- Okay.
- Here, 430.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.430
Lucille?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.113
I've got my key here somewhere.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.719
He had-had a funny turn.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.279
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.919
Well, we were about to go onstage,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.479
and he said he wasn't feeling well,

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.074
and he sort of collapsed.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.833
Collapsed? No, I need
to get a doctor right now.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.235
No doctor.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.118
I got him here as fast as I could.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.556
You should have taken him to the hospital.
Look at the state he's in.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.869
- I tried.
- Yes, hello.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.519
This is Mrs. Hardy in room 430.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.512
Now, I need a doctor to attend

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.273
to my husband right away, please.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.317
- Mr. Oliver Hardy.
- Don't worry, I'm fine.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.595
My goodness, please hurry up.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.995
I'm so sorry, Lucille.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.992
Thank you, Stan. I'll take it from here.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.992
It's fine. Don't worry. You hang up.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.673
Goodness, why are they taking so long?

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.150
- Hang up.
- Oh, my goodness, please hurry up.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.438
Yes, I already told you...

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.471
Lucille won't let anybody near him.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.754
We can't expect him back anytime soon?

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.873
- I-I don't think so.
- Oh, shame.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.031
The advance London bookings
are very strong.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.713
Everyone wants to see you.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.996
<i>Shows a huge success.</i>

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.790
It's not Babe's fault that he got sick.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.713
No, of course not. Of course not.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.959
Stanley, am I right in thinking

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.952
that before you teamed up with Oliver,

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.679
you used to work with other partners?

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.590
Well, yes, when I was in vaudeville,

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.592
I-I worked with lots of different partners.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.639
Um... of course, Charlie Chaplin was one.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.279
- Mm.
- But th-these were very fleeting...

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.272
And, of course,
Oliver made his elephant film

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:05.510
with a different partner.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.472
Well, what's that got to do with anything?

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.199
Oh, I don't know.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.351
Random thought. Heh.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.439
There's a, um... there's a very popular

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.273
double act here called Cook and Baker.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.238
Cook is basically Hardy to Baker's Laurel,

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.799
if you see what I mean.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.839
And I was just wondering
whether you might consider

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.513
doing a couple of shows
with Nobby Cook,

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.712
just to keep the seats full
until Oliver can return.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.871
Go on without Babe?

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.835
Well, something to mull over, anyway.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:43.231
After all, those sausages don't pay
for themselves.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.473
Hi, Stan.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.159
Please don't tire him out.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.555
Hello, Ollie.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:30.078
I didn't expect to see you here today.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:39.477
I got you something.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.470
Eggs?

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.638
- Laid 'em myself.
- Heh, heh.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.350
I had to go down to the kitchen
to see if they had any spare.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.710
Three shillings each, they cost me.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.712
Thank you, Stan.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.316
I'll have one now, if I may.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:01.913
Sure.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.319
You know, Lucille didn't have to go.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:08.515
She could have stayed.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.318
I mean, that-that argument we had

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.595
the other night,
that was just... it was so silly.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.636
It was... it was a-about nothing.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.631
Just"

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.631
just nothing.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.950
Babe, I-l wanted to talk to you...

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.712
I'm retiring.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.278
What?

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.520
The doctors told me
I can't continue with the tour,

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.991
and I have promised Lucille I won't.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.033
So I'm retiring, Stan.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.430
I've promised Lucille, and that's that.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.750
I'm sorry.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.749
I should never have had us take this tour.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.719
<i>Well, je ne regrette rien.</i>

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.109
And you shouldn't <i>regrette</i> rien, either.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.109
Can't you just rest until you're better,

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.954
and then, you know,
we could start again?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.236
They say my heart won't take it.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.035
So I'm going home

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.991
just as soon as we can arrange
the crossing.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.191
You're retiring.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.559
- Oh.
- Yes.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.599
Retiring.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.517
So, what have you been working on?

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.671
- What?
- What new scenes for the movie

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.917
- have you been working on?
- Oh.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.199
Nothing, really.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.431
I haven't seen you for two days,

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.631
and you're trying to tell me
you haven't been working

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.791
- on new material in that time?
- Ha, ha.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.520
Well...

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.478
Come on, then, out with it.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.075
Well, I did have this idea
for a... a romantic scene

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.958
where you're pining for Maid Marian,

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.953
but she's holed up in a castle
with the Sheriff of Nottingham.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.110
Right.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.630
And then we hear
this very sad violin music,

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.871
and you start to cry;
you can't handle it.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.118
And, uh, of course, you're...
you're bawling your eyes out,

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.509
the tears are bouncing off your cheeks,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.193
but I'm not upset at all, you know,

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.759
and I-l don't know what to do.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.598
- I'm...
- Ha, ha, ha.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.559
And, uh... and-and then suddenly,

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.398
I-I think, "Oh, I know.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.914
"I'll-I'll get this potted plant,

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.673
and I'll put it underneath you."

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.353
- Ha, ha.
- You know, so at least...

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.591
at least there'll be something
to catch the tears

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.398
and give the plant... plant a watering.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.831
But then the plant just starts
growing like crazy, you know.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.750
I'll get the prop boys
to rig me up the tears

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.240
so they're like little waterfalls.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.999
- That's right.
- That'll be a riot.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.515
That'll... that's great, Stan.
That'll go big.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.270
Would you do me a favor?

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.999
Will you pull this blanket up on me?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.231
- Sure.
- I just can't seem to get warm.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.797
My goodness, your hands are like ice.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.110
- Yeah.
- Here.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.234
That better?

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.073
Yes.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.914
So, have you talked to Delfont?

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.391
I spoke to him this morning.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.312
What did he say?

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.313
Well, he... he didn't know
you were retiring, of course,

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.711
but he asked me, since you were sick,

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.793
if I wouldn't mind carrying on
the show with somebody else.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.437
<i>Who'?</i>

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.672
An English comedian called Nobby Cook.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.390
Well, that makes sense.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.590
It's for the best, Stan.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.192
Maybe it is.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.878
Well, that's settled, then.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.671
I'm retiring, and you're going on
with a new partner.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.759
Hmm.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.558
Yes.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.558
That's it.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.074
The other night, uh,
those things you said...

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.195
did you mean them?

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.038
No-.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.875
<i>DR! you'?</i>

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.713
No.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.992
Good.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.917
Stanley, may I introduce to you
Mr. Nobby Cook,

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.157
one of our finest music hall comedians.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.038
Very pleased to meet you, Nobby.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.032
I've heard a lot of great things about you.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.555
Mr. Laurel, I'm a big fan of yours.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.870
- I've seen all your films.
- Oh, we'll have none of that.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.360
You're Nobby. I'm Stanley.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.113
I'm looking forward
to rolling my sleeves up

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.510
- and getting to work with you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.472
It's very nice of you to say so.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.956
Heh, heh. You two are gonna be
absolutely terrific together.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.952
Wonderful rapport. I'm laughing already.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.519
Dare we attempt a run-through?

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.512
If you like. I-l mean, it's up to Stan.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.875
Well, I can go off, come on again

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.156
- and take it from the top.
- That'll be great.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.317
Good idea.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.952
Belting, this, Stan, eh'?

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.236
Ha-ha-ha. Guaranteed laughs.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.437
What have you got there?

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.439
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts?

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.831
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts?
Don't be so daft.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.320
- What's the matter with you?
- Ha, ha.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.834
I can't eat that.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.958
Okay, and cue Stanley.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.716
Isn't this so much nicer, Babe?

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.110
All the worry gone.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.634
Just you and I relaxing together.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.474
I spoke to Mother today,
and she passes on her love.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.074
<i>And what, pray you,</i>

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.635
<i>has Robin Hood done
to inspire such wrath?</i>

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.757
<i>Well, we've heard that he steals</i>

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.480
<i>from the poor to give to the rich.</i>

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.314
- lsn't that right, Stan?
- It certainly is.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.198
He's got the whole thing
the wrong way round.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.634
Exactly.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.031
Our idea, you see, is to give to the poor

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.873
by stealing from the poor,

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.111
<i>thereby cutting out the middleman.</i>

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.590
<i>And the rich need never be any the wiser.</i>

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.677
<i>- Precisely.
- Hmm.</i>

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.233
- Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.591
Here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.555
Mm!

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.671
How's that for you, Mr. Cook?

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.917
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.753
please take your seats,
as tonight's performance

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.957
with Mr. Stan Laurel and Mr. Nobby Cook

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.554
is about to commence.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.994
Laurel and Cook.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.151
Enormously exciting.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.789
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.230
I'm afraid that, due to circumstances

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.233
beyond our control,
tonight's performance

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.311
has been canceled.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.990
Canceled?

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.959
What's going on?

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.358
Tickets can be
redeemed at the box office.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.517
Redeemed?

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.633
You know, when you watch our movies,

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.792
nobody else in the stories knows us,

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.040
and we don't know anybody, either.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.750
It was just the two of us.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.230
All we had was each other.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.160
It was just the way we wanted it.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.836
I love him, Ida.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.837
We go home?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.193
Don't tell Babe.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.240
Tell him I'm going to continue
with the dates in Ireland.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.233
It would upset him to think
about me canceling the tour.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.712
The doctor thinks
you should be well enough

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.269
to travel tomorrow, which is wonderful.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.278
Now, I'm gonna go down
and see if there's any mail,

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.118
and then the Laurels will be stopping by

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.033
to say goodbye
before they go to Ireland.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.032
I do hope it's not gonna rain today.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.679
When that wind gets up,

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.912
the chill cuts right through to the bone.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.154
I won't be long, Babe.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.914
- Hurry back.
- Yeah. Mm.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.677
<i>Mr. Hardy, I believe you suffered</i>

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.070
- a mild heart attack today.
- Oh.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:39.950
I also believe there is some evidence
of congestive failure.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.157
LUCILLE
Oh, dear God, I knew it.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.834
<i>Well, I think it's amazing</i>

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.752
that you two are still going strong.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.877
I think it's wonderful you're still going.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.633
All me family love your films.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.632
<i>I</i> suggest you go home

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.030
<i>as soon as you possibly can
to seek specialist treatment.</i>

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.390
<i>You just wait till I tell me mam it's you.</i>

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.710
<i>My wife loves your films.</i>

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.236
You cannot possibly go onstage again

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.835
in your current condition.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.677
One of the bellboys down there...

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.116
Raymond, I think his name was...
said to tell you

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.794
he had a good tip for you on a horse.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.510
Have you been gambling, Oliver Hardy?

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.358
Oliver.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.798
Darling, you have money for bellboy?

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.950
Sure.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.074
Answer, please. I powder nose.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.397
And give him five shillings only, no more.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.160
I'm only supposed to give you
a couple of...

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.798
You're not leaving, are you, Stan?

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.080
We've got some shows to do.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.953
I think we should all get below now,
out of this cold.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.474
Darling, I agree.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.314
Oliver, will you at least listen to me
about this?

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.154
Or are you determined
to catch pneumonia?

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.038
I'm enjoying the fresh air, honey.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.395
Really?

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.035
Stan, why don't you come sit here?

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.639
You girls go ahead if you're cold.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.438
All right.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.478
Come on, Ida.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.711
<i>- I'll</i> bring him down.
- Yeah.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.518
Come, we go.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.629
Thought you might want this back.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.950
Heh. Thanks.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.551
I lied to you, Babe.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.477
What do you mean?

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.036
There is no movie.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.391
Miffin told me two weeks ago
it had fallen through.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.276
I guess people just don't want to see

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.279
Laurel and Hardy pictures anymore.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.199
But...

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.911
if I'd told you straightaway, then...

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.878
maybe we could have finished
the tour early

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.873
and you wouldn't have gotten sick.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.239
You knew two weeks ago
there was no movie?

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.836
Yes, and I've been feeling terrible
about it.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.392
Stan...

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.314
I knew.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.956
- You knew?
- I knew.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.560
Well, why didn't you tell me you knew?

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.678
I thought you already knew I knew.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.990
How could I know that you knew I knew?

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.790
What would my line be here?

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.952
Um, well, "Now I know you knew,
but I thought you knew I knew,

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.952
but you were pretending
not to know I knew."

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.356
Ha-ha-ha. Thank you.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.674
Wait, if we both knew,

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.956
why did we keep rehearsing the movie?

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.995
What else are we gonna do?

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.434
Thank you.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.352
Thank you very much.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.114
Thank you. Thank you.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.996
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Hello. Hello.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.474
- Thank you. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.755
- I'm sorry. Good evening.
- Hello.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.830
- Good evening.
- My goodness.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.149
Thank you very much. Hello.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.754
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Right.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.240
- Good evening.
- No, no, no.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.754
- No. No, no, no.
- What? Oh.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.315
- No.
- That's fine. That's fine.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.118
Good evening.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.317
Oh, my goodness, I'm a little nervous.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.073
- Heh.
- Don%be.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.356
- They'll be sensational.
- Heh.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.272
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh, no touching.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.119
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.315
Mmm!

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.239
You look tired, Babe.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.629
You look real tired.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.313
Why don't we just go out there

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.153
and, uh, skip the song, say good night

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.469
and we can finish there?

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.072
I'm fine.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.472
It was fun while it lasted,
wasn't it, Stan?

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.276
I'll miss us when we're gone.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.758
So will you.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.191
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.630
We hope you've enjoyed
our bit of fun tonight.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.791
We've certainly enjoyed ourselves,
haven't we, Stanley?

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.553
We certainly have.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.152
Well, we'd like to finish now
with a little dance.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.590
Oh, no.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.714
Maestro, if you would be so kind.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.314
Stanley.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:10.958
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. I can do it.
