-Ready?
-Always.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.435
His name is Peter Dalton.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.803
We're getting married.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.304
There's something
so weird about all of this.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.794
-Doctor?
-That's me.

01:34.861 --> 01:35.829
Good to meet you in the flesh!

01:37.230 --> 01:38.565
(STAMMERING) What happened?

01:38.631 --> 01:41.201
(GRUNTS)
Mum and the Trickster...

01:41.267 --> 01:42.802
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke.
Listen to me.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.404
Everything's going
to be all right.

01:44.471 --> 01:45.939
I can find Sarah.
I can bring her back.
I promise.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.173
But I need you to
be strong for me,

01:48.208 --> 01:48.975
just like you were before.

01:50.043 --> 01:50.910
I know you can do it.

01:52.345 --> 01:53.713
Who are you?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.548
Hello, Clyde!

01:56.983 --> 01:58.785
And that will be Rani!

02:00.220 --> 02:01.688
What?

02:01.754 --> 02:02.722
How do you know my name?

02:04.858 --> 02:06.426
Wait a minute. You must be...

02:06.493 --> 02:07.494
It's you, isn't it?

02:07.560 --> 02:08.928
That's me.

02:09.127 --> 02:12.198
-The Doctor!
-That's him.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.501
I hope you're as good
as Sarah Jane says you are.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.836
Well, you know journalists,

02:16.903 --> 02:19.272
always exaggerating.
But, yeah.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.974
I'm pretty amazing
on a good day.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.743
K9: <i>Master! Query.</i>
<i>Where is Mistress Sarah Jane?</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.879
K9! Did you miss me?

02:25.945 --> 02:27.347
Did you miss me, eh?

02:27.413 --> 02:29.716
K9: <i>Repeat. Whereabouts</i>

02:29.782 --> 02:31.117

-Well...

02:31.184 --> 02:31.951
Where are we?

02:35.021 --> 02:36.623
There's been
a dimensional shift.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.093
Time's moved on. But us,

02:41.227 --> 02:43.396
and this entire building...

02:43.463 --> 02:45.164
We've been left behind.

02:45.231 --> 02:45.932
There's nothing out there.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.578
CLYDE: I said, all along,

02:58.645 --> 03:00.480
I knew there was
something wrong
about all of this!

03:00.547 --> 03:02.582
And what exactly is going on?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.217
I'll explain later.

(WHIZZING SOUND)

03:10.523 --> 03:11.491
Shh!

03:13.426 --> 03:14.794
Here's the answer
to all your questions.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.363
Yes, that was the Trickster.
Yes, we're trapped.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.832
Yes, I'm the only one who
can get us out of the trap.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.801
Yes, I'm gonna
bring Sarah Jane

03:21.868 --> 03:23.803
and your mum and dad
and all the others back safe.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.905
But I can't do any of it
without you.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.109
You... You need us?

03:30.176 --> 03:31.444
Just like Sarah Jane
needs you.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.079
(WHIZZING SOUND)

03:33.146 --> 03:34.747
My mum and dad,
where are they?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.550
Just go along with him, Rani.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.785
I saw him save the world.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.620
You helped me save the world,
Lukey-boy!

03:40.687 --> 03:42.422
Right, come on.
We can use the Tardis.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.857
I assume everyone
knows what the Tardis is?

03:44.924 --> 03:46.626
Unless you've really
not been paying attention.

That noise.
I've heard it before!

04:05.945 --> 04:07.213
That was me,
trying to break through.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.148
I got knocked back
by the Trickster.

K9:

<i>Tardis materialisation.</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:15.421
Wait a minute.
That's the Tardis?

04:15.488 --> 04:17.390
It's just a wooden box!

04:17.457 --> 04:18.524
Come on.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.459
-(WHIRRING)
-You can do it.

(NOISES CEASE)

04:25.665 --> 04:27.333
Okay, got no Tardis.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.136
It can't materialise here
until time moves forward.

04:30.203 --> 04:30.937
What, so we're trapped here,

04:31.804 --> 04:33.306
wherever this is?

04:33.373 --> 04:35.508
No! Because what have I got?
I've got K9.

04:35.575 --> 04:36.576
K9: <i>Affirmative.</i>

04:36.643 --> 04:38.111
And I've got you three.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.246
And any friend of Sarah Jane
Smith is a friend of mine.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.115
But where is this?

04:42.181 --> 04:44.283
What's happened to
the rest of the world?

04:44.350 --> 04:47.020
K9: <i>Our present location:</i>
<i>nowhere, no-when.</i>

You're joking.

No.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.773
Time hasn't stopped.
This second's on a loop.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.043
23 seconds and 23 minutes
past 3:00.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.746
And we're caught inside it.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.715
In this one second.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.417
But again, where
is Sarah Jane?

05:18.851 --> 05:21.020
(SIGHS) I think
she's right here.

Don't worry, Sarah Jane.

Peter, what's going on?
Where is everybody?

05:39.405 --> 05:41.107
Another man... The Doctor?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.109
Sarah Jane, please
listen to me.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.811
All you have to say
is "I do".

05:46.612 --> 05:48.414
And then we'll be together.

05:48.481 --> 05:49.449
I'm so confused.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.755
What's happened? Where are we?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.590
You don't understand.
Just say you'll marry me.

05:57.657 --> 05:58.624
Say "I do".

05:59.859 --> 06:00.893
Of course we're
getting married.

06:03.229 --> 06:04.530
(WHISPERS) There's
another man...

06:05.231 --> 06:05.932
Always.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.801
The Doctor.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.802
Where's the Doctor?

06:10.536 --> 06:11.504
Doctor!

06:18.411 --> 06:19.445
No!

06:19.512 --> 06:20.646
No!

06:23.182 --> 06:25.518
So we've been kept
behind in this second?

06:25.585 --> 06:27.954
K9: <i>Affirmative,</i>

But the rest of the world,
mum and dad,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.157
and everyone else,
they've moved on from here,

06:31.224 --> 06:32.358
going forwards in time.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.260
Why has the Trickster
trapped us here?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.395
Oh, come on, Rani.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.464
You know the answer to that.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.334
We're Sarah Jane's friends,
all of us. Her best friends.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.535
DOCTOR: Yeah, which means?

06:42.602 --> 06:44.737
Hostages!
He can use us to get at her!

06:44.804 --> 06:46.272
We've met the Trickster
before, but

06:46.339 --> 06:47.974
we've never actually
found out who he is.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.877
The Trickster is a creature
from beyond the universe.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.579
Forever trying to break in to
our reality, manifest himself.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.114
He's one of the
Pantheon of Discord.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.749
-That's a good name
for a band.
-(RANI SCOFFS)

06:56.816 --> 06:58.718
Actually, not bad.

He's an eternal exile,
who exists to wreak havoc.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.424
But we can fight him,
the five of us,
and we can win!

-(BLEEPING SOUND)
-Oh!

Ha! That's it! A time trace!

Just a hint of Sarah Jane.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.536
Ooh, she's close.

07:19.305 --> 07:23.109
The moment you put
that ring on my finger,
I was your puppet!

07:23.176 --> 07:24.544
It isn't like that.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.379
It was in case
something went wrong.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.648
The Angel said that people
would try and stop us
being happy.

07:29.882 --> 07:31.517
Listen.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.685
I'll explain.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.320
The Angel?

07:34.387 --> 07:35.988
Of course. I saw him.
The Trickster!

just walked over my grave.

Oh, oh, oh, she's here,
she's here! Sarah!

08:10.022 --> 08:11.691
Sarah Jane. She doesn't
like being called Sarah.

She does by me.

Hold on.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.829
Well, it's later.
Please explain!

08:49.896 --> 08:53.299
The Trickster doesn't
want us helping Sarah.
So he's separated us,

08:53.366 --> 08:55.268
trapped us in two
different seconds.

09:38.544 --> 09:39.912
We can't run away, Sarah Jane.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.016
The one time I fall in love,

09:44.083 --> 09:46.686
the one time everything goes
right, and it's a trap.

09:47.687 --> 09:48.688
I thought I loved you,

but you aren't even real!

I'm here, flesh and blood.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.595
Oh, yes?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.631
And I was worried
about my secrets.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.567
Well, it turned out you
were hiding something
pretty big, weren't you?

10:03.602 --> 10:06.539
I only kept one secret.
I knew you wouldn't
believe me.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.274
You'd think I was mad.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.642
That's why I never told you

10:10.710 --> 10:12.178
about the Angel.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.580
The Angel!
That's what you call him,

10:15.348 --> 10:17.316
but he... It...

10:22.922 --> 10:24.357
Please.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.492
Now, a few months ago,
I was working from home.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.463
<i>Had a stupid accident.</i>
<i>Fell down the stairs.</i>

10:33.332 --> 10:34.433
I thought I was going to die.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.402
Then he appeared.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.407
Peter, I can give you life.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.510
And the true love you've

10:44.577 --> 10:47.346
always longed for.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.682
All you have to do
is give me your agreement.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.819
Do I have your agreement?

10:54.620 --> 10:55.688
Yes!

10:57.790 --> 10:59.091
Then you are real.

11:00.259 --> 11:01.861
Oh, Peter. He tricked you.

11:01.927 --> 11:02.895
No!

11:04.096 --> 11:05.164
He found you for me.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.100
He wanted us to be happy.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.803
Then why the ring?
Why hypnotise me?

11:10.870 --> 11:12.071
He said he would protect you.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.376
You accepted my proposal
before the ring went on.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.645
You said you loved me
before the ring went on.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.548
Didn't you love me?

11:22.615 --> 11:23.582
Didn't you mean it?

11:25.951 --> 11:26.886
Oh, Peter.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.427
RANI: How did we
end up here again?

11:34.493 --> 11:37.096
It's a spatial loop mixed
up with a temporal loop.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.431
How did you
work that one out?

11:38.497 --> 11:40.032
Well, we've been
doing this for a while now.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.634
I have taken notes.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.803
Come on, come on,
come on,
Sarah, let me find you.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.108
And now for the things
I never told you.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.646
I've fought him before.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.550
I fight creatures like him.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.085
That is my life.

11:59.151 --> 12:00.453
He's used my past,

12:01.787 --> 12:02.888
my parents against me

12:04.090 --> 12:05.491
and now he's using you.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.894
He saved me.
He brought us together!

12:09.929 --> 12:11.097
I'll show you what he is.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.032

12:23.709 --> 12:24.910
What do you want?

12:26.378 --> 12:27.746
I want you to be happy.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.184
Hang on, though. This is mad!

12:32.251 --> 12:34.019
The Trickster, he's this
all-powerful immortal

12:34.086 --> 12:36.422
who wants to cause chaos
throughout the stars.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.224
And he wants Sarah
Jane to get married!

12:38.290 --> 12:39.425
What does he get out of that?

12:42.061 --> 12:43.529
You want us to get married?

12:45.030 --> 12:46.832
And then what?

12:46.899 --> 12:48.868
You will forget
all that has happened here,

12:48.934 --> 12:51.003
as though it had never been.

12:51.070 --> 12:56.175
And then here is the life
you will lead.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.744
-Mr and Mrs Dalton!
-(CHEERING)

13:02.982 --> 13:05.885
-All done?
-I've finally got all

13:07.920 --> 13:09.188

a proper little office.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.692
I will bring you happiness.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.363
But what's the price?
There's got to be a catch.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.764
With you there always is!

13:18.831 --> 13:19.899
Sarah Jane...

13:23.102 --> 13:25.804
All you have to say
is "I do".

13:25.871 --> 13:29.108
And if you don't,
you will remain here, forever.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.379
Then so be it.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.748
So will Peter.

13:35.814 --> 13:39.685
And so will your son
and your friends.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.887
You'll condemn them
to remain here?

13:43.255 --> 13:44.590
This place is nowhere.

13:45.691 --> 13:46.825
And it's forever.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.834
Now do you see?
Now do you see what he is?

13:55.901 --> 13:58.804
It doesn't matter!
You can save them,
Luke and the others!

14:01.640 --> 14:02.908
She's here!

Ah! You look better in black.
Or is white the new black?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.760
At last, Doctor!

14:21.827 --> 14:25.231
I could feel this moment
reverberating back
through the ages.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.501
The meeting
of the Pantheon of Discord

14:29.568 --> 14:32.705
and the last
of the Time Lords.

14:32.771 --> 14:35.341

actually meet.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.881
And I know the legends
of the Doctor.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.684
The man of ice and fire,

14:46.585 --> 14:48.687
who walked among gods,

14:48.887 --> 14:52.524
who once held the key
to time in his hands.

14:54.093 --> 14:58.130
Now he is surrounded
by children.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.533
They're my friends.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.936
Which reminds me,
you're looking a bit
lonely for a Pantheon.

15:04.003 --> 15:07.139
I embody multitudes.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.444
And who are you, the man
who has lost everybody,

15:12.511 --> 15:14.747
to talk to me of loneliness?

wonderful she is.

Yes, that's it!

15:54.286 --> 15:55.454
That's what?

15:55.654 --> 15:56.989
She promises to love
and honour her husband,

15:57.056 --> 15:58.424
the wedding ring goes on,
then she's agreed to it,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.326
and she's totally under
the Trickster's power.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.655
Your love brought me
back to life.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.824
How can that be
wrong, to save a life?

21:35.227 --> 21:37.629
Look at this!

21:37.696 --> 21:39.865
This is what he'll do
to millions of people!

21:40.565 --> 21:42.200
Unless...

21:42.267 --> 21:43.735
Unless you break
your deal with him!

21:44.536 --> 21:45.537
But I'll lose you.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.373
I'll die!

21:48.440 --> 21:49.908
I don't want you to be alone.

21:51.777 --> 21:55.147
I love you but
I can't love you.

21:55.213 --> 21:57.516
You said you'd do
anything to save me.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.418
If you love me,
you know what you have to do.

22:02.521 --> 22:03.522
TRICKSTER: No!

22:07.926 --> 22:09.494
Well, you got one thing
exactly right.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.798
Sarah Jane and I,
we were made for each other.

22:12.864 --> 22:14.299
We're the perfect match.

22:14.366 --> 22:15.734
And I know what she would do.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.236
I...

22:18.303 --> 22:21.239
I chose you because

22:21.306 --> 22:24.176
you didn't have the strength.

22:24.242 --> 22:27.379
You really don't know
my Sarah Jane, do you?

22:27.446 --> 22:29.047
She gave me the strength!

22:30.682 --> 22:33.652
And I withdraw my agreement!

22:34.086 --> 22:35.520
No!

22:39.424 --> 22:40.192
(GASPS)

22:45.063 --> 22:45.897
So.

22:48.266 --> 22:49.000
Here I go.

22:52.003 --> 22:52.971
I wish I'd always known you.

22:54.573 --> 22:55.907
I love you, Peter.

22:57.242 --> 22:58.410
And I love you,

22:59.911 --> 23:01.079
Sarah Jane Dalton.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.085
(SHIMMERING SOUND)

23:15.327 --> 23:16.828
Mum!

23:16.895 --> 23:17.863
Luke!

23:19.898 --> 23:22.100
Doctor. Oh, Doctor.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.468
My Sarah Jane,
you did it.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.804
The trap's broken!
Time's moving forward again.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.040
We're going home.

23:29.107 --> 23:29.908
Hold on!

23:31.109 --> 23:32.144
We're all going home.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.912
(WHOOSHING)

23:33.979 --> 23:37.082
If any person can show
just cause or impediment

23:37.149 --> 23:39.417
why they may not
be joined together

23:39.484 --> 23:41.887
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

23:44.723 --> 23:45.991
(MURMURING)

23:46.057 --> 23:47.959
GITA: Where's he gone?

23:48.026 --> 23:49.060
Sarah's bloke,
where's he gone?

23:50.228 --> 23:52.164
He was just there.

23:52.230 --> 23:53.932
(WHISPERING) Where's
the Doctor gone?

23:53.999 --> 23:55.934
That all really happened,
didn't it?

23:57.803 --> 23:58.904
-Yeah.
-K9: <i>Affirmative.</i>

24:06.578 --> 24:07.612
Mum?

24:13.752 --> 24:15.787
I'm sorry, everybody.

24:15.854 --> 24:19.457
I'm afraid the wedding
is cancelled.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.544
Mr Smith,

24:40.212 --> 24:40.979
I need you.

24:45.851 --> 24:48.220
MR SMITH: <i>Welcome back,</i>
<i>Sarah Jane.</i>

24:48.286 --> 24:49.521
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

24:55.927 --> 24:57.095
Mum,

24:58.730 --> 24:59.931
are you all right?

25:00.131 --> 25:01.900
I'm going to be fine.
I've got you, haven't I?

25:03.735 --> 25:05.937
(SIGHS) I can't believe
the Doctor ran off like that.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.707
Sudden disappearing acts.
Yeah, that's him all over.

25:08.773 --> 25:11.243
MR SMITH: <i>Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>escalation of temporal flux.</i>

25:11.309 --> 25:12.544
K9:
<i>Temporal flux escalating.</i>

25:12.611 --> 25:14.079
(WHOOSHING)

25:18.016 --> 25:19.784
Doctor!

25:19.851 --> 25:21.386
What do you
take me for, Sarah?

25:21.453 --> 25:23.321
I just thought I'd go
the quick way.
Ooh...

25:23.388 --> 25:24.756
I like it in here.

25:24.823 --> 25:25.891
Can we have a look?

25:27.826 --> 25:28.894
What, in the Tardis?

25:30.161 --> 25:31.062
My Tardis?

25:33.431 --> 25:34.165
Course you can, yeah.

25:42.173 --> 25:45.343
Oh, wow.

25:45.410 --> 25:48.613
It really is, isn't it?
It's bigger on the inside.

25:49.447 --> 25:50.849
It's beautiful.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.025
Transcendental dimensions!

26:04.863 --> 26:05.931
CLYDE: Wow, what does this do?

26:06.131 --> 26:07.165
Hey, don't touch.

26:09.534 --> 26:11.937
You came all that way.
For me.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.071
You're so important.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.941
Not just to me.

26:16.007 --> 26:18.243
The Trickster wanted
to end your story.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.345
But it goes on.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.148
The things you've done, Sarah,
they're pretty impressive,

26:23.214 --> 26:25.417
but, oh, the things
you're going to do...

26:25.483 --> 26:26.651
(SNIFFS)

26:27.519 --> 26:28.620
The future.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.156
How about we could
go for a ride?

26:31.222 --> 26:33.258
Or back!
To the dinosaurs, yeah?

26:33.325 --> 26:34.993
RANI: Another planet?

26:35.060 --> 26:37.495
No way!
For one thing, you were
grounded by the Judoon.

26:37.562 --> 26:39.264
And your parents
would never forgive me.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.098
Go on!

26:51.443 --> 26:53.912
Is this the last time
I'm ever going to see you?

26:57.282 --> 26:58.817
I don't know.

26:58.883 --> 26:59.851
I hope not.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.323
Bye, Doctor,
until the next time.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.392
Don't forget me, Sarah Jane.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.894
No one's ever
going to forget you.

27:24.776 --> 27:25.744
(DOOR CREAKS SHUT)

27:26.911 --> 27:27.879
(WHOOSHING)

27:30.382 --> 27:32.150
You were right.
He is amazing!

27:32.751 --> 27:33.885
And so are we.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.494
Ashen Hill Manor is reputedly

27:42.560 --> 27:45.030
one of the most
haunted locations in the UK.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.833
Ghosts do not exist.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.936
The EMF readings throughout
the house are spiking.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.271
Something is happening.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.572
(SCREAMING)

27:54.639 --> 27:56.508
Where did she go?

27:56.574 --> 27:58.676
-Look!
-We have to get
out of here.

27:58.743 --> 27:59.844
Get thee to the netherworld!
