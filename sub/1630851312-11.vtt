WEBVTT

00:06.093 --> 00:08.834
That's the smoothie bar.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.880
This is where they keep

00:10.923 --> 00:13.970
the citrus-soaked towels
for extra-sweaty workouts.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.279
That's the steam room.

00:18.322 --> 00:21.673
And, oh, yeah, all the
gym-y stuff is over there.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.763
Yeah. Now, that's what
I'm here for. The gym-y stuff.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.287
Yeah, we found this place
a few weeks ago.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.071
I already feel like a new woman.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.073
I really get
intense workouts in here.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
I bet. This is the first gym
I've ever seen

00:32.119 --> 00:34.643
with a "do not resuscitate"
option.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.515
I am so excited
we got you guys to join.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.082
Yeah, and that
has nothing

00:39.126 --> 00:40.649
to do with
the smoothie bar credit

00:40.692 --> 00:42.346
for new referrals?

00:42.390 --> 00:44.174
Uh, absolutely not.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.003
Now, if you'll
excuse us,

00:47.047 --> 00:48.700
we have $80 in smoothies
to drink.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.920
DAVE:
Man,

00:50.963 --> 00:52.791
this place
looks intense.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.228
Good thing
I got these

00:54.271 --> 00:56.404
new toe shoes
for my workouts.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.276
Dave,

00:59.320 --> 01:01.365
the purpose of shoes

01:01.409 --> 01:03.498
is so that people
don't have to see your toes.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.326
MARTY:
David,

01:05.369 --> 01:08.938
you don't have to buy every
cool thing you see online.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.027
Oh, hey, check out
my Halo View.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.813
I'm monitoring
my heart rate right now,

01:14.857 --> 01:17.599
and right now,
and right now.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.122
And I know that you
are annoying

01:19.166 --> 01:20.950
right now,
and right now,

01:20.993 --> 01:23.344
and right now.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.694
Whoa, Calvin,
you don't just

01:25.737 --> 01:28.305
pick something up without
properly warming up first.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.480
Now, come on.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.700
Do some hip circleswith me.

01:31.743 --> 01:34.311
O-Okay.

01:34.355 --> 01:35.878
Dave, I'm-a need you
to back up, like, five feet.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.055
All right.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.535
Ow.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.887
Getting old. I should've
stretched before I stretched.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.499
Ugh...

01:48.543 --> 01:50.849
Surprise, surprise.
Something barbaric.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.329
Of course
you're good at it.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.985
Whatever, man.
I love boxing.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.987
It's a great workout,okay?

01:58.030 --> 02:00.946
Dave, the thing about
working out is,

02:00.990 --> 02:03.906
you stay ready, you ain't got to
get ready. You know what I mean?

02:03.949 --> 02:06.343
[grunts]

02:06.387 --> 02:07.953
A-And you're
not ready for those

02:07.997 --> 02:10.869
right there.
Now, what you want

02:10.913 --> 02:14.308
to do, do light weight
with a lot of reps.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.787
You know what I'm saying?
Like, here...

02:15.831 --> 02:17.876
[grunting]

02:19.226 --> 02:20.792
[shouts]

02:20.836 --> 02:23.360
And you burn it out,
and you put it back on the rack.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.883
Whoo!

02:24.927 --> 02:28.191
Yeah, that's enough shred
for today, you know.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.150
I don't want Tina
to start tripping.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.674
You know what I mean?

02:32.717 --> 02:34.197
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:34.241 --> 02:35.546
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.510
One. One, two.
Hey. All right.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.815
Give me three.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.165
Four.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.079
[chuckles]

02:47.123 --> 02:49.778
You're actually
not that bad.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.824
Your little toe shoes don't do
your boxing skills any justice.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.566
You know, I actually
used to box a little

02:55.610 --> 02:57.089
back in the
National Guard.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.135
They would call me
the "Kalamazoo-natic."

03:01.355 --> 03:04.140
You just got to keep saying it.
You'll get used to it.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.056
No, I don't want to get used to
saying anything stupid.

03:09.493 --> 03:12.279
You know, I actually used to
fight a little myself, you know.

03:12.322 --> 03:15.456
I mean, not for titles,
mainly for my lunch money

03:15.499 --> 03:17.762
and to sit next to Monet
on the school bus.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.895
Old girl taught me

03:19.938 --> 03:21.984
more about anatomy
than my science teacher.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.727
You know, I...

03:25.770 --> 03:27.642
I got to admit,

03:27.685 --> 03:29.165
turning 40 soon,
and it's been

03:29.209 --> 03:31.298
really getting
me down, but

03:31.341 --> 03:32.647
looking at all this
boxing stuff, I don't know,

03:32.690 --> 03:33.996
brings me back to a time
when I felt like

03:34.039 --> 03:35.824
I was on top
of the world.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.783
Well, maybe we can
get you back there.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.263
Check this out.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.918
They're having an
amateur boxing tournament.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.268
Nothing gets
your mojo back faster

03:45.312 --> 03:47.009
than crushing
a big goal

03:47.052 --> 03:48.271
and beating the hell
out of somebody.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.058
I don't know. You really think
I can handle an actual fight?

03:53.102 --> 03:55.800
With me as your coach?
You can't lose.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.454
Besides, smell that.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.934
[sniffs]
That's Bengay.

04:00.849 --> 04:04.244
You'll be fighting a bunch of
middle-aged suburban dads, man.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.288
You'll be fine.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.724
I don't know...

04:06.768 --> 04:10.032
All right. You know what?
Let's do it.

04:10.075 --> 04:13.514
Let's go.Come on. Oh, ow.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.037
Uh, who's got
that Bengay?

04:21.348 --> 04:22.392
Ooh!

04:22.436 --> 04:24.002
Marty, Marty, Marty.Huh?

04:24.046 --> 04:25.526
How's your heart rate looking?

04:25.569 --> 04:28.311
Oh, it is... 120.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.226
[chuckles]
That's still not high enough.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.184
What?Right, look, let's, uh,

04:32.228 --> 04:34.056
let's fix your form, okay?Mm-hmm.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.972
Now, you want to hit this bag
with small circles, Champ.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.147
Hey, man, why do you
only call me "Champ"

04:38.190 --> 04:39.191
when I'm not good
at something?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.326
All right, well,
my bad, tough guy.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.849
Yeah, let's stick
with "Champ."

04:47.374 --> 04:49.332
Nice form.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

04:50.681 --> 04:51.987
Why is your heart rate
going up?

04:52.030 --> 04:53.118
You having a heart a...

04:54.511 --> 04:56.513
Oh. [chuckles]

04:56.557 --> 04:59.168
I see why.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.778
Hey, man,

05:00.822 --> 05:02.476
is that the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen,

05:02.519 --> 05:04.042
or am I just
dehydrated?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.914
Well, you are
definitely thirsty.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.526
Why don't you just go over there
and talk to her, man?

05:09.570 --> 05:11.528
Are you crazy?
Did you not hear me say

05:11.572 --> 05:14.444
that is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen?

05:14.488 --> 05:16.838
Hey, anybody want to go
a few rounds with me?

05:18.361 --> 05:20.885
Oh, come on, don't make me
fight myself.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.757
I'll do it!

05:22.800 --> 05:25.237
Hey, man, what're you doing?

05:25.281 --> 05:27.805
I am getting you in the ring,
literally and figuratively.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.372
Malcolm, no...Come on, man.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.722
Ow!

05:31.766 --> 05:33.245
[chuckles]

05:33.289 --> 05:36.727
Hi, I'm... gorgeous.
You're Marty. I-I mean...

05:36.771 --> 05:39.861
Hi, gorgeous. I'm Necie.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.038
Now, have you ever
boxed before?

05:43.081 --> 05:44.909
Oh. [scoffs]
Oh, me? [chuckles]

05:44.953 --> 05:47.347
Yeah, me and boxing,
we go way back

05:47.390 --> 05:49.305
to-to-to two hours ago
when my mama brought me in.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.960
[laughs]

05:52.003 --> 05:54.049
I like a proud mama's boy.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.051
I'll take it easy on you,
for your mama's sake.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.879
Oh, no, please.
My mama would love for me

05:57.922 --> 05:59.141
to get beat up
by a beautiful woman.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.317
Ooh, that's sweet.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.145
Ready?

06:03.188 --> 06:04.451
Oh, yeah. Bring it.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.974
[screams]

06:07.976 --> 06:09.020
Ooh...

06:09.064 --> 06:11.980
I am so sorry.
[chuckles]

06:12.023 --> 06:13.285
You okay there, gorgeous?

06:13.329 --> 06:15.418
[grunts]

06:15.462 --> 06:18.465
I-I-I will be

06:18.508 --> 06:20.380
if you have dinner with me.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.817
How's tomorrow night?

06:22.860 --> 06:24.688
Yeah, that's great.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.560
Hopefully, I'll be able
to digest food by then.

06:29.519 --> 06:32.174
And after I worked
on her cupcakes all day,

06:32.217 --> 06:34.655
she had the nerve
to cancel her order.[gasps]

06:34.698 --> 06:36.874
One "The Customer's Always
Wrong" smoothie coming up.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.225
My turn.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.619
So, this mom
at my school, Jessica,

06:42.663 --> 06:44.447
watches one TikTok,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.754
and now she wants every kid
to have a standing desk.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.625
What are we? A start-up?

06:50.148 --> 06:51.454
Hubie, get this woman

06:51.498 --> 06:53.195
a "Sit Your Ass Down, Jessica"
smoothie.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.371
Already blending.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.633
Thank you.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.462
Hey, baby.
You guys still here?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.898
Did you work out?

07:00.942 --> 07:02.683
Oh, yeah, we did
the ab roller thingy

07:02.726 --> 07:03.684
for five minutes.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.555
Yeah, we didn't love it.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.339
Well, you only did it
for five minutes.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.559
Are you judging?
Because I feel judged.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.650
Yeah, why don't you guys
just worry about yourselves?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.914
Well-well, damn,
what's in those smoothies?

07:16.958 --> 07:18.220
Vitamin B Nasty?

07:21.179 --> 07:23.486
[sighs]

07:23.530 --> 07:26.315
Maybe we haven't explored
all that the gym has to offer.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.665
I guess not. You think
we should take a class?

07:28.709 --> 07:30.798
They have those here?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.324
Either that,
or all those women

07:35.367 --> 07:36.586
jumping up and down in there,
they got to pee.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.679
Mmm, that smells
delicious.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.072
Oh, here, try some.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.511
Mmm. That's good.Yeah.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.035
[chuckles]I've never dated
a guy who could cook before.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.080
When did you learn?

07:52.123 --> 07:53.777
Uh, sometime between

07:53.821 --> 07:55.300
eighth and ninth grade.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.477
I didn't have a lot
of friends, so...Mm.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.826
When'd you learn to box?

07:58.869 --> 08:01.785
Somewhere between
ninth and tenth grade.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.178
I didn't have a lot of friends.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.484
Had a lot of bullies, though.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.224
Mm-hmm.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.617
Yeah, me, too.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.401
I could've used you
in school.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.316
Well, what about now?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.622
Anybody bothers you,

08:12.666 --> 08:14.145
I'll knock 'em out.

08:14.189 --> 08:17.148
[chuckles] Ah! [grunts]Exactly.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.802
Oh, no, no, no,
like-like-like, ouch, ouch.

08:18.846 --> 08:19.977
Ooh.[groans]

08:20.021 --> 08:22.153
Oh, my God, are you okay?

08:22.197 --> 08:23.981
Oh, yeah, I just,
I just cut my finger.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.853
Ah... And there
is the blood.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.812
I'm about to faint.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.771
Oh, my gosh,

08:30.814 --> 08:33.469
you don't like blood.
You are so cute.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.949
Oh, that's a lot
of blood.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.994
Okay, let's sit.Okay.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.953
Oh, that's all the blood
in my body.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.476
Ah!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.564
[whimpers]

08:41.608 --> 08:43.348
[groans] Okay.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.525
I am about to
pass out. Um...

08:45.568 --> 08:48.136
Look, just put the garlic bread
in the oven at 325,

08:48.179 --> 08:49.790
and I will be right back.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.444
Oh. Uh...

08:52.488 --> 08:54.925
Marty? Marty?

08:54.969 --> 08:56.448
Come on, Dave!

08:56.492 --> 08:57.841
Finish strong!

09:01.584 --> 09:04.587
Can't believe I made it.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.328
Ten miles, Calvin.

09:06.371 --> 09:10.071
I feel bad for the man
that's going up against you.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.856
All my coaching is making you
a middle-aged beast.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.164
Now, show me
that six-pack.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.557
[grunts]

09:19.384 --> 09:20.864
Here you go.Thank you.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.215
Good job.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.652
Dave?What?

09:25.695 --> 09:27.436
Do you want to be
a champion or not?

09:27.479 --> 09:28.611
You forgot my chips.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.225
Go. I'll be here
when you get back.[groans]

09:38.055 --> 09:39.970
[grunts]Hey, little bro.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.406
Hey.Hey, how was your date?

09:41.450 --> 09:43.017
Oh, it went great.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.149
That is, until I cut my finger
on a paring knife,

09:45.193 --> 09:47.499
saw blood, almost passed out,
and the date ended early.

09:47.543 --> 09:50.677
[laughs] Wait. Whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, man.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.157
Are you serious?Yeah. I'm not worried.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.942
She said my wooziness was cute.

09:57.771 --> 10:00.034
Hey, man, why are your eyebrows
up so high?

10:00.077 --> 10:02.993
Uh, look, I-I hate
to break it to you, little bro,

10:03.037 --> 10:04.821
but, uh, cute usually means,

10:04.865 --> 10:06.867
you know, like...
[stammers]Yeah, what?

10:06.910 --> 10:07.998
You're friend zoned.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.261
Friend zoned?Yeah.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.220
Aw, man.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.917
Now I wish she would've just
let me bleed out.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.531
Get it. Yeah. Ah.

10:19.575 --> 10:20.837
Dave.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.841
You killed it
this week, man.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.495
How you feeling
about the fight today?

10:26.538 --> 10:28.366
I feel good.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.412
You know, I'm not even worried
about turning 40 anymore.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.676
Gemma can't keep
her hands off of me.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.897
Says I remind her
of a young Orlando Bloom.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.856
Is that good or bad?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.555
No, that is
definitely good.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.427
Calvin, thank you
for pushing me

10:45.470 --> 10:47.908
to do this.
This is all because of you.

10:47.951 --> 10:51.346
Hey, you're Dave?
I'm Javier Perez.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.087
Oh, hey, it's nice to meet you.
I saw you on the bracket.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.044
We're fighting
in the first round.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.699
Oh, you're
not fighting me.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.266
You're fighting my son,
Javier Perez Jr.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.313
Or as his friends
call him, "Lil' Satan."

11:08.363 --> 11:10.887
I'm not stupid. I quit fighting
when I turned 40.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.068
Oh, damn.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.071
Calvin, this guy's
gonna kill me,

11:21.115 --> 11:23.726
then take me
to hell with him.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.685
This is all
because of you.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.296
Dave, you're almost 40.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.907
You need to stop listening
to other people.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.528
[grunting]

11:43.572 --> 11:45.182
Anybody test him
for steroids?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.317
I don't know,

11:49.360 --> 11:51.754
but if they aren't testing,
you should get some.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.540
All right, Calvin,

11:55.584 --> 11:58.195
when I die today,
and Gemma remarries,

11:58.239 --> 11:59.762
just promise me,
whoever it is,

11:59.806 --> 12:00.981
you won't be
his best friend, too.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.508
Look, Dave, no one,
especially me,

12:06.551 --> 12:08.945
would think any less of you
for forfeiting this fight.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.992
All right, 'cause
clearly Lil' Satan

12:12.035 --> 12:14.385
is a little possessed
by the devil.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.214
[laughing, grunting]

12:20.652 --> 12:23.960
Okay, look.
I can't, all right?

12:24.004 --> 12:26.136
I quit a lot of things
in my first 40 years.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.965
Some of them justified,
like battle rapping.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.361
Eminem made it look
easy for all of us.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.192
But I set a goal, and...

12:38.235 --> 12:40.281
I'm gonna
see this through.

12:40.324 --> 12:44.024
Look, sometimes it's okay
to move the goalpost.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.808
All right?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.462
Surviving
is the new winning.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.290
Yeah. That's right.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.205
Surviving
is the new winning.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.034
No, you shut up!

12:55.687 --> 12:57.037
[grunts]

12:59.213 --> 13:01.084
[both breathing heavily]

13:05.088 --> 13:06.481
I'm done!

13:06.524 --> 13:08.396
What?I'm done.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.180
You can't quit cardio bootcamp.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.444
I can quit anything that
I paid for, just ask HBO.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.186
[grunting]

13:16.230 --> 13:19.929
Can't we go back
to the good old days

13:19.973 --> 13:22.627
when we had
light cardio

13:22.671 --> 13:24.499
and good talks
over smoothies?Oh.

13:24.542 --> 13:27.589
God, you're so right.
Last week was a magical time.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.678
Oh, see? See?

13:29.721 --> 13:31.941
There you go.
There's my girl.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.030
Yeah, yeah.
I didn't join this gym

13:34.074 --> 13:35.379
to work out.Yeah.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.425
[panting]

13:37.468 --> 13:41.081
A-A-And why are we choosing now
to care what our husbands think?

13:41.124 --> 13:42.996
You know, we could use the gym
the way we want.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.171
Damn right.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.608
So...

13:46.651 --> 13:48.653
do you want to grab
a smoothie and

13:48.697 --> 13:50.351
talk about it
before Dave's fight?

13:50.394 --> 13:52.570
Yes, please.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.051
Okay. Okay, so...

13:55.095 --> 13:57.314
Let's get up out of here.All right.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.540
We're back!

14:07.020 --> 14:10.501
Give us two "We Do What
We Want To Do" smoothies.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.156
With an extra shot
of "in your face."

14:13.200 --> 14:16.899
How about a little
"vitamin V" for my girls?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.684
BOTH:
Oh!

14:19.728 --> 14:22.687
Hey, man, I did some research
on Lil' Satan.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.385
You know, he removed
his own wisdom teeth.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.302
Yeah, man,
he punched them out.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.652
Yeah, yeah, whatever,
Dave's gonna die.

14:30.695 --> 14:31.609
Look, I got
real problems.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.309
Okay, look,
there's Necie.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.963
Time to get out
of the friend zone.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.486
All right, yeah,
go talk to her, Champ.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.922
Stop calling me Champ.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.489
Come on, man.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.839
What's wrong with you?[clears throat]

14:43.883 --> 14:44.927
[deep voice]:
Hey, Necie.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.320
Look.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.321
[chuckles]
Ripped my own Band-Aid off.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.627
Didn't even hurt.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.979
Oh... You are so funny.
[chuckles]

14:53.022 --> 14:55.938
You excited about this match?
I love Lil' Satan.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.592
He never backs down
from a hard fight.

14:57.635 --> 14:58.767
And you like that?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.856
Yeah. In or out
of the ring,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.205
you got to show people
you're not afraid.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.164
Man,

15:04.207 --> 15:05.905
the crowd in here
has fallen off.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.559
Hey!

15:08.603 --> 15:10.213
You talking about me?

15:10.257 --> 15:11.867
What?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.348
What? No, don't "what" me.
You heard me.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.699
What, you want smoke? Yeah,
you just found your lighter.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.007
What's up with you,Champ?

15:21.050 --> 15:23.139
Champ?

15:23.183 --> 15:25.489
[chuckles]
Who you calling a champ?

15:25.533 --> 15:26.838
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.188
It's about to go down, huh.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.885
It's about
to go down, huh.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.148
Marty, calm down.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.149
Why?

15:33.193 --> 15:34.324
Look, I don't know

15:34.368 --> 15:35.369
what's going on with you,

15:35.412 --> 15:37.501
but I don't like it.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.895
Necie...Mm-mm.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.942
Hey, man,
you see what you did?

15:49.165 --> 15:51.559
Quit it, Calvin, not so hard.
That hurts.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.648
Good.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.129
Pain is just fear
leaving the body.

15:56.172 --> 15:59.523
I'm more concerned
about me leaving my body.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.917
Wait.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.398
That's the guy fighting Dave?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.009
He told me he had a dad bod.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.707
That is no dad bod.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.840
All right,
you got this, Dave.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.537
Get angry.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.931
Act like you just saw him throw
a glass bottle in the trash

16:15.975 --> 16:18.673
instead of the
recycle bin.

16:18.716 --> 16:19.979
Who does that?Yeah.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.416
Let's go, Dave.Come on, Dave.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.678
[bell dings]

16:23.721 --> 16:26.724
You got it, Dave.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.813
Come on, Dave.
Get in line.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.424
TINA:
Come on, Dave.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.600
You got this, David.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.994
Yeah, yeah, look,
Dave is holding his own.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.213
CROWD:
Ooh!

16:37.257 --> 16:38.780
Yes.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.695
Well, he was. Looks like
I'm not the only one

16:40.738 --> 16:42.001
getting his heart
ripped out today.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.569
Oh! I need to stop
this fight.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.658
Dave, throw in the towel!

16:47.702 --> 16:49.617
Someone throw me
a citrus-scented towel.

16:49.660 --> 16:52.315
No, no, Gemma.
Look, honey,

16:52.359 --> 16:55.449
it's probably best that
we just don't look.Okay.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.320
Come on, Dave!

16:57.364 --> 16:59.192
You're the Tried and True
from Kalamazoo.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.367
Fight back!

17:03.935 --> 17:05.546
[crowd gasps]

17:07.591 --> 17:09.985
[crowd exclaims]

17:10.029 --> 17:13.206
Don't worry, Dave,
a broken nose adds character.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.644
Come on!

17:16.687 --> 17:17.775
Come on, Dave!TINA: Come on, Dave!

17:17.819 --> 17:18.863
Yeah, there you go.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.865
Let's go, Dave. Yes!

17:20.909 --> 17:22.867
[bell dings]

17:22.911 --> 17:25.653
Good job, Dave.[cheers, applause]

17:25.696 --> 17:27.481
Dave, Dave, Dave,
your corner's over there.That one.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.004
David, over there,
over there.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.313
Good, you did it, man,
you survived.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.097
I did?

17:35.141 --> 17:37.708
I mean, no, no, no,
yeah, sure, I did.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.493
So, you ready
for round two?

17:39.536 --> 17:41.060
It's only been one round?

17:43.018 --> 17:45.977
Uh, what about Lil' Satan,
is he beat up, too?

17:46.021 --> 17:46.761
[Lil' Satan growling]Uh...

17:49.372 --> 17:50.721
One more, one more.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.684
Look, Dave, it's great
that you came this far,

17:56.727 --> 17:59.295
but if you want
to see 41,

17:59.339 --> 18:01.341
I think you know
what you need to do.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.213
Yeah, yeah. I think so, too.Okay.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.084
All right.[bell dings]

18:07.434 --> 18:09.044
CROWD:
Oh!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.132
What?

18:12.178 --> 18:13.135
Oh!

18:13.179 --> 18:15.268
One... Two...

18:15.311 --> 18:18.227
Three. He's out!

18:18.271 --> 18:20.534
He's out![cheering]

18:20.577 --> 18:23.537
Dave, you won!
You won! Hey!

18:23.580 --> 18:25.539
That's my dawg.
That's my dawg.

18:25.582 --> 18:28.150
Yeah.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.979
That's what happens
when you don't recycle.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
Yeah!Tell him, Dave.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.637
Uh-oh. He's coming to.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.247
Let's get out of here.
I don't know

18:38.291 --> 18:39.553
that I have another
knockout in me.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.514
Necie, wait up.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.864
Oh, hey, Marty.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.605
Glad your friend
won the fight.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.129
Oh, uh, yeah, you know,

18:50.172 --> 18:51.826
I definitely lost
some money on that bet.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.047
Hey, uh...

18:56.091 --> 18:57.962
I'm sorry things
got weird with us.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.226
Yeah, what was all that?

19:00.269 --> 19:03.316
I don't know. I-I-I was
just embarrassed.

19:03.359 --> 19:06.493
Before or after you acted
a straight fool with that guy?

19:06.536 --> 19:09.583
Oh, no, way, way before.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.628
Um...

19:11.672 --> 19:14.022
You know, you know on our date
when you called me "cute"?

19:14.065 --> 19:15.502
Um...

19:15.545 --> 19:16.677
I-I guess I just got insecure

19:16.720 --> 19:18.113
you were friend-zoning me.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.593
What?

19:19.636 --> 19:21.682
Marty, I called you cute
because you are cute.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.076
Or you were, until you started

19:25.120 --> 19:27.166
your trash talking,
toxic masculinity act.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.778
No, I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That's not who I am.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.215
I'm not a fighter.
Uh, only beef I got is on Yelp.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.956
[laughs]

19:34.999 --> 19:37.176
I just-- I-I thought
you were into that.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.482
Well, I was into Marty,

19:39.526 --> 19:41.919
the cute guy
who can't take a punch.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.008
Well, he's definitely
into you.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.923
Do you think

19:45.967 --> 19:47.229
I could get
a-another chance?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.797
I promise to
only be myself.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.669
That would be nice, gorgeous.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.282
Oh, my God.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.980
[groans] This will not stop
bleeding. Look at that.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.637
Ooh.Nope, nope.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.855
Hey. Hah.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.471
Well, Dave, I guess
you proved today

20:11.514 --> 20:13.734
that you can be a warrior
at any age.[chuckles]

20:13.777 --> 20:16.127
Two peach smoothies,
extra whipped cream

20:16.171 --> 20:17.520
for two warriors.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.739
Aw.

20:21.307 --> 20:24.571
You do remember that I only won
on a technicality, right?

20:24.614 --> 20:27.095
Yeah, but you showed
you still had some heart,

20:27.138 --> 20:28.401
that you still had
some fight in you.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.446
Well, a little less now.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.448
Hmm.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.276
Thank you for helping me
get through

20:34.320 --> 20:35.799
this whole "turning 40" thing.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.627
Anytime, man.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.587
Hey, you know that wasn't
a legit win, right?

20:42.023 --> 20:43.285
When you're done
with your smoothie,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.244
you and me, back in the ring.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.812
Oh, he'll be there, Tiny Devil.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.035
Calvin,
what're you doing?

20:54.078 --> 20:55.297
Lying. Run.
