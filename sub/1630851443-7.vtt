one of my dancers...

00:16.931 --> 00:19.620
Too bad you have been
blackmailing judge.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.172
- And you didn't need
to do all this shit.

00:21.172 --> 00:23.034
- I like wreaking chaos.

00:23.034 --> 00:24.551
- You told me to
get a job, right?

00:24.551 --> 00:26.172
- I find out you're drinking or
doing drugs down there,

00:26.172 --> 00:27.586
you're going back to jail.

00:27.586 --> 00:29.620
- I don't know what happened.
- You got drugged.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.862

01:41.206 --> 01:43.931

01:43.931 --> 01:46.448
- Nah, Madam, this ain't you.

01:46.448 --> 01:48.724
See, they know all about you.

How you like the kids in need,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.034

02:04.689 --> 02:06.655
The fight, everything.

02:06.655 --> 02:08.103

02:08.103 --> 02:09.896
- Does she know y'all
got him out of bed?

02:09.896 --> 02:11.965
- Shit, I swear she didn't.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.448
-Okay.

02:14.862 --> 02:16.862
I could use this.

02:16.862 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

I'm gonna make this work.

02:21.034 --> 02:23.586

02:23.586 --> 02:26.275
- Well, first, I'm gonna
make sure that he doesn't say

02:26.275 --> 02:27.896
anything to her.

02:27.896 --> 02:30.551
- Mm, and how
you gonna do that?

02:30.551 --> 02:33.586
- I'll embarrass him so good
that he won't speak about

02:35.448 --> 02:37.344

03:59.655 --> 04:01.379
- Hey, girl.
-Hey.

04:01.379 --> 04:02.827
- Not this nigga.

04:04.655 --> 04:07.896
- You need to stop
being so closed minded.

04:09.344 --> 04:11.724
- Yeah, all right.
Can I bounce?

04:11.724 --> 04:13.344
-Go.

04:28.862 --> 04:32.517

04:34.241 --> 04:35.862
-Absolutely.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.482

04:57.896 --> 05:01.793
I'm still talking to you.

05:01.793 --> 05:03.724
- No.
- Ooh.

05:05.275 --> 05:07.896
You ain't never
been fucked up the ass?

05:10.896 --> 05:12.896
No, please--
-Shut up!

05:12.896 --> 05:14.758
Okay, look here.

05:14.758 --> 05:19.413
I've done this before,
and these niggas like it.

05:19.413 --> 05:23.931
And then they do shit
to make me come back.

05:23.931 --> 05:28.379
You gonna do shit to
make me do it again?

05:28.379 --> 05:31.172
- Please, don't do it, please.

05:31.172 --> 05:35.206
Please.

05:35.206 --> 05:38.413
- Now, look.

05:38.413 --> 05:42.241
This is going to be our
little secret, okay?

05:42.241 --> 05:45.206
And it will never
come back to you,

05:45.206 --> 05:46.758
so long as it doesn't have to.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.379
- No, no.

05:49.965 --> 05:51.068
- Listen, he will be gentle.

05:51.068 --> 05:52.413
- No.

05:52.413 --> 05:53.758
- Just gonna get a
little bit of video.

05:53.758 --> 05:58.620
-No, no, no. Please.

05:58.620 --> 06:02.310
Please, I'm a
youth minister at my church.

06:02.310 --> 06:06.310
Please, don't.

06:06.310 --> 06:09.965
- Okay, um, preacher...

06:09.965 --> 06:11.896
he will be gentle, okay?

06:11.896 --> 06:15.068
And we'll just get a little bit
of video,

06:15.068 --> 06:17.551
just to make sure you stay
quiet. Got it?

06:18.551 --> 06:20.241
-Please don't
let him do that to me.

06:20.241 --> 06:23.862
- Oh fuck.
- What you want me to do?

06:23.862 --> 06:27.137
- Look, don't go
all the way, okay?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.862
And get some good video.

06:33.413 --> 06:36.379
No, no, no, not--

06:55.724 --> 06:57.551
- Damn.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.482
- That nigga say he
was a preacher?

07:01.034 --> 07:02.482
- Yes.

07:02.482 --> 07:05.724
Look, make sure he gets
home unharmed, okay?

07:05.724 --> 07:07.758
- Why you leave him in
there with that nigga?

07:07.758 --> 07:09.689
- He's not gonna
go all the way.

07:09.689 --> 07:12.448
- Madam, that nigga is--
- Ay-ay-ay,

07:12.448 --> 07:14.724
make
sure he doesn't, okay?

07:14.724 --> 07:18.172
- Listen, you can't ask me
go in there and watch them.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.586
- I got it.

07:19.586 --> 07:21.965
Midnight, you need to grow
the fuck up, man,

07:21.965 --> 07:24.931
all muscles and no heart.

07:24.931 --> 07:26.965
- Look, I'm gonna
go home, okay?

07:26.965 --> 07:29.068
Check the place out,
clean everything up.

07:29.068 --> 07:30.482
- Yes, Madam.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.482
- Yo!

07:45.482 --> 07:48.068
How'd it go last night?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.586
- It was fine, bro.

07:49.586 --> 07:51.241
- Make any money?

07:53.931 --> 07:56.206
- What you mean?

07:56.206 --> 07:57.551
- Amateur night.

07:57.551 --> 07:59.206
Did you do it?

08:00.758 --> 08:02.448
- How you know that?

08:02.448 --> 08:04.068
- Online.

08:04.068 --> 08:06.068
Said it was last night and the
night before, but I know you

08:06.068 --> 08:08.482
went last night, because
you was up here dancing.

08:10.310 --> 08:13.379
- Yeah, I did it.

08:13.379 --> 08:15.793
- Make any tips?

08:15.793 --> 08:19.103
- Nah, bro, what's up?
Only made about $2.

08:19.103 --> 08:20.172
- Come on.

08:20.172 --> 08:25.137
- No, won't be doing
that shit no more.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.793
- Alright.

08:26.793 --> 08:27.862
Come on.

08:27.862 --> 08:30.206
Let me show you how to dance.

08:30.206 --> 08:31.551
- What?

08:31.551 --> 08:33.310
- Don't let this shit
fool you, I can dance.

08:33.310 --> 08:34.965
- Red, come on, man.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.310
Can we just clean up this room
before that crazy ass old man

08:37.310 --> 08:38.931
come up here?

08:38.931 --> 08:41.482
- I bet there's a lot of money
in that place though, man.

08:41.482 --> 08:43.068
- Yeah, it is.

08:43.068 --> 08:45.000
- Did you at least ask her
if she had any more openings?

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
- Yo, listen, I told you,
she ain't really hiring.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.482
- Amp, but I'm a good driver,
man.

08:50.482 --> 08:51.551
Just introduce me
to her again,

08:51.551 --> 08:52.793
like--
- Man, chill!

08:52.793 --> 08:54.413
- Man, I need to come up, man.

08:54.413 --> 08:58.931
- Brah, this thirsty shit that
you're doing, it ain't cool.

08:58.931 --> 09:01.931
All right, I told you, if my
aunt needed somebody,

09:01.931 --> 09:04.413
I would hook you up, alright?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.344
You gotta stay cool on that.

09:06.344 --> 09:07.517
You feel me?

09:07.517 --> 09:09.310
- My bad.

09:09.310 --> 09:10.896
You right.

09:10.896 --> 09:12.655
- Always your fucking bad.

09:12.655 --> 09:15.448
Now can we please
clean the damn room?

09:15.448 --> 09:19.000
- Yeah, I got you.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
- Let's just do our part, man.

09:31.172 --> 09:33.655
- Hey.
-Hey.

09:33.655 --> 09:35.551
- So what happened last night?

09:35.551 --> 09:38.275
-Nothing.
He went in the house.

09:38.275 --> 09:40.034
- Did the lights come on?

09:40.034 --> 09:42.000
-Nah.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.517
- Okay.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.103
What about this morning?

09:45.103 --> 09:48.586
-I saw her leave,
and then he left.

09:48.586 --> 09:50.413
- Anything look crazy?

09:50.413 --> 09:52.931
-No.

09:52.931 --> 09:55.793
- Did you ask Kat if
she knows who she is?

09:55.793 --> 09:57.310
-She doesn't.

09:57.310 --> 09:59.310
- So she's not Atlanta police?

09:59.310 --> 10:01.172
-She's FBI.

10:01.172 --> 10:03.034
- What the fuck?

10:03.034 --> 10:04.379
-Yeah.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.862
- What is going on?

10:06.862 --> 10:09.137
-I don't know, Madam.

10:09.137 --> 10:10.965
- No, it's cool, I'm gonna
figure out why the fuck

10:10.965 --> 10:13.827
are they putting
so much heat on me.

10:13.827 --> 10:15.896
-Sorry, Madam.

10:15.896 --> 10:18.137
- Go check out the
club and give me a call.

10:18.137 --> 10:19.793
-I'm on it.
- You know what, Blue?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.896
Come meet me.
I wanna shoot some shit.

10:21.896 --> 10:23.206
I'm fucking stressed out.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.034
Bring me a big ass gun.

10:25.034 --> 10:27.413
-I'll be there as
soon as I'm done.

10:31.724 --> 10:34.379
- Fuck. What the fuck
is going on?

10:34.379 --> 10:35.724
You gotta get this shit
under control, Madam.

10:35.724 --> 10:37.310
Think, think.

10:41.862 --> 10:44.689
- Gene's over here
trying to take my club.

10:44.689 --> 10:47.206
- You don't wanna
start this war with me.

10:47.206 --> 10:48.689
- Get the fuck out.

10:48.689 --> 10:49.965
Got this detective trying to
figure out

10:49.965 --> 10:51.793
what the fuck I did to Allen.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.275
- I need to ask you a couple
questions

10:53.275 --> 10:54.724
about your business partner.

10:56.344 --> 10:59.103
- No one has heard from him
or seen him in several days.

10:59.103 --> 11:01.724
- Now I got this undercover
over here posing

11:01.724 --> 11:04.172
as a foster kid?
This little bitch.

11:04.172 --> 11:07.172
When you turn 18, I'll
hook you up with a job.

11:07.172 --> 11:08.448
- At Eden?

11:08.448 --> 11:09.931
- Uh, that's too
many open flames.

11:09.931 --> 11:13.103
Too many open flames, bitch,
get your shit under control.

12:09.448 --> 12:10.896
-Hey, Blue, what's up?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.482
-Remember those cameras
you told me to put up

12:12.482 --> 12:13.517
around the club?

12:13.517 --> 12:14.931
- I do.

12:16.413 --> 12:19.000
- I was looking for
places to install them.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.068
I found a mini cam, it
was already installed.

12:22.068 --> 12:23.172
It looked to be active.

12:23.172 --> 12:24.896
The light was on and everything.

12:24.896 --> 12:26.724
- Are you finding any more?

12:26.724 --> 12:27.896
-No, not yet.

12:27.896 --> 12:29.551
I pretended not to see.

12:29.551 --> 12:31.482
Because chances are whoever's
monitoring them would have seen

12:31.482 --> 12:34.689
me looking and would have
known we were on to them.

12:34.689 --> 12:36.241
- Alright, hit up Fuego.

12:36.241 --> 12:38.241
He's a whiz with
this kind of stuff.

12:38.241 --> 12:40.000
See if he can work his
tech-magic and find out if there

12:40.000 --> 12:41.896
are any more cameras.

12:41.896 --> 12:44.103
- All right. Calling him now.

12:44.103 --> 12:46.241
I'll let you know what we find.
- All right.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.827
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.620
How you liking it
so far working here?

13:01.620 --> 13:03.448
- Oh, loving it.

13:03.448 --> 13:06.517
Um, the extra hours during
the day definitely help.

13:06.517 --> 13:09.965
I was gonna have to get a second
job anyway, so, shit...

13:09.965 --> 13:11.310
this is perfect.

13:11.310 --> 13:12.448
- I'm glad.

13:12.448 --> 13:14.758
We've had some really
good numbers lately.

13:14.758 --> 13:17.172
Be sure to keep an eye on the
head count, and remind the other

13:17.172 --> 13:19.551
guys who work the front door
to check IDs

13:19.551 --> 13:21.206
and thorough pat-downs.

13:21.206 --> 13:22.413
- Got it.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.448
You're really good
at this stuff.

13:25.448 --> 13:27.344
- I have a good mentor.

13:27.344 --> 13:28.241
- Madam?

13:29.862 --> 13:31.310
Yeah, how long
you been working for her?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.103
- Awhile.

13:33.103 --> 13:36.275
Started working for her a few
years ago at a nightclub.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.206
She was the manager there.
- Mm.

13:38.206 --> 13:40.172
- She was the glue that held
everything together,

13:40.172 --> 13:42.310
had that place jumping like a
trap house.

13:43.551 --> 13:47.724
- When she left, I left
with her, started here.

13:47.724 --> 13:51.275
- Now, I see how you, Blue, the
guys,

13:51.275 --> 13:53.206
the way you all ride for Madam.

13:53.206 --> 13:56.275
- It's honestly the
least we could do.

13:56.275 --> 13:58.586
She got us all out
of a jam or two.

13:58.586 --> 14:00.103
- Yeah.

14:00.103 --> 14:02.000
- Got us making good money,
and she's got our back.

14:03.137 --> 14:06.724
- Yeah. She's the only person
that ever came to visit.

14:06.724 --> 14:08.620
Took my calls.

14:08.620 --> 14:11.896
Put money on my books.

14:11.896 --> 14:13.137
- That's Madam.

14:13.137 --> 14:14.482
- Yeah.

14:14.482 --> 14:16.862
She's like all
four women from "Set It Off"

14:16.862 --> 14:18.379
wrapped in one.

14:18.379 --> 14:21.000
She's a business
woman like Frankie.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.758
She's with the shitz like Cleo.
- Yeah.

14:23.758 --> 14:27.137
- A provider like
Jada's character.

14:27.137 --> 14:30.689
And although she doesn't
publicly show it,

14:30.689 --> 14:33.137
she's got a heart like Tee Tee.

14:33.137 --> 14:35.344
- Yeah. That's definitely her.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.689
- Can I ask?

14:40.689 --> 14:41.931
- Ask what?

14:41.931 --> 14:44.103
- What did you
get locked up for?

14:44.103 --> 14:46.448
- Yeah, like I said,
you know, just a really--

14:46.448 --> 14:47.724
- Long story?

14:47.724 --> 14:50.586
- Yeah, so to speak.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.931
- I was just trying to get to
know you all, that's--

14:52.931 --> 14:54.517
that's all.

14:54.517 --> 14:56.896
- I really like the vibe that
we got going on here, okay?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.482
I don't want that to be
the thing that ruins it.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.724
- I respect that.

15:01.724 --> 15:03.862
We all got our shit.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.000
- We'll have that talk soon.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.655
All right?

15:07.655 --> 15:10.517
- I'll hold you to it.

15:10.517 --> 15:11.862
- Please do.

15:24.241 --> 15:26.827
- You're sure there's no
more cameras back here?

15:26.827 --> 15:28.586
- I'm sure.

15:28.586 --> 15:30.931
Just the two in the main
room and one by the bar.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.517
This thing lets me know the
location of any active recording

15:33.517 --> 15:36.241
devices, anything giving off an
electronic signal that's not

15:36.241 --> 15:38.586
affiliated with our
security system.

15:38.586 --> 15:39.862
Want me to take them down?

15:39.862 --> 15:42.310
- No. It's better to let them
think we don't know about

15:42.310 --> 15:46.000
the cameras, at least for now.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.034
- I'm gonna do one more
sweep before I leave.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.068
Just wanna make sure I
didn't miss anything.

15:51.068 --> 15:52.551
I'll be discreet.

15:52.551 --> 15:53.793
I need to find the relay.

15:53.793 --> 15:55.034
There has to be one here.

15:55.034 --> 15:56.551
I'll find it, I may
be able to hack it.

15:56.551 --> 15:58.758
And we'll be able to see what
they see,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.551
maybe even control
what they see.

16:00.551 --> 16:02.793
- You're really good
at this shit, huh?

16:02.793 --> 16:04.965
- I just work here.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.655
- Dime should be here shortly.

16:06.655 --> 16:08.586
I need to go meet Madam.

16:08.586 --> 16:12.586
You hit me and let me know
if you find anything else.

16:12.586 --> 16:13.724
- Will do.

16:31.103 --> 16:32.931
-Shit.

16:32.931 --> 16:34.000
Those groupings
are looking good.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.448
- Yeah.

16:41.034 --> 16:44.827
Pretty bitch.

16:44.827 --> 16:47.827
I thought you might want some
more practice with her now.

16:47.827 --> 16:53.310
You get as good with her as you
are with that 19,

16:53.310 --> 16:55.344
you're gonna be trouble.

16:55.344 --> 16:56.827
Now slightly different
rules with her.

16:56.827 --> 16:58.379
- I remember.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.379
- Yeah, you gonna be trouble.

17:10.379 --> 17:13.793
- Well, my teacher was
a motherfucking sniper,

17:13.793 --> 17:16.206
so I should be.

17:16.206 --> 17:19.689
Now, what the hell
is going on at Eden?

17:19.689 --> 17:20.965
- I brought in Fuego like you
asked.

17:20.965 --> 17:25.000
He found more four cameras
spread throughout the club.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.862
- Any in my office?
- No.

17:26.862 --> 17:30.344
He found a relay thing,
thinks that he can hack it.

17:30.344 --> 17:31.827
- Good.

17:31.827 --> 17:34.517
- You think it's Gene?

17:34.517 --> 17:37.000
- The question is, what
the fuck is he doing?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.172
- I had him leave
the cameras up.

17:40.172 --> 17:42.448
- Good, make 'em think
we don't even know.

17:42.448 --> 17:47.793
Look, until I fire the cleaning
crew, keep an eye on them.

17:47.793 --> 17:49.758
- What we gonna do about Gene?

17:49.758 --> 17:51.379
You know you should have let
me shot that motherfucker.

17:51.379 --> 17:53.344
Fuck, I'd have cleaned it up.
- I know.

17:53.344 --> 17:57.482
But, nah, I got something
special in mind for him.

17:57.482 --> 18:02.034
Something's gonna keep
him off my back for good.

18:02.034 --> 18:03.551
Come on, let's play.

18:05.103 --> 18:08.724
- Give me this. Alright.

18:31.137 --> 18:33.482
-Hey.
- Hey.

18:33.482 --> 18:37.310
- So, I'm gonna start
dancing full time.

18:37.310 --> 18:41.310
- Oh, cool.
- Okay.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.896
Anyway, Madam said that you
would give me the rundown

18:43.896 --> 18:45.724
on what I need to
do to get ready.

18:45.724 --> 18:48.655
- Yes, well, first of all,
we're gonna have to set up

18:48.655 --> 18:50.896
a fitting with our
costume designer.

18:50.896 --> 18:53.068
You're also gonna
need a new name.

18:53.068 --> 18:54.655
Amp isn't gonna cut it.

18:54.655 --> 18:58.000
- Madam
said the same thing.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.172
- Well, you got the customers
pretty heated on amateur night.

19:03.172 --> 19:05.793
They hadn't never
seen you dance before.

19:05.793 --> 19:08.551
They couldn't keep
their eyes off you.

19:08.551 --> 19:11.206
You left them wanting more.

19:11.206 --> 19:14.344
It's almost like you
got them addicted.

19:14.344 --> 19:17.310
Just that fast.

19:17.310 --> 19:19.620
Addiction.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.206
That's it.

19:21.206 --> 19:26.275
You'll be their "A-dic-tion."

19:26.275 --> 19:27.586
Get it?

19:27.586 --> 19:29.034
- Yeah.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.275
- It also implies that you have
the ability to get a woman

19:31.275 --> 19:35.137
hooked on you in a very sexy
way.

19:35.137 --> 19:37.931
- Okay. Uh, "A-dic-tion."

19:37.931 --> 19:39.931
- Mm-hmm.

19:39.931 --> 19:42.275
- But I don't hate it.

19:42.275 --> 19:44.172
All right, that's
it, Addiction it is.

19:45.862 --> 19:49.000
- Oh, one more thing.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.482
You're gonna need to shave.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.862
Muscle definition shows
better without all the hair.

19:52.862 --> 19:55.034
- What all exactly
do I need to shave?

19:55.034 --> 19:56.379
- Everything.
- Everything?

19:56.379 --> 19:59.172
- Yep. Your chest, stomach,
legs,

19:59.172 --> 20:02.310
and
trim your equipment area too.

20:02.310 --> 20:04.448
We don't need any wild
hairs sticking out.

20:04.448 --> 20:06.241
It ruins the fantasy.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.862
- Mm, okay, well, anything
else I need to know?

20:14.137 --> 20:17.103
- Some of the guys do things

20:17.103 --> 20:20.344
above and beyond just dancing.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.586
- What do you mean? Like things
like what?

20:23.586 --> 20:27.241
- Private parties,
drugs, escorting.

20:27.241 --> 20:28.758
Just be careful.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.344
I've seen what this life and
all that money

20:31.344 --> 20:33.689
can do to somebody.

20:33.689 --> 20:38.482
Seen good people
corrupted, spirits broken.

20:38.482 --> 20:42.206
People ruining their whole
lives wrapped up in this.

20:42.206 --> 20:43.413
- Okay.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.000
- Careful what you
ask you for, Amp.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.172
This shit ain't a game.

20:48.172 --> 20:50.482
- Hey, thanks.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.310
- Yo!

21:04.310 --> 21:05.827
I don't wanna hear it.

21:05.827 --> 21:07.931
- Well, man, if you're
having issues--

21:07.931 --> 21:11.931
- Look, y'all made way more
money than I did last night.

21:11.931 --> 21:13.551
- I get it.

21:13.551 --> 21:15.793
- No, you don't. Look at me.

21:15.793 --> 21:18.551
- Bruh. I don't need to
look at your dick.

21:18.551 --> 21:20.310
- Listen, I'm Midnight.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.379
This shit ain't supposed
to be happening.

21:22.379 --> 21:25.000
- It ain't never happen to me.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.172
- Man, you know what?

21:26.172 --> 21:27.620
- I'm just saying.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.275
- Oh, you're just saying, huh?

21:29.275 --> 21:30.931
Hey, how's Miss Patty?

21:30.931 --> 21:33.620
Are you still sleeping here?
- Oh, so we going there?

21:33.620 --> 21:34.965
- Hey, yo, yo.
- Yeah, we going there.

21:34.965 --> 21:38.103
- Hey, chill out with
that personal shit, man.

21:38.103 --> 21:40.103
- This nigga in here jacking
his dick off, you're telling me

21:40.103 --> 21:42.241
to pump the brakes
on personal shit?

21:42.241 --> 21:44.103
- Chill...out.
- Hey, fuc--

21:44.103 --> 21:45.931
- I don't know why you all
acting like y'all ain't

21:45.931 --> 21:48.862
never been through this. Doc,
come on, I know you have.

21:48.862 --> 21:50.482
- What you talking about?

21:50.482 --> 21:51.896
I don't tie off, bro.

21:51.896 --> 21:54.413
- Yo, this nigga lying.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.482
- What? I'm blessed, bro.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.896
- This nigga say he blessed.

21:57.896 --> 22:00.379
Bro, I cannot with
these lies right now.

22:00.379 --> 22:03.862
- And highly favored.

22:03.862 --> 22:05.689
- I gotta get my shit up, man,
don't have time

22:05.689 --> 22:10.000
to be playing with you.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.344
- Yo?

22:11.344 --> 22:13.310
-Hey.

22:13.310 --> 22:15.310
- Who's this?

22:15.310 --> 22:17.551
-This is Tina.

22:17.551 --> 22:19.275
- What do you want?

22:19.275 --> 22:21.689
-I wanna talk to you.

22:21.689 --> 22:24.034
- I'm at work right now.
-Please.

22:26.068 --> 22:28.896
- All right, let me get to
a place where it's quiet.

22:28.896 --> 22:29.862
-Okay.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.103
- That's what I said.

22:37.103 --> 22:41.586
- That's what--yeah?
- Ur, I didn't say to come in.

22:41.586 --> 22:44.206
- I got her on the phone.
- Who? Tina?

22:44.206 --> 22:45.620
Put it on speaker.

22:48.206 --> 22:49.931
- Yo.

22:49.931 --> 22:52.034
-Hey.

22:52.034 --> 22:53.344
- Hey.

22:53.344 --> 22:55.000
-I missed you.

22:56.482 --> 22:57.965
- Get out of here
with that bullshit.

22:57.965 --> 23:00.310
-No, I do.

23:00.310 --> 23:02.620
- Then why'd you run
out of here like that?

23:02.620 --> 23:04.827
-You know why.

23:04.827 --> 23:05.862
- No, I don't.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.551
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:07.551 --> 23:10.793
-Yeah, well, I don't
wanna talk on the phone.

23:10.793 --> 23:12.586
- Then why was you saying all
that shit you be saying

23:12.586 --> 23:13.896
the last time on the phone?

23:13.896 --> 23:16.517
-I'm sorry, I was
drunk and out of my head.

23:20.310 --> 23:21.448
- You lying.

23:21.448 --> 23:23.379
You spoke to the police.

23:23.379 --> 23:25.758
-Look, I made a mistake.

23:25.758 --> 23:27.551
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:27.551 --> 23:29.965
You know what happened.

23:29.965 --> 23:31.172
-We both do.

23:35.103 --> 23:38.379
- That nigga came in there mad
when he saw us together,

23:38.379 --> 23:41.344
and you shot him.
-What?

23:41.344 --> 23:43.379
- Come on, Tina, you
know what happened.

23:43.379 --> 23:46.482
-Doc, nobody
is on the phone.

23:46.482 --> 23:48.137
- Well, admit
you shot him then.

23:48.137 --> 23:49.862
-Okay, I shot him.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.137
I shot him, okay?

23:51.137 --> 23:52.793
I wanna see you.

23:52.793 --> 23:54.000
- Nah.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.689
-Please.

23:57.034 --> 23:58.827
- Where you at?
-I'm at a hotel.

24:01.172 --> 24:02.413
- Where?

24:02.413 --> 24:03.724
-Just call me
when you get off,

24:03.724 --> 24:05.413
and I'll be there waiting for
you.

24:05.413 --> 24:07.379
I'll tell you then.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.344
- All right.

24:09.344 --> 24:10.724
-I love you.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.379
- Is it clear?

24:14.379 --> 24:15.517
- Yeah.
- Is it clear?

24:15.517 --> 24:17.482
- Yes.
- All right.

24:17.482 --> 24:19.931
Do you believe her?

24:19.931 --> 24:21.724
- Yeah.

24:21.724 --> 24:24.551
- Well, she did say she did it.

24:24.551 --> 24:26.172
- It ain't enough though.

24:26.172 --> 24:27.620
- No, it's not.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.413
- What you need me to do?

24:29.413 --> 24:33.310
- Look, let me know
when you speak to her again.

24:33.310 --> 24:36.551
And find out where she is, okay?

24:36.551 --> 24:38.965
- It might be a setup.

24:38.965 --> 24:41.448
- Yeah, it might be.

24:41.448 --> 24:43.517
Or maybe she's
telling the truth.

24:43.517 --> 24:46.103
Maybe she really missed you.

24:46.103 --> 24:47.344
And it's the dick.

24:47.344 --> 24:48.896
I hear it's good.

24:50.862 --> 24:53.034
Yeah, that's why I'm making
all that money in there.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.965
- All right, good
dick, go on out there.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.689
- All right, Madam.
- Let me know if you talk

24:57.689 --> 24:58.896
to her again, okay?
- Got you.

24:58.896 --> 25:00.862
-- Keep me posted.
-- All right.

25:03.310 --> 25:04.724
- I don't trust that shit.

25:12.724 --> 25:15.448
- I need four
ladies to volunteer.

25:15.448 --> 25:16.689
Who we got in the house tonight?

25:18.758 --> 25:20.896
- Let's see, come on,
you right here.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.724
Yep, yep, yep, you looking good,
lady with the braids, come on.

25:23.724 --> 25:26.172
Put it down. Yep, miniskirt.

25:26.172 --> 25:29.310
And...I'm taking you,
come on, come on up.

25:31.379 --> 25:34.862
- We got something special for
you, a little treat.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.206
you see me, I'm your type

27:51.724 --> 27:52.931
- You again.

27:52.931 --> 27:55.482
- Hey, sorry, I'm
just really hungry.

27:55.482 --> 27:57.448
- Mm, I bet.

27:57.448 --> 27:59.655
What you doing with those
little shiny-ass shoes on?

27:59.655 --> 28:01.206
Gabriel hooked you up?

28:01.206 --> 28:02.482
- What?

28:02.482 --> 28:04.827
Yeah, can I come in?

28:04.827 --> 28:06.586
- Yeah, I just need
to check you first.

28:06.586 --> 28:07.862
- Okay.

28:07.862 --> 28:08.862
- Open your legs.

28:08.862 --> 28:10.827
- Uh, okay.

28:15.413 --> 28:17.068
Why are you doing this?

28:17.068 --> 28:19.068
- I just gotta make sure you
ain't got no weapons on you?

28:19.068 --> 28:20.103
- I don't.

28:20.103 --> 28:21.586
- I didn't
think you would.

28:21.586 --> 28:23.379
You're 17, right?

28:23.379 --> 28:25.068
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

28:25.068 --> 28:27.137
Well, come on in.
- Really?

28:27.137 --> 28:29.793
- Yeah, I'm gonna put
you in Madam's office.

28:29.793 --> 28:31.344
- Okay.

28:31.344 --> 28:33.482
- Come on.

28:33.482 --> 28:34.758
Right after you.

28:34.758 --> 28:36.137
- Thank you.

28:37.724 --> 28:39.103
-Bitch.

28:42.724 --> 28:44.482
- Did you restock?
- Yes, Madam, I did.

28:44.482 --> 28:46.068
- Thank you.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.310
- You ain't gonna
believe this shit.

28:50.310 --> 28:51.655
- What shit?

28:51.655 --> 28:53.344
- Your girl is
at the back door.

28:55.620 --> 28:56.758
- You think he said
something to her?

28:56.758 --> 28:59.793
- Nah. She was chilling.

28:59.793 --> 29:01.931
- Okay.

29:01.931 --> 29:03.620
Bring her to my office.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.655
- I already did.

29:05.655 --> 29:07.448
- Is she clean?

29:07.448 --> 29:09.965
- I checked that hoe like she
was about to get booked.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.344
- I know you do it.

29:14.344 --> 29:15.689
- That bitch.

29:15.689 --> 29:17.517
- No, it's cool.

29:17.517 --> 29:19.586
I got it.

29:19.586 --> 29:21.517
- I know you do.
- Mm-hmm.

29:21.517 --> 29:23.655
I'm gonna enjoy it, too.

29:23.655 --> 29:25.586
- And I got you.
- I know.

29:25.586 --> 29:27.931
- Madam.
- Let's get this bitch.

29:27.931 --> 29:29.551
- Let's get her.

29:35.724 --> 29:38.793
- Yes, ooh.

29:38.793 --> 29:43.000
- So you go MIA for a couple
years,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.448
now you're
a regular customer again.

29:45.448 --> 29:48.655
- Maybe I just missed you.

29:48.655 --> 29:50.551
- Come to see me again?

29:50.551 --> 29:53.517
- When I'm able to work it out.

29:55.034 --> 29:59.344
- Uh, get your own.
This one right here is mine.

30:05.482 --> 30:08.068
- Shit, I need to take this.

30:08.068 --> 30:09.551
Can you watch my purse?

30:09.551 --> 30:12.793
I'll be right back.

30:12.793 --> 30:14.379
- Thank you. Yeah, okay.

30:17.931 --> 30:20.827
- It's crazy how much
she looks like you.

30:20.827 --> 30:22.517
- She who?

30:22.517 --> 30:24.931
- Olivia.

30:24.931 --> 30:26.551
Teresa's daughter.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.241
- Congratulations.

30:34.241 --> 30:37.724
She's beautiful.

30:37.724 --> 30:39.620
She didn't tell you.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.620
- Tell me what?

30:41.620 --> 30:44.896
- That her husband has been
shooting blanks for years.

30:44.896 --> 30:47.034
And then all of the sudden she
turns up pregnant

30:47.034 --> 30:50.517
right after y'all started
hooking up.

30:50.517 --> 30:53.379
Yeah. It's your baby.

30:53.379 --> 30:55.413
- No.

30:55.413 --> 30:57.379
Can't be.
- Look again.

31:01.206 --> 31:03.689
Oh, you don't believe me.

31:07.379 --> 31:09.034
Take it.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.068
Get it tested.

31:11.068 --> 31:12.758
- Well, how do I know
if that's the baby's?

31:12.758 --> 31:16.172
- She only has one child.

31:16.172 --> 31:17.827
- Can you give me that picture?

31:20.896 --> 31:23.517
- Where's he going
in such a rush?

31:23.517 --> 31:25.965
- Sit down, girl.

32:02.793 --> 32:04.758
- He did that to me, too, girl.

32:21.137 --> 32:22.793
- She don't got any money.

33:23.517 --> 33:24.344
- Hey.

33:24.344 --> 33:25.862
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

33:25.862 --> 33:27.551
- I'm okay.

33:27.551 --> 33:28.827
- How was your night?

33:28.827 --> 33:31.000
- It was fine.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.275
- Just fine?

33:33.275 --> 33:35.206
- Yeah.

33:35.206 --> 33:38.241
Uh, is it okay that I'm in here?

33:38.241 --> 33:39.620
- What do you mean?

33:39.620 --> 33:41.344
- I mean, I'm underage.

33:41.344 --> 33:43.413
- Sweetheart, you are
in my office, okay?

33:43.413 --> 33:45.551
You are nowhere near the floor.
It's fine.

33:45.551 --> 33:47.241
- Oh, okay.

33:49.137 --> 33:51.379
- Why are you out so late, hmm?

33:53.413 --> 33:55.448
- I just...

33:58.689 --> 34:01.000
- Is he touching you?
- Who?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.137
- Don't lie to me, Shemika.

34:02.137 --> 34:03.862
Is your foster
father touching you?

34:03.862 --> 34:05.275
- No!

34:05.275 --> 34:07.034
- You can tell me,
you know that, right?

34:07.034 --> 34:10.241
I know a family court judge, and
she's having his ass arrested.

34:10.241 --> 34:12.137
- No, no, no!

34:12.137 --> 34:13.724
- Can I tell you something?

34:15.793 --> 34:17.275
- Yeah.

34:19.620 --> 34:23.482
- I had my security
follow you home last night.

34:25.034 --> 34:27.241
- What?
- Yeah.

34:27.241 --> 34:30.344
She said she looked in the
window, and she saw him

34:30.344 --> 34:34.241
having sex with you.
- What?

34:34.241 --> 34:35.586
- Shemika, is he raping you?

34:35.586 --> 34:37.517
- No, no, no, you
don't understand.

34:37.517 --> 34:39.000
- No? Why not?

34:39.000 --> 34:43.206
- Please, that will just make
it so hard for...the others.

34:45.689 --> 34:46.896
- The others?

34:46.896 --> 34:49.137
- The other foster kids.

34:49.137 --> 34:50.586
- Well, won't this help?

34:50.586 --> 34:52.655
- No, no, he does
it to just me.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.517
Just me, only me.

34:54.517 --> 34:57.344
- You know, that's really odd,
because she didn't say she saw

34:57.344 --> 34:59.068
any other children there.

34:59.068 --> 35:00.413
- They were all asleep.

35:00.413 --> 35:02.827
And they're moving me
in the morning anyways.

35:04.620 --> 35:07.896
- Convenient.

35:07.896 --> 35:10.896
This is him, right?

35:10.896 --> 35:13.344
Thought so.

35:13.344 --> 35:15.068
I want him killed, okay?

35:15.068 --> 35:16.758
He cannot be
hurting little kids.

35:16.758 --> 35:20.000
Especially not you.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.413
And I want you to do it.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.827
- What?

35:25.827 --> 35:27.413
- Here.

35:27.413 --> 35:29.896
I want you to take this.

35:29.896 --> 35:34.965
Go and kill him, come back,

35:34.965 --> 35:36.551
and you can work for me.

35:36.551 --> 35:40.034
You can be my right hand. Here.

35:40.034 --> 35:42.862
- Well, I'm so young.

35:42.862 --> 35:45.034
- Are you?

35:45.034 --> 35:48.344
- What do you mean?

35:48.344 --> 35:51.103
- I was hoing bitches at 14.

35:51.103 --> 35:53.448
- Did you kill anyone?

35:55.655 --> 35:57.724
- No one that
didn't deserve it.

36:00.344 --> 36:03.241
- I can't do it, I can't do it.

36:03.241 --> 36:06.793
- Okay, it's fine.

36:06.793 --> 36:08.034
I'm having it done now.

36:08.034 --> 36:10.551
- What?
- Yeah.

36:10.551 --> 36:13.034
As we speak.

36:13.034 --> 36:14.275
- What?

36:14.275 --> 36:15.689
- I am having him
kill--you know what?

36:15.689 --> 36:18.551
Are you hungry?
You want some hot wings?

36:18.551 --> 36:21.793
- No, no, I need to go.

36:21.793 --> 36:23.068
- You need to go?

36:23.068 --> 36:24.655
- Yeah.
- Blue!

36:26.655 --> 36:28.310
- Yes?

36:28.310 --> 36:31.620
- Shemika says
she needs to leave.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.896
She has to go.

36:33.896 --> 36:36.758
Do me a favor.

36:36.758 --> 36:41.206
Let's get her a ride to
exactly where she needs to be.

36:41.206 --> 36:44.655
- Absolutely.

36:44.655 --> 36:46.068
- Go.
- Okay.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.413
- Oh, Gabriel hooked you up.

36:50.413 --> 36:52.413
I like those shoes, girl.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.827
- You're wearing them.

37:01.655 --> 37:03.793
- Let me go see who he
is and what he wants.

37:20.379 --> 37:22.482
- He says he needs to
have a word with you.

37:22.482 --> 37:26.413
I checked, he's unarmed.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.137
-How can I help you?

37:28.137 --> 37:30.103
- Madam.

37:30.103 --> 37:32.862
It's nice to
officially meet you.

37:32.862 --> 37:35.586
Even lovelier in person.

37:35.586 --> 37:39.068
Can't imagine why someone
would want to have you killed.

37:39.068 --> 37:40.862
- Excuse me?

37:40.862 --> 37:43.000
- You heard me correctly.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.551
- And you know this how?

37:44.551 --> 37:47.000
- Because they tried
to hire me to do it.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.344
I'm guessing you know who it is.

37:48.344 --> 37:51.620
Apparently, you and he
have a bit of history.

37:51.620 --> 37:52.551
- Figures.

37:52.551 --> 37:54.000
- I didn't take the contract.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.827
That's not why I'm here.

37:56.827 --> 37:58.862
This is business.

38:01.758 --> 38:03.586
- I'm listening.

38:03.586 --> 38:07.241
- Your former business partner
had an arrangement with us.

38:07.241 --> 38:08.448
- Who's us?

38:08.448 --> 38:09.965
Who are you?

38:09.965 --> 38:13.206
- The Concierge of
the Damascus family.

38:13.206 --> 38:14.827
- Concierge like at a hotel?

38:14.827 --> 38:16.275
- In essence, yes.

38:16.275 --> 38:19.517
I handle an assortment of things
for the family--legal matters,

38:19.517 --> 38:20.965
finances, surveillance,

38:20.965 --> 38:23.620
which is why I know who the two
of you are.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.655
That's why I have addresses
where the relatives are,

38:26.655 --> 38:30.655
love interests, fuck buddies,
where you shot your guns.

38:30.655 --> 38:32.206
It's all.

38:32.206 --> 38:34.896
You are a hell of a shot, Blue.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.103
- The cameras.

38:36.103 --> 38:37.551
- They're mine.

38:37.551 --> 38:39.620
Had the cleaning crew
install them a while back.

38:39.620 --> 38:43.172
Needed to keep an eye on things.

38:43.172 --> 38:45.931
- So, this business?

38:45.931 --> 38:49.655
- Allen was providing a
service for the family.

38:49.655 --> 38:52.620
We would hand him a quarter
million dollars a month, and

38:52.620 --> 38:55.793
when he handed it back to us,
minus his commission, of course,

38:55.793 --> 38:57.689
it was spotless.

38:57.689 --> 39:00.586
- What does this
have to do with me?

39:00.586 --> 39:03.206
- While reviewing the camera
footage, I saw what I can only

39:03.206 --> 39:07.379
assume was Allen bagged up,
strapped up to a dolly and

39:07.379 --> 39:09.482
rolled out of here.

39:09.482 --> 39:11.103
And it dawned on me.

39:11.103 --> 39:14.965
If Allen is in fact dead, then I
no longer have anyone in place

39:14.965 --> 39:17.551
to process the funds
that I mentioned earlier.

39:19.448 --> 39:21.034
- So this is blackmail?

39:21.034 --> 39:22.931
- Not at all.

39:22.931 --> 39:25.103
This is the only copy of the
security footage

39:25.103 --> 39:27.379
from that night.

39:27.379 --> 39:29.000
Blackmail is beneath me.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.689
But business is business.

39:31.689 --> 39:34.344
We suffered collateral damage as
a direct result

39:34.344 --> 39:36.413
of your actions, Madam.

39:36.413 --> 39:41.068
You removed an essential
component of ours.

39:41.068 --> 39:44.000
It needs to be replaced.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.241
So, as a courtesy, we gave you a
few weeks

39:46.241 --> 39:48.517
to continue generating income.

39:48.517 --> 39:53.310
But we will need to get back
to processing very soon.

39:53.310 --> 39:55.655
- I haven't said yes.

39:55.655 --> 39:58.137
I haven't agreed to anything.

40:00.068 --> 40:02.965
This conversation is more of a
respectful declaration

40:02.965 --> 40:07.551
of what's going to happen, as
opposed to a request.

40:07.551 --> 40:10.310
- Is that a threat?

40:10.310 --> 40:12.931
-Blue.

40:12.931 --> 40:15.068
- I believe I've
overstayed my welcome.

40:15.068 --> 40:17.551
- Mm.

40:17.551 --> 40:19.689
- Do look forward to
talking to you soon, Madam.

40:27.413 --> 40:29.482
- Why you ain't let me shoot
that motherfucker,

40:29.482 --> 40:34.137
coming in here threatening you?

40:34.137 --> 40:35.517
- Bigger picture.

40:35.517 --> 40:40.310
Imagine, eight, nine people just
like you and I

40:40.310 --> 40:42.551
in one family, Blue.

40:42.551 --> 40:45.206
That is the Damascus family.
- I don't give a fuck!

40:45.206 --> 40:46.448
Fuck them!

40:46.448 --> 40:48.000
You know damn well
I'm not scared.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.862
- Neither I am.

40:49.862 --> 40:54.482
But being afraid and being
smart are two different things.

40:54.482 --> 40:56.965
- You really
considering this, Madam?

40:56.965 --> 40:58.310
I don't like it.

40:58.310 --> 41:00.275
Things are going great around
here the way that they are,

41:00.275 --> 41:04.068
why mess it up?

41:04.068 --> 41:05.620
- I agree.

41:05.620 --> 41:09.068
But...having a crime family

41:09.068 --> 41:12.068
like this in my pocket,

41:12.068 --> 41:17.275
owing me...might not be a bad
idea.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.758
Get rid of that cleaning crew.

41:20.689 --> 41:21.965
-Right on it.
- Thank you.

41:28.517 --> 41:33.034
- Mm, I have had
a long fucking day.

41:33.034 --> 41:37.413
I got people after the queen
like I'm an enemy of the people.

41:37.413 --> 41:40.206
And then, my
friend, there's you.

41:41.689 --> 41:44.137
- So, um, I think it's about
time for us

41:44.137 --> 41:48.068
to have a little talk.
-Please! Please!

41:48.068 --> 41:49.344
- MADAM; Blue?

41:49.344 --> 41:53.068
- No, please, I'm sorry! Please!
