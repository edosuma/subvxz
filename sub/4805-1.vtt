01:24.927 --> 01:26.287
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

01:26.327 --> 01:27.527
This is the pilot speaking

01:27.567 --> 01:29.967
You'll notice the "fasten
seat belts" sign is on

01:30.047 --> 01:32.047
Passing through
a little turbulence here

01:32.087 --> 01:35.407
Unfortunately,
we can't get up over it

01:35.447 --> 01:37.487
and we can't
get underneath it, so

01:37.527 --> 01:39.607
just hang in there

01:39.647 --> 01:40.767
Excuse me, miss?

01:44.247 --> 01:45.807
Can I have
a different seat, please?

01:46.407 --> 01:48.647
Oh, I'm afraid
we're full tonight, sir

01:48.687 --> 01:50.167
You're gonna have to stay put

01:51.007 --> 01:52.247
Thanks anyway

02:17.887 --> 02:19.367
He's going to make you
help him

02:20.487 --> 02:21.927
because you're the last

02:32.127 --> 02:33.327
Listen

02:33.367 --> 02:35.927
I really need
to change this seat

02:35.967 --> 02:38.167
I'm sorry
There's nothing I can do

02:40.447 --> 02:41.687
I'm afraid of heights

02:42.447 --> 02:43.847
Don't be a pussy

02:52.287 --> 02:55.527
It's not fair! I was almost out!

03:41.287 --> 03:42.647
Shit!

04:10.887 --> 04:12.847
I'll get you, my pretty

04:12.887 --> 04:15.087
and your little soul, too!

06:37.527 --> 06:39.007
One ticket

06:40.687 --> 06:42.207
Round trip

06:44.287 --> 06:45.367
Hurry up, boy

06:45.407 --> 06:48.127
You don't wanna miss the bus

07:12.287 --> 07:14.967
No screaming
while the bus in in motion

07:48.287 --> 07:51.127
Now be a good little doggy

07:51.807 --> 07:52.927
and go fetch!

09:09.447 --> 09:12.767
Spencer, I wanna make sure
you understand our situation

09:12.807 --> 09:15.527
In one week,
you walk out of here

09:15.567 --> 09:18.927
and I expect some changes in
your behavior when you get home

09:20.247 --> 09:21.447
I know you're hearing me

09:21.487 --> 09:23.447
I put you in here
because you gave me no choice

09:23.487 --> 09:26.007
Next time, I'll leave you here

09:26.047 --> 09:27.167
Thanks for the visit, Dad

09:31.727 --> 09:33.127
Nice job on my kid

09:33.167 --> 09:34.847
I expected to see
some improvement

09:34.887 --> 09:36.287
He isn't a Toyota

09:36.847 --> 09:37.967
What a jerk

09:43.887 --> 09:45.167
You OK?

09:45.207 --> 09:47.847
Yeah Dad just came by
to lay down some ground rules

09:47.887 --> 09:48.967
for when I come home...

09:49.007 --> 09:51.887
no more running away, no more
setting his cars on fire

09:51.927 --> 09:53.007
There are other ways
to get his attention

09:53.047 --> 09:54.447
besides blowing up the garage

09:54.487 --> 09:55.887
Yeah He barely even blinked

09:57.327 --> 09:59.887
All he wants me to do now
is grow up to be him...

09:59.927 --> 10:01.767
an exact copy

10:01.807 --> 10:04.407
I don't feel like playing
football and date-raping coeds

10:04.447 --> 10:06.807
One of these days, you're going
to have to face your father

10:06.842 --> 10:07.927
Maggie

10:09.567 --> 10:11.487
look what I found
in Spencer's room

10:11.527 --> 10:13.127
A pipe bomb, huh?

10:13.807 --> 10:17.167
That? Just showing the kids
survival techniques

10:22.287 --> 10:24.487
Been confiscating stuff
like this all week

10:24.527 --> 10:25.927
Where do they get it?

10:25.967 --> 10:28.247
I'll put this downstairs
with the rest of the arsenal

10:28.287 --> 10:30.287
Weren't the police supposed
to dispose of that stuff?

10:30.327 --> 10:32.967
The police are supposed
to do a lot of things

10:33.007 --> 10:35.127
-Get your hands off of me!
-Tracy!

10:35.167 --> 10:37.287
-What's the problem?
-She was beating on another kid

10:37.327 --> 10:38.487
He was hitting on me!

10:38.527 --> 10:40.407
She doesn't like
to be touched

10:41.247 --> 10:43.327
We have a session today, yes?

10:43.367 --> 10:44.807
I have Doc's class

10:44.847 --> 10:45.967
Work around him

10:47.167 --> 10:48.527
I'm sorry, sir

10:53.407 --> 10:55.087
You seen this junkie before?

10:55.767 --> 10:57.167
No He's new

10:57.207 --> 11:00.967
Beautiful Another afternoon
shot doing juvie paperwork

11:01.007 --> 11:02.167
Screw that shit

11:02.207 --> 11:04.327
Let's just scoop him up
and take him to the shelter

11:05.087 --> 11:07.447
Let the bleeding hearts
do the typing

11:09.087 --> 11:11.287
That's it Come on, Tracy
That's it

11:11.327 --> 11:13.727
Oh, yeah She's bad
The crowd loves her!

11:13.767 --> 11:14.847
She's getting ready

11:14.887 --> 11:18.007
for the heavyweight champion
boxing match of the world

11:18.047 --> 11:19.447
Hey, hey, hey Look at her go

11:19.487 --> 11:21.007
You know, you are sexy
when you sweat

11:22.807 --> 11:25.367
You ain't gettin' none, Carlos!

11:25.407 --> 11:27.487
You wouldn't hit a guy
with a handicap, would you?

11:27.527 --> 11:29.847
Oh, you call it a handicap?

11:29.887 --> 11:31.527
I call it chicken, man!
Come on, let's spar

11:31.567 --> 11:33.847
-No, no Forget it, Trace
-Come on...

11:39.287 --> 11:41.207
Don't tune out Why don't you
talk back to her for once?

11:41.247 --> 11:43.407
Oh, yeah, right Like you
talk back to your father?

11:43.447 --> 11:46.087
Let me tell you something
I stopped talking back

11:46.127 --> 11:48.087
when it became hazardous
to my health, you know?

11:49.847 --> 11:50.967
So, are we set?

11:51.007 --> 11:53.647
Yeah No problem
I gave the van driver our cash

11:53.687 --> 11:55.527
As long as we do it before dawn,
we're home free

11:55.567 --> 11:59.047
We're gonna be livin' large
in Cali before the week is out

11:59.927 --> 12:01.487
You better be sure, man

12:01.527 --> 12:03.087
Trust me, all right?
I got it all covered

12:03.127 --> 12:05.087
I need to get outta here
even more than you do

12:05.127 --> 12:07.287
You don't know shit
about needing to get out!

12:07.327 --> 12:08.847
Your family's a picnic,
rich boy!

12:08.887 --> 12:11.447
What? You think I hang around
you morons by choice?

12:11.487 --> 12:13.007
Least your father
didn't try to set you up

12:13.047 --> 12:14.807
with his girlfriend's
older sister

12:14.842 --> 12:16.527
Don't talk to me about fathers

12:16.567 --> 12:17.887
Yours come to visit, too?

12:18.887 --> 12:20.927
Yeah...
every time I close my eyes

12:33.607 --> 12:36.087
That did it Yep OK

12:36.127 --> 12:37.567
They caught
one of your star pupils

12:37.607 --> 12:39.447
beating up
on one of our kids again

12:40.327 --> 12:41.967
Thought you said
you were making progress

12:42.967 --> 12:45.087
I only get twenty-three minutes
a week with these kids

12:45.127 --> 12:46.527
With that kind of attention

12:46.567 --> 12:47.967
you're lucky
she didn't kill him

12:49.367 --> 12:51.247
That's a good attitude
for a therapist

12:51.287 --> 12:54.807
Tracy's got some deep trauma
buried inside of her head

12:54.842 --> 12:57.287
Conventional therapy
is not going to work

12:57.327 --> 12:59.567
And dream therapy is, huh?

12:59.607 --> 13:00.927
You're such a hippie

13:01.527 --> 13:04.407
I can reach these kids
through their dreams

13:04.447 --> 13:06.367
You give me a chance, I can help
you with your little problem

13:06.407 --> 13:08.287
I don't have a little problem

13:08.327 --> 13:10.527
I just have
a little reoccurring dream

13:10.567 --> 13:12.127
and I'm handling it fine

13:12.167 --> 13:14.487
And you are not being paid
to be a dream doctor

13:14.527 --> 13:15.927
I'm barely being paid

13:15.967 --> 13:17.567
That's why I gotta do
what I think is right

13:17.607 --> 13:18.927
This is new

13:18.967 --> 13:20.087
You like it?

13:21.567 --> 13:24.607
These are ancient dream demons

13:24.647 --> 13:27.327
Supposedly they roam
the dreams of the living

13:27.367 --> 13:31.127
till they find
the most evil, twisted

13:31.167 --> 13:32.407
human imaginable

13:34.167 --> 13:36.647
Then they give him
the power to cross the line

13:36.687 --> 13:38.967
and turn our nightmares
into reality

13:39.847 --> 13:42.527
Maggie, cops just brought in
another kid Real mess

13:42.567 --> 13:45.287
Hasn't sleep for days,
bad case of amnesia

13:45.327 --> 13:46.967
We need your evaluation
right away

13:51.607 --> 13:53.047
How long have you been awake?

13:53.087 --> 13:54.687
As far as I can remember?

13:54.727 --> 13:56.887
I don't know About three days

13:59.007 --> 14:00.767
Looks more like three weeks

14:02.687 --> 14:05.327
Yeah, well,
that's the wonder of amnesia...

14:06.047 --> 14:07.687
always keeps you guessing

14:07.727 --> 14:09.007
Where you from?

14:09.047 --> 14:10.767
I don't know!

14:12.607 --> 14:15.487
All I know
is that wherever I'm from

14:15.527 --> 14:16.767
I was the last

14:16.807 --> 14:17.967
The last what?

14:18.007 --> 14:19.127
Survivor

14:20.327 --> 14:23.367
Look, do you have any

14:23.407 --> 14:26.367
caffeine pills or coffee?
Maybe some coke?

14:27.687 --> 14:29.647
I meant the soda

14:32.447 --> 14:33.527
Sit down

14:44.687 --> 14:45.847
Why do you want to stay awake?

14:45.887 --> 14:47.567
Because if I fall asleep

14:49.167 --> 14:50.527
I'm not waking up

14:50.567 --> 14:51.647
Why do you think that?

14:51.687 --> 14:54.247
I don't think it I feel it

14:56.687 --> 14:59.047
If I fall asleep

14:59.087 --> 15:00.447
there's gonna be trouble

15:04.167 --> 15:05.607
Springwood

15:08.247 --> 15:09.447
Water tower

15:15.887 --> 15:19.567
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

15:19.607 --> 15:21.887
Bottles of beer on the wall

15:22.967 --> 15:26.487
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

15:26.522 --> 15:28.287
Bottles of beer

15:29.807 --> 15:33.367
If one of those bottles
should happen to fall

15:33.407 --> 15:35.887
What a case of...

15:35.967 --> 15:37.367
Hey, I'll break a bottle
over your head

15:37.407 --> 15:39.327
if you don't shut the fuck up!

15:42.807 --> 15:46.487
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-six

15:46.527 --> 15:48.887
Bottles of beer on the wall

15:52.767 --> 15:54.207
I won't tell

16:12.127 --> 16:13.207
Now you're it

16:13.247 --> 16:14.607
Remember what you have to do

16:14.647 --> 16:16.127
You got to tag me

16:17.127 --> 16:18.247
That's it

16:22.487 --> 16:24.167
Come to Daddy

16:56.087 --> 16:57.327
Play with me

16:58.007 --> 16:59.927
Tell me who I am

16:59.967 --> 17:01.487
I won't tell

17:53.567 --> 17:56.447
Free me, you idiot!
I'm your fucking memory!

18:04.047 --> 18:05.487
Oh, shit

18:07.767 --> 18:08.687
Asshole

18:11.247 --> 18:13.047
What were you dreaming about?

18:15.447 --> 18:17.007
A room

18:17.047 --> 18:18.772
A house

18:18.807 --> 18:20.327
A little girl

18:21.487 --> 18:24.367
Something about the town
from my article

18:25.687 --> 18:27.367
I remember a water tower

18:31.127 --> 18:33.407
The article... do you remember
where you got it?

18:34.647 --> 18:37.207
The little girl...
what did she look like?

18:37.242 --> 18:38.967
Brown hair with

18:39.007 --> 18:40.367
red ribbons

18:44.567 --> 18:45.647
I don't like it

18:45.687 --> 18:48.207
There's some connection between
your dreams and his dreams

18:48.247 --> 18:50.687
and his dreams mean bad news

18:50.727 --> 18:52.767
I know you think I'm crazy,
but I can feel it

18:52.807 --> 18:55.687
Why can't anybody talk about
anything but dreams around here?

18:55.727 --> 18:58.047
I'm so sick of hearing
about this bullshit!

18:58.087 --> 18:59.167
You don't believe that

18:59.207 --> 19:01.567
You think solving this boy's
puzzle can help with your own

19:01.607 --> 19:03.007
I don't have a puzzle

19:05.327 --> 19:07.047
Yes, you do

19:07.087 --> 19:08.447
And although you think
you know everything

19:08.487 --> 19:11.087
you may not be ready to face
what this boy will show you

19:11.127 --> 19:12.727
I never said I wanted
to go back there

19:12.762 --> 19:14.612
I've dealt
with amnesiacs before

19:14.647 --> 19:16.967
Take you to Springwood,
it's gonna trigger something...

19:17.007 --> 19:18.487
some spark to help you remember

19:18.527 --> 19:21.687
I don't need a spark to remember
that it was a bad place

19:21.722 --> 19:22.967
You want a spark? You go

19:23.007 --> 19:25.167
I'll stay here,
sparkless but happy

19:25.207 --> 19:27.247
I'll be right there with you
Don't worry

19:27.287 --> 19:30.007
Kelly, we're gonna take
the van for awhile

19:59.047 --> 20:00.727
I told you not to let me
fall asleep

20:00.767 --> 20:02.367
Was that too much to ask for?

20:06.327 --> 20:07.887
Go back

20:07.927 --> 20:09.847
Oh, my God! Pull over!

20:09.887 --> 20:11.007
John, wake up!

20:15.927 --> 20:17.847
Shit Great

20:19.887 --> 20:21.287
Funny meeting you here

20:21.327 --> 20:22.967
Nice driving

20:23.927 --> 20:25.887
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

20:26.687 --> 20:27.847
Great plan, asshole

20:27.887 --> 20:30.327
-It almost worked, all right?
-I can't believe you people

20:30.367 --> 20:33.407
Pulling a stunt like that

20:33.447 --> 20:35.527
Oh, my God

20:35.567 --> 20:38.247
Look, the first thing we have
to do is find a telephone

20:38.287 --> 20:40.007
and you call Kelly
and tell him where you are

20:40.047 --> 20:41.287
You understand?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.727
And then we have to figure out
how to get you home

20:43.767 --> 20:45.327
Are you listening?

20:45.367 --> 20:46.527
Don't scream at me!

20:46.567 --> 20:48.207
It was your driving
that almost killed us

21:16.447 --> 21:18.647
Two for a dollar, right here!

21:18.682 --> 21:19.807
Get 'em, two!

21:20.767 --> 21:21.927
Two for a dollar!

21:23.167 --> 21:26.207
First I want you to find
a phone, call Kelly

21:26.247 --> 21:27.447
and tell him you're all right

21:27.487 --> 21:28.887
Then I want you
to get in that van

21:28.927 --> 21:30.647
and drive straight back
to the shelter

21:30.687 --> 21:31.967
Think you can handle that

21:32.007 --> 21:33.407
or do I have to call
the police?

21:37.367 --> 21:38.927
Get away from here You go away!

21:38.967 --> 21:40.927
"Or do I have to call
the police?"

21:41.687 --> 21:42.887
She ain't my mother

21:44.567 --> 21:46.687
We want some peach cobbler
here and

22:00.567 --> 22:02.247
-There are no kids
-What?

22:03.567 --> 22:04.567
Town fair

22:04.607 --> 22:06.207
and there are no kids

22:17.007 --> 22:19.127
-So what's up, Spence?
-This phone's out of order

22:19.162 --> 22:20.367
So is this town

22:20.407 --> 22:21.367
You are not kidding

22:21.407 --> 22:25.687
Oh, what beautiful,
adorable children!

22:25.727 --> 22:27.407
Would you like to come
and live with us?

22:27.447 --> 22:30.607
It's been so long since
we've had children in the house

22:30.647 --> 22:32.487
So long

22:32.527 --> 22:34.607
This time,
I swear it'll be different

22:34.647 --> 22:36.247
This time, I'll be careful

22:36.287 --> 22:38.927
and I'll hide you better,
so that he'll never find you

22:38.967 --> 22:41.327
Looky, I got your nose! Looky!

22:41.367 --> 22:42.447
Ethel!

22:44.407 --> 22:47.087
I want my children back!

22:47.127 --> 22:48.527
You know they bring him!

22:56.727 --> 22:58.447
Now see what you done did?!

22:59.527 --> 23:01.087
Jesus

23:01.127 --> 23:03.327
-We're in Twin Peaks here
-Definitely

23:03.367 --> 23:04.447
Have we seen enough?

23:04.487 --> 23:05.767
-Yeah
-Good

23:08.807 --> 23:10.767
Come on, back in the van

23:10.807 --> 23:12.447
That's a very good idea

23:12.487 --> 23:13.807
Now Go!

23:13.847 --> 23:14.927
Jeez

23:21.527 --> 23:22.727
I hope they make it

23:22.767 --> 23:24.407
Let's see what they can tell us
at the school

23:25.287 --> 23:27.767
-What?
-Somebody rang those bells

23:28.487 --> 23:29.607
Lucky us

23:46.327 --> 23:48.327
Trace, there's a map back here

23:48.367 --> 23:49.887
Did I say I needed a map?

23:49.927 --> 23:52.327
I can't get over the way
those people looked at us

23:52.367 --> 23:53.967
Yeah, that was weird

24:03.287 --> 24:04.487
Shit

24:06.487 --> 24:07.647
Nice going

24:08.367 --> 24:10.887
Takes talent to travel
in a complete circle

24:10.927 --> 24:12.487
And you're making me dizzy

24:13.527 --> 24:15.207
Jeez

24:15.247 --> 24:16.527
Do you have to do that?

24:16.567 --> 24:18.607
You're such a high ho,
you know that?

24:18.647 --> 24:21.047
I don't play that shit
I need all the senses I've got

24:21.087 --> 24:23.007
Put that fucking thing out

24:23.047 --> 24:24.127
It's hard enough
staying awake

24:24.167 --> 24:25.967
without you lighting up
every ten seconds

24:26.007 --> 24:28.687
-This relaxes me
-I'll relax you

24:28.727 --> 24:30.167
I'll just puncture your heart

24:30.207 --> 24:31.727
mess up these seats

24:31.767 --> 24:32.967
You need to get laid

24:33.007 --> 24:34.687
Would you like the map now?

24:35.607 --> 24:37.487
No, I don't need any map

24:38.407 --> 24:40.007
No, of course not

24:49.487 --> 24:50.607
-Why'd you stop?
-Look

25:19.967 --> 25:21.247
Oh, great

25:23.607 --> 25:24.767
Give me the map

25:26.287 --> 25:28.447
Not a word

25:28.487 --> 25:30.927
Carlos, I asked you for the map!

25:57.367 --> 25:58.487
What is this?!

26:06.207 --> 26:07.847
I asked you for the map

26:07.887 --> 26:09.567
What?

26:11.807 --> 26:13.807
Yeah, well,
the map says we're fucked

26:15.567 --> 26:17.887
Look, you've had two chances
Now it's my turn

26:22.207 --> 26:23.287
Dickhead

26:23.327 --> 26:24.447
Nice

26:42.167 --> 26:44.487
You'll all be expected
to pass

26:44.527 --> 26:47.487
both the written
and an oral examination

26:48.727 --> 26:49.887
Don't disturb him

26:50.567 --> 26:53.767
You will need to study

26:53.807 --> 26:54.967
this

26:58.567 --> 27:00.687
Now the dates
Got to get the dates right

27:00.727 --> 27:02.127
Got to keep them in order

27:02.167 --> 27:04.207
If you get them out of order,
you'll get very confused

27:22.847 --> 27:23.927
You were here

27:23.967 --> 27:25.087
What?

27:28.407 --> 27:29.487
Welcome

27:31.287 --> 27:32.767
to Freddy 101

27:34.407 --> 27:36.207
1493...

27:36.247 --> 27:38.647
Freddy sailed across the sea

27:44.767 --> 27:46.647
These dates, they're all
within a ten-year period

27:46.682 --> 27:48.607
What the hell happened here?

27:48.647 --> 27:50.287
Freddy happened here

27:51.487 --> 27:53.367
Here was the crucial point

27:53.407 --> 27:54.807
Anybody know
what I'm getting at?

27:55.607 --> 27:56.767
Anybody? Hmm?

27:56.807 --> 27:58.367
Come on, people!

27:58.402 --> 27:59.927
We covered this!

28:00.727 --> 28:03.727
This is where
they took away his child

28:03.767 --> 28:05.007
What child?

28:05.047 --> 28:06.127
Taken away

28:06.167 --> 28:07.887
put in the town orphanage

28:07.927 --> 28:09.127
Freddy had a kid

28:14.087 --> 28:17.447
1494...

28:18.407 --> 28:20.087
Freddy came back

28:20.127 --> 28:21.567
to look

28:21.607 --> 28:22.887
for more

28:30.247 --> 28:31.447
There's no way out

28:31.487 --> 28:32.767
Not with you driving

28:32.807 --> 28:34.612
Yeah, well,
you didn't do much better

28:34.647 --> 28:36.807
No, but at least I did it
in half the time

28:39.527 --> 28:41.087
Come on Where are you going?

28:41.127 --> 28:42.807
Away

28:42.847 --> 28:44.287
Look, we're just too fried
to see straight

28:44.327 --> 28:45.407
Let's just find Maggie

28:45.447 --> 28:49.047
I'm not turning myself over
for any adult supervision

28:49.087 --> 28:50.607
This girl's getting some rest

28:51.607 --> 28:54.367
In fact, I think I see my kinda
neighborhood up ahead...

28:54.407 --> 28:55.487
empty

28:55.527 --> 28:56.927
You know, she's losing it

28:56.967 --> 28:58.687
Sad thing is,
I'm starting to like her

28:58.727 --> 28:59.927
That is sad

29:00.527 --> 29:02.247
Come on, Trace Wait up!

29:18.887 --> 29:20.287
This is the one

29:20.327 --> 29:22.087
We'll have it all to ourselves

29:22.807 --> 29:25.247
-Bet there's no heat
-No plumbing, right?

29:25.287 --> 29:26.567
You'll survive

29:28.647 --> 29:29.927
Come on

30:10.647 --> 30:11.727
Where you going?

30:11.767 --> 30:14.767
Gonna go upstairs
and find a bed Man, I'm tired

30:14.807 --> 30:16.487
I gotta find a bathroom

30:17.647 --> 30:20.407
This place makes the shelter
look like the Ritz

30:40.887 --> 30:42.047
Great

30:42.967 --> 30:44.047
Well

30:46.007 --> 30:49.527
at least it beats the streets,
right, Carlos?

30:50.927 --> 30:52.527
Ohh, this is good

30:53.687 --> 30:55.092
I'm gonna get some sleep

30:55.127 --> 30:57.727
and I will get us out of here
in the morning

31:08.887 --> 31:11.527
Why do you think that kid
said not to fall asleep?

31:11.567 --> 31:13.127
'Cause he's a lame-o freak

31:14.647 --> 31:16.287
Miss Maggie's pet psycho

31:42.607 --> 31:43.887
Where the hell are you?

31:43.927 --> 31:46.167
Why aren't you listening
to me, Carlos?

32:02.847 --> 32:04.407
Tracy, where are you?

32:04.447 --> 32:05.967
Behind you

32:09.967 --> 32:11.087
Mama?

32:15.927 --> 32:17.967
Maybe you don't hear so good

32:18.807 --> 32:22.287
Maybe I clean out your ears
for you

32:22.327 --> 32:24.407
No, no Mama, please,
I've been a good boy

32:24.447 --> 32:25.947
You don't understand

32:25.982 --> 32:27.447
I've been good, Mama!

32:27.487 --> 32:30.447
Don't make me deaf, Mama!
Please! I'm sorry!

32:30.487 --> 32:31.567
I'm not

32:46.327 --> 32:49.287
Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear

34:13.206 --> 34:18.567
Give me my hearing back!

34:44.567 --> 34:46.007
Where is it?

35:36.727 --> 35:38.847
Y-you wouldn't do that,
would you, man?

35:39.807 --> 35:40.887
No, no, no! Please!

35:40.927 --> 35:42.047
No, man!

36:57.407 --> 36:59.847
Nice hearing from you, Carlos

37:19.247 --> 37:20.727
I can't find Carlos

37:21.767 --> 37:23.127
See what's on this TV?

37:25.167 --> 37:27.527
I'm gonna take the van
I'm gonna look for him

37:35.127 --> 37:36.287
Give me some room!

37:39.047 --> 37:40.407
Don't fall asleep, man!

37:40.447 --> 37:41.527
Get out!

37:41.567 --> 37:43.447
Spencer, get out, man!

37:43.482 --> 37:45.087
Carlos, man

37:45.847 --> 37:47.727
we were just looking for you

37:49.847 --> 37:51.567
Don't fall asleep, man!

37:51.607 --> 37:53.727
Spencer, you stupid stoner!

38:02.527 --> 38:04.247
We shouldn't even be here

38:06.967 --> 38:08.287
We're supposed to be
finding out about you

38:08.327 --> 38:10.612
not some dead killer's kid

38:10.647 --> 38:13.287
We might be talking
about the same thing

38:13.327 --> 38:15.887
The whole town's obsessing
on this Krueger character

38:15.927 --> 38:17.327
Don't you start

38:18.807 --> 38:21.567
But why else
would they be afraid of me?

38:21.607 --> 38:24.287
Why else am I still alive
when everybody else is dead?

38:24.327 --> 38:26.927
Skip, skip, skip to my loo

38:26.967 --> 38:29.367
Skip to my loo, my darling

38:38.327 --> 38:40.207
Martha, no running

38:40.247 --> 38:41.527
Everyone hold hands

38:43.767 --> 38:45.807
Oh, you've come back

38:45.847 --> 38:47.207
How nice

38:48.167 --> 38:49.327
Do you remember me?

38:49.367 --> 38:50.927
Well, of course I do, my boy

38:50.967 --> 38:53.727
I remember
every one of my children

38:53.767 --> 38:54.967
Especially you

38:55.767 --> 38:57.527
What a pretty little girl
you were

38:58.367 --> 39:00.047
And I remember you

39:00.087 --> 39:01.967
and you

39:02.007 --> 39:03.287
Do you remember
the Krueger child?

39:03.327 --> 39:04.727
Of course

39:04.767 --> 39:06.567
Who was it?

39:06.607 --> 39:09.007
We're not permitted to disclose
a child's real identity

39:09.047 --> 39:10.927
Oh, Melissa Melissa

39:10.967 --> 39:13.007
You must let Bobby
have the ball

39:14.007 --> 39:15.927
Come here That's all right

39:15.962 --> 39:17.207
We share

39:17.247 --> 39:20.087
I wonder who has a little
bare footie around here?

39:20.127 --> 39:21.447
"K Krueger"

39:21.487 --> 39:23.487
Could mean anything
from Kevin to Kyle

39:23.527 --> 39:25.887
All it really means is there was
a child here by that name

39:26.967 --> 39:29.567
No It's me

39:32.647 --> 39:34.367
I'm his kid

39:34.407 --> 39:36.247
That's why he's kept me alive

39:37.487 --> 39:39.327
He's trying to play
some sick game with me

39:39.367 --> 39:41.727
He is dead, all right?

39:41.767 --> 39:43.447
He's dead,
and you're not his kid

39:44.447 --> 39:46.047
How do you know?

39:46.087 --> 39:47.647
She remembered me

39:47.687 --> 39:49.087
She remembered me, too

39:49.127 --> 39:51.327
and fifty other
imaginary friends

39:51.367 --> 39:52.767
Let's get out of here

39:52.807 --> 39:54.687
Let's draw a picture

39:54.727 --> 39:57.087
We can draw pictures all day

39:57.127 --> 39:58.207
There you go

39:58.247 --> 40:00.727
Clippety-clop, clippety-clop
Isn't that fun?

40:07.007 --> 40:08.687
I can't believe I found you

40:08.727 --> 40:10.127
What are you still doing here?

40:10.167 --> 40:11.892
I can't find Carlos

40:11.927 --> 40:14.067
and Spencer's wasted
at this old house

40:14.102 --> 40:16.207
We gotta get to them
before Freddy does

40:16.247 --> 40:17.607
-Who's Freddy?
-I'll tell you on the way

40:17.647 --> 40:18.687
Come on!

40:20.527 --> 40:21.647
God damn it!

40:31.767 --> 40:33.847
All right Once again

40:34.807 --> 40:36.207
This is your brain

40:38.647 --> 40:41.087
This is your brain

40:41.127 --> 40:43.047
on drugs

40:45.207 --> 40:46.327
Questions?

40:47.767 --> 40:50.447
Yeah! What are you on?

40:50.487 --> 40:53.607
Looks like a frying pan
and some eggs to me

40:55.927 --> 40:57.487
Hey, Spence

40:57.527 --> 40:59.287
Let's trip out

41:07.447 --> 41:08.527
Cool

41:44.247 --> 41:45.567
Now he's gone!

41:46.367 --> 41:48.007
He must've fallen asleep

41:48.047 --> 41:49.927
You two look here and upstairs
I'm gonna look downstairs

41:49.967 --> 41:51.367
They're not here anymore

41:51.407 --> 41:54.287
Just humor me,
will you, please, and look?

41:58.007 --> 41:59.407
Where am I?

42:01.007 --> 42:02.487
Jump, boy

42:10.087 --> 42:11.727
-Dad?
-Be like me

42:13.767 --> 42:16.207
Father knows best

42:16.247 --> 42:17.807
Oh! Oh, stop!

42:22.847 --> 42:24.487
I'm not like you!

42:24.527 --> 42:26.007
I don't wanna be like you!

42:28.007 --> 42:30.967
Be like me

42:31.007 --> 42:33.567
Now I'm playin' with power!

42:37.247 --> 42:38.447
All right

42:39.647 --> 42:41.567
Super Spencer!

42:47.167 --> 42:49.127
Great graphics

43:01.727 --> 43:03.447
Whoa I'm here

43:14.807 --> 43:16.567
I found Spencer!

43:21.847 --> 43:23.567
OK, hold him down

43:24.887 --> 43:26.287
Oh, shit

43:27.767 --> 43:29.327
Hold on Hold on to him

43:29.367 --> 43:32.047
-What's happening to him?
-He's stuck in a nightmare

43:32.087 --> 43:33.207
And it's kicking
the shit out of him!

43:34.087 --> 43:36.047
-Wake him up
-He's too wasted

43:36.087 --> 43:38.487
-Spencer! Jesus
-It's Freddy

43:40.487 --> 43:41.847
We've got to get him out

43:41.887 --> 43:43.407
I'll go into his dream

43:43.447 --> 43:45.807
I'll try and bring him out
before he gets killed

43:45.847 --> 43:46.967
That's crazy

43:49.687 --> 43:51.327
What do you call that, rational?

44:09.527 --> 44:11.767
Right, left
Right, left, right, left Pow!

44:26.127 --> 44:26.967
He's getting trashed

44:27.007 --> 44:28.087
I have to go in

44:28.127 --> 44:29.367
What about Freddy?

44:30.167 --> 44:31.247
Freddy won't hurt me

44:31.287 --> 44:32.767
I'm family

44:32.807 --> 44:34.487
OK, so how are you gonna go in?

44:34.522 --> 44:36.087
Well

44:37.327 --> 44:38.607
you're gonna have to lay me out

44:39.527 --> 44:40.607
What? What is th...

44:40.647 --> 44:42.292
-Just fucking lay me out!
-Wait a second!

44:42.327 --> 44:45.927
-Doc told me a different way
-No time to talk! Just do it!

44:53.927 --> 44:56.687
Jesus Christ

45:03.127 --> 45:05.407
I told you I knew an easier way

45:05.447 --> 45:08.527
Concentration meditation
That's what Doc always says

45:09.847 --> 45:11.447
This place is incredible

45:14.087 --> 45:15.567
Pow! Bam! Splat!

45:15.602 --> 45:17.047
Is that him?

45:18.807 --> 45:19.967
Jump, boy

45:21.207 --> 45:22.967
Ow! Stop!

45:23.007 --> 45:24.887
Oh, shit! Spencer!

45:29.367 --> 45:31.287
Come on, John! Let go of me!

45:32.927 --> 45:35.147
Get out of here! Now, Tracy!

45:35.182 --> 45:37.367
Hey, You forgot the power glove

45:39.807 --> 45:41.087
Pow!

45:42.087 --> 45:43.567
Boing, boing

45:56.247 --> 45:58.007
Be like me Be like me

46:13.607 --> 46:14.767
What do you know?

46:14.807 --> 46:16.967
I beat my high score

46:38.007 --> 46:40.807
Great to be back in business

46:40.847 --> 46:42.607
thanks to you

46:49.367 --> 46:52.607
Daddy's waiting for you,
little girl

46:52.647 --> 46:53.967
Shut the fuck up, man!

47:06.327 --> 47:08.407
Spencer's gone
I couldn't stop it

47:09.207 --> 47:10.607
John's still in there

47:10.647 --> 47:11.887
I couldn't wake him up

47:11.927 --> 47:14.327
Come on! Snap out of it!
What are we gonna do?

47:14.367 --> 47:16.767
We're gonna pick him up
and get the hell out of here!

48:19.807 --> 48:21.367
Not again

48:21.407 --> 48:23.287
He's not gonna get me again

48:24.367 --> 48:26.527
Nothing is gonna
make me get off this bed

48:29.567 --> 48:31.167
Damn it!

48:35.927 --> 48:37.087
I hate this house

49:22.487 --> 49:23.887
Up here!

49:39.327 --> 49:40.727
I know why you let me go

49:42.807 --> 49:46.247
Do you think I'm your daddy?

49:49.207 --> 49:51.447
Wrong!

49:55.767 --> 49:57.647
But you let me live

49:57.687 --> 50:01.607
Only long enough for you
to bring me back my daughter

50:01.647 --> 50:02.767
Your daughter?

50:05.847 --> 50:07.047
And now

50:07.087 --> 50:11.927
she's gonna take me
to a whole new playground

50:17.087 --> 50:20.367
Grounded!

50:40.847 --> 50:42.847
Oh, my God, Maggie!
What's going on?

50:43.847 --> 50:45.807
Come on, Maggie Let's go!

50:47.327 --> 50:48.607
Come...

50:48.647 --> 50:50.367
Let's get out of here!

50:50.407 --> 50:51.807
Let's get the hell out of here!

50:51.847 --> 50:54.287
It... it's not a boy

50:55.927 --> 50:57.367
It's

50:59.607 --> 51:01.047
Come on!
We gotta get out of here!

51:01.087 --> 51:03.167
Now! Come on!

51:06.167 --> 51:07.287
Let's go!

51:16.887 --> 51:19.727
You forgot
where you came from, kid

51:20.687 --> 51:23.927
but I know where you're going

51:29.767 --> 51:31.607
It's traveling time!

51:43.887 --> 51:45.967
What's wrong?
Maggie, get in the van!

51:46.007 --> 51:47.087
Come on!

51:48.887 --> 51:51.047
We gotta get the hell
out of here!

51:51.087 --> 51:52.327
Oh, God

51:52.367 --> 51:53.647
Let's go!

52:15.087 --> 52:16.487
Whatever happened

52:16.527 --> 52:18.327
it wasn't your fault

52:30.447 --> 52:31.887
Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer

52:31.927 --> 52:34.247
stowed away in the back
of the shelter van

52:34.287 --> 52:36.647
They were trying to escape
Can you believe it?

52:36.687 --> 52:39.527
So I took them to the phone
They were supposed to call you

52:39.567 --> 52:41.447
John Doe and I were gonna
check out the school

52:41.487 --> 52:43.087
But Tracy got separated

52:43.122 --> 52:44.687
And then they ran away

52:45.887 --> 52:47.127
What the hell
are you talking about?

52:47.167 --> 52:50.007
I'm talking about Carlos
and Spencer and the John Doe!

52:50.047 --> 52:51.967
Kelly, they just disappeared!

52:52.007 --> 52:53.527
Been handling
too many cases, Maggie

52:53.567 --> 52:54.967
Those kids were never here

52:56.447 --> 52:58.327
I would've remembered
any new arrivals

52:58.367 --> 53:00.367
Kelly, I'm talking about
forty-eight hours ago

53:00.407 --> 53:01.487
I brought you a John Doe

53:01.527 --> 53:02.767
Don't tell me
you don't remember that!

53:02.807 --> 53:04.487
You the one who's handling
too many cases!

53:04.527 --> 53:05.647
Get some rest, Maggie

53:09.287 --> 53:10.527
And then

53:11.487 --> 53:13.367
we got back and

53:13.407 --> 53:16.047
no one remembers John or Carlos

53:16.927 --> 53:19.967
It's like they never existed

53:20.007 --> 53:21.687
I've been hearing strange shit

53:21.727 --> 53:25.087
Like some of the kids
are dreaming about Carlos

53:26.047 --> 53:27.447
And they don't even
remember him

53:31.407 --> 53:33.047
I remember him

53:33.087 --> 53:34.647
Why?

53:34.687 --> 53:36.567
Because I can control my dreams

53:36.607 --> 53:39.407
I'm not fooled
by this thing you saw

53:40.247 --> 53:41.327
Whatever he is

53:41.367 --> 53:44.327
he's fucking with the line
between dreams and reality

53:44.367 --> 53:46.847
He didn't just kill Carlos
and the others

53:47.967 --> 53:49.087
He erased them

54:02.807 --> 54:03.927
It's not a boy

54:31.527 --> 54:32.647
Mother!

54:55.767 --> 54:56.887
Shit

55:01.367 --> 55:02.807
You're getting ready
to kill somebody

55:02.847 --> 55:04.407
Defend myself

55:07.207 --> 55:08.847
It's your mind he'll go for

55:11.287 --> 55:12.367
Your fear

55:14.247 --> 55:16.407
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it

55:20.087 --> 55:22.567
Maggie, what are you doing?

55:24.007 --> 55:25.167
Who are they?

55:25.927 --> 55:27.407
Let me have that

55:27.447 --> 55:29.727
-I have to know
-I don't know

55:29.767 --> 55:31.927
I don't know who they were
They wouldn't tell me

55:32.647 --> 55:35.047
They have rules
about no contact

55:36.647 --> 55:38.647
Oh, there's been contact

56:36.207 --> 56:37.607
Find me

56:37.647 --> 56:38.767
Find Daddy

56:39.807 --> 56:40.847
You're it

56:42.967 --> 56:44.447
Come to Daddy

56:46.447 --> 56:48.687
I won't tell

56:48.727 --> 56:49.807
Oh, God

56:58.327 --> 57:00.007
Fred, please

57:00.047 --> 57:01.487
I won't tell

57:04.367 --> 57:06.327
We need to talk, Loretta

57:11.087 --> 57:12.567
Go inside, honey

57:14.087 --> 57:16.007
I won't tell

57:16.047 --> 57:18.087
I told you never

57:18.127 --> 57:20.327
never to go in there

57:20.367 --> 57:22.167
I told you that! I told you

58:30.687 --> 58:32.847
Catherine

58:37.367 --> 58:40.407
You were such a little artist

58:40.447 --> 58:41.847
No, it can't be

58:43.487 --> 58:45.007
I know who I am

58:51.447 --> 58:54.007
You're my blood

58:54.047 --> 58:56.727
Only you could have
brought me out

58:56.767 --> 58:58.447
in your mind

58:58.487 --> 59:00.567
But you can't be my father

59:00.607 --> 59:02.727
They took you away from me

59:02.767 --> 59:05.967
but I made 'em pay!

59:06.007 --> 59:10.207
I took all their children
away from them

59:10.247 --> 59:11.407
and now

59:12.567 --> 59:14.047
that's over

59:15.927 --> 59:17.207
Come on

59:25.207 --> 59:26.607
The shelter

59:27.767 --> 59:32.167
Time to start all over again

59:32.207 --> 59:33.807
But this isn't Springwood!

59:40.887 --> 59:42.527
Every town

59:42.567 --> 59:44.647
has an Elm Street

01:00:19.807 --> 01:00:21.367
Tracy girl

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.607
Daddy's home

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:27.087
Daddy you’re dead

01:00:31.927 --> 01:00:33.367
I'm home, darling

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:44.887
Come say hello

01:00:46.487 --> 01:00:48.087
I don't want to, Daddy

01:00:57.847 --> 01:01:00.727
Come on, give Daddy some honey

01:01:05.847 --> 01:01:07.607
No one has to know

01:01:15.487 --> 01:01:16.767
You're not my daddy

01:01:19.447 --> 01:01:21.207
Come on, Tracy

01:01:28.407 --> 01:01:31.087
Here! Do you love me now?

01:01:36.087 --> 01:01:37.332
He's dead!

01:01:37.367 --> 01:01:39.087
My daddy's dead

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:48.047
No honey for Daddy?

01:01:54.847 --> 01:01:57.287
What's with kids today, huh?

01:01:57.327 --> 01:01:59.127
No respect

01:01:59.167 --> 01:02:01.287
You can't scare me anymore

01:02:01.327 --> 01:02:03.847
Oh, you better speak up

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.367
Must be my deaf ear

01:02:14.247 --> 01:02:17.007
Kung fu this, bitch

01:02:22.847 --> 01:02:25.687
This is my dream,
and I do what I want

01:02:25.722 --> 01:02:27.687
Might be your dream

01:02:27.727 --> 01:02:30.367
but it's my rules!

01:02:50.527 --> 01:02:53.247
Doc... I need to talk to Doc!

01:02:54.807 --> 01:02:55.887
Come on!

01:03:34.127 --> 01:03:36.207
Doc? Doc, is that you?

01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:37.807
Yeah, Tracy Where are you?

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.407
I'm over here
in one of the lockers

01:03:39.447 --> 01:03:40.687
You gotta get me out!

01:03:46.047 --> 01:03:47.207
Where the hell are you?

01:03:47.247 --> 01:03:48.447
Right here

01:03:52.367 --> 01:03:53.172
You taught her a lot

01:03:53.207 --> 01:03:57.167
but there's so much more
to learn

01:03:57.207 --> 01:03:59.447
How about this, Doc?

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:31.487
Sticks and stones
may break my bones

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.887
but nothing will ever kill me

01:04:36.687 --> 01:04:39.807
Well, let's see now

01:04:39.847 --> 01:04:42.767
First they tried burning me

01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:48.687
Then they tried burying me

01:04:54.647 --> 01:04:58.327
But this... this is my favorite

01:05:00.207 --> 01:05:03.367
They even tried holy water

01:05:07.687 --> 01:05:11.767
But I just keep on tickin'

01:05:12.887 --> 01:05:15.727
because they promised me that

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:16.847
They?

01:05:16.887 --> 01:05:18.687
The dream people

01:05:18.727 --> 01:05:20.927
The ones that gave me this job

01:05:22.367 --> 01:05:23.807
In dreams

01:05:24.607 --> 01:05:29.127
I am forever!

01:05:29.167 --> 01:05:30.807
Too bad you're not

01:05:50.087 --> 01:05:51.207
Thank God

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:54.767
I think I've got a way
to get him

01:05:56.447 --> 01:05:57.927
So what's the plan, Doc?

01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:01.247
Thanks

01:06:01.287 --> 01:06:02.607
You can't get him
in the dream

01:06:03.407 --> 01:06:06.407
but if this can come out,
he can come out

01:06:06.447 --> 01:06:08.967
And if he can come out,
he can bleed

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.647
-And die
-Right

01:06:10.687 --> 01:06:12.167
How will you know
when I got him?

01:06:12.207 --> 01:06:13.807
I'm gonna find you with this

01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:15.252
and then I'm bringing you out

01:06:15.287 --> 01:06:17.487
You've got to be holding him
to carry him out

01:06:17.527 --> 01:06:18.967
I know

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:20.727
He's gonna try and trick you
just like Tracy

01:06:21.407 --> 01:06:23.447
He'll try to use your eyes
to fool you

01:06:23.487 --> 01:06:25.047
You'll use these

01:06:25.087 --> 01:06:26.327
Get the hell outta here

01:06:26.367 --> 01:06:27.807
You want to live?

01:06:27.847 --> 01:06:29.887
These mean nothing here

01:06:29.927 --> 01:06:32.087
but in a dream,
they can be anything you want

01:06:32.127 --> 01:06:35.047
He got inside your head
You get inside of his

01:06:36.247 --> 01:06:37.447
That's my job, isn't it?

01:06:37.487 --> 01:06:40.367
Be careful He's good at
finding out what hurts the most

01:06:40.407 --> 01:06:41.487
Exactly

01:06:41.527 --> 01:06:44.127
That's why you gotta take me
with you

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.447
I can't

01:06:45.487 --> 01:06:48.527
It's gotta be me and him

01:06:51.127 --> 01:06:52.367
All right, Doc

01:06:53.407 --> 01:06:54.527
Put me in

01:06:59.407 --> 01:07:00.527
Strap her in

01:07:03.727 --> 01:07:04.967
Take a deep breath

01:07:06.407 --> 01:07:07.767
Good

01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:09.687
Ten

01:07:10.487 --> 01:07:11.807
nine

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:13.887
eight

01:07:13.927 --> 01:07:15.167
seven

01:07:15.207 --> 01:07:16.767
six

01:07:16.807 --> 01:07:18.087
five

01:07:18.127 --> 01:07:19.727
four

01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:20.967
three

01:07:21.007 --> 01:07:22.127
two

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:24.207
one

01:08:20.687 --> 01:08:23.046
Get inside his brain

01:10:17.127 --> 01:10:18.767
I'm in his memories

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:31.287
Son of a hundred maniacs

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.767
You ready for it, boy?

01:11:11.087 --> 01:11:14.567
You been a waste
since the day I took you in

01:11:14.607 --> 01:11:17.207
Now it's time
to take your medicine

01:11:22.767 --> 01:11:24.167
Thank you, sir

01:11:26.047 --> 01:11:27.527
May I have another?

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:34.367
You want to know
the secret of pain?

01:11:35.087 --> 01:11:37.687
If you just stop feeling it

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:38.887
you can start using it

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.287
Child killer!

01:12:05.647 --> 01:12:07.447
We know what you want

01:12:07.487 --> 01:12:09.127
I want it all!

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:10.347
Of course you do

01:12:10.382 --> 01:12:11.527
Then open up

01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:14.767
And you shall be forever!

01:12:41.207 --> 01:12:42.607
Mommy!

01:12:52.207 --> 01:12:54.127
Don't worry, baby

01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:56.487
Mommy just had
to take her medicine

01:12:56.527 --> 01:12:58.687
for snooping
in Daddy's special work

01:13:01.247 --> 01:13:03.887
But you won't tell, will you?

01:13:04.687 --> 01:13:06.087
I won't tell

01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:19.367
But you did tell, didn't you?

01:13:20.687 --> 01:13:24.447
And now it's time
to take your medicine

01:13:29.647 --> 01:13:30.927
You killed my mother!

01:13:36.567 --> 01:13:37.687
She's got him!

01:13:38.727 --> 01:13:40.007
Let's get her out of there

01:14:01.927 --> 01:14:03.087
I've got you!

01:14:10.367 --> 01:14:11.487
I had him!

01:14:12.367 --> 01:14:13.807
Where the hell is he?

01:14:16.367 --> 01:14:17.567
Maybe the trip killed him

01:14:17.607 --> 01:14:19.687
No because
I'm still seeing things

01:14:20.327 --> 01:14:22.247
the way I did in my dream

01:14:22.287 --> 01:14:23.047
It's not over Let's go

01:14:33.767 --> 01:14:35.367
The cops were supposed
to pick this stuff up

01:14:35.407 --> 01:14:36.487
I'm glad they didn't

01:14:36.527 --> 01:14:38.287
We'll have to hit him
with everything we've got

01:14:42.327 --> 01:14:44.567
Check out this knife

01:14:44.607 --> 01:14:46.327
-Hey, put that away
-That's too small

01:14:52.207 --> 01:14:53.767
Guess so

01:14:53.807 --> 01:14:54.927
You sure that's big enough?

01:14:56.647 --> 01:14:58.087
Still believe
he's gonna show up, huh?

01:14:59.167 --> 01:15:00.367
Come on, Tracy Over here

01:15:02.887 --> 01:15:04.287
I can feel it

01:15:34.887 --> 01:15:36.447
You're real here

01:15:36.487 --> 01:15:38.207
It wasn't my fault

01:15:38.927 --> 01:15:40.007
It wasn't

01:15:41.007 --> 01:15:44.207
You saw what they did to me
when I was a kid

01:15:44.247 --> 01:15:45.487
You saw

01:15:47.207 --> 01:15:48.727
I loved you

01:15:50.287 --> 01:15:52.007
And your mother

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.727
I tried so hard to be good

01:15:56.127 --> 01:15:57.407
I know, Daddy

01:15:58.327 --> 01:16:00.167
But when they took you
from me

01:16:00.847 --> 01:16:01.927
it wasn't right

01:16:01.967 --> 01:16:04.367
Oh, I knew you'd believe me

01:16:05.927 --> 01:16:07.047
Come to Daddy

01:16:21.607 --> 01:16:22.887
Over here!

01:16:23.807 --> 01:16:25.247
I'm OK

01:16:25.967 --> 01:16:27.207
Maggie, watch out!

01:16:33.487 --> 01:16:35.327
-Where's the key?
-I don't know!

01:16:36.527 --> 01:16:37.687
The lock's jammed!

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:39.607
I didn't need a glove

01:16:39.647 --> 01:16:41.607
to kill your bitch
of a mother

01:16:41.647 --> 01:16:45.167
and I don't need one now!

01:16:53.327 --> 01:16:55.127
Come on

01:16:55.167 --> 01:16:56.447
Let go

01:17:03.087 --> 01:17:04.487
I'll show you how

01:17:11.087 --> 01:17:12.567
Like you showed my mother?

01:17:12.607 --> 01:17:13.767
And Carlos?

01:17:15.567 --> 01:17:16.687
And Spencer?

01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:20.527
Give Daddy the glove back,
princess

01:17:20.562 --> 01:17:21.647
Never!

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:24.807
Give it to me!

01:17:27.567 --> 01:17:29.127
Gimme the glove!

01:17:32.487 --> 01:17:34.447
In your dreams!

01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:53.887
Oh, Daddy, I remember when we
used to hold hands together

01:17:53.927 --> 01:17:55.767
when I was a kid

01:17:55.807 --> 01:17:56.927
I didn't like it then, either!

01:17:59.927 --> 01:18:02.447
I forgot how much it hurts
to be human

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.487
Go ahead

01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:13.607
put it on

01:19:15.727 --> 01:19:17.207
It's in your blood

01:19:33.007 --> 01:19:34.527
That's it Put it on

01:19:37.287 --> 01:19:39.127
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:19:40.967 --> 01:19:43.527
Yeah come on

01:19:44.687 --> 01:19:47.687
Let your daddy show you
how to use it

01:20:12.367 --> 01:20:14.247
Happy Father's Day

01:20:14.287 --> 01:20:15.567
Come on, Doc!

01:20:19.527 --> 01:20:20.607
Come on! Let's hurry!

01:20:20.647 --> 01:20:21.887
Let's get outta here! Come on!

01:20:21.927 --> 01:20:24.847
Oh kids

01:20:37.167 --> 01:20:38.607
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm OK

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:53.727
Freddy's dead

01:20:54.305 --> 01:21:00.309
