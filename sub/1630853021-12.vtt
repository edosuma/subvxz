WEBVTT

00:06.049 --> 00:08.573
MAN: MR. KERWIN.
MR. KERWIN!

00:08.617 --> 00:10.010
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU!

00:13.100 --> 00:14.188
WHERE'S JULIETTE?

00:16.494 --> 00:17.756
WHERE'S MY SISTER?

00:19.106 --> 00:23.632
SON...SOMETHING HORRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.462
A YOUNG WOMAN--MIA.

00:28.854 --> 00:29.942
SHE BROKE IN.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.644
SHE CAME FOR ME.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.347
SHE KILLED YOUR SISTER.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.133
UHH!

00:51.051 --> 00:52.139
NO.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.152
ZHILAN'S CAMERAS
CAUGHT HER BUSTING
INTO THE TAN MANSION.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.631
BUT NO FOOTAGE
OF HER LEAVING.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.111
SO, MIA'S STILL
IN THERE WITH TAN.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.373
MAYBE ZHILAN
HAS MORE INTEL.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.679
NO. WE'RE LEAVING
HER OUT OF THIS.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.203
OK, SO, WE KNOW

01:13.247 --> 01:14.813
MIA WANTS VENGEANCE.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.380
SHE STORMED INTO
TAN'S MANSION,

01:16.424 --> 01:18.078
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN
NO SIGNS

01:18.121 --> 01:19.383
OF POLICE ACTIVITY SINCE,

01:19.427 --> 01:21.994
SO, WE HAVE TO ASSUME
TAN'S GOT HER.

01:22.038 --> 01:24.214
HE DID IT.
HE HAS EVERYTHING.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.216
THE YUELING BELL,
THE MALLET,
THE SHEET MUSIC.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.000
AND MIA.
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS

01:28.044 --> 01:29.176
TO CREATE A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE

01:29.219 --> 01:30.786
TO OPEN A DOOR TO THIS REALM.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.049
WHERE SOMEHOW HE'LL
SEIZE IMMORTALITY.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.051
SO, THE QUAKE IS WHAT,
A SIDE EFFECT?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.313
I DON'T KNOW
A LOT ABOUT MAGIC,

01:36.357 --> 01:37.662
BUT IT DOESN'T
SEEM THAT CRAZY

01:37.706 --> 01:39.186
THAT RIPPING A HOLE
IN THE COSMOS

01:39.229 --> 01:40.491
TO GET TO ANOTHER
WORLD WOULD HAVE

01:40.535 --> 01:41.927
SOME PRETTY BIG
KNOCK-ON EFFECTS.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.581
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HIS PLAN WILL WORK?

01:43.625 --> 01:45.366
THE POWER OF JYU SA
IS REAL.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.542
I FELT IT.
AND WE SAW SLOAN'S VIDEO.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.413
IT HAPPENED BEFORE.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.459
I NEED TO GET MIA
AND STOP THIS.

01:51.502 --> 01:52.721
YOU CAN'T JUST RIDE
INTO TAN'S MANSION

01:52.764 --> 01:54.984
WITHOUT A PLAN.

01:55.027 --> 01:57.508
THERE MIGHT BE
A SMARTER WAY.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.945
IF WE TIP OFF THE COPS
THAT MIA'S BEEN ABDUCTED,

01:59.989 --> 02:01.164
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET A SWAT TEAM

02:01.208 --> 02:02.600
INSIDE TAN'S ESTATE.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.124
WOULDN'T YOU NEED PROOF?
YOU CAN'T REALLY

02:04.167 --> 02:05.473
TELL THEM
THE WHOLE STORY.

02:05.516 --> 02:06.909
I'M STILL FRIENDLY
WITH SOMEONE

02:06.952 --> 02:08.215
ON THE SPECIALIZED
UNIT DIVISION.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.216
PRETTY SURE IF
I ASK A FAVOR,

02:09.259 --> 02:10.608
HE'LL COME THROUGH.

02:10.652 --> 02:13.176
EVAN, THIS COULD
BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.960
AREN'T YOU TRYING
TO GET YOUR JOB BACK?

02:15.004 --> 02:16.048
I'M DONE.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.879
BESIDES, BURNING
MY LAST BRIDGE?

02:20.923 --> 02:22.794
THAT'S A SMALL PRICE
TO SAVE MIA...

02:22.838 --> 02:23.926
AND OUR CITY.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.410
THE WOMAN
YOU AND JULIETTE

02:29.453 --> 02:31.194
HAVE BEEN HUNTING
FOR MONTHS,

02:31.238 --> 02:33.283
THE ONE WHO'S EVADED
YOU ALL THIS TIME,

02:33.327 --> 02:35.198
WHY WOULD SHE
JUST STORM IN?

02:35.242 --> 02:38.288
I THINK EVERYTHING
WE DID TO MIA...

02:38.332 --> 02:39.898
SHE FINALLY SNAPPED.

02:41.465 --> 02:42.901
AND SHE WENT
AFTER JULIETTE?

02:48.298 --> 02:49.343
FATHER...

02:51.519 --> 02:53.651
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.785
JULIETTE.
SHE CAME TO ME.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.832
YOUR SISTER AND I,

03:00.876 --> 03:03.226
WE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS.

03:03.270 --> 03:06.186
BUT I SAW THE LIGHT.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.535
WE WORKED IT OUT.

03:08.710 --> 03:12.235
WE REACHED
A NEW UNDERSTANDING.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.106
THAT'S WHERE
MIA BROKE IN.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.066
SHE WAS AFTER ME.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.201
THIS IS MY FAULT.

03:24.552 --> 03:30.166
JULIETTE DIED
BECAUSE OF ME.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.519
FORGIVE ME, MY SON.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.526
WE ARE ALL
WE HAVE LEFT.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.052
WE CAN
STILL FINISH

03:47.096 --> 03:50.230
WHAT YOUR SISTER
AND I STARTED--TOGETHER.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.233
WILL YOU JOIN ME?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.997
ALL CLEAR.
NO SIGN OF THE GIRL.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.398
MY TEAM'S STILL LOOKING
BUT SO FAR,

04:28.442 --> 04:31.401
NO EVIDENCE OF KIDNAPPING,
FOUL PLAY, OR THE TANS.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.881
WE KNOW SHE WAS
HERE, ADRIAN.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.012
YOU SAW THE
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.797
WELL, SHE'S GONE.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.189
I WENT OUT ON A LIMB
FOR YOU, MAN.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.105
HEARD THE RUMORS.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.542
WHY YOU REALLY
QUIT YOUR JOB?

04:41.585 --> 04:45.023
DIDN'T WANT TO
BELIEVE 'EM, BUT NOW...

04:45.067 --> 04:46.111
[SOFTLY] I'M SORRY.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.243
JUST GET OUTTA HERE.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.216
NICKY: EVAN?
EVAN: FOUND SOMETHING.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.131
COULD BE USEFUL.
NO SIGN OF TAN OR MIA.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.916
WHAT? WE HAD EYES
ON THE PLACE.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.221
THERE WERE SOME EXITS
THAT ZHILAN'S

05:09.265 --> 05:11.354
CAMERAS DIDN'T COVER.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.051
THEY'VE MUST'VE
SLIPPED AWAY.
THEY'RE GONE.

05:19.667 --> 05:23.801
MIA: WHERE IS HE?
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]

05:23.845 --> 05:24.976
HE'S IN THERE.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.374
NO, NO.

05:37.859 --> 05:38.947
DID I--

05:40.122 --> 05:43.778
HELP! HELP! NICKY!

05:57.574 --> 05:58.358
I PULLED
THE SERIAL NUMBER
AND HACKED INTO

05:58.401 --> 06:00.229
THE COMPANY'S
USER DATABASE.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.752
IT'S JULIETTE'S PHONE.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.363
HOW'D HER PHONE
GET UNDER A COUCH

06:03.406 --> 06:04.755
COVERED IN BLOOD?

06:04.799 --> 06:06.322
JULIETTE IS RUSSELL'S
RIGHT-HAND WOMAN.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.237
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
USEFUL ON HER PHONE.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.456
I'M ON IT.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.066
TAN'S PROBABLY
TAKEN MIA

06:11.109 --> 06:12.284
TO WHEREVER HE INTENDS
TO RING THE BELL.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.460
SO, WHERE WOULD
HE GO?

06:13.503 --> 06:14.765
WELL, WE KNOW
HE'S BEEN USING

06:14.809 --> 06:16.027
JACOB SLOAN'S PLAYBOOK
BUT WE STILL

06:16.071 --> 06:17.333
DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE RANG THE BELL

06:17.377 --> 06:18.595
IN 1906.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.989
MAYBE TAN
FIGURED IT OUT.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.295
BROUGHT MIA AND THE BELL
TO THE SAME SPOT?

06:23.339 --> 06:24.645
THAT'S NOT
A BAD THEORY.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.211
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.083
HE COULD RING THAT BELL
AT ANY MOMENT.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.694
THERE IS SOMEONE
I COULD REACH OUT TO.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.392
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS A LOT
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

06:38.223 --> 06:41.009
GOT TO ADMIT--
I'M SURPRISED YOU CALLED.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.315
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF
AN ALL-HANDS-ON-DECK SITUATION.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.797
TAN'S GOT MIA.
WE FIGURED

06:46.841 --> 06:48.973
THE WAN ZAI
MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING.

06:49.017 --> 06:51.541
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE TAN PLANS
TO RING THAT BELL?

06:51.585 --> 06:52.977
ALL WE KNOW IS
SLOAN INTENDED

06:53.021 --> 06:54.283
TO MAKE JIAMING
RING THE BELL

06:54.326 --> 06:56.416
OVER A GEOTHERMAL
HOTSPOT.

06:56.459 --> 07:00.463
LOCATIONS OF UNUSUAL
THERMAL ENERGY. ANOMALIES.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.465
SAN FRANCISCO'S GOT
DOZENS OF THEM.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.467
SLOAN THOUGHT THEY HAD
MYSTICAL PROPERTIES.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.773
PROPERTIES THAT COULD
OPEN THE DOOR

07:05.816 --> 07:06.861
TO ANOTHER WORLD?

07:08.123 --> 07:10.386
WAIT, THAT COULD
NARROW THE SEARCH.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.736
I'LL--I'LL LET YOU GO.
THANKS, DAD.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.956
I GOT TIME.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.305
AFTER WHAT WENT DOWN
WITH THE RITUAL,

07:16.348 --> 07:18.481
THE ORGANIZATION
SIDED WITH YUEN.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.483
WAIT. THEY KICKED
YOU OUT?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.267
THE WAN ZAI WAS
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.921
I DID WHAT I KNEW
WAS RIGHT.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.053
NO REGRETS.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.272
JUST 'CAUSE THEY
CUT YOU LOOSE

07:27.316 --> 07:28.317
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE

07:28.360 --> 07:29.449
TO GIVE UP THE FIGHT.

07:30.624 --> 07:31.755
HELP US STOP TAN.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.975
HOW? MY BEST PLAY

07:34.018 --> 07:35.455
AGAINST TAN
CAME TO NOTHING.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.499
WHAT PLAY?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.937
ERIC HAN AND I--

07:39.981 --> 07:42.026
WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER
ON A PROJECT.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.463
HE WAS BUILDING
A SONIC DEVICE

07:43.506 --> 07:44.812
THAT HE BELIEVED COULD

07:44.855 --> 07:47.379
SCRAMBLE THE TONES
OF THE YUELING BELL.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.555
IN THEORY,
IT COULD BE USED

07:48.598 --> 07:50.165
TO PREVENT
THE EARTHQUAKE.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.037
AND STOP TAN'S DOOR
TO IMMORTALITY FROM OPENING.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.648
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.693
HAN'S IN NO CONDITION
TO FINISH THE DEVICE AND...

07:58.956 --> 08:00.697
TECH ISN'T REALLY
MY FORTE.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.004
I COULD HELP.
I'VE HEARD HAN SPEAK.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.354
I'VE STUDIED
HIS RESEARCH.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.703
IF WE PUT OUR
HEADS TOGETHER...

08:06.747 --> 08:08.226
WE COULD FINISH
THE DEVICE.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.751
BUT IT'S IN
THE WAN ZAI BUNKER

08:10.794 --> 08:12.100
AND I'VE LOST
MY CLEARANCE.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.885
WHEN HAVE LOCKS
STOPPED US?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.935
ACCORDING TO HENRY'S DAD,
JACOB SLOAN USED THIS MAP

08:20.978 --> 08:23.894
TO DECIDE WHERE TO RING
THE YUELING BELL IN 1906.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.896
ASSUMING TAN'S FOLLOWING
IN SLOAN'S FOOTSTEPS,

08:25.940 --> 08:28.290
HE'S GONNA RING THE BELL
IN ONE OF THESE HOTSPOTS.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.596
I NEED YOU TWO
TO CROSS-REFERENCE

08:29.639 --> 08:30.771
TAN'S REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS,

08:30.814 --> 08:31.815
SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY MATCHES.

08:31.859 --> 08:32.947
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ON IT.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.601
THANK YOU.
ALTHEA,

08:34.644 --> 08:36.080
ANY LUCK ON
JULIETTE'S PHONE?

08:36.124 --> 08:38.518
[SIGH] SORRY.
THIS PHONE'S MEGA-ENCRYPTED.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.606
I'LL KEEP TRYING.

08:43.435 --> 08:44.915
NADIA: EVAN?
EVAN: YEAH.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.395
THIS WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN HELPING YOU,

08:46.438 --> 08:47.570
I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST ROOTING OUT

08:47.614 --> 08:49.093
CORRUPTION IN THE CITY.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.573
SO, WHAT'S
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT

08:50.617 --> 08:52.183
ANCIENT BELLS AND 1906

08:52.227 --> 08:54.272
AND STOPPING
AN EARTHQUAKE?

08:54.316 --> 08:58.146
UH, LOOK, NADIA...
WE MAKE IT THROUGH TODAY,

08:58.189 --> 09:00.801
I PROMISE I WILL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU,

09:00.844 --> 09:03.194
BUT RIGHT NOW...

09:03.238 --> 09:04.413
WE GOTTA FOCUS.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.501
YEAH.

09:08.678 --> 09:12.464
[PHONE RINGING]

09:12.508 --> 09:13.683
DENNIS, I TOLD YOU IT'S

09:13.727 --> 09:15.032
REALLY NOT
A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.034
BABE, I KNOW,
BUT I JUST CAME BACK

09:17.078 --> 09:18.427
FROM THE OFFICE
AND I THINK

09:18.470 --> 09:19.428
YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.429
HEAR WHAT?

09:20.472 --> 09:21.691
IT'S ABOUT YOUR APP.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.258
COURTNEY WAS
ONBOARDING ME

09:23.301 --> 09:24.999
AND SHE GAVE ME
A LOOK UNDER THE HOOD.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.479
ALTHEA: AND?
DENNIS: AND...

09:27.523 --> 09:29.307
THERE'S A FLAW
IN OUR CODE.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.744
TURNS OUT IT GIVES US

09:30.787 --> 09:32.397
UNAUTHORIZED BACKDOOR ACCESS

09:32.441 --> 09:34.051
TO OUR USERS'
OPERATING SYSTEMS.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.662
UH, DENNIS?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.142
THAT'S ILLEGAL.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.057
HOW COULD THIS
EVEN HAPPEN?

09:40.101 --> 09:41.276
REMEMBER YOUR CODER--DAWN?

09:41.319 --> 09:42.364
THE ONE YOU
PUT IN CHARGE OF

09:42.407 --> 09:43.495
PRIVACY, SECURITY,

09:43.539 --> 09:44.627
AND USER PERMISSIONS?

09:44.671 --> 09:45.672
I GAVE HER
RESPONSIBILITIES

09:45.715 --> 09:46.934
AND EMPOWERED HER.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.370
I DIDN'T TELL HER
TO TURN MY APP

09:48.413 --> 09:50.241
INTO A TROJAN HORSE
FOR ILLEGAL SPYWARE!

09:50.285 --> 09:52.026
I DON'T THINK IT WAS
INTENTIONAL, ALTHEA.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.463
OH, GOD.
WE ARE AT MARKET NOW.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.683
IF THIS GETS OUT, I WILL
NEVER WORK IN TECH AGAIN

09:56.726 --> 09:58.728
AND WE WILL BE SUED
INTO OBLIVION.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.556
COURTNEY'S LOOKING
FOR A FIX.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.819
BUT EVERY SECOND
WE STAY ON THE MARKET,

10:02.863 --> 10:03.951
WE'RE RISKING
SOMEONE DISCOVERING

10:03.994 --> 10:05.561
THE PRIVACY VIOLATION.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.519
BABE, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

10:07.563 --> 10:09.043
I DON'T KNOW, DENNIS.
