<i>Previously on
"Devious Maids"...</i>

00:02.208 --> 00:04.824
- Who are you?
- I'm Jesse. I'm Marisol's maid.

00:04.859 --> 00:06.744
Every time I see him,
I have to remind myself

00:06.779 --> 00:08.360
to look in his eyes
and not in his chest.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.279
Just so you know,
I can hear everything.

00:12.281 --> 00:14.064
- I thought Ernesto was dead...
- Mm-hmm.

00:14.066 --> 00:15.399
So I married someone else.

00:15.401 --> 00:17.567
Because your first husband
never really died,

00:17.569 --> 00:19.403
you're actually
still married to him.

00:19.405 --> 00:21.905
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- No, you don't have to do that.

00:21.907 --> 00:23.290
It's safer this way.

00:23.292 --> 00:24.524
I have to leave next week

00:24.526 --> 00:26.326
for a 6-month fellowship
in Greece.

00:26.328 --> 00:27.744
Would you come with me?

00:27.746 --> 00:29.096
Of course I will.

00:29.098 --> 00:30.931
- What?!
- Aah!

00:30.933 --> 00:32.299
Why are you taking medicine?

00:32.301 --> 00:35.469
Because sometimes
grown-ups get sad,

00:35.471 --> 00:39.840
and these pills make us
feel happy again.

00:39.842 --> 00:41.341
I don't trust you.

00:41.343 --> 00:42.843
You're in a world of trouble,
Taylor,

00:42.845 --> 00:46.179
and whatever happened,
it's gonna come out.

00:46.181 --> 00:49.483
Oh, my God. Taylor? Taylor?!

00:49.485 --> 00:52.269
This whole S&M thing...
I don't wanna do it anymore.

00:52.271 --> 00:53.854
Now I assumed neither of you

00:53.856 --> 00:56.773
would want your tawdry affair
to be public knowledge.

00:56.775 --> 00:58.325
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:58.327 --> 01:01.528
And the safe word will be
"blackmail."

01:01.530 --> 01:02.946
What is that?

01:02.948 --> 01:04.831
Something to put
a little extra...

01:04.833 --> 01:07.534
[Electricity crackles]
...spark into our sessions.

01:10.789 --> 01:12.205
[Exhales deeply]

01:12.207 --> 01:15.175
Okay. Let her rip!

01:15.177 --> 01:16.843
I'm not doing this.

01:16.845 --> 01:18.211
Carmen.

01:18.213 --> 01:20.047
Do I have to go
over this again?

01:20.049 --> 01:23.300
If you and Sebastien wanna
keep your affair a secret,

01:23.302 --> 01:25.719
you'll do as I ask.

01:25.721 --> 01:27.471
Now electrocute me!

01:27.473 --> 01:29.473
<i>Que viejo verde asqueroso!</i>

01:29.475 --> 01:32.642
Shame I didn't understand that.
Sounded positively scathing.

01:32.644 --> 01:35.729
Mr. Powell, I'm no expert,
but doesn't this seem dangerous?

01:35.731 --> 01:38.532
Extremely. That's the point.

01:38.534 --> 01:39.983
Tell you what.

01:39.985 --> 01:41.902
I'm gonna punish you
by <i> not</i> doing this.

01:41.904 --> 01:46.707
You've been naughty,
so no shock for you, <i>niño</i>.

01:46.709 --> 01:51.161
I truly admire your thinking,
but no, you're doing this.

01:51.163 --> 01:54.464
Now flip that switch
and turn up the dial.

01:55.918 --> 01:57.334
[Sighs]

01:57.336 --> 02:02.336
[Electricity humming]

02:02.925 --> 02:05.425
Ooh! Oh, ho! Ah! Ah! Oh!

02:05.427 --> 02:08.395
[Click, humming stops]
Ohh! Why'd you stop?

02:08.396 --> 02:10.680
You were going,
"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"

02:10.681 --> 02:11.965
Because I liked it!

02:11.967 --> 02:13.734
Let's crank up
the intensity a bit.

02:13.736 --> 02:15.235
No.

02:15.237 --> 02:17.854
Oh, for God's sake!
You're exasperating!

02:17.856 --> 02:21.241
No wonder Sebastien won't
leave his wife for you.

02:23.278 --> 02:24.778
You're just saying that
to make me mad,

02:24.780 --> 02:27.447
so I'll torture you.

02:27.449 --> 02:29.533
Honestly, Carmen, if I wanted
you to torture me,

02:29.535 --> 02:32.869
I'd ask you to sing.

02:32.871 --> 02:34.788
[Click, electricity humming,
crack]

02:34.790 --> 02:36.590
[Gasps] Aah!

02:36.592 --> 02:38.792
Oh, my God!
Uhh!

02:38.794 --> 02:41.128
[Grunting]

02:41.130 --> 02:46.099
[Electricity powers down]

02:46.101 --> 02:48.969
Mr. Powell!

02:48.971 --> 02:50.570

He's not dead, is he?

03:00.482 --> 03:02.315
He's got a pulse...
unfortunately.

03:02.317 --> 03:05.152
I can't believe you're still
doing this crazy crap with him.

03:05.154 --> 03:06.736
You said you were done.

03:06.738 --> 03:09.573
Sebastien, the ambulance
is gonna be here any minute.

03:09.575 --> 03:11.825
Now can we fight
while you're helping me?

03:13.512 --> 03:15.781
He was blackmailing you?
Son of a bitch!

03:15.798 --> 03:17.454
And he was gonna
both of us fired.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.166
And I know how much
you need this listing.

03:19.168 --> 03:20.967
[Thud]

03:22.170 --> 03:24.906
You should all that to protect me.
You must really care about me.

03:24.941 --> 03:27.257
- Of course I care about you.
- You don't act like it!

03:27.259 --> 03:29.309
'Cause I'm trying
not to get hurt

03:29.311 --> 03:31.178
because you're never gonna
leave your wife.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.429
Are you?

[Siren wailing in distance]

<i>[Woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over P.A.]</i>

03:44.559 --> 03:48.061
Marisol. I got here as fast
as I could. How's Taylor?

03:48.063 --> 03:52.348
They pumped her stomach.
She's under observation now.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.267
[Sighs]

03:54.269 --> 03:57.437
Sweetheart, are you all right?

03:57.439 --> 03:59.205
When can I see Mommy?

03:59.207 --> 04:00.907
She's not feeling well.

04:00.909 --> 04:03.109
But she's gonna be okay. Right?

04:03.111 --> 04:04.444
She is.

04:04.446 --> 04:06.613
Katy, can you stay here
for a minute?

04:06.615 --> 04:08.715
I need to talk to your dad.

04:08.717 --> 04:11.451
[Telephone ringing in distance]

04:12.453 --> 04:13.920
What is it?

04:13.922 --> 04:16.956
They ordered a psych evaluation
for Taylor.

04:16.958 --> 04:20.459
Oh, God. Guess it's standard
procedure for a suicide attempt.

04:20.462 --> 04:22.295
Is there no chance that
this could be an accident?

04:22.297 --> 04:24.130
They don't think so, not with
the amount of pills she took.

04:24.132 --> 04:26.966
This is my fault.

04:26.968 --> 04:29.435
We had a big fight.
I spent the night in a hotel.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.803
- Oh.
- I was angry. I was jealous.

04:30.805 --> 04:34.307
I said... things.

04:34.309 --> 04:35.775
[Voice breaks] But I love her.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.143
- I never meant to hurt her.
- No, of course not.

04:38.813 --> 04:40.313
I need a favor.

04:40.315 --> 04:42.732
Since Blanca took off,
I have no one to watch Katy.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.651
I don't wanna leave her
with a stranger.

04:44.653 --> 04:46.119
Say no more.
I'm glad to help.

04:46.121 --> 04:47.987
Just for the day,
while I deal with all this.

04:47.989 --> 04:50.073
And I'll help you find
a replacement for Blanca, too...

04:50.075 --> 04:52.792
someone full-time,
take the pressure off.

04:52.794 --> 04:55.628
Thank you. If there's anything
I can ever do to return...

04:55.630 --> 04:58.164
There is.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.167
Whatever made Taylor do this,

please don't let it happen
again.

[Gasps] Adrian? Oh, my God!

05:09.811 --> 05:11.511
Did you get my message?

05:11.513 --> 05:13.980
The paramedics think Mr. Powell
had some kind of seizure.

05:13.982 --> 05:15.682
Is he gonna be all right?

05:15.684 --> 05:18.351
He's stable for now. They'll run
more tests at the hospital.

05:18.353 --> 05:19.686
I'm coming with you.

05:19.688 --> 05:21.020
[Monitor beeping steadily]

05:21.022 --> 05:22.655
I'm sure he'll be okay.

05:22.657 --> 05:24.190
I don't understand.

05:24.192 --> 05:25.858
Why would he have had a seizure
out of the blue?

05:25.860 --> 05:28.469
I don't know. Sometimes
these things just happen.

05:28.470 --> 05:30.652
Well perhaps to
the elderly and infirm.

05:30.653 --> 05:33.227
But Adrian has was always
being so vital and fit.

05:33.262 --> 05:34.701
He's not <i> that</i> fit.

05:34.703 --> 05:37.704
Carmen, I wanna thank you for
handling this in my absence.

05:37.706 --> 05:39.789
If you hadn't been here
to find him,

05:39.791 --> 05:41.541
God only knows
what would've happened.

05:41.543 --> 05:43.376
That's all right.
You don't have to thank me.

05:43.378 --> 05:45.294
No. When Adrian's recovered,

05:45.296 --> 05:48.014
I am going to make sure that he
knows that you saved his life.

05:48.016 --> 05:50.133
He will probably be shocked.

05:50.135 --> 05:51.968
Oh. Definitely.

05:51.970 --> 05:54.687
Carmen, you're an angel.

05:54.689 --> 05:57.991
You are an absolute...

Now you be good,

06:16.411 --> 06:19.829
I guess he's trying to look cool
in front of his father.

06:19.831 --> 06:21.781
He already looks up to you.

06:21.783 --> 06:24.784
Only because I bribe him
with pizza. [Chuckles]

06:24.786 --> 06:28.638
Rosita, before you leave,
I wanted to give you a present.

06:30.091 --> 06:31.924
What is it for?

06:31.926 --> 06:35.011
Just wanted to do something nice
since today's our anniversary.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.316
You forgot.

06:40.318 --> 06:44.153
I'm sorry.
It's... it's been a long time.

06:44.155 --> 06:47.073
Well, I remember
like it was yesterday.

06:47.075 --> 06:49.909
You wore a flower like this
in your hair.

06:49.911 --> 06:53.913
[Chuckles] And you were
wearing your father's old suit.

06:53.915 --> 06:56.332
You had a smile on
your face like...

06:56.334 --> 06:58.418
[Chuckles]

06:58.420 --> 07:00.253
Like that.

07:02.757 --> 07:06.225
And we pledged our lives
to each other that day,

07:06.227 --> 07:09.429
in front of our families
and in front of God.

07:09.431 --> 07:12.732
[Sighs] I can't accept this.

07:12.734 --> 07:16.853
It's a gift,
and I'm not taking it back.

07:20.442 --> 07:22.024
Okay, so what do you take
on your sandwich?

07:22.026 --> 07:25.611
Turkey? PB&J?

07:25.613 --> 07:28.614
- Katy?
- I don't know.

07:28.616 --> 07:33.536
Well, how did Blanca
usually make it for you?

07:33.538 --> 07:37.874
[Sighs]

07:37.876 --> 07:39.876
Your dad says
you really miss her.

07:39.878 --> 07:43.212

Just...

07:53.808 --> 07:55.942
[Ring, beep] Hello?

07:55.944 --> 07:58.311
Hey, it's me.
I didn't see you this morning.

07:58.313 --> 07:59.729
You got some missed calls.

07:59.731 --> 08:01.647
I'll check my voice-mail.
Thanks, Jesse.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.450
No worries. When do you think
you'll be home?

08:04.452 --> 08:07.320
How late do you think
you'll be there?

08:07.322 --> 08:09.122
5:00-ish?

08:09.124 --> 08:12.241
Definitely not before then,
so guess I'll miss you.

08:12.243 --> 08:15.328
You're not... you're not
avoiding me, are you?

08:15.330 --> 08:16.829
Why would I be avoiding you?

08:16.831 --> 08:18.164
I overheard you saying
all that stuff about me,

08:18.166 --> 08:19.499
but I told you, it's...

08:19.501 --> 08:22.335
- My friend's in the hospital.
- What?

08:22.337 --> 08:24.637
My friend Taylor...
she's in the hospital,

08:24.639 --> 08:27.140
so I agreed to watch
her daughter for the day.

08:27.142 --> 08:31.144
[Sighs] Well,
now I feel like a jerk.

08:31.146 --> 08:34.147
It's all right. You didn't know.
But see? Not avoiding you.

08:34.149 --> 08:37.183
Okay. I-I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

08:37.184 --> 08:40.186
No, just, uh,
hold down the fort,

08:40.188 --> 08:44.524
and I will see you
when I see you.

08:44.526 --> 08:45.858

08:45.860 --> 08:47.326
Oh! [Laughs]

it was sweet of you to call.

Oh. [Strained voice]
Someone's at the door.

08:53.201 --> 08:55.001
Honey, I gotta go.

08:55.003 --> 08:59.038

Give my love to Remi.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.090

It's Reina! Zoila's sister?

09:12.136 --> 09:15.721
Sorry. Zoila no work here!

09:15.723 --> 09:19.725
Very funny.
I know it's you. Let me in!

09:26.100 --> 09:29.435
God! [Laughs]

09:29.437 --> 09:31.404
How long has it been?

09:31.406 --> 09:33.406
Reina.
What are you doing here?

09:33.408 --> 09:36.742
Can't I just pop in for a visit?
[Door closes]

09:36.744 --> 09:39.545
Last time I saw you,
you stole my car.

09:39.547 --> 09:41.914
It was a used Saturn.
You can barely call that a car.

09:41.916 --> 09:43.583
Look, it's not a good time.

09:43.585 --> 09:45.585
I don't know if you can tell,
but... [Clicks tongue]

09:45.587 --> 09:47.086
I'm pregnant.

09:47.088 --> 09:48.588
You can definitely tell.

09:48.590 --> 09:50.840
And actually,
that's why I'm here.

09:50.842 --> 09:53.009
I heard about
your little bun in the oven...

09:53.011 --> 09:55.595
[Sighs]
...and I wanted to help out.

09:55.597 --> 09:56.896
Who told you?

09:56.898 --> 09:59.015
Valentina posted it
on Facebook.

09:59.017 --> 10:02.435
And... I just think
it's amazing.

10:02.437 --> 10:04.070
Amazing because I'm so old?

10:04.072 --> 10:06.856
No, because you're such
a good mom.

10:06.858 --> 10:11.025
Oh. Well... that's... nice.

10:12.247 --> 10:13.613
Look...

10:13.615 --> 10:17.617
I'd invite you to stay,
but it's not my house,

10:17.619 --> 10:19.952
and Genevieve hates it
when I have guests.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.622
Mm-hmm, well, good thing
she's in Mykonos.

10:22.624 --> 10:25.424
Seriously, girl, you're, like,
the only person not on Facebook.

10:25.426 --> 10:27.543
[Laughs]

10:27.545 --> 10:32.431
Now come on. Help me
get my bags out of the car.

10:32.433 --> 10:33.799
It's <i> my</i> car!

10:33.801 --> 10:35.768
Zoila, sisters share.

10:41.304 --> 10:44.505
- Thanks for meeting me.
- No, thank <i> you.</i>

10:44.507 --> 10:46.573
I needed an excuse
to get away from my sister.

10:46.575 --> 10:48.509
I didn't even realize
you had a sister.

10:48.511 --> 10:50.210
You never talk about her.

10:50.212 --> 10:52.546
Because she's an evil <i> bruja.</i>

10:52.548 --> 10:55.632
My whole life, everything I had,
she always wanted it.

10:55.634 --> 10:58.218
- Wow. She sounds terrible.
- She is.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.653
God must really hate me.

11:03.325 --> 11:04.892
What's up with you?

11:04.894 --> 11:08.812
[Sighs] Y-you don't think
that's true, do you?

11:08.814 --> 11:11.198
That God hates you?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.484
It's a figure of speech.
Why would God hate me?

11:13.486 --> 11:15.903
Well, you were with Javi when
you were still married to Pablo.

11:15.905 --> 11:19.406
That's adultery,
rule number seven on God's list.

11:19.408 --> 11:21.825
<i>Ah.</i>
I see what this is.

11:21.827 --> 11:25.579
Honey, you didn't know
Ernesto was alive,

11:25.581 --> 11:29.416
and so you're married
to Spence now. It's okay.

11:29.418 --> 11:32.920
My priest says I'm still married
to Ernesto in the eyes of God.

11:32.922 --> 11:34.388
Oh, boy.

11:34.390 --> 11:36.390
I can't even have sex
with Spence.

11:36.392 --> 11:39.009
I keep thinking,
Is God going to strike me down?

11:39.011 --> 11:41.011
Oh, come on.
God doesn't do that.

11:41.013 --> 11:43.931
Well, you're not exactly
the world's best Catholic.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.933
Putting aside God
for a moment...

11:45.935 --> 11:48.735
who do <i> you</i> wanna be with?

11:48.737 --> 11:51.605
I love them both. You pick.

11:51.607 --> 11:54.241
No. I can't do that.
You've gotta choose.

11:54.243 --> 11:57.611
[Sighs] But if you follow your
heart, God will understand.

11:57.613 --> 12:01.365
Then Spence.

12:01.367 --> 12:06.019
I...choose... Spence.

12:07.923 --> 12:12.126
See? I told you.
God's fine with it.

12:12.128 --> 12:13.961
You don't have to worry.

12:13.963 --> 12:16.380
Wait. Where you going?

12:16.382 --> 12:18.549
To break rule number seven
with Spence.

12:18.551 --> 12:19.933
Maybe a few times.

12:23.139 --> 12:24.938
I had a seizure?
[Monitor beeping steadily]

12:24.940 --> 12:27.474
You're lucky Carmen was there
to call the paramedics.

12:27.476 --> 12:31.111
Adrian, how did this happen?
What were you doing?

12:31.113 --> 12:32.312
I don't recall.

12:32.314 --> 12:34.648
What did Carmen say
I was doing?

12:34.650 --> 12:37.151
She said she found you
on the sofa in the study.

12:37.153 --> 12:39.736
Oh. Then there you have it.
[Door opens]

12:39.738 --> 12:41.655
Mr. Powell, how you feeling?

12:41.657 --> 12:43.157
Better, thanks. When can I go home?
[Door closes]

12:43.159 --> 12:44.658
First, I need to ask you about

12:44.660 --> 12:46.460
the wounds we found
on your body.

12:46.462 --> 12:48.162
What wounds?

12:48.164 --> 12:51.248
We found bruising on his back,
thighs, and buttocks.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.333
Can you explain
how they got there?

12:53.335 --> 12:54.835
I'd prefer not to.

12:54.837 --> 12:57.337
You son of a <i> bitch!</i>
I could wring your neck.

12:57.339 --> 12:58.922
Mrs. Powell, that's enough.

12:58.924 --> 13:01.175
Your husband's wounds
are consistent with abuse.

13:01.177 --> 13:04.011
So I have to ask,
are you beating him?

13:04.013 --> 13:07.981
For God's sake!
Adrian, tell him the truth.

13:09.685 --> 13:11.518
- She's beating me.
- Adrian!

13:11.520 --> 13:13.353
All right. I only wish
she was beating me.

13:13.355 --> 13:16.190
The truth is...

13:16.192 --> 13:18.325
I'm into S&M.

13:18.327 --> 13:21.862
- It's my fun little hobby.
- I see.

13:21.864 --> 13:23.363
Did you go back to that
disgusting sex club again?

13:23.365 --> 13:25.616
Adrian,
you cannot do this anymore.

13:25.618 --> 13:28.202
- Do you hear me? Never again.
- Your wife's right.

13:28.204 --> 13:30.454
Your blood pressure
is through the roof.

13:30.456 --> 13:33.207
This hobby is putting
terrible stress on your body.

13:33.209 --> 13:35.842
- You have to quit.
- Cold turkey?

13:35.844 --> 13:37.511
Not even a few nipple clamps?

13:37.513 --> 13:39.296
Oh, dear God.

13:39.298 --> 13:40.797
Everything.

13:40.799 --> 13:43.383
Mr. Powell,
you had a seizure today.

13:43.385 --> 13:46.053
Keep it up, you're at risk
for heart attack and stroke.

13:46.055 --> 13:48.822
Your little hobby
could be fatal.

13:50.926 --> 13:52.226
[Book thuds]

13:54.480 --> 13:57.314
[Sighs]

13:57.316 --> 13:58.982
Tough day?
[Gasps]

13:58.984 --> 14:02.236
Jesse.
You're still here.

14:02.238 --> 14:03.904
I am. Is that all right?

14:03.906 --> 14:05.572
I just...
Well, I wasn't expecting you.

14:05.574 --> 14:06.907
I thought you'd be gone by now.

14:06.909 --> 14:08.575
I figured you'd be tired,

14:08.577 --> 14:12.605
so I thought I'd stay late
and make you... dinner.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.916
What?

14:15.918 --> 14:18.585
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

14:18.587 --> 14:20.420
I hope you like lasagna.

14:20.422 --> 14:23.590
That's kind of the only thing
I can make.

14:23.592 --> 14:26.677
Oh, my God.
You didn't have to do this.

14:26.679 --> 14:30.097
I know... but I wanted to.

14:33.352 --> 14:35.852
- Wine?
- Yes, please.

14:35.854 --> 14:37.771
This is so sweet.

14:37.773 --> 14:39.573
Now I feel like
I'm not paying you enough.

14:39.575 --> 14:41.441
Stop.

14:41.443 --> 14:42.693
If you leave the dishes
in the sink,

14:42.695 --> 14:44.911
I'll clean 'em up tomorrow.

14:46.949 --> 14:49.950
Hey, uh, Jesse...

14:49.952 --> 14:51.952
do you wanna stay
and have dinner with me?

14:51.954 --> 14:54.788
I'd love to,

14:54.790 --> 14:57.291
unless you want to unwind
by yourself.

14:57.293 --> 15:00.460
After the day I've had,
it'd be nice to talk to someone.

15:00.462 --> 15:03.547
Cool.
I'll grab an extra plate.

15:03.549 --> 15:05.132
Okay.

15:07.469 --> 15:11.388
It's time for bed, honey.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.273
Is that a card for Mommy?

15:13.275 --> 15:16.777
Well, let's give it to her
at the hospital tomorrow, okay?

15:16.779 --> 15:18.945
Can I have five more minutes
to finish?

15:18.947 --> 15:21.815
Sure. But then
it's bedtime, okay?

15:21.817 --> 15:24.951
All right. Mwah!
I'll go get your room ready.

15:27.489 --> 15:29.656
[Sighs]

15:37.966 --> 15:41.051
[Rattling]

15:48.010 --> 15:49.760
These were in your room.

15:49.762 --> 15:52.429
Why did you have them?

15:52.431 --> 15:55.682
Katy, tell me.

15:55.684 --> 15:58.852
Mommy was sad.

15:58.854 --> 16:02.272
I put them in her drink
so she would feel better.

16:02.274 --> 16:04.191
What?

16:04.193 --> 16:07.194
You almost killed her!

16:07.196 --> 16:08.945
I'm sorry.

16:08.947 --> 16:10.197
Do you have any idea
what we've done for you,

16:10.199 --> 16:11.998
how much we've risked?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.917
What's wrong with you?!

16:19.708 --> 16:21.007
[Under breath] Damn it.

16:21.009 --> 16:24.878
I mean, It's just hard to believe that
Taylor would try to kill herself.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.713
It's not like her.

16:26.715 --> 16:28.048
Did she have a reason?

16:28.050 --> 16:31.134
Well, she's been under
a lot of stress lately.

16:31.136 --> 16:33.186
Sounds like their marriage
is on the rocks.

16:33.188 --> 16:36.890
And that little girl
they adopted is kinda...

16:36.892 --> 16:38.141
What?

16:38.143 --> 16:40.143
No, I feel awful saying it.

16:40.145 --> 16:42.312
Well, now you <i> have</i> to say it.

16:42.314 --> 16:43.647
[Glass thuds]

16:43.649 --> 16:44.898
Creepy.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.701
Katy's a little bit creepy.

16:47.703 --> 16:51.071
Well, you know, in my unit,
we had this guy, Crocker,

16:51.073 --> 16:53.323
and everyone thought
<i>he</i> was creepy.

16:53.325 --> 16:56.159
But it turns out that he'd just
seen some scary stuff, you know?

16:56.161 --> 16:58.879
He was really just afraid.

16:58.881 --> 17:00.163
Oh, my God.

17:00.165 --> 17:01.882
Now I feel like a jerk.

17:01.884 --> 17:04.667
No, no. You probably just had
a little too much to drink.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.252
I swear, I don't normally

17:06.255 --> 17:08.839
go around talking trash
about little kids.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.257
I'm not a bad person.

17:10.259 --> 17:13.894
Actually, I think you're
a really good person.

17:13.896 --> 17:16.179
[Laughs] You barely know me.

17:16.181 --> 17:17.597
Still, I can tell...

17:17.598 --> 17:19.516
the way that you love
your friends,

17:19.518 --> 17:22.903
the fact that you started your
business just to help people.

17:22.905 --> 17:25.105
That's nice of you to say.

17:25.107 --> 17:27.741
I mean it.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.242
You're amazing.

17:29.244 --> 17:32.279
[Sighs]

17:38.287 --> 17:40.921
It's getting late.
I should... I should go.

17:40.923 --> 17:42.539
You don't have to.

17:42.541 --> 17:45.041
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:47.796 --> 17:49.463
[Door closes]

17:49.465 --> 17:51.131
[Exhales deeply]

17:51.133 --> 17:53.633
[Thunderclap]

17:53.635 --> 17:56.136
Rosie?

17:56.138 --> 17:58.104
<i>Hola, papi.</i>

17:58.106 --> 18:00.474
Wow.

18:00.476 --> 18:02.309
You look really hot.

18:02.311 --> 18:04.644
[Chuckles] Thanks.

18:04.646 --> 18:09.065
You look really... wet.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.818
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's,
um, it's pouring outside.

18:11.820 --> 18:16.072
Hmm.
I've been waiting for you.

18:16.074 --> 18:18.408
Uh, what's...
what's happening here?

18:18.410 --> 18:23.330
I'm just... getting you out
of these wet clothes.

18:23.332 --> 18:27.167
Don't want you to catch a cold.

18:27.169 --> 18:28.585
Mmm.
Mmm.

18:28.587 --> 18:31.505
[Both moan and laugh]

18:31.507 --> 18:34.307
This is unexpected.

18:34.309 --> 18:36.810
Miguel's still at Ernesto's.

18:36.812 --> 18:41.097
And we have the whole apartment
to ourselves.

18:44.987 --> 18:49.757
I know I haven't been
very romantic lately.

18:50.275 --> 18:52.158
Do you think you could
forgive me?

18:52.160 --> 18:54.444
You know what?
I think that I can.

18:54.446 --> 18:57.697
Mmm.

18:57.699 --> 19:00.867
Mmm.
God, that feels great.

19:00.869 --> 19:02.836
Shh.

19:02.838 --> 19:05.455
I'm glad. Please don't talk
about God right now, okay?

19:05.457 --> 19:07.674
Oh, yeah.
Whatever you want.

19:07.676 --> 19:10.677
I love you, Spence.

19:10.679 --> 19:15.215
I love you, too.

19:15.217 --> 19:18.518
Mmm. Mmm.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.220
[Breathing heavily]

19:20.222 --> 19:21.555
[Thunderclap]

19:21.557 --> 19:24.558
Aah! What was that?

19:24.560 --> 19:26.893
Lightning. Yeah,
I think it hit the building.

19:26.895 --> 19:29.062
We got struck by lightning?

19:29.064 --> 19:30.730
Yeah, I guess we did.

19:30.732 --> 19:32.198
Oh!

19:32.200 --> 19:33.650
[Thud]

19:33.652 --> 19:35.869
[Gasps] Rosie, what the hell?

19:35.871 --> 19:39.906
I'm sorry.
I'm <i> so,</i> so sorry.

19:39.908 --> 19:41.658
[Thunderclap]

19:44.509 --> 19:47.630
Katy? Sweetheart, wake up.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.930
We're going to see Mommy.

19:50.932 --> 19:52.565
Katy?

20:07.032 --> 20:09.866
Katy?

20:09.868 --> 20:11.201
What are you doing here?

20:14.339 --> 20:16.956
[Sighs] Katy, it's very early.

20:16.958 --> 20:20.510
I'm gonna require coffee
for this interaction.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.128
Would you like some?

20:22.130 --> 20:24.214
Kids don't drink coffee.

20:24.216 --> 20:27.383
Oh, good. She speaks.

20:27.385 --> 20:29.803
Now tell me why you're
loitering at my front door

20:29.805 --> 20:31.187
like a vagabond.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.223
I ran away.

20:33.225 --> 20:36.559
Wow.

20:36.561 --> 20:37.977
That's very dramatic.

20:37.979 --> 20:40.313
[Grunts]

20:40.315 --> 20:42.398
Why did you run away?

20:45.570 --> 20:49.939
Daddy doesn't want me anymore.

20:49.941 --> 20:53.409
Well, I am sure
that isn't true.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.214
[Crying]

20:58.216 --> 21:01.384
It's all right, darling.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.754
[Continues crying]

21:04.756 --> 21:08.925
Everything is
going to be just...

21:08.927 --> 21:11.761
[Whispers] fine.

21:11.763 --> 21:13.596
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:13.598 --> 21:17.767
Zoila, where do you keep
the laundry detergent?!

21:17.769 --> 21:21.771
In the cabinet above the washer!

21:21.773 --> 21:23.940
It's not there!

21:29.698 --> 21:31.114
[Grunts]

21:31.116 --> 21:33.867
Oh, never mind! I found it!

21:38.707 --> 21:40.924
[Grunts]

21:40.926 --> 21:43.960
Zoila, where do you keep
the fabric softener?!

21:43.962 --> 21:45.428
[Groans]

21:45.430 --> 21:47.597
See? You were always better
at this stuff.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.432
I guess that's why you love
being a maid.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.968
Yep, I'm living the dream.

21:51.970 --> 21:54.103
You know, I wanna tell you,
I'm really sorry about Pablo.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.638
I always liked him.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.891
- You didn't come to the funeral.
- I wasn't invited.

21:57.893 --> 21:59.442
You don't send invitations
to a funeral.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.444
How was I supposed to
know that?

22:01.446 --> 22:04.397
Well, at least a little bit
of Pablo still lives on.

22:04.399 --> 22:06.449
[Loudly] Am I having
a niece or a nephew?

22:06.451 --> 22:08.067
Yeah, one of those.

22:08.069 --> 22:10.570
[Scoffs] You don't know?

22:10.572 --> 22:14.157
Zoila, you don't seem
very excited about this baby.

22:14.159 --> 22:16.326
What are you talking about?
I'm... over the moon.

22:16.328 --> 22:17.794
Oh, come on. You can't fool me.
When you were pregnant

22:17.796 --> 22:19.128
with Valentina,
you were different.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.080
Of course I was different.

22:21.082 --> 22:23.633
I was a newlywed. I had
my whole life ahead of me.

22:23.635 --> 22:24.918
Well, I'm just saying,
you might be old and single now,

22:24.920 --> 22:26.169
but you shouldn't take it out
on the baby.

22:26.171 --> 22:27.937
- When are you going home?
- Excuse me?

22:27.939 --> 22:29.422
You said you were here to help,

22:29.424 --> 22:31.758
but all you do
is criticize me and pester me

22:31.760 --> 22:35.178
and make me do <i> your</i> laundry.

22:35.180 --> 22:38.348
- When are you going home?
- I can't.

22:38.350 --> 22:40.984
What are you talking about?

22:40.986 --> 22:43.186
Victor and I are getting
a divorce.

22:43.188 --> 22:46.239
[Crying]

22:49.361 --> 22:52.862
Okay. Okay.

22:52.864 --> 22:54.364
There, there.

22:54.366 --> 22:57.200
[Continues crying]

22:59.671 --> 23:02.088
So is it okay if I stay
for a while?

23:04.626 --> 23:06.042
[Tapping buttons]

23:06.044 --> 23:08.544
Hey.
Can I talk to you?

23:08.546 --> 23:11.714
Oh, yes, good. Carmen,
I need to talk to you, too.

23:11.716 --> 23:14.634
I put Adrian Powell
in the hospital.

23:14.636 --> 23:17.804
You first.

23:17.806 --> 23:20.189
Adrian was blackmailing you
to torture him?

23:20.191 --> 23:22.976
I tried to stop,
but he wouldn't listen.

23:22.978 --> 23:24.978
So please, don't be mad at me.

23:24.980 --> 23:27.363
Look, this may have started
as consensual,

23:27.365 --> 23:29.399
but ultimately,
you told Adrian "no."

23:29.401 --> 23:31.484
And he coerced you.
It's not right.

23:31.486 --> 23:33.569
Wow. I just thought you were
gonna yell at me a little.

23:33.571 --> 23:34.988
Why?

23:34.990 --> 23:37.240
<i>Because...</i>
the whole boss-employee thing.

23:37.242 --> 23:38.825
You're such a stickler
for the rules.

23:38.827 --> 23:41.711
Not lately.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.746
I kissed Jesse.

23:43.748 --> 23:45.381
<i>What?</i> You lucky bitch!

23:45.383 --> 23:48.835
No, no, it was wrong.

23:48.837 --> 23:50.920
As soon as I kissed him,
he said he had to go.

23:50.922 --> 23:52.672
He was <i> so</i> uncomfortable.

23:52.674 --> 23:54.590
Maybe you're a bad kisser.

23:54.592 --> 23:57.593
I mean, you look like a bad kisser.
I am not a bad kisser!

23:57.595 --> 23:59.762
I just...
I misread the situation.

23:59.764 --> 24:02.015
I thought he was
sending me signals.

24:02.017 --> 24:03.933
- What were the signals?
- He made dinner,

24:03.935 --> 24:06.736
he served wine,
he did the dishes.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.905
<i>Por supuesto,</i> he's your maid.

24:08.907 --> 24:11.357
- He told me I was amazing.
- So what?

24:11.359 --> 24:13.109
I tell all my bosses
they're amazing,

24:13.111 --> 24:15.111
especially if I want a raise.
[Chuckles]

24:15.113 --> 24:17.697
He was just being a good maid,
and I was being a predator.

24:17.699 --> 24:19.282
[Sighs]

24:19.284 --> 24:23.036
Oh, my God.
I'm Adrian Powell.

24:23.038 --> 24:25.121
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're a total perv.

24:25.123 --> 24:27.890
Now what am I gonna do about
the <i> real</i> Adrian Powell?

24:27.892 --> 24:30.209
I think I have an idea.

24:31.796 --> 24:36.132
[Crunching]

24:36.134 --> 24:38.801
Reina!

24:38.803 --> 24:40.303
You're making a mess!

24:40.305 --> 24:41.971
Well, excuse me.
I'm sad about Victor.

24:41.973 --> 24:43.973
You don't know what it's like
to lose a husband.

24:43.975 --> 24:46.309
Pablo's dead, and Javi left me
on my wedding day.

24:46.311 --> 24:49.395
God, Zoila, do you always
have to make it about you?

24:49.397 --> 24:52.815
[Sighs]

24:52.817 --> 24:56.569
Is there a chance
Victor will take you back?

24:56.571 --> 24:58.788
- Doubtful.
- Are you sure?

24:58.790 --> 25:00.456
I tried,
but he wouldn't listen.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.241
I guess you stuck with me
forever.

25:04.662 --> 25:08.164
[Door closes] Zoila, it is
great to see you, but...

25:08.166 --> 25:09.799
what are you doing here?

25:09.801 --> 25:12.135
Well, I heard about the divorce
from Reina,

25:12.137 --> 25:14.253
and I wanted to see
how <i> you</i> were doing.

25:14.255 --> 25:16.255
How's Victor?

25:16.257 --> 25:19.342
You know, you always hear
about divorce and...

25:19.344 --> 25:21.094
- How hard it is.
- Mm-hmm.

25:21.096 --> 25:23.479
But I'm doing great.

25:23.481 --> 25:25.098
Hmm.

25:28.186 --> 25:30.186
Well, maybe it hasn't
sunk in yet.

25:30.188 --> 25:31.821
Let me guess.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.607
She's staying with you,
and she's driving you nuts.

25:34.609 --> 25:36.609
What? No!

25:36.611 --> 25:38.528
I love my sister.

25:38.530 --> 25:40.780
In fact, I'm worried about her.

25:40.782 --> 25:43.366
She's devastated
about the breakup.

25:43.368 --> 25:46.502
I'm sorry she's in pain,
but I can't be with her anymore.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.037
Look, Reina can be difficult.

25:48.039 --> 25:49.839
Nobody knows that
better than I do.

25:49.841 --> 25:51.707
But she also has
many wonderful qualities.

25:51.709 --> 25:53.643
Like what?

25:53.645 --> 25:57.046
Mm, she's very beautiful.
And she's spunky. [Chuckles]

25:57.048 --> 26:01.384
But more importantly,
she loves the heck out of you.

26:01.386 --> 26:04.303
Did Reina tell you <i> why</i>
we're getting a divorce?

26:04.305 --> 26:06.889
- Just that you've grown apart.
- She cheated on me.

26:06.891 --> 26:10.560
Oh, I am so sorry.

26:10.562 --> 26:13.196
But are you really willing
to throw everything away

26:13.198 --> 26:14.697
because of one mistake?

26:14.699 --> 26:16.566
- More than one.
- She made a couple of mistakes.

26:16.568 --> 26:18.201
<i>Dozens</i> of mistakes.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.902
Okay, let's not get bogged down
in the number.

26:19.904 --> 26:22.371
The point is that she's
very, very, very sorry.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.540
Zoila...

26:24.542 --> 26:26.409
if you knew the whole story,

26:26.411 --> 26:28.494
you would not be defending her.

26:28.496 --> 26:30.079
Well, what's the whole story?

26:30.081 --> 26:35.001
[Sighs] One of the men
that Reina slept with...

26:35.003 --> 26:36.385
was Pablo.

26:36.387 --> 26:39.639
Pablo?

26:41.593 --> 26:44.060
<i>My</i> Pablo?

26:45.611 --> 26:47.660
Yes, it's Michael Stappord.

26:47.662 --> 26:50.170
Uh, yeah, I'm looking for
my little girl.

26:50.205 --> 26:51.516
Have... have you...

26:51.551 --> 26:53.916
have you seen her
wandering around at all?

26:53.918 --> 26:57.887
Never mind. I found her.
[Phone beep]

26:58.795 --> 27:02.290
- I believe you know this young lady.
- Oh, Everlyn, thank you.

27:02.991 --> 27:05.334
Katy, you scared me.
Are you all right?

27:06.611 --> 27:08.692
Katy? Katy!

27:12.324 --> 27:14.941
- Where did you find her?
- Actually, she found me.

27:15.995 --> 27:17.911
She's a lovely girl, Michael.

27:17.913 --> 27:20.747
You're very lucky to have her
in your life.

27:20.749 --> 27:22.082
I'm not really that great
with kids.

27:22.084 --> 27:25.168
It's more... Taylor's thing.

27:25.170 --> 27:28.255
You know, Adrian and I
discussed adopting

27:28.257 --> 27:29.756
after Barrett died.

27:29.758 --> 27:32.426
But... Adrian was against
the idea,

27:32.428 --> 27:34.261
so we never did anything
about it.

27:34.263 --> 27:37.564
I understand.
It's a lot to take on.

27:38.493 --> 27:40.860
The truth is, all children
are frustrating.

27:40.862 --> 27:43.112
And they ruin every nice thing
they touch.

27:44.999 --> 27:47.366
[Voice breaks]
But at the end of the day,

27:47.368 --> 27:49.335
they are a gift
to be cherished,

27:49.337 --> 27:52.705
because you never know
when they might leave you.

27:57.128 --> 27:58.794
[Door closes]

28:01.049 --> 28:03.049
What is this?

28:03.051 --> 28:05.217
It's a petition for annulment.

28:05.219 --> 28:08.471
We both sign this paper,
send it to the church

28:08.473 --> 28:12.141
to make it clear
we are not married anymore.

28:12.143 --> 28:14.193
You married another man.

28:14.195 --> 28:16.228
I think it's pretty clear.

28:16.230 --> 28:17.897
My priest says
that in the eyes of God,

28:17.899 --> 28:20.032
you are still my husband.

28:20.034 --> 28:22.368
[Chuckles] That's fantastic.

28:22.370 --> 28:24.153
No, it's not.

28:24.155 --> 28:27.073
I made a commitment to Spence,
and I am not going to break it.

28:27.075 --> 28:29.325
But the priest told you
it was wrong.

28:29.327 --> 28:31.544
That's why you have to
sign this,

28:31.546 --> 28:33.579
so I can get right with God.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.831
This says
our marriage wasn't real,

28:35.833 --> 28:40.669
that I tricked you
or forced you into it.

28:40.671 --> 28:42.922
That is not true.

28:42.924 --> 28:44.757
[Sighs]

28:44.759 --> 28:46.342
I know.

28:46.344 --> 28:48.794
Ernesto,<i> por favor.</i>

28:48.796 --> 28:51.097
I need you to release me.

28:51.099 --> 28:53.015
I understand.

28:53.017 --> 28:55.568
You feel guilty
and it's breaking your heart.

28:55.570 --> 28:57.853
Yes. Exactly.

28:57.855 --> 29:00.039
And that's why I'm gonna
help you.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.607
Thank you.

29:01.609 --> 29:02.942
What are you doing?

29:02.944 --> 29:04.944
You don't want me to sign this.

29:04.946 --> 29:06.946
Yes, I do.

29:06.948 --> 29:09.615
Then why did you come here,
asking me for <i> my</i> permission,

29:09.617 --> 29:12.118
which you know
I would never give?

29:12.120 --> 29:13.586
[Sighs]

29:13.588 --> 29:17.896
Why did you show up
looking so beautiful...

29:18.876 --> 29:20.793
it hurts my eyes?

29:20.795 --> 29:24.096
I don't know.

29:24.098 --> 29:26.465
But I have to listen
to my heart.

29:50.491 --> 29:52.575
What is your heart saying now?

29:56.998 --> 29:59.331
Zoila! I know you gave me money
for groceries,

29:59.333 --> 30:02.918
but I have to get a manicure.
Hope that's okay.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.588
You slept with Pablo?
How could you?

30:05.590 --> 30:07.423
Ew. Gross.
I didn't sleep with Pablo.

30:07.425 --> 30:09.592
I talked to Victor.

30:09.594 --> 30:11.844
Okay, I did it,
but it was years ago.

30:11.846 --> 30:13.345
You were barely even married.

30:13.347 --> 30:15.431
Yeah, sisters share,
but they don't share that.

30:15.433 --> 30:16.849
Zoila, please!

30:16.851 --> 30:18.434
Pablo was a bad guy.
<i>You</i> left <i> him!</i>

30:18.436 --> 30:20.519
Plus, he's dead now,
so who cares?

30:20.521 --> 30:23.155
This is about <i> you.</i>
I made my peace with Pablo.

30:23.157 --> 30:24.690
He may have been
a son of a bitch,

30:24.692 --> 30:26.826
but he was <i>my</i> son of a bitch!

30:26.828 --> 30:28.160
Listen, listen.

30:28.162 --> 30:32.031
I am so, so sorry
you found out.

30:32.033 --> 30:35.501
I always looked out for you.
Always!

30:35.503 --> 30:37.670
But all you do is take!

30:37.672 --> 30:40.873
My clothes!
My car! My husband!

30:40.875 --> 30:43.509
You're a leech, and I want
nothing to do with you.

30:43.511 --> 30:46.462
No, no! No, please! I don't have
anywhere else to go!

30:46.464 --> 30:49.715
I don't care. I want you
the hell outta here.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.852
Aah!

30:52.854 --> 30:55.387
Zoila! Zoila!

30:55.389 --> 30:57.022
Zoila.

30:57.024 --> 30:58.307
Oh!

31:05.918 --> 31:09.636
- Zoila, I am so, so sorry.
- Shh! Don't talk.

31:13.008 --> 31:15.058
<i>[Heartbeat whooshing]</i>
There we go.

31:15.060 --> 31:16.677
What does that mean?
The baby's okay?

31:16.679 --> 31:18.562
The baby is going to be
just fine.

31:18.564 --> 31:20.848
It just took you so long
to find a heartbeat.

31:20.850 --> 31:23.433
Yeah, sometimes it takes
a minute.

31:23.435 --> 31:25.686
I think she was just being coy.

31:25.688 --> 31:27.521
[Switch clicks] It's a girl?

31:27.523 --> 31:30.908
Oh, my God. Zoila, I'm so sorry.
You didn't wanna know the sex.

31:30.910 --> 31:33.443
It's okay.

31:35.531 --> 31:38.448
[Voice breaking]
Valentina's getting a sister.

31:38.450 --> 31:42.586
Zoila. [Chuckles]
What's wrong? The baby's okay.

31:42.588 --> 31:46.957
[Sniffles] You were right.

31:47.783 --> 31:52.629
I wasn't sure
I wanted this baby.

31:52.631 --> 31:54.965
[Sniffles]

31:54.967 --> 31:57.134
There were times I thought
everything would be easier

31:57.136 --> 32:00.637
if it would just go away.

32:00.639 --> 32:02.105
[Inhales deeply]

32:02.107 --> 32:04.341
But when I thought
I might lose it...

32:04.343 --> 32:07.060
Her.

32:08.263 --> 32:12.146
When I thought something was
gonna happen to her today...

32:13.485 --> 32:15.285
I realized...

32:15.287 --> 32:18.455
You love her.

32:18.457 --> 32:22.492
[Cries]

32:22.494 --> 32:24.745
Here you go.

32:24.747 --> 32:28.248
[Chuckles]
Oh, my God! She's perfect.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.968
All right, no more surfing down
the stairs, please?

32:30.970 --> 32:33.253
And you'll need to stay off that
ankle for a couple of weeks.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.005
Do you have anybody
who can take care of you?

32:35.007 --> 32:37.474
- She sure does.
- No!

32:37.476 --> 32:38.842
Don't worry, sis. Don't worry.

32:38.844 --> 32:40.644
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

32:44.650 --> 32:49.186
All this time, you were
engaging in sadomasochism

32:49.188 --> 32:52.189
with <i> my</i> husband in <i> my</i> house,

32:52.191 --> 32:54.691
right under my nose?

32:54.693 --> 32:57.861
I am really, really sorry.

32:57.863 --> 33:01.865
Carmen realizes it was a mistake
to ever agree to it.

33:01.867 --> 33:05.502
But ultimately,
Adrian threatened her job,

33:05.504 --> 33:08.119
and she couldn't say no.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.035
Well, I appreciate your candor.

33:11.036 --> 33:14.250
And I will deal with
Adrian accordingly.

33:15.149 --> 33:18.799
- As for you, Carmen...
- Yes?

33:18.801 --> 33:21.718
You're fired.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.855
You see? I don't know why
I listen to you.

33:24.857 --> 33:28.725
- Never tell the truth.
- Just a minute.

33:28.727 --> 33:30.560
Carmen is an employee
in your house,

33:30.562 --> 33:34.564
and Adrian created a hostile
work environment for her.

33:34.566 --> 33:38.035
You do not know the meaning
of the word "hostile."

33:38.037 --> 33:41.238
Evelyn, if you fire her now,
it will seem like

33:41.240 --> 33:44.491
you're retaliating against her
for complaining,

33:44.493 --> 33:46.660
and that's wrongful termination.

33:46.662 --> 33:49.913
- Beg pardon?
- That's right, lady. We know the law.

33:49.915 --> 33:52.249
With your deep pockets,

33:52.251 --> 33:54.217
the damages from a lawsuit
would cost...

33:54.219 --> 33:55.919
[Inhales sharply] millions.

33:55.921 --> 33:57.671
Wait. What?

33:57.673 --> 34:01.143
And the case could
drag on for years.

34:01.178 --> 34:03.784
Don't you want
to avoid all that?

34:03.785 --> 34:06.361
Go back to the money.
I could get millions from her?

34:06.379 --> 34:11.181
Oh, dear, I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

34:11.184 --> 34:13.685
I would never fire Carmen.

34:13.687 --> 34:15.853
Yes, you would.
You just did! Fire me!

34:15.856 --> 34:18.690
Oh, don't be absurd.
You're a wonderful housekeeper.

34:18.692 --> 34:20.024
That's a lie!

34:20.025 --> 34:22.694
Stop selling yourself short.

34:22.696 --> 34:24.562
You are...

34:24.563 --> 34:26.114
one of a kind.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.699
Now get back to work.

34:28.702 --> 34:31.585
These floor aren't
gonna clean themselves.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.341
[Voice breaking] <i>Dignos de</i>
<i>las promesas de Cristo.</i>

34:36.342 --> 34:40.679
[Sniffles] Amen.

34:40.681 --> 34:43.797
Sorry. I didn't wanna interrupt.
Rosie, what's wrong?

34:48.021 --> 34:50.522
I'm afraid God is
angry with me,

34:50.524 --> 34:53.641
and that's why we were
struck by lightning.

34:53.643 --> 34:55.773
I don't understand.

34:55.829 --> 34:59.367
The church says
I'm still married to Ernesto.

35:01.818 --> 35:05.486
So that's why you've been
so distant lately?

35:05.488 --> 35:07.405
I think being with you
is a sin.

35:07.407 --> 35:11.576
Look, Rosie, that lightning...
it was just a coincidence.

35:11.578 --> 35:14.662
[Sniffles] It's not just God.

35:14.664 --> 35:16.080
[Sniffles]

35:16.082 --> 35:19.918
Spence...

35:19.920 --> 35:23.504
the last thing I want to do
is hurt you,

35:23.506 --> 35:26.474
but...

35:26.476 --> 35:28.927
I am having feelings
for Ernesto.

35:28.929 --> 35:32.146
Ever since he came back...
[Sniffles]

35:32.148 --> 35:34.315
I've been trying to fight it.

35:34.317 --> 35:37.769
But I can't deny it anymore.

35:37.771 --> 35:39.270
I see.

35:39.272 --> 35:43.274
I am <i> so</i> sorry.

35:43.276 --> 35:46.694
- You still love him?
- I never stopped,

35:46.696 --> 35:48.863
even when I thought
he was dead. [Sniffles]

35:48.865 --> 35:50.271
So...

35:53.996 --> 35:58.165
- Are you going back to him?
- I don't know yet.

35:58.167 --> 36:00.634
But it's not fair to you

36:00.636 --> 36:03.587
to have a wife who also loves
someone else.

36:03.589 --> 36:07.007
Rosie, don't do this.
I love you.

36:07.009 --> 36:10.310
I love you, too, so much.

36:12.481 --> 36:15.315
But I don't know what else
to do.

36:15.317 --> 36:20.020
[Sniffles]

36:20.022 --> 36:21.955
[Crying]

36:27.084 --> 36:31.253
Hey, Jesse. Can we talk?

36:31.255 --> 36:32.754
Is this about the other night?

36:32.756 --> 36:35.423
Yes.
I owe you an apology.

36:35.530 --> 36:39.665
I made... an advance on you.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.167
Are you serious?

36:41.169 --> 36:42.869
I thought we were having
a moment,

36:42.871 --> 36:44.670
and I got carried away.

36:44.672 --> 36:48.007
I hope you will accept
my apology, and we can move on.

36:48.009 --> 36:50.343
No. I don't accept.

36:50.345 --> 36:53.179
I'm trying to make
things right here, Jesse.

36:53.181 --> 36:55.014
[Sighs]

36:55.016 --> 36:58.351
If anything, I was afraid
of taking advantage of you.

36:58.353 --> 36:59.719
Of me?

36:59.721 --> 37:01.721
You had had a few too many,
and I just...

37:01.723 --> 37:03.723
I wanted our first...

37:03.725 --> 37:06.192
whatever... to be sober.

37:09.230 --> 37:11.564
I was trying to be a gentleman.

37:11.566 --> 37:13.032
[Exhales]

37:13.034 --> 37:17.282
So...
that's why you left?

37:18.156 --> 37:20.740
- Not because I...
- Kissed me?

37:20.742 --> 37:22.909
[Whispers] No.

37:22.911 --> 37:24.794
I've been wanting
to kiss you

37:25.041 --> 37:28.570
since the first
time I met you.

37:35.757 --> 37:37.089
[Grunts] [Objects clatter]

37:37.091 --> 37:39.091
S-sorry. Let me just...

37:39.093 --> 37:40.593
No, it's okay.

37:40.595 --> 37:42.061
My maid will clean it up
in the morning.

37:42.063 --> 37:43.813
[Exhales] [Giggles]

37:49.938 --> 37:54.240
So you told Evelyn <i> everything,</i>
and she didn't fire you?

37:54.242 --> 37:56.075
Well, I didn't mention <i> you.</i>

37:56.077 --> 37:58.077
But, yeah, I still have a job.

37:58.079 --> 38:01.113
And I don't have to hurt
Mr. Powell anymore.

38:01.115 --> 38:02.365
Can <i> I</i> hurt him?

38:02.367 --> 38:05.117
No! It's over. I mean it.

38:05.119 --> 38:07.420
Okay.

38:07.422 --> 38:09.038
Listen...

38:09.040 --> 38:10.456
I wanted to thank you

38:10.458 --> 38:12.291
for all your help
the other day.

38:12.293 --> 38:15.261
Well, if you told Evelyn anyway,
I guess it didn't really matter.

38:15.263 --> 38:16.929
No, it <i> did</i> matter, to <i> me.</i>

38:16.931 --> 38:19.765
You were there
when I really needed you,

38:19.767 --> 38:21.267
and that means a lot.

38:21.269 --> 38:23.302
I'm always gonna be there
for you,<i> mon coeur.</i>

38:23.304 --> 38:25.638
Not <i> always.</i>
What does that mean?

38:25.640 --> 38:28.274
I'm just being realistic,
Sebastien.

38:28.276 --> 38:31.360
I know you care about me,
but you're married.

38:35.116 --> 38:36.482
I was thinking.

38:36.484 --> 38:37.817
Maybe I...

38:37.819 --> 38:40.903
don't have to be married
anymore.

38:40.905 --> 38:44.156
But what about your prenup?

38:44.158 --> 38:45.791
I thought you couldn't leave
your wife.

38:45.793 --> 38:47.493
Don't worry.

38:47.495 --> 38:49.095
I have a plan.

38:52.333 --> 38:53.966
[Telephone ringing in distance]

38:53.968 --> 38:56.836
I forgot how delicious
applesauce is. Mmm!

38:56.838 --> 38:58.337
Please put down your baby food.

38:58.339 --> 39:01.507
I'd like to speak with you.

39:01.509 --> 39:03.009
[Door closes]

39:03.011 --> 39:04.510
[Clears throat]

39:04.512 --> 39:07.680
[Sighs deeply]
I know about you and Carmen.

39:07.682 --> 39:09.265
She told me everything.

39:09.267 --> 39:10.816
And you're angry.

39:10.818 --> 39:14.553
No. I'm resolved.

39:14.555 --> 39:18.107
I have had an epiphany.

39:18.109 --> 39:19.358
Oh?

39:19.360 --> 39:22.028
You've always done

39:22.030 --> 39:23.946
whatever you wanted to do,

39:23.948 --> 39:26.832
and I have always
turned a blind eye.

39:26.834 --> 39:30.036
Yes, and that's always
worked out splendidly.

39:30.038 --> 39:31.537
For you, maybe.

39:34.375 --> 39:37.677
This health scare wasn't
just a warning for you.

39:37.679 --> 39:40.630
It was a warning for me, too.

39:40.632 --> 39:42.682
You're gonna die one day.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.183
Do you really have to be
so morbid?

39:44.185 --> 39:45.635
I can't control you.

39:45.637 --> 39:46.969
You can't even
control yourself!

39:46.971 --> 39:48.888
You're ruled by
your nether regions.

39:48.890 --> 39:53.526
And one day, perhaps... soon,

39:53.528 --> 39:56.862
your perversions will kill you,
and I will be alone.

39:56.864 --> 39:58.648
- Well, I refuse to be alone.
- Evelyn...

39:58.650 --> 39:59.899
I'm not finished.

40:03.154 --> 40:05.321
From now on,

40:05.323 --> 40:08.491
you can get your jollies
however you please.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.576
But first,

40:10.578 --> 40:13.162
you have to give me something
I want.

40:13.164 --> 40:15.247
And what's that?

40:15.249 --> 40:17.438
I want a child.

40:22.826 --> 40:24.955
Honey I'm sorry that
I yelled you that other night.

40:26.456 --> 40:28.518
I know you didn't mean
to hurt mommy.

40:30.251 --> 40:31.637
Can you forgive me?

40:32.348 --> 40:35.116
It's okay.
I'm sorry too.

40:35.816 --> 40:37.258
I know you are.

40:38.187 --> 40:40.183
But you have to
promise me something.

40:40.636 --> 40:41.805
What?

40:42.671 --> 40:44.356
You can't run away anymore.

40:45.104 --> 40:48.850
There are people looking for you.
Bad people.

40:48.888 --> 40:50.568
I know.

40:50.603 --> 40:51.921
That's why you need
to stay with us,

40:51.956 --> 40:53.641
so mommy and I
can keep you safe.

40:56.659 --> 40:58.199
Do you understand me Katy?

40:59.088 --> 41:01.286
Do you have to call
me Katy forever?

41:03.744 --> 41:04.994
Yes, sweetheart.

41:05.221 --> 41:07.576
That's you name now.

41:07.577 --> 41:08.977
[Doorbell rings]

41:09.414 --> 41:10.826
I'll be right back.

41:15.450 --> 41:16.857
[Door opens]

41:17.890 --> 41:22.470
Hi. I'm friends with Marisol.
She send me over.

41:23.496 --> 41:26.234
- She did?
- My name's Rosie.

41:26.269 --> 41:28.349
I'm your new maid.

41:29.269 --> 41:31.214
Come in.
