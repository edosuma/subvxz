[phone ringing]

01:46.981 --> 01:47.899
[in Spanish] Yes?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.652
[Rubén] They're coming for Zacatecas.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.989
[pounding on door]

01:55.365 --> 01:58.743
[Chapo in Spanish] Rafa! Rafa, wake up!

01:59.202 --> 02:00.286
-Rafa!

02:25.562 --> 02:27.981
[Rafa in Spanish]
Where are you going, you sons of bitches?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.482
Come on, motherfuckers!

02:29.816 --> 02:31.776
This field feeds all of us!

02:32.777 --> 02:33.903
Let's go, fuckers!

02:34.195 --> 02:36.322
Fight or I'll kill you right here!

02:36.823 --> 02:38.408
-Come on!
-Let's go!

02:39.826 --> 02:42.871
Now! Let's go! Let's go!

02:56.801 --> 02:58.094
Let's go!

02:58.178 --> 03:00.054
[indistinct yelling]

Come on, brother. Let's go!

[soldier moaning]

06:01.527 --> 06:02.862
[gunshot]

06:02.945 --> 06:04.030
[Chapo] Get out of here!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.677
Check over there.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.806
-Hey! Hey!
-Hey. Don't shoot.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.349
Come out.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.395
-Quickly! Quickly!
-Yes, sir.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.908
[in English] Jesus fucking Christ.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.122
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

08:33.221 --> 08:34.472
-Ed.
-Jaime.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.058
[in English] Ambassador.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.184
-How are you?
-Thanks for coming.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.688
Would you look at that?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.275
Never seen that much marijuana
in one place.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.111
[ambassador] I imagine there's never been
that much in one place.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.322
[Kiki] Yeah,
state of the art irrigation systems,

08:51.405 --> 08:53.449
got barracks for 7,000 workers,

08:53.699 --> 08:54.867
a mess hall,

08:55.660 --> 08:57.870
warehouses for processing and storage...

08:59.080 --> 09:01.082
all in the middle of the fucking desert.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.835
How does that happen?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.882
I think you know how it happened, sir.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.894
[narrator in English] There were stories
of people hundreds of miles away

10:03.978 --> 10:06.814
feeling a little funny that afternoon.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.609
But not Rafael Caro Quintero.

10:10.234 --> 10:16.449
In 1984, total US marijuana consumption
was estimated at 15,000 metric tons.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.076
His field held one third of it.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.746
Five thousand motherfucking tons.

10:21.829 --> 10:26.125
Caro Quintero had built the greatest weed
farm in the history of modern agriculture.

10:26.208 --> 10:31.380
Perfectly engineered to maximize profit,
he even timed the harvest for March. Why?

10:32.089 --> 10:35.384
Every narcos' favorite holiday:
spring break.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.012
And in the end, they got it all.

10:38.095 --> 10:42.642
The largest seizure in history.
Street value: two and a half billion.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.395
I mean, there were oil fields
in Saudi Arabia worth less.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.149
Time Magazine called it
"the Bust of the Century."

10:50.232 --> 10:53.653
You like that? DEA sure as hell did.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.572
Four years of having
their asses handed to them.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.659
They handed it all back. With interest.

10:59.742 --> 11:03.537
And for the first time,
the Thin Man was vulnerable.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.414
[in Spanish] Not even a call?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.458
They raid my field
and not a fucking word from you?

11:07.541 --> 11:11.003
The gringos back-channeled it,
used the military, no cops.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.296
[Félix sighs]

11:14.382 --> 11:16.550
This is fucked. Fucked, Azul.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.677
[elevator dings]

11:19.303 --> 11:22.264
It was inconvenient timing
with Nava disappearing.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.018
Yeah. And you got a fucking promotion.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.771
I just don't want
this kind of fuck-up happening again.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.191
Not on my end.
But you got fancier friends than me.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.610
-Maybe they should warn you sooner--
-No! Wait.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.905
You're here just to do your job, Azul.
That's it!

11:38.906 --> 11:39.824
Are we clear?

11:42.952 --> 11:43.828
[Félix] How's it going?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.330
Good morning, everyone.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.500
Thanks for being here.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.587
What's up, Neto? How you holding up?

11:54.171 --> 11:57.007
Hanging in there. One day at a time.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.055
Fucking Americans.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.099
Slipped one through.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.106
Motherfucker.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.482
You look worse than me.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.739
You want a drink?

12:20.781 --> 12:24.034
What I want is to kill
all those motherfuckers.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.288
Yeah.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.583
They hit us hard.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.627
No way around that.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.881
El Azul says it won't happen again, right?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.633
We don't have to act like we're stupid.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.886
We know this is how things go
in this business.

12:42.636 --> 12:46.891
But even with all this, it doesn't matter.
We've doubled our profits.

12:46.974 --> 12:50.603
And once our new distribution system's up,
we could see five times that.

12:52.146 --> 12:55.232
But it's very important
right now more than ever

12:55.316 --> 12:57.359
to be alert and quiet.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.320
Discreet.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.531
We can't afford
anymore unwanted attention, is that clear?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.574
[Amado] Yes.

13:19.882 --> 13:20.883
[Félix] Rafa!

13:21.383 --> 13:22.343
Rafa!

13:22.843 --> 13:23.928
What's wrong?

13:26.263 --> 13:27.598
What's wrong, man?

13:29.767 --> 13:31.227
You want to know what's wrong?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.232
You handle Amado by giving him
a promotion in Juárez.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.694
They burn my field
and it's the cost of doing business.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.072
-That's what's wrong.
-Look, Rafa--

13:43.155 --> 13:45.616
No more bullshit, Félix.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.035
I get it, man.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.956
Our farms are in Colombia now, I get it.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.918
We're done with weed. No problem.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.921
No problem?

14:01.048 --> 14:03.175
I know about what you did
in the restaurant.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.346
-They were after me.
-They were tourists, Rafael!

14:10.099 --> 14:13.811
-We cleaned it up.
-Are you stupid or what?

14:15.229 --> 14:17.523
Don't you realize
how fucking stupid that was?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.316
I can't count on you like this.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.569
I wasn't even going to invite you
to this meeting.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.826
I don't recognize this thing anymore.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.077
Yes.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.874
-Everything we built went to shit.
-No, no, no.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.625
You're the one going to shit.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.878
And I need you
to get your head on straight.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.214
Got it?

14:46.802 --> 14:47.845
[elevator dings]

14:56.770 --> 14:59.315
Our friend is having a rough time, huh?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.192
Can we talk?

15:04.403 --> 15:08.574
[Amado] Acosta's going to be pissed
about all the money he lost on that raid.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.075
And he was on the fence to begin with.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.288
Talk to him like your uncle.
He's old school.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.707
Brother...

15:17.333 --> 15:21.086
my uncle never killed a man and dragged
him through town behind a pickup.

15:21.170 --> 15:25.007
Listen, Amado,
I need Juárez to ramp up distribution.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.301
Do you want to be a boss or not?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.803
Then go up there
and talk to that motherfucker.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.182
Okay! But what do I tell him
about the raid? That's what I don't know!

15:36.435 --> 15:38.437
Do I have to tell you
how to do everything?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.482
Just fucking fix it!

15:43.525 --> 15:44.485
All right, then.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.165
[Kiki in English] Gotta think we finally
got under that motherfucker's skin, huh?

15:58.248 --> 16:00.501
[Sears] Two-point-five billion doesn't,
nothing will.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.086
So Minneapolis, huh?

16:03.545 --> 16:05.965
You're gonna stick out
like a sore thumb over there, buddy.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.343
-Too much brown in me now.
-[Kiki] Yeah, I know. [laughs]

16:09.426 --> 16:12.763
-Right there, right there.
-Oh, yeah, no. Those freckles are huge!

16:14.014 --> 16:15.099
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.059
-Are they ready?
-Yeah.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.439
[Jaime]
How are those burgers looking, boys?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.818
[Kiki] Why are you smiling like that?

16:26.485 --> 16:31.198
[clears throat] That, gentlemen,
was Ed Heath on the phone.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.741
Turns out...

16:34.451 --> 16:36.870
we won some hearts and minds in DC.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.080
Uh-huh.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.625
The House Foreign Affairs Committee
is sending down two investigators tomorrow

16:41.709 --> 16:43.002
to talk to us,

16:43.085 --> 16:44.962
open up all our files on the whole cartel.

16:45.045 --> 16:45.879
[Kiki] Oh!

16:45.963 --> 16:47.881
-Holy shit!
-Oh!

16:47.965 --> 16:50.467
That's what I'm fucking talking about!
Yeah, motherfucker!

16:50.551 --> 16:52.177
All right. All right.
Let's not get too excited, okay?

16:52.261 --> 16:55.639
Oh, no! As much shit as we've eaten
on this thing? Come on!

16:55.723 --> 16:59.727
[sighs] To the biggest take
in the history of the DEA.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.895
[chuckles]
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.189
[Sears] And smoke it. And smoke it.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.443
[whimsical guitar music playing]

17:07.526 --> 17:09.611
[Cuco sniffling]

17:17.703 --> 17:19.621
[Cuco snorting]

17:30.591 --> 17:31.592
Ah.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.099
[snorts]

17:50.152 --> 17:54.323
[Cuco snorts]

18:00.037 --> 18:01.538
[in Spanish] Hey, man, help yourself.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.426
What the fuck, man!

18:14.510 --> 18:16.386
I'm done with that shit, Cuco.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.598
That shit took Sofia.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.476
That shit took my field.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.438
-It's over, man.
-[Cuco] We can't quit just like that.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.982
A friend of mine gave it up
and almost went crazy.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.735
I have to get the devil out of me.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.305
[Tony in Spanish]
He's been waiting, Mr. Félix.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.576
We need to talk.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.663
My uncle and his associates are concerned.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.249
This raid at Zacatecas...

19:28.333 --> 19:30.002
got a lot of attention.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.712
Hold on.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.007
You warn us half an hour before the raid

19:35.090 --> 19:37.384
and now you're going to tell me
you're concerned?

19:38.677 --> 19:41.138
Didn't you say marijuana
didn't matter to them?

19:42.097 --> 19:44.349
We just didn't anticipate that reaction.

19:45.267 --> 19:49.396
And you, my friend, shouldn't have built
a field you can see from the fucking moon.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.731
[scoffs]

19:50.814 --> 19:54.193
All it took was some piece of shit pilot
and a DEA agent

19:54.276 --> 19:58.530
to snap a couple of pictures
and cause a shit storm in Mexico City.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.659
The Attorney General's asking questions.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.704
He already spoke to your uncle?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.122
[Rubén] Not yet.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.583
They're old friends, of course.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.919
The old man's honest.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.296
And my uncle is very careful.

20:15.130 --> 20:20.219
And let me tell you, friend...
the gringos had a wire.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.139
They were listening
to your entire operation.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.727
We took care of that, don't you worry.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.814
And how can we know what they've heard?

20:32.898 --> 20:33.732
Listen...

20:35.859 --> 20:39.988
if they had something else,
we would know by now, don't you think?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.952
I just hope there's nothing
involving my uncle.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.789
If it comes to light
that you're in business together--

20:48.872 --> 20:50.332
I know. Of course.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.878
Although, you know well...

20:56.129 --> 21:01.301
there's only one way to be sure
what this fucking agent knows.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.970
You understand?

21:04.179 --> 21:05.180
No.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.350
Let's see if you understand me.

21:08.850 --> 21:13.063
That shit you're thinking about?
It's not going to happen. Okay?

21:14.147 --> 21:14.982
[Rubén] Félix.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.819
You people are
constantly grabbing people off the street.

21:18.902 --> 21:21.989
Yes, but not a fucking DEA agent.
We aren't stupid.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.408
That's like shooting yourself
in the foot, man!

21:25.325 --> 21:28.412
And then they'll come back
ten times harder.

21:29.288 --> 21:33.542
And then tell your uncle to hide,
because it'll shine a light on everything.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.754
So you won't do it?

21:38.213 --> 21:39.172
Listen...

21:39.589 --> 21:41.675
you shouldn't even be asking me.

[man] And what happened
to El Azul's predecessor...

41:34.492 --> 41:36.494
that was good for business?

41:38.078 --> 41:40.080
Management turnover.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.124
That's all.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.753
The fucking DEA has nothing else.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.091
They're already transferring
these agents out of Mexico.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.596
We have to let this thing die down.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.765
Quietly.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.778
We won't touch the American.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.658
[sighs]

42:25.292 --> 42:27.378
[Acosta in Spanish]
So where's my fucking truck?

42:27.753 --> 42:30.047
[Paco] It's on the other side
of that ridge, Don Pablo.

42:30.714 --> 42:31.882
[Acosta] Yes.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.093
So's the US border, Paco.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.679
[Paco] You know I'm not a snitch.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.764
I'd never do that to you.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.939
And if it's a setup
and the Americans are waiting for us?

42:48.774 --> 42:50.568
Or our watermelon truck.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.070
[Acosta grunts]

42:54.405 --> 42:55.781
[Acosta sighs]

42:56.907 --> 42:58.784
I've seen how it ends for me.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.912
I die in a big shoot-out.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.707
Men with badges, heavy guns.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.003
If this is it...

43:10.296 --> 43:11.547
fuck it.

43:35.237 --> 43:37.323
Come on. Let's go down.

43:45.831 --> 43:46.832
[cocks gun]

43:55.007 --> 43:56.800
Don't think about it, get out.

43:58.677 --> 43:59.678
[exhales]

44:09.229 --> 44:10.230
[cocks gun]

44:33.128 --> 44:34.046
[grunts]

44:37.007 --> 44:37.841
[Amado] Hey!

44:38.926 --> 44:41.261
Are we going to get
our fucking coke or what?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.181
[Acosta] Pull from there.

44:45.265 --> 44:46.517
[grunting]

44:53.232 --> 44:55.693
[Acosta] There it is. Pull!

44:59.363 --> 45:01.949
[Acosta laughs]

45:02.032 --> 45:03.033
Look.

45:04.159 --> 45:06.453
Look, Dopey. [laughs]

45:06.537 --> 45:08.330
We found Snow White.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.707
[laughs]

45:14.253 --> 45:16.922
[Kiki in English] So I read
the brochure on the Catholic school.

45:17.297 --> 45:20.008
And what's wrong with public school?

45:20.592 --> 45:24.096
I'm just worried it might be a step down
from the American school here.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.933
So now that we live in a big house
and Kikito goes to private school,

45:28.016 --> 45:29.560
we're all fancy now?

45:29.643 --> 45:32.354
Yeah, we're the Mexican Jeffersons now.

45:34.189 --> 45:36.066
Los Jeffersons.

45:36.650 --> 45:38.193
-Sí.
-Ha.

45:39.319 --> 45:40.571
How'd it go today?

45:41.530 --> 45:43.782
I thought you didn't care
and just wanted to go home.

45:43.866 --> 45:47.286
I didn't say that.
Plus, I know you can't wait to brag.

45:47.369 --> 45:49.663
-Oh.
-[Mika chuckles]

45:49.747 --> 45:51.540
Well, I wish you would've seen it.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.751
They were eating out of my hand.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.002
Both hands.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.963
When do you think you'll hear?

46:00.924 --> 46:02.634
Hopefully before we leave.

46:05.637 --> 46:08.390
Remember when you got word that
you weren't getting that job in Miami?

46:08.474 --> 46:09.892
I was so pissed.

46:09.975 --> 46:11.685
If I told you then
you could go to San Diego

46:11.769 --> 46:13.729
with a bump in grade and salary...

46:15.147 --> 46:16.148
I'd be happy.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.818
[in Spanish]
Can you heat one up for me, please?

46:26.116 --> 46:28.410
[in English] Whatever happens with this,
Kiki, you did enough.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.247
For us...

46:34.458 --> 46:35.584
you did enough.

46:43.300 --> 46:44.343
[laughs]

46:44.426 --> 46:45.677
[chuckles]

46:46.345 --> 46:49.181
-[in Spanish] Let's see.
-No, you can't with that one. Too big.

46:49.264 --> 46:50.390
It's too big.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.059
You do magic or not?

47:18.752 --> 47:20.045
How are you doing, Sammy?

47:20.420 --> 47:22.714
-You want to talk to him?
-No.

47:23.382 --> 47:24.466
To you.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.096
[man in Spanish]
It's modeled after the church in Culiacán.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.390
With all due respect, sir,

47:31.598 --> 47:34.810
I think it's going to be the most
beautiful mausoleum in Sinaloa.

47:37.729 --> 47:39.731
[Don Neto] I want him to be comfortable.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.900
[man] We can add air conditioning,

47:42.526 --> 47:45.946
a sound system to play his music,

47:46.697 --> 47:49.449
a fridge stocked
with his favorite beverages...

47:50.492 --> 47:52.578
It's the "King Tut" package.

47:52.995 --> 47:55.956
And you think his sports car will fit?

47:56.039 --> 47:58.917
Yes, of course.
If not, we can always adjust for it.

48:00.544 --> 48:01.753
Listen.

48:02.796 --> 48:05.507
[ranchera music playing]

48:10.387 --> 48:11.763
Don Neto, excuse me.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.558
I'll be driving you to dinner tonight.

48:14.975 --> 48:16.184
Whenever you like.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.395
Where's Sammy?

48:19.187 --> 48:20.606
Had to run an errand.

48:21.189 --> 48:23.317
Asshole, I didn't send him.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.944
No, it was for Azul.

48:27.404 --> 48:29.364
-Excuse me.
-Hold on.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.116
Where'd they go?

48:32.075 --> 48:34.453
-I don't know, boss.
-What do you mean you don't know?

48:34.912 --> 48:36.163
Let me find out.

48:37.831 --> 48:40.375
[knock on door]

48:57.809 --> 48:58.936
Rafa.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.104
Rafa!

49:03.565 --> 49:04.983
[in Spanish] They're looking for you.

49:09.279 --> 49:10.572
[groans]

49:29.299 --> 49:30.634
[El Azul] What's up, Rafa?

49:32.761 --> 49:34.179
What the fuck you want?

49:47.234 --> 49:48.193
Same thing as you.

50:04.584 --> 50:06.503
[Jaime in English] Years of junk, huh?

50:08.714 --> 50:09.923
Yeah, lots of it.

50:17.305 --> 50:22.436
Got a lunch receipt from 1983.
You think I can still get reimbursed?

50:23.437 --> 50:25.939
Hey, you know the Camelot opens at 11:00?

50:26.023 --> 50:26.940
Yep.

50:30.944 --> 50:32.946
[Kiki] So what did the investigator say?

50:33.655 --> 50:34.948
[Jaime] Hmm.

50:36.658 --> 50:39.578
Well, that's why I wanted to have drinks.

50:39.661 --> 50:40.662
[Kiki] Mm-hmm.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.622
[Jaime] Spoke with them this morning.

50:45.667 --> 50:48.003
"No further action at this time."

50:51.256 --> 50:52.507
-No action.
-Yeah.

50:52.591 --> 50:55.552
Committee didn't want to act
before the State Department so...

50:56.261 --> 50:57.679
they're not doing a thing.

51:01.016 --> 51:01.850
More bullshit.

51:08.523 --> 51:10.942
At this point, I can't really say
that I'm, uh...

51:11.234 --> 51:12.486
surprised...

51:14.071 --> 51:15.155
or disappointed.

51:19.534 --> 51:20.660
But you still are.

51:23.580 --> 51:24.498
Yeah.

51:26.792 --> 51:27.793
Me too.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.596
So what are you going to do now, Kiki?

51:42.307 --> 51:44.184
I'm going to have lunch with my lady.

51:58.573 --> 52:00.951
[speaking Spanish on TV]

52:09.167 --> 52:10.043
[sniffs]

52:10.127 --> 52:11.795
But I've got feelings.

52:11.878 --> 52:14.131
You planted a flower.

52:14.214 --> 52:18.176
-Very well.
-That flower gave you its petals...

52:25.058 --> 52:26.309
[knocks on door]

52:29.271 --> 52:31.690
What's up, Neto?
Let me see if Rafa is available.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.235
[phone ringing]

52:37.571 --> 52:38.530
[in Spanish] Hello?

52:38.613 --> 52:39.447
[Amado] Félix!

52:39.531 --> 52:41.324
-What's up?
-Hey!

52:41.408 --> 52:44.828
It turns out Pablo Acosta's
a fucking genius, bro.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.790
-Thought he was a crazy bloody asshole.
-[machines grating]

52:48.874 --> 52:52.919
That too, but we went to recover a load,

52:53.003 --> 52:56.339
and I saw how that motherfucker
hides the coke in the trucks.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.842
Gas tanks.

52:58.925 --> 53:01.553
We could learn something from this guy.

53:01.636 --> 53:03.555
[line ringing]

53:03.638 --> 53:04.598
[woman in Spanish] Good afternoon.

53:04.681 --> 53:07.142
-Don Neto here. Let me talk to the boss.
-He's busy.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.978
Interrupt him! It's very important.

53:10.061 --> 53:11.938
You have 30 seconds, woman.

53:12.022 --> 53:17.027
[Amado] We can bury them
in the runways to hide the coke.

53:17.569 --> 53:18.778
-Uh-huh.
-[woman] Sir...

53:20.363 --> 53:22.699
Hold one second, Amado. What's going on?

53:22.782 --> 53:24.743
Excuse me, Señor Neto's on the other line.

53:29.748 --> 53:31.666
We'll call him back in a minute.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.210
[woman] He says it's very important.

53:33.293 --> 53:35.754
This one is also important.
I'll call him back.

53:36.922 --> 53:38.089
Go on, Amado.

53:38.965 --> 53:40.717
[Cuco] What the fuck is happening, Rafa?

53:41.384 --> 53:42.385
Nothing.

53:42.969 --> 53:45.347
Fucking shit no one can stop.

53:47.933 --> 53:49.351
[in Spanish] Agent Camarena.

53:51.645 --> 53:52.646
Hi, Sammy.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.148
My commander wants to see you.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.361
[Kiki grunts]

54:00.320 --> 54:03.281
-[in Spanish] Hello. Table for two?
-Yes, follow me, please.

54:03.740 --> 54:05.450
[Kiki grunting]

54:16.670 --> 54:17.545
[zip tie zips]

54:18.046 --> 54:19.381
[tires squeal]

54:24.678 --> 54:26.054
[waitress] Here's the menu.

54:26.888 --> 54:28.306
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.612
[Kiki panting]

54:48.201 --> 54:51.621
All right, move ahead. Talk later.

54:52.163 --> 54:53.081
What is it, Neto?

54:53.540 --> 54:54.958
The kid fucked up.

54:55.041 --> 54:57.002
They're taking Camarena.

55:05.010 --> 55:06.303
Okay, I'm on my way.

55:09.097 --> 55:12.434
[grunting]

55:34.289 --> 55:36.624
[line ringing]

55:40.920 --> 55:42.172
[Suzy in English] DEA.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.799
-Hey, Suzy, it's Mika.
-Hi, Mika.

55:44.883 --> 55:46.217
Um, have you seen Kiki?

55:46.301 --> 55:48.636
No, I haven't seen him
for a few hours actually.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.055
Oh, um, he...

55:50.722 --> 55:52.307
he didn't show up for lunch.

55:52.390 --> 55:54.726
Well, he and Jaime stepped out
for a drink before.

55:57.562 --> 55:59.147
It's probably more than one.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.193
Do you want me to have him give you a call
when he gets in, sweetie?

56:03.276 --> 56:06.237
No, that's okay. Thanks, Suzy.

56:07.113 --> 56:08.406
-Bye.
-Bye.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.243
[tires squeal]

56:33.098 --> 56:34.724
[in Spanish] You agreed to this?

56:35.016 --> 56:37.102
That son of a bitch has to pay
for what he did.

56:37.185 --> 56:39.020
Come here. Come here!

56:42.857 --> 56:44.984
Forget about your goddamn field, Rafa.

56:48.154 --> 56:49.614
You know why they asked you?

56:50.281 --> 56:52.450
Because if something goes wrong,
they will blame you.

56:52.534 --> 56:56.371
Bullshit. They asked me because you did
nothing about the fuckers in the DEA.

56:56.746 --> 56:58.248
Look at me, asshole.

56:58.581 --> 56:59.666
Look at me!

57:00.041 --> 57:01.584
Is that what El Azul told you?

57:03.169 --> 57:04.754
They're using you, Rafa.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.550
You think I'm too dumb
to think for myself?

57:11.511 --> 57:13.680
This is my business
as much as yours, Félix.

57:13.763 --> 57:15.265
So fuck you.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.935
I made the call and there's nothing
you can do about it.

57:19.894 --> 57:20.728
Okay.

57:21.855 --> 57:22.856
Azul!

57:23.857 --> 57:25.608
We're going to take the agent back.

57:26.943 --> 57:29.028
Take him back where you found him.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.530
And leave him alone.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.323
Am I clear?

57:35.702 --> 57:37.620
That's not your call, Félix.

57:39.956 --> 57:42.375
[Félix] I thought you
weren't going to touch the American.

57:43.585 --> 57:45.837
-I changed my mind.
-Oh, really?

57:46.254 --> 57:47.589
Without consulting me?

57:49.632 --> 57:52.010
You seem to think we're partners.

57:52.343 --> 57:56.264
I think I make you a lot of money.

57:57.974 --> 58:00.685
And now your ignorance
is jeopardizing that.

58:01.102 --> 58:04.481
Listen carefully, Félix.
You seem to have trouble doing that.

58:06.024 --> 58:08.818
Two days ago, the DEA agent

58:09.569 --> 58:13.448
spoke to two members of an investigation
team from the United States Congress.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.035
Do you know what they talked about?

58:20.914 --> 58:24.083
Do you have any idea
what the Americans might be doing?

58:25.210 --> 58:26.336
I didn't think so.

58:27.837 --> 58:30.965
We have to find out exactly what he knows.

58:32.383 --> 58:34.928
Of course, you're welcome to let him go.
But if you do,

58:35.011 --> 58:38.348
I'm not sure you can continue
having our support.

58:55.365 --> 58:56.407
Where is he?

59:03.623 --> 59:04.666
[Don Neto] Félix!

59:06.042 --> 59:07.794
We can find another desert.

59:08.461 --> 59:11.798
Plant Caro's weed again. Start over.

59:12.924 --> 59:14.592
Start over, Neto?

59:15.176 --> 59:17.512
-We're almost there.
-Almost where?

59:17.929 --> 59:19.013
Getting where?

59:19.472 --> 59:21.391
Handcuffed to these serpents?

59:22.016 --> 59:26.854
You're the smartest guy I know, Félix.
But this...

1:00:31.794 --> 1:00:32.879
Begin.
