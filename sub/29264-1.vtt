           -Busy day.
           -Thank you.

     [jolly classical music]

01:38.386 --> 01:39.886
 Made her favorite this morning.

01:39.888 --> 01:43.156
       That should put her
         in a good mood.

01:43.158 --> 01:45.125
           Don't bring
      the negativity, Lulu.

01:45.127 --> 01:47.127
         I'm optimistic,
      I'm a glass-half-full

01:47.129 --> 01:48.495
          kind of elf.

02:05.547 --> 02:07.280
      Morning, Miss Cassie.

02:11.186 --> 02:12.719
         Up and at 'em.

02:12.721 --> 02:14.154
         [Cassie groans]

    Early bird gets the worm.

02:21.563 --> 02:23.596
        [Cassie] Go away.

02:23.598 --> 02:25.365
        Sorry about this.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.567
         [Cassie groans]

02:38.914 --> 02:41.648
      What has your father
     said about using magic

02:41.650 --> 02:43.316
 to avoid your responsibilities?

02:46.588 --> 02:49.556
       Just let me sleep,
  it's summer, I've earned it.

02:49.558 --> 02:52.592
       No can do, the boss
    gave strict instructions.

02:52.594 --> 02:54.561
      There's an itinerary.

02:54.563 --> 02:56.663
  Early morning wake-up, check,

02:56.665 --> 02:58.565
       breakfast, on deck.

02:58.567 --> 03:01.901
       You have a meeting
 with Cupcake in the mail room.

03:01.903 --> 03:04.671
   The boss wants you to know
  every facet of the business,

03:04.673 --> 03:08.408
   bottom to top. He gets over
    a million letters a year.

03:08.410 --> 03:11.644
       -Did you know that?
          -Fascinating.

03:11.646 --> 03:14.747
         I can't tell if
   this is one of those times
      where you think it is

03:14.749 --> 03:17.784
     or you say fascinating
 and you don't really think so.

03:19.688 --> 03:22.522
   Okay, so, not fascinating.

03:22.524 --> 03:24.724
    Uh, after the mail room,
       you have a photo-op

03:24.726 --> 03:27.860
     with the Young Aspiring
  Toy Makers of the North Pole.

03:27.862 --> 03:30.396
          Do I have to?
    They're just such nerds.

03:30.398 --> 03:33.666
 I was a member of the YATMOTNP.

03:33.668 --> 03:36.936
            -Shocker.
    -That hurt my feelings.

03:36.938 --> 03:39.806
     Guess I'm not building
   that thick skin after all.

03:39.808 --> 03:41.941
        Probably going to
      cry about that later.

03:41.943 --> 03:43.543
       Shake it off, Pep.

03:43.545 --> 03:44.544
           Finally...

03:45.680 --> 03:47.347
            tonight's
    the Tooth Fairy Banquet,

03:47.349 --> 03:51.451
          so, big day,
   let's get cracking. [claps]

03:51.453 --> 03:52.852
           I hate you.

03:54.789 --> 03:56.522
   Can I get a smile, Cassie?

03:56.524 --> 03:58.258
         [camera snaps]

03:58.260 --> 04:01.027
  Okay, thank you, Miss Cassie
    has another appointment.

04:01.029 --> 04:03.596
             Cassie,
   can I have your autograph?

04:03.598 --> 04:04.897
           Come here.

04:10.672 --> 04:12.405
       All right, come on.

04:13.341 --> 04:15.808
         [festive music]

04:17.879 --> 04:18.911
           Here we go.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.962
      Video Game Department
needs to go into overtime again.

04:35.964 --> 04:37.797
No, the more we pay in overtime,

04:37.799 --> 04:40.466
     the less we have in our
   quarterly earnings, no go.

04:40.468 --> 04:42.402
         The union isn't
       going to like that.

04:42.404 --> 04:43.970
    [chuckles] So what's new?

04:43.972 --> 04:45.672
         Set up a lunch
       with the union rep.

04:45.674 --> 04:47.507
   -What's his name? Pickles?
         -Freckles, sir.

04:47.509 --> 04:49.342
 -Pickles is head of accounting.
        -Yeah, whatever.

04:49.344 --> 04:51.444
 Listen, elves need to make toys

04:51.446 --> 04:53.079
as much as toys need to be made.

04:53.081 --> 04:54.714
        Solid logic, sir.

04:54.716 --> 04:55.915
         [Elf] The Sugar
      and Spice Department

04:55.917 --> 04:56.949
    is having major problems

04:56.951 --> 04:58.484
      with the candy canes.

04:58.486 --> 05:03.056
    -That doesn't look right.
         -Good eye, sir,
 worldwide peppermint shortage.

05:03.992 --> 05:05.325
             Listen,
 I don't want any more excuses,

05:05.327 --> 05:07.026
   I want results, Cottontail.

05:07.028 --> 05:09.095
      -It's Gum Drop, sir.
            -[sighs]

05:09.097 --> 05:10.496
          On it, Chief.

05:11.866 --> 05:13.866
Right, we'll pick this up later.

05:13.868 --> 05:15.968
         You got it, SC.
 Let's get back to work, fellas.

05:19.541 --> 05:22.475
 You do know it's summer, right?
 I'm supposed to be on vacation.

05:22.477 --> 05:26.045
          Ah, vacation,
from your many responsibilities.

05:26.948 --> 05:29.015
     Well, you've inherited
  your mother's sense of humor,

05:29.017 --> 05:32.552
   but unfortunately, not your
    father's business savvy,

05:32.554 --> 05:35.121
   and both will be necessary
 when you take over the company.

05:35.123 --> 05:36.889
        What's the hurry?

05:36.891 --> 05:38.991
     Ooh, you have something
     you'd rather be doing?

05:38.993 --> 05:40.526
 I don't know, meet new people.

05:40.528 --> 05:43.429
 Look around, people everywhere.

05:43.431 --> 05:45.398
          Yeah, elves.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.967
 Elves are people too, kind of.

05:47.969 --> 05:51.904
      [sighs] No, Dad, Dad,
I want to travel, see the world.

05:51.906 --> 05:54.841
      You'll see the world
   plenty once you take over,

05:54.843 --> 05:58.678
        you'll see it all
   in one night, once a year.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.947
   Dad, I want to find myself.

06:00.949 --> 06:03.850
        Oh. Oh, hey, hey,
   well, let me help you out.

06:03.852 --> 06:06.719
     [gasps] There you are,
     you're Cassandra Claus,

06:06.721 --> 06:09.155
you're at the North Pole, you're
   in your father's workshop,

06:09.157 --> 06:10.757
         and it's where
       you're meant to be,

06:10.759 --> 06:12.558
        so, I'll see you
     tonight at the banquet.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.026
    For the Tooth Fairy, huh?

06:14.028 --> 06:15.895
           Oh, I know,
     she's a bit eccentric.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.663
    Eccentric? She's a loon.

06:17.665 --> 06:19.465
         She's an ally.

06:19.467 --> 06:20.900
      Look, all of this is
   going to be yours someday,

06:20.902 --> 06:22.902
        and you're going
        to bring such joy

06:22.904 --> 06:24.871
  to the children of the world.

06:24.873 --> 06:26.572
            Come on.

06:26.574 --> 06:28.508
        Nobody wants me.

06:28.510 --> 06:31.411
         They want you,
with the beard and the red suit.

06:31.413 --> 06:33.980
They don't want some Santa Girl.

06:34.883 --> 06:36.783
         People tend to
    lower their expectations

06:36.785 --> 06:38.084
           when you're
      handing out presents.

06:38.086 --> 06:39.485
      I'll see you tonight.

06:39.487 --> 06:40.887
         Don't be late.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.523

06:47.629 --> 06:50.430
          [soft music]

06:50.432 --> 06:52.198
Miss Cassie, you're not dressed.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.500
            You know,
   and people say you're slow.

06:54.502 --> 06:56.436
        You were supposed
    to be at the reception...

06:56.438 --> 06:58.104
      What people say that?

06:58.106 --> 06:59.906
        Just relax, okay?

06:59.908 --> 07:01.441
     I don't really do that.

07:02.677 --> 07:04.444
          You got this
      letter this morning.

07:05.146 --> 07:08.114
         I'll take this,
    and when I come back up,

07:08.116 --> 07:09.816
  you'll be dressed and ready.

07:09.818 --> 07:12.785
      Yeah, if you need to
    believe that, absolutely.

07:12.787 --> 07:14.887
       Oddly, that didn't
    make me feel better.

07:27.235 --> 07:28.801

          -[Pep yelps]

 Miss Cassie, are you all right?

07:33.641 --> 07:35.041
            It came.
   I can't open it, you do it.

07:35.043 --> 07:36.843
             -Okay.
        -No, I'll do it.

07:36.845 --> 07:37.910
        That's fine too.

07:37.912 --> 07:39.645
            No, you.

07:39.647 --> 07:42.582
   This is from a university,
       in the real world.

07:42.584 --> 07:44.050
    Why would a university...

07:44.986 --> 07:46.085
            Oh, wow.

07:47.222 --> 07:48.821
    Oh, oh, geez, okay, okay.

07:49.791 --> 07:52.091
      -"Dear Miss Claus--"
         -Are you crazy?

07:52.093 --> 07:54.794
     Don't read it out loud,
    just read it to yourself
        and then tell me.

07:56.931 --> 07:58.231
         [Cassie sighs]

07:58.233 --> 08:00.566
 I didn't get in. Of course not.

08:01.903 --> 08:04.136
            You did,
    Miss Cassie, you got in.

08:04.138 --> 08:05.671
           -I got in?
          -You got in.

08:05.673 --> 08:08.574
            I got in?
    Oh, I got in! [chuckles]

08:08.576 --> 08:10.710
        A real university
       in the real world!

08:10.712 --> 08:13.179
     [chuckles] A new place
        with new people,

08:13.181 --> 08:15.615
       I'm going to learn
     everything! [chuckles]

08:15.617 --> 08:16.983
         We're bonding!

08:20.021 --> 08:21.988
       Does your dad know?

08:21.990 --> 08:23.923
   Oh, he's going to kill me.

08:23.925 --> 08:26.726
        ["Here We Go" by
    Christopher Robert Welch]

08:53.087 --> 08:54.954
  There he is, there's the guy.

08:55.924 --> 08:57.924
        So glad you could
       make it, I'm Larry.

08:58.893 --> 09:01.127
Larry Tooth Fairy, and on behalf
      of my entire family,

09:01.129 --> 09:03.763
     I'd like to welcome you
   to the Kingdom of Dentalia.

09:03.765 --> 09:06.032
      So how was the trip?
        You reindeer in?

09:06.034 --> 09:08.834
      Great way to travel.
  Santa, can I call you Santa?

09:08.836 --> 09:11.103
              -No.
           -Mr. Claus,

09:11.105 --> 09:13.139
      you're a business man
       and I respect you,

09:13.141 --> 09:16.142
        so let's get down
  to brass fillings. Inflation,

09:16.144 --> 09:17.577
 teeth used to go for a quarter,

09:17.579 --> 09:19.345
   now kids want 10, 20 bucks,

09:19.347 --> 09:20.980
        I mean, what are
  we talking about, am I right?

09:20.982 --> 09:23.616
            No idea,
   what are we talking about?

09:23.618 --> 09:27.987
       I'm talking merger.
 See, you have the liquid cash,
   we have an army with wings.

09:27.989 --> 09:30.790
 We help with toy distribution,
    you help with tooth cash.

09:30.792 --> 09:32.992
        Bing, bang, boom,
  both holidays are locked in,

09:32.994 --> 09:34.727
 kids are happy, life moves on.

09:34.729 --> 09:36.762
My mother, the, uh, Tooth Fairy,

09:38.333 --> 09:41.000
     she's single and ready
      to mingle, with you.

             [chime]

09:43.004 --> 09:45.104
        And I know
    your wife passed away...

09:47.241 --> 09:49.141
   I only bring it up because
    of the Jack Frost merger.

09:49.143 --> 09:52.244
      Seems you're open to
   powerful families uniting.

09:52.246 --> 09:55.281
          We also have
  a powerful family, Mr. Claus.

09:55.283 --> 09:56.949
          I'm going to
     walk away from you now,

09:56.951 --> 09:58.351
          but it's only
    because I don't like you

09:58.353 --> 09:59.919
    or what you have to say.

10:01.823 --> 10:03.923
    So you'll think about it?

10:06.894 --> 10:08.694
 These tooth fairies are insane,

10:08.696 --> 10:10.630
    every single one of them,
        the whole family.

10:10.632 --> 10:12.865
     Uh-oh, what did you do?

10:14.202 --> 10:15.301
   What are you talking about?

10:15.303 --> 10:17.269
     I'm just standing here.

10:17.271 --> 10:19.672
   You're giving me the look.

10:19.674 --> 10:20.873
        I know the look.

10:22.043 --> 10:24.977
 Okay, so I applied to college,

10:25.913 --> 10:28.147
          and I got in.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.282
         Yay. [chuckles]

10:30.284 --> 10:32.418
  Education is super important.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.120
    You say that, right?

10:34.122 --> 10:35.921
 Your mother said that, not me.

10:35.923 --> 10:37.356
       I don't understand,

10:37.358 --> 10:39.992
       why would you want
    to leave the North Pole?

10:39.994 --> 10:41.927
          First of all,

   we have a plan, Cassandra.
        -I hate the plan.

 No, you are going to apprentice
     in the family business,

10:58.913 --> 11:01.313
    and then this Christmas,
         you're going to
      marry the Frost boy.

11:01.315 --> 11:04.350
      I don't want to marry
     someone I've never met.

11:04.352 --> 11:06.052

11:06.054 --> 11:07.987
 have a very delicate alliance,

11:07.989 --> 11:10.256

11:12.193 --> 11:14.727
              Yeah,
  and I haven't seen him since.

11:14.729 --> 11:16.796
         Well, for your
    information, young lady,

11:16.798 --> 11:18.964
   your mother and my marriage
          was arranged.

11:18.966 --> 11:21.033
  Her father was Kris Kringle,

11:21.035 --> 11:24.737

   reindeer farm in the world.

11:24.739 --> 11:27.907
        I know the story
      of you and Mom, Dad,

11:27.909 --> 11:30.276
      but I just want some
  independence, some adventure,

11:30.278 --> 11:32.812
      before I settle into
 the life that you chose for me.

11:33.715 --> 11:35.314
        Is that so crazy?

11:46.260 --> 11:48.027

  -children are counting on us.
            -I know.

12:11.953 --> 12:13.819
 And this merger with Jack Frost

12:13.821 --> 12:16.489
   will ensure that Christmas
    will go on and on and on,

12:16.491 --> 12:19.425
 and to that end, you will marry
 the heir to the Frost Kingdom,

12:19.427 --> 12:21.093
       is that understood?

12:21.095 --> 12:22.094

   a semester studying abroad

         -Daddy, really?

12:30.805 --> 12:32.838
         So long as you
    come back this Christmas,

12:32.840 --> 12:35.141
    you marry the Frost boy,
 and you take over the business.

12:35.143 --> 12:37.109
      There's no complains,
    there's no belly-aching,

12:37.111 --> 12:38.511

19:46.407 --> 19:48.874
          I don't want
Christmas decorations in August,

19:48.876 --> 19:50.842
    I don't want weird hats,
        or pointy shoes,

19:50.844 --> 19:53.412
      or you propped up on
    a shelf causing mischief.

19:53.414 --> 19:55.981
   That's not really my thing,
  I'm too big for most shelves.

19:55.983 --> 19:57.916
       No weird elf stuff.

19:58.786 --> 20:01.687
      -Got it, Miss Cassie.
       -Just Cassie, okay?

20:01.689 --> 20:05.324
      You're not my servant
      anymore, you're, um,
      my little sister now.

20:05.326 --> 20:08.794
In elf years, I just turned 139,
       so technically I--

20:08.796 --> 20:11.396
 You're my little sister, okay?

20:11.398 --> 20:13.432
           You're just
      a regular human girl.

20:13.434 --> 20:15.667
       Copy that, Cassie.

20:15.669 --> 20:17.502
        Quick follow-up,

20:17.504 --> 20:20.272
 what do regular human girls do?

20:21.308 --> 20:22.507
      We'll figure it out.

20:22.509 --> 20:23.508
             -Okay.
             -Yeah.

20:23.510 --> 20:25.677
           Okay. Okay.

20:29.383 --> 20:30.549
          [Pep shrieks]

20:31.452 --> 20:33.252
      Sorry, I needed that.

20:34.355 --> 20:35.921
            Too elfy?

20:35.923 --> 20:37.522
     Ah, it's a little elfy.

20:39.526 --> 20:41.026
          [Pep] Look at
      all the real people.

20:41.028 --> 20:42.894
            No magic,
   just doing their own thing,

20:42.896 --> 20:44.730
    whatever they want to do.

20:44.732 --> 20:46.898
       It reminds me of my
 days at North Pole University.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.900
          I majored in
      reindeer psychology.

20:49.970 --> 20:51.503
    Reindeer are complicated.

20:51.505 --> 20:53.005
     Okay, just act normal,

20:53.007 --> 20:55.040
      I don't want to look
     silly on my first day.

20:55.876 --> 20:57.676
         [Cassie groans]

20:57.678 --> 20:59.845
    Miss Cassie? Cassie? Sis?

20:59.847 --> 21:01.446
         [Cassie groans]

21:01.448 --> 21:02.914
            You okay?

21:04.618 --> 21:06.485
          What hit me?

21:06.487 --> 21:08.387
       An errant Frisbee.

21:08.389 --> 21:11.390
         Sorry, my bad,
       the wind caught it.

21:11.392 --> 21:13.392
          -No problem.
             -What?

21:13.394 --> 21:15.060
           No problem!

21:15.062 --> 21:16.628
    Can I give you a hand?

21:17.598 --> 21:19.398
          Yeah, thanks.

21:22.036 --> 21:25.370
  Wow, you're the prettiest boy
         I've ever seen.

21:25.372 --> 21:26.705
          Well, thanks.

21:28.575 --> 21:32.311
            -I'm JR.
     -Oh, I'm Cassie Claus,
        and this is Pep.

21:32.313 --> 21:33.845
          -Her sister.
             -Claus?

21:33.847 --> 21:36.315
        Like, [chuckles]
        like Santa Claus?

21:36.317 --> 21:37.983
             -Nope.
       -Nuh-uh. [chuckles]

21:37.985 --> 21:40.319
            -No way!
    -[chuckles] That's crazy.

21:40.321 --> 21:42.788
    -[Pep] That's ridiculous!
             -Okay.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.723
          No relation.

21:44.725 --> 21:46.091
 You ready for classes to start?

21:46.093 --> 21:49.061
       -Ah, super excited!
         -[JR chuckles]

21:49.063 --> 21:50.729
     But not in a weird way,

21:50.731 --> 21:53.031
    in a totally normal way,
      like everybody else.

21:53.033 --> 21:54.900
Except I don't know how that is.

21:54.902 --> 21:57.536
        This is my first
      time away from home.

21:57.538 --> 21:59.805
  That's a lot of information.

21:59.807 --> 22:02.341
           I'm, like,
totally cool with it. [chuckles]

22:03.077 --> 22:04.943
         I'm heading to
       the bookstore now.

22:04.945 --> 22:07.546
 Oh, crazy coincidence, so am I.

22:08.782 --> 22:09.981
        May I escort you?

22:09.983 --> 22:11.950
 I like how he talks. [chuckles]

22:11.952 --> 22:13.518
              Yeah,
  that would be great, thanks.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.420
      The more the merrier.

22:15.422 --> 22:16.588
             Sweet.

22:16.590 --> 22:17.889
  What kind of soap do you use?

22:17.891 --> 22:19.991
    Because you smell pretty.

22:21.061 --> 22:23.895
  Uh, Pep, I'm a little chilly,
     and I forgot my jacket,

22:23.897 --> 22:25.697
        do you mind going
   back and getting it for me?

22:25.699 --> 22:27.399
        Sure thing, sis.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.569
    Wow, she's enthusiastic.

22:30.571 --> 22:32.838
  -And she's driving me crazy.
        -[both laughing]

22:32.840 --> 22:34.973
      Let's get out of here
     before she comes back.

22:34.975 --> 22:35.974
          Is that mean?

22:35.976 --> 22:37.376
      That's totally mean.

22:38.379 --> 22:40.379
           -Let's go.
       -[Cassie chuckles]

22:40.381 --> 22:41.813
         [upbeat music]

22:41.815 --> 22:43.648
I just moved back to the States,

22:43.650 --> 22:44.750
        did some boarding
     school in Switzerland.

22:44.752 --> 22:46.651
   Oh, wow, that's so exotic.

22:47.721 --> 22:50.522
            You know,
   I prefer Paris, or London.

22:51.158 --> 22:52.591
See, I've never been anywhere.

22:52.593 --> 22:53.959
     Well, you're here now.

22:53.961 --> 22:55.527
        Oh, that's true.

22:55.529 --> 22:57.763
           New place,
     new people, no parents.

22:57.765 --> 22:59.731
 -You know what I just realized?
              -Hmm?

22:59.733 --> 23:01.633
         You're my first
     friend here at college.

23:01.635 --> 23:04.703
      -Aw, you're mine too.
-[JR chuckles] Well, look at us.

23:04.705 --> 23:07.439
      You know, this might
  make a great story some day.

23:09.009 --> 23:12.177
         [groans] Okay,
      this isn't happening.

23:12.179 --> 23:16.148
            -Come on,
  I don't think you understand.
  -That number, that's a price.

23:16.150 --> 23:18.683
     You give me that amount
 of dollars in American currency

23:18.685 --> 23:20.152
         and you get to
       take the book home.

23:20.154 --> 23:21.987
       -Yeah, no, no, no.
      -That's how it works.

23:21.989 --> 23:24.589
      I get it, I hear what
   you're saying, I get that,

23:24.591 --> 23:25.991
        but like I said,
   if the card isn't working,

23:25.993 --> 23:28.560
        it's a financial
        aid glitch, okay?

23:28.562 --> 23:30.562
 And that's all me, I'm on that,

23:30.564 --> 23:32.898
  but there's that whole thing
 where I need books for classes,

23:32.900 --> 23:35.767
  and if I don't take them now,
 they're going to get sold out,

23:35.769 --> 23:38.203
   and then there's that thing
       where I don't have
      books for my classes,

23:38.205 --> 23:39.504
       which is a problem.

23:39.506 --> 23:43.008
 Okay, I feel like you can hear
 me, but I honestly can't tell.

23:43.010 --> 23:45.210
              $498.

23:45.212 --> 23:48.814
     -[sighs] Come on, man.
       -Sorry, hey, sorry,
     just give me a second.

23:48.816 --> 23:51.116
Compromise, compromise, you keep
  the books under the counter,

23:51.118 --> 23:52.784
      I come back tomorrow,
   when Financial Aid is open,

23:52.786 --> 23:54.920
       you got the books,
    I got the money, win-win.

23:54.922 --> 23:56.922
    -Yeah, we don't do that.
           -Hi. Hello.

23:56.924 --> 23:58.757
 Hi, I'm sorry, I'm almost done.

23:58.759 --> 24:01.593
        You're done now,
      unless you have $498.

24:01.595 --> 24:04.563
       If I had any money,
 I wouldn't be on financial aid.

24:04.565 --> 24:06.698
        -[Cashier] Next!
          -Um, would...

24:06.700 --> 24:07.933
        Will that do it?

24:07.935 --> 24:09.501
             -What?
             -What?

24:09.503 --> 24:10.869
   [scoffs] Are you for real?

24:12.039 --> 24:14.139
 I am for real, yeah. [chuckles]

24:14.141 --> 24:16.041
         Uh, wait, wait,
        wait, wait, wait.

24:17.778 --> 24:18.877
           Thank you.

24:18.879 --> 24:21.046
   [chuckles] You're welcome.

24:21.048 --> 24:23.048
          [soft music]

24:24.051 --> 24:25.717
   Okay, hi, uh, yeah, books.

24:28.522 --> 24:31.556
      Well, um, thanks for
 going to the bookstore with me.

24:31.558 --> 24:33.492
        No, my pleasure.

24:35.062 --> 24:36.695
   Did you forget your books?

24:36.697 --> 24:37.929
   Oh, no, they're in my bag.

24:38.966 --> 24:40.832
        All your books
      for all your classes

24:40.834 --> 24:42.567
     are in that little bag?

24:42.569 --> 24:45.136
     It's, uh, a deceptively
       big bag. [chuckles]

24:45.138 --> 24:46.638
       I mean, I guess so.

24:48.642 --> 24:50.175
   I'd like to see you again.

24:50.177 --> 24:52.244
   Well, sure, we're friends.

24:52.246 --> 24:54.980
        What if I want to
    be more than friends?

24:54.982 --> 24:57.015
           Well, I...

24:57.017 --> 24:59.584
        Don't freak out,
 I'm not asking you to marry me,

24:59.586 --> 25:01.086
  just, you know, maybe a date.

25:03.056 --> 25:04.689
      Think about it, okay?

25:05.926 --> 25:08.159
      I'll see you around.

25:08.161 --> 25:09.895
            Uh, bye!

25:23.010 --> 25:24.643

25:24.645 --> 25:25.777
         [Cassie sighs]

25:25.779 --> 25:27.779
        Hello, Cassandra.

25:27.781 --> 25:29.147
        Why are you just
      sitting in the dark?

25:29.149 --> 25:30.849
         You scared me.

25:30.851 --> 25:33.151
 I fetched your sweater for you.

25:34.054 --> 25:37.622
       Oh, wow, I'm sorry,
    I just, I totally forgot.

25:37.624 --> 25:40.825
  It's funny how you'd forget,
     being so cold and all.

25:40.827 --> 25:44.062
            -Pep, I--
        -You ditched me!

25:44.064 --> 25:46.698
    I looked for you all day!

25:46.700 --> 25:49.267
        I thought I lost
     Santa Claus's daughter,

25:49.269 --> 25:52.571
      ruined Christmas, and
that Santa was going to kill me,

25:52.573 --> 25:55.740
    and worse, be mad at me.
         And then I'd go
      on the naughty list,

25:55.742 --> 25:58.343
  and once you're on that list,
   it's super hard to get off!

25:59.680 --> 26:01.012
              Plus,

26:01.848 --> 26:02.914
      you hurt my feelings.

26:04.151 --> 26:07.619
Oh, Pep, I'm sorry, I really am.

26:07.621 --> 26:10.288
         No, you're not.
    I'm just some weirdo elf,

26:10.290 --> 26:12.691
and you wish that I wasn't here.

26:12.693 --> 26:14.192
        That's not true.

26:15.829 --> 26:17.295
 Okay, that's not totally true.

26:17.297 --> 26:19.130
             I just,
  I don't want a servant, okay?

26:19.132 --> 26:22.033
      I want to be normal,
          and you're...

26:22.035 --> 26:23.835
    All up in your business?

26:24.738 --> 26:25.704
              Yeah.

26:26.607 --> 26:28.173
      I can be a bit much.

26:28.175 --> 26:30.609
    I'm just trying to help.

26:30.611 --> 26:33.345
    -I don't need your help.
         -But your dad--

26:33.347 --> 26:35.213
         He's not here,
      it's just you and me,

26:35.215 --> 26:37.215
        and I don't need
       a babysitter, okay?

26:38.986 --> 26:39.951
              Okay.

26:40.821 --> 26:43.955
I will give you room to blossom.

26:46.026 --> 26:47.692
              Sure.

26:47.694 --> 26:49.127
           Thank you.

26:49.129 --> 26:50.962
 Now that that's out of the way,

26:50.964 --> 26:53.231
     what happened with you
    and the good-looking boy?

26:53.233 --> 26:56.001
            Well, um,
    we went to the bookstore,

26:56.003 --> 26:58.637
       and then we kind of
     spent the day together.

26:58.639 --> 27:00.171
         You and the boy
      with the pretty hair

27:00.173 --> 27:02.741
     spent all day together?

27:02.743 --> 27:07.212
    I'm conflicted, because,
  A, holy cow, that's awesome,

27:07.214 --> 27:11.249
     but, B, you're engaged.

27:11.251 --> 27:13.151
        I didn't mean to.
    I mean, I thought JR

27:13.153 --> 27:15.787
           and I were
     just becoming friends.

27:15.789 --> 27:19.157
          -You thought?
-Well, then he told me that

27:19.159 --> 27:21.426
 he liked me more than friends.

27:21.428 --> 27:23.161
  That's so naughty! [chuckles]

27:23.163 --> 27:25.397
       I know. [chuckles]

27:25.399 --> 27:28.900
        -That's actually,
      like, really naughty.
              -Oh.

          Okay, Cassie,
     you can do it, just...

27:38.979 --> 27:41.746
    Oh, no, nope, all right.

27:41.748 --> 27:45.183
     You can do it, you can
 go out there and make friends.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.252
              Yes.

27:50.691 --> 27:52.924
         Hi. [chuckles]
    Can I get a hot chocolate

27:52.926 --> 27:55.260
     with mini marshmallows
       and whipped cream?

27:55.262 --> 27:57.362
        -No marshmallows.
             -What?

27:57.364 --> 28:01.066
   I know, a coffee shop that
 doesn't sell tiny marshmallows,

28:01.068 --> 28:04.069
          it's insane,
  what is the world coming to?

28:04.071 --> 28:05.970
We also don't sell Italian food.

28:05.972 --> 28:07.305
        Well, you should
        really get some.

28:07.307 --> 28:08.773
          Italian food?

28:08.775 --> 28:10.308
  No, no, no, the marshmallows,

28:10.310 --> 28:11.843
     -for the hot chocolate.
           -Chocolate,

28:11.845 --> 28:13.945
   thank you, got it, awesome.

28:13.947 --> 28:16.781
   I'll go ahead and pass that
  to Greg at upper management,

28:16.783 --> 28:19.117
         he really loves
     suggestions like this.

28:19.119 --> 28:20.218
        [Cassie chuckles]

28:21.855 --> 28:23.955
        Are we done here?

28:23.957 --> 28:26.925
  No, actually, I have an idea.

28:26.927 --> 28:29.060
       Wow, it's a big day
          for you, huh?

28:29.062 --> 28:30.795
     Yeah, it is. [chuckles]

28:30.797 --> 28:33.465
          Hi, everyone.
  I'm Cassie, and I'm new here,

28:33.467 --> 28:36.167
       and I don't really
   know anybody, but I'd love
     to be friends with you,

28:36.169 --> 28:38.169
     and, um, so, I'm going
   to get you a hot chocolate,

28:38.171 --> 28:41.439
          or whatever,
  [chuckles] uh, as a present.

28:41.441 --> 28:44.809
             So, um,
   happy first day of school.

28:44.811 --> 28:47.512
  [exhales] Hey, don't do that,
 I'm the only one working today.

28:47.514 --> 28:49.114
         Hi, double shot
      of espresso, please.

28:49.116 --> 28:50.882
    -Can I get a mocha latte?
         -Medium Latte!

28:50.884 --> 28:52.350
         Robert Bremmer?

28:52.352 --> 28:54.185
        Cassandra Claus?

28:54.187 --> 28:56.921
        <i> ¶ Yeah, it hurts</i>
       <i> Being broken... ¶</i>

28:56.923 --> 28:58.456
        Cassandra Claus?

28:59.826 --> 29:00.992
           Miss Claus?

29:02.329 --> 29:04.028
       No Cassandra Claus.

29:06.199 --> 29:07.398
            Present!

29:07.400 --> 29:08.399
        [water splashing]

29:08.401 --> 29:09.968
               Aw!

29:09.970 --> 29:11.803
 <i> ¶ The winds blow secrets... ¶</i>

29:11.805 --> 29:13.004
        [whispers] Sorry.

29:14.107 --> 29:18.109

29:18.111 --> 29:20.445
            <i> ¶ Keep ¶</i>

29:21.281 --> 29:22.447
         Hi, I'm Cassie.

29:24.785 --> 29:26.151
           I'm Cassie!

29:28.021 --> 29:29.154
        What's that toy?

29:30.357 --> 29:32.924
 Oh, my god, is that your lunch?

29:32.926 --> 29:34.192
 Yeah, you don't like cupcakes?

29:44.037 --> 29:46.371
  Hey, hi. Hey, hi, don't move.

29:46.373 --> 29:48.840
   Oh, the boy with no money.

29:48.842 --> 29:50.575
    Yeah, that is who I am.

29:50.577 --> 29:52.210
        I've been looking
       everywhere for you,

29:52.212 --> 29:53.945
  you never told me your name.

29:54.848 --> 29:56.214
       Was I supposed to?

29:56.216 --> 29:57.415
              Yes.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.317
     Well, I'm Cassie Claus.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.319
   Cassie Claus, hey, I'm Sam.

30:01.321 --> 30:04.189
              -Hi.
     -Wow, uh, I just wanted
        to say thank you,

30:04.191 --> 30:07.091
         like, so much.
  That's crazy, who does that?

30:07.093 --> 30:10.161
         -Who helps out
   a total stranger like that?
 -Well, I had it and you didn't,

30:10.163 --> 30:11.896
        anyone else would
       have done the same.

30:11.898 --> 30:15.200
      No, literally nobody
     would've done the same.

30:15.202 --> 30:17.235
     Hey, $500 might not be
        a lot to you,

30:17.237 --> 30:19.070
  but it means the world to me,

30:19.072 --> 30:20.538
 and I'm going to pay you back.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.340
      Okay, if you'd like.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.242
          I would like,
     I would like very much.

30:24.244 --> 30:26.477
       I'm working on it.
    I sent seven long emails,

30:26.479 --> 30:28.947
     and I spent three hours
  in the Financial Aid Office.

30:29.950 --> 30:32.417
Hey, have you seen one of these?

30:32.419 --> 30:34.319
     So it's a phone, right?

30:34.321 --> 30:36.154
 But you can also send messages,

30:36.156 --> 30:39.390
  and you can ask it questions,
        it's like magic.

30:39.392 --> 30:42.227
  I totally get why people are
  on these things all the time.

30:42.229 --> 30:44.996
      You missed the whole
   cell phone, Internet thing,

30:44.998 --> 30:47.232
       is that what you're
      telling me right now?

30:47.234 --> 30:50.268
  Yeah. I mean, where I'm from,
    we just don't have that.

30:50.270 --> 30:52.971
 My dad still writes lists with,
  like, scrolls and parchment.

30:54.507 --> 30:55.940
   You're kind of weird, huh?

30:57.244 --> 30:59.110
  -Well, that's not very nice.
            -No, no,

30:59.112 --> 31:01.446
      it's only not nice if
 I'm saying I don't like weird,

31:01.448 --> 31:04.415
      but I happen to think
      there's a significant
   lack of weird in the world,

31:04.417 --> 31:06.885
   especially on this campus.
           I'm a fan.

31:08.054 --> 31:09.387
             Cassie.

31:10.991 --> 31:12.323
              Hey.

31:12.325 --> 31:13.424
          You're, uh...

31:14.327 --> 31:16.194
     -The guy with no money.
             -Right.

31:16.196 --> 31:18.096
      Uh, JR, this is Sam.

31:18.098 --> 31:20.198
     What's up? So, Cassie,

31:20.200 --> 31:21.633
       there's an amazing
         party tonight,

31:21.635 --> 31:24.269
    and, well, I need a date.

31:24.271 --> 31:27.272
 And I need to leave. [chuckles]

31:27.274 --> 31:28.973
        All right, well,
      catch you later, bro.

31:28.975 --> 31:30.608
   Yeah, sure, bro. [chuckles]

31:30.610 --> 31:32.443
          -Bye, Cassie.
           -Bye, Sam.

31:34.314 --> 31:35.480
              So...

31:36.516 --> 31:39.584
    -pick you up at 11?
         -11? At night?

31:39.586 --> 31:41.519
       Well, nothing cool
   happens before 11, come on.

31:42.489 --> 31:44.022
              Okay.

31:44.024 --> 31:45.523
      [groans] But I can't.

31:45.525 --> 31:47.625
          Let me guess,
   boyfriend back home, right?

31:49.062 --> 31:50.662
    We're just friends, Cass.

31:50.664 --> 31:52.530
       I mean, you want to
     meet new people, right?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.400
        Know where there
       are lots of people?

31:55.402 --> 31:57.268
            -Parties?
            -Parties.

31:59.439 --> 32:00.605
        [Cassie chuckles]

32:00.607 --> 32:02.674
          [eerie music]

32:05.011 --> 32:06.978
          [wind blows]

32:22.262 --> 32:24.262
       You can't just come
   in here whenever you want.

32:25.265 --> 32:26.698
               Oh?

32:26.700 --> 32:27.699
            Can't I?

32:28.601 --> 32:31.069
       I'm sorry, Father,

32:31.071 --> 32:32.403
     I wasn't expecting you.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.406
  You were to keep me apprised.

32:35.408 --> 32:36.708
      Classes just started.

32:39.679 --> 32:43.548
 Do you think I care about that?

32:43.550 --> 32:45.249
              Hmm?

32:45.251 --> 32:48.319
    Good grades, dean's list,

32:48.321 --> 32:51.289
    big man on campus, whoa.

32:52.125 --> 32:55.059
           Do you even
remember why I sent you here?

32:55.061 --> 32:57.395
      To make Cassie Claus
      fall in love with me.

32:57.397 --> 32:59.464
 I don't care if she loves you,

33:00.400 --> 33:04.168
           I only care
      that she marries you.

33:06.139 --> 33:07.372
         We're on track.

33:07.374 --> 33:08.740
           Oh, really?

33:09.776 --> 33:12.176
        Then who is this?

33:16.116 --> 33:17.782
   You're having her followed?

33:17.784 --> 33:21.052
          Oh, does that
   offend your sensibilities?

33:23.757 --> 33:25.590
          He's nobody.

33:25.592 --> 33:27.558
      I can arrange to have
  him removed from the campus.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.360
      No, I can handle him.

33:29.362 --> 33:30.795
             Really?

33:32.399 --> 33:34.232
      I won't let you down.

33:34.234 --> 33:37.502
If only I was confident of that.

33:42.108 --> 33:43.207
          [keys jingle]

33:43.209 --> 33:44.242
           Got to go.

33:44.244 --> 33:46.144
    Oh, by all means, go, go.

33:49.649 --> 33:52.083
             Father,
 will you be visiting regularly?

33:52.085 --> 33:55.753
         I like to keep
    an eye on my investments.

34:02.429 --> 34:04.328
          [door closes]

34:04.330 --> 34:07.065
     It sounds like a date.

34:07.067 --> 34:10.668
           -It's not.
      -He's picking you up,
     taking you to a party,

34:10.670 --> 34:12.437
    you're getting all fancy.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.304
    We're just friends, okay?

34:15.241 --> 34:18.743
      And you smelling like
 flowers is just a coincidence?

34:18.745 --> 34:20.511
          [sighs] Pep.

34:21.648 --> 34:24.581
       Your dad would have
   a reindeer if he found out.

34:28.588 --> 34:31.289
          [party music]

34:32.826 --> 34:35.560
           -You okay?
      -Yeah, it's, [groans]

34:35.562 --> 34:37.795
          It's my first
    party in the real world.

34:37.797 --> 34:40.098
     I don't know if I would
  call college the real world.

34:40.100 --> 34:42.467
       -[Cassie chuckles]
        -There's nothing
      to be nervous about.

34:42.469 --> 34:45.103
   I mean, they're just kids,

34:45.105 --> 34:46.204
         just like you.

34:46.206 --> 34:48.106
   Well, not exactly like me.

34:48.108 --> 34:49.540
         [both chuckle]

34:50.743 --> 34:51.842
               No.

34:52.846 --> 34:53.811
         No, maybe not.

34:56.516 --> 34:57.515
          [JR chuckles]

34:58.718 --> 35:02.286
    JR, there's a situation
      back in my hometown,

35:02.288 --> 35:04.822
     -and it's not changing.
           -[JR sighs]

35:04.824 --> 35:08.759
   I mean, no matter how cute
   and charming you might be--

35:08.761 --> 35:12.230
         -Oh, you think
     I'm cute and charming?
         -[both chuckle]

35:12.232 --> 35:13.631
    I'm trying to be serious.

35:13.633 --> 35:16.868
             No, no,
  I get it, you're spoken for.

35:17.804 --> 35:19.837
        He's a lucky guy.

35:19.839 --> 35:22.140
 Hey, come on, let's go mingle.

35:22.142 --> 35:24.675
              Yeah,
  I don't know how to do that.

35:24.677 --> 35:26.177
  Oh, just stick with me, kid.

35:26.179 --> 35:27.578
            -Come on.
         -[party music]

35:27.580 --> 35:29.380
        [chuckles] Okay.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.620
 Oh, my god, I love your outfit.

35:35.622 --> 35:37.622
         -Oh, thank you.
          -Oh, my gosh,
    I was sitting next to you

35:37.624 --> 35:39.824
 in English comp the other day,
 and I was trying to figure out

35:39.826 --> 35:41.559
         if that's your
       natural hair color.

35:41.561 --> 35:44.262
             -Yeah.
     -Oh, my god, it is not!

35:44.264 --> 35:46.931
     I'm getting some, like,
   major theatre major vibes.

35:46.933 --> 35:50.268
  No, no, no, they're too fun,
     I'm thinking more like
   maybe science or something.

35:50.270 --> 35:52.803
       Oh, something that
      probably doesn't make
     a lot of money, right?

35:52.805 --> 35:55.640
           Like, like,
    sociology or psychology.

35:55.642 --> 35:57.808
        Undeclared, yeah,
         I can't decide,

35:57.810 --> 36:00.845
            -I just,
   I want to learn everything.
     -Undeclared, I knew it.

36:00.847 --> 36:03.514
        You have kind of
    a whimsical, flaky vibe.

36:03.516 --> 36:07.618
     -Oh, thank you so much.
       -Are you a Scorpio?

36:07.620 --> 36:09.787
   -I don't know what that is.
 -Wait, are you going to pledge?

36:09.789 --> 36:13.391
  Oh, my god, of course she is!
       Of course you are.

36:13.393 --> 36:16.494
         -I guess, yeah.
    -Cass, Cass, I'm getting
     a drink, you want one?

36:16.496 --> 36:18.896
   Uh, thank you, yeah, sure.

36:18.898 --> 36:21.432
          -[guy] Wait.
       -So how do you two
        know each other?

36:21.434 --> 36:24.635
         -Oh, well, I--
 -Did you know that his parents
   are, like, super important?

36:24.637 --> 36:28.239
     Yeah, I heard that too,
 only I heard rich, super rich.

36:28.241 --> 36:30.241
      -It's the same thing.
    -Good point, yeah, it is.

36:30.243 --> 36:31.742
          We just met,
    so I don't really know--

36:31.744 --> 36:33.678
        You know he comes
       from money, right?

36:33.680 --> 36:36.214
  Like, old money. You can tell
     by the way he dresses.

36:36.216 --> 36:37.815
           And I mean,
     have you seen his car?

36:37.817 --> 36:41.252
              -No.
          -He lives on
     the West Campus condos.

36:41.254 --> 36:42.353
              -Wow.
              -Wow.

36:42.355 --> 36:43.921
      [boy] I know, right?

36:44.824 --> 36:46.891
    [JR] Cassie, here you go.

36:46.893 --> 36:48.426
         Thanks so much.

36:48.428 --> 36:50.428
      So, what did I miss?

36:50.430 --> 36:51.862
          Cassie didn't
       know you were rich.

36:51.864 --> 36:53.264
        [water splashes]

36:53.266 --> 36:55.533
 Oh, my god, are you kidding me?

36:56.936 --> 36:58.502
          [party music]

36:59.839 --> 37:01.706
        What do you know?

37:01.708 --> 37:03.474
        It's Cassie Claus
 looking distraught. [chuckles]

37:03.476 --> 37:05.443
  Sam, what are you doing here?

37:05.445 --> 37:07.445
        I'm stalking you.
      No, I'm just kidding,

37:07.447 --> 37:10.448
         it's a shortcut
        from the library,
     and I heard the music,

37:10.450 --> 37:13.417
       I thought I'd stand
     outside the party sad.

37:13.419 --> 37:15.653
   Never mind, what's going on
     with you? Are you okay?

37:15.655 --> 37:17.622
   Do you know what vodka is?

37:17.624 --> 37:19.457
 Yes, I think I've heard of it.

37:19.459 --> 37:21.826
       Yeah, okay, so you
  know it tastes nasty, right?

37:21.828 --> 37:24.795
             -Sure.
-Okay, JR poured me a cup of it,

37:24.797 --> 37:27.732
  and I took a big gulp, 'cause
  I thought it was soda, and...

37:27.734 --> 37:29.800
       [groans] now I feel
       like a total idiot.

37:30.837 --> 37:33.037
            Why?
  Because you don't like vodka?

37:33.039 --> 37:35.773
 No. 'Cause I spit it on a girl.

37:35.775 --> 37:39.343
           -Oh, yikes.
         -Yeah, and now
       I just want to die.

37:39.345 --> 37:41.345
      -Reasonable reaction.
            -Mm-hmm.

37:41.347 --> 37:44.382
  Your standing in the college
 social hierarchy is threatened.

37:44.384 --> 37:46.317
        Yeah, you should
   probably just quit school.

37:46.319 --> 37:48.552
     Or, you could blow off
           this party

37:48.554 --> 37:50.755
 -and you come hang out with me.
          I don't know,
       -[Cassie chuckles]

37:50.757 --> 37:53.791
   either one, but I'd go with
   option B, we can hang out.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.060
   Hey, I talked Brianna down.

37:57.997 --> 38:01.932
           -You again?
        -[chuckles] Yeah,
        like a bad penny.

38:01.934 --> 38:04.635
   -Private party, dude, okay?
             -Yeah.

38:04.637 --> 38:06.470
        Yeah, I'm going.

38:06.472 --> 38:09.373
          This is, uh,
     my friend here though,

38:09.375 --> 38:10.808
 so maybe don't spike her drink.

38:10.810 --> 38:13.344
        Society frowns on
      that stuff, you know?

38:13.346 --> 38:14.312
            So do I.

38:16.616 --> 38:18.349
             -Okay.
             -Mkay.

38:18.351 --> 38:19.450
          Bye, Cassie.

38:25.658 --> 38:28.726
        Look, when I said
  I was getting you a drink...

38:30.930 --> 38:33.431
      -well, I thought you
    understood that I meant--
           -Well, I--

38:33.433 --> 38:35.933
 Look, it's all new to me, I...

38:39.639 --> 38:41.739
   You want to go back inside?

38:41.741 --> 38:43.007
              Yeah.

38:43.009 --> 38:43.974
            Come on.

38:44.944 --> 38:47.345
          [eerie music]

38:56.122 --> 38:58.589
         -Good evening.
         -Oh. [chuckles]

38:58.591 --> 39:00.424
 Hey, man, you scared me there,

39:00.426 --> 39:02.893
         in the bushes,
     but, did you see that?

39:02.895 --> 39:04.962
     I think that was snow,
          it's August.

39:04.964 --> 39:06.364
        Look at me, Sam.

39:07.533 --> 39:08.632
    How do you know my name?

39:08.634 --> 39:10.735
     I know a lot of things.

39:10.737 --> 39:12.837
     I know that you're late
 in paying your college tuition,

39:12.839 --> 39:14.605
  you're working minimum wage,

39:14.607 --> 39:16.774
       I also know you're
   friends with Cassie Claus,

39:16.776 --> 39:19.844
        and I would like
       to offer you a job.

39:19.846 --> 39:22.446
       Okay, I'm going to
    go with a resounding no,

39:22.448 --> 39:24.782
         'cause you are
     freaking me out, dude.

39:24.784 --> 39:28.619
      I'm from out of town.

39:28.621 --> 39:30.621
     [chuckles] No kidding.

39:30.623 --> 39:33.124
   Your friend Cassie's father
   is worried about her, Sam.

39:33.993 --> 39:37.161
   She's led a sheltered life,
   never been out on her own.

39:38.398 --> 39:41.399
    I would like to tell her
  father that a nice young man

39:41.401 --> 39:45.035
    is keeping an eye on her.

39:47.039 --> 39:48.672
      That's the job offer?

39:48.674 --> 39:52.443
       You want to pay me
    to watch out for Cassie?

39:52.445 --> 39:53.778
     And to keep me updated.

39:56.549 --> 39:58.048
             I mean,
  I'm not going to spy on her.

39:58.050 --> 40:02.153
       Just be her friend,
        Sam, that's all.

40:02.155 --> 40:04.021
        Now I can put you
      on retainer for, uh,

40:04.023 --> 40:06.056
       oh, let's say $500?

40:13.966 --> 40:16.100

40:21.140 --> 40:22.540
        [Cassie chuckles]

40:24.977 --> 40:26.610
   I had a great time tonight.

40:26.612 --> 40:28.212
     Yeah, it was super fun,

40:28.214 --> 40:30.114
      other than the whole
   me embarrassing myself bit.

40:30.116 --> 40:31.449
       No, no, no, no, no,

40:31.451 --> 40:33.884
    that was my fault, okay?

40:34.787 --> 40:36.754
         -And I'm sorry.
  -Yeah, you already said that.

40:36.756 --> 40:38.756
         -[JR chuckles]
      -And it's still okay.

40:41.027 --> 40:43.661
    You know, just getting to
 be near you tonight, it was...

40:47.166 --> 40:49.834
     Hi there, party people!

40:49.836 --> 40:52.536
         -[JR chuckles]
    -Did you raise the roof?

40:52.538 --> 40:56.707
       You know, I'm beat,
it's getting pretty late, right?

40:56.709 --> 40:59.143
 And you should go to bed, sis.

40:59.145 --> 41:00.678
          In a minute.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.648
            Go away.

41:06.919 --> 41:08.185
        [Cassie chuckles]

41:08.187 --> 41:10.087
  Sorry about that. [chuckles]

41:10.923 --> 41:12.823
               Um,

41:12.825 --> 41:14.625
         goodnight, JR.

  Smith and Christopher Branch]

        Oh, hey, thanks.

41:37.250 --> 41:40.618
     Wait, could I get some,
    um, whipped cream?

41:41.954 --> 41:44.221
      Yeah, and do you want
    some sprinkles and, like,

41:44.223 --> 41:45.890
      a cherry on top too?

41:45.892 --> 41:47.124
     That would be so nice.

    Oh, yeah, where I'm from,
     everybody eats sweets,

41:55.601 --> 41:57.167
         but I'm really
       trying to cut back.

41:57.169 --> 41:59.870
         Now I only eat
    sweets when I'm stressed,

41:59.872 --> 42:02.773
    or celebrating, or bored.

42:03.609 --> 42:05.976
Right now, I'm stressed, so...

42:05.978 --> 42:07.778
       It's a good system,
         why the stress?

   know that. [clears throat]

   'cause I'm a generous guy.

       many obvious gifts,

       [chuckles] Really?

42:45.251 --> 42:46.750
        You doubt me?

     you seem like you would
 pretend to be good at calculus

           just so you
     could hang out with me.

    that is so modest of you,

            -Come on.
      -Wait, we're leaving?

we're leaving, change of locale.

     get some frosting fuel.

need to use the first derivative

43:25.391 --> 43:28.058
      to find the equation
   of the quadratic function.

 sounded really smart just then,

     -are you a math major?
          -Uh, pre-law.

43:32.331 --> 43:34.231
    Wow, I didn't know that.

43:34.233 --> 43:35.899
  Well, you don't know anything
      about me. [chuckles]

43:35.901 --> 43:37.935
 And I know even less about you.

43:37.937 --> 43:40.304
     You're, like, the most
  elusive person I've ever met.

43:40.306 --> 43:41.805
     That's not true at all.

43:41.807 --> 43:44.174
    Okay, where are you from?

43:45.077 --> 43:46.243
           I'm from...

43:47.146 --> 43:48.912
             North.

            Up north.

43:50.149 --> 43:52.850

         Who says that?
     You're like an enigma.

 Come on, let's get down to it.

43:56.122 --> 43:57.821
      We'll go one for one,
     you ask me a question,

43:57.823 --> 44:00.791
      I ask you a question,
    we have to answer, deal?

44:00.793 --> 44:02.860
            No, okay,
   this is complicated for me.

44:03.796 --> 44:05.362
        Bock, bock, bock,
  bock, bock, bock, bock, bock.

44:05.364 --> 44:07.331
         Are you really
     making chicken noises?

44:07.333 --> 44:09.433
  I make a mean chicken noise.
  Bock, bock, bock, bock, bock.

44:09.435 --> 44:11.301
           All right,
     okay, fine, fine, okay,

44:11.303 --> 44:15.839
   I, I will do it, but I get
   to ask the first question.

44:17.943 --> 44:19.810
              Okay?

44:19.811 --> 44:21.678
            Okay, um,
 why do you want to be a lawyer?

44:22.882 --> 44:25.783
    An occupational question,
     very bold and exciting.

44:25.785 --> 44:27.251
        All right, well,
  my dad has a lot of lawyers,

44:27.253 --> 44:29.453
  and they always seem anxious.

44:29.455 --> 44:32.022
Okay, well, I'm anxious already,
      so I figured why not?

44:32.024 --> 44:34.692
           You're not
     answering the question.

44:34.694 --> 44:38.062
  All right, so, buzzkill, um,

      I was in foster care.

44:46.105 --> 44:49.339

this lawyer woman who helped me.

          or for money,

    anything about your mom.

    Not cool, man, not cool!

54:35.661 --> 54:38.695
    You, I'm not in the mood
  for your freaky stuff, okay?

54:38.697 --> 54:39.896
      I've had a rough day.

54:39.898 --> 54:42.565
   What do you have to report?

54:42.567 --> 54:46.002
 Um, uh, I have to report that I
had a little heart attack, okay?

54:46.004 --> 54:48.938
         Not a big one,
  but an EKG would confirm it.

54:48.940 --> 54:50.640
      [Jack clears throat]

54:50.642 --> 54:56.813
        What do you want?
      Man, Cassie aced her
  calculus midterm, how's that?

54:56.815 --> 54:58.982
    Tell her dad she's fine.

54:58.984 --> 55:01.051
         I'm afraid your
   assurances are not enough.

55:02.788 --> 55:05.088
  Unless, of course, you would
 like Miss Claus to become aware

55:05.090 --> 55:08.758
          of the money
     that has changed hands?

55:12.998 --> 55:14.748
  Whoa, you're threatening me?

55:14.749 --> 55:16.499
            I've been
   watching out for her, man.
 I haven't done anything wrong.

55:16.501 --> 55:19.069
        I doubt she would
        see it that way.

55:21.506 --> 55:23.373
     She's been hanging out
      with some preppy guy.

55:24.843 --> 55:27.377
 Says they're just friends, um,

55:27.379 --> 55:29.379
          she also said
  she's in some sort of, like,

55:29.381 --> 55:31.381
           old-school
 arranged marriage or something,

55:31.383 --> 55:33.550
       but I'm pretty sure
    she's making that up too.

55:33.552 --> 55:35.118
      No, go on, elaborate.

55:37.356 --> 55:41.124
She said her dad is Santa Claus.
   Cassie Claus, funny, right?

55:41.126 --> 55:44.027
 Said she's from the North Pole,
    is traveling with an elf.

55:44.029 --> 55:46.963
          But you don't
      believe her, do you?

55:46.965 --> 55:48.865
  I'm not six years old, dude.

55:48.867 --> 55:50.367
         And no one else
       in this university

55:50.369 --> 55:51.668
    would believe her either.

55:52.938 --> 55:57.674
         They may think
      she's mad. [chuckles]

55:57.676 --> 55:59.809
   [Jack laughs hysterically]

56:02.681 --> 56:04.881
   Okay, um, no offense, man,

56:04.883 --> 56:08.985
   but your social skills are,
 like, off-the-charts terrible.

56:08.987 --> 56:10.553
  Spend more time with people,

56:10.555 --> 56:11.955

      of fantasy football?

       met my sister, Pep?

56:42.821 --> 56:44.921
           Oh em gee,

   in public with those ears?

 she sure sounds like one to me.

        That's my sister
      you're talking about.

56:54.699 --> 56:57.534
  Well, your sister's a freak,
         and so are you!

56:57.536 --> 56:59.135
  It's okay, Cassie, let's go.

        Well, your buddy
       from the bookstore,

   This doesn't look like me.
    We don't look like this.

57:38.743 --> 57:40.243
  This is a misrepresentation!

57:43.181 --> 57:46.115
 Elves are fictional characters,
     but if they were real,

57:46.117 --> 57:48.585
  they'd be way more attractive
    than these stupid photos!

      our friendship, but--

       you something, pal,

I had something to do with this.

 Santa memes? How much free time

  when it comes to hurting me,

     anyone except for you.

     one person about that.

       you some questions

01:03:42.507 --> 01:03:44.507
    about that mysterious man
      you were talking to.

01:03:45.476 --> 01:03:47.076
   Did he have a pointy face?

01:03:47.078 --> 01:03:48.377
       Pointy face? Yeah.

             -Yeah.

01:03:50.181 --> 01:03:52.081

     when you were near him?

            -Shivers?
  -Shivers, man, were you cold?

01:03:55.053 --> 01:03:56.953
     Yeah, yeah, I was cold.

Santa's real, I'm freaking real!

        Now let's get to
     what actually matters,

01:04:09.868 --> 01:04:11.901
  how do you feel about Cassie?

01:04:11.903 --> 01:04:13.402
        It doesn't matter
    how I feel, she hates me.

      No, she doesn't, Sam,

01:04:15.406 --> 01:04:17.373
         I can tell when
        she looks at you.

 you have to follow your heart,

01:04:28.152 --> 01:04:30.052
       and if you like her
     the way I think you do,

01:04:30.054 --> 01:04:31.454
   then you have to tell her.

01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:34.957
       That was inspiring.

        I think you
   would've really liked him.

01:12:26.897 --> 01:12:29.465
     It doesn't matter now,
     'cause I'm never going
        to see him again,

01:12:29.467 --> 01:12:31.066
 and that's just the way it is.

01:12:32.536 --> 01:12:34.136
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just...

01:12:36.407 --> 01:12:38.407
 Can you just give me a minute?

01:12:38.409 --> 01:12:40.075
  I'll be okay, I will, I just,

01:12:41.045 --> 01:12:42.778
        I just need to be
    alone for a minute, okay?

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:47.983
              Yeah.

01:12:59.764 --> 01:13:02.064
       -What was it like?
        -Were they nice?

01:13:02.066 --> 01:13:05.501
    I bet they were naughty.
 There are lots of naughty ones,
       aren't there, Pep?

01:13:05.503 --> 01:13:09.004
   Real people aren't so bad.
 They worry about silly things,

01:13:09.006 --> 01:13:10.606
and they don't eat enough sugar,

01:13:10.608 --> 01:13:12.641
            and they
   definitely could be nicer,

01:13:12.643 --> 01:13:14.676
          but they try.

01:13:14.678 --> 01:13:16.412
   I think it's harder there.

01:13:17.148 --> 01:13:19.114
Of course, I was really popular.

01:13:19.116 --> 01:13:20.749
          [all chuckle]

01:13:20.751 --> 01:13:22.918
          The boys just
     threw themselves at me.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.754
      Pop, you're in charge
         til I get back.

01:13:25.756 --> 01:13:29.191
   -Oh, but, sir, the wedding?
 -Oh, I'll be back before then.

01:13:29.193 --> 01:13:31.059
   I'm counting on you, Plip.

01:13:33.497 --> 01:13:35.464
 I've got to go, I've got a lot
       of responsibilities

01:13:35.466 --> 01:13:38.033
         now that I have
     real-world experience.

01:13:38.035 --> 01:13:40.602
          -[elves gasp]
   -She is so cool. [chuckles]

          [soft music]

01:13:46.644 --> 01:13:48.043
            [chimes]

01:13:48.045 --> 01:13:50.045
          -Sam, right?
          -[Sam gasps]

01:13:52.783 --> 01:13:54.683
        You're, uh, who?

01:13:58.055 --> 01:14:00.856
       Cassandra's father.

01:14:00.857 --> 01:14:03.658
             -Santa?
     -I don't think we're on
 a first-name basis yet, do you?

01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:05.194
          Yeah, no, no.

01:14:05.196 --> 01:14:07.529
         Uh, Mr. Claus.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.899
           What's up?

01:14:10.901 --> 01:14:14.169
     My daughter, she seems
    to be quite fond of you.

01:14:15.539 --> 01:14:18.006
      Well, I'm pretty sure
  she's marrying someone else.

01:14:18.008 --> 01:14:19.608
  Don't you think I know that?

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:21.176
        Yeah, no, no, no,
        you probably do.

01:14:21.178 --> 01:14:22.778
      That's why I'm here.

01:14:23.848 --> 01:14:25.948
     She's only marrying him
     because I asked her to,

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:29.518
       but I'm starting to
   think that maybe, possibly,

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.154
        it's conceivable
   I may have made a mistake.

01:14:33.123 --> 01:14:34.690
       Is that a question?

01:14:34.692 --> 01:14:36.725
   I've checked you out, Sam,

01:14:36.727 --> 01:14:39.061
         you've been on
the nice list every single year.

01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:42.564
     You know, that's quite
 impressive in this day and age.

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:45.534
           What do you
      think of my daughter?

01:14:46.504 --> 01:14:47.703
      I think she's the...

01:14:48.939 --> 01:14:50.639
       weirdest [chuckles]

01:14:50.641 --> 01:14:54.710
        most fun, smart,
  beautiful girl I've ever met.

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.846
            Come on.

01:14:57.848 --> 01:14:59.781
       Let's take a ride.

01:14:59.783 --> 01:15:01.083
         Call me Santa.

01:15:02.653 --> 01:15:04.219
              Okay,

01:15:04.221 --> 01:15:06.221
             Santa.

01:15:06.223 --> 01:15:08.991
          [jazzy music]

01:15:14.765 --> 01:15:16.098
           Excuse me.

01:15:19.637 --> 01:15:20.602
           Pardon me.

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:27.276
              Move!

01:15:29.079 --> 01:15:30.045
           Thank you.

01:15:32.883 --> 01:15:35.117
        [dramatic music]

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.020
        What's the delay?

01:15:39.023 --> 01:15:41.757
      All the best weddings
    start late, it's a thing.

01:15:43.027 --> 01:15:45.928
 And why am I talking to an elf?

01:15:47.031 --> 01:15:47.996
         Where's Claus?

01:15:47.998 --> 01:15:52.935
    The elf you're talking to
    happens to be in charge,

01:15:52.937 --> 01:15:55.137
     and Mr. Claus is busy,

01:15:55.139 --> 01:15:57.973
    and as soon as he's not,
     I'll send him your way.

01:15:57.975 --> 01:15:59.308
           Excuse me.

01:16:07.851 --> 01:16:10.819
         We have to pull
      the trigger on this,
     Frost is getting anxy.

01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:12.988
    Where is my dad? I mean,
    where could he have gone?

01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:14.790
      Pep, where is my dad?

01:16:15.859 --> 01:16:16.925
        [dramatic music]

01:16:16.927 --> 01:16:18.627
           It's time.

01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:20.295
        Um, knock-knock.

01:16:20.297 --> 01:16:22.230
Now, our contract clearly states

01:16:22.232 --> 01:16:23.765
that the wedding must take place

01:16:23.767 --> 01:16:26.635
 on Christmas Eve before sunset.

01:16:26.637 --> 01:16:28.370
           Mr. Frost,
     my dad isn't here yet--

01:16:28.372 --> 01:16:31.673
         If the wedding
   doesn't begin immediately,

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:36.178
      the Claus family will
    be in breach of contract,

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.882
   and all of Kringle Industry
  will revert to Frost and Son.

01:16:40.884 --> 01:16:45.754
   The toys, the distribution,
     the glory will be mine.

01:16:47.224 --> 01:16:48.824
        Make your choice.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:54.963

01:16:54.965 --> 01:16:56.331
           Smart girl.

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:57.366
             Well...

01:16:57.368 --> 01:17:00.736
         I'll have them
   start the "Wedding March".

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:08.043
       I do not like him.

01:17:09.013 --> 01:17:11.046
      I'm ready to do what
    I have to for my family.

01:17:14.418 --> 01:17:15.751
             Pep...

01:17:17.955 --> 01:17:19.721
  I'm really glad you're here.

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:31.433
              -Wow.
   -Expected reindeer, right?

01:17:31.435 --> 01:17:33.268
         Everybody does,
    but they're inefficient,

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:35.337
 and they smell to high heaven.

01:17:35.339 --> 01:17:38.373
      But I got to use 'em,
    tonight, part of the gig.

01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:41.977
   So Cassie says that you're,
        um, studying law,

   I want a way out, find it.

01:17:47.384 --> 01:17:49.084
       Where are we going?

01:17:49.086 --> 01:17:51.053
     North Pole, of course.

01:17:51.055 --> 01:17:53.188
    Whoa, hold on, you can't
    drive to the North Pole.

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:54.990
         No, you can't.

  650 reindeer under the hood,

            -Come on.
      -Do I need a jacket?

01:18:03.701 --> 01:18:05.167
    No, I'll put the top up.

        to bring together
     these two young people

01:19:39.797 --> 01:19:41.329
   in the bonds of matrimony.

       these two families
   hold a very special place,

      they will be forever
 joined by this lad and lassie,

  If anyone here has any reason

          why these two
       should not be wed--

01:19:59.283 --> 01:20:00.916
           -We don't.
              -Huh?

        -I'm sorry, lass?
             -What?

             Oh, um,

01:20:08.592 --> 01:20:10.525
    I guess that's because...

        We don't actually
        love each other.

 front of the whole university,

marry you either, I'm too young,

01:21:33.443 --> 01:21:35.243
          Uh-huh, okay.

01:21:35.245 --> 01:21:37.212
            -Cassie.
            -Mm-hmm?

01:21:37.214 --> 01:21:38.580
    I'm in love with you too.

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:42.484
          [soft music]

01:21:45.122 --> 01:21:47.422
     I'm pretty sure I'm in
    the clear on this thing.

01:21:47.424 --> 01:21:48.390
              Aye.

01:21:50.127 --> 01:21:53.028
   Claus, get that boy's mouth
           off of her!

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:54.629
      I'm just going to go.

01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:56.298
            Oh, yeah,
    do your thing. [chuckles]

01:21:57.467 --> 01:22:01.069
       Dad, I'm so sorry.
  I'm sorry about the wedding,

01:22:01.071 --> 01:22:02.570
      I said I was going to
    do the thing, and then--

01:22:02.572 --> 01:22:04.472
       You're headstrong,
     just like your mother,

01:22:04.474 --> 01:22:06.308
      I'm so proud of you.

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.376
 No, no, no, we have a contract.

01:22:08.378 --> 01:22:10.211
        Which you broke,
       talk to my lawyer.

01:22:12.316 --> 01:22:14.482
 Oh, yeah, no, that's me, okay.

01:22:14.484 --> 01:22:17.218
Uh, this is your contract, uh...

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.254
            [humming]

01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:24.125
          Section one,
   article B, paragraph nine,

01:22:24.127 --> 01:22:27.128
   "Should either party make a
 statement they know to be false

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:30.031
       or otherwise act in
     such a way to mislead,

01:22:30.033 --> 01:22:32.167
            deceive,
   or defame the other party,"

01:22:32.169 --> 01:22:34.502
      you know, like spying
   on her the last six months

01:22:34.504 --> 01:22:36.371
          or spreading
   rumors about her at school,

01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:38.306
    "then this contract shall
   be rendered null and void."

01:22:38.308 --> 01:22:40.675
 -That has nothing to do with--
      -The marriage is off.

01:22:40.677 --> 01:22:43.478
 It was a mistake to begin with.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.214
  You won't survive without us.

01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:50.986
       Goodness, charity,
  those are things of the past.

01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:54.990
 Christmas cheer needs a patron.

01:22:56.293 --> 01:22:58.460
    You know, the numbers,
   they say that you're right,

01:22:59.463 --> 01:23:04.632
      but in a few moments,
       I'm going to climb
  into an old-fashioned sleigh,

01:23:04.634 --> 01:23:09.604
    and I'm going to deliver
    presents to lots and lots
          of children,

01:23:09.606 --> 01:23:12.474
  and that's not about profit,
      that's about giving.

01:23:13.577 --> 01:23:16.711
    I was so intent on
      saving our business,

01:23:16.713 --> 01:23:19.314
   I forgot what our business
        was really about.

01:23:21.118 --> 01:23:24.119
    Your mother was the best
 thing that ever happened to me.

01:23:24.121 --> 01:23:27.455
 I was so lucky that our parents
promised us to each other.

01:23:28.525 --> 01:23:31.159
          But that was
      our life, not yours.

01:23:32.362 --> 01:23:34.429
         I just want you
      to be happy, Cassie.

01:23:38.635 --> 01:23:40.668
      You're a fool, Claus.

01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:43.371
       Son, we're leaving!

01:23:43.373 --> 01:23:44.672
          [jolly music]

01:23:45.609 --> 01:23:48.043
              Hey,
  I'm really sorry about this.

01:23:48.045 --> 01:23:49.677
   Are you kidding? [chuckles]

01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:52.180
-No way am I ready for marriage.
       -[Cassie chuckles]

01:23:52.182 --> 01:23:53.648
     And good luck with Sam.

01:23:54.518 --> 01:23:56.785
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:04.793
    You, you will rue the day
  you crossed the Frost family.

01:24:07.297 --> 01:24:08.797

     [laughter and gasping]

01:24:14.204 --> 01:24:17.372
  -Claus! I know you did this!
     -What a waste of cake.

01:24:17.374 --> 01:24:20.341
      [jazzy festive music]

01:24:20.343 --> 01:24:21.709
          [Jack groans]

01:24:25.348 --> 01:24:27.649
     -[Sam] No, you got it.
        -No, help me with
         the skirt part,

01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:30.752
       -I think it's-- Oh!
         -[both chuckle]

01:24:30.754 --> 01:24:32.554
       There's that smile.

01:24:33.423 --> 01:24:36.091
     [woman] Want a cookie?
      Fresh from the oven.

01:24:36.093 --> 01:24:38.460
 Oh, no, I'm on a low-carb diet.

01:24:38.462 --> 01:24:41.663
     Oh, no, don't be silly.

01:24:42.699 --> 01:24:45.733
       You could stand to
      put on a few pounds.

01:24:45.735 --> 01:24:47.368
        [Santa chuckles]

01:24:48.305 --> 01:24:50.572
     Oh, I'll take a cookie.

01:24:52.509 --> 01:24:55.710
          Mm, that is--
      these are very good.

01:24:57.147 --> 01:24:58.713
           I'm Santa.

01:24:58.715 --> 01:24:59.681
             I know.

01:25:04.888 --> 01:25:08.590
      -So, you met my Dad.
           -Big step.

01:25:08.592 --> 01:25:10.725
             -Huge.
         -[Sam chuckles]

01:25:10.727 --> 01:25:13.128
      We're not rushing to
the altar or anything like that,

01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:18.500
      but, uh, do you maybe
    want to be my girlfriend?

01:25:19.603 --> 01:25:21.269
              Yeah.

01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:23.738
             -Yeah?
        -[chuckles] Yeah.

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.406
              -Cool
             -Cool.

01:25:25.408 --> 01:25:28.843
        So, are you going
       to kiss me or what?

01:25:28.845 --> 01:25:30.712
             -Yeah.
        -[both chuckle]

01:25:30.714 --> 01:25:33.581
         [upbeat music]

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:35.250
        [Cassie chuckles]

01:25:36.586 --> 01:25:37.819
              Ahem.

01:25:38.722 --> 01:25:40.522
     That's enough of that.

01:25:40.524 --> 01:25:44.392
       Sam, how would you
 like to spend a few days here?

01:25:45.362 --> 01:25:47.729
   -I mean, is that all right?
        -It's up to you.

01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:50.865
         I mean, no one
  should be alone at Christmas.

01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:52.767
         [Sam chuckles]

01:25:52.769 --> 01:25:54.769
        Where's my girl?

01:25:54.771 --> 01:25:56.171
               Aw.

01:25:58.842 --> 01:26:01.709
        Oh, and don't eat
        all the cookies!

01:26:01.711 --> 01:26:05.246
        I got to fill out
    the suit, huh? [chuckles]

01:26:06.917 --> 01:26:08.750
           Santa out.

01:26:11.288 --> 01:26:12.887
           All right,
    your family is so weird.

01:26:12.889 --> 01:26:15.723
     Ah, there's a shortage
     of weird in the world.

01:26:15.725 --> 01:26:17.625
         [both chuckle]

01:26:21.898 --> 01:26:25.833
        [Santa] Ho ho ho!
        Merry Christmas!
