I mean, everyone
in this town is so nice.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.609
Yeah, what's the catch?

00:25.693 --> 00:29.029
-You're all set.
-Okay. Thanks.

00:31.323 --> 00:34.410

back to the interstate.

-Take Lasky straight out of town.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.736

01:08.944 --> 01:11.113

Looks like a house over there.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.876
No, I'm not going in there.

We can't just wait here.

-Okay.

Check it out.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.503
-If I only had a brain.
-We wouldn't be lost.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.338

We've been

What about you and Dean?

Yeah. It's a demon, Sam.

I do.

Listen, Sammy, I, uh....

05:01.552 --> 05:04.304
I also know
what happened to your girlfriend.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.517
I'm so sorry.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.978
I would've done anything
to protect you from that.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.523
You know where it is?

05:15.190 --> 05:17.317

I'm finally closing in on him.

-Listen, Sammy, that's why I'm calling.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.328
You and your brother,
you gotta stop looking for me.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.998
Now, I need you to
write down these names.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.087

Now, you stop following me,
and you do your job, you understand me?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.773
Now, take down these names.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.151
Dad, it's me. Where are you?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.449
Yes, sir.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.037
Uh.... Yeah, I got a pen.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.664
What are the names?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.922
All right, so the names Dad gave us,
they're all couples?

06:20.005 --> 06:22.049
Three different couples,
all went missing.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.052
-From different towns, different states?
-That's right, yeah.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.346
Washington, New York, Colorado.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.932
Each couple took a road trip
cross-country.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.102
None arrived at their destination
or were ever heard from again.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.269
It's a big country.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.688
-They could've disappeared anywhere.
-Could've.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.983
But each one's route took them
through the same part of Indiana.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.821
Always on the second week of April,
one year after another after another.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.657
-This is the second week of April.
-Yep.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.951
So Dad is sending us to Indiana...

06:49.159 --> 06:52.663
...to go hunting for something
before another couple vanishes?

06:53.288 --> 06:54.957

a pattern like this?

Dad had to go through?

07:00.796 --> 07:02.923

07:06.802 --> 07:08.554
What are you doing?

07:09.513 --> 07:11.181
We're not going to Indiana.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.101
-We're not?
-No, we're going to California.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.978
Dad called from a pay phone.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.480
-With a Sacramento area code.
-Sam.

07:18.647 --> 07:23.277
Dean, if this demon killed Mom and Jess,
and Dad's closing in, we gotta be there.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.863
-We gotta help.
-Dad doesn't want our help.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.991
-Well, I don't care.
-He has given us an order.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.784
I don't care.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.121
We don't always
have to do what he says.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.125
Sam, Dad is asking us to work jobs,
to save lives. It's important.

07:38.333 --> 07:42.087
All right, I understand. Believe me.
But I'm talking one week here, man.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.965
To get answers. To get revenge.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.676
-All right, look, I know how you feel.
-Do you?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.307
How old were you
when Mom died? Four?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.644
Jess died six months ago.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.063
How the hell
would you know how I feel?

08:01.315 --> 08:04.484
Dad said it wasn't safe for any of us.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.695
He obviously knows something
that we don't.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.488
If he says stay away,
we stay away.

08:08.697 --> 08:12.367
I don't understand the blind faith
you have in the man.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.995
I mean, it's like you don't
even question him.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.997

don't care what anybody thinks.

-That's what you really think?
-Yes, it is.

08:39.478 --> 08:44.691
Well, then this selfish bastard
is going to California.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.320
-Come on, you're not serious.
-I am serious.

saved our lives.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.409
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

19:19.617 --> 19:23.288
One of our brake lines was leaking.
We had no idea. He's fixing it for us.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.790
-Nice people.
-Yeah.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.835
-So how long until you up and running?
-Sundown.

we'd rather have a mechanic do it.

smart enough to scare away a husband.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.420
No. It's just...

were infused with magic.

I'm working on it.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.461
Can you see?

34:47.544 --> 34:49.963
-What?
-Is he moving yet?

34:50.756 --> 34:52.049
I can't see.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.513
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

35:00.098 --> 35:01.725
SAM:
Dean?

35:03.435 --> 35:04.686
(DEAN SIGHS)

35:04.895 --> 35:06.522
I take everything back I said.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.106
I'm so happy to see you.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.025
Come on.

35:10.484 --> 35:14.446
-How'd you get here?
-I, uh, stole a car.

35:14.655 --> 35:17.491
Ha-ha-ha! That's my boy.

35:17.574 --> 35:20.577
Keep an eye on that scarecrow.
He could come alive any minute.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.830
What scarecrow?

35:37.177 --> 35:39.805
SAM: All right. Now, this sacred tree
you're talking about.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.516
-It's the source of its power.
-So let's burn it.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.894
In the morning. Let's just shag ass
before Leatherface catches up.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.480
(GUN COCKS)

35:50.566 --> 35:51.984
This way.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.666
Please let us go.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.085
It'll be over quickly, I promise.

36:10.294 --> 36:12.838
-Please!
-Emily, you have to let him take you.

36:13.046 --> 36:14.214
You have to--

36:14.423 --> 36:16.550
(SCREAMING)

36:30.981 --> 36:32.733
Come on, come on. Let's go.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.797
Let me.

37:37.631 --> 37:40.008
You know,
the whole town's gonna die.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.552
Good.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.564
Think she's gonna be all right?

38:36.023 --> 38:37.691
I hope so.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.695
And the rest of the townspeople,
they'll just get away with it?

38:41.778 --> 38:45.782
What will happen to the town
will have to be punishment enough.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.872
So can I drop you off somewhere?

38:52.873 --> 38:55.625
No, I think you're stuck with me.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.297
-What made you change your mind?
-I didn't.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.967
I still wanna find Dad.
And you're still a pain in the ass.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.888
But Jess and Mom...

39:08.805 --> 39:10.265
...they're both gone.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.811
Dad is God knows where.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.273
You and me...

39:18.982 --> 39:20.650
...we're all that's left.

39:21.777 --> 39:25.781
So, uh, if we're gonna
see this through...

39:27.616 --> 39:29.785
...we're gonna do it together.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.581
Hold me, Sam.

39:34.748 --> 39:38.001
That was beautiful. Come on.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.962
You should be kissing my ass.
You were dead meat, dude.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.757
Yeah, right. I had a plan.
I'd have gotten out.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.550
Right.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.609
So where to, pretty lady?

40:05.487 --> 40:06.863
How about you pull over?

40:09.199 --> 40:12.452
Okay. That works.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.603
What's that?

40:38.812 --> 40:41.106
I've got to make a call.

40:41.273 --> 40:44.651
-I got a cell you can use.
-It's not that kind of call.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.706
Thanks for the ride.

41:13.847 --> 41:16.433
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)

41:23.732 --> 41:25.358
It makes no sense.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.485
I could have stopped Sam.

41:28.612 --> 41:32.282
Hell, I could've taken them both.
Why let them go?

41:35.785 --> 41:37.746
Yes.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.626
Yes.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.423
Yes, Father.
