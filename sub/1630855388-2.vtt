WEBVTT

00:17.309 --> 00:18.310
Who are you?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.688
Look, these people--

00:23.690 --> 00:25.234
these people don't mean anything to me.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.736
I don't know any of these people,
but if they try something

00:28.737 --> 00:31.865
and one of you lot let off one of those,
and then this plane goes down.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.743
- The plane's secure.
- Yeah. Right now, it is, yeah.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.662
We don't need any help.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.581
Well, right now you don't,
but what if it all goes wrong again?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.626
- Who the fuck are you?
- You went too early, didn't you?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.338
You was gonna do this later on
in the flight,

00:46.338 --> 00:48.882
then that man came rushing
into first class

00:48.882 --> 00:52.094
and he was worried and panicking
and then you gave him a green hat.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.012
The next thing you know,
it was all going off.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.974
That wasn't part of the plan, right?

00:56.974 --> 00:58.392
Go and get his passport.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.853
That can't have been part of the plan.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.022
Look,
if it's all going wrong in the first hour,

01:05.022 --> 01:07.067
imagine what could happen in the next six.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.779
Okay.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.969
He's coming down your side, Eddie.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.388
Hey, oi. What you doing?

01:37.723 --> 01:38.557
Shut up.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
- "Sam Nelson."
- Yeah.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.158
You think we're stupid...

01:58.577 --> 01:59.411
Sam Nelson?

01:59.411 --> 02:02.414
No, I don't. I don't think you're stupid.
I think you're very smart.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.833
But...

02:06.543 --> 02:08.169
Look, I think you get what I'm saying.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.969
Take him back to his seat.

02:40.911 --> 02:41.912
Open it.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.583
You wanna see them again, open it.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.641
Is that it?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.324
This is it. I go, and you follow. Yeah?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.036
No!

03:25.247 --> 03:26.874
Grab him, Eddie! Strangle him!

03:35.966 --> 03:37.009
Down!

03:38.510 --> 03:40.429
The gun! Kick the gun!

03:43.390 --> 03:44.766
Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.268
Face forward!

03:46.268 --> 03:47.686
Don't fucking move!

03:49.229 --> 03:51.440
The gun! Where's the gun?

04:20.219 --> 04:23.847
Like I said, I just wanna get home.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.161
<i>I'm gonna say it, yeah?</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:29.705
<i>Seven a.m. is way too early</i>

05:29.705 --> 05:33.083
<i>to call someone you haven't seen in about,
what, five years?</i>

05:33.083 --> 05:36.795
I know. I'm sorry. I need one favor.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.214
<i>I'm heading into my car
in about 30 seconds...</i>

05:39.214 --> 05:41.133
And listen, there might not be anything
in this, but--

05:41.133 --> 05:43.385
...which is my way of saying,
"Make it quick."

05:43.385 --> 05:44.511
Thanks.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.598
My girlfriend's ex is on a plane to London
from Dubai.

05:47.598 --> 05:51.768
He messaged her straight after takeoff
saying there was an incident on board.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.439
She messaged him back straightaway,
can't get through.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.107
<i>What are you asking me?</i>

05:57.107 --> 05:58.567
Well, to check if it's okay.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.569
Look, there must be someone you work with
who can--

06:00.569 --> 06:04.198
Yeah.
It's not a counterterrorism issue, Daniel.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.574
Well, it might be.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.785
And if it's not, I--
You know, maybe there's someone who--

06:08.785 --> 06:10.746
You know, who knows someone who--

06:11.413 --> 06:13.790
<i>Please, Zahra. I told her I'd try.</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:15.959
All right. An issue on board?

06:15.959 --> 06:17.211
An incident.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.798
Then he told her how much he loves her.
How he'll always love her.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.259
Right. And this is definitely her ex
we're talking about?

06:24.760 --> 06:27.638
<i>It's the way he said it.
He wouldn't have said it unless it--</i>

06:28.138 --> 06:30.641
He'd never have said it
like that unless it was serious.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.186
<i>Okay, what's the flight number?</i>

06:35.729 --> 06:37.981
Thanks. Genuinely.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.192
Especially after everything you
and I-- You know.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.444
Yeah, the flight number, Daniel.

06:43.445 --> 06:47.491
KA29. Kilo Alpha Two Nine.
Took off about an hour ago.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.535
All right, got it.

06:57.668 --> 07:01.213
Why are you doing this?
What do you guys want?

07:01.213 --> 07:02.256
Shut up.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.010
Ties.

07:16.979 --> 07:17.980
Ice.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.566
Sorry?

07:20.566 --> 07:21.984
You got any ice on the plane?

07:23.694 --> 07:24.695
Yeah.

07:42.087 --> 07:46.508
Whose idea was it to start all that shit?

07:53.265 --> 07:55.100
Mine. It was mine.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.945
Not a good one, mate.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.909
It's not for me.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.208
The guy that's in charge, what's his name?

08:19.208 --> 08:20.292
Stop chatting, mate.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.629
Sit down.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.761
No one's interested in your bullshit.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.609
<i>Don't make me come up there, mister.</i>

08:47.361 --> 08:50.113
All right, I'm starting to get angry now.
Come on.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.198
I'm coming.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.369
We're even later than yesterday.
And that was a record in itself.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.539
Wait. Velcro.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.874
- They're for P.E.
- Velcro.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.760
- Bobs.
- <i>Alice?</i>

09:11.760 --> 09:14.054
Yeah, hi. Yeah, I'm five minutes late.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.932
- <i>So not ten like yesterday?</i>
- No, five.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.142
<i>Okay,
and how long is five minutes these days?</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:22.271
Simon, if I say "five", I mean five.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.190
<i>Okay, well,
I'll just tell the plane to keep circling</i>

09:25.190 --> 09:27.276
<i>till you're ready to come to work,
shall I?</i>

09:27.943 --> 09:29.903
Look,
Bobby had his appendix out yesterday,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.238
which means he's off school today,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.907
which means I need
to find alternative childcare.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.617
And that's further away than his school.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.912
All of which means, Simon,
I'm going to be ten minutes late.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.415
- Fifteen minutes tops.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

09:43.792 --> 09:45.085
All right, now.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.045
Tune.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.532
<i>"This is your cabin crew speaking.</i>

10:16.825 --> 10:20.454
<i>We ask that you remain in your seats
with your seat belts fastened.</i>

10:21.622 --> 10:24.958
<i>Do only as instructed
by those now in charge of this aircraft.</i>

10:26.668 --> 10:29.505
The events of the past few minutes
will not be tolerated.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.968
Any further resistance
will result in a fatality.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.055
Take this as your final warning."

10:38.055 --> 10:39.640
Right, give me that.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.559
Now fuck off down the front.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.823
Hey. Get something for this.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.791
Checking for you now.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.920
Yeah. One second.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.299
Kingdom 2-9, what are the timings on that?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.885
Not due till 13:06.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.179
It's still a way out I'm afraid.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.014
Five hours till it hits our airspace.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.474
Can you contact the plane direct?

12:45.474 --> 12:47.935
<i>Well, I can,
but anyone can if the Wi-Fi's on.</i>

12:47.935 --> 12:49.520
For some reason, the Wi-Fi's down.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.104
<i>Or we could try ATC at--</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:52.314
- <i>Where did you say? Dubai?</i>
- Yeah.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.317
Doesn't really fall under our remit,
but there you go.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.277
Bear with me.

12:57.903 --> 13:01.114
Siobhan,
can you get me a number for Dubai ATC?

13:02.991 --> 13:06.620
<i>Control, this is BA9850
requesting clearance for take off.</i>

13:08.872 --> 13:11.959
Eight.
You've got an eight to go on a nine.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.169
Take a second look.

13:15.879 --> 13:16.755
I'm going home.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.549
Happy birthday!

13:18.549 --> 13:22.177
BA9850, you're clear to take off.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.555
Correct. Talked to the aircraft.

13:24.555 --> 13:27.641
Now everything is fine. False alarm.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.227
Was that about the Kingdom flight?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.438
Yes. British calling.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.565
What'd you say?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.443
I say everything is okay.
Just false alarm.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.906
No. Not here, my friend.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.248
The boy who cried wolf?

13:58.213 --> 14:01.758
Hey. You spoke to the pilot.
He said it was nothing.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.218
What if he's wrong?

14:03.218 --> 14:04.553
How could he be wrong?

14:04.553 --> 14:05.679
What if he's lying?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.556
Why would he lie?

14:08.182 --> 14:10.058
Maybe someone was making him lie.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.019
Maybe he was threatened.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.229
But his voice.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.482
He was not frightened.
He sounded very calm and relaxed.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.901
That's how they sound.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.653
- Pilots?
- British people. Zero emotion.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.155
Tells us nothing.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.123
<i>You need to get him out of there.</i>

14:33.707 --> 14:37.961
Look, you've got everyone
where you want them except for him.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.839
He doesn't have to be in there anyway.

14:41.465 --> 14:45.010
Everyone knows that pilots
just do the takeoffs and the landings.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.012
The rest is on autopilot.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.265
So?

14:52.309 --> 14:53.852
So he could be taking us anywhere.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.151
<i>What have you got for me, Heidi?</i>

15:01.652 --> 15:03.320
<i>Flight Path Control spoke with Dubai.</i>

15:03.320 --> 15:06.198
<i>They'd already contacted the pilot.
It's confirmed as a false alarm.</i>

15:06.198 --> 15:07.658
Shit.

15:09.368 --> 15:10.452
Isn't that good?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.830
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.750
<i>You're just having a bad morning.</i>

15:16.750 --> 15:19.628
I'm having the world's worst journey,
that's what I'm having.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.571
Right. I want it on autopilot.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.155
It is.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.032
Show me.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.247
Yeah, show me, though. Explain it.

15:56.832 --> 15:59.418
Okay. Well, if I press autopilot there,

15:59.418 --> 16:02.880
I get a message on my flight screen here
that shows you there,

16:02.880 --> 16:07.342
if you look, the autopilot, AP1,
is engaged.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.429
And the program destinations are here.

16:11.054 --> 16:17.144
That's Heathrow, EGLL,
at a bearing of 320 degrees.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.730
How do I know that?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.024
About the degrees?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.483
That it's London.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.236
Well, it's there. EGLL, that's the code.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.905
Europe, Great Britain, London.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.783
So you don't have to touch anything now?

16:32.367 --> 16:36.830
No. Not until an hour before Heathrow.

16:54.932 --> 16:55.766
Peace be upon you.

16:55.766 --> 16:56.725
And also upon you.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.435
- You're in charge here, yes?
- Yes.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.937
I work in ATC.

16:59.937 --> 17:02.231
We think there might be a problem
with one of the aircraft

17:02.231 --> 17:04.316
that took off this morning.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.569
Planes are not my department.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.737
I get that. I realize that.

17:08.737 --> 17:09.655
The cameras.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.782
Can I see the footage?

17:14.076 --> 17:16.662
Can I ask to see the footage?

17:17.371 --> 17:19.540
You can ask. You can always ask.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.375
Okay.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.667
Thank you.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.758
Take your seat belt off. Belt off.

17:30.926 --> 17:31.885
Move.

17:35.347 --> 17:38.392
Let go of my arm. Stop it.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.144
You're hurting my arm.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.813
My arm!

17:42.813 --> 17:46.108
Hey! She's doing what you want.

17:55.868 --> 17:56.869
Go on.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.038
Ask her if it was a gun.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.832
Ask if it was a gun.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.048
Sit there.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.300
What's she done?

18:13.343 --> 18:14.344
She stays here.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.395
You all right, pet? What's happening?

18:23.395 --> 18:24.479
What's happening?

18:24.479 --> 18:27.024
There's a man up there
who's gone over to their side.

18:27.691 --> 18:30.569
He's just betrayed us all to help himself.
That's what's happening.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.488
I don't understand.

18:46.418 --> 18:49.671
First one, sit there. Just here.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.800
Keep your voice down.

19:02.684 --> 19:06.396
She's in a really bad way.
I need to get some more supplies to her.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.731
- She's fine.
- She's not.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.274
She's bleeding really badly.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.235
If I could just get to the back
of the plane.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.861
No, it's not happening.

19:15.531 --> 19:16.532
Sit.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.827
Hello? Sit down.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.830
Sit.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.614
<i>Shiver me timbers.</i>

20:02.536 --> 20:03.912
<i>Seriously?</i>

20:03.912 --> 20:06.164
You're just going out
like nothing's happened?

20:06.164 --> 20:07.749
Well, what would he want us to do?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.460
- He'd tell us not to worry.
- You don't know that.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.088
- And to get on with our day.
- You don't know that, though.

20:13.088 --> 20:15.716
This is an important day for me, Kai.

20:25.893 --> 20:29.313
If anything changes, we'll call.

20:30.564 --> 20:31.690
Or text.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.611
I'm here. Okay?

20:41.909 --> 20:42.951
I'll leave my phone on.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.663
When has your phone ever been off?

20:59.635 --> 21:00.511
And?

21:00.511 --> 21:03.722
<i>They spoke to the airport, to Dubai.
It's a false alarm.</i>

21:03.722 --> 21:04.932
Are you sure?

21:04.932 --> 21:06.642
<i>All a misunderstanding.</i>

21:09.144 --> 21:09.978
<i>Marsha.</i>

21:10.896 --> 21:11.897
See?

21:12.481 --> 21:14.942
This is the problem.
This is the man I'm dealing with.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.777
- <i>Marsha--</i>
- No, this is what Sam's like.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.238
This is what he will always be like.

21:19.238 --> 21:20.447
<i>The main thing is,</i>

21:20.447 --> 21:23.075
<i>whatever we thought
was happening on that plane, he's okay.</i>

21:23.825 --> 21:25.619
<i>Sam is okay.</i>

21:27.454 --> 21:28.622
Thank you.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.846
So, Dad's okay?

21:44.972 --> 21:46.515
A gun went off, that's all I heard.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.559
- You heard the gun?
- No, I heard that's what happened.

21:48.559 --> 21:54.898
A gun went off in business, there was
a fight, two guys tried to take them on.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.733
That's what people were saying.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.402
You saw 'em then? These blokes?

21:59.152 --> 22:02.698
Only when they brought me back here.
They were tied up.

22:02.698 --> 22:06.368
That's what they must have meant by
"will not be tolerated."

22:06.368 --> 22:09.830
It's why they're doing this in
the first place. That's what I wanna know.

22:09.830 --> 22:13.917
So, what did you do then?
Come on, you must have done something.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.252
Don't talk to her like that.

22:15.252 --> 22:18.046
Well, think about it.
They've not put her here for no reason.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.176
Turn round.

22:23.969 --> 22:26.972
You. Face forward.

22:28.182 --> 22:31.101
You. Shut up.

22:33.729 --> 22:35.647
Hey, it's gonna be all right, okay?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.524
What the fuck did I just say?

23:22.694 --> 23:28.617
Passengers of KA29 will be in this area.
Mixed in with other flights.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.371
It's all pretty normal.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.834
So you saw nothing suspicious?

23:36.834 --> 23:38.293
Today? No.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.673
Security's tight here. We're good.

23:43.924 --> 23:44.925
See?

23:45.467 --> 23:46.969
I recognize her.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.266
Neela. That's her name.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.103
Took my daughter to her kid's party.

23:56.103 --> 23:57.396
Neela, yeah.

23:58.021 --> 24:01.567
Last week, she stopped a man
from bringing on a starter pistol.

24:02.192 --> 24:05.863
As in, you know, a gun to start a race.

24:06.947 --> 24:07.948
Neela's the best.

24:07.948 --> 24:10.617
If there's any kind
of problem, she'll spot it.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.204
Fast-forward again.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.056
That's it? She went home?

24:34.308 --> 24:36.059
Maybe it was the end of her shift.

24:37.853 --> 24:41.148
Maybe. Did anyone check?

25:19.603 --> 25:20.437
You all right?

25:27.778 --> 25:29.279
Seat belt.

25:52.094 --> 25:53.095
Got everything?

25:53.762 --> 25:56.890
Got your water? Got your snack?
Got your reading diary?

25:58.267 --> 26:00.811
Yeah? Right, go on in. In you go. In.

26:01.353 --> 26:02.396
You said it before.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.941
- Said what before?
- That I had my appendix out.

26:06.733 --> 26:07.734
Did I?

26:08.360 --> 26:09.778
You said that last term.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.239
And you can only have your appendix
out once, let's face it.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.783
So if somebody says that twice...

26:14.783 --> 26:19.162
Something smells dodgy. Yes.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.289
What are you gonna do?

26:20.289 --> 26:23.333
I'm gonna hope that my boss
isn't as clever as you. Now go in, please.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.711
You're late. In.

26:26.712 --> 26:28.714
- Love you. Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, love you!

26:36.680 --> 26:39.558
A table for two at the Plaza.

26:39.975 --> 26:42.311
That is what I want for my birthday.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.314
I want to buy you lobster. Okay?

26:46.190 --> 26:47.608
<i>Okay.</i>

26:47.608 --> 26:49.484
<i>So, let's do it properly.</i>

26:49.484 --> 26:51.195
<i>Starters... All the seafood...</i>

26:52.196 --> 26:54.448
<i>A proper babysitter...</i>

26:54.448 --> 26:57.409
Fatima. I'll call you back.

26:58.535 --> 26:59.536
Abdullah.

26:59.536 --> 27:02.497
<i>It's Natalia. Airport security.</i>

27:03.040 --> 27:07.836
<i>Your friend Neela, you were right,
she left early. She said she was sick.</i>

27:08.462 --> 27:10.255
She didn't seem very sick.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.716
<i>Well, that's what she said, apparently.</i>

27:13.258 --> 27:14.384
Okay. Thank you.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.981
My girlfriend's very grateful.

28:09.565 --> 28:10.774
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

28:10.774 --> 28:14.444
She's also angry.
You know? Angry that her ex--

28:14.444 --> 28:17.614
her ex made her think that he was
in danger when he obviously wasn't.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.032
Okay. Again, yeah,

28:19.032 --> 28:22.369
I get why you might call me about all
the counterterrorism stuff, but--

28:22.369 --> 28:24.329
No, this isn't a work call.

28:24.329 --> 28:26.498
<i>Yeah, this is getting a bit strange now.</i>

28:27.416 --> 28:29.710
Well, I just wanna know what you think.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.753
You think that--

28:31.753 --> 28:34.006
<i>I know it's a weird call to make, I do.</i>

28:34.006 --> 28:36.091
You think that for someone
who's meant to--

28:36.592 --> 28:38.385
You think that for someone
who's meant to have moved on,

28:38.385 --> 28:40.804
she cares too much about what
this guy says and does?

28:42.139 --> 28:43.098
Yeah, so--

28:44.975 --> 28:47.895
So, when I asked you
if this ex really is an ex...

28:48.478 --> 28:50.689
Hey, when you said, you know--

28:50.689 --> 28:54.610
Or when we agreed
that it was over between us, it was over.

28:55.777 --> 28:59.615
<i>We never spoke about it, you
never called me, you know. That was it.</i>

29:02.326 --> 29:05.120
- Are you still there?
- Yes. Look--

29:05.120 --> 29:06.705
Look, Daniel, if it was me, okay,

29:06.705 --> 29:08.290
- and she's worth fighting for...
- <i>She is.</i>

29:08.290 --> 29:10.292
...then she can care about
this guy all she wants,

29:10.292 --> 29:12.794
'cause I'm just gonna make sure that
she cares about me more.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.172
<i>Commit, Dan, or things move on.</i>

29:15.839 --> 29:17.799
All right, let 'em through.

29:17.799 --> 29:21.220
Yeah, and maybe don't call me
about this kinda thing again, yeah?

29:22.763 --> 29:23.764
<i>Sorry.</i>

29:24.431 --> 29:25.474
It's all right.

29:39.738 --> 29:43.283
<i>Kingdom 2-9,
this is Baghdad control, how do you read?</i>

29:49.331 --> 29:53.210
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is Baghdad control,
how do you read?</i>

30:00.175 --> 30:02.553
<i>Kingdom 2-9, control, how do you read?</i>

30:03.136 --> 30:05.556
Got a message coming through in there.
Have a listen.

30:08.058 --> 30:11.687
<i>Kingdom 2-9,
this is Baghdad control, how do you read?</i>

30:12.729 --> 30:14.022
We need to answer that.

30:16.608 --> 30:19.236
If it's air traffic control,
we need to answer that now.

30:19.236 --> 30:21.947
- Sit down.
- He needs to answer that. Him.

30:22.948 --> 30:24.867
Sit the fuck down!

30:25.534 --> 30:28.036
This absolutely needs to happen.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.081
- Is he right? Is he?
- No, he's lying.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.499
How do you know?

30:32.499 --> 30:34.793
- Listen to what I'm saying.
- How do you know?

30:34.793 --> 30:36.962
He wants the ground
to know something's wrong

30:36.962 --> 30:39.464
because he thinks this is going to stop,

30:39.464 --> 30:41.717
but it's actually going
to make it a lot worse.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.719
I won't tell you again, mate. Sit down.

30:44.469 --> 30:48.515
<i>Kingdom 2-9 on airway Lima 602,</i>

30:48.515 --> 30:52.477
<i>please call Baghdad control
on 123 decimal 52.</i>

30:52.477 --> 30:53.562
Get her.

30:57.733 --> 30:59.276
You can answer that, can't ya?

31:02.237 --> 31:05.157
They won't speak to her.
They'll need to speak to the captain.

31:05.157 --> 31:06.575
Sit the fuck down!

31:06.575 --> 31:08.285
Can I-- Please, mate? Please?

31:08.285 --> 31:10.329
Listen, if they think something's wrong,

31:10.329 --> 31:12.456
they'll scramble the jets,
and if they do that...

31:14.499 --> 31:15.542
they'll shoot us down.

31:22.341 --> 31:23.550
<i>Kingdom 2-9.</i>

31:24.843 --> 31:28.388
<i>Urgent. This is Baghdad control.
We need identification.</i>

31:30.390 --> 31:32.309
Baghdad, this is Kingdom 2-9.

31:33.101 --> 31:35.103
<i>We tried five times to identify.</i>

31:36.188 --> 31:37.481
Apologies, Baghdad. We're here.

31:38.524 --> 31:40.234
<i>I'm speaking to the captain?</i>

31:44.821 --> 31:46.657
<i>Is this the captain speaking?</i>

31:47.991 --> 31:49.368
Correct.

31:49.368 --> 31:51.870
- <i>You are the captain?</i>
- <i>Correct.</i>

31:52.496 --> 31:54.414
You are Robin Allen?

31:59.461 --> 32:01.463
<i>Captain is Robin Allen?</i>

32:01.463 --> 32:04.258
He wants the ground to know
that something's wrong

32:04.258 --> 32:07.219
because he thinks this is gonna stop.
Can you tell him, please?

32:07.219 --> 32:09.805
<i>I must speak to Captain Allen.</i>

32:09.805 --> 32:11.348
He's away from the cockpit.

32:11.348 --> 32:15.143
- Captain is away from the cockpit?
- <i>That is correct.</i>

32:15.143 --> 32:17.062
So, why say you are the captain?

32:21.692 --> 32:26.530
I speak to Robin Allen right now.
For security purposes, now.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.242
What you've gotta do is get in the cockpit

32:30.242 --> 32:32.244
and tell them everything is all right,
you hear me?

32:32.244 --> 32:35.122
If you put me in that cockpit,
it's only gonna make matters worse

32:35.122 --> 32:37.332
- than they are now. Listen to me...
- Just take your hand off the belt.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.543
- ...I'm not getting out of this seat.
- Just do what he says.

32:39.543 --> 32:41.879
- Can you help?
- You cannot make me.

32:41.879 --> 32:43.130
Just grab the belt.

32:44.089 --> 32:45.924
Get back in your seat. There's no point.

32:45.924 --> 32:47.593
We're all gonna fucking die
unless you go--

32:47.593 --> 32:52.806
I'm not moving!
Get your hands off me, get off!

32:52.806 --> 32:54.725
Get her, for fuck's sake. Bring her here.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.687
Fuck. Come here.

32:58.687 --> 32:59.938
Jesus Christ.

32:59.938 --> 33:01.899
- Right, here.
- Hey!

33:01.899 --> 33:05.152
Look. Here, all right?
Now don't make them do this.

33:06.695 --> 33:10.115
All right?
Don't make us make them do this.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.661
All right. I'm going.

33:15.621 --> 33:16.455
All right.

33:16.455 --> 33:17.539
Okay.

33:35.015 --> 33:37.518
<i>Baghdad control, this is Kingdom 2-9,</i>

33:37.518 --> 33:39.728
<i>Captain Robin Allen speaking.
Good morning.</i>

33:41.021 --> 33:45.651
Pilot Allen, please confirm
date of birth, security question.

33:46.693 --> 33:49.446
<i>Twenty-second, the second, 1970.</i>

33:49.446 --> 33:53.408
Pilot Allen, please confirm you are safe
and not in need of assistance.

33:53.408 --> 33:55.285
All safe and well, thank you Baghdad.

33:55.285 --> 33:56.453
He went to the toilet.

33:59.414 --> 34:03.001
I just nipped out
to the bathroom for a minute.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.546
But where was the copilot?

34:10.467 --> 34:12.553
We've been having a lot of radio problems

34:12.553 --> 34:15.681
so we're not exactly
covering ourselves in glory this morning.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.407
<i>Kingdom 2-9.</i>

34:33.407 --> 34:38.161
<i>Please confirm final destination
and heading. Security verified.</i>

34:39.204 --> 34:44.251
Okay, we are squawking 4625
maintaining a course for London, Heathrow.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.135
Once he's done, take him back to his seat.

34:56.722 --> 35:00.017
So, you've hijacked a plane,
and no one knows about it.

35:03.854 --> 35:09.902
Down there,
not one person knows a thing about this.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.655
That represents success.

35:21.622 --> 35:22.623
Come on.

35:41.183 --> 35:42.309
Morning.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.405
What happened to five minutes
being five minutes?

36:06.750 --> 36:08.585
<i>Lufthansa, 958, turn right.</i>

36:08.585 --> 36:12.297
<i>Heading 329.
Descend and maintain flight levels 30.</i>

36:18.136 --> 36:19.721
What's going on with this Lufthansa?

36:19.721 --> 36:24.017
Delayed. I looked after your KLM.
Michael covered your Swiss Air.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.352
Thank you, Michael.

36:25.853 --> 36:27.855
You nearly had a live one and all.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.273
That Kingdom at the bottom.

36:29.857 --> 36:32.526
Counterterrorism called.
Suspected incident on board.

36:33.110 --> 36:35.946
All sorted now, though.
Pilot said it was a false alarm.

36:39.408 --> 36:40.409
How does that work?

36:41.618 --> 36:43.787
- Sorry?
- A false alarm, how does that work?

36:45.163 --> 36:49.626
Simon got a call, rang Dubai,
Dubai said it was old news. False alarm.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.670
- Simon?
- Why get involved?

36:53.088 --> 36:54.923
- Simon?
- You're in enough trouble as it is.

36:55.424 --> 36:58.343
Kingdom 2-9?
You get a call about an incident?

36:58.927 --> 37:00.804
- Suspected.
- Suspected?

37:00.804 --> 37:02.848
You ring Dubai and Dubai say what exactly?

37:02.848 --> 37:04.308
- False alarm.
- See?

37:04.308 --> 37:06.476
- So, there were two calls?
- Sorry?

37:06.476 --> 37:09.062
- Here we go.
- Well, you get a call, you call Dubai,

37:09.062 --> 37:12.107
Dubai had already had
a call earlier. It was already sorted.

37:12.691 --> 37:13.817
And what's wrong with that?

37:13.817 --> 37:15.360
Nothing, absolutely nothi--

37:15.360 --> 37:17.321
I mean, that's really weird,
don't you think?

37:19.031 --> 37:21.283
Somebody on board calls the UK,

37:21.283 --> 37:25.204
manages to get a message to us
via Counter Terrorism of all people?

37:26.079 --> 37:29.041
But the passenger who's done that,
who's gone to all that trouble,

37:29.041 --> 37:30.501
they've also got it wrong?

37:31.001 --> 37:32.085
Maybe they dealt with it.

37:34.087 --> 37:36.256
Then why didn't the second caller
say that too?

37:36.840 --> 37:41.637
If it was all fixed, why didn't
the second caller send any more messages?

37:41.637 --> 37:43.847
Well, because for some reason
the Wi-Fi was down.

37:44.348 --> 37:46.558
Because for some reason
the Wi-Fi was down?

37:47.601 --> 37:48.810
Okay. Yeah.

37:53.899 --> 37:55.484
Something smells dodgy.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.166
<i>Hello, this is Senil.</i>

38:11.166 --> 38:13.335
<i>Please leave your number
and I will call you back.</i>

38:20.008 --> 38:22.302
Yeah,
no, we have double-checked with Dubai,

38:22.302 --> 38:25.389
- now we're just double-checking with you.
- Ask if they can share their screen.

38:25.389 --> 38:28.725
Kingdom 2-9 was not responding.
They would not identify.

38:29.518 --> 38:30.769
We try many times.

38:30.769 --> 38:34.022
- Ask them to share their screens.
- Okay, you need to share your screen now.

38:37.901 --> 38:40.320
Okay. So, that's what Baghdad are seeing.

38:40.904 --> 38:43.740
That's Kingdom 2-9's flight path
viewed in isolation.

38:44.449 --> 38:46.326
That's normal, to go that way?

38:46.326 --> 38:48.954
Is that the standard route?
Yeah, that's fine, apparently,

38:48.954 --> 38:50.747
and that route would have been
uploaded before takeoff.

38:50.747 --> 38:51.748
And the other line?

38:52.249 --> 38:53.584
Well, you can see the route there.

38:53.584 --> 38:56.795
But the other line.
Ask him to go closer, please.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.463
Can you zoom in for us, please, Jalal?

39:00.340 --> 39:01.341
Yeah. There.

39:02.426 --> 39:03.427
Behind the plane.

39:08.807 --> 39:09.975
That's a deviation, no?

39:11.977 --> 39:12.978
Michael?

39:37.252 --> 39:40.964
It's a message. That's the plane
trying to tell you something.

39:40.964 --> 39:42.049
Yes, I agree.

39:42.049 --> 39:43.133
I don't get it.

39:45.010 --> 39:47.638
Before 9/11,
planes often veered off course.

39:48.347 --> 39:49.973
Now it's tightly monitored.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.351
If anything,
it's a way to signal there's a problem.

39:52.351 --> 39:54.686
Yes, if you're not able
to signal it verbally.

39:54.686 --> 39:57.231
Are you sure that's not just
the weather blowing it off course?

39:58.440 --> 39:59.566
It's too straight a line.

40:00.192 --> 40:04.238
It's a three degree shift.
It's meant to be at 320 degrees

40:04.238 --> 40:06.532
but someone's changed it to 323.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.285
So, something has happened to Kingdom 2-9...

40:12.371 --> 40:14.164
and someone is calling for help.

41:14.266 --> 41:18.061
Excuse me, I'm looking for Neela.

41:20.939 --> 41:23.400
- Is she here?
- They're all upstairs.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.320
Who are you?

41:27.237 --> 41:28.363
We're the cleaners, pal.

41:29.198 --> 41:31.116
Professional cleaners.

41:32.576 --> 41:36.079
They're moving out next week. You want me
to go up and tell them you're here?

41:36.079 --> 41:39.583
No. Thank you. I will go.

41:42.628 --> 41:43.629
Neela!

41:50.385 --> 41:51.595
That's it, pal.

41:56.016 --> 41:57.351
All the way in the back there.

41:59.144 --> 42:00.145
Neela?

42:16.703 --> 42:17.704
Neela?

42:45.440 --> 42:48.735
Do me a favor.
Step back into the bathroom for me.

42:51.405 --> 42:52.906
The bathroom's easier to clean.
