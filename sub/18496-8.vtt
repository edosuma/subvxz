00:17.272 --> 00:19.400
El Gato!

00:36.636 --> 00:39.529
<b>4x08 - Titan Up</b>

00:59.022 --> 01:01.984
I had too much gruel.

01:02.067 --> 01:04.444
I'm never eating gruel again.

01:04.903 --> 01:06.280
Ooh, gruel!

01:12.035 --> 01:15.414
Crown of Souls. Hmm.

01:19.626 --> 01:22.337
The weather outside! It is...

01:29.511 --> 01:32.014
Have you learned anything
about the Crown of Souls?

01:32.097 --> 01:35.392
It is nearly Walcrusmurdismack...
Wolfpag...

01:35.851 --> 01:36.894
Oh. Come on.

01:37.477 --> 01:39.563
- Walpurgisnacht.
- Yes!

01:39.646 --> 01:44.067
It is nearly that day.
And with it comes the Bloodwolf.

01:44.151 --> 01:47.237
We've been at it all morning
with that book.

01:47.321 --> 01:49.865
It says here that the Crown of Souls

01:49.948 --> 01:53.202
must be used by the One
from the Great Prophecy...

01:53.285 --> 01:56.872
- Who is me.
- ...in conjunction with something called:

01:56.955 --> 02:00.083
"The Obelisk of Night"!

02:00.167 --> 02:01.835
The Obelisk of Night?

02:05.255 --> 02:06.298
What is obelisk?

02:06.882 --> 02:07.716
Hmm.

02:08.258 --> 02:12.471
"An obelisk is tall, not fat,
and wears a pyramid for a hat."

02:14.139 --> 02:16.558
I'd like to see that other book
rhyme that well.

02:16.642 --> 02:20.479
That is it! It is settled.
I will find this Obelisk of Night.

02:20.562 --> 02:21.897
It will be nothing for one

02:21.980 --> 02:24.775
with such finely-honed
tracking skills as...

02:42.876 --> 02:47.089
Did you know that weird weather
means the sky gods are fighting?

02:47.172 --> 02:49.716
Oh, the innocent beliefs of a child.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.344
Now...
...repeat after me.

02:52.427 --> 02:55.305
Weather has nothing to do
with the sky gods.

02:55.889 --> 02:58.725
"Weather has nothing to do with..."

03:06.733 --> 03:08.902
Sky gods!

03:13.448 --> 03:16.326
Aerial villain! Why have you fallen here?

03:23.125 --> 03:24.543
Oh. I come in peace!

03:24.626 --> 03:27.254
Please don't hurt me,
oh, Great One in Boots!

03:27.337 --> 03:29.423
Oh!

03:30.132 --> 03:31.091
Eh, what now?

03:32.467 --> 03:36.597
I know you have beaten Taranis,
who is me, a thousand times before,

03:36.680 --> 03:38.849
but I beg you to put aside
your mighty fists

03:38.932 --> 03:41.977
and help me to defeat
the most powerful of all the gods,

03:42.060 --> 03:46.356
Toutatis the All-Father, who has exiled me
from our godly realm!

03:47.816 --> 03:48.650
Um...

03:48.942 --> 03:51.778
okay...?

03:51.862 --> 03:55.741
Taranis, who is still me,
is so glad you have agreed to help.

03:55.824 --> 03:57.492
Toutatis has gone mad!

03:57.576 --> 04:00.537
He plans to extinguish all mortals!

04:01.246 --> 04:02.122
All mortals?

04:02.706 --> 04:03.874
All mortals.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.459
But that would be...

04:05.709 --> 04:07.210
Eh, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

04:07.294 --> 04:08.629
Everyone in the world!

04:08.712 --> 04:11.006
Yes. Toutatis has gone mad with power.

04:11.089 --> 04:12.799
He must be stopped!

04:13.675 --> 04:15.010
Look!

04:15.093 --> 04:17.137
It is the small people and barn animals.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.640
You're still small and animals.

04:20.307 --> 04:22.476
You, um, know each other?

04:22.559 --> 04:26.104
Okay, long story short,
we met this Taranis guy before.

04:26.188 --> 04:28.565
He's a god of thunder
who could destroy us all.

04:29.733 --> 04:34.196
Did you know that Cleevil told him
you defeated him a thousand times?

04:34.279 --> 04:37.366
And we kind of told him you had,
like, crazy powers.

04:37.449 --> 04:39.326
Um, such as...

04:39.826 --> 04:40.911
Nose fire!

04:41.953 --> 04:43.580
 Fairy wings!

04:44.081 --> 04:44.998
 Fairy breath!

04:47.084 --> 04:48.502
Oh, and we told him
that you and me

04:48.585 --> 04:51.254
can do this thing called
"The Super Friendship High Five!"

04:55.801 --> 04:56.635
Eh?

04:58.053 --> 04:59.346
No time for high fives.

04:59.930 --> 05:00.764
Aww.

05:02.724 --> 05:05.060
Yes. Hi, uh, hello.

05:05.143 --> 05:08.230
It would seem that these children
have told you lies about me.

05:12.734 --> 05:16.905
I hope you are not going to tell me
the tales of your powers are false!

05:16.988 --> 05:19.157
That would be very disappointing!

05:19.658 --> 05:24.621
I would have to punish this town
with fiery fires of destruction!

05:24.705 --> 05:28.542
Uh, of course not.
I was going to tell you...

05:29.042 --> 05:31.294
I am even more powerful than they said.

05:33.422 --> 05:37.509
All hail Puss in Boots,
the mightiest god-cat who ever lived!

05:37.592 --> 05:40.595
 "God-cat."
It is good to be admired.

05:40.679 --> 05:43.390
Will you join me, God-Cat,

05:43.473 --> 05:46.476
in stopping Toutatis and saving the world?

05:47.644 --> 05:48.687
Yes!

05:48.770 --> 05:52.732
I hereby pledge you my fairy wings
and nose fire and whatever!

05:52.816 --> 05:53.692
Whoa!

05:54.568 --> 05:57.237
Puss, what are you doing?
You don't have those things.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.573
Huzzah! This is like...

05:59.656 --> 06:01.741
If I tell him that, he will destroy us!

06:01.825 --> 06:04.536
And if we don't stop this Toutatis,
he will destroy us!

06:04.619 --> 06:06.621
Yay! Yes! Yes! Yes!

06:06.705 --> 06:09.750
Also, I cannot say no to someone
who calls me a god-cat.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.669
In fact, I may ask that
all of you begin calling me that.

06:14.004 --> 06:15.005
Please don't.

06:15.088 --> 06:17.174
Come, my sizable friend!

06:17.257 --> 06:18.967
Let us save the world!

06:19.050 --> 06:22.262
Huzzah! Taranis is grateful for your help.

06:22.721 --> 06:25.432
Oh, you're a way better god than me.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.768
All I can do is fly
with the power of my mighty wheel.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.522
Ooh, ooh. Can I see your
terrifying nose fire?

06:32.606 --> 06:34.649
Please, please, pretty please?

06:34.733 --> 06:36.485
Um, uh...

06:36.568 --> 06:38.987
I am just getting over a cold, so...

06:40.614 --> 06:43.450
Then what powers can you show me?

06:45.202 --> 06:46.036
Uh...

06:49.247 --> 06:50.248
Behold!

06:50.332 --> 06:52.501
The magical backwards-forwards walk!

06:55.086 --> 06:57.047
The spinning through the air thing!

06:59.549 --> 07:00.425
Hygiene.

07:00.509 --> 07:02.260
My lips are not moving.

07:02.969 --> 07:03.929
Not one bit.

07:04.930 --> 07:06.181
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

07:06.264 --> 07:08.808
The big eyes.

07:08.892 --> 07:09.768
Uh, uh, uh?

07:09.851 --> 07:11.269
This other thing.

07:11.353 --> 07:12.312
Huh-huh.

07:12.395 --> 07:13.271
Grand handstand.

07:13.355 --> 07:14.314
Master of disguise.

07:14.397 --> 07:15.482
Swimming.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.108
I make a good sandwich. Dead eyes.

07:17.192 --> 07:19.069
- The great ball balance.
- Enough!

07:40.257 --> 07:42.467
Whoa!

07:47.764 --> 07:49.516
Amazing! Now, come.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.185
Let us travel to the Realm of the Gods
and give Toutatis

07:52.269 --> 07:53.895
a taste of your powers!

07:55.313 --> 07:56.940
Do you wanna fly or should I?

07:57.023 --> 07:59.109
Eh, please, be my guest.

08:03.697 --> 08:06.449
Did you know that
this is not going to end well?

08:07.075 --> 08:09.244
Yes, Vina. I did know that.

08:22.716 --> 08:25.594
♪ No one can beat the All-Father ♪

08:25.677 --> 08:30.307
♪ It can't be done, so don't bother!
Yeah! ♪

08:31.057 --> 08:32.058
Toutatis!

08:33.058 --> 08:34.269
I have returned!

08:34.936 --> 08:37.230
Ha! Back for more, eh?

08:39.774 --> 08:41.735
Okay, do your thing.

08:46.948 --> 08:50.744
Um, yes, hi, hello.
Puss in Boots.

08:51.244 --> 08:55.624
I was hoping we could discuss this whole
"destroying all mortals" plan of yours?

08:55.707 --> 08:58.126
Did you say "Puss in Boots"?

08:58.209 --> 08:59.711
The Puss in Boots?

09:00.295 --> 09:02.547
Did I? Maybe. Uh, who is asking?

09:10.388 --> 09:14.100
You're that all-powerful bloke in shoes
Taranis keeps going on about.

09:14.601 --> 09:17.103
Yes, yes. It is I.

09:17.187 --> 09:20.982
All-powerful, all-knowing, all-purring.

09:21.816 --> 09:23.568
I've heard tales of you.

09:24.194 --> 09:27.155
Tales of nose fire and, uh...

09:27.530 --> 09:29.574
- What was it?
- Fairy breath!

09:30.116 --> 09:33.453
Right, yeah, that. Go on, show us, then.

09:33.536 --> 09:35.330
Show us something big.

09:35.413 --> 09:38.541
Uh, my nose is a-a little dry right now.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.877
I think it is the elevation.

09:42.212 --> 09:45.507
Aw, man, that's so disappointing.

09:45.590 --> 09:48.468
I wanted to see it before I destroyed you!

09:48.551 --> 09:50.345
Uh, maybe I could try harder?

09:55.016 --> 09:56.851
For my next number,

09:56.935 --> 09:59.187
I'd like to play an old favorite.

09:59.270 --> 10:00.647
It's called...

10:00.730 --> 10:04.150
"Gonna destroy you, mate."

10:14.452 --> 10:15.328
Ha!

10:16.705 --> 10:17.664
Ah, come on!

10:19.582 --> 10:22.794
Now would be the time to unleash
all of your godly powers.

10:22.877 --> 10:24.963
I am working on it! En garde!

10:27.757 --> 10:29.509
Nice try, kitty cat,

10:29.592 --> 10:32.554
but no mortal is a match for me.

10:32.637 --> 10:35.390
Once my axe is fully charged
with lightning,

10:35.473 --> 10:38.768
I'll use it to destroy
every last mortal on Earth.

10:38.852 --> 10:41.646
And there's nothing you can do about it!

10:58.246 --> 10:59.080
Uh...

10:59.831 --> 11:01.916
I think we are going to need
a better plan.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.669
What happened up there?
The weather was going crazy!

11:04.753 --> 11:07.672
Yeah! A weather vane flew off the roof
and hit me in the head.

11:07.756 --> 11:10.300
I thought I was a kangaroo
for a while.

11:13.344 --> 11:17.098
Our sky adventure went... somewhat poorly.

11:17.265 --> 11:18.308
Now, think.

11:18.391 --> 11:21.102
There must be something
we can do to stop Toutatis!

11:21.186 --> 11:23.271
I wish I could think better.

11:23.354 --> 11:27.859
All I can do is dumb thunder stuff
by summoning the power of my great wheel.

11:30.612 --> 11:31.571
That is it!

11:31.654 --> 11:33.782
If the source of your power is your wheel,

11:33.865 --> 11:36.701
then the source of Toutatis' power
must be his axe.

11:36.785 --> 11:38.745
Yay! You did...

11:39.120 --> 11:41.414
- Too soon?
- If we destroy his axe,

11:41.498 --> 11:45.585
we take away his power and save ourselves
and all of the other mortals on Earth.

11:47.253 --> 11:48.254
Now, Toby!

11:49.088 --> 11:51.257
Yay! You did it!

11:51.341 --> 11:54.177
Boingy, boingy, boingy,
boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy...

11:58.973 --> 12:00.433
"Toutatis rules.

12:00.975 --> 12:02.727
Toutatis is great.

12:03.436 --> 12:06.564
Toutatis will make you hyperventilate."

12:06.648 --> 12:08.233
No. "Exfoliate"?

12:08.316 --> 12:10.819
Toutatis! It is I, Taranis!

12:13.154 --> 12:16.366
Oi, mate. Don't you think
this tune is getting a little old?

12:16.449 --> 12:20.495
The only tune here is the sound
of me punch-fighting with my fists!

12:20.578 --> 12:23.164
Ah, your mouth-words are boring!

13:01.744 --> 13:03.413
Whee! Whee!

13:03.496 --> 13:04.414
Whee!

13:05.915 --> 13:07.292
Ooh! What?

13:07.375 --> 13:10.044
No, you guys!
Natural disasters are not fun!

13:10.128 --> 13:12.297
They're a little fun.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.841
See! Ow! Fun! Ow. Ow.

13:28.313 --> 13:29.981
Steal the axe. Save the world.

13:37.030 --> 13:38.323
Ha-ha! Toutatis!

13:38.406 --> 13:41.367
Oi! Cat in shoes!

13:41.451 --> 13:44.454
What you doin' with me axe?

13:52.462 --> 13:56.674
No matter. I have your magical axe,
and without it, you are rendered helpless.

13:56.758 --> 13:57.592
Ha-ha!

13:58.259 --> 13:59.093
Nope.

14:04.641 --> 14:07.685
But you said you were waiting
for your axe to charge with lightning

14:07.769 --> 14:09.145
before destroying all mortals.

14:09.229 --> 14:12.899
I don't need it, mate.
It just woulda looked cooler.

14:13.524 --> 14:14.442
Ah.

14:14.692 --> 14:17.695
I assumed that since Taranis' wheel
is the source of his power...

14:17.779 --> 14:19.656
- Nope.
- ...your axe was the source...

14:19.739 --> 14:20.615
- Nope.
- ...of your...

14:20.698 --> 14:21.658
Nope.

14:22.408 --> 14:23.243
Nope.

14:23.326 --> 14:27.330
Anyway, feel the power of my mighty wind!

14:45.056 --> 14:47.892
If we are going to keep falling
from the sky,

14:47.976 --> 14:51.187
could you not set up some mattresses
or something?

14:52.230 --> 14:54.774
Is it too optimistic to assume
that it went well?

14:58.111 --> 14:59.195
That is how it went.

14:59.821 --> 15:02.031
I can't do anything right.

15:02.699 --> 15:04.951
There must be some way to stop Toutatis.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.121
No. Toutatis will destroy you all.

15:09.789 --> 15:10.832
I am useless.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.210
All I can do is this.

15:14.294 --> 15:16.087
And this.

15:16.170 --> 15:17.255
And this.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.688
Taranis has truly amazing powers.

15:33.771 --> 15:37.442
If only he believed in himself,
he could easily beat Toutatis.

15:37.525 --> 15:38.693
You're right!

15:38.776 --> 15:40.611
We just need to give him confidence.

15:45.408 --> 15:47.160
And I know how to do that.

15:47.243 --> 15:50.163
By giving Taranis my powers!

15:50.580 --> 15:53.583
Puss, we've been over this.
You don't have powers, remember?

15:53.666 --> 15:55.960
We know that, but he does not.

15:56.044 --> 15:59.339
Of course, it will be a great
and noble sacrifice on my part.

15:59.422 --> 16:00.882
Giving up the powers you don't have?

16:00.965 --> 16:04.177
Because I will no longer be admired
as a god-cat.

16:06.054 --> 16:08.931
- Not really a great sacrifice.
- But do not try to stop me.

16:09.015 --> 16:10.016
- We weren't.
- I must do this!

16:10.099 --> 16:12.060
- No one was...
- I have no choice!

16:12.143 --> 16:15.438
Well... thanks?

16:15.521 --> 16:19.108
Fairy wings and fairy breath
and nose fire?

16:19.192 --> 16:20.026
For me?

16:20.109 --> 16:21.069
Yes, yes.

16:21.152 --> 16:24.155
I will give you all of my magical,
stunning powers,

16:24.238 --> 16:26.741
and with them,
you can finally defeat Toutatis!

16:26.824 --> 16:29.077
Huzzah!

16:29.160 --> 16:31.037
This is like Christmas for gods!

16:31.120 --> 16:31.954
God-mas!

16:32.246 --> 16:34.957
Oh, but how will you give me your powers?

16:35.541 --> 16:38.836
- Hmm.
- Super Friendship High Five!

16:39.587 --> 16:40.880
Huh? Huh?

16:40.963 --> 16:43.424
Ah! I am not worthy!

16:44.008 --> 16:46.427
Let us get this over with.

16:52.308 --> 16:53.142
Okay.

17:11.368 --> 17:16.457
Former god-cat Puss in Boots,
now just regular old Cat in Shoes.

17:16.540 --> 17:22.130
Thank you for your powers.
It seems your true power is selflessness.

17:22.213 --> 17:25.967
- Now, let's go save everyone!
- Whoa!

17:28.428 --> 17:31.931
♪ Toutatis rules
Toutatis is great ♪

17:32.014 --> 17:36.227
♪ Toutatis will destroy
All the mortals, mate! ♪

17:40.982 --> 17:42.233
Toutatis!

17:44.026 --> 17:45.820
Can't a god jam in peace?

17:46.821 --> 17:50.324
I now possess the powers of the god-cat.

17:50.408 --> 17:52.869
Let us settle this once and for all.

17:52.952 --> 17:55.496
Whatever. Let's get this over with.

17:56.497 --> 17:57.415
Fairy breath!

18:02.003 --> 18:04.380
Oh, it's so foul!

18:04.964 --> 18:09.010
You think you can defeat me
with gingivitis?

18:09.093 --> 18:10.845
I am the All-Father!

18:10.928 --> 18:13.347
You are no match for my fairy wings!

18:16.476 --> 18:18.769
I can't see my fairy wings.

18:18.853 --> 18:21.314
Um... Probably your cape
is covering them!

18:21.397 --> 18:24.108
Of course!

18:34.702 --> 18:36.954
Looks like I got your wheel, mate.

18:37.830 --> 18:41.250
And I have got your axe!

18:41.959 --> 18:43.794
Haven't we been over this?

18:43.878 --> 18:45.129
You can't do anything.

18:45.213 --> 18:48.007
I can do this!

18:53.888 --> 18:55.515
And now, Toutatis,

18:55.598 --> 18:59.101
let us see how you fare against nose fire!

19:13.658 --> 19:15.159
Why is nothing happening?

19:15.243 --> 19:17.328
You can do it. I believe in you.

19:18.204 --> 19:20.540
You... believe in me?

19:21.040 --> 19:22.375
Uh...

19:22.625 --> 19:23.459
Sure.

19:27.672 --> 19:29.257
Enough of this!

19:41.143 --> 19:42.186
Huzzah!

19:48.568 --> 19:51.904
I literally have no idea
what is happening right now.

20:07.962 --> 20:11.173
No! Not the nose fire!
Anything but the nose fire!

20:11.257 --> 20:13.509
I surrender, mate! I surrender!

20:13.593 --> 20:15.511
Taranis! You did it!

20:17.346 --> 20:18.973
Hmm? Mmm.

20:19.056 --> 20:21.142
No, we did it!

20:21.225 --> 20:23.561
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you beat me.

20:23.644 --> 20:26.731
Big whoop. The realm's your problem now.

20:26.814 --> 20:30.359
Good luck ruling a kingdom
full of insufferable ingrates.

20:31.152 --> 20:34.363
Explain your meaning again
with smaller words.

20:35.114 --> 20:37.658
Mortals used to flock to our shrines.

20:38.075 --> 20:40.703
They feared us. They worshiped us.

20:41.412 --> 20:43.831
Now, no one even knows we exist.

20:44.665 --> 20:47.001
I just wanted to make them
believe in me again.

20:47.251 --> 20:49.045
By destroying us all?

20:49.128 --> 20:50.379
Yeah, well.

20:50.463 --> 20:53.215
Okay, maybe I should have
thought that one through more.

20:53.799 --> 20:57.094
Never fear, Toutatis,
for the cat with boots believes.

20:57.762 --> 20:58.804
Is this true?

20:58.888 --> 21:01.849
Yes. I mean, you are standing
right in front of me.

21:01.932 --> 21:02.808
Really?

21:04.226 --> 21:06.562
Well, all right!

21:10.441 --> 21:13.694
I'm sorry I gave you
so much trouble, Taranis.

21:13.778 --> 21:16.489
I guess I'm just used to
being the front man, you know?

21:16.572 --> 21:18.532
I accept your apology.

21:19.867 --> 21:22.953
Perhaps we could rule together?

21:23.537 --> 21:25.039
Two lead singers, huh?

21:26.290 --> 21:27.583
Yeah, I could rock that.

21:31.837 --> 21:33.589
You gonna keep the wings, mate?

21:35.633 --> 21:38.427
Hmm. Yes! I like 'em!

21:38.511 --> 21:41.806
Puss in Boots,
I will return your other powers.

21:42.390 --> 21:43.516
Oh! My powers!

21:43.599 --> 21:45.601
Um. No, no, no, that is all right.

21:45.685 --> 21:47.561
Super Friendship High Five!

21:47.645 --> 21:49.605
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

22:00.533 --> 22:03.744
Much better than a mattress.

22:03.828 --> 22:05.788
Abomination!

22:06.997 --> 22:10.543
Dulcinea, we may not be any closer
to finding the Obelisk,

22:10.626 --> 22:13.170
but I have solved the problems of a god.

22:13.254 --> 22:15.339
If I can do that, then I,

22:15.423 --> 22:18.467
the One from the Great Prophecy,
can do anything!

22:19.385 --> 22:21.512
You're a true hero, Puss.

22:21.595 --> 22:23.764
No matter what anyone says about you.

22:23.848 --> 22:25.891
Wait, what do they say about me?

22:26.308 --> 22:28.561
Things about my boots?

22:28.644 --> 22:30.729
Trampoline party!

22:30.813 --> 22:32.815
Dulcinea, this isn't funny.

22:32.898 --> 22:35.568
Is it my hat?
It is too big, right?

22:35.651 --> 22:38.863
My breath? Come on!
What is it?

22:39.305 --> 22:45.218
