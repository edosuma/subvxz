00:34.502 --> 00:38.132
Excuse me, Judy.
Can you move your hair off my desk?

00:38.966 --> 00:41.468
You mean my luscious fluffs?

00:41.468 --> 00:44.554
You're getting your dandruff
all over my worksheet.

00:44.554 --> 00:47.308
You know you like it, Stud.

00:49.393 --> 00:51.771
So long and perfumy.

00:52.896 --> 00:56.692
Seriously, move your hair.

01:57.545 --> 01:58.878
Hi!

02:05.970 --> 02:09.098
I liked you, you fucking asshole.
I loved you!

02:21.068 --> 02:26.115
If I knew I could care for my family
during a terrifying and uncertain time,

02:26.115 --> 02:28.283
with just a bucket or two?

02:29.075 --> 02:31.954
Well, I'd be running to my pocketbook.

02:32.288 --> 02:35.374
Not only do Aimee-Leigh
and I want you to be safe,

02:36.250 --> 02:40.755
the Lord wants you to be safe.
Jesus talked to me last night.

02:41.546 --> 02:45.217
Jesus said,
"Eli, you better get them folks ready."

02:46.050 --> 02:53.142
"Y2K is real. It's coming.
And the church is gonna need help."

02:55.268 --> 02:58.773
"I agreed to talk with you because
you're from Time Magazine."

02:58.773 --> 03:00.774
That's a periodical I respect.

03:01.107 --> 03:04.612
Your church raised an enormous
amount of money by telling people

03:04.612 --> 03:08.324
that Y2K would bring the end of days.
It didn't, of course.

03:08.324 --> 03:12.410
The grace of the Lord prevented
humanity from facing that disaster.

03:12.787 --> 03:15.873
Indeed. You seemed
pretty convinced it was happening.

03:16.332 --> 03:18.751
Do you think it's unethical
to scare people,

03:18.751 --> 03:21.211
and then benefit from that fear
mongering?

03:21.211 --> 03:24.589
Folks come to me when they trying
to make sense of the world.

03:25.173 --> 03:27.343
I just help them as best I can.

03:27.343 --> 03:30.971
So who was wrong?
Jesus or you?

03:33.556 --> 03:36.894
Amber, baby, they love you.

03:37.311 --> 03:40.064
You had them wrapped around
your finger at Parents' Weekend.

03:40.064 --> 03:43.858
But this is different,
bringing me to your mansion.

03:44.692 --> 03:50.990
- Oh, it's all so daunting.
- Well, better get undaunted, baby.

03:53.034 --> 03:56.288
'Cause one day this crib
will all be mine,

03:57.123 --> 03:59.709
and I'm looking to have
your fine ass by my side.

04:00.126 --> 04:03.461
He cut my damn hair and
tried to Samson my ass.

04:03.461 --> 04:07.466
- I wasn't just gonna take that.
- Tell your teacher or your principal.

04:07.466 --> 04:10.136
You stay out of it.
You don't act like a lunatic.

04:10.136 --> 04:11.595
- That's right.
- Tell me about it.

04:11.595 --> 04:14.514
I bring my say and my baby all the
way here to get to know my family,

04:14.514 --> 04:18.560
and we're instantly dealing with all
this, he said, she said bullshit.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.354
- Suck my dick, Jesse.
- You suck mine. Judy.

04:21.354 --> 04:23.816
I want a meal, boy.
Not no snack.

04:25.317 --> 04:28.903
That was good. She's saying
that you have a tiny little tt.

04:28.903 --> 04:33.116
Fuck off, Kelvin. At least I got a tt.
Not a tiny doll pecker like you.

04:33.116 --> 04:35.744
- Not even any hairs or nothing.
- Enough!

04:35.744 --> 04:37.162
We have a guest.

04:37.829 --> 04:40.999
This is not the impression
we wanna give you, Amber.

04:40.999 --> 04:44.295
My apologies.
It's a blessing to have you with us.

04:44.295 --> 04:49.258
- Where you from, sweetheart?
- Kentucky. Just a small little town.

04:49.633 --> 04:53.095
Is that human hair, Country?
You wearing a horse hair wig?

04:54.971 --> 04:58.600
It's real hair. Not a wig.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.729
Judy, why don't you slide this
chicken fried steak with gravy

05:02.729 --> 05:04.022
right up your ass?

05:04.022 --> 05:06.067
I wasn't trying to be mean.
She's from the country.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.484
So I called her "Country".

05:07.484 --> 05:10.946
All the best girls are country girls.
Ain't that right, darlin'?

05:10.946 --> 05:12.614
Don't you know it.

05:22.041 --> 05:25.251
If it isn't the girl
from the Wendy's sign.

05:26.337 --> 05:28.547
Y'all got running water
where you're from?

05:30.841 --> 05:33.761
- Of course we do.
- Well I don't know your life.

05:35.262 --> 05:39.265
Look at you, just regular
ass shopping mall clothes.

05:41.893 --> 05:45.605
- Your pants are nice.
- Well take a good look.

05:48.109 --> 05:49.901
Because you couldn't afford this

05:49.901 --> 05:53.863
if you sucked every dick
in the hills and hollers of Kentucky.

05:54.322 --> 05:58.202
- What is your problem?
- I just know what you're up to.

06:00.287 --> 06:04.709
Impoverished girl with big dreams.
Chasing all the riches and gold.

06:05.208 --> 06:10.840
That is not what's happening here.
Jesse means a lot to me.

06:11.882 --> 06:15.469
I call bull. You don't love Jesse,
he's a fucking clown.

06:16.971 --> 06:21.182
When you look at his dumb face,
instead of seeing eyes and shit,

06:22.475 --> 06:25.062
you see your ticket out
of the sticks.

06:25.062 --> 06:27.273
You are very rude!

06:28.398 --> 06:31.484
And you have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:32.945 --> 06:37.198
Where you going, Wendy's?
I thought we were doing girl talks.

06:57.010 --> 06:59.138
- It's our faith.
- Yeah!

06:59.138 --> 07:01.557
Our faith.
That protects us.

07:03.141 --> 07:05.186
Be not afraid,

07:05.894 --> 07:10.648
for I am Daniel in the lion's den!

07:11.734 --> 07:12.902
Amen!

07:14.486 --> 07:17.614
- We'll see you next week.
- Good to see you.

07:17.614 --> 07:20.201
- Thanks so much for coming.
- Sure. Hey.

07:20.742 --> 07:24.413
That's lovely. What a sweetheart.
Thank you.

07:24.413 --> 07:26.206
You guys were on doughnuts
next week.

07:26.206 --> 07:30.335
J1013 AM, Christian Talk. Mixing it up
with the biggest names in Faith.

07:30.335 --> 07:32.337
Now back to Skip Arness Show.

07:32.670 --> 07:34.924
You hear the latest
on the Gemstones?

07:34.924 --> 07:38.927
Their church made a mint off the
Y2K scare. Millions.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.930
Attendance is down for the first
time in their history

07:41.930 --> 07:44.684
and people are protesting
outside their church.

07:44.684 --> 07:48.645
- They deserve every criticism.
- Did Uncle Eli do something wrong?

07:48.645 --> 07:52.023
Your uncle was raised better, but
he's always been greedy for money.

07:52.023 --> 07:53.900
- Y'all know that.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.403
I wanna be rich like Uncle Eli
when I grow up.

07:56.986 --> 08:00.866
Don't you ever say that again.
That is not something to aspire to.

08:01.325 --> 08:04.536
You aspire to be good
and wise like your Daddy, right, Peter?

08:04.536 --> 08:07.288
- He is just a kid talking, May-May.
- Dummy.

08:08.791 --> 08:12.669
I was just kidding, Momma.
I love being poor.

08:17.048 --> 08:20.261
I still don't like that you all
got him buried out here.

08:20.261 --> 08:21.971
It's a long drive for us.

08:21.971 --> 08:26.224
Whenever I wanna spend time with Dad
I gotta get through your guards.

08:26.224 --> 08:29.478
There weren't no more room left
where Momma's resting.

08:29.894 --> 08:32.814
I thought about bringing her
here to put with him.

08:32.814 --> 08:35.985
That's sweet. Then you can just
have 'em all, can't you, Eli?

08:35.985 --> 08:39.654
We can have security flag y'all right
on through anytime you wanna come by.

08:39.988 --> 08:42.366
- Our home is your home.
- We appreciate that.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.785
We don't usually have
no problem getting in.

08:44.785 --> 08:48.622
I made some sandwiches for the boys.
Might as well eat them before we go.

08:49.206 --> 08:52.167
You all are welcome to stay
as long as you want to.

09:04.387 --> 09:07.558
Nobody shit their pants.
But check out my newest toy.

09:17.109 --> 09:18.485
My Lord.

09:19.110 --> 09:20.613
Holy moly.

09:21.489 --> 09:22.989
Coke White.

09:22.989 --> 09:26.452
- This is yours?
- Basically mine.

09:26.910 --> 09:29.662
I mean, technically
it belongs to the church.

09:29.662 --> 09:34.876
But all I gotta do is use it in a sermon
and then I can drive it whenever I want.

09:34.876 --> 09:36.670
- Can I drive it?
- Hell no.

09:37.504 --> 09:40.215
But I'd be happy to let you
watch me smash some shit.

09:54.605 --> 09:55.815
Oh, my God!

10:36.605 --> 10:38.773
Hey, you know,
I saw y'all on the news.

10:38.773 --> 10:42.570
They were saying you conned everyone
with the Y2K nonsense.

10:43.362 --> 10:46.115
I don't know what kind of idiot
would buy into that.

10:46.448 --> 10:49.701
When the world ends it will be because
the Lord has decided it's time,

10:49.701 --> 10:53.664
not because computer malfunctions.
I never bought it for a minute.

10:53.664 --> 10:56.875
I'm just relieved it didn't happen.
That's all I keep thinking about,

10:56.875 --> 10:58.753
just counting our lucky stars.

10:58.753 --> 11:02.213
Would have been a real nightmare.
Lord changed his mind I suppose.

11:02.213 --> 11:04.884
Or people just made it up
to make money off it.

11:04.884 --> 11:07.386
That's what the news
is saying you did.

11:08.137 --> 11:11.807
It's times like these I sure am glad
my last name is Montgomery.

11:12.140 --> 11:15.061
The way people would look at me if
my last name was still Gemstone?

11:15.061 --> 11:18.646
No thank you.
You know, I need refill.

11:18.646 --> 11:21.775
Peter, run out to the car and get me
that two-liter bottle of Fresca.

11:21.775 --> 11:24.611
We got plenty of cold pop inside
in the refrigerator, May-May.

11:24.611 --> 11:27.072
- Sprite, I think.
- I don't want a Sprite. I like Fresca.

11:27.072 --> 11:29.074
- Peter...
- Sprite or...

11:29.074 --> 11:30.617
Car.

11:31.117 --> 11:32.702
- Run.
- Yup.

11:32.702 --> 11:34.455
Say Say my Baby.

11:38.416 --> 11:41.087
I got the Sega Saturn.
Have you played it?

11:41.087 --> 11:43.755
- Momma don't let us play video games.
- She says the devil's in 'em.

11:44.090 --> 11:45.465
Inside video games?

11:45.465 --> 11:49.720
Just like movies, music, dancing,
cartoons, and Halloween.

11:50.096 --> 11:52.723
We ain't allowed to do nothin',
except maybe go huntin',

11:52.723 --> 11:57.102
make some traps, catch food. Not like
you. Y'all get to do everything fun.

11:57.102 --> 12:00.022
Yeah, your parents suck.
They're strict as hell.

12:00.022 --> 12:03.358
I couldn't survive under your roof.
I need my TRL.

12:03.358 --> 12:06.736
I can relate, Judy.
My Grandma's real strict.

12:07.112 --> 12:09.782
Never let any boys call the house
or nothing.

12:10.115 --> 12:15.870
You had so many boys calling the house.
'Cause of your gorgeous red hair?

12:16.205 --> 12:20.376
Raggedy Ann, surprised they even have
phones in the village you come from.

12:20.792 --> 12:22.752
She don't come from
no damn village, Judy.

12:22.752 --> 12:25.380
Stop making fun of people
for being from poverty.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.466
Chuck and Karl are dirt poor,
it's rude.

12:28.466 --> 12:30.886
Jesse, I'm so sick of you
showing out for your girlfriend.

12:30.886 --> 12:33.931
You all don't make a good couple.
Behind your back,

12:33.931 --> 12:39.978
we're all laughing at what a bad couple
you actually are. Hardy Har Æ dummy.

12:40.312 --> 12:41.938
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Judy?

12:43.149 --> 12:45.442
- What?
- It's a sin to swear, Jesse.

12:45.442 --> 12:47.902
No shit, Karl. Watch me load
up some more.

12:48.237 --> 12:50.072
Judy, you wish you had
a fucking boyfriend.

12:50.072 --> 12:52.908
Don't be jealous 'cause somebody
likes me besides my own parents.

12:52.908 --> 12:55.828
Unlike you.
No one likes your ass.

13:09.341 --> 13:11.469
Hey Peter, come on in.

13:23.981 --> 13:25.900
I'm in a bit of a pinch, Eli.

13:26.649 --> 13:28.152
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

13:30.028 --> 13:34.032
I got a damn warehouse full of Y2K
buckets and nobody wants 'em.

13:34.032 --> 13:38.369
Yes. The only downside
to society not collapsing.

13:47.337 --> 13:49.215
I'm in over my head, Eli.

13:49.547 --> 13:52.175
I told you not to buy more
than you can afford.

13:52.175 --> 13:54.761
You also told me that
the world was gonna end.

13:54.761 --> 13:59.307
It ain't my fault things changed.
I got no control over that.

13:59.307 --> 14:03.062
Liquidate'em. Repackage them
as camping supplies or something.

14:03.062 --> 14:06.565
Hell, if I could count the amount
of bad business investments

14:06.565 --> 14:08.858
I've made in my life
we'd be here all day.

14:08.858 --> 14:11.654
It's the nature of the beast.
You win some, you lose some.

14:11.654 --> 14:15.408
Yeah. I lost a lot.

14:17.785 --> 14:20.913
Twenty-five grand,
that's a lot of money for my family.

14:20.913 --> 14:23.081
That's everything
we had in savings.

14:24.499 --> 14:28.629
Damn, Peter.
Why would you invest all your savings?

14:28.629 --> 14:33.591
'Cause I trusted you. I wanted to do
what you were doing.

14:34.676 --> 14:37.430
May-May is gonna kill me.

14:37.430 --> 14:41.892
She's gonna kill me because
we're broke, 'cause I didn't tell her.

14:41.892 --> 14:44.936
She's gonna kill you because
you did it with me.

14:47.857 --> 14:51.902
I've never asked you for money.
I don't know what else to do.

14:53.863 --> 14:58.075
- I could lose the house.
- How about I buy your stock back?

15:10.838 --> 15:12.798
I don't know what to say.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.763
I just got so greedy.

15:20.263 --> 15:22.766
You thought you were helping
your family.

15:24.976 --> 15:27.687
I thought we were coming to
the End of Times.

15:33.068 --> 15:35.446
Did you really believe that too, Eli?

15:37.031 --> 15:39.658
You think I'm just out there
lying to people?

15:47.123 --> 15:49.668
Take us in through
the service entrance, Walker.

15:49.668 --> 15:51.419
We can drive right in through
the loadi bay.

15:51.419 --> 15:53.047
You got it, Dr. Gemstone.

16:16.112 --> 16:20.615
That's the coolest thing ever!

16:20.615 --> 16:24.119
And that is what you call
a moist maker.

16:24.119 --> 16:26.621
My monster truck is the fuckin' tits.

16:26.621 --> 16:29.082
- Jesse, have you seen my ring?
- Your ring?

16:29.082 --> 16:32.627
My grandma gave it to me?
I wear it all the time.

16:32.627 --> 16:34.671
I must've misplaced it.

16:35.088 --> 16:39.969
When things go missing in this house
it's usually one person responsible.

16:41.219 --> 16:43.930
- Who?
- Judy.

16:44.764 --> 16:48.268
- You think Judy stole Amber's ring?
- I don't know.

16:48.728 --> 16:51.104
She's been stealing
a bunch of stuff lately.

16:51.104 --> 16:55.150
I went to the mall with her a few weeks
ago. I hate going to places with Judy.

16:55.150 --> 16:57.777
Especially the shopping mall.

16:59.405 --> 17:00.905
She steals music.

17:04.618 --> 17:06.786
She shoplifts fancy fashions.

17:12.585 --> 17:14.128
Tiny trinkets.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.760
And some other stuff that
I don't even know what it is.

17:22.635 --> 17:25.848
She threatened to cut my privates off
if I told Mom and Daddy.

17:26.806 --> 17:30.394
Judy will do it.
I know she will.

17:30.394 --> 17:33.397
That bitch could steal from
all the malls in America.

17:33.397 --> 17:37.068
But steal from my woman? My queen
My Say Say my Baby?

17:38.110 --> 17:40.528
She's gone one step too fuckin' far.

17:42.989 --> 17:46.702
We live in a world
where material things,

17:49.162 --> 17:54.001
wealth, status,
it means something.

17:54.502 --> 17:55.710
Amen.

17:56.295 --> 18:00.257
That stuff don't mean nothing
to the Lord.

18:01.674 --> 18:03.760
So why does it mean
so much to us?

18:06.679 --> 18:11.518
I think I know why. Because of
the people we love. That's why.

18:12.560 --> 18:19.276
It can be hard seeing others thriving
and living a life of wealth, comfort,

18:19.276 --> 18:23.739
while you watch your own family
not able to live in the same way.

18:23.739 --> 18:28.703
Not given the same opportunities.
Or maybe we don't need those things.

18:28.703 --> 18:32.747
It can be hard not to feel like
you're letting down the ones

18:32.747 --> 18:39.170
that mean the most to you
when you got nothing.

18:43.633 --> 18:45.302
You know what I'm saying?

18:48.931 --> 18:52.517
You changed up the sermon today. I
thought you were gonna be preaching

18:52.517 --> 18:55.521
about outreach, instead
you were talking about wealth.

18:55.521 --> 19:00.234
- Well, the message seemed important.
- You've been acting funny lately, Peter.

19:00.234 --> 19:02.694
The boys have noticed it.
Haven't you boys?

19:03.070 --> 19:06.281
- Yeah, maybe a little.
- Just a bit quieter than usual.

19:06.281 --> 19:08.450
Don't talk with your mouth full.

19:12.871 --> 19:14.622
Peter, are you crying?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.542
I made a mistake.

19:20.378 --> 19:23.132
- I made a bad investment.
- Investment?

19:24.967 --> 19:28.678
You tricked him. You've been pullin'
this stuff since we was kids.

19:28.678 --> 19:32.266
- No, he didn't trick me none, May-May.
- You're a fool, Peter.

19:32.266 --> 19:35.853
Eli did this on purpose. To punish me?
What did I ever did to you, Eli?

19:35.853 --> 19:38.230
You need to calm down, May-May.

19:38.230 --> 19:40.316
I'm trying to help you all.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.069
I'm the one that's gonna get stuck
with all the overstock.

19:44.611 --> 19:48.115
Over, overstock? You think
you're damn Sears, Roebuck?

19:48.115 --> 19:52.243
Talking my husband into investing
what little we have into nonsense.

19:52.243 --> 19:55.288
Complete nonsense!
That was the boys' college money.

19:55.706 --> 19:58.917
He's gonna buy it back. We're not
gonna lose anything, May-May.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.920
- Eli's gonna help.
- No.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.547
We are not taking a penny
from you and your damn wife.

20:03.547 --> 20:07.468
That money is evil. It rotted your
family, I will not have it rotting mine.

20:07.468 --> 20:12.305
We have to. If we don't,
I can lose the house.

20:15.141 --> 20:16.476
I'm sorry.

20:18.979 --> 20:22.399
Let us help, May-May.
We're family.

20:23.609 --> 20:28.614
Don't you dare make me think
you're doing us any favors.

20:28.988 --> 20:33.118
Standing there your pretty dresses,
singing your little songs,

20:33.744 --> 20:36.246
pretending you don't know
what's going on.

20:36.246 --> 20:40.042
But I see right through you.
You enable his behavior.

20:40.584 --> 20:46.340
You promote it! You and your whole
damn family! You got the devil in you.

20:46.340 --> 20:49.468
You're about to see him if you don't get
the hell out of my house.

20:49.468 --> 20:51.094
Talk to my wife like that.

20:51.094 --> 20:52.971
I look at your ugly face
and I think to myself,

20:52.971 --> 20:55.641
"I may be poor,
but at least I got principles."

20:55.641 --> 20:58.184
Shove your principles up your ass!

20:58.184 --> 21:01.855
You'd let your kids go hungry
to prove a point, you dumb bag!

21:03.106 --> 21:04.607
- Thanks, Peter.
- Yep.

21:23.502 --> 21:25.713
It's the way May-May's
always been.

21:26.087 --> 21:29.091
Always trying to make me out
like I'm bad,

21:29.091 --> 21:33.012
even since we was kids.
Now I gotta bail her husband out,

21:33.012 --> 21:35.722
and I'm still somehow gonna be
the bad guy.

21:39.977 --> 21:46.107
I just feel so ashamed, Eli.
I don't like being seen as dishonest.

21:46.107 --> 21:52.281
And I feel like what we did
was dishonest. Not just you. Me too.

21:54.325 --> 21:56.326
Dishonest is a strong word.

21:57.535 --> 22:00.163
I never believed it was
really gonna happen.

22:02.999 --> 22:05.544
- Did you?
- No.

22:08.254 --> 22:14.511
I guess I romanticized the idea
at first, not civilization ending

22:14.511 --> 22:21.394
but going back to a simple way of life.
Worshipping God the old-fashioned way.

22:22.852 --> 22:26.065
Raising kids without
the trappings of all this wealth.

22:27.273 --> 22:30.277
Sometimes I think that's
the best idea for our family.

22:31.236 --> 22:33.989
Growing up poor
ain't all it's cracked up to be.

22:37.158 --> 22:39.244
I think no matter what you do,

22:39.244 --> 22:42.748
you're gonna end up with kids
who don't listen to a word you say.

22:43.456 --> 22:45.583
It ain't that way with
May-May and Peter's kids.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.796
- You don't hear them mouthing off.
- You don't see 'em smilin' either.

22:48.796 --> 22:52.006
They're scared.
They afraid to speak.

22:52.006 --> 22:53.759
You think I got heavy hands?

22:54.552 --> 22:57.638
I guarantee,
May-May smacks the shit out of 'em.

22:58.847 --> 23:00.474
That's how Daddy raised us.

23:00.474 --> 23:03.644
Well, our kids ain't scared to speak,
that's for sure.

23:03.644 --> 23:05.061
No, they're not.

23:05.061 --> 23:08.607
It's because I only smacked them
half the time I felt the urge to.

23:10.151 --> 23:14.155
Eli, I know they're spoiled.
But did we ruin them?

23:14.155 --> 23:17.031
I would say ruined.
There's still hope.

23:17.407 --> 23:20.286
- Even for Judy?
- Even for Judy.

23:21.328 --> 23:25.332
She's just got some minor
undiagnosed mental problems.

23:25.332 --> 23:27.668
Nothing a rubber room won't fix.

23:32.714 --> 23:34.633
For her or us?

23:38.637 --> 23:41.724
- She's a mess.
- She is a mess.

23:51.317 --> 23:53.276
All right.
Get up.

23:53.276 --> 23:56.404
I know we've knocked each other
around, but I never hit you back.

23:56.404 --> 23:59.074
If you don't cough up Amber's ring,
we're gonna fight for real.

23:59.074 --> 24:01.077
Understand my words?

24:04.746 --> 24:07.457
I know you're not sleeping, Judy.
Stop playing.

24:08.042 --> 24:10.752
I ain't playing like I'm sleeping,
Jesse. You're saying that.

24:10.752 --> 24:12.713
- I'm just fucking laying here.
- Face me!

24:13.088 --> 24:15.423
I'm trying to have a hardcore
come to Jesus talk with you right now

24:15.423 --> 24:18.761
and you're being very rude
with your body positioning to me.

24:26.060 --> 24:29.980
Why are you crying? Are Momma and
Daddy putting you up for adoption?

24:29.980 --> 24:32.233
Can you just leave me alone?

24:33.775 --> 24:35.736
Did you steal Amber's ring?

24:37.404 --> 24:39.907
She left it.
Finders Keepers.

24:40.574 --> 24:45.203
Her grandma, who is a dead
person now, gave it to her.

24:45.203 --> 24:47.707
So you're not finders keeping it.

24:49.666 --> 24:53.294
- It's trash anyway. Not worth nothin'.
- How do you know that?

24:53.294 --> 24:56.631
I took it to the pawn shop
and Mars-Eye Larry said it ain't shit.

24:57.465 --> 25:02.095
- Jesus, Judy. What is wrong with you?
- I don't know, Jesse. Wish I did.

25:04.514 --> 25:08.561
I've just been getting
so bored here. You're gone.

25:09.144 --> 25:12.398
I'm stuck with baby dick Kelvin
all the time

25:13.733 --> 25:16.318
and I just get real excited sometimes.

25:17.318 --> 25:19.821
I wanna do things my own way,

25:19.821 --> 25:24.118
and when it feels like my own way
ain't workin' or startin' to look bad,

25:25.618 --> 25:28.581
something goes off in me,
it just feels warm.

25:28.914 --> 25:35.712
My ears get hot, I figure, fuck it!
They want it, let's give 'em some.

25:37.297 --> 25:44.013
Word. My motor runs hot, too.
It's that Gemstone temper we both got.

25:44.387 --> 25:48.058
We get that from Daddy.
Kelvin is more like Momma that way.

25:48.058 --> 25:53.689
Handles things more like a girl does.
Just sensitively and stuff.

25:54.106 --> 25:56.649
But you're more like me.

25:56.984 --> 26:01.989
You handle things like most men just,
you know, fucking mash everything.

26:03.491 --> 26:05.784
I think it's actually kind of cool.

26:05.784 --> 26:08.162
You don't think that makes it
so people don't like me?

26:08.162 --> 26:11.790
Weaks and wieners don't like you, Judy.
But who needs them?

26:16.796 --> 26:23.386
The dreamboat who cut my hair,
Trent, I liked him a lot.

26:23.386 --> 26:28.307
And he didn't like me back.
Made me feel so embarrassed.

26:29.182 --> 26:34.814
Made me feel dumb for even trying.
Like, who is gonna like me?

26:36.107 --> 26:39.026
Someone will, all right?
God will make sure.

26:39.026 --> 26:42.445
Just like he did for Momma and Daddy,
and me and Amber.

26:42.445 --> 26:46.699
No, Jesse. You and Amber are not
the same thing as Momma and Daddy.

26:47.409 --> 26:50.870
- We're one true loves, bitch.
- Quit making me hurl, boy.

26:57.294 --> 27:01.924
Why the hell are they still out there?
Can't we have them removed?

27:01.924 --> 27:05.511
Legally, we can.
But, it wouldn't look good.

27:05.511 --> 27:08.012
They are members of the church,
after all.

27:09.139 --> 27:13.853
- What do I do?
- I suggest you talk to them.

27:17.523 --> 27:19.274
Whoever it is, come on out.

27:23.486 --> 27:25.865
"I won't marry you
if you're cheating!"

27:29.285 --> 27:31.035
What's up, Country?

27:31.662 --> 27:34.290
Jesse said you were looking
for a ring or something?

27:34.290 --> 27:39.085
Yes. It went missing.
Judy, my Grandma raised me...

27:39.085 --> 27:42.631
I don't really care. Is this it?
Found it in the toilet.

27:43.049 --> 27:47.093
- Yes. It is.
- How do I know for sure?

27:48.219 --> 27:51.890
You could be saying it's yours cause it
looks like it's worth a bunch of money.

27:51.890 --> 27:54.726
There's a tiny cross engraved
on the underneath.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.482
Well, what do you know?

28:03.359 --> 28:06.488
I actually do like your hair.

28:07.781 --> 28:10.825
I wasn't making fun when
I was asking if it was real.

28:10.825 --> 28:14.705
Well, thank you, Judy.

28:16.623 --> 28:19.335
Sweet.
Don't get a big head about it, though.

28:27.550 --> 28:29.886
GEMSTONE SURVIVAL BUCKET

28:42.941 --> 28:45.695
You crook!
You ripped people off!

28:45.695 --> 28:48.988
How much money did you make
swingling people, Dr. Gemstone?

28:48.988 --> 28:52.826
I never swindled nobody.
If you all wanna have a discussion,

28:53.159 --> 28:57.206
I'm all ears, you're gonna cast
aspersions, I'll just go back inside.

28:59.416 --> 29:02.628
Through God's grace,
we are not living

29:02.628 --> 29:06.131
in the dystopian world that
Y2K threatened us with.

29:06.131 --> 29:09.843
Prayers and the Lord our Savior
have kept us safe once again.

29:09.843 --> 29:13.305
My predictions were wrong.
I was wrong.

29:18.435 --> 29:23.022
The Lord sees all. And we will answer
to all of our sins.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.775
That's just the way it goes.

29:25.942 --> 29:29.780
- You Trent?
- Yeah. Who are you, Dark Man?

29:48.840 --> 29:53.137
It's hard to admit you were wrong,
but I'll do it because the Lord knows.

29:53.137 --> 29:55.264
So what's the point in hiding?

29:55.264 --> 29:58.224
You think I'm more afraid of you
than I am of Him?

29:59.267 --> 30:03.898
The world didn't end.
If this church raised money

30:03.898 --> 30:06.608
when people thought
the world was going to end.

30:08.151 --> 30:10.278
It's because they wanted God.

30:11.613 --> 30:14.991
I'm standing here giving Him to you.

30:15.533 --> 30:17.035
That's bullshit.

30:17.370 --> 30:19.370
How are we supposed to believe you?

30:19.913 --> 30:22.375
We will not lose sight of our mission.

30:25.044 --> 30:30.048
And our mission is to serve you
in a way that is befitting of the Lord.

30:31.883 --> 30:37.847
Put down your signs
and come back and worship with us.

30:40.183 --> 30:42.436
We a not your enemy.
We love you.

30:43.729 --> 30:46.691
And we want to help you see
the light in our savior.

31:02.498 --> 31:04.583
That is our purpose.

31:05.960 --> 31:10.548
Making sure we take as many
souls with us to those pearly gates

31:11.047 --> 31:13.925
as we possibly can. Amen.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.010
Amen.

31:20.558 --> 31:21.975
Put the gun down!

31:31.317 --> 31:33.153
Hold it! Hold it there!

31:37.408 --> 31:38.867
Stay there!
