- You're pushed.
- We got a game going.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.207
- What kind of stakes?
- Five and ten.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.352
- Is the man gonna play?
- Yeah, after the speech.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.336
- He says he's good for a half hour
- Outstanding.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.294

04:14.922 --> 04:16.423
Right there, fella!

05:03.262 --> 05:05.264
Go play some cards, get drunk.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.733
I'm getting too old for this shit.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.135
Yo! <i>Estoy aquí!</i>

Get the 50s ready, guys.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.682
Gilbert. Booze. Free for me.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.310
- Did you bet with me or against me?
- Against you.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.396
- You blew it.
- Against you.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.608
OK, you guys!
It's the moment of truth here.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.276
- Oh, shit.
- Come on!

10:11.361 --> 10:13.238
I told you guys,
never bet against me.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.741
Come on, Petievich,
get a half a yard in here.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.826
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

10:18.243 --> 10:20.203
To my partner, Jimmy Hart,

10:20.370 --> 10:23.624
whose skill in spotting bad paper
is only exceeded by his expertise

10:23.790 --> 10:26.668
- in rigging a safety line.
- Hear, hear!

10:26.835 --> 10:28.962
How about a speech, boss? Speech.

10:29.171 --> 10:32.132
You know, I've been in
this racket 25 years, you guys.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.801
And I don't think anybody

10:34.968 --> 10:37.471
has been put in harm's way
more than I have

10:37.638 --> 10:41.642
- by this hotshot over here. But...
- Don't know how you work with him.

10:41.850 --> 10:46.229
Seriously speaking, if I'm
going in to bag somebody

10:46.396 --> 10:49.191
there's nobody I'd rather have
backing me up.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.984
All right! Hear, hear!

10:51.193 --> 10:53.612
Later, Alvarez. Next time
you can make a jump with me.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.573
- Come on. It's the same thing in your work.
- What?

10:56.740 --> 11:00.452
You push too hard. You take it too
personally. You'll never reach retirement.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.640
- I'm not interested in retirement, buddy.
- Such a fuckin' hot dog. See you later.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.541
Hey, come here, come here.
Got something for you.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.504
Fucking Alvarez trying to pass
a funny 50 on us, huh?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.382
Your retirement present.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.843
- You trying to get rid of me?
- It was burning a hole in my truck.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.972
Wow...

11:22.099 --> 11:23.892
That's a beauty, Richie.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.061
Yeah, they tell me the trout
jump all over it.

11:26.228 --> 11:29.564
- You gonna let me use it?
- Come and see me, you can use it.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.901
I'm gonna miss you, <i>amigo.</i>

11:34.111 --> 11:36.822
Yeah. Me too.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.325
Hey, listen, I know you got
something going tomorrow.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.745
- You reading my mail again?
- Masters, right? Where?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.622
You ain't going out there alone.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.667
I got three more days on the job.
I want to make the most of it.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.294
What's the point of the two of us
running down the same lead?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.422
The point is that we're partners, right?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.841
Sure we are.
And when the bust goes down

11:56.007 --> 11:59.136
you're gonna be there with me,
like always. OK, partner?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.806
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.476
You give me a call
when you get back.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.542
- Shitbag.
- Buddy,

19:27.709 --> 19:31.004
you're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.114
Come on, come on!

20:54.963 --> 20:57.882
- Do you know what we got?
- Nothing.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.766
- Anything around back?
- Check the trailer.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.310
Trailer's clear.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.188
Anything around back?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.775
Clear over here.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.421
Who is it?

23:01.798 --> 23:04.675
- John Vukovich.
- What do you want?

23:04.842 --> 23:07.136
I'd like to speak to you if I could.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.893
I'm sorry about Jimmy Hart.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.563
Jimmy was more than my partner, pal.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.441
He was my best friend
for seven years.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.194
He was the most righteous guy
I ever knew.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.655
He had two days to go,
and that was it.

23:25.822 --> 23:29.242
I can't understand why somebody would
waste him over a counterfeit beef.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.245
Rick Masters killed him.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.664
See, Jimmy got too close.

23:34.831 --> 23:38.668
We had a tail on him and his mule for
six months, but we couldn't make the plant.

23:38.835 --> 23:41.254
Jimmy went to check that warehouse
near Lancaster

23:41.421 --> 23:43.923
because he found out it was rented
under a phony name.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.425
But I don't know.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.177
For some reason he wanted
to go out there by himself.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.930
Now you need a partner.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.890
Let me tell you something, <i>amigo.</i>

23:53.057 --> 23:55.643
I'm gonna bag Masters,
and I don't give a shit how I do it.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.228
I hear you.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.154
Can I talk to you for a minute?

24:06.320 --> 24:09.157
You must be a mind reader.
I was just gonna call you.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.784
I've decided to let Vukovich
work with you.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.706
- Do I have a choice?
- Oh, is there someone else you'd prefer?

24:16.873 --> 24:18.958
You're welcome to fill out
a form 19.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.627
List all the reasons
you'd rather not work with him.

24:21.836 --> 24:25.131
Your input would be
strictly confidential.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.634
Yeah. Forget it.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.722
What is it you wanted to
talk about?

24:41.647 --> 24:45.026
One-way ticket to San Francisco, Mr. Cody.
How would you like to pay?

24:45.193 --> 24:48.571
- In cash.
- That will be $45 one-way.

24:48.738 --> 24:49.864
All right.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.965
Federal agent. Excuse me. I'd like to see
the bills that man just handed you.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.060
Listen, you wouldn't have a pencil with
an eraser I could use, would you?

25:19.227 --> 25:20.867
- Sure. Here you go, sir.
- OK. Thank you.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.335
U.S. Secret Service!

25:44.502 --> 25:46.671
Hold it, man!
Where you going?

26:01.811 --> 26:03.271
Get out of the way!

26:39.974 --> 26:41.726
Excuse me, miss.

26:56.991 --> 26:59.410
Hey, what the hell!
You some kind of freak?

27:15.092 --> 27:17.595
Freeze, asshole!

27:17.803 --> 27:19.180
U.S. Secret Service.

27:19.347 --> 27:22.350
You're under arrest
for possession of counterfeit...

27:22.516 --> 27:24.977
- You're making a mistake!
- Get up there and shut up!

27:25.186 --> 27:28.272
- I'm a businessman. I'm a businessman.
- Put your hands back here!

27:28.439 --> 27:31.317
Stop it, asshole!
I'll blow your head off!

27:31.484 --> 27:35.821
U.S. Secret Service. I'm arresting this guy
for counterfeiting.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.948
Freeze!

27:38.157 --> 27:39.617
- Who are you?
- Secret Service!

27:40.493 --> 27:42.870
I just came in to take a leak.

27:44.747 --> 27:47.041
Morning. Let's go!

27:47.208 --> 27:48.918
Get the bag, John.

28:06.560 --> 28:10.022
You got balls coming here.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.982
How you making it?

28:12.149 --> 28:15.444
Like every other swinging dick
in this place makes it:

28:15.611 --> 28:17.446
Day by motherfucking day.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.031
Ulcer acting up?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.659
I want to know when
you're gonna get me out.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.578
I want you to be patient a little longer, Carl.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.039
I got caught carrying for you.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.333
Now it's my turn
for some consideration.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.700
You have my word, you won't have
to do the whole nickel.

28:31.836 --> 28:35.214
- What does that mean?
- Grimes is the best lawyer in the state.

28:35.423 --> 28:39.051
It'll either be an appeal bond
or a sentence reduction.

28:39.218 --> 28:43.305
And the check is in the mail and I love you
and I promise not to come in your mouth.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.683
I'm doing everything I can.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.019
Carl,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.313
we gotta talk about Waxman.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.023
Well, what about him?

28:53.190 --> 28:56.902
He was your last stop before the airport.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.113
What are you saying?

28:59.280 --> 29:01.824
He said you never delivered
the package.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.872
What do you mean?
He says I...? He never got it?

29:08.038 --> 29:11.459
I counted out 600 grand
right there on his desk.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.754
I had it wrapped in $10,000 packages
like you told me.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.339
He put it in a safe right behind his desk.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.342
He said you called, postponed delivery

29:20.509 --> 29:22.869
and the next thing he heard,
you were busted at the airport.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.680
He's a lying son of a bitch!

29:24.847 --> 29:27.725
He's probably the motherfucker
who did me.

29:27.892 --> 29:31.020
He ratted me to the feds.
I'll kill him when I get out.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.732
I'm gonna give that fucking scumbag
a serious headache.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.151
May God strike me dead
if I don't waste him.

29:37.318 --> 29:38.944
Your visit's over.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.997
Don't forget about me.

29:50.164 --> 29:53.626
I won't.
You have my word on that.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.339
Hell, I've done everything
humanly possible.

29:58.506 --> 30:01.175
At this point,
I don't see any alternative.

30:01.342 --> 30:03.469
Your friend Cody's
gonna have to do some time.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.387
Why is he being held
without bail?

30:05.554 --> 30:08.098
He wants to know
and I can't give him an answer.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.519
Suspicion of murdering
a federal agent named Jim Hart.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.104
You told me you could arrange
an appeal bond.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.941
Even if the judge granted it,
it's only a postponement.

30:17.107 --> 30:20.486
- I can't fucking tell...
- The guy got caught holding 40 grand.

30:20.694 --> 30:21.904
What does he expect?

30:22.071 --> 30:24.782
He'll have to do a little
to keep the prosecutor happy.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.993
How much time?

30:28.202 --> 30:29.537
Say, three.

30:31.372 --> 30:34.875
No, no. He can't do it.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.545
He'll cave in on me.

30:37.711 --> 30:40.130
What can he give them?

30:41.131 --> 30:42.383
Everything.

30:53.477 --> 30:56.522
- So, what's up?
- Can you give me anything on Masters?

30:59.149 --> 31:01.527
There's a guy in Pasadena.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.196
He's a lawyer or something.
Used to represent hippies.

31:04.405 --> 31:05.906
What's his name?

31:06.949 --> 31:11.328
- Waxman. Max Waxman.
- Waxman. What's his story?

31:11.495 --> 31:14.373
I think he's moving paper
for Masters.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.376
Good. Is there anything
I can do for you?

31:17.585 --> 31:19.837
My kid's coming in this weekend
from Las Vegas.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.506
- You got a kid?
- Yeah. His name's Christopher.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.383
He lives with his father
down there.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.052
- Five hundred OK?
- Well, I was kind of hoping...

31:27.261 --> 31:29.889
There's more if there's a bust.
You know the game.

32:36.830 --> 32:40.793
- I had a bad dream last night.
- Tell me.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.838
I was on-stage, and people
were burning me with cigarettes.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.257
Serena once told me
she writes her dreams down.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.969
- She keeps them in a little book.
- Who's Serena?

32:52.972 --> 32:54.515
What did Carl say?

32:54.682 --> 32:57.101
He says Max ripped us off.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.519
Do you believe him?

32:58.727 --> 33:00.562
Looks that way.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.815
What are we going
to do about it?

33:04.149 --> 33:06.276
Take care of our problem.

33:27.840 --> 33:32.011
Surveillance log, U.S. Treasury field office,
Los Angeles.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.430
Office of attorney Max Waxman,

33:34.596 --> 33:37.266
corner of Walnut
and Los Robles streets.

33:37.433 --> 33:41.687
This is day three,
January 11th, 2200 hours,

33:41.854 --> 33:44.273
reports of Agents Vukovich and Chance.

33:46.442 --> 33:48.485
Looks like he's got a guest.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.738
He must like tall women.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.076
Huh!

33:57.202 --> 33:58.495
What a guy.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.634
What is happening?

34:12.801 --> 34:14.762
Long time, no see.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.435
Heard you were on stage again.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.896
What does Ricky-boy think
about that?

34:45.250 --> 34:48.462
- Quantity?
- 125 grand.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.925
I've seen better.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.969
I'll give you 10 points
for the package.

34:57.179 --> 35:00.140
- Twenty points is the price.
- Where am I gonna get 20 points?

35:00.349 --> 35:03.811
Off the back of a turnip truck?
Tell Rick he can kiss my ass.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.979
Twenty points or I'm out of here.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.272
Hey!

35:12.319 --> 35:14.696
What do you hear from Cody?

35:14.863 --> 35:16.323
Problems.

35:18.534 --> 35:21.912
I know you and Rick had your doubts
about me on this Cody thing

35:22.079 --> 35:24.331
and I want to tell you
I hope that's over with.

35:24.498 --> 35:27.376
I am straight with Rick.
I would never fuck with Rick.

35:27.543 --> 35:30.003
He never talks to me
about his business.

35:30.170 --> 35:35.425
He told me to tell you if you like the paper,
he wants your order. Now.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.719
No problem. That's cool.

35:47.271 --> 35:50.274
I'd love to make a jump
in the rain.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.527
- You ever do any base-jumping?
- Uh-huh.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.988
It's great.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.699
I used to jump off garages
when I was a kid.

36:04.121 --> 36:06.415
Can I bring you something else?

36:06.582 --> 36:09.209
- No, thanks, Father.
- It's great.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.551
Listen, why don't you make a jump
with me sometime?

36:17.718 --> 36:20.888
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you'd love it. It's fabulous.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.765
Once you get over the first fear,
it's a piece of cake.

36:23.932 --> 36:28.437
It's the greatest feeling you'll ever have.
Float out, your balls go into your throat.

36:28.604 --> 36:30.731
I think I'll take a pass, partner.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.775
You know, I could help you

36:33.942 --> 36:36.111
if you ever get in trouble.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.573
- You know what I mean?
- No.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.620
Not here.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.474
I love the rain.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.143
Yeah. It's groovy.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.980
Come on.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.779
Take off your glasses.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.950
Come here.

37:36.046 --> 37:39.341
- How you doing, Max?
- Oh, Christ.

37:39.508 --> 37:42.052
First you rip me off,
then you set up Carl

37:42.219 --> 37:44.471
now you want to fuck my lady.
- Man,

37:44.638 --> 37:46.890
she came on to me, man.
I swear it.

37:47.057 --> 37:49.309
Oh, what a tragedy.

37:49.476 --> 37:52.020
I want my 600 K.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.898
I didn't have anything to do
with getting Cody set up.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.818
Do you know that your house
is under surveillance?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.988
You know you're living like
a fucking animal in the zoo?

38:03.699 --> 38:05.158
Get up!

38:09.788 --> 38:11.707
Stop it.

38:16.420 --> 38:20.215
Open up, Max. Make good
and we'll be friends again.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.019
- Rick! Look out!
- Come here.

38:33.562 --> 38:35.355
He's looking for something. Rick!

38:47.617 --> 38:49.619
Oh, God...

38:56.668 --> 38:58.879
18th-century Cameroon.

39:00.422 --> 39:01.715
Yes.

39:02.758 --> 39:05.552
- Your taste is in your ass.
- No, Jesus, no!

39:24.488 --> 39:26.406
Police!

39:26.573 --> 39:28.450
Police officer!

39:28.617 --> 39:30.077
Open the door!

39:32.329 --> 39:34.915
Police! You inside, open the door!

39:36.625 --> 39:38.418
Open this door! Police!

39:44.841 --> 39:46.676
What's going on?

39:46.843 --> 39:48.136
- Get up!
- What the fuck?

39:48.303 --> 39:50.889
The whole caper's gone. Come on!

39:51.056 --> 39:52.474
Shit!

40:19.042 --> 40:22.045
- What's that?
- I took it out of Waxman's office.

40:23.630 --> 40:25.715
It's some kind of dealer's code.

41:08.842 --> 41:11.761
John, he's got all his delivery dates
in here.

41:11.928 --> 41:15.599
He's got no names,
but he's got amounts, initials.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.602
Look at this: "R.M., R.M."
Every other page.

41:18.768 --> 41:22.355
It's a crime scene. The book is evidence.
What if the cop remembers it's missing?

41:22.522 --> 41:26.193
Shit, that rookie couldn't remember what
he saw. He wasn't in there long enough.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.281
You shouldn't have done it.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.410
What are you trying to tell me, <i>amigo?</i>

41:40.165 --> 41:42.477
Of course if you feel strongly
about it, I'll hand it over.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.101
That's not what I'm saying, OK?
That's not what I'm saying at all.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.132
Just don't put words
in my mouth, all right?

41:49.299 --> 41:51.676
So you won't carry your weight
if something goes down?

41:51.843 --> 41:54.346
We could've got shit-canned
for this little trick.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.973
If you expect me to take heat,
tell me before you do it.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.934
If I had asked,
what would you have said?

41:59.100 --> 42:02.479
That the cops would have let us copy
the diary after it was booked in the evidence.

42:02.646 --> 42:05.440
I wouldn't have done it if I was
with somebody I didn't trust.

42:06.274 --> 42:09.861
Look, I'm no snitch.

42:11.571 --> 42:15.867
Hey, John, Waxman just gave us
Rick Masters on a plate.

How much do I get for the information
I gave you on Waxman?

45:35.650 --> 45:38.445
No arrest, no money.

45:38.611 --> 45:40.238
It's my fault he's dead?

45:40.405 --> 45:42.741
It took me six months
to get next to him.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.284
I've got expenses, you know.

45:44.451 --> 45:46.703
Uncle Sam don't give a shit
about your expenses.

45:46.870 --> 45:49.164
You want bread, fuck a baker.

45:51.833 --> 45:55.044
Someday, some guy I set up
for you is gonna snuff me.

45:55.253 --> 45:58.256
It isn't too hard to figure out
who an informant is.

46:03.136 --> 46:04.721
You gonna stay a while?

46:05.346 --> 46:08.391
No. I gotta go.

46:11.978 --> 46:13.938
I got something for you.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.356
I'm here.

46:20.862 --> 46:23.823
A dealer from San Francisco's
coming into L.A. next week,

46:23.990 --> 46:26.493
with 50 grand
to buy stolen diamonds.

46:26.659 --> 46:29.496
The stuff that was lifted
from the Bel Air Hotel.

46:29.662 --> 46:31.790
He's a Chinaman connected
to people in Hong Kong.

46:31.956 --> 46:34.709
I told you. I'm only interested
in play dough.

46:36.586 --> 46:39.255
I was reading about the stars.

46:39.422 --> 46:43.218
It talked about how the stars
are the eyes of God.

46:43.384 --> 46:45.678
I think it's true, don't you?

46:45.845 --> 46:48.556
No. I don't.

46:51.059 --> 46:54.229
If you had any real balls,
you'd jump off that bridge.

46:58.650 --> 47:02.278
The same thing happened to Max
could happen to me, you know.

47:05.406 --> 47:07.867
Did you hear what I said?

47:08.034 --> 47:09.786
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.040
Can I ask you something?

47:15.375 --> 47:16.918
Sure.

47:18.211 --> 47:20.880
What would you do if I stopped
giving you information?

47:24.300 --> 47:25.802
Why?

47:28.680 --> 47:30.682
I'd just like to know.

47:32.433 --> 47:34.644
I'd have your parole revoked.

47:39.983 --> 47:41.359
You mean that?

47:42.527 --> 47:44.153
You'd do that?

48:20.148 --> 48:22.150
Hey! Hey!

48:32.535 --> 48:33.995
Man, why are you chasing me?

48:34.162 --> 48:35.496
Why are you running?

48:35.663 --> 48:37.582
Because you're chasing me, man!

48:37.749 --> 48:39.000
What do you want?

48:39.167 --> 48:41.586
U.S. Secret Service!

48:41.753 --> 48:43.004
- Get over there!
- OK, OK!

48:43.171 --> 48:44.797
- Against the fence!
- Be cool, man.

48:44.964 --> 48:47.508
Hands over your head, shitbag!
Come on, come on!

48:47.675 --> 48:50.303
Get your hands behind your head!
Turn around!

48:50.511 --> 48:51.763
What the hell is this, huh?

48:51.930 --> 48:53.932
I swear to God, I don't know nothing
about it!

49:17.038 --> 49:19.207
I want to know where Masters prints!

49:22.585 --> 49:24.379
I'm gonna throw your ass
over the bridge!

49:24.545 --> 49:27.173
Talk to me or I throw your ass
over the bridge!

49:27.340 --> 49:29.842
I don't know!
I don't know where he prints!

49:30.009 --> 49:32.679
Nobody does! Nobody, I swear to God!

49:34.889 --> 49:37.767
He was in Terminal Island
when I met him.

49:37.934 --> 49:40.603
He was doing time for armed robbery.

49:40.770 --> 49:45.233
That was, oh, 1978.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.194
I was asked to give a talk
to the inmates,

49:48.361 --> 49:50.488
look at some of their work.

49:51.948 --> 49:55.410
Masters had talent.
You could see that.

49:55.743 --> 50:00.248
I went to his studio one time, and he was
burning a couple of paintings

50:00.415 --> 50:02.750
that I thought were quite beautiful.

50:02.917 --> 50:05.753
Do you think you might know
where that studio was,

50:05.920 --> 50:07.588
remember what it looked like?

50:07.755 --> 50:11.092
That was downtown
past the railroad tracks.

50:11.426 --> 50:13.553
'There's an old warehouse

50:13.720 --> 50:16.097
'and there's a Chinese character on it.'

50:45.793 --> 50:47.420
- Come on!
- Shoot it!

50:48.129 --> 50:49.297
Take your shot!

50:50.423 --> 50:52.425
Yeah!

50:52.675 --> 50:54.844
Not taking
any of that shit, man.

51:09.692 --> 51:13.237
- How did that last stuff go?
- Hell, man, I had it sold within a week.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.615
Needed more, but you changed
the phone numbers.

51:15.782 --> 51:19.410
- I had people begging for them 20s.
- Had to lay low for a while.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.037
That's what I heard.

51:21.204 --> 51:23.414
Heard someone popped your mule
at the airport.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.666
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

51:25.833 --> 51:30.338
He's up in Obispo, and I think he may
try to deal his way out.

51:30.505 --> 51:34.258
- How much of a problem would that be?
- Ain't no big thing.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.344
But ain't nobody
gonna work for free.

51:36.511 --> 51:39.097
- What would it take?
- It'll cost you 100 K in 20s,

51:39.263 --> 51:41.265
if they're as good as the last ones.

51:41.432 --> 51:45.478
Fifty thousand in 100s. It's all I have
on hand at the moment.

51:45.645 --> 51:49.524
Big bills ain't popular in this
neighbourhood, brother. It's gotta be 20s.

51:51.025 --> 51:53.361
Well, I might be able to find

51:53.528 --> 51:57.782
50,000 or so in 20s
lying around somewhere.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.534
Can I ask you something?

51:59.700 --> 52:01.661
As long as you print that shit yourself,

52:01.828 --> 52:05.498
what the hell do you care
if I make 25, 50 or 100 grand?

52:05.665 --> 52:08.167
It'd be nothing but motherfucking paper
to you.

52:10.044 --> 52:11.963
All right, I'll tell you what.

52:12.130 --> 52:17.301
I'll take 75 K in 20s, and I'll personally
guarantee the job.

52:29.564 --> 52:31.399
You still driving that piece of shit?

53:03.097 --> 53:06.434
- Hey, what shit they showing tonight?
- It's that galactical warrior movie.

53:06.601 --> 53:10.146
- I hate that space shit, man.
- It's nothing but science fiction, man.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.323
Hey, what's going down, Reuben?

53:20.489 --> 53:22.575
They're gonna move on somebody.

53:25.119 --> 53:27.747
- Yeah? Somebody getting whacked out?
- Yeah.

53:27.914 --> 53:30.166
Don't know who, huh?

53:30.625 --> 53:32.752
Could be anybody.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.213
Just keep an eye out.

53:35.755 --> 53:38.758
- Am I being hit, man?
- I don't know. It's someone over here.

53:48.893 --> 53:50.061
- Cody!
- Son of a bitch.

53:50.228 --> 53:51.520
You're mine, motherfucker.

53:51.687 --> 53:54.148
- Come here, I got something for your ass.
- It's for you!

53:54.315 --> 53:56.150
Come here! Get him!

53:56.317 --> 53:58.277
Shag his ass!

53:59.028 --> 54:00.988
Hold it! Lay low!

54:03.157 --> 54:05.743
Get off me!

54:05.910 --> 54:07.203
Help me!

54:11.123 --> 54:14.085
- How you doing?
- Hello. Room three.

54:14.252 --> 54:15.836
Thanks.

54:27.223 --> 54:29.433
Pretty girl, Carl.

54:30.184 --> 54:31.310
Actress?

54:35.398 --> 54:38.484
- Stomach problems, huh?
- Ulcer.

54:38.651 --> 54:40.361
Remember me?

54:40.528 --> 54:42.363
Football game at the airport?

54:42.530 --> 54:45.408
They want me to have an operation,
but I can't stand the thought

54:45.574 --> 54:48.160
of one of those prison butchers
slicing me open.

54:48.327 --> 54:51.330
I'd rather drink this shit-pink cement.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.499
I want to get Rick Masters.

54:53.666 --> 54:56.669
I've taken four falls. I never ratted
anybody in my life

54:56.877 --> 54:59.005
and I've had plenty of chances,
believe me.

54:59.171 --> 55:01.674
Masters is your friend.
I don't blame you.

55:01.841 --> 55:05.261
I would never hang up a friend.
Anybody who would is a piece of shit.

55:07.888 --> 55:11.517
The thing is, your friend
tried to have you iced.

55:11.684 --> 55:14.729
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
roll over and play informer.

55:17.690 --> 55:21.068
If you're looking for a pigeon,
go to the park.

55:23.738 --> 55:25.364
Look, I'll tell you what.

55:25.573 --> 55:29.702
You help me, I'll get to a judge,
have your sentence reduced to a parole,

55:29.869 --> 55:32.413
get you the fuck out of here.

55:32.580 --> 55:34.707
What would I have to do?

55:35.583 --> 55:37.710
- Like, exactly.
- Simple.

55:37.877 --> 55:41.756
Show me where you print
and testify against him in open court.

55:43.924 --> 55:48.387
I'd rather stay here the rest of my life
than testify in open court.

55:53.267 --> 55:55.978
Then you better lock your cell door
and throw away the key

55:56.145 --> 55:58.356
because I cannot take care
of you in here.

56:22.588 --> 56:26.133
I got all it takes, brother.
Yo, yo, yo, yo...

56:27.051 --> 56:29.470
Hello, Jeff.

56:30.763 --> 56:32.473
What are you doing in my crib?

56:36.268 --> 56:39.939
You sent two assholes to do Cody,
and they blew it.

56:40.106 --> 56:42.942
I paid you half. I want it back.

56:43.109 --> 56:44.652
Yeah, well...

56:44.819 --> 56:47.863
I'm trying to get
that money back myself.

56:48.030 --> 56:51.700
I had to front the whole purchase
to get my people to do their thing,

56:51.867 --> 56:54.203
so I ain't got any more.

56:54.370 --> 57:00.418
Well, then you better try and shit 40 grand,
because I ain't leaving without it.

57:01.919 --> 57:03.629
I owe you, Cody.

57:03.963 --> 57:05.756
Next time, there'll be no fuckup.

57:05.923 --> 57:07.716
What next time?

57:07.883 --> 57:10.136
He's in protective custody.

57:10.970 --> 57:12.513
Hell...

57:12.680 --> 57:15.266
Protective custody
don't mean shit to me.

57:15.474 --> 57:17.560
The man's dead.

57:22.731 --> 57:24.608
In a pig's ass.

57:27.653 --> 57:30.614
I want my paper, Jeff.

57:30.823 --> 57:33.951
I can't afford to have it
circulating right now.

57:38.330 --> 57:41.459
And I told you I don't have it.

57:41.667 --> 57:42.960
Get it.

57:45.504 --> 57:46.964
Now, look, my man,

57:48.674 --> 57:52.136
I told you I don't have
what you're looking for,

57:52.344 --> 57:54.680
so why don't you
make it easy on yourself

57:55.389 --> 57:57.850
and just shag your ass
out of my crib.

57:58.142 --> 57:59.894
Now, you be a printer.

58:01.061 --> 58:03.522
Go get some ink

58:03.689 --> 58:05.858
and start printing
some more of that shit.

58:07.318 --> 58:09.361
What's happening, fella?

58:10.696 --> 58:11.906
Yeah, you, asshole!

58:20.664 --> 58:22.958
What are you gonna do now,
motherfucker?

58:32.259 --> 58:33.844
Goddamn it!

58:35.596 --> 58:38.682
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Don't! Don't!

58:40.434 --> 58:43.062
- Fuck...
- You broke your contract with me, Jeff.

58:43.229 --> 58:46.190
Now, I don't know
whether you're into it,

58:46.357 --> 58:51.028
but you're gonna have to suck on this
until you give me back my paper.

59:04.083 --> 59:06.752
- How much are you gonna burn?
- All of it.

59:06.919 --> 59:08.420
Why?

59:09.338 --> 59:12.049
No good to me
after they handled it.

59:52.298 --> 59:56.051
- What do you want?
- I got a writ I need you to sign.

59:56.218 --> 59:57.303
What kind of writ?

59:57.469 --> 01:00:00.514
I need the release of a prisoner
from San Luis to help me in a case.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:03.475
- Must be a big case.
- The target's a major counterfeiter

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:07.980
- involved in the murder of a federal agent.
- I never sign such writs.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.279
Why are you still here?

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.449
I spent all morning on this.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:21.493
I would appreciate it if you would be
kind enough to look at it.

01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:27.499
OK. Now I've looked at it.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.002
Look, I gotta have this guy out.

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:35.507
Didn't you come in here about a week ago
and ask me to hold him without bail?

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:38.510
Yes, and I'll assume full responsibility
for getting him back.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:42.264
I don't need the headache.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:44.099
Cody is an associate of Rick Masters.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:47.436
Masters has been making a mockery out
of you, me and this whole system.

01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:51.398
That doesn't change the fact that he's on
a no-bail hold awaiting arraignment.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.946
He killed my partner, man.

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:03.869
The answer is still no.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.379
If I was one of your cronies,

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:16.465
you'd be spread-eagle on your desk
to do this for me.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:23.055
Don't say something you'll regret later.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.891
Come back here!

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.067
Let me look at it again.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:54.628
If this prisoner escapes from custody,

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:58.882
I'll make you testify in open court
about how he made a fool out of you.

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:08.559
Now get the hell out of here.

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:14.648
If you cross me, I will dedicate
my life to putting you back in here

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:17.276
and I will pull every string
to make sure you do all five.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:18.839
- You got that?
- You have my promise.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:22.197
I wanna know where Masters prints
and I want you to take me there now.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:24.950
Then we're going downtown
to swear out your statement.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.578
- Can I ask a favour?
- What?

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.706
My daughter's in the hospital.
She's pretty sick.

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:34.918
Do you think we could stop by
Santa Fe Hospital?

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.546
It's on the way
to where I'm taking you.

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:40.632
- You're pulling my dick.
- I swear, man. Check it out.

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.760
- What's your daughter's name?
- Rozanne Brown.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:47.097
Lincoln 14-3-1
to Los Angeles base, over.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.100
'Go ahead, 3-1.'

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.478
Yeah. Request you phone
Santa Fe Hospital.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.940
Find out if they have a patient
named Rozanne Brown, please. Over.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.484
'Roger.'

01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:05.407
- You have any kids?
- Uh-huh.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:09.578
Well, I tell you, it changes
the way you look at things.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:10.788
Yeah?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.166
I'm not looking to screw up anymore.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.670
Rozanne Brown is in room 306.
The elevators are over there.

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:19.838
Thank you.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.806
You have to come up
to the room with me?

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:39.274
Come here.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.747
- What happened to your daughter?
- She was in a park, and this little monkey...

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.887
Rozanne Brown is a black woman.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:12.641
She's recuperating from a fall
she took from a bicycle near USC.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:16.687
She's married. Her husband is listed
as serving time

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.731
for armed robbery
at San Luis Obispo Prison.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:20.983
Thanks.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:23.694
I think you ought to let us
take a look at you.

01:04:41.253 --> 01:04:43.797
I don't have a lot of time.
I'm in the middle of a trial.

01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:46.425
- What kind of trial?
- It's a dope case.

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:49.595
A client got busted smuggling
50 pounds of cocaine.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.389
I should be able to get him off.
The search warrant's weak.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.099
Weak?

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:56.935
The colour of the house is listed as brown
on the warrant

01:04:57.102 --> 01:05:00.397
when, in fact, it's beige and yellow.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:02.190
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:05.068
I don't make any apologies
for being an attorney.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:08.405
If I didn't accept the case, somebody else
would without a doubt.

01:05:08.614 --> 01:05:10.240
Without a doubt.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.247
It's too bad about Jim Hart.

01:05:23.462 --> 01:05:26.089
Masters has been calling me
in the middle of the night

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:30.052
trying to order me around
like I was one of his mules.

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:33.347
The other day he even had
the balls to threaten me.

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:35.223
The man's an animal.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:37.976
Frankly, being house counsel
for Rick Masters

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.437
doesn't sit very well with me.

01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:42.773
I've had it up to here,
as a matter of fact.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.441
Good for you.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.572
How bad do you and your friend
want him?

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.496
I don't have to explain
what would happen

01:05:57.663 --> 01:06:00.499
if there was even a hint that
I set up one of my own clients.

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:03.335
Aren't you afraid
you'll wind up on his hit list?

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:07.297
- It crossed my mind.
- Your name will never come up.

01:06:07.506 --> 01:06:10.509
- You never met Rick, have you?
- No.

01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:12.302
I'll set up a meeting.

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.227
Mr. Masters?

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:24.773
How you doing? Ben Jessup.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.859
- My associate, Dr. George Victor.
- A pleasure. How do you do?

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:30.070
Cut yourself shaving,
Mr. Jessup?

01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:33.699
No. As a matter of fact,
I got hit by a tennis ball.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:36.702
- You're in from Palm Springs, huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:39.079
- What's the weather like there?
- It's really nice.

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:41.289
We've been up here
the last few days.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:45.585
I've got a friend in Palm Springs,
Lenny Green.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:49.339
He owns the Oasis.
Do you know him?

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:52.426
I got a friend in Hollywood,
Donald Duck. You know him?

01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:57.389
I understand you gentlemen
do some island banking.

01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:58.890
- That's right.
- Where?

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:00.142
Cayman Islands.

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:02.519
- Good business?
- Not bad.

01:07:02.728 --> 01:07:04.438
What sort of banking?

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.648
We're a Dutch Antilles company.

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:09.735
We loan money to various
enterprises here in the States.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.863
Loans aren't secured by real estate
or anything else down there.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.365
Hey, Rick, you got a phone call, man.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.916
Which one is it?

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.544
There's nothing in there.

01:07:27.753 --> 01:07:30.047
Some tennis rackets
in the trunk,

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.924
men's clothing with Palm Springs
store labels,

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:37.220
some business letters with return
addresses in the Cayman Islands.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.847
What did the letters say?

01:07:39.014 --> 01:07:42.559
Something about "Please forward the stock
we discussed," or something like that.

01:07:42.768 --> 01:07:44.895
Who were the letters addressed to?

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:47.898
Caribbean Banking Unlimited,
Dutch Antilles.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:52.069
Did you notice the names Jessup
or Victor on any of the letters?

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:54.863
- No.
- OK.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.698
Thanks.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.909
What kind of paper
are we talking about?

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:02.245
Hundreds and 50s paper. We need
at least 10 different serial numbers.

01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:05.290
- How much?
- A million dollars.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:11.630
How you going to use it?

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:14.007
What business is that of yours?

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.803
It's always my business,
Mr. Jessup.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.765
Nothing will be passed up here.

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:27.312
Our play involves a gentleman who wishes
to launder bonds, protect his tax position.

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:30.774
My end is 20 percent.

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:34.444
We never pay more than 10. We have
limitations that we have to abide by.

01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:38.281
Different serial numbers are
a real pain in the ass for me.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:42.953
I gotta make different plates and wear
rubber gloves during the whole operation.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:46.581
Have you ever tried to work
with rubber gloves on?

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.875
Fifteen percent.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.586
I don't negotiate.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.005
I might if I knew you, but I don't.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.299
And I don't like what I see.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.011
All right.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.808
I start as soon as
I get a down payment.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:08.353
In this case, I'll take
30,000 up front

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.438
- and the rest on delivery.
- What?

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:15.318
Everybody knows Rick Masters
won't go near a job without front money.

01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:20.240
You should also know that I've never
fucked a customer out of his front money.

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:25.953
I've been coming to this gym three
or four times a week for five years.

01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:30.917
I'm an easy man to find.
My reputation speaks for itself.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:35.046
The fact is, that if you can't
come up with the front money,

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.006
you're not for real.

01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:42.053
'No way I can get you
30 K to make a buy.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.346
You'd hear laughter
all the way from Washington.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.017
Masters beats the government
out of that much in a day.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:50.395
We've got a chance for a hand-to-hand
buy which he cannot beat in court.

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:53.356
You're not the first agents
to get next to Masters.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.192
He always asks for big front money.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.819
Nobody ever approves it,
and he stays on the street.

01:09:57.986 --> 01:10:00.488
The limit for buys is 10 grand.
I don't make the rules.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.408
Look, you could get this
approved if you wanted to.

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:06.703
302.5.

01:10:06.912 --> 01:10:09.372
- What?
- 302.5.

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:13.627
You violated section 302.5.
The manual says:

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.796
"The agents must notify
the agent in charge"

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.925
that's me, "of all
ongoing investigations."

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:22.802
You violated this section, and
I'm not gonna cover your ass.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:26.473
- Yeah, well, I'm not asking you to.
- You lost a federal prisoner!

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.725
- And I want Cody back!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:30.447
- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:33.021
- He wasn't with me, all right?
- Why not?

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:35.523
Look, I lost him.
I'll get him back.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.692
Thank you, Gilbert.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.779
I think we should have offered
Masters the 10 grand.

01:10:40.946 --> 01:10:43.782
- I bet he'd have gone for it.
- Never happen, Johnny.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.294
Let me try something on you.

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:57.754
Yeah, what?

01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:01.132
Ruth tells me there's a guy coming in
Thursday to buy stolen diamonds.

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:03.927
He's gonna be carrying
$50,000 cash.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.471
So?

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.682
So, what do you think?

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.268
What do I think about what?

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:15.981
The guy comes in Thursday,
Union Station.

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:17.315
No muss, no fuss.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.122
If everything doesn't look like
a piece of cake, we just walk away.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.700
- Jesus! You gotta be kidding.
- When you came to me, I told you

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:30.120
that I was gonna get Masters
and I didn't give a shit how I did it.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:33.498
- So now you want to commit a robbery?
- I wouldn't call it that.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:34.708
What would you call it?

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:37.836
Taking down a douche bag
who's trying to break the law.

01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:40.880
- If it turns to shit?
- We say, "Fuck it," walk away.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:45.719
Look, the front money is the only way
to get Masters to print.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:48.388
I don't give a shit. I won't pull a heist.
I don't care.

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:50.315
- The guy's a fence.
- Who do you think I am?

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.517
If he gets ripped off,
he can't call the police.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:56.062
Why don't you just blow his brains out?
That's what you want to do anyway.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.523
All I'm asking you to do is drive the car.

01:11:58.857 --> 01:12:02.193
Steal real money to buy counterfeit
money? How's that gonna look in court?

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:04.654
- His word against ours.
- His lawyer is Bob Grimes.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:08.241
- It's Masters' word against ours.
- You got a couple of screws loose, pal.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:14.372
Listen, I say we go to Bateman
one more time.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:17.334
Oh, fuck Bateman. He's a pencil-neck.
He's out to save his ass.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.461
I think you're pushing it too fast. We can...

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.963
It's happening Thursday.
We gotta go down in 24 hours.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.382
My father was a cop, brother's a cop.
You're ask...

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:25.884
Give me a break!

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:28.303
You got the wrong guy, OK?
You got the wrong guy.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:32.432
You're right I got the wrong guy, pal.
You ain't my partner.

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:35.685
You ain't even my fucking friend.
Let me give you a piece of advice:

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.354
You better get into protection,

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.148
because you ain't shit on
the street, you understand?

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:41.941
You ain't got the nuts!

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:43.526
Kiss my ass!

01:13:28.113 --> 01:13:30.156
All I know is what I told you.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:34.786
He's on the number 11 Amtrak leaving
San Francisco 7:00 in the morning,

01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:37.288
getting into Union Station
at 4:35.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.751

You wrote it down or what?

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.340
Who's the seller?

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:49.968
A guy I know.

01:13:50.135 --> 01:13:53.012
What did this guy you know
tell you?

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.932
That a Chinaman comes down

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:59.060
buys diamonds, gold, whatever.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:00.562

- Nothing. Just a guy I know tells me things.
- A guy you know.

A guy you know actually gives you
the train the buyer's coming in on?

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.996
Of course not.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.498
I called Amtrak
and got his reservation.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.626
Why?

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.378

Thought about it.

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:57.368
- Why are you suddenly interested?
- It fits some other shit that's happening.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.621
- You gonna bag him?
- I might.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:03.166

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:34.959
Oh, no!

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:44.927
Get out of the way!

01:27:48.389 --> 01:27:50.432
God, no!

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:07.157
'There's a minor tie-up on the north
Long Beach right near Henry Ford.

01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:10.995
'A couple cars tangled there. Shouldn't
take too long to get this to the shoulder.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.664
'It's a very simple affair,
no injuries involved.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:17.376
'It shouldn't cost more than a few minutes
if you're heading north on the 710.

01:28:17.543 --> 01:28:20.296
'I'm Stacey Binn
for Metro Traffic Control.'

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:01.920
What are we gonna do?!

01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:06.216
We're going to an auto-parts
store and get a new window.

01:29:07.343 --> 01:29:09.470
If we'd have totaled it,
we'd have been screwed.

01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:11.847
We'd never have gotten it back
to the motor pool.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:14.600
We lucked out, Johnny!
We lucked out!

01:29:24.902 --> 01:29:25.903
Yeah.

01:29:26.904 --> 01:29:27.905
Mmh-mmh.

01:29:34.495 --> 01:29:37.081
Listen, I'll have to get back to you, OK?

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.754
- What happened? I called you all day.
- Clockwork, baby.

01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:46.423
Like fucking clockwork.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.093
Did you hear anything?

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:51.762
My friend called. He said
the Chinaman never showed up.

01:29:51.929 --> 01:29:53.138
He sure didn't.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.725
God, 50,000 bucks.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:59.186
Fuck. Quintin Dailey got 30 points,
they said.

01:29:59.353 --> 01:30:03.023
That guy's unbelievable, man. Say all you
want about Michael Jordan. Great player.

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:05.192
They'll know somebody
set the Chinaman up.

01:30:05.359 --> 01:30:07.820
Quintin Dailey's
got a gun like a howitzer, man.

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:10.155
Thirty feet. Boom, boom, boom.

01:30:10.364 --> 01:30:13.075
He gets hot, he's fabulous.
Fucking Orlando Woolridge...

01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:16.078
I'm worried. I'm worried!

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:26.505
The stars are God's eyes.

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:46.233
What's the matter with you?

01:30:52.656 --> 01:30:56.702
The last item on the agenda
is a bulletin from the FBI.

01:30:56.910 --> 01:31:00.747
"On January 24th, FBI
Special Agent Raymond Fong

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:04.543
"of the bureau of San Francisco
field office was kidnapped and robbed

01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:07.004
"of $50,000 in government funds.

01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:10.048
"Fong, who was acting
in an undercover capacity

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.843
"as part of a bureau-sponsored
sting operation

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:17.139
"was abducted and murdered
shortly after arriving at Union Station.

01:31:17.306 --> 01:31:21.810
"The suspects are described as white males,
30 to 35 years old,

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:24.646
"one with black, the other
with brown hair.

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:29.860
"They eluded Fong's covering agents
and fled in a beige, late-model Chevrolet.

01:31:30.027 --> 01:31:31.528
"Anyone having information,

01:31:31.737 --> 01:31:35.115
"contact the special agent
in charge, FBI, San Francisco."

01:31:35.282 --> 01:31:39.161
- Is there a license on the vehicle?
- There's no plates on the vehicle.

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:44.416
This is what happens when proper
covering procedures are not followed.

01:31:45.459 --> 01:31:47.586
We got an FBI agent killed.
You hear that?

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:51.548
- What do you want me to do about it?
- It's just a matter of time before they ID us.

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:54.051
- They got a good look.
- A face is shit without a name.

01:31:54.218 --> 01:31:56.011
They got a make on the car!

01:31:56.178 --> 01:32:01.266
They wouldn't have sent it out if they
had anything. They're grabbing at shit.

01:32:01.475 --> 01:32:04.561
Oh, Jesus. So, what are we
gonna do about the 50 grand?

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:07.314
We'll make the buy from Masters,
just like we planned.

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:12.528
Are you out of your fucking mind
or something?

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:15.489
Ray. Hey, I want
a standup ashtray.

01:32:15.656 --> 01:32:18.408
These guys are stealing
all of my ashtrays.

01:32:21.245 --> 01:32:23.205
Just like we planned, <i>amigo.</i>

01:32:46.937 --> 01:32:48.522
Over here.

01:32:56.947 --> 01:32:58.949
Who are they?

01:32:59.157 --> 01:33:00.534
Who are you?

01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:02.411
This is Mr. Jessup,

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:05.539
whose name isn't really Jessup.

01:33:05.706 --> 01:33:09.793
He says he's from Palm Springs,
but doesn't have a tan.

01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:14.089
You're not wired, are you?

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:20.637
Is this my package?

01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:33.442
Look OK?

01:33:42.075 --> 01:33:43.869
You're beautiful.

01:33:46.705 --> 01:33:48.665
When do I get delivery?

01:33:50.584 --> 01:33:53.629
How about Friday night?

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:56.590
If I don't hear from you by Friday
I'm coming back to get this.

01:33:56.757 --> 01:33:58.634
That's understandable.

01:34:00.427 --> 01:34:01.970
Oh, Mr. Jessup...

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:07.225
Like your work?

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:32.292
Your only defence is to say
you were working undercover

01:34:32.459 --> 01:34:34.878
without the knowledge
of your supervisors.

01:34:35.045 --> 01:34:38.131
You were trying to get next to Masters
and things got out of hand

01:34:38.298 --> 01:34:40.759
and you intended
to return the money.

01:34:40.926 --> 01:34:43.178
The problem is, you'll have
to take the witness stand

01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:46.682
and the prosecutor
can ask you anything he wants.

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:50.102
Frankly, I don't think
you can beat the case in court.

01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:55.357
Because I represent Masters
I can't get deeply involved in your case,

01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:58.568
- if you see what I mean.
- So, what should I do?

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:02.155
You beat them to the punch with
the U.S. Attorney and you make a deal.

01:35:02.322 --> 01:35:03.532
What kind of deal?

01:35:03.699 --> 01:35:07.828
You offer to plead guilty and
to testify against your partner.

01:35:07.994 --> 01:35:11.081
The FBI's not gonna want
a lot of publicity on this.

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:14.000
I suspect they'll go along
with a guilty plea.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:18.630
How much time
would I have to do?

01:35:18.797 --> 01:35:21.091
I could probably get you off
with seven years.

01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:24.469
You won't have to do seven,
of course. Probably a year and a half.

01:35:26.138 --> 01:35:29.725
- But you can't get involved, right?
- Not directly.

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:36.189
What would it cost
for your indirect involvement?

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:38.316
Fifty thousand dollars.

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:47.492
I know it's a tough call,

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:50.996
but it's one you're going
to have to make rather quickly.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:56.752
I can't hand up my partner.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:03.383
I can't do it, even if I have to go
to the joint.

01:36:46.343 --> 01:36:48.553
Who is it?

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.888
Who's there?

01:37:07.239 --> 01:37:08.782
Honey?

01:37:45.443 --> 01:37:46.987
Shit, you OK, Carl?

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:51.575
- Guess we all screw up, huh, Carl?
- How did you find me?

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:54.619
Your bimbo girlfriend's listed
in the Screen Actors directory.

01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:58.123
- Carl, I swear I never saw this guy!
- Sit down, Claudia, and shut up!

01:37:58.290 --> 01:37:59.749
You know, you're a lucky man.

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:02.711
I didn't tell the judge
you played hooky on me.

01:38:02.878 --> 01:38:04.754
Now you're gonna help me,
aren't you, Carl?

01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:07.632
Come on, asshole, let's go.
Move!

01:38:20.312 --> 01:38:22.272
Hi. Is Chance there?

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:27.319
I want to talk to Chance.

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:31.323
Is this 471-4421?

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:33.450
This is John Vukovich. Where is he?

01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:36.578
There's no one here
by that name.

01:38:36.745 --> 01:38:38.496
Who is it?

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:40.916
John Vukovich.

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:43.001
John.

01:38:43.168 --> 01:38:45.503
Listen, I got Cody back.
I know where the plant is.

01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:49.215
We gotta talk. We gotta go to Bateman.
I can't live with this any longer.

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:52.385
'I talked to Masters. We're on tonight.'

01:38:52.552 --> 01:38:56.681
- What are you talking about?
- 'We're on, with Masters tonight.'

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.825
- Do you need me tonight?
- No, I don't think so.

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.955
What time do you get off?

01:39:20.121 --> 01:39:21.915
- About 12:30.
- OK.

01:39:22.082 --> 01:39:27.921
I got a few things to do, and then
I'll drop by and pick you up at the club.

01:39:28.088 --> 01:39:30.215
All right?

01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:31.883
You look beautiful.

01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:43.436

a wire on there, brother.

- Let's see that bag.
- You don't touch me.

01:41:07.062 --> 01:41:09.272
- Look, dickhead!
- Keep your hands off me.

a lot of money.

Maybe he burned them.

you stayed with him so long.
