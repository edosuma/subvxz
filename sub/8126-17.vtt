Can I help you?

I've had something of his

That's very nice of you.

Hey, ma,
what a cute little boy.
Where did he come from?

02:43.929 --> 02:47.165
I don't know.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.668
I-I mean, I do know.
Oh, he came through
the front door.

he came from.
Huh?

Will you help me
fix the dinner, Gloria?

No. I wanna know
who the little boy is.

Hi there, big fella.
Who are you? Hey, ma,
who does he belong to?

Oh, ma, look at that.

he looks just like Michael.

No! No--

I mean,
Mike has a mustache.
Yeah.

03:30.075 --> 03:32.443

You are hungry,
aren't you?

03:35.781 --> 03:38.349
You see, Gloria?
He's starved.

03:38.417 --> 03:40.384
Come on, dear.
Sit over here,

03:40.452 --> 03:42.753

out in the kitchen

03:42.822 --> 03:45.290
A nice peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

But, ma, he just said
he wasn't hungry.

What's he doin' there?

05:04.403 --> 05:06.437
He's eatin' a sandwich.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.574
Mike, why don't you
go upstairs?

some studying to do,
haven't you?

Oh, no. I'll wait
till after dinner.

Hey, you know, he's cute.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.218
Hey, you know who
he reminds me of?
Nobody!

05:21.787 --> 05:24.488
I mean,
nobody in your family.

05:24.556 --> 05:27.425
Oh, no.
No, that's good!

05:27.492 --> 05:29.827
No, he reminds me
of one of the guys
from school.

05:29.895 --> 05:32.130
Hey, ma, you never did say
who his mother was.

05:32.197 --> 05:34.132
Didn't I?

05:34.199 --> 05:37.201
I'd better go see
how the dinner's doin'
in the oven.

05:37.269 --> 05:39.570
It's doin' fine. I checked.
Who's his mother?

05:39.638 --> 05:42.807
Oh! Then I'd better
go upstairs
and make the beds.

05:42.874 --> 05:45.143
<i>Uh, you made them</i>
<i>this morning, ma.</i>
<i>Did I?</i>

05:45.210 --> 05:49.213
Yes. Who's his mother?
What is the matter, ma?

05:49.281 --> 05:51.749
There's a strange little boy
in the room, and all
we wanna know is who he is.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.751
Yeah.
Who is he?

05:53.819 --> 05:57.088
Well, why are you askin' me
so many questions?

05:57.156 --> 05:59.424
So there's a little boy
in the room.

05:59.491 --> 06:02.860
Is there anything wrong about
having a little boy in the room?

06:02.928 --> 06:06.030
Is there a law against having
a little boy in the room?

06:06.098 --> 06:09.000
It's nice having
a little boy in the room.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.803
And if you want me to answer
any more questions,
don't ask me!

06:21.246 --> 06:23.414
Gloria, what's with her?
I don't know.

06:23.482 --> 06:27.452
Well, stuck on the subway
for 30 minutes again tonight.

06:27.519 --> 06:29.720
Arch, uh--
let me tell you
somethin'.

06:29.788 --> 06:33.491
The way your mayor Lindsay
runs the city's
transportation system,

06:33.558 --> 06:35.960
a workin' man
can get home for supper
around breakfast time.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.962
Look, arch--
daddy--

06:38.030 --> 06:40.999
I'll say one thing
for mussolini.

06:41.066 --> 06:44.268
He was no bundle of laughs,
but he sure could make
a train run on time.

06:44.336 --> 06:46.871
Look, arch, uh--

06:46.938 --> 06:49.907
wait. Ho.
Hey, hold your horses.
Hey, who's this here?

06:49.975 --> 06:52.176
Yeah, that's what we were
tryin' to tell you, arch.

06:52.244 --> 06:55.079
Well, go ahead
and tell me, meathead.
What's with the kid?

06:55.147 --> 06:58.149
Well, we don't know.
Mom said somebody
brought him here.

06:58.217 --> 07:03.654
I didn't think he grew like
a mushroom out of the chair.
Who brought him?

07:03.722 --> 07:06.424
Little boy, I brought you
a nice glass of milk--

07:06.492 --> 07:09.360
oh, Archie,
you're home!

07:15.300 --> 07:18.403
No, Edith,
I'm still at work.

07:18.470 --> 07:23.174
What you see standin' here
is merely a pigment
of your imagination.

07:23.242 --> 07:27.645
Edith, who is this kid--
Archie, I need
to talk to you.

07:27.712 --> 07:30.481
What? Gee, uh, who's
the little kid here?

07:30.549 --> 07:33.817
That's just what I wanted
to talk to you about.

07:33.885 --> 07:36.120
Well, whoop-Dee-do.

07:36.188 --> 07:39.857
First time in 23 years our
minds are "synchrosized."

07:41.393 --> 07:43.428
Who's the child?

07:43.495 --> 07:45.729
He's-- he's--

07:45.797 --> 07:48.966
oh, Archie,
we got trouble.

07:50.569 --> 07:54.405
Can't you answer me
a simple,
three-word question?

07:54.473 --> 07:56.407
Who is that kid?

07:57.976 --> 08:00.144
What's the big mystery?

08:00.212 --> 08:04.282
Oh, Mike!
Oh, Archie!

08:05.717 --> 08:07.651
Oh, Gloria!

08:09.121 --> 08:12.123
Oh, Edith!

08:12.191 --> 08:14.125
What is it?

08:14.193 --> 08:17.328
Well, you see,

08:17.396 --> 08:21.199
the bell rang, and I--
and I went and answered
the door,

08:21.266 --> 08:23.767
and there was
this woman there.

08:23.835 --> 08:25.936
Yeah?

08:28.073 --> 08:31.775
And she left the little boy
and sort of ran away.

08:31.843 --> 08:34.212
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that...

08:34.279 --> 08:37.115
Some woman showed up here
at the door
you've never seen before,

08:37.182 --> 08:39.950
you don't even know,
and left the child here?

08:40.018 --> 08:42.587
Edith, I mean,
you don't know the person.

08:42.654 --> 08:44.855
Maybe that person
could be a kidnapper.

08:44.923 --> 08:48.326
That would make you
an "accessidy"
after the fact.

08:48.393 --> 08:50.995
- Ma, are you sure
it was her son?
- Oh, yeah.

08:51.062 --> 08:53.598
I'm sure
it was her son.
Well, how are you sure?

08:53.665 --> 08:57.201
Did she tell you that?
No, not exactly.

08:57.269 --> 08:59.069
Ma, what exactly
did she tell you?

09:02.174 --> 09:05.443
She told me
it was <i>your</i> son, Mike.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.383
What?
What?

09:12.451 --> 09:14.118
What?

09:14.186 --> 09:16.387
What?

09:16.455 --> 09:20.224
She asked for
Michael stivic
and just left him here.

09:20.292 --> 09:23.628
Ma, you have
to be kidding!

09:25.597 --> 09:29.133
- She better be kiddin'!
- Michael!

09:29.201 --> 09:31.602
That's your son there?
Michael?

09:31.670 --> 09:35.540
No, no!
Of course he's not
my son, Gloria.

09:35.607 --> 09:39.843
Get your hands
off my daughter,
you palooka,

09:39.911 --> 09:43.681
and head for
the Y.M.C.A.!

09:43.748 --> 09:48.319
Daddy-- daddy, calm down.
I'm sure Michael has
a reasonable explanation.

09:48.387 --> 09:52.022
Michael, tell daddy
your reasonable explanation.

09:53.258 --> 09:55.193
Well, I mean,
it's obvious...

09:55.260 --> 09:57.728
Some nut left a kid
on our doorstep,
that's all.

09:57.796 --> 10:00.398
No, no!
That ain't all!

10:00.465 --> 10:03.767
That kid was left
special delivery
for Michael stivic!

10:03.835 --> 10:06.937
There can't be more than
one of them in this world.

10:07.005 --> 10:10.374
Archie, all that proves
is that whoever this nut is,
she knows my name.

10:10.442 --> 10:12.810
I mean, haven't
you ever gotten anything
you didn't ask for?

10:20.586 --> 10:22.520
I'm lookin' right at it.

10:24.389 --> 10:26.857
Look, uh, Archie,
that kid--

10:26.925 --> 10:29.126
I mean, I would know if
I had a son, wouldn't I?

10:29.194 --> 10:31.395
I mean, look at that kid!
He doesn't even look like me!

10:31.463 --> 10:35.065
Except a little
when he pouts.
Ma, please!

10:36.568 --> 10:40.137
Daddy-- daddy,
Michael's right.
It's obviously a big mistake.

10:40.205 --> 10:42.873
Of course it's a mistake!
It always is!

10:44.509 --> 10:48.078
This is a mistake that he made
I figure about four years ago.

10:48.146 --> 10:52.416
And look at this.
His mistake is gettin'
peanut butter all over my chair!

10:52.484 --> 10:55.986
I'll get it off.
Oh, he has it on his face.

10:56.054 --> 10:57.921
Have you got a hankie?

10:57.989 --> 11:00.157
Michael, what are
we gonna do?
Uh-- uh--

11:00.225 --> 11:02.092
I'll call the
child welfare bureau.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.328
Why would anybody
do a thing like this?

11:04.396 --> 11:06.530
Who knows, Gloria?
Some stupid reason.

11:06.598 --> 11:09.867
Look. Here's a picture
of the little boy.

11:09.934 --> 11:12.803
We don't need
no picture of him, Edith.
We can see what he looks like.

11:12.871 --> 11:15.306
He's standin'
with his mother.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.577
Oh. His mother's
very attractive.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.179
Uh, I wanna report
a child leaving.

11:22.247 --> 11:24.948
Uh, a child leaving.
Uh--

11:25.016 --> 11:27.885
no, no, I don't mean
the child left.
The child is here.

11:27.952 --> 11:31.221
The mother left.
Uh-- yes, I'll hold on.

11:31.290 --> 11:35.526
Michael, here's a picture
of his mother.
Do you recognize her?

11:35.594 --> 11:38.296
Gloria, if I thought
for one second...

11:38.363 --> 11:40.331
That that boy was my son--

11:45.870 --> 11:48.205
that's Marilyn Sanders.

12:00.185 --> 12:02.052
<i>I mean, I don't</i>
<i>understand it, Michael.</i>

12:02.120 --> 12:06.524
In all the time we've been
together, you never ever once
even mentioned Marilyn Sanders.

12:06.591 --> 12:08.526

on me again?

No, Gloria.
What makes you think that?

12:14.933 --> 12:18.502
I've heard every word
you've said... all night.

<i>Michael, look at me.</i>
<i>Hmm?</i>

12:23.408 --> 12:26.143
- We have some more
talking to do.
- More talking?

12:26.211 --> 12:30.981
Gloria, it's 5:30 in the
morning. You've said everything
there is to say... twice.

12:31.049 --> 12:33.183
You miserable creep.

12:33.251 --> 12:35.619
You said that three times.

You're not funny, papa!

12:37.689 --> 12:39.790
Ohh!

12:39.858 --> 12:43.828
Don't say that, Gloria!
Don't say that!
You have no right to say that!

12:43.895 --> 12:46.697
And you have no right
to be that!

12:46.765 --> 12:48.699
Gloria--
well, it's true,
isn't it?

12:48.767 --> 12:50.701
I don't know if it's true!

12:50.769 --> 12:53.103
But Marilyn Sanders knows,
doesn't she?

12:53.171 --> 12:56.173
Gloria,
I tried to reach her.
Her phone was disconnected.

12:56.241 --> 12:59.042
There was no address.
There's no way
I can contact her!

12:59.110 --> 13:00.811
I thought you'd
already done that.

13:00.879 --> 13:04.014
Oh, that--
you!

13:04.082 --> 13:07.752
Even if it's true, Gloria,
I'm a human being,
and human beings make mistakes!

13:07.819 --> 13:12.690
But most people's mistakes
don't walk in the front door
and say, "hi, daddy!"

13:12.758 --> 13:15.125
Will you listen
to yourself, Gloria?

13:15.193 --> 13:18.962
You sound like queen Victoria!
What happened to the modern,
liberated girl I married?

13:19.030 --> 13:22.566
She became a mother
by special delivery!

13:22.634 --> 13:26.837
Look, Gloria, that--
that boy,
he can't be my son.

13:26.905 --> 13:29.172
I mean, it's practically
impossible.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.342
The odds are all against it.
You went out with her,
didn't you?

13:32.411 --> 13:35.513
Well, yeah.
I knew her,
but not that well.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.382
It--
it was only once.

13:38.450 --> 13:41.351
If I remember
my biology right,
once is enough.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.721

I don't care
where it happened!

13:52.664 --> 13:55.165
I just wanna know
why you didn't marry her.

13:55.233 --> 13:58.035
Because I didn't love her!
Then how
could you take her--

13:58.102 --> 14:00.037
because I liked her.

14:05.944 --> 14:08.045
She was... pretty.

14:09.147 --> 14:11.482

Oh, come on, now,
Gloria.

You know I didn't
mean it that way.

Michael, that's not
what I mean.

Do I have to
spell it out for you?

14:31.035 --> 14:34.104

On that subject,

Hey, before we met,
that doesn't count.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.635
I mean, we both
had lives of our own.

15:04.703 --> 15:08.071
You went out with other guys.
I never asked you about them.

15:08.139 --> 15:12.009
I figured... if you wanted
to tell me about 'em,
you'd tell me.

15:12.076 --> 15:14.812
Well, Michael,

- Water, Edith.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.768
Then you're gonna stand there
and blame your life on us.

23:25.836 --> 23:28.138
Archie, be nice.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.440
Think of
the little boy.

23:30.508 --> 23:33.543
Don't be tryin' to make me
feel bad about that!

23:33.611 --> 23:35.745
What's the use of me
thinkin' about him?

23:37.548 --> 23:39.582
I mean, there ain't nothin'
I can do about him.

23:40.951 --> 23:43.887
You know, look, sis, we got
a little house here...

23:43.954 --> 23:47.557
And a family and, uh--

23:47.625 --> 23:50.560
well, I mean,
the best we can do
is wish you luck.

23:51.829 --> 23:53.763
Luck.

23:53.831 --> 23:56.333
And God bless us,
everyone.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.335
Right?

24:24.862 --> 24:27.364
Oh, I hope
that poor girl...

24:27.432 --> 24:30.867
Finds a nice husband
and settles down.
Sure.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.570
Well, while all of youse
is standin' around here...

24:33.637 --> 24:36.606
Dreamin' up them
charmin' possibilities,

24:36.674 --> 24:40.544
I gotta go upstairs,
change my clothes
and get ready for work.

24:40.611 --> 24:44.114
Daddy, before you go,
I think you owe Michael
an apology.

24:45.383 --> 24:47.551
I owe him an apology?

24:48.686 --> 24:51.288
Well, he owes me...

24:51.355 --> 24:53.457
Two years' rent.

24:57.861 --> 24:59.796
So we're even.
