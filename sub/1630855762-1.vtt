WEBVTT

00:15.432 --> 00:17.642
(contemplative music playing)

00:18.893 --> 00:21.104
(film projector rattling)

00:23.440 --> 00:25.817
Johnny Carson:
We have a very lovely gal
with us tonight.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.527
She's considered
the number-one model

00:27.610 --> 00:29.904
in what they call
"ultra-high fashion."

00:29.988 --> 00:31.823
Welcome Miss Danielle Luna.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.742
(applause)

00:40.331 --> 00:43.501
Uh, this is, uh,
Danielle Luna, who is, uh--

00:43.585 --> 00:46.546
-Donyale.
-Johnny: Dan-- Donyale.
Donyale. I'm sorry.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.923
She's one
of the highest-paid
fashion models,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.885
uh, in the business.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.637
Could you give me
an idea of, uh, something
you-you might do?

00:54.679 --> 00:57.432
Uh, suppose we took a close-up
and I wanted a, uh--

00:57.515 --> 01:00.268
-Um, let's see.
-I'm not good
at this type of stuff.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.437
-Uh, I'll give you
the Luna look.
-Alrighty.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.149
Donyale Luna:
You go like this.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.574
(laughter and applause)

01:14.657 --> 01:17.202
(peaceful music playing)

01:19.371 --> 01:21.164
Pat Cleveland:
Donyale Luna,

01:21.206 --> 01:24.125
she was, like,
something ethereal.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.169
If she walked into
this room right now,

01:26.211 --> 01:29.089
the whole place
would just-- it would float.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.717
Speaker:
I think some people
thought that she was

01:32.759 --> 01:34.426
from another planet.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.597
She did not look
like any human being

01:37.681 --> 01:39.015
I had ever seen or met.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.893
Constance White:
She was in London.
She was in Paris.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.728
She was in Italy.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.732
She was the first Black woman
to be on the cover of "Vogue."

01:48.441 --> 01:52.570
But strangely enough,
we've totally forgotten
about her.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.073
My understanding
of the first Black woman

01:55.156 --> 01:58.410
to cover a "Vogue" magazine
was Beverly Johnson.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.162
And what was weird is,
somebody who had been

02:01.246 --> 02:03.873
a model manager
for the last 25 years,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.251
I didn't know
who Donyale Luna was.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.169
I never heard of Donyale Luna.

02:09.753 --> 02:15.385
Omar K. Boone:
She was the first Black
supermodel in the world.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.637
People should know who she is.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.932
Speaker 1:
Why don't we know
more about her?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.726
Speaker 2:
They always said to her,

02:22.767 --> 02:25.728
"Where are you from?"

02:25.770 --> 02:31.317
And she'd always say,
"My name is Luna.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.945
I'm from the moon."

02:41.286 --> 02:42.954
(birds calling)

02:42.996 --> 02:45.290
(bell tolling)

02:48.460 --> 02:51.129
(projector rattling)

02:51.171 --> 02:54.257
Dream Cazzaniga:
Growing up in Italy,

02:54.299 --> 02:57.552
I remember seeing the moon.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.972
My nanny was telling me,

03:01.056 --> 03:06.561
"Oh, look, uh, that's your mom
looking upon you from the sky."

03:09.814 --> 03:11.649
I never doubted that.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.402
Whenever I was
looking at the moon,

03:14.486 --> 03:17.822
I thought that was
my blessing from her.

03:26.873 --> 03:31.378
When my mom passed away,
I was, uh, 18 months old.

03:33.463 --> 03:38.301
And my grandparents
raised me after she passed.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.848
They told me she passed
because of a, a heart condition,

03:43.932 --> 03:46.142
but growing up,

03:46.184 --> 03:50.438
the subject of my mom was
kind of a taboo in the house.

03:50.522 --> 03:54.984
So, I didn't really
know what was the truth.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.737
When a child is that little,

03:57.821 --> 04:01.199
when I was that little,
I needed her.

04:01.991 --> 04:06.204
It's very hard to understand
that you matter to someone

04:06.246 --> 04:09.040
if you don't have
any memories with her

04:09.124 --> 04:14.045
and if there is,
uh, basically, no one
helping you build

04:14.129 --> 04:17.507
the picture of her
and you together.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.595
These are some
of my mom's writings.

04:22.679 --> 04:28.643
She writes about her friends,
about my father, about me.

04:28.727 --> 04:34.941
And there's
so many interesting stories
that tell me who she was.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.699
(wind whistling)

04:42.782 --> 04:44.284
"Once upon a time,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.077
"a little colored girl

04:46.161 --> 04:48.913
"was born inside a goddess.

04:48.997 --> 04:53.668
"With a heart made of dreams
and a mind made of love,

04:53.752 --> 04:56.046
"she took her
long, skinny legs

04:56.129 --> 04:59.049
"and came
into this world, Earth.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.470
Oh, Lord, yes, she did."

05:19.152 --> 05:23.948
Omar:
Donyale Luna was just
a girl from Detroit,

05:24.032 --> 05:28.119
and her real name
was Peggy Ann Freeman.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.454
Yeah, I'd call her
by her real name.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.873
I'd say, "Peggy!"

05:31.956 --> 05:33.457
(laughs)

05:33.500 --> 05:35.377
And she'd crack up.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.300
Lillian Washington: Okay.
Let me put these pictures up.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.011
-So, you gonna--
-Oh, I got a good one.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.554
Oh, let me see. Let me see.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.641
This is the famous
Donyale Luna,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.643
this is her graduation picture.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.561
Marcella Washington: Wow.
How old was she on that picture?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.146
Lillian:
She's about 16 or 17 that day.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.023
-Marcella:
Oh, she graduated early?
-Lillian: Yes.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.817
Marcella:
Pretty. Very pretty.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.568
Lillian:
I always called her
Little Peggy

06:00.652 --> 06:04.447
'cause that's what Mama
named her, after, after Mama.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.658
Big Peggy and Little Peggy.

06:06.741 --> 06:10.412
Okay. Let me see
what else is in here.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.373
This is Donyale's mother.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.501
She was gorgeous.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.046
My mama looked like
Queen Elizabeth. (chuckles)

06:20.130 --> 06:25.510
I used to say that,
and that's where Donyale got
a majority of her beauty.

06:25.552 --> 06:29.264
The light complexion
she, she got from my mother.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.183
But see, my father
was quite handsome, too,

06:32.225 --> 06:33.643
even though he were,

06:33.685 --> 06:38.690
he were a, a brown skin,
caramel-colored Black man,

06:38.732 --> 06:41.609
and I had same complexion.

06:41.693 --> 06:45.363
I always felt that I wasn't
pretty, you know, as her.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.658
I did-- I never felt
that I was pretty.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.666
Our parents were part
of the Great Migration

06:56.707 --> 07:00.920
from down south
to up north to work.

07:01.004 --> 07:05.300
My mother, she worked
at the YWCA for 27 years,

07:05.383 --> 07:09.179
and our father worked
at Henry Ford's Motor Company

07:09.220 --> 07:10.889
for 37 years.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.392
So, we were
very well taken care of.

07:14.476 --> 07:18.563
But, uh, because my mother
was very strict,

07:18.646 --> 07:22.859
we were kept
from a lotta things that
everybody else did normally.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.612
We weren't allowed
to go roller-skating.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.865
We weren't allowed
to have birthday parties.

07:28.907 --> 07:34.079
But Donyale was
the bright side of everything.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.706
She didn't let anything
keep her down too long.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.793
Josephine Armstrong:
She knew she wanted to be

07:39.876 --> 07:42.212
something special
when she grew up,

07:42.253 --> 07:47.175
that she had something
in her mind that she wanted
to do with her life.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.844
(rehearsal piano music playing)

07:49.928 --> 07:52.597
She was in this
arts group here in Detroit,

07:52.681 --> 07:55.975
and she was in,
um, several plays,

07:56.058 --> 07:59.729
and she was the star
of a couple of 'em.

07:59.771 --> 08:03.775
She always wanted
to be a movie star.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.778
She loved "West Side Story."

08:06.820 --> 08:09.072
Anita (sings):
♪ Life can be bright
in America ♪

08:09.114 --> 08:11.199
Boys (sing):
♪ If you can fight in America ♪

08:11.282 --> 08:13.785
Girls (sing):
♪ Life is alright in America ♪

08:13.827 --> 08:17.122
Boys (sing):
♪ If you're all white
in America ♪

08:17.205 --> 08:18.790
(cheering, chattering)

08:20.291 --> 08:25.630
Omar:
Here was this incredibly
tall, beautiful woman.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.091
I mean,
even at that awkward age,

08:28.133 --> 08:29.592
and she was kinda awkward,

08:29.634 --> 08:33.471
I always, I always
th-thought of her as a gazelle

08:33.554 --> 08:36.057
with the neck
that just, like, pshew.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.434
What a neck, I mean,
I mean, she was unique.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.477
There was no doubt about it.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.731
Lillian:
She had a certain charisma,

08:42.813 --> 08:47.652
a certain, uh, aura,
a certain style.

08:47.736 --> 08:53.158
But, uh, all the Black fellas
thought she was crazy.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.577
They didn't like her.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.289
They thought she
was skinny and bony.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.541
They called her "Olive Oyl."

09:01.624 --> 09:04.544
They hurt her to her core.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.838
(contemplative music playing)

09:11.426 --> 09:16.181
Dream: "No one thought
I was beautiful in Detroit.

09:16.222 --> 09:21.019
"I was very ashamed
of myself, almost paranoid,

09:21.061 --> 09:25.440
"always wishing I could look
like this person or that.

09:25.523 --> 09:29.152
I wanted to be
a typical something."

09:29.194 --> 09:32.864
Announcer:
T-minus 60 seconds
and counting.

09:32.947 --> 09:37.744
Lillian:
I think that encouraged her
to create her own persona

09:37.827 --> 09:43.083
where she's beautiful
and people see her beautiful.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.710
Announcer:
Good luck and godspeed.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.714
Lillian:
She was in her late teens,

09:49.798 --> 09:55.470
and she created
the persona of Donyale Luna.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.306
John Glenn:
Oh, that view is tremendous!

09:59.808 --> 10:02.060
Lillian:
She wrote it and wrote it,

10:02.143 --> 10:04.062
and then she
wrote it some more.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.774
And I looked at it, I said,
"'Donyale Luna,' that's good."

10:11.069 --> 10:13.780
Then she changed
the way she talked.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.116
She created an accent,

10:16.199 --> 10:20.120
but she had never been
anywhere to get an accent.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.874
I was just wonderin',
"Why is she doin' this?"

10:26.751 --> 10:29.754
First the name, Donyale Luna.
Is this a real name?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.256
Donyale:
Yes, it is.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.633
It's part of my name.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.719
My complete name is

10:35.760 --> 10:40.640
Peggy Anna Donyale
Cazzaniga Luna Freeman,

10:40.724 --> 10:44.728
but, uh, I just cut it short
and use "Donyale Luna."

10:44.769 --> 10:48.940
Interviewer:
What sort of, uh, racial mixture
do all those names come from?

10:49.024 --> 10:52.902
(sighs) You name it,
and it's there. Everything.

10:52.944 --> 10:56.865
It's like
a, a melting pot of, say,

10:56.948 --> 11:00.035
different nationalities,
different people, everything.

11:01.369 --> 11:05.623
My father, the Donyale persona?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.793
(disapprovingly)
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.672
"Oh, you don't wanna be Black?
You're Black."

11:13.965 --> 11:15.967
She didn't give a damn.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.929
She created
a, a new person, a new being.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.307
She says, "I am me."

11:29.022 --> 11:31.316
Sanders Bryant:
I first met Peggy

11:31.399 --> 11:37.113
in 1962 in high school.

11:37.155 --> 11:41.826
One day, she was, uh, kind of
by herself, off to herself,

11:41.868 --> 11:47.832
and I sat
and joined her for lunch.

11:47.915 --> 11:52.796
She introduced herself
as Donyale Luna.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.674
She would say that she was

11:55.757 --> 12:00.178
part... Indian,
Spanish, Irish.

12:00.261 --> 12:04.015
She'd just go down
the list of nationalities

12:04.099 --> 12:07.560
and claimed
to be a part of them.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.856
So, her persona
kind of developed,

12:11.898 --> 12:17.987
but this was,
definitely... an escape.

12:20.073 --> 12:24.619
Her mother and father
had been apart

12:24.703 --> 12:28.039
and remarried
three or four times.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.917
I heard he could get belligerent

12:31.001 --> 12:35.130
and, uh... uh, physical.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.758
But Donyale,

12:38.842 --> 12:44.222
if anything serious
was to be discussed,

12:44.264 --> 12:47.767
she wanted
to change the subject.

12:49.269 --> 12:54.983
Donyale lived...
in sort of a... way

12:55.066 --> 13:00.155
where she would pretend
and she would tell stories,

13:00.238 --> 13:03.867
and she black out
many things in her life.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.910
Sanders:
In a sense,

13:05.994 --> 13:10.373
she herself
lived a performance.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.679
My, my favorite flower,

13:24.763 --> 13:27.432
perfect flower,
I don't have any.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.601
I don't have one.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.353
(chuckles)

13:31.436 --> 13:33.772
Favorite what? Color?

13:33.855 --> 13:36.399
Um, yellow.

13:38.193 --> 13:41.488
Because the color
yellow is deceiving

13:41.571 --> 13:43.907
and I like it on me,

13:43.948 --> 13:46.159
and I like, uh, what,
what it represents

13:46.242 --> 13:48.953
because I'm a very
deceiving person.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.917
David McCabe:
I was in Detroit

13:53.958 --> 13:57.796
working on an assignment
for Ford Motors,

13:57.837 --> 14:02.634
and, uh, Donyale
happened to stop by

14:02.676 --> 14:04.135
and watch what was going on,

14:04.219 --> 14:07.180
and she was on her way
back from school, um,

14:07.263 --> 14:10.141
uh, wearing her school uniform.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.686
She was almost
six feet tall,

14:12.769 --> 14:15.397
and she had legs
that went on for a mile,

14:15.480 --> 14:17.691
and a beautiful smile.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.151
I was just stunned.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.113
I gave her my card and said,

14:23.154 --> 14:25.782
"If you're ever
in New York, give me a call.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.158
I think you could model."

14:27.242 --> 14:30.495
And she said,
"But I'm only 14."
(chuckles)

14:30.537 --> 14:34.124
He saw me and he thought
I was, oh, so fantastic,

14:34.165 --> 14:35.792
and he says,
"You must be a model."

14:35.834 --> 14:37.335
And I says, "No, I'm not."

14:37.377 --> 14:39.504
And, uh, he said,
"Well, here's my card.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.882
If you ever come to New York,
please look me up."

14:42.966 --> 14:46.344
Five minutes later,
he ran back to me and he says,

14:46.428 --> 14:49.639
"You've got to come to New York.
You've got to do this and that."

14:49.681 --> 14:52.642
-Interviewer: He looked you up?
-Well, no, not that.

14:52.684 --> 14:57.605
It's-- You, y-- He knew
something that I didn't know.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.526
Aurora James:
When you're a young girl
like Donyale Luna

15:01.568 --> 15:05.363
and you have someone
come up to you and say,
"You're beautiful,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.282
"I think that you
should come to New York

15:07.365 --> 15:09.743
and do this amazing,
glamorous thing,"

15:09.826 --> 15:11.870
of course, you're gonna
say yes. Right?

15:11.953 --> 15:13.204
You're dying to get
out of your town

15:13.288 --> 15:14.581
where you don't feel accepted,

15:14.664 --> 15:16.124
where you feel like, you know,

15:16.207 --> 15:17.834
you have bigger opportunities,

15:17.876 --> 15:19.753
you can do all
these other things.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.130
But at what cost?

15:22.797 --> 15:27.260
About two years later,
I get a, a call from her, uh,

15:27.344 --> 15:30.221
saying that she's going
to be in New York

15:30.305 --> 15:35.060
and could I help her, uh,
maybe get with a modeling agency

15:35.143 --> 15:36.936
and, and take some
photographs of her

15:37.020 --> 15:39.481
so she could present
them to the agency?

15:39.564 --> 15:44.152
There is one other thing
that I do remember, uh,

15:44.235 --> 15:47.572
and that was that she claimed

15:47.655 --> 15:51.409
that she was so exotic-looking

15:51.618 --> 15:55.538
because one
of her parents was Mexican.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.919
I mean, I don't know
if that was, perhaps,
necessary at the time,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.255
rather to say that
you are a Black person,

16:04.339 --> 16:06.925
you are a Mexican person.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.887
So, maybe that--
she thought that might make her

16:10.929 --> 16:13.765
more, uh, acceptable, yeah.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.435
Josephine:
When Donyale left,

16:17.519 --> 16:19.938
I was very afraid,

16:20.021 --> 16:23.149
yet I knew she had
to go and, you know,

16:23.233 --> 16:26.444
go on her own path.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.615
I was a little sad.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.786
I was happy for her,
like I said, very happy for her,

16:34.869 --> 16:39.708
but a little sad because...
she wasn't comin' back too soon,

16:39.790 --> 16:41.459
and she didn't.

16:45.213 --> 16:48.842
I felt like
she left me behind.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.135
That's all.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.638
It just-- It k--
It kinda hurt a little bit.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.318
Dream:
"Joyfully filled with love,

17:07.359 --> 17:11.489
"little girl split
to New York,

17:11.573 --> 17:17.203
became the model...
and got a lotta money."

17:19.830 --> 17:21.624
(horns honking)

17:21.665 --> 17:23.376
(siren wailing)

17:25.670 --> 17:27.672
(relaxing music playing)

17:32.177 --> 17:34.929
"New York is a dream!

17:35.013 --> 17:38.475
"A man danced me
down Fifth Avenue,

17:38.516 --> 17:40.352
"and all up and down Broadway

17:40.435 --> 17:44.022
"men were eyeing
and whistling at me.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.316
"I'll be on top of the world

17:46.358 --> 17:49.778
"if it takes
every breath I have,

17:49.819 --> 17:52.155
"every muscle
of my skinny body.

17:52.197 --> 17:56.743
I'll be some kind of star
real soon, real soon."

17:59.496 --> 18:01.581
Omar:
When she first
came to New York,

18:01.664 --> 18:04.876
she was like a deer
in the headlights.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.213
I mean, that's
how innocent she was.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.466
Donyale:
I was like a child.

18:11.549 --> 18:15.220
All these big buildings
and chic people.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.390
And, you know, I was all
in black and not very chic,

18:18.431 --> 18:22.227
and very young with big eyes
looking at everything.

18:22.268 --> 18:26.564
Omar: I could see that
she was not sophisticated.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.234
She, (laughs) she used to make
me laugh 'cause she was--

18:29.317 --> 18:34.155
she, she would pronounce
"asparagus" as "as-par-gee."

18:34.239 --> 18:37.492
(chuckles)
And, and, and I said,
"Donyale, no.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.453
That-That's not the way
ya pronounce it," you know?

18:40.537 --> 18:42.497
But she was a quick learner,

18:42.580 --> 18:45.792
and that is one of the things
that endeared me to her.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.877
She learned quickly.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.926
Dr. Richard J. Powell:
David McCabe's invitation
to Donyale Luna

18:55.010 --> 18:56.928
to, uh, come to New York

18:56.970 --> 19:01.141
in the fall of 1964
is fortuitous.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.936
She is entering, uh,
an incredibly exciting moment

19:04.978 --> 19:06.521
in the art world.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.356
And, perhaps,
the ultimate artist

19:08.440 --> 19:11.484
in 1964/'65 is Andy Warhol.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.278
(shutter clicks)

19:13.361 --> 19:17.198
David:
At the time that I was doing
the shootings of Andy Warhol,

19:17.282 --> 19:19.284
I took Donyale with me

19:19.325 --> 19:22.328
over to his factory
one afternoon.

19:22.412 --> 19:27.667
And he was absolutely
beguiled by her, um,

19:27.751 --> 19:33.214
and she began to hang
with the-- all the crowd
from the Factory.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.467
(indistinct chatter)

19:35.508 --> 19:40.472
So Andy Warhol,
some people referred to him
as "The Vampire."

19:40.513 --> 19:43.725
And what they meant by that
is that he kind of enjoyed

19:43.808 --> 19:46.728
kind of taking on
the lifeblood and flow of,

19:46.811 --> 19:49.647
of other people's
talents and energies.

19:49.689 --> 19:54.069
And he saw in Donyale Luna
a, a personality and a spirit

19:54.152 --> 19:56.071
that was kind of tailor-made.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.615
(cool jazz music playing)

20:02.660 --> 20:05.663
And it didn't take long
for Donyale Luna

20:05.747 --> 20:09.918
to be a part
of this lively cultural scene

20:10.001 --> 20:12.295
that was going on in New York.

20:15.965 --> 20:21.721
I met Donyale Luna in 1965

20:21.805 --> 20:23.973
at a club called Il Mio.

20:24.015 --> 20:27.310
I used to go there
every night to dance for free

20:27.352 --> 20:30.939
and drink for free
because I was me.

20:31.022 --> 20:34.818
I looked over across
the tiny dance floor,

20:34.859 --> 20:37.570
and she was dancing away,
"undulating" I call it,

20:37.654 --> 20:40.532
from the toes up to the head
then down again.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.909
No one danced like Donyale Luna.

20:44.494 --> 20:48.164
I said, "Hello."
She goes, "Hi, baby."

20:48.206 --> 20:49.874
I said, "Hi."

20:49.958 --> 20:53.920
She said, "I'm Donyale,"
and I said, "I know."

20:54.004 --> 20:57.382
I think she's
the most beautiful woman
I've ever met in my life.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.009
I don't think so, I know so.

20:59.884 --> 21:06.099
People would literally stop,
sometimes 15 feet away from her.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.560
Her face read from blocks away,

21:08.643 --> 21:11.563
which taught photographers
to understand.

21:12.731 --> 21:16.943
The arms sell sweaters
and the face sells dreams.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.695
And they could see that.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.409
Donyale:
To go to New York
was like a dream.

21:24.451 --> 21:30.415
It was like Emerald City,
like, uh, you know,
"Alice in Wonderland."

21:32.542 --> 21:34.919
David McCabe called up
"Harper's Bazaar"

21:35.003 --> 21:38.506
and then I went
to "Harper's Bazaar"
that afternoon.

21:38.590 --> 21:42.427
Uh, I saw the director.
She liked me very much.

21:42.469 --> 21:46.181
She told me I was very
beautiful and this and that.

21:46.264 --> 21:49.517
And she had
every director there

21:49.601 --> 21:52.020
bring in everything
they could find:

21:52.103 --> 21:53.521
coats, hats, bathing suits,

21:53.605 --> 21:56.274
and I tried them all on.

21:56.358 --> 21:59.694
"Harper's Bazaar,"
"Bazaar" as they said,

21:59.778 --> 22:03.031
was the chicest
magazine in the world.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.325
They had
the best photographers,

22:05.408 --> 22:07.869
the pages were
the most beautiful,

22:07.952 --> 22:11.790
and the photographs
were treated as art.

22:11.831 --> 22:16.961
So, "Bazaar" was
the magazine of the world.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.714
Constance: I mean,
when Donyale Luna came along,

22:19.798 --> 22:22.175
the cover of "Harper's Bazaar"

22:22.258 --> 22:24.344
was something that
wasn't happening

22:24.427 --> 22:27.389
for Black women period.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.475
There was tremendous resistance

22:30.558 --> 22:34.479
to putting people of color
on the cover of magazines

22:34.521 --> 22:39.651
outside a magazine
like "Ebony" or "Jet."

22:39.693 --> 22:41.361
Dr. Powell:
The world that Donyale Luna

22:41.444 --> 22:44.823
finds herself stepping
into in the '60s

22:44.906 --> 22:48.410
is a world that still is,
in some ways, based on a kind

22:48.493 --> 22:52.080
of a Euro-American white ideal.

22:52.163 --> 22:56.334
(female chorus singing)

22:56.418 --> 22:58.461
Narrator:
Make your pale complexion

22:58.503 --> 23:01.464
look like peaches and cream.

23:01.506 --> 23:05.427
Image representation matters,

23:05.510 --> 23:07.971
and it couldn't be more true

23:08.013 --> 23:10.849
when you think
about standards of beauty.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.184
It's something
that Black women

23:13.268 --> 23:16.479
have a singular
experience with.

23:16.521 --> 23:18.565
You're not beautiful enough.
Your hair's not right.

23:18.648 --> 23:22.360
Your skin color's wrong.
Your lips are too big.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.362
Your nose is too small.

23:24.446 --> 23:28.533
Everything about you is wrong.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.453
(camera shutter clicks)

23:33.538 --> 23:36.416
Dr. Powell: And so,
it's kind of remarkable.

23:36.499 --> 23:41.046
Donyale Luna arrives
in the fall of 1964.

23:41.087 --> 23:45.383
By January 1965,
we're talking three months,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.552
(chuckles)
she's on the cover

23:47.594 --> 23:49.596
of "Harper's Bazaar"
as a drawing.

23:50.597 --> 23:54.059
It is interesting, though,
that they've chosen
to make her pale,

23:54.100 --> 23:56.603
that, that they, they
do not make her brown,

23:56.686 --> 23:58.688
which is what she was,
or, or, or light brown.

23:58.730 --> 24:02.192
They, they almost make
her almost peachy colored.

24:02.233 --> 24:06.279
Dream:
"Straight away, everything
happened all at once.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.324
"No struggling.
No anxious waiting.

24:09.407 --> 24:14.120
I just hit New York
and it was all there
ready for me."

24:14.204 --> 24:16.581
Wow! I couldn't believe it.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.376
Wow! I said,
"Gee, that's my sister!

24:19.459 --> 24:23.421
Oh, she's so pretty.
Oh, she's so beautiful."

24:23.505 --> 24:26.508
Yes, that's my sis.
(chuckles)

24:33.223 --> 24:36.434
David McCabe:
I think in the '60s,
there was a lot of prejudice

24:36.476 --> 24:39.354
in America towards
people of color.

24:39.437 --> 24:44.442
But since I'm an Englishman,
I had none of those feelings.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.027
So, when I saw her,

24:46.111 --> 24:50.490
I just realized what great
potential she had as a model.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.118
(cool jazz music playing)

24:53.201 --> 24:55.537
I introduced her to Avedon.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.580
And Avedon really loved her

24:57.622 --> 25:01.960
and, I think, wanted
to sign her to a contract.

25:02.043 --> 25:07.340
Hamish Bowles:
Richard Avedon emerged
in the '40s in New York,

25:07.424 --> 25:12.012
and he was...
I think in many ways,

25:12.095 --> 25:17.225
the greatest fashion
photographer of his time.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.436
He is really

25:19.519 --> 25:23.982
the great gatekeeper
of fashion in America.

25:24.858 --> 25:28.862
Gideon Lewin:
I think Avedon really
believed in Donyale.

25:28.945 --> 25:34.325
From the moment she walked in,
he knew she is "it."

25:34.367 --> 25:36.494
I felt the same way. She is it.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.246
There's no question.

25:38.872 --> 25:43.209
And he was willing to
sign her up for a contract.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.506
Richard Avedon was a--
maybe one of the greatest

25:48.590 --> 25:51.259
photo-- fashion photographers
of all time.

25:51.343 --> 25:54.888
And for him to put
her under contract meant that

25:54.971 --> 25:57.891
"I don't want anybody else
shooting this woman.

25:57.974 --> 26:01.478
This is how extraordinary
this woman is

26:01.519 --> 26:03.855
and she's mine."

26:04.522 --> 26:06.399
Unheard of.

26:06.483 --> 26:10.320
Unheard of for a Black woman.

26:10.362 --> 26:15.158
Let's go to the, uh, special
issue of "Harper's Bazaar,"

26:15.200 --> 26:18.453
for 1965, the April issue.

26:18.536 --> 26:21.581
Avedon was guest editor

26:21.664 --> 26:24.751
who photographed
all the images in this book,

26:24.834 --> 26:30.423
and that's really
a, uh, portrait of the times.

26:30.507 --> 26:34.552
And there's actually
Donyale right here.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.596
Just beautiful.

26:36.680 --> 26:40.850
She is moving so gracefully.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.776
No one has ever
posed like this,

26:49.859 --> 26:52.070
on the ground, the f--
hands in the back,

26:52.112 --> 26:57.075
that long body of hers
out like a panther... no one.

26:57.158 --> 26:59.703
Dr. Powell:
And then there are
those other images

26:59.744 --> 27:03.707
with her counterpart,
the German model Veruschka.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.793
This is quite remarkable.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.586
We're talking
about a moment
when Black people

27:08.670 --> 27:12.799
are barely a figure
in, in high fashion.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.217
And within
a couple of months,

27:14.259 --> 27:17.137
you've had this young
African American woman

27:17.220 --> 27:21.099
defining the kind of look
of mid-'60s onward.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.150
Omar:
She broke the mold

27:30.233 --> 27:34.362
of using Black models
in the '60s,

27:34.446 --> 27:40.326
and it made me happy to see
this young girl that I knew
really blossom.

27:41.077 --> 27:46.207
Lillian:
Oh, she's so pretty.
Oh, she's so beautiful.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.626
I knew it.
I just knew it. I knew it.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.795
I knew she was
gonna become a star.

27:52.130 --> 27:55.008
I thought there
was no stoppin' her.

28:02.557 --> 28:05.685
Gideon:
When the magazine came out...

28:05.769 --> 28:09.856
the white population
down south...

28:09.939 --> 28:14.486
they completely rejected
the, the, the, the magazine.

28:14.527 --> 28:18.448
Aurora: "Harper's Bazaar"
received a ton of backlash.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.867
There was a loss of subscribers,

28:20.950 --> 28:22.786
advertisers were pulling,

28:22.827 --> 28:26.664
and it just was,
basically, not possible

28:26.748 --> 28:28.792
to keep featuring her

28:28.875 --> 28:32.170
if the magazine was expecting
to do business as normal.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.922
Dr. Powell:
Donyale Luna discovers,

28:34.005 --> 28:37.634
after all of the successes
of "Harper's Bazaar,"

28:37.676 --> 28:42.263
that there is a glass ceiling
for beautiful Black women,

28:42.347 --> 28:44.933
and Madison Avenue
basically said,

28:45.016 --> 28:48.687
"Well, we just won't feature
her in our publications."

28:48.770 --> 28:51.231
Yeah. Don't do it again.

28:51.314 --> 28:54.609
Yeah. That was
exactly what they said.

28:54.693 --> 28:57.320
"Don't do it again."

28:59.572 --> 29:01.157
David Croland:
It was unspoken,

29:01.199 --> 29:05.829
but it was just
so loudly unspoken.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.915
They would put up a barrier,
which was always there,

29:08.998 --> 29:10.333
and then they would allow,

29:10.375 --> 29:14.379
and then they would put
the fuckin' barrier up again.

29:15.755 --> 29:19.050
Aurora:
Society doesn't like change.

29:19.134 --> 29:23.263
And so, when you put
a Black woman in a role

29:23.346 --> 29:26.725
where you're then
asking the reader

29:26.766 --> 29:30.103
to find her aspirational,

29:30.186 --> 29:33.106
you're gonna get hit
with some major backlash,
back then,

29:33.189 --> 29:35.525
and by the way,
also still today.

29:35.567 --> 29:40.113
But I think as a human,
what she would've experienced

29:40.196 --> 29:45.243
in being on the receiving end
of that backlash is horrific.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.877
Dream: "My mother
is worried about me.

29:53.918 --> 29:58.506
"I was in Detroit
just over a year ago.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.884
"She's worried I'll be hurt.

30:02.761 --> 30:07.015
She doesn't know
I've already been hurt."

30:11.936 --> 30:16.441
Lillian:
It was deep wintertime...

30:16.483 --> 30:19.778
and my parents were having

30:19.861 --> 30:23.281
a serious misunderstanding.

30:23.365 --> 30:27.619
S-Some sort
of a fight, I guess.

30:28.495 --> 30:30.747
And, um...

30:30.789 --> 30:35.251
somehow, uh,
my father was in the car

30:35.293 --> 30:38.129
that my mother
had bought for him,

30:38.213 --> 30:40.215
and he got outta the car.

30:40.298 --> 30:43.385
I was in the house watching
this through the window,

30:43.468 --> 30:47.472
and I was, I think,
15 or 16 at the time.

30:47.514 --> 30:52.560
And, uh, my mother
shot and killed my father.

30:56.731 --> 30:59.067
She was shakin'
her head and cryin',

30:59.150 --> 31:00.568
"I never meant to kill him.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.488
I never meant to kill him.
I just wanted him to stop,"

31:03.571 --> 31:06.658
because they had a history
of domestic violence.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.247
I'm sorry.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.084
Um...

31:17.836 --> 31:22.882
I, uh, I was
in a, a deep depression
for many years after that.

31:26.177 --> 31:30.682
I watched that happen...
looking out the window

31:30.765 --> 31:32.934
right in front of me.

31:34.686 --> 31:38.523
Sanders:
Donyale did not come
for the funeral.

31:40.025 --> 31:43.319
There were
too many bad memories

31:43.361 --> 31:47.657
that she wanted
to separate herself from.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.538
I don't know the circumstances,

31:53.580 --> 31:57.500
but I do know she did
have a nervous breakdown.

31:59.085 --> 32:02.922
She was
in Bellevue mental ward

32:03.006 --> 32:06.092
for at least
two or three weeks.

32:06.176 --> 32:09.554
She wouldn't
discuss the details,

32:09.637 --> 32:14.059
but I did know
there were a lot of pressures,

32:14.100 --> 32:20.065
both domestically at home
and in New York.

32:20.148 --> 32:24.069
Everything was
in black and white

32:24.152 --> 32:26.488
and she resented that.

32:29.866 --> 32:33.495
She went
into her fantasy world.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.413
(electronic beep)

32:35.455 --> 32:39.084
Announcer:
We confirm the separation
here on the ground.

32:40.752 --> 32:45.131
It's strange because
a lot of the things
my mom went through,

32:45.215 --> 32:48.510
I experienced
in a similar way.

32:50.762 --> 32:53.515
Growing up without a mom,

32:53.598 --> 32:58.311
it felt like something
was always missing.

33:03.316 --> 33:06.277
Some souls, like hers,

33:06.319 --> 33:09.406
and I guess,
like me, at some level,

33:09.447 --> 33:12.909
when the sensitivity
is too high,

33:12.951 --> 33:16.287
you're scared that this
is gonna suck you in...

33:17.747 --> 33:22.544
so you create fairy tales.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.630
A way to escape.

33:29.300 --> 33:34.597
"The little girl felt
so lost in her mind...

33:34.639 --> 33:38.601
and so, she split
to another world."

33:41.312 --> 33:46.985
David Croland:
After a year in, uh,
New York City, she left.

33:47.027 --> 33:52.657
She went to London,
and that's when it
really started...

33:52.699 --> 33:55.285
because it did.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.245
Oh, yeah.

33:57.328 --> 34:00.457
-(drumroll playing)
-(crowd applauding)

34:04.919 --> 34:06.963
(crowd cheering)

34:07.005 --> 34:09.757
(rock music playing)

34:14.721 --> 34:21.311
'60s London was completely
phenomenal and unparalleled.

34:22.562 --> 34:24.481
There was
this sense of, kind of,

34:24.522 --> 34:26.483
electric possibility
and potential,

34:26.524 --> 34:29.485
and it was coming
from young people,

34:29.527 --> 34:32.197
and it was coming
from the student protests

34:32.237 --> 34:35.742
and this kind
of fierce politicization

34:35.824 --> 34:37.369
of a whole generation,

34:37.452 --> 34:41.539
who weren't prepared
to accept the status quo.

34:42.748 --> 34:46.628
Suddenly,
fashion was percolating
up from the street.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.672
It was coming
from young people,

34:48.713 --> 34:50.715
and you have
these designers emerging

34:50.799 --> 34:52.384
from the Royal College of Art:

34:52.425 --> 34:55.387
Zandra Rhodes and Ossie Clark,

34:55.469 --> 34:57.722
and they're shaking
things up, too.

34:57.806 --> 35:02.185
I think it was a very, very
vibrant time in London.

35:02.769 --> 35:07.232
Swinging '60s
with Mary Quant,
uh, minidresses.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.944
And I'd had myself
a Vidal Sassoon haircut.

35:11.027 --> 35:14.864
And then it was
Twiggy and her look.

35:14.906 --> 35:17.534
Host:
Some time the emaciated
English model Twiggy

35:17.575 --> 35:19.703
has been the darling
of the fashion scene.

35:19.744 --> 35:22.414
But today, an even more unusual
and more talked about model

35:22.497 --> 35:24.040
arrived in the model business.

35:24.082 --> 35:25.709
She's Donyale Luna.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.086
Hamish:
Everything was being
shaken up,

35:28.169 --> 35:30.588
and it was iconoclastic.

35:30.630 --> 35:33.925
It was about breaking
down existing rules,

35:33.967 --> 35:39.764
and one of those rules was
who got to say what beauty was.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.773
(person speaking)

35:52.193 --> 35:53.653
(person speaking)

35:53.737 --> 35:54.863
(horn honks)

36:03.121 --> 36:04.581
(person speaking)

36:07.292 --> 36:09.419
(person speaking)

36:17.802 --> 36:21.723
Dr. Powell:
Given the challenges
of Black life in America,

36:21.806 --> 36:25.852
especially, the lack
of mainstream America

36:25.935 --> 36:29.189
to recognize
Black beauty, Black genius,

36:29.272 --> 36:34.944
Black accomplishment,
many African Americans
find their way abroad.

36:35.028 --> 36:36.404
Announcer 1:
There's Josephine Baker.

36:36.488 --> 36:39.657
(big band music playing)

36:39.699 --> 36:41.493
Announcer 2:
The toast of the fashion world

36:41.576 --> 36:43.244
was model, Dorothea Towles.

36:43.328 --> 36:45.580
Home from her
successes in Paris,

36:45.663 --> 36:48.041
she brought back
a $70,000 wardrobe

36:48.124 --> 36:50.335
by the style capital's
top designer.

36:50.418 --> 36:55.840
So, Europe has always
been kind of a magnet for,
for, for, for Black artists

36:55.924 --> 36:58.385
who, who want to be
seen in their totality,

36:58.468 --> 37:02.013
and want to be seen
as human beings

37:02.055 --> 37:04.641
and not as Black people.

37:08.019 --> 37:12.232
David Croland:
Donyale started
to work immediately.

37:12.315 --> 37:14.484
They all wanted her.

37:14.567 --> 37:17.904
There wasn't
a photographer with eyesight
that didn't want her.

37:17.987 --> 37:19.739
I mean, look at her.

37:19.823 --> 37:22.742
Omar: She hung
around with Mia Farrow.

37:22.826 --> 37:25.120
She hung around
with the Rolling Stones.

37:25.203 --> 37:27.539
She hung around with everybody

37:27.622 --> 37:33.003
who was beginning
to be well-known in London
in the '60s.

37:33.712 --> 37:35.255
David Croland:
She didn't have a chance

37:35.338 --> 37:37.549
to become
the "it girl" of New York City

37:37.590 --> 37:39.843
because of the rejection,

37:39.926 --> 37:44.180
but when she hit London,
they couldn't deal with it.

37:44.222 --> 37:45.390
They loved her so much.

37:45.473 --> 37:49.519
And now, the lovely Luna.

37:49.602 --> 37:53.064
(applause)

37:53.106 --> 37:54.566
Dream:
"Back in Detroit,

37:54.649 --> 37:57.193
"I wasn't considered
beautiful or anything.

37:57.277 --> 38:00.447
"I was always too tall,
too freaky-looking.

38:00.530 --> 38:05.410
"Nobody ever gave me a chance,
but look at me now.

38:05.452 --> 38:07.412
Here, I'm different."

38:07.454 --> 38:10.415
-(upbeat music playing)
-(crowd applauding)

38:10.498 --> 38:15.128
1966 is the banner year
for Donyale Luna.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.798
We have an incredible
spread in "Paris Match."

38:18.882 --> 38:20.967
No one's ever heard of this,
a, a Black woman

38:21.051 --> 38:23.928
being featured
in one scene after another.

38:23.970 --> 38:25.805
I mean, it's just
kind of unprecedented.

38:25.889 --> 38:27.390
Zandra Rhodes:
Then Adel Rootstein

38:27.432 --> 38:29.934
made the wonderful
mannequin of her,

38:30.018 --> 38:33.605
which was sort of
very leggy and very army,

38:33.646 --> 38:36.441
and, I mean, they'd never
been done like that before.

38:36.483 --> 38:37.984
They were wonderful.

38:38.068 --> 38:41.654
She's in conversation
with people like John Lennon.

38:41.738 --> 38:46.368
She's dating Brian Jones
of the Rolling Stones
at one point.

38:46.451 --> 38:48.370
(indistinct chatter)

38:48.620 --> 38:51.539
I think you're,
you're very sexy.

38:51.623 --> 38:54.459
Dr. Powell: She's also
dating Klaus Kinski. (laughs)

38:54.501 --> 38:56.586
Are you good in bed?

38:56.628 --> 38:58.463
Dr. Powell:
"Time" magazine calls her

38:58.505 --> 39:03.134
"the most extraordinary
evocation of the negro
that we've ever seen,"

39:03.176 --> 39:05.929
and it-- I mean, we're using
a lot of superlatives here

39:05.970 --> 39:08.098
because I think people
were kind of taken aback

39:08.139 --> 39:10.475
by the splash that she makes.

39:11.226 --> 39:14.521
The girl of the moment
is Donyale Luna.

39:14.604 --> 39:16.272
Dream:
"If I'd seen something like me

39:16.314 --> 39:17.524
"in a magazine as a child,

39:17.607 --> 39:20.151
"I would have died laughing.

39:20.193 --> 39:22.320
"I have skinny arms and legs

39:22.404 --> 39:25.532
and I'm bloody tall,
but so what?"

39:26.324 --> 39:29.202
When I first saw Donyale Luna,

39:29.285 --> 39:31.287
she was standing on top

39:31.329 --> 39:34.249
of a baby
grand piano in the water.

39:34.332 --> 39:37.460
Her legs were extremely long,

39:37.502 --> 39:40.672
and her arms
were extremely long,

39:40.714 --> 39:43.675
and I just thought,
"Is she a fairy?

39:43.717 --> 39:45.593
Is she real?
Is that a real--"

39:45.677 --> 39:47.846
I'd never seen
anyone like that.

39:47.929 --> 39:51.850
I just can't say enough
about how beautiful she was.

39:51.933 --> 39:53.309
She was a star.

39:53.351 --> 39:56.021
I mean, she stopped traffic.

39:56.104 --> 39:59.149
She had that aura about her.

40:00.358 --> 40:03.028
She is at the very apex

40:03.069 --> 40:07.365
of everything that is
most exciting in London

40:07.449 --> 40:09.576
in a moment when, globally,

40:09.659 --> 40:13.496
that was the most exciting
place to be on so many levels.

40:13.538 --> 40:16.124
Fashion aspect of that
is very much exemplified

40:16.207 --> 40:18.376
by the movie "Blow-Up,"

40:18.418 --> 40:21.880
and Donyale Luna
is totally there.

40:21.921 --> 40:25.508
Thomas:
Come on. Come on,
work, work, work.

40:25.550 --> 40:28.803
Hamish:
You have cameos
from the great models

40:28.845 --> 40:29.804
of the moment,

40:29.888 --> 40:31.473
and you have David Hemmings,

40:31.556 --> 40:35.560
who is, basically,
impersonating David Bailey.

40:39.564 --> 40:43.109
I like fashion photography
because it was the,

40:43.193 --> 40:45.195
in those days, it was
the only way you could be

40:45.236 --> 40:46.738
a bit creative in photography.

40:47.739 --> 40:49.074
By the time I was 22,

40:49.157 --> 40:51.993
I was doing covers
for "British Vogue,"

40:52.077 --> 40:55.455
and, uh, I used to have
much more power in those days.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.916
When it came to America,
America used to get

40:57.999 --> 41:00.502
three photographers
to do three different shots,

41:00.585 --> 41:02.295
and then they
put them all on the screen

41:02.379 --> 41:03.963
and get a psychiatrist
to look at them

41:04.047 --> 41:05.924
and to see which one
they should publish.

41:06.007 --> 41:08.885
But in England,
we didn't do that.

41:09.552 --> 41:12.806
I just started shooting
girls I liked, really.

41:15.141 --> 41:17.977
Just stand with your legs
apart and face me. No, no.

41:18.061 --> 41:21.356
Hamish:
David Bailey is
this very scrappy,

41:21.439 --> 41:23.108
kind of, London kid

41:23.149 --> 41:25.777
who completely transformed

41:25.819 --> 41:28.905
the whole idea
of beauty and fashion

41:28.947 --> 41:32.117
and how you bring
a magazine to life.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.328
Good girl. That's lovely.
Hang about, this is marvelous.

41:35.412 --> 41:36.955
Good. Open your mouth slightly.

41:37.038 --> 41:41.292
David Bailey really is "it,"
and if he's photographing you,

41:41.376 --> 41:43.169
that is the ultimate
consecration,

41:43.253 --> 41:47.632
and the opportunity
for a model like Donyale

41:47.716 --> 41:52.637
to reset the paradigm
of what beauty can be.

41:52.679 --> 41:54.055
(camera shutter clicks)

41:54.139 --> 41:56.558
David Bailey:
This is Donyale Luna.

41:57.517 --> 41:59.644
Here's the c-- Here's the cover.

42:01.521 --> 42:03.940
It's printed
a bit dark, I think,

42:03.982 --> 42:08.278
but, uh, she looks
great, doesn't she?

42:11.865 --> 42:14.117
She was perfect
for the picture.

42:15.285 --> 42:17.162
It's as good as it gets.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.832
Constance:
I was stunned.

42:20.915 --> 42:23.376
My breath was just taken away.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.713
This woman was
the first Black model

42:26.796 --> 42:29.507
to be on the cover of "Vogue."

42:30.175 --> 42:34.679
The momentousness of this
cannot be understated.

42:35.430 --> 42:37.849
Beverly Johnson:
Being on the cover
of "Vogue" magazine

42:37.932 --> 42:41.019
is our gold medal
in the Olympics.

42:41.061 --> 42:45.190
It's our Oscar
in the world of acting.

42:46.191 --> 42:48.735
It's achieving
that "Vogue" cover

42:48.818 --> 42:52.655
puts you at the top
of the modeling profession.

42:54.657 --> 42:56.785
Hamish:
She kind of leaps
out of the page

42:56.868 --> 43:01.414
because she's
this extraordinarily
beautiful Black woman,

43:01.498 --> 43:03.124
and there's just simply was

43:03.208 --> 43:05.710
no Black and brown
representation at all

43:05.794 --> 43:08.046
in the pages
of a magazine like that.

43:09.714 --> 43:11.633
I didn't even think
about being Black.

43:11.716 --> 43:13.176
She was just someone
that looked beautiful,

43:13.218 --> 43:15.303
and I thought she'd
be great for a picture.

43:15.387 --> 43:18.723
I mean... it wasn't, uh--

43:18.765 --> 43:20.558
I didn't have
an angst about it

43:20.600 --> 43:23.478
or... I never thought
about her being Black,
actually.

43:23.561 --> 43:25.063
I just did it.

43:25.980 --> 43:28.566
I always thought she was Indian,
I didn't think she was Negroid.

43:28.650 --> 43:31.403
But anyway, I think
she's beautiful, isn't she?

43:35.740 --> 43:40.161
Producer:
Did she ever talk to you
about racism in the industry?

43:40.245 --> 43:43.581
Not really, no. Uh-uh.

43:43.623 --> 43:46.084
Because we were
too busy havin' fun,

43:46.126 --> 43:50.005
and, (chuckles) and
smokin' a lotta weed, yeah.

43:51.548 --> 43:54.801
In Europe, I mean,
she was a sensation.

43:54.884 --> 43:57.846
And when you get
that kind of adulation

43:57.929 --> 44:02.392
and when you get
that recognition... you say,

44:02.434 --> 44:07.230
you, you, you, you
put a finger to America,
you know what I'm saying?

44:07.272 --> 44:08.773
(dogs barking)

44:08.857 --> 44:11.776
(protestors shouting)

44:15.113 --> 44:19.534
Dr. Powell:
Looking at Donyale Luna,
uh, in retrospect,

44:19.617 --> 44:23.747
one might wonder
why she wasn't

44:23.788 --> 44:30.295
as racially, um, proactive
as we would want her to be.

44:31.046 --> 44:34.799
Because the backdrop of this
is the Civil Rights Movement.

44:34.883 --> 44:38.803
The backdrop of this
is African independence,

44:38.845 --> 44:41.306
and yet Donyale Luna's
not a part of that.

44:42.807 --> 44:45.268
When we go back
to the interviews

44:45.310 --> 44:47.228
during this time period

44:47.312 --> 44:50.231
where, um, people are asking
her about her identity,

44:50.315 --> 44:52.650
asking her about
the Civil Rights Movement,

44:52.692 --> 44:54.444
she's incredibly evasive.

44:54.861 --> 44:57.364
Interviewer:
You have the most
spectacular blue eyes.

44:57.447 --> 44:58.573
Where do they come from?

44:58.656 --> 45:00.825
That's a secret.

45:02.535 --> 45:04.704
Dr. Powell:
She talks about blondes

45:04.788 --> 45:06.623
and blue-eyed models

45:06.664 --> 45:10.001
and how God did not
make her, um, like that,

45:10.085 --> 45:13.463
and that, um,
she wishes that, um,

45:13.505 --> 45:18.134
that, that, that she was white
and, and blonde and blue-eyed.

45:20.011 --> 45:23.181
Constance:
What does that mean?

45:23.264 --> 45:26.685
She's a Black girl
from Detroit,

45:26.768 --> 45:28.895
and what's wrong with that?

45:28.978 --> 45:30.980
Not a darn thing.

45:32.357 --> 45:34.776
Dr. Powell:
Many people interpret this as

45:34.859 --> 45:38.780
a kind of a disavowal
and a refusal,

45:38.863 --> 45:41.658
that she didn't realize
and recognize herself

45:41.700 --> 45:43.535
as, as a woman of color.

45:45.704 --> 45:49.582
Constance: There were people
whose lives were being taken.

45:49.666 --> 45:53.753
There were people who
were being brutalized
by the police.

45:53.837 --> 45:55.797
There were people
who were being shot,

45:55.880 --> 45:57.799
and that was happening

45:57.882 --> 46:01.928
while Donyale was
living this fabulous life.

46:02.012 --> 46:03.638
(protestors shouting)

46:03.722 --> 46:05.557
Dream:
"I've been described as being

46:05.640 --> 46:10.145
"both a white person
and a Negro.

46:10.228 --> 46:14.149
Whatever people
want to think, they can."

46:21.948 --> 46:24.367
(projector rattling)

46:24.409 --> 46:27.579
Dream:
"The little girl became famous

46:27.620 --> 46:31.916
"and again felt unpure love.

46:31.958 --> 46:33.877
"But for the first time,

46:33.918 --> 46:35.837
"she met freaks like her

46:35.920 --> 46:38.006
"in heart and mind.

46:38.089 --> 46:41.259
"They showed her colors
of other worlds,

46:41.301 --> 46:44.304
"taught her of the ways
of human beings,

46:44.387 --> 46:47.974
and of what little
they knew of gods."

46:52.103 --> 46:53.980
Juan Fernandez:
There's a lot of other girls

46:54.064 --> 46:55.565
that have come around...

46:57.025 --> 46:59.319
but there was one goddess.

46:59.402 --> 47:01.237
There was one queen.

47:01.279 --> 47:04.407
And that was Luna.

47:07.786 --> 47:12.290
We realized that we had been
together for many lifetime.

47:12.332 --> 47:16.378
We were brothers
from another life.

47:16.461 --> 47:21.049
We worked together,
we played together,
we laughed,

47:21.132 --> 47:23.927
we cried, we talked.

47:23.968 --> 47:27.472
We never made love.
It was not about sex.

47:29.015 --> 47:31.518
Donyale was a genius.

47:31.601 --> 47:34.729
Let's talk about
the images that she
created for "Playboy."

47:34.813 --> 47:38.733
It was just a, a magazine
that is all tits and ass.

47:38.817 --> 47:40.443
I mean, she had wings,

47:40.485 --> 47:41.820
and she was having fire

47:41.861 --> 47:43.571
come out of her vagina.

47:43.655 --> 47:45.323
I mean, it's, like--

47:45.407 --> 47:47.909
they were like,
"Ah, scandalous!"

47:47.992 --> 47:50.662
(ethereal voices singing)

47:55.333 --> 47:57.502
David Croland:
London was incredible.

47:57.544 --> 48:01.631
And then when she
was done with London,
she went to Paris.

48:03.049 --> 48:06.177
She was "it."

48:06.219 --> 48:09.806
But I didn't know until
I got there in '67, to Paris,

48:09.848 --> 48:13.435
uh... the magnitude of it.

48:15.311 --> 48:19.357
I see Donyale Luna
coming down the street.

48:19.399 --> 48:23.028
She said, "Baby,
what are you doing here?"

48:23.069 --> 48:24.988
I said, "Havin' a coffee."

48:25.989 --> 48:30.201
And, uh,
we moved in the next day,

48:30.243 --> 48:33.705
and became roommates...
like that.

48:33.788 --> 48:36.166
(relaxing jazz music playing)

48:37.876 --> 48:40.378
Our diet was insane.

48:40.420 --> 48:44.674
Mars bars, Coca-Cola,
and that's it.

48:44.716 --> 48:46.259
Eating was not a priority.

48:46.343 --> 48:49.220
Drinking was,
and getting high was.

48:49.262 --> 48:50.680
By the way, Donyale Luna,

48:50.722 --> 48:53.600
no one rolled a joint
the way Donyale Luna rolled.

48:53.683 --> 48:56.394
One day at the apartment
in Paris, she was going--

48:56.436 --> 48:59.439
having a ball up in the air,
and I can't stand sports.

48:59.522 --> 49:01.566
She's throwing
this ball up in the air,

49:01.649 --> 49:05.111
big, black ball, like this,
like a, like a softball,

49:05.195 --> 49:07.989
and she throws the ball at me,
and of course, I went like this,

49:08.073 --> 49:09.908
and she said, "Why didn't
you catch it, baby?"

49:09.949 --> 49:13.536
I said,
"I don't like playin' ball."
She goes, "It's not a ball."

49:13.578 --> 49:17.374
It was a ball of black hash.

49:17.415 --> 49:22.212
We're talking thousands
and thousands... like this.

49:22.253 --> 49:24.005
I said,
"Where'd you get that?"

49:24.089 --> 49:26.174
"Oh, baby, a friend
of mine gave it to me."

49:26.257 --> 49:28.093
Friends gave her a lot
because, you know,

49:28.176 --> 49:29.761
they wanted to be her friend.

49:29.844 --> 49:31.971
(David chuckles)

49:32.764 --> 49:35.767
(intense jazz music playing)

49:35.850 --> 49:37.560
Narrator:
More than 40 years ago,

49:37.602 --> 49:40.980
he presented the world
with a new idea
in men's clothing.

49:41.064 --> 49:43.066
Forty-one liqueur glasses,

49:43.108 --> 49:45.694
each containing
crème de menthe, a fly,

49:45.777 --> 49:47.195
and a straw.

49:47.278 --> 49:51.324
This, he said,
was his aphrodisiac jacket.

49:52.242 --> 49:56.287
Dr. Powell:
Donyale Luna famously says,
"Modeling was just a fluke.

49:56.329 --> 49:58.665
Really what I wanna be
is an actress."

50:01.668 --> 50:04.546
That guy with the hair.

50:04.629 --> 50:06.297
What about him?

50:06.381 --> 50:07.799
Dr. Powell:
Deep down in her heart,

50:07.882 --> 50:09.175
she has this burning desire

50:09.259 --> 50:12.053
to be on stage and in film.

50:12.762 --> 50:16.057
She is aware of herself
as another kind of beauty,

50:16.141 --> 50:18.685
as, as this extraordinary
kind of figure,

50:18.768 --> 50:21.062
but she's also seeing
the possibilities

50:21.146 --> 50:23.273
of being a part
of conversations

50:23.314 --> 50:26.109
around new art,
around performativity

50:26.151 --> 50:28.194
as, as an artistic statement.

50:28.278 --> 50:31.489
(playing modern jazz music)

50:39.039 --> 50:42.834
Juan:
I worked with Salvador Dalí,

50:42.876 --> 50:46.671
El Divino,
for almost seven years.

50:46.755 --> 50:49.090
(chuckles)

50:49.174 --> 50:54.262
Ahh! Who was, uh, Salvador Dalí?

50:54.804 --> 51:01.811
The most original,
eccentric man I've ever met.

51:01.978 --> 51:05.482
Obsessed
with entertaining himself,

51:05.523 --> 51:10.070
he wanted to be surrounded
by things that were beautiful.

51:12.072 --> 51:14.324
David Croland:
Dalí loved her.

51:14.366 --> 51:16.117
And then the day she came home

51:16.201 --> 51:18.661
wearing the dress
that Dalí drew on her,

51:18.703 --> 51:21.790
she comes in, I said,
"Where'd you get that dress?"

51:21.873 --> 51:25.293
She said, "Oh, it's a drawing
Dalí did of me on the dress."

51:25.377 --> 51:29.589
I said, "Put that in a, a box
and send it over to the Louvre.

51:29.673 --> 51:31.216
That's a piece of art."

51:31.299 --> 51:35.595
She goes, "You think so?"
I said, "No. I don't think so,
I know so."

51:35.679 --> 51:37.305
(crew chatting)

51:37.389 --> 51:41.059
One time, she came home
with cuts all over her arms.

51:41.101 --> 51:42.519
Ow!

51:42.560 --> 51:44.729
David Croland:
I said, "Where were you?"

51:44.813 --> 51:47.399
She said,
"Oh, baby, I just filmed, uh,

51:47.440 --> 51:49.401
'Qui etes-vous,
Polly Maggoo?'"

51:49.484 --> 51:52.612
"Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?"
with, uh, William Klein.

51:52.696 --> 51:54.406
Dr. Powell:
"Qui etes-vous,
Polly Maggoo?"

51:54.447 --> 51:57.826
"Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?"

51:57.909 --> 51:59.744
The spoof on the fashion world

51:59.786 --> 52:02.747
and all of these
kind of fashion mavens.

52:02.831 --> 52:04.416
People like Diana Vreeland,

52:04.499 --> 52:07.460
uh, the famous, um,
fashion editor at, at "Vogue,"

52:07.544 --> 52:09.754
who would be mesmerized
and blown away

52:09.796 --> 52:11.840
when they see
an extraordinary girl

52:11.923 --> 52:14.759
and would decide
that she would be
the girl of the moment.

52:14.843 --> 52:16.678
Magnifique!

52:16.761 --> 52:20.932
(chorus singing)

52:22.058 --> 52:24.561
Constance:
Diana Vreeland was

52:24.602 --> 52:31.109
the quintessential fashion
editor for American "Vogue."

52:31.192 --> 52:33.862
She was very
well-versed in style.

52:33.945 --> 52:36.281
She had very strong opinions.

52:36.364 --> 52:39.868
She looked eccentric,
she acted eccentric,

52:39.951 --> 52:44.372
and that only served to boost

52:44.456 --> 52:47.083
her mystique and her power.

52:47.125 --> 52:49.919
What she said mattered.

52:52.547 --> 52:55.175
One of the things
she was most famous for

52:55.258 --> 53:00.305
is her extravagant,
over-the-top photo shoots.

53:00.388 --> 53:05.352
And one of the most famous
was "The Great Fur Caravan,"

53:05.435 --> 53:08.521
and she created it
with Richard Avedon in mind.

53:08.605 --> 53:11.941
He was the person
she wanted to shoot it,
no one else.

53:13.735 --> 53:16.196
This was one
of the major shoots.

53:16.279 --> 53:19.449
It's said to be one
of the most expensive.

53:19.491 --> 53:23.912
They were all to fly
to Japan to shoot it,

53:23.995 --> 53:27.582
and Diana Vreeland
gets Richard into her office

53:27.665 --> 53:30.835
and says, "Here's what
I'd love you to do."

53:30.877 --> 53:36.007
And he says, "I have
the perfect model in mind."

53:37.133 --> 53:40.428
And that person
was Donyale Luna.

53:42.430 --> 53:45.350
Gideon:
Avedon still believed
in Donyale Luna

53:45.433 --> 53:47.477
when he went
to American "Vogue,"

53:47.519 --> 53:51.981
so he did a test shoot
to present to them,

53:52.065 --> 53:54.567
so they won't
be able to refuse.

53:54.651 --> 53:59.197
I mean, they did a great shot
of her in a Paco Rabanne dress,

53:59.280 --> 54:03.535
which was absolutely
beautiful, beautiful.

54:07.038 --> 54:08.957
And that was rejected.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.375
Uh...

54:11.459 --> 54:14.671
they were nuts.
I mean, I can't explain.

54:14.713 --> 54:18.383
There's no rhyme or reason
because it was a beautiful
photograph.

54:18.425 --> 54:21.386
Rejected by American "Vogue."

54:21.469 --> 54:24.055
Too extreme
for American "Vogue,"

54:24.097 --> 54:26.808
and this is a-another question
I'll ask Mrs. Vreeland,

54:26.891 --> 54:30.562
who made my career, by the way,
as a-- not as a model,

54:30.645 --> 54:32.480
I was a model before I met her,

54:32.564 --> 54:34.566
as an artist,
she was incredible.

54:34.607 --> 54:37.777
But she thought Donyale
was too extreme for "Vogue."

54:37.861 --> 54:39.946
And I-I just have
to repeat that.

54:40.030 --> 54:42.449
Too extreme for "Vogue?"
Are you kidding me?

54:42.532 --> 54:46.411
Have you met Veruschka
who you're using all the time?

54:46.494 --> 54:49.622
It was because she was Black.
I'm sure of it.

54:53.626 --> 54:56.838
I feel like Donyale Luna's
being was discounted

54:56.921 --> 54:59.132
because she was a Black
woman in the world,

54:59.215 --> 55:01.968
and she wasn't even regarded
as a full person by most.

55:02.052 --> 55:03.678
You know, this is a woman

55:03.762 --> 55:06.931
who upped herself from Detroit
and moves to New York.

55:06.973 --> 55:08.558
She then moves to Europe.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.727
She pushes to be on covers.

55:10.769 --> 55:15.523
She pushes to be
the best of her class...
and no one cares.

55:16.524 --> 55:19.361
How do you reconcile that?

55:23.114 --> 55:26.117
Dream:
"I know I'm beautiful.

55:26.159 --> 55:30.288
"I know I'm the best model.

55:30.372 --> 55:34.125
So, why aren't
I being photographed?"

55:38.254 --> 55:41.508
Producer:
This is from Avedon's archive.

55:41.591 --> 55:45.845
So, he said, "We began to get
closer to the day of departure,

55:45.929 --> 55:49.265
"and then the phone call came
that I knew was coming.

55:49.307 --> 55:54.479
"It was Diana,
who asked me to come
to her office, and I did.

55:54.562 --> 55:56.815
"I sat down,
a little small talk,

55:56.856 --> 56:01.820
"and then she said, 'Dick,
you can't take Luna to Japan.

56:01.903 --> 56:06.658
She's nobody's idea of what
anybody wants to look like.'"

56:07.659 --> 56:09.828
This is Dick's response.

56:09.911 --> 56:12.914
"I was so shocked
and sick to my stomach.

56:12.997 --> 56:16.459
"I said,
'Diana, she's extraordinary.'

56:16.501 --> 56:20.630
And she said,
'So was King Kong.'"

56:40.734 --> 56:43.445
Thank you for reading that.

56:47.741 --> 56:52.746
Do you think that they,
actually, told her about that?

56:52.829 --> 56:54.998
Producer:
I don't think he told her

56:55.040 --> 56:57.000
word for word what happened,

56:57.042 --> 57:02.213
but he also mentions
in the archive that
she wrote him a letter,

57:02.297 --> 57:04.799
which isn't here, unfortunately,

57:04.883 --> 57:09.387
but he says the letter
was really heartbreaking
because she said,

57:09.429 --> 57:12.640
"I know I'm good.
I know I work hard," um,

57:12.724 --> 57:17.228
"I don't understand," you know,
"why they won't hire me."

57:19.064 --> 57:20.523
Gonna make me cry.

57:20.565 --> 57:23.568
(cries, inaudible)

57:24.569 --> 57:27.822
It's, it's just not fair.

57:32.243 --> 57:34.746
(inhales)
I'm not a crier.

57:40.293 --> 57:42.087
I'm not a crier.

57:50.929 --> 57:52.764
I'm not a crier.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.483
It's accumulation
of all the pain.

58:04.567 --> 58:06.569
It's accumulation
of all the pain,

58:06.611 --> 58:08.905
all the answers to all--

58:16.454 --> 58:19.207
It's, it's, it's why
it hurts so bad.

58:21.418 --> 58:24.295
(contemplative music playing)

58:24.379 --> 58:26.089
Dream:
"Am I happy?

58:27.549 --> 58:29.801
"A little, I suppose.

58:32.012 --> 58:33.972
"Everything that
has happened to me

58:34.055 --> 58:37.183
"hasn't been easy
to get used to.

58:37.267 --> 58:41.146
"I used to think everything
was good and clear and right,

58:41.229 --> 58:44.024
"and now since I got
into the modeling business,

58:44.107 --> 58:48.361
"I've seen so much that
is ugly and unpleasant.

58:48.445 --> 58:53.533
I sometimes wish it had
never even started for me."

58:54.951 --> 58:58.663
Aurora: I think as humans,
we really all need acceptance.

58:58.705 --> 59:01.624
We need to feel valued.

59:01.666 --> 59:05.587
Here you have
an extraordinary woman,

59:05.670 --> 59:08.840
who was complicated,
as we all are.

59:08.882 --> 59:12.344
Beautiful, talented, vibrant,

59:12.427 --> 59:15.555
and she was not able to exist

59:15.638 --> 59:19.851
in this structure that
our society has created.

59:19.934 --> 59:24.022
We continued to tell her
that she was not good enough.

59:24.856 --> 59:26.691
David Bailey:
It was Liberman, actually,

59:26.733 --> 59:29.611
the American creative head
of Condé Nast.

59:29.694 --> 59:31.654
"Don't ever do pictures
like this again,

59:31.696 --> 59:33.865
otherwise, you'll never
work for 'Vogue' again."

59:34.866 --> 59:37.118
For ages, I thought that
he didn't like 'em 'cause

59:37.202 --> 59:39.704
they were two girls
in the pictures together,
but it wasn't.

59:39.746 --> 59:41.998
It was, uh-- He was talking
about them being Black,

59:42.040 --> 59:43.792
but he couldn't
come out and say it.

59:43.875 --> 59:47.879
Gideon:
So, here is the, the original
shot of Donyale

59:47.962 --> 59:50.715
for "Vogue" that was rejected.

59:50.799 --> 59:56.346
And then the reshoot
of the Paco Rabanne
on another girl,

59:56.429 --> 01:00:00.392
who was really not
our favorite girl,

01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:03.395
and you see the difference.

01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:08.817
Dream:
Yeah, I feel for her.

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:12.737
I never realized that, uh,

01:00:12.821 --> 01:00:18.034
it was so, like,
shut off for her there.

01:00:18.076 --> 01:00:22.080
So, I guess it was sad
because it resonated

01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:27.877
with, uh, that little girl that
no one thought it was beautiful.

01:00:31.297 --> 01:00:34.676
She must've felt, um...

01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:40.432
alone and, um, misunderstood
and not seen again.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.229
And it's hard to...

01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:53.028
to keep that connection to your
inner light when it's that hard.

01:00:55.613 --> 01:00:58.283
(ethereal music playing)

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.040
David Croland:
One day, we took acid
in our apartment...

01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:08.835
and Donyale had never
taken acid, not yet.

01:01:12.797 --> 01:01:16.801
So, we-we got high,
and, uh, I said

01:01:16.885 --> 01:01:20.513
to some of my friends,
I said, "Where's Donyale?"

01:01:20.597 --> 01:01:23.683
And no one knew where she was.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:25.935
She was gone.

01:01:29.105 --> 01:01:30.940
She surfaced.

01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:33.902
I said, "Where were you?"

01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:36.363
She said, "Oh, I was
walking around Paris."

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:38.740
I said, "For three days?!"

01:01:41.826 --> 01:01:45.580
She enjoyed, I think,
being, uh, detached
from being Donyale Luna,

01:01:45.663 --> 01:01:50.710
and the, the whole... staring
24/7 wherever she went.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:53.254
It made her feel free
to not have all this

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:57.258
peripheral objectification
around her.

01:01:57.342 --> 01:01:58.593
That was my take on it.

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:02.472
Uh, but the other take is
that she just liked being high.

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:04.182
Loved it.

01:02:09.145 --> 01:02:12.524
Dream:
"It's so difficult here.

01:02:12.607 --> 01:02:15.944
"I feel so alone.

01:02:16.027 --> 01:02:20.365
"Where is the place
where I feel at home?

01:02:20.448 --> 01:02:26.830
"And where is the place where,
finally, I'm seen for who I am

01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:31.251
and I am loved for who I am?"

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.219
(peaceful music playing)

01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:53.565
Dream:
"The gods saw that she was
ready to receive her mate.

01:02:57.193 --> 01:03:00.030
"On a magic moonlit night

01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:05.827
"came onto her side
a beautiful, bright
shining star.

01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:12.083
"And when she looked
into his eyes,

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:19.007
the little girl smiled
and said, 'My name is Luna.'"

01:03:32.937 --> 01:03:35.190
Luigi Cazzaniga:
So many memories.

01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:44.449
I was in Rome when I met
my wife, Donyale Luna.

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:47.077
It was 1969.

01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:51.331
I was a photographer
and she was a model.

01:03:53.124 --> 01:03:55.669
You wake up one morning
and you say, "Oh, my God,

01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:58.630
the poppies, they are out.
Let's go."

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:02.842
She was obsessed
with the pictures
to be perfect,

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:06.596
and she teach me
how to put my intention

01:04:06.638 --> 01:04:09.015
into when you do work.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:14.938
She spoke Italian very little,
maybe three words.

01:04:14.979 --> 01:04:16.481
And I didn't speak
much English

01:04:16.564 --> 01:04:19.150
because, in school,
I learned French.

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:23.697
If you want, I can tell you
how we communicated.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:28.159
Sometime, on LSD.

01:04:28.243 --> 01:04:29.452
(chuckles)

01:04:30.995 --> 01:04:32.997
We would be in a park

01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:35.000
and she would be far away,

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.002
and on LSD you see
all these things,

01:04:37.043 --> 01:04:41.548
these flowers
and psychedelic stuff.

01:04:41.631 --> 01:04:45.343
From far away
she would go,
"Chh, chh, chh,"

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:49.139
and then all around me
goes, "Pshhh," flowers!

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.016
(exotic music playing)

01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:53.226
And I would answer,
"Psh, psh!"

01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:57.355
(garbled transmission
from flight control)

01:04:57.397 --> 01:05:00.400
We were counterculture
'cause we, we smoked pot,

01:05:00.483 --> 01:05:03.737
we smoked hashish,
and we took LSD.

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.740
We loved to make love,

01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:11.703
and we loved to go out
and, uh, and, uh,
take pictures.

01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:19.794
Dream: "Luigi, my love,
my king, my everything.

01:05:19.878 --> 01:05:24.799
"I have come to you,
and with you,
I stay forever more.

01:05:24.883 --> 01:05:29.054
May all the gods bless us
and help us."

01:05:31.639 --> 01:05:33.224
(dramatic soundtrack playing)

01:05:33.266 --> 01:05:37.062
Dr. Powell:
By 1968, 1969,

01:05:37.103 --> 01:05:39.230
she's continuing
to do fashion,

01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:41.399
but that's not
important to her anymore.

01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:44.069
Now, she's really, really
interested in, kind of,

01:05:44.152 --> 01:05:47.781
avant-garde film
and avant-garde theater.

01:05:47.864 --> 01:05:49.741
(indistinct dialogue)

01:05:49.824 --> 01:05:52.369
Dr. Powell: And so, it was
no surprise that the films

01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:53.870
that she begins
to do after that

01:05:53.912 --> 01:05:56.498
kind of reflect
this kind of performative,

01:05:56.581 --> 01:05:59.417
conceptual
avant-garde activity.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:02.545
I'm thinking
about Federico Fellini's
"Satyricon."

01:06:02.587 --> 01:06:04.214
(giggles)

01:06:04.255 --> 01:06:06.424
Federico Fellini:
Look to me.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:07.676
More. Left.

01:06:07.759 --> 01:06:11.262
Dr. Powell: As well as
Carmelo Bene's, uh, "Salome."

01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:13.431
(speaking Italian)

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.104
...come la luna.

01:06:21.022 --> 01:06:22.982
(bell tolling)

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:28.071
Constance:
Donyale really seemed
to have found a home in Italy.

01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:30.657
She was working on her art,

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:35.537
and she was doing
beautifully composed
photographs.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.871
Almost like she became

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:39.290
a creative director herself.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:45.213
At a certain point, she wrote
a, a story called "Lunaflylaby."

01:06:45.296 --> 01:06:47.215
She wanted to make
a children book.

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:53.096
And, uh, the subject
was, practically,
the story of her life.

01:06:53.138 --> 01:06:55.432
And she expressed
in this book,

01:06:55.473 --> 01:06:58.810
lot of her, uh,
feeling about the world.

01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:03.314
Dream:
"Love is my law.

01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:06.901
"Truth is my worship.

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:11.948
"Beauty and perfection
is my life.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:14.242
Chick-a-boom."

01:07:14.325 --> 01:07:18.204
Livia Liverani:
I met Donyale Luna
when I was 16,

01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:22.792
and, uh, she was, um,

01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:25.420
a very special creature.

01:07:26.504 --> 01:07:30.050
I mean, I had
the feeling that I was

01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:33.845
in presence of a goddess, um.

01:07:33.928 --> 01:07:36.222
I mean, uh, Nefertiti,

01:07:36.306 --> 01:07:41.227
or someone who's
closer to the-- a deity.

01:07:42.937 --> 01:07:46.232
She was, I think, very happy

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:49.569
to be in her own environment

01:07:49.652 --> 01:07:52.197
and be free.

01:07:53.865 --> 01:07:57.911
I think she imagined

01:07:57.994 --> 01:08:01.456
that she could leave
the pain behind.

01:08:02.832 --> 01:08:06.795
Everything she had
experienced in childhood,

01:08:06.878 --> 01:08:11.216
but also
what she experienced
as a Black woman

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:13.635
in the fashion industry.

01:08:17.971 --> 01:08:21.267
I wonder if she, in fact,

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:24.270
at that point, had found peace,

01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:31.569
had found a place
to really rest her soul.

01:08:37.908 --> 01:08:39.786
Luigi:
We were together.

01:08:39.868 --> 01:08:41.871
We loved each other.

01:08:41.912 --> 01:08:44.791
So, we made the child.

01:08:44.874 --> 01:08:46.626
Everything went smooth,

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:51.715
and then after, uh,
she had the, the child,

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:53.675
and she was very happy,

01:08:53.758 --> 01:08:57.929
and I brought her a champagne
and flowers and a joint.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:02.350
(baby cooing)

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:08.982
(indistinct chatter)

01:09:09.064 --> 01:09:12.444
Dream:
"Today, a Dream was born.

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:15.029
"The daughter
of Luigi and Luna.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:19.408
"Wow! Chick-a-boom
and Hallelujah!

01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:22.620
"She's perfect in every way.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:27.917
Yes. A dream has
really come true."

01:09:29.294 --> 01:09:31.379
(contemplative music playing)

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:42.098
I don't have
vivid memories of her,

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:45.894
but I have flashes of her.

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:51.483
Like, if I close my eyes,

01:09:51.566 --> 01:09:57.989
I can see the color
of her skin, her freckles.

01:09:58.031 --> 01:10:01.868
I remember this part.

01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:04.829
I remember her hands.

01:10:04.913 --> 01:10:08.041
I guess those parts
that I was really close to

01:10:08.124 --> 01:10:10.502
when she was holding me.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:19.302
Her absence left a, a big
hole in everybody's life.

01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:22.222
I mean, in mine
and in my dad's life,

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:24.474
and we coped differently,

01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:27.686
and we coped, uh,
separately in a way

01:10:27.727 --> 01:10:30.605
because I was too young
to understand,

01:10:30.689 --> 01:10:31.731
and because he--

01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:35.694
it was too hard for him
to find the right words

01:10:35.777 --> 01:10:39.739
to share his, uh, feelings
and his emotions.

01:10:46.162 --> 01:10:47.914
(Luigi speaking Italian)

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.293
Ready?

01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:54.963
(speaking Italian)

01:10:58.675 --> 01:11:01.886
It was much different,
was much more wild,

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:06.558
and, um, it took me a year
and a half to build the house.

01:11:07.892 --> 01:11:11.396
Dream:
How was it when we
were here with her?

01:11:11.479 --> 01:11:14.524
We loved it. We loved it.
We have the kid.

01:11:14.566 --> 01:11:18.945
You had your r-room,
um, your special room.

01:11:19.029 --> 01:11:23.241
And, uh, I did
a lot of changing,
and she did too.

01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:25.326
She was, uh, breastfeeding you.

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:28.246
Here we, we planted the garden,

01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:31.291
and your mother,
she was vegetarian.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.251
-She was? Really?
-Mostly.

01:11:33.293 --> 01:11:36.129
But she also would like
a, a nice cheeseburger.

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:37.422
Dream:
Ah.

01:11:37.464 --> 01:11:40.216
I have this vision of her, um,

01:11:40.258 --> 01:11:44.220
with no makeup,
wearing a, a long skirt

01:11:44.262 --> 01:11:45.889
and, uh, sweeping the house.

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:50.352
That was very cute, and I-I
have that vision I remember.

01:11:50.435 --> 01:11:52.562
Dream:
Do you remember these stairs?

01:11:52.604 --> 01:11:54.397
Luigi:
I remember the stairs.

01:11:54.439 --> 01:11:56.691
The light,
it was only one lightbulb...

01:11:56.775 --> 01:11:58.568
-Uh-huh.
-...just hanging from a wire.

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.904
It was nothing like this.

01:12:00.945 --> 01:12:04.449
Dream:
And you did light brown
'cause she asked you to?

01:12:04.532 --> 01:12:07.952
I-If you didn't smoke
or do drugs, you were...

01:12:07.994 --> 01:12:11.081
-Square.
-...square, so that
was the thing.

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:18.505
Dream: "We found a home
in a tree in the magic forest.

01:12:18.588 --> 01:12:23.051
"Finally, our home
has risen higher to the sky

01:12:23.134 --> 01:12:28.056
and so, now, we begin
to learn how to fly."

01:12:30.725 --> 01:12:32.811
Livia:
This place was truly magic.

01:12:32.852 --> 01:12:36.398
She was, like,

01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:39.025
enlightening this place

01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:41.903
with her personality,

01:12:41.986 --> 01:12:44.572
was always music,

01:12:44.656 --> 01:12:47.951
always celebration, always--

01:12:47.992 --> 01:12:49.411
You know?

01:12:49.494 --> 01:12:55.458
She was so different
and in very beautiful way.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:59.004
So pure.
I mean, very pure soul.

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:02.257
She was just one to spread love,

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:08.263
and that's why I think
she was misunderstood
for most of the time.

01:13:08.346 --> 01:13:10.015
By who?

01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:11.975
By everyone.

01:13:17.522 --> 01:13:21.192
Luigi: My mother,
she didn't like, uh,

01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:23.069
my relation with Donyale.

01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:27.449
Because one evening
in the evening newspaper

01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:29.701
there was a big title
that says, "Donyale Luna,

01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:32.328
"she wants to rent a helicopter

01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:34.706
and spread marijuana
over the Vatican."

01:13:35.165 --> 01:13:37.292
My mom was super Catholic,

01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:41.880
so finished of the relation,
never ever forever and ever.

01:13:41.921 --> 01:13:45.175
"Goodbye
and, uh, go fuck yourself."
Something like that.

01:13:45.216 --> 01:13:47.427
Technically and practically.

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.389
So, uh, this was the situation.

01:13:51.473 --> 01:13:56.561
She never t-told me that,
that it was Luigi's family
that rejected her.

01:13:56.644 --> 01:14:01.399
She never told me that,
but I can see... it was that.

01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:06.446
Livia:
They were very
conservative family,

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:11.534
so they-they couldn't...

01:14:11.576 --> 01:14:13.536
not even...

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:19.668
not only accept, but understand
or understood who she was.

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.923
She wasn't allowed

01:14:24.964 --> 01:14:29.761
even to enter
Luigi's parents' house.

01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:38.812
Dream:
"Oh, dear gods,
it's so difficult here.

01:14:38.895 --> 01:14:43.274
"If you all only knew
what it feels like.

01:14:43.316 --> 01:14:46.736
It's so heartbreaking."

01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:49.572
Luigi:
We didn't have a, a job here

01:14:49.614 --> 01:14:52.450
or a, a way
to make money here.

01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:56.204
So, after you were born,
your grandma, she said,

01:14:56.287 --> 01:15:00.625
"What are you doing there
being just babysitting
and being a nurse?

01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:02.752
You have to go and find work."

01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:05.797
After a while I found
some work in the movie,

01:15:05.839 --> 01:15:08.466
and I don't
remember exactly,

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.510
but, you know,
at a certain point

01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:13.054
I spent more time
in the car than here.

01:15:14.639 --> 01:15:18.643
Livia:
I think, uh, he didn't realize

01:15:18.685 --> 01:15:24.607
how difficult it was
for Donyale and Dream

01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:28.987
be alone in the house
in the middle of the forest.

01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:34.492
This was very, very,
very difficult for her.

01:15:34.534 --> 01:15:38.329
-I'm sure it was.
-Yeah.

01:15:38.413 --> 01:15:42.459
She was truly lonely.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:48.173
And, uh, this loneliness, um...

01:15:48.214 --> 01:15:52.927
I think was... the problem.

01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:05.190
Donyale became very depressed.

01:16:09.694 --> 01:16:14.074
(baby talk, baby laughing)

01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:20.246
Dream went to stay
with Luigi's parents
after a while.

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:23.583
And, uh, yeah.

01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:29.631
That was...

01:16:29.714 --> 01:16:35.178
really like a sort
of torture, I think.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.681
So, she was very angry.

01:16:37.722 --> 01:16:41.393
I remember she was
very, very angry.

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:48.733
Dream: "Please, gods,
give me the strength and power

01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:53.988
to raise above this weakness
in my mind and body."

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:10.213
A mom and a daughter
are meant to stay together.

01:17:14.092 --> 01:17:19.764
When I had my children,
it was incredible.

01:17:19.806 --> 01:17:22.976
I never wanted them
to feel that

01:17:23.059 --> 01:17:26.688
when they needed me
I wasn't there.

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:31.776
Probably as a reflection
of, uh, knowing deep in my heart

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:35.030
how sad it is to be
apart from your mom.

01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:40.368
There's a, a sense
of, uh, separation

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:44.205
that kind of lies, um...

01:17:44.289 --> 01:17:50.128
in, in my heart...
almost a physical pain.

01:17:52.756 --> 01:17:55.467
I need to forgive the feeling

01:17:55.508 --> 01:17:59.262
of, uh, being left without her.

01:18:08.897 --> 01:18:13.818
Livia:
When I saw her in Rome,
she was changed.

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.738
Definitely, she had changed.

01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:21.743
She was, uh, sad. Very sad.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.665
Pat:
I'm somewhere in Rome,

01:18:27.707 --> 01:18:32.128
and everyone in the room
was totally quiet
when she came in.

01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:36.299
It was like something shut off
all the doors to the universe

01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:38.426
and it was just quiet.

01:18:39.761 --> 01:18:43.598
And I sat down
right across from her,

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:47.018
and this is where
something happened

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.939
that was very
heartbreaking for me.

01:18:51.022 --> 01:18:54.859
She said,
"I just had to talk to you.

01:18:54.943 --> 01:18:57.737
"I have to talk to someone.

01:18:59.155 --> 01:19:02.742
"I have to let
you know who I am.

01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:06.037
"I don't know if I can live
with this much longer.

01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:09.791
"I am so unhappy,
and I, I have to talk to you.

01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:11.001
"I have to talk to you.

01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:13.545
Can you save me?
Can you save me?"

01:19:13.586 --> 01:19:15.839
And I was, like, aston-- I was,

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.384
"My God, what's going on?
What's going on?"

01:19:19.467 --> 01:19:22.095
She's like,
"I'm just a girl from America.

01:19:22.178 --> 01:19:25.473
"I'm just a girl from America.

01:19:25.515 --> 01:19:27.350
Can you save me?
Can you save me?"

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:31.563
And I thought, "What the heck?
What am I gonna do?" You know?

01:19:31.646 --> 01:19:36.234
And it was Donyale Luna,
my goddess, the person I--

01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:39.404
You know, all this fantasy,
all of this stuff, you know,

01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:41.948
how she projects her life,
how she's a goddess.

01:19:42.032 --> 01:19:44.409
I mean, here I was with her

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:48.163
confessing her true
other self to me,

01:19:48.246 --> 01:19:51.541
and I was-- I didn't know--
"Just don't tell anybody.

01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:55.754
"Don't tell anybody
what I'm telling you,
but I need help.

01:19:55.837 --> 01:19:58.590
"I need help.
I'm, I'm in a lot of trouble.

01:19:58.631 --> 01:20:00.759
Nobody loves me."

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.720
I said, "Well, why don't
you just go home?"

01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:05.305
"I can't go home."

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:08.558
I said, "Go back to where
you came from, your home."

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.019
"I can't go there."

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:16.191
And the tragic thing is that
there was nothing I can do.

01:20:19.569 --> 01:20:22.655
You know, there was nothing
I could do to help her,

01:20:22.739 --> 01:20:24.991
and that's the tragic thing.

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:36.878
Omar:
She never was into heroin
(stammers) when I knew her.

01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:42.342
I mean, we-- maybe a little
weed, but nothing heavy.

01:20:44.636 --> 01:20:48.932
But I don't wanna paint
an ugly picture of her
'cause no, uh-uh.

01:20:48.973 --> 01:20:52.811
It was-- She was innocent
even doin' her drugs.

01:20:52.852 --> 01:20:55.772
There was some demon
in her that was--

01:20:55.814 --> 01:21:00.026
that caused her
to resort to drugs.

01:21:07.617 --> 01:21:11.162
Yeah. I--
When I think back
o-of that time,

01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:16.084
I could see it so vivid
in my mind's eye, you know?

01:21:21.297 --> 01:21:24.884
Just wasn't-- That's what--
where she shouldn't have been.

01:21:49.117 --> 01:21:51.077
Luigi:
We went to Rome.

01:21:52.412 --> 01:21:54.039
We didn't sleep
in the same place

01:21:54.122 --> 01:21:59.377
because of, uh, my mother
didn't wanna, uh, see her.

01:22:01.379 --> 01:22:05.050
So, I went with the kid
to my parents' house,

01:22:05.133 --> 01:22:08.178
and she went
to sleep with friends.

01:22:14.225 --> 01:22:19.230
I got a call from, uh, the woman
where she stayed, and, uh,

01:22:19.314 --> 01:22:22.692
and she said,
"Oh, she's passed away.
She's passed away."

01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:25.737
And I said, "No, no, no.
She probably took
a sleeping pill.

01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:27.238
She does like that sometime."

01:22:27.322 --> 01:22:29.574
She said,
"No, no, no, this really--

01:22:29.657 --> 01:22:33.244
I don't think she's doing
any good, I don't think
she's breathing."

01:22:33.328 --> 01:22:35.789
So, I took the car
and I run there.

01:22:35.872 --> 01:22:39.709
I arrive there
and at the same time
that I arrive,

01:22:39.751 --> 01:22:41.753
it was the 9-1-1.

01:22:41.961 --> 01:22:43.296
(siren wailing)

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.049
At the time,
we didn't have much money.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:49.844
So, we didn't have
no hashish, no marijuana.

01:22:49.928 --> 01:22:52.806
So, she probably found a lady

01:22:52.889 --> 01:22:54.265
that, uh, she said,

01:22:54.307 --> 01:22:59.145
"Oh, yeah, I can take this,"
and sh-she went.

01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:03.274
Donyale Luna,
whose exotic looks
helped her to become

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:07.195
one of the first successful
Black fashion models,
died last month.

01:23:07.278 --> 01:23:09.155
Donyale, whose
modeling assignments

01:23:09.239 --> 01:23:11.199
included
"Harper's Bazaar" and "Vogue,"

01:23:11.282 --> 01:23:12.617
died of heart failure.

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.244
She was 33.

01:23:21.292 --> 01:23:26.715
I got a phone call
from her husband, Luigi,

01:23:26.798 --> 01:23:31.761
and he was very distraught
and, you know, crying.

01:23:31.803 --> 01:23:34.014
Uh...

01:23:35.056 --> 01:23:39.144
he told me that,
uh, she had passed.

01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:46.693
He said she died
from a overdose.

01:23:46.776 --> 01:23:50.321
I said, "No, no, no, no, no.
That's, that's wrong."

01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:52.574
She didn't,
she didn't participate--

01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:57.078
She might participate,
but when she participated,
as far as I knew,

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.083
it was like a little taste
of this maybe, some wine,

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:05.170
some-- a little
w-weed, you know?

01:24:05.211 --> 01:24:07.756
But nothing, nothing addictive.

01:24:07.839 --> 01:24:11.176
She wasn't
addicted to anything
as far as I knew.

01:24:11.634 --> 01:24:16.556
I don't believe that it
was an overdose of drugs.

01:24:20.185 --> 01:24:23.104
She had just had a child,
for Christ's sakes.

01:24:24.564 --> 01:24:26.316
What mother...

01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:31.696
would create a situation

01:24:31.738 --> 01:24:34.074
that she ODs from drugs?

01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:40.413
I don't believe it.

01:24:45.335 --> 01:24:48.338
David Croland:
Donyale was not suicidal.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.423
She loved life.
She loved people.

01:24:50.507 --> 01:24:53.718
She loved... loved her life.

01:24:55.887 --> 01:24:58.223
Her heart just gave out.

01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:04.562
There's one scene
that I'm gonna tell you.

01:25:04.604 --> 01:25:06.731
This is, uh,
I never talked about it.

01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:11.903
But when we went to Rome,
um, the day before she died,

01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:14.447
and she got off
the car because, uh,

01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:18.201
and she took you in her arms
and then she crossed the street.

01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:20.704
She almost got
run over by a truck.

01:25:20.745 --> 01:25:24.749
And she went
to give you in the hands
of your babysitters.

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:29.462
So, that's, uh, and then,
and then she died the night,

01:25:29.546 --> 01:25:30.630
the same night.

01:25:30.714 --> 01:25:32.757
So, maybe she was
feeling something.

01:25:32.841 --> 01:25:34.592
Maybe she was, you know?

01:25:34.676 --> 01:25:36.553
Wow.

01:25:37.929 --> 01:25:41.016
And we were in front
of, uh, the grandparents' house?

01:25:41.099 --> 01:25:42.600
Yeah.

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:55.321
It sounds like, uh,
it was a sort of a...

01:25:56.865 --> 01:26:00.702
goodbye, in a way, to, to me.

01:26:00.785 --> 01:26:02.746
That's what I think.

01:26:02.787 --> 01:26:07.083
That's what I identify
as a goodbye, but, you know,

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:09.627
I don't think she wanted to die.

01:26:32.317 --> 01:26:36.279
Dream:
They told me a story
I could understand

01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:39.449
of how she passed,

01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:42.619
but it was actually the truth.

01:26:43.953 --> 01:26:49.584
She passed because
her heart was, uh, broken.

01:26:54.047 --> 01:26:56.299
I love you, Mom.

01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:00.720
And I know you do too.

01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:02.305
I know.

01:27:16.569 --> 01:27:22.534
What would you like to tell her
if she was here with us?

01:27:22.617 --> 01:27:24.786
Luigi:
"Why did you leave?"

01:27:27.539 --> 01:27:30.834
Dream:
And what do you think
she would answer?

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:32.460
(wind blowing softly)

01:27:32.544 --> 01:27:37.966
Luigi: Listen to the wind
and maybe she'll tell you why.

01:27:46.433 --> 01:27:48.935
Dream:
Maybe she just had to go.

01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:02.073
(projector rattling)

01:28:02.115 --> 01:28:04.951
(peaceful music playing)

01:28:10.373 --> 01:28:13.626
Kyle Hagler:
I hope that we see
Donyale Luna

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:17.339
as the personification
of the ability

01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:20.759
to be whoever you want to be.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.678
Beverly:
Of all the Black models,

01:28:23.762 --> 01:28:26.723
Donyale was the crown jewel.

01:28:26.765 --> 01:28:30.894
She was the one-- I'm getting
chills just talking about it,

01:28:31.102 --> 01:28:37.359
that invented herself
and made space for her artistry.

01:28:38.026 --> 01:28:42.280
Constance:
Image representation matters.

01:28:42.322 --> 01:28:45.200
Donyale Luna matters,

01:28:45.283 --> 01:28:48.661
and her legacy is so much more

01:28:48.745 --> 01:28:52.123
than what she accomplished
just within her career.

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.292
Dream:
Who is this one? Nonna?

01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:56.127
-Luna.
-Luna!

01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:57.796
"Once upon a time--"

01:28:57.837 --> 01:29:00.006
Kyle:
Some people might say

01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:01.841
that she should have done more

01:29:01.925 --> 01:29:05.345
in terms of the advocacy
of our people,

01:29:05.428 --> 01:29:08.473
but then others
could also say and argue

01:29:08.556 --> 01:29:13.603
that her being in these
predominantly white spaces

01:29:13.645 --> 01:29:16.314
was an act
of revolution in itself.

01:29:16.356 --> 01:29:17.982
Omar:
She was a star.

01:29:18.066 --> 01:29:22.028
She had her faults,
just like we all do, you know.

01:29:22.112 --> 01:29:24.572
But she was a role model

01:29:24.656 --> 01:29:27.450
for all the girls who have
come and passed through.

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:30.578
Aurora: We still see
her influence today.

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:33.164
Something about her
really resonates with us,

01:29:33.248 --> 01:29:36.001
you know,
because she was different.

01:29:36.042 --> 01:29:40.672
And I think that
a lot of people are still
inspired by her

01:29:40.755 --> 01:29:43.133
and they don't even realize it.

01:29:43.174 --> 01:29:47.345
Beverly:
I stand on the shoulders
of my ancestors.

01:29:47.554 --> 01:29:51.516
I stood on
Donyale Luna's shoulders

01:29:51.558 --> 01:29:53.643
to get where I am today.

01:29:53.685 --> 01:29:56.062
Dream:
I want my daughters to know

01:29:56.146 --> 01:30:01.234
who their grandma was
and how special she was.

01:30:01.317 --> 01:30:03.028
Aurora:
If there's anything

01:30:03.069 --> 01:30:05.613
that people can take away
from her story,

01:30:05.697 --> 01:30:08.867
it's that we cannot continue
to let society tell us

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:12.537
that we are not enough,
'cause it will take us down,

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:15.623
and we were born
more than enough.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.544
Omar:
She was one of a kind.

01:30:19.586 --> 01:30:21.921
Yeah, she was one of a kind.

01:30:23.631 --> 01:30:25.550
Donyale:
My complete name is

01:30:25.592 --> 01:30:30.180
Peggy Anna Donyale
Cazzaniga Luna Freeman,

01:30:30.221 --> 01:30:34.809
but, uh, I just cut it short
and use "Donyale Luna."

01:30:37.228 --> 01:30:40.148
