<b>1x09 - "Tiger Millionaire" </b>

00:28.621 --> 00:31.996
How could you possibly think
punching a blood polyp was a good idea?

00:31.998 --> 00:35.650
Look at all the gunk you got
on me! And look at Steven.

00:35.652 --> 00:39.868
- It's not so bad once you get used to it.
- See? He likes it!

00:39.903 --> 00:42.306
He certainly won't
like it when it hardens.

00:42.308 --> 00:45.994
- Uh... what? I'm gonna go wash.
- He shouldn't have been

00:45.996 --> 00:49.480
<i>- so close in the first place.
- How was I supposed to know they'd pop?</i>

00:49.482 --> 00:52.344
- Uh, guys?
- You're always putting us in danger

00:52.399 --> 00:58.289
with your little outbursts!
Oh, you are just... so... childish!

00:58.291 --> 01:00.409
Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget "reckless,"

01:00.410 --> 01:06.916
"vulgar," "loudmouth," and that's just
what makes me so awesome, right, Garnet?!

01:06.951 --> 01:09.954
Amethyst,
you are a Crystal Gem.

01:09.989 --> 01:15.713
- You need to act like it.
- Fine.

01:17.310 --> 01:21.012
I think we really
got through to her.

01:21.014 --> 01:25.934
- Right, Garnet?
- Guys?

01:30.417 --> 01:33.958
Huh? Wha?

01:35.981 --> 01:37.395
Amethyst?

01:41.204 --> 01:43.417
<i>For those of you
befuddled by the events of</i>

<i>athleticism, you're about to
see the Purple Puma</i>

<i>is the single, most-hated
wrestler in Beach City</i>

01:52.393 --> 01:56.381
<i>- underground's history!
- What?</i>

01:56.383 --> 01:58.983
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:58.985 --> 02:03.521
<i>Let's introduce his opponent ...
or should I say victim? </i>

02:03.523 --> 02:08.693
- The Lochness Blogster!
- I'm...

02:08.727 --> 02:12.710
going to end your reign of terror!
Yaah!

02:13.667 --> 02:14.399
- Ugh.
- Well, now, that ... that was quick.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.668
<i>Yeah, yeah, I don't like it,</i>

02:16.670 --> 02:18.369
<i>either, but hey, what do you do?</i>

02:21.075 --> 02:25.543
Amethyst!

02:25.545 --> 02:28.513
What are you doing here?

02:28.515 --> 02:32.416
- Are you a secret wrestler?
- Yeah.

02:32.418 --> 02:36.561
But how?
But when? But why?

02:36.596 --> 02:40.591
Come here.
Let me explain something to you.

02:40.593 --> 02:44.896
In the ring, nobody can tell me what to do!
And if they try, I hit 'em in

02:44.898 --> 02:48.666
- the face with a chair!
- And people... like that?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.803
Like it?
They love it!

02:51.805 --> 02:55.696
Well, they hate it, but it's
all part of the fun, you know?

02:55.697 --> 02:57.642
E-everyone here... gets that.

02:57.644 --> 03:01.446
You don't know what it's
like having Pearl and Garnet

03:01.448 --> 03:04.271
- on your back all the time!
- Are you kidding me?!

03:04.272 --> 03:08.197
Oh, Steven, I told you before
not to take peanut butter on missions!

03:08.198 --> 03:11.390
I'm not going to
say anything, but I expect you

03:11.391 --> 03:13.324
to understand that that was wrong.

03:13.326 --> 03:17.851
Let me be a wrestler with you!
I'm so stifled!

03:17.886 --> 03:20.932
Well, I haven't won
the tag-team belt yet, but you

03:20.934 --> 03:23.634
- can't tell Pearl and Garnet.
- Deal!

Tiger Millionaire ... rich, feline
industrialist from jungle island!

03:42.589 --> 03:47.709
Once the single child of the wealthy
Tiger family, he clawed out his own destiny

03:47.711 --> 03:51.929
- making money in the coconut mines.
- Wow! You just came up with all that?

03:51.931 --> 03:56.534
- Well, yeah. What's your back story?
- Pumas are cool.

03:56.536 --> 03:59.209
Uh...
W-we'll workshop that later.

03:59.244 --> 04:01.343
<i>Two local heroes in the ring tonight.</i>

04:01.378 --> 04:03.841
<i>They build hospitals for
the sick, and they build muscles</i>

04:03.843 --> 04:08.529

<i>Facing off against the
Purple Puma and our newest,</i>

04:13.236 --> 04:19.390
<i>mew-est competitor...
Tiger Millionaire!</i>

04:19.392 --> 04:24.101
- That little guy's gonna get creamed.
- From here, he kinda looks like Steven.

04:24.136 --> 04:27.999
- Yeah, right.
- Steven, wait.

04:28.001 --> 04:32.403
I'm just using you to get the tag-team
belt. I'll do all the actual fighting.

04:32.405 --> 04:37.308
- Do I still get to wear the costume?
- I don't care.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.877
Okay!

04:42.023 --> 04:44.232
<i>Ooh, a devastating move by Puma!</i>

04:44.234 --> 04:47.029
U-uh, Purple ...
Purple Puma! Look out!

04:47.064 --> 04:51.722
<i>What a gross misuse of safety
equipment and your tax dollars.</i>

04:51.724 --> 04:55.206
- That's not fair.
- It may not seem fair,

04:55.207 --> 04:59.075
<i>- but hey, anything goes in wrestling.
- It does?</i>

04:59.076 --> 05:01.077
<i>Oh, yes, it does!</i>

05:01.112 --> 05:04.964
Looks like this
Tiger's got to turn cheetah!

05:04.986 --> 05:07.939
<i>Hey, chunk truck!
I'll give you a million</i>

05:07.941 --> 05:12.276
- jungle bucks to throw the match!
- What's this? It looks like Tiger Millionaire

05:12.278 --> 05:16.280
- is offering a bribe!
- Why, we could fill 1,000 potholes with ...

05:16.282 --> 05:19.383
Oh, snap!
Did you see that?!

05:19.385 --> 05:22.520
Oh-h!

05:22.522 --> 05:26.524
<i>- Oh! I mean, just, wow.
- Way to go, Tiger!</i>

06:09.432 --> 06:11.518
Ye-eah!

06:12.353 --> 06:14.833
<i>Record-breaking heat tonight, folks.</i>

06:14.868 --> 06:18.138
<i>Could it be? Tiger Millionaire
has bought out our soda stand.</i>

06:18.173 --> 06:21.306
<i>Maybe he'll share with
his thirsty fa... oh!</i>

06:21.341 --> 06:24.052
<i>Now there's no sodas for anybody.</i>

06:24.087 --> 06:25.957
<i>Wha... and now he's
putting on galoshes?!</i>

06:25.992 --> 06:30.288
<i>Wow, folks. This is really
hard to watch. </i>

06:30.290 --> 06:33.405
Classic. Tiger! Hey, Tiger!
W-would you sign this?

06:33.440 --> 06:37.395
- It'd be so rad!
- You couldn't afford it!

06:37.397 --> 06:43.466
<i>Who-o-o-a.
Never thought I'd live to see the day </i>

06:43.501 --> 06:46.045
<i>when a contender
turned on his own fans.</i>

06:46.046 --> 06:48.589
I thought we
were just having fun!

06:48.590 --> 06:51.609
<i>Tiger Millionaire, you are the
cruelest creature on the planet!</i>

06:58.758 --> 07:02.320
<i>Hey, Tiger! Are you
ready to win our final match?!</i>

07:02.322 --> 07:08.793
Amethyst, am I... the cruelest
creature on the planet?

07:08.795 --> 07:14.223
Oh, Steven. Those are just words people
use to describe how they feel about you.

07:16.211 --> 07:21.154
Listen, Steven. You can't let
anyone make you feel like garbage.

07:21.189 --> 07:26.138
- Is that how you feel?
- I only feel how I want to feel.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.629
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, fans of wrestling,</i>

07:30.632 --> 07:34.691
<i>welcome to the tag-team
championship!</i>

07:34.726 --> 07:37.845
<i>In the ring tonight ... they've
stomped their way</i>

07:37.846 --> 07:40.491
<i>through the tournament and into
our hearts. Give it up, y'all.</i>

07:40.493 --> 07:46.965
<i>Give it up for Dashing Dave Doober
and Handsome Hank Hackleschmidt!</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:50.451
<i>Only one thing would
make these men look better, folks ...</i>

07:50.453 --> 07:53.745
<i>it's the tag-team belts! But...</i>

07:53.780 --> 07:56.907
<i>standing in their way, the
ruthless kings of the jungle.</i>

07:56.909 --> 08:00.711
<i>They'll eat your kids and
fire your parents! Oooh!</i>

08:00.713 --> 08:04.581
<i>Yes, it could only be...
the Purple Puma...</i>

08:04.583 --> 08:09.282
<i>...and Tiger Millionaire!</i>

08:09.317 --> 08:11.272
<i>Don't you dare hurt
those men, you monsters!</i>

08:11.274 --> 08:14.921
Man, people are
really hating on Tiger M.

08:14.959 --> 08:18.285
He's awful because
he hurt me specifically!

08:21.971 --> 08:23.974
Pearl? Uh, Garnet?

08:24.009 --> 08:29.236
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing? What is this?

08:29.267 --> 08:31.940
I thought we
could use some promotion.

08:31.941 --> 08:34.609
<i>Looks like we have some new opponents!</i>

08:34.610 --> 08:37.269
No, you don't!
This match is cancelled.

08:37.304 --> 08:39.283
- What?
- What? Why?

08:39.284 --> 08:42.886
Why?! I can't believe you've
been sneaking off to this ...

08:42.889 --> 08:46.726
this ... circus of violence!
And you!

08:46.761 --> 08:49.538
Using your gem powers on humans?

08:49.573 --> 08:51.228
It's not enough that
you're on my case all the time?

08:51.230 --> 08:55.343
- You have to ruin this for me, too?
- We're not here to fight.

08:55.378 --> 08:57.381
<i> Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

08:57.416 --> 09:00.019
- Steven, Amethyst...
- What?!

09:00.054 --> 09:04.292
- ...go back to the temple.
- I don't wanna!

09:06.245 --> 09:09.255
Don't do this.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.491
Guys! Stop!

09:27.166 --> 09:32.687
<i>Wait! I want to tell you
Purple Puma's back story.</i>

09:32.689 --> 09:35.582
<i>He was the wildest cat in the jungle ...</i>

09:35.583 --> 09:38.476
<i>so wild, the other
cats couldn't take it.</i>

09:38.478 --> 09:42.063
<i>So she ... I mean, he ...
went to look for somewhere</i>

09:42.064 --> 09:46.286
<i>he fit in ... somewhere
with other people who</i>

09:46.321 --> 09:49.409
- felt misunderstood.
- That really sounds like Steven.

09:49.444 --> 09:50.597
<i>- Shh!
- That's why we're all here ...</i>

09:50.598 --> 09:54.533
<i>to be wild and free and
body-slam each other </i>

09:54.568 --> 09:58.796
<i>and wear cool costumes and make
up nicknames, and ... and ...</i>

09:58.798 --> 10:02.817
<i>uh, so... can't we just... have this?</i>

10:02.818 --> 10:06.272
<i>Can't we just... wrestle?</i>

10:06.889 --> 10:08.672
<i>No.</i>

10:08.707 --> 10:10.630
<i>Because... we are...</i>

10:10.631 --> 10:15.440
<i>the notorious o-order of...
wrestling haters.</i>

10:15.475 --> 10:18.436
That's right.
Um... we want to stop

10:18.471 --> 10:23.796
<i>all wrestling everywhere!
You're going to let us destroy all wrestling?</i>

10:23.831 --> 10:27.418
You got to save wrestling!
Come on!

10:27.453 --> 10:29.576
Tiger! Puma!

10:29.648 --> 10:31.647
<i>Tiger! Puma!</i>

10:31.687 --> 10:33.247
We'll stop you!

10:33.249 --> 10:37.785
<i>What a stunning turnaround!
The jungle duo are fighting back!</i>

10:40.842 --> 10:44.241
<i>And they've taken down
Captain Square. But wait. Wait.</i>

10:44.243 --> 10:46.203
<i>It's the ... it's the
good-looking gang with a ladder!</i>

10:46.204 --> 10:48.503
<i>A-are they planning to steal the belt?</i>

10:48.538 --> 10:51.711
<i>No! Ooh, they're
actually helping Tiger up!</i>

10:51.746 --> 10:55.551
<i>- He's climbing an actual...
- Sorry for, um... sorry.</i>

10:55.586 --> 10:58.856
<i>- Same here.
- Tiger Millionaire has claimed</i>

10:58.891 --> 11:02.371
<i>the tag-team belts!
Tiger and Puma have won the</i>

11:02.406 --> 11:06.263
- championship and saved wrestling!
- Lars, I'm really confused.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.283
I love you, Tiger Millionaire.
