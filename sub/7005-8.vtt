00:00.833 --> 00:01.831
Let go of me!

00:01.833 --> 00:03.868
You gonna yell
for your mommy?

00:03.869 --> 00:06.804
No. Daddy!

00:08.907 --> 00:10.942
Hey, boys! Hey, hey,
hey, hey! Up! Up!

00:10.943 --> 00:13.378
Hey, stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop it!

00:13.379 --> 00:15.447
Remember what
I told you guys about
having laundry fights?

00:15.448 --> 00:18.450
If you're gonna have them,
let me in.

00:18.451 --> 00:21.786
Dad, mark got
his dirty clothes
all over my desk.

00:21.787 --> 00:24.288
He's a total pig.

00:24.289 --> 00:27.391
You think your roommate's a pig?
How do you think mine feels?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.666
Mark, what happened
to the research
for my history paper?

00:34.667 --> 00:38.503
I didn't touch it.
Mark, it's important.
I need that stuff.

00:38.504 --> 00:41.072
Let's look together.
It's gotta be in here someplace.

00:41.073 --> 00:43.141
What's it look like?

00:43.142 --> 00:45.977
It's a couple of articles
I clipped out
from the newspaper.

00:45.978 --> 00:48.746
Newspaper, newspaper...
Newspaper?

00:53.152 --> 00:56.287
Mark, how could you
do that?
I thought it was trash.

00:56.288 --> 00:58.457
Yeah. Well, it is now,
you little creep.
Ow!

00:58.458 --> 01:01.126
All right! Come on!
Break it up! Break it up!

01:01.127 --> 01:05.096
That's it, dad. I've had it.
I can't live with this
little dweeb anymore.

01:06.698 --> 01:08.533
Hey, it's not that bad.

01:11.337 --> 01:14.605
A little puddle in the middle
of it. You can still read
the outside of it.

01:14.606 --> 01:18.043
There you go. "the senate today
was rocked by scandal
as two members...

01:18.044 --> 01:22.180
<i>(gibberish)</i>

01:22.181 --> 01:24.249
Talk about
your yellow journalism.

02:18.905 --> 02:22.273
Uh-oh. Honey,
it's a school night.

02:24.877 --> 02:28.246
Maybe I can
teach you something.
All right.

02:28.247 --> 02:30.314
You know, if school
had been like this,

02:30.315 --> 02:33.552
Maybe I would've
paid more attention.

02:33.553 --> 02:34.886
<i>(knock on door)</i>

02:34.887 --> 02:37.922
Mom, dad, I gotta
talk to you.

02:37.923 --> 02:40.225
Get ahold of my people.
We'll have lunch
on Wednesday.

02:42.194 --> 02:44.361
Come in, randy.

02:45.964 --> 02:49.000
I can't sleep. Mark's making
that snoring sound again.

02:49.001 --> 02:52.036
<i>(imitates nasal snore)</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:55.940
It's the same sound
you make,

02:55.941 --> 02:59.244
Except there's more of
a phlegmy touch to yours.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.946
I gotta have my own room.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.581
Randy, it is
11:00 at night.

03:03.582 --> 03:06.818
Now, I promise,
tomorrow we'll set aside
some special time,

03:06.819 --> 03:09.620
And we'll sit down
and talk about it.

03:09.621 --> 03:12.890
In other words, you're hoping
I'll forget about it by then.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.329
Worked when you
were younger.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.065
Good night, sweetie.
Good night.

03:22.501 --> 03:24.769
Now, where were we?

03:24.770 --> 03:26.337
Back-to-school night.

03:28.373 --> 03:31.408
Hey, wait a minute.
What about the basement?

03:31.409 --> 03:34.445
I'm too old for that
hard cement floor.

03:36.115 --> 03:41.052
No. I could build him
a bedroom in the basement.

03:41.053 --> 03:44.255
Tim, we've talked
about this before.

03:44.256 --> 03:46.658
I don't want one of the boys
down there. It's too far away.

03:46.659 --> 03:50.595
I could put an intercom in.
You could nag
at the touch of a button.

03:54.267 --> 03:58.769
It is not just that.
It's cold. It's damp.
There's no light down there.

03:58.770 --> 04:02.207
Maybe it is now,
but you gotta picture it
the way I'm gonna make it.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.775
I'm picturing what it's like
every time you renovate.

04:04.776 --> 04:08.179
There's a big hole in the wall
and two paramedics.

04:08.180 --> 04:11.816
First of all, I'll make
no holes in the wall,
and you know what?

04:11.817 --> 04:15.453
It might be kind of cool
to see dave and biff again.

04:15.454 --> 04:17.588
Well, it's true that
it's been a disaster

04:17.589 --> 04:19.923
Putting randy and mark
together in the same room.

04:19.925 --> 04:23.661
That's exactly why we should
split them up and give him
his own room.

04:23.662 --> 04:26.097
I hate to admit this,

04:26.098 --> 04:29.533
But you might be... Right.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.905
Of course I'm right.
And the best part about it?

04:33.906 --> 04:35.940
I can make
a <i>tool time</i> remote
out of this.

04:35.941 --> 04:37.942
Every time we have to
build something,

04:37.943 --> 04:40.544
Why does <i>tool time</i>
have to be dragged over here?

04:40.545 --> 04:43.181
Because the house
is too heavy to drag over
to <i>tool time.</i>

04:45.885 --> 04:47.919
Welcome to a very special
<i>tool time -</i>

04:47.920 --> 04:49.687
Live from tim's basement.

04:49.688 --> 04:53.191
Now here he is,
the star of the show -
tim "the tool man" taylor.

04:53.192 --> 04:55.393
<i>(theme plays)</i>

05:01.400 --> 05:04.169
Hi. Thank you, heidi.
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.237
And you all know
my assistant al borland.

05:06.238 --> 05:09.407
Here on <i>tool time,</i>
we understand the needs
of a growing family.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.042
We're proud to present

05:11.043 --> 05:13.044
"converting your basement
to a bedroom for the middle son

05:13.045 --> 05:16.481
Who's not getting along
with the younger son" special.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.950
And here's tim's middle son
randy taylor.

05:18.951 --> 05:21.252
Hi. I'm randy.
Welcome to my room.

05:21.253 --> 05:24.622
Take off your shoes
and don't mess anything up.

05:24.623 --> 05:26.591
All right. All this week
on <i>tool time,</i>

05:26.592 --> 05:28.760
We'll be showing you
the step-by-step process

05:28.761 --> 05:30.762
Of building a room
in your basement.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.597
Right. And the first step
in any room conversion

05:32.598 --> 05:34.599
Is a close look
at the floor plan.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.103
And, al, you forgot
to put the stairway
in here. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

05:41.439 --> 05:44.308
Oh, yeah. There they are
right there.

05:44.309 --> 05:46.377
I came down
to get a football.

05:46.378 --> 05:48.513
That's ok. Come over here
and say hello.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.215
This is my older son
brad taylor.

05:51.216 --> 05:54.585
Hi. I want to say
that I think the older son
deserves the basement room.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.387
We're doing a show.

05:56.388 --> 05:58.589
It doesn't matter
what he thinks,
because he's a piece of...

05:58.590 --> 05:59.857
Randy!

05:59.858 --> 06:01.492
Hey! Don't give me
any more of your...

06:01.493 --> 06:04.562
Brad! You guys are becoming
a major pain in the...
Tim...

06:04.563 --> 06:07.097
Ok, we'll be right back
after these messages -

06:09.367 --> 06:11.235
Would you just cut it out,
you little...
Al!

06:11.236 --> 06:12.469
Oh, ok.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.140
Now, before we can
put up our framing,

06:16.141 --> 06:18.409
We need to attach this
2x4 nailer plate

06:18.410 --> 06:21.679
Which we will
secure directly into
the concrete foundation.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.581
For that, we'll need
a power fastener,

06:23.582 --> 06:26.250
And there's no better
fastener on the market than
binford's 6100. Heidi?

06:26.251 --> 06:28.319
Here you are, tim.
Look at that bad boy.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.056
Solid-steel construction,
22-caliber,
full 3-inch pin capacity.

06:32.057 --> 06:35.994
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

06:35.995 --> 06:39.097
Drive in your nails
about every 32 inches
or every other stud.

06:39.098 --> 06:43.267
All right, marv,
bring the camera in real close
and watch how this thing works.

06:43.268 --> 06:45.470
Huh?

06:45.471 --> 06:48.038
Not that close, marv.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.377
Well, you've seen
the progress so far.
What do you think?

06:53.378 --> 06:56.648
I like the room.
I'm just not crazy about
the idea of him down there.

06:56.649 --> 07:00.652
You gotta stop babying him.
Give him his independence,
turn him into a man.

07:00.653 --> 07:03.821
This is the beginning
of the end. Now he's living
in the basement.

07:03.822 --> 07:05.790
Tomorrow... England.

07:07.726 --> 07:09.761
How did he get to England?

07:09.762 --> 07:13.765
I always pictured randy
being a rhodes scholar.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.033
He doesn't need to go to England
to study roads.

07:16.034 --> 07:18.102
There's plenty of freeways
right here in town.

07:18.103 --> 07:21.773
He's just growing so fast.

07:21.774 --> 07:25.376
It seems like yesterday
that I brought him home
from the hospital.

07:25.377 --> 07:27.978
If you're talking
about last week,
that was me.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.417
He used to be
so attached to me.

07:33.418 --> 07:36.788
I couldn't leave a room
without him grabbing
onto my leg.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.790
I believe that was also me.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.962
Hi. Welcome back to <i>tool time.</i>

07:44.963 --> 07:47.765
One last nail,
and our dry wall
will be finished.

07:47.766 --> 07:48.866
Yeah.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.348
A little more spackle,

08:03.349 --> 08:05.783
One last nail,
and our dry wall's finished.

08:10.355 --> 08:12.823
Hey, randy.
Hey.

08:12.824 --> 08:15.325
Brad, I'm really sorry
the basement isn't bigger

08:15.326 --> 08:18.395
So we could each have
our own room.

08:18.396 --> 08:20.431
You're so full of it.

08:22.534 --> 08:24.334
You're absolutely right.

08:26.638 --> 08:28.605
Now we just
secure the shelf.

08:28.606 --> 08:30.607
Before you secure the shelf,

08:30.608 --> 08:33.410
Use your level to make sure
it's aligned properly.

08:33.412 --> 08:37.315
It is aligned properly.
I built this myself.
I used my eye.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.451
If it's level,
this ball won't roll.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.323
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

08:45.324 --> 08:48.192
All right,
on to the built-ins.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.800
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

08:59.871 --> 09:01.905
Yeah, michelle,
it's gonna be great.

09:01.906 --> 09:05.009
Yeah, it'll be like
having my own apartment.

09:05.010 --> 09:08.679
And I'm gonna be
as far away from my parents
as humanly possible...

09:12.183 --> 09:15.386
...Which is the one
truly sad thing about it.

09:22.361 --> 09:23.928
Ow!

09:26.298 --> 09:28.766
Welcome back to <i>tool time.</i>

09:28.767 --> 09:30.901
Now's the moment
we've been waiting for.

09:30.902 --> 09:34.572
That's right. Al is gonna
remove his flannel briefs
and sumo wrestle with his mom.

09:37.876 --> 09:41.446
May the best man win.
Go to it, al.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.449
Do you think
you'll ever get tired
of making fun of my mother?

09:46.318 --> 09:48.953
I... I see
no sign of it.

09:50.889 --> 09:52.656
Dad, my room?

09:52.657 --> 09:54.758
All right, marv,
get ready.

09:54.759 --> 09:56.861
Son, your new
basement room. Step in.

09:56.862 --> 10:00.831
<i>(♪ electric guitar fanfare)</i>

10:00.832 --> 10:02.933
Whoa. Dad,
this is great.

10:02.934 --> 10:06.137
A boy's bunker, a lad's pad,
a kid's castle...

10:06.138 --> 10:08.605
Hey, randy. It's my show,
ok? All right.

10:08.606 --> 10:10.707
Because of the small area,

10:10.708 --> 10:12.843
We used a lot of
space-saving features.
Right, al?

10:12.844 --> 10:15.512
That's right. Well,
we custom-built in this desk,

10:15.513 --> 10:18.115
And we used
an expanded steel
for the cabinet doors.

10:18.116 --> 10:20.117
Right. And look over here.

10:20.118 --> 10:22.686
A built-in bed
with storage units
just like this.

10:22.687 --> 10:26.390
We used custom-made steel tubing
1 1/4-inch thick.

10:26.391 --> 10:29.360
Marv, come over here.
I'm especially proud of this -

10:29.361 --> 10:33.730
My own design for an oversized
sliding pocket door.

10:33.731 --> 10:36.200
But wait
till you see this!

10:36.201 --> 10:38.302
What is it?

10:38.303 --> 10:42.039
All right. This is
a reverse laundry chute.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.242
You put your laundry in there,
it sucks it right up
to the garage...

10:47.446 --> 10:50.448
...Right next to
the washing machine.
Let me demonstrate.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.684
While al wasn't watching,
I deftly removed his underwear.

11:01.926 --> 11:04.996
Simply place them right here.
Al, press the button.

I know you're just gonna
talk about how great
your new room is.

14:11.315 --> 14:14.685
All I said was, "hi, brad."
see? There you go again.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.389
All right, brad.
You want the basement,
you can have it.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.659
Yeah, right.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.528
No, no, I'm serious.
I'll trade you rooms.

14:24.529 --> 14:27.498
All right,
what did dad screw up?

14:29.200 --> 14:32.636
Is the room tilted? Hey,
did the ceiling cave in?

14:32.637 --> 14:34.805
No, no. The room's fine.

14:34.806 --> 14:37.007
Morning, guys. What's up?
Nothin'.

14:37.008 --> 14:41.244
Actually, something is weird.
Randy wants to trade rooms
with me.

14:41.245 --> 14:42.914
What?

14:42.915 --> 14:45.048
Brad's unhappy,
mom's unhappy.

14:45.049 --> 14:47.918
Let's face it, dad, my
having this room is splitting
the whole family apart.

14:51.089 --> 14:52.924
What's the real reason?

14:52.925 --> 14:56.393
Why doesn't anybody
believe me? I'm trying
to do something nice.

14:56.394 --> 15:00.164
Maybe because that's
never happened before?

15:00.165 --> 15:02.967
We all put a lot of work
into this room for you.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.602
I know.
You scared down there?

15:05.603 --> 15:08.940
No! A guy tries
to do something nice
for his brother,

15:08.941 --> 15:11.342
And everybody
jumps all over him.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.077
Hi, sweetheart. How first night
in your new room?

15:13.078 --> 15:16.347
It was fine. Why does
everybody keep on asking me
about my room?

15:20.786 --> 15:24.221
Is it just me, or does randy
seem a little tense?

15:24.222 --> 15:28.893
I don't know what's going on.
I came down, and he's trying
to trade the room to brad.

15:28.894 --> 15:32.263
What?
Why would he do that?
Beats me.

15:38.103 --> 15:43.674
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what this means.

15:43.675 --> 15:46.010
You're cooking pillows
for breakfast again?

15:48.846 --> 15:52.383
No. This is randy's pillow.
He obviously hid it up here.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.518
Which means he slept up here,
which means he didn't sleep
down there,

15:54.519 --> 15:56.654
Which can only mean one thing.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.422
Absolutely.
What?

16:00.392 --> 16:03.393
He's too scared
to sleep in the basement.

16:03.394 --> 16:05.528
No. I asked him.
He said he wasn't scared.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.697
He won't admit it.
He'd be too embarrassed.

16:07.698 --> 16:09.866
I think I should be
the one to handle this.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.803
And what are you
gonna do about it?

16:12.804 --> 16:17.374
Maybe I should sleep down
there with him for a few nights
until he gets adjusted.

16:17.375 --> 16:18.776
Great idea.

16:20.478 --> 16:23.380
Then he'll have
a whole new set of problems.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.851
<i>(ticking)</i>

16:38.263 --> 16:40.130
<i>(whistling)</i>

16:56.047 --> 16:58.648
Excuse me, wilson.
What are you doing?

16:58.649 --> 17:01.151
Signaling the mother ship
to take you back
to your own planet?

17:04.622 --> 17:08.090
No, tim. I'm on
my annual owl prowl.

17:08.092 --> 17:10.593
<i>(whistling)</i>

17:10.594 --> 17:14.031
The sound you hear
is a male screech owl.

17:14.031 --> 17:17.134
By playing this, I'm hoping
to attract a female.

17:17.135 --> 17:19.936
So, things aren't
working out too well
with your girlfriend, huh?

17:21.806 --> 17:23.406
No, no, tim.

17:23.407 --> 17:26.710
On my last owl prowl,
I studied the male
of the species.

17:26.711 --> 17:28.779
This year, I hope to study
the female.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.847
Golly,
that sounds like a hoot.

17:30.848 --> 17:34.251
<i>(laughs)</i>

17:34.252 --> 17:37.487
So, what brings you out here
at this late hour?

17:37.488 --> 17:41.392
Jill found randy's pillow
in the microwave.
You know what she thinks?

17:41.393 --> 17:46.263
Oh, probably that
he's sleeping on the couch
instead of in the basement.

17:46.264 --> 17:47.664
You're amazing.

17:47.665 --> 17:50.467
Actually, I had
a little extra clue.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.973
Well, gosh darn it,
she's right.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.275
If he's so scared,
why wouldn't he tell me?

17:58.276 --> 18:01.945
Well, tim, when you were 13,
would you have admitted
your fears?

18:01.946 --> 18:03.881
When I was 13, I wasn't
scared of anything.

18:03.882 --> 18:07.184
If anybody tells you different,
they're a big fat liar.

18:07.185 --> 18:10.220
You know, tim, I'm reminded
of the great winston churchill.

18:10.221 --> 18:13.991
He said you could take
the most gallant sailor,
the most intrepid airman,

18:13.992 --> 18:15.993
The most audacious soldier,

18:15.994 --> 18:18.896
Put them at a table together,
what do you get?

18:18.897 --> 18:20.997
Throw in a cowboy
and a policeman,

18:20.998 --> 18:24.201
You got the village people
playin' poker.

18:24.202 --> 18:28.973
No, tim. What you get
is the sum of their fears.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.843
I don't understand.

18:32.844 --> 18:36.780
What I'm saying, tim,
if these men had been able
to admit their fears,

18:36.781 --> 18:40.618
They would've realized
there was no reason
to be ashamed of them.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.253
<i>(screeching)</i>

18:43.254 --> 18:45.155
Whoo-hoo.
That scared me.

18:45.156 --> 18:47.424
Oh, boy,
it scared me, too.

18:47.425 --> 18:49.459
And I'm not ashamed
to admit it...

18:49.460 --> 18:52.596
Although I do have to
change my pants.

19:08.046 --> 19:10.414
<i>(whispers)</i> hey, son.
Dad, hi.

19:10.415 --> 19:15.619
I, uh, just came up here
to get a glass of water,
and, whew, tired me out.

19:17.255 --> 19:19.290
I'm sorry I scared you.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.425
I wasn't scared.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.494
It's ok. You know
winston churchill?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.496
He's scared to death
of the village people.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.399
I didn't know that.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.672
When I was a kid, I got
scared a lot. Ooh, boy.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.740
Really? What were you
scared of?

19:36.741 --> 19:39.510
Mostly my grandma
and grandpa's house.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.012
The attic was cool,
arched roofs,

19:42.013 --> 19:45.115
And a tin ceiling
that made noise
in the rain. Big fans.

19:45.116 --> 19:48.919
Fun in the daytime,
but you couldn't force me
up there at night. Oh, boy!

19:48.920 --> 19:50.554
How come?

19:50.555 --> 19:52.823
It was
a real creepy place.

19:52.824 --> 19:57.428
Grandpa didn't help.
He told me there was a big
blood-sucking bat up there.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.563
And he wasn't
talking about grandma.

20:01.533 --> 20:05.368
So, you fell for grandpa's
blood-sucking bat story, huh?

20:05.369 --> 20:07.605
When he told me that,
I wasn't scared at all.

20:07.606 --> 20:10.106
But when he told it to me,
he didn't have his teeth in.

20:21.719 --> 20:24.388
So I guess you eventually
got over your fear of attics?

20:24.389 --> 20:29.693
Didn't have to. A tornado
took the top of the house
off... Bats and all.

20:29.694 --> 20:32.730
So I guess you're not afraid
of attics anymore.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.399
Nope. Terrified
of tornadoes, but...

20:36.400 --> 20:40.170
I was in such a hurry
to get you down into your room
in the basement,

20:40.171 --> 20:42.372
I forgot to give you
the checklist.

20:42.373 --> 20:44.407
What checklist?

20:44.408 --> 20:46.409
There's
an important checklist

20:46.410 --> 20:48.311
About weird stuff that happens
in the basement.

20:48.312 --> 20:51.548
Without that
information, it can be
a pretty creepy place.

20:51.549 --> 20:54.317
What do you say we go over
these items one by one?

20:54.318 --> 20:56.753
That'd be great. How about
we start with sounds?

20:56.754 --> 20:59.523
Good one. All right,
come on. Get your pillow.

20:59.524 --> 21:03.259
Now, this sound is very common.
<i>(imitates sound)</i>

21:03.260 --> 21:05.863
Gas furnace, number one.
Got it.

21:05.864 --> 21:10.734
Number two. Tink-tink
tonk-tonk-tonk-tonk...

21:10.735 --> 21:12.803
Air in the pipes.
Don't worry about that.

21:12.804 --> 21:15.539
Great.
This one - <i>(gulping)</i>

21:18.142 --> 21:20.176
What basement sound
is that?

21:20.177 --> 21:22.278
That wouldn't be the basement.
That would be coming from
my room.

21:22.279 --> 21:25.949
I was trying to digest
your mom's meat loaf.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.985
Don't worry about
this one, either -

21:27.986 --> 21:29.586
<i>(creaking)</i>

21:29.587 --> 21:31.688
That's just the big
blood-sucking bat

21:31.689 --> 21:34.157
Coming down to get you
in the basement.

21:47.638 --> 21:48.939
<i>(snoring)</i>

22:15.800 --> 22:17.301
<i>(loud thud)</i>

22:33.851 --> 22:37.720
All right. As you can see,
we've already framed our vent
opening for the heat and air.

22:37.721 --> 22:40.891
Now we're ready to attach
the duct to the trunk line.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.425
Trunk line?

22:42.426 --> 22:45.362
Al, would that be like
a bunch of elephants
doing the conga?

22:45.363 --> 22:48.432
Bah-bum-bum-bum-bum-bah!
Bah-bum-bum-bum-bum-bah!

22:48.433 --> 22:51.168
Bah-bum-bum-bum!
<i>(trumpets)</i>

22:51.169 --> 22:54.037
Look out, dumbo!
Watch out...

22:57.409 --> 22:59.710
I don't think so, tim.

22:59.711 --> 23:03.046
Bah-bum-bum-bum-bum!
Bah-bum-bum-bum-bum!
