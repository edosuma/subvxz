11:15.675 --> 11:17.894
FBI?

11:19.635 --> 11:21.115
Ah, CIA.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.772
Mm.Father Alonso thought

11:25.815 --> 11:27.991
you might be
able to help us.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.517
If you know Alonso,

11:32.561 --> 11:35.564
then you know that asking
questions about Arcanum Gladio

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
is bad for your health.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.134
What are you talking about?

11:40.177 --> 11:42.745
Alonso died this morning.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.704
What?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.662
Oh, my God.How?

11:46.706 --> 11:47.924
Car accident,

11:47.968 --> 11:49.621
if you believe the authorities.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.754
Arcanum Gladiokilled him.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.277
Someone did.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.976
They're trying to clean up
this whole mess

11:56.019 --> 11:57.673
because people have been
asking too many questions

11:57.717 --> 11:59.980
since the attack on
the Vatican; people like you.

12:00.023 --> 12:03.679
Now, I've kept my silence
all these years,

12:03.723 --> 12:07.117
and therefore my life.

12:07.161 --> 12:10.904
If you value yours...

12:10.947 --> 12:12.688
I'd advise you
to do the same.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.041
These men are dangerous,

12:18.085 --> 12:22.132
and they'll stop at nothing
to keep their secrets.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.746
Get out.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.228
I followed The Marshal's
directions.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.492
This is exactly where Sana
should be.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.802
This was Sana.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.848
It's been destroyed.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.503
Maybe the Banner with it.

12:45.547 --> 12:49.159
[all groan]

12:50.552 --> 12:52.423
Found the missionary hospital.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.077
LEXI:
All gone.

12:54.121 --> 12:57.472
I knew I should have taken us
back to Shangri-La.

12:57.515 --> 13:01.041
Now we're miles
from any help.I didn't know this place

13:01.084 --> 13:03.521
would be blown to bits.I'm not blaming you, Dad.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.827
I just need to think.LEXI: Danny...

13:04.871 --> 13:06.263
Danny!

13:06.307 --> 13:08.265
There's another village
a couple miles north

13:08.309 --> 13:09.701
from here on the map.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.442
It's a lot closer
than going back.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.444
You're assuming it has
medical treatment there.No.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.055
Daniel!Yes, Lexi, what?

13:15.098 --> 13:17.753
I need your help
to peel this orange.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.973
Lexi, don't move!

13:20.016 --> 13:21.409
Oh, stop. You're shouting.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.063
Where did you get that orange?

13:23.106 --> 13:24.586
The-the ground, silly.

13:24.629 --> 13:25.587
Right here on the ground.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.849
It's a bomb, isn't it?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.155
Bomb? Oh, what...Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.721
Where?Hey, hey, hey.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.811
Give it to me and I'm
gonna peel it for you.

13:31.854 --> 13:35.379
No. I don't need your help
to peel an orange.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.642
I am... whoa.

13:37.686 --> 13:41.516
The room's spinning.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.692
Don't drop it.
Don't throw it.I know. I know.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.867
For God's sakes,
don't shake it.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.695
Dad! I know.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.959
I've never seen a bomb
like this before.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.656
It's a cluster munition.
It's American-made.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.920
BLU-61.

13:53.963 --> 13:54.921
Wait, what?

13:54.964 --> 13:57.880
What? American?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.795
Wh-Why would we bomb
our own hospital?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.363
Danny, I'd love to discuss it
with you later,

14:02.406 --> 14:03.712
as soon as you
put the bomb down.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.888
It's probably still alive.
Now, sharp eyes.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.890
Those things are like
cockroaches; you see one,

14:07.934 --> 14:09.370
there's plenty you haven't seen.

14:09.413 --> 14:12.590
You sure seem to know a lot
about ordinance.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.331
I thought you just did
pickups and deliveries.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.246
We tried to help the Laotians
fight Communism

14:16.290 --> 14:17.900
by bombing the living hell
out of the country.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.338
This place is littered
with unexploded ordinance.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.775
Each BLU-61 had

14:23.819 --> 14:26.300
tens of dozens of nasty
little guys, just like that.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.131
Yep...

14:31.174 --> 14:32.480
that sounds about right.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.053
Good place for a break
up near that rubble

14:40.096 --> 14:43.447
if you need a rest. Bomb!I don't need a break.

14:43.491 --> 14:47.234
I know you.
Too proud to admit it.

14:47.277 --> 14:50.106
We've spent a combined
two days together

14:50.150 --> 14:53.327
in the last 20 years...
Bomb!

14:53.370 --> 14:55.851
Let's not pretend like
you know me all that well.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.026
A father knows his son.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.549
You're part me,
don't forget it.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.725
Believe me, I've tried.

15:00.769 --> 15:04.120
Ah, there it is. It's been
brewing up, I get it.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.382
Okay, you win.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.210
I need a break.
Let's go here.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.865
Right here.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.391
I hope you're happy.
You won the standoff.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.393
I didn't realize
it was a standoff.

15:16.437 --> 15:19.005
[Patrick coughing]

15:22.399 --> 15:24.010
You don't look so good.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.186
Oh, and the insults
just keep coming, don't they?

15:26.229 --> 15:28.057
Come on.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.277
Get it off your chest.What? Get what

15:30.320 --> 15:32.192
off my chest?

15:32.235 --> 15:34.324
What a terrible father I am.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.196
I wasn't perfect,

15:36.239 --> 15:38.372
but I'm trying to own
my mistakes.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.548
I'm trying
to make things right with you

15:40.591 --> 15:42.158
in what little time
that I got left.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.986
"Wasn't perfect."
You kidding me?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.640
I mean, you
weren't even good.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.948
Wait, wait.
Wait, what do you mean,

15:48.991 --> 15:51.994
with what little time
you got left?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.692
The clinical trials
have masked the symptoms, but...

15:54.736 --> 15:56.129
but that's all.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.653
I've been getting by
on adrenaline shots.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.569
Well, how long?

16:02.570 --> 16:04.485
Maybe a few weeks.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.626
MARTINA:
It's been a long time, Simon.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.628
HARDWICK:
It has.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.152
MARTINA:
Why me?

16:19.195 --> 16:21.502
HARDWICK:
Well, 'cause you're the best.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.678
At least, you were
till you went legit.

16:23.721 --> 16:27.160
Says the world-renowned
escaped terrorist.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.031
Who says I've escaped?

16:31.381 --> 16:34.819
Yeah. Can't believe everything
you read. [clears throat]

16:34.863 --> 16:37.648
You of all people should know
the power of disinformation.

16:37.692 --> 16:41.261
The fact is I did the world
an enormous favor

16:41.304 --> 16:43.872
when I exposed Jay Reece
for the kind of man he was.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.092
Not that I got any thanks.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.268
But while I was
conveniently being labeled

16:48.311 --> 16:50.879
public enemy number one,
a certain governmental agency

16:50.922 --> 16:52.620
took note of my, um...
[clicks tongue]

16:52.663 --> 16:55.536
Ah, what should we call it?
Skill set.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.494
Decided that those gifts
would be better employed

16:57.538 --> 17:01.063
outside prison and to far more
constructive and positive ends.

17:03.109 --> 17:06.329
The CIA sent you
to hire me to hack them?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.376
This sounds like a setup.

17:09.419 --> 17:12.031
Or you're lying.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.512
Well, the first time
you hacked the CIA,

17:15.556 --> 17:16.731
it took you three months.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.602
Well, they've just
been hacked again,

17:18.646 --> 17:20.517
only this time
it's taken 48 hours

17:20.561 --> 17:23.042
for the firewall
to be breached.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.091
Looks like someone's
bested your record.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.702
Seriously, if you're not up
to the challenge, I can...

17:31.746 --> 17:33.791
I can always take this
to Mishigawa.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.974
Look, it's a secret.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.151
They think they fixed it.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.197
Just needs to be tested
to be sure.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.244
And they've hired you
so they have

17:51.287 --> 17:53.985
plausible deniability
about the hack.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.249
Also,

17:56.292 --> 17:58.686
if anything goes wrong,

17:58.729 --> 18:01.254
they have a ready-made fall guy.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.911
You'll be paid handsomely
from an off-the-books account.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.131
Do feel free to dig
into the account history.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.829
You'll see a number of
transactions dating back years

18:11.873 --> 18:15.094
consistent with the movements
of large amounts of money

18:15.137 --> 18:17.444
from one CIA shell company
to another.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.491
This is a big project, Simon.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.667
I can't do this alone.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.409
I thought about that.
Do you remember

18:26.453 --> 18:29.325
when you got together with
a number of your associates,

18:29.369 --> 18:33.024
you designed a little race,
as I recall?Yeah.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.026
I could do that,

18:35.070 --> 18:37.028
but it wouldn't be cheap.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.509
Money's not an issue.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.513
So, are you officially
a white hat now,

18:43.557 --> 18:45.689
or is this a onetime thing?

18:45.733 --> 18:47.604
All I can say is
it doesn't feel half bad

18:47.648 --> 18:49.476

for the right time to tell you.

This is the right time?

In the middle of a field full
of unexploded munitions in Laos?

19:01.401 --> 19:03.142
Okay, so it's not ideal.

It's just a few AKs.

we should be okay.

Great. Well, how did
you get out of it

the last time?Decoy. Made a diversion.

Hey, I'll be right back.No, like hell you will.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.278
You're not running off
on me again.

They're not gonna
cross into the bomb field.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.066
Well,
if we wait here long enough,

19:58.109 --> 19:59.546
they'll hit one of the bombs,
and they won't have to.

think that goes?

stuff ain't for me, Father.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.799
I'm a priest, not a spy.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.976
I wanted to apologize
for before.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.677
And confess.

22:14.245 --> 22:16.291
When I became a
priest, I took a vow

22:16.335 --> 22:20.687
of poverty, chastity
and obedience,

22:20.730 --> 22:24.299
and lately I've been
questioning one of those vows.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.475
Especially after
what happened

22:26.519 --> 22:28.129
to Father Alonso.

22:30.087 --> 22:34.135
One question keeps
coming to me.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.355
Who do I obey?

22:36.398 --> 22:40.359
Is it God or is it the Church?

22:41.447 --> 22:44.406
It need not be a choice.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.234
But if lives are at stake,

22:46.277 --> 22:49.324
and I don't seek the truth
that could help save them...

22:50.934 --> 22:53.372
...is that not evil?

22:53.415 --> 22:57.724
Well, we all struggle
with such questions.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.510
Father.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.166
What happened in Laos

23:05.209 --> 23:09.083
that turned Sister Victoria
into a saint?

23:12.216 --> 23:15.263
A terrorist is on the loose

23:15.306 --> 23:19.746
who has killed
many, many people,

23:19.789 --> 23:22.357
including our brothers
and sisters.

23:22.401 --> 23:26.753
I need to know what that has to
do with what happened in Laos,

23:26.796 --> 23:29.320
and if asking questions
gets me killed,

23:29.364 --> 23:31.497
so be it.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.715
I didn't
become a priest

23:32.759 --> 23:34.325
for the health plan.

23:35.239 --> 23:37.024
Did you, Father?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.941
Or did you do it
to help people?

23:42.508 --> 23:44.814
Because now is your chance.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.729
[sighs]

23:48.296 --> 23:51.560
I've been going through
the motions for so many years...

23:53.519 --> 23:56.435
...I can barely remember
why I took my vows.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.527
Bishop Donnelly...

24:03.529 --> 24:06.096
...the Lord absolves you
of your sins,

24:06.140 --> 24:08.185
and for your penance

24:08.229 --> 24:10.666
I'd like you
to hear my confession.

24:14.104 --> 24:17.107
What you got over there?

24:17.151 --> 24:19.980
I want to say...

24:20.023 --> 24:21.242
...SpaghettiOs.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.722
Mmm.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.811
And some crackers.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.597
How old do you
think those are?

24:28.641 --> 24:32.209
[sighs] Probably best
if you don't know.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.779
Here.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.871
You know what?

24:41.915 --> 24:43.873
I've had worse.

24:43.917 --> 24:47.007
Yeah. Me, too.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.227
Ah.

24:50.271 --> 24:53.056
Look what we got here.
[sniffles]

24:53.100 --> 24:54.580
Oh, yeah, you sure
that's a good idea?

24:54.623 --> 24:56.756
I'm already riddled
with the cancer.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.498
A little snake wine's
not gonna hurt me now.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.504
[grunts softly, exhales]

25:07.723 --> 25:09.029
Come on.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.248
Eh, what the hell?

25:15.165 --> 25:16.427
[coughs]

25:16.471 --> 25:18.212
[laughs]

25:18.255 --> 25:20.910
Oh, yeah.
[inhales sharply]

25:20.954 --> 25:22.042
[coughs]

25:22.085 --> 25:23.434
[exhales]
Look at that.

25:23.478 --> 25:24.958
What?

25:25.001 --> 25:27.177
[coughs, sniffles]

25:27.221 --> 25:29.876
It's after midnight,
December 25th.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.705
It's Christmas?

25:32.748 --> 25:34.184
Guess it is.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.838
Huh.

25:35.882 --> 25:39.233
It's our first Christmas
we've ever spent together.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.802
And apparently the last.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.760
Dad, I wished
you'd told me sooner.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.460
You know, for what it's worth,
she wanted me to tell you.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.679
Lexi knew?

25:50.723 --> 25:52.072
Yeah. She was
smart enough

25:52.115 --> 25:55.162
to know you needed
to hear it from me first.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.599
You got a good one there.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.124
Yeah. I know.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.299
Then what are you waiting for?

26:03.126 --> 26:05.128
[shushes]She's out like a light.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.915
What would the Romans say?
Carpe...

26:08.958 --> 26:10.133
[laughs]:
Lexi?

26:10.177 --> 26:12.092
See, I can speak

26:12.135 --> 26:14.137
some of your antiquity lingo.Y-You know,
I-I don't know

26:14.181 --> 26:16.357
if I can have this conversation
with you.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.751
Oh. Not now? Or never?

26:18.794 --> 26:20.187
I don't know.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.971
Jury's out.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.712
Well, you're running out of time
to get my nuggets of wisdom.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.932
Dad, I...

26:25.975 --> 26:27.847
Nuggets of wisdom? What?

26:28.978 --> 26:30.806
What's that?

26:30.850 --> 26:33.113
I spent 20 years in prison
thinking about my life.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.941
You don't think I could
squeeze out a couple nuggets?

26:34.984 --> 26:38.727
Okay, I'm done eating now.
[clears throat]

26:38.771 --> 26:43.732
Look, I just... my last
year has been pretty crazy.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.169
I can't think about big
picture stuff right now.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.563
That's what you think
it's about? A year?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.217
What is that supposed to mean?

26:50.260 --> 26:52.393
Danny, problems go
a lot deeper than a year.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.569
Trust me, I know.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.180
I was there.

26:57.224 --> 27:00.270
You saw your mother and I
at our absolute worst.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.489
Especially me.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.970
It's got to have
an effect.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.628
You're so afraid of marriage,
your best friend's a priest,

27:09.671 --> 27:12.456
and they're literally not even
allowed to get married, right?

27:14.894 --> 27:18.158
You know, my mistake
wasn't getting married.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.899
My mistake was pushing away

27:19.942 --> 27:21.814
the best thing
that ever happened to me.

27:25.121 --> 27:28.211
The fact that you and Lexi
are still together, that's a...

27:28.255 --> 27:30.083
it's a minor miracle.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.521
Miracle?

27:35.175 --> 27:37.786
You ever wonder why
you like old stuff so much?

27:39.570 --> 27:41.921
It's 'cause you can
count on it.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.575
Because it's always
gonna be there.

27:44.619 --> 27:47.143
Danny, you don't trust anything
if it hasn't been around

27:47.187 --> 27:49.232
for at least a hundred years.

27:52.322 --> 27:53.497
See that?

27:53.541 --> 27:54.847
It's raining nuggets.

27:56.762 --> 28:00.156
You know, I used to think
that you hated me

28:00.200 --> 28:01.767
because I was a criminal.

28:01.810 --> 28:05.292
I didn't find out
until earlier today

28:05.335 --> 28:10.079
that you hated me
because I left you alone.

28:17.783 --> 28:21.830
I don't, I don't hate you...
Dad.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.055
Well, that's a start.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.970
[clears throat]

28:33.799 --> 28:37.585
GIANCANA:
We thought the Soviets were
going to destroy the world.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.935
What could be more holy
than saving

28:39.979 --> 28:42.721
all of the Lord's creation?

28:42.764 --> 28:47.508
The entire region that had once
been conquered by Genghis Khan

28:47.551 --> 28:52.252
was largely Communist...
and atheist.

28:52.295 --> 28:56.952
So the Vatican and the CIA
had a common enemy.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.388
GIANCANA:
Not officially.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.347
But elements
within each organization

29:00.390 --> 29:05.613
who, who believed in the cause
formed Arcanum Gladioin secret.

29:07.571 --> 29:08.921
[laughs softly]

29:08.964 --> 29:10.574
They thought they could
end the Cold War

29:10.618 --> 29:13.621
with one swing of the sword.

29:13.664 --> 29:16.624
By wiping out the entire
Communist world

29:16.667 --> 29:19.845
with a genetically engineered
plague?

29:19.888 --> 29:23.239
This was the Nuclear Age.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.547
Always on the precipice
of Armageddon.

29:30.856 --> 29:34.207
My job was to help mask
the operation

29:34.250 --> 29:36.818
by doing missionary work in...

29:36.862 --> 29:39.908
in hospitals throughout Laos.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.825
But...

29:46.523 --> 29:49.091
...we needed human subjects.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.530
What happened when
Sister Victoria stopped you?

29:53.574 --> 29:56.838
The Vatican found out
what we were working on,

29:56.882 --> 29:59.101
how far things had gone.

30:01.060 --> 30:04.454
They stopped it immediately.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.674
And the CIA covered it up.

30:06.717 --> 30:09.155
And Sister Victoria
became Saint Victoria,

30:09.198 --> 30:11.461
but the world
could never know why.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.859
I failed God's test

30:17.903 --> 30:19.948
by keeping it secret...

30:26.215 --> 30:29.088
...and therefore made
redemption impossible.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.841
[crying]

30:43.885 --> 30:46.322
Ego te absolvo.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.641
Hmm, Dad?

31:00.684 --> 31:02.773
[gasps]

31:02.817 --> 31:04.384
Hi.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.952
Bad dream?
Hey.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.388
You're alive.

31:08.431 --> 31:11.217
Apparently. Thanks to them.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.135
Always fixing me up.

31:16.178 --> 31:20.095
Kind of becoming
our routine, huh?

31:20.139 --> 31:21.749
[sighs]

31:21.792 --> 31:25.231
Everything's a bit of a blur
since the accident.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.365
Did I say anything embarrassing?

31:29.409 --> 31:31.324
No more than usual.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.980
At death's door
and you see how he treats me?

31:35.981 --> 31:38.157
This man...

31:38.200 --> 31:40.507
Your father found us.

31:40.550 --> 31:43.031
He's up in the temple. Go.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.598
We can take care of her.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.731
[quietly]:
Okay.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.039
Go to him.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.358
Hey.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.927
Hey.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.801
I got a little restless at dawn.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.282
Had a feeling to come this way.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.808
You ever seen anything
like this before?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.725
No.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.814
I haven't.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.647
Thank you for coming
with me to Laos.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.217
Thanks for bringing me.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.960
[laughs quietly]

32:42.003 --> 32:43.657
[footsteps approaching]

32:43.700 --> 32:44.832
Hey.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.921
Ah, turns out,
after the bombing,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.749
all the villagers
came through here.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.448
Our, uh, new friends say
the person we need to talk to

32:52.492 --> 32:54.320
is Sister Victoria.

32:54.363 --> 32:57.584
She rescued all of us from Sana.

32:57.627 --> 33:00.021
We've been on the trail of
an ancient Spirit Banner

33:00.065 --> 33:02.284
called the Soul
of Genghis Khan.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.373
We believe it came to Sana.

33:04.417 --> 33:05.853
Yes.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.768
Sister Victoria
gave it to me.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.292
She thought it
was Buddhist

33:10.336 --> 33:11.815
and belonged with us.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.035
I sent the Banner
north with a monk

33:14.079 --> 33:16.472
to return it to Mongolia.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.126
Do you remember his name?

33:18.170 --> 33:19.301
Gen Huang.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.563
He said he would travel

33:20.607 --> 33:22.696
through China to
return the Banner

33:22.739 --> 33:24.350
back to its rightful place.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.439
[indistinct chatter]

33:28.832 --> 33:31.183
DANNY:
What else can you tell us
about this Gen Huang?

33:31.226 --> 33:32.749
MONK:
He was a simple man...

33:35.143 --> 33:37.015
RASA:
Block the entrance.
We're on our way.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.364
[indistinct chatter]

33:38.407 --> 33:39.408
What is it?

33:51.942 --> 33:53.988
[guns cocking]Okay, we need a plan.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.076
Or guns.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.208
Preferably both.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.818
No guns in the temple.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.429
Those men will
honor it, too.

34:02.866 --> 34:03.954
[wind whooshing]

34:03.998 --> 34:05.086
DANNY:
The candles...

34:06.479 --> 34:07.784
Can everyone run?

34:07.828 --> 34:09.003
Not like I used to.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.091
I may vomit.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.092
Great. Follow me.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.093
[groans]

34:12.137 --> 34:14.052
[men shouting]

34:24.627 --> 34:26.020
It's a dead end.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.022
We're trapped.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.939
There's a current.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.028
It's fresh water,
from outside.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.943
We can swim out.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.084
[muffled gunfire]

34:52.046 --> 34:53.569
[men shouting]

34:57.007 --> 34:58.835
Ugh. Bugger.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.230
Let's move.

35:06.016 --> 35:08.193
[gunfire]

35:09.672 --> 35:10.804
Danny, more bombs!

35:10.847 --> 35:11.892
DANNY:
I know!

35:11.935 --> 35:13.459
Bombs?!Keep running!

35:14.808 --> 35:17.071
Oh, right! The orange!

35:18.246 --> 35:19.291
DANNY:
Lexi, that's a...

35:19.334 --> 35:21.031
I know! Take cover.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.867
[flare gun fires]

35:34.001 --> 35:36.177
[men shouting]

35:44.794 --> 35:47.623
[coughs]

35:47.667 --> 35:48.842
[grunts]

35:48.885 --> 35:50.974
[exhales sharply]

35:51.018 --> 35:53.412
Oh, don't pretend like
that was your plan all along.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.509
[footsteps approaching]

36:16.565 --> 36:18.828
Where'd you find
pizza at 3:00 a.m.?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.832
Giancana hooked it up.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.837
After baring our souls,
we got snacky.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.363
You okay?

36:31.406 --> 36:34.017
We work for bad people, Kate.

36:35.802 --> 36:38.239
Some of them were, Chuck.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.113
But others are trying
to make it right.

36:43.157 --> 36:44.941
And we can help them.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.987
How?

36:47.030 --> 36:49.598
Trust.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.645
Responsibility.

36:52.688 --> 36:55.561
Taking the weight
for your choices and feelings,

36:55.604 --> 36:58.999
and spending the rest
of your life living up to them.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.610
[laughs softly]

37:01.654 --> 37:03.264
Did you just quote
Meet Joe Black?

37:03.308 --> 37:06.093
I've still never
seen that movie.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.400
I'm just saying
the CIA can use

37:08.443 --> 37:11.925
this information to see
how the Khan compromised them.

37:13.492 --> 37:14.884
I have a jet waiting for me.

37:14.928 --> 37:17.365
I-I have to go look into it.

37:17.409 --> 37:19.149
For now, you stay here.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.023
No.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.025
Someone at the Vatican
is cleaning up

37:25.068 --> 37:27.245
everything related
to Arcanum Gladio,

37:27.288 --> 37:30.160
and now that includes
Danny and Lexi.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.423
And you.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.340
I'm going back to Rome
to find out who.Chuck...

37:35.383 --> 37:37.298
If someone got hurt
because I waited...

37:41.128 --> 37:42.869
I underestimated you.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.005
Be careful.

37:52.574 --> 37:53.836
You, too.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.799
Congratulations.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.540
Your meeting delivered
even better results

38:01.583 --> 38:03.106
than we were hoping for.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.543
Well, that's good,
'cause...

38:04.586 --> 38:07.023
So Martina hacked
the CIA already, did she?

38:07.067 --> 38:09.243
No. But thanks to
the transmitter

38:09.287 --> 38:10.853
that I had sewn in the
lining of your suit,

38:10.897 --> 38:12.725
we were able to
read all the data

38:12.768 --> 38:15.597
from the computers that she
tried so hard to keep shielded.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.599
So when she put
out a bounty

38:17.643 --> 38:19.862
on the assignment
that you suggested,

38:19.906 --> 38:22.604
her friends flocked to it
like bees to honey.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.650
They were
easy to find.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.704
What's happening?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.532
BATU:
Thanks to you,
we're eliminating

38:37.576 --> 38:41.884
all the top white hat hackers
all over the world.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.974
Now there's no one who can get
in the way of our final plans.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.282
Well done.

38:56.638 --> 38:58.814
Hey, The Marshal sent word.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.251
"Thanks to all of you,
Shangri-La might actually

39:01.295 --> 39:02.514
"get some
peace and quiet.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.602
Hell, the whole
Golden Triangle might."

39:03.645 --> 39:05.343
[Lexi chuckles]"Thanks."

39:05.386 --> 39:07.954
Nice work, Smoke.
Yeah.

39:07.997 --> 39:10.870
Well, I'll go load up.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.091
Hey.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.485
You're staying here, Dad.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.531
In Shangri-La.

39:19.574 --> 39:20.836
No way.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.884
You were happy here.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.843
After everything
you've been through...

39:27.887 --> 39:31.717
everything we've been through...
you deserve this.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.067
What about the FBI, right?
What about Harper?

39:34.110 --> 39:35.938
You made a promise.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.158
I'm not leaving you
to clean up my mess ever again.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.507
[sighs]
Don't worry.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.422
I'll tell Harper
you didn't make it out.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.773
He'll be thrilled not to have
to deal with you anymore.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.908
Ready to go?

39:52.868 --> 39:54.522
I'm gonna catch up with you.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.482
Oh.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.094
Stay out of trouble?

40:02.095 --> 40:03.531
No promises.

40:10.016 --> 40:11.800
[sighs]

40:19.504 --> 40:21.593
This was fun.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.246
Yeah.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.249
Danny, uh...

40:28.991 --> 40:30.166
Uh...

40:30.210 --> 40:32.821
I got somethingfor you.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.434
Merry Christmas.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.799
I just thought this way
I could always be with you.

40:57.106 --> 40:58.499
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.327
Careful with
that clasp.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.763
It's kind of old, so...

41:01.807 --> 41:03.461
Yeah.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.294
I love you, son.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.826
I love you, too, Dad.
