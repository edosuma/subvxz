Ooh-wa-ooh-wa!
Thank you, Gurgs.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.957
-You're welcome.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.208
Now, I know he's gorgeous,

20:50.250 --> 20:53.211
but you touch him,
I'll kill you.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.380

20:59.300 --> 21:00.677

21:00.719 --> 21:03.888
-It's hard to be in a bad mood
around X-rated desserts.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.265
Thank God
it's no one's birthday.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.642
I wouldn't know where
to put the candle.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.478
-I guess for every top chef,
there's a bottom chef.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.272
-I don't know why everyone's
being so polite

21:12.313 --> 21:15.358
to this filthy box.
Can't we just jump in?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.651
-Get in there, Gurgs.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.445
-Aw, my nickname is back.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.655
-Thank you all for hanging
with me this week.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.950
It's nice to know you're there
to support me when I need it.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.411
-To Abby.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.290
-To Abby.
