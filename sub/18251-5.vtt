WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.771
Hey, wow!

00:03.804 --> 00:05.039
Look at you, Mr. Fancy Pants!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.074
It's almost like
you're a new person.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.541
No Bruce, it's me.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.043
I'm Gustaf.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.744
Yeah, I can see that.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.346
Wow, look at you!

00:12.380 --> 00:13.814
You look like
a new person.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.283
God, what's
wrong with you?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.450
It's me, I'm Gustaf!

00:16.484 --> 00:17.485
Can't you see that?

00:17.518 --> 00:18.586
I can see that.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.787
I'm going to the
American Club.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.789
I just want to make
a good first impression.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.024
And why are you going
to the American Club?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.426
You know you're
not American, right?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.994
The American Club is
not just for Americans.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.129
It's also for Swedes

00:28.162 --> 00:30.431
who have some
connection to America.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.599
And your connection is?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.201
Bruce!
Oh!

00:33.234 --> 00:35.503
Plus, I don't think
he had anyone else
to go with.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.770
What?

00:36.804 --> 00:37.871
I have plenty
of friends.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.473
That's not what Emma said.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.908
What?
What?

00:40.941 --> 00:42.143
Bruce:
You said I don't
have any friends?

00:42.176 --> 00:43.411
(Laughing nervously)
No!

00:43.444 --> 00:44.512
Gustaf:
Yeah, you did.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.847
I'm pretty sure
your exact words were,

00:46.880 --> 00:48.616
"Bruce has no friends".

00:48.649 --> 00:51.485
(Speaking Swedish)

00:51.519 --> 00:53.854
I didn't say you don't
have any friends.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.624
I said you don't
have many friends.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.360
In Sweden.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.794
Currently.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.363
Now.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.166
* We're not living in America

01:05.199 --> 01:08.536
* But we're not sorry

01:08.569 --> 01:10.304
* I knew there was something

01:10.338 --> 01:12.406
* That we never had

01:12.440 --> 01:15.776
* We don't worry, no

01:15.809 --> 01:18.679
* We're not living
in America *

01:18.712 --> 01:22.616
* But we're not sorry, no

01:22.650 --> 01:25.986
* We don't care
about the world today *

01:26.019 --> 01:28.856
* We're not sorry

01:28.889 --> 01:30.624
* For you

01:32.025 --> 01:36.130
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

01:36.164 --> 01:37.498
* Ahh

01:38.766 --> 01:40.568
It's not my fault, you know?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.671
I mean, Swedes are just
really hard to get to know.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.773
Back home, I was
super popular.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.874
I've heard.

01:46.907 --> 01:47.975
I mean, people would
call me all the time,

01:48.008 --> 01:49.143
sometimes for no reason.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.411
You know,
we don't do that here,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.045
we don't call people
for no reason.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.547
Yeah, maybe I'm going
about it the wrong way.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.617
No, this is not you.
This is... this is
a culture thing.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.718
I mean, Swedes are...

01:57.751 --> 01:58.952
Boring.
No.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.588
Horrible.
No! I was going to say,

02:00.621 --> 02:02.856
it takes time.
Oh.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.792
So, go away to
your American friends

02:04.825 --> 02:07.561
and you can make fun of us
horrible, boring Swedes.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.230
I will. Thank you.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.398
(Kissing)

02:10.431 --> 02:11.499
I love you.
Have fun.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.666
Okay.
Bye.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.936
Wait... I'm sorry but...
I'm just checking.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.306
You're not mad at me
for some reason, are you?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.473
Mad? No!

02:19.507 --> 02:20.641
Should I be?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.776
I don't... No, I was
just checking.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.977
Okay.
Okay.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.213
I love you!

02:25.246 --> 02:26.880
Bye!

02:26.914 --> 02:28.716
Why aren't you saying
"I love you" back?

02:28.749 --> 02:29.883
I didn't?
No. Twice.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.419
It's just because...
It's...

02:32.953 --> 02:34.422
Do we have to say it
all the time?

02:34.455 --> 02:35.589
Not if you don't want to.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.790
I do want to,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.859
but maybe we should
just save the words

02:38.892 --> 02:40.093
for special occasions,

02:40.127 --> 02:41.695
when they really
mean something?

02:41.729 --> 02:42.996
They do really mean something!

02:43.030 --> 02:44.632
"I love you" means "I love you"!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.800
I know that,
and I feel the same way.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.036
But, do we have
to say it all the time?

02:49.069 --> 02:51.739
It feels like the words
become meaningless.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.607
Gustaf:
Bruce! Got to go!

02:53.641 --> 02:56.777
I wouldn't... Okay, um.
Whatever, super weird.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.978
Goodbye, Emma.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.179
Goodbye, Bruce.

03:00.548 --> 03:07.988
(Music)

03:08.021 --> 03:09.290
Whoa, whoa.
Hold up, man,

03:09.323 --> 03:10.658
you've still got
the price tag on you.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.793
God, no, no, Bruce!
What are you doing?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.027
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

03:14.061 --> 03:15.663
to return clothes
without the tags on?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.598
You're going to wear the
clothes then return them?

03:17.631 --> 03:19.132
I finally
figured it out.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.602
How to live
totally for free.
Oh, boy.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.871
I buy clothes,
wear them, return them,

03:23.904 --> 03:26.574
and boom, get money
for new clothes.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.076
It's the best idea
I've ever had, Bruce.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.278
Yeah, it's a good one.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.280
(Ambient music)
Bruce:
All right!

03:32.313 --> 03:33.747
This is more like it.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.983
Hey, guys! Welcome to the
American Club of Stockholm.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.184
Can I take
your jackets?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.752
Thanks, yeah!
Yeah.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.053
I like this place already.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.590
Check it out.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.824
Isn't that Bengt?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.293
Bruce:
Hey, Bengt!
Gustaf:
Bengt!

03:46.627 --> 03:48.296
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.698
I'm sorry, you must
have mixed me up
with someone else.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.965
Bengt, it's us!

03:51.999 --> 03:53.634
Gustaf and Bruce!

03:53.667 --> 03:55.769
Uh... Follow me,

03:55.803 --> 03:57.838
strange people who
I have never seen before.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.106
Let's talk.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.346
(Rapid footsteps)

04:05.379 --> 04:07.281
Whoa, that was close.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.882
But I think
I got away with it.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.183
What are you guys
doing here?

04:10.217 --> 04:11.585
What am I doing here?
I'm an American.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.886
What are you doing here?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.988
There are some things
you need to know.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.592
My name here
is Samuel Jackson.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.861
And I work for NASA.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.030
Questions?

04:23.063 --> 04:23.964
So many.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.968
* In his anger and his shame

04:28.001 --> 04:31.171
* I am leaving, I am leaving

04:31.204 --> 04:33.541
* But the fighter
still remains *

04:33.574 --> 04:35.443
* He still remains

04:35.476 --> 04:39.413
(Acoustic guitar music)

04:39.447 --> 04:42.316
* Lie-la-lie

04:42.350 --> 04:43.951
Both:
* Lie, la-lie-lie

04:43.984 --> 04:45.453
* Lie, la-lie

04:45.486 --> 04:48.356
* Lie, la-lie...
Thank you.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.291
* La, la-la-la, lie, la-lie

04:51.325 --> 04:54.194
* La-la-la, lie

04:54.227 --> 04:57.164
* La, la-la-la, lie, la-lie

04:57.197 --> 05:00.100
* Lie, la-lie

05:00.133 --> 05:03.537
* La, la-la-la, lie, la-lie

05:03.571 --> 05:07.775
* La-la-la, lie

05:07.808 --> 05:09.777
(Applause)

05:15.983 --> 05:17.217
That was really good, man!

05:17.250 --> 05:18.318
Oh, thank you.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.620
Yeah, there was
a couple of times there

05:19.653 --> 05:21.589
when you sounded exactly
like the real guy.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.656
(Chuckling)

05:22.690 --> 05:23.824
You almost had
me fooled!

05:23.857 --> 05:25.459
Heh... yeah.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.795
A lot of people say that.
Yeah.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.297
Do you make a
living off of this?
Is this your job?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.133
I... I can make
a living from it, yeah.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.668
You're kidding!
Yeah, I play...

05:34.702 --> 05:36.770
Sometimes I play
at little bit
bigger places.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.038
Bigger than this?

05:38.071 --> 05:40.040
Yeah, I'm in between shows

05:40.073 --> 05:41.975
so I just thought I'd...
while I'm in town,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.011
I'd do a little...
little gig,

05:44.044 --> 05:46.146
work on some songs,
things like that.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.481
Right.
What do you do?

05:47.515 --> 05:49.282
I am "The Guy"...

05:49.316 --> 05:51.985
It's hard to explain
but celebrities pay me

05:52.019 --> 05:54.722
to show them around
and take them places

05:54.755 --> 05:56.023
and set them up
with, like, hotels

05:56.056 --> 05:57.190
and restaurants
and things like that.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.292
Oh, I knew a guy
like that in Rome.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.961
He was "The Guy" in Rome.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.831
Exactly! Yes!
That's the same concept,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.799
I'm the same...
I'm "The Stockholm Guy".

06:05.833 --> 06:07.167
Ahh, I see.
That version. Yeah.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.970
Well, let's say
I wanted to see

06:10.003 --> 06:11.939
the most important
sights in Stockholm.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.140
Where would you take me?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.942
Oh, I'm sorry, I wouldn't.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.411
I generally only take
celebrities around,

06:17.445 --> 06:19.747
or people with
a lot of money...

06:19.780 --> 06:22.716
Oh, well you know, tonight
was a pretty good night...

06:22.750 --> 06:24.952
No, that's so sweet but no,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.054
I wouldn't dream
of taking your money.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.522
Use that for
the bus or whatever.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.290
Well. I'm going to
take a cab, but...

06:30.323 --> 06:32.860
Cabs are expensive.
Watch out.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.195
So, um, is there
another Guy?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.664
Oh, there's a lot
of other...

06:36.697 --> 06:38.899
other lonely guys here

06:38.932 --> 06:40.167
if you're looking for...

06:40.200 --> 06:41.301
Yeah, but I got to...

06:41.334 --> 06:42.335
I got to get going.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.771
Okay. Well, Guy...

06:43.804 --> 06:45.405
Good luck.
Thank you so much.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.274
And keep doing it.
Don't ever give up
your dream, man,

06:47.307 --> 06:48.776
because you've
got something, okay?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.243
Doesn't matter how...
It's never too late.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.278
So keep it up!

06:51.311 --> 06:52.713
Oh, yeah... thank you.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.214
Thanks.
(Coins jingling)

06:55.849 --> 06:57.017
Hey, man.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.318
Hey.
Are you new here?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.587
Yeah, actually.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.021
I'm Chuck, by the way.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.123
Oh, hey. Bruce.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.093
Wait, whoa.
Um, what was that?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.327
It's just a handshake.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.729
So you met a black guy
and you were thinking,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.063
"Oh, let's do the
three-part handshake"?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.865
No.
No?
No, no, God, no.
You sure?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.366
Not like you want
to jump in the car

07:13.400 --> 07:14.802
and have a drive-by
and maybe start
a crack house?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.436
What?
No?
No. That's a...

07:16.470 --> 07:19.206
I would never...
Okay.
That's not my...
Yeah.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.274
I'm so sorry, I didn't...
Yeah, I'll...

07:21.308 --> 07:24.011
(Laughing)

07:24.044 --> 07:26.079
I'm just messing
with you, man.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.815
I'm just messing
with you.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.217
So what brings you
to this cold part
of the world, bro?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.418
Ah, it's a long
story, actually...

07:31.451 --> 07:32.586
Wait. Let me guess.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.454
Met a girl, fell in love,

07:34.488 --> 07:36.557
and now you're driving
through the slush

07:36.590 --> 07:37.891
in a Volvo?
No.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.092
No?
You missed it.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.730
I don't have a Volvo.
(Laughing)

07:42.763 --> 07:44.565
You're funny, man.
Yeah, you too.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.567
To new friends.
My brother.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.536
No.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.

07:48.569 --> 07:54.875
(Music)

07:54.908 --> 07:55.909
(Chuckle)
Yeah, my girlfriend and I

07:55.943 --> 07:57.177
are actually going
to get married soon.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.046
No! Really?
Yeah.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.414
I asked my girlfriend,
she was like, "Uh, why?"

08:01.448 --> 08:02.816
I know. Sometimes
it just takes time

08:02.850 --> 08:04.084
for them to get
used to the idea.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.485
Hmm.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.920
I'm sorry, this
has been bugging
me, you know.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.856
Have you ever seen
the movie "48 Hours"?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.924
Oh, dude, really?
Stop. Please.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.593
Really, seriously?
What?

08:12.626 --> 08:13.861
You're going to do
the whole, like,

08:13.894 --> 08:15.128
"Oh, you look
like Eddie Murphy.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.229
Can you do the laugh?"

08:16.263 --> 08:17.264
(Imitates Eddie Murphy)

08:17.297 --> 08:18.732
No.
No?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.100
I was going to say...

08:20.133 --> 08:22.135
Nick Nolte.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.672
Because...?
Because, um...

08:24.705 --> 08:27.407
You and Nick Nolte
have the same...

08:27.440 --> 08:28.408
energy.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.378
(Laughing)

08:31.411 --> 08:32.479
(Sighing)
Oh my God.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.748
Again!
(Laughing)

08:34.782 --> 08:36.383
Seriously though,
I really have to go.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.685
I have to go work tomorrow.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.252
Well you know, it's been
great to hang out, man,

08:39.286 --> 08:40.754
it's great to finally find
someone that I can talk to.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.623
You know what?
It's a bit old school,

08:42.656 --> 08:44.024
but here's my
business card.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.759
Oh, cool.
Boom.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.895
You call me any time.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.363
Okay. You call me Bruce.

08:50.397 --> 08:54.401
(Laughing)

08:54.434 --> 08:55.703
All right, man.
Take care.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.837
All right, I'll see you.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.105
Hey, I love y'all!

08:58.138 --> 09:00.107
Various:
Love you, Chuck!

09:05.145 --> 09:06.213
Hey.
Hey.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.217
Oh. Oh. God, uh-oh.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.418
You've got
a stain, Gustaf.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.820
How are you going to
return those clothes now?

09:12.853 --> 09:14.287
No problemo.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.256
I just need to borrow
5,000 crowns.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.891
5,000 crowns. For what?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.226
You can't return a shirt

09:19.259 --> 09:20.628
unless they think
you have money.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.062
And they don't think
you have money

09:22.095 --> 09:23.196
if you don't wear
a nice suit.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.598
Simple plan, Bruce.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.999
That is simple.
Yeah.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.500
You know, I would
give you the money

09:27.534 --> 09:28.969
just to see you
in a nice suit.
(Chuckling)
Yeah.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.204
But I don't have
it right now.
You know, this...

09:31.238 --> 09:32.873
"The Guy" thing isn't
really working out for me.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.507
You should talk
to Paul Simon about that.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.409
Yeah. If I ever magically
run in to Paul Simon,

09:36.443 --> 09:37.510
I'll ask him.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.847
Last night was great.
Hm?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.249
Yeah, me and this
Chuck guy, we had
so much in common.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.717
Good for you.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.653
Oh, he's a personal trainer.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.955
That's great, huh?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.556
What's that
supposed to mean?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.490
Nothing.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.061
What? I'm in shape.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.663
You're in a shape.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.330
A circle is a shape.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.267
(Laughing)

10:00.300 --> 10:01.869
I've got to go.
(Kissing)

10:01.902 --> 10:02.903
Bye.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.938
Yep. See you later.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.375
Wait.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.678
The reason for your not
saying "I love you" now

10:10.711 --> 10:12.946
is the conversation
we had yesterday, right?

10:12.980 --> 10:14.581
I mean, it's not
the shape joke?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.750
Hm, no. God, no.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.618
Shape joke was great.
Thank you.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.487
Also, I realized
last night

10:20.520 --> 10:22.389
that I think Americans
say "I love you"
a little too much.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.057
So I'm going to
try to cut back.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.359
Mmm. You're sweet.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.829
Got to go. Okay, bye.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.965
Goodbye, Emma.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.366
I'll clean up here...

10:34.501 --> 10:36.569
I guess...

10:36.603 --> 10:37.971
(Clearing throat, muttering)
I love you.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.511
Okay.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.367
Chuck!
He-e-ey!

11:40.400 --> 11:41.869
Hey man, great
to see you again.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.303
Bruce, what's up man?
What's up, baby?

11:43.336 --> 11:44.637
Mm-mmm!
Whoa...

11:44.671 --> 11:46.373
Hey, are you good?
I'm good, yeah.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.941
I'm psyched about
this. Are we going
to grab some lunch?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.376
We totally are.
But you know what?

11:49.409 --> 11:52.412
I just had
this great idea.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.714
You know an awesome way
to get to know each other?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.284
Push up for your life!

11:57.317 --> 11:59.652
Rah! Rah!

11:59.686 --> 12:01.654
(Laughing)

12:01.688 --> 12:04.657
(Hissing in effort)
Come on, one more.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.294
Arrrgh!
Yeah. Mmm!

12:07.327 --> 12:09.129
Yes.
Yes!

12:09.162 --> 12:11.398
Killed it, well done!

12:12.565 --> 12:13.934
There he is.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.303
(Laughing)

12:16.336 --> 12:18.005
Let me grab
those for you, man.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.639
Thanks. You know,
that was actually a
good way to hang out.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.108
Yeah, it was amazing.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.675
So, should we go
grab some lunch now?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.812
Oh, dude I would love to

12:24.845 --> 12:26.947
but I have to stay,
finish my work.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.448
Yeah, but maybe next
time, though, okay?

12:28.481 --> 12:29.616
Yeah, grab a beer
or something.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.385
So, cash or credit,
what do you want to do?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.420
What?

12:33.453 --> 12:34.788
Between you and me
it would be for free

12:34.822 --> 12:36.589
but, um, I have my boss.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.259
He's on my case so I have
to charge you for the hour.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.328
Okay, I thought... Uh...

12:41.361 --> 12:42.729
Sorry.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.464
All right, how much is it?
500.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.532
Seriously?

12:45.565 --> 12:48.001
(Laughing)
No.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.470
You get a friend
discount. 350.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.239
(Laughing)
Okay? Yeah.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.206
You got this.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.245
(Clearing throat)

12:58.278 --> 12:59.446
Hello.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.513
Hello.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.083
My name is
Mr. Poshingtonrich.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
I'm from England.

13:04.484 --> 13:08.255
I would like to return
this sweater.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.857
There is a stain.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.158
Oh, dear!

13:11.191 --> 13:12.893
Not jolly good at all!

13:12.926 --> 13:15.762
How can you sell
stained clothes?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.031
Young lady, you may
not have heard

13:18.065 --> 13:20.333
of Mr. Poshingtonrich,

13:20.367 --> 13:22.335
but I can buy
everything here

13:22.369 --> 13:25.138
and turn it into
a parking garage.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.841
Would you like to work
in a parking garage?

13:34.347 --> 13:36.283
(Paper crinkling)

13:39.386 --> 13:40.353
Thank you.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.697
(Cell phone ringing)

13:51.664 --> 13:53.633
Gustaf:
Emma:

14:13.987 --> 14:15.422
(Sighing)

14:15.455 --> 14:19.159
I can't believe Gustaf and I
share the same gene pool.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.861
You really hit the jackpot
with Chuck, huh?
I know.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.731
A new friend and
also free exercise.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.566
Yeah. I mean, it wasn't
totally free, but...

14:28.001 --> 14:29.802
You had to pay for it?

14:29.836 --> 14:32.105
Yeah. But I mean,
you can't put a price
on friendship, so...

14:32.139 --> 14:34.541
Seems to me like
Chuck just did.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.243
Are you sure
he's a friend?

14:36.276 --> 14:38.478
I mean, he could
be a really nice
personal trainer.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.048
No. God, he's a friend.
Sorry.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.416
Yeah, I mean, what do you
think, you can just
walk up to someone too

14:43.450 --> 14:44.985
and be like, "Hey, excuse
me, are you my friend?"

14:45.018 --> 14:47.454
Like... People don't
work like that, okay?

14:48.821 --> 14:50.423
Plus I have a little
bit of dignity left.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.759
(Chuckling)
I don't know, babe.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.627
Okay, good night.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.063
Good night, Emma.

14:56.096 --> 14:56.997
(Click)

15:00.000 --> 15:01.701
(Click)
Okay, you know what? This has
been going on long enough.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.336
(Click)
What?

15:03.370 --> 15:05.072
The world needs
more love, not less.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.407
Okay, just a quickie,
I'm really tired.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.209
What...? No!

15:09.242 --> 15:10.877
God, no.
No?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.745
I mean, yes,
eventually,

15:12.779 --> 15:14.847
but right now
I'm talking about the
"I love you" thing.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.516
Oh, okay.
Yes.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.952
What do you think
people regret most
on their death beds?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.754
Saying "I love you"
too much or not
saying it enough?

15:21.788 --> 15:24.024
Um...
It's not a trick question,
it's the second one.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.725
Okay. Mm-hm.
I mean, when's
the last time

15:25.758 --> 15:27.594
you told your parents
you love them?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.429
Never.
Never?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.930
No... I said never,

15:30.964 --> 15:32.865
so, not once.
Oh my god, that's crazy!

15:32.899 --> 15:33.900
You should!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.768
People should
say it more often.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.737
And I'm going to say it.
I love you, you're going
to have to deal with it.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.107
All right? And you know
what else I'm going to do?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.975
Don't call my parents.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.544
Don't call your...
You think I would honestly
call your parents?

15:44.577 --> 15:45.878
That is like the
last thing I would do.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.347
No, I'm going
to call Chuck.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.116
Because I'm going to invite
him over for dinner,

15:49.149 --> 15:51.084
and then I can prove to you
that he's a real friend.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.785
You'll see.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.287
We saw each other today

15:54.321 --> 15:57.357
so it might seem a little
weird to call right now.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.392
Uh... I should give
maybe a day or two.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.230
I'm going to call him
tomorrow, that's better.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.434
Okay...

16:07.467 --> 16:09.402
(Snoring)

16:12.239 --> 16:13.273
(Whispering)
I love you.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.973
Hey, aren't you
the King of Luxembourg?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.617
(Frustrated sigh)

17:32.152 --> 17:33.253
(Zipper unzipping)

17:33.286 --> 17:34.554
That's what
I'm talking about.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.323
Swedes know exactly
how to work out.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.824
Beautiful.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.260
Hey! My buddy,
my pal, Bruce!

17:40.293 --> 17:42.629
What's up, man?
So, I've been thinking.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.664
How about we take
what we've got here

17:44.697 --> 17:46.899
to the next level?
Step it up.
(Sigh)

17:46.933 --> 17:49.236
I'm so happy to hear
you say that, because
I was thinking the
exact same thing.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.904
Well, I guess great minds
think alike, right?
Yeah.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.240
So we want to have
you over for dinner.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.874
Oh!
Yeah!

17:54.907 --> 17:58.845
That is... exactly...
what I was thinking.

17:58.878 --> 17:59.879
Okay, so we're on.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.381
We are so on.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.015
And on that note,

18:03.049 --> 18:05.285
how would you like
to be a full time
member at the gym?

18:09.088 --> 18:12.792
Viveka:

18:12.825 --> 18:13.726
(Electronic beep)

18:25.938 --> 18:28.875
(Music)

18:28.908 --> 18:30.109
You've got to try this.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.746
Mmm.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.781
It's good, right?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.048
Oh, I'm looking
forward to that.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.618
I know, me too.
I can't wait.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.388
(Sigh)
So, uh...

18:41.421 --> 18:42.622
What time
are they coming?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.457
Stop it, okay?
They'll be here.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.659
Yes, honey.
They're just running
a little late.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.261
I mean, I just find
it a little odd

18:48.295 --> 18:49.596
that he also
wanted you to sign up

18:49.629 --> 18:52.465
for a full year at
the gym, but that's...

18:52.499 --> 18:54.601
No, no, that was for
a discounted friend price.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.636
Mmm.
So that's not
strange at all.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.070
He'll be here.
Mm-hm.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.172
(Door bell chiming)

18:59.206 --> 19:00.673
Ha-ha! Mm-hmm.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.475
In your face.
(Giggling)

19:02.509 --> 19:04.143
I told you
they'd be here.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.111
Chuck...

19:08.415 --> 19:10.350
(Muffled voices, footsteps)

19:10.383 --> 19:12.285
(Whimpering)

19:39.045 --> 19:40.880
(Laughing)

19:45.652 --> 19:47.086
Bruce:
Oh, no...
What?

19:47.119 --> 19:48.120
They're not coming.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.556
Aw...
I know.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.023
Chuck sent me a text.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.993
He says there is some sort
of water leak at the gym.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.595
Water leak?
I know...

19:55.628 --> 19:57.364
You do know what
this means, right?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.998
Yes.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.533
It means I've got
to go down there
and help him out.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.101
No. That's not what it...

20:02.134 --> 20:04.837
Emma, that's what
friends do, okay?

20:04.871 --> 20:05.872
It's good to see you guys,
I love you.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.809
Chuck:
(Shouting indistinctly)

20:09.842 --> 20:12.111
Two more, come on!
One more!

20:12.144 --> 20:13.846
You did it, baby!
You a lion!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.348
You are the beast!

20:15.382 --> 20:17.917
What's going on here?
What's going on here?

20:17.950 --> 20:20.287
(Stammering)
You said there
was a water leak!

20:20.320 --> 20:22.389
There's no... How could
you do this to me?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.990
I mean, I thought we...

20:24.023 --> 20:25.858
I gave you the
three-part handshake.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.327
You think I just do
that with anybody?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.695
I only do that
with cool people.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.029
I thought you were, but...

20:30.062 --> 20:32.031
You're not cool,
okay? You're not.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.300
You're like
the opposite of cool.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.535
You're like... hot.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.571
It's not...
You know what I mean,
because it's not...

20:38.605 --> 20:40.340
(Exasperated sigh)
I'm having trouble with
my emotions right now.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.974
I'll be honest, okay?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.411
And you, you.
You think this is
going to last? Huh?

20:44.444 --> 20:46.112
You think you've got
something special?
You don't.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.747
He does this
with everyone.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.881
I made you dinner!

20:51.951 --> 20:53.252
Who's ready
for another set?

20:53.286 --> 20:54.287
I am.
You is.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.922
Who's going to
kill it? You...

20:55.955 --> 20:58.224
Watch out, it's
a hippopotamus...
(Grunt)

20:58.257 --> 21:00.327
At least
the food is good.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.895
Is it? I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.364
Honey...

21:04.397 --> 21:06.132
There's a Swedish saying:

21:06.165 --> 21:09.268
"If you lose one,
there are a thousand more

21:09.302 --> 21:12.872
waiting for you when...
you get..."

21:12.905 --> 21:14.941
I don't know, it sounds
so much better in Swedish.

21:14.974 --> 21:15.975
God, I hope so.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.911
But my point is,
it's his loss.

21:18.945 --> 21:19.912
Because you're great.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.687
I love you, Bruce Evans.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.589
Wow. You said it.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.290
(Laughing)
Yeah...

21:31.324 --> 21:32.892
It's a special occasion.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.293
Now that you said that,
I'm going to say

21:34.327 --> 21:37.029
that I really
respect you as well.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.698
(Mock gasp)
Very much, Emma.
You do?

21:38.731 --> 21:41.233
Yes.
Mmm.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.102
I'm just kidding,
I love you...
Yeah, I know, I know.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.238
Bengt:
Oh, I think this is too
Italian for me, actually.

21:46.272 --> 21:49.308
Oh, good God!

21:49.342 --> 21:51.878
Excuse me, sir.
But I have to ask you:

21:51.911 --> 21:56.649
aren't you the
King of Luxembourg?

21:56.683 --> 21:58.685
Oh, but I am.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.087
How did you
recognize me in my...

22:01.120 --> 22:03.122
(Mouthing silently)
ordinary,
everyday clothes?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.891
And who might you be?

22:04.924 --> 22:08.695
I'm Samuel Jackson.
From NASA.

22:08.728 --> 22:13.700
The King of Luxembourg
wishes to return his suit.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.903
Wow, you wouldn't want
the King of Luxembourg

22:16.936 --> 22:18.371
to be unhappy, would you?

22:18.405 --> 22:21.207
* We're not living in America
