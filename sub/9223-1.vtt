You said yourseIf it's not serious.

00:53.062 --> 00:56.816
I hate Dad when he acts Iike that!

00:56.902 --> 01:00.338
Good morning, you survivors!
You want to call? I'd Iove to taIk to you.

01:00.502 --> 01:04.096
We got evicted. We're sleeping
in the car. My wife is pregnant.

01:04.462 --> 01:05.861
You're down about it?

01:05.942 --> 01:09.014
-She's in the car now.
-She's pregnant and sIeeping in the car?

01:09.102 --> 01:10.615
She's there right now.

01:10.902 --> 01:13.257
-What kind of car do you have?
-A Rolls Royce.

01:16.862 --> 01:19.012
Your mom Iistens to KFWB, right?

01:19.222 --> 01:22.498
Ritchie VaIens' mom out there

01:22.582 --> 01:25.255
And she's gotta be proud of her boy today!

01:26.142 --> 01:29.612
Ritchie's got a song headed
for the top of the charts, with a buIIet.

01:29.982 --> 01:33.657
Ritchie VaIens, Come On, Let's Go.

01:36.702 --> 01:38.533
-How are you?
-Pretty good, thanks.

01:39.422 --> 01:40.650
VaIens...VaIens.

01:41.822 --> 01:43.301
French, right?

01:43.742 --> 01:45.061
How did you know?

01:46.502 --> 01:47.821
Come on, man.

01:47.902 --> 01:50.097
He's one of those barrio kids
from the VaIIey.

01:50.182 --> 01:51.171
Not for Iong.

01:51.262 --> 01:52.297
Pretty good.

01:53.942 --> 01:55.091
I know.

02:01.662 --> 02:05.211
Everybody keep it down.
That's my Ritchie on the radio.

02:08.782 --> 02:12.695
-How about a beer?
-Not whiIe I'm working,
but I'II get you one.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.297
No, I'm sorry. Donna's studying.

02:31.982 --> 02:35.577
Supper time, pizza fans!
Here's a contest to kick off summer!

02:35.662 --> 02:39.575
We have a speciaI mystery guest

02:39.862 --> 02:40.931
HeIIo.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.813
Here's what you do. Our guest comes

02:44.902 --> 02:48.497
What does he have in common with the
Vice President of the United States?

02:48.622 --> 02:52.900
The first person to identify the mystery

Thank you.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.413
-She's out on a date.
-Yeah.

03:21.982 --> 03:23.210
Right.

03:32.942 --> 03:34.660
Yes, may I heIp you?

03:35.102 --> 03:36.376
May I see Donna?

03:37.662 --> 03:38.777
PIease.

03:39.142 --> 03:40.495
I know she's here.

03:42.782 --> 03:44.261
Just one moment.

03:47.302 --> 03:48.451
Donna?

03:51.142 --> 03:52.211
It's Ritchie.

03:52.302 --> 03:56.011
Now, it's better not to Iead him on dear.
You know how your father is.

03:57.022 --> 03:58.421
Okay.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.061
Hi, Ritchie.

04:07.022 --> 04:08.375
Can we take a waIk?

04:14.302 --> 04:15.735
No, I can't.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.454
Okay, Iet's not beat around the bush.
Are you seeing other guys?

04:22.902 --> 04:26.338
Yeah, I've been out a few times.
What's wrong with that?

04:27.302 --> 04:28.530
You're my girI.

04:29.622 --> 04:31.533
When am I supposed to see you?

04:32.822 --> 04:36.337
I can't tag aIong to your appearances.
AII those other girIs--

04:36.422 --> 04:38.572
I don't care about those other girIs!

04:41.102 --> 04:42.820
What am I supposed to do?

04:44.662 --> 04:46.892
You don't have time for me right now.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.495
You wanna break it off?

04:55.302 --> 04:57.133
I don't know what I want anymore.

05:00.262 --> 05:01.820
I'II see you around sometime.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.176
Ritchie.

06:33.862 --> 06:34.851
HeIIo?

06:36.182 --> 06:38.776
-Sorry.
-''Oh, Donna

06:39.502 --> 06:41.458
-''Oh, Donna''
-That's it.

06:41.822 --> 06:42.857
That's your song.

06:42.942 --> 06:44.500
Thoughtyou'd like to hearit.

06:44.662 --> 06:45.890
It's beautifuI.

06:46.382 --> 06:47.417
Thank you.

06:47.982 --> 06:49.256
-'Bye.
-Yeah.

06:53.542 --> 06:55.931
Carnal, I think I know
what your probIem is.

06:56.142 --> 06:58.258
And it's time we did something about it.

06:58.462 --> 06:59.941
Come on, Iet's go.

07:00.222 --> 07:01.416
Where to?

07:01.702 --> 07:04.694
Let's just go.
I shouId have done this a Iong time ago.

07:04.942 --> 07:06.375
Come on, hop on.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.660
-Done what?
-Gotten you some taiI, man.

07:26.302 --> 07:27.781
Come on, Ritchie with a ''t.''

07:27.862 --> 07:31.252
I'm going to show you the best part of TJ.

07:33.902 --> 07:35.654
Ritchie, come here. Check it out.

07:35.742 --> 07:39.655
Don't worry. It smeIIs Iike fish,
but it'II taste Iike chicken.

07:40.862 --> 07:42.659
You aIright, man!

07:44.462 --> 07:47.454
This is your manager's job,
getting you some taiI.

07:48.422 --> 07:50.652
He Iooks at you,
I bet he sees a meaI ticket.

07:50.942 --> 07:52.421
Come on, change the record.

07:53.702 --> 07:55.772
Look, man: ''Ritchie VaIens.''

07:57.422 --> 08:00.732
With a name Iike that, nobody's
even going to suspect you're Mexican.

08:02.222 --> 08:04.338
I think it's an insuIt to Steve's memory.

08:05.422 --> 08:08.812
Steve was so gung-ho American,
he'd be proud of anything I do. Lay off.

08:08.902 --> 08:10.574
It's my name.

08:11.702 --> 08:13.454
Yeah, it's your name, man.

08:32.102 --> 08:34.696
-What did she say?
-She Iikes your big....

08:37.422 --> 08:40.015
-What do you think?
-It Iooks Iike a high schooI prom.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.297
OnIy this prom puts out.

09:14.062 --> 09:16.132
Look at those bongos.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.532
Get in there.

09:18.902 --> 09:20.415
I can see fine.

09:21.702 --> 09:22.817
Pick one you Iike.

09:23.382 --> 09:26.055
They'II Iike you. It's guaranteed.

09:32.862 --> 09:36.059
I don't know. It's reaIIy hard to choose.

09:36.462 --> 09:39.101
Shit, take two, man. It's on me.

09:48.142 --> 09:49.575
La Bamba!

09:49.822 --> 09:51.699
Ritchie, come here.

09:52.182 --> 09:54.412
I brought you here to get Iaid.

09:54.502 --> 09:55.696
Later.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.574
I'm coming.

11:03.022 --> 11:04.978
Connie, I need your heIp.

11:05.062 --> 11:08.896
It's the baby.
Where is Bob, for God's sake?

11:12.942 --> 11:16.093
I'm gonna get Ritchie, okay?

11:16.222 --> 11:17.655
It's gonna be okay.

12:19.622 --> 12:21.453
Yo no speak-o espanoI.

12:36.302 --> 12:39.339
What's the idea, Bob,
Ieaving me aIone with this oId man?

12:40.462 --> 12:42.896
I had some business to take care of in TJ.

12:43.182 --> 12:45.412
Besides, you were sIeeping it off, stud.

12:45.822 --> 12:47.141
Was I that drunk Iast night?

12:47.222 --> 12:50.055
You were screwed, bIewed, and tattooed!
Look at that.

12:50.142 --> 12:52.212
WeII, at Ieast tattooed anyway.

12:56.022 --> 12:58.092
The oId man wants us to eat breakfast.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.733
I never had snake before.

13:13.742 --> 13:15.175
It's not bad.

13:23.502 --> 13:24.776
What's he saying?

13:25.822 --> 13:27.892
He says, ''Life is a snake.

13:28.782 --> 13:31.979
''A snake crawIing out of its
own dead skin.

13:32.902 --> 13:34.221
''Like a dream.''

13:37.422 --> 13:39.652
He's a curandero, a heaIer...

13:40.302 --> 13:43.977
...and a wise man.
He's sort of my spirituaI father.

13:45.462 --> 13:47.498
I've been coming to him for years.

13:52.342 --> 13:53.855
He's giving you that.

13:57.502 --> 14:00.255
''To Iive is to sIeep.''

14:03.262 --> 14:04.377
''To die...

14:04.622 --> 14:06.055
''...is to awaken.''

14:09.102 --> 14:11.013
I toId him about your nightmares.

14:12.382 --> 14:15.738
That taIisman wiII heIp,
if you beIieve in it.

14:23.342 --> 14:24.934
What is aII this?

14:38.422 --> 14:42.415
Mexico! You went to Tijuana
without teIIing anybody?

14:42.942 --> 14:45.058
A fine pair of sinvergÃ¼enzas!

14:46.462 --> 14:49.340
I'd expect this from Bob
but not you, Ritchie.

14:50.982 --> 14:54.258
What did you do, drink the night away?

14:54.342 --> 14:56.936
Okay, it was my fauIt. I took him there.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.179
-How's Rosie?
-She's in the hospitaI, where eIse?

15:01.902 --> 15:05.053
She was aII aIone.
I had to drive her to the hospitaI myseIf!

15:05.262 --> 15:07.332
She was in Iabour aII day with the baby.

15:07.422 --> 15:10.653
Do you hear me?
Do you care about anything?

15:11.542 --> 15:13.851
Go ahead! Go pIay with your bike!

15:19.662 --> 15:21.414
Did Rosie have a boy or a girI?

15:21.502 --> 15:24.574
She had a girI. We named her Brenda.

15:26.622 --> 15:27.896
What's this?

15:29.142 --> 15:30.177
Bob.

16:48.662 --> 16:51.222
That's beautiful, Ritchie. That's the one.

16:51.782 --> 16:55.172
Coming up in September,
we have the Pacific Ocean Park...

16:55.742 --> 16:58.176
...foIIowed by
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

16:58.262 --> 16:59.536
High Tone Iunch, huh?

17:00.422 --> 17:02.174
FoIIowed by...

17:03.102 --> 17:04.615
Are you Iistening?

17:05.262 --> 17:08.378
...a week's booking in San Francisco.
Now, Ritchie...

17:08.462 --> 17:09.815
...we fIy up for that one.

17:11.301 --> 17:13.020
FIy? No, I'd rather drive.

17:13.102 --> 17:15.820
Ritchie, pIease. It's a Iong drive.

17:15.902 --> 17:20.054
I don't care. I never fIy, I toId you.
I have my reasons.

17:20.781 --> 17:23.342
AII right, I'II see what I can do.

17:25.582 --> 17:28.175
We stiII need another singIe
to go aIong with Donna.

17:28.262 --> 17:29.775
How about Suzie?

17:31.142 --> 17:32.336
How about La Bamba?

17:32.542 --> 17:35.932
-La Bamba? It's not rock 'n' roII.
-It is the way I pIay it.

17:36.182 --> 17:38.650
It's a foIk song.
I don't want to offend anybody.

17:38.822 --> 17:41.541
-Besides, it's in Spanish.
-That's how I want to sing it.

17:41.622 --> 17:44.136
Rock 'n' roII in Spanish.
You gotta be crazy.

17:44.382 --> 17:46.771
-It'II work. Just Iet me have
a crack at it.
-No.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.179
Even assuming that the other side
of Donna was a throwaway...

17:50.422 --> 17:54.734
...how are you going to handIe the Iyrics?
You say yourseIf you don't speak Spanish.

17:54.822 --> 17:57.541
If Nat King CoIe can sing in Spanish,
so can I, right?

17:58.022 --> 18:00.980
Come on, Bob-O. What do you say?

18:03.062 --> 18:04.336
Bob-O?

18:08.422 --> 18:10.174
Okay, now smiIe!

19:09.542 --> 19:11.055
It drives Iike a dream!

19:11.142 --> 19:13.178
Beats the heII out of taking a train.

19:13.262 --> 19:15.059
How much did this baby cost?

19:15.542 --> 19:17.134
You don't want to know.

19:18.702 --> 19:21.091
But if aII goes weII in PhiIadeIphia...

19:21.862 --> 19:23.454
...the car is yours.

19:23.542 --> 19:24.531
PhiIIy?

19:26.062 --> 19:27.734
We're going to PhiIadeIphia?

19:27.862 --> 19:29.454
American Bandstand.

19:32.182 --> 19:34.742
We fIy up for that. Okay?

19:40.662 --> 19:42.414
Come on, Iet's go.

19:48.902 --> 19:52.212
-I thought you said you didn't Iike to fIy.
-I don't.

19:52.302 --> 19:54.497
But I Iove driving fast.

19:54.662 --> 19:57.381
Let me in, damn it!
I want to see my daughter!

19:57.862 --> 20:01.172
I'm her father! I'm her father, goddamn it.

20:01.262 --> 20:02.820
You're a goddamn drunk!

20:02.942 --> 20:04.614
Bob, stop it.

20:04.902 --> 20:08.258
Get back. Have you gone crazy on me?

20:08.782 --> 20:10.852
I have finaIIy had it.

20:11.382 --> 20:14.294
-I want to see my daughter.
-Not in your condition.

20:14.382 --> 20:17.613
I went pendeja for the motorcycIe,
but no more.

20:17.702 --> 20:19.852
-I want my wife.
-You don't want a wife.

20:19.982 --> 20:22.621
He wants a Iove sIave.
One that he can kick around.

20:22.702 --> 20:25.341
Sober up and you can see her tomorrow.

20:25.422 --> 20:27.856
Now go downstairs and pass out.

20:28.622 --> 20:31.853
I've got enough to worry about
with Ritchie.

20:34.342 --> 20:37.459
You aIways worry more about Ritchie.

20:37.582 --> 20:40.415
What about me?

20:41.102 --> 20:44.014
I know you don't give
a goddamn about me.

20:44.542 --> 20:48.012
You had me turned in!
You had me Iocked up!

20:48.542 --> 20:51.659
Do you think I couId ever
forgive you for that?

20:55.502 --> 20:57.413
You can't keep me from seeing my kid.

20:57.702 --> 21:01.172
This is my house. I'II kick you aII out.

21:10.382 --> 21:11.531
You see anything?

21:12.582 --> 21:16.541
I just saw the Grand Canyon.
It's a Iong way down there, boy.

21:20.342 --> 21:21.616
You okay?

21:28.542 --> 21:29.895
You know what, Bob-O?

21:30.502 --> 21:34.131
I've aIways beIieved
I was going to die in a pIane crash.

21:34.222 --> 21:37.532
That's a heII of a thing to say
whiIe we're stiII in the air.

21:39.622 --> 21:43.581
It's do or die, man.

And away we go.
You are all comfortably seated, I presume.

21:53.782 --> 21:54.737
Excellent.

21:54.862 --> 21:57.581

Ladies and gentleman,

22:44.582 --> 22:46.095
What do you want?

22:47.062 --> 22:48.415
I got money.

22:48.502 --> 22:50.094
I don't want your money.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.935
What the heII?

22:52.102 --> 22:55.777
-I was watching that! Put that back on.
-You've had enough for one afternoon.

22:56.102 --> 22:58.821
Put it back on! That dude's my brother!

22:58.902 --> 23:01.462
Yeah, and I'm your Irish uncIe, too.
Leave it off.

23:32.342 --> 23:34.731
What'd you think of Ritchie
on American Bandstand?

23:34.822 --> 23:38.497
-I think it's so keen that he was on there.

24:38.582 --> 24:40.015
So, how's schooI?

24:40.542 --> 24:44.171
Not the same without you.
When are you coming back?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.580
My schooI days are over, kitten.

24:46.822 --> 24:48.892

24:56.182 --> 24:59.333
AII your success and everything,

25:00.702 --> 25:01.976
I'm fIying.

25:03.782 --> 25:05.374
I'm reaIIy fIying.

25:34.582 --> 25:36.140
It's yours, Mom.

25:36.382 --> 25:38.452
-It's mine?
-Yes.

25:47.742 --> 25:49.334
Come on.

25:51.142 --> 25:54.612
-Is this where we're going to Iive?
-It's Iike a castIe.

25:55.982 --> 25:57.176
This is home.

25:59.982 --> 26:01.574
That's the garage.

26:02.382 --> 26:04.691
Over there is the guest house.

26:06.662 --> 26:08.175
Come on, sIow poke.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.617
Look at this. Isn't it nice?

26:12.102 --> 26:16.015
Right here is where I think
we'II put the swimming pooI.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.895
No, Ritchie, the girIs can't swim.
I don't want no pooI.

26:25.102 --> 26:26.933
We'II make it a dishwasher, right?

26:27.022 --> 26:29.582
No probIem. But after we fIy back east.

26:30.102 --> 26:33.174
-Back again?
-10 day tour, 13 cities.

26:33.542 --> 26:36.261
IncIuding a spot on nationaI teIevision.

26:36.742 --> 26:39.415
So, congratuIations, Mrs. VaIens.

26:39.942 --> 26:42.137
Here are the keys to your new home.

26:42.422 --> 26:45.778
Ritchie, this is better

26:46.382 --> 26:48.134
I Iove you, Mom.

26:48.662 --> 26:50.300
You're the best.

27:25.502 --> 27:27.652
What's the matter? Nervous?

27:27.742 --> 27:29.972
I'm just a kid from Pacoima.

28:17.782 --> 28:19.773
You're gonna knock 'em dead.

28:19.862 --> 28:22.137
Eddie Cochran, a wonderful human being!

28:22.222 --> 28:26.898
And now foryou rock cats, another
wonderful human being, Mr. Jackie Wilson!

28:30.902 --> 28:33.939
Eddie, you were great, man. ReaIIy great.

28:35.102 --> 28:37.332
It's that Iive New York audience.

28:37.462 --> 28:38.178
Rock 'n' roII is an addiction.

28:59.702 --> 29:01.454
Here you are, Ritchie.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.612
Where eIse? The kid's got taste.

29:03.822 --> 29:06.256
I need you, VaIens.
One of the BeImonts got sick.

29:06.382 --> 29:08.771
ProbabIy maInutrition
from this three-ring circus.

29:08.862 --> 29:10.693
-Just kidding.
-I got to move you up.

29:10.782 --> 29:14.695
You're going on after Jackie WiIson.
In five minutes. You can do it.

29:14.782 --> 29:15.771
Good Iuck.

29:15.942 --> 29:17.455
They're waiting for you.

29:17.902 --> 29:19.017
-Let's go!
-Get rocking!

30:34.702 --> 30:38.615
If they Iove you, they'II want to kiII you.
If they don't, same difference.

30:43.382 --> 30:45.293
And here he is...

30:45.622 --> 30:49.695
...America's newest rock 'n'
roll sensation...

30:50.062 --> 30:53.896
...the California Kid, Ritchie Valens.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.373
This is a bit of a rattIesnake.

33:25.022 --> 33:26.614
No, I mean it Bob-O....

33:34.982 --> 33:36.654
Merry Christmas, High Tone.

33:37.782 --> 33:39.215
I've missed you.

33:43.302 --> 33:45.691
Okay, go ahead and open the presents.

33:47.862 --> 33:49.853
Just the IittIe kids.

33:59.222 --> 34:01.372
-Look at aII this food.
-WonderfuI.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.341
-Hungry?
-I couId eat a horse.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.456
Seven and seven?

34:13.302 --> 34:14.337
What about you?

34:14.502 --> 34:16.254
I'm on the wagon, man.

34:16.942 --> 34:18.375
The garbage wagon.

34:19.302 --> 34:21.293
$5 a week and aII you can eat.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.771
With aII this food, I'm staying.

34:28.502 --> 34:30.413
Bobby, where's Mom's new dress?

34:31.141 --> 34:34.214
-What new dress?
-The one I asked you to buy her.

34:35.422 --> 34:38.539
You're the asshoIe with aII the money.
Buy it yourseIf.

34:44.502 --> 34:47.699
Don't Iet him upset you.
He's been on the wagon for a month.

34:47.862 --> 34:51.059
He's meaner when he's drunk.
Come on, heIp yourseIf.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.333
Let's go into the Iiving room.
I got a present for Ritchie.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.102
I just got mauIed by King Kong!

35:14.742 --> 35:16.494
Everybody, Iet's party!

35:16.622 --> 35:19.056
This is a ceIebration. My Ritchie is home!

35:37.062 --> 35:38.097
You okay, Bob?

35:39.902 --> 35:41.335
Sure, I'm okay.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.774
Mom was asking for you.

35:44.702 --> 35:46.135
She afraid I'm drunk?

35:46.222 --> 35:49.453
I've had one sip of beer,
and it tastes Iike piss to me. Want it?

36:09.742 --> 36:11.334
What's your probIem, man?

36:14.822 --> 36:16.335
OId Steve.

36:17.502 --> 36:20.858
He aIways said you'd be somebody.
And I bought it, too.

36:21.982 --> 36:25.338
If that's the way Steve wanted it,
that's the way it was gonna be.

36:26.222 --> 36:29.259
Even after he toId me he wasn't my dad.

36:31.182 --> 36:32.740
Once I knew the fuII score...

36:32.822 --> 36:37.020
...I understood why he aIways
treated you a IittIe bit better than me.

36:38.262 --> 36:41.732
I said, ''I'II just hang around
and take the Ieftovers.''

36:42.422 --> 36:44.299
Like a dog.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.572
That's how much I Ioved Steve.

36:46.862 --> 36:48.215
Like a goddamn dog!

36:48.422 --> 36:50.697
Look, we don't have to taIk
about this now.

36:51.022 --> 36:54.094
Shit! I want to taIk about it now
and you'II Iisten!

36:54.262 --> 36:56.014
This is a crock of shit.

36:56.142 --> 37:00.294
He set you up to conquer the worId,
and he didn't Ieave me shit!

37:00.422 --> 37:02.890
Nobody toId you
to throw your Iife away, man.

37:02.982 --> 37:06.019
I'm onIy sorry I didn't say anything
about your drinking.

37:06.102 --> 37:07.421
You did it to yourseIf.

37:07.502 --> 37:11.051
You come in here
Iike you own the goddamn country.

37:11.262 --> 37:14.937
To me, you'II aIways be the IittIe
asshoIe who foIIowed me around.

37:15.142 --> 37:16.894
Yeah, I foIIowed you around.

37:17.142 --> 37:20.020
I foIIowed you around
'cause I thought you were somebody.

37:20.262 --> 37:21.297
Then.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.453
Don't you waIk out on me!

37:28.782 --> 37:30.852
Don't you taIk to me Iike this!

37:34.902 --> 37:37.018
You wanted her. I'm not Rosie, asshoIe.

37:38.102 --> 37:40.013
You asked for it!

37:40.302 --> 37:42.657
I'II kiII you!

38:05.822 --> 38:08.131
He couIdn't have meant it. He's just hurt.

38:09.102 --> 38:11.662
Your success can't be easy for him.

38:13.622 --> 38:14.737
I Iove you, Donna.

38:14.902 --> 38:16.574
I'II aIways Iove you.

38:18.302 --> 38:20.213
You sound so serious.

38:21.622 --> 38:22.577
I am.

38:25.742 --> 38:27.972
I'm stiII going to marry you
one of these days.

38:29.702 --> 38:31.021
WiII you wait for me?

38:31.182 --> 38:32.774
For how Iong? Forever?

38:37.342 --> 38:38.821
No, untiI I'm 25.

38:38.902 --> 38:42.372
Then I'II have a big gIass cabinet
to keep aII my goId records in.

38:48.542 --> 38:50.055
I Iove you.

38:53.702 --> 38:57.934
I'm never going to Iet anyone get in
the way of my feeIings for you, ever again.

39:02.262 --> 39:04.139
-Come here.
-What?

39:10.422 --> 39:11.616
Come here.

39:40.102 --> 39:43.572
The whoIe heating system in the bus
broke down. The whoIe bus is shot.

39:43.702 --> 39:45.772
You didn't say the tour
wouId be Iike this.

39:45.862 --> 39:47.375
The heII with it, come home.

39:47.462 --> 39:50.260
-You mean quit?
-No. You're sick.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.454
I'm really sorry.

39:54.382 --> 39:57.579
No, I'II stick it out.
But see what you can do about the bus.

39:58.822 --> 40:01.859
Look, take care of yourseIf,
and I'II caII you tomorrow.

40:06.022 --> 40:07.614

40:10.782 --> 40:14.058
Listen, HoIIy's Iining up a pIane

40:15.022 --> 40:17.582
-AII of us?
-Just the headIiners.

40:17.902 --> 40:20.780
You better get with it,
or you'II be out in the coId.

40:20.902 --> 40:25.134
You catching my snow drift, man?
The word is out, aII right?

41:01.102 --> 41:02.091
HeIIo.

41:02.182 --> 41:03.171
HeIIo, Bob.

41:04.302 --> 41:05.496
It's me, Ritchie.

41:08.502 --> 41:10.618
-What's wrong?
-What do you mean?

41:11.182 --> 41:13.252
I can barely hearyou. You sound funny.

41:13.782 --> 41:15.374
I got a coId.

41:16.262 --> 41:17.490
Is Mom there?

41:17.582 --> 41:20.016
No, no one is here.
They aII went to church.

41:20.262 --> 41:21.934
Just me and my daughter here.

41:22.382 --> 41:25.772
I was going to go, but you know how it is.

41:30.542 --> 41:32.214
Sure wish I was there.

41:32.822 --> 41:35.620
Butyou can't have your cake
and eatit, too.

41:37.422 --> 41:38.411
Listen, Bob.

41:40.662 --> 41:43.222
Why don't you fIy to Chicago
and meet me?

41:43.462 --> 41:46.977
We can finish the tour together.
I need some famiIy around me.

41:49.702 --> 41:51.533
Sure you want me around?

41:53.262 --> 41:56.095
After aII that happened and
the shit I said?

41:56.302 --> 41:58.372
Those were your reaI feeIings.

41:59.502 --> 42:01.379
We're stiII brothers, aren't we?

42:09.222 --> 42:10.337
You stiII there?

42:45.462 --> 42:47.373
Look what just roIIed in.

42:50.302 --> 42:51.257
It's coId.

42:52.382 --> 42:54.054
Ritchie, here's the situation.

42:54.582 --> 42:56.254
I heard how you feeI about fIying.

42:56.582 --> 42:58.732
I didn't think you'd be interested.

42:59.022 --> 43:02.298
It's between Tommy and you.
I'II toss this coin.

43:02.702 --> 43:07.173
Whoever wins wiII ride in this pIane
and wiII sIeep in a warm bed tonight.

43:07.382 --> 43:10.818
Whoever Ioses
wiII freeze his ass off on the bus.

43:13.182 --> 43:14.297
Heads!

43:16.422 --> 43:17.537

43:17.782 --> 43:19.852
AIright. Ritchie, Iet's fIy!

43:19.942 --> 43:23.457
AIIsup, back on the bus. Have a good ride.
We'II see you in North Dakota.

43:23.542 --> 43:24.497
Sorry, Tommy.

43:24.982 --> 43:27.337
The first coin toss I ever won.

43:27.742 --> 43:29.334
Come on, Iet's go.

43:32.422 --> 43:34.890
Jesus. You Iook Iike the Three Stooges.

43:47.662 --> 43:50.130
Ritchie, reIax. Everything's cooI.

43:52.022 --> 43:54.582
The sky beIongs to the stars, right?

44:34.902 --> 44:37.541
We interrupt this program
to bring you this bulletin.

44:37.982 --> 44:41.531
Fourpersons, three identified as
nationally famous rock 'n' roll singers...

44:41.982 --> 44:46.453
...died early today in a plane crash,
five miles north of Clear Lake, Iowa.

44:46.582 --> 44:48.812
Buddy Holly, 22, of Lubbock, Texas.

44:49.022 --> 44:51.980
Ritchie Valens, 17,
of Los Angeles, California.

44:52.382 --> 44:56.694
And J. P. Richardson, 29, of Louisiana,
known professionally as The Big Bopper.

44:57.942 --> 45:00.172
Did you hear? Did you hear...

45:00.262 --> 45:02.492
...what the radio said about Ritchie?

45:02.942 --> 45:04.500
Are you sure he said Ritchie?

45:05.662 --> 45:08.540
Oh, my God! What about Connie?

45:17.702 --> 45:19.294
What is it? What's the matter?

45:20.102 --> 45:21.933
You'd better sit down, Donna.

45:25.422 --> 45:27.538
We understand Holly chartered the plane...

45:27.622 --> 45:30.978
...because the tour bus
had broken down several times...

45:31.502 --> 45:33.254
...and had no heating system.

45:39.022 --> 45:41.980
