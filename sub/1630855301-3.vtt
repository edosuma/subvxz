00:36.495 --> 00:39.414
I went to that old boardinghouse
where he was living.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.583
Sorry, can you define "went to"?

00:42.084 --> 00:43.085
Went into.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.880
Did somebody let you in at least?

00:47.464 --> 00:49.049
The door was unlocked. Does that help?

00:49.132 --> 00:51.385
No. That's breaking and entering.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.678
Oops.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.805
What are you doing, Rya?

00:55.305 --> 00:58.433
Well, I found this in the fireplace.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.650
Do you recognize her?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.195
That's the girl from Rockefeller Center.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.574
If the description is accurate,
that's the girl from Rockefeller Center.

01:14.992 --> 01:15.993
Wait a minute.

01:23.041 --> 01:27.671
What-- Do you think these are all victims?

03:32.129 --> 03:33.755
Are you sure you don't want a Coke?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.050
You know it's not even
8:00 in the morning, right?

03:37.926 --> 03:38.927
So?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.392
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.396
We can just sit here in silence.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.941
In for a penny, in for a pound.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.361
My mom used to say that.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.197
Wise woman, she.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.033
How long was this before the incident?

04:02.201 --> 04:03.452
Can we stop calling it that?

04:03.535 --> 04:05.287
What would you prefer? The shooting?

04:09.499 --> 04:10.501
No.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.795
It was about a week.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.925
But you didn't talk about it?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.053
-Not yet.
-Why not?

04:21.136 --> 04:25.766
Because I guess it was what she said to me
that gave me the idea in the first place.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.562
What?

04:32.564 --> 04:35.067
Well, it's just if we hadn't
gone out that morning,

04:35.817 --> 04:37.736
none of this would have ever happened.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.906
There's this guy I like. Jerome.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.994
I see him out, and I mean,
I really like him.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.374
And he likes me and all.
I mean, who wouldn't?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.334
I mean, who wouldn't?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.673
And every time we get close,
I screw shit up royally.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.885
PS, by "close"
in this context I do mean fucking.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.972
Sincere thanks for the Cliffsnotes.

05:07.266 --> 05:12.479
Anytime anyone starts
to matter to me like this, I get cold.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.567
I mean, even my body gets cold.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.863
It's like I'm trapped in a metal box
and it's getting smaller.

05:21.864 --> 05:25.617
I can feel it on me, and I can't breathe.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.495
It's all I feel.
Every other feeling is gone.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.708
If I don't get out, I'll die.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.006
Like I said, it only happens
when I really like someone,

05:39.089 --> 05:43.010
so good news for casual sex anyway.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.305
What happened to you?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.433
Come on. Figure it's pretty obvious.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.643
It's not like it's rocket science
or anything.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.276
Who was it?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.945
A friend of my dad's.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.739
He'd come into my room at night.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.992
The thing about it is
he was actually pretty nice about it.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.163
He never told me he loved me
or anything like that.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.920
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. I get it.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.214
You must think
I'm pretty disgusting now, huh?

06:21.882 --> 06:26.762
Like I said… I get it.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.432
Say more words, Danny Sullivan.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.602
My brother, when he was a kid.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.272
I didn't know you had a brother.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.817
I don't. Not anymore.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.573
And I guess one day
Adam just couldn't take it anymore.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.493
I'm really sorry.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.163
I don't think about it much though.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.043
Not me. He's always on top of me.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.879
See what I did there?

07:01.463 --> 07:02.840
It was hard to miss.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.178
I can feel him
over my shoulder breathing on me.

07:09.638 --> 07:10.639
I smell him,

07:12.182 --> 07:15.644
and then that's when the metal box comes
and he's jammed right inside with me.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.980
Jesus Christ.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.482
Has offered no help thus far.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.070
That's why I'm always running.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.324
Only, I can't ever seem to run far enough.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.081
I would do anything to make him disappear.

07:50.846 --> 07:54.016
Danny, don't you think it's time
we talk about what happened to Adam?

07:57.269 --> 07:58.270
No.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.653
Okay, Danny. So what was your plan?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.575
I wanted to give Ari a second chance…

08:14.494 --> 08:15.495
to be happy.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.124
And me too.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.002
You too? How is that?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.046
A second chance…

08:26.215 --> 08:27.299
at saving someone.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.596
Come on, Danny. Take it. From the three!

08:36.225 --> 08:39.561
-All right. This close.
-Danny, you rang?

08:39.645 --> 08:40.729
What up, Jonny?

08:41.980 --> 08:44.942
-Hey, I'm gonna grab some water.
-All right.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.026
Mike.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.196
Hey.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.280
So, what's up, Danny?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.453
I was wondering
if maybe I could talk to our guy.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.538
What?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.040
That's why you got me.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.418
You reinvest the capital.
I handle the supplier.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.462
-It's a division of labor.
-Yeah. I know that.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.549
But what if I wanted
to buy something besides pot?

09:08.632 --> 09:12.719
What? Coke? I could get you coke.
You think we should start selling coke?

09:12.803 --> 09:14.596
No, Jonny.
I don't want to start selling coke.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.140
Look, I just want to talk to him, okay?

09:18.392 --> 09:20.602
-Well, he lives out in Brooklyn now.
-I know he lives out in Brooklyn.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.355
Jonny, look, I really need this, okay.
I just want to talk to him.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.316
Yo, what are we doing?
We talking or we playing basketball?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.318
-I'm coming.
-You're the money, man.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.903
-So meet me at the train at 3:00.
-Thank you.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.905
Hey. Don't tell Mike.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.121
Hand on the ball. Let's go.
Take the shot. Okay.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.613
He hasn't seen you in a while,
so just let me do the talking, okay?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.781
You told him I was coming, right?

10:17.201 --> 10:20.996
Well, look who's here. You miss me?

10:24.958 --> 10:25.959
Come on.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.732
-So, how's it hanging, man?
-Shut the fuck up.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.816
So what you want?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.361
Friday's our day. Today's not Friday.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.365
Sit down.

10:58.784 --> 10:59.910
Sorry.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.336
-You want a hit?
-No.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.879
It's got a little dust in it.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.131
I'm okay, thank you.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.550
So what you want?

11:15.050 --> 11:17.052
You said something new. Coke?

11:17.594 --> 11:20.973
I mean, profit margin's better,
but I'ma need a bigger deposit up front

11:21.056 --> 11:22.641
if you want me to get the merch.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.520
-Can you get me a gun?
-What?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.522
-What is this?
-Danny, are you serious?

11:28.605 --> 11:29.857
What makes you think I can get you a gun?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.483
-I can pay you.
-You can pay me?

11:31.567 --> 11:32.651
Yeah, I can pay you.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.735
Is that right?

11:35.904 --> 11:36.738
You setting me up?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.073
-We would never set you up.
-Absolutely n--

11:38.156 --> 11:39.408
Shut the fuck up. I'm thinking.

11:46.790 --> 11:47.791
Really want a gun?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.336
I got a gun, but it's expensive.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.387
Gonna cost you way more than money, bitch.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.556
-No.
-Shut up.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.102
Here comes that freak.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.733
I have 350 bucks right here.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.819
Money ain't enough.

12:21.867 --> 12:22.910
I can't.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.828
You can't?

12:25.704 --> 12:27.706
I mean,
I'm looking at your mouth right now,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.958
and I'm feeling like I know better.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.465
This was a mistake.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.133
Whoa.

12:39.218 --> 12:42.429
Don't be sorry. Sit down.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.267
Sit.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.323
Please can't you just sell it to me, man?

13:02.574 --> 13:04.451
So let me get this straight.
You come in my house.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.245
You ask me for a firearm,

13:07.371 --> 13:09.831
-and then you disrespect me?
-I don't mean no disrespect, all right.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.251
But that's what you're doing, Danny.
You're disrespecting me.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.170
So, do you want the gun or no?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.718
-I'll give you a hand job.
-No, Danny.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.596
Which one is it?
Look, I don't got all day.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.890
I'll give you a hand job.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.475
You'll give me a hand job?

13:29.935 --> 13:32.229
Look who's gone all Miss Prissy on me.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.149
Okay. A hand job.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.427
My boy don't like weird in the house.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.055
Come on.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.947
This is bullshit, Danny.
You don't even like guys.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.201
It's not gonna make me gay, Jonny, okay.
I just really need the gun.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.494
-Why?
-Just trust me.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.497
"Trust me"? What the fuck
do you mean "trust me"? Trust me.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.709
Look, I know Angelo.
You do not want to get near him like that.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.962
The fuck is all that whispering?
Cut that shit out. We on the street.

14:39.505 --> 14:40.506
Let's just go home.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.134
-Danny.
-What, are you jealous?

14:44.676 --> 14:49.640
Fuck you.
Do whatever the fuck you want. I'm out.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.562
You coming, or what?

14:59.650 --> 15:00.817
Yeah. Wait up.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.307
Come here. It's more private.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.527
So you really want this, huh?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.448
Where's the money?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.492
Yeah. Here.

15:53.287 --> 15:56.039
You really want this gun, huh?
You need it?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.749
Yeah, I need it. Yeah.

15:59.251 --> 16:03.046
All right. Well, come on.
You know what I want.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.051
No. Kneel.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.138
I want you to suck it.

16:13.432 --> 16:14.725
You said that I can--

16:14.808 --> 16:18.896
Bitch, do not tell me
what the fuck I said.

16:21.148 --> 16:26.987
I'm telling you I want you to suck it.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.071
You get me?

16:30.157 --> 16:34.953
Now, open that pretty mouth. Open up.
Open that pretty mouth.

16:35.037 --> 16:39.416
Yeah. Now, kneel like I told you.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.294
Kneel!

16:44.296 --> 16:46.673
Yeah, there you go.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.259
Yeah.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.013
You know what to do.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.265
-No, I don't know how to--
-Whatever, freak.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.561
Please.

16:59.645 --> 17:00.646
Listen to me.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.857
If you scream,
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.025
You hear me?

17:05.108 --> 17:08.612
Cops won't even look twice. It'd be
one less faggot they have to worry about.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.031
-I just be doing their fucking job. Right?
-Right.

17:16.161 --> 17:20.332
Open up. Open up. Open up.
Yeah. There you go.

17:21.791 --> 17:22.792
Now get to it.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.757
Open that pretty fucking mouth.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.016
My nose!

17:38.100 --> 17:39.726
-Run!
-My nose!

17:39.810 --> 17:41.061
My nose!

17:41.728 --> 17:43.230
-You broke my nose!
-Come on.

17:51.947 --> 17:53.615
-Is this our train?
-Yeah. Go.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.744
Holy fuck.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.836
-Oh, shit.
-Did you get it?

18:05.919 --> 18:06.920
I got it.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.005
I got it.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.759
Oh, my God.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.346
Did you see his face, man?

18:16.430 --> 18:19.308
His nose was totally broken, man.
Like, "My nose."

18:19.391 --> 18:22.060
-Oh, my God.
-It was gushing. Shit.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.146
I can't believe you came back, dude.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.797
Hey.

18:50.881 --> 18:51.882
Hey.

18:52.758 --> 18:53.759
There you go…

18:56.678 --> 18:58.013
Why are you acting so weird?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.142
What do you mean?

19:04.394 --> 19:05.395
Where have you been?

19:08.565 --> 19:09.566
Nowhere.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.738
I was getting you a gift.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.743
Look, just because we talked
yesterday morning

19:19.826 --> 19:21.370
doesn't make us fucking sweethearts.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.041
Okay, fine. Show me.

19:37.761 --> 19:38.762
Holy shit.

19:39.721 --> 19:40.722
It wasn't to use.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.976
I just thought having it
would make her feel safe,

19:44.601 --> 19:46.228
and I wanted to help her.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.521
It was just to have.

19:48.689 --> 19:52.192
-Well, do you like it?
-This is what you're giving me?

19:55.612 --> 19:56.613
Yeah.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.449
What the hell do I need a gun for?

19:59.992 --> 20:05.539
Well, so you won't be scared all the time.
In case he comes back, you know?

20:09.626 --> 20:10.627
It's oddly sweet.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.507
You stole a gun for Ariana, not to use?

20:15.591 --> 20:19.970
I obviously know how it looks.
But I am telling you the truth.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.144
Bang.

20:31.982 --> 20:32.983
Bang.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.237
Bang.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.160
Hands up, motherfucker.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.415
I'll blow your fucking head off.

20:57.216 --> 20:58.217
I don't want this.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.804
Just get rid of it, okay?

21:07.351 --> 21:09.144
Did you even try to get rid of it?

21:11.939 --> 21:12.940
No.

21:14.107 --> 21:18.153
Okay. I just wanna review
what you're saying to me.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.157
-You assaulted someone…
-Jonny assaulted someone.

21:22.241 --> 21:25.536
…in order to steal a gun.
A gun that you had no intention of using…

21:27.579 --> 21:30.332
but that you kept
until you used it in a shooting.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.292
I did not shoot anybody.

21:32.376 --> 21:33.877
Can you see, from where I'm sitting,

21:33.961 --> 21:38.799
how all of this can seem
like it was your idea in the first place?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.560
Jesus Christ!

21:49.643 --> 21:52.354
-Good morning.
-Fuck. Good morning.

21:52.437 --> 21:53.939
Maybe don't leave this sitting out.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.816
Angelo's, I assume?

21:56.942 --> 21:58.485
Jonny told me what happened.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.905
Balls of steel, that boy's got.

22:01.989 --> 22:04.908
Dumb as a rock, but balls of steel.

22:05.534 --> 22:07.870
Maybe you should do some laundry, huh?

22:09.037 --> 22:11.039
I mean, if you hope
to ever actually get laid.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.919
What are you talking about?

22:16.420 --> 22:17.421
Annabelle.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.215
You told her Thursday morning.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.343
Annabelle's coming here?

22:24.428 --> 22:25.679
Does that happen to you a lot?

22:27.431 --> 22:29.516
Is that a frequent occurrence,
forgetting things?

22:30.058 --> 22:31.852
Why do you keep asking me that?

22:33.270 --> 22:34.855
People forget things all the time.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.857
I just have a not-so-great memory.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.904
You don't wanna write that down
in your little pad?

22:43.906 --> 22:44.907
No.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.506
Morning.

23:01.590 --> 23:04.092
Hey, come in.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.849
What are we gonna do today?

23:14.353 --> 23:15.354
A kite?

23:15.437 --> 23:18.190
You say that without the requisite
enthusiasm that a kite deserves.

23:19.650 --> 23:22.152
Apologies. I'm not really a kite person.

23:24.321 --> 23:25.697
Everyone's a kite person.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.115
Apparently not quite everyone.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.036
Hard case, huh?

23:34.790 --> 23:35.999
Bet I can change your mind.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.878
Unlikely. Look, it's just that kites
aren't really my--

23:46.635 --> 23:47.678
I love kites.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.138
Yeah. As expected.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.936
So you're a college girl now.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.271
Yeah.

23:57.354 --> 23:58.522
You like it?

23:59.106 --> 24:01.775
I do.
It's just not what I expected, you know?

24:06.321 --> 24:07.322
Did you wanna go?

24:10.075 --> 24:11.451
Yeah. I think I did.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.204
And then I didn't, I guess.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.291
Why? 'Cause you quit school?

24:19.793 --> 24:22.546
No, it just stopped becoming something
that was gonna happen.

24:26.008 --> 24:27.217
Your shoelace.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.302
Oh, shit.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.386
I got it.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.470
Thanks.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.891
I mean, you still could go.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.518
-You think so?
-Yeah.

24:39.855 --> 24:42.065
Help me up. My ass is asleep.

24:44.818 --> 24:47.571
-You ready to fly a kite?
-Sure. Okay.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.364
Okay.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.286
You know, I wasn't sure.

24:55.287 --> 24:56.747
It was my dad who wanted me to go.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.458
-To college?
-Yeah.

25:00.709 --> 25:01.960
Turned out to be pretty cool.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.379
I think you'd like it.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.089
Yeah, I like the idea of going to college.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.342
-Really?
-Yeah, I think it could be fun.

25:08.842 --> 25:09.843
What would you do?

25:12.054 --> 25:13.055
I used to draw a lot.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.432
-I remember.
-Well, I still do actually.

25:15.516 --> 25:17.601
So maybe some sort of art major.
I don't know.

25:18.393 --> 25:19.394
It could be cool.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.151
Danny Sullivan, famous artist.

25:27.236 --> 25:28.612
It's got a ring to it.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.614
You never know.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.407
It could happen.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.787
Come on! Come on, kite person!

25:49.383 --> 25:50.384
Oh, my God.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.013
Oh, shit. Oh, Go--

25:55.097 --> 25:58.225
Oh, my God. Shit.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.561
Go. Go!

26:02.688 --> 26:05.649
Well, it's official.
I'm a kite person now.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.442
I told you.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.820
Is anyone else home?

26:10.529 --> 26:11.530
I hope not.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.760
Close your mouth. It's unbecoming.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.721
Dry these, please.

26:35.804 --> 26:38.056
Yes, ma'am. You want a beer?

26:39.474 --> 26:40.684
Do you have something harder?

26:40.767 --> 26:43.812
-Sure. Let me just--
-Wait, above the fridge, right?

26:44.438 --> 26:46.064
-Yeah.
-I remember from your party.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.484
Well, you better be right
about no one else being home.

26:50.694 --> 26:51.737
Okay.

26:55.782 --> 26:56.825
God.

26:59.328 --> 27:00.662
Annabelle, did you find it?

27:01.955 --> 27:03.123
Annabelle?

27:08.962 --> 27:09.963
Annabelle?

27:12.132 --> 27:13.217
Did you do these?

27:15.928 --> 27:17.679
Yeah, but they're nothing.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.431
-They're just--
-Danny, these are amazing.

27:20.766 --> 27:26.355
-Really?
-Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Wow.

27:27.314 --> 27:28.357
That's my mom.

27:28.899 --> 27:29.900
Wow.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.069
There's someone coming.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.946
-I didn't hear anything.
-Grab your pants.

27:34.029 --> 27:35.405
-Grab your pants. Go.
-Okay.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.783
-Come on.
-Pants!

27:45.707 --> 27:47.292
Do you know who Lucian Freud is?

27:48.585 --> 27:49.962
He's a painter.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.215
Maybe we could go to the library tomorrow.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.884
I could show you some stuff.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.596
Yeah, I would love that.

28:00.472 --> 28:01.515
Really?

28:01.598 --> 28:02.599
Yeah.

28:04.268 --> 28:05.269
Okay.

28:16.572 --> 28:19.366
My dad has a friend who's an art professor
at Baruch.

28:21.118 --> 28:22.452
Can I show him this?

28:24.371 --> 28:25.372
Really?

28:27.875 --> 28:29.084
You keep saying that.

28:33.630 --> 28:34.715
I keep feeling that.

28:37.843 --> 28:38.844
It's okay.

28:41.305 --> 28:42.890
You're really good, Danny.

28:49.188 --> 28:50.189
Thanks.

28:59.990 --> 29:00.991
It's okay.

29:13.420 --> 29:17.716
-I need to shower first. Okay?
-Yeah.

29:19.426 --> 29:20.427
Okay.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.179
Can I borrow a T-shirt?

29:23.972 --> 29:25.557
Sure. In there.

29:26.183 --> 29:27.184
Okay.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.441
Not that drawer. Sorry, it's that-- Yeah.

29:35.108 --> 29:37.945
What you got in there? Dirty magazines?

30:05.597 --> 30:06.598
Danny?

30:50.309 --> 30:53.228
Danny, what happened that night?

30:55.397 --> 30:57.232
We just went to sleep.

30:59.067 --> 31:00.485
Come on, Danny.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.155
What happened in that house?

32:15.352 --> 32:17.229
Where the fuck you at, freak?

32:22.067 --> 32:23.944
You broke my fucking nose.

32:24.528 --> 32:26.572
Oh, shit. Annabelle.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.157
Annabelle.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.743
-Annabelle, get up.
-What?

32:31.827 --> 32:33.412
-What is wrong? Are you okay?
-It's okay. Come on. Get up.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.705
Dan, where the fuck you at?

32:34.788 --> 32:35.873
-Who is that?
-It doesn't matter.

32:35.956 --> 32:37.291
-What is happening?
-Get in the closet.

32:37.374 --> 32:38.959
-Danny, you're scaring me.
-It's okay.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.586
-Get in the closet.
-What is-- Talk to me.

32:40.669 --> 32:41.920
-What is happening?
-Look, Annabelle.

32:42.004 --> 32:43.630
Please stop. Just stop talking.

32:43.714 --> 32:46.383
He's after me, not you. Just stay here.

32:47.426 --> 32:48.552
You're gonna be okay.

32:48.635 --> 32:49.720
-It's okay.
-Okay.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.598
I can hear you up there!

32:59.229 --> 33:02.357
I want my gun,
and I want your fucking ass!

33:03.233 --> 33:04.276
Fuck.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.495
Angelo, I'll give you the gun back.

33:15.579 --> 33:17.915
You can have it. I just-- Shit. Fuck.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.293
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. I'm s--

33:21.793 --> 33:23.170
You're sorry?

33:23.253 --> 33:25.214
You're sorry, motherfucker?
I'ma show you sorry.

33:36.642 --> 33:38.227
I wouldn't hide, if I was you.

33:43.565 --> 33:45.400
It's only gonna make it worse.

33:54.910 --> 33:57.162
-What have we got here?
-No!

33:57.246 --> 33:59.623
-Fuck-- Yeah. Shut the fuck up.
-No!

33:59.706 --> 34:02.543
-Danny, gun, now.
-Who the fuck are you?

34:04.753 --> 34:08.257
-Danny!
-What do we got here?

34:11.717 --> 34:13.554
Shit. Fucker!

34:31.947 --> 34:34.699
-You were looking for this, huh?
-Please.

34:35.534 --> 34:36.534
No, please.

34:37.870 --> 34:38.996
Who's bitch now?

34:40.539 --> 34:42.498
-Who's bitch now?
-No.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.377
No.

34:49.339 --> 34:50.632
You are bitch.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.554
You pee on yourself.

35:02.644 --> 35:03.854
-Run!
-Okay.

35:06.815 --> 35:08.192
You are safe now.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.574
Annabelle, it's okay.

35:15.657 --> 35:17.659
You're safe now. He's gone.

35:19.119 --> 35:20.454
-Annabelle, it's okay--
-Don't touch me.

35:20.537 --> 35:22.456
-Don't-- Get away from me! G--
-You're safe. Annabelle, it's okay. What--

35:22.539 --> 35:23.707
Get away!

35:25.667 --> 35:27.336
-Annabelle, please.
-Get away from me!

35:27.419 --> 35:29.421
-Leave me alone!
-Stupid boy!

35:30.088 --> 35:31.882
-You bring a gun into my house?
-Yitzhak--

35:31.965 --> 35:33.926
Why? Look at what you made me do!

35:34.009 --> 35:35.886
-What is going on?
-He brought a gun here!

35:35.969 --> 35:36.970
He got it for me.

35:37.596 --> 35:38.722
You part of this too?

35:38.805 --> 35:40.516
You break my rules. You must leave.

35:40.599 --> 35:41.600
-Yitzhak.
-I'm sorry.

35:41.683 --> 35:42.851
You can't just kick me out.

35:42.935 --> 35:43.936
Today.

35:45.562 --> 35:46.396
Both of you.

35:53.695 --> 35:54.696
I'm so sorry.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.658
Yeah, sorry doesn't keep a roof
over your head, does it?

36:02.746 --> 36:03.747
Shit.

36:26.186 --> 36:27.187
Hey.

36:28.814 --> 36:31.900
Danny, what are you doing
still in that house?

36:36.071 --> 36:37.406
Come home. Your mom misses you.

36:37.489 --> 36:38.824
We can talk things over.

36:43.287 --> 36:44.288
Suit yourself.

36:57.009 --> 36:58.010
I'm sorry.

36:59.595 --> 37:01.471
I tried to get him to let you stay too.

37:05.184 --> 37:07.352
You know, maybe you were right
about getting that gun.

37:11.648 --> 37:12.649
Really?

37:13.192 --> 37:14.651
Would you say you felt manipulated

37:14.735 --> 37:17.446
by Ariana into doing
what she wanted you to do?

37:18.071 --> 37:19.281
Not at the time.

37:20.949 --> 37:21.950
And now?

37:25.662 --> 37:26.663
Maybe.

37:27.331 --> 37:28.624
What if I could end it?

37:29.124 --> 37:30.292
Yeah, what if?

37:31.919 --> 37:35.797
What if I knew he wasn't gonna come
for me, not ever?

37:38.550 --> 37:42.054
Well, then you could actually have a life.

37:43.388 --> 37:44.389
Yeah.

37:50.312 --> 37:52.689
Yitzhak literally hides shit
in his sock drawer.

37:52.773 --> 37:53.941
Can you believe it?

37:57.444 --> 37:58.862
That was for just in case.

37:59.363 --> 38:00.781
Well, what if I don't wait?

38:01.448 --> 38:05.494
What if I scare him first,
so I know he's never gonna come back?

38:07.746 --> 38:08.997
But just scare him, right?

38:10.290 --> 38:13.418
But good. No one has to get hurt.

38:14.378 --> 38:16.296
I just wanna scare him the way he did me.

38:17.256 --> 38:19.132
I just don't think that I can do it alone.

38:20.384 --> 38:23.929
The thing they never tell you
is that when you're doing something crazy,

38:25.639 --> 38:27.307
it doesn't feel crazy at the time.

38:30.561 --> 38:32.271
So what was the plan exactly?

38:34.481 --> 38:36.525
Wave the gun. Shoot over his head.

38:37.776 --> 38:39.027
Scare him.

38:41.738 --> 38:45.993
The incident with Angelo,
and Yitzhak kicking you out,

38:46.577 --> 38:51.582
is it possible that you felt
like you had reached a limit?

38:52.457 --> 38:55.711
Maybe felt compelled to attack?

38:57.546 --> 38:59.965
You're making it seem
like it was all me again.

39:02.217 --> 39:04.344
I didn't do this alone. You know that.

39:05.762 --> 39:06.763
Thank you.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.435
Did Ariana tell you
where you could find him,

39:12.394 --> 39:13.770
the man who raped her?

39:18.066 --> 39:21.653
She said he liked to go to OTB
on Fridays after work.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.073
Doesn't that strike you as strange?

39:25.157 --> 39:28.493
No, why would it?
Lots of people go to OTB. It's--

39:29.536 --> 39:31.246
I just thought it was a coincidence.

39:35.751 --> 39:36.877
Who was it?

39:40.964 --> 39:42.925
Hey! Stop!

39:44.468 --> 39:46.386
Danny, who was it?

39:56.438 --> 39:57.606
It was Marlin.

39:59.024 --> 40:00.734
How could it be Marlin, Danny?

40:03.862 --> 40:05.906
Danny, what are you doing? Just shoot!

40:11.119 --> 40:12.454
I'm gonna ask you again.

40:13.539 --> 40:17.918
How could Ariana's rapist
be your stepfather?

40:20.170 --> 40:21.171
I don't know.

40:23.465 --> 40:27.010
I thought maybe that Marlin knew her dad.

40:29.596 --> 40:33.767
Both you and Ariana lived
in the same house, how?

40:35.227 --> 40:36.436
By coincidence?

40:37.521 --> 40:39.690
It seems unlikely, doesn't it?

40:41.358 --> 40:43.944
Come on, Danny.
You must have thought about that, right?

40:45.779 --> 40:48.073
-How could that be?
-What do you want me to say?

40:48.156 --> 40:49.575
I don't want you to say anything.

40:49.658 --> 40:52.494
That this whole thing was a setup
from the start, is that it?

40:54.830 --> 40:55.831
What if it was?

40:57.457 --> 41:00.502
-What?
-A setup. A setup for what?

41:03.172 --> 41:05.048
Take this. Take the passports.

41:05.132 --> 41:06.633
Go find your father.

41:07.384 --> 41:08.510
Well, isn't it obvious?

41:09.720 --> 41:11.555
That's what they wanted from me all along.

41:12.514 --> 41:14.516
Since the moment they showed up
at that house,

41:15.350 --> 41:17.144
they wanted me to go and find my father.

41:20.439 --> 41:21.815
So that's what I did.
