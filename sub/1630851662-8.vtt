WEBVTT

00:23.898 --> 00:24.774
Argh!

00:27.861 --> 00:29.738
Don't
move a muscle.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.826
Wow, I am
completely at your mercy.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.745
You...

00:36.828 --> 00:39.664
I suppose now
you bring me to justice,

00:39.748 --> 00:42.959
let your new friends
interrogate me.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.295
I wonder if your position's
secure enough

00:45.378 --> 00:48.923
to survive them learning
everything I know.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.475
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.060
Surrender is your only option.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.647
I will keep my daughter
and the two apostate Shadows

01:04.731 --> 01:08.359
for, of course, an example
must be made of them.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.195
You, Artemis Crock,

01:10.278 --> 01:13.239
will be allowed
to leave unharmed.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.283
Take it
or leave it.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.542
- Supper's ready!
- Thanks, Ma.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.585
Pa and I just want to
get the tractor up on blocks.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.920
- Then we'll be right--
- Oh, no.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.380
You two will get to talkin'

02:10.463 --> 02:12.590
and we'll be waiting
on you for an hour.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.760
Put that thing down
and come wash up.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.637
Yes, ma'am.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.639
Gotta learn
that trick, Martha.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.725
I've got
a feeling you have tricks
of your own, Lois.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.645
How does fried chicken
and cornbread sound, Jonny?

02:25.728 --> 02:27.939
Great! Will Uncle Conner
be here?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.993
Tigress, listen.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.911
Orphan's working on her chains,
but she needs time.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.872
<i>Stall.
Keep the bad guys talking.</i>

02:43.955 --> 02:45.582
There's one thing
I need to know.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.751
Were all your confessions
just an act?

02:48.835 --> 02:51.921
Not the facts.
Those were all true.

02:52.005 --> 02:56.134
My father did kill my sister.
But that was a mercy.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.344
And as for my mother
and her family,

02:58.428 --> 02:59.804
I'm thankful

02:59.888 --> 03:04.100
Vandal Savage saved me
from such a mundane life,

03:04.183 --> 03:07.937
elevating me to a destiny
of greatness at his side.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.231
So these half-truths

03:10.315 --> 03:12.942
and the Glamour Charm
that faked your injuries?

03:13.026 --> 03:16.070
All designed to engender
instant sympathy.

03:16.154 --> 03:20.116
So this was
never about putting a mole
on the team.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.327
Yawn!
Been there. Done that.

03:22.410 --> 03:26.122
No. This was about my daughter.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.207
Maybe a little.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.334
But I'm guessing

03:29.417 --> 03:31.336
the main objective
was infiltrating

03:31.419 --> 03:33.504
the Justice League's
computer system.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.591
<i>Stealing our intel's
been a long-term goal
of the Light</i>

03:36.674 --> 03:39.385
<i>since the day I first joined
the Team ten years ago.</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:41.179
A little longer. I'll send
specs to your HUD,

03:41.262 --> 03:42.680
<i>so you can give them
something to brag about.</i>

03:42.764 --> 03:44.349
The Shadows
used the Fog then, too.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.434
But this? This was next level.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.519
Organic Infiltrators.

03:48.603 --> 03:52.148
They had the advantage
of being undetectable
to your scans.

03:52.231 --> 03:53.733
But the disadvantage

03:53.816 --> 03:56.444
of having a short range
and brief shelf life, right?

03:56.527 --> 03:58.237
Minor inconveniences.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.616
All I required was
a distraction to deploy them.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.451
So I was just a distraction?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.954
I swear I didn't
know they were using me.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.331
It would hardly have worked
if you did.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.501
You never developed
the proper espionage skills.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.003
You were never
truly with the program.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.840
<i>Always unfavorably comparing life
here on Santa Prisca</i>

04:17.924 --> 04:19.676
<i>with how it was
on Infinity Island</i>

04:19.759 --> 04:21.469
<i>under Ra's al Ghul and Sensei.</i>

04:21.552 --> 04:24.847
<i>So I approached my sensei
with these concerns.</i>

04:24.931 --> 04:27.266
<i>I had
similar suspicions</i>

04:27.350 --> 04:29.018
<i>and put them to the test.</i>

04:29.102 --> 04:33.189
You let me overhear your plan
to place Cassandra as a mole!

04:33.272 --> 04:34.691
We gave you every chance

04:34.774 --> 04:37.026
to prove us wrong
by doing nothing.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.904
<i>Instead,
you proved yourself a failure</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:42.115
by attempting an escape
which we allowed

04:42.198 --> 04:45.535
so that you might warn
the heroes which also
suited our plans.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.038
As your arrival created
confusion and prolonged
any decision

04:49.122 --> 04:51.124
<i>about my future with the team.</i>

04:51.207 --> 04:55.003
Giving you the opportunity
to fulfill your mission.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.130
<i>The fight
at the Vault was staged</i>

04:57.213 --> 04:58.965
<i>to get you close
to your target</i>

04:59.048 --> 05:01.009
<i>while keeping us distracted.</i>

05:01.092 --> 05:02.844
Not recognized.
Access Denied.

05:02.927 --> 05:06.222
<i>So that you could
release your organic fog.</i>

05:06.305 --> 05:09.183
<i>And reclaim it
almost as quickly.</i>

05:09.267 --> 05:12.145
Then all I needed was
to get back to Santa Prisca

05:12.228 --> 05:14.188
to transfer the data
to the Light.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.816
Too bad we screwed
that last bit up for you.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.985
Betcha Daddy
won't like that.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.905
The Light may be disappointed.
But I am not.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.657
I have my daughter back.

05:27.201 --> 05:30.621
Night vision! Now!
Shadows, hold the door!

05:49.015 --> 05:50.475
You used me!

05:50.558 --> 05:54.145
Please. You're lucky anyone
could find a use for you.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.788
Tigress, Orphan's
not ready for Shiva.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.790
<i>We can't ask her
to fight her own mom.</i>

06:14.665 --> 06:15.875
Right.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.384
Switch dance partners!

06:42.568 --> 06:43.945
Ha! Gotcha!

06:47.406 --> 06:49.408
No.
No! No! No!

07:12.473 --> 07:14.225
Artemis!

07:14.308 --> 07:15.685
Generators are back online!

07:15.768 --> 07:16.978
Enough is enough!

07:17.061 --> 07:18.521
Get those
lights back up!

07:21.274 --> 07:25.027
Again, surrender
is your only option.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.705
What happened?

07:39.542 --> 07:40.751
Push them back in!

07:50.970 --> 07:55.683
Jonny, we talked about this.
Uncle Conner passed away.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.561
I know. He can't
come to our house

07:58.644 --> 08:00.062
'cause he "passed it away".

08:00.146 --> 08:02.940
But every time we come to
Grandma and Grandpa's house

08:03.024 --> 08:05.193
Uncle Conner meets
us here with Wolf.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.903
Every time.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.571
And Wolf's here.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.699
So Uncle Conner
won't pass us away now!

08:11.782 --> 08:14.410
Jonny, your uncle has died.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.662
This means that
the part of his journey

08:16.746 --> 08:20.208
where his body
is alive is over.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.211
His body doesn't
breathe anymore,

08:23.294 --> 08:25.254
it doesn't play anymore.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.008
And, well, we don't get to
spend time with him anymore.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.510
Why?

08:33.179 --> 08:38.267
Inside a living body,
there are many little parts

08:38.351 --> 08:40.770
that each do an important job

08:40.853 --> 08:43.272
to keep a body
healthy and alive.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.609
Now if some of these parts
stop doing their jobs,

08:46.692 --> 08:50.446
the body can
stop working and die.

08:50.529 --> 08:53.908
And that's what
happened to Uncle Conner.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.952
But even though
we don't get to see

08:56.035 --> 08:58.746
or spend time
with Conner anymore,

08:58.829 --> 09:01.290
because his body is dead,

09:01.374 --> 09:05.628
your memories of him
will always be alive...

09:05.711 --> 09:08.631
in your head
and in your heart.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.716
And these pictures

09:10.800 --> 09:13.678
can remind you
of those memories.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.597
And we believe
that when our journeys end,

09:16.681 --> 09:20.810
we will see him
and everyone we love again.

09:21.978 --> 09:22.979
Huh.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.028
You dare betray me?

09:31.112 --> 09:34.532
I owed Cheshire a debt.
She and I are now even.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.825
Agreed.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.160
Well, we are not even.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.498
No. Which is why
I hereby tender my resignation

09:42.581 --> 09:44.417
to the League of Shadows.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.960
From this point forward,

09:46.043 --> 09:48.921
the Shade
is strictly freelance.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.807
The New Genesphere has you
in her sights, Shiva.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.809
Do not move.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.395
Onyx, Orphan. Get Tigress
aboard and dress her wound.
Keep the pressure on.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.480
I admit I cannot
prevent your escape.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.024
Ow!
And I will

10:08.107 --> 10:09.817
even cede Cheshire and
Onyx's departure

10:09.900 --> 10:12.028
despite their crimes
against the Shadows.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.948
But I must insist
you leave my daughter behind.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.533
Not going to happen.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.785
My shadows are everywhere.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.203
You know this, Cassandra.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.998
They watch your friends,
your comrades.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.042
Stay with me, daughter,

10:26.125 --> 10:29.920
else my Shadows shall hunt down
every one you care about.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.464
That's
a poor bluff, Shiva.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.382
And with one word from me,

10:33.466 --> 10:37.303
your friend Barbara Gordon
will be dead before you return
to Gotham.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.473
Orphan, no!

10:40.556 --> 10:43.142
Let her finish it,
Sis. It's better for all of us,
believe me.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.895
No! We don't turn kids
into killers!

10:50.608 --> 10:53.319
<i>Orphan, stop.
This isn't what you want.</i>

11:06.332 --> 11:09.085
Please, Cassandra,
you're free now.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.380
You don't have to be the weapon
your mother tried to create.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.592
I wasn't trying
to save Joker...

11:16.675 --> 11:19.887
I was trying to save... you.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.824
Whom do you think
you are fooling, child?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.450
I saw it in your eyes.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.411
You are still an assassin.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.996
In allowing
these people to adopt you,

11:46.080 --> 11:48.082
you believe
you have rejected me,

11:48.165 --> 11:50.000
declared yourself an orphan.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.961
But you are no orphan.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.422
You are Cassandra Wu-San.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.800
Come back to your mother
when you are ready to admit

11:57.883 --> 11:59.802
who you really are!

12:19.989 --> 12:21.323
Didn't think so.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.077
So like the Cheshire Cat,
I'll just disappear.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.915
Then she just let me go.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.752
I Hate to say it, but Crush--
Sportsmaster was right.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.087
She's weak, Sensei.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.549
She is family, Jade.
Recruit her.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.512
I'm telling you,
Dad was right about her.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.514
Jade's just like him.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.516
She's family, Artemis.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.894
You did the right thing
letting her go.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.896
The justice system
won't turn Jade.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.772
Only family can do that.

12:53.856 --> 12:58.068
But Jade's afraid
to open her heart
and be part of a family.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.738
She doesn't want
to take that risk.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.574
Doesn't want
the responsibility.

13:03.657 --> 13:07.620
Unfortunately,
she got that from me.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.330
When you were both little,

13:09.413 --> 13:13.334
I abdicated all responsibility
to your father.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.544
He wanted to train you.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.421
I wanted to walk away.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.467
It took this chair,
six years in prison

13:21.550 --> 13:25.471
and losing my family
to teach me these lessons.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.057
I hope Jade is a quicker study.

13:28.140 --> 13:32.436
If you see her again,
you must convince her.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.533
There.
You'll be good as new.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.076
Then I'm making the call.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.453
I can't believe I'm letting you
talk me into this.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.747
You want me to talk you
into this.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.542
<i>Hey, Artemis, What's up?</i>

13:54.625 --> 13:55.834
Hi, Will.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.420
Uh, Listen, I wanna ask
your permission

13:58.504 --> 14:01.006
to bring someone
over to the house.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.841
<i>Another stray?</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:04.218
You could say that.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.512
<i>Is that Aunty Mouse? Hi!</i>

14:06.595 --> 14:07.930
Hi, baby girl.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.058
Aunty Mouse,
look what I made

14:11.141 --> 14:12.685
It's a Mommy-Mask!

14:14.853 --> 14:17.106
Wait! Will, Lian, I'm sorry.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.984
It's a great mask,
but I have to call you back.

14:23.028 --> 14:23.988
Jade!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.157
Jade...

14:35.583 --> 14:38.752
Jonny's asleep. He seems okay.

14:38.836 --> 14:42.506
I'm glad Jonny's okay.
'Cause I'm not.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.217
If I had gotten to Mars
five minutes sooner...

14:45.301 --> 14:47.803
You would have died
alongside Conner,

14:47.886 --> 14:51.849
leaving your son without a
father and me without you.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.351
I know that sounds
selfish, but--

14:54.435 --> 14:55.978
I'm the selfish one.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.647
Ten years ago,
I couldn't get over myself.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.858
I had all these
excuses, suspicions.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.611
All this misplaced blame.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.322
I couldn't see him
for who he was.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.532
I wasted so much time.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.659
But you fixed that.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.871
Conner knew you loved him
like a brother.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.665
And he felt the same
about you.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.417
Loving each other...

15:19.418 --> 15:22.504
that's all any of us can do.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.258
I hope you're right.
God, I hope you're right.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.017
How far ahead is she?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.769
<i>Her stolen helicopter
has about ten minutes on you.
But you're gaining.</i>

15:36.852 --> 15:38.646
And she's still on course
for Infinity Island?

15:38.729 --> 15:41.440
<i>Still. Yes.
Why would she go there?</i>

15:41.523 --> 15:42.775
I have no idea.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.485
And I can't believe
you tagged my sister.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.527
Didn't you trust her?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.112
<i>Of course not!</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:49.657
<i>But I tagged all of you.
Wasn't gonna lose anyone else.</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:53.535
Still like to know whose voice
is coming out of that little
bat-bug.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.246
There she is!

16:29.113 --> 16:31.949
I'm not sure why you came,
but you have to see

16:32.032 --> 16:33.951
you are following
in Dad's footsteps.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.953
You know that's not the way.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.663
I'm nothing like dad!

16:40.040 --> 16:43.585
Listen, Mouse,
you want this cat to change?

16:43.669 --> 16:47.423
Why? So I can join
your little playgroup?

16:47.506 --> 16:51.427
Kind of pointless when they're
gonna kick you out any minute.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.470
They're never
gonna trust you.

16:53.554 --> 16:58.225
Not unless you tell them
the truth and bring me in.

16:58.308 --> 17:03.063
I'm betting
you can't bring yourself
to do either, right?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.316
Didn't think so.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.203
She's turning!

17:44.104 --> 17:48.358
Another assault on my
meditation space.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.403
The Great One
will not be pleased.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.822
You again.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.325
Did you come back
to live or to die?

17:58.285 --> 18:00.704
Ah, to die, then.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.544
Artemis, get out of the way.
This needs to end now!

18:07.628 --> 18:09.004
What are you talking about?

18:09.087 --> 18:10.923
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

18:11.006 --> 18:13.008
- Yes, she is.
- No!

18:13.091 --> 18:15.093
She knows she has
no fight here,

18:15.177 --> 18:17.304
save the fight
she has with herself.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.848
Artemis, please.
Just go back home.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.851
Ah. She doesn't want witnesses.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.853
That's not it! I'm...

18:24.937 --> 18:27.064
I'm just sending her
back where she belongs.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.024
Home. With Will and Lian.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.943
I am only living there
because you left.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.152
I had to leave!

18:32.236 --> 18:33.695
Because you
couldn't be bothered?

18:33.779 --> 18:35.239
Because you couldn't
handle the responsibility?

18:35.322 --> 18:36.448
No!
Then why?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.034
Because I'm too much like Dad!

18:42.538 --> 18:46.458
I don't want Lian
turning out like me.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.963
We are both children
of our parents.

18:51.046 --> 18:56.718
But at some point,
we decide who we want to be.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.055
Our parents,
our upbringing,

19:00.138 --> 19:03.141
none of that has to define us.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.935
Aren't I proof

19:05.018 --> 19:07.855
DNA doesn't define destiny?

19:07.938 --> 19:10.816
I chose my destiny
a long time ago.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.652
It's never too late
to change your mind

19:13.735 --> 19:16.405
to change who you are.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.950
But changing takes time
and work.

19:20.033 --> 19:24.329
You've just got to be willing
to put both in.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.583
Maybe with a little help
from family,

19:27.666 --> 19:32.337
say, a sister
who still loves you.

19:32.421 --> 19:36.592
You mean a sister who lives
with my ex and my daughter?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.552
I can't take you
away from them,

19:38.635 --> 19:41.138
and I can't
be a part of their lives.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.598
Not yet.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.933
Maybe not ever.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.561
- Yes, you can--
- Don't you get it?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.605
I wouldn't be joining them.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.942
I'd be bringing them
into my cage with me.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.111
We all build
our own cages.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.282
It gives us something
to run away from.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.702
See, I was raised
by my maternal grandfather.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.955
Will Everett,
"The Amazing Man".

20:07.039 --> 20:10.500
He was good to me,
but I felt trapped.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.296
Papa Willie was always
more Booker T than Malcolm X.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.466
He believed
in leading by example,
doing the right thing,

20:17.549 --> 20:22.137
which sounds great,
but it would never be enough.

20:22.221 --> 20:26.808
The world was never
going to just catch up
and recognize our worth.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.562
Even as a kid, I was--
I was frustrated and angry.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.481
I wanted more.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.858
Then, Sensei found me,

20:34.942 --> 20:37.235
promised I could make
a difference,

20:37.319 --> 20:40.364
change the world,
throw off the old order.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.366
So I ran away.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.369
And here on Infinity Island,

20:45.452 --> 20:48.872
the Shadows
felt like my new family.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.626
Yeah. The Shadows
did better by me
than Sportsmaster ever did.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.379
That was
a very low bar.

20:55.462 --> 20:59.633
Certainly by now,
you both understand
that what you experienced here

20:59.716 --> 21:04.388
was not family...
but manipulation.

21:04.471 --> 21:08.767
Of course, the Shadows
kept an eye on the daughters
of Sportsmaster

21:08.850 --> 21:11.186
and the granddaughter
of Amazing Man

21:11.269 --> 21:13.730
from the moment each was born.

21:13.814 --> 21:18.068
Thus when we saw opportunities
to take you, we did.

21:18.151 --> 21:22.739
My role was to create loyalty.
To create fanatics...

21:22.823 --> 21:27.160
A job I did too
well on Lady Shiva.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.122
But Papa Willie...

21:30.205 --> 21:32.541
He died a few years later.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.918
I left a man who loved me.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.712
He loved me,
and I never saw him again

21:36.795 --> 21:41.174
Exactly. I'm glad
you finally understand.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.052
The shadows made you
into weapons.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.429
But, per the Master,

21:45.512 --> 21:47.723
we are no longer
in that business.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.600
I believe we can help
the both of you now,

21:50.684 --> 21:53.520
but only if you
approach your rehabilitation

21:53.603 --> 21:56.606
with open eyes.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.484
I can't believe
you are even considering this!

21:59.568 --> 22:01.611
It merits consideration.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.574
Well, if it isn't
the Great One himself.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.908
Artemis Crock.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.663
I understand... even respect
your skepticism.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.290
But you have my word.

22:13.373 --> 22:17.753
If these two choose to stay,
we will strive to help them.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.506
And as a friend of yours
is fond of saying,

22:21.590 --> 22:23.550
"Ra's al Ghul
is many things..."

22:23.633 --> 22:26.470
"...But a liar
isn't one of them."

22:27.929 --> 22:30.140
Jade, what's the end game here?

22:30.223 --> 22:33.769
Are you just trading
one kind of cage for another?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.645
I don't know, Mouse.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.064
But this honestly feels

22:37.147 --> 22:39.107
like a step
in the right direction.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.567
Doesn't it?

22:40.650 --> 22:43.904
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

22:43.987 --> 22:45.113
It does.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.366
For me, too. I wanna stay.

22:48.450 --> 22:52.037
You are both welcome
among our family.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.914
Our true family.

22:53.997 --> 22:57.167
I plan on coming back
to check on both of them.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.335
Count on it.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.045
We have no objection.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.672
You are welcome here
at any time.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.801
You count on it too.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.969
You're not getting away from me
that easy.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.722
I think
for the first time ever...

23:11.681 --> 23:13.892
I'm glad of that.

24:06.903 --> 24:11.741
<i>Maya Angelou,</i> I Know Why
The Caged Bird Sings.
