00:32.698 --> 00:35.326
<i>I never knew Hannah Baker.</i>

00:35.660 --> 00:36.661
<i>I wasn't around.</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:38.872
<i>I didn't know the story.</i>

00:39.831 --> 00:43.835
<i>But it seems to me like if anyone would
have a reason to want Bryce Walker dead,</i>

00:44.919 --> 00:46.129
<i>it would be her mother.</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:51.426
And you might have looked more closely
at her.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.845
if you hadn't had all your eyes
on Clay Jensen.

00:54.971 --> 00:58.011
Thank you very much for coming
back to town. It's very kind of you.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.436
I don't think kindness had anything
to do with it. I believe I was instructed.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.522
Yes, well,
we just have a few more questions.

01:06.107 --> 01:09.319
Some new information has come our way
since we last spoke, and...

01:09.652 --> 01:12.405
we'd just like to clarify a few things.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.239
All right.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.325
All right.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.828
Now, we last spoke on November 7th.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.914
That's the day after Bryce Walker's body

01:21.206 --> 01:22.206
was found.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.291
Yes, I remember.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.686
You told us you were in town
for the closing of your house.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.795
That's correct.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.255
But we checked the courthouse records.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.549
Your house closed on the 31st.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.178
But you stayed in town
into the next week.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.138
Over that weekend, Bryce went missing.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.974
I'm sorry, is there a question
you'd like to ask, Sheriff?

01:40.058 --> 01:42.435
- Why lie to us about these dates?
- I didn't.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.979
I came in to close on the house

01:45.063 --> 01:47.857
and I stayed to deal with furniture
and my storage unit.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.692
Did you happen to see anyone?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.946
- Like who?
- Who did you see?

01:54.572 --> 01:55.572
Well,

01:56.491 --> 01:59.244
I saw my ex-husband
more than I'd like to.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.955
Ah, I saw some friends.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.582
- Clay Jensen?
- No.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.043
I didn't see Clay Jensen.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.088
- But the two of you spoke on the phone?
- No.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.886
Clay's phone records show
three calls from you

02:16.970 --> 02:19.848
the day before the Homecoming game
and one the night of.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.391
He didn't answer.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.726
The night of the Homecoming game...

02:24.853 --> 02:26.855
the night Bryce Walker was murdered...

02:28.439 --> 02:29.774
there's a call from you

02:30.066 --> 02:32.569
that lasted one minute and 47 seconds.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.780
- So, it seems like he did answer.
- He didn't.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.324
I left a message,

02:38.741 --> 02:39.741
but...

02:40.285 --> 02:42.370
you would know that
if you had his phone.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.208
Well, we don't at the moment,
just his phone records.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.334
Well, then.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.047
And I have some questions for you,
actually.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.593
Did you know that this department has
put more investigative efforts

02:56.676 --> 03:00.138
into solving the murder
of a convicted rapist

03:00.346 --> 03:03.057
than it ever did
for any of his former victims?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.393
- I'm sure that is not correct.
- And did you also know

03:05.476 --> 03:08.730
that one of those victims
had to come down here twice

03:08.897 --> 03:12.400
before anyone in this building
would even believe her?

03:12.817 --> 03:13.985
I did know that, yes.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.654
So maybe you can understand
why I might have difficulty

03:16.738 --> 03:20.366
trusting your operation,
or any police in general these days,

03:20.450 --> 03:22.327
Sheriff, because I can't help but wonder

03:22.410 --> 03:25.413
if all this added muscle all of a sudden

03:25.496 --> 03:29.334
might have something to do
with the family that rapist was born into.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.044
Ma'am, I can assure you

03:31.461 --> 03:33.713
that we are only interested
in one thing here,

03:33.963 --> 03:35.048
and that's the truth.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.341
A boy is dead.

03:36.674 --> 03:40.803
And I imagine
only his mother is mourning for him.

03:43.681 --> 03:44.681
So...

03:46.935 --> 03:49.103
- if we're done here?
- Not quite, ma'am.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.687
Where were you

03:51.231 --> 03:52.982
on the night of Friday November 2nd

03:53.858 --> 03:55.860
between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m?

03:59.822 --> 04:02.075
Of course that's the picture they use?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.744
Yeah, dude, that is not your best look.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.540
You're not looking too good right now,
either. Did you sleep at all?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.333
Yeah.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.585
The nightmares again?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.836
Not again,

04:14.128 --> 04:15.128
they never stopped.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.966
Shouldn't you be talking to someone?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.259
Shouldn't you?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.301
Yeah.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.096
Who do I talk to?

04:23.888 --> 04:26.599
What do I say,
"I didn't kill Bryce. I'm not crazy?"

04:27.058 --> 04:30.853
I feel like that actually makes me sound
like a crazy person who killed Bryce.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.649
Mrs. Baker?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.194
Sorry. Is she back in town?

04:39.195 --> 04:40.195
What?

04:48.204 --> 04:50.540
<i>Clay didn't tell Justin
that it wasn't the first time</i>

04:50.623 --> 04:52.208
<i>he'd heard from Mrs. Baker.</i>

04:53.501 --> 04:55.336
He knew exactly why she was in town.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.214
He just didn't know everything she'd done.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.467
She never reached out to you,
texted you, anything?

05:01.676 --> 05:02.676
No.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.985
And you don't think that's weird?
That she didn't reach out to you?

05:07.056 --> 05:08.725
Maybe she's not staying for long.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.313
She was here two weeks ago
and she's back now.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.860
- I can't believe she didn't reach out.
- Well, she didn't, okay?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.490
<i>Yeah, she texted me.</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:28.745
Said she wanted to check in
and see how I was doing, or whatever.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.789
And how is she doing?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
Fine, I guess.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.753
Did she mention me at all?

05:37.086 --> 05:38.086
A little bit.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.465
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.800
She asked how you were doing.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.635
Did she ask about Bryce?

05:44.886 --> 05:47.305
She very specifically
did not mention Bryce,

05:47.388 --> 05:49.182
and I very much appreciated that.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.726
Uh...

05:53.519 --> 05:54.771
what did you talk about?

05:57.815 --> 05:59.108
Well, a lot of things.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.032
I like your look.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.159
- It's new.
- Oh, it is?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.535
Yeah.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.704
It's very tough. Bad-ass.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.207
You look like a warrior.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.920
Do you remember when Hannah used
to wear that green army jacket everywhere?

06:19.003 --> 06:22.090
I used to tease her. I'd ask her,
"What war are you fighting?"

06:23.966 --> 06:24.967
Then I found out.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.721
Yeah, well, if it helps,
I'm still fighting.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.474
It really does.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.020
Yeah, well, it turns out
this whole "toppling the patriarchy" thing

06:36.104 --> 06:37.980
is, em, totally hard.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.607
Yeah, well,

06:39.690 --> 06:42.985
you only have all of history ever
working against you.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.069
True.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.074
Sometimes I feel like
I'm making a real difference, you know?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.077
And other times I just feel like

06:51.869 --> 06:55.706
- nothing has changed at all.
- Yeah, but you've changed.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.835
And you did it all right here.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.505
More than I can say for myself.
I had to get the hell out of here.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.968
I wouldn't have blamed you

07:07.051 --> 07:08.344
if you did, too.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.638
Is it better?

07:12.682 --> 07:13.682
In New York?

07:14.392 --> 07:15.393
It's different.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.062
I mean, sometimes I'll find myself

07:18.146 --> 07:21.858
swept up entirely in this sea of people,

07:21.941 --> 07:25.528
this... this thing that's bigger than me.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.405
In those moments,

07:27.488 --> 07:30.908
I find that I have completely forgotten
who I am

07:31.826 --> 07:32.910
and what happened.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.831
Other times, no matter how many
thousands of miles away I am,

07:36.914 --> 07:37.957
I'm still here.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.751
Right back here.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.505
Why are you back here?

07:45.756 --> 07:47.175
Oh, um...

07:47.925 --> 07:50.261
the old house,
we finally found a buyer for it.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.179
Oh?

07:51.345 --> 07:52.345
Yeah.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.349
It's not easy selling a house
with that kind of...

07:57.059 --> 07:58.394
history, you know?

07:58.603 --> 08:01.564
But we closed on it last week, and, um...

08:01.898 --> 08:03.733
so I'm here, signing paperwork,

08:04.025 --> 08:06.986
clearing things out, you know,
taking care of some other...

08:07.737 --> 08:08.905
unfinished business.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.407
Well, you seem great.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.037
I'm not over it, though.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.039
You know...

08:20.958 --> 08:24.587
I had myself convinced that I was,
that it had gone away, but being...

08:27.840 --> 08:28.841
...being back here...

08:30.468 --> 08:31.594
selling that house...

08:33.554 --> 08:34.554
I'm still sad.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.933
God, I'm still so fucking angry.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.897
But you know,
I prayed that it was different for you.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.566
Is it different? Is it...

08:47.276 --> 08:48.319
Has it gone away?

08:53.157 --> 08:54.157
No.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.955
Did she say what other business?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.374
She didn't, and I didn't ask.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.003
- And what did she say about me?
- She just asked if you were okay.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.507
You could just reach out to her, you know?

09:09.799 --> 09:10.799
Yeah.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.593
I'm seeing her soon.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.805
Oh, then why don't you just, like,
ask her yourself?

09:17.348 --> 09:18.348
Yeah.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.146
Uh, will you tell Justin
that I'll be home late tonight?

09:27.191 --> 09:28.192
We're not talking.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.610
We broke up.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.404
What?

09:33.072 --> 09:35.199
He said that he cheated on me,

09:35.449 --> 09:37.827
which... I don't believe.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.455
And that he's better off without me,
which I don't get.

09:43.833 --> 09:44.834
Oh...

09:46.711 --> 09:47.711
shit!

09:54.135 --> 09:55.886
There's something you need to know.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.937
Did you read <i>The Register?</i>

10:05.354 --> 10:06.981
Yeah, I think everybody has.

10:09.900 --> 10:10.900
Well...

10:11.235 --> 10:12.236
what did you think?

10:13.362 --> 10:16.532
Because first they said that Bryce
was shot, then they said he was beaten.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.535
Now they're looking at Clay,
who must be freaking out about all this.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.494
Yeah.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.958
If he's...

10:27.376 --> 10:30.129
like, guilty,
that'd be pretty messed up, but...

10:31.464 --> 10:32.882
I mean, if he's innocent...

10:34.425 --> 10:36.636
that would be, like, even more messed up.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.470
Right?

10:39.013 --> 10:40.013
Yeah, it would.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.725
What does your dad think?

10:42.808 --> 10:43.809
He doesn't tell me.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.021
Yeah, right. I mean, he probably can't.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.360
Oh, I'm doing some extra sets
after practice today.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.819
Do you want to work out together?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.322
No, it's all right.
I mostly work out at Caleb's now.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.367
Oh, right, yeah. Cool.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.957
I'm interested to know
what you're thinking about your future.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.418
What future?

11:10.961 --> 11:11.962
After high school.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.759
Go full time with my dad.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.304
- That's what you're hoping to do?
- Hoping has nothing to do with it.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.223
Why are we talking about this?

11:22.306 --> 11:24.600
As of right now,
you're failing three classes.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.520
- Okay.
- You're not surprised.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.271
I'm surprised it's not four.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.833
By district policy,
you won't be able to play football...

11:31.857 --> 11:33.734
Yeah, well,
season's basically over anyway.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.278
...or wrestle,
and if you're on academic probation,

11:36.362 --> 11:38.042
you won't be able to play baseball either.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.073
Why do you care?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.825
Are you a baseball fan?

11:40.950 --> 11:43.828
I care
because I think you could be doing better.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.499
How the hell would you know?
You just got here.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.585
I've seen your test scores.
I've talked to your coaches.

11:51.919 --> 11:56.048
J.J. Kerba says you’re one of the smartest
defensive backs he’s ever coached.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.551
He said that?

11:59.885 --> 12:02.638
He also tells me
you were close to Bryce Walker.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.349
Is that true?

12:08.477 --> 12:09.477
Maybe.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.104
So?

12:11.814 --> 12:12.814
So...

12:14.066 --> 12:16.360
his murder must've been
terribly upsetting.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.320
So?

12:19.780 --> 12:20.614
So...

12:20.698 --> 12:22.324
would you like to talk about it?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.537
No.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.457
But thanks for caring.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.586
<i>And Clay wasn't the only one
feeling the attention.</i>

12:35.546 --> 12:36.922
<i>Feeling the pressure build.</i>

12:40.926 --> 12:43.053
<i>Feeling the weight of suspicion,</i>

12:43.971 --> 12:45.681
<i>and the world closing in.</i>

12:47.808 --> 12:48.808
Mrs. Baker.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.353
Clay.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.064
Hello.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.192
Hello.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.870
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.752
How have you been?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.088
I've been better.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.715
I imagine.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.053
You spoke to the police?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.012
Yes.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.390
They wanted to talk about me?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.018
Well, first they wanted to talk about me.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.564
Mostly they wanted to know if...
I'd been talking to you.

13:36.857 --> 13:40.361
I told them I hadn't, because
you hadn't returned any of my phone calls.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.239
Yeah, uh...

13:45.407 --> 13:46.408
I know, I'm sorry.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.577
I've been... kind of busy.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.207
They know about my voicemail.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.545
But apparently, not what it says.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.047
They have my phone records.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.675
But not your phone?

14:06.470 --> 14:09.765
They're convinced that you had something
to do with Bryce's death.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.391
I know.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.251
And they think I might have had
something to do with it, too.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.439
And if they hear that voicemail,
that might convince them I did.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.358
I won't tell them.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.653
I'd understand if you did.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.655
Listen to me, Clay.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.158
They're idiots,
but they're dangerous idiots.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.661
They're convinced you did this,

14:31.287 --> 14:32.788
but if they don't have you,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.623
then it's going to be someone else.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.208
- I mean...
- Clay.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.461
We're talking about murder here.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.089
This is not the time to save your friends.
This is the time...

14:43.674 --> 14:44.925
to save yourself.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.595
I tried.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.098
I'm trying.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.935
Do you know about Tony's family?

14:56.854 --> 14:58.814
That they were deported? Yeah.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.983
But do you know why?

15:02.818 --> 15:03.944
No, uh...

15:04.820 --> 15:05.820
Do you?

15:07.406 --> 15:10.126
<i>- And your family?
- They're back home in Mexico.</i>

15:11.869 --> 15:14.496
I keep asking them what happened.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.332
I wanna know why,

15:16.874 --> 15:17.874
you know?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.377
But the lawyers say

15:20.961 --> 15:22.463
it only takes one phone call.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.589
So...

15:29.929 --> 15:30.930
Oh, shit.

15:31.013 --> 15:34.391
Olivia, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to unload all of this on you.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.436
You're back, so we should be celebrating.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.689
You want a beer for old times' sake?

15:44.234 --> 15:45.234
Tony...

15:48.781 --> 15:51.659
I think I know who made that phone call.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.914
What are you talking about?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.917
Your family, they were picked up
right after the trial, right?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.001
Yeah. Why?

16:01.168 --> 16:05.339
Well, I mean, attorneys from both sides
dug up stuff on the witnesses.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.341
And I remember when Dennis told me...

16:08.258 --> 16:12.221
that the Walkers discovered
your family's status.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.560
At first I was worried
they'd use it against you

16:14.598 --> 16:16.518
when you were on the stand,
but then they didn't.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.310
And I just assumed that they let it go.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.062
Olivia, what are you saying?

16:20.145 --> 16:21.145
That...

16:21.480 --> 16:23.065
their lawyers tipped off ICE?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.944
The lawyer,
or they have private investigators.

16:27.027 --> 16:31.115
It could have even been the Walker family
if they were upset about Bryce's arrest.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.867
Fucking... Bryce.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.828
Tony...

16:37.037 --> 16:38.747
Tony, I am so sorry. I...

16:44.962 --> 16:46.338
Fucking Bryce!

16:55.389 --> 16:56.724
Tony never told me.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.018
Can you imagine why?

17:01.270 --> 17:04.565
He wouldn't have done anything.
He wouldn't have confronted Bryce.

17:05.858 --> 17:11.530
I love Tony as much as you do, Clay,
but his family was ripped away from him.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.159
What am I supposed to do with this?

17:16.492 --> 17:17.536
Talk to your friend.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.503
You did see Mrs. Baker.
You saw her more than once.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.298
And she told me about the Walkers.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.633
- What about the Walkers?
- How it was their fault.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.155
That's why you didn't tell me, right?
It makes you look guilty.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.514
- No, it's not that.
- Then why wouldn't you tell me?

17:37.598 --> 17:38.766
It's complicated.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.517
But you did keep it a secret?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.269
- I did.
- Why?

17:43.687 --> 17:46.247
All I can tell you is that I'm trying
to protect my family, Clay.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.529
Do the cops know?
About the Walkers and your family?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.239
They don't.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.660
Did you go to Bryce with it?

18:01.830 --> 18:02.830
I did.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.223
Tony?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.226
What's up, Bryce?

18:22.434 --> 18:25.354
Ah, I wouldn't be lurking out here.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.523
Grandpa's got a gun.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.485
And he's racist and senile. So...

18:31.652 --> 18:33.612
You weren't doing me a favor, were you?

18:34.863 --> 18:37.157
- Sorry?
- Buying my Mustang.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.118
At twice the asking.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.455
You know, for a minute,
I thought you were doing me a solid.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.958
That was pretty stupid, wasn't it?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.501
No, I mean,

18:47.584 --> 18:49.795
- I just wanted to help out.
- You wanted...

18:50.504 --> 18:52.798
to buy your way out
of a guilty conscience.

18:53.340 --> 18:56.093
- And what was I feeling guilty about?
- The trial.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.471
What does that have to do with you?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.474
Your family dug up dirt on mine,

19:03.183 --> 19:04.226
and turned us in.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
What?

19:08.856 --> 19:09.982
That's crazy.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.235
They deported my whole fucking family.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.324
That's impossible. That's not...
Tony, I swear, there's no way.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.742
Why should I believe you?

19:22.995 --> 19:26.999
I don't know what to say, but I'm sure
we didn't have anything to do with it.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.751
And I'm... I'm so sorry.

19:30.878 --> 19:31.879
You're sorry?

19:35.841 --> 19:36.841
Fuck you!

19:38.302 --> 19:39.303
Bryce?

19:39.970 --> 19:40.971
Is that you?

19:49.938 --> 19:50.938
Fuck.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.862
Whatever the fuck you want,
I don't have time.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.377
You were right.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.213
About ICE.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.593
I asked my mom about it.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.511
My dad gave them up.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.223
Why the fuck would he do that?

20:25.015 --> 20:27.100
I testified for the school,
for fuck's sake.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.310
For your side!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.562
I think he was just pissed at everybody.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.190
The trial fucked with our family,

20:33.273 --> 20:34.650
with his reputation.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.278
He wanted to make
as many people pay as possible.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.573
On both sides. But I didn't know.
I swear to you I didn't know.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.033
Well, that's so comforting.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.538
Look, I am really fucking sorry, man.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.208
And, uh...

20:53.293 --> 20:54.293
here.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.006
What the fuck is this?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.216
Like I said,

21:00.801 --> 21:03.428
you without your sweet red ride
is a tragedy.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.974
No, Bryce.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.686
I lost my entire fucking family.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.438
That's the tragedy.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.360
You're right, man. I'm...
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.443
How does a car

21:19.486 --> 21:22.072
- fix what your dad did? How?
- I didn't know.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.492
Yeah, you said that already, like
it's supposed to fucking matter to me.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.911
The fact is, all of this bullshit

21:28.287 --> 21:31.623
is a chain reaction that started with you!

21:32.791 --> 21:36.211
Would there have been a trial
if Hannah hadn't killed herself?

21:37.421 --> 21:40.674
Would Hannah be dead
if you hadn't raped her?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.721
You've ruined so many fucking lives.

21:45.804 --> 21:50.475
And still, even now,
you act like it's somebody else's fault.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.352
Bryce,

21:53.770 --> 21:54.770
look at me.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.690
It's your fault.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.860
Take some fucking responsibility.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.410
I think about Hannah every day.

22:10.912 --> 22:11.912
Yeah?

22:12.831 --> 22:14.583
What exactly do you think about?

22:18.754 --> 22:19.754
Regret...

22:22.090 --> 22:23.091
for hurting her.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.094
God.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.599
Have you even listened to her tapes?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.685
- I never got the tapes.
- They were on the fucking internet.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.229
- Yeah, but they took them down.
- After two months!

22:38.231 --> 22:39.566
No, I never listened.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.196
Then you don't have any fucking idea
how you hurt her.

22:48.992 --> 22:49.992
Keep the car.

22:53.830 --> 22:54.956
Do you still have 'em?

22:56.166 --> 22:57.166
The tapes?

22:59.586 --> 23:00.587
I have copies.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.341
I'll listen.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.805
That's so gracious of you. Please,
don't do it on my fucking account.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.848
No, I... I want to listen.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.601
I need to.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.383
Not Hannah.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.847
Maybe no one should be.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.104
So, what... what the fuck do I do now?

26:48.148 --> 26:49.357
You deal with your shit.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.237
Just like that?

26:55.196 --> 26:56.948
Just deal with my shit, that's it?

26:58.033 --> 26:59.033
Bryce...

27:01.745 --> 27:03.038
Bryce, that's everything.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.470
Do you, um...

27:20.472 --> 27:22.432
Do you ever talk to Mrs. Baker anymore?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.732
- I saw her the other day.
- She's in town?

27:34.903 --> 27:37.947
Could you... could you maybe
get me in touch with her?

27:44.704 --> 27:46.456
Shit, man. I don't know, I...

27:47.540 --> 27:48.541
I don't know.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.801
<i>I had dinner
with Andy last night.</i>

28:00.553 --> 28:03.098
We signed the final escrow documents
for the house.

28:03.723 --> 28:04.723
How is he?

28:06.601 --> 28:07.601
Married.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.813
As of last month.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.691
- To the woman with the little girl?
- Mmm.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.737
I moved to New York and tried to...

28:18.446 --> 28:20.615
live the life
that Hannah always dreamed of,

28:20.699 --> 28:21.699
and he...

28:22.158 --> 28:25.078
He recreated the family we lost
as soon as he could.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.915
I mean, it's not gonna be the same.
It can't be.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.000
Well, he knows that, but...

28:32.419 --> 28:36.464
he needs to be a husband and father.
He doesn't know who he is otherwise.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.427
I, uh...

28:43.430 --> 28:45.140
I saw Bryce Walker the other day.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.560
He didn't try to talk to you, did he?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.355
No. No, of course not, but...

28:53.690 --> 28:56.025
it made me think
about what I might say to him.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.321
I have nothing to say to him.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.197
Nothing.

29:03.324 --> 29:06.828
Nothing will ever change what he did
or erase it. I'll always hate him.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.165
And not just for what he did to Han...

29:12.834 --> 29:14.169
But then for getting up...

29:15.211 --> 29:18.590
on that stand and making up all those lies
about her and everyone else

29:18.673 --> 29:20.258
just to save himself? No.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.053
My little girl is gone.

29:25.388 --> 29:30.477
And Bryce Walker gets
to just live out the rest of his life? No.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.605
I pray I don't run into him,

29:33.688 --> 29:35.774
'cause honestly,
I'm afraid of what I'd do.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.406
A week later...

29:46.367 --> 29:47.911
A week later, Bryce was dead.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.332
- Did you see Mrs. Baker again after that?
- No, not since then.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.918
I did see Bryce once more.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.712
- What did you tell him?
- To steer clear of Mrs. Baker.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.465
That she wasn't in a place
to hear his apology.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.383
He was... he was disappointed.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.677
Do you think he listened?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.095
I hope he did.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.936
You knew all this
when the police picked me up?

30:08.973 --> 30:11.309
You knew Mrs. Baker was in town
when you asked.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.355
I hate what's happening.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.358
No one can trust anyone.
We're supposed to be friends!

30:18.441 --> 30:20.235
I am your friend, Clay.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.279
I am your friend.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.698
I have a family to take care of.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.284
Right.

30:29.619 --> 30:30.619
Got it.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.748
Clay! Come on,
you gotta give me some time-<i>-</i>

30:33.832 --> 30:36.793
Where were you that night, Tony?
After the Homecoming game?

30:37.627 --> 30:39.128
I was with Caleb the whole night.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.755
With your boyfriend? Who loves you?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.882
- Who would do anything for you?
- Yes, correct.

30:43.925 --> 30:44.926
Where were you?

30:49.639 --> 30:50.640
I was all alone.

30:56.938 --> 31:01.234
<i>♪ Ain't love or sport

31:02.360 --> 31:04.779

31:05.947 --> 31:09.659
<i>♪ No, you're not alone ♪</i>

31:13.496 --> 31:15.039
Jess, what are you doing here?

31:15.456 --> 31:18.167
I came to tell you
that I reject your break-up request.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.253
Uh... I...

31:21.004 --> 31:23.172
- I cheated on you.
- No, you didn't.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.217
- Yes, I did.
- Clay told me about what he found out.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.389
Fucking Clay!

31:31.472 --> 31:34.851
Yeah, fucking Clay, who cares about you
and won't give up on you.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.101
And neither will I.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.231
- I'm not gonna let you just push me away.
- Why?

31:40.815 --> 31:41.858
I've lied to you.

31:41.941 --> 31:44.381
I'm just gonna let you down,
just like I've let everyone down,

31:44.444 --> 31:45.653
- always.
- Stop!

31:46.654 --> 31:47.654
I love you.

31:48.489 --> 31:52.452
And if you're in any kind of trouble,
I want to help you get through it, okay?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.331
- You're better off without me.
- Okay.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.209
Then look at me
and tell me that you don't love me.

32:08.551 --> 32:09.552
You know I do.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.348
You know I love you.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.187
I just feel like I'm going down this...

32:21.314 --> 32:25.068
this dark hole, and I can't figure out
how to get out of it.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.739
I don't want to bring you down there
with me.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.410

32:56.557 --> 32:57.557
the hardest thing,

32:58.476 --> 32:59.476
isn't it?

33:01.437 --> 33:03.106
Can someone trust a lover?

33:04.315 --> 33:05.358
A friend?

33:06.025 --> 33:07.025
A brother?

33:08.820 --> 33:09.821
Can you trust me?

33:11.906 --> 33:12.906
<i>So,</i>

33:13.282 --> 33:14.367
<i>I talked to Tony.</i>

33:15.743 --> 33:17.245
Did Bryce come to see you?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.623
Before you left that message?

33:23.418 --> 33:24.669
Why would you think that?

33:27.588 --> 33:29.173
Tony played him the tapes.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.801
He'd never heard them.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.137
And I guess they...

33:35.763 --> 33:36.931
had an impact.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.560
I can imagine.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.355
Yes.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.776
He came to see me.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.498
Mrs. Baker?

34:06.961 --> 34:08.629
What the hell are you doing here?

34:08.795 --> 34:11.065
Please, I'm not trying to upset you.
I just want to talk...

34:11.090 --> 34:13.926
How dare you? You stay away from me.
I will call the police.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.847
I listened to the tapes.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.811
To Hannah's tapes. I just...
I'd really like to speak with you.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.895
Not interested.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.315
I understand the pain that I caused.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.650
You never could understand that.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.820
You're right, but I'm trying to.
I'm trying to understand.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.156
- Please help me to.
- Oh, I'm not here to help you!

34:36.699 --> 34:40.078
What? I will not be a part of this...
Your penance,

34:40.536 --> 34:42.246
or absolution, or whatever...

34:44.665 --> 34:46.501
What you did to my daughter...

34:48.293 --> 34:49.295
You broke her.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.672
Do you understand that?

34:54.217 --> 34:55.927
- I do.
- No, you don't.

34:56.219 --> 35:00.139
You wanted something and you took it,
because you felt entitled.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.476
You felt it was your right...

35:03.935 --> 35:05.228
to rape my daughter.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.356
And you have blood on your hands
and you always will.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.902
I'm sorry.

35:14.987 --> 35:17.949
I wish you a lifetime
of learning what "sorry" means.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.791
Did anyone see you speak with him?

35:29.377 --> 35:31.254
Some of the staff may have seen me.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.342
And what if the police find out?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.302
Then they find out.

35:38.886 --> 35:42.723
I'm not asking you to keep any secrets
for me, Clay. I would never do that.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.060
I'm not gonna save myself
by selling out other people.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.104
Who I care about.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.314
You're a loyal person.

35:50.898 --> 35:54.193
I think you were the one kid in the world
my daughter could trust.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.863
For all the good it did her.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.532
I believe it did her a great deal of good.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.493
But she was...

36:04.328 --> 36:05.328
overwhelmed.

36:07.331 --> 36:11.210
She lost sight
of the most important instinct.

36:12.587 --> 36:13.587
Survival.

36:16.799 --> 36:17.799
Clay,

36:18.759 --> 36:19.802
survive this.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.353
Now, I'm afraid I've got a plane to catch.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.361
- Thank you for... for seeing me again.
- Yeah.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.450
Take care of yourself, okay?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.080
Mrs. Baker.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.169
You never asked me

36:53.961 --> 36:55.546
if I did it.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.132
You never asked me.

37:01.677 --> 37:04.388
You know what was on
that voicemail message, don't you?

37:06.140 --> 37:07.140
So do I.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.978
<i>Everyone needs someone to trust.</i>

37:11.687 --> 37:13.564
<i>Clay decided he could trust me again.</i>

37:14.148 --> 37:15.149
<i>And I, him.</i>

37:16.275 --> 37:17.568
<i>Clay,</i>

37:17.652 --> 37:19.070
<i>I wish you'd ring me back.</i>

37:19.737 --> 37:21.822
<i>I'm at the cemetery, at Hannah's grave.</i>

37:22.240 --> 37:25.076
<i>And to be honest, I've been drinking.</i>

37:26.369 --> 37:29.789
I read in the newspaper
that Bryce Walker's playing at Liberty.

37:30.998 --> 37:31.998
Tonight.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.670
The reporter called it his...

37:35.753 --> 37:36.754
"Homecoming."

37:39.423 --> 37:40.675
His fucking Homecoming!

37:43.386 --> 37:44.553
He gets to come home.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.641
And my little girl's dead.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.232
<i>I wanna fucking kill him.</i>

37:57.024 --> 37:58.693
<i>I wanna fucking kill him.</i>

37:58.776 --> 38:02.405
<i>I want to take a gun
and load it and shoot him</i>

38:03.281 --> 38:04.281
<i>in the head.</i>

38:06.867 --> 38:09.245
And it goes on like that
for a little while longer.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.789
You... you didn't tell the police?

38:12.456 --> 38:13.958
I don't think she did anything.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.877
I think she was drunk and sad.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.879
She wanted to kill him!

38:19.964 --> 38:20.964
So did I!

38:21.340 --> 38:24.552
But then they found my fingerprints
on his car and not hers, so...

38:27.888 --> 38:30.725
You never told me
why you came to the house that night.

38:33.769 --> 38:35.688
The night you threatened Bryce.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.735
I was there to see you.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.490
<i>Betty, will you go to Homecoming
with me?</i>

38:48.200 --> 38:49.200
Yes!

38:55.291 --> 38:58.502
- I hate this time of year.
- What, you don't believe in romance?

38:59.503 --> 39:02.214
I don't believe in over-the-top theatrics
designed specifically

39:02.298 --> 39:04.133
to maximize likes on social media.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.305
Okay, yeah. The public display of it
is all a bit crass, but...

39:10.431 --> 39:12.600
I do see the appeal of a public gesture.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.813
Wait, are you taking
the pro-romance position?

39:18.898 --> 39:19.899
Is that shocking?

39:20.983 --> 39:24.195
Yes, it absolutely is.
You're completely anti-romance.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.279
You have rules.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.531
I'm not completely anti-romance.

39:28.407 --> 39:31.410
You refused to teach me "I love you"
in Swahili

39:31.494 --> 39:33.621
because you were afraid
I'd use it against you.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.957
Okay, well, it was more
the linguistic tourism that I objected to.

39:39.668 --> 39:43.881
And high school dances are not romantic,
they're institutionalized anxiety.

39:45.549 --> 39:48.511
I have a very bad history
with high school dances.

39:50.679 --> 39:54.058
To be fair, I've never been to one,
so I wouldn't really know.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.646
Wait. Like, ever?

40:00.189 --> 40:03.484
Five schools, three years, no dances.

40:05.277 --> 40:08.280
Anyway, my mother thinks
they're, like, wildly inappropriate.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.662
I'm sure you've...
I'm sure you've been asked before?

40:15.579 --> 40:16.579
I never have.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.460
Because you're blatantly anti-romantic.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.131
Fine. Yeah, we'll leave it at that.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.267
"Naku penda?"

40:37.017 --> 40:38.602
"I love you" in Swahili.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.790
Hey, Jensen.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.918
I see you made it
all the way up the hill this time.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.504
- Shut up!
- Buddy.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.258
You're not just gonna go
knock on the door with those, are you?

41:09.550 --> 41:10.801
Ani's mom will freak.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.890
Ani's mom's at some church thing tonight,
okay? So, back off!

41:15.973 --> 41:18.934
You don't think she's gonna hear about
some boy showing up on her doorstep,

41:19.018 --> 41:20.227
talking to her daughter?

41:21.187 --> 41:22.563
Who would she hear that from?

41:22.646 --> 41:24.773
Wait, this isn't a Homecoming ask, is it?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.653
- No.
- Oh...

41:30.279 --> 41:31.530
that's so romantic.

41:32.573 --> 41:35.034
But you know Ani's not really
a romance girl?

41:35.367 --> 41:37.119
- How would you know?
- Dude.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.790
You do know she's not some, like,
sweet, innocent girl, right?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.667
She's lived a life.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.671
She's not the Evergreen good girl
like what you go for.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.090
- You don't know anything about her.
- I live with her.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.175
Of course I do.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.636
You don't fucking know anything!

41:56.180 --> 41:57.806
Can I get out of my car, please?

42:06.732 --> 42:08.275
You better stay away from her.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.279
How am I supposed to stay away
from her? I live here.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.490
- If you touch her...
- What?

42:15.074 --> 42:17.409
I wouldn't do anything to Ani,
she's my friend.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.163
If you touch her...

42:22.581 --> 42:23.958
if you even look at her...

42:25.084 --> 42:26.126
I will kill you.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.588
I'm off my probation.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.884
But I still don't think it's a good idea
to beat the shit out of you.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.387
However, that doesn't mean
I can't fuck your friend.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.805
I will fucking kill you!

42:38.389 --> 42:39.515
Don't worry about me.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.935
Go ask your friend to the dance.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.199
Goddammit!

43:14.967 --> 43:16.051
You never told me.

43:19.763 --> 43:21.682
Well, I never should've gone up there.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.934
The whole thing was a ridiculous idea.

43:24.018 --> 43:27.146
Asking me to Homecoming
was a ridiculous idea?

43:28.105 --> 43:29.690
I just thought it might be fun.

43:32.276 --> 43:35.362
But Bryce was right, your mom
never would've let it happen anyway.

43:37.323 --> 43:38.323
Who knows?

43:39.908 --> 43:42.369
Maybe your grand gesture
would have won her over.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.123
Or maybe I could've just snuck out.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.709
Wait, seriously?

43:52.671 --> 43:53.964
I guess we'll never know.

44:15.527 --> 44:18.530
You know, you shouldn't let my mom
get free labor out of you.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.617
There are laws against that.

44:21.700 --> 44:22.785
I offered to help.

44:24.828 --> 44:25.828
So,

44:26.121 --> 44:27.456
you and Clay Jensen,

44:28.916 --> 44:29.917
is that a thing now?

44:31.585 --> 44:32.585
No.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.589
Not that it's any of your business.

44:37.549 --> 44:38.592
I miss you.

44:40.761 --> 44:41.929
Look, what happened...

44:43.430 --> 44:45.849
the other night, it can't happen again.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.518
You... you know this.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.311
I need you.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.982
I need to be who I am when I'm with you.

44:55.651 --> 44:56.652
You're changing me.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.488
Please, Ani.

45:00.489 --> 45:02.199
You're the only one I have to talk to.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.076
Bryce, look, you're drunk.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.663
- I have to go.
- Goddammit, Ani, I need you.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.456
- I need you so fucking bad!
- Bryce!

45:09.540 --> 45:10.540
No!

45:11.792 --> 45:14.128
Let go of me! You're scaring me.

45:19.007 --> 45:20.008
Ani, wait.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.014
Fuck!

45:44.533 --> 45:46.285
I'll admit I was, um...

45:48.495 --> 45:50.497
surprised to get your call.

45:52.791 --> 45:53.791
Well.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.673
I remember what it was like
those first...

46:00.299 --> 46:02.259
few weeks after we lost Hannah.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.471
There are no words.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.224
It goes against
the natural order of things

46:09.308 --> 46:11.685
for a parent to bury a child.

46:12.394 --> 46:13.394
Yes.

46:14.271 --> 46:17.858
And after our parenting
was judged by anyone and everyone...

46:20.027 --> 46:21.487
but we did the best we could.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.324
We loved our girl.

46:26.533 --> 46:27.533
I know.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.452
I know you did.

46:32.414 --> 46:33.791
Your son reached out to me.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.251
Before he died, he...

46:37.419 --> 46:39.671
apologized for what he did to Hannah.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.508
I had no idea.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.384
I couldn't forgive him.

46:45.344 --> 46:46.345
I still can't.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.432
But I know he wanted to change.

46:52.351 --> 46:53.351
And that...

46:55.646 --> 46:56.647
gave me hope.

46:58.315 --> 47:01.193
Olivia, I hope you know
how deeply sorry I am.

47:04.696 --> 47:05.697
For everything.

47:08.033 --> 47:09.243
Thank you.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.540
You know...

47:19.294 --> 47:20.294
after...

47:21.171 --> 47:23.215
Hannah died, I didn't know what to do...

47:25.509 --> 47:26.510
with my pain.

47:28.136 --> 47:30.013
I wanted to find someone to blame.

47:31.682 --> 47:32.682
The school,

47:33.517 --> 47:35.310
her classmates, your son.

47:37.563 --> 47:41.483
I thought it would make me
feel better to punish someone else.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.319
To make them hurt...

47:45.445 --> 47:46.445
like I hurt.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.159
What your daughter went through, I...

47:52.703 --> 47:53.829
I can't imagine.

47:56.790 --> 47:58.792
But...

47:59.835 --> 48:02.170
...someone took my son's life.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.131
In cold blood.

48:05.215 --> 48:08.218
- That person should be held responsible.
- Yes.

48:08.594 --> 48:11.388
And the police believe
that they have found that person.

48:11.763 --> 48:13.849
There seems to be evidence.

48:15.726 --> 48:17.477
And he had a strong motive.

48:18.395 --> 48:21.648
But surely you know
he wasn't the only one who did?

48:26.236 --> 48:27.236
Nora,

48:28.030 --> 48:30.991
I truly hope you find the right person,
I do.

48:32.534 --> 48:34.953
And I hope
that gives you some satisfaction.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.665
But I'm afraid I can predict that...

48:40.083 --> 48:41.543
it won't make you hurt less.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.964
And it won't bring your son back.

49:01.730 --> 49:02.731
Where are the folks?

49:03.440 --> 49:04.650
Mom's at work.

49:05.025 --> 49:07.986
Dad's at The Crestmont,
pretending that life isn't happening.

49:08.862 --> 49:09.862
Cool.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.287
So, Jess.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.084
Jess told me you spoke to her.

49:22.542 --> 49:23.542
Oh.

49:24.336 --> 49:25.336
Shit.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.206
Look, I'm sorry. I wasn't...
I was just trying to help.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.717
I thought maybe if she knew
what was going on

49:31.176 --> 49:33.845
- with you, maybe she'd understand.
- You're right.

49:34.471 --> 49:37.766
I couldn't tell her, so I'm...
I'm glad you did.

49:39.851 --> 49:40.851
Okay.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.145
Cool.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.403
So, what...

49:51.113 --> 49:52.447
What are you gonna do now?

49:54.449 --> 49:55.449
I don't know.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.678
Clay Jensen,
we have a warrant to search your property.

50:14.761 --> 50:16.513
What? How is that possible?

50:16.596 --> 50:18.557
Step aside
or you'll be charged with obstruction.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.600
Fuck. Don't say anything!

50:20.684 --> 50:21.852
All right, turn around.

50:21.935 --> 50:23.770
Lock your fingers behind your back.

50:23.854 --> 50:24.855
Spread your legs.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.860
We're gonna need the shoes you're wearing,

50:30.444 --> 50:32.904
along with any electronic devices
you may have.

50:34.197 --> 50:35.240
Is this your cell phone?

50:35.323 --> 50:38.243
I'm gonna reach into your pocket
and get your cell phone.

50:39.494 --> 50:40.787
All right, you can relax.

50:41.997 --> 50:44.624
- Why... why do you need my phone?
- I think you know.
