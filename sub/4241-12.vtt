00:08.800 --> 00:08.800
<i>Brittany out of a cannon, but
it wasn't safe, so Brittany,</i>

00:08.800 --> 00:09.346
<i>Now we get to see what they
look like in street clothes.</i>

00:09.381 --> 00:09.893
<i>Finn broke up with Rachel
because she made out with Puck,</i>

00:09.961 --> 00:11.361
<i>but then Quinn kissed Finn
after the big game,</i>

00:11.429 --> 00:12.996
<i>even though she's been dating
Sam. Yikes!</i>

00:13.064 --> 00:15.732
<i>It used to be a love triangle,
and now it's, like, a Pentagon.</i>

00:15.800 --> 00:17.500
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:19.937 --> 00:22.706
<i>We all know I'm not
the smartest guy in the world,</i>

00:22.773 --> 00:25.008
<i>but there are two lessons
I learned the hard way.</i>

00:25.076 --> 00:26.576
<i>One: never punch a cop.</i>

00:26.644 --> 00:30.146
<i>The other one:
you can't choose love.</i>

00:30.214 --> 00:32.348
<i>Love chooses you.</i>

00:32.415 --> 00:35.785
<i>I mean, I could have any girl
I wanted, but</i>

00:35.853 --> 00:37.754
<i>here I am,
in the middle of geometry</i>

00:37.822 --> 00:39.723
<i>or English or something,</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:42.192
<i>and the only girl
I've got my eye on is</i>

00:42.260 --> 00:43.693
<i>a whole lot of woman.</i>

00:43.761 --> 00:45.695
<i>I owe it all to Sectionals.</i>

00:45.763 --> 00:47.530
<i>We needed a 12th member, and</i>

00:47.598 --> 00:49.866
<i>I told her
if she joined the Glee Club,</i>

00:49.934 --> 00:51.735
<i>I'd give her seven minutes
in heaven.</i>

00:53.971 --> 00:57.908
<i>But what went down in
that janitor's closet was epic.</i>

00:57.975 --> 01:01.044
You're really not good at this,
and you're kind of scrawny.

01:01.112 --> 01:03.847
You got to be kidding me.

01:05.783 --> 01:07.684
Yeah, you're not
turning me on at all.

01:07.752 --> 01:09.653
Later, sad sack.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.388
But that was only three minutes.

01:11.455 --> 01:12.756
Three minutes
I'll never get back.

01:14.992 --> 01:15.825
<i>Maybe it's because
she's constantly</i>

01:15.893 --> 01:17.494
<i>insulting me, like my mom.</i>

01:17.561 --> 01:19.562
<i>Maybe I just dig a chick
with curves,</i>

01:19.630 --> 01:21.464
<i>but it's almost Valentine's
Day, and it's official.</i>

01:21.532 --> 01:24.567
Stare at me again,
and I'll break your nuts.

01:24.635 --> 01:26.536
Also,

01:26.604 --> 01:27.704
these candies you gave me?

01:27.772 --> 01:28.872
They sucked.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.507
But you ate all of them.

01:30.574 --> 01:33.343
I had to make sure
they all sucked.

01:33.411 --> 01:40.417
I'm in love with Lauren Zizes.

01:55.299 --> 01:56.866
I love you, Finny-bear.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.401
Thanks, Becky.

01:58.469 --> 02:00.370
Oh.
Be my Valentine?

02:01.572 --> 02:02.339
Awesome.

02:02.406 --> 02:03.673
I'll keep you posted.

02:03.741 --> 02:05.842
Copy that.

02:05.910 --> 02:08.945
<i>Yeah, I've been collecting
a lot of hearts lately.</i>

02:09.013 --> 02:11.748
<i>Only question is,
which one to choose.</i>

02:11.816 --> 02:13.416
<i>Bingo.</i>

02:13.484 --> 02:16.286
<i>I just need to go for this.</i>

02:16.354 --> 02:18.521
<i>Maybe the reason
it never worked out with Rachel</i>

02:18.589 --> 02:20.423
<i>was because
I was never over Quinn.</i>

02:20.491 --> 02:22.425
<i>I know
I can pry her away from Sam</i>

02:22.493 --> 02:24.427
<i>if I can get her
to kiss me again.</i>

02:24.495 --> 02:26.396
<i>The ridiculous thing is
that I could get every girl</i>

02:26.464 --> 02:28.398
<i>in this school
to kiss me but her.</i>

02:28.466 --> 02:30.333
<i>Game on.</i>

02:33.371 --> 02:35.338
Okay, I'm all for flair,

02:35.406 --> 02:37.774
but these Valentine Day
decorations are just tacky.

02:37.842 --> 02:40.377
I mean, what the hell
is this supposed to be?

02:40.444 --> 02:41.811
It's clearly puppy love.

02:41.879 --> 02:43.613
It's cute. Come on.

02:43.681 --> 02:45.415
Ooh.

02:45.483 --> 02:46.716
I love you!

02:46.784 --> 02:48.018
Oh, this is creepy. Adorable.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.319
It's a simple excuse

02:49.387 --> 02:51.588
to sell candy and greeting
cards on a holiday.

02:51.655 --> 02:53.023
Not true.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.125
People have been celebrating
Valentine's Day for centuries.

02:55.192 --> 02:57.961
And call me a hopeless romantic,
but it's my favorite holiday.

02:58.029 --> 02:59.496
Really?

02:59.563 --> 03:01.731
I think there's something
really great about a day

03:01.799 --> 03:04.601
where you're encouraged
to just lay it all on the line

03:04.668 --> 03:08.138
and say to somebody,
"I'm in love with you. "

03:08.205 --> 03:09.839
You know?

03:09.907 --> 03:12.275
And this year, I want
to do something really radical,

03:12.343 --> 03:14.411
so I need your
opinion on this.

03:14.478 --> 03:17.380
Well, there's this guy
that I sort of... like,

03:17.448 --> 03:19.783
and I've only known him
for a little while,

03:19.850 --> 03:22.185
but I want to tell him
that I think

03:22.253 --> 03:24.754
my feelings are starting
to change into something...

03:24.822 --> 03:27.057
deeper.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.525
So I have to ask.

03:28.592 --> 03:30.160
Do you think it's too much

03:30.227 --> 03:32.062
to sing to somebody
on Valentine's Day?

03:32.129 --> 03:33.997
Not at all.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.634
What can I get you?

03:37.701 --> 03:40.637
Uh, a medium drip, and a grande
nonfat mocha for this guy,

03:40.704 --> 03:43.840
and maybe I can get him to split
one of those Cupid cookies.

03:43.908 --> 03:44.974
You know my
coffee order?

03:45.042 --> 03:47.677
Of course I do.

03:47.745 --> 03:48.878
That'll be $8.40.

03:48.946 --> 03:50.213
Don't even bother, dummy.

03:50.281 --> 03:51.448
It's on me.

03:51.515 --> 03:52.849
Keep the change.

03:55.119 --> 03:57.520
I do believe
I have a new favorite holiday.

03:59.457 --> 04:01.658
All right, guys,
I have one word for you.

04:02.893 --> 04:03.827
Brittany.

04:03.894 --> 04:05.628
Is it "love"?

04:05.696 --> 04:07.030
I'm totally going
to graduate now.

04:07.098 --> 04:08.598
Valentine's Day is coming up,

04:08.666 --> 04:10.266
so for this
week's lesson,

04:10.334 --> 04:12.869
I want you guys
to pick a partner,

04:12.937 --> 04:14.037
because you're going
to sing to them

04:14.105 --> 04:15.538
what you think is the world's

04:15.606 --> 04:16.738
greatest love song.

04:16.807 --> 04:17.974
Yeah, find a song

04:18.041 --> 04:19.576
that communicates

04:19.642 --> 04:21.744
all the things that
love means to you.

04:21.812 --> 04:23.847
Now, partner up. Mr.
Shue, can I say something?

04:25.049 --> 04:26.716
I just wanted to point out that

04:26.784 --> 04:30.286
for the first time, an entire
week has gone by without

04:30.354 --> 04:32.455
any one of us
getting slushied.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.190
I think the fact
that I led the football team

04:34.258 --> 04:35.458
to a Conference Championship

04:35.526 --> 04:37.460
might have something
to do with it.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.995
Fact is that I'm
the closest thing

04:39.063 --> 04:41.197
that this Glee Club has
to a celebrity right now.

04:41.265 --> 04:43.133
And just like a
famous athlete,

04:43.200 --> 04:44.567
I want to give
to a charity.

04:44.635 --> 04:45.735
You guys.

04:47.004 --> 04:49.105
So, I'm setting up
a kissing booth

04:49.173 --> 04:51.007
for a dollar a smooch,
and donating the proceeds

04:51.075 --> 04:52.609
to Glee Club
to help us...

04:52.676 --> 04:54.444
Don't even act like
you're trying to help this

04:54.512 --> 04:56.479
Glee Club out. You just want
to kiss a bunch of girls.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.714
I've kissed Finn,
and can I just say?

04:57.781 --> 04:58.848
Not worth a buck.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.283
I would, however,

05:00.351 --> 05:03.153
pay a hundred dollars
to jiggle one of his man-boobs.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.054
Do you ever get tired
of tearing other people down?

05:05.122 --> 05:06.623
No, not really.
'Cause you always

05:06.690 --> 05:08.758
just seem to do be meddling
in everybody else's business.

05:08.826 --> 05:10.627
Oh, please.
You guys love me.

05:10.694 --> 05:12.562
I keep it real,
and I'm hilarious.

05:12.630 --> 05:14.397
Actually, you're
just a bitch.

05:14.465 --> 05:16.599
Whoa! Okay. I'm sorry. Whoa!

05:16.667 --> 05:18.334
You've just got eyes for my man.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.370
Okay, first of all,
I'm not your man.

05:20.437 --> 05:21.871
And Finn is right.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.173
All you ever
do is insult us.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.774
Three weeks ago, you said

05:24.842 --> 05:26.576
you were disappointed that
I didn't have a lizard baby.

05:26.644 --> 05:28.044
Five minutes ago, you said

05:28.112 --> 05:29.679
Mr. Shue belonged
in a 12-step program.

05:29.747 --> 05:30.847
Wait. What?

05:30.915 --> 05:31.981
You're addicted to vests.

05:32.049 --> 05:33.550
The truth is, Santana,

05:33.617 --> 05:35.318
you can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

05:35.386 --> 05:36.753
Okay, maybe you're right.
Maybe I am destined

05:36.820 --> 05:38.454
to play the title role
in the Broadway

05:38.522 --> 05:40.390
<i>musical version of Willow,
but the only job</i>

05:40.457 --> 05:43.126
you're going to have
is working on a pole.

05:45.029 --> 05:46.663
Fine.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.598
Santana...

05:48.666 --> 05:50.400
Maybe try rocking
back and forth.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.001
People do that in movies.

05:52.069 --> 05:54.237
No. 'Cause I just try

05:54.305 --> 05:57.540
to be really, really
honest with people

05:57.608 --> 06:00.276
when I think that
they suck, you know?

06:00.344 --> 06:02.412
Yeah.
No one gets it

06:06.016 --> 06:07.984
I suppose you want
me to thank you

06:08.052 --> 06:10.420
for sticking up for me today,
except that makes it seem

06:10.487 --> 06:12.355
like I need somebody to
stick up for me, so...

06:12.423 --> 06:13.656
Oh, no, no. Trust me.

06:13.724 --> 06:16.392
I- I know you don't need me
to stick up for you.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.161
I mean, you're all
kinds of tough.

06:18.229 --> 06:19.062
And...
Mm, it's true.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.664
How about you let me take you

06:21.732 --> 06:23.132
to Breadstix
for Valentine's Day?

06:23.200 --> 06:25.735
Do you seriously
think it's that easy?

06:25.803 --> 06:28.304
I'm not desperate, so
if you really want this,

06:28.372 --> 06:30.073
you best come correct.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.743
Because I spell
woman Z-I-Z-E-S,

06:33.811 --> 06:36.713
and I need to be wooed,
you understand me?

06:36.780 --> 06:37.914
Wooed.

06:37.982 --> 06:39.782
Damn.

06:42.951 --> 06:45.086
Hey.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.053
What you doing?

06:46.121 --> 06:47.522
Nothing.

06:47.589 --> 06:50.158
Just, uh, daydreaming,
plotting weekend outfits.

06:50.225 --> 06:51.492
Well, come on.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.361
You're going
to want to see this.

06:53.429 --> 06:55.229
I've called an emergency meeting

06:55.297 --> 06:56.297
of the Warblers'
Council.

06:56.365 --> 06:57.465
Oh, sounds serious.

06:57.533 --> 06:58.699
Let's hope not.

06:58.767 --> 07:01.102
I just need to ask them
a tiny little favor.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.837
This emergency meeting
is called to order.

07:02.905 --> 07:06.307
Junior member Blaine Anderson,
the floor is yours.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.943
Esteemed council,
I'll be brief.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.546
Simply put...

07:11.613 --> 07:14.115
I'm in love.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.384
Ooh!

07:16.452 --> 07:18.686
Congrats.

07:18.754 --> 07:20.922
I'm not really good
at talking about my feelings.

07:20.989 --> 07:22.690
I'm much better at singing them.

07:22.758 --> 07:25.493
But still, I could
use a little help.

07:25.561 --> 07:27.862
Which is why I'm asking
to enlist the Warblers

07:27.930 --> 07:29.864
to help serenade this individual

07:29.932 --> 07:31.766
in song

07:31.834 --> 07:34.569
off-campus.

07:34.636 --> 07:35.770
What?
What?!

07:35.838 --> 07:37.505
Off-campus?!
Are you serious?

07:37.573 --> 07:39.106
Did I hear you right?

07:39.174 --> 07:43.277
I- I know what I'm asking
is slightly unusual.

07:43.345 --> 07:44.645
The Warblers haven't performed

07:44.713 --> 07:46.447
in an informal setting
since 1927,

07:46.515 --> 07:48.883
<i>when the Spirit of St. Louis
overshot the tarmac</i>

07:48.951 --> 07:50.418
and plowed
through seven Warblers

07:50.486 --> 07:53.120
during an impromptu rendition of
"Welcome to Ohio, Lucky Lindy. "

07:53.188 --> 07:54.789
Why would
we even consider

07:54.857 --> 07:56.057
what you're asking?

07:56.124 --> 07:57.658
I firmly believe
that our reticence

07:57.726 --> 07:59.060
to perform in public

07:59.127 --> 08:00.194
nearly cost us a trip
to Regionals.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.696
We're becoming
privileged,

08:01.763 --> 08:04.198
porcelain birds perched on a...

08:04.266 --> 08:05.900
on a gilded shelf.
You mock us, sir.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.069
Thad, David?

08:08.136 --> 08:10.371
I will have order.
May I please say something?

08:11.640 --> 08:16.010
With respect, I believe
Blaine has a point.

08:16.078 --> 08:19.013
The Warblers are so
concerned with image

08:19.081 --> 08:21.215
and tradition
that sometimes I feel like

08:21.283 --> 08:24.552
we miss out on opportunities to
step outside our comfort zones.

08:24.620 --> 08:25.920
When I was
on New Directions,

08:25.988 --> 08:29.190
we performed in front
of hostile crowds

08:29.258 --> 08:30.424
pretty much
anywhere we went.

08:30.492 --> 08:32.827
I mean, mattress stores,
shopping malls.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.695
I had a cat thrown at me
in a nursing home once.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.965
But it-it gave us confidence.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.967
It-It kept us loose.

08:40.034 --> 08:41.969
And where would this performance
take place?

08:42.037 --> 08:44.338
The Gap at the North Hills Mall.

08:44.406 --> 08:46.340
I'd like to call it

08:46.408 --> 08:48.175
The Warblers' Gap Attack.

08:48.243 --> 08:49.944
Why the Gap?

08:50.012 --> 08:52.413
The guy
that I like is a junior manager.

08:53.715 --> 08:57.184
All right, well,
all those in favor?

08:57.252 --> 08:59.420
<i>I was absolutely devastated.
# I know something about... #</i>

08:59.488 --> 09:01.689
Did he ever actually say
you two were dating?

09:01.757 --> 09:05.092
Well, not in so many words.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.061
Well, did he put the moves on?

09:07.129 --> 09:08.996
No, but we were
always singing duets,

09:09.064 --> 09:10.898
and he was always
smiling at me.

09:10.966 --> 09:13.100
♪ The very part of you... ♪

09:13.168 --> 09:16.737
Oh, my God, I made up the whole
thing in my head, didn't I?

09:16.805 --> 09:18.306
Listen, we've all been there.

09:18.373 --> 09:20.274
At least I have.

09:20.342 --> 09:21.943
With you. I know exactly what you mean.

09:22.010 --> 09:23.144
I mean, if Finn thinks

09:23.211 --> 09:25.012
that he's just gonna
walk out of my life,

09:25.080 --> 09:26.581
he's wrong, 'cause
I'm gonna go up

09:26.648 --> 09:27.682
to that kissing booth tomorrow

09:27.749 --> 09:28.916
with a $100 bill
and he's not

09:28.984 --> 09:30.284
gonna be able to make change,

09:30.352 --> 09:31.752
and then he's gonna be forced

09:31.820 --> 09:32.987
to kiss me 100 times,
and when his lips touch mine,

09:33.055 --> 09:34.155
I'm telling you,

09:34.222 --> 09:35.456
he's gonna feel it.
Hey, hey.

09:35.524 --> 09:36.691
We're supposed to be giving
Kurt advice, remember?

09:36.758 --> 09:38.426
Yeah.

09:38.493 --> 09:40.428
You are going to the Gap Attack,
though, right?

09:40.495 --> 09:41.963
Should-Should I?

09:42.030 --> 09:43.164
Yes!
Mm-hmm.

09:43.231 --> 09:44.765
Scope out the competition.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.534
See what this guy's like.

09:46.602 --> 09:49.537
You know,
you two are both so guy crazy.

09:49.605 --> 09:51.038
Yeah. Look at me.

09:51.106 --> 09:52.740
I don't have a date
for Valentine's Day,

09:52.808 --> 09:54.175
and I could give a rip.

09:54.242 --> 09:56.277
The three of us
are divas.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.612
Look at our idols.

09:57.679 --> 10:00.114
Whitney, Barbra,
Patti LuPone.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.683
They all became stars
while they were single.

10:02.751 --> 10:04.251
They took all the pain

10:04.319 --> 10:06.954
and loneliness, and they put it
into their music.

10:07.022 --> 10:08.556
People could relate to it.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.591
Yeah, everybody
feels lonely.

10:10.659 --> 10:13.494
Harnessing this pain is why
they became legends.

10:13.562 --> 10:16.597
Why has this never
occurred to me?

10:16.665 --> 10:19.634
Sometimes you have to choose
between love and talent.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.869
And as far as I'm concerned,

10:21.937 --> 10:24.171
we all need
to fly solo for a while.

High five.

12:47.883 --> 12:50.050
Good job.

12:55.157 --> 12:58.259
So, um,
what'd you think?

12:58.326 --> 13:00.060
It was... That's kind
of my love song to you,

13:00.128 --> 13:02.329
'cause, you know,
you're a little...

13:02.397 --> 13:03.430
on the heavier
side, but,

13:03.498 --> 13:04.832
like the song says, you know,

13:04.900 --> 13:06.066
I'm kind of into it.

13:06.134 --> 13:08.202
So...

13:08.270 --> 13:10.838
That was the first time anyone
ever sang me a love song.

13:12.340 --> 13:14.341
And it made me feel like crap.

13:23.318 --> 13:24.685
I want tongue.

13:24.753 --> 13:28.656
Uh, thanks, Becky.

13:30.692 --> 13:31.792
Oh...

13:31.860 --> 13:32.893
Sorry, ladies.

13:32.961 --> 13:34.195
Brush and floss time.

13:34.262 --> 13:35.796
Got to keep up
the oral hygiene

13:35.864 --> 13:38.432
if I'm gonna satisfy
all of you. Sorry.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.434
I know why you're doing this.

13:40.502 --> 13:41.702
You know I'm
the only girl in school

13:41.770 --> 13:42.937
that won't kiss you,
and you think

13:43.004 --> 13:44.638
that the peer pressure
will get to me.

13:44.706 --> 13:47.208
Well, it is sort of uncool
that you... you're too uptight

13:47.275 --> 13:49.510
to spend a buck for a
good cause like Glee Club.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.378
I'm not kissing you again.

13:51.446 --> 13:53.814
What are you so afraid of?

13:53.882 --> 13:56.750
Leading you on,
hurting my boyfriend.

13:56.818 --> 13:58.986
Your boyfriend's a boy.

13:59.054 --> 14:01.622
Tell me you don't want
to kiss me right now.

14:01.690 --> 14:04.658
I can't do this.

14:12.107 --> 14:13.541
I saw it.

14:13.609 --> 14:14.642
Your guys' faces,
were, like,

14:14.710 --> 14:15.810
right up next
to each other.

14:15.878 --> 14:16.911
Kissing distance.

14:18.314 --> 14:20.248
What are these things?

14:20.316 --> 14:22.250
They're called records.

14:22.318 --> 14:24.152
People used to listen
to music on them.

14:24.219 --> 14:26.321
I'm looking for a classic
love song to sing to you

14:26.388 --> 14:28.056
for our assignment, because
despite your confusion

14:28.123 --> 14:29.757
about the matter,
you are the only guy

14:29.825 --> 14:31.192
I'm ever within
kissing distance of.

14:31.260 --> 14:32.393
Okay. So answer
me this, then.

14:32.461 --> 14:34.429
Why haven't you kissed
Finn at his booth yet?

14:34.496 --> 14:37.265
Okay, first you're all up in
my business for kissing Finn,

14:37.333 --> 14:38.900
and now you're pissed at
me for not kissing...

14:38.968 --> 14:40.635
It's odd.
Something seems fishy.

14:40.703 --> 14:42.203
I mean...
This is insane.

14:42.271 --> 14:43.771
Shh!

14:43.839 --> 14:45.173
Everyone thinks I'm dumb.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.008
Not... everyone.

14:47.076 --> 14:48.276
But I'm not.

14:48.344 --> 14:50.378
At least...
not about you.

14:50.446 --> 14:52.680
You play it cool,
but you're ambitious.

14:52.748 --> 14:54.782
You like being the queen bee,

14:54.850 --> 14:57.385
and you think being with star
quarterback Finn is going to

14:57.453 --> 14:58.853
put you up there,
whether you're wearing

14:58.921 --> 15:01.623
a Cheerios! uniform or not.
I'm pretty, but I ain't dumb.

15:01.690 --> 15:03.858
Fine. Right after
Glee rehearsal,

15:03.926 --> 15:05.727
I'm kissing Finn.

15:09.465 --> 15:11.766
Thanks.

15:14.103 --> 15:15.403
Are you sure
you can handle this?

15:15.471 --> 15:16.904
Oh, absolutely.

15:16.972 --> 15:18.539
I've decided that
I'm better off without you.

15:18.607 --> 15:21.643
Not without you specifically,

15:21.710 --> 15:23.711
but without any man
who's going to keep me

15:23.779 --> 15:25.279
from achieving
my goals of stardom.

15:25.347 --> 15:27.715
Sweet. Uh...

15:27.783 --> 15:29.183
Well, we should
probably kiss.

15:29.251 --> 15:30.385
There's a line-up.

15:33.789 --> 15:36.958
What-What the hell?
On the cheek?

15:37.026 --> 15:39.827
Wait, I thought you
said you were over me.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.029
I am, but I still...

15:41.096 --> 15:42.296
I still want a real kiss.

15:42.364 --> 15:43.564
That was not a dollar kiss.

15:43.632 --> 15:45.133
I knew you were lying
about being through

15:45.200 --> 15:46.067
with love and
all that stuff.

15:46.135 --> 15:47.502
Okay, fine. I still love you.

15:47.569 --> 15:48.936
Okay? Is that
what you want to hear?

15:55.377 --> 15:57.812
Why can't you
just forgive me?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.747
You cheated on me.
That means something.

15:59.815 --> 16:00.848
What does it mean?

16:00.916 --> 16:02.316
That I was stupid?
That I was angry?

16:02.384 --> 16:04.285
I- I don't care about Puck.

16:04.353 --> 16:06.754
I don't care
about anybody but you.

16:14.496 --> 16:15.563
It's Valentine's Day.

16:15.631 --> 16:16.731
Oh, yeah.

16:16.799 --> 16:18.766
I ordered it for
you for Christmas

16:18.834 --> 16:20.568
before we broke up.

16:20.636 --> 16:22.103
Just open it.

16:30.646 --> 16:33.381
I think you're right

16:33.449 --> 16:35.483
about wanting to be
alone for a while.

16:35.551 --> 16:36.884
'Cause let's face it, Rachel.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.786
You're better than
everyone in this school.

16:38.854 --> 16:41.622
You don't need me or any other
guy to anchor you to Lima.

16:41.690 --> 16:43.658
You're a real star.

16:43.726 --> 16:45.393
And you need to shine.

16:45.461 --> 16:48.730
Just because I
can't be with you,

16:48.797 --> 16:50.732
it doesn't mean I
don't believe in you.

16:55.738 --> 16:57.705
Thank you.

17:03.612 --> 17:05.046
It's weird.
Who'd have guessed

17:05.114 --> 17:07.548
that the quiet, skinny Asian guy
and the kid in the wheelchair

17:07.616 --> 17:10.184
would end up dating two of
the raddest girls in school?

17:10.252 --> 17:12.920
No jealousy.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.422
No drama.
Nope.

17:14.490 --> 17:15.723
I don't know
how we did it.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.290

Tenderoni!

19:10.973 --> 19:12.173
I'm so in love,

19:12.241 --> 19:13.875
I may just start crying.
Aw...

19:17.112 --> 19:18.613
What's that?

19:18.680 --> 19:19.881
It's a receipt.

19:19.948 --> 19:21.015
I went to Jared.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.183
You can reimburse me,

19:22.251 --> 19:23.618
we'll have dinner
at Breadstix,

19:23.685 --> 19:24.986
and then we can
consider this settled.

19:25.053 --> 19:27.855
Um, no.
And consider what settled?

19:27.923 --> 19:29.156
Look, you've
made your point.

19:29.224 --> 19:30.191
I'm sort of a bitch.

19:30.259 --> 19:31.826
But I'm willing to change.

19:31.894 --> 19:33.194
I won't tell Lauren

19:33.262 --> 19:34.729
to look out for poachers
who might mistake her

19:34.796 --> 19:36.397
for the endangered
White Rhino.

19:36.465 --> 19:37.665
I heard that.

19:37.733 --> 19:40.468
Don't make me rip that
weave out ya head.

19:40.535 --> 19:42.603
This is not gonna be good.

19:42.671 --> 19:43.771
Hello, Lauren.

19:43.839 --> 19:46.073
You are a beautiful person.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.275
Thank you.

19:47.342 --> 19:48.709
Now, get out
of my way, please,

19:48.777 --> 19:50.011
a- fores I ends you.

19:50.078 --> 19:51.779
You don't want
to push me.

19:51.847 --> 19:54.815
Oh. But, see,
I- I sort of do.

19:54.883 --> 19:56.617
I'm from a part of town

19:56.685 --> 19:58.886
called Lima
Heights adjacent.

19:58.954 --> 20:01.255
You know where that
is, Poppin' Fresh?

20:01.323 --> 20:04.392
It's on the wrong
side of the tracks.

20:16.638 --> 20:17.972
Hey!

20:40.929 --> 20:43.631
Hey! Knock it off and get going!

20:43.699 --> 20:47.368
Yeah. That's how we do it
in Lima Heights.

20:47.436 --> 20:49.270
Get you to the nurse.

20:51.073 --> 20:52.840
Please go out with me.

20:52.908 --> 20:54.542
Just... Please.

20:54.609 --> 20:56.978
You make a formal
presentation,

20:57.045 --> 20:58.746
and I'll consider it.

21:06.989 --> 21:09.190
Wait.

21:09.257 --> 21:11.125
Hold on.
I want to see this.

21:11.193 --> 21:13.260
Pervert?
I'd prefer "chaperone,"

21:13.328 --> 21:14.161
and also "boyfriend. "

21:32.681 --> 21:34.682
Satisfied?

21:34.750 --> 21:36.650
Yeah. Let's go.
Hmm.

21:36.718 --> 21:38.819
So I took a bunch
of those records

21:38.887 --> 21:40.321
you were looking at
in the library,

21:40.389 --> 21:41.589
and I'm gonna load
them into my iTunes.

21:41.656 --> 21:43.357
Hey, I forgot my purse.

21:45.227 --> 21:47.995
Meet me tomorrow afternoon
in the auditorium.

21:51.233 --> 21:52.633
Fireworks.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.948
That's him. The blonde one
folding sweaters.

21:57.016 --> 21:57.949
Hmm.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.085
I can see the appeal.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.119
That's quite
a ad of hair.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.854
His name is Jeremiah.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.158
If he and I got married, the Gap
would give me a 50% discount.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.861
This is insane.
I don't know what I'm doing.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.029
We haven't even really
gone out on a date.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.697
We-We shouldn't do this.
This is crazy.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.065
Okay. Come on.
Come on. Man up.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.267
You're amazing.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.202
He's gonna love you.

Hey.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.569
What the hell were you doing?

25:04.637 --> 25:05.870
What?

25:05.938 --> 25:06.905
I just got fired.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.641
You can't just
bust a groove

25:09.709 --> 25:11.009
in the middle of
somebody else's workplace.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.677
But they loved it.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.346
Well, my boss didn't.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.747
Neither did I.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.350
No one here knows I'm gay.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.018
Can I be honest?
Just, with the hair?

25:20.086 --> 25:21.753
I think they do.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.556
Blaine, let's just
be clear here.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.324
You and I got coffee twice.

25:26.392 --> 25:27.592
We're not dating.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.627
If we were,
I'd get arrested,

25:29.695 --> 25:31.563
'cause you're underage.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.775
Oh, yeah.
That's my ear.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.110
That's my ear. I
love it. I like it.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.781
<i>Ugh, gross.</i>

25:49.849 --> 25:51.383
<i>How is this possible?</i>

25:51.450 --> 25:53.284
<i>I'm the hottest piece
of action at this school,</i>

25:53.352 --> 25:55.587
<i>and here I am
on Valentine's, single.</i>

25:55.654 --> 25:57.522
<i>Whatever.</i>

25:57.590 --> 25:58.823
<i>I'll just marry an NFL player.</i>

25:58.891 --> 26:00.592
<i>They're super reliable.</i>

26:05.231 --> 26:07.399
<i>Wait, that's weird.</i>

26:07.466 --> 26:09.100
<i>Quinn's wearing
her queen bitch smirk,</i>

26:09.168 --> 26:11.603
<i>and Finn only wears
that gassy infant look</i>

26:11.670 --> 26:14.606
<i>when he feels guilty
about something.</i>

26:14.673 --> 26:17.609
<i>Holy sweet hell.</i>

26:17.676 --> 26:19.511
<i>They're fooling around.</i>

26:19.578 --> 26:20.578
<i>I know
what cheating looks like.</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:21.780
<i>I do it all the time.</i>

26:24.450 --> 26:26.651
<i>Well, I think it's time</i>

26:26.719 --> 26:29.320
<i>to do what Santana does best.</i>

26:29.388 --> 26:31.156
<i>Revenge.</i>

26:31.223 --> 26:34.426
<i>I've always loved volunteering
at the local hospital,</i>

26:34.493 --> 26:36.961
<i>and not just because of the
sexy candy striper outfit.</i>

26:37.029 --> 26:39.898
<i>Giving back is so important.</i>

26:39.965 --> 26:41.833
Excuse me.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.269
Are there any sick students
I can help you tend to?

26:44.336 --> 26:46.638
Wes Fahey's
down with mono

26:46.705 --> 26:48.573
and he's waiting for
his mom to pick him up.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.075
But you shouldn't go in there.
It's highly contagious.

26:51.143 --> 26:54.979
Please. I've had mono so many
times, it turned into stereo.

26:58.818 --> 26:59.984
Hi.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.922
So, I'm gonna need
to borrow your germs.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.201
Thanks.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.040
Whoa, whoa.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.409
Sorry about that.
I couldn't help myself.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.445
If I have anything,
I hope it's not contagious.

27:27.513 --> 27:28.913
But what? What?

27:33.018 --> 27:35.420
Hi. Hi.

27:36.856 --> 27:37.989
What is this place?

27:38.057 --> 27:39.791
It's the library.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.560
Haven't you been
in here before?

27:42.628 --> 27:43.995
No? Okay.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.530
I don't understand.

27:45.598 --> 27:46.998
You said you want
to formally ask me out,

27:47.066 --> 27:48.399
but I see no
envelope of cash,

27:48.467 --> 27:50.168
no muffin basket.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.269
I sang to you.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.204
An offensive song.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.509
I don't think you're
ready for this jelly.

27:57.576 --> 28:00.011
Wait. I mean, let's
be honest here,

28:00.079 --> 28:01.579
you look...

28:01.647 --> 28:03.281
the way you look.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.216
And I'm embracing that.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.818
I mean, it turns
me on, babe.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.486
I look like America looks.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.255
And, like America,

28:10.322 --> 28:12.657
I need more than just a song
to get my juices flowing.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.698
Lauren Zizes,
will you go

28:20.766 --> 28:22.467
to Breadstix
with me tomorrow night?

28:22.535 --> 28:24.502
Tomorrow's not
Valentine's Day.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.271
Tomorrow's the pre-date.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.439
'Cause our mouths are going
to be too busy macking out

28:28.507 --> 28:30.108
on Valentine's Day
to eat anything.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.445
I like your style,
Puckerman.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.381
I dine at 8:00.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.084
Now, get out of here,
before I change my mind.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.486
Yeah.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.388
Good-bye.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.725
Sorry. I was at church.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.360
Praying for the
strength to come?

28:49.428 --> 28:50.295
Not to.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.802
You realize this
is making me a cheater,

28:57.870 --> 29:01.205
the thing that hurt you so badly

29:01.273 --> 29:04.075
that it made you
break up with me.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.010
And Rachel.

29:08.681 --> 29:11.282
You know why it hurt so bad
when you guys cheated on me?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.084
'Cause it meant
you didn't love me.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.086
That's not true.
No. At least not enough

29:15.154 --> 29:17.722
to not want t to hurt me, and
that's the thing about cheating.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.624
When you really love
someone, you'd do anything

29:19.692 --> 29:20.758
to keep them safe.

29:20.826 --> 29:21.726
I love Sam.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.161
No, you don't.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.329
Or else you wouldn't
have come here.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.964
Fine.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.832
I think I love him.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.467
No matter what happens
between us,

29:29.535 --> 29:31.269
I'm not going
to break up with Sam

29:31.337 --> 29:33.004
until I know for sure
one way or another.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.405
Okay.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.708
Do you think you can love
two people at one time?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.310
Not totally.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.812
You have to choose, eventually.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.513
Not yet.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.758
Don't they
have anything here

29:51.826 --> 29:54.494
that isn't covered with
stupid, little hearts?

29:54.562 --> 29:56.296
Gross.

29:56.364 --> 29:59.066
Well, you've certainly
changed your tune.

29:59.133 --> 30:02.302
I don't think I've ever made
that big a fool of myself,

30:02.370 --> 30:04.304
which is really
saying something,

30:04.372 --> 30:06.373
because I've performed
at theme parks.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.243
I just... I can't believe

30:09.310 --> 30:11.078
I made it all
up in my head.

30:11.145 --> 30:14.581
Okay,
can I ask you something?

30:14.649 --> 30:16.550
Because we've always
been completely honest

30:16.618 --> 30:17.851
with each other.

30:17.919 --> 30:20.520
You and I? We hang out.

30:20.588 --> 30:23.056
We sing flirty duets together.

30:23.124 --> 30:24.825
You know my coffee order.

30:24.893 --> 30:27.361
Was I supposed to think
that that was nothing?

30:27.428 --> 30:29.229
What do you mean?

30:31.065 --> 30:33.533
I thought the guy
that you wanted to ask out

30:33.601 --> 30:37.004
on Valentine's Day was me.

30:41.943 --> 30:44.077
Oh, wow.

30:46.281 --> 30:48.115
I really am clueless.

30:50.718 --> 30:53.053
Look, Kurt...

30:53.121 --> 30:55.789
I don't know
what I'm doing.

30:55.857 --> 30:58.325
I pretend like I do.

30:58.393 --> 31:00.827
And I know how to
act it out in song,

31:00.895 --> 31:02.763
but the truth is...

31:05.099 --> 31:08.802
I've never really been
anyone's boyfriend.

31:10.638 --> 31:12.205
Me, neither.

31:14.375 --> 31:16.576
Let me be really
clear about something.

31:16.644 --> 31:20.213
I really, really
care about you.

31:20.281 --> 31:23.717
But as you and about 20
mortified shoppers saw,

31:23.785 --> 31:25.519
I'm not very
good at romance.

31:28.189 --> 31:30.324
I don't want to screw this up.

31:32.293 --> 31:34.328
<i>So it's just like
When Harry Met Sally.</i>

31:34.395 --> 31:36.029
But I get to play Meg Ryan.

31:36.097 --> 31:37.331
Deal.

31:40.268 --> 31:41.835
Don't they, uh, get
together in the end?

31:43.604 --> 31:45.639
Could I get a nonfat mocha,
and a medium drip

31:45.707 --> 31:47.007
for my friend
Billy Crystal?

31:47.075 --> 31:48.842
Ah, you know my
coffee order.

31:48.910 --> 31:50.744
You know what?

31:50.812 --> 31:53.246
I think I've got something
for us to do on Valentine's Day.

32:00.521 --> 32:01.955
Thanks for doing this.

32:02.023 --> 32:03.490
It really takes
the sting off.

32:03.558 --> 32:05.092
It's cool.
My dad's a drug addict,

32:05.159 --> 32:06.293
so losers make me horny.

32:06.361 --> 32:08.061
I'm not a loser.

32:08.129 --> 32:09.696
This is the first time
I've ever been stood up.

32:09.764 --> 32:11.832
Must be some chick
to blow you off.

32:14.168 --> 32:17.070
Michelle, I've been covering
your section for 15 minutes.

32:17.138 --> 32:18.271
Your break's over.

32:18.339 --> 32:19.840
And your husband called.

32:24.445 --> 32:26.279
Well, I did it.

32:26.347 --> 32:28.415
I kissed every girl
in this school,

32:28.483 --> 32:31.351
and raised $324
for the Glee Club.

32:31.419 --> 32:33.120
All right, Finn. Thanks.

32:33.187 --> 32:34.688
That'll pay for half a
ticket to Nationals.

32:34.756 --> 32:35.722
So...

32:35.790 --> 32:37.424
Still a long way to go.

32:37.492 --> 32:38.592
All right?

32:38.659 --> 32:40.027
Okay.

32:40.094 --> 32:41.795
Now I believe
it's time to hear

32:41.863 --> 32:43.296
what the world's greatest

32:43.364 --> 32:45.665
love song means to
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

32:45.733 --> 32:46.833
Come on up.
Whoo!

32:46.901 --> 32:48.602
Is anyone else hot?

32:48.669 --> 32:49.870
It's really
stuffy in here.

32:49.937 --> 32:51.038
This is for you, Mike.

32:51.105 --> 32:52.372

34:16.123 --> 34:17.791
That was good.
Thank you.

34:17.859 --> 34:20.560
Okay. Wow, that was... powerful.

34:20.628 --> 34:22.462
Almost too powerful.

34:22.530 --> 34:25.098
Mr. Shue, can I be excused?
I don't feel well.

34:25.166 --> 34:28.435
Me, either.
I feel sick.

34:28.503 --> 34:29.835
Let me guess.

34:29.904 --> 34:31.271
You have a sore throat,
and your glands are swollen,

34:31.339 --> 34:32.706
and you're feverish.

34:32.773 --> 34:36.275
Yeah. Yeah, which is why
I need to go to the nurse.

34:36.344 --> 34:38.043
It sounds like you have mono.

34:38.112 --> 34:40.679
Otherwise known
as the kissing disease.

34:40.748 --> 34:42.681
But you know what
really helps spread it?

34:42.750 --> 34:44.251
A little tongue.

34:44.318 --> 34:45.585
Which is weird, because

34:45.652 --> 34:47.687
it sounds like
Quinn here has it, too.

34:47.722 --> 34:49.456
I was there
when they kissed.

34:49.524 --> 34:50.757
It was just a peck.

34:50.824 --> 34:52.592
So, how about we stop
talking about tonguing,

34:52.659 --> 34:54.661
and Finn and I go to the nurse?

34:54.728 --> 34:57.898
You know what?
I think that is a capital idea!

35:01.142 --> 35:02.575
I've cheated twice in my life.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.677
The first time, I got pregnant.

35:04.745 --> 35:06.813
The second time, I got mono.

35:08.549 --> 35:11.518
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

35:11.585 --> 35:12.385
Maybe.

35:12.453 --> 35:14.387
But I think Sam likes you enough

35:14.455 --> 35:16.389
to believe
whatever story you told him.

35:16.457 --> 35:18.625
Santana is such a bitch.

35:18.692 --> 35:20.160
It looks like mono to me.

35:20.227 --> 35:21.861
I called your mothers.

35:21.929 --> 35:24.130
You can hang here
till they pick you up,

35:24.198 --> 35:25.298
but no kissing.

35:30.604 --> 35:32.205
I'm not done
with us yet.

35:34.575 --> 35:37.110
You have to stop.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.679
Nothing can happen between us,
until I figure out

35:39.747 --> 35:41.781
what's going on with me and Sam

35:41.849 --> 35:44.551
and you figure out what's
going on with you and Rachel.

35:44.618 --> 35:47.754
But... nothing's...

35:47.822 --> 35:50.123
Nothing's going on
with me and Rachel.

35:50.191 --> 35:53.927
All I know is that when
I don't catch you staring at me,

35:53.994 --> 35:56.863
you're staring at her.

36:01.702 --> 36:04.537
<i>Hello... Lauren.</i>

36:04.605 --> 36:06.172
What's with the chilly willy,
Puckerman?

36:06.240 --> 36:10.143
Honestly, I'm not used
to getting stood up.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.845
Last night?

36:11.912 --> 36:13.913
Breadstix?

36:13.981 --> 36:15.982
Oh, we had a date, didn't we?

36:16.050 --> 36:17.283
Look, I get it.

36:17.351 --> 36:19.419
You've been hurt
by guys before.

36:19.487 --> 36:20.987
But I'm telling you,
I'm not like that.

36:21.055 --> 36:23.323
First of all, you got a girl
pregnant last year,

36:23.390 --> 36:24.657
so, yeah, you are.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.260
And B: What makes you assume
guys treat me badly?

36:27.328 --> 36:28.862
I can take care of myself.

36:28.929 --> 36:30.597
That's what I like about you.

36:30.664 --> 36:33.700
I'm not into you
because you... have curves. I...

36:33.767 --> 36:35.401
What I like is
that you're a girl

36:35.469 --> 36:37.137
who's an even bigger bad ass
than me.

36:37.204 --> 36:40.507
Can I be honest with you?

36:40.574 --> 36:43.710
I like you. I used to think you
were smokin', but a lot of that

36:43.777 --> 36:45.979
had to do with the fact
that I thought you were

36:46.046 --> 36:48.515
mixed race, and that never
fails to get me going.

36:48.582 --> 36:49.883
But here's the
thing, Puckerman.

36:49.950 --> 36:52.085
I'm not just looking for
somebody to fool around with,

36:52.153 --> 36:54.821
so if you're really into me,
you got to take it slow.

36:54.889 --> 36:57.790
I suppose
I could give that a shot.

36:57.858 --> 36:59.292
Then you're on
for Valentine's Day.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.426
As friends.

37:07.334 --> 37:09.302
Where's Quinn?

37:09.370 --> 37:12.071
Uh...

37:12.139 --> 37:15.341
Uh, her mom picked her
up a few hours ago.

37:15.409 --> 37:17.544
Quinn really
is very pretty.

37:19.213 --> 37:21.347
You don't have to
do that, you know.

37:21.415 --> 37:24.217
No. I would do it for anyone.

37:25.819 --> 37:27.720
She's prettier than me.

37:27.788 --> 37:30.089
Would you stop?

37:30.157 --> 37:31.991
You're beautiful.

37:34.461 --> 37:36.196
I know she is.

37:36.263 --> 37:39.199
It meant so much to me
that you chose me over her.

37:39.266 --> 37:42.235
Girls like me don't get chosen
over girls like her very much.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.470
Did you kiss her?

37:44.538 --> 37:47.140
Like Santana said?

37:47.208 --> 37:50.510
Yeah, yeah, but I-I just needed
to get it out of my system.

37:50.578 --> 37:52.679
So, what did it feel like?

37:52.746 --> 37:55.381
When you kissed her?

37:56.584 --> 37:59.219
Fireworks.

37:59.286 --> 38:01.588
Did you see fireworks
when you kissed me?

38:09.196 --> 38:10.396
Rachel, wait.

38:10.464 --> 38:12.098
No.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.234
It's good. Thank you.

38:14.301 --> 38:15.568
Look, you've given me

38:15.636 --> 38:17.670
the strength to move on.

38:17.738 --> 38:21.107
I know now that there's...
nothing here for me anymore.

38:21.175 --> 38:22.909
That's not the truth.

38:22.977 --> 38:26.212
I still... I'm just...

38:26.280 --> 38:28.014
I'm so confused
in my head right now.

38:28.082 --> 38:29.415
No, it's okay.
Look, I understand.

38:29.483 --> 38:31.050
Now I'm free

38:31.118 --> 38:33.920
to pursue my dreams without
anything holding me back.

38:33.988 --> 38:37.190
And you've actually inspired
my song selection

38:37.258 --> 38:38.791
for this week's
love song assignment.

38:38.859 --> 38:41.861
