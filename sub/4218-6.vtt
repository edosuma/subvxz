00:01.043 --> 00:04.253
Previously on
Chicago Fire...
Let's go! Let's go!

00:07.132 --> 00:08.424
I need a favor, Anna.

00:08.592 --> 00:11.010
Be careful with these.
Take them only when necessary.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.388
What do we got?
Trapped arm.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.223
One, two...

00:16.558 --> 00:17.475
I'm going with him.
No, you're not.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.643
This ain't
up to you, lady.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.854
You have a bit of a
track record lately,
wouldn't you say?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.107
This isn't enough to
warrant suspension.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.274
Be ready for the
possibility.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.527
Evacuate immediately!
Go!

00:31.573 --> 00:33.533
Honey, this is
my old girlfriend.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.578
I'm just gonna lift your
shirt and make sure everything
is okay with the baby.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.790
Why don't you, um,
give me a call?

00:43.127 --> 00:44.877
Just stay the hell
away from us!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.587
I'm not retracting
my statement.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.755
Ever.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.592
Talk some sense
into your man.
Excuse me?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.554
I'd really hate to see
things things get uglier
than they already are.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.155
Gabriela...
Hey.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.619
Thank you for meeting me.
Yeah, of course.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.497
I hope it wasn't
an inconvenience.
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.256
I know you and Matt
are... close.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.009
Oh, uh...
Can I get you
something to drink?

01:33.177 --> 01:34.469
Uh, coffee's fine.
Thank you.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.598
I didn't want to go to
the chief about this
because...

01:41.643 --> 01:46.147
God, I'm so sorry...
Oh, it's okay.
What's... what's wrong?

01:49.234 --> 01:50.777
It's the
Detective Voight thing.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.988
I, um... I know your
brother's been trying
to help.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.617
Yeah, that's right.
It's just I have never
seen Matt like this,

01:57.785 --> 02:01.120
and I have a feeling
that something bad
is gonna happen.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.456
I'm really sorry for
everything you're
going through, Hallie, I am,

02:03.624 --> 02:04.957
but I'm not sure
what I can do.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.502
Matt's deposition
is scheduled after his shift.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.670
Once he testifies
against Voight's son...

02:11.215 --> 02:15.092
It's... it's not
worth it anymore,
just to prove a point.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.970
And I'm thinking more
and more that Matt shouldn't
go through with it.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.473
You should tell Matt.

02:20.641 --> 02:25.520
I did. Last night.
And he wouldn't listen.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.983
But I think he would
if it came from you.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.416
Hey, hold still, just relax.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.296
"Zit?"
I didn't do that.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.299
Of course not. Look, this
is as far as I can go.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.510
You've got to come
the rest of the way.
You mean drop?

02:57.678 --> 02:58.886
That's right.

03:02.724 --> 03:07.395
"Zito." Big time tagger.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've seen his name around.

03:07.563 --> 03:11.274
Yeah. He's hit every
"L" train, bus stop
and mailbox in Chicago.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.817
You president
of his fan club?

03:13.777 --> 03:16.696
No. I went to the street art
exhibition at the MCA.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.322
This clown's in a museum?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.784
What a country. Right?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.915
Just slide on down,
nice and easy. I got you.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.794
You called the cops!

03:36.508 --> 03:38.801
All right.
Now! Just drop!

03:44.266 --> 03:46.601
- Coming down.
- Copy. All clear.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.983
All good?
Yeah, graffiti artist got
stuck up there, Chief.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.202
Kelly.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.167
You got no reason to be here.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.169
Oh, I'm collecting
gang intel, Chief.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.380
Big new tag like that,
gotta make sure it doesn't
spark a turf war.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.926
You've seen it.
Now leave.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.511
You might want to
take a step back there.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.430
I don't want to charge
you or one of your men

04:24.598 --> 04:27.475
with interfering with a
police investigation.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.728
Yeah.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.273
Pack it up.
We're out of here.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.695
Oh hey, Casey.
You've got your
deposition tomorrow.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.988
Come on,
let's go.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.783
Let me ask you, is that
cute little fiancée of yours
gonna be there too?

04:44.660 --> 04:46.994
Because, I gotta tell you,
the other night when we
were talking,

04:47.162 --> 04:49.705
she seemed kinda,
I don't know, shut down.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.833
But by the end, she really
started to open up.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.713
Casey!
Your day's coming.
Your day's coming, Voight!

05:14.523 --> 05:15.523
Close the door.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.200
You all right?
Yeah.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.785
What do you want to do?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.203
About...
You.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.330
You want to go out on calls?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.124
Stay here in the house?
Take some time off?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.585
Go out on calls.
Then you have
to do it right.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.795
I have been.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.506
You've heard me say
this a million times.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.009
In this job, regardless
of what's going on
in your life,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.845
you take your eye off
it for one sec,
people can die.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.433
You're right, I have
heard you say that,
and we're in agreement.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.814
I wish I could
do more to fix this.

05:56.982 --> 06:00.776
But right now, it
is just a matter
of trusting the system.

06:03.989 --> 06:07.116
And Matt...
There won't be
another warning.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.463
Hey.
Hey. Look...

06:22.215 --> 06:23.549
Look, man, you want
to hit somebody,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.885
my buddy has a boxing gym
over in Bucktown.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.055
You get a trainer, you
glove up, you hit mitts.
Five bucks a round.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.306
We could head over
there after shift.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.935
Yeah, I'll think
about it. Thanks.

06:39.566 --> 06:43.319
Not to sound like my
father-in-law, but this
is what's wrong with America.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.113
What's wrong with America,
or what's great about America?

06:46.281 --> 06:47.531
Are you kidding me?

06:48.366 --> 06:53.079
Three thousand clams for that,
and I'm out there doing side
jobs for 20 dollars an hour?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.456
Hey, Mouch is looking for you.

06:55.624 --> 06:59.001
Do you know how much the
taxpayers of this city
pay for graffiti removal?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.212
50 million a year.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.048
Uh, that...
that sounds high.
Look it up.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.635
All right, stop, all right.
So it's more like
25 million or something.

07:07.803 --> 07:11.305
Either way, it's a lot
of money. And then this little
wannabe hood rat...

07:11.473 --> 07:13.766
Hey!
It's bold.
It's provocative.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.018
You're just trying
to get a rise.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.563
And look at these high society
douche bags lapping it up.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.233
You see, this is why
when my kids get
outta high school,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.860
Cindy and me, we're moving
to Chain O' Lakes. 'Cause...

07:26.446 --> 07:27.905
I can't deal
with this insanity!

07:31.243 --> 07:33.369
How long am I looking at?
Realistically.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.914
Somewhere between
zero and 100 days.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.711
Do you understand
the definition
of "realistically"?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.881
There's a lot of
moving parts to this.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.180
They're on your head.
Ah.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.559
Have you ever even been to a
suspension hearing before?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.269
Of course.

07:58.436 --> 08:02.606
Your case is a two demerit
issuance so we're gonna
keep it friendly.

08:02.774 --> 08:06.694
The more aggressive you
come across, the more
guilty you'll look.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.488
Keep your responses
short and to the point...

08:09.656 --> 08:11.824
Alright, cool, so you're
you got this, right, Mouch?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.827
Yeah, but we still
gotta prep.
Where you going?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.081
Hey.
Hey.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.337
Sorry, just what you need,
right? One more person
asking how you're doing.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.674
Better than nobody giving
a rat's ass, I guess.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.013
So, how are
you holding up?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.639
I'm just hoping that
luck's on my side,

08:35.807 --> 08:38.517
because in terms of me
being able to control the
situation...

08:39.936 --> 08:41.312
It hasn't worked
out so well.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.731
Uh...

08:45.400 --> 08:48.777
But I guess there is one
more thing you could do to
end this whole thing, right?

08:52.282 --> 08:54.783
Have you thought about
retracting your statement?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.454
Would you?

09:00.832 --> 09:01.665
I would think about it.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.003
Okay. Now that you have...

09:12.844 --> 09:14.762
Why would you advise me
to do something you wouldn't?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.479
I...

09:24.898 --> 09:28.943
Ambulance 61,
Truck 81. Gunshot victim.
25 East Halsted Street.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.122
Come on, move it!

09:45.293 --> 09:46.293
Come on!

09:47.128 --> 09:48.128
Wait!

09:50.340 --> 09:51.757
Where's the victim?
In the back.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.593
Shooter?
Gone. I swerved when
I heard the shots.

09:54.761 --> 09:59.306
Cruz, Mills, in the bus.
Cones and flares,
get these cars moving.

10:01.059 --> 10:06.563
Shot to the neck,
not breathing, weak pulse.
Guys, we need your help.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.731
Okay, get him down here.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.821
Down here is good.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.030
Watch his head,
watch his head.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.873
Okay. We've got to get
an open airway or we're
gonna lose him right now.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.877
Here, open this.
We can't tube him,
too much mouth trauma.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.671
All right, surgical cric.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.007
Not approved in the
field, Dawson.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.802
Excuse me, sir, does that
really matter to you
right now? No? Okay, good.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.471
Give it to me.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.849
I got it.
Dawson,
give it to me, now.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.861
All right,
give me the tube.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.321
We'll get the
backboard and stretcher.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.627
Hey, Chief.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.506
Hey, keep it moving!
Let's go, let's go!

11:14.674 --> 11:15.841
Surgical cric?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.093
Could've waited for
approval, but then he
would've been DOA.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.804
It was my call, Chief.
I'll take the hit.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.853
Hey! What was that?
What are you doing?

11:28.021 --> 11:32.024
Huh?
No, you're gonna wait.
Oh, you wanna do that? Go on.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.152
Casey! Your shift is over.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.820
Oh, come on, Chief.
No, no, no, no. Go home.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.114
Head for the house,
whatever you want,
but you are done for the day.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.068
Where's Casey?

12:23.535 --> 12:26.203
Chief.
I am not taking
any more chances.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.873
He's doing the right
thing and he's getting
his ass kicked for it.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.291
You don't you
think I know that?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.335
Then he needs
to be here, where we can
keep an eye on him.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.212
Kelly... I tried that already.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.048
So he's better off out there,
by himself, pissed off,
not thinking straight?

12:38.216 --> 12:40.050
This is a firehouse!

12:41.261 --> 12:42.970
Not some of the time,
not for some of the calls.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.514
Any man who walks
through that door,
he gotta be ready.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.850
If he isn't,
he's gonna be walking
in the other direction.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.939
'Cause I am a chief first
and I am a friend second.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.195
Casey's just gonna have
to find his own way
from now on.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.661
Saline?
Two.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.496
Ambu bag?

13:09.664 --> 13:13.125
One. Do you also want me
to tell you how much gas
we have left in the ambu tank?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.669
Because apparently all
I'm good for is inventory
and driving now.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.005
Listen, one more black
mark on your record
between now and Friday...

13:18.173 --> 13:20.007
Why even go to the hearing
if you're already
suspending me?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.551
Maybe I don't want to ride
around with a half-ass
reliever for three months,

13:22.719 --> 13:23.719
ever thought of that?

13:28.850 --> 13:30.476
Listen, Chief did
the right thing.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.978
Gave him some
time to cool off.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.441
He's gonna be fine.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.956
We should eat, huh?
Make a sandwich.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.632
So... Casey's out
for how long?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.343
Chief knows that.
Not me.

14:04.511 --> 14:09.681
I got a suspension hearing
to prepare for. Send Dawson
in if you see her.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.186
You know, I feel like
we're sitting around
like a bunch of pussies

14:14.354 --> 14:16.647
while we let Voight
push our boy around.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.357
Why can't we take the
ballgame to him?

14:18.525 --> 14:22.152
I got a wife and four kids
who don't need their dad
fired or locked up.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.278
How 'bout you, Mills?

14:23.446 --> 14:24.947
Why aren't you asking me?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.991
Because I'm not talking
about toilet papering
Voight's house, O.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.411
How 'bout it, Mills?
I'm down.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.497
Okay, the both of you,
shut up.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.749
Nobody's gonna
do nothing.
So we just sit by?

14:35.917 --> 14:40.712
Then go. Put on a ski mask
and take on a dirty cop,
and see how far that gets you.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.902
What's the latest?
Nothing yet.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.949
What, what are you saying?
What's that, zero? Square one?
What do you mean nothing?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.659
I've been doing plenty.

15:10.827 --> 15:14.121
But if you're asking if I have
anything conclusive at this
moment, the answer is no.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.164
Well, what have you
been doing, Antonio?

15:16.332 --> 15:19.626
I would love to know,
because this whole thing
is unraveling for Casey.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.630
Voight's put the word out
on the street. We know that.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.882
So we're looking for
someone to wear a wire.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.801
Yesterday we busted
a kid for possession.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.511
He's in a gang with
ties to Voight.

15:29.679 --> 15:33.348
I offered him a deal if he
flipped. I had him this
close... but he wouldn't go.

15:34.183 --> 15:38.604
So offer him
something else.
It don't work like that.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.065
As long as Casey doesn't take
the bait, this thing is gonna
play out the way we want.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.695
So sit tight.
Have a little faith
in your brother.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.786
Why don't we just leave?
We both have vacation
time built up.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.414
We could even go longer.
I'm sure they would give you
a leave of absence.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.915
And when we get back?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.500
Voight will have
forgotten all about it?

16:00.668 --> 16:03.253
We go where he can't find us,
and we give the cops
enough time to bust him.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.467
Come on, baby.
Let's get out of here.
Let's regroup.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.731
Matthew Casey?
Yeah.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.193
We have a warrant
to search your home.
What?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.779
We got a tip says you're
in possession of cocaine.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.782
Either we can search
your house, or you can
produce the cocaine,

16:31.949 --> 16:34.076
and your cooperation will be
taken into consideration.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.496
Voight. Detective Voight,
he put you up to this?

16:38.539 --> 16:41.917
No,
I don't know any Voight.
I just know we're coming in.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.511
The warrant allows us to
search the entire house,

16:52.679 --> 16:55.806
and you are allowed by law
to stay in the house
if you remain cooperative.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.308
I'm a firefighter.
Station 51.

16:58.476 --> 17:03.605
My fiancée is a doctor at
Lakeshore. Do we really look
like cocaine users to you?

17:03.773 --> 17:06.233
If you could please both go
wait in the front room.

17:10.822 --> 17:11.822
Now.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.700
Antonio Dawson.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.829
He's a detective in Vice.
He'll tell you we're being
harassed by this cop.

17:19.872 --> 17:24.292
I have Antonio's number on my
cell. Will you please just
take a second and talk to him?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.883
Please.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.937
Yeah, this is
Officer Madden...

17:44.939 --> 17:47.357
Yeah, we had a search
warrant for Matthew Casey...

17:47.525 --> 17:50.902
It's all right, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.326
He says they're clean.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.458
If I ever have to come back
here again, no favor is gonna
get you out of it.

18:16.721 --> 18:17.846
It was under the table.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.565
Oh, my God.
That's 15 years right there.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.358
Call Antonio back.
Flush it down the toilet.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.152
Baby...
Flush it down the toilet!

18:49.212 --> 18:50.212
Matt!

19:12.235 --> 19:14.069
You just committed
a couple of felonies.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.946
I'm ready to commit
a few more.

19:16.113 --> 19:21.117
Because I'm telling you,
it ends now, or you're the one
that's gonna disappear.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.921
Yeah, I can respect that.

19:50.773 --> 19:54.401
Go ahead. Use it.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.031
You retract that
statement against my son,

20:04.161 --> 20:05.537
or you pull that trigger,

20:08.708 --> 20:10.417
'cause that's the only thing
that's gonna stop me.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.625
Muffled heart sounds.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.918
It was clearly Beck's triad.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.880
She had a sternal fracture,
a large hemopericardium
and mediastinal hemorrhage,

20:57.048 --> 20:59.007
all of which indicate that
a periocardiostentesis
was obviously...

20:59.175 --> 21:00.967
You're already
talking too much.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.887
The question was,
what did you see?

21:05.056 --> 21:08.016
Uh, I saw a young girl
in danger of dying.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.144
And so I felt it
was necessary to...
Feelings. No feelings.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.605
Thoughts. Convictions.
Okay, fine.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.607
I thought that...

21:17.693 --> 21:21.571
I knew that I had to do
something immediately,

21:21.739 --> 21:22.697
and that something was...

21:22.865 --> 21:25.492
Just answer the
question posed to you.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.410
Don't elaborate.

21:27.578 --> 21:28.745
And smile.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.164
Fine
Go ahead.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.709
What?
Smile. Let me see it.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.045
Oh, Mouch, come on.
I can smile.
Let me see it.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.548
Come on.
Contrite, not smug,

21:40.716 --> 21:43.093
welcoming and innocent.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.934
We're gonna work on that.

21:54.772 --> 21:55.939
I'm hittin
the rack, boys.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.400
Yeah, 'cause
you're getting buried.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.114
Uh oh.
Not all good.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.657
How you know?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.034
That's an "I'm with the
program" kind of walk.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.300
You were right.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.387
Voight had me spun out.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.805
I let it get to me.

22:29.932 --> 22:30.932
Won't let it again

22:33.227 --> 22:34.769
I'm ready to work.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.229
I'm willing to
trust the system.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.026
So I'd like resume
my duties, Chief.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.871
Welcome back.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.424
Hey, hey!
There he is! Huh?

23:04.592 --> 23:06.676
All right,
all right!

23:06.844 --> 23:08.344
Don't turn it into
a Greek wedding.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.305
Come on, everybody.
Normal day.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.307
Everybody go about
your business. Let's go.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.900
Truck 81, Engine 51,

23:22.068 --> 23:23.902
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.029
Building fire,
Indiana and 28th Place.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.024
Hey, Chief.
Dumpster fire,
nobody called it in.

24:03.192 --> 24:06.027
The flames went up the
service elevator shaft,
spread out on the fifth.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.862
Find me the super,
I need occupancy numbers.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.781
What about the
main elevators?
Otis just cleared it.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.658
He's coming out with
a few more tenants.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.077
Right.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.460
Five more Ambo's
and Chief Hatcher's
on the way.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.838
We're gonna need 'em.
We anticipate at least
five reds in there.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.631
We can't wait for Hatcher
with this many
non-responses.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.092
We've gotta
set up triage.
Do it.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.677
You're in charge here.

24:33.764 --> 24:34.764
All right.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.518
This is Ambulance 61.
Give me an EMS Plan 1...

24:38.686 --> 24:40.228
Hey, Chief...
She'll be fine.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.522
I know, but where
are all the people?

24:42.690 --> 24:44.774
No one's coming out
of the other side
of the building.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.569
Squad 3, check out the
west side fire stairwell.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.196
Already on three,
must be a blockage.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.115
Capp and Hadley
have the east.
I'm sending you

24:52.283 --> 24:54.742
Casey, Cruz and Mills.
We need to check out
those upper floors.

24:54.910 --> 24:55.910
On it.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.415
You're kidding me.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.835
You all right?
Yeah.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.212
Severide!

25:06.380 --> 25:07.755
Yeah, I'm clearing a path.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.973
Hey, is there
anybody back there?

25:17.141 --> 25:19.517
Hey!
Hurry,
they can't breathe.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.895
It's pitch black in there,
there's people in the hall.

25:22.062 --> 25:25.982
If you're mobile,
keep walking.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.651
Slow and steady.
There's paramedics waiting.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.614
Hey, I'll take this.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.407
I'm goin' up further.
Okay.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.177
I've got at least four
reds heading to triage.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.515
All right, we got another red.
Shay, this one's yours.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.767
Yeah, got it.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.187
All right.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.314
Help me.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.485
There's three
more up on six.
Any burns?

26:10.653 --> 26:12.612
Not on Six, but Casey,
Cruz and Mills went higher.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.197
All right.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.866
Capp, Hadley, meet us
in the west stairwell.
Copy.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.034
You're going in there?

26:19.620 --> 26:22.664
You need to get
back behind the lines.
Mouch, get this kid safe.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.831
Come here, pal.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.835
You gotta get that
tube down her throat.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.463
I can't, there's
too much swelling.
Then cric her.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.423
I've never done it.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.968
Dawson! You gotta
cric this woman
or she's a goner.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.477
All right,
hand me a scalpel.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.693
Who's the lead here?
You're looking at her.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.278
You may as well keep
looking over my shoulder,

26:53.445 --> 26:54.904
'cause this is definitely
gonna be an infraction.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.744
Give me a size five tube.

27:07.751 --> 27:08.751
Bag.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.136
All right, bag her.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.016
Lungs are good.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.517
Get me the fastest
driver we got!

27:24.685 --> 27:25.935
Next available
ambulance, now.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.438
Copy that. All right,
16, respond to triage.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.192
Seven is clear.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.863
Casey is on eight.
I got it.
I'm on my way up!

27:45.247 --> 27:47.498
Fire department! All out!

27:53.756 --> 27:55.298
Come on!

27:56.425 --> 27:57.508
Come on.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.762
No, Casey!

28:00.929 --> 28:02.764
Retreat! Go back.
You won't make it.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.266
Retreat,
you won't make it!

28:05.434 --> 28:06.976
Get back in
the apartment!

28:07.144 --> 28:08.978
Casey, go on!

28:10.731 --> 28:11.731
Get down!

28:14.860 --> 28:16.736
Casey plus two on eight.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.654
East corner unit.
Move that ladder now!

28:20.616 --> 28:22.241
Mayday!

28:23.285 --> 28:26.329
Mayday!
Not sure how long
I can hold it back.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.798
Eight is a reach.
No choice.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.216
Get that ladder as
close as you can,

28:38.384 --> 28:40.218
hug the building
if you have to,
Capp and I'll find him.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.220
I need a clear path
to the east corner.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.388
Okay, let's make a path.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.058
What's your name?
Curtis.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.561
Okay, Curtis. You need
to put that on her.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.605
Make sure it's tight
around her face.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.485
All right, now I want
you to open the window.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.197
We ain't
gonna make it.
Open it.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.792
We're gonna have three
coming down from eight.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.212
I need two ambulance crews
ready at the base of Truck 81.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.596
We're coming
for you, Casey.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.681
Better make it fast!

29:26.849 --> 29:28.391
It's gettin' hot in here.

29:28.559 --> 29:32.645
All right, tell 'em to
stand in three, two, one!

29:32.813 --> 29:34.897
All right,
Curtis get your mom up!

29:35.065 --> 29:36.983
Come on,
you go first.

29:39.403 --> 29:42.155
Okay, come on out.
Turn around.

29:51.957 --> 29:52.999
Capp, take her!

29:54.168 --> 29:55.168
Hang on.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.880
Slow step backwards...

30:01.633 --> 30:03.801
Come on!
Not until
he's out!

30:04.636 --> 30:05.636
Let's go.

30:07.848 --> 30:08.848
Argh!

30:13.812 --> 30:15.897
All right,
your turn!
No way,

30:16.064 --> 30:17.565
not until you're
out of range!

30:17.733 --> 30:20.067
I'm not movin'.
Let go now!

30:20.235 --> 30:21.319
All right, here I come!

30:21.487 --> 30:23.696
All right. Hang on,
keep your head down.

30:36.752 --> 30:37.752
I can't...

30:38.962 --> 30:40.379
I can't get up.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.049
Hey...

30:45.052 --> 30:46.677
Grab my...

30:46.845 --> 30:47.845
Grab my arm!

30:48.889 --> 30:50.848
Swing.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.273
Come on. I got ya.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.038
Capp.
Thanks, Chief.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.206
Hadley...

31:15.374 --> 31:16.332
Chief.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.084
Good job.
Chief.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.592
That was pretty
close, huh?

31:27.636 --> 31:29.971
- Plenty of time.
- Really?

31:33.308 --> 31:34.976
Listen,

31:35.143 --> 31:38.646
if you see Hallie at
the hospital, don't tell
her about this, okay?

31:38.814 --> 31:40.523
I've given her enough
to worry about lately.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.774
Yeah.

31:41.942 --> 31:43.568
Hey, Chief says
you should hit it

31:43.735 --> 31:44.944
so you can make
it to your hearing.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.447
Who's gonna cover?
EMT certified.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.199
Good luck.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.495
Yeah, good luck.

31:54.663 --> 31:55.663
Yeah, okay.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.583
Take care of
your mom, okay?

32:03.672 --> 32:06.132
Hey, you Casey?

32:06.967 --> 32:07.967
Yeah.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.186
You the one got the problem
with Detective Voight, right?

32:22.149 --> 32:23.149
Yeah, that's right.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.613
Man, I can help you out.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.290
Curtis is gonna do it.
When? Where?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.709
Now. He already put in a
call to Voight for a meet.

32:42.753 --> 32:43.836
I'm gonna prep him while
my techs wire him up,

32:44.004 --> 32:45.546
then we're good to go.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.256
Now, we got
one shot at this.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.216
There's about a dozen
things that could flush
it down the drain,

32:49.384 --> 32:50.635
so, don't say
anything to anyone.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.802
Don't even mention
his name out loud,

32:51.970 --> 32:53.554
'cause Voight's got
ears all over this city.

32:54.431 --> 32:55.598
I'll let you know
once it goes down.

32:55.766 --> 32:56.766
I want to be there.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.816
Fine, let's go.

33:13.075 --> 33:15.701
The charges you face,
Miss Dawson, are both
very serious

33:15.869 --> 33:17.036
and very troubling.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.288
We disagree
wholeheartedly, sir.

33:19.456 --> 33:22.333
Miss Dawson chose to
perform a procedure
that was clearly

33:22.501 --> 33:24.085
outside of her jurisdiction

33:24.252 --> 33:26.796
and that could've
mortally injured the
patient in her care.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.798
Uh...

33:28.965 --> 33:30.132
To refresh my memory,

33:30.300 --> 33:34.679
could you please read
the full charges out loud?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.055
I believe we
have that right.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.518
Gabriela Dawson is
charged with willful
neglect of protocol

33:40.686 --> 33:42.144
and of practicing
a medical procedure

33:42.312 --> 33:44.230
that she was neither
trained nor certified...

33:44.398 --> 33:45.606
No, I have been trained
in that procedure,

33:45.774 --> 33:46.982
and I knew exactly
what I was doing

33:47.150 --> 33:48.693
and how much time
we didn't have.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.778
I'm also currently
taking pre-med classes

33:50.946 --> 33:52.738
where I've re-studied
every procedure...
I'm sorry...

33:52.906 --> 33:56.242
And I am studying for
my pilot's license,
Miss Dawson,

33:56.410 --> 33:59.203
but that does not
mean I can land a
747 in a blizzard.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.996
But you'd sure as hell
try if you were about to crash.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.541
You are lucky that girl
is alive or there would be

34:03.709 --> 34:05.084
criminal charges
pending against you.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.962
If saving a kid's life
is now a criminal offense

34:08.130 --> 34:10.005
then maybe it's your
damn protocol is out
of whack,

34:10.173 --> 34:11.882
and the wrong people
are making the rules.

34:17.806 --> 34:18.848
Ten minute break?

34:20.308 --> 34:21.475
Five.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.145
You didn't even
remember the charges.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.689
I was stalling for time.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.483
What? Why?

34:29.651 --> 34:30.651
We're ready.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.155
Ah.

34:35.115 --> 34:36.657
Hey, Madeline!

34:36.825 --> 34:38.117
I'm sorry,
are we too late?

34:38.285 --> 34:43.581
Uh, please enter into
the record witnesses
number two, three and four.

34:48.587 --> 34:52.047
There's a reason skydivers
pack two parachutes.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.028
Here we go.

35:28.502 --> 35:30.628
What's happenin',
Youngblood?
What's up, D.V?

35:33.215 --> 35:35.508
DeShawn says there's
money to be made on
the firefighter.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.675
I want his deal.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.261
He tell you who it is?

35:39.429 --> 35:40.721
Yeah, but I really wasn't
really paying attention

35:40.889 --> 35:42.014
'til he said something
about the money.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.017
His name is Casey.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.020
How much?

35:48.188 --> 35:50.481
Depends on
services rendered.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.775
DeShawn said his boys
got five for jumpin' him.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.070
Figure I could do
a lot worse for a grand.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.156
Bro, you stop him for
good, I'll give you two.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.741
We got it?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.785
Movin' in.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.664
They ain't here for me, bro.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.961
Let me see
your hands. Come on,
get 'em up.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.130
Yeah, look at me.

36:20.762 --> 36:21.762
I got him. I got him.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.814
Enjoy it while you can.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.024
This is entrapment.

36:35.277 --> 36:37.403
You're cooked,
Youngblood.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.666
Got it.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.209
Oh, that's great.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.377
That's great to hear.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.630
Yeah, okay. See you
at the shindig. Bye.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.009
That was Mouch.
Dawson got a three
shift suspension.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.469
But we'll be throwing
her a suspension party
tomorrow night.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.763
So how much money
does she lose?
Like, two grand?

37:04.931 --> 37:05.973
A little bit more,

37:06.141 --> 37:08.559
but if we all chip in
twenty bucks we might be
able to put a dent in it.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.853
Or...

37:19.446 --> 37:20.863
It's got that signature
wild style of his,

37:21.031 --> 37:23.824
and has this lovely
unfinished quality to it.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.743
He almost fell to his death
while finishing the "O.'

37:27.787 --> 37:29.997
Unbelievable.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.498
Can you hold on one second?

37:31.666 --> 37:32.833
Thanks, pal.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.169
Hello? Hey, Serge,
how are ya?

37:35.337 --> 37:36.837
Listen, I'm gonna have
to give you a call back,

37:37.005 --> 37:39.465
I'm on the other line
with a different buyer,

37:39.633 --> 37:42.509
but if he starts
dragging his feet,
it's all yours, buddy.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.595
All right, thanks pal.

37:44.763 --> 37:45.763
Hello?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.557
All right, two thousand.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.727
Fifteen hundred.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.437
You're gonna slap me
in the face like that?

37:53.605 --> 37:54.855
You're gonna slap me in
the face with one thousand?

37:55.023 --> 37:56.982
You...

37:57.150 --> 37:58.150
I'll take it.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.112
What's this?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.614
Just drink it.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.369
Congrats to Dawson.
It could've been worse.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.330
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:11.498 --> 38:12.498
Mmm.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.794
Oh!
Shiver me timbers.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.175
Thank you so much
for your help, Mouch.
You really pulled it out.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.887
You weren't worried
about me, were ya?

38:27.722 --> 38:28.722
No, no. Never.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.729
Thomas Kinkade.
Okay, I get that.

38:35.897 --> 38:39.149
I mean, you look
at his paintings,
God rest his soul,

38:39.317 --> 38:42.486
but yeah, that's art.
That's worth money.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.405
But this...

38:44.572 --> 38:47.282
The scourge of a
civilized society, man.

38:48.410 --> 38:52.162
Chain O' Lakes, guys.
Chain O' Lakes, that's
where you'll find me.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.330
Hello?

38:54.499 --> 38:56.834
Okay, great.
We'll bring it right out.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.462
That's the buyer.
He's here.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.881
Grab an end.
I'm not touchin' it.

39:05.218 --> 39:06.218
Chain O' Lakes.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.555
Hey, guys,
I'll help you.
No, thanks, Dawson.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.190
I'm not gonna ask.
I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.

39:20.358 --> 39:23.360
I would have thrown
the book at you.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.612
Hi.
Hi.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.780
Hey.
Hey.

39:26.948 --> 39:27.948
I heard about Voight.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.284
Had it worse
than me, huh?

39:30.452 --> 39:33.704
Rear view mirror, baby.
Rear view mirror.

39:33.872 --> 39:34.913
Well, then, you've come
to the right place.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.541
You can see my friend
Peter Mills at the bar
over there.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.085
Oh yeah,
you did an okay job.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.212
Oh, thanks.
What a ball-breaker, huh?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.547
You can handle it.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.383
Any chance
Voight beats this?
No shot.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.760
Speaking of shots,
where are they?

39:48.762 --> 39:49.762
Over there.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.808
Where's Hallie?
Meeting me here.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.813
I'm really
happy for you.
You too.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.903
Hey, come here.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.321
All right.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.782
I am glad it is over.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.533
It is.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.619
Thanks for
everything, Chief.
Pff.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.332
Are you drunk, Chief?

40:20.210 --> 40:21.877
Yeah, a little.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.338
I'll be joining
you momentarily.
Good, glad to hear it.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.509
Just ask him.
You.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.635
He'll think I'm
sniffing around.

40:29.803 --> 40:31.261
How do you think I'm
gonna come across?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.429
Here he comes.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.556
He thinks I'm
a curmudgeon.
Would you just
do it for me?

40:35.850 --> 40:36.892
Peter Mills.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.103
Hey, Lieutenant.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.814
What's up?
Great party. Thank you
for hosting it.

40:41.981 --> 40:45.484
Yeah. No sweat.
And it's a really
cool space.

40:45.652 --> 40:46.819
And what kind of food
do you guys serve?

40:47.904 --> 40:50.989
Well, it's a diner,
so, diner food.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.282
Oh, hey, uh...

40:53.535 --> 40:55.786
Is your sister,
Elise, here tonight?

40:58.164 --> 41:00.374
No. She's out
with some friends.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.459
Oh, all right.

41:08.633 --> 41:09.633
Thanks.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.516
Cheers.
Cheers.

41:21.688 --> 41:22.813
Oh, Hallie's here.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.608
Hey.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.279
It's over.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.614
We're all right now.
