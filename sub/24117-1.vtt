<i>Come on, step up.</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:36.158
<i>Ladies,

00:38.040 --> 00:39.315
<i>Let's see those

Five.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.513
- Nicole.
- What?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.273
How long are you gonna
frost that thing for?

02:49.480 --> 02:51.676
I just want to make sure
that the icing is perfect

02:51.680 --> 02:53.399
so the canvas
on which to paint...

02:53.400 --> 02:55.198
It's a sheet cake.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.395
Sheet cakes
are not supposed to..

02:56.560 --> 02:58.438
Have you been
to a church bake off?

02:58.440 --> 03:00.033
Listen, at least you can
eat this cake, okay?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.800
I like the cake I made.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.997
- You are a diabetic.
- And?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.037
And it was full of sugar.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.794
<i>You remember
to take your pills?</i>

03:10.000 --> 03:11.753
- I don't think I did.
- I don't think you did either.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.513
- No.
- Go on.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.596
Hello.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.478
<i>Oh, no. Okay.</i>

03:21.480 --> 03:22.197
Mm-hmm.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.879
Alright, thank you.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.711
What's the matter?

03:26.760 --> 03:28.114
That's work.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.759
I gotta go in
early today.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.833
- Today?
- Yeah.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.832
But it's my birthday.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.716
Alrighty.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.193
Come on. Fork it over.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.597
<i>Come on.</i>

03:58.960 --> 04:00.394
<i>Anderson!</i>

04:00.400 --> 04:01.799
<i>You going
to your meeting?</i>

04:01.800 --> 04:03.200
- Oh, yeah. On my way.
- Alright. Okay.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.273
- One step at a time.
- Have a good night!

04:12.120 --> 04:12.951
<i>There's two cakes
back there.</i>

04:12.960 --> 04:13.996
<i>Excelente.</i>

04:14.160 --> 04:15.276
<i>And you like the food?</i>

04:15.280 --> 04:16.759
<i>Yeah. This is good, mom.</i>

04:16.760 --> 04:20.036
Well, there you go.
There you go.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.269
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey!

04:21.279 --> 04:22.350
I have to go.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.954
I don't know
how you do it.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.440
<i>Being a part
of the brutal mass</i>

04:25.600 --> 04:27.353
<i>incarceration system.</i>

04:27.360 --> 04:28.999
Imagine how much more
brutal it would be

04:29.200 --> 04:30.714
if I wasn't working in it?

04:31.680 --> 04:32.796
I know I couldn't do it.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.279
Don't eat off his plate.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.396
Momma,
I don't have a plate.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.517
I'll make you a plate,
do you want a plate?

04:38.520 --> 04:39.954
Ma, she's getting ready
to go.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.070
Love you, sis.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.197
Love you too.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.033
- Love you, Junior. Bye.
- Bye.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.839
We'll save you some cake.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.992
Okay.
Save me a piece of both.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.115
You gonna win
that karaoke contest.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.114
Aahh hoo-ah hoo-aah!
Hoo-ha oh!

05:07.160 --> 05:08.479
<i>Stevens!</i>

05:08.480 --> 05:10.870
Oh, uh, you wanted
to see me, warden?

05:11.080 --> 05:13.675
Come here, sit down.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.275
Stevens, how would you
like the opportunity

05:16.280 --> 05:17.714
to prove yourself?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.079
Sir?

05:20.080 --> 05:22.549
Listen, Stevens,
first thing tomorrow

05:22.560 --> 05:24.631
I need you to escort
a prisoner on a death bed

05:24.640 --> 05:26.677
visit downstate.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.718
I appreciate it, sir,
but I don't think

05:28.720 --> 05:29.710
that I can get away
on such short notice

05:29.720 --> 05:30.995
I'm sorry.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.311
I recall you saying
you were trying to get

05:33.320 --> 05:34.800
a full time position here.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.439
Yeah, I did.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.150
Well, let's use this as an
opportunity to prove it.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.594
Uh, yeah. Okay.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.877
Yes! Excellent!

05:48.040 --> 05:49.952
Stevens, I knew
you'd come through for me.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.189
First thing tomorrow.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.079
Get out of here.
See you tomorrow.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.478
Come here
and lie beside me.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.954
Anderson,
warden wants to see you.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.230
Why? What's going on?

06:32.400 --> 06:34.119
How the heck do I know?

06:34.120 --> 06:35.918
You can ask him yourself.
Get up.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.914
Uh, Anderson, there's no,
oh, easy way to say this

06:41.080 --> 06:43.072
but your mother is dying.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.271
Oh, man. That's too bad.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.153
Well, she only
has a short time left

06:49.320 --> 06:50.959
and she requested
to see you.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.273
I don't know,
I... kinda stuck here.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.158
Well, we sometimes
grant emergency furlough

06:57.320 --> 06:58.913
in situations like this.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.197
Oh, you mean like
a deathbed visit?

07:02.200 --> 07:05.398
<i>More like a supervised
36 hour release.</i>

07:07.680 --> 07:08.875
Thirty-six hours?

07:18.240 --> 07:19.993
Nicole,
what are you doing up?

07:20.160 --> 07:22.755
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.360
I got a special detail.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.318
I have to escort
a prisoner downstate.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.199
I will be gone
for 36 hours.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.618
I'm gonna be here
by myself for 36 hours?

07:30.619 --> 07:32.877
I already laid out
all your medication.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.997
You know, I have things
I have to do

07:35.000 --> 07:36.798
at the library.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.997
Okay, well, maybe you can
ask Brandy to take you.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.673
Brandy's not gonna..
She's a terrible driver..

07:40.840 --> 07:42.513
- I don't understand...
- Mom.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.113
The warden says
that if I do a good job

07:44.280 --> 07:45.794
he might get me
a permanent position

07:45.800 --> 07:48.952
which I have been trying
to get, without any luck.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.838
You're going
with somebody dangerous.

07:50.840 --> 07:54.038
You putting
yourself in danger.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.874
I mean, t... technically,
she is a prisoner, momma.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.836
But no, and besides

07:58.000 --> 07:59.070
<i>she's gonna be
all chained up.</i>

07:59.080 --> 08:01.311
Well, what are you
doing exactly?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.518
I am taking her
on a deathbed visit.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.160
- A deathbed visit?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

08:06.320 --> 08:08.118
To see her mother.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.190
Oh.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.954
- Her momma's dyin'?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

08:11.960 --> 08:13.360
And you're
taking her down?

08:13.520 --> 08:15.034
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- Thirty-six hours?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.396
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- What if I die?

08:17.600 --> 08:18.795
I could.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.314
I don't wanna
scare you but..

08:22.880 --> 08:24.314
Momma..

08:24.520 --> 08:26.159
- Please be careful.
- I will.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.750
Go back to sleep, momma.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.950
Okay. Stay up
and write your will.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.280
I'm not feedin'
that damn fish.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.714
You better feed that fish.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.198
- Stevens.
- Oh.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.353
Oh, God. It's heavy.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.238
What is she in for again?

08:47.240 --> 08:50.392
- Armed robbery.
- Right.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.959
<i>The judge sentenced her</i>

08:51.960 --> 08:53.189
<i>to a mandatory eight.</i>

08:53.360 --> 08:55.795
<i>She's getting off early
on good time served.</i>

08:55.800 --> 08:58.793
God, she's got
a lot of priors.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.870
Look, don't you worry
about that.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.950
Just do your job.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.759
She's in the program,
she's clean.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.719
Yeah.
Yeah, she seems it.

09:05.880 --> 09:06.870
There you go.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.394
Do I get a weapon, sir?

09:12.560 --> 09:14.631
Oh, yes.
You do get a weapon.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.680
A service revolver.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.954
- You get that.
- Oh, Taser. Wow.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.474
- Some of this.
- Oh, pepper spray.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.312
I have got that.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.675
Good for you.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.916
Is that all?

09:30.080 --> 09:30.991
What, you want a tank,
Stevens?

09:31.160 --> 09:32.560
It's not
the zombie apocalypse.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.076
Right. Uh, any advice?

09:35.080 --> 09:36.355
Oh. Yes.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.712
Don't turn your back
on the prisoner.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.075
Don't let the prisoner
out of your sight.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.232
And whatever she says,
don't believe it.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.760
Right, okay.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.958
Thank you.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.394
You're gonna do fine,
Stevens.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.234
Yeah.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.919
<i>Right cown here.</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:03.550
There we go.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.112
Inmate, turn around.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.474
I am CO Stevens

10:09.640 --> 10:10.710
and I will be
your emergency

10:10.720 --> 10:12.518
furlough escort.
Give me your hands.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.037
You are in my custody
and you'll follow

10:18.200 --> 10:20.396
my orders
without question.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.679
Alright?

10:23.680 --> 10:25.194
Whatever you say,
Officer Stevens.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.556
To the bench.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.676
No, no,
don't sit on the bench

10:28.680 --> 10:30.672
just turn around
and face the wall.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.235
Alright.
Away from the wall.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.791
I have the authority,
at my discretion

10:43.800 --> 10:45.029
to terminate this leave
at any time.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.760
- Is that clear, Anderson?
- Very clear, CO Stevens.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.957
For the next 36 hours..

10:51.360 --> 10:53.352
...I own you.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.035
Let me see your eyes
so I know you understand.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.034
I just wanna go
see my mother. Hm?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.475
Anything you say goes.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.395
Good.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.516
Can we go now?

11:03.720 --> 11:04.995
No, you don't tell me
when to go.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.913
I tell you when to go,
that's the orders thing

11:07.080 --> 11:09.390
you follow them,
I have to give them first.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.478
Okay?

11:12.920 --> 11:13.990
Okay, let's go.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.876
<i>This way.</i>

11:24.160 --> 11:24.911
Alright. Go.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.674
Stop here.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.477
Here.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.589
Alright.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.953
Alrighty. No, I got it.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.236
Here I come.
I'm okay, I can get out.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.435
- I... I can get that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.671
- Wait a minute!
- Alright.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.230
Aw, man. It's beautiful.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.153
- Thank you!
- Alright.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.195
Hey! Hi, boy!

12:36.520 --> 12:37.715
That lady has handcuffs!

12:37.880 --> 12:39.394
Aw, don't be afraid,
don't be worried

12:39.400 --> 12:40.390
there's nothing
to be worried about.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.232
Come on.
No funny business.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.390
Not from me.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.360
Okay.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.715
- Whoa! No, no.
- Okay.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.439
What's... what's
going on here?

12:52.600 --> 12:53.829
I... I don't, I really don't want
any trouble on my bus.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.035
Well, there's not
gonna be any.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.475
- Um..
- Here you go.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.393
I see handcuffs, leg shackles,
prison uniforms..

12:58.600 --> 12:59.590
Kinda smells like
trouble to me.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.194
Yeah, I'm a
corrections officer

13:01.400 --> 13:02.959
and she's in my custody.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.954
Look, uh, Nicole Stevens

13:05.960 --> 13:07.758
I'm the captain
of this ship, okay?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.070
I'm the captain.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.992
That means my only
priority is the safety

13:11.160 --> 13:13.072
of my passengers
and of myself.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.958
Okay, captain, but there's
nothing to be afraid of.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.552
I'm not afraid of nothin',

13:15.760 --> 13:16.989
I just don't like the
looks of your passenger.

13:17.160 --> 13:17.593
Oh, come on.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.393
Don't judge a book
by its cover, mister.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.516
- What?
- I'm not, it's not...

13:20.520 --> 13:22.432
Okay, that's it.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.635
You're not boarding!

13:23.640 --> 13:24.960
Oh, God.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.271
Well, it's the law.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.270
You have to let us board.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.274
The law? On this ship
I'm the law.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.875
We are on official
New York State business, sir.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.200
We're on a deathbed
visit here.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.716
- Time is of the essence.
- Who's dying?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.679
- My mother.
- Oh, your mother?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.000
Where does she live,
'cause I could go

13:42.160 --> 13:43.560
pick her up
and bring her back to you.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.399
Listen, this is no time
for jokes

13:45.400 --> 13:47.392
this is serious business.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.517
<i>I have no desire
to cause trouble.</i>

13:49.720 --> 13:51.439
I... I... I just
wanna go see my mother.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.199
Look, mister,
you got a mother, right?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.714
Yes, I have a mother.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.315
So I got a mother too.
She's asked to see me.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.436
You gonna stop me
from seeing her?

13:58.600 --> 14:02.116
Please, mister, please,
let me on your bus.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.677
Alright, listen. You stay
on your best behavior.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.034
You keep her locked up
the entire time...

14:09.040 --> 14:09.951
I mean that's part
of the thing.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.514
- Get on the bus.
- Okay.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.830
Thank you so much.
That was so good of you.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.239
- So, so good of you.
- Get on the bus.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.471
- Very thoughtful.
- You know, okay. Alright.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.074
<i>I don't think
I can get on that step.</i>

14:18.080 --> 14:19.753
<i>Like, maybe push..
That's it, Got..</i>

14:21.280 --> 14:23.397
Jesus Christ.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.835
Next time I'll do
the talking, okay?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.400
- Oh, you got it.
- But thanks.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.711
- You did a good job.
- Yeah, okay.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.837
Why do we have
to take this shitty bus?

14:30.840 --> 14:32.718
'Cause the limousine
wasn't available.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.632
Where do you wanna sit,
huh?

14:34.800 --> 14:35.870
- Where, here?
- Yeah.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.155
- This one's good.
- Alright.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.834
- We'll take this one, alright?
- Yeah, that's fine.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.631
Hot damn!

14:53.120 --> 14:54.713
We're gonna have
a good time.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.070
<i>Welcome aboard,
passengers.</i>

15:10.240 --> 15:11.674
<i>A few, uh,
quick announcements</i>

15:11.840 --> 15:13.274
<i>and safety procedures.</i>

15:13.440 --> 15:14.954
<i>This is a
no smoking ride.</i>

15:15.120 --> 15:16.839
<i>Turn your
cell phones off.</i>

15:17.000 --> 15:18.753
<i>Please don't move around
the cabin.</i>

15:18.920 --> 15:21.674
<i>Don't bother me,
I'm the driver.</i>

15:21.840 --> 15:23.399
<i>You don't want me
to be distractec.</i>

15:23.400 --> 15:26.950
<i>Just general manners are
appreciated. Thank you.</i>

15:32.600 --> 15:33.795
<i>That's crazy.</i>

15:42.440 --> 15:43.920
No phone calls
on the bus, ma'am.

15:43.921 --> 15:46.515
I'll answer it.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.512
<i>- Hello, Nicole?</i>
- Hi, I'm working.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.000
- You okay?
<i>- Honey.</i>

15:50.160 --> 15:52.231
Where are the
Multi-Grain Waffles?

15:52.240 --> 15:54.914
- The frozen ones?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

15:55.080 --> 15:57.675
Yeah. In the freezer,
where else, mom?

15:57.680 --> 15:59.034
No, they're not
in the freezer

15:59.040 --> 16:00.315
I'm looking
I... I don't see them.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.920
You sure, they're
in the yellow box

16:02.080 --> 16:03.639
remember, they switched
the box colors?

16:03.800 --> 16:04.950
- It's yellow now.
<i>- I remember that.</i>

16:05.120 --> 16:07.112
I remember that,
they're not in here.

16:07.320 --> 16:07.753
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>

16:07.960 --> 16:09.314
<i>There were some
right when I left.</i>

16:09.320 --> 16:11.960
Well, they're not
in here now, Nicole.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.032
<i>Now, I... I need them
to keep regular.</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:15.997
Well, what about
the bran cereal.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.759
<i>You can try that.</i>

16:17.760 --> 16:20.514
I don't like bran cereal,
where are the waffles!

16:20.680 --> 16:21.591
Well, why don't you have
Brandy

16:21.800 --> 16:22.677
go and pick
you up some then?

16:22.840 --> 16:24.797
<i>Brandy is not here.</i>

16:25.000 --> 16:26.639
Listen,
I had a whole plan.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.234
I was gonna get
the waffles

16:28.400 --> 16:29.800
I was gonna make 'em

16:29.960 --> 16:31.279
I was gonna put syrup on 'em

16:31.280 --> 16:34.557
and some butter, and just
have a pleasant day.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.479
Okay, I understand

16:36.480 --> 16:39.040
but I'm working here,
I gotta go, moms.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.440
Love you, okay? Bye.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.633
Who's paying
for this trip?

16:58.200 --> 16:59.998
My understanding is that
the inmate pays for it.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.195
So, you.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.157
That's a great rule

17:03.160 --> 17:04.355
but I don't know
how I'm gonna do that

17:04.359 --> 17:05.680
at 22 cents an hour.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.275
Well, your mom
must really wanna see you.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.239
Hi, Brandy.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.198
Who the hell do you think
you are running off

17:37.200 --> 17:38.190
and dumping moms in my lap

17:38.360 --> 17:39.430
without even
saying a word!

17:39.440 --> 17:41.397
Okay, well,
I had an emergency

17:41.560 --> 17:42.516
come up at work,
so I didn't really

17:42.520 --> 17:43.715
have a choice.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.030
And you didn't even
have the courtesy

17:45.200 --> 17:46.270
to pick up the telephone

17:46.280 --> 17:48.078
and give me
a goddamn call?

17:48.080 --> 17:50.993
<i>I didn't wanna
wake you up.</i>

17:51.000 --> 17:52.719
When are you coming back?

17:52.720 --> 17:55.554
- Sunday night.
<i>- Suncay night?</i>

17:55.560 --> 17:56.880
Yeah.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.520
So who's gonna take her
to her volunteer thing

17:58.521 --> 17:59.670
at the library?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.240
I guess you will
just have to take her.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.999
You know what, Nicole?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.673
Don't you dare ever
try to pull a stunt on me

18:06.840 --> 18:07.876
like this again!
You hear me?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.633
- Uh, okay.
<i>- Ever.</i>

18:09.800 --> 18:11.029
Bye, Brandy.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.636
Who's Brandy?

18:21.800 --> 18:23.632
She is my sister.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.310
- You got sisters?
- No, I'm an only child.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.390
You're lucky.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.598
I wish I had a sister.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.080
You kidding me?

18:38.480 --> 18:39.550
Yeah.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.037
<i>Excuse me.</i>

19:11.680 --> 19:12.909
Ugh! Jesus.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.472
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, sure.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.472
No, no, no, no.
I gotta go.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.199
Like, number one
or number two?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.920
I'm just asking.
How urgent is it?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.992
I gotta go.
I can't wait.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.435
Why didn't you go
before we left?

19:28.440 --> 19:30.955
I did, they served
mystery meat for breakfast

19:30.960 --> 19:32.553
and it comes out
when it wants to.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.113
Can I please just..

19:40.320 --> 19:41.436
...permission
to go to the bathroom?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.271
- Yeah. Okay.
- Please?

19:42.440 --> 19:44.033
Well, I gotta take you.
So. Come on.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.993
Jesus. Okay.
Alright, here I come.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.634
Thank you so much.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.792
Thank you so much,
you're not gonna regret this.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.950
Excuse me!
Thank you so much.

19:51.160 --> 19:51.991
Sorry. Comin' through.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.839
- Okay. You gotta undo the cuffs.
- What?

19:57.840 --> 19:59.320
I gotta get
the jumpsuit down.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.154
- Just, just undo one of 'em.
- No. He'll kick us off.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.518
- I am prairie doggin' it.
- You're what-ing it?

20:05.520 --> 20:07.398
You know when a prairie
dog sticks his head out of a hole?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.751
Oh, God! Alright, yep.
Alright. Thank you.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.798
Alright. Wa.. Wha... wha..
Alright, where're we goin'?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.519
We're going back
to the seat. Thank you.

20:14.760 --> 20:15.398
I'm so sorry.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.031
Alright, yes, ma'am.
Right away, ma'am.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.474
- Captain, we have a situation.
- What? What is it?

20:26.640 --> 20:30.031
My prisoner is having an
emergency of the number two variety

20:30.200 --> 20:31.634
she needs
to relieve herself.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.233
- Are you serious?
<i>- Yeah, number two.</i>

20:33.240 --> 20:35.118
Is there a way
that I can release her

20:35.120 --> 20:37.510
restraints so that she can
get her jumpsuit down?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.319
- Just one of 'em.
- No way you're unlocking her.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.915
- No way.
- Your choice.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.991
In minute you're gonna have
a real stinky mess

20:44.000 --> 20:44.797
on your hands, okay?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.320
So, ball's in your court.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.035
Please, please, please.
Please..

20:49.240 --> 20:50.196
<i>She's gotta go.</i>

20:52.520 --> 20:53.112
Uh..

20:55.320 --> 20:56.436
Attention passengers,

20:56.640 --> 20:58.996
uh, we are gonna have
to make a very quick

20:59.000 --> 21:00.957
unscheduled rest stop.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.874
You're gonna have exactly
ten minutes to do your business

21:04.040 --> 21:06.760
and if you don't
make it, uh, tough shit.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.791
- Thank you, thank you, sir.
- Thank you so much.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.553
<i>She's prairie dogging.</i>

21:12.720 --> 21:14.552
They call it, they call it a
turtle head where I come from.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.590
- I got it.
- Okay.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.035
Thank you.
Ah! What a relief.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.958
Hey, soldier boy.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.600
Seen any action lately?

21:46.760 --> 21:48.353
Well, I'm always
lookin' for action.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.397
But, honey, like you look
tied up right now.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.029
- I'm free in six months.
- Six months? It's a date.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.352
You see that?
I still got it. Yeah!

21:56.360 --> 21:57.271
- Uh-huh!
<i>- Six months!</i>

22:09.360 --> 22:11.238
<i>- Thank you so much.</i>
- Goodbye.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.471
- Good riddance.
- Thank you so so much.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.558
And I hope one day,
when you find yourself

22:15.720 --> 22:17.996
in trouble, you find
someone to be as kind

22:18.000 --> 22:19.195
to you
as you've been to me.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.270
- Okay.
<i>- Anderson!</i>

22:20.480 --> 22:21.470
Now, give my best
to your mother.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.198
Alright.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.753
Ah, I'm ready.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.515
<i>Feels good to be out
in the street, you know.</i>

22:31.520 --> 22:33.113
<i>Well, the train is coming
in ten minutes.</i>

22:33.120 --> 22:35.271
<i>Don't get used to it.</i>

22:40.000 --> 22:41.912
There's track trouble
so your train's gonna be

22:42.080 --> 22:43.480
delayed two hours.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.279
Okay, thank you.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.591
That's too bad.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.035
Listen, anything happens
to either one of us

22:51.040 --> 22:52.394
I'll meet you
right back here.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.196
Funny.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.840
No, really.
Are you hungry?

22:58.200 --> 22:59.839
We got some time.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.116
Yeah, I haven't eaten
since yesterday.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.555
I know a place nearby.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.559
Alright..

23:12.600 --> 23:14.592
Oh, goddammit,
these hurt.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.273
- What?
- Ow!

23:16.280 --> 23:19.478
Please, I need you
to stay closer, okay.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.470
I'm right here,
I'm right here..

23:20.640 --> 23:22.199
Wait, give me
a minute. Please.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.670
Give me a minute.
I just think that we're...

23:24.880 --> 23:25.916
I don't know.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.713
<i>You godcamn bastard,
try that again!</i>

23:31.880 --> 23:33.473
What happened?

23:33.680 --> 23:35.956
Tried to run off
with my lady's bag.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.316
- Oh!
- It's alright.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.590
- Thank you.
- Don't you worry.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.556
Alright,
just stay close, okay?

23:40.720 --> 23:43.394
Train station's
right down here, darlin'.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.153
It's a good thing
I'm here. Ow!

23:45.360 --> 23:46.555
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.596
No, I'm good.
It's just..

23:47.800 --> 23:49.393
Ow! Goddammit.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.114
I must've caught
some skin under that.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.910
- Come on.
- Really?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.752
Yeah. But you better not
make me regret this, okay?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.080
I'm not gonna make
you regret anything.

23:58.081 --> 23:59.309
We're gonna have
a great time.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.270
You got that one?

24:10.640 --> 24:13.280
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you so much!

24:13.440 --> 24:15.432
Alright, okay, okay.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.633
No, no, I... I'll be good,
I promise. I promise.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.792
- It was a high kick.
- That's all I got.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.115
Come to momma.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.717
Thank you!

24:50.640 --> 24:52.950
So, Stevens,
what do you think?

24:53.120 --> 24:55.077
Ah?

24:55.240 --> 24:56.276
It's kinda messy,
Anderson.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.874
Oh, thank you.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.995
You can call me Joan.
Huh.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.355
But how's it taste?

25:05.760 --> 25:08.992
- Not bad, Anderson.
- Can't do it, can you?

25:10.040 --> 25:11.440
I'd rather not.

25:13.920 --> 25:14.876
Oh, my God.

25:18.040 --> 25:18.951
Oh.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.479
It's dripping down
my sleeves here.

25:25.160 --> 25:28.358
Would you just maybe,
help me loosen one.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.359
I got six months.
I'm not going anywhere.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.836
- Yeah.
- Alrighty.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.832
So sweet, thank you.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.196
Oh, fantastic.
That's great.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.033
- There we are.
- That's great.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.633
Yeah, alright.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.394
- Come on, give me the other one.
- Really?

25:58.560 --> 25:59.994
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.510
You're too good to me.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.275
I know you're not
going anywhere.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.317
- I get to see my mom, right?
- Uh-huh.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.437
Mm-hmm.
Alright hold on.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.317
Here.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.035
They're going
right back on, okay?

26:17.720 --> 26:18.392
Absolutely!

26:20.400 --> 26:22.596
Now, I can eat
like a lady.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.196
Jesus!

26:41.120 --> 26:43.919
My mom's gonna freak
when she sees this crap.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.873
Oh, no, you look good.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.877
Yeah, well.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.833
You don't know my mother.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.918
She's the reason
I ended up like this.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.759
Sorry-ass, loser inmate.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.992
On my way to see her on
her deathbed with my CO.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.117
You think this is the way
I wanted my life to turn out?

27:04.360 --> 27:07.034
No. Probably not.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.350
But you can't really blame
your mom, can you?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.995
Oh, yes, I can,
she's a ballbuster.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.993
You know what
I'm talking about.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.914
Hi, mom.
I'm working now, okay?

27:21.920 --> 27:23.559
I can't talk.
I will call you later.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.155
My mother was so out of it

27:28.160 --> 27:31.471
she had me stuck
in a loony bin.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.994
But you were
a drug addict, no?

27:33.160 --> 27:36.551
Yeah, that's probably what
made a drug addict out of me.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.632
You know my mom actually
used to work in a mental hospital.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.036
I know those places
can be rough

27:41.200 --> 27:43.237
but I'm sure she thought she
was doing it for your own good.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.953
It's over now, you know?

27:49.960 --> 27:52.350
You learn a lot
about dysfunction

27:52.560 --> 27:55.792
co-dependency... you know.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.313
You gotta, you gotta
stand up for yourself.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.755
It's..

28:01.760 --> 28:03.717
- It's important.
- Yeah.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.030
Give me a minute.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.555
Moms, I am working.
What do you want?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.599
- Your sister is out of her mind.
- Ma..

28:10.760 --> 28:12.592
She won't help me,
I can't find anything

28:12.760 --> 28:14.194
I don't know
where anything is

28:14.360 --> 28:16.397
and she's just,
she's workin' me!

28:16.400 --> 28:17.390
Pull yourself together,
okay?

28:17.560 --> 28:20.917
I need you to lay down,
and calm down, alright?

28:21.080 --> 28:23.675
Goddammit, I will be
home when I am home.

28:25.000 --> 28:25.751
Wh..

28:28.680 --> 28:30.876
Ma, what'd she say?

28:33.240 --> 28:35.391
She said give her regards
to the sweetest

28:35.560 --> 28:38.075
and best sister
she's ever had.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.230
Sure.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.594
You gotta eat.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.756
Nicely executed, officer.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.557
Here's to.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.320
- Yeah.
<i>- Feels good, right?</i>

28:55.760 --> 28:56.671
Yeah.

29:01.120 --> 29:01.917
Yeah.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.031
This is not
the last impression

29:12.200 --> 29:14.760
I want my mother
to have of me.

29:14.761 --> 29:17.070
Alrighty, come on.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.870
No, you don't tell me
when to go

29:21.040 --> 29:23.714
I tell you when to go,
and we got plenty of time

29:23.880 --> 29:25.792
we don't have to go.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.553
- Oh, we do?
- Yeah.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.600
Uh, hey, what do you say
we go get a super-quick

29:31.601 --> 29:33.114
shampoo and blowout, huh?

29:34.320 --> 29:36.152
No, we don't have
that much time.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.198
Yeah, but it's just
around the corner.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.715
Twelve bucks,
can't beat that.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.958
It's a hairdressing school
and I used to go there

29:43.960 --> 29:45.599
<i>all the time
before I got locked up.</i>

29:45.600 --> 29:48.957
Fine, but it's not
on the schedule, so, no.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.715
Well, the train's not
on schedule either, man.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.393
We got time,
let's go do it.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.278
This is gonna
kill my mother.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.119
Please.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.715
Anderson,
the answer is no.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.556
You're makin' me
nervous back there

30:13.720 --> 30:15.598
you wanna cop a squat?

30:16.760 --> 30:18.399
Only because my feet hurt.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.513
You married? Officer?

30:35.520 --> 30:37.512
I'd rather not say,
thank you.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.320
Oh, you are so not,
I can tell.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.715
You got a boyfriend?

30:43.440 --> 30:44.669
Not now.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.310
Come on.
Why not, look at you.

30:48.320 --> 30:52.553
I am.. I'm busy.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.552
I work a lot,
I take care of my mom

30:54.720 --> 30:56.120
I don't really have
a lot of time to go out

30:56.121 --> 30:57.713
and meet people.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.396
Too busy for nookie?

31:01.400 --> 31:02.595
Yeah.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.477
I can't believe you still
live with your mother.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.875
Unbelievable.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.119
Yeah, well, she raised me
and my sister on her own.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.716
And, uh, we're
all she has left. So..

31:23.400 --> 31:26.996
<i>So, your sister
helps out, huh?</i>

31:27.000 --> 31:28.753
I wouldn't exactly
put it like that.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.152
She, uh,
she helps herself out.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.550
You know, one thing
I learned in this world?

31:36.200 --> 31:38.078
You gotta help yourself
'cause no one else will.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.799
I think the problem
is too many people

31:39.800 --> 31:41.120
think like that.

31:54.680 --> 31:55.830
You have gorgeous hair!

31:56.000 --> 31:58.959
Well, you girls
did a fantastic job.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.715
Do I have time
to go to the bathroom?

32:01.720 --> 32:02.949
Where's your bathroom?

32:03.120 --> 32:04.474
<i>- Over there.</i>
- Alright.

32:04.640 --> 32:05.710
Save us some bother
a bit later, right?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.314
Yeah, yeah.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.356
Just save you
the trouble later..

32:08.360 --> 32:09.271
Yeah, that's all
I'm talking about.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.955
I mean, you know
what happens when you..

32:11.960 --> 32:13.872
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.433
- Me first.
- Mm-hmm, of course.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.560
Alright.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.074
- Make it quick.
- Thank you so much.

32:21.080 --> 32:21.672
Mm-hmm.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.671
Hm.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.576
<i>Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'.
Just a minute.</i>

33:00.577 --> 33:01.914
<i>I gotta finish
my business.</i>

33:04.200 --> 33:06.760
Oh, baby, real make-up.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.637
Here I come, here I come.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.712
Alrighty. Ready to go?

33:21.320 --> 33:23.152
Someone got a new face.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.596
Oh, come on.
Let's go catch our train.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.600
- Great job, ladies.
- Okay, wait.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.160
Not so fast, please.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.113
Alright.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.793
Oh, I'm right here,
I'm not goin' anywhere.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.314
Where am I gonna go?
Come on. Hey.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.879
- This is so much fun.
- Okay, I need you to..

33:39.040 --> 33:40.633
It's amazing!
I'm right here!

33:40.800 --> 33:42.279
I need you
to restrain yourself.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.873
- And just stay a little..
- I'm restraining myself.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.753
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.599
It's all good,
don't worry.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.194
We don't have far to go,
but we better hurry.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.680
- Hold on, please.
- Whoa! Whoa!

33:50.920 --> 33:51.876
Oh, what?
Oh, your mom again?

33:52.120 --> 33:53.031
Shut up.

33:53.240 --> 33:53.912
Whatever.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.478
No, the train is delayed
another hour.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.672
Oh, God.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.109
Are we even gonna
make it to my mom

34:02.320 --> 34:03.879
before she's dead? Huh?

34:04.080 --> 34:05.833
Maybe I can find us
another way.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.230
One train out there,
that's all there is.

34:10.239 --> 34:13.516
You know, um,
I'm beginning to feel

34:13.520 --> 34:14.397
a little anxious
about all this

34:14.560 --> 34:16.391
it's a lot of excitement
for me today.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.676
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Good, how're you doing?

34:17.840 --> 34:19.559
- I'm doing alright.
- Lookin' good, baby.

34:19.719 --> 34:22.076
- Yeah, thank you, baby.
- Oh, God.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.356
But, uh, I think there's
a meeting right up here

34:24.520 --> 34:26.112
I could pop right in.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.397
Oh, they help me
and calm me right down.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.789
- You ever been to a meeting?
- No, I haven't.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.036
Oh, no. You should try it.
Ten minutes in a church.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.679
It's a beautiful thing.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.313
<i>All kind of a blur.</i>

34:35.480 --> 34:37.597
I met a guy online.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.199
I think we met for brunch.

34:39.360 --> 34:44.560
I, uh, drank three bottles
of rose, uh

34:44.760 --> 34:46.672
but then later on,
at spinning class

34:46.880 --> 34:47.949
I blacked out.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.833
Thank you so much. I feel
so much better already.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.435
- Yeah. Okay. Just..
- I think I hit my neighbor's bike.

34:52.440 --> 34:56.992
And then also, I guess
rock bottom. So, uh..

34:57.000 --> 34:59.595
I know it's only been
since yesterday, I think

34:59.760 --> 35:02.594
but taking it one day
at a time is really

35:02.760 --> 35:06.197
helping me, so..

35:06.360 --> 35:08.079
- Thanks.
- Thanks for sharing, Karen.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.197
Thanks.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.512
Remember, we're all vulnerable
to our feelings and our desires.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.560
The question,
do our emotions drive us

35:20.561 --> 35:22.313
or do we drive our
emotions?

35:28.640 --> 35:31.314
- Hi, warden. Yes, uh...
- E... excuse me.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.115
- One second.
- You can't do that in here.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.396
<i>We need an atmosphere
of recovery. Please.</i>

35:36.400 --> 35:37.993
Of course. Yep.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.311
Ah, no, we're just
at the train station.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.993
Sorry,
it's a little noisy.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.913
Uh-huh, yeah.
Alright. Uh-huh.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.991
Okay. Yeah.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.677
Oh, God! Ah, no, no.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.160
Everything is going great.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.996
Yes. Thank you so much.
Uh-huh, okay.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.355
Oh, God.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.276
Yeah, hi, moms.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.078
<i>Would you like to share,
young lady?</i>

36:06.240 --> 36:10.314
Uh, me? No, I, uh..
I gotta go with my CO.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.959
I gotta go, moms.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.314
<i>And despite these
noble intentions</i>

36:33.320 --> 36:35.118
<i>I was ruining my life.</i>

36:35.280 --> 36:38.079
<i>I violated
the veterinarian's oath</i>

36:38.240 --> 36:40.697
I was taking advantage
of all those female

36:40.698 --> 36:43.156
pet owners who were
distraught over their

36:43.320 --> 36:47.473
sick and injured puppies
and kitty cats.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.040
I lost my family,
and most of my friends

36:50.200 --> 36:51.395
because they were
basically afraid that

36:51.600 --> 36:53.512
I would offer
rescue and shelter

36:53.680 --> 36:56.195
<i>to their wives
and, anc girlfriends</i>

36:56.400 --> 36:58.676
<i>and, anc sometimes
their, their mothers.</i>

36:58.840 --> 37:01.400
Um, excuse me, miss,
but we have a strict rule.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.835
<i>There's no
sitting together</i>

37:03.000 --> 37:04.036
<i>if you coulc just sit
one seat over.</i>

37:04.240 --> 37:07.358
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.591
- When you're ready.
- Yeah. Thanks.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.274
And I was suspended
from the board

37:11.440 --> 37:13.033
of animal medicine.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.079
But now, you are sexually
sober, is that right?

37:16.080 --> 37:19.915
- How long has that been?
- Um... three months.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.557
Whoo! Way to go!

37:23.760 --> 37:27.800
And have you been able to
abstain from masturbation?

37:27.960 --> 37:29.474
<i>Well, that's not easy.</i>

37:29.680 --> 37:30.830
We all know
that our hands

37:30.840 --> 37:33.275
can be our worst enemies
sometimes.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.749
Right? Yeah.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.797
- Right?
- Well, Yes. Yes.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.350
Um, well, keep it up!

37:40.360 --> 37:42.670
Uh, I mean..
I mean, the good work.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.320
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.953
Um, Kevin said
that it's not easy

37:51.160 --> 37:53.311
<i>and that is so true.</i>

37:53.480 --> 37:55.756
<i>Because we have
to remember that</i>

37:55.760 --> 38:01.279
<i>our habit makes true
intimacy impossible.</i>

38:01.440 --> 38:03.318
<i>Lust kills love..</i>

38:05.560 --> 38:07.791
Would anybody else like
to come up and share?

38:17.520 --> 38:19.796
Ah! Ha ha! I forgot
how good this feels.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.473
Oh, me too.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.474
It's been three very
long months.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.632
- Three months?
- Yeah, three months.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.960
Baby, it's been years

38:28.120 --> 38:29.270
since I've been
with somebody.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.033
- Really?
- Yes.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.396
Oh, my God!
You must be famished.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.119
I'm starving!

38:37.680 --> 38:40.274
- Oh, yeah.
- I am so ready..

38:40.275 --> 38:42.869
You think you can
handle me?

38:43.040 --> 38:44.315
Yes, this is going to be
so awesome.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.673
Wait, will you come
to my place?

38:50.680 --> 38:52.672
- What?
- Come across town to my place.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.354
To my shelter,
come to my shelter.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.194
- To your place?
- Yeah, I do.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.317
- Yeah, you wanna come?
- Oh, yeah.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.310
- You wanna come?
- Oh, yeah.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.399
Let me see what my
friend is up to. Huh?

39:21.880 --> 39:22.791
- Oh, no!
- There you are.

39:23.000 --> 39:23.877
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

39:24.040 --> 39:24.917
We got a train to catch.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.639
Yeah, I had to take
a call.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.233
Come on.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.152
The train station is like,
two minutes away from here.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.993
- You feel better now?
- I am so much better.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.720
Thank you so much.
Ugh, ugh..

39:34.880 --> 39:37.679
- Wh... what..
- Ugh! Ugh!

39:37.840 --> 39:38.751
I..

39:41.520 --> 39:43.751
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?

39:43.760 --> 39:46.320
Help! Somebody help!

39:48.200 --> 39:49.395
I'm... I'm a doctor,
I'm a doctor.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.358
Hold her legs,
she's having a seizure.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.797
Is she going to be okay?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.394
- Yeah, if you do what I say..
- Oh, my gosh.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.871
Oh, my gosh, she's
swallowing her tongue.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.639
And she has
a very big tongue.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.158
Okay. Hold her legs, now!

40:05.320 --> 40:06.674
- And spread them.
- Spread them, what?

40:06.880 --> 40:09.554
There's a pharmacy
across the street.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.029
Okay, go and get her
this medicine, alright?

40:12.200 --> 40:13.520
- No I can't go, you gotta go.
- Right away.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.154
No, you gotta go,
I'll stay with her.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.754
I'm... I'm a doctor.
Go, go, officer, go!

40:16.920 --> 40:19.674
Okay! Listen, make sure
she doesn't go anywhere.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.115
No, no, she couldn't
even if she wanted to.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.876
- Go. Please go.
- Alright. B-R-B.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.235
You're gonna be just fine.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.798
Hi. This is
for an emergency!

40:36.480 --> 40:38.199
I need you to hurry,
come on!

40:38.360 --> 40:39.316
Is this some kind of joke?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.392
Joke? No. What?

40:41.560 --> 40:42.676
<i>It's from
a veterinarian.</i>

40:42.680 --> 40:44.399
It's worm medicine
for a dog.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.119
- A dog?
- Mm-hmm.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.277
Bitch.
Not you, sorry.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.272
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.316
No! Oh, my..

41:15.760 --> 41:17.194
No!

41:27.960 --> 41:30.555
<i>You've reached the voice mail
of Doctor Kevin Rivera.</i>

41:30.720 --> 41:33.394
<i>I'm probably busy at the office
or at the kennel..</i>

41:33.560 --> 41:35.358
<i>So please leave a message
after the bark.</i>

41:36.680 --> 41:38.273
Okay, I don't know
if you are aware

41:38.440 --> 41:39.760
but you have
an escapee with you

41:39.920 --> 41:42.435
so you call me back
as soon as you can! Okay?

41:46.880 --> 41:48.473
Oh, God!

41:57.480 --> 41:59.676
<i>Good evening,
Dr. Rivera.</i>

41:59.840 --> 42:02.479
Good evening, Dennis.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.870
Glad to see you're
back to your old self.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.275
Thank you.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.479
Alright, six..

42:20.480 --> 42:22.199
...D

42:23.800 --> 42:26.395
Anderson! I know
you're in there. Open up!

42:28.040 --> 42:30.077
Are you in there?

42:34.600 --> 42:35.590
Anderson!

42:40.720 --> 42:43.189
- May I assist you?
- Ah, yes.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.159
I, I don't know.
Who are you?

42:46.320 --> 42:47.356
Miss, I'm Michael Evans

42:47.360 --> 42:48.794
I'm the building
manager here.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.117
This door you keep
beating on, it's empty.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.953
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.794
Yeah. The doc moved out
a few months ago.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.917
Damn.
Do you know where to?

42:58.080 --> 42:59.912
I have no clue.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.434
I will tell you though,
you're not the first woman

43:01.640 --> 43:04.599
to come beating
on that door.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.239
He must be a hell
of a veterinarian, huh?

43:06.400 --> 43:07.993
- Shit!
- Yeah.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.594
Oh, shit.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.997
You know, I'm,
you know, I'm being nosy.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.354
Just do me a favor,
you can stand in front

43:14.360 --> 43:15.157
of that door
as long as you can

43:15.360 --> 43:16.999
maybe he'll come out,
I doubt it

43:17.160 --> 43:18.355
but just don't bang
on my door, alright?

43:18.520 --> 43:19.874
- Yeah, alright. I got it.
- Alright. Thank you.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.679
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

43:21.680 --> 43:22.431
Yep.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.273
God, that looks easier
in movies.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.952
Okay, Kevin Rivera.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.195
You better beware,
I will find you

43:37.200 --> 43:39.192
where you live.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.551
No. Not now, mom.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.633
Oh, no.

43:45.640 --> 43:47.916
Not now. Come on!

43:48.080 --> 43:50.549
Hey, hey, sir?

44:24.760 --> 44:27.070
<i>I never dreamt
I'd get so lucky</i>

44:27.240 --> 44:29.755
<i>as to play footsie with
a sexaholic veterinarian.</i>

44:32.560 --> 44:33.789
That's not the only thing I play.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.514
<i>- Oh, no?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.592
Nice.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.434
<i>Mr. Evans?</i>

44:45.440 --> 44:46.874
Yeah, uh, come in.

44:48.960 --> 44:52.954
Hey, uh,
can I help you, miss..

44:52.960 --> 44:56.158
Stevens.
Stevens, Nicole. Stevens.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.950
Uh, my phone died

44:59.960 --> 45:01.679
I was wondering if maybe
I could charge it in here.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.600
Oh.. I was literally about
to walk out the door.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.232
- Okay.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

45:08.240 --> 45:10.277
You know, it's king of..
It's kind of urgent.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.354
<i>You a cop?</i>

45:13.360 --> 45:15.397
- I'm a corrections officer.
- Fair enough.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.551
It's my civic duty

45:17.560 --> 45:19.677
to assist you,
Officer Stevens.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.479
Nicole is fine,
thank you.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.676
<i>Outlet is right
over there.</i>

45:22.680 --> 45:24.194
Thank you so, so much.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.953
Charge.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.197
What,
are you here a case?

45:32.360 --> 45:34.829
- I'm tracking a prisoner.
<i>- Oh.</i>

45:34.840 --> 45:36.797
- That I lost.
- You lost a prisoner?

45:37.000 --> 45:38.400
It's a long story,
I'd rather not talk

45:38.560 --> 45:40.677
about it now, thanks.

45:40.680 --> 45:42.239
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

45:44.120 --> 45:46.476
Yeah. Yeah, I would,
thank you.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.155
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.235
So where do you think
your prisoner is

46:09.400 --> 46:11.073
right this moment?

46:11.240 --> 46:12.913
God, I don't know.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.196
Guess she's off havin'
a little party.

46:15.360 --> 46:17.352
<i>Oh, right,
with the old super-vet.</i>

46:17.360 --> 46:18.635
Yeah.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.519
<i>Yeah, he parties
a certain type of way.</i>

46:20.680 --> 46:22.353
Oh, God, please.
I don't wanna know.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.350
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:25.080 --> 46:27.436
You got a tough job
ahead of you, Nicole.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.238
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm not gonna have

46:29.400 --> 46:30.197
a job after this.

46:30.360 --> 46:33.080
No, don't say that.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.038
You're good
at what you do.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.954
- I can tell.
- Mm..

46:37.960 --> 46:40.520
Fair enough. You're not
the best at what you do.

46:40.680 --> 46:45.038
But... you look good in
that corrections uniform.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.793
<i>You look like a badass.</i>

46:48.720 --> 46:53.112
What you should do
is think like a criminal.

46:53.120 --> 46:56.192
<i>You need to get into
the mind of the criminal.</i>

46:56.200 --> 46:59.159
<i>It will lead you
to your criminal.</i>

46:59.160 --> 47:01.516
Develop a perp's
perspective.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.711
A perp-spective.
Exactly.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.952
You think you could
do me a favor?

47:09.120 --> 47:09.792
Yeah, what's up?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.878
That office upstairs,
can you unlock it?

47:12.040 --> 47:13.952
You're thinkin' like a criminal.
Come on, let's go.

47:13.960 --> 47:16.077
Thank you.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.116
We'll probably
both lose our jobs.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.034
Thank you,
thank you so much.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.872
Let's make this one fast.
I wanna get you in here quick.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.713
Go ahead.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.716
<i>Can I help?
Oh, well, try not to..</i>

47:43.440 --> 47:44.954
Alright, well,
I'm tryin' to keep my job.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.633
- They're all empty.
- Ooh.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.113
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.349
It's okay.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.751
Bingo.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.399
I told you she was badass,
look at this!

48:09.560 --> 48:11.597
Yeah! Hell, yeah!

48:11.760 --> 48:14.639
Okay. Oh, shit.
Yeah.

48:14.640 --> 48:16.791
- Uh.
- Perp-spective.

48:26.280 --> 48:27.475
Ahh!

48:37.440 --> 48:39.830
- Can I see you again?
- Um..

48:41.480 --> 48:43.199
I'd like to,
I mean, I'd like you to

48:43.360 --> 48:44.953
you know, yes. Sure.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.679
Great, I would love to,
I mean, under

48:46.680 --> 48:48.779
different circumstances
it would be great.

48:48.780 --> 48:50.880
- Okay.
- Well, I know you live upstate.

48:51.040 --> 48:54.431
I do. I live with
my... self. Upstate. So..

48:54.600 --> 48:59.356
But I... I... I come to the
city, you know, often. So..

48:59.360 --> 49:03.070
Look, oh,
this is my card.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.072
- Oh, yeah.
- Got my number on there.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.515
I'll call you now
so that...

49:06.520 --> 49:08.512
Right! So that I have..
Yeah, we call each other.

49:08.680 --> 49:11.878
- You can call me if you want to.
- Right.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.360
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.714
- Hello.
- Hello.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.631
Hey. Who this?

49:21.840 --> 49:25.151
Is, is this building,
uh, manager Michael Evans?

49:25.320 --> 49:27.710
Is this Officer Stevens?

49:27.720 --> 49:28.949
No, this is Nicole.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.874
You sound great
over the phone.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.760
You do, you sound..
You got a nice voice.

49:34.761 --> 49:37.480
You sound, you sound
really good..

49:37.680 --> 49:41.151
Uh, well,
I, I got your number.

49:41.360 --> 49:42.430
- I'm gonna hang up now.
- I'm gonna hang up now.

49:42.640 --> 49:43.790
Okay. Alright, well..

49:46.240 --> 49:48.277
We should... we should
do this some other time.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.352
We should get together,
alright?

49:50.520 --> 49:54.309
Yeah. Thank you
for the... electricity.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.471
- Of course.
- I'm gonna go.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.876
- Okay.
- But thank you.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.874
- Alright.
- We'll talk soon.

50:02.880 --> 50:04.030
Absolutely. Call..
You got my number.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.157
- I.. You have mine too. So..
- Alright.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.754
Okay.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.433
Whoopie! Ha-ha.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.955
- Have a nice time, miss?
- Oh, you bet, best time ever.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.960
Anderson.

50:26.120 --> 50:29.477
Miss Stevens!
Where have you been, huh?

50:31.720 --> 50:34.030
I'm taking you upstate.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.078
And you're gonna be there
for a long time

50:36.240 --> 50:39.074
so I really hope that your little trip
to the vet was worth it.

50:39.080 --> 50:40.560
Oh, it was worth it.

50:40.760 --> 50:42.194
Oh, sister,
you don't know.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.034
Yeah, good.
I hope he de-flea'd you.

50:46.120 --> 50:46.997
Go!

50:50.160 --> 50:51.150
Bye, Dennis.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.120
Goodbye, Dennis.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.553
If we hurry,
we can catch...

50:57.720 --> 50:59.279
Oh, you are certifiable
if you think

50:59.440 --> 51:00.840
I am getting on a train
with you right now.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.390
I... I... I am getting
on a train, but you are going

51:03.400 --> 51:04.720
back upstate where you belong.
You are in...

51:04.880 --> 51:06.234
No, we gotta go out
to the island.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.635
We gotta go see my mother.

51:07.640 --> 51:08.517
- I'm in trouble?
- Yeah.

51:08.680 --> 51:10.558
- What about you?
- What about me?

51:10.560 --> 51:12.597
What happened. You wanna
make warden... warden look bad

51:12.600 --> 51:14.398
for God's sake? I know.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.916
I'll tell you what we do, I'll tell you
what we do, alright?

51:17.080 --> 51:18.912
Here I am,
I'm in your custody.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.276
We go out,
say goodbye to mom

51:21.280 --> 51:23.999
and get me back in time
for Sunday lock-up.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.276
And now, it looks like you
know what you're doin' for once.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.277
Won't you just, shh?

51:31.280 --> 51:33.272
Just shut your mouth
and stop talking, okay?

51:33.480 --> 51:34.879
I don't wanna hear
you speak!

51:34.880 --> 51:37.315
I'm not speakin',
I'm not sayin' a word.

51:37.480 --> 51:38.516
<i>I hear sound's comin' out
of your mouth.</i>

51:40.720 --> 51:42.837
<i>Ticket, please.</i>

51:42.840 --> 51:45.150
Would you mind
taking your leg off

51:45.160 --> 51:47.720
of my belongings, please?
Thank you.

51:47.721 --> 51:49.074
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.440
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.875
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.713
<i>This is where
you grew up?</i>

52:32.720 --> 52:34.871
<i>Home sweet home.</i>

52:57.080 --> 52:58.719
Just give me a second,
alright?

52:58.720 --> 53:01.110
You're ringin' in five, four,
three, two, one, or I do.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.680
Haven't you had a good time today?
I've had a great time.

53:02.880 --> 53:03.757
...four...

53:04.520 --> 53:05.556
...three..

53:07.840 --> 53:09.160
Hmm?

53:10.320 --> 53:12.960
Well, guarantee ya
that's about to end.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.071
You look good.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.635
Thanks.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.673
Get in here, Joan!

53:26.840 --> 53:29.833
Oh, my goodness.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.879
Let me look at you!

53:33.040 --> 53:36.317
Oh, my goodness!

53:36.320 --> 53:39.677
Oh, God.
Let me look at you.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.751
This is Nicole, Paula.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.592
It's Officer Stevens,
if you don't mind, ma'am.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.319
No, Officer Stevens.
Sorry.

53:45.480 --> 53:48.757
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.240
If you'll excuse me.

53:52.400 --> 53:55.199
- Give me the right.
<i>- What is she doing?</i>

53:55.360 --> 53:57.397
<i>She's just
coin' her job.</i>

53:57.560 --> 53:59.950
- Alright, down. Other one.
- Yup.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.998
Don't, don't watch it.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.231
Do you have to do this
in here?

54:04.400 --> 54:06.198
If you knew what it took
to get us here, ma'am

54:06.360 --> 54:08.158
you'd be shacklin'
her yourself, so, yep.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.231
Yep, I do.
Alright, come on.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.279
Mother?

54:54.240 --> 54:55.390
<i>Mother?</i>

54:57.680 --> 54:59.114
I'm here.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.155
Figures..

55:06.160 --> 55:07.674
You didn't really wanna
see me, did you?

55:09.480 --> 55:12.359
But I thank you
for the lovely holiday.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.435
Oh, my God,
you're still with us.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.751
Hello.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.555
It's Joan, your daughter.

55:21.560 --> 55:26.077
Joan?
Ah! I'm glad you came.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.630
- You are?
- Yes, I'm glad you came.

55:29.920 --> 55:33.630
Oh, hello, mother.

55:33.800 --> 55:36.952
I need you
to sign some papers.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.834
Sign what papers?

55:41.440 --> 55:44.399
<i>To give you some money.</i>

55:44.560 --> 55:46.074
Well, you don't need
my signature

55:46.280 --> 55:48.351
to put me back
in your will.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.113
Not the will.

55:50.320 --> 55:54.030
It's, it's an agreement.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.913
What kind of agreement?

55:56.120 --> 56:00.080
For you
to live your life

56:00.240 --> 56:02.311
<i>any way it pleases you.</i>

56:03.960 --> 56:05.280
Oh, mother.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.631
Oh! What's the catch?

56:10.840 --> 56:14.959
I want you to stay away
from my granddaughter.

56:18.600 --> 56:20.353
<i>You mean my daughter?
I can't do that.</i>

56:20.560 --> 56:21.835
I'm clean and sober now.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.672
I get out in six months.
I'm gonna find her

56:23.840 --> 56:26.799
I'm gonna make
that right.

56:26.960 --> 56:29.270
She is nothing like you.

56:29.440 --> 56:33.070
She's a lovely,
sweet, young woman.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.476
<i>I don't want you
to cisrupt her life.</i>

56:37.280 --> 56:38.839
I don't doubt
she's lovely.

56:38.840 --> 56:40.479
I would like to meet her
some day, alright?

56:40.640 --> 56:44.350
You must never,
ever see her.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.350
Promise me!

56:45.520 --> 56:48.513
You are a cold bitch.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.273
<i>You'll get
a $100,000 a year</i>

56:50.440 --> 56:52.591
<i>in monthly payments</i>

56:52.800 --> 56:55.872
but as estate executor,
I will stop the checks

56:56.040 --> 56:57.997
the minute I find out

56:58.160 --> 57:00.391
you've breached your contract
and made contact with her.

57:06.720 --> 57:07.597
<i>Joan..</i>

57:09.400 --> 57:12.950
You're 50-something-year-old
convict.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.189
You have no skills.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.916
<i>Take the money.</i>

57:18.120 --> 57:19.952
What does she
actually know about me?

57:22.640 --> 57:24.597
Nothing.

57:24.600 --> 57:27.354
The adoption papers say

57:27.520 --> 57:30.399
that you died
in childbirth.

57:34.040 --> 57:35.679
Was that really necessary?

57:41.800 --> 57:43.359
Let's go.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.629
Paula.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.471
<i>What's her name?</i>

58:05.480 --> 58:07.756
Do you know
my daughter's name?

58:07.760 --> 58:09.274
Lily Benson.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.309
Thank you.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.190
Go.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.113
- Love you.
- Love you too.

58:38.600 --> 58:40.478
<i>Anderson, you okay?</i>

58:48.160 --> 58:49.435
You wanted
to keep the baby?

58:51.440 --> 58:52.760
I don't know
what I wanted.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.231
No one ever gave me
any choice.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.630
Now, all these years later
she wants to pay me off

59:03.800 --> 59:05.359
to not see my kid.

59:07.320 --> 59:08.800
<i>I got a daughter
out there.</i>

59:11.080 --> 59:12.639
She thinks I'm dead.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.356
It's not right.

59:25.480 --> 59:26.630
No, it isn't.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.350
<i>Okay, next.</i>

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.390
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.870
<i>Your car's reacy now.</i>

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.869
- Thanks.
- No, wait!

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.713
- Your license and your credit card.
- Yeah.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.712
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.758
- Hey. Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.958
I had a spot of
car trouble this morning

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.032
and I was wondering
if I could

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.635
trouble you for a lift?

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.111
Mm. Insurance issues.
Sorry, I can't.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.749
- Yeah, insurance, it's a bitch.
- Yeah.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.719
I, um..

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.359
Look, I, I... I
don't usually

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.430
do this sort of thing

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.831
but, uh, it's been
a totally hectic morning

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.993
and, um,
if you would kindly

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.710
see your way
to giving me a ride

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.519
I'd be willing
to give you a blow job.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.559
Mm, hop on board.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.358
Fantastic!
Awesome!

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.029
I can't believe you!

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.430
You are going away
for a long time. Up!

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.359
Put 'em behind
your back.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.636
We'll have that little ride
another time, huh?

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.677
- That's it. Up!
- Alright.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.718
Whoa!

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.109
- Come on.
- Everything cool?

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.476
Yeah. Everything's cool.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.830
You know, I'm gonna report
you for this, right?

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.994
<i>It's gonna mean years.</i>

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.159
What were you thinking?

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.719
You think I was thinkin'?

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.639
Assholes don't think.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.633
Nope, they don't
and you are an asshole, alright?

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.757
You had six months
left and now

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.151
<i>you're goin' away
for a long time.</i>

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.071
<i>Asshole.</i>

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.831
<i>You, you know what?</i>

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.714
<i>You are the most
exhausting</i>

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.435
<i>self-cestructive person
I have ever met.</i>

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.034
You got that right.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.431
Oh, Jesus.
Hi, mommy!

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.836
What do you want me
to do for you now, mommy?

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.637
Hello.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.029
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.751
Yeah, okay.
Mm-hmm.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.310
<i>That was your
mother's lawyer.</i>

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.675
<i>She passed.</i>

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.751
You heard me?

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.274
Loud and clear.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.392
Get me back to my cell.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.790
Yup. Gladly.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.789
You okay?

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.072
Oh, yeah, I'm great.
Just great.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.520
<i>Do you neec me
to pull over, Anderson?</i>

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.872
I'm fine.
What's the matter?

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.715
Where are we?

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.114
We're at the home
of Lily Benson.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.199
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.790
Nicole! Wait a minute,
where are you going?

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.393
<i>Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, shit.</i>

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.800
I didn't ask you
to bring me here.

01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:45.631
Yeah.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.118
Get out.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.754
What are trying to pull?

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.752
You have exactly
15 minutes, okay?

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.559
And don't even think about
thinking about doin' anything.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.755
I want you to stand close
to that door

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.956
where I can see you
from here.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.920
I don't,
I... I can't do this.

01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:03.593
Yeah. No, no. Not now.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.319
- Not like this.
- Anderson, you're goin' away for a while.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.710
So I think
now is the time.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.396
Go on.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:20.510
Go on.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.990
Hello.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.479
Oh, hi.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:08:59.999
Oh, my God, um..

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.314
I'm... I'm
looking for Lily.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:05.515
I'm her.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.389
Can I help you?

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.350
Um..

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.430
...I'm, I... I knew
her mother.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.514
- You know Norma?
- Uh, her birth mother.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.272
- My birth mother?
- Oh, God.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:24.158
You, you knew that..

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.118
Yeah, my parents told me
when I was 12.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.680
And... did they tell you
anything

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.274
about your... mother?

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:38.073
Excuse me, but why did you
come here?

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.035
She would have
wanted me to.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.788
Would you like
to step inside?

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.393
Yeah, thanks.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.196
How did you know her?

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.159
I, um, uh..

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.039
We were best friends
when, uh, we were young.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.400
Why didn't you contact me
before?

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.519
Oh, I just, I just
found out about you, um..

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.231
I'm her only child?

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.956
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.510
Are you, are you married?

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.799
Yeah. Um, Brad's helping
a friend with an addition.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.870
- Beautiful, beautiful home.
- Oh.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.919
Do you have children?

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.032
Just Johnny, he's seven.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.600
Hey, hon,
come downstairs.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.280
Do you work?

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.877
I'm a graphic designer.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.031
I work from the house.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.511
It's, um,
it's kind of slow.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.915
Can I get you something
to drink?

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.719
Some coffee
or juice or water?

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.757
Water would be fantastic.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.989
Have a seat.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.031
Hello, lady.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.458
Oh, hello, boy.

01:11:28.459 --> 01:11:30.718
What are you doin'?

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.154
I'm coloring a truck.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.958
Ooh, a truck.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.280
Ah, thank you.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.752
Ma, this lady's
watching me color a truck.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.036
And I hope it's okay.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.434
He loves his trucks.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.511
Yeah, I see that.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.917
How do you think my mother would feel
about being a grandmother?

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.680
Once she got over
the shock..

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.234
I know she'd dig it.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.274
If I could talk
to my mother..

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.276
...I'd tell her that..

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.272
...I didn't care what
she did in the past.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.113
She'd be welcome
to visit anytime.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.079
I... I... I gotta
get goin'.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.538
You could stay for dinner?

01:12:33.539 --> 01:12:35.798
Uh, maybe another time.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.712
Yeah, okay.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.350
Bye.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.196
Yeah.
Don't worry, I got it.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.240
I'll take care of that.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.270
I'll get
the other one too.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.516
All locked up.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.269
Alright, lift up.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.200
Stevens!

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.079
What in the hell
is goin' on?

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.275
You know, your phone was goin'
straight to voicemail?

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.800
And I hear
you rented a car?

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.110
That's not in the budget!

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.713
Please tell me
what is happening?

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.951
Alright, sir, there is
a very good explanation.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.952
Oh, she's got a very
good explanation she says.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.589
Please tell me
your goddamn explanation.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.319
There was a problem
this morning.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.800
What? With the prisoner?

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.871
With the train.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.192
There was a three hour
delay and I didn't wanna risk it

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.351
so I thought it'd best
just to rent a car.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.954
As for my phone,
there were some issues

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.271
with my provider,
but I'm resolving them.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.000
Warden, warden if I might
have permission to speak.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.310
Speak, Anderson.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.233
Uh, well, I would
just like to say

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.793
that in spite of all the unbelievable
travel snafus we came upon

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.556
it was, in fact, Officer
Stevens' single-minded determination

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.632
that got me to my mother's
bedside before she passed.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.430
And I know her gratitude
was absolutely expressed

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.319
to her very good friend,
the governor.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.597
Oh. Huh... alright.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.833
Stevens, you did good.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.158
I want you to come in to fill out
some paperwork for a full time position.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.276
I'm going to put you
on staff.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.749
Thank you so much, sir.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.911
Alright, I gotta get down
to The Jackknife.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.756
It's karaoke night.
So, ladies, good evenin'!

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.433
- Sing well, sir.
- Always do.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.835
You did me right in there.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.435
I owe you a thank you
and an apology.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.635
Yeah, you do, several.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.477
Hey, I think it's best if we forget
about this weekend, alright?

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.551
Our little secret.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.039
You got it,
Officer Stevens.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.033
See you around, Joan.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.072
<i>I don't understand why you don't
know where my pills are!</i>

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.550
<i>You know, any time
I ask Nicole for my pills</i>

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.120
<i>she has put them in a strategic
place for me to find them.</i>

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.511
- Nicole, Nicole, Nicole!
<i>- Where is my book?</i>

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.636
You got somethin'
to say to me, sis?

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:17.951
I do.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.670
Where the hell
have you been?

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.196
Working my ass off.
Where else, Brandy?

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.035
I have a life.
I have my own family.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.953
So how dare you run off and
leave me holdin' the bag?

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.634
Well, you don't think
I'd like those things

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.234
particularly
in that order?

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.594
I would, okay?

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.035
But how am I supposed
to get those things

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.918
if all I do is work
and take care of moms?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.597
- Hi, Nicole.
<i>- Hi, moms.</i>

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.240
Did you save me
that piece of cake?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.320
I forgot.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.192
See? See?

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.354
Okay, from now on,
I'm gonna get my fair share.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.399
I will help out with moms
with you, but not instead of you

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.550
because what I will not do

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.154
is I will not give up
my life.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.279
I know you don't think
that I have a life, but I do.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.954
And I will not give it up,
so that you can live yours. Okay?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.594
- Moms, sit down.
- Okay.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.359
I will help out
as best as I can.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.000
- But I am a grown woman.
- I know.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.710
Which means, I have to live my life
for myself, okay?

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.360
- Okay. Okay.
- Not just for you.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.796
That was easier than I thought
it was gonna be.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.030
This is non-negotiable.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.310
Okay.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.631
I got it, thank you.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.031
<i>I can't believe
she ate my cake.</i>

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.431
- That's so wrong.
- Sorry

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.556
That's okay.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.635
Hello?

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.160
<i>I've got an all-points
bulletin out</i>

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.154
<i>on a super-cute,
Taser-packin', bacass.</i>

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.154
<i>Woulc you happen
to have a 20 on her current location?</i>

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.630
Is there a badass here?

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.870
- Ma.
- Ma.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.030
<i>What?</i>

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.315
Why are you on my phone?

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.240
- Because it rang and you were talking.
- Mom.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.715
Why would you
answer her phone?

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.793
Because it was under
my butt cheek.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.917
<i>Uh, where's
Nicole Stevens?</i>

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.199
Uh, yes. Is this, uh, building manager,
Michael Evans?

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.794
I think I ate the cake.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.038
I love you, mom.

01:18:11.039 --> 01:18:12.718
I love you too.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.871
I like that phone
feeling though.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.637
Well, the twenty on
Nicole Stevens

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.269
is that she is currently
walkin' into her bedroom

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.636
and takin' off her uniform

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.959
in preparation for a nice,
hot bubble bath.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.270
So you tell me.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.279
Who's thinking
like a criminal now?

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.471
So you ready for me
to kick your ass in checkers?

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.960
Wanna try Candyland?

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.337
You did your hair?

01:18:39.338 --> 01:18:40.556
Yeah, you like it?

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.359
It's not bad
for an old lady.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.680
You know I'm a grandma?

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.560
- No, shit!
- Uh-huh. You got kids?

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.552
Uh-huh.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.313
Oh, my God.
They twins?
