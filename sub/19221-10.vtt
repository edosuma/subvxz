WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:03.695
- There you go.
- Thank you, Arthur.

00:03.734 --> 00:06.520
And I hope I can count
on your vote tomorrow.

00:06.522 --> 00:07.588
What are you talking about?

00:07.590 --> 00:09.407
The Uptown Business Council elections.

00:09.470 --> 00:12.159
I believe I would make a great leader.

00:12.161 --> 00:16.197
And I think a certain
American president would agree.

00:17.266 --> 00:19.634
No, I haven't been part of
that council for 15 years.

00:19.636 --> 00:20.902
Oh.

00:20.904 --> 00:22.637
I see.

00:23.606 --> 00:27.309
Uh-huh. Yeah, a'ight.

00:27.311 --> 00:29.244
Thanks for letting me know, man.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.745
Hey, Franco,

00:30.747 --> 00:32.213
was that the '90s calling to say

00:32.215 --> 00:33.782
they want that sweater back?

00:35.719 --> 00:38.687
Nah, it was my friend calling.

00:38.689 --> 00:41.623
This dude I grew up with
just died in a car accident.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.392
Oh. Sorry, man.

00:44.394 --> 00:47.356
Great burn, wrong
time. Story of my life.

00:48.832 --> 00:49.998
Ah, that's terrible,
kid. Were you close?

00:50.718 --> 00:51.624
I mean, kind of.

00:51.655 --> 00:52.267
I met him when I was painting

00:52.269 --> 00:53.468
on his wall in his neighborhood.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.936
And he thought I was
tagging his crew's block.

00:54.938 --> 00:58.186
His "crew"? You mean
he was a gang member?

00:58.225 --> 00:59.007
You were friends with a guy in a gang?

00:59.009 --> 01:00.942
Come on, Arthur, look, you
grow up in this neighborhood,

01:00.944 --> 01:02.043
you gonna know a few dudes.

01:02.045 --> 01:04.078
True dat.

01:05.348 --> 01:08.350
What? I know some dudes, too.

01:09.018 --> 01:10.852
No, I don't.

01:12.088 --> 01:14.723
And the dope thing about Bam-Bam
was that he respected my skills.

01:14.725 --> 01:16.558
So much that he made sure
I stayed out of his crew.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.426
You know, so I could focus on my art.

01:18.428 --> 01:19.995
Pretty much protected me.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.330
Wait a minute. Bam-Bam died?

01:22.332 --> 01:23.164
Did you know him?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.867
Well, I arrested him a lot.

01:25.869 --> 01:29.404
Most of our conversation was
me reading him his rights.

01:29.406 --> 01:30.772
Occasionally, he'd throw in AF:

01:30.774 --> 01:32.705
"Get off me, bitch."

01:33.744 --> 01:36.911
But that was mostly to James.

01:38.681 --> 01:42.083
Sorry for your loss, Franco,
but Bam-Bam had quite a record.

01:42.085 --> 01:43.852
Drug trafficking,
assault. All right, look,

01:43.854 --> 01:45.420
but he was trying to
get away from all that.

01:45.422 --> 01:47.288
I mean, I bet you ain't know
that Bam-Bam would give money

01:47.290 --> 01:48.490
to people who fell on hard times, too.

01:48.492 --> 01:50.625
Yeah, money he made selling drugs.

01:50.627 --> 01:52.193
Look, I'm sorry,

01:52.195 --> 01:54.496
but the guy was no saint.

01:54.498 --> 01:55.597
All right, James.

01:55.599 --> 01:57.766
Last one to the squad car gets to drive.

02:02.538 --> 02:04.672
I said "the last one."

02:04.674 --> 02:08.109
You know, for a cop,
he's not a great listener.

02:09.407 --> 02:10.848
Yo, Arthur,

02:10.900 --> 02:12.113
would it be cool if I brought
some friends back here?

02:12.115 --> 02:13.415
You know, after the funeral tomorrow?

02:13.417 --> 02:14.649
Chill out, catch up?

02:14.651 --> 02:16.718
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, kid.
- All right.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.255
Wait, you're gonna let him
bring his gang friends here?

02:20.257 --> 02:21.756
They're not in a gang.

02:21.758 --> 02:24.292
Well...

02:24.294 --> 02:26.895
Most of them are not in a gang.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.531
Well...

02:29.533 --> 02:31.433
Well, you're lucky
I'm not president yet,

02:31.435 --> 02:33.568
because such things
will not be tolerated

02:33.570 --> 02:37.005
under the Fawz Al-Shahrani regime.

02:37.007 --> 02:38.506
"Regime"?

02:38.508 --> 02:40.475
Sorry, I sound like a dictator.

02:40.477 --> 02:42.243
I meant empire.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.880
What's up, everybody?

02:45.882 --> 02:48.116
Glorious, glorious day.

02:48.118 --> 02:50.318
Sweatpants must not
know about Bam-Bam yet.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.053
He ain't gonna take this well.

02:52.055 --> 02:53.922
Yo, Sweatpants, I got some news, man.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.490
As do I. Boom.

02:55.492 --> 02:59.160
"Local Chicago kid wins $50
on a scratch-off ticket."

02:59.162 --> 03:02.430
Donut holes for everybody.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.099
That's dope, but listen up, man.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.900
That's not even the dopest part.

03:05.902 --> 03:07.302
So I went to get myself a sub, right?

03:07.304 --> 03:08.536
Turns out the fridge was broken,

03:08.538 --> 03:10.872
and they weren't sure
about the meat or the mayo,

03:10.874 --> 03:15.009
so they gave me the sandwich for free.

03:15.011 --> 03:15.948
Man...

03:15.964 --> 03:16.675
That's disgusting.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.080
But Sweatpants, man...

03:19.082 --> 03:20.315
Listen up, man. I...

03:20.317 --> 03:22.617
Oh, no way. Remember Sonya?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.449
The girl who said she never
wanted to see you again?

03:24.520 --> 03:27.472
Here's a twist, she does
want to see me again.

03:27.891 --> 03:31.259
It feels like International
Sweatpants Day.

03:31.261 --> 03:33.461
He's too happy, I can't do it.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.798
I got this, kiddo.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.968
The key is to ease into it.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.537
- Hey, Sweatpants, how's it going?
- Good.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.939
Bam-Bam is dead.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.886 --> 04:01.156
Man, I still can't
believe Bam-Bam's gone.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.924
Yeah. But you know what?

04:02.926 --> 04:05.193
Let's pour one out for Double B.

04:05.195 --> 04:06.427
- Yeah.
- Miss you, man.

04:06.429 --> 04:07.829
- RIP, Bam.
- Love you, man.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.435
Well, I still work here,
so I should clean that up.

04:17.473 --> 04:19.641
Arthur, donuts for my colleagues.

04:19.642 --> 04:20.942
You're looking at the new president

04:20.944 --> 04:22.710
of the Uptown Business Council.

04:22.712 --> 04:24.913
I won in a landslide.

04:24.915 --> 04:27.115
No one else ran, huh?

04:27.599 --> 04:29.544
No, s-someone else ran.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.252
It's not that big of...

04:32.521 --> 04:35.690
Arthur, this is Manfred.
He owns a gay paper store.

04:37.393 --> 04:41.262
It is a paper store. I
just happen to be gay.

04:41.264 --> 04:42.697
Right, right.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.818
He runs it with his buddy.

04:45.936 --> 04:48.436
He is my husband.

04:49.305 --> 04:50.605
And he's working as my cashier,

04:50.607 --> 04:53.408
while he tries to pass
the real estate exam...

04:53.410 --> 04:55.643
again.

04:55.645 --> 04:57.278
Well, it's nice to meet you, Manfred.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.113
And, uh, congratulations, Fawz.

04:59.115 --> 05:00.615
Thank you.

05:00.617 --> 05:02.150
Arthur, I cannot believe

05:02.152 --> 05:04.135
you let those gang people in here.

05:05.155 --> 05:06.487
Listen, anyone with a shirt and shoes

05:06.489 --> 05:09.424
and a hole to put a
donut in is welcome here.

05:09.426 --> 05:12.193
But, Arthur, we are trying to attract

05:12.195 --> 05:14.162
upscale businesses to the neighborhood,

05:14.164 --> 05:15.797
not scare them away.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.599
As council president,

05:17.601 --> 05:19.867
I ask that you expel them immediately.

05:19.869 --> 05:21.069
No, Fawz.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.004
Okay, I didn't want to have to do this,

05:23.006 --> 05:24.305
but I command you!

05:24.307 --> 05:25.286
Oh.

05:27.143 --> 05:28.810
Why didn't that work?

05:28.812 --> 05:30.612
'Cause you're not a wizard.

05:32.348 --> 05:34.599
Bam-Bam touched so many lives, you know?

05:34.646 --> 05:36.951
Yeah. I was starting to get into drugs.

05:36.953 --> 05:40.388
Then, he saw my passion
for rhyming and pushed me.

05:40.390 --> 05:41.623
Yeah, into the rap game?

05:41.625 --> 05:44.058
Cooler. Children's literature.

05:45.894 --> 05:47.328
My latest book,

05:47.330 --> 05:49.564
Captain Lance France and
his Banana Pants Dance,

05:49.566 --> 05:51.733
come out next month.

05:53.669 --> 05:55.536
I'm doing a signing at Barnes & Noble.

05:55.538 --> 05:58.039
Whatever. NBD, which means...

05:58.041 --> 06:00.975
I know what it means, Big
Mike. What about you, Vince?

06:01.750 --> 06:03.216
Bam-Bam's the reason I became a dentist.

06:03.354 --> 06:04.545
You know, I was just a
nerd with fresh breath,

06:04.547 --> 06:06.147
but he saw something more in me.

06:06.149 --> 06:08.449
And now, I have a Porsche and a hot wife

06:08.451 --> 06:10.351
who only loves me for my money.

06:10.353 --> 06:11.853
Wow, man. That's the dream.

06:11.855 --> 06:14.155
Well-well, I remember

06:14.157 --> 06:16.024
when Bam-Bam saw me tagging
up the neighborhood, right?

06:16.026 --> 06:17.692
A-And he said I should become an artist.

06:17.694 --> 06:19.727
And it changed the
direction of my whole life.

06:19.729 --> 06:20.895
You're an artist?

06:20.897 --> 06:22.630
I thought you worked here.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.699
I do. You know, while
I'm working on my art.

06:24.701 --> 06:27.201
Yeah, I-I put in a lot
of hours here at the shop,

06:27.203 --> 06:29.304
and, you know, it's hard
to find the time, but...

06:29.306 --> 06:32.640
Well, you got to work
that creative muscle.

06:34.343 --> 06:36.010
For me, every day,

06:36.012 --> 06:40.014
it's wake up, meditate, banana pants.

06:42.685 --> 06:44.952
Right, right. B-B-Banana pants.

06:44.954 --> 06:46.087
It-It's okay, Franco.

06:46.089 --> 06:47.422
Everybody goes at their own pace.

06:47.424 --> 06:48.790
You'll get to it someday.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.258
Yeah.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.126
Well, you know, one day
I'll fulfill my dreams,

06:52.128 --> 06:55.963
but, uh, right now, it's time
to fill those Boston creams.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.832
Nice rhyme.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.701
You ever thought about children's books?

06:59.703 --> 07:00.535
Nah.

07:00.537 --> 07:02.870
Good.

07:05.774 --> 07:07.608
Hey, kid, your friends
are still outside.

07:07.610 --> 07:08.943
What are you doing here?

07:08.945 --> 07:12.046
Man, I just had to finish
those Boston creams.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.185
Oh, boy. Look, I-I know you're sad,

07:17.187 --> 07:19.556
but the custard gun is not the answer.

07:20.623 --> 07:21.956
It's not just that.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.925
Seeing all my friends made me realize

07:23.927 --> 07:25.827
that Bam-Bam put all
this faith in my art,

07:25.829 --> 07:28.563
and what have I done with it? Nothing.

07:28.565 --> 07:30.465
Hmm. You know, when I was a kid,

07:30.467 --> 07:32.951
I wanted to play
harmonica in a blues band.

07:33.147 --> 07:34.694
Yeah, I wanted to be
one of the great ones,

07:34.811 --> 07:37.805
you know, like Little
Walter or Sugar Blue.

07:37.807 --> 07:40.141
I was gonna be "Sugar Jew."

07:40.143 --> 07:42.810
Man, you own a donut
shop, you are "Sugar Jew."

07:42.812 --> 07:44.579
Yeah, I know.

07:44.581 --> 07:46.681
Anyway, I got busy running the shop,

07:46.683 --> 07:49.417
marrying Joanie, and, uh,
life just got away from me.

07:49.419 --> 07:51.986
I mean, my dream just passed me by. Hmm.

07:51.988 --> 07:55.056
I've been meaning to paint.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.058
But I get so tired after work.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.060
And, you know, canvases are expensive.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.429
Oh, come on, come on.
Those are just excuses.

08:01.431 --> 08:03.398
Huh? Come on.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.567
You're a resourceful guy,
right? You're a street artist.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.236
Hey, wouldn't it be great

08:08.238 --> 08:11.773
if you could show the world
what Bam-Bam saw in you?

08:13.742 --> 08:15.209
Yo, Arthur,

08:15.211 --> 08:16.511
you just gave me a great idea, man.

08:16.513 --> 08:17.779
Damn right I did.

08:17.781 --> 08:19.614
- What was it?
- All right.

08:19.616 --> 08:21.816
I mean, you got the biggest
canvas on the block, dude.

08:21.818 --> 08:23.384
- Yeah.
- The outside wall of your building.

08:23.386 --> 08:25.753
- Oh.
- It's perfect.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.955
- You want to paint on my wall, huh?
- Uh-huh.

08:27.957 --> 08:29.590
My clean, beautiful brick wall

08:29.592 --> 08:32.407
that I just had sandblasted
30 years ago, but...

08:32.500 --> 08:33.188
Oh...

08:33.399 --> 08:35.797
It's perfect. It's big a-and it's blank,

08:35.799 --> 08:38.866
and best of all, it's free.

08:38.868 --> 08:41.034
- Oh, what the hell. Go for it.
- Yeah?

08:41.037 --> 08:42.804
- Yeah.
- Oh. Thanks, Sugar Jew.

08:44.407 --> 08:46.774
- Sugar Jew, that's a good name.
- Sugar Jew!

08:50.913 --> 08:52.889
- Yo, Arthur.
- Oh, boy.

08:52.943 --> 08:54.148
- You're here early.
- No, no, no. I was up

08:54.150 --> 08:56.651
all night painting the wall.
Man, I was in the zone, man.

08:56.653 --> 08:58.152
Just... the ideas are
just coming out of me.

08:58.154 --> 08:59.687
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm a
little hopped up right now.

08:59.689 --> 09:01.622
I ran out of custard, moved on to jelly.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.491
Mmm.

09:03.493 --> 09:05.491
I ain't never gonna die!

09:06.329 --> 09:08.196
All right now, just hand over the gun.

09:08.198 --> 09:10.932
- Mm-mm.
- Nice and easy.

09:10.934 --> 09:12.767
All right, come on. You
got to see this, man.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.569
- Huh?
- Come. Come on, come on, come on,

09:14.571 --> 09:15.803
come on, come on, come on.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.105
- Come on!
- All right, all right.

09:19.942 --> 09:23.377
All right, check it out.

09:23.379 --> 09:25.847
Oh, my God.

09:25.849 --> 09:28.239
That's Bam-Bam.

09:28.372 --> 09:29.350
Yep.

09:29.352 --> 09:31.686
It's the man who looked
after me and believed in me.

09:31.688 --> 09:34.088
Bam-Bam, I love you, bruh.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.958
Boy, that's so big,
you could see it from...

09:36.960 --> 09:39.760
everywhere.

09:39.762 --> 09:42.597
I know, right? And behind
him is the Uptown I remember.

09:42.599 --> 09:44.432
You know, the Uptown where
you went grocery shopping

09:44.434 --> 09:46.067
at the liquor store, you know?

09:46.069 --> 09:47.401
The Uptown that set cars on fire

09:47.403 --> 09:49.937
when the Bulls won the championship.

09:49.939 --> 09:51.639
The good Uptown.

09:51.641 --> 09:53.007
Thanks for letting me do this, man.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.175
It means everything to me.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.510
Yeah, sure. Sure, kid.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.911
All right, I'll see you at work.

09:56.913 --> 09:58.513
Yeah.

09:59.982 --> 10:01.315
Huh.

10:01.317 --> 10:03.150
I didn't know he spelled "Bam-Ba""

10:03.152 --> 10:06.153
- with a gun.
- Yeah.

10:06.155 --> 10:07.488
Bad, isn't it?

10:07.490 --> 10:09.724
What? Having a gigantic gang member

10:09.726 --> 10:11.726
on the outside of your shop?

10:11.728 --> 10:13.628
In a city where it takes almost nothing

10:13.630 --> 10:15.796
for gang violence to erupt?

10:15.798 --> 10:19.233
Yeah, it's bad.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.719
Franco, the mural is absolutely amazing!

10:27.721 --> 10:28.753
Thank you, Maya.

10:28.755 --> 10:30.254
And the fact that the sun is setting

10:30.256 --> 10:32.490
in the east and the "L" train
is going in the wrong direction

10:32.492 --> 10:34.025
doesn't trigger my OCD at all.

10:34.027 --> 10:37.228
One, two, three, four, five,
touch your nose, sit down.

10:37.230 --> 10:41.265
You know, it's really inspiring
to see you chase your dream.

10:41.267 --> 10:44.102
Maybe I should get my old
bluegrass band back together.

10:44.104 --> 10:45.737
I didn't know you were in a band, Tush.

10:45.739 --> 10:46.904
Yeah.

10:46.906 --> 10:49.440
Had a band called Tush 'n' Jugs.

10:52.244 --> 10:53.811
I played the jug,

10:53.813 --> 10:56.514
and my ex-girlfriend
Barb had a great ass.

10:56.516 --> 10:57.949
Hmm.

10:57.951 --> 11:00.184
It feels so good to be
painting again, you know?

11:00.186 --> 11:01.652
Which, honestly, wouldn't be possible

11:01.654 --> 11:03.287
without Arthur encouraging me.

11:03.289 --> 11:04.889
Right, right.

11:06.865 --> 11:08.359
Arthur, don't you love the mural?

11:08.361 --> 11:09.827
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's great.

11:09.829 --> 11:11.662
It's too bad it's
gonna rain this weekend.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.831
Probably all get washed away.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.767
Do you know how paint works?

11:17.801 --> 11:19.704
Arthur, you have to come see
what's going on out there.

11:19.706 --> 11:21.472
- It's chaos!
- What are you talking about?

11:21.474 --> 11:22.740
There's a huge crowd of people

11:22.742 --> 11:24.275
in front of that gangster painting.

11:24.277 --> 11:27.845
They're hugging each other and
singing sad Boyz II Men songs.

11:27.847 --> 11:29.347
I got to check this out.

11:30.115 --> 11:31.649
You know Boyz II Men?

11:31.651 --> 11:33.951
Yes, when your country was
constantly invading my country,

11:33.953 --> 11:36.287
you left some of your CDs behind.

11:41.794 --> 11:43.394
Yo.

11:43.396 --> 11:45.296
Look at all these people!

11:45.298 --> 11:48.142
Wow, Franco, this is truly impressive.

11:48.213 --> 11:49.736
Yeah?

11:49.806 --> 11:51.369
It's so lifelike.

11:51.371 --> 11:55.306
Looks like he's mad at
something across the street.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.011
Franco, man, this is lit, man.

12:00.013 --> 12:01.145
Thanks, homie.

12:01.147 --> 12:02.773
Bam-Bam would have been so honored.

12:02.837 --> 12:04.003
Yeah.

12:04.195 --> 12:06.217
You really captured
his childlike whimsy.

12:06.219 --> 12:07.185
Hmm.

12:07.187 --> 12:09.487
Wow, Arthur.

12:09.489 --> 12:13.224
Your mural has really
attracted some nice people.

12:13.226 --> 12:17.562
There's a guy with a tattoo
of a face on his face.

12:17.564 --> 12:21.332
Someone's gonna get killed.

12:21.334 --> 12:24.502
Franco, whatever happened to
painting a nice bowl of fruit?

12:24.504 --> 12:27.566
Oh. I see we have a Cézanne fan.

12:28.253 --> 12:29.628
No, I just like fruit.

12:30.577 --> 12:32.410
Excuse me, Fawz.

12:32.412 --> 12:34.946
Excuse me, excuse me. Fawz,
you need to do something.

12:34.948 --> 12:37.215
This crowd is blocking
all of the foot traffic

12:37.217 --> 12:38.483
to Pretty Parchment.

12:38.485 --> 12:39.650
What's Pretty Parchment?

12:39.652 --> 12:42.086
- My gay paper store!
- Oh.

12:42.088 --> 12:45.156
You were elected to promote
the new face of Uptown,

12:45.158 --> 12:47.225
and this is not exactly
the face we had in mind.

12:47.227 --> 12:49.560
Now, don't make me demand a recall vote.

12:49.562 --> 12:50.895
Is that a threat?

12:50.897 --> 12:51.929
Yes.

12:51.931 --> 12:53.865
Okay, just confirming.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.167
Arthur!

12:56.169 --> 12:57.702
Everyone is very upset!

12:57.704 --> 12:59.070
This is your wall.

12:59.072 --> 13:00.605
You have to do something about it.

13:00.607 --> 13:01.939
What the hell do you want me to do?

13:01.941 --> 13:03.107
Uh, o-okay, okay.

13:03.109 --> 13:05.443
Let's go inside and
talk about it. Go on.

13:05.445 --> 13:08.422
James, make sure things
don't get out of control.

13:08.625 --> 13:08.980
Okay.

13:08.982 --> 13:11.015
Keep it moving, please.

13:11.017 --> 13:12.884
Do not block the street or sidewalk.

13:12.886 --> 13:15.920
No, no, no. You-you have
to show some authority.

13:15.922 --> 13:17.522
Use your tough voice.

13:17.524 --> 13:20.358
Right, right.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.993
Keep it moving.

13:21.995 --> 13:24.795
Please do not block
the street or sidewalk.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.901
That painting has got to come down.

13:29.903 --> 13:31.369
Yeah, he's right.

13:31.371 --> 13:33.471
It doesn't take much
for gatherings like that

13:33.473 --> 13:34.972
to get violent.

13:34.974 --> 13:36.541
And people can get hurt.

13:36.543 --> 13:38.075
Yes, as commandant

13:38.077 --> 13:40.411
of the Business Council, I must insist.

13:40.413 --> 13:42.279
Commandant?

13:43.498 --> 13:45.265
"President" was a little blah,

13:45.294 --> 13:48.252
and-and "Generalissimo" was too ethnic.

13:48.254 --> 13:50.354
- Oh...
- Look,

13:50.356 --> 13:51.989
the neighborhood is changing.

13:51.991 --> 13:53.391
New stores are moving in,

13:53.393 --> 13:54.825
and they don't want to lose business

13:54.827 --> 13:57.319
- because of scary images like that.
- You're right.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.577
That's the Uptown that we're
trying to leave in the past.

13:59.678 --> 14:01.206
I get it, I get it.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.442
But I-I just encouraged the
kid to start painting again.

14:03.444 --> 14:06.044
So how am I gonna tell
him to get rid of it?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.513
What if he doesn't have
to take it down altogether?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.649
Maybe he can just make a few changes.

14:10.651 --> 14:12.851
He better. Otherwise,
there's a city ordinance

14:12.853 --> 14:15.084
that prohibits incendiary
public displays.

14:15.331 --> 14:16.297
Really?

14:16.631 --> 14:18.430
I'm not sure, but it sounds good.

14:18.432 --> 14:20.166
- Mm.
- Well, you know,

14:20.168 --> 14:22.001
actually, the city can take it down

14:22.003 --> 14:24.069
if there are enough complaints.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.772
That was amazing, man. I'm
like a celebrity out there.

14:26.774 --> 14:28.407
I got my first groupie.

14:29.377 --> 14:31.510
Hey, Miss Dolores!

14:31.512 --> 14:34.513
- She grabbed my ass when she hugged me.
- Oh...

14:36.449 --> 14:38.350
Franco, I'm glad she likes it.

14:38.352 --> 14:41.921
But your art project has caused
a big problem for your boss.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.255
What's she talking about?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.090
Well, you see, Fawz says the...

14:45.092 --> 14:46.771
the mural maybe has to come down.

14:46.857 --> 14:48.294
Not maybe, baby.

14:48.357 --> 14:50.583
We are going to get a city order.

14:50.654 --> 14:52.053
O-Okay, but we can fight that, right?

14:52.055 --> 14:53.521
Well, uh, maybe it would be easier

14:53.523 --> 14:55.156
if you just make a few tiny changes.

14:55.158 --> 14:56.824
- Changes like what?
- Well, I mean,

14:56.826 --> 14:58.826
you can change that pot leaf on his hat

14:58.828 --> 15:00.261
to a four-leaf clover.

15:00.263 --> 15:02.363
And, um...

15:02.365 --> 15:06.067
a-and turn the gun into a rainbow.

15:06.069 --> 15:08.848
I-It's a painting, not
a box of Lucky Charms.

15:08.922 --> 15:10.020
Well...

15:10.974 --> 15:13.508
If you really want to symbolize Uptown,

15:13.510 --> 15:16.411
perhaps you could, uh, do
a portrait of its leader.

15:16.413 --> 15:18.121
Uh...

15:20.582 --> 15:24.452
Maybe, maybe standing like this.

15:24.454 --> 15:28.523
You know, with-with jets
flying overhead or...

15:28.525 --> 15:30.491
maybe an eagle.

15:31.460 --> 15:35.430
Look, Franco, you are
a very talented artist,

15:35.432 --> 15:39.200
but to put a convicted criminal
on the side of a building,

15:39.202 --> 15:41.869
you cannot expect to
make everybody happy.

15:41.871 --> 15:45.273
It's art. It's not supposed
to make everybody happy.

15:46.108 --> 15:47.508
I got work to do.

15:54.283 --> 15:57.585
Hey, come on, kid, why...
why are you so stubborn?

15:57.587 --> 15:59.754
If you make a little change,
everyone will be happy.

15:59.756 --> 16:01.356
Except me!

16:01.358 --> 16:03.024
Like, why aren't you
helping me fight 'em on this?

16:03.026 --> 16:04.692
Because I agree with them.

16:04.694 --> 16:06.327
What?

16:06.329 --> 16:08.096
You said you liked it.

16:08.098 --> 16:10.965
Technically, I said, "Oh, my God."

16:12.801 --> 16:14.902
Oh, my God.

16:14.904 --> 16:17.171
Hey, look, look, I run a business here.

16:17.173 --> 16:18.406
I sell donuts.

16:18.408 --> 16:19.640
I don't want any trouble.

16:19.642 --> 16:21.142
That guy was a gang member.

16:21.144 --> 16:22.777
I'm sick of y'all saying that.

16:22.779 --> 16:25.146
That was only one
side of him, all right?

16:25.148 --> 16:27.181
Haven't you considered,
like, without Bam-Bam,

16:27.183 --> 16:28.850
I wouldn't be here right now?

16:28.852 --> 16:30.618
I'd probably be locked up.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.687
Or worse.

16:34.156 --> 16:36.424
Franco, I've been thinking.

16:36.426 --> 16:38.626
It doesn't have to be an eagle!

16:38.628 --> 16:40.328
It could be a dragon.

16:50.032 --> 16:51.733
Oh, boy.

16:51.735 --> 16:55.437
So much for the Tush
'n' Jugs reunion tour.

16:55.439 --> 16:56.705
What happened?

16:56.707 --> 16:58.173
Barb isn't interested.

16:58.175 --> 17:00.809
She's made a life for
herself out in Kankakee,

17:00.811 --> 17:04.878
working the T-shirt cannon
for the Kane County Cougars.

17:04.881 --> 17:06.548
I guess I was

17:06.550 --> 17:10.484
just a rung on her show business ladder.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.887
Which way was she climbing?

17:16.092 --> 17:17.325
What's all that?

17:17.327 --> 17:18.693
Fawz's council convinced the city

17:18.694 --> 17:20.428
to paint over Franco's mural.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.896
They're about to start, so
I just grabbed all this stuff

17:22.898 --> 17:24.733
- from the shrine.
- Mm.

17:24.734 --> 17:27.102
Wasn't there a giant
teddy bear out there?

17:27.104 --> 17:30.038
Oh, I brought that home for my lady.

17:31.073 --> 17:33.742
Fine. I get scared at night.

17:33.744 --> 17:34.876
Yeah, all right.

17:34.878 --> 17:37.078
Hey, Franco, want to
go out there with me

17:37.080 --> 17:39.347
and take one last look at the mural?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.782
Nah.

17:40.784 --> 17:42.584
I already lost Bam-Bam once this week.

17:42.586 --> 17:44.452
I ain't trying to do that again.

17:47.390 --> 17:49.257
Kid seems pretty down.

17:49.259 --> 17:52.060
I wish I knew what to do.

17:52.062 --> 17:54.696
Wow. Look at all these cards.

17:54.698 --> 17:57.065
Bam-Bam really helped a lot of people.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.634
I guess there was a
whole other side to him.

17:59.636 --> 18:01.669
It sucks that Fawz's council

18:01.671 --> 18:03.638
has all the influence
in this neighborhood now.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.907
What about the people that grew up here?

18:05.909 --> 18:08.476
They should have a voice.

18:09.378 --> 18:11.079
They do.

18:11.081 --> 18:12.747
It's Franco.

18:16.152 --> 18:17.519
Now take a picture of me

18:17.521 --> 18:19.120
to document my first great achievement

18:19.122 --> 18:21.322
as leader of the Fawz
Neighborhood Council.

18:21.324 --> 18:23.958
That's not what it's called.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.494
It is now, by executive order.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.763
We don't have those.

18:28.765 --> 18:32.300
We do now, that was my
first executive order.

18:33.702 --> 18:35.837
Hey! Don't touch that wall!

18:35.839 --> 18:37.238
That painting stays.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.574
What are you talking about?
I thought you didn't like it.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.643
I don't. I hate it,
like a lot of people.

18:41.645 --> 18:43.244
But a lot of other people like it.

18:43.246 --> 18:44.379
They think it's great!

18:44.381 --> 18:45.847
This mural has touched a nerve,

18:45.849 --> 18:49.050
and isn't that what
art is all about, hmm?

18:49.052 --> 18:51.653
Well, it's too late.
The council has spoken.

18:51.655 --> 18:53.121
Oh, yeah? For whom, huh?

18:53.123 --> 18:55.390
I know this is not your vision
of this neighborhood, yeah,

18:55.392 --> 18:57.692
but his vision is
just as valid as yours.

18:57.694 --> 18:59.427
So I'm gonna fight that city order.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.629
Because Bam-Bam was part
of this neighborhood.

19:01.631 --> 19:04.799
And you can't just whitewash that away.

19:11.941 --> 19:14.309
I guess they can whitewash it away.

19:14.311 --> 19:15.343
Hmm.

19:15.345 --> 19:18.012
I can't look at this.

19:18.014 --> 19:21.416
Aw, kid, I'm sorry.

19:23.285 --> 19:25.353
Yeah, it sucks.

19:25.355 --> 19:27.355
But I do appreciate you having my back.

19:27.357 --> 19:29.324
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

19:29.326 --> 19:33.194
That speech you gave was badass.

19:33.196 --> 19:35.897
I thought somebody was
gonna assassinate you.

19:35.899 --> 19:38.533
Or you were gonna fall off the curb.

19:38.535 --> 19:41.503
Yeah, I almost did.

19:43.003 --> 19:44.906
You know, now that I
have a new blank canvas,

19:44.908 --> 19:46.774
I'm already thinking
about my next piece.

19:46.776 --> 19:48.009
- Hey, really?
- Yeah.

19:48.011 --> 19:49.644
Okay, so what's the subject?

19:49.646 --> 19:50.678
A'ight, picture this:

19:50.680 --> 19:52.180
it's a Black Jesus... Black Jesus...

19:52.182 --> 19:53.681
- ... riding a skateboard...
- Ooh.

19:53.683 --> 19:55.583
... holding a rocket launcher.

19:57.119 --> 19:59.787
Can't you just paint a bowl of fruit?

20:02.755 --> 20:05.268
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Arthur.

20:07.825 --> 20:08.825
What are you doing?

20:08.827 --> 20:10.427
Uh, Tush is now my food taster.

20:10.429 --> 20:14.798
You know, I've made some enemies
in my first 48 hours in office.

20:14.804 --> 20:17.686
Not the whole thing, man!

20:19.956 --> 20:22.772
Huh. Well, if it ain't
Chicago's finest art critic.

20:22.774 --> 20:27.010
I did something nice for you,
so don't make me regret it.

20:27.012 --> 20:30.347
I took a picture of your
mural before it came down.

20:30.349 --> 20:32.382
Oh. Thank you, Randy.

20:32.384 --> 20:34.584
Come here. Mwah.

20:34.586 --> 20:36.653
You even framed it.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.221
Yeah, I'm a Chicago cop.

20:38.223 --> 20:40.857
Framing's what I do best.
