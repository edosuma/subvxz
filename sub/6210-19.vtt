WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:03.368
Salem, look at
this old photo I found.

00:03.369 --> 00:04.435
( laughs ):
Photos?

00:04.436 --> 00:06.004
I was framed, I tell you.

00:06.005 --> 00:08.640
How was I supposed to know
she was married?

00:08.641 --> 00:11.276
It's not of you, it's of some
creepy, old relative.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.178
Maybe she can help me
figure out the family secret

00:13.179 --> 00:15.113
so I can finally
get my witch's license.

00:18.384 --> 00:21.119
Hi, I'm Sabrina.
I'm sorry to bother you,

00:21.120 --> 00:23.021
but I was trying
to figure out the family secret,

00:23.022 --> 00:24.589
and I was wondering
if you knew it.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.491
Well,
you didn't hear it from me,

00:26.492 --> 00:29.527
but while your Uncle Rupert
was in prison for embezzling,

00:29.528 --> 00:32.063
his wife was having an affair
with Rupert's brother Sinclair.

00:32.064 --> 00:33.765
But the explosion
wasn't his fault--

00:33.766 --> 00:35.634
Whoa! So the Spellmans
aren't the boring,

00:35.635 --> 00:37.869
pathetic losers
they've been made out to be?

00:37.870 --> 00:39.270
Good morning,
Sabrina and...

00:39.271 --> 00:41.172
Sabrina's oddly-dressed friend.

00:41.173 --> 00:42.774
Dear,
I've told you,

00:42.775 --> 00:45.142
when they come to the door just
take the pamphlet and smile.

00:45.143 --> 00:46.444
Don't let them in.

00:46.445 --> 00:47.979
Don't you know
who this is?

00:47.980 --> 00:50.649
You found the stuff I bought
at the flea market yesterday.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.116
A complete stranger--

00:52.117 --> 00:53.551
SALEM:
But she doesn't have to be.

00:53.552 --> 00:55.286
Hello.

00:55.287 --> 00:56.288
( screams )

00:57.456 --> 01:02.928
--who's now going to sue us.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.863
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.676 --> 01:19.143
Tonight's show is full
of belly laughs.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.418
Ooh.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.119
Sabrina, aren't you afraid
( sighs )

01:28.120 --> 01:30.488
if you keep studying for this
Brainbusters competition,

01:30.489 --> 01:32.290
your whole head's
gonna explode?

01:32.291 --> 01:33.991
Don't want to embarrass
myself on Saturday,

01:33.992 --> 01:35.760
in front of the entire school.

01:35.761 --> 01:37.962
Must be a horrible feeling
to look like an idiot

01:37.963 --> 01:40.966
in front of an auditorium
full of people.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.667
Not that that would happen.

01:42.668 --> 01:43.534
Cheese puff?

01:43.535 --> 01:45.170
Oh, I'd love one.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.105
Are they hiding
underneath those things?

01:47.106 --> 01:49.341
These are my contributions to my
first cheerleader bake sale,

01:49.342 --> 01:50.775
and nobody's buying them.

01:50.776 --> 01:52.210
Come on, Birkhead.

01:52.211 --> 01:53.844
Move some merchandise,

01:53.845 --> 01:56.481
or you'll be spit-shining
my pom-poms.

01:56.482 --> 01:57.983
( sniffs )

01:57.984 --> 02:00.652
Ooh, Are they supposed
to smell like feet?

02:00.653 --> 02:02.521
You smell it too?
Help.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.422
It's all in the marketing.
Here, have a cheese puff.

02:04.423 --> 02:06.324
It'll freshen your breath,
whiten your teeth,

02:06.325 --> 02:07.893
and clear up your acne.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.693
The public's so gullible.

02:09.695 --> 02:12.063
Our neighbor, Mr. Tobias,

02:12.064 --> 02:14.632
is the most infuriating man
on the planet.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.534
He ran over
our trash can again.

02:16.535 --> 02:18.837
That was my favorite
trash can.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.306
( sobbing ):
You can't buy
memories like that.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.112
That's not the trash can
I was thinking of.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.147
I am sick of his behavior,

02:29.148 --> 02:30.849
and I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.118
Let's destroy everything
that's dear to him.

02:33.119 --> 02:36.988
( British accent ):
Let's indoctrinate him into
the cathedral of agony.

02:36.989 --> 02:39.624
I'm gonna write him
a very stern letter.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.793
You're a regular Mad Max,
aren't you?

02:46.565 --> 02:48.900
( scoffs )

02:48.901 --> 02:50.902
Hilda, what are you doing?

02:50.903 --> 02:52.103
Isn't she a pip?

02:52.104 --> 02:54.405
I bought it at a yard sale
for 75 cents.

02:54.406 --> 02:56.741
And they threw in
this cool farmer's hat.

02:56.742 --> 02:58.943
Why do you insist on
cluttering up our house

02:58.944 --> 03:01.146
with useless junk
from flea markets?

03:01.147 --> 03:02.247
Junk?

03:02.248 --> 03:04.148
You bought Sabrina
those encyclopedias.

03:04.149 --> 03:06.618
Until you can prove to me
that you can actually use

03:06.619 --> 03:09.821
this...monstrosity--

03:09.822 --> 03:12.557
I'm using it right now.
I'm going to the store.

03:12.558 --> 03:14.025
Do you need anything?

03:14.026 --> 03:15.693
Cheese actually
makes you appear taller.

03:15.694 --> 03:17.128
Okay. Places, Brainbusters.

03:17.129 --> 03:18.863
This is not the food court
at the mall.

03:18.864 --> 03:20.865
Okay, "The Dordogne river
meets the sea

03:20.866 --> 03:22.099
at which port city
in France?"

03:22.100 --> 03:23.602
Sheldon.
Bordeaux

03:23.603 --> 03:26.337
Yes. "The cluster of stars
in the constellation Orion."

03:26.338 --> 03:28.273
Sabrina?
The seven sisters.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.242
Wrong.
Oh, correct.

03:31.243 --> 03:33.812
"Define Newton's theory
of gravitational force." Perry.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.749
Yes, that's what it is,
but I need it in words.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.617
"Neanderthals lived in Europe

03:39.618 --> 03:40.985
during what period," Maggie?

03:42.588 --> 03:44.289
Look out. Coming through.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.728
I don't mean
to be an alarmist,

03:49.729 --> 03:51.596
but shouldn't we be wearing
HAZMAT suits?

03:51.597 --> 03:52.464
It's food poisoning.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.966
Or should I say puff poisoning?

03:54.967 --> 03:56.634
They're all going to be laid up
for at least a week

03:56.635 --> 03:59.003
thanks to you
and your accomplice

03:59.004 --> 04:01.539
Valerie "Sweeney Todd"
Birkhead.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.708
Valerie would never wish
kidney failure on anyone.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.543
Well, I'm not blaming Valerie.

04:05.544 --> 04:07.345
I'm blaming you.

04:07.346 --> 04:09.313
You've been trying to sabotage
this competition,

04:09.314 --> 04:11.783
because you know how important
it is to my career.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.452
You don't want to see me
make principal.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.221
Well, however true
that statement is,

04:16.221 --> 04:17.255
I had nothing to do--

04:17.255 --> 04:19.257
Ah, but it's not
going to work, young lady,

04:19.257 --> 04:21.024
and I am holding you
responsible

04:21.026 --> 04:23.795
for having another team
ready by Saturday.

04:23.796 --> 04:27.732
And if you don't, you're going
to see my ugly side.

04:30.535 --> 04:32.203
You mean it gets uglier?

04:33.572 --> 04:35.640
Yes, I know it's tough
competition, Gordie.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.942
Yeah, it's Saturday morning.

04:37.943 --> 04:39.778
Yeah, I know we don't have much
time to prepare,

04:39.779 --> 04:41.045
but I think it'll be fun.

04:41.046 --> 04:42.046
( <i>dial tone</i> )

04:42.047 --> 04:44.215
Hello?

04:44.216 --> 04:45.717
Great.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.519
I've called everyone
on the honor roll,

04:47.520 --> 04:48.753
in the Science Club,

04:48.754 --> 04:50.754
and all the students
that wear glasses.

04:50.755 --> 04:52.590
Now what, Aunt Hilda?

04:52.591 --> 04:54.558
You know, I'm sorry, Sabrina.
I'd love to help you,

04:54.559 --> 04:56.093
but I've got to go
flip the mattresses.

05:01.032 --> 05:02.033
No.
No.

05:02.034 --> 05:03.167
Well, come on.

05:03.168 --> 05:04.769
Valerie, you have
to be a Brainbuster.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.337
This whole nightmare
can be traced back

05:06.338 --> 05:07.505
to your mixing bowl.

05:07.506 --> 05:08.840
No, but I freeze under pressure.

05:08.841 --> 05:11.008
I-I get dizzy,
I sweat profusely,

05:11.009 --> 05:12.677
and I babble incoherently.

05:12.678 --> 05:14.179
Much like I'm doing now.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.680
Harvey, you have to do it.

05:15.681 --> 05:16.815
You're my boyfriend.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.783
Sure, you say that now.

05:18.784 --> 05:20.584
Wait till they ask me
a question I don't know.

05:20.585 --> 05:22.987
Then all of a sudden
it's "who brought the dumb guy?"

05:24.123 --> 05:25.523
Look, I really need your help.

05:27.392 --> 05:29.794
Okay, okay.
You guilted us into it.

05:29.795 --> 05:30.895
Don't we need one more?

05:30.896 --> 05:32.831
Unfortunately.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.567
You want me to do you a favor?

05:35.568 --> 05:38.236
What's the sudden fascination
with pronouns?

05:38.237 --> 05:39.937
I don't know if you were
recently hit in the head

05:39.938 --> 05:41.573
with an asteroid,

05:41.574 --> 05:43.842
but the day
that I do a freak a favor--

05:43.843 --> 05:46.644
Is everything
okay here, ladies?

05:46.645 --> 05:48.145
We're fine. Um.
Libby just volunteered

05:48.146 --> 05:49.514
to be a Brainbuster,

05:49.515 --> 05:50.982
but I don't know
if that's a good idea.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.951
But I-- I--

05:52.952 --> 05:55.086
I think it's a splendid idea.

05:55.087 --> 05:58.556
If Libby wants to be on
the team, then she's on it.

05:58.557 --> 06:00.692
Darn it, Libby.
You get your way again.

06:01.760 --> 06:02.727
( chuckling )

06:02.728 --> 06:03.961
Mr. Tobias responded

06:03.962 --> 06:06.164
to my perfectly reasonable
and rational letter

06:06.165 --> 06:07.298
by doing this.

06:07.299 --> 06:10.802
A hunk of metal?
He shouldn't have.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.903
No, it's our mailbox.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.875
Well, I have two words
for Mr. Tobias:

06:17.876 --> 06:19.309
water balloons,

06:19.310 --> 06:20.411
aimed at his house,

06:20.412 --> 06:22.280
on the hour, every hour.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.249
I realize that's more
than two words.

06:24.250 --> 06:28.186
No, Salem, I refuse to stoop
to that Neanderthal's level.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.122
Quick, I need a spell to help
fill Harvey, Valerie,

06:31.123 --> 06:33.691
and Libby's brains with,
well, brains.

06:33.692 --> 06:37.128
Sabrina, you know spells to make
people smarter are illegal.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.696
Well,
it's not that they're stupid--

06:38.697 --> 06:40.130
Except maybe Libby.

06:40.131 --> 06:42.032
--it's just that they lack
confidence--

06:42.033 --> 06:44.335
Except maybe Libby.
Is there a spell that would

06:44.336 --> 06:46.838
help them tap into the knowledge
they already have?

06:46.839 --> 06:49.273
There's a "find your
full potential" spell,

06:49.274 --> 06:50.942
and it's okay to use on mortals.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.644
Witness Mark McGwire.

06:52.645 --> 06:53.645
Perfect.

06:53.646 --> 06:54.912
But there's a catch:

06:54.913 --> 06:56.281
you need your witch's license.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.048
But I can't get
my stupid license

06:58.049 --> 07:00.885
until I figure out
the stupid family secret.

07:00.886 --> 07:02.953
I don't believe it.

07:02.954 --> 07:06.157
Tobias is spying on us
with a telescope.

07:06.158 --> 07:09.027
Some people have
no moral compass.

07:09.028 --> 07:09.994
Salem, you've got to help me.

07:09.995 --> 07:11.195
I've got to get my license.

07:11.196 --> 07:13.198
Don't you know anything
about the family secret?

07:13.199 --> 07:15.033
Oh, Sabrina, you know
what you could do for me?

07:15.034 --> 07:16.734
Order this
water-balloon catapult

07:16.735 --> 07:18.603
from Abercrombie & Witch.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.839
No. Isn't there
some distant relative

07:20.840 --> 07:21.872
nobody ever talks about?

07:21.873 --> 07:23.307
You know, like, the black sheep?

07:23.308 --> 07:25.543
Hm. Well,
there is your Aunt Dorma.

07:25.544 --> 07:27.378
Dorma?
I've never heard of her.

07:27.379 --> 07:29.914
Hence the secret part.

07:29.915 --> 07:33.952
Yes! Tobias and the paper
just headed into the loo.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.887
That should give me enough
time to TP his house.

07:36.888 --> 07:38.022
( chuckling )

07:38.023 --> 07:40.425
<i>Aunt Dorma,</i>
<i>pick up your crystal ball,</i>

07:40.426 --> 07:42.260
<i>reverse the charges</i>
<i>on this call.</i>

07:42.261 --> 07:44.829
DORMA ( over ball ):
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>I was sound asleep.</i>

07:44.830 --> 07:46.630
It's Sabrina Spellman,
your niece.

07:46.631 --> 07:47.665
I'm sorry to bother you.

07:47.666 --> 07:48.966
I just wanted
to ask you a question

07:48.967 --> 07:50.434
about the family secret.

07:50.435 --> 07:52.537
<i>No one wakes up Dorma</i>
<i>and gets away with it.</i>

07:52.538 --> 07:54.772
<i>You'll rue the day you--</i>
Sorry, wrong number.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.440
( <i>dial tone</i> )

07:56.441 --> 08:00.078
Well, I really hope her crystal
ball doesn't have star-69.

08:01.346 --> 08:03.347
Is the family secret
about Aunt Dorma?

08:03.348 --> 08:04.716
Absolutely not.

08:04.717 --> 08:05.917
And don't contact her.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.985
She sleeps for 10 years
at a time.

08:07.986 --> 08:09.888
The last thing you'd ever
want to do is wake her up.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.055
ZELDA:
I did once,

08:11.056 --> 08:13.558
and she turned me
into a porch swing.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.693
Promise me you won't go back up
to your room and call her.

08:15.694 --> 08:17.161
I promise.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.699
Okay. "The first woman
to be elected

08:21.700 --> 08:23.635
to both the house
and the senate."

08:23.636 --> 08:24.836
Oh, that's--

08:24.837 --> 08:28.306
Somebody else besides
the queen of the lucky guesses?

08:28.307 --> 08:29.874
Anyone?
Oh! Oh, I know this one!

08:29.875 --> 08:30.975
Yes, Miss Birkhead.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.576
Oh, don't tell me.

08:32.577 --> 08:33.577
Um.

08:33.578 --> 08:34.511
Mr. Kinkle?

08:34.513 --> 08:37.482
Can I just drop and give you 20?

08:38.283 --> 08:39.350
Libby.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.118
I told you I'm only here
to field

08:41.119 --> 08:43.221
the fashion and hair questions.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.588
Oh! Uh, no.

08:44.589 --> 08:46.958
Just a second.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.093
The answer
is Margaret Chase Smith.

08:49.094 --> 08:50.862
Really? I didn't know that.

08:52.464 --> 08:56.534
Well, this is an unmitigated
disaster.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.869
Miss Spellman,
you will have plenty of time

08:58.870 --> 09:01.906
to think about what you
have done to me in detention.

09:01.907 --> 09:03.341
Oh, no, no, no.
It's going to be fine.

09:03.342 --> 09:04.575
I promise.
All we need to do

09:04.576 --> 09:06.678
is have an all-night
cram session at my house.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.346
( <i>funky theme playing</i> )

09:13.919 --> 09:16.521
They just need
to study a little.

09:16.522 --> 09:18.255
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda.

09:18.256 --> 09:19.891
I'm having some people
over to study.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.159
Do we have any-- Snacks.

09:23.395 --> 09:24.528
Aunt Hilda?

09:24.529 --> 09:25.697
Are you all right?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.165
Aunt Hilda?
( snoring )

09:27.166 --> 09:29.534
Come on, wake up.
Rise and shine.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.035
Look, a garage sale!

09:31.036 --> 09:32.270
( snoring )

09:32.271 --> 09:34.672
Poppies?

09:34.673 --> 09:37.007
They're for me, from Aunt Dorma.

09:37.008 --> 09:38.643
Something tells me
this is not

09:38.644 --> 09:40.511
the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

09:40.512 --> 09:43.013
Aunt Zelda,
we've got a huge problem.

09:43.014 --> 09:44.782
Poppies.

09:44.783 --> 09:45.883
Wha--?

09:45.884 --> 09:48.019
What's happening?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.253
Where did you get those flowers?

09:49.254 --> 09:52.557
Other realm poppies
are lethal to Spellmans.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.359
( snoring )
Aunt Dorma!

09:54.360 --> 09:55.826
You didn't wake her up, did you?

09:55.827 --> 09:56.894
Yes, I woke her up.

09:56.895 --> 09:58.562
Now help me get Aunt Zelda
to the couch.

09:58.563 --> 10:00.497
Sure. I'll grab her shoe.

10:02.701 --> 10:04.902
Just wanted to have
some people over to study.

10:04.903 --> 10:06.470
A few minutes ago,
my biggest worry was

10:06.471 --> 10:08.706
that we didn't have
enough pizza rolls.

10:08.707 --> 10:12.977
But no. Some crazy aunt sends
a bunch of-- Poppies!

10:12.978 --> 10:14.578
I got to get rid of them.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.218
Oh, no.

10:21.219 --> 10:22.720
Dorma must have put a spell
on my finger

10:22.721 --> 10:24.722
so I can't zap the poppies away.

10:24.723 --> 10:26.023
What am I going to do?

10:26.024 --> 10:27.491
( doorbell rings )

10:27.492 --> 10:30.227
Of course. Wait two seconds
for things to get even worse.

10:30.228 --> 10:32.196
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

10:36.267 --> 10:39.570
( knocking on door )

10:39.571 --> 10:41.505
We don't want any cookies.
Religious reasons.

10:42.307 --> 10:43.507
Do you mind?

10:43.508 --> 10:44.675
We're supposed
to be studying,

10:44.676 --> 10:46.210
not standing out here
on your doormat,

10:46.211 --> 10:48.713
which, by the way,
feels cheap.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.181
Oh, well,
you'll have to go around back.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.248
The door is stuck,

10:51.249 --> 10:52.583
this is as far
as I can get it open.

10:52.584 --> 10:53.517
Well, I've got an idea.

10:53.518 --> 10:54.919
What if the three of us
all push on--?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.788
You want a war, Tobias?
You got one.

10:57.789 --> 11:00.057
Just put your head
between your legs

11:00.058 --> 11:03.093
and kiss your sweet little--
Hey!

11:03.094 --> 11:04.528
You know, I don't hang up
the phone on you

11:04.529 --> 11:06.496
when you're threatening
complete strangers.

11:06.497 --> 11:07.798
Salem, you've got to help me.

11:07.799 --> 11:10.267
What else do you remember
about the poison poppy spells?

11:10.268 --> 11:11.769
Let's see.
From what I remember,

11:11.770 --> 11:14.071
you have to remove
the poppies from the house,

11:14.072 --> 11:16.541
or everyone affected by them
will sleep for eternity

11:16.542 --> 11:20.244
while their minds and bodies
rot slowly into nothingness.

11:20.245 --> 11:21.578
But I can't. Every time I try

11:21.579 --> 11:23.180
my finger just makes
more poppies.

11:23.181 --> 11:25.116
Mm. That's a twist.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.984
But if you can keep Hilda
and Zelda moving,

11:26.985 --> 11:29.286
you can delay
the decaying process.

11:29.287 --> 11:31.555
( yawning ):
How am I supposed to do that?

11:31.556 --> 11:33.223
Wait a second.
I'm falling asleep too.

11:33.224 --> 11:34.792
Don't worry. You're half mortal.

11:34.793 --> 11:37.861
They'll probably just make you
drowsy for a few hundred years.

11:37.862 --> 11:40.064
Oh, good. I was afraid
it was something serious.

11:40.065 --> 11:41.331
( knocking on door )

11:41.332 --> 11:43.267
Sabrina, I can't believe
I'm saying this:

11:43.268 --> 11:44.835
let me into your house.

11:47.272 --> 11:48.773
( snickers )

11:48.774 --> 11:50.841
What's with
all the poppies?

11:50.842 --> 11:53.611
Our greenhouse broke.
You have a greenhouse?

11:53.612 --> 11:55.846
Did you guys come over to study
or to ask questions?

11:55.847 --> 11:58.315
We certainly didn't come here
to socialize.

11:58.316 --> 12:00.918
Can we please go into the living
room and get this over with?

12:00.919 --> 12:02.286
Oh, no.
Uh, we can't go in there.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.589
The pipes burst
and the place is flooded.

12:05.958 --> 12:09.059
Oh, I think I speak
for all of us: ew.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.028
Why don't you guys just stay
here and start studying

12:11.029 --> 12:14.865
and I'll be back before
you can say "rampant mildew."

12:14.866 --> 12:18.268
Okay. I've got to keep Aunt
Hilda and Aunt Zelda moving.

12:18.269 --> 12:20.404
Um, to keep my aunts from
spending an eternity in bed,

12:20.405 --> 12:22.072
make them act out
what's currently

12:22.073 --> 12:23.173
going through their heads.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.049
Finally, I got past
the doorman at studio 54.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.385
I'm almost across the channel.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.487
I can see Calais.

12:36.488 --> 12:37.588
This is what they dream of?

12:37.589 --> 12:39.990
It's a wonder I turned
out normal at all.

12:39.991 --> 12:41.692
( yawning ):
What was I doing?

12:41.693 --> 12:43.127
Right!

12:43.128 --> 12:44.962
Hey, Sabrina,
we need your help.

12:44.963 --> 12:47.331
Maybe you should spend less time
talking and more studying.

12:47.332 --> 12:49.633
Take that, Tobias.

12:49.634 --> 12:51.536
( glass shattering )

12:51.537 --> 12:54.237
Ooh. Stained glass window.

12:54.238 --> 12:55.639
Expensive.

12:56.908 --> 12:58.409
Salem, what are you doing?

12:58.410 --> 12:59.543
Why aren't you helping me?

12:59.544 --> 13:00.911
Bigger fish to fry.

13:00.912 --> 13:02.780
Isn't she a beaut?

13:02.781 --> 13:03.881
Zelda was asleep

13:03.882 --> 13:06.283
so I borrowed her credit card.

13:06.284 --> 13:07.651
There's got to be something
in here

13:07.652 --> 13:10.187
about getting rid of poppies.

13:10.188 --> 13:12.289
Let's see.

13:12.290 --> 13:15.026
"Paprika, uses of." No.

13:15.027 --> 13:19.997
"Pod people, humor of." No.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.699
Salem!

13:22.700 --> 13:24.068
Don't hate me.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.436
I only did it

13:25.437 --> 13:27.204
( sobbing ):
because I love you.

13:27.205 --> 13:29.273
Ah. Here it is.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.808
"Poppy cleanup.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.143
Press here for fast, efficient,
friendly service."

13:33.144 --> 13:34.679
Finally. Something easy.

13:36.881 --> 13:38.649
Can't they eat any faster?

13:38.650 --> 13:39.883
Oh, yeah, well,

13:39.884 --> 13:42.052
we just came from a job
at a garbage dump

13:42.053 --> 13:43.353
and they're kind of full.

13:43.354 --> 13:44.488
KRAFT:
Sabrina.

13:45.623 --> 13:47.457
Mr. Kraft,
what are you doing here?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.894
I just came by to make sure
you were studying.

13:49.895 --> 13:50.961
Why do I feel like I just walked

13:50.962 --> 13:53.263
into the middle
of a Fellini film?

13:53.264 --> 13:55.299
You are a wonderful dancer,
Mr. Warhol.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.534
Where are my notes?

13:56.535 --> 13:58.569
I've got to give a lecture
in ten minutes.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.370
Zelda--
SABRINA: Oh, don't mind her.

14:00.371 --> 14:02.173
She's just experiencing
a bit of dementia.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.341
All that research. And for what?

14:04.342 --> 14:05.609
Oh, I understand.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.711
This is one of your experiments.

14:07.712 --> 14:11.449
My pants. My pants?
Where are my pants?

14:11.450 --> 14:12.817
You are wearing them.

14:12.818 --> 14:15.453
You know, you really
are overworking yourself.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.187
Now, my advice to you?

14:17.188 --> 14:19.890
Start taking care of Zelda.

14:19.891 --> 14:22.493
Great suggestion. We've got
to get back to studying now.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.627
Uh, thanks for coming by.

14:25.596 --> 14:26.997
SALEM:
Take that, Tobias.

14:26.998 --> 14:28.832
SALEM:
Hey.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.634
( yelling )

14:30.635 --> 14:32.502
HARVEY:
Sabrina, is it okay
to come out now?

14:32.503 --> 14:34.805
Harvey, no, uh,
you'll ruin your shoes.

14:34.806 --> 14:35.973
( shepherd whistles )

14:35.974 --> 14:38.042
Okay, boys. Take five.

14:39.444 --> 14:40.811
It's a union thing.

14:40.812 --> 14:42.346
You know,
just get the goats out of here.

14:42.347 --> 14:43.881
I'll get rid
of the poppies myself.

14:43.882 --> 14:46.750
And people wonder
why shepherds are loners.

14:47.619 --> 14:49.620
Hey, what's going on?

14:49.621 --> 14:51.188
We heard some strange
noises in there.

14:51.189 --> 14:53.390
It sounded like goats.
Goats.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.192
Ha, ha, you guys have been
studying too long.

14:55.193 --> 14:57.227
SHEPHERD:
Come on, goats. Time to go home.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.097
So how's the studying going?

15:00.098 --> 15:01.932
Miserably.
Will you help us?

15:01.933 --> 15:03.700
You don't need me.
You got everything you need.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.001
You're smart and you have books.

15:05.002 --> 15:06.736
So you're not going to help us.

15:06.737 --> 15:08.739
I would, but I just have
more work to do,

15:08.740 --> 15:10.407
you know, mostly mopping.

15:10.408 --> 15:11.575
But don't leave this room.

15:13.578 --> 15:16.213
I despise this house.

15:18.283 --> 15:19.750
I can't believe this.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.152
I'm drowsy and I'm operating
heavy machinery.

15:22.153 --> 15:23.921
( <i>rock song playing</i> )

16:04.195 --> 16:05.996
Ah. I beat you, Aunt Dorma.

16:05.997 --> 16:06.897
I won.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.367
( laughs )

16:11.903 --> 16:14.004
Oh, the poppies are back.

16:14.005 --> 16:18.075
I stayed up all night
and the poppies are back.

16:18.076 --> 16:19.543
( laughs )

16:19.544 --> 16:23.413
Sabrina? It's me, Valerie.
Are you okay?

16:23.414 --> 16:24.881
Valerie, hi.

16:24.882 --> 16:26.550
Oh, and Libby's here.

16:26.551 --> 16:27.684
I wonder if Libby's ticklish.

16:27.685 --> 16:29.720
Libby, are you ticklish?

16:29.721 --> 16:31.255
( laughs )

16:31.256 --> 16:33.056
Poor thing.
She must be exhausted

16:33.057 --> 16:34.358
from cleaning up all night.

16:34.359 --> 16:36.593
Well, she didn't
do a very good job.

16:36.594 --> 16:38.262
It still smells like mildew.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.130
She can't go to the competition
in this condition.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.133
I can so.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.434
Actually, I can't sew,
but I can knit.

16:44.435 --> 16:45.602
( laughs )

16:45.603 --> 16:47.604
All right,
help me get her into my car.

16:47.605 --> 16:50.941
Maybe she'll perk up
on the ride to school.

16:50.942 --> 16:52.709
Oh, it's freezing out there.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.244
Hey, Libby,
grab her coat, will you?

16:57.415 --> 16:58.682
( <i>dance song playing</i> )

16:59.851 --> 17:01.185
( screams )

17:03.021 --> 17:04.088
Welcome, everyone,

17:04.089 --> 17:08.258
to the 1999 All City
Brainbusters Championships.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.161
Woo!

17:12.364 --> 17:13.563
Are you sure
you can do this?

17:13.564 --> 17:16.300
Positively.
No problemo.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.035
Fire those questions at me,
Willard.

17:18.036 --> 17:20.704
The first round will begin
in just a minute.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.205
( <i>buzzes</i> )
1812!

17:22.207 --> 17:24.007
What is going on over here?

17:24.008 --> 17:25.442
Sorry.
Sabrina's just a little punchy

17:25.443 --> 17:26.643
from staying
up all night.

17:26.644 --> 17:28.779
Rodgers & Hart.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.347
To get to the other side.

17:30.348 --> 17:32.983
Put duct tape over her mouth
if you have to,

17:32.984 --> 17:35.752
but keep her quiet.

17:35.753 --> 17:36.954
All right, Westbridge.

17:36.955 --> 17:39.989
"What is Newton's
third law of motion?"

17:39.990 --> 17:41.057
( buzzes )

17:41.058 --> 17:42.293
I don't know that.

17:44.629 --> 17:45.629
She didn't know that.

17:46.898 --> 17:50.000
Westbridge, "The capital
of Madagascar is--?"

17:50.001 --> 17:51.568
( buzzes )
Snow!

17:51.569 --> 17:53.470
Incorrect.

17:53.471 --> 17:56.139
No, I'm not.
Snow will get rid of poppies.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.608
Why didn't I think of it before?
It's like <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

17:58.609 --> 18:00.510
<i>To wake my aunts</i>
<i>from terrible rot,</i>

18:00.511 --> 18:02.212
<i>send snow to my house,</i>
<i>make sure it's a lot.</i>

18:11.489 --> 18:13.457
The score is Revere, 50,

18:13.458 --> 18:15.826
Westbridge, bupkis.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.361
Next question, Westbridge.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.997
"What is the highest peak
in North America?"

18:22.800 --> 18:24.401
Great. I guess it's up to us

18:24.402 --> 18:26.570
now that Freak Van Winkle's
out cold.

18:26.571 --> 18:27.671
Valerie, you answer.

18:27.672 --> 18:29.572
Me? No way, you answer it.

18:29.573 --> 18:30.840
HARVEY:
No way.

18:30.841 --> 18:32.208
KRAFT:
Westbridge, we are waiting.

18:32.209 --> 18:34.377
What is the highest peak
in North America?

18:37.481 --> 18:38.582
Uh.

18:38.583 --> 18:39.582
( buzzes )

18:39.583 --> 18:40.784
Mount McKinley?

18:40.785 --> 18:42.886
My Lord, that's right.
( cheering )

18:42.887 --> 18:44.621
Ten points for Westbridge.

18:44.622 --> 18:46.223
( both laughing )

18:46.224 --> 18:48.025
( buzzes )

18:48.026 --> 18:49.893
I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

18:49.894 --> 18:52.196
Is it the Pythagorean theorem?

18:52.197 --> 18:54.198
KRAFT:
It is,

18:54.199 --> 18:57.067
and that's ten more points
for Westbridge.

18:57.068 --> 19:00.804
And the moderator is neutral,
of course.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.239
The Pyrenees mountain range

19:02.240 --> 19:05.275
extends from the Bay of Biscay
to the Mediterranean Sea.

19:05.276 --> 19:06.677
It certainly does.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.744
Yes!

19:10.115 --> 19:12.182
All right. This is your
last question, Westbridge.

19:12.183 --> 19:14.118
For the game.

19:16.888 --> 19:22.058
"What country is the largest
producer of soybeans?"

19:22.059 --> 19:23.159
I know it!

19:23.160 --> 19:24.661
( buzzes )
America.

19:24.662 --> 19:26.096
You are correct.

19:26.097 --> 19:27.764
Westbridge wins!
( cheering )

19:30.435 --> 19:31.301
I can't believe it.

19:31.302 --> 19:33.036
Studying actually works.

19:33.037 --> 19:34.504
Sorry about that, Sabrina.

19:34.505 --> 19:36.240
I just couldn't risk it.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.607
What were you going to say?

19:37.608 --> 19:38.742
You got a purty mouth.

19:40.945 --> 19:43.513
No, no. You can come
by my house and see it

19:43.514 --> 19:45.015
any time you want.

19:45.016 --> 19:48.218
Just call first.
I won. I won.

19:48.219 --> 19:51.522
¶ I'm gonna be principal
In 10 or 15 years ¶

19:52.157 --> 19:53.423
( laughs )

19:53.424 --> 19:55.792
Nobody takes a trophy
away from me.

19:55.793 --> 19:57.294
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

20:00.998 --> 20:02.933
Oh, my goodness.
Is she all right?

20:02.934 --> 20:05.035
She's fine, just exhausted.

20:05.036 --> 20:06.370
What a night.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.338
Between helping us study

20:07.339 --> 20:08.739
and the flood
in your living room,

20:08.740 --> 20:11.675
which is now
covered in snow...

20:11.676 --> 20:13.042
I got a toboggan
for my birthday

20:13.043 --> 20:14.978
and I couldn't
wait to try it.

20:14.979 --> 20:16.513
Freak begets freak.

20:16.514 --> 20:17.481
HARVEY:
When she wakes up,

20:17.482 --> 20:19.316
will you tell her we won
the Brainbusters?

20:19.317 --> 20:20.918
Yeah. She convinced us to study.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.352
This trophy
belongs to her.

20:25.423 --> 20:26.490
You know Sabrina.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.759
One crazy idea
after another.

20:30.161 --> 20:31.328
( knocking )

20:31.329 --> 20:34.564
Is there a Zelda Spellman
at this residence?

20:34.565 --> 20:35.866
Yes. May I help you?

20:35.867 --> 20:37.067
You're under arrest for making

20:37.068 --> 20:38.636
threatening phone calls
to your neighbor

20:38.637 --> 20:40.938
and breaking all of his windows
with water balloons.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.006
ZELDA:
But-- B-b-but--

20:43.007 --> 20:45.042
But I've been asleep
for the last 12 hours.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.876
You might want to work
on that alibi.

20:46.877 --> 20:48.878
Somebody's going
to regret this.

20:48.879 --> 20:51.581
I think she was talking to you.

20:56.154 --> 20:57.955
Break time's over, Salem.

20:57.956 --> 21:00.724
Please don't make me
scrub any more toilets.

21:00.725 --> 21:02.693
I keep falling in.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.529
Sabrina,
this is your Aunt Dorma.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.031
You really are a black sheep.

21:08.032 --> 21:09.199
So are you here
for a social visit,

21:09.200 --> 21:10.600
or to poison us in person?

21:10.601 --> 21:13.836
To apologize and to thank you
for waking me up.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.672
I left my oven on,
and if it weren't for you,

21:15.673 --> 21:17.807
my house would have
caught on fire.

21:17.808 --> 21:19.142
And as a way of saying
she's sorry

21:19.143 --> 21:21.177
we're getting a lifetime
supply of mittens.

21:21.178 --> 21:23.046
Oh, and how about a clue
to the family secret?

21:23.047 --> 21:25.682
Certainly. What are barn animal
relatives for?

21:29.220 --> 21:31.855
Birds? It's bad enough trying
to figure out these clues.

21:31.856 --> 21:35.158
Nobody said anything about
having to clean up after them.

21:35.159 --> 21:37.460
Oh, Salem?

21:37.461 --> 21:39.063
( sobbing )

21:40.305 --> 21:46.175
