it was empty.

about the victim.

Was my nephew.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.544
But that would mean...

30:34.040 --> 30:36.679
- That cop that got killed?
- That pissant, Deputy Carl,

30:36.760 --> 30:38.899
he was tailing me. I had no choice.
I had to do it. I had to--

30:39.000 --> 30:41.104
- You killed someone.
- Who had it coming.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.986
But it doesn't matter
now anyways. Baby...

30:43.320 --> 30:44.389
(GASPING)

30:44.800 --> 30:46.665
We need to leave. Now.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.657
- Okay?
- Don't touch me.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.789
Hey!

30:50.960 --> 30:54.066
I'm the one that's giving you
everything that you ever wanted.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.344
So how 'bout you
stop being a bitch, okay?

30:58.960 --> 30:59.949
Athena,

31:00.720 --> 31:01.709
you're with me,

31:02.320 --> 31:05.665
and I will always take care of you
and I will always protect you.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.347
But we need to
get the hell out of Dodge now.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.903
- Just get away from me.
- Baby. Baby!

31:14.680 --> 31:15.669
Damn!

31:32.520 --> 31:34.897
Y'all looking for someone? 'Cause I am.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.199
Bank in town just got robbed.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.339
Turned into a real
OK. Corral type of deal.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.657
Big ol' shoot-out.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.109
Yeah, I heard about that.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.224
Mmm-hmm.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.584
Shawnte, the clerk,
recognized the perp's voice.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.387
She said he sounded just like
that fellow that's been dating Athena.

31:49.000 --> 31:49.989
That so?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.827
And we got prints back from the murder.
They matched prints from the bank.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.507
That boy's been busy.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.177
Already checked his place,
it's cleaned out,

31:57.280 --> 31:59.498
but I figure he ain't goin' nowhere
without his best girl.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.589
So that's why I'm here.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.629
Why are you here?

32:03.240 --> 32:04.229
Same thing.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.469
Trying to get the bad guy.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.459
- Where's your badge?
- I don't need one.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.839
This is family business.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.539
Well, I should tell you
I'm not taking him alive.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.509
Neither am I.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.469
All right, then.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.389
Uh... Aim for the head.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.429
What the hell?

32:39.640 --> 32:40.629
Come on.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.069
All right, you wait here.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.869

34:11.520 --> 34:14.978
Jack, I've killed people
who didn't deserve it...

34:18.640 --> 34:19.629
My friends,

34:20.680 --> 34:21.942
I've killed people I loved.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.548
I wish I could tell you that it...

34:26.480 --> 34:27.469
That it gets easier,

34:29.320 --> 34:32.585
that with time, it hurts less,
but that would be a lie because it...

34:33.080 --> 34:35.947
It never gets easier. And those moments,
they never stop hurting.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.025
But that doesn't mean
that you should stop fighting.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.781
_ Doesn't mean that _
just because you made a mistake...

34:44.280 --> 34:46.225
And that's what this is, Jack.
It's a mistake.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.700
That doesn't mean that you can't...
Can't be better, do better.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.119
And we still believe in you, Jack.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.747
- We-—
- Stop. Just...

dragged me down here,

35:55.920 --> 35:58.263
tossed me around like
I was a damn rag doll.

was gonna happen here?

exactly what went on back there?

Sure.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.221
Guy named Dave killed your deputy.

He tried to kill you,
and you shot him dead.

No, you're not.
