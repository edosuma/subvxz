00:15.399 --> 00:16.632
Ryan, watch!

00:16.634 --> 00:17.899
Looking good, Michelle.

00:42.026 --> 00:44.226
Who are you?

00:54.883 --> 00:56.505
To our newest state senator.

00:56.507 --> 00:58.154
To us.

00:59.176 --> 01:00.409
Watching you up there,

01:00.411 --> 01:02.511
being sworn in by the whole Senate,

01:02.513 --> 01:04.046
I've never felt so proud.

01:05.349 --> 01:06.815
Mom would be, too.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.409
I would think so.

01:08.786 --> 01:10.285
What are you wearing, anyway?

01:10.287 --> 01:11.453
It's a Hmong pattern.

01:11.455 --> 01:13.188
I made it for your swearing in.

01:13.190 --> 01:14.709
Do you like it?

01:17.695 --> 01:19.879
You never teach me about our culture.

01:20.197 --> 01:21.863
What is it?

01:21.865 --> 01:25.365
We move forward by
looking ahead, not what's past.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.537
Where'd you find that?

01:28.539 --> 01:30.240
In a box in your closet.

01:30.541 --> 01:32.307
It was Mom's, wasn't it?

01:33.167 --> 01:35.377
I was saving it for your wedding day.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.658
- Hello.
- Senator.

01:49.660 --> 01:50.990
Ryan!

01:51.795 --> 01:53.395
What's he doing here?

01:53.397 --> 01:54.429
I invited him.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.131
Michelle, this is my day.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.365
There'll be press here.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.168
I get it. He's Hmong-American.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.703
It has nothing to do with that.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.637
He's a nothing.

02:02.639 --> 02:04.139
This punk has no education.

02:04.141 --> 02:05.373
You could do so much better.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.342
Senator, here's your speech.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.344
Get rid of him.

02:10.948 --> 02:14.116
Senator Vang, congratulations.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.253
Michelle.

02:18.255 --> 02:19.975
Get in.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.655
Okay.

02:24.761 --> 02:26.357
Michelle!

02:28.002 --> 02:29.364
Don't do this.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.999
You did this.

02:31.001 --> 02:32.690
Enjoy your big day.

02:44.548 --> 02:45.714
Res me, bro.

02:45.716 --> 02:46.915
Res me.

02:52.723 --> 02:54.856
Michelle, just leave it.

02:56.627 --> 02:57.826
Don't worry about it.

03:13.477 --> 03:15.360
Thank you.

03:15.746 --> 03:17.612
Thank you.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.214
The banquet's about to start.

03:19.216 --> 03:21.216
- Okay.
- You'll need to say a few words,

03:21.218 --> 03:22.584
thank the community for their support.

03:22.586 --> 03:25.253
Done.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.079
Senator?

03:41.438 --> 03:43.205
Is everything all right?

03:48.245 --> 03:50.880
"Say what you did, Senator."

03:51.715 --> 03:53.048
That's all it said.

03:53.050 --> 03:54.282
But you don't have the video?

03:54.284 --> 03:56.451
The police said it was self-erasing.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.520
But they took the senator's
phone to try and recover it.

03:58.522 --> 04:00.622
So, only you saw it?

04:00.624 --> 04:01.823
Yes.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.924
She was eating ice cream.

04:02.926 --> 04:05.126
Her boyfriend was playing video games.

04:05.128 --> 04:07.395
I did not trust that boy
the second I saw him.

04:07.397 --> 04:08.964
What flavor?

04:08.966 --> 04:10.465
Ice cream.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.800
I didn't see the flavor.

04:11.802 --> 04:14.069
I only saw someone point a gun
at my little girl's head.

04:14.071 --> 04:15.971
Well, how did Michelle react, Senator?

04:15.973 --> 04:18.473
Like she didn't know
she was being recorded.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.645
What makes you think your
daughter was kidnapped, sir?

04:23.647 --> 04:25.113
W... That video.

04:25.115 --> 04:26.681
It could be a stupid prank.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.584
Not Michelle...
She always answers my calls.

04:29.586 --> 04:31.453
Well, the police went to
Ryan Cheng's apartment.

04:31.455 --> 04:34.055
Michelle told them that she was fine,

04:34.057 --> 04:37.392
and that it was "Her jerk
of a father interfering."

04:37.394 --> 04:38.994
I don't care what the police say.

04:38.996 --> 04:40.795
They want something.

04:40.797 --> 04:42.364
And I was told you're the best there is,

04:42.366 --> 04:43.965
so let's find out what.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.534
I'm so sorry,
but the Speaker is waiting.

04:49.406 --> 04:50.605
The boy's a Hmong-American.

04:50.607 --> 04:53.141
He knows how important today is
to our community.

04:53.143 --> 04:54.342
Yes, of course.

04:54.344 --> 04:55.377
So, how does this work?

04:55.379 --> 04:57.312
Well, I negotiate, Maxine is my second,

04:57.314 --> 04:59.047
Oliver handles psychological profiling,

04:59.049 --> 05:01.249
Zara is lead investigator.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.251
Senator.

05:02.489 --> 05:03.952
What's there to investigate?

05:04.776 --> 05:06.521
Well, quite a lot, Senator Vang.

05:06.523 --> 05:07.589
At the moment, you don't even have proof

05:07.591 --> 05:09.090
that your daughter's been kidnapped.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.626
Just get her back, Mr. Beaumont.

05:11.628 --> 05:13.704
One more thing.

05:16.099 --> 05:17.265
What did you do?

05:17.267 --> 05:18.300
What?

05:18.302 --> 05:20.802
Well, the message said
"Say what you did."

05:21.230 --> 05:22.737
Well, I have no idea.

05:24.808 --> 05:26.041
Ellen.

05:28.812 --> 05:31.913
Well, there's goes
a textbook case of ASN.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.083
Acquired Situational Narcissism...

05:35.085 --> 05:38.586
It's a personality disorder
brought on by wealth or fame.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.821
Success goes to your head.

05:39.823 --> 05:41.423
You start thinking you're untouchable.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.358
Well, if Michelle was taken
against her will,

05:43.360 --> 05:45.060
we need a motive.

05:45.062 --> 05:47.128
Money's a good place to start.

05:47.130 --> 05:48.964
I'll look into the Hmong angle.

05:48.966 --> 05:49.966
Good.

06:11.897 --> 06:12.996
What do you think?

06:12.998 --> 06:14.665
Is Michelle really in danger,

06:14.667 --> 06:16.800
or is Senator Vang
just an interfering father?

06:16.802 --> 06:18.242
Well, let's ask Michelle.

06:19.038 --> 06:20.804
Problem?

06:20.806 --> 06:23.106
My daughter just busted out of
boarding school.

06:23.108 --> 06:24.408
How do you know that?

06:24.410 --> 06:26.540
A little birdie told me.

06:29.949 --> 06:31.248
My God.
I can't believe he said that.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.382
That's crazy.

06:38.290 --> 06:40.090
Okay, okay, okay... Tonight Melanie's,

06:40.092 --> 06:41.425
then a secret rave maÃ»ana,

06:41.427 --> 06:43.427
followed by dancing at...

06:45.664 --> 06:46.997
It's my dad.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.966
Don't answer it. Don't.

06:50.169 --> 06:51.935
Yeah, come on. Who cares?

07:01.647 --> 07:03.347
Everything all right?

07:03.349 --> 07:04.748
It will be.

07:11.886 --> 07:13.051
Hey.

07:13.053 --> 07:14.786
Um, so my cousin's got

07:14.788 --> 07:16.388
this really sweet crib in the country.

07:16.390 --> 07:19.591
Totally private... with a pool.

07:19.593 --> 07:20.993
I don't know, Ryan.

07:20.995 --> 07:22.294
Come on, Michelle.

07:22.296 --> 07:24.096
His family's away overseas.

07:24.098 --> 07:26.665
We could hang out for a couple of days.

07:28.002 --> 07:29.434
You're upset about your dad.

07:30.278 --> 07:32.437
I hate him sometimes,

07:32.439 --> 07:34.907
but I know he thinks
he's looking out for me.

07:35.358 --> 07:36.875
I'm looking out for you now.

07:38.812 --> 07:40.325
So, will you come?

07:49.536 --> 07:51.102
Here's Ryan Cheng's address.

07:51.127 --> 07:52.659
There they are.

07:54.332 --> 07:56.094
If that's a kidnapping,

07:56.586 --> 07:59.464
she's got an acute case of
Stockholm syndrome.

07:59.964 --> 08:01.166
Let's find out.

08:11.412 --> 08:12.644
Nice ride.

08:12.646 --> 08:15.080
0 to 60 in, what, 4.2?

08:15.082 --> 08:17.082
Quarter mile in 13?

08:17.626 --> 08:19.551
12.6.

08:19.553 --> 08:21.164
12.6.

08:22.122 --> 08:24.189
May I?

08:26.994 --> 08:29.227
That's a fine fried potato.

08:29.229 --> 08:30.762
What do you want, man?

08:30.764 --> 08:32.530
I'm Eric Beaumont.
This is Maxine Carlson.

08:32.533 --> 08:33.698
We're private negotiators.

08:33.701 --> 08:36.201
Your dad thinks
you've been kidnapped, Michelle.

08:36.203 --> 08:39.370
Does it look like I'm kidnapped?

08:39.707 --> 08:41.173
Tell my dad to leave us alone.

08:41.174 --> 08:43.575
Fair enough, but, do us a favor...

08:43.577 --> 08:45.310
No more threatening videos, okay, Ryan?

08:45.312 --> 08:47.813
We already told the police
there was no video.

08:48.887 --> 08:50.282
Burgers?

08:50.284 --> 08:52.250
Really, Michelle,
after all that ice cream?

08:52.252 --> 08:54.519
'Course, that was several hours ago.

08:54.521 --> 08:56.154
How do you know that I had ice cream?

08:56.156 --> 08:58.787
How, indeed, if there was no video?

09:05.626 --> 09:07.366
Who are you calling?

09:07.368 --> 09:08.900
The senator.

09:08.902 --> 09:11.637
He's right.
His daughter has been kidnapped.

09:11.639 --> 09:13.805
She just doesn't realize it yet.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.356
Who are you?

09:37.031 --> 09:38.196
On your feet!

09:38.198 --> 09:39.531
Ryan!!

09:40.901 --> 09:42.734
- Who are you?!
- Shut up.

09:42.736 --> 09:44.603
- Let go, please!
- Shut up!

09:44.605 --> 09:47.105
- Ryan!
- Get in there! Get in!

09:51.078 --> 09:52.944
Ryan!

09:57.351 --> 09:58.517
Help!

09:58.519 --> 10:01.219
Please! Help!

10:01.221 --> 10:03.321
Help!

10:03.323 --> 10:05.157
Help!

10:17.682 --> 10:20.783
If Ryan kidnapped her, he's kind
of hiding in plain sight.

10:20.785 --> 10:21.790
The plan seems to be.

10:21.815 --> 10:23.756
"Make everything appear
as normal as possible,"

10:23.783 --> 10:25.650
throw the cops off the scent.

10:25.652 --> 10:28.019
Clever... A couple of rebellious kids

10:28.021 --> 10:30.088
hiding from an overprotective dad.

10:31.052 --> 10:33.291
A bit too clever for Mr. Neck Tattoo,

10:33.293 --> 10:34.892
don't you think?

10:34.894 --> 10:36.494
So judgmental.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.234
20 bucks says this isn't his show.

10:43.236 --> 10:44.936
He's following orders.

10:54.514 --> 10:55.880
We want to talk to Michelle.

10:55.882 --> 10:57.315
She's not here.

10:57.807 --> 10:59.417
Then where is she?

10:59.419 --> 11:00.752
No idea.

11:00.754 --> 11:02.479
Mind if we take a look around?

11:03.490 --> 11:06.024
Unless you prefer the police again.

11:16.136 --> 11:17.802
You saw her yesterday. She was fine.

11:17.804 --> 11:20.405
Her cellphone was turned off.

11:20.407 --> 11:21.407
So?

11:22.075 --> 11:25.058
So she's a 19-year-old girl.
It's a little unusual.

11:25.412 --> 11:27.278
And you sped off in an awful hurry.

11:27.778 --> 11:29.981
We just want to be left alone.

11:31.923 --> 11:33.317
Chocolate chip.

11:33.319 --> 11:35.219
Video games.

11:35.673 --> 11:37.288
Where's the dude with the gun?

11:38.307 --> 11:42.527
Okay, so, what is it
you want Senator Vang to say?

11:43.652 --> 11:44.896
He knows.

11:45.180 --> 11:47.432
So you did send the message.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.367
All I know is he's a liar,

11:49.369 --> 11:50.802
and she's better off without him.

11:50.804 --> 11:53.104
So, you kidnapped her as a favor?

11:54.541 --> 11:55.706
Keep harassing me, man.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.608
I'll be the one calling the cops.

12:03.383 --> 12:05.550
Definitely someone else's plan.

12:05.552 --> 12:07.885
I doubt he even knows
the full extent of it.

12:07.887 --> 12:09.620
Hey, did you ever find your daughter?

12:09.622 --> 12:10.812
I sure did.

12:11.424 --> 12:12.924
Yeah, baby!

12:12.926 --> 12:15.493
Whoo!

12:19.099 --> 12:20.665
- Drink it. Yeah.
- I want another.

12:24.938 --> 12:26.370
- Get out of here!
- Are you kidding me?

12:26.372 --> 12:28.239
Come on, guys.

12:28.241 --> 12:29.907
Shut it down!

12:29.909 --> 12:31.275
Let's get out of here, people,

12:31.277 --> 12:32.777
before we have to get serious.

12:32.779 --> 12:34.112
- Let's go.
- Come on, are you kidding me?

12:34.114 --> 12:35.947
We're not even bothering anyone.

12:35.949 --> 12:37.815
What kind of jerk called the cops?

12:41.087 --> 12:42.253
You got something?

12:42.255 --> 12:44.255
The Hmong are an indigenousness people

12:44.257 --> 12:46.624
spread across parts of
China, Vietnam, and Laos.

12:46.626 --> 12:49.694
They're like the Native
Americans of southeast Asia

12:49.696 --> 12:51.696
with a comparable history
of persecution.

12:51.698 --> 12:55.099
The ones here in Minnesota
arrived after the Vietnam War.

12:55.101 --> 12:58.035
We have Senator Vang's
financial records.

12:58.037 --> 12:59.837
Investments, donations, tax audits...

12:59.839 --> 13:01.105
I'm still going through them.

13:01.645 --> 13:03.241
Here's what I've got so far.

13:03.243 --> 13:04.909
What is that?

13:04.911 --> 13:08.546
A list of people who have a
grudge against our dear senator.

13:08.548 --> 13:10.948
Popular guy.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.683
Politics is a blood sport.

13:12.685 --> 13:14.118
There's still some names I'm working on.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.920
He fell out with a couple of
property developers,

13:15.922 --> 13:18.356
and I'm trying to track down
his ex-fiance.

13:18.358 --> 13:19.690
What happened there?

13:19.692 --> 13:21.959
Sorry. Above my pay grade.

13:23.062 --> 13:24.495
Thank you.

13:24.497 --> 13:27.198
- Check out the ex-fiance.
- Yeah.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.100
It's gonna take some time to go
through all these.

13:29.102 --> 13:31.017
Time Michelle may not have.

13:31.371 --> 13:32.637
We need them to come to us.

13:32.639 --> 13:34.138
How?

13:34.140 --> 13:35.826
Throw them some shade.

13:55.828 --> 13:57.762
Help!

13:57.764 --> 14:00.042
Help!

14:06.439 --> 14:08.352
Please help me!

14:10.643 --> 14:11.776
Please!

14:11.778 --> 14:13.561
Please help!

14:18.651 --> 14:20.247
Please.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.008
Hi, Ryan.

14:39.672 --> 14:41.572
What are they doing here?

14:42.909 --> 14:45.042
No. No.

14:45.044 --> 14:47.078
This was not the plan, Kaus.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.646
Her father admits what he did.

14:48.648 --> 14:50.615
You don't say what the plan is.

14:50.617 --> 14:51.949
Your part's over.

14:51.951 --> 14:53.517
Stay out of the way.

14:58.224 --> 15:00.191
I can't admit to wrongdoing.

15:00.537 --> 15:02.225
The media will crucify me.

15:02.227 --> 15:05.730
You're not admitting anything.
That's the point.

15:05.732 --> 15:07.898
You're just posting
a blanket apology online

15:07.900 --> 15:10.067
for any wrong that you may have done.

15:10.511 --> 15:12.635
What kind of negotiating tactic is this?

15:12.637 --> 15:14.672
It's called destabilization.

15:14.674 --> 15:17.141
We provoke them, we get them
to react emotionally

15:17.143 --> 15:18.809
by acting like we're giving them
what they want,

15:18.811 --> 15:19.867
when we're not.

15:20.213 --> 15:22.213
It'll force them
to the negotiating table.

15:22.715 --> 15:24.649
There's got to be a better way.

15:24.651 --> 15:26.291
If there was, I'd know about it.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.552
I'm trying to get your daughter
back, Senator.

15:29.582 --> 15:31.749
I assume that's your goal here,

15:31.751 --> 15:34.251
unless I'm missing something.

15:40.059 --> 15:41.833
All right.

15:45.331 --> 15:47.998
Okay. Action.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.510
As I take up my new position
as senator of this great state,

15:52.357 --> 15:55.005
I feel it's important to clear the air

15:55.007 --> 15:57.975
with those in my past
who I have wronged.

15:57.977 --> 16:00.711
If I have offended
or harmed you in any way,

16:01.174 --> 16:05.149
let this statement heal the rift
between us.

16:15.328 --> 16:18.090
This is Olina, my mother.

16:18.092 --> 16:20.097
I'm Nalanie, Ryan's cousin.

16:20.099 --> 16:21.632
What do you want?

16:21.634 --> 16:22.600
Nothing.

16:22.602 --> 16:24.468
We just want you to be happy.

16:26.272 --> 16:29.673
With those in
my past who I have wronged.

16:29.675 --> 16:33.077
If I've offended or hurt you in any way,

16:33.079 --> 16:35.980
let this statement
heal the rift between us.

16:47.994 --> 16:49.159
What do you got?

16:49.161 --> 16:51.662
Hey. I talked to Lormong's ex-fiance.

16:51.664 --> 16:54.898
Happily married, two kids...
Definitely not the kidnapper.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.200
I sense a "But."

16:56.202 --> 16:59.903
It's not her, but what she said
about the senator.

16:59.905 --> 17:01.305
They're together for nine years.

17:01.307 --> 17:03.007
He keeps promising to marry her,

17:03.009 --> 17:05.876
but breaks it off
days before the wedding.

17:05.877 --> 17:08.612
He finally admits it's because
of his deceased wife,

17:08.614 --> 17:12.383
that it would dishonor her somehow.

17:12.385 --> 17:14.550
It took him nine years to work that out?

17:14.946 --> 17:16.520
Exactly.

17:16.521 --> 17:18.222
You'd think a man
hell-bent on getting elected

17:18.223 --> 17:20.223
would see the benefits
of getting married.

17:20.226 --> 17:22.492
Dig into his past, find out
what you can about the wife.

17:22.494 --> 17:24.194
Let's figure out what makes him tick.

17:24.195 --> 17:25.796
I don't buy he doesn't know what he did.

17:28.434 --> 17:30.149
Mr. Beaumont.

17:30.870 --> 17:32.836
- Get in.
- All right.

17:34.173 --> 17:36.206
I'm guessing you saw
the senator's apology.

17:38.344 --> 17:40.678
Ryan.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.282
Don't wait up.

18:14.701 --> 18:16.233
Second thoughts?

18:17.236 --> 18:18.436
Shut up.

18:23.409 --> 18:25.576
You represent the senator?

18:25.578 --> 18:27.611
Eric Beaumont. Negotiator.

18:30.103 --> 18:32.416
Can I get a beer over here?
Do you want a beer?

18:32.418 --> 18:34.793
There's nothing to negotiate.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.055
Was that pathetic video your idea?

18:38.411 --> 18:41.092
Well, it worked. W-We're sitting here.

18:41.094 --> 18:42.760
It was an insult.

18:42.762 --> 18:46.030
'Cause Senator Vang says he has
no idea what this is about.

18:46.179 --> 18:47.798
I was hoping a face-to-face with you

18:47.800 --> 18:49.400
might help me jog his memory.

18:49.597 --> 18:51.435
He knows what he did.

18:51.437 --> 18:52.603
Well, I imagine he does,

18:53.035 --> 18:55.773
but Mr. Kidnapper, you and I both know

18:55.775 --> 18:58.075
he's the kind of man who
spits on you and calls it rain.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.613
Lormong Vang thinks
he can take whatever he wants.

19:02.988 --> 19:04.548
Did he take something from you?

19:04.550 --> 19:06.243
Everything.

19:09.622 --> 19:10.955
He did that to you?

19:10.957 --> 19:12.602
He wouldn't have the guts.

19:13.059 --> 19:14.992
He told the lies that lead to it.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.094
But I survived.

19:17.096 --> 19:19.463
And now I will take everything from him.

19:20.536 --> 19:22.299
But you'll let Michelle go.

19:23.345 --> 19:25.291
He must say what he did

19:25.738 --> 19:27.738
so the whole world knows.

19:29.075 --> 19:30.207
Slight pause.

19:30.209 --> 19:31.709
Rising pitch in your voice.

19:31.711 --> 19:32.743
Pupils dilated.

19:32.745 --> 19:33.978
What are you not telling me?

19:33.980 --> 19:36.313
The longer he takes to remember,

19:36.691 --> 19:38.612
the more he insults me.

19:39.218 --> 19:41.652
We both know who will pay for that.

19:41.654 --> 19:43.687
And we both know an innocent young woman

19:43.689 --> 19:46.223
does not deserve to suffer,
whatever Lormong did.

19:56.702 --> 19:59.437
Michelle's mother was Su Lin Vang,

19:59.439 --> 20:01.539
late wife of Senator Vang.

20:01.541 --> 20:04.308
They were both refugees
fleeing persecution in Laos.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.418
The Hmong sided with the U.S.
during the Vietnam war,

20:06.420 --> 20:09.613
so they weren't exactly popular
when the U.S. pulled out.

20:12.585 --> 20:16.887
She wound up in a refugee camp
in Thailand, 1989,

20:16.889 --> 20:19.757
17, orphan.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.893
There she met Lormong.

20:22.895 --> 20:24.028
They emigrated to the U.S.

20:24.030 --> 20:26.475
and had Michelle two years later.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.200
So, it says here

20:29.202 --> 20:32.269
that Su Lin died in Laos
when Michelle was three.

20:32.271 --> 20:35.507
Why go back to a country
that persecuted you?

20:36.843 --> 20:38.116
What's that?

20:40.079 --> 20:41.479
Consular Report on her death

20:41.481 --> 20:43.714
issued by the U.S. embassy in Laos.

20:43.716 --> 20:47.251
Cause is listed as road accident, but...

20:49.088 --> 20:52.823
there doesn't seem to be
a Laotian death certificate.

20:52.825 --> 20:54.058
Maybe they didn't issue one?

20:54.060 --> 20:55.759
No. The U.S. embassy
would have required it

20:55.761 --> 20:57.595
for the Consular Report.

20:57.597 --> 20:59.196
Do you think it's forged?

21:00.900 --> 21:02.237
I don't know.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.502
I'll call Annie.

21:04.504 --> 21:06.270
Maybe she can hack into
the D.O.D. records

21:06.272 --> 21:07.338
in Laos and find out.

21:07.340 --> 21:08.873
Evie Beaumont.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.073
I'm her father.

21:10.075 --> 21:11.675
Well, can you check again, please?

21:11.677 --> 21:13.143
How'd it go?

21:13.145 --> 21:14.311
He wants revenge,

21:14.313 --> 21:16.080
and Michelle is his way to get it.

21:16.082 --> 21:17.448
He didn't care that I saw his face,

21:17.450 --> 21:18.883
so whatever this is,
it's a one-way trip,

21:18.885 --> 21:20.918
and he's gonna take
the senator down with him.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.553
Yes, Eric Beaumont.

21:22.555 --> 21:24.355
Call me back right away.

21:26.959 --> 21:29.560
Check the button cam for a facial match.

21:37.904 --> 21:39.470
Okay. Got him.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.305
His name is Sawm Cheng...

21:41.307 --> 21:42.473
Hmong-American,

21:42.475 --> 21:45.075
a refugee from Laos like Lormong,

21:45.077 --> 21:46.977
and also Ryan's father.

21:46.979 --> 21:49.480
His name came up when we did
the background check on Ryan,

21:49.482 --> 21:51.649
but there's nothing in the N.C.D...

21:51.651 --> 21:53.717
no criminal offenses whatsoever.

21:53.719 --> 21:55.319
Okay, what is that? Can you bring it up?

21:59.458 --> 22:00.558
Special Guerilla Unit...

22:00.560 --> 22:02.192
When the war spread beyond Vietnam,

22:02.194 --> 22:04.295
the SGU were Hmong recruited by the CIA.

22:04.297 --> 22:06.163
They fought the communists
in neighboring Laos.

22:06.165 --> 22:08.899
This goes way back.

22:08.901 --> 22:10.067
He blames the senator

22:10.069 --> 22:12.329
for getting him sent to prison
and tortured.

22:15.374 --> 22:16.374
What?

22:17.107 --> 22:19.643
He said Lormong took everything.

22:19.645 --> 22:21.779
He was in prison and tortured.

22:22.097 --> 22:23.447
Isn't that everything?

22:23.449 --> 22:25.215
Yeah, maybe.

22:33.626 --> 22:34.626
Let's go.

22:56.582 --> 22:58.449
That feels better, yes?

23:00.319 --> 23:02.040
Isn't it beautiful?

23:02.955 --> 23:05.823
It's a Hmong wedding gown. Very special.

23:07.611 --> 23:09.593
You never see one.

23:18.004 --> 23:19.994
This, too, is Hmong.

23:21.737 --> 23:23.107
Where'd you get it?

23:25.511 --> 23:27.277
It's my mother's.

23:28.105 --> 23:29.986
You respect your history.

23:30.483 --> 23:32.213
This is part of it.

23:37.923 --> 23:38.922
Him?

23:38.924 --> 23:41.225
You fought together in the SGU.

23:41.227 --> 23:44.361
I can't believe...
After all these years...

23:44.363 --> 23:45.462
You accused him of something

23:45.464 --> 23:47.431
that got him imprisoned and tortured.

23:47.433 --> 23:49.133
I have no memories of that.

23:49.135 --> 23:50.601
I hardly knew him.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.436
I'm a decorated soldier.

23:52.438 --> 23:53.804
Men like him envy me.

23:54.574 --> 23:56.040
You really can't remember?

23:56.042 --> 23:57.808
He invented some grudge against me.

23:57.810 --> 23:59.166
Is that my fault?

23:59.612 --> 24:02.046
Look, I hired you to deal with this.

24:02.048 --> 24:03.614
Do it.

24:07.186 --> 24:09.620
A feature of narcissistic
personality disorder

24:09.622 --> 24:12.122
is a tendency to form false memories.

24:12.124 --> 24:14.558
They get edited to
remain consistent with

24:14.560 --> 24:17.461
a... a positive sense of self.

24:17.463 --> 24:19.430
You're saying he truly doesn't
remember what he did?

24:19.432 --> 24:21.531
Annie just e-mailed
a Laotian death certificate

24:21.533 --> 24:22.818
for Michelle's mother.

24:22.820 --> 24:26.170
But what's weird is there's no
record of her returning to Laos.

24:26.410 --> 24:27.838
She would have needed a visa.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.139
So, how did she die in Laos

24:29.141 --> 24:31.275
when she never left the United States?

24:36.615 --> 24:38.315
See? Beautiful.

24:38.317 --> 24:39.888
My God.

24:40.486 --> 24:42.886
You look just like her.

24:43.544 --> 24:45.489
My name is Sawm.

24:45.491 --> 24:47.424
I knew your mother.

24:47.899 --> 24:50.427
These are from her to me.

24:50.429 --> 24:52.730
They'll help you understand.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.165
My mother?

24:55.167 --> 24:56.928
I loved her very much.

24:58.416 --> 25:00.223
Read them.

25:04.243 --> 25:07.816
Senator Vang, how did you
meet Michelle's mother?

25:08.748 --> 25:09.980
What do you mean?

25:10.936 --> 25:13.584
Well, at a party,
bump into her on the street?

25:14.264 --> 25:17.504
We met at a refugee camp
long after the war was over.

25:17.990 --> 25:19.857
She was young, alone,

25:19.859 --> 25:21.992
and she begged for my protection.

25:22.446 --> 25:23.761
How did she die?

25:23.763 --> 25:26.063
Visiting relatives in Laos
in a car accident.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.197
Why does this matter?

25:27.199 --> 25:29.500
Well, it matters because
you're lying, Senator.

25:33.305 --> 25:34.919
Your wife didn't die in Laos.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.242
What really happened to her?

25:38.576 --> 25:41.211
I don't think this is getting
anywhere, Mr. Beaumont.

25:41.213 --> 25:44.153
You're turning this into
a wild goose chase.

25:45.518 --> 25:47.251
This has nothing to do with
Michelle's mother.

25:47.253 --> 25:49.153
I loved her deeply.

25:49.155 --> 25:51.388
I'll ask the police
to take over from here.

25:51.390 --> 25:52.790
Well, that's your prerogative,

25:52.792 --> 25:54.458
but, Senator, whatever Sawm's plan is,

25:54.460 --> 25:57.194
it does not include
returning Michelle to you.

26:00.266 --> 26:04.134
Sawm has been biding his time,
nursing his hatred.

26:04.136 --> 26:05.669
He waited until
you were a public figure,

26:05.671 --> 26:06.870
when you had the most to lose.

26:06.872 --> 26:09.273
It may be that neither I nor the police

26:09.275 --> 26:10.910
can get Michelle back.

26:11.610 --> 26:15.456
The one thing that might
is your complete honestly.

26:16.448 --> 26:17.447
Mr. Beaumont.

26:17.449 --> 26:18.382
Yeah?

26:18.384 --> 26:20.450
There's someone here to see you.

26:26.258 --> 26:27.658
Hi, Dad.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.726
Is this a bad time?

26:31.897 --> 26:33.530
She seems fine.

26:33.532 --> 26:35.065
I'll call you back.

26:35.067 --> 26:37.868
Did you really have to tell Mom?

26:37.870 --> 26:39.837
She's worried sick.

26:39.839 --> 26:41.371
You disappear and then you show up here.

26:41.373 --> 26:42.973
What's going on, Evie?

26:42.975 --> 26:44.408
Maybe I just missed you.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.577
You could have called.

26:46.579 --> 26:48.278
Where is your phone, by the way?

26:48.280 --> 26:50.681
You tell me. You're the one tracking it.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.717
I see. So, you're making a point.

26:53.719 --> 26:55.686
You just figured that out?

26:55.688 --> 26:56.820
Dad's off his game.

26:57.287 --> 26:58.322
This is unbelievable.

26:58.324 --> 27:00.224
That credit card is for emergencies.

27:00.226 --> 27:01.892
What airline let you talk your way on?

27:01.894 --> 27:03.527
Who even told you I was here?

27:04.654 --> 27:06.864
Kevin is so fired. He is so fired.

27:06.866 --> 27:09.666
Or you could try treating me
like an autonomous human being

27:09.668 --> 27:11.235
and not some remote-controlled toy.

27:11.237 --> 27:12.603
You want to be treated like an adult?

27:12.605 --> 27:13.837
Try behaving like one.

27:16.075 --> 27:17.474
Okay.

27:17.476 --> 27:21.435
So, you see here...
When you say "Honesty"...

27:22.481 --> 27:25.649
That's a micro expression,
textbook emotional leakage.

27:25.651 --> 27:27.284
So, he's lying?

27:27.286 --> 27:30.087
I don't think so.
Not consciously, anyway.

27:30.089 --> 27:32.623
It's more like cognitive dissonance.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.659
He's struggling with
competing ideas o... of himself.

27:35.661 --> 27:38.328
"I'm a great man. I did a bad thing."

27:39.598 --> 27:41.398
Bring up his financials again.

27:41.710 --> 27:43.767
I noticed his charitable donations.

27:43.769 --> 27:44.935
Yeah? What about them?

27:44.937 --> 27:46.570
Well, they're all under a few thousand,

27:46.572 --> 27:48.038
and then there's this one.

27:49.275 --> 27:52.876
Center for Abused & Abducted Women...

27:52.878 --> 27:57.748
10 annual donations, $40,000 each.

27:57.750 --> 28:00.550
A man believes he's great
but does something terrible.

28:00.552 --> 28:02.486
He's easing his conscience.

28:02.488 --> 28:06.123
Okay, so there are 14 domestic
violence shelters in the state.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.492
What's making him donate to this one?

28:08.494 --> 28:09.793
Well, let's find out.

28:09.795 --> 28:10.894
Yeah.

28:10.896 --> 28:13.439
Zara, talk to Ryan.

28:17.636 --> 28:18.869
Txiv.

28:20.005 --> 28:21.471
I care for her.

28:21.473 --> 28:22.673
Let me marry her.

28:22.675 --> 28:23.874
She's going far away,

28:23.876 --> 28:26.109
where you will never find her.

28:27.513 --> 28:29.579
Where are you taking her?

28:29.581 --> 28:31.014
She's innocent.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.887
Txiv!

28:46.769 --> 28:49.036
I'm Angela Marten. I run the shelter.

28:49.038 --> 28:50.537
Very peaceful here.

28:50.539 --> 28:53.240
Our clients come from
very challenging backgrounds.

28:53.242 --> 28:55.709
Environments like this
can really aid recovery.

28:55.711 --> 28:58.145
Well, thank you again for
seeing us on such short notice.

28:58.578 --> 28:59.780
How can I help?

28:59.782 --> 29:02.015
Have you ever encountered
women abducted from home

29:02.017 --> 29:04.519
and coerced into marrying a man
against their will?

29:05.326 --> 29:06.480
It's very rare now.

29:06.482 --> 29:09.850
Thankfully, most cultures have
left that practice behind.

29:09.852 --> 29:11.049
But not yours?

29:11.421 --> 29:13.654
It hasn't been part of
the Hmong community

29:13.656 --> 29:15.523
for a very long time, Mr. Beaumont.

29:15.525 --> 29:17.291
Why do you ask?

29:17.293 --> 29:19.694
Well, we're looking for
a missing young woman.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.163
And you think this has happened to her?

29:22.337 --> 29:24.432
Could you explain the process?

29:25.328 --> 29:28.336
Forced marriage is,
um, often accompanied by

29:28.338 --> 29:31.906
abuse and manipulation... brainwashing.

29:31.908 --> 29:34.342
It's simple and brutally effective.

29:34.344 --> 29:36.844
They first isolate a young woman,

29:36.846 --> 29:39.680
use fear and violence often.

29:40.850 --> 29:43.651
Then they bring in women
who groom and feed her

29:43.653 --> 29:48.856
and present her the prospect of
a more comfortable, safe life,

29:49.336 --> 29:51.879
show her pictures of her future husband.

29:52.462 --> 29:54.695
It's the carrot and stick.

29:54.697 --> 29:57.732
And if they can, they try
to convince her that her home,

29:57.734 --> 29:59.600
her family, everything that she's known

29:59.602 --> 30:01.535
is somehow compromised,

30:01.537 --> 30:03.104
that she has no choice

30:03.106 --> 30:06.479
except to embrace the life
that she's being forced into.

30:06.943 --> 30:08.743
And how long could this process take?

30:08.745 --> 30:11.145
It can be as fast as three days.

30:11.147 --> 30:13.120
Is that what happened to you?

30:17.019 --> 30:18.953
We're working for Lormong Vang.

30:18.955 --> 30:22.590
Su Lin, a man named Sawm Cheng
has taken your daughter.

30:23.493 --> 30:25.059
I think he's planning to do to her

30:25.061 --> 30:27.128
what Lormong Vang did to you.

30:28.197 --> 30:30.998
I understand why you left.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.032
You couldn't live your life

30:32.034 --> 30:33.634
with a man who forced you to marry him,

30:33.636 --> 30:35.002
but I know there's not a moment

30:35.004 --> 30:37.371
where you're not thinking
about Michelle.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.960
She thinks you're dead.

30:42.095 --> 30:44.016
She thinks she's all alone in the world.

30:46.849 --> 30:49.250
You have me mistaken for someone else.

30:54.791 --> 30:56.791
How did you know
Angela was Michelle's mother?

30:56.793 --> 30:58.859
Why else would he make payments
to this shelter?

30:58.861 --> 31:01.796
He's assuaging his guilt,
buying her silence.

31:01.798 --> 31:04.899
And he never remarried
because he still is married.

31:04.901 --> 31:06.901
So, Michelle's mother
was in love with Sawm,

31:06.903 --> 31:08.202
but Lormong bridenapped her.

31:08.204 --> 31:10.104
Now Sawm is bridenapping Michelle

31:10.106 --> 31:11.806
to make Lormong suffer like he has.

31:11.808 --> 31:13.040
It's eye for an eye.

31:13.042 --> 31:15.109
Michelle's mother could be
a real help to us right now.

31:15.111 --> 31:18.479
Whatever Lormong did to her,
those scars haven't healed.

31:18.481 --> 31:20.047
She's afraid of him,

31:20.049 --> 31:22.016
afraid of what he'll do
if she doesn't keep his secrets.

31:22.018 --> 31:23.551
You know, she said
it could take three days

31:23.553 --> 31:25.512
to brainwash a girl like Michelle.

31:25.888 --> 31:27.170
Day three is almost over.

31:27.172 --> 31:28.189
Right.

31:40.736 --> 31:42.436
Evie.

31:46.042 --> 31:49.376
So, why did you go AWOL from school?

31:50.225 --> 31:52.279
I went to a party.

31:52.281 --> 31:53.747
You were young once, right?

31:53.749 --> 31:56.213
Nah, those were just rumors.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.454
You know,
your dad really cares about you.

32:00.456 --> 32:02.523
But he feels guilty
that he's always away,

32:02.525 --> 32:04.191
so he deals with it by over-compensating

32:04.193 --> 32:05.791
and interfering in my life.

32:06.162 --> 32:08.062
Did you get that at therapy?

32:08.064 --> 32:09.897
I'm not in therapy.

32:09.899 --> 32:12.733
Every day he makes sacrifices
to save other people.

32:12.735 --> 32:14.286
So I hear.

32:17.773 --> 32:19.073
Okay. Come with me.

32:20.643 --> 32:22.343
But I thought we were supposed to...

32:23.613 --> 32:25.212
Maxine!

32:45.001 --> 32:46.467
What are you doing?

32:46.469 --> 32:47.635
You're drugging her?

32:47.637 --> 32:49.203
She needed rest before the flight.

32:49.205 --> 32:50.237
Flight?

32:50.239 --> 32:52.072
To Laos, to get married.

32:52.074 --> 32:53.173
You need to leave.

32:54.243 --> 32:55.743
Michelle!

32:55.745 --> 32:58.846
Baby, this is our chance, okay?
We need to go right now.

33:00.082 --> 33:01.162
No.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.451
You lied to me.

33:04.752 --> 33:06.987
I didn't know that they were
gonna take you away.

33:06.989 --> 33:08.322
I read the letters.

33:08.324 --> 33:09.590
Everything my father said

33:09.592 --> 33:12.893
about how happy my mother was was a lie.

33:13.498 --> 33:15.195
She never loved him.

33:15.197 --> 33:16.564
She loves your father,

33:16.566 --> 33:18.465
and mine took her away from him.

33:18.467 --> 33:19.867
But now mine's taking you.

33:19.869 --> 33:21.335
He's doing this for revenge.

33:22.438 --> 33:24.838
I told you to stay out of this!

33:24.840 --> 33:25.906
Stop!

33:30.713 --> 33:31.745
Stop!

33:31.747 --> 33:33.380
Stop it!

33:33.382 --> 33:37.551
Ryan, I want to go.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.654
There's nothing left for me here.

33:40.656 --> 33:45.025
If you really care for me, let me.

33:45.027 --> 33:47.027
No. Michelle...

34:01.711 --> 34:03.077
Thanks for coming.

34:03.079 --> 34:05.145
I know what my dad does, Maxine.

34:05.147 --> 34:07.114
I don't need to be
at some boring speech.

34:07.116 --> 34:09.516
This one you do.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.755
Ryan?

34:20.963 --> 34:22.281
We just...

34:24.233 --> 34:26.103
We want to help Michelle.

34:30.239 --> 34:31.739
I can help.

34:31.741 --> 34:33.974
Just tell me where she is.

34:45.621 --> 34:47.121
O-Okay... I know what you're gonna say,

34:47.123 --> 34:49.556
but she needs to see this.

34:49.558 --> 34:51.391
Mr. Beaumont, I thought I told you...

34:51.393 --> 34:52.860
The police are handling this now.

34:52.862 --> 34:54.594
We spoke to Ryan Cheng.

34:54.597 --> 34:56.797
They're putting Michelle
on a flight to Laos tonight.

34:57.451 --> 34:59.066
The police will stop them.

34:59.068 --> 35:01.001
Michelle's legally an adult.

35:01.003 --> 35:02.336
I believe she's going willingly

35:02.338 --> 35:04.004
to marry a man she's never met.

35:04.006 --> 35:06.740
Sawm's broken her spirit.

35:06.742 --> 35:09.012
And there's only one thing
you can do to stop her.

35:09.885 --> 35:12.112
Say what you did.

35:15.384 --> 35:18.619
Senator, this is not about you
or Sawm or your career.

35:18.621 --> 35:20.821
It's not even about Michelle's mother.

35:21.268 --> 35:23.791
This is about Michelle.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.445
I saw her at a dance.

35:32.868 --> 35:34.622
She was breathtaking.

35:35.204 --> 35:37.006
But she was Sawm's,

35:37.907 --> 35:39.146
and I took her.

35:40.278 --> 35:44.745
Even after Michelle, she was so unhappy.

35:44.747 --> 35:46.567
She wanted to die.

35:46.949 --> 35:49.030
And she never loved me.

35:49.652 --> 35:52.501
But I wouldn't let her take my daughter.

35:53.222 --> 35:54.688
So the best thing for Michelle

35:54.690 --> 35:57.223
was to think her mother was dead.

35:59.695 --> 36:03.297
Everything I did, I... I did for them.

36:04.255 --> 36:08.569
Senator, it's time for you speech.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.608
Please bring her home, Mr. Beaumont.

36:20.405 --> 36:24.485
He might have told us,
but will he tell Sawm?

36:28.691 --> 36:30.997
It's not Sawm who needs to hear it.

36:32.155 --> 36:34.328
So, if you can just
do that for me, okay?

36:34.330 --> 36:35.330
Okay.

36:42.304 --> 36:44.471
I saw her at a dance.

36:44.473 --> 36:46.740
She was breathtaking.

37:20.342 --> 37:22.075
Get out.

37:28.784 --> 37:31.426
Michelle's leaving for a fresh start.

37:32.493 --> 37:35.589
Tell him. You want this.

37:35.591 --> 37:37.057
Michelle, I know they've convinced you

37:37.059 --> 37:38.425
there's nothing here for you.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.294
I want to go.

37:41.564 --> 37:43.997
You think you know the truth,
Mr. Cheng, but you don't.

37:43.999 --> 37:46.306
He stole the woman I loved...

37:46.836 --> 37:49.279
broke her heart so much she died.

37:49.839 --> 37:51.205
But she didn't.

38:01.684 --> 38:03.584
Su Lin?

38:06.776 --> 38:08.361
My baby.

38:09.225 --> 38:10.757
Mother?

38:26.675 --> 38:29.209
This is what he does every day?

38:29.211 --> 38:31.211
Pretty much.

38:39.688 --> 38:41.268
But she was Sawm's.

38:42.191 --> 38:43.423
And I took her.

38:43.425 --> 38:45.792
I thought she'd settle
in the United States

38:45.794 --> 38:47.394
after we had our child.

38:48.062 --> 38:50.163
Michelle's father said what he did.

38:50.886 --> 38:52.703
That's all you're gonna get.

39:04.722 --> 39:06.413
Yes?

39:06.415 --> 39:09.349
Senator Vang? We have her.

39:12.855 --> 39:16.456
The hardest decision of my life
was leaving you,

39:16.458 --> 39:19.192
but I couldn't be with him,

39:20.026 --> 39:22.585
and I had nothing when I left.

39:25.134 --> 39:29.121
He had so much... could give you
things I never could.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.601
I watched you.

39:33.175 --> 39:35.008
You were happy.

39:35.010 --> 39:37.770
I thought I would ruin it
if I came back.

39:43.519 --> 39:45.285
This is yours.

39:47.013 --> 39:48.855
It's part of a set.

39:48.857 --> 39:51.001
You know what the symbol means?

39:52.411 --> 39:57.297
The coil represents
the union of two parts...

39:57.299 --> 40:00.566
a mother, a daughter,

40:01.103 --> 40:04.204
connected, growing together.

40:14.249 --> 40:16.450
Senator Vang notified the police.

40:16.452 --> 40:18.885
Sawm and Kaus
have been taken into custody.

40:18.887 --> 40:20.053
Ryan, too.

40:20.823 --> 40:23.303
The son pays for the sins of the father.

40:24.927 --> 40:26.586

40:30.766 --> 40:32.799

40:44.513 --> 40:47.520

"Take your kid to work" day.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.350

41:04.066 --> 41:05.814
Three!
