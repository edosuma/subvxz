00:00.399 --> 00:01.366
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

00:01.393 --> 00:04.861
I'll send you on an epic quest.

00:04.919 --> 00:06.588
The Tale of the Seven Keys.

00:06.621 --> 00:10.225
My father's dying,
and I need you to fix him.

00:10.259 --> 00:13.462
I require someone I trust
to accompany you.

00:13.495 --> 00:15.330
I'd like you
to meet your daughter.

00:15.364 --> 00:16.531
What?

00:16.565 --> 00:18.400
Just say it.
Cancer.

00:18.433 --> 00:19.734
Call it cancer plus.

00:19.768 --> 00:21.002
How long till I die?

00:21.035 --> 00:22.871
No, you're not going to, okay?

00:25.006 --> 00:26.575
Holy shit.

00:26.608 --> 00:28.477
As a niff in, you made enemies.

00:28.510 --> 00:31.480
I am here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

00:31.513 --> 00:33.482
- Who?
- The lamprey.

00:33.515 --> 00:35.617
What do you want
with the lamprey anyway?

00:35.650 --> 00:37.619
It's more what
the lamprey wants with me.

00:37.652 --> 00:39.020
Well, if you could do magic...

00:39.053 --> 00:40.622
Yeah, well, I can't.

00:40.655 --> 00:42.457
You're down to an
early warning device...

00:42.491 --> 00:43.925
an alarm, if you will.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.793 --> 01:19.894
Sorry about this.

01:21.095 --> 01:23.798
I need your help.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.069
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

01:28.102 --> 01:31.340
So, I'm not dead anymore.

01:34.343 --> 01:35.810
Alice?

01:35.844 --> 01:38.079
Shit.

01:38.112 --> 01:41.416
Hi, Mom.

01:41.450 --> 01:43.618
So, I'm alive.

01:43.652 --> 01:44.686
Oh, I know.

01:44.719 --> 01:47.088
Quentin called us
after it happened,

01:47.121 --> 01:49.624
and you're just
visiting us now.

01:52.961 --> 01:56.097
I've been meaning to come by...

01:56.130 --> 01:57.832
Excuse the mess.

01:57.866 --> 02:00.969
All our architectural
enchantments collapsed

02:01.002 --> 02:02.604
when magic vanished.

02:02.637 --> 02:06.475
But then, you'd know that
if you ever called.

02:09.043 --> 02:10.479
Who's she?

02:10.512 --> 02:11.780
That's Carol.

02:11.813 --> 02:13.448
That's Carol?

02:13.482 --> 02:15.584
Well, maybe you didn't
realize that she used

02:15.617 --> 02:18.853
a lot of illusion work
to keep herself looking thin.

02:18.887 --> 02:20.889
So, now she drinks.

02:20.922 --> 02:22.391
Carol?

02:22.424 --> 02:24.359
You remember my daughter,
Alice?

02:24.393 --> 02:25.794
She used to be dead.

02:25.827 --> 02:27.596
Now she isn't.

02:27.629 --> 02:30.565
And it's only just now that
she's decided to visit us.

02:30.599 --> 02:32.133
And she brought a cat.

02:39.173 --> 02:42.611
That priest held a whole
island hostage with this key.

02:42.644 --> 02:45.814
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get it to do anything.

02:45.847 --> 02:48.383
Kinda creeps me out every time
I pick it up, though.

02:48.417 --> 02:49.818
We need a rabbit.

02:49.851 --> 02:51.520
I need to send a message
to King Quentin ASAP.

02:51.553 --> 02:52.887
How close is
the nearest island?

02:52.921 --> 02:54.623
Beyond Fillory's
territorial waters,

02:54.656 --> 02:56.958
the islands
don't like to be mapped,

02:56.991 --> 02:59.160
so sometimes they move.

02:59.193 --> 03:00.895
I'm reasonably certain
that the nearest one

03:00.929 --> 03:03.632
is somewhere in this
general area, Your Majesty.

03:03.665 --> 03:06.034
All hands are on deck!

03:16.645 --> 03:19.548
What's going on, Admiral?

03:19.581 --> 03:22.083
Trouble on the horizon, sire.

03:22.116 --> 03:25.086
Pirates.

03:25.119 --> 03:27.789
They're flying the red bones,
Your Majesty.

03:27.822 --> 03:30.625
No quarter given.

03:31.593 --> 03:33.928
Well, shit.

03:34.763 --> 03:37.432
Hey, Q.
Did you find Kady?

03:37.466 --> 03:38.967
No, I struck out.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.569
Yeah, so did Josh.

03:40.602 --> 03:42.737
I'm at the cottage
checking bedrooms now.

03:43.938 --> 03:45.507
Do you wanna meet me here,
or...?

03:45.540 --> 03:46.841
No, I-I can't.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.477
I have to leave town.
My dad got worse.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.111
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

03:50.144 --> 03:52.080
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

03:52.113 --> 03:53.214
Will do.

03:53.247 --> 03:54.849
I should go.

04:04.493 --> 04:06.528
Hi.

04:06.561 --> 04:08.062
Can I come in?

04:08.096 --> 04:09.197
Please?

04:09.230 --> 04:11.733
Give me another chance.

04:14.068 --> 04:16.471
Oh, my God.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.572
He looks terrible.

04:18.607 --> 04:22.677
And getting worse.

04:22.711 --> 04:24.245
I have a ritual
that could save him

04:24.278 --> 04:25.947
but it requires a lot of magic,

04:25.980 --> 04:27.582
so, you can participate,

04:27.616 --> 04:30.552
or you can fuck off.
Dealer's choice.

04:30.585 --> 04:33.021
What's the ritual?

04:33.054 --> 04:35.590
We're gonna summon a demon.

05:02.551 --> 05:03.918
II don't understand.

05:03.952 --> 05:05.620
What are the pirates
trying to do?

05:05.654 --> 05:06.821
Kill us and take our ship.

05:06.855 --> 05:09.157
Are they allowed to do that?

05:09.190 --> 05:10.892
I thought father was the king.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.160
He is.

05:12.193 --> 05:14.195
That's why they want
He's rich.

05:14.228 --> 05:16.064
You should lock yourself and
your family in the royal cabin.

05:16.097 --> 05:18.700
Please, Your Majesty,
come with me.

05:23.672 --> 05:26.708
What an odd way
to make a living, pirating.

05:26.741 --> 05:27.909
We can make our stand here.

05:27.942 --> 05:29.310
Fray, get behind me.

05:29.343 --> 05:31.312
I won't let them harm you
and neither will your father.

05:31.345 --> 05:33.648
Please, Lady Fen,
if we fight, they'll kill us.

05:33.682 --> 05:35.750
Plus, are we super totally sure

05:35.784 --> 05:37.085
that talking to them
won't work?

05:37.118 --> 05:38.753
No, pirates take.
That's what they do.

05:38.787 --> 05:40.288
Will you not fight, Father?

05:40.321 --> 05:42.090
Your father is
a powerful magician,

05:42.123 --> 05:43.592
but when magic disappeared...

05:43.625 --> 05:45.026
Is father a coward, then?

05:45.059 --> 05:47.629
Father's a survivor.

05:47.662 --> 05:49.631
That's weird.

05:49.664 --> 05:52.300
Was there always
a keyhole right there?

05:54.302 --> 05:56.838
Wait a second.

06:21.129 --> 06:23.865
Mom,
can we talk privately, please?

06:23.898 --> 06:27.235
Well, I certainly don't have
anything to hide from Carol.

06:27.268 --> 06:28.703
We were just discussing how

06:28.737 --> 06:31.205
magic is due to come back
any time now.

06:31.239 --> 06:33.041
What a cute little kitten.

06:34.142 --> 06:35.243
Oh.

06:36.745 --> 06:39.714
- Back off, Carol!
- Alice, really?

06:39.748 --> 06:41.616
Just stay away from her.

06:41.650 --> 06:42.951
Don't be ridiculous.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.786
Now, Carol is in
a very fragile state...

06:44.819 --> 06:46.287
You need to listen
to me right now.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.656
No, no, no, no.

06:47.689 --> 06:49.090
You listen to me.

06:49.123 --> 06:50.892
Now, you can't just come
traipsing back in here

06:50.925 --> 06:54.228
without any regard
for people's feelings.

06:54.262 --> 06:55.630
Fine.

06:55.664 --> 06:57.331
Where's Dad, then?

06:57.365 --> 06:59.000
Look, all I'm saying is,

06:59.033 --> 07:01.235
how well do you know this
person who gave you the ritual?

07:01.269 --> 07:03.638
Look,
I'd love to be more cautious,

07:03.672 --> 07:05.006
but Penny is gonna die.

07:05.039 --> 07:08.009
So, if you have
a better idea right now,

07:08.042 --> 07:09.678
I'm all ears.

07:14.348 --> 07:16.751
Okay.

07:16.785 --> 07:19.721
What do you need me to do?

07:19.754 --> 07:21.723
I need a goat femur,
pencil shavings,

07:21.756 --> 07:24.058
and some other stuff
for the summoning.

07:26.795 --> 07:28.963
Alice.

07:28.997 --> 07:32.366
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.868
When we heard,
I knew that you would

07:33.902 --> 07:35.336
take the time that you need,
but...

07:35.369 --> 07:36.971
Dad, we have to hurry.

07:37.005 --> 07:39.107
There's a lamprey after me.

07:39.140 --> 07:42.210
A lamprey?

07:42.243 --> 07:43.712
What did you do to it?

07:43.745 --> 07:45.179
It's not important, it...

07:45.213 --> 07:47.782
but it's after me
and anyone connected to me,

07:47.816 --> 07:50.785
and, look, I think
it's inside Carol right now.

07:50.819 --> 07:52.320
But... Carol
is with your mother.

07:52.353 --> 07:54.388
And I tried to warn her,
but you know Mom.

07:54.422 --> 07:56.057
If I had any magic at all,

07:56.090 --> 07:58.192
I'd be able to fight it,
but I don't.

07:58.226 --> 08:00.261
So, I need your help.

08:00.294 --> 08:01.863
Now.

08:01.896 --> 08:03.331
Seriously, Tick?

08:03.364 --> 08:04.933
What is the problem here?

08:04.966 --> 08:09.003
I asked for two simple things.

08:09.037 --> 08:13.074
Pull up the fields,
plant some goddamn mushrooms.

08:13.107 --> 08:15.944
If you will allow me
to mansplain, Your Highness,

08:15.977 --> 08:18.713
the farmers are hesitant
because you're asking them

08:18.747 --> 08:21.349
to throw out food
and replace it with, uh...

08:21.382 --> 08:23.818
Inedible mushrooms, I got it.

08:23.852 --> 08:26.354
And mansplaining

08:26.387 --> 08:28.389
is a bad thing, Tick.

08:28.422 --> 08:31.726
But I'm a man... explaining.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.160
Is that not mansplaining?

08:33.193 --> 08:35.063
Perhaps you could
woman-splain it to me.

08:35.096 --> 08:38.432
It's not me.
It's the fucking fairies.

08:38.466 --> 08:40.268
This is more of their bullshit.

08:40.301 --> 08:42.503
Earthworms, squirrel tongues,

08:42.535 --> 08:44.906
and now mushroom fields.

08:44.939 --> 08:47.909
I just need it done.
Okay?

08:47.942 --> 08:50.812
The queen will not be pleased.

08:50.845 --> 08:54.749
Are the fairies here right now?

08:54.783 --> 08:56.851
They were.

08:56.885 --> 08:58.319
Now they've gone
to tell the queen

08:58.352 --> 09:00.454
that we screwed the pooch
right in the pooper.

09:00.488 --> 09:01.790
That sounds painful.

09:01.823 --> 09:02.791
It is.

09:02.824 --> 09:04.358
Your Highness!

09:04.392 --> 09:06.861
We just a received
a report from the seagulls

09:06.895 --> 09:09.097
that the Muntjac has
been captured by pirates.

09:09.130 --> 09:10.865
Two days' sail
from After Island.

09:10.899 --> 09:14.135
Son of a twat.

09:14.168 --> 09:17.872
Tick, what is the fastest
boat in our Navy?

09:17.906 --> 09:19.173
The Morgan Downs, ma'am,

09:19.207 --> 09:21.175
could reach
the Muntjac in a week.

09:21.209 --> 09:24.012
Without magical assistance,
that's the best we can muster.

09:24.045 --> 09:28.983
No, it is not
the best we can muster.

09:29.818 --> 09:31.820
Follow me, dickholes.

09:44.098 --> 09:44.432
Queen Margo.

09:46.467 --> 09:49.170
Perhaps you can tell me
what's taking so long

09:49.203 --> 09:51.439
to plant the mushroom fields.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.309
Mushroom screw-ups are
on these chuckleheads.

09:55.343 --> 09:57.979
Meanwhile,
I have a real problem.

09:58.012 --> 10:02.216
The High King was hijacked by
pirates and I can't help him.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.517
But you can.

10:03.551 --> 10:05.419
I don't see why
that's my problem.

10:05.453 --> 10:07.889
You wanna run this kingdom
behind the scenes, fine.

10:07.922 --> 10:10.191
But what happens when
every jackoff out there

10:10.224 --> 10:13.061
gets the idea that Fillory is
easy pickings with magic gone

10:13.094 --> 10:15.063
'cause we can't even
defend our High King?

10:15.096 --> 10:17.465
You think you can't get
mushroom fields planted now,

10:17.498 --> 10:20.468
see what happens then.

10:20.501 --> 10:23.104
Interesting argument.

10:23.137 --> 10:24.572
I'll tell you what.

10:24.605 --> 10:28.609
I can bring you there
via Pegasus,

10:28.642 --> 10:32.580
but you negotiate with
the privateers on your own.

10:32.613 --> 10:34.048
When do we leave?

10:36.384 --> 10:38.552
These two need to come with.

10:48.096 --> 10:49.263
Oh, my God...

10:49.297 --> 10:50.899
Alice!

10:50.932 --> 10:52.000
Daniel.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.401
What are you doing?

10:53.434 --> 10:55.169
Mom, I don't expect
you to understand,

10:55.203 --> 10:57.038
but Carol has a lamprey
inside of her

10:57.071 --> 10:58.639
and if I don't get it out,
it'll kill all of us.

10:58.672 --> 11:00.474
An old Sumerian text
suggested that

11:00.508 --> 11:03.878
parasites like this might be
vulnerable to lightning, so...

11:03.912 --> 11:06.214
Oh, God.

11:06.247 --> 11:07.248
And...

11:07.281 --> 11:08.316
What are you doing?

11:10.284 --> 11:12.453
Oh...

11:14.355 --> 11:15.523
Damn it, it's dead.

11:15.556 --> 11:17.291
Quentin,

11:17.325 --> 11:19.227
tell her to put that thing down
right this instant.

11:19.260 --> 11:20.962
What are you doing here?

11:20.995 --> 11:22.430
Your cat exploded.
What did you expect me to do?

11:22.463 --> 11:24.265
Not, like, follow me home.
Jesus.

11:24.298 --> 11:26.000
Hold on, your cat exploded?

11:26.034 --> 11:28.269
Cats detect lampreys
by exploding.

11:28.302 --> 11:30.538
Ah!

11:30.571 --> 11:33.441
All of you, stay away from me!

11:33.474 --> 11:35.977
Oh, great.

11:36.010 --> 11:38.546
Now Carol won't
come over here anymore.

11:38.579 --> 11:40.281
Honey, I know
this really isn't the time,

11:40.314 --> 11:42.917
but shouldn't the lamprey
have come out of Carol

11:42.951 --> 11:44.285
after you shocked her?

11:44.318 --> 11:46.120
But the kitten freaked out
when it looked at Carol.

11:46.154 --> 11:49.023
Yeah, but Carol is a mess.
Maybe the cat could sense it.

11:49.057 --> 11:50.658
Maybe the lamprey isn't here.

11:50.691 --> 11:53.027
Yeah, well, maybe
the lamprey doesn't exist.

11:53.061 --> 11:54.963
The lamprey exists, Mother,

11:54.996 --> 11:56.430
and it can track
long distances,

11:56.464 --> 11:57.565
and it's coming for me.

11:57.598 --> 12:00.234
Why, what did you do to it?

12:00.268 --> 12:01.569
You wouldn't understand.

12:01.602 --> 12:03.471
Why don't you just try me?

12:03.504 --> 12:06.474
Whatever she did, she did it
because she was a niff in.

12:06.507 --> 12:09.110
Oh, God, Daniel,
I know she was a niff in.

12:09.143 --> 12:12.046
I thought she was dead
for months.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.314
Wait a second.

12:13.347 --> 12:16.350
You thought that Carol
had this lamprey in her,

12:16.384 --> 12:18.452
and you left me alone with her?

12:18.486 --> 12:20.654
I told you
to get away from her.

12:20.688 --> 12:25.059
Okay, you are the most
selfish daughter on the planet.

12:25.093 --> 12:28.196
Quentin,
what's going on with your neck?

12:28.229 --> 12:30.231
What do you mean?

12:30.264 --> 12:32.600
Honey, I thought
I saw Quentin's neck move.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.502
- What?
- Wait.

12:34.535 --> 12:36.270
Where did Quentin get to?

12:36.304 --> 12:38.172
Shit.

12:39.373 --> 12:42.576
We are very, very lucky
Her Majesty the Fairy Queen

12:42.610 --> 12:44.545
is so persuasive
with the Pegasi.

12:44.578 --> 12:46.547
They can be most
quarrelsome creatures.

12:46.580 --> 12:49.217
I smell like
a horse fucked a bird.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.585
Actually,
it was the other way around.

12:51.619 --> 12:54.022
I'm going to go
sun myself up here

12:54.055 --> 12:56.224
while you chat
with your pirates.

12:56.257 --> 12:57.725
But don't worry.

12:57.758 --> 13:00.561
I got my eye on you.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.598
Who are you lot supposed to be?

13:04.632 --> 13:07.201
I'm High Queen Margo
the Destroyer,

13:07.235 --> 13:09.370
and the entourage.

13:09.403 --> 13:10.638
You brought a fairy with you.

13:10.671 --> 13:12.373
You can see her?

13:12.406 --> 13:14.708
Yes, well, most pirates
have made a fairy deal

13:14.742 --> 13:16.210
at one time or another.

13:16.244 --> 13:18.312
My name is Hoop,
Ms. Destroyer.

13:18.346 --> 13:21.715
I'll take you below decks
to meet our pirate king.

13:24.818 --> 13:27.421
My queen, a word before you go?

13:27.455 --> 13:30.691
Perhaps you're familiar
with my family's reputation

13:30.724 --> 13:32.493
around the court
as pickpockets?

13:32.526 --> 13:34.128
I've heard.
What's your point?

13:34.162 --> 13:36.264
Um, only that
my skills in this field

13:36.297 --> 13:37.665
could be useful to you.

13:37.698 --> 13:38.732
Mmhmm,
I'll keep an eye on my jewels.

13:38.766 --> 13:41.135
Are we done here?

13:46.740 --> 13:49.677
Are you suggesting
that you could...

13:49.710 --> 13:52.346
Although her majesty
lacks depth perception,

13:52.380 --> 13:56.284
she does not lack
in depth or perception.

13:56.317 --> 13:59.487
You keep an eye on the pirates.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.289
If anything turns up missing,

14:01.322 --> 14:03.391
we'll know
they're the culprits.

14:03.424 --> 14:07.328
I shall catch up with you
below decks, ma'am.

14:11.732 --> 14:13.834
What on Earth are you doing?

14:13.867 --> 14:16.270
I can't afford
even the tiniest crack.

14:16.304 --> 14:17.838
When the lamprey
is outside the house,

14:17.871 --> 14:19.673
it can enter through
almost any opening.

14:19.707 --> 14:21.842
Why do you assume
the lamprey's even here?

14:21.875 --> 14:24.112
Maybe your boyfriend's
just looking for attention.

14:24.145 --> 14:26.480
Dad saw his neck move
and he's not my boyfriend.

14:26.514 --> 14:28.582
You really saw his neck move?

14:28.616 --> 14:30.318
You know,
without your optical spells,

14:30.351 --> 14:32.586
your vision really
isn't what it used to be.

14:32.620 --> 14:34.355
I mean, it looked weird.

14:34.388 --> 14:36.390
We can't risk it.
If the lamprey is in the house,

14:36.424 --> 14:39.360
we can't let it sneak back in
here and take over one of us.

14:39.393 --> 14:41.729
What if Quentin tries
to get back in here himself?

14:41.762 --> 14:43.331
We could call the police.

14:43.364 --> 14:45.666
They could come and
get him out of the house.

14:45.699 --> 14:47.235
Problem solved.

14:47.268 --> 14:48.569
That's a bad idea.
If it's inside Quentin,

14:48.602 --> 14:49.870
who knows what he'll do?

14:49.903 --> 14:51.639
They'll end up
shooting him dead.

14:51.672 --> 14:55.476
Well, you did say he wasn't
your boyfriend anymore.

14:55.509 --> 14:57.878
Okay, but killing Quentin
won't kill the lamprey.

14:57.911 --> 15:00.814
It'll end up jumping bodies,
and then we're up against

15:00.848 --> 15:03.751
a possessed cop with
a gun trying to kill us.

15:03.784 --> 15:06.187
I'm gonna need more wine.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.357
I knew I should've bought
a gun when magic went out.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.359
No, a gun won't protect us
against a lamprey.

15:11.392 --> 15:13.194
That is the only weapon
that we have,

15:13.227 --> 15:15.596
except the battery's dead.
We need a new one.

15:15.629 --> 15:16.864
There's a car in the garage.

15:16.897 --> 15:20.168
Don't those use
some kind of battery?

15:23.537 --> 15:25.173
Okay, now what are you doing?

15:25.206 --> 15:27.641
The lamprey can enter
through almost any orifice,

15:27.675 --> 15:30.478
even skin, so I'm going
to get that battery

15:30.511 --> 15:33.147
and I'm not taking any chances.

15:37.318 --> 15:38.386
Thank you.

15:38.419 --> 15:39.920
Yeah.

15:39.953 --> 15:43.524
You're missing the signs,
Julia.

15:43.557 --> 15:44.758
What?

15:44.792 --> 15:46.927
I thought
you'd be further along.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.464
We're going
to have to push you.

15:50.498 --> 15:53.301
What are you talking about?

15:53.334 --> 15:54.468
I said thank you.

15:54.502 --> 15:56.204
Oh.

15:56.237 --> 15:57.605
Sorry.

16:43.910 --> 16:45.345
Alice.

16:46.446 --> 16:48.548
Hey!

16:48.582 --> 16:49.949
Don't come any closer
or I'll smash your head in!

16:49.983 --> 16:51.585
Alice, come on!

16:51.618 --> 16:53.353
I'm not the lamprey, Alice!

16:53.387 --> 16:54.821
How do I know
you're not the lamprey!

16:54.854 --> 16:56.356
I don't know how to prove it.
I'm just, I'm not...

16:56.390 --> 16:58.091
it's... it's gone!
It left!

16:58.124 --> 16:59.759
What?

16:59.793 --> 17:02.496
Ah. Ugh.

17:02.529 --> 17:03.697
Why did it leave you?

17:03.730 --> 17:04.964
I don't know.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.137
I was awake the whole time.

17:12.171 --> 17:15.575
I could feel it controlling me
and searching my memory.

17:15.608 --> 17:18.978
It was... I just couldn't
do anything to stop it.

17:19.012 --> 17:20.914
It's angry at you, Alice.

17:20.946 --> 17:22.982
What did you do to it?

17:23.016 --> 17:24.117
I...

17:24.150 --> 17:25.117
I don't remember.

17:25.151 --> 17:27.387
It's weird.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.457
I could've snapped your neck
over there so easy.

17:30.490 --> 17:32.992
And the lamprey didn't want to
for some reason.

17:33.026 --> 17:36.129
Well, if it doesn't wanna
kill me, what does it want?

17:36.162 --> 17:39.499
I am taking
our daughter seriously.

17:39.533 --> 17:42.001
Help me finish taping up
the windows, won't you?

17:42.035 --> 17:43.470
Fine.

17:43.503 --> 17:45.939
But wouldn't it be nice
if just once,

17:45.972 --> 17:47.941
Alice would come
without bringing

17:47.974 --> 17:50.944
all of her drama with her?

17:58.918 --> 18:01.555
What's with the candy?

18:01.588 --> 18:03.557
You gonna summon some kind of

18:03.590 --> 18:05.892
chocolate-loving demon
to save my ass?

18:05.925 --> 18:10.897
The scent of chocolate makes
them less likely to eat us.

18:10.930 --> 18:13.467
I hope.

18:15.535 --> 18:19.606
The only nice thing
about losing magic?

18:19.639 --> 18:22.442
The radio signals
in my head went out too.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.878
All's quiet
on the psychic front?

18:24.911 --> 18:26.212
Yeah.

18:26.245 --> 18:28.782
Could get used to that.

18:31.217 --> 18:34.153
That's one of Mayakovsky's?

18:36.956 --> 18:38.191
Damn.

18:38.224 --> 18:39.893
You sure you wanna do this?

18:39.926 --> 18:41.961
There's a lot of magic in that.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.030
You sure you wanna
waste it on me?

18:44.063 --> 18:45.932
I stole it.

18:45.965 --> 18:47.467
It's my call.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.203
You don't owe me anything,
Kady.

18:50.236 --> 18:53.640
Of course you'd say that.

18:53.673 --> 18:57.010
You got poisoned
trying to help me.

18:57.043 --> 18:58.878
If I didn't try to help you,
I...

18:58.912 --> 19:01.881
I couldn't live with myself.

19:01.915 --> 19:03.950
Guess I should say thanks.

19:03.983 --> 19:05.785
Yeah, you should.

19:19.098 --> 19:21.234
Julia will be back soon.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.970
I will try

19:24.003 --> 19:25.104
not to die.

19:28.207 --> 19:31.144
I appreciate that.

19:46.893 --> 19:48.094
Good job, Tick.

19:48.127 --> 19:49.863
Your praise is everything,

19:49.896 --> 19:52.131
but I would also like
a country estate.

19:52.165 --> 19:54.901
Don't get greedy.

19:57.771 --> 20:01.274
Queen Margo the Destroyer,
my king.

20:01.307 --> 20:03.877
You're the pirate king?

20:03.910 --> 20:07.981
As king, I get to be called
whatever the fuck I want.

20:08.014 --> 20:09.616
That's fine by me.

20:09.649 --> 20:14.588
I'm here to motherfucking
parlay, Ms. King.

20:15.622 --> 20:17.724
Maybe you and I could, uh,

20:17.757 --> 20:21.761
take a private cabin and parlay
a thing or two on our own.

20:21.795 --> 20:23.229
Yeah, I'm hot.

20:23.262 --> 20:25.732
You're extremely hot yourself.

20:25.765 --> 20:29.135
But you just took over
my goddamn boat,

20:29.168 --> 20:31.137
which tells me you're not one

20:31.170 --> 20:33.239
to pay attention
to a safe word.

20:33.272 --> 20:35.074
What's a safe word?

20:35.108 --> 20:36.776
Exactly.

20:36.810 --> 20:41.080
I'm here on business,
not pleasure.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.649
But, um...

20:42.682 --> 20:45.652
you give me what I want,

20:45.685 --> 20:48.888
I won't take anything
off the table.

20:48.922 --> 20:50.857
Hmm.

20:50.890 --> 20:54.160
Never could control myself
around a one-eyed girl.

20:54.193 --> 20:56.095
Well,

20:56.129 --> 20:59.265
we've all got a thing.

20:59.298 --> 21:02.669
I need to see High King Eliot.

21:02.702 --> 21:04.604
Now.

21:08.842 --> 21:11.010
Mm-hmm.

21:20.119 --> 21:21.320
My queen!

21:21.354 --> 21:23.156
It is I,
your High King Eliot...

21:23.189 --> 21:27.293
In the flesh.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.284
So,
you think it left the house?

21:34.402 --> 21:36.371
Yes, and we need to find
out what it really wanted

21:36.404 --> 21:37.905
before it comes back.

21:37.938 --> 21:39.607
I have some pre-Christian
volumes that might be useful,

21:39.640 --> 21:41.309
but I was thinking
we might be better off

21:41.342 --> 21:42.810
avoiding the Fertile Crescent.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.512
I was thinking Asian myself.

21:44.545 --> 21:46.614
Uh, Stephanie, we really
need to stay put here.

21:46.647 --> 21:48.449
But you said
it left the house.

21:48.483 --> 21:51.352
Yeah, but it's going
to come back, we think.

21:51.386 --> 21:52.520
- Mom.
- Darling...

21:52.553 --> 21:53.788
I have to go to the bathroom.

21:53.821 --> 21:55.656
There's one right out there.

21:55.690 --> 21:56.924
Don't you think
we would've heard it

21:56.957 --> 21:58.259
if it had come back inside?

21:58.293 --> 21:59.594
Mom, the lamprey is tiny,

21:59.627 --> 22:00.928
but it is a powerful
magical creature.

22:00.961 --> 22:02.497
Don't underestimate it.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.899
First you said
it was inside of Carol,

22:04.932 --> 22:06.534
so you electrocuted her.

22:06.567 --> 22:08.669
Then you said
it was inside of Quentin,

22:08.703 --> 22:10.205
only now he's back,

22:10.238 --> 22:12.540
and the creature's gone
for some reason.

22:12.573 --> 22:15.276
Am I the only one
that this sounds crazy to?

22:15.310 --> 22:16.477
Stephanie, sweetheart...

22:16.511 --> 22:18.479
No, Daniel, don't defend her.

22:18.513 --> 22:21.582
We've both been in this room
for God knows how long,

22:21.616 --> 22:23.284
and I have to pee.

22:23.318 --> 22:25.420
Are you really gonna
stop me from doing that?

22:25.453 --> 22:26.921
Just go in the corner, Mom.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.589
I am not peeing
in front of your father.

22:28.623 --> 22:30.525
If I had wanted
that in my marriage,

22:30.558 --> 22:32.293
I would've stayed
with Jean Claude.

22:32.327 --> 22:33.861
Ugh, I don't wanna hear this.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.664
No, Alice, mystery is not
something you can take back.

22:36.697 --> 22:38.833
And I am not gonna risk it
just because you think

22:38.866 --> 22:43.704
that you stepped on
some creature's magical toes.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.840
I didn't step on its toes.

22:45.873 --> 22:47.575
I murdered its entire family.

22:47.608 --> 22:49.844
I did experiments on them
to figure out

22:49.877 --> 22:50.978
what kind of magic they had.

22:51.011 --> 22:53.314
That's what I did as a niff in.

22:53.348 --> 22:55.250
Jesus, Alice.

22:55.283 --> 22:58.586
Well, you know, we've all dealt
with our share of monsters.

22:58.619 --> 22:59.854
You don't get it.

22:59.887 --> 23:02.957
I did that kind of thing
over and over again, okay?

23:02.990 --> 23:06.261
The lamprey is not the only
creature that wants me dead.

23:06.294 --> 23:07.995
It's just the one
who got my number.

23:08.028 --> 23:10.331
So, I wanna be absolutely clear

23:10.365 --> 23:13.701
on who the real monster
is here.

23:15.903 --> 23:17.705
Excuse me.

23:26.847 --> 23:27.882
That didn't really help.

23:27.915 --> 23:29.517
I know.

23:29.550 --> 23:32.987
I know, it just gets
under my skin sometimes.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.556
Okay, I'll go after her.

23:35.590 --> 23:37.325
Just you and your dad
keep researching.

23:37.358 --> 23:40.961
My Asian languages are
for shit, anyway.

23:40.995 --> 23:42.897
You better tape up.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.031
Yeah.

23:44.064 --> 23:45.900
- Just to be safe.
- Yeah.

23:45.933 --> 23:47.635
So, brass tacks.

23:47.668 --> 23:51.372
You want 3,000
Fillorian Gold Crescents?

23:51.406 --> 23:53.341
It's been rough going
since magic went away.

23:53.374 --> 23:55.376
I'm crying from
my one eye for you.

23:55.410 --> 23:57.978
There is,
uh, one more matter.

23:58.012 --> 24:00.047
Our ship, the Sika,

24:00.080 --> 24:02.583
is a Deer Class vessel
like yours.

24:02.617 --> 24:03.518
So?

24:03.551 --> 24:05.520
So, it's been a dry voyage.

24:05.553 --> 24:08.789
It's no coincidence
we met like this.

24:08.823 --> 24:12.393
The Sika sought out the Muntjac
after he scented her.

24:12.427 --> 24:14.929
And now he needs her to submit.

24:16.697 --> 24:17.765
What?

24:17.798 --> 24:20.768
Our boat wants
to fuck your boat.

24:20.801 --> 24:23.604
And we can't leave
until he does.

24:25.606 --> 24:28.443
Deer Class ships are
magical creatures of a sort,

24:28.476 --> 24:31.078
and as such,
they have the same sort of

24:31.111 --> 24:32.947
biological urges we do.

24:32.980 --> 24:35.516
Although, our ship
is subject to royal command.

24:35.550 --> 24:39.019
Which I couldn't give,
but you can.

24:39.053 --> 24:40.721
So, what?

24:40.755 --> 24:41.989
I just tell our boat
to spread it for their boat

24:42.022 --> 24:44.425
and we're done?

24:44.459 --> 24:45.893
What are you not telling me?

24:45.926 --> 24:49.630
Well, the boat can be upset
by the experience.

24:49.664 --> 24:52.032
They're not the same after.

24:52.066 --> 24:54.101
Not the same?

24:54.134 --> 24:55.570
Like, how?

24:55.603 --> 24:58.373
They become distracted,
irritable.

24:58.406 --> 24:59.907
Sometimes,
they can't sail right.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.510
Some ships have
to be put into dry dock,

25:02.543 --> 25:03.911
never to sail again.

25:03.944 --> 25:07.348
That sounds like PTSD.

25:09.083 --> 25:13.421
So, these pirates are asking us
to let our boat get raped?

25:13.454 --> 25:16.824
My queen's words,
as always, are coarse,

25:16.857 --> 25:18.426
but truthful.

25:18.459 --> 25:19.894
I love this old boat,

25:19.927 --> 25:22.129
but if they don't get
what they want,

25:22.162 --> 25:24.499
the pirates will kill the crew.

25:48.556 --> 25:51.659
That's a new look for you.

25:51.692 --> 25:53.594
Would you come back with me?
It's not safe in here.

25:53.628 --> 25:55.596
Oh, you heard Alice.

25:55.630 --> 25:57.031
She's the monster.

25:57.064 --> 25:59.900
Come on, she's not
a monster, she's just...

25:59.934 --> 26:00.968
conflicted.

26:01.001 --> 26:02.970
What's it matter?

26:03.003 --> 26:06.441
It's not safe anywhere.

26:06.474 --> 26:09.477
Did you know we got
a tax bill for the house?

26:09.510 --> 26:12.012
Apparently,
we haven't paid in 30 years.

26:12.046 --> 26:16.784
Enchantment failed,
so now we're losing our home.

26:16.817 --> 26:20.921
I mean, what are we
gonna do without magic?

26:20.955 --> 26:23.924
I mean, get fucking jobs?

26:23.958 --> 26:27.061
I don't even know
how to do anything.

26:27.094 --> 26:28.696
And Daniel.

26:28.729 --> 26:31.799
There's no place
for us in this world.

26:31.832 --> 26:34.168
Sometimes I think

26:34.201 --> 26:37.572
Charlie was the one
who got off easy.

26:42.577 --> 26:44.845
Ah, shit.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.953
I am Asteroth.

27:27.855 --> 27:31.592
Astaroth,
Demon of the Seventh Circle,

27:31.626 --> 27:33.694
Great Duke of The Inferno.

27:33.728 --> 27:35.630
Oh, no, I'm Asteroth with an E.

27:35.663 --> 27:38.533
Astaroth with an A
is my cousin.

27:38.566 --> 27:39.934
You can totally stand.

27:39.967 --> 27:43.237
The whole
kneeling thing's weird.

27:57.151 --> 27:59.119
It's pretty advanced,

27:59.153 --> 28:01.722
and it'll be tough to extract.

28:01.756 --> 28:05.192
Though, those are the tastiest.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.562
Can you do anything?

28:07.595 --> 28:09.564
Surgery.

28:09.597 --> 28:12.132
But it will hurt.

28:27.047 --> 28:28.649
Just, save it, okay?

28:28.683 --> 28:30.651
You'd astrally project, too.

28:30.685 --> 28:33.020
No shame, bro.

28:40.110 --> 28:42.680
Oh, my head is swimming.

28:42.713 --> 28:45.049
I can't read Chinese right now.

28:45.082 --> 28:46.417
How do you read so fast?

28:46.451 --> 28:47.918
This isn't fast.

28:47.952 --> 28:49.954
When I was a niff in, I didn't
have to rely on my eyes.

28:49.987 --> 28:51.989
This is like
running through water.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.525
It's so slow.

28:54.559 --> 28:57.428
What you said to your mother,
is that true?

28:57.462 --> 29:01.366
What you did to that
lamprey's family?

29:01.399 --> 29:02.867
When I was a niff in,

29:02.900 --> 29:05.603
there was nothing I wouldn't
have done for knowledge.

29:08.105 --> 29:09.774
Wait, hold on.

29:09.807 --> 29:11.576
What is it?

29:11.609 --> 29:15.446
A description of the life
cycle of a magical creature.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.948
It's a parasite
similar to the lamprey.

29:17.982 --> 29:20.385
I think I know what it's doing.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.857
So, um, Muntjac?

29:26.891 --> 29:30.395
I'm High Queen Margo
of Fillory.

29:30.428 --> 29:32.497
Your Liege.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.765
I have a kind of problem.

29:34.799 --> 29:36.501
See,

29:36.534 --> 29:38.869
a bunch of pirates boarded you

29:38.903 --> 29:40.971
and are threatening
to kill the crew

29:41.005 --> 29:45.075
if I don't order you
to lie with their boat.

29:45.109 --> 29:49.680
Before this, I used to think
that pirates were kinda cute

29:49.714 --> 29:52.683
in a Johnny Depp sort of way,
but the fact is,

29:52.717 --> 29:56.687
the real thing is kinda
dirty and fucked up...

29:56.721 --> 29:59.657
in a Johnny Depp sort of way.

30:02.026 --> 30:04.128
Look...

30:04.161 --> 30:05.863
I could just
order you to do it,

30:05.896 --> 30:08.799
but you're clearly alive,
whatever that means.

30:08.833 --> 30:11.902
You have thoughts
and feelings...

30:11.936 --> 30:14.138
I think.

30:14.171 --> 30:17.542
So, I guess I'm asking...

30:18.643 --> 30:20.711
What do you wanna do?

30:27.952 --> 30:31.556
Maybe I'm an idiot
for even asking.

30:41.832 --> 30:44.068
There, there.

30:45.870 --> 30:47.905
Gonna be okay.

30:49.139 --> 30:52.943
I mean, look at me.

30:52.977 --> 30:54.512
I'm a mess.

30:54.545 --> 30:57.515
I have to clean myself up.

30:57.548 --> 30:59.950
I do, I have to clean myself...

31:01.619 --> 31:03.087
What are you...
no, no, no, no.

31:05.255 --> 31:06.924
Oh.

31:06.957 --> 31:07.992
What the hell?

31:08.025 --> 31:10.160
Uh, no, she was, um,

31:10.194 --> 31:13.864
kissing me, and um, I'm just...
stop, I'm trying to...

31:14.865 --> 31:17.968
Oh, please,
we're both adults.

31:18.002 --> 31:19.236
You don't get to judge.

31:19.269 --> 31:20.571
Step away from him, Mom.

31:20.605 --> 31:21.772
Stephanie, do you honestly

31:21.806 --> 31:23.508
have to make this
about you too?

31:23.541 --> 31:25.576
Oh, don't psychoanalyze me,
Daniel.

31:25.610 --> 31:26.977
Back away, Mom.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.846
- Don't raise your voice to me.
- Oh, God.

31:28.879 --> 31:30.581
Her-her neck...
she's the lamprey.

31:30.615 --> 31:32.783
What?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

31:32.817 --> 31:34.585
I saw it.
Her neck moved.

31:34.619 --> 31:36.854
I told you to back
the fuck away from him!

31:42.893 --> 31:43.994
What?

31:44.028 --> 31:46.864
The lamprey should
leave her body.

31:46.897 --> 31:48.566
Any moment now.

31:48.599 --> 31:50.134
I swear to God,
she kissed me.

31:50.167 --> 31:51.936
Shut up, Quentin.

31:51.969 --> 31:54.739
You think she was trying
to switch bodies with me?

31:54.772 --> 31:56.273
Anything's possible.

31:56.306 --> 31:57.742
The lamprey
already took you over.

31:57.775 --> 31:59.810
It doesn't wanna
kill us because it...

31:59.844 --> 32:03.247
wants to lay eggs inside of us.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.916
And then what?

32:07.017 --> 32:09.654
And then it hatches and
burrows into your brain stem

32:09.687 --> 32:11.722
until you die,
and then feeds on the carcass.

32:11.756 --> 32:13.991
I don't understand.

32:14.024 --> 32:18.295
The lamprey should've
left her by now.

32:18.328 --> 32:20.030
Unless it hasn't
left Quentin.

32:20.064 --> 32:21.766
- Oh, God.
- No.

32:21.799 --> 32:23.701
He was trying to kiss her
so that the lamprey

32:23.734 --> 32:25.002
would jump into her body.

32:25.035 --> 32:27.037
No.

32:27.071 --> 32:28.238
Stay away from me!

32:28.272 --> 32:29.306
Quentin...

32:29.339 --> 32:31.576
I am not the lamprey.

32:31.609 --> 32:34.178
This isn't really
a great way to prove that.

32:34.211 --> 32:37.915
If you're not the lamprey,
then put that down, okay?

32:37.948 --> 32:39.617
Okay, so there's only
one way for me to prove

32:39.650 --> 32:43.220
that I'm not the lamprey,
and when I do it...

32:43.253 --> 32:45.656
you'll know what to do.

33:04.341 --> 33:06.143
Oh, bravo.

33:06.176 --> 33:07.945
Nicely done.

33:07.978 --> 33:09.714
You got me.

33:09.747 --> 33:11.982
I'm gonna give you
one chance to leave my dad.

33:12.016 --> 33:13.718
Or what?

33:13.751 --> 33:16.654
You'll kill me?

33:16.687 --> 33:18.589
You killed my family.

33:18.623 --> 33:19.957
That wasn't me.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.225
I don't remember
what I did as a niff in.

33:21.258 --> 33:22.593
Alice, I know you're lying.

33:22.627 --> 33:24.128
Your father could always tell.

33:24.161 --> 33:26.030
That little twitch you get.

33:26.063 --> 33:28.699
You murdered every one
of my children

33:28.733 --> 33:30.300
because you were
seeking knowledge.

33:30.334 --> 33:32.703
So, what did you learn

33:32.737 --> 33:35.706
by torturing each one
of them to death, hmm?

33:35.740 --> 33:38.008
I wanna know.

33:39.243 --> 33:42.813
I wasn't seeking knowledge.

33:42.847 --> 33:47.151
When they died,
they made pretty little lights.

33:48.052 --> 33:51.889
And when they died slowly,
the lights got even prettier.

33:55.025 --> 33:57.394
It's funny the things
you can sense from the inside.

33:57.427 --> 34:00.097
That one still loves you.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.969
And your father
has a weak heart.

34:05.002 --> 34:07.404
He'll die
if you try to shock me.

34:07.437 --> 34:08.773
You don't know that.

34:08.806 --> 34:10.274
You really wanna risk it?

34:10.306 --> 34:14.178
And I'm sorry I wasn't able
to lay my eggs into her.

34:15.746 --> 34:18.748
Since I know
how much you hate her,

34:18.783 --> 34:21.851
it's crueler
to leave her alive.

34:21.886 --> 34:27.324
Well, thank you
for finally being honest.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.760
I'll let myself out.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.789
Thank God.

34:58.823 --> 35:01.025
Kill it, Alice.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.835
Congratulations.

35:43.869 --> 35:46.137
Jesus Christ.

35:46.171 --> 35:47.839
What did you do?

35:47.873 --> 35:51.276
I was moved by
your speech to the Muntjac,

35:51.309 --> 35:54.279
coming to her defense.

35:54.312 --> 35:58.449
So, I decided to intervene.

35:58.483 --> 36:02.487
We got what we needed
from these pirates.

36:03.789 --> 36:05.156
What?

36:05.190 --> 36:06.892
You stood up to them.

36:06.925 --> 36:08.860
You were a queen.

36:08.894 --> 36:10.896
That's who I need you to be.

36:10.929 --> 36:15.033
The next time they don't plant
a field of mushrooms for you,

36:15.066 --> 36:17.002
remember this room.

36:19.404 --> 36:21.773
Now...

36:21.807 --> 36:24.843
there's the matter
of your lying to me.

36:24.876 --> 36:29.080
Did you think I wouldn't be
a queen with you?

36:29.114 --> 36:32.083
Time to give it back.

36:37.823 --> 36:39.390
It's my eye.

36:39.424 --> 36:41.793
It was,

36:41.827 --> 36:46.231
but you made a deal.

36:46.264 --> 36:49.801
Tick, Gillen, come here.

36:50.535 --> 36:53.338
Someone has stolen
something from me.

36:53.371 --> 36:55.206
Which one of you was it?

36:55.240 --> 36:58.443
They didn't do this.

36:58.476 --> 37:00.011
I did.

37:00.045 --> 37:04.115
Fine, we do it your way.

37:05.416 --> 37:09.020
Thrimble dimble pickle plum,

37:09.054 --> 37:14.192
catch a human by the... tongue.

37:30.876 --> 37:32.878
You may go.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.148
What did you do?

37:37.182 --> 37:38.950
There is a song
he does not like,

37:38.984 --> 37:42.153
so I put it in his ear,
where it will never leave.

37:42.187 --> 37:44.422
He will slowly go mad,

37:44.455 --> 37:47.859
then he will not be
of much use to you.

37:47.893 --> 37:49.494
My eye.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.406
The eye can never be fixed.

38:01.439 --> 38:04.042
But you can't
spy on me anymore.

38:04.075 --> 38:07.545
Do you think this is the only
way to know what you're doing?

38:07.578 --> 38:10.048
You have a week's sail
back to Whitespire

38:10.081 --> 38:13.051
to think about
what you've done.

38:17.188 --> 38:19.390
Thank you, Your Highness,
for not telling her about me.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.993
Shut the fuck up, Tick.

38:33.571 --> 38:35.540
What the hell
did you put in that?

38:35.573 --> 38:38.309
It should kill any
of the eggs left inside of you.

38:38.343 --> 38:39.544
Did you drink it all?

38:39.577 --> 38:40.912
Mmm

38:44.182 --> 38:47.152
When you left Brakebills,

38:47.185 --> 38:50.588
you said that
you couldn't forgive me.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.958
Was that real?

38:54.125 --> 38:55.961
Didn't it feel real?

38:55.994 --> 38:58.529
I thought it might've
been that thing you do

38:58.563 --> 39:02.233
where you push me away
in order to protect me.

39:03.368 --> 39:06.337
From the lamprey, or...

39:06.371 --> 39:08.306
I mean, I could tell
you were fine with things

39:08.339 --> 39:11.309
just going on the way
they were, it's just,

39:11.342 --> 39:14.712
sort of sleeping together,
or whenever...

39:14.745 --> 39:17.015
There were two of us
doing that, Alice.

39:17.048 --> 39:18.083
It wasn't just me.

39:18.116 --> 39:19.084
Yeah, I know.

39:19.117 --> 39:20.518
I...

39:20.551 --> 39:23.121
I know that,
and it felt good,

39:23.154 --> 39:24.589
I'm not saying that it didn't,

39:24.622 --> 39:27.392
and I'm not mad at you, Q.

39:28.359 --> 39:31.162
I'm just...
I'm not that girl anymore.

39:31.196 --> 39:34.332
And I can't ever be her again.
I don't know how.

39:34.365 --> 39:36.467
I know that
I have said this before

39:36.501 --> 39:39.971
and that it probably
sounds ridiculous.

39:40.005 --> 39:42.340
I just wanna help.

39:43.674 --> 39:44.642
I really mean it.

39:44.675 --> 39:47.712
Yeah, I know.
I know you do.

39:47.745 --> 39:50.381
I just...

39:50.415 --> 39:53.985
I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

39:54.019 --> 39:56.054
I don't know what I want.

39:56.087 --> 39:57.989
That's okay.

39:58.023 --> 40:00.091
It's confusing.

40:00.125 --> 40:04.295
I lived this whole other life,

40:04.329 --> 40:07.332
and a part of that is still
who I am,

40:07.365 --> 40:10.068
whether I like it or not.

40:10.101 --> 40:12.603
But when you look at me,

40:12.637 --> 40:18.109
all I see is that Alice
reflecting back in your eyes.

40:18.143 --> 40:19.510
The old Alice, like...

40:19.544 --> 40:21.379
like that's who
you want me to be.

40:21.412 --> 40:23.414
She's gone.

40:25.083 --> 40:28.553
It's just...
it makes it too hard, Quentin.

40:31.056 --> 40:33.691
Alice!

40:33.724 --> 40:34.792
Daniel!

40:34.825 --> 40:37.328
Alice!

40:37.362 --> 40:39.197
Daniel!

40:39.230 --> 40:41.299
Oh, my God.

41:23.874 --> 41:26.844
I think I've got it.

41:26.877 --> 41:28.479
Ooh, it's juicy.

41:28.513 --> 41:31.048
I'll save it for later.

41:36.554 --> 41:38.823
I'll close the wound.

41:38.856 --> 41:42.360
It may take him
some time to heal.

41:42.393 --> 41:44.329
Thank you.

41:54.439 --> 41:56.174
Penny?

41:56.207 --> 41:58.176
Penny.

41:58.209 --> 41:59.377
Penny?

41:59.410 --> 42:00.811
Penny.

42:00.845 --> 42:03.414
No.

42:03.448 --> 42:05.316
Penny, come on.

42:05.350 --> 42:08.453
I'm sorry.

42:08.486 --> 42:10.221
You called me too late.

42:10.255 --> 42:12.390
No, no, no, he can't.

42:12.423 --> 42:13.591
No, come on, Penny.

42:13.624 --> 42:15.593
Don't... don't, come on.

42:15.626 --> 42:17.662
No.

42:17.695 --> 42:19.264
No.

42:27.305 --> 42:29.574
Shit.
