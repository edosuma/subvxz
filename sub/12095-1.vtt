01:00.480 --> 01:04.235
The Balkans, 1996

02:26.520 --> 02:29.354
A lot is coming.
Prepare them.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.873
Look after them.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.677
Upsters. Now!
Upstairs.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.753
Come out!

03:23.440 --> 03:26.956
Move!
Line up.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.154
Watever life you knew...

04:01.320 --> 04:02.959
is gone.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.360
There's nothiung outside these walls
for you to believe anymore.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.359
Your life, now, is here,
with me.

04:29.200 --> 04:35.549
But... do not think you won't be safe.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.280
I look after everything I own.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.840
From now on, when you look at me...

04:42.000 --> 04:43.992
you will know who to thank.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.111
But... nothing cones for free.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.196
You will work for me.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.474
You will learn how to be kind
to my friends.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.713
But don't dare
ask them for help.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.760
Ever.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.198
I wanto to know if I can trust you,
just as you can trust me.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.159
It's all right.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.959
It's all right.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.150
Trust. That's all I ask.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.031
Out! Out!

06:22.200 --> 06:23.998
Come on.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.632
What about this one?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.193
Leave her with me.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.472
Hide. Now.
In the wardrobe.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.352
Just do what I say.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.952
Go away!

15:05.360 --> 15:08.751
Help me, please.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.478
Please.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.591
Help me.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.479
No, wait.
Wait!

15:49.320 --> 15:50.993
That one!

16:55.640 --> 16:57.552
Get out!

17:44.360 --> 17:48.094
Good.
All right.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.514
We have guests.
Get them ready.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.434
Enjoy.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.152
What's your name?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.920
Can't you hear me?

19:17.200 --> 19:19.396
Come on, come on.
They are waiting.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.950
Goodbye.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.069
So...
Hear no evil, speak no evil?

21:45.160 --> 21:47.436
Do you have a name?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.078
You can't speak your name.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.791
But you have to have a name.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.357
A little angel.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.077
I shall call you Angel.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.233
Viktor.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.077
It's all right.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.351
It's all right.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.436
Viktor will look after you.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.559
And you ...

23:23.160 --> 23:25.197
will look after me.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.234
But ...

23:31.160 --> 23:33.834
I have something else
for you to do.

23:36.120 --> 23:40.512
You wil look after the house
and prepare the girls.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.358
I will show you how.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.551
How do you know how to sign.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.913
My father was deaf.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.359
Where is your father?

25:06.320 --> 25:08.516
He's dead.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.396
And aabout yours?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.918
Wil you came back?

26:04.360 --> 26:08.639
I wish mom and dad
arguing and fighting stop.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.679
I wish dad would go away.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.713
Do not worry.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.879
You get get out? Escape?

27:57.080 --> 27:58.799
It's impossible.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.270
Everywhere is locked.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.954
Have you always been deaf?

28:29.120 --> 28:31.191
Since I was a baby.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.236
Where is your family?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.798
I don't know.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.519
I'm sorry.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.794
Your mother?

28:51.320 --> 28:53.312
She will find me one day.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.270
I like your necklace.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.034
As long as you wear this ...

29:22.200 --> 29:25.352
it will allways protect you.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.032
What is the matter?

31:11.280 --> 31:14.512
Please. It helps.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.280
What's wrong with you? Go!

32:40.120 --> 32:41.600
Get out!

33:37.600 --> 33:39.717
He likes to be rough with them.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.959
He pays extra.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.192
I'll call Andre.

34:05.560 --> 34:10.112
You have some bruising
and a little tear down there.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.914
But out from that,
you will be ok.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.880
Her pelvis was broken, Viktor.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.759
You need to take better care of your stock.

34:30.920 --> 34:35.312
- And I can't afford to loose more girls.
- Your loss.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.599
You forget yourself, Andre.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.795
And you have a short memory.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.911
Just take your payment and leave.

34:48.080 --> 34:52.313
But and for her?
She is in no fit state.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.434
You're an expert in anatomy, AndrÃ©.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.354
I'm sure she can provide you with options.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.231
Just do what you do.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.474
The doctor has to finish treating her.,
Prepare the other girls.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.677
Then food.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.117
I can hear something.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.272
Come to my room.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.436
One day...

38:21.720 --> 38:26.511
one day things will be different.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.070
We can go away from this place.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.835
This is why I do all of this.
So we can be together.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.676
I am going to give you something.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.554
This unlocks eveything.

38:52.720 --> 38:56.953
The girls rooms,
the outer doors.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.434
Freedom, if you wanted.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.199
You are free to go if you want.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.317
I won't follow you.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.030
But I know you won't.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.672
Because you love me
as I love you.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.999
You could never leave me,
could you?

40:12.040 --> 40:15.670
I dreamed about us
getting out of this place.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.318
I'm never gettin out of here, am I?

40:31.120 --> 40:35.478
Promise me you wont let them
kill me. Promise me.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.318
What is going on?

41:14.080 --> 41:15.673
Dope her up!

41:30.960 --> 41:34.954
Stay here. Keep a close eye on her.
I'll deal with him.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.432
Goran!

43:12.720 --> 43:15.030
Greetings, Viktor.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.160
It's so good to see you again.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.035
- I had no idea you were back.
- That's good.

43:30.200 --> 43:35.400
I'm happy to learn there's still
some discretion left in this world.

43:36.680 --> 43:41.755
We were passing, so I thought
to come and use your "amenities".

43:41.920 --> 43:43.912
Whatever you need.
You know that.

43:44.080 --> 43:48.438
You know my...
my beautiful baby brother?

43:53.960 --> 43:58.113
Josif!
In the militia?

43:58.360 --> 44:00.716
Private security consultant.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.795
Things are different now.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.871
- And hese are your men?
- Radovan.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.872
And Marko.
Marko!

44:12.360 --> 44:14.670
And of course Ivan.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.355
Ivan. I've seen him before.

44:19.520 --> 44:22.115
He's hard to miss.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.792
Still with the little mute?

44:37.960 --> 44:42.910
You old devil, she must be keeping you
more entretained than the others, no?

44:43.600 --> 44:45.319
She works hard.

44:45.480 --> 44:49.520
Listen. I need to have a private chat,
just you and me

44:50.040 --> 44:51.838
Of course.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.789
And you boys, you have some fun.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.879
A drink?

47:36.480 --> 47:40.759
- Why are you here, Goran?
- Oh, we were in the area.

47:40.920 --> 47:43.913
My men, as you know,
have been working very hard.

47:44.080 --> 47:49.439
It would be cruel to deny them some
pleasures, so as we were passing...

47:49.600 --> 47:51.717
Passing?
To where, exactly?

47:53.520 --> 47:56.240
I'm not the best of the liars,
am I, Viktor?

47:58.040 --> 48:02.432
I could say that I like to keep track
of the fortune of my former colleagues.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.956
But you wouldtn't believe,
would you?

48:06.440 --> 48:08.671
You're too clever for that.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.556
Then, why are you here?

48:16.600 --> 48:20.640
Lists, Viktor. Lists.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.712
Lists?

48:22.880 --> 48:25.918
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

48:26.080 --> 48:28.117
How very curious.

48:30.040 --> 48:34.796
It appears that our names
are gaining attention.

48:36.120 --> 48:41.115
Attention, businessmen as ourselves
could do without.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.279
About what?

48:43.440 --> 48:47.400
About some other more colorful exploits
from the last campaign.

48:49.360 --> 48:54.515
Apparently we carried our duties with much
entusiasm.

49:23.920 --> 49:28.870
- How's your relationship with the authorities here?
- They are my best customers.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.716
The authorities I speak of
have a longer reach...

49:32.880 --> 49:36.271
than the ones of your
mini business here.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.640
Have you been talking to anyone?

49:45.640 --> 49:47.950
May I remind you, Viktor...

49:48.160 --> 49:52.439
that the ink on your hand may grant you
some privileges around here...

49:52.600 --> 49:56.719
but to people outside, it is not more
than a signed confession.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.758
I'm just saying, Viktor.

50:03.400 --> 50:06.996
To some of our colleagues, 
denying involvement in events...

50:07.160 --> 50:11.473
seem more appealing than taking
full responsibility for theyr actions.

50:12.720 --> 50:17.272
Our resposability in face
of our former friends.

50:17.440 --> 50:20.319
Is that why you're here?
Worried I betray you?

50:20.480 --> 50:23.951
Us, Viktor. Betray us.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.440
I'm warning you.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.678
Shut the door.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.673
Other side.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.360
Ivan?

55:20.800 --> 55:22.439
Ivan, open the door.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.030
Ivan, open the fucking door.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.960
What happens there, damn it?

55:35.040 --> 55:36.759
Ivan?

56:11.320 --> 56:12.413
Viktor.

56:07.113 --> 56:08.113
Viktor!

56:24.920 --> 56:28.391
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.753
Listen.

56:44.320 --> 56:46.039
What the hell is that?

57:04.480 --> 57:06.437
Who is missing?

57:08.320 --> 57:11.199
Where is that little mute of yours?

57:11.440 --> 57:13.318
I don't know.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.599
Fuck off.

57:16.720 --> 57:20.873
Listen to me. I just lost one of
my best fucking men.

57:21.040 --> 57:23.396
And I'm just not a girl.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.239
Two.

57:35.880 --> 57:39.271
It's that freak, the mute.
Find her.

57:39.440 --> 57:41.352
Now.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.720
Every window, every door.
No one comes in or out.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.679
If you see them, you kill them dead.
Go!

58:16.240 --> 58:18.072
I want to talk to you.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.749
You turn up with your militia...

58:21.920 --> 58:25.880
I go where and when I pease.
Do you understand me, Viktor?

58:26.040 --> 58:29.112
Now you have a dead man,
and I have two dead girls...

58:29.280 --> 58:33.638
- Your house, your responsibility.
- Your man killed my girl.

58:33.800 --> 58:38.875
She dies. Let that
get in your blunt head.

58:45.520 --> 58:48.319
On principle she dies.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.671
She's gone.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.720
Come here.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.912
Goran, there.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.510
Gotcha!

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.439
The knife.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.117
What happened to your face?

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.758
We'll get her.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.753
Josif, move, move.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.354
Marko?

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.032
- Get in.
- All right.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.750
That fucking girl in there...

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.311
Damn, the bitch.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.038
She's got my fucking gun.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.356
- So, Viktor, the house is locked down, yes?
- Yes.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.470
I think not, my friend.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.916
What the hell is going on?
This is my property.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.437
Smoke her out.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.189
- Goran.
- Speak.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.317
Ground floor clear.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.150
Keep your eyes and ears open.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.560
She shot him.
Now she's back in the vent.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.513
Bitch.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.353
What now?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.954
What now?

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.476
Now we burn this fucking house down.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.356
What the fuck is that?

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.032
Go, go, go, go!

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.832
She's gone into the woods.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.680
Radios on.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.273
There.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.553
Watch him.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.037
What the fuck, Viktor?

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.232
It's all right.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.433
It's me.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.633
It's me.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.198
I won't hurt you.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.116
We don't have time for this.
If they find you...

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:47.953
they will kill you.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.037
Let me help.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:56.752
You know I would never let
anything happen to you.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.320
Just trust me.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.557
Please, Angel.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.237
Give me the knife.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.470
I won't let anyone hurt you.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.632
Have any ideal of what you've done?

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.634
Any fucking idea?

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.671
I kept you safe.
I gave you a home.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.916
You fucking freak.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.956
How very touching.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.997
She is yours.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.038
We're even now.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.315
Oh, look at you.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.316
Always the corageous Viktor,
hiding behind little girls.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.235
Don't point the fucking finger at me.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.872
All right.

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:52.072
All right.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.035
Think.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.918
About the money.
The money.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.640
How much did they offer you?
And how much you propose

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.030
for the loss of three of my men
and for selling me out?

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.797
25 percent of all cash.
You wil not have to do a thing.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.032
You insult me so before you die?

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.710
Last chance to make me smile.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.112
All right! Half.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:35.032
So!
Now, we can lower our weapons?

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.432
Josif.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.358
You fuck!

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.357
Josif. Stay with me, look at me.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.911
My beautiful brother.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.633
That looks very painful, Viktor.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.674
Here.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.318
Lexi, is Goran.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.552
You stay here.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.233
Sit.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.633
Did he touch you?

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.514
Did he try to have sex with you?

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.678
Then why did you do it?

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.359
Listen to me.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.520
Get out.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.960
Lock the door.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.674
That's right. Come here.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.639
Come here and help me.

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.519
Come help me.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.037
Please help me and I'll do anything for you.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.197
Do you understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.069
I'll do everything for you.
Get me out of here, please.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.712
Please.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.632
Get me out of here.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.080
Get me out of here.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.356
What you're doing?

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.956
What you're doing?

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.112
What you're doing?

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.110
Help. Help me.
I need help out here.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.720
Come out.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.995
Lets get her in.
She's just...

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.557
You're safe now.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.876
You're safe now.
