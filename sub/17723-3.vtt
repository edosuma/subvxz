WEBVTT

00:21.221 --> 00:22.154
Hey, gang!

00:22.156 --> 00:23.689
Whoo, what a morning.

00:23.691 --> 00:27.126
Been down at the stock exchange
since 6:00 a.m.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.861
Oh, did you have a meeting?

00:28.863 --> 00:33.032
No, I was just yelling "buy" and
"sell" until they threw me out.

00:33.034 --> 00:36.035
Where's Warner?

00:36.037 --> 00:37.236
Running late.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.238
He texted me some long message,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.073
I saw the words
"kids" and "diarrhea,"

00:41.075 --> 00:43.976
then I put my phone
in a drawer and walked away.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.046
His kids always have diarrhea.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.048
What is wrong?

00:49.050 --> 00:51.150
I don't know.
When I was a kid,

00:51.152 --> 00:53.152
if you had diarrhea,
you got slapped.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.222
And you learned real quick.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.725
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Hey.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.693
Things were crazy
at the house.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.062
First, the kids...

01:03.064 --> 01:04.063
We know.
You need to slap them. Slap...

01:04.065 --> 01:05.497
...flowing diarrhea,

01:05.499 --> 01:08.067
and then somebody left the
freezer door open all night

01:08.069 --> 01:11.904
and it defrosted
all over the kitchen floor.

01:11.906 --> 01:15.274
Oh, another unsolved
household mystery.

01:15.276 --> 01:19.244
Yeah. I tried to get
Camila to hire some help
around the house,

01:19.246 --> 01:21.447
but she-she thinks
it's a sign of weakness.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.816
Well, you could help.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.718
(both laugh)

01:26.720 --> 01:28.187
You had me, man!

01:28.189 --> 01:29.288
Oh, my God!

01:29.290 --> 01:30.122
That was really funny!

01:30.124 --> 01:32.124
I know. You were, like, "Wha?"

01:32.126 --> 01:36.762
You know, Warner,
we don't need
a housekeeper.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.063
We're all pitching in.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.132
You do nothing.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.100
If you think

01:41.102 --> 01:42.534
Camila needs help,
you could take

01:42.536 --> 01:44.103
my cleaning lady
for the weekend.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.070
Edna? You wouldn't mind?

01:45.072 --> 01:46.638
No. I mean,
we got

01:46.640 --> 01:49.775
an open relationship.
She's free to sweep around.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.979
(phone ringing)

01:57.784 --> 02:00.319
Ghost Child Games.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.121
Customer complaining
that his dragon won't fly.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.388
What game?

02:03.390 --> 02:05.090
<i>Dragonfly.</i>

02:05.092 --> 02:07.092
Just troubleshoot it.

02:07.094 --> 02:10.929
Sure, I'm not doing anything.

02:10.931 --> 02:14.600
Okay, it's down, X, left,
left, Y, left,

02:14.602 --> 02:16.969
start trigger,
right, right,

02:16.971 --> 02:20.472
up, up, and... B.
(sighs)

02:20.474 --> 02:22.341
Thanks for playing.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.511
Oh! I need an intern.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.012
Oh, you're right,
you deserve one.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.014
Let's hire a girl.
I'll do the interviews.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.617
No.
No.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.986
Well, then can we hire
an ugly one with a great body

02:33.988 --> 02:36.054
and we can all just look
where we want?

02:38.358 --> 02:41.493
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:41.495 --> 02:43.362
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:43.364 --> 02:47.499
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:47.501 --> 02:49.601
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:49.603 --> 02:53.772
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:53.774 --> 02:58.210
¶ So many questions have I

02:58.212 --> 03:00.212
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

03:00.214 --> 03:03.415
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.222
Move feet, please.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.456
Move feet, please.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.692
Move feet!

03:15.161 --> 03:18.297
Hey!

03:18.299 --> 03:20.199
(speaks Spanish)

03:20.201 --> 03:22.401
English! English!
English!

03:22.403 --> 03:24.236
Seriously? Again?!

03:24.238 --> 03:26.305
This one's not my fault, Eli.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.406
She's loco!

03:27.408 --> 03:30.209
English! English!
English!

03:30.211 --> 03:33.045
Dad, let Edna do her job.

03:33.047 --> 03:37.216
Oh, sure, take her side,
like always.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.451
This is so unfair!

03:40.587 --> 03:43.655
I made your favorite--
horchata.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.190
Oh, thanks.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.025
Um, Edna, I was wondering,

03:47.027 --> 03:49.228
if instead of coming here
this weekend,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.063
maybe you would clean
Warner's place?

03:51.065 --> 03:55.434
You want me to clean
another man's house?

03:55.436 --> 03:58.070
Well, just for the weekend.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.439
I mean, I told him
how good you are.

04:00.441 --> 04:04.276
You talk to Warner about me?

04:04.278 --> 04:06.712
Well, not, like, details.

04:06.714 --> 04:10.115
Just, you know,
that you're very good,

04:10.117 --> 04:12.451
and we're really happy together.

04:12.453 --> 04:16.688
Okay, I clean him.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.492
I clean him <i>good.</i>

04:27.433 --> 04:31.436
Babe, I got you something.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.438
Edna! Why?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.541
Warner says you need to relax.
You very a-stress.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.143
A little bitchy.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.112
(laughs)

04:40.114 --> 04:41.313
Edna, you're so funny.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.447
Baby, look,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.249
I appreciate this,
I really do.
Zih!

04:44.251 --> 04:45.417
I'm not comfortable...
Zuh!

04:45.419 --> 04:47.452
I'm not comfortable...
Zig-a-uh!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.488
Drink.
Ooh. (chuckles)

04:49.490 --> 04:51.156
Ooh...

04:53.926 --> 04:55.394
That's straight tequila.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.530
(coughs) Whoo!

05:01.467 --> 05:04.569
Stay thirsty, my friend.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.310
Hey, guys, what's going on in
the video game world, huh?

05:11.312 --> 05:12.911
Catch me up.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.514
They're not here.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.520
Ah. Oh, hey,
I brought in your mail.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.689
I sorted it for you.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.357
Here's bills, letters,

05:25.359 --> 05:28.960
and this is new listings of
Christian singles in your area.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.696
Well, thanks, Crawford.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.997
That was really helpful.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.198
Oh, you're welcome.
You're welcome.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.800
Hey, do you have a résumé?

05:34.802 --> 05:37.002
Well, yes.

05:37.004 --> 05:41.373
It's the only thing
in this briefcase.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.543
It says here you worked for
Regional Business User Machines.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.878
Yes, R-BUM we called it.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.216
In fact, our motto was,
"We're in the Yellow Pages.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.518
Look up R-BUM."

05:53.520 --> 05:56.455
Uh, and tell me about some other
places you worked.

05:56.457 --> 06:00.292
Well, I worked for NASA
on the <i>Challenger</i> mission.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.161
Boy, when they say,

06:03.163 --> 06:05.430
"Don't touch that button,"
they mean it.

06:06.799 --> 06:09.568
Well, if you don't mind
being an unpaid intern,

06:09.570 --> 06:11.069
you're hired.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.741
Would you say that again,
please?

06:15.743 --> 06:17.576
You're hired.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.479
I want to call my mom.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.582
Oh, that's sweet. Really?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.384
No, she's way dead.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.821
Mm.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.557
When was the last time
we just relaxed

06:32.559 --> 06:34.593
and watched a movie
together as a couple?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.428
Was it <i>Battleship?</i>

06:37.830 --> 06:41.166
(chuckles)
You were so mad at me.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.236
Having Edna here this weekend
more than makes up for it.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.050
Okay, see you tomorrow.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.519
What?
Tomorrow?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.687
Well-well, hey, we'd
love to have you,

07:02.689 --> 07:04.456
but this-this was just for
the weekend, remember?

07:04.458 --> 07:05.891
Tomorrow you're
back with Eli.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.293
I like your house better.

07:08.295 --> 07:13.231
Oh. Yeah, that's, uh,
well, that's great,

07:13.233 --> 07:15.066
but you work for Eli, remember?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.635
You've been with him for years.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.203
He needs you.

07:18.205 --> 07:22.240
No. You tell him
I work for you now.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.109
Uh, shouldn't <i>you</i> tell him?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.978
No speak English.
See you tomorrow at 3:00.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.886
Break time!

07:34.888 --> 07:36.221
Oh, hey, Dad,

07:36.223 --> 07:37.889
you know, I know
I say this every day,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.624
but what are you doing here?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.426
I'm working.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.196
Didn't Veronica
tell you?
What?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.833
You said I could hire an intern.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.269
Why don't you hire <i>your</i> dad?

07:51.271 --> 07:55.340
Because he's too busy buying
cheap, ill-fitting pants.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.641
ELI: Hey!
Oh, hey!

07:56.643 --> 07:58.443
How was the weekend
with Edna?

07:58.445 --> 08:00.679
Cool. All right, good talk.

08:00.681 --> 08:04.015
Come on. Give me details.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.284
Uh, Eli, you know,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.353
I gotta talk to you
man-to-man.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.590
Where are you
gonna find two men?

08:11.592 --> 08:14.092
I, uh, I think
you should sit down.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.527
Why?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.696
Because I have some bad news,
and you might faint.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.700
What am I, a woman in 1810?
I'm not gonna faint.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.603
Edna's with me now.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.941
What? You...

08:29.943 --> 08:32.177
you stole my maid?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.713
It wasn't planned,
it just happened.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.981
Oh, "it just happened."

08:35.983 --> 08:37.616
It never just happens.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.551
It takes two!

08:39.553 --> 08:41.052
Hey, hey, we're all
consenting adults here.

08:41.054 --> 08:45.190
This kind of thing happens
all the time... in Europe.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.692
Well, last I checked,
we're in San Francisco,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.896
where guys have
each others' backs!

08:50.898 --> 08:54.366
Don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.502
(sighs)
You know what? I'm not mad.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.204
It's... it's all right.

08:59.206 --> 09:03.208
I... I hope you two will
be very happy together.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.378
And you're-you're right.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.647
It's-it's nobody's fault.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.582
This is all your fault!

09:10.584 --> 09:13.752
How dare you blame me!

09:13.754 --> 09:16.388
What are you talking about?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.689
Edna left us.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.758
You pushed her into
Warner and Camila's arms

09:19.760 --> 09:21.526
with your negativity

09:21.528 --> 09:24.996
and your stubbornness
and your general youishness.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.565
I'm not Youish.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.766
Oh, yes, you are!

09:27.768 --> 09:30.535
You are the reason
people hate the Yous!

09:30.537 --> 09:32.837
That's "anti-semantic."

09:34.774 --> 09:37.409
Dad, what are we gonna
do without Edna?

09:37.411 --> 09:39.778
I'm your father.
I'll take care of you.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.780
You've never taken care of me.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.782
Of course I have.
You just don't remember.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.117
That's 'cause you left
when I was five.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.752
How many diapers
did you change?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.688
Who counts?
Mom said none.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.757
So your mom counts.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.759
Dad, you need to
apologize to Edna

09:54.761 --> 09:56.127
and hope she takes us back.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.363
I never apologize to women.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.631
If you do, they'll expect it

09:59.633 --> 10:01.366
every time
you do something wrong.

10:01.368 --> 10:05.704
Wow, you're like evil Yoda.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.771
We don't need Edna.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.240
I can do everything
she does.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.875
Oh, you're gonna
clean the toilets?

10:10.877 --> 10:13.211
Why do you need
to clean a toilet?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.447
Just pee it off.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.651
Well, I restocked the paper
trays and watered the plants.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.252
What else you got?

10:21.254 --> 10:22.954
Ex-boyfriend. Won't accept
end of relationship.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.289
(whispers):
Jason.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.657
Jason.

10:25.659 --> 10:29.661
Jason, it's over. Mm-hmm.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.563
No, she's grown and you haven't.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.399
Oh, come on, Jason,

10:34.401 --> 10:37.102
tears aren't gonna turn
this aircraft carrier around.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.103
(mouths)

10:38.105 --> 10:39.771
Next.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.172
Well, I'm actually headed out
to an animators' conference,

10:41.174 --> 10:42.641
so why don't you just stay

10:42.643 --> 10:44.809
here and help out Warner
for the rest of the day?
Oh.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.910
What?

10:47.079 --> 10:48.680
(sighs)

10:53.452 --> 10:55.320
Uh, what-what
are you doing?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.821
Well, Veronica's gone.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.123
She asked me to shadow you.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.558
Oh.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.265
Hey, uh, Dad, why don't
you go to lunch?

11:07.267 --> 11:10.502
Good idea.
Yeah, okay.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.805
Mmm.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.674
Carrots?
Mm-hmm.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.643
I'm on a diet where you eat
10,000 of these a year.

11:18.645 --> 11:19.678
This is day one.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.480
I got to go to the bathroom.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.349
Great idea.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.218
There-there's only one stall.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.521
I know.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.124
(quietly):
Okay.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.393
Okay.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.905
Dad, this place is disgusting.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.907
And I've been to India.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.875
We've got to get
Edna back.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.544
Will you please
just apologize to her?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.979
What? This is how our place
should look.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.749
We're two young
single guys.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.984
Oh, yeah, and Joan
and Melissa Rivers

11:59.986 --> 12:01.486
are two young single women.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.588
Is there anything
for breakfast?

12:03.590 --> 12:04.589
No.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.924
Scientifically proven

12:05.926 --> 12:07.926
the least important meal
of the day.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.929
You said you'd
take care of me.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.932
I also told your mother
till death do us part.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.401
I think
my pattern's established.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.907
Now, that's
what I call hump day.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.409
(whoops)

12:24.411 --> 12:26.878
Honey, I heard you
the first time.
Oh.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.879
I wasn't sure if you did.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.181
What is she doing?
Oh.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.950
Eli told me about this.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.786
She-she actually makes her own
lemon cleaner from scratch.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.923
More bleach.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.725
Honey, honey.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.193
Look at the laundry.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.862
It's folded.

12:45.397 --> 12:46.931
Oh, my God!

12:46.933 --> 12:49.868
(both moan)

12:49.870 --> 12:52.804
I bet you this is
what God smells like.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.639
Edna, what did you put
in this detergent?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.775
It smells fantastic.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.610
Cinnamon, brown sugar

12:58.612 --> 13:00.245
and holy water.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.447
It's amazing.
You're amazing.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.149
(phone dings)
(giggles)

13:04.151 --> 13:05.750
What's so funny?

13:05.752 --> 13:07.385
Nothing, it's text.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.554
Oh, oh, that's pretty funny.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.122
Who-who's texting you
at this hour?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.257
It's Eli.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.992
He text me picture
of his junk.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.960
What?!

13:15.962 --> 13:17.962
See? Look, his apartment

13:17.964 --> 13:20.899
covered with junk.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.901
Hey, uh, why did you run
over here so fast?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.903
Why did you?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.008
ELI:
Dad!

13:30.010 --> 13:31.142
Yeah?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.579
Where's the
toilet paper?

13:34.581 --> 13:36.247
Gone.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.651
I thought we agreed to
four squares a day?

13:41.987 --> 13:45.423
I had a 22-square
disaster earlier.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.493
Use the cardboard tube.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.863
It's gone!

13:53.833 --> 13:57.335
I can slip your diploma
under the door.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.105
Do it.

14:17.456 --> 14:21.059
Well, the place is clean.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.062
Yeah, I'm-I'm glad

14:24.064 --> 14:27.031
you ordered a maid,
I guess.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.900
Yeah, but when you
order a maid,

14:28.902 --> 14:31.636
you make certain...
assumptions.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.304
Fresh undies, guys.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.507
Get them while they're hot.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.976
Who's the briefs man?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.077
Me.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.646
Wow, vintage '87
tighty-whities.

14:41.648 --> 14:45.483
You don't see
a lot of these anymore.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.719
Okay, last load.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.757
Come on, arms up.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.533
What about you, D-man?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.602
Let's go, arms up.

15:06.872 --> 15:09.073
Keep moving, weirdo.

15:14.380 --> 15:18.082
Boy, you really blew it
when you got rid of Edna.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.385
Me?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.120
Edna left because of you.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.688
Me? What I do?

15:23.690 --> 15:24.756
Well, she's been working here

15:24.758 --> 15:26.090
for six years without a problem.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.926
You're here three weeks
and she's gone.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.093
You have ruined

15:29.095 --> 15:31.129
the longest, most successful
relationship

15:31.131 --> 15:33.665
I've ever had with a woman.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.568
We are talking
about a housekeeper, right?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.037
Well, Edna's
more than that to me.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.471
She's like a mother
and a friend

15:40.473 --> 15:43.441
and a Mexican laborer
all wrapped into one.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.411
Hey, guys.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.279
As long as my stuff's
in the wash,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.815
you mind if I grab
a quick "showw"?

15:53.152 --> 15:55.420
All righty,
I moved your car.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.288
God, that thing is dented.
Yeah.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.224
Everyone else on the road
is a really bad driver.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.060
Listen, Crawford,

16:02.062 --> 16:04.562
I'm really sorry, but we're
gonna have to let you go.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.997
What?

16:05.999 --> 16:07.131
Why?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.133
Well, legal sent this memo over.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.502
You can't be an unpaid intern
unless you're in college.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.671
Oh, rats.

16:15.507 --> 16:16.641
All this damn red tape.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.677
It's-it's ruining this country.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.881
Well, it's not the first
time I've been fired.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.990
All right, gang, I...

16:31.992 --> 16:34.325
I guess this
is good-bye.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.627
Unless, somebody's got

16:36.629 --> 16:38.096
a good-bye cake?

16:40.532 --> 16:42.166
No.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.468
Okay.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.603
Wait a minute, Dad?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.239
(groaning loudly)

16:49.675 --> 16:53.211
How would you like a paid
position at this company?

16:53.213 --> 16:55.213
Really?

16:55.215 --> 16:58.282
Well, what kind of money
we talking?

16:58.284 --> 17:01.352
Uh, $200 a week,
which will be applied

17:01.354 --> 17:04.188
to your $200 a week
room and board.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.191
$205.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.227
Nope.
Deal.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.295
Hey.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.531
(doorbell rings)

17:15.667 --> 17:18.302
Eli?

17:19.405 --> 17:22.507
I want to hear you say it
to my face.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.576
Are you happier with Warner and
Camila than you were with me?

17:25.578 --> 17:27.378
<i>Sí.</i>

17:28.647 --> 17:30.048
But we had plans.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.716
I was gonna rent a beach house
for the summer

17:31.718 --> 17:34.252
and you were gonna clean it.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.855
The lady's made
her choice, bub.

17:37.857 --> 17:41.392
Hey, the lady can speak
for herself, Mac.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.327
Okay, okay, okay, come on, guys.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.263
Remember the last time
you got in a fight,

17:45.265 --> 17:47.532
the nurse said she'd never
seen so many scratches.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.434
So, baby, you go over there.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.036
Eli, we can help you find
another Edna.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.738
Okay?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.406
I don't want another Edna.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.941
I want Edna.

17:56.943 --> 18:00.178
If Edna is what my boy wants,
Edna he shall have.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.081
I'd like to read
from a prepared statement,

18:03.083 --> 18:04.849
if I may.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.185
"I'm very, very sorry

18:07.187 --> 18:08.853
"for the following reasons:

18:08.855 --> 18:12.090
"Potato chips in sofa.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.526
"Wet towels on floor.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.129
"Green card jokes.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.032
"Large family jokes.

18:22.201 --> 18:25.369
Everything I said about beans."

18:26.472 --> 18:27.738
So?

18:27.740 --> 18:30.007
(shouting in Spanish)

18:35.080 --> 18:36.547
What did she say?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.549
Uh, no.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.452
Dad, how did you even get here?

18:41.454 --> 18:44.021
Guys, it is hot out.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.925
Wait a minute,
who the hell are you?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.794
Oh, this is our new maid,
Joshua.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.662
You can call me 'Shua.

18:51.664 --> 18:55.466
Uh, no, I'm sorry,
I can't do that.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.335
Hey, David, text me
when you want to jet.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.171
I'm just gonna
roller-B around the block.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.109
You have new maid already?

19:05.111 --> 19:07.145
Oh yeah, 'Sh...

19:07.147 --> 19:09.413
'Shua's terrific.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.517
This what you want now?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.819
White maid?

19:15.587 --> 19:17.955
Well, I'd rather have you.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.191
Edna?

19:20.193 --> 19:22.960
When I'm sick,
who takes care of me?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.162
Edna do.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.630
Yes.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.298
And you remember when I got
hurt playing basketball?

19:27.300 --> 19:30.334
Who carried me 12 blocks
to the emergency room?

19:30.336 --> 19:33.437
Edna.
Yes.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.206
Come home, Edna.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.542
My heart, my refrigerator

19:37.544 --> 19:39.644
is empty without you.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.213
Oh, Eli.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.781
Be strong, Edna.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.017
We got a good thing
going here, okay?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.552
(chuckles)

19:47.554 --> 19:51.289
I wish I could clean
for everyone, but...

19:51.291 --> 19:52.957
I go back with Eli.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.225
(gasps)

19:54.227 --> 19:55.459
(wheezing): Yes.

19:58.163 --> 20:01.065
Warner, you have family,
beautiful kids.

20:01.067 --> 20:04.368
Eli have <i>nada.</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.870
He has me.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.038
<i>Nada.</i>

20:08.340 --> 20:10.708
Oh, Edna.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.917
Be <i>good.</i>

20:24.256 --> 20:27.325
Eli, come to Edna.

20:50.515 --> 20:53.985
So we're cool, right?

20:54.786 --> 20:57.688
Yeah, we're cool.

21:00.225 --> 21:04.295
Does she, uh,
ever mention my name?

21:07.899 --> 21:09.867
No.
Okay.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.938
Can I smell your shirt?

21:33.558 --> 21:34.925
Guys, we have
a 3:00 meeting.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.994
Push it back!
