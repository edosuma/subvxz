18:35.083 --> 18:37.208
All right.
I'm sorry I opened my big mouth.

18:37.791 --> 18:40.041
It's just... She's quite fit.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.041
So what?

18:42.125 --> 18:44.666
[chuckles] Okay. Whatever you say.

18:58.541 --> 19:00.666
[music becomes muffled and fades out]

19:12.875 --> 19:14.125
Almost there.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.583
Then, it's not bad.

19:30.208 --> 19:31.333
And finally, fixer.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.583
This one is good, too.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.458
I like this mark here.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.000
My scar?

19:43.083 --> 19:44.000
Yes.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.541
So beautiful.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.750
[Natsuko]
So, how's it going with the guy you met?

20:01.833 --> 20:02.708
Fine.

20:04.125 --> 20:06.708
Does he have a soy sauce face
or a ketchup face?

20:06.791 --> 20:08.416
-What?
-[laughs]

20:08.500 --> 20:10.625
That's the way we talk about
whether a Japanese person

20:10.708 --> 20:12.541
looks Eastern or Western.

20:14.833 --> 20:18.083
More soy, I suppose.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.166
[both laugh]

20:20.250 --> 20:21.458
So...

20:23.291 --> 20:24.458
how's everything?

20:24.958 --> 20:26.875
-What do you mean?
-You know?

20:28.583 --> 20:31.333
-In the bedroom?
-We haven't done anything yet.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.125
Really?

20:33.583 --> 20:35.875
-Taking it slow?
-It's not up to me.

[camera shutter clicks]

21:02.583 --> 21:03.458
Perfect.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.583
I need to change film.

21:30.708 --> 21:31.833
What are you doing?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.708
[in Japanese] I didn't ask you to do that.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.083
-[Lucy in English] It's very tight.
-Yes.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.791
It's a <i>furisode.</i>
They’re worn on happy occasions.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.625
It's for unmarried women, right?

22:16.666 --> 22:18.833
It's for young unmarried women.

22:20.875 --> 22:21.833
Okay.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.375
There, finished.

22:23.458 --> 22:24.375
Look.

22:25.416 --> 22:26.291
[chuckles]

22:26.708 --> 22:27.875
So pretty.

22:27.958 --> 22:28.833
[both laugh]

22:28.916 --> 22:31.125
It’s not so easy
for single women in Japan.

22:32.583 --> 22:33.958
No, it's hard.

22:35.666 --> 22:37.333
Have you ever thought of getting married?

22:39.583 --> 22:40.458
No.

22:41.541 --> 22:42.666
Because of my job.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.791
You know, I'm a magistrate.

22:45.916 --> 22:48.500
It’s a little intimidating for most men.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.666
And besides, I’m too old now.

22:52.333 --> 22:53.541
You're still young.

22:53.625 --> 22:54.500
Mm.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.833
Not in the eyes of Japanese men.

22:58.916 --> 23:00.666
Maybe I could get a widower.

23:01.333 --> 23:04.541
[laughs] Or an old one
with medical problems.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
But I don’t know how I'd find the time.

23:09.208 --> 23:10.083
Right.

23:10.791 --> 23:13.416
I have my job, my friends,

23:13.500 --> 23:14.958
the string quartet.

23:16.958 --> 23:19.916
It’s a lot to give up
to wash some old man’s diapers.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.125
-That must be Yamamoto-san.
-Hm.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.083
I’ll go and help her with the cakes.

25:02.208 --> 25:03.125
[in Japanese] Tell me.

25:03.208 --> 25:04.708
[in English] Yamamoto-san died today.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.583
She fell down the stairs
when I greeted her.

25:09.666 --> 25:11.125
She broke her neck.

25:16.625 --> 25:19.000
Death follows me. It always has.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.166
-I understand.
-No, you don't.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.375
You don't understand half of it.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.291
You will tell me, in time.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.875
And I will tell you things about me.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.875
The first time we saw each other,

25:35.291 --> 25:36.958
I knew we could be truthful.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.500
I knew it.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.583
Let me show you something.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.791
My aunt, she brought me up.

26:13.083 --> 26:16.541
After she died, I left Kagoshima
and came to Tokyo.

26:33.666 --> 26:34.791
She's beautiful.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.916
[Teiji]
We live in the atmosphere of death.

26:49.583 --> 26:50.875
But we are alive.

<i>Do you know someone called Teiji Matsuda?</i>

28:16.666 --> 28:18.583
I do, yes.

28:19.583 --> 28:23.166
Did Lily Bridges know him?

28:24.125 --> 28:25.000
Yes.

28:25.958 --> 28:27.708
When did you first meet him?

28:28.166 --> 28:29.541
May 3rd.

28:31.541 --> 28:33.416
You seem very certain of that.

28:34.083 --> 28:35.666
That was the date.

28:36.833 --> 28:38.125
Was he...

28:39.000 --> 28:40.416
your boyfriend?

28:44.041 --> 28:45.541
-For a time.
-[Oguchi laughs]

28:45.625 --> 28:47.541
Why didn't you say that
when I asked before?

28:48.458 --> 28:49.916
He asked in the wrong tense.

28:50.541 --> 28:52.333
[Oguchi] This is a murder investigation.

28:52.416 --> 28:53.791
You understand?

28:54.916 --> 28:57.166
And we strongly suspect
it was someone who knew her.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.750
This is a very serious matter.

28:59.375 --> 29:00.958
Why are you so unhelpful?

29:03.125 --> 29:05.083
You are not like Japanese women.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.083
Yes, I am.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.708
[Oguchi scoffs]

29:17.583 --> 29:20.000
[in English] I don't understand how
anyone finds anything

29:20.083 --> 29:21.666
if none of the streets have names.

29:22.583 --> 29:24.958
I guess I'm just gonna
have to learn numbers.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.458
-[in Japanese] Good morning.
-Good morning.

29:28.541 --> 29:29.875
[continues in Japanese]

29:29.958 --> 29:31.125
[in English] Thank you.

29:32.166 --> 29:36.083
Oh, I love this one! It's so Japanese.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.708
I think I had a dream
about a place like this,

29:38.791 --> 29:40.625
but in my dream it was a tree house.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.333
It's perfect.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.708
-The kitchen’s small.
-I don't cook.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.625
How did I know that?

29:50.125 --> 29:52.833
Well, I guess the only real downside
is that it's an old building,

29:52.916 --> 29:55.500
so in case of an earthquake...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.166
I don't care.
I mean, it's lasted this long.

29:58.791 --> 29:59.666
True.

30:00.083 --> 30:01.500
Let's put in an application.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.000
Okay.

30:03.083 --> 30:04.333
Will you tell her for me?

30:06.166 --> 30:07.041
Of course.

30:11.041 --> 30:12.000
[Lily] Look.

30:18.916 --> 30:21.791
[Lily] It's weird how everyone
stares at you in Japan.

30:21.875 --> 30:23.125
It's like being famous.

30:23.791 --> 30:25.750
[Lucy]
Yes. Some people get addicted to that.

30:25.833 --> 30:26.958
Like Bob?

30:27.541 --> 30:28.541
Like Bob.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.375
He's kind of sexy, though, isn't he?

30:31.458 --> 30:34.250
I don't see him that way. Nope.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.000
Do you have a boyfriend?

30:37.458 --> 30:38.375
I do.

30:39.666 --> 30:40.666
What's his name?

30:42.666 --> 30:44.000
His name is Teiji.

30:46.041 --> 30:47.083
Teiji.

30:49.541 --> 30:51.041
This looks good, the contract.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.000
Um...

30:52.083 --> 30:55.000
I can ask one of the lawyers at Sasagawa
to double-check it.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.750
Thanks. I'm so impressed
you can even read that.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.291
[waitress in Japanese]
I can take your order if you're ready.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.000
[in English] Will you order me a coffee?

31:03.875 --> 31:05.541
-[in Japanese] Just a moment, please.
-Okay.

31:06.750 --> 31:09.083
[in English]
You have to be able to order for yourself.

31:09.166 --> 31:12.291
How are you gonna survive
if you can't ask for anything?

31:13.166 --> 31:14.041
I don't know.

31:15.416 --> 31:18.875
If you want a coffee, you say,
<i>"Koohii o hitotsu,"</i>

31:18.958 --> 31:21.333
which means one,
<i>"kudasai," </i>which means please.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.375
[in Japanese] <i>Koohii o...</i>

31:23.458 --> 31:25.750
<i>-hitotsu...</i>
<i>-Hitotsu kudasai.</i>

31:26.416 --> 31:27.375
<i>Kudasai.</i>

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
[in English] That's it.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.166
-[in Japanese] Excuse me.
-Yes.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.833
<i>Koohii o hitotsu kudasai.</i>

31:35.333 --> 31:36.625
What would you like?

31:37.500 --> 31:39.875
<i>Koohii o hitotsu kudasai.</i>

31:40.458 --> 31:41.333
Okay.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.000
-Me too.
-Okay.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.541
[in English]
That's crazy that she understood that.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.375
[both laugh]

32:09.000 --> 32:10.958
[indistinct chatter]

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
[in Japanese] Look.

32:30.958 --> 32:33.833
The light, the shadow,
everything exactly right.

32:33.916 --> 32:34.916
Hm.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.291
[in English]
When did you start photography?

32:42.458 --> 32:43.750
[in Japanese] At school.

32:46.708 --> 32:48.166
I was always in the darkroom.

32:50.291 --> 32:53.166
There was an old teacher,
Mr. Hyakutake, who taught me.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.458
There were about a dozen people
in the photography club,

32:57.541 --> 32:59.875
but eventually, they all left,
and there was only me.

33:01.083 --> 33:03.000
[in English] I read once that when...

33:03.083 --> 33:05.833
the Westerners arrived
in 19th century Japan,

33:05.916 --> 33:08.500
they wanted to photograph
the locals, but...

33:09.375 --> 33:10.583
they wouldn’t let them.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.041
They thought it would steal their soul.

33:14.541 --> 33:15.833
[in Japanese] I understand that.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.166
The subject always gives something,

33:18.250 --> 33:20.458
some part of themselves,
to the photographer.

33:23.958 --> 33:28.291
If every time I took a photo
it took a piece of your soul...

33:30.208 --> 33:31.791
would you still let me?

33:36.208 --> 33:38.416
[in English] I think you know the answer
to that question.

33:41.375 --> 33:42.458
[chuckles]

33:45.583 --> 33:47.000
[in Japanese] I will put these away.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.333
[in English] You gonna lock them away?

33:50.416 --> 33:51.291
Yes.

33:51.375 --> 33:52.958
What else do you have in there?

34:00.333 --> 34:02.083
[sound of key opening lock]

34:10.416 --> 34:13.583
[Bob] Didn't Teiji wanna come today?
I've gotta meet him one of these days.

34:13.666 --> 34:15.500
-[Lucy] You will.
-You two getting on well?

34:15.583 --> 34:17.166
[Lucy] Yeah. Great.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.125
[Bob] Tell me more.

34:19.208 --> 34:23.041
[Lucy] Well, I guess we're both a bit odd,
but we fit well together.

34:23.708 --> 34:25.458
[Bob] Sounds kinky. [laughs]

34:25.541 --> 34:26.458
[Lucy] Shut up.

34:26.541 --> 34:28.833
Oh, so the band's playing
another gig next week.

34:28.916 --> 34:30.458
At the Downbeat Club in Ikebukuro.

34:30.541 --> 34:32.291
-That's good.
-Yeah.

34:32.375 --> 34:33.583
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

34:34.791 --> 34:37.291
Yeah, these musicians,
they are the best I've ever played with.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.625
I used to have a couple of bands
back in England,

34:39.708 --> 34:41.541
but, you know,
there's so much negativity there.

34:41.625 --> 34:42.583
Yeah.

34:43.791 --> 34:46.250
I think that's what I like most
about Japan.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.833
It gives you a second chance.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.625
[Bob] Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.125
Wow!

34:55.208 --> 34:57.666
-[Lucy] It's so beautiful.
-[Natsuko] Stunning.

34:58.625 --> 34:59.833
[Lucy] I love Japan.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.958
-[Bob] Did anyone bring a camera?
-[Natsuko] Not me.

35:03.041 --> 35:04.041
-[Lucy] Not me.
-[Lily] No.

35:06.166 --> 35:09.625
-[Lucy] What about... "good morning"?
-[Lily] <i>Ohayo gozaimasu.</i>

35:09.708 --> 35:10.875
[Lucy] And then...

35:11.458 --> 35:12.666
"How are you?"

35:12.750 --> 35:14.333
[Lily] <i>Gen-ji?</i>

35:14.791 --> 35:17.291
<i>Gen-ki... desu-ka.</i>

35:17.750 --> 35:21.125
Uh... And then if you meet someone
for the first time, you just say,

35:21.750 --> 35:24.833
<i>-"Yoroshiku onegaishimasu."</i>
-Oh, my God.

35:24.916 --> 35:26.500
-Just... Ah!
-Oh, shit.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.000
-Oh!
-Okay, sit down.

35:29.083 --> 35:29.958
No, no, I'm--

35:30.041 --> 35:30.958
-Sit down.
-Ah!

35:31.916 --> 35:32.833
Ah!

35:34.458 --> 35:35.625
[grunts]

35:36.958 --> 35:39.000
-I'm gonna take your shoe off.
-What?

35:40.791 --> 35:42.458
-Does this hurt?
-[grunts]

35:43.125 --> 35:44.125
Push on my hand.

35:44.833 --> 35:45.833
[grunts]

35:46.750 --> 35:48.208
It's not broken. Probably sprained.

35:48.291 --> 35:49.166
[Bob] What happened?

35:49.250 --> 35:53.041
[grunts]
I fell on this, and Lily's playing nurse.

35:53.125 --> 35:55.375
I'm not playing. I used to work
at George Washington Hospital.

35:55.458 --> 35:56.458
I am a nurse.

35:56.541 --> 35:57.750
[scoffs] Really?

35:58.291 --> 36:00.166
Yeah, I wasn't always a bartender.

36:26.291 --> 36:29.041
-[Bob] Why don't you come in here?
-[Lily] I'm going to go in with Lucy.

36:30.208 --> 36:31.541
Maybe later, though.

36:48.583 --> 36:49.791
[Lily] How's your ankle?

36:51.875 --> 36:52.833
It's better.

37:02.208 --> 37:03.958
You think Teiji would like it here?

37:04.666 --> 37:05.875
Yeah, I think so.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.375
He loves the water and...

37:08.125 --> 37:10.291
reflections.
He would photograph everything.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.416
I love taking photographs,
but I'm not very good.

37:16.833 --> 37:19.375
-Does he sell his pictures?
-I don't think so.

37:21.625 --> 37:22.958
But... I don't know.

37:24.250 --> 37:25.875
Well, what does he do with them?

37:27.125 --> 37:28.375
I'm not sure.

37:28.458 --> 37:29.458
[chuckles]

37:31.291 --> 37:32.666
I wish I could meet him.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.333
Why don't you and I go down
to the noodle shop one night?

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
-I don't know.
-Come on, it'll be fun.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.208
[laughs]

37:49.250 --> 37:50.416
Yeah, sure.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.916
Teiji, I was wondering...

38:06.083 --> 38:08.250
why don't you do something
with your photographs?

38:10.041 --> 38:13.166
I mean, not the ones of me,
of course, but...

38:13.875 --> 38:15.875
the ones of the city. They're really good.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.875
-[Teiji] I don't want to.
-Really?

38:20.250 --> 38:21.166
I mean...

38:21.916 --> 38:24.333
-why are you taking them?
-I'm collecting them.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.041
For what?

38:27.291 --> 38:28.375
My collection.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.250
You can have an exhibition.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.875
Or put them in a book,
let people see them.

38:36.958 --> 38:38.750
Why does it matter to you so much?

38:39.916 --> 38:40.875
I'm sorry.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.083
[in Japanese] I've got to go to work.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.541
[distant chatter and laughter]

39:14.250 --> 39:16.208
[in Japanese] Will I see you this weekend?

39:16.291 --> 39:17.375
I have to work.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.750
-Um... Yes, but...
-I will call you.

39:22.000 --> 39:22.958
[in English] Okay.

39:24.041 --> 39:25.041
Bye.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.083
[cabinet rattles]

[door rattles]

42:32.708 --> 42:34.041
[exhales]

42:34.458 --> 42:35.375
What are you doing?

42:36.541 --> 42:37.583
I'm sorry.

42:40.833 --> 42:41.875
They are private.

42:42.875 --> 42:44.166
Are you spying on me?

42:44.750 --> 42:46.125
Why did you do this?

42:55.125 --> 42:56.041
Who is she?

42:56.125 --> 42:58.041
[key rattles in lock]

43:00.916 --> 43:02.250
Her name is Sachi.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.166
Were you together?

43:06.708 --> 43:08.750
Yes. I must get back to work.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.708
Where is she now?

43:13.208 --> 43:14.875
I don't know. She's gone.

43:16.541 --> 43:17.583
Just "gone?"

43:19.166 --> 43:22.666
[in Japanese] We finished.
She left. I didn’t try to find her.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.833
When I found you,
I stopped thinking of Sachi.

43:25.916 --> 43:29.750
I'm sorry. Please forget I ever did this.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.833
-I have to get back.
-Hold me.

43:37.375 --> 43:38.916
[in English] I shouldn't have done that.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.500
It's just that I think about you
all the time, every moment.

43:41.958 --> 43:45.375
-I wanted to know more about you.
-That's not the way to find out.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.166
I know.

43:48.166 --> 43:49.375
You must trust me.

43:51.083 --> 43:51.958
I will.

44:03.208 --> 44:04.208
[camera shutter clicks]

44:06.541 --> 44:07.458
[camera shutter clicks]

44:10.833 --> 44:12.750

[camera shutter clicks]

44:20.958 --> 44:22.041
[camera shutter clicks]

44:29.666 --> 44:33.333
I just got a letter from my mom,
and it took eight days to get here.

44:33.833 --> 44:34.708
I know.

44:35.583 --> 44:37.291
That's fast, actually.

44:38.625 --> 44:39.875
And the phones!

44:40.500 --> 44:42.833
I called my girlfriend
and we talked for, like, 20 minutes.

44:42.916 --> 44:44.791
And it cost over a hundred bucks.

44:46.125 --> 44:47.750
I find it better not to call.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.291
I like being cut off.

44:51.791 --> 44:52.666
It's great.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.208
Do you miss your family?

44:56.666 --> 44:57.541
Nope.

45:00.125 --> 45:01.208
How are the noodles?

45:02.375 --> 45:04.125
-Awesome.
-Delicious.

45:04.875 --> 45:06.375
I'm finishing work soon.

45:06.916 --> 45:08.250
Do you wanna go somewhere?

45:09.625 --> 45:12.791
It's getting late.
I think Lily wants to go home.

45:12.875 --> 45:14.666
Are you kidding? I'd love to.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.625
[Lily] Can we go?

45:18.166 --> 45:19.125
Please?

45:24.791 --> 45:25.666
Sure.

45:25.750 --> 45:27.375
-[Lily] Awesome.
-Yeah.

45:27.833 --> 45:28.750
Good.

45:33.458 --> 45:35.666
Oh, my God. He's so cute!

45:36.250 --> 45:37.208
Cute?

45:37.833 --> 45:40.458
He's not cute. Kittens are cute.

45:40.541 --> 45:42.958
Okay, whatever, he's gorgeous.
And he's so tall.

45:43.041 --> 45:45.041
I thought Japanese guys
were supposed to be short.

45:45.791 --> 45:48.916
That's bullshit. That's just a stereotype.

46:18.833 --> 46:20.166
[camera shutter clicks]

46:25.208 --> 46:26.375

[distant horn blares, birds sing]

46:48.750 --> 46:50.458
[doorbell rings]

46:55.333 --> 46:57.291
[Lily] Hey! I was just in the area.

46:57.375 --> 46:59.791
-Hey!
-I don't wanna bother you if Teiji's here.

47:01.291 --> 47:03.166
-He doesn't come here.
-I brought whiskey.

47:03.875 --> 47:05.750
Your house is so nice.

47:06.291 --> 47:08.166
It's so much nicer than mine.

47:08.583 --> 47:11.166
-No tree, though.
-No, no tree.

47:13.041 --> 47:15.541
You don't have any pictures
of Teiji anywhere.

47:15.625 --> 47:17.791
He doesn't like having his picture taken.

47:17.875 --> 47:20.041
It was really great meeting him
the other night.

47:20.875 --> 47:22.500
He's, like, obsessed with you.

47:23.541 --> 47:26.250
-Why do you say that?
-'Cause I can tell. I know men.

47:28.333 --> 47:29.333
[soft chuckle]

47:30.291 --> 47:31.583
What star sign are you?

47:33.291 --> 47:34.875
I don't believe in all of that.

47:35.541 --> 47:36.500
Why?

47:37.750 --> 47:41.416
My personality is a combination
of my genes,

47:41.500 --> 47:45.000
my upbringing, my parents, my school.
Nothing to do with the stars.

47:46.208 --> 47:47.083
Hm...

47:48.666 --> 47:49.583
Taurus?

47:52.666 --> 47:54.000
You came to my birthday.

47:54.083 --> 47:55.291
[both laugh]

47:57.041 --> 47:58.708
Yeah, but I can also just tell.

47:59.666 --> 48:00.958
I can read palms, too.

48:02.583 --> 48:03.833
And tarot cards.

48:06.041 --> 48:07.041
Really?

48:07.125 --> 48:09.708
Sometimes, at the bar, I have to be
careful when I'm getting people's change

48:09.791 --> 48:12.208
not to look at their hands
'cause I see things.

48:13.875 --> 48:15.000
Right.

48:15.083 --> 48:16.125
I do, for real.

48:21.958 --> 48:23.583
Go on, then. [clears throat]

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
In the past, there's like a...

48:35.916 --> 48:37.458
emptiness or, like, a...

48:38.083 --> 48:39.250
silence.

48:39.916 --> 48:42.375
And then you have
these three breaks in the line.

48:44.541 --> 48:47.208
There's one early on,
then another, and then a third.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.166
What do they mean?

48:54.208 --> 48:55.458
[Lily] Hm.

48:55.541 --> 48:56.833
Abrupt change.

48:57.666 --> 48:58.833
Accidents.

49:00.875 --> 49:01.875
Death.

49:08.708 --> 49:09.583
What else?

49:12.708 --> 49:14.416
What do you see about the future?

49:18.458 --> 49:19.625
You mean, like, Teiji?

49:20.625 --> 49:21.583
Mm-hm.

49:26.833 --> 49:28.708
It's really complicated. I can't read it.

49:32.916 --> 49:33.833
Come on.

49:34.791 --> 49:35.708
Sorry.

49:36.708 --> 49:38.416
You clearly reacted to something.

49:39.041 --> 49:42.041
[sighs] Well, it's like a window that
opens up and then I can see things.

49:42.125 --> 49:45.333
And then it fogs up and then
I can't really be sure of anything.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.500
-I didn't mean to freak you out.
-I'm not freaked out.

49:55.208 --> 49:56.583
-Want some whiskey?
-Mm-hm.

49:59.375 --> 50:00.250
Definitely.

50:08.333 --> 50:10.291
[rumbling]

50:23.583 --> 50:25.041
[rumbling stops]

50:25.666 --> 50:27.291
-You okay?
-I think so.

50:27.375 --> 50:29.000
[rumbling begins again]

50:30.500 --> 50:32.000
-[rumbling stops]
-[sighs]

50:32.666 --> 50:33.708
[exhales]

50:35.750 --> 50:37.875
-I think it stopped.
-Yeah, I think it did.

50:40.791 --> 50:42.625
[bird sings]

50:43.291 --> 50:44.416
Do you hear that?

50:46.500 --> 50:47.625
I'm not sure.

50:54.708 --> 50:56.083
It's the earthquake bird.

50:59.208 --> 51:00.708
It's what Teiji calls it.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.833
Always sings after an earthquake.

51:04.916 --> 51:07.458
[bird still singing]

51:07.541 --> 51:08.541
Oh, yeah.

51:10.958 --> 51:12.000
I hear it.

51:15.458 --> 51:16.500
It's beautiful.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.208
Let's go back to sleep.

51:25.916 --> 51:27.125
[light switch clicks]

[gasps softly]

51:48.666 --> 51:50.458
[music plays quietly on radio]

51:53.958 --> 51:55.125
I don't need tea.

51:56.833 --> 51:58.625
Just trying to wake myself up.

51:59.041 --> 52:00.916
I had a great night's sleep.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.416
Except for the earthquake.

52:03.000 --> 52:03.875
Really?

52:04.791 --> 52:06.958
Couldn't have been a big one.
I must've slept through it.

52:10.958 --> 52:12.458
No, we were both awake.

52:13.291 --> 52:14.208
Weird.

52:14.875 --> 52:15.916
I don't remember.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.041
It looks like it's going to rain.
Can I borrow a coat?

52:24.250 --> 52:25.125
Sure.

52:26.125 --> 52:27.000
It's in there.

52:27.458 --> 52:28.375
The closet.

52:33.958 --> 52:36.916
I was wondering, do you want to go
to Sado Island with me?

52:37.625 --> 52:40.375
Katoh-san, my friend,
she's in the string quartet.

52:40.458 --> 52:44.291
She's from there, and she says
it's like time traveling into the past.

52:44.750 --> 52:45.625
When?

52:47.416 --> 52:48.833
The weekend after next.

52:50.041 --> 52:52.208
It's an arts and culture festival--

52:52.291 --> 52:53.916
Won't you be going with Teiji?

52:55.875 --> 52:58.166
If he can get off work, yes.

52:58.250 --> 53:01.708
I have to think about it, because Bob
invited me to some concert that he's--

53:01.791 --> 53:02.750
Not that one.

53:03.916 --> 53:05.458
Oh. Sorry.

53:06.125 --> 53:07.166
No, take it.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.250
I just need it back.

53:10.666 --> 53:11.583
Okay.

53:12.333 --> 53:14.250
Thank you. I'll take care of it.

53:22.250 --> 53:23.333

-Teiji...

53:33.375 --> 53:35.291
let's not take any more photos today.

53:36.125 --> 53:37.000
Why?

53:37.958 --> 53:39.000
I'm tired of it.

53:41.833 --> 53:44.333
-Okay.
-No, I mean, we could take some more.

53:47.625 --> 53:49.083
-I'm sorry.
-No.

53:50.125 --> 53:51.500
Not when you don't want to.

53:54.666 --> 53:56.583
[Teiji pours drink]

53:58.708 --> 54:01.291
Did you used to go out
in Shinjuku with Sachi?

54:03.333 --> 54:04.416
Sometimes.

54:05.000 --> 54:05.958
Why do you ask?

54:07.875 --> 54:11.041
Natsuko, the girl I work with,
she has a sister who's in a band,

54:11.125 --> 54:13.083
and they're gonna play
at this club tomorrow night.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.541
Do you want to go?

54:15.125 --> 54:16.916
Well, we never go out. We could.

54:17.916 --> 54:19.125
You know, have fun.

54:24.125 --> 54:27.541
Bob is gonna be there,
and... Lily, I think.

54:31.583 --> 54:33.041
Okay, let's go.

-[camera shutter clicks]

1:17:02.541 --> 1:17:03.916
[in Japanese] I did it.

1:17:06.583 --> 1:17:09.208
I killed Lily Bridges.

1:17:13.916 --> 1:17:14.875
How did you kill her?

1:17:17.375 --> 1:17:18.583
Tell me! How did you kill her?

1:17:19.666 --> 1:17:21.000
I smashed her head in.

1:17:21.875 --> 1:17:22.875
With what?

1:17:25.208 --> 1:17:26.166
A brick.

1:17:30.125 --> 1:17:33.041
It is good you are talking now.

1:17:34.041 --> 1:17:35.333
Tell me why you did it.

1:17:35.791 --> 1:17:39.291
It's best to give us
as much information as possible.

1:17:40.125 --> 1:17:41.458
Best for you, I'm sure.

1:17:43.750 --> 1:17:45.291
All you need to know is

1:17:45.791 --> 1:17:47.666
I am guilty.

1:17:51.375 --> 1:17:52.541

1:18:12.416 --> 1:18:13.750

1:18:48.375 --> 1:18:49.875
Lucy, what's going on?

1:18:50.625 --> 1:18:53.125
-Are you sick?
-I'm not feeling very well.

1:18:55.125 --> 1:18:56.583
I'll be fine in a day or two.

1:18:57.291 --> 1:18:58.416
I brought these.

1:19:04.958 --> 1:19:07.125
Is there something you need to talk about?

1:19:07.625 --> 1:19:08.583
No.

1:19:12.375 --> 1:19:14.291
Well, what should I tell them at work?

1:19:14.958 --> 1:19:17.458
You can tell them anything. I'm quitting.

1:19:18.208 --> 1:19:19.208
Quitting?

1:19:19.708 --> 1:19:21.458
Lucy, what are you talking about?

1:19:23.375 --> 1:19:24.500
Leave me, Natsuko.

1:19:25.250 --> 1:19:26.125
I'm worried about you.

1:19:26.208 --> 1:19:27.708
Just leave me, Natsuko!

1:20:25.875 --> 1:20:27.083

1:21:00.625 --> 1:21:01.625
Can I come in?

1:21:06.125 --> 1:21:07.875
I know I fucked up and I'm sorry.

1:21:10.125 --> 1:21:11.375
Do you love him?

1:21:11.458 --> 1:21:15.500
I don't know. Kind of.
It's kind of driving me crazy, you know?

1:21:17.416 --> 1:21:19.250
I invited you to Sado Island.

1:21:19.333 --> 1:21:21.833
I was the one who introduced you
in the first place.

1:21:21.916 --> 1:21:24.083
I know you're angry,
and this isn't an excuse,

1:21:24.166 --> 1:21:26.958
but maybe there's a bigger reason
for all of this that...

1:21:27.041 --> 1:21:29.583
-that we don't understand.
-Well, did you see it in my palm?

1:21:30.375 --> 1:21:32.416
Did you dream it was meant to be?

1:21:34.041 --> 1:21:37.125
He was the only person
who ever really saw who I was!

1:21:37.208 --> 1:21:39.333
I'm sorry, Lucy. Okay?

1:21:39.416 --> 1:21:42.125
I'm sorry! But can I please come in?

1:21:44.166 --> 1:21:46.625
I feel like something really bad
is gonna happen.

1:21:47.125 --> 1:21:48.125
It already has.

1:21:59.291 --> 1:22:00.625

[guard] Louisa Fly.

1:23:32.166 --> 1:23:33.541
[in Japanese] Come with me, please.

[Kameyama] <i>The DNA test came back.</i>

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.083
<i>Looks like the girl in the bay</i>

1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:54.416
<i>was not your friend after all.</i>

1:23:56.291 --> 1:23:57.541
Who was it?

1:23:58.583 --> 1:23:59.833
[Kameyama] We don't know.

1:24:00.416 --> 1:24:01.333
But...

1:24:02.083 --> 1:24:04.500
we do know it wasn't Lily Bridges.

1:24:05.125 --> 1:24:08.833
That puts your statement in serious doubt.

1:24:11.333 --> 1:24:13.666
Did you murder Lily Bridges?

1:24:21.250 --> 1:24:22.291
No.

1:24:23.041 --> 1:24:24.916
Then why did you say you did?

1:24:25.416 --> 1:24:27.250
Because I wanted to kill her.

1:24:27.333 --> 1:24:29.916
[Oguchi]
You do realize the crime you confessed to

1:24:30.375 --> 1:24:32.000
would be punishable by death?

1:24:34.375 --> 1:24:39.375
We have been unable to locate Mr. Matsuda.

1:24:41.166 --> 1:24:42.875
Do you know where he is?

1:24:47.666 --> 1:24:52.083
Do you think there’s a possibility
that Lily and Matsuda may have

1:24:52.708 --> 1:24:54.250
run off somewhere together?

1:24:55.083 --> 1:24:56.000
Yes.

1:24:58.291 --> 1:24:59.541
I thought so.

1:25:02.291 --> 1:25:06.500
At this point, we are reclassifying this
as a missing persons case.

1:25:07.583 --> 1:25:10.041
I think I may have preferred it
when she was dead.

1:25:13.666 --> 1:25:14.666
Well...

1:25:17.375 --> 1:25:21.083
we all live in our own reality.

1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:26.875
Maybe, in some way,

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:29.625
you thought you did kill Lily Bridges.

1:25:31.791 --> 1:25:35.583
But I never felt so.

1:25:37.208 --> 1:25:41.250
You have guilt,
but it is from a deeper source.

1:25:43.333 --> 1:25:44.666
Why did you come to Japan?

1:25:45.166 --> 1:25:46.458
Why do you ask?

1:25:47.125 --> 1:25:48.166
Tell me.

1:25:53.666 --> 1:25:55.166
There was this tree.

1:25:58.041 --> 1:25:59.833
I used to climb it.

1:26:01.250 --> 1:26:02.750
All the way up.

1:26:04.916 --> 1:26:05.958
Sometimes...

1:26:06.833 --> 1:26:09.166
I would take a book and read.

1:26:14.250 --> 1:26:15.250
One day...

1:26:16.708 --> 1:26:22.041
my brothers showed up. They had been
on a fishing trip with the Boy Scouts.

1:26:24.083 --> 1:26:25.583
I was eight.

1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:30.000
They surrounded the tree

1:26:30.750 --> 1:26:34.375
and started throwing pine cones
and stones...

1:26:36.583 --> 1:26:37.708
at me.

1:26:41.291 --> 1:26:43.208
I told them to stop.

1:26:47.416 --> 1:26:49.541
There was this sharp heavy stone
on the ground.

1:26:51.458 --> 1:26:52.583
I saw my brother...

1:26:53.958 --> 1:26:57.000
Marcus, he had his hands on it.

1:26:58.708 --> 1:26:59.875
I met his eyes.

1:27:00.958 --> 1:27:02.333
And his arm came up.

1:27:04.583 --> 1:27:05.500
Then I just...

1:27:08.583 --> 1:27:09.875
jumped...

1:27:12.375 --> 1:27:13.916
right onto him.

1:27:17.583 --> 1:27:19.333
Marcus fell back.

1:27:21.291 --> 1:27:23.125
His head was pierced...

1:27:24.083 --> 1:27:27.166
by a long rusty nail
sticking out from a plank of wood.

1:27:28.291 --> 1:27:33.375
He tried to get up
with the plank still attached to him.

1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:36.458
And...

1:27:38.291 --> 1:27:41.375
again, his eyes stared back at me.

1:27:48.250 --> 1:27:50.208
He died in the hospital.

1:27:53.583 --> 1:27:58.291
The nurse said to me,
"It's not your fault."

1:28:00.791 --> 1:28:02.791
I didn't know what she meant.

1:28:03.666 --> 1:28:04.916
So I just said...

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:06.958
"Okay.

1:28:08.166 --> 1:28:09.125
Yeah."

1:28:12.333 --> 1:28:13.416
From that moment,

1:28:15.416 --> 1:28:17.708
I didn't speak for three years.

1:28:22.250 --> 1:28:25.166
It's easy to ignore people
when they are silent.

1:28:28.166 --> 1:28:30.166
So that's what my family did.

1:28:33.125 --> 1:28:34.541
My parents were heartbroken.

1:28:36.208 --> 1:28:40.208
I knew what they were thinking about me.

1:28:42.125 --> 1:28:43.208
So I...

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:45.833
planned my escape.

1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:47.500
[Kameyama] How?

1:28:47.583 --> 1:28:51.166
At the age of 11,
I started learning Japanese.

1:28:56.750 --> 1:28:59.291
That's a very sad story.

1:29:00.958 --> 1:29:01.833
Yes.

1:29:07.375 --> 1:29:09.541
But it has nothing to do with this case.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.375
Can I go now?

1:29:30.666 --> 1:29:32.166

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.875
I'm sorry. He's not in right now.

1:34:00.625 --> 1:34:02.041
Do you want to leave a message?

1:34:03.958 --> 1:34:04.875
No.

1:34:05.625 --> 1:34:06.875
It's okay.

1:34:07.500 --> 1:34:09.500
He will be here tomorrow morning.

1:35:06.625 --> 1:35:07.875
Hello, Lucy.

1:35:15.375 --> 1:35:18.208
I've been waiting for you for two days.

1:35:18.750 --> 1:35:22.166
I knew I had to come here,
that you would understand.

1:35:24.250 --> 1:35:25.875
I was at the police station.

1:35:26.875 --> 1:35:28.166
What did you tell them?

1:35:29.541 --> 1:35:30.625
About you.

1:35:35.875 --> 1:35:36.875
Nothing.

1:35:38.625 --> 1:35:39.625
Then...

1:35:40.166 --> 1:35:41.333
there's hope.

1:35:42.041 --> 1:35:43.208
That's a funny word.

1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:47.416
"Hope."

1:35:48.791 --> 1:35:51.958
We can go away from here, to the north.

1:35:52.625 --> 1:35:55.666
Hokkaido. Or the south, to Kyushu.

1:35:57.375 --> 1:35:59.083

1:36:00.250 --> 1:36:01.875
I've always wanted to go.

I'm good. Thank you.

-Yes.

1:39:10.666 --> 1:39:11.750
I'm sorry.

1:39:12.708 --> 1:39:14.375
It was my mistake to move in here.

1:39:14.791 --> 1:39:16.166
Don't say that.

1:39:16.250 --> 1:39:17.750
You've been so kind.

1:39:18.916 --> 1:39:20.333
Don't mourn him.

1:39:24.375 --> 1:39:25.625
She came to my...

1:39:26.458 --> 1:39:28.291
door that night, Lily.

1:39:30.041 --> 1:39:32.208
She asked me if she could come in.

1:39:34.250 --> 1:39:36.166
-I didn't let her.
-No.

1:39:36.958 --> 1:39:38.791
It wasn't your fault.

1:39:38.875 --> 1:39:39.833
It was.

1:39:45.291 --> 1:39:47.250
Believe me. It was.

1:39:52.541 --> 1:39:53.708
Perhaps.

1:39:55.416 --> 1:39:56.375
But...

1:39:56.958 --> 1:39:59.208
perhaps in a way...

1:40:00.500 --> 1:40:02.291
she saved your life.

1:40:04.333 --> 1:40:06.875
There were others, too. My brother...

1:40:07.916 --> 1:40:10.291
my friend's father, Yamamoto-san.

1:40:10.750 --> 1:40:11.708
Yamamoto-san?

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.875
I can hardly walk up the stairs
without seeing her face.

1:40:26.375 --> 1:40:28.250
May I tell you something?

1:40:30.250 --> 1:40:33.291
I had waxed the steps two days before.

1:40:35.166 --> 1:40:37.708
I only do it once every two years.

1:40:39.708 --> 1:40:42.916
I was worried they were a little slippery.

1:40:46.250 --> 1:40:49.083
I talked to Yamamoto-san earlier that day.

1:40:50.958 --> 1:40:52.583
I nearly warned her.

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.500
But... I only remembered once I'd hung up.

1:41:02.125 --> 1:41:03.625
She always wore...

1:41:04.875 --> 1:41:08.833
very soft tabi socks.

1:41:10.625 --> 1:41:11.500
So...

1:41:12.625 --> 1:41:15.458
would you say it was my fault?
