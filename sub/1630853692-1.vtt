WEBVTT

00:36.136 --> 00:38.438
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH

00:38.505 --> 00:40.073
A VOICE FROM
THE DARKNESS

00:40.140 --> 00:42.008
OFFERED YOU A CHANCE
TO LIVE AGAIN ?

00:42.075 --> 00:43.376
HAVE YOUR ANSWER ?

00:43.443 --> 00:44.878
THERE'S NO TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

00:44.944 --> 00:46.746
YOU'RE A HEARTBEAT
AWAY FROM FLATLINING.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.748
QUICK,
WHAT'S THE ANSWER ?

00:48.815 --> 00:51.151
I'M TODD McFARLANE,
AND I CREATED "SPAWN".

00:51.217 --> 00:53.653
I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER
THE QUESTION I JUST POSED,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.722
BECAUSE A MAN NAMED
AL SIMMONS DIDN'T.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.690
WHEN THE QUESTION
GOT POPPED ON HIM,

00:57.757 --> 01:00.326
HE SIGNED LIKE
SOME STUPID ROOKIE IN BLOOD,

01:00.393 --> 01:03.229
SEE, AL HAD QUALITIES
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD,

01:03.296 --> 01:05.398
A SPECIAL KIND OF WIRING,
THAT<i> MALEBOLGIA,</i>

01:05.465 --> 01:07.033
THE DEVIL LOOKS FOR.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.868
WHEN HE SAID "YES"
TO THAT VOICE,

01:08.935 --> 01:12.138
HE SIGNED ON FOR A LOT MORE
THAN HE BARGAINED FOR.

01:12.205 --> 01:15.008
SO BEFORE YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN A SIMILAR SITUATION,

01:15.074 --> 01:17.577
AND A VOICE CALLS
TO YOU IN THE DARKNESS,

01:17.644 --> 01:19.946
THINK OF AL,
OR AS YOU MAY SEE,

01:20.013 --> 01:23.550
YOU'LL HAVE ALL ETERNITY TO
THINK ABOUT YOUR MISTAKE TOO.

01:23.616 --> 01:27.353
AND NOW "SPAWN",
SO TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS.

01:28.688 --> 01:32.792
Captions made possible by
HOME BOX OFFICE

01:32.859 --> 01:36.062
A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

02:29.415 --> 02:32.485
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
HAVE PASSED.

02:32.552 --> 02:36.723
ONCE AGAIN, IT IS TIME
FOR A NEW WARRIOR TO EMERGE

02:36.789 --> 02:39.559
FROM THE DARKNESS.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.699
THROUGHOUT TIME,

02:46.766 --> 02:49.168
THE BATTLEFIELDS
HAVE CHANGED.

02:49.235 --> 02:52.839
BUT THE PRIZE HAS ALWAYS
REMAINED THE SAME...

02:52.906 --> 02:55.141
THE HUMAN SOUL.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.707
TAKE OUT YOUR
PRESS I.D.,

03:27.774 --> 03:29.876
I WANT HIM TO
SEE WE'RE LEGIT.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.045
THIS IS UGLY SHIT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT, BENNETT.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.881
IF WE GET VERIFIABLE
INFORMATION

03:34.948 --> 03:37.150
AND WE GOT THE BYLINE
OF THE DECADE !

03:37.216 --> 03:39.118
I KNOW.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.420
THIS WAY.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.789
YOU KNOW WE'RE SCREWED
IF HE DOESN'T SHOW.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.090
RELAX, HE'S
A GOOD SOURCE.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.125
NOW DO ME A FAVOR,
TAKE A VALIUM

03:46.192 --> 03:47.894
YOU'RE MAKING
ME CRAZY.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.295
MR. STEVENS ?

03:50.496 --> 03:53.666
I'M DAVE BENNETT,
THIS IS KENNY HAYES.

03:55.201 --> 03:57.170
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.413
LOOKS LIKE...

04:07.480 --> 04:09.449
YOUR MEETING'S
BEEN CUT SHORT.

04:09.515 --> 04:11.384
GOD !

04:15.088 --> 04:16.756
OH GOD !

04:16.823 --> 04:18.858
GOD AIN'T HERE BOY,

04:18.925 --> 04:21.194
I'LL TAKE
THE MESSAGE.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.947
AHH !

04:43.850 --> 04:45.551
NOW, DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M IN THE MOOD

04:45.618 --> 04:47.320
TO RUN A MARATHON ?

04:49.555 --> 04:50.757
DO I ?

04:52.925 --> 04:55.528
OKAY ASSHOLE,
NEXT QUESTION.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.264
WHO ELSE KNOWS ?

04:58.331 --> 05:01.200
I'M WAITING FOR
YOUR ANSWER, SMART BOY.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.905
NO ONE, I DIDN'T
TELL ANYBODY ELSE.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.874
DON'T LIE TO ME,
SMART BOY.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.075
DON'T YOU PISS ME OFF

05:09.142 --> 05:10.777
BY TRYING THAT
CRAP WITH ME.

05:16.082 --> 05:19.852
EACH WARRIOR'S BORN
AS A CLEAN SLATE,

05:19.919 --> 05:21.788
KNOWING NOTHING.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.691
THE ONLY INSTINCTS
WHICH THEY CAN ACT UPON

05:24.757 --> 05:26.793
ARE DRAWN
FROM THEIR PAST.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.306
SO ?

05:40.373 --> 05:44.077
HE'S SEE NO EVIL,
HEAR NO EVIL,
SPEAK NO EVIL.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.979
GOOD, LET'S DO
THIS THING AND GO.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.954
DON'T DO THIS,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

05:55.021 --> 05:59.325
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING,
I SWEAR, PLEASE.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.728
I GOT A FAMILY, KIDS.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.129
AND FOR
THEIR SAKES,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.164
I HOPE DECENT
LIFE INSURANCE.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.537
( male )
LET HIM GO.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.576
JESUS !

06:52.979 --> 06:54.447
AHH !

07:08.094 --> 07:09.796
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU ?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.173
STAY BACK !

07:20.239 --> 07:22.809
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.417
HELP ME !

07:42.161 --> 07:44.330
I LOVE YOU, AL.

07:52.738 --> 07:56.142
OH NO, I CAME
BACK FOR YOU !

07:57.510 --> 07:59.245
WHERE ARE YOU ?

08:01.214 --> 08:04.250
HELL DOES NOT ALLOW
ITS WARRIOR CHILDREN

08:04.317 --> 08:06.919
TO ROAM UNCHECKED.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.990
AND SO EACH IS GIVEN
THEIR PROPER ESCORT.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.796
OH MAN,
I LOVE IT.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.933
ESPECIALLY THE GENT WITH
HIS HEAD ON BACKWARDS !

08:21.000 --> 08:24.570
THAT IS SWEET.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.639
CHECK HIS SHORTS,

08:26.706 --> 08:28.407
I BET THEY'RE
BRIMMIN' OVER !

08:32.011 --> 08:34.780
I SO ENJOY THE
SHAMEFUL DETAILS.

08:39.418 --> 08:43.122
NOW THIS IS VERY TASTY.

08:43.189 --> 08:47.093
I MEAN LOOK AT HIM,
YOU LOOK AT YOU,

08:47.159 --> 08:49.295
YOU'RE A MATCHED SET.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.565
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, SPAWN ?

08:52.632 --> 08:54.400
SPAWN ?

08:56.335 --> 09:00.206
YEAH, AS IN
HELL, SPAWN.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.776
HEY, IT'S WHAT
YOU ARE, BABY.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.445
SO GET USED TO IT.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.514
DID I DO THIS ?

09:08.581 --> 09:10.483
INSTINCT,
SWEETHEART.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.286
YOU'RE A KILLER !

09:13.352 --> 09:16.055
BORN AND BRED.

09:16.122 --> 09:19.191
YOU SEE VIOLENCE,
YOU ACT.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.194
IT'S A GIFT.

09:22.261 --> 09:25.164
THAT'S WHY
HE PICKED YOU.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.002
I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.271
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ME !?

09:33.873 --> 09:36.609
TOO LONG UNDER THE TANNING
BOOTH BY THE LOOK OF IT.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.058
AHHH !

10:01.734 --> 10:03.803
IT'S ME !

10:03.869 --> 10:05.571
WHAT'S HAPPENED !?

10:05.638 --> 10:07.473
WHO AM I !?

10:15.081 --> 10:18.451
HEY BOBBY, I THINK
HE'S COME AROUND.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.190
WANDA...

10:25.257 --> 10:27.226
JESUS CHRIST
ON A CRUTCH,

10:27.293 --> 10:28.894
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT ?!

10:28.961 --> 10:30.096
I DON'T KNOW.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.232
BUT HE MIGHT
NEED HELP.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.434
HEY MISTER,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

10:35.501 --> 10:38.371
YOU'VE BEEN SCREAMING
FOR TEN MINUTES.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.379
WANDA... SHE'LL
KNOW WHO I AM.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.115
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LIE DOWN
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW ?

10:49.181 --> 10:51.617
SLEEP IT OFF,
I KNOW HOW I GET.

10:51.684 --> 10:55.221
TOO MUCH THUNDERBIRD AND
DANCING NAKED IN TIMES SQUARE.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.558
SHE'S... MY WIFE.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.394
WANDA.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.295
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

11:03.362 --> 11:05.164
YOU SAW WHAT HE DID
TO THOSE POOR BASTARDS !

11:05.231 --> 11:07.967
PROBABLY SPEEDING
ON PCP OR SOMETHING !

11:08.034 --> 11:11.303
MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED IS
A LITTLE HAIR...

11:11.370 --> 11:13.906
GET AWAY FROM ME !

11:15.474 --> 11:17.943
JUST TRYING
TO HELP, OKAY ?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.379
I DON'T WANT
YOUR HELP !

11:23.482 --> 11:28.454
WHAT YOU WANT AND NEED
AREN'T THE SAME.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.291
THIS PLACE IS A REFUGE
FROM THE MAELSTROM.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.795
GET OUT OF MY WAY,
OLD MAN.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.799
YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.602
IT'S WHAT YOU LEARN NOW
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

11:43.669 --> 11:46.505
I JUST WANNA GO HOME.

11:46.572 --> 11:49.542
NOW MOVE
OR BE MOVED.

11:49.608 --> 11:54.380
LISTEN, WE ALL WANT
TO GO HOME, MY FRIEND.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.349
BUT IT'S WAR
GETTING THERE.

11:57.416 --> 12:00.619
( sirens )

12:18.270 --> 12:19.939
AMAZING...

12:20.005 --> 12:22.641
YOU MAFIA, DIRT-BAG,
PIECE OF SHIT.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.610
YOU NEVER
LOOKED BETTER.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.378
SIR, I DON'T
THINK THE CSU

12:26.445 --> 12:28.881
IS GOING TO APPRECIATE YOU
SPRINKLING DONUT CRUMBS

12:28.948 --> 12:31.117
ON TO THE DISEASED.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.556
I HATE EARLY MORNING.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.458
NOTHING HUMAN UP
AT THIS HOUR.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.328
NO SIR, JUST US
CIVIL SERVANTS.

12:45.998 --> 12:49.235
AND DEAD MOB
SCUMBAGS.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.504
NICELY PUT, SIR.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.973
TONY TWIST IS GONNA
NEED SERIOUS DRUGS

12:54.039 --> 12:55.608
WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

12:55.674 --> 12:58.244
THESE THREE BOZOS
WERE HIS BEST HITTERS.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.179
SO...

13:00.246 --> 13:02.815
ONE OF THESE THINGS
IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.151
WHAT'S HIS STORY ?

13:05.217 --> 13:06.886
DAVID BENNETT,

13:06.952 --> 13:08.854
JOURNALIST WITH
THE WASHINGTON POST.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.090
SAME AS THE ONE AT
THE ALLEY'S FAR END.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.226
EXCEPT BENNETT'S WON A PULITZER
FOR HIS INVESTIGATIVE PIECE

13:14.293 --> 13:17.429
ON THE CONGRESSIONAL SCANDAL
THREE YEARS AGO.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.698
IF IT AIN'T ON<i> ESPN</i>
I COULDN'T GIVE A SHIT.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.100
NO, SIR.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.202
( helicopter buzzing )

13:26.906 --> 13:29.542
OKAY, SO WE GOT TWO DEAD
REPORTERS FROM WASHINGTON.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.443
THREE DEAD HITTERS
FOR TONY TWIST,

13:31.510 --> 13:33.179
WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER STIFF ?

13:33.245 --> 13:35.848
HOMELESS,
NO I.D.,

13:35.915 --> 13:38.083
HIS PRINTS
CAME UP NIL.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.186
PROBABLY JUST AN
ALLEY MUSHROOM

13:40.252 --> 13:41.987
POPPED UP AT
THE WRONG TIME.

13:42.054 --> 13:45.291
ANOTHER VERBAL
ACE, SIR.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.726
TWITCH ?

13:47.793 --> 13:48.861
SIR.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.696
FIND ME A CONNECTION
BETWEEN ALL THESE TOE-TAGS,

13:50.763 --> 13:52.264
BUT FIRST,

13:52.331 --> 13:54.099
FIND ME SOME WITH
CHOCOLATE SPRINKLES.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.634
TWO DOZEN, SIR ?

13:55.701 --> 13:58.237
HALF THAT, YOU KNOW
I'M ON A DIET.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.406
( honking )

14:37.776 --> 14:39.211
( voices )
THAT'S YOUR BEST FRIEND...

14:39.278 --> 14:40.546
... BEST FRIEND....

14:43.649 --> 14:45.517
HERE'S TO AL SIMMONS,

14:45.584 --> 14:48.721
THE BEST FRIEND A POOR
NUMBER PUNCHIN' JERK LIKE ME

14:48.787 --> 14:50.089
COULD EVER HAVE.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.626
( girl )
DAD...

14:53.692 --> 14:54.560
WAIT, HONEY.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.527
DADDY.

14:55.594 --> 14:58.130
SOMEONE WANTS
TO SAY GOODBYE.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.665
BYE BYE,
DADDY.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.667
SEE YOU LATER,
SWEETNESS.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.742
PERHAPS YOU CAN DO THAT
WITH<i> ME</i> LATER, MISTER.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.545
BYE-BYE, SWEETIE.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.880
( wife )
BYE-BYE.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.215
( daughter )
BYE-BYE.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.252
OKAY CYAN, LET'S GET
YOU OFF DAY-CARE.

15:23.889 --> 15:26.525
AS THEY TEAR AWAY
EACH NEW LAYER,

15:26.592 --> 15:29.561
THERE'S ALSO AN
AGONIZING PRICE TO PAY.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.270
HOW LONG HAS
IT BEEN !?

15:39.204 --> 15:41.540
WHERE HAVE I BEEN !?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.476
GODAMMIT, WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO ME !?

15:44.543 --> 15:48.380
IT'S HELL'S PLAN
TO KEEP THE NEW RECRUITS

15:48.447 --> 15:50.149
CONFUSED,

15:50.215 --> 15:53.452
HOPING TO DISCOURAGE
THE WARRIORS OF ANY

15:53.519 --> 15:56.055
PERSONAL MISSION.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.324
OH, PLEASE !

15:58.390 --> 16:00.259
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GETTING ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE

16:00.326 --> 16:02.161
OVER A WOMAN !

16:02.227 --> 16:04.363
OKAY, SO SHE WAS
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE

16:04.430 --> 16:05.931
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERED TO YOU

16:05.998 --> 16:07.633
IN THIS
WHOLE DISGUSTING,

16:07.700 --> 16:10.169
PUTRID, LITTLE UNIVERSE.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.805
OKAY, SO NOW YOUR
FORMER BEST FRIEND COMES IN

16:12.871 --> 16:15.007
AND THE AMIGO IS
PUTTING IT TO HER

16:15.074 --> 16:17.109
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.311
OKAY, SO SHE
WANTED KIDS

16:19.378 --> 16:22.781
AND YOU WERE
OBVIOUSLY FIRING BLANKS.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.453
WANT A LICK ?

16:27.519 --> 16:29.121
IT'S ROCKY ROAD.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.257
GET AWAY FROM ME.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.892
YOU CAN'T BLAME
HER THOUGH.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.528
AFTERALL,

16:36.595 --> 16:39.498
YOU'VE BEEN DEAD
ALMOST FIVE YEARS.

16:40.366 --> 16:41.700
YOU'RE LYING.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.736
IF I'M LYING
I'M DYING,

16:43.802 --> 16:45.504
WHICH WOULD BE
KIND OF REDUNDANT.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.339
ANYWAY SPAWN,

16:47.406 --> 16:50.109
YOUR FORMER SELF, MEANING
ONE HELL-BENT FOR LEATHER,

16:50.175 --> 16:52.978

THEIR HEADS ON BACKWARDS

22:15.834 --> 22:17.335

22:17.402 --> 22:19.738
Their bones get pretzeled
by somebody who knows

22:19.805 --> 22:22.107

right.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.508

gets taken out by some asshole

22:30.749 --> 22:33.018

ANY OF MINE.

22:49.334 --> 22:50.902
AND IF I WERE YOU,

22:50.969 --> 22:53.205
I'D BE VERY CAREFUL
ABOUT THE NEXT TIME

22:53.271 --> 22:54.940
I MADE SUCH STRONG
IMPLICATIONS

22:55.006 --> 22:56.942
WITHOUT THE FACTS.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.644
SO WHAT ABOUT
THE JOURNALISTS ?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.913
Tomorrow's

I'LL SEND YOU HIS LIVER AND
MAYBE A COUPLE OF FINGERS.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.871
( telephone dialing )

23:25.937 --> 23:28.073
Hello.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.075

BEEN DEALT WITH.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.543

23:31.610 --> 23:33.478
MAFIA ELEMENTS,
NOTHING TRACEABLE.

23:33.545 --> 23:36.681
Good, thank you.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.317
AND AS WE
DISCUSSED...

23:39.384 --> 23:41.820
The appropriations
are already in place.

23:41.887 --> 23:44.289
As of now you've got
unlimited credit

23:44.356 --> 23:46.358
with The Department
of Defense.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.193
I APPRECIATE
THAT, SENATOR.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.961
Believe me,
it was worth it.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.496
Now I'll feel
free to call

23:51.563 --> 23:53.465

further complications.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.167

23:55.233 --> 23:57.369
HOW LONG DO YOU
INTEND TO COVER FOR HIM ?

23:57.435 --> 23:59.938
As long as
I have to.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.240
HE'S A CHILD KILLER.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.642
Look we've been
through this before--

24:03.708 --> 24:04.910
you don't have a son,

24:04.976 --> 24:06.611
let alone one you
can give your name to.

24:06.678 --> 24:09.681
So what he does is
my problem, understand ?

24:09.748 --> 24:11.349
THESE JOURNALISTS
WON'T BE THE LAST.

24:11.416 --> 24:13.218
YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS
QUIET FOREVER.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.721
Yes I can, you see, the
dead keep their secrets.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.827

24:44.549 --> 24:46.551

24:52.157 --> 24:53.625
WHY IS IT THAT
PEOPLE WITH AUTHORITY

24:53.692 --> 24:55.727

25:22.787 --> 25:24.956

26:03.228 --> 26:06.698
