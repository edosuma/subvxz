[Door opens]

00:49.325 --> 00:50.671
- Hi, Sarah?
- Yes.

00:50.705 --> 00:52.190
Hi, I'm Claire.
Nice to meet you.

00:52.224 --> 00:54.468
- Nice to meet you.
- Right this way.

01:01.613 --> 01:03.511
So, what's the plan?

01:03.546 --> 01:07.308
I need a color touch-up,
as you can see, and a trim.

01:08.275 --> 01:10.484
OK, sounds good.

01:10.518 --> 01:13.383
Can I get you something
to drink? Water, wine?

01:13.418 --> 01:16.455
Oh, my gosh,
a glass of wine sounds amazing.

01:16.490 --> 01:17.698
Yes, red.

01:17.732 --> 01:19.734
I'll be right back with that
and the color.

01:32.161 --> 01:33.645
[Pouring wine]

01:40.893 --> 01:42.654
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

01:42.688 --> 01:44.138
Mm.

01:49.799 --> 01:51.766
So, are you in town for work?

01:53.527 --> 01:54.838
Yeah, um...

01:54.873 --> 01:58.394
Is it that obvious
I'm not from around here?

01:58.428 --> 02:00.465
Uh... no.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.474
Do you travel a lot for work?

02:09.508 --> 02:10.785
Yeah.

02:11.579 --> 02:13.616
Must be exciting.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.722
It's not as luxurious
as it seems.

02:17.758 --> 02:19.691
And I miss my family.

02:19.725 --> 02:21.417
Family?

02:21.451 --> 02:23.660
Yep. Husband
and a 12-year-old.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.215
Sweet.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.598
Sometimes I wonder
if I hate being gone so much

02:30.633 --> 02:33.532
because...
he seems so fine with it.

02:33.567 --> 02:34.671
I'm obsolete.

02:34.706 --> 02:37.295
I'm sure that's not true.

02:37.329 --> 02:38.710
Moms are moms.

02:39.987 --> 02:42.714
I guess,
even when we can't be.

02:48.996 --> 02:50.653
What do you do?

02:50.687 --> 02:52.620
Graphic design.

02:52.655 --> 02:54.450
Really?

02:54.484 --> 02:57.418
Didn't think that was a job
you had to travel for.

02:57.453 --> 02:59.834
Seems like a job
you could just do at home.

03:02.665 --> 03:05.875
But I don't know anything
about it, though, really.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.467
Well, you mostly can.

03:11.501 --> 03:15.298
But I prefer to meet
bigger clients face-to-face.

03:16.057 --> 03:17.576
You make a better connection

03:17.611 --> 03:19.682
when you can look them
in the eye.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.792
I wish my hair would do that.

03:28.415 --> 03:30.451
But we all want
what we don't have.

03:31.418 --> 03:33.005
That's certainly true.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.456
- [Phone rings]
- Oh, um...

03:35.491 --> 03:37.044
Do you mind if I get this?
It's my husband.

03:37.078 --> 03:38.666
Not at all.

03:38.701 --> 03:40.323
Hey babe, what's up?

03:41.290 --> 03:43.878
How's David?

03:43.913 --> 03:45.673
Well, you can tell him
I'll be home this weekend,

03:45.708 --> 03:46.778
and it better be done by then.

03:46.812 --> 03:48.780
[Woman] Have a good night,
Claire.

03:48.814 --> 03:51.679
OK, talk to you tomorrow.
Love you, too. Bye.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.479
Am I keeping you late?
I feel bad.

03:58.514 --> 03:59.722
Oh, no.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.724
I work late most week nights.

04:01.758 --> 04:04.520
It seems to be
my most valuable time.

04:07.937 --> 04:11.492
- [Phone beeps]
- Oh, uh... sorry, I, uh...

04:11.527 --> 04:13.529
Well, I met a boy toy here
this week,

04:13.563 --> 04:15.841
and now he won't leave me alone.

04:15.876 --> 04:18.844
- [Phone beeps]
- Yeah?

04:18.879 --> 04:21.088
I'm only human, you know?

04:21.122 --> 04:22.917
It gets lonely.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.850
And even at home
we haven't had sex since...

04:24.885 --> 04:26.818
Are you liking Kansas City?

04:27.646 --> 04:28.958
Oh...

04:29.821 --> 04:31.029
Yeah, uh...

04:31.063 --> 04:32.755
Don't get me wrong,

04:32.789 --> 04:34.791
I love traveling, I...

04:34.826 --> 04:37.587
I love constantly meeting
new people, it's so inspiring.

04:37.622 --> 04:38.657
Yeah.

04:39.796 --> 04:41.488
That's why I do hair.

04:42.696 --> 04:45.423
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:45.457 --> 04:48.322
You get to go in and out
of people's lives,

04:48.357 --> 04:51.567
you hear stories,
you give life advice.

04:52.637 --> 04:54.915
It's almost like
having a family.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.987
Family...

04:58.021 --> 04:59.816
You know something?

04:59.851 --> 05:02.923
I have a sister,
I have two best friends at home,

05:02.957 --> 05:04.683
I even have a therapist,

05:04.718 --> 05:07.617
and the only two people
who know I'm cheating on Greg...

05:07.652 --> 05:09.067
are Boy Toy and you.

05:10.482 --> 05:11.725
Why?

05:11.759 --> 05:13.520
You trust me?

05:13.554 --> 05:15.142
You're a total stranger.

05:15.176 --> 05:19.733
You're... You're outside
my actual real life.

05:19.767 --> 05:22.805
With you, I...
I trust that it doesn't matter.

05:22.839 --> 05:24.945
I trust I'll never
see you again

05:24.979 --> 05:28.673
and my secret just...
vanishes with you.

11:06.424 --> 11:08.150
Hi, Pepper!

11:08.184 --> 11:09.876
How's my girl?

12:44.039 --> 12:45.247
[Sniffs]

12:47.905 --> 12:49.769
[Breathes heavily]

13:09.340 --> 13:11.480
[Sobbing]

14:01.150 --> 14:03.843
I guess we all want
what we don't have.

14:32.423 --> 14:34.425
[Chuckles]

14:53.306 --> 14:55.411
[Phone buzzes]

15:08.045 --> 15:09.909
[Water running]

16:16.561 --> 16:18.736
Are you ever gonna use it?

16:20.669 --> 16:23.189
No, and I told you that
when you bought it for me.

16:23.223 --> 16:26.192
- It's safer.
- Safer than what? Sunshine?

16:26.226 --> 16:27.745
Safer than going alone.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.782
I wouldn't be alone
if you would come with me.

16:30.817 --> 16:32.232
I'm going to take a shower.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.200
I might be gone
by the time you get done.

16:34.234 --> 16:37.444
Well, be careful,
I hear it's dangerous out there.

16:40.102 --> 16:42.173
- [Woman] There you go.
- [Man] Thanks.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.416
Hi.

16:43.450 --> 16:45.245
Hi, what can I get for you?

16:45.280 --> 16:46.798
Can I get a cappuccino, please?

16:46.833 --> 16:49.594
- Yeah, for sure. What size?
- Small.

16:49.629 --> 16:51.217
- Anything else for you?
- No.

16:51.251 --> 16:53.046
Alright.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.681
[Distorted] I'll have that
right out for you.

17:07.716 --> 17:09.200
Thank you.

17:09.235 --> 17:12.272
Medium almond milk chai latte?

17:13.825 --> 17:15.448
Uh...

17:16.311 --> 17:17.346
Claire?

17:20.418 --> 17:22.351
- Want your usual?
- Um...

17:22.386 --> 17:27.253
Chai latte with almond milk,
please.

17:27.287 --> 17:30.290
OK, so your usual.
Um... medium?

17:31.912 --> 17:33.707
- Small is fine.
- OK.

17:37.918 --> 17:39.644
Thanks.

18:00.458 --> 18:01.666
Claire?

18:01.701 --> 18:04.497
That chai for you
that you clearly need.

18:05.843 --> 18:07.155
Thanks.

18:07.948 --> 18:09.433
See you.

19:29.892 --> 19:32.481
Hey, yeah, it's Olivia.
What the fuck?

19:33.482 --> 19:34.828
I get that,

19:34.863 --> 19:36.899
but look in the lower
left-hand corner.

19:36.934 --> 19:39.005
You see where it says
"cuticle management"?

19:39.039 --> 19:42.802
Yeah, this is in fact an ad
for cubicles, not cuticles.

19:42.836 --> 19:44.355
Yeah, it's a problem.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.669
OK, great.

19:47.703 --> 19:49.395
Thank you.

19:54.676 --> 19:57.506
Is it too soon
to say I'm sorry?

19:57.541 --> 19:59.681
- Yeah.
- I heard about Natalie bailing.

19:59.715 --> 20:02.235
She's always been
really reliable, I swear.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.720
It's OK, it's not your fault.
Don't worry about it.

20:04.755 --> 20:06.515
So, what are you going to do?

20:06.550 --> 20:09.277
I texted my regular stylist
this morning.

20:09.311 --> 20:10.761
She doesn't normally
do weddings,

20:10.795 --> 20:13.764
but I begged and hopefully
I'll hear back later today.

20:13.798 --> 20:16.007
- She any good?
- She is amazing.

20:16.042 --> 20:17.492
She was my first choice.

20:17.526 --> 20:20.495
The stuff she does with hair -
jaw-dropping.

20:20.529 --> 20:22.842
Well, if she's so good,
why doesn't she do weddings?

20:22.876 --> 20:25.603
That's a good question.

20:25.638 --> 20:28.503
I think they're a little
high stress for her.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.436
Hmm!

20:55.944 --> 20:58.395
Aren't you worried
about fitting in your dress?

20:58.429 --> 20:59.810
At this rate,
I'll be walking down the aisle

20:59.844 --> 21:02.847
in a baseball cap and overalls,
so I need this.

21:03.814 --> 21:05.712
Is everything else going OK?

21:06.989 --> 21:08.784
As smoothly as possible.

21:08.819 --> 21:10.545
Charlie is a little tense,

21:10.579 --> 21:13.064
but we haven't hired
assassins yet.

21:13.099 --> 21:15.515
Well, if you ever need
a recommendation,

21:15.550 --> 21:16.758
I might know someone.

21:17.483 --> 21:18.587
Oh, really?

21:18.622 --> 21:20.313
Cos your hair lady
just bailed on me,

21:20.348 --> 21:22.073
so what do I do
if your hit man bails on me?

21:22.108 --> 21:23.661
I'd be totally fucked.

22:14.402 --> 22:15.851
[Phone beeps]

22:40.428 --> 22:42.395
Hi Dawn, the usual.

22:42.430 --> 22:44.639
Oh, there's the Claire I know.

22:44.673 --> 22:46.503
You doing better today?

22:46.537 --> 22:47.642
- Great.
- Good.

22:47.676 --> 22:50.092
Everything's great.

22:50.127 --> 22:52.957
- Thank you.
- Hi.

23:11.493 --> 23:13.978
[Door opens]

23:14.013 --> 23:17.016
Hi.
Come on back.

23:17.050 --> 23:20.951
Claire, you are literally
saving my life.

23:20.985 --> 23:22.884
I don't know about all that.

23:22.918 --> 23:25.749
So, tell me everything.

23:25.783 --> 23:27.198
- Oh, could you take this off?
- Oh.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.030
What are you hoping for?

23:31.064 --> 23:32.997
Do you have pictures
of your dress?

23:33.032 --> 23:35.034
Do I have pictures
of the dress!

23:36.484 --> 23:37.554
OK.

23:39.590 --> 23:43.732
Oh, my God,
you look amazing.

23:43.767 --> 23:46.908
Yeah? It's the first one
I tried on.

23:47.495 --> 23:49.048
Amazing.

23:49.082 --> 23:50.498
Perfect.

23:50.532 --> 23:54.087
Alright, so hair,
what are you hoping for?

23:54.122 --> 23:56.676
I mean, with that dress
you could really wear any style.

23:56.711 --> 24:01.923
Yeah, so, like...
down and a little curly.

24:01.957 --> 24:04.270
Do you have any photos of, like,
the styles you like,

24:04.304 --> 24:05.858
so I can kind of
have an idea?

24:05.892 --> 24:09.240
Yeah, I took your advice,
I did a lot of research.

24:10.725 --> 24:12.623
- Like this.
- OK.

24:13.866 --> 24:15.212
I love it.

24:20.562 --> 24:24.117
So, how is Charlie handling
the wedding madness?

24:24.152 --> 24:26.292
Is he excited?

24:26.326 --> 24:27.983
Yeah, I mean,
way more than me.

24:29.157 --> 24:31.539
He loves being the center
of attention.

24:31.573 --> 24:33.161
We should all probably
be worried

24:33.195 --> 24:34.990
that he's going to turn
into a groom-zilla.

24:35.025 --> 24:37.268
[Laughs]

24:37.303 --> 24:40.064
Is it weird
that I'm nervous right now?

24:40.099 --> 24:41.583
A little.

24:41.618 --> 24:43.965
I'm kidding,
it's totally normal.

24:43.999 --> 24:47.969
Hair is important, you know,
maybe the most important.

24:48.003 --> 24:50.937
It's gonna be great, though,
I promise.

25:31.702 --> 25:35.568
Oh, my God, Claire,
this is amazing.

25:35.603 --> 25:37.259
I seriously don't know
why you don't do weddings

25:37.294 --> 25:39.572
all of the time.
This is amazing!

25:39.607 --> 25:41.574
So much better
than the other girl.

25:41.609 --> 25:42.955

[Chuckles]

25:52.827 --> 25:54.691
It's not that
I don't like to do weddings,

25:54.725 --> 25:56.037
I just...

25:56.071 --> 25:58.833
I don't know,
I find them really...

26:00.662 --> 26:02.215
Intense?

26:02.250 --> 26:04.217
Yeah. [Chuckles]

26:06.634 --> 26:07.842
Wow.

26:07.876 --> 26:09.637
Uh! Can't wait to see this
with the dress.

26:09.671 --> 26:11.293
Oh. Neither can I.

26:11.328 --> 26:13.295
- Can you send me a photo?
- Oh, yeah.

26:13.330 --> 26:16.298
Make sure you take it down
before Charlie sees it.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.059
How much do I owe you?

26:18.093 --> 26:20.958
- 65?
- Oh, that's a steal.

26:26.723 --> 26:29.242
I wish I had someone
to show it to tonight.

26:32.452 --> 26:34.385
Hey, what are you doing
tonight?

26:34.420 --> 26:37.872
You wanna come over and see
the hair and dress together?

26:39.218 --> 26:41.703
- I... I'd be happy to.
- Yeah?

26:41.738 --> 26:43.222
Cool, I'll text you
my address.

26:43.256 --> 26:46.259
Oh, I...
I'd appreciate that.

26:46.294 --> 26:50.367
- Like, uh... maybe eat dinner?
- Sure, but what about Charlie?

26:50.401 --> 26:54.129
Oh, he'll probably be working
late, so... girl's night. Yeah?

26:54.164 --> 26:56.684
- Yeah.
- Great. I love it!

26:56.718 --> 26:57.926
Alright, see you tonight.

26:57.961 --> 26:59.341
Yeah.

1:30:36.223 --> 1:30:38.260
Do you promise
to make her happy?

1:30:38.294 --> 1:30:41.056
What, are we practicing
my vows?

1:30:44.128 --> 1:30:46.199
Yeah, of course.

1:30:46.233 --> 1:30:48.443
Do you promise
you really see her?

1:30:50.583 --> 1:30:51.756
I do.

1:30:57.037 --> 1:30:58.073
Let me get that.

1:31:06.046 --> 1:31:07.600
Claire?

1:31:07.634 --> 1:31:09.015
Yeah, hi.

1:31:09.049 --> 1:31:10.188
Great.

1:31:10.223 --> 1:31:12.225
Olivia's right this way,
just follow me.

1:31:12.259 --> 1:31:13.847
Thanks.

1:31:13.882 --> 1:31:16.574
I wasn't sure where to go,
I've never been here before.

1:31:16.609 --> 1:31:18.956
Isn't it so beautiful?

1:31:20.302 --> 1:31:21.821
How do you know Olivia?

1:31:21.855 --> 1:31:23.788
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm her mother.

1:31:23.823 --> 1:31:26.308
I'm... I'm Frankie.

1:31:26.342 --> 1:31:30.070
Oh, it... it's nice
to meet you.

1:31:30.105 --> 1:31:32.245
Olivia talks about you
all the time.

1:31:32.279 --> 1:31:34.489
Don't be silly.

1:31:44.015 --> 1:31:46.501
Oh, my God, Claire.

1:31:47.743 --> 1:31:50.677
Thank you so much
for coming through.

1:31:53.162 --> 1:31:55.302
It means everything.

1:31:55.337 --> 1:31:57.028
Where should I set up?

1:31:57.063 --> 1:31:59.962
- Uh, is right here OK?
- Yeah.

1:31:59.997 --> 1:32:03.794
- Uh, this is for you.

1:32:03.828 --> 1:32:05.623

1:32:34.376 --> 1:32:35.826
I'm ready.

1:33:41.788 --> 1:33:43.376
Go take a look.

1:33:48.105 --> 1:33:49.313
What do you think?

1:33:49.347 --> 1:33:51.142
How does it look?

1:33:51.177 --> 1:33:53.420
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1:33:53.455 --> 1:33:55.422
Beautiful!

1:34:00.358 --> 1:34:03.707
Oh, my God,
I'm so happy for you!

1:34:03.741 --> 1:34:06.295
Do you want to get
your hair done, too?

1:34:06.330 --> 1:34:08.401
Can you make it pretty
like Olivia's?

1:34:09.264 --> 1:34:11.059
Of course I can.

1:34:11.093 --> 1:34:13.302
You're very beautiful,
so it's gonna be easy.

1:34:13.337 --> 1:34:14.752
Come on.

1:34:26.833 --> 1:34:27.938
There you go.

1:34:39.535 --> 1:34:42.435
Olivia, you look amazing.

[Phone beeps]

1:34:45.024 --> 1:34:47.716
Charlie is ready
for the big reveal.

1:34:47.751 --> 1:34:49.856
You want to go see
how he cleans up?

1:34:52.756 --> 1:34:54.102
Got it?

1:35:09.082 --> 1:35:11.360
There you go, now you're ready
to walk down the aisle.

1:35:11.395 --> 1:35:13.259
Thank you.

1:35:17.056 --> 1:35:18.816
Oh, do you know
where the bathroom is?

1:35:18.851 --> 1:35:20.749
Oh, sure.
It's right over there.

1:35:20.784 --> 1:35:22.095
Thanks.

1:35:24.201 --> 1:35:26.237
[Charlie] Do you know
how beautiful you are?

1:35:27.031 --> 1:35:28.550
And how lucky I am?

1:35:28.584 --> 1:35:30.345
Do you know how cold you are?

1:35:31.070 --> 1:35:33.037
Freezing.

1:35:34.556 --> 1:35:36.489
I can't wait to marry you.

1:35:45.084 --> 1:35:46.464
[Knocking on door]

1:35:46.499 --> 1:35:48.052
Hey, they're looking for you.

1:35:48.087 --> 1:35:49.847
Need help with the veil,
I think.

1:35:49.882 --> 1:35:51.469
- On my way.
- OK.

1:36:01.859 --> 1:36:04.793
Oh! Claire, you want to come
over here and help with this,

1:36:04.828 --> 1:36:07.416
so I don't mess up
your beautiful work?

1:36:09.522 --> 1:36:11.041
The usher's here.

1:36:11.075 --> 1:36:14.044
It's time for me to go,
so I'll see you out there?

1:36:14.078 --> 1:36:15.424
Yeah.

1:36:15.459 --> 1:36:17.081
I love you so much.

1:36:17.116 --> 1:36:18.911
I love you, too.

1:36:18.945 --> 1:36:21.051
- OK, baby.
- OK.

1:36:41.381 --> 1:36:43.418
There you go.

1:36:43.452 --> 1:36:45.247
Thanks.

1:36:46.870 --> 1:36:50.977
Sorry that I barked at you
the other day.

1:36:51.012 --> 1:36:54.809
Pressure's just been building
for a while, you know?

1:36:56.224 --> 1:36:57.570
Yes.

1:36:58.260 --> 1:36:59.848
Yes.

1:37:01.643 --> 1:37:03.093
Claire, are you OK?

1:37:07.994 --> 1:37:09.030
No.

1:37:11.308 --> 1:37:13.344
No, I'm sorry.

1:37:16.140 --> 1:37:17.935
I have to tell you something.

1:37:19.143 --> 1:37:20.973
OK.
What is it?

1:37:27.289 --> 1:37:28.532
I don't run.

1:37:30.016 --> 1:37:31.397
What?

1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:38.404
I don't run, Olivia.

1:37:44.651 --> 1:37:46.343
[Sobbing]

1:37:59.943 --> 1:38:01.910
[Man] Here we go.

1:41:02.228 --> 1:41:03.816
[Screaming]

1:41:09.339 --> 1:41:10.754
What did you do?

1:41:14.758 --> 1:41:15.862
What did you do?

1:41:17.312 --> 1:41:18.865
What's going on?

1:41:18.900 --> 1:41:21.144
Where is she? Where is she?

1:41:36.780 --> 1:41:39.886
[Olivia] 'I mean,
look how amazing we turned out.'
