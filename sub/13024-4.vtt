<i>The monster fell from the sky!</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:14.741
It was an epic battle,
but Voltron was victorious!

01:18.245 --> 01:23.125
No. I said, "Voltron was victorious!"

01:28.213 --> 01:32.426
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for that wonderful production.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.012
It saddens me
that we must leave tomorrow,

01:35.095 --> 01:37.389
but we must continue
our battle with Zarkon

01:37.472 --> 01:39.391
and spread peace
throughout the universe.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.642
Your Highness...

01:40.726 --> 01:42.894
please accept this gift.

01:42.978 --> 01:46.273
This will allow you to contact us
anytime you need help.

01:47.566 --> 01:51.278
Arus will be the first planet
in the Voltron Alliance.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.571
Hoorah!

01:56.074 --> 01:58.869
- We ought to get something like that.
- Like what?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.872
You know, like, a cheer.
Like, a team cheer that we do.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.708
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay.
How about, uh...

02:04.791 --> 02:07.669
"I say Vol" and you say "Tron." Vol!

02:09.211 --> 02:11.757
Uh... Voltron?

02:12.633 --> 02:15.260
No! No, no, no.
The cheer includes the instructions.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.012
I say "Vol" and you say...

02:18.513 --> 02:19.806
Voltron?

02:21.391 --> 02:22.768
We'll work on it.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.941
Coran, what is this?

02:30.025 --> 02:32.527
Oh, this is Nunvill,
the nectar of the gods.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.696
It tastes like hot dog water and feet.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.199
Yeah, makes
a wonderful hair tonic as well.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.955
Not feeling well? Try some Nunvill.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.124
Settles the stomach
and brightens your smile.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.795
I'm not sure we should be letting everyone
wander in and out of the castle like this.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.254
It doesn't seem safe.

02:51.338 --> 02:55.759
Oh, these Arusians won't
hurt anything... much.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.347
Besides, it's only fair to let them
see the inside of a castle

03:00.430 --> 03:02.307
that's been sitting
on their planet for so long.

03:02.391 --> 03:05.018
But who knows
when Zarkon will attack again?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.772
I'm going to do a perimeter check,
just in case.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.869
Commander Sendak, the sentries are
in position around the Arusian village.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.746
Luck is on our side.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.792
Look, the Castle defenses are down.
The door is wide open.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.128
With all these Arusians coming in and out,

03:31.211 --> 03:34.214
it should be nothing
for you to infiltrate.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.174
I may not have to. Look.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.720
The small one has a Galra drone
they've repurposed.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.806
If I can just get close enough
to clone its signature code,

03:42.889 --> 03:45.726
I can send our bomb drone in undetected.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.645
I knew you would not disappoint me, Haxus.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.282
Look at them,
the new Paladins of Voltron.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.118
The fate of the universe
is on their shoulders.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.788
My eyes!

04:10.041 --> 04:12.627
I must portray strength,
so no one can tell how

04:12.628 --> 04:15.213
concerned I am about
the fate of our mission.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.301
Let's keep that a secret.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.888
Who else has secrets?

04:25.515 --> 04:28.226
Hunk tried to eat what?

04:28.310 --> 04:31.813
That is rather amusing.
What other secrets?

04:35.776 --> 04:39.196
That seems like Lance.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.785
Pidge is a what?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.704
Hmm...

04:58.298 --> 05:00.175
Are you sure?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.302
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.764
I guess we should get used
to this space juice.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.016
Who knows
when we'll get back home again?

05:08.099 --> 05:10.227
Yeah, if ever.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.436
What do you mean?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.356
I mean, if this Zarkon guy has
been ruling for 10,000 years,

05:14.439 --> 05:16.566
how long do you think
it will take for us to fix it?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.984
You know, if we live.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.362
Right. That.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.532
Hey, what do you think the chances are
of us landing on a nacho planet?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.952
Well, there's only one planet
with Veradera Beach,

05:27.035 --> 05:32.582
pizza shack looking over the water
and the garlic knots and my mom's hugs...

05:34.209 --> 05:38.338
I'm sorry. I think this Nunvill
is getting to me. I gotta go.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.557
So, Pidge, we haven't had
a chance to really talk.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.933
Tell me about yourself.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.226
Hmm...

05:51.309 --> 05:54.396
Well, I like peanut butter,
and I like peanut butter cookies,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.064
but I hate peanuts.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.232
They're so dry.

05:57.315 --> 06:01.319
Also, I sweat a lot. I mean, in general,
unrelated to the peanuts.

06:02.070 --> 06:06.199
I suppose I was thinking of something
a little more personal.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.828
We have a lot in common.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.288
Like what?

06:11.413 --> 06:15.875
Oh, well, both of us had our fathers
taken away by Zarkon.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.752
Yeah, but I'm going to get mine back.

06:19.170 --> 06:23.592
- I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to...
- No, I understand.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.595
I just want you to know
that you can confide in me.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.390
If there's anything
you ever want to talk about...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.227
- Anything.
- Huh?

06:35.520 --> 06:40.525
- Okay. I do have something to tell you.
- I had a feeling. What is it?

06:41.526 --> 06:43.278
I'm leaving Team Voltron.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.822
Wait, what?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.033
I decrypted the information
from the Galra ship

06:48.116 --> 06:51.119
about where my family might be,
or at least where they were.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.330
I've made up my mind.
I'm leaving tonight.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.458
Pidge, you can't.
You're one of five paladins.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.002
You have a sacred trust
to defend the universe.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.588
My first priority is to find my family!

07:01.671 --> 07:03.590
I thought you of all people
would understand.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.134
If you had a chance to get
your father back, wouldn't you?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.764
I'm sorry.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.682
I should go tell everyone else.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.651
Shiro?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.277
I need to talk to you.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.041
Signature code cloned.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.219
Bomb activated.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.447
Mind if I join you?

08:11.282 --> 08:13.743
How far away from Earth
do you think we are, Coran?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.036
Let's take a look.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.999
Earth is over here.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.750
And we're all...

08:23.169 --> 08:26.506
the way over...

08:26.589 --> 08:29.092
You ever notice how far the planets
are from each other, Coran?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.928
Yes. Haven't you been paying attention?

08:32.011 --> 08:36.057
Yeah, but I mean, like,
they're really, really far away.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.727
Like, say, Earth.
It's so far, I can't even see it.

08:39.811 --> 08:44.566
The... The blue oceans,
the white clouds, green grass...

08:44.649 --> 08:46.860
I... I can't see any of it.

08:46.943 --> 08:50.363
You miss Earth. I understand.
I miss Altea.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.532
I know we're supposed
to be brave paladins

08:52.615 --> 08:54.367
and Defenders of the Universe
or whatever,

08:54.451 --> 08:57.746
but, honestly, I just want to go home.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.206
If I could go home, I would.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.084
I miss rain and
splashing in puddles.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.171
- Rain?
- Yeah. It's water that falls from the sky.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.839
Oh, we had that on Altea.

09:07.922 --> 09:12.010
Only, it wasn't water, more like rocks.
Razor-sharp and boiling-hot.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.095
Oh, they could knock a hole
right in your head.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.556
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.030
Pidge, no.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.907
The download
from the Galra ship was enough

09:33.990 --> 09:36.618
to at least get me in the right direction
to start my search.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.953
- I have a pod all ready to go.
- You can't leave.

09:39.037 --> 09:44.084
- You can't tell me what to do!
- If you leave, we can't form Voltron.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.711
And that means we can't defend
the universe against Zarkon.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.005
You're not the only one with a family.

09:49.089 --> 09:53.802
All these Arusians have families.
Everyone in the universe has families.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.512
Yeah, I have a family.
They live on Earth.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.056
I want to be with them.
Is that, like, a thing that can happen?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.934
- You want to leave, too?
- Of course I do!

10:01.017 --> 10:03.061
Look, Voltron is super-cool,
don't get me wrong,

10:03.144 --> 10:07.023
but I never signed up for a lifetime
in space, fighting aliens.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.359
You're putting the lives of two people

10:09.442 --> 10:12.028
over the lives of everyone else
in the entire galaxy!

10:12.112 --> 10:14.614
Keith, that's not how a team works.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.617
People have to want to be a part of it.
They can't be forced.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.122
If you want to leave,
we won't try to stop you.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.875
But, please, just think
about what you're doing.

10:28.628 --> 10:33.633
I'm sorry. You're going to have to find
someone else to pilot the Green Lion.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.721
I can't believe it.
This team is falling apart.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.890
How will we ever form Voltron?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.481
Hey, Rover.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.696
Wait. Where's Pidge?

10:58.032 --> 10:59.409
Coran, look out!

11:03.955 --> 11:05.081
Huh?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.408
The crystal!

11:41.659 --> 11:42.660
Lance!

11:43.703 --> 11:46.372
Lance? Lance!

11:47.665 --> 11:49.751
We have to get Lance to the infirmary!

11:49.834 --> 11:52.378
Without the crystal,
the Castle has no power.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.049
He doesn't look good.

11:56.132 --> 12:00.345
Lion warriors, our village
is under attack! We need help!

12:00.428 --> 12:02.931
- Let's get to the lions!
- You can't.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.142
They're sealed in their hangars.
There's no way to get them out.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.895
- We're defenseless.
- Will you not help us?

12:08.978 --> 12:12.774
We'll help you. We just...

12:13.816 --> 12:15.151
This is bad.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.654
We have to get a new crystal
to get the Castle working again.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.572
But, to get a new crystal,
we need a ship.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.992
The pod I was loading, we can use that!
I left the bay door open.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.162
I can use the scanner in the pod
to see if there's a Balmera nearby.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.415
Hunk, you come with me. I'll need
someone big to help me carry the crystal.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.583
A Balmera?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.378
It's where the crystals come from.
I'll tell you about it on the way!

12:34.045 --> 12:36.047
I'll go see what's happening
at the Arusian village.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.342
I'll go with you, Keith.
I brought this on the poor Arusians.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.095
I'll tend to Lance
and stand watch over the Castle.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.979
It's our first bit of luck.
There's a source not too far.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.272
We won't need a wormhole
to get there, thankfully.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.986
I made some modifications to the shuttle.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.905
The first change is a cloaking device
that I reverse-engineered

13:00.989 --> 13:03.366
from the invisible walls
on the training deck.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.619
The second is a tank of booster fuel
that I mounted on the fuel line.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.789
Using that during flight would turn
the whole pod into a bomb!

13:11.207 --> 13:14.252
Okay. Maybe you shouldn't use
that modification after all.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.672
- We ready to hit it?
- Right. Let's go.

13:23.970 --> 13:24.971
Good luck.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.485
Hang on, buddy.
Help is on the way.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.789
Sendak.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.347
Stand aside.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.350
No. You're not getting in.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.561
Yes, I am.

14:48.554 --> 14:53.434
I see you spent some time with the druids.
They do love to experiment.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.104
Too bad you didn't get the latest model.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.513
Let him go or
your friend won't make it!

15:46.279 --> 15:48.448
Voltron is ours.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.786
Oh, no.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.627
- What's happening?
- Look! Attackers!

16:04.547 --> 16:06.048
I'll go in for a closer look.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.633
- Stay here with them.
- Keith!

16:26.444 --> 16:27.278
What?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.409
Oh, no. They tricked us!

16:33.493 --> 16:38.164
<i>It was just a diversion to separate
us and thin the Castle defenses!</i>

16:40.625 --> 16:42.210
Power up the Castle.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.231
The lions are all in their bays.

17:03.314 --> 17:07.443
Raising particle barrier.
Begin launch sequence.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.493
We're too late. No!

17:16.577 --> 17:20.373
They have control of the Castle.
They're taking Voltron!

17:22.959 --> 17:25.169
Make contact with Emperor Zarkon.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.176
<i>Sendak.</i>

17:32.260 --> 17:33.844
My mission is complete.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.932
I've captured the Altean Castle,
along with all of the Voltron lions.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.142
I am currently preparing for launch

17:40.226 --> 17:42.895
and will be delivering them all
to you shortly.

17:42.979 --> 17:48.943
<i>This news is most pleasing.
You have done your duty. Vrepit Sa!</i>

17:49.026 --> 17:50.987
<i>Vrepit Sa!</i>

17:51.112 --> 17:55.157
- Haxus, ready the Castle for takeoff.
- Yes, Commander.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.955
- Can we break through the barrier?
- No.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.624
And whoever has taken the Castle
has a crystal,

18:03.708 --> 18:06.127
which means they'll be able
to fly the ship.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.545
We have to stop them.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.882
<i>- How are we going to do that?
- Keith, can you hear me?</i>

18:11.966 --> 18:14.594
Pidge, is that you? Where are you?

18:14.677 --> 18:16.178
I'm inside the Castle.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.931
Sendak has taken over
and he's preparing for launch.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.516
He's got Lance and Shiro.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.853
Pidge, listen. If they've started
the launch sequence,

18:23.936 --> 18:27.231
then we don't have much time
before liftoff to stop it.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.649
What do I have to do?

18:28.733 --> 18:31.736
You have to get down
to the main engine control panel

18:31.819 --> 18:36.073
and disconnect the primary turbine
from the central energy chamber.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.952
<i>If you can do that, Sendak will have
to reset the whole system.</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:42.663
<i>That might give us enough time
to find a way to stop them.</i>

18:47.376 --> 18:49.545
<i>Is this the Balmera
planet with the crystals?</i>

18:49.629 --> 18:52.256
It's not a planet.
Balmera are ancient animals.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.050
Petrified, but still alive.

18:54.842 --> 18:59.263
<i>Their bodies naturally create the crystals
that help power mini Altean ships.</i>

18:59.347 --> 19:02.308
I often accompanied my grandfather
to visit these majestic creatures

19:02.391 --> 19:04.352
when he was building the Castle of Lions.

19:04.435 --> 19:07.980
I'll never forget the first time
I saw the sparkling surface of a Balmera.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.482
You're in for quite a treat.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.696
Oh, no. This is horrifying.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.366
<i>The Galra have turned this
into a mining colony!</i>

19:18.449 --> 19:22.286
<i>They're completely destroying it!
They have no regard for the poor creature!</i>

19:24.580 --> 19:27.166
Uh-oh.
We've been spotted.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.585
<i>Hailing unidentified craft.</i>

19:29.669 --> 19:33.005
<i>State your ship ID, entry code,
and landing destination.</i>

19:33.089 --> 19:37.259
- Oh, no. What do we do?
- Just stay calm.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.928
We don't really need to land.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.597
Uh, we're just looking around,
if that's okay.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.933
<i>Unidentified craft, land immediately</i>

19:44.016 --> 19:46.185
<i>and prepare to be boarded.</i>

19:46.268 --> 19:50.064
Okay. Thank you.
See you down below.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.704
<i>Not done yet.
Hang on!</i>

20:16.298 --> 20:17.967
<i>Coran! Coran!</i>

20:22.263 --> 20:24.432
How deep is this thing?

20:24.515 --> 20:25.975
<i>Oh, no, no, no!</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:54.879
Coran, what lives
at the bottom of these mines?

21:04.138 --> 21:05.723
Here, Rover.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.394
Okay, Rover, here we go.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.986
Run main cluster activation sequence.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.531
Activation sequence initiated.
Powering up for launch.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.161
Okay, Allura, I'm near the turbine.
I think it's started.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.871
Then you'll have to hurry.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.540
Cross the catwalk
to the main column in the center.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.338
<i>- Okay.
- Now, open the hatch.</i>

21:37.421 --> 21:41.425
<i>Find the central computer control hub
and enter the following sequence...</i>

21:41.509 --> 21:45.554
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Which one is it?
All the labels are in Altean!

21:45.638 --> 21:48.015
Commander Sendak,
we are ready for launch.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.567
I can't tell which one it is!
Allura? Allura?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.282
Uh...

22:05.366 --> 22:09.745
I've lost connection with Pidge!
Oh, no! It's taking off!

22:13.916 --> 22:15.543
Uh...

22:17.253 --> 22:18.254
Whatever.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.551
Huh?

22:34.937 --> 22:36.438
The main engine just shorted out!

22:43.904 --> 22:48.701
We have a saboteur.
Find him and take him out.

22:51.389 --> 22:54.238
