AND NOW, THROWING OUT
THE CEREMONIAL FIRST PITCH,

00:37.970 --> 00:42.440
BROADWAY STAR
BERNADETTE PETERS!

00:43.476 --> 00:46.578
WOW. BERNADETTE
BROUGHT THE HEAT!

00:46.645 --> 00:50.248
THEY SHOULD PROBABLY
TEST HER FOR STEROIDS.

00:50.315 --> 00:52.950
THAT'S NOTHING. YOU SEE
REESE WITHERSPOON LAST WEEK?

00:53.018 --> 00:55.754
<i>SHE COULD BE A YANKEE
RIGHT NOW.</i>

00:55.821 --> 00:56.570
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

00:56.638 --> 00:58.540
WHERE THE HELL
YOU BEEN?

00:58.607 --> 01:00.675
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO THAT NEW
PLACE WITH THE DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW.

01:00.743 --> 01:02.027
YEAH, I DID.
IT WAS ALL BACKED UP.

01:02.094 --> 01:03.862
THEY MADE THEIR WINDOW
TOO SMALL.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.598
THEY HAD TO SHIMMY
THE BOX OUT SIDEWAYS.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.051
WELL, BASICALLY WE HAVE

01:10.119 --> 01:12.821
HALF EXTRA CHEESE,
HALF NO CHEESE.

01:14.456 --> 01:17.876
WELL, I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHICH SIDE I'M EATING FROM.

01:17.943 --> 01:19.560
ENJOY YOUR SKIN FLAP.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.749
SPENCE, WILL YOU STOP
STARING OUT THE WINDOW, MAN?

01:24.817 --> 01:25.717
YOU'RE CREEPIN' ME
OUT.

01:25.784 --> 01:27.752
I'M WAITING FOR LOU FERRIGNO
TO GET HOME.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.854
WHERE IS HE?

01:29.922 --> 01:31.189
SPENCE, LOU IS NOT
GONNA GO WITH YOU

01:31.257 --> 01:33.107
ON YOUR LITTLE
SCI-FI GEEK-FEST.

01:33.175 --> 01:35.627
YEAH. FANTASY EXPO '05
IS A GEEK-FEST.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.496
THAT'S WHY 3 DIFFERENT
HOBBITS ARE SHOWING UP.

01:41.216 --> 01:43.034
YOU KNOW,
AT A CERTAIN POINT,

01:43.102 --> 01:45.136
WE CAN'T PROTECT YOU
ANYMORE.

01:46.588 --> 01:48.423
OH! THERE HE IS.

01:48.491 --> 01:52.060
YES! TARGET ACQUIRED.

01:53.329 --> 01:56.046
NO, THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.
NOT TODAY!

01:56.114 --> 01:57.098
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:57.166 --> 01:59.434
JUST EAT IT OFF YOUR
SHIRT LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

01:59.501 --> 02:01.486
NO, HE'S GOTTA BE
ALL G.Q.ed UP.

02:01.554 --> 02:04.772
<i>HE'S GETTING HIS HAIR
CUT BY LORI.</i>

02:04.840 --> 02:07.158
OH HO.
SHE'S A NEAT FREAK.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.496
NO, MAN. SHE'S HOT.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.231
OH! BETTER YET. HA.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.166
HEY, I'M IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW HAIR GIRL.

02:15.234 --> 02:16.851
COULD YOU HOOK ME UP?

02:16.919 --> 02:20.755
MMM, I WOULD, BUT SHE DOESN'T
LIKE TO CUT LOSER HAIR.

02:20.823 --> 02:22.040
WHAT?

02:22.107 --> 02:23.942
I DON'T WANT YOU
GOIN' TO HER.

02:24.009 --> 02:25.509
WHY NOT?

02:25.577 --> 02:28.429
BECAUSE SHE'S MINE,
ALL RIGHT? GET YOUR OWN.

02:28.497 --> 02:29.947
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

02:30.015 --> 02:32.467
YOU CAN GO TO MY GIRL. I
MEAN, SHE WEIGHS ABOUT 3 BILLS,

02:32.535 --> 02:34.402
BUT SHE'LL BRAID YOU UP
REAL NICE.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.390
IF YOU WANT MY OPINION,
IN TERMS OF STYLE,

02:39.458 --> 02:41.459
HANDLING, AND PURE LUXURY,

02:41.527 --> 02:43.961
YOU CAN'T BEAT
THE PARK AVENUE.

02:44.029 --> 02:45.964
I THINK WE COULD
BOTH AGREE

02:46.115 --> 02:47.982
THAT BUICK
MAKES A GREAT CAR.

02:48.050 --> 02:49.451
CAN I GO IN NOW?

02:49.518 --> 02:51.536
YEAH, W-LOU, LOU, LOU.
ONE MORE THING.

02:51.603 --> 02:56.274
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, UH...
3 WEEKS FROM NEXT SUNDAY?

02:56.342 --> 02:57.525
WHY?

02:57.593 --> 02:59.860
THERE'S A KINDA
SCI-FI CONVENTION

02:59.928 --> 03:01.262
OUT AT THE MEADOWLANDS.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.431
I WAS THINKING IF YOU WANTED
TO GO, I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

03:03.499 --> 03:04.932
WE CAN WALK AROUND.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.719
YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE ME
BECAUSE I WAS THE HULK.

03:07.786 --> 03:09.253
YOU-YOU WERE THE HULK?

03:09.321 --> 03:10.254
<i>OH, THAT'S RIGHT!</i>

03:10.322 --> 03:11.956
I TOTALLY FORGOT!

03:14.877 --> 03:16.644
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

03:16.712 --> 03:17.945
I DON'T DO THAT STUFF
ANYMORE.

03:18.013 --> 03:20.098
LOU, PLEASE!

03:20.166 --> 03:22.600
THAT CHAPTER IN MY LIFE
IS CLOSED.

03:22.668 --> 03:24.802
Y- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

03:24.870 --> 03:26.888
I MEAN, IF I COULD
SHOW UP WITH THE HULK...

03:26.956 --> 03:28.790
<i>I'D FINALLY BE SOMEBODY,</i>

03:28.858 --> 03:32.026
NOT SOME LOSER
WEARING FAKE SPOCK EARS

03:32.094 --> 03:35.363
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE
THE GUTS TO GET THE SURGERY.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.764
OK, FINE.

03:36.832 --> 03:41.235
BUT NO GREEN PAINT
AND NO PURPLE PANTS.

03:41.303 --> 03:44.422
LOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU! OK?

03:44.489 --> 03:47.759
UM... AND YOU MIGHT WANNA SAVE
SOME OF THAT ANGER FOR THE EXPO.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.002
HEY, HONEY,
I'M GOING SHOPPING.

03:58.070 --> 04:00.137
I HAVE A COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIST.

04:00.205 --> 04:01.439
SHOOT.

04:01.506 --> 04:03.407
NOW, I DON'T MIND YOU
ADDING ITEMS,

04:03.475 --> 04:07.211
BUT I'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN,
PLEASE DON'T CROSS OFF VEGETABLES.

04:10.098 --> 04:11.949
SORRY, I-I GOT UPSET.

04:12.017 --> 04:13.785
IT'S OK.

04:13.852 --> 04:15.753
ALL RIGHT,
AND HELP ME OUT HERE.

04:15.821 --> 04:17.387
IT SAYS CRACKERS-ALL.

04:17.456 --> 04:19.290
THAT'S AN ENTIRE AISLE.

04:19.357 --> 04:22.727
THAT'S JUST A GUIDELINE. I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE FUN WITH IT, JUST GET IN THERE-

04:22.795 --> 04:24.779
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T
YOU JUST COME WITH ME.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.581
THE SAMPLE LADY

04:26.648 --> 04:28.616
OH, I WANT TO.

04:28.684 --> 04:30.685

04:33.371 --> 04:36.540
YEAH, IT'S FINE
IF YOU'RE A BEE GEE.

04:36.608 --> 04:38.259
HONEY, PLEASE,

04:38.326 --> 04:41.395
CARRIE, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO? I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT!

04:41.463 --> 04:45.400

04:46.935 --> 04:48.969
<i>GREAT.</i>

04:58.263 --> 05:01.166

MORE BAGS IN THE CAR.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.368
OH, DANNY!

05:06.038 --> 05:08.606
WE NEED TO SET UP
SOME BOUNDARIES.

05:10.542 --> 05:14.562
HEY... WHY'D YOUR HAIR
TASTE LIKE COCONUT?

05:14.630 --> 05:17.081
I SPILLED A PIÃ‘A COLADA.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.085
WHERE'S DOUG?

05:21.153 --> 05:23.187
HE WENT TO GET
HIS HAIR CUT.

05:23.255 --> 05:24.255
OH, RIGHT.

05:24.322 --> 05:26.240
HEY, CAR, BY THE WAY,

05:26.275 --> 05:29.593
COULD YOU GIVE ME THE
NAME OF DOUG'S HAIR PERSON?

05:29.661 --> 05:32.163
I LOVE HIS LOOK.

05:32.231 --> 05:33.381
UM...

05:33.449 --> 05:35.916
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHO HE GOES TO NOW.

05:35.984 --> 05:39.137
WAIT A MINUTE. DID HE
TELL YOU NOT TO TELL ME?

05:39.205 --> 05:40.805
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

05:40.873 --> 05:42.973
I'M TALKING ABOUT
HIS HOT HAIRDRESSER.

05:44.342 --> 05:46.878
WHAT HOT HAIRDRESSER?

05:46.945 --> 05:49.113
OH, LIKE YOU
DON'T KNOW!

05:51.950 --> 05:54.535
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.258
SO, YOU EVER DELIVER
TO ANYONE FAMOUS?

06:01.326 --> 06:03.944
UH... IS HARRISON FORD
FAMOUS?

06:04.012 --> 06:06.564
<i>YOU DID NOT DELIVER
TO HIM!</i>

06:06.631 --> 06:08.799
NO, I DIDN'T.
BUT HE IS FAMOUS.

06:10.019 --> 06:11.286
SERIOUSLY...

06:14.556 --> 06:16.274
DELIVERING AN OLD LADY
HER HEART MEDICINE

06:16.342 --> 06:18.376
OR A CHILD HIS FIRST BIKE...

06:18.443 --> 06:20.544
THAT'S THE THRILL RIDE

06:20.612 --> 06:22.280
TCH! AW!

06:22.347 --> 06:25.116

STREET AT THE BEAUTY SUPPLY,

06:47.072 --> 06:49.474
THOUGHT I'D JUST POP IN
AND SAY HELLO.

06:49.541 --> 06:52.143
BEAUTY SUPPLY? WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE
THAT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT?

06:52.210 --> 06:54.145
'CAUSE YOU DON'T! HA HA!

06:54.212 --> 06:55.613
I'LL SEE YA AT HOME, OK?

06:55.681 --> 06:57.381
THAT'S OK.
I DON'T MIND WAITING.

06:57.449 --> 06:58.649
THAT'S OK-
I DON'T MIND.

06:58.717 --> 07:00.118
IT'S OK.

07:00.185 --> 07:02.120
I'LL JUST SIT

07:04.289 --> 07:06.791
SO, YOU MUST HAVE
A MILLION FUNNY STORIES

07:06.858 --> 07:10.260
ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHILE
YOU'RE OUT MAKIN' DELIVERIES.

07:10.328 --> 07:11.745
UH... IT'S NOT ABOUT
BEING FUNNY.

07:11.813 --> 07:14.682
IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE JOB
DONE AND GOING HOME TO MY WIFE.

07:16.585 --> 07:18.535
OH. OK.

07:27.679 --> 07:30.181

OK, WELL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

07:46.565 --> 07:49.267

THANK GOD THAT'S DONE.

08:01.613 --> 08:06.300
HEY. COULD YOU PUT 20 BUCKS

08:09.071 --> 08:10.738
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

08:10.806 --> 08:13.024
NO, NO. I'D BE HAPPY
TO DO THAT FOR YOU,

08:13.091 --> 08:14.725
MR. ADAM WEST,

BATMAN?

08:17.362 --> 08:19.480
YOU NAILED ME.

08:19.547 --> 08:22.216
SO, UH, WHAT BRINGS

08:22.284 --> 08:25.586
UNDERGROUND TROUBLE

I HAVE A COLONOSCOPY

EXPO'S COMING UP.

08:34.345 --> 08:37.815
YEAH. THEY'RE HAVING IT AT
THE MEADOWLANDS THIS YEAR.

08:37.883 --> 08:38.982
I REMEMBER WHEN
THEY HELD THE FIRST ONE

08:39.049 --> 08:42.086
IN GEORGE TAKEl'S
LANDLADY'S HOUSE.

08:42.153 --> 08:44.555
TO HAVE BEEN A FLY

08:44.623 --> 08:46.724
OH, THERE WERE
QUITE A FEW OF THOSE.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.527
SHE WAS A FILTHY WOMAN.

08:50.595 --> 08:52.246
WELL, NICE TO TALK TO YOU.

08:55.517 --> 08:57.485
BATMAN?

08:57.552 --> 08:58.920
YES?

09:00.555 --> 09:01.956
THAT IS SO COOL.

09:02.024 --> 09:04.826
UM... I WAS
WONDERING, UH...

09:04.893 --> 09:08.896
ANY CHANCE YOU WOULD COME

09:08.963 --> 09:11.532
OH, I DON'T DO MUCH
OF THOSE ANYMORE,

09:11.599 --> 09:14.635
BUT YOU'VE SURE GOT GUTS
TO ASK ME.

09:14.703 --> 09:18.238
AND I LIKE GUTS.

09:19.074 --> 09:20.925
SO YOU'LL GO?

09:20.992 --> 09:22.343
YOU MAY HAVE TO DRIVE.

09:22.410 --> 09:25.179
MY PRIUS IS IN THE SHOP.

09:32.453 --> 09:33.137
HEY!

09:33.204 --> 09:34.421
HEY. WHERE YOU BEEN?

09:34.489 --> 09:36.123
I'VE BEEN HOME,
UH, AN HOUR NOW.

09:36.191 --> 09:38.126
OH, HAD TO MAKE
A COUPLE STOPS.

09:38.193 --> 09:40.194
GOT YOU THOSE MINTS

09:40.262 --> 09:42.864
AND, UH,

09:45.917 --> 09:47.785
WOW! IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

09:47.852 --> 09:49.654
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

09:49.721 --> 09:51.656

09:53.158 --> 09:56.210
YOU ARE SO SWEET!

09:56.277 --> 09:58.879
LET ME GET A LOOK
AT THAT HAIRCUT.

09:58.947 --> 10:01.582
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
SHE'S GOOD.

10:01.649 --> 10:04.484
YEAH. I MEAN, I WISH
SHE'D DO A LITTLE LESS...

10:04.552 --> 10:08.089
AND A LITTLE MORE...
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

10:08.156 --> 10:09.556
YEAH. SHE'S PRETTY HOT,

10:16.115 --> 10:17.815
TRY ON YOUR
BRACELET.

10:17.882 --> 10:18.882
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE!

10:18.950 --> 10:20.217
WHAT?

10:20.285 --> 10:23.120
SNEAKING AROUND BEHIND
MY BACK GETTING HAIRCUTS!

10:23.188 --> 10:25.439
I WASN'T SNEAKING AROUND. I
TOLD YOU I WAS GETTING A HAIRCUT!

10:25.506 --> 10:28.259
YEAH, BUT NOT BY
EDWARD SCISSORBOOBS!

10:30.262 --> 10:32.379
SO SHE'S A LITTLE HOT,
ALL RIGHT?

10:32.447 --> 10:35.215
I ONLY GO TO HER BECAUSE I
LIKE THE WAY SHE CUTS MY HAIR.

10:35.283 --> 10:35.983
OH, COME ON.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.337
WE BOTH KNOW YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE CRAP.

10:39.404 --> 10:40.538
AND IF IT'S
ABOUT THE HAIRCUT,

10:40.606 --> 10:42.973
WHY WON'T YOU GIVE
HER NUMBER TO DANNY?

10:43.041 --> 10:44.408
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SO UPSET ABOUT?

10:44.476 --> 10:46.143
I'LL TELL DANNY
RIGHT NOW!

10:46.211 --> 10:47.395
GO 'HEAD!

10:47.463 --> 10:48.612
FINE.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.214
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:54.886 --> 10:57.355
IT'S RINGING.

10:57.422 --> 10:59.690
SPENCE, GET DANNY.

10:59.757 --> 11:01.025
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.028
HEY, DANNY, IF YOU
REALLY WANNA KNOW

11:04.096 --> 11:06.663
THE NUMBER TO MY HAIR GIRL,
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

11:06.731 --> 11:08.699
JUST GRAB A PEN, BUD.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.903
<i>FOR THE BROTHERS GRIMM,
PRESS ONE.</i>

11:15.440 --> 11:18.309
WHAT'S WITH THAT GUY,
HUH? "PRESS ONE!"

11:18.377 --> 11:20.544
YOU'RE BEING PATHETIC.

11:20.611 --> 11:23.147
WHAT? SO ONCE A MONTH
I GET MY HAIR CUT

11:23.214 --> 11:24.982
BY A CUTE GIRL
WHO LAUGHS AT MY JOKES.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.383
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

11:26.451 --> 11:28.252
THE BIG DEAL IS
WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED,

11:28.320 --> 11:30.287
YOU TOOK A SACRED VOW
TO ME.

11:30.355 --> 11:33.540
TO DO WHAT, ONLY GET MY
HAIR CUT BY UGLY PEOPLE?

11:33.608 --> 11:36.260
THE POINT IS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE NEEDING

11:36.327 --> 11:38.563
THAT KIND OF ATTENTION
FROM ANYBODY BUT YOUR WIFE.

11:38.630 --> 11:40.865
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW HURTFUL THAT IS TO ME?

11:40.933 --> 11:43.000
YES! THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU!

11:45.737 --> 11:48.939
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? FROM NOW
ON, YOU AND HER, YOU'RE THROUGH.

11:49.007 --> 11:50.758
IF ANYBODY'S GONNA GIVE
YOU PLEASURE ONCE A MONTH,

11:50.826 --> 11:52.225
IT'S GONNA BE ME.

12:00.435 --> 12:01.435
HEY, LOU.

12:01.502 --> 12:02.769
HEY, GUYS.

12:02.838 --> 12:05.372
HEY, LOU.
LOT OF WEIGHT THERE.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.574
YEAH, I'M TRAINING
FOR THE CONVENTION.

12:07.642 --> 12:09.827
I'M GONNA BE IN
THE BEST SHAPE OF MY LIFE.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.015
AT FIRST, HE DIDN'T
EVEN WANT TO GO,

12:14.082 --> 12:15.449
NOW HE'S
TOTALLY INTO IT.

12:15.517 --> 12:18.085
LOOK AT HIM
TRAINING, DEAC.

12:18.153 --> 12:20.371
TRAINING FOR ME
TO BREAK HIS HEART.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.606
THEN WHY'D YOU ASK
THAT OTHER GUY?

12:22.673 --> 12:24.708
BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY
IS BATMAN, ALL RIGHT?

12:24.776 --> 12:25.742
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE

12:25.810 --> 12:27.945
TO TAKE THE DARK KNIGHT
TO A PARTY,

12:28.012 --> 12:29.380
YOU DO IT.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.149
I WOULD NOT DO WELL
IN YOUR WORLD.

12:32.217 --> 12:34.535
IT'S 2 DATES FOR THE PROM
ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:34.602 --> 12:35.770
YOU HAD 2 DATES
FOR THE PROM?

12:35.837 --> 12:37.838
NO, MY DATE DID.

12:37.906 --> 12:38.889
SHE WANTED TO GO WITH ME,

12:38.957 --> 12:40.524
BUT THEN HER DAD SAID
IF SHE WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE,

12:40.592 --> 12:43.060
SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE
THIS OTHER GUY, SO...

12:43.128 --> 12:44.828
UH-HUH. AND YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

12:44.896 --> 12:46.280
SHE ENDED UP
GOING TO COLLEGE,

12:46.348 --> 12:48.449
SO YOU DO THE MATH.

12:54.789 --> 12:57.058
SO HOW DID YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT HER?

12:57.125 --> 12:58.141
HIS COUSIN RATTED HIM OUT.

12:58.209 --> 12:59.510
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
DOUG DIDN'T EVEN THINK

12:59.578 --> 13:01.311
HE WAS DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.

13:01.379 --> 13:03.113
I MEAN, THIS GIRL
WAS ALL OVER HIM

13:03.181 --> 13:06.216
AND HE WAS
FREAKING LOVING IT.

13:06.284 --> 13:08.302
A LITTLE LOWER, BABY.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.887
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S IT.

13:09.954 --> 13:10.921
HEY, DON'T GET
TOO COMFORTABLE.

13:10.989 --> 13:12.556
WE STILL GOT CARDIO.

13:12.624 --> 13:13.891
HATE YOU.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.081
WHAT?

13:20.148 --> 13:22.032
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE HARD ON DOUG?

13:22.100 --> 13:25.802
'CAUSE... YOU KNOW.

13:25.870 --> 13:30.424
THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

13:30.491 --> 13:32.960
OOH, STOP THAT.
THAT TICKLES. HA HA!

13:40.685 --> 13:41.952
MORNING.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.587
HEY.

13:43.654 --> 13:45.189
WHAT YOU MAKING?
SOME WAFFLES?

13:45.256 --> 13:46.690
YEAH.

13:46.757 --> 13:48.692
OH, I'M USING
MRS. BUTTERWORTH'S.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.961
IS THAT OK? OR SHOULD
I ONLY BE GETTING

13:51.029 --> 13:52.829
SYRUP FROM YOUR HEAD?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.688
IS THIS ABOUT THAT WHOLE
HAIR-CUTTING THING?

14:00.755 --> 14:02.690
WELL, UM...
YEAH, LISTEN,

14:02.757 --> 14:05.292
YOU CAN GO BACK TO LORI
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

14:05.359 --> 14:06.093
WHAT?

14:06.244 --> 14:07.277
YOU WERE YELLING AT ME,

14:07.345 --> 14:09.814
SAYING I'M BETRAYING
OUR WHOLE MARRIAGE.

14:09.881 --> 14:11.698
YEAH, I WAS JUST PROBABLY-
I WAS IN A MOOD, YOU KNOW?

14:11.767 --> 14:14.534
JUST SOME WOMANLY STUFF
GOING ON THERE.

14:14.602 --> 14:15.652
BUT SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

14:15.720 --> 14:17.838
YOU CAN GO BACK TO HER.

14:17.905 --> 14:20.140
WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY
OK WITH THIS?

14:20.208 --> 14:21.558
OK, LOOK, I REALIZED

14:21.626 --> 14:23.393
THAT I WAS BEING
A BIT OF A HYPOCRITE.

14:23.461 --> 14:24.895
I MEAN...

14:24.963 --> 14:26.613
I HAVE A MAN IN MY LIFE
WHO'S KIND OF LIKE LORI.

14:26.681 --> 14:28.482
YOU KNOW, GIVES ME ATTENTION,
MAKES ME FEEL GOOD,

14:28.549 --> 14:30.117
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT HIM.

14:33.971 --> 14:37.541
IT'S DEACON, ISN'T IT?

14:37.609 --> 14:40.094
NO, IT'S BRAD,
MY TRAINER FROM THE GYM.

14:40.161 --> 14:41.294
OH. OK, FINE.

14:41.362 --> 14:44.464
YEAH, SO, I'M GONNA
SEE HIM IN 10 MINUTES.

14:44.532 --> 14:46.333
OH. THAT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

14:46.400 --> 14:49.136
MY SIDEBURNS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE BUSHY, TOO.

14:49.204 --> 14:51.672
OK.

14:51.740 --> 14:52.889
WELL, SAY HI TO LORI.

14:52.957 --> 14:53.490
HA HA! SAY HI TO BRAD.

14:53.558 --> 14:54.675
OK, THANKS.

14:54.742 --> 14:56.076
BYE.

15:06.821 --> 15:07.688
HEY, LORI.

15:07.755 --> 15:10.057
OH, HEY, DOUG.

15:10.124 --> 15:13.694
HEY, DOUG.

15:13.761 --> 15:14.761
WHAT'S UP?

15:14.913 --> 15:17.615
I- I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU COULD MAYBE

15:17.682 --> 15:19.883
GIVE ME A LITTLE TRIM IN THE
BACK, CLEAN ME UP A LITTLE BIT.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.485
OH, ACTUALLY,
I WAS ABOUT TO HEAD OUT.

15:21.553 --> 15:24.254
DANNY HAD AN EXTRA TICKET
TO BLUE MAN GROUP.

15:25.673 --> 15:26.924
HEY, YOU FEEL
LIKE MEXICAN?

15:26.992 --> 15:28.759
I LOVE MEXICAN!

15:28.827 --> 15:29.827
OH, GREAT.

15:29.894 --> 15:31.595
OOH, BUT I SHOULD
WARN YOU.

15:31.663 --> 15:33.130
WHEN IT COMES
TO MARGARITAS,

15:33.198 --> 15:34.298
I'M A LIGHTWEIGHT.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.102
<i>HEY, THAT'S BUENO BY ME.</i>

15:39.871 --> 15:41.155
OH, BUT
DON'T WORRY, DOUG,

15:41.223 --> 15:42.306
I'LL GET YOU
TAKEN CARE OF.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.940
EUGENE!

15:44.008 --> 15:45.326
NO, NO. THAT'S OK.
REALLY, THAT'S FINE.

15:45.393 --> 15:46.693
I'M GOOD.

15:46.761 --> 15:48.912
SO DO YOU EVER DELIVER
TO ANYONE FAMOUS?

16:03.427 --> 16:05.395
HEY, SPENCE.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.281
YEAH. HI.
LOU, THERE'S SOMETHING

16:07.348 --> 16:07.998
I REALLY GOT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

16:08.066 --> 16:09.617
LOOK, WHAT
I JUST PICKED UP

16:09.684 --> 16:11.184
AT THE DRY CLEANERS
TODAY.

16:11.252 --> 16:13.287
AND GUESS WHAT,

16:13.354 --> 16:14.588
I'M GOING GREEN.

16:14.656 --> 16:16.624
JUST WAIT HERE. I'M
GONNA GO TRY THEM ON.

16:18.859 --> 16:21.128
DON'T PUT
THE PANTS ON, LOU!

16:21.195 --> 16:22.630
WHY NOT?

16:22.697 --> 16:25.599
'CAUSE IT'S JUST GONNA
MAKE THIS HURT EVEN MORE.

16:30.838 --> 16:33.173
14, 15.

16:33.241 --> 16:34.608
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
FINISH OUT STRONG.

16:34.675 --> 16:35.709
OK.
THERE WE GO.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.645
HEY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

16:38.713 --> 16:40.314
WE GOT
2 MORE SETS HERE.

16:40.382 --> 16:42.366
HEY, JIMMY NEUTRON,
COULD YOU TAKE A WALK?

16:44.135 --> 16:45.602
I'M GONNA GET A RED BULL. YOU WANT ONE?

16:45.670 --> 16:46.904
YEAH, SURE.

16:46.971 --> 16:48.005
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:48.073 --> 16:49.540
WELL, I GOT MY HAIR CUT.

16:49.607 --> 16:50.841
YEAH?

16:50.909 --> 16:53.793
BY EUGENE!
YEAH. LORI COULDN'T DO IT

16:53.861 --> 16:55.162
BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO BUSY
HAVING MARGARITAS WITH DANNY

16:55.230 --> 16:57.597
BECAUSE YOU GAVE HIM
HER NUMBER!

16:57.665 --> 16:59.983
OH. I'M SORRY, BABY.

17:00.051 --> 17:02.118
WELL, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS AT HOME, OK?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.753
RIGHT NOW, BRAD'S
GONNA WORK ON MY GLUTES.

17:04.821 --> 17:07.273
HA HA. NO, NO.
OK, IF I DON'T HAVE LORI,

17:07.342 --> 17:08.509
THERE'S NO BRAD FOR YOU.

17:08.577 --> 17:12.212
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES,
IT'S JUST THIS.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.432
WELL, NO,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

17:15.499 --> 17:17.101
I KNOW. IT SUCKS
FOR BOTH OF US.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.369
DOUG, JUST CALM DOWN, ALL
RIGHT? WE CAN FIX THIS.

17:19.438 --> 17:20.119
HOW?

17:25.041 --> 17:26.476
THIS IS STUPID.

17:26.544 --> 17:28.478
DOUG, COME ON.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.063
I WANT TO FIND YOU
A NEW HAIRDRESSER.

17:30.131 --> 17:32.165
A REAL HOTTIE.

17:34.018 --> 17:35.435
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

17:35.503 --> 17:37.170
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

17:37.238 --> 17:40.173
SHORT? TALL? SKINNY?
A LITTLE JUNK IN THE TRUNK?

17:40.241 --> 17:42.776
WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE?

17:46.147 --> 17:47.715
THAT ONE'S NOT BAD.

17:47.782 --> 17:49.967
OH, I SEE YOU LIKE 'EM
A LITTLE DIRTY.

17:50.034 --> 17:51.518
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT-

17:51.586 --> 17:52.436
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

17:52.504 --> 17:56.973
JUST GO UP TO HER
AND SEE IF SHE'S FREE, OK?

17:57.041 --> 17:58.108
I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:58.175 --> 17:59.109
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT?

17:59.176 --> 18:00.176
NO, I-I'LL DO IT.

18:00.244 --> 18:01.412
OK.

18:04.449 --> 18:05.783
AHEM.

18:05.850 --> 18:06.316
YES?

18:06.384 --> 18:08.569
HEY, I'M DOUG.

18:08.636 --> 18:10.004
UH, I KNOW THIS IS
KIND OF SHORT NOTICE,

18:10.071 --> 18:11.705
BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD GIVE ME A HAIR CUT

18:11.772 --> 18:12.840
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I GO CRAZY.

18:12.908 --> 18:15.242
BUT JUST SEEING IF
YOU WERE AVAILABLE.

18:15.309 --> 18:17.444
ACTUALLY, I'M BOOKED
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

18:17.512 --> 18:18.829
OHH. THAT'S COOL.

18:18.896 --> 18:20.497
I'M SO BUSY, TOO.
I PROBABLY-

18:20.565 --> 18:23.133
I'LL JUST LET IT
GROW, YOU KNOW?

18:23.201 --> 18:24.234
I WANT TO DIE.

18:24.302 --> 18:25.402
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

18:25.470 --> 18:26.737
COME ON. JUST GIVE IT
ANOTHER MINUTE, OK?

18:26.805 --> 18:27.738
LET'S JUST LOOK-

18:27.806 --> 18:29.089
EXCUSE ME.

18:29.156 --> 18:30.624
I WANT HER.

18:34.662 --> 18:35.996
YOU SURE, HONEY? YOU
WANT TO LOOK AROUND-

18:36.063 --> 18:37.898
YEAH, YOU CAN GO HOME.
I'LL GET A RIDE OR SOMETHING.

18:41.836 --> 18:44.271
I'M GLAD YOUR PRIUS
IS OUT OF THE SHOP

18:44.339 --> 18:46.773
'CAUSE THIS
IS A SWEET RIDE.

18:46.841 --> 18:49.409
I MAY BUY IT WHEN
THE LEASE IS UP.

18:51.346 --> 18:54.014
SO, ANYWAY, UM,

18:54.082 --> 18:55.148
WE WANT TO MAKE
A REALLY GOOD ENTRANCE,

18:55.216 --> 18:57.584
SO I WAS THINKING YOU COULD
EITHER RAPPEL DOWN NEXT TO ME

18:57.651 --> 19:00.353
OR YOU CARRY ME IN YOUR
ARMS AND SET ME DOWN.

19:00.422 --> 19:02.005
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR CALL.

19:02.073 --> 19:05.075
LET'S PLAY IT BY EAR.

19:05.143 --> 19:08.845
OH, SPENCE, I RAN INTO
A MUTUAL FRIEND TODAY.

19:08.913 --> 19:10.447
OH, WHO?
COMMISSIONER GORDON?

19:10.515 --> 19:12.816
HA HA HA!

19:12.884 --> 19:15.152
HE'S BEEN DEAD
SINCE 1984.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.487
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

19:17.555 --> 19:22.075
I'M TALKING ABOUT
LOU FERRIGNO.

19:22.143 --> 19:24.177
OH, YEAH?

19:24.245 --> 19:25.312
LOU TOLD ME

19:25.379 --> 19:26.679
THAT HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO

19:26.747 --> 19:27.915
TO THE CONVENTION
WITH YOU,

19:27.982 --> 19:31.684
BUT YOU DITCHED HIM
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

19:31.752 --> 19:34.604
BECAUSE YOU'RE BETTER!

19:34.639 --> 19:36.824
OH, I SEE.

19:36.891 --> 19:38.342
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

19:38.409 --> 19:40.610
IF YOU HAD RUN INTO BILL
SHATNER THIS MORNING,

19:40.678 --> 19:43.981
WOULD YOU HAVE
DITCHED ME, TOO?

19:44.048 --> 19:47.717
I WANT TO SAY NO, BUT...

19:47.785 --> 19:51.688
I'M WEAK. I'M SO WEAK.

19:51.756 --> 19:52.706
WELL, THAT'S WHY

19:52.857 --> 19:55.859
PEOPLE LIKE LOU, MYSELF,
BILL, LEE MAJORS

19:55.926 --> 19:58.695
ALWAYS LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

19:58.763 --> 20:02.916
BECAUSE OF PASTY-FACED
OPPORTUNISTS LIKE YOU.

20:05.753 --> 20:08.788
W- W-WE'RE STILL GOING,
RIGHT?

20:08.856 --> 20:09.973
I AM.

20:11.943 --> 20:13.443
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.879
W- W-WE'RE ON THE TURNPIKE!

20:15.947 --> 20:18.481
I GOTTA RUN ACROSS
4 LANES OF TRAFFIC!

20:18.549 --> 20:21.568
CHARACTER IS FORMED
THROUGH ADVERSITY.

20:21.636 --> 20:25.706
AND P.S., I'M KEEPING
YOUR GAS MONEY.

20:38.569 --> 20:40.003
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:40.070 --> 20:42.506
I HEARD YOU HAVE
A HOT HAIRDRESSER.

20:42.573 --> 20:44.608
WE WANT IN.
