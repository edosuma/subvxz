WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.772
(indistinct conversations)

00:17.183 --> 00:18.584
Lieutenant hughes?

00:19.252 --> 00:20.452
You got a suspect
for me, I believe.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.221
We are bringing him in now.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.156
Felony auto theft, right?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.258
Your lab sent
this file over.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.361
Some kid totaled
councilman hawk's new bmw?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.130
<i>You</i> got a political one.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.232
Jacob baker.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.467
Jacob baker?

00:35.469 --> 00:37.669
Isn't he the guy that
csi stokes brought in for

00:37.671 --> 00:39.605
Pointing lasers
at airplanes?

00:39.607 --> 00:42.241
I thought nick had scared him
straight, but I guess not.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.576
All right, tell the councilman
he can rest easy.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.779
We will get <i>justice</i>
<i>for his beemer.</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:48.213
Hughes:
Thanks for bringing
him in, blake.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.115
No problem.
Headed back out on patrol.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.116
Change of plans.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.785
I cleared it
with your sergeant.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.621
I need you to cover dolan
at the reception desk.

00:55.623 --> 00:58.624
You know how I <i>love</i>
<i>taking orders from you.</i>

00:58.626 --> 01:00.092
Am I going to have to report you

01:00.094 --> 01:02.694
For insubordination,
officer hughes?

01:02.696 --> 01:06.365
Go ahead. I'll claim sexual
harassment, lieutenant hughes.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.267
Russell:
Guys, get a room.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.768
Oh, that's right, you don't have
to, you're already married.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.170
(chuckles)

01:11.172 --> 01:12.571
So, tell me about the kid.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.539
Give you any trouble?

01:13.541 --> 01:14.840
No. Seemed like a mama's boy.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.108
You should talk.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.077
See what I have to
put up with?
Ooh.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.351
Sir, I am connecting you to
detective crawford right now.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.387
Cavalry's arrived.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.756
What did you do to your wife
to deserve this?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.224
Just taking one for the team.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.492
Well, it's all yours.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.760
I'm going to need you
to fill out your name

01:34.762 --> 01:36.328
In the top box there,

01:36.330 --> 01:38.664
And then
your home address

01:38.666 --> 01:41.233
Goes in the box
right below that.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.435
Okay, who's next?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.270
Please step up
to the counter.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.173
Hey, kid, what do you
think you're doing?!

01:48.175 --> 01:49.708
Son, you got to wait
your turn.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.113
Hey! Did you <i>hear</i> me?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.152
(people exclaiming)

02:00.154 --> 02:01.753
Just relax, all right?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.322
Just take it easy.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.224
(gunshot echoes,
casing clatters to floor)

02:05.226 --> 02:08.227
(distant screaming,
blake sighs)

02:08.229 --> 02:09.695
(sputters)

02:09.697 --> 02:11.363
Man:
Go, go!

02:11.365 --> 02:13.632
(woman whimpers)

02:16.202 --> 02:18.370
(whimpers)

02:18.372 --> 02:19.571
(gunshot, casing clatters)

02:19.573 --> 02:21.640
(panicked shouting)

02:24.477 --> 02:26.378
(woman sobbing)

02:26.880 --> 02:29.148
(casing clattering)

02:32.619 --> 02:34.853
(officer grunts,
distant screaming)

02:36.523 --> 02:40.225
(gunshot, casing clattering)

02:42.262 --> 02:44.196
(panicked shouts)

02:49.502 --> 02:52.171
Man:
He's got another gun!

02:56.276 --> 02:57.709
(woman sobs)

03:09.622 --> 03:12.457
(woman sobs)

03:13.760 --> 03:16.195
(rapid gunshots)

03:16.197 --> 03:18.263
Man:
Hold your fire!
Russell's in there!

03:18.265 --> 03:19.598
(panting)
okay.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.632
Okay, easy.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.301
(groans)
just take it easy.

03:23.269 --> 03:25.504

03:37.218 --> 03:40.319

04:02.575 --> 04:04.309
Paula francis (on tv):
...Desert palm hospital.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.478
Our understanding is
the <i>shooter</i> has now

04:06.480 --> 04:07.746
Barricaded <i>himself</i>

04:07.748 --> 04:09.548
Inside an interrogation room

04:09.550 --> 04:10.949
And is holding hostages.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.651
No word yet on whether or not
what the hell's going on?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.419
There are any casualties.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.954
It looks really bad.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.589
Guys, I just got off
the phone with brass.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.757
Russell is in the room

04:18.759 --> 04:20.659
With the shooter.
What?!

04:20.661 --> 04:21.927
They haven't been able
to make contact with him.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.029
They're still
securing the building.
Okay.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.464
Well, the best
thing we can do

04:25.466 --> 04:26.932
For everyone right
now, is our jobs.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.934
So, greg, you want to head over
to pd with me right now,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.402
See what's going on?
Yeah. Sure.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.404
I'll go to the hospital,
collect evidence.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.506
I'll run things
from here.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.542
(man shouts orders)

04:37.544 --> 04:40.779
...The generators
are good to go.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.615
All men in position!
Weapons high!

04:43.617 --> 04:46.785
(gun clicking)

04:46.787 --> 04:48.520
Brass: Mr. Mayor,
all I can tell you now,

04:48.522 --> 04:51.423
Is I have one officer dead
and four others wounded.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.958
It   <i>seem</i>like the shooter

04:52.960 --> 04:53.959
Was targeting police officers.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.294
We're clearing the building now.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.428
I'll call you back
when I know more.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.597
Sir, you wanted to see me?

04:59.766 --> 05:02.401
Lieutenant hughes,
I saw the wounded list.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.670
Your husband's on it.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.038
(whispering):
Oh, my god.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.673
He was at the front desk
when the shooter came in.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.041
I know.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.542
(trembling):
<i>I'm</i> the one who put him there.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.045
How bad is he?

05:13.047 --> 05:14.680
You should go to the hospital.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.882
But...

05:16.884 --> 05:17.883
No. Go. Go. Debbie, go.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.485
Go. We got this covered. Go.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.421
Where's that camera feed
from interrogation?!

05:22.423 --> 05:24.489
It goes directly into
the observation room.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.326
I need eyes on that room!
Yes, sir.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.061
(phone ringing)

05:29.063 --> 05:30.429
(jacob yells)

05:30.431 --> 05:32.531
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!
Back against the wall!

05:32.533 --> 05:36.001
Jacob: What the hell, man?!
Why'd you shoot me?!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.703
Teen: I didn't shoot you,
I don't even know you.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.904
Everyone just shut up!

05:38.906 --> 05:40.539
(groans)

05:40.541 --> 05:41.540
What happened,
did you get hit?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.375
Man!
Cops are firing rounds

05:43.377 --> 05:45.477
In this room, you probably
caught one the same time he did.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.912
Probably cracked a rib.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.547
(groans)

05:48.549 --> 05:50.382
(phone continues ringing)

05:50.384 --> 05:51.650
You're gonna have to let me
answer the phone.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.085
I told you, no.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.420
Let me, let me tell you
how this works.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.722
If I don't answer this
pretty soon...

05:56.724 --> 05:57.889
(phone continues ringing)

05:57.891 --> 05:59.391
...Cops are gonna think
I'm dead.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.427
And then it's not gonna just
be a couple of rounds.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.730
They're gonna
light this place up.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.565
Well, maybe that's what I want.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.669
You think I didn't know
I was gonna die today?

06:11.437 --> 06:12.437
(computer trilling)

06:12.439 --> 06:15.107
Hey, did you talk to russell?

06:15.109 --> 06:18.443
Yeah. Well, radio silence
usually means one thing:

06:18.445 --> 06:19.478
Guy's not giving up.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.846
If your csi's still alive,

06:20.848 --> 06:23.615
Best chance to save him...
Tactical entry.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.051
That is a negative.
We're not there yet, dolan.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.855
And when we are, it's
gonna be too late.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.022
Yeah, and if we go in too early,
everybody gets killed,

06:31.024 --> 06:32.023
So why don't you just...

06:32.025 --> 06:34.760
Be cool right now,
all right?

06:36.095 --> 06:37.863
God, it's friggin' cold
in here, man.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.565
He needs a doctor.
He's all right.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.401
(struggling):
Oh, yeah... G-g-great.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.403
I'm gonna take a look at him.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.406
Listen, you know, I don't
know what your deal is.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.442
I don't know why you thought
you had to do this,

06:50.444 --> 06:51.843
But it has nothing to
do with jacob here.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.813
You're in charge.
Besides, you know something,

06:54.815 --> 06:56.481
I don't, I don't think
you want to see him suffer

06:56.483 --> 06:58.784
Any more than he has.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.918
Do you?

07:02.488 --> 07:03.755
All right. Mm.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.124
(panting)

07:06.126 --> 07:07.659
Jacob, you're not
gonna like this.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.927
(groans)

07:08.929 --> 07:10.929
Ready? Here we go.
(screaming)

07:10.931 --> 07:13.832
That's good, buddy.
There you go.
Was that really necessary?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.134
Lean forward here.
I'm going to...

07:16.136 --> 07:18.603
(short rapid whimpering)
come on. Okay.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.138
(groaning)
well, you know what?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.573
You are a very...

07:21.575 --> 07:23.508
Very lucky boy.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.610
How is getting shot
being "lucky"?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.946
Well, uh, because... (grunts)
(groans)

07:27.948 --> 07:29.915
The bullet went
straight through,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.717
So all we have to do is
stop the bleeding here.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.619
(jacob groans)

07:34.621 --> 07:35.587
Here we go.
(groans)

07:35.589 --> 07:36.721
All right. All right.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.056
(jacob groans)
give me your hand.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.157
Give me your hand.
(groaning, whimpering)

07:39.159 --> 07:40.859
You're doing great.
Jacob: Oh...!

07:40.861 --> 07:42.627
What's your name, son?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.162
What do you care?

07:44.164 --> 07:47.833
(sighs) it makes for an easier
conversation, that's all.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.635
You first.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.670
My name's russell.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.971
D.B. Russell.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.173
Your turn.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.708
No uniform.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.776
No suit.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.077
No gun.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.812
You're not a cop.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.814
No. I'm a csi.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.716
Is that why
you didn't shoot me?

08:04.718 --> 08:06.685
You got a beef just with cops?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.019
(panting)

08:09.856 --> 08:12.557
(laughs)
c-csi, huh?

08:12.559 --> 08:14.092
Mm-hmm.
Like a science guy?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.528
Yeah.
Makes sense.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.929
Looks like you know
what you're doing.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.264
If you mean,
I know first aid,

08:19.266 --> 08:22.234
Yeah, but that doesn't take away
from the fact that

08:22.236 --> 08:24.970
He needs a doctor.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.705
Brass: <i>How are we doing on</i>
<i>that camera feed?</i>

08:26.707 --> 08:28.173
I think I'm only going to
be able to get your picture.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.541
No sound.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.876
I'll take anything you can get.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.778
(phone ringing)

08:35.648 --> 08:37.182
(phone beeps)
d.B.?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.216
Russell:
Yeah, jim...

08:38.218 --> 08:39.584
Officer:
Captain, I got it.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.753
Russell: We got you on
speakerphone here,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.989
Just so you know.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.257
Brass:
What's your status?

08:45.259 --> 08:47.125
Uh, I think
we're okay...

08:47.127 --> 08:48.627
For the moment.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.195
I do have a young man...

08:50.197 --> 08:52.764
Jacob here, who needs
medical attention.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.566
But our, um,

08:54.568 --> 08:55.634
Our friend with
the gun here,

08:55.636 --> 08:56.768
Is not comfortable

08:56.770 --> 08:58.103
Bringing a doctor in.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.572
Brass: We can get you
anything you need.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.641
Food, water... Medical supplies.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.808
All right.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.944
Okay, I think
we've agreed on that.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.580
So, I guess the young man with
the gun is listening on speaker?

09:08.582 --> 09:11.550
Yeah. I'm here.
What do you want?

09:11.552 --> 09:13.752
Brass: Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.020
What do I want?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.188
Brass:
Yeah. What do you want?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.757
Nothing.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.993
Brass:
What's your name, son?

09:23.062 --> 09:25.096
Yeah. We-we already
tried that, jim.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.698
(sighs)

09:26.700 --> 09:28.700
What do you want?

09:30.036 --> 09:31.736
Maybe one thing...

09:31.738 --> 09:32.871
A laptop.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.612
Any luck recovering
any of the bullets?

09:40.614 --> 09:42.847
I'm working on it.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.783
Any word yet on russell?
He's okay.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.217
He was able to contact brass

09:46.219 --> 09:47.953
And now they have a
direct line of communication

09:47.955 --> 09:49.220
With the gunman.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.756
I found a photo
in officer matsuda's wallet.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.225
Four kids, all boys.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.694
Has the family
been notified yet?

09:55.696 --> 09:56.861
No. I guess they
want to keep a lid

09:56.863 --> 09:57.996
On what goes out
to the public,

09:57.998 --> 09:59.798
In case the gunman is watching.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.032
Meanwhile, his poor family
has no idea

10:01.034 --> 10:02.734
That he's not
coming home tonight.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.737
Looks like a nine millimeter.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.873
With the weapon
we found on the scene.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.141
(metal clinks)
hopefully,

10:10.143 --> 10:11.743
With this bullet
and that weapon,

10:11.745 --> 10:14.012
We'll be able to I.D.
The shooter.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.021
♪

10:31.731 --> 10:33.798
♪

10:35.801 --> 10:37.869
Hughes:
Blake?!

10:38.804 --> 10:39.938
Blake?

10:48.814 --> 10:50.382
Debra?

10:50.384 --> 10:52.083
Hey.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.685
Sara.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.753
Where is he?

10:54.755 --> 10:55.954
Wh-where's blake?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.856
They took him upstairs--
he's in surgery.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.724
So-so he's not...?
No. No. No.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.893
They're working on him
right now, uh...

11:01.895 --> 11:03.862
I'm sure the doctors
will have some news soon.

11:03.864 --> 11:04.996
Why did this happen?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.364
Why now?

11:06.366 --> 11:07.799
I-I was just starting
to think that things

11:07.801 --> 11:09.267
Were gonna be good again.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.703
Blake and I,
we-we've had our struggles...

11:11.705 --> 11:13.705
Both you being on the job...

11:13.707 --> 11:14.906
I know that's not easy.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.441
But that was behind us.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.110
We were ourselves again,
making plans for the future.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.679
And now...

11:20.681 --> 11:21.813
Debbie, you can't believe that.
Not right now.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.148
Okay, blake is gonna
pull through this.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.816
He's gonna come through this.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.785
You have to believe that.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.053
Okay?

11:33.426 --> 11:35.694
(groaning, panting)

11:37.463 --> 11:38.897
The pain's getting worse.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.198
Russell:
Meds will be here
in a second.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.967
You know,
you just need one of us.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.171
True... But

11:46.173 --> 11:48.039
Isn't he more valuable than you?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.974
Being a civilian and all?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.912
Brass:
Okay... All right, well,

11:53.914 --> 11:55.880
We've cleared the building.
(sighs)

11:55.882 --> 11:58.083
And now we need to figure out
a plan to get russell

11:58.085 --> 11:59.217
And the injured kid
out of there.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.819
Yeah, <i>alive.</i>

12:00.821 --> 12:01.853
Yeah, <i>alive.</i>

12:01.855 --> 12:03.722
Sir,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.090
You wanted sound,
I got it for you.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.458
I put a mic inside this
epinephrine injector.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.826
I figure we could
get it to russell

12:07.828 --> 12:09.127
With the rest
of the medical supplies.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.962
Nice work, dunn.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.865
Now, we need to figure out
a way to let russell know

12:13.867 --> 12:16.067
That there's a microphone
implanted in this device.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.903
I can take care of that.

12:24.977 --> 12:28.046
Officer:
Csi sanders is approaching
for transfer!

12:43.095 --> 12:44.229
Officer:
He's got a laser on you.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.931
No sudden moves!

12:49.368 --> 12:50.969
Teen:
Put down the bag

12:50.971 --> 12:53.538
And the laptop.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.910
Put your hands to the sides
and turn around.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.211
Slowly!

13:10.222 --> 13:11.790
I'm not armed.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.291
Just the delivery guy.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.492
What's your plan now?

13:16.929 --> 13:17.862
You can take the delivery.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.134
(panting)

13:33.045 --> 13:34.512
(door closes)

13:37.883 --> 13:39.050
Glad to see you're still
in one piece.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.352
(sighs)
how bad is it?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.088
It's pretty bad.

13:46.559 --> 13:49.561
It's all here:
Food, water... Meds.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.062
Oh, uh,

13:51.064 --> 13:52.997
I grabbed your epinephrine
from your desk.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.838
I'll keep it close by.
Thank you.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.007
Teen:
Hey, what's the hold up?!

14:03.009 --> 14:06.911
No hold up.
I'm coming back in.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.347
Hey, russell.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.150
I'll be back in a while.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.090
Coming in.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.862
(footsteps approaching,
computer trills, beeps)

14:23.864 --> 14:25.096
Hey. You texted me.
You got something?

14:25.098 --> 14:27.098
So, the bullets
that we recovered from

14:27.100 --> 14:30.335
Officer matsuda didn't
provide us anything, but

14:30.337 --> 14:31.502
The shooter dropped a gun

14:31.504 --> 14:32.937
And that's another story.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.906
Gun's been through
a lot of hands.

14:34.908 --> 14:38.176
First, seller and then
seven other sales after that.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.544
Ending up in arizona.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.945
Purchased last year
by mr. Holland walker.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.047
Age 48.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.382
Scottsdale address.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.118
How does mr. Walker's gun,
in arizona,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.253
End up in the hands of a kid

14:48.255 --> 14:50.121
Shooting up lvpd?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.589
Call walker.
See if he has an answer.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.491
(keyboard clicking)

14:56.128 --> 14:57.195
What are you doing?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.163
Looking for yourself
on the news?

15:05.638 --> 15:08.273
Russell:
How you doing here, jacob?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.041
Feeling good, sir.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.376
Actually, I'm not...

15:11.378 --> 15:12.677
I'm not feeling much
of anything.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.012
Well, that's 'cause
you're on some

15:14.014 --> 15:15.647
Pretty good
drugs there, buddy.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.283
I'm just gonna
clean you up here

15:18.285 --> 15:19.584
And you'll be good to go.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.021
Jacob:
Well, you're the doctor.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.155
Hey. Hey.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.090
Hey. Do me a favor, will you?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.959
Give me a hand here.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.227
I'm-I'm not asking you
to put the gun down.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.696
I just need,
I just need a hand.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.064
Give me some water.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.132
Please.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.100
Oh, come on, will you?

15:36.102 --> 15:38.169
You afraid to get your
hands bloody, or something?

15:38.171 --> 15:40.338
Hand me the water.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.573
Come on.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.043
All right.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.078
That was a close one.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.180
Russell knows what he's doing.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.019
What is that medal?
Is that saint christopher?

15:55.021 --> 16:00.191
Well, it just looked like it was
important to you, that's all.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.326
I used to have
one of those.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.127
Good for you.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.562
Easy. Easy. Easy.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.097
(groans, panting)

16:06.099 --> 16:07.065
My wife gave it to me.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.200
She wanted to protect me
at work.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.101
(chuckles)

16:10.103 --> 16:11.602
Who gave you yours?

16:11.604 --> 16:13.671
I told you this whole, "let's
have a conversation thing"

16:13.673 --> 16:15.440
Isn't going to work.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.675
It's gonna make for a
hell of a long evening.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.978
Maybe.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.446
Maybe not.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.214
Jacob:
Come on, dude.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.083
Don't be such a tool.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.185
I'm ju... I'm just saying.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.253
If this was supposed to be
a suicide mission,

16:29.255 --> 16:31.055
Then why aren't you dead?

16:32.124 --> 16:34.092
You know something?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.160
I think you're wondering
the same thing.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.695
I think there's
someone out there

16:37.697 --> 16:39.497
You don't want to hurt.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.265
You know, someone who's
worried about you.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.534
Maybe the same person
who gave you that medal.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.269
I'm thinking you should shut up.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.773
Oh, hell. Uh...

16:48.775 --> 16:50.508
Hold onto this,
just for a second.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.243
Easy, easy.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.145
You all right?

16:55.214 --> 16:57.115
Thank you.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.336
Dunn:
Why's he looking
at us like that?

17:22.107 --> 17:23.775
The water bottle.

17:23.777 --> 17:24.742
What about it?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.144
Get me a screen grab.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.111
Isolate that bottle.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.780
Yes, sir.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.049
(computer whirring, beeping)

17:32.284 --> 17:34.118
Stokes:
Son of a bitch,

17:34.120 --> 17:35.253
He just got us
the guy's prints.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.188
I told you he knew
what he was doing.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.293
Finlay:
Are they good enough to run?

17:42.295 --> 17:45.163
In the right hands... Yes.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.398
This should do it.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.233
We'll see what we got.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.103
(computer whirring)

17:52.105 --> 17:54.138
Finlay:
Mark powell. 16 years old.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.140
16-year-old walks into pd

17:56.142 --> 17:57.508
And starts killing cops.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.243
How does that happen?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.312
Well, his juvie
record's sealed.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.547
Maybe there'll be some
answers in there.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.215
Well, maybe there's
some answers here.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.216
(computer beeps)

18:08.854 --> 18:11.489
Stokes:
That's the kid's mom
right there, cynthia powell.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.757
Does she have any idea
why her son

18:12.759 --> 18:14.225
Might do something
like this?
No.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.595
She talked to brass.
She's still in shock.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.299
Said she doesn't even
own a gun.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.568
Has no clue how her son
would be able to get his hands

18:23.570 --> 18:24.836
On an arsenal like this.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.838
Who's processing their house?
Morgan.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.240
And she also told brass
that the kid used

18:29.242 --> 18:30.775
The family van.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.176
Patrol found it a
couple of blocks from here.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.177
Impound's bringing it in
right now

18:33.179 --> 18:34.545
If you want to
get on that.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.713
Yeah. I will.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.381
Stokes:
All right, good luck.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.554
I'm so sorry.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.889
So are we.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.232
(sighs)

18:57.870 --> 18:59.804
Okay, mrs. Powell, come on,
I want you to have a seat...

18:59.806 --> 19:01.339
(trembling):
Oh, my god! Mark.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.575
Brass:
Mrs. Powell,
come have a seat please.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.410
Okay.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.546
(crying)

19:08.548 --> 19:10.281
I'm gonna ask you
to phone mark.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.516
Now, I know this
is tough, I do,

19:11.518 --> 19:14.485
But I need you to try
to reach out to him.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.688
I don't know what to say to him.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.692
Just remind him
that he's your son,

19:21.694 --> 19:23.427
You know, tell him
that you love him.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.429
And that he has a future

19:25.431 --> 19:27.798
If he will just...

19:27.800 --> 19:29.233
Let these people go

19:29.235 --> 19:31.502
And come home with you.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.837
(whispering):
Okay.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.405
Can you do that?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.541
(voice breaking):
I'll try.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.442
(phone ringing)

19:40.779 --> 19:42.413
(sighs)

19:42.415 --> 19:44.415
Yeah... Yeah,
go ahead, answer it.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.750
Yeah, jim.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.752
Brass:
Well, I assume
that the young man

19:47.754 --> 19:49.554
Is listening over the speaker?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.923
I have someone
who wants to speak with him.

19:51.925 --> 19:54.392
(crying):
Mark, sweetheart,

19:54.394 --> 19:56.460
It's me.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.529
M-m-m-mom?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.797
W-w-what are you doing here?!

19:59.799 --> 20:02.466
The police found me.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.634
What? How?!

20:03.636 --> 20:05.603
It doesn't matter, sweetheart.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.774
You need to let

20:09.776 --> 20:10.641
Those people go.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.410
You've got to stop this.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.247
Mark.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.349
You son of a bitch.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.518
You played me.
You think I'm an idiot...
No. I don't, mark.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.986
I just think you need help,
that's all.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.654
"mark"?!

20:23.656 --> 20:25.590
All right.
You-you got my name,

20:25.592 --> 20:26.724
You found my mother,

20:26.726 --> 20:29.427
But you don't know who I am!

20:29.429 --> 20:30.461
But the world's gonna know,

20:30.463 --> 20:32.430
'cause you know why?!

20:32.432 --> 20:34.465
'cause it's over.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.007
(gunshot)

20:43.009 --> 20:44.709
Officer: Shots fired.
Mark!

20:44.711 --> 20:46.410
I need you to leave.
It's for your own safety.
No!

20:46.412 --> 20:49.981
Officer wincroft, escort
mrs. Powell to an outer office.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.382
What the hell's going on?
I heard a shot.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.383
Dunn:
Still got ears in there,
captain.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.451
What's going on in there?!

20:53.453 --> 20:55.286
Russell:
Mark...
Hey, come on.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.988
Don't do anything
that we're all gonna regret.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.656
I think we're way past that!

20:58.658 --> 21:00.491
Actually, no, we're not,
but we will be.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.827
They're gonna come
busting through that room

21:02.829 --> 21:04.462
And then we're all dead.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.265
Unless you let me
call them off.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.533
What's it gonna be?

21:11.737 --> 21:12.903
Mark?

21:17.876 --> 21:19.810
Jim, we're okay.

21:19.812 --> 21:20.978
Do you copy me?

21:20.980 --> 21:25.316
We just had a little family
disagreement, that's all.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.318
Mark and I
are working it out here.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.587
I'm gonna need a few minutes.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.323
I will call you back.

21:32.325 --> 21:35.359
You and I have nothing to say.
Now sit down.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.761
Sit down, man!

21:36.763 --> 21:38.663
Dolan:
<i>This kid's a time bomb.</i>

21:38.665 --> 21:40.364
Thermal imaging can give us
a heat signature

21:40.366 --> 21:44.368
We could put a .30 cal round
right through the wall.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.704
And what assurance
do we have

21:46.706 --> 21:48.472
That you're gonna target
the right signature?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.441
I agree.
We're not gonna wait
this kid out.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.377
He killed cops! He knows he's
not walking out of here alive!

21:53.379 --> 21:56.947
That nobody's walking
out of there alive. You!
You're the one...

21:56.949 --> 22:01.018
Calm down! Calm down!
The two of you calm down!

22:01.020 --> 22:03.521
That's an order!
Calm down.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.558
Dolan, my heart is with you...

22:08.694 --> 22:11.395
...But my head is with nick.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.864
Now, russell's in there,
and I'm gonna give him a chance

22:13.866 --> 22:15.900
To talk this kid out of there.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.836
But we also need to give csi
a chance to work this case.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.372
The better we know powell,

22:21.374 --> 22:24.608
The better the chances are
to get russell and baker
out of there alive.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.644
You got it?

22:26.646 --> 22:30.081
Sanders:
Powell's mother said
she hadn't seen much of him

22:30.083 --> 22:33.451
The past couple weeks.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.386
Now we know why.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.421
He's been living in here.

22:37.423 --> 22:40.858
The usual smell of teen spirit.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.593
Yeah, and teen angst.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.795
Self-hatred, depression.

22:44.797 --> 22:45.996
Looking at his journal,

22:45.998 --> 22:47.932
I'd say
that he'd be more likely

22:47.934 --> 22:49.533
To commit suicide than homicide.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.669
(camera shutter clicking)

22:56.441 --> 23:00.010
Looks like he found another
outlet for his feelings.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.413
Did his homework, too.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.015
Even downloaded blueprints of
the pd from county archives.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.451
He's been planning this
for a while.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.420
Brody:
But not planning it alone.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.155
Take a look at this.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.991
There are hundreds of e-mails

23:13.993 --> 23:16.527
And im's going back and forth

23:16.529 --> 23:19.797
Between powell and this
user-name lookingglass419.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.633
This e-mail exchange
is from six months ago.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.535
"saw another po-po shooting
on the news.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.570
"homeless guy shot 16 times.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.472
Since when is sleeping
on a bench a crime?"

23:28.474 --> 23:30.674
Powell responds:
"5-0 got no respect."

23:30.676 --> 23:33.878
Lookingglass: "maybe someone
needs to teach 'em some."

23:33.880 --> 23:37.648
Lookingglass talks about
how much he hates the cops,

23:37.650 --> 23:38.749
Powell agrees.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.752
Then lookingglass
suggests a plan

23:41.754 --> 23:43.621
To attack police stations.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.157
Some kind of suicide pact.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.725
Powell is suicidal,

23:47.727 --> 23:49.493
But he wouldn't be able
to do this on his own.

23:49.495 --> 23:50.561
He needs an alpha; someone

23:50.563 --> 23:52.463
To give him
a sense of purpose

23:52.465 --> 23:54.064
And meaning in his life
that he's missing.

23:54.066 --> 23:58.736
This last e-mail exchange
is from ten days ago.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.540
Lookingglass: "it's on.
I selected targets. You in?"

24:02.542 --> 24:06.577
Powell: "bring the pain.
Let them never forget."

24:06.579 --> 24:08.045
Lookingglass:
"I got guns, burner phones.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.215
From now on,
total radio silence."

24:11.217 --> 24:14.452
All right, so we know
powell's part of the plan.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.754
Now what about
lookingglass,

24:16.756 --> 24:19.156
What's his target?
Which police station?

24:19.158 --> 24:24.628
Listen to me now, mrs. Powell.
I think that mark had help

24:24.630 --> 24:25.930
Planning this attack
from somebody,

24:25.932 --> 24:28.132
Somebody who got in his head,
and encouraged him

24:28.134 --> 24:29.667
To do the things
that he's done.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.704
A partner.
There's somebody else out there

24:33.706 --> 24:34.972
Planning an attack.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.674
Maybe an attack
on a police station.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.677
If we can find him,
stop him,

24:39.679 --> 24:42.213
Then maybe he can help us
stop your son.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.948
We found some e-mails.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.551
This partner goes
by the screen name

24:47.553 --> 24:48.986
"lookingglass419."

24:48.988 --> 24:50.921
Does that sound
familiar to you?

24:50.923 --> 24:53.057
No. I'm sorry,
it doesn't.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.592
Not somebody he hangs out with?

24:54.594 --> 24:55.860
A friend of his
from high school?

24:55.862 --> 24:57.561
Anything like that?

24:57.563 --> 24:58.662
A friend?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.065
Mark doesn't
have any friends.

25:03.134 --> 25:04.602
Not since elliot was killed.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.736
Who's elliot?

25:05.738 --> 25:06.971
The neighbor's boy.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.807
But he was more like
a brother to mark.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.243
He spent a lot of time
at our house...

25:12.245 --> 25:15.646
Before he got into drugs.

25:15.648 --> 25:18.616
About a year ago,
elliot robbed
a liquor store.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.917
(voice breaks):
The police cornered him,

25:19.919 --> 25:23.921
They thought he had a gun,
so they shot him.

25:23.923 --> 25:27.725
After elliot was killed,
mark was inconsolable.

25:27.727 --> 25:32.229
You know, that would explain
his e-mails expressing

25:32.231 --> 25:33.664
His hatred
for the police.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.965
Mark said
a lot of stupid things.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.135
He's done a lot
of stupid things now, too,

25:38.137 --> 25:40.271
Hasn't he? I'm familiar
with that juvie record.

25:40.273 --> 25:42.740
He's been arrested
multiple times for

25:42.742 --> 25:44.575
Vandalism, assault...
I know!

25:44.577 --> 25:46.310
You know, and you didn't
do anything about it?

25:46.312 --> 25:47.745
You didn't see the warning signs

25:47.747 --> 25:49.680
That he was capable
of something like this?

25:49.682 --> 25:52.983
I did. I got
him into therapy

25:52.985 --> 25:57.988
I mean, even one of your
own police youth sports camp.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.824
(voice breaks):
Mark started going
to church with me.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.726
We prayed to
saint christopher.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.795
I gave him a medal.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.765
And I told him that every time
he got upset about elliot,

26:07.767 --> 26:09.767
Sad or angry,
that he should pray

26:09.769 --> 26:11.035
Until the anger left him.

26:12.804 --> 26:16.307
I love my son!

26:16.309 --> 26:20.711
I swear, I tried.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.217
Mitch, hi.
Sara.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.652
How you doing?

26:28.654 --> 26:29.753
I've been better.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.189
I just want to get out of here.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.691
Well, it's gonna be
a little while.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.125
You were shot in the stomach.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.795
Did we at least get
the damn shooter?

26:37.797 --> 26:41.332
He's on lockdown.
Russell's on it.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.367
You hang tough, okay?

26:43.369 --> 26:45.636
(indistinct conversations,
phones ringing)

27:03.121 --> 27:04.922
He's gone.

27:07.692 --> 27:10.127
Blake, he's-he's...

27:10.129 --> 27:11.829
He's dead. (sniffles)

27:11.831 --> 27:13.697
I'm so sorry.

27:13.699 --> 27:16.333
You know, it's crazy,

27:16.335 --> 27:19.970
But I can't stop playing it over
and over in my head.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.806
All the "if only's,"

27:22.808 --> 27:26.076
All the dominoes
that line up and fall over,

27:26.078 --> 27:29.079
And we have no idea where
they're gonna take us.

27:29.081 --> 27:32.182
You know, miller's kid's sick,
so she leaves early,

27:32.184 --> 27:34.251
So I shift dolan to patrol,

27:34.253 --> 27:37.821
Which means I put blake
at the reception desk.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.857
You couldn't have known
this was gonna happen.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.225
It's not your fault.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.660
That's my point.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.695
All the little pieces...

27:46.264 --> 27:49.700
...If it hadn't all gone
the way that it did, then...

27:52.103 --> 27:54.438
...Blake would-would
still be here.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.375
Alive.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.123
(jacob groaning)

28:16.194 --> 28:17.428
(groans)

28:17.430 --> 28:19.096
(groans)
this sucks!

28:19.098 --> 28:21.432
I think the pills
are starting to wear off.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.834
I'm sorry. I wish
I could help, but I think

28:23.836 --> 28:27.471
You've topped out
on the dosage there.

28:27.473 --> 28:31.842
You're not looking
for yourself on the
news, are you?

28:31.844 --> 28:37.781
You're waiting for a text
or a news report or something.

28:37.783 --> 28:40.250
Is there someone else
is out there, mark?
Someone who's

28:40.252 --> 28:41.952
Gonna do
the same thing you just did?

28:41.954 --> 28:44.955
Just shut up, man.

28:45.857 --> 28:49.126
You don't know a damn thing.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.794
You've changed.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.062
Just shut up.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.864
You said you wanted
to die today,

28:53.866 --> 28:55.966
But something's
different.

28:55.968 --> 28:59.336
I know a little something
about the will to survive,

28:59.338 --> 29:01.905
And I think I'm seeing
that it in you right now.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.241
You want to survive,
don't you?

29:04.243 --> 29:05.976
(jacob coughing)

29:05.978 --> 29:08.378
You all right, jacob?
You having trouble breathing?

29:08.380 --> 29:10.114
My chest feels kinda heavy.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.149
(gasping)

29:12.151 --> 29:13.884
Okay, all right, we're
gonna take care of you.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.153
I think the bullet nicked
his lung.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.955
It's starting to fill up
with blood.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.491
So? Look...

29:20.493 --> 29:21.892
Do-do something.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.895
Listen to me. I can't.
He needs a doctor.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.430
He needs a hospital, mark.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.898
(jacob coughs)

29:27.900 --> 29:30.000
I can't do that, man!

29:30.002 --> 29:31.835
Jacob is not a cop, man!

29:31.837 --> 29:34.004
He's not one of those people
you declared war on!

29:34.006 --> 29:37.007
You-you know this
bullet in here?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.842
That's a police bullet.

29:38.844 --> 29:41.912
You let him die now,
it's not gonna be on them.

29:41.914 --> 29:45.883
It's gonna be on you.
Is that what you want?

29:48.520 --> 29:51.922
Call ahead.
Let 'em know our eta.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.290
Watch your back.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.926
Russell was able
to talk mark powell

29:55.928 --> 29:57.194
Into letting
the wounded kid go.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.829
Maybe he's finally getting
through to him.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.397
If not, where are we
on the partner?

30:00.399 --> 30:02.099
Greg's got the warrant.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.067
He's tracing the e-mails from
lookingglass419 as we speak.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.302
We should know something soon.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.072
Russell:
You're going be okay, jacob.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.575
Thanks.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.510
I hope you get out of here.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.848
Both of you.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.918
All right,
let's move out.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.452
Hold your fire.
He's coming out.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.192
(door closes)

30:28.194 --> 30:30.260
Hang in there.
We got you.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.862
Make way for him.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.130
(phone rings)

30:33.132 --> 30:35.165
Yo, what do you got
for me, finlay?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.601
Greg's been running a trace
on lookingglass.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.170
Nick, what he's found
does not make any sense.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.272
What do you mean? Tell me.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.274
All of the the e-mails came
from one server.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.476
Whoever is powell's partner,

30:46.478 --> 30:49.179
Whoever he has been
communicating with...

30:49.181 --> 30:52.382
Is someone inside
the police department.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.858
Officer dunn,
give me a minute.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.993
Take a break.

31:05.396 --> 31:06.597
(door closes)

31:06.599 --> 31:08.165
Are you sure about this?

31:08.167 --> 31:11.401
At least half the e-mails
the shooter received

31:11.403 --> 31:14.171
Have been sent
from a computer
inside pd.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.006
What the hell
is going on here?

31:16.008 --> 31:19.209
Look, all this time
we thought lookingglass419

31:19.211 --> 31:20.911
Was just some
other screwed-up kid

31:20.913 --> 31:22.946
Looking to shoot up
some other police station.

31:22.948 --> 31:25.182
Like this was some kind
of suicide pact.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.884
But I'm telling you, jim,

31:26.886 --> 31:30.554
Lookingglass is one
of us, it's a cop.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.456
And there was never
some other target.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.359
This has always been
the target, lvpd.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.927
Yeah, but-but why?

31:36.929 --> 31:38.528
Why would a cop do <i>this?</i>

31:38.530 --> 31:39.997
Stokes:
Whatever the motive,

31:39.999 --> 31:41.598
Man, this is crazy.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.935
Yeah.
Yeah, this is crazy.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.170
I want this guy.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.171
Stokes:
Whoever it is,

31:48.173 --> 31:50.540
They knew mark powell very well.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.942
They know he hates cops,

31:51.944 --> 31:53.377
And they know
he's a ticking time bomb.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.379
So you say that
all the messages

31:55.381 --> 31:56.580
Came from
our server?

31:56.582 --> 31:57.948
Which computer?
I don't know.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.017
<i>Greg's running it right now.</i>

32:19.671 --> 32:20.637
(exhales)

32:20.639 --> 32:22.005
Not happening, is it?

32:22.007 --> 32:24.074
Whatever it is
you're waiting for.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.979
Or... Whoever it is
you're waiting for.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.015
No, I-it will, okay?
We had...

32:32.017 --> 32:33.450
We had a plan.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.952
He won't let me down.
(sniffs)

32:34.954 --> 32:37.154
I think he already has.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.222
And I think
you know that.

32:40.224 --> 32:43.026
Mark...

32:43.028 --> 32:45.128
I know it seems like
there's no way out

32:45.130 --> 32:46.596
For you right now.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.332
But there is...
There isn't.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.701
Yeah, I blew away
a bunch of cops!

32:50.703 --> 32:52.135
They're just
gonna kill me!

32:52.137 --> 32:54.004
Not if you walk out...

32:54.006 --> 32:54.972
With me.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.673
And then what?
(sniffles)

32:59.677 --> 33:01.078
Do you think I'm crazy?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.080
No, I don't.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.048
That's too bad.

33:05.050 --> 33:08.085
It's looking like that's
all I got left, you know?

33:08.087 --> 33:09.419
Some kind of insanity plea.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.421
I just don't
want to spend

33:11.423 --> 33:13.256
The rest of my
life in a cage.

33:13.258 --> 33:15.425
It's not about what you want.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.996
You gave that up
when you walked in here.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.330
I'm-I'm not gonna lie to you.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.499
There are gonna be consequences,
obviously,

33:22.501 --> 33:26.470
But if you choose
to live, man, there's...

33:26.472 --> 33:28.772
You can make something
out of that life.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.385
What if I don't?

33:41.387 --> 33:43.653
Don't you do that.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.222
(sniffles)

33:48.760 --> 33:50.127
(grunts)

33:50.129 --> 33:52.029
(panting)

33:53.598 --> 33:55.065
Okay, I won't.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.267
Okay, then,

33:57.269 --> 33:59.202
You're going
to do it.

33:59.204 --> 34:02.773
Kill me...

34:02.775 --> 34:05.242
Or I will kill you.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.461
No one else is gonna
die here today.

34:30.535 --> 34:32.602
(gasping)

34:35.440 --> 34:37.507
(sobbing)

34:51.556 --> 34:53.423
Brody:
How's the trace going?

34:53.425 --> 34:54.825
Figure out which computer
at pd sent e-mails to powell?

34:54.827 --> 34:57.394
It's a bit more
complicated than I thought.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.863
I'm comparing each terminal's
user history

34:59.865 --> 35:02.132
With the server history.

35:02.134 --> 35:05.102
It's a process of elimination,
until I find a match...

35:05.104 --> 35:06.136
How many terminals are there?

35:06.138 --> 35:07.671
Seventy-two.
How many have you done?

35:07.673 --> 35:09.172
Eleven.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.407
I'll help.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.851
I just heard.
Is it true?

35:20.853 --> 35:22.285
Is the kid gonna
give himself up?

35:22.287 --> 35:24.321
Yeah, it seems that
russell talked him out.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.455
You think he's
on the level?

35:25.457 --> 35:27.190
Well, we'll know
in a second.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.538
Russell:
Jim, we're coming out!

35:43.574 --> 35:45.509
Wait for my call.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.461
Brass:
That's far enough.

36:05.596 --> 36:08.832
D.B., I need you to step aside.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.300
Sir.
No, no, you're fine.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.335
You're fine. Just do
everything they say.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.538
I'm right here.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.407
Brass:
All right, mark.

36:17.409 --> 36:20.310
I want you to do
exactly as I tell you,

36:20.312 --> 36:21.545
And only

36:21.547 --> 36:22.646
What I tell you.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.550
Put your hands above your head

36:26.552 --> 36:27.617
And interlock your fingers.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.791
Get down on your knees.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.427
Mark, do what they say.

36:44.835 --> 36:46.570
I got him.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.339
Brass:
Now lay flat on your stomach.

36:58.349 --> 37:00.617
Brody:
Let's get this
info to brass.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.520
You heard him!
Get down! Now!

37:13.464 --> 37:14.564
Gun!

37:14.566 --> 37:16.833
Russell:
Mark, no. Mark, no!

37:17.635 --> 37:20.470
(gunfire)

37:21.572 --> 37:22.639
(shell casings clattering)

37:50.534 --> 37:52.535
Oh...

37:55.673 --> 37:58.541
He was reaching for a gun.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.780
He was reaching for this.

38:11.789 --> 38:12.822
Officer dolan.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.357
Give me your weapon.

38:14.359 --> 38:15.592
It was a good
shoot, captain.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.497
Put him into custody.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.533
Captain, it was a good shoot.

38:24.502 --> 38:25.835
What's going on?

38:25.837 --> 38:27.570
This doesn't
make any sense.

38:38.949 --> 38:40.850
Woman (over p.A.):
Lab tech to radiology.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.919
Lab tech
to radiology.

38:48.392 --> 38:49.793
We got the shooter.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.561
I heard.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.430
We also, uh, tracked down
the computer in pd

38:53.432 --> 38:54.631
That powell was
communicating with.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.633
Who was it?

38:56.635 --> 38:58.768
Dolan.

39:00.538 --> 39:01.871
Oh, my god.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.940
The marital troubles
that you talked about,

39:03.942 --> 39:05.108
Dolan was the
other man?

39:05.110 --> 39:07.043
He said that
after you

39:07.045 --> 39:08.878
Went back to blake,
he couldn't handle it.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.647
He said he couldn't
stop calling,

39:10.649 --> 39:11.981
He wouldn't
leave you alone.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.018
So-so dolan was
behind all this?

39:16.721 --> 39:17.687
I don't believe it.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.389
Yeah, neither do I.

39:19.391 --> 39:22.092
The e-mails came from
dolan's computer,

39:22.094 --> 39:23.960
But we checked
the duty roster.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.363
He wasn't there
when they were sent.

39:26.365 --> 39:29.065
So... He had nothing
to do with this.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.067
S-so it was
someone else?

39:31.069 --> 39:33.436
Somebody who had a
connection to powell.

39:33.438 --> 39:35.004
Somebody that he
crossed paths with

39:35.006 --> 39:36.973
When he was trying to
straighten his life out.

39:36.975 --> 39:41.444
We found this
photo from, uh...

39:41.446 --> 39:44.714
Last year's police
youth sports camp.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.683
I don't believe this, sara.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.618
That kid killed
my husband.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.755
He killed blake.
Yeah.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.556
He did, debra.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.559
Because you set the
dominoes in motion.

39:56.561 --> 39:59.028
Like you said, "all
those little pieces..."

39:59.030 --> 40:00.797
We searched your house,
we found your laptop.

40:00.799 --> 40:03.166
You created
lookingglass419.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.601
We searched your locker and
we found the burner phone

40:04.603 --> 40:05.935
That you used
to text powell.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.605
You gave him the "go"
two minutes after

40:08.607 --> 40:11.007
You put your husband
on the reception desk.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.475
You took advantage of

40:12.477 --> 40:14.444
A mentally unstable
16-year-old boy,

40:14.446 --> 40:15.545
You used him to
kill your husband

40:15.547 --> 40:16.780
And you designed
it to look like

40:16.782 --> 40:18.748
Some random
explosion of violence.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.550
You betrayed
your badge.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.818
You didn't care who
else you wounded,

40:21.820 --> 40:23.586
You didn't care who
else you killed.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.021
Why did you do this?

40:25.023 --> 40:27.457
Because blake was never
going to let me go?

40:27.459 --> 40:28.758
He beat me?

40:28.760 --> 40:29.692
I-I did it for
the insurance?

40:29.694 --> 40:31.728
I don't know, sara,
come on.

40:31.730 --> 40:32.762
Do you... Do you
really think that

40:32.764 --> 40:33.763
There's anything

40:33.765 --> 40:35.098
That I could
ay to you

40:35.100 --> 40:36.866
To make you
understand?

40:36.868 --> 40:38.935
Y...

40:42.506 --> 40:44.507
Before I... I say
anything else,

40:44.509 --> 40:45.775
I really think
that I sh...

40:45.777 --> 40:49.879
I should speak
to my police reps.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.848
You do that.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.786
(handcuffs clicking)

41:21.679 --> 41:23.746
♪

41:35.926 --> 41:39.095
In the news, they're going
to make him into a monster.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.897
(crying):
But he wasn't.

41:46.837 --> 41:47.937
You were with him at the end.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.739
Yes, ma'am.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.841
What did you see?

41:53.177 --> 41:54.711
Well, I saw...

41:54.713 --> 41:56.880
(sniffles)

41:56.882 --> 42:00.283
I saw a young man
who was confused

42:00.285 --> 42:01.951
And in a lot of pain.

42:01.953 --> 42:04.687
I saw what you saw.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.789
And whatever
you hear

42:06.791 --> 42:08.858
In the days to come...

42:08.860 --> 42:10.693
Only god can judge.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.566
And god can forgive, too.
