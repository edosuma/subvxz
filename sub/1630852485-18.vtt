00:10.511 --> 00:11.902
Why?

00:11.920 --> 00:13.754
Because we don't do it
for the money.

00:13.830 --> 00:16.089
I do. We're just
not making any.

00:16.166 --> 00:17.591
What? It's true, Brandy.

00:17.743 --> 00:19.259
It's because you don't have
the right exposure.

00:19.411 --> 00:21.928
I'm not interested
in your PR, Max.

00:22.005 --> 00:23.096
MAX: I could just
buy you outright.

00:23.249 --> 00:25.024

have you on board.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.771
Alright, round two,
here we go.

00:30.923 --> 00:33.757
I don't know how you got me
another shot at this,

00:33.776 --> 00:36.426
but, thanks, Dad.

00:36.445 --> 00:39.279
Well, Wyatt, you didn't
mess it up the first time,
I did.

00:39.431 --> 00:42.282
And, uh, I ain't exactly
got you another shot yet.

00:42.434 --> 00:45.602
Hold on, you haven't
spoken to him yet?

00:45.604 --> 00:47.954

you're just gonna waltz
into Max Keller's office

00:48.031 --> 00:49.122
and have
a conversation with him?

00:49.275 --> 00:51.467
Yeah, that's
pretty much the idea.

00:52.035 --> 00:53.701

-GAS WORKER: Just the lobby?

01:12.907 --> 01:14.147

01:14.224 --> 01:16.492
-Basement. This way.
-Basement.

MAX:
We are actually bringing in
a pastry chef...

01:27.830 --> 01:29.980
Hey. You can't go in there.

01:29.982 --> 01:31.757
JUDD:
It's only gonna
take a second.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.758
Howdy.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.075
Howdy, yourself.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.910
Sorry to interrupt
your meeting here.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.245
I think you met
my son yesterday.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.840
-Wyatt Harris.
-What-what do I do with that?

01:39.992 --> 01:41.517
-(Max laughs)
-The kid in the suit.

01:42.828 --> 01:43.844
Agent Smith.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.846
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.164
And now I get to meet his dad.

01:47.182 --> 01:48.849
This is, this is,
this is too good.

01:49.017 --> 01:51.777
Yeah, well, I understand
that he kind of belly-flopped
the interview,

01:51.928 --> 01:53.946
but that was my fault
'cause I sent him in here

01:54.097 --> 01:56.189
dressed up
in that monkey suit.

01:56.266 --> 01:59.042
The truth about my son is,
he's brilliant.

01:59.044 --> 02:00.360
He's a really kind kid.

02:00.512 --> 02:03.622
And he's graduating next week
as valedictorian.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.366
And, you know, I think
he'd bring a lot of value
to your company.

02:06.518 --> 02:08.518
So this is me
just coming in to ask

02:08.520 --> 02:10.963
if you'd be willing
to give him another shot.

02:11.156 --> 02:13.190
You remind me of my father.

02:13.192 --> 02:16.376
-Oh.
-I hate my father.

02:16.453 --> 02:20.806
So why don't you please
take your giant crutches

02:20.957 --> 02:24.034
and just mosey on
out of here... in peace,

02:24.052 --> 02:26.720
or I will call security.

02:26.796 --> 02:28.221
Mechanical room's right here.

02:28.298 --> 02:30.223
Ninety-eight PPM and climbing.

02:30.376 --> 02:32.568
We shouldn't be down here.
We have to evacuate.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.656
What-what-what was that?

02:37.807 --> 02:38.882
Oh, my God.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.217
(alarm blaring)

02:40.219 --> 02:41.809
Y'all get down
and cover your heads.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.246
(rumbling)

02:51.154 --> 02:52.671

02:59.663 --> 03:02.639

03:05.928 --> 03:07.001
GWYNETH: Mm.

03:07.079 --> 03:09.079
You are a terrible alarm clock.

03:09.097 --> 03:10.022
Oh, come on.

03:10.173 --> 03:11.248
I thought that that was better

03:11.250 --> 03:12.933
than the traffic report.

03:13.085 --> 03:15.252
(laughs) I'll say.

03:15.254 --> 03:17.754
But now I don't wanna
get out of bed and I--

03:17.773 --> 03:19.105
No, don't. Don't.

03:19.258 --> 03:22.034
Bad, bad alarm clock.
Bad alarm clock.

03:22.261 --> 03:24.870
(Gwyneth chuckles)
Owen, I have a deposition.

03:25.021 --> 03:27.021
-Skip it.
-I can't skip it.

03:27.115 --> 03:28.707
They're making me partner.

03:28.858 --> 03:31.025
Hmm. Quit.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.786
And TK needs to get to school.

03:32.862 --> 03:35.605
Well, he's seven. He can walk.

03:35.624 --> 03:37.365
Wow, we are really

03:37.443 --> 03:40.110
full of good suggestions
this morning, aren't we?

03:40.128 --> 03:41.553
Full of something.

03:43.873 --> 03:47.392
This is a perfect moment.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.561
We should make it last.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.957
You can't preserve
a perfect moment.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.651
That's why
they call it a moment.

03:57.129 --> 03:59.238
And I have a deposition.

04:01.075 --> 04:05.702
Well, we have a lifetime
of perfect moments ahead of us.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.665
(sighs)

04:27.601 --> 04:29.509
DR. JACOBS (echoing):
It's not what I'm hoping to see,

04:29.586 --> 04:33.921
but your CT scan does show
a new mass in your right lung.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.499
It doesn't necessarily mean

04:35.501 --> 04:36.758
that it's a recurrence
of the cancer.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.851
It could be a few things.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.003
So we're not leaping
to any conclusions.

04:40.022 --> 04:43.365
We're just, we're gonna take
this one step at a time, okay?

04:45.435 --> 04:48.269
Owen, did you hear
anything I just said?

04:48.289 --> 04:54.108
(scoffs) Yeah, I heard
CT scan, mass, lung.

04:54.186 --> 04:55.443
And did you also hear me say

04:55.521 --> 04:57.296
that we are gonna take
this one step at a time?

04:57.372 --> 04:59.280
-I thought we got all of it.
-We did.

04:59.282 --> 05:01.024
So what is that,
it's new cancer?

05:01.026 --> 05:02.801
We don't even know
if this is cancer.

05:02.878 --> 05:04.210
We need to do a biopsy.

05:04.363 --> 05:06.305
So if you have time,
I'd like to do that now.

05:06.532 --> 05:08.882
You know, send a sample
right away to the lab.

05:09.034 --> 05:10.267
(exhales deeply)

05:11.720 --> 05:12.686
Okay.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.057
I walk into the loft,

05:17.133 --> 05:18.817
Carlos is sitting
at the counter

05:18.968 --> 05:20.210
cool as a breeze...

05:20.228 --> 05:21.728
Which is that man's
resting state.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.896
NANCY: And?

05:22.972 --> 05:26.325
And he was updating his will.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.719
Was he taking you out of it?

05:29.721 --> 05:30.887
What? No.

05:30.906 --> 05:31.905
You guys don't think
that's morbid

05:32.057 --> 05:33.165
that he was just sitting there

05:33.392 --> 05:35.108
with his last will and testament
like it was Sudoku?

05:35.260 --> 05:37.002
I mean, I didn't even know
he had a will.

05:37.153 --> 05:39.079
So then we got
into this stupid fight

05:39.155 --> 05:41.231
because now he's on me
because I don't have a will.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.008
Hold up.
You don't have a will?

05:43.660 --> 05:45.010
-You do?
-Yeah.

05:45.161 --> 05:47.404
Bro, we risk
our lives every day.

05:47.497 --> 05:49.014
Plus it's just
sound financial planning.

05:49.165 --> 05:50.740
Alright, now you
sound like Carlos.

05:50.759 --> 05:54.686
TK, if anyone on this planet
should have a will, it's you.

05:54.838 --> 05:56.596
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

05:56.748 --> 06:01.267
Near-death experience guy.
You're like the NDE MVP.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.436
Do you remember when you got
hypothermia saving that kid?

06:03.589 --> 06:05.589
Or when you got shot
by that other kid?

06:05.591 --> 06:07.682
Mm-hmm. Bro, maybe you should
stay away from kids.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.368
No, you guys don't get it.

06:09.519 --> 06:12.687
The only reason I survived
those close calls

06:12.748 --> 06:14.039
is because I don't have a will.

06:14.116 --> 06:15.857
Because that makes sense.

06:15.934 --> 06:17.024
I'm serious.

06:17.102 --> 06:19.119
Once I sign that dotted line,
that's it.

06:19.271 --> 06:21.271
The Grim Reaper
is gonna collect his due.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.882
-Good God, that is dark.
-It's kind of mental.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.442
It's idiotic.

06:25.444 --> 06:27.944
Death isn't a credit card debt,
it's a part of life.

06:27.963 --> 06:30.055
And a hazard of this job.

06:30.132 --> 06:31.281
You can't cheat it.

06:31.283 --> 06:34.784
So stop acting like a child,

06:34.803 --> 06:36.186
get your act together.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.196

06:55.082 --> 06:56.139

06:59.161 --> 07:01.478
Owen, is everything okay?

07:01.496 --> 07:03.004
Yeah.

07:03.999 --> 07:06.925
No, Uh... it's hard to say.

07:07.076 --> 07:08.468
What's going on?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.430
I went to my oncologist

07:11.506 --> 07:14.224
who I thought was
no longer my oncologist.

07:15.251 --> 07:17.919
I'd had a physical
and there's a...

07:17.996 --> 07:19.688
there's a mass in my lung.

07:20.832 --> 07:24.017
Oh, Owen. I'm so sorry.

07:24.093 --> 07:28.196
They did a biopsy and...
now I just have to wait.

07:30.342 --> 07:33.176
My plan was to come
right down here and tell TK,

07:33.195 --> 07:37.104
but, uh, being candid with him
about my health status

07:37.182 --> 07:40.033
has always been a weak spot.

07:40.185 --> 07:41.442
And did you?

07:41.462 --> 07:42.961
Nope.

07:43.112 --> 07:44.796
But I did tell him
he needed a will.

07:44.873 --> 07:46.690
He needed a will?

07:46.692 --> 07:49.468
And that he should grow up
and stop acting like a child.

Judd... Thank you, God.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.104
Are you okay?

10:23.181 --> 10:24.848
Still kickin'.

10:24.866 --> 10:26.440
As much as I can
kick these days.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.209
(rumbling)

10:30.021 --> 10:31.612
It's 9-1-1.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.947
9-1-1 called him?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.466
Yeah, I'm sticking
with that dude.

10:34.617 --> 10:36.192
I take you got wind
of what happened here.

10:36.211 --> 10:38.452
All we know is that there's been
a partial building collapse,

10:38.472 --> 10:39.954
<i> but there's no word</i>
<i> on what caused it.</i>

10:40.048 --> 10:41.047
Did you hear from Wyatt?

10:41.199 --> 10:43.032
'Cause I left him
parked out front.

10:43.051 --> 10:44.959
Wyatt's fine, baby.
He's just worried about you.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.460
(mouths)
Yeah.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.646
But he does know you're alive,

10:47.797 --> 10:48.980
<i> so let's keep it that way.</i>

10:49.132 --> 10:50.607
Do you know
what floor you're on?

10:52.043 --> 10:54.210
Well, we-we was on
the sixth floor,

10:54.229 --> 10:55.879
now I reckon
we're on the fifth.

10:57.065 --> 10:58.173
JUDD:

10:58.175 --> 10:59.491
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

10:59.642 --> 11:02.719

You're gonna be okay.

Come on, we need help!

11:23.241 --> 11:24.574
We got a firefighter here.
It's okay.

11:24.592 --> 11:26.943

It's okay, Hugo, we're here.

-Quick, quick, quick.

Alright, let's find the IC.

TK, Nancy, go get as many

12:52.664 --> 12:54.564
Hey. Isn't that Judd's kid?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.444
Report is some kind of explosion
at the sublevel.

12:59.521 --> 13:02.005
Folks on the lower floors
heard a boom,

13:02.007 --> 13:03.506
followed by hammering
all around.

13:03.599 --> 13:05.691
It's the cracking of rebar
in its concrete.

13:05.768 --> 13:06.843
Right.

13:06.861 --> 13:08.344
A reinforced shear wall
came down,

13:08.363 --> 13:10.288
took three support
columns with it.

13:10.365 --> 13:12.198
It's a wonder this much of it
is still standing.

13:12.275 --> 13:14.441
Well, we gotta get these
people outta here now.

13:14.519 --> 13:16.035
The good news is they were
renovating the building,

13:16.112 --> 13:17.520
so it's mostly unoccupied.

13:17.539 --> 13:19.188
There's still some folks
stuck on an upper floor.

13:19.282 --> 13:21.966
Captain Strand,
one of 'em's yours.

I'm connecting you

13:30.977 --> 13:32.644
Hey, Judd,
how you doing in there?

13:32.795 --> 13:35.221
JUDD (over radio):
<i> I'm more, more or less</i>
<i> in one piece now, Cap.</i>

13:35.298 --> 13:36.797
But me and the folks
I'm up here with

13:36.817 --> 13:38.224
could use an assist getting out.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.043
OWEN:<i> Yeah, that's what</i>
<i> we're working on right now.</i>

13:40.061 --> 13:42.153
Listen, I need you
to avoid the stairwells

13:42.230 --> 13:44.138
that are closest to you,
they're compromised.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.140
<i> We've got reports</i>

13:46.159 --> 13:47.492
<i> You'd asphyxiate</i>

13:47.569 --> 13:48.827
<i> made it to the ground floor.</i>

13:49.054 --> 13:51.554
I'm pretty sure the elevators
ain't working either.

13:51.556 --> 13:54.057
Alright, I've got
the building plans
in front of me.

13:54.075 --> 13:56.059
Captain Strand,
can you describe the damage?

13:56.077 --> 13:57.669
OWEN: The lobby's gone.

13:58.730 --> 13:59.820
North side is a no.

13:59.898 --> 14:00.913
You're gonna have to lead people

14:00.990 --> 14:02.507
to the southeast corner
of the building.

14:02.584 --> 14:04.567
<i> Those stairwells</i>
<i> are gonna be your best bet.</i>

14:04.569 --> 14:07.828
Alright, I do see a stairwell
on the southeast corner,

14:07.906 --> 14:10.256
<i> but it's gonna be about</i>
<i> a 300-foot trek to get there.</i>

14:10.408 --> 14:12.742
<i> That's assuming</i>
<i> that the way is clear.</i>

14:12.744 --> 14:14.001
Then it's just--

14:14.079 --> 14:16.503
-Six flights down.
-GRACE:<i> Five, sweetheart.</i>

14:16.581 --> 14:19.023
You guys took the first flight
down the hard way, remember?

14:19.175 --> 14:20.341
My leg's broke again, Grace,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.676
and it's screaming at me
pretty good right now.

14:22.754 --> 14:23.528
GRACE:<i> Baby, listen.</i>

14:23.922 --> 14:24.937
Every part of you
is gonna be screaming

14:25.090 --> 14:26.255
<i> if you don't get out of there.</i>

14:26.349 --> 14:28.107
OWEN:<i> Judd, could you</i>
<i> handle two stories?</i>

14:28.259 --> 14:29.868
There's some kind of
a roof garden

14:30.019 --> 14:31.202
on the southeast side.

14:31.279 --> 14:33.262
Yep, two flights
is better than five.

14:33.281 --> 14:35.098
That sounds like a plan.
I'm...

14:35.100 --> 14:36.857
I'm gonna have to put you
in my pocket, Gracie.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.192
I'm gonna need both my hands.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.785
Hang up and get moving.

<i> You get home, okay?</i>

14:45.534 --> 14:48.386
Hey, you know
where that roof deck is
that he's talking about?

14:48.463 --> 14:50.279
Uh, yeah, yeah. I was gonna
put a members-only club there.

14:50.298 --> 14:52.448
Get these three there
as fast as you can, sir.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.466
-What about you?
-JUDD: Don't wait for me.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.967

-Just lean on me.
-JUDD: Mr. Keller--

14:59.624 --> 15:01.474
No, no. We would all be dead
of smoke inhalation already

15:01.568 --> 15:02.308
if it wasn't for you, okay?

15:02.644 --> 15:04.903
Lyle, Lyle,
get on the other side.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.295
I'm stronger than you.

15:06.314 --> 15:07.980
-Alright. We got this.
-Let's go, let's go.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.149
Move, move, move,
move, move, move.

15:10.301 --> 15:13.060
My wife and my daughter
will be grateful to y'all.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.154
And, Mr. Keller,
maybe we could have a word

15:15.231 --> 15:16.897
about my son getting this job.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.141
If we make it out.

15:18.143 --> 15:19.250
MAX:
He's already got the job, okay?

15:19.360 --> 15:21.144
And if we actually
get out of here,

15:21.146 --> 15:22.754
he's already
been promoted. Twice.

15:22.905 --> 15:24.071
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, let's go.

15:24.165 --> 15:25.548
Let's go, let's go.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.114
It's my fault he's in there.

15:33.116 --> 15:35.249
If I hadn't tanked
on my first interview...

15:35.326 --> 15:37.827
If you hadn't tanked
on your first interview,

15:37.845 --> 15:38.844
you'd have that job.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.939
Which means he would
have been in there anyway

15:41.015 --> 15:42.165
looking for you.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.183
Trust me when I tell you.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.444
He prefers it this way.

15:48.764 --> 15:50.764
Alright, 126.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.175
Stage a ladder down here.

15:52.193 --> 15:54.026
Extend the aerial
up to the roof deck.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.119
-MARJAN: On it, Cap.
-PAUL: Okay, we got it.

15:55.196 --> 15:56.696
Did you talk to him?
Is he okay?

15:56.772 --> 15:57.956
He's tough.

15:58.032 --> 16:00.683
We're gonna
get him out of there, alright?

16:00.702 --> 16:03.519
Hey, Captain, you said there
was a sublevel gas explosion?

16:03.521 --> 16:06.464
Most likely. We shut
the mains off the street level.

16:06.541 --> 16:08.115
The gas company
didn't do it, did they?

16:08.193 --> 16:09.283
CAPTAIN ANDREWS (over radio):
<i> No.</i>

16:09.377 --> 16:11.302

driving the truck go in there

right before the explosion
with a security guard.

16:13.715 --> 16:15.890
-You see them come out?
-No.

16:17.218 --> 16:18.884

-Yep?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.055
We're going in.

16:23.224 --> 16:24.315
CAPTAIN ANDREWS:
If they were at
the point of ignition,

16:24.467 --> 16:26.042
their chances
of being survivors--

16:26.044 --> 16:27.210
Is greater than you think.

16:27.228 --> 16:28.711
Excuse me. Coming through.

16:28.730 --> 16:29.696
So clear out.

MATEO: Cap, we sure
they shut off the gas?

16:48.249 --> 16:49.323
PPMs are off the charts.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.509
There was enough gas
in the explosion

16:51.586 --> 16:52.493
to bring the house down,

16:52.679 --> 16:55.263
so there's probably
some pockets left.

of the fireman's carry?

18:48.186 --> 18:50.277
Go on. Clear it out.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.629
Keep me on the radio.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.867
MAX:
Okay. Here-here we go.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.886
(groaning sharply)

19:07.038 --> 19:09.147
Just a few more.
Just a few more.

19:09.223 --> 19:11.965
-Come on, you're almost there.
-MAX: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.893
BRANDY: Let's go.

19:13.969 --> 19:15.302
Alright.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.696
-MATEO: Careful. Careful.
-(groaning)

19:17.824 --> 19:19.323
MATEO: I know.

19:20.976 --> 19:23.578
-BRANDY: Okay. Alright.
-(Judd groans)

19:26.057 --> 19:28.166
We can do this.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.299
MARJAN: I see them.

19:39.237 --> 19:40.595
(Judd groaning)

19:43.408 --> 19:46.091
Hey, 126, we got eyes
on firefighter Ryder,

19:46.093 --> 19:48.093
<i> plus four civilians.</i>

19:48.246 --> 19:50.396
Everyone looks to be
in one piece.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.842
Listen, you just couldn't stay
out of the action, could ya?

19:55.920 --> 19:59.488
I'll tell you what,
after this, I might never
leave the house again.

20:00.849 --> 20:02.033
-Whoa, whoa.
-There he is.

20:02.109 --> 20:04.351
There he is!
Let's get that basket.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.537
Paul, don't drop
my husband, okay?

20:06.614 --> 20:08.781
PAUL (over phone):
<i> We'll handle him</i>
<i> with utmost care.</i>

20:08.933 --> 20:10.291
Okay.

20:14.697 --> 20:16.297
(groans)

20:18.200 --> 20:19.634
There you go...

20:22.613 --> 20:23.596
Hello!

20:32.881 --> 20:34.148
Hello!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.527
(sniffs)

20:49.898 --> 20:52.250
(people screaming)

20:55.070 --> 20:56.420
You good?

20:57.832 --> 20:59.507
MATEO: You guys alright?

21:00.743 --> 21:02.385
(Marjan groans)

21:05.840 --> 21:07.515
(yelling) Captain Strand!

21:08.843 --> 21:10.601
Captain Strand, do you copy?

21:13.756 --> 21:15.231
Captain Strand!

21:18.336 --> 21:20.569
Captain Strand, do you copy?

21:30.123 --> 21:32.665
(building creaking)

21:39.632 --> 21:40.673
(groans weakly)

21:44.637 --> 21:46.512
(radio static)

21:46.547 --> 21:48.723
Strand 126 to IC.

21:50.368 --> 21:52.685
-Anyone copy?
-(radio static)

21:57.299 --> 22:01.694
I'm in the basement.
I don't see any point of egress.

22:04.065 --> 22:05.531
Does anyone copy?

22:06.141 --> 22:07.616
(man coughing)

22:09.495 --> 22:10.453
Hello!

22:11.389 --> 22:13.722
MAN (weakly):
Yeah. Over here.

22:13.741 --> 22:15.249
(coughing)

22:19.655 --> 22:20.713
(groans)

22:37.598 --> 22:38.981
(man coughs)

22:42.862 --> 22:45.154
OWEN: Alright.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.198
Try not to move.

22:47.274 --> 22:48.257
Yeah.

22:48.350 --> 22:49.775
I pretty much
got that one covered

22:49.927 --> 22:51.494
without even trying.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.231
You FD?

22:56.233 --> 23:00.102
Yeah. My name's Owen.
What's your name?

23:00.121 --> 23:02.271
-Manny.
-Hey, Manny.

23:02.289 --> 23:04.273
I'm gonna try to
get you out of here.

23:04.291 --> 23:08.127
And after that,
who's gonna get you out?

23:08.279 --> 23:09.945
My team.
They're just outside.

23:09.964 --> 23:11.472
They should be here any minute.

23:12.950 --> 23:14.392
If they can find us.

23:16.378 --> 23:18.804
Yeah, I may have to give 'em
a hand with that.

23:18.806 --> 23:20.122
(Manny coughs)

23:20.141 --> 23:22.124
MANNY:
You see the second one?

23:22.217 --> 23:23.959
-OWEN: The second one?
-MANNY: Yeah.

23:23.961 --> 23:27.646
I heard over my radio
there was a second one.

23:27.798 --> 23:29.573
-You have a radio?
-Yeah.

23:30.968 --> 23:33.485
Can't seem to grab it right now.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.804
(Manny coughing)

23:35.823 --> 23:37.156
Alright.

23:37.308 --> 23:38.624
This might be loud.

23:40.828 --> 23:42.378
Think they can hear that?

23:44.815 --> 23:46.406
The seismic sensors will.

23:46.484 --> 23:48.717
It'll turn this whole pile
into one big microphone.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.472
MANNY: Awesome.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.683
(Manny coughing)

23:57.328 --> 23:59.344
Alright, I gotta figure out
a way to get you out of there.

23:59.421 --> 24:00.345
(coughing continues)

24:00.665 --> 24:03.232
Let me find something
to pry this off ya.

24:19.183 --> 24:20.416
(Owen grunts)

24:24.947 --> 24:26.872
Let me know if I can help.

24:27.024 --> 24:28.799
Hey, hey.

24:28.876 --> 24:31.360
You can help by staying awake.

24:31.378 --> 24:32.720
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

24:33.698 --> 24:35.030
Got a wife?

24:35.032 --> 24:36.715
Had a-- had a wife.

24:36.867 --> 24:38.050
OWEN: Yeah, me too.

24:38.126 --> 24:39.643
Got any kids?

24:40.554 --> 24:41.562
Two girls.

24:44.132 --> 24:45.649
Emma, she's 36

24:45.801 --> 24:47.568
and Mya...

24:49.230 --> 24:52.472
I guess she'll be 28 next month.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.807
Man, what is your secret?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.567
You don't look old enough
to have kids that old.

24:55.644 --> 25:01.332
Well, they were 16
and 8 when I died, so...

25:04.003 --> 25:06.003
That's the math, right?

25:10.067 --> 25:11.425
(metal thuds)

25:17.850 --> 25:21.727
Manny. Manny Canales. NYPD.

25:23.639 --> 25:27.099
You and I were in the Concourse
the day the South Tower fell.

25:27.251 --> 25:30.402
Which is how
we ended up like this. Yeah.

25:37.762 --> 25:42.248
♪

25:43.025 --> 25:44.375
Give it a rest, Owen.

25:44.526 --> 25:47.503
You never get
this thing off me, remember?

25:50.365 --> 25:52.591
What are you doin'
down here, man?

25:54.628 --> 25:55.594
I'm not here.

25:57.114 --> 25:58.597
Obviously, uh...

26:00.117 --> 26:03.619
I must be bleeding out
under a different building.

26:03.621 --> 26:04.979
Yeah, well, maybe.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.716
You've been stuck
down here longer than I was.

26:09.735 --> 26:13.720
See, me, I... I was only
like this for 29 minutes

26:13.798 --> 26:16.815
and that second tower came down.

26:16.967 --> 26:19.318
I was done, but you... you...

26:19.470 --> 26:23.247
you've been down here,
what, 20 years, right?

26:26.660 --> 26:28.234
That's the math.

26:28.312 --> 26:30.588
So why you keep
coming back, man?

26:33.834 --> 26:35.217
I don't.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.179
It must have been on my mind.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.977
They told me today
that my cancer might be back.

26:47.589 --> 26:48.755
MANNY: Cancer?

26:48.774 --> 26:50.399
A lot of people got sick.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.194
The guys who went back in.

26:55.356 --> 26:57.448
And people who were just there.

26:59.343 --> 27:02.620
They say 3,000 people died
that day, but it was more.

27:03.105 --> 27:04.455
It was...

27:05.625 --> 27:06.749
thousands more.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.703
MANNY: Man, it sucks
to be a statistic, man.

27:11.856 --> 27:13.255
(exhales)

27:15.376 --> 27:16.950
OWEN:
How can I get away from a day

27:17.027 --> 27:19.378
that keeps coming for me?

27:19.530 --> 27:21.430
MANNY:
This day ain't comin' for you.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.976
You... You keep
going back to it.

27:26.128 --> 27:27.561
That's not true.

27:29.206 --> 27:31.649
MANNY:
Then why you keep
that thing on your desk?

27:34.211 --> 27:35.694
It's a reminder.

27:37.064 --> 27:39.156
To never forget.

27:39.233 --> 27:42.384
MANNY:
Nobody asking you
to forget, brother.

27:42.386 --> 27:45.621
Hell, far too many people
already have.

27:48.334 --> 27:53.578
But you don't need to be,
you know, keeping a piece of...

27:53.731 --> 27:56.156
what they did to us

27:56.175 --> 27:58.509
and turning it
into some holy relic.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.012
I hope that's not
what I'm doing.

28:02.089 --> 28:05.257
MANNY:
Look, man, this day
may get you yet.

28:05.409 --> 28:08.243
But you need to stop
acting like it already has.

28:08.262 --> 28:10.354
You need to stop living in it.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.431
You know,
you need to stop trying

28:12.583 --> 28:14.525
to make things
turn out different.

28:16.011 --> 28:17.277
I'm not.

28:18.013 --> 28:19.012
MANNY: Here it comes.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.532
(rumbling and thudding)

get you outta here.

Welcome back, Cap.

28:44.615 --> 28:47.141
We weren't sure
we were gonna get a chance
to see you again, man.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.685
Scared the hell out of us, Dad.

28:50.879 --> 28:52.396
We're all pretty worried.

28:54.049 --> 28:56.792
Everybody's been
praying for you, Captain Strand.

28:56.810 --> 28:58.068
That's right.

28:58.145 --> 29:00.128
MATEO: I knew
you'd pull through.

29:00.130 --> 29:01.488
He did say that.

29:02.724 --> 29:04.199
What happened to Manny?

29:05.152 --> 29:07.161
Did he make it?

29:08.939 --> 29:10.497
Who's Manny?

29:13.035 --> 29:14.418
GWYNETH: He died.

29:21.576 --> 29:22.593
Gwyn?

29:22.744 --> 29:24.595
You can't save everyone.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.182
I know.

29:31.678 --> 29:32.978
I'm not sure you do.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.982
I wish I could
have saved you.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.652
I'm sorry.

29:41.688 --> 29:42.988
It wasn't your fault.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.993
We never should have gotten
out of the bed that morning.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.622
The world wouldn't
let us stay in bed.

Hey, Dad.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.411
How are you feeling?

Like a building fell on me.

31:58.066 --> 32:00.233
(TK chuckles softly)

32:00.310 --> 32:02.169
I told 'em
you were indestructible.

The doctors when they

when you went in for surgery,
remember?

32:53.213 --> 32:54.721
What's going on, Dad?

32:56.867 --> 32:58.517
We did a biopsy.

33:00.053 --> 33:03.038
The doctor says it could be...

33:03.056 --> 33:06.208
a number of things that...

33:06.210 --> 33:09.361
Doesn't necessarily mean
that the cancer is back.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.157
It might be.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.976
Well, I can't do it again, Dad.

33:16.996 --> 33:20.071
Pretty sure I'd be the one
doing it again, son.

33:20.224 --> 33:24.710
No, I mean,
I can't lose another parent.

33:25.579 --> 33:26.911
Not now.

Well, that is not something
either one of us

It's why you make a will.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.258
It's not to prepare for the end

because that comes
no matter what we do.

TK: Mm-hmm.

34:48.812 --> 34:52.238
At... 3:18 in the morning?

34:52.316 --> 34:54.332
Yeah. I don't wanna
waste another minute.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.760
You think you can
survive until dawn?

34:56.987 --> 34:58.578
I mean, you put it
off this long. I--

34:58.597 --> 35:03.558
It'll be easy because I'd just
leave everything to my husband.

35:05.846 --> 35:07.229
What?

35:08.832 --> 35:09.981
Marry me.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.932
TK...

35:20.010 --> 35:21.509
Baby, I'm-I'm serious.
Let's get married.

35:21.528 --> 35:24.287
Yeah, TK, we've had
a pretty dramatic week.

35:24.397 --> 35:26.364
Baby, this isn't,
this isn't drama.

35:26.441 --> 35:28.016
-TK, we're both--
-This isn't...

35:28.109 --> 35:30.293
It's not drama. It's not drama.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.420
It's love.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.715
The kind that
you can't get away from.

35:38.195 --> 35:43.515
And maybe my life
has been scarred with loss.

35:45.886 --> 35:48.270
And at times
it's felt inescapable.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.524
But that's the risk
of love, right?

35:55.212 --> 35:57.529
For the first time in my life...

35:58.732 --> 36:00.882
the love that I feel

36:00.884 --> 36:04.161
is infinitely more powerful

36:04.237 --> 36:07.389
than the fear of losing it.

36:07.391 --> 36:11.317
And every moment that we're not
married is a wasted moment.

36:11.395 --> 36:14.421
And, baby, we...
we only get so many.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.900
-And every day--
-Tyler.

36:18.902 --> 36:20.385
Can I say yes now?

36:21.162 --> 36:22.554
Can I say yes now?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.391
I sure hope so.

36:26.927 --> 36:28.351
Then, yes...

36:29.688 --> 36:31.021
a thousand times yes.

36:39.847 --> 36:40.939
You're not just saying yes

36:41.091 --> 36:42.941
so you could go
back to sleep, right?

36:43.093 --> 36:45.619
I mean, maybe. Maybe.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.454
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

36:56.531 --> 37:00.217
Well, well, look who's
flaunting their uprightness.

37:00.368 --> 37:02.126
-About to get sprung?
-Yeah.

37:02.203 --> 37:03.703
Not a moment too soon.

37:03.780 --> 37:04.888
You know, I think
they were thinking of

37:05.057 --> 37:07.615
renaming this entire wing
after the Strand family.

37:07.634 --> 37:09.709
I bet you that comes
with a hell of a parking spot.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.876
Where are the girls?

37:10.896 --> 37:11.895
JUDD:
Oh, I sent 'em home.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.972
Poor Grace
now has two relations

37:14.048 --> 37:14.956
that aren't walking
very well, so...

37:15.049 --> 37:16.399
When is the new
recovery timeline?

37:16.643 --> 37:19.310
She told me about
three weeks more than
the old timeframe.

37:19.463 --> 37:22.146
-That's a lucky break.
-It's two.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.574
I got, I got six lucky screws
in there too.

37:24.726 --> 37:25.800
Phew.

37:25.935 --> 37:27.652
How about you,
the department letting you

37:27.804 --> 37:28.820
get right back at it?

37:28.896 --> 37:30.229
In a couple of days.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.564
Captain Scofield's there now.

37:31.641 --> 37:35.643
But I hear Marjan
is really running the show.

37:35.645 --> 37:38.755
Well, I bet you old Scofield'll
be happy when you get back.

37:40.834 --> 37:42.175
Listen...

37:43.911 --> 37:46.154
when the day finally does come

37:46.156 --> 37:47.931
and they really do
have to fill that chair,

37:48.082 --> 37:49.248
I just want you to know
the department

37:49.326 --> 37:52.084
has my recommendation
in file.

37:52.162 --> 37:54.396
Assuming you ever
get back on your feet...

37:55.181 --> 37:57.232
the 126 is your command.

37:58.168 --> 37:59.684
It's your house, Judd.

37:59.761 --> 38:00.694
Always has been.

38:01.929 --> 38:03.697
I appreciate that, Owen.

38:10.347 --> 38:12.706
(pop music playing
over speakers)

38:13.775 --> 38:15.517
So do we make a speech?

38:15.519 --> 38:16.184
We could.

38:16.202 --> 38:18.202
Something heartfelt,

38:18.204 --> 38:19.796
thanking them
for being there for us?

38:19.947 --> 38:21.947
Sounds good.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.301
Or we could put
a ring on your finger

38:24.303 --> 38:27.045
and you could ask them,
"Does this make me
look engaged?"

38:27.197 --> 38:28.713
Let's stick
with heartfelt, okay?

38:28.790 --> 38:30.698
-Yeah.
-(knock on door)

38:30.717 --> 38:31.866
-Hey!
-Hey.

38:31.868 --> 38:33.643
TK: Hey, guys.

38:33.795 --> 38:34.886
Hey, man.

38:34.962 --> 38:36.054
You look great, man.

38:36.206 --> 38:38.464
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:38.542 --> 38:40.633
Wow!

38:40.710 --> 38:42.877
-This is amazing. What a spread.
-Uh, thank you for coming.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.379
Okay, this looks amazing.

38:44.397 --> 38:45.488
TK: Where's Nance and Mateo?

38:45.565 --> 38:47.732
Oh, they were making out
in the parking lot,

38:47.884 --> 38:49.141
so they missed the elevator.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.810
Not that we saw them.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.145
Hey, hey, party can start now.

38:53.223 --> 38:55.981
Wow, look at that spread!

38:56.059 --> 38:59.151
-Didn't wanna
hold the elevator, huh?
-Nope.

38:59.229 --> 39:01.338
Guys, we are so happy
that you're with us today.

39:01.489 --> 39:03.155
Yeah, to get that beat down
coming your way.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.990
Paladins never say die.

39:05.068 --> 39:06.593
Actually, before we start...

39:07.495 --> 39:08.511
Oh...

39:13.685 --> 39:17.412
We just wanted to say
that you guys have been just--

39:17.414 --> 39:19.022
Hold up.
Is this Taleggio cheese?

39:19.173 --> 39:20.582
And Wagyu salami?

39:20.600 --> 39:21.691
It is, in fact.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.084
Um, but I just wanted to say
that you guys have been--

39:23.103 --> 39:24.343
No, no.
Something's going on here.

39:24.437 --> 39:26.604
(softly)
Heartfelt speech?
Heartfelt speech?

39:26.681 --> 39:27.847
Guys, that champagne?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.014
No, it's sparkling cider.

39:29.092 --> 39:30.758
Mm-hmm.
Because TK doesn't drink.

39:30.777 --> 39:32.452
But there's gonna be a toast.

39:34.021 --> 39:36.021
-No way.
-Yes way.

39:36.099 --> 39:37.599
-Yes way?
-Yes way?

39:37.601 --> 39:38.691
Oh, my God.

39:38.768 --> 39:39.959
Yes way.

39:41.271 --> 39:42.270
MARJAN: Oh, my God.

39:42.288 --> 39:44.122
Okay, I'm a little lost here.

39:44.124 --> 39:45.773
ALL: They're engaged!

39:45.792 --> 39:47.609
-No way!
-(cheering)

39:47.702 --> 39:49.168
Oh-ho!

39:49.279 --> 39:50.445
Yo, I'm so happy for you!

39:50.463 --> 39:52.280
-Dibs on best man.
-No, no, no, no.

39:52.298 --> 39:54.465
-That is not how this works.
-It is when you say it first.

39:54.618 --> 39:56.117
First? You were literally
the last one to know.

39:56.119 --> 39:59.211
Guys, guys, it's okay
because we get two best men.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.731
-PAUL: Hey!
-But do they have to be men?

40:02.792 --> 40:03.808
Well, yeah, no.

40:03.885 --> 40:06.152
-(overlapping chatter)
-(laughter)

40:11.743 --> 40:13.410
Hey!

40:13.561 --> 40:15.227
Aw. Mm.

40:15.305 --> 40:17.747
Thank you for making this work
on such short notice.

40:17.974 --> 40:19.064
TOMMY: Of course.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.826
Your message said
you had news.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.586
I do indeed.

40:23.738 --> 40:26.089
Oh, I hope you don't mind,
I took the liberty of ordering.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.591
Oh, okay. Well, what is it?

40:28.743 --> 40:29.909
Just taste it first.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.836
Um, it's better
than explaining it.

40:31.913 --> 40:34.155
TOMMY: Mm! Mm-hmm.

40:34.157 --> 40:35.173
-OWEN: Right?
-Is that almond milk?

40:35.249 --> 40:36.916
It's called a Gibraltar.

40:36.993 --> 40:40.678
And it turns out
it is the perfect beverage

40:40.755 --> 40:42.230
with which to celebrate...

40:43.758 --> 40:46.000
my fungal infection.

40:46.002 --> 40:47.669
Your fungal infection?

40:47.671 --> 40:49.112
My fungal infection.

40:49.263 --> 40:50.930
You have a fungal infection?

40:50.949 --> 40:53.174
I do. Inside me.

40:53.176 --> 40:57.178
Owen...
Oh, that's fantastic news.

40:57.197 --> 40:59.030
Oh, congratulations.

40:59.106 --> 41:00.123
Well, on not having cancer,

41:00.200 --> 41:01.774
which I'm assuming
that's what this means.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.108
Indeed it does.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.019
Aspergillosis.
You ever heard of it?

41:05.021 --> 41:06.187
I most certainly have.

41:06.206 --> 41:08.189
It's an occupational hazard
for us.

41:08.208 --> 41:10.041
It shows up as a nodule,

41:10.193 --> 41:11.951
which can look
a lot like cancer.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.286
-Turns out it is not.
-Yes!

41:14.380 --> 41:17.957
My oncologist, who is now once
again no longer my oncologist,

41:17.976 --> 41:21.035
tells me I'm 100%
still in remission.

41:21.128 --> 41:22.312
Yes.

41:22.630 --> 41:26.149
I just wanted to say that
to another living human being.

41:26.300 --> 41:29.134
Well, I'm honored
you found me qualified.

41:29.212 --> 41:30.895
Well, honestly,
my fungal infection

41:30.972 --> 41:32.638
was just an elaborate ruse

41:32.657 --> 41:36.400
because it has taken too long
for the two captains of the 126

41:36.477 --> 41:38.978
to sit down
outside the firehouse.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.479
And I wanted to fix it.

41:40.557 --> 41:44.149
(chuckles) Well, you have
been buried at work.

41:44.227 --> 41:46.986
Ahh! I see what you did there.
