12:37.357 --> 12:39.259
That's because it is a castle.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.328
It's been in the family
for three centuries.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.830
What kind of family is this?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.231
A royal one.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.300
You'll be looking
after Princess Theodora,

12:47.334 --> 12:50.470
the daughter of King
Maximillian III of Winshire.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.140
And you're just
telling me this now?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.675
Discretion is of
the utmost importance.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.210
The palace wouldn't
want it getting out

12:57.244 --> 12:59.980
that they're employing
yet another governess.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.681
How many have there been?

13:01.714 --> 13:04.818
Let's say the Princess can be
a bit of a handful.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.953
(CHUCKLES)
That many, huh?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.990
What a warm greeting.

it's not for you.

our head housekeeper.

13:28.708 --> 13:29.843
She'll show you
to your quarters.

Welcome, Miss Evans.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.848
"Allie," please.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.318
We use formalities here,
Miss Evans.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.988
Sorry. Hi.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.894
Carter, take the new
governess's bags to her room.

Yes, ma'am.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.332

13:52.365 --> 13:55.835
I'm sure you'll want to change
into something more appropriate.

Are you familiar
with court protocol?

14:16.823 --> 14:19.392
I watch Downton Abbey.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.661
Fergus will give you a schedule,

14:21.694 --> 14:24.631
and I'll have
your uniform sent up.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.967
You won't see much
of His Royal Highness,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.837
and I can almost
guarantee he won't see you.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.705
These are your quarters.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.543
This is all mine?

14:36.576 --> 14:38.711
I wouldn't get too attached.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.114
Chances are you won't
make it to Christmas.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.404
I asked you to give
her a check, not a job.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.972
She wouldn't take it.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.707
Why not?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.010
I believe she
considered it a handout.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.113
I realize that she's not
the conventional choice,

16:20.147 --> 16:23.850
but then again, we haven't
had much luck with convention.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.154
You've always
trusted my decisions, Max.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.389
Why don't I feel that
same trust right now?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.459
I can't imagine.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.828
Certainly, Chancellor.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.999
I trust you had
an enjoyable holiday.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.501
It was hardly a holiday.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.903
Your hotel bill says otherwise.

I don't need to remind you
that your popularity is down,

a job for a thousand years.

might I suggest that
we focus on Christmas Eve.

So, what do you want to do?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.091
You're letting me decide?

26:33.425 --> 26:34.794
Hmm, it's your castle.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.405
Do you like this one?

26:47.306 --> 26:49.308
Yeah.
It looks kind of like you.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.978
You're not afraid of bugs?

26:52.011 --> 26:53.646
(CHUCKLES)
Are you kidding?

26:53.680 --> 26:56.883
New York has the toughest
cockroaches in the world.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.086
My last governess
was scared of bugs.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.288
She also said I was annoying.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.092
All kids are annoying.
That's their job.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.161
How old are you?
How old do you think I am?

27:10.596 --> 27:11.798
Sixty.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.702
Close. Thirty-one.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.937
Are you married?
Nope.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.105
No one ever asked?

27:19.138 --> 27:21.741
Oh, someone asked once,
in sixth grade.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.243
Are you an old maid?

27:24.276 --> 27:26.278
Well, I'm a maid.
I mean, I was a maid.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.614
I mean, I was... I was fired.

27:29.716 --> 27:30.983
Not anymore.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.820
Are you here just 'cause
you want to marry my father?

27:33.853 --> 27:37.690
A lot of women do.
That's why they're nice to me.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.391
Well, you can rest assured,

27:39.425 --> 27:43.295
if I'm nice,
it's because I like you.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.332
And I'm more likely to marry
Santa Claus than your father.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.467
Santa Claus is already married.

27:49.635 --> 27:50.970
As he should be.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.141
This is a great greenhouse.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.848
It was my mother's.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.919
People say I
look a lot like her.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.790
You must miss her a lot.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.793
I guess.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.030
You know, I lost my mom too.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.601
And my dad.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.005
Back home,
when things get tough,

28:26.038 --> 28:28.074
my brother and sister
and I put our hands

28:28.107 --> 28:30.242
together and we say,

28:31.477 --> 28:33.645
"We're the Evans."

28:33.679 --> 28:36.816
It makes us feel like
we can get through anything.

28:37.683 --> 28:40.386
So are the Evans special?

28:40.419 --> 28:42.088
We're just a regular family.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.528
Do you think

28:49.561 --> 28:52.064
we should put a few
in Miss Wick's bed?

Oh, there you are.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.175
Theodora is late
for the Christmas photograph.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.443
What?

29:04.476 --> 29:05.677
I left a schedule
under your door.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.014
I didn't get any schedule.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.648

29:15.321 --> 29:16.688
Let's go!

29:18.524 --> 29:20.259
Hurry!

29:20.292 --> 29:23.129
Come on,
come on, come on, come on!

29:23.162 --> 29:25.197
Okay, let's go!
Off with the jacket.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.203
Ah! Miss Theodora,
at last.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.404
Fergus will show
you to your place.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.572
Apologies.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.107
Miss Evans.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.276
There.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.147
Can I sit in
the chair with you, Father?

29:41.180 --> 29:42.681
Not this time.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.821
I suppose we can airbrush her
jeans from the final photograph.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.130
PHOTOGRAPHER:
A little closer in.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.266
Ready and...

30:08.007 --> 30:11.911
So, how many will be in
attendance at the Christmas gala?

30:12.979 --> 30:14.914
A few more than last year.

30:14.947 --> 30:18.050
The Count of Ashbury, I assume?

30:18.084 --> 30:19.685
MAXIMILLIAN:
With his new wife.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.221
RIGGS: You mean his
second new wife.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.857
Or is it his third?
Hard to keep track.

ice skating tomorrow,

30:33.432 --> 30:36.235
just the two of us,
aren't you, Father?

30:37.169 --> 30:39.972
I'm afraid that'll
have to wait, Theodora.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.673
The day after tomorrow?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.311
Perhaps after the holidays.

that back on her plate?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.568
It was under three seconds.

31:09.601 --> 31:10.970
Excuse me?

31:12.471 --> 31:13.705
Uh, the three-second rule.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.607
If it drops on the floor,
but you pick it up

31:15.641 --> 31:17.409
within three seconds,
it's still good.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.682
I take it you
don't have that rule.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.520
When I was at university,
we had the three-minute rule.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.689
My roommate barely made that.

(ALL LAUGH)

31:34.293 --> 31:36.195
In fact, a toast.

Christmas in your heart,

31:38.097 --> 31:41.934
then there is most definitely
Christmas in the air.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.202
ALL: Hear, hear.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.845
Perhaps you'd like to add a
toast of your own, Miss Evans.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.418
It's considered unlucky
to toast without a glass.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.588
Fergus, would you get a glass
for Miss Evans, please?

32:02.621 --> 32:03.655

in case a problem occurs.

much from the back of a limo,

40:27.192 --> 40:30.395
but you can see everything
from the seat of a horse.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.899
You ride every night?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.502
It's the only time when I
really feel like myself.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.069
I think that's why I
love New York so much.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.138
Nobody knows me there.

40:40.171 --> 40:43.842
I can stand in line, get
shouted at by taxi drivers.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.010
That's what you want?

40:45.043 --> 40:47.245
You'd be surprised what you
want when you can't have it.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.614
(CHUCKLES)
We should swap lives.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.983
I stand in line and get
yelled at on a daily basis.

40:52.017 --> 40:54.720
You know,
I met my wife in New York.

40:54.753 --> 40:58.389
Her family was as royal and
stuffy as mine, but she wasn't.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.058
We eloped.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.727
Vegas?
Niagara Falls.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.663
My father would have
disowned me if he could.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.400
He was a much better king
than he was a father.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.239
I probably shouldn't say this.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.474
No, please, say it.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.045
Do you ever feel like

41:20.078 --> 41:22.180
maybe you've become
a little like him?

41:25.617 --> 41:27.719
I'm afraid I might be
going down the same path.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.221
Paths change all the time.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.191
Not in my world.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.966
Fergus tells me
you're an artist.

41:42.467 --> 41:45.136
Oh, he saw a few paintings
at my house, that's all.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.372
That's not how
he described them.

41:47.405 --> 41:50.676
I had a show once,
a couple years back.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.779
Didn't go so well.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.615
So, now I just paint for myself.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.249
Well, that's a shame.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.317
I'd really like
to see your work.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.820
So would he.

42:01.853 --> 42:02.988
Where are your manners?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.690
There's an artist
in our presence.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.561
(CHUCKLES)
You taught him that?

42:09.595 --> 42:11.296
He's taught me a few things too.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.121
It's so beautiful.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.790
Yes, it is.

42:55.807 --> 42:56.808
(CHUCKLES)

42:59.945 --> 43:02.648
Thank you for
the royal treatment.

43:02.681 --> 43:05.550
And thank you for treating me
like a normal person.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.218
I'm not sure
that's an even exchange.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.319
Trust me, it is.

43:19.998 --> 43:22.668
I'd shake your hand,
but I know you don't shake.

43:22.701 --> 43:23.902
(BOTH LAUGHING)

43:27.605 --> 43:29.507
Good night, Your Highness.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.409
Max. Please.

43:33.879 --> 43:35.947
Well, I should probably...

43:37.515 --> 43:38.984
Good night, Allie.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.121
Good night.

43:57.068 --> 43:59.705
You wanted to see me, sir?

43:59.738 --> 44:02.941
Yes. Lady Celia's
arriving tomorrow.

44:03.842 --> 44:05.877
Make sure her room is ready.

44:05.911 --> 44:08.279
But she's not due
until Christmas Eve.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.716
There's been
a small change of plan.

44:17.555 --> 44:20.091
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

44:20.125 --> 44:23.528
Good morning, Mrs. Claiborne.
Gingerbread cookies!

44:23.561 --> 44:26.264
Good morning, dear.
And how was the rest of your evening?

44:27.498 --> 44:30.068
Ah, just another
night in the castle.

44:30.101 --> 44:32.904
It's funny, I can't
remember the last time

44:32.938 --> 44:34.439
the King took anyone riding.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.843
On second thought, yes, I can.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.178
Never.

44:41.246 --> 44:42.480
THEODORA:
Is that gingerbread?

44:43.481 --> 44:45.516
It's not for breakfast.

44:45.550 --> 44:47.652
Good morning, Theodora.

44:47.685 --> 44:50.188
I saw you and
Father riding last night.

44:50.221 --> 44:53.158
Next time, don't hold
onto the saddle horn.

44:55.626 --> 44:56.995
Thank you.

44:57.028 --> 44:59.697
Should there be
a next time, I won't.

45:03.735 --> 45:05.570
Morning, Your Highness.
Morning, Fergus.

45:05.603 --> 45:07.873
Chancellor. Your breakfast.

45:12.410 --> 45:13.779
ALL:
♪ O Christmas tree

45:13.812 --> 45:15.613
♪ O Christmas tree

45:15.646 --> 45:18.817
♪ Your leaves are so unchanging

45:18.850 --> 45:22.120
♪ Not only green

45:22.153 --> 45:25.356
♪ But also when
it's cold and drear

45:28.326 --> 45:31.930
♪ Such pleasure

45:31.963 --> 45:33.064
Yes!

45:33.098 --> 45:35.533
What wonderful
acoustics in here.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.803
♪ O Christmas tree
O Christmas tree ♪

45:37.836 --> 45:39.704
Not the original German.

45:40.772 --> 45:42.908
A Christmas song
is a Christmas song.

45:54.052 --> 45:55.821
A royal car has arrived,
Your Highness.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.889
Are we expecting someone?
FERGUS: It's not on the schedule.

45:58.824 --> 46:00.792
Ah, that must be Lady Celia.

46:12.537 --> 46:14.739
I thought she wasn't arriving
until the day of the ball.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.141
I invited her a few days early.

46:16.174 --> 46:17.976
After all,
she'll be family soon.

46:18.009 --> 46:19.177
That's not your decision.

46:19.210 --> 46:20.311
Someone has to make one.

46:20.345 --> 46:21.880
The monarchy needs a queen.

46:26.684 --> 46:29.487
Announcing Lady
Celia of Luxembourg.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.657
Maximillian, isn't this all
just wonderful?

46:32.690 --> 46:34.592
Words cannot describe it.

46:37.028 --> 46:40.431
Theodora, I haven't seen you
since you were tiny.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.001
No.
You saw me three months ago.

46:43.701 --> 46:44.870
And at Easter.

46:44.903 --> 46:47.338
And last year at
the Christmas gala.

46:47.372 --> 46:49.540
I suppose I should
remember these things.

46:49.574 --> 46:51.309
But I did remember this.

46:54.913 --> 46:57.215
Thank you.
I'll open it on Christmas.

46:57.248 --> 47:00.651
No, open it now, dear.
I can't wait to see it on you.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.821
Ah...

47:06.491 --> 47:09.327
Ballet. My favorite thing.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.396
Oh, and you're just the right
age to start lessons.

47:11.429 --> 47:14.699
You are going to make
an adorable ballerina.

47:14.732 --> 47:17.969
Lady Celia, this is
Miss Evans, my governess.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.671
Nice to meet you, Lady Celia.

47:20.705 --> 47:23.674
An American governess.
How odd.

47:24.309 --> 47:25.310
(CLEARS THROAT)

47:26.611 --> 47:27.678
I couldn't agree more.

47:27.712 --> 47:29.547
Let's all move to
the drawing room, shall we?

47:29.580 --> 47:31.149
Your Highness.

47:38.456 --> 47:40.125
Who is she?

47:40.158 --> 47:41.492
The horrible lady

47:41.526 --> 47:43.228
my father's supposed to marry.

47:44.896 --> 47:46.331
Hmm.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.867
What better place to announce
it than the Christmas gala?

47:49.901 --> 47:52.737
How perfect.
I vote for a spring wedding.

47:53.304 --> 47:55.040
Of what year?

47:55.073 --> 47:58.843
Aren't you silly.
This year, of course.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.745
We'll send the invitations
out on the first.

48:00.778 --> 48:02.780
Absolutely.
That way it gives anyone who counts

48:02.813 --> 48:04.182
plenty of time to clear their schedule.
(CHUCKLES)

48:06.117 --> 48:08.253
The wedding is being held
at the castle, I assume?

48:08.286 --> 48:09.487
Mmm.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.589
Just as Maximillian's
father's was.

48:11.622 --> 48:15.260
And perhaps a honeymoon
in the Maldives?

48:15.293 --> 48:16.928
You're planning
my honeymoon too?

48:16.962 --> 48:20.865
Our honeymoon.
And I adore the Maldives.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.434
Unless, of course,
you prefer somewhere else?

48:23.468 --> 48:24.535
No, not really.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.471
Father, you don't look too well.

48:26.504 --> 48:28.739
Maybe you should go to bed.
I'll take you.

48:28.773 --> 48:30.108
I'm fine, Theodora.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.576
It is getting late.

48:31.609 --> 48:34.779
You must be very tired, Theodora.
(LAUGHING)

48:34.812 --> 48:38.249
Oh, I never sleep.
In fact, if you were to get married,

48:38.283 --> 48:39.584
you'd never be alone together

48:39.617 --> 48:41.752
because I'd always be
there day and night.

48:41.786 --> 48:42.920
Theodora.

48:42.954 --> 48:45.056
But I have
questions for Lady Celia.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.058
Questions?
Do you like bugs?

48:47.092 --> 48:48.826
As long as they're in
the ground, I suppose.

48:48.859 --> 48:51.296
Do you know how to make
ornaments out of pinecones

48:51.329 --> 48:53.464
or mulligan stew?
Theodora, that's enough.

48:53.498 --> 48:56.634
Are you being nice to me just
'cause you want to marry my father?

48:56.667 --> 48:58.069
Do you even love my father?

48:58.103 --> 48:59.337
Theodora!

49:04.275 --> 49:05.343
ALLIE: Teddy...

49:07.378 --> 49:08.446
Excuse me.

49:08.479 --> 49:11.249
Your Highness,
let the governess handle it.

49:12.883 --> 49:13.884
Your Highness?

49:19.357 --> 49:20.658
Teddy!

49:23.594 --> 49:25.330
Teddy, wait!

49:26.331 --> 49:27.598
Teddy!

49:30.768 --> 49:32.570
I know you're in here.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.743
Theodora.

49:38.776 --> 49:40.411
Theodora, come out this minute.

49:44.682 --> 49:46.384
She's locked it
from the outside.

49:54.292 --> 49:55.760
You're not gonna hit
me with that, are you?

49:55.793 --> 49:58.096
I'm going to break a window,
Your Highness.

49:59.164 --> 50:00.598
It's still Max.

50:00.998 --> 50:01.999
(SIGHS)

50:04.235 --> 50:06.271
Don't believe
everything you're thinking.

50:06.304 --> 50:08.206
You don't know
what I'm thinking.

50:08.239 --> 50:09.974
That I'm a jerk who
wanted to kiss you

50:10.007 --> 50:12.610
when I'm meant to
be getting married?

50:12.643 --> 50:13.678
So you do know
what I'm thinking.

50:13.711 --> 50:14.979
Can I at least explain?

50:15.012 --> 50:16.214
There's nothing to explain.

50:16.247 --> 50:18.483
This union was
arranged by the throne.

50:18.516 --> 50:19.717
Aren't you the throne?

50:19.750 --> 50:21.186
No. I just sit on it.

50:21.219 --> 50:22.853
Apparently,
the monarchy's only popular

50:22.887 --> 50:24.789
when we're getting
married or having babies.

50:24.822 --> 50:28.793
Celia and I were meant to be
married years ago, but...

50:28.826 --> 50:30.595
We see each other occasionally.

50:30.628 --> 50:33.264
It's just always been assumed
that we'd be together.

50:34.132 --> 50:36.601
You make a beautiful couple.

50:36.634 --> 50:38.536
And I hope that you'll be happy.

50:54.252 --> 50:56.087
Spare key. Sorry.

51:13.003 --> 51:14.705
Inside, Theodora.

51:20.145 --> 51:21.712
You're not going to punish me?

51:22.113 --> 51:23.214
No.

51:24.115 --> 51:25.116
Hmm.

51:25.983 --> 51:27.218
(APPLAUDING)

51:29.887 --> 51:31.556
Hello, everyone,
and welcome again.

51:31.589 --> 51:33.558
It's hard to believe
another year has gone by.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.826
I hope it's been
a good one for all of you.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.094
(APPLAUDING)

51:39.164 --> 51:41.632
MAN: There are rumors
of a royal wedding!

51:41.666 --> 51:44.068
Father always told me
not to believe rumors.

51:46.036 --> 51:49.174
I tell my daughter many things,
most of which she ignores.

51:49.207 --> 51:50.608
(CROWD LAUGHS)

51:50.641 --> 51:54.512
Theodora, would you please hang
the royal ornament on the tree?

51:54.545 --> 51:56.514
I'll hang this one instead.

51:57.782 --> 51:59.083
(APPLAUDING)

52:01.519 --> 52:02.920
That's sweet.

52:10.495 --> 52:11.962
A picture, Your Highness.

52:13.364 --> 52:15.866
Look at us.
Just like a family already.

52:21.539 --> 52:23.140
(KNOCKING)

52:23.174 --> 52:25.276
Don't worry, Miss Wick.
I didn't make the bed.

52:26.711 --> 52:29.113
It's not Miss Wick.
May I come in?

52:31.682 --> 52:32.717
Of course.

52:33.784 --> 52:34.985
What a surprise.

52:35.019 --> 52:37.688
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this unexpected visit?

52:38.989 --> 52:41.091
You and Maximillian
seem rather chummy.

52:41.125 --> 52:44.995
Well, we do go way
back to five days ago.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.702
I'm just the governess.

52:56.874 --> 52:58.776
I owe you an apology,
Miss Evans.

52:58.809 --> 53:01.646
I'm afraid I'm quite insecure
when it comes to Maximillian.

53:01.679 --> 53:04.449
We were supposed to
be married years ago.

53:04.482 --> 53:07.618
This is my second chance, and I'd
hate for him to slip away again.

53:07.652 --> 53:10.020
You have nothing to
worry about from me.

53:10.054 --> 53:12.022
The truth is, I don't believe
he's ever been quite comfortable

53:12.056 --> 53:14.158
as a royal or a king.

53:15.626 --> 53:18.195
Perhaps you could put a good
word in with Theodora for me.

53:18.229 --> 53:19.697
Of course.

53:19.730 --> 53:21.332
I'm glad we had this chat.

53:25.102 --> 53:26.237
(DOOR CLOSING)

53:35.246 --> 53:36.947
Fresh snow! Look!

53:39.584 --> 53:42.119
It's gonna be a white Christmas.

53:42.152 --> 53:43.688
Come on, let's go.

54:00.605 --> 54:01.606
He's perfect.

54:13.551 --> 54:15.052
Where's Theodora?

54:15.085 --> 54:16.687
I don't know, Your Highness.

54:16.721 --> 54:18.155
I'll go and find her.

54:21.359 --> 54:22.727
Oh, good one!

54:24.929 --> 54:26.864
Yes!
Princess Theodora,

54:26.897 --> 54:28.232
you're due in for breakfast.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.269
Oh, you cheeky little monkey!

54:34.505 --> 54:35.640
Gotcha!

54:36.807 --> 54:37.875
Whoa!

54:37.908 --> 54:39.444
Two against one, huh?

54:39.477 --> 54:41.045
Come on!
Come on, Helen!

54:41.346 --> 54:42.480
Come on!

54:44.582 --> 54:45.816
(LAUGHING)

54:47.518 --> 54:48.653
ALLIE: Nice shot, Fergus.

54:48.686 --> 54:50.988
Come on, guys.
Come on, join my team.

54:51.021 --> 54:52.523
ALLIE: This means war!

55:00.598 --> 55:02.232
(CLEARS THROAT)

55:02.266 --> 55:04.835
Pardon the interruption,
Your Highness,

55:04.869 --> 55:07.137
but I can't seem to
find the staff anywhere.

55:08.072 --> 55:09.507
And my tea is cold.

55:12.276 --> 55:14.111
(LAUGHING)

55:14.144 --> 55:15.446
ALLIE: Come on, guys!
We need help!

55:18.483 --> 55:21.919
Would you care to
explain yourselves?

55:24.321 --> 55:25.690
That's not funny.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.532
What are they doing?

55:38.102 --> 55:39.136
ALLIE: Oh, no.

55:43.107 --> 55:44.675
Father.

55:44.709 --> 55:46.411
Your Highness,
please don't blame them.

55:48.546 --> 55:51.682
Is this a snowball
fight or a tea party?

55:53.083 --> 55:54.151
Oh!

55:54.184 --> 55:55.820
Your Majesty!

55:55.853 --> 55:57.321
ALLIE: Nice shot,
Your Highness!

56:00.558 --> 56:02.693
Something needs to be done
about this governess.

56:02.727 --> 56:04.028
(LAUGHING)

56:13.604 --> 56:16.373
I think we'll make this
a new Christmas Eve tradition.

56:18.208 --> 56:19.243
Come on.

56:20.778 --> 56:21.879
Lady Celia.

56:27.317 --> 56:28.318
(DINGS)

56:34.892 --> 56:38.228
Well done, girls.
These look delicious.
Oh!

56:39.096 --> 56:40.164
It's hot.

56:40.798 --> 56:42.500
Can we make more?

56:42.533 --> 56:46.170
Sure, but this time,
you're gonna do the measuring.

56:46.203 --> 56:48.372
All right, we need
one-and-three-quarters cups of sugar,

56:48.405 --> 56:49.874
but the one cup is being used,

56:49.907 --> 56:51.676
so we'll use seven quarters cups

56:51.709 --> 56:53.277
because four
quarters is the same as one.

56:53.911 --> 56:56.514
Is that like fractions?

56:56.547 --> 56:59.484
I don't get all this math stuff.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.719
Oh, it's easy.
It's just different ways
of saying the same thing.

57:01.752 --> 57:05.322
So, one cookie is
the same as two halves,

57:05.355 --> 57:08.659
which is the same as
four quarters, see?

57:08.693 --> 57:10.461
That is pretty easy.

57:10.495 --> 57:12.830
So, if I have two quarters,

57:15.766 --> 57:18.102
that makes a half.
Yes.

57:18.135 --> 57:22.740
And if I add one more quarter,
that makes three quarters.

57:23.674 --> 57:25.142
And just one more quarter

57:25.175 --> 57:26.977
makes a whole.
You got it.

57:27.011 --> 57:29.547
If I add another three
quarters, that would make...

57:29.580 --> 57:32.550
Okay, that's enough math,
you little sugar monster.

57:33.183 --> 57:34.585
It's almost dinnertime.

57:37.221 --> 57:39.023
A toast.

57:39.056 --> 57:41.191
To the future of Winshire.

57:41.959 --> 57:43.193
To us.

57:45.395 --> 57:48.232
Miss Evans and I
made Christmas cookies.

57:48.265 --> 57:50.167
Who wants one?
I do.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.141
Hmm.

57:57.642 --> 57:59.109
Delicious.

57:59.143 --> 58:00.745
Don't you want one, Lady Celia?

58:01.579 --> 58:02.980
Of course I do.

58:09.954 --> 58:12.422
Miss Evans' family recipe.

58:12.456 --> 58:14.158
Is there no end to your talents?

58:14.191 --> 58:16.594
There most definitely is.

58:16.627 --> 58:18.529
Well, you certainly
have a way with children.

58:19.429 --> 58:20.665
Thank you.

58:20.698 --> 58:23.300
Well, perhaps you have some
advice for Maximillian and I.

58:23.333 --> 58:26.403
After all, we do plan on having
a few of our own, don't we?

58:27.137 --> 58:29.106
I doubt I have much to add.

58:29.139 --> 58:32.743
Miss Evans says that you
should never yell at a child.

58:32.777 --> 58:36.246
If you're angry, just lean in
and whisper quietly.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.082
It's scarier.

58:38.115 --> 58:39.884
(CHUCKLES)
That was more of a joke.

58:41.351 --> 58:45.089
Miss Evans says that good
parenting lies somewhere between

58:45.122 --> 58:46.857
"Don't do that"
and "What the heck."

58:46.891 --> 58:48.559
All right, Theodora,
I think we get the picture.

58:48.593 --> 58:51.996
Oh, no, do, please, go on.
This is fascinating.

58:52.597 --> 58:53.931
Miss Evans?

58:54.298 --> 58:55.299
Well, I...

58:56.366 --> 59:00.304
I guess if I had advice,
it would be

59:00.337 --> 59:02.506
always kiss your
children good night,

59:03.674 --> 59:05.042
even if they're asleep.

59:09.747 --> 59:15.352
Well, I think it's safe to say that Miss
Evans will be very hard to replace.

59:15.385 --> 59:18.656
Fortunately,
she won't be replaced.

59:18.689 --> 59:21.258
Theodora won't be needing a
governess after the holidays.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.093
Really?

59:23.127 --> 59:24.528
Oh...

59:24.561 --> 59:25.796
You didn't tell her?

59:26.797 --> 59:28.398
Tell me what?

59:28.432 --> 59:32.402
Your father and I have been discussing
your enrollment at Le Rosey.

59:32.436 --> 59:33.904
You're sending me
to boarding school?

59:33.938 --> 59:35.272
Nothing's been decided yet.

59:36.841 --> 59:38.175
Theodora!

59:39.744 --> 59:41.245
I asked you not to say anything.

59:41.278 --> 59:42.546
We can't keep
replacing governesses.

59:42.579 --> 59:43.748
She's only 10!

59:43.781 --> 59:44.949
You were only eight.

59:46.751 --> 59:48.719
I went to Switzerland
when I was Theodora's age.

59:48.753 --> 59:51.722
It is a wonderful training
ground for young ladies.

59:51.756 --> 59:53.123
And we can always visit,

59:53.157 --> 59:54.625
and she'll come
home on the holidays.

59:59.496 --> 01:00:00.765
I lost my mum.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:04.001
Now I'm losing my father to her.

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:06.103
You won't lose him, Teddy.

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:07.905
They're sending me away.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.174
He's going to
forget all about me.

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.742
He won't.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:14.478
You are pretty
darn unforgettable.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:19.950
No matter how it
seems right now,

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:22.252
I promise you,

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:26.056
you are his
crowning achievement.

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:31.361
I know this is hard,

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.898
but you can get
through anything.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:36.300
Just like the Evans, right?

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.368
(CHUCKLES)

01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:41.706
Right.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.111
(SNIFFLES)

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:00.825
Your Highness.

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:03.560
Another Christmas Eve,
another gala.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:06.831
Hmm. This one will prove
unforgettable, I'm sure.

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:10.334
I think Lady Celia would
be quite happy with this.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.739
MAXIMILLIAN:
That's my mother's ring.

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:17.574
And she would have wanted it
on Celia's hand.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:19.744
It belonged on the hand
of Theodora's mother.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.511
Well,
if you'd had a royal wedding

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:23.213
instead of eloped,
it would have been.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:27.684
But let's look to the future,
Maximillian.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:29.053
Believe me, I'm trying.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.855
I can assure you,

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:32.656
it's the right thing to do.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:03.020
Happy Christmas Eve!
How's the King?

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.189
About to
announce his engagement.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.456
He's proposing?

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.059
To Lady Celia of Luxembourg.

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:11.461
What? When did this happen?

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:13.597
Apparently,
before they were born.

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.233
I'm sorry.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.534
It's okay.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.702
Gotta go.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.370
Merry Christmas.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.705
Merry Christmas.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.389
My mum used to brush my hair.

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:43.693
I think I'll use that
as my special memory.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.768
Okay, tiara or no tiara?

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:53.037
No tiara.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.571
All right, tiara it is.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.550
You look just like a princess.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:24.068
You've always been
honest with me, Fergus.

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:25.569
I have, yes.

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:30.040
Am I doing the right thing here?

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:34.144
You're doing what's right
for your country, Max,

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.113
and what your
father would've wanted.

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.649
That's not an answer.

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:41.952
Then I'm afraid this is
one time when I am unable

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:43.787
to be honest with you,
Your Highness.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.737
Maybe you could give
Lady Celia another chance.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:02.839
I know you don't like her,

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:05.409
but, hey, you didn't
like me at first either.

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:08.212
Sometimes people
can surprise you.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.215
But why can't you be my mother?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.953
Well, first of all,
I'd have to marry your father,

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:18.122
and we both know
that's impossible.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.892
Why is it impossible?

01:04:21.926 --> 01:04:23.994
He's better when
he's around you.

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:26.363
He's himself.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.265
(KNOCKING)
MAXIMILLIAN: Theodora, are you ready?

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:29.366
She is.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.211
You look so much
like your mother.

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:44.014
I'm sorry, Father.

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.050
Why would you be sorry?

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.452
I know you don't like
being reminded of her.

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:50.120
Theodora,

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:53.623
it's her memory

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:57.394
and you that keeps me going.

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:01.098
But you never talk about her.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:03.833
That doesn't mean I
don't think about her

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.202
every single day.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.005
Theodora,

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:11.908
we can talk about
her whenever you want.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:13.877
My father

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.514
taught me to keep
everything inside,

01:05:19.183 --> 01:05:21.585
but I don't think
we'll be doing that anymore.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.595
Shall I take
Theodora to the ballroom?

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:34.531
I think I'll do it.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:40.437
Father, may I invite Miss Evans?

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.406
She's never been to a ball.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.541
Thank you, sweetie, but I
really don't belong there.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.644
I disagree.
We'll see you downstairs.

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:57.587
Cheers!

What are you
doing in the corner?

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:16.406
Hoping to get uninvited.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.009
You'll do no such thing.

and you're going to too.

Ah!

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:27.017
Your Highness.
You look lovely.

01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:28.885
Just like a queen, Lady Celia.

Thank you, Theodora.

01:06:30.054 --> 01:06:32.122

bit the princess.

Shall we?

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.625
If you don't mind,
I'd like to walk Theodora in.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.994
Chancellor,
would you escort Lady Celia?

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:39.263
It would be my honor.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.931
Lady Celia, this way.

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:46.170
Are you ready?

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:47.804
Yes.

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.312
Whose is it?

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:56.580
Oh, I was young once.

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:58.948
I wore it to
a very special dance

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.952
with a very
handsome man years ago.

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:04.921
It's beautiful.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:08.692

She spent months making it.

to that very handsome man?

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.722
We were far too young,
I'm afraid.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:41.658
He was in the army,
and he was sent away.

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:44.461
We just lost touch.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:46.963
ALLIE:
You never saw him again?

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:53.303
Oh, yes, I saw him,
but by then, I was married,

01:07:53.337 --> 01:07:56.306
and my husband passed,
so too much time.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:01.745
Anyway, at my age,
thoughts of romance

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:04.614
are about as unlikely
as an eclipse of the moon.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.753
You do realize there are
several eclipses every year.

(APPLAUDING)

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.202
May I have the first dance?

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.108
(VIOLIN PLAYING)

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.814
She really is rather beautiful.

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.617
She's very sweet.
Yes.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.363
Yes.
How sweet.

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:30.600
Is that true?

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:49.386
Announcing Miss
Allison Evans of Brooklyn.

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.122
Brooklyn?

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:55.859
I've never heard of her.

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:07.771
What's she doing?
She's a governess.

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:08.905
Not tonight.

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:16.780
(APPLAUDING)

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.284
So much for being invisible.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:34.898
Dance with me.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.024
(APPLAUDING)

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:45.635
Your Highness, may I have
Lady Celia for a dance?

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:47.036
Of course, Count.

01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:00.750
It seems you're the only
one who hasn't danced yet.

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:02.786
Fergus hasn't.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.556
I think I'd
rather dance with you.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:13.497
Your judgment is
obviously impaired.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.031
It has been for some time.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:19.963
I'll definitely remember this
for the rest of my life.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.030
So will I.

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:26.803
May I borrow him back,
Miss Evans?

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.272
Of course.

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:36.813
She looks quite
beautiful in your dress.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.648
She looks lovely.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:41.217
As did you once, I recall.

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:47.290
I'm not blind.
Celia...

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:50.259
I know you don't love me,
at least not like you used to,

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.928
and I'm okay with that for now

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:53.730
'cause I think one day you will.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:55.865
And that's enough for you?

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.734
We're going to have
a wonderful marriage.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.435
Please just give us a chance.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:07.811
Now, let's take
a peek at that ring.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:09.946
Isn't it bad luck to see
it before the proposal?

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.247
I'll take the risk.

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:16.019
That's strange.
Where is it?

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:17.487
When did you last see it?

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:19.523
Earlier this evening,
in my study.

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.958
Well,
I hate to state the obvious.

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:24.427
I trust my staff implicitly.
They've been with me for years.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.695
Not all of them.

01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:27.731
Miss Wick came from your staff.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.432
Well, I'm not
talking about Miss Wick.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.802
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:34.270
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.505
She's not a thief.

01:14:35.539 --> 01:14:36.673
I know you're fond of her,

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:38.675
but what do you
really know about her?

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:39.943
(CLEARS THROAT)
Excuse me, Your Highness.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.444
A few pictures with
the Duke and Duchess.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:42.846
It'll be good for relations.

01:14:43.513 --> 01:14:44.914
Lady Celia.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:48.317
No, you were.

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:49.619
Seriously...

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:50.887
(MUMBLING)

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.491
Lady Celia.

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:58.427
Could I have
a word between bites?

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:00.864
Of course.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:03.366
It appears my
engagement ring is missing.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.169
Really? That's awful.

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:07.804
Yes, I thought you might be able

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.372
to shed some light
on the situation,

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:11.074
before it escalates any further.

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:15.679
Me? No.
I have no light to shed.

01:15:15.712 --> 01:15:17.313
Because there will
be a room search,

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.682
and if it's found
amongst your things,

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:20.116
the authorities will be called.

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:21.484
What are you trying to say?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.586
I think it's clear.

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:23.720
Be clearer.

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.555
Well, last week you were a maid.

01:15:25.589 --> 01:15:27.056
Now you're a governess.

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:30.126
Where will this dazzling
climb up the ladder end?

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:33.262
A 19-carat diamond
could buy a whole new life.

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:34.931
I have a life.

Do you?

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.801
Look,
I might be a lot of things,

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:39.836
but I've never taken
anything in my life.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.073
She doesn't steal.
She's an Evans.

Thank you, Teddy,

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:49.345
but I think it might
be best if I just leave.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.781
You can't.

leaving now would be best.

Give me the ring, Teddy.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.929
I just didn't want Father
to put it on her finger.

and you can stay.

Tell them it was me.

It's important that Theodora and
Lady Celia get off to a good start.

01:17:14.698 --> 01:17:17.300
It was found on my dresser,
where I left it.

I'll pack my bags.

and I'd do it again.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.122

that halfway around the world

Good evening, everyone.

01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:34.770
This is normally when I
would make my traditional

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:36.239
night before Christmas speech,

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.174
which you've no
doubt memorized by now.

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:41.845
But tonight I would like
to say something else.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:45.081
Christmas is
a time to come together.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:50.053
It's about family,
giving and love.

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:53.990
And recently, I've come to realize
that while I am your king,

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:56.659
first and foremost,
I'm a parent.

01:19:58.194 --> 01:20:02.065
I know this realm needs a queen,

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:04.333
but right now,
my daughter needs a father.

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:07.136
I know many of you were expecting
a wedding announcement,

01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:09.472
and I hope that one day soon
you'll have that.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:11.074
But not tonight.
(ALL SIGHS)

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:13.142

Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:22.818
Enjoy the ball.

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.221
Celia, please, wait.

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:26.622
No. I've waited
long enough for you.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.758
Listen, you deserve more than an arrangement.
We both do.

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:33.162
I really am very sorry.

01:20:34.297 --> 01:20:35.598
I hope one day we
can get past this.

01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:37.266
Well, I can assure you we won't.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.567
And, frankly, I'm relieved

01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:40.136
I don't have to spend the rest
of my life with that child.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.771
That child is my daughter!

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:44.807
And unlike you,
one day she will be queen.

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:49.845
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:53.082
Yes, I do.
This is my house, my family.

01:20:53.116 --> 01:20:55.651
Who I marry and
when is my decision.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.221
Your father would
be so disappointed.

01:20:58.254 --> 01:21:00.756
I can live with that, and if
you can't, you can leave.

I love you, Teddy.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:19.909
And you're not going
to boarding school.

01:21:19.943 --> 01:21:21.377
You're gonna stay
right here with me.

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:05.708
I think you strayed
from your path a little.

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:07.443
My path's changed.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:12.348
It turns out I couldn't marry
someone I didn't love.

01:24:13.216 --> 01:24:14.783
You didn't propose?

01:24:15.318 --> 01:24:16.452
No.

01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:22.725
I'm in love with someone else.

01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:25.794
But what about the throne?

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:28.697
It survived a thousand years.
It can survive a girl from Brooklyn.

01:24:31.367 --> 01:24:33.636
Are you sure about this?

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:35.804
The fact is you had
me at "sewing kit."
