I'd call him resourceful.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.581
And...dangerous.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.084
And yet. let us say that
the hard lesson
of imprisonment

28:38.175 --> 28:42.418
also taught him to
respect his place in the
larger scheme of things.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.262
Such a man might be
useful on the outside.

28:45.349 --> 28:49.467

Earth Republic.
would he not?

28:50.312 --> 28:52.143

such as yourself?

28:54.942 --> 28:57.729
Such a man as you describe.
indeed. he would be...

28:58.487 --> 28:59.977
He would be
of great value to me.

complete picture.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.670

30:42.758 --> 30:46.342

of an apocalyptic war

30:46.428 --> 30:49.135
and the near destruction
of the Earth's surface.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.635

very entertaining.
if a little facile.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.386
