The Slitheen don't invade

of the galaxy, telekinetic

24:24.596 --> 24:25.964
-You've been here
millions of years.
-(LAUGHS EVILLY)

24:26.031 --> 24:28.400
You've seen us evolve.
Don't we matter to you?

24:28.466 --> 24:30.635
<i>Only my purpose matters.</i>

24:30.702 --> 24:32.270
You can change your purpose.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.807
<i>No. I told you, Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>we all have a purpose.</i>

24:35.874 --> 24:38.710
<i>Yours is to die so that</i>
<i>the Xylok will live.</i>

24:38.777 --> 24:42.981
<i>After all,</i>
<i>what life do you have,</i>
<i>alone in your attic?</i>

24:43.048 --> 24:45.283
Alone? You think I'm alone?

24:45.350 --> 24:46.685
You think I'm defenceless?

24:46.751 --> 24:49.554
Well, meet my dog!
K9, protect me!

24:49.621 --> 24:50.822
K9: <i>Affirmative, Mistress.</i>

24:52.757 --> 24:53.892
<i>Maximum defence mode.</i>

24:56.228 --> 24:58.496
<i>Take care, Mistress,</i>
<i>and you, young Master.</i>

25:03.101 --> 25:05.937
<i>Safe to proceed, Mistress,</i>
<i>I have the unit covered.</i>

25:12.410 --> 25:14.846
<i>Do you wish me to</i>
<i>continue firing, Mistress?</i>

25:14.913 --> 25:16.514
Just be ready if I need you,
K9.

25:16.581 --> 25:19.150
<i>-Very good, Mistress.</i>
-A robot dog. Called K9?

25:19.217 --> 25:20.619
<i>Affirmative.</i>

25:20.685 --> 25:22.153
I am dreaming, aren't I?

25:22.220 --> 25:23.822
MR SMITH: <i>What have you done</i>
<i>to me, Sarah Jane?</i>

25:24.856 --> 25:27.592
<i>I feel... I feel strange.</i>

25:27.659 --> 25:29.394
It's a computer virus,
Mr Smith.

25:29.461 --> 25:32.797
It's closing down
your databanks.
You're losing your memory.

25:32.864 --> 25:37.435
<i>The speed of light is</i>
<i>36, no, 84...</i>

25:37.502 --> 25:43.408
<i>The Metrabeelen Cosmic Cluster</i>
<i>is home to 68,000</i>
<i>life forms... 67...</i>

25:43.475 --> 25:45.810
<i>I'm forgetting it all.</i>
<i>Sarah Jane! Help me!</i>

25:45.877 --> 25:48.246
Without your memories,
you have no purpose, Mr Smith.

25:48.313 --> 25:50.548
Without purpose, you
can't destroy the Earth.

25:50.615 --> 25:55.086
Put the moon into its original
orbit before it's too late
and set Luke free now!

25:55.153 --> 25:58.156
<i>-I've forgotten my purpose!</i>
-Your purpose is to save
the Earth, Mr Smith.

25:58.223 --> 26:01.126
That is your new purpose.
To save the Earth.

26:01.192 --> 26:04.129
<i>Save the Earth. Yes.</i>

26:04.195 --> 26:07.098
<i>I have a purpose.</i>
<i>Thank you, Sarah Jane.</i>

26:08.533 --> 26:10.669
<i>The unit is non-functional.</i>

26:15.407 --> 26:18.076
You did it! It worked!
The moon's going back!

26:18.143 --> 26:21.146
<i>Is everything satisfactory,</i>
<i>Mistress?</i>

26:21.212 --> 26:22.881
Affirmative, K9.

26:22.948 --> 26:25.283
<i>Must return to the</i>
<i>distortion, Mistress.</i>

26:25.350 --> 26:28.920
<i>Without my</i>
<i>immediate attention,</i>
<i>black hole will turn critical</i>

26:28.987 --> 26:32.223
<i>in 0.42</i>
<i>time spatial increments.</i>

26:32.290 --> 26:34.526
Go now. Good dog.
I'll see you again soon.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.630
-Mum?
-Oh, Luke.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.705
SARAH JANE:
<i>I've seen amazing things</i>
<i>out there in space.</i>

26:46.771 --> 26:49.407
<i>But strange things can happen</i>
<i>wherever you are.</i>

26:53.578 --> 26:54.713
There they go.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.382
Back to
Raxacoricofallapatorius.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.117
And good riddance.

26:59.184 --> 27:02.420
-Will they be back?
-Oh, I expect so,
sooner or later.

27:02.487 --> 27:03.755
What about Mr Smith?

27:03.822 --> 27:05.090
Yeah, can we ever
trust him again?

27:05.156 --> 27:07.325
The Armageddon Code
has wiped his circuits.

27:07.392 --> 27:09.627
He'll reboot
with a new purpose,

27:09.694 --> 27:11.863
to safeguard the world.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.999
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-MARIA: Mum!

27:14.065 --> 27:17.135
Oh, we were just saying
what a beautiful night.
Please, come and join us.

27:27.512 --> 27:30.315
SARAH JANE: <i>I have learnt</i>
<i>that life on Earth</i>
<i>can be an adventure, too.</i>

27:30.382 --> 27:32.784
<i>You never know</i>
<i>what you might find.</i>

27:32.851 --> 27:36.821
<i>In all the universe,</i>
<i>I never expected</i>
<i>to find a family.</i>
