02:02.406 --> 02:03.756
Rachel.

02:04.376 --> 02:06.459
It's midnight, they're coming.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.332
Edward.

02:46.127 --> 02:51.791
<i># Girl child, boy child, listen well</i>

03:14.518 --> 03:20.182
<i># Good sister, good brother be #</i>

03:20.262 --> 03:25.960
<i># Follow well these cautions three #</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:31.705
<i># Long as your blood be ours alone #</i>

03:31.785 --> 03:37.843
<i># We'll see you ever from below ##</i>

04:56.087 --> 04:57.969
Happy birthday, Edward.

05:04.102 --> 05:05.784
Stop.

05:06.641 --> 05:08.456
It hurts my eyes.

05:14.990 --> 05:17.371
Aren't you going to wish the same to me?

05:18.633 --> 05:20.649
What is there to be happy for?

05:24.978 --> 05:28.605
Well, we're to take
our walk today, aren't we?

05:29.285 --> 05:31.135
To celebrate?

05:32.994 --> 05:34.785
Celebrate?

05:34.865 --> 05:36.713
There's no hope for us now.

05:40.041 --> 05:43.290
- Edward, I know you're angry...
- It's not my anger you need to fear!

05:48.525 --> 05:50.516
They keep us safe.

05:50.596 --> 05:52.901
Can you not do the few things they ask of us?

05:57.676 --> 06:00.359
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing yet.

06:01.951 --> 06:06.092
- The first chime had struck Rachel.
- Edward, don't be like this, please.

06:08.465 --> 06:10.680
Not on our 18th birthday.

06:14.444 --> 06:16.650
I didn't mean to take the risk.

06:17.649 --> 06:22.179
It's only that I was out by the lake.
I was reading and I lost track of time.

06:22.259 --> 06:24.141
The lake?

06:25.098 --> 06:27.771
You know, it's just as beautiful
as when we used to play there.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.191
- I don't think you'd be so...
- Should we not be afraid?

06:32.271 --> 06:36.243
Should we both not be afraid? We could
be reprimanded for what you've done.

06:36.323 --> 06:37.848
Edward, you're hurting me.

06:38.829 --> 06:40.084
Edward, please!

06:40.164 --> 06:42.319
You know the rules by which
we are governed sister.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.498
Yet you continue to jeopardize us,
so help me to those laws I will appeal.

06:46.578 --> 06:50.138
- Edward, let me go.
- You'll make your apology to them.

06:50.218 --> 06:51.775
- No!
- You will!

06:51.855 --> 06:53.871
Edward, let me go!

06:56.731 --> 06:59.523
- Get up!
- Edward!

07:01.073 --> 07:04.533
Say it! Say it and make us safe again!

07:04.613 --> 07:07.204
I won't beg for their forgiveness!
I've done nothing wrong!

07:07.284 --> 07:10.077
Do it! Say the rules!

07:10.758 --> 07:12.640
I won't.

07:12.897 --> 07:15.957
They're listening.
You know they're listening.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.919
Girl child!

07:20.980 --> 07:25.909
<i># Girl child, boy child, listen well #</i>

07:25.989 --> 07:30.752
<i># Be in bed by midnight's bell #</i>

07:30.832 --> 07:34.862
<i># Never let a stranger through your door #</i>

07:35.643 --> 07:40.263
<i># Never leave each other all alone #</i>

07:41.855 --> 07:46.150
<i># Good sister, good brother, we #</i>

07:46.230 --> 07:50.592
<i># Never forget these cautions three</i>

07:50.672 --> 07:55.067
<i># Long as your blood be ours alone</i>

07:55.147 --> 07:59.568
<i># You'll see us ever from below ##</i>

08:08.090 --> 08:09.612
There...

08:10.626 --> 08:12.517
...are you satisfied?

08:22.135 --> 08:25.193
You and I will never do
what mother and father did.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.662
Sean!

09:07.058 --> 09:10.738
You're home. We thought
you might never be back.

09:45.636 --> 09:49.288
It'll be all right, Kay, no one will hear us.

09:52.149 --> 09:54.799
Yeah, touch it there, yeah.

09:56.491 --> 09:58.582
- Touch it there.
- Would you stop it, Dessie?

09:58.662 --> 10:00.184
I don't like this.

10:00.264 --> 10:02.680
Come on, keep the hand warm.

10:16.831 --> 10:19.022
- What is it?
- Shut up!

10:19.102 --> 10:20.802
Come out then!

10:25.915 --> 10:27.598
Bitch!

10:29.222 --> 10:31.103
I see ya.

10:33.764 --> 10:35.393
The way that they look at me...

10:37.038 --> 10:38.937
...like I have no right to be here.

10:40.946 --> 10:43.204
We understand why you went, son...

10:43.785 --> 10:47.816
...but the others,
they've a war of their own to fight.

10:48.127 --> 10:50.451
I don't see them fighting it.

11:17.351 --> 11:18.933
Sean!

11:19.354 --> 11:22.440
- Kay?
- I didn't know you...

11:23.964 --> 11:28.411
Kay, where have you been? Running around
with those good for nothings in the woods?

11:28.491 --> 11:30.321
No, mam.

11:54.893 --> 11:56.542
Come in if you'd like.

12:06.683 --> 12:08.500
Friends of yours?

12:09.038 --> 12:10.268
No.

12:23.350 --> 12:25.231
The list.

12:30.731 --> 12:34.359
Special day for you today, isn't it,
for you and your brother?

12:34.440 --> 12:36.085
Quickly please.

12:45.495 --> 12:47.485
Who is that?

12:47.565 --> 12:49.620
It's her from up at the big house.

12:53.276 --> 12:54.900
On credit, please.

12:55.781 --> 12:58.306
One more week is all we can manage.

12:58.687 --> 13:00.147
You'll get your money.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.015
Wait.

13:08.607 --> 13:10.155
This as well.

13:11.447 --> 13:13.236
For the estate?

13:13.316 --> 13:15.207
Came a week or so ago.

13:15.287 --> 13:18.774
We have so little post to writing
for the estate I almost forgot.

13:20.064 --> 13:21.912
I'm sure you did.

13:29.181 --> 13:30.612
What can we do for you?

13:34.893 --> 13:37.519
See something in the woods
this morning, did ya?

13:37.599 --> 13:39.582
There was nothing to see.

13:41.339 --> 13:42.929
Hey.

13:43.009 --> 13:45.808
- Leave her be.
- You stay out of this, traitor.

13:46.348 --> 13:49.199
Should you not be out
fighting with the English?

13:52.461 --> 13:54.720
What's the trouble here then, chaps?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.681
Huh?

13:58.707 --> 14:00.423
Brought your friends.

14:01.913 --> 14:03.496
Names.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.371
Hello.

15:00.597 --> 15:02.677
What are you doing in my chimney?

15:07.311 --> 15:09.160
You're safe now.

15:27.519 --> 15:29.049
Hello.

15:30.558 --> 15:33.117
Those men, were they disturbing you?

15:33.197 --> 15:35.823
If I'm disturbed, it's by you, sir.

15:36.904 --> 15:39.161
I only want to see that you're all right.

15:39.844 --> 15:41.834
As you see.

15:41.914 --> 15:43.306
Do I know you?

15:43.387 --> 15:45.108
Sean Nally is my name.

15:45.689 --> 15:48.756
Me mom used to take washing up to your home.

15:50.615 --> 15:53.638
You would've only been a child
when I left for the war.

15:54.772 --> 15:57.265
A grubby face staring through the gate maybe.

15:57.846 --> 16:00.022
We knew better than to stare back.

16:01.887 --> 16:04.699
You won't follow me all the way
home limping like that, will you?

16:07.765 --> 16:09.607
I would if you asked me to.

16:13.142 --> 16:14.533
And if I didn't?

16:15.514 --> 16:17.362
I'd ask if I may.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.195
I have to go, I'm expected.

17:08.686 --> 17:10.367
Mothers love birds.

18:06.604 --> 18:08.091
Bermingham.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.825
What do you see?

19:22.354 --> 19:23.958
Rachel...

19:25.059 --> 19:26.921
...good sister be.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.521
- Edward?
- I was afraid.

19:40.223 --> 19:42.273
What took you so long?

19:46.235 --> 19:48.627
I didn't know that I would come back.

19:48.707 --> 19:50.497
Is that a letter?

19:52.448 --> 19:55.040
It's from Bermingham, the solicitor.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.412
He says there's nothing left in the trust.

19:58.159 --> 20:00.024
He wants us to sell the house.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.784
They'd never allow it.

20:07.311 --> 20:09.200
He says we have no choice.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.091
Now that we're of age, we have the right.

20:11.171 --> 20:13.200
By his laws, maybe...

20:14.257 --> 20:16.139
...not by ours.

20:17.664 --> 20:19.481
He's threatening to visit.

20:21.237 --> 20:23.119
He can't!

20:27.618 --> 20:29.752
You've been to the lake again.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.705
These hours are my own.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.348
Rachel, I...

21:01.619 --> 21:04.771
You won't follow me all the way
home limping like that, will you?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.549
And if I asked you to?

21:11.973 --> 21:13.855
If I asked you to follow me...

21:19.154 --> 21:20.636
...here.

21:21.759 --> 21:23.641
Follow me here.

21:25.901 --> 21:27.592
Who is it?

21:27.672 --> 21:30.163
It's me, of course.

21:30.243 --> 21:31.825
Yes?

21:36.522 --> 21:38.379
That nightgown was mother's.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.175
So was that.

21:52.621 --> 21:54.504
You hurt me today.

21:56.662 --> 21:58.512
I didn't mean to.

22:02.339 --> 22:04.652
Edward, we had such plans for today...

22:06.132 --> 22:09.204
...just to walk in the grounds
and even that, you couldn't do.

22:09.822 --> 22:11.403
I'm sorry.

22:29.461 --> 22:31.745
I remember how she loved those birds.

22:33.504 --> 22:35.326
I think she understood them...

22:35.707 --> 22:37.555
...singing in their cage.

22:39.948 --> 22:43.450
She said as long as she could hear
bird songs, she knew she was still alive.

22:45.827 --> 22:47.706
Maybe she still does.

22:49.935 --> 22:53.397
You know birds can fly
past this world into the next.

22:53.477 --> 22:55.768
We could live a thousand lives
and never know what they know.

22:55.848 --> 22:57.732
Those are just stories, Edward.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.104
She left them to die...

23:04.414 --> 23:06.294
...like us.

23:08.473 --> 23:10.499
They taught us to live by the rules.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.595
This isn't living.

23:14.753 --> 23:19.808
Never leave, never know another soul, lock
yourself in night after night after night?

23:22.166 --> 23:25.495
You know we can't go on like this
any longer than Mother and Father did.

23:25.575 --> 23:28.399
But this place belongs to us and we to it.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.362
There's no other way.

23:32.487 --> 23:34.349
You know I'll die if you leave me.

23:40.871 --> 23:42.700
We could try again tomorrow.

23:44.745 --> 23:46.307
It's too late.

23:46.388 --> 23:48.832
- We're old enough now and...
- Stop!

23:49.622 --> 23:52.683
Why should we be punished for it?
We've done nothing wrong.

23:54.064 --> 23:55.889
No, it isn't what we've done...

23:56.944 --> 24:00.030
- ...it's what we are.
- But who is to blame for that, Edward?

24:00.811 --> 24:03.428
Not you, not me.

24:04.283 --> 24:06.165
It's wrong.

24:07.858 --> 24:10.140
How can fate be wrong?

24:18.412 --> 24:19.993
Edward.

24:21.350 --> 24:23.233
I've drawn a bath.

24:25.193 --> 24:28.010
- For me as well?
- No, Edward.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.717
We're too old for that now.

24:35.781 --> 24:38.397
Bring this thing back to your room
when you're leaving.

27:33.635 --> 27:35.717
And if I asked you to follow me?

27:37.745 --> 27:39.631
Follow me here.

27:46.862 --> 27:48.701
Rachel.

27:49.455 --> 27:52.673
You yearn for consummation!

27:52.753 --> 27:55.725
Leave me alone. It's not yet midnight!

28:03.261 --> 28:04.933
Rachel!

28:18.892 --> 28:20.615
Rachel!

28:20.695 --> 28:21.945
Rachel!

28:22.025 --> 28:24.448
Good sister be.

29:57.189 --> 29:59.004
What is it?

30:13.155 --> 30:14.986
Thank you.

30:20.869 --> 30:22.917
The gift of a pure betrothed.

30:24.945 --> 30:28.100
How can something so cruel
ever come from love?

30:44.518 --> 30:47.935
What's it like out there, really...

30:48.893 --> 30:50.742
...outside the estate?

30:53.167 --> 30:55.793
If I lied and said it was beautiful...

30:57.975 --> 31:00.036
...would it make any difference?

31:04.558 --> 31:06.206
Bermingham!

31:16.382 --> 31:18.538
"Never let a stranger through your door."

31:18.618 --> 31:20.550
Stay here.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.121
Rachel!

31:33.616 --> 31:36.941
Open up. I've come all the way from...

31:38.265 --> 31:39.741
Mr. Bermingham?

31:39.821 --> 31:44.222
Ms. Rachel, I have come all
the way from the mainland, and...

31:44.302 --> 31:48.264
This is our mainland, Mr. Bermingham,
and you seem quite out of place here.

31:48.344 --> 31:51.587
Well, I must insist
that you admit me, regardless.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.815
You know we don't admit
visitors, Mr. Bermingham.

31:53.895 --> 31:56.485
My family has always been
emphatic on that matter.

31:56.728 --> 31:59.655
I'm here on urgent business.

31:59.735 --> 32:01.584
Where is your brother?

32:03.408 --> 32:08.063
Edward is indisposed.
You may deal with me from there.

32:08.953 --> 32:11.729
I am not here on a social call, young lady.

32:11.809 --> 32:15.954
The finances of your estate
are in a state of grave depletion.

32:16.034 --> 32:21.485
The outstanding debt is such that I have
little option but to take drastic measures.

32:21.845 --> 32:24.052
- Wait here, please.
- Young lady...

32:24.132 --> 32:27.028
...I demand to speak with your brother!

32:59.855 --> 33:01.737
Sorry, Mother.

33:17.156 --> 33:18.827
Will this help?

33:19.528 --> 33:21.539
Well, clearly I'm...

33:21.619 --> 33:25.246
...in no position to evaluate but...

33:25.627 --> 33:29.493
...they might help for the time being.

33:35.392 --> 33:39.019
Exquisite, yes!

33:39.099 --> 33:41.390
An exquisite piece but...

33:41.804 --> 33:44.531
...young lady, I'm afraid
you don't understand...

33:44.611 --> 33:47.202
...the magnitude of the debt.

33:47.282 --> 33:52.479
In the absence of your elders,
perhaps your brother might be best...

33:52.559 --> 33:55.426
I was born 11 minutes before
Edward, Mr. Bermingham.

33:56.266 --> 33:58.350
You may consider me the elder.

34:00.042 --> 34:02.090
Walk with me?

34:05.085 --> 34:08.201
Clearly this is an unusual...

34:08.281 --> 34:11.375
...way to conduct business of this nature.

34:12.130 --> 34:14.013
We're an unusual family.

34:14.504 --> 34:15.985
Yes.

34:28.063 --> 34:29.646
Rachel?

34:31.370 --> 34:33.587
Edward.

34:54.783 --> 34:59.270
<i>You won't follow me all the way home
limping like that, will you?</i>

35:00.261 --> 35:02.167
Rachel...

35:02.508 --> 35:03.531
...is it you?

35:03.611 --> 35:06.724
<i>And if I asked you to...</i>

35:06.804 --> 35:09.216
<i>...if I asked you to follow me...</i>

35:25.779 --> 35:28.805
Tell me then, how badly off are we?

35:29.486 --> 35:34.154
I'm afraid the estate could
scarcely be worse off and...

35:34.234 --> 35:38.281
...your family's eccentricities
have been little help to matters.

35:40.449 --> 35:42.868
How long have you worked
for us, Mr. Bermingham?

35:43.549 --> 35:48.603
My family has attended to the needs
of your own for generations.

35:50.194 --> 35:54.256
Never before today have any of you
presumed to come here in person.

35:54.537 --> 35:57.397
The situation has never been so dire.

35:58.177 --> 36:00.393
My brother and I live very simply.

36:00.849 --> 36:05.302
Simply or otherwise, there is
nothing left for you to live upon.

36:09.165 --> 36:12.278
I must see inside the house...

36:12.408 --> 36:14.296
...and bring a qualified individual...

36:14.376 --> 36:17.368
...to make an evaluation
of the property and it's content.

36:17.449 --> 36:19.403
That's out of the question.

36:20.053 --> 36:23.649
The sale of a few trinkets
will only go so far...

36:23.729 --> 36:25.264
...but...

36:25.576 --> 36:29.727
...what about this pretty
little thing? Silver, is it?

36:29.807 --> 36:34.836
If I'm to sell the pearls,
mightn't this be taken also?

36:36.252 --> 36:38.009
No.

36:38.089 --> 36:39.300
Not this.

36:39.381 --> 36:43.262
Soon you might not be
in the position to choose.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.319
If only you knew!

36:49.761 --> 36:53.810
In your position and with your obvious...

36:54.640 --> 36:56.193
...advantages...

36:56.995 --> 37:01.817
...perhaps the best course
of action would be to marry?

37:04.175 --> 37:07.367
This house has belonged to us and
we to it for more than two centuries.

37:07.448 --> 37:11.111
You need not understand that, Mr.
Bermingham, but I ask that you respect it.

37:12.192 --> 37:14.073
Good day.

37:44.356 --> 37:46.012
You!

37:46.092 --> 37:48.386
- What are you doing here? Well?
- I'm sorry...

37:48.466 --> 37:51.282
No, stay there or you'll be
seen from the house.

37:52.472 --> 37:54.182
So you did follow me?

37:55.043 --> 37:58.631
I didn't mean to frighten you, but when
I saw you in the village you looked so...

37:58.711 --> 38:01.621
Come back tomorrow, in the morning.

38:07.068 --> 38:08.949
It's okay.

38:09.974 --> 38:11.847
We belong here...

38:12.969 --> 38:14.543
...together.

38:19.359 --> 38:21.174
Edward, he's gone.

38:27.175 --> 38:28.756
Edward?

39:20.549 --> 39:22.431
Still afraid?

39:23.019 --> 39:24.507
Wouldn't you be?

39:24.587 --> 39:26.615
I didn't break the rules.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.924
Did you dissuade Bermingham?

39:32.004 --> 39:33.886
I tried...

39:34.672 --> 39:36.257
...but he'll be back.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.571
And he came alone?

39:38.851 --> 39:41.367
Yes, he was quite alone.

39:43.494 --> 39:46.352
Don't you feel different lately?

39:49.171 --> 39:52.175
Don't you feel their presence
with more intensity?

39:53.781 --> 39:56.833
- You know I do.
- Do you hear them more now?

39:58.958 --> 40:01.215
In every ticking of the clock...

40:01.295 --> 40:03.271
...and every crick of the floorboards...

40:04.302 --> 40:07.565
...and in every sound the house
makes, I hear them.

40:10.891 --> 40:12.998
They won't wait much longer...

40:14.089 --> 40:16.137
...not now that they're of age.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.580
When they came last night, how did it feel?

40:24.777 --> 40:26.859
Did you call them in?

40:27.282 --> 40:29.097
They wanted me to see you.

40:41.009 --> 40:42.758
I can't save you!

40:47.287 --> 40:49.103
You can't save yourself.

42:04.509 --> 42:06.391
You came.

42:07.716 --> 42:09.565
Don't be afraid.

42:25.618 --> 42:27.499
Have one?

42:35.370 --> 42:37.252
Go on.

42:39.646 --> 42:41.917
They grow so well on the graves.

42:44.522 --> 42:47.144
Come with me, I'll show you where they died.

43:03.628 --> 43:06.912
My brother and I were always
happiest playing here as children.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.188
This is the edge of our world.

43:12.779 --> 43:14.803
Any farther and we weren't safe.

43:16.921 --> 43:18.989
What were you doing here yesterday?

43:19.592 --> 43:21.383
I wanted to see you.

43:21.483 --> 43:23.312
You saw me at the village.

43:25.304 --> 43:27.596
I wanted to see you in private.

43:28.006 --> 43:30.448
You mean you wanted to see where I live.

43:33.454 --> 43:36.012
When I saw you yesterday, you looked afraid.

43:36.092 --> 43:38.417
I was afraid that you'd be afraid of me...

43:38.497 --> 43:40.469
...that you'd think I was like them.

43:42.137 --> 43:45.788
There are greater things to be afraid of
than you or anybody from that village.

43:48.817 --> 43:50.740
Will you sit with me?

44:01.977 --> 44:04.002
This is where Edward found them.

44:04.583 --> 44:06.150
I was in my bed.

44:06.986 --> 44:09.472
I woke up and this was around my neck.

44:11.831 --> 44:13.899
Mother had put it on me while I was sleeping.

44:16.540 --> 44:18.418
That's how I knew they were gone.

44:19.914 --> 44:22.175
By the time I got here, Edward...

44:24.989 --> 44:27.339
...something was broken in him.

44:28.831 --> 44:30.914
He's never left the house since.

44:33.223 --> 44:35.093
Your parents were suicides?

44:36.579 --> 44:40.061
And theirs as well, and theirs before them.

44:41.424 --> 44:43.406
Drowned, all of them.

44:45.532 --> 44:47.581
It's something about the water...

44:49.440 --> 44:52.491
...maybe they think it will wash
their sins away.

44:55.117 --> 44:58.143
"So lovely is the loneliness
of a wild lake...

44:58.724 --> 45:02.252
"...with black rock bound and
the tall pines that towered around."

45:02.833 --> 45:04.589
Do you know it?

45:04.669 --> 45:07.016
I never had much time for poetry.

45:10.414 --> 45:12.739
"But when the night had thrown her paw...

45:12.819 --> 45:15.111
"...upon that spot eyes upon all...

45:15.692 --> 45:18.985
"...and the mystic wind went by
murmuring a melody.

45:20.066 --> 45:21.963
"Then, ah...

45:22.122 --> 45:23.946
"...then I would wake...

45:24.509 --> 45:26.525
"...to the tire of the lone lake.

45:28.418 --> 45:30.646
"Death was in that poisonous wave...

45:32.691 --> 45:34.980
"...and in its Garth, a fitting grave."

45:46.619 --> 45:48.200
Wait.

46:15.611 --> 46:17.494
I'll die if you leave me.

46:19.635 --> 46:21.527
Would you help me?

46:22.207 --> 46:24.387
Would you help me get away from here?

46:24.996 --> 46:27.088
If we went together, we could be safe.

46:27.869 --> 46:29.451
Leave?

46:30.172 --> 46:31.800
Why would you want that?

46:32.611 --> 46:35.705
If you'd seen the world I have,
you'd know you were safer here.

46:36.185 --> 46:37.708
Safer?

46:37.788 --> 46:39.359
All I have here is death.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.118
And what do you think
is out there in the world?

46:42.499 --> 46:46.522
It's a bad place, people are bad,
even there in the village.

46:46.959 --> 46:48.832
I know what that's like...

46:49.813 --> 46:53.441
...to have somebody look in your eyes
and there's nothing there but hate.

46:54.321 --> 46:57.791
- Maybe that's what drove your parents to...
- You think that's what did it?

46:57.871 --> 46:59.719
Hate?

46:59.899 --> 47:02.683
A few squinting eyes, wagging tongues?

47:04.075 --> 47:06.759
There are worse things
in this world than hate.

47:08.450 --> 47:10.333
What's worse than hatred?

47:11.622 --> 47:13.709
Love can be worse than hatred.

47:29.426 --> 47:30.740
<i>Show it to me.</i>

47:33.032 --> 47:35.082
I know you have a false leg.

47:36.305 --> 47:38.120
Show it to me.

47:44.655 --> 47:46.764
Don't, please.

47:47.427 --> 47:50.246
I want to know how it feels
to be somebody else.

48:07.801 --> 48:09.651
Do you feel that?

48:12.979 --> 48:14.828
Do you feel that?

48:16.068 --> 48:18.097
Sometimes I think it's still there.

48:19.959 --> 48:21.711
And then I look at it...

48:23.099 --> 48:25.160
...it's not me when I look.

48:28.042 --> 48:30.058
Does it come away?

48:33.486 --> 48:35.367
Show me.

49:08.322 --> 49:10.416
I didn't think you'd understand.

49:14.167 --> 49:16.216
It's war, you know?

49:18.309 --> 49:20.662
There's a lot worse off than me.

49:24.990 --> 49:27.605
Don't touch me there.

49:27.995 --> 49:30.001
I'm not touching you anywhere.

49:32.437 --> 49:34.329
You know how it feels, don't you?

49:35.110 --> 49:37.958
For something to still
be there when it's gone?

50:05.737 --> 50:10.224
Open up, I demand an explanation for this!

50:13.953 --> 50:17.636
Young lady, I will not be made a fool of!

50:18.696 --> 50:20.978
Oh, Master Edward?

50:22.303 --> 50:24.662
- I mistook you for...
- What do you want?

50:24.742 --> 50:29.029
Well, to be given an explanation
for this chicanery.

50:30.753 --> 50:34.180
I was presented with jewelry
to begin repayment...

50:34.260 --> 50:36.144
...for this estate's considerable debts

50:36.224 --> 50:39.257
...only to find some kind
of substitution has been made...

50:39.337 --> 50:42.187
...at the gate no doubt!

50:43.368 --> 50:45.303
Sly girl indeed.

50:45.384 --> 50:47.206
Mother's love birds.

50:47.687 --> 50:49.771
They've called you back.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.546
I beg your pardon?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.020
I suppose you better come inside.

51:49.144 --> 51:50.725
Wait!

51:52.618 --> 51:54.275
I thought you wanted me to?

51:57.511 --> 51:59.353
I can feel eyes on me.

52:02.737 --> 52:04.108
Rachel...

52:04.188 --> 52:06.331
...there's no one here.

52:06.412 --> 52:08.270
We're never alone.

52:09.251 --> 52:14.139
Young man, this house
is in a state of dereliction.

52:15.162 --> 52:18.056
- We live simply here.
- Simply?

52:19.187 --> 52:21.045
You live in squalor!

52:21.876 --> 52:26.313
It's clear management of this property
is beyond you and your sister.

52:27.754 --> 52:29.645
You'd have us leave?

52:30.476 --> 52:33.327
I see no option, but for you to do so.

52:39.762 --> 52:43.005
<i>Our ancestors fled where they
came from to this place...</i>

52:43.085 --> 52:44.975
<i>...where nobody knew...</i>

52:45.556 --> 52:48.057
<i>...they built this house
to hide their shame, but...</i>

52:48.137 --> 52:50.394
<i>...their shame took form
and it punished them.</i>

52:51.234 --> 52:53.131
They'll never be free of it.

52:54.074 --> 52:55.985
We'll never be free of them.

52:56.446 --> 52:58.260
Free of who?

52:59.100 --> 53:01.542
They live below and we live above.

53:01.622 --> 53:04.448
The day is ours, the night is theirs...

53:04.528 --> 53:08.823
...and as long as we keep to the rules
that's how it remains but...

53:08.903 --> 53:10.918
...now we're of age, and...

53:13.177 --> 53:14.935
...I feel them pressing at us.

53:15.015 --> 53:18.451
Rachel, who lives with you in that house?

53:19.725 --> 53:23.153
Some of these items could surely be sold.

53:24.034 --> 53:27.862
Clean and restored they would fetch a price.

53:28.843 --> 53:31.504
This, for instance, might be a fine piece.

53:32.585 --> 53:36.069
Flemish, perhaps 17th century.

53:42.369 --> 53:46.466
Surely, there are other
properties in the family...

53:46.946 --> 53:48.828
...other holdings?

53:50.620 --> 53:55.264
That ceiling is near eaten through
with damp, young man.

53:58.334 --> 54:00.962
Clearly, this house is beyond you.

54:01.743 --> 54:06.039
A return to England perhaps
might be the soundest idea.

54:07.120 --> 54:09.412
We are not English, Mr. Bermingham.

54:10.493 --> 54:13.790
Not English by birth perhaps, but...

54:13.870 --> 54:17.108
...for all intents and purposes...

54:33.138 --> 54:34.829
There's no name for what we are.

54:47.768 --> 54:51.863
Rachel, what you're telling me,
it's a story to scare children...

54:51.943 --> 54:55.069
...to make them behave. It's no better
than the stories they tell in the village.

54:55.149 --> 54:57.305
And what would you know?

54:57.386 --> 55:01.247
Was it a story that drove my mother
and father into the lake and theirs?

55:01.327 --> 55:05.122
Is it a story that has my brother and I
locked into our bedrooms each night?

55:05.202 --> 55:08.963
It's a punishment.
Our parents followed all the rules...

55:09.043 --> 55:11.770
...taught us to follow them but
in the end, they couldn't bare it.

55:11.850 --> 55:15.375
And when we've fulfilled our purpose
like they did, we'll go the same way.

55:15.456 --> 55:17.881
- Do you think I want to live like this?
- Rachel.

55:17.961 --> 55:21.981
Afraid to live, afraid to touch
anything that lives!

55:22.504 --> 55:24.085
Cursed.

55:29.283 --> 55:30.986
Rachel...

55:31.320 --> 55:33.211
...you make your own fate.

55:33.792 --> 55:35.775
Nobody is cursed to die.

55:38.837 --> 55:40.685
Cursed to die?

55:43.044 --> 55:44.926
Our curse is to live.

55:48.723 --> 55:50.605
Go on then.

55:51.394 --> 55:53.209
You're no use to me.

55:56.238 --> 55:58.087
You're no use to anybody.

56:30.005 --> 56:31.587
No.

56:33.446 --> 56:34.827
No.

56:35.717 --> 56:37.298
No.

56:38.155 --> 56:40.037
Oh, no...

57:20.593 --> 57:22.284
Please.

57:35.135 --> 57:39.230
Never let a stranger through your door.

57:39.310 --> 57:40.789
Forgive me!

57:55.477 --> 57:57.470
Where you off to, traitor?

58:06.263 --> 58:08.864
- Get out of my way.
- Your way?

58:10.739 --> 58:13.958
Got heirs like your friends
up there, have ya? Huh?

58:24.935 --> 58:27.017
What's that, Nally?

58:29.611 --> 58:31.178
Grab him, lads.

58:31.682 --> 58:34.191
Get off! Get off!

58:37.259 --> 58:39.171
Get off me!

58:41.509 --> 58:43.406
Around here...

58:43.486 --> 58:46.903
...we fight our own war, our own ways...

58:47.862 --> 58:49.061
...understand?

58:50.085 --> 58:53.170
And we have no use for you here, cripple.

58:59.137 --> 59:02.989
We have no use for traitors around here.

59:03.446 --> 59:05.326
You get me?

59:05.950 --> 59:08.040
I've killed better men than you!

59:24.820 --> 59:26.636
Let me past.

59:34.372 --> 59:36.255
You've hurt yourself.

59:37.713 --> 59:39.033
It's nothing.

59:39.784 --> 59:41.633
It was the bird.

59:42.255 --> 59:43.904
It scratched me.

59:44.727 --> 59:46.577
You're sick, Edward.

59:47.566 --> 59:49.582
This can't go on.

59:51.073 --> 59:52.982
Who have you been with?

59:54.580 --> 59:57.039
Tomorrow I leave with or without you.

59:57.319 --> 59:59.737
I won't stay and become what they did.

01:00:34.895 --> 01:00:36.778
Edward, I know it's you.

01:00:57.272 --> 01:00:59.154
You won't stop me.

01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:26.818
Never leave each other all alone.

01:01:26.898 --> 01:01:28.721
It's not your time!

01:01:28.801 --> 01:01:30.937
I kept to the rules!

01:01:39.592 --> 01:01:42.379
Good sister be.

01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:45.814
Breed our immortality.

01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:48.320
I kept to the rules!

01:03:29.711 --> 01:03:31.299
They've been in our room.

01:03:31.379 --> 01:03:33.471
You, you brought Bermingham
into the house, didn't you?

01:03:33.551 --> 01:03:36.435
- You made this happen!
- Rachel, I had to do it.

01:03:39.763 --> 01:03:42.956
They don't have to hurt us if we only obey.

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:45.253
There's only the master bedroom now.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.770
Where will you go like that?

01:03:54.266 --> 01:03:56.076
You'll never survive out there.

01:04:11.928 --> 01:04:13.509
Rachel?

01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:16.447
Don't even say her name, Sean.

01:04:18.775 --> 01:04:22.027
See who that is, Mam. I'll tend to him.

01:04:32.537 --> 01:04:36.197
- It's you. What do you want?
- I've come to see your son.

01:04:36.277 --> 01:04:38.768
Come to see the damage you've done, have you?

01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:41.172
- Tell him I'm here, please.
- I know what you're like.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:44.848
- Tell him I'm sorry for what I said.
- I'll tell him nothing from you.

01:04:44.928 --> 01:04:48.858
Washing the filth out of your sheets,
your parents and the ones before them.

01:04:48.938 --> 01:04:50.892
You think I don't know
what goes on in that place?

01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:52.562
I need his help.

01:04:52.642 --> 01:04:55.758
There's only one thing you're good for
and don't think he doesn't know it...

01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:59.643
...so why don't you pay your bill and leave
before you cause any more trouble.

01:04:59.723 --> 01:05:02.550
- I have nothing to pay you with.
- Not half, you don't!

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:05.916
More fool of my boy for thinking
he could get it out of you!

01:05:07.138 --> 01:05:10.356
Take this then. It's all that's left of us.

01:05:12.516 --> 01:05:14.131
Don't touch it!

01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:28.560
She'll be back.

01:05:47.887 --> 01:05:49.902
Wait! Please.

01:05:52.027 --> 01:05:53.843
This is yours.

01:06:00.244 --> 01:06:01.959
She told you then?

01:06:03.545 --> 01:06:05.033
Told me what?

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.982
Oh, Sean.

01:06:18.547 --> 01:06:22.275
In my dream, I saw things, things I can't...

01:06:22.355 --> 01:06:24.179
Whatever that girl told you...

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.129
...whatever awful things...

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.415
...it's all true.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.207
Mam?

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:34.735
How could people like us
ever help someone like her?

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:37.552
It's not that I'm not sorry for them.

01:06:37.632 --> 01:06:42.450
I've seen them when I was at the house
with the mending and washing.

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.708
Just two little children...

01:06:44.788 --> 01:06:46.701
...too young to know what they were.

01:06:47.372 --> 01:06:50.468
Do you believe that two people
can do something...

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.633
...so, so unnatural
that it leaves a stain on them...

01:06:55.389 --> 01:06:57.802
...and that the stain
goes on to their children...

01:06:59.161 --> 01:07:01.446
...and to their children's children?

01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:08.104
They were all like us...

01:07:08.839 --> 01:07:10.388
...twins.

01:07:10.719 --> 01:07:12.534
My mother...

01:07:13.294 --> 01:07:15.017
...my father.

01:07:15.662 --> 01:07:17.886
Their mother and father before them...

01:07:18.967 --> 01:07:21.207
...and their mother and father before them...

01:07:22.676 --> 01:07:25.473
...since we came to this place
and shut ourselves away...

01:07:25.883 --> 01:07:27.960
...so nobody would know what we are.

01:07:31.593 --> 01:07:34.488
I thought your brother
might be the one to help me...

01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:37.451
...but no one can.

01:07:56.377 --> 01:07:59.498
Now don't go rushing off again, Kay.

01:08:00.218 --> 01:08:03.703
There's not much of that traitor
left for you to be running back to.

01:08:18.821 --> 01:08:20.551
Get that one!

01:08:43.404 --> 01:08:45.496
You wouldn't dare come in here, you filth!

01:08:46.276 --> 01:08:48.158
You're not worth the bother.

01:08:58.584 --> 01:09:01.648
Let's leave her alone Leo,
she's done nothing.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.310
What can I do?

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.533
What would you have me do?

01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:45.048
Mother.

01:09:45.127 --> 01:09:46.538
Mother!

01:09:49.903 --> 01:09:51.385
Edward?

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.099
No!

01:10:46.816 --> 01:10:48.908
What have they done to you?

01:10:49.589 --> 01:10:51.422
You would have left me here to die.

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.043
But we knew you'd come back...

01:10:55.757 --> 01:10:57.603
...you'll always come back.

01:10:59.977 --> 01:11:01.811
I saw it, Edward...

01:11:02.836 --> 01:11:04.912
...what you saw down by the lake.

01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:07.880
I know you've been so afraid...

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.984
...but Mother wanted us to be free.

01:11:10.064 --> 01:11:12.113
She wanted to be free.

01:11:15.675 --> 01:11:17.692
Edward, there's still a chance for us.

01:11:23.924 --> 01:11:26.150
Edward, are you listening to me?

01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:28.287
We know what you've been doing.

01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:32.262
You found yourself some man,
some peasant down in the village...

01:11:32.342 --> 01:11:35.033
- ...you've made yourself a whore.
- Edward!

01:11:35.614 --> 01:11:38.640
You think just because
you're outside we don't see you.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.448
You think we don't see everything
you do, everything you feel.

01:11:42.528 --> 01:11:46.222
- You can't believe this is meant to be?
- Then why do we feel what you feel...

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.689
...why do we see what you're
thinking before you do?

01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:53.342
This house speaks to us.

01:11:54.552 --> 01:11:56.828
It belongs to us and we to it.

01:11:59.597 --> 01:12:01.833
Even the bird speaks in its voice.

01:12:01.913 --> 01:12:04.986
Enough! There's no bird in that cage!

01:12:08.748 --> 01:12:11.025
You'll see what we see soon.

01:12:12.021 --> 01:12:15.279
You think that we're cursed,
that we're being punished...

01:12:15.359 --> 01:12:17.344
...but what we have is a gift.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.382
You crave it, too.

01:12:21.472 --> 01:12:23.966
We feel your yearning for the consummation...

01:12:25.047 --> 01:12:27.899
...to breed our immortality
in the pit of your body.

01:12:31.376 --> 01:12:33.025
Get away from me.

01:12:34.098 --> 01:12:38.919
<i># Good sister, good brother be ##</i>

01:12:40.445 --> 01:12:42.354
You know they mean for me to claim you.

01:12:44.017 --> 01:12:45.842
I'm already claimed...

01:12:46.564 --> 01:12:48.714
...by that peasant at the lake.

01:12:48.794 --> 01:12:53.189
It's true. I made myself a whore
for him to be free of you.

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:55.113
What have you done?

01:12:56.376 --> 01:12:59.197
You stink of longing for his rotting seed!

01:13:38.661 --> 01:13:41.302
There's nothing left for us to do but die.

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:52.041
You lied!

01:13:52.121 --> 01:13:54.003
You're still pure.

01:14:04.579 --> 01:14:06.828
The gift of a pure betrothal.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.502
Rachel!

01:14:53.109 --> 01:14:54.991
Let me in!

01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:13.462
Where is she?

01:15:13.984 --> 01:15:15.867
Tell her I've come for her.

01:15:16.956 --> 01:15:18.772
Tell her yourself.

01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:34.169
This place...

01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:39.045
Where is she?

01:15:48.486 --> 01:15:50.578
What do you know about this place?

01:15:51.358 --> 01:15:53.207
I know enough.

01:15:57.689 --> 01:15:59.419
Then you know she can't go with you.

01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:10.443
Edward?

01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:16.266
- Edward!
- Midnight is coming.

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:31.752
Now you see.

01:16:39.888 --> 01:16:40.931
Edward!

01:16:50.342 --> 01:16:52.861
- Rachel!
- Edward!

01:17:24.578 --> 01:17:26.160
Sean?

01:17:31.777 --> 01:17:34.006
Edward, Edward!

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.559
What have you done to him?

01:17:45.301 --> 01:17:46.462
Sean!

01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:16.327
They're coming.

01:19:15.935 --> 01:19:18.619
- Rachel!
- Sean!

01:19:24.386 --> 01:19:25.816
Rachel!

01:20:04.197 --> 01:20:06.481
Come on, the door.

01:20:18.694 --> 01:20:20.542
Come on, Rachel.

01:20:28.045 --> 01:20:31.264
Rachel, Rachel, let me. Let me!

01:20:36.729 --> 01:20:38.586
It's a trap.

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:41.312
They will never let us.

01:20:43.876 --> 01:20:45.459
Sean.

01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:55.813
Rachel?

01:21:03.549 --> 01:21:05.130
Rachel?

01:21:08.826 --> 01:21:10.409
Rachel!

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.398
Rachel!

01:22:51.572 --> 01:22:53.114
No!

01:23:00.179 --> 01:23:01.330
Sean!

01:24:47.329 --> 01:24:48.911
Sean.

01:25:37.798 --> 01:25:39.378
Rachel.

01:25:41.846 --> 01:25:43.687
Did they?

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:46.298
He followed me down.

01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:49.499
They took him instead.

01:25:51.792 --> 01:25:53.674
I'm sorry.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.081
I know.

01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:59.276
Then...

01:26:00.476 --> 01:26:02.250
...we can be together?

01:26:03.615 --> 01:26:05.329
No, darling.

01:26:09.762 --> 01:26:12.017
It's too late for that now.

01:26:12.768 --> 01:26:14.781
I came back to say goodbye.

01:26:16.308 --> 01:26:17.636
I'm afraid.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.129
Don't be afraid.

01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:25.504
You'll be free soon.

01:26:27.397 --> 01:26:29.245
We both will.

01:26:47.638 --> 01:26:49.486
I love you.

01:26:59.259 --> 01:27:01.074
And I love you.

01:27:15.241 --> 01:27:17.538
Will Mother and Father be here?

01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:22.251
Yes.

01:27:24.142 --> 01:27:26.356
Mother and Father will come for you...

01:27:27.794 --> 01:27:29.612
...I promise.

01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:25.921
