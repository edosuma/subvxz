00:01.697 --> 00:04.395
[theme music]

00:14.840 --> 00:17.669
Anyplace. The suspect
can leave the body anyplace

00:17.756 --> 00:19.367
and they dump it
on the only state land

00:19.454 --> 00:21.064
within hundred miles of here,
making it ours. Great.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.283
Why is that a bad thing?

00:22.370 --> 00:23.414
Oh, come on.
You saw the body.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.112
- 'It's a coincidence.'
- 'Nah.'

00:25.199 --> 00:28.376
- Jane taught me one thing..
- Hi. What do we got?

00:28.463 --> 00:31.988
The, uh, victim's name is
Emma Plaskett, 19, local girl.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.859
First responder knew her
from high school.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.557
Lives at home
with her parents

00:35.644 --> 00:37.428
has an older brother
and a twin sister, Maya

00:37.515 --> 00:39.039
who went missing
at the same time.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.997
Their car was found abandoned
last night on the roadside

00:41.084 --> 00:42.346
ten miles north of here.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.782
Who's coordinating
the local search?

00:43.869 --> 00:45.001
Sheriff Hardy here is
in charge.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.611
Ed Hardy. Good to meet you.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.700
Lisbon. Patrick Jane.
This is Van Pelt.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.528
Well, we called in
all our people

00:50.615 --> 00:53.009
'our sole priority is finding
the missing twin sister.'

00:55.751 --> 00:57.057
Lisbon.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.972
Look.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.110
- Oh, damn.
- Yeah.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.156
- No, it-it's a coincidence.
- That's what I said.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.506
No. No such thing
as a coincidence, not with him.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.247
What are you all
talking about? Who's him?

01:13.334 --> 01:16.293
Red John. He's a serial killer.
This is his style of cutting.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.209
- Look at the toenails.
- Yeah, I see them.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.906
Painted in her own blood,
just like my wife.

01:20.993 --> 01:23.518
This is Red John, and he wants
to make sure I was on this case.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
It's strange,
I'll give you that

01:25.215 --> 01:26.738
but you're jumping
to conclusions. Okay?

01:26.825 --> 01:27.957
There's no way
we can know for sure..

01:28.044 --> 01:29.176
[airplane whirring]

01:33.049 --> 01:34.181
[Patrick]
'What the hell!'

01:36.879 --> 01:38.228
[Teresa]
'Oh, my God.'

[birds chirping]

02:07.866 --> 02:10.826
Man, this nicotine gum is
like chewing on a tire.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.480
What do we know about
the family?

02:12.567 --> 02:15.613
Old money. Mr. Plaskett's
an architect, mom's a sculptor.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.875
There's been Plasketts
in this county

02:16.962 --> 02:18.399
since before
there was a county

02:18.486 --> 02:20.444
which means something
to people around here.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.707
Been here ten years.
I'm still the new guy.

02:26.058 --> 02:29.061
[Mrs. Plaskett]
'Have you found Maya?
Is she alright?'

02:29.149 --> 02:30.759
Where is she?

02:30.846 --> 02:33.153
We don't know as of yet,
but every effort is being--

02:33.240 --> 02:35.459
- Where is she?
- They don't know where she is.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.505
We have to let them
do their job.

02:37.592 --> 02:40.247
Uh, can we take a look
at your girls' bedrooms?

02:40.334 --> 02:41.726
Yes, of course.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.772
- Thank you.
- Come on, Mrs. Plaskett.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.646
Here it is.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.735
We, uh..

02:50.822 --> 02:52.520
we tried having them sleep
in separate bedrooms

02:52.607 --> 02:54.522
but it never took.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.567
They preferred being together.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.090
In your professional judgment

02:58.178 --> 02:59.266
do you think that Maya
is dead also?

02:59.353 --> 03:00.484
[Patrick]
'Yes.'

03:02.617 --> 03:06.098
We keep an open mind.
We're assuming that she's alive.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.274
'There's always hope.'

03:07.361 --> 03:08.492
[Patrick]
'Not much.'

03:11.060 --> 03:12.192
[Mr. Plaskett]
'I see.'

03:14.194 --> 03:16.152
Well, thank you
for your candor.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.548
Mr. Plaskett?

03:20.635 --> 03:22.767
Perhaps your wife needs you
to be with her right now.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.379
Yes, of course.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.427
Why so cruel?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.386
Statistically,
it's dad that did it.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.649
Well, since when do you care
about statistics?

03:34.736 --> 03:36.520
I just wanted
to raise his pulse a little.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.044
Hold on.
This is a Red John case.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.917
'The cutting style, the painted
toenails, the skywriting..'

03:42.004 --> 03:44.224
'You put it all together,
it's hard to dismiss.'

03:44.311 --> 03:48.663
Yeah, it's Red John, alright,
but someone else is involved.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.839
Else, why would he change
his MO so radically?

03:50.926 --> 03:52.275
Skywriting?

03:52.362 --> 03:53.842
He wanted to make sure
that the CBI

03:53.929 --> 03:55.626
that you,
would be put on this case.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.194
He's obviously trying to
lure you into some kinda trap.

03:58.281 --> 04:01.850
Well, that's part of it,
but why take them from a car

04:01.937 --> 04:03.330
instead of catching them
at home alone

04:03.417 --> 04:04.635
'like he's always done before?'

04:04.722 --> 04:06.420
And why two victims at once?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.509
Twins? Why break pattern?

04:08.596 --> 04:10.250
Well, he's broken pattern
once before.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.034
Yes, because it was personal.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.428
He wanted to punish me.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.430
I don't think these girls
are random targets.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.562
I think there's something
personal behind this.

04:18.649 --> 04:22.523
Red John either knows them
or knows someone close to them.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.963
[instrumental music]

04:29.312 --> 04:31.706
[engine whirring]

04:41.803 --> 04:42.978
Hey.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.981
- CBI.
- Hey.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.244
You the pilot who drew that face
over San Angelo two hours ago?

04:48.331 --> 04:50.986
That was me.
How'd it look? Clean?

04:51.073 --> 04:52.248
Good and round?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.945
Why'd you do that,
draw the face?

04:54.032 --> 04:55.164
I-I got an internet order

04:55.251 --> 04:57.384
from some company
up in San Francisco.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.690
R-Jay Solutions Inc.,
I think they were called.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.431
- R-Jay?
- Yeah.

05:01.518 --> 05:05.261
They paid the full $1,250
up-front by cash transfer.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.480
So what's this about?

05:06.567 --> 05:07.959
Do you have an address
for R-Jay?

05:08.046 --> 05:09.613
Yes, ma'am,
I do, in my office.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.049
Great.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.012
There's a brother?

05:17.099 --> 05:19.275
Yes. He's on his way down.
He lives up in Parkersville.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.755
Boyfriends?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.626
They had boyfriends,
but nobody serious.

05:23.975 --> 05:27.196
Anyone at the moment?

05:27.283 --> 05:30.242
No, nobody right now.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.288
No, it can often be hard
for boys to have a chance.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.551
They're such a strong couple.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.119
But still,
very different characters.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.297
Yes. If you know
them well.

05:41.384 --> 05:46.171
Emma darker, moodier,
the risk-taker.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.566
Maya she's a happier soul,
more cautious

05:49.653 --> 05:51.916
uh, more conservative.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.701
Yes.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.355
How do you know that
about them?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.792
Well, I tell you that, uh,
only so you'll know

05:57.879 --> 06:00.577
that there isn't any point
in lying to us.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.885
Lying? Why would we
lie to you?

06:03.972 --> 06:05.930
Arden, do you always follow
your husband's lead?

06:06.017 --> 06:09.281
Do you never struggle
against his desire to control?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.196
Excuse me?

06:11.283 --> 06:12.328
Just 'cause
you drink too much

06:12.415 --> 06:13.329
doesn't mean you
don't have a say.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.026
I mean, I should think

06:15.113 --> 06:17.812
he's at least half the reason
you drink in the first place.

06:17.899 --> 06:21.206
Yeah? A good man,
but cold, pious.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.860
You know,
possession of that badge

06:22.947 --> 06:25.385
does not excuse you from acting
with normal human decency.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.995
Quiet, Noah.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.518
Just be quiet.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.128
[Arden sighs]

06:30.215 --> 06:32.827
We've been ashamed
to talk about this

06:32.914 --> 06:37.266
'but for a few months,
our girls have been mixed up'

06:37.353 --> 06:40.791
with drugs and the low
sort of people

06:40.878 --> 06:43.359
that come along with that.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.884
Drake, our son,
heard that Emma

06:46.971 --> 06:50.105
was romantically involved
with a dubious character.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.499
She denied it, totally.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.022
So we don't really know
for sure--

06:54.109 --> 06:55.980
Exactly.
We do not know for sure.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.983
Do you know his name?

06:59.070 --> 07:01.421
Mace Guthrie.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.119
I know a Guthrie.
Small-time thief.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.601
[Ed]
Here it is.
It's Guthrie's place.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.908
Nice, isn't it?

07:10.995 --> 07:11.996
You carry a gun?

07:12.083 --> 07:13.607
No, never.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.696
- You hang back a tad, huh?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

Yes. Okay.

Suite 121?

08:28.682 --> 08:30.727
Sure.
Right here

08:32.642 --> 08:36.516
Uh, no, ma'am, uh, a suite is
like a room or an office.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.039
A suite is a box.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.476
You're a small company,
you look big.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.218
Okay, we need
to open box 121

08:43.305 --> 08:45.307
and we need all the information
you have on who rented it.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.744
No problem.
You have a warrant?

08:47.831 --> 08:49.267
Ma'am, this is
a murder investigation.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.617
We can get a warrant,
but that takes time

08:50.704 --> 08:52.183
and time is
of the essence here.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.969
No problem. Go get a warrant.
I'll be here.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.536
Following the law.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.279
You have a wife?

09:01.366 --> 09:02.324
No.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.847
I have a niece.

Thanks. That's okay.

I show you a picture.

murdered this morning

a sexual relationship

No.

- Really?
- No. Never.

a couple times. That's it.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.373
Mace..

11:18.460 --> 11:19.635
I see you care
for both of them

11:19.722 --> 11:22.333
and I can see
that you're lying to me.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.813
That's a bad idea.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.815
I got nothing to do
with this.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.732
Please understand something.

11:33.605 --> 11:37.566
I have a verydeep
personal interest in this case.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.613
I'll do whatever it takes.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.659
I will have you
framed for murder.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.140
I will torture you. I will
kill you myself if I have to

11:46.227 --> 11:47.968
whatever it takes.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.888
Oh, jeez, Lisbon.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.847
Come on. This is on tape.
Control your man there.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.937
Cut him some slack.
Look, he's just playing the guy.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.679
- He doesn't mean it.
- Doesn't he?

12:03.766 --> 12:06.726
You know what Red John does
to him. He can't think straight.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.424
He would do all that he said
and more, if you let him.

12:09.511 --> 12:10.686
I won't let him.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.602
Emma and me had a thing.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.607
[Mace]
She, um, I don't know
what she saw in me

12:18.694 --> 12:20.565
but she liked me, you know?

12:20.652 --> 12:23.003
Both of those girls
had a way about 'em.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.355
They look at you
like they really see you.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.748
[whispering]
Yeah.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.013
So me and Emma had been
hookin' up for about a month

12:33.100 --> 12:34.754
and I get a phone call

12:34.841 --> 12:36.756
from some guy
that I don't know

12:36.843 --> 12:38.409
saying, stay away
from her or else

12:38.496 --> 12:40.585
and he hangs up before
I can tell him to eat it.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.413
Can you describe his voice?

12:42.500 --> 12:46.026
Uh, soft, quiet.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.332
- Did you do what he said?
- 'No, of course not.'

12:49.725 --> 12:52.336
I kept seeing her.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.991
And then I wake up one morning
a couple weeks later

12:55.078 --> 12:58.038
and there's a pig's head
lying next to me.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.822
'I lock and bolt my doors
every night.'

12:59.909 --> 13:02.346
'There's no way
somebody gets in there'

13:02.433 --> 13:03.695
but they did.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.740
'It's mental. Right?'

13:06.437 --> 13:09.484
The thing is, me and Emma
were on the down low.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.095
'Nobody knew.'

13:12.182 --> 13:13.749
'She insisted on that.'

13:14.794 --> 13:16.796
'So how did he know?'

13:16.883 --> 13:19.102
He must have been spying
on her real close.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.371
How did you people know?

13:33.987 --> 13:36.380
[instrumental music]

13:46.477 --> 13:47.652
[knock on door]

13:51.221 --> 13:52.962
- Good morning.
- Morning.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.182
I'm Drake Plaskett.
I'm Maya and Emma's brother.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.400
Agent Lisbon.
This is Jane.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.793
Patrick Jane.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.404
Have you found Maya?

14:00.491 --> 14:02.232
No, ma'am.
But I can assure you

14:02.319 --> 14:04.931
we're continuing the search
with every available resource.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.412
Please come in.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.025
Where have you
been looking for her?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.462
I wouldn't know that,
ma'am.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.682
To clarify, the CBI conducts
the investigative aspects.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.207
Sheriff Hardy is very ably

14:20.294 --> 14:22.600
investigating
the physical search.

14:22.687 --> 14:26.343
And Sheriff Hardy will call us
if he has news, mom.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.432
How can we help you,
Agent Lisbon?

14:28.519 --> 14:31.696
You told us it was Drake
who told you about Guthrie.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.176
Yes.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.786
[Teresa]
'How'd you know about him?'

14:34.874 --> 14:36.571
Uh, about a month ago,
I'd say

14:36.658 --> 14:40.053
I was staying the weekend,
overheard the girls talking

14:40.140 --> 14:44.274
Emma telling Maya that this
Guthrie character was dangerous

14:44.361 --> 14:45.972
and she should be careful.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.409
Naturally, I was very concerned.
I told my parents.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.802
And then we decided
to confront Emma about it.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.327
I see. If you could sit down
with us, Drake,

14:53.414 --> 14:55.329
and give us a statement,
it'd be really helpful.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.461
Of course.
Anything you need.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.863
I'm just gonna go take
another look at the girls' room

15:07.950 --> 15:09.778
- 'If I may.'
- Of course.

15:09.865 --> 15:10.953
[Mr. Plaskett]
'Sure.'

15:12.172 --> 15:14.565
[dramatic music]

15:42.071 --> 15:44.944
[music continues]

16:19.195 --> 16:20.327
Lisbon!

16:22.329 --> 16:23.460
Lisbon!

16:28.335 --> 16:29.989
What?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.165
A camera,
microphone transmitter.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.036
Someone was spying
on our daughters?

16:34.123 --> 16:36.778
- Yeah.
- Who had access to this room?

16:36.865 --> 16:40.086
Nobody. Just us
and Janine, the housekeeper.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.217
Nobody else?

16:41.304 --> 16:43.132
No. Nobody.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.873
Drake, how's your
electronic skills?

16:44.960 --> 16:46.527
You're accusing meof this?

16:46.614 --> 16:47.789
Let's be fair here.
You're the likeliest suspect.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.486
You can see that.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.967
You did say you overheard
an intimate private conversation

16:52.054 --> 16:53.447
between the two of them.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.144
No, they're my little sisters.
I love them.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.276
No one's doubting that.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.060
Where were you
night before last?

16:58.147 --> 17:00.889
- At home, alone--
- 'No, wait.'

17:00.976 --> 17:03.065
Wait. There was a break-in
eight months ago.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.458
That's right.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.981
They broke the kitchen door
to get in.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.854
They took some cash,
some liquor, broke a few vases.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.596
We just assumed it was
teenagers on a spree.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.121
That'd be a good cover.
Did you report it to the police?

17:15.208 --> 17:17.775
Yes, we did,
and the sheriff will confirm it.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.952
[phone ringing]
Excuse me.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.433
[Teresa]
'Hey. Yeah.'

17:23.520 --> 17:25.653
We got the warrant. We're about
to open the mailbox.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.959
Yeah, Jane said he wanted to be
on the line when we opened it.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.179
Okay. One minute.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.314
My niece.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.272
Beautiful, like a movie star

17:36.359 --> 17:38.187
'but well-behaved.'

17:38.274 --> 17:39.884
Yeah, she's attractive.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.582
Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.713
I'm not looking to get married
right now, ma'am.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.324
Thank you, though.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.804
Yeah, I'm still here.
Mm-hmm. You ready, ma'am?

17:47.631 --> 17:49.285
[mouthing]

17:49.372 --> 17:50.765
'Uh, yeah, open up.'

17:53.942 --> 17:56.162
Okay. Uh, it's an envelope.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.602
It's typewritten,
postmarked Hattiesburg

18:01.689 --> 18:02.907
'20th of December'

18:02.994 --> 18:05.258
it's addressed
to Roy Tagliaferro.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.482
"Dear Roy, I found this address
on a business card of yours

18:12.569 --> 18:14.919
"that I discovered
down the back of the sofa.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.399
'"and so I write to you today
in the faint hope'

18:16.486 --> 18:18.967
'that this letter may find you.
If it does.."'

18:19.054 --> 18:20.447
"...and you are reading
this I just want to say

18:20.534 --> 18:22.797
"that I still love you very much

18:22.884 --> 18:24.625
"despite the very cruel way
you treated me

18:24.712 --> 18:27.062
"and I hope you will come back
to me one day.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.501
"With all my heart, Rosalind."

18:34.635 --> 18:36.376
It's him.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.594
I know it.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.119
I know it.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.947
This Roy Tagliaferro
is Red John.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.559
We don't know that.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.910
Well, we know Red John
killed Emma

18:48.997 --> 18:51.347
so we can assume that Red John
hired the skywriter.

18:51.434 --> 18:55.177
The skywriter was given
the order by R-Jay Solutions.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.180
R-jay solutions
is Roy Tagliaferro.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.097
Hence, Roy Tagliaferro
is Red John.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.317
Maybe.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.754
This woman, Rosalind,
has seen Red John.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.713
Lisbon, she..
She knows Red John.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.193
'This is him.'

19:16.329 --> 19:17.982
Are you sure this is
the right Rosalind?

19:18.069 --> 19:20.550
There's only two Rosalinds
in the Hattiesburg phone book.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.683
The other one's 73 and married.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.300
- Rosalind Harker?
- Yes?

19:31.387 --> 19:33.563
We're with the California
Bureau of Investigation.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.826
May we come in?

19:35.913 --> 19:38.307
Would you show me
some ID please?

19:52.495 --> 19:54.018
[Rosalind]
'Roy Tagliaferro?'

19:56.630 --> 19:58.240
What are you investigating?

19:58.327 --> 20:00.416
We're with the homicide
and serious crimes unit.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.985
What can you tell us
about Roy?

20:04.072 --> 20:06.509
Not a thing until you tell me
why you want to know.

20:06.596 --> 20:10.470
We believe he could be a serial
murderer named Red John.

20:10.557 --> 20:11.688
No.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.301
That's absurd.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.041
- 'May we come in?'
- No.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.087
- No, ma'am, we're not leaving.
- You don't know him.

20:19.174 --> 20:22.569
Ma'am? Ms. Harker?

20:22.656 --> 20:25.006
I'm not listening.
I don't hear you.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.008
[Teresa]
'Ma'am?'

20:27.095 --> 20:28.488
'Ms. Harker?'

20:31.839 --> 20:33.754
- Rosalind?
- 'Go away.'

20:33.841 --> 20:35.495
I can't do that.

20:37.758 --> 20:38.976
There is a girl missing.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.414
Her name is Maya. She's 19.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.459
'Her sister has already
been killed by Red John.'

20:43.546 --> 20:47.333
We don't know, but he might have
her captive somewhere.

20:53.295 --> 20:57.473
This man Red John,
killed my wife and child.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.171
That's why I'm here,
Rosalind.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.696
That's why I can't leave.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.267
[sighs]

21:16.536 --> 21:18.538
I'm sorry.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.366
That's terrible.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.561
[dramatic music]

21:44.912 --> 21:47.654
'I'm blind,
but I'm not blind.'

21:49.046 --> 21:51.527
I'm a good judge
of human nature.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.137
I have to be.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.663
'I know Roy very well.'

21:59.274 --> 22:01.581
I know him intimately.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.674
And I'm sure,
as sure as..

22:09.371 --> 22:12.026
...this ground
beneath my feet.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.897
'I know that Roy
is a good man.'

22:19.381 --> 22:21.601
I believe you.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.476
Uh, I'm sorry.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.391
'That's okay.'

22:31.088 --> 22:34.744
We all make mistakes.
God knows.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.967
Maybe this Red John is just
using Roy's identity somehow.

22:42.578 --> 22:46.060
If we could find Roy, maybe he
could help us find Red John.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.631
Roy came to my door one day

22:51.718 --> 22:54.590
when his car had broken down
off the road.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.288
[liquid pours]
He needed to use the telephone.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.290
So I made him some lemonade

22:59.378 --> 23:03.469
and we got talking about
classical music

23:03.556 --> 23:06.820
and..

23:06.907 --> 23:08.865
[chuckles]
...he didn't leave
for two days.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.390
You two were lovers?

23:11.477 --> 23:13.174
Yes.

23:13.261 --> 23:16.395
- That's very brave of you.
- I have to be.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.222
How long were you together?

23:18.309 --> 23:20.921
Roy was in my life for..

23:21.008 --> 23:22.923
...about five months.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.881
He would come and go
as he pleased

23:24.968 --> 23:27.014
said he was doing business
in the area.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.450
What kind of business?

23:28.537 --> 23:29.799
He didn't say.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.323
You didn't ask?
You weren't curious?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.325
No.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.938
I didn't care. I don't live
in your world. I live here.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.505
I was glad when he came

23:39.592 --> 23:41.115
sad when he left.

23:41.202 --> 23:44.597
You said in your letter
that he was cruel to you.

23:46.773 --> 23:49.384
Very cruel.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.691
He left..

23:51.778 --> 23:53.649
...and just
never came back.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.651
Never said goodbye

23:55.738 --> 23:58.088
why he was leaving
or where he was going.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.482
Just vanished.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.441
It's been
nearly six months now.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.052
Can you describe him?

24:05.139 --> 24:07.924
Just under 6 feet tall

24:08.011 --> 24:11.275
not muscular,
but not soft either

24:11.362 --> 24:13.713
'short, straight hair'

24:13.800 --> 24:15.671
'a gentle voice'

24:15.758 --> 24:17.717
'rough, strong hands.'

24:17.804 --> 24:20.284
He smelled of..

24:20.371 --> 24:22.852
...pine and..

24:22.939 --> 24:24.985
...nails and earth.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.335
'And he liked to listen to me
play the piano.'

24:27.422 --> 24:29.163
What was his favorite music?

24:29.250 --> 24:32.993
Bach.
He admired his rigor.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.387
Did anybody see him?
A mailman, a cleaning lady?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.172
No.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.609
I lead
a fairly solitary life.

24:40.696 --> 24:43.569
Did he ever mention any friends,
people from work?

24:43.656 --> 24:44.700
No.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.618
He did bring a friend of his
over once, though..

24:49.705 --> 24:51.315
...for Thanksgiving.

24:51.402 --> 24:52.969
Dumar.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.929
[Lisbon]
'Dumar. Any other name?'

24:56.016 --> 24:58.671
Just Dumar.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.499
Couldn't believe
a blind woman could cook.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.544
Came over especially to see.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.851
'Can you recall
anything else about him?'

25:04.938 --> 25:07.244
He smoked a lot.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.769
He said he was trying to quit,
but he smoked so much

25:09.856 --> 25:13.163
he had to run out to the store
to buy more cigarettes.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.817
[laughs]
When he came back

25:14.904 --> 25:17.820
he had bought
a stuffed toy elephant

25:17.907 --> 25:19.735
as a gift for me.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.913
That was a good day.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.699
Roy came a couple more times
after that

25:26.786 --> 25:28.048
and then that was it.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.964
Gone.

25:31.051 --> 25:34.445
Do you still have it?
The stuffed elephant.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.535
Yes, I do.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.282
First thing in the morning

25:45.369 --> 25:47.458
check on all the convenience
stores in that area.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.982
It was a few months ago,
but it's possible

25:49.069 --> 25:51.332
someone will remember
selling the elephant

25:51.419 --> 25:54.988
and cigarettes together.
ItwasThanksgiving.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.424
- Yes, sir.
- You got it, chief.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.730
And don't lose the elephant.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.210
- She wants it back.
- Alright.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.343
You know, it's ironic
that she was blind.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.519
How is that ironic?

26:04.606 --> 26:06.434
Whatever. It's messed up.

26:06.521 --> 26:09.306
You know, it'd be funny
if it wasn't... not... funny.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.613
I mean..

26:11.700 --> 26:13.267
[Minelli]
'Any luck on this end?'

26:13.354 --> 26:15.486
Nope. There's nobody
named Roy Tagliaferro

26:15.574 --> 26:18.141
anywhere on the database.
It must be an alias.

26:18.228 --> 26:21.318
Try the name in English.
Tagliaferro means "cut iron."

26:21.405 --> 26:23.625
Thank you, sir.
It's a good idea.

26:23.712 --> 26:26.193
Yes, it is.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.543
[playing Bach's
"Prelude In 'C' Major

26:31.764 --> 26:34.593
[music continues]

27:14.415 --> 27:17.070
[song ends]

27:30.431 --> 27:31.998
[beeps]

27:34.522 --> 27:37.133
Boss, I think I found something.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.961
Overnight I set up
and ran a code script

27:39.048 --> 27:42.312
to search the probate court's
realty transaction records.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.966
I got a hit
on the name "cut iron."

27:44.053 --> 27:46.229
Okay, thanks Van Pelt.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.671
- 'Well?'
- We have a good lead.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.934
Eight months ago, around
the time Tagliaferro showed up

27:55.021 --> 27:58.154
an old farm property was
bought, called Sparrow's Peak

27:58.241 --> 28:00.200
and it was bought
by Cut Iron properties.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.331
Let's go.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.290
Wait. There's more.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.031
A company credit card
in the same name was used

28:05.118 --> 28:07.990
to purpose a large truckload
of construction supplies.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.514
Nails, earth, pine.
He's building something.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.734
Slow down. We need to find a
judge and get a search warrant.

28:12.821 --> 28:13.735
Sure thing. Judge Felton
over in Eckerville

28:13.822 --> 28:15.128
will be the quickest, probably.

28:15.215 --> 28:16.825
- We don't have time for that.
- No choice.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.522
Look, no warrant, no case.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.307
We could catch Red John,
and he could walk.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.875
If we catch Red John, he's not
walking anywhere. He's mine.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.225
Don't talk like that. I can't
let you anywhere near this case

28:25.312 --> 28:26.400
if you start talking crazy
like that.

28:26.487 --> 28:27.880
Crazy?

28:27.967 --> 28:29.882
You're crazy if you think
you're gonna stop me.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.884
Red John is mine.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.669
You try to stand in my way,
and you-you will regret it.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.366
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.064
I am just saying that if you
stand in my way you will--

28:38.151 --> 28:40.153
I've had it with you
and your egotistical crap!

28:40.240 --> 28:42.068
This isn't about justice
or the law.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.939
This is about you
and your wounded pride.

28:44.026 --> 28:47.987
I'm done with it.

28:48.074 --> 28:48.988
Eckerville, Judge Felton.
Right?

28:49.075 --> 28:51.860
Yes, ma'am.

28:51.947 --> 28:55.211
If he does anything wrong,
if he jaywalks, shoot him.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.651
[engine turns over]
Wow.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.351
- Steamed up.
- Yeah. Let's go.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.092
Oh, hold on.
I don't know about that.

29:06.179 --> 29:09.138
What if Maya's waiting out there
for someone to help her?

29:09.225 --> 29:12.751
What if she dies while we're
standing here doing nothing?

29:15.405 --> 29:17.320
Alright, let's do it.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.105
Right.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.984
- What's this, store number ten?
- Eleven.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.464
[sighs]

29:31.682 --> 29:33.075
What a waste of time.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.816
It's worth trying.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.647
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have, uh--

29:39.734 --> 29:41.649
- Sorry. No returns.
- Excuse me?

29:41.736 --> 29:43.651
You buy the elephant,
you keep the elephant.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.740
- You sold this elephant?
- Yeah.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.047
Last year.
It was a good item.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.571
Comes in elephants, bears,
rodents, $9.95.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.399
Well, last Thanksgiving,
do you recall a customer

29:52.486 --> 29:54.314
buying this elephant
and some cigarettes?

29:54.401 --> 29:57.665
No. How would I do that?
Am I an elephant?

29:59.623 --> 30:02.104
You can look at the
surveillance tape if you like.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.105
You have the tape
from five months ago?

30:03.192 --> 30:04.628
Yeah.

30:04.715 --> 30:05.760
Yeah, we'd love
to see the tape, yeah.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.588
My son's a big techno-nerd.

30:07.675 --> 30:11.331
We got state-of-the-art
cameras on a 9-month loop.

30:26.128 --> 30:29.218
7654, Sparrow Peak.
This is the place.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.918
Let's go.

30:34.397 --> 30:35.877
Okay.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.636
There we go.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.333
Thanksgiving afternoon.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.422
Alright.
Where's this elephant?

31:03.949 --> 31:05.646
There.

31:07.474 --> 31:08.562
I see it.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.610
That--

31:13.697 --> 31:16.352
'Oh, my God.'

31:16.439 --> 31:19.138
'That's Sheriff Hardy.'

31:19.225 --> 31:21.183
Dumar is Sheriff Hardy?

31:21.270 --> 31:22.402
[door creaks]

32:04.835 --> 32:06.837
[Hardy]
'Jane, look at this.'

32:13.018 --> 32:14.106
[metal clinks]

32:40.697 --> 32:42.786
- Answer the damn phone.
- CBI.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.919
Van Pelt,
where's Jane and Lisbon?

32:45.006 --> 32:48.575
Following up a lead I gave 'em.
Why? What's wrong?

33:01.283 --> 33:03.111
Oh.

33:10.336 --> 33:13.034
[breathing heavily]

33:43.369 --> 33:45.066
Maya!

33:45.153 --> 33:47.242
It's okay, Maya. We're gonna
get you outta here.

33:47.329 --> 33:51.333
She's alive.
[gun cocks]

33:51.420 --> 33:52.856
What are you doing?

33:52.943 --> 33:55.511
You act smart, but really,
you're kinda dumb, huh?

33:55.598 --> 33:57.731
'Don't move an inch.'

33:57.818 --> 33:58.906
I don't understand.

33:58.993 --> 33:59.907
No.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.604
[laughs]

34:01.691 --> 34:03.302
You never really have.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.565
You recall a man by the name
of Orval Tanner?

34:05.652 --> 34:07.741
Yeah.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.351
Red John's accomplice
in his first killing.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.832
He was caught.
Died ten years ago in jail.

34:11.919 --> 34:14.052
That's the man.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.663
I'm his son...
Dumar.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.274
This is the family farm.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.711
He was a good man,
good father.

34:21.798 --> 34:25.019
He wrote me every week until
the day he died, you know?

34:25.106 --> 34:27.761
- Taught me everything I know.
- And Red John?

34:27.848 --> 34:29.502
Friend of my father's.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.417
And a close friend of mine,
I'm proud to say.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.072
He doesn't have friends.
He has tools. He's using you.

34:35.769 --> 34:39.860
Red John...
is not using me.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.256
He gave me Maya.

34:44.343 --> 34:46.519
He gave me the woman
I love.

34:46.606 --> 34:50.566
- The woman I'm gonna marry.
- Love? She's in a cage.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.481
Love's cruel.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.961
At least she's safe.

34:54.048 --> 34:57.573
Not like out there...
with those degenerates.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.405
She'll grow to appreciate
the security I'm giving her.

35:03.492 --> 35:04.928
Isn't that right, honey?
Huh?

35:05.015 --> 35:06.452
[pounds door]

35:06.539 --> 35:09.672
She'll learn to love me...
the way that I love her.

35:09.759 --> 35:12.240
I wouldn't bet on that.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.851
I'm happy for the first time
in my life.

35:14.938 --> 35:17.898
And Red John made that happen,
so don't you go telling me

35:17.985 --> 35:19.639
he's no friend of mine.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.728
And what did you have
to give him in exchange?

35:21.815 --> 35:23.904
He got Emma..

35:23.991 --> 35:26.994
And you,
he wanted you badly.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.039
He lured you in so sweetly.

35:29.127 --> 35:33.043
'You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?'

35:33.131 --> 35:34.523
If only that Rosalind
woman hadn't popped up

35:34.610 --> 35:36.221
and spoiled things.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.962
We were gonna get you here
nice and quiet

35:39.049 --> 35:40.834
so we could take our time.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.401
Now we'll have to find someplace
else to keep you both.

35:42.488 --> 35:45.143
- But that's life.
- Keep us from what?

35:45.230 --> 35:47.667
Oh..

35:47.754 --> 35:50.583
Well, you'll just
have to wait and see.

35:50.670 --> 35:54.282
It's going to be
so... much... fun.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.547
[Lisbon]
'Hardy, put the gun down.'

35:59.766 --> 36:01.420
Put it down slowly.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.291
Crap.

36:03.378 --> 36:06.381
- Listen, he--
- Now!

36:06.468 --> 36:07.730
[exhales sharply]

36:07.817 --> 36:09.079
[gun clatters]

36:09.167 --> 36:11.081
Put your hands
behind your head.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.648
Well, you fooled us, huh?
Bravo.

36:12.735 --> 36:14.128
You never did go
see that judge.

36:14.215 --> 36:15.173
Damn it, Lisbon,
you were supposed to wait

36:15.260 --> 36:17.000
till Red John showed up.

36:17.087 --> 36:19.089
I couldn't take the chance.
Red John's long gone, anyway.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.178
And you faked
the warrant argument--

36:20.265 --> 36:21.440
Turn around, sir.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.050
To lure me
into the open. Slick.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.878
- How did you know it was me?
- Don't move.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.923
Rosalind mentioned
that Dumar was a heavy smoker

36:27.010 --> 36:28.882
who was trying to quit.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.928
And you, you chew on those
nicotine gums all day long.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.669
'And it was you
that staged the break-in'

36:33.756 --> 36:36.498
at the Plaskett house
so you could plant the camera.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.808
[spits]

36:44.202 --> 36:45.899
Bet you think you're
pretty cool right now, huh?

36:45.986 --> 36:50.773
Oh, yeah.
Bingo.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.471
- Tell you what, girly--
- Don't turn around.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.168
You surrender now, and I'll
try to persuade Red John

36:54.255 --> 36:56.736
to kill you quick and clean
instead of slow and nasty.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.304
Turn around and shut up!
[chuckles]

37:08.835 --> 37:10.663
[Lisbon groans]

37:10.750 --> 37:13.535
[siren wailing]

37:22.805 --> 37:24.154
[both grunting]

37:29.812 --> 37:31.031
Boss?

37:37.167 --> 37:38.517
This room's clear.

37:40.040 --> 37:40.997
Clear!

37:41.084 --> 37:42.303
[Jane]
'Rigsby!'

37:42.390 --> 37:43.913
[Lisbon]
'We're down here!'

37:44.000 --> 37:45.828
'There's a hatch
in the floor.'

37:45.915 --> 37:49.528
God.

37:49.615 --> 37:52.182
[Rigsby]
'You guys okay?'

37:52.270 --> 37:53.575
[panting]
We're fine.

37:53.662 --> 37:56.448
We've got Maya.
Call the paramedics.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.765
'It's okay.
Come here.'

38:13.073 --> 38:15.989
You're safe now, Maya.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.905
[sniffles]
Shh..

38:18.992 --> 38:21.473
it's okay.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.126
Shh.

38:44.017 --> 38:46.280
He was here.

38:48.630 --> 38:49.979
He was right here.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.634
We saved a girl's life,
Jane.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.420
We saved her life.
We have Hardy, okay?

38:55.507 --> 38:57.509
He's gonna tell us
what we need to know.

38:57.596 --> 39:00.033
Oh, you think so?

39:00.120 --> 39:03.602
You should've waited.
We agreed on that.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.691
What if Hardy had
killed you right here?

39:05.778 --> 39:07.432
And then he would've led you
straight to Red John.

39:07.519 --> 39:08.998
You'd be dead.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.697
But you would have
Red John.

39:11.784 --> 39:14.352
I don't think you mean
what you say.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.398
I think
you'd choose life.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.008
Well, you think wrong.

39:19.095 --> 39:22.925
No. No, you think wrong.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.840
Can't you see there's people
who care about you

39:24.927 --> 39:26.276
who need you?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.843
You're being selfish
and childish

39:27.930 --> 39:29.671
and I want you to stop it.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.412
I wish that I could,
but, you know

39:31.499 --> 39:33.458
some things
you just can't fix.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.377
You needn't be angry.
It's just the way of the world.

39:46.645 --> 39:49.212
He's gonna talk.
He's gonna give us Red John.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.997
Right. We have Hardy.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.913
Yes.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.218
And we saved a life.

39:55.305 --> 39:56.829
Yes, we did. We..

39:56.916 --> 39:58.744
...we did.
Hurray for us.

Maya, I'm gonna fill out
some paperwork

40:25.248 --> 40:28.513
with the forensics people,
then we'll take you home.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.557
Okay.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.444
Do you need anything?

40:46.531 --> 40:47.662
I'm good. Thank you.
