00:01.092 --> 00:03.880
- Previously on NYPD Blue.
- Andy mentioned dinner.

00:03.945 --> 00:05.674
Yeah. He was talking about that.

00:05.743 --> 00:08.466
He, um, told me that
you've been going to these meetings.

00:08.533 --> 00:10.961
Mm-hmm. They're going
pretty well.

00:11.035 --> 00:14.304
God knows what my dad's gonna say.
He's already on me, like, uh...

00:14.370 --> 00:17.761
I should be getting married,
have kids, a life outside the job.

00:17.835 --> 00:19.694
My family's
that way with me.

00:19.759 --> 00:21.652
- But you gotta find the right person.
- Yeah.

00:21.716 --> 00:25.368
- I took the test.
- How was the result?

00:25.437 --> 00:28.828
I'm pregnant, Andy.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:43.559 --> 00:45.572
- This is eerie, huh?
- Yeah.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.504
This is the same floor
James was on.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.160
- I hopeJames doesn't overdo it today.
- Yeah, first day back.

00:50.230 --> 00:52.954
- Yeah.
- L-I'll tell you, Adrianne, uh, you know...

00:53.021 --> 00:55.995
you visiting him as much as you did
when he was at home- soup and whatnot...

00:56.069 --> 00:58.409
I- I- I think that had a lot to do
with James's speedy recovery.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.711
- You think he got sick of me?
- No, I- I meant as a morale booster.

01:01.777 --> 01:03.987
- Hi. What do we got?
- A guy stopped at a light.

01:04.055 --> 01:07.445
Takes four.22s to the face,
drives himself here and then walks in.

01:07.519 --> 01:10.626
Thanks.

01:12.556 --> 01:15.880
Hi. I'm Detective Lesniak.
This is Detective Medavoy.

01:15.955 --> 01:18.612
And this is a lucky man.
Short of a need for dentures...

01:18.682 --> 01:21.022
Mr. Biaggi should make
a full recovery.

01:21.088 --> 01:23.811
If he could write his answers,
I'd rather he didn't talk.

01:23.878 --> 01:28.591
Paul Biaggi. Uh, do you know
who did this to you, Mr. Biaggi?

01:35.553 --> 01:37.413
Not an enemy in the world."

01:37.478 --> 01:40.004
Do you remember anything
from the attack that might help us?

01:50.725 --> 01:54.214
One bullet lodged in his nasal cavity.
One exited through his right cheek.

01:54.287 --> 01:56.298
And two are actually
embedded in the metalwork.

01:56.370 --> 01:58.032
Well, he- he had braces?

01:58.102 --> 02:00.629
No, his mouth had been wired
to stabilize some mandibular fractures.

02:00.701 --> 02:04.769
- He already had a broken jaw?
- Fortunately for him, as things turned out.

02:04.838 --> 02:07.113
We wired you up last Wednesday,
wasn't it, Mr. Biaggi?

02:07.180 --> 02:09.804
How'd you get the busted jaw?

02:16.481 --> 02:19.139
A man with a-
a rake attacked you?

02:19.208 --> 02:21.067
No.

02:23.122 --> 02:25.516
He got hit with a baseball bat.

02:25.591 --> 02:28.018
Who hit you?

02:30.050 --> 02:34.123
Not an enemy in the world.

03:52.355 --> 03:55.209
- Martinez!
- Hey!

03:55.274 --> 03:57.451
- Welcome back, man.
- Thanks, Bobby.

03:57.519 --> 04:00.012
- How you feeling, man?
- I'm nervous, like a rookie.

04:00.085 --> 04:03.257
- You're not walking like one.
- Hey, look who's back, huh?

04:03.325 --> 04:05.982
Hey, Andy, thanks for
that Terminator tape you sent over.

04:06.051 --> 04:07.999
Believe I'd never seen that?

04:08.073 --> 04:10.631
I figured there's a guy that got shot,
and he repaired himself automatically.

04:10.702 --> 04:12.134
It's giving me
something to aim at.

04:14.134 --> 04:16.474
Hey, I already took one bogus
check from this dude, man.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.515
- The check is good. My bank's around the corner.
- Besides, he owes me 500.

04:19.588 --> 04:23.141
- This number here is a two.
- Ain't that Silky the Pimp"...

04:23.211 --> 04:25.071
- that helped us with that McCabe thing last year?
- Yeah.

04:25.137 --> 04:28.242
- He agreed to what we said. You heard it.
- I agreed to get my money back.

04:28.311 --> 04:31.735
- Mr. Kerbis said he'll make partial payments.
- The rest when I get paid.

04:31.808 --> 04:34.017
I can't give you what I don't have.

04:34.085 --> 04:36.195
Andy, do you remember
those rapes last spring...

04:36.267 --> 04:38.693
where the perp used to ask
to make a phone call to his wife?

04:38.768 --> 04:40.780
Check out this other guy here-
white male...

04:40.853 --> 04:44.210
gold hoop earring,
two-tone backpack.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.559
- I'm gonna check in with the lieutenant.
- Take it easy today.

04:46.627 --> 04:48.967
- I'm gonna check which cheek he wants me to sit on.
- Yeah.

04:49.032 --> 04:51.788
- He bounced a check on me once already.
- Sarge...

04:51.854 --> 04:53.802
what's going on over there?

04:53.876 --> 04:57.266
Simmons is on radio patrol.
Black guy flags him down.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.866
Says the other guy bounced
a check on him last month.

04:59.939 --> 05:02.497
- You want to look at this guy for rape?
- Yeah.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.996
- Let me see if I can contact some of the victims.
- I'll try to get him upstairs.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.978
No way. L-I'm not taking this check.
That's not what we agreed.

05:08.053 --> 05:10.875
- What's going on, Silky?
- Hey, uh, Detective.

05:10.941 --> 05:13.018
- Simone. What's going on here?
- Uh...

05:13.089 --> 05:14.948
I'll tell you, Detective.

05:15.013 --> 05:18.699
Uh, a few weeks ago, I'm having a little
cash flow problem, 'cause I'm out of the life.

05:18.766 --> 05:20.942
So I decide to sell a few
of my personal possessions.

05:21.012 --> 05:23.506
- Mm-hmm.
- So I sold Mr. Kerbis here my video camera.

05:23.578 --> 05:27.131
Mr. Kerbis's check bounced.
He's agreed to make partial restitution.

05:27.201 --> 05:30.340
Well, yeah, I told him I would pay him
the rest within a few days.

05:30.410 --> 05:34.445
So, uh, we're gonna have to keep
Mr. Kerbis here until this check clears, right?

05:34.516 --> 05:36.910
- Right.
- L- I got a job to go to.

05:36.985 --> 05:38.811
- What's your first name?
- Julian.

05:38.877 --> 05:41.732
I'm sorry about that, Julian. Why don't
you come upstairs and wait with me...

05:41.796 --> 05:43.556
until Silky here
cashes your check?

05:43.624 --> 05:45.670
You will call, right, Silky?

05:45.742 --> 05:47.851
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

05:48.821 --> 05:50.713
Come on, Julian.

05:50.777 --> 05:52.954
Hey- Hey, Detective,
I'm- I'm gonna spread the word.

05:53.023 --> 05:54.882
This department goes to bat
for everybody.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.730
I forgot to enter another check.
I wound up overdrawn.

05:58.797 --> 06:00.590
The only perfect guy
I heard about died 2,000 years ago.

06:00.718 --> 06:03.146
So what's the big deal?
Business slow for you people?

06:03.221 --> 06:05.977
- What's your address, Julian?
- 579 West Broadway.

06:06.043 --> 06:08.120
- What do you need that for?
- It's department paperwork.

06:08.192 --> 06:10.402
Every time I deal with somebody now
I gotta account for my time.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.641
- Oh.
- Have a seat right here.

06:13.709 --> 06:17.034
- Can I get you some coffee or something?
- Uh- Uh, can I call my job?

06:17.109 --> 06:18.968
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Donna, good morning.

06:19.034 --> 06:21.659
- Can Mr. Kerbis here use your phone?
- Sure.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.101
Thanks.

06:24.165 --> 06:26.440
- Where do you work?
- Wall Street.

06:26.508 --> 06:28.902
Commodities desk,
Merianthal and Greer.

06:28.977 --> 06:31.766
Oh, high finance, huh?
That stuff's all Greek to me.

06:31.832 --> 06:35.550
It's just trading the rice to buy or sell
a given product at a given price.

06:35.616 --> 06:38.110
- See? You say it and it makes sense.
- Commodities desk.

06:38.183 --> 06:40.578
Is Miss Stern in?

06:40.653 --> 06:43.977
Yeah, it's Julian.
Uh, I'm gonna be late.

06:44.053 --> 06:47.027
L- I'll explain when I get in, okay?

06:47.100 --> 06:49.659
Just have a seat
until we hear from the bank.

06:56.530 --> 06:58.389
You hear anything
from our rape complainants?

06:58.454 --> 07:02.205
She's working it too.
No hit so far.

07:02.272 --> 07:04.765
I got his address.
I'm gonna run him through B.C.I.

07:04.837 --> 07:09.966
Mrs. Taylor, this is Detective Sipowicz
from the 15th Squad.

07:10.034 --> 07:13.271
Would you please give me a call
when you get a chance? Thank you.

07:13.338 --> 07:15.580
The guy who got shot's a regular Mother Teresa.

07:15.647 --> 07:19.398
You know, loves everybody, no enemies,
can't imagine who'd want to hurt him.

07:19.464 --> 07:23.215
Meanwhile, last week someone tried
to brain him with a Louisville Slugger.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.807
- No I.D.'s on that one either?
- No. Uh-huh.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.858
Uniform did a preliminary.
We'll re-canvas where he got shot.

07:27.931 --> 07:30.753
We're gonna see ifhis wife's
got any ideas. She was at her mother's house.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.191
- We'll talk to her this afternoon.
- The guy's in construction.

07:33.256 --> 07:35.881
We'll look into that.
See maybe if he's hooked up.

07:35.951 --> 07:37.865
Go talk to Mike Francis
at O.C.I.D. On the mob angle.

07:37.940 --> 07:40.596
Okay.

07:40.665 --> 07:44.023
Hey, uh, should, uh, we useJames
on some of the phone work?

07:44.098 --> 07:46.109
Okay. Sure.

07:46.182 --> 07:48.872
- It's good to have him back, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

07:48.942 --> 07:53.557
You know, that's the-
the end result of, uh, Adrianne's soup.

07:55.421 --> 07:57.530
- Would you please call me back? Thank you.
- Detective Simone...

07:57.602 --> 07:59.975
- Silky on line three.
- Yeah, Silky.

08:00.039 --> 08:02.149
Yeah.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.777
Uh-huh.

08:07.031 --> 08:09.426
Uh, yeah. All right.
No, I-I'll tell him myself.

08:09.501 --> 08:12.444
Check clear?

08:12.517 --> 08:14.496
Two days, right, for the rest of it?

08:15.628 --> 08:17.542
Okay.

08:17.616 --> 08:19.661
- Don't grab my receiver without asking.
- I'm sorry.

08:20.728 --> 08:22.937
All right?

08:25.635 --> 08:28.097
Listen, Julian...

08:28.170 --> 08:31.373
uh, let me be candid
with you here.

08:31.440 --> 08:35.192
You know, we're working on this
gas station robbery. Well, you fit the description.

08:35.258 --> 08:37.116
Are you kidding me?

08:37.182 --> 08:40.004
Look, my sense of you, and my first impressions
on people are usually right on...

08:40.070 --> 08:42.114
is that you're a decent,
hardworking guy, right?

08:42.186 --> 08:45.193
If you can spare us just another hour,
we can straighten this whole thing out.

08:45.266 --> 08:47.092
- This is crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

08:47.158 --> 08:49.497
You stand in a lineup,
and we won't have to bother you anymore.

08:49.564 --> 08:51.806
Detective Russell?

08:51.873 --> 08:53.568
- A lineup?
- Yeah, Detective Russell.

08:53.637 --> 08:56.327
What happened?

08:58.256 --> 09:00.115
You want to keep me here,
I want a lawyer.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.040
Whoa, whoa, Julian-
Julian, come on now.

09:02.106 --> 09:05.112
Now, I-I'm- I'm asking you this
for your own convenience.

09:05.184 --> 09:07.491
I'm serious. This is probably total
mistaken identity here.

09:07.557 --> 09:09.832
Julian.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.223
Bobby, guy's gotta make a living.
We'll show this to the gas station guy.

09:13.299 --> 09:15.859
We probably won't have
to bother you no more.

09:18.816 --> 09:20.796
- Excuse me.
- Uh, okay, listen...

09:20.869 --> 09:23.296
- uh, can you wait for me?
- I think he's distressed.

09:23.371 --> 09:26.762
- I'll be right there. I'm on my way.
- I like this guy.

09:28.055 --> 09:29.968
- No hits on those calls. I left messages.
- All right.

09:30.042 --> 09:31.957
- I've got a family situation.
- Someone sick?

09:32.032 --> 09:33.891
I'll explain later.
Would you tell the lieutenant?

09:33.956 --> 09:36.833
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.294
Hey, go ahead.
Go to your sister's. See if I care.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.413
- Dad.
- He hit me, Diane.

10:05.485 --> 10:07.662
Because you're stupid!
Because you don't think!

10:07.731 --> 10:09.590
Couple of months,
the dog is gonna be walking you!

10:09.656 --> 10:12.893
- Dad, knock it off!
- He hit her. Two good shots.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.786
- She wants to stay at Aunt Ruthie's.
- Diane.

10:14.852 --> 10:16.798
One second.
Does the, uh, bar owner have a beef?

10:16.873 --> 10:19.050
Yes. His place got emptied
when Dad started chasing her.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.545
- I think some glasses got broken.
- Diane.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.944
Stay with Mom.
Stay with Mom for a minute.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.879
- Divagno?
- Yeah, I called you.

10:26.945 --> 10:29.821
If I can make it right with the bar owner,
can we make the assault go away?

10:29.895 --> 10:32.104
Yeah, I think, uh,
the magic number's $200.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.031
- Okay.
- The guy's, uh, name is Carr.

10:34.096 --> 10:36.886
- Great.
- You know, you oughta get your dad some help.

10:36.952 --> 10:39.259
I'm gonna. Absolutely.

10:39.325 --> 10:43.044
Mr. Carr, I'm, uh, Detective Russell.
I'm their daughter.

10:43.111 --> 10:46.950
I don't care who they're related to. They cleared
my joint and broke some expensive glasses.

10:47.024 --> 10:48.883
How much damage
you figure you sustained?

10:48.948 --> 10:50.807
I don't know.
Several hundred dollars.

10:50.872 --> 10:54.229
- Would, uh, 200 make it right?
- You talking cash here?

10:54.304 --> 10:56.863
Yeah.

10:56.935 --> 10:59.013
And, um,
I'll owe you a favor.

10:59.982 --> 11:02.026
How's that?

11:02.099 --> 11:04.472
- Yeah.
- There you go.

11:04.537 --> 11:08.856
- Yeah, all right.
- Thanks. Yeah, he's all right.

11:08.931 --> 11:10.791
- You got the rest of it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.856 --> 11:12.715
- You want us to stay?
- No. No, thanks. Thanks a lot.

11:12.780 --> 11:15.023
I'll be right there.
Give me a minute.

11:16.117 --> 11:19.123
- I got it. Thanks.
- No problem.

11:19.195 --> 11:22.137
- Dad.
- Look, she pissed me off, so I came down here for a drink.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.517
And she calls the other one,
and they follow me down here.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.821
Like I really wanted their company.
It was a secret invitation.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.096
- I'm not gonna take this anymore.
- Go to Ruthie's!

11:30.165 --> 11:33.019
- Go to Ruthie's!
- Dad...

11:33.085 --> 11:36.835
if you touch Mom again, you're gonna
get locked up, if I have to do it myself.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.486
Diane, she subscribes to magazines...

11:40.557 --> 11:43.149
'cause she thinks
that she's gonna win a million dollars.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.112
Seventy-eight dollars'
worth of subscriptions!

11:45.177 --> 11:47.866
- Did you hear what I said?
- So I slapped her once.

11:47.935 --> 11:50.243
- That's once too many.
- You slapped her twice.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.966
Oh, another county heard from.

11:53.035 --> 11:55.562
Hey, where'd you learn
that keen eyesight, at Radio Barn?

11:55.634 --> 11:57.777
- Shut up, Dad! Dad!
- 5.85 an hour, huh?

11:57.846 --> 12:00.787
I want you to stay at my place
until my shift's over.

12:00.861 --> 12:03.650
Look, don't talk to me like a child.

12:03.716 --> 12:05.859
You're the only one that had
an ounce of common sense.

12:05.929 --> 12:07.788
I want you to stay there.

12:07.854 --> 12:11.210
And if I call and you don't pick up,
I'm gonna send a radio car looking for you.

12:19.690 --> 12:23.276
Take him to my place,
all right? He's okay.

12:23.345 --> 12:25.325
- Come on. I'll drive you home.
- I was worried about him.

12:25.399 --> 12:27.258
- I know.
- That's the reason I called Doug.

12:27.324 --> 12:30.528
- It's okay.
- It takes two to make a disagreement!

12:30.595 --> 12:34.313
- Dad, enough!
- Come on, Dad. I'll take you over there.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.256
You sure you won't lose your position?
They won't replace you with a broom?

12:39.351 --> 12:41.330
Just get in the damn car.

12:49.456 --> 12:53.108
In public?
Did you do it on anybody?

12:53.175 --> 12:57.944
Well, they got some tea down there?
That tea seemed to help.

12:59.431 --> 13:03.948
All right, look, uh,
don't get angry with me, Sylvia.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.194
I'm gonna inquire
should you go home.

13:07.514 --> 13:10.554
I was only asking you, Sylvia.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.763
All right, listen, uh...

13:13.832 --> 13:16.807
I'll talk to you later.
I hope you feel better.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.739
Yeah, bye.

13:18.804 --> 13:21.176
Sylvia's sick at her stomach.

13:21.242 --> 13:25.529
Yeah, huh? The address
that Kerbis gave- that was a mail drop.

13:25.604 --> 13:29.191
Uh, yes, this is Detective Simone
from the 15th Squad.

13:29.261 --> 13:32.651
Miss Williams, if you can please call
at your earliest convenience.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.420
This is in connection
with your case.

13:34.490 --> 13:37.846
Hey, Lesniak, can I talk to you a second?

13:40.264 --> 13:42.658
- You're working that Biaggi case, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.559
We, uh-
We just zeroed on a canvass.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.566
This, uh, ex-con that I helped out
called about a halfhour ago.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.330
- He's got something on that.
- Is he coming in?

13:50.398 --> 13:53.602
The guy's a little hinky. I'll probably
meet him outside. I'll let you know what he's got.

13:53.671 --> 13:55.682
- Okay. Thanks, Andy.
- Yeah.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.091
- The sarge sent this up, Bobby.
- Hey...

14:03.165 --> 14:05.723
I had the F.A.T.N. Operator
run that guy through Motor Vehicles.

14:05.794 --> 14:08.485
- Kerbis?
- Yeah.

14:08.554 --> 14:11.243
The B.C.I. Kicked out
a voided arrest on this guy.

14:11.312 --> 14:14.221
So we're having the cop
who filled out the 61 to come up.

14:20.069 --> 14:22.278
Uh, what's going on
with this family situation?

14:22.346 --> 14:25.769
My dad was doing some
interior decoration on Joe's Bar.

14:25.843 --> 14:28.270
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It was round two...

14:28.344 --> 14:30.071
after he knocked
my mom around at home.

14:32.033 --> 14:34.854
- Is she okay?
- I gotta get him some counseling.

14:34.919 --> 14:37.828
Any charges on the bar?

14:37.903 --> 14:39.532
Uh, that went away.

14:39.603 --> 14:43.890
Detective Sipowicz?
Sarge says there's a Bruce Krieger downstairs.

14:43.965 --> 14:45.824
Yeah, tell him
I'll be right down.

14:45.889 --> 14:48.546
- He says he'll be right down.
- Your situation all right?

14:48.615 --> 14:50.562
Yeah. Thanks, Andy.

15:00.162 --> 15:02.820
Hey, Andy, you sure
you don't mind walkin'?

15:02.889 --> 15:04.999
I still get a little uptight
being in police stations.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.930
No, let's walk.

15:08.502 --> 15:11.411
You know anything
about this guy Paul Biaggi getting shot?

15:11.485 --> 15:13.792
Yeah, it's our case. Why?
You know something?

15:13.860 --> 15:17.063
I know this broad.
Ends up she's the guy's wife.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.235
A couple weeks ago,
she gives me a call.

15:20.306 --> 15:22.165
She says her husband's
in the hospital.

15:22.230 --> 15:25.172
When he gets out,
she wants me to run the guy over.

15:25.246 --> 15:27.323
You know, take him out.

15:27.394 --> 15:31.113
She knows I did some time.
I guess she figures that makes me a killer.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.356
I'm doing okay with
the towing business, Andy.

15:33.424 --> 15:36.979
I told her to get lost.
I even changed my telephone number.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.805
I'll see you in about half an hour, all right?

15:39.872 --> 15:44.137
Then I heard he got shot.
I figured I should talk to you.

15:44.202 --> 15:46.061
Yeah.

15:47.153 --> 15:49.165
You think you could
arrange another meet?

15:50.489 --> 15:53.496
- She's right there.
- Thanks.

15:53.568 --> 15:55.427
- Hey, Dougie.
- Hey.

15:55.492 --> 15:57.799
- How's Dad?
- He'll be okay for a while.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.759
He discovered your cable
gets two different ESPNs, so...

15:59.823 --> 16:02.480
Yeah. Come here.

16:09.157 --> 16:11.913
Dad understands
he's gotta stay at my place tonight?

16:11.980 --> 16:14.921
- He's planning to talk you out of that.
- He's not gonna.

16:14.994 --> 16:18.198
Maybe Mom should go to Aunt Ruthie's for a while.

16:18.267 --> 16:21.372
I should get back to work,
before they replace me with a broom.

16:21.441 --> 16:23.421
Oh, Dougie,
you know how Daddy gets.

16:23.495 --> 16:25.605
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm not excusing him.

16:25.676 --> 16:27.918
L- I'm just saying try not
to let him hurt you.

16:29.461 --> 16:31.670
Di, you're the family success story.

16:31.738 --> 16:35.325
And you're the sweetest guy I've ever met.
You deserve to be happy.

16:36.773 --> 16:38.818
All you need is to start
believing in yourself.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.518
Thanks.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.345
- I'll stay with Mom tonight.
- Okay.

16:51.272 --> 16:53.699
- See you, Di.
- See you, Dougie.

16:56.532 --> 16:58.642
She wanted him run over?

16:58.713 --> 17:02.104
Yeah, it's probably her had him bopped
with the ball bat and shot.

17:02.178 --> 17:05.218
Andy says his tow truck guy's
willing to wear a wire on the wife.

17:05.288 --> 17:08.262
He met with her before in the diner
about a half a block down from their crime scene.

17:08.336 --> 17:10.960
James, you want
to contact Intelligence...

17:11.030 --> 17:12.856
set it up for somebody
to wire this guy?

17:12.923 --> 17:14.968
I'll tell you, I was thinking
I'd call it a day.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.215
Okay. No problem.

17:17.284 --> 17:20.291
- Intelligence sometimes gives you such a runaround.
- Yeah.

17:20.365 --> 17:22.704
You can be half an hour
with those people on the simplest matter.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.683
Yeah. Actually, I'm not
feeling that great.

17:24.758 --> 17:27.098
- Your legs giving you a problem?
- No, I've got total feeling.

17:27.164 --> 17:30.335
No numbness.
I'm just, uh- I'm a little tired, all right?

17:30.403 --> 17:33.225
Greg, why don't you
run James home?

17:33.290 --> 17:36.264
Yeah, sure.
Oh, uh, Adrianne, you want to do that?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.159
Why don't I call TARU
about the wire?

17:39.224 --> 17:42.845
Okay. Sure.
Come on, James. Medavoy's Livery.

17:42.913 --> 17:47.079
Yeah, I hate to fade like this. I remember
how tough Andy was when he got shot.

17:47.147 --> 17:50.089
Where I got shot,
I had a lot more padding.

17:50.162 --> 17:52.534
- Take it easy.
- Good night, James.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.192
Night, Adrianne.
I'm gonna warm up some of that soup.

17:56.898 --> 17:59.205
Hey, guys.

17:59.271 --> 18:01.163
Andy, you know that cop
voided the arrest on Kerbis?

18:01.229 --> 18:03.088
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

18:03.153 --> 18:05.712
The cop says Kerbis rings a doorbell
from this woman's apartment...

18:05.784 --> 18:07.642
says he's got a delivery.

18:07.708 --> 18:10.332
The woman's looking through the peephole.
She gets this really weird vibe.

18:10.402 --> 18:12.513
She tells him, No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I gotta get dressed."

18:12.584 --> 18:15.722
Meanwhile, she's dialing 911.
Kerbis is standing there. He starts getting nervous.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.000
He books from the building.
The cops grab him on the street.

18:18.068 --> 18:21.337
- Nothing to charge him with.
- They roughed him up a little.

18:21.403 --> 18:24.061
They filed a voided arrest form for
our records in case he turned around and sued.

18:24.131 --> 18:26.689
Guy could be live for those rapes.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.101
If one of these women
would call back.

18:32.950 --> 18:34.810
Put the coffee grounds
in the filter...

18:34.875 --> 18:37.117
pour the water in the machine,
and then you push the button.

18:37.185 --> 18:41.385
Do it now, Daddy. Just do a practice run.
Then you won't worry all night.

18:41.452 --> 18:45.716
Okay. Beep me
if it doesn't work. Bye.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.356
Everything he should
be thinking about...

18:52.421 --> 18:54.980
his biggest worry is how
he's gonna get his coffee in the morning.

18:57.328 --> 18:59.373
My dad was that way too.

18:59.445 --> 19:03.250
You break his routine,
he's like a fish flapping on the pier.

19:03.326 --> 19:05.186
You think I should be over there?

19:08.105 --> 19:10.762
Naw, I don't know
the situation, Diane.

19:10.832 --> 19:12.690
I should be.

19:12.756 --> 19:17.076
I sat outside my building 20 minutes and...

19:17.151 --> 19:19.644
It just gets me so crazy
how he is with us.

19:21.449 --> 19:24.172
Hey, you gotta
take care of yourself too.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.734
I take care of myself pretty good.

19:27.864 --> 19:29.723
My brother...

19:29.788 --> 19:32.062
he stops there every day,
before work and after...

19:32.130 --> 19:34.135
and just takes my dad's abuse.

19:46.131 --> 19:47.990
Hi, Daddy.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.363
Did you push the button?

19:50.430 --> 19:52.289
Left side of the machine.

19:53.445 --> 19:56.420
Okay? There you go.

19:56.492 --> 20:00.778
Daddy, I'm gonna check with those referrals
I gave you 10:00 tomorrow morning...

20:00.853 --> 20:02.713
and I want to hear that you called.

20:05.088 --> 20:07.298
Yeah. And then you can go home.

20:08.905 --> 20:12.655
Uh, no, I'm gonna stay here
at my girlfriend's.

20:12.721 --> 20:14.734
She's still worried
about this prowler.

20:17.245 --> 20:19.104
Me too.

20:20.164 --> 20:22.984
Daddy, use this time
to think, all right?

20:24.943 --> 20:26.890
Okay. Good night.

20:36.587 --> 20:41.869
He doesn't abuse me.
I'm- I'm his precious one."

20:41.943 --> 20:44.819
It's like I'm his accomplice while he makes
my mom and my brother miserable.

20:44.894 --> 20:48.065
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:56.825 --> 20:58.739
Make love to me.

20:58.814 --> 21:01.855
Okay? Just make love to me.

21:54.561 --> 21:56.420
- Dust along the wall, will ya?
- Sure.

21:56.485 --> 21:58.695
- Hi.
- Morning, Vince.

21:58.763 --> 22:02.513
Rape-homicide. No forced entry.
Victim's name, Andrea Lavine.

22:02.580 --> 22:05.139
Boyfriend found her-
Michael Barnett. Lives in Queens.

22:05.210 --> 22:07.069
What do we think
of this boyfriend?

22:07.135 --> 22:09.245
Seems pretty torn up.
He's in the bedroom.

22:09.316 --> 22:11.558
- Go get some sleep, Vince.
- Okay. We're outta here.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.571
Okay, let's go.

22:15.796 --> 22:19.481
This is manual strangulation.
See, there's no ligature marks here.

22:19.548 --> 22:22.075
Huh.

22:23.942 --> 22:26.086
Mmm.

22:27.439 --> 22:31.058
She put up some fight.
All her nails are broken.

22:32.122 --> 22:33.981
Well, let's hear
this boyfriend.

22:36.644 --> 22:39.400
I'll, um- I'll start
interviewing the neighbors.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.796
Hey.

22:47.871 --> 22:52.256
Mr. Barnett, I'm Detective Simone.
I know you're upset right now...

22:52.329 --> 22:55.271
but I need to ask you some questions
while your memory's still fresh.

22:55.345 --> 22:58.351
She's dead because of me.

22:58.423 --> 23:01.245
- Why would you say that, Michael?
- Believe me.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.121
When did you last see Andrea alive?

23:05.191 --> 23:08.495
Two days ago. But I talked to her
last night around a quarter to 9:00.

23:08.559 --> 23:11.500
While we were on the phone,
she said there was a delivery guy at the door.

23:11.574 --> 23:14.199
- He was at the door while you were talking to her?
- Yeah.

23:14.268 --> 23:18.370
L- I told her to have him leave the package.
Itjust seemed too late for a delivery.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.292
So I heard her say could he leave it.
He said that he needed her signature.

23:21.357 --> 23:24.977
And he-And he also needed
to use the phone to call his boss.

23:25.047 --> 23:28.152
She said he seemed like he was all right.
But I said, 'No, do not let him in."

23:29.665 --> 23:32.901
And, uh-And I had to get off
'cause I had to get to work.

23:32.968 --> 23:35.528
I told her that I wanted to hear her
tell him to come back tomorrow.

23:35.599 --> 23:38.453
And once I heard that, then-
then I- I had to get off.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.044
- Right. Get off to work.
- Yeah.

23:41.116 --> 23:44.385
But I called her at 4:15 this morning
to wake her up.

23:44.451 --> 23:47.721
- She's a nurse. She does the 6:00 to 2:00s.
- Mm-hmm.

23:47.788 --> 23:50.664
And when I didn't get an answer,
I drove over here.

23:50.738 --> 23:54.260
I'll bet the second she hung up the phone...

23:54.331 --> 23:56.637
she went and opened the door to that guy.

23:56.704 --> 24:00.510
I mean-
I got busy at work. I should've called back.

24:00.586 --> 24:03.112
- Where do you work, Michael?
- I'm a dispatcher.

24:03.184 --> 24:05.678
Fulton's Car Service in Queens.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.794
You got people over there
who can verify where you were?

24:07.866 --> 24:09.758
- Yeah.
- Bobby...

24:10.883 --> 24:13.539
- Come here.
- All right. Hang tight.

24:16.175 --> 24:19.597
- That guy we were looking at for
those rapes yesterday- - Kerbis.

24:19.670 --> 24:22.230
I'm driving home last night. I stopped at
one of the complainants- Connie Williams.

24:22.301 --> 24:24.345
- Yeah. She give up anything?
- She wasn't home.

24:24.417 --> 24:27.972
This here is the same apartment,
same color building, one block over.

24:28.043 --> 24:29.902
Maybe this asshole Kerbis
got squirrelly...

24:29.967 --> 24:32.908
from our roust,
looked to start shuttin' the witnesses up.

24:32.981 --> 24:34.546
He don't recognize
it's the wrong woman?

24:34.618 --> 24:36.630
If he didn't get
a good look last spring.

24:36.703 --> 24:39.677
Or when he sees she's wrong,
his joint's up, he does her anyway.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.473
- We oughta check out that building.
- I'll take Russell.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.683
All right. It's 3-B, 515 Fifth Street.

24:44.754 --> 24:46.613
- Connie Williams.
- Hi, Andy.

24:46.678 --> 24:49.139
We need to get a cop to bring over
that Connie Williams case folder.

24:49.212 --> 24:52.449
- Yeah, I'll meet you over there. I want to look at this cop's 61.
- All right.

24:56.075 --> 24:58.383
I had a bad feeling about this guy,
and I let him walk.

24:58.449 --> 25:01.620
There's nothing you could've done, Bobby.
Hold that, please.

25:01.688 --> 25:03.548
Thank you.

25:14.872 --> 25:17.846
- Who is it?
- Miss Williams, police.

25:19.844 --> 25:22.534
Good morning.
I'm Detective Simone. This is Detective Russell.

25:22.602 --> 25:24.876
I got your message on my machine.
What's developed on my case?

25:24.943 --> 25:27.470
That was in reference to someone
that we had in custody yesterday...

25:27.542 --> 25:29.521
- to see if you can make an I.D.
- Here you go.

25:29.594 --> 25:32.121
- Thank you.
- Is he in custody now?

25:32.193 --> 25:33.757
No. We had to release him.

25:33.829 --> 25:36.518
We'd like to show you some photos,
see if you can make an I.D.

25:36.586 --> 25:38.763
- Can we come in?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

25:39.795 --> 25:41.654
Thank you.

25:48.712 --> 25:51.336
Here, look at these.

25:58.815 --> 26:00.795
Is he the man
you had in custody yesterday?

26:00.869 --> 26:02.728
How do you know
that man, Miss Williams?

26:04.525 --> 26:06.800
He's the man that raped me.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.725
Uh, Miss Williams,
this man knows...

26:08.790 --> 26:10.900
that we suspect him in your attack
and several others.

26:10.971 --> 26:12.831
And we think
that he may be looking for you.

26:12.896 --> 26:16.581
- He's the man you released?
- There was a homicide earlier this morning...

26:16.649 --> 26:18.661
a block over from here.

26:18.734 --> 26:20.593
- It had a number of similarities to your case.
- Oh, my God.

26:20.659 --> 26:23.185
- What we'd like to do is set up here in your apartment.
- Oh, my God.

26:23.258 --> 26:25.335
You mean he was trying to kill me?

26:25.406 --> 26:28.129
It could be coincidence.
But we'd like to stay on the side of caution.

26:28.196 --> 26:31.105
Yeah. Well, we think it would be
a good idea for you to vacate for a few days.

26:31.179 --> 26:34.701
- If we can set up a-
- Do whatever you need to.

26:34.772 --> 26:36.718
Whatever you need to catch him.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.449
Easy. That's-That's gonna be a cop.

26:39.519 --> 26:42.243
It's Detective Sipowicz.

26:43.528 --> 26:45.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:45.452 --> 26:48.493
- She I.D.'d him.
- Yeah. Hi.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.201
Boy, I- I hopeJames
has a better day today.

27:00.272 --> 27:03.345
- I'd worried he'd overdo.
- Yeah.

27:03.415 --> 27:06.969
First day back.
He pu- He pushed too hard.

27:07.039 --> 27:11.206
You should've seen him go for that, uh,
special Lesniak soup last night.

27:11.274 --> 27:14.630
- The minute he walked through the door.
- Greg...

27:14.705 --> 27:18.162
none of us wants James's coming back
to be any harder than it has to, right?

27:18.234 --> 27:21.504
- Yeah.
- And if he's coming back...

27:21.570 --> 27:23.429
and he's trying to get back
into the swing of things...

27:23.494 --> 27:25.506
and then he's disappointed...

27:25.579 --> 27:28.073
that could be a setback,
don't you think?

27:28.146 --> 27:29.906
Yeah.

27:29.973 --> 27:32.280
Greg, James and I are friends.

27:32.347 --> 27:34.622
That's what we're gonna be.
We're not gonna be an item.

27:34.689 --> 27:37.542
And I'd really be grateful
if you could tell him this.

27:37.608 --> 27:39.686
L- I thought you weren't
seeing that doctor anymore.

27:39.757 --> 27:42.063
- That doesn't make any difference.
- Don't you think...

27:42.130 --> 27:44.657
you should tellJames
this yourself?

27:44.729 --> 27:49.278
Uh, M-Marie's and my marriage counselor says
that, uh, expressing unpopular feelings...

27:49.347 --> 27:52.322
i- is the key to successful communication
with your partner.

27:52.395 --> 27:55.719
Does your marriage counselor tell you what
to do when the other person won't listen?

27:55.795 --> 27:59.513
You don't think that something
could develop, huh? Down the road?

27:59.579 --> 28:02.237
Greg, I'm gay.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.312
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- You got me sweatin', Mrs. Biaggi.

28:05.385 --> 28:07.562
- Here we go. She's in.
- Taking out your husband.

28:07.631 --> 28:10.637
And now he gets shot.
I didn't get one dime.

28:10.709 --> 28:13.586
And now I can get jammed up
in some kind of conspiracy thing.

28:13.661 --> 28:15.673
I think I deserve a couple of grand
just for how much I'm sweatin'.

28:15.746 --> 28:17.604
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

28:17.670 --> 28:20.677
How do I know whoever you hired to shoot him,
they don't say I was in on the plan?

28:20.749 --> 28:22.826
I'm an ex-con.
They're gonna come looking for me.

28:22.897 --> 28:26.419
Listen to me.
Nobody is gonna say anything.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.349
I got my boyfriend to do it, okay?

28:28.414 --> 28:31.324
Do you think he's gonna
let anything happen to me?

28:31.399 --> 28:33.957
And besides, my idiot husband
doesn't even want to prosecute.

28:34.028 --> 28:35.920
He thinks it was random violence.

28:35.984 --> 28:38.544
He wants to forgive and forget.

28:38.615 --> 28:42.519
Look, can't you just wait
until he's dead?

28:42.593 --> 28:45.666
I had someone recommended to me,
a professional.

28:45.735 --> 28:48.492
It's very difficult walking around
knowing what I know.

28:48.559 --> 28:51.052
I gotta think about my situation.

28:51.124 --> 28:54.394
What about my situation?
Do you know what it's like living with Pauley?

28:54.460 --> 28:56.734
The man makes me physically ill.

28:56.802 --> 28:59.196
- God, I hate him.
- That marriage is in trouble.

28:59.272 --> 29:01.448
- Excuse me, I gotta leave.
- But you've had several boyfriends.

29:01.517 --> 29:03.693
And now I have a girlfriend.
Is that all right?

29:03.762 --> 29:06.387
Yeah, o-o-of course.
That-That's your prerogative.

29:06.456 --> 29:08.118
Thank you.

29:08.188 --> 29:10.615
L- I just don't know
why you didn't tell James about this.

29:10.690 --> 29:13.031
I shouldn't have to tell
either one of you, should I, Greg?

29:13.096 --> 29:15.785
I mean, no should be enough.

29:15.854 --> 29:18.961
- L- I see. I take your point.
- Can I take your order now?

29:19.030 --> 29:21.424
Yeah. I'll have...

29:25.060 --> 29:28.681
Any information you could provide us with.

29:28.749 --> 29:32.052
Well, if you think of anything
that might be helpful. Okay. Thank you.

29:32.117 --> 29:34.425
Okay. Aiello signed off on the plan.

29:34.491 --> 29:36.185
The woman's already
out of the apartment.

29:36.255 --> 29:38.911
Okay. Why don't you set it up?
Do a 400 to 1200 with Diane?

29:38.980 --> 29:42.119
Okay, so there's nothing in
this guy's pattern shows him using a weapon?

29:42.189 --> 29:45.097
- No. Mm-mmm.
- How's your access?

29:45.171 --> 29:47.446
We're in the bedroom,
three steps away.

29:47.513 --> 29:51.099
- Soon as he lays hands on me, they'll take him.
- Detective Russell?

29:51.169 --> 29:53.859
Dad.

29:53.928 --> 29:57.033
- It's a bad time?
- Excuse me for a second.

30:00.054 --> 30:02.001
- How you doing, guys?
- How you doing?

30:02.075 --> 30:03.355
- Good.
- We'll go in here.

30:03.423 --> 30:05.337
- All right?
- All right.

30:09.197 --> 30:11.056
How'd it go?

30:11.121 --> 30:13.581
They got some lulus at that center,
I want to tell you.

30:13.654 --> 30:16.444
- Some real sick types.
- Are you set up there, Daddy?

30:16.509 --> 30:19.647
- Three times a week.
- Good.

30:19.716 --> 30:21.926
You caught me at a bad time.
We gotta go out on a case.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.170
Diane, I want to
tell you something.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.132
Striking your mom was wrong.

30:26.196 --> 30:28.372
And getting crazy there
atJoe's was wrong.

30:28.442 --> 30:32.412
You're going through with that course, Daddy,
or I'll get the charges reinstated.

30:32.483 --> 30:35.239
I will go through the course.
I will sit with all the lulus...

30:35.305 --> 30:37.897
because my daughter insists on it.

30:39.282 --> 30:42.967
- Okay.
- I'm so proud of you, Diane.

30:43.035 --> 30:45.408
Detective Third Grade Diane Russell.

30:45.473 --> 30:47.135
Solving murders, solving robberies...

30:47.205 --> 30:50.442
and straightening out
her family squabbles.

30:50.509 --> 30:54.194
I've gotta go, Dad.
Maybe I can talk to you later, all right?

30:54.262 --> 30:56.122
- Okay.
- All right.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.041
- Did you talk to your mom yet?
- Yes, she knows you're coming home tonight.

30:59.105 --> 31:02.529
Uh, did you talk to her
about the subscriptions?

31:02.602 --> 31:05.925
I talked to her about ways
for the two of you to get along better.

31:06.001 --> 31:07.861
Good. Good.

31:07.926 --> 31:10.102
Why don't you go?
I'll just pour myself a cup of coffee.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.633
- Take your time.
- A big part of her and me getting along, Diane...

31:12.706 --> 31:14.980
is no new subscriptions.

31:25.825 --> 31:29.181
Hey, Detectives, I can talk now.

31:29.256 --> 31:32.165
- Good.
- Yeah, that's great.

31:32.239 --> 31:35.860
Mr. Biaggi, I think we should talk in private.

31:35.928 --> 31:39.197
No. This-This is my brother.
I changed his diapers.

31:39.263 --> 31:40.990
- Mike Biaggi. How are you?
- Hello.

31:41.060 --> 31:44.516
- How're you doing?
- Mr. Biaggi, um, it appears...

31:44.588 --> 31:47.629
your wife is responsible
for these incidents.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.674
We believe you were shot at
by her boyfriend.

31:50.746 --> 31:53.338
What'd I tell you, Pauley?
I told you she was trouble...

31:53.409 --> 31:55.804
from the first day you said
you were gonna take her hand.

31:55.879 --> 31:57.737
It's impossible.

31:57.803 --> 31:59.663
Can't you just wait until he's dead?

31:59.728 --> 32:02.286
I had someone recommended to me,
a professional.

32:05.021 --> 32:06.880
Do you know what it's like
to live with Pauley?

32:06.945 --> 32:10.018
The man makes me physically ill.
God, I hate him.

32:10.088 --> 32:13.992
You hear that, Pauley?
That's her in reference to you.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.438
- I don't think that's Angela.
- That is Angela!

32:16.504 --> 32:19.062
We're gonna charge her with conspiracy
to commit murder, Mr. Biaggi.

32:19.133 --> 32:22.010
And we want you
as corroborating complainant.

32:22.085 --> 32:25.158
My wife and I, we love each other.

32:25.228 --> 32:28.498
- She doesn't have no boyfriend.
- This boyfriend you're talking about...

32:28.564 --> 32:31.702
- would his name be Sal?
- S-Sal Pentola?

32:31.770 --> 32:34.527
- You know where I can find Sal?
- Pentola Auto Parts, up by Shea Stadium.

32:34.594 --> 32:38.050
This-This is not true! None of this!

32:38.122 --> 32:40.714
You probably took that out of context.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.091
But I ain't corroborating nothing.

32:43.158 --> 32:46.232
You put her in jail,
I'm gonna bail her out.

32:46.301 --> 32:48.728
You post the bail, Pauley, I'll kill you!

32:48.803 --> 32:51.657
She's my wife, Mike. She's my wife.

33:07.182 --> 33:09.522
So you gonna keep it like this?

33:09.588 --> 33:11.928
No, I'm not gonna keep it like this.
I'll take a shower.

33:11.993 --> 33:13.908
It'll go right back to the way it was.

33:13.983 --> 33:15.842
Good.

33:15.907 --> 33:17.919
What? You don't like my hair straight?

33:17.992 --> 33:20.169
- Hey, wait.
- Huh?

33:20.237 --> 33:25.300
I saw this before. They put ink in water,
and this stuff makes it clear again. Look.

33:25.369 --> 33:27.863
Tar, blood and rust are gone in an instant.

33:27.935 --> 33:30.493
You've got to
see it to believe it.

33:30.564 --> 33:33.059
- You can change it.
- You'll become a believer in the amazing...

33:33.132 --> 33:36.105
15th Squad,
a guy in a uniform just entered the building.

33:36.178 --> 33:38.368
15th Squad. 10-4, okay?

33:38.496 --> 33:42.181
We have some
of the worst here. There's a bottle of ink.

33:42.248 --> 33:44.588
I've got that already. There's some iodine.

33:49.562 --> 33:51.454
- Yeah?
- Federal delivery.

33:51.518 --> 33:54.625
L- I got a delivery
for Connie Williams.

33:56.169 --> 33:58.148
- Okay, 3-B.
- Fifteen Special.

33:58.222 --> 34:00.267
- Okay, this is our guy. Everybody take positions.
- 10-4.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.679
- Be careful.
- Mm-hmm.

34:08.518 --> 34:10.378
Federal delivery.

34:12.753 --> 34:14.699
Yeah, can you leave it,
or do I have to sign?

34:14.773 --> 34:16.719
A- Actually, you gotta
sign for it, ma'am.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.668
Okay.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.685
This better be my slippers.

34:22.759 --> 34:25.154
I don't know what's in the package.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.887
- Do you have a pen?
- It's right on top of the clipboard.

34:27.956 --> 34:29.936
I see it.

34:30.009 --> 34:32.053
It looks like
I'm your first delivery, huh?

34:32.125 --> 34:34.465
You don't remember me from last...

34:34.531 --> 34:36.774
Police!

34:36.841 --> 34:40.231
You want to lay hands on somebody?
Lay hands on me! Lay hands on me!

34:40.304 --> 34:42.699
- Come on! Lay hands on me!
- Bobby, take it easy.

34:42.775 --> 34:44.786
You shut up, Kerbis.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.101
This is hard to believe,
but right now I'm the best friend you got.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.027
So you better stay
real close to me.

34:49.092 --> 34:50.952
What did I do?
What did I do?

34:51.018 --> 34:52.909
Do not say,
What did I do?" anymore!

34:55.958 --> 34:59.282
- Bobby.
- Son of a bitch!

35:08.659 --> 35:11.700
- I got nothing to say to you.
- You don't want to cooperate with us? No problem.

35:11.772 --> 35:14.877
We just want to let you know
what that means. Sit down.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.703
- Thanks. But I know what the law is.
- Oh, you know what the law is?

35:17.769 --> 35:20.492
So, then you know that that burglary
and assault, that's a done deal.

35:20.559 --> 35:23.184
That's a felony, Julian.
You're looking at five years, just for that.

35:23.254 --> 35:26.108
I had a reason for being there,
which I'll explain to my lawyer.

35:26.172 --> 35:29.476
That's the burglary and assault
at Connie Williams's apartment today.

35:29.541 --> 35:31.935
This is the Connie Williams
that got raped...

35:32.010 --> 35:33.870
in that same apartment
six months ago.

35:33.935 --> 35:36.877
This is the Connie Williams who is now
coming back into town from Michigan...

35:36.950 --> 35:39.323
rushing back so that
she can I.D. You, Julian.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.909
- That's another 15 years for her rape.
- I didn't rape anybody.

35:42.980 --> 35:47.661
- Then there's the big one, Kerbis. There's the homicide.
- I didn't rape and kill anybody.

35:47.728 --> 35:51.052
I said sit down! What are
these scratches from, huh?

35:51.128 --> 35:53.238
That woman
in that wrong apartment give you those?

35:53.308 --> 35:55.101
Any of this sound familiar, Kerbis?

35:55.169 --> 35:57.564
Federal delivery."
I think I will take that package."

35:57.639 --> 35:59.979
You remember anybody
saying that to you last night?

36:00.044 --> 36:03.697
This is a case of mistaken identity,
just like your gas station robbery.

36:03.765 --> 36:05.624
You know what
the difference here is, Julian?

36:05.690 --> 36:07.735
That woman that you raped
and strangled last night?

36:07.807 --> 36:10.661
The neighbor down the hall-
she saw you go into that apartment.

36:10.726 --> 36:12.453
She saw the whole thing...

36:12.521 --> 36:14.862
How you knocked on the door.
Then the woman wouldn't let you in.

36:14.928 --> 36:16.940
Then you tried to leave.
And then she called you back.

36:17.012 --> 36:20.501
She saw you, Kerbis. And this neighbor,
she's a very happy woman right now.

36:20.573 --> 36:22.617
You know why?
She watched O.J. Every day.

36:22.689 --> 36:25.282
She's been practicing her witness skills.
She's comin' in too.

36:25.353 --> 36:27.813
Let me ask you something, Kerbis.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.258
You're not stupid enough
to think it was an accident...

36:30.324 --> 36:32.697
that we were sitting
on Connie Williams's apartment.

36:32.761 --> 36:35.068
Do you think that we don't know
what you're doing?

36:35.135 --> 36:37.028
You figure we're on to you
for those rapes...

36:37.092 --> 36:39.683
so you are gonna try
to eliminate these victims.

36:39.753 --> 36:43.308
- Starting with Connie Williams.
- Except you go to the wrong damn apartment.

36:43.379 --> 36:46.255
You are one block over.
But you figure, What the hell?

36:46.330 --> 36:49.720
I'm here. I popped a chubby.
I might as well rape and kill this girl too."

36:49.793 --> 36:52.549
And then you go home.
You get a good night's sleep.

36:52.615 --> 36:54.475
And you go back to get Williams.

36:54.541 --> 36:57.996
And lo and behold, your dumb ass
actually finds the right apartment!

36:58.069 --> 37:00.464
Except she's not there!
We're there!

37:00.539 --> 37:03.415
Now, you take a minute, Julian.

37:03.490 --> 37:05.404
Now, you think about
how all this looks.

37:09.808 --> 37:11.668
Uh- Uh, you're wrong about this.

37:11.733 --> 37:14.259
Hey, if there are extenuating
circumstances here- if you hadn't intended...

37:14.331 --> 37:16.793
Listen! What I'm intending
is to talk to a lawyer.

37:16.866 --> 37:18.725
Good.

37:18.790 --> 37:21.546
You ask him if he wants
to take your injection for you.

37:23.088 --> 37:25.460
You got good veins there, Kerbis?

37:25.526 --> 37:28.403
Because when they're strapping
your ass down, trying to tap for a good one...

37:28.477 --> 37:30.937
sometimes they got to poke around
three and four times.

37:31.010 --> 37:34.149
- And you're thinking to yourself,
Is that it? Is that it?"

37:44.963 --> 37:47.303
What do I have to do
to take execution off the table?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.776
You give us a statement,
and I really like your chances.

38:04.979 --> 38:07.285
Burnin', uh, the midnight oil, huh, James?

38:07.352 --> 38:11.070
Yeah. I got all involved with
the monthly statistics here.

38:11.137 --> 38:14.439
How can we be down
22% in robberies and up 11 in burglaries?

38:14.506 --> 38:16.649
Yeah, I don't know.

38:16.718 --> 38:19.856
I hear you made a collar.
The, uh, guy with the bullets in his teeth?

38:19.925 --> 38:22.168
Yeah, it was the wife.

38:22.235 --> 38:25.209
Yeah. She used her boyfriend
to try to whack him.

38:25.282 --> 38:27.327
I don't know how far it's gonna
go through the system.

38:27.399 --> 38:29.641
Uh, the husband
don't want to cooperate.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.235
- Yeah, we catch 'em. We don't cook 'em. Right, Greg?
- Yeah.

38:33.557 --> 38:35.504
Um...

38:35.578 --> 38:37.885
Listen, uh, I had occasion...

38:37.953 --> 38:40.161
to, uh, speak with Adrianne...

38:40.230 --> 38:42.274
on the subject of the two of you.

38:42.346 --> 38:43.877
Is that right?

38:43.950 --> 38:48.083
Adrianne wants to be your friend, James...

38:48.151 --> 38:51.323
which she feels
she's failed to convey.

38:51.391 --> 38:55.263
- My friend?
- You know what that means when a girl says that?

38:55.337 --> 38:58.125
Yeah. I mean,
if you go to dinner, you go dutch.

39:00.019 --> 39:03.126
- She told you to tell me this?
- Hey...

39:03.195 --> 39:05.622
a guy your age, your charisma...

39:05.697 --> 39:08.738
I- I-I'd pay a month's salary
to have your prospects...

39:08.808 --> 39:11.432
th-the minute
your availability is known.

39:11.502 --> 39:14.291
Geez, I thought she was
warming up towards me.

39:16.731 --> 39:18.776
Um...

39:18.848 --> 39:21.921
Adrianne has made a change, James...

39:21.991 --> 39:25.098
in- in- in- in terms of her preferences.

39:25.167 --> 39:28.305
Yeah, away from me.

39:28.374 --> 39:30.419
And towards women.

39:30.491 --> 39:33.760
- Get outta here!
- Which is absolutely her prerogative, you know?

39:33.827 --> 39:37.316
- But I gotta say, I-I'm shocked.
- She told you this straight out?

39:37.388 --> 39:41.138
- Right in the surveillance van.
- Wow.

39:41.204 --> 39:44.923
- Why didn't she tell me?
- Sh-She more or less blurted it out.

39:44.989 --> 39:46.848
And I- I- I- I think
her position on it was, uh...

39:46.913 --> 39:49.506
she felt she shouldn't
have to tell anybody.

39:49.576 --> 39:53.514
But, uh, you know, sh-she was-
she was getting exasperated, uh...

39:53.586 --> 39:56.210
because her- her no"
wasn't being heard.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.139
Wow.

40:00.546 --> 40:02.820
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:04.138 --> 40:06.031
- Good night, Adrianne.
- Good night, James.

40:06.095 --> 40:08.172
Hey, I, uh- I talked to Greg.

40:08.244 --> 40:11.635
He relayed your message to me.
You're gay now, huh?

40:13.023 --> 40:15.712
I just always liked you
as a friend, James.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.674
Yeah. Well, I-
I hope you're happy.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.456
I hope you are too.

40:21.523 --> 40:24.465
Is, uh, she someone I know?

40:27.040 --> 40:29.567
- Good night, James.
- Yeah, good night.

40:41.218 --> 40:44.520
That was good coffee.
And good brownies, Dot.

40:44.585 --> 40:48.905
He went to that course.
Hope it'll help him.

40:50.006 --> 40:53.692
Mom, you have to
think about yourself too.

40:53.759 --> 40:56.963
If you feel like you should go
to Aunt Ruthie's, then you absolutely should.

40:57.031 --> 40:59.589
I'm hoping this'll help.

41:01.488 --> 41:05.010
I told them at the course, uh,
we're gonna be married 36 years.

41:05.081 --> 41:07.990
Yeah. Thirty-six years April.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.657
Yeah. Must be doing something right.

41:12.073 --> 41:14.764
Look at those bottles.

41:14.833 --> 41:17.873
She leaves 'em over here
by the door so that she don't forget.

41:17.944 --> 41:21.728
Hauls 40 of'em down there
to a machine, pays her a buck.

41:21.793 --> 41:24.035
- It's for the ecology too.
- I think that's good.

41:24.102 --> 41:26.344
Hey, I'm saying I think it's great.

41:27.407 --> 41:30.709
Huh? There he is,
'The Boom Box Mogul."

41:30.773 --> 41:33.530
- Hey, Dougie.
- Hey, Di.

41:33.596 --> 41:36.253
- I made brownies, Dougie.
- Yeah.

41:36.323 --> 41:38.183
Why don't you go in
and, uh, have a brownie...

41:38.248 --> 41:42.151
and then come out here and tell us what
you know about the world of answering machines?

41:42.224 --> 41:46.063
Dottie, you got
my beer bottles in there.

41:46.138 --> 41:48.478
It's better than just
throwing 'em away.

41:48.544 --> 41:50.435
The machine doesn't
take beer bottles.

41:50.501 --> 41:52.775
So she hauls them
down there for nothing.

41:52.841 --> 41:55.499
The homeless people take 'em
to another recycling place.

41:55.569 --> 41:58.390
The homeless people
are thieves and junkies.

41:58.455 --> 42:02.426
If they don't turn those bottles in for drug money,
they use 'em for weapons.

42:02.497 --> 42:05.986
Isn't that right, Diane?
Are not most of the homeless people criminals?

42:06.058 --> 42:09.677
Daddy, why don't you just let Mom
take the bottles where she wants?

42:09.746 --> 42:12.502
Yeah, you're right.
She can do anything she wants.

42:12.569 --> 42:16.636
Hey, take all the bottles down there.
Get your 50 cents.

42:16.705 --> 42:19.713
Hey, I know.

42:19.785 --> 42:22.791
Why don't you take the homeless
all these friggin' magazines...

42:22.864 --> 42:25.041
you subscribe to,
and maybe they can read 'em?

42:25.110 --> 42:27.766
- Dad!
- Gourmet magazine. Oh, yeah.

42:27.835 --> 42:30.843
- Dorothy Russell, gourmet chef.
- Daddy, shut up!

42:30.916 --> 42:33.540
He's just tryin' to make a joke.

42:33.609 --> 42:37.098
Yeah, God made a joke.

42:37.170 --> 42:40.024
Made a couple of'em.

42:40.089 --> 42:42.616
I have to go. I gotta go now.

42:50.065 --> 42:51.923
What did I say?

43:16.911 --> 43:18.770
Hi.

43:18.835 --> 43:20.694
What's going on?

43:20.760 --> 43:23.221
Oh.

43:23.294 --> 43:25.208
I've had two beers.

43:25.283 --> 43:27.143
I'm about to go to boilermakers.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.720
And I want to stop.

43:39.364 --> 43:41.223
Let's get out of here then.

43:42.347 --> 43:45.201
- You straight with this bartender?
- Yeah.

43:45.267 --> 43:47.180
Come on.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.002
Should you, uh, call Andy?

43:58.642 --> 44:00.501
I called who I wanted to call.
