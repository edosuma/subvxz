is very hot."

00:16.117 --> 00:21.053

00:23.557 --> 00:26.458
- Last week, I finally became
permanent manager

00:26.460 --> 00:28.327
Of dunder mifflin scranton!

00:28.329 --> 00:30.562
My first project:
Increase security.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.631
I got these doors
from a jewelry store

00:32.633 --> 00:34.166
That had recently
gone out of business.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.334
Now they're protecting

00:35.336 --> 00:37.436
America's <i>real</i> treasure--
paper!

00:37.438 --> 00:40.506
Every morning, I email
the day's security codes.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.574
Something that's been
really missing from my life

00:42.576 --> 00:44.410
Has been writing
secret codes.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.646
It's not the kgb,
but it's a start.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.282
[buzzer]

00:50.284 --> 00:52.818
- "the tea in nepal
is very hot."

00:52.820 --> 00:54.753
- "but the coffee in peru
is far hotter."

00:54.755 --> 00:57.489
- Close.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.724
- This is Tuesday, right?

00:58.726 --> 01:02.127
The--the coffee
in paraguay is far hotter?

01:02.129 --> 01:04.730
- "the coffee in paraguay
is <i>colder?"</i>

01:04.732 --> 01:06.465
- No, I meant
you were getting colder.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.100
The correct response is,

01:08.102 --> 01:10.669
"the coffee in peru
is   <i>muc</i>hotter."

01:10.671 --> 01:12.304
- Oh, <i>much.</i> Okay.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.473
So I gotta give you
the steam.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.642
- Unless you want me
to break protocol.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.551
- No, no.
Give me the steam.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.619
[hangs up phone receiver]

01:29.122 --> 01:30.789
[steam whooshes]

01:30.791 --> 01:33.358
It's just harmless steam
to panic intruders.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.262
I'd like to get harmful steam,
but the prices are absurd!

01:37.264 --> 01:42.367
Break protocol!
Break protocol! Break protocol!

01:42.369 --> 01:45.237
- Oh, I'm saving a fortune
on dry-cleaning.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.240
[cheerful music]

01:48.242 --> 01:56.315
â™ª

02:17.670 --> 02:18.670
- Mama.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.240
- Angela,
someone wants you.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.441
- Okay. Coming.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.811
[baby crying]

02:25.813 --> 02:27.279
Hi, baby.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.680
- Angela's divorce
from the senator

02:28.682 --> 02:31.183
Has been very difficult
for her.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.285
When she got kicked out
of her apartment,

02:33.287 --> 02:35.521
I invited her
to move in with me.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.790
Ironic that now it's angela
who's living in the closet.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.460
Hey-o.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.328
Saddle shoes with denim?

02:43.330 --> 02:47.666
I will literally call
child protective services.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.440
- Go get 'em, honey.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.709
- Oh, don't worry.
They'll get got.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.944
[laughs]

02:58.946 --> 03:00.612
Manager of dunder mifflin.
Check!

03:00.614 --> 03:03.415
Owner of
a 1,600-acre beet farm. Check!

03:03.417 --> 03:06.351
Engaged to be married to
an actual milkmaid.

03:06.353 --> 03:10.322
Check...On that
later today.

03:10.324 --> 03:14.326
This is
my grandmother's ring.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.728
It was made from a bullet
I took out of her left buttock.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.264
She was a moonshiner
shot by adolph coors.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.568
This is my grandmother's
buttock bullet ring.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.369
[background chatter]

03:24.371 --> 03:25.470
- Hi. Good morning.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.573
Name is andrew bernard.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.309
You might know me
from a tv documentary

03:30.311 --> 03:32.377
That's premiering tonight.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.213
Also killed it
in local theater,

03:34.215 --> 03:38.383
And I am fresh off of
a hot industrial flick.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.718
- Okay. Thanks.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.919
Go ahead and get
in the back of the line.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.355
- Yes!

03:43.357 --> 03:48.560
[overlapping chatter]

03:48.562 --> 03:51.263
Well, I burned all my bridges
at dunder mifflin,

03:51.265 --> 03:53.799
And time to become
the next american idol

03:53.801 --> 03:57.002
By winning <i>america's next</i>
<i>a cappella sensation</i>

03:57.004 --> 03:59.404
On channel tbd.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.706
It's a really cool show.

04:00.708 --> 04:05.811
Of the whole <i>american</i>
<i>idol/voice/sing-off</i> phenomenon.

04:05.813 --> 04:09.281
On this show,
all three judges are mean.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.949
[overlapping chatter]

04:10.951 --> 04:13.285
- Sales form
for you to sign.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.386
- You know what to do.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.700
- Okay.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.637
Is a great assistant
to the regional manager,

04:31.639 --> 04:33.005
And I have chosen
one of the best.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.539
- Aw, thanks, man.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.275
- Once upon a time,
we were natural enemies,

04:36.277 --> 04:37.776
But we've overcome
our differences,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.278
Much like germany and Italy
in world war--

04:39.280 --> 04:40.812
- No.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.547
- Good call.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.350
Together, we run
a no-nonsense office.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.297
- Pre-conference room meeting
with dwight went really well.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.365
- Oh. Bodes well for the
post-conference room meeting.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.300
- All depends on the conference
room meeting itself.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.035
[musical ringtone]

05:03.970 --> 05:06.071
Uh, okay.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.339
- Is that them again?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.507
- Yeah.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.375
- Maybe you should
call back.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.345
- I will.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.681
I will.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.482
The guys at athlead
are still bugging me

05:17.484 --> 05:19.751
About this three-month
road show thing.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.386
Meeting athletes
on their home turf,

05:21.388 --> 05:22.754
Building relationships.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.356
Yeah, it sounds exciting.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.626
But I said no,
and that's final.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.795
I almost lost pam
over this business.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.698
I'm not risking that again.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.666
- When jim decided to come back
to scranton full-time,

05:34.668 --> 05:39.338
I was relieved, but I also
feel a little guilty.

05:39.340 --> 05:43.041
I mean, he's giving up
this big thing for me.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.876
But he seems happy.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.679
I mean, he's certainly been
goofing around a lot.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.681
I love goofy jim.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.682
- Welcome.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.717
- He welcomes you.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.385
- Please take
an agenda item.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.586
- Your agenda-taking
pleases him.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.854
- Have a seat, phyllis.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.089
There we go.

05:57.091 --> 05:58.890
As you know,
I like to begin each day

05:58.892 --> 06:00.425
With an inspirational quote.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.861
"some say the only failure
there is

06:02.863 --> 06:04.930
Is the failure to try."

06:04.932 --> 06:06.732
[imitates buzzer]
"that is wrong.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.034
Failure of any kind
is failure."

06:09.036 --> 06:10.035
Jim, over to you.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.503
- Let's not get crazy

06:11.505 --> 06:14.072
And ruin our no-nonsense streak,
all right?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.108
So, for instance, if you're
expecting a fax today,

06:16.110 --> 06:17.476
Please don't yell out,

06:17.478 --> 06:20.379
"michael j. Fax
from fax to the future!"

06:20.381 --> 06:22.481
Okay? That's nonsense.
- Question.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.882
- Yes, beautiful girl
in the front.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.552
- We are expecting a water
delivery today at 10 a.M.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.755
What if, as they're
delivering the water jugs,

06:29.757 --> 06:31.890
Someone screams out,
"nice jugs!"

06:31.892 --> 06:34.726
- That's obviously nonsense.
Nonsense.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.129
And what percentage
of nonsense

06:37.131 --> 06:38.797
Do we tolerate
in this office?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.599
- Zero.
- No nonsense.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.000
- No. Can't have nonsense.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.402
- What is going on?

06:43.404 --> 06:44.803
- Daycare won't take phillip
anymore.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.104
- Why?
- [sighs]

06:46.106 --> 06:47.739
Apparently my station
in life

06:47.741 --> 06:50.909
Has descended to a depth
even they won't forgive.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.144
So, hi.

06:52.146 --> 06:53.845
- Hi, buddy.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.913
- Okay.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.182
Um, new agenda item.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.117
Phillip will be joining us
at the office today.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.719
- Gotta write that down.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.054
Okay, big day today.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.123
Airing of the documentary.
Who's excited?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.893
- I'd better come out of this
smelling like a rose.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.529
I've been on my best behavior
for nine years.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.897
If it wasn't
for the cameras,

07:11.899 --> 07:14.433
I would've done
some truly vulgar crap.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.867
- Over the course
of this documentary,

07:15.869 --> 07:17.502
I've had three affairs.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.471
If you find my body
in a ditch,

07:19.473 --> 07:21.072
Let me save the police
some trouble.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.074
My wife did it.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.143
- I'm letting you all off
half an hour early

07:25.145 --> 07:27.512
To view the documentary,
so you can make it up to me

07:27.514 --> 07:29.581
By working an extra
half an hour tomorrow

07:29.583 --> 07:31.650
Or a minute extra
for the rest of the month.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.918
- Ooh! Announcement.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.053
Some of us whose televisions
got broken

07:35.055 --> 07:37.122
During an all-you-can-eat
shrimp commercial

07:37.124 --> 07:39.591
Will be watching tonight
at poor richard's.

07:39.593 --> 07:43.728
But note, all are welcome,
not just those

07:43.730 --> 07:45.964
Who saw an all-you-can-eat
shrimp commercial

07:45.966 --> 07:48.533
And charged
their televisions.

07:48.535 --> 07:51.203
- I can't believe the doc
is finally going to air.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.938
When this thing started,

07:52.940 --> 07:54.906
I was still having sex
with women.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.742
As was kevin, I believe.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.077
- This airs tonight?

07:59.079 --> 08:01.546
Oh, my god.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.716
If my parents see this,
I am toast.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.788
- This is really huge.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.022
This is like
the March on washington,

08:11.024 --> 08:12.023
But for a singing show.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.525
- Whoo-hoo!

08:13.527 --> 08:15.026
- Can you imagine if
martin luther king were here

08:15.028 --> 08:17.195
And sang <i>I dreamed a dream</i>
<i>from</i> <i>les mis?</i>

08:17.197 --> 08:19.698
With that baritone?
<i>That</i> would be historic.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.167
- Whoo-hoo! Casey dean!
Cincinnati, ohio!

08:22.169 --> 08:23.869
- Whoa.
- â™ª doctor, doctor

08:23.871 --> 08:25.036
â™ª gimme the news

08:25.038 --> 08:27.739
â™ª I got a great casey dean
for you â™ª

08:27.741 --> 08:29.541
- No.
- America wants it!

08:29.543 --> 08:31.743
- No, this is my time!
You don't belt on my time!

08:31.745 --> 08:34.880
I belt on my time!
- â™ª casey deee-eee-eeean

08:34.882 --> 08:38.950
- â™ª casey
de-ee-ee-ee-ee-ean â™ª

08:42.088 --> 08:43.588
- Man, those are
some nice pipes!

08:43.590 --> 08:45.891
- Yeah.
- What's your name?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.526
- Andy.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.528
What's yours?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.863
- Why didn't you pack
the apple snacks?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.099
- Why didn't you
pack the apple snacks?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.133
- Guys.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.701
- Because whenever
I pack the bag,

08:56.703 --> 08:57.903
You say I do it wrong.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.904
- Guys.
- Why don't you pack it?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.805
- Guys.
- Kevin, what?

09:00.807 --> 09:05.010
Of a weatherman
who says "bold front"

09:05.012 --> 09:06.645
Instead of "cold front"?

09:06.647 --> 09:07.879
It's insane.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.148
- Not now, kevin.
Can't you see we're busy?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.183
Phillip needs
his apple snacks.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.585
- Seriously, kevin.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.886
I'm just gonna have to go
to the store.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.087
- Okay, you go to the store.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.189
- Phillip, phillip,
phillip.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.725
It's all about phillip.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.628
I hate phillip.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.031
[door opens]

09:26.033 --> 09:27.566
- Not now!
Private time!

09:27.568 --> 09:28.667
- I love <i>star wars</i>
<i>as much as the next guy--</i>

09:28.669 --> 09:32.070
- Hey, hey. Seriously?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.341
- My god, I'm so sorry.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.244
Well, this might
make up for it.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.880
I think I have found
an enormous source

09:41.882 --> 09:43.214
Of overlooked pfn.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.717
- Which is, of course...?

09:45.719 --> 09:46.885
- Potential future nonsense.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.887
- Yes.
Good abbreviating, jim.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.856
That saved some time.
Now, hurry up. Shut the door.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.158
- [sighs]

09:53.160 --> 09:54.159
- Break it down for me.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.293
- I'm gonna need you

09:55.295 --> 09:57.195
To look at
your hierarchy mobile.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.931
You've got a regional manager.
- The power source.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.067
- Obviously, the assistant
to the regional manager.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.768
- A loyal
but bungling apostle.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.737
- But what about
the    <i>assista</i>assistant

10:05.739 --> 10:07.906
To the regional manager?

10:12.645 --> 10:14.980
- Someone to whisper in the ear
of the consigliore.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.815
- Exactly.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.950
- I'd have to get
some more wire and string,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.251
But it's doable.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.621
Do you think any of them
out there are capable?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.991
I mean, unless they're
willing to pass some tests.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.093
- I like the sound of that.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.628
Who did you have in mind?

10:29.630 --> 10:30.762
- Well, I know
this sounds crazy,

10:30.764 --> 10:32.364
But how would king arthur

10:32.366 --> 10:34.966
Choose the next knight
of his round table?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.701
- That doesn't sound crazy,
jim.

10:36.703 --> 10:40.305
That's the sanest thing
I've ever heard.

10:41.708 --> 10:45.043
- Hmm? Um, uh, locking in
my starting note.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.711
â™ª a 440

10:46.713 --> 10:47.912
- Oh, sweet.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.014
- A cappella
is all about pitch,

10:49.016 --> 10:50.415
And I am nothing

10:50.417 --> 10:52.651
If not a total
pitch bitch.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.219
- What's up, everybody?

10:54.221 --> 10:57.956
And welcome to <i>america's next</i>
<i>a cappella sensation!</i>

10:57.958 --> 11:00.058
[cheers and applause]

11:00.060 --> 11:02.761
- Oh, my god!
You're gorgeous!

11:02.763 --> 11:04.162
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.196
And thank you for
your patience.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.431
And we hope to see
you guys

11:06.433 --> 11:08.266
Within the next five
to seven hours.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.136
Now, just to give you
a couple parameters of the show,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.738
Each of you will sing a song
for 30 seconds,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.774
After which our judges
will decide

11:15.776 --> 11:18.443
If they want you
in their a cappella group.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.079
Now, each group will start
with 90 singers

11:21.081 --> 11:22.147
Which will compete
in a series

11:22.149 --> 11:24.149
Of singing
and physical challenges.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.152
Oh, and look out
for that pesky mole!

11:27.154 --> 11:28.186
[crowd murmuring]

11:28.188 --> 11:29.187
- There's a mole?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.890
- Oops.
I'm not supposed to--

11:31.892 --> 11:33.124
Not supposed to say that.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.159
All right. No mole.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.393
Forget I said it,
all right?

11:35.395 --> 11:36.461
- What mole?
What are you talking about?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.962
I already forgot about it.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.197
- Good man right there.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.331
I'll see you guys inside.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.900
Good luck, all right?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.134
- Yeah!

11:43.136 --> 11:44.869
Pour some sugar ray
on me!

11:44.871 --> 11:46.471
- What?
On a roll much?

11:46.473 --> 11:47.806
- I don't know
where it came from.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.973
- That was amazing, man!
- Yeah.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.308
Yeah, it felt good.
It felt funny.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.910
- Yeah, you made a personal
connection with him.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.712
- I did. I felt it.
- Big time.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.448
- What are you
so excited about?

11:56.450 --> 11:59.884
- Nothing.
- What are you up to?

11:59.886 --> 12:01.352
[laughs]

12:02.455 --> 12:05.156
- Members of the office,
hear ye.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.725
- That means ye, plop.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.860
- "plop"?
Still?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.462
- We owe andy that much.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.832
- Absolutely, we do.
- Am I right, people?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.834
- Fine.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.335
- Today, we will be
testing candidates

12:17.337 --> 12:19.504
For the position
of assistant

12:19.506 --> 12:21.406
To the assistant
to the regional manager.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.374
- Aw, heck, yeah.
- Nice.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.876
- You'll always have
the upper hand

12:24.878 --> 12:27.912
When you've got
a good "aarm."

12:27.914 --> 12:31.282
- This is not an excuse
to blow off work

12:31.284 --> 12:32.951
Doing carnival-like
activities.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.386
Sure, every participant
will be getting a corn dog,

12:35.388 --> 12:37.055
But that's for fueling only.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.223
No savoring.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.758
- Wow. What an honor.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.826
God, I envy them.
- He envies you.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.194
- You don't need to repeat
right now...

12:43.196 --> 12:44.496
- All right.
- What I'm saying.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.831
- By 2:00,
dwight will choose himself

12:46.833 --> 12:49.267
To be assistant
to his own assistant, me.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.312
- Delivered all my furniture
to philly.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.347
Hey, keep it down, though.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.848
Nobody knows I'm here.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.152
I hate good-byes,
so last week,

13:07.154 --> 13:08.820
When I left
dunder mifflin for good,

13:08.822 --> 13:11.156
I pulled the old
"irish exit."

13:11.158 --> 13:12.390
Just slipped out
with making a big deal.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.493
No hard feelings.
No feelings at all.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.495
[sighs]

13:17.497 --> 13:21.032
- A good assistant knows
what their superior is thinking

13:21.034 --> 13:22.367
Before they even think it.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.502
Meredith, what number
am I thinking of right now?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.404
- Uh, two.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.940
- 985,000,000,000,017.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.375
- [scoffs]
not even close, meredith.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.377
Come on!
- Okay. Pam.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.112
What song is running
through my head right now?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.281
- The theme song
from <i>saved by the bell.</i>

13:36.283 --> 13:38.983
- Oh, my god! It was the
theme song to <i>boy meets world.</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:40.418
- Wait. No, no, no, stop.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.587
You're trying to
give your wife this job.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.123
- That's exactly
what I was doing.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.525
Plop, what animal
am I picturing?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.827
- A horse.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.295
- Ew, the exact opposite,
actually.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.163
- What's the opposite
of a horse?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.198
- Come on.
- A sea horse.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.933
- Sea horse.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.303
Whoa, how did you know
that I was gonna...

13:58.305 --> 14:01.306
Both: Say that?

14:01.308 --> 14:03.041
Both: Uncanny.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.010
- Challenge number two,
protocol.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.312
Clark!
- Yeah.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.980
- Do you want a corn dog?

14:08.982 --> 14:11.115
- I would love a corn dog.
- We'll see.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.551
You are an assistant who's just
gotten a phone message.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.188
I am in a meeting with dwight,
robert dunder, and his niece.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.556
Uh-oh, look who came
to join us.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.092
The turkish ambassador
to armenia,

14:21.094 --> 14:24.062
Is extremely embarrassed
about the size of his nose.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.397
Go ahead and read
that phone message.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.967
- "mr. Halpert,
your wife called to find out

14:28.969 --> 14:30.935
How your meeting
with yuri big nose went."

14:30.937 --> 14:32.103
- No, no, no, no!

14:32.105 --> 14:34.405
You don't read it aloud
like that!

14:34.407 --> 14:36.875
God! Besides, the whole thing
is a trick question.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.310
There's no turkish ambassador
to armenia.

14:39.312 --> 14:43.648
The two countries don't have
diplomatic relations.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.317
- Uncanny.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.020
- I just hope that if my buddies
who are still in afghanistan

14:49.022 --> 14:51.422
See me win, they'll feel like
anything is possible.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.258
- Great. More screen time
for the war vet.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.626
- [scoffs]

14:54.628 --> 14:56.628
- All you gotta do is
risk your life for this country

14:56.630 --> 14:58.396
And everyone goes gaga
for you.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.399
They were interviewing
a homeless, single mother

15:01.401 --> 15:02.400
With three kids.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.369
- What?
- Yeah.

15:04.371 --> 15:09.374
- Is this a show about the
resiliency of the human spirit

15:09.376 --> 15:10.942
Or is it a show
about singing?

15:10.944 --> 15:12.010
- I don't know,

15:12.012 --> 15:13.211
But I'm getting
really worried here.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.280
- Me too.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.015
Hold my place in line.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.150
- Where are you going?

15:19.152 --> 15:21.486
- They want
feel-good stories?

15:21.488 --> 15:24.222
Wait till they get
a good feel of me.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.492
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.160
- Yep. Take care.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.397
- Darryl, hey.
- Hey.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.665
- Cool. Are you coming back
to say hi?

15:33.667 --> 15:36.234
- No, no.
I'm not here, actually.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.936
These doughnuts
are part of my escape

15:37.938 --> 15:40.004
From the guys at the warehouse
I didn't say good-bye to.

15:40.006 --> 15:43.308
- Aha! How's athlead?
- We livin' like rock stars.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.110
I'm about to eat free steak
with my sports heroes

15:46.112 --> 15:47.412
In 32 different cities.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.513
- Wow.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.081
- Jim really
doesn't want to come?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.082
- He says he doesn't want to.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.283
- Wow. Man.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.518
I hope he doesn't
regret it.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.420
- Well, he seems
really happy

15:55.422 --> 15:57.388
Being back here
at dunder mifflin.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.425
- [laughs] jim is happy here,
selling paper at dunder mifflin?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.693
- That's what he says.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.428
- If you say so.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.229
Hey, good seeing you.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.631
Remember, I was never here.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.466
All right, then.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.968
[door opens]

16:09.970 --> 16:11.569
- An assistant
brings their boss coffee

16:11.571 --> 16:13.338
With speed and dexterity,

16:13.340 --> 16:15.406
But an assistant
<i>to</i> the assistant

16:15.408 --> 16:16.674
Has a thousand times more
to prove, am I right?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.109
- A thousand times more.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.411
- I'll try this one.
- Phyllis.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.213
Grab both these coffees,
double fist it,

16:22.215 --> 16:23.214
And head through
this obstacle course.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.183
- Okay. Ooh, it's hot.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.385
- Yeah. It's real.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.253
It's the only way
you'll learn. Okay.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.290
And go ahead.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.226
Oh, god, nice.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.527
She's through the green,
everybody.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.196
Here comes yellow.
- No, no, no, no.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.330
- A real doozy.
- Oh, boy.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.065
- Phyllis, seriously?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.200
- Look at that form.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.301
- Oh, my god,
that's just pathetic!

16:43.303 --> 16:45.003
The boss needs his coffee!
- [gasps]

16:45.005 --> 16:47.071
- Wow.
- [grunts]

16:47.073 --> 16:48.072
[gasps]

16:48.074 --> 16:50.541
[grunts]

16:50.543 --> 16:51.676
[gasps]

16:51.678 --> 16:53.011
Here you are, sir!

16:53.013 --> 16:54.078
Here's your coffee!

16:54.080 --> 16:55.680
Ow! My skin!
Ow! Ow!

16:55.682 --> 16:57.448
Aah! It burns! Aah!

16:57.450 --> 16:59.450
Aah! Aah!
[bell dings]

16:59.452 --> 17:01.352
- Uncanny.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.023
[applause]

17:05.025 --> 17:06.657
- Darryl?
Darryl!

17:06.659 --> 17:09.360
- Oh! Oh, hey!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.529
Hey, what's up, y'all?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.698
- You left us
without saying good-bye!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.700
- Oh. My bad.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.435
Good-bye, everybody.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.770
- No, that is totally uncool!
- Hey, no way!

17:18.772 --> 17:21.039
- Are you kidding?

17:21.041 --> 17:22.373
You broke our hearts.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.441
Get upstairs.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.509
- I don't think I should--

17:24.511 --> 17:25.676
- Get upstairs, mister!

17:25.678 --> 17:27.678
- Yeah!
- Right now!

17:27.680 --> 17:29.313
- So, I'm going upstairs.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.316
This whole search
for the assistant thing,

17:32.318 --> 17:33.785
None of these people
are good enough.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.086
- I know.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.357
Makes no logical sense,
and yet it might be

17:39.359 --> 17:40.792
The most logical thing
I've ever said.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.560
- Jim, this is gonna come
as no surprise,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.362
But I know exactly
what you were gonna say.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.698
The only possible assistant
to my assistant...

17:47.700 --> 17:49.333
- Is...

17:49.335 --> 17:50.334
- Me.

17:50.336 --> 17:55.506
The new assistant
to the assistant

17:55.508 --> 17:58.109
To the regional manager
is...

17:58.111 --> 17:59.110
Dwight k. Schrute.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.412
- Yes!
[halfhearted applause]

18:01.414 --> 18:05.416
- I think you might
want to kneel for this.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.251
And yet, the manager
for dunder mifflin

18:07.253 --> 18:08.786
Kneels for no man.

18:11.690 --> 18:12.690
- Wait.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.292
- That's it.
- Okay.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.660
- You look really,
really good.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.729
[applause]

18:25.671 --> 18:27.705
- Okay, from now on,

18:27.707 --> 18:29.507
Anyone who needs
to speak to me

18:29.509 --> 18:33.411
Has got to go
through me first, all right?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.446
[exhales]

18:37.883 --> 18:41.119
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.187
- You all right?

18:44.423 --> 18:46.357
What's going on?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.326
- Are you happy?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.595
- Yes, I'm happy.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.563
- No, I know that
you're, like, happy,

18:52.565 --> 18:54.165
And, like,
you had fun today.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.299
- Yeah.
- And that was fun.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.702
But what about a year from now?
- What?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.370
- What about
five years from now?

18:59.372 --> 19:00.771
- Pam.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.273
- Because I'm so glad
you're back, baby,

19:02.275 --> 19:04.275
But I'm just--I was
talking to darryl,

19:04.277 --> 19:06.577
And he was talking
about the trip,

19:06.579 --> 19:09.480
And I just feel like
you're giving up so much.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.749
- This was my decision,
not yours.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.217
- Okay.
- You didn't force me.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.253
- You did not force me
to do this.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.387
- Yes, I did.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.490
And I'm afraid that...
- Resent you?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.758
- This is not enough
for you,

19:20.760 --> 19:23.227
And I'm afraid that
I'm not enough for you.

19:23.229 --> 19:26.397
- Is that really
what you think?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.468
Not enough?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.303
I don't know how else
to explain it to her,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.672
So...You know what?

19:34.674 --> 19:35.873
I know
it's against the rules,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.609
But I'm gonna need
a favor from you guys.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.545
- Okay.
You got it, man.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.534
- We're all a little hormonal
with the doc airing.

20:59.536 --> 21:01.169
- Are you gonna come
to poor richard's

21:01.171 --> 21:02.436
And watch with us tonight?

21:02.438 --> 21:05.173
- Uh...Yeah.

21:05.175 --> 21:06.440
Depending on traffic.

21:06.442 --> 21:07.809
- He ain't coming.

21:07.811 --> 21:10.344
- Oh, god!

21:10.346 --> 21:13.514
- These dudes are definitely
in a weird mood.

21:13.516 --> 21:16.417
Picked the wrong day
to return a truck.

21:16.419 --> 21:17.885
Well, it's been great.

21:17.887 --> 21:18.986
- 11 years.

21:18.988 --> 21:20.555
A guy is in your life
for 11 years,

21:20.557 --> 21:22.557
And then he's gone
for who knows how long.

21:22.559 --> 21:24.592
- Maybe forever.
Anyhow--

21:24.594 --> 21:26.460
- Did we ever
have lunch together,

21:26.462 --> 21:28.596
Just--just the two of us?

21:28.598 --> 21:30.965
You know what,
I'm gonna make reservations

21:30.967 --> 21:32.433
Right now at cugino's.

21:32.435 --> 21:33.601
- Question for darryl.

21:33.603 --> 21:35.136
Did we ever get loaded

21:35.138 --> 21:36.470
And listen to zeppelin
in my van?

21:36.472 --> 21:38.606
- Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.

21:38.608 --> 21:41.509
- Nah, I call
one hour van time with darryl.

21:41.511 --> 21:43.077
- Darryl, you know,
I would love

21:43.079 --> 21:44.545
To just record
some of your stories,

21:44.547 --> 21:45.913
Just let the tape roll

21:45.915 --> 21:47.415
For six or eight
or ten hours,

21:47.417 --> 21:49.417
And just see what we get.

21:49.419 --> 21:50.885
- Listen, guys,
we can do it all.

21:50.887 --> 21:52.920
We just have to divide
darryl's next 12 hours

21:52.922 --> 21:57.158
I will go watch an ehow video
on how to use excel,

21:57.160 --> 21:58.492
And then
we'll get this started.

21:58.494 --> 22:01.062
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

22:01.064 --> 22:03.598
Okay, I made the mistake
of sneaking out of here,

22:03.600 --> 22:05.032
And that's on me.

22:05.034 --> 22:08.236
But I'm not gonna spend
the rest of the day here

22:08.238 --> 22:11.038
Doing stuff with you 'cause
you're feeling sentimental.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.307
- You have to!
- Come on!

22:13.309 --> 22:16.410
- Hey, hey, hey.
I'll do one thing with y'all.

22:16.412 --> 22:17.645
- Which thing?

22:17.647 --> 22:19.347
- I don't care.
Choose amongst yourselves.

22:19.349 --> 22:23.150
Not the van though.

22:23.152 --> 22:26.087
[rhythmic tapping]

22:26.089 --> 22:27.555
- Kevin, kevin.

22:27.557 --> 22:29.557
- Oh, you know my name.

22:29.559 --> 22:32.360
Well, that is shocking.

22:32.362 --> 22:34.328
- Kevin, could you
not do that?

22:34.330 --> 22:38.466
I'm moving the ink
down in my pen, for work.

22:38.468 --> 22:40.501
- Here, use my pen.

22:40.503 --> 22:41.435
- Don't tell me what to do!

22:41.437 --> 22:42.436
Both: Shh!

22:42.438 --> 22:44.171
- No, I don't need this.

22:44.173 --> 22:46.440
And you obviously
don't need me.

22:46.442 --> 22:48.109
- Kevin, where are you going?

22:48.111 --> 22:49.543
- Away.

22:49.545 --> 22:53.581
Tell phillip that his stupid
little baby wish came true.

22:56.485 --> 22:58.252
- He just won't go down.

22:58.254 --> 23:00.588
It's as if he's excited
by all this paper.

23:00.590 --> 23:02.623
- I know, earlier today
he tried to eat

23:02.625 --> 23:05.259
Some of the 24-weight
letter bond.

23:05.261 --> 23:06.627
- Smart baby.

23:06.629 --> 23:10.631
That's the most
flavorful bond.

23:15.671 --> 23:17.571
- Hey, what's going on
over here,

23:17.573 --> 23:20.441
Some sort of singing
competition for the young'uns?

23:20.443 --> 23:21.575
- You're back.

23:21.577 --> 23:23.311
- No, it's me, andy.

23:23.313 --> 23:24.512
- No, I know.

23:24.514 --> 23:26.013
- No, no, no,
I'm wearing makeup.

23:26.015 --> 23:27.548
- You did a really great job.

23:27.550 --> 23:29.050
You even look shorter.

23:29.052 --> 23:30.584
- Oh, I took out my lifts.
- Oh.

23:30.586 --> 23:31.719
- Yeah, unlike andy bernard,

23:31.721 --> 23:33.587
This character
is my real height.

23:33.589 --> 23:34.689
- Oh.

23:34.691 --> 23:36.724
- All day long,
it's moo the cows

23:36.726 --> 23:38.693
And cluck the hens.

23:38.695 --> 23:40.361
- Mm-hmm.
- Get the sheep baa-ed.

23:40.363 --> 23:41.595
Oink the pigs.

23:41.597 --> 23:44.231
- Oink the pigs,
that is very important.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.467
- Dwight, I'm telling you
about all the things

23:46.469 --> 23:49.070
That ma said after the horse
kicked her in the head.

23:49.072 --> 23:51.539
Where are you?

23:51.541 --> 23:53.107
Dwight?

23:53.109 --> 23:55.142
- The way that boy
looks at the <i>galactica</i>

23:55.144 --> 23:58.212
Is precisely the way
I look at the <i>galactica.</i>

23:58.214 --> 24:01.549
And he eats the same kind
of paper I do.

24:01.551 --> 24:03.584
Hmm.

24:10.592 --> 24:13.194
Thank you, esther.
- Bye.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.339
- You threw the summoning bag
at me, sir?

24:25.341 --> 24:27.475
- I need you
to perform a test.

24:27.477 --> 24:30.311
- Perform a test.
- On an innocent baby.

24:30.313 --> 24:32.613
- Ooh, I like where
this is going.

24:32.615 --> 24:34.281
Unfortunately, I have a lot
on my plate today,

24:34.283 --> 24:36.384
So I'm gonna have to hand
this off to my number two.

24:36.386 --> 24:37.551
But don't worry,

24:37.553 --> 24:39.453
He's the best in the biz.

24:39.455 --> 24:41.288
- Damn straight.

24:41.290 --> 24:42.556
- Unless you think
he can't handle it.

24:42.558 --> 24:45.693
- Hey, he can handle it.
- All right.

24:52.068 --> 24:55.503
You don't want to wake up
the grumpy old walrus, do you?

24:55.505 --> 24:57.304
- I heard that.

24:57.306 --> 24:59.140
- Mama.

24:59.142 --> 25:00.808
- Hey, you want me to take
the little diaper blaster?

25:00.810 --> 25:02.510
Pam can attest,
there's no one better

25:02.512 --> 25:05.479
At getting brats
to shut their yaps.

25:05.481 --> 25:06.814
- He does have a gift.

25:06.816 --> 25:08.516
- Well, he's calling
for his mom,

25:08.518 --> 25:10.484
But, okay, here,
here you go.

25:10.486 --> 25:12.286
Careful, he bites.
- Mama.

25:12.288 --> 25:14.789
- Okay.

25:14.791 --> 25:19.460
You ever been
in a manager's office before?

25:19.462 --> 25:21.429
Phillip, you wanna play
a little game?

25:21.431 --> 25:23.531
It's called
"schrute or consequences."

25:23.533 --> 25:25.766
You're gonna choose
one of these two things,

25:25.768 --> 25:30.137
A check for
a million dollars

25:30.139 --> 25:33.140
Or this dirty old beet.

25:33.142 --> 25:35.376
Yuck, pew!

25:35.378 --> 25:38.312
Which will it be?

25:38.314 --> 25:42.083
Money or the beet?

25:42.085 --> 25:44.652
- Beet.
- Yeah.

25:44.654 --> 25:46.420
- [babbles]

25:46.422 --> 25:48.389
- Any ordinary child
would have taken the money,

25:48.391 --> 25:50.091
But you're no ordinary child,
are you?

25:50.093 --> 25:51.459
No.

25:51.461 --> 25:56.397
I can tell by your gorgeous,
widely-set eyes.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.702
- Sorry, folks, the judges
are totally swamped.

26:01.704 --> 26:03.404
We are all done
taking auditions.

26:03.406 --> 26:06.273
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what?

26:06.275 --> 26:07.808
- But thanks for coming out
and please be sure

26:07.810 --> 26:10.377
To watch <i>america's next</i>
<i>a cappella sensa--</i>

26:10.379 --> 26:11.445
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't do that.

26:11.447 --> 26:12.680
- Yeah--
- you can't do that.

26:12.682 --> 26:14.415
We've all been waiting!
- Okay.

26:14.417 --> 26:15.716
- I am going in there.
Don't--

26:15.718 --> 26:17.351
- No, you're not, sir.
- Don't--don't--

26:17.353 --> 26:18.419
- Please don't.
- Don't touch me.

26:18.421 --> 26:20.488
- I'm not touching you.
Okay.

26:20.490 --> 26:21.489
- No!

26:21.491 --> 26:23.457
Run, old man! Run!
- Ow.

26:23.459 --> 26:26.327
- Run! Run for your life!

26:26.329 --> 26:27.895
Get off. Don't you dare.
Don't get--I could see it.

26:27.897 --> 26:30.131
You were gonna get handsy
with me.

26:30.133 --> 26:31.432
Not interested.

26:31.434 --> 26:32.733
I'm casey dean!

26:32.735 --> 26:34.368
You'll be seeing
the last of me!

26:34.370 --> 26:38.839
Or--I meant you won't
be seeing the last of me!

26:40.375 --> 26:41.509
- Hey.

26:41.511 --> 26:43.210
Did you manage
to feed him?

26:43.212 --> 26:47.882
- That's because this baby
is of superior intelligence.

26:47.884 --> 26:49.316
He can tell when
he's being tricked

26:49.318 --> 26:52.153
Out of the experience
of a real human breast.

26:52.155 --> 26:53.320
- Come on.

26:53.322 --> 26:54.688
- He's not that smart.

26:54.690 --> 26:58.192
He doesn't know
where I hid his duck.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.466
- â™ª I am beautiful

27:05.468 --> 27:09.270
â™ª no matter
what they say â™ª

27:09.272 --> 27:13.340
â™ª yes, words
can't bring me down â™ª

27:13.342 --> 27:14.408
[thudding]

27:14.410 --> 27:15.442
â™ª whoa

27:15.444 --> 27:16.577
- Hi.
- â™ª whoa-oh-no

27:16.579 --> 27:18.712
- You're still here.
Oh, thank god.

27:18.714 --> 27:21.448
- Clay aiken,
santigold, aaron rodgers.

27:21.450 --> 27:23.450
You're, like, my three
favorite people ever.

27:23.452 --> 27:25.419
- Excuse me,
what is this?

27:25.421 --> 27:26.954
- Sweetheart,
you're amazing, okay?

27:26.956 --> 27:29.290
You're obviously gonna
be on the show.

27:29.292 --> 27:30.457
So it's someone else's
turn now.

27:30.459 --> 27:33.494
Yeah.
Go ahead, all right?

27:33.496 --> 27:34.595
Um...
[clears throat]

27:34.597 --> 27:37.464
[old man voice]
my name is ezra cornell

27:37.466 --> 27:41.435
And I'm just a kindly old fellow
with a song in my heart.

27:41.437 --> 27:45.272
- No, you're a middle-aged man
with a lot of makeup on.

27:45.274 --> 27:46.707
- Busted.

27:46.709 --> 27:48.342
Got it.
Yes, all right.

27:48.344 --> 27:50.211
Tried to get your attention
with tricks,

27:50.213 --> 27:52.213
But you just want
to hear me sing.

27:52.215 --> 27:55.583
- [laughs] we do not
want to hear you sing.

27:55.585 --> 27:57.518
- Gabriella
was our last audition.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.621
Thank you. Good-bye.
- Nope! Can't end like this.

28:00.623 --> 28:02.456
Slept in my car last night.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.758
Quit my job,
burned all my bridges.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.393
I went to the bathroom
on my boss's car.

28:06.395 --> 28:09.530
And I did unspeakable things
with carla fern.

28:09.532 --> 28:12.366
- Ugh, flag on the play.
- That's--that's what--yeah.

28:12.368 --> 28:13.567
Okay, all right,
well, here's the song.

28:13.569 --> 28:14.835
[clears throat]

28:14.837 --> 28:18.806
â™ª far above cayuga's waters

28:18.808 --> 28:22.876
â™ª with her waves so blue

It's the cornell fight song.

thank you very much.

28:33.489 --> 28:36.757

That's not fair.

28:36.759 --> 28:38.525

but we've heard a lot

28:38.527 --> 28:41.428
Of really good singers today,
and you're just not good enough.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.464

how you doing, buddy?

29:35.484 --> 29:36.717
- Can't hear you.

29:36.719 --> 29:40.354
I'm giving you
the silence treatment.

29:40.356 --> 29:42.990
How does it feel
being ignored?

29:42.992 --> 29:47.394
- Okay, I guess, it's just
that phillip got you something.

29:47.396 --> 29:50.764
- Yeah, a $25 gift card.
Itunes.

29:50.766 --> 29:52.533
- I think there's,
like, $7 left.

29:52.535 --> 29:54.001
- It's just his way
of saying,

29:54.003 --> 29:57.004
"thanks for letting me
hang out in accounting."

29:57.006 --> 30:00.674
- Phillip got this for me?
- Sure.

30:00.676 --> 30:02.676
- That was
a really cool move.

30:02.678 --> 30:07.014
- Would you like
to hold phillip?

30:07.016 --> 30:08.582
Yeah.

30:08.584 --> 30:10.718
That's kevin.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.553
- Whoa.
- Easy.

30:12.555 --> 30:16.724

[chuckles] whoa.

30:16.726 --> 30:19.460
- I'm losing my balance.
- Now, kevin--no.

30:19.462 --> 30:20.594
- Hey, no.
- Whoa.

30:20.596 --> 30:22.896
- You want to play
with the cactus?

30:22.898 --> 30:24.431
- No.
- No, no.

30:24.433 --> 30:26.967
- So, me and phillip
were just talking

30:26.969 --> 30:31.672
And we decided
we're gonna be best friends.

30:31.674 --> 30:33.640
He's a little standoffish
at first.

30:33.642 --> 30:35.709
But once he starts
buying you things,

30:35.711 --> 30:38.112
Man, you can tell
he likes you.

30:42.584 --> 30:45.085
- We have our decision.

30:45.087 --> 30:46.720
- You chose <i>one</i> thing.

30:46.722 --> 30:49.656
- We want
to dance with you.

30:49.658 --> 30:54.495
- You want to dance?
- One dance. All of us together.

30:54.497 --> 30:56.663
- This is what you want?

30:56.665 --> 30:58.132
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

31:00.001 --> 31:02.536
- Better get some decent
speakers up here then,

31:02.538 --> 31:04.104
'cause we're gonna
do this right.

31:04.106 --> 31:06.006
- Yes!
- [laughs]

31:06.008 --> 31:07.975
- Yeah!

31:07.977 --> 31:09.877
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

31:09.879 --> 31:12.646
- Hey. You wanted
to see me?

31:12.648 --> 31:14.782
- Door. Chair.

31:17.051 --> 31:19.586
It's about phillip.
- I'm sorry he's here today.

31:19.588 --> 31:20.788
But I had--

31:20.790 --> 31:24.458
- I believe that
that boy may be a schrute.

31:24.460 --> 31:28.829
And if he is, that child needs
to be accorded what is his.

31:28.831 --> 31:31.799
An enormous farm,
an inheritance,

31:31.801 --> 31:33.467
And the right
to be raised

31:33.469 --> 31:36.170
Under rigorous
schrute traditions.

31:36.172 --> 31:39.006
You will, of course,
be compensated

31:39.008 --> 31:43.444
With a marriage proposal.

31:43.446 --> 31:45.112
- How thoughtful.

31:45.114 --> 31:46.547
- Then the two of you
would move

31:46.549 --> 31:48.682
To my 1,600-acre estate,
which, let's face it,

31:48.684 --> 31:52.019
Is a big step up from living
in a gay man's closet.

31:52.021 --> 31:55.889
- If he is your son,

31:55.891 --> 31:58.625
That's a great plan.

31:58.627 --> 32:00.627
But he's not.

32:00.629 --> 32:04.631
He's not your son.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.967
- Very well.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.635
- Can I go back
to my desk now?

32:08.637 --> 32:11.772
- Yes.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.050
- What's this?

32:23.052 --> 32:25.619
- Well, I've been trying
to tell you how I feel,

32:25.621 --> 32:27.855
And you wouldn't
believe me,

32:27.857 --> 32:32.659
So...I needed a little help.

32:32.661 --> 32:35.496
- Jim, I need my assistant to
the regional manager, code red.

32:35.498 --> 32:36.997
- Okay, I don't have
my pocket code chart

32:36.999 --> 32:38.265
On me right now, so...

32:38.267 --> 32:41.101
- Now.

32:41.103 --> 32:42.903
- I have an assistant now
who can help you

32:42.905 --> 32:44.271
With whatever you need.

32:44.273 --> 32:45.772
He is lazy,
so crack the whip.

32:45.774 --> 32:49.209
- Jim, I'm not kidding.
I need you.

32:53.047 --> 32:54.748
- Go ahead.

32:54.750 --> 33:00.153
- Okay, um, this is--
I'll be right back.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.293
What do we got?

33:06.295 --> 33:08.996
- I was thinking of proposing
to esther today.

33:08.998 --> 33:12.032
- Wow! Congratulations.
That's a really big step, man.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.001
- She's got a ton
of great qualities.

33:14.003 --> 33:15.202
She's young,
she's beautiful.

33:15.204 --> 33:18.605
Genes so pure

33:18.607 --> 33:21.542
Her family admires me.
My family tolerates hers.

33:21.544 --> 33:22.543
A lot of them
are the same people

33:22.545 --> 33:26.713
Which is great for bloodlines,
and isn't technically incest.

33:26.715 --> 33:28.015

33:28.017 --> 33:29.583
I think you're gonna
be really happy.

a walk-in freezer

33:32.321 --> 33:34.621

premium cattle sperm.

33:34.623 --> 33:36.123
- [whistles]
that's a lot of pros.

33:36.125 --> 33:37.791
- And did I mention
that she weaves?

33:37.793 --> 33:39.626
Colorful, durable
blankets and rugs.

33:39.628 --> 33:40.761
It all adds up.

33:40.763 --> 33:42.663

33:46.334 --> 33:48.669
- [whispers]

34:13.928 --> 34:18.332
- I don't know what
you want me to tell you, man.

34:18.334 --> 34:21.735
All I know is that
every time I've been faced

34:21.737 --> 34:24.905
With a tough decision,

34:24.907 --> 34:27.774
There's only one thing
that outweighs

34:27.776 --> 34:29.176
Every other concern.

34:29.178 --> 34:32.079
One thing that will make you
give up on everything

34:32.081 --> 34:34.615
You thought you knew.

34:34.617 --> 34:39.886
Every instinct,
every rational calculation.

34:39.888 --> 34:41.855

40:41.216 --> 40:43.183
- What do you--dwight!
[tires squeal]

40:43.185 --> 40:46.152
[brakes screech]

40:46.154 --> 40:49.222
Dwight, what the [bleep]
is your problem?

40:49.224 --> 40:50.590
- Shut up, woman!
- Who drives like that?

40:50.592 --> 40:52.359
- Listen to me!
I love you!

40:52.361 --> 40:55.061
And I don't care
that phillip's not my son!

40:55.063 --> 40:58.531
I will raise 100 children
with 100 of your lovers

40:58.533 --> 41:00.400
If it means
I can be with you!

41:01.736 --> 41:03.470
- Can you put that down?

41:03.472 --> 41:06.639
- This expresses how loudly
I love you!

41:06.641 --> 41:08.174
- [whispers]
it's too loud.

41:14.248 --> 41:16.216
- This is a ring

41:16.218 --> 41:18.685
Taken from the buttocks
of my grandmother,

41:18.687 --> 41:22.455
Put there by the gangster
patriarch of the coors dynasty,

41:22.457 --> 41:25.759
Melted in a foundry
run by mennonites.

41:25.761 --> 41:29.029
- Okay. Yes.
Yes, I will!

41:31.699 --> 41:33.767
- [gasps]
- I love you.

41:33.769 --> 41:36.469
- I love you!
[panting]

41:36.471 --> 41:39.305
- And I lied to you.
- What?

41:39.307 --> 41:41.341
- Phillip's your son.

41:41.343 --> 41:42.509
- What?
Why would you say that--

41:42.511 --> 41:45.145
- I just needed you
to want to marry me

41:45.147 --> 41:48.114
Because you wanted to
marry me.

41:48.116 --> 41:51.251
- Get out!

41:51.253 --> 41:53.286
I'm a dad!
- You're a dad!

41:53.288 --> 41:55.388
- [laughs]

41:58.359 --> 42:00.226
[overlapping chatter]

42:00.228 --> 42:02.228
- Hey, grab a seat.

42:02.230 --> 42:03.630
We have that table
and that table,

42:03.632 --> 42:06.733
But not that table
or that table or that table.

42:06.735 --> 42:08.368
Floor's up for grabs.

42:08.370 --> 42:10.370
Meredith has been
hogging the can.

42:11.272 --> 42:13.840
[kiss]
oh!

42:15.342 --> 42:16.643
- You have to change
the channel to pbs.

42:16.645 --> 42:18.711
- Yeah.
- College baseball is on.

42:18.713 --> 42:19.813
- But there's a documentary
coming up.

42:19.815 --> 42:21.247
Everyone in the bar
will love it.

42:21.249 --> 42:22.549
- What's it about?
- A paper company.

42:22.551 --> 42:23.683
- [laughs]

42:23.685 --> 42:25.752
- How many people
want the game?

42:25.754 --> 42:28.521
- Yeah!
- Yes!

42:28.523 --> 42:29.622
- Who wants pbs?

42:29.624 --> 42:32.192
- Whoo!
- Yes!

42:32.194 --> 42:34.561
- Sorry. A tie means
I do nothing.

42:34.563 --> 42:35.829
- Sir, please.

42:35.831 --> 42:38.364
This show is about me

42:38.366 --> 42:43.203
And my attempts to find love
in all the wrong places.

42:43.205 --> 42:44.237
- One more for the doc.

42:44.239 --> 42:46.339
- Hey!
[applause]

42:46.341 --> 42:48.641
[overlapping chatter]
- yay, andy!

42:48.643 --> 42:51.744
- All right.
- Yes!

42:51.746 --> 42:53.246
- Hey, how was
the singing show audition?

42:53.248 --> 42:58.184
- Oh. Eh, whatever.
No big deal.

42:58.186 --> 43:02.122
- Okay.
30 seconds to show time.

43:02.124 --> 43:03.823
- I feel scared a little.

43:03.825 --> 43:05.758
- Yeah, I'm not ready
for this.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.727
- No one is ready for this.
You can't be ready for this.

43:07.729 --> 43:09.329
We don't even know
what this is.

43:09.331 --> 43:13.333
- One thing we do know.
Nothing will ever be the same.

43:13.335 --> 43:15.235
- Here we go.

43:15.237 --> 43:17.203
[upbeat music]

43:17.205 --> 43:20.840
- All right, jim,
your quarterlies look very good.

43:20.842 --> 43:22.408
How are things going
at the library?

43:22.410 --> 43:24.477
- Oh, I told you.
I couldn't close it, so--

43:24.479 --> 43:27.714
- So, you've come
to the master for guidance?

43:27.716 --> 43:29.716
Is this what you're saying,
grasshopper?

43:29.718 --> 43:31.651
- Uh, actually,
you called me in here.

43:31.653 --> 43:34.521
- All right. Well, let me
show you how it's done.
