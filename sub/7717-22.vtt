To look at
your hierarchy mobile.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.931
You've got a regional manager.
- The power source.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.067
- Obviously, the assistant
to the regional manager.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.768
- A loyal
but bungling apostle.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.737
- But what about
the    <i>assista</i>assistant

10:05.739 --> 10:07.906
To the regional manager?

10:12.645 --> 10:14.980
- Someone to whisper in the ear
of the consigliore.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.815
- Exactly.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.950
- I'd have to get
some more wire and string,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.251
But it's doable.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.621
Do you think any of them
out there are capable?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.991
I mean, unless they're
willing to pass some tests.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.093
- I like the sound of that.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.628
Who did you have in mind?

10:29.630 --> 10:30.762
- Well, I know
this sounds crazy,

10:30.764 --> 10:32.364
But how would king arthur

10:32.366 --> 10:34.966
Choose the next knight
of his round table?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.701
- That doesn't sound crazy,
jim.

10:36.703 --> 10:40.305
That's the sanest thing
I've ever heard.

10:41.708 --> 10:45.043
- Hmm? Um, uh, locking in
my starting note.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.711
♪ a 440

10:46.713 --> 10:47.912
- Oh, sweet.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.014

10:49.016 --> 10:50.415
And I am nothing

Now, just to give you
a couple parameters of the show,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.738
Each of you will sing a song

11:13.740 --> 11:15.774
After which our judges
will decide

11:15.776 --> 11:18.443
If they want you
in their a cappella group.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.079
Now, each group will start
with 90 singers

11:21.081 --> 11:22.147
Which will compete

11:24.151 --> 11:27.152
Oh, and look out

[crowd murmuring]

11:28.188 --> 11:29.187

11:29.189 --> 11:31.890
- Oops.
I'm not supposed to--

11:31.892 --> 11:33.124
Not supposed to say that.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.159
All right. No mole.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.393
Forget I said it,
all right?

11:35.395 --> 11:36.461
- What mole?
What are you talking about?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.962
I already forgot about it.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.197
- Good man right there.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.331
I'll see you guys inside.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.900
Good luck, all right?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.134

11:43.136 --> 11:44.869
Pour some sugar ray
on me!

11:44.871 --> 11:46.471
- What?
On a roll much?

11:46.473 --> 11:47.806
- I don't know
where it came from.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.973
- That was amazing, man!
- Yeah.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.308
Yeah, it felt good.
It felt funny.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.910
- Yeah, you made a personal
connection with him.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.712
- I did. I felt it.
- Big time.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.448
- What are you
so excited about?

11:56.450 --> 11:59.884
- Nothing.
- What are you up to?

11:59.886 --> 12:01.352
[laughs]

12:02.455 --> 12:05.156
- Members of the office,
hear ye.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.725
- That means ye, plop.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.860
- "plop"?
Still?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.462
- We owe andy that much.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.832
- Absolutely, we do.
- Am I right, people?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.834
- Fine.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.335
- Today, we will be
testing candidates

For the position
of assistant

12:19.506 --> 12:21.406
To the assistant
to the regional manager.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.374
- Aw, heck, yeah.
- Nice.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.876
- You'll always have
the upper hand

12:24.878 --> 12:27.912
When you've got
a good "aarm."

12:27.914 --> 12:31.282
- This is not an excuse
to blow off work

12:31.284 --> 12:32.951
Doing carnival-like
activities.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.386
Sure, every participant
will be getting a corn dog,

12:35.388 --> 12:37.055
But that's for fueling only.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.223
No savoring.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.758
- Wow. What an honor.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.826
God, I envy them.

right now...

12:43.196 --> 12:44.496
- All right.
- What I'm saying.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.831
- By 2:00,
dwight will choose himself

12:46.833 --> 12:49.267
To be assistant
to his own assistant, me.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.312

13:01.314 --> 13:02.347
Hey, keep it down, though.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.848
Nobody knows I'm here.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.152
I hate good-byes,
so last week,

13:07.154 --> 13:08.820
When I left
dunder mifflin for good,

13:08.822 --> 13:11.156
I pulled the old
"irish exit."

13:11.158 --> 13:12.390
Just slipped out
with making a big deal.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.493
No hard feelings.
No feelings at all.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.495
[sighs]

13:17.497 --> 13:21.032
- A good assistant knows
what their superior is thinking

13:21.034 --> 13:22.367
Before they even think it.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.502
Meredith, what number
am I thinking of right now?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.404
- Uh, two.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.940
- 985,000,000,000,017.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.375
- [scoffs]
not even close, meredith.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.377
Come on!
- Okay. Pam.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.112
What song is running
through my head right now?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.281
- The theme song
from <i>saved by the bell.</i>

13:36.283 --> 13:38.983
- Oh, my god! It was the
theme song to <i>boy meets world.</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:40.418
- Wait. No, no, no, stop.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.587
You're trying to
give your wife this job.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.123
- That's exactly
what I was doing.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.525
Plop, what animal
am I picturing?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.827
- A horse.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.295
- Ew, the exact opposite,
actually.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.163
- What's the opposite
of a horse?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.198
- Come on.
- A sea horse.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.933
- Sea horse.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.303
Whoa, how did you know
that I was gonna...

13:58.305 --> 14:01.306
Both: Say that?

14:01.308 --> 14:03.041
Both: Uncanny.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.010
- Challenge number two,
protocol.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.312
Clark!
- Yeah.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.980
- Do you want a corn dog?

14:08.982 --> 14:11.115
- I would love a corn dog.
- We'll see.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.551
You are an assistant who's just
gotten a phone message.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.188
I am in a meeting with dwight,
robert dunder, and his niece.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.556
Uh-oh, look who came
to join us.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.092
The turkish ambassador
to armenia,

14:21.094 --> 14:24.062
Is extremely embarrassed
about the size of his nose.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.397
Go ahead and read
that phone message.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.967
- "mr. Halpert,
your wife called to find out

14:28.969 --> 14:30.935
How your meeting
with yuri big nose went."

14:30.937 --> 14:32.103
- No, no, no, no!

14:32.105 --> 14:34.405
You don't read it aloud
like that!

14:34.407 --> 14:36.875
God! Besides, the whole thing
is a trick question.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.310
There's no turkish ambassador
to armenia.

14:39.312 --> 14:43.648
The two countries don't have
diplomatic relations.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.317
- Uncanny.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.020
- I just hope that if my buddies
who are still in afghanistan

14:49.022 --> 14:51.422
See me win, they'll feel like
anything is possible.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.258
- Great. More screen time
for the war vet.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.626
- [scoffs]

14:54.628 --> 14:56.628
- All you gotta do is
risk your life for this country

14:56.630 --> 14:58.396
And everyone goes gaga
for you.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.399
They were interviewing
a homeless, single mother

15:01.401 --> 15:02.400
With three kids.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.369
- What?
- Yeah.

15:04.371 --> 15:09.374
- Is this a show about the
resiliency of the human spirit

15:09.376 --> 15:10.942
Or is it a show
about singing?

15:10.944 --> 15:12.010
- I don't know,

15:12.012 --> 15:13.211
But I'm getting
really worried here.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.280
- Me too.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.015
Hold my place in line.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.150
- Where are you going?

15:19.152 --> 15:21.486
- They want
feel-good stories?

15:21.488 --> 15:24.222
Wait till they get
a good feel of me.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.492
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.160
- Yep. Take care.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.397
- Darryl, hey.
- Hey.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.665
- Cool. Are you coming back
to say hi?

15:33.667 --> 15:36.234
- No, no.
I'm not here, actually.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.936
These doughnuts
are part of my escape

15:37.938 --> 15:40.004
From the guys at the warehouse
I didn't say good-bye to.

15:40.006 --> 15:43.308
- Aha! How's athlead?
- We livin' like rock stars.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.110
I'm about to eat free steak
with my sports heroes

15:46.112 --> 15:47.412
In 32 different cities.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.513
- Wow.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.081
- Jim really
doesn't want to come?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.082
- He says he doesn't want to.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.283
- Wow. Man.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.518
I hope he doesn't
regret it.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.420
- Well, he seems
really happy

15:55.422 --> 15:57.388
Being back here
at dunder mifflin.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.425
- [laughs] jim is happy here,
selling paper at dunder mifflin?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.693
- That's what he says.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.428
- If you say so.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.229
Hey, good seeing you.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.631
Remember, I was never here.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.466
All right, then.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.968

16:16.676 --> 16:18.109
- A thousand times more.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.411
- I'll try this one.
- Phyllis.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.213
Grab both these coffees,
double fist it,

16:22.215 --> 16:23.214
And head through
this obstacle course.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.183

16:25.185 --> 16:27.385
- Yeah. It's real.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.253

- Oh, boy.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.065
- Phyllis, seriously?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.200

Good-bye, everybody.

You broke our hearts.

Get upstairs.

- Yeah!
- Right now!

17:29.315 --> 17:32.316
This whole search
for the assistant thing,

17:32.318 --> 17:33.785
None of these people
are good enough.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.086
- I know.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.357
Makes no logical sense,
and yet it might be

17:39.359 --> 17:40.792
The most logical thing
I've ever said.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.560
- Jim, this is gonna come
as no surprise,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.362
But I know exactly
what you were gonna say.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.698
The only possible assistant

- Me.

The new assistant

17:59.112 --> 18:01.412
- Yes!
[halfhearted applause]

18:01.414 --> 18:05.416
- I think you might
want to kneel for this.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.251
And yet, the manager
for dunder mifflin

18:07.253 --> 18:08.786
Kneels for no man.

18:11.690 --> 18:12.690
- Wait.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.292
- That's it.
- Okay.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.660
- You look really,
really good.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.729
[applause]

18:25.671 --> 18:27.705
- Okay, from now on,

18:27.707 --> 18:29.507
Anyone who needs
to speak to me

18:29.509 --> 18:33.411
Has got to go
through me first, all right?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.446
[exhales]

18:37.883 --> 18:41.119
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.187
- You all right?

18:44.423 --> 18:46.357
What's going on?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.326
- Are you happy?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.595
- Yes, I'm happy.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.563
- No, I know that
you're, like, happy,

18:52.565 --> 18:54.165
And, like,
you had fun today.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.299
- Yeah.
- And that was fun.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.702
But what about a year from now?
- What?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.370
- What about
five years from now?

18:59.372 --> 19:00.771
- Pam.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.273
- Because I'm so glad
you're back, baby,

19:02.275 --> 19:04.275
But I'm just--I was
talking to darryl,

19:04.277 --> 19:06.577
And he was talking
about the trip,

19:06.579 --> 19:09.480
And I just feel like
you're giving up so much.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.749
- This was my decision,
not yours.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.217
- Okay.
- You didn't force me.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.253
- You did not force me
to do this.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.387
- Yes, I did.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.490
And I'm afraid that...
- Resent you?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.758
- This is not enough
for you,

19:20.760 --> 19:23.227
And I'm afraid that
I'm not enough for you.

19:23.229 --> 19:26.397
- Is that really
what you think?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.468
Not enough?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.303
I don't know how else
to explain it to her,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.672
So...You know what?

19:34.674 --> 19:35.873
I know
it's against the rules,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.609
But I'm gonna need
a favor from you guys.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.545
- Okay.
You got it, man.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.534
- We're all a little hormonal
with the doc airing.

20:59.536 --> 21:01.169
- Are you gonna come
to poor richard's

21:01.171 --> 21:02.436
And watch with us tonight?

21:02.438 --> 21:05.173
- Uh...Yeah.

21:05.175 --> 21:06.440
Depending on traffic.

21:06.442 --> 21:07.809
- He ain't coming.

21:07.811 --> 21:10.344
- Oh, god!

21:10.346 --> 21:13.514
- These dudes are definitely
in a weird mood.

21:13.516 --> 21:16.417
Picked the wrong day
to return a truck.

21:16.419 --> 21:17.885
Well, it's been great.

21:17.887 --> 21:18.986
- 11 years.

21:18.988 --> 21:20.555
A guy is in your life
for 11 years,

21:20.557 --> 21:22.557
And then he's gone
for who knows how long.

21:22.559 --> 21:24.592
- Maybe forever.
Anyhow--

21:24.594 --> 21:26.460
- Did we ever
have lunch together,

21:26.462 --> 21:28.596
Just--just the two of us?

21:28.598 --> 21:30.965
You know what,
I'm gonna make reservations

21:30.967 --> 21:32.433
Right now at cugino's.

21:32.435 --> 21:33.601
- Question for darryl.

21:33.603 --> 21:35.136
Did we ever get loaded

21:35.138 --> 21:36.470
And listen to zeppelin
in my van?

21:36.472 --> 21:38.606
- Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.

21:38.608 --> 21:41.509
- Nah, I call
one hour van time with darryl.

21:41.511 --> 21:43.077
- Darryl, you know,
I would love

21:43.079 --> 21:44.545
To just record
some of your stories,

21:44.547 --> 21:45.913
Just let the tape roll

21:45.915 --> 21:47.415
For six or eight
or ten hours,

21:47.417 --> 21:49.417
And just see what we get.

21:49.419 --> 21:50.885
- Listen, guys,
we can do it all.

21:50.887 --> 21:52.920
We just have to divide
darryl's next 12 hours

21:52.922 --> 21:57.158
I will go watch an ehow video
on how to use excel,

21:57.160 --> 21:58.492
And then
we'll get this started.

21:58.494 --> 22:01.062
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

22:01.064 --> 22:03.598
Okay, I made the mistake
of sneaking out of here,

22:03.600 --> 22:05.032
And that's on me.

22:05.034 --> 22:08.236
But I'm not gonna spend
the rest of the day here

22:08.238 --> 22:11.038
Doing stuff with you 'cause
you're feeling sentimental.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.307
- You have to!
- Come on!

22:13.309 --> 22:16.410
- Hey, hey, hey.
I'll do one thing with y'all.

22:16.412 --> 22:17.645
- Which thing?

22:17.647 --> 22:19.347
- I don't care.
Choose amongst yourselves.

22:19.349 --> 22:23.150
Not the van though.

22:23.152 --> 22:26.087
[rhythmic tapping]

22:26.089 --> 22:27.555
- Kevin, kevin.

22:27.557 --> 22:29.557
- Oh, you know my name.

22:29.559 --> 22:32.360
Well, that is shocking.

22:32.362 --> 22:34.328
- Kevin, could you
not do that?

22:34.330 --> 22:38.466
I'm moving the ink
down in my pen, for work.

22:38.468 --> 22:40.501
- Here, use my pen.

22:40.503 --> 22:41.435
- Don't tell me what to do!

22:41.437 --> 22:42.436
Both: Shh!

22:42.438 --> 22:44.171
- No, I don't need this.

22:44.173 --> 22:46.440
And you obviously
don't need me.

22:46.442 --> 22:48.109
- Kevin, where are you going?

22:48.111 --> 22:49.543
- Away.

22:49.545 --> 22:53.581
Tell phillip that his stupid
little baby wish came true.

22:56.485 --> 22:58.252
- He just won't go down.

22:58.254 --> 23:00.588
It's as if he's excited
by all this paper.

23:00.590 --> 23:02.623
- I know, earlier today
he tried to eat

23:02.625 --> 23:05.259
Some of the 24-weight
letter bond.

23:05.261 --> 23:06.627
- Smart baby.

23:06.629 --> 23:10.631
That's the most
flavorful bond.

23:15.671 --> 23:17.571
- Hey, what's going on
over here,

23:17.573 --> 23:20.441
Some sort of singing
competition for the young'uns?

23:20.443 --> 23:21.575
- You're back.

23:21.577 --> 23:23.311
- No, it's me, andy.

23:23.313 --> 23:24.512
- No, I know.

23:24.514 --> 23:26.013
- No, no, no,
I'm wearing makeup.

23:26.015 --> 23:27.548
- You did a really great job.

23:27.550 --> 23:29.050
You even look shorter.

23:29.052 --> 23:30.584
- Oh, I took out my lifts.
- Oh.

23:30.586 --> 23:31.719
- Yeah, unlike andy bernard,

23:31.721 --> 23:33.587
This character
is my real height.

23:33.589 --> 23:34.689
- Oh.

23:34.691 --> 23:36.724
- All day long,
it's moo the cows

23:36.726 --> 23:38.693
And cluck the hens.

23:38.695 --> 23:40.361
- Mm-hmm.
- Get the sheep baa-ed.

23:40.363 --> 23:41.595
Oink the pigs.

23:41.597 --> 23:44.231
- Oink the pigs,
that is very important.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.467
- Dwight, I'm telling you
about all the things

23:46.469 --> 23:49.070
That ma said after the horse
kicked her in the head.

23:49.072 --> 23:51.539
Where are you?

23:51.541 --> 23:53.107
Dwight?

23:53.109 --> 23:55.142
- The way that boy
looks at the <i>galactica</i>

23:55.144 --> 23:58.212
Is precisely the way
I look at the <i>galactica.</i>

23:58.214 --> 24:01.549
And he eats the same kind
of paper I do.

24:01.551 --> 24:03.584
Hmm.

24:10.592 --> 24:13.194
Thank you, esther.
- Bye.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.339
- You threw the summoning bag
at me, sir?

24:25.341 --> 24:27.475
- I need you
to perform a test.

24:27.477 --> 24:30.311
- Perform a test.
- On an innocent baby.

24:30.313 --> 24:32.613
- Ooh, I like where
this is going.

24:32.615 --> 24:34.281
Unfortunately, I have a lot
on my plate today,

24:34.283 --> 24:36.384
So I'm gonna have to hand
this off to my number two.

24:36.386 --> 24:37.551
But don't worry,

24:37.553 --> 24:39.453
He's the best in the biz.

24:39.455 --> 24:41.288
- Damn straight.

24:41.290 --> 24:42.556
- Unless you think
he can't handle it.

24:42.558 --> 24:45.693
- Hey, he can handle it.
- All right.

24:52.068 --> 24:55.503
You don't want to wake up
the grumpy old walrus, do you?

24:55.505 --> 24:57.304
- I heard that.

24:57.306 --> 24:59.140
- Mama.

24:59.142 --> 25:00.808
- Hey, you want me to take
the little diaper blaster?

25:00.810 --> 25:02.510
Pam can attest,
there's no one better

25:02.512 --> 25:05.479
At getting brats
to shut their yaps.

25:05.481 --> 25:06.814
- He does have a gift.

25:06.816 --> 25:08.516
- Well, he's calling
for his mom,

25:08.518 --> 25:10.484
But, okay, here,
here you go.

25:10.486 --> 25:12.286
Careful, he bites.
- Mama.

25:12.288 --> 25:14.789
- Okay.

25:14.791 --> 25:19.460
You ever been
in a manager's office before?

25:19.462 --> 25:21.429
Phillip, you wanna play
a little game?

25:21.431 --> 25:23.531
It's called
"schrute or consequences."

25:23.533 --> 25:25.766
You're gonna choose
one of these two things,

25:25.768 --> 25:30.137
A check for
a million dollars

25:30.139 --> 25:33.140
Or this dirty old beet.

25:33.142 --> 25:35.376
Yuck, pew!

25:35.378 --> 25:38.312
Which will it be?

25:38.314 --> 25:42.083
Money or the beet?

25:42.085 --> 25:44.652
- Beet.
- Yeah.

25:44.654 --> 25:46.420
- [babbles]

25:46.422 --> 25:48.389
- Any ordinary child
would have taken the money,

25:48.391 --> 25:50.091
But you're no ordinary child,
are you?

25:50.093 --> 25:51.459
No.

25:51.461 --> 25:56.397
I can tell by your gorgeous,
widely-set eyes.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.702
- Sorry, folks, the judges
are totally swamped.

26:01.704 --> 26:03.404
We are all done
taking auditions.

26:03.406 --> 26:06.273
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what?

26:06.275 --> 26:07.808
- But thanks for coming out
and please be sure

26:07.810 --> 26:10.377
To watch <i>america's next</i>
<i>a cappella sensa--</i>

26:10.379 --> 26:11.445
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't do that.

26:11.447 --> 26:12.680
- Yeah--
- you can't do that.

26:12.682 --> 26:14.415
We've all been waiting!
- Okay.

26:14.417 --> 26:15.716
- I am going in there.
Don't--

26:15.718 --> 26:17.351
- No, you're not, sir.
- Don't--don't--

26:17.353 --> 26:18.419
- Please don't.
- Don't touch me.

26:18.421 --> 26:20.488
- I'm not touching you.
Okay.

26:20.490 --> 26:21.489
- No!

26:21.491 --> 26:23.457
Run, old man! Run!
- Ow.

26:23.459 --> 26:26.327
- Run! Run for your life!

26:26.329 --> 26:27.895
Get off. Don't you dare.
Don't get--I could see it.

26:27.897 --> 26:30.131
You were gonna get handsy
with me.

26:30.133 --> 26:31.432
Not interested.

26:31.434 --> 26:32.733
I'm casey dean!

26:32.735 --> 26:34.368
You'll be seeing

26:34.370 --> 26:38.839
Or--I meant you won't
be seeing the last of me!

26:40.375 --> 26:41.509
- Hey.

26:41.511 --> 26:43.210
Did you manage
to feed him?

26:43.212 --> 26:47.882
- That's because this baby
is of superior intelligence.

26:47.884 --> 26:49.316
He can tell when
he's being tricked

26:49.318 --> 26:52.153
Out of the experience
of a real human breast.

26:52.155 --> 26:53.320
- Come on.

26:53.322 --> 26:54.688
- He's not that smart.

want to hear you sing.

Thank you. Good-bye.

40:50.592 --> 40:52.359
- Listen to me!
I love you!

40:52.361 --> 40:55.061
And I don't care
that phillip's not my son!

40:55.063 --> 40:58.531
I will raise 100 children
with 100 of your lovers

40:58.533 --> 41:00.400
If it means
I can be with you!

41:01.736 --> 41:03.470
- Can you put that down?

41:03.472 --> 41:06.639
- This expresses how loudly
I love you!

41:06.641 --> 41:08.174
- [whispers]
it's too loud.

41:14.248 --> 41:16.216
- This is a ring

41:16.218 --> 41:18.685
Taken from the buttocks
of my grandmother,

41:18.687 --> 41:22.455
Put there by the gangster
patriarch of the coors dynasty,

41:22.457 --> 41:25.759
Melted in a foundry
run by mennonites.

41:25.761 --> 41:29.029
- Okay. Yes.
Yes, I will!

41:31.699 --> 41:33.767
- [gasps]
- I love you.

41:33.769 --> 41:36.469
- I love you!
[panting]

41:36.471 --> 41:39.305
- And I lied to you.
- What?

41:39.307 --> 41:41.341
- Phillip's your son.

41:41.343 --> 41:42.509
- What?
Why would you say that--

41:42.511 --> 41:45.145
- I just needed you
to want to marry me

41:45.147 --> 41:48.114
Because you wanted to
marry me.

41:48.116 --> 41:51.251
- Get out!

41:51.253 --> 41:53.286
I'm a dad!
- You're a dad!

41:53.288 --> 41:55.388
- [laughs]

41:58.359 --> 42:00.226
[overlapping chatter]

42:00.228 --> 42:02.228
- Hey, grab a seat.

42:02.230 --> 42:03.630
We have that table
and that table,

42:03.632 --> 42:06.733
But not that table
or that table or that table.

42:06.735 --> 42:08.368
Floor's up for grabs.

42:08.370 --> 42:10.370
Meredith has been
hogging the can.

42:11.272 --> 42:13.840
[kiss]
oh!

42:15.342 --> 42:16.643
- You have to change
the channel to pbs.

42:16.645 --> 42:18.711
- Yeah.
- College baseball is on.

42:18.713 --> 42:19.813
- But there's a documentary
coming up.

42:19.815 --> 42:21.247
Everyone in the bar
will love it.

42:21.249 --> 42:22.549
- What's it about?
- A paper company.

42:22.551 --> 42:23.683
- [laughs]

42:23.685 --> 42:25.752
- How many people
want the game?

42:25.754 --> 42:28.521
- Yeah!
- Yes!

42:28.523 --> 42:29.622
- Who wants pbs?

42:29.624 --> 42:32.192
- Whoo!
- Yes!

42:32.194 --> 42:34.561
- Sorry. A tie means
I do nothing.

42:34.563 --> 42:35.829
- Sir, please.

42:35.831 --> 42:38.364
This show is about me

42:38.366 --> 42:43.203
And my attempts to find love
in all the wrong places.

42:43.205 --> 42:44.237
- One more for the doc.

42:44.239 --> 42:46.339
- Hey!
[applause]

42:46.341 --> 42:48.641
[overlapping chatter]
- yay, andy!

42:48.643 --> 42:51.744
- All right.
- Yes!

42:51.746 --> 42:53.246
- Hey, how was
the singing show audition?

42:53.248 --> 42:58.184
- Oh. Eh, whatever.
No big deal.

42:58.186 --> 43:02.122
- Okay.
30 seconds to show time.

43:02.124 --> 43:03.823
- I feel scared a little.

43:03.825 --> 43:05.758
- Yeah, I'm not ready
for this.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.727
- No one is ready for this.
You can't be ready for this.

43:07.729 --> 43:09.329
We don't even know
what this is.

43:09.331 --> 43:13.333
- One thing we do know.
Nothing will ever be the same.

43:13.335 --> 43:15.235
- Here we go.

43:15.237 --> 43:17.203
[upbeat music]

43:17.205 --> 43:20.840
- All right, jim,
your quarterlies look very good.

43:20.842 --> 43:22.408
How are things going
at the library?

43:22.410 --> 43:24.477
- Oh, I told you.
I couldn't close it, so--

43:24.479 --> 43:27.714
- So, you've come
to the master for guidance?

43:27.716 --> 43:29.716
Is this what you're saying,
grasshopper?

43:29.718 --> 43:31.651
- Uh, actually,
you called me in here.

43:31.653 --> 43:34.521
- All right. Well, let me
show you how it's done.
