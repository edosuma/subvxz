Chantay:
Hello?

00:17.918 --> 00:19.520
Hello?

00:21.755 --> 00:23.124
Avon:
Who was that?

00:23.224 --> 00:25.393
They hung up
without saying.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.028
They hung up
without saying?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.968
Chantay:
What you care?

00:35.069 --> 00:37.538
You never use the damn phone
in here no how.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.281
( pager beeps )

01:21.615 --> 01:23.351
Shit.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.420
What's up, baby?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.922
I need you to get
them phone lines
up out that house.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.192
Out the apartment?
Why?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.726
I'm saying,

01:32.826 --> 01:35.363
about not

01:36.797 --> 01:38.499
All right.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.368
Got you.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.603
Wee-Bey:
What's up, man,

01:42.703 --> 01:44.472
Good.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.274

01:46.374 --> 01:47.841

01:47.941 --> 01:49.177
Like we buggin'

01:49.277 --> 01:51.445
You know, like
we paranoid and shit.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.788
Naw, I don't wanna
use this phone.

02:00.888 --> 02:01.989
We used this
phone yesterday.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.491
Shh.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.626
What you blowing out
your mouth for, man?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.528
You act like ain't nobody

02:07.628 --> 02:09.630
Or got no
motherfucking enemies.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.665
Naw, man.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.335
We all right.

02:16.069 --> 02:19.873
( theme music playing )

02:22.176 --> 02:24.512
* If you walk
through the garden *

02:26.046 --> 02:28.682
* You better
watch your back *

02:30.083 --> 02:33.621
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

02:33.721 --> 02:36.257
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

02:37.725 --> 02:41.295
* If you walk
through Jesus *

02:41.395 --> 02:45.065
* He'll save your soul

02:45.165 --> 02:48.836
* You gotta
keep the devil *

02:48.936 --> 02:52.139
* Down in the hole

02:52.240 --> 02:55.909
* All the angels sing

02:56.009 --> 02:59.780
* About Jesus' mighty soul

02:59.880 --> 03:03.617
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

03:03.717 --> 03:07.321
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

03:07.421 --> 03:11.191
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

03:11.292 --> 03:15.128
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

03:15.229 --> 03:18.866
* You got to
keep the devil *

03:18.966 --> 03:22.503
* Way down in the hole

03:30.411 --> 03:32.980
* Way down in the hole

03:34.382 --> 03:36.484
* Way down in the hole

03:38.118 --> 03:41.555
* Way down in the hole

03:41.655 --> 03:44.725
* Way down in the hole.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.033
( dog barking )

03:53.133 --> 03:54.802
A'ight, this is
going to be so easy,

03:54.902 --> 03:57.170
them east side chumps
ain't nothing like
Avon's people.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.407
Watch, y'all
gonna see.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.343
A'ight, now y'all gonna
be here, all right?

04:02.443 --> 04:04.778
Hold up, hold up.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.547
Hey, yo, Boo!

04:06.647 --> 04:08.749
I'm gonna slide
up through here.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.752
Bailey, you gonna
cover the alley.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.986
Yo.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.423
( music playing
on headphones )

04:19.026 --> 04:20.361
Yo!

04:20.461 --> 04:22.330
Yo, Maurice short, man.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.664
- How short?
- Three.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.435
Tell him to grow
a couple of inches.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.407
Where you gonna be at?

04:35.242 --> 04:37.277
That be the trap,
right there, homes.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.848
You figure
they roll through
the alley for sure?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.452
Man, rats
always run to holes
in time of danger.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.520
Brandon:
And you him,
ain't you?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.022
- Omar: Who?
- Danger.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.092
Naw, man,
I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.261
And a shotgun.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.296
Omar:
For sure.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.767
Sorry I'm late.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.003
Got myself lost
down the other hallway.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.339
That leads
to the loading dock.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.708
Yeah, and deep storage.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.210
- So, this is
where they put you?
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.679
Quite a message
they're sending.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.113
Yeah, and that
message is...

05:13.213 --> 05:14.382
"Out of sight,
out of mind."

05:14.482 --> 05:16.684
Spoken like
a true troglodyte.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.356
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.824
The foundation
of your case,
detective.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.393
You lay it
in right, you
can build on it.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.627
You lay it wrong,

05:26.727 --> 05:29.463
everything
on top falls.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.999
- We ready?
- Um-hmm.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.934
Do you solemnly
swear and affirm

05:34.034 --> 05:35.335
that the
affidavit is true

05:35.436 --> 05:36.537
and accurate to the
best of your knowledge?

05:36.637 --> 05:38.138
- I do.
- I do.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.008
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.

05:42.910 --> 05:43.844
Did he swear already?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.847
- The state's attorney?
- Yeah. I see it.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.149
Second copy is
sealed for the court

05:49.249 --> 05:50.718
and the police
get the others.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.252
How's this work?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.255
Same frequency as
the one carried by
D'Angelo Barksdale.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.625
He's gets a page,
we get a page.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.826
Ah.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.293
So, we up now?

06:00.394 --> 06:03.163
It's official.
You're up.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.032
Then let the game begin.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.800
( pager beeping )

06:09.770 --> 06:12.172
Phalen:
Celebrities always
seem much smaller

06:12.272 --> 06:14.141
when you meet them
in person.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.746
( whistling
"The Farmer in the Dell" )

06:23.150 --> 06:25.318
Yo, yo!

06:25.419 --> 06:27.087
Hey, yo!

06:28.822 --> 06:31.224
Check it out,
here he come.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.993
Somethin'
ain't right, yo.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.195
Man:
Watch out, man,
here come that fool.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.797
He's packing.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.231
Here he come.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.968
Yo, yo, come on.
Omar's coming, man!

06:41.068 --> 06:43.471
Oh, shit!

06:53.313 --> 06:55.983
( continues whistling )

07:04.191 --> 07:07.094
Mm, yeah,

07:07.194 --> 07:10.163
the cheese
stands alone.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.233
How you know?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.735
'Cause if you could,
I'd have been had.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.205
Yo, he sayin'
you can't catch
the bug

07:18.305 --> 07:19.907
just by getting
yo' dick sucked.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.777
Dumbass, you gotta
be in some pussy t
o get it, all right?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.646
Man, wear a coat
if you want,

07:25.746 --> 07:27.681
don't nobody like
suckin' on a rubber.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.918
- How would you know?
- ( laughing )

07:34.755 --> 07:37.491
Who you trying
to fuck anyway?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.860
Arletta Mouzone.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.361
Treenee's cousin.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.296
Damn, man,
in that case

07:43.396 --> 07:45.365
use a big-ass
condom, all right?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.300
Use a trash bag.
Fuck that.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.604
I wouldn't run up
in that bitch with
D'Angelo's dick.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.058
Ahh!

08:11.158 --> 08:14.061
Easy to see why niggers coming
around here stealing our shit!

08:15.563 --> 08:17.598
Yo, you know what?
You know what, nigger?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.901
- What?
- ( pager beeping )

08:26.640 --> 08:28.008
Forget it.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.912
( computer beeping )

08:32.011 --> 08:35.148
Freamon:
One-four-two isn't a working
telephone exchange.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.085
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't
working numbers?

08:39.385 --> 08:40.688
Something wrong
with the recorder?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.422
We're getting
what you'd expect,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.124
seven digits of
a telephone number

08:44.224 --> 08:46.860
and a two-digit add-on
to identify the caller,

08:46.960 --> 08:50.197
- like here, 13.
- McNulty, line one.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.700
All right.
Yeah.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.401
McNulty:
Did you just get
a one-four-two exchange?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.069
Freamon:
Yep, that's what
we got too.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.270
McNulty:
It's fucked up.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.739
Freamon:
All right, later.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.844
He's got the same
numbers on the readout
of the cloned pagers.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.545
So, it's not the recorder.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.380
These mopes are using a
code to cover their calls?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.749
Uh-huh.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.150
That's pretty
damn sophisticated.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.819
What is?

09:11.919 --> 09:14.454
Well, they've coded
the telephone numbers

09:14.554 --> 09:15.856
in their pager messages.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.591
How you know?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.492
Every time the
Barksdale kid's
pager goes off,

09:19.593 --> 09:21.394
this machine gives us
a message and time.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.796
McNulty's carrying
a cloned pager,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.197
but this is what
we use in court.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.766
Same with those
pin registers.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.500
Every time someone
uses either

09:27.601 --> 09:29.369
the pay phones
in the low-rise court,

09:29.469 --> 09:30.938
we get the telephone
number,

09:31.038 --> 09:33.006
the time and the duration
of the call.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.407
Incoming calls too.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.577
Spy shit. Very cool.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.680
You say they're using
some kind of code?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.048
Yeah, they got to be.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.183
These numbers don't
make no fucking sense.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.690
You rang?

09:49.790 --> 09:52.392
Omar's ride.
Bubbles spotted it.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.527
Different tags,
no stolen report,

09:54.628 --> 09:56.063
these come back
right for the van,

09:56.163 --> 09:58.431
but Bubs makes it by the
cargo rack on the roof.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.100
Good scope.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.169
You wanna take him?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.436
Can't hurt to try.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.605
We pop Omar,
get a gun...

10:05.706 --> 10:07.407
he might let
us work him.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.643
Anything coming through
on the pager?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.846
Eight hits so far,

10:12.946 --> 10:16.316
most of them
in some kinda code.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.820
These ain't Baltimore
exchanges, that's for sure.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.822
Three weeks to get
Daniels to agree,

10:21.922 --> 10:23.223
a week to write out
the affidavit,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.092
and then
this bullshit.

10:25.192 --> 10:29.496
How complex a code can
it be if these knuckleheads
are usin' it?

10:29.596 --> 10:32.399
Then again, what's
it say about us if
we can't break it?

10:34.367 --> 10:35.836
You wanna run Bubs
back downtown,

10:35.936 --> 10:37.370
I'll sit here
and wait for you.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.406
All right.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.377
What I miss,
girlfriend?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.213
Not a goddamn thing.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.381
Yeah, boring,
ain't we?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.885
How y'all do
what you do every day
and not wanna get high?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.321
That's what
I be askin'.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.264
It's been a little hectic
down here, right, cuz?

11:04.364 --> 11:07.067
String, man, I can't lie.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.669
Them stickup
boys they caught
us dead up.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.739
And the knockers--

11:11.839 --> 11:13.907
shit, I don't know
what the fuck that was.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.476
Boy: Five-O.
Five-O, coming up.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.211
Five-O,
coming up, y'all.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.479
Woman:
Time-out.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.314
Bell:
C'mon, man, what is that?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.682
Dee:
What?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.217
You gotta get
your crew to
understand that

11:24.317 --> 11:26.586
it's the stick-up
crews and the creepers

11:26.686 --> 11:28.088
that be giving us
the most trouble.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.990
As soon as they start
thinking like that,

11:30.090 --> 11:31.992
you're not gonna have anymore
surprises, you feel me?

11:32.092 --> 11:35.128
'Cause you know,
your uncle and me,

11:35.228 --> 11:37.630
we think you got
a snitch up in the shop.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.599
- ( beeper beeps )
- What?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.035
Someone who
tips off the
stick-up crew.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.504
And you gotta
be on that, right?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.439
You gotta
be on that.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.108
I'm gonna tell you
what you do.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.311
What day is it
today, Friday?

11:51.411 --> 11:52.980
What happen
on Friday?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.514
Payday.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.316
- Not this Friday.
- Why not?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.218
No, no, what you gonna do
is you gonna call them

11:58.318 --> 12:01.488
like you gonna
pay them and then
you crack 'em.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.856
You tell 'em you're
not happy

12:02.956 --> 12:05.025
with what
they fucking pass
as work down here.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.195
And when you not happy,
they ain't getting paid.
You feel me?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.830
Yeah, but String, man,
you don't pay a nigger,

12:09.930 --> 12:11.631
he ain't gonna
work for you.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.634
What you think a nigger's
gonna get a job?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.037
You think these
niggers gonna be
like fuck it,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.539
let me quit this
game here and go
to college?

12:19.639 --> 12:23.676
Naw, man, they gonna
buck a little, but they
not gonna walk.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.980
And in the end,
you gonna get respect.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.115
Yeah.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.017
And when that
money run out,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.484
they'll come up to
you and roll on you

12:31.584 --> 12:33.887
and ask you for an advance
and shit,

12:33.987 --> 12:36.389
when they flat-ass broke.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.692
Them the niggers that
you strike off your list.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.762
But that nigger
that stay-eating,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.531
the nigger that
steady-rollin',

12:44.631 --> 12:46.766
ain't asking
you for shit...

12:46.867 --> 12:49.369
that's the nigger
I want to hear about.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.471
Understand?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.975
Yeah, man, shit, you know
how to play a nigger

12:55.075 --> 12:56.844
into a corner, String.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.645
Yo, take care
of this right here.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.080
You my favorite girl.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.083
Shit, let me
handle this, man.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.453
Hey, yo, Poot.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.288
- Yeah, I--
- Come here, man.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.489
What's happening?

13:09.589 --> 13:10.690
What the fuck
is that?

13:10.790 --> 13:11.892
What the fuck is that?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.560
You know
the fucking rules.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.109
( copy machine whirring )

13:38.618 --> 13:40.220
What the fuck
are you doin'?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.522
Copying.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.193
A telephone?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.829
This fucking detail
is too much.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.340
Greggs:
It's after 3:00.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.142
So, where
the boys at?

14:02.242 --> 14:05.278
Maybe they only
come out at night.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.782
McNulty:
I used to have a guy
like Omar working for me.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.752
Guy named Reuben Terry.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.254
Is he good?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.856
Saw the street
like we wish we could.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.593
Ain't nothing
like a good CI.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.365
School's out.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.534
Greggs:
Hmm.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.236
Can I use your cell phone?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.907
( dialing )

14:38.845 --> 14:40.914
( knocks )

14:43.383 --> 14:45.218
Yeah, I got that.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.287
I did.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.989
Mm-hmm.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.259
I know.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.362
You don't know-- what do you
mean, you don't know?

14:55.462 --> 14:57.897
For Christ sakes, Elena,
I'm their father.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.733
You think I'd let 'em
sleep on the floor?

15:00.833 --> 15:03.370
Yes, I got them.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.006
Sheets, pillows,
comforters, pillowcases.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.041
I fucking got them.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.377
Color, what the fuck do you
care what color they are?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.479
Hello?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.286
Lost her.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.720
I bet.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.989
You know something?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.923
My ex-wife, the way
she acts sometimes,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.093
the way she deals
with shit...

15:27.827 --> 15:29.729
you would think--

15:29.829 --> 15:31.631
a less enlightened
man than myself,

15:31.731 --> 15:33.400
cruder man
than myself,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.202
a man less sensitized
to the qualities

15:35.302 --> 15:36.836
and charms
and value of women,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.871
a man like that, not me,
but a man like that,

15:38.972 --> 15:41.041
he just might
call her a cunt.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.077
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.512
No, I did not
call her the--

15:45.612 --> 15:48.015
- Yes, you fucking did.
- No, I did not!

15:48.115 --> 15:50.117
Let's just leave this, okay?
I got some stuff to do.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.425
Man:
Five-O, running low,
yo, man, get out there.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.101
Not much
fighting this time.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.702
You getting
tired, asshole?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.904
Still draggin'
from the whuppin'
Kima put on him.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.773
Fucked you up like
a cop should, didn't she?

16:13.873 --> 16:15.142
That's one thing
about Kima,

16:15.242 --> 16:17.977
she put a hurtin'
on you like a man.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.114
Get your
monkey ass up.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.685
You're gonna want your
business card back, right?

16:25.785 --> 16:28.155
Come on.

16:33.526 --> 16:37.164
( McNulty singing )
* From Bantry Bay
to the Derry Cay *

16:37.264 --> 16:40.767
* From Galway
to Dublin Town *

16:40.867 --> 16:44.671
* Well, I've never seen

16:44.771 --> 16:46.773
* My brown Colleen

16:46.873 --> 16:50.677
* Like County Down

16:50.777 --> 16:53.446
( humming )

17:03.156 --> 17:06.059
* There's a man in
the County Down... *

17:06.159 --> 17:08.027
First I go
in, play nice.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.695
Then you come
in, play bad.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.299
I ain't gonna
be playing.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.615
Bracelet too tight?

17:44.831 --> 17:47.200
You rackin' up all
kinds of points, ain't you?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.102
First, you put a cop
in the hospital,

17:49.202 --> 17:51.571
damn near kill his ass
with that punch.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.174
Now, you on the wing
from Boys' Village.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.976
Man, I'm 16,
all right?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.311
What the fuck
they gonna do to me?

17:58.411 --> 18:01.648
That's the least of
your worries, my friend.

18:01.748 --> 18:06.052
I got a partner outside
who can't wait to get in
here and fuck you up.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.589
Cop you banged
was Herc's uncle.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.891
Herc wants off the leash
on this one.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.327
And, uh,

18:14.427 --> 18:17.464
I suppose you at the other
end of that leash, huh?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.536
See,

18:23.636 --> 18:26.473
I don't want
to play it that way.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.109
I know about comin' up
hard and all.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.646
Why, you...

18:33.746 --> 18:35.215
you came up hard?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.016
Flag House projects.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.818
Eastside.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.322
Yeah, Flag House?

18:46.058 --> 18:48.528
You know,
you remind me of me.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.466
I'm thinkin'

18:53.566 --> 18:55.835
we should work
somethin' out.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.173
What do I get?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.747
What you want?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.757
I want...

19:19.058 --> 19:21.194
for you
to suck my dick.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.170
I'll beat your fucking
monkey ass.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.439
Come on, take it easy.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.106
You supposed
to be the good cop.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.210
- Dumb motherfucker.
- Herc: What, what?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.788
Hello, may I help you?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.257
Yeah, we'd like
a table.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.924
And you have
reservations?

19:53.593 --> 19:56.263
Naw, I thought,
you know, we could
just walk in.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.565
Let me see what I got.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.601
That's two?

20:06.172 --> 20:07.740
Well, follow me, please.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.819
Your coat, ma'am?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.423
Uh, can we get that one
over there?

20:23.523 --> 20:24.824
Ah, it's Friday night,

20:24.924 --> 20:26.959
those are for patrons
who made reservations.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.728
Let me get your chair
for you, ma'am.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.900
It's okay, man.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.203
Here you are.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.406
Here you are, sir.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
Your waiter will
be with you shortly.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.548
You should of
pushed him, Dee.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.972
Oh, bastards.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.925
Sarge, nobody answers
at juvenile intake

21:33.025 --> 21:34.561
and we've been callin'.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.763
Well, clearly, they're
not as dedicated as
you two detectives.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.367
So, what time does
the duty intake
consultant get here?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.634
You missed
the 8:00.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.570
You got another one
around midnight.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.906
Midnight?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.875
You think maybe
if we left you
the paperwork,

21:48.975 --> 21:50.977
you could put him
in the box till
intake gets here?

21:51.077 --> 21:53.780
( phone rings )

22:04.391 --> 22:06.092
Hemorrhoid.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.709
For the crumbs.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.911
Yeah, right.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.418
- You like
your dinner?
- Yeah.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.685
That shrimp
was right.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.687
Yeah, it was
good, right?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.122
Mm-hmm.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.029
Think they know?

22:43.129 --> 22:45.297
Do they know what?

22:45.398 --> 22:46.499
You know.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.134
What I'm about.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.403
What you mean, Dee?

22:51.804 --> 22:54.641
Come on, you know,
it's like,

22:54.741 --> 22:56.576
we get all
dressed up, right?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.578
Come all the way
across town.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.713
Fancy place
like this.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.815
After we finished, we gonna
go down to the harbor.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.517
Walk around a little bit,
you know?

23:04.617 --> 23:06.318
Acting like we belong down here,
know what I'm saying?

23:06.419 --> 23:08.287
So?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.623
Your money
good, right?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.726
Dee, we ain't the only
black people in here.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.728
It ain't about that.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.129
It ain't what
I'm talkin' about.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.931
It's about where we...

23:19.031 --> 23:20.166
come on, you know.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.368
I'm just saying,
you know,

23:22.469 --> 23:24.904
I feel like some shit
just stay with you.

23:25.004 --> 23:28.475
You know what I'm saying?
Like, hard as you try,

23:28.575 --> 23:30.409
you still can't go nowhere,
you know what I'm saying?

23:30.510 --> 23:32.144
Can I interest you
in dessert?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.681
Uh, yes,
thank you.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.116
Can I have some
chocolate cake?

23:37.216 --> 23:38.951
I'll bring the cart.

23:42.388 --> 23:45.492
Boy, don't nobody
give a damn about
you and your story.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.360
You got money, you get to
be whatever you say you are.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.162
That's the way it is.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.003
Oh, sir, I'm sorry.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.138
These are
the samples.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.246
And for you, sir?

24:07.346 --> 24:08.915
Very good.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.492
Herc:
Don't be a bitch,
admit it.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.529
Go ahead.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.365
Admit you're wrong,
be a man.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.668
Yeah, I gotta confess.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.804
This sub beats
chink-ass Bob's
by a mile.

24:31.904 --> 24:35.407
'Course, you might
be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers,

24:35.508 --> 24:38.144
but you can't do shit
with that stick, man.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.279
Oh, you do better.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.548
I play.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.215
Says he plays.

24:44.851 --> 24:45.885
He might.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.521
I'm even better
with two hands.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.859
Bell:
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.862
'Cept for that nigger
Scar from New York,

24:55.962 --> 24:58.230
Edmondson Gulley
is wide open.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.566
What about Tee-Tees' crew?

24:59.666 --> 25:00.800
Ah, naw, them niggers
dried up

25:00.900 --> 25:02.569
when they took
that federal charge.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.236
Most of 'em laid up
somewhere, gettin'
high and shit.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.607
I'll tell you what.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.642
You holler at the boy Scar.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.544
Let him know, man, it's time
for him to take a stroll.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.379
If he give you
any beef at all,

25:13.479 --> 25:15.447
- we gonna put Wee-Bey
and Bird on it.
- All right.

25:15.548 --> 25:16.749
And then once
we got him outta there,

25:16.849 --> 25:18.417
we'll send in the smokers.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.720
They can run out all the little
poop butt locals and shit,

25:20.820 --> 25:23.723
or, if you think, it's some
cats in there who got game,

25:23.823 --> 25:25.257
then we put 'em
on our team.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.859
All right, who you want
to run it?

25:26.959 --> 25:29.095
- Send Stinkum up here.
- All right.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.298
He the one who saw the shot,
so, he gets a shot.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.709
All right, okay,

25:42.809 --> 25:44.076
not bad, not bad.

25:44.176 --> 25:47.179
Can't let the duty
officer see that.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.015
You wanna give it
a rest, man?

25:49.115 --> 25:50.082
You down 60.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.318
Pssht, that might be
your whole damn salary,

25:52.418 --> 25:53.753
but I clock
that shit in minutes.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.487
Rack 'em an'
break 'em, man.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.724
You the guys waiting
for juvenile intake?

25:57.824 --> 25:59.792
He's in the squad room.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.295
If I had more time,
I'd run you.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.897
Mm-hmm.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.634
Give you a tip,
Preston.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.535
You gonna
run a hustle,

26:09.636 --> 26:12.171
you best stay
with what you know.

26:12.271 --> 26:16.208
Hey, man, fuck you
and your tired-ass
advice, all right?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.113
But...

26:21.213 --> 26:24.016
that sammich
was good.

26:32.158 --> 26:35.227
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.730
Take the Gulley.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.933
What about, uh, Scar?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.136
Who?

26:44.236 --> 26:48.074
Listen, I'm givin' you
points on the package,

26:48.174 --> 26:51.577
so you make a go of it,
you hear me?

26:51.678 --> 26:53.079
You working
for yourself, too,

26:53.179 --> 26:56.082
so you gonna put out
the strong product.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.750
You gonna get
the locals behind it.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.085
It's as simple
as that.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.720
You get your team together,
you feel me?

27:01.988 --> 27:03.489
So go on and wait for me
downstairs.

27:03.589 --> 27:04.724
I'll be down
in a minute, man.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.326
We gonna make this money
run in a few.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.729
Smile or
something, nigger.

27:09.829 --> 27:10.963
Bell:
Whoo.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.999
Made that
nigger's night.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.534
Yeah, he
deserved it, though.
He deserved it.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.269
( pager beeps )

27:19.672 --> 27:21.708
Ah, it's Wee-Bey.
We got one.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.475
Oh, you think
it's Omar?

27:23.575 --> 27:26.979
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
It's one of the young'uns,
I think.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.580
Oh, one down,
two to go, right?

27:28.681 --> 27:30.416
Yeah, motherfuckers.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.852
Try to rob me, baby.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.155
( muffled music playing )

28:01.714 --> 28:03.682
( keypad beeps )

28:21.333 --> 28:23.970
One, two, three.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.299
A winner.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.401
Ah, a match?
Which case?

28:55.501 --> 28:56.969
The one you just
brought me, Bunk.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.704
Casing in that girl
shot up in Northeast.

28:58.805 --> 28:59.906
Kresson?

29:00.006 --> 29:01.673
Diedre Kresson,
right, yeah.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.542
She matches up
with two other cases,
both from last year.

29:03.642 --> 29:04.743
Which ones?

29:04.844 --> 29:06.545
Toreen...

29:06.645 --> 29:08.915
Boyle, some other
fucker named Ligget.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.483
- It's there in the report.
- Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.819
Yeah, them.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.354
Casings from all three
killings go to a .45,

29:15.454 --> 29:16.823
probably Colt Classic.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.826
Fuckin' Landsman,
how's he do it?

29:19.926 --> 29:21.593
You like Landsman
for these three?

29:21.693 --> 29:22.829
I don't know, Bunk.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.696
As sergeants go,
Jay's a sociopath and all,

29:24.797 --> 29:26.899
but I'd have to go with
an actual gangster.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.703
Hey, Jimmy,
you sittin' down?

29:31.804 --> 29:34.841
Man on TV:
I said it was hot, but if you
got these barbecue gloves.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.775
Bubbles:
You got a Johnny Weeks
up in here?

29:36.876 --> 29:38.777
- Who?
- Johnny Weeks.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.412
Over in the
game room.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.182
- Obliged.
- Any smokes?

29:43.282 --> 29:44.884
I'm out.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.019
Man:
You gotta give
the medication

29:47.119 --> 29:49.255
a chance to work
in your system, man.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.299
Hey.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.567
Brought you something.

30:01.667 --> 30:02.969
Hey.

30:03.069 --> 30:06.873
Yeah, some chicken pieces
and some fries.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.374
Bought you a
shake, but I...

30:08.474 --> 30:10.877
I dropped it
on the bus.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.083
It comes in a bag,
goes out in a bag.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.924
How long you
have that for?

30:27.459 --> 30:30.496
I fucked up, man.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.131
Yeah, I saw.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.533
There was nothin'
I could do, you know?

30:36.602 --> 30:40.406
It's like first
I got beat, right,
then I get this.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.642
( chuckles )

30:43.742 --> 30:46.245
What are these for, huh?

30:49.481 --> 30:50.616
They say I got the bug.

30:55.721 --> 30:56.889
The bug, huh?

30:56.989 --> 30:58.824
They checked me when
I was in the hospital--

30:58.925 --> 31:00.927
Are they sure?

31:09.835 --> 31:11.637
Where you been at?

31:13.139 --> 31:15.474
Here and there,
I'm at it.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.944
I'd have come past
sooner, but I been on
kind of like a mission.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.611
- A mission?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.014
Them hoppers
that beat you down,
they got problems now.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.216
Yeah, them and the people
that sling for 'em even.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.884
What?

31:27.053 --> 31:29.088
I put the police
on their ass.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.723
Police?

31:31.823 --> 31:33.359
What you get locked
up or something?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.794
No, come on.
No, I'm not workin' for 'em.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.163
I'm workin' with 'em.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.065
They don't give me
the badge soon enough,

31:39.165 --> 31:42.368
- I keep doin'
like I do.
- Why?

31:45.104 --> 31:46.705
What do you mean why?

31:46.805 --> 31:48.240
How you going to ask
me why?

31:48.340 --> 31:50.142
Why the fuck are you
in here, man,

31:50.242 --> 31:51.743
with all these fallin'-out
motherfuckers?

31:51.843 --> 31:54.413
Why you passin' shit
through a bag?

31:54.513 --> 31:56.382
Why they beat you down?

31:56.482 --> 31:59.051
Why I couldn't
do nothin' about it?

32:00.852 --> 32:02.888
It's all part of
the game, right?

32:02.989 --> 32:04.456
I mean,
you taught me that.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.972
What you up to
in here, man?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.475
Doin' the meetings.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.344
NA?

32:25.444 --> 32:26.545
Yeah.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.081
Twice a day.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.516
That's good,
man, that's good.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.884
It's good, Johnny.
Give the body comfort.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.520
Yeah.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.455
No, you needed
a change.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.991
Guess so.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.861
I'll be getting out of here
the end of the month.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.264
It's all right, man, you know,
they got meetings everywhere.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.133
You ain't gotta
worry about that.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.703
Bubs?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.042
Who's got the best
package now?

32:56.142 --> 32:58.177
Get the fuck
out of here, man.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.146
I'm comin'
home, right?

33:02.681 --> 33:05.751
A'ight, well, shit is weak
all over, you know?

33:05.851 --> 33:09.255
Got some boys
up at Baker and
Calhoun, though.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.656
They had a smoker out
the other day though.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.391
Yeah?

33:12.491 --> 33:14.026
Knocked a couple
niggers out.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.462
Ain't you a trip?

33:16.562 --> 33:18.464
Beat down, bagged up.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.199
Still ready
to rip and run, huh?

33:22.068 --> 33:24.536
I'm a Viking, homes.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.605
"I'm a Viking, homes."

33:33.712 --> 33:35.614
Hey, McNulty.

33:35.714 --> 33:39.218
There's something here
that needs kissing.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.488
Yeah, speak again,
oh, toothless one.

33:42.588 --> 33:46.024
I guess you know now
why I wear the stripes
in the family.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.693
A good call, Jay.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.128
'Course, if Keeley
hadn't fucked
the scene up,

33:49.228 --> 33:50.862
you'd a had that casing
months ago, right?

33:50.962 --> 33:53.565
Keeley. Let Keeley
be Keeley.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.502
We all can't be princes
of the city, now can we?

33:56.602 --> 33:57.869
Speaking of which...

33:57.969 --> 34:00.539
sit down.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.877
May I ask you a question
that is essential
to your career?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.113
What?

34:07.213 --> 34:08.647
Who do you serve?

34:08.746 --> 34:12.318
I am asking
you to identify,
for the record,

34:12.418 --> 34:13.819
your commanding
officer.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.353
- Major Rawls.
- Excellent.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.255
Now with that
thought in mind,

34:17.356 --> 34:19.658
I advise you to go
immediately into the
major's office,

34:19.757 --> 34:22.060
carrying the break
I've given you in
the Kresson case,

34:22.161 --> 34:23.895
and kiss
the man's ring.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.264
Because, Jimmy,
I have talked you right
out of the shithouse.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.933
- Yeah?
- Here's the deal.

34:28.033 --> 34:31.137
You wrap up
this thing with
narcotics in two weeks.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.139
You put yourself
back in the rotation

34:33.239 --> 34:35.107
when we go back
to night work.

34:35.206 --> 34:38.110
You do that
and you're back
in the fold.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.411
Thanks, Jay.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.114
No problem.

34:43.882 --> 34:44.983
Shit ain't right.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.186
You work,
you get paid.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.020
That's what
I'm sayin'.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.022
I'm gonna say somethin'
to him, a'ight?

34:51.123 --> 34:53.359
But, you should,
truth, truth.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.563
What's up, Dee?

34:57.663 --> 34:59.365
What's up, shorty?

35:03.202 --> 35:04.970
530, the count
is right, man.

35:05.070 --> 35:06.638
Good.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.907
Re-ups on the way down.

35:09.007 --> 35:11.210
Go tell Sterling
be ready for it.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.945
A'ight,
yo, Dee, man.

35:14.045 --> 35:16.482
You know, me and Poot,
we be steady workin'
it, you know?

35:16.582 --> 35:19.485
Nothin' sloppy,
no troubles, right?

35:19.585 --> 35:21.086
No.

35:21.187 --> 35:22.821
And we was wondering,

35:22.921 --> 35:26.057
if maybe you could let
a little something
go till payday?

35:26.158 --> 35:29.361
'Cause you know
right now, we some
broke-ass niggers, man.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.643
Right now, whoever
did our girl

35:44.743 --> 35:47.446
also did Boyd and
Leggett a month earlier.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.980
"Legg-ett."

35:49.080 --> 35:52.083
And those two are
definitely straight-up
drug executions.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.652
No mention of Dee
in either file.

35:53.752 --> 35:58.624
But, I did get a fresh
number on Tywanda.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.426
Who?

36:00.526 --> 36:01.927
- You know, the girl
who called in on Kresson.
- Oh, right.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.128
She put Dee
up for that.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.563
Have you seen this?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.267
Hey, Jaybird.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.901
Jay:
...and the bear said,

36:10.001 --> 36:12.771
you didn't really
come here to hunt
now, did you?

36:12.871 --> 36:14.406
( laughing )

36:15.607 --> 36:17.243
You see
Saturday's 24s?

36:17.343 --> 36:18.644
Sunday morning.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.479
Did you see
the one Worden got
on the west side?

36:20.579 --> 36:23.382
John Bailey in a
Kevlar vest lit up by
three separate shooters.

36:23.482 --> 36:26.352
Uh, Carey Street, yeah.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.387
Yes, you made the
connection with Kresson,

36:28.487 --> 36:29.988
you didn't think Bailey
might tie in with the
Barksdale crew?

36:30.088 --> 36:32.123
Worden's
on the other shift.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.892
I'm trying to work
my murders,

36:33.992 --> 36:35.527
Jesus Christ.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.996
Man:
Tony, line three.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.765
What took you so long?

36:39.865 --> 36:42.200
You might've heard,
we get a few murders
here in Baltimore.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.402
Sometimes we
just get backed-up.

36:43.502 --> 36:44.936
You weren't followed here?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.472
Why would
we be followed?

36:46.572 --> 36:49.741
Diedre was playing
with scary people.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.244
Who might
that be?

36:55.647 --> 36:57.683
You know,
you called this in

36:57.783 --> 36:59.518
after the murder
and you told
the detective

36:59.618 --> 37:01.887
that you talked to her
the night she was killed?

37:01.987 --> 37:03.722
Tywanda:
Yeah, she called.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.025
It was late.
She didn't talk long,
she said she had to go.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.494
Dee was at the door.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.228
And that was the last time
you spoke with her?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.831
Yeah, she was
killed that night.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.600
Dee was
her boyfriend?

37:14.700 --> 37:18.537
No, Dee was his
nephew or something.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.172
Dee would be
D'Angelo Barksdale?

37:21.273 --> 37:23.575
And the boyfriend,
Avon Barksdale?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.611
You know Avon?

37:25.711 --> 37:27.446
The question is
how do you know him?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.315
You out there running
the street with the players?

37:29.415 --> 37:32.518
I used to be,

37:32.618 --> 37:34.953
but not after this
thing with Diedre.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.722
I mean, damn.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.358
We used to go to O'Dell's
for ladies nights,

37:39.458 --> 37:42.561
and one time he was there
with all his people

37:42.661 --> 37:44.463
in one of those big booths,
ordering drinks,

37:44.563 --> 37:46.465
acting like he was
king of everything.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.800
And Diedre
ate that shit up.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.002
And you?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.738
I ain't gonna lie.

37:52.838 --> 37:56.475
I did the club thing
for a while, but...

37:57.343 --> 37:59.478
some of those places,

37:59.578 --> 38:01.847
everybody in there's
on some kinda game.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.549
But Diedre went with Avon?

38:03.649 --> 38:05.917
She was with Avon
for like a year...

38:06.017 --> 38:07.553
and something happened.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.821
Toward the end,
she started to get
real possessive

38:09.921 --> 38:12.023
and that didn't sit
with Avon, 'cause he
has other girls, too.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.060
Anyway, she started
bitchin' on him one minute,

38:15.160 --> 38:16.528
cryin' to him next minute,

38:16.628 --> 38:18.096
threatenin' to do
all kinds of things.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.398
She threatened
Avon Barksdale?

38:19.498 --> 38:21.567
Girl was
off the hook.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.835
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.171
A letter?

38:26.271 --> 38:28.139
A letter to
the state's attorney.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.176
Supposed to be some
sort of kin to her.

38:31.276 --> 38:33.779
She said that
if he dumped her,

38:33.879 --> 38:36.382
she was gonna
tell about the drugs.

38:36.482 --> 38:37.916
Did she write this letter?

38:38.016 --> 38:39.618
I don't know.

38:39.718 --> 38:41.653
I tried talking
to her about the
way she was acting,

38:41.753 --> 38:44.623
but she wouldn't
let it go.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.291
She even had it out
with him in his club
one night

38:46.392 --> 38:47.659
in front of all the people
that were there.

38:47.759 --> 38:51.430
- What, Avon has a club?
- Orlando's, a titty bar.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.932
- Does he own it?
- That's what Diedre said.

38:54.032 --> 38:57.102
She said he owned
a whole mess of stuff.

39:00.305 --> 39:03.341
( music playing )

39:13.018 --> 39:15.721
- Dee: Tell me
something, man.
- Orlando: What's that?

39:15.821 --> 39:19.825
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?

39:19.925 --> 39:21.159
Shit.

39:21.259 --> 39:22.628
You try dealin'
with all these bitches

39:22.728 --> 39:24.095
and they problems
for a few days.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.898
Get so you'd
rather be runnin'
a goddamn laundromat

39:26.998 --> 39:29.067
out this motherfucker.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.169
Heard you doin'
okay in the pit.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.271
Yeah, well.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.741
What, you ain't
gettin' it like that?

39:35.841 --> 39:38.777
Man, my uncle
still got me
working on salary.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.779
Damn, boy.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.914
You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.450
What?

39:44.550 --> 39:46.585
Come on, man, you
ain't makin' no ends?

39:46.685 --> 39:48.587
I know you getting
a little something
on this by now.

39:48.687 --> 39:51.389
No, man.
I'm just a front,

39:51.490 --> 39:53.692
clean name
for the liquor board.
I'm sayin'--

39:53.792 --> 39:55.661
- Man: What the fuck?
- Woman: Is there a problem?

39:55.761 --> 39:57.963
That was for the
drink before.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.831
Man:
It was for this one.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.600
I'm saying, it ain't
like I'm callin' your
uncle out or nothin',

40:01.700 --> 40:03.469
but damn,
give a nigger a chance.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.137
- Plenty of pie out
there for everybody.
- Believe.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.640
You heard Stinkum
gonna be comin' off
the clock, right?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.141
Gettin' a percentage.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.409
What?

40:11.510 --> 40:12.911
Gonna open up
fresh territory.

40:13.011 --> 40:16.748
Take over the corners down
near Edmondson and Brice.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.884
And my uncle
gave that to Stink?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.953
- Woman: Orlando.
- Figured you knew.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.590
Orlando!

40:24.690 --> 40:26.892
Excuse me, Orlando, can you
help me down here, please?

40:26.992 --> 40:28.694
Hey, I already paid
for that last drink.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.796
Well, that was
for the drink before.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.397
Hell, no,
that was for this one.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.332
Orlando: Hey, hey,
what's up here?

40:34.432 --> 40:36.502
Look, he ain't paid for
that drink and I took
$20 off the bar.

40:36.602 --> 40:39.004
Look she took 20,
then 20 more.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.071
Hell I did.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.273
Come on, now, why you
gonna do me like this?

40:42.373 --> 40:44.543
I been sittin' here with
you for an hour and a half
buyin' drinks.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.377
Look, man,
this ain't right.

40:46.478 --> 40:49.414
I just spent $120 in
drinks, $40 in tips.

40:49.515 --> 40:50.616
Now, you gonna
take all that

40:50.716 --> 40:52.484
and still try to sneak
into my pocket?

40:52.584 --> 40:54.052
- Shardene: I didn't take...
- Shit, girl.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.654
You got to go.
Get him the fuck
outta here.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.388
I ain't done so much
as touch your kneecap.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.791
Tryin' to treat her
with a little bit of respect

40:59.891 --> 41:01.893
and this is
the way you do me?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.029
Wait, wait!

41:10.235 --> 41:12.771
Okay, now I'm going.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.644
Why you do that?

41:20.512 --> 41:22.113
Did you
take his money?

41:22.213 --> 41:23.549
No, I didn't
take his money.

41:36.662 --> 41:37.996
You buyin' me
a drink?

41:39.598 --> 41:41.366
Can I see you sometime?

41:41.466 --> 41:44.035
Like, you know,
not in here.

41:52.210 --> 41:55.547
I don't usually see men
that I meet in here.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.023
Usually.

42:09.327 --> 42:13.565
Greggs:
What kinda strip joint has
a video camera looking out?

42:13.665 --> 42:16.467
More to it
than the girls, maybe.

42:16.568 --> 42:20.171
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse,

42:20.271 --> 42:22.841
he's got the apartment
building by Druid Hill Lake,

42:22.941 --> 42:24.743
he's got the
tow truck company.

42:24.843 --> 42:26.978
And that's just what
she knew from what
he bragged about

42:27.078 --> 42:29.147
to the dead girl.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.849
Major likes assets.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.684
The deputy, too,
I imagine.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.485
Nothing like a few
property forfeitures

42:34.586 --> 42:36.221
to swell the departmental
operation budget.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.824
Check city assessments
to see who owns the club.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.325
You get a company name,

42:40.425 --> 42:41.960
run it through the state
corporate charter office.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.562
Also, homicide picked up
one Saturday night.

42:44.663 --> 42:46.097
Might be one of ours.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.466
John Bailey,
he's a stick-up artist

42:48.566 --> 42:50.602
I used to know
from the Murphy Homes.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.771
He's found wearing Kevlar,
but it didn't help.

42:52.871 --> 42:55.440
39 casings on the scene
from three different guns.

42:55.540 --> 42:57.909
Overkill for
a burn bag,

42:58.009 --> 43:00.578
but about right if
he was running with Omar.

43:00.679 --> 43:02.247
Look it, our buddy.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.215
( pager beeping )

43:06.484 --> 43:08.153
( pager beeping )

43:15.026 --> 43:17.763
Greggs:
Just once, I wish they'd
use a right number.

43:23.168 --> 43:25.704
Omar:
Ain't like him to be late.

43:31.677 --> 43:35.213
Bailey's a fucking
dope fiend.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.148
I'm tellin' ya,

43:37.248 --> 43:38.884
them fuckin' people
ain't to be relied on.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.586
Hey, yo, why you always
gotta talk like that, man?

43:41.687 --> 43:44.890
- What?
- F-this and f-that.

43:45.757 --> 43:46.892
If I give it up,

43:46.992 --> 43:50.361
I lose half of
what I mean to say.

43:50.461 --> 43:54.099
Don't nobody want to hear
them dirty words, man.

43:55.433 --> 43:58.003
Especially coming from
such a beautiful mouth.

44:11.549 --> 44:13.752
Brandon:
Wait for Bailey?

44:15.420 --> 44:17.989
Early bird
catch the worm, dog.

44:24.229 --> 44:27.332
( baby crying )

44:27.432 --> 44:30.068
( dog barking )

44:38.710 --> 44:41.246
( music playing )

44:43.614 --> 44:46.351
- I beeped you.
- I didn't get it.

44:46.451 --> 44:47.819
Let me see.

44:47.919 --> 44:49.620
You want
to see my pager?

44:49.721 --> 44:51.890
Yeah.

44:51.990 --> 44:54.793
Sure, Prez, you want
to see my pager?

44:55.861 --> 44:57.195
I beeped you too.

44:57.295 --> 44:58.463
You all right, Prez?

44:58.563 --> 45:01.733
7-1-4-3-4-3-2?

45:02.600 --> 45:05.003
I got that.
That was you?

45:05.103 --> 45:06.271
You try it?

45:06.371 --> 45:07.773
Yeah, I tried it.

45:07.873 --> 45:10.108
Twice.
Non-working number.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.443
Would've worked
if you knew the code.

45:17.482 --> 45:20.285
Shit,
I'm as surprised as you.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.322
I like
word-search puzzles.

45:24.422 --> 45:27.225
You know, where you
gotta find the
hidden words?

45:27.325 --> 45:28.693
So, I thought

45:28.794 --> 45:31.729
I could do the
same thing with
the numbers.

45:32.730 --> 45:35.233
Take the number
I sent you.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.535
Now, take the seven

45:37.635 --> 45:39.337
and jump it over the five.

45:39.437 --> 45:40.538
You get three.

45:40.638 --> 45:42.273
Jump the one over the five,

45:42.373 --> 45:44.542
you get nine.

45:44.642 --> 45:46.912
With four
you get six.

45:47.012 --> 45:50.615
Three, that's seven,
four is six,

45:50.715 --> 45:52.583
a three again,

45:52.683 --> 45:55.686
and two is eight.

45:55.787 --> 45:57.789
Zero switches
with the five.

45:57.889 --> 45:59.690
So, seven, one, four,

45:59.791 --> 46:01.526
three, four, three, two

46:01.626 --> 46:03.995
is three, nine, six,

46:04.095 --> 46:06.264
seven, six,
seven, eight.

46:06.364 --> 46:08.033
Our number.

46:10.035 --> 46:11.469
And that's the code?

46:11.569 --> 46:13.071
Yeah, and it works

46:13.171 --> 46:16.241
because it's all about where
the buttons are on a phone.

46:16.341 --> 46:18.576
If it was a code
that involved math

46:18.676 --> 46:20.812
or algebra or whatever,

46:20.912 --> 46:22.047
these little
yo's in the projects

46:22.147 --> 46:24.615
wouldn't be
able to follow along.

46:24.715 --> 46:28.086
But with this, all you gotta
do is jump the five button.

46:28.186 --> 46:30.856
Ain't no math to it.
It's just...

46:30.956 --> 46:32.390
how a phone looks
when you look at it.

46:32.490 --> 46:35.560
Prez,
you little genius!

46:37.128 --> 46:38.063
Jesus.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.331
I could kill you,
that's so good.

46:43.368 --> 46:46.204
Your mother keep raggin'
at me to take him out of here

46:46.304 --> 46:47.805
and put him in
a private nursing home.

46:47.906 --> 46:50.008
Yeah, well,

46:50.108 --> 46:52.310
you know, she ain't
never gonna let that go.

46:52.410 --> 46:54.712
I keep telling her, man,
hey, we can't show

46:54.812 --> 46:55.981
this legit
money yet, man.

46:56.081 --> 46:57.715
Especially since he
ain't got no insurance.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.318
- ( pager beeping )
- Soon, though, soon.

47:00.418 --> 47:01.319
Yeah, well...

47:01.419 --> 47:04.555
So, you ain't big
on comin' here, right?

47:04.655 --> 47:06.357
Naw.

47:07.893 --> 47:09.360
Tell you somethin', man,

47:09.460 --> 47:11.129
you about to see your uncle,
you understand me?

47:11.229 --> 47:13.298
- This family.
- I know.

47:13.398 --> 47:15.433
Family is what count,
family is what it's about.

47:15.533 --> 47:18.870
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.272
( man screaming )

47:33.518 --> 47:34.886
Man.

47:43.361 --> 47:47.065
You never figured
on this, did you?

47:50.135 --> 47:51.769
Live the life,
lead the life.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.538
Ain't no big thing.

47:53.638 --> 47:56.041
He used to talk
that shit all the time
and he believed it,

47:56.141 --> 47:57.308
you know what
I'm sayin'?

47:57.408 --> 48:00.311
What's up, baby?
Talk that shit now.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.449
You know,
you're right.

48:04.549 --> 48:08.486
It's kinda hard to be
in here right now.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.121
He scare you,
don't he?

48:11.622 --> 48:12.958
You know,
I'm just sayin'...

48:13.058 --> 48:16.361
He scares me.

48:18.263 --> 48:20.898
Yeah.

48:20.999 --> 48:24.469
See, if he dead, you know,
I could carry it better.

48:24.569 --> 48:27.238
Comin' up the way we did,
you kinda expect that.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.775
You waitin' on it.

48:30.875 --> 48:32.978
See,

48:33.078 --> 48:35.981
the thing is, you only
got to fuck up once.

48:37.448 --> 48:40.651
Be a little slow,
be a little late,

48:40.751 --> 48:42.553
just once.

48:44.155 --> 48:47.325
And how you ain't gonna
never be slow,

48:47.425 --> 48:49.294
never be late?

48:50.962 --> 48:53.764
You can't plan for no shit
like this, man.

48:53.864 --> 48:55.933
It's life.

49:00.305 --> 49:01.639
Yeah.

49:05.443 --> 49:07.645
Scares me.

49:20.858 --> 49:23.028
Greggs:
They're still using it.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.996
I was by on Saturday night
and it was gone.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.398
On your own time?

49:29.034 --> 49:31.136
You still
gettin' your boys?

49:31.236 --> 49:34.339
Yeah, tonight
for a sleep-over.

49:34.439 --> 49:36.207
We're on.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.657
What the hell?

49:52.757 --> 49:54.659
Call for backup?

49:54.759 --> 49:56.361
Not yet.

49:56.461 --> 49:59.530
Let's see
how it plays out.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.384
An invitation.

50:19.484 --> 50:22.320
- Feel a little
lonesome for backup.
- Yeah, me, too.

50:24.089 --> 50:26.057
That's nice.

50:26.157 --> 50:28.359
- I'll check the van.
- I'll watch the boys.

50:39.737 --> 50:41.739
Afternoon,
gentlemen.

50:41.839 --> 50:44.575
Omar: Sayin' if you were
gonna use that you would've
been done using it by now.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.982
Greggs:
It's clean.

50:52.083 --> 50:53.418
Omar:
Got to keep it clean.

50:53.518 --> 50:56.121
Sayin' we having one of
our little parlays like this,

50:56.221 --> 50:57.922
got to keep it
clean, right?

50:58.022 --> 50:59.957
Omar with no gun
on the street?

51:00.057 --> 51:01.559
Must be
a first.

51:01.659 --> 51:04.262
Yeah, sometimes
who you are is enough, dog.

51:04.362 --> 51:06.764
But being as y'all
sitting on my ride so long,

51:06.864 --> 51:08.499
I thought I'd save
y'all some time.

51:08.599 --> 51:11.102
Come straight on out.
I ain't takin' no charge.

51:11.202 --> 51:12.437
And y'all ain't putting me
back up in no cage.

51:12.537 --> 51:14.939
We're not here
to bury you, Omar.

51:15.039 --> 51:17.708
We're pulling you
up because we got
a problem in common.

51:17.808 --> 51:19.610
- Problem?
- Barksdale.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.078
Naw, he ain't no problem.

51:21.179 --> 51:22.913
I don't know.

51:23.013 --> 51:24.615
Avon's been chalking up
a lot of bodies.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.217
And you being you...

51:26.317 --> 51:28.519
Put it that way, I guess
he could be a little problem,

51:28.619 --> 51:31.989
but, uh, I just can't really
come out and help y'all.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.024
You know what I mean?
Snitchin'?

51:34.125 --> 51:35.826
Just rubs me wrong.

51:35.926 --> 51:38.996
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.866
We respect that.

51:41.966 --> 51:44.935
If you do happen
to take a charge though,

51:45.035 --> 51:46.571
I'm McNulty,
that's Greggs.

51:46.671 --> 51:47.805
You give us a call,

51:47.905 --> 51:49.039
we'll sort
something out.

51:49.140 --> 51:51.142
Fair enough.

51:52.177 --> 51:53.444
You know, I used
to work the Homes

51:53.544 --> 51:56.847
back when your brother
was up there.

51:56.947 --> 52:01.219
You get a chance,
let him know they blew up
John Bailey last night.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.623
Good man.
Lot of enemies.

52:05.723 --> 52:08.359
Mm-hmm.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.928
I'm saying you trying
to catch up with Bird?

52:11.028 --> 52:14.064
Word is he dropped
a working man.

52:14.165 --> 52:16.301
Hey, wait, hold up.

52:16.401 --> 52:18.303
C'mon, don't play me.

52:18.403 --> 52:20.371
What working man,
what Bird?

52:20.471 --> 52:22.707
C'mon, now, ain't but one
working man, now is there?

52:22.807 --> 52:25.042
And Bird?

52:25.142 --> 52:27.945
I think your snitch
can handle that.

52:28.045 --> 52:30.181
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.

52:47.732 --> 52:49.200
( doorbell rings )

53:04.415 --> 53:06.817
( birds chirping )

53:12.490 --> 53:15.993
- ( knocking )
- You workin' late?

53:16.093 --> 53:17.795
- A little.
- Got a minute?

53:17.895 --> 53:19.964
Sure, have a seat.

53:20.064 --> 53:23.668
No, this is better
said standing up.

53:23.768 --> 53:26.070
You know, I've been
13 years on the shelf.

53:26.170 --> 53:29.173
I ain't bitched.
It was me that
put me there.

53:29.274 --> 53:33.344
But I'm here now,
and I gotta say a peace.

53:33.444 --> 53:35.913
We should've
had a tap

53:36.013 --> 53:38.283
on the project
pay phones by now.

53:38.383 --> 53:40.551
A wire there will
get us the drugs.

53:40.651 --> 53:43.354
Keep pushing, we'll get
a whiff of the money, too.

53:43.454 --> 53:46.657
Now, I know you're serious about
climbing that career ladder,

53:46.757 --> 53:49.694
and I know how slippery
it gets the higher you go,

53:49.794 --> 53:51.496
but for me,

53:51.596 --> 53:55.566
I don't want to go
to no dance unless
I can rub some tit.

53:56.434 --> 53:58.803
I appreciate your honesty.

54:00.305 --> 54:02.673
Goodnight,
Lieutenant.

54:26.731 --> 54:29.166
So, what you say
to make Dee pay out?

54:29.266 --> 54:32.337
I told him to give it up
or I'm gonna take it
out of the count.

54:32.437 --> 54:33.638
- Shit.
- Yo, look.

54:33.738 --> 54:36.874
I'll punk niggers
when I got to.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.445
Damn.

54:46.817 --> 54:48.719
- Hey, yo, that's him.
- That's who?

54:48.819 --> 54:50.455
One of the ones
that robbed us.

54:50.555 --> 54:52.457
That light-skinned boy.

54:54.024 --> 54:55.893
That's him?

54:55.993 --> 54:57.762
All right, c'mon.

55:03.668 --> 55:05.736
Brandon:
I'm the king of this shit.

55:20.951 --> 55:22.887
( phone ringing )

56:00.791 --> 56:02.092
Wallace:
So you want us to wait?

56:02.192 --> 56:03.428
Yeah.

56:03.528 --> 56:04.995
Wallace:
A'ight, we on him, man.

56:05.095 --> 56:06.431
All right.

56:13.504 --> 56:15.072
( computer beeps )

56:16.874 --> 56:19.009
( dog barking )

56:21.546 --> 56:23.180
There goes Scar
right there.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.982
Bird:
Right there
in the blue?

56:25.082 --> 56:26.216
Number 80?

56:26.316 --> 56:27.685
- Yup.
- I'm on him.

56:33.624 --> 56:35.426
( computer beeping )

56:43.133 --> 56:46.236
- ( pager beeps )
- All right, you got,
you got him?

56:46.336 --> 56:47.972
Hey, yo, find a phone
real quick.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.474
What's up?

56:49.574 --> 56:51.141
It look like my man Dee
got himself an emergency.

56:51.241 --> 56:53.177
What, he been
stuck up again?

56:53.277 --> 56:54.712
( laughing )

56:57.081 --> 56:58.649
( dog barking )

57:02.620 --> 57:03.888
( phone ringing )

57:03.988 --> 57:06.423
Bell:
Yo, what's up?
What you need?

57:06.524 --> 57:08.959
My people on one of Omar's
boys down the Greek's.

57:09.059 --> 57:11.028
Bell:
Oh, word?

57:11.128 --> 57:13.831
- All right, sit tight,
I'm gonna take care of it.
- All right.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.900
( computer beeps )

57:23.440 --> 57:25.375
Ain't nobody coming.

57:25.476 --> 57:27.311
Yo, Dee said wait.

57:27.411 --> 57:29.113
Dee said wait.

57:42.092 --> 57:43.794
Told you.

57:50.835 --> 57:52.537
Yo, he still
in there?

57:52.637 --> 57:54.839
Yeah, he in there
playin' the games.

57:54.939 --> 57:57.407
All right.
You sharp, son.
What's your name?

57:57.508 --> 58:00.077
- Wallace.
- Wallace? All right.

58:00.177 --> 58:03.213
This nigger

to us, all right?

58:19.096 --> 58:21.398
( phone ringing )

58:21.498 --> 58:23.400
- Yeah.
- Bell: Yo, it's done.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.135
Nice work, cuz.

58:25.235 --> 58:27.071

58:39.116 --> 58:42.052
( computer beeping )

58:50.561 --> 58:53.197
