WEBVTT

00:37.412 --> 00:39.039
Ahsoka...

00:40.290 --> 00:42.292
Tano, is it?

00:42.375 --> 00:45.837
I can't say yours is a name
familiar to me.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.881
Well, I know you.

00:49.716 --> 00:54.095
Yes, I imagine
we have several mutual friends.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.056
I wouldn't put it that way.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.308
Of course not.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.979
But I'm afraid your way of thinking
is behind the times.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.400
It's her. Come on! We'll trace the signal.

01:09.861 --> 01:14.491
I was certain that Kenobi
would have come himself.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.911
Perhaps bring his loyal foal.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.996
Skywalker, is it?

01:20.538 --> 01:23.917
Master Kenobi
had a more important engagement.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.919
Indeed.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.463
I wonder...

01:30.215 --> 01:32.842
The moment may be upon us.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.060
Why you?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.772
Why did Kenobi send you?

01:45.855 --> 01:49.859
Why don't you surrender,
and then we can both go and ask him?

01:49.943 --> 01:54.572
My surrendering,
well, that would be pointless.

01:54.656 --> 01:59.703
For if I am correct,
soon the Jedi and Republic

01:59.786 --> 02:03.707
will no longer be the controlling interest
in the galaxy.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.584
And who will be? You?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.336
No.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.089
Darth...

02:11.172 --> 02:12.590
Sidious.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.562
Not yet.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.069
Come on.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.467
We've lost them.

03:03.516 --> 03:07.228
There are a small number of firefights
still happening in sector 11.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.648
But for the most part, your clones
have been as effective as promised.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.444
Still, without Maul in custody,
this could all fall apart quickly.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.197
We must capture him before he escapes.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.201
He mentioned a name, Darth Sidious.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.163
Who is this Sidious?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.457
I do not know much,

03:27.540 --> 03:30.377
but I will share with you
what the Council suspects.

03:38.802 --> 03:42.389
Darth Sidious is the Sith Lord
who orchestrated the Clone Wars

03:42.472 --> 03:45.016
and played both sides of it
from the beginning.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.103
I first learned the name from Count Dooku,

03:48.186 --> 03:52.357
though any chance of learning more
about Sidious from Dooku has been lost.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.651
Why?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.404
Because Count Dooku is dead.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.906
Anakin killed him
while rescuing the Chancellor.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.658
With Dooku gone,

04:01.741 --> 04:05.453
we've lost a vital link to understanding
the mystery of Darth Sidious.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.997
If you can capture Maul,

04:08.081 --> 04:11.084
he may be able to provide
the missing pieces to this puzzle.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.211
Then send me more men.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.547
Unfortunately, I cannot.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.800
I'm being sent to hunt down
General Grievous on Utapau.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.429
What about Anakin?
Maybe he can reinforce us?

04:25.056 --> 04:28.351
May I speak to Ahsoka alone for a moment?

04:40.321 --> 04:43.658
Anakin is on a special assignment
by order of the Jedi Council.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.244
What kind of assignment?

04:46.911 --> 04:50.665
He has been instructed to observe
the Chancellor and report his findings.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.877
Observe? You mean spy.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.673
They told him to spy
on the Supreme Chancellor? Why?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.802
The Senate has allowed
the Supreme Chancellor to remain in office

05:02.886 --> 05:05.221
long after his term has expired.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.559
The Council wants to know
what his true intentions are.

05:10.852 --> 05:14.981
The Chancellor has been a great friend
and mentor to Anakin.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.859
I can't imagine he is happy about this.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.070
No. He is not.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.281
So perhaps it's best
that you do speak with him.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.407
And what?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.618
Defend the Council's actions?

05:26.701 --> 05:29.329
I hardly think
I'm the best person for that.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.626
Ahsoka, the Council isn't always right.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.337
That's why I'm asking for your help.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.922
Sorry to interrupt,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.085
but there's been an attack.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.509
You had best go.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.806
Tell Anakin...

05:49.015 --> 05:50.016
I will.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.125
We got ambushed on our way
to reinforce the entry port on C-deck.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.586
Rex,
make sure C-deck is properly fortified.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.754
Yes, ma'am.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.633
Commander.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.720
I'm here, Trooper. Sterling, isn't it?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.264
Yes. You need to know.

06:29.347 --> 06:35.020
Maul, he...
He went right through us, one by one.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.147
He was asking about you.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.526
The ARC Trooper, Jesse.

06:41.609 --> 06:46.114
Maul realized he was older, somehow,
looked in his mind...

06:47.073 --> 06:48.992
and he took him.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.161
He took Jesse alive!

06:57.083 --> 07:00.170
You're wasting your time.
I won't tell you anything.

07:01.087 --> 07:05.842
How charming that you actually believe
that statement to be true.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.974
Clones, bred for combat.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.018
All part of the plan.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.313
What plan? What are you talking about?

07:19.314 --> 07:24.069
The plan. The only plan that matters.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.405
Not even I was made aware
of its grand design,

07:28.156 --> 07:29.908
but I played my part.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.118
And do you know what happened to me?

07:32.994 --> 07:35.372
I was cast aside.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.083
I was forgotten.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.378
But I survived,

07:42.253 --> 07:45.340
and I can thrive in the chaos
that is to come.

07:46.174 --> 07:50.095
Saxon,
information is a valuable commodity.

07:50.178 --> 07:55.517
See to it that the Prime Minister
does not become an asset to our enemy.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.185
Yes, my lord.

07:59.771 --> 08:03.817
Now, there are some things I need to know,

08:04.401 --> 08:05.985
and you're going to help me.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.905
We can go round and round
in this circle if you want.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.449
I ain't telling you anything.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.661
It is not up to you.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.163
Your mind will speak,

08:18.039 --> 08:19.708
or it will break.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.382
Tell me.

08:27.757 --> 08:33.138
Who is this Ahsoka Tano?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.662
I'm flattered that you could find the time
to see me.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.165
What's Maul's plan?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.709
How is he going to escape?

09:04.377 --> 09:08.548
Maul is not trying to escape
because he sees no point in doing so.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.426
So, he believes he can defeat us?

09:12.344 --> 09:13.928
No, that's not it.

09:14.012 --> 09:18.183
For weeks now he's been consumed
by a strange sense of dread.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.935
Has he mentioned Sidious?

09:21.019 --> 09:23.188
Not that I can recall.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.775
You said he wanted Kenobi here. Why?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.778
Wasn't just Kenobi he wanted, no.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.530
Uh, there was someone else
he was interested in.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.574
Who?

09:34.657 --> 09:38.328
If only I could remember the name...

09:38.912 --> 09:40.580
Bo, help him remember.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.377
No, wait. It was...

09:48.880 --> 09:50.048
Saxon.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.301
Rex, get a medic!

09:53.385 --> 09:55.470
This is Commander Rex.
We have a man down...

09:55.929 --> 09:59.307
Maul had a vision. A dream.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.185
The name came to him.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.603
What name?

10:05.397 --> 10:08.400
Skywalker.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.078
What's going on?

11:43.161 --> 11:46.081
Maul just told the syndicate leaders
to go into hiding.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.715
You once liberated me from my imprisonment

11:55.799 --> 12:00.011
by Sidious and his apprentice.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.806
At the time
I thought Dooku was an old fool.

12:02.889 --> 12:07.769
But now, now I see he and I are the same.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.313
One step behind.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.567
The dark side has never been stronger.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.279
My lord, what does it mean?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.117
Soon...

12:22.909 --> 12:26.913
the galaxy will be remade,

12:26.996 --> 12:32.752
and in the chaos,
we must seize what power we can.

12:32.836 --> 12:38.258
It is not the way of your people to hide,
here in the gutters.

12:38.842 --> 12:45.265
If you die, I promise you
it will be on the field of battle.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.935
And if you die...

12:50.061 --> 12:52.981
you will die as warriors.

13:04.159 --> 13:07.704
- That's it. Let's go! Watch it, watch it!
- We don't take orders from clones.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.748
You can't hurt us.
You need to leave.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.875
All citizens move to the shelter location.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.143
This occupation cannot last much longer.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.853
The people will not stand for it.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.397
I will not stand for it.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.149
You asked for our help.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.610
My men don't want to be acting
as a police force.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.615
The Republic forces will depart
once we capture Maul.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.826
Then you will have your opportunity
to lead.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.162
I agree.

14:00.215 --> 14:04.844
My lady, is that any way
to treat your rightful ruler?

14:13.687 --> 14:19.526
And now, as a show of good faith,
I return your comrade in arms to you.

14:24.614 --> 14:28.660
Run along. There you go.
Back to your brothers.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.497
Are you all right, Jesse?

14:32.580 --> 14:35.417
I'm sorry, Commander. I couldn't help it.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.961
I told him everything.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.254
It's okay.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.089
Rex, get him out of here.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.976
Uh, one of you
might want to deal with that.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.646
You should go. Your people need you.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.942
Don't stay on my account.
We'll be fine.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.737
Go.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.291
Watch out!

15:18.376 --> 15:19.461
Fire!

15:23.214 --> 15:28.386
Look at them.
So blissfully ignorant.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.514
Care to tell me what this is all about?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.059
Or would you rather save it
for the Council?

15:34.934 --> 15:39.064
Oh, no, no.
You are the one that I wish to speak with.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.902
Were you not cast out of your Order?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.279
I left voluntarily.

15:47.405 --> 15:54.204
Yes, but you were motivated to leave
by the hypocrisy of the Jedi Council.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.252
We were both
tools for greater powers.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.715
I am here to bring you to justice.

16:06.174 --> 16:10.637
Justice is merely the construct
of the current power base.

16:10.720 --> 16:15.892
A base, which, according to
my calculations, is about to change.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.103
And Darth Sidious is behind it?

16:18.520 --> 16:21.564
He is behind everything.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.483
In the shadows, always.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.193
But soon, very soon...

16:26.194 --> 16:28.947
he will reveal himself.

16:29.823 --> 16:35.412
With your help, the Jedi can stop Sidious
before it's too late.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.998
Too late for what? The Republic to fall?

16:39.082 --> 16:41.835
It already has, and you just can't see it!

16:41.918 --> 16:48.008
There is no justice, no law, no order,
except for the one that will replace it!

16:48.633 --> 16:54.014
The time of the Jedi has passed.
They cannot defeat Sidious.

16:55.598 --> 17:00.812
But, together, you and I can.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.652
Every choice you have made...

17:08.570 --> 17:11.698
has led you to this moment.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.448
I will help you.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.328
But you must answer one question.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.622
You have but to ask.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.542
What do you want with Anakin Skywalker?

18:05.835 --> 18:09.798
He is the key to everything.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.676
To bring balance to the Force?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.303
To destroy.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.890
He has long been groomed for his role,

18:19.599 --> 18:22.936
as my master's new apprentice.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.355
You lie.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.775
I'm afraid not.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.445
In fact, I was so certain of his fate

18:32.529 --> 18:38.243
that I orchestrated this war
to lure him here with Kenobi to kill him.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.330
Thus,
depriving Sidious of his prized pupil.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.710
I know Anakin.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.467
Your vision is flawed.

18:55.385 --> 19:00.056
I see the Padawan needs one last lesson.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.563
You're lucky Anakin didn't show up.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.941
The way you're fighting
you wouldn't have lasted long.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.736
Oh, you have Kenobi's arrogance.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.656
You'll find I have many qualities
for you to dislike.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.065
Move it! Move it!

20:45.203 --> 20:46.204
Come on!

21:09.185 --> 21:10.854
Lord Maul! I need backup.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.273
Our forces are falling.
We need your support.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.362
No. I think not.

21:19.446 --> 21:23.908
Any moment my ship will be arriving.
Die well, Mandalorian.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.577
No! Wait...

21:26.453 --> 21:27.912
Obi-Wan was right.

21:30.165 --> 21:31.791
You are difficult to kill.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.442
We could have destroyed Sidious!

21:57.525 --> 21:59.694
Only for you to take his place!

22:15.502 --> 22:17.837
Lord Maul,
we must depart immediately.

23:05.468 --> 23:06.928
Come on. Get the gunships.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.101
I give you one last chance.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.646
Join me... or die.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.481
Never.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.534
Let me go!

23:30.035 --> 23:31.202
Let me die!

23:37.459 --> 23:39.252
You're all going to burn!

23:39.336 --> 23:40.962
We're all going to die!

23:41.671 --> 23:43.173
You don't know what you're doing!

23:50.138 --> 23:52.057
We'll take it from here, Commander!
