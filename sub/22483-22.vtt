00:08.000 --> 00:11.083
(phone ringing)

00:11.166 --> 00:13.750
Aw. (chuckles)

00:13.834 --> 00:15.250
Oh.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.959
(yawning):
Hey.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.583
<i>Hey, birthday girl.</i>

00:24.667 --> 00:26.250
How's it feel to be 16?

00:26.333 --> 00:27.542
Oh, I must look terrible.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.000
I just woke up.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.375
Well, I made plans for us.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.375
Can I come over?

00:31.458 --> 00:33.375
(sighs) I wish,

00:31.458 --> 00:33.375
but I'm sure my parents

00:33.458 --> 00:35.083
already made plans

00:33.458 --> 00:35.083
for my birthday.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.166
They're so gay for me.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.375
Morning.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.625
There she is. Big day today.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.667
Oh, please don't make

00:40.709 --> 00:42.667
a big thing of it.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.208
Are you kidding? Come on!

00:44.291 --> 00:46.250
Battery recycling only

00:44.291 --> 00:46.250
comes once a year!

00:46.333 --> 00:48.166
Yeah. It's like Christmas,

00:48.250 --> 00:50.792
but instead of presents,

00:48.250 --> 00:50.792
you might get mercury poisoning.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.583
Tha-That's it?

00:52.667 --> 00:55.083
You don't have anything else

00:52.667 --> 00:55.083
to say to me?

00:55.166 --> 00:56.458
Yes.

00:56.542 --> 00:59.041
I need you to drag that

00:56.542 --> 00:59.041
duffel bag full of batteries

00:59.125 --> 01:00.709
down to the library. Okay?

01:00.792 --> 01:02.208
If it catches on fire

01:00.792 --> 01:02.208
on the way there,

01:02.291 --> 01:04.208
just throw it in someone

01:02.291 --> 01:04.208
else's garbage and run.

01:11.709 --> 01:13.458
(door closes)

01:13.542 --> 01:15.166
Okay, she's gone. She's gone.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.875
And she totally thinks

01:15.250 --> 01:17.875
that we forgot her birthday!

01:17.959 --> 01:19.792
-(chuckles)

01:17.959 --> 01:19.792
-Look what I saved.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.000
This is a drawing

01:21.083 --> 01:22.542
that Sam did

01:21.083 --> 01:22.542
when she was eight

01:22.625 --> 01:24.333
of her dream sweet 16 party.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.291
We are gonna bring

01:24.417 --> 01:27.291
this to life.

01:27.375 --> 01:28.917
Does it seem like

01:27.375 --> 01:28.917
a giant misfire

01:29.000 --> 01:31.333
to give a 16-year-old an

01:29.000 --> 01:31.333
eight-year-old's birthday party?

01:31.417 --> 01:32.959
Oh, Tyler. Don't be

01:31.417 --> 01:32.959
a dum-dum dummy.

01:33.041 --> 01:35.000
Listen, I know this is silly.

01:35.083 --> 01:38.125
I just... I want Sam to know

01:35.083 --> 01:38.125
that her dreams can come true.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.250
Yeah, before she's old enough

01:38.208 --> 01:40.250
to realize they don't,

01:40.333 --> 01:43.166
which usually happens

01:40.333 --> 01:43.166
sometime after college.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.083
Was that some sort

01:43.250 --> 01:45.083
of dig at me?

01:46.125 --> 01:49.000
(indistinct chatter)

01:50.458 --> 01:51.709
I'm Charlie.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.333
My mom left my dad,

01:53.417 --> 01:55.417
and now I live in this hotel.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.875
Hey.

02:01.959 --> 02:03.208
Looks like there's a

02:01.959 --> 02:03.208
few birthday surprises

02:03.291 --> 02:04.792
at the bottom of the pool.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.375
What? Nobody has ever dropped

02:04.875 --> 02:08.375
things into water for me.

02:08.458 --> 02:09.959
-(chuckles)

02:08.458 --> 02:09.959
-Aw.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.083
You think my dad's

02:14.500 --> 02:17.083
gonna come back?

02:21.125 --> 02:22.709
(chuckles) What are these?

02:22.792 --> 02:23.959
Open them.

02:25.583 --> 02:28.083
"I."

02:29.125 --> 02:31.083
"You."

02:31.166 --> 02:33.583
-I don't get it.
-CHARLIE: Mom! I found an egg

02:33.667 --> 02:36.083
with a necklace in it
that says "love."

02:36.166 --> 02:38.583
Hey! That belongs to her!

02:38.667 --> 02:40.291
Love?

02:41.417 --> 02:42.375
You love me?

02:42.458 --> 02:44.333
Are you really gonna
make me say it?

02:44.417 --> 02:47.834
Only if you want me
to say it back.

02:49.208 --> 02:50.709
I love you.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.083
I love you, too. (chuckles)

02:55.291 --> 02:56.834
I'm going after my necklace.

02:56.917 --> 02:59.625
Hey, turd! Get over here.

02:59.709 --> 03:00.792
Aah!

03:03.834 --> 03:07.083
Spoiler alert: these things
are full of newspapers.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.792
Candy costs extra.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.959
Yeah, but who doesn't want
to take a baseball bat

03:11.041 --> 03:12.792
to the news these days?

03:12.875 --> 03:14.500
I thought the only thing
that got smashed at these things

03:14.583 --> 03:15.792
was your dad.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.500
Oh, honey, can you believe this?

03:17.583 --> 03:19.083
Look it. We are giving our baby

03:19.166 --> 03:21.250
the sweet 16 of her dreams.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.458
Why do they call it
"sweet 16"?

03:23.542 --> 03:26.041
I did the most dirty,
horrible things when I was 16.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.542
(door closes)

03:27.625 --> 03:29.208
Hi! Sorry we're late.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.750
We had to take the bus.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.250
Uh, related: I am sorry
that I smell like pee.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.959
-Oh. Oh!
-(car door closes)

03:35.041 --> 03:36.875
Okay, that's Samantha. That is
definitely the car door slam

03:36.959 --> 03:38.583
of a teenage girl who thinks
her family forgot her birthday.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.208
Everybody over here. Okay.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.041
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Will you guys get the lights?

03:42.125 --> 03:44.125
-MATT: Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, she's gonna love this.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.458
My family's still not back.

03:46.542 --> 03:50.041
This morning, that would've
upset me, but now I'm glad.

03:50.125 --> 03:53.166
-Really?
-Today was so special,

03:53.250 --> 03:57.125
and I want to make it
more special, with you.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.834
What were you thinking?

03:58.917 --> 04:01.792
Let's go upstairs.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.208
I want you to be my first.
(chuckles)

04:04.291 --> 04:06.208
Samantha!

04:07.166 --> 04:08.208
First what?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.250
Surprise.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.709
-Surprise.
-Surprise.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.250
Oh, my God.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.000
-(door slams)
-I'm just gonna go...

04:19.083 --> 04:20.041
Nope!

04:20.125 --> 04:22.917
Okay. (clears throat)

04:29.875 --> 04:31.542
South America.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.000
It has mystery,
it's full of monkeys,

04:34.083 --> 04:36.208
and Loris can get us
a great deal.

04:36.291 --> 04:40.417
Or we can rent an RV
and drive around the country.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.875
We could shower at truck stops.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.458
You always wanted to do that.

04:43.542 --> 04:46.208
Oh, I hate for you
to find out this way, dear,

04:46.291 --> 04:47.917
but I've already done that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.208
Oh.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.875
John, I want a huge adventure.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.500
(whispers):
Let's get lost in the mystery

04:51.959 --> 04:55.500
of South America.

04:55.583 --> 04:58.291
WOMAN:
<i>Hola. ¿Cómo estás?</i>

04:55.583 --> 04:58.291
<i>Gracias por invitarme.</i>

04:58.375 --> 05:02.125
<i>Me llamo Lala y voy</i>
<i>a enseñarles español.</i>

05:02.208 --> 05:04.834
My name is Lala and I'm
here to teach you Spanish.

05:04.917 --> 05:07.083
It's so sexy.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.083
<i>¿Cómo te llamas?</i>

05:09.166 --> 05:14.458
<i>El llama e </i>Joan or Joanie.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.208
Excellent. Now you, John.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.333
What is your name?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.959
John.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.291
Okay.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.041
Please, Lala.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.250
Teach us everything we need
to survive our adventure.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.291
Yeah, yeah. Uh, ethnic food
doesn't always agree with us,

05:28.375 --> 05:31.834
so, uh, how do you say
"bathroom"?

05:31.917 --> 05:33.917
Bathroom is <i>baño.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:36.667
Say it with me. <i>Baño.</i>

05:36.750 --> 05:38.709
<i>Baño.</i>

05:38.792 --> 05:39.834
Now you, John.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.125
Bonbo.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.625
<i>Baño.</i>

05:43.709 --> 05:45.083
That's what I said.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.083
Good... enough.

05:47.166 --> 05:51.417
So, um, where is the bathroom?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.250
<i>¿Dónde está el baño?</i>

05:53.333 --> 05:59.000
Uh... (accented):
where is bonbo?

06:01.041 --> 06:05.750
Hi, uh, Mom needs the balloons
for Sam's birthday party.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.625
<i>No, en español.</i>

06:07.709 --> 06:10.291
We're studying for our <i>aventura.</i>

06:10.375 --> 06:11.333
-(chuckles)
-Sometimes if you just

06:11.417 --> 06:13.208
add flair it works.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.792
I haven't spoken Spanish
since high school.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.750
<i>Pero, </i>uh, <i>mi madre</i>
<i>necessita los globos</i>

06:18.834 --> 06:20.792
<i>para la fiesta de Sam.</i>

06:20.875 --> 06:24.792
Oh, my. Do all Spanish
speakers speak that fast?

06:24.875 --> 06:26.750
You know, Mom-Mom,
if you're having trouble,

06:26.834 --> 06:28.875
there are a few apps
you can get at the app store

06:28.959 --> 06:31.041
-that can translate for you.
-No, honey.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.208
I need to do things
the authentic way.

06:33.291 --> 06:36.166
That's why we buy our tortillas
from the lady in the wheelchair.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.875
She makes 'em with her feet.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.542
The best way to learn
a foreign language

06:41.625 --> 06:43.500
is to totally immerse ourselves.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.083
That's what Lala said

06:45.166 --> 06:47.583
when she canceled our next
six weeks of lessons.

06:47.667 --> 06:48.667
Oh.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.333
<i>Gracias.</i>

06:50.417 --> 06:51.709
<i>Hola.</i>

06:51.792 --> 06:52.875
<i>Bienvenidos.</i>

06:52.959 --> 06:54.750
Oh, I think he understood me.

06:54.834 --> 06:57.250
<i>¿Le gustará comprar</i>
<i>alguna de las frutas?</i>

06:57.333 --> 07:00.166
Uh... <i>¿Esos?</i>

07:00.250 --> 07:01.250
Ah, <i>manzanas.</i>

07:01.333 --> 07:03.291
Ah, <i>las manzanas.</i>

07:03.375 --> 07:04.333
<i>Sí, manzanas.</i>

07:04.417 --> 07:06.333
Yeah. I'm in a groove.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.709
-You get the piñatas
for Sam's birthday.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.709
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.750
Remember, Spanish only.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.458
Only Spanish. Yeah.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.500
Um. No...

07:14.583 --> 07:16.917
<i>¿Dónde est </i>were we? Uh...

07:17.000 --> 07:19.500
Lady,
just tell me what you want.

07:19.583 --> 07:23.583
Espanola, uh, <i>por favor.</i>

07:23.667 --> 07:25.250
<i>Quieres que te hablo</i>
<i>en español. Sí.</i>

07:25.333 --> 07:29.250
Have you any, uh, <i>Abuela </i>Smiths?

07:34.083 --> 07:35.250
<i>Hola.</i>

07:35.333 --> 07:37.041
<i>Hola, señor!</i>

07:37.125 --> 07:38.959
<i>-Hola.</i>
-(chuckles) <i>Hola.</i>

07:39.041 --> 07:41.375
<i>Una piñata, por favor.</i>

07:41.458 --> 07:42.500
<i>Ah, sí.</i>

07:42.583 --> 07:44.083
<i>¿Cuál quiere que le baje?</i>

07:44.166 --> 07:45.250
<i>Hola.</i>

07:45.333 --> 07:47.375
<i>Uh, uh, hola.</i>

07:47.458 --> 07:49.542
<i>Uh, ¿qué tipo?</i>

07:49.625 --> 07:50.792
John.

07:50.875 --> 07:51.917
One.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.375
(chuckles) John Juan.

07:53.458 --> 07:57.583
<i>Uh, ¿qué tipo de piñata?</i>

07:57.667 --> 07:59.500
Oh! Oh.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.709
My granddaughter is having
a <i>Princess and the Frog </i>party.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.208
You got any frogs?

08:04.291 --> 08:05.667
<i>¿Fro...?</i>

08:05.750 --> 08:07.125
Toads.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.166
Toad-os?

08:08.250 --> 08:10.166
<i>¿Todas?</i>

08:10.250 --> 08:12.000
<i>Sí, </i>toad-as. <i>Sí.</i>

08:12.083 --> 08:13.625
<i>No hay problema. Todas.</i>

08:13.709 --> 08:14.834
(laughs)

08:14.917 --> 08:17.083
(stammers)

08:17.166 --> 08:18.917
<i>Uno más, por favor.</i>

08:19.000 --> 08:20.250
Um, um...

08:20.333 --> 08:21.917
Uh... <i>Tiempo.</i>

08:22.000 --> 08:24.417
(stammers) <i>¿Tiempa?</i>

08:24.500 --> 08:26.000
<i>-¿Tiempo?</i>
-Joanie.

08:26.083 --> 08:29.208
Look what I got.
I learned a new word: <i>todos.</i>

08:29.291 --> 08:30.959
It means "everything."

08:31.041 --> 08:32.667
<i>-¿Todos?</i>
<i>-¿Todos?</i>

08:32.750 --> 08:34.625
<i>-Oh, sí. ¿Cómo no?</i>
-No.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.583
<i>-Todos...</i>
-No, no. No, n-no...

08:40.375 --> 08:41.917
That was awful.

08:42.041 --> 08:43.250
You know, I thought it was fun.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.709
I liked how tall I felt there.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.000
No, I don't know, John.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.458
How are we gonna survive
another country

08:49.542 --> 08:53.291
when we can't even survive
the farmers market in Burbank?

08:53.375 --> 08:55.000
Well, maybe Tyler was right.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.583
Maybe we should use
our cell phones

08:56.667 --> 08:59.583
to translate,
like everyone else.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.208
Yeah, but then we'd have
to learn

09:01.291 --> 09:03.250
how to use our cell phones.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.917
Well, I'm willing to do that.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.667
You know, it'd be an adventure,
just like you want.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.250
All right.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.333
Okay, let's do it.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.041
Let's join the millennials.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.000
Get your coat.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.709
We're going to the app store.

09:17.792 --> 09:20.291
21st century, here we come.

09:20.375 --> 09:23.542
Boy, I hope they take checks.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.458
What is the deal?

09:31.542 --> 09:34.750
How long does it take to put our
embryo in my sister's uterus?

09:34.834 --> 09:36.333
Well, if she parties like
the rest of your family,

09:36.417 --> 09:37.667
she was probably hard to sedate.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.333
Look at this convertible.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.208
Ooh. I love that.
Right?

09:41.291 --> 09:43.041
But there's no backseat
for our new baby.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.500
And you know I need
at least 20 cup holders.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.000
Hi.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.208
How'd it go? Is she pregnant?

09:49.291 --> 09:50.792
-She is.
-Oh, I knew it!

09:50.875 --> 09:52.333
No. I mean,

09:52.417 --> 09:54.709
Rita was already pregnant
when she came in today.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.625
-What?
-What?

09:56.709 --> 09:58.625
Yes, I am so sorry.

09:58.709 --> 09:59.792
Um, she's still in the back,

09:59.875 --> 10:01.583
trying to figure out
whose it is.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.291
You can see her if you want.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.166
I assume
she's in a fragile state

10:05.250 --> 10:07.291
and it would be wrong
to yell at her?

10:07.375 --> 10:08.333
Yes.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.583
Then, no,

10:09.667 --> 10:10.959
I shouldn't see her
right now.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.041
MATT:
It's just that Rita

10:12.125 --> 10:13.750
was the only surrogate
we could afford,

10:13.834 --> 10:15.917
because she was free
and she was down for whatever,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.291
which is probably how
we ended up in this situation.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.375
You know what?
I <i>am </i>gonna go yell at her.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.375
-It just feels like
something I should do.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.375
-Yeah.

10:24.917 --> 10:25.917
You might want
to close that door.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.083
COLLEEN:
Rita!

10:27.166 --> 10:28.792
Too late.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.667
Maybe we should
think about adoption.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.625
I don't know. I've just
heard so many stories

10:35.709 --> 10:37.667
of last-minute
disappointment.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.667
I don't think
my heart could take it.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.333
Ugh. Okay, maybe we should
just hit the pause button.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.875
Are you breaking up with me?

10:43.959 --> 10:45.583
What? No.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.291
No, I'm saying
let's just take a moment for us.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.709
-Oh.
-You know?

10:49.792 --> 10:51.750
Just really embrace the fact
that, for right now,

10:51.834 --> 10:53.500
it's just you and me

10:53.583 --> 10:54.792
and that we can use
our experience

10:54.875 --> 10:56.875
to help other couples
who are in the same position

10:56.959 --> 10:59.250
and really focus
and dedicate ourselves

10:59.333 --> 11:01.625
to philanthropy
and giving back.

11:01.709 --> 11:04.375
I have to have this car,
I don't care how much it costs.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.583
We're gonna look
so hot in it.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.458
-Fun, right?
-Yeah.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.959
Everyone wants one
of these babies.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.333
Ooh. (chuckles)

11:11.417 --> 11:12.500
Uh, it's just a car.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.417
Let's just call it a car.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
The fact is,
it's not "just a car,"

11:16.583 --> 11:19.208
because something like this
brings out the kid in us.

11:19.291 --> 11:20.583
And let's be honest,

11:20.667 --> 11:22.166
we've all got
a kid inside of us.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.375
Yeah, some people
don't need a kid

11:23.458 --> 11:24.875
inside of them to feel whole.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.458
-That's right.
-Excuse me.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.542
-I'm gonna go get
another doughnut.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.542
-Okay.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.417
You know what?
It's actually one per customer,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.667
but, uh, well,
that'll count as yours.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.333
Yeah, uh, hey, listen, man.
We're having some, um,

11:34.417 --> 11:36.792
baby trouble, so if you
could just dance around

11:36.875 --> 11:38.750
-any sensitive subjects.
-Yes.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.792
-Got it. Mum's the word. Oh.
-Ooh.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.417
-But I'll-I'll do better.
-Okay.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.750
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Have a seat.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.792
Thank you.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.792
Uhp.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.917
Uh...

11:51.000 --> 11:53.250
Ha. Yep. These,

11:53.333 --> 11:54.583
uh...

11:55.834 --> 11:58.875
The, uh, pictures
that come with the frames.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.041
But you're in that one.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.417
Hmm?

12:01.500 --> 12:05.709
Oh. Well,
I used to be a frame model.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.125
(chuckling)

12:07.208 --> 12:09.500
You guys came to the right
place, because this baby--

12:09.583 --> 12:10.583
I mean, car--

12:10.667 --> 12:13.917
goes zero to 60 in five seconds.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.208
-Wow.
-And the handling

12:15.291 --> 12:19.375
is as smooth as a...
full-grown adult's bottom,

12:19.458 --> 12:21.250
is what we like to say.

12:21.333 --> 12:25.709
So, uh, when do we
talk about financing?

12:25.792 --> 12:27.583
Yes, financing, absolutely.
Maria?

12:27.667 --> 12:29.917
-This is so exciting, right?
-I know it is. This really is.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.959
Time to talk numbers?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.667
Never mind.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.000
Hmm.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.875
(exhales)

12:35.959 --> 12:37.709
It's a gluten allergy. It's sad.

12:37.792 --> 12:38.750
Oh.

12:38.834 --> 12:39.959
(engine starts)

12:40.041 --> 12:42.166
-All right, we did it.
-Oh.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.125
Yeah.

12:45.208 --> 12:46.750
Here we go.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.709
Congratulations, you guys!
You're looking good.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.041
Can't let you leave, though,

12:50.125 --> 12:51.917
without a picture
for the website.

12:52.041 --> 12:54.625
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:57.417 --> 12:58.834
All right.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.208
Ho-ho, looking good.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.542
(camera phone clicks)

13:01.625 --> 13:02.667
I'll tell you what,
I think you got

13:02.750 --> 13:03.959
a really good deal on this car.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.375
And our policy is,

13:05.458 --> 13:07.250
if you find a better price
in nine months,

13:07.333 --> 13:08.792
th-then... ugh.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.208
Just...

13:10.291 --> 13:12.834
enjoy the car, and we'll see you
for your first service,

13:12.917 --> 13:17.500
which includes labor
and delivery-- oh, my God!

13:18.542 --> 13:21.667
(sighs)

13:22.667 --> 13:25.125
I wish we had a baby.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.750
I know. Me, too.

13:27.834 --> 13:29.458
You know what? What
are we doing here?

13:29.542 --> 13:34.083
This car isn't gonna make
us feel any better.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.917
You know what? We'll find
something that will.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.792
In the meantime, we're gonna
give back this stupid car,

13:39.875 --> 13:41.208
because unless you've
driven it off the lot,

13:41.291 --> 13:42.625
you don't have
to pay for it, okay?

13:42.709 --> 13:44.333
-Okay. I love...
-I love you so much.

13:44.417 --> 13:45.500
We're gonna be fine.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.959
We're gonna be just fine.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.417
(tires screeching)

13:48.500 --> 13:51.458
(alarm beeping)

13:52.875 --> 13:55.417
Well, technically, we
didn't drive it off the lot,

13:55.500 --> 13:58.125
so it's not really on us.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.750
GREG:
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

14:07.834 --> 14:10.250
I-I love you, too. Bye.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.542
Um, okay, that was Heather.

14:14.542 --> 14:16.250
Matt and Colleen
lost their surrogate.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.291
No.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.333
Yeah.

14:18.417 --> 14:19.750
Oh, that's so awful.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.333
-I feel so bad for them.
-Yeah.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.000
Ugh, and I'm sure the last thing
they want to hear

14:24.083 --> 14:25.041
is that I'm pregnant.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.458
Yeah. I mean, you know,

14:27.542 --> 14:29.458
Matt looks up to me so much
as a little brother.

14:29.542 --> 14:33.333
When he finds out how potent
I am, it will destroy him.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.709
-Yeah, that's gonna be
a tough blow.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.709
-Well...

14:36.792 --> 14:39.333
Okay, you know what, let's
just keep this a secret for now.

14:39.417 --> 14:43.542
Just... no one can know
that I'm having a baby.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.291
Mommy, you're having a baby?

14:48.375 --> 14:51.333
Um... Lark, honey,
what are you doing out of bed?

14:51.417 --> 14:54.583
Mommy, do you have
a baby in your tummy?

14:56.583 --> 15:00.000
You-- Come here, sweetie.
(sighs)

15:01.583 --> 15:03.166
-Yeah.
-(strained grunt)

15:03.250 --> 15:05.166
So, um, yes.

15:05.250 --> 15:08.250
Mommy has a baby in her tummy.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.667
-(laughs)
-Ooh! Isn't that exciting?

15:10.750 --> 15:13.625
You are gonna be a big sister.
Doesn't that sound like fun?

15:13.709 --> 15:15.417
No.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.333
But you don't think
it would be fun

15:17.417 --> 15:18.959
to have a-a brother or sister

15:19.041 --> 15:20.875
so you don't, you know,
end up weird?

15:20.959 --> 15:22.000
No.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.750
Wow, we're 0-for-2.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.083
Well, we've got some time
to warm up to the idea.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.000
-Mm-hmm.
-For now, honey, hey,

15:30.083 --> 15:31.291
let's just keep it a secret,
right?

15:31.375 --> 15:32.917
'Cause we have Sam's party.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.917
Oh, yeah. Do you know
what a secret is?

15:36.000 --> 15:39.917
Like when you forgot me in the
car and said not to tell Mommy.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.375
Ooh. Hi.

15:55.458 --> 15:58.709
-Hi. I heard the news.
-Huh?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.917
It's so exciting! Oh! Mwah!

16:01.000 --> 16:04.041
-No, Mom.
-I think she knows.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.583
Yeah. Okay, Mom, who told you?

16:06.667 --> 16:09.291
Lark. We were coloring together.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.667
It's a little disturbing.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.458
It started out
as a heart, and then,

16:14.542 --> 16:17.333
you know, it...
went off the rails there.

16:17.417 --> 16:20.458
Where is Lark?

16:23.500 --> 16:25.083
Honey, we just want to make sure

16:25.166 --> 16:26.750
that you're ready
and that you're safe.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.709
Okay, you can get diseases.
You could get pregnant.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.291
You could fall in love.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.375
And isn't that the scariest
thing of all, Samantha?

16:33.291 --> 16:34.667
Wh-What are you doing, Tim?

16:34.750 --> 16:36.709
Trying to keep her a virgin.

16:36.792 --> 16:40.959
What? What's this?
Some kind of weird sex toy?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.834
Dad! We've been dating
for a year,

16:43.917 --> 16:45.625
and we're already in love.

16:45.709 --> 16:46.959
Just because you're in love,

16:47.041 --> 16:48.542
that doesn't mean
that you're ready.

16:48.625 --> 16:51.333
Okay, I thought I was ready
my first time. I wasn't.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.834
It's my decision.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.792
And I promise I'm not
gonna get pregnant.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.792
LARK:
Guess what.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.917
My mommy's pregnant.

16:59.959 --> 17:02.041
She calls the nanny "Mommy."

17:02.125 --> 17:04.083
Yeah. I'm fine with it.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.083
Ugh. She is
a ticking time bomb.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.625
We have to keep her
from saying anything.

17:12.709 --> 17:15.291
Okay. Okay. Um... Ooh, yeah.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.917
Come over here, kiddo.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.375
I want you to get on here
and pedal around,

17:19.458 --> 17:23.208
silently,
and remember our secret.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.458
Hi.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.917
-Guess what.
-Wha...?

17:31.709 --> 17:34.083
Keep pedaling!

17:35.041 --> 17:36.375
You know, after two,

17:36.458 --> 17:38.375
baby fat's just fat.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.250
All right. Come on.
Feel the burn!

17:46.333 --> 17:47.583
Okay. We just have
to keep her eating

17:47.667 --> 17:50.083
-so she doesn't speak.
-Mm-hmm.

17:50.166 --> 17:53.917
Mmm, this cake is so yummy. Huh?
That's why we eat more and more!

17:54.000 --> 17:57.750
Yeah, we just stuff it in our
cute little mouths all the time.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.458
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.583
He's really sending
her mixed messages.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.083
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.125
(doorbell rings)

18:04.208 --> 18:06.083
-Ooh.
-I got it.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.834
No, no, no. I got it.
Uh, excuse me.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.959
Hi-ee, guys. I think
that it's pretty obvious

18:14.041 --> 18:15.375
that there's something
that everybody knows

18:15.458 --> 18:17.083
but no one is talking about.

18:17.166 --> 18:19.542
Uh, but Matt and I feel
that having a baby is

18:19.625 --> 18:21.083
a really big decision

18:21.166 --> 18:23.125
that affects everyone
in the family.

18:23.208 --> 18:26.083
We want to be open and honest.

18:26.166 --> 18:30.125
So that's why we wanted to share
with you the exciting news

18:30.208 --> 18:31.542
that we are adopting.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.750
(cheering)

18:34.834 --> 18:36.125
-Wonderful!
-Congratulations!

18:36.208 --> 18:37.959
Great!

18:38.041 --> 18:39.208
All right, uh, everyone,

18:39.291 --> 18:41.583
I would like for you all
to meet Anthony.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.041
Hi.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.667
-Oh, well,
-Hi!

18:47.750 --> 18:49.834
welcome to the family, dear.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.542
Welcome.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.875
Welcome to the family.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.875
Oh, I'm just
the adoption agent,

18:56.959 --> 18:59.458
-and I'm 26.
-ALL: Oh.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.208
Yeah, he's just here to confirm
that we're a good family

19:01.291 --> 19:03.458
so he can match us with
a baby that needs a home.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.875
Why don't you just take
Mommy's baby?

19:06.959 --> 19:08.041
What?

19:10.333 --> 19:12.500
You're pregnant?!

19:12.583 --> 19:14.959
I am outraged! Whose is it?

19:15.041 --> 19:16.041
Greg.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.291
Yeah, okay. Um...

19:18.375 --> 19:20.542
We are pregnant. (chuckles)

19:20.625 --> 19:22.875
-That's fantastic!
-Babies for everyone.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.375
(cheering)

19:25.458 --> 19:27.458
Uh, I'm really sorry, Matt.
I mean, we weren't even trying,

19:27.542 --> 19:30.333
like, at all, but...
one time, so...

19:30.417 --> 19:32.709
That-That's really great, man.
Congratulations.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.083
But you couldn't even let us
have, like, one moment?

19:35.166 --> 19:36.625
Hey, man, listen.
This isn't our fault.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.834
Lark wasn't supposed
to tell anybody.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.834
MATT:
Yeah, right.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.125
You totally put her up to it.

19:41.208 --> 19:42.333
You had her hold on to it

19:42.417 --> 19:43.417
until we had some good news,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.208
-then you told her to one-up us.
-Oh, come on.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.500
You came here on a bus,
and you smell like urine.

19:47.583 --> 19:50.709
How could I assume that that was
gonna be followed by <i>good </i>news?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.291
-Wait.
-What?

19:53.375 --> 19:54.625
Where's Sam and Ryan?

19:54.709 --> 19:55.667
(Heather gasps)

19:55.750 --> 19:57.208
They're upstairs,
unsupervised.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.083
Tim, how could you
let this happen?

20:00.917 --> 20:02.667
It's like I don't even exist.

20:03.959 --> 20:05.750
Don't worry.
This is a very loving

20:05.834 --> 20:08.166
-and supportive family.
-Mm-hmm.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.041
Would you like to hear
a song about our journey?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.333
CLEMENTINE:
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.875

Oh, boy. Okay.

20:15.959 --> 20:18.667

-No, I'm sorry.
