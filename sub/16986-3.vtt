Amber think it time to review
hunters' recent job performance.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.206
- [Munk groans]
- [all groan]

00:39.289 --> 00:42.084
Oh! Amber think Munk sum it up nicely.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.963
Amber, I know we've been getting
our butts kicked and clawed and bit...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.174
Ow... but I think I came up
with a way to change that.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.677
I call it "hurry up and throw faster"!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.595
Amber stop you there, Grug.

00:53.679 --> 00:57.891
Hunters no need to hunt harder.
Hunters need to hunt smarter.

00:57.975 --> 01:02.104
And Amber know how.
It called "the math."

01:02.187 --> 01:04.188
- [all] Huh?
- Great!

01:04.272 --> 01:07.526
- What is this math and how do we throw it?
- Amber show you.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.695
- [gasps]
- [screeching]

01:09.778 --> 01:12.864
Quick! How many rocks it take
to bonk out molar bear?

01:12.948 --> 01:14.074
- Four.
- Yes.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.578
Now, watch. Amber throw two rocks
and Munk throw two rocks.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.581
But that's only two rocks.
That's not enough bonkage.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.500
That where the math come in. Throw!

01:26.295 --> 01:29.172
See? Two and two is four.

01:30.799 --> 01:35.220
But-but that can't be right. Four is four.
That's why it's called "four."

01:35.304 --> 01:38.890
Huh! We faced a molar bear
and I'm not hurt. Oh, am I dead?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.226
No. That the math.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.061
It make hunting safer.

01:43.145 --> 01:46.940
So, until hunters learn the math,
hunters no hunt!

01:47.024 --> 01:48.442
[grunts]

01:48.525 --> 01:50.777
Amber hire Squawk to teach you.

01:50.861 --> 01:54.781
He stamp handprint on this slab
once you learn the math.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.034
Sure. Whatever. I can learn math.

01:57.659 --> 02:02.706
"The math"! Just "math" sound silly.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.167
[Eep]
Dad!

02:07.210 --> 02:11.006
You're home early. [gasps]
Wait. Did someone get eaten again?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.925
[gasps]
Oh, no! They all got eaten, didn't they?

02:14.009 --> 02:17.512
And only you survived!
How will you live with the guilt?

02:17.596 --> 02:20.474
No, son. Wow, you really ran with that.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.977
No, Amber just sent us away
to learn a new skill: the math.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.981
Squawk's been teaching us that, too,
to add up all the food we give him.

02:28.065 --> 02:32.152
- Turns out, we give him a lot of food.
- I'm sure I'll master the math,

02:32.235 --> 02:35.072
just like I mastered
the round-the-back bonk attack

02:35.155 --> 02:37.824
and the 'tween-the-legs knock-'em-deads.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.452
- [chuckles]
- [Sandy moans, giggles]

02:41.370 --> 02:43.121
[yelping]

02:43.205 --> 02:45.374
[continues yelping]

02:45.457 --> 02:47.042
[chuckles]

02:47.125 --> 02:50.712
Uh, but, Dad, the math
isn't a hunting rock skill.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.299
It's an "up here" skill.
It's pretty hard.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.425
Not for me.

02:55.967 --> 02:56.967
[grunts]

02:57.636 --> 03:01.264
- See? I got "up here" skills. Ow.
- [Thunk] Yeah.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.266
And when you add this new math skill

03:03.350 --> 03:05.352
to your other two hunting skills,

03:05.435 --> 03:06.269
that'll be...

03:06.353 --> 03:08.855
- Ten skills!
- [Eep and Thunk] Three skills.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.734
Right, three. I meant to say three.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.153
Sure you did, Dad. Sure you did.

03:17.531 --> 03:21.326
Wow! This math ain't so bad after all.
Thanks, Teacher Squawk.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.830
If he can learn it after all the times
his head's been bitten,

03:24.913 --> 03:26.373
this should be a breeze.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.876
- Start mathing at me.
- We'll start with basic adding.

03:29.960 --> 03:36.591
That's when you take two numbers and put
them together. So, what's three plus four?

03:38.385 --> 03:42.389
Oh. This is the math. The math
has started. Okay. Let me see, um...

03:44.808 --> 03:48.103
Here's a hint. Give your answer
in the form of a number.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.897
Number. Right.
I have totally heard of those.

03:50.981 --> 03:51.982
Uh...

03:52.899 --> 03:55.819
[Thunk]
<i>Turns out, we give him a lot of food.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:59.698
Oh, of course! Three-four.
Handprint, please.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.783
No. Try again.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.619
Forty-three? Threety-four? Free-thor?

04:04.703 --> 04:08.874
Four... three?

04:08.957 --> 04:12.169
Number...

04:13.378 --> 04:14.379
Handprint, please.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.466
No! Most of what you just said
was nonsense.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.427
Maybe you just need to see the math.

04:20.761 --> 04:25.432
Suppose Splarg holds three eggs
and Splorg holds four.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.978
Splarg and Splorg? Who are they,
and why are they hogging all the food?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.481
- Uh, they're not real people.
- Wh... What?

04:32.564 --> 04:36.193
- How can not-real people hold eggs?
- The eggs also aren't real.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.986
Then what are we even talking about?

04:38.069 --> 04:41.823
[laughing]

04:41.907 --> 04:43.200
Handprint, please.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.368
[growls]

04:46.161 --> 04:48.955
Okay, you have three smashfruit.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.624
I do? Great!

04:50.707 --> 04:54.628
I take away one.
Now, how many do you have?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.713
- Three.
- No, no, count them.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.548
One, two...

05:03.428 --> 05:06.348
- [groans]
- Three!

05:06.431 --> 05:11.394
No! [grunts] Teaching you
makes me miss teaching children.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.312
[groans]

05:12.395 --> 05:17.484
Look, Squawk, let's level with each other.
Neither of us wants to be here, so...

05:17.567 --> 05:20.987
- Huh? Huh? Huh?
- [growls]

05:21.071 --> 05:25.534
You got every question wrong.
You need to give me something.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.247
Can that something be food?

05:30.330 --> 05:34.668
[gasps]
Are you trying to bribe me?

05:35.293 --> 05:38.004
Thank goodness!
I thought we'd be here all day.

05:38.088 --> 05:42.133
Amber's giving me one carcass
per hunter, so...

05:42.217 --> 05:45.220
I'll give you nine animal carcasses,
not a carcass more.

05:45.303 --> 05:51.768
Hmm... Tell you what, I'll do it for just
three piles of six carcasses each.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.272
[laughs]
Deal! No take-backs!

05:56.356 --> 05:59.901
Wow, you really don't get the math.

06:01.111 --> 06:05.156
Huh, Amber impressed.
Everyone learned the math,

06:05.240 --> 06:08.577
even Munk, who has brain like tiny bug.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.870
[buzzing]

06:10.954 --> 06:14.457
[chuckles]
Believe me, I am just as surprised as you.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.458
[buzzing]

06:15.542 --> 06:19.212
The math is so easy.
I can totally math any number now.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.133
Great! Then how about you and Munk
go bonk bear owl?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.135
[growling]

06:25.218 --> 06:28.805
- You got it.
- And bonk I will. [chuckles]

06:29.139 --> 06:29.973
Yeah.

06:30.056 --> 06:34.060
Okay, Grug, these take six rocks
to bonk. I'll do three.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.563
Got you, buddy. Then I'll do...

06:36.646 --> 06:41.443
Let me see... Six and three.
So, I need threety-six.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.237
No, wait, that was when
Splarg had those eggs.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.156
Um...

06:49.534 --> 06:51.036
[growls]

06:51.119 --> 06:52.746
[screams]

06:54.706 --> 06:55.915
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Think.

06:55.999 --> 07:01.546
I had three smash fruits and Squawk took
one, so I need to throw one rock. Bingo!

07:01.630 --> 07:03.923
- [groaning]
- [screams]

07:04.549 --> 07:05.842
[groaning]

07:07.552 --> 07:08.803
- [groans]
- [chuckles]

07:08.887 --> 07:13.892
Oops. Guess I forgot to carry the Splorg.
That is a math thing, right?

07:14.726 --> 07:15.726
Yep.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.481
Oh, and a heads-up: I might bleed out.

07:19.564 --> 07:23.568
Amber tell Grug,
Grug no learn the math, Grug no hunt.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.487
But... but I'm a hunter.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.030
[growls]

07:27.113 --> 07:33.119
Until Grug learn the math,
Grug not hunter!

07:34.496 --> 07:35.664
[growling]

07:35.747 --> 07:37.707
Fine! Forget hunting.

07:37.791 --> 07:43.254
I'll get a different job, a better job
where I'll never have to math ever again!

07:43.338 --> 07:47.884
Great! I mean, too late for me,
but great for you. [groans]

07:48.301 --> 07:52.389
Gathering moves a lot slower
than hunting, Grug.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.977
If anything, you might
be over-qualified. [laughs]

07:57.060 --> 07:58.728
Yeah, that's going to be true,

07:58.812 --> 08:01.606
but I'm just glad to work
where things make sense again.

08:01.690 --> 08:06.778
Excuse me. I need two spike apples
for each of my four family members.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.322
[screams]

08:09.406 --> 08:11.825
Four family members,
two spike apples each.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.618
Hey! Wait, this sounds like the math.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.912
Five spike apples for me,
plus three for my brother.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.415
Wait. Add two for me
and subtract one for my brother.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.583
And I'll take double that, plus six more.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.836
Yeah, that was the clearest way
to say that.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.839
[whimpering]

08:25.922 --> 08:27.382
- I need six...
- Take away three...

08:27.465 --> 08:31.720
[voices overlapping]

08:31.803 --> 08:35.222
Add seven, add seven, add seven,
add seven, add seven, add seven...

08:35.306 --> 08:37.808
Grug, if a hunter has
five-seven-twenty rocks

08:37.892 --> 08:41.020
and there are thirty-six-nine-ten
bear owls, how many...

08:41.104 --> 08:43.106
[whimpering]

08:43.940 --> 08:48.069
[whimpering]
No math! No math!

08:48.153 --> 08:52.073
Well, the service in this garden
has really gone downhill.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.157
And how.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.326
No!

08:55.410 --> 08:57.078
[Grug whimpering]

08:57.162 --> 09:00.206
The math is everywhere.
Everywhere! All I see are numbers.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.374
Three, four...

09:02.125 --> 09:03.352
- [screams] Eleven.
- [squawking]

09:03.376 --> 09:08.298
I was wrong. I need to learn the math,
and I need you to teach me.

09:08.381 --> 09:13.303
I see. Well, then, I have only
one question. Who are you again?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.723
Grug! Please, I need your help
or I'll never hunt again! [crying]

09:16.806 --> 09:19.768
Okay, stop, before I'm caught
making another student cry.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.394
[continues crying]

09:22.103 --> 09:25.231
[sighs] Didn't you ever learn things
to become a hunter?

09:25.315 --> 09:28.151
Yeah, but it's different
when a predator's charging at you.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.279
- You have no choice but to learn.
- Oh, really?

09:31.362 --> 09:33.031
[screams]

09:33.114 --> 09:34.115
[body thuds]

09:34.199 --> 09:36.743
Hey! What's the big idea here?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.953
[screeching]

09:39.037 --> 09:41.247
Oh, that's the big idea.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.085
[Squawk]
I'll throw down rocks to you.

09:45.168 --> 09:50.423
Just use the math to tell me
exactly how many you need, or die.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.800
This is insane!

09:51.883 --> 09:55.428
No, this is teaching.
More math, less whining, please.

09:55.512 --> 10:00.475
To bonk two molar bears,
you need how many rocks? Hmm?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.185
[screams]

10:02.268 --> 10:03.436
[body thuds]

10:03.520 --> 10:05.522
- [screeching continues]
- [screams]

10:05.605 --> 10:06.898
Bonk them!

10:06.981 --> 10:10.860
I can't. It takes four rocks
just to bonk one molar bear,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.780
and I only have two rocks.

10:14.823 --> 10:15.823
[screeching]

10:15.865 --> 10:17.784
[Grug thinking]
<i>So, I guess I die now.</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:20.286
<i>Time to make these
the best throws of my life,</i>

10:20.370 --> 10:23.498
<i>like double the power,</i>
<i>or even triple the power, or...</i> [gasps]

10:23.581 --> 10:24.457
<i>Wait.</i>

10:24.541 --> 10:28.419
<i>I can throw one rock
with the power of four rocks!</i>

10:29.254 --> 10:30.380
Ha!

10:33.508 --> 10:36.344
[grunting]

10:36.427 --> 10:39.556
[screeching, screaming]

10:39.639 --> 10:40.932
Whoa.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.767
Grug, you're a genius.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.562
By giving one rock
the strength of many rocks,

10:45.645 --> 10:48.273
you've stumbled onto a whole new math.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.775
It's many-plication!

10:50.859 --> 10:53.945
No, it's something way better than that.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.614
It's brute force!

11:01.035 --> 11:04.581
[all grunting]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.416
[bellowing]

11:06.499 --> 11:10.920
Amber must ask...
how Grug get so smart?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.631
Well, Amber, all it took
was working extra hard

11:13.715 --> 11:16.968
to learn that the math
is totally useless.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.262
Actually, you're using the math right now.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.348
[all chanting]
Brute force, brute force, brute force...

11:22.432 --> 11:27.604
What you call brute force is a higher form
of math that I'm calling "physics."

11:28.521 --> 11:30.148
[screams, groans]

11:30.231 --> 11:33.234
[chanting continues]
Brute force, brute force, brute force!

11:42.076 --> 11:45.330
[music playing]

11:47.707 --> 11:49.042
[all grunting]

11:49.125 --> 11:52.545
Whoo-hoo! This was a great idea, Lerk!

11:52.629 --> 11:55.715
Hey, pump up the volume to eleven!

11:56.466 --> 11:57.884
[insects chirping]

11:58.760 --> 12:02.680
Nine, ten, eleven!

12:02.764 --> 12:07.644
Okay, that is enough!
Go shake your stuff somewhere else.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.354
[insects buzzing]

12:09.437 --> 12:12.607
[music playing]

12:12.690 --> 12:14.984
Take that ear-bleeding filth
somewhere else!

12:15.068 --> 12:19.656
I can't hear myself think,
and my thoughts are really interesting!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.074
[all groan]

12:21.157 --> 12:23.451
Oh... much better.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.286
- [crowd cheering]
- [Snoot laughing]

12:25.370 --> 12:26.370
Me!

12:26.621 --> 12:29.332
Oh, yes. That's a brilliant thought.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.335
[music playing]

12:32.418 --> 12:33.336
[insects chirping]

12:33.419 --> 12:38.675
[laughs] Grown-ups don't get it!
How can they think this is too loud?

12:38.758 --> 12:42.261
Yes! Or no!
I have no idea what you're saying!

12:42.345 --> 12:47.266
Hey, Eep, check out my new dance,
"the Running Prey"!

12:47.350 --> 12:48.393
Ooh!

12:48.476 --> 12:50.937
[grunting]
Ooh!

12:51.020 --> 12:53.690
Or my new move, "the Pop and Rock"!

12:58.528 --> 13:01.948
Ooh! I got one, too! "The Rockslide"!

13:02.031 --> 13:04.659
[grunting to music]

13:04.742 --> 13:06.619
[continues grunting]

13:12.792 --> 13:14.293
[all scream]

13:16.421 --> 13:18.715
- Our music!
- Our Womp!

13:19.382 --> 13:22.927
I thought he'd live 30, maybe,
I don't know, 40 more days?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.221
[grunting]

13:27.181 --> 13:28.766
I'm highly squishable.

13:29.851 --> 13:34.313
Whew! That was close. But we're safe,
as long as nobody tells our...

13:34.397 --> 13:36.566
Whoa, whoa! Hey!
Did I just hear a rockslide?

13:36.649 --> 13:40.069
Uh, no. That was just our music.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.614
[scoffs] I wish your awful music sounded
half as soothing as a rockslide.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.243
Come on, is everybody okay?
What happened?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.870
Well, first, we were doing this.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.913
[grunting]

13:50.997 --> 13:52.749
And a couple of these.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.709
[grunting]

13:56.461 --> 13:59.130
And then we were, like,
"Oh, no, we're going to die!"

13:59.213 --> 14:04.093
[screams]
So, dancing caused this rockslide.

14:04.177 --> 14:08.806
No! Well, yes,
but only 'cause we were dancing here.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.350
You wouldn't let us dance anywhere else.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.227
Because dancing is trouble.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.980
The only reason to ever
throw your hands in the air

14:16.064 --> 14:18.149
is to keep bugs away from your hair.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.110
What we need to do is ban dancing.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.653
[all gasp]

14:22.737 --> 14:23.863
I hate saying this...

14:23.946 --> 14:26.908
like, it pains my chest
to say these three small words, but...

14:26.991 --> 14:29.952
Snoot is right.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.829
That was very satisfying.

14:31.913 --> 14:35.875
Dancing is just too dangerous.
Just look what it did to this poor boy.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.127
Oh. [chuckles]
That's how Womp always looks.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.964
He's always been that squat?
But Squat Boy almost died.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.759
Womp almost dies a lot.

14:44.842 --> 14:49.263
Don't blame dancing.
It's not dangerous. It's fun!

14:49.347 --> 14:52.809
And fun was invented
by people who die young,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.936
so, no, that doesn't change my mind.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.188
Dancing is banned and that is final.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.481
[groans]

14:58.564 --> 15:02.276
Eep, this is about safety.
We're not banning it to be mean.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.655
[growls]

15:06.489 --> 15:11.285
[groans] Now that I've been told
I can't dance, it's all I want to do.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.497
[groans]
If we don't find a place to dance soon,

15:14.580 --> 15:17.208
I'm going to crawl into a hole and die.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.210
Wait. That's a great idea.

15:19.293 --> 15:26.134
Somewhere no adults will look for us.
Right under their feet! Ta-da!

15:26.217 --> 15:27.718
- Awesome!
- Cool!

15:27.802 --> 15:30.847
We'll make it our secret
underground dance club.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.057
Lerk, give me some club-opening music.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.352
[insects chirping]

15:36.436 --> 15:41.023
[music playing]

15:41.107 --> 15:43.943
[record scratching]

16:01.252 --> 16:02.962
[whimpering]

16:05.298 --> 16:06.924
[screams]

16:07.008 --> 16:11.179
[all cheering]

16:11.262 --> 16:14.015
Can I get a "Womp Wah"?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.475
[all]
Womp Wah!

16:15.558 --> 16:18.686
[all cheering]

16:18.769 --> 16:20.438
You did it, buddy!

16:20.521 --> 16:22.440
You beat the ban!

16:22.523 --> 16:24.901
[indifferently]
And look how happy you made me.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.197
And I can peel away
the mask I show the world

16:29.280 --> 16:31.782
and reveal the real,
beautiful me underneath!

16:31.866 --> 16:33.409
[giggling]

16:37.038 --> 16:41.083
[sighs] Dancing feels even better
when you know it's banned.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.920
[grunting]
Check out my new move,

16:44.003 --> 16:45.838
"the Molar Bear"!

16:45.922 --> 16:47.715
[growling]

16:47.798 --> 16:49.258
[all cheer]

16:51.802 --> 16:53.721
[snoring]

16:53.804 --> 16:55.306
[growls]

17:00.686 --> 17:05.733
Huh. No awful music,
no screams of danger, no anything.

17:05.816 --> 17:12.281
[takes deep breath]
This peace and quiet is just lovely.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.160
We should ban more problems.
What if we ban smelly people?

17:16.243 --> 17:18.412
You know what the best part of this is?

17:18.496 --> 17:21.290
For once, Eep is obeying me
without question.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.416
My boys are obeying me, too.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.796
Though it's less impressive since
they're not animals, like your children.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.840
[chuckles] Normally, I'd want to punch you
for saying something like that,

17:29.924 --> 17:32.301
but, see, we're even getting along.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.012
[both laugh]

17:35.096 --> 17:38.558
- [laughing uneasily]
- [sighs]

17:38.641 --> 17:40.226
Something is wrong here, isn't it?

17:40.309 --> 17:43.771
Oh, yeah. Horribly wrong.
Our kids are definitely up to something.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.773
But how will we know what they're doing?

17:45.856 --> 17:48.192
It's not like we can just
talk to our children.

17:48.276 --> 17:53.072
No. To catch teens,
we must become teens.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.784
Hey, cool guy. Wait up.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.873
- Uh, who are you?
- Two of your fellow youths.

18:02.957 --> 18:07.336
We're new to the valley.
I'm Snoo... itch. Snitch. [chuckles]

18:07.420 --> 18:09.005
And my name's Narc.

18:09.088 --> 18:16.095
You do anything fun and risky around here,
like, I don't know... dance?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.430
Hmm?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.016
No, dancing is dangerous.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.645
- We totally dance, but in secret.
- Oh, yeah?

18:24.729 --> 18:30.776
Cool. Hey, why don't you show us guys
this secret dance place... bro?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.653
How do I know you're cool?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.782
Uh, how do we know you're cool?

18:36.866 --> 18:40.328
Yes, he seems decidedly un- "with it."
Don't you agree?

18:40.453 --> 18:44.123
Uh... Wait! Wait, I'm cool. I'm cool!

18:44.206 --> 18:46.542
I'll show you
where the dance party is, Narc.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.006
[music playing underground]

18:54.634 --> 18:55.635
[moans]

19:02.350 --> 19:07.480
Hey, Sandy, can you help Daddy shut down
the dance party? Huh? Can you?

19:11.442 --> 19:12.777
[moans excitedly]

19:15.029 --> 19:16.113
[moans]

19:16.197 --> 19:18.741
[music playing]

19:25.456 --> 19:28.376
Dancing! Look at all this danger.

19:28.459 --> 19:32.296
Loose rocks, possible cave-in,
terrible music.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.091
- Who is behind all this?
- [all] Go, Eep!

19:35.174 --> 19:38.177
[all chanting]
Go, Eep! Go, go, go, Eep!

19:38.260 --> 19:40.471
See? You are the worst parent.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.557
[insects buzzing]

19:43.641 --> 19:49.480
By the authority of being a parent,
this underground dance party is shut down.

19:49.563 --> 19:56.445
Go home, or, well, you can't stay here.
And wherever you do go, no dancing.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.074
Dad, you can't take away our dance!

20:00.157 --> 20:01.784
That's right, move along.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.036
Also, Eep, you're grounded.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.956
And, Thunk, where are you?
You're grounded, too.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.208
You'll only make me want to dance more!

20:09.291 --> 20:11.961
Bulk and Sulk, you'd better
believe you're grounded.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.422
Lerk, say it with me. You are...

20:14.505 --> 20:16.882
Grounded?

20:16.966 --> 20:20.469
Correct! And, Pat, grounded.
Squat kid, grounded.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.139
Kevin, you let us in so you're cool.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.390
[all growl]

20:24.473 --> 20:25.766
[chuckles nervously]

20:25.850 --> 20:27.017
This way, people!

20:27.101 --> 20:29.478
- [screeching]
- Or maybe a different way.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.604
[all scream]

20:30.688 --> 20:33.524
See, Eep? Look what your dancing
has caused now.

20:33.607 --> 20:38.571
What? This happened
because you're yelling at us not to dance!

20:38.654 --> 20:40.865
How could you possibly know that?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.742
[screeching]

20:48.414 --> 20:49.498
Point taken.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.708
[screams]

20:52.501 --> 20:54.086
[screaming]

20:57.757 --> 20:58.632
[gasps]

20:58.716 --> 21:03.095
Dance can save my dad.
Everyone, quick! Do the Rockslide!

21:03.179 --> 21:04.513
[music playing]

21:04.597 --> 21:07.016
This is no time to shake your booty!

21:07.099 --> 21:08.017
Come on!

21:08.100 --> 21:10.436
I... I can't dance.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.146
Oh, sure you can.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.997
[yelps, groans]

21:30.080 --> 21:32.291
[screeching continues]

21:33.167 --> 21:34.376
[screams]

21:35.669 --> 21:39.298
- We did it!
- [all cheering]

21:39.381 --> 21:40.381
Ow.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.553
Quick! Dance after me!

21:50.226 --> 21:51.519
[all gasp]

21:58.651 --> 22:00.027
[rumbling]

22:00.110 --> 22:03.823
[all coughing]

22:03.906 --> 22:05.616
Okay, looking back,

22:05.699 --> 22:10.538
maybe it wasn't a great idea to dance
inside an underground death trap.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.332
True, but you wouldn't have felt
the need to do that

22:13.415 --> 22:16.126
if I hadn't banned dancing
in the first place.

22:16.210 --> 22:19.213
Shaking your butts actually saved
our butts down there.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.716
So, dancing is unbanned?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.844
[Snoot]
Of course it's unbanned!

22:24.927 --> 22:27.012
[humming]

22:27.096 --> 22:28.347
Ew.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.058
Why was I ever against this?

22:31.141 --> 22:33.561
Now, that should be banned.
