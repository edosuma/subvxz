Joey, how can

01:33.844 --> 01:37.681
you read that junk?

01:37.723 --> 01:41.727
Oh, my God. He went

01:37.723 --> 01:41.727
to the same school I did.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.478
Attention all family members.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.272
Report to

01:43.520 --> 01:45.272
the kitchen immediately.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.816
Training camp is about to begin.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.816
Don't try to make a run for it.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.317
I've got the house

01:47.858 --> 01:49.317
completely surrounded.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.736
Move it, move it, move it.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.363
- Hut, hut, hut. Let's go.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.363
- What's going on?

01:53.405 --> 01:56.533
- What's wrong?

01:53.405 --> 01:56.533
- Attention.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.744
As you were.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.288
God, I love

01:58.786 --> 02:01.288
the sound of my own voice.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.831
As you all know, this weekend

02:02.873 --> 02:04.959
Tanners from all across

02:02.873 --> 02:04.959
this great country of ours

02:05.000 --> 02:06.418
are gathering at Lake Pollock

02:06.460 --> 02:09.088
for a fun

02:06.460 --> 02:09.088
family reunion and picnic.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.799
First we're gonna hug them,

02:09.129 --> 02:11.799
then we're gonna kiss them..

02:11.840 --> 02:14.009
And then once

02:11.840 --> 02:14.009
those picnic games begin..

02:14.051 --> 02:17.054
...we are gonna

02:14.051 --> 02:17.054
kick some Tanner behind.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.807
Michelle..

02:19.848 --> 02:22.559
You will be with Uncle Jesse

02:19.848 --> 02:22.559
in the balloon relay race.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.813
Alright. We're gonna

02:22.601 --> 02:25.813
kick some Tanner behinds.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.568
Where does she get this stuff?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.821
Okay, DJ and Steph..

02:33.862 --> 02:37.449
You two will be tied together

02:33.862 --> 02:37.449
in the three-legged race.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.367
We won't let you down, dad.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.161
Deej, we've gotta practice.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.913
From now until the picnic

02:42.955 --> 02:45.457
we'll spend day

02:42.955 --> 02:45.457
and night tied together.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.542
Sounds like a dream come true.

02:49.003 --> 02:52.131
Someone needs to work

02:49.003 --> 02:52.131
on her team spirit.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.678
Joey!

02:57.719 --> 02:59.888
As the only winner

02:57.719 --> 02:59.888
from our family last year..

02:59.930 --> 03:02.390
We are counting on you

02:59.930 --> 03:02.390
to repeat as champion

03:02.432 --> 03:04.309
in the pie-eating contest.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.854
I am the world's

03:04.351 --> 03:06.854
greatest pie-eater.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.772
Nobody can touch me.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.440
Aunt Phyllis,

03:08.814 --> 03:10.440
if you're out there

03:10.482 --> 03:12.400
doing your needlepoint,

03:10.482 --> 03:12.400
know this..

03:12.442 --> 03:14.653
...I will destroy you!

03:17.948 --> 03:20.868
Okay, man.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.868
You can pump up with these.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.911
- Get practicing.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.911
- Alright.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.663
Who wants to spar

03:22.953 --> 03:24.663
with the champ?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.623
I need a little

03:24.705 --> 03:26.623
competition here.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.167
Oh, blueberry.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.668
I'll try.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.046
Okay, assume the position.

03:33.005 --> 03:36.050
And, go!

03:36.091 --> 03:37.801
Come on, come on, come on.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.720
- Come on, Aunt Becky.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.720
- Come on, Uncle Joey.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.722
Come on, come on, come on.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.184
[all screaming excitedly]

03:45.225 --> 03:46.727
Faster! Come on, faster, guys!

03:49.396 --> 03:51.565
Beat Aunt Becky!

03:51.606 --> 03:53.775
Becky's gaining on you, Joey!

03:51.606 --> 03:53.775
Come on!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.366
Go!

04:05.204 --> 04:07.288
Did we run out of forks?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.291
Hi, honey.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.460
Be with you in a jiff.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.214
It's okay. I'll just

04:12.502 --> 04:15.214
stay here and snack.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.885
- Finished.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.885
- We have a new champion.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.386
- Great.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.386
- Yes.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.681
Hey, man, no fair.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.271
She's having twins.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.271
She's eating for three.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.900
Besides, I think I had

04:31.312 --> 04:34.900
a blueberry up my nose.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.194
This is all very fascinating

04:37.236 --> 04:38.653
but I wanna

04:37.236 --> 04:38.653
tell you guys something.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.155
I just met with

04:38.695 --> 04:40.155
a new record company, and they

04:40.197 --> 04:41.865
heard my music,

04:40.197 --> 04:41.865
and they loved it.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.617
- Oh, honey, that's great.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.617
- Good for you.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.035
It's not a done deal yet.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.703
They said they'd

04:45.077 --> 04:46.703
give me a record contract

04:46.745 --> 04:48.538
if I come up with

04:46.745 --> 04:48.538
one great hit song.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.082
I got very big news.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.292
You're my partner

04:50.124 --> 04:52.292
in the balloon race.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.086
Oh, yeah.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.086
That's right, at the picnic.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.337
- Let's practice right now.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.337
- Alright, we will, I promise.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.839
But right now

04:56.379 --> 04:57.839
I'm gonna go downstairs

04:57.881 --> 04:59.925
and I'm gonna write

04:57.881 --> 04:59.925
the greatest song ever written.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.677
Just give me 10 minutes.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.139
That is the kind of

05:02.719 --> 05:05.139
groundless confidence we need

05:05.180 --> 05:07.224
to win that

05:05.180 --> 05:07.224
Tanner family trophy.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.143
Because..

05:09.184 --> 05:13.230
We are the bay area Tanners

05:09.184 --> 05:13.230
and we are gonna win, alright?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.899
Aunt Phyllis, you are dead meat.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.032
Come on, Deej,

05:22.281 --> 05:24.032
we have to practice

05:24.074 --> 05:25.659
for the three-legged race.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.870
Steph, can't you

05:25.700 --> 05:28.870
see that I'm busy?

05:28.912 --> 05:32.415
Dad, DJ's not

05:28.912 --> 05:32.415
showing any team spirit!

05:32.457 --> 05:34.334
Alright, alright,

05:32.457 --> 05:34.334
let's get this over with.

05:34.375 --> 05:38.213
Okay, now tie it up real tight

05:34.375 --> 05:38.213
so it won't fall off.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.967
Now, we have to practice

05:38.255 --> 05:41.967
day and night, night and day..

05:42.009 --> 05:44.886
...until we have

05:42.009 --> 05:44.886
it perfect, so we can win.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.471
Okay.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.599
Okay, now let's practice

05:46.513 --> 05:49.599
walking first. Ready, go.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.394
[telephone ringing]

05:53.436 --> 05:55.563
That's my phone.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.563
I bet it's Ben Andrews.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
He's unbelievably hot.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.735
I can't get this knot out.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.279
Ben, don't hang up.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.363
Steph, you're coming with me.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.824
But we have to practice.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.534
We'll practice going upstairs.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.534
Come on.

Inside, outside, inside,

Joey, I hope you have a good

reason for interrupting me.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.626
I sure do.

Another Elvis sighting.

This time they

08:24.254 --> 08:25.672
spotted him in Portland

08:25.713 --> 08:28.091
playing miniature golf

08:25.713 --> 08:28.091
with bigfoot.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.432
Hi, honey.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.976
- How's the song going?

08:35.474 --> 08:37.976
- Oh, terrific. Great.

He gots nothing.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.105
I got nothing because

08:40.395 --> 08:42.105
I got no privacy here.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.399
Can you people just

08:42.147 --> 08:44.399
please leave me alone?

08:44.441 --> 08:46.776
Okay, Mr. Cranky Pants.

take this the wrong way, but..

09:07.381 --> 09:09.216
Thank you.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.302
Uncle Jesse, I have an idea.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.889
You should write a song

09:12.344 --> 09:15.889
about a turtle and a duck.

Thank you, Michelle. Run along.

You gotta belong

11:02.787 --> 11:05.582
Dad said it wouldn't shrink,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.582
but I think it's just cheaper.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.586
This is what I gotta

11:07.208 --> 11:09.586
talk to you about.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.796
I've been up for four days, I

11:09.628 --> 11:11.796
can't come up with a decent song

11:11.838 --> 11:14.841
so I'm gonna pass on this picnic

11:11.838 --> 11:14.841
thing and stay home and work.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.530
Don't you guys understand?

It's my one shot

11:36.571 --> 11:38.114

11:38.156 --> 11:41.201
But you're my partner

11:38.156 --> 11:41.201
in the balloon race.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.078
- Well, get another partner.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.078
- But you promised.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.789
- Michelle, I can't.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.789
- But you promised.

Michelle, I have

11:46.831 --> 11:48.500
to write a song.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.126
But you promised.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.752
Well, then

11:50.168 --> 11:51.752
I'm gonna break my promise.

I'm not going to the stupid

11:51.794 --> 11:54.506
picnic, so leave me alone.

11:54.548 --> 11:59.010
- Jess.

11:54.548 --> 11:59.010
- Uncle Jesse yelled at me.

11:59.052 --> 12:03.181
Oh, Michelle, I'm sure

11:59.052 --> 12:03.181
he didn't mean anything by it.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.308

Kimmy, stop

13:32.103 --> 13:33.980
looking at Stephanie.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.190
Something stinks.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.777
Well, we're in the woods, honey.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.777
It's probably a skunk.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.613
I know that smell.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.573
Kimmy, put your shoes back on.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.158
- Oh, give me a break.

Fresh cup of coffee,

13:52.999 --> 13:55.460
black, and keep it coming.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.010
Switch to decaf, will you, son?

14:01.215 --> 14:04.010
You're jangling my nerves.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.014
I'm sorry,

14:05.970 --> 14:08.014
I just have a lot on my mind.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.267
Hey, sonny, make me

14:09.474 --> 14:11.267
one of them sprout salads.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.936
And put the low-cal dressing

14:11.309 --> 14:13.936
on the side, will you?

14:13.978 --> 14:16.690
Thank you, thank you very much.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.775
I lost 72 pounds

14:16.731 --> 14:18.775
on this diet, man.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.444
I got sprouts

14:18.817 --> 14:21.444

14:23.988 --> 14:27.158
You know,

14:23.988 --> 14:27.158
you look exactly like..

14:27.200 --> 14:28.535
Well, no, you're gone. I mean..

14:28.576 --> 14:30.077
You're

14:28.576 --> 14:30.077
not gone, you're here, but..

14:32.539 --> 14:35.625
Never mind me, I'm,

14:32.539 --> 14:35.625
I'm just, I'm having a bad day.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.835
Go ahead, finish your salad.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.712
You don't wanna

14:36.876 --> 14:38.712
hear my problems.

14:38.753 --> 14:42.256
- Probably not.

14:38.753 --> 14:42.256
- My problem is my family.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.425
They're driving me nuts,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.425
so I blew up at them.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.845
You see, I finally

14:44.467 --> 14:46.845
got a shot at a record deal

14:46.886 --> 14:49.764
but I gotta come up

14:46.886 --> 14:49.764
with one really great song.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.184
And they're all mad because I'm

14:49.806 --> 14:53.184
not going to some stupid picnic.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.144
Picnic?

14:55.186 --> 14:57.647
They gonna have barbecue there?

14:57.689 --> 15:00.316
I guess so. But I don't

14:57.689 --> 15:00.316
have time for that, you know.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.902
My whole career's on the line.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.987
Well, why aren't you home

15:02.943 --> 15:04.987
working on the record?

15:05.029 --> 15:07.240
Well, I'm practically finished.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.869
I just, you know,

15:07.281 --> 15:10.869
I came out for a cup of coffee.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.830
- You got nothing, do you, boy?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.830
- Well, I--

15:13.872 --> 15:17.625
I wrote a song

15:13.872 --> 15:17.625
about a turtle and a duck.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.837
Not really top 40, though.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.839
You wanna know

15:20.879 --> 15:22.839
what my real problem is?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.091
Yeah, lay it on me.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.595
See, I got twins coming.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.054
I want them to be

15:28.636 --> 15:30.054
proud of their old man.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.264
I wanna be a success, you know.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.099
It's why I've been

15:31.305 --> 15:33.099
working so hard.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.269
I want them to look up and see

15:33.140 --> 15:36.269
platinum records on the wall.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.605
Babies don't care

15:36.310 --> 15:38.605
about platinum records.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.231
All they care about

15:38.646 --> 15:40.231
is if their daddy loves 'em.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.358
If he's there

15:40.273 --> 15:42.358
to hug and kiss them.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.111
Shame on you for snapping at

15:42.400 --> 15:45.111
your family. Over a picnic?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.532
I also broke a promise

15:47.196 --> 15:49.532
to my 4-year-old niece.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.995
I wish you hadn't told me that.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.081
I mean, you're so busy

15:55.037 --> 15:57.081
chasing your pot of gold.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.000
You're forgetting

15:57.123 --> 16:00.000
what's really important.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.880
If you wanna be a success,

16:00.042 --> 16:03.880
then you be a good father.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.674
A good husband, a good friend.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.177
After that, it's all gravy.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.177
Oh, that sounds good.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.430
Hey, sonny, throw some gravy

16:10.219 --> 16:12.430
on that salad, will you?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.643
Well, it all

16:14.432 --> 16:16.643
makes a lot of sense.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.353
Thanks a lot. I don't know

16:16.684 --> 16:19.353
why I dumped all this on you.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.692
I feel like

16:21.355 --> 16:24.692
I know you or something.

16:24.734 --> 16:28.279
Hey, let me, uh,

16:24.734 --> 16:28.279
buy your meal, huh?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.448
Thank you, thank you very much.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.202
I swear, the way you said "Thank

16:32.074 --> 16:35.202
you, thank you very much."

16:35.244 --> 16:38.247
- You remind me so much of--

16:35.244 --> 16:38.247
- I know. Wayne Newton.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.628
Thanks a lot.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.339
You have a nice night.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.133
Listen, son,

16:46.380 --> 16:49.133
it's kind of cold out there.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.803
You might need this.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.347
Now, you take care of business.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.769
Hey, son,

16:56.766 --> 16:59.769
throw some gravy, come on.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.729
Thank you.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.273
Let me see them mushrooms.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.279
I hope they can fix the van.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.489
What if they can't?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.574
What if we're

17:11.531 --> 17:13.574
stuck here forever?

17:13.616 --> 17:17.411
In that case, we're bear snacks.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.289
Alright, Danny, I think

17:17.453 --> 17:20.289
I got it. Give it a try.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.208
Oh, Joey.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.836
Alright, we did it!

17:22.249 --> 17:24.836
We got the hood open.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.591
Oh, man.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.591
No wonder we broke down.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.677
It's filthy under here.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.428
We're in big trouble.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.181
Somebody's coming.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.142
I hope it's the ice cream man.

17:44.104 --> 17:47.191
- Alright.

17:44.104 --> 17:47.191
- Honey, what're you doing here?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.902
I was gonna meet

17:47.233 --> 17:48.902
you guys at the picnic.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.362
- Something wrong with the van?

17:48.943 --> 17:51.362
- Yeah, the engine is filthy.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.239
Come on, have

17:51.404 --> 17:53.239
a look for yourself.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.453
- Joey, give it a start.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.453
- Okay.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.000
Alright.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.835
Alright, turn it off.

18:08.379 --> 18:12.132
if I hadn't got the hood open.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.802
Look, guys, you'll never guess

18:12.174 --> 18:14.802
who I met today in a diner.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.930
- Who?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.930
- Well, it's guy.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.099
He looked exactly like..

18:20.140 --> 18:22.268
...Wayne Newton.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.647
But, uh, we got

18:23.519 --> 18:26.647
to talking, and, uh..

18:28.066 --> 18:30.818
I'm sorry I snapped

18:28.066 --> 18:30.818
at you guys today.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.862
I just got so wrapped

18:30.860 --> 18:32.862
up in this record deal..

18:32.904 --> 18:35.698
You know, riding around

18:32.904 --> 18:35.698
on my high horse, that..

18:35.740 --> 18:37.408
...I forgot about the things

18:35.740 --> 18:37.408
that are important

18:37.450 --> 18:38.952
to me in my life.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.161
And that's

18:38.993 --> 18:41.161
the people that I love.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.956
You guys.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.707
So, uh..

18:44.749 --> 18:46.042
I hope you can forgive me.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.461
Oh, of course I can forgive you.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.716
You can let go now, Kimmy.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.135
Jess, don't be

18:53.758 --> 18:56.135
so hard on yourself.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.137
We know what kinda

18:56.176 --> 18:58.137
pressure you've been under.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.139
No, we don't.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.310
Come on, Michelle.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.312
Can't you forgive

19:04.351 --> 19:06.312
your Uncle Jesse?

19:06.353 --> 19:09.690
Your name is Uncle Meanie.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.652
- You're still mad at me, huh?

19:09.732 --> 19:12.652
- Duh.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.914
Well, I deserve a "duh".

19:24.956 --> 19:26.624
I'm sorry I let you down, kid.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.711
You yelled

19:26.666 --> 19:30.711
and you broke a promise.

19:30.753 --> 19:34.173
Well, if it makes you feel

19:30.753 --> 19:34.173
better, I felt terrible all day.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.676
- That helps a little.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.676
- Alright then..

19:36.717 --> 19:38.260
How about this..

19:38.302 --> 19:40.387
You and I are gonna

19:38.302 --> 19:40.387
enter that balloon race

19:40.429 --> 19:42.015
and we're gonna win

19:40.429 --> 19:42.015
and we're gonna have

19:42.056 --> 19:43.850
the most fun we've

19:42.056 --> 19:43.850
ever had in our whole life.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.686
- How do you like that?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.686
- That helps a lot.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.438
Alright, munchkin.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.438
Come on, give me a little love.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.902
Excuse me. Everything okay here?

19:54.944 --> 19:56.278
Yes, officer.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.571
Okay, that's it then.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.157
Why don't we go?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.157
Everybody in the van.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.746
Dad, haven't you

20:03.995 --> 20:05.746
polished that long enough?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.540
You're starting to

20:05.788 --> 20:07.540
wear off the inscription.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.375
But, I'm just so darn

20:07.581 --> 20:09.375
proud of you guys.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.877
It was almost a total sweep.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.754
We took the balloon relay

20:10.918 --> 20:13.754
and the three-legged race.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.507
Too bad about

20:13.796 --> 20:16.507
the pie-eating contest, huh?

20:16.549 --> 20:19.052
Danny, we're really

20:16.549 --> 20:19.052
sorry we let you down.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.553
Hey, who would've

20:19.093 --> 20:20.553

20:20.594 --> 20:22.513
took out her

20:20.594 --> 20:22.513
dentures like that, that..

20:22.555 --> 20:25.099
She could gum down

20:22.555 --> 20:25.099
a pie that fast?

20:28.061 --> 20:29.311
Hey, everybody

20:28.061 --> 20:29.311
come down to the studio.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.771
I want you to check out

20:29.353 --> 20:30.771
this new new tune.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.858
- Okay.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.858
- Great.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.152
Alright, it's

20:33.900 --> 20:36.152
the world premiere of this tune.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.695
Don't know if the

20:36.194 --> 20:37.695
record company's gonna like it

20:37.737 --> 20:39.613
but I'm very proud of it.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.240
I'll tell

20:39.655 --> 20:41.240
you something. I, uh..

Couldn't have

20:41.281 --> 20:44.118
done it without you guys.
