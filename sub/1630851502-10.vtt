00:05.179 --> 00:06.832
- That's a lot of crawfish.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.357
- Just take 'em right down
to the water.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.968
We're gonna get wet.
- Oh, yeah.

00:12.012 --> 00:12.969
- I still don't
really understand

00:13.013 --> 00:14.449
why we're doing this.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.320
- This is a great food
for fish.

00:16.364 --> 00:17.713
- A bass, a bass just ate one.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.367
- So the bass
will eat all these?

00:19.410 --> 00:20.672
- Yeah.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.066
- Whoo-ie.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.415
- I feel like we should eat
some of this.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.156
- Look at the size
of these suckers.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.331
- I've seen bigger.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.985
It's so pretty.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.336
- Crawfish lives--they'll live
as long as 20 years.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.035
- Really?
- It's a baby!

00:35.078 --> 00:37.689
He's so small.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.082
Hey!

00:39.126 --> 00:40.649
You didn't even
let me say goodbye.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.477
- It's fish food, baby.
- I'm gonna go get another one.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.046
Pappy.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.048
- Oh! Oh, he'll bite.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.833
Oh! Whoo! He'll pinch me.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.748
Ow! Oh!

00:52.791 --> 00:54.097
- Got you.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.620
- Come on.

01:12.942 --> 01:17.599

01:17.642 --> 01:20.776
- Last year, Zurie, you won
your first title,

01:20.819 --> 01:23.692
and this year,
we're all gonna compete.

01:23.735 --> 01:26.303
Fun thing about this weekend
is you're going up

01:26.347 --> 01:29.263
against Gigi and me.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.655
All three of us
are going to show our horses.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.614
- I don't want you
go get run over.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.006
- I don't either.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.792
- We're showing at a horse show
in Athens, Texas.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.315
We're all really excited.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.926
This is kind of our first time
out this year to show,

01:40.970 --> 01:42.276
and Zurie's showing with us,

01:42.319 --> 01:44.147
so that makes it extra fun.
- Yeah.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.757
Showing horses is our business,

01:45.801 --> 01:48.499
so when we go to Athens
to show our palominos,

01:48.543 --> 01:50.110
if we do really good
down there...

01:50.153 --> 01:51.589
- Then we'll sell more babies.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.287
- We'll sell more babies,
that's it.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.463
- At a horse show, they're just
looking at their confirmation.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.899
How's the horse built?

01:56.942 --> 01:58.118
- From the hips to the hocks

01:58.161 --> 01:59.423
to the knees to the neck.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.470
It's like a dog show
except you don't trot,

02:02.513 --> 02:04.167
and you know, you don't run
around in circles.

02:04.211 --> 02:08.128
Seriously, this will be our
first show in almost a year.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.434
- This is my first time
since COVID.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.001
- I haven't shown
in three years.

02:12.044 --> 02:14.046
The last time Zurie showed

02:14.090 --> 02:16.136
was when
we went out there last year.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.702
- I think Zurie is showing
right now.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.313
You want to watch it?
- Yeah.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.662
- Look, she even
got his ears up.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.924
- I know.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.840
Oh, my God, that is
just dead solid perfect.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.408
- Perfect.
- She took the first place.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.410
Yay!

02:29.453 --> 02:33.762
Yay! Go Zurie!

02:33.805 --> 02:35.851
- And you know who I'm showing?
Sunny.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.201
- Oh, my gosh, well,
who am I showing?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.333
- Who do you wanna show?

02:39.376 --> 02:42.597
- I think you should
show Canoodle.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.207
- Macadoodle.
Macadoodle.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.817
- Macadoodle.
- Macadoodle.

02:45.861 --> 02:49.169
- And he should show the other
palomino mare you have.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.213
- Goldie?
- Goldie.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.475
- Yeah, Goldie.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.174
- Okay.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.349
- Let's just say if I win...

02:57.829 --> 02:59.962
You have to give me
a foot massage.

03:01.529 --> 03:04.532
- Look at that toenail.
- Oh, my God.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.664
- If I cut that toenail off...
- Get that off of my chair.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.884
- It would bounce off
of the floor.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.146
- I'm gonna puke.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.756
- That toenail weighs
about half a pound.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.193
- Oh, my God.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.542
- Okay, and if I win...

03:16.718 --> 03:19.460
You have
to get me a riding horse.

03:23.377 --> 03:26.206
- Mm-kay.
- You're on.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.511
It's on.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.339
- It's on, it can be
on all it want.

03:29.383 --> 03:33.256
<i>I'm telling you right now,
there's no way you'll beat me.</i>

03:33.300 --> 03:34.692
And if you think
'cause you're eight years old,

03:34.736 --> 03:36.999
I'm going to cut you
some slack,

03:37.042 --> 03:39.828
you got another thing coming.
You're history, girlfriend.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.794
Just breaking grub with my dog,
having a little rice.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.274
- I can't believe you're
letting him

03:51.318 --> 03:52.971
eat out of your bowl.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.234
- He's my boy.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.061
That half is his,
this half is mine.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.020
- And then you put the bowl
back in the cupboard

03:58.063 --> 03:59.543
'cause it's clean, right?

03:59.587 --> 04:02.851
- Look, he's got some stuck--

04:10.641 --> 04:12.426
- Hello.
- Hey, you.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.385
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I love your bag.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.517
- Thanks.
- Hello.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.258
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.216
- That's a Gucci bag.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.304
- How's it going?

04:21.348 --> 04:22.958
- Good.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.438
- Hello.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.178
<i>- Noah, the world's
greatest chef</i>

04:26.222 --> 04:27.963
has called a family meeting.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.486
Anybody want water?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.532
- I'll take one.
- I've got bourbon.

04:31.575 --> 04:32.620
- I'd love bourbon.
- Scotty, you want one?

04:32.663 --> 04:34.578
- Absolutely. Please.

04:34.622 --> 04:38.147
- Noah. What's up?
- Yes. We're very lucky.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.932
I have a great career in Hawaii
doing the catering,

04:40.976 --> 04:42.412
the private chef stuff.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.371
Unfortunately, I'm here
in Texas right now

04:44.414 --> 04:45.850
so that's all kind of on hold.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.331
- Hey, did you
say unfortunately?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.680
- Yeah.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.729
- You get to see me, though.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.034
- I do get to see all my
local family.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.514
- And you get to go
fishing every day.

04:57.558 --> 04:58.950
- It's great,
but that doesn't affect--

04:58.994 --> 05:00.300
it doesn't help my career
here at all.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.736
- True. <i>
- You know, I've worked</i>

05:01.779 --> 05:04.956
in restaurants in Hawaii
for over 20 years,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.959
and I've really established
myself there.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.788
<i>- He's a bad-ass.
He's really, really good.</i>

05:10.832 --> 05:12.790
- I would feel a lot better
moving to Texas

05:12.834 --> 05:14.923
if we had some steady income.

05:14.966 --> 05:15.967
- Yeah, I totally get it.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.360
That's why we have
the hot sauce.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.535
That'll be it.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.107
So I think that it is something
that could really take off,

05:25.150 --> 05:26.326
but I need everybody's help.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.936
- All right, what do you
need us to do?

05:27.979 --> 05:31.331
- Well, here's my plan.
We make a commercial.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.636
- Okay.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.813
- He's got experience
in the TV world.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.425
Scott, I'm just thinking he's
going to be like the model.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.643
- What?
- Yeah.

05:39.687 --> 05:40.818
- Whoo! He's got it.
- Oh, yeah.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.473
- Stop it.
- You do it.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.606
- We're going to put them
in assless chaps, yes.

05:45.649 --> 05:48.565
- Yes!
- No.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.394
- With flames on them.
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.700
- Sex sells, man.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.179
- Okay, let's go back
to your commercial.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.920
- Okay, so we're going to do
a commercial for your--

05:55.964 --> 05:57.444
- I think we should
do a commercial.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.097
- Okay. So--
- I've got a great product.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.143
We just need
to make it publicly known.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.536
- Really sell it.
- Yeah.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.756
- I'm jacked up about
Noah's chili water.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.759
If we can get that thing
going for him, chances are,

06:08.803 --> 06:13.198
it'll be easier
to go from Hawaii to Texas.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.635
- Yeah. Fingers crossed.

06:14.678 --> 06:15.853
- We should do shots
of it right now.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.507
- I love hot sauce,
I'll try it.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.074
- Chili pepper water.
- Yeah.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.902
Hawaiian chili pepper water,
it's very classic in Hawaii.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.817
Like we do--we take shots
of it at home all the time,

06:22.860 --> 06:25.689
but it's best
to put on top of food.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.519
- That is good.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.826
- It's good.
It's hot, but it's--

06:33.741 --> 06:36.831
- My stomach hurts
after taking that shot.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.876
It's like a cayenne cleanse.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.965
- You need a Tums
when you gotta drink that.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.532
- I need to drink
some milk now.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.881
- Dude, I love that.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.361
- Hangover cure
like every single time.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.493
- No way.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.504
- That's got a little kick
to it, my friend.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.157
- If I knew anything
about social media,

06:59.201 --> 07:01.812
a commercial like this
is going to blow up.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.466
- Yeah, I mean,
if it goes viral,

07:03.510 --> 07:05.642
you sell a bunch of hot sauce
and you make Texas your bitch.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.427
- Yeah.
Now I like the sound of that.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.125
- Come on, everyone, let's go
make a commercial for Noah.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.735
Hey, if you're going
to go buttless,

07:11.779 --> 07:13.433
we need to get your butt waxed.
- I'm not going buttless.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.305
No, I'm not. Uh-uh.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.438
No.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.881

Keep going, keep going.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.059
Whoa.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.626
- Having some trouble
back there?

07:32.669 --> 07:35.280
- May the best horse win.
- Yeah, it's gonna be me.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.368
- First of all,
you're not going to win

07:38.588 --> 07:41.896
great things happen
in the show ring.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.246
- Great disasters.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.602
- Come on, everyone,
let's go make a commercial.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.212
Come on, Noah.

07:54.256 --> 07:57.781
<i>I hired a film crew to come
and shoot the commercial.</i>

07:57.825 --> 07:59.130
<i>I'm directing.</i>

07:59.174 --> 08:01.002
I've never
directed anything in my life.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.612
Now, I've been
in a lot of commercials,

08:02.656 --> 08:07.574
so I've been directed
by hundreds of great directors.

08:07.617 --> 08:11.099
So I'm looking at as myself
as the Steven Spielberg

08:11.142 --> 08:13.449
of the chili water commercial.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.409
Let's get it all the way
through, I'm hungry.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.716
- Chef Noah's chili hot water.
Wait, what's it called?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.588
- Chili pepper water.
- Chef Noah's--

08:21.631 --> 08:24.547
- Chili water.
- Chili water. Take one.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.288
- Hello, America,
Terry Bradshaw here,

08:26.331 --> 08:27.985
and you know me from,
well, I guess

08:28.029 --> 08:32.033
my days of playing the NFL,
and I'm with my son-in-law.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.730
And we're here today
to introduce you

08:33.774 --> 08:36.777
to his new product,
Hawaiian Chili Water.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.214
Man, is this stuff hot.

08:39.257 --> 08:42.957
- How hot is it?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.567
Is it cowboy on a horse hot?

08:46.613 --> 08:49.006
- Cut. Where's Rachel?

08:49.050 --> 08:51.443
- Rachel, get out here!
- What are you waiting on it?

08:51.487 --> 08:54.011
- Rachel, get your little
wormy butt out here.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.579
- So much for hair.
- Sorry, guys.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.494
- Oh, that's tight.
Let's tighten it up.

08:58.538 --> 09:03.499
- Spielberg, Bradshaw,
sounds good to me.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.285
- I'll go buy
my Academy Award dress soon.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.418
- I would hold up on that.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.767
Hit it!

09:10.811 --> 09:13.248
- Chef Noah, Hawaiian
Chili Water, take five.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.336
Get it right.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.686
- This stuff is hot.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.046
I'm not big into acting.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.831
I just--it's not my thing.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.484

You're not helping.

Bingo. Rachel.

- Give us the smolder.

So awkward.

Zurie's got hers
perfectly set up.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.136
- To show a horse,
ears have to be up,

15:20.180 --> 15:24.184
back and front legs
have to meet like this,

17:17.862 --> 17:18.994
You know,

<i>- Seeing Zurie out there

17:24.956 --> 17:27.133

17:28.960 --> 17:30.440
I knew it was the thing for me,

17:30.484 --> 17:32.268

for me to think

17:32.312 --> 17:36.229

17:36.272 --> 17:37.534

there's a chance?

17:37.578 --> 17:41.843

17:50.243 --> 17:52.114
I know that you won the bet,

you're expecting a horse,

17:53.724 --> 17:55.291

until we decide

17:55.335 --> 17:58.903
if we're gonna live here
or in Hawaii permanently.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.644
- Okay, but if we do live
in Texas,

18:00.688 --> 18:02.559
can I keep the horse
in my room?

18:02.603 --> 18:04.083

that'll fit a horse.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.675
<i>- It's hotter.</i>

19:14.718 --> 19:16.851
- Is it two cowboys
riding on a horse hot?

19:18.374 --> 19:19.419
- Even hotter.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.552
- Hotter.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.338
<i>- So hot. So good.</i>

19:25.381 --> 19:29.037
Two cowboys riding in on
horses, playing the guitar,

19:29.080 --> 19:31.518
carrying a little tiny puppy hot.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.607
- It's hot.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.438
- It's so bad.
It's--I'm liking it.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.874
- It's so bad that it's good.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.876
- Funny. I mean, seriously.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.183
I want a copy
just so I can watch this.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.273
When I'm in a bad mood,
I'm putting this on.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.665
- It's meant to have, like,

19:48.709 --> 19:50.885
a little bit of like
entertaining cheese factor.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.192
- Seriously funny.
- I think it's good.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.497
America is gonna love it.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.761
- Hey, give the eagle a voice,
maybe like...

19:57.805 --> 20:00.590
"Ahh, it's Noah's hot sauce!

20:00.634 --> 20:02.897
"I just love it so much!

20:02.940 --> 20:05.900
I'm America Bald Eagle!
Whoosha."

20:05.943 --> 20:08.294
- I think we have
gone way off track.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.731
- Listen, is this going to help
sell a ton

20:10.774 --> 20:13.516
of chili pepper water?
I don't think so.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.736
But Noah thinks so,
and that's all that matters.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.346
- So what percentages
do we get?

20:17.390 --> 20:19.827
- Well, let's not talk
about percentages yet.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.743
I just really appreciate
that you guys took your time

20:22.786 --> 20:24.875
to be a part of this,
and like, it was fun.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.399
Not only was it
really fun to do,

20:26.442 --> 20:28.662
but I think having the family
involved will make it even

20:28.705 --> 20:30.185
more successful,
and I really appreciate it.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.840
<i>- This isn't about
the hot sauce,</i>

20:32.883 --> 20:35.277
this is just about us loving
and supporting Noah.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.670
Family came together,

20:36.713 --> 20:38.846
which is what you're supposed
to do as a family.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.327
We all gathered up,
rallied around Noah,

20:41.370 --> 20:45.113
and hopefully he and the family
will, you know, move to Texas

20:45.156 --> 20:47.637
so we can spend
more time together.

20:47.681 --> 20:48.943
Loving you big time
right now, bud.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.249
- It's pretty amazing.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.641
- Big move. Big move.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.252
<i>-
It's Noah's hot sauce!</i>

20:53.295 --> 20:54.818
<i>I love it so much!</i>

20:57.560 --> 21:00.259
<i>Family's about to head
off to Shreveport,</i>

21:00.302 --> 21:02.739
<i>going back to my hometown
and get the key to the city.</i>

21:02.783 --> 21:04.132
- Is that Pappy?
- Yeah.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.786
- Did you know that Pappy
was such a big deal?

21:05.829 --> 21:08.136
- Not this big.
- 410, right here.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.616
- That's the house
you grew up in, Dad?

21:09.659 --> 21:10.965
- That's it.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.923
I was raised in that house.
Fond memories.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.752
- That's not it?
- Dad, that's not it!

21:15.796 --> 21:16.840
- False alarm.
