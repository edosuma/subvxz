Only those worthy
of the thunder may wield Mjolnir, villain.

00:06.611 --> 00:08.812
By using the last Norn stone
you risk breaking down

00:08.846 --> 00:11.448
the walls to Muspelheim itself.

00:11.482 --> 00:15.685
This stone can protect me from
your magic. That's all that matters.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.623
The Twilight sword is gone.
The barriers to Muspelheim have fallen.

00:19.657 --> 00:21.791
Surtur has returned.

01:53.017 --> 01:57.131
It should be me entering
Muspelheim border, not Odin.

01:57.495 --> 02:00.330
He could be in battle
with Surtur this very moment.

02:00.364 --> 02:02.398
There was a time when
you would have welcomed this,

02:02.433 --> 02:04.467
for Odin to take such action.

02:04.502 --> 02:08.204
Perhaps. But the
tree of life is still healing,

02:08.239 --> 02:10.340
and Odin's powers are weakened.

02:10.374 --> 02:14.865
And Surtur, I dread to even say it.

02:14.910 --> 02:17.585
This may be a fight Odin cannot win.

02:17.616 --> 02:20.416
Who are we to question
the All Father's wisdom?

02:20.451 --> 02:25.455
Perhaps Odin does not deem me
worthy to fight by his side.

02:25.489 --> 02:29.395
Perhaps he knows that even
in the face of war with Surtur

02:29.430 --> 02:33.166
I find my thoughts on Midgard.

02:33.208 --> 02:36.065
Heimdall says there is still
no sign of the Enchantress.

02:36.099 --> 02:38.352
'Tis not Amora I think of.

02:38.371 --> 02:42.141
The Avengers are more than capable
of defending their world against her.

02:42.537 --> 02:47.566
But there was a mortal, Jane Foster.
It is troubling.

02:47.604 --> 02:52.580
I think of her, while here I feel like
a stranger among my own people.

02:55.085 --> 02:57.641
Then perhaps you should return there.

02:57.669 --> 02:58.907
Sif...

02:59.732 --> 03:01.373
Who are you?

03:01.452 --> 03:04.187
Because this is not
the warrior I knew...

03:04.227 --> 03:08.564
filled with doubt and fear,
longing for the company of mortals.

03:08.773 --> 03:10.474
I did not mean...

03:15.147 --> 03:16.447
Father.

03:16.477 --> 03:19.779
Surtur has indeed left Muspelheim.

03:20.077 --> 03:24.600
With the protective seals broken,
there was nothing to prevent his escape.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.528
I do not understand, My Lord.

03:26.541 --> 03:29.543
If this is the case, why
hasn't he attacked Asgard?

03:30.053 --> 03:31.892
I do not know,

03:31.923 --> 03:36.471
for somehow Surtur has
found a way to hide from my sight.

03:36.508 --> 03:40.156
Lord Odin,
we bring news from Heimdall.

03:40.309 --> 03:42.077
He has found something.

03:44.145 --> 03:45.525
Rest, Father.

03:46.188 --> 03:49.283
I will find out
what troubles Heimdall so.

03:50.073 --> 03:52.108
<i>There is a ship.</i>

03:52.142 --> 03:57.746
In the realm of Midgard.
It flies through the void.

03:57.781 --> 04:00.755
It emanates Surtur's evil.

04:00.809 --> 04:03.778
Odin will want to
investigate this personally.

04:03.987 --> 04:07.990
No. I will deal with this ship.

04:08.024 --> 04:10.860
My Prince?
Surely...

04:10.894 --> 04:14.786
Heimdall, I was not
here to protect Odin before,

04:14.818 --> 04:18.579
when he needed me.
Help me do this now.

04:26.009 --> 04:30.739
My sight will guide you
along Bifrost to this ship.

04:32.711 --> 04:34.324
Good hunting.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.681

05:57.033 --> 05:58.969
On your feet, demon!

05:58.980 --> 06:02.027
You have pursued me only to find death!

06:02.112 --> 06:05.895
What are you, creature?
What is your connection to Surtur...

06:13.504 --> 06:17.440
You are a fearsome creature,
but I will not fall so easily.

06:17.693 --> 06:20.629
- Surrender.
- Never, demon.

06:25.791 --> 06:29.525
I will give you once last
chance, monster. Surrender.

06:51.752 --> 06:54.222
Nay, that is not...

06:58.842 --> 07:01.338
Your weapon is mighty, demon.

07:01.377 --> 07:04.279
But now it belongs to Beta Ray Bill!

07:17.119 --> 07:19.567
There is no escape, demon!

07:19.617 --> 07:22.271
I do not fear
Mjolnir's power.

07:22.296 --> 07:24.213
Then fear me!

07:37.510 --> 07:40.582
Lord Odin, I bring troubling news.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.144
My brother Heimdall, he admitted to me

07:43.178 --> 07:45.984
that Thor has gone to
face Surtur's forces alone.

07:46.385 --> 07:47.740
No.

07:55.501 --> 07:58.034
You fought well, demon.

07:58.202 --> 08:00.741
But now it ends.

08:08.376 --> 08:10.410
What is that?

08:21.016 --> 08:23.084
Have at thee, monster!

08:26.288 --> 08:28.745
What manner of demon are you?

08:28.771 --> 08:30.629
Where is Thor?

08:31.654 --> 08:33.196
Where is my son?

08:33.261 --> 08:35.596
I summon Mjolnir's wielder
to Asgard!

08:42.369 --> 08:45.437
If you have harmed my son,

08:45.438 --> 08:48.976
you will pay
with your life.

08:49.710 --> 08:52.980
Heimdall!
Heimdall, hear me!

The creature's power is formidable.

09:14.312 --> 09:15.559
Father?

09:15.647 --> 09:18.698
You are concerned
for his safety,

09:18.747 --> 09:20.990
and he called you <i>son</i>.

09:21.243 --> 09:23.177
I do not understand.

09:23.212 --> 09:27.315
Your auras are similar to that of
the demons that torment my people.

09:28.130 --> 09:31.052
But your speech, your forms,

09:31.086 --> 09:34.255
you are nothing like the
screeching monsters I faced.

09:35.395 --> 09:39.026
- Demons?
- Aye, fire demons.

09:39.061 --> 09:41.473
I believe I know
what has happened here.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.094
This "Beta Ray Bill"...

09:44.181 --> 09:46.968
He mistook us for
Surtur's creatures.

09:47.002 --> 09:48.722
Perhaps to one such as him,

09:48.766 --> 09:52.340
all who wield
Asgardian magic look the same.

09:56.211 --> 10:00.114
Hear me, warrior.
I am Thor, son of Odin

10:00.148 --> 10:02.789
and Prince of this realm called Asgard.

10:02.824 --> 10:06.077
Tell us how did you come
to battle Surtur's forces?

10:07.821 --> 10:10.191
The Korbinite people built their cities

10:10.225 --> 10:13.160
<i>in the burning skies
from time immemorial,</i>

10:13.195 --> 10:17.064
<i>and danced in the sunlight
for ages, in harmony...</i>

10:17.099 --> 10:20.034
<i>until the demon breed came.</i>

10:20.068 --> 10:22.238
<i>The demons were relentless,</i>

10:22.239 --> 10:25.373
<i>stealing away my people
by the score.</i>

10:25.407 --> 10:28.299
<i>We were unprepared
for such an attack.</i>

10:28.399 --> 10:31.179
<i>And then, we saw it.</i>

10:31.556 --> 10:33.849
<i>Our star began to flare.</i>

10:34.081 --> 10:36.317
<i>We knew the end days
had come.</i>

10:36.351 --> 10:40.695
<i>With no other choice,
we were forced to flee our homeworld.</i>

10:41.596 --> 10:43.391
<i>They had little time.</i>

10:43.772 --> 10:48.296
<i>As many of the surviving Korbinites
as possible were placed in cold sleep.</i>

10:48.330 --> 10:51.410
<i>I was chosen to be the
guardian of my people,</i>

10:51.929 --> 10:53.992
<i>and underwent...</i>

10:54.282 --> 10:56.203
<i>Modification.</i>

10:56.531 --> 10:59.273
<i>I became Beta Ray Bill,</i>

10:59.308 --> 11:02.410
<i>the pinnacle of Korbinite
genetics and technology.</i>

11:03.099 --> 11:06.247
<i>Together, my ship,
Skuttlebutt, and I fled,</i>

11:06.810 --> 11:11.185
<i>only to find ourselves
pursued by the demon breed.</i>

11:11.800 --> 11:15.156
The fall of our world
wasn't enough for them.

11:15.434 --> 11:17.769
So, we hide...

11:17.844 --> 11:21.095
Until we can find a safe haven
for my people.

11:21.207 --> 11:24.098
Whatever this "Surtur" is,

11:24.132 --> 11:27.696
if he truly is responsible
for the end of Korbin,

11:27.821 --> 11:30.071
then I will find him.

11:30.105 --> 11:34.141
I will destroy him
with this hammer you call "Mjolnir".

11:34.518 --> 11:38.312
Nay. Mjolnir is Thor's
and Thor's alone.

11:38.628 --> 11:40.697
My Lord, I do not understand.

11:40.847 --> 11:43.284
How was this "Bill"
able to lift the hammer?

11:43.835 --> 11:46.120
The enchantment
allows only Thor to hold it.

11:46.526 --> 11:50.057
The enchantment allows
any who are worthy to wield it.

11:50.092 --> 11:53.474
Until now,
there has never been another.

11:53.849 --> 11:56.708
I have tested my might against Thor's.

11:56.764 --> 11:58.954
I will prove my worthiness.

11:59.047 --> 12:01.616
I will do anything
you require,

12:01.729 --> 12:06.248
for I have no other defense
against the power of these fire demons.

12:06.529 --> 12:10.978
Their numbers are
great, and I am but one.

12:11.012 --> 12:14.602
The fate of my
entire people rests on me.

12:14.858 --> 12:18.986
I will do what I must
to ensure their survival.

12:19.020 --> 12:21.989
Lord Odin, Bill's quest
is a noble one.

12:22.148 --> 12:23.749
He is a warrior,

12:23.792 --> 12:26.193
one that will fight for
his people to the end,

12:26.228 --> 12:28.129
no matter what.

12:28.163 --> 12:31.198
I would lend my sword
to your battle if you would have me.

12:31.233 --> 12:34.068
Hmm. I would be honored.

12:34.805 --> 12:39.521
If Mjolnir will save your people,
then take it.

12:41.143 --> 12:42.502
Thank you.

12:42.915 --> 12:47.081
My son, there is another way.

12:49.217 --> 12:51.309
You come to me for help?

12:51.727 --> 12:55.022
Where were the Asgardians
when Surtur escaped

12:55.056 --> 12:57.912
and burned my realm to the stone?

12:58.050 --> 13:00.499
Eitri, Odin himself
has sent us with...

13:00.537 --> 13:01.918
Odin?

13:02.205 --> 13:05.232
Odin promised
his protection.

13:05.267 --> 13:09.170
I held the shards
of Surtur's sword at Odin's request,

13:09.204 --> 13:12.239
and now my people have
paid bitterly for it.

13:12.724 --> 13:17.978
Perhaps I should have allied myself
with Ymir and the Frost Giants,

13:18.013 --> 13:19.501
or even Loki himself.

13:19.789 --> 13:24.018
Surtur is free, dwarf king,
and you would play games?

13:24.052 --> 13:28.022
All the nine realms will burn
if the fire demon is not stopped.

13:28.056 --> 13:33.027
So I ask you, in Odin's
name, will you help us?

13:34.396 --> 13:38.132
There is precious little Uru metal left,

13:38.166 --> 13:41.368
but to have the Odinson in my debt?

13:41.403 --> 13:44.028
It is worth it.

13:44.105 --> 13:47.007
What say you,
Prince of Asgard?

13:47.042 --> 13:51.045
One favor, at a time of my choosing.

14:03.992 --> 14:05.192
No.

14:08.964 --> 14:12.233
Your ship is under attack.
Come, Bill, to battle!

14:13.267 --> 14:16.203
Face the wrath of Stormbreaker!

14:46.878 --> 14:50.009
- The demon queen.
- Amora?

14:50.091 --> 14:54.128
- You know this woman?
- Aye, the Enchantress.

14:54.270 --> 14:58.373
A villain, to be sure,
but she's no ally of Surtur.

15:13.222 --> 15:15.559
Things change, it would seem.

15:20.391 --> 15:25.133
Amora, this is madness.
How can you be in league with Surtur?

15:25.168 --> 15:29.171
You are Vanir!
Good or evil, you believe in life.

15:29.205 --> 15:31.339
Surtur would see everything burn!

15:35.296 --> 15:38.398
Thor, please, help me.

15:41.031 --> 15:44.233
Tear them apart, and
bring me the hammers.

16:18.761 --> 16:21.005
Three three seven.

16:21.039 --> 16:23.587
<i> Champion

16:23.587 --> 16:25.867
<i>Welcome. I am Skuttlebutt.</i>

16:25.898 --> 16:28.217
I bring the word from Beta Ray Bill.

16:28.243 --> 16:30.410
Your people are in danger, Skuttlebutt.

16:30.464 --> 16:33.366
And we are going to
save them. Can you fly?

16:33.656 --> 16:37.042
<i> Yes.
Self repairs are 99% complete.</i>

16:37.073 --> 16:39.241
Then tell me of your weapons.

16:59.111 --> 17:01.766
There.
Head for the witch.

17:18.096 --> 17:20.458
<i> Warning.
Multiple hull breaches detected.</i>

17:20.490 --> 17:22.284
<i>Enemy demon breed have boarded.</i>

17:22.340 --> 17:24.035
<i>The Cold Sleep chamber is in jeopardy.</i>

17:24.069 --> 17:27.070
<i>The surviving
Korbinites are in jeopardy.</i>

17:27.105 --> 17:29.553
Guide me to the battle.

17:31.714 --> 17:32.877
<i>Skuttlebutt!</i>

17:32.908 --> 17:36.914
Bill, The Enchantress is the
power behind these demons.

17:36.949 --> 17:40.092
Defeat her, and the demons will fall!

18:40.432 --> 18:43.420
She is too powerful for either
of us to defeat separately.

18:43.444 --> 18:46.446
- But together...
- Together, then.

18:53.825 --> 18:57.211
If this is the end, so be it.

19:07.573 --> 19:10.841
- For Asgard!
- For Korbin!

19:40.906 --> 19:42.773
Surrender, Enchantress.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.086
Surrender, and
we can help you.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.931
Odin can help you.

19:49.170 --> 19:52.205
Please, finish it.

19:57.394 --> 20:00.530
<i>The Enchantress is beyond help now.</i>

20:06.585 --> 20:08.083
Your Enchantress...

20:08.084 --> 20:11.330
- Could she truly be gone?
- Nay.

20:11.385 --> 20:13.641
And while that was
the Enchantress,

20:13.666 --> 20:16.941
the words coming
out of her were those of Surtur.

20:16.975 --> 20:19.990
She is possessed by his power now.

20:20.946 --> 20:22.980
<i>Skuttlebutt. Sif!</i>

20:28.787 --> 20:31.455
- My people...
- Are safe.

20:33.759 --> 20:37.728
My friends, what I owe you
is immeasurable.

20:37.763 --> 20:40.345
All of Korbin owes you.

20:40.402 --> 20:43.665
Your people will
still require safe haven.

20:43.697 --> 20:47.567
I will travel with you.
You need not do this alone.

20:48.346 --> 20:52.638
I... I would
appreciate your aid,

20:52.676 --> 20:54.712
and your company,

20:54.746 --> 20:56.736
but I must refuse.

20:57.552 --> 21:00.495
With Stormbreaker,
I can protect my people.

21:00.819 --> 21:03.331
Your duties lie elsewhere.

21:03.689 --> 21:08.204
Indeed. The threat
of Surtur looms greater than ever.

21:08.285 --> 21:09.860
We must find him.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.830
We must discover
why he seeks the Korbinites,

21:12.864 --> 21:15.933
else the final battle
may consume us all.

21:16.845 --> 21:19.590
And when that battle
comes, brother,

21:19.603 --> 21:21.739
I will be at your side.

21:22.685 --> 21:24.436
Hyah!

21:24.461 --> 21:26.911
Good luck, Beta Ray Bill!

21:27.726 --> 21:30.966
I misjudged you, Thor.

21:31.548 --> 21:33.392
I did not understand

21:33.543 --> 21:37.502
what it meant to make a connection
with someone that needed you,

21:37.590 --> 21:40.212
like the mortals needed you.

21:40.254 --> 21:44.464
Truly, the worthiness found in mortal
heroes never ceases to surprise me.
