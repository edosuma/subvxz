01:48.609 --> 01:51.976
- You're so lying.
- What?

01:52.070 --> 01:54.982
Turn the music down, I can't hear you.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.780
I said you're so lying.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.075
No, I'm not.
I've read an article about it.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.242
When you're attracted
to someone, your pupils dilate,

02:02.289 --> 02:03.600
which makes your eyes look bigger,

02:03.624 --> 02:05.464
so it looks like you're,
like, more attractive.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.583
I don't know about you,
but I fuck with my eyes closed.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.285
Bite me, val.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.496
- Where?
- It's actually interesting.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.047
What magazine did you read this in?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.874
I read it in bop.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.334
Oh, she read it in bop,

02:17.429 --> 02:19.511
the preferred periodical
of intellectuals everywhere.

02:19.598 --> 02:20.867
Stop! Just let me tell you this.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.930
It goes back to, like, tribes in Africa
and how they would attract their mates.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.855
They'd paint their cheeks red
and their lips red, and accent their eyes,

02:29.941 --> 02:32.057
all just sort of play
with the men's subconscious

02:32.152 --> 02:33.796
to make them think
that they were turned on.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.735
Hold on. You're telling me that bop is
saying that makeup is, like, war paint?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.404
- For sex?
- Yeah.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.487
That's the whole point of makeup.
It's, like, ridiculous.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.245
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't
showered in two full days,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.855
- so I need to...
- That is truly disgusting.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.482
It's actually better
if you haven't showered.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.713
We're gonna get sweaty anyway,
everybody looks great.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.961
You know, it's fine.
You're gonna fit right in.

02:57.052 --> 03:00.340
How long until we stop?
Because I really have to pee again.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.173
What? You just peed 60 miles ago.
That was less than an hour.

03:04.267 --> 03:08.135
I have a weak bladder, Alexis.
Just pull over and I'll pop a squat.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.687
No. I'm not stopping.
You can hold it.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.934
I can't hold it.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.515
Well, stop drinking so much soda.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.602
We have a schedule.
My dad never pulled over for us.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.313
He used to make my brother pee
in a pickle jar.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.946
- What?
- What was going on in your family?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.368
Do you guys wanna hear what my dad did?

03:25.455 --> 03:29.368
- No.
- No. I can't go there right now.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.244
You guys are losers.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.829
Cooler than you.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.381
- In another life, bitch.
- Oh, not to be alarming,

03:38.468 --> 03:41.801
but there are no more ding dongs.
Zero, zilch, nada, none.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.129
Okay, fine. We'll stop
at the next gas station.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.464
Oh! Thank you, god.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.767
But if you aren't back by the time
the twinkies are in the car...

03:49.771 --> 03:50.811
We're leaving without you.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.347
- I get the front seat.
- That's right.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.436
Jj

04:37.486 --> 04:38.771
Stop.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.867
There is a scourge
on our society,

04:47.954 --> 04:49.114
my brothers and sisters.

04:49.206 --> 04:53.620
The evil that is heavy metal
rock music is resolute,

04:53.710 --> 04:58.374
steadfast, and unwavering in its goal
to corrupt our children's souls.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.172
Now, I know what you all are thinking.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.751
"Oh, but, pastor Butler,
it's just music, it's just..."

05:04.846 --> 05:06.256
Boo!

05:07.891 --> 05:11.224
Damn, bev. Spooked much?

05:12.729 --> 05:16.017
This is supposed to scare
other people, not us.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.768
I guess.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.397
Means that they will
come to you in sheep's clothing...

05:21.488 --> 05:22.488
Getting this.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.403
But inwardly,
they are ferocious as wolves.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.449
Hi. Just wanna get this.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.032
And then...

05:32.123 --> 05:33.203
And the gas.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.828
Yeah. Thank you.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.036
Oh, my god.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.293
- And these.
- Seriously? Why?

05:42.384 --> 05:45.672
- Where's your fourth of July spirit?
- Whatever.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.252
7548.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.964
But there is a path to victory.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.516
Join me in this fight, it is not too late.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.845
Your donations
will incinerate these demons

05:56.940 --> 05:59.226
and send them back to the hell
from whence they came.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.757
Hallelujah.

06:01.736 --> 06:05.194
To those of you who
doubt my message, I say this...

06:08.535 --> 06:10.696
- You girls be careful now.
- Why?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.699
You don't think
we can fend for ourselves?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.156
There's a lot of evil out there,

06:16.251 --> 06:18.788
and you seem like nice girls, is all.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.541
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.497
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.960
Jj

06:36.354 --> 06:37.844
What are you doing? Stop.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.500
Traffic due to construction.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.462
Police came across
another grisly murder scene last night.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.256
Wait. I wanna hear that.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.300
What are you doing? Stop.
Go back. I wanna listen to that.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.487
Three youths found stabbed
to death inside a suburban home.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.068
The walls covered in satanic symbols.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.994
This brings the death toll to 18

06:55.081 --> 06:58.039
in what many believe to be
the workings of a satanic cult

06:58.126 --> 07:00.492
burning their way
through America's heartland.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.454
Famed televangelist,
pastor John Henry Butler,

07:03.548 --> 07:06.255
denounced the murders today
on his nationally syndicated program.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.255
- Let's just change it.
- Listen. Just relax. Be cool.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.146
Let's change it,
I don't wanna listen to this.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.342
- Just relax, Beverly.
- You're such a baby.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.309
Fine. Whatever you want.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.518
That's better.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.155
- Oh, my god.
- What is that?

07:34.245 --> 07:36.827
Pull over. Alex, pull over.
Oh, my god.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.995
Damn it.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.745
Damn it. Fuck!

07:45.840 --> 07:48.377
- Jerkoff!
- Fuck you, asshole!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.583
Hey! Fuckhead!

07:49.678 --> 07:52.465
- Fuck! Damn it!
- Fuck.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.136
- Ew.
- What is it?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.512
Don't touch it.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.481
It's a chocolate milkshake.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.149
It's a chocolate milkshake!

08:07.237 --> 08:08.714
- Okay.
- Can I have...

08:08.738 --> 08:10.007
- Here. Use this.
- Yeah. Thank you.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.239
This is disgusting.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.816
- This isn't...
- Is now the time?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.073
Val, just hurry up and help.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.826
- Don't give that to me.
- Val? Can you help?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.453
What am I supposed to do?

08:22.544 --> 08:26.002
As if val's gonna touch this.
She's not gonna do shit.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.124
Oh, my god.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.402
- Just use the windshield wipers.
- Just let me see if...

08:29.426 --> 08:32.714
- I just got my nails done.
- This is actually making it worse.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.164
- This is making it worse.
- Just use the windshield wipers.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.260
I don't understand
what's wrong with people.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.558
- That's fine.
- Okay. That's working.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.135
Okay. Come on, val.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.084
Don't light a cigarette.
We're leaving now.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.190
Oh, it's so stressful.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.485
- It's fine. Get in, val.
- People are nuts.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.105
At least it's not shit.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.864
Hey!

09:02.959 --> 09:06.076
- Fuck, yeah, baby!
- Yeah!

09:06.171 --> 09:07.877
Here we are.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.875
- Okay. No. Sorry, no.
- Do you guys have extra tickets?

09:12.969 --> 09:14.569
Please tell me you have an extra ticket.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.628
- No. No. No.
- No?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.259
- We're driving away now.
- Jeez.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.358
Oh, yeah!

09:30.445 --> 09:32.652
Beverly, please do not
slow us down today.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.739
I'm coming.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.315
- Val?
- Yeah?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.070
Can you do the honors?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.196
Sure.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.403
- I want no part.
- For sure.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.908
Beverly, you have to.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.955
- This is my favorite part.
- No, I...

09:45.043 --> 09:46.624
- Beverly.
- I don't drink anymore.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.667
We're drinking together,
it's liquid courage.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.291
- Take the cup.
- Just drink it.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.622
Put it to your mouth.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.503
Put it in your throat.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.336
We're not gonna tell anyone.
It'll be like it never happened.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.011
- Drink.
- That's not the point.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.259
Drink the drink.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.638
Cheers to a night that we're gonna
remember for years to come.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.844
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.224
Cheers.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.522
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.815
Ah.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.852
Mm!

10:15.323 --> 10:17.359
- That was enough anyway.
- It's sharp.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.157
Ready? Pull that down.

10:20.245 --> 10:24.113
Oh. My ring's stuck in my hair.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.103
Don't sell your souls
for rock 'n' roll.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.604
Oh, my god. Look at this guy.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.744
- Guys.
- Yeah, guys.

10:30.839 --> 10:31.954
Is that that Van?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.808
- Oh, my god.
- It is the Van.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.498
I et's teach them some manners.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.904
Do we knock on the door?

10:36.928 --> 10:38.697
Have you lost your mind?
That is a horrible idea.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.721
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.784
- They're in there.
- Stay there.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.369
- Val, I swear to god...
- What are you doing?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.508
Shut up.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.854
Oh. Yes.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.102
Shit.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.147
This is a horrible idea.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.823
No, wait, wait, wait.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.072
- Oh, fuck!
- Jesus!

11:04.164 --> 11:06.576
Fuck! Fuck!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.281
Fuck!

11:08.376 --> 11:09.661
Jesus!

11:09.752 --> 11:11.617
Oh!

11:11.713 --> 11:13.999
Happy fourth of July, dickwads!

11:16.509 --> 11:18.069
- The fuck was that?
- Impressive.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.008
What the fuck is funny about this?

11:23.099 --> 11:25.932
I don't know. Were you driving
on route 9 this morning?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.555
Yeah. So what?

11:27.645 --> 11:30.352
So payback's a bitch, isn't it?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.055
What the hell are you talking about?

11:32.150 --> 11:34.516
You threw a milkshake at our window.
We could've died.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.943
- Shit.
- Oh.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.270
That was you?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.092
Don't throw your trash
out of a moving car, man.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.572
Come on, it was just messing around.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.803
It doesn't give you a right
to mess up our car.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.034
Well, whatever. It wasn't cool.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.952
Listen. We're assholes. We're sorry.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.622
- We didn't mean to scare you.
- Who said we were scared?

11:49.709 --> 11:53.543
Look. What I think my friends
are trying to say is...

11:55.173 --> 11:58.631
Maybe... we can make it up to you.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.381
- We're not interested.
- Wow, interesting.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.679
Oh, come on. Make me an offer.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.308
Do you have any more pabst?

12:10.480 --> 12:14.223
Full case. Among other assorted fun items.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.229
All right. Fire away.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.278
Here we go. Watch out.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.360
Thanks.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.935
- Oh, Jesus.
- There we go.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.328
Oh, just sprayed it on you.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.450
Hilarious.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.125
By the way, I'm Ivan.
And it's a pleasure to meet you.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.702
Mark.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.583
Kovacs. What's up?

12:37.674 --> 12:43.010
I'm, um, Alexis,
and this is val and Beverly.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.429
So, what, were you guys in the middle
of a circle jerk or something?

12:46.516 --> 12:47.516
Oh, hell yeah.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.261
- Just finished up.
- Yeah.

12:49.352 --> 12:53.186
You guys wanna see my bong?
It's like...

12:53.273 --> 12:55.389
Rock on, dude.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.145
These guys fucking suck.
Let's get out of here, please.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.942
- I wanna go.
- Okay.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.317
- We were just about to light up a hippie.
- Where are you going?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.820
- Yeah. Okay.
- Hey, Beverly.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.946
Shit. Just go.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.619
All right, hippie fucks.
You ready for soldiers of Satan?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.789
- Yes.
- Yes, fucking sure.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.915
- Fourth show we've seen on this tour.
- Four?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.917
Yeah. We just actually saw them
in Cleveland.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.791
Caravanning, it's nice.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.539
I thought only deadheads did that.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.625
Oh, no, fuck those granolas.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.005
We do it differently.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.927
Are you guys in a band or something?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.325
- Mm-hmm.
- We were.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.681
- Mark here's moving out to la.
- Mm-hmm.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.508
Mark?

13:32.603 --> 13:35.140
It's true. Ditching our asses.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.813
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm talking true, man. Sorry.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.110
What's your axe?

13:40.194 --> 13:41.809
Uh, drums.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.065
Bass, synth, sometimes backing vocals.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.615
And I am the front man.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.693
And woo!

13:50.830 --> 13:51.910
Wow.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.245
That's not creepy at all.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.416
What?

13:58.629 --> 14:00.494
Oh, yeah.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.297
Fucking first the backwards songs.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.421
Now satanic ritual murders.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.046
What will they come up with next?

14:10.141 --> 14:11.802
How many people have been killed now?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.758
- It's 15.
- Hmm.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.220
Uh, no, you know,
I'm pretty sure it was 12.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.148
Yeah. But after last night, it's 15.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.099
Uh, no. After last night, it's 12.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.312
Uh, you know, you would be right if you
knew how to fucking count,

14:25.406 --> 14:26.612
'cause you'd know it was 15.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.135
- That's the number that it is.
- Last night was 10. It's 12...

14:28.159 --> 14:29.319
- It's 18.
- It's...

14:31.746 --> 14:34.328
Remember the three they killed
in Tallahassee last week?

14:34.415 --> 14:37.452
- Oh.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.953
Eighteen, dude. Come on.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.624
You know what you and I should do?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.922
What? Me and you?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.672
Have you shotgunned a beer before?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.300
You can teach me if you want, though.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.473
Is that a doublehead back patch?

14:53.559 --> 14:57.302
- Yeah. It was my first concert.
- No way.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.230
Yeah. Straight to Hades tour,
I had to sheak out.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.307

- Um, ozzy.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.448
- Diary of a madman.
- No way.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.366
It was Randy rhoads's last show.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.489
- Oh, shit! Yeah.
- Oh, before he quit?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.242
Like, uh, died in a plane crash.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.494
Right. Yeah. It was a bummer.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.168
Alexis, what was your first show?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.293
Um, god, it's been so long.
I don't think I can remember...

15:26.384 --> 15:29.421

15:43.526 --> 15:45.170
Gotta fucking do it,
you always gotta go there.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.714
And his mom chaperoned the whole time.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.465
Every fucking time we have
this conversation.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.400
First of all, go fuck yourself, okay?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.027
- Well, I'm sorry.
- And second of all,

15:52.118 --> 15:55.347

good songs, so let's not write them off.

Shit. Come on, the night's young.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.738
Why don't we keep the party going?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.531
Depends on what you have in mind.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.824
Well, let's hit a bar.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.573
- Can't be too hard to find.
- Are you kidding me?

18:01.664 --> 18:04.155
There's no bars.
There's, like, 7-elevens and dairy queens.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.367
We could, uh...

18:08.462 --> 18:10.669
- We could hang in the Van?
- The Van. Yeah.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.963
As appealing as that...

18:13.050 --> 18:15.507
- It sounds nice.
- Just give us one second.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.586
I'm just gonna...

18:17.680 --> 18:19.671
With these stupid jokes,
they're gonna be, like,

18:19.765 --> 18:22.006
"he's mysterious.â that's the whole thing.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.841
Let's just bring it down a notch.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.269
They're kind of perfect, and the little
drummer boy is totally into you, Beverly.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.688
Yeah. I was thinking that.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.060

18:59.805 --> 19:01.116

I swear to god, I'm gonna just cut him up,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.536

Ahem. Oh.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.984
Oh, my god.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.276

20:43.367 --> 20:45.232
- Oh, wow. Nice.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.763

Get her in there.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.833

21:05.723 --> 21:06.838
Sorry.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.514
So, that's the living room,
obviously.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.514
This is the dining room,
kitchen, bedrooms upstairs,

21:12.605 --> 21:14.015
so you can go anywhere you want.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.347
Whoa, so your dad owns this place?

21:16.442 --> 21:17.648
What is he, a. Busch?

21:17.735 --> 21:18.850
The vice president?

21:18.944 --> 21:21.435
No, fool. The beer, busch.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.281
Holy shit.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.752
We'll take the party out there.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.704
(Go outside.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.381
It's really nice in the backyard.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.629
- Just take them outside.
- I got it. Yeah.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.181
Good god. What did we do
to deserve this shit?

21:55.105 --> 21:56.811
Oh, yeah.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.561
Well, it's not like
fucking hair metal bands

21:59.652 --> 22:02.735
like twisted sister, fucking motley crue.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.406
It's fucking metallica,
it's fucking slayer. It's, uh...

22:06.492 --> 22:09.234
Dude, metallica has never recovered
since Dave mustaine left.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.472
And I don't care who says it.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.641
- He didn't leave, he was fired.
- Okay, whatever.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.031
But if mustaine never left,
we'd never get megadeth.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.956
- Yeah?
- Forget mustaine, dude.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.753
How are they ever gonna replace cliff?
He's such a cutie.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.567
- Oh, yes.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.918

22:27.012 --> 22:29.549
Whoever he is,
he's got some big shoes to fill

22:29.640 --> 22:33.428
because cliff was a goddamn genius.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.913
I guess we'll find out soon, right?

22:34.937 --> 22:37.804

- Right.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.459
So, come on.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.332
Let's get this party started.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.673
I et's do it!

24:46.151 --> 24:47.391
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my god.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.896
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.148
- Fuck.
- Sorry.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.524
Sh... um, here, I'll...

24:53.492 --> 24:54.492
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.113
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.911
- Sorry. Smells like shit now.
- No, that's okay.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.535
Here, it's a bit cold.
Take mine.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.707
- No, it's all right.
- No, please, take mine.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.409
Thanks.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.497
Looks better on you than me.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.970
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry. I'll take that.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.972
It's my brother's.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.933
You want me to help you make more or...

25:26.025 --> 25:28.858
Um, no, that's enough. They'll be okay.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.443
Fuck.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.399
Cute.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.079
You see that? That was fucking nice.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.876
Such a fucking romantic.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.705
Hey. I come bearing gifts.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.167
- This is for you.
- Why, thank you.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.503
You're welcome, handsome boy.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.634
One for you.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.386
Oh, thank you. What is this?

26:01.477 --> 26:03.308
- Family recipe.
- Family recipe?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.306
Hey.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.479
- Hey.
- Hey, this is for you.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.477
- All right.
- Yeah.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.774
Oh, thank you.

26:10.861 --> 26:13.068
Hey, bev. What's your problem?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.986
- He has a switchblade.
- So?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.317
He has a fucking switchblade.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.073
Stop being so paranoid.
It's not like he's gonna murder us.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.654
Just relax.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.208
All right, everyone. A toast!

26:28.295 --> 26:30.065
- All right.
- A toast. A toast.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.329
- Woo!
- Yes!

26:31.423 --> 26:34.210
Let the madness begin. Ah...

26:34.301 --> 26:35.757
- Cheers!
- To madness!

26:35.844 --> 26:38.586
- Madness! Hear, hear.
- Cheers!

26:38.680 --> 26:41.797
- Cheers!
- Rock 'n' fucking roll. Yeah.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.507
- And your mom.
- Cheers.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.433
Woo!

26:47.648 --> 26:50.355
Mm. Yow!

26:51.985 --> 26:55.068
Okay. You guys
wanna play a game?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.646
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.777
What kind of game?

27:01.537 --> 27:03.869
Have you ever played never have I ever?

27:03.956 --> 27:06.993
No. I have never played
never have I ever.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.575
- Does that mean I win?
- No.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.831
No, you idiot.

27:11.922 --> 27:16.916
Basically, you just go around in a circle
and you say, "never have I ever,"

27:17.010 --> 27:19.251
and then you say something
that you haven't done.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.711
And then if you've done the thing

27:20.806 --> 27:24.139
the other person says
that they haven't, you drink.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.386
Does that make sense?

27:26.395 --> 27:27.475
- Sounds good.
- Cool.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.266
I'm, like, so confused right now.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.544
It's okay, it's easy. I'll go
and then you'll pick it up.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.025
If you don't understand, I'll...
You'll figure it out.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.773
Bev, sit down.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.822
I don't... I don't need to play.
I'll just watch, you guys can...

27:39.908 --> 27:41.614
- Bev.
- Bullshit.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.239
Everybody's got to play. Play.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.910
Come on, play.

27:45.998 --> 27:50.162
Play, play, play, play!

27:50.252 --> 27:51.913
Sit down and play.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.916
- Play, play, play, play!
- Jesus Christ!

27:58.010 --> 27:59.090
So...

28:00.387 --> 28:04.380
Never have I ever... gone streaking.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.591
- Oh, shit.
- Ivan. Drink up.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.677
Yeah. I'm gonna be drunk
in about five minutes.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.433
- Yeah. You and me both, baby.
- Oh.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.731
- All right. Mark, you go.
- Okay.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.529
Never have I ever...
Spent the night in jail.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.607
Oh, come on, man.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.864
That's just messed up.
You can't just target people.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.239
Heh.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.331
You too?

28:34.254 --> 28:37.462
I was, uh, drunk and...
Disorderly.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.921
- What were you in for?
- Shoplifting.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.845
Shopliftingâ? What? Clothes or...

28:45.849 --> 28:46.964
Food.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.141
Food?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.559
Come on, if I could, like...

28:50.646 --> 28:52.762
Kovacs, drop it.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.519
Ivan, you go.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.397
Uh, yeah. Uh...

28:59.488 --> 29:01.069
Never have I ever...

29:02.741 --> 29:06.074
No, did that. Um, all right.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.324
Never have I ever...

29:09.414 --> 29:10.529
Pissed my pants.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.536
Oh, val.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.163
I got a weak bladder.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.417
That was an insane night.
You remember?

29:18.507 --> 29:22.045
Wait, wait, careful.
We don't want another accident.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.671
All right, what do you got, val?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.430
Never have I ever hurled in a church.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.098
Ooh.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.247
- That's what you went with?
- That's you, baby.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.683
- Yeah. Drink up.
- No!

29:34.773 --> 29:38.140
Okay. I'm gonna need
a lot of fucking details.

29:39.569 --> 29:43.312
Did you just go, like, full exorcist,
just spraying pea soup everywhere?

29:43.407 --> 29:44.897
I was sick.

29:44.992 --> 29:48.029
I mean, it's boring.
I had a... I had a stomach flu.

29:50.372 --> 29:53.455
- Head spinning.
- She was really sick.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.703
It's kind of boring and stupid.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.522
Did you spin your head
around a few times

29:57.546 --> 29:59.537
and just say, "fuck me, fuck me, fuck me"?

29:59.631 --> 30:00.711
That's dumb.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.882
I mean, I'm not the first person
to get the stomach flu.

30:03.969 --> 30:04.969
- Kovacs.
- Oh, me?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.714
- Yeah. It's your turn.
- Oh, I have one.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.889
Um, never have I ever decided
to ditch my friends

30:10.976 --> 30:14.594
and go to California
to become a fucking rock star.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.054
Oh, fuck you.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.186
Fuck you, Mark. Drink up.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.313
That's a low blow, man. Come on.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.646
Sorry, was that too much or...

30:25.741 --> 30:27.402
Hitting him hard.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.459
- Alex.
- Mm?

30:42.549 --> 30:44.835
Do you think you can top that one?

30:44.926 --> 30:46.837
Yeah, I think I can top that one.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.342
Never have I ever...

30:51.433 --> 30:53.970
Drugged someone's drink.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.643
Yeah. Uh, not me.

30:56.730 --> 31:00.222
Yeah. That's fucked up,
is what that is.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.735
Oh. Oh.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.406
- Fuck off.
- You gotta be kidding me.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.109
Seriously?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.490
No.

31:17.793 --> 31:18.828
Drink up, bev.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.702
Oh, no shit.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.545
Okay. Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:24.633 --> 31:29.468
So you're saying, like, all three of you

31:29.554 --> 31:32.842
have drugged somebody's drink
at some point?

31:37.854 --> 31:40.061
Okay. Like whose? Why?

31:46.822 --> 31:49.234
Oh, no. Oh, it's us?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.982
I don't buy that for one fucking second.

31:52.077 --> 31:57.037
Ladies, you don't have to drug our drinks
to... have sex with us.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.490
I mean...

31:59.584 --> 32:03.202
Oh, you didn't think that we're gonna
have sex with you, did you?

32:04.965 --> 32:06.876
What?

32:06.967 --> 32:08.707
You did.

32:08.802 --> 32:12.169
Oh, that's so precious.
That's really sweet.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.632
I mean, why would you think that
we were gonna have sex with you?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.676
- Okay, uh...
- Okay, uh...

32:21.106 --> 32:22.812
I'm sorry we were...

32:22.899 --> 32:27.734
Things just got really
fucking weird, so, uh...

32:29.239 --> 32:31.321
I'm gonna have to bid you ladies
a good evening

32:31.408 --> 32:33.364
and thank you for all of your hospitality.

32:33.452 --> 32:37.286
And, uh, we're gonna...
We're gonna have... kovacs?

32:37.372 --> 32:39.203
- Okay. Go for it.
- Mark!

32:40.792 --> 32:42.783
Mark, what the... Mark!

32:44.129 --> 32:48.122
- Mark? Mark?
- Is he not waking up?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.878
Oh, no. Oh!

32:52.804 --> 32:55.420
- Ivan. No.
- Oh.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.473
- He's...
- Oh, no.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.222
- Ivan.
- You should go check on him.

33:02.439 --> 33:05.021
- You should wake him up.
- Oh, gosh. Oh, no.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.348
Ivan.

33:06.443 --> 33:09.685
Dude, fucking... okay.
What the fuck did you do to him?

33:12.824 --> 33:15.031
- What's happening?
- Uh, Mark?

33:15.118 --> 33:17.154
- Are you tired?
- Mark.

33:18.955 --> 33:24.040
- Oh, you poor baby. Honey.
- Are you okay?

33:24.127 --> 33:28.086
- Are you tired?
- Me and you together forever.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.788
Are you asleep?

33:29.883 --> 33:32.169
Oh, I think you're asleep.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.226
Jj

33:57.202 --> 33:59.693
- Bev, bev.
- Mm-hmm.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.613
- The bucket.
- Yeah.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.670
Is she gonna be able to do this?

34:11.757 --> 34:13.873
She'd better be able to.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.812
What are you doing?

34:35.824 --> 34:37.234
Let's go.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.985
Let's fuckin' go.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.543
Here.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.370
Get it together, Beverly.

35:10.942 --> 35:11.942
Hello, boys.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.561
Hello, boys.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.772
- Good morning, baby.
- How are you?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.698
Baby.

35:23.038 --> 35:25.324
I don't know
what kind of fucked up game is this,

35:25.415 --> 35:27.827
but it's got to stop right now.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.954
I'm so sorry, I can't do that for you.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.161
And it's not a game.

35:36.259 --> 35:40.298
Holy shit. You're the fucking cult.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.221
What?

35:43.308 --> 35:44.764
Listen, just let us go.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.558
We'll drive away
and you'll never see us again.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.558
That would be a good idea
if I hadn't slashed your tires

35:50.649 --> 35:53.482
while you were passed out.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.645
Help! Help!

35:57.739 --> 35:59.070
- Fucking help us!
- Help us!

35:59.157 --> 36:00.797
- Fucking psychos!
- Help!

36:00.825 --> 36:02.486
- "Help!"
- Help!

36:02.577 --> 36:04.693
Somebody fucking help!

36:06.915 --> 36:09.406
- Somebody!
- They're fucking psychos!

36:09.501 --> 36:11.583
Try a little louder, honey.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.877
- You poor babies.
- Please.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.295
I'm so sorry, boys.

36:17.759 --> 36:20.375
But we haven't been completely
honest with you.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.129
The truth is...

36:26.059 --> 36:28.141
We don't care about any of this shit.

36:29.145 --> 36:33.388
Heavy metal and satanic cults,
devil worship.

36:33.483 --> 36:37.726
It's all really just
a giant crock of shit to me.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.436
So, you're not a satanic cult?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.738
Well, what the fuck is all of this, then?

36:42.951 --> 36:46.364
Is it fun being so stupid?

36:46.454 --> 36:50.868
You're killing people and making
it look like a satanic cult.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.199
Exactly.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.035
Color me impressed.
You must be the smart one.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.712
You killed all those people?

36:57.799 --> 37:01.542
No, actually those were the other members
of our congregation.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.297
Mm-hmm. But tonight's our turn.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.199
And then next week it'll be
another group's turn,

37:05.223 --> 37:07.535
and then the week after that,
it'll be another group's turn.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.426
Our reach is very far and very wide.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.684
And we're growing stronger every single
day, thanks to people like you.

37:14.774 --> 37:18.392
- You're so fucking clueless.
- Oh. We're clueless?

37:18.486 --> 37:21.193
Because we're not the one's tied up
to chairs right now, are we?

37:21.281 --> 37:22.521
We're not devil worshipers.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.822
- Yeah. No, no, no, no.
- None of us are.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.240
Don't you get it?

37:26.327 --> 37:30.195
- We don't give a fuck who you are.
- No, we don't.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.030
You dress the part and you look the part,

37:32.125 --> 37:33.990
and the news is gonna fill in
the rest for us.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.370
Yeah. They always do.

37:35.462 --> 37:39.046
And then when the public hears
there's been another satanic murder...

37:40.383 --> 37:44.376
They're gonna come to us for salvation,
because they want their souls saved.

37:44.471 --> 37:47.133
You sick fucks.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.963
So, what, are you just murdering people?

37:49.058 --> 37:53.051
And then you're just gonna fucking lie
to the whole country about it?

37:53.146 --> 37:55.432
It doesn't matter if it's true.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.229
It only matters if people believe it.

37:57.317 --> 37:58.807
And, boy, do they believe it.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.063
And the beautiful thing is

38:01.154 --> 38:03.691
that your deaths are actually
gonna mean something.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.070
Like, your deaths are actually gonna save
the lives of hundreds,

38:07.160 --> 38:08.570
if not thousands of people.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.822
Like, think about it.

38:10.914 --> 38:15.078
Who can say these days that they died
for a good cause and for a good reason?

38:16.085 --> 38:18.701
You sound just like that asshole
preacher, John Henry Butler.

38:19.714 --> 38:23.252
You shut the fuck up,
you little piece of shit.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.044
Hey.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.049
Why don't you do me a favor?

38:29.140 --> 38:32.052
Why don't you explain to me
what this silly little thing is?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.303
Hmm?

38:34.312 --> 38:35.768
It's a means of expression.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.062
And what are you trying to express?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.434
Defiance.

38:40.443 --> 38:41.979
Against what?

38:45.031 --> 38:47.147
I asked you a fucking question.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.034
Against what?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.576
People like you.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.871
On?

38:54.958 --> 38:59.577
People like us? People like us,
who are trying to help people.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.413
People like us who are trying
to spread Christ's word.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.920
We're trying to spread the word
of our lord and savior.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.922
Good people trying to help the world.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.753
That's... that's what's wrong?

39:10.849 --> 39:12.827
- That's what's wrong with us?
- It means that people

39:12.851 --> 39:15.012
are just closed-minded,
ignorant fuckheads

39:15.103 --> 39:16.503
who just go around their whole life

39:16.563 --> 39:18.243
shitting on anything
they don't understand!

39:18.273 --> 39:19.604
- Ivan, stop.
- Shut up.

39:19.691 --> 39:23.559
What he means is hypocritical,
lying, fucking pieces of shit

39:23.653 --> 39:25.693
- that invent a belief system...
- Shut the fuck up!

39:25.738 --> 39:27.842
80 they can persecute anyone
who stands up against them.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.572
- Shut the fuck up!
- What he means

39:29.659 --> 39:30.819
is a fucking weak...

39:30.910 --> 39:32.616
- Shut the fuck up!
- Cowardly sheep

39:32.704 --> 39:35.182
that has no original ideas of his own,
who just blindly follows anyone

39:35.206 --> 39:37.206
who's the first person to blow
in the fucking wind!

39:37.250 --> 39:39.741
Fuck, fuck!

39:39.836 --> 39:42.168
Fuck! Fuck!

39:44.924 --> 39:48.382
No, don't! God! Fuck!

39:49.846 --> 39:52.087
You fuckers!

39:55.727 --> 39:57.558
Told you to stop talking.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.684
Oh, no! Oh, god! Oh, fuck!

40:05.486 --> 40:07.351
That's much better.

40:08.907 --> 40:13.367
And you, you're not
so defiant now, are you?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.994
Nothing left to be
defiant about, is there?

40:22.545 --> 40:24.206
Beg for forgiveness.

40:24.297 --> 40:27.710
Please. Please.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.963
Beg for Christ's forgiveness
before I kill you.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.047
Don't you want forgiveness
from our lord and savior?

40:42.899 --> 40:45.060
So be it.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.561
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, wait, wait!

40:46.653 --> 40:48.609
Jesus fucking Christ.
What the hell, Beverly?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.402
I need to talk to you for a second.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.605
About what?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.781
- Beverly, shut the fuck up!
- For a second.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.733
For a fucking second!
For a second, okay?

40:55.828 --> 40:56.948
Can we talk in the bathroom?

40:57.038 --> 40:59.199
I'm listening!
I can hear you from right here.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.201
They're not going anywhere.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.783
I knew you're gonna do
some shit like this.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.960
So go! Go! Go!

41:09.050 --> 41:11.257
Fucking hell.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.921
They just killed him, man.
They fucking killed him.

41:17.016 --> 41:20.884
Kovacs, look at me.
You got to keep it together, okay?

41:20.979 --> 41:22.219
You got to keep it together.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.599
Well, then what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

41:26.067 --> 41:27.728
You see my belt over there?

41:27.819 --> 41:30.356
Do you see my belt?

41:30.446 --> 41:33.062
Can you get it? Can you get to it?

41:33.157 --> 41:35.068
See if you can cut the tape
with the spikes.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.399
Fuck.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.571
What?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.416
- I wanna do it.
- What?

41:45.503 --> 41:46.993
I et me kill them.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.122
Get the fuck out of here.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.831
No, I'm... I'm serious.

41:52.844 --> 41:53.884
When I heard them talking,

41:53.928 --> 41:56.795
it just confirms, like, everything
you guys have taught me.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.379
They have to die.

42:03.855 --> 42:04.970
What?

42:07.525 --> 42:10.642
You know, I thought for a second
maybe you're getting cold feet.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.444
No. No, it was...

42:13.531 --> 42:15.362
It was part of my act.

42:20.830 --> 42:25.415
Hmm. Okay. Here.

42:29.297 --> 42:30.912
So here's how it's gonna go.

42:31.007 --> 42:35.296
The dumb one is gonna get it in the neck,
just like the big one.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.468
And then for little drummer boy,

42:37.555 --> 42:41.139
you're gonna go around from behind,
you're gonna stab him in the heart.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.829
And that way it'll look like he killed
his two friends and then he offed himself.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.218
It's classic murder-suicide.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.770
- Yeah.
- It's perfect and it's easy.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.642
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

42:54.238 --> 42:56.320
Oh, fuck. Okay. Well, fuck.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.032
- Goddamn it!
- Come on!

43:00.119 --> 43:02.735
Beverly, you bitch!
Give me that fucking knife!

43:02.830 --> 43:04.661
- Come on.
- Now!

43:13.091 --> 43:14.091
Holy shit.

43:14.175 --> 43:15.961
Come on!

43:16.052 --> 43:17.337
Shit!

43:19.680 --> 43:22.092
Shit! Damn it!

43:22.183 --> 43:24.265
Shit!

43:25.895 --> 43:27.226
Open the door!

43:27.313 --> 43:29.304
Fuck you!

43:29.398 --> 43:32.811
Move, move, move. Alex, move.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.276
Fuck!

43:36.280 --> 43:38.862
Ow! Goddamn it!

43:38.950 --> 43:40.531
Oh, my god.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.364
Open the door, boys.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.411
Fuck you!

43:46.499 --> 43:49.286
Let me break this down
for you guys.

43:49.377 --> 43:52.039
Either you come out here
and we kill you quickly,

43:52.130 --> 43:55.213
or you bleed to death slowly in there.

43:55.299 --> 43:59.008
So why don't you save yourselves the pain
and suffering and just come out here?

43:59.095 --> 44:00.926
Fucking eat me, bitch!

44:01.013 --> 44:02.844
Open the goddamn door!

44:03.850 --> 44:06.182
Jesus Christ, dude. She fucking sliced me.

44:06.269 --> 44:07.930
All right, all right.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.420
- Shit.
- Keep pressure on the door.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.393
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

44:14.902 --> 44:17.063
Holy shit. Holy shit.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.066
All right. All right.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.398
Lift your arm, lift your arm,
lift your arm.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.733
Goddamn it!

44:23.828 --> 44:26.535
Holy sh... ow, ow! Careful.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.578
- Open the goddamn door!
- Holy shit.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.167
Don't just stand there.

44:35.548 --> 44:38.381
Go find something to break
the door down with, Beverly.

44:38.467 --> 44:39.627
Where?

44:39.719 --> 44:42.802
I don't know.
Why don't you go to the barn?

44:42.889 --> 44:45.096
There's a bunch of tools
and shit in there.

44:45.183 --> 44:48.266
Go!

44:53.608 --> 44:55.018
If you don't go...

44:56.652 --> 44:59.018
This is all your fault.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.442
Their blood is on your hands, too.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.619
So just go.

45:15.630 --> 45:16.710
Jesus Christ!

45:19.550 --> 45:21.040
Goddamn it.

45:24.180 --> 45:26.717
Jj

45:57.129 --> 45:58.460
Okay.

46:17.233 --> 46:20.976
Fucking "Ruby Tuesday"
over here.

46:21.070 --> 46:23.777
Shit. Oh.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.491
- Are you okay?
- I'm gonna need a tampon, dude.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.578
- Shit.
- Boys.

46:31.831 --> 46:34.538
Do you wanna have a threesome with us?

46:35.835 --> 46:40.625
Alex is very religious,
but she will do it on this occasion only.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.125
I'm taking that as a yes.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.172
- Oh, my god.
- I'm a little bit drunk.

46:51.267 --> 46:53.383
Oh, what?

46:53.477 --> 46:56.093
Oh, I think I found something.

46:56.188 --> 46:59.601
Is it another box of twinkies?
Because this one's done.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.400
Don't say I never get you nice things.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.905
Oh, baby, is it my birthday?

47:07.992 --> 47:10.984
Come here. We'll all go down. Here.

47:11.078 --> 47:14.241
Okay. Oh, damn, girl.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.581
You just take everything
so fucking seriously.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.784
Shh.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.621
What the fuck? Holy shit.

47:23.716 --> 47:24.922
Stay there, stay there.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.670
Hey, hey.

47:26.761 --> 47:29.673
Move away from the handle,
move away from the handle.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.174
Now get away, get away, get away.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.183
Yeah, you like that, fuckers?

47:39.857 --> 47:43.099
- Oh, what did you say?
- You want some more?

47:43.194 --> 47:46.186
- Fuck. Don't breathe in.
- Cover your mouth.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.079
Are they blocking it?

48:05.174 --> 48:06.630
I think they're fucking blocking it.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.332
Go get, bev. Where the hell...

48:12.348 --> 48:14.213
- Who the fuck is that?
- Shh.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.510
- Who the fuck is...
- Shut up!

48:30.574 --> 48:31.859
Fuck.

48:48.676 --> 48:50.382
- Lexi?
- Oh, shit.

48:50.469 --> 48:52.710
It's my stepmom.

48:52.805 --> 48:54.966
Just don't say anything.

49:02.064 --> 49:04.020
Hi.

49:04.108 --> 49:08.067
Lexi. Oh, my god,
what happened to your forehead?

49:08.154 --> 49:10.315
And why on earth
are you dressed like this?

49:10.406 --> 49:13.523
Val and I went to a costume party,
and there were some drunk guys there.

49:13.617 --> 49:16.734
And someone threw something,
and it hit me in the eye.

49:16.829 --> 49:20.037
Well, what did I tell you about parties
like that? They attract a bad element.

49:20.124 --> 49:22.615
Aren't you supposed
to be in turks and Caicos?

49:22.710 --> 49:26.794
Yeah, I... that's tomorrow.
I think I left my passport here.

49:26.881 --> 49:29.839
- Uh, um, hi, Valerie.
- Hi, Mrs. Butler.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.916
No, I'm back to miss stone now.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.296
Oh, sorry, the divorce.

49:33.387 --> 49:34.627
I'm not.

49:38.392 --> 49:41.350
Dude, your stepmom has coke boogers.

49:41.437 --> 49:43.974
Jj

49:57.703 --> 49:59.284
Hallelujah.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.867
It's getting cold, man.

50:09.089 --> 50:10.499
You're going into shock.

50:12.134 --> 50:14.341
You need some sugar.

50:14.428 --> 50:17.135
Can you drink this? Here.

50:17.223 --> 50:19.805
What?

50:19.892 --> 50:21.473
What?

50:29.443 --> 50:31.900
Jj

50:49.713 --> 50:51.294
Mm.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.512
Now, we're getting out of here, man.

51:03.727 --> 51:06.013
How? Huh?

51:13.946 --> 51:17.063
We're getting the fuck out.
We're getting the fuck out of here.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.406
What are you...

51:20.911 --> 51:23.744
- Are you going MacGyver or something?
- Yeah.

51:28.002 --> 51:30.994
- Did you find it?
- Um, my passport? Yeah.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.079
- Right where I thought it'd be.
- Good. Right.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.414
Next time you see me,
I'll have a tan to die for.

51:35.509 --> 51:36.840
Right.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.337
Have a nice trip, miss stone.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.135
God bless. And you, put some ice on that.

51:40.222 --> 51:41.337
Yeah, I will.

51:41.432 --> 51:45.016
Oh, you know, if the police show up,
just tell them it was a false alarm.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.059
- What?
- Well, I saw the lights on,

51:48.147 --> 51:49.749
and there's some Van parked
behind the house,

51:49.773 --> 51:52.014
so I thought maybe somebody
was robbing the place.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.519
Is that yours?

51:53.611 --> 51:56.023
I'm borrowing it from a friend.
It's my friend's Van.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.105
You called the police?

51:59.199 --> 52:01.439
Yeah, from my car phone.
I tried your father to see if...

52:01.493 --> 52:04.109
- You called daddy?
- Yes, Alexis. We still speak.

52:04.204 --> 52:05.910
Just...

52:05.998 --> 52:09.331
Okay. Like I said, just say
it was a false alarm, okay?

52:09.418 --> 52:11.033
I got... I... I gotta go, bye.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.540
Okay.

52:18.093 --> 52:19.754
What was that?

52:19.845 --> 52:21.551
What was what?

52:22.598 --> 52:25.010
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's probably just fireworks.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.215
Who else is in this house?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.221
There's no one in the house.

52:28.312 --> 52:31.054
- What are you two girls up to?
- We're not doing anything.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.638
It's late, and I think you should go.

52:32.733 --> 52:35.645
Alexis, you better tell me
what is going on.

52:35.736 --> 52:38.398
I really, really think that you should go.

52:42.117 --> 52:46.326
You are gonna be in big trouble unless you
tell me what's going on, young lady.

52:46.413 --> 52:50.281
This is not your house anymore!
So why don't you just go?

52:50.376 --> 52:53.584
We're just having a slumber party.
Just chill the fuck out!

52:53.671 --> 52:55.912
Just...

52:57.966 --> 53:00.082
- Don't go into the...
- Oh! Oh!

53:00.177 --> 53:03.920
Don't go to the... stop! Stop!

53:04.014 --> 53:06.926
Oh, my lord. What?

53:07.017 --> 53:09.099
Oh, my god!

53:09.186 --> 53:11.347
Alexis! Oh, my god!

53:11.438 --> 53:13.599
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

53:30.624 --> 53:32.205
Holy shit!

53:38.841 --> 53:41.207
Yeah, well, I really didn't have
much of a choice, did 1?

53:42.386 --> 53:43.592
Just stick to the plan.

53:43.679 --> 53:47.297
Stick to what plan, Alex?
She called the fucking cops.

53:47.391 --> 53:50.428
Yeah, she also called my dad,
so we have to finish this right now.

53:50.519 --> 53:52.635
Are you with me?

53:52.730 --> 53:55.642
- Uh...
- Val? Val? Are you with me?

53:55.733 --> 53:57.314
Yes, I'm fucking with you, yes.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.761
So I'm gonna go to the pantry,
we're gonna get the boys out,

53:59.820 --> 54:01.881
we're gonna finish this,
and we're gonna go home, okay?

54:01.905 --> 54:03.645
Everything's gonna be fine.

54:05.909 --> 54:07.274
I'm gonna pee.

55:32.246 --> 55:33.577
I'm gonna help you up, all right?

55:33.664 --> 55:35.575
- Yeah, get me the fuck up.
- Are you ready?

55:35.666 --> 55:37.076
- Yup.
- Three, two, one.

55:39.962 --> 55:42.044
All right.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.257
Boys!

55:52.224 --> 55:56.342
"The lord will execute judgment by fire.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.927
And those slain will be many."

55:59.022 --> 56:01.229
Isaiah 66:16.

56:01.316 --> 56:05.355
Uh, chapter and fucking verse.

56:05.445 --> 56:07.276
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.400
Fire in the hole!

56:12.202 --> 56:14.443
Fuck!

56:16.915 --> 56:19.531
Do it again.
Do it again. Do it again.

56:33.098 --> 56:35.305
Fuck you!

56:35.392 --> 56:38.475
Fucking god. Damn!

56:38.562 --> 56:39.802
Psycho fucks.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.387
Do it again. Do it again.

56:42.900 --> 56:45.687
You fuckers!

56:45.777 --> 56:47.859
- Ow, fuck!
- Alexis? Alexis.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.607
- What?
- They're here.

56:49.698 --> 56:51.438
Oh, shit.

56:53.994 --> 56:57.157
- Oh!
- What are we gonna do?

56:57.247 --> 56:59.454
Just...

57:01.168 --> 57:03.375
Just stay there.

57:11.011 --> 57:13.172
Good evening, officer.

57:18.143 --> 57:19.428
Hi.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.259
Somebody call 9117

57:21.355 --> 57:24.472
oh, yeah, like, this is
such a misunderstanding.

57:24.566 --> 57:26.181
I'm, like, so totally embarrassed.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.483
Like, oh, my god.
You're not gonna believe this.

57:28.570 --> 57:31.507
So, like, my stepmom, she forgot my friend
and I were staying here this weekend,

57:31.531 --> 57:33.301
even though we told her,
like, a gazillion times,

57:33.325 --> 57:35.532
'cause she's such a space cadet,
and then, you know,

57:35.619 --> 57:37.155
she came by to get her passport,

57:37.245 --> 57:39.281
and she freaked out
when she saw lights on,

57:39.373 --> 57:41.364
and she totally
called you guys so, like,

57:41.458 --> 57:42.868
it's just one big misunderstanding.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.372
But thank you so much for coming by.

57:45.462 --> 57:47.293
Is she here?

57:47.381 --> 57:50.123
- I'm sorry?
- Is your stepmom here?

57:50.217 --> 57:53.334
Um, yeah, she is, but she's asleep,
and I don't wanna wake her up,

57:53.428 --> 57:57.137
'cause she's, like, totally moody, so...

57:57.224 --> 57:59.681
I thought you said she just stopped by
to get her passport?

57:59.768 --> 58:03.135
Yes, she did.
Then it got to be, like, super-duper late.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.832
She's, like, "I'm just gonna
spend the night,

58:04.856 --> 58:06.084
and I'm gonna leave in the morning."

58:06.108 --> 58:08.850
And the highway's probably flooded
with, like, a gazillion duls,

58:08.944 --> 58:10.400
so I'm gonna let you go.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.775
You have an ID?
Proves this is your residence, ma'am?

58:15.283 --> 58:16.819
Totally!

58:18.078 --> 58:19.864
Can I see it?

58:19.955 --> 58:23.868
Oh, well, like, I don't have it,
like, on me-on me.

58:23.959 --> 58:25.699
You know, it's, like, it's in the house.

58:26.795 --> 58:27.910
Okay. Well, I'd get it.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.925
And if you could, tell your stepmom
I'd like to have a few words with her.

58:32.217 --> 58:34.424
- No.
- Why not?

58:34.511 --> 58:36.593
I don't have to show you my ID,

58:36.680 --> 58:39.342
and I sure as hell don't have
to get my stepmom for you,

58:39.433 --> 58:41.173
- 'cause I know my rights.
- Okay, ma'am...

58:41.268 --> 58:42.829
And this has been
one big misunderstanding,

58:42.853 --> 58:44.664
and that should be
good enough for you, officer.

58:44.688 --> 58:47.270
Okay. Ma'am, I'm gonna ask you
to put both hands

58:47.357 --> 58:48.813
on top of the squad vehicle, please.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.358
Excuse me?

58:52.446 --> 58:56.359
I said I'd like for you to put both hands
on top of the squad vehicle now,

58:56.450 --> 58:57.906
and I'm not gonna ask you again.

59:01.496 --> 59:04.454
Hey! Hey, stop. Hey!

59:04.541 --> 59:05.997
Stop. Stop!

59:10.964 --> 59:12.170
- Hide.
- Okay.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.920
County sheriff.

59:18.722 --> 59:22.180
I need any and all occupants of this house
to come out with your hands up.

59:24.811 --> 59:26.347
I will shoot.

59:47.459 --> 59:49.541
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.853
I repeat, this is the sheriff.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:17.311
Anyone in this house,
come out with your hands up.

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.565
Now!

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.194
Final warning.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.150
Hey, hey, don't shoot.
Don't shoot, please.

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.932
- Hands where I can see them!
- My friend needs help!

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.558
Shut up. I said get your hands
where I can see 'em.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.976
I said hands where I can see 'em.
Both of you, now!

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.080
Hey, hey, hey!

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.729
Shut up, turn around,
put your hands against the wall.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.147
Listen, there's three girls in this house.

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.690
They're trying to fucking kill us,
all right?

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.275
Please, can you just get us out of here?

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.527
- Three girls did this to you?
- Yes!

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.403
They killed one of our friends
in the other room.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.009
They're psychopaths,
officer, sir.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.616
- Please.
- Turn around, face the wall.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.080
He needs to get to a fucking doctor!

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.120
- He's bleeding out.
- Turn around and face the wall!

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:48.759
- Shit.
- Before I shoot you both.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.891
Fuck, you're making
a big mistake, man. Please.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.188
Shut up.

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:55.231
Fuck.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.353
I said shut...

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:57.444
Oh!

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.111
Shit! Fucking fuck!

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:12.453
Val, what the fuck did you do?

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.671
- Stick to the plan, right?
- Yeah.

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.841
- You killed a cop, val.
- Yes.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.758
And now I have his gun.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.090
Shit.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:33.600
You hear that, bitches?
We got a fucking gun!

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.312
- Oh, fuck.
- Jesus, fuck!

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:41.395
Stop wasting the bullets, you moron.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:43.104
Don't call me a fucking moron.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.691
Then stop acting like one.
You're being...

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.527
- Give me the gun.
- I'm not gonna give you the gun.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.533
You're being a retard. Give me the gun.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.160
- Fuck, it's... I...
- Val!

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.832
I can handle a fucking gun, Alexis.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.162
- I'm gonna kill you if...
- You're gonna kill us fucking both!

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.916
No one is killing anyone.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.797
Fuck.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.174
Oh, wait a second, Beverly.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:09.631
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.432
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:13.225
- Beverly...
- You fucking do this.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:14.644
Val, stop it.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.471
Beverly...

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:17.851
Tell me what's wrong.

01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:19.604
What's wrong?

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.776
This whole fucking thing is what's wrong.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.149
We are doing
the lord's work here, Beverly.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.823
Oh, shut the fuck up already!

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.992
Boys, I'm coming for you!

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.239
Fuck you!

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.412
Hey, stay the fuck out of this!

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.499
Beverly...

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.744
Here, take this.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.755
It's our only chance.
We gotta go now, all right?

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:39.077
- We gotta go now.
- Now?

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.833
- Yes, let's go.
- I just...

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.084
- Come on.
- 1

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.585
- come on.
- I just... I don't...

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.292
I don't think I can go out there, man.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.844
No, no. Kovacs, we're fucking
going out there together.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:50.047
I... look at me.
I can't fucking... I...

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:52.848
If you wanna sit here and die here
by yourself, that's fine.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.894
I'd rather go out fighting,
and I'd rather you fucking be with me.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.899
Fuck it. Let's do it.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.940
You came to us.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.195
We took you in.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.868
You didn't have anything before us.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.822
You didn't have a home,
you didn't have a family.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.702
We gave you
a fucking purpose, Beverly!

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.499
No, you took advantage of me!

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:20.326
You took advantage of me, okay?

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:24.165
Just like your father is taking advantage
of all of his followers.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.466
What are you talking about?

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:30.466
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.429
I know what he's doing
with the donations, Alexis.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.728
Val, he is pocketing all of them.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:41.564
He's not building youth shelters.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.233
He's building more fucking rad pads
like this one.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.698
You poor little lamb!

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.661
You're so lost, you don't even know
what's real anymore.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.332
Get the fuck out of my way.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.165
- All right. Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.796
Ready? Okay?

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.593
- Okay.
- Ready.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.384
There's only one way out of here, Beverly,
and it's with me.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.933
So are you with me...

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.223
Or not?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.903
Get the fuck off of me!

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.086
One.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.132
Two.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.547
Three.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.844
Stop, stop, stop!

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.224
Stop. She's with us.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.001
She just tried to kill us,
like, two minutes ago.

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:06.545
I'm not really with anyone.
I was just trying to end this thing.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.981
Okay. I'm calm.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.858
I'm gonna call the cops.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.491
Let me check.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.115
It's not too deep, you're okay.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.096
What the fuck are you doing
with these two?

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.366
It's not entirely their fault.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.167
- It's not their fault?
- They were brainwashed, man.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.337
What the fuck are you talking about?
Ivan's dead.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.881
Kovacs. What the fuck?

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.299
Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:32.717
Hey.

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.840
Okay. Okay.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.842
Hey, look at me, look at me.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.173
Gget us some water.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.554
Hey. Look at me in the eyes.
You with me?

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.057
Hey, hey.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:44.604
Hey.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.807
- Here.
- Here, here.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.853
Hang in there.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.030
Keep breathing.
Just keep breathing, all right?

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.691
That's it.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.903
- Oh, fuck.
- You're safe.

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:22.809
- We gotta carry him out of here.
- I know.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.262
We gotta get him to the hospital.
Where are the car keys?

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:28.644
- Where are the car keys?
- Alexis has them.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.191
Fuck.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.399
All right. I gotta go get them then.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.481
Fuck.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.237
Wait, I... hold on, I don't think
we should separate.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.016
- Mark, I don't think we should split up.
- He's bleeding out!

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.852
The only way we're gonna get him to
a doctor in time is in a car, all right?

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:45.876
You stay with him.

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:50.541
Kovacs. Hey, kovacs.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.881
We're getting outta here.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.083
All right?

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:00.801
- All right. Fuck.
- Okay.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:03.850
Okay. Keep drinking,
you gotta stay hydrated, all right?

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:12.017
Fuck. Here.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.940
Give me your light.
Give me your light.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.146
What?

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.357
Give me your fucking light.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:21.818
Okay. Okay. I gotta stop val.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.904
No. You're not gonna leave me, are you?

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:27.035
I don't have
a fucking choice, man. All right?

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.687
- Come on, let's get you...
- Wait, wait.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.872
Come on. Ready?

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.750
One, two, three.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.967
- Okay.
- Okay. Holy shit.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.635
Deep breath. All right?

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.883
Okay.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:44.386
Here, here.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.138
- Help.
- What's going on?

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.846
Shit.

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.849
All right. All right.

01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:56.812
Relax. All right? I'm gonna be back, okay?

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.113
Okay. Okay.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.280
Jj

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.144
Oh, my god.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.813
Oh, my god. Okay.

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:45.201
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:05.968
Help, help.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:11.144
Please, officer. Please, help.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.127
- Please, you got to...
- What's going on here?

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.562
You have to help us, sir.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.189
We're..

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:22.488
Just calm down, okay?
And tell me what's going on.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.198
It's so fucked up. I...

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.653
All right. Let's start with why
are the police here.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.908
They... they killed the police.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.207
They killed the police, man, and I...

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.294
Who?

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.745
The three girls. They're... there's...

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.251
These three girls, they killed my friend.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.082
My other friend's in there.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.133
You got to help him, please.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.634
Listen to me. I've got
a cellular phone in my car.

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:50.091
I want you to call 911.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.303
Just give me the gun,
and I'll go get your friend.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.647
They're psycho... psychopaths.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:59.646
I understand. It's gonna be okay.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:01.819
Please, son, just hand me the weapon.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.419
Hey, I-1 know you.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.840
You're that pastor...

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.429
I'm the wrath of god.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.129
Good riddance.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:15.695
Damn it.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.150
No, uh-uh.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:53.483
All right. You don't have to do this, val.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:55.284
I don't have to do this?

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.659
What? You wanna be best friends
and braid each other's hair?

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.375
She's brainwashing you.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:04.827
Fuck you.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.260
You wanna be my best friend, huh?

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.426
Oh, can you breathe?

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.393
Sorry, baby.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:57.819
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:38.697
Oh, my god.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.695
Oh, my god. What happened?

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.828
Shit. Okay.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.370
Pastor is here.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:51.202
What?

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.960
S... s... save Mark.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.463
- Please. Please.
- What? What?

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.514
Save Mark.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.103
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.934
Fuck.

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:48.013
Jj

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.266
Dad!

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.024
Phew.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.646
You really screwed this one up, Alexis.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.278
- It's not my fault.
- Quiet!

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:06.531
Yes, sir.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.954
There's a sheriff's corpse in the kitchen.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:12.579
Your stepmom has bled out like
a stuck pig in the family room,

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.787
and I had to shoot
one of the bastards in the driveway.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.997
Now, how are we gonna explain this?

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.341
It was Beverly.

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:22.713
Beverly?

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:25.763
Yeah. The runaway.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.592
Where is she now?
She, uh, ran away again?

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:32.224
Val... val's taking care of her.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:35.477
You told me she was ready.
You told me she could do this.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:39.152
I thought that she was.
I'm sorry, but I can fix this.

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:41.149
- I can fix it.
- It's too late for that now.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.980
They already suspect us,
and now this?

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:49.323
We're gonna have to make
some sacrifices.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:52.282
What kind of sacrifices?

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:56.912
What did daddy call you
when you were a little girl,

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.712
and you fell off your bike?

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.167
Reckless Alexis?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:06.837
And that's what you've been here tonight.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:10.220
Right? Reckless and careless.

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:15.016
And you've put everything
I've worked so hard for in jeopardy.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:22.107
- I don't know what to do.
- Shh. Hey, hey.

01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:23.859
But it's okay.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:28.613
We're gonna do something
drastic, unexpected.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.036
I don't unders...

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.284
Why do you think
I chose you for this mission?

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.990
Why do you think I chose this house?

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:40.292
It's the only way to erase
any doubt from their minds.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.122
They'll have no choice but to believe.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.463
But it's okay, baby.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.545
You're gonna die a martyr, like...

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.848
Bev! Oh, my god.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:02.605
You saved me.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:05.312
Thank you. Thank you.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.192
It was my dad.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.618
You heard him?

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:14.788
He set me up. He set us up.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.615
Shut the fuck up, Alexis.

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:19.080
Just listen to me.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:23.957
We can get out of here.
You and me, just help me.

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.042
We can get out of here.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:31.263
We're innocent. We're victims.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.556
I'm a victim!

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.179
This is on you.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.510
It was my dad.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.185
- He did this.
- This is on you!

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:43.730
You... you've always been useless!

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.903
You've always been a fucking waste!

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:48.276
You've always...

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:03.204
Oh, my god.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:06.541
Oh, my god. Okay. Oh, god. Okay.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.342
Okay.

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.011
Okay.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.008
Come here.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.773
Jj

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.579
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.049
Hey, come on.

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.333
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna make it.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.133
What? What are you doing?

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:36.385
Yes, you are. Come here.
I ook. Come on. Come on.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:04.079
Jj

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.004
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.897
Jj

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:42.704
Another gruesome
ritualistic murder-suicide

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.622
claimed the lives of six people
last night,

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.120
following a heavy metal concert

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.873
that local religious groups
were protesting.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:52.456
The murders took place at the country
estate of pastor John Henry Butler,

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.463
and are believed to be orchestrated
by his own daughter, Alexis.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.545
Pastor Butler happened
upon the perpetrators

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.129
and bravely fought them off,

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.135
suffering only minor cuts and bruises.

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:04.184
Pastor Butler, the founder
of the daughters of the dawn,

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:06.478
a hationwide congregation
for wayward girls,

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.851
spoke to reporters outside
his home moments ago.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:13.064
My daughter was confused.

01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:16.859
Like so many young people today.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:18.235
Amen.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.113
And in her confusion,

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:23.913
she turned to a deadly
and devious group of individuals

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.035
hell-bent on spreading Satan's message.

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:33.005
Ask yourselves, how many more children
must die in Satan's name?

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.627
I just hope we all can work together,

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:40.133
figure out a way to end this evil...

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:42.215
30.67.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.641
No more questions, please.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:49.433
Authorities
are still on the lookout

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:52.107
for the culprits responsible
for this slew of murders,

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:56.608
a satanic cult that call themselves
we summon the darkness.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.118
You know, you shouldn't believe
everything you see.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.057
Sorry.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.016
Morning.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.269
Where are we?

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:40.110
Hell if I know.

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:17.191
J something in the moonlight
catches my eye j

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:19.986
j the shadow of a lover goes dancing by

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:23.031
j looking for a little bit
of love to grow, so j

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:25.279
j give me love, give me heart and soul j

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.986
j you never let me cross
to the other side now j&

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.572
j I'm tied to the hope
that you will somehow j

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.953
j hard on the heels of something more j&

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.878
j but I lost your love, heart and soul j
