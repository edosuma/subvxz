male narrator: 16 OF THE BEST
TATTOO ARTISTS IN THE COUNTRY

00:04.212 --> 00:08.258
ARE BATTLING IT OUT, TO
DETERMINE WHO'S NUMBER ONE.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.303
narrator: ON THE LAST EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:15.807
EIGHT ARTISTS WERE LEFT
IN THE COMPETITION.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.600
- YOUR DESIGN SHOULD BE ONE

00:17.684 --> 00:21.479
YOU ARE WILLING TO
WEAR...PERMANENTLY.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.606

CHALLENGE, THE COMPETITION

00:23.690 --> 00:24.941

00:25.024 --> 00:27.360
narrator: WHEN THE ARTISTS
TATTOOED EACH OTHER.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.237
- THIS DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE,
HOW YOU HAVE IT.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.947
- FEEL LIKE
I'M MARRIED TWICE, DUDE.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.448
WHAT THE...

00:32.531 --> 00:33.616
narrator: AT THE ELIMINATION
TATTOO...

00:33.700 --> 00:35.618
- WELCOME BACK.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.953
narrator: THE ARTISTS TATTOOED
SOME FAMILIAR FACES.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.247
- DO YOU WANT TO
DRAW YOUR OWN TATTOO?

00:39.330 --> 00:40.290
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].
- I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA DO THAT.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.709
- [laughs]

00:42.792 --> 00:44.586
narrator: AND TATU BABY
CRACKED UNDER THE PRESSURE.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.045
- I'M EMBARRASSING MYSELF.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.464
- I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR WORK.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.840
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

00:48.923 --> 00:49.466
- BUT YOU HAVE TO BRING
YOUR "A" GAME EVERY DAY.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.469
- NOBODY'S SAFE.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.597
narrator: AT THE ELIMINATION,
TATU BABY, JOSHUA,

00:55.680 --> 00:58.016
AND CRAIG
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

00:58.099 --> 01:02.395
- THIS IS THE TOUGHEST DECISION,
'CAUSE YOU SHOULD ALL GO.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.397
- I FEEL LIKE
I'M DISAPPOINTING MY FAMILY.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.399
- IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO COMPETE,

01:06.483 --> 01:07.817
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
AROUND THAT.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.110
- I'M NOT PERFORMING TO
THE LEVEL THAT I SHOULD.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.154
MY HEART AND HEAD
ARE NOT IN THIS GAME,

01:11.237 --> 01:12.989
AND I HAVE TO GO HOME.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.991
- YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT?

01:15.074 --> 01:17.368
- GONNA LEAVE IT
UP TO YOU GUYS.

01:17.452 --> 01:23.458
- CRAIG, YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO BE A INK MASTER.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.752
narrator: SEVEN ARTISTS REMAIN,
BUT ONLY ONE

01:25.835 --> 01:29.422

EVERYONE HERE KNOWS

PROPORTION DAY, IT HAD
A MID-CALF BOOT ON ONE LEG,

03:14.652 --> 03:16.237
AND A HIGH BOOT
ON THE OTHER LEG.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.573
ITS FACE WAS ALL [bleep] UP,
ITS FINGERS WERE [bleep] UP

03:18.656 --> 03:21.284

03:21.367 --> 03:24.370
{\an1}CRAIG CAN'T DO BLACK AND GRAY,
BUT HE'S GOT PERFECT PROPORTION.

I'M ON CRAZY PILLS.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.672
DUDE, I GOT PROBLEMS AT HOME.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.299
THE ONLY THING THAT EVEN KEEPS
ME HERE RIGHT NOW,

03:36.382 --> 03:37.842
AND NOT THROWING
IN THE TOWEL,

03:37.926 --> 03:40.678
IS THE BITTER TASTE OF POSSIBLY
GOING HOME BEFORE YOU,

03:40.762 --> 03:42.847
AND LEAVING YOU
TO BECOME INK MASTER.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.141

{\an8}FLASHBACKS

04:21.469 --> 04:24.138
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
AT THIS POINT.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.682
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.977
SEVEN OF YOU REMAIN, BUT ONLY
ONE WILL WALK AWAY

04:29.060 --> 04:32.522
WITH $100,000, A FEATURE
IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

04:32.605 --> 04:35.024
AND THE TITLE OF
INK MASTER.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.237
THIS WEEK, WE'RE TESTING
CONSISTENCY.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.531
{\an8}- CONSISTENCY ACTUALLY PERTAINS
TO ALMOST EVERY PART

04:41.614 --> 04:43.825
{\an8}OF EXECUTING A GREAT,
SOLID TATTOO.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.035
YOU NEED TO BE CONSISTENT
IN YOUR LINING, SHADING,

04:46.119 --> 04:47.870
COLOR, SATURATION.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.499
- FOR TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE,
YOU MUST SHOW CONSISTENCY

04:51.582 --> 04:53.334
BY CARVING A DESIGN

04:53.418 --> 04:55.253
INTO A HUMAN SKULL.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.885
LIKE TATTOOING, THE DECORATION
OF HUMAN REMAINS

05:02.969 --> 05:05.346
HAS EXISTED FOR CENTURIES.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.057
ORNATE DESIGNS
WERE CARVED TO REMOVE CURSES,

05:08.141 --> 05:12.270
OR GUIDE LOST SOULS
TO THE AFTERLIFE.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.062
{\an8}- THIS ISN'T GONNA BE FUN.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.899
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY DIFFICULT.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
- YOU HAVE THREE HOURS
TO ETCH YOUR DESIGN

05:19.068 --> 05:22.572
INTO YOUR HUMAN SKULL.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.740
TREAD CAREFULLY.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.659
ONE MISSTEP CAN SHATTER
YOUR SKULL.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.413
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.376
{\an8}- THE BEST WAY FOR THESE
ARTISTS TO SHOW CONSISTENCY

05:35.460 --> 05:37.378
{\an8}IS TO MAKE A DESIGN THAT
MIRRORS ITSELF ON EACH SIDE,

05:37.462 --> 05:40.131
{\an8}TO SHOW US THAT THEY CAN
CONSISTENTLY HOLD

05:40.214 --> 05:42.258
{\an8}THE SAME PATTERN.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.427
{\an8}- I JUST NEED TO DESIGN
SOMETHING THAT THE JUDGES

05:44.510 --> 05:46.637
{\an8}WILL FIND ATTRACTIVE,
AND MAKE

05:46.721 --> 05:48.264
{\an8}EACH SIDE
PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.224
{\an8}AT THIS POINT, IT'S SUPER
IMPORTANT FOR ME

05:50.308 --> 05:51.726
{\an8}TO WIN A FLASH CHALLENGE.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.144
{\an8}ANY LITTLE ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW

05:53.227 --> 05:57.023
{\an8}CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
IN MY STAYING HERE.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.442
{\an8}- IT DOES GET A LITTLE
IN YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE BIT.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.527
{\an8}I'M HERE TO WIN.
I WANT THE TITLE.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.029
{\an8}I WANT, OBVIOUSLY,
THE $100,000.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.156
BUT MY MOM'S THE BIGGEST
REASON WHY I'M HERE.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.283
WHEN I HEAR HER VOICE,
AND SHE'S SICK,

06:07.366 --> 06:08.951
IT DEFINITELY TAKES
A HUGE TOLL ON ME.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.121
I NEED TO WIN THIS FOR HER.
I-I WANT TO MAKE HER PROUD.

06:12.205 --> 06:16.959
I DEFINITELY WANT TO
MAKE HER PROUD.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.378
THAT IS HOT.
- THANKS.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.963
{\an8}JACKIE'S GOING TO
STAY A DEAD SKULL.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.466
{\an8}WAY TOO CLICHE.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.634
{\an8}I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
MORE CHALLENGING.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.930
WHEN I THINK OF THE HARDEST
WAY TO SHOW CONSISTENCY,

06:29.013 --> 06:30.181
IT'S THROUGH LETTERING.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.141
I NEED TO WIN.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.185
BECAUSE I'M STILL SHAKING
FROM ELIMINATION.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.771
I'VE BEEN HAVING A REALLY HARD
TIME PERSONALLY.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.147
IT'S BEEN REFLECTING
ON MY WORK.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.650
- CAN YOU COME OUT
OF YOUR TAILSPIN?

06:40.733 --> 06:41.984
- I'M DEALING WITH ALL THIS
STRESS OF THIS HOUSE.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.320
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.988
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
REACH THAT ROCK BOTTOM

06:46.072 --> 06:48.491
SO YOU CAN COME BACK UP.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.535
I JUST GOT TO SUCK IT UP,
AND FIGHT FOR IT.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.411
- ONE HOUR LEFT, EVERYBODY.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.543
- I'M SO EXHAUSTED.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.710
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
SLEEP SINCE ELIMINATION.

06:59.794 --> 07:03.214
{\an8}THIS LAST ELIMINATION
[bleep] WITH MY HEAD SO MUCH.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.132
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
VOTED THAT YOU

07:04.215 --> 07:09.178
HAD THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.347
- I FEEL LIKE
I'M DISAPPOINTING MY FAMILY.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.599
I HAVE TO GET RID OF ALL
THOSE THOUGHTS, CLEAR MY HEAD,

07:13.683 --> 07:14.934
AND GET ONTO THIS COMPETITION.

07:15.017 --> 07:15.643
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME

07:15.726 --> 07:17.770
TO WIN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

07:17.854 --> 07:19.188
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY FEEL
I HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.816
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.693
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T WON
A FLASH CHALLENGE,

07:23.776 --> 07:26.696
{\an8}AND I NEED TO BE ABLE TO
GIVE MYSELF THE ADVANTAGE.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.614
I'M NOT GOING
FOR THE EASY ROAD.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
I WANT TO GIVE MY DESIGN
A LITTLE BIT MORE EXTRA

07:30.616 --> 07:33.202
THAT I KNOW THAT NO ONE ELSE
IS ADDING.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.538
- JIME FOUND A WAY
AROUND THE RULES.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.540
{\an8}HE NEEDS TO
HAVE THINGS HIS WAY,

07:37.623 --> 07:38.875
{\an8}OR HE'S GONNA
COMPLAIN ABOUT 'EM

07:38.958 --> 07:39.917
{\an8}TILL HE GETS HIS WAY.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.545
- TEN MORE MINUTES.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.379
- THE STAKES ARE
HIGHER FOR ME.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.506
I WAS UPSIDE-DOWN
ON MY MORTGAGE.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.800
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT I
LOST EVERYTHING I OWN.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.677
I DON'T HAVE ANYPLACE
TO SLEEP.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.972
I HAVE TO AT LEAST STAY HERE
JUST TO HAVE A BED.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.266
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

07:55.349 --> 07:58.644
SEVEN, SIX, FIVE,

07:58.728 --> 08:02.064
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.401
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP.

08:05.484 --> 08:06.402
NO MORE ETCHING.

08:06.485 --> 08:07.153
- YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW PAINT JOB?

08:07.236 --> 08:09.488
"MM-HMM! YEAH, I DO.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.241
THANKS, BUDDY."

08:12.325 --> 08:14.577
- JASON, HOW DID YOU
GO ABOUT DESIGNING IT?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.537
- WHAT I DID IS
I DREW A CENTER LINE,

08:16.621 --> 08:18.122
AND THEN I DREW
A CENTER LINE SIDEWAYS,

08:18.206 --> 08:19.916
AND THEN I WENT FROM THERE,
AND I JUST ACTUALLY DREW

08:19.999 --> 08:21.918
ONE WHOLE SIDE ON,
AND THEN I DID THE ENGRAVING.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.753
- I LOVE THE WAY IT STARTS TO
FIT THE SKULL, AND COME AROUND,

08:23.836 --> 08:27.089
BUT WHEN IT GETS TO THE BACK,
AND GOES OVER THE CROWN,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.758
I THINK YOU LOST
YOUR SYMMETRY.

08:28.841 --> 08:33.179
THEREFORE, YOU LOST A LITTLE BIT
OF YOUR CONSISTENCY AS WELL.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.429
- JOSHUA.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.097
- I MADE SURE THAT I DID
CONSISTENT LINES

08:36.182 --> 08:37.433
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING.

08:37.515 --> 08:38.100
I TRIED TO USE
THE ENTIRE SKULL.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.394
- GOOD, EVEN DESIGN.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.854
LOOKS THE SAME
ON BOTH SIDES.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.147
THINK YOU DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB

08:43.231 --> 08:44.774
KEEPING ALL YOUR LINE WEIGHTS
THE SAME.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.777
- IT'S REALLY GRAPHIC, REALLY
CONSISTENT, RECOGNIZABLE.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.071
IT'S STRONG IMAGERY.
LOOKS GREAT.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.281
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- BABY.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.574
- I DO LIKE THE LETTERING,

08:53.658 --> 08:54.909
AND THE THICK AND THIN
KIND OF STYLE

08:54.992 --> 08:56.118
OF LETTERING THAT YOU DID.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.536
IT'S NOT CONSISTENCY,

08:57.620 --> 08:59.038
BUT IT'S A NICE LOOKING STYLE
THROUGHOUT.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.624
- THINK YOU HAVE SOME
NICE SHAPED LETTERS.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.292
AS FAR AS CONSISTENCY GOES,

09:03.376 --> 09:05.086
I THINK THERE'S A LOT
OF SKETCHY LINES.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.587
NO TWO LINES
REALLY LOOK THE SAME.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.173
{\an8}- SHE'S DEFINITELY SHOWING
CONSISTENTLY

09:09.257 --> 09:11.801
{\an8}THAT SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH THIS COMPETITION.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.302
- JACKIE, WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN
WITH THIS SKULL?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.178
- BASICALLY, JUST TO
SHOW A CONSISTENCY

09:14.262 --> 09:17.139
WITH THE DEPTH OF THE LINES.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.933
- SOME OF THE SWOOPING CURLS,
I WISH THEY WERE

09:19.016 --> 09:19.809
A LITTLE MORE SMOOTH.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.811
GET THAT GOOD,
CONSISTENT LINE WORK,

09:21.894 --> 09:23.187
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S WOBBLING.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.897
DESIGN ON THE BACK GOT
A LITTLE BIT TOO LOOSE.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.192
IT'S GOT A LITTLE SLOPPIER FEEL
THAN THE FLOWERS ON THE FRONT.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.318
- KYLE.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.570
- I LIKE THE WAY YOU CARVED IN
AND PUT SOME DEEP CUTS

09:31.654 --> 09:33.531
INTO THE SKULL,
BUT THAT GAVE YOU

09:33.614 --> 09:34.490
A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE

09:34.573 --> 09:36.284
WITH TRYING TO KEEP UP
THE CONSISTENCY.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.662
- DOING THOSE DEEP CUTS, LIKE,
THE CONSISTENCY'S NOT SOLID.

09:39.745 --> 09:43.124
BUT IT KIND OF GIVES IT A REALLY
COOL, THREE-DIMENSIONAL LOOK.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.001
AND THE HIGHLIGHTS
FROM THE ACTUAL LIGHT

09:45.084 --> 09:46.669
LOOK REALLY GOOD
IN THE CARVED EDGES.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.753
- THANK YOU.
- JOEY.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.840
- MY OVERALL IDEA WAS
POSITIVE-NEGATIVE FLAMES.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.508
- I THINK, OVERALL,
FROM A DISTANCE,

09:52.591 --> 09:55.052
IT DOESN'T LOOK
AS CONSISTENT.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.514
THERE'S LESS SYMMETRY HERE THAN
WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER SKULLS.

09:58.597 --> 10:02.101
- TOP UP HERE,
IS VERY UNSYMMETRICAL.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.060
IT'S VERY UNEVEN.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.979
THERE'S A LOT OF, JUST,
RANDOMNESS TO IT.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.690
FOR ME, THAT RANDOMNESS TAKES IT
AWAY FROM BEING CONSISTENT.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.192
{\an8}- FLAMES, A REOCCURRING THEME
WITH JOEY.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.902
{\an8}SKULLS, FLAMES.

10:11.986 --> 10:12.611
{\an8}FLAMES, SKULLS.

10:12.695 --> 10:16.699
AND IT'S NOT VERY ORIGINAL.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.369
- JIME, HOW DID YOU ACHIEVE
THIS BLACK EFFECT?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.371
- MARKER. EVERYTHING
THAT WAS AT OUR DESK

10:22.455 --> 10:23.789
WE COULD USE AT OUR DISPOSAL.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.875
- THAT'S A NICE ELEMENT
THAT YOU ADDED HERE.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.918
THAT ADDS A LOT OF REAL
DIMENSION AND CHARACTER

10:28.002 --> 10:29.086
TO YOUR DESIGN.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.047
IT'S A PRETTY CREATIVE USE
OF YOUR TOOLS.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.548
- GREAT, CONSISTENT LINES,
MAN.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.259
IT'S A STRONG LOOK, AND WE CAN
NOTICE IT ACROSS THE ROOM.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.719
YOURS AND JOSHUA'S
DEFINITELY STAND OUT,

10:36.802 --> 10:37.762
BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSISTENT,

10:37.845 --> 10:39.096
AND BECAUSE OF
THE POSITIVE-NEGATIVE.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.767
WHEN YOU'RE A CRAFTSMAN,
YOU'RE A CRAFTSMAN.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.561
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WE DID ETCHINGS IN SKULLS.

10:45.644 --> 10:46.771
WE ARE FOCUSING
ON CONSISTENCY.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.065
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I BELIEVE
THAT JOEY'S IN THE BOTTOM.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.359
- ABSOLUTELY.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.526
MY LEAST FAVORITE OF THE DAY.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.487
THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY IN IT

10:54.570 --> 10:57.239
FROM CRAFTSMANSHIP,
TO ARTISTRY, TO PLACEMENT.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.574
- JOEY'S HAS NO FLOW.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.742
IT HAS NOTHING DYNAMIC
ABOUT IT.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.578
AT LEAST KYLE, TO ME,
HAS A NICE DESIGN.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.288
IT'S ACTUALLY BEVELED IN,
AND FOLLOWS THE CURVE.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.083
- BUT CONSISTENCY,
NOT SO MUCH.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.378
- JIME AND JOSH'S ARE THE ONLY
TWO THAT JUST LOOK PERFECT.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.005
JOSH'S DESIGN,
HOW WELL IT FITS,

11:13.089 --> 11:16.634
AND HOW CONSISTENT HIS LINE
WEIGHT IS STANDS OUT STRONGER.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.220
- I LIKE JIME'S MORE,
BECAUSE HE PUT THE BLACK IN,

11:19.303 --> 11:21.972
AND THAT LINE WORK
IS PERFECT CRAFTSMANSHIP.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.099
- SHOULD WE GO DECLARE
A WINNER?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.101
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

11:25.184 --> 11:29.230
- ALL RIGHT.
THINK WE GOT IT.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.607
ARTISTS, TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO ETCH A PATTERN

11:31.690 --> 11:34.985
INTO A HUMAN SKULL,
SHOWING CONSISTENCY.

11:35.069 --> 11:35.361
TWO OF YOU IMPRESSED US.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.445
JOSHUA.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.781
- I REALLY LIKE
YOUR SKULL, MAN.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.533
IT HAS A VERY EVEN,
CONSISTENT TEXTURE THROUGHOUT,

11:40.616 --> 11:43.327
AND THAT IS
THE NAME OF THE GAME TODAY.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.453
- THANK YOU.
- JIME.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.123
- THE LINES AND CONSISTENCY

11:47.206 --> 11:49.291
THAT YOU PULLED OFF
IN YOUR SKULL ARE TOP NOTCH.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.794
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

11:51.877 --> 11:58.467
THAT THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

11:58.551 --> 12:01.846
JOSHUA.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.432
{\an8}- I'M PUTTING MY ALL INTO IT,
AND IT'S COMING UP SHORT.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.183
{\an8}THIS GUY'S
HALF-ASSING SOMETHING

12:06.267 --> 12:07.810
{\an8}AND COMING OUT
THE GOLDEN CHILD.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.145
{\an8}I'M PISSED.

12:09.228 --> 12:09.979
- THANK YOU.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.106
- YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN

12:12.189 --> 12:14.483
ALL HUMAN CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.026
- I AM SO EXCITED
THAT I WON.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.863
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH SOME [bleep] ASS[bleep]

12:18.946 --> 12:20.781
GIVING ME A [bleep] CANVAS.

12:20.865 --> 12:21.574
I GET TO PICK
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.576
I GET TO SHINE
IN THIS MOMENT,

12:23.659 --> 12:25.202
AND I'M SUPER FRICKIN' STOKED.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.163
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND GET READY

12:27.246 --> 12:29.999
TO MEET YOUR HUMAN CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:30.082 --> 12:30.958
- THANKS.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.759
{\an8}- PART OF MY STRATEGY
IS NOT LETTING PEOPLE KNOW

12:40.843 --> 12:42.094
{\an8}WHAT MY STRATEGY IS.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.053
{\an8}- [bleep] THAT KID.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.889
{\an8}JOSH IS THE LOWEST-HANGING
FRUIT WE GOT.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.223
{\an8}- I JUST WANTED TO
SHAKE THE TREE.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.224
{\an8}- THAT'S BULL[bleep], JOSH.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.856
- YOU BETTER PLAY
THE SKULLS RIGHT.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.150
POINT BLANK, IF IT'S SCREWING
PEOPLE OVER, OH, WELL.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.860
- MAKE IT HARD, MAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.487
IF SOMEBODY LIKE CRAIG
CAN GO HOME EARLY,

12:59.570 --> 13:01.697
WHY NOT KNOCK OFF
ANOTHER ONE?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.574
- I NEED EVERY ADVANTAGE
I CAN AT THIS POINT.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.619
HEY, I WILL EVEN TAKE JOSHUA'S
HELP, BECAUSE I NEED TO GET

13:06.702 --> 13:08.037
AHEAD IN THE GAME.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.330
- I'M GOIN' FOR JIME AND JOEY.
- THE TOP DOGS.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.875
IF I WAS HANDIN' OUT SKULLS,
I WOULD DO THE SAME EXACT THING.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.126
THEY ALREADY HATE YOU.
OH, WELL.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.503
- THEY HAVE, LIKE,
THE BIGGEST EGOS.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.379
WHY DO THEY THINK, THEY'RE
JUST EXPECTED TO WIN?

13:17.463 --> 13:18.589
JIME, "THE PRINCESS,"
AS SOON AS HE DIDN'T WIN,

13:18.672 --> 13:20.883
HE WAS, LIKE,
ALL BUTT-HURT, LIKE,

13:20.966 --> 13:21.967
"OH, THAT'S SO [bleep] UP,
AND UNFAIR."

13:22.051 --> 13:24.595
- JIME WILL BITCH
NO MATTER WHAT YOU GIVE HIM.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.138
THAT'S WHAT PRINCESSES DO.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.974
BUT I SAY, HEY, MAN,
LET'S CHALLENGE 'EM.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.226
- JACKIE AND JASON ARE
ENCOURAGING ME TO GO AFTER

13:30.309 --> 13:32.728
THE STRONGER PEOPLE, AND I'M
SAYING THAT I'M GONNA DO THAT,

13:32.811 --> 13:34.563
JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
TELL THEM MY GAME PLAN.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.190
{\an8}PART OF MY STRATEGY
IS NOT LETTING PEOPLE KNOW

13:36.273 --> 13:36.732
{\an8}WHAT MY STRATEGY IS.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.567
- UNDERDOGS UNITE.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.570
- UNDERDOGS UNITE.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.252
- WELCOME TO
THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.753
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE

13:57.836 --> 13:59.922
YOU DESERVE TO STAY
HERE ANOTHER WEEK,

14:00.005 --> 14:02.258
AND FIGHT FOR THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.385
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK,

14:04.468 --> 14:05.636
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

14:05.719 --> 14:09.098
WE ALSO HAVE
A SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

14:09.181 --> 14:09.807
A SELF-TAUGHT ILLUSTRATOR

14:09.890 --> 14:10.724
AND RECENTLY APPOINTED ARTIST

14:10.808 --> 14:13.894
ON D.C. COMICS BEST-SELLER,
<i>BATMAN.</i>

14:13.978 --> 14:16.063
HE IS BEST KNOWN
FOR HIS 80-ISSUE RUN

14:16.146 --> 14:17.189
ON THE COMIC <i> SPAWN.</i>

14:17.273 --> 14:19.900
GREG CAPULLO.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.945
{\an8}- COMIC BOOKS ARE BIG,
AND BALLSY, AND COLORFUL.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.155
TATTOOS NEED TO FOLLOW
THE SAME RULES,

14:25.239 --> 14:28.158
WHICH MEANS, A IMAGE THAT CAN
BE EASILY INTERPRETED

14:28.242 --> 14:29.743
FROM A DISTANCE AWAY.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.953
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
AN ICONIC FIGURE THAT POPS.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.581
- I'M SUPER EXCITED
THAT GREG CAPULLO IS HERE.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.041
HE'S AN AMAZING
COMIC BOOK ARTIST.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.543
{\an8}I HAVE BOXES
OF COMIC BOOKS AT HOME,

14:37.626 --> 14:39.753
{\an8}AND I'M DEFINITELY FAMILIAR
WITH HIS ARTWORK.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.381
- AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT
YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.967
EACH WEEK, SPIKE AND TACO BELL
ARE GIVING VIEWERS

14:45.050 --> 14:47.886
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO
TO INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM,

14:47.970 --> 14:50.472
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.891
AMERICA'S VOTE WILL HAVE
A MASSIVE IMPACT

14:52.975 --> 14:55.728
ON THE LIVE FINALE.

14:55.811 --> 14:56.895
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING CONSISTENCY.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.981
{\an8}- CONSISTENCY IS BEING ABLE
TO SHOW

14:59.064 --> 15:02.484
{\an8}PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.987
- YOU MUST BE ABLE TO
TATTOO UNIFORM LINES,

15:05.070 --> 15:08.282
SHADING, AND COLOR, GIVING
YOUR DESIGN A HARMONIOUS LOOK.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.908
THERE'S NO BETTER TEST OF
CONSISTENCY THAN AN IMAGE

15:09.992 --> 15:14.413
SO ICONIC THAT ANY
INCONSISTENCY WILL BE OBVIOUS.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.332
COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.209
{\an8}- YES! THE CHALLENGES OF
PULLING OFF COMIC BOOK TATTOO

15:19.293 --> 15:21.211
{\an8}ARE MAKING IT AS DIRECT TO
THE COMIC CHARACTER AT HAND.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.673
{\an8}PEOPLE THAT ARE COMIC NERDS,
WHICH, I SAY THAT PROUDLY,

15:24.757 --> 15:26.300
{\an8}THEY KNOW
WHEN SOMETHING'S OFF.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.345
- FOUNDED IN 1934,
D.C. COMICS IS HOME

15:29.428 --> 15:31.180
TO THE WORLD'S GREATEST
SUPERHEROES,

15:31.263 --> 15:33.599
LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN,
SUPERMAN, AND WONDER WOMAN,

15:33.682 --> 15:36.018
AND OF COURSE, BATMAN.

15:36.101 --> 15:40.230
BUT THIS WEEK, YOU WON'T BE
TATTOOING A SUPERHERO.

15:40.314 --> 15:44.652
YOU MUST TATTOO...
A SUPERVILLAIN.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.071
{\an8}- WITHOUT VILLAINS,
YOU HAVE NO NEED FOR HEROES.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.032
{\an8}GENERALLY, VILLAINS
ARE MORE DYNAMIC

15:50.115 --> 15:50.824
{\an8}THAN THE HERO THEMSELVES.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.452
- LET'S MEET
YOUR CANVASSES.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.628
- JOSHUA, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

16:02.711 --> 16:06.382
AND YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO
ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASSES.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.051
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
WREAK SOME HAVOC.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.053
GO AHEAD
AND ASSIGN THE SKULLS.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.388
{\an8}- I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE
THAT NOBODY EXCEPT FOR ME

16:12.471 --> 16:14.723
{\an8}GETS AN EASY DAY.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.392
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THEIR WEAKNESSES ARE.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.227
I DEFINITELY AM PLAYING
THE MENTAL GAME HARD RIGHT.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.770
IS ANYBODY HERE
INTERESTED IN GETTING

16:19.853 --> 16:22.189
A PORTRAIT STYLE SUPERVILLAIN?

16:22.272 --> 16:23.524
- I WOULD DO PORTRAIT.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.367
{\an8}- HE MIGHT ACTUALLY
GIVE THAT TO JIME,

16:33.450 --> 16:36.370
{\an8}TO TEST JIME'S
PORTRAIT SKILLS.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.371
{\an8}THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.288
- ANYA, CATWOMAN.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.582
- I'M CLAUDIA,
AND THIS IS POISON IVY.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.544
- I DEFINITELY WANT
THE POISON IVY.

16:43.627 --> 16:44.920
{\an8}HERE'S THE MAGICAL QUESTION
AT HAND--

16:45.003 --> 16:47.131
{\an8}IS JOSHUA GONNA LOOK OUT
FOR US UNDERDOGS,

16:47.214 --> 16:48.048
{\an8}OR IS HE GONNA PULL SOME
OTHER BULL[bleep]?

16:48.132 --> 16:50.175
- I'M AMELIA,
AND THIS IS DARKSEID.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.553
- AND HOW BIG DO YOU WANT IT?
- PREFER THE WHOLE CALF.

16:54.012 --> 16:55.931
- IF JOSHUA SCREWS ME,
THEN [bleep] THAT KID.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.767
I'M WEARING HIS TATTOO.
HE'S WEARING MINE.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.103
{\an8}WE'VE BEEN IFFY BEFORE.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.772
{\an8}IT'S VERY POSSIBLE
HE'LL SCREW ME.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.773
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

17:05.858 --> 17:06.942
PLEASE READ
THE ARTIST'S NAME

17:07.025 --> 17:08.234
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.987
- JOSHUA.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.780
- PEOPLE COME TO ME
FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD

17:11.864 --> 17:13.365
TO GET PORTRAITS DONE.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.950
IT'S DEFINITELY MY SPECIALTY,

17:15.032 --> 17:16.702
AND I'M SUPER EXCITED TO BE
ABLE TO SHOW WHAT I CAN DO.

17:16.785 --> 17:20.122
{\an8}- JOEY.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.332
{\an8}- JIME.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.085
{\an8}- TURNS OUT,
HE PULLED SOME BULL[bleep].

17:25.169 --> 17:26.170
{\an8}COME ON, JOEY'S GONNA
KILL ANYTHING

17:26.252 --> 17:29.006
{\an8}THAT HAS TO DO WITH A COOL
PIN-UP, AND SO IS JIME.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.675
{\an8}WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING, JOSHUA?

17:31.759 --> 17:36.430
{\an8}- TATU BABY.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.306
{\an8}- KYLE.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.850
{\an8}- JOSH GAVE ME
THE ABSOLUTE HARDEST ONE

17:39.933 --> 17:40.976
{\an8}HE POSSIBLY COULD.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.102
{\an8}[bleep] THAT KID.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.606
{\an8}- JACKIE.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.315
{\an8}- JASON.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.983
{\an8}- IT'S OBVIOUS AT THIS POINT

17:48.067 --> 17:51.653
{\an8}THAT JOSHUA'S GUNNING
FOR MYSELF AND JACKIE.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.197
{\an8}JOSHUA'S FULL OF [bleep].

17:53.280 --> 17:54.782
{\an8}YOU'RE PLAYING A STUPID GAME.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.826
{\an8}YOU'RE GETTIN' READY TO
LOSE YOURSELF, IDIOT.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.162
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:00.245 --> 18:01.830
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

18:01.914 --> 18:04.833
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST,

18:04.917 --> 18:07.586
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.963
YOU MAY NOW CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.673
THEN, YOU WILL HAVE
SIX HOURS TO COMPLETE

18:11.757 --> 18:14.092
YOUR SUPERVILLAIN TATTOO.

18:14.176 --> 18:18.514
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.973
GOOD LUCK.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.893
{\an8}- CONSISTENCY COMES INTO PLAY
IN ALL TATTOOS.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.312
{\an8}IT'S YOUR LINE WEIGHT, IT'S
YOUR SHADING, IT'S YOUR VALUES.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.272
{\an8}IT'S EVERYTHING THAT GOES
INTO CREATING A SUPERVILLAIN.

18:29.316 --> 18:34.112
- I THINK I DO LIKE IT
MORE REAL, LESS CARTOON.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.031
- THAT WHIPS GONNA BE A LOT.
DO YOU LIKE THAT?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.200
- I WANTED TO TRY TO
WORK IN THE CATS.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.537
- DUDE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANGLE
YOU WENT ON THIS ONE, MAN,

18:41.620 --> 18:42.704
BUT I'M [bleep] PUMPED
ON THIS.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.581
- I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:44.665 --> 18:45.374
{\an8}"[bleep], IF I'M GONNA WIN,
IT'S GONNA BE

18:45.457 --> 18:46.834
BECAUSE I DID SOME
SICK [bleep]."

18:46.917 --> 18:48.252
{\an8}NEW SCHOOL
THIS THING UP, BUDDY.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.378
{\an8}I'LL JUST WATCH YOU FRICKIN'

18:49.461 --> 18:51.630
{\an8}ENJOY YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS COMPETITION.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.761
- I LOVE THE FLAMES
BEHIND HIM,

18:57.845 --> 18:59.513
AND THAT HIS FIST IS
JUST KIND OF, LIKE, A BALL...

18:59.596 --> 19:00.639
- OH, THE EXPLOSION HERE.
- YEAH.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.600
- THIS YELLOW AND ORANGE
BACKGROUND MAY BE SOMETHING

19:03.684 --> 19:05.310
THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO DO
IN THE TIMEFRAME.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.729
- I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT JUST
THE PORTRAIT OF THE FACE.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.231
MY BIG FEAR WAS I DIDN'T WANT
JUST HIM ON ME.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.818
I NEEDED SOME KIND OF OTHER
ELEMENTS TO BREAK IT UP.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.570
- I WOULD ASK YOU
IF YOU WOULD RECONSIDER.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.322
YOU'LL BE SOMETHING BIGGER

19:17.406 --> 19:19.199
THAT YOU CAN GET
MORE DETAIL INTO.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.576
- NO.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.494
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE I JUST KEEP
GETTING SCREWED.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.080
{\an8}SHE DEFINITELY WANTS WHAT IS
AN IMPOSSIBLE TATTOO

19:25.163 --> 19:26.248
{\an8}TO BE DONE.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.217
- YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
THAT SIZE?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.595
JESUS.
- YEAH, WHY?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.431
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING.
THAT'S BIG FOR SIX HOURS.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.933
JIME LITWALK'S DOING
ANOTHER JIME LITWALK TATTOO.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.894
IT'S A CARTOON,
NOT A COMIC.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.729
I WOULD TRY AND MAKE THAT
MORE DYNAMIC.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.105
IT JUST LOOKS A LITTLE FLAT.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.273
- MM-MM, NO.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.276
- I MEAN, I GUESS IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

19:54.359 --> 19:55.611
AND NOT DO THE CHALLENGE
LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.945
I DON'T KNOW.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.406
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU
ON DRAWING, SO--

19:59.489 --> 20:00.407
- I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR 20 YEARS.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.242
I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT JOEY'S OPINION.

20:02.326 --> 20:02.659
I GOT THIS.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.078
- HAVE FUN.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.831
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS TO
TATTOO YOUR CANVAS

20:07.915 --> 20:09.833
WITH A BADASS SUPERVILLAIN.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.295
AND YOUR TIME STARTS...

20:13.378 --> 20:14.963
NOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.006
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.716
{\an8}- THIS IS
ONE THOSE CHALLENGES

20:17.799 --> 20:19.968
{\an8}WHERE THE ARTISTS
HAVE TO REALLY RELY

20:20.052 --> 20:20.886
{\an8}ON THEIR TECHNICAL ABILITIES
TO TRANSLATE ART

20:20.969 --> 20:22.054
{\an8}THAT ALREADY EXISTS.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.306
THE CONSISTENCIES
IN THE DESIGN,

20:24.389 --> 20:26.975
AND THE TRANSLATION
OF THE TATTOO HAVE TO BE THERE

20:27.059 --> 20:29.186
SO THAT THAT IS
A RECOGNIZABLE CHARACTER.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.730
- I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY
PERFECT RIGHT HERE.

20:31.813 --> 20:35.859
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTED TO GET
DARKSEID FROM FEET TO HEAD.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.903
{\an8}IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
IN SIX HOURS.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.529
THIS TATTOO IS PROBABLY
THE ABSOLUTE HARDEST ONE

20:39.613 --> 20:41.240
THAT'S OUT THERE.
- OKAY.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.241
- HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
DOING THAT FACE THAT WE HAVE?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.160
- CAN YOU SHOW IT TO ME AGAIN?
- YEP.

20:45.243 --> 20:48.830
- MY IDEA IS TO THE HEAD UP
WITH GLOWING EYES.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.124
A MORE DYNAMIC-LOOKING
PICTURE ANYWAYS.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.668
- WOULD YOU BE DOING
THE BACKGROUND,

20:52.751 --> 20:54.503
OR WOULD IT JUST BE THE FACE?

20:54.586 --> 20:55.170
- I WOULD TRY TO
GET THE BACKGROUND.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.838
- OKAY.
- IT'S $100,000.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.423
WE'RE GONNA DO IT MY WAY.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.301
I WAS GETTING READY TO
TATTOO MYSELF AT THAT POINT

21:01.385 --> 21:02.803
IF SHE SAID, "NO," YOU KNOW?

21:02.886 --> 21:04.721
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.263
- ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

21:05.347 --> 21:09.017
[machines buzzing]

21:11.269 --> 21:13.981
{\an8}- DEFINITELY WANT TO TRY
AND BEAT JIME.

21:14.064 --> 21:14.940
{\an8}HE SNEAKED OUT THE WIN
LAST TIME.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.818
IT'S ALMOST, LIKE,
TRADITIONAL,

21:17.901 --> 21:19.194
WHICH IS KIND OF THE COOL
PART OF THIS CHALLENGE.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.404
I NEED TO BE CONSISTENT
IN REPRODUCING

21:20.487 --> 21:21.571
THE ACTUAL COMIC REFERENCE.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.699
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE TO
CHANGE THESE NEEDLES OUT

21:23.782 --> 21:26.410
TO SOMETHING SMALLER
JUST TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.202
IF I CAN NAIL THIS TATTOO,

21:27.285 --> 21:32.040
THEN I MIGHT HAVE
A CHANCE TO WIN.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.376
{\an8}- I TAKE WHAT I DO KNOW
OF POISON IVY

21:34.459 --> 21:37.129
{\an8}AND CREATE MY OWN VERSION
OF WHAT THIS CHARACTER IS.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.463
I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT
NEW SCHOOL'S EVER GONNA COME UP

21:38.547 --> 21:41.800
IN THE CHALLENGES,
BUT I FIGURE THIS IS ABOUT--

21:41.883 --> 21:43.135
ABOUT THE CLOSEST THING
THAT I'M GONNA GET TO REALLY--

21:43.218 --> 21:46.054
REALLY PUT IT OUT THERE, SO--

21:46.138 --> 21:47.305
THIS IS MY STYLE
OF TATTOOING, SO FOR ME,

21:47.389 --> 21:49.766
I'M IN A GOOD RUNNING TO
WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

21:49.850 --> 21:50.934
I'M SUPER STOKED.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.103
- FOUR MORE HOURS.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.235
{\an8}- THIS IS
WHAT I'M BOOKED OUT

22:00.318 --> 22:01.069
{\an8}FOR MONTHS, AND MONTHS,
AND MONTHS DOING,

22:01.153 --> 22:02.404
{\an8}IS THESE BEAUTIFUL PORTRAITS.

22:02.487 --> 22:06.700
{\an8}I REALLY WANT TO SHOW
THE INTENSITY OF THIS IMAGE,

22:06.783 --> 22:08.452
{\an8}AND THE CHARACTER OF BANE.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.746
{\an8}I'M JUST EXCITED TO SHOW
SOMETHING THAT I'M REALLY,

22:10.829 --> 22:11.830
{\an8}REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.123
{\an8}THING'S GONNA LOOK
[bleep] AWESOME.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.416
{\an8}THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE
SHOCKED WHEN I WIN.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.420
{\an8}- WHAT JOSHUA IS DOING
IS MORE TO THE REALISTIC SIDE,

22:18.503 --> 22:19.212
{\an8}AND THIS IS
A COMIC BOOK CHALLENGE.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.422
IF SOMETHING LOOKS
TOO REALISTIC,

22:20.505 --> 22:23.967
YOU AUTOMATICALLY DESERVE
TO BE IN THE BOTTOM.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.177
- ANYTHING REALISTIC,
YOU KNOW?

22:25.260 --> 22:27.220
I LOVE IT.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.765
- THE FACT THAT THE CHALLENGE
IS CONSISTENCY,

22:29.848 --> 22:32.017
I'M GONNA TATTOO THIS THING
LIKE YOU RIPPED IT OFF

22:32.100 --> 22:33.810
A COMIC BOOK PAGE.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.520
TWO DOLLARS A SINGLE NEEDLE.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.106
BEING SO METICULOUS
WITH THESE LINES

22:38.190 --> 22:40.650
IS TAKING ME FOREVER.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.236
I HAVE TO CUT THIS PIECE
IN HALF, OR THERE'S NO WAY

22:43.320 --> 22:44.696
THAT I'M GONNA FINISH THIS
TATTOO.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.115
THERE'S A LOT OF LINES.
I'M NOT GONNA DO ALL OF THIS.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.700
- THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

22:48.784 --> 22:49.993
- TATU BABY IS DOIN'
SOME REALLY WEIRD [bleep]

22:50.077 --> 22:52.496
WITH CUTTING THE BODY OFF,

22:52.579 --> 22:54.915
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T SEE
HOW SEE CAN TALK [bleep]

22:54.998 --> 22:58.085
TO ME ABOUT MY ARTISTRY,
AND THEN CUT THIS GUY IN HALF.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.962
TATU BABY SHOULD DEFINITELY
BE GOING HOME.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.590
- TWO HOURS REMAINING.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.347
- MY CANVAS REALLY WANTED
A BACKGROUND.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.473
I SHOULD'VE JUST
KEPT MY FOOT DOWN,

23:11.556 --> 23:14.267
SAID, "I DON'T HAVE
THE TIME TO DO IT PROPERLY."

23:14.351 --> 23:15.894
I HATE DOIN' BAD JOBS.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.813
MY BACKGROUND'S
NOT GONNA BE FINISHED.

23:17.896 --> 23:18.980
AT THIS POINT, I'M KIND OF
HOPING SOMEONE ELSE

23:19.064 --> 23:24.152
DROPS THE BALL.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.613
{\an8}- BECAUSE HE HAS A FRESH SCAR
GOING ACROSS HIS LEFT LEG,

23:26.696 --> 23:29.950
{\an8}I FLIP THE IMAGE, AND PUT IT
ON HIS RIGHT LEG INSTEAD.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.119
A FACE SHOULD ALWAYS FACE IN.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.413
- OH, YOU'RE DOING TWO-FACE?
- YEAH.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.331
- I'M DEFINITELY PULLING OUT
ALL THE AMMO.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.959
THERE'S SO MANY INCONSISTENT
LINES IN THIS,

23:39.042 --> 23:40.252
AND TODAY, WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO

23:40.335 --> 23:42.546
IGNORE THOSE INCONSISTENCIES,

23:42.629 --> 23:45.966
ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT'S
THE KEYWORD OF THE DAY.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.718
- FIFTEEN MINUTES REMAINING.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.387
{\an8}- ONCE AGAIN,
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE,

23:50.470 --> 23:51.596
{\an8}SO I RUSHED THE DAMN TATTOO.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.891
WISH I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE
TIME TO BLEND THINGS OUT.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.017
THIS SUCKS.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.187
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

23:59.271 --> 24:02.315
SEVEN, SIX, FIVE,

24:02.399 --> 24:07.154
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE...
THAT'S IT.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.239
TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

24:09.322 --> 24:09.948
NO MORE INK.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.868
- YOU ARE DONE.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.244
- HOLY [bleep].

24:14.327 --> 24:18.665
THAT'S EXACTLY
LIKE THE PICTURE.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.667
- I LOVE THE WAY THIS LOOKS.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.752
IT'S BADASS, MAN.
IT'S BADASS.

24:22.836 --> 24:26.214
- NOT SICK.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.091
- WOW.
- LOVE IT?

24:28.175 --> 24:30.135
- I LOVE IT.
I REALLY DO.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.721
- HE SCREWED THE POOCH.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.764
HE DID NOT
FOLLOW THE CHALLENGE.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.058
HE TOOK
A COMIC BOOK STYLE TATTOO,

24:37.142 --> 24:38.852
HE DID A BEAUTIFUL
NEW SCHOOL TATTOO.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.478
OKAY, JIME, DID YOU COME HERE

24:40.562 --> 24:42.189
JUST TO GET MORE
NEW SCHOOL BUSINESS,

24:42.272 --> 24:43.481
OR DID YOU COME HERE
TO COMPETE?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.070
{\an8}- WHATEVER YOU DO,
I DO IT BETTER.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.364
{\an8}- YOU [bleep] SUCK
AS AN ARTIST.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.408
{\an8}- YOU JACKED IT UP.
- YOU WANT TO WIN, OR NOT?

24:53.491 --> 24:54.701
{\an8}WHY ARE YOU IN THE BOTTOM?
BAD DECISIONS.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.254
- I'M SO DISAPPOINTED
IN MY WHOLE TRACK RECORD HERE.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.756
I KNOW
I'M A BETTER ARTIST, MAN.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.593
- I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME BEING
HERE IF I WERE BOTH OF YOU,

25:11.676 --> 25:12.594
CONSIDERING WHAT YOU GUYS
GOT GOING ON.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.639
- MY HOME LIFE
HAS CAUGHT UP WITH ME HERE,

25:15.722 --> 25:17.599
LIKE THIS SITUATION
WITH MY MOM AND STUFF.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.851
LIKE, EVERY DAY
I FEEL GUILTY FOR BEING HERE.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.271
I FEEL THAT ME AND KYLE HAVE
THE [bleep] END OF THE STICK

25:23.355 --> 25:25.106
WITH OUR HOME LIFE,
AND BEING ABLE TO

25:25.190 --> 25:27.400
STILL ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE'S
ACCOMPLISHING IS REALLY GOOD,

25:27.484 --> 25:28.777
AND I COMMEND HIM FOR IT.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.612
I WANT YOU TO [bleep]
STEP UP, SO YOU [bleep].

25:30.695 --> 25:32.781
'CAUSE I THINK THAT YOU GOT
A CHANCE TO WIN IT, DUDE.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.199
- KYLE'S--
KYLE'S THE DARK HORSE.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.450
- KEEP DOIN'
WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.952
TATTOO
YOUR [bleep] ASS OFF, YO.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.036
- BACKGROUND'S OUT.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.372
- NO, DON'T QUESTION ANYTHING
THAT YOU'RE DOIN'.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.290
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
A SLEEPER PERSON HERE.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.459
- NO.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.560
- ARTISTS, TODAY WE TESTED
YOUR CONSISTENCY

26:02.644 --> 26:07.565
BY ASKING YOU TO TATTOO
A BADASS SUPERVILLAIN.

26:07.649 --> 26:12.404
KYLE, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.531
- THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL
THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS FACE

26:14.614 --> 26:15.991
IS FANTASTIC.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.200
THE USE OF THE BLACK CREATES
ENOUGH DEPTH

26:17.284 --> 26:18.410
AND ENOUGH CONTRAST,

26:18.493 --> 26:20.662
TO WHERE YOU HAVE THE BLUE
AND THE GREEN

26:20.745 --> 26:23.373
TRANSITIONED TO THE FIERY RED
IN THE EYES,

26:23.456 --> 26:25.333
TO THE ORANGE, TO THE YELLOW,
AND IT LOOKS GREAT.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.169
WHERE YOU GET CHALLENGED
AGAIN IS YOUR BACKGROUND.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.963
THAT BLACK OVAL
THAT GOES AROUND THE OUTSIDE

26:30.046 --> 26:32.632
TAKES MY EYE AWAY FROM WHAT
I REALLY WANT TO BE LOOKING AT.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.051
- THERE'S THIS BALANCING ACT
THAT YOU HAVE HERE,

26:35.135 --> 26:36.177
WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GE
T A TATTOO DONE

26:36.261 --> 26:38.722
IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME.

26:38.805 --> 26:39.681
I MADE IT A SIZE THAT
I THOUGHT I COULD GET IT DONE,

26:39.764 --> 26:42.183
AND STILL GET THE BACKGROUND
SHE WANTED.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.352
- YELLOW ON PALE SKIN.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.979
YOU GOT TO HAVE
A LOT OF CONTRASTING COLOR

26:46.062 --> 26:47.772
TO MAKE THAT YELLOW STAND OUT.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.481
THAT'S YOUR
CONSISTENCY ISSUE HERE.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.734
BUT IT'S A VERY DARK IMAGE.

26:50.817 --> 26:51.443
YOU KNOW, HIS NAME IS
"DARKSEID."

26:51.526 --> 26:53.486
I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB

26:53.570 --> 26:54.612
PULLING OUT
A LOT OF HIGHLIGHTS

26:54.696 --> 26:55.405
AND SHOWING THE DETAILS
IN THERE.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.865
THE GLOW IN THE EYE?
VERY NICE.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.493
AND THE LITTLE SHINES OF RED
THAT COME AROUND OFF THAT.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.204
JUST THE FACT AT HOW
CONSISTENTLY ROUND THOSE ARE,

27:03.288 --> 27:05.415
THAT ONE LITTLE TRICK
IS HARD TO PULL OFF,

27:05.498 --> 27:07.500
AND I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB
GIVING CHARACTER TO THIS.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.169
- THANK YOU.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.464
[groans] I DIDN'T SEE
THAT ONE COMING AT ALL.

27:12.547 --> 27:16.551
- JOEY.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.303
- YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL,
"WOW"-FACTOR FOR ME.

27:18.386 --> 27:21.097
ALONG THE LEGS,
ALONG THE SIDES,

27:21.181 --> 27:24.893
TO SEE YOU INK ON YOUR CANVAS
WITH A SCISSOR HATCH,

27:24.976 --> 27:26.227
A STYLE THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH
FROM COMIC BOOKS.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.604
I WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED,

27:27.687 --> 27:29.564
'CAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH
TO DO IT ON PAPER

27:29.647 --> 27:31.775
AND YOU'RE PULLING IT OFF
ON SKIN.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.151
- I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
UNTIL I STARTED

27:33.234 --> 27:35.028
HOW MUCH TIME
THAT WAS GONNA TAKE.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.613
- YEAH.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.323
- SO I WAS, LIKE, SECOND
GUESSING MYSELF AT SOME POINTS.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.449
- WE'RE TRYING TO
JUDGE CONSISTENCY.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.951
THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE.

27:42.035 --> 27:42.869
EVERY LINE--BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,
BOOM, BOOM.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.746
THIS IS--VERY TEDIOUS
AMOUNT OF DETAIL

27:44.829 --> 27:48.917
YOU PUT INTO THIS THING,
AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR IT.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.587
- JACKIE.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.756
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF BEAT UP
LINE WORK IN THIS THING.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.216
- YOU JACKED IT UP.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.593
BECAUSE OF THE VERY THIN, WEAK
OUTLINES YOU DID IN THE FACE,

27:58.676 --> 27:59.594
IT DOESN'T LOOK SOLID,
IT LOOKS TOO WEAK.

27:59.677 --> 28:02.263
WE'VE BEEN BATTLING
LINE WORK ALL ALONG.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.515
- NOT ALL ALONG.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.933
CHRIS, IT'S NO DISRESPECT TO
YOU--

28:05.016 --> 28:06.267
- NO, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.685
BUT IT DOESN'T CONVEY
COMIC BOOK INKING.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.396
IT CONVEYS A SCRATCHY LINE.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.647
- CONSISTENCY.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.815
YOU MADE A MAJOR ALTERATION
TO IT.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.610
IT'S BACKWARDS.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.737
YOU FLIPPED IT, THEREFORE,
NOW HE'S BURNED

28:17.821 --> 28:19.155
ON THE OPPOSITE OF HIS BODY.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.950
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY ALTERING
THIS PSUEDO-HISTORY.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.618
- IT'D BE WRONG TO DO THAT,
FOR SURE.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.245
- THAT'S A CHOICE.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.663
- THE FLIPPED IMAGE
MAKES IT WRONG.

28:26.746 --> 28:31.918
- I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THAT.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.587
- JASON.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.215
- THIS IS PROBABLY
THE CLEANEST TATTOO

28:37.298 --> 28:38.383
WE'VE SEEN FROM YOU.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.468
THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT
CONSISTENCIES IN THIS TATTOO,

28:40.552 --> 28:42.637
THAT WE'VE SEEN LACKING
IN YOUR OTHER TATTOOS.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.806
- I'M STARTIN' TO FEEL
THE FLOW HERE,

28:44.889 --> 28:46.391
AND FEEL A LITTLE BIT
MORE COMFORTABLE

28:46.474 --> 28:48.393
GETTING RID OF SOME OF MY
ANXIETIES WHEN I'M TATTOOING.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.603
- I'M THE OPPOSITE OF OLIVER.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.147
I GOT TO CALL IT
LIKE I SEE IT.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.150
YOUR SATURATION, COLOR-WISE,
DOES NOT STACK UP.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.027
THESE TRANSITIONS FROM
THE BLACKS TO THE BLUES,

28:58.111 --> 29:01.156
AND THE VERY WASHED-OUT ORANGE
DO NOT DO IT FOR ME.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.157
- I ALWAYS THINK THAT
THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

29:02.240 --> 29:04.451
IN EVERY TATTOO.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.077
- YOUR CONSISTENCY
IN YOUR APPLICATION

29:06.161 --> 29:09.998
IS NOT GONNA STACK UP
AGAINST THESE GUYS TODAY.

29:10.081 --> 29:13.501
- JOSHUA.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.628
YOU HAD THE ADVANTAGE.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.006
WHAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY IN TERMS
OF HANDING OUT THE SKULLS?

29:18.089 --> 29:19.090
- WELL, THERE'S DEFINITELY
BEEN A LOT OF TALK

29:19.174 --> 29:21.509
ABOUT THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT
IN THE COMPETITION,

29:21.593 --> 29:22.927
AND I JUST WANTED TO
SHAKE THE TREE.

29:23.011 --> 29:23.428
- JOSH IS
LOWEST-HANGING FRUIT WE GOT.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.513
- GET HIM, KYLE.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.764
- HE'S PROVEN THAT TIME
AND TIME AGAIN.

29:26.848 --> 29:27.849
- IF YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME,

29:27.932 --> 29:29.058
LIKE HE'S BEEN CLAIMING
THE WHOLE TIME,

29:29.142 --> 29:30.810
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE SOME
OF THE STRONGEST GUYS,

29:30.894 --> 29:33.480
RIGHT AFTER A PIN-UP CHALLENGE,
TWO HOT CHICKS TO TATTOO?

29:33.563 --> 29:34.939
GO AFTER THE TOP, I THINK.

29:35.023 --> 29:35.815
- I JUST WANTED TO SEE THOSE
GUYS HAVE A GOOD DAY.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.359
- THAT'S A BULL[bleep] MOVE,
DUDE.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.736
YOU WANT TO GET ON THEIR GOOD
SIDE, HOPIN' THAT THEY WON'T

29:39.819 --> 29:41.112
SCREW YOU WHEN
THE TIME IS RIGHT

29:41.196 --> 29:42.363
FOR YOU TO GET SCREWED, DUDE.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.656
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, BRO.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.824
- I FEEL BADLY ABOUT EVERYBODY
FEELING SO ANGRY.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.869
I HOPE PEOPLE CAN DROP
THEIR PERSONAL FEELINGS, AND--

29:47.952 --> 29:50.205
AND MOVE ON TO JUST COMPETING
WITH THEIR ARTWORK.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.498
- THAT'S BULL[bleep], JOSH.
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.708
LET'S MOVE INTO YOUR TATTOO.

29:53.791 --> 29:55.835
- SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE EMBODIED
YOUR CHARACTER

29:55.919 --> 29:57.045
IN THIS COMPETITION.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.713
IT'S GOOD FOR
THE SUPERVILLAIN TO COME OUT,

29:58.796 --> 30:00.965
AND POUND ONE BACK
AT THE HEROES.

30:01.049 --> 30:01.799
WHETHER THEY LIKE YOU OR NOT,

30:01.883 --> 30:03.718
THEY GOT TO SUCK IT UP
AND BEAT IT.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.053
IT'S A REALLY NICE JOB.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.138
- OVERALL, THIS BEING
D.C. COMIC CHALLENGE,

30:07.222 --> 30:09.516
I THINK YOU REALLY CAPTURED
THE ESSENCE OF THIS CHARACTER.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.475
THE SMOOTH SHADING,
ALL THAT BLACK,

30:10.558 --> 30:12.769
AND ALL THAT DEEP SHADOWING

30:12.852 --> 30:14.229
THAT GIVES THE SHAPE OF
THE WRINKLES IN HIS FOREHEAD.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.647
VERY CONSISTENT.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.732
- YOU CAN DO [bleep]
THAT'S THIS COMPLEX,

30:17.815 --> 30:21.069
AND MAKE IT LOOK THIS GOOD,
THEN WHY ARE YOU LAGGING?

30:21.152 --> 30:23.571
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
DO THIS QUALITY ON EVERYTHING,

30:23.655 --> 30:27.075
ALL THE TIME.
- THANK YOU.

30:27.158 --> 30:30.411
- TATU BABY.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.872
HOW YOU FEELIN' THIS WEEK,
AS OPPOSED TO LAST WEEK?

30:32.956 --> 30:35.416
- I GUESS I FEEL A LITTLE BIT
BETTER, 'CAUSE I LET IT OUT.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.834
- WELL, WHAT YOU DID HERE,
I LOVE.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.003
I THINK YOU CAME BACK
REALLY, REALLY STRONG.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.672
THERE'S SOME INCREDIBLE DETAIL,
ESPECIALLY IN THE HAIR.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.549
THOSE TEETH ARE REALLY,
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

30:42.632 --> 30:43.925
THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU,

30:44.008 --> 30:46.844
WHY DOES IT JUST END
THE WAY IT DOES LIKE THAT?

30:46.928 --> 30:49.889
- I HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF ISSUES WITH TIME.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.724
DOING ALL THOSE LITTLE LINES,

30:51.808 --> 30:53.268
IF I WOULD'VE GONE
ANY LOWER,

30:53.351 --> 30:56.104
THEN IT WOULD'VE BROUGHT DOWN
THE QUALITY OF MY TATTOO.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.816
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE AT THE WAY
YOU CHOSE TO END THIS TATTOO.

30:59.899 --> 31:00.608
THE WAY HIS BODY'S CUT OFF,

31:00.692 --> 31:02.944
IT'S SUCH A HARSH,
STRAIGHT LINE.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.738
I UNDERSTAND YOU DID
WHAT YOU DID IN SIX HOURS.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.741
THERE'S NO WAY THIS GUY CAN
CONSIDER THIS A FINISHED TATTOO.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.618
- GREAT JOB THOUGH,
OVER ALL.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.287
THE TEXTURE IN THE JACKET,

31:12.370 --> 31:13.371
AND THE SMALL,
LITTLE, FINE DETAILS,

31:13.454 --> 31:19.127
WITH THE VERY FINE LINES
THAT YOU USED LOOK GREAT.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.755
- JIME.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.717
- THE BIG MARK THAT YOU MISSED
TODAY IS COMIC BOOK.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.635
YOU WENT AND DID SOMETHING
IN YOUR OWN STYLE,

31:27.719 --> 31:29.554
AND I SEE
A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE

31:29.637 --> 31:32.015
BETWEEN CARTOON STYLE
AND COMIC BOOK STYLE.

31:32.098 --> 31:35.643
- AS A GUY WHO DRAWS POISON IVY,
I THINK IT MISSED THE MARK.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.645
SHE SHOULD BE A SEDUCTRESS.
SHE'S NOT DRAWING ME IN.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.730
- I DON'T DRAW IT EVERYDAY.
SO THAT'S YOUR AREA.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.482
- WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,
I ASSUME.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.943
YOU MISSED IN CAPTURING
THE ESSENCE OF THIS CHARACTER.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.320
- BOTTOM LINE IS I'M 100% HAPPY
WITH WHAT I TURNED OUT.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.530
- THIS IS A GAME.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.115
THIS IS NOT
A COMIC BOOK TATTOO.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.742
TODAY, D.C. COMIC DAY.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.577
YOUR TATTOO SHOULD LOOK LIKE
A COMIC BOOK.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.828
- I EXECUTED THE TATTOO.

31:53.911 --> 31:55.163
I DID WHAT I DID,
AND I STAND BEHIND IT.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.080
WE KNOW YOU CAN DRAW.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PROVE THAT TO ANYBODY.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.668
WHAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE IS THAT
YOU CAN [bleep] OUT-GAME THESE

32:00.752 --> 32:02.253
OTHER [bleep] CHUMPS, MAN.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.839
IF YOU WANT TO [bleep] WIN
ON D.C. COMIC DAY,

32:04.922 --> 32:06.341
IF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A COMIC BOOK,

32:06.424 --> 32:07.717
YEAH, YOU GOT A SOLID TATTOO,

32:07.800 --> 32:09.886
AND THAT'S ONE PART
OF THE CHALLENGE.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.512
THE KEY TO THIS THING
IS SEEING

32:11.596 --> 32:14.057
ALL THE PARTS
OF THE CHALLENGE.

32:17.018 --> 32:21.189
- ARTISTS, THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

32:21.272 --> 32:25.652
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.278
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.030
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.872
- IF I GOT ELIMINATED
BEFORE JOSHUA, I'D LAUGH.

32:37.955 --> 32:40.208
I THINK HE SHOULD'VE BEEN
HOME A LONG TIME AGO,

32:40.291 --> 32:42.126
AND HE'S STILL HERE, SO--

32:42.210 --> 32:45.505
{\an8}AT THIS POINT, I'M SO [bleep]
OVERDONE WITH JOSHUA.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.590
{\an8}I DEFINITELY THINK THAT JOSHUA
GOT IT REALLY EASY

32:47.674 --> 32:49.467
{\an8}IN HIS CRITIQUE, AND I DON'T
THINK THAT IT'S FAIR.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.177
- YOU THINK I'VE BEEN DOING
TATTOOS WORSE

32:51.260 --> 32:53.179
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE,
BUT I HAVEN'T.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.472
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
I DO IT BETTER.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.556
- I DO GOOD TATTOOS.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.724
I DON'T [bleep] LINES UP,
OR SHADING, AND YOU DO.

32:56.808 --> 32:57.934
- WHETHER I'VE HAD FLAWS,

32:58.017 --> 33:00.019
I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
BETTER THAN YOU.

33:00.103 --> 33:03.022
THAT'S JUST A [bleep] FACT.
- WOW.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.107
SHE THROWS OUT ALL THE INSULTS
LIKE SHE'S SOME SORT OF--

33:04.190 --> 33:05.566
- WHAT, DO YOU EXPECT ME TO
[bleep] TALK TO YOU

33:05.650 --> 33:06.776
LIKE A REGULAR PERSON?

33:06.859 --> 33:07.944
NO, [bleep] YOU.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.404
YOU'RE GONNA [bleep]
TALK TO ME THAT WAY,

33:09.487 --> 33:10.905
I'M GONNA [bleep] TALK
TO YOU RIGHT BACK.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.573
- SHE THINKS SHE'S GOT
SOME SORT OF BIG HEART--

33:12.657 --> 33:14.492
- I DO HAVE A BIG HEART
FOR PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT,

33:14.575 --> 33:15.952
PEOPLE THAT I HAVE RESPECT FOR.

33:16.035 --> 33:16.494
BUT I DON'T HAVE
NO [bleep] RESPECT FOR YOU

33:16.577 --> 33:18.871
AS AN ARTIST, SO--

33:18.955 --> 33:19.956
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW MY WORK,
AND YOU FEEL LIKE--

33:20.039 --> 33:21.416
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
WHAT YOU TATTOO AT HOME,

33:21.499 --> 33:22.750
I KNOW WHAT THE [bleep]
YOU'VE SHOWN HERE,

33:22.834 --> 33:24.043
AND THAT'S ALL
I GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.420
- IF I'M JUDGING YOU
FOR THE WORK YOU'VE SHOWN HERE,

33:25.503 --> 33:29.132
THEN YOU [bleep] SUCK
AS AN ARTIST.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.591
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE [bleep] THING IS,

33:30.675 --> 33:32.051
IS I CAME IN HERE
A FAN OF YOURS.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.761
I'M JUST SHOCKED THAT YOU WOULD
BE A TOTAL CRAZY BITCH.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.805
- YEAH, I'M THE CRAZY BITCH.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.224
I THINK THE ONLY BITCH HERE
IS YOU.

33:43.146 --> 33:46.941
[dramatic music]

33:47.024 --> 33:48.276
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, TODAY.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.777
CONSISTENCY WITH
THE D.C. CHARACTERS.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.195
HOW'D OUR FIELD DO OVERALL?

33:51.279 --> 33:53.156
- CAPTURING THE CHARACTERS
OF THE COMICS,

33:53.239 --> 33:54.741
MOST PEOPLE DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.242
- WHO'S THE TOP OF THE PACK
TODAY?

33:56.325 --> 33:57.535
- I LOVE JOEY'S WORK.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.412
CATWOMAN
JUST CAME OUT SPECTACULAR.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.372
THE PLAYFULNESS,
THE DANGER, THE POSE.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.623
HE CAPTURES EVERYTHING.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.625
- JUST THE BLACK THAT HE HAD
IN IT WITH HIS LINE WORK

34:04.709 --> 34:06.127
MAKES IT A REAL BANG-UP TATTOO.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.880
- AND JOSHUA, WHO DID BANE,
THAT'S A CLEAR WINNER.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.717
IT REALLY CAPTURES THAT FEROCITY
WE EXPECT TO SEE IN BANE.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.010
- SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES
HE PULLED OFF,

34:14.092 --> 34:14.969
LIKE JUST THE GLOW AROUND
THE EYES,

34:15.052 --> 34:16.763
IT'S IMPRESSIVE
IT REALLY HAS A GLOW.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.056
- WHO DO YOU THINK'S
IN THE BOTTOM?

34:18.139 --> 34:20.308
- JASON.
HE'S GOT SOME INCONSISTENCIES

34:20.391 --> 34:23.186
LIKE HIS SATURATION ISSUES
WITH HIS BLACK SMOOTH TO COLOR.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.271
THIS IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST
TATTOOS HE'S DONE,

34:25.353 --> 34:28.733
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE NARROWED DOWN
TO ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT,

34:28.815 --> 34:29.650
HE'S STILL IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE PACK.

34:29.734 --> 34:30.860
- JACKIE'S TWO-FACE.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.612
- THIS CHARACTER IS BURNED
ON HIS LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY

34:33.696 --> 34:34.739
IN THE STORYLINE.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.908
NOW,
SHE'S TOTALLY REVERSED IT.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.159
HE'S BURNED ON
THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS BODY.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.536
YOU GO MESSIN' [bleep] UP
OR JUST SAYIN',

34:40.620 --> 34:41.496
"OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT--"
IT DOES MATTER.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.830
PUT ALL THAT [bleep] ASIDE,
THIS TATTOO,

34:42.914 --> 34:45.458
IT'S RIDDLED
WITH INCONSISTENCIES.

34:45.541 --> 34:46.958
THE REFERENCE, IT'S VIBRANT.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.085
HER TATTOO, IT'S MUDDIED UP.
THE VIBRANCY'S GONE.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.505
- SHE JUST WENT OFF THE GRID
ON THIS WHOLE ENTIRE TATTOO.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.341
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
I THINK WE HAVE A DECISION.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.009
{\an8}- YEAH.
- SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DECIDE

34:55.092 --> 34:57.345
{\an8}WHICH ARTIST
GAVE THE WORST TATTOO.

34:57.428 --> 35:00.264
- MY ARTIST IS JACKIE,
AND THIS IS TWO-FACE.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.849
- THERE COULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE MORE OF A CONTRAST

35:01.933 --> 35:03.226
BETWEEN THE FACE TO THE SUIT--

35:03.309 --> 35:05.603
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE FADING
INTO THE BACKGROUND.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.188
THE HAIR, I THINK,
LACKS TEXTURE.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.857
- IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE
JUST A WHITE CLOUD.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.567
- YOU GUYS ARE REACHING,
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST PHENOMENAL.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.654
YOU GOT TO AGREE.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.781
- MY ARTIST IS JIME,
AND THIS IS POISON IVY.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.533
- HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE I CAN
PEE MORE COLORS

35:18.616 --> 35:20.034
THAN THAT TATTOO HAS.

35:20.117 --> 35:21.619
IT LOOKS LIKE A GREEN BLOB.

35:21.702 --> 35:22.537
- HER BOOBS ARE WEIRD.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.413
LIKE, IF YOU LOOK AT
HER LEFT SHOULDER,

35:24.497 --> 35:26.374
IT'S WAY BACK HERE.
- YEAH.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.458
- YET HER LEFT BOOB IS, LIKE,
OUT HERE.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.169
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE JOLLY GREEN
GIANT'S DAUGHTER.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.755
- HE DECIDED TO DEVIATE
FROM THE CHALLENGE,

35:32.839 --> 35:34.048
WHICH WAS A COMIC BOOK
CHALLENGE.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.676
HAS ANYBODY SEEN A COMIC BOOK
THAT LOOKS ANYTHING LIKE THIS?

35:36.759 --> 35:37.885
NO.
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.011
- HE DID TRY TO MAKE IT INTO
HIS OWN CHARACTER.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.264
- PERSONALLY, I FEEL LIKE
IT WAS THE WORST.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.307
- WAIT TILL YOURS GOES UP,
BUDDY.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.018
- MY ARTIST WAS JOSHUA,
AND I GOT BANE FROM <i> BATMAN.</i>

35:46.102 --> 35:49.063
- THE LEFT SIDE,
THAT RIP LOOKS LIKE A HORN.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.690
BANE'S MASK DOESN'T HAVE
A HORN, RIGHT?

35:50.773 --> 35:52.733
- NO.
- IT LOOKS LIKE HIS LEFT EYE

35:52.817 --> 35:54.277
IS LOWER THAN THE RIGHT.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.444
- BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT ACTUALLY SLOPES DOWN.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.447
- I THINK IT'S COMMON SENSE
THAT MY LEG IS SWOLLEN.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.658
- SWELLING'S NOT GONNA MAKE
HIS LEFT SIDE DROOP

36:00.741 --> 36:02.660
LIKE HE HAD LIKE
A MINOR STROKE.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.829
- IT'S [bleep] SICK,
AND IF YOU GUYS DISAGREE,

36:04.912 --> 36:07.707
THEN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO GET AN EYE EXAM.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.292
- SO THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
HAS COME TO A DECISION.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.386
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.555
WE WANT TO SEE JASON,

36:22.638 --> 36:26.517
JOEY,

36:26.601 --> 36:29.186
JACKIE,

36:29.270 --> 36:30.938
AND JIME.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.316
SEE YOU ALL IN THE SHOP.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.526
- I STAND 100% BEHIND MY TATTOO.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.028
WHAT ABOUT YOU TWO?

36:37.111 --> 36:39.655
- I'M JUST TRYING NOT TO HAVE
A PANIC ATTACK.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.907
- TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS.
RELAX.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.702
- MY PANIC DISORDER IS KIND OF
GETTING THE BEST OF ME LATELY.

36:44.785 --> 36:45.661
IT JUST MAKES ME EMOTIONAL,

36:45.745 --> 36:47.455
'CAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I'M EVEN HERE.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.541
- WELL, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF
YOURSELF THAT YOU DID IT.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.375
ARE YOU GUYS READY?
- YEAH.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.961
- LET'S GO HAVE IT.
- GOOD LUCK.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.092
- TODAY, WE ASKED YOU TO SHOW
CONSISTENCY

37:00.176 --> 37:02.053
BY TATTOOING A SUPERVILLAIN.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.138
ONE OF YOUR SUPERVILLAINS
WAS BADASS,

37:04.221 --> 37:07.224
BUT THREE WERE MEDIOCRE.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.268
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED THAT
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

37:13.481 --> 37:14.815
GOES TO JOEY.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.735
- JOEY, YOU CAPTURED
THE ESSENCE, THE PLAYFULNESS,

37:17.818 --> 37:18.945
THE DANGER OF CATWOMAN.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.405
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS PEELED FROM
THE PAGES OF THE COMICS

37:21.489 --> 37:23.074
AND PASTED ON FLESH.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.993
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.663
- JACKIE, JASON, JIME.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.832
ANY ONE OF YOU COULD
JUSTIFIABLY BE SENT HOME.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.669
JIME, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY VOTED

37:34.752 --> 37:37.797
THAT YOU HAD THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.423
- I STAND BEHIND MY TATTOO.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.299
NOT EVERYONE'S GONNA LIKE
WHAT I DO,

37:40.383 --> 37:42.843
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING IT
FOR 20 YEARS.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.011
- BUT YOU CAN'T STYLIZE
SOMETHING TO THE POINT

37:44.095 --> 37:46.430
WHERE IT'S UNRECOGNIZABLE.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.807
THIS IS NOT POISON IVY.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.685
IT'S A CUTESY LITTLE CARTOONY
GREEN CREATURE.

37:50.768 --> 37:51.394
YOU'VE MISSED THE ESSENCE.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.187
- CAN'T MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.

37:53.270 --> 37:53.980
- YOU WANT TO WIN, OR NOT?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.231
- I DO WANT TO WIN.
YEAH.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.900
- WHY ARE YOU IN THE BOTTOM?
BAD DECISIONS.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.318
YOU GOT A ROOMFUL
OF EIGHT COMIC BOOK NERDS.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.655
THE REASON THEY CAME HERE
TO GET A [bleep] TATTOO

38:02.738 --> 38:04.073
IS 'CAUSE THEY LOVE
COMIC BOOKS.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.533
THEY'RE GONNA PICK
THE ONE THEY LEAST,

38:05.616 --> 38:07.243
WHICH ONE ARE THEY GONNA PICK?

38:07.326 --> 38:09.412
THE ONE THAT DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE A COMIC BOOK.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.497
THAT'S YOURS.
THAT WAS YOUR DECISION.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.207
IF YOU DRAW FOR D.C. COMICS,

38:13.290 --> 38:15.126
THE EDITOR'S GONNA BE LIKE,
"THAT'S NOT THE D.C. LOOK.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.794
BETTER TAKE YOUR ASS
TO <i> GARFIELD."</i>

38:16.877 --> 38:19.380
- I DID TAKE A RISKY MOVE
IN MAKING AN ARTISTIC DESIGN,

38:19.463 --> 38:21.757
BUT A LOT OF ELEMENTS
THAT WERE TATTOOED TODAY

38:21.841 --> 38:24.218
WON'T BE HERE IN A WHILE.
JOEY DID AN AMAZING TATTOO.

38:24.301 --> 38:25.886
HATCH WORK IN THAT WHIP
THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH--

38:25.970 --> 38:27.179
AIN'T GONNA BE THERE
IN TEN YEARS.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.723
- JOEY'S TATTOO IS SOLID,

38:28.806 --> 38:31.225
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
LOOK TERRIBLE DOWN THE ROAD.

38:31.308 --> 38:33.519
THIS IS A GAME, AND JOEY PLAYED
THE RIGHT GAME TODAY.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.062
D.C. COMIC DAY.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.897
YOUR TATTOO SHOULD LOOK LIKE
A COMIC BOOK.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.526
IT'S THE SIMPLEST
OF ALL SIMPLE RULES.

38:40.609 --> 38:41.152
- JACKIE.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.320
- IF THIS WAS MY TATTOO,

38:43.404 --> 38:46.198
THE FACT THAT THE WRONG SIDE OF
THE FACE IS BURNED WOULD BUG ME.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.408
- I FELL SHORT A LITTLE TODAY,

38:47.491 --> 38:50.286
BUT I THINK THAT YOU CAN SEE
THAT I'M A GOOD ARTIST.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.413
YOU KNOW, MY MOM'S SICK,

38:52.496 --> 38:54.373
AND THE REASON WHY I CAME
IS FOR HER TO SEE ME

38:54.457 --> 38:56.500
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING IN LIFE
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:56.584 --> 39:00.129
- WELL, NO MATTER HOW THE CHIPS
FALL, SHE'S SEEIN' THAT.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.089
- YEAH, BUT I WANT HER
TO SEE ME WIN IT.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.299
I THINK IF I PULL MY HEAD
OUT OF MY ASS,

39:03.382 --> 39:05.009
I HAVE A LOT TO
OFFER YOU GUYS.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.886
- IF THAT'S DISTRACTING YOU,
THEN OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO YOU.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.429
YOU'RE IN THE FINAL EIGHT,

39:08.512 --> 39:11.640
AND THERE'S A STRONG TECHNICAL
FIELD WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

39:11.724 --> 39:16.604
AND THIS TATTOO JUST DOES NOT
REPRESENT THAT FOR YOU.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.064
- JASON.
- ALL IN ALL,

39:18.147 --> 39:19.315
THIS IS ONE OF YOUR BETTER
TATTOOS,

39:19.398 --> 39:20.024
BUT THE COLORS
AREN'T AS SATURATED

39:20.107 --> 39:22.068
AS SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE'S.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.611
YOU AND JACKIE
ARE BATTLING IT OUT.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.446
- I KNOW YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW
ABOUT MY PAST,

39:25.529 --> 39:27.114
BUT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH
PANIC DISORDER FOR YEARS.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.242
LAST TWO WEEKS
BEFORE I GOT HERE,

39:30.326 --> 39:32.119
I SPENT TRYING TO RIDE UP
ESCALATORS AT THE MALL

39:32.203 --> 39:34.455
JUST TO OVERCOME MY ANXIETIES
AND PANIC.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.624
I DON'T WANT IT TO SOUND LIKE
A "WOE IS ME" STORY,

39:36.707 --> 39:40.795
BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT I'M NOT
SHOWING YOU GUYS OR AMERICA

39:40.878 --> 39:42.379
ANYTHING OF WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.089
I'M A GOOD TATTOOER,
AND I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE

39:43.172 --> 39:45.382
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.553
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.679
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.148
JACKIE, YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.109
- THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES HERE.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.360
THIS LATE IN THE GAME,

40:04.443 --> 40:06.987
STILL SHOWING THESE TECHNICAL
IMPERFECTIONS CAN HURT YOU.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.490
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES,
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.618
- I DEFINITELY SAW MYSELF
GOING FURTHER.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.496
IT SUCKS, BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT I CAN WIN THIS.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.665
I KNOW THAT I'M A VERY
WELL-ROUNDED ARTIST.

40:17.748 --> 40:22.002
MY MOM, I WANTED HER TO SEE ME,
YOU KNOW, GO TO THE END.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.133
narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:27.216 --> 40:30.136
- WELCOME TO CONEY ISLAND,
GUYS.

40:30.219 --> 40:34.014
- FOR THIS FLASH CHALLENGE,
YOU MUST TATTOO THE EYELIDS.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.057
- HOLY [bleep].

40:35.141 --> 40:37.309
- ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?
AN ACTUAL EYELID.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.811
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
PART OF THAT.

40:38.894 --> 40:41.188
- WOW. YOU CAN
SCREW SOMEONE'S VISION UP.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.523
- I HAVE MY FACE TATTOOED.
- I THINK IT'S STUPID.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.359
- WHO THE [bleep] ARE YOU
TO CALL IT STUPID?

40:45.442 --> 40:46.402
- BECAUSE I KNOW--
- YOU DON'T KNOW [bleep].

40:46.485 --> 40:48.946
- THIS THING
IS HARSHLY UNAPPEALING.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.197
- YOU SHOULD'VE
STUCK WITH YOUR GUT.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.032
- THAT'S YOUR MISTAKE.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.534
- THE JUDGES ARE AGREED THAT WE
DON'T NEED A DELIBERATION.
