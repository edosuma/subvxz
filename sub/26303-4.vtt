WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:11.533
.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.839
- Three nights in a row.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.015
- That'd be four nights
in a row.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.451
- Well then, forget it.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.669
- You're gonna cut me off
at three nights in a row?

00:17.713 --> 00:18.888
Three?
- Uh-huh.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.324
- There's no way.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
Good night.
- Hey.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.763
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:26.548 --> 00:27.636
- Did you guys hear,

00:27.679 --> 00:29.333
the detective exam
was just announced?

00:29.377 --> 00:30.856
- Yeah, I heard something
about that.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.989
- Oh, man, that exam
is brutal.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.425
- Yeah.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.123
If you're gonna take it,
start studying now.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.386
- Oh, that's encouraging.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.913
So can I walk you out?

00:43.956 --> 00:45.262
Do men still do that?

00:45.306 --> 00:47.047
That's not sexist
or anything, right?

00:47.090 --> 00:48.178
Look at that,
it's a gentleman's arm.

00:48.222 --> 00:51.616
- Stop it.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.705
- Been talking to my dad,
he's not so sure

00:53.749 --> 00:55.533
the detective thing's
a great idea.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.274
More lawsuits.
More eyes.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.711
But that big city badge--
that would look...

00:59.755 --> 01:00.973
pretty good on my hip.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.453
How 'bout you?

01:02.497 --> 01:03.889
- I don't know.
I'm thinking it over.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.195
"

01:05.239 --> 01:06.544
You've been dreaming
about this

01:06.588 --> 01:07.937
since your first day
in the Academy.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.025
I don't believe you
for a second.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.072
First Deputy Brennan
would like a word.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.249
- Yes, ma'am.
This way.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.086
- Gun violence isn't
the whole story.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.566
Overall crime is down 9%.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.438
No, it's not fake news.
Do you know what?

01:30.481 --> 01:32.744
I am sick of people
saying it's fake news.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.572
I gotta jump.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.921
Hi, Kim.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.750
I wanted to congratulate you

01:38.794 --> 01:40.230
on the Jorge Luna bust.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.885
I read all the IPR's and
the supplementary reports.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.149
- I read everyone's reports.

01:46.193 --> 01:49.065
That's how I know you got
those kids out of harm's way.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.285
- That was a team
effort, ma'am.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.113
- Don't run away
from a compliment.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.506
Gets you nowhere.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.554
I need a favor.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.427
Last week...

02:03.471 --> 02:05.603
I met a pastor--
Aqueela Barnes.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.170
Have you heard of her?
- Yeah.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.650
She has quite a following
on the West Side.

02:08.693 --> 02:09.955
- Yes, she does.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.783
Her daughter wants
to be a cop.

02:11.827 --> 02:15.265
- Oh. Okay, I can arrange
a ride along with Patrol.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.572
- Or you could take
her out yourself.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.053
As a part of his campaign,
Kelton is rebooting

02:21.097 --> 02:22.620
the Explorers Program.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.057
We've put a lot of time,
a lot of resources into it.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.537
I wanna show it off.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.452
Preferably with
an up-and-coming young,

02:28.496 --> 02:30.585
female cop
on our most elite unit.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.373
Here's her card.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.158
In case you find
the time in your schedule.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.638
- Yeah.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.253
- Whoa-oh, look at you,
sporting the old blues.

02:46.296 --> 02:49.299
Just like old times.
They look a little tight.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.953
- Don't expect a coffee run.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.650
- Your ride along's here.
You clear it with Voight?

02:52.694 --> 02:54.435
- Yes. I know what
I'm doing, Trudy.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.350
- You remember the rules.
Civilian in the car.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.091
Do not engage.
And bring me back a latte.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.310
Real milk.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.746
- Hey, Kendra.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.444
Hi, I'm Officer Kim Burgess.
How you doing?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.315
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.664
- Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.100
I know how busy
you must be, ma'am.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.972
- Ooh, let's lose
the "ma'am," okay?

03:10.015 --> 03:13.236
- Oh--sorry.
My mom likes me to be formal.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.151
- That's okay.
Grab your backpack.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.848
It's cute. K for Kendra?

03:16.892 --> 03:19.590
- Nah. It's actually um--
it's actually K for Kendrick.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.505
- I like it.

03:21.549 --> 03:24.204
- So why do you wanna
be a cop, Kendra?

03:25.553 --> 03:27.337
- I'm just tired
of people being shot.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.774
So, rather than bitch
and moan and just--

03:32.037 --> 03:33.517
Oh, sorry.

03:33.561 --> 03:36.216
- That's okay.
Cops are allowed to curse.

03:36.259 --> 03:40.263
- Well, rather than complain,

03:40.307 --> 03:42.352
I just figured I'd
do something about it.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.311
You know?
Try to make a difference.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.095
- Just like your mom.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.228
- Mmm--not exactly.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.881
I mean, I believe
in God and everything,

03:49.925 --> 03:52.928
but he's not gonna
fix Chicago all by himself.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.886
- I got a hit
on a robbery crew.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.541
Guy named Clay Young.
Drives a red 2004 Mustang.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.849
Illinois tags.
1-4 Eddie Paul Sam 9-6.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.416
My CI thinks they're
going to hit a house

04:02.459 --> 04:04.069
on Stone Street, like soon.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.854
- Stone Street.
We just passed that.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.248
- If anyone's close, take a
peak. Stay in the shadows.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.250
- We're gonna check
it out, right?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.860
- No, not with
you in the car.

04:11.903 --> 04:12.991
- Come on, Officer.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.863
- No, Kendra.
It's not a good idea.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.822
- But how am I supposed to
learn if I don't see anything?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.739
Please.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.274
- Now we're gonna put your
police skills to the test.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.583
Okay Kendra.
See that red Mustang?

04:39.627 --> 04:40.845
- Yeah.
- Does that match the plates

04:40.889 --> 04:42.934
we're looking for?
- Sure does.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.328
EPS.
Eddie, Paul, Sam.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.503
- Whoo.
Nice work, Officer.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.026
Jay.
I got our Mustang.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.593
- Any sign of our suspect,
Clay Young.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.291
Male, white, six

04:51.334 --> 04:52.466
- No. The car's parked
on the corner.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.468
No one's inside.
I gotta head out.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.082
- Get down!
Get down!

05:00.952 --> 05:03.303
- 5021 Eddie.
Emergency, multiple shots fired

05:03.346 --> 05:04.956
coming from
1520 West Stone Street.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.915
I am pinned in.
I got one down.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.133
Roll an ambulance!

05:09.613 --> 05:10.875
You stay here!

05:10.919 --> 05:12.877
You understand me?
Stay here!

05:16.664 --> 05:17.969
Sir, are you hurt?
- No.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.144
- Get behind me, now!

05:19.188 --> 05:20.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

05:20.494 --> 05:21.930
That's right--
go, go, go, go!

05:21.973 --> 05:23.627
Sir, I saw you're hurt.
I saw you're hurt.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.194
I'm coming to you.
Can you hook my arm?

05:25.237 --> 05:27.370
Let's go, come on.
Let's do this together, buddy.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.937
You got this!
Help me out.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.418
All right. Don't worry,
an ambulance is coming.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.636
Okay?
You stay with me.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.377
All right.
Hold on, okay?

05:34.421 --> 05:36.336
Hold up--
Chicago PD!

05:37.424 --> 05:39.034
Drop that weapon!

05:39.077 --> 05:41.428
10-1, 10-1! Shots fired by
offender and the police.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.907
Offender on foot
in the alley,

05:42.951 --> 05:45.867
heading eastbound towards
State. Gray hoodie.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.651
Sir! I'm coming back
to you, sir!

05:47.695 --> 05:49.697
You're okay.
You're okay.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.176
Stay with me.
I'm not leaving you.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.396
Stay with me.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.405
- He took one to the chest.
Clear that house!

06:02.449 --> 06:05.321
- Copt that.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.845
Kendra!
Are you all right?

06:07.889 --> 06:10.326
Kendra?
It's me, okay?

06:10.370 --> 06:17.551
♪

06:25.210 --> 06:26.690
Kendra!

06:27.082 --> 06:30.085
♪

06:32.653 --> 06:34.829
- Two offenders broke in
through the back door.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.397
They entered the dining room,
started opening drawers.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.964
- Homeowner comes in,
surprised 'em.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.227
- Yeah, he took two
to the chest.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.881
Name's John McCaffery.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.709
Looks like
the third shot missed,

06:45.753 --> 06:47.102
went through the window.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.409
- And that's the one
that hit the pedestrian?

06:49.452 --> 06:51.236
- Yeah, bad time for a walk.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.456
McCaffery fires back,
clips Offender Number One.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.066
Meet Clay Young.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.546
- Do we know what happened
to the second offender?

06:56.590 --> 06:58.156
- He hightails it
through a side door,

06:58.200 --> 06:59.549
engages with Officer Burgess.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.769
- Talked to Robbery.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.335
They think this
is the same crew

07:03.379 --> 07:05.599
that's been hitting the Gold
Coast the past few weeks.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.078
- Yeah, I figured.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.297
All right, thanks, Cullen.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.907
Hey, uh, what about the wife?

07:09.951 --> 07:13.563
- Once the shooting started,
I hid in the bathroom.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.043
I should have done
something.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.740
- No, no. You didn't
do anything wrong.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.264
- I tried to save him--

07:19.308 --> 07:20.744
She needs to get to Med.

07:20.788 --> 07:23.138
- I'm so sorry
for your loss.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.316
- Hey.
Where's Burgess?

07:27.359 --> 07:28.926
- I don't know.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.841
- All right,
what do we got?

07:30.885 --> 07:32.103
- Two offenders
that we know of.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.496
They came in through
the back courtyard.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.845
The wife didn't see much.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.804
- We've got
two DOAs inside.

07:36.847 --> 07:39.502
The homeowner, John McCaffery,
and one of the bad guys.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.897
A, uh, Clay Young,
male, white, 37.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.552
He's got a long sheet.
Burglary. Meth distro.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.944
No gang ties, though.

07:46.988 --> 07:49.294
Wife said her husband
had a gun,

07:49.338 --> 07:51.732
and he's the one that opened
fire on this Clay Young guy.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.473
- And during the shootout,
a bullet came through

07:53.516 --> 07:54.909
the window and
hit a civilian here.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.606
- Wife get a look a look
at the other offender?

07:56.650 --> 07:57.955
- She caught a glimpse, but
she ducked into the bathroom

07:57.999 --> 07:59.479
when the bullets
started flying.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.784
She said, white male,
tall, gray hoodie.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.525
- Same guy that opened
up on Kim.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.005
I have two witnesses
that saw a big guy

08:04.048 --> 08:05.528
with a gray hoodie
run out of the house,

08:05.572 --> 08:07.095
shooting at
a police officer.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.966
- All right, chase Young's
knowns, dump his phone.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.839
Talk to neighbors,
check all nearby PODS.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.624
- Excuse me!

08:14.668 --> 08:16.757
- Look, it all happened
really fast, okay?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.236
There was a man
down, bleeding.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.977
I told Kendra to duck,
to stay in the car--

08:20.021 --> 08:21.805
- Hold on a second, the girl
was in the car with you?

08:21.849 --> 08:23.851
- Yeah, I was
on a ride along.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.635
But now I can't find her.

08:25.679 --> 08:26.984
I went back to check on her,
and she's gone--

08:27.028 --> 08:28.072
- Go find her now.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.292
We'll talk about
the other stuff later.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.819
- Excuse me, sir,
have you seen this girl?

08:35.863 --> 08:37.038
- Uh-uh, no, sorry.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.605
Why?
Did something happen to her?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.476
- If you do see her,
can you please call me?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.869
- Oh, sure, sure.
I'll ask around.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.653
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.829
- Yo. I heard you
took fire.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.049
You okay?
- I'm fine.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.618
- Kim.
Kim, look at me.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.663
You don't look fine.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.535
Are you sure?

08:56.797 --> 08:59.147
- I had a ride along
with me, she ran.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.411
- Well, just find her.
- I've been looking.

09:02.454 --> 09:05.545
- It's okay.
Um...

09:05.588 --> 09:08.765
There's a bus stop right there.
Maybe she took the bus home.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.506
Let me see the picture.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.334
- Maybe...

09:19.254 --> 09:21.343
- Mrs. Barnes,
I'm officer Burgess.

09:21.386 --> 09:24.389
We spoke yesterday.
There's been an incident--

09:24.433 --> 09:26.217
Kendra!
Are you okay?

09:26.261 --> 09:28.524
Mrs. Barnes,
may I please come in?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.613
I would love to speak
to Kendra.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.617
- I'm sorry about
all of this.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.053
When that guy started
shooting at you,

09:36.097 --> 09:37.098
I got scared.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.708
So, I ran into
a coffee shop,

09:38.752 --> 09:40.580
and I started freaking out
a little bit.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.451
But then this nice lady
walked into the bus stop.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.192
Gave me some money,
and told me to go home.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.759
- So, let me get this
straight, Officer Burgess.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.717
You were out with
my daughter on a ride,

09:47.761 --> 09:49.806
and you drove smack-dab
into a shootout?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.721
How does that happen?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Barnes.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.375
I certainly didn't mean
for this to happen.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.638
There was an emergency call,
a man was shot.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.118
I did what I thought
was right--

09:57.161 --> 09:59.033
- No disrespect,
Ms. Barnes, but my partner

09:59.076 --> 10:01.557
is being extremely humble.
She tried to save a man's life.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.212
- And almost got my daughter
killed in the process.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.561
- Mom.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.823
I appreciate you
stopping by.

10:06.867 --> 10:07.955
But if there's nothing else--

10:07.998 --> 10:09.652
- There is.
I'm sorry.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.132
Kendra, I have to ask you:
did you happen to see

10:11.175 --> 10:13.308
the man with the gun?
He was wearing a gray hoodie.

10:15.963 --> 10:19.314
- No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.445
- There.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.143
- Thank you.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.626
- So, we recovered a laptop
in Clay Young's apartment that

10:26.669 --> 10:29.150
traces back to a Gold Coast
robbery from two weeks ago.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.673
- Well, that's good.
But Young's dead.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.675
Do we have anything on
the second offender?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.634
- Nothing so far.
- Nah, we got a name.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.287
This is, uh,
Trent Stow.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.942
Techs found his fingerprints
all over the Mustang.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.857
- Long and impressive.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.424
He's a repeat violent
offender, this guy.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.818
- Two armed robberies,
three narcotics charges.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.471
Looks like he's into
meth, coke, and heroin.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.299
- All right. That makes sense,
'cause the M.E. said

10:48.343 --> 10:50.214
they found high doses
of meth in Young's system.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.347
- All right. So we've
got two hopped-up junkies

10:52.390 --> 10:53.957
robbing to support their habit.

10:54.001 --> 10:57.178
Besides drugs, we find
a nexus between Stow and Young?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.876
- Yeah, they were busted
ten years ago for a robbery

10:59.920 --> 11:01.356
when they were
in college at CCU.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.271
Stow actually played
quarterback for a season.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.055
- He was a pro prospect
until he beat

11:05.099 --> 11:06.666
a kid into a coma at a bar.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.233
The judge was an alum,
so he got off with probation.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.887
- He's been busted a few
times for robberies,

11:10.931 --> 11:12.193
never convicted.
This kid's been getting

11:12.236 --> 11:13.934
a free pass
his entire life.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.892
- Hey Kim,
you recognize this guy?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.981
- No.
All I saw was a hoodie.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.505
- All right.
Bring in Trent Stow.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.160
See if the wife of
the victim can ID him.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.860
Burgess.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.037
How's your
ride along doing?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.821
- Oh, she's fine,
thank God.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
I never should have engaged
with her in the car.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.695
- Technically, yes,
but, you did

11:35.738 --> 11:36.913
what you thought
was right.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.828
- Yeah. Well, let's hope
the review team

11:38.872 --> 11:40.177
feels the same way.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.918
- Tomorrow.

11:41.962 --> 11:45.008
Any advice?
- Yeah, just tell the truth.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.010
Look, you tried
to save a man's life.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.751
Ride along or no
ride along,

11:48.795 --> 11:50.405
they're gonna understand.

11:50.448 --> 11:51.536

St. Mary's.

hoodie, Trent?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.928

a home invasion murder,

two kids, was shot and killed.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.461

to do with that.

as a quarterback coach

15:42.115 --> 15:43.594

He's clean and sober.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.861
You people are making
a big mistake.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.428

you wouldn't mind coming

doing a lineup.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.562
- No.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.390
But since he's so innocent,
I'm assuming

15:56.433 --> 15:57.782
that he'd want to do
it of his own free will.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.262
Prove to us
that he's not involved.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.916

a hell of a job.

you about compliments?

to Sergeant Voight,

16:44.177 --> 16:47.745

just own it.
