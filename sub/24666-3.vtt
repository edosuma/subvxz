the icy waters
off Newfoundland's coast

03:52.301 --> 03:56.063
overflowed with a seemingly
endless bounty of cod.

Fishermen from all over...

03:58.203 --> 04:01.586
As far away as England,
Portugal, and Spain...

04:01.620 --> 04:04.382
Came here
to pull them from the sea.

04:04.416 --> 04:06.418
They built entire food cultures

04:06.453 --> 04:08.765
around the delicate,
white-fleshed fish.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.942
And for most of its history,
cod defined the culture here.

04:12.976 --> 04:15.358
Cod was king.

04:17.878 --> 04:21.571
Ottawa is about to announce
a moratorium on northern cod.

04:21.606 --> 04:24.402
Small independents,
big company trawlers,

04:24.436 --> 04:26.196
all will have to pull their nets

04:26.231 --> 04:27.853
and dock their boats.

04:27.888 --> 04:32.030
But in 1992,
after years of overfishing,

04:32.064 --> 04:34.964
the Canadian government
shut the industry down.

04:34.998 --> 04:36.966
Six generations down the line,
passed down,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.589
and he's done nothing but...

04:39.624 --> 04:41.591
The moratorium wiped out

04:41.626 --> 04:43.938
the main source of income
for the province

04:43.973 --> 04:45.423
and ended a way of life.

04:45.457 --> 04:47.287
And though
it's been loosened some,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.979
the moratorium
is still in effect today.

of the people in '92?

your number one industry.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.365
No one could fish.

04:56.399 --> 04:57.883
- Culture...
- Nothing, zero.

04:57.918 --> 05:00.438
It went from going out
to jig a fish with your family

05:00.472 --> 05:01.439
or whenever you wanted

05:01.473 --> 05:03.061
to absolutely nothing.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.374

and soul out of people.

05:07.479 --> 05:09.964
Tilapia?

05:09.999 --> 05:11.725
Can I ask this, though?

05:11.759 --> 05:14.348
Was it warranted,
the closing down of the fishery?

05:14.383 --> 05:16.005
- Yeah.
- It was.

05:16.039 --> 05:18.041
Thing was, I mean, a lot of
the in-shore small guys

05:18.076 --> 05:19.457
were talking about it for years,

05:19.491 --> 05:20.830
talking about,
"We can't keep this up."

05:20.837 --> 05:22.349
Like, the factory trawlers
and the fisheries

05:22.356 --> 05:23.737
were just getting bigger
and bigger,

05:23.771 --> 05:27.672

a factory trawler

05:27.706 --> 05:30.088

- Yeah.

07:16.677 --> 07:18.748
♪

07:18.783 --> 07:20.992
We live in this fish culture.

07:21.026 --> 07:22.821
It's been fishing here
for hundreds of years.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.859
And the fish was always
not accessible to people here.

07:25.893 --> 07:27.509
It was something
that was always for export.

07:27.516 --> 07:29.103

07:29.138 --> 07:33.004
And so the fishery
is changing a little bit.

07:33.038 --> 07:35.869
I think as well, it was always
just a single-species fishery,

07:35.903 --> 07:37.767

07:37.802 --> 07:39.597
- By necessity.
- Yeah, absolutely.

07:53.542 --> 07:56.372
of traditional culture.

07:56.406 --> 08:00.341

08:00.376 --> 08:06.037
the way that... I'm going to try
to pronounce it correctly...

08:06.071 --> 08:07.348
Newfendlers...

08:07.383 --> 08:08.522
Newfoundlanders.

08:08.557 --> 08:11.525
Newfoundlanders see themselves?

08:11.560 --> 08:13.389
I mean, something seems
to be happening here

08:13.423 --> 08:20.810
as far as people here beginning
to value their own products,

08:20.845 --> 08:22.329
their own traditional food ways.

08:22.363 --> 08:24.055
Yeah.

08:24.089 --> 08:25.401
That's a big change,

08:25.435 --> 08:27.817
and it's something that
Jeremy Charles, for instance,

08:27.852 --> 08:29.578
has been doing
very, very, very successfully.

08:29.612 --> 08:31.165
How important is that?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.754
I think the one thing
that has kept people here

08:33.789 --> 08:35.515
in the wake
of the fisheries collapse...

08:35.549 --> 08:38.207
Like the fish moratorium
in 1992,

08:38.241 --> 08:39.519
so many people left.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.244
And what really
has kept people here

08:41.279 --> 08:42.763
is that sense of tradition.

08:42.798 --> 08:44.454
I think sometimes
there's this idea

08:44.489 --> 08:46.836
that tradition is static,
and that isn't necessarily true.

08:46.871 --> 08:48.037
Tradition is always
kind of changing

08:48.044 --> 08:50.012
in response to the environment.

08:50.046 --> 08:52.248
And people choose the things
that they're passionate about,

08:52.255 --> 08:54.119
and they find a way
to make that work.

08:54.154 --> 08:56.570
And I think Newfoundlanders
have always had that tradition

08:56.605 --> 08:59.021
of making do
and making things work

08:59.055 --> 09:00.678
in the situation where they are.

How Canadian is Newfoundland?

09:24.011 --> 09:26.635
You know, we have this
kind of complex relationship

09:26.669 --> 09:28.775
here in Newfoundland
with the rest of Canada.

09:28.809 --> 09:32.882
You know, we're a very old
British colony here,

09:32.917 --> 09:35.402
but we've only really been
part of Canada since 1949.

09:35.436 --> 09:38.578
And I think for a long time,
on the mainland of Canada,

09:38.612 --> 09:41.960
there was kind of this
stereotype of Newfoundlanders

09:41.995 --> 09:44.342
as being, you know,
poor and uneducated,

09:44.376 --> 09:46.793
kind of that goofy Newfy
stereotype kind of stuff

09:46.827 --> 09:48.070
that happened.

09:48.104 --> 09:50.624
And over the past 10, 20 years,

09:50.659 --> 09:52.143
there's been a real shift

09:52.177 --> 09:55.180
in how the rest of Canada
perceives Newfoundland

09:55.215 --> 09:56.630
but I think also

09:56.665 --> 09:58.736
as how Newfoundlanders
perceive themselves.

09:58.770 --> 10:00.282
And people, I think,
are starting to say,

10:00.289 --> 10:02.774

big staple

24:21.529 --> 24:22.944
It's the reason why

24:22.978 --> 24:24.704
the restaurant's
pretty much open, you know?

24:24.739 --> 24:26.319
Nowhere else in the country

Jeremy Charles, in my opinion,

24:36.198 --> 24:39.685
honestly, I would say
easily top chef in Canada,

24:39.719 --> 24:41.203
most likely, you know?

24:41.238 --> 24:46.623
As a model of bravery,
determination, courage, pride.

24:46.657 --> 24:48.694
And not a false note.

24:48.728 --> 24:53.008
We've not had anything
that's not from this island.

24:54.182 --> 24:56.736
What we got here
is the cod sound.

24:56.771 --> 24:59.152
It's the swim bladder
of the codfish.

24:59.187 --> 25:01.154
Just goes right up the middle
of the fish.

25:01.189 --> 25:03.985
We've been toying around
with this for a long time.

25:04.019 --> 25:07.195
This is almost like
boot leather, you know?

25:07.229 --> 25:08.403
It's really, really tough.

25:08.437 --> 25:10.681
So we'll salt it overnight.

25:10.716 --> 25:14.098
Then we'll soak it,
and then we'll dehydrate it.

25:14.133 --> 25:16.238
And this is the part
of you're left with.

25:16.273 --> 25:19.897
It's almost like a chicharrón
type of texture, you know?

25:19.932 --> 25:21.416
But my grandmother,
she'd probably just

25:21.450 --> 25:23.107
render up pork fat scrunchions,

25:23.142 --> 25:25.903
and they just fry these off,
you know?

25:25.938 --> 25:31.012
So what we'll do then is,
we'll drop that in the oil.

25:31.046 --> 25:34.049
And it's gonna puff up,
become this beautiful chip.

25:41.988 --> 25:44.853
Charred whelk with [indistinct]

25:44.888 --> 25:47.097
And crispy cod sounds.

25:49.168 --> 25:53.586
What was this?
Sound, floating bladder.

25:53.621 --> 25:55.208
Bladder.
Yeah, I like that.

25:55.243 --> 25:56.451
Mmm, good.
Bladder.

Newfoundland staple,

Oh, it's good.
