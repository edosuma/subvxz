no adventure
can fill that Grand Canyon

09:59.207 --> 10:01.426
which resides
within your soul.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.081
That's why I'm never going
to challenge myself again.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.474
That's the spirit.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.041
CYBORG: Now,
you'll have to excuse me,

10:07.084 --> 10:10.087
my partner and I have
some business to attend to...

10:10.131 --> 10:12.046
-[FARTS]
-[BOTH SNICKER]

10:12.089 --> 10:15.745
Uh, yeah, you know,
things at the office
are so backed up... [FARTS]

10:15.789 --> 10:18.748
I had to bring
some work home with me.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.097
[BOTH LAUGHING]

10:20.141 --> 10:22.578
BOTH: Taking care of business.
