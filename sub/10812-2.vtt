00:02.877 --> 00:04.629
{\an8}- MY NAME IS NATHAN FIELDER,

00:04.713 --> 00:06.881
{\an8}AND I GRADUATED FROM ONE
OF CANADA'S TOP BUSINESS SCHOOLS

00:06.965 --> 00:08.800
{\an8}WITH REALLY GOOD GRADES.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.844
NOW, I'M USING MY KNOWLEDGE

00:11.094 --> 00:13.763
TO HELP STRUGGLING
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MAKE IT

00:13.847 --> 00:16.725
IN THIS COMPETITIVE WORLD.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.858
THIS...

00:24.941 --> 00:27.402
IS <i> NATHAN FOR YOU.</i>

00:27.485 --> 00:32.531
UNDERNEATH THIS MAN'S CLOTHES
IS A HUGE GIFT FROM GOD.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.701
CAN YOU GUESS
WHAT IT IS?

00:34.784 --> 00:37.746
THAT'S RIGHT.
HIS SANTA CLAUS BODY.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.789
JAMES BAILEY HAS BEEN
A PROFESSIONAL SANTA

00:39.873 --> 00:41.875
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.835
AND IF YOU LOOKED LIKE HIM,
YOU'D BE ONE TOO.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.422
{\an8}- I AM 6'4",
AND I DO WEIGH 350 POUNDS.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.715
- HOLY [bleep].
- YEAH, HOLY [bleep].

00:48.798 --> 00:50.884
- YEAH.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.844
- I MEAN, MY DOCTORS WOULD
LIKE ME TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.181
- SO IT'S THE TRADE-OFF
BETWEEN LIVING LONGER

00:56.264 --> 00:59.100
OR DYING AND GETTING
TO BE SANTA.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.186
IT'S LIKE, WHAT'S BETTER?
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.354
- WELL,
IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.815
- BUT FOR SOMEONE SO COMMITTED
TO BRINGING US JOY,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.525
IT'S A SHAME THAT,
FOR MOST OF THE YEAR,

01:07.609 --> 01:08.818
JAMES IS COMPLETELY
OUT OF WORK.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.945
- IN THE SUMMERTIME,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.823
SANTA CLAUS
BECOMES A HOMELESS PERSON.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.367
- BUT I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF I DIDN'T HAVE A SOLUTION.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.661
SO YOU KNOW
HOW THE BEST TIME TO BUY

01:18.745 --> 01:20.455
A WINTER COAT
IS IN THE SUMMER?

01:20.538 --> 01:21.623
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHEN ALL THE SALES ARE.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.666
- YES.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.002
- SO WHAT I'M THINKING
IS THAT SAME APPROACH...

01:26.085 --> 01:29.214
WITH SANTA.

01:29.297 --> 01:32.258
- I'M NOT SEEING
HOW THAT APPLIES TO SANTA CLAUS.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.135
- EVERY CHRISTMAS,
PEOPLE LINE UP IN MALLS

01:34.219 --> 01:36.179
TO GET THEIR PICTURES TAKEN
WITH SANTA.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.847
BUT WHAT IF YOU COULD DO IT
WHEN IT'S LESS CROWDED

01:37.931 --> 01:39.307
AND AT HALF THE COST?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.142
THE PLAN:

01:41.226 --> 01:45.230
DISCOUNT PHOTOS WITH SANTA
IN THE SUMMER.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.398
- YEAH,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.859
- I CAN SEE THE DOLLAR SIGNS
IN YOUR EYES.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.402
- [laughing]
- YEAH.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.654
- RIGHT.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.531
- FOR THIS TO WORK,

01:54.614 --> 01:56.282
WE NEEDED TO GET
A SHOPPING MALL ONBOARD,

01:56.366 --> 01:58.243
AND MALL MANAGER
SWEENEY MONTINOLA

01:58.326 --> 02:00.662
AT THE SOUTHBAY PAVILION
IN CARSON, CALIFORNIA,

02:00.745 --> 02:02.539
WAS HAPPY TO LET US
TRY OUT OUR CONCEPT.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.458
{\an8}- I THINK SANTA IN THE SUMMER
IS A FUN AND UNIQUE IDEA,

02:05.542 --> 02:08.044
{\an8}AND IT WILL BE GREAT
FOR SOUTHBAY PAVILION.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.878
- WITH A MALL ONBOARD,
IT WAS NOW TIME TO BUY

02:09.963 --> 02:12.006
THE SUPPLIES
FOR OUR CHRISTMAS VILLAGE.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.677
WHICH STUFF DO YOU RENT FOR
THE MOST, WHICH HOLIDAY?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.053
- CHRISTMAS.
- CHRISTMAS?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.055
- YES.
- OKAY.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.849
YOU REALLY SHOVED THIS AWAY
IN A CORNER, HUH?

02:20.932 --> 02:22.392
- YEP.
[laughing]

02:22.475 --> 02:24.477
- NO ONE LIKES THIS?
- YES.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.479
- BUT AFTER RENTING OUR PROPS,
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.439
THE MALL'S POLICY
REQUIRES A BACKGROUND CHECK

02:28.523 --> 02:30.233
ON ALL EMPLOYEES.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.693
BUT WHEN WE HAD ONE RUN
ON JAMES,

02:31.776 --> 02:33.736
SOMETHING ACTUALLY TURNED UP.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.989
SO I PAID HIM A VISIT
TO SEE WHAT THE STORY WAS.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.615
YOU HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.325
- WELL, YEAH.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.536
THE ONLY--
IT WAS A MISDEMEANOR,

02:41.619 --> 02:43.913
REALLY, FROM A DUI
MANY YEARS AGO.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.748
- OKAY.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.709
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I WAS HEARING,

02:47.792 --> 02:49.752
BUT THEN AGAIN,
FROM THE FIRST DAY I MET JAMES,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.588
I COULD TELL HE WAS DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER SANTAS.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.716
- THIS IS A SMITH &amp; WESSON
.500 MAGNUM.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.217
THIS IS A .45 CALIBER
SEMI-AUTOMATIC.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.011
.22 RIFLE.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.804
THE AK-47.
THIS IS A .300.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.056
LITTLE SHOTGUN
IN CASE YOU'RE INTO SHOTGUNS.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.018
THIS IS A .357 MAGNUM,
AND THAT ONE IS LOADED.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.103
- OKAY, WE CAN'T TAKE OUT
A LOADED GUN.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.022
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN

03:09.105 --> 03:11.733
ANY OTHER CRIMES
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.651
- NO,
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.236
- EVEN THOUGH JAMES
HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD

03:15.320 --> 03:17.113
AND A CLOSET FULL
OF GUNS,

03:17.196 --> 03:19.032
I COULD STILL TELL
HE WAS A GOOD GUY.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.825
BUT WHEN I WENT BACK
TO SOUTHBAY PAVILION,

03:20.909 --> 03:23.036
THEY DIDN'T SEE IT
THAT WAY.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.871
- I WOULDN'T ALLOW ANYONE
THAT HAS ANY KIND OF BACKGROUND

03:24.954 --> 03:26.873
TO BE THAT CLOSE TO KIDS.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.917
- I MEAN,
HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.001
I THINK
YOU'D REALLY LIKE HIM.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.670
- NO AND NO.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.380
- OKAY.
- DEFINITELY NO.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.132
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL JAMES

03:36.215 --> 03:37.967
THAT THE MALL
DIDN'T WANT HIM,

03:38.051 --> 03:39.969
BUT I PAID HIM A VISIT
TO BREAK THE NEWS.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.096
- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
IF WE COULD HAVE IT SET UP

03:42.180 --> 03:43.640
SO THAT WE COULD PRINT
THE PHOTOS RIGHT THERE.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.391
- RIGHT.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.268
- YOU KNOW,
SO WE DO THE DIGITAL.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.145
WE GET THE PICTURES TAKEN.
- SURE, SURE.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.396
- SO THAT MIGHT HELP
DRAW MORE PEOPLE IN.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.273
- RIGHT, SO I SPOKE

03:52.357 --> 03:53.983
TO THE DIRECTOR OF MARKETING
AT THE MALL.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.985
- OKAY.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.279
- AND...UH...

03:58.363 --> 04:01.783
- THEY'RE OKAY
WITH US DOING IT?

04:01.866 --> 04:04.953
YEAH?
GREAT.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.038
SO WE'RE GONNA
MAKE THIS HAPPEN THEN.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.915
THAT'S OUTSTANDING.
[laughter]

04:08.998 --> 04:10.708
- YEAH.
- GOOD.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.377
- YEAH.
- I JUST GOTTA SAY THANK YOU.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.753
REALLY.
I THINK THIS IS AWESOME.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.421
- JAMES SEEMED SO EXCITED,

04:15.505 --> 04:17.423
AND I JUST DIDN'T
HAVE THE HEART

04:17.507 --> 04:19.175
TO TELL HIM THAT HE
WASN'T WANTED BY THE MALL.

04:19.257 --> 04:22.595
SO MY ONLY GOAL
WAS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.764
MY HOPE WAS THAT,
IF WE GOT IN THERE EARLY,

04:24.847 --> 04:26.975
WE COULD DO ABOUT 1/2 HOUR'S
WORTH OF PHOTOS WITH JAMES

04:27.058 --> 04:30.019
BEFORE ANYONE REALIZED
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.230
SO ON THE MORNING
OF AUGUST 2ND,

04:32.313 --> 04:34.565
WE QUIETLY PULLED OUR TRUCK UP
BEHIND THE JCPENNEY.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.234
AND BEFORE UNLOADING
THE VILLAGE,

04:36.317 --> 04:38.861
I HAD A QUICK WORD
WITH JAMES.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.031
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IF I EVER SAY "ABORT,"

04:42.281 --> 04:44.826
WE SHOULD JUST WALK
TO THE EXIT IF YOU CAN.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.036
- ABORT.
- YEAH.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.914
- UM...

04:49.998 --> 04:51.791

08:24.879 --> 08:27.298
FOR MY TV SHOW
THAT MAY SEEM INNOCUOUS,

08:27.381 --> 08:29.133
BUT TO AN IMMATURE VANDAL,

08:29.217 --> 08:31.010
WOULD BE EXTREMELY TEMPTING
TO DEFACE.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.346
TO SEE WHICH ONE
WOULD WORK BEST,

08:33.429 --> 08:35.932
WE LEFT THE POSTERS UP
FOR A WEEK IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS

08:36.015 --> 08:37.475
AROUND THE CITY
OF LOS ANGELES.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.393
TO MY SURPRISE,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.479
THE "EVERY PENNY COUNTS" POSTER,

08:41.562 --> 08:43.356
"RISK EQUALS REWARD,"

08:43.438 --> 08:45.358
"TIE SHOES FOR SAFETY,"

08:45.441 --> 08:47.276
AND "BE FLEXIBLE"

08:47.360 --> 08:49.362
DIDN'T ATTRACT ANY GRAFFITI
AT ALL.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.656
HOWEVER, "DREAM BIG"

08:51.739 --> 08:55.326
AND "STAND UP
TO THE BIG GUYS" DID.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.120
I DECIDED TO GO
WITH "STAND UP TO THE BIG GUYS"

08:58.204 --> 09:00.957
SINCE THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY
FOR TWO [bleep]S

09:01.040 --> 09:04.335
AND PUT IT UP ON A WALL
NEAR A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.295
I LEFT A PEN
AND ADDED A STICKER

09:06.379 --> 09:07.964
THAT WOULD MAKE THE ACT
EVEN MORE IRRESISTIBLE

09:08.047 --> 09:10.299
TO AN IMMATURE SMART ALECK.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.134
WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS
IN PLACE,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.053
I WATCHED FROM A VAN
ACROSS THE STREET,

09:14.136 --> 09:16.722
READY TO POUNCE
AT ANY MOMENT.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.974
WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH THIS
IN A BIT.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.268
BUT FIRST...

09:20.351 --> 09:22.895
TERRY FOX HAS BEEN RUNNING
THIS PETTING ZOO

09:22.979 --> 09:24.730
IN OAK GLEN, CALIFORNIA
FOR YEARS.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.023
CAN I TOUCH THE FAT PIG?
- YES, YOU MAY.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.817
ABSOLUTELY.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.777
- BUT WITH SEVERAL
OTHER PETTING ZOOS

09:29.860 --> 09:31.988
LOCATED CLOSER TO THE MAJOR CITY
OF LOS ANGELES,

09:32.071 --> 09:34.365
TERRY NEEDS TO GIVE PEOPLE
A GOOD REASON TO VISIT HERS.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.200
AND THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.370
PEOPLE DON'T GO
TO SEAWORLD TO SEE A WHALE.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.289
THEY GO TO SEE SHAMU.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.457
- RIGHT.
- WHO'S YOUR SHAMU?

09:43.708 --> 09:48.462
- OUR SHAMU IS OUR PETTING FARM.
OUR PIGS, OUR GOATS.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.755
- SHAMU IS ONE ANIMAL.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.465
- RIGHT.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.384
SO IF I HAD ONE ANIMAL
TO PICK,

09:53.634 --> 09:56.804
UM, IT WOULD BE THE PIGS.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.639
- THE PIGS IS MULTIPLE...

09:58.723 --> 09:59.682
- MULTIPLE, YES.
- ANIMALS.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.350
- MM-HMM.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.518
- SO YOU DON'T--
- YOU JUST--

10:02.768 --> 10:04.645
- YOU DON'T HAVE A SHAMU.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.439
- WE JUST DON'T HAVE ONE SHAMU.
NO, WE DON'T.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.690
- MY MISSION WAS TO MAKE
OAK GLEN PETTING ZOO

10:07.773 --> 10:09.525
A DESTINATION.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.444
AND WHAT THEY NEEDED
WAS A STAR ANIMAL.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.487
THE PLAN:
TO CREATE A HERO PIG

10:13.571 --> 10:15.406
BY STAGING A VIRAL VIDEO

10:15.489 --> 10:17.658
IN WHICH HE RESCUES A BABY GOAT
FROM DROWNING.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.452
- OH, OKAY.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.746
- SO I THINK
IF YOU HAD A VIDEO LIKE THAT,

10:21.829 --> 10:24.123
PEOPLE WOULD COME FROM PLACES
AS FOREIGN AS JAPAN,

10:24.206 --> 10:25.791
AND EVEN MORE FOREIGN
LIKE CHINA,

10:25.875 --> 10:28.586
JUST TO SEE YOUR HERO PIG.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.005
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.423
- THE FIRST STEP
WAS PICKING OUR ANIMALS.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.051
VINCE WOULD BE OUR HERO PIG,

10:35.134 --> 10:36.802
AND GANGSTER THE GOAT
WOULD BE OUR VICTIM.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.721
THE ZOO HAD
A LARGE TROUT POND,

10:38.804 --> 10:41.265
SO THIS WOULD BE THE SETTING
FOR OUR RESCUE.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.100
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT VINCE
NEAR THE WATER,

10:43.184 --> 10:44.769
I REALIZED
HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE COWARD.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.562
[Vince squealing]
OKAY, OKAY!

10:46.645 --> 10:48.397
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

10:48.481 --> 10:50.358
- SO WE HIRED
SOME ANIMAL HANDLERS

10:50.441 --> 10:52.068
TO BRING IN
A PROFESSIONAL MOVIE PIG

10:52.151 --> 10:53.944
THAT LOOKED IDENTICAL
TO VINCE.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.363
THE QUESTION NOW WAS
HOW DO WE GET A PIG

10:55.446 --> 10:56.739
TO RESCUE A GOAT ON CAMERA?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.366
ANSWER?
YOU CAN'T.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.409
SO I DECIDED TO HAVE
TWO SCUBA DIVERS

11:00.493 --> 11:02.661
SECRETLY SUBMERGED
BENEATH THE ANIMALS

11:02.745 --> 11:04.622
GUIDING THE PIG
TOWARDS THE GOAT

11:04.705 --> 11:06.540
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE A REAL RESCUE.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.417
DURING
THE FIRST COUPLE ATTEMPTS,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.461
THE PIG KEPT SLIPPING
OUT OF THE DIVERS' HANDS.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.380
SO WE DECIDED TO BUILD
AN UNDERWATER TRACK

11:12.463 --> 11:14.382
OUT OF PVC TO GUIDE THE PIG

11:14.465 --> 11:16.175
LIKE A BOWLING BALL
GOING DOWN A BUMPER LANE.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.302
THIS WORKED A LOT BETTER,

11:18.386 --> 11:20.012
AND I WAS HOPEFUL IT WOULD
FOOL THE INTERNET AUDIENCE

11:20.096 --> 11:22.556
INTO BELIEVING
THIS VIDEO WAS REAL.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.975
BUT AS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE
INVOLVED BEGAN TO GROW,

11:25.059 --> 11:27.311
INCLUDING ANIMAL TRAINERS,
STUNTMEN,

11:27.395 --> 11:30.564
AND HUMANE SOCIETY REPS,
I STARTED TO GET WORRIED.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.400
AFTER ALL, WORD COULDN'T GET OUT
THAT THIS WAS FAKE

11:32.483 --> 11:33.859
OR IT WOULD BE
A DISASTROUS SCANDAL

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
FOR OAK GLEN.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.198
SO I ASKED EVERYONE ON SET TO
SIGN NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS

11:39.281 --> 11:40.783
STATING THAT THEY SWORE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE

11:40.866 --> 11:42.660
THE RESCUE WAS FAKE

11:42.743 --> 11:44.578
OR ELSE THEY WOULD FACE
THE DEATH PENALTY.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.372
EVEN THOUGH MY LAWYER SAID
THE DEATH PENALTY CLAUSE

11:46.455 --> 11:48.541
WAS NOT ENFORCEABLE,

11:48.624 --> 11:50.209
I STILL WANTED
TO LEAVE IT IN THERE

11:50.292 --> 11:52.086
SO PEOPLE KNEW
HOW SERIOUS I WAS.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.046
AFTER SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS,

11:54.130 --> 11:56.841
WE FINALLY GOT
THE RESCUE ON TAPE.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.926
[goat crying]

12:09.728 --> 12:11.480
WE HAD OUR VIDEO.
AND IT WAS GREAT.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.358
BUT NOW WE NEEDED
A CONVINCING BACKSTORY.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.569
IF THIS GOES VIRAL,
THE PRESS WILL WANNA KNOW--

12:16.652 --> 12:18.571
WHO FILMED THIS VIDEO?

12:18.654 --> 12:20.948
{\an8}I COULDN'T BE ME WITH
MY BACKGROUND IN TELEVISION.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.659
{\an8}PEOPLE WOULD SMELL A HOAX
FROM A MILE AWAY.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.245
BUT THERE WAS ONE PERSON
NO ONE WOULD EVER SUSPECT.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.538
SANTA CLAUS.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.708
- IN ORDER TO DISTANCE MYSELF

12:30.791 --> 12:32.960
FROM THE PIG RESCUING
GOAT VIDEO,

12:33.043 --> 12:34.503
I GOT JAMES TO AGREE TO SAY
THAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO SHOT IT.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.422
SO FOR BELIEVABILITY,

12:36.505 --> 12:38.174
I NEEDED TO RECORD AUDIO
OF JAMES

12:38.257 --> 12:39.550
TO MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE HE WAS THERE

12:39.633 --> 12:41.385
ON THE DAY IT WAS FILMED.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.636
- GOAT IN THE WATER!
GOAT IN THE WATER!

12:42.720 --> 12:44.180
- GOAT IN THE WATER!

12:44.263 --> 12:46.390
- YEAH.
GOAT IN THE WATER.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.267
- NOW, I NEEDED TO BE SURE
THAT TERRY WAS WITH THE PROGRAM.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.435
SO WHEN THE MEDIA
COMES A-KNOCKING...

12:49.518 --> 12:51.020
- MM-HMM.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.521
- HERE'S WHAT YOU SAY.
- OKAY.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.648
- VERBATIM.
- OKAY.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.650
- I SOMETIMES TAKE THE ANIMALS
OUT TO THE POND.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.653
THAT DAY, I LEFT TO GO GET
MY LIPSTICK FROM THE OFFICE.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.655
THAT'S WHEN THE GOAT
MUST'VE SLIPPED IN.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.866
I NEVER SAW THE RESCUE.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.994
HOWEVER, A GOOD SAMARITAN
SHOWED ME THE VIDEO.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.705
I NEVER GOT HIS NAME
OR HIS GENDER.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.248
NOW REPEAT.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.458
- GIMME A MINUTE.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.585
- I SOMETIMES...

13:14.668 --> 13:18.464
- I SOMETIMES TAKE THE ANIMALS
OUT TO THE POND.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.132
- HERE, I DID WRITE IT DOWN
FOR YOU.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.884
- THANK YOU.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.719
- WITH TERRY'S SCRIPT
TO MEMORIZE,

13:23.969 --> 13:25.554
THE HERO PIG STORY
WAS BECOMING MORE CONCRETE.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.640
- "WHEN THE GOAT SLIPPED IN."
OKAY.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.517
- BUT THEN I REALIZED
I HAD ONE MORE MOUTH TO SHUT.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.602
WHILE WE WERE FILMING
THE RESCUE,

13:31.685 --> 13:33.437
ONE OF THE SCUBA DIVERS,
ALEX,

13:33.521 --> 13:35.356
WAS TELLING ME
SOME PRETTY PERSONAL STUFF

13:35.439 --> 13:37.066
ABOUT ACTORS HE'S WORKED WITH
IN THE PAST.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.275
- JENNIFER ANISTON,
BEN STILLER.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.110
BEN'S PRETTY BOLD.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.029
HE HAD TO DO SOME KINDA
NUDE WATER STUFF

13:42.112 --> 13:44.114
OVER IN HAWAII...
FOR <i> ALONG CAME POLLY.</i>

13:44.198 --> 13:45.783
I DID THAT MOVIE
WITH HIM.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.701
- ALEX WAS CLEARLY
A LIABILITY,

13:47.993 --> 13:49.662
AND I COULDN'T HAVE HIM
SPILLING DETAILS ABOUT OUR VIDEO

13:49.745 --> 13:51.664
ON HIS NEXT JOB.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.791
SO I ASKED HIM TO MEET ME
AT THE PICO SUBWAY STATION

13:53.874 --> 13:55.751
TO HAVE A LITTLE
REMINDER CHAT.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.670
THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.
- WHAT'S UP?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.463
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- NO WORRIES. GOOD.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.048
- GOOD.
OH, YOU'RE A BIT TENSE.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.299
- SO, UH--
WELL, YOU KNOW--

14:02.383 --> 14:03.801
- STAND RIGHT HERE.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.094
SO HOW YOU BEEN?
- GOOD.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.263
- I JUST WANTED TO ASK.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.222
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT "PIG
RESCUES GOAT" VIDEO WE MADE?

14:08.305 --> 14:10.224
- YEAH.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.475
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING
TO ANYONE ABOUT THAT

14:11.559 --> 14:13.561
OR ANYTHING, HAVE YOU?

14:13.644 --> 14:15.229
- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO LIKE THREATEN ME.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.564
- WHAT?
- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE--

14:16.647 --> 14:18.774
- NO, NO!
NOT AT ALL!

14:19.024 --> 14:19.984
YOU'RE SHOULDERS WERE SORE.
THAT'S WHY I WAS DOING THAT.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.402
- COME ON.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.861
- JUST 'CAUSE I'D BE VERY...

14:22.945 --> 14:24.738
VERY UPSET...
- YEAH.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.532
- IF YOU TOLD SOMEONE
ABOUT--

14:26.615 --> 14:28.450
- COULD YOU--
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.702
OKAY, YES, I'M SORRY.
NO, I'M SORRY. YES.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.745
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.414
YEAH, BUT PLEASE
DON'T TELL ANYONE, OKAY?

14:33.497 --> 14:34.373
OKAY. THANK YOU.
- NO WORRIES.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.250
- OKAY.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.002
MY PARANOIA
WAS GETTING THE BEST OF ME.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.795
THE VIDEO HADN'T EVEN
BEEN UPLOADED,

14:39.878 --> 14:41.672
AND I WAS ALREADY
GETTING WORRIED

14:41.755 --> 14:43.382
ABOUT PEOPLE REVEALING
THE SECRET.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.384
PLUS,
WATCHING THE VIDEO AGAIN,

14:45.467 --> 14:46.635
I STARTED TO DOUBT
THAT THIS WOULD FOOL ANYONE.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.679
- GOAT IN THE WATER!

14:48.762 --> 14:49.638
- ALL I COULD DO AT THIS POINT
WAS UPLOAD THE VIDEO

14:49.888 --> 14:51.056
AND LET THE PUBLIC DECIDE.

14:51.140 --> 14:51.515
- GOAT IN THE WATER!

14:53.976 --> 14:55.728
- WHEN I WOKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING,

14:56.020 --> 14:57.730
I WAS ASTOUNDED TO SEE
THAT THE VIDEO HAD BEEN POSTED

14:57.813 --> 14:59.732
ON GAWKER, eBAUMSWORLD,

14:59.815 --> 15:01.400
AND A BODYBUILDING
MESSAGE BOARD.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.527
IT HAD OVER 3,000 VIEWS,

15:03.611 --> 15:06.030
AND THAT WAS WAY MORE
THAN I EVER EXPECTED.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.657
THEN I SAW IT WAS CLIMBING
THE CHARTS ON REDDIT.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.618
THEN I CHECKED THE VIEW COUNT
AN HOUR LATER.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.996
HOLY [bleep].

15:14.079 --> 15:16.040
- BY THE WAY, THIS MAY SOUND
LIKE A SEA RESCUE,

15:16.123 --> 15:17.374
BUT A GOAT--
A BABY GOAT--

15:17.458 --> 15:18.751
GETS STUCK IN WATER.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.211
{\an8}- THIS IS SOME PIG.
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.672
{\an8}A GOAT AT A PETTING ZOO
GOT STUCK IN A LAKE.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.634
{\an8}- THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
- THAT WAS COOL!

15:26.717 --> 15:28.636
{\an8}- HAVE NO FEAR,
THERE'S A PIG THERE.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.764
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T DO THIS
AT WARNER BROTHERS

15:31.847 --> 15:34.892
{\an8}AS A CARTOON
AND MAKE IT SEEM MORE REALISTIC.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.478
- WE'RE WAYWARD DUTY-BOUND
TO PASS THIS ON.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.772
IT'S THE LEADING
WEB VIDEO TODAY.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.775
WHILE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING
IF IT'S REAL,

15:42.858 --> 15:44.026
THIS WAS APPARENTLY SHOT
AT A PETTING ZOO.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.111
- GOAT IN THE WATER!

15:46.195 --> 15:47.821
- THAT'S A BABY GOAT
WHO GOT OUT INTO TOO DEEP WATER.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.365
BEGINS CRYING FOR HELP.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.866
ENTER THIS PIG.

15:50.949 --> 15:54.662
- [speaking native language]

15:54.745 --> 15:58.540
{\an8}- [singing]

15:58.624 --> 16:01.835
- IT SEEMED LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS TALKING ABOUT MY VIDEO.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.505
FOR A MOMENT, I FELT BAD
BECAUSE IT WASN'T REAL.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.340
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT THAT DIDN'T MATTER.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.801
- INTERSPECIES,
HE WENT AND HELPED--

16:08.884 --> 16:10.135
LEARN FROM IT, HUMANS.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.179
- IN THESE CYNICAL TIMES,

16:12.262 --> 16:14.264
PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE
FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN.

16:14.348 --> 16:19.061
{\an8}AND I GAVE PEOPLE A REMINDER
THAT IT'S OKAY JUST TO BELIEVE.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.979
- HOW DID THE PIG
FREE THE GOAT?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.815
- JUST KINDA GUIDED IT,
JUST PUSHED HIM.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.817
[laughter]

16:24.900 --> 16:26.819
- EVERY DAY WITH ELIZABETH
IS LIKE "HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?"

16:26.902 --> 16:29.697
- I ALWAYS KNEW THIS VIDEO
WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.907
AND THAT'S WHY,
IN THE END,

16:32.157 --> 16:33.826
I DECIDED NOT TO PUT THE NAME
OF THE PETTING ZOO ON IT.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.953
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO COME ACROSS LIKE AN AD,

16:36.036 --> 16:37.913
YOU KNOW, FOR THE PETTING ZOO.
- MM-HMM, RIGHT.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.832
- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A BIT TRANSPARENT.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.376
- BUT IF PEOPLE WOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT IT WAS OAK TREE VILLAGE--

16:42.459 --> 16:44.002
- BUT I MEAN,
YOU CAN'T BE SO SELFISH.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.338
- SELFISH?

16:46.422 --> 16:47.965
- WELL, I MEAN,
IF PEOPLE LOVE THE VIDEO,

16:48.048 --> 16:49.842
IT'S LIKE--

16:49.925 --> 16:51.760
CAN'T JUST BE
ALL ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.178
- BUT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT

16:53.262 --> 16:55.097
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME UP.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.724
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.767
- TERRY JUST DIDN'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND.

16:59.017 --> 17:02.521
BUT I DON'T LEAVE THOSE
THAT I HELP EMPTY-HANDED.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.856
THAT'S WHY I MADE HER
THIS SIGN.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.944
- AS MY STAKEOUT
FOR A YOUNG VANDAL CONTINUED,

17:09.028 --> 17:10.738
I WAS STARTING
TO GET FRUSTRATED.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.156
I'D BEEN MONITORING
THE POSTER FOR OVER FOUR HOURS,

17:13.240 --> 17:15.200
AND NO ONE HAD DEFACED IT.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.037
FOR A MOMENT, I THOUGHT
THIS WASN'T GOING TO WORK.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.580
BUT I WAS QUICKLY
PROVEN WRONG.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.540
OH, HE'S TAKING THE PEN.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.919
OH, MY GOD.

17:26.002 --> 17:30.048
HE'S ACTUALLY DOING IT.
ON CAMERA.

17:30.132 --> 17:30.966
LET'S GO!
LET'S GO!

17:33.343 --> 17:35.137
HEY, MAN.
- HEY.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.972
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
- IT'S GOING.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.807
- COOL,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.768
OH, THAT'S SO FUNNY.
YOU DREW A [bleep].

17:40.851 --> 17:42.728
- YEAH.
- YEAH, THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.438
WE'RE DOING A SHOW
ABOUT TEENS--COOL TEENS--

17:44.521 --> 17:46.648
CALLED "TEEN STREET."
- UH-HUH.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.484
- IS IT COOL IF WE ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE SHOW?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.319
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.570
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.
THAT'S MEGA FUNNY.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.906
THIS TEEN WAS NO GOOD,

17:53.989 --> 17:55.365
AND HIS PARENTS NEEDED TO KNOW
WHAT HE DID.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.992
SO TO EARN HIS TRUST,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.952
I TOLD HIM
WE WANTED TO MAKE

17:59.036 --> 18:01.038
AN ENTIRE "TEEN STREET" EPISODE
ABOUT HIM.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.831
SO WE SPENT THE REST
OF HIS AFTERNOON

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
SHOOTING SEGMENTS
FOR A FAKE SHOW.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.126
[beeping]

18:06.210 --> 18:07.920
{\an8}- WHAT UP!
I'M KYLE.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.797
{\an8}19 YEARS OLD.
AND THIS IS "TEEN STREET."

18:09.880 --> 18:11.965
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
[bleep] YOU.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.425
{\an8}[laughing] I DO WHATEVER
THE [bleep] I WANT,

18:13.509 --> 18:15.344
{\an8}AND I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.387
{\an8}THE THING I'M MOST PROUD OF
IS I MAKE [bleep]LOAD OF MONEY.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.430
{\an8}NO REGRETS.
[cheers and applause sounds]

18:18.514 --> 18:19.348
{\an8}- LISTEN TO THAT!

18:19.431 --> 18:21.517
{\an8}- BAM.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.019
{\an8}YEAH, I SKATED FOR SIX YEARS,
PLAYED THE DRUMS FOR SIX YEARS,

18:24.269 --> 18:26.021
{\an8}AND DID MUAY TAI
AND BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.940
YOU HAVE TO LOVE YOUR MOM.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.608
IF YOU DON'T,
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.734
{\an8}- THIS SHOW IS ABOUT
THE COOLEST TEENS IN TOWN.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.152
{\an8}both: "TEEN STREET," BITCHES!

18:36.573 --> 18:38.575
- FIRST TATTOO WHEN I WAS 13.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.536
THIS IS THE ONLY GIRL
THAT NEVER COMPLAINS TO ME.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.871
[moaning]
[laughing]

18:42.955 --> 18:43.956
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW I'M GONNA
SHOW YOU WHERE I LIVE.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.874
LET'S DO THIS.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.751
- FOR THE FINAL PART
OF THE SEGMENT,

18:47.835 --> 18:49.294
I SAID WE HAD TO DO A TOUR
OF HIS HOUSE.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.255
HE DIDN'T KNOW IT,

18:51.338 --> 18:53.423
BUT HE WAS LEADING ME
RIGHT TO HIS PARENTS,

18:53.507 --> 18:55.968
AND I WAS GOING TO TELL THEM
WHAT HE DID TO MY POSTER.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.928
- WHAT UP?
THIS IS MY PAD.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.763
THIS IS WHERE I SPEND MY TIME
MAKING TROUBLE.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.557
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU A TOUR
REAL QUICK.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.892
- SO WHO'S THIS LOVELY LADY?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.894
- THIS IS MY MOM SHERI.
- AWESOME, MAN.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.771
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- GUESS TEENS HAVE MOMS.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.982
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.526
ALL RIGHT, BUT WE NEED
TO STOP LAUGHING FOR A MOMENT,

19:12.609 --> 19:14.987
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SIT DOWN.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

19:15.070 --> 19:18.073
- OKAY.

19:18.156 --> 19:22.828
- HE'S DRAWN TWO PENISES
RIGHT THERE.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.538
AND YOU CAN SEE
I'M HOLDING THEM

19:24.621 --> 19:27.040
AS IF I'M MASTURBATING
THESE TWO MEN.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.001
- [laughs]
- YOUR S--YOU'RE LAUGHING.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.836
- I DON'T--
- WHAT DO YOU FIND--

19:30.919 --> 19:32.504
IS THAT FUNNY TO YOU?
- I--NO.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.922
THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
- THE PENISES?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.008
DO YOU LIKE THAT?
- NO.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.634
- BEING HELD LIKE THAT?
[laughter]

19:37.718 --> 19:38.969
IS THAT--
SO THIS IS--OKAY.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.054
SO THIS IS FUNNY TO YOU.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.931
TO MY SURPRISE, EVEN HIS MOM
WASN'T TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

19:43.015 --> 19:47.019
{\an8}LUCKILY, I HAD AN LAPD OFFICER
WITH ME TO SET HIM STRAIGHT.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.021
WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS A CRIME.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.772
IF SOMEONE SEES YOU
COMMIT THE CRIME,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.691
YOU CAN GET ARRESTED
AND GO TO JAIL.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.776
AND BELIEVE ME,
YOU DON'T WANNA GO TO JAIL.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.030
- WOULD DRAWING PENISES
GOING INTO SOMEONE'S HAND

19:58.113 --> 20:00.908
BE A SEGUE TO, YOU KNOW,
MURDER?

20:00.991 --> 20:02.784
- OF COURSE NOT.
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.952
- NEVER?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.704
- I'M NOT GONNA SAY NEVER.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.789
- SO MAY--YES.
SO THEN YES.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.083
- IF HE CHOKED ON IT, MAYBE.
- KYLE.

20:10.167 --> 20:14.338
SHOW RESPECT
AND APOLOGIZE.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.672
- IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GO.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.674
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,

20:17.758 --> 20:19.384
I DID ENJOY DRAWING PENISES
NEXT TO YOUR FACE,

20:19.468 --> 20:20.761
BUT I REALLY DO APOLOGIZE.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.763
- NO, I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.098
I DON'T ACCEPT AN APOLOGY
THAT STARTS LIKE THAT.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.975
- [clears throat]

20:27.059 --> 20:28.644
I APOLOGIZE FOR DRAWING
A PENIS NEXT TO YOUR FACE.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.688
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.108
- YOU'RE A GOOD KID.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

20:35.192 --> 20:39.154
AND TO BE HONEST,
I SEE SOME OF MYSELF IN YOU.

20:39.237 --> 20:43.825
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY
TO BECOME MORE LIKE ME

20:43.909 --> 20:45.535
AND LESS LIKE YOU.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.371
- NO, I DISAGREE.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.164
I THINK HE SHOULD MORE
LIKE HIMSELF--

20:49.414 --> 20:50.707
- WELL, HE SHOULDN'T BE
LIKE HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.834
SOMEONE WHO DRAWS PENISES.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.045
[overlapping comments]

21:00.217 --> 21:00.342
{\an8}[engine sound passing by]

21:02.844 --> 21:04.054
{\an8}- IT'S ALWAYS AMAZING TO SEE

21:04.137 --> 21:05.764
{\an8}ANIMALS HELPING EACH OTHER OUT.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.140
{\an8}- THAT GUY SAID--
DIDN'T HE SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

21:07.391 --> 21:08.934
{\an8}"GOAT IN THE WATER!
GOAT IN THE WATER!"

21:09.017 --> 21:10.018
{\an8}- YEAH.
- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.395
{\an8}AND THE PIG JUMPED IN.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.021
{\an8}- HE'S DEFINITELY
ON A MISSION.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.856
{\an8}HE'S DEFINITELY GOING
TO SAVE THE GOAT.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.941
{\an8}LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN
SAY THAT HE'S NOT.
