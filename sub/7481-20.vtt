Happy birthday, Flash!

00:21.915 --> 00:23.398
Thanks, guys.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.584
Ah, you ready
for private dance?

00:26.920 --> 00:28.870
Oh, my goodness.

00:28.872 --> 00:30.088
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, come on,

00:30.090 --> 00:32.445
birthday boy,
let's have some fun.

00:32.445 --> 00:33.229
Maybe later.

00:33.253 --> 00:35.253
How much is this
gonna set us all back?

00:35.712 --> 00:38.129
A hundred dollars
for ten minutes.

00:38.131 --> 00:40.248
See, that's a problem.
See, I didn't go to the ATM.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.850
All right, boys, let's pony up.
Um...

00:41.852 --> 00:44.853
Shut up.
$120, tip included.

00:44.855 --> 00:46.638
Guys... Really?

00:48.642 --> 00:50.884
You know,

00:50.886 --> 00:53.095
- you're all going to hell.
- Yeah, we are. Whoo!

Happy birthday, buddy.

Flash! Flash! Flash! Flash!

00:57.070 --> 01:00.724
So, what's your name?
Joshua.

01:00.726 --> 01:03.984
And why do your friends
call you "Flash"?

01:03.986 --> 01:06.012
Because...

01:06.014 --> 01:08.255
because my
last name's Gordon.

01:08.257 --> 01:09.868
Are you okay?

01:09.870 --> 01:13.127
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm good.

he's too drunk

01:41.256 --> 01:43.249
for dance.
What do you mean drunk?

01:44.297 --> 01:45.991
I remember
my first beer.

01:45.993 --> 01:47.984
No, that's impossible, he didn't
have anything to drink.

01:47.986 --> 01:50.195
Hey, call 911!

Sam, Callen?

03:18.737 --> 03:20.648

Uh, expenses as a detective.

Deeks, you're an employee.
Only independent contractors

Lieutenant Joshua Gordon,

04:06.368 --> 04:07.883
pilot for the Carrier Airborne

04:07.885 --> 04:10.076
Early Warning Squadron
out of Point Mugu.

04:10.078 --> 04:11.841
His birthday celebration

04:11.843 --> 04:14.149
took a fatal turn
in the VIP lounge

04:14.151 --> 04:15.849
of a bikini
bar in Oxnard.

04:15.851 --> 04:17.233
Mm, I can think

04:17.236 --> 04:18.882
of worse ways to go.

04:18.885 --> 04:22.116
- What?
-  Cocaine causes seizures.

04:22.118 --> 04:25.002
Uh, close. Also starts
with a "C," ends with an "E."

04:25.004 --> 04:26.651
Anyone? Anyone?
Ding, time's up.

04:26.653 --> 04:28.334
We were looking
for cyanide.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.804
Cyanide.
Someone poisoned him?

04:29.806 --> 04:31.089
Poisoned <i>them.</i>

04:31.091 --> 04:33.202
We also have
a dead dancer, and...

04:33.204 --> 04:35.146
Flight Officer Randall
Baker should be released

04:35.148 --> 04:36.566
from the hospital
sometime today.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.136
The
poisoning victims

04:38.138 --> 04:39.439
weren't drinking any alcohol;

04:39.440 --> 04:41.179
they were only drinking water.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.546
- Ah, the dangers of abstinence.
- How much cyanide

04:43.548 --> 04:45.659
- did they ingest?
- Not much.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.264
A quarter teaspoon
is deadly within minutes.

04:47.266 --> 04:49.681
And how did the cyanide
get in the water?

04:49.683 --> 04:53.298
Isn't that just the
$64,000 question?

04:53.300 --> 04:54.894
Mr. Beale?

04:54.896 --> 04:56.423
Jihadist groups

04:56.425 --> 04:58.550
are taking credit for the attack
on the Internet.

04:58.552 --> 05:01.210
"Those who poisoned
our land with war

05:01.212 --> 05:04.201
"shall be poisoned

05:04.203 --> 05:05.630
More attacks to come."

05:05.632 --> 05:07.725
Pull up everything

05:07.727 --> 05:09.917
Nah.

05:09.919 --> 05:12.461
This message is full
of spelling errors, bad grammar.

05:12.463 --> 05:15.236
I doubt if this is the work of an
Arabic speaker.

05:15.238 --> 05:16.981
Someone could be
pointing a finger,

05:16.983 --> 05:19.275
- trying to deflect the blame.
- Okay,

05:19.277 --> 05:21.769
well, where does one
get cyanide?

05:21.771 --> 05:23.398
Lethalpoisons.com.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.876
Let's track down potential
sources in the area.

05:24.878 --> 05:26.556
We'll take
the bikini bar.

05:26.558 --> 05:28.692
What? We will?
I don't like to see him beg.

05:28.694 --> 05:30.315
And plus, he would mope
all the way

05:30.317 --> 05:31.838
to Point Mugu
if we didn't.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.760
This is fantastic news,
but I don't beg.

05:33.762 --> 05:35.283
Oh, you beg.
I definitely don't mope.

05:35.285 --> 05:36.442
Mm.
'Cause you're the moper.

05:36.444 --> 05:38.678
You're, like, Mopey Dick.

05:44.392 --> 05:46.295
Well...
Hm.

05:46.297 --> 05:48.532
Feel free to take
the pole for a spin.

05:48.534 --> 05:50.237
Oh, touché.

05:50.239 --> 05:52.588
I'm, uh, seeing the bar.
Not a lot of bikinis.

05:52.590 --> 05:54.576
Ah, we interviewed the girls

05:54.578 --> 05:55.620
and sent them home.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.409
You sent the...
girls home?

05:57.411 --> 05:59.428
That's good.
Nice-nice work.

05:59.430 --> 06:01.780
We traced the cyanide
to this watercooler.

06:01.782 --> 06:03.248
You sure about that?
Verified

06:03.250 --> 06:05.085
by Hazmat.

06:05.086 --> 06:07.453
Tap water was pure.

06:07.455 --> 06:08.755
Here...

06:08.757 --> 06:13.043
we have a positive
Prussian Blue test.

06:13.045 --> 06:15.296
Shouldn't we
be wearing masks?

06:15.298 --> 06:18.766
Oh, no, no, no, that's...
hydrogen cyanide is a gas.

06:18.768 --> 06:20.351
This is potassium cyanide--

06:20.353 --> 06:22.436
it's a salt
that dissolves in water.

06:22.438 --> 06:24.389
Mm.

06:24.391 --> 06:26.608
Got no evidence
of tampering.

06:26.610 --> 06:28.728
Who changed the bottle?

06:28.730 --> 06:30.480
Janitor by the name
of Zaki Faheem.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.532
He could've put the cyanide in

06:32.534 --> 06:34.183
when he took off the cap.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.519
Doesn't look
like he did.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.853
Take a look.

06:40.593 --> 06:42.726
New water bottle
at 2235.

06:42.728 --> 06:46.631
Three poisonings
at 2247.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.166
Found the cap
in the trash

06:48.168 --> 06:50.219
with a pinhole in it.

06:50.221 --> 06:52.141
Looks like someone injected
poison in advance.

06:52.143 --> 06:54.263
What do we know
about the janitor?

06:54.265 --> 06:57.021
No hits on the DHS
terrorist database.

06:57.023 --> 06:58.242
Has anybody
talked to Faheem?

06:58.244 --> 07:00.029
Not at home;
cell phone's off.

07:00.031 --> 07:01.952
We've got a BOLO out.
What about friends,

07:01.953 --> 07:03.739
relatives in the area?
Checking right now.

07:03.741 --> 07:05.996
How many cameras you got
in the Champagne Room?

07:05.998 --> 07:08.085
Three.
You know, we're obviously

07:08.087 --> 07:10.393
gonna have to review
last night's footage.

07:11.446 --> 07:13.734
What? That is
a legitimate request.

07:13.736 --> 07:17.078
You'd watch
the tapes, right?

07:17.079 --> 07:18.138
Well, yeah...

07:18.140 --> 07:19.419
definitely.

07:19.421 --> 07:20.782
Definitely.

07:20.784 --> 07:22.433
We can watch
them together.

07:22.435 --> 07:24.235
Ew!
What?!

07:24.237 --> 07:26.307
Now who's moping?

07:26.309 --> 07:27.400
I'm not moping.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.287
You're just creeping me out.

07:29.289 --> 07:31.982
What are you talk... I'm trying
to keep America safe here.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.222
I'm catching bad guys.

07:34.224 --> 07:38.213
Uh, I remember Crawford
starting CPR on Flash,

07:38.215 --> 07:40.537
and then I woke up
in the hospital, sir.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.939
I understand that
last night at the bar

07:43.941 --> 07:45.370
you were drinking water?

07:45.372 --> 07:47.222
I'm not one for alcohol.

07:47.224 --> 07:49.631
And Lieutenant Gordon?

07:49.633 --> 07:50.961
Water as well, sir.

07:50.963 --> 07:54.160
I only had a few sips,
but he came from the gym

07:54.162 --> 07:55.777
and downed his pretty quickly.

07:55.778 --> 07:57.967
Within
the squadron,

07:57.969 --> 07:59.818
Lieutenant Gordon
have any conflicts?

07:59.820 --> 08:01.672
No, sir.

08:01.674 --> 08:03.734
Everyone had tremendous
respect for the man.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.594
He never got

08:04.595 --> 08:05.815
in any arguments?

08:05.817 --> 08:07.853
It wasn't in
his nature.

08:07.855 --> 08:11.046
I only ever heard him
raise his voice once.

08:11.048 --> 08:12.438
When was that?

08:12.440 --> 08:13.797
About a year ago.

08:13.799 --> 08:15.257
To counsel a...

08:15.259 --> 08:18.042
under-performing
aviation machinist mate.

08:18.044 --> 08:20.692
You got a name?
Fryman.

08:20.694 --> 08:21.881
But, uh, he's

08:21.883 --> 08:23.273
no longer in the service.

08:23.275 --> 08:25.174
He didn't get
along with anyone.

08:25.176 --> 08:28.962
He received an...
other-than-honorable discharge.

08:38.693 --> 08:40.912
It's a, uh... side effect

08:40.914 --> 08:44.841
from the lack of oxygen
to the brain.

08:44.843 --> 08:47.472
It should get
better in time.

08:49.627 --> 08:52.011
So, what are we doing down <i>here?</i>

08:52.013 --> 08:53.819
When I drank beer
in high school,

08:53.821 --> 08:55.546
where would I
leave the bottles?

08:55.548 --> 08:56.844
Not in <i>your</i> garbage can.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.373
And not in the
can next-door.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.936
At least three
houses down.

08:59.937 --> 09:01.875
Hence the long walk
from the Bikini Bar.

09:01.877 --> 09:03.109
Wait for it.

09:03.111 --> 09:05.229
You can't...
Deeks... Aw...

09:05.231 --> 09:07.301
That can't be safe.
Don't worry.

09:07.303 --> 09:09.520
If I get my, uh,
clothes dirty at work,

09:09.522 --> 09:11.855
I consider them
a uniform. Deductible.

09:11.857 --> 09:13.582
See, the secret

09:13.584 --> 09:16.673
is to write off anything
that vaguely relates to work,

09:16.675 --> 09:19.830
so say for instance
I were to rent a, uh,

09:19.832 --> 09:21.688
a heist movie,
then I would consider that

09:21.690 --> 09:24.280
professional research.
If I were to...

09:24.282 --> 09:25.786
Go to jail for tax fraud?

09:26.906 --> 09:28.745
Undercover assignment.

09:28.747 --> 09:31.640
If you smell like garbage,
you're taking the train home.

09:31.642 --> 09:33.713
Bam! See what
that is? Huh?

09:33.715 --> 09:35.687
That's probably gonna
be the murder weapon.

09:35.689 --> 09:40.119
Oh, wow, this place is a
treasure trove of good stuff.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.625
Think that's gonna fit?

09:41.627 --> 09:44.736
I know how much
you love leopard print.

09:44.738 --> 09:47.061
Yeah, how's it going, Kens?

09:47.063 --> 09:50.121
Uh, we found a syringe that
might test positive for cyanide.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.132
Nice. We just sent you
an address for Zaki Faheem's cousin.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.289
Zaki's car was parked out front.
Okay, we'll check it out.

09:55.291 --> 09:56.659
The good news is
the bad guys only had

09:56.684 --> 09:58.151
a small amount of poison.

09:58.152 --> 10:00.240
<i>Au contraire,</i>
<i>mon frère.</i>

10:00.242 --> 10:03.318
There is a 200-pound drum
of potassium cyanide missing

10:03.320 --> 10:06.044
from a silver plating factory
in Tujunga.

10:06.046 --> 10:07.369
200 pounds?

10:07.371 --> 10:09.047
Do the math.

10:09.049 --> 10:12.081
That's enough to send
800,000 souls to heaven.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.988
So this was
just the test.

10:15.994 --> 10:18.261
Big one is yet to come.

10:32.514 --> 10:33.348
All right, you guys,
here we go.

10:33.349 --> 10:34.403
Here's one for you.

10:34.405 --> 10:36.383
X plus five

10:36.385 --> 10:38.348
times X minus two.

10:38.350 --> 10:39.865
You sure we got
the right Fryman?

10:39.867 --> 10:41.014
Doesn't look like
a troublemaker.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.825
X squared plus
three X minus ten.

10:43.827 --> 10:45.230
Awesome, Alex.
Way to go.

10:45.232 --> 10:47.179
Want to show me
how you foiled the problem?

10:47.181 --> 10:49.255
God, I love algebra.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.554
It's logical, it's clean.

10:51.556 --> 10:53.199
That's right,
you used to be a mathlete.

10:53.201 --> 10:56.154
No, I wasn't a mathlete;
I was a Junior Math Olympian.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.958
It's big difference.
Uh-huh.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.306
You guys weren't allowed to count
on your fingers or something?

11:00.308 --> 11:01.935
Ready, everybody?
Bring it in.

11:01.937 --> 11:03.372
Winners never quit.

11:03.374 --> 11:04.251
And break!

11:04.253 --> 11:05.608
Yeah!

11:08.899 --> 11:11.325
Dominic Fryman?

11:11.327 --> 11:12.480
Uh, Dom.

11:12.482 --> 11:15.559
Agents Callen,
Hanna. NCIS.

11:15.561 --> 11:16.932
Uh, Dad, you coming?

11:16.934 --> 11:18.354
Uh, yeah.

11:18.356 --> 11:21.233
I'll meet you right there.
Just hit some ground balls

11:21.235 --> 11:23.493
and I'll be there
in a little bit.

11:23.495 --> 11:25.217
How can I help you guys?

11:25.219 --> 11:27.544
You heard about
Lieutenant Gordon?

11:27.546 --> 11:30.556
Yeah. That's, uh,
that's very sad news.

11:30.558 --> 11:32.079
You ever make it up to Oxnard?

11:32.081 --> 11:33.586
Seriously? It was
parent-teacher night.

11:33.588 --> 11:35.242
We heard you two
didn't get along.

11:35.244 --> 11:36.347
I didn't get along

11:36.349 --> 11:37.686
with the entire navy.

11:37.688 --> 11:39.862
I was deployed at sea, I was
away from my son for months.

11:39.864 --> 11:41.117
It's a calling.

11:41.119 --> 11:44.750
My son was my calling.
I wanted to be a real dad.

11:44.752 --> 11:47.394
Can you think of anybody

11:47.397 --> 11:49.151
who might want to harm
Lieutenant Gordon?

11:49.153 --> 11:53.359
You know,
funny thing about Gordon is

11:53.361 --> 11:55.861
no wife, no girlfriend,
never dated.

11:55.863 --> 11:59.443
A few of us wondered
if he was gay.

11:59.445 --> 12:01.574
"Don't ask, don't tell"
was repealed in 2010.

12:01.576 --> 12:03.128
He could have been open.

12:04.955 --> 12:07.490
Seems like the guy had
a lot of secrets.

12:12.645 --> 12:15.382
This is just far
too complex.

12:15.384 --> 12:17.867
I'll just use the E-Z form.

12:17.869 --> 12:19.151
It's like burning
your paycheck.

12:19.153 --> 12:21.890
Well, maybe I want to
do my part to pay down

12:21.892 --> 12:23.156
the federal deficit.

12:23.158 --> 12:24.290
So do I.
We should have a bake sale.

12:24.292 --> 12:27.264
I mean, I make
a mean snickerdoodle.

12:28.821 --> 12:33.077
Eric, the janitor's exiting
his cousin's house.

12:33.079 --> 12:35.325
Mr. Faheem?

12:35.327 --> 12:38.029
Federal agents.
Sir.

12:38.031 --> 12:40.650
No. I got the back.
Cover the street.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.686
No, no, don't.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.236
Really?

12:54.309 --> 12:56.114
Ah!

12:57.637 --> 13:01.390
Deeks?

13:03.121 --> 13:05.491
Faheem is down.
Where are you?

13:07.436 --> 13:08.471
What happened?

13:08.473 --> 13:12.966
Uh, I was attacked
by a hellhound.

13:12.968 --> 13:14.053
You shot a dog?

13:14.055 --> 13:15.173
No, I didn't shoot him.

13:15.175 --> 13:16.655
It was just a warning shot,

13:16.657 --> 13:18.993
but his pointy little ears
are gonna be ringing

13:18.995 --> 13:20.361
for a few hours.
And this?

13:20.363 --> 13:22.336
What this?
Oh, he just stole my shoe

13:22.338 --> 13:24.034
and ripped my pantaloons.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.679
Don't worry.
That's deductible.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.161
Up.

13:27.163 --> 13:29.714
As is the Band-Aids,

13:29.716 --> 13:31.180
antibiotic cream,
deductible.

13:31.182 --> 13:34.439
Tetanus shot,
deductible.

13:34.441 --> 13:35.725
The two-hour
Swedish massage

13:35.727 --> 13:39.298
because of my sore
muscles, deductible.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.035
So, if you're innocent,
why'd you run?

13:42.037 --> 13:45.000
I thought you were
going to hurt me.

13:45.002 --> 13:48.095
I have been the victim
of hate crimes... twice.

13:48.097 --> 13:49.724
We said we were federal agents.

13:49.726 --> 13:51.630
Does he look like
a federal agent?

13:51.632 --> 13:54.171
He's got a point there.

13:54.173 --> 13:58.033
Besides, in my country,
the police are not so friendly.

13:58.035 --> 14:01.241
You called in sick today.
You look pretty healthy to me.

14:01.243 --> 14:03.977
I heard about the man who died.

14:03.979 --> 14:05.119
They will blame me.

14:05.121 --> 14:07.317
The bouncers,
they are not so enlightened.

14:07.319 --> 14:09.386
I was afraid of...

14:09.388 --> 14:12.156
How do you say,
"vigilante justice"?

14:12.158 --> 14:15.023
You sound
like a pretty smart guy.

14:15.025 --> 14:17.255
I have a degree
in Comparative Literature.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.235
And you're working
at a strip club?

14:19.237 --> 14:20.775
I got to pay the bills.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.688
Two of the girls who dance there
are working on graduate degrees.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.718
God bless America.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.241
Look, I don't like
this job.

14:27.243 --> 14:28.545
I don't tell my family about it.

14:28.547 --> 14:29.973
You didn't tamper
with the water?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.136
No.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.608
You didn't help anyone else
gain access to the water jug?

14:32.610 --> 14:33.759
Absolutely not.

14:33.761 --> 14:35.418
We're gonna comb
through every text,

14:35.420 --> 14:37.653
every e-mail, everything.

14:37.655 --> 14:40.056
And if we find any link to terrorism,
you're gonna spend the rest

14:40.058 --> 14:41.716
of your life behind bars.
You understand that?

14:41.718 --> 14:43.239
I understand.

14:43.241 --> 14:46.539
Did any customers seem
odd to you? Suspicious?

14:46.541 --> 14:49.214
Only about 90% of them.
But there was

14:49.216 --> 14:52.125
this new guy with a beer belly.
He came two nights

14:52.127 --> 14:54.157
in a row
with a lot of questions.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.322
Wanted to know if there were
any job openings.

14:56.324 --> 15:00.048
You think you can I.D. him off
a security tape?

15:00.050 --> 15:02.722
I can try.

15:12.916 --> 15:15.442
You go through
a lot of cyanide?

15:15.444 --> 15:18.167
It's the standard solvent
for gold and silver plating.

15:18.169 --> 15:20.810
Last week we signed
for five barrels,

15:20.812 --> 15:22.544
and now there's only four.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.319
How does a 200-pound barrel
just walk away?

15:25.321 --> 15:27.252
Good question.

15:27.254 --> 15:30.110
Who has access to this elevator?

15:30.112 --> 15:32.686
Security opens for deliveries
and spent material pickup.

15:32.688 --> 15:35.924
We're combing through
the surveillance footage now.

15:37.741 --> 15:39.392
Is the powder loose inside?

15:39.394 --> 15:44.182
No. It's sealed in heavy plastic
in case the barrel gets damaged.

15:50.295 --> 15:51.747
Whoa.

15:51.749 --> 15:53.548
It-It shouldn't be like that.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.134
I brought the kit.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.138
That's negative
for cyanide.

16:15.864 --> 16:17.961
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

16:23.578 --> 16:25.030
It's ordinary
table salt.

16:25.032 --> 16:26.798
They probably all are.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.092
I've got two more containers
that are unsealed.

16:31.094 --> 16:33.174
Why take just one barrel?

16:33.176 --> 16:34.138
Maybe someone interrupted them

16:34.140 --> 16:35.661
when they were switching
them out.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.488
That's a thousand pounds
of cyanide.

16:37.490 --> 16:40.398
That's enough to kill
four million people.

16:43.496 --> 16:45.441
Status of the Bikini Bar?

16:45.443 --> 16:47.115
No fingerprints
on the syringe.

16:47.117 --> 16:49.822
The water jug storage area
is off-camera and hidden

16:49.824 --> 16:51.700
in an alcove.
What about Zaki Faheem's

16:51.702 --> 16:53.476
- electronic footprint?
- Uh, clean as a whistle.

16:53.478 --> 16:55.743
He hasn't even looked
at a porn site in three years.

16:55.745 --> 16:58.046
Wait, you can tell
that sort of thing?

16:58.048 --> 16:59.128
I'm just kidding.

16:59.130 --> 17:01.479
Lieutenant Gordon's
sexual orientation?

17:01.481 --> 17:03.917
He was practicing celibacy
as part of a Buddhist sect.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.387
All right,

17:05.390 --> 17:07.215
who would want to kill
a peace-loving Buddhist?

17:07.218 --> 17:08.839
A Hindu from Sri Lanka.

17:08.842 --> 17:10.684
Emperor of China.
A Bengal tiger.

17:10.685 --> 17:12.663
Am I the only person
coming up with ideas here?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.635
The factory's security
cameras gave us nothing.

17:14.637 --> 17:15.887
No one was seen

17:15.890 --> 17:17.404
tampering
with the barrels.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.146
The next step is
to trace the delivery chain

17:19.148 --> 17:20.613
from the cyanide factory
to the plating plant.

17:20.615 --> 17:21.998
Something had to have
happened along the way.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.300
Mr. Beale,

17:23.301 --> 17:26.281
would you turn on
the news channel?

17:26.282 --> 17:28.186
...San Fernando Valley,

17:28.189 --> 17:31.006
where a freak series of heart
attacks has kept paramedics

17:31.008 --> 17:33.156
on their toes
in this Chatsworth neighborhood.

17:33.158 --> 17:36.137
The 911 calls came within
five minutes of each other

17:36.139 --> 17:37.586
from three different homes.

17:37.588 --> 17:39.069
Cyanide?

17:39.071 --> 17:40.486
The heart is the first to go.
They could all

17:40.488 --> 17:42.196
be using the same
bottled water service.

17:42.198 --> 17:43.953
Well, let's hope so.

17:43.955 --> 17:46.194
Because if that's not the case,

17:46.196 --> 17:48.682
it's in the city's
drinking water.

18:03.428 --> 18:05.111
Cyanide was confirmed
as the cause of death

18:05.111 --> 18:06.978
in all three cases.
Only one house

18:06.979 --> 18:09.155
on the block was getting
bottled water delivery.

18:09.157 --> 18:11.255
Metropolitan Water District has
sensors throughout the system

18:11.257 --> 18:13.230
that can detect contaminants.
Well, they didn't

18:13.232 --> 18:15.843
- work very well last night.
- Well, they're not on every block.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.662
This was a local attack.
No other casualties

18:17.664 --> 18:19.919
means the cyanide diluted
in the system quickly.

18:19.921 --> 18:22.298
You can't go public
with a "do not drink" order.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.460
You'll have hospital gridlock
from everybody with a...

18:24.462 --> 18:26.948
headache, stomach pain,
dizziness.

18:26.950 --> 18:28.543
Hoarding of bottled water.
Fights at grocery stores.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.438
Widespread panic.

18:29.439 --> 18:31.786
That could be
the terrorist's goal.

18:31.788 --> 18:33.955
Eric, pull up any information

18:33.957 --> 18:36.873
on recent rentals or vacant
houses in the neighborhood.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.127
We'll keep working on the
cyanide delivery. Kensi, Deeks,

18:39.129 --> 18:41.011
check the water supply
in the Chatsworth neighborhood.

18:41.013 --> 18:43.348
Excuse me.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.117
Ms. Blye

18:46.119 --> 18:48.052
will stay above,

18:48.054 --> 18:51.839
and Mr. Deeks will go below.

18:51.841 --> 18:53.726
What's this?

18:54.627 --> 18:56.979
Wastewater Engineer?

18:56.981 --> 18:57.979
Sewer worker?

18:57.981 --> 18:59.348
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.133
But no, like,
open trenches, right?

19:01.135 --> 19:03.234
Like that crazy
scene from <i>Les Mis?</i>

19:03.236 --> 19:06.521
Au revoir, monsieur Deeks.

19:06.523 --> 19:08.906
Oh. <i>Mon</i> "due."

19:08.908 --> 19:10.241
Mon Dieu.

19:10.243 --> 19:11.909
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

19:15.782 --> 19:17.365
Hello, I'm Kelsey Blake,

19:17.367 --> 19:19.200
Water Ambassador
with the utility district.

19:19.202 --> 19:23.254
Hello there. How would you like
to cut your water bill by 50%?

19:23.256 --> 19:26.290
We're giving away complimentary
low flow showerheads with

19:26.292 --> 19:28.426
free installation today.
All I have to do

19:28.428 --> 19:30.511
is inspect your faucets
and plumbing,

19:30.513 --> 19:33.097
and I can offer you even more
money saving tips.

19:33.932 --> 19:35.632
Sounds good to me.

19:36.769 --> 19:39.303
How's it going up there?

19:39.305 --> 19:42.573
Nothing toxic but a moldy
shower curtain. How about you?

19:42.575 --> 19:45.977
Everything's shipshape,
but I keep hearing footsteps.

19:45.979 --> 19:48.646
Either there's
a really large rat

19:48.648 --> 19:51.782
or Javert is closing in.

19:51.784 --> 19:53.984
Hey, Eugene. I'm all done.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.021
Would you like a cup of tea?

19:57.023 --> 19:58.406
I would love

19:58.408 --> 20:00.191
a cup of tea, but I have
so much work to do.

20:00.193 --> 20:01.289
Thank you.

20:01.291 --> 20:03.352
Did you go next door?

20:03.354 --> 20:06.314
No, not yet.

20:06.316 --> 20:08.312
You probably shouldn't.

20:08.314 --> 20:10.026
Why not?

20:10.028 --> 20:12.638
They, uh...

20:12.640 --> 20:14.718
shoot movies there.

20:15.969 --> 20:17.964
Stag films.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.261
Oh.

20:20.263 --> 20:21.259
The pornos.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.791
No, I got it.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.954
I have even seen...

20:24.956 --> 20:26.418
little people.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.313
You know, dwarves.

20:30.114 --> 20:32.276
And that can't be good.

20:35.356 --> 20:37.519
One of the victims
in the Chatsworth poisoning

20:37.521 --> 20:40.131
was a retired Marine Corps
general who hadn't seen action

20:40.133 --> 20:42.178
since Desert
Storm in '91.

20:42.180 --> 20:44.176
That's a long time
to hold a grudge.

20:44.178 --> 20:45.590
Any of the others
have connections

20:45.592 --> 20:47.470
to the military?
No. It doesn't look

20:47.472 --> 20:49.554
like they were targeting
military personnel.

20:49.579 --> 20:50.283
Whoa.

20:50.284 --> 20:53.079
Text from the field. Kensi just

20:53.081 --> 20:56.125
stumbled upon
an adult film shoot.

20:56.127 --> 20:58.270
Makes sense. Chatsworth is the
epicenter of that industry.

20:58.272 --> 20:59.789
What?

20:59.815 --> 21:01.781
I had to research
it once for a case.

21:01.989 --> 21:03.770
It was... before you were here.
So we had a hit

21:03.772 --> 21:06.736
at a strip club
and a porn set.

21:06.738 --> 21:09.453
Well, if the Arabic threats
turn out to be a hoax,

21:09.455 --> 21:11.369
we could be dealing
with homegrown terrorists.

21:11.371 --> 21:15.069
Who don't like when people
take their clothes off?

21:15.071 --> 21:17.485
There are fundamentalist groups
who oppose indecency.

21:17.487 --> 21:19.318
Eric, see if any
of them

21:19.320 --> 21:21.033
have a history of violence.
No problem.

21:21.035 --> 21:23.734
Oh, I just got a hit on a vacant
house less than a block

21:23.736 --> 21:24.984
from the poisonings.

21:24.986 --> 21:26.766
Let 'em know.
Got it.

21:45.948 --> 21:48.646
Hello?

21:48.648 --> 21:51.065
Is anybody home?

21:51.067 --> 21:53.532
Is today the open house? Hello?

22:05.770 --> 22:08.203
Deeks...

22:08.205 --> 22:10.287
get up here.

22:11.272 --> 22:13.572
What'd you find?

22:13.574 --> 22:15.206
Possible lead
on our baddies.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.439
There's a
group called

22:16.441 --> 22:17.740
Designing a
New America.

22:17.742 --> 22:19.207
D.N.A.

22:19.209 --> 22:21.258
They want the death penalty
for violent felons,

22:21.260 --> 22:22.674
drug dealers and
child molesters.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.508
"In order to create
an ideal society

22:24.510 --> 22:26.109
that's safe for children."

22:26.111 --> 22:28.593
Wonder how they feel
about strippers?

22:28.595 --> 22:30.110
Well, they believe that for
America to be great again,

22:30.112 --> 22:31.495
we need to clean
up our streets

22:31.497 --> 22:34.496
and pour lots of
money into education.

22:34.498 --> 22:36.263
It's a reasonable request.

22:36.265 --> 22:37.996
Their Web site has a
list of upcoming protests

22:37.998 --> 22:39.747
at Federal buildings,
uh, political speeches,

22:39.749 --> 22:40.959
military funerals...

22:40.961 --> 22:42.286
Why military funerals?

22:42.288 --> 22:44.113
Because they want
defense spending

22:44.115 --> 22:46.138
redirected to education.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.258
Let Sam know.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.366
Have him call my cell phone.

22:53.625 --> 22:56.213
Well, it's not your typical
instant hot water rig.

22:56.215 --> 22:59.833
Looks like at least
a five-gallon reservoir.

22:59.835 --> 23:02.538
It's obviously some sort of
industrial pump.

23:02.540 --> 23:05.011
Yeah, well, if the pump can
generate more pressure

23:05.013 --> 23:06.887
than the outflow
of the faucet...

23:06.889 --> 23:08.298
Then they could pump
anything they want

23:08.300 --> 23:10.207
back into the
water supply.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.311
Huh.

23:18.758 --> 23:21.611
There's another
blue light special.

23:21.613 --> 23:23.619
Then that's
our cyanide.

23:27.937 --> 23:30.541
No more war, no more war...

23:30.543 --> 23:33.828
Books, not bombs.
Books, not bombs.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.617
Books, not bombs.
Books, not bombs.

23:36.619 --> 23:39.257
No more war,
no more war...

23:41.199 --> 23:42.626
Hey.

23:42.628 --> 23:43.904
Knock it off.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.713
Knock it off.
I said, knock it off!

23:45.715 --> 23:48.054
Show some respect
for a fallen warrior.

23:48.056 --> 23:49.381
His death was
unnecessary.

23:49.383 --> 23:51.917
He is a victim of
corporate profits

23:51.919 --> 23:53.499
by the military
industrial complex.

23:53.501 --> 23:55.115
Look...

23:55.117 --> 23:58.265
His parents will be driving
here soon. Come on, man.

23:58.267 --> 23:59.968
Can't we have this debate
another time, another place?

23:59.993 --> 24:00.903
How do you justify

24:00.904 --> 24:04.527
spending $1.5 trillion
on unwinnable wars, huh?

24:04.529 --> 24:06.603
Securing America's future.
America's future's

24:06.605 --> 24:09.293
in the toilet. Our kids
can't read and write.

24:09.295 --> 24:11.317
We rank 25th
in education

24:11.319 --> 24:13.461
when we spend $700 billion
a year on defense

24:13.463 --> 24:15.603
and only $19 billion
on our schools.

24:15.629 --> 24:16.015
Look,

24:16.016 --> 24:17.953
look, I'm gonna need
you to leave now, okay?

24:17.955 --> 24:19.843
Really? Well, you never
heard of a little something

24:19.845 --> 24:21.630
called freedom
of speech, huh?

24:21.632 --> 24:23.756
Didn't they teach you
that there at <i>West Point?</i>

24:23.759 --> 24:24.703
It's a Navy uniform.

24:24.728 --> 24:26.769
And get out of my face!
Get out of my face, pal!

24:27.791 --> 24:29.866
Look, you don't want to do this.
The voice

24:29.868 --> 24:32.418
of the people will not be silenced!
But I can sure

24:32.420 --> 24:35.022
as hell shut you up.
Oh, yeah, why don't you try?

24:44.162 --> 24:45.726
Take this fool away.

24:45.728 --> 24:47.156
He provoked and attacked me.

24:47.158 --> 24:49.949
He started it.
I have witnesses!

24:49.951 --> 24:51.608
Save it for the cops.
Yeah!

25:05.826 --> 25:07.098
You okay?

25:07.099 --> 25:08.339
Just a few scrapes.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.471
What'd the police say?

25:10.945 --> 25:13.071
What's it to you?

25:14.048 --> 25:17.057
I was impressed
by your conviction.

25:18.454 --> 25:20.051
But not enough
to get involved.

25:20.053 --> 25:22.766
There are other ways
to make your point.

25:22.768 --> 25:24.442
It's called a hand grenade.

25:24.444 --> 25:26.209
You want to get these
guys' attention,

25:26.211 --> 25:28.971
you got to give them a
taste of their own medicine.

25:28.973 --> 25:30.368
I'm Lawrence.

25:33.163 --> 25:35.053
Gary.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.690
It's one of the protestors,
Eric.

25:37.692 --> 25:39.087
Run him through facial rec.

25:39.089 --> 25:40.426
As we speak.

25:40.427 --> 25:43.407
I have a lot of friends
who share your views.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.786
Want to go meet
some of them?

25:46.927 --> 25:49.137
What... right now?

25:49.139 --> 25:51.816
Unless you got
someplace else to be.

25:56.507 --> 26:00.628
Okay, the Good Samaritan
is Lawrence De Vries.

26:00.630 --> 26:04.395
Card-carrying member of D.N.A.,
Designing a New America.

26:04.397 --> 26:05.551
Looks like Callen's

26:05.553 --> 26:07.109
their first-round draft pick.

26:13.057 --> 26:14.866
What the hell is this?

26:14.868 --> 26:17.076
It's until we know
you can be trusted.

26:17.078 --> 26:20.476
Yeah, no, thanks, pal.

26:20.478 --> 26:22.804
So you didn't mean
what you said?

26:23.609 --> 26:25.451
Talk is cheap.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.595
We're trying
to make a difference,

26:27.597 --> 26:29.794
and we have the resources
and conviction

26:29.796 --> 26:31.510
to do so.

26:31.512 --> 26:33.875
Do you?

26:40.091 --> 26:41.822
I'm gonna hang back, Eric.
Keep tracking.

26:41.824 --> 26:43.621
Okay, we're on it.

26:45.788 --> 26:47.787
Oh, check this out.

26:47.789 --> 26:50.985
Two days ago Kensi and Deeks'
Chatsworth cyanide house

26:50.987 --> 26:52.250
had a plumber visit.

26:52.252 --> 26:54.850
Equipment went in
and never came out.

26:54.852 --> 26:57.532
And the van was
from a rental yard.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.331
All right.
I'll text them the address.

26:59.333 --> 27:02.579
Paul, to the front desk.

27:02.581 --> 27:05.112
Paul,
to the front desk.

27:05.114 --> 27:06.161
How ya doing?

27:06.163 --> 27:07.994
Uh, a little help?

27:07.996 --> 27:10.243
Watch the car!

27:10.245 --> 27:12.159
Deep ball, center field.

27:12.161 --> 27:15.307
Oh, Mays on the warning track.
It's going, it's going...

27:15.309 --> 27:16.907
Ah-ha-hoo!

27:16.909 --> 27:19.239
Mays makes the catch,
Giants win the pennant.

27:19.241 --> 27:20.784
Who's Mays?

27:20.786 --> 27:22.161
Who's Mays? Ha...

27:22.163 --> 27:24.529
Just a kid I went
to middle school with.

27:24.531 --> 27:26.073
All right,
does your dad work here?

27:26.098 --> 27:26.866
No, my uncle.

27:26.867 --> 27:29.887
How ya doing?
Nice catch. Thanks.

27:29.889 --> 27:30.884
What do you folks need?

27:30.908 --> 27:33.434
Federal Agents. We
need to check on a rental

27:33.435 --> 27:35.464
from a few days ago.
Sure.

27:35.467 --> 27:37.497
This your, uh, plumber's van?
Uh, we don't

27:37.499 --> 27:39.060
- rent plumber's vans.
- License plate

27:39.062 --> 27:40.487
says you do.
We have cargo vans.

27:40.489 --> 27:43.174
Must have slapped
a mag sign on it.

27:43.176 --> 27:45.442
You got a contract handy?
Yeah,

27:45.444 --> 27:47.457
give me a minute.
Hey, you know,

27:47.459 --> 27:50.010
it, uh, might've
been a Mexican guy.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.420
Yeah...

27:53.422 --> 27:55.083
here ya go.

27:55.085 --> 27:57.138
Got a copy of the driver's license?
Uh, second page.

27:58.796 --> 28:01.315
Zack Perez.

28:02.576 --> 28:05.799
Aka Zaki Faheem, the janitor.

28:05.801 --> 28:09.802
Is he in
trouble?

28:14.860 --> 28:18.039
You can take
off your mask.

28:20.428 --> 28:22.239
This is your
secret clubhouse, huh?

28:22.241 --> 28:25.896
You know, when I was a kid we
had a clubhouse in the woods.

28:25.898 --> 28:28.580
Come home from school, go
out play with my friends

28:28.582 --> 28:30.046
until it was
time for dinner.

28:30.048 --> 28:32.353
Now everything's
a supervised playdate.

28:32.355 --> 28:33.834
Kids can't be kids.

28:33.836 --> 28:36.767
And who can blame the
parents, not with all the...

28:36.769 --> 28:39.567
molesters and abductors
and predators out there.

28:39.569 --> 28:42.665
Mh-hmm.
It's a different world.

28:42.667 --> 28:45.711
Bad guys used to be in prisons
and psychiatric hospitals.

28:45.713 --> 28:47.720
And now they're on the streets.

28:48.711 --> 28:51.839
Max, Gary.
Gary, Max.

28:55.597 --> 28:57.193
How ya doing?

28:57.195 --> 28:58.840
Heavy fire power.

28:58.842 --> 29:01.191
Until they decide to take away
our Second Amendment rights.

29:02.101 --> 29:05.003
Make yourself at home.

29:15.441 --> 29:18.479
I'll ring the bell,
you cover the back.

29:18.481 --> 29:20.624
I know that bark.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.279
You know, dogs
can sense fear.

29:22.281 --> 29:24.204
I thought you were
a dog whisperer.

29:24.206 --> 29:25.775
Uh-huh, he's calm,
yeah. You here that?

29:25.777 --> 29:27.294
That is a mocking bark.

29:27.296 --> 29:29.236
I think you're suffering
from "post-dogmatic" stress.

29:29.238 --> 29:31.229
Oh, it is on. It is on!

29:31.231 --> 29:33.256
Hang on, hang on.
What? What do you got?

29:33.258 --> 29:34.725
Go, Nell.

29:34.727 --> 29:36.599
You guys can get in the
car and come on home.

29:36.601 --> 29:38.321
Why, is Faheem is custody?

29:38.323 --> 29:40.753
No, he doesn't even
have a real driver's license.

29:40.755 --> 29:42.596
But we saw his fake one.

29:42.598 --> 29:45.326
Yeah, we're not entirely sure
he's responsible for that.

29:45.328 --> 29:47.470
We found traffic cam footage
of the plumber's van

29:47.472 --> 29:49.144
in Chatsworth on the day.

29:49.146 --> 29:50.569
Sending it
to you now.

29:53.953 --> 29:57.016
Our construction rental guy.

29:57.018 --> 29:58.842
Is now our evil

29:58.844 --> 30:00.567
construction rental guy.

30:00.569 --> 30:02.879
Call Sam. We're heading
back to the rental yard.

30:02.881 --> 30:04.419
All right, we're on it.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.681
Yeah?

30:40.683 --> 30:43.193
Uh-huh.

30:51.737 --> 30:53.411
What's the plan?

30:55.136 --> 30:57.480
Special Agent Callen.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.641
This is, uh,

30:59.643 --> 31:01.115
awkward.

31:01.117 --> 31:02.505
This place is gonna be crawling
with federal agents

31:02.507 --> 31:03.628
in a matter of minutes.

31:03.630 --> 31:05.218
We'll be long gone.

31:05.221 --> 31:08.032
And so will you.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.745
We know about the cyanide.
And after 1:00 a.m.,

31:10.747 --> 31:13.041
the whole world will know
about the cyanide.

31:13.043 --> 31:15.687
And the city will
be a better place for it.

31:15.689 --> 31:17.730
Because...

31:17.732 --> 31:20.008
I care about our future.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.198
I want our children
to be educated.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.221
To be the best
in the world.

31:24.223 --> 31:27.258
How do we keep our
kids safe and secure

31:27.260 --> 31:30.825
when the streets are filled
with felons, drug pushers...

31:30.827 --> 31:33.015
and sexual deviants?

31:33.017 --> 31:35.471
That's your plan?
Mass murder?

31:35.473 --> 31:37.827
Only because the
government failed us, right?

31:37.829 --> 31:40.415
When your car's dirty,
you wash it.

31:40.417 --> 31:43.435
When your pipes are clogged,
you snake out the crud,

31:43.437 --> 31:45.807
and you flush
away the filth.

31:45.809 --> 31:47.972
That's how we're going to
make America great again.

31:47.997 --> 31:48.878
Getting rid

31:48.879 --> 31:50.569
of a bunch of criminals
in Downtown Los Angeles

31:50.571 --> 31:52.228
is not going
to clean up all of America.

31:52.230 --> 31:55.181
It's a call to action,
and many will follow.

31:55.183 --> 31:56.740
It's a criminal act that's gonna
get you the death penalty.

31:56.742 --> 31:59.445
I'm not
really all that concerned

31:59.447 --> 32:01.237
about death, Agent Callen.

32:01.239 --> 32:03.426
But perhaps you
should be. So, we can

32:03.428 --> 32:06.412
either, uh...
shoot you...

32:19.820 --> 32:22.091
...or you can drink the cyanide.

32:22.093 --> 32:24.829
This is a much
cleaner way to go.

32:24.831 --> 32:28.230
Is this the kind of example you want
to set for your son?

32:28.232 --> 32:29.669
My son knows

32:29.671 --> 32:32.195
that I'm trying to make the
world a better place for <i>him.</i>

32:32.197 --> 32:34.656
Once I drink this, you're not
going to see him again.

32:34.658 --> 32:35.935
It's hard to be a good dad

32:35.937 --> 32:38.173
when you're behind bars
or dead.

32:38.175 --> 32:39.628
Let's agree to disagree.

32:59.820 --> 33:02.568
You know you're not getting away
with this, Fryman.

33:38.547 --> 33:40.514
<i>It should be right there</i>
<i>on your left.</i>

33:40.516 --> 33:42.958
I'm not seeing him.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.462
Are you sure about this, Eric?

33:44.464 --> 33:45.757
I'm positive.

33:45.759 --> 33:47.599
And Kensi and Deeks
are on their way back to you.

33:49.578 --> 33:51.144
Looks like it's closed.

33:51.146 --> 33:52.743
You're within ten feet
of Callen's cell.

33:52.744 --> 33:54.901
It hasn't moved in
the last half hour.

33:58.434 --> 33:59.744
Got his phone.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.079
Any sign of Callen?

34:02.081 --> 34:04.275
They ditched his phone
in the trash.

34:04.277 --> 34:05.901
This place is huge.

34:05.903 --> 34:07.175
There's no way to tell
whether he's still here

34:07.177 --> 34:08.550
or they moved him
somewhere else.

34:08.552 --> 34:09.891
Well, before the trash can

34:09.893 --> 34:11.367
his cell signal
was coming from

34:11.369 --> 34:13.464
what appears to be
a warehouse.

34:13.466 --> 34:15.592
Uh, 50 yards to the south.

34:16.701 --> 34:18.812
Okay, you two clear
these two buildings,

34:18.813 --> 34:21.177
I'll clear the warehouse.

35:20.569 --> 35:22.463
What the hell took you so long?

35:26.354 --> 35:28.114
You used the hydroxo-C?

35:28.116 --> 35:30.796
Worked like a charm.

35:34.152 --> 35:35.877
Ops is monitoring
all water sensors

35:35.879 --> 35:37.806
and access points to
underground utilities.

35:37.808 --> 35:40.187
And DWP is ready to cut off
the water supply

35:40.189 --> 35:41.746
at a moment's notice.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.088
We've got
local law enforcement

35:43.090 --> 35:44.680
and Kaleidoscope
looking for them.

35:44.682 --> 35:46.273
Eventually they're going
to have to show themselves.

35:49.193 --> 35:51.370
Callen, you sure you don't want
to guide us from Ops?

35:51.372 --> 35:53.484
I'm fine.
Yeah? 'Cause a couple hours ago,

35:53.486 --> 35:56.616
you could barely move.

35:56.618 --> 35:58.005
You want to arm wrestle?

35:58.007 --> 35:59.895
Fair enough.

35:59.897 --> 36:02.527
Okay, so I think
we've got something.

36:02.529 --> 36:04.368
I figure whatever
they're going to do

36:04.370 --> 36:05.999
it's going to be big
and require access

36:06.001 --> 36:07.485
to the city's water supply

36:07.487 --> 36:10.149
so I started looking
into recent repair work.

36:10.151 --> 36:12.765
Yesterday, there were pothole
repairs on Hill Street.

36:12.767 --> 36:14.510
Your tax dollars at work.

36:14.512 --> 36:15.851
They were working adjacent

36:15.853 --> 36:17.739
to the city's water main
access point,

36:17.741 --> 36:19.307
but the city
has no record

36:19.309 --> 36:21.486
of any authorized work
for that area.

36:21.488 --> 36:22.795
If they mocked up
a couple of trucks,

36:22.797 --> 36:24.087
set up some
barriers...

36:24.089 --> 36:26.461
They could have easily
snuck in the cyanide.

36:26.463 --> 36:27.815
Let's do this.

36:28.796 --> 36:30.048
I'm in position.

36:30.050 --> 36:31.504
Exit is covered.

36:32.553 --> 36:35.142
Copy that, Sam.
We're in.

37:13.961 --> 37:16.753
Federal agents!
Drop your weapon!

37:17.786 --> 37:19.257
Agent Callen?

37:19.259 --> 37:21.508
I'm back from the dead.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.741
Yeah, not for long.

37:23.743 --> 37:25.382
You're outnumbered.

37:25.384 --> 37:27.244
It's you last
chance, Fryman.

37:27.246 --> 37:30.289
You give yourself up, you
walk out of here alive.

37:30.291 --> 37:34.825
That's not ever, ever going
to happen.

37:40.919 --> 37:42.186
He's down.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.377
Took his own cyanide.

37:49.379 --> 37:50.613
Should we call 911?

37:50.615 --> 37:52.306
Sam has the antidote--
call him.

37:52.308 --> 37:53.846
It's almost 1:00.

37:53.848 --> 37:55.739
We got to find
that cyanide.

38:07.698 --> 38:09.205
Got something!

38:09.207 --> 38:10.645
Don't come any closer.

38:10.647 --> 38:13.107
Alex...

38:13.109 --> 38:14.530
do you have a gun?

38:14.532 --> 38:16.926
Did you kill my dad?

38:16.928 --> 38:19.271
No...

38:19.273 --> 38:22.151
he's on his way
to the E.R.,

38:22.153 --> 38:24.948
then he's going
to jail.

38:24.950 --> 38:26.641
It's over, Alex.

38:26.643 --> 38:29.471
At 1:00 a.m., I'm
pulling the valve.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.067
I promised to
do it right.

38:32.069 --> 38:34.010
You'll hurt a lot
of innocent people, Alex.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.835
You don't want to do that,
do you?

38:35.837 --> 38:37.967
Alex?

38:37.969 --> 38:39.901
Kids can't walk to school alone.

38:39.903 --> 38:42.884
And when they get there, they're
not even safe in the classroom.

38:42.886 --> 38:44.885
We need to fix America.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.835
Not like this.

38:47.837 --> 38:49.819
Drastic problems
require drastic solutions.

38:49.821 --> 38:52.654
So you're going to poison
the whole city?

38:52.656 --> 38:54.080
Just the bad people.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.507
The good ones
are home asleep.

38:55.509 --> 38:58.130
You know who's awake
right now, Alex?

38:58.132 --> 39:01.801
Cops and fireman.

39:01.803 --> 39:04.161
And doctors and nurses.

39:04.163 --> 39:05.571
And people that work
at office buildings

39:05.573 --> 39:07.030
sweeping and taking out
the trash.

39:07.032 --> 39:10.933
You remember when your dad
was away at sea?

39:10.935 --> 39:13.670
He was fighting an unjust war.

39:13.672 --> 39:15.505
You pull that lever,

39:15.507 --> 39:17.850
tomorrow morning

39:17.852 --> 39:21.095
hundreds of kids
are going to wake up

39:21.097 --> 39:23.308
and they're going to have
moms and dads

39:23.310 --> 39:26.292
that are never coming back.

39:26.294 --> 39:28.924
Is that what you want?

39:30.208 --> 39:32.372
You're smart...

39:32.374 --> 39:35.654
you're a good guy.

39:35.656 --> 39:39.036
And you're going to make
this world a better place,

39:39.038 --> 39:41.085
but not like this.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.164
Do the right thing, Alex.

39:59.576 --> 40:01.989
What's going to happen to me?

40:01.992 --> 40:04.822
We're going to work it out.

40:05.772 --> 40:08.986
Come on.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.181
Uh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

40:20.183 --> 40:22.096
I just could not
stand it anymore.

40:22.098 --> 40:23.513
So you invade my personal space?

40:23.515 --> 40:25.794
No, I didn't invade
your personal space.

40:25.796 --> 40:28.143
I was just cleaning
and organizing.

40:28.145 --> 40:30.177
And you'll be happy to know
that I found your W-2.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.425
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you.

40:32.427 --> 40:33.724
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

40:33.726 --> 40:36.422
Have you seen G?

40:36.424 --> 40:38.755
Uh, he had to get
a blood test.

40:38.757 --> 40:40.804
Martin A. Deeks?

40:40.806 --> 40:43.170
Yeah, Marty Deeks.
Who are you?

40:43.172 --> 40:44.585
You've been served.

40:44.587 --> 40:46.251
- What?
- What the hell?

40:46.253 --> 40:47.833
How'd you even get in here?

40:47.835 --> 40:49.050
I'm a federal employee

40:49.052 --> 40:50.665
with a high level
security clearance.

40:50.667 --> 40:53.780
You work for Granger?
No. The IRS.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.747
Mr. Deeks,
federal law allows us

40:57.749 --> 41:01.169
to examine the past seven years
of your tax returns.

41:01.171 --> 41:05.402
Your illegal deductions,
with interest and penalties,

41:05.404 --> 41:07.182
could cost you over
a hundred thousand dollars.

41:07.184 --> 41:09.891
A h-hundred thousand dollars?

41:09.893 --> 41:11.890
I suggest you bring
your accountant

41:11.892 --> 41:13.194
to your formal
audit hearing

41:13.196 --> 41:15.226
which is scheduled
for April 21.

41:15.228 --> 41:17.631
No, no. No, no.
See, you, uh,

41:17.633 --> 41:19.545
you actually screwed up
the date on-on this form,

41:19.547 --> 41:20.867
which means it's probably
totally invalid.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.068
See, if you look
right there,

41:23.070 --> 41:24.627
'cause this says April 1 on it,
not April 21.

41:24.629 --> 41:26.031
- So this is...
- Oh, no, that's right.

41:26.033 --> 41:28.436
It's April Fool's.

41:28.438 --> 41:30.892
Look at his face.

41:30.894 --> 41:32.722
You rat bastards.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.704
Don't look at us,
it wasn't our idea.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.543
Hetty?

41:44.323 --> 41:45.839
Oh, man.

41:45.841 --> 41:49.432
She even pulled Morgan
out of retirement.

41:49.434 --> 41:50.561
Sorry.

41:50.563 --> 41:52.332
Morgan.

41:52.334 --> 41:53.985
That was a great
party, man.

41:53.987 --> 41:56.329
I loved your cake.
Thanks.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.835
Morning, Alex.

42:06.837 --> 42:08.943
Didn't think you'd come.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.147
I said I would.

42:12.149 --> 42:14.677
Got a ball?

42:15.774 --> 42:19.112
Let's toss it.

42:21.136 --> 42:23.819
What did you have
for breakfast?

42:23.821 --> 42:25.445
Pancakes.

42:25.447 --> 42:27.793
Lucky.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.722
Pancakes?!

42:29.723 --> 42:31.532
Sheesh.

42:34.585 --> 42:37.653
How'd you sleep
last night?

42:38.694 --> 42:42.131
Okay, I guess.

42:42.133 --> 42:44.899
If you sleep well
the first night,

42:44.900 --> 42:46.944
it means you're in a good place.

42:48.051 --> 42:49.627
How do you know?

42:51.439 --> 42:53.986
I just do.
