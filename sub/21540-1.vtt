been on the market for one day

00:10.110 --> 00:11.711
and that we don't negotiate.

00:11.745 --> 00:15.248
I'm at a point where,
literally, the sky's the limit.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.983
<i>I'm getting married this year.</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:19.119
Will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:19.152 --> 00:22.622
<i>- And my business</i>
<i>is bigger than ever.</i>

00:22.655 --> 00:24.024
I used to think that,

00:24.057 --> 00:26.326
"If I could get
to $50 million a year in sales,

00:26.359 --> 00:28.261
<i>oh, my God,</i>
<i>I'd be set for life,"</i>

00:28.294 --> 00:31.097

I'm gonna leave it at that.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.352
But the photos look good?
- Yeah, they look great.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.454
- I've also added team members
in Los Angeles

00:54.487 --> 00:57.524
and opened the Serhant Team
in Miami and the Hamptons.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.759
<i>It's really exciting</i>
<i>and also kind of scary.</i>

00:59.793 --> 01:02.662
I've literally had
to figure it out as I go.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.698
I have a check
for $10,000 here

01:04.731 --> 01:06.499

01:06.533 --> 01:09.803

Do you want to know?
all: Yeah.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.179
I think if your last year
is not the biggest yet,

01:53.213 --> 01:55.248
then you're doing
something wrong.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.549
How are you, sir?
Nice to meet you.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.984
Pleasure, pleasure.
both: Mwah.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.552
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.521
<i>- Last year,</i>
<i>I sold $90 million</i>

02:01.554 --> 02:02.922
<i>worth of residential</i>
<i>real estate.</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:04.557
Lovely to meet you.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.059
But I don't let that define me.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.694
I will never let money
define me.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.663
<i>It's how much I've improved,</i>

<i>how much people</i>

02:12.899 --> 02:14.200
<i>believe in me now.</i>

02:17.237 --> 02:19.072
I'll take it.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.074
Last year I realized that
I couldn't do this on my own.

- Yes?

- Ricellys, Luis.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.211
- Hi.
both: Nice to meet you.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.546
- We got a new member
on our team.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.615
<i>And I needed a team</i>
<i>of very qualified agents</i>

02:28.648 --> 02:30.083
<i>that could help me handle</i>
<i>all the business</i>

02:30.083 --> 02:31.251
<i>that was coming to me.</i>

02:31.284 --> 02:33.420
Good morning, good morning.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.788
- Hi.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.091
- It turns out they were not...

02:38.091 --> 02:39.492
perfect for me,

02:39.526 --> 02:41.127
and then I end up
firing everybody,

02:41.161 --> 02:43.096
so we're back to one,
the only survivor--

02:43.096 --> 02:44.431
Ronita.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.633
- Maybe, like, you're
a little bit of a perfectionist,

02:46.666 --> 02:48.601
but you have to,
like, work with people.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.603
Off the bat,
you can't expect to be wowed.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.539
- Listen, maybe I don't know
what I'm trying to do,

02:52.572 --> 02:55.308
but you're the only one
that's ever going to last.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.944
I've been thinking
about it last night,

02:57.977 --> 03:00.747

- [laughs]

03:00.780 --> 03:02.615

I'm in love with you.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.084

- Yep, I'm still single.

03:06.419 --> 03:07.954
<i>I don't know what it is.</i>
<i>I'll tell you something--</i>

03:08.054 --> 03:10.557
I envision myself having a house
with kids that I can--

03:10.590 --> 03:12.392
you know,
my kids running around,

03:12.425 --> 03:15.729
but that is the thing
that I keep on pushing,

03:15.762 --> 03:17.063
and I don't know why.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.865
Are we gonna have a great year?
- Yeah.

03:18.898 --> 03:22.268
- I want this year to be
the biggest one so far, period,

03:22.302 --> 03:23.703
in all of the aspects.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.372

03:25.405 --> 03:26.840
- Ciao.
- Bye.

<i>- All right!</i>

Another day,
another morning.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.088
This past year has been
a roller coaster.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.090
This is gorgeous.
[snaps fingers]

03:44.124 --> 03:45.859
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>my business is booming.</i>

03:45.892 --> 03:47.260
Everybody wants my listings.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.962
I mean, I think it's gonna
be a bidding war.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.365
I did $1.1 billion
in sales the last year,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.200
and I have
an international best seller,

03:54.234 --> 03:55.602
<i>in my book.</i>

03:55.635 --> 03:58.138
<i>And personally, we found</i>
<i>our egg donor, Lynn.</i>

03:58.171 --> 04:00.273
You want
to make Milla with us?

04:00.306 --> 04:03.510
- Yeah.
- Milla!

04:03.543 --> 04:05.779
And the day before the transfer,
literally,

04:05.812 --> 04:07.614
Derek looked at me and said,

04:07.647 --> 04:09.683
"Let's just do twins.
Let's put in two."

04:09.716 --> 04:11.918
You've really been thinking
about this with twins.

04:11.951 --> 04:14.521
- We don't Milla
to be an only child.

04:14.554 --> 04:17.724
- We got the call
from our doctor--

04:17.757 --> 04:19.359
"Congratulations.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.262
You are pregnant."

04:22.295 --> 04:24.330
<i>[voice breaking]</i>
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

04:24.364 --> 04:26.700
We're actually finally
gonna have these babies.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.536
Will you stay home
with me today?

04:29.569 --> 04:31.438
- If it'll make you
feel better.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.707
- [crying]

04:33.740 --> 04:35.909
So, when we got the call...

04:35.942 --> 04:37.410
it was in the middle
of the night,

04:37.444 --> 04:40.914
and it was our doctor.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.149
He said that they're--

04:43.183 --> 04:47.354
the kids
are not there anymore.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.589
- It wasn't meant
to happen now.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.591
- They were--they were dead.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.460
- I mean, things
happen for a reason.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.695
We both actually believe that.

04:55.729 --> 04:59.165
- After that...

04:59.199 --> 05:02.869
everything changed.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.871
<i>I looked at New York.</i>
<i>I looked at these buildings.</i>

05:04.904 --> 05:07.440
I looked at the parks.
I looked at the people.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.176
I didn't feel anything.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.045
<i>Everything was so bright</i>

05:12.078 --> 05:14.114
<i>and so big and powerful</i>
<i>and happy,</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:17.550
and then it's not anymore.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.886
Sorry.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.822
<i>It's all I can say.</i>

05:22.856 --> 05:25.959
<i>* *</i>

05:26.059 --> 05:30.096
[exhales deeply]
I just got to take a break.

05:41.641 --> 05:45.912
- Yuriy, we're going
to 277 East 7th Street.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.982
<i>The East Village has probably</i>
<i>the most colorful history</i>

05:49.082 --> 05:51.551
<i>of any neighborhood</i>
<i>in New York.</i>

05:51.584 --> 05:53.319
<i>100 years ago,</i>
<i>the East Village was known</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:56.756
for its tenement buildings,
its murder, its crime.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.224
There were derelicts.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.460
I mean, it was really,
really, really messy.

06:00.493 --> 06:03.263
<i>Now East Village is fun,</i>
<i>and that's the best part.</i>

06:03.296 --> 06:06.032
Everyone likes a comeback story.
I love the East Village.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.702
It's like the Rocky
of Manhattan.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.237
Now, that said,
there's the East Village...

06:11.271 --> 06:12.238
Hello?

06:12.272 --> 06:13.640
- Hi. Come in.
- Hey.

06:13.673 --> 06:17.877
And then there's
the East, East, East Village.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.713
- Joe Eisner, nice to meet you.
- Joe, how are you?

06:19.746 --> 06:20.880
- Hi. Steve Ferguson.
- Hey.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.549
And there's a difference,

06:22.582 --> 06:24.384
in part because
of public transportation.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.320
There's no subway
in the East, East Village.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.422
Beautiful.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.557
<i>It's super bright.</i>

06:30.590 --> 06:32.592
- Well, we have
these floor-to-ceiling windows.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.228
- It actually extends the living
space out...

06:35.261 --> 06:36.830
- That's awesome.
- To the exterior.

06:36.863 --> 06:39.666
- The building is awesome
for the East Village.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.936
<i>It's not some big, ugly,</i>
<i>all-glass building.</i>

06:42.969 --> 06:45.672
<i>It blends in nicely</i>
<i>to the block on 7th Street.</i>

06:45.705 --> 06:48.375
<i>It's six units,</i>
<i>five of which are two-bedrooms,</i>

06:48.408 --> 06:50.343
<i>and it's really, really,</i>
<i>really nice</i>

06:50.377 --> 06:52.579
compared to what you typically
find over here.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.114
<i>If you go</i>
<i>to the East Village now,</i>

06:54.147 --> 06:56.950
<i>you're surrounded by buildings</i>
<i>that are still incredibly old,</i>

06:56.983 --> 06:59.152
but this is brand-new.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.220
I love the floor.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.621
I actually just did floors
like this

07:01.654 --> 07:02.622
in my apartment, so I approve.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.024
<i>There's stuff in this building</i>

07:04.024 --> 07:05.425
<i>that you can't get</i>
<i>in the East Village.</i>

07:05.458 --> 07:07.027
<i>- Very high-end LED fixtures.</i>

07:07.060 --> 07:09.396
<i>- Porcelanosa tiles.</i>
<i>- Bertazzoni.</i>

07:09.429 --> 07:10.930
<i>- I think</i>
<i>that's the fanciest stove</i>

07:11.031 --> 07:12.032
<i>I've ever seen</i>
<i>in the East Village.</i>

07:12.065 --> 07:13.533
<i>[both laugh]</i>
<i>- It might be.</i>

07:13.566 --> 07:15.035
<i>We didn't want to cut</i>
<i>any corners.</i>

07:15.035 --> 07:16.903
<i>- Part of it was</i>
<i>to entice people over here.</i>

07:16.936 --> 07:18.672
- Oh, beautiful.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.041
<i>The penthouses,</i>
<i>which are the top two floors,</i>

07:21.041 --> 07:23.076
each share half
of the roof deck,

07:23.109 --> 07:24.844
<i>and the views are insane.</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:26.413
<i>They're totally unobstructed.</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:28.815
<i>* *</i>

07:28.848 --> 07:30.617
This is great.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.652
What are you asking for
for this one?

07:32.686 --> 07:33.953
This is the top floor.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.289
- Yes, we're asking
for 2.15 million.

07:36.322 --> 07:39.292
<i>[tense music]</i>

07:39.325 --> 07:41.061
<i>* *</i>

07:41.061 --> 07:42.662
- The pricing is fine.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.399
That matches the high, high,
high comps for the neighborhood,

07:46.433 --> 07:50.136
but these guys did put the work
into it to justify these prices.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.371
So what's going on?

07:51.404 --> 07:54.808
- We hired some brokers
to represent us.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.910
They held
a brokers' open house.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.913
Maybe 20 people
showed up to it.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.682
- There are over
8.4 million people

08:02.716 --> 08:04.217
in New York City,

08:04.250 --> 08:06.686
and only 20 of them came
to this open house

08:06.720 --> 08:07.921
in a brand-new building.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.723
None of them are sold?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.624
- No.
- There's a mentality now.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.927
If it doesn't sell,
it's the market.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.161
- That's exactly
what we heard.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.463
- And that is
such bullsh**.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.664
- That's exactly
what we heard.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.065
- So I honestly can't think
of anything else

08:19.099 --> 08:21.034
that you would do different
for the price point

08:21.034 --> 08:22.135
and for the location.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.937
I think the biggest issue
that you have,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.839
and I see this time
and time again,

08:25.872 --> 08:28.708
is that there's
no identity.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.810
People get confused.
They say, "Where is that?"

08:30.844 --> 08:32.645
Is there a name
for the building?

08:32.679 --> 08:33.880
- It's just the address.
- That's the default.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.215
- 277 East 7th Street.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.883
- Yeah, so we're gonna give
the building a name,

08:36.916 --> 08:40.420
because 277 East 7th Street,
people don't know where it is.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.356
New buildings need a good name.
They need an image.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.692
They need a thing so that people
are talking about them.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.862
That helps them build buzz.
That gets people excited.

08:48.895 --> 08:53.800
The Ryan...Residences.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.536
No, I have to work on it.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.738
- I like all of those ideas.
I hear what you're saying...

08:58.772 --> 09:01.007
- Mm-hmm.
- But it's not enough.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.009
I think any broker
could do that.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.544
We need results.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.714
We have investors
breathing down our neck.

09:07.747 --> 09:12.018
They have a short fuse,
and we need to execute quickly.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.688
Seriously, we're gonna need
at least two apartments

09:14.721 --> 09:17.691
in contract that first month,
if not more.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.159
Can you do that?

09:22.328 --> 09:25.799
- Yes, and then 60 days,
the building is sold out,

09:25.832 --> 09:28.735
and then we move on
to the next one as a team.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.036
- All right, well...
- Bring it on.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.604
- We'd like to give it to you.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.739
- Good.
- Excellent.

09:32.772 --> 09:33.873
- Ready to sell the building?
- Yes.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.308
- We're ready
to move forward, yeah.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.744
<i>- I'm gonna do everything I can</i>

09:51.558 --> 09:53.226
- Wow.
This is the money.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.894
I think this apartment
could trade anywhere

09:54.928 --> 09:56.763
from 12 million
to 14 million.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.531
Do you--do you smell it?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.833
It's so pretty.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.036
<i>Westchester is</i>
<i>a really wealthy area,</i>

10:36.069 --> 10:38.972

all these little river towns,

10:39.005 --> 10:42.409
and then there's one town--
Tarrytown.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.512
<i>And this is sort of an enclave</i>
<i>with the biggest mansions.</i>

10:45.545 --> 10:47.814
The Morgans, Lehman,

10:47.847 --> 10:49.149

10:57.791 --> 10:58.892
<i>and then just drive in.</i>

10:58.925 --> 11:00.226
So it's not,
like, even a getaway.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.928
It's, like, people

11:13.073 --> 11:17.410
Okay, Mr. Sell is here.

<i>- In this town, 10 million--</i>
<i>it's a big, big price point.</i>

12:40.994 --> 12:42.896
For $2 million, you can get

a pretty substantial home
in Tarrytown,

12:45.765 --> 12:48.101

Yes!

12:58.945 --> 13:01.081
I have to say,
I'm incredibly impressed.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.183
The type of buyer
that's gonna buy here

13:03.216 --> 13:05.051

13:07.053 --> 13:08.788
a gated community
with a gatehouse,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.123
to grow their families.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.158
When we were pregnant,
we started thinking,

13:12.192 --> 13:13.893
<i>"Should we move</i>
<i>outside the city,</i>

13:13.927 --> 13:16.796

<i>We would probably considering</i>
<i>buying in Andy's development.</i>

13:19.733 --> 13:22.902
You have 22 more lots.
What is the total sellout?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.938
- Over 200 million.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.339
- I want to make
that commission.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.675
I'm gonna throw the biggest
party anyone's ever seen

13:28.708 --> 13:31.077
in some authentic place
in New York City,

13:31.077 --> 13:32.512
maybe tied to one
of these families--

13:32.545 --> 13:34.080
the Morgans,
the Astors, whatever.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.482
Let me get
back to you on that.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.083
- Why wouldn't you want to have
a big open house here?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.352
- Because it's
about education too.

13:39.386 --> 13:43.690
I mean, I didn't know
until I drove 32 minutes here.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.092
Think about it--I need to open
this project with a bang.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.193
It's very difficult for me

13:47.227 --> 13:48.995
to get 400 people
out to Tarrytown.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.097
<i>Manhattanites are--</i>
<i>I wouldn't say lazy,</i>

13:51.131 --> 13:52.198
<i>but they're very comfortable.</i>

13:52.232 --> 13:54.000
When I got
the most interested people,

13:54.100 --> 13:56.102
I will take them
on private showings later.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.506
This project deserves
the biggest outreach.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.341
Actually, you know,
when I think about it,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.376
I'm perfect
for this project.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.112
Thank you for inviting me
and giving it to me.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.582
- Um, I...

14:09.616 --> 14:12.585
We're not interested
in giving the whole listing.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.056
We're only interested
in giving out this house.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.390
- Excuse me?

14:17.424 --> 14:20.160
- We're only interested
in a test-drive right now.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.963
- Test-drive?
- Test-drive.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.232
- That's a little bit tacky,
honestly.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.334
You're doing yourself
a disservice

14:27.367 --> 14:28.668
by giving one house
to a broker.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.870
You need somebody
who's really invested heavily

14:30.904 --> 14:32.205
long term in your project.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.841
I'm not taking this project
unless I get all of it.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.078
No offense.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.512
- We just don't know

14:39.546 --> 14:41.648
whether you would really come
from the city,

14:41.681 --> 14:44.751
whether you would actually do
what you said.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.287
So we would really
only be interested

14:47.320 --> 14:49.489
in this one house.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.091
- I passed that point
in my career

14:51.091 --> 14:55.929
where I'm test-driven
by clients...

14:55.962 --> 14:58.098
but I want this project.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.532
I am gonna get this project.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.335
So, fine. I will sell
that one house for you,

15:02.369 --> 15:04.070
and then you are gonna shake
my hand right now

15:04.104 --> 15:05.405
that when I do,

15:05.438 --> 15:08.141
you're gonna give me
all the rest--the remaining 22.

15:08.174 --> 15:11.745
Otherwise,
I will walk out right now.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.150
- Deal.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.518
<i>- I'm very excited,</i>

15:18.551 --> 15:20.420

a new listing,

15:20.453 --> 15:21.955
I have one commission at stake,

15:22.055 --> 15:24.924
but now, this case,
I have 23 of them,

15:24.958 --> 15:27.627

<i>- He is bringing the kitchen</i>
<i>from Italy.</i>

17:09.129 --> 17:12.132
He has all-wood flooring
from Brazil.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.633
Very nice.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.702
<i>* *</i>

17:15.735 --> 17:17.737
- The great corner
master bedroom.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.073
- Wow.
This is the money.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.475
- You got 12-foot ceilings here.
- Wow. Look at this.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.210
<i>The master--oh.</i>

17:24.244 --> 17:26.379
Oh, what a beauty.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.814
There's a little bit
of character in it,

17:27.847 --> 17:30.216
because normally you have
a very perfect square room,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.318
which is sort of boring,
and everybody has that.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.787
This is actually
very spectacular.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.588
<i>Perfecto.</i>

17:35.622 --> 17:37.057
So, um...

17:37.057 --> 17:39.159
- So I want to know what
you're thinking about pricing.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.960
- Listen, I think
it's a great apartment.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.595
I think this apartment
could trade anywhere

17:42.629 --> 17:44.564
from 12 million
to 14 million.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.400
- That's not happening.
I think we're wasting time.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.269
I have partners here involved.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.339
The partners are thinking
20 million.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.474
I'm a lot more realistic
than they are.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.076
I'm more, like...

17:56.109 --> 17:59.779
somewhere in the 17 million
to 18 million range.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.181
- What?

18:01.214 --> 18:03.750
<i>In today's market,</i>
<i>these trophy properties</i>

18:03.783 --> 18:05.585
are trading
for ridiculous prices,

18:05.618 --> 18:08.154
but what's really trading
in the building--

18:08.188 --> 18:10.490
it's around $2,200
per square foot.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.025
<i>He wants 4,000.</i>

18:12.025 --> 18:14.060
It's a big, big gap.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.730
- I mean, you take this
apartment across the street,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.665
you're looking
about $40 million.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.234
You're getting double the size
for half the value.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.036
- This building...

18:23.036 --> 18:27.040
it's great,
but it's 1986.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.608
It's--it's old.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.243
Elevators look 1986.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.045
<i>Hallways look 1986.</i>

18:32.078 --> 18:36.049
<i>People looking to spend</i>
<i>over $10 million on 57th Street</i>

18:36.082 --> 18:38.351
<i>want to get newer buildings.</i>

18:38.385 --> 18:39.819
<i>There is no way around it.</i>

18:39.853 --> 18:43.323
Nothing that was built in 1986
is worth $18 million today...

18:43.356 --> 18:44.924
except me.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.127
- The entire apartment's
all brand-new.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.430
We spent closer to $3 million,
maybe a little more,

18:50.463 --> 18:51.898
on renovating
this entire apartment.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.267
- I want to work with you
because I want this relationship

18:54.300 --> 18:56.936
to go beyond our friendship,
but at the same time,

18:56.970 --> 19:00.540
I want to make sure
that I deliver.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.776
I...

19:02.809 --> 19:04.310
will compromise
in the middle,

19:04.344 --> 19:07.213
and I will meet you
at 15 million.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.916
- 17 million.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.821
- Let's do it at 16 million...

19:14.854 --> 19:17.057
but that's it, please.

19:20.060 --> 19:21.795
- Make it happen, Luis.
- Yep.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.063
- After all these years.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.466
- Ha, excellent choice,
my friend, excellent choice.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.836
- But at one condition...

19:29.869 --> 19:31.037
it's not just only you.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.839
- What do you mean?

19:32.872 --> 19:35.809
- You're not
the only one getting this.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.177
<i>- Coming up...</i>

19:37.210 --> 19:38.511
- I'm just disappointed

19:38.545 --> 19:41.214
that you didn't have
the courtesy of calling me.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.383
Integrity is what makes you last
in this business.

19:49.289 --> 19:49.656
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

19:52.225 --> 19:54.894

19:54.928 --> 19:56.529
<i>- Make it happen, Luis.</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

19:56.563 --> 19:59.065
- But at one condition...

19:59.065 --> 20:00.533
it's not just only you.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.735
- What do you mean?

20:01.768 --> 20:04.504
- You're not
the only one getting this.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.672
- What do you mean?
Like--

20:05.705 --> 20:07.674
- I have to give it
to another firm also.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.609
- But that could be
a problem...

20:09.642 --> 20:12.145
because two firms mean
two different marketing angles.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.180
Two different marketing angles
means confusion

20:14.214 --> 20:15.382
as to what the brand is.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.549
Now, as a friend speaking,

20:16.583 --> 20:19.119
I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.487
<i>Am I not good enough?</i>

20:20.520 --> 20:23.289
I have produced.
I have had a track record.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.691
- Two firms
are better than one.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.127
We want
two different mind-sets.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.895
We want to make sure
this property

20:28.928 --> 20:30.663
gets the full exposure
it needs and deserves.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.465
- But I will give you
that full exposure.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.933
- We need one more firm.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.302
If that doesn't work for you,
Luis, then I'm sorry.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.637
I don't know
what to tell you.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.305
<i>- I don't want to say</i>
<i>it's insulting,</i>

20:39.339 --> 20:41.141
<i>but it sort of</i>
<i>feels insulting.</i>

20:41.174 --> 20:42.876
- Luis, you're a friend,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.844
but business
is business to me.

20:44.878 --> 20:49.916
<i>* *</i>

20:49.949 --> 20:51.818
- Okay, but I get
to pick the broker.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.586
I need to make sure
that I work with someone that--

20:53.620 --> 20:55.055
- You're killing me.
- No, listen, listen, listen.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.023
It's actually a good idea.
This is what you want.

20:57.057 --> 20:58.825
Now, you want two brokers
that can get along.

20:58.858 --> 21:03.063
I won't pick someone
that won't be the right fit.

21:03.063 --> 21:06.733
It's very fair.
- Done.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.069
- My man.
- Hopefully, once you sell this,

21:09.069 --> 21:11.071
you'll come over
and have a drink.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.772
We'll have a new--
third addition, God willing.

21:12.806 --> 21:15.675
- Another baby?
I'm behind.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.210
- When are you planning
on having a child?

21:17.243 --> 21:19.679
- This is my baby.

22:03.923 --> 22:08.428
Naming a building is super,
super stressful.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.631
I mean, for the people
that buy in this building,

22:11.664 --> 22:13.867
this is what their address
is gonna be,

22:13.900 --> 22:16.102

The Angel of 7th Street.

No one knows where
277 East 7th Street is.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.663
So East Village has to be
in the name.

22:43.697 --> 22:44.964
Awesome East Village.

22:44.998 --> 22:47.934

25:54.954 --> 25:56.589
- I take offense
to that whole "area" thing.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.757
I don't care about area.

- Okay, no, no, no.

I agree with you.

we have an understanding.

Good to see you.

- Good to see you.

26:23.316 --> 26:24.384
- So...

it doesn't matter what I do.

- There's a lot of people.

28:44.624 --> 28:46.159
There are people everywhere.

28:46.192 --> 28:50.196
There's a line out the door
to get into our brokers' open.

I had brought my developers

This is why you hire me.

29:01.641 --> 29:02.909
So there are six units.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.411
The building
is five two-bedrooms.

29:04.444 --> 29:05.779
And this is penthouse A.

29:05.812 --> 29:08.615
Two bed, two bathrooms--
I mean, built out to the nines.

29:08.648 --> 29:09.649
- Wow.

29:09.683 --> 29:11.284
- They spent, I think,
too much money.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.819
You didn't hear me say that.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.054
- I love it.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.655
- Do you have any questions
before I show you around?

29:15.689 --> 29:17.157
- Yeah, about
the neighborhood, mostly.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.191
- Sure.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.362
No, no, no, no, no.

29:22.395 --> 29:24.197
That's Lower East Side.
This is East Village.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.399
I get that people are unfamiliar
with the East Village,

29:26.433 --> 29:28.768
especially
the East, East Village,

29:28.802 --> 29:31.438
but I have come up
with solutions

29:31.471 --> 29:33.406
to ease that transition.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.808
This is the roof.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.876
So this is where the bike-share
program is going to be.

29:36.910 --> 29:38.678
We're gonna have all these bikes
that are gonna be free,

29:38.712 --> 29:40.180
so everyone who lives
in the building

29:40.213 --> 29:42.048
can grab a bike anytime and ride
around East Village.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.483
Those will be housed
on the roof,

29:43.516 --> 29:45.385
and then people can take them
over to the Astor Place train.

29:45.418 --> 29:46.820
- It's very nice, very nice.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.456
- I love it, you know?

29:49.489 --> 29:51.624
- Ryan, I want this Vespa.
- Really?

29:51.658 --> 29:53.059
- I want this Vespa.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.427

29:54.461 --> 29:55.795
All right, let's do this.

29:55.829 --> 29:57.063
All right, did everyone
put their card in?

29:57.063 --> 29:58.598
all: Yes.

not to pick an Elliman card.

- Okay?

30:33.967 --> 30:35.368
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, good. All right.

<i>absolutely nothing</i>

All right,
thank you, everybody.

If you didn't win something,
that means you're a loser,

32:04.457 --> 32:08.061
- Maybe around a 10 million
to 12 million range.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.297
- About 9.6 million.

32:11.331 --> 32:12.532
- Owner wants 16 million.

32:12.565 --> 32:13.633
- [clears throat]
What?

32:13.667 --> 32:15.335
- We're asking 16 million.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.637
- 4,000 a square foot?
- $4,000 a square foot.

32:17.671 --> 32:19.506
- And the building trades
at 2,258?

32:19.539 --> 32:22.208
- I understand that, but,
you know, there is the location.

32:22.242 --> 32:23.877
There is the fact
that we're on the top floor,

32:23.910 --> 32:25.078
high ceilings, the views.

32:25.078 --> 32:26.179
- It's a little steep.

- I'm not seeing that,
you know,<i>fuego.</i>

<i>Without that,</i>
<i>you're not gonna sell it,</i>

32:31.551 --> 32:32.686
especially at this price.

32:32.719 --> 32:34.087
Would you take this listing?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.956
- I would probably
take the listing.

32:36.990 --> 32:39.159
- I'd take it on,
understanding that, you know,

32:39.192 --> 32:42.662
there's gonna be
negotiation necessary.

32:42.696 --> 32:43.663
- Okay.

32:43.697 --> 32:45.131
Would you take this listing?

32:45.165 --> 32:47.567
- Not at 16 million.
- I understand.

I haven't found the person

One thing that I've learned

a beautiful Spanish boy.

I'm super busy

34:06.046 --> 34:09.149
Seven East Village,

34:09.182 --> 34:11.051
and preview
this crazy new listing

34:11.051 --> 34:13.420
that he has to see
if I have a buyer for it.

34:13.453 --> 34:15.488

Come.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.443

This is awesome.

34:36.476 --> 34:38.411

from time to time,

34:38.445 --> 34:40.380

34:58.798 --> 35:00.567

35:02.502 --> 35:05.138

35:05.171 --> 35:08.308
Cool, man. I think it's
a great listing, big number.

35:08.341 --> 35:10.643

This is a trophy apartment.

35:10.677 --> 35:12.278

Well, listen,
here's the deal.

35:22.155 --> 35:24.457
The reality
is that the seller--

35:24.491 --> 35:25.725
they want
more than one firm.

35:25.759 --> 35:28.128
I like the positivity
you have on this listing,

35:28.161 --> 35:30.230
so I'd like to give you
the opportunity

35:30.263 --> 35:34.267
to do this with me,
co-listing, 50/50.

35:36.102 --> 35:38.271
- No. No way.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.874
- What do you mean no?
- No, I can't sell this.

35:40.907 --> 35:43.810
It's way too expensive.
- Um...

35:43.843 --> 35:45.478

You are gonna sell it.

No?

Oh.

36:05.031 --> 36:06.232
Well, good for him.

36:06.266 --> 36:09.235

do an amazing job.

36:09.269 --> 36:10.537
I think we both
bring our forces,

36:10.570 --> 36:11.838
we can make this happen.

42:27.147 --> 42:29.916
You know, in life, what is
the ultimate goal about life?

42:29.949 --> 42:32.085
The ultimate goal in life

42:32.085 --> 42:33.920
is to have a huge, warm,

42:33.953 --> 42:37.090
beautiful kitchen
filled with family members,

42:37.090 --> 42:38.458

- Do you understand?

Love, a kitchen

be so lucky here.

get 10 million,

more receptive to the price

this first one
is always the most difficult.

50:56.956 --> 50:58.925
It is any new development.

The comps are not there yet.

she's very, very serious.

51:09.402 --> 51:11.071

1:00:15.515 --> 1:00:20.153
<i>Ryan signed a project owned</i>
<i>by our same seller</i>

1:00:20.186 --> 1:00:21.388
without even telling me,

1:00:21.421 --> 1:00:24.524
and I had to find out
by looking online.

1:00:24.557 --> 1:00:25.792
[doorbell rings]

1:00:25.825 --> 1:00:28.161
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1:00:28.194 --> 1:00:29.496
- Yo.
How are you?

1:00:29.529 --> 1:00:31.798
- Good to see you.

1:00:31.831 --> 1:00:33.033
- This looks good.

1:00:33.066 --> 1:00:36.036
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

1:00:36.069 --> 1:00:37.771

1:00:37.804 --> 1:00:40.006

very sexy.

1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:43.810

1:00:43.843 --> 1:00:46.446
<i>When you co-list, you have</i>
<i>to divide and conquer.</i>

1:00:46.479 --> 1:00:49.149
<i>Luis is great at staging,</i>

1:00:49.182 --> 1:00:50.917
<i>and since I was wrapping up</i>
<i>East Village,</i>

1:00:50.950 --> 1:00:54.154
<i>I knew that he would do</i>
<i>a good job with the staging,</i>

1:00:54.187 --> 1:00:55.622
and I was right.

1:00:55.655 --> 1:00:56.923
Look at it.
It's great.

1:00:56.956 --> 1:00:58.191
Okay, cool.

1:00:58.224 --> 1:01:01.594
I mean, you just wanted me
to see the furniture?

1:01:01.628 --> 1:01:03.396
I think it looks great.

1:01:03.430 --> 1:01:05.432
- Sit down for a second,
if you don't mind.

1:01:05.465 --> 1:01:06.633
- [groans]

1:01:06.666 --> 1:01:09.135
- So I have a concern.

1:01:09.169 --> 1:01:10.837
I found out yesterday

1:01:10.870 --> 1:01:13.206
that you just signed
another listing with Soly.

1:01:13.239 --> 1:01:14.507
- Uh-huh.

1:01:14.541 --> 1:01:16.109
- Listen, they hired you.

1:01:16.142 --> 1:01:18.645
They clearly thought you were
the better man, and that's okay.

1:01:18.678 --> 1:01:20.580
I'm just disappointed

1:01:20.613 --> 1:01:24.084
that you didn't have
the courtesy of calling me.

1:01:24.117 --> 1:01:26.619
- We did sign
the project in SoHo,

1:01:26.653 --> 1:01:30.323
and I had been talking to them
for a while about that.

1:01:30.357 --> 1:01:31.658
That has nothing
to do with me--

1:01:31.691 --> 1:01:32.992
any kind
of malicious intent,

1:01:33.093 --> 1:01:36.830
so that's why they had
kind of given it over to me,

1:01:36.863 --> 1:01:38.498
and that was it.
- Are you not seeing this?

1:01:38.531 --> 1:01:40.633
You're trying to justify.

1:01:40.667 --> 1:01:43.870
- I don't talk about projects
that I don't fully have yet.

1:01:43.903 --> 1:01:45.638
<i>I mean, how would</i>
<i>it have made me look?</i>

1:01:45.672 --> 1:01:47.841
<i>Knowing Luis,</i>
<i>Luis would pick up the phone.</i>

1:01:47.874 --> 1:01:49.109
<i>He'd call Soly and say,</i>

1:01:49.109 --> 1:01:50.276
<i>"Why are you giving Ryan</i>
<i>this project?</i>

1:01:50.310 --> 1:01:51.277
I'm your best friend,"

1:01:51.311 --> 1:01:52.412
And then
Soly would be mad at me.

1:01:52.445 --> 1:01:53.680
Why would I put myself
in that position?

1:01:53.713 --> 1:01:54.748
- The reason
I'm bringing this up

1:01:54.781 --> 1:01:56.116
is because we're
partners in this.

1:01:56.149 --> 1:01:58.184
If it was up to me, I would have
called you in a heartbeat.

1:01:58.218 --> 1:02:00.053
Listen, I don't expect
anybody to tell me

1:02:00.053 --> 1:02:01.888
about what kind of projects
they're working on,

1:02:01.921 --> 1:02:03.256
but there are exceptions.

1:02:03.289 --> 1:02:06.726
<i>I should not have found out</i>
<i>about this online.</i>

1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:08.962
I brought you
into this deal.

1:02:09.062 --> 1:02:11.464
I didn't need you, clearly.

1:02:11.498 --> 1:02:13.166
I did this on my own.

1:02:13.199 --> 1:02:14.601
You're way too busy,

1:02:14.634 --> 1:02:16.069
and not only
that I brought you in,

1:02:16.102 --> 1:02:18.805
but I hyped you up,
and now they signed with you,

1:02:18.838 --> 1:02:21.641
so maybe I had something
to do with it.

1:02:21.675 --> 1:02:22.909
<i>* *</i>

1:02:22.942 --> 1:02:24.344
- Uh, right.

1:02:24.377 --> 1:02:27.280
- After I brought you in
to a project,

1:02:27.313 --> 1:02:28.982
I expected you
to at least tell me

1:02:29.082 --> 1:02:30.083
that you were doing that.

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:31.851
- Do you want to work on it?

1:02:31.885 --> 1:02:33.086
- No.
- Are you sure?

1:02:33.119 --> 1:02:36.456
- Absolutely not.
It's nothing with that.

1:02:36.489 --> 1:02:38.158
It has to do
with principle.

1:02:38.191 --> 1:02:39.693
- I didn't steal
your clients.

1:02:39.726 --> 1:02:41.294
- I'm not--
- They came to me.

1:02:41.327 --> 1:02:43.830
- When they are--hold on.
- I think you're confused.

1:02:43.863 --> 1:02:44.864
Have they worked with you

1:02:44.898 --> 1:02:46.499
on everything
that they've ever done?

1:02:46.533 --> 1:02:48.468
No.

1:02:48.501 --> 1:02:50.203
<i>- It means nothing to him.</i>

1:02:50.236 --> 1:02:52.205
I should have never picked him.

1:02:52.238 --> 1:02:54.374
I should have trusted my gut.

1:02:54.407 --> 1:02:56.743
Integrity is what makes you last
in this business.

1:02:56.776 --> 1:02:58.244
- Integrity?
- Yes.

1:02:58.278 --> 1:02:59.446
- That I didn't call you?

1:02:59.479 --> 1:03:00.814
- Yes.
This is a partnership

1:03:00.847 --> 1:03:03.183
that we have
that hasn't even started,

1:03:03.216 --> 1:03:04.484

You're fired.

I'm not gonna have
