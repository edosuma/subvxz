WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.800
No, no, no.
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.866 --> 00:07.733
Here's what's
on my mind tonight..

00:10.166 --> 00:13.133
Alex is a sculptor,

00:10.166 --> 00:13.133
dying to sell his work.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.066
As I'm sure you know,
an artist's value skyrockets

00:16.133 --> 00:17.700
just as soon as
he or she dies.

00:17.766 --> 00:19.533
Maybe I should
just kill myself.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.633
So he decides
to fake his own death.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.933
The critics will eat this up
and we'll be rich.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.700
But playing dead
can be a real nightmare.

00:29.766 --> 00:32.633
The best insurance for my
investment...is to kill you.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.733
On "Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.233 --> 00:57.533
You're in Springwood now

00:57.600 --> 00:59.666
and you're all mine.

01:28.666 --> 01:30.233
'Music please.'

01:30.300 --> 01:31.600
Well, well.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.600
What have we here?

01:58.766 --> 02:01.466
Interesting piece, Alex.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.233
Yeah, it's profound,
it's beautiful.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.633
Not to mention frightening.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.266
Is it Fabina's body?

02:07.333 --> 02:10.300
No other woman on the planet
has such a perfect form.

02:20.366 --> 02:22.200
And who is this
young character?

02:22.266 --> 02:24.633
Alex, I'm glad you came over.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.000
Listen, I want you to meet

02:26.066 --> 02:28.566
a fabulous new
performance artist.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.933
'Alex, this is Art.'

02:31.866 --> 02:33.500
Art, this is Alex.

02:33.566 --> 02:35.000
Fabina's husband.

02:35.066 --> 02:36.500
'It's nice to meet you, Arthur.'

02:36.566 --> 02:38.800
Just Art.
That's my whole name.

02:38.866 --> 02:40.366
First, middle and last.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.866
Just Art.

02:42.933 --> 02:46.366
You see, I'm the answer
to this question.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.066
Yeah, Art's getting
quite a following.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.933
I see.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.033
What is art, sort of takes on
a whole new meaning, doesn't it?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.900
Well, that's the idea, man.

02:55.966 --> 02:58.100
Nobody really knows
the answer to that question now

02:58.166 --> 03:00.266
do they, Art?

03:00.333 --> 03:02.500
- No.
- Ah.

03:02.566 --> 03:04.600
But I know what isn't art.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.100
And what's that, man?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.100
You.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.666
I feel a sudden urge
to use the bathroom.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.666
- Feel a performance coming on?
- Hey!

03:12.733 --> 03:14.700
What I do...is..

03:15.866 --> 03:17.833
Don't forget to flush.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.800
Mr. Marx.

03:21.866 --> 03:23.300
I respect your opinion.

03:23.366 --> 03:24.666
Do you think this work

03:24.733 --> 03:26.300
is something I might
be able to sell?

03:26.366 --> 03:29.800
Something perhaps
you would even buy yourself?

03:29.866 --> 03:31.400
It's a very disturbing work.

03:31.466 --> 03:32.666
Yes, it is.

03:32.733 --> 03:35.200
But it makes
a powerful statement.

03:35.266 --> 03:38.066
I'm afraid powerful
statements don't sell.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.600
In fact, only two things do.

03:39.666 --> 03:42.266
And what might
those two things be?

03:42.333 --> 03:44.866
The work must either be so
beautiful and attractive

03:44.933 --> 03:46.866
that you want to have it
in your living room.

03:46.933 --> 03:49.433
Or it must be so valuable
that it's a good investment.

03:50.766 --> 03:53.700
And, uh, what is your
opinion of this statue?

03:55.066 --> 03:57.033
This I'm afraid..

03:57.100 --> 03:58.633
...is neither.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.966
I see.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.366
I read that you paid
two million dollars

04:02.433 --> 04:05.400
just last week for
a very ugly Levinsky statue.

04:05.466 --> 04:07.500
Now tell me,
did you pay that price

04:07.566 --> 04:09.200
because it was
a very good investment?

04:09.266 --> 04:11.500
Oh, yes, Andre Levinsky
is a very good investment

04:11.566 --> 04:13.266
because he's dead.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.400
As I'm sure you know
an artist's value

04:15.466 --> 04:18.466
skyrockets the moment
he or she dies.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.833
In fact, possibly
the best career move

04:20.900 --> 04:22.800
Elvis ever made was dying.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.200
Maybe I should just kill myself.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.533
Bonjour.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.100
We're here for
the graduation ceremonies

04:37.166 --> 04:39.000
of the famous Freddy Krueger

04:39.066 --> 04:40.700
School of Art, yes.

04:40.766 --> 04:44.433
World-renowned for
producing suffering artist.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.333
We exclusively use the Van G..

04:48.400 --> 04:49.700
The Van G..

04:51.533 --> 04:53.133
Uh..

04:53.200 --> 04:55.366
That guy's method. Ha ha!

04:55.433 --> 04:57.600
Congratulations, class.

04:57.666 --> 05:00.633
Go forth and suffer.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.400
Has the refuse been removed?

05:09.466 --> 05:11.400
Everyone's gone, Alex.

05:12.466 --> 05:14.433
Everyone except, Mollie.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.833
But then, Mollie is someone.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.100
Aren't you, Mollie?

05:18.166 --> 05:20.133
Sorry, we didn't sell
anything tonight, Alex.

05:21.066 --> 05:22.833
Might take some time.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.966
They're not the most commercial
things in the world.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.666
Oh, explain that to me, Mollie.

05:26.733 --> 05:28.500
Commercial art, explain that.

05:28.566 --> 05:31.200
Alex, come on.
Let Mollie go home.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.000
Thanks, Fabina.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.866
Goodnight, Alex.

05:35.933 --> 05:37.400
Goodnight.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.366
Tsk.

05:43.433 --> 05:44.900
Coming to bed?

05:46.200 --> 05:47.833
In a minute.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.000
Hey!

06:22.600 --> 06:24.766
Wouldn't you rather see..

06:24.833 --> 06:27.733
...the original?

06:27.800 --> 06:31.400
Flesh and blood
version of that body?

06:36.300 --> 06:38.233
I'll be there
in few minutes.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.266
Okay.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.133
Wha.. Why?

07:05.200 --> 07:07.166
It makes a statement.

07:07.233 --> 07:08.966
A profit statement.

07:10.033 --> 07:11.900
Not you too.

07:11.966 --> 07:15.966
Everyone at the party heard you
say you should kill yourself.

07:16.033 --> 07:18.000
'So that's what
it'll look like you did.'

07:19.033 --> 07:21.333
I'm gonna be rich.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.466
Honey, are you okay?

07:33.533 --> 07:35.133
Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.133
I...had a nightmare.

07:40.066 --> 07:41.833
You tried to kill me.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.100
Now, that's silly.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.633
Why would I do that?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.400
I love you.

07:50.466 --> 07:51.900
Do you?

07:57.300 --> 07:59.233
You know I do.

08:00.566 --> 08:02.866
Wouldn't you prefer
a, a younger man?

08:02.933 --> 08:04.966
Someone who's
a little more stable?

08:05.033 --> 08:07.566
You're not unstable.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.700
You're just, um..

08:09.766 --> 08:11.700
...full of passion

08:11.766 --> 08:14.733
and creative energy.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.900
And that's exactly
what I love about you.

08:39.466 --> 08:42.900
I don't see why I can't wear
something underneath all this.

08:42.966 --> 08:44.600
At least underwear.

08:44.666 --> 08:45.600
I can't move.

08:45.666 --> 08:47.666
Well, I worked
a year developing

08:47.733 --> 08:49.900
just the right
cement compound.

08:49.966 --> 08:52.900
Forms to every contour,
every muscle, every detail

08:54.200 --> 08:55.500
So?

08:55.566 --> 08:59.900
So, you took my class at
the university, don't you, Otto?

08:59.966 --> 09:01.233
Yeah.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.500
Well, then you
should understand

09:02.566 --> 09:04.700
the complex beauty
of the human form.

09:06.766 --> 09:08.900
Believe me,
I understand.

09:15.633 --> 09:17.100
I'll get it.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.833
- 'Fabina.'
- Mollie, Hi.

09:23.766 --> 09:25.300
Alright.

09:25.366 --> 09:28.000
I'm gonna cover your nose
and your mouth.

09:28.066 --> 09:30.666
I want you to breathe
through this tube.

09:30.733 --> 09:32.166
Good. Alright.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.233
Now, we're gonna
cut you out of there

09:33.300 --> 09:35.866
just as soon as it all dries.

09:35.933 --> 09:37.800
Alex, it's for you,
she says, it's important.

09:37.866 --> 09:39.800
Alright, alright.
I'm coming.

09:40.733 --> 09:41.933
One second.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.600
Go ahead and put
that last piece on him.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.233
Alright.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.633
Hmm. Hello.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.500
Now, Otto, just
try to relax, okay?

09:49.566 --> 09:51.700
I know, how uncomfortable
this can be.

09:52.866 --> 09:54.800
I've been covered
by ten of them by now.

09:56.766 --> 09:59.633
Only I didn't
have my head covered.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.900
Okay, just breathe.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.600
You did what?

10:08.766 --> 10:09.733
I'll be right back.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.933
Well, thanks for nothing.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.333
What?

10:17.400 --> 10:20.233
That bitch she went
and sold my statue.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.366
'Oh, that's great!'

10:22.433 --> 10:24.066
For a thousand bucks?

10:24.133 --> 10:26.933
It was worth at least ten grand
she didn't even check with me.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.666
Come on, Alex.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.100
Forget it.

10:32.166 --> 10:35.800
Just channel that passion
into the new work.

10:42.066 --> 10:43.833
Oh, my God.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.100
Hey, are you okay, in there?

10:48.166 --> 10:49.933
Hey!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.833
Don't worry, Otto, I'll get
you out of there in a minute.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.900
- What did you do?
- I-I put the last piece on.

11:00.966 --> 11:02.233
Like you told me.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.100
You're suppose to leave the tube
in there so he can breathe!

11:10.500 --> 11:12.800
I thought I did.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.333
It was an accident.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.533
I-it was an accident, I swear.

11:21.766 --> 11:24.233
Oh, what are we gonna do?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.866
Call the police,
what else can we do?

11:27.933 --> 11:29.500
Oh, what if..

11:29.566 --> 11:31.533
What if they wanna
put me in jail?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.733
Alex, what are we gonna do

11:37.233 --> 11:39.200
Alright, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.266
This can work for us.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.533
What?

11:44.666 --> 11:46.133
We can keep you out of trouble
and we can solve

11:46.200 --> 11:49.266
our own money problems
all at the same time.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.300
Oh, I don't understand.

11:53.466 --> 11:56.100
We get Otto out of the cast.
We pour alcohol over him.

11:56.166 --> 11:59.100
Put him in my car
and send him over a cliff.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.233
What? Are you insane?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.233
He's not gonna care.
He's already dead.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.300
Cops will find the car.

12:07.366 --> 12:09.066
They'll identify it as mine.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.400
Uh, because the body was already
covered in so much alcohol

12:11.466 --> 12:12.733
it'll be too burnt
to be recognized.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.833
They'll assume it was me.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.666
I can't believe
you're saying this.

12:15.733 --> 12:17.233
You don't get it, do you?

12:17.300 --> 12:18.800
In the eyes of the art world

12:18.866 --> 12:20.633
I'll be dead.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.133
Play up my death.
Make it sound laureate.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.833
Sensational, an outrageous end

12:24.900 --> 12:27.233
to an all too brief
passionate life.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.733
Oh, boy, the critics
will eat this up.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.700
'My works will
skyrocket in value.'

12:33.766 --> 12:35.733
'And we'll be rich.'

12:37.166 --> 12:39.366
- You're serious, aren't you?
- 'Dead serious.'

12:39.433 --> 12:41.800
Yeah. Very dead serious.

12:41.866 --> 12:43.800
Come on, we'll move to Paris.

12:43.866 --> 12:46.733
Get a little flat
below Montmartre.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.733
Open up our own
little artist cafe.

12:49.966 --> 12:51.966
What do you say?

13:01.133 --> 13:03.233
Can we get a house
in the Riviera?

13:10.266 --> 13:12.066
'I killed a man today.'

13:12.133 --> 13:14.400
'It was an accident.
Now, don't torture yourself.'

13:15.666 --> 13:18.100
Look, in a couple of months
we're gonna be in France.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.200
Couple of months.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.733
I don't know, if I can
stand to wait that long.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.466
Hey, you've got the easy part.
You can come and go.

13:25.533 --> 13:28.400
You know, I've gotta stick
around cooped up in here

13:28.466 --> 13:31.266
I'll go stir-crazy.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.100
You can keep doing your work.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.433
What good is that gonna do
I'm dead, remember?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.233
I'll say I found
them in storage somewhere.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.233
I didn't even know
they existed.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.533
We can do a whole series.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.966
The lost works of Alex McFain.

13:52.033 --> 13:53.333
Right.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.466
You look great!

14:23.533 --> 14:25.666
Alex, don't start, okay?

14:25.733 --> 14:28.100
No, really&lt;TO

14:35.633 --> 14:38.100
The full flush of morning
on your face.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.533
Excuse me if I seem
a little pale.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.500
I've been here for four hours
carrying on

14:41.566 --> 14:42.966
a scintillating conversation

14:43.033 --> 14:45.900
with these four
headless freaks!

14:45.966 --> 14:48.733
And I had been buying food.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.833
For four hours?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.666
Well, I ran
some other errands too.

14:52.733 --> 14:53.933
Errands.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.933
And what is this errands name?

14:56.866 --> 14:58.400
What's that suppose to mean?

14:58.466 --> 15:01.633
Is it that performance artist
that you're so fond of?

15:01.700 --> 15:03.366
What's his name?
Oh, yeah!

15:03.433 --> 15:05.133
Who can forget Art?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.766
What are you talkin' about?

15:06.833 --> 15:10.600
I haven't seen Art since
...our party months ago.

15:10.666 --> 15:11.866
Well, you're doing it
with someone

15:11.933 --> 15:14.500
because you're sure not
doing it with me.

15:14.566 --> 15:16.833
Alright, if you must know.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.133
I spent the last few hours

15:19.200 --> 15:21.500
driving all over the place

15:21.566 --> 15:25.100
trying to find...this
magazine for you.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.533
Mollie told me about it.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.666
'Take a look on pages
78 through 95.'

15:33.733 --> 15:35.700
It's a whole spread on you.

15:41.866 --> 15:44.533
Aside from saying
you were a genius.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.133
It says your art
has skyrocketed in value.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.100
Garrett Marx himself has bought

15:50.166 --> 15:52.133
over two million dollars worth.

16:00.266 --> 16:02.033
I'm sorry.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.833
I-I-I'm scum. I'm..

16:07.966 --> 16:10.200
I'm worse than scum.

16:10.266 --> 16:11.433
It-it's just that

16:11.500 --> 16:13.633
I've been locked up
here for months.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.400
And seeing you come and go
it's-it's making me nuts.

16:18.033 --> 16:19.800
Look, I-I-I'm sorry.

16:23.033 --> 16:24.500
It's-it's okay.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.000
I-I gotta get out of here.

16:27.066 --> 16:29.500
I-I gotta take a walk
or something.

16:29.566 --> 16:31.700
No, Alex, you can't do that.

16:31.766 --> 16:33.433
This is a small town.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.966
Someone sees you
and our whole plan is ruined.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.800
We are going to Paris..

16:43.633 --> 16:45.700
...not to jail.

16:45.766 --> 16:47.533
Hmm?

16:54.433 --> 16:55.900
Okay?

17:28.266 --> 17:30.500
I suspected you might
try something like this.

17:30.566 --> 17:33.933
Mr. Marx, I..
I can explain.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.533
No need.
I understand completely.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.333
You faked your death to increase
the value of your sculpture.

17:40.366 --> 17:41.533
It's fine with me.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.633
You see, I've acquired
almost all of your work.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.833
Well, then we can, we can both
benefit from my little secret.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.600
You don't need
to worry about me.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.166
I won't tell anyone.

17:51.233 --> 17:52.700
The question is..

17:52.766 --> 17:55.566
How can I be certain that you
won't do something stupid

17:55.633 --> 17:57.433
like go out in public?

17:58.666 --> 18:01.566
Now it seems the best insurance
for my investment..

18:01.633 --> 18:03.100
...is to kill you.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.700
- For real.
- Bu-b-b..

18:10.900 --> 18:12.533
Are you okay?

18:15.466 --> 18:17.333
Yeah.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.333
I think, it's time
we, uh, sold the statues

18:19.400 --> 18:21.333
and just leave town.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.966
I don't understand
why it took you so long

18:29.033 --> 18:31.200
to find these statues.

18:31.266 --> 18:34.233
Ah, I didn't know Alex,
had that, uh, warehouse space

18:34.300 --> 18:37.166
where they were stored
until yesterday.

18:37.233 --> 18:39.600
I got a notice saying
that they were evicting hi

18:39.666 --> 18:42.033
for not paying the bill.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.666
Do you know how much
these things are worth?

18:44.733 --> 18:46.700
Um, no, not really.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.566
Let's just say..

18:49.633 --> 18:52.100
...you'll never have to
work again.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.833
You mean you
can still sell them?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.866
They'll be lining up
at my door.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.566
I'll send a truck over
first thing in the morning

18:58.633 --> 19:00.133
to pick them up, okay?

19:00.200 --> 19:02.100
I'll be here.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.100
Thanks, Mollie.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.400
Poor, Alex.

19:07.466 --> 19:10.400
He'll never get to enjoy
all this money.

19:10.466 --> 19:12.600
You'll just have
to enjoy it for him.

19:18.233 --> 19:20.200
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.233
'Did you hear that?'

19:27.733 --> 19:29.833
You'll never have to work again.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.833
I like the way
she put that, huh?

19:33.233 --> 19:34.566
Isn't that great?

19:34.633 --> 19:37.200
Um, listen I have to go
to the travel agent

19:37.266 --> 19:39.400
and pick up
the airline tickets.

19:39.466 --> 19:41.766
Oh, you have to go
right now!

19:43.200 --> 19:45.500
Well, yeah. I told him
I'd be there this morning.

19:46.933 --> 19:49.566
How far is this, uh,
travel agency?

19:49.633 --> 19:51.566
I don't know, about, uh..

19:51.633 --> 19:53.533
...fifteen minutes each way.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.100
Good, then you should be back
in about half an hour, right?

19:57.300 --> 20:00.000
Give or take. Why?

20:00.066 --> 20:01.433
Because if you're not,
that way I'll know

20:01.500 --> 20:03.433
that you're at his place.

20:04.366 --> 20:05.433
Whose place?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.000
Whoever, whoever
you have an affair with.

20:07.066 --> 20:09.300
That, that punk
with the tattoo maybe.

20:13.966 --> 20:16.833
You know, not that
you deserve a reply but..

20:16.900 --> 20:19.933
...why would I'd be so anxious
to go to Europe with you

20:20.000 --> 20:22.733
i-if I'm having an affair
with another guy, right here?

20:29.233 --> 20:31.200
I'll be back in half hour.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.666
'Oh, yeah.'

21:13.733 --> 21:15.700
'Oh, yeah.'

21:31.700 --> 21:33.600
Hey, man, what do you
think you're doing?

21:45.700 --> 21:48.266
Whoa, hold on! Now, you think
about what you're doing.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.200
Why? The moment's happening.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.600
What, what, what moment?

21:52.666 --> 21:54.966
It's a piece called
performance art.

21:55.033 --> 21:57.400
It's called Art Imitating Death.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.666
- What are you doing?
- Uh, cleaning up, honey.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.700
Hi, Alex, how's the water?

22:06.766 --> 22:08.733
Mollie, uh..

22:10.066 --> 22:12.033
No need to get up, Alex.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.766
You don't seem
very surprised to see me.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.700
Of course not, Alex.

22:18.766 --> 22:20.966
I knew you were alive all along.

22:21.033 --> 22:22.333
What?

22:23.766 --> 22:26.800
This has been the happiest
time of my life, Alex.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.400
I got to trade
the collected works

22:30.466 --> 22:32.266
of the late Alex McFain

22:32.333 --> 22:36.166
'which are worth more money
than I ever dreamt possible.'

22:36.233 --> 22:38.666
Do you know why
I'm really happy?

22:38.733 --> 22:41.266
No. Why?

22:41.333 --> 22:43.600
'Cause I get to
keep the original..

22:48.433 --> 22:50.733
Just, what's that
suppose to mean?

22:53.433 --> 22:55.333
You were right, Alex.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.533
I was having an affair.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.233
We're in love, Alex.

23:08.166 --> 23:09.600
You're not serious.

23:12.733 --> 23:14.300
Mollie..

23:14.366 --> 23:15.866
...what are you doing?

23:15.933 --> 23:17.800
I'm repeating history, Alex.

23:17.866 --> 23:20.033
You're about to die again.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.533
You know, I just never knew

23:21.600 --> 23:24.000
you had such a sense
of humor, Mollie.

23:24.066 --> 23:27.200
Why don't you just go ahead and
kill me for real the first time?

23:27.266 --> 23:30.733
Because then we wouldn't have
the lost works of Alex McFain.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.633
Why these statues alone will
net us five million dollars.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.033
'Plus, we wanted to wait
until the smoke cleared'

23:37.100 --> 23:38.766
from your first death.

23:38.833 --> 23:41.433
That way no one will miss you.

23:41.500 --> 23:45.133
Can't murder a man
if he's already dead, right?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.433
'Look up, Alex.'

23:47.500 --> 23:48.933
Meet your maker.

23:50.233 --> 23:51.933
No!

23:52.000 --> 23:53.800
Hey, you!

23:53.866 --> 23:55.666
Coming to my boudoir?

23:55.733 --> 23:58.400
I want to show you
some etchings.

24:06.033 --> 24:08.600
Probably, a real good
investment too.

24:08.666 --> 24:11.200
I mean, after all, I'm dead.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.000
Wow! Too hot.

24:41.066 --> 24:43.666
Stacy, you're spilling
crumbs all over.

24:43.733 --> 24:44.866
So?

24:44.933 --> 24:46.900
So, potential roommates
are coming over.

24:46.966 --> 24:49.533
Who's gonna wanna live with us
if we look like slobs?

24:49.600 --> 24:50.666
I don't know.

24:50.733 --> 24:52.433
Another slob?

24:58.633 --> 25:00.066
Do me a favor, Stacy.

25:00.133 --> 25:02.900
Don't act like a wild woman.

25:02.966 --> 25:05.100
Only if you do me a favor, Gina.

25:05.166 --> 25:07.300
Don't act like you have
a stick up your butt.

25:14.766 --> 25:17.400
Ooh, there, looks like
I took the express elevator

25:17.466 --> 25:18.600
straight to heaven.

25:18.666 --> 25:20.033
Who are you?

25:20.100 --> 25:21.633
I'm Art.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.100
Ooh, burn.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.366
Um..

25:25.433 --> 25:27.800
I'm looking for Fabina.
Is she around?

25:27.866 --> 25:31.300
Oh, there's no one
named Fabina living here.

25:31.366 --> 25:34.133
I just got back into town,
she's not even here?

25:35.833 --> 25:37.966
Uh, apparently not,
so, if you'll excuse us

25:38.033 --> 25:39.933
we have company coming up.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.900
Oh, I'm sorry, uh..

25:41.966 --> 25:45.300
- Sorry I bothered you.
- Hey, it's okay. No harm done.

25:48.133 --> 25:50.866
Um, I'm here about
the female roommate wanted ad.

25:50.933 --> 25:53.066
Oh, yes, come in. I'm Gina.

25:53.133 --> 25:54.166
- Hi.
- This is Stacy.

25:54.233 --> 25:55.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.433
I'm Art.
Gina's and Stacy's lover.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.033
They share everything.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.433
Um...I was kind of
looking for a bigger place

26:05.500 --> 26:06.766
Thanks, anyway.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.433
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.533
May I ask why you did that?

26:10.600 --> 26:12.433
You certainly may.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.800
I figure..

26:13.866 --> 26:16.266
...if I can chase off
one perspective roomie

26:16.333 --> 26:18.100
then my odds get
that much better.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.166
Odds of what?

26:20.233 --> 26:21.833
Moving in with you girls.

26:21.900 --> 26:24.266
- Not a chance.
- 'Why not?'

26:24.333 --> 26:26.033
I mean..

26:26.100 --> 26:27.666
...you said you needed
a roommate, didn't you?

26:27.733 --> 26:29.666
Afe

26:29.733 --> 26:31.433
Male, female,
what's the difference?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.366
Yeah, Gina,
what's the difference?

26:33.433 --> 26:35.833
Art seems kind of fun.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.433
Stacy, we'll lose our privacy.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.633
We won't be able to
go to the bathroom

26:39.700 --> 26:41.800
without putting
clothes on first.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.600
'Sure, you will.'

26:45.133 --> 26:47.000
I-I can hang a sheet
from the corner

26:47.066 --> 26:49.033
and, a-and that'll
be my bedroom.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.466
I really need a place to live.

26:54.533 --> 26:56.500
I just got kicked out
of my apartment.

26:56.566 --> 26:58.333
Oh, great!
So, you're a troublemaker.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.933
No, I..

27:03.933 --> 27:07.033
I rescued a stray dog
that was hit by a car.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.600
And I took it home
and nursed it back to health.

27:10.666 --> 27:12.100
A-and then
my landlord found out

27:12.166 --> 27:14.900
and so he kicked me out
'cause he doesn't love pets.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.433
I've been sleeping
in my car ever since.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.466
Well, where's the dog?

27:22.533 --> 27:25.866
Oh, I-I, I had to give it
to a family that, um..

27:25.933 --> 27:27.800
...had a kid to love her and..

27:27.866 --> 27:29.800
...this yard to play in.

27:33.466 --> 27:35.633
Well, what do you say?

27:35.700 --> 27:37.966
Save me from the homelessness.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.300
Oh, we don't even
have a bed for you.

27:42.333 --> 27:44.300
I can sleep in the bath tub.

27:52.433 --> 27:54.833
Well...okay.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.600
'Under one condition.'

27:57.433 --> 27:58.400
'If it's not working out'

27:58.466 --> 28:01.166
we can throw you out
at any time.

28:01.233 --> 28:02.366
'Okay?'

28:02.433 --> 28:04.700
You got yourself a deal.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.166
Deal?

28:07.233 --> 28:09.566
Huh? That guy cut a bad deal.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.833
Has he ever heard
about the old saying

28:11.900 --> 28:14.233
whoever can't live with him

28:14.300 --> 28:16.600
can't live..

28:16.666 --> 28:18.000
...with him.

28:29.766 --> 28:31.233
Come in.

28:34.533 --> 28:35.833
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're studying.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.466
I'll come back.

28:37.533 --> 28:38.900
What do you want?

28:38.966 --> 28:40.733
Well..

28:40.800 --> 28:42.666
...I sense you don't
like me very much

28:42.733 --> 28:44.233
and I figure if we're
gonna share this place

28:44.300 --> 28:45.533
we should get along.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.466
So?

28:48.533 --> 28:50.733
So, I thought it might be
nice we could talk a little.

28:52.166 --> 28:54.233
I'm really not that bad of
a guy once you get to know me.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.033
Okay. Let's talk.

29:02.933 --> 29:04.566
So..

29:04.633 --> 29:06.300
...I see you're into ecology.

29:06.366 --> 29:07.700
It's important.

29:07.766 --> 29:09.033
I know.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.300
Tell me more about
what you're into.

29:10.366 --> 29:12.333
Maybe I can get involved again.

29:14.366 --> 29:17.633
Somehow I doubt you were ever
active in ecological causes.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.466
That's where you're wrong.

29:20.533 --> 29:23.333
I spent all of '88 on
a boat with a friend of mine

29:23.400 --> 29:25.333
cutting tuna nets
to save dolphins.

29:26.466 --> 29:28.400
You? I'm sure.

29:28.466 --> 29:29.766
Scout's honor.

29:29.833 --> 29:32.066
The only reason we quit
was because one of the..

29:32.133 --> 29:33.566
...tuna companies..

29:33.633 --> 29:35.400
...put a price on our heads.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.733
See this scar?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.700
'Harpoon.'

29:44.766 --> 29:47.233
One of the fisherman shot me
when I was cuttin' his net.

29:50.366 --> 29:52.700
How do I know that's
not from a motorcycle accident

29:52.766 --> 29:54.733
or a football injury
or something?

29:58.100 --> 30:00.233
Why would I lie
about something like this?

30:01.466 --> 30:03.133
To make me like you.

30:05.333 --> 30:07.266
It's a good reason.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.233
But I'm telling you the truth.

30:10.533 --> 30:13.200
It's the reason
I'm in Springwood.

30:13.266 --> 30:16.233
I figured the fishermen
will never look this far inland.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.633
Well, I have to study.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.766
Can we continue
this conversation later?

30:22.833 --> 30:24.700
Yeah. Sure.

30:29.733 --> 30:30.933
Study hard.

30:43.866 --> 30:44.966
Who is it?

30:45.033 --> 30:47.000
'It's Troy Richardson,
friend of Art's.'

30:47.066 --> 30:48.333
'Is he up there?'

30:48.400 --> 30:50.500
Let him up.

30:50.566 --> 30:52.633
Yes, come in.

30:52.700 --> 30:55.100
Your friends always
visit this late?

30:55.166 --> 30:57.100
No, something must be wrong.

31:03.133 --> 31:04.433
Oh, my God.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.700
Arthur, they're in town.
They found me.

31:09.866 --> 31:11.466
Barely got away.

31:11.533 --> 31:12.700
Art, they were trying
to kill me.

31:12.766 --> 31:14.700
Troy, Troy, slow down.
Who did this?

31:14.766 --> 31:16.733
Fishermen, two of 'em.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.666
You need to go
to the hospital.

31:18.733 --> 31:20.966
I wanted to warn you Art.

31:21.033 --> 31:22.466
Who are you?

31:22.533 --> 31:24.166
This is Gina. My new roommate.

31:24.233 --> 31:25.366
Gina, this is my friend Troy.

31:26.466 --> 31:27.833
He was in the boat with me.

31:29.033 --> 31:29.966
Listen, man, I'm taking you

31:30.033 --> 31:31.500
to the hospital.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.500
I'm sorry about this, Gina.

31:34.566 --> 31:35.900
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, no, no.

31:35.966 --> 31:37.733
I'll be back later.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.033
- Who is it?
- 'It's me Art.'

32:13.866 --> 32:15.166
How long have you been home?

32:15.233 --> 32:17.100
An hour maybe. Why?

32:17.166 --> 32:19.466
I just buzzed you in.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.800
- What?
- I was just wondering.

32:57.766 --> 32:59.533
Weren't you afraid out there?

33:00.933 --> 33:02.100
Out where?

33:02.166 --> 33:05.100
Out at sea.
Saving the dolphins.

33:05.166 --> 33:07.500
Weren't you scared you
would get killed or something?

33:09.233 --> 33:11.233
Yeah, I was scared.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.800
But I figured..

33:17.200 --> 33:19.366
...hundreds of dolphins lives

33:19.433 --> 33:22.000
were worth risking
my one life for.

33:32.466 --> 33:34.600
Well, goodnight.

33:51.833 --> 33:53.900
I was just wondering..

33:54.866 --> 33:56.833
...do you find me attractive?

33:56.900 --> 33:59.733
I think you're the most
attractive woman I've ever met.

34:00.933 --> 34:03.033
Strange.

34:03.100 --> 34:06.400
Suddenly you're the most
attractive man I've ever met.

34:22.333 --> 34:25.100
Oops. Sorry I didn't know
you weren't dressed.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.200
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't know
you weren't dressed.

34:30.266 --> 34:33.400
Oh, it's o, it's okay,
you can come in.

34:33.466 --> 34:36.233
I-I just,
I just wanted to talk.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.033
Oh! About what?

34:39.500 --> 34:42.400
Well, I figured as long
as we are going to be roommates

34:42.466 --> 34:45.200
you know we oughta get to know
each other a little bit better.

34:45.266 --> 34:47.433
Okay. Sounds good.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.433
Come on.

34:52.466 --> 34:53.966
So you're a Bon Jovi fan?

34:54.033 --> 34:57.133
Oh, are you kidding?
He's all I listen to.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.900
How about you?
You like Bon Jovi?

34:58.966 --> 35:00.433
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little tired of him

35:00.500 --> 35:03.033
after hearing live every night
for a year.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.100
Oh, God, don't tell me
you're one of those groupies

35:05.166 --> 35:06.100
that followed him
around everywhere.

35:06.166 --> 35:07.566
No, no.

35:07.633 --> 35:11.800
I worked, uh, security
for the, uh, Brotherhood tour.

35:11.866 --> 35:13.100
Get out of here, you did not.

35:13.166 --> 35:15.566
Yeah, I did.
Well, not for the whole tour.

35:15.633 --> 35:18.666
Just...till I was injured.

35:18.733 --> 35:20.333
You were injured?

35:20.400 --> 35:23.200
Yeah, see,
there was this big guy..

35:25.500 --> 35:26.500
...you know one
of those groupies that you

35:26.566 --> 35:28.666
just accused me of being.

35:28.733 --> 35:31.500
This guy, he would follow us
everywhere we went.

35:31.566 --> 35:35.000
And every night he tried to get
to Jon Bon Jovi backstage.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.166
Finally, one night in Detroit

35:37.233 --> 35:39.933
he got a little too close
and I had to deck him.

35:43.066 --> 35:44.033
'That's how I got this.'

35:46.633 --> 35:49.200
Turns out that this guy
was the son

35:49.266 --> 35:52.500
of this big mobster named
Tony Pucelli.

35:52.566 --> 35:54.333
That's a great fairy tale.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.800
Tell me another one.

35:55.866 --> 35:58.566
I'm telling you
the truth, I swear.

35:58.633 --> 35:59.600
That's why I'm in Springwood.

35:59.666 --> 36:00.900
I figure..

36:00.966 --> 36:02.600
I figured, Pucelli's thugs

36:02.666 --> 36:05.166
the-the-they'll never look
in a small town like this.

36:05.233 --> 36:07.800
Yeah, and I suppose they have
a contract out to kill you?

36:07.866 --> 36:10.833
No, not to kill me,
just to break both my knees.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.233
Alright, look, I gotta study.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.600
Alright, I'll leave.

36:16.666 --> 36:18.533
Okay.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.700
But I'm hurt
that you don't believe me.

36:22.133 --> 36:23.233
Okay.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.933
- Hello.
- 'Yeah, pizza delivery.'

36:36.000 --> 36:38.233
Oh, that's mine. Buzz him up.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.933
Oh, okay.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.033
You planning
to share that pizza?

36:44.233 --> 36:45.933
With a girl
who thinks I'm a liar?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.933
I didn't mean that.

36:50.366 --> 36:53.300
Artie...how are ya?

36:53.366 --> 36:54.866
Guido, how'd you find me?

36:54.933 --> 36:56.433
Hey, you should know
by now, Artie

36:56.500 --> 36:58.666
you can run
but you can't hide.

36:58.733 --> 37:01.100
Mr. Pucelli,
he wants your knees broke.

37:02.466 --> 37:04.166
That's what I'm gonna give him.

37:04.233 --> 37:06.233
Why don't you beat it on
outta of here, buddy?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.133
Well, well, well,
what have we got here, Artie?

37:08.200 --> 37:09.533
New girlfriend?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.166
You leave her out of this.
This is between you and me, man.

37:12.233 --> 37:13.733
What's your name, sweetie?

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
Stacy.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.500
Stacy.

37:17.700 --> 37:20.266
Hey, Stacy, you ever do it
in an elevator?

37:20.333 --> 37:22.300
Hey, I said leave her alone.

37:23.466 --> 37:24.933
You're one dumb guy, Artie.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.400
Now, you're one dead one too.

37:30.933 --> 37:33.533
There's a cop who hangs ou
at the station down there.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.900
I think he might like
to meet a guy like you.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.400
I'll be back.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.266
Hope I didn't hit you too hard.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.533
No, I couldn't feel a thing
with this cup on.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.666
I tell you, man,
that one would have earned us

37:54.733 --> 37:56.266
an A in stage combat class

37:56.333 --> 37:57.733
Yeah, you think
she went for it?

37:57.800 --> 37:58.766
I don't know.

38:25.366 --> 38:26.933
I thought you were
in jail, man.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.933
Mr. Pucelli takes care
of his people.

38:30.000 --> 38:30.966
What are you gonna do?

38:31.033 --> 38:32.866
My boss wants your knees broke.

38:32.933 --> 38:34.700
That's what he's gonna get.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.666
It's only me.

39:14.733 --> 39:16.533
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.233
Gosh, that mobster guy
has you pretty jumpy, huh?

39:20.700 --> 39:22.600
Yeah. I guess, so.

39:24.433 --> 39:26.533
You really worked for Bon Jovi?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.833
Yeah, for, um, almost a year.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.466
I bet you met a lot
of pretty girls on tour, huh?

39:36.533 --> 39:40.466
Yeah. But, uh, none of the
came close to you.

39:40.533 --> 39:41.800
Oh, God.
You don't have to say that.

39:41.866 --> 39:44.700
I know I don't have to say that,
but it's true.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.133
You're spectacular.

39:48.566 --> 39:50.600
You're pretty special yourself.

40:11.166 --> 40:12.833
Let's get naked.

40:27.666 --> 40:29.266
He's kinda cute, isn't he?

40:29.333 --> 40:31.066
Mm-hmm.

40:31.133 --> 40:33.833
That poor boy
is in so much danger.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.033
He told you about that too?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.866
Mm-hmm.

40:36.933 --> 40:39.166
You know what we should do

40:39.233 --> 40:40.633
We should change the locks

40:40.700 --> 40:42.933
Oh, I doubt if that'll help.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.133
The guys that are after him
could probably

40:44.200 --> 40:46.266
get through anything.

40:46.333 --> 40:47.400
Yeah.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.200
That mob guy is pretty tough.

40:50.266 --> 40:51.300
Mob guy?

40:51.366 --> 40:53.200
Yeah, the guy that's after Art.

40:54.866 --> 40:58.000
I didn't know tuna fishermen
are tied to organized crime.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.533
Tuna fishermen?

41:00.600 --> 41:03.033
Yeah, that's who's after Art.

41:04.933 --> 41:06.200
Tuna fishermen?

41:06.266 --> 41:09.300
Yeah, he cut their nets
to save the dolphins.

41:10.966 --> 41:12.400
Is that what he told you?

41:12.466 --> 41:14.333
Yeah. Why?

41:19.233 --> 41:21.200
What did he tellyou?

41:23.600 --> 41:26.533
'Oh, A-A-Art.'

41:30.900 --> 41:32.066
Good morning, Art.

41:32.133 --> 41:33.100
Morning.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.100
We've been comparing notes.

41:37.166 --> 41:39.466
You are one hot lover.

41:39.533 --> 41:42.866
Hmm, red hot.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.933
But we thought you could be
just a little hotter.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.433
Good morning, girls.

42:09.500 --> 42:12.166
We want you out of here
by nightfall.

42:12.233 --> 42:14.800
Why? We were getting
along so good.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.633
You know why
you son of a bitch.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.333
Take your scars,
take your lies and get out.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.600
Wait, wait, wait.

42:20.666 --> 42:23.333
Are you sure you wanna do this?

42:23.400 --> 42:24.666
'Two beautiful girls like you'

42:24.733 --> 42:27.033
should not be living
in this awful neighborhood.

42:28.266 --> 42:29.966
'You need a guy around
to protect you.'

42:30.033 --> 42:31.100
- A guy like me.
- Yeah?

42:31.166 --> 42:32.900
And who's gonna protect us
fromy

42:32.966 --> 42:34.833
Get lost, dirt bag.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.766
You sure you don't
want me to stay?

42:49.833 --> 42:51.600
For your own safety?

42:51.666 --> 42:53.200
Just get the hell out of here.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.600
Okay, listen good.

42:54.666 --> 42:56.233
Everyone does as they're told
and nobody gets hurt.

42:57.233 --> 42:59.466
Well, if it isn't Art's friend.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.433
What's your name?
Is it Troy?

43:01.500 --> 43:03.400
No he called
himself Guido for me.

43:03.466 --> 43:05.666
Oh, you're a very good actor,
pal, nice voice change.

43:05.733 --> 43:06.766
Shut up!

43:06.833 --> 43:07.800
Girls, this isn't
who you think it is.

43:07.866 --> 43:08.800
Now put your hands up.

43:08.866 --> 43:10.266
Why you think you can scare us

43:10.333 --> 43:11.500
into letting you stay here

43:11.566 --> 43:13.166
Hey, I don't know anything
about this. I swear.

43:13.233 --> 43:14.566
Hey, I already killed
four people

43:14.633 --> 43:16.133
three more ain't gonna make
much difference.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.600
- 'Now do what I say.'
- No way.

43:17.666 --> 43:19.833
- Not a chance.
- You want me to kill this guy?

43:19.900 --> 43:21.766
Gina.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.933
- Sure!
- We don't like him much anyway.

43:30.933 --> 43:32.200
Pick up the gun!

43:32.266 --> 43:33.800
Very good performance.

43:33.866 --> 43:35.166
Kick him like you did
last time, Art.

43:35.233 --> 43:37.200
Pick up the damn gun.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.266
Now, point it at him
while I call the cops.

43:41.333 --> 43:43.033
You know,
you could have at least used

43:43.100 --> 43:45.200
a realistic looking gun,
that one's so fake.

43:45.266 --> 43:47.400
It's a real gun, Gina.
Point it at him!

43:47.466 --> 43:49.066
Games' over, Art.
It's fake.

43:49.133 --> 43:50.566
And I'll prove it.

43:50.633 --> 43:52.600
No!

43:58.666 --> 43:59.933
Very good.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.933
- Nice death scene, guys.
- Mm-hmm.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.700
Is that fake blood like
they use in the movies or what?

44:06.833 --> 44:09.933
Okay, Guido or Troy
or whatever your name is.

44:11.966 --> 44:13.933
We're not falling for it.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.300
Ugh.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.466
That's not Troy.

44:28.533 --> 44:29.933
It's not Guido, either.

44:32.300 --> 44:35.433
Oh, my God.
He's really dead.

44:44.066 --> 44:46.066
'Some people say
anything to get'

44:46.133 --> 44:48.233
what they want from a chick.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.700
This guy said
he was a friend of mine.

44:50.766 --> 44:53.766
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

44:57.033 --> 44:58.033
Hey, babe.
