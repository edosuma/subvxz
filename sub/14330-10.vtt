18:57.503 --> 18:58.937
HE'S MY BABY!

18:59.004 --> 19:00.839

22:05.357 --> 22:07.225
THE SHARPEST KNIFE

22:07.292 --> 22:09.661
- NOPE, THAT ONE'S IN MY SPLEEN.

22:09.728 --> 22:13.031
- BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
THE EMPEROR ISN'T SAYING

22:13.098 --> 22:15.500
WHAT YOU SAY HE'S SAYING.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.135
