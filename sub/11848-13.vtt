01:51.223 --> 01:53.523
Heh-heh.
I can't wait.

02:10.193 --> 02:13.983
Stranger.  Is it true
you are all hung like horses?

02:14.626 --> 02:17.196
Yes, he's had the taste
of our women.

02:17.196 --> 02:18.995
And likes it!

02:36.965 --> 02:38.231
Another dead one.

02:40.965 --> 02:44.499
She's heavy as lead.

02:44.499 --> 02:47.866
Maybe with child.

03:11.404 --> 03:13.004
Rest in peace.

03:21.539 --> 03:22.973
Goodbye.

06:00.699 --> 06:04.801
Hey, you!  You in
the fancy clothes!

06:27.637 --> 06:29.137
Get out there!

06:29.138 --> 06:30.971
Go! Go! Go!

06:30.972 --> 06:32.671
To work!

06:32.672 --> 06:34.905
Move it!

06:45.007 --> 06:47.104
What are you?

06:47.106 --> 06:48.704
Dutch?

06:48.708 --> 06:50.874
English?

06:50.875 --> 06:52.939
American!

06:53.042 --> 06:55.605
Aha! I thought so!

06:56.609 --> 06:59.505
Well, you'd better
get a move on.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.276
Why, it will be morning.

07:01.576 --> 07:05.601
What is done here is
best done in the dark.

07:05.676 --> 07:11.578
Come to stick it between
the girl's legs, didn't ya?

07:12.278 --> 07:18.012
- I'm looking for a girl.
- I have lots of girls.

07:18.479 --> 07:23.166
No, no.
A very special girl.

07:23.379 --> 07:25.314
Her name is Komomo.

07:29.882 --> 07:36.488
Never heard... of a girl... called that.

07:37.216 --> 07:39.416
She's not on this island.

07:40.349 --> 07:44.451
Well, that being the case,

07:45.918 --> 07:47.918
I'll be movin' along.

07:49.885 --> 07:52.450
No no no.
Not tonight.

07:52.452 --> 07:55.085
No boat until morning, mister.

07:57.952 --> 08:02.091
You have to spend
the evening somewhere.

08:02.155 --> 08:06.785
So... why not here?

08:06.788 --> 08:08.315
Come in. Come in.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.550
Come in...

08:10.555 --> 08:15.791
I'll give ya good price.
And a better lady.

08:23.991 --> 08:26.024
The one in the back.

09:03.163 --> 09:05.029
Bon appetit.

09:17.128 --> 09:20.462
Once upon a time,

09:21.495 --> 09:25.596
I held a woman named
Komomo in my arms.

09:25.631 --> 09:29.361
She was sad.
And so beautiful.

09:29.661 --> 09:32.395
But more than this,
she truly was

09:32.495 --> 09:37.032
an unfortunate woman,
who was the love of my life.

09:37.841 --> 09:41.535
I had promised her that
I would come back for her,

09:41.540 --> 09:45.005
and take her home to
America with me, but...

09:45.006 --> 09:49.104
by the time I finally
got back, she was gone.

09:49.104 --> 09:51.670
Sold off to some...

09:51.770 --> 09:56.070
to a far-distant brothel
house, somewhere.

09:56.170 --> 09:59.102
So I spent
my years wandering

09:59.202 --> 10:02.767
all over this land,
searching for her,

10:02.867 --> 10:08.398
following every clue,
every hint of a clue

10:08.498 --> 10:10.766
in the process.

10:11.066 --> 10:13.798
It's exhausted me.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.663
So I'm tired.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.408
Tonight,

11:34.409 --> 11:36.773
I am yours.

11:36.873 --> 11:39.639
You may do what
you wish with me.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.206
Are you from America?

11:59.400 --> 12:03.329
Why were you sitting so far
away from the windows?

12:03.666 --> 12:08.464
Don't the women usually
call out to the men?

12:08.764 --> 12:10.497
I'm afraid.

12:12.696 --> 12:15.098
What are you afraid of?

12:16.228 --> 12:19.193
The ones who grab my hands.

12:19.893 --> 12:21.909
The lost souls.

12:31.591 --> 12:33.657
Look!
They're here!

12:58.815 --> 13:01.149
I've been cursed
from birth.

13:01.249 --> 13:04.148
I feel closer to the dead
than the living.

13:04.248 --> 13:06.347
The living are the ones
who really...

13:06.447 --> 13:07.713
scare me.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.979
Been my experience that the living

13:11.079 --> 13:15.284
cause much more pain than the dead.

13:17.343 --> 13:19.958
You don't think I'm strange?

13:20.477 --> 13:23.780
You don't think...
I'm a freak?

13:24.708 --> 13:29.806
I find almost everything strange.

13:35.872 --> 13:38.544
You're looking for Komomo.

13:41.703 --> 13:43.544
Do you know her?

13:44.671 --> 13:49.356
If you find her, what do you plan to do?

13:49.368 --> 13:52.257
Oh, I plan...

13:52.399 --> 13:55.363
what I planned from the
first moment I saw her.

13:55.463 --> 13:58.328
Take her to America.
Start both our lives

13:58.428 --> 14:00.829
all over again.

14:01.029 --> 14:03.227
Give to her the life
that she deserved.

14:03.327 --> 14:05.691
I promised her that.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.037
- Poor Komomo.
- Where is she?

14:12.256 --> 14:15.955
She came here to the island
about half a year ago, but...

14:17.321 --> 14:21.421
I'm sorry.  She passed
away not long ago.

14:23.218 --> 14:25.939
Oh, God...

14:26.216 --> 14:27.696
God...

14:28.216 --> 14:29.573
Damn!

14:34.178 --> 14:36.178
What happened?

14:36.478 --> 14:38.297
She hung herself.

14:38.332 --> 14:40.010
Why would she do that?

14:40.110 --> 14:43.142
She could wait no longer
for the man she loved.

14:45.074 --> 14:46.874
You lie!

14:48.306 --> 14:49.572
It's no lie.

14:49.672 --> 14:52.138
She rests at the temple
on the bank of the river.

14:59.767 --> 15:03.033
So you were that man.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.565
Her special love.

15:04.565 --> 15:09.560
Never mentioned a word to you
that I was an American.

15:09.563 --> 15:11.060
I guess she just thought

15:11.062 --> 15:15.790
"Just another god
damn lying Yankee!"

15:15.794 --> 15:20.156
Never intended on coming back
for her in the first place.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.520
Wait!
Don't go!

15:25.523 --> 15:27.420
There's nothing
but cut-throats outside!

15:27.421 --> 15:31.285
Ah God, God,
God damn!

15:31.287 --> 15:33.680
This island isn't
in the human world.

15:33.685 --> 15:36.383
Demons and whores are
the only ones living here.

15:44.814 --> 15:46.345
I know you suffer.

15:48.445 --> 15:50.712
But you can't change the past.

15:53.075 --> 15:54.876
Komomo is gone.

15:57.574 --> 15:59.507
You cannot bring her back.

15:59.607 --> 16:02.935
Ohhh, God...

16:02.938 --> 16:05.370
Oh, God. Oh, God.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.267
What did you love about her?

16:18.365 --> 16:23.060
Oh, so many things...

16:23.062 --> 16:25.790
So many things.
So many things.

16:25.794 --> 16:30.026
So many things.
So many things.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.224
She reminded me of my sister.

16:37.988 --> 16:42.419
My dead... little sister.

16:42.519 --> 16:44.385
Oh...
Your sister?

16:46.518 --> 16:50.282
Aw, I guess you think
I'm the strange one now.

16:52.050 --> 16:54.746
I'm the last woman to judge any man.

16:56.747 --> 16:58.347
Have some sake.

16:59.378 --> 17:01.679
It's the best way to forget.

17:03.310 --> 17:06.441
Oh, God...

18:11.144 --> 18:13.777
Aren't you ever going to sleep?

18:16.075 --> 18:18.041
Showing your sleeping face

18:18.141 --> 18:19.874
is the greatest disgrace

18:19.974 --> 18:21.540
for a lady in my trade.

18:27.438 --> 18:29.635
It's hot.

18:30.035 --> 18:32.968
But at least this keeps
the mosquitoes off.

18:39.433 --> 18:40.958
Is something wrong?

18:44.496 --> 18:48.161
Uh, maybe too much sake.

18:51.894 --> 18:52.993
Good sir.

18:58.123 --> 18:59.089
All of the men

18:59.189 --> 19:01.989
rave about me being a fine fit.

19:03.321 --> 19:05.453
Care to try?

19:05.553 --> 19:07.151
I'll let you do anything.

19:09.251 --> 19:11.151
Not right now.

19:14.783 --> 19:15.816
I understand.

19:15.916 --> 19:16.814
Who'd want to lay

19:16.914 --> 19:20.513
with such an ugly
woman like me, huh?

19:20.713 --> 19:24.243
Please don't
misunderstand me.

19:24.443 --> 19:26.043
I find you...

19:28.843 --> 19:30.875
very attractive.

19:30.975 --> 19:32.474
It's just...

19:32.974 --> 19:34.273
tonight...

19:35.672 --> 19:37.805
Not tonight, no.

19:37.905 --> 19:39.804
Not tonight.

19:44.568 --> 19:46.869
Maybe...

19:46.869 --> 19:50.000
you should just relax
and fall asleep.

19:53.897 --> 19:56.230
Tell me a story.

19:56.330 --> 20:00.161
Bedtime story,
about you.

20:00.261 --> 20:02.893
Oh...about me?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.559
I'm a journalist.

20:05.793 --> 20:09.657
That's what I do.
I listen to stories.

20:09.757 --> 20:11.688
But even if I wasn't,

20:11.788 --> 20:15.453
I would want
to hear your story.

20:16.854 --> 20:20.552
You are a strange one, mister.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.084
Normally,

20:22.184 --> 20:24.251
men don't wanna talk with me.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.860
The place...

20:36.277 --> 20:38.008
I was born...

20:39.108 --> 20:41.494
is far away
from here.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.473
A poor village, deep in mountains,

20:47.738 --> 20:49.674
where life is tough.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.396
My dadda
had a bad lung

21:09.396 --> 21:12.495
and spent most of his
time laid up in bed.

21:12.695 --> 21:14.926
You'll be all right!

21:29.720 --> 21:32.652
My mama was a midwife.

21:32.652 --> 21:34.416
It is a boy.

21:34.316 --> 21:36.249
Delivering babies in the village

21:36.349 --> 21:39.282
when she wasn't tending
to my dadda.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.177
When I came along,

21:48.277 --> 21:51.609
their lives got
even more difficult.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.375
But they were happy
all the same.

22:05.569 --> 22:07.901
None of the other kids
would play with me

22:08.001 --> 22:09.500
because of my face.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.869
I was all by myself.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.411
Everyone in town detested me.

22:17.596 --> 22:19.697
But a Buddhist priest

22:19.797 --> 22:21.860
showed me kindness.

22:22.060 --> 22:24.488
Pretty scary, huh?

22:34.156 --> 22:37.040
These drawings were
made with real blood.

22:40.553 --> 22:42.218
Listen to me now.

22:46.216 --> 22:47.960
If you do bad things,

22:48.916 --> 22:50.515
you go straight to...

22:50.615 --> 22:51.748
Hell.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.312
If you want to go to Heaven,

22:57.145 --> 22:59.080
you must do all good things.

23:24.233 --> 23:27.766
He didn't want to cause us
any more trouble.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.129
Dadda died in the river.

23:31.462 --> 23:32.629
No...

23:34.028 --> 23:35.195
No!

23:38.459 --> 23:41.492
My mama tried her best.
Mama!

23:41.592 --> 23:43.623
But couldn't make a living
with a child around.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.456
You're coming
with me!

23:46.556 --> 23:50.488
You'll be happy!
I promise!

23:50.588 --> 23:53.419
Always keep your
chin up!

23:53.519 --> 23:55.219
Good luck!

24:06.447 --> 24:11.045
From here, it's the same old story.

24:11.145 --> 24:14.310
I was bought and sold
from place to place

24:14.410 --> 24:17.374
and finally wound up
on this island.

24:21.174 --> 24:25.405
Being a daughter of joy
is a living hell.

24:25.405 --> 24:29.237
This place is something out of
the pictures I saw at the temple.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.167
The pictures drawn in blood.

24:33.267 --> 24:35.733
Don't show me your face!

24:35.833 --> 24:37.333
- You slut!
- Oh!

24:56.391 --> 24:57.390
It's delicious, Madam.

24:57.391 --> 24:59.487
- Thank you.
- Hey, you!

24:59.587 --> 25:01.953
Until you get a man in here,

25:02.053 --> 25:03.951
you don't get fed.

25:04.051 --> 25:06.783
All your parts are there and working!

25:06.883 --> 25:09.080
If you can't get them
with your looks,

25:09.180 --> 25:11.944
make them happy
with something else!

25:12.844 --> 25:16.042
If you don't wanna
starve, get busy!

25:16.142 --> 25:17.540
You make that pussy pay!

25:30.430 --> 25:31.662
Please?

25:38.492 --> 25:42.721
But only Komomo,
she was kind to me.

25:42.821 --> 25:44.919
She had a heart of gold.

25:47.417 --> 25:51.747
I wasn't sold into
this like other girls.

25:52.047 --> 25:54.478
I have a man who loves me.

25:54.578 --> 25:58.741
I'm waiting for him to come for me.

25:58.941 --> 26:02.140
He promised to take me
away from here.

26:04.004 --> 26:06.701
And I'm the Empress of Japan.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.001
Komomo.

26:10.432 --> 26:12.430
You a fool.

26:12.430 --> 26:16.229
Your foster parents sold
you to cover their debts.

26:16.329 --> 26:19.491
No! My family's wealthy!

26:19.691 --> 26:22.190
If I was born in
another age,

26:22.290 --> 26:24.221
I would be a princess.

26:25.255 --> 26:28.119
What are you doing here, your highness?

26:28.319 --> 26:29.550
Face it, Komomo.

26:29.650 --> 26:32.015
You're a whore, just like
the rest of us.

26:32.115 --> 26:33.215
No.

26:33.315 --> 26:34.380
No, no.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.346
I'm no whore!

26:36.446 --> 26:39.010
Well, what kind of a princess

26:39.110 --> 26:41.208
spreads her legs every night

26:41.308 --> 26:42.973
for a few coins?

26:43.073 --> 26:44.306
They know about you.

26:44.406 --> 26:47.536
You're the only survivor
in a family suicide.

26:47.636 --> 26:50.900
Your money-grubbing foster
parents told the madam so.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.665
No. No!

26:52.765 --> 26:54.698
My family's wealthy!

26:54.798 --> 26:57.329
- Shut up, Komomo...
- Wake up. Stop it.

26:59.294 --> 27:02.324
If that's what Komomo
thinks, then let it be.

27:03.326 --> 27:05.622
Shut up.

27:05.722 --> 27:06.754
Freak.

27:12.917 --> 27:15.281
Maybe I'm a freak.

27:15.381 --> 27:18.613
But I'm a better woman than you are.

27:20.144 --> 27:23.510
Shall I make your face look like mine?

27:26.905 --> 27:30.236
Komomo was the most
popular with the men.

27:30.236 --> 27:33.900
She was so sweet and beautiful.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.731
The older women were jealous,
and always out to get her,

27:37.831 --> 27:39.896
one way or another.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.761
My ring is gone.

27:45.357 --> 27:46.357
My jade ring!

27:47.789 --> 27:49.787
Someone stole my ring!

27:51.020 --> 27:52.053
Who took it?

27:54.118 --> 27:57.547
I found this on the floor

27:57.647 --> 27:58.881
in my room.

28:05.109 --> 28:06.807
That's Komomo's.

28:08.206 --> 28:10.906
You always said
you wanted that ring.

28:11.006 --> 28:14.434
- Right, Komomo?
- Yes, she did. Right?

28:14.534 --> 28:16.034
Yeah, yeah...

28:16.034 --> 28:20.064
Stop your lies.  I never
heard anything like that.

28:20.264 --> 28:22.627
Komomo?
Is this yours?

28:23.628 --> 28:24.659
I don't know how this...

28:24.759 --> 28:26.927
Why was it in my room?

28:27.027 --> 28:28.258
I don't know.

28:28.258 --> 28:32.453
That ring is far more
valuable than your skin.

28:32.553 --> 28:33.953
I didn't steal it!

28:34.053 --> 28:35.353
We shall see.

28:35.453 --> 28:37.017
Take her out to the linen closet.

28:37.117 --> 28:39.516
- Come on, come on.
- No! No!

28:39.616 --> 28:41.512
Stop it!  Komomo
isn't that kind of a girl!

28:41.612 --> 28:43.547
Silence!

28:54.037 --> 28:56.236
Stay still!

29:01.098 --> 29:02.366
Don't touch her face.

29:03.396 --> 29:04.629
Only the body.

29:05.495 --> 29:07.093
But no real noticeable.

29:07.193 --> 29:08.193
Shut up!

29:08.193 --> 29:10.423
Don't leave marks!

29:10.523 --> 29:12.789
She's valuable merchandise,

29:12.889 --> 29:14.022
and my property.

29:17.452 --> 29:21.482
No! No! No! No! No!

29:24.581 --> 29:27.212
No! No!

29:36.038 --> 29:37.304
Hip! Hip!

30:15.406 --> 30:17.540
Hip! Hip! Hip!

30:27.830 --> 30:29.363
Perfect.

30:29.363 --> 30:31.060
Princess.

33:38.815 --> 33:41.179
It was me.

33:45.808 --> 33:49.039
I took it.

33:49.139 --> 33:53.169
Where is my ring?

33:53.169 --> 33:57.667
I don't remember.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.263
Please don't kill me.

34:03.328 --> 34:05.693
It hurts.

34:10.655 --> 34:13.023
Stubborn little cunt.

34:30.841 --> 34:35.569
In the end, they
never found the ring.

34:35.668 --> 34:38.333
No matter how hard
they beat her,

34:38.333 --> 34:40.199
she never talked.

34:52.989 --> 34:57.553
I waited and waited
for you, Christopher.

34:59.352 --> 35:01.983
Komomo,
I brought some wat--

35:13.172 --> 35:14.838
You're a liar!

35:20.268 --> 35:24.065
My Komomo would never
have done that.

35:26.663 --> 35:29.925
She hung herself.

35:30.825 --> 35:33.090
She's dead.

35:33.190 --> 35:38.155
I understand...
that nothing you say,

35:38.255 --> 35:40.985
nothing I do will
bring her back to me,

35:41.085 --> 35:44.742
but I need to know the truth!

35:51.376 --> 35:53.643
Of course you do.

35:53.843 --> 35:56.779
Whores never
tell the truth, do we?

35:58.337 --> 36:01.035
Please tell me the truth.

36:07.865 --> 36:13.796
I wonder why people always
want to know the truth.

36:14.858 --> 36:18.656
Sometimes it's better
not to know.

36:18.856 --> 36:22.753
Sometimes the lie is better.

36:22.853 --> 36:23.952
Oh, no, no.

36:24.052 --> 36:27.315
Please, please,
I'm begging you.

36:27.515 --> 36:30.480
Please, I need to know
what happened!

36:39.540 --> 36:42.670
Do you...

36:43.470 --> 36:45.033
really want to know?

36:45.133 --> 36:46.735
Ah hah.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.705
Huh?

37:23.705 --> 37:25.470
Where is it?

37:25.470 --> 37:27.435
Damn it!
Damn it!

37:30.867 --> 37:34.230
Excuse me, Madam.

37:34.530 --> 37:35.895
What?

37:40.192 --> 37:44.689
Do you know something?

37:44.689 --> 37:48.452
When I was
cleaning up earlier,

37:48.552 --> 37:51.150
I found this in the corner.

38:08.204 --> 38:12.648
Komomo,
I've brought some water.

38:17.364 --> 38:18.995
Komomo.

38:24.890 --> 38:27.121
I brought some water.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.654
Water.

38:43.875 --> 38:45.641
Thank you.

39:00.396 --> 39:04.627
I can stand any kind
of cruelty,

39:04.727 --> 39:08.822
but what I can't take
is... kindness.

39:11.221 --> 39:14.051
Maybe she wasn't a whore,

39:14.151 --> 39:17.947
but a woman
with a lovely heart.

39:18.047 --> 39:21.613
Even though her body was in Hell,

39:21.713 --> 39:25.451
her mind was in Heaven.

39:26.242 --> 39:29.406
Her soul wanted
to be there--

39:29.506 --> 39:34.704
needed to be, Mister.

39:35.736 --> 39:41.463
Her eyes were the most
beautiful I'd ever seen.

39:41.563 --> 39:47.124
So... that's the truth.
You killed her.

39:48.224 --> 39:53.587
You took a woman who was
so innocent, she was like a child,

39:53.687 --> 39:56.950
never hurt a single person,

39:57.050 --> 40:00.316
and then you killed her for a...

40:00.416 --> 40:03.047
a trinket that you wanted.

40:03.147 --> 40:06.711
That's why you killed my Komomo.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.939
You don't understand.
I helped her get to Heaven.

40:14.738 --> 40:18.134
I have never
decided one thing,

40:18.234 --> 40:23.030
not a single thing,
by myself until then.

40:23.230 --> 40:26.896
For the first time,
I took action by myself

40:26.996 --> 40:29.326
and I'm going to Hell for it.

40:29.426 --> 40:34.222
Oh, God,
I'm surrounded by madness.

40:34.522 --> 40:37.186
Suppose I'm right, though.

40:37.386 --> 40:41.916
What would the Devil think of her
having such an evil friend?

40:42.216 --> 40:44.481
He'd think if they're friends,

40:44.581 --> 40:47.146
then Komomo must be
a wicked person, too.

40:47.246 --> 40:48.978
He would've sent
her to Hell.

40:49.078 --> 40:52.076
So I aided Komomo.

40:53.076 --> 40:58.087
Now I'm sure
she's in Heaven.

40:59.526 --> 41:04.117
What could be more pitiful
to be strangled to death

41:04.217 --> 41:07.055
by the one you trusted most?

41:08.196 --> 41:12.688
I'm sure Buddha
grabbed her by the hand

41:12.688 --> 41:15.518
and took her to Heaven.

41:15.518 --> 41:18.514
Right, Sis?

41:56.766 --> 41:58.930
You're leaving
something out.

41:59.030 --> 42:01.021
You're not telling
me something!

42:01.190 --> 42:02.821
What is it?

42:03.587 --> 42:06.845
Oh, tell me!

42:06.849 --> 42:08.179
What are you hiding?

42:14.533 --> 42:16.898
Tell him the truth.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.901
Tell him the truth.

42:31.802 --> 42:33.002
No!

42:33.934 --> 42:35.330
No!

42:45.547 --> 42:47.769
You want to know.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.423
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

42:51.201 --> 42:53.326
I don't want to know!

42:54.764 --> 42:58.229
I need to know!

43:02.284 --> 43:04.829
Then I shall--

43:05.909 --> 43:10.117
I will tell you my story.

43:19.472 --> 43:22.456
My dadda and mama
were beggars.

43:22.792 --> 43:24.986
They called no place home.

43:27.846 --> 43:30.209
Wandering from
place to place,

43:30.309 --> 43:34.131
they ended up in the poorest
village in the region.

43:34.232 --> 43:36.025
Compared to that place,

43:36.026 --> 43:39.286
this rotten island
is paradise.

44:03.925 --> 44:06.087
Mama wasn't the midwife.

44:06.187 --> 44:07.882
She worked with babies,

44:07.982 --> 44:09.945
but she was more of
a specialist.

44:10.045 --> 44:13.369
I'm sure you have the same
practice in America, right?

44:22.445 --> 44:25.969
Ah, more sake.

44:26.269 --> 44:28.064
With what money?

44:28.164 --> 44:29.561
More sake.

44:29.661 --> 44:32.555
With what money?

44:32.655 --> 44:34.217
Sake.

44:40.867 --> 44:43.287
No, no!
Look at me.

44:43.161 --> 44:44.957
Aah!

44:48.216 --> 44:50.497
No, stop!
No!

44:57.592 --> 45:00.786
Okay!  No, no!

45:00.985 --> 45:03.644
No! Oh!

45:03.744 --> 45:04.875
Aah!

45:04.975 --> 45:06.171
Sake.

45:11.590 --> 45:14.284
Sake.

45:14.984 --> 45:18.041
Despite his cruelty
and drinking,

45:18.141 --> 45:20.770
Mama did her duties
as a good wife.

45:20.870 --> 45:23.625
She soon got pregnant with me.

46:20.021 --> 46:22.350
You asked for the truth.

46:22.450 --> 46:29.019
Yes, I was dumped in the
river and left to die, too.

46:35.318 --> 46:40.804
But two days later, I was
still alive and kicking.

46:43.001 --> 46:46.292
Mama made up her mind
to raise me.

47:05.943 --> 47:08.768
As long as I can remember,

47:08.868 --> 47:11.962
I helped Mama with her work.

47:24.097 --> 47:25.127
Unh!

48:11.016 --> 48:13.343
Dump this.

48:13.343 --> 48:19.693
That hole is the one
that leads to Hell.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.751
Pretty scary, huh?

48:29.004 --> 48:32.994
If you don't do as I say,

48:33.094 --> 48:36.340
you will go
straight to Hell.

48:44.132 --> 48:50.843
And so this hole
leads to Hell, too.

48:50.878 --> 48:52.280
Freak!

48:53.578 --> 48:55.863
Baby killer!

48:55.898 --> 48:56.997
Beggar!

48:57.032 --> 48:58.214
Freak!

48:58.249 --> 49:00.378
Freak! Freak! Freak!

49:00.413 --> 49:02.413
Go away,
you little brats!

49:27.263 --> 49:30.599
No! No! No! No!

49:32.382 --> 49:33.480
No! No!

49:33.580 --> 49:35.672
Stop!  Stop it!

49:39.728 --> 49:41.745
Aah! Stop!

49:41.780 --> 49:42.501
Go on!

49:42.536 --> 49:43.555
No!

49:43.555 --> 49:45.865
Oh! No!

51:40.465 --> 51:42.431
Stop this!

52:01.338 --> 52:03.247
No, Sis.

52:05.296 --> 52:06.363
Aah!

52:58.756 --> 53:00.419
Sis!

53:00.419 --> 53:03.886
Stop it, Sis.

53:04.586 --> 53:05.754
Bitch!

53:07.154 --> 53:10.004
My twin.

53:12.252 --> 53:14.929
Have I got your attention, Mister?

53:16.484 --> 53:20.708
Yes, I'm a twin

53:21.683 --> 53:24.082
and this is my sister.

53:30.950 --> 53:35.147
Nobody ever knew
about my sister.

53:35.347 --> 53:36.248
Nobody...

53:36.348 --> 53:37.915
Aah!

53:38.115 --> 53:39.514
...except Mama.

53:39.614 --> 53:40.213
Aah!

53:40.313 --> 53:43.658
Oh, she knew.

53:43.693 --> 53:44.929
Aah!

53:49.359 --> 53:50.633
No!

53:50.745 --> 53:52.385
Stop it, Brother!

53:52.984 --> 53:54.077
Unh!

53:54.679 --> 53:57.605
It turned out
that Mama and Dada

53:57.705 --> 54:00.220
were brother and sister.

54:00.226 --> 54:00.996
Sake.

54:01.097 --> 54:05.288
People found out and
ran them out of town.

54:05.490 --> 54:08.415
While begging their way
across the country,

54:08.746 --> 54:11.105
they escaped to this place.

54:11.439 --> 54:14.169
My sister and I were cursed

54:14.269 --> 54:16.728
long before
coming into this world.

Die! Die!

55:34.883 --> 55:35.985
Die!

55:35.985 --> 55:37.318
I want it.

55:37.318 --> 55:39.618
I want it!
I want it!

55:40.981 --> 55:42.818
Give it to me.

55:42.918 --> 55:45.553
I can't. I can't.

55:49.714 --> 55:53.948
My sister always loved
pretty, shiny things.

55:54.048 --> 55:56.114
I couldn't fight her.

55:56.214 --> 55:59.447
When she wanted something,
she always got it,

55:59.547 --> 56:01.213
no matter what.

56:06.913 --> 56:12.511
But I was the one
who decided to kill Komomo.

56:13.411 --> 56:17.181
All my sister wanted
was the ring.

56:17.581 --> 56:22.650
Either way, we're stuck
with each other,

56:23.077 --> 56:25.673
and we're both going to Hell,

56:26.076 --> 56:27.649
right, Sis?

56:27.684 --> 56:32.146
"I've waited and waited
for you, Christopher."

56:32.346 --> 56:34.048
Komomo?

56:34.743 --> 56:38.619
"Yes, your Komomo."

56:38.654 --> 56:39.941
Oh.

56:39.941 --> 56:43.917
Oh, I should never have come here.
This place...

56:44.439 --> 56:49.917
This place is truly
a damned place!

56:49.952 --> 56:53.541
No matter where you go,
your hell follows you.

56:53.641 --> 56:57.106
I know what you did
back in America.

57:01.106 --> 57:02.604
"You're hurting me!

57:02.704 --> 57:04.105
"Stop it, Christopher!

57:04.205 --> 57:05.800
"Why did you kill me?

57:05.805 --> 57:08.672
"Why would you hurt me,
your own little sister?

57:08.772 --> 57:10.106
"I did what you asked.

57:10.206 --> 57:11.571
Why?"

57:12.970 --> 57:15.702
You freak.
You freak!

57:15.802 --> 57:17.736
Freak! Freak!

57:20.138 --> 57:23.900
Okay, you win.

57:27.302 --> 57:31.233
I'll give you
what you want.

57:31.633 --> 57:36.738
I'm going send you both...
to Hell!

57:40.965 --> 57:43.165
You can't do it.

58:04.730 --> 58:07.499
You cannot kill us.

59:09.786 --> 59:13.370
I waited for you.

59:26.586 --> 59:30.168
Jesus, get a whiff
of that guy.

59:30.251 --> 59:31.851
He's a murderer.

59:31.951 --> 59:34.654
He's that American
newspaperman

59:34.754 --> 59:36.317
who killed that whore.

59:36.417 --> 59:37.752
Yeah.

59:37.852 --> 59:42.150
Hey, listen, we are going to
have some fun with you.

59:42.250 --> 59:44.817
And death won't come soon.

59:44.917 --> 59:46.683
This will be a living hell.
