Tim, are you OK?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.639
- Where was John?
- You know where John is.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.439
At our dinner party
with the girls -

01:20.440 --> 01:21.999
was he opposite or beside me?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.079
Er, does it matter?

01:24.080 --> 01:27.080
I'm trying to write itdown,
and I...

01:29.600 --> 01:31.319
There were mint leaves
in our drink,

01:31.320 --> 01:33.039
I remember the colour
of your dress,

01:33.040 --> 01:35.039

05:26.600 --> 05:28.479
Sweet flower,

05:28.480 --> 05:31.480
with flowers thy bridal bed
I strew.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.879
O, woe!

05:35.880 --> 05:38.239
Thy canopy is
but dust and stones,

05:38.240 --> 05:41.240
which with sweet water
nightly will I dew.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.799
Can't you do it sadder?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.800
You're Paris. She's Juliet.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.040
You've lost your fiancÃ©e,
not your bus pass.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.840
Or wanting that,
with tears distilled...

05:59.080 --> 06:02.080
No, stop. Stop.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.280
Can you imagine
what it would be like

06:06.360 --> 06:09.360
to, say, lose your girlfriend.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.239
I guess so, sir.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.240
It'd be tremendously sad,
wouldn't it?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.039
What's her name?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.879
I don't have a girlfriend,
sir.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.880
BOY: Yeah, wonder why!
(Laughter)

06:23.880 --> 06:26.880
Here, lying in her tomb, eh?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.120
Cold. The colour -
colour's gone from her face!

06:31.160 --> 06:32.719

Yeah, I really wanna think
about that now, don't I?

I'm in a play with
your brother, actually -

08:35.640 --> 08:37.519
Romeo And Juliet.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.078
Are you Romeo?

08:39.080 --> 08:42.078
Mmm, the competition.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.080
Paris - the one Juliet leaves
for Romeo.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.759
Poor Paris.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.760

09:52.800 --> 09:54.839
BOY 1: Why is everyone
saying 'break a leg'?

09:54.840 --> 09:57.199
BOY 2: Because you're not
meant to say 'good luck'.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.879
BOY 1: You just said it.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.880

- Is your brother in?

10:10.480 --> 10:13.480
- I'm in his geography class.
PAUL: So?

10:18.600 --> 10:21.600
OK, and remember,
if anyone laughs at you,

10:22.200 --> 10:25.200
it's because they haven't
the guts to do it themselves.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.079
Break a leg.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.279
- Cue overture, Chris.

- What's up with you?
- No, just...

11:45.760 --> 11:48.199
Probably morning sickness.
Maybe you're pregnant.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.279
No, Doc,
I think I'd know if I was.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.119

Conigrave's pregnant!

11:53.120 --> 11:54.879
You told me
you were on the pill.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.959
- You guys are suss!
- I hope you're not angry.

I'll get rid of it
if you want!

Doctor, I'd like an abortion.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.559
That's against...

Hey, do you want me to...
I can...

So, what do you reckon,
this dinner?

difficult.

a lift home.

So, what did you think
ofthe play?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.799
I didn't see it.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.999
- We were fabulous!
(Laughter)

13:28.000 --> 13:30.079
I should have worked harder
to make you come.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.080
(Girls laugh)

13:33.320 --> 13:36.320
- Is there a problem?
(Girls laugh)

13:46.600 --> 13:48.519
We're a new group offriends,

13:48.520 --> 13:51.520
so I think we should send
a kiss around the table.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.639
- What? No. No.
GIRL: Oh, yes.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.559
- Yes, let's.
TIM: Absolutely not.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.560
I'll go first.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.560

to the divine life of grace.

ALL: Lord, hear our prayer.

You have to drop him,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.160
Derge needs
to know he's special.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.039
Hurry, please.
I've got dinner on.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.959
Tell your friends
not to call at dinnertime!

18:01.960 --> 18:04.960
- I can call back.
TIM: What? Why?

18:05.120 --> 18:06.679
Your dinner.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.680
No, it's... it's OK.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.200
- We're having casserole.
- Chops.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.519
We just had chops
and mashed potato.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.079
And peas.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.080
I like you.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.879
That's good.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.880
I reallylike you.
I've likedyou forsome time.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.320
I like you too.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.279
Does this mean
that we're going out?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.280
(Laughs)
You haven'tasked me yet.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.240
John Caleo,
will you go round with me?

18:57.640 --> 19:00.039
- Yep.
- Oh!

19:00.040 --> 19:02.239
DRAGON: * Sun and the sea

19:02.240 --> 19:05.240
* Birds in the air

19:07.320 --> 19:10.320
* I lostmylove

19:11.800 --> 19:14.800
* Oh, no

19:16.080 --> 19:19.080
* Oh, no... *

19:28.000 --> 19:29.479
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

19:29.480 --> 19:31.239
* This time,
I'm gonna take yourhand

19:31.240 --> 19:34.240
* Gonna take you

19:34.560 --> 19:37.560

20:06.720 --> 20:09.720
* In the rightdirection
In the rightdirection... *

20:36.560 --> 20:38.559
No-one can see.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.559
I better get home.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.560
Ah! God! So turned on.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.880
(Laughs) I'll have to go
straight home and pull myself.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.480
You don't do that, do you?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.759
- You joking?
- Why do you need to?

20:54.760 --> 20:57.760
Because it's fun!

20:58.240 --> 21:01.240
Can you see if you can stop?

21:02.480 --> 21:04.039
Mmm.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.959
Have you seen my Cleo
magazine?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.960
No.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.400
(Moans softly)

22:17.600 --> 22:20.600
(Moans softly)

22:39.400 --> 22:42.400
(Moans softly)

22:53.360 --> 22:56.360
(Breathes heavily)

23:01.040 --> 23:04.039
TIM: DearJohn.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.040
It's 1am and I can'tsleep.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.439
I think I went
too fartoo soon

23:09.440 --> 23:12.440
when I reached
into yourdaks.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
All I can sayis I'm sorry.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.080
thatis enough forme.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.599
THE MASTER'S APPRENTICES:
* It's because I love you... *

23:32.600 --> 23:34.439
- What's this?
- Give it back.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.639
- A love letter!
- Eric, give it back to him.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.199
TEACHER:
Quieten down, you lot,

23:38.200 --> 23:40.639
and that includes the peanut
gallery at the back.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.519
- Thank you.
- Give it back!

23:42.520 --> 23:45.520
TEACHER: Now, will you all
please open your books

23:46.040 --> 23:48.919
to page 97...

23:48.920 --> 23:50.479
TIM: Idiot!

23:50.480 --> 23:53.480
TEACHER: We are now going
to further investigate...

23:55.120 --> 23:58.120
.. the topological formation
of our own continent.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.599
There are, as you know,

24:01.600 --> 24:04.600
14 major tectonic plates.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.279
If you don't know
them already,

24:10.280 --> 24:12.959
write them down,
because you need to know them.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.759
They are of course,
first, the Eurasian plate,

24:15.760 --> 24:18.760
two, Australian-Indian,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
three, Philippines,
four, Pacific,

24:22.320 --> 24:25.320
five, Juan de Fuca...

24:25.640 --> 24:28.640
I expected more of you, Caleo.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.440
Six, Nazca,
seven, Cocos.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.399
TIM: We love each other. What
are you going to do about it?

24:40.400 --> 24:42.079
JOHN: Tim!

24:42.080 --> 24:43.639
You're mumbling, Tim.

24:43.640 --> 24:44.919
We love each other

24:44.920 --> 24:47.399
and what are you
going to do about it?

24:47.400 --> 24:50.400
Father, please!
This can't get around.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.359
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.360
There are people in this place
that want to discipline you.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.559
You're quite the topic of
conversation in the staffroom.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.559
Why haven't
they tried to stop us?

25:05.560 --> 25:08.559
The lay staffwould like to...

25:08.560 --> 25:10.439
.. but the Jesuits
look out for you.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.279
We've seen this before.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.799
- (Scoffs)
- Be careful, Tim.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.559
Yes, Father.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.119
Not everything
has to be political.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.999
Doesn't it?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.839
Tim, there will be
other battles,

25:24.840 --> 25:27.840
and they will need
educated people to fight them.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.720
Don't jeopardise your
schooling over this, boys.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.320
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, thy gifts

25:39.720 --> 25:42.720
we are about to receive
from thy bounty.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.919
Through Christ, our Lord,
amen.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.920
ALL: Amen.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.559
Tim?

25:52.560 --> 25:54.959
Thank you, Mrs Caleo.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.960
Lovely manners.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.959
BOB: What about you?
Do you want an onion?

26:01.960 --> 26:04.319
There you go.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.879
What about you?

26:05.880 --> 26:08.880
TIM: No, I'm right
at the moment.

26:09.240 --> 26:12.119
- It's really good, Mum.
- That's really nice, Mum.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.120
MOTHER: Is it, darling?

26:18.480 --> 26:21.480
John, er... John's changed.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.560
We've all noticed.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.440
Ever since he's been
hanging around with you.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.640
He's come out of himself.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.599
Lois and I are very grateful.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.600
We'd like to thank you.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.600
He's a great guy.

27:00.440 --> 27:03.440
Mum's rule - friends sleep
in here on a school night,

27:03.520 --> 27:05.759
otherwise I stay up yakking.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.760
(Laughs) I don't mind.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.519
You reckon your parents will
let you come away to Eric's

27:21.520 --> 27:23.079
for the study break?

27:23.080 --> 27:25.799
They said as long
as you're going.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.800
Five fellas in a shack. You
never know what might happen.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.920
(Floorboard creaks)

27:43.960 --> 27:45.519
(Sweet flower...)

27:45.520 --> 27:48.520
- (Gasps)
- Shh!

27:48.680 --> 27:51.680
(Both laugh)

28:01.200 --> 28:04.200
(Sleeping bag unzips)

29:02.120 --> 29:05.120
(John breathes heavily)

29:09.280 --> 29:12.280
(John moans)
- Shh, shh.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
- Oh!
- Shh, shh.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.760
- (Can we go again?)
- (Laughs)

29:40.200 --> 29:43.200
(Birds chirp)

29:54.520 --> 29:56.719
I feel like
I played a grand final.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.720
(Laughs)

30:09.440 --> 30:12.440
(Floorboard creaks)

30:36.560 --> 30:38.279
We'll be back with lunch.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.280
Good luck!

30:45.600 --> 30:47.239
TIM: What are you doing?

30:47.240 --> 30:50.240
Just felt like it.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.080
(Both moan)

31:38.960 --> 31:41.960
TIM: DearJohn.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.119
I think I wenttoo far
too soon

31:44.120 --> 31:45.879
when I reachedinto yourdaks.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.880
BOY: Dad? Did Paul get
an extra two bucks?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.639
I'm the one
who cleaned the gutters.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.319
Out!

31:54.320 --> 31:57.320
DERGE: What the fu...
Are you fucking kidding?!

32:03.440 --> 32:06.440
BOY: Thanks.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.439
ERIC: Ought to run into town
for more beer.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.440
DERGE: Too frigging cold.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.599
Good streaking weather.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.319
Piss off, I'm not doing that.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.239
What? You have before.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.079
Leave it, Biscuit.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.439
No, why not?

32:35.440 --> 32:38.440
Fuck off, Conigrave.
Just fuck off.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.760
Fucking homo.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.840
(Laughter)

32:53.040 --> 32:56.040
Yes!

32:56.400 --> 32:59.400
(Laughter)

33:05.000 --> 33:07.239
Oh, Dergey boy!

33:07.240 --> 33:10.240
(Laughter)

33:15.520 --> 33:17.639
(Laughter)

33:17.640 --> 33:20.640
(All whoop)

33:22.800 --> 33:25.359
(Car horn honks)
- Lovely night for it!

33:25.360 --> 33:28.360
(Laughs) Run like
the clappers, boys.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.640
(Car horn honks)

33:32.360 --> 33:35.360
I'm doing it, but don't you
two look at my arse!

33:35.920 --> 33:38.199
(Laughter)

33:38.200 --> 33:41.200
Come on, Derge!

33:46.200 --> 33:49.200
Hello.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.759
Has someone died?

33:58.760 --> 34:01.760
I told myself
I was being stupid.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.479
What?

34:05.480 --> 34:08.480
FATHER: John's father
came to see me today.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.960
He made me read your letter.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.760
What letter?

34:16.360 --> 34:17.918
Tim, when I was your age

34:17.920 --> 34:20.438
guys used to muck around in
the showers at the yacht club

34:20.440 --> 34:22.279
while their parents
were up in the bar.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.280
Everyone did it.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.279
You're gonna grow out ofthis.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.599
I hope you do,

34:28.600 --> 34:31.600
otherwise you're going
to have a very lonely life.

34:32.159 --> 34:35.159
A very sad life.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.478
Up until now,
I couldn't be happier.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.359
Don't be smart!
You're living under our roof.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.360
Your mother and I have made
a decision.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.559
You and John can't see each
other anymore.

34:50.560 --> 34:53.039
Yes, we can.
You can't stop us.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.040
The man is threatening
court action.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.039
And do you support him?

35:01.040 --> 35:03.119
FATHER: What you're doing
is illegal.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.079
Do you support him?

35:05.080 --> 35:06.639
No, frankly, we don't,

35:06.640 --> 35:09.519
but today has been the most
humiliating day of my life!

35:09.520 --> 35:12.520
John won't be
staying here anymore,

35:12.640 --> 35:15.119
and you're not to use
the telephone to contact him.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.120
You fucking poxy traitors!
I hope you get cancer!

35:21.640 --> 35:24.640
Wow.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.799
They all call you
the school poofter!

35:27.800 --> 35:30.119
I stuck up for you,
and then I find out it's true!

35:30.120 --> 35:31.679
(Door slams)

35:31.680 --> 35:34.680
* BRONSKl BEAT: I Feel Love

35:44.600 --> 35:47.600
* You

35:50.360 --> 35:53.360
* You and me, yeah!

35:57.760 --> 36:00.760
* Ooh, I'm in love,
I'm in love

36:03.360 --> 36:06.360
* I'm in love

36:10.080 --> 36:13.080
* I feel love

36:16.640 --> 36:19.640
* I feel love

36:23.160 --> 36:26.160
* I feel love

36:29.880 --> 36:32.519
* I feel love... *

36:32.520 --> 36:35.520
(Tapping at window)

36:39.480 --> 36:42.480
What are you doing here?

36:53.120 --> 36:55.239
Mmm. You taste like fly spray.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.240
(Laughs) Yeah.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.399
(John cries)

37:03.400 --> 37:06.400
- We'll get through this.
- How?

37:07.800 --> 37:10.079
- They'll keep us apart.
- Will you marry me?

37:10.080 --> 37:12.239
Oh!

37:12.240 --> 37:14.559
(Both laugh)

37:14.560 --> 37:16.239
- That just fell out.
- (Laughs)

37:16.240 --> 37:19.240
FATHER: John?

37:29.040 --> 37:30.919
Homework all done?

37:30.920 --> 37:33.920
Pretty much.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.080
(Sighs) Your mother's
very upset.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.640
I talked to the parish priest.
He recommended a psychologist.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.119
Your mother will make
an appointment

37:53.120 --> 37:56.120
and then you will see
this man.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.640
John, you've got to put this
in the past.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.719
Exams soon,

38:08.720 --> 38:11.720
so it ought to be easy
for you to avoid Tim.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.320
I love you.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.960
* I feel love

38:55.760 --> 38:58.760
* I feel love

39:02.360 --> 39:05.360
* I feel love

39:08.840 --> 39:11.840
* I feel love... *

39:16.120 --> 39:17.839
TIM: You don't mind
if I record this?

39:17.840 --> 39:20.719
MAN: What year were you born?
TIM: Pardon?

39:20.720 --> 39:22.279
MAN: Your birth year.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.839
Oh, 1959. October.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.840
MAN: Ah.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.040
Year ofthe Pig.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.079
Little sandalwood
always helps.

39:40.080 --> 39:43.080
So, it's OK...
I'm taping this?

39:45.240 --> 39:47.799
Sit. You're making me nervous.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.800
(Coughs uncontrollably)

39:55.880 --> 39:57.679
So, we're devising
a theatre piece -

39:57.680 --> 40:00.519
the actors,
and me as the writer.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.520
We've all graduated
drama school. You know NIDA?

40:03.600 --> 40:05.279
I know Narnia.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.239
No, not that.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.159
Erm, we agreed
to interview people

40:09.160 --> 40:12.160
because we felt the issue has
been hijacked by the media -

40:12.200 --> 40:14.639
all this
sex, death, horror shit.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.879
How long have
you been positive?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.559
Me? (Laughs) No, I'm not.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.439
And rather not know.

40:21.440 --> 40:24.440
Well, if you haven't been
exposed...

40:26.160 --> 40:29.160
How can you write this play?

40:29.200 --> 40:32.200
You're making assumptions
about your status.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.759
No, I'm in a stable
relationship.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.639
I think he's cheating on you.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.640
(Laughs) You don't know him.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.799
We've been together
since high school.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.239
What - constantly?

40:48.240 --> 40:50.679
(Laughs) That doesn't happen.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.680
Just... going to check...

40:57.560 --> 40:59.599
.. see ifthat's working.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.319
(Tape whirrs)

41:01.320 --> 41:03.119
OK.

41:03.120 --> 41:06.120
So, perhaps just state
your name and age.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.920
Me?

41:14.240 --> 41:15.799
I'm Richard.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.800
I'm 33, and I have decided
I am going to make it to 34.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.920
What do you want to include
in your play?

41:33.200 --> 41:36.039
I've forgotten - were we
talking about a helicopter?

41:36.040 --> 41:37.839
- No.
(Fan whirrs)

41:37.840 --> 41:40.840
I mean, the kind of helicopter
that drops supplies.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.039
No.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.479
I get ticked off
that some people get

41:45.480 --> 41:48.480
this nice little boat ride,
you know?

41:49.320 --> 41:52.320
Instead I'm in the quicksand
with the snakes!

41:52.560 --> 41:54.639
I shouldn't have
to put up with it.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.640
TIM: OK.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.479
I mean, don't get me wrong,

42:00.480 --> 42:03.359
because most people have only
seen these things in a book

42:03.360 --> 42:06.360
or something like that.

42:08.240 --> 42:11.240
Like a leopard.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.680
The other night on the stairs,
I saw one for real.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.159
Where were you?

42:21.160 --> 42:24.160
In the Congo.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.800
Leopard was gonna have a baby.

42:31.240 --> 42:34.240
You think
I'm not making sense...

42:36.040 --> 42:38.919
.. but I am.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.479
(Telephone rings)

42:40.480 --> 42:43.480
RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you?

42:49.360 --> 42:51.079
(Negative, thank God.)

42:51.080 --> 42:52.959
You weren't worried, were you?

42:52.960 --> 42:55.960
Nah. Can you imagine
being told you've got it?

42:59.840 --> 43:01.439
Well, we don't.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.639
You want to go grab some lunch
after this?

43:03.640 --> 43:06.079
Some of us have real jobs.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.080
MAN: Tim, 2117?

43:12.320 --> 43:15.320
Look at us.
We're fast-lane gays.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.400
Tim?

43:45.920 --> 43:47.599
JOHN: What is it?

43:47.600 --> 43:50.600
Um... he said I'm positive,
John.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.960
But I'm negative.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.799
I should... I'll explain.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.800
The system here is that
if your result is negative,

44:06.840 --> 44:08.479
you see a counsellor,

44:08.480 --> 44:11.480
and if you're positive,
you see a doctor, like me.

44:11.680 --> 44:14.680
John, the clerk put your file
in the wrong pigeonhole,

44:16.240 --> 44:18.599
and the counsellor
gave you the result

44:18.600 --> 44:21.600
without checking the file.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.519
I'm sorry.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.599
You've been given
the wrong result.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.199
You're positive. You both are.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.839
I'd like to take some blood
from you both

44:30.840 --> 44:32.399
to do a cell count.

44:32.400 --> 44:35.400
I'm terribly...
I'm... truly so sorry.

44:36.560 --> 44:39.560
This should not happen. I...

44:42.160 --> 44:44.079
Can you not stretch my
T- shirt?

44:44.080 --> 44:47.080
I'm not!

44:48.440 --> 44:51.440
Do you think I infected you?

44:53.560 --> 44:56.560
You, with your high T8 counts.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.479
You're recently infected,

44:59.480 --> 45:02.480
that's what the doctor
was saying.

45:03.840 --> 45:06.840
We didn't know
this was lurking.

45:08.760 --> 45:11.760
It didn't have a name.

45:12.280 --> 45:15.280
It's not as though...

45:16.080 --> 45:19.080
I mean,
I've hardly been with...

45:21.080 --> 45:22.999
I got something.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.999
(Kisses)

45:25.000 --> 45:26.799
I couldn't decide between

45:26.800 --> 45:29.159
'ribbed for her pleasure'
or...

45:29.160 --> 45:30.719
We're not gonna fuck, Tim.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.720
That's how we got into this
mess in the first place.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.800
MAN: Most people have only
seen these things in a book

45:38.080 --> 45:40.999
or something like that.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
The other night on the stairs,
I saw one for real.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.519
In the Congo.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.520
The leopard was going
to have a baby.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.320
WOMAN: Richard had been
diagnosed with toxoplasmosis,

45:56.280 --> 45:59.280
a disease caused by a parasite
found in cat faeces.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.560
Are you telling me
I ate cat poo?

46:03.840 --> 46:06.679
Probably as a kid
playing in a sandpit.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.959
(Kisses) We all did, darling.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.960
We mistook it for a
consequence-free environment.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.359
We had hoped to interview
Richard again,

46:20.360 --> 46:23.199
but as he prepared
to welcome in 1986,

46:23.200 --> 46:25.119
Richard succumbed to dementia

46:25.120 --> 46:28.120
and a litany ofAIDS-related
illnesses.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.760
Just down the road from here,
at St Vincent's.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.439
TIM: Ifthere were thousands
of schoolkids dropping dead,

46:40.440 --> 46:41.999
they'd do something about it.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.359
God help you
if you're a poofter,

46:44.360 --> 46:46.439
or a junkie, or a prostitute!

46:46.440 --> 46:48.999
We're not like those people
in the play.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
It's not gonna get us.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.920
We're lucky.
We're the second wave.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.840
They're gonna cure it.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.759
JOHN: Are you ready?
TIM: Not really.

47:04.760 --> 47:07.760
Let's do it.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.999
Campus Gays.
Our bodies, our rights.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
Thank you.

47:41.840 --> 47:43.119
That was great.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.639
Yeah? You think that was good?

47:44.640 --> 47:45.919
Mm-hm.

47:45.920 --> 47:47.479
MAN: Two, four, six, eight!

47:47.480 --> 47:50.480
PROTESTORS: Gay love's
just as good as straight!

47:51.200 --> 47:53.599
- Two, four, six, eight!
- Gay love just as good...

47:53.600 --> 47:55.279
Two, four, six, eight!

47:55.280 --> 47:56.999
Gay love's just as good
as straight!

47:57.000 --> 47:58.559
Two, four, six, eight!

47:58.560 --> 48:00.279
Gay love's just as good
as straight!

48:00.280 --> 48:01.999
We are here
and no longer invisible!

48:02.000 --> 48:03.919
Monash University Lesbians.

48:03.920 --> 48:06.159
Tim and John!

48:06.160 --> 48:07.879
JOHN: No, no, no.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.839
It's not like we're lobbing
petrol bombs

48:09.840 --> 48:11.439
in the street, John.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.479
JOHN: Do you want
to come inside?

48:13.480 --> 48:15.359
Into your home?

48:15.360 --> 48:17.439
They're all down
at the beach house.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.440
Really? And what if your dad's
installed Tim detectors?

49:09.120 --> 49:10.799
I want you inside me.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.800
You wanna suck me?

49:14.200 --> 49:17.200
I wanna know
what it feels like.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.439
Don't you think
it's a bit... dirty?

49:22.440 --> 49:24.199
Oh, I sound so Catholic!

49:24.200 --> 49:26.119
- You are Catholic.
- You are!

49:26.120 --> 49:28.959
It's not an insult, Tim.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.960
Did this conversation
just stop being sexy?

49:34.040 --> 49:37.040
Please?

49:52.920 --> 49:55.920
(Car horn honks)

50:02.760 --> 50:05.760
LOIS: Come on, come on.
(Dog barks)

50:10.520 --> 50:12.639
- Get in the closet!
- Are you serious?

50:12.640 --> 50:15.640
In the closet.
Get in the cupboard!

50:17.280 --> 50:18.919
Wha...

50:18.920 --> 50:21.920
Uh...

50:27.760 --> 50:29.999
John? Will you help
your brother get...

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Mum, Tim's here.
Please don't tell Dad.

50:34.480 --> 50:37.480
You had jolly well better
get him out quick smart!

50:37.520 --> 50:40.520
Anthony?

50:41.720 --> 50:43.399
- Come on, we've gotta go.
- Eh?

50:43.400 --> 50:46.359
We've gotta go!

50:46.360 --> 50:49.360
Come on! Go!

50:51.520 --> 50:54.520
Not very happy about this.

50:58.040 --> 50:59.959
Do you mind?
It's starting to pong.

50:59.960 --> 51:02.799
- Whose car is that out front?
- Erm... er...

51:02.800 --> 51:05.800
John?

51:06.200 --> 51:09.200
Are you home?

51:11.120 --> 51:14.120
John!

51:25.200 --> 51:28.039
Whose car is that?

51:28.040 --> 51:31.040
Dad, Tim's here.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.119
Tell him to leave.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.120
I invited him.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.479
Now I'm going with him
in his car.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.399
No, you're not.

51:40.400 --> 51:43.400
Tim?

51:44.040 --> 51:47.040
Come in here.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.759
We love each other, Dad.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.999
There's nothing
you can do about it.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
LOIS: Don't you speak
to your father like that!

52:28.880 --> 52:31.119
Go. Drive.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.639
That was fan-fucking-tastic.

52:33.640 --> 52:36.640
(Engine starts)

52:44.600 --> 52:46.919
TIM: Arggh! I'm too cramped!
Maybe ifwe...

52:46.920 --> 52:48.479
JOHN: Ow, ow, my balls!

52:48.480 --> 52:50.359
(Tim laughs) Sorry, sorry!

52:50.360 --> 52:53.360
(Grunting)
TIM: I'll just...

52:58.560 --> 53:00.679
Ah, this is... There!

53:00.680 --> 53:03.680
JOHN: Oh, gentle!

53:06.080 --> 53:08.319
TIM: Can I go further in?
JOHN: Slowly.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.559
- Pardon?
- Slowly.

53:09.560 --> 53:10.919
Arggh! I said slowly!

53:10.920 --> 53:13.920
TIM: Oh. Well, it's gonna
snap off in a minute!

53:15.360 --> 53:17.679
JOHN: Oh! Oh!

53:17.680 --> 53:19.359
(Tim laughs)
- It's in.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.919
- It's in?
JOHN: Yep!

53:20.920 --> 53:22.999
TIM: Oooh. It is in.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
Now, do I... like this?

53:29.240 --> 53:32.240
If I do this...

53:32.880 --> 53:34.759
JOHN: Ah, ah,
I think you better stop!

53:34.760 --> 53:36.439
TIM: Pull out?
JOHN: Pull out.

53:36.440 --> 53:38.239
Slowly! Arggh, God!

53:38.240 --> 53:41.240
(Laughs) Are you OK?

53:41.440 --> 53:44.079
Yeah! That was great.

53:44.080 --> 53:47.080
* BLONDIE: Dreaming

53:47.840 --> 53:50.840
I'm glad to see the back
ofthat old toaster...

53:50.960 --> 53:53.960
No!

54:07.560 --> 54:10.560
* I don't wantto
live on charity

54:13.440 --> 54:16.440
* Pleasure's real
oris itfantasy?

54:19.200 --> 54:22.200
* Reel to reel
is living verite... *

54:34.560 --> 54:36.679
Oh! Stunner!

54:36.680 --> 54:39.680
(All exclaim)

54:41.600 --> 54:44.600
His name is Ian.

54:44.640 --> 54:47.639
He's new.

54:47.640 --> 54:50.199
TIM: I've been trying
not to stare.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.999
Tuesday night at my place
was interesting.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
God! What does Peter think?

54:56.120 --> 54:59.120
Well, those two in the shower
together is a sight to behold.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.239
You and John are so sweet,
though.

55:04.240 --> 55:07.240
Like an old married couple.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.679
This prick's been
eyeballing me.

55:16.680 --> 55:19.680
Where?

55:20.280 --> 55:23.280
MAN: Either he's threatened
or he's turned on.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.640
Oi, love.
Your friends are poofters!

55:29.720 --> 55:32.559
Yeah, I worked that out.
I'm a dyke, you deadshit.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.560
(Laughter)

55:37.040 --> 55:38.839
- Fuck it.
- What are you doing?

55:38.840 --> 55:40.839
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

55:40.840 --> 55:43.840
(Cheering and whooping)

55:47.760 --> 55:50.519
- Oh! (Screams)
(All exclaim)

55:50.520 --> 55:52.439
Oi, back off, mate!

55:52.440 --> 55:55.440
- Why? Is that your boyfriend?
- I don't wanna fight you.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.159
Hey! Fuck off, you deadshit!

55:59.160 --> 56:00.879
(Shouting)
- Stop it! Stop it!

56:00.880 --> 56:03.880
- Let go of him!
- Leave him alone!

56:04.200 --> 56:06.919
(Shouting and screaming)

56:06.920 --> 56:09.439
- Get off, you little toad!
WOMAN: Don't you touch him!

56:09.440 --> 56:12.039
MAN: Don't touch him!

56:12.040 --> 56:14.439
Get away! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

56:14.440 --> 56:17.039
You're hurting him! Stop it!

56:17.040 --> 56:19.239
John! John! John! John! No!

56:19.240 --> 56:21.719
MAN: Come on, Rose!
- Let's go.

56:21.720 --> 56:23.399
MAN: Get out!
- Get away!

56:23.400 --> 56:26.400
(Shouting and screaming)
MAN: Fucking out now!

56:26.640 --> 56:28.559
We have every right
to be here!

56:28.560 --> 56:31.560
- Come on, Tim! Let's get out!
- Fucking out!

56:31.640 --> 56:33.519
WOMAN: My dad would
come home after work

56:33.520 --> 56:35.119
and he would look at me
like this!

56:35.120 --> 56:37.759
He would look at me like there
was something wrong with me!

56:37.760 --> 56:40.760
Relax, I'm a nurse. At least,
I will be when I graduate.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.639
We should go back,
trash the place.

56:45.640 --> 56:47.079
Settle down, Tim.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.839
MAN: We should go
to the police, yeah?

56:48.840 --> 56:51.840
Huh! Those fascists?

56:57.560 --> 57:00.560
How's that face?

57:02.200 --> 57:05.200
I've had worse
on the footy field, Peter.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.199
JOHN: I don't want to have sex
with other people!

57:09.200 --> 57:10.879
TIM: OK, but would you
allow me to?

57:10.880 --> 57:12.439
Who with?

57:12.440 --> 57:13.999
Well, maybe just once.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.159
Would you let me try it once,
see how it goes?

57:16.160 --> 57:17.719
I don't know
why you'd want to.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.279
Is it something about me?

57:19.280 --> 57:20.879
There are things
our generation

57:20.880 --> 57:22.479
are supposed to be
experiencing

57:22.480 --> 57:24.759
and I don't believe it's fair
to expect our lovers

57:24.760 --> 57:26.239
to fulfil all of our needs.

57:26.240 --> 57:28.759
- Where'd you read that?
- Don't dismiss my politics.

57:28.760 --> 57:31.039
So, this is about your
politics, not your stiffy!

57:31.040 --> 57:32.719
'Stiffy'? (Laughs)

57:32.720 --> 57:33.999
Who calls it a stiffy?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.519
John, am I the only boyfriend
in the world asking this?

57:36.520 --> 57:39.159
- The only one asking me.
- I'm not!

57:39.160 --> 57:42.039
This is normal now! You are
begrudging me being normal.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.599
I don't want to talk
about this.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.159
I came here to see
Nine To Five.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.759
Apparently
it's very funny, OK?

57:46.760 --> 57:49.199
MAN 1: Good boy!
MAN 2: Alison!

57:49.200 --> 57:51.439
(Cheering and laughter)

57:51.440 --> 57:52.999
Come on, come on!

57:53.000 --> 57:55.199
MAN 1: Let's do this, guys!
MAN 2: Yes, yes!

57:55.200 --> 57:58.200
(Cheering)

57:59.040 --> 58:00.599
That's my boy!

58:00.600 --> 58:02.519
MAN: Come on!

58:02.520 --> 58:04.359
(Shouting and cheering)

58:04.360 --> 58:06.399
TIM: Unfair advantage!
Unfair advantage!

58:06.400 --> 58:08.239
IAN: Come on, jump up!
Jump up!

58:08.240 --> 58:10.959
MAN 1: Are you ready for this?
MAN 2: That's not allowed.

58:10.960 --> 58:13.960
TIM: Mine, mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!

58:14.240 --> 58:16.719
(Cheering)
TIM: Giddy up! Giddy up!

58:16.720 --> 58:19.639
IAN: I've got it!
- Giddy up! Giddy up!

58:19.640 --> 58:20.759
MAN: Pick it up!

58:20.760 --> 58:22.439
WOMAN: Kick it back,
you queens!

58:22.440 --> 58:25.039
MAN: That's OK!
Fast game's a good game...

58:25.040 --> 58:27.279
- Think you found the brakes.
- Erect already?

58:27.280 --> 58:29.839
- Oh, yes.
- (Both murmur and laugh)

58:29.840 --> 58:31.119
TIM: No.

58:31.120 --> 58:34.120
MAN: Surf's up!
(Chatter)

58:35.240 --> 58:37.359
MAN 1: Woody!
MAN 2: Come on, Woody.

58:37.360 --> 58:40.360
- I'm really sorry, Tim(!)
- Oof!

58:44.240 --> 58:47.240
John! I'm sorry!

58:48.320 --> 58:51.239
I'm just a little bit drunk!

58:51.240 --> 58:52.999
PETER: Give you a lift?
JOHN: Thanks.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
TIM: Are you still staying
at my place tonight?

58:58.040 --> 59:01.040
(Dance music blares)

59:06.280 --> 59:09.280
- What'll it be?
- A beer, please.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.159
Got the time?

59:15.160 --> 59:18.160
I don't have the time.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.800
(Moans)

59:50.840 --> 59:53.279
Arggh! Ow, ow! Jesus!

59:53.280 --> 59:54.999
Is it bleeding?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.799
- I thought it might be...
- What?!

59:56.800 --> 59:58.519
.. pleasurable.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.520
(Laughs)

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.719
I did that thing.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.439
What thing?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.519
Put my name down, like I said.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.520
For acting school.
Now I have to audition.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.359
Good.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.999
It'll mean moving.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The acting school's in Sydney,
if I get in.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.839
Melbourne would be better.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.840
It's the national drama
school.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.359
I think you'll get in.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.360
Thank you.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.399
Long-distance would be hard.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.400
That's why I thought
we should have a trial.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.919
A trial?

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.920
A trial separation.
Are you alright with that?

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.599
No.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.600
When does it start?

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.439
I don't know.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.119
Now?

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.120
Well, yes, I guess so.
It has to start now.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.439
Can I still sleep here
tonight?

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.559
Of course. I'm not gonna kick
you out of my bed.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.359
- Well, I don't know!
- Stay tonight.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.279
Yeah, I'd prefer to stay
tonight.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.879
Stay tonight,
but tomorrow it starts.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.880
- Tomorrow it starts?
- I don't know.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.319
Doesn't mean we can't cuddle.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.320
I think it does.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.800
(Crying)

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.680
(Cries)

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.120
(Examiners murmur)

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Thanks, Tim.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.560
* Love won'tannihilate hatred

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.360
* Itbuilds you up till
you've had enough... *

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.759
TIM: Hey!
MAN 1: Tim!

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.399
MAN 2: Timmy!
PEPE: Hello, you!

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.839
WOMAN: What have you done
to your hair? (Laughs)

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.239
I like it! It's just so...

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.159
GIRL: Are you coming?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.160
* Gives you the score
Then won'tsetyou free

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.199
* Just when you sayno more

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.159
* A hand asks fora key

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.160
* Oh, I never wanted to be

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.520
* In Quasimodo's dream. *

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.560
Hello, bald eagle.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.920
* Shall I beg the ringmaster

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.640
* Please find anotherme? *

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.880
I found out about
drama school, John.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.880
Promise you won't make
a big deal.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.999
Hey, guys!
Tim got into drama school!

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.559
MAN: Yes!

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.839
He's gonna be
the next Mel Gibson!

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.799
(Cheering and applause)
TIM: Oh, thank you.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.399
Whoo-hoo!

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.279
(Applause)
- Stop it!

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.039
Keep going.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.040
(Cheering and applause)

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.520
(Both sniff)

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.519
TEACHER: Walk like men
and women.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.520
Lead with your headlights.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.999
How is the public
ever going to believe

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.399
this leading man
wants to win the dame?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.319
Are you trying to teach us
self-loathing, is that it?

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.320
No. This is about gesture,
tone of voice, courage.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.200
Look at you. That's a very
womanly way to hold yourself.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.720
A third ofthis class is gay,
did you know that?

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.400
You're more
than your sexuality, Tim.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.760
Walk. Long neck.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.800
Come on.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.600
Oh!

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.479
Oh, you want some rough-house?

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.199
I'll give you some
rough-house!

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.159
- Line!
- No.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.279
- Line!
- No!

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.279
Can we stop playing games,
please, Barry?

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.959
How about you listen

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.799
to the other person on stage
for once?

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.919
- I have a right...
- You think you're an actor?

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.359
I think you want to be the
loudest person in the room.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.279
- I'm just...
- I'm speaking.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.759
I think you're here to be
validated, to be loved.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.319
Find that elsewhere.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.159
We're not giving you that, and
your audience certainly won't.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.160
Now, play the blasted scene!

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.199
I can't.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.759
Well, I think
that's answered that.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.760
Brett, you'll do Stanley.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.160
* PETE SHELLEY: Homosapien

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.720
* I'm the cruiser,
you're the loser

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.040
* Me and you, sir
Homosapien too

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.880
* Homosuperior in my interior

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.919
* But from the skin out

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.639
* I'm homosapien too

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.640
* And you're homosapien too

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.960
* And I'm homosapien like you

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.440
* And we're homosapien too

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.679
* And the world's buit of age
are a stage

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.680
* Where we act out our lives

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.759
* And the words in the script
seem to fit

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.760
* 'Cept we have some surprise

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.919
* I just want this to last

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.920
* Or my future is past
and all gone

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.038
* And ifthis is the case

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.040
* Then I'll lose in life's
race from now on... *

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.879
- Chookas!
- Chookas, darling.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.880
The house is open.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.359
Is he here?

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.439
Chookas! Have a good show!

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.038
No.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.040
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba!

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.960
More than any desire
anywhere...

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.960
.. deep down,
in my deepest heart,

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.600
.. I want you back again.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.158
Please... John...

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.038
Don't say any more.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.040
You're making me cry
so dreadfully.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:32.439
(I'm going to
fucking kill you!)

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.960
JOHN: Tim, get off!
I have to go.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.040
Take me with you! I can't bear
that mean drama school!

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.359
They say I'm too gay,
too loud...

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:51.359
- They might be right.
- ... I'm too self-centred.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.559
And I want my Tupperware back.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.239
Sure, if I visit again.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.919
Might you visit again?

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.599
(Tim turns engine off)

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.600
Maybe I'll check out
some chiro clinics up here.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.359
Really? Ow! Ow!

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.360
Hang on,
this is knackering me.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.719
I spoke to Dad
about a business loan.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.719
It would have to be
Melbourne but.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.720
Sydney needs
chiropractors too.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.960
Thanks for coming
all this way.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.919
I wasn't sure you would.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.920
Good to give
the new wheels a run.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.400
Hmm.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.040
Mum and Dad don't want me
to move up here.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.159
All this stuff on TV.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.519
What - gay means AIDS?

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.679
For them, I guess it does.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.839
Pathetic!

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.840
I knew you'd react like that.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.760
Well, I'll be waiting for you,
John.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.560
If you choose Sydney.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.560
- John.
- What?

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.720
Can I kiss you?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.080
Give it a go.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.520
* All the times I've come

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.880
* Here, butnow they're gone

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.879
* Seasons don'tfear
the reaper

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.880
* Nordo the wind, sun,
orthe rain

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.519
* We can be like theyare

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.520
* Come on, baby
Don'tfearthe reaper

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.960
* Baby, take myhand
Don'tfearthe reaper

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.159
* We'llbe able to fly
Don'tfearthe reaper

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.160
* Baby, I'm yourman

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.119
* La, la, la, la, la... *

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.120
You got everything?

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.280
Can I have my sign?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
- It's mine.
- Dickhead.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Give it to Lois
for the trophy cabinet.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.640
Yep.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.239
You're doing the right thing.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.359
(Zip closes)

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.759
They were gonna guess anyway,

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.359
with me selling up
the business.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.039
I'm proud of you.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.919
Maybe I'll be brave enough
to tell mine.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.759
Not the week
of your sister's wedding.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.039
John. I know that.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.079
Hi, Tim. Hello.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.080
TIM: You gonna give me
a kiss goodbye?

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.519
We've got Aunt Mary
staying in your room,

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.359
but you should
be comfortable out here.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.359
Oh, you got those? Good.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.239
You gotta update your address,
mate.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.239
They're ancient.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.679
Did you hear we're having
a band at the reception?

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.279
Very good, they are.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.319
We'll be in the ballroom
over at Ripponlea.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.039
Did you open this one?

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.279
Maybe Mum. She's the one
who kept them for you.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.719
No, it'll be a big show,
don't you worry.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.319
We've got an orchestra
at the church.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.399
(Laughs) That's a bit
over the top, isn't it?

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.479
It's a small chamber
orchestra.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.639
So, it's a full nuptial,
communion and all?

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.640
- Is she Catholic still?
- It's what your sister wants.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.079
Best wedding I ever went
to was my friend Morna's.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.679
It was a simple
exchanging of vows

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.680
in a room full offriends.
It was very moving.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.319
WOMAN, ON PHONE: It'spart
ofourLook Back scheme.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.759
You donatedbloodin 1981.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.039
It waspooled with 19 others'.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.959
Mr Conigrave,
the patient who receivedit

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.919
has gone on to develop AIDS.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.119
We'd like you to be tested.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.959
It's fine. There's no need.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.960
I am positive,
but I was infected in 1985.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.399
You mean you were diagnosed
in 1985?

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.079
Yes.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.080
Really, there's no reason
to...

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.239
1981?

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.240
Mr Conigrave, you're one
ofthe lastto be contacted.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.440
The otherdonors
are all clear.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.280
Not this week, Tim.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.959
You read it?

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.559
Wash your hands.
I need some help.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.359
I'm flat-out with relatives
arriving from everywhere

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.799
and your father wants
his pre-wedding drinks.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.800
Al fresco is just not me.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.520
Now, can you see how to slice
and twist the salmon,

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.880
just like the picture?

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.639
TIM: I've been doing some
volunteering.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.439
Well, I get paid for it now.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.440
It's social work...
for the AIDS Council.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.080
Tell me I've nothing
to worry about.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.799
What a waste.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.759
All that talent.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.319
I'm not dead yet.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.399
I just don't understand
how you've got it!

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.400
I mean,
it's just you and John.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.400
- We've both got it.
- Oh, God.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.880
That beautiful boy.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.280
Is it from a donation? Is that
why the Red Cross are writing?

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.839
Would you prefer it that way?

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.840
Did I say that?
I didn't say that.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.840
I prefer none of it,
thank you!

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.680
After the wedding,
after all ofthis,

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.079
I think we should tell Dad.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.080
I'm making a mess!
Look at this!

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.320
This letter,
it's changed things.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960
It says I could have been
infected... since university.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.920
John and I, we always
assumed he was first.

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.480
I think I was comfortable
with that.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.160
Now it's...

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:15.880
Mum, it's like I've killed
the man that I love!

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.280
FATHER: Now, what's all this
slacking off in the kitchen?

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.440
(Indistinct speech)

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.200
TIM: How did it go?

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.560
Mum just kept blowing
her nose.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.600
Dad wanted to talk
about my business insurance.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.119
They wanted to fall apart
alone.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.120
MAN: Drink, gentlemen?
- I can't.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.400
I suppose your parents
assume I infected you.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.800
No. Why would
you even say that?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.639
I told my parents.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.640
Now?

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.559
- Why?!
- Because I...

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.559
How could you be so selfish?!

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.119
You are gorgeous.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.120
Timothy's Aunty Gae told me
about the eyelashes.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.599
- They're false.
(Aunts laugh)

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.600
We loved your dog food
commercial, Timothy.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.759
Thanks.
I'm doing social work now.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.760
- And writing another play.
- He's my PR man.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.639
Hey, do you reckon you could
introduce me to Mel Gibson?

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.519
(Laughter)

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.639
I work for the AIDS Council.
I'm on the hotline

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.599
and the van that goes
up and down the Wall.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.079
That's where male sex workers
find their clients,

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.839
and we empower them
to have safe sex

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.399
and have someone to talk to.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.359
I find it really rewarding.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.079
That's nice for you, dear.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.080
John, I'm stealing you.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.680
Come on, son.
Let's show 'em how it's done.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.879
No.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.880
- Come on.
- No.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.959
- Who's leading?
BOTH: I am.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.919
* I hate to say it

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.920
* But you have a right
to be free

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.040
* I know it's the way
it should be

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.480
* But I'm too far... *

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.200
Hey! This old bloke's been
asking about you all night.

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.760
Here you are, Timothy.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.320
* I love you so much
for so long... *

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.920
NICHOLAS: (Laughs)
Oh, come on, Aunty Gae.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.640
Hey, Tim. Nice one, brother.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.520
You alright?

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.479
I'm here, John.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.519
(Indistinctly)
My lung has popped...

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.039
MAN: Try not to talk, John.
We don't want a coughing fit.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.399
Was it the chemo?

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.119
More likely a burst PCP cyst.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.120
You're his boyfriend?
You're staying?

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.799
Now, how's that local?

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.800
JOHN: OK.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.840
I'm about to cut now, John.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.159
Right, this is going
to hurt a bit, John.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.160
(John breathes heavily)

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.999
That's it, bubbling away.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
When the bubbles stop,
we know it's healed.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.440
(Pop music plays on stereo)

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.720
(Coughing and wheezing)

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.640
(CD skips)

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.880
(Coughing)

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.600
(Coughing continues)

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.440
(Coughing continues)

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.120
JOHN: Tim!

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.239
MAN: Nearly there.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.159
(Wheezes)

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.160
MAN: Good, good.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.759
Just a little bit more.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.479
(John whimpers)

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.480
And done.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.999
He'll be in for a few days,
at least.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.879
- You have some rest.
TIM: I'm fine.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.880
It's seeing him in pain
I can't bear.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.039
He'll need his boyfriend
healthy.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.599
Ifthe lung doesn't stick,

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.199
it's going to
need to be surgery,

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.999
but only when
he's strong enough.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
He'll need you.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.520
Our freezer is chockers.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.720
Penny Cook
has made you minestrone.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.920
Morna has made you minestrone.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.480
Someone has made you...
I'm not sure what that is.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.560
JOHN: Why'd you bring those?

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.919
Penny's comes
with a little pesto

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.920
in a separate container, so...

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.360
.. let's go with that.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.559
I'm sorry.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.519
Snotty tissue got eaten

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.520
by the Simpson fully
automatic.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.640
Didn't you check?

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.960
Can't you do anything right?

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.040
(High-pitched ringing)

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.680
I'm sorry.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.399
I think I forgot the pesto.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.400
(High-pitched ringing
continues)

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.400
(Alarm beeps)

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.319
TIM: Will I still be able
to write?

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.919
MAN: Shall we look
at your scan?

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.519
TIM: I've been looking at it.
Toxoplasmosis, isn't it?

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.639
- Yes, it is.
- I did a theatre thing once.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.519
Transmits via cats.
I wrote this thing.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.879
I knew I'd get it eventually.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.759
I'm thinking of getting people
together, starting something.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.319
I'm feeling very creative and
I don't want to waste that,

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.879
if I'm gonna have
brain damage.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.559
- Lesions don't eat the brain.
- Which is a terrific phrase!

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.119
But they do put
pressure on it.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.959
You're feeling up -
creative, you say?

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.199
What about dementia,
memory loss? Sorry, go on.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.759
We'll learn more
as we treat it.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.319
I'm convinced it will happen.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.439
I'm thinking about getting
people together.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.759
You said that.

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.239
I'm having ideas
and I could start something.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.759
- Tim? I think you're manic.
- Do you?

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.439
Yes - the cells in your brain

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.440
have become sensitive
to certain neurotransmitters.

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.479
- I'm prescribing Haloperidol.
- No, I'm good. We're good.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.559
John's in here
and he's being looked after.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.639
I think we'll have to
admit you.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.559
I don't want you spending
all your money

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.279
or thinking that you're Jesus.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.719
What happens to my soul
if I go mad?

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.720
Does it stay trapped inside
or is it floating free?

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.640
MAN: I don't want to be here!
I don't want to be here!

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.920
- Get me out of...
(Voices murmur indistinctly)

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.040
I don't want to be here!
Take me home!

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.240
You alright there, darling?

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.239
(Laughter)

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.240
TIM: OK.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.760
(Tim laughs)
OK, one from the side.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:27.040
(Camera clicks)

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.880
Are you making fun of me?

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.160
I'm doing it
because you look so beautiful.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.800
- Hello, son.
- Hmm?

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.839
Hi.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.840
We're just... in a good mood.
Had some good news.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.079
Would you like a chair, Bob?

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.959
From the flat.

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.960
Bills and stuff, eh?
Thank you.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.239
So, what are the doctors
saying, John?

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.240
TIM: He's not allowed to talk.
Er, the lung again.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.599
- But we've had...
- Good news, Dad.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.600
TIM: He's not
supposed to talk.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.040
He's had some good news.
John's in remission.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.959
When he's strong enough,

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.759
he'll go into surgery,
and they'll open him up,

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.760
and see the snips and snails
and puppy dog tails

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.479
and sew up the lung.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.480
Can you believe it? Remission!

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.560
You've worked hard for it,
son.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.320
TIM: They're saying we can
probably go home

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.039
in the meantime.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.040
What have you done
to his hair?

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.079
It was getting ratty.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.359
(Tell him about Christmas.)

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.239
- Beg your pardon?
- (Put your hearing aid in.)

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.240
- 'Put your hearing aid in. '
- I don't like wearing it.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.119
John's talking about going
home for Christmas.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.919
They can't operate
until January.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.920
BOB: Your mum'll like that.
We'll fly you back down, John.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.919
He's had a pneumothorax.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.920
The airlines won't let him
fly, but I'll drive him down.

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.160
(All speak foreign language)

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.879
I found it in the drawer
ofthe desk.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.880
I have some concerns.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.599
Why is Tim getting everything?

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.039
(Softly) I want to make sure
he's alright if I die.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.439
I'm sorry,
I didn't get any ofthat.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:44.440
He said he wants to make sure
I'm alright if he dies.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.400
Tim, your will is,
um, made out similarly.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.280
It is.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.760
So, if John dies first,
you inherit his belongings,

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.919
then say you die
a month later,

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.639
everything goes
to your family?

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.640
I don't think that's fair.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.360
I put John through school
and college,

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.920
and I think I deserve half.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.280
Who owns the television
and the video?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.559
BOB: And the bed?

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.560
Some things we bought
together. Can I have a look?

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.359
Just trying to remember who
bought the Vegemite last.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.759
- It was probably you, John.
- Yes, you go through it.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.760
- Hurts my lungs to laugh.
- Oh, sorry.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.959
And the boy videos -

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.199
your family would enjoy
Frisky Pool Party 7.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.999
That's right!

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.119
(Coughs)

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:01.120
Tim, the car isn't yours.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.319
TIM: No, but I need it.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.519
BOB: John told Lois
that you had to have a scan.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.159
TIM: Did he, now?

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.999
- For your eyes.
- My eyes are fine, Bob.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
- Something in your brain.
- No, that's not right.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.359
I'm on medication.
I am allowed to drive.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.479
I'm sorry, John.
I helped pay for that car.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:20.480
I would like it to come back
to Melbourne, please.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.039
Might find something to eat.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.040
And some little red dots
to mark up the apartment.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.480
Some things are only fair.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.800
You're telling people
I have cancer?

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.160
It's AIDS, Dad.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.079
The cancer is from AIDS.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.080
BOB: That's something you have
to take up with your mother.

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.079
I'm taking it up with you.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.080
I'm not ashamed
ofwhat I have.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.760
* RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
Forever And A Year

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.520
* Say, I maybe gone today

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.680

* You will stayhere

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.440
Will you screw me?

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.280
* Say, can you see them there?

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:54.440
* Those darkened clouds
in the distance

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.600
* So close to here

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.640
* We oughtto go, mydear

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
* Whatare you saying, pray?

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.759
(John coughs)

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.760
* I cannot wipe mybrow

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.400
* 'Twas nota drop ofrain

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.200

* Foreverand a year. *

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.319
I can't kiss you. You've got
this thing on your face.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.879
How's he doing?

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.319
LOIS: This is Peter.
He helped resuscitate John.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.039
PETER: Hey, Tim.
- Peter!

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.040
- Hey.
LOIS: You know each other?

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.119
TIM: From the gay group
at uni.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.679
We've had a few
ofthe Gaysoc boys through.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.680
Who from Gaysoc?
They here now?

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.160
PETER: Tim, have you eaten?
TIM: I'm good.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.599
Mrs Caleo?

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.559
We're not supposed to, but
I could speak to the kitchen.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.560
LOIS: Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.119
Tim? I thought Lois had...

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.039
I offered.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.040
Just gotta grab something
for John from under the tree.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.240
Right. Come in, come in.

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.559
I'll help you.
I wrapped most ofthem.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.560
I'm just after the one
from John to me.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.440
The funeral will be held
at a church here in Melbourne,

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:31.520
and we don't want people
making statements.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.759
You mean about AIDS?

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.760
And the whole... gay thing.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.120
Everybody knows anyway.
No need.

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.400
TIM: You know that's against
John's wishes?

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.040
Be it on your conscience.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.080
Such a tragedy.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.160
How did this happen?

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.359
It's a Stable Table!

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:47.360
So you can eat
in front ofthe teev.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.240
Better than the pyjamas
Mum got me.

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.080
Suppose you're not gonna keep
the wrapping.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.440
(Gasps) Darling!

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.039
What on earth is it?

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:22.040
It's a document holder,
for writing.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.200
It's got a little motorised
clamp that moves up and down

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:30.240
when you use the foot pedal.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.239
It's... bizarre.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.799
You don't like it?

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.800
It's good. I just don't know
that the clamp is that useful.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.360
You always have to tell
the truth, don't you, Timothy?

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:50.400
It's for when you write.

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.960
I'll use it. I promise.

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.879
The first present
you ever gave me

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:24.880
was wrapped
in Essendon colours.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.599
Sounds right.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.600
Bryan Ferry's
Let's Stick Together.

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.559
How do you remember that?

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.560
I remember everything.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.840
You said you saw him
on Countdown

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.439
and he made you feel
a bit sweaty.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.719
- Did I?
- (Laughs)

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:47.720
- What a poof.
- (Laughs)

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.320
(Coughs)

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.040
Tim...

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.120
.. when they revived me,
before I came around...

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.319
.. I was just not here
for a bit,

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.320
and it was so easy, Timba.

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.960
Are you OK hearing that?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
No!

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.240
I'm not ready for you to go.

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.280
We've said our goodbyes.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.760
Haven't we?

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:10.720
You can't go
without me at your side.

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.200
That's the deal.

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.120
(John groans)

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.800
(Wheezes)

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:37.039
(Moans)

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.040
Oh, shut up, John.
We're trying to sleep(!)

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.200
(Both laugh)

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.840
He was my favourite.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.639
I'm not supposed to say it -

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.640
all my boys
are wonderful, but...

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.520
.. he was my favourite.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Never a problem.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.840
Lois, do you mind
if I have a moment with John?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I ought to stretch my legs,
any rate.

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:55.040
In the schoolyard,
I noticed a boy.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:00.640
Just...
listening to his friends

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:07.840
with his hands
in his pockets.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.519
Smiling.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.520
What is it about his face?

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.800
In class, lined up my books
and tartan pencil case...

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.800
.. and watched the door.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.680
Then he walked in.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.680
The boy with
the amazing eyelashes.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.400
John Caleo was in my class.

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.519
I want you to know
I'll do my best to include you

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.159
when it's time
for the funeral.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.279
I'll talk about you
as his... friend.

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.959
Are you happy with that?

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.960
We... we have been together
for 15 years.

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:13.520
He is my husband.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.199
There'll be nothing gained

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.959
by further alienating
the parents.

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.399
Why?

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.959
So they can reclaim him

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:22.079
from the dirty poofter
who corrupted him?

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.080
Tim?

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.559
(Footsteps thud)

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:35.560
(John wheezes)

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.800
(I'm here.)

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.840
(John wheezes)

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.880
(Silence)

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:37.840
Excuse me.

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.960
(Sobs)

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.280
* In death's dark vale
I fear no ill

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.600
* With thee, dear Lord,
beside me

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.480
* Thy rod and staff
my comfort still

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:48.200
* Thy cross before
to guide me. *

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.560
PRIEST: We're here to mourn
the loss of our dear John.

01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:01.040
Our hearts go out
to his father, Bob,

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.679
his mother, Lois,

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.680
and his brothers, Michael,
Paul, Chris, and Anthony.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And then to his friends,
Tim and Peter...

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.319
.. who were such
a wonderful support to him

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.239
in the last few months.

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:26.240
(Scoffs)

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.799

Surroundedbyorange trees
andbougainvillea.

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:43.880
(International dial tone)

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:50.039
I visited the island ofSalina
yesterday,

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:53.040
the island where your
grandparents were born.

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:56.840
It was a bitlike
aprivate pilgrimage.

01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:59.719
The cafe is onlyopen

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.999

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.359
TIM: I mean, the onlything
I had to live for

02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.119
is these two things
thatl'm writing,

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.679
which I'd like
to finish both of.

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:11.959
One's aplay,

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.159
and the otherone is a book
aboutmyloverand I,

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.079
which I've started, and...

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:18.839
And the otherthing too is,
I suppose,

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.919
I've been expecting to be dead
forso long

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:22.719
that, I mean, almostnow
the idea

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:24.599
ofgetting to something
like 40

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.399
wouldbejust, like...
(Laughs)

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.400
But, um, you know...

02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.239
I think thatmightbe the end,
is itnot?
