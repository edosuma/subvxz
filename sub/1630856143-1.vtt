[Morgan] Jacobs telling her story

45:42.656 --> 45:48.495
we wouldn't understand the way
sexual predation was built in

45:48.579 --> 45:51.707
to this system
that was allegedly about work.

45:52.958 --> 45:57.504
And ironically, historians, they assumed
it was written by a white woman,

45:57.588 --> 46:01.383

48:14.516 --> 48:19.438

that made this great sacrifice

48:19.521 --> 48:21.481

48:21.982 --> 48:23.942

48:33.076 --> 48:36.038

49:32.552 --> 49:35.722

50:07.713 --> 50:11.466
who saw the moral wrongs of slavery,
but let's be clear.

50:12.175 --> 50:13.468
He was just anti-slavery

50:13.552 --> 50:16.096
because of how he felt
the economy could benefit

50:16.179 --> 50:18.432
from moving away from slavery.

[Jones-Rogers] We need to look
at all of what he said,

not just what he said
in the Emancipation Proclamation.

50:25.313 --> 50:31.111
If we do that, then we realize that
Abraham Lincoln is a perplexing character,

with something personal.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.723
With something emotional.

By connecting that idea
of protecting the women in your community,

58:04.981 --> 58:06.900
lynchings were at their height,

58:06.983 --> 58:12.489
and the justifications for why
so many Black people were being lynched,

58:12.572 --> 58:15.575
was because
of what those Black people did wrong.

58:18.369 --> 58:21.998
[Cunningham] It was not just about
the person who was hanging on the tree

58:22.081 --> 58:25.919

58:26.002 --> 58:28.004
that they often did not do.

58:28.838 --> 58:32.800
The act of lynching
was also there to inflict terror,

want to be hanging from a tree too.

of white supremacy in America.

59:35.780 --> 59:38.783
It is a very powerful way

59:38.866 --> 59:45.373
for white people to explain
why it's important for a white power elite

[Reagan] Crime is an American epidemic.

From these statistics, a portrait emerges.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:10.583
The portrait is that
of a stark, staring face.

A face that belongs

The invention of Black criminality

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:03.302
is by such intentional design,

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.803
yet he was murdered
with no more consideration

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.513
than if he had been a dog.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:07.309
This is what opened my eyes
to what lynching really was,

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:12.314
an excuse to get rid of Negroes
who were acquiring wealth and property

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.401
and thus, keep the race terrorized.

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.445
[purposeful music playing]

01:09:27.079 --> 01:09:30.040
[Wells] The more I studied the situation,
the more I was convinced

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:33.335
that the Southerner
had never gotten over his resentment

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:37.464
that the Negro was no longer
his plaything, his servant,

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:39.592
and his source of income.

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.636
[purposeful music continues]

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.732
[Wells] During these years,
more than 10 thousand Negroes

01:09:54.815 --> 01:09:56.901
have been killed in cold blood,

01:09:56.984 --> 01:10:01.030
without the formality
of judicial trial and legal execution.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.241
The same record shows
that during all these years,

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.076
and for all these murders,

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.915
only three white men
have been tried, convicted and executed.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:14.501
[purposeful music continues]

01:10:21.842 --> 01:10:24.762
[Wells] The very frequent inquiry
made after my lectures

01:10:24.845 --> 01:10:26.972
by interested friends is,

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.183
"What can I do to help the cause?"

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:31.769
The answer always is,

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:34.897
"Tell the world the facts."

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:39.526
[mournful music playing]

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:54.625
When it comes to telling our stories,

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:59.838
and forcing this country
to take an unflinching look at itself,

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:01.215
she is the originator.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:08.639
We can see those postcards of lynch mobs,

01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:10.599
and their wives and children

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:15.271
standing underneath
a Black body swinging from a tree,

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.107
and know that it's horrifying.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:20.985
But we can only do that,

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:26.573
because Ida B. Wells took it upon herself,
in the day and time when it was happening,

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:28.742
to make sure that we knew,

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:32.413
to make sure that we could not look away.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.712
[dramatic music playing]

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.797
[clamoring]

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.843
[woman] You just opened my car door,

01:11:45.926 --> 01:11:48.387
so you're threatening
to drag me out of my own car.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.638
Get out of the car!

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.849
-[woman] You gonna stun me?
-I'll light you up. Get out!

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.186
-Get down, stay! On your face!
-[screaming]

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.564
-One, two…
-I am no threat to this officer.

01:11:58.647 --> 01:11:59.606
I've been threatened.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.526
-Watch the show, folks.
-My life is in danger! My life…

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.487
For what? Every time you see me,
you wanna mess with me.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.114
I'm tired of it! This stops today.

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:09.491
[bystander]
He's not responsive right now, bro.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.534
Does he have a pulse?

01:12:10.617 --> 01:12:13.787
No, bro! Look at him,
he's not responsive right now, bro.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.748
-Check for a pulse.
-Bro, are you serious?

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.167
You gonna let him sit here
with that on his neck?

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.045
[dramatic music continues]

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.444
[Cunningham] Police violence
is modern day lynching.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:49.573
State violence against Black bodies,
inside and outside of prison cells,

01:12:49.656 --> 01:12:51.533
is lynching.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.744
It is a form of racial terror,

01:12:53.827 --> 01:12:56.538
meant not only
to punish the Black individual,

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.709
but to send a message
to all Black people, to stay in our place.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.467
Even as policing
and their techniques have evolved,

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.969
there is a single common thread.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:15.557
[Cooper] Every time there's a huge,
fan out, push forward, go…

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.684
[crowd cheering]

01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:21.230
[loud cheering]

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.109
…there's a tidal wave back.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:29.363
A wall of white supremacy
that shows up and says, like,

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:31.949
"This far and no farther."

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:36.954
[dramatic music intensifies]

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.539

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:47.673
[clamoring]

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.093
[Perry] The response to Black progress

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:52.636
is punishment.

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.138
[siren blaring]

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:55.806
[Perry] It's not articulated like that.

01:13:55.889 --> 01:13:59.226
It's articulated as problems of crime,
problems of drugs.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.061
But the reality is,

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:06.525
it's an effort to reassert
racial domination through "order."

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:11.405
This nation must make
an all-out effort to combat crime.

01:14:12.656 --> 01:14:14.867
Our country's laws must be respected.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.745
Order must be maintained.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.665
[Nixon] My friends,
let this message come through clear

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:23.167
from what I say tonight.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.379
The wave of crime
is not going to be the wave of the future

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.381
in the United States of America.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.593
The first responsibility of government

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.721
is law and order.

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:41.435
I am the law and order candidate.

01:14:41.518 --> 01:14:44.688
[crowd cheering and applauding]

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.484
[applause]

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:54.490
[Mike Wallace] When you read stories
about difficulties,

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:59.870
riots in Omaha, or Cleveland,
or Brooklyn, or Chicago, or wherever…

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.372
I call them rebellions.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.041
-[Wallace] They're rebellions?
-Right.

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:06.752
[Wallace] And you--
you see nothing wrong with them?

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:10.839
I think that it is people
who are rebelling against a system

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.092
that has locked them
inside, tight, of ghettos,

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.844
that exploits and oppresses them,

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:19.806
and they have no means of redress
to break that system down.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.560
You have moved to destroy and disrupt,

01:15:24.102 --> 01:15:26.438
you have taken people away,

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.525
you have broken down their systems,

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.819
and you have called all that,
"civilization."

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:37.074
And we who have suffered at this,
are now saying to you,

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:40.410
"You are the killers of the dreams."

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.329
"You are the savages."

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:46.875
"Yes, it is you
who have always been uncivilized."

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.586
Civilize yourself.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:53.131
[gloomy music playing]

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:10.315
[Anderson] This nation
is drawn to the spectacular.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:13.318
Drawn to the flames.

01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:18.490
But we don't pay attention
to the kindling,

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:24.371
and the kindling are those policies
that are predicated on anti-Blackness.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.626
The denial of education, kindling.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:35.799
Unequal housing
and employment opportunities, kindling.

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:40.971
The hyper-policing
of Black communities, kindling.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.806
[Vanee] Stop-and-frisk…

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.684
[officer] Police, freeze!

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.185
[Benjamin] The war on drugs.

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:50.397
[Jeffers] Mass incarceration.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:58.905
[Cunningham] When you have policies,
structures, and institutions

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.491
that intentionally subjugate Black people,

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:06.330
you intentionally create communities
that can be continuously criminalized.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:07.873
And there's that thread again.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.751
[plaintive music playing]

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.094
[music fades]

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.056
[heartbeat]

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:32.981
[Kendi] When we think
of the history of racism in this country,

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:36.151
we're really thinking
of the history of power.

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:38.945
[unsettling music playing]

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.240
[Bush] Everything in our society

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:45.452
that has been used
to oppress Black people in this country,

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.246
it's so they can continue to keep power.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.458
The white elite.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.835
That's how they benefit.

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:56.129
They get to maintain their power.

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:02.552
[Cunningham] We are taught that power
is some kind of finite resource,

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:03.929
that it is a pie.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:08.892
The more I have, the less you have.
The more you have, the less I have.

01:18:13.313 --> 01:18:15.482
If your guiding principle is that,

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:20.862
whatever you have, keep it at all costs,
then you will do whatever you have to do.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:23.907
You will lie, you will cheat,
you will steal, you will kill,

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.701
to make sure you hold on to it.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:33.041
[evocative music playing]

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:55.814
[Dr. Angela Davis] The work
that ought to have been done

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:59.735
in the immediate aftermath of slavery,

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:04.406
the work of reorganizing, retooling,

01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:08.410
reconceptualizing the entire society,

01:19:09.202 --> 01:19:15.000
so that it might be possible
for previously enslaved individuals

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.419
to be free and equal,

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:20.088
that work was never done.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.882
[clamoring]

01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:23.633

[explosives going off]

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:31.266
[Jones-Rogers] I think that white people
are afraid of what will happen

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:34.186
if they put a mirror up to themselves.

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:40.358
They'll be able to see
that for generations, for centuries,

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:46.031
they have tormented and repressed
Black, brown and tan people.

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.950
They might not know
what to do with that history.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:51.161
There will be a "Then what?" question.

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:53.997
"Now that you know, then what?"

01:19:54.706 --> 01:19:57.250
They'll have to think about
whether they want to continue

01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:58.919
to live in that legacy.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:04.341
[Kendi] The heartbeat
of being racist is denial,

01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:10.388
is constantly looking for ways
to deny the persistence of racism.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:19.397
In order to address the way
in which racism is-- is baked in,

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:25.320
actually requires an active disposition.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.323
And that is anti-racism.

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:40.126
[gentle music playing]

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.395
[Kendi]
People are constantly thinking about,

01:20:58.478 --> 01:21:00.856
if we create an anti-racist society,

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:03.942
what are they going to lose,

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:07.529
as opposed to what they're going to gain.

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:17.038
[Perry] If you want an effective
social network of human beings,

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.457
an effective society,

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:23.712
keeping your heel on the back
of a portion of the community,

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.505
is probably not the best move.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:28.258
[gentle music continues]

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.805
[Jones-Rogers] I don't know what
it'll look like, but I know it's possible

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.392
because someone, some series of people,

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.394
put the system together
in the first place.

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:42.355
And if they can put the system together
in the first place,

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.149
then we can undo the system.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.859
[inaudible]

01:21:45.942 --> 01:21:49.696
[Cooper] It isn't about a better idea
that allows you to love your neighbor.

01:21:49.779 --> 01:21:52.198
That's not what we're talking about.

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:53.950
If all "anti-racist" means,

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.953
is that you personally
don't dislike people of color,

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:02.792
how does that make my life any better
because you personally don't dislike me?

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:08.506
But if, after you have reckoned with that,
you then go out and say,

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.343
"But how has our structural dislike
of these people,

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:14.220
our structural disregard of these people,

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:16.431
made it harder for them to actually live?"

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:19.267
Then, now we're talking.
Now we're cooking with grease.

Black people know what they want.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:30.070
They have ideas about what freedom
and liberation will look like.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:35.283
And it doesn't look
like this radical utopia.
