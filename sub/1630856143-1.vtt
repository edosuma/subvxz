01:00.977 --> 01:03.521
Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis,

01:03.605 --> 01:05.565
on the floor of the US Senate,

01:05.648 --> 01:08.985
opposed a bill
funding education for Black people.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.780
To justify this,

01:11.863 --> 01:15.158
he made up this story
he said was from the Bible.

01:15.241 --> 01:19.120
[wind blowing]

01:19.204 --> 01:21.039
[Kendi] In this made-up fairy tale,

01:21.122 --> 01:24.209
when Cain was exiled
from the Garden of Eden,

01:24.292 --> 01:27.462
he comes across the Land of Nod.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.799
[insects chirping]

01:31.549 --> 01:35.303
[Kendi] And in this Land of Nod,
according to Senator Davis,

01:35.845 --> 01:38.890
were the animals and beasts

01:38.973 --> 01:42.102
that were created before humans,
before Adam and Eve.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.651
[Kendi] And among these beasts,

01:49.734 --> 01:53.905
was a particular animal-like group,
with darker skin.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.698
[low growling]

01:55.782 --> 01:59.828
[Kendi] Senator Davis
was talking about Black people.

02:02.539 --> 02:09.045
"Black inferiority is the will of God,"
he said, "as confirmed by history."

02:11.422 --> 02:14.425
That's the story that Senator Davis told.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.594
The same Senator Davis who would go on

02:16.678 --> 02:20.473
to become the president
of the Confederate States of America

02:21.474 --> 02:28.022
to justify this idea that the inequality
between the Black and white races

02:28.106 --> 02:29.899
was "stamped from the beginning."

02:42.078 --> 02:46.040
[Dr. Carol Anderson] What happens
when we tell these stories, these myths,

02:46.124 --> 02:48.501
about who Black people are,

02:48.585 --> 02:51.796
and what their role
in American society is?

02:53.423 --> 02:58.928
These stories that are all about
what's wrong with Black people

02:59.012 --> 03:03.933
become part
of the background understandings

03:04.017 --> 03:10.148
that help to then spread ideas,
false ideas, about Black people.

03:12.317 --> 03:16.404
[Dr. Imani Perry] We need to look
at our history with a sober perspective.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.323
There's a real battle,

So the question is,

03:25.455 --> 03:29.292
how are we intentionally questioning
what is being given to us,

03:29.375 --> 03:31.419
and what we are ingesting?

03:31.502 --> 03:34.255
Because somebody is designing it.

Are they designing it
for our benefit or for theirs?

[HonorÃ©e Fanonne Jeffers]
When we look at race,

05:12.812 --> 05:19.110
we have to look at the fact
that race has not always been a given.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.821
[evocative music playing]

05:21.904 --> 05:25.950
[Jeffers] We came across that water,

05:26.034 --> 05:30.121
we were Igbo, we were Yoruba, Wolof.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.206

It is about slavery.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.400
[somber music playing]

05:59.484 --> 06:03.404
I think it's important for people to know
that the original "slave,"

06:03.488 --> 06:05.698
when people thought about that--
that original slave,

06:05.782 --> 06:07.867
it wasn't people who look like me.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.995
The Western European slave market

06:11.079 --> 06:14.999
had been dominated for hundreds of years
by Eastern European Slavs.

06:16.125 --> 06:20.171
The root for the term slave is Slav.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.007
So why suddenly,

06:23.091 --> 06:26.511
are we primarily enslaving,
you know, African people?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.138
[introspective music playing]

06:37.814 --> 06:40.191
[Dr. Jennifer L. Morgan]
We need to remember that slavery,

06:40.274 --> 06:41.859
it's a piece of human history.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.569
Humans enslave each other.

06:43.653 --> 06:47.615
They have for as long as there have been
empires and states and war,

06:48.533 --> 06:51.411
but something different happens in 1444.

06:52.328 --> 06:56.999
It's the moment in which
the first large cargo of captives,

06:57.083 --> 07:00.378
who are captured
by the Portuguese in Senegambia,

07:00.461 --> 07:03.256
are brought to Portugal to be sold.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.759
That, for me,

07:06.843 --> 07:12.056
is the beginning of what becomes
the transatlantic slave trade.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.643
[rhythmic, tense music playing]

07:19.522 --> 07:21.774
[Kendi] Prince Henry of Portugal

07:21.858 --> 07:26.863
saw the value of African people
in Western European slave markets.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.867
They were more valuable
than Eastern European Slavs

07:30.950 --> 07:33.077
because it was harder for them
to run away.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.830
It was harder for them
to blend in to the population.

07:37.915 --> 07:41.836
And so he financed
expeditions to the source.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.886
[Lynae Vanee]
When Prince Henry rode up on Africa,

07:49.969 --> 07:52.930
there was an opportunity
for him to take something.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.559
There was a method that he used
to get what he wanted,

07:56.642 --> 07:57.518
and it worked.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.104
[tense music continues]

08:02.607 --> 08:05.026
[Kendi] Prince Henry didn't want to admit

08:05.610 --> 08:12.241
that he was violently and brutally
enslaving African people to make money.

08:12.950 --> 08:18.289
And so he dispatched a royal chronicler
by the name of Gomes Zurara,

08:18.372 --> 08:19.999
to write his story.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.419
[somber music playing]

08:26.214 --> 08:29.217
[Kendi] Gomes Zurara
justified his slave trading

08:29.300 --> 08:33.471
by stating that Prince Henry
was doing it to save souls,

08:33.554 --> 08:38.309
and that these people in Africa
were inferior, were beast-like.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.622
[Kendi] Gomes Zurara's book

08:59.705 --> 09:05.503
wasn't just the first major text
by a European written in Africa,

09:05.586 --> 09:07.213
it also became a bestseller.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.426
These racist ideas
of African people as beastly

09:12.510 --> 09:15.054
started circulating around Western Europe.

09:17.181 --> 09:22.270
[Dr. Autumn Womack] The work
is naturalizing these racial hierarchies.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.314
They're indoctrinating us.

I mean, that's how popular culture works,
and that's how power works, right?

We don't realize it's working
until it's done its job.

[Jeffers] In order for you to do that
and to make yourself feel good about it,

09:39.996 --> 09:44.584
you've got to come up with a reason
why it was okay.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.530
to topple the capital of Virginia,

15:07.323 --> 15:10.784
It scared
wealthy white enslavers to death.

15:10.868 --> 15:14.747
[unsettling music playing]

15:14.830 --> 15:17.583
[Kendi] They saw that unity

15:17.666 --> 15:20.669
between white indentured servants
and enslaved Africans,

15:20.753 --> 15:22.254
you know, as their Armageddon.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.134
[Roberts] That made it very clear
to white landowners

15:27.217 --> 15:29.011
that they needed to invest more

15:29.094 --> 15:34.642
in separating indentured servants
and enslaved people.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.313
They created a whole legal apparatus

15:39.396 --> 15:43.692
to give indentured servants privileges

15:43.776 --> 15:46.737
by the fact that they were white,

15:46.820 --> 15:48.906
that Black people couldn't have.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.870
[Kendi] Ultimately, some of those
white indentured servants

15:54.954 --> 15:57.206
were able to work out their indenture.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.501
And then they were able to receive land

16:01.085 --> 16:02.544
and to make money.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.632
And then the money
they were able to acquire,

16:06.715 --> 16:11.428
allowed them to buy one of the very people

16:11.512 --> 16:14.515
that were involved,
side-by-side with them,

16:14.598 --> 16:16.225
for Bacon's Rebellion.

16:18.936 --> 16:23.107
And then they could turn around
and say to their former comrade,

16:23.190 --> 16:25.693
"You're in your position
and I'm in my position,

16:26.276 --> 16:29.071
not because of racist policies."

16:29.154 --> 16:31.782
"You're in your position
because you're inferior."

16:31.865 --> 16:34.868

16:36.245 --> 16:39.415
They want to throw
white children and colored children

16:39.498 --> 16:42.292
into the melting pot of integration,

16:42.376 --> 16:48.799
out of which will come a conglomerated,
mulatto, mongrel class of people!

16:48.882 --> 16:52.011
Both races will be destroyed
in such a movement.

16:52.094 --> 16:57.016
America was built by and for

16:57.099 --> 16:59.685
the white Christian people of this nation!

16:59.768 --> 17:02.479

17:05.357 --> 17:07.860
[Donald Trump] This is not just
a matter of values,

17:07.943 --> 17:11.613
it's also a matter of national survival.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.907
We have no choice.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.704
If we teach our children to hate America,

17:18.787 --> 17:22.499
there will be no one left
to defend our flag,

17:22.583 --> 17:25.919
or to protect our great country
or its freedom.

17:26.003 --> 17:26.879
[audience cheers]

17:28.464 --> 17:30.924
[Roberts]
This is the beginning of the idea

17:31.008 --> 17:35.137
that whiteness itself
is a benefit, is a privilege,

17:35.220 --> 17:39.516
is a status that white people
should want to have

17:39.600 --> 17:42.144
to the disadvantage of Black people.

[man 2] Equal rights for whites.

[woman 2] They'd all belong
to the white man.

[man 4] White majority.

17:54.698 --> 17:57.659
[man 5] We are white
and we are proud of being white.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.786
[woman 3] I'm white!

17:58.869 --> 18:02.289
[tense music continues]

18:03.040 --> 18:06.960
[Roberts] Whiteness is an idea

18:07.044 --> 18:12.674
of who is entitled
to certain privileges in a society.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.927
[inaudible]

18:15.010 --> 18:17.679
[Perry] Whiteness keeps you
from being at the bottom,

18:17.763 --> 18:20.265
even when you're poor,
even when you're broke,

18:20.349 --> 18:21.767
even when you're dispossessed.

18:22.684 --> 18:26.188
It's something that has been
really a core part

18:26.271 --> 18:28.482
of what I think
white American identity is.

18:31.693 --> 18:35.739
There's something that you always know
you have over other people.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.493
[Cunningham] Once upon a time,
if you were Polish and you came here,

18:39.576 --> 18:41.161
you weren't white, you were Polish.

18:41.245 --> 18:45.040
If you were Italian and you came here,
you weren't white, you were Italian.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.169
But somewhere along the line,
folks figured out,

18:49.253 --> 18:53.799
"Hey, if we link arms
under this umbrella of whiteness,

18:54.883 --> 18:57.010
then we can protect
our collective interest

18:57.094 --> 18:59.763
and make sure
nobody has access to our power."

19:04.226 --> 19:07.938
[Kendi] What whiteness does,
is it blinds them

19:08.021 --> 19:09.982
to see who the real robbers are.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.651
[Roberts] The people who actually benefit

19:12.734 --> 19:17.656
are a small group of wealthy, white elite

19:17.739 --> 19:22.119
that continues to accumulate
its wealth and power

19:22.202 --> 19:24.371
on the backs of everybody else.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.502
[chanting] Hear our voice! Hear our voice!

19:30.586 --> 19:33.755
[Kendi] You have white folks
who are struggling economically,

19:33.839 --> 19:36.633
and they think the source of their pain

19:37.634 --> 19:39.303
is people who don't look like them.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.805
[chanting] Niggers go to hell!

19:41.889 --> 19:42.723
Niggers go to hell!

19:42.806 --> 19:45.309
[protester] We don't need outsiders
helping us with our problems.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.978
We've been doing good
all these years we've been here,

19:48.061 --> 19:49.479
and we'll keep doing good enough.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.148
And we'll stay white, period.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.317
[chanting] You will not replace us!

19:53.901 --> 19:56.778
You will not replace us!

19:56.862 --> 20:00.282
[Vanee] Race is not a thing.
Race is not scientifically proven.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.744
You cannot trace
somebody's race in their DNA,

20:03.827 --> 20:07.539
but it has so many real
social ramifications

20:07.623 --> 20:10.250
because of the amount of people
who have bought into the myth.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.502
[atmospheric music playing]

20:13.378 --> 20:18.175
[interviewer] Do you think a Negro family
moving here will affect the community?

20:18.258 --> 20:20.719
Some of them, they're real dirty.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.264
But I wouldn't mind it if, you know,
they kept the neighborhood clean.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.892
Well, it just depends
upon that type of Negro.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.811
If they were like the, uh,
Negro that works for me,

20:29.895 --> 20:33.607
a fine, upstanding woman
who is proud of being a nigger,

20:33.690 --> 20:36.276
proud of her race, clean and industrious,

20:36.360 --> 20:37.986
no, I would not mind.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.241
[Cunningham] There isâ¦

20:43.242 --> 20:44.993
a temporary prize

20:46.203 --> 20:49.581
that whiteness loves to dangle
in front of the rest of us.

20:51.166 --> 20:55.295
Temporary prize
of acceptance, of upliftment.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.800
If you go to the right schools
and you speak the King's English,

20:59.883 --> 21:03.095
and you never step out of line
and you tell the truth,

21:03.178 --> 21:06.765
but never too much truth
to make whiteness uncomfortable.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.187
If you are just the right kind of Negro.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.399
[propulsive music playing]

21:18.568 --> 21:20.279
Let me put it to you this way.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.114
We are proud of being Black

21:22.197 --> 21:23.949
and of our Black Heritage.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.326
But white America
does not accept the concept

21:26.410 --> 21:28.453
that this is a multiracial society.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.123
They've always looked upon America
as being white,

21:31.206 --> 21:35.627
and hence, all of its propaganda
is directed at us, to convince us

21:35.711 --> 21:39.172
that somehow we must become white
before they will accept us.

21:40.382 --> 21:44.177
There's no other way to think.
I can't think African. Can't think Irish.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.929
I can't think Norwegian.

21:46.013 --> 21:49.349
I have to think within the struct--

21:49.433 --> 21:52.227
the society in which I live,
which is a white society.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.438
Does it bother you
to be called African-American?

21:54.521 --> 21:57.607
-It does because I'm a Cablinasian.
-[Oprah] A Cablinasian.

[Dr. Kellie Carter Jackson]
Assimilationist ideas are problematic

22:02.863 --> 22:06.450
because it compels you
to sort of shape-shift

22:06.533 --> 22:09.536
into something
that white people can approve of,

22:09.619 --> 22:11.621
that white people
won't feel threatened by,

22:11.705 --> 22:15.042
that white people can feel,
sort of safe in.

22:15.876 --> 22:19.212
"Why can't you just be white?"
You know? "Just assimilate."

22:20.255 --> 22:23.717
If you are Black and living
a contemporary Black experience,

22:23.800 --> 22:26.219
you probably have code switched
at some point in time.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.181
Hey, youngblood, lemme give you a tip.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.682
Use your white voice.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.559
Man, I ain't got no white voice.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.894
Come on, you know what I mean.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.230
You have a white voice in there,
you can use it.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.108
I'm just trying to give you some game.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.406
[Dr. Ruha Benjamin] An assimilationist
still adheres to the idea

22:46.490 --> 22:48.575
that a racialized group needs to change.

22:48.658 --> 22:52.037
"They need to work harder,
they need to value education,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.706
they need to take care
about their health more."

22:56.416 --> 22:59.378
[Womack] It's a different iteration
of inferiority,

22:59.461 --> 23:01.838
that there's no value
in what you have to offer.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.757
You either have
to assimilate into this way,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.760
or we need to create something different,
a different infrastructure,

23:06.843 --> 23:09.513
to account for your problematic presence.

23:09.596 --> 23:13.600
A high school senior was told
he can't walk the stage for graduation

23:13.683 --> 23:17.521
or even return to normal classes
unless he cuts his dreadlocks.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.776
There's an element
of being a progressive in that,

23:22.859 --> 23:24.653
because you believe people can change.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.614

and respect for other people.

and think about what has been presented
in recent history as acceptable behavior.

[Benjamin] That's the refrain we hear,
whether it's in 2021 or in 1821.

"There's something in you,
either in your body or in your culture,

23:55.475 --> 23:58.103
that is producing
the difference we're looking at."

23:58.186 --> 24:01.022
Who taught you to hate
the texture of your hair?

24:01.731 --> 24:05.235

that you bleach to get like the white man?

and the shape of your lips?

[Morgan] In the 18th century,

24:25.881 --> 24:29.551
European and American philosophers
are arguing

24:29.634 --> 24:32.053
that Black people should only be working.

24:34.014 --> 24:38.393
That Black bodies
are only good for brute labor

24:38.477 --> 24:44.483
because the highest form
of human expression is European,

24:44.566 --> 24:48.153
and the lowest form is African.

24:49.988 --> 24:55.202
That the only place where good art
and higher thinking is happening,

24:55.285 --> 24:59.539
is in Europe
or among people of European descent.

25:01.208 --> 25:06.296
They are so accustomed to the stories
they've been telling about Black people,

25:06.379 --> 25:13.386
that they literally cannot imagine
that a Black woman could produce art.

was the first Black woman

to publish a book of poetry
in North America.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.283
âª Why are you so displaced? âª

26:16.366 --> 26:19.536
It was a shock to everyone.

26:20.203 --> 26:24.666
It shook up notions about Africans

26:24.749 --> 26:28.503
and their intellectual capabilities.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.925
There was something about poetry,

26:34.509 --> 26:36.761
which was a fine art,

26:36.845 --> 26:41.516
which meant Africans
could experience emotions

"Those poems couldn't have been written

"That's-- that's crazy.
That is just impossible."

26:58.533 --> 26:59.826
And so as a result,

26:59.909 --> 27:04.122
a group of prominent Boston white men

27:04.205 --> 27:06.958
gathered together to investigate,

27:07.042 --> 27:11.212
and they brought
Phillis Wheatley before them

to really ascertain whether she actually

[sinuous music playing]

was a colleague of mine who said,

28:35.130 --> 28:39.759
"I'm concerned sometimes
about you, when you speak,

28:42.011 --> 28:45.598
because you sound ignorant."

28:47.517 --> 28:49.644
"And you're African-American,

28:49.728 --> 28:56.609
so I just don't want people
to make assumptions about you."

28:58.403 --> 28:59.320
And I said,

29:00.405 --> 29:04.367
"Let me tell you oneâ¦"
insert expletive, "â¦thing."

29:05.577 --> 29:10.957
"Anyâ¦" insert expletive,
"â¦that wants to pull my card,

29:11.040 --> 29:14.919
all I have to do
is throw my resume at their feet."

29:15.712 --> 29:17.672
["Rebel" by Kelsey Lu playing]

29:17.756 --> 29:19.007
[indistinct chatter]

29:19.090 --> 29:21.259
[man] We whose names are underwritten,

29:21.342 --> 29:25.847
do assure the world that the poems
specified on the following page,

29:25.930 --> 29:29.392
were, as we verily believe,
written by Phillis,

29:29.476 --> 29:33.563
a young Negro girl,
who was but a few years since,

29:33.646 --> 29:37.233
brought an uncultivated barbarian
from Africa.

29:38.109 --> 29:45.116
âª Rebel was your middle name âª

29:45.950 --> 29:49.704
âª When you were a young girl âª

29:49.788 --> 29:54.042
[Jeffers] When we look
at Phillis Wheatley's poetry,

29:55.376 --> 29:57.587
she is pushing back

29:57.670 --> 30:02.050
against this attitude
that she is less than.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.552
âª Times have really, really changed âª

30:04.636 --> 30:06.304
âª Changed âª

30:06.971 --> 30:11.893
She thought there was
nothing wrong with her.

30:13.102 --> 30:16.314
âª You don't really get to walk awayâ¦ âª

30:16.397 --> 30:20.235
[Morgan] What Phillis Wheatley is doing,
is very dangerous.

30:20.735 --> 30:24.280
I mean, what's at stake
is the entire colonial economy.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.908
It needs Black labor.

30:26.991 --> 30:31.037
That's what it needs.
It does not need or want Black art.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.039
âª Is it always gonna stay the sameâ¦ âª

30:33.122 --> 30:36.376
[Morgan] "If we concede
that Black women can produce art,

30:37.544 --> 30:40.213
what else do we have to concede?"

30:40.296 --> 30:42.757
âª â¦do you? âª

30:42.841 --> 30:48.596
âª Who will be the ones
To walk away with you? âª

30:48.680 --> 30:51.516
âª Time should really, really change âª

30:51.599 --> 30:53.935
âª Change âª

30:54.435 --> 31:00.483
âª Yet they always stay
The same way to you âª

31:00.567 --> 31:06.281
âª You don't really get
To walk away, do you? âª

31:06.364 --> 31:12.787
âª Who will be the ones
To walk away with you? âª

31:16.291 --> 31:17.417

31:17.500 --> 31:20.628
[Sonia Sanchez]
You, enigmatic woman exploding

31:20.712 --> 31:26.801
From clouds and intestines, riverbanks,
kneecaps, veins and horizons

31:26.885 --> 31:29.220
Tongues embroidered with eyelashes

31:29.304 --> 31:31.347
You burn in my throat

31:31.431 --> 31:33.099
I walk your footsteps
Singing

31:33.182 --> 31:35.018
You are here, you are there

31:35.101 --> 31:36.895
You will never go away

31:44.485 --> 31:46.571
Your lips taste of the sea

31:46.654 --> 31:48.823
The years dusty with herstory

31:48.907 --> 31:50.825
Anticipate light

31:50.909 --> 31:52.702
Your hands riot with pain

31:52.785 --> 31:54.329
Collapse in new prayer

31:54.412 --> 31:55.872
Touch this Western stained

31:55.955 --> 31:59.792
Glass where ghosts
commit themselves to military blood

32:00.460 --> 32:03.463
If we merge mercy with might

32:03.546 --> 32:05.214
And might with right

32:05.798 --> 32:09.135
Then love becomes our legacy

32:09.218 --> 32:13.097
And change our children's birthright

32:13.181 --> 32:15.433
So let us leave behind a country

32:15.516 --> 32:17.602
Better than the one we were left with

32:17.685 --> 32:20.104
Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest

32:20.188 --> 32:23.691
We will raise this wounded world
into a wondrous one

32:23.775 --> 32:27.236
We will rise
from the gold-limbed hills of the west

32:27.320 --> 32:29.614
We will rise from the windswept northeast

32:29.697 --> 32:32.408
Where our forefathers
first realized revolution

32:32.492 --> 32:36.412
We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities
of the Midwestern states

32:36.496 --> 32:38.373
We will rise from the sun-baked south

32:38.456 --> 32:39.666
We will rebuild

Seventy years in these folks' world

32:48.383 --> 32:51.135
I say "Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes ma'am!"

32:52.178 --> 32:53.429
For workin's sake

32:54.347 --> 32:57.141
Iâm too proud to bend and
Too poor to break

32:57.850 --> 32:59.686
So [chuckles]

32:59.769 --> 33:00.645
I laugh!

33:02.021 --> 33:03.439
Until my stomach ache

33:04.607 --> 33:06.150
When I think about myself

33:07.151 --> 33:09.904
My folks can make me split my side

33:10.697 --> 33:12.198
I laugh so hard

33:12.281 --> 33:13.157
[laughs]

33:13.241 --> 33:14.826
I nearly died

33:15.827 --> 33:19.372
The tales they tell sound just like lying

33:20.164 --> 33:22.375
They grow the fruit but eat the rind

33:22.959 --> 33:24.460
[soft chuckle]

33:24.544 --> 33:25.378
I laugh

33:25.461 --> 33:26.713
[laughs]

33:27.714 --> 33:29.173
Until I start to cry

33:30.174 --> 33:31.801
When I think about myself

33:32.385 --> 33:36.597
It could and did derive
From living on the ledge of death

[Jeffers] When we think
about white supremacy,

34:11.299 --> 34:13.176

34:13.259 --> 34:15.636
you see the filth.

34:16.721 --> 34:20.975
[choral music continues]

34:21.059 --> 34:25.396
There is a myth
about the founding of this country.

34:27.940 --> 34:34.155
People want to erase American history
as it truly was.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.286
White supremacy has been embedded

34:40.953 --> 34:44.707
in this country since its founding.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.168
[ominous music playing]

34:49.003 --> 34:51.756
[sighs] You really want
to talk about Thomas Jefferson?

34:52.423 --> 34:53.591
Okay.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.177
Thomas "Contradiction" Jefferson.
[chuckles]

34:56.260 --> 34:58.763
There are few people I despise more.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.184
[chuckling] Thomas Je--

35:04.143 --> 35:05.895
Thomas Jeffersonâ¦

35:07.980 --> 35:09.440
[laughs]

35:09.524 --> 35:11.275
Thomas Jefferson was full of shit.

35:12.610 --> 35:19.033
He was someone who was very well aware
of the atrocities that existed in slavery.

35:19.117 --> 35:23.746
He wasn't willing to let go of that divide
because of what slavery did forâ¦

35:25.164 --> 35:26.082
for him.

35:27.542 --> 35:32.338
[Kendi] On the one hand,
he opposed slavery.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.092
But then on the other hand,
he opposed abolition.

35:37.593 --> 35:42.682
And so he would speak out against slavery,
particularly earlier in his career.

35:43.724 --> 35:47.937
He'd also speak out against people
trying to bring the end of slavery!

35:48.020 --> 35:53.609
[Anderson] That's the paradox
that sits right at the core of America.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.280
You say freedom, but you're an enslaver.

35:57.363 --> 36:00.867
You see, I must write
the Declaration of Independence.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.703
[Vanee] As kids, we're taught
to love Thomas Jefferson,

36:03.786 --> 36:07.665
because of all he did for this country,
but he's a villain to somebody.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.791
Mr. Jeffersonâ¦

36:08.875 --> 36:11.210
[Vanee] When we only talk
about one side of it,

36:11.294 --> 36:12.920
that villainhood is erasedâ¦

36:14.422 --> 36:17.341
So Thomas Jefferson
is still highly romanticized.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.011
[Jefferson] What's the matter?

36:21.470 --> 36:22.889
Master, I'm scared.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.016
Of what?

36:27.810 --> 36:29.645
[Jefferson] Interracial mixing

36:29.729 --> 36:33.399
is a degradation to which
no lover of his country,

36:33.482 --> 36:36.027
no lover of excellence
of the human character,

36:36.110 --> 36:37.904
can innocently consent.

36:38.487 --> 36:41.407
To this, I have a great aversion.

36:42.658 --> 36:45.036
[unsettling music playing]

36:45.119 --> 36:50.333
Thomas Jefferson
spoke so poorly on Black women,

36:50.416 --> 36:52.960
talking about how unattractive they were.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.047
I think at one point
he likened them to orangutans.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.965
But he couldn't get enough
of Sally Hemings.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.426
How many children
did he have by that woman?

37:00.509 --> 37:02.094
He consistentlyâ¦

37:04.263 --> 37:05.473
raped

37:06.724 --> 37:09.810
Sally Hemings, who was a teenage slave.

37:12.146 --> 37:14.315
That's Thomas Jefferson.

37:14.398 --> 37:18.194
Espousing the language of democracy,

while he is breeding

[Dr. Stephanie Jones-Rogers]
These white men, like Jefferson,

37:36.295 --> 37:39.757
rationalized sexual violence
perpetrated against Black women

37:39.840 --> 37:42.385
by saying that
it wasn't sexual violence at all.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.066
[Roberts] One of the most powerful myths
about Black women

37:57.149 --> 37:59.485
that came out of the slavery era,

37:59.568 --> 38:02.196
was the icon of the Black Jezebel.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.700
This was supposed to be a Black woman

38:05.783 --> 38:09.495
who was completely controlled
by her sexual appetites.

38:09.578 --> 38:14.417
She was innately predisposed
to always be hypersexual,

38:14.500 --> 38:16.544
and want to engage with sex.

[growls]

38:50.161 --> 38:54.123
[Jones-Rogers] By constructing Black women
as promiscuous, they can say,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.834
"Well, they wanted it."

"Well, they came on to me,

that has become so part of the fabric,

39:11.974 --> 39:16.604
that I'm not even sure creators realize
that that's what they are invoking.

39:16.687 --> 39:21.233
We see that even with the way that people
talk about Black girls as being "fast."

39:22.318 --> 39:25.321

you cannot send mixed signals

âª I see her soul rising

We have to understand that sexual violence
was fundamental to violence of slavery.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.136
The culture of slavery was a violent one.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.556
And sexual violence
was a part of that culture.

You are considered unrapeable in slavery,

[Vanee] There were so many different ways
Black women were violated

40:14.787 --> 40:19.625

as enslaved people different,

and makes the scholarship
surrounding their struggles different.

in which she describes
what Black enslaved mothers went through.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.392
[wood creaking]

43:26.145 --> 43:30.274
[Jacobs] I suffered for air
even more than for light.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.361
But I was not comfortless.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.284
I heard the voices of my children.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.457
There was joy,

43:46.540 --> 43:48.709
and there was sadness in the sound.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.962
It made my tears flow.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.256
[sobs softly]

43:56.592 --> 44:01.096
I lived in that little dismal hole

Reader, my story ends with freedom.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.654
[haunting music playing]

44:17.821 --> 44:22.117
[Jacobs] I have not written my experiences
in order to attract attention to myself.

44:25.496 --> 44:30.501
It would have been more pleasant to me
to have been silent about my own history,

44:30.584 --> 44:32.628
but I want to add my testimony.

44:37.132 --> 44:40.678
I do earnestly desire
to arouse the women of the North

44:40.761 --> 44:44.848
to the condition
of two million women at the South,

44:44.932 --> 44:46.767
still in bondage,

44:46.850 --> 44:48.394
suffering what I suffered.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.523
And most of them far worse.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.275
I want to convince
the people of the free states

44:55.359 --> 44:57.319
what slavery really is.

44:59.154 --> 45:02.324
[haunting music continues]

45:08.706 --> 45:12.251
[Jackson] The dominant
slave narratives in the United States

45:12.334 --> 45:14.795
was one that did not include women.

45:14.878 --> 45:18.757
Harriet Jacobs is the first,
and I don't think that you have

45:18.841 --> 45:23.011
a wave of Black women
telling their stories as enslaved women

45:23.095 --> 45:26.140
without Harriet Jacobs
opening up that door

45:26.223 --> 45:28.308
and allowing
for some of those conversations,

45:28.392 --> 45:31.979
particularly those hard,
difficult conversations, to take place.

45:32.062 --> 45:35.107
[pensive music playing]

45:37.317 --> 45:40.112
[Morgan] Jacobs telling her story
is really important,

45:40.195 --> 45:42.072
because if she didn't tell her story,

45:42.656 --> 45:48.495
we wouldn't understand the way
sexual predation was built in

45:48.579 --> 45:51.707
to this system
that was allegedly about work.

45:52.958 --> 45:57.504
And ironically, historians, they assumed
it was written by a white woman,

45:57.588 --> 46:01.383
by an abolitionist,
because they felt like it was tooâ¦

46:01.467 --> 46:05.888
[sighs] â¦dramatic, the story of her life,
that it couldn't have been real.

46:07.347 --> 46:09.475
Women like Harriet Jacobs,

46:09.558 --> 46:13.270
they know that the archive
is trying to eliminate them.

46:13.353 --> 46:17.399
They know that their stories
are not supposed to be told.

46:18.192 --> 46:20.402
So when they tell their story,

46:21.236 --> 46:23.906
it is crucial that we pay attention to it.

46:23.989 --> 46:27.367
[tense music playing]

46:28.786 --> 46:31.622
[woman 1] The creation
of a hostile environment,

46:31.705 --> 46:36.210
with or without physical contact,
is sexual harassment.

46:36.919 --> 46:41.173
[woman 2] I can't even explain
how I felt, even now.

46:41.256 --> 46:43.008
There's no way of telling

46:43.091 --> 46:46.261
whether I would have even been able
to be sitting here now,

46:46.345 --> 46:48.222
telling you what happened.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.808
[Porsha Olayiwola] At any given time,
and in any given space,

46:50.891 --> 46:52.100
I, as a Black woman,

46:52.184 --> 46:55.354
can suffer from racism, sexism,
homophobia, classism!

46:55.437 --> 46:57.940
I can be raped, beat, be burned alive,

46:58.023 --> 46:59.691
and no one, not a single soul,

46:59.775 --> 47:02.528
will look up to acknowledge
my absence from this universe

47:02.611 --> 47:05.823
because I am insignificant,
because I am a Black woman!

47:05.906 --> 47:07.157
[rapping] Try being a lady?

47:07.241 --> 47:08.992
You mean you want me
To act catty and shady

Degrade me, trade me

Use me as your trophy
So that you can parade me

Use my vagina to only birth babies

47:16.500 --> 47:19.753
[Tarana Burke] What started as a simple
exchange of empathy between survivors,

47:19.837 --> 47:21.880
has now become a rallying cry.

47:23.632 --> 47:25.759
They were simply trying to be heard

47:25.843 --> 47:28.637
and trying to be seen and believed.

47:30.305 --> 47:33.684
[Anita Hill] We deserve better systems,
we deserve better attention,

47:33.767 --> 47:38.772
we deserve leadership that will call out
and acknowledge this problem.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.440
I stand here

47:41.316 --> 47:45.028
as a survivor of sexual
and domestic violence.

47:46.530 --> 47:49.366
[Morgan] Harriet Jacobs, ultimately,

47:49.449 --> 47:53.579
her freedom was purchased for her.

47:55.455 --> 47:58.083
And Harriet Jacobs is really angered

47:58.166 --> 48:00.460
that she has to be given her freedom

48:00.544 --> 48:04.131
through the intervention
of white abolitionists.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.383
[robust music playing]

48:10.053 --> 48:14.433
[Jackson] Most of the time, when I talk
about abolitionists in my classroom,

48:14.516 --> 48:19.438
they think of kind, white people
that made this great sacrifice

48:19.521 --> 48:21.481
and they're not completely wrong.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.942
But when I think of the abolitionists,

48:24.026 --> 48:27.863
I think of Black men and Black women
that were courageous

48:27.946 --> 48:29.781
and did incredible things.

48:33.076 --> 48:36.038
I think of them
as the center of the movement,

48:36.121 --> 48:40.792
and really white allyship
and white abolitionists as the periphery.

48:43.211 --> 48:46.757
Unfortunately, people aren't going
to listen to minorities

48:46.840 --> 48:50.469
until they have a majority figure
speak for them or alongside them.

48:50.552 --> 48:52.220
So we needed white abolitionists.

48:52.304 --> 48:54.640
However, it didn't stop them
from being problematic.

48:54.723 --> 48:57.643
[foreboding music playing]

49:00.145 --> 49:04.775
[Vanee] There were white abolitionists
who were in this school of thought where,

49:04.858 --> 49:06.234
"Yes, slavery is morally wrong,

49:06.318 --> 49:09.488
but I also don't feel
like Black people are equal to me."

49:11.156 --> 49:13.700
[Lincoln] Even when you cease
to be slaves,

49:13.784 --> 49:18.288
you're yet far removed from being placed
on an equality with the white race.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.999
Whether this is right or wrong,

49:21.833 --> 49:23.919
I need not discuss.

49:25.462 --> 49:29.758
We have this idea of Lincoln
as the great emancipator.

49:29.841 --> 49:32.469
-[announcer] Abraham Lincoln!
-[crowd cheering]

49:32.552 --> 49:35.722
[Jackson] Because he abolished
the institution of slavery,

49:35.806 --> 49:38.100
people hold him in very high regard.

quarterbacks starting against each other

49:41.186 --> 49:42.646

Fittingly, February 12th
is Abe Lincoln's birthday.

49:46.274 --> 49:49.444
[Jackson] But if you were to have
a conversation with Lincoln

49:49.528 --> 49:50.529
in the 19th century,

49:50.612 --> 49:53.407
you would probably be like,
"This dude is low-key racist."

49:54.658 --> 49:57.953
[Lincoln] I, as much as any other man,

49:58.036 --> 50:00.831
am in favor of having
the superior position

50:00.914 --> 50:03.166
assigned to the white race.

50:04.751 --> 50:07.629
[Vanee] He is painted often as a figure

50:07.713 --> 50:11.466
who saw the moral wrongs of slavery,
but let's be clear.

50:12.175 --> 50:13.468
He was just anti-slavery

50:13.552 --> 50:16.096
because of how he felt
the economy could benefit

50:16.179 --> 50:18.432
from moving away from slavery.

50:20.058 --> 50:22.144
[Jones-Rogers] We need to look
at all of what he said,

50:22.227 --> 50:24.688
not just what he said
in the Emancipation Proclamation.

50:25.313 --> 50:31.111
If we do that, then we realize that
Abraham Lincoln is a perplexing character,

50:31.194 --> 50:34.156
and especially in the history
of Black people in America.

50:34.239 --> 50:37.534
Look, I'm half Abraham Lincoln, soâ¦

50:37.617 --> 50:39.828

50:39.911 --> 50:41.496
Well, no, but, ehâ¦

50:41.580 --> 50:46.043
Most of history has centered white men,
very much so,

50:46.126 --> 50:49.463
and has made them sort of like
the great white hope.

50:49.546 --> 50:52.340
They are the deliverer or the emancipator.

50:53.425 --> 50:57.137
It's problematic because
it robs Black people of their agency,

50:57.220 --> 51:02.017
it robs them of all the contributions
that they gave to the movement.

[Jackson] Black abolitionists
are the first abolitionists.

53:02.929 --> 53:06.308
No one needed to tell enslaved people,
"You know what, slavery is wrong."

53:06.391 --> 53:08.476
"You know, this is bad for you." [laughs]

53:08.560 --> 53:09.436
They knew that.

53:09.519 --> 53:12.939
They knew that, and they're the first
to speak out about their grievances

53:13.023 --> 53:16.610
and about, you know,
the evils of this institution.

53:17.277 --> 53:21.865
And I think it's important to show
that, like, Black people freed themselves.

53:23.783 --> 53:25.660
But the white savior trope

53:25.744 --> 53:29.164
allows white people
to imagine Black people as children,

53:29.247 --> 53:31.583
and to say, "We're uplifting you."

53:31.666 --> 53:34.669
"We're developing you
as any parent would a child."

53:35.670 --> 53:38.089
But Black people are like,

"This is not a war of abolition,

[Vanee] Black progress is so terrifying

56:27.342 --> 56:30.553
to white Americans,
that they will do anything

56:32.055 --> 56:34.474
to harness power they thought was lost.

56:42.649 --> 56:47.112
[Jones-Rogers] White men saw Black men's
exercise of citizenship rights

56:47.195 --> 56:48.613
as a threat.

56:49.781 --> 56:53.076
And so they immediately begin to construct

56:53.159 --> 56:57.622
a very powerful mythology
around the Black man,

56:57.705 --> 57:04.129
who at all times had the ravishing
and rape of white women on their minds.

57:09.384 --> 57:11.428
[Gates] Racist ideas take root

57:11.511 --> 57:13.847
if they can connect
with something personal.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.723
With something emotional.

57:18.226 --> 57:24.441
By connecting that idea
of protecting the women in your community,

57:24.524 --> 57:27.193
to this alleged threat of Blackness,

57:28.319 --> 57:32.949
you transform racist violence into virtue.

57:34.200 --> 57:35.285
[screams]

57:35.368 --> 57:37.078
And when you do that,

57:37.162 --> 57:40.582
it justifies all kinds
of horrific actions.

57:40.665 --> 57:43.668
[somber music playing]

58:02.812 --> 58:04.898
[Kendi] In the early 1890s,

58:04.981 --> 58:06.900
lynchings were at their height,

58:06.983 --> 58:12.489
and the justifications for why
so many Black people were being lynched,

58:12.572 --> 58:15.575
was because
of what those Black people did wrong.

58:18.369 --> 58:21.998
[Cunningham] It was not just about
the person who was hanging on the tree

58:22.081 --> 58:25.919
who was being punished
for whatever crime, usually invented,

58:26.002 --> 58:28.004
that they often did not do.

58:28.838 --> 58:32.800
The act of lynching
was also there to inflict terror,

58:32.884 --> 58:35.803
lest any of us
want to be hanging from a tree too.

58:37.055 --> 58:41.643
That we were to all be able
to look at that image and understand

58:42.435 --> 58:46.981
that we should never cross the line
and that we should stay in our place.

58:47.690 --> 58:49.275
[police officer shouting]

58:50.693 --> 58:52.195
Get on the ground!

58:52.278 --> 58:53.738
Get on the ground!

58:55.532 --> 58:56.950
[officer] What's wrong with you?

58:57.033 --> 58:59.202
[panting]

58:59.285 --> 59:00.453
[handcuffs rattling]

59:01.329 --> 59:05.375
White supremacist powers
created those stereotypes

59:05.458 --> 59:07.377
as a way to put fear in people.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.379
[somber music continues]

59:09.462 --> 59:13.383
[Bush] If you make us the threat,
then you remove our humanity.

59:17.345 --> 59:21.057
These are intentional choices
to hold us back.

59:22.475 --> 59:25.270
âª Your life, would you risk that?
These kids never been bad âª

59:25.353 --> 59:27.397
âª Sixteen, run around with a big strap âª

59:27.480 --> 59:28.731
âª Gone, how many diedâ¦?

59:28.815 --> 59:31.317
[Roberts] The criminalization
of Black people

59:31.401 --> 59:35.238
has been an essential part
of white supremacy in America.

59:35.780 --> 59:38.783
It is a very powerful way

59:38.866 --> 59:45.373
for white people to explain
why it's important for a white power elite

59:45.456 --> 59:48.251
to control and contain Black communities.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.880
[Sabonjian] These guys have been in and
out of trouble so much you'd fill a book,

59:52.964 --> 59:56.426
but unfortunately we have to handle
these characters like daffodils,

59:56.509 --> 59:58.344
instead of the bums that they are,

59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.139
where we could throw them in a jail
where they belong.

01:00:01.222 --> 01:00:02.807
[chanting] Black lives matter!

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:05.351
[Rudy Giuliani] Why aren't they classified
as a terrorist group?

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.729
Just because they're Black
and nobody can say it?

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:11.024
Stop the nonsense. These are killers,
people who hate white people.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:14.027
Those ideas about "crime"
and "Black" and "race,"

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.446
become ingrained
in the American imagination.

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:18.865
Everybody that lives
with the colored has to move.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:19.782
[interviewer] Why?

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.868
Because you're not safe
walking the streets at night.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.202
You cannot leave the house.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:28.416
When we think about how criminals
are represented in the media,

01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:32.295
they tend to be people of color
and specifically Black men.

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:34.756
[man] Horton broke into our home.

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:38.051
For 12 hours,
I was beaten, slashed and terrorized.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:40.970
He was serving a life term
without the possibility of a parole

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.056
when Governor Dukakis
gave him a few days off.

01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:46.726
[Dylann Roof] Black people
are killing white people every day.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.814
They rape white women--
100 white women a day.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.816
âª He say it's a long story âª

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.401
âª Just know these youths

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.319
âª So tell me nowâ¦ âª

01:00:56.402 --> 01:00:58.988
[Reagan] You're familiar enough
with the statistics.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:00:59.906
[officer] Police!

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.784
[Reagan] Crime is an American epidemic.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:06.663
From these statistics, a portrait emerges.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:10.583
The portrait is that
of a stark, staring face.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.587
A face that belongs
to a frightening reality of our time.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.839
The face of a human predator.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.842
The face of the habitual criminal.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:24.222
Nothing in nature
is more cruel and more dangerous.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.019
There are ways to criminalize people
without it being in their face.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.647
[Hillary Clinton] They are not
just gangs of kids anymore.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:36.234
They are often the kinds of kids
that are called super predators.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:38.361
No conscience, no empathy.

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:39.946
First we have to join together

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:44.534
to ensure the drug dealers
are punished swiftly, surely and severely.

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:48.037
Crime becomes a code word

01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:51.207
for Black, for race.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.709
-[grunts]
-[gunshot]

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.424
[Cunningham]
The invention of Black criminality

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:03.302
is by such intentional design,

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.681
that it pervades all of culture.

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:07.932
Teenage killers

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:09.809
the homicide rate for juveniles

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.854
now has surpassed
the rate for adults in this countryâ¦

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:14.814
[reporter] Kids that once stole hubcaps

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.607
now rape and murder.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:20.778
[Jackson] Racist ideas
get reinforced over and over again

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:25.908
by what we see on TV,
what we see on the news.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:30.288
Commercials, film,
social media, you name it.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.958
And a lot of those ideas are silent.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:38.045
They're sort of subtle
because they're cloaked in, you know,

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.839
fancy dressing and disguise.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.132

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:42.800
[screaming]

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:49.098
[Gates] By the time
that we start to get to like the 1930s,

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.934
it is sort of socially unacceptable
to just, you know,

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.562
like be lynching
Black folks on camera, right?

01:02:54.645 --> 01:02:59.942
But what we get is still the invocation
of aspects of Blackness

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.570
even when you don't have
Black characters present.

01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:05.615
-[growling]

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.911
[Gates] In cinema,
you're not bound in reality.

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:13.122
You can make the villain as big and black,

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.708
and powerful and horrible
as you want them to be.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.293
[screams in terror]

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:18.753
Shut up, you freak!

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:20.671
Julius, you--

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.423
I said shut up!

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.300
[Gates] The reason that it works,

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:27.136
the reason that
it's legible to us as audiences,

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.015
is because we've already been trained
in stereotypes about Blackness

01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:35.645
that we may not even realize that
we are bringing in our viewing practices.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:38.731
[officer] You need
to disperse immediately!

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.691
[reporter] Two things
happened here last night.

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:43.736
One was the protest
for that slain teenager,

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.615
the second was lawlessness on fire
and out of control.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:51.160
North of St. Louis,
thieves ruled the night.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:55.706

Hands up, don't shoot!

["Follow the Leader"
by Devon Gilfillian playing]

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:03.005
Black people
are no more violent or dangerous

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.674
than any other group of people.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:10.388
But we are taught
the face of violence is Black,

01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:12.974
causing us to overlook
the white individuals

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:14.725
who engage in violence,

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:19.021
because apparently,
they don't have the face of violence.

[Kendi] Widespread poverty
and access to guns

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:32.493
better explain violence than race.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:38.040
But we are taught
that white violence is self-defense.

the potential violence is extraordinary.

And merely running,

01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:00.873
he becomes bestial
in the minds of these white men.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:05.169
These so-called innocuous ideas,

01:06:05.252 --> 01:06:08.881
they have this power
to infect the minds of people,

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:12.301
who then use them and twist them

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:16.305
to justify the massacre of Black people.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.689
[Benjamin] If we want to be fancy,
we could call it "cultural narratives."

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:29.193
I call it just straight-up lies
that people tell themselves

01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:35.324
in order to justify the maintenance
of these policies and these inequalities.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:40.329
Lynching was a reaction,
a racist reaction,

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.498
to Black folks doing well.

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.589
Ida B. Wells looked at the stories,

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:54.260
and the data that was being produced
to justify lynching and said,

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:57.346
"No, I'm gonna collect my own data."

01:07:03.602 --> 01:07:06.147
[Wells] If the Southern people,
in defense of their lawlessness,

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:07.940
would tell the truth about lynching,

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.777
there would not be now
the necessity for this defense.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:16.907
But when they intentionally, maliciously,
and constantly belie the record,

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:21.120
then the Negro must give to the world
his side of the awful story.

[man] Whoo!

[gunshot]

[plaintive music playing]

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.756
[Wells, voice breaking]
A finer, cleaner man than he,

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.175
never walked the streets of Memphis,

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.803
yet he was murdered
with no more consideration

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.513
than if he had been a dog.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:07.309
This is what opened my eyes
to what lynching really was,

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:12.314
an excuse to get rid of Negroes
who were acquiring wealth and property

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.401
and thus, keep the race terrorized.

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.445
[purposeful music playing]

01:09:27.079 --> 01:09:30.040
[Wells] The more I studied the situation,
the more I was convinced

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:33.335
that the Southerner
had never gotten over his resentment

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:37.464
that the Negro was no longer
his plaything, his servant,

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:39.592
and his source of income.

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.636
[purposeful music continues]

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.732
[Wells] During these years,
more than 10 thousand Negroes

01:09:54.815 --> 01:09:56.901
have been killed in cold blood,

01:09:56.984 --> 01:10:01.030
without the formality
of judicial trial and legal execution.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.241
The same record shows
that during all these years,

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.076
and for all these murders,

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.915
only three white men
have been tried, convicted and executed.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:14.501
[purposeful music continues]

01:10:21.842 --> 01:10:24.762
[Wells] The very frequent inquiry
made after my lectures

01:10:24.845 --> 01:10:26.972
by interested friends is,

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.183
"What can I do to help the cause?"

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:31.769
The answer always is,

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:34.897
"Tell the world the facts."

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:39.526
[mournful music playing]

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:54.625
When it comes to telling our stories,

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:59.838
and forcing this country
to take an unflinching look at itself,

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:01.215
she is the originator.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:08.639
We can see those postcards of lynch mobs,

01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:10.599
and their wives and children

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:15.271
standing underneath
a Black body swinging from a tree,

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.107
and know that it's horrifying.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:20.985
But we can only do that,

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:26.573
because Ida B. Wells took it upon herself,
in the day and time when it was happening,

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:28.742
to make sure that we knew,

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:32.413
to make sure that we could not look away.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.712
[dramatic music playing]

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.797
[clamoring]

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.843
[woman] You just opened my car door,

01:11:45.926 --> 01:11:48.387
so you're threatening
to drag me out of my own car.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.638
Get out of the car!

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.849
-[woman] You gonna stun me?
-I'll light you up. Get out!

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.186
-Get down, stay! On your face!

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.564
-One, twoâ¦
-I am no threat to this officer.

01:11:58.647 --> 01:11:59.606
I've been threatened.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.526
-Watch the show, folks.
-My life is in danger! My lifeâ¦

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.487
For what? Every time you see me,
you wanna mess with me.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.114
I'm tired of it! This stops today.

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:09.491
[bystander]
He's not responsive right now, bro.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.534
Does he have a pulse?

01:12:10.617 --> 01:12:13.787
No, bro! Look at him,
he's not responsive right now, bro.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.748
-Check for a pulse.
-Bro, are you serious?

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.167
You gonna let him sit here
with that on his neck?

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.045
[dramatic music continues]

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.444
[Cunningham] Police violence
is modern day lynching.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:49.573
State violence against Black bodies,
inside and outside of prison cells,

01:12:49.656 --> 01:12:51.533
is lynching.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.744
It is a form of racial terror,

01:12:53.827 --> 01:12:56.538
meant not only
to punish the Black individual,

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.709
but to send a message
to all Black people, to stay in our place.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.467
Even as policing
and their techniques have evolved,

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.969
there is a single common thread.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:15.557

[loud cheering]

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.109
â¦there's a tidal wave back.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:29.363
A wall of white supremacy
that shows up and says, like,

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:31.949
"This far and no farther."

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:36.954

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.093
[Perry] The response to Black progress

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:52.636
is punishment.

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.138
[siren blaring]

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:55.806
[Perry] It's not articulated like that.

01:13:55.889 --> 01:13:59.226
It's articulated as problems of crime,
problems of drugs.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.061
But the reality is,

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:06.525
it's an effort to reassert
racial domination through "order."

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:11.405
This nation must make
an all-out effort to combat crime.

01:14:12.656 --> 01:14:14.867
Our country's laws must be respected.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.745
Order must be maintained.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.665
[Nixon] My friends,
let this message come through clear

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:23.167
from what I say tonight.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.379
The wave of crime
is not going to be the wave of the future

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.381
in the United States of America.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.593
The first responsibility of government

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.721
is law and order.

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:41.435
I am the law and order candidate.

01:14:41.518 --> 01:14:44.688
[crowd cheering and applauding]

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.484
[applause]

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:54.490
[Mike Wallace] When you read stories
about difficulties,

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:59.870
riots in Omaha, or Cleveland,
or Brooklyn, or Chicago, or whereverâ¦

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.372
I call them rebellions.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.041
-[Wallace] They're rebellions?
-Right.

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:06.752
[Wallace] And you--
you see nothing wrong with them?

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:10.839
I think that it is people
who are rebelling against a system

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.092
that has locked them
inside, tight, of ghettos,

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.844
that exploits and oppresses them,

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:19.806
and they have no means of redress
to break that system down.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.560
You have moved to destroy and disrupt,

01:15:24.102 --> 01:15:26.438
you have taken people away,

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.525
you have broken down their systems,

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.819
and you have called all that,
"civilization."

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:37.074
And we who have suffered at this,
are now saying to you,

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:40.410
"You are the killers of the dreams."

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.329
"You are the savages."

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:46.875
"Yes, it is you
who have always been uncivilized."

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.586
Civilize yourself.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:53.131
[gloomy music playing]

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:10.315
[Anderson] This nation
is drawn to the spectacular.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:13.318
Drawn to the flames.

01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:18.490
But we don't pay attention
to the kindling,

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:24.371
and the kindling are those policies
that are predicated on anti-Blackness.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.626
The denial of education, kindling.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:35.799
Unequal housing
and employment opportunities, kindling.

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:40.971
The hyper-policing
of Black communities, kindling.

[Vanee] Stop-and-friskâ¦

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.684

[Jeffers] Mass incarceration.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:58.905
[Cunningham] When you have policies,
structures, and institutions

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.491
that intentionally subjugate Black people,

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:06.330
you intentionally create communities
that can be continuously criminalized.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:07.873
And there's that thread again.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.751
[plaintive music playing]

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.094

[heartbeat]

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:32.981
[Kendi] When we think
of the history of racism in this country,

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:36.151
we're really thinking
of the history of power.

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:38.945
[unsettling music playing]

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.240
[Bush] Everything in our society

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:45.452
that has been used
to oppress Black people in this country,

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.246
it's so they can continue to keep power.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.458
The white elite.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.835
That's how they benefit.

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:56.129
They get to maintain their power.

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:02.552
[Cunningham] We are taught that power
is some kind of finite resource,

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:03.929
that it is a pie.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:08.892
The more I have, the less you have.
The more you have, the less I have.

01:18:13.313 --> 01:18:15.482
If your guiding principle is that,

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:20.862
whatever you have, keep it at all costs,
then you will do whatever you have to do.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:23.907
You will lie, you will cheat,
you will steal, you will kill,

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.701
to make sure you hold on to it.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:33.041
[evocative music playing]

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:55.814
[Dr. Angela Davis] The work
that ought to have been done

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:59.735
in the immediate aftermath of slavery,

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:04.406
the work of reorganizing, retooling,

01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:08.410
reconceptualizing the entire society,

01:19:09.202 --> 01:19:15.000
so that it might be possible
for previously enslaved individuals

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.419
to be free and equal,

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:20.088
that work was never done.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.882
[clamoring]

01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:23.633

[explosives going off]

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:31.266
[Jones-Rogers] I think that white people
are afraid of what will happen

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:34.186
if they put a mirror up to themselves.

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:40.358
They'll be able to see
that for generations, for centuries,

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:46.031
they have tormented and repressed
Black, brown and tan people.

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.950
They might not know
what to do with that history.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:51.161
There will be a "Then what?" question.

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:53.997
"Now that you know, then what?"

01:19:54.706 --> 01:19:57.250
They'll have to think about
whether they want to continue

01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:58.919
to live in that legacy.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:04.341
[Kendi] The heartbeat
of being racist is denial,

01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:10.388
is constantly looking for ways
to deny the persistence of racism.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:19.397
In order to address the way
in which racism is-- is baked in,

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:25.320
actually requires an active disposition.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.323
And that is anti-racism.

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:40.126
[gentle music playing]

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.395
[Kendi]
People are constantly thinking about,

01:20:58.478 --> 01:21:00.856
if we create an anti-racist society,

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:03.942
what are they going to lose,

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:07.529
as opposed to what they're going to gain.

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:17.038
[Perry] If you want an effective
social network of human beings,

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.457
an effective society,

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:23.712
keeping your heel on the back
of a portion of the community,

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.505
is probably not the best move.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:28.258
[gentle music continues]

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.805
[Jones-Rogers] I don't know what
it'll look like, but I know it's possible

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.392
because someone, some series of people,

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.394
put the system together
in the first place.

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:42.355
And if they can put the system together
in the first place,

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.149
then we can undo the system.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.859
[inaudible]

01:21:45.942 --> 01:21:49.696
[Cooper] It isn't about a better idea
that allows you to love your neighbor.

01:21:49.779 --> 01:21:52.198
That's not what we're talking about.

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:53.950
If all "anti-racist" means,

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.953
is that you personally
don't dislike people of color,

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:02.792
how does that make my life any better
because you personally don't dislike me?

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:08.506
But if, after you have reckoned with that,
you then go out and say,

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.343
"But how has our structural dislike
of these people,

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:14.220
our structural disregard of these people,

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:16.431
made it harder for them to actually live?"

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:19.267
Then, now we're talking.
Now we're cooking with grease.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:22.395
[evocative music playing]

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.690
[Jackson]
Black people know what they want.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:30.070
They have ideas about what freedom
and liberation will look like.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:35.283
And it doesn't look
like this radical utopia.

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.203
It looks a lot
like the world that white people live in.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:41.539
[chuckling] The world that
white people living in never question.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.792
[percussive music playing]

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.297
I love being Black.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.800
I thank God every day
that He made me Black.

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:53.259
I love my Black husband.

01:22:53.343 --> 01:22:55.303
I love the Black baby we're gonna have.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:56.763
I love my Black family.

01:22:56.846 --> 01:22:58.807
I love my Black neighbor, Miss Janet.

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:00.433
I love my Black church.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.102
I love my Black music.

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:04.896
I love all of the things
that Blackness has given America,

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.649
whether or not America acknowledges it.

01:23:07.732 --> 01:23:11.987
âª Alive âª

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:15.991
âª Alive âª

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:21.830
âª If the sun decide to rise
I'm still alive âª

01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:23.039
[Williams] So tell me,

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:26.251
what is wrong with Black people?

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:28.962
Nothing.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.464
Nothing is wrong with Black people.

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.967
There is nothing wrong with Black people.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:38.054
You see how absolutely absurd it is.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.432
The only thing wrong with Black people

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:43.184
is that we think
something is wrong with Black people.

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:47.439
[rhythmic choral song plays]

01:24:00.326 --> 01:24:04.080
âª I'll rise âª

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:09.127
âª I'll rise âª

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:12.547
âª One breath at a time âª

01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:17.052
âª Go down but still alive âª

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:20.889
âª The master of my mind âª

01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:25.727
âª Still I rise âª

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:30.023
âª I'll rise âª

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:34.402
âª I'll rise âª

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:38.698
âª The sun decide to rise âª

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:43.286
âª I'm still alive âª

01:24:43.369 --> 01:24:47.373
âª Alive âª

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:51.127
âª Alive âª

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:56.132
âª If the sun decide to rise âª

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.969
âª I'm still alive âª

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:04.390
âª If the sun decide to rise âª

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:08.728
âª If the sun decide to rise âª

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:14.484
âª If the sun decide to rise âª

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:19.072
âª I'm still alive âª

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:21.324
[song fades to an evocative melody]

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.874
âª Blind man, send him my way âª

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.918
âª Blind man, send him my way âª

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.880
âª Blind man, send him my way âª

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.841
âª Blind man, send him my way âª

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:22.343
[syncopated rhythm begins]

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.939
[more rhythms layer]

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:44.008
[chorus vocalizes hauntingly]

01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:55.079
[song ends]

01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:00.543
[steady rhythm playing]

01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:18.144
[piano playing robustly]

01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:26.481
[song ends]
