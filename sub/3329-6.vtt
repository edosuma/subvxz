WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.295
Previously on Elementary...

00:08.300 --> 00:09.460
You work for Sherlock.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.262
She's not my partner.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.675
She's my protge.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.769
I realized it wasn't you
I was afraid of losing.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.448
It was our
relationship.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.449
The mechanics of it,
the give and the take.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.641
So I realized
I could do it again.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.682
Were you aware that
her records in the UK

00:23.720 --> 00:25.642
only date back
five years?

00:25.690 --> 00:27.419
Before then,
Kitty Winter didn't exist.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.813
You think that
Kitty needs help

00:28.860 --> 00:30.521
above and beyond
my mentorship?

00:30.560 --> 00:32.152
You read the same file I did.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.497
She's a rape victim.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.395
The training I'm attempting
to provide her is

00:35.430 --> 00:36.522
the same training
I provided to you.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.765
It is, in part, an
attempt to channel

00:38.800 --> 00:40.529
certain residual feelings
that she has

00:40.570 --> 00:41.764
into a productive skill.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.461
I want it-- I want every bit

00:43.510 --> 00:45.603
of what he's offered me,
of what he offered you.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.609
But if I've learned one thing,
it's that he can't pull it off.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.800
Not by himself,
anyway.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.806
What do you say, Watson?

00:51.850 --> 00:54.569
Will you help me?

00:58.850 --> 01:02.456
WATSON: So, did he behave
himself while I was gone?

01:02.490 --> 01:04.549
KITTY: That depends. Are you
talking about the frowny one

01:04.590 --> 01:07.457
with the hard shell,
or do you mean Clyde?

01:07.500 --> 01:09.297
Take your pick.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.297
Sherlock's good.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.730
He had me pretty busy
while you were in Denmark.

01:12.770 --> 01:14.761
(cell phone buzzes)

01:15.900 --> 01:16.867
What's up?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.538
Master beckons.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.846
"Go" the number two "Map Room,
39th Street Library, posthaste.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.646
Contact Rafael,
curator, upon arrival."

01:27.680 --> 01:30.547
I guess he needs
a map posthaste.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.410
It's fine, it's
brilliant, actually.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.815
He's been giving me
a lot more responsibility.

01:34.860 --> 01:37.829
The way I see it,
the chores are my tuition.

01:37.860 --> 01:38.827
(cell phone buzzes)

01:40.900 --> 01:43.869
Look, if you want
the benefit of my experience,

01:43.900 --> 01:45.891
he knows you see it that way.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.898
And he'll take advantage
if you let him,

01:47.940 --> 01:51.137
so, once in a while,
it's good to make him wait.

01:51.170 --> 01:53.570
I almost did last night.

01:53.610 --> 01:54.804
I had plans.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.603
I've gotten
to know this group

01:56.650 --> 01:58.242
at the coffee house
near the brownstone.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.747
We were gonna go for drinks.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.816
I think it's good that
you're making friends.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.216
Friends that are
not Sherlock.

02:06.220 --> 02:07.653
Well, he needed me,
so I dropped out.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.681
(cell phone chimes)

02:12.700 --> 02:14.190
"Know Kitty is with you.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.198
"Please remind that
her phone notifies sender

02:16.230 --> 02:17.822
when she has received
and read a text."

02:17.870 --> 02:19.269
(cell phone chimes)

02:19.300 --> 02:20.836
"As does yours."

02:20.870 --> 02:24.636
Enjoy your day,
Watson.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.736
So, I'm not here
to pick up a map?

02:28.780 --> 02:31.248
No, I was very clear
with Mr. Holmes.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.508
There was a robbery.

02:32.550 --> 02:34.177
I think it was
one of the guards.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.915
A man by the name
of Gerald Vogel.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.214
He didn't show up for
his shift last night.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.786
I tried calling him,
but he didn't answer.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.788
I checked his rounds from
the night before last,

02:41.820 --> 02:44.186
that's when I noticed
the maps were gone.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.198
Were the drawers like
this when you found them?

02:46.230 --> 02:47.299
No, I opened them.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.922
I'm still
going through them,

02:48.960 --> 02:51.428
but so far these are the drawers
the maps were taken from.

02:51.470 --> 02:52.630
Did you have
surveillance?

02:52.670 --> 02:54.262
Disabled.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.165
More reason for you
to suspect Mr. Vogel.

02:57.410 --> 03:00.277
I hope you don't
mind me asking,

03:00.310 --> 03:01.902
but, uh, why isn't
Mr. Holmes here?

03:01.940 --> 03:04.443
Miss Hudson specifically
recommended him.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.846
He's finishing up
some other business.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.986
I hope she conveyed to you
the importance of discretion.

03:10.020 --> 03:10.987
(chuckles nervously)

03:11.020 --> 03:12.453
I mean, if it got out

03:12.490 --> 03:13.912
that we couldn't keep
our own collection safe,

03:13.960 --> 03:16.929
private benefactors
would stop donating,

03:16.960 --> 03:18.928
a-and I know our insurer
would have plenty to say.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.928
Mr. Holmes and I are nothing
if not discreet.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.292
Good, because all we want

03:23.330 --> 03:26.299
is to find Gerald
and recover the maps.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.535
Provided he cooperates,
we won't press charges.

03:28.570 --> 03:29.969
You might be getting
ahead of yourself.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.934
Your missing guard
may be innocent.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.643
These, um, scratches
in the first few drawers,

03:36.680 --> 03:38.307
it looks like someone's tried
to pick the locks.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.341
But on this last drawer...

03:41.520 --> 03:43.488
...no scratches.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.544
Suggesting that
when he realized

03:44.590 --> 03:45.739
that his skills
weren't up to snuff,

03:45.790 --> 03:47.712
he went looking
for someone who had keys.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.728
I don't think your guard
is the thief,

03:49.760 --> 03:51.728
I think he's
just the helper.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.728
Wait, by "helper"
do you mean "accomplice"?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.320
Or do you think someone
forced Gerald to do it?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.962
There were other
guards on duty

03:58.000 --> 03:59.558
the night he went
missing, right?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.830
Of course.

04:01.870 --> 04:04.259
Look, if this turns out
not to be an inside job,

04:04.310 --> 04:07.473
I still hope you can
resolve this quietly.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.502
Your concern for Mr. Vogel
is quite touching.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.038
Wait, you're not calling
the police, are you?

04:18.090 --> 04:20.251
I'm calling Sherlock,
you should call the police.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.590
So, how did you know
to look in here?

05:05.630 --> 05:07.666
There were other guards
making their rounds

05:07.700 --> 05:09.361
the night of the robbery.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.731
Even though the thief
disabled the cameras,

05:11.770 --> 05:14.705
walking Mr. Vogel out at
gunpoint wasn't an option,

05:14.740 --> 05:18.107
so, whatever he did, he had
to do it quickly and quietly,

05:18.150 --> 05:20.118
and in here.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.710
So, he strangled him.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.718
Her first hidden corpse.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.388
You must be so proud.

05:26.420 --> 05:29.014
You jest,
but indeed I am.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.880
Can't put a price
on that kind of training.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.795
GREGSON: So, you said your
friend referred you

05:32.830 --> 05:34.627
to this curator?

05:34.660 --> 05:35.854
At first, she thought
it was a matter

05:35.900 --> 05:36.969
which could be
handled internally,

05:37.000 --> 05:38.126
but when it became
more than that,

05:38.170 --> 05:40.035
Kitty called me,
I called Watson.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.867
And Rafael called you.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.834
I must say, I
find it alarming

05:43.870 --> 05:46.839
that we were able to get here
before you and your men.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.438
We were called simultaneously.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.902
If you'd like,
I could share my analysis

05:49.950 --> 05:51.099
of midtown traffic patterns.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.744
We're good, thanks.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.111
Aanay, gave me
some time to make

05:55.150 --> 05:56.879
a few observations of my own.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.945
I've come to the conclusion
that much of this crime

05:58.990 --> 06:00.719
is smokescreen,

06:00.760 --> 06:04.059
unnecessary noise to cover
the thief's actual objective.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.490
So, you don't think he was
here to steal maps.

06:06.530 --> 06:08.896
I think he was here
to steal a map.

06:08.930 --> 06:12.559
Or at least I'm raising
that possibility.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.137
Before you got here,
he pointed out

06:15.170 --> 06:17.900
that most of these drawers_ were
chosen because of convenience.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.908
These are the first drawers
that one encounters

06:19.940 --> 06:22.807
upon entering this aisle and
are at an easy height to reach.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.570
That drawer, however, is the
very opposite of convenient.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.417
Only one map was removed.

06:28.450 --> 06:32.079
I submit that it alone was
the thief's intended prize.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.451
Do we have an inventory
of what's missing?

06:33.490 --> 06:35.458
Rafael!

06:38.460 --> 06:39.859
We recently created
a catalog

06:39.900 --> 06:42.198
of high-res scans
of our collection.

06:42.230 --> 06:45.097
This is the map that's gone
missing from the far drawer.

06:45.130 --> 06:49.806
"The County of King James,
Virginia, 1794."

06:49.840 --> 06:51.808
It's the only known copy.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.205
But it's not actually
the most valuable

06:53.240 --> 06:54.798
of the maps that were taken.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.808
How much are
we talking?

06:56.850 --> 06:57.669
We haven't appraised it
in some time,

06:57.710 --> 06:59.769
but I'd put it
in the $200,000 range.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.844
But the map taken
from that drawer there

07:00.880 --> 07:02.916
is worth twice that much.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.918
But you think this one
was the real target?

07:07.220 --> 07:09.859
WATSON: "On permanent loan
from Hollis Bray,

07:09.890 --> 07:11.528
October 1951."

07:11.560 --> 07:13.118
That name is familiar to you?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.129
Yeah, I've seen his name
on the walls of hospital wings.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.696
Obviously, he's
passed away now.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.789
But his family still runs
an active charity.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.707
If the map is on loan, it means
the Bray family still owns it.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.208
So perhaps one of them can tell
us what's so special about it.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.208
WOMAN: I don't think
anyone has thought

07:27.240 --> 07:31.802
about the things my granddad
loaned the library in decades.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.978
And can't imagine how anyone
even knew the map was there.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.885
The library recently
scanned its collection

07:36.920 --> 07:38.979
and made it available
on the Internet.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.988
So it's possible whoever stole
the map learned of its existence

07:41.020 --> 07:41.884
via their Web site.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.889
That's it, isn't it?

07:44.930 --> 07:46.488
Yes.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.953
Uh, my family is originally
from that part of Virginia.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.492
For someone who was just told
$200,000 was stolen from them,

07:52.540 --> 07:53.859
you don't seem
very concerned.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.869
I don't think
the number seems real.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.866
I only just learned
of this map's existence

07:58.910 --> 08:00.901
when you walked in here.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.601
So it's unlikely
you could tell us

08:02.650 --> 08:03.708
why the thief may
have targeted that map?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.900
I'm sorry, but it's obviously
not a treasure map.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.942
It's not like there was gold
buried in King James County.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.811
If there was, my granddad
would have dug it up

08:10.850 --> 08:12.613
a very long time ago.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.050
Perhaps your smokescreen
theory is wrong.

08:16.090 --> 08:17.580
Miss Bray, you have
relationships

08:17.630 --> 08:19.222
with several other
archives In the crty.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.921
To do your
philanthropic work, yes?

08:20.960 --> 08:23.167
Uh, yeah, lots. Why?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.168
Well, we first
learned of this case

08:25.200 --> 08:28.636
because the library was too
embarrassed to report the crime.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.638
The crime itself,
meanwhile, displays

08:30.670 --> 08:32.638
a degree of, uh,
discrimination,

08:32.680 --> 08:35.001
on the part of the thief,
a certain expertise.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.008
So, you think
he committed other thefts,

08:37.050 --> 08:38.904
but the victims
didn't come forward.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.316
It's possible such crimes
may provide vital data

08:41.350 --> 08:43.318
with which to catch him.

08:43.350 --> 08:45.318
Now, a friendly face,
such as yours,

08:45.350 --> 08:47.318
together with an assurance
from us

08:47.360 --> 08:49.316
that we will be_
as discreet as possmle,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.851
that might persuade other
organizations to talk.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.529
Of course, I'd be
happy to help.

09:00.970 --> 09:03.109
(doorbell rings)

09:10.380 --> 09:12.348
Kitty?

09:12.380 --> 09:14.041
I have some more
of Clyde's things.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.640
Uh, some toys, treats,
couple of cozies.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.885
Sherlock thought that
he might be needing them.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.888
Oh, that was
thoughtful, I guess.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.114
But I thought you were gonna try

09:22.160 --> 09:23.582
and meet your friends
again tonight.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.586
I was, but you know how it is.

09:25.630 --> 09:26.949
Duty calls.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.197
What does this have
to do with detective work?

09:30.230 --> 09:32.198
It's just one
of tonight's errands.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.733
He had some luck
with that Bray woman.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.192
She called some archives
and the like,

09:36.240 --> 09:38.060
got us some information
on other thefts.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.737
So I'm just off
to gather it up.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.270
What is Sherlock doing?

09:41.310 --> 09:44.040
When I left, he was waxing
his singlestick.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.142
Sorry, that's not a euphemism.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.147
He was literally...

09:48.180 --> 09:50.080
I know.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.384
There'll be other nights
for drinks.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.308
In the meantime,
Sherlock's data awaits.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.999
(rattling)

10:03.800 --> 10:05.768
What do you think
you're doing?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.097
I think I'm picking
the lock again.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.028
You keep doing this--
you ask me to come over

10:09.070 --> 10:10.867
and then you don't answer
the door when I ring.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.333
I mean-- why are you picking
the lock so noisily?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.336
Why not just announce
the position

10:15.380 --> 10:17.143
of your cranium
to an awaiting gunman.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.740
(sighs) What is it you
wanted to show me?

10:23.850 --> 10:25.010
Productive night?

10:25.050 --> 10:26.415
Exceedingly.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.418
If fortune is on our side,

10:28.460 --> 10:30.428
Captain Gregson and his finest
should be apprehending

10:30.460 --> 10:31.984
our killer as we speak.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.725
Kitty will be
apprising me presently.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.024
I take it all of this
helped you find him?

10:36.060 --> 10:38.028
"Know your enemy
as yourself," Watson.

10:38.070 --> 10:41.039
As I suspected when I asked
Margaret Bray for help,

10:41.070 --> 10:44.801
our thief is both
a specialist in his ﬁeld

10:44.840 --> 10:47.001
and a student of its past.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.009
Iidenﬁﬁed
three more archives,

10:50.050 --> 10:51.904
which I believe were robbed
by the same individual.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.372
In the days leading up
to each robbery,

10:53.420 --> 10:55.741
including the one
at the 39th Street Library,

10:55.780 --> 10:58.817
someone signed into the guest
log under the alias

10:58.850 --> 11:01.057
Ren Duchez.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.079
So, you think
the thief was using it

11:02.120 --> 11:03.451
to case out the locations.

11:03.490 --> 11:06.459
Duchez was a French
Re5istance member

11:06.490 --> 11:08.720
who stole the map
of Germany's Atlantic Wall,

11:08.760 --> 11:10.899
their fortifications along
the western coast of Europe.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.967
And this map was crucial to
the allied invasion at Normandy.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.264
It's kind of a strange
specialty for a thief, huh?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.439
Maps.
Not at all.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.075
In fact, all of history can
be viewed through the lens

11:21.110 --> 11:22.429
of who stole
whose maps.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.449
Each discovery, every war,
the rise and fall of empires,

11:25.480 --> 11:27.971
all turned _
on cartographic espionage.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.215
It is this intrigue
that creates their allure

11:30.250 --> 11:32.218
which fuels
the collectors' frenzy.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.854
Now, our thief
fancies himself

11:33.890 --> 11:35.255
a follower i_n_this
grand tradition,

11:35.290 --> 11:37.850
so_ it occurred to me--
he's either a collector himself

11:37.890 --> 11:40.950
or he's selling his wares
to other enthusiasts.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.968
Well, collectors don't tend
to get their hands dirty,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.228
so I'm guessing
it's a seller.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.498
I began with
the same assumption.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.293
He would _need somewhere
for his customers

11:47.340 --> 11:48.762
to receive their goods,
wouldn't he?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.165
A front business,
perhaps?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.166
We know he admires
Ren Duchez,

11:52.210 --> 11:54.428
so I searched for aptly
named enterprises, and...

11:57.150 --> 11:58.879
...voi|.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.447
A frame shop in Brooklyn called,
"Atlantic Wall Dcor."

12:01.480 --> 12:04.017
Now, that would not be
compelling in and of itself.

12:04.050 --> 12:07.019
But the owner of said shop,
Stuart Zupko,

12:07.060 --> 12:10.086
was once
a cartography student.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.358
Got his first burglary
conviction in 2007.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.494
It seems he's cultivated
himself a niche.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.725
(cell phone chimes)

12:19.100 --> 12:21.193
What is it?
It's Kitty.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.333
The police have indeed
found Mr. Zupko.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.258
Oh, that's a good
thing, isn't it?

12:31.280 --> 12:34.943
GREGSON: The good news is it
looks like Zupko was our guy.

12:34.980 --> 12:38.086
We found all the maps that
were taken from the library.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.519
Including the Bray map.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.450
It was the only one
that was laid out.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.458
Zupko must have been
standing here.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.822
Obviously, he was examining
the map when he was killed.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.350
Or displaying
it for a buyer.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.789
WATSON:
That would make sense.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.263
There are no signs
of a break-in.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.063
KITTY:
But if Sherlock was right,

12:53.100 --> 12:55.568
if the robbery at the
library really was

12:55.600 --> 12:57.136
all about
the Bray map,

12:57.170 --> 12:59.138
andifthaUs
what this is about,

12:59.170 --> 13:02.105
then why would Zupko's killer
leave the map behind?

13:05.210 --> 13:07.246
'Cause this is not the Bray map.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.182
It's a fake.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.221
KITTY:
Certainly looks real,
doesn't it?

13:20.260 --> 13:22.455
It helps that the paper
is the right age.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.991
It's about two and a quarter
centuries, give or take.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.998
But you're sure
that it's a fake.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.564
Mr. Holmes could tell
right away.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.568
Maps like that were engraved
on copper plates,

13:30.610 --> 13:33.078
and then they were printed
onto paper using a press.

13:33.110 --> 13:36.079
You can feel where the paper is
slightly raised where the ink is

13:36.110 --> 13:38.169
'cause that's where the
copper was carved away.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.576
The thing is-- someone washed
off a different image

13:40.620 --> 13:43.919
from that paper and then used
it to make their own forgery.

13:43.950 --> 13:46.339
Gonna have to take
your word for it.

13:48.220 --> 13:52.179
He determined that the ink
was produced in the 19405,

13:52.230 --> 13:54.858
a few years before
your grandfather loaned

13:54.900 --> 13:56.253
the library the map.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.494
I don't understand.

13:57.530 --> 14:00.499
Are you saying that
he gave them a fake?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.202
That it-it was fake all along?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.502
It's a possibility.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.338
Well, I don't know
what to say.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.349
Obviously, he wouldn't
have given it

14:10.380 --> 14:13.349
to the library
knowingly.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.871
What-what would he have
stood to gain?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.410
All right, just so
we're clear, Miss Bray,

14:17.450 --> 14:19.247
no one's trying to embarrass
you or your family.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.951
The reason we're
sharing this is--

14:20.990 --> 14:24.482
the last person to handle
that map is dead.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.157
There's a theory of evidence
that suggests

14:26.190 --> 14:28.158
that Stuart Zupko was
hired to steal it.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.327
And then when the buyer
realized it was a fake,

14:30.370 --> 14:31.962
they killed him.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.661
GREGSON: If we're right, the
buyer may still be looking

14:33.700 --> 14:37.033
for the real map, which was last
in your family's possession.

14:37.070 --> 14:39.971
Are you saying
that I'm in danger?

14:40.010 --> 14:42.308
I'm saying you should
keep your eyes open.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.308
If you see anything
out of the ordinary

14:44.350 --> 14:47.319
or if anyone tries
to contact you,

14:47.350 --> 14:49.341
you should call us.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.285
(door closes)

14:53.320 --> 14:55.311
Was I quiet enough for you?

14:56.590 --> 14:57.989
I picked the lock again.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.328
So you did.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.521
WATSON:
You asked me to come here,
so why do I get the feeling

15:02.560 --> 15:04.460
that I'm interrupting?

15:04.500 --> 15:07.094
We can now say with
reasonable certainty

15:07.140 --> 15:08.459
that Stuart Zupko
killed the guard

15:08.500 --> 15:10.104
at the 39th
Street Library.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.131
IfI am right that
he was in turn killed

15:12.170 --> 15:13.535
by one of his
map-obsessed customers,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.400
it behooves us to identify
them, does it not?

15:15.440 --> 15:17.977
Is she supposed
to be a map collector?

15:18.010 --> 15:19.443
I've spoken with
some of the city's

15:19.480 --> 15:20.412
more reputable
auction houses,

15:20.450 --> 15:21.439
and I have discovered

15:21.480 --> 15:23.186
that the Bray map was originally

15:23.220 --> 15:25.313
one plate from an atlas entitled

15:25.350 --> 15:27.489
Smythe's Virginia.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.353
Edward Smythe, the early
American surveyor

15:30.390 --> 15:32.381
who drew the maps, is
currently very much in vogue.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.295
Now, the process of
dismantling atlases

15:34.330 --> 15:36.457
and selling
their individual maps

15:36.500 --> 15:38.422
has long been common
amongst collectors.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.438
This, in turn, has created an
even more lucrative market

15:40.470 --> 15:42.438
for reassembling
the books.

15:42.470 --> 15:46.201
Okay, so how much is a restored
Smythe's Virginia worth?

15:46.240 --> 15:48.003
Far more_ than the
sum of its parts.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.200
Several million,
at least.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.571
So, if someone were close
to completing their copy...

15:53.620 --> 15:55.349
Would explain
why that person

15:55.380 --> 15:57.689
only really cared
about the Bray map.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.745
Now, there is a collector
named Austin Cornblatt.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.611
He's been trying to assemble
a copy of the atlas.

16:02.660 --> 16:06.050
He's bid very aggressively for
plates in several auctions.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.296
He could be a
Viable suspect.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.558
If not, he might
have some insights

16:08.600 --> 16:10.124
into others who've
sought them out.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.728
Well, still doesn't
explain the, um...

16:11.770 --> 16:13.533
Earlier this morning,

16:13.570 --> 16:15.367
I initiated a dialogue
with Mr. Cornblatt

16:15.400 --> 16:16.537
under false pretenses.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.437
You are currently
speaking with Amber1776,

16:19.470 --> 16:22.439
an obsequious
American history major

16:22.480 --> 16:23.708
who's been fawning
over his collection.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.342
I enjoy water sports and
people who don't suck.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.678
You are a honey trap.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.347
I'm a patriot.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.586
And over our
last exchanges,

16:30.620 --> 16:32.247
I've deftly steered
the conversation

16:32.290 --> 16:34.281
towards him letting me
see a copy of his atlas.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.389
He showsme his
Virginia...

16:35.420 --> 16:36.614
I-I get it.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.218
I had hoped to
hear back from him

16:38.260 --> 16:39.682
by the time you arrived,
but depending on

16:39.730 --> 16:41.322
whether he's married,
and whether or not

16:41.360 --> 16:42.395
Mrs. Cornblatt
shares his computer,

16:42.430 --> 16:43.624
might take some time.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.796
Where's Kitty?

16:44.830 --> 16:45.797
Office supply run.

16:45.830 --> 16:46.797
I require staples.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.036
(clicks)

16:56.440 --> 16:59.000
Been running her a little
ragged lately, haven't you?

17:00.680 --> 17:02.318
Kitty.

17:02.350 --> 17:04.614
My instruction is not
for the weakhearted, Watson.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.379
You know this.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.308
Well, she's trying to be
a little more social lately,

17:08.360 --> 17:10.055
so you might want
to ease up on her.

17:10.090 --> 17:11.523
Get your own protg,
Watson.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.824
I'm just saying, I think
it's a good step for her.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.328
So, if it means giving her
a little more free time,

17:16.360 --> 17:18.396
then I'm willing to
pick up the slack.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.432
And I'm not gonna run out and
get you staples or anything,

17:20.470 --> 17:22.392
but if you are working on a
case, and you need a second

17:22.440 --> 17:24.499
set of eyes and someone to
talk to, then you can call me.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.802
I couldn't before?

17:25.840 --> 17:28.104
Of course you could...

17:29.580 --> 17:31.639
You asked me to be
a part of her life,

17:31.680 --> 17:33.545
to help her learn...

17:33.580 --> 17:35.548
(cell phone buzzes)

17:35.580 --> 17:36.410
It's Cornblatt.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.180
He regrets to report

17:39.220 --> 17:42.189
that he no longer has the
unfinished Smythe's Virginia.

17:42.220 --> 17:45.189
Gave up that hobby and
sold it to an anonymous buyer

17:45.230 --> 17:46.686
several months ago.

17:46.730 --> 17:49.290
Got a ridiculously high price
for it, he wants Amber to know.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.366
Well, if we don't know
the name of the buyer,

17:51.400 --> 17:53.368
then how is Amber gonna
send him dirty pictures?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.732
You underestimate
her resolve.

18:04.810 --> 18:07.370
Austin Cornblatt.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.445
Detective Marcus
Bell, NYPD.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.586
You had an o_n|ine
conversation earlier today

18:12.620 --> 18:15.350
with someone
named Amber1776?

18:15.390 --> 18:17.756
Oh, God.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.452
Please don't tell me
she's under 18.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.492
Amber is definitely not what
she represented herself to be.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.868
My life is over.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.595
All right, Mr.
Cornblatt, slow down.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.608
You're not in
any trouble.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.505
You didn't do
anything illegal.

18:32.540 --> 18:35.338
You mentioned that you sold an
atlas called Smythe's Virginia

18:35.380 --> 18:37.348
to an anonymous buyer.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.348
You're kidding me.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.541
She was actually
interested in that?

18:41.580 --> 18:44.413
The department is trying
to locate the buyer.

18:44.450 --> 18:45.712
So, we'd like your
permission to look

18:45.750 --> 18:47.513
at your bank
transfer records,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.209
shipping info,
anything you might have

18:49.260 --> 18:52.627
that would help us identify
who bought the atlas.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.629
And if I help you?

18:55.660 --> 18:58.390
No one ever
finds out about Amber?

18:58.430 --> 19:00.432
All that stays
between us.

19:02.670 --> 19:05.309
I can do better
than bank records.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.308
I was contacted
by a law firm.

19:07.340 --> 19:08.637
I'll give you
the name.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.648
They acted as intermediary
for the sale.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.279
Well, she apologizes
again and swears again

19:25.330 --> 19:26.581
that she passed
our message

19:26.630 --> 19:28.188
about the atlas
on to her bosses.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.222
Someone will be out
to speak to us shortly.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.794
There's a helicopter
landing on the roof.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.808
Can't hear that, can you?

19:38.840 --> 19:41.809
Actually, I can.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.207
It's a Sikorslq S-92,
a 2010 model.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.639
Mm, the rotor is pulling
a little bit to the left.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.477
You mock what
you do not understand.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.715
You have great hearing,
I understand.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.354
So this lot
from the coffee shop--

19:56.390 --> 19:57.982
she's mentioned
them to you-- Kitty.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.554
Mm-hmm.

19:59.590 --> 20:00.750
She told you about them, too?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.199
In so many words.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.691
Is there something wrong
with them?

20:05.730 --> 20:07.595
There's a young man
among their number.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.829
Okay, so she likes the guy.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.735
I might've caught a glimpse
of a text message,

20:12.770 --> 20:14.931
quite unintentionally,
you understand?
Oh, my God.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.675
You've been keeping
her busy on purpose!

20:16.710 --> 20:17.699
WOMAN:
Miss Watson?

20:17.750 --> 20:18.876
Mr. Holmes.

20:18.910 --> 20:19.945
Sharon Tavener.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.572
I'm one of the partners.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.508
Sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.711
You had us at a disadvantage.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.887
Now we're all caught up.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.718
Please, follow me.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.728
Sherlock Holmes, Joan Watson?

20:37.770 --> 20:40.591
William Hull.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.369
The name is familiar,

20:42.400 --> 20:43.958
I take it?
HOLMES: Indeed.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.399
William Hull, real
estate magnate.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.499
A man whose eponymous
monstrosities

20:48.540 --> 20:50.679
have been scouring the
Manhattan skyline for decades.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.849
I was given a brief on you.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.575
You don't disappoint.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.871
Please.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.809
So, that was your helicopter
landing on the roof?

20:59.850 --> 21:01.715
We weren't just waiting

21:01.760 --> 21:03.011
for your lawyers
to figure out who we were.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.721
You wanted to be here in person.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.455
HULL:
You two have
qUIte a reputation.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.594
I thought you deserved

21:08.630 --> 21:10.052
a face-to-face.
HOLMES: Obviously

21:10.100 --> 21:12.523
you were the anonymous buyer

21:12.570 --> 21:14.663
of Austin Cornblatt's atlas.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.634
I brought it with me because
you told the receptionist

21:16.670 --> 21:19.059
you were interested in it.
You want it?

21:19.110 --> 21:21.374
Take it. It's yours.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.844
Actually we're more interested
in the map it once contained.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.701
The one that the Bray family
gave to that library, right?

21:26.750 --> 21:28.809
You're aware of it?
I watch the news.

21:28.850 --> 21:31.739
I know that the one
that turned up is a fake.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.088
I'm interested in the original,
same as you.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.485
Hearing that the Brays

21:36.660 --> 21:37.820
I've come to finding one.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.828
Which is the other reason
I'm here.

21:39.860 --> 21:42.420
I'd like to hire you
to find it for me.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.389
Mr. Hull, are you
familiar with a man

21:47.440 --> 21:49.328
by the name of Stuart Zupko?

21:49.370 --> 21:51.008
The thief. The dead one.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.679
You're wondering
ifI made him the same offer?

21:53.710 --> 21:57.373
I didn't. Never even heard
of him before yesterday.

21:57.410 --> 21:59.378
You have my word.

21:59.410 --> 22:01.469
Oh, well, now that
we have your word.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.738
(laughs)
I have information that I think

22:03.790 --> 22:05.849
might help you with your case.

22:05.890 --> 22:08.654
Information
about a certain third party.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.022
A third party with their
own designs on the map.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.755
And the reason
you have until now

22:12.790 --> 22:15.725
ignored your civic duty and kept
this information to yourself?

22:15.760 --> 22:18.024
Is that I can't be sure
that they're behind all this.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.834
I could be exposing myself
to a lawsuit.

22:23.770 --> 22:24.930
Come on, think about it.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.767
IfI had anything
to do with the crimes,

22:26.810 --> 22:28.698
would I be so stupid
as to identify myself to you?

22:28.740 --> 22:29.877
I could have just
told my attorneys

22:29.910 --> 22:30.945
to send you on your way.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.948
So, come on, work for me.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.743
If I'm right about

22:34.780 --> 22:36.611
the other party,
you won't just be making

22:36.650 --> 22:38.083
an obscene amount of money.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.509
You'll be bringing
a criminal to justice.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.358
Isn't that what really matters?

22:50.470 --> 22:51.789
That was abrupt.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.661
But satisfying, no?

22:53.700 --> 22:55.065
Well, should we call
Captain Gregson?

22:55.100 --> 22:56.795
So that Hull
and his cronies can deny

22:56.840 --> 22:58.637
this meeting ever took place?
What's the point?

22:58.670 --> 22:59.762
Well, he said it himself.

22:59.810 --> 23:00.731
He might know who hired Zupko.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.509
Bollocks. If he did, he would've

23:02.540 --> 23:04.007
passed that information
to the police the same way

23:04.050 --> 23:05.847
he bought that atlas.
Anonymously.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.916
No. The real purpose
of this meeting

23:07.950 --> 23:09.178
was to buy our allegiance.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.518
He knows that we seek
the Bray map.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.086
And in the event we find it,
he wants to ensure we pass it

23:13.120 --> 23:15.156
to no one but him.
If the whole point

23:15.190 --> 23:16.817
of acquiring the map is
to complete the atlas,

23:16.860 --> 23:19.021
then why did he just offer
to give us his copy?

23:19.060 --> 23:21.756
Because completing the atlas
is not the point.
(door closes)

23:23.200 --> 23:25.088
He obviously
couldn't care less

23:25.130 --> 23:26.722
about its value
as a collectable.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.465
And if it's irrelevant to him,

23:28.500 --> 23:29.728
I predict it's
equally irrelevant

23:29.770 --> 23:31.032
to the third party he mentioned.

23:31.070 --> 23:32.901
Then why would any
of them want it?

23:32.940 --> 23:34.100
The Bray map is old.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.937
And for being old,
it is valuable.

23:35.980 --> 23:37.447
But that is not the point of it.

23:37.480 --> 23:40.813
Think-- what is a map
but a record?

23:40.850 --> 23:44.741
It-It's a piece of parchment
splashed with information.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.940
So, it's not the physical
map they're after.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.981
It's the information.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.068
I see rivers...

24:02.100 --> 24:04.637
and hills, some towns.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.467
I suppose it qualifies
as information,

24:06.510 --> 24:08.899
but is it important in 2014?

24:08.940 --> 24:10.805
That is the question,
is it not?

24:10.850 --> 24:13.717
Unfortunately, this isn't
even the map that's important.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.218
It's a scan of the one
the library had.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.740
Which we know is a forgery.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.746
We thought that
Stuart Zupko was killed

24:19.790 --> 24:23.157
because he had procured a map
of no collectable value.

24:23.190 --> 24:25.886
I now believe that he died
because the map had no

24:25.930 --> 24:28.524
informational value.
KITTY:
But it's a copy.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.720
Shouldn't all the
information be the same?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.966
It should.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.888
"Should" being
the key word.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.535
Now, I believe that
the original Bray map,

24:35.570 --> 24:36.992
wherever it now resides,

24:37.040 --> 24:39.065
includes data which the forgery

24:39.110 --> 24:41.670
does not,
data worth killing for.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.940
Which means we need to find out

24:43.980 --> 24:45.675
what the forgery is missing.
Well, how?

24:45.710 --> 24:47.268
Like you said, the original's
nowhere to be found.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.119
There's no way
of comparing the two.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.845
Only partially true.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.084
Miss Bray was kind enough
to give us these photographs.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.621
They all include
images of the map.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.696
And they were
all taken before 1940.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.163
The expert who
analyzed the forgery

25:05.200 --> 25:07.168
said it was made using
ink from the 19405.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.736
So, if we look at photographs
from the '205 and '305...

25:08.770 --> 25:11.204
We can assume we're looking
at the original.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.107
None of them feature the map...

25:14.140 --> 25:15.630
(muttering)

25:15.680 --> 25:17.944
But with proper scrutiny,

25:17.980 --> 25:21.177
the discrepancies might
present themselves.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.176
(cell phone ringing)

25:23.220 --> 25:24.949
Uh...
Do you need to take that?

25:24.990 --> 25:27.049
No, I don't believe she does.
How would you know?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.785
Because we got a lot
of work to do and very
little time to do it.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.879
I'm here. I can help.
And help you shall.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.181
(sighs)
What if my phone rings?

25:32.230 --> 25:33.891
Do I need your permission
to answer it?

25:33.930 --> 25:35.898
You are not my protge.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.069
Uh...

25:39.230 --> 25:40.868
I'd like to go to the loo.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.993
Unless either of you have
any objections.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.730
You can't do that.

25:48.780 --> 25:49.804
I can't do what?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.569
You can't police her like that.
You can't tell her

25:51.610 --> 25:52.770
who she can and can't talk to.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.141
I'm training her.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.738
To be what-- a shut-in?
I know how you feel

25:55.780 --> 25:56.747
about romantic entanglements.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.281
You think love is stupid.
Fine.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.311
Whatever. But if that is
the guy that she likes...

26:00.350 --> 26:01.658
Then he'll call again!

26:01.690 --> 26:03.783
And again and again!

26:03.830 --> 26:06.685
This is exactly the same kind of
crap you used to pull with me.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.698
I needed my space
and so does she!

26:08.730 --> 26:10.152
Because you are the same.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.168
Your situations are identical.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.964
Yes! You were a virtual hermit
when I found you in London.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.968
You could barely look me in
the eye because I was a man,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.707
and a man had hurt you
so horrifically, yes!

26:19.740 --> 26:21.037
You told me on more
than one occa5ion

26:21.080 --> 26:22.138
that you thought of
doing yourself harm.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.841
Yes, yes, I see it now.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.848
You and her are virtually
indistinguishable.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.916
Thank for helping me
see that. Thank you.

26:27.950 --> 26:31.044
Y-You're assuming that I'm
interfering for selfish reasons.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.081
But I'm just merely trying to...

26:33.120 --> 26:34.815
To protect her.

26:36.790 --> 26:37.984
She's come a long way, Watson.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.850
She's come a very long way.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.757
And most of that progress is
testament to her great strength.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.791
Yes. But I dare say
that I had a hand.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.263
So, if some dalliance
was to go wrong,

26:46.300 --> 26:48.097
and if it was to hurt
her in some way...

26:48.140 --> 26:49.334
It would hurt you, too.

26:49.370 --> 26:50.735
I understand why you're afraid,

26:50.770 --> 26:52.101
but this is progress, too.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.164
You get that, right?

26:53.210 --> 26:54.871
(footsteps approaching)

26:58.110 --> 27:00.977
So, I'll make copies of the
Bray map and the photographs.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.289
if we work independently.

27:13.190 --> 27:16.023
HOLMES:
So, last night
we asked ourselves,

27:16.060 --> 27:19.166
"How does the real Bray map
differ from the forgery?"

27:19.200 --> 27:20.792
Obviously the answer is

27:20.840 --> 27:23.161
to shine a bright light
in my face.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.431
I've spent several hours
comparing images of the forgery

27:26.470 --> 27:28.677
to those photographs
supplied by Margaret Bray.

27:28.710 --> 27:29.836
And as far as I can tell,

27:29.880 --> 27:31.871
original and forgery
are identical.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.978
The information on the original

27:35.020 --> 27:36.669
isn't what makes it so valuable.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.187
My theory was right.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.142
The question was wrong.
We should've asked ourselves,

27:40.190 --> 27:43.159
"How does the Bray map
differ from reality?"

27:45.490 --> 27:48.152
This is a modern-day depiction
of the land in the Bray map.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.760
That is the Bray map.

27:53.430 --> 27:55.466
It all lines up
pretty perfectly.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.809
Edward Smythe was
a fine mapmaker.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.899
Collectors are right
to covet his work.

27:59.940 --> 28:02.477
But you're wrong--
it doesn't line up perfectly.

28:02.510 --> 28:06.378
Note this one small section
of the Spotswood River,

28:06.410 --> 28:08.116
where at some point
over the last

28:08.150 --> 28:10.812
220 years, the river
has shifted its course.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.442
And why is that important?

28:12.490 --> 28:13.957
Because an Indian casino is

28:13.990 --> 28:15.082
currently slated
for construction

28:15.120 --> 28:17.088
right there.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.428
Now...

28:18.460 --> 28:19.825
it will be the first
in the state

28:19.860 --> 28:21.396
if, indeed, it is completed.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.864
The regulatory hurdles
that such a proposal

28:23.900 --> 28:25.265
needs to clear are
Byzantine to say the least.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.961
And what we are looking at

28:27.000 --> 28:30.060
here... may be
the project's death blow.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.237
The treaty

28:31.270 --> 28:33.773
which established
this reservation

28:33.810 --> 28:36.074
defines the easternmost border
as the Spotswood River

28:36.110 --> 28:38.806
and cites this very map
as its source.

28:40.350 --> 28:43.478
So, back then, the river
veered more to the west.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.114
Which means the proposed
site of the casino

28:46.150 --> 28:48.118
is not on the reservation
at all.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.286
They can't build there.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.924
Due to topographical concerns,

28:50.960 --> 28:54.293
no other site on the
reservation will do.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.457
And so, the reason to hunt

28:56.500 --> 28:58.866
for the real Bray map
becomes clear.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.994
It, unlike a forgery,
would be admissible in court.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.008
And would in all likelihood,
spell the end

29:04.040 --> 29:06.008
of a billion-dollar endeavor.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.270
Okay, so what does all of this

29:08.310 --> 29:10.278
have to do with William Hull?

29:10.310 --> 29:11.868
Well, aside from his real estate
in New York,

29:11.910 --> 29:13.912
he owns seve_ral _casinos
in Atlantic City.

29:13.950 --> 29:16.919
A casino in Virginia would
take business away from him.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.918
So, you think Hull's the killer?

29:18.950 --> 29:21.817
I'm almost certain
that he is not.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.055
He has no motive to
steal the Bray map.

29:24.090 --> 29:25.523
If he'd known it was
in the 39th Street Library,

29:28.960 --> 29:31.520
Then who?

29:31.570 --> 29:33.765
(indistinct chatter)

29:35.240 --> 29:37.060
You the folks
who were asking to see me?

29:37.100 --> 29:38.965
Leon Moody, General Manager.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.807
Sherlock Holmes.
My colleagues and I

29:40.840 --> 29:43.035
are consultants with the NYPD.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.547
A little far upstate,
aren't you?

29:44.580 --> 29:46.207
KITTY:
Once two murders
have been committed,

29:46.250 --> 29:48.218
we go where the case takes us.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.979
WATSON: You're not just
the general manager here.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.317
You're also chairman
of the Algonquian

29:51.350 --> 29:52.908
Gaming Commission, right?

29:52.950 --> 29:54.850
The same commission
which is funding

29:54.890 --> 29:56.949
the Powhatan tribe's efforts
to build a casino in Virginia.

29:56.990 --> 29:58.548
Two men were
murdered this week

29:58.590 --> 30:00.922
because someone tried to steal
a map from a library

30:00.960 --> 30:02.825
that could derail that project.

30:02.860 --> 30:04.919
Now, if you help us identify the
perpetrators, you have our word

30:04.970 --> 30:07.325
_ no one will know
the information came from you.

30:07.370 --> 30:10.089
You folks got a long drive
back to the city.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.937
You ought to get going.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.062
What if I ask a question first?

30:13.110 --> 30:15.977
I came here_ before
my assoaates

30:16.010 --> 30:17.944
and whilst I was walking past
your blackjack tables,

30:17.980 --> 30:20.574
I couldn't help
taking these videos.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.113
You gotta delete those.
It's all in the cloud now.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.947
I noticed

30:24.990 --> 30:25.911
how rarely face cards
were coming up.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.486
They make up almost
a quarter of the deck,

30:27.520 --> 30:28.987
but in my videos,

30:29.020 --> 30:30.612
I don't see them
nearly that often.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.628
Got me thinking.
What if the casino,

30:32.660 --> 30:34.196
say, pulled a few kings
and queens

30:34.230 --> 30:36.198
from each of those
SIX decks you use?

30:36.230 --> 30:37.458
The house wouldn't
have to pay out

30:37.500 --> 30:39.468
for blackjack nearly as often.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.491
HOLMES:
It's only a small sample,
but we have colleagues

30:41.540 --> 30:43.496
at the FBI who would be more
than willing to take a look,

30:43.540 --> 30:46.100
and if they were to shut you
down for just one day...

30:46.140 --> 30:48.028
how much might
you lose?

30:48.080 --> 30:50.275
We're just asking for a name.

30:52.110 --> 30:54.112
Come with me.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.617
Is that...
The original?

31:03.660 --> 31:05.252
What do you think?

31:06.590 --> 31:08.399
As you're probably aware,

31:08.430 --> 31:10.921
this is the second such forgery
we've seen in as many days.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.962
It's not quite as good
as the other one, but still...

31:14.000 --> 31:15.638
Why are you showing
this to us?

31:17.070 --> 31:18.958
My, um...

31:19.010 --> 31:21.331
associates and I only realized
the King James County map

31:21.380 --> 31:23.575
was at that library
a few weeks ago.

31:23.610 --> 31:25.339
We thought it was real.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.109
We knew it_ could be
used against us,

31:27.150 --> 31:29.277
so we arranged to
have this one made.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.469
We were going to pay someone
at the library

31:30.520 --> 31:32.317
to switch ours out with theirs.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.318
No one was going to get hurt.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.112
KITTY:
So if anyone
subpoenaed the map--

31:36.160 --> 31:37.479
William Hull's attorneys,

31:37.520 --> 31:39.124
for example-- your interests

31:39.160 --> 31:40.525
would be
protected.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.448
Someone would discover
the map was a fake

31:42.500 --> 31:45.389
and then plans for the casino
would keep moving forward.

31:45.430 --> 31:47.523
You can imagine our surprise
when we saw the news this week.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.231
Someone else had
stolen the map,

31:49.270 --> 31:50.498
a guard had
been killed.

31:50.540 --> 31:51.962
Then the map turns up,
only the police say

31:52.010 --> 31:53.432
it was a fake
all along.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.973
We realized we'd gotten
ourselves all worked up

31:56.010 --> 31:57.978
over absolutely
nothing.

31:58.010 --> 32:00.501
Uh... you're more than welcome
to take it.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.177
We never did anything
illegal with it.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.085
Now, I know
you were hoping

32:04.120 --> 32:06.213
for a name, but can
I at least assume

32:06.250 --> 32:08.514
that you'll delete
all of those videos?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.255
Our colleagues at the FBI

32:10.290 --> 32:13.123
will hear nothing of your
questionable gaming practices.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.696
(exhales)

32:14.730 --> 32:16.721
Obviously, I hope the real map
never turns up.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.729
We have a lot riding
on the casino in Virginia.

32:19.770 --> 32:22.238
But two murders?

32:22.270 --> 32:23.567
I only wish I could be
of more help.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.306
Actually,
you've been

32:25.340 --> 32:27.228
more helpful
than you realize.

32:27.270 --> 32:30.637
I think I know
who killed Stuart Zupko.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.612
Kitty, right?

32:40.650 --> 32:42.982
You _remember
Captain Gregson.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.159
Mr. Holmes said on the phone
that you've uncovered

32:45.190 --> 32:47.283
another forgery
of my family's map.

32:47.330 --> 32:48.558
We'll show you.
Hmm.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.233
Miss Bray.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.172
It certainly looks authentic.

33:04.210 --> 33:06.542
It is, in fact,
a rather crude reproduction.

33:06.580 --> 33:09.048
Forger never had access
to the original.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.446
He did his best using
the high-resolution scans

33:11.490 --> 33:14.254
the 39th Street Library
made available
on their Web site.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.587
And where did
this one come from?

33:15.620 --> 33:17.087
HOLMES:
It was commissioned

33:17.120 --> 33:19.623
by a group which is trying
to build a casino.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.628
They were worried
that the original would

33:21.660 --> 33:24.527
kill their project,
so they planned to discredit it

33:24.570 --> 33:26.128
by replacing it with this one.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.762
WATSON:
Would you like to know
where the casino

33:27.800 --> 33:28.698
is going to go?

33:30.240 --> 33:32.561
Right here.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.033
Your family still owns land
just outside the reservation,

33:35.080 --> 33:36.433
land that would be worth

33:36.480 --> 33:38.368
hundreds of millions
of dollars,

33:38.410 --> 33:41.140
but only if the casino
went forward.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.716
There would be hotels,
restaurants...

33:42.750 --> 33:44.741
Pawnshops, the odd
money lender...

33:44.790 --> 33:46.610
Now, you knew about
your grandfather's map

33:46.650 --> 33:49.118
and the trouble it would _cause
once people noticed it.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.788
People like, say, William Hull.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.694
KITTY:
This all started
when the library

33:54.730 --> 33:56.618
put a scan of the map online.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.265
You couldn't just steal it
and make it disappear.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.791
You had to throw the history
of the original into question.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.058
HOLMES:
So you commissioned

34:04.110 --> 34:06.032
this forgery.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.668
This is the map we found

34:10.710 --> 34:13.076
at the scene of
Stuart Zupko's murder.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.146
I'm sorry,
are you suggesting that...

34:18.190 --> 34:21.284
that I had something to do
with what happened to him?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.152
You said that the...

34:27.190 --> 34:28.828
the map that was stolen,

34:28.860 --> 34:31.522
it was forged in the 19405.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.869
How could I have possibly
commissioned it?

34:34.900 --> 34:36.265
I wasn't even born yet.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.836
In point of fact,

34:37.870 --> 34:39.428
we said the ink
was produced in the 19405.

34:39.470 --> 34:41.506
The map that Zupko stole,

34:41.540 --> 34:43.508
_ the one that was
in the library for years,

34:43.540 --> 34:46.873
was the genuine article
after all.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.775
HOLMES:
You commissioned him
to acquire it for you.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.412
You then brought
it to a forger,

34:50.450 --> 34:52.384
with instructions
to create a copy

34:52.420 --> 34:55.116
which looked like it had
been made 70 years ago.

34:55.160 --> 34:58.129
You then murdered Stuart Zupko.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.752
You left the forgery
at the scene

34:59.790 --> 35:01.849
to make it look like
a handoff had gone awry.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.719
There's very few guys
in New York

35:02.760 --> 35:04.466
that could pull
something like this off.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.298
You needed someone
from the old school.

35:07.330 --> 35:08.831
Someone like...

35:08.870 --> 35:10.633
Franco DeMasi.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.529
We showed him photos
of what you did to Zupko

35:15.580 --> 35:17.468
and hinted that
he might be next.

35:17.510 --> 35:19.341
He's cutting
a deal right now.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.814
A career criminal

35:21.850 --> 35:23.841
tells you that I hired him,

35:23.880 --> 35:25.882
which is what he knows
that you want to hear,

35:25.920 --> 35:28.616
and you start throwing
accusations around?

35:28.660 --> 35:30.719
After Mr. DeMasi
completed his work,

35:30.760 --> 35:32.387
he returned the original to you,

35:32.430 --> 35:33.852
which you, of course, destroyed.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.892
But when making
a forgery

35:35.930 --> 35:38.626
using copper plate,
it takes negligibly more time

35:38.670 --> 35:41.389
to create two copies,
rather than one.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.396
He realized_ how valuable
the original was

35:43.440 --> 35:46.329
and so he made a second
duplicate to hand off to you.

35:46.370 --> 35:48.304
He kept the real
one for himself.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.932
This real one.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.346
Now, this map

35:52.380 --> 35:54.940
has traces of mold on it,

35:54.980 --> 35:57.244
which prove it
was in a drawer

35:57.280 --> 36:00.249
in the 39th Street
Library for decades.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.951
It also has your
fingerprints all over it.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.220
I'm guessing
you fly a lot.

36:04.260 --> 36:07.650
'Cause the trusted trav_eler
program you gave your prints to?

36:07.690 --> 36:09.351
It interfaces with our system.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.921
All in all,
DeMasi's word against yours

36:13.970 --> 36:15.767
is sounding pretty good.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.278
(door opens)

36:25.310 --> 36:26.538
(door closes)

36:31.690 --> 36:33.510
Gonna sit there, or
are you gonna help me?

36:33.550 --> 36:35.359
Have a seat.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.688
Watson has impressed upon me

36:48.740 --> 36:50.537
that I owe you an apology.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.504
You may have noticed

36:52.540 --> 36:55.475
I've been keeping you
rather busy lately.

36:55.510 --> 36:58.377
Some of the errands were...
beneath you.

36:58.410 --> 37:00.901
You were very clear about
all of this in London.

37:00.950 --> 37:03.475
You told me that there'd be_
scut work, every now and again.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.909
I'm aware of the young man
at the coffee shop.

37:05.950 --> 37:07.383
Zachary.

37:07.420 --> 37:10.355
I know you've
developed a rapport

37:10.390 --> 37:12.585
and he is,
in his own plodding way,

37:12.630 --> 37:14.393
courting you.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.591
I was worried.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.029
So...

37:20.070 --> 37:22.766
I kept you
otherwise engaged.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.234
That was a mistake.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.929
I have watched the progress
you've made

37:29.980 --> 37:32.699
over the last few _months
With great pride.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.978
And you've come a very long way.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.409
I should have trusted you to...

37:38.450 --> 37:40.748
continue that progression.

37:42.490 --> 37:44.287
I knew.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.888
You knew what?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.057
I could tell that you'd...

37:48.090 --> 37:51.389
figured out about Zachary.

37:51.430 --> 37:54.433
I knew that's why
you were keeping me busy.

37:56.070 --> 37:59.301
But I was glad of it.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.501
I was afraid, as well.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.568
Zachary's sweet, he's...

38:06.610 --> 38:09.044
And he likes me.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.481
What you did made me feel...

38:14.520 --> 38:17.489
very
protected. . .

38:17.520 --> 38:18.726
(sniffs)

38:18.760 --> 38:21.456
...and very loved.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.022
So just stop moping about.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.493
I've got ice cream to put away.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.929
(footsteps receding)

38:49.060 --> 38:51.528
Watson's offered to reclaim

38:51.560 --> 38:52.982
a greater role
in our collaboration,

38:53.030 --> 38:57.091
so that I might give you
some more personal time.

38:57.130 --> 38:59.769
I shall be accepting her offer.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.689
How you choose to
spend that time...

39:02.740 --> 39:05.732
that's entirely up to you.

39:12.810 --> 39:15.415
*

39:19.150 --> 39:20.378
This
Zachary...

39:20.420 --> 39:22.479
does he have
an aver5ion to insects?

39:22.520 --> 39:24.112
You said you were
going to leave him be.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.821
There's an entomology exhibit

39:25.860 --> 39:27.782
at the Museum
of Natural History.

39:27.830 --> 39:30.993
I thought you and I should pay
a visit there this afternoon.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.624
If your friend is free,

39:33.670 --> 39:35.865
perhaps he'd like to join us.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.408
I'll call him.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.442
And find out.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.416
