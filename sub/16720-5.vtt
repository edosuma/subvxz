Psst. Here comes your father.

00:33.499 --> 00:35.591
Nice try.
I saw you looking.

Yeah, we're married, not buried!

Look, I know you kids are
excited about the food trucks

00:41.237 --> 00:43.195
that are stealing our business
and bankrupting us.

00:43.225 --> 00:44.416
I'm excited.

00:44.446 --> 00:46.301
What's so great about
getting food from a truck?

00:46.331 --> 00:48.088
There's no sitting area.
There's no bathroom.

Animals eat like that.

I don't know, Bob,
I think it's nice.

00:53.339 --> 00:54.796
It's like camping.

00:54.826 --> 00:56.852
Except without
all that awful nature.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.406
It's just a trend, Lin,

00:58.436 --> 01:00.294
and anyway, say good-bye
to the trucks, kids.

01:00.324 --> 01:03.170
Because tomorrow we are
taking back the street.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.423

No. Filmmaking was just
a hobbytunity for me.

How can you afford this?

02:15.074 --> 02:16.879
Hmm... I have my ways, Bob.

02:16.909 --> 02:19.654
One of those ways is that I have

idea, I should get a food truck!

can follow us.

the truck around?

Yes! I think.

gonna park out in front

be stealing someone else's.

making enough money

08:00.640 --> 08:01.971
Yes, on your birthday.

08:02.001 --> 08:05.080
@BobsBurgersFoodTruck
is just fine.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.735
Yeah, if this was
three years ago.

08:06.765 --> 08:07.971
Oh, you were serious.

Yo-ho! Guys!

08:36.616 --> 08:39.244
Guess who closed the
restaurant and came on the road?

08:39.274 --> 08:41.977
We're gonna be like the
Partridge family, but with food.

08:42.006 --> 08:43.655
You closed the restaurant?

08:43.686 --> 08:45.604
Lin, we need to have both
going at the same time.

08:45.634 --> 08:47.767
Fine, then you go work there.
I don't want to.

08:47.797 --> 08:49.606
Good! So make room for
Mommy in the fun-bus!

08:49.636 --> 08:51.111
Dad, drive.

08:51.141 --> 08:53.902
Hey, hey!
BOB: Lin, come on.

08:53.932 --> 08:55.925
- GENE AND LOUISE: Okay, go.
- I'm not in! Don't go!

08:55.955 --> 08:57.368
GENE: Yes! Go, go, go.
LOUISE: Drive!

08:57.398 --> 08:58.539
Where you going?
Hey, my foot!

08:58.569 --> 09:00.119
I told you this would be fun.

09:00.149 --> 09:01.483
Hey!

09:03.225 --> 09:04.365
BOB:
<i>All right.</i>

09:04.395 --> 09:05.903
Everybody out.
Bedtime.

09:05.933 --> 09:07.892
In the house?
I hate the house.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.479
Now that we're not
doing the restaurant,

09:09.509 --> 09:11.335
the house feels
kind of pointless.

09:11.365 --> 09:13.758
What do you want to do,
sleep in the truck?

09:13.788 --> 09:15.448
- I'll go get the sleeping bags.
- Yeah!

09:15.478 --> 09:16.934
And my moisturising gloves!

09:16.964 --> 09:19.474
And Tina's body pillow!
He has a name!

09:19.504 --> 09:21.372
Sorry, Jeffrey.

09:25.144 --> 09:26.654
A new name calls for a new look.

09:28.396 --> 09:29.604
And a new voice.

09:29.634 --> 09:31.508
Tina talks like this.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.289
(SAME VOICE):
Dina talks like this.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.386
Nice-sized line, Bob.

09:35.416 --> 09:36.933
You're almost getting
the hang of this.

09:36.963 --> 09:38.094
Yeah, you know, it's fun.

09:38.124 --> 09:39.599
Too bad we're not
making any profit.

09:39.629 --> 09:42.473
Between the repairs, the gas...
Hey, Dad...

09:42.503 --> 09:44.880
and that,
we are still in the red.

09:44.910 --> 09:47.454
Oh, well, if you want to
actually make money on this,

09:47.484 --> 09:49.426
you've got to get on
the festival circuit.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.048
First one of the season
is this weekend.

09:51.078 --> 09:52.903
Lolla-pa-foods-a?

09:52.933 --> 09:55.026
Isn't it funny how much
more I know than you?

09:55.056 --> 09:56.897
No.
I think it's embarrassing.

09:56.927 --> 10:00.541
Anyway... Everyone gets drunk
and spends lots of money.

10:00.571 --> 10:02.914
And this year Tabitha Johansson
is headlining the concert.

10:02.944 --> 10:05.555
- Tabitha who?
- (SCOFFS): The sexy pianist.

10:05.585 --> 10:07.628
She sings that song
about oil spills,

10:07.658 --> 10:09.768
but you know she's talking
about her vagina.

10:09.798 --> 10:11.204
Gene.
How do you know that?

10:11.234 --> 10:13.177
It's not subtle.
It really isn't.

10:13.207 --> 10:15.885
Plus, the most popular truck
gets a cash prize:

10:15.915 --> 10:17.055
A thousand bucks.

10:17.085 --> 10:18.759
Wow, that sounds great.

10:18.789 --> 10:20.431
We could really use
a thousand bucks.

10:20.461 --> 10:22.570
The festival circuit.
Maybe we'll never come home!

10:22.600 --> 10:23.891
Why would you?

10:23.921 --> 10:25.396
Yeah. We can get truck-schooled!

10:25.426 --> 10:27.050
And have truck prom.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.877
Hey, you'd be friends
with everyone in school!

10:28.907 --> 10:30.541
You would.
Oh, yeah.

10:34.317 --> 10:37.446
All right. Everyone's got
their seat belt on.

10:37.476 --> 10:38.793
(SNORES)

10:41.337 --> 10:43.278
LINDA:
<i>Ooh...</i>

10:43.308 --> 10:45.669
Ooh! This thing is
big and intimidating.

10:45.699 --> 10:47.257
I don't know if
I should drive it...

10:47.287 --> 10:48.594
Hey, Jennifer Slow-pez!

10:48.624 --> 10:50.426
Get the hell out of the road!

10:50.456 --> 10:52.271
My God, Lin.
What?

10:52.301 --> 10:54.294
What's gotten into you?
I don't know.

10:54.324 --> 10:56.148
This truck just makes me
feel so powerful.

10:56.178 --> 10:57.529
I think I'm okay now.

10:57.559 --> 10:59.308
Hey, Driving Miss Crazy,

10:59.338 --> 11:00.572
pick a lane!

11:19.094 --> 11:20.335
Hurry up! Hurry up!

11:20.365 --> 11:21.738
Lin, are you okay?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.243
You seem a little on edge.

11:23.273 --> 11:24.547
I'm hopped up on bennies, Bob.

11:24.577 --> 11:25.783
Don't tell the kids.

11:25.813 --> 11:27.070
What?
Where'd you get those?

11:27.100 --> 11:28.524
They hooked me up
at the truck stop.

11:28.554 --> 11:31.165
- See?
- These are non-drowsy antihistamines.

11:31.195 --> 11:33.355
Well, whatever they are,
they're doing the trick.

11:33.385 --> 11:35.661
(GROANS) It's gonna take
forever to get inside.

11:35.691 --> 11:37.934
No, it won't. No one's
using this right-hand lane,

11:37.964 --> 11:39.132
I'll tell you that.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.209
Uh, Lin, I think
this is the sidewalk.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.340
(HORN BLARES, MAN GASPS)

11:48.370 --> 11:50.436
Use the crosswalk, you maniac!

11:50.466 --> 11:52.217
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

11:58.667 --> 12:00.462
Okay, you guys are
my street team.

12:00.499 --> 12:03.096
We need to make some money,
and it wouldn't hurt

12:03.136 --> 12:04.813
to win "most popular truck."

12:04.850 --> 12:06.529
Gene, Louise you're gonna
pass out samples.

12:06.565 --> 12:08.642
I wouldn't mind
passing out samples.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.994
Dina's ready to mingle.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.258
Fine by me! Let the
new girl do it.

12:12.297 --> 12:13.918
Fine, just be aggressive.

12:13.954 --> 12:15.816
Dina only plays offence.

12:15.853 --> 12:18.500
Gene, Louise, you write
our Chowster updates.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.198
Make us sound cool.

12:20.234 --> 12:21.964
Okay. Should I just
write negative stuff

12:22.001 --> 12:24.437
about the other trucks so that
people will come to ours?

12:24.476 --> 12:26.398
No, You should not do that.

12:26.435 --> 12:29.139
Okay, I definitely won't.

12:29.179 --> 12:31.135
Free samples.
Bob's Burgers.

12:31.173 --> 12:32.252
Hey, cool glasses.

12:32.286 --> 12:33.846
Thanks. I need them to see.

12:33.882 --> 12:36.238
Ha! Is this organic?
Sure.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.123
Is it grass-fed?
Yes.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.536
Cruelty-free?

12:39.571 --> 12:41.572
Is it bison?
That one is.

12:41.610 --> 12:43.314
Do these pair well with an IPA?

12:43.351 --> 12:44.928
It goes well with all letters.

12:44.964 --> 12:48.180
IPA, CSI, PTA,

12:48.222 --> 12:50.767
IRS, HMO, OMG.

12:50.807 --> 12:52.085
Where are you selling these?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.505
Uh, right over there.

12:54.544 --> 12:57.387
And that's how
Dina plays the game.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.804
MAN:
Oh, yeah, totally.

12:58.839 --> 13:00.358
The definition of free-range,
you know?

13:00.393 --> 13:02.295
Let's start
with the dumpling stand.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.957
(EATING LOUDLY)

13:03.993 --> 13:05.656
Okay, how was it?

13:05.693 --> 13:08.111
Mm, I wouldn't kick it out
of bed for eating crackers.

13:08.151 --> 13:10.810
It tastes like
they actually went to the dump

13:10.850 --> 13:12.565
to get this dumpling.

13:12.602 --> 13:15.311
That's not what I said.
(MUNCHING)

13:15.352 --> 13:18.200
Woof! Someone put
a leash on this quiche!

13:18.241 --> 13:20.303
(MUNCHING)

13:20.341 --> 13:22.769
Let's not get this party tarted!

13:22.808 --> 13:24.069
(CHUCKLES, MUNCHING)

13:24.104 --> 13:26.906
These crepes gave me cramps!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.576
Hey, guys, what have
you been doing?

13:31.612 --> 13:33.021
Lying on Chowster. You?

13:33.057 --> 13:34.868
Lying to hipsters.

13:34.904 --> 13:37.887
I'm lying to myself.
I do not look good in shorts.

13:37.928 --> 13:40.643
(CROWD MURMURING)

13:40.683 --> 13:42.863
Wow, this is going
great, huh, Lin?

13:42.901 --> 13:44.142
Drunk people like hamburgers.

13:44.177 --> 13:45.754
It's not science.

13:45.790 --> 13:49.776
♪ Oh, it's hot
and wet and slick ♪

13:49.821 --> 13:53.725

14:07.070 --> 14:10.792
Ooh, thank you, everyone.

14:10.836 --> 14:16.825
And now I'd like to welcome
festival chairman Paul Blinkman

14:16.877 --> 14:20.736
to announce
the food truck winner.

14:20.780 --> 14:22.658
Hello, everybody,
it's Paul Blinkman.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.088
How we doing out there?

14:24.123 --> 14:27.340
What the hell,
@BobsBurgersFoodTruck?

14:27.382 --> 14:28.859
"More like Boo-ritos"?!

14:28.895 --> 14:30.471
Trying to spread rumours, huh?

14:30.507 --> 14:31.980
You ruined my business today.

14:32.016 --> 14:34.705
"Samosas on a Stick
will make your butt sick"?

14:34.746 --> 14:37.053
- Wait. What?
- Wow, Dad, I didn't know

14:37.092 --> 14:39.571
- you were such a mean girl.
- He's a nasty bitch.

14:39.611 --> 14:41.219
Oh, Louise, you didn't.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.089
Okay, it's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

14:44.130 --> 14:45.740
What an amazing competition
this year,

14:45.776 --> 14:48.993
and we have a winner...
it's a new truck...

14:49.035 --> 14:50.417
Bob's Burgers!

14:50.452 --> 14:53.596
(LAUGHS) Hey, Bobby!
Bob's Burgers! We won!

14:53.638 --> 14:54.671
Sorry, got to go.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.179
Whoo!

14:57.213 --> 14:59.317
Boo! Boo! Boo!

14:59.355 --> 15:01.919
(CROWD BOOING)

15:01.959 --> 15:03.898
Come on. Don't boo.

15:03.935 --> 15:06.382
Look, I'm sorry my daughter
wrote mean things about you

15:06.421 --> 15:08.232
and that we knocked off
some of your mirrors.

15:08.269 --> 15:10.947
You're the one who knocked
off my mirror? Boo!

15:10.987 --> 15:13.152
You're not even creative.
You just make hamburgers.

15:13.190 --> 15:16.107
You're the worst!
You're the worst!

15:16.148 --> 15:19.553
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what.
We won! We schooled you!

15:19.596 --> 15:21.184
I liked his burgers.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.266
And they're grass-fed,
cruelty-free soy-bison.

15:23.304 --> 15:24.947
Soy bison?
No they're not.

15:24.983 --> 15:27.029
That's what Dina said.

15:27.066 --> 15:29.051
Uh...

15:29.088 --> 15:30.815
You lied to us!
This is fraud!

- Freak! Liar!
- This is fraud!

Let's get him!

15:37.565 --> 15:39.108
you weak hippies!
Gene!

15:39.144 --> 15:41.775
Okay, maybe just the drunk guy
who barfed on his baby.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.258
(LAUGHS WOOZILY)

15:43.293 --> 15:46.309

a falafel at him! There!

Ooh, this crowd has energy!

15:49.707 --> 15:52.291

Oh, Dina, you are more trouble
than you're worth.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.095
So long, Dina.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.281
Uh, everybody, stop.
Let me...

16:09.319 --> 16:10.690
Wait! Stop!

16:10.725 --> 16:12.670
If you want to get to Bob,

16:12.707 --> 16:15.220
you're gonna have to
go through me first.

Let's get both of 'em!

What? You just turned
against me, Randy.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.898
Please, Bob. I'm not strong.

16:23.934 --> 16:27.125
(SIGHS) Fine.

16:27.167 --> 16:29.216
Whew, that was close,
but we're safe now.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.165
There's nothing
they can do to us in here.

16:31.202 --> 16:32.992
(SCREAMING)

16:39.413 --> 16:40.688

Is everybody okay?

16:40.723 --> 16:42.166
I'm okay.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.778
I can't feel my legs.
(FARTS)

16:43.814 --> 16:45.826
Oh, never mind, it's just gas.

16:45.863 --> 16:47.340
Hey, Dad, the truck's
upside down.

16:47.375 --> 16:48.986
I know, Tina.
Okay.

16:49.022 --> 16:54.543
These foodies are showing some
spine, and I like it! Again!

16:56.447 --> 16:58.006
Oh, God, we're gonna die!

16:58.042 --> 16:59.962
If I survive you, Bobby,
I won't get remarried...

17:00.000 --> 17:01.192
for two years.

17:01.226 --> 17:03.547
I don't want to die a virgin.
Me neither.

17:03.585 --> 17:04.994
Wait, that gives me an idea.

17:05.030 --> 17:06.825
No, no.

17:06.862 --> 17:09.492
I never should have given in
to this stupid food truck fad.

17:09.531 --> 17:11.577
- I miss the restaurant.
- Me, too.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.040
What is going on out there!?

17:13.076 --> 17:15.261
This was just supposed
to be a food festival.

17:18.318 --> 17:19.609
LOUISE: Holy crap.

17:19.645 --> 17:23.314
Burn, you beautiful bench, burn!

17:23.358 --> 17:27.027
Burn, you beautiful bench, burn!

17:28.783 --> 17:30.895
It's nuts out there.
I give 'em an hour

17:30.933 --> 17:32.309
till they're eating each other.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.787
I hope you're happy
with yourselves.

17:33.822 --> 17:36.068
Look what your Chowster
bullying did!

17:36.107 --> 17:38.386
Our bullying got us
a thousand-dollar check!

17:38.425 --> 17:40.169
What about Tina's lies?

17:40.206 --> 17:41.648
It wasn't me, it was Dina.

17:41.684 --> 17:43.797
It's not a lie
if you lie to vegetarians.

17:43.835 --> 17:44.909
You taught us that.

17:44.943 --> 17:46.452
I-I did teach you that.

17:46.488 --> 17:48.978
- What about your road rage, Mom?!
- Yeah!

17:49.017 --> 17:51.271
- What about it?
- It's not very good.

17:51.310 --> 17:53.823
Can we agree that Randy
is blameless here?

17:53.862 --> 17:55.032
- No.
- No. Whoa!

17:55.066 --> 17:56.180
Almost blameless?

17:56.214 --> 17:57.573
All of this started
because of you!

17:57.608 --> 17:59.169
You got me on Chowster!

17:59.205 --> 18:00.815
You told me
to come to this festival!

18:00.851 --> 18:04.535
All good advice! Look, if
it'll make you feel better,

18:04.579 --> 18:06.156
I'll do something
you tell me to do.

18:06.192 --> 18:08.539
Okay, punch yourself
in the face, you idiot.

18:08.578 --> 18:10.991
I just <i>was</i> punched
in the face...

18:11.030 --> 18:12.833
by your harsh words!

18:12.870 --> 18:15.191
Look, let's just lock
the doors, hunker down

18:15.230 --> 18:16.363
and wait this out.

18:23.948 --> 18:25.082
Mm.

18:31.464 --> 18:33.201
Talk to me, Goose.
What's going on out there?

18:33.237 --> 18:36.136
It's Lolla-pa-snooze-a-la
out there.

18:36.177 --> 18:37.637
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

18:37.673 --> 18:39.416
(PEOPLE SNORING)

18:39.453 --> 18:40.628
(QUIETLY):
Jump down, Randy.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.159
- I'm scared.
- Oh, my God.

18:43.198 --> 18:45.529
- I have weak ankles.
- Fine, stay up. (GRUNTS)

18:45.568 --> 18:46.977
I thought you were
gonna catch me.

18:47.013 --> 18:48.363
Catch you?
Why would I catch you?

18:48.398 --> 18:49.748
Boys, stop fighting!

18:49.783 --> 18:51.143
Let's do the plan!

18:51.178 --> 18:52.979
(ALL GRUNTING, TRUCK CREAKING)

18:55.546 --> 18:57.474
Yeah!
All right!

18:57.511 --> 18:59.740
No! No, no, no!

18:59.779 --> 19:01.757
No, no, no!

19:01.795 --> 19:03.379
(ALL SCREAMING)

19:04.549 --> 19:06.210
Everyone, get in!
Get in!

19:06.246 --> 19:07.471
Let's get 'em!

19:07.506 --> 19:09.568
(GRUNTING)

19:09.606 --> 19:12.236
(TIRES SQUEAL)

19:12.276 --> 19:15.359
Gene, release the grease trap.
Release the grease!

19:15.401 --> 19:16.961
(GASPING)

19:16.997 --> 19:18.005
Yes!

19:18.039 --> 19:19.900
See? I knew
it was funny!

19:19.937 --> 19:21.539
We're doing it!
We're losing 'em.

19:21.575 --> 19:24.900
- Go, us.
- Ooh. Nice grill. May I?

19:24.943 --> 19:26.754
Randy, no!
What?

19:26.791 --> 19:29.826
(SLO-MO YELL): No...!

19:36.063 --> 19:38.660
Don't worry, everybody,
only 15 miles to go.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.478
We almost had it all, didn't we?

19:40.514 --> 19:42.493
At least we didn't
lose this check.

19:42.530 --> 19:44.809
I've got half of it
right here! That's $500.

19:44.848 --> 19:46.190
That's not how it works, Gene.

19:46.225 --> 19:48.003
Yes, it is!
You're not a bank.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.800
Oh, hey, Bob, I met

19:49.837 --> 19:51.436
a really interesting
guy at the festival.

19:51.472 --> 19:53.662
He's got a holistic
glassblowing studio.

19:53.701 --> 19:55.395
You want take the
intro class with me?

19:55.431 --> 19:56.941
Oh, yeah, I do, Randy.

19:56.977 --> 19:57.951
Really?
No.

19:57.985 --> 20:00.347
- Hmm, so you lied.
- Yeah, Dad.

20:00.386 --> 20:02.226
Blow glass with Randy
and some interesting guy.

20:02.263 --> 20:03.828
That sounds great.

20:03.864 --> 20:06.227
Okay, let's play the quiet game
until we get back.

20:06.266 --> 20:09.449
Oh-ho-ho, you've done it now;
I am great at the quiet game.

20:09.491 --> 20:10.884
Okay, so start now.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.495
- Okay, I have started.
- And here we go.

20:12.531 --> 20:13.978
Well, you're already losing
'cause you just said something.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.055
I'm pretty sure I'm winning.
Obviously.

20:16.093 --> 20:17.569
What are you talking about?

20:17.605 --> 20:19.834
The whole point of the quiet
game is to stop talking.

20:19.872 --> 20:21.832
- Let's start over. Round two.
- Okay, here we go.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.013
You just lost again.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.486
- What are you talking about?
- Gene?

20:24.521 --> 20:25.533
So far, two nothing, me.

20:25.566 --> 20:27.344
You just lost.

20:27.381 --> 20:30.112
Louise,
you want to say something?

20:30.153 --> 20:32.098
Ah...
Did I win?!

20:32.135 --> 20:33.562
(CHUCKLES)
No, you just lost.
