01:03.440 --> 01:05.239
Thank... Thank you.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.639
Thanks very much.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.359
And I know that
there's a lot of people

01:09.360 --> 01:11.679
on the list to play tonight,
but I was wondering

01:11.680 --> 01:13.639
if I could just add one more.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.279
She's a friend of mine who,

01:16.280 --> 01:18.559
like me, is a long way from home.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.759
And if it's OK with you, I was
wondering if you'd like her

01:21.760 --> 01:24.599
to come up here and
play one of her songs.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.999
Is that OK? Yeah?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.926
Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

01:30.520 --> 01:32.968
Uh, just give me a moment.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.479
I think it would be a good idea if you'd
come up and sing one of your songs.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.239
It would be a really
fucking bad idea.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.559
Oh, Gretta, come on,
this is New York.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.839
- No.
- You want to hear it, right?

01:42.840 --> 01:44.319
Yeah?

01:44.320 --> 01:46.679
- Yeah?
- Yes!

01:46.680 --> 01:49.039
Sing it!

01:49.040 --> 01:50.719
You're gonna be amazing.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.639
Um, hi.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.199
Uh, so this is a new song,
so it might be kind of rough.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.639
Um... It's for anyone who's
ever been alone in the city.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.005
Thanks.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.041
See?

04:09.200 --> 04:12.080
Get up!

04:25.720 --> 04:27.919
It's 7:00am. Good morning,
New York, and welcome to

04:27.920 --> 04:31.599
the second hour of Potsy
and Andy in the Morning!

04:31.600 --> 04:33.879
Hey, Potsy, did you, uh...
did you read about the dog?

04:33.880 --> 04:36.559
- The Korean restaurant thing?
- Oh, I certainly did.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.961
Did you hear about that, Katie?

05:30.160 --> 05:33.679
Fresh prospects, let's hear it.
What do you got for me?

05:46.520 --> 05:50.119
No, no! Who's next on
this delightful journey?

05:52.400 --> 05:56.079
No, no, no, no, man. No!

05:56.080 --> 05:58.599
No, you can't... No, you can't!

06:10.000 --> 06:11.959
It's shit. It's shit!

06:11.960 --> 06:13.719
Get fucking out of my car.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.879
Give me anything, a song,
a hook, anything I can work with.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.039
I'm not asking for much.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.439
That's something. That's good.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.959
Until you started to sing.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.167
Fuck.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.925
Shit.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.199
Where's Mom?

07:01.200 --> 07:03.359
Where's my daughter?

07:03.360 --> 07:04.966
What do you mean?

07:07.800 --> 07:11.170
Your mom has a deadline.
She asked me to watch you today.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.966
Let's go.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.719
So where do you want to go,
the Museum of Natural History?

07:19.720 --> 07:21.759
You want to go to the park
and get ice cream or what?

07:21.760 --> 07:24.731
Why would I want to do that?
I'm not ten.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.766
What's that smell?

07:29.560 --> 07:32.599
Oh, that's gasoline. I was filling
up the car with gasoline,

07:32.600 --> 07:35.279
and then I spilled a
little on my pant leg.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.170
That isn't alcohol.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.079
I think I got a meeting here.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.839
You want to wait here
or you want to come?

07:47.840 --> 07:50.999
You think you have a meeting?
Do you or not?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.004
Let's see.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.199
See? This is fun, right?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.759
When we came into this neighborhood
in '92, there was nobody here.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.439
It was like a war zone.
Hookers, crack...

08:03.440 --> 08:06.889
- Now it's totally gentrified.
- I know, Dad.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.439
I've had the tour.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.759
OK, we're gonna go
up here. Just be quiet.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.919
There's more of a dynamic of...

08:13.920 --> 08:17.359
I think it's a great way to
generate revenue for the company.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.479
- Hi, um...
- Hey.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.079
Was there bad traffic?

08:22.080 --> 08:25.719
Uh, no, traffic was actually
pretty good. I was just passing by.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.959
OK, well, we were just... we were...

08:28.960 --> 08:32.159
closing up about this
audio commentary piece.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.399
Yeah, shit idea.
It was a shit idea then.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.759
Still a shit idea.
It didn't age well.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.078
Oh yeah, we...
we appreciate your candor.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.759
We had... We had a different
view of it here, though.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.359
I mean, musicians, for the most part,
are pretty much monosyllabic teenagers

08:47.360 --> 08:51.239
who really don't have that much to
say, and that's the good ones, right?

08:51.240 --> 08:54.319
So what are we doing here?
The music industry is fine.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.839
It's always gonna be fine.
We always have been fine.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.799
Maybe the kids are right.
Maybe music should be free anyway.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.359
That's an alarming thing to hear
the head of a record company say.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.604
- What? The truth?
- Well, um...

09:07.320 --> 09:09.959
- Hm. Thanks so much, Karen.
- Yeah, let me know.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.879
Uh, let's... let's talk more.
I really appreciate you...

09:11.880 --> 09:13.359
- Yeah, of course.
- ...coming by.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.239
- Thanks, guys.
- Great meeting.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.679
- Good to see you, Dan.
- I'm glad we got that figured out.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.239
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:19.240 --> 09:23.599
Bands doing audio commentary
on their own music

09:23.600 --> 09:26.919
is so fucking lame,
Saul, and you know it.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.399
Ten years ago, man,
you would've shit on that idea.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.359
It's something. It's an idea.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.599
It's something that helps keep
the lights on. It's something.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.479
We need vision, not gimmicks.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.079
- That's us.
- I've been following you, Mr. Mulligan.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.879
Down a track on every long shot

09:42.880 --> 09:44.999
you've been bringing in here
for the last five years,

09:45.000 --> 09:50.042
and which one of them
has come in? Which one?

09:55.040 --> 09:57.719
Dan. Dan!

09:57.720 --> 10:01.044
See you later, brother Saul.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.729
Dan!

10:06.760 --> 10:08.479
We need to talk, man.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.519
Come back here. Don't you
walk away from me, man.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.599
You can't do this shit, man.
You can't pull this shit, dude.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.839
You can't pull this shit!

10:16.840 --> 10:19.239
You want to do... Don't do this here.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.959
I'm gonna do it right fucking here.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.959
- Let's do it, then.
- All right, let's do it!

10:22.960 --> 10:25.199
- Because they know, they know.
- They know what?

10:25.200 --> 10:28.119
These people know that they
are sitting behind those desks

10:28.120 --> 10:31.319
because I started an
independent record label

10:31.320 --> 10:33.679
above that bar, Saul.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.759
And we changed the way that
things were gonna be done, man.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.999
- Nurture and foster.
- Things change, times change.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.641
People got to change with them, Dan.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.279
It's not working. You got to go.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.839
I don't have time for this shit, man.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.759
I got my own shit
going on, all right?

10:51.760 --> 10:54.439
I'm getting... I'm taking my
client list. I'm out of here, man.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.119
I am fucking out of here.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.879
What are you talking about?
They signed to us.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.079
Don't bother her. Don't bother her.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.439
It's not Jerry Maguire.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.161
Dad, let's go.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.959
I'm taking my art, then.
That's it, I'm taking the art.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.359
It's my art. I paid for it.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.119
I bought it. I picked it out.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.929
- I got it.
- Get away from me. Get away.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.799
- I got it, I got it.
- No, you don't. Let go.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.239
Stop it! Leave it there.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.959
I'm coming back for that.
That's mine.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.119
All of that's mine. Come on, baby.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.362
You want another one?

11:39.840 --> 11:41.479
Um, I do, but I won't.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.360
I mustn't. I can't.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.399
How could he fire me when I
set the whole fucking thing up?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.399
Did you?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.759
Don't you know anything
about your father?

11:52.760 --> 11:55.879
Yeah. I do.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.719
- I know what Mom says.
- What does Mom say?

11:58.720 --> 12:02.090
She says you're a pathetic loser.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.439
She says that affectionately.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.479
What about you? What do you think?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.319
I don't really know you.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.404
So...

12:17.880 --> 12:21.679
You know, two years is a long
time in the life of a teenager.

12:21.680 --> 12:25.880
- Where'd you learn to talk like that?
- My psychiatrist.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.919
Psychiatrist. You have
a psychiatrist now?

12:29.920 --> 12:33.599
I do. Mom thought it would be a
good idea. I was acting strange.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.919
There's nothing strange
about you, all right?

12:36.920 --> 12:40.519
You're 15 years old. You don't
need a fucking psychiatrist.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.719
Believe me, I know.
I know you better than anybody.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.799
Yeah, you sure do, Dad.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.611
How old did you say I was?

12:50.160 --> 12:53.759
Did I say you were 15?
I meant you were 14.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.810
Did I say 15?

12:59.680 --> 13:01.479
You got money to pay for these beers?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.879
I don't... I... I'm a kid.
I don't have any money on me.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.799
- What happened to your pocket money?
- I spent that on condoms.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.239
I... What?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.961
No, no, no, no, no.
Too much information.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.205
- You ready?
- For what?

13:29.200 --> 13:31.279
Ah!

13:31.280 --> 13:33.719
That was fun, right? Don't smile.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.519
- It was fun, Dad.
- Yeah. You had a good time.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.651
We haven't ran like that since
you were little. That was good.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.479
- This your daddy?
- Hey.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.279
- I'm glad you're here.
- Look away.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.286
I was just going to the car...

13:49.080 --> 13:50.959
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.919
I'm sorry. My bad.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.084
Have a great day.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.970
I could've taken that guy,
just didn't want to make a scene.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.399
Do me a favor, all right? Don't tell
your mom I lost my job today.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.479
Listen to me...

14:05.480 --> 14:08.079
Thanks for a really normal day, Dad.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.130
What?

14:11.480 --> 14:13.079
Shit.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.839
Hello, everyone.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.163
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:24.280 --> 14:28.127
- How's work?
- Uh, fine.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.970
You look hungry.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.919
Her teachers are
really worried about her.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.759
No girls like her at school.
She is distant, and basically,

14:41.760 --> 14:43.839
the only people who want
to hang out with her

14:43.840 --> 14:45.759
are older boys who want to fuck her.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.839
Oh, really? And you find
that a big surprise

14:47.840 --> 14:49.879
seeing how you let... you let
her walk out of the house

14:49.880 --> 14:53.719
looking like... I... like...
Jodie Foster from Taxi Driver?

14:53.720 --> 14:55.439
She dresses the way she wants to,

14:55.440 --> 14:57.559
and besides, any daughter
who dresses like that

14:57.560 --> 14:59.479
- only wants one thing.
- A pimp?

14:59.480 --> 15:02.999
- No, Dan, think about it.
- A daddy.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.639
That is fucking bullshit.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.839
She needs some guidance,
for fuck's sake.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.759
Well, guide her! Guide her!

15:09.760 --> 15:12.239
You waltz in here
like a fucking clown,

15:12.240 --> 15:15.479
you tell me how to raise my kid,

15:15.480 --> 15:17.999
the kid that you pick up
once a month and decide

15:18.000 --> 15:20.759
you have a fucking conscience about.
You know what?

15:20.760 --> 15:23.879
Thirty seconds after you're gone,

15:23.880 --> 15:27.204
we'll have totally forgotten
you were ever here.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.610
Thank you.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.726
Shit.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.526
Fuck.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.839
I thought there was no hope.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.839
I thought there were no answers,

16:21.840 --> 16:24.079
and then I found God.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.399
God may not always be on our time,

16:27.400 --> 16:29.879
but he's on time.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.204
Whenever you're alone... Sir?

16:34.280 --> 16:36.079
Go.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.199
Have a talk with God.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.044
Right, man. OK.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.999
I'm gonna have a little
talk with God, all right.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.559
Thank you. Thank you.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.406
What if he doesn't answer?

16:59.320 --> 17:02.079
Attention, due to a
signal malfunction

17:02.080 --> 17:04.559
at Jay Street,
the next uptown train...

17:04.560 --> 17:06.959
- Fuck.
- ...will arrive in 20 minutes.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.759
Hey. Give me a bourbon. Hurry up.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.130
- What kind of bourbon you want?
- Well, I don't care.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.119
...and I was wondering

17:32.120 --> 17:34.999
if it might be OK if she came
up here and sang a song.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.799
Is that OK? Yeah?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.601
Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

17:42.640 --> 17:44.199
Hi.

17:44.200 --> 17:48.002
So, this is a new song, so it
might be kind of rough. Um...

17:49.040 --> 17:52.079
It's for anyone who's ever
been alone in the city.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.165
Thanks.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.239
- I'm in.
- What?

21:24.240 --> 21:26.359
I want to make records with you.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.839
I want to... I want to produce you.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.359
I want to sign you.
We're meant to work together.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.439
Sorry, didn't you see what
just happened up there?

21:33.440 --> 21:35.879
Yeah, what? Are you
feeling sorry for yourself?

21:35.880 --> 21:38.959
No, I like my music. Who cares
if they don't get it, right?

21:38.960 --> 21:41.399
You just need to work on
your performance a bit.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.759
I'm not a performer, I write
songs from time to time.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.399
Are all the songs as
good as that one?

21:45.400 --> 21:49.319
Are you really an A&R man?
You look more like a homeless man.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.399
I've been celebrating all weekend,
I signed a band and we got carried away.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.879
That's some song you got there.
I promise you it could be a big hit.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.359
Plus, you're beautiful.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.399
Sorry, what's beauty
got to do with anything?

22:00.400 --> 22:03.519
- Jesus, you're tricky, aren't you?
- No, I actually just think

22:03.520 --> 22:06.479
that music is about ears, not eyes.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.319
And I'm not Judy Garland
just off a Greyhound bus

22:09.320 --> 22:12.803
looking for stardom,
but really, thank you.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.971
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.039
OK, here's the truth.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.199
I couldn't have signed you
if I wanted to, all right?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.759
OK.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.359
I didn't come from a signing tonight.
I haven't signed anybody in seven years.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.479
My label's completely
lost all faith in me.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.319
So why did you give me your card?

22:48.320 --> 22:51.399
Force of habit. If I look homeless,
it's because I practically am.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.319
I left my home about
a year or so ago.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.079
I'm sleeping on a shitty mattress
in some shitty apartment,

22:56.080 --> 22:58.119
and I wasn't celebrating tonight.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.639
I was drinking my ass off
standing on a subway platform

23:00.640 --> 23:03.999
ready to kill myself,
and then I heard your song.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.119
- Want to get a beer?
- Sure.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.090
OK, come on.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.919
"Dan Mulligan. Born 1966.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.919
Headed A&R department at
Island Records for two years.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.839
Left to cofound indie
label Distressed Records

23:18.840 --> 23:22.759
with Harvard classmate Saul Byron."
So you own Distressed Records?

23:22.760 --> 23:25.559
I sold all my interests due
to emotional difficulties.

23:25.560 --> 23:30.279
- What emotional difficulties?
- I was too emotional. Read on.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.959
"Very active on the hip-hop scene
in New York in the early '90s,

23:33.960 --> 23:35.759
the pair were responsible
for discovering

23:35.760 --> 23:40.359
numerous breakthrough artists.
Won two Grammys as producer.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.519
Lives in New York
with wife, music journalist,

23:42.520 --> 23:45.002
Miriam Hart, and their daughter."

23:46.720 --> 23:49.279
- What happened to the Grammys?
- I pawned them.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.239
You pawned them?
How much did you get for them?

23:51.240 --> 23:54.559
125 for the both of them,
which got me nice and wasted

23:54.560 --> 23:57.759
- one weekend a couple months ago.
- Were you drunk when you heard my song?

23:57.760 --> 24:00.319
Absolutely, that's when
the magic happens.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.999
- What magic?
- I hear things.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.959
- You hear things?
- Arrangements.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.759
You need to be drunk
for that sort of thing.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.559
You must've been drunk tonight,
because nobody else heard anything.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.759
No, your song's good. It's you.

24:12.760 --> 24:16.199
Standing up there like a tomboy.
I don't mean to be offensive,

24:16.200 --> 24:18.719
but don't you think that
look's a little passé?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.519
- Really?
- Seriously.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.999
We get you a look and a killer video,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.319
and you'll go straight to the top.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.679
I'm thinking Norah Jones,
singer-songwriter thing at a piano.

24:29.680 --> 24:33.639
Or the... or The Cardigans,
back in the day, when they...

24:33.640 --> 24:37.959
when they first came to America?
Maybe even Deborah Harry.

24:37.960 --> 24:42.159
A male band behind you.
What? You find that amusing?

24:42.160 --> 24:44.079
No, I'm sorry, something
went down the wrong way.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.759
Sorry? No, you were saying?
Me with a cardigan on? Norah Jones?

24:47.760 --> 24:50.479
Babe, who the fuck
do you think you are?

24:50.480 --> 24:53.359
You're gonna stand up on a
stage with a beat-up guitar

24:53.360 --> 24:55.279
and you think you're
Carole fucking King?

24:55.280 --> 24:57.519
No, I just think that an A&R man

24:57.520 --> 25:01.159
telling an artist how they should dress
or come across is total bullshit.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.239
People don't want that.
They want authenticity.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.719
OK, babe. Authenticity.

25:05.720 --> 25:11.160
Give me the name of one artist that
you think passes your authenticity test.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.599
- Dylan.
- Dylan!

25:14.600 --> 25:17.159
That is the most cultivated artist
you could've thought of.

25:17.160 --> 25:20.639
His hair, his sunglasses.
He changes his look every decade.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.399
Randy Newman.

25:23.400 --> 25:27.079
I fucking love Randy Newman.
OK? You got me on that.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.479
Listen to me.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.479
I am not saying that you can't be

25:30.480 --> 25:33.559
a real bona fide motherfucker
in this business,

25:33.560 --> 25:36.919
but you got to do whatever it takes
and get people in to see your shows,

25:36.920 --> 25:40.244
where the music can
start to do its real work.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.479
Oh, my God. What are
we even talking about?

25:44.480 --> 25:47.799
You can't sign me, and I
don't want to be signed.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.199
That's right! What's not to like?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.799
Come on, let's get out of here.

25:54.080 --> 25:58.041
Ah, shit. You're gonna have
to get these beers, though.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.799
OK, so, uh...

26:02.800 --> 26:06.799
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Oh. Where are you going?

26:06.800 --> 26:10.159
To sleep. I have a plane
to catch tomorrow.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.759
Where?

26:11.760 --> 26:14.079
- Home.
- Why?

26:14.080 --> 26:17.279
Because I'm sick of this city,
and I want to go back to Uni.

26:17.280 --> 26:20.879
Oh, come on. Come on, no one
comes to New York and just leaves

26:20.880 --> 26:24.568
without something terrible happening.
What? What happened to you?

26:26.120 --> 26:27.999
Hey.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.769
Come on, you can... you can share
with me. I'm no stranger to misery.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.519
Listen, just come to my label

26:37.520 --> 26:40.479
and let me play your
demo to my partner.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.879
If it doesn't work out, I will
personally pay to change your ticket.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.239
What's one more day in New York,
for crying out loud?

26:46.240 --> 26:48.719
You're just probably gonna go
home and mope around anyway.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.679
All right, look, I'm gonna
go home and think about it,

26:52.680 --> 26:57.210
and I'll call you either
way tomorrow. OK?

26:58.040 --> 26:59.879
- Good answer.
- Yeah.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.239
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yes, pleasure.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.239
Pleasure's mine. Hey, you...
you got my number, right?

27:07.240 --> 27:08.880
Yeah.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.599
- Hi! Dave?
- Yes.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.839
Hi. I'm Jill. I work in
hospitality at the label.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.119
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.759
- Hello. I'm Gretta.
- Nice to meet you.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.039
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.879
Right this way. Thank you, Marco.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.919
I think you're really
gonna like the apartment.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.599
- It's very high-end.
- Sorry, ladies.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.959
Hey, I... I'm sorry. Are you, um...
You're Dave Kohl.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.319
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah, I told you guys.

29:09.320 --> 29:13.279
We just, um... we saw your film the
other day. I so love your songs in it.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.719
Thank you very, very much.
This is Gretta, my girlfriend.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.639
- She writes songs, too.
- Oh, cool.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.919
Oh, would you mind taking a photograph.
That'd be so awesome.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.129
Just that button right there. Yeah.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.279
- Yeah, it's a good one.
- Thank you!

29:28.280 --> 29:30.479
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you so much, you guys.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.159
You're gonna have
to get used to that.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.159
This movie is selling
out all over town.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.359
- It's crazy.
- Unbelievable.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.761
Oh, no, it's real.

29:37.400 --> 29:41.999
All right, here we are.
We hope you like.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.399
So, uh, your fridge in
here is stocked with food.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.759
There are two sets of keys
on the table in there.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.759
This is your driver's number and my cell
phone number. I'll leave that here.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.279
You're due at the label
later this afternoon

29:54.280 --> 29:56.279
to meet everyone and say hi,

29:56.280 --> 29:57.959
then we'll take a tour
around the studio.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.359
So, probably want to catch up
on your sleep before then.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.519
So I'll leave you to it, OK?

30:03.520 --> 30:06.241
- Pleased to meet you, Gretta.
- Nice to meet you, too. Thanks.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.079
This place is a shit hole.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.249
Biggest fridge I've ever seen.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.279
Oh my God! Come here.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.439
Hey, can...

30:29.440 --> 30:31.079
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.439
Should I have come over in,
like, a week or two

30:33.440 --> 30:35.679
and let you settle in first
and get used to everything?

30:35.680 --> 30:37.679
- No.
- Are you sure?

30:37.680 --> 30:41.607
Yeah. I don't know if I could do
this without you. It's kind of scary.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.807
- Am I a wimp for saying that?
- Eh...

30:51.160 --> 30:54.519
Hey! There he is. Big Dave.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.639
What's up, kid?
How you doing, brother?

30:56.640 --> 30:59.319
- Good to see you. Gretta?
- Nice to meet you.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.479
Come on in, guys.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.919
- Put Dave at the head of the table.
- All right, I like it.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.839
- You guys, you meet everyone?
- Hi, everybody.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.439
My assistant, Mim,
the beautiful Mim. This is, uh...

31:07.440 --> 31:09.279
- ...Mildred from marketing.
- Hi.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.439
Billy there is social media.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.999
The rest of the gang
you'll meet, spend time with.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.919
So, uh, Gretta, you're gonna play guitar
on a track or two, I hope, right?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.879
Oh, yeah, sure.
I mean, if Dave wants.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.679
Yeah, Gretta and I have been writing
together for a couple years now,

31:22.680 --> 31:24.079
even before the film came along.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.879
So I would love for us to
try a couple of her songs.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.559
Did you... did you write
on the film with him?

31:29.560 --> 31:31.719
- No. No, no, no. No, I...
- No?

31:31.720 --> 31:34.119
I mean, that's the sound we're
after is from the movie, right?

31:34.120 --> 31:35.279
- Of course.
- Oui?

31:35.280 --> 31:36.919
- Yes, yes.
- Si? Capice?

31:36.920 --> 31:40.159
Yes, I just, you know... Gretta's
very much a part of the inspiration

31:40.160 --> 31:43.479
behind everything, you know,
so I just thought...

31:43.480 --> 31:47.159
She's not just my girlfriend.
We're partners almost.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.959
- I just wanted to include her.
- Um, just to be completely clear,

31:49.960 --> 31:52.479
I'm... I'm just tagging
along on this.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.799
I'm really happy to be here
and more than happy

31:55.800 --> 31:57.399
to accompany Dave
on a couple of tracks.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.119
How sweet is this girl? I love that.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.602
Whew.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.170
How great are these guys?
I love them.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.126
Rolling Stone.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.039
Yeah, thank you so much.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.319
All right, it was great
talking to you. Thanks.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.479
What's that?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.399
- That's matcha tea.
- Matcha tea?

32:37.400 --> 32:40.839
Yeah. It's got, like,
four million antioxidants in it.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.959
- Oh my God, it tastes like piss.
- I like it.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.999
Samurais used to drink it
before they went into battle.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.919
You're not a samurai;
you're a songwriter.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.319
- Well, I'm kind of like a samurai.
- Are you?

32:50.320 --> 32:53.839
- OK, bring it back to the start.
- Let me give these to the guys.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.719
Oh, hey. We got to go to
LA for a week on Monday.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.879
- We're going to LA?
- Uh, no, sorry.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.159
It's just with some label guys.
They have an office there.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.039
They want me to meet
this video director guy.

33:03.040 --> 33:06.919
But in the meantime, I'd really
like you to listen to this. So yes?

33:06.920 --> 33:09.679
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll, uh...
deliver coffee.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.286
OK.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.959
- Hey, guys, can we do this again?
- You got it, Dave. Take two.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.959
And rolling.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.685
Thank you.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.719
Oh my God!

34:53.719 --> 34:56.159
- Hello!
- Look at you!

34:56.159 --> 34:59.279
Oh my God!

34:59.280 --> 35:02.439
He has the studio for three months,
and then we go on tour,

35:02.440 --> 35:05.199
- so I think we're staying for six?
- This is unbelievable.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.239
You're total rock stars.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.959
Which studio is he working with?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.679
- Electric Lady.
- Oh, fuck off.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.199
- I know.
- Oh my...

35:12.200 --> 35:13.599
- Cool, isn't it?
- Are you serious?

35:13.600 --> 35:17.359
- So, uh, this is me.
- Aw, it's lovely.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.519
It's like that old joke. You put the key
in the door, you break a window.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.279
My God, look at all this stuff.

35:23.280 --> 35:26.319
Yeah, a lot of the studios,
uh, are upgrading.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.679
So they're practically giving stuff away.
I can record an album here soon.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.605
Well, that'd be cool.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.359
Look at you. You've got CDs.

35:34.360 --> 35:37.999
Yeah, I just phased out all
my cassettes. Have a sit down.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.719
- It's very retro of you.
- I have whiskey or water.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.119
- Whiskey, please.
- Of course you will.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.439
Look what you've got.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.479
People are going crazy for that here.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.319
When I play a show, and the people
know I went to college in Bristol,

35:54.320 --> 35:56.239
the first thing they ask is
if I know your boyfriend.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.119
Tell me about it. I'm becoming
"Dave Kohl's girlfriend" back home.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.679
I'm like, "Hello, we used to
be a team. What happened?"

36:01.680 --> 36:03.639
Ah, you know what they say,
get your songs in a movie.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.599
So this is me. This is where I've
been for God knows how long.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.199
- I love it. Yeah.
- Do you?

36:09.200 --> 36:11.159
Did you see the bed? I made that bed.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.039
That's impressive.
How do you get up there?

36:13.040 --> 36:15.439
I vault. I vault.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.719
You vault? With a pole?

36:16.720 --> 36:18.799
No, no pole. It's just, it's one...

36:18.800 --> 36:21.279
I do it in one straight,
like, one straight luge.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.959
Unless I'm drunk, in which...
in which case I...

36:23.960 --> 36:25.279
it's often a dismount.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.719
- God.
- It's the back I like.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.839
It's like he's holding a guitar,

36:29.840 --> 36:31.519
but he wants you to
think it's his penis.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.079
He's saying, "Look,
it's a guitar, but it's not.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.084
This is the actual size of my penis."

36:37.640 --> 36:38.839
Why, no?

36:38.840 --> 36:41.039
I am gonna shoot this
because you have to play that

36:41.040 --> 36:42.199
the way you just played it.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.399
OK, you play the guitar, 'cause I
can't do that when that thing's on.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.439
I will. OK, where's...

36:47.440 --> 36:50.119
- It's in G.
- I know G.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.559
- I don't like that.
- I can play G.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.239
It doesn't matter,
you have to get over this.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.239
- This is an exercise.
- Yes. Ready?

36:59.320 --> 37:01.006
Slower.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.201
Done.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.199
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

38:28.200 --> 38:30.199
I think...

38:30.200 --> 38:31.839
I think I'm angry. I think I...

38:31.840 --> 38:33.599
I think I'm mad at you
'cause it's so good

38:33.600 --> 38:35.999
that I hate you a little bit.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.559
So incredibly good.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.119
- Really?
- Yeah, what's it called?

38:41.120 --> 38:43.479
I don't know. Um, "Lost Stars"?

38:43.480 --> 38:45.359
- You like it?
- I... I don't like it.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.959
I think it's... I love it,

38:46.960 --> 38:49.319
and I think it's
incredible, and is it...

38:49.320 --> 38:52.239
Is it about... It's about me? It's not
about your other boyfriend, right?

38:52.240 --> 38:54.559
I don't know if it's about you,
but it's definitely for you.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.399
- I'll take it.
- It's your Christmas present

38:56.400 --> 38:58.639
'cause I can't afford to buy you
another one. Happy Christmas!

38:58.640 --> 39:00.119
This is the only present I want.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.279
- Yeah? Happy Christmas.
- Thank you very much.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.399
- I love you.
- I love you.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.849
Aah! Turn it off, turn it off,
turn it off, turn it off.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.206
Hi.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.007
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.199
- What... what did you do?
- Uh, nothing, really.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.239
I just kind of hung around here.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.399
I went to some botanical gardens.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.079
- Oh, really?
- It was very lovely.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.919
- Nice.
- Yeah, it was good.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.159
I wrote a new song.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.559
- Did you?
- Yeah.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.079
I was inspired in LA.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.679
- Want to hear it?
- Wow, yeah.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.119
- Would you be interested in that?
- I'd be very interested in that.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.522
- I've got it right here.
- How exciting.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.686
Fuck!

40:54.920 --> 40:56.845
What the fuck is wrong with you?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.529
You're like a fucking mind reader.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.725
Who is it for?

41:33.240 --> 41:34.399
Mim.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.119
Mim from the label, Mim?

41:36.120 --> 41:38.519
Mim...

41:38.520 --> 41:40.559
Mim, who we met...

41:40.560 --> 41:42.962
one month ago? Mim, Mim?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.881
Yeah.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.529
Was she in LA with you?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.849
Yeah. Yeah.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.043
I don't know what to say.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.641
It just happened. I...

42:08.200 --> 42:11.999
Maybe it'll go away.
Maybe it'll fade.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.687
I just... I have to see it through.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.119
Do you want to put your
head this end or this end?

42:58.120 --> 43:00.648
Obviously...

43:03.440 --> 43:05.285
Do you want a tea?

43:16.520 --> 43:19.161
I don't remember if
you take sugar or...

43:20.920 --> 43:22.759
I'm gonna wing it. I'll wing it.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.919
Please, won't you come
out with me tonight?

43:27.920 --> 43:30.199
I'm gonna play some songs
down at this open mic night.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.959
- Why don't you come with me?
- 'Cause I hate your fucking songs.

43:33.960 --> 43:37.199
All right, I think we both know
that that isn't true, so...

43:37.200 --> 43:39.919
Sorry, I didn't... No.
I... I love your songs.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.479
I'm just... I...

43:43.040 --> 43:46.479
I'm being fucking horrendous right now,
which is exactly why I need to, um...

43:46.480 --> 43:47.839
I need to go home.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.799
That's exactly why you
need to come with me.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.759
Come on. I insist.

43:51.760 --> 43:53.839
- Uh...
- Pick that up and come with me.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.319
You're coming.
I'm not leaving you here.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.724
I'll come back, I'll find your fucking
head in the oven. Come with me.

44:00.440 --> 44:03.959
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I have a friend here tonight.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.519
And if it's OK with you,
I was wondering

44:06.520 --> 44:10.119
if you'd like her to come up
here and play one of her songs.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.559
- Yeah!
- Is... is that OK?

44:11.560 --> 44:14.884
Yeah? Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

44:33.520 --> 44:35.759
- Hello?
- Hey.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.639
Were you serious last
night about signing me?

44:37.640 --> 44:39.201
Who is this?

44:39.960 --> 44:41.361
Really?

44:41.920 --> 44:45.483
I'm joking. Yeah, I was serious.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.479
I have all my suits here.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.879
Would you get me a nice suit
and make me look nice, princess?

44:50.880 --> 44:53.159
- Wait, you can't just...
- I heard a song last night,

44:53.160 --> 44:55.279
and I'm telling you,
it's exactly what that

44:55.280 --> 44:56.719
- shit-ass label needs.
- I'm glad.

44:56.720 --> 44:59.239
You can't just barge in here.
You can't come in like this.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.119
- Why?
- Uh, because that's our arrangement.

45:01.120 --> 45:03.039
- You got somebody here?
- That's not the point.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.319
We have an arrangement.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.999
- Hello!
- Stop it, will you?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.679
- Stray man! Any stray man!
- It's not funny.

45:07.680 --> 45:10.559
Don't worry about me, it's just
the husband taking a shower.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.839
- You can continue fucking my wife!
- Hey.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.079
- That's not funny.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.439
If I did, you'd be
the first I'd tell.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.199
- OK?
- Oh, so you're not.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.679
- I'll get you a shirt and a...
- No razor!

45:23.840 --> 45:27.084
Stop it. All right?

45:28.640 --> 45:33.079
You want to come in?
You want sexy time?

45:33.080 --> 45:35.164
No.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.959
OK, ready?

45:44.960 --> 45:46.559
So where are we going, Mr. A&R Man?

45:46.560 --> 45:48.919
We're going to my partner to play
him your music. Got your demo?

45:48.920 --> 45:50.839
No.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.959
- You don't have a demo?
- No.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.919
Do you have MySpace
or Facebook or anything?

45:54.920 --> 45:57.479
MySpace? No, I...
No, I don't. I just...

45:57.480 --> 46:00.959
I... You know, I told you,
I write songs from time to time.

46:00.960 --> 46:04.079
- What do you write them for?
- What do you mean, "what for"?

46:04.080 --> 46:06.119
For my pleasure and for my cat.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.239
Oh really? Does he like them?

46:08.240 --> 46:09.799
She. Yes, she seems to.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.559
- How do you know?
- Because she purrs.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.199
Maybe she's booing.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.639
No, she purrs at Leonard Cohen,
too, and she has very good taste.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.639
- Maybe she's fucking with you.
- Can we stop talking about cats now?

46:19.640 --> 46:21.559
- OK.
- OK.

46:23.640 --> 46:26.359
Fuck it. Let's do this
the old-fashioned way.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.239
Thank you, Gretta. Thanks very much.
Thanks for coming in.

46:51.240 --> 46:55.199
I'm just gonna take a moment
to talk with Dan for a minute.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.045
Thank you.

47:00.040 --> 47:02.599
I'm not into it,
it's a little undercooked for me.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.159
She seems to have kind of
an attitude problem and...

47:05.160 --> 47:07.279
What are you looking for, man?

47:07.280 --> 47:09.919
What, you want some...
some little teenage pop star

47:09.920 --> 47:12.879
whose mom's been raising her
since two years old for stardom?

47:12.880 --> 47:14.719
- I mean...
- No, that's not what I'm looking for,

47:14.720 --> 47:16.759
but if you know someone
like that, I mean...

47:16.760 --> 47:20.599
Just give me the money to make
the demo. I'll take her into the studio.

47:20.600 --> 47:24.039
Get a hot-shit producer. Get a couple
session musicians, dial the thing out.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.479
Then you can hear what I'm hearing,
and then you can tell me to fuck myself.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.559
People send us their demos.
It's not the other way around.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.359
We don't... we don't make demos.

47:32.360 --> 47:35.639
We're prospectors, man,
we're investors.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.199
We're digging for gold.

47:37.200 --> 47:41.730
Make a tape, and we'll
get back to you.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.644
That's the best I can
do right now, bro.

47:51.480 --> 47:53.719
So I've been thinking.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.964
Why do we even need
to rent a fucking studio?

47:58.680 --> 48:03.919
Because... you need a desk,
a live room and soundproofing.

48:03.920 --> 48:07.599
Laptop, Pro Tools,
a couple dynamic mics,

48:07.600 --> 48:11.079
- and the city is our fucking live room.
- You mean record outside?

48:11.080 --> 48:12.479
- That's right.
- Like where?

48:12.480 --> 48:13.919
Everywhere.

48:13.920 --> 48:18.086
Fuck him. We don't need a demo.
Let's... let's record an album.

48:18.120 --> 48:20.239
Every song we do in
a different location.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.039
All over New York City.
And we do it through the summer,

48:23.040 --> 48:25.359
and it becomes this tribute
to this beautiful,

48:25.360 --> 48:28.599
goddamn crazy, fractured
mess of a city, New York.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.679
OK, like, under the bridge
on the Lower East Side.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.199
Top of the Empire State Building.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.679
Rowing boats in the
lake in Central Park.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.599
Chinatown. Cathedral
of Saint John the Divine.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.559
OK, in the subway, in fucking
Harlem, everywhere, OK?

48:42.560 --> 48:44.759
OK, so what happens
if it starts raining?

48:44.760 --> 48:46.679
Whatever happens, we record it.

48:46.680 --> 48:49.519
- If we get arrested?
- Keep rolling. It'll be beautiful.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.490
You like it?

48:52.080 --> 48:54.319
What do you think? It's good.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.159
- It's good. Come on.
- Will you produce it?

48:56.160 --> 48:57.359
- Me?
- Yeah.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.039
No, I haven't produced
in a long time.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.239
We'll get somebody
young to produce it.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.519
- No, but I want you to do it.
- Why?

49:03.520 --> 49:05.729
Because I do.

49:06.440 --> 49:08.639
I'll give you strings,
but we definitely need piano.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.079
Fill in the guitars underneath.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.039
- Got it. I love it. Done.
- Done.

49:12.040 --> 49:15.489
The world's first Jag
mobile recording studio...

49:15.680 --> 49:17.411
is done.

49:19.040 --> 49:22.319
- It's bloody genius, it is.
- Where do you want to go?

49:22.320 --> 49:27.039
We need musicians. Terminally,
miserably bored musicians.

49:27.040 --> 49:31.399
And after that, I think, then you
bring in the violin and cello.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.079
First cello, then violin.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.439
When we get into that guitar thing,

49:34.440 --> 49:36.599
I want it to just become a
whole different kind of song.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.199
This is Malcolm.
Malcolm is a child prodigy.

49:48.200 --> 49:51.079
He's been playing violin
since he was five years old.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.239
I technically started
when I was four.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.479
Four.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.039
- Wow.
- And this is his older sister, Rachel.

49:57.040 --> 50:00.039
She's at the Manhattan School
of Music on a full scholarship.

50:00.040 --> 50:02.839
- Top-of-her-class cellist.
- That's amazing.

50:02.840 --> 50:06.359
So here's the deal. I can't
afford to pay you up front,

50:06.360 --> 50:09.959
so I want to offer you a...
a legitimate back-end deal.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.599
Sound good?

50:11.600 --> 50:13.999
Yeah, as long as it's
not fucking Vivaldi.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.359
It's not fucking Vivaldi.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.959
It's great. No, no, no.
I'm not... It's great.

50:17.960 --> 50:21.599
We definitely need piano.
Like, fill in the guitar underneath.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.526
- Major seventh...
- Got it. I love it.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.766
Steve, beautiful.

50:43.920 --> 50:46.279
- Zach, what's going on?
- I quit.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.439
- Good luck, girls.
- Bye!

50:48.440 --> 50:49.719
Keep in touch, yeah?

50:49.720 --> 50:51.159
When we get into that guitar thing,

50:51.160 --> 50:53.639
I want it to just become a
whole different kind of song.

50:53.640 --> 50:56.479
I want it to be punk meets...

50:56.480 --> 50:59.167
pop. And have some fun.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.983
Ah, he's home.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.479
Dano, what's up, man?

51:29.480 --> 51:32.719
Troublegum, my brother.
My troubles are over.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.519
- What say you give me some love?
- This is it, gangsta paradise.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.919
- Right?
- I'm glad to see you.

51:36.920 --> 51:38.239
Thanks to you, thanks to you.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.799
Come give me a hug.
I don't know you, but...

51:39.800 --> 51:42.439
That's Gretta.
Great singer and songwriter.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.039
- Let's get another one.
- Another one?

51:44.040 --> 51:46.359
Where have you been?
It's been two or three years.

51:46.360 --> 51:49.319
- I don't appreciate this shit.
- Been on the down low a little bit.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.359
- Doing this, doing that.
- Waiting for the next move.

51:52.360 --> 51:55.161
Anticipating the next groove.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.159
I know you got a lot of
shit to prove. Right?

51:58.160 --> 52:01.759
Been on the underground,
looking for that new sound.

52:01.760 --> 52:04.039
We ain't fucking around.

52:04.040 --> 52:06.839
Yeah, 'cause if it ain't
right, then it's wrong.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.439
And the road is long,

52:08.440 --> 52:12.970
and you're only as strong
as your next move.

52:14.640 --> 52:15.799
- You feel that?
- Good, man.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.359
- That's pretty much it.
- Damn, that was like some...

52:18.360 --> 52:21.079
paranormal activity type
shit moving through me.

52:21.080 --> 52:23.759
- You know me.
- I'm just so happy to see you.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.039
So nice.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.399
Fat Jimmy, did you get that down?

52:26.400 --> 52:29.079
- Yeah, I got it.
- 'Cause that was exceptionally good.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.679
Hold my hand, baby, come on.
Now, how can I help you, brother?

52:31.680 --> 52:33.039
An outdoor album?

52:33.040 --> 52:35.599
- That's right.
- That's fucking crazy.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.879
I wish I could've thought of that.
What do you want me to do?

52:37.880 --> 52:41.079
I need musicians. I need a
bass player and a drummer.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.768
- I got plenty of musicians.
- The problem is we can't pay them.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.359
Fuck it, I'll pay them.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.239
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

52:50.240 --> 52:52.719
For him, of course.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.039
- Now, come on...
- No.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.079
- Get your sexy self in the pool.
- Come on.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.959
No. Don't you touch me.
I will kill you. I will.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.399
She's English.
She's a little uptight.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.529
Yeah...

53:04.720 --> 53:07.599
- Good luck on the album, Gretta.
- Thank you.

53:07.600 --> 53:11.279
Everything you see around
here, this crib, these cars,

53:11.280 --> 53:14.599
they're all because of him,
and I don't ever forget that.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.679
- I get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

53:16.680 --> 53:18.479
You can't know.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.239
A guy like that falls on his
lip for a couple of years,

53:21.240 --> 53:24.239
people lose sight of who he is,
and they don't treat him

53:24.240 --> 53:25.479
with the respect he deserves.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.399
Hey, don't listen to anything
he's saying. It's bullshit.

53:28.400 --> 53:30.759
- Come on.
- Yeah.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.279
- Thanks.
- All right.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.479
- Bye.
- Bye.

53:34.480 --> 53:37.479
- Anything you need, OK?
- I love you, man. Thank you.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.041
I like her.

53:42.360 --> 53:45.479
Are you serious?
Are you listening to this? Really?

53:45.480 --> 53:48.919
We're gonna use it!
It's gonna be genius.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.039
- You're a genius.
- You're not listening to this.

53:51.040 --> 53:52.439
You don't hear what I hear.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.319
You're gonna make this
amazing, beautiful.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.768
- I love it.
- Got it?

54:00.280 --> 54:02.199
Those kids are gonna
be all over this track.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.170
- Come here.
- Just so you know.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.521
Take that.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.607
Little children,
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

54:16.280 --> 54:17.999
Let me see this for a second.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.679
Listen, I'm shooting
a song down here,

54:19.680 --> 54:21.359
I need you to be quiet
for five minutes.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.999
- No, thanks.
- I'll... I'll pay you.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.359
- How much?
- A buck each.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.079
- You're funny. Five dollars.
- Five bucks for all of you guys.

54:28.320 --> 54:30.479
OK, hey, OK, two bucks,
two bucks each.

54:30.480 --> 54:31.799
- No.
- No way.

54:31.800 --> 54:34.239
All right, all right,
all right, five bucks each.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.719
We're gonna do this for five bucks

54:35.720 --> 54:38.279
and five lollipops,
one for each of us.

54:38.280 --> 54:40.439
Throw in a box of
cigarettes and a lighter.

54:40.440 --> 54:43.279
I'll give you one cigarette
for each of you to smoke

54:43.280 --> 54:45.519
and you share it, and a
pack of matches, all right?

54:45.520 --> 54:47.839
- Yes.
- All right. Can you sing?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.919
Yes! Yes, that was it.

57:10.920 --> 57:12.890
Yes, it's gonna work!

57:19.440 --> 57:22.879
Oh my God, is that the Empire State?

57:22.880 --> 57:24.599
Yeah, right here.

57:24.600 --> 57:26.239
- Yeah?
- Set up here.

57:26.240 --> 57:28.639
- Get that.
- It's really good.

57:28.640 --> 57:31.319
- Yeah, it's great.
- The Wind's good, right?

57:31.320 --> 57:33.239
It's not too loud.
It's good, it's good,

57:33.240 --> 57:34.599
I think it's good.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.319
And we can look into people's
windows, which is always fun.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.999
You want to come
with me to get Violet?

57:39.000 --> 57:40.359
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, come on.

57:40.360 --> 57:43.279
- Cool.
- My brother, there you go.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.879
Thank you very much.

57:56.240 --> 57:59.007
There she is. That's her.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.199
This is Gretta. She's the songwriter
I was telling you about.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.807
- Hello. How you doing?
- My daughter, Violet.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.239
So who was the cute guy?
The one in the blue shirt.

58:22.240 --> 58:25.479
- Greg. You noticed him?
- Sure. I mean, who wouldn't?

58:25.480 --> 58:28.759
- He's gorgeous.
- He's totally out of our league.

58:28.760 --> 58:31.359
He's out of your league?

58:31.360 --> 58:34.161
Well, I mean, he didn't
look out of your league.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.931
Ignore him.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.039
How do you get someone to notice you're
ignoring them if they're ignoring you?

58:44.040 --> 58:46.439
He's not ignoring you.
You're beautiful.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.439
He knows that you're there.
He's just hedging his bets.

58:49.440 --> 58:51.559
But...

58:51.560 --> 58:54.159
I mean, you have to be really sure
that you actually like him, you know.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.999
That's it's not just that he's the
guy at school to be seen with.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.439
No, I do really like him.

58:58.440 --> 59:01.081
Well, then you have to find a
way to get him to ask you out.

59:02.200 --> 59:03.759
Yes, but how?

59:03.760 --> 59:07.687
Well, for starters, stop dressing
like you're totally easy.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.799
I thought this was sort of sexy,
it's American Apparel.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.679
No, it is sort of sexy.
It's very, very sexy,

59:15.680 --> 59:19.926
but it doesn't leave much to
the imagination, you know?

59:20.640 --> 59:22.405
I guess.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.291
You want to go shopping?

59:26.120 --> 59:27.279
I do.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.439
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:28.440 --> 59:32.322
OK, good. We're going shopping.

59:41.840 --> 59:42.999
Here you go.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.319
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.759
Good luck on the rest of your album.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.359
- It sounds cool.
- Thank you.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.879
- You have your key?
- Yep. I got it.

59:49.880 --> 59:51.879
Hey, you should come
and sing on a track.

59:51.880 --> 59:55.719
I can't sing. I can
play a bit of guitar,

59:55.720 --> 59:57.559
- if that's...
- We're doing one on Thursday.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.359
It's gonna be simple.
You should come play.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.799
Can I, Dad?

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.039
I need to... I need
to contemplate that.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.599
What are you doing?

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.604
- That ain't cool.
- What? What?

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.639
I don't know if she can play guitar
well enough to play on a track.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.079
I don't want to embarrass her.
What if she can't play?

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.562
Look, it's going to be easy.
Let her do it.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.599
Yeah?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.199
Hey, babe? Hey.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.719
- Um, where's Violet?
- Well, she's... Violet?

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.239
Listen, I was wondering, uh,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.999
you think it would be cool if
she came and played guitar

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.519
on one of these songs that
I'm recording on Thursday?

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.959
She's terrible at guitar.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.559
- Well, she's not bad.
- She's terrible.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.919
I think she'll be OK.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.119
- Well, she's...
- Yeah. 5:00, will you bring her?

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.639
I mean, that's up to you.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.119
- Yeah. I'll text you the address.
- I mean, I'll bring her.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.249
Why don't you come, too?

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.079
Mm-mm.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.239
- Come on.
- No way.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.999
Come on. Just come. It'll be fun.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.039
- I want you to come.
- I'll think about it. OK.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.759
I'll come, maybe.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.199
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.759
- Bye.
- Thank you.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.239
Bye.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.730
You know, it was nice to
see you with Violet today.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.207
- It must be hard not seeing her more.
- Yeah, it's...

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.079
So why don't you?

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.359
I mean, she obviously really
needs her father around.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.559
What, are you the fucking
social services now?

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.088
No, no, I mean, I'm just saying.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.959
It must have been fairly
tense for you to leave,

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.479
especially seeing as how much
she obviously wants you around.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.763
I... I'm gonna split.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.966
Fuck, man. Fuck that shit.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.199
Dan.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.039
Hey, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.719
What? What do you want from me?
What game are you playing?

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.599
What does that mean?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.359
Look, I just...

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.479
- What?
- I saw how sweet she was today,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.519
and I just felt sorry for
you being away from that.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.199
That is such a crock of shit.
You were back there judging me.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.119
You think that I left
that relationship

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.719
because I'm some sort
of selfish, depressed prick,

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.439
- which I am, by the way.
- No. I don't think

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.159
you're a selfish, depressed prick.
I think you've let your troubles

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.359
- get in the way of your entire life.
- Oh, babe, babe.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.199
You're really showing
your age right now.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.079
You have no idea what
happens between two people

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.999
after 18 years of
marriage, all right?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.159
And because you're willing to
hang around for some asshole

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.479
after he totally betrayed you,
that's your business.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.679
I'm sorry, you're right.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.719
I put a lot of time and effort
into that relationship,

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.319
and no, I'm not just walking away
because of a bump in the road!

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.559
"Bump in the road"?
I left that relationship

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.719
because I was having a
fucking nervous breakdown,

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.839
and she was out there
fucking some other guy,

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.919
planning how she was gonna
start a new life with him

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.399
when I was here taking
care of my kid.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.239
You have no fucking clue
what you're talking about.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.483
You know nothing!

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.919
She goes to Europe to work
on a junket, and, um...

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.879
she ends up meeting and
falling in love with a singer.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.759
Bang, boom. Thunder, lightning.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.599
Fireworks. The whole bit.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.959
And...

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.839
the arrangement was that
they were gonna come back

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.359
and tell their partners
that they'd fallen in love

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.879
and they were gonna spend
the rest of their lives together.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.919
And so, I go to the
airport to pick her up,

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.759
and she just comes out with it,
first off. Whole story.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.959
And next day,
her bags are all packed,

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.279
and we're telling Violet
what's gonna happen.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.639
So what did happen?

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.879
He choked. He got on the airplane,

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.239
went back to his life,
turned his phone off,

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.759
and she never heard from him again.
I move into another bedroom.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.239
She's waiting around for a
phone call that never comes,

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.529
and I turn into a...

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.927
I lose my shit a little bit.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.719
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.319
Maybe people in the music industry
just don't make good life partners.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.611
- Or fathers.
- Yeah, it certainly looks that way.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.799
I didn't mean about the fathers bit.
You make a very good father.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.799
- Yeah, right.
- Maybe just not a good partner.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.279
What is that?

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.439
- This?
- Yeah.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.879
- That's a splitter.
- Oh.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.559
It's for, uh, two headphones
going into one input.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.879
- Yeah.
- It's actually...

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.279
- ...from my first date with Miriam.
- It is?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.599
What do you mean?

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.119
We walked all over the city
listening to her CD player.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.439
Um...

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.879
I don't think we said more than two
words to each other the whole night.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.919
That was New Year's Eve, and we
were married two months later.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.759
Wow. That's lovely.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.650
What kind of music you
got on your phone?

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.959
I'm not giving you access to
my music library. I'm really not.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.359
There's a lot of embarrassing,
very guilty pleasures in there.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.039
Mine, too. You can tell a lot about
a person by what's on their playlist.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.679
I know you can.
That's what's worrying me.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.719
- So are we gonna do this?
- OK.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.759
OK, let's do it.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.039
This is a really good choice!

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.119
Oh, yeah.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.319
- Genius.
- Genius.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.199
- Perfect, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.079
- Great.
- Yeah.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.289
Yeah.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.199
- Oh, no, I forgot...!
- What?

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.639
OK, OK, we got to dance!

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.799
- What?
- We got to dance!

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.999
All right, all right.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.599
- Yeah, we got to...
- Where?

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.359
We got to dance.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.206
- This way, I know, I know, I know.
- This way.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.038
OK, so, I'm quite frightened,
'cause you might find this cheesy,

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.479
but it is one of my favorite songs
from one of my favorite films,

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.881
so are you ready?

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.404
It's good, right?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.038
That's what I love about music.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.359
- What?
- One of the most banal scenes

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:09.238
is suddenly invested with so
much meaning, you know?

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.759
All these banalities,

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.679
they're suddenly turned into these...

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.559
these beautiful, effervescent pearls.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.319
From music.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.283
I've got to say, as I've gotten
older, these pearls are just...

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.279
becoming increasingly
more and more rare to me.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.886
More string than pearls?

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.959
Yeah. You've got to travel
over a lot more string

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.930
to get to the pearls.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:49.519
This moment is a pearl, Gretta.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.038
It sort of is, isn't it?

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.841
All this has been a pearl.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.691
Hey, guys!

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.003
- Hi.
- Hello, Steve.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.879
Come on and check it out.
Your boyfriend just won a Music Gong.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.759
- No way.
- You won't believe it.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.559
Done something to his face.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.839
Wow, thank you so much.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.119
I'm a bit taken aback by this.
This is incredible.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.959
Uh, it just proves that a guy
from nowhere can actually make it

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.919
if he follows his dreams.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.439
I've been practicing this
speech into a shampoo bottle

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.639
in the shower my entire life. Yeah...

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.559
- Uh, gosh, thank you.
- Nice beard, you fucking loser.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.799
What dreams? We never
had those dreams.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.279
- I don't remember those dreams.
- How do you know?

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.399
Because I know him.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.879
Maybe they were private dreams.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.359
Maybe he just never
told you about them.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.359
Who was I living with
for the last five years?

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.359
Baby, you've been living
with a rock star.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.719
Only he didn't know it.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.959
It didn't matter,
but now that he does,

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.199
I've got to tell you,
these people get married to it.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.719
They fall in love with the music,
they fall in love with the lights,

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.759
they fall in love with the road,
the chicks, all that shit.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.959
And no matter how hard he tries,

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.170
he's never gonna be able
to make a woman happy.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.644
All right. See you in the morning.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.879
He just looks a dick!

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.719
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.799
Why would anyone?
I'll tell you why he'd do it.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.999
He wants to look like the guy who
doesn't realize... "I've grown a beard.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.279
I was so busy lost inside
myself writing music,

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.639
I didn't realize I'd grown a
beard the size of my neck."

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.771
I'm gonna sound quite cheesy over it.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.959
I loved him like a fool.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.119
I don't think that's cheesy. I think
that sounds like a phenomenal song.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.079
- Does it?
- Yeah, it sounds like a song.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.199
I think it sounds like a song
you should write right now.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.599
- Right now?
- Write it down.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.519
- Write it down, write it down.
- OK, OK.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.719
You're in the zone.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.439
- Say, "I'm in the zone."
- I'm in the zone.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.199
Don't say it like a
posh English girl,

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.879
- say it like someone in New York.
- Fuck off!

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.399
Say, "I'm in the fucking zone."

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.359
- I'm in the fucking zone.
- I'm in the fucking zone.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.039
I'm gonna write a song,
I don't give a shit.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.199
I'm gonna write a song.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.799
- Actually shut up.
- All right, I'm shushing...

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.319
OK, dialing.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.479
- All right, here we go.
- Speaker.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.719
Hey, this is Dave Kohl.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.999
Uh, I am probably busy doing something
awesome, so leave me a message

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.079
and I probably won't be able
to get back to you at all, ever.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.809
One more?

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.481
Hey.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.559
Everybody, this is, uh...
this is Miriam.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.719
This is Gretta.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.959
- This is my daughter, Violet.
- Nice to meet you.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.361
Come on, babe.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.319
Miriam, thank you. Thank you.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.639
It's not too high, is it?

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.879
That's not too high
for a bass. Exactly.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.519
No one should play bass
unless it's this high.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.119
You want me to set your
amp or are you good? OK.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.319
No, no, no, no, no! Hold up,
hold up, hold up, hold up...

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.639
Rachel, at the top, or...
yeah, at the top,

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.199
come in a little bit more gradually.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.479
- Fat Jimmy, come on, man.
- What's up?

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.679
- All right, man, all right.
- Police ain't gonna get you up here.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.399
Let's hear that bass, my brother.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.239
- I got you, baby, I got you.
- Come on, man.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.959
I'm sorry, wait a minute.
Um, do you play bass?

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.479
You were out of tune. You were flat.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.999
'Cause I read on the Internet
that you used to play bass.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.639
So, um, I think seeing
as we've got Violet

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.199
doing some guitar on this,
this should be a family affair.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.719
I'm a producer 'cause I
don't play bass, baby.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.479
Yes, you are... You got to do it.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.039
You got to do it...

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.039
All right, all right.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.479
Come in whenever you want,
you know? You can wait.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.039
Just, you know, keep it simple.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.919
- OK.
- You're gonna be great.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.159
- I don't even know if I'm gonna play.
- Whatever.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.439
If you feel like it, do it, OK?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.799
You know, it's totally cool.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.199
You know, but don't feel like
you have to overdo it

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.919
or prove anything.
These guys are serious musicians.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.479
Guys, can we...
Sorry. Can we take five?

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.202
All right, let's take five.
Five, not ten.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.839
Hey. I'm back in New York for a gig.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.359
I got your singing message.
I have to see you.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.525
Uh, call me. Please call me.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.199
- Turn down that motherfucking music!
- Give us three more minutes!

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.286
- I'm calling the cops!
- You're not calling the cops!

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.399
Oh my God! Oh, Violet!

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.919
And now the police!
Come on, let's go.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.919
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.519
Thank you. We should
have a toast right now.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.924
- To your album?
- To our album.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.199
- Really?
- All right. Don't get too excited.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.967
- I'm just trying it out.
- OK.

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.968
Should we toast with that?

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.559
Goddamn, how do people drink that?

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.599
We're gonna play a game, OK?

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:28.799
We're gonna play a song that
is impossible to not dance to.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.359
I defy you not to dance to this song.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.531
This is good. This is good!

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.279
You know you want to.
You know you want to!

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.685
You know you want to. So where is it?

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.719
You know you want to. You do, you do.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.359
There it is! There it is!

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.131
I'll see you.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.599
I'm gonna give them a ride home.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.839
- Cool.
- Good night.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.241
Good night.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.079
- Bye.
- Thank you for everything.

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.679
No, thank you for everything.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.879
- See you.
- Bye!

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.159
- Good night, Gretta.
- Good night, Gretta.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.189
It's gonna be awesome.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.079
So, how was touring?

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.639
Touring was amazing,
grueling, punishing,

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.327
- inspiring.
- Did you find yourself?

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.039
I don't know.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.799
You certainly found a beard,
anyway. Look at that thing.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.079
Yeah. It's... it's intense.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.050
- It's big.
- Yeah.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.919
Did Mim go with you? On tour?

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.679
You want to go straight
into this, then?

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.039
- Yeah?
- Are you...

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.919
are you the happiest couple ever?
Or did you... break up after a month

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.759
and she came back to
New York on a bus?

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.927
It was a train... actually.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.039
I'm sorry. I'm being a bitch.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.489
No. You're entitled.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.599
So... what have you been up to?

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.559
God...

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.519
It's... amazing, Gretta.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.119
- Really?
- Totally.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.808
Ambient sound, and... the city.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.439
That's it? No overdubs? Nothing?

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.119
No, no, no, it's just
the way you hear it.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.679
- God, it's so great.
- Yeah.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.559
- They're really offering you a deal?
- No... well, I don't know.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.648
He has to play it to his
partner first. So we'll see.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.839
I cannot believe what he's
done with your songs.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.279
I know. He's amazing.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.999
- You should get him to do your record.
- No, it's too late.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.959
We just finished mastering
the record in LA.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.879
I recorded in various
studios on the road.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.119
- Wow. So, what's it called?
- "On the Road."

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.288
Kind of like Kerouac.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.399
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.609
That's actually a
terrible album name.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.319
No, I...

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.719
- I mean, it worked for him.
- No. It's bad.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.479
- It's...
- I know that you know it's bad, too.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.599
No, I'm...

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.159
- you know...
- Anyway, would you like to go hear it?

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.679
- I would love to hear it.
- OK.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.644
All right... what do you think?

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.239
I think I need to listen to it again.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.639
No. No, I want... I want
your immediate reaction.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.042
- My immediate reaction?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.199
OK, um...

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.679
I... I think that you've lost
the songs in the production.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.319
You know? I mean, OK,
take "Lost Stars."

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.639
I wrote it as a... as a ballad,
and... I don't know,

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.959
- it sounds like a piece of stadium pop.
- Ooh.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.399
Yeah, but I wanted
to turn it into a hit.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.039
- Why?
- "Why?" What kind of question is that?

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.159
You're the writer.
You get sole writing credit on it.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.599
- This is huge for you.
- Yeah, but, I mean,

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.759
you weren't supposed to lose the
song in it, you know? I mean, it's...

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.639
it's delicate. I really... I just...

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.239
I think you should get it remixed.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.479
Ah, but everyone loves it
when we do it. It's amazing.

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:05.079
You have to come see it live.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.519
The reaction to it, the energy
in the room just changes.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.559
Why are you so worried about
what other people think?

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.399
It's... it's our song.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.519
It is, but, you know,
isn't that what music is about?

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.599
- It's about sharing it with people.
- No, not that song, Dave.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.919
OK, well, good, then who
do we get to remix this?

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.799
Mim. Maybe you should
get Mim to remix it.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.959
Really? OK, so this is obviously
not anything about the album.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.407
You think?

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.759
Don't. Don't become this, like,

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.759
music biz couple, you know?

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.919
Arguing about our, um... our albums.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.959
The funny thing about this is that I'd
throw that fucking record into the ocean

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.319
if we could just continue
this conversation right now.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.719
This is what I want
to talk about. OK?

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.919
And if I could somehow say
something or do anything

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.559
that would undo what
I did to us, then...

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.406
just tell me what it is. Help me.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.440
Would you?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.648
Would you throw it in the ocean?

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:06.082
Would you... would you want me to?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.159
No.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.767
No, I just, you know, I think...

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.719
I think everything's changed.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.479
And I'm... I'm just finding
it a bit hard to adjust.

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:28.119
I know. It makes sense.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.199
But we're just gonna
have to find a way to...

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.967
get through this,
get through this together.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.519
When did you, like,
when did you realize that?

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.999
When you sang to me on my voice-mail.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.639
I realized that nobody on
Earth in their right mind

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:46.159
would ever do anything remotely
like that, and... that killed me.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.919
That crushed me. You...

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.959
completely won me over.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.199
I wasn't trying to win you over,
I was trying to tell you to fuck off.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.489
And I had. And...

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.691
and now, you know, you've...
you've come back and...

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.999
and you've opened the whole thing up
again, and I think, actually, I think...

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.759
I think I'm gonna have to go.
Um, take that.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.239
I'm gonna go,
'cause it's all a bit much.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.559
I hear you. Just...

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.199
take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.959
- You're gonna stay on the bench?
- Yes, I'm gonna live on this bench.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.283
Uh-huh.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.239
Come to the Gramercy.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.439
On Saturday. Please.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.679
Just hear the song.
I want you to see...

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.163
how everyone's just falling in
love with what you created.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.209
Please don't play it like that.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.879
OK.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.801
Well, look at you. A vision of
pure class. There's my daughter.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.879
- No way.
- There it is.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.039
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.079
- There you are.
- Yeah.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.079
You look great.
Look how cool you are.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.759
Can I keep this? Show all my friends?

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.719
Hell, yeah.
That's what it's for, babe.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.919
- Look at you. Hilarious.
- Why is that hilarious?

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.719
I just had no idea you
were that talented.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.359
I mean, I just didn't know.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.519
You're, like...
you're a real guitar player.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.879
You got... you got
some talent. Seriously.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.199
What, do you want me to
start a band now, and...?

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.039
Yeah. Let's start a band.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.279
- "Let's start a band"?
- Yeah. Why not?

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.079
I'll record you. I'll produce you.

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:33.599
I like this idea.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.279
- Do you?
- Yeah.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.999
You all... motivated now?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.919
It's a family business.
It's like the Jackson Five.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.279
- There you go.
- The Mulligan Three.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.159
- You coming in?
- No. I'm gonna go...

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.319
I'm gonna go play that for Saul,
see if we can get a deal.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.041
Good luck. Let me know how it goes.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.607
I love you.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.925
I know you do.

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.001
Hey.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:09.201
Come on. Yeah. So pretty.

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.690
Bye.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.799
Thanks for coming in, guys.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.119
This is fantastic.
You got a great record.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.919
And... I missed it on the first listen,
but I don't want to miss it again.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.879
We're very glad
that you like it. So...

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.319
Well, I reached out to some
of my studio connects in LA,

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.079
and I was thinking we
can get the first track

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.599
placed in a... in a film,
the right film.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.399
There's also pilot season right now.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.479
Yeah, we're not interested
in any of that stuff.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:50.479
OK, so then... what are you
interested in? What are we doing here?

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.531
Well, I think Dan needs his job back.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:57.323
Yeah, sure. What?
Take my office. I don't care.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.199
OK, all right, so how, I mean...

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.119
I guess I want to know...
how does this work?

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.639
We put the album out,
we sell it for...?

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.679
Let's say an album
costs ten dollars a unit.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.799
The artist gets a dollar.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:13.599
Same in publishing...
it's a buck for a book.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.919
I think I'm just thinking
for this specifically...

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.199
to get my head around it...

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.559
Um, I mean, the album,
it doesn't have any overhead,

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.799
- because... we did it.
- Yeah.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.799
And then distribution, I mean,
it's not gonna go in stores,

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.519
it's gonna go online, and publicity
would be, what, word of mouth?

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.279
So I think what I'm wondering is...

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.519
why do you get nine out
of ten of my dollars?

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.879
Gretta, you're a very
smart young woman,

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.799
and, uh, you're a determined artist,

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.919
and you have a... you have
a wonderful project here.

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.799
And with the right team behind
you to push you and guide you

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.039
in the right direction and maybe hire
a producer to remix a couple tracks,

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.359
you could have a hit record
and a very long career,

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.879
but, you know, ultimately,
that's... that's up to you.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.439
Ah, you had them. You wound him up.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.479
I know. It's amazing when you're
not actually that interested,

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:03.679
you always win the hand.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.599
Yeah, that's never really
worked out that well for me.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.679
- I mean, I found it worked very well.
- Yeah.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.559
You're gonna get a deal.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.439
That asshole is gonna
give you a deal, babe.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.839
You might have to compromise
a little bit, but...

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.999
- Never.
- Of course.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.959
Hey, we should do a bunch of these.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.399
- What do you mean?
- Could do, like, the, uh...

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.239
"The European Series."

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:27.319
- I like that.
- "Paris Tapes." "Prague Sessions."

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.279
"The Berlin... Recordings."

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.999
- Yes.
- Go all over Europe by rail.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.039
We could take the whole gang.
You know?

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.523
Rachel, Malcolm, Steve.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.401
- So...
- So...

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.044
Look, I guess I'll
see you in a while.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.401
Thank you.

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.526
Thank you so much.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.919
Oh, man.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.959
Thank you.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.239
- Guitar change. All right.
- All right!

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.239
Uh, so this next song
was actually given to me

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.199
by an amazing songwriter and
an even more amazing woman.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.399
Uh, yeah. So it's a very special song...
we're gonna do her arrangement of it.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.079
So... If she's here,
I'm not sure that she is...

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.759
uh, I'd love her to come up
and join us on this one.

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.999
There's a guitar right there, so...
you know, if you're here, please...

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.559
please join us. It's a really
special song to me, so...

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.399
See your vision of this song through.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.639
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.931
- Where are you going?
- Uh... home.

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.119
- What's on your mind?
- OK, um...

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.205
I don't want your label
to release my album.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:04.919
Fine.

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.079
- Fine? Really?
- Well...

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.239
No, because I thought
that you'd be really upset.

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.719
No. It's your album.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.839
So, what do you want
to do with it, then?

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.999
- There it is.
- Yeah.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.759
That's the whole album for a dollar.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.679
A buck for a book. The whole thing.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.119
Now, once this goes out, that's it.

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.599
- They're gone.
- Yeah.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.479
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Yeah.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.079
- How about two bucks?
- You're such a capitalist.

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.679
No, a buck is fair, and then, you know,
we'll split it evenly between everyone

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.799
and Malcolm and Rachel...
everyone. Come on.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.159
Once I press this, that's it.
I'm going to war with my whole business.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.891
Mm...

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.799
That's so exciting.

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.079
- OK...
- What are you doing?

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.005
Calling reinforcements.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.559
- Whoa.
- What?

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.559
Check it out. I got Troublegum
to tweet out the album.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.559
How many followers does he have?

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.839
Apparently the entire world.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:07.519
Just about every living
human being follows him.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.359
Mr. Mulligan.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.239
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.291
News for you on the Interwebs.

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.759
- Shit.
- You didn't know nothing about this?

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.399
- No. How many did she sell?
- No?

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.879
10,000. Today.

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:26.959
- Troublegum tweeted about it.
- Man, if Troublegum helped her out,

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.719
it's because he liked her, all right?

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.999
They're artists. They're great...

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.239
- You didn't know nothing about this?
- Nothing. It's kind of funny, though.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.839
- Is it really?
- It's pretty funny, man.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.919
Boo-boo, you know
how to pick 'em, boy.

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:40.239
It's kind of good. It's good.

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.679
- It is. It's kind of epic.
- Yeah.

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.525
Clean out your locker.

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.931
See you later.
