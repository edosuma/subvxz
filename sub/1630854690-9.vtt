WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:04.003
(crickets chirping)

00:07.657 --> 00:10.158
- You look amazing.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.826
We better head down.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.178
You ready?

00:13.906 --> 00:15.922
- Just give me literally
one minute.

00:16.075 --> 00:17.474
- You okay?

00:18.093 --> 00:19.852
- More than okay.

00:19.928 --> 00:22.021
I just wanna be present.

00:22.097 --> 00:23.355
In the moment.

00:24.266 --> 00:26.483
I don't wanna forget
any of this.

00:36.853 --> 00:39.705
(indistinct chatter)

00:45.695 --> 00:46.545
(nervous sigh)

00:46.863 --> 00:49.631
(♪ Here Comes the Bride
playing on organ)

00:51.293 --> 00:53.469
(knocking on door)
I know, I'm coming!

00:55.464 --> 00:57.264
(gasping)
Ow!

01:00.452 --> 01:02.877
(screaming)

01:02.897 --> 01:04.621
(objects clattering)

01:04.640 --> 01:07.524
(struggling screams)

01:09.553 --> 01:11.695
(taser buzzing)

01:13.407 --> 01:15.365
(♪♪)

01:17.653 --> 01:19.152
- She said she'd be right down.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.747
Do you want me to go get her?
- Uh...

01:21.898 --> 01:23.582
(stammering):
I'll come with you.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.142
- Okay.
(clearing throat)

01:25.160 --> 01:26.585
- Bri?
- Briana?

01:27.980 --> 01:29.129
Briana?

01:31.984 --> 01:33.425
Briana!

01:34.336 --> 01:35.469
Briana!

01:38.157 --> 01:40.474
(ominous music)

01:43.178 --> 01:45.604
(mysterious music)

01:54.673 --> 01:56.782
(distant sirens wailing)

01:57.934 --> 02:00.202
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

02:00.955 --> 02:02.979
- I do.

02:02.981 --> 02:04.748
- We only met three months ago.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.276
But we knew from
the very first moment.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.520
- Mm, is it possible maybe
she got cold feet?

02:10.539 --> 02:14.174
- No. If she ran away,
who trashed the bridal suite?

02:14.860 --> 02:16.026
Someone took her!

02:16.044 --> 02:17.285
- Tell us about Briana.

02:17.363 --> 02:19.721
- She's a high school
arts teacher.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.867
Pay is trash, so she bartends
on the weekends.

02:23.886 --> 02:25.202
And then...

02:25.795 --> 02:27.053
And then, she uses the money

02:27.206 --> 02:28.814
to buy art supplies
for the kids.

02:28.965 --> 02:30.315
- What bar?

02:30.392 --> 02:32.042
- Morgan's.

02:32.044 --> 02:32.985
Elkins Park.

02:33.061 --> 02:35.154
- Did she say
that she had gotten

02:35.381 --> 02:36.897
in a fight at work or...?

02:37.049 --> 02:40.384
Was there anyone who objected
to her marrying you?

02:40.386 --> 02:41.718
- No, it was the opposite.

02:42.479 --> 02:45.480
Friends, family,
everyone was thrilled.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.166
- Okay, well...

02:47.242 --> 02:48.500
Thank you, Trevor.

02:48.577 --> 02:50.169
We'll reach out
when we have something.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.913
But trust me,
we'll find Briana.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.490
- Come on. I'll walk you out.

02:55.567 --> 02:56.842
And on the way,

02:56.993 --> 02:59.720
I'll let you know why you should
give me that rose.

03:00.589 --> 03:02.255
(somber music)

03:03.500 --> 03:08.002
- Okay. So, he thinks
that someone trashed the room.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.354
Maybe it was her.

03:09.506 --> 03:11.598
Right? I know if
I was having second thoughts

03:11.750 --> 03:13.750
and a bunch of people
are sitting down at the altar

03:13.752 --> 03:15.268
waiting for me,
I might break a chair or two,

03:15.362 --> 03:16.528
throw things around.

03:16.647 --> 03:18.605
- Okay, so you still
think she got cold feet.

03:18.682 --> 03:21.516
- I don't know. I don't have
enough information yet.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.203
(door closing)
- Kemi, what's your read?

03:24.354 --> 03:26.020
- That Trevor is heartbroken.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.448
If in fact it turns out
that she did cut and run,

03:28.525 --> 03:30.542
my guess is that
he joins a monastery.

03:30.619 --> 03:32.452
- All right.
Let's run Briana's financials.

03:32.529 --> 03:34.546
And to get into her e-mails,
talk to her co-workers.

03:34.698 --> 03:35.547
- Yep.
- And...

03:35.699 --> 03:38.032
- Yes?
- In case our runaway bride

03:38.052 --> 03:39.885
was actually taken...

03:39.962 --> 03:41.703
- Uh-huh?
- Issue an alert.

03:41.797 --> 03:42.537
- Yes.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.098
(alert blaring)

04:00.890 --> 04:03.891
- There were no windows
in the basement.

04:03.969 --> 04:06.578
It got so cold,
I could see my breath.

04:06.655 --> 04:09.939
I don't think the cabin
even had heat.

04:09.975 --> 04:11.399
It was remote. It was...

04:11.401 --> 04:12.809
It was probably off the grid.

04:12.828 --> 04:15.295
- Did you get a name?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.238
- She never told me.

04:17.316 --> 04:19.907
- You know how old
she was approximately?

04:20.594 --> 04:24.245
- She was older than Mom,
younger than Grandma. I...

04:24.265 --> 04:26.932
What I remember are her eyes.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.934
They were...

04:29.011 --> 04:30.510
grey and empty.

04:30.662 --> 04:33.513
- Do you know why
she was holding you?

04:33.665 --> 04:35.357
What did she want?

04:36.184 --> 04:38.110
- My blood. Every two weeks,

04:38.261 --> 04:40.670
she would put an IV in my arm

04:40.689 --> 04:44.157
and drain my blood into
one of those medical bags.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.618
Uh, it made me tired.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.453
And she gave me these vitamins.

04:48.605 --> 04:50.831
She said it would help me
make more blood.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.517
- Why, um...
Why did she want your blood?

04:53.535 --> 04:56.186
You have any idea?
- I don't know.

04:56.688 --> 04:59.464
She said I was an angel
who was gonna get my wings

04:59.616 --> 05:00.690
for my sacrifice.

05:00.709 --> 05:03.618
- Do you remember
anything else, honey?

05:03.695 --> 05:05.095
- I wasn't alone.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.864
There was a... a boy.

05:07.883 --> 05:10.142
She brought him in a few months
before I got away.

05:10.293 --> 05:12.978
Oh, we were in different rooms,
but...

05:13.129 --> 05:17.190
The vents were connected
or something.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.376
I never saw him.

05:19.394 --> 05:22.228
But after she'd go to sleep,
we whispered.

05:22.381 --> 05:24.406
He said his name was Max.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.325
He could still be there.

05:26.401 --> 05:27.901
I've should've said
something earlier,

05:27.977 --> 05:29.402
I know I should've.

05:29.479 --> 05:30.904
I was just...

05:30.998 --> 05:32.581
I was scared.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.316
God, what if he's still there?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.711
- It's okay. You're okay.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.730
We'll find him, I promise.

05:41.491 --> 05:44.751
- We need to dig into every
single missing person's case

05:44.845 --> 05:46.011
in the Tri-state area, okay?

05:46.162 --> 05:48.421
- 11 to 14 years of age
named Max.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.256
- Okay. The last two years
should do it, Mike.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.758
- Hey, look, look, look.
Hey. I get that you're excited,

05:51.910 --> 05:54.761
that you're hopeful, I am too,
but you're his parents.

05:54.838 --> 05:57.022
- Yes. And if we went
by the book,

05:57.099 --> 05:58.357
we would recuse ourselves.

05:58.508 --> 06:00.341
- We're not gonna do--
- Look. I know that it's hard--

06:00.361 --> 06:02.027
- No, no, no.
Not hard, impossible.

06:02.254 --> 06:03.436
But go ahead.
- Okay, if we did nothing,

06:03.513 --> 06:05.589
and then the person
who took Keith gets away,

06:05.607 --> 06:08.274
we would never,
ever forgive ourselves!

06:08.427 --> 06:09.868
- Look, I get that.
But you being involved

06:10.095 --> 06:11.611
could guarantee she gets away.

06:11.688 --> 06:13.372
Okay? If you catch her,

06:13.374 --> 06:15.281
a defence attorney
will use your involvement

06:15.358 --> 06:17.283
to prove the investigation
was biased.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.693
Okay? That facts were bent.

06:18.770 --> 06:21.195
That it was less of a case
and more of a vendetta.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.456
You have to let me
take point on this, okay?

06:23.533 --> 06:25.884
I'll fill you in every step
of the way. You have my word.

06:25.961 --> 06:27.469
(sighing)

06:29.798 --> 06:31.556
- Mike is right.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.600
For now, he takes point.

06:35.712 --> 06:37.378
- Guys.
- Yeah, hey.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.473
- Okay, so Trevor said
that Briana worked weekends

06:40.626 --> 06:41.625
bartending at Morgan's,

06:41.627 --> 06:43.217
but Mr. Morgan who...
(chuckling)

06:43.237 --> 06:45.595
By the by, it reminds
of this fling I once had

06:45.597 --> 06:47.313
with Mahatma...

06:47.466 --> 06:49.390
- Kemi.
- This is not the right time.

06:49.468 --> 06:54.320
Got it. Mr. Morgan said
that she quit six months ago.

06:55.323 --> 06:56.748
- Well, she lied about
her Saturday nights

06:56.975 --> 06:58.658
and then pulled a no-show
at the wedding.

06:58.810 --> 07:01.144
Maybe our blushing bride
isn't so blushing after all.

07:01.163 --> 07:03.255
- And she isn't so broke either.

07:03.406 --> 07:06.240
Six months ago,
Briana set up a C corporation

07:06.260 --> 07:07.333
called the CeramicAngel.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.744
- She made $200,000
in six months?

07:09.821 --> 07:12.839
- Probably not from slinging
margaritas at happy hour.

07:12.916 --> 07:17.102
- So, the CeramicAngel web page
describes the company

07:17.329 --> 07:19.512
as a "specialized
content creator."

07:19.665 --> 07:23.758
And among the itemized
deductions is a gym membership,

07:23.835 --> 07:26.278
which tells us nothing
but makes me insanely jealous.

07:26.429 --> 07:28.113
- Does the company
have an address?

07:28.264 --> 07:30.490
- I guess you could
call it that.

07:33.269 --> 07:36.437
Okay. Oh, wow.
(scoffing)

07:36.515 --> 07:38.198
- This is corporate
headquarters.

07:38.274 --> 07:40.292
- At least
she's got low overhead.

07:40.443 --> 07:43.687
How is somebody making 200,000

07:43.689 --> 07:45.038
creating content like this?

07:45.190 --> 07:46.798
- I don't think it's the content
the people are paying for

07:46.950 --> 07:50.710
but the outfit she's wearing
while creating the content.

07:50.787 --> 07:54.789
- Looks like our blushing bride
is a secret camgirl.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.368
- There are 86 boys between
the ages of 11 and 14

07:58.370 --> 08:00.203
who were reported missing
in the last two years.

08:00.222 --> 08:02.222
None of them named Max.

08:02.374 --> 08:04.983
Off those, 22 went missing
around the same time

08:05.134 --> 08:06.651
that Keith said Max showed up.

08:06.728 --> 08:08.636
Now, we don't know
where Keith was being held,

08:08.714 --> 08:10.638
but he said it was about
a 25-minute drive away

08:10.657 --> 08:12.716
from the convenience store
where we found him.

08:12.718 --> 08:14.384
If we assume all the other
victims were taken

08:14.386 --> 08:16.569
in that same general vicinity,

08:16.646 --> 08:19.389
we get eight kids.
And one of those eight...

08:19.783 --> 08:21.315
His name is Joseph Maxwell.

08:21.317 --> 08:24.002
- If he was reported missing,
there must be a police report.

08:24.153 --> 08:26.487
- Yeah, there is.
Filed in Jersey.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.990
Maxwell lived
in a homeless encampment

08:29.067 --> 08:30.567
right across the border.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.511
- That's it? Two pages?

08:32.738 --> 08:33.995
- He was a homeless kid.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.421
His parents are deceased.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.757
In the camp one day,
out the next.

08:38.410 --> 08:39.909
Now, the presumption
is he moved on.

08:39.911 --> 08:42.428
Only reason he was reported
missing is 'cause another kid

08:42.505 --> 08:44.505
in the camp insisted
he had been taken.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.524
- Cory Evers.

08:45.675 --> 08:46.858
- Yep. I'm on my way
to get him now.

08:46.935 --> 08:49.510
- Uh... Should we go
over what to ask him?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.437
- No, no. I got it.
- We need to make sure

08:51.590 --> 08:53.514
that we cover every base.
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:53.592 --> 08:54.991
I got it, okay?

09:01.266 --> 09:04.267
- No, no, no.
She's not that type of girl.

09:04.269 --> 09:05.693
She's, she's,
she's kind. She's sweet--

09:05.771 --> 09:08.955
- No one is saying that
she isn't any of those things.

09:09.032 --> 09:10.048
- We took a pledge.

09:10.199 --> 09:11.775
We were waiting until marriage.

09:11.777 --> 09:13.443
She's the love of my life.

09:13.461 --> 09:15.595
- Maybe you should have a seat.

09:16.615 --> 09:17.973
(Nikki clears throat)

09:19.134 --> 09:21.375
<i>- Hey, guys! Ceramic Angel here.</i>

09:21.453 --> 09:24.045
(sighing)
<i> Man, I have had a tough day.</i>

09:24.139 --> 09:25.212
<i> How about you?</i>

09:25.290 --> 09:26.731
<i> You wanna talk about it?</i>

09:26.883 --> 09:28.458
<i> If you want,</i>
<i> you can message me</i>

09:28.460 --> 09:29.717
<i> and we can connect.</i>

09:29.811 --> 09:33.646
<i> I know that when I open up,</i>
<i> I feel a lot better.</i>

09:33.799 --> 09:37.224
- You had no idea about this?
<i>(Briana): I'm sure you will too.</i>

09:37.302 --> 09:40.470
- That my fiancée
is a porn star?

09:40.488 --> 09:41.246
No, I did not!

09:41.397 --> 09:42.730
- It's a subscriber website

09:42.749 --> 09:43.973
called Fan of Yours.

09:44.067 --> 09:47.493
They have music, cooking,
um, adult content

09:47.570 --> 09:49.087
and for a price,

09:49.164 --> 09:51.256
direct contact
with the models.

09:51.407 --> 09:53.925
- Direct contact. Well, that's
a polite way to put it.

09:54.077 --> 09:56.243
- Direct contact through texts.

09:56.338 --> 09:59.264
Okay? Not in person,
it's not pornography.

09:59.415 --> 10:00.932
It's a...

10:01.009 --> 10:02.826
therapy for lonely people.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.010
- Mm-hmm.

10:04.087 --> 10:06.587
In Briana's case,
for 15,000 people.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.497
- Fif--

10:07.608 --> 10:10.257
15,000 people
watch her do this?

10:10.335 --> 10:12.669
- 15,000 people pay
to watch her do this.

10:12.687 --> 10:15.614
It's not bad because that
narrows down our suspect pool

10:15.765 --> 10:17.598
to one of her subscribers.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.767
- Ooh, that's lovely.
- Hey!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.620
- What?
- It looks lovely, but...

10:21.847 --> 10:24.289
what it says about Trevor
and Briana, not so much.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.941
Which isn't all
that surprising, actually.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.943
- Mm.
- Briana had dozens

10:29.020 --> 10:31.354
of blocked users.
Maybe one of them was,

10:31.447 --> 10:33.465
I don't know,
a possessive nutjob

10:33.541 --> 10:36.209
who couldn't stand the idea
of his secret camgirl

10:36.303 --> 10:39.045
marrying somebody else?
I don't know.

10:39.197 --> 10:41.047
- Hey, about
this rose situation...

10:41.124 --> 10:43.049
- Yeah?
- You putting in a good word

10:43.126 --> 10:44.309
for Trevor and Briana
with whomever

10:44.460 --> 10:46.478
you put in a good word with,

10:46.554 --> 10:49.722
maybe you could do that
for me with Rachel?

10:49.816 --> 10:52.466
- Please, tell me that
you called her to apologize

10:52.486 --> 10:54.060
for standing her up?

10:54.212 --> 10:55.487
- I... I did in my head.

10:55.563 --> 10:57.563
- Oh. The Orishas
are helper spirits,

10:57.640 --> 10:59.048
they're not miracle workers.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.234
- We got a hit on the alert.
Another Fan of Yours model

11:01.386 --> 11:03.310
says that Briana had a stalker.

11:03.388 --> 11:05.238
- Well, there goes
the runaway bride angle.

11:05.390 --> 11:07.073
- Someone was leaving notes
on her windshield

11:07.225 --> 11:09.726
demanding she returns
what's not hers.

11:09.744 --> 11:12.228
- Notes on your windshield
means that he's local, though.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.080
You could filter that
with the blocked users.

11:14.232 --> 11:15.915
- Yes, I can.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.367
Okay, that leaves PlaidTshirt77.

11:18.403 --> 11:20.011
Real name: Henry Starkey.

11:20.088 --> 11:22.906
He paid $47,589.

11:22.924 --> 11:26.409
That was before his account
was blocked three months ago.

11:26.411 --> 11:29.170
That is a lot of money
just to be booted.

11:29.597 --> 11:32.415
- Find Starkey, see what
he has to say for himself.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.358
- I got it.

11:33.435 --> 11:35.360
- Hey, Cory.
You're not in trouble.

11:35.937 --> 11:37.770
But a friend of yours is.

11:37.847 --> 11:39.030
Jo Maxwell.

11:39.607 --> 11:41.941
<i> - I already told</i>
<i> the cops about Max.</i>

11:42.093 --> 11:43.493
<i> They didn't care.</i>

11:44.429 --> 11:45.611
<i> Why do you?</i>

11:45.688 --> 11:47.539
<i> - My fiancée's a cop.</i>

11:47.615 --> 11:48.873
And her son was taken.

11:49.025 --> 11:51.209
We think it might be
the same person who took Max.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.786
- So, you're only looking
to get a cop's kid back?

11:53.939 --> 11:56.197
- No, no. He escaped.
We're not...

11:56.216 --> 11:57.623
We're not looking for him.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.718
We're looking for the person
who took him.

12:00.462 --> 12:02.445
And if you help us out,
there's a good chance

12:02.464 --> 12:04.872
that we could find her
and we could find Max.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.641
(sighing)

12:09.287 --> 12:10.377
- Know what a Bluetooth tag is?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.214
- Yeah. It's a small
tracking device.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.807
- 10-buck safety net.

12:15.384 --> 12:17.902
That way, us street kids
can keep track of each other

12:17.979 --> 12:19.312
on our phones.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.813
We'd put them in our shoes

12:20.890 --> 12:22.148
so we could always
find each other.

12:22.225 --> 12:24.909
- Okay.
You think you could find him?

12:25.637 --> 12:27.653
(breathing shakily)

12:27.730 --> 12:28.747
- I tried.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.751
Followed the signal
up the 611 to Berg Point.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.085
- Hmm.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.089
- It went dead after that.

12:39.075 --> 12:41.092
My fear is he did too.

12:42.912 --> 12:45.822
- You know, Bluetooth tags,
they work on a mesh network.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.617
They get the signal sent from
Wi-Fi routers and cellphones.

12:49.694 --> 12:52.345
So, if Max was taken
somewhere remote,

12:52.347 --> 12:54.330
Cory's cellphone might not
be getting a signal,

12:54.332 --> 12:57.350
but a network
of cellphones might.

12:57.426 --> 12:59.093
- And if there is no network?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.170
- I get my guy
to make us a network.

13:01.172 --> 13:02.429
- Or I have a better idea.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.190
You give me your guy's name
and then I do it.

13:04.342 --> 13:06.009
Because I'm running point
and you both agreed

13:06.011 --> 13:07.118
not to be involved.

13:07.195 --> 13:08.936
- Mike. If he can find
the signal,

13:09.014 --> 13:12.015
he can find Max. Okay?
It's our best shot.

13:12.033 --> 13:13.500
We have to try it.

13:15.870 --> 13:17.128
All right, fine.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.522
I'll work on the Briana case
until you get a location

13:19.524 --> 13:21.207
off the signal,
then you give it to me,

13:21.284 --> 13:22.542
and then I go. Understood?

13:22.694 --> 13:23.802
- You have my word.

13:23.953 --> 13:25.545
- All right.

13:26.289 --> 13:28.214
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let me just stop

13:28.291 --> 13:30.225
at the evidence locker,
pick up a few things.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.644
(birds chirping)

13:33.663 --> 13:35.480
(knocking on door)

13:37.133 --> 13:38.891
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

13:38.968 --> 13:40.877
- Detective Adebayo.

13:40.895 --> 13:42.153
Is Henry home?

13:43.973 --> 13:45.214
- I'm Henry.

13:45.216 --> 13:46.307
Is something wrong?

13:46.384 --> 13:48.051
- Tell me about Briana Williams.

13:48.053 --> 13:49.476
- I don't know who that is.

13:49.554 --> 13:52.313
Or why we had
to talk in private.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.408
- You might know her
as Ceramic Angel.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.560
- Oh, Lord.

13:57.562 --> 13:58.986
You know about that?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.580
- It's why we're talking
in private.

14:00.732 --> 14:02.582
- Oh.
(chuckling)

14:02.658 --> 14:03.583
No, I appreciate that.

14:03.735 --> 14:04.843
But Gloria knows.

14:05.236 --> 14:08.237
When she found how much money
I spent on that damn site,

14:08.239 --> 14:09.830
she about blew her head off.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.332
Or mine.

14:11.409 --> 14:14.168
Still... not illegal
last I checked.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.187
- No, but kidnapping is.

14:16.264 --> 14:18.731
Briana Williams
went missing yesterday.

14:20.101 --> 14:21.342
- Well, that's awful, but...

14:21.361 --> 14:23.677
if you think I'm somehow
involved in that...

14:23.755 --> 14:26.013
- I mean, you sent her
angry messages.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.590
Your account was blocked.

14:27.683 --> 14:29.926
There were threatening notes
left on her car.

14:29.944 --> 14:31.944
- I don't know anything
about that.

14:32.097 --> 14:33.613
I've never met her.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.782
Yeah, I said some
angry things in the chat,

14:36.859 --> 14:38.525
that's because I felt betrayed.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.044
- Because she was getting
married.

14:40.196 --> 14:41.454
- Because she was a bot.

14:41.530 --> 14:44.198
- A bot?
- I asked her in a chat

14:44.275 --> 14:46.125
what clay she liked to use.

14:46.277 --> 14:48.535
"I prefer kaolin,
it's so pearly."

14:48.555 --> 14:51.723
Then I asked her when
she started to make pottery.

14:51.799 --> 14:53.040
Same answer.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.118
What's her favourite book
or movie?

14:55.120 --> 14:57.395
"I prefer kaolin,
it's so pearly."

14:57.472 --> 14:58.897
Same answer.

14:58.973 --> 15:01.215
Like she was stuck in a loop.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.750
That's because she was.

15:02.827 --> 15:06.295
Because she wasn't a she,
she was an algorithm.

15:06.314 --> 15:09.056
The girl I thought I was pouring
my heart out to,

15:09.134 --> 15:11.225
I'd never even talked to. Once.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.078
- Yesterday between 5 to 7,
where were you?

15:14.230 --> 15:15.413
- Ham radio club.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.398
A group of us meet
every Saturday.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.144
If that's when it happened,
well, I got 10 guys

15:21.162 --> 15:23.588
who will swear
I couldn't have done it.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.425
- So, Henry's alibi checks out.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.335
If a fan took Briana,
it wasn't him.

15:29.487 --> 15:31.078
- No, I don't think
it was a fan.

15:31.156 --> 15:32.505
I went through the e-mails.

15:32.657 --> 15:35.508
Six months ago, Briana hired
somebody to grow her brand

15:35.584 --> 15:37.251
through ads, promotions,

15:37.328 --> 15:38.752
and automated client
interaction.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.104
- Okay, so bots.
- Yeah.

15:40.331 --> 15:44.667
- Sam Lindquist grew her
from 800 subscribers to 15,000.

15:44.669 --> 15:47.278
And the e-mails show
that he gets a cut-off

15:47.430 --> 15:49.930
of what each new
subscriber pays.

15:50.008 --> 15:50.949
- So, an e-pimp?

15:51.100 --> 15:52.951
But where is the motive

15:53.027 --> 15:54.118
to take Briana?

15:54.195 --> 15:55.361
He makes money when she does.

15:55.438 --> 15:56.846
- Exactly. Watch this.

15:56.939 --> 16:00.166
<i>- I have some news that I wanted</i>
<i> to share with you all.</i>

16:01.110 --> 16:02.627
<i> First, the happy news.</i>

16:02.778 --> 16:04.870
<i> I met someone and I'm in love.</i>

16:05.373 --> 16:08.524
<i> His name is Trevor</i>
<i> and we're engaged.</i>

16:09.469 --> 16:12.512
<i> Which brings me</i>
<i> to the less happy news.</i>

16:13.640 --> 16:14.955
<i> This is my last video.</i>

16:15.475 --> 16:18.551
- Now, a week ago, the golden
goose decides to call it quits.

16:18.627 --> 16:21.646
But in the e-mails,
Lindquist was livid.

16:21.797 --> 16:23.389
Even refused to post the video.

16:23.466 --> 16:26.058
Last thing that he wanted
was for her to get married.

16:26.211 --> 16:27.968
- Well, there's our motive.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.304
Uh, let's bring this e-pimp in

16:30.381 --> 16:31.881
and see if he had opportunity,

16:31.899 --> 16:34.158
along with bad teeth
and gold chains.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.326
Yep.
(Mike chuckling)

16:36.070 --> 16:37.478
- I told you on the phone.
I do weddings

16:37.572 --> 16:39.905
and I do car shows. And I do
the occasional quinceañera.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.557
That's it.
- You remember the Mitchells?

16:41.559 --> 16:45.578
Steve and Annie? He did
their daughter's bat mitzvah.

16:45.730 --> 16:49.415
It was... 500 drones
recreating the Six-Day War.

16:49.492 --> 16:52.659
It was beautiful.
He is extremely talented.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.178
- I'm not a spy.
- No, no, no.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.404
We're not trying
to spy on anyone.

16:55.423 --> 16:56.922
We are trying to find someone.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.332
Okay? There was a child
that was abducted

16:58.351 --> 17:00.351
and he's being held
somewhere very remote.

17:00.428 --> 17:02.336
- Yeah. The kid's got
a Bluetooth tag, right?

17:02.430 --> 17:03.596
And we believe
it's still active,

17:03.672 --> 17:05.189
but we can't get
close enough to detect it.

17:05.341 --> 17:06.932
I mean, we could.
We could drive around the woods

17:07.085 --> 17:09.510
for the next two years,
or your drones

17:09.529 --> 17:11.087
could cover that same
ground in what,

17:11.089 --> 17:12.088
like an hour?

17:12.090 --> 17:13.256
- Y... Yeah.

17:13.258 --> 17:14.515
- His name is Max, okay?

17:14.592 --> 17:16.200
We don't know how long ago
he was taken,

17:16.427 --> 17:18.444
but every hour that passes
reduces our chances

17:18.521 --> 17:22.022
of ever finding him.
And detecting that signal...

17:22.784 --> 17:23.933
may be our only chance.
- Yeah.

17:23.935 --> 17:25.768
We need your drones.
That's it. Simple.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.621
- Okay, look. Like, I have
the drones to cover the area,

17:28.697 --> 17:30.531
but even if I help you,

17:30.550 --> 17:32.366
you're gonna need a cellphone
for every drone

17:32.443 --> 17:33.718
in order to track the signal.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.628
So, unless you have a few
hundred phones lying around...

17:35.704 --> 17:38.181
- We do not,
but the evidence locker did.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.375
Easily a few hundred phones.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.603
- You got yourself some drones.

17:44.639 --> 17:47.482
(zipping, clattering)

17:54.741 --> 17:56.991
(sighing)

17:59.637 --> 18:00.727
- Why are you so serious?

18:00.822 --> 18:03.164
We're finally gonna catch
Keith's kidnapper.

18:04.066 --> 18:04.916
- I know.

18:05.493 --> 18:07.643
I just...
I can't help but think that

18:07.662 --> 18:11.314
she is doing to Max was she did
to Keith and that is just...

18:11.332 --> 18:13.591
almost too much to bear.

18:13.742 --> 18:15.426
(beeping)

18:17.931 --> 18:20.598
(drones buzzing loudly)

18:27.832 --> 18:29.065
Here we go.

18:31.093 --> 18:32.985
(suspenseful music)

18:40.695 --> 18:41.953
- Can I help you?

18:42.029 --> 18:44.455
- I'm here to see
Detective Sherman.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.515
- You're Sam Lindquist?

18:46.534 --> 18:48.543
- No. She is.

18:51.447 --> 18:53.965
- So, you created the bots
to what, scam people?

18:54.116 --> 18:55.616
- No, it was for fun.

18:55.693 --> 18:57.301
And it was for money.

18:57.378 --> 18:58.711
A lot of money.
(chuckling)

18:58.863 --> 19:00.972
- This isn't a joke, Samantha.

19:01.624 --> 19:02.381
- Fine. Whatever.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.142
It started because
my older sister

19:04.293 --> 19:05.959
has a big following
on Fan of Yours.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.728
- Madison's involved in this?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.539
- She's a performer.

19:10.541 --> 19:11.374
And I'm an OPM.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.484
Online personality manager.

19:13.636 --> 19:15.820
Maddy has fans
that like to talk to her.

19:15.897 --> 19:17.321
She was spending
too much time online

19:17.473 --> 19:18.805
and her grades started to slip,

19:18.825 --> 19:21.808
so I said I'd make some bots,
try to help her out.

19:21.886 --> 19:22.809
- You made bots for other women?

19:22.904 --> 19:24.220
- Like I said, it's kind of fun.

19:24.313 --> 19:27.147
You know, you've gotta develop
these personalities,

19:27.167 --> 19:29.325
learn to type like other people.

19:30.152 --> 19:31.560
Older clients are challenging

19:31.729 --> 19:34.046
'cause they like to put these
periods in their sentences.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.550
I bet you do that, huh?

19:40.238 --> 19:41.737
- What's wrong
with using periods?

19:41.756 --> 19:45.016
- Nothing. The olds are big
on periods. Yeah.

19:45.092 --> 19:46.575
And double spacing
after periods.

19:46.594 --> 19:49.336
- How did you learn
how to do this?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.414
- Guess I've always
just liked coding.

19:51.432 --> 19:54.250
- Wait, wait. Don't you feel bad
for cheating the subscribers?

19:54.677 --> 19:55.751
(scoffing)
- Cheating them?

19:55.770 --> 19:57.678
I'm not cheating them,
I'm helping them.

19:57.755 --> 20:00.698
Yeah, I mean, models can't
talk to that many subscribers.

20:00.775 --> 20:01.941
It's impossible.

20:02.093 --> 20:04.109
So, they just talk
through my bots.

20:04.262 --> 20:06.520
Fans feel special,
models feel safe,

20:06.597 --> 20:08.781
and I get paid,
so win-win-win.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.267
- Yeah, until the models
wanna retire.

20:11.269 --> 20:13.377
You stood to lose a lot
of money when Briana did.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.546
- Yeah, and I tried
to talk her out of it,

20:15.698 --> 20:17.715
but I don't kidnap people.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.384
I mean, I've got plenty
of clients.

20:20.536 --> 20:23.054
If anybody had a financial
incentive to kidnap her,

20:23.205 --> 20:24.555
it's the kidnapper.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.800
- What do you mean?
- Well, on my way over here,

20:27.876 --> 20:30.210
I get a notification saying
there's been suspicious activity

20:30.230 --> 20:32.304
on Briana's Fan of Yours
cash account.

20:32.457 --> 20:34.214
Yeah, I know.
So I tried to open it,

20:34.234 --> 20:35.733
but I guess I'm locked out.
I don't know.

20:35.810 --> 20:37.309
- All right. Well, we're
gonna have to unlock it.

20:37.462 --> 20:40.529
I'm gonna need the account
number and the access code.

20:42.725 --> 20:43.724
- I don't know, Jay.

20:44.485 --> 20:46.727
Whatever's out there,
I'm not sure I wanna see it.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.989
- Whatever it is, we will
face it together. Okay?

20:50.141 --> 20:51.582
(beeping)
- Got something.

20:51.734 --> 20:52.899
- Come on.
- No, no.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.828
I told Mike we'd let him
take it from here, okay?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.129
I gave him my word.

20:57.906 --> 20:58.589
- I know.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.483
This isn't about Mike, Nik.

21:00.501 --> 21:02.151
It's about finding the monster
that took our son.

21:02.153 --> 21:03.761
- Check it out. Yeah.

21:03.912 --> 21:06.430
- You and I both know
we can't leave this alone.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.141
(suspenseful music)

21:25.118 --> 21:27.159
(floor creaking)

21:30.364 --> 21:31.497
- Nothing.

21:38.189 --> 21:40.464
(ominous music)

22:15.818 --> 22:17.460
(♪♪)

22:33.094 --> 22:34.643
- Found the tag.

22:37.248 --> 22:38.522
- Once Keith ran...

22:39.083 --> 22:41.934
She must've known we'd get her
sooner or later.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.253
- I think we need
to bring Keith here.

22:44.755 --> 22:46.605
- That's a bad idea, Jay.

22:46.682 --> 22:49.608
- This is evil. Okay?

22:49.685 --> 22:51.494
It's gotta be stopped.

22:52.763 --> 22:53.596
(sighing)

22:53.781 --> 22:55.948
- I accessed Briana's
cash account.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.116
- And?

22:57.268 --> 22:59.118
- And it turns out
the suspicious activity

22:59.270 --> 23:01.437
was a cash withdrawal

23:01.439 --> 23:03.956
of $47,589.

23:04.108 --> 23:05.699
- The exact amount that Henry
spent on Briana?

23:05.718 --> 23:09.128
- Yup. I'll call Judge Shapiro
and get an arrest warrant

23:09.204 --> 23:11.280
so we can bring Henry in
and bring back Briana.

23:11.298 --> 23:12.781
- Yeah, about that,

23:12.800 --> 23:14.283
I don't think Henry took her.

23:14.376 --> 23:16.209
- What, you think someone

23:16.229 --> 23:19.713
just happened to demand
$47,589?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.625
- These are the text messages
that Henry sent to Briana.

23:22.627 --> 23:24.627
On the left, the ones
when it was all good.

23:24.645 --> 23:26.219
On the right, the angry ones

23:26.297 --> 23:27.630
when he was demanding
his money back.

23:27.648 --> 23:29.222
Now, the words and phrasing
are the same,

23:29.300 --> 23:31.558
but the way that they're written
is different.

23:32.227 --> 23:33.318
Now, I called Sam Lindquist.

23:33.471 --> 23:35.729
(scoffing)
Yes, my theory rests

23:35.806 --> 23:36.563
on a 17-year-old girl

23:36.824 --> 23:39.199
with an attitude problem,
but still.

23:39.234 --> 23:40.476
The extra letters,

23:40.478 --> 23:42.253
it's called
expressive lengthening.

23:42.329 --> 23:45.405
See, women at two times
more likely to do that than men.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.331
On the left,

23:46.984 --> 23:48.500
"Oh, my god,
you're so beautiful."

23:48.653 --> 23:51.320
Right, "OMG, I can't believe
what you've done."

23:51.413 --> 23:54.673
See, men spell that out.
Women, not so much.

23:54.750 --> 23:58.010
Now next, two spaces
after the period on the left,

23:58.086 --> 23:59.419
one on the right.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.772
Now, if Henry didn't write
these angry text messages,

24:01.924 --> 24:03.941
my question is, who did?

24:04.092 --> 24:04.942
(scoffing)

24:05.093 --> 24:06.018
- The only other person

24:06.094 --> 24:07.278
who wanted the money

24:07.429 --> 24:10.614
and who could access
the cash account to get it:

24:11.859 --> 24:13.742
his wife. Gloria.

24:17.773 --> 24:19.457
(whimpering)

24:20.943 --> 24:22.776
- I love weddings.

24:23.187 --> 24:24.687
I loved my wedding.

24:24.705 --> 24:26.188
I love my husband.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.048
And he loved me.

24:28.951 --> 24:29.800
Until you seduced him.

24:29.952 --> 24:31.284
(Briana whimpering)

24:31.362 --> 24:33.545
You were smart to give me
the access codes.

24:33.622 --> 24:34.805
I got what I wanted.

24:34.882 --> 24:36.289
What I deserved.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.624
And you...

24:37.643 --> 24:39.201
You got a message
to stay away from my husband.

24:39.294 --> 24:41.386
I got my life back.

24:41.463 --> 24:42.730
So now...

24:44.633 --> 24:46.609
(panicked whimpering)

24:47.987 --> 24:49.728
you get yours back.

24:50.214 --> 24:51.396
Come on, get up.

24:51.549 --> 24:52.656
It's time to go.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.993
(fighting grunts)

25:03.394 --> 25:05.077
(clattering)

25:05.171 --> 25:06.670
(fighting groans)

25:09.233 --> 25:10.966
(glass breaking)

25:12.236 --> 25:14.512
(breathing heavily)

25:17.850 --> 25:19.183
(glass breaking)

25:19.927 --> 25:21.727
(panting furiously)

25:26.359 --> 25:28.025
I need a hand with something.

25:28.102 --> 25:29.418
- Can it wait 'til after
the game, hun?

25:29.436 --> 25:31.362
- I woke up at 5 a.m.,
cooked your breakfast,

25:31.438 --> 25:33.255
made your bed and washed
your laundry.

25:33.257 --> 25:35.257
And all the while,
you sat on your ass!

25:35.259 --> 25:37.276
Now, I'm asking for help.

25:37.352 --> 25:40.520
And no, it cannot wait
until after the game, hun!

25:40.598 --> 25:42.614
- Okay, okay. I'll help.

25:43.117 --> 25:44.583
What's gotten into you?

25:45.527 --> 25:46.961
Is that blood?

25:47.529 --> 25:49.505
(ominous music)

25:51.050 --> 25:53.050
(sighing)

26:00.284 --> 26:01.466
I don't understand.

26:01.619 --> 26:02.968
W... What happened?!

26:03.120 --> 26:04.469
- It's your floozy!
The pottery girl!

26:04.546 --> 26:06.546
- Yeah, I know who it is,
Gloria!

26:06.566 --> 26:07.623
Why is she here?

26:07.641 --> 26:08.957
What the hell did you do?!

26:08.959 --> 26:10.067
- I do what you fail to do.

26:10.260 --> 26:11.810
I've got our retirement
money back!

26:11.962 --> 26:13.195
- Oh, my god.

26:13.981 --> 26:15.297
Is she dead?

26:15.316 --> 26:17.466
- I was about to let her go
but she attacked me.

26:17.468 --> 26:18.725
I defended myself!

26:18.744 --> 26:21.470
- Do you realize the police
are looking for her?!

26:22.306 --> 26:25.065
This is insane!
- Don't you dare, Henry!

26:25.142 --> 26:28.160
You fell for this idiot
and gave her all our money!

26:28.570 --> 26:29.920
You created this mess.

26:29.997 --> 26:31.663
I just tried to clean it up!

26:31.740 --> 26:32.906
You said you wanted to save
our marriage.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.427
That's what you told me,
God and Dr. Meyer.

26:36.578 --> 26:40.080
So, unless everything you said
in couples therapy was a lie,

26:40.099 --> 26:42.141
you will help me.

26:42.827 --> 26:43.767
Understand?!

26:43.919 --> 26:45.010
- Help you how?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.396
- We have to get rid
of the body!

26:49.424 --> 26:51.025
(door creaking)

26:52.761 --> 26:54.194
- It's okay.

26:59.526 --> 27:02.995
- House is totally clear, buddy.
Nobody's here. It's just us.

27:05.015 --> 27:06.198
(floor creaking)

27:06.350 --> 27:09.184
- I used to hear that at night.

27:09.462 --> 27:13.130
Above me, when she walked,
the floor was creaking.

27:14.358 --> 27:16.282
It's like the house was alive.

27:17.211 --> 27:19.786
- This room, does it look
familiar to you?

27:19.864 --> 27:21.121
Keith, uh...

27:21.790 --> 27:23.674
Do we have the right place?

27:23.826 --> 27:26.477
- I didn't spend
much time up here.

27:27.221 --> 27:29.104
Downstairs is
where we were kept.

27:32.877 --> 27:34.151
- Hey.

27:34.228 --> 27:36.378
You don't have to go down there.

27:36.397 --> 27:37.613
- It's fine.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.658
If it helps find Max.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.245
(ominous music)

27:52.746 --> 27:53.962
This is it.

27:54.489 --> 27:55.673
This is it.

27:58.903 --> 28:00.994
- Hey. You okay?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.138
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
Trust me.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.428
- You said you talked to each
other through a vent?

28:10.080 --> 28:12.022
- Yeah, he was in
the next room over.

28:12.099 --> 28:13.415
(sighing)

28:13.934 --> 28:17.403
- There is no next room over.
His room was over there...

28:19.014 --> 28:20.489
- Doesn't make any sense.

28:35.606 --> 28:37.131
(door creaking)

28:43.447 --> 28:44.596
Hey, what is it?

28:45.299 --> 28:47.015
- I think I found Max.

28:47.618 --> 28:48.633
(tense music)

28:48.786 --> 28:49.643
- Police!

28:53.290 --> 28:55.023
- Living room clear!

28:56.660 --> 28:58.694
(distant officers shouting)
- Clear!

29:09.898 --> 29:11.707
(tense music)

29:20.909 --> 29:23.318
- Did you see their cellphones?
- No.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.429
- Okay. Let's get a tracer
on them.

29:25.506 --> 29:27.413
Whatever happened here,
hopefully they panicked

29:27.433 --> 29:28.915
and forgot to toss them.
- Okay.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.843
- Rachel and C are still
at the cabin, okay?

29:31.996 --> 29:33.178
CSI is there.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.588
If there is a lead to be found,
they will find it.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.274
(cellphone vibrating)

29:37.425 --> 29:38.591
- It's Mike.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.352
<i> Hey.</i>
- It wasn't Henry.

29:40.428 --> 29:41.670
It was his wife.

29:41.672 --> 29:43.096
Or at least we think it was.

29:43.173 --> 29:44.356
<i> We got a track</i>
<i> on their cellphones.</i>

29:44.508 --> 29:46.116
- Loop me in and send me
the location.

29:46.193 --> 29:47.117
I'll meet you there, okay?

29:47.194 --> 29:48.343
<i> - Hey, uh, the signal.</i>

29:48.345 --> 29:50.012
Did Jay's guy find it?

29:50.014 --> 29:51.346
- Yeah, he did.

29:51.439 --> 29:53.290
- Okay, great. Send me a text
message of the location

29:53.441 --> 29:55.383
and we'll get a Tac Team
as soon as we can.

29:55.385 --> 29:57.277
- That won't be necessary. I...

29:57.296 --> 29:59.630
(sighing)
<i> Oh, Mike, it was horrific.</i>

30:01.133 --> 30:02.874
- You gave me your word, Nik.

30:02.951 --> 30:04.051
- I know...

30:04.545 --> 30:05.451
- Your word.

30:05.696 --> 30:09.598
- And part of me wishes
that I kept it.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.226
- And the other part?

30:13.628 --> 30:15.729
- Wishes that you understood
why I didn't.

30:23.230 --> 30:25.564
(panting)
- This is insane.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.116
- You want sane?
Don't cheat on your wife.

30:29.477 --> 30:30.494
Okay, it's enough.

30:30.645 --> 30:31.570
Now, go get her.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.572
- We're never gonna get
away with this.

30:33.648 --> 30:36.208
- Not if you don't stop
whining, we won't.

30:39.321 --> 30:41.321
(gasping, muffled screaming)
- Oh! Oh!

30:41.340 --> 30:42.581
Holy Mother of God, she's alive!

30:42.733 --> 30:45.092
(gasping frantically)

30:50.407 --> 30:52.424
(panicked breaths)
It's okay! You're okay!

30:52.500 --> 30:53.258
Can you breathe?

30:53.410 --> 30:54.351
(out of breath): I don't know...

30:54.502 --> 30:56.002
Where am I?

30:56.021 --> 30:58.246
No! No! Get away from me!

30:58.248 --> 31:00.006
- Easy, I'm not gonna hurt you!

31:00.025 --> 31:01.841
- Oh, dear God, shut up, Henry!

31:01.919 --> 31:03.343
- We have to get her
to a hospital.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.921
- So she can ID us
to the police? I don't think so.

31:05.923 --> 31:08.574
- Just let me go! I'm not gonna
tell anybody, I promise!

31:08.759 --> 31:10.350
- That ship has sailed, honey.

31:10.444 --> 31:12.594
I know this is hard,
but at this point,

31:12.613 --> 31:14.096
we're short on options.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.748
Henry, step away from her.
- Wha... What are you gonna do?

31:16.900 --> 31:19.951
- Move away from her, Henry.
- Gloria, you can't do this.

31:20.104 --> 31:21.786
- I can and I will.
Now move!

31:21.863 --> 31:23.696
- I won't.
- Stop taking her side!

31:23.774 --> 31:25.382
- I'm not taking her side!

31:25.459 --> 31:26.717
(sobbing): I didn't mean
to hurt anybody!

31:26.944 --> 31:29.052
- I can't believe after
all of this, you choose her?!

31:29.087 --> 31:30.053
- I'm not choosing her!

31:30.130 --> 31:31.704
- Then get away from her!

31:31.724 --> 31:32.948
I won't ask a--
(gunshot)

31:32.950 --> 31:34.741
(gasping)

31:35.060 --> 31:36.685
(scream of terror)

31:44.144 --> 31:46.311
(Briana): Help!
Somebody help me!

31:47.239 --> 31:49.297
- Hey, Jason.
Uh, Henry has been stationary

31:49.316 --> 31:52.058
for the last 20 minutes.
It looks like he's on the corner

31:52.136 --> 31:53.485
of Roscoe and Belden.

31:53.561 --> 31:55.637
<i> - On my way.</i>
- Yeah, we'll see you there.

31:56.306 --> 31:58.807
Hey, uh, when we meet Jason,

31:58.825 --> 32:00.400
try not to bite his head off.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.643
- They're gonna blow
Keith's case.

32:01.645 --> 32:03.828
- Mike, it's an impossible
situation.

32:03.981 --> 32:05.647
If I was Nikki,
I wouldn't have been able

32:05.666 --> 32:07.983
to sit on the sidelines either.
- She doesn't see it.

32:08.001 --> 32:10.243
Or she doesn't want to.
Neither of them do.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.078
- Is that what
this is really about?

32:12.156 --> 32:13.413
The case?

32:13.933 --> 32:15.098
- What else would it be about?

32:15.175 --> 32:16.433
(scoffing)

32:16.660 --> 32:19.828
- Her and Jason being on
one side and you on the other?

32:20.330 --> 32:22.347
Look, blended families are hard.

32:22.499 --> 32:25.500
And no matter what, you know,
they could be doing nothing.

32:25.593 --> 32:27.593
And it wouldn't make any sense.
There's gotta be times

32:27.671 --> 32:29.279
that you feel like
you're the odd man out.

32:29.356 --> 32:31.690
- No. Has nothing
to do with that.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.341
And no, I don't.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.268
- Saying you're never jealous?

32:35.287 --> 32:36.119
- No.

32:36.196 --> 32:37.696
- Nervous?
- No.

32:37.848 --> 32:39.347
- Worried?
- Absolutely not.

32:39.441 --> 32:41.083
- Okay. Then act like it.

32:45.856 --> 32:47.130
That's Henry's car right there.

32:47.282 --> 32:49.424
(suspenseful music)

32:59.979 --> 33:01.052
- All right. Lead the way.

33:01.629 --> 33:04.648
- If there's any friendly fire,
leave me out of it.

33:05.209 --> 33:06.650
He's dead ahead.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.989
Oh, God. It's Henry!

33:16.053 --> 33:16.901
His pulse is weak.

33:17.237 --> 33:18.811
He's lost a lot of blood.
(distant gunshot)

33:19.406 --> 33:21.814
- All right, call 911 and meet
them by the road, all right?

33:21.892 --> 33:22.833
Let's go.

33:22.909 --> 33:24.743
(gunshot)
- Give up!

33:24.895 --> 33:26.128
Because I won't!

33:27.731 --> 33:29.214
(panting)

33:37.591 --> 33:41.518
Honestly, I don't know
what Henry saw in you

33:42.187 --> 33:44.095
other than a pretty face.

33:44.172 --> 33:45.430
- I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.266
I love Trevor.
He's all I care about.

33:48.384 --> 33:50.694
- Then you shouldn't
have led on my husband.

33:50.845 --> 33:52.220
- I'm sorry!

33:52.756 --> 33:53.922
- Oh, you will be.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.491
- Gloria, put the gun down.

33:57.685 --> 33:59.427
Drop the gun right now.

33:59.446 --> 34:00.686
- Of course.

34:00.764 --> 34:02.539
Treat me like the bad guy here.

34:02.616 --> 34:05.483
I'm not the one selling
delusions and fantasies.

34:06.361 --> 34:09.621
She destroyed my marriage,
my life!

34:09.773 --> 34:11.364
I'm just returning the favour!

34:11.383 --> 34:13.458
- I know you're angry,
I know you're upset,

34:13.610 --> 34:15.293
and more than that, you're hurt.

34:15.445 --> 34:17.387
And you feel betrayed
by somebody you care about.

34:17.464 --> 34:18.704
I get it, I do.

34:18.782 --> 34:20.223
But you can't let Henry's
failings turn you

34:20.300 --> 34:22.517
into something you're not:
a killer.

34:23.303 --> 34:25.020
(whispering): I shot him.

34:26.306 --> 34:27.455
I shot Henry.

34:27.474 --> 34:30.525
- We got to Henry, okay?
We're helping him.

34:32.053 --> 34:34.220
Look, I'm putting the gun away.

34:34.298 --> 34:36.481
All right?
What happens next?

34:36.633 --> 34:38.633
You shoot her, shoot my partner
and you shoot me?

34:38.635 --> 34:40.893
Gloria, look at me.
Look at me. It's over.

34:40.971 --> 34:42.137
It's over.

34:42.230 --> 34:42.913
Give me the gun.

34:43.064 --> 34:44.155
(panting)

34:44.232 --> 34:45.490
Put the gun down.

34:45.492 --> 34:47.142
No, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey!

34:47.144 --> 34:47.992
(Briana screaming)

34:48.145 --> 34:48.977
(gunshot)

34:48.995 --> 34:50.087
- Come here. You're okay.

34:50.163 --> 34:51.588
You're okay. Shh! You're okay.

34:51.739 --> 34:52.738
You're okay.
(Gloria sobbing)

34:52.816 --> 34:53.481
You're all right. It's over.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.317
Shh. I know, I know, I know.

34:55.319 --> 34:57.168
I know, I know.
It's over. Come on.

34:57.671 --> 35:00.413
- I thought I was doing
post-mortem on one victim.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.507
- You were.
Things have changed since then.

35:02.659 --> 35:03.658
And for the worse.

35:03.660 --> 35:05.084
- You could've called
and told me.

35:05.253 --> 35:07.679
Kind of like you would if you
agreed to have dinner with me

35:07.755 --> 35:09.164
then didn't show up.
Oh, wait.

35:09.182 --> 35:11.182
- Yeah, well, about that--
- Look. I get it.

35:11.259 --> 35:13.685
Sometimes I come on strong
and it can spook guys.

35:13.761 --> 35:16.279
But you could've been honest
instead of stringing me along.

35:16.431 --> 35:19.007
I'm an adult. I can handle it.

35:19.025 --> 35:20.450
(stammering): I... I...

35:20.527 --> 35:22.953
(sighing)
- Let's just get this done

35:23.029 --> 35:24.287
and get this over with.

35:24.364 --> 35:26.206
I've got a date in two hours.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.351
Hey.
- Cadaver dog got a hit,

35:29.353 --> 35:30.943
so we called up
the recovery team.

35:31.021 --> 35:32.295
- That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

35:32.447 --> 35:33.855
(sighing)
We found a few more sites

35:33.874 --> 35:36.024
with soil disturbances,
so we rolled out

35:36.026 --> 35:38.042
the ground-penetrating radar.

35:38.195 --> 35:40.119
- How many bodies
have you found?

35:40.197 --> 35:41.263
- Three...

35:42.382 --> 35:43.531
So far.

35:43.533 --> 35:45.475
(ominous music)

35:51.132 --> 35:53.150
(indistinct radio chatter)

35:53.301 --> 35:54.651
- What the hell happened?

35:54.728 --> 35:55.986
(sighing)
- Cadaver dogs found

35:56.062 --> 35:57.988
five more sets of human remains.

35:58.139 --> 35:59.972
13 to 14-year-old males.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.886
Initial exams show that
they were possibly malnourished.

36:04.905 --> 36:06.830
Dental work is practically
non-existent.

36:06.907 --> 36:10.000
- You think there were living in
the street like Jo Maxwell was?

36:10.076 --> 36:11.626
- Yeah, I do.

36:13.397 --> 36:15.005
- So, we got an M.O.:
someone who likes

36:15.081 --> 36:16.173
to prey on homeless kids.

36:16.324 --> 36:19.325
- And that someone,
a serial killer.

36:19.994 --> 36:21.236
(sighing)
- Look, that room

36:21.254 --> 36:22.587
with the scalpels and the IVs,

36:22.739 --> 36:25.089
it appears as though each
of them were the subjects

36:25.242 --> 36:26.758
of some sort of surgical
procedure.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.852
It might've been the cause
of death. I don't know.

36:28.929 --> 36:30.078
It's too soon to tell.

36:30.096 --> 36:31.671
- C, bring the bodies
to the morgue

36:31.748 --> 36:33.248
for Rachel to identify, okay?

36:33.266 --> 36:35.250
- Yeah.
- I'll go with him.

36:35.252 --> 36:37.843
We find out who they are
and inform the families.

36:37.921 --> 36:38.987
- Thank you.

36:39.847 --> 36:40.530
Hey.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.426
I know that you don't think
I should be here.

36:44.428 --> 36:46.686
- Yeah, Kemi thinks that
I'm jealous of you and Jay.

36:47.188 --> 36:48.446
That I'm nervous and worried.

36:48.598 --> 36:49.539
She thinks that's
the real reason

36:49.616 --> 36:51.357
why I don't want you
working the case.

36:51.435 --> 36:52.542
- Is that the real reason?

36:52.694 --> 36:54.936
- She says that blended
families are hard.

36:55.363 --> 36:57.029
And that it's only natural
that I feel like

36:57.049 --> 36:58.215
the third wheel sometimes.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.959
- Mike, if I have done anything
to make you feel that way--

37:01.111 --> 37:02.293
- No, no, you haven't.

37:02.446 --> 37:04.537
And Jay hasn't, and I don't.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.297
- So, that's not why

37:06.374 --> 37:07.891
you don't want us
working the case?

37:08.042 --> 37:09.059
- Of course it is.

37:09.135 --> 37:10.894
- That doesn't make any sense.

37:10.971 --> 37:11.895
- She said that too.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.457
Kemi is annoyingly perceptive.

37:15.459 --> 37:16.549
But...

37:16.626 --> 37:18.142
what does make sense,

37:18.295 --> 37:20.052
the only thing that makes
perfect sense

37:20.722 --> 37:22.555
is that you and Jay
do everything possible

37:22.632 --> 37:24.724
to find the person
that took your son.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.744
And nobody should keep you
from doing that.

37:27.895 --> 37:29.537
Least of all, me.

37:34.068 --> 37:35.660
(indistinct chatter)

37:35.812 --> 37:37.462
(computer beeps)
<i> - Hey, guys.</i>

37:39.165 --> 37:41.483
<i> Wow, this is gonna be hard.</i>
<i> Um...</i>

37:41.501 --> 37:43.167
- No, no. I really
don't wanna see this.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.095
- No, I get it, I get it.

37:45.947 --> 37:47.155
Briana had a secret.

37:47.749 --> 37:50.658
A part of her that
she didn't share with you.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.160
It's easy to see that
as a deal-breaker

37:52.178 --> 37:53.770
in a relationship.

37:53.847 --> 37:57.089
But I think that if you watch
the rest of this video,

37:57.109 --> 37:59.526
you will understand
why it's not.

38:01.262 --> 38:02.670
(sighing)
- Okay.

38:02.672 --> 38:04.430
(computer beeps)
<i> - I have some news</i>

38:04.449 --> 38:06.992
<i>that I wanted to share with you.</i>

38:07.935 --> 38:09.844
<i> I met someone.</i>

38:09.863 --> 38:11.346
<i> I'm in love!</i>

38:11.364 --> 38:15.033
<i> His name is Trevor and um...</i>

38:15.109 --> 38:16.293
<i> we're engaged.</i>

38:17.037 --> 38:21.022
<i> Which does bring me</i>
<i> to the less happy news.</i>

38:21.024 --> 38:23.207
<i> This is my last video.</i>

38:24.528 --> 38:27.453
<i> But I just... I wanted</i>
<i> to thank you for everything.</i>

38:28.365 --> 38:31.641
<i> And I really hope</i>
<i> that you all find someone</i>

38:31.793 --> 38:35.729
<i> who makes you as happy</i>
<i> as Trevor makes me.</i>

38:36.631 --> 38:38.565
- You're a lucky man.

38:39.634 --> 38:40.984
Now, go tell her that.

38:41.135 --> 38:43.528
(reflective music)

38:45.215 --> 38:46.531
(whispering): Yeah.

38:47.734 --> 38:49.034
Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:54.558 --> 38:55.623
Mm...

38:56.409 --> 38:57.834
(door closing)

38:57.985 --> 38:59.151
- That was sweet.

38:59.412 --> 39:02.246
- For them, yes. For you,
I was hoping instructional.

39:02.732 --> 39:05.091
I heard it didn't go
so well with Rachel.

39:06.327 --> 39:09.070
Briana didn't tell Trevor
her truth

39:09.072 --> 39:12.265
because she thought that
she would lose him if she did.

39:13.259 --> 39:15.685
- And you think
she was an idiot?

39:15.837 --> 39:17.245
- Total moron.

39:17.338 --> 39:20.431
- Okay, so, I've been
a total moron.

39:20.584 --> 39:22.692
- You're too kind.
On yourself.

39:22.844 --> 39:25.603
- I stood you up for dinner,
I never explained why.

39:25.755 --> 39:27.105
- Which was super lame.

39:27.181 --> 39:28.272
- And then, I ghosted you.

39:28.349 --> 39:30.425
- Dear God, can you skip
your greatest hits

39:30.443 --> 39:32.518
and get to your apology already?

39:32.596 --> 39:35.872
- I just, in the past,
when I've let people

39:35.949 --> 39:37.374
get to know the real me,

39:37.525 --> 39:40.251
it hasn't always worked out
and I just...

39:41.771 --> 39:43.195
It's made me a little gun-shy.

39:43.273 --> 39:44.288
(chuckling): What are you,

39:44.365 --> 39:45.957
like a secret fascist
or something?

39:46.109 --> 39:47.092
- No!

39:49.054 --> 39:50.220
No, I...
(sighing)

39:51.539 --> 39:55.207
But there is something that
I need you to know about me.

39:55.301 --> 39:57.042
- Let me guess. Um...

39:57.787 --> 39:59.954
You don't go to movies
or concerts.

39:59.973 --> 40:01.881
You get overstimulated.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.124
- No.

40:03.217 --> 40:04.976
Yes. Yes, but no.

40:05.128 --> 40:06.385
That...

40:06.405 --> 40:07.645
that's not what
I'm trying to say.

40:07.797 --> 40:08.646
- Well, what then?

40:08.965 --> 40:10.481
You can only order takeout
through an app

40:10.634 --> 40:12.316
and drive-thrus
are tough for you?

40:12.469 --> 40:14.911
I know about
your social anxiety.

40:14.988 --> 40:16.996
- I'm a trans man.

40:18.141 --> 40:19.457
And I just...

40:20.310 --> 40:22.168
I didn't know if you knew.

40:24.481 --> 40:26.714
Um... And...

40:27.984 --> 40:32.077
Yeah, I hate drive-thrus
and fabric softeners

40:32.097 --> 40:34.914
and um,
contrary to popular opinion,

40:34.991 --> 40:38.726
I thought Game of Thrones
was overrated, so...

40:44.000 --> 40:45.442
- Okay. I...

40:46.945 --> 40:48.069
Yeah.

40:50.173 --> 40:52.991
That is, uh... a problem.

40:53.510 --> 40:54.284
- Yeah.

40:55.512 --> 40:58.455
- But how do you feel
about House of the Dragon?

41:03.203 --> 41:06.037
- Okay, well, um, I...

41:06.631 --> 41:09.207
I don't know, I think
House of the Dragon is um...

41:09.283 --> 41:10.133
(chuckling)

41:10.284 --> 41:13.094
Well...
- You really are a moron.

41:26.209 --> 41:27.375
- Hey.

41:27.393 --> 41:29.319
All right. ME's office
identified the bodies

41:29.395 --> 41:30.487
and none of them are Max.

41:30.638 --> 41:32.739
The other six families
have been notified.

41:33.808 --> 41:35.066
- So, Max is still out there

41:35.235 --> 41:38.828
but we're no closer to finding
him or Keith's kidnapper.

41:38.980 --> 41:39.829
- Maybe we are.

41:39.981 --> 41:41.146
All these boys,

41:41.166 --> 41:42.557
they were identified
that they lived

41:42.650 --> 41:44.225
in different encampments.
They all come from

41:44.244 --> 41:45.076
different cities,
but I did find

41:45.152 --> 41:46.227
one thing they had in common.

41:46.229 --> 41:47.395
They all received
medical treatment

41:47.455 --> 41:49.488
from a health clinic
called Cradle Mobile.

41:49.566 --> 41:51.824
- You think that someone that
worked for that organization

41:51.843 --> 41:53.234
may be who we're looking for?

41:53.236 --> 41:54.585
- I don't know. Maybe.
But I got a list

41:54.662 --> 41:56.237
of all the doctors who worked
the mobile cites

41:56.330 --> 41:57.329
in the last seven years.

41:57.407 --> 41:59.090
I got names, I got photos.

41:59.242 --> 42:00.725
I really wanna show it to Keith.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.061
(ominous music)

42:04.931 --> 42:06.748
- You know,
the person is in there.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.400
But if you don't remember,
it's okay.

42:22.857 --> 42:24.499
- This her?

42:25.526 --> 42:26.709
- That's her.

42:27.862 --> 42:29.504
Beth Colt.

42:31.032 --> 42:32.632
She's the monster that took me.

42:40.300 --> 42:43.101
- You believe in heaven,
don't you, Max?

42:44.896 --> 42:45.728
- I don't know.

42:46.790 --> 42:50.733
- Heaven is a happy ending
for those who do noble deeds.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.903
When you think about it
like that,

42:53.980 --> 42:56.130
death isn't so scary.

42:56.149 --> 42:57.532
- Please...

42:58.243 --> 42:59.576
I just wanna go home.

42:59.652 --> 43:02.996
- The Lord calls us
all home eventually.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.808
Now, I want you
to get some sleep.

43:06.826 --> 43:08.743
You've got a big day
tomorrow.

43:09.070 --> 43:10.461
Okay?

43:24.585 --> 43:26.227
(breathing shakily)

43:27.272 --> 43:27.995
(gasping)

43:28.014 --> 43:29.347
(heart monitor beeping)

43:29.499 --> 43:30.589
It's perfect.

43:30.667 --> 43:32.567
Steady, strong.

43:33.260 --> 43:34.760
Just like my Noah.

43:34.838 --> 43:36.337
(chuckling)

43:36.339 --> 43:41.433
Though... it would help
if you'd try to relax, dear.

43:41.511 --> 43:44.954
- Please. I don't understand
why I'm here.

43:45.849 --> 43:47.698
What do you... what do you
want from me?

43:47.851 --> 43:49.033
- Oh, it's not about
what I want.

43:49.185 --> 43:50.960
It's about
what Noah needs.

43:51.630 --> 43:54.856
My son. He's about your age.

43:54.874 --> 43:56.691
- There's another boy here?

43:56.693 --> 43:59.861
- He was asking about you
just this morning.

43:59.879 --> 44:02.046
He called you
his guardian angel!

44:02.198 --> 44:04.057
(woman laughs)

44:05.459 --> 44:07.226
Would you like to meet him?

44:11.966 --> 44:14.192
(breathing shakily)

44:18.806 --> 44:22.575
He's... fragile now. Resting.

44:23.828 --> 44:26.496
So you'll have to keep
your voice down.

44:32.896 --> 44:36.297
Noah. Sweetheart,
are you awake?

44:37.734 --> 44:39.250
I've brought you a visitor.

44:39.326 --> 44:43.137
- What's wrong with him?
- His heart is broken.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.473
He needs a new one.

44:46.667 --> 44:50.019
But thanks to you,
today is his lucky day.

44:52.765 --> 44:54.982
Bless you, child.

45:00.423 --> 45:03.424
- Here's what we know.
The remains of six young men

45:03.443 --> 45:05.109
were found at a cabin
in Hyde Park.

45:05.261 --> 45:07.186
Joe Maxwell
wasn't one of them.

45:07.205 --> 45:10.022
CSI's still on site,
but we have to assume

45:10.099 --> 45:12.875
that he's alive and Beth Colt
still has him.

45:13.027 --> 45:14.693
- So everything Colt
told the clinic

45:14.754 --> 45:16.120
that she volunteered at
was a lie.

45:16.272 --> 45:20.365
The medical license, name,
address, all falsified.

45:20.385 --> 45:23.553
- And the only thing that's real
on that screen is her photo,

45:23.629 --> 45:27.164
which we ran through the AMA's
physician master file database.

45:27.242 --> 45:29.283
Her real name
is Elizabeth Coulter.

45:29.302 --> 45:32.729
She's a trauma surgeon.
NYU class of '04.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.638
- Single mother,
a flourishing career

45:34.791 --> 45:36.791
until her seven-year-old son
Noah was diagnosed

45:36.809 --> 45:38.217
with Amyloidosis.

45:38.294 --> 45:41.053
It's a disease that causes
multi-system organ failure.

45:41.130 --> 45:43.889
She tried getting him
on every transplant list,

45:43.967 --> 45:45.724
but he did not qualify because--

45:45.802 --> 45:47.485
- Because they don't give
a kidney to a kid

45:47.637 --> 45:49.746
who'll need a lung
three months later.

45:49.897 --> 45:52.139
It's... heartbreaking.
- And confusing.

45:52.141 --> 45:54.325
Her son dies,
she goes off the grid,

45:54.477 --> 45:57.920
she changes her ID and then just
starts killing other kids? Why?

45:57.997 --> 45:59.905
- For a start, I don't think
her son is dead.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.591
- Amylodoisis is incurable.

46:01.667 --> 46:04.409
- I don't think he's cured,
I think he's not dead.

46:04.429 --> 46:07.154
The autopsy results
on the bodies found at the cabin

46:07.173 --> 46:10.007
show that all six died
of exsanguination,

46:10.084 --> 46:13.160
and that's not even
the most upsetting part.

46:13.179 --> 46:16.230
Uh, this is the most
upsetting part.

46:17.834 --> 46:19.183
- Organ removal.

46:19.335 --> 46:22.427
- Yeah, each victim had at least
one vital organ removed.

46:22.505 --> 46:23.687
Heart, liver, kidney.

46:23.764 --> 46:25.931
- So you're saying
that she's harvesting organs

46:25.950 --> 46:27.617
from kidnapped kids
to keep her son alive?

46:27.768 --> 46:29.527
- I'm not not saying that.

46:29.603 --> 46:31.512
- Halothane is a banned
anesthetic.

46:31.531 --> 46:33.105
- Banned, but not
out of circulation.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.516
I know people who still use it.

46:35.535 --> 46:37.960
Mob doctors,
back alley surgeons...

46:38.112 --> 46:42.281
Halothane is more cost-effective
than the legal stuff,

46:42.300 --> 46:46.877
so almost every bargain basement
bottom dweller uses it.

46:47.030 --> 46:49.472
Although... I think
it's highly unlikely

46:49.549 --> 46:53.643
that they're gonna offer up
their suppliers to a cop.

46:53.719 --> 46:55.369
- How about to a patient?

46:55.963 --> 46:58.815
- Mr. Jones.
Glad you came in today.

46:58.966 --> 47:00.632
It says here you want
a nose job.

47:00.652 --> 47:03.394
- Yeah, um,
it's obviously not cosmetic.

47:03.546 --> 47:06.230
I have a deviated septum.
- Did you want to take care

47:06.382 --> 47:07.715
of the hairline
while we're at it?

47:07.733 --> 47:09.400
- What's wrong with my hairline?
My hairline's perfect.

47:09.518 --> 47:10.993
- Maybe give
the cheekbones a boost.

47:11.145 --> 47:12.978
We're currently doing
a two-for-one deal.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.832
- On cheekbones? Huh...
People do one cheekbone?

47:15.983 --> 47:18.893
- I'm just saying that I can
help you with whatever you need.

47:18.895 --> 47:20.744
- Well, uh, clearly,
I need a lot,

47:20.897 --> 47:23.005
so how much for
the two-for-one deal?

47:23.232 --> 47:25.949
- It's a 650 deposit.
We take E-Pay.

47:26.102 --> 47:27.492
There's a barcode
on the paperwork there,

47:27.494 --> 47:29.679
it's standard stuff if you want
to take a moment to read--

47:29.906 --> 47:31.997
- Alright, well, here's what
I'm gonna do instead.

47:32.016 --> 47:35.167
I'm gonna, uh,
read you your rights.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.078
I'm with the Philadelphia
Police Department.

47:37.096 --> 47:39.355
You just earned yourself
10 to 24 months.

47:39.432 --> 47:41.524
And I know you like a deal,
so I can knock that down

47:41.675 --> 47:45.010
maybe 10 percent if you tell me
who your halothane supplier is.

47:45.029 --> 47:48.030
You got 10 seconds, 10, 9...
- Fine.

47:48.941 --> 47:50.758
But you didn't hear
any of this from me.

47:50.776 --> 47:51.850
- Mm-mm.

47:51.870 --> 47:54.778
(sighs)
- There's three local suppliers.

47:54.855 --> 47:57.248
(dramatic music)

48:05.942 --> 48:07.508
(door banging)

48:10.555 --> 48:11.554
(grunts)

48:18.137 --> 48:20.229
- I need you to listen
to me very carefully,

48:20.306 --> 48:22.139
'cause I'm only gonna
say this one time.

48:22.141 --> 48:24.125
I'm not here as a cop,
I'm here as a father.

48:24.127 --> 48:28.812
What you sold, you sold to
a woman who abducted my son.

48:28.965 --> 48:30.147
<i> Her name's Elizabeth Coulter.</i>

48:30.299 --> 48:32.241
<i> I need to know</i>
<i> where I can find her,</i>

48:32.468 --> 48:33.801
<i> and I need to know right now.</i>

48:33.803 --> 48:35.803
- Sad story.
- Is it?

48:35.821 --> 48:40.416
- I wish I could help.
- You don't. Uh, but you will.

48:42.328 --> 48:46.005
Maybe... Maybe you're just
camera shy.

48:49.485 --> 48:51.576
- I know what you're thinking.

48:51.596 --> 48:54.246
But a child is being
harvested for parts.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.158
Jay is doing his best
to keep that from happening.

48:57.176 --> 48:58.917
- Doing the wrong thing
for the right reasons

48:58.995 --> 49:00.828
is still doing the wrong thing.

49:01.180 --> 49:04.014
- Mike...
- But what I'm thinking is...

49:04.167 --> 49:06.442
I don't really have
a better idea.

49:07.094 --> 49:09.928
- It's the scumbag
in room three.

49:09.948 --> 49:11.338
Coulter had him send
the halothane

49:11.432 --> 49:14.508
to a shipping and receiving
warehouse in Callowhill.

49:14.527 --> 49:16.035
- You have an address?

49:20.774 --> 49:21.958
- I hate stakeouts.

49:22.109 --> 49:23.942
You want to act,
you feel this urgency,

49:23.962 --> 49:25.610
but all you can do is wait.

49:25.688 --> 49:27.046
- I hate them
for another reason.

49:28.374 --> 49:31.801
- Ken was a good dude.
- Great partner. My friend.

49:31.877 --> 49:34.086
After he was killed...

49:34.864 --> 49:37.381
those were some dark days.

49:37.791 --> 49:39.475
- Not so dark too, on the couch.

49:39.702 --> 49:41.885
- You were supposed to stay over
to help me grieve.

49:42.038 --> 49:45.723
- Well, I did. Sex is a way
to cope with grief.

49:46.300 --> 49:49.026
- Then we did a copious amount
of coping, then.

49:50.546 --> 49:52.655
- Whatever happened
to that couch?

49:52.806 --> 49:54.565
- I don't know.

49:54.717 --> 49:56.492
It was a nice couch, though.

49:56.643 --> 49:57.618
- Yeah.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.329
(suspenseful music)

50:04.502 --> 50:07.244
- There she is.
The woman who took Keith.

50:07.897 --> 50:09.563
- I'll get closer,
get a positive ID.

50:09.582 --> 50:11.090
You go around the back.

50:21.761 --> 50:23.352
(door buzzing)

50:25.765 --> 50:27.398
Hey, hey, hey!

50:29.085 --> 50:31.235
Hey, please, open this up.

50:33.272 --> 50:35.031
(door buzzer sounding)

50:43.766 --> 50:45.166
(truck honking)

51:06.806 --> 51:09.065
(gasping)

51:15.481 --> 51:16.989
Nikki!

51:25.566 --> 51:27.291
(phone ringing)

51:38.412 --> 51:39.470
Nikki!

51:44.493 --> 51:46.393
(gasping)
- Hello, can you hear me?

51:47.847 --> 51:50.439
Please. Please, wake up.

51:54.837 --> 51:57.196
- Max?
- Yeah.

51:58.116 --> 51:59.598
How did you know?

51:59.600 --> 52:02.526
- My name is Nikki.
I'm a police officer.

52:02.678 --> 52:05.012
I've been looking for you.
- She was just here.

52:05.030 --> 52:07.181
She said she was coming
right back.

52:07.199 --> 52:10.033
- Is she alone?
Have you seen anyone else?

52:10.186 --> 52:12.002
(door opens)

52:14.615 --> 52:16.966
- Good. You're awake.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.952
- What are you doing?
- Just a mild sedative.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.454
- Wait.
- It'll make you feel better.

52:22.473 --> 52:27.268
- You don't have to do this.
Beth. I'm a police officer.

52:28.037 --> 52:29.979
I know about your son.

52:30.648 --> 52:34.266
That you want to save him,
right? But at what cost?

52:34.894 --> 52:36.377
- I won't bury my child.

52:36.395 --> 52:41.198
- Because of that, six other
mothers had to bury theirs.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.976
I was almost number seven.
- Oh, my God.

52:44.996 --> 52:46.570
- You held my son.

52:46.722 --> 52:50.166
- Yours was the one
that got away. How poetic.

52:51.002 --> 52:54.395
These transplants
require a lot of blood.

52:54.413 --> 52:56.505
Your son was a steady supply.

52:56.582 --> 52:57.673
- You had no right.

52:57.824 --> 53:00.918
- I never took more
than he could handle.

53:01.495 --> 53:05.255
Still, his was a noble deed.

53:06.258 --> 53:09.760
But now here you are,
in his place,

53:09.836 --> 53:11.245
ready to do the same.

53:11.263 --> 53:16.358
Of course, open heart surgery
is much more extensive.

53:17.436 --> 53:19.844
We'll likely have
to bleed you dry.

53:19.864 --> 53:22.531
(muffled grunting)

53:39.124 --> 53:41.124
- I don't care if the vice
president is in town, okay?

53:41.201 --> 53:42.701
I don't care
if it's the president.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.035
I don't care if it's the pope,

53:44.129 --> 53:45.704
I don't care if it's
the ghost of Queen Elizabeth.

53:45.781 --> 53:47.706
She needs a babysitter,
she can pay 20 dollars an hour

53:47.783 --> 53:49.816
like everybody else.
One of ours is missing.

53:49.818 --> 53:53.211
Forget the motorcade
and help us find her, please!

53:54.232 --> 53:56.047
- Yeah, they're staring,
but they're not annoyed.

53:56.067 --> 53:58.049
They're happy somebody's
screaming about it, and so am I.

53:58.069 --> 53:59.884
- Halothane supplier,
what do you got? Anything?

53:59.904 --> 54:03.480
- Look, just to be clear,
to find Nicole, no lanes, okay?

54:03.632 --> 54:05.632
Anything goes.
- I got you. What do you got?

54:05.651 --> 54:07.634
Come on.
- You got clamps, anesthesia,

54:07.653 --> 54:11.472
CT scanner, surgical table,
dialysis machine, stirrups.

54:11.474 --> 54:13.140
All sent to the shipping
address.

54:13.158 --> 54:16.234
- Why hasn't the alert gone out?
- I asked them to wait.

54:16.254 --> 54:18.161
- Well, what for?
- So I could be the one

54:18.238 --> 54:20.739
to tell my kids that their
mother is missing.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.408
- Jason, Jason. Please tell them
that we're going to do

54:23.486 --> 54:26.411
everything that we possibly can.
And once that alert is issued,

54:26.430 --> 54:28.264
I will see to it
that it's reissued

54:28.415 --> 54:30.915
with regular updates, okay?
- Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:30.993 --> 54:31.992
Say that again.

54:32.495 --> 54:34.678
- Tell Sid and Keith--
- No, no, regular updates.

54:34.755 --> 54:37.164
- What about it?
- Yeah. Certain medical devices

54:37.166 --> 54:39.108
have regular software
updates remotely.

54:39.335 --> 54:41.168
- If one of the machines that
she has gets those updates,

54:41.261 --> 54:42.927
we'll be able to track her
through her IP address.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.072
Let's go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

54:51.013 --> 54:53.289
Hey, Sid. Listen,
I need to talk to you

54:53.440 --> 54:55.332
and your brother right now.

54:56.777 --> 54:58.018
(door opens)

54:58.037 --> 55:00.020
- Hey, Dad wants to talk to us.

55:00.039 --> 55:01.872
- Okay. Knocking would be good.

55:01.948 --> 55:03.782
- Dear diary, when will
the fuzz on my lip

55:03.859 --> 55:04.875
turn into a real moustache?

55:05.027 --> 55:06.635
I never saw you
as a journal keeper.

55:07.046 --> 55:08.862
- We... learned
to do it in therapy.

55:08.881 --> 55:10.380
It's part of
the healing process.

55:10.533 --> 55:12.215
- Oh. Sorry.

55:12.368 --> 55:13.367
<i> Dad, you still there?</i>

55:13.552 --> 55:15.311
- Yeah, hey, uh, I gotta
tell you both something.

55:15.462 --> 55:17.796
It's important.
- Dad, if this is about finding

55:17.873 --> 55:19.982
the person that took me,
I've been reading about
what happens next--

55:20.059 --> 55:21.650
- No, no, Keith...
<i> - No, I know.</i>

55:21.802 --> 55:24.320
I'll have to identify her,
testify against her.

55:24.355 --> 55:26.137
When I escaped, I thought
I'd never have to be

55:26.157 --> 55:27.472
in the same room
as her again, but--

55:27.550 --> 55:29.491
- Hey, listen.
It's not about that,

55:29.568 --> 55:31.068
it's about Mom.
Something happened to her.

55:31.220 --> 55:33.996
- What? What happened to her?

55:34.498 --> 55:36.081
- She was taken.

55:38.336 --> 55:40.085
(alarm blaring)

55:48.087 --> 55:50.587
- We need to focus
on getting out.

55:50.739 --> 55:53.998
- No, we can't escape her.
- Of course we can.

55:54.076 --> 55:55.926
You know, she took my son once.

55:56.078 --> 55:58.762
She held him, just like you.

55:58.839 --> 56:00.581
And he escaped.

56:00.599 --> 56:02.265
You can do it too.

56:02.418 --> 56:05.069
You have the same fight in you,
I can tell.

56:05.529 --> 56:06.603
Now, um...

56:07.606 --> 56:10.424
You see that IV
in your arm right there?

56:10.426 --> 56:12.684
I'm gonna need you
to take it out.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.185
- What if she comes back?

56:14.263 --> 56:15.262
Maybe we should just wait
for the police.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.447
- I don't think
we have time to wait.

56:18.267 --> 56:20.358
Come on, Max, you can do this.

56:21.270 --> 56:25.606
Grab the plastic tube
right there and pull.

56:25.608 --> 56:30.135
Now, uh, give the tube
a firm yank.

56:30.629 --> 56:32.054
(clattering)

56:32.131 --> 56:34.706
That's okay.
That's what we want.

56:35.208 --> 56:37.709
You see that surgical table
right there?

56:37.728 --> 56:41.972
It has tools that you can use
to free yourself, Max.

56:42.048 --> 56:44.791
How's your aim?
Ever play cornhole?

56:44.793 --> 56:46.050
- With the beanbags?
- Yeah.

56:46.145 --> 56:48.219
- Yeah.
- Instead of a beanbag,

56:48.297 --> 56:49.554
you have an IV bag.

56:49.573 --> 56:53.909
Which you're gonna throw
onto that surgical table,

56:54.060 --> 56:55.969
and then you're gonna
take the tube,

56:55.971 --> 56:57.654
and then reel it over to you.

56:57.806 --> 56:59.581
Take your time.

56:59.733 --> 57:03.067
Yeah. Oh, that's perfect.

57:03.087 --> 57:04.569
That's great. Just, uh...

57:04.647 --> 57:07.756
Come on, reel it in.
Reel it in, yeah.

57:07.908 --> 57:09.174
(clanging)

57:10.819 --> 57:14.012
Can you reach the syringe?

57:14.432 --> 57:15.514
There.

57:16.325 --> 57:17.307
Good.

57:18.827 --> 57:21.145
Now, here's what
I need you to do.

57:37.196 --> 57:40.497
- Dialysis machines,
they get software updates.

57:42.367 --> 57:43.959
- This is good, but to track it,

57:44.110 --> 57:45.368
we need to know
who the manufacturer is.

57:45.537 --> 57:47.963
- CMT incorporated, and we
already pulled the warrant.

57:48.114 --> 57:49.447
- It's a map
of every CMT customer

57:49.467 --> 57:51.616
who has a dialysis machine
in the greater metro area.

57:51.694 --> 57:53.802
- Those are IP addresses
that CMT provided.

57:53.954 --> 57:56.213
- How many addresses is this?
- 145.

57:56.365 --> 57:58.381
- That's too many addresses,
we don't have time.

57:58.458 --> 57:59.866
- We got a hit on the alert.

57:59.868 --> 58:02.144
Colt's car was spotted
in the vicinity of Alden Park.

58:02.221 --> 58:06.148
- Oh, yeah, that area,
I count... ten.

58:06.299 --> 58:08.317
- Ten? Ten, we can do.
Ten's good.

58:08.393 --> 58:10.152
- And to paraphrase
our fearless leader,

58:10.303 --> 58:12.879
let's bring our baby back.
- But I want to come with you!

58:12.898 --> 58:14.138
- Are you field trained?

58:14.158 --> 58:15.807
- Captain Batista
gave me a chance,

58:15.826 --> 58:17.551
trusted me when nobody else did.

58:17.569 --> 58:18.977
I shot a gun once!

58:18.996 --> 58:21.054
- Fine, let's go. Ride with me.

58:21.073 --> 58:22.498
(suspenseful music)

58:24.001 --> 58:26.210
(inaudible conversations)

58:40.166 --> 58:44.002
- I want you to push
the needle halfway in, okay?

58:44.079 --> 58:46.671
Not all the way. And then,
bend the tip

58:46.749 --> 58:50.083
90 degrees counterclockwise.

58:50.176 --> 58:51.918
You're gonna feel
a little resistance.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.270
- I don't think it's working.

58:54.256 --> 58:55.864
- Come on,
just keep trying, Max.

58:56.016 --> 58:58.425
You got this, okay?
You can do this.

58:59.094 --> 59:01.278
- It worked.
- Get your straps.

59:01.430 --> 59:04.447
There you go.
Now the straps on your legs.

59:04.524 --> 59:05.707
You're amazing.

59:05.784 --> 59:10.287
Okay, now grab the scalpel
and cut my straps.

59:10.363 --> 59:13.048
Come on. Come on, come on.

59:13.199 --> 59:16.943
- She's coming.
- Wait. Stop, wait.

59:16.962 --> 59:19.054
(footsteps approaching)

59:22.876 --> 59:24.601
(door creaking)

59:26.955 --> 59:28.313
Okay, go, go.

59:28.974 --> 59:32.192
(panting)
Oh...

59:33.553 --> 59:35.028
Come on.

59:39.059 --> 59:42.244
Hey. We're gonna get you
out of here.

59:42.729 --> 59:44.162
Come on.

59:44.582 --> 59:45.730
Now...

59:46.584 --> 59:49.084
Once you're out,
you're gonna run.

59:49.235 --> 59:51.903
Go to a neighbour's house,
wherever you think

59:51.980 --> 59:54.631
that it's safe, and then...
then call 911.

59:54.666 --> 59:55.757
- You're not coming with me?

59:56.318 --> 59:58.910
- There's another boy in here
that needs my help.

59:58.987 --> 1:00:01.430
- Noah. Yeah, I saw him.

1:00:01.581 --> 1:00:03.414
There's something wrong
with him.

1:00:03.492 --> 1:00:04.600
- I know, I'm gonna get him,

1:00:04.676 --> 1:00:06.676
and then we'll be right
behind you, okay?

1:00:06.829 --> 1:00:08.920
You have to go. Come on.

1:00:08.997 --> 1:00:12.090
Careful, careful. Shh.

1:00:12.167 --> 1:00:14.484
(panting)

1:00:22.861 --> 1:00:24.361
Noah.

1:00:24.437 --> 1:00:27.331
I'm a police officer, Noah.
I'm here to help.

1:00:28.533 --> 1:00:30.216
Noah, can you stand?

1:00:30.218 --> 1:00:32.252
Noah? Can you talk?

1:00:32.946 --> 1:00:34.338
Oh, my God.

1:00:41.287 --> 1:00:45.390
- It's rude to enter
someone's room uninvited.

1:00:52.966 --> 1:00:55.542
- She's not in trouble,
she was taken.

1:00:55.544 --> 1:00:56.652
Yeah, this was such a bad idea.

1:00:56.803 --> 1:00:59.396
- Where's Sidney?
- In her room, terrified.

1:00:59.472 --> 1:01:00.972
Waiting by the phone
for an update.

1:01:00.991 --> 1:01:02.716
- You gotta calm down, okay?

1:01:02.718 --> 1:01:05.218
Nikki's gonna be alright.
- You don't know that.

1:01:05.237 --> 1:01:07.329
Whatever happens to her
is gonna be my fault.

1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:08.889
I never should've said anything.

1:01:08.891 --> 1:01:10.832
- You couldn't have known
this was going to happen.

1:01:10.984 --> 1:01:11.908
What you did was brave.

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:12.909
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:01:13.003 --> 1:01:14.686
- 'Cause from where
I'm standing,

1:01:14.688 --> 1:01:16.320
it looks pretty selfish.
- You tried to stop a woman

1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:18.990
from killing more kids.
How is that selfish?

1:01:19.659 --> 1:01:23.753
- This was about revenge.
- No. This is about justice.

1:01:24.256 --> 1:01:26.239
Jason and Nikki
are gonna stop her.

1:01:26.258 --> 1:01:28.517
They're gonna be heros.
You're gonna be a hero,

1:01:28.593 --> 1:01:30.427
and that woman is gonna get
what she deserves.

1:01:30.579 --> 1:01:33.596
- Maybe. Or maybe someone
I care about

1:01:33.749 --> 1:01:35.273
is gonna end up dead.

1:01:36.435 --> 1:01:38.268
- Another dead end,
what do you got?

1:01:38.344 --> 1:01:40.178
- I just got off the phone
with Joe Maxwell.

1:01:40.255 --> 1:01:41.530
Captain Batista
helped him escape.

1:01:41.606 --> 1:01:43.699
He got to a convenience store,
he called 911.

1:01:43.926 --> 1:01:45.108
- Wait, where's Nikki?

1:01:45.185 --> 1:01:48.453
- He said she stayed behind
to help save Noah.

1:01:52.525 --> 1:01:53.524
(phone ringing)

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:55.377
- I'm on my way, Mike,
almost there.

1:01:55.528 --> 1:01:56.937
- We're rerouting
all the vehicles to you.

1:01:56.939 --> 1:01:58.046
Ten minutes max.

1:01:58.290 --> 1:02:00.290
<i> - You said that when it comes</i>
<i> to finding Nikki,</i>

1:02:00.442 --> 1:02:01.975
<i> anything goes.</i>
<i> Did you mean it?</i>

1:02:01.977 --> 1:02:03.534
- Yeah, I did. I do.

1:02:03.612 --> 1:02:05.295
- Then I'm not waiting
for backup.

1:02:05.371 --> 1:02:07.264
- Good. I can't lose her, Jay.

1:02:09.952 --> 1:02:13.186
- My sweet, brave boy.

1:02:13.972 --> 1:02:15.956
We're almost ready.

1:02:16.016 --> 1:02:18.216
(clattering)
- Beth. He's dead.

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:20.360
You can't bring him back.

1:02:23.131 --> 1:02:25.449
- I think we'd better
settle you down.

1:02:26.577 --> 1:02:29.161
(Nikki grunting)

1:02:30.489 --> 1:02:32.372
(muffled speech)

1:02:36.161 --> 1:02:38.478
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, your son.

1:02:38.497 --> 1:02:41.481
Before you put me under,
you should...

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:44.000
you should know something
about your son.

1:02:44.152 --> 1:02:45.485
Come here.

1:02:45.929 --> 1:02:49.656
It's clear, uh... he doesn't get
his looks from you.

1:02:49.658 --> 1:02:51.082
(laughing)

1:02:51.159 --> 1:02:52.100
(she closes the gas tank)

1:02:52.436 --> 1:02:55.662
- On second thought, maybe
we don't need anesthesia.

1:02:55.664 --> 1:02:58.398
(suspenseful music)

1:03:41.059 --> 1:03:42.317
(gasping)

1:03:44.470 --> 1:03:46.729
(screaming)

1:03:47.399 --> 1:03:49.974
- Hey, hey, hey! Hands, hands.

1:03:50.052 --> 1:03:51.827
Let me see your hands right now.

1:03:51.903 --> 1:03:53.477
- Noah will die
without this transplant.

1:03:53.497 --> 1:03:55.646
- Put down the knife.
No one has to die.

1:03:55.724 --> 1:03:57.165
- Jay, Noah. Noah.

1:03:58.577 --> 1:04:00.151
- No, don't you dare.

1:04:00.245 --> 1:04:03.063
No. Don't. Don't, don't!
Don't go near him.

1:04:03.081 --> 1:04:05.340
Don't go near my son!

1:04:05.417 --> 1:04:07.092
(grunts)

1:04:09.162 --> 1:04:11.421
- You're okay. You alright?

1:04:11.497 --> 1:04:14.182
- Yeah, I'll be better
once I get out of here. Ow.

1:04:14.334 --> 1:04:15.851
- Put some pressure there.
- Yeah.

1:04:16.336 --> 1:04:19.354
- It's okay, honey.
I won't let them hurt you.

1:04:19.505 --> 1:04:21.022
I won't let anyone hurt you.

1:04:21.099 --> 1:04:22.840
- You're not gonna let
anybody hurt him?

1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:24.767
What about my son?
What about my son?

1:04:24.844 --> 1:04:25.935
- Jay.

1:04:26.088 --> 1:04:27.604
- Down on the floor right now,
face down.

1:04:27.756 --> 1:04:28.771
- Please.

1:04:28.848 --> 1:04:30.106
- Get down on the floor
right now.

1:04:30.183 --> 1:04:31.774
Get down on the floor
right now.

1:04:31.927 --> 1:04:32.775
- Please don't.
- Please don't?

1:04:32.928 --> 1:04:34.444
I thought about what I'd do

1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:36.613
in this moment for the last
six years of my life.

1:04:36.689 --> 1:04:38.522
(Nikki): Jay!
- Do you understand? Six years.

1:04:38.542 --> 1:04:40.433
- You don't want to do this.
- Six years,

1:04:40.526 --> 1:04:42.268
there's been a bullet in this
gun with your name on it.

1:04:42.287 --> 1:04:44.546
And that's what you deserve.
- I know how you feel, okay?

1:04:44.697 --> 1:04:47.031
I feel it too, but you...
you can't do this.

1:04:47.125 --> 1:04:49.609
- You understand me?
That's what you deserve.

1:04:49.611 --> 1:04:53.138
- Jay, please. You don't want
to do this, baby.

1:04:54.207 --> 1:04:56.540
(breathing heavily)
Think of Sidney.

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:58.226
- Six years.

1:05:00.972 --> 1:05:03.398
(sighing)
- Please, Jay.

1:05:09.297 --> 1:05:12.056
- My family deserves more.
- Thank you. Oh, God.

1:05:12.108 --> 1:05:14.558
- Elizabeth Coulter,
you're under arrest

1:05:14.636 --> 1:05:18.321
for attempted murder,
wrongful imprisonment,

1:05:18.398 --> 1:05:20.898
and the kidnapping of my son,
Keith Grant.

1:05:20.976 --> 1:05:22.334
(handcuffs clicking)

1:05:25.163 --> 1:05:26.980
She can't see you.

1:05:27.573 --> 1:05:30.650
I know that this is hard, but
if you can positively ID her,

1:05:30.652 --> 1:05:32.076
that is critical evidence

1:05:32.170 --> 1:05:34.170
that can be used
against her at trial.

1:05:35.298 --> 1:05:37.265
- Trial? Won't I have
to testify against her?

1:05:37.417 --> 1:05:38.416
She'll see me then.

1:05:38.493 --> 1:05:40.101
- She will not touch you
ever again.

1:05:40.178 --> 1:05:41.561
I promise, okay?

1:05:43.682 --> 1:05:44.606
- How's Mom?

1:05:45.333 --> 1:05:48.276
- She's alright. She lost
a little bit of blood,

1:05:48.428 --> 1:05:49.945
so she's a little lightheaded.

1:05:50.021 --> 1:05:51.337
It's normal, right?

1:05:51.339 --> 1:05:54.691
15 stitches, but to catch
your kidnapper,

1:05:54.693 --> 1:05:57.510
I promise you she would say
that it is worth it.

1:05:57.529 --> 1:06:00.497
Okay? The question is,
did we catch her?

1:06:03.852 --> 1:06:06.544
- Number two.
- Number two.

1:06:07.780 --> 1:06:10.090
Number two, step forward.

1:06:12.544 --> 1:06:13.551
Yeah?

1:06:14.471 --> 1:06:16.012
- Yeah, that's her.

1:06:17.975 --> 1:06:20.058
- I know who you are.

1:06:22.128 --> 1:06:23.794
You're the one who got away.

1:06:24.431 --> 1:06:26.039
- Come on, don't worry about it.

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:30.134
- She's right.
Keith is the one who got away.

1:06:30.212 --> 1:06:33.304
- And Mom. Don't forget Mom.
- Yeah, don't forget Mom.

1:06:33.381 --> 1:06:36.382
- Yes, Mom and Keith
are the ones who got away.

1:06:36.384 --> 1:06:39.719
And while we mourn the loss
of the ones who didn't...

1:06:39.738 --> 1:06:41.054
- To the ones who didn't.

1:06:41.556 --> 1:06:45.575
- ...but we celebrate the
victory of the ones who did.

1:06:45.651 --> 1:06:47.485
Look, I don't want
to sound corny,

1:06:47.487 --> 1:06:52.340
but we can also raise a glass
to justice being served,

1:06:52.417 --> 1:06:54.658
and to the bad guy,
or in this case,

1:06:54.736 --> 1:06:57.846
bad girl being caught, and this
story ending happily ever after.

1:06:57.922 --> 1:06:59.681
- Aww.
- That didn't sound corny.

1:06:59.908 --> 1:07:01.665
That was a whole can of corn.

1:07:01.685 --> 1:07:04.519
And I loved it. I loved it.
- Thanks.

1:07:04.670 --> 1:07:06.521
- It was pretty good.
Pretty good, actually.

1:07:06.598 --> 1:07:08.398
- Come on.
(laughing)

1:07:11.361 --> 1:07:12.527
(chuckling)

1:07:14.531 --> 1:07:16.197
- I'm glad Oliver is here.

1:07:16.925 --> 1:07:18.925
He's become a good friend,
hasn't he?

1:07:18.943 --> 1:07:22.945
- He has. I... I definitely
couldn't have gotten

1:07:23.098 --> 1:07:25.206
through this without him.
(Kemi chanting indistinctly)

1:07:25.784 --> 1:07:28.268
- You should probably go save
him from Kemi, though.

1:07:28.286 --> 1:07:29.919
Once she starts
rubbing those eggs,

1:07:30.105 --> 1:07:32.196
there's no telling
where things may end. Go.

1:07:32.215 --> 1:07:34.607
(Kemi chanting in Hausa)

1:07:34.626 --> 1:07:36.760
(inaudible)

1:07:40.448 --> 1:07:41.556
- I'm not nuts.

1:07:42.875 --> 1:07:43.725
(chuckling)

1:07:43.876 --> 1:07:45.451
Or psychic, but dumb and dumber,

1:07:45.453 --> 1:07:47.620
I can sense in my sleep, so...

1:07:47.622 --> 1:07:48.955
- No, no, no, keep going.

1:07:48.973 --> 1:07:50.790
Hey, I believe you.
He's the heathen.

1:07:50.792 --> 1:07:52.125
- Go, both of you,

1:07:52.218 --> 1:07:54.477
before I curse you to speak
in tongues or something.

1:07:54.571 --> 1:07:55.886
- You can do that?

1:07:55.906 --> 1:07:57.647
She can do that?
- Out!

1:07:57.799 --> 1:07:59.074
(chuckling)

1:08:01.894 --> 1:08:04.037
(tense music)

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:08.491
- How weird is this?

1:08:08.901 --> 1:08:12.754
When she was rubbing the egg,
I actually felt something.

1:08:13.498 --> 1:08:16.174
- Like what? Like...

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:19.127
Like maybe it's not over?

1:08:20.338 --> 1:08:23.932
- More like she could see
what I was thinking.

1:08:24.993 --> 1:08:26.768
- You should be thinking
it's not over.

1:08:26.845 --> 1:08:30.680
I'm gonna have to testify
against her in open court.

1:08:30.832 --> 1:08:32.273
- I know you're scared of that.

1:08:32.425 --> 1:08:34.592
- You're the only one
who knows why.

1:08:35.112 --> 1:08:39.689
- Which is why I'll be with you
every step of the way.

1:08:39.841 --> 1:08:41.841
You hear me? Every step.

1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:44.285
Bro, this is a great day.

1:08:44.437 --> 1:08:46.346
You should be flying high
right now.

1:08:46.348 --> 1:08:50.199
Look around. You've got
everything you could ever want.

1:08:50.352 --> 1:08:53.110
This house, this family.

1:08:53.630 --> 1:08:57.448
A super hot sister.
- You did not just say that.

1:08:57.525 --> 1:08:59.092
(laughing)

1:09:00.286 --> 1:09:04.139
- I wish I was
in your shoes, man.

1:09:06.034 --> 1:09:08.017
You're set for life.

1:09:14.967 --> 1:09:16.192
(car door closes)

1:09:17.562 --> 1:09:19.154
(engine starts)

1:09:24.736 --> 1:09:26.719
(car approaching)

1:09:26.721 --> 1:09:28.312
(tires screeching)

1:09:28.331 --> 1:09:29.497
(grunts)

1:09:31.893 --> 1:09:33.409
- I warned you
not to tell anyone.

1:09:33.486 --> 1:09:35.819
I told you what would happen
if you did!

1:09:36.339 --> 1:09:40.324
- Hey, you hear that?
- Yeah. Where's Keith?

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:43.261
- You will never
get away from me.

1:09:45.498 --> 1:09:47.015
(grunting)

1:09:47.425 --> 1:09:48.391
- Keith?

1:09:49.594 --> 1:09:51.186
(handle clicking)

1:09:51.337 --> 1:09:52.228
- Dad!

1:09:52.931 --> 1:09:54.931
- Hey!
- Dad! Dad!

1:09:55.083 --> 1:09:57.233
- Hey! Hey!
- Dad! Dad!

1:09:57.843 --> 1:09:58.601
Dad!

1:09:58.753 --> 1:10:02.405
(screaming)
- Keith! Baby!

1:10:06.352 --> 1:10:06.993
Yes, yes. Black mini SUV,
Pennsylvania plates.

1:10:08.430 --> 1:10:12.265
- Hey. First three digits,
Whiskey, Delta, Seven.

1:10:12.267 --> 1:10:14.858
That's all I got.
- You got that? Yes.

1:10:15.403 --> 1:10:20.773
Good, good. I need the alert
to go out ASAP. Thanks, Sam.

1:10:20.866 --> 1:10:22.792
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll let you know.

1:10:22.944 --> 1:10:24.702
(breathing heavily)

1:10:24.779 --> 1:10:27.222
I can't do this again, Jay.
I won't make it.

1:10:27.298 --> 1:10:29.224
- You're not gonna have
to do anything again.

1:10:29.300 --> 1:10:30.558
I'm here, you're not alone.

1:10:30.635 --> 1:10:32.060
We're in this together,
we're gonna find him.

1:10:32.211 --> 1:10:33.953
I promise, we're gonna find him.

1:10:33.955 --> 1:10:35.212
- We hit every house
on the block.

1:10:35.232 --> 1:10:36.639
Nobody saw anything.

1:10:36.716 --> 1:10:37.807
- Hey, I'm pulling as much

1:10:37.959 --> 1:10:39.067
security cam footage as I can.

1:10:39.218 --> 1:10:41.627
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa...
- What do you got?

1:10:41.629 --> 1:10:43.312
- What is it?
- I got into Keith's phone,

1:10:43.465 --> 1:10:47.224
and there are texts on
a messaging app. I think...

1:10:47.244 --> 1:10:49.986
I think whoever took him
had been contacting him.

1:10:50.138 --> 1:10:53.581
- "You run away from me,
tell anyone about me,
I'll kill you."

1:10:53.658 --> 1:10:55.065
- And from the metadata,

1:10:55.143 --> 1:10:57.143
the harassment started
over a month ago.

1:10:57.145 --> 1:10:58.569
- Why didn't Keith say anything?

1:10:58.663 --> 1:11:00.162
- Sidney, did you know
anything about this?

1:11:00.315 --> 1:11:02.815
- No, I swear.
- How could I have not noticed?

1:11:02.834 --> 1:11:06.076
- Hey, hey, hey. Do not beat
yourself up about this, okay?

1:11:06.096 --> 1:11:08.170
Hey, you were with him
every step of the way,

1:11:08.323 --> 1:11:10.006
and he felt that, okay?
He was probably just

1:11:10.082 --> 1:11:11.841
too scared to say anything.
- Wait a minute.

1:11:11.993 --> 1:11:13.917
Lightning does not
strike twice.

1:11:13.937 --> 1:11:15.678
Keith gets picked up again,

1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:18.106
right on the same day
that we get Elizabeth Coulter?

1:11:18.333 --> 1:11:19.665
Cannot be a coincidence.

1:11:19.667 --> 1:11:21.501
- You think she has something
to do with this.

1:11:21.519 --> 1:11:23.444
- Look at these messages,
she's making good on her threat.

1:11:23.521 --> 1:11:26.114
- Alright. There's only one way
to find out, come on.

1:11:26.190 --> 1:11:28.116
(tense music)

1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:55.459
- Where is he?

1:11:55.537 --> 1:11:56.811
- I could ask you
the same thing.

1:11:56.888 --> 1:11:59.555
- Noah's safe.
- He's very sick.

1:11:59.632 --> 1:12:02.725
He requires a clean
and sterile environment.

1:12:02.877 --> 1:12:04.802
He's susceptible to infection.
- Noah is fine.

1:12:04.896 --> 1:12:09.215
You can see him as soon as you
can tell us where our son is.

1:12:09.233 --> 1:12:10.808
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:12:10.885 --> 1:12:12.810
- You have an accomplice?
Did you pay somebody?

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:15.237
- To do what?
- You knew that Keith

1:12:15.390 --> 1:12:17.056
was going to testify
against you, so you handled it.

1:12:17.075 --> 1:12:20.409
- We know that you
have been threatening him
ever since he escaped.

1:12:20.562 --> 1:12:23.296
- I don't know anyone
named Keith.

1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:27.400
- That's Keith.

1:12:27.919 --> 1:12:30.327
That's the boy that you took.

1:12:31.181 --> 1:12:33.589
- I have never seen that boy
before in my life.

1:12:33.666 --> 1:12:36.851
Okay, I answered your questions.
Can I see my son now, please?

1:12:36.928 --> 1:12:39.336
- No, no. No, you can't.

1:12:39.430 --> 1:12:41.247
<i> - You told me</i>
<i> I could see my son!</i>

1:12:41.265 --> 1:12:42.673
- She is lying, okay?

1:12:42.692 --> 1:12:44.750
If she admits to taking Keith,

1:12:44.752 --> 1:12:46.194
then that could be used
against her at trial.

1:12:46.345 --> 1:12:48.029
- Look, that is way
too calculated for somebody

1:12:48.106 --> 1:12:49.589
who thinks
her dead son is alive.

1:12:49.682 --> 1:12:51.924
- Whoa. She's lying, or Keith's
lying. What are you saying?

1:12:52.017 --> 1:12:54.017
- What I'm saying is there's
a few inconsistencies.

1:12:54.095 --> 1:12:57.688
Keith doesn't exactly fit the
profile of Beth's usual victims.

1:12:57.765 --> 1:12:59.040
Okay, he wasn't homeless...

1:12:59.233 --> 1:13:01.767
- He's walking around late
at night, he's soaking wet!

1:13:01.769 --> 1:13:04.027
She sees a target of opportunity
and she takes it!

1:13:04.047 --> 1:13:05.788
- Okay, but Keith was ransomed.

1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:07.790
- So she realized
she made a mistake!

1:13:07.942 --> 1:13:09.108
- What, six years
after the fact?

1:13:09.201 --> 1:13:11.702
That doesn't make sense.
- Easy. What about Max?

1:13:11.779 --> 1:13:13.446
Okay, the cabin in the woods.

1:13:13.464 --> 1:13:17.207
Everything that Keith
has said has panned out
exactly as he said.

1:13:17.301 --> 1:13:19.376
- I know, okay? I just...

1:13:19.396 --> 1:13:21.396
Look, the security footage
in your neighborhood

1:13:21.547 --> 1:13:23.989
gave us nothing.
The alert didn't either.

1:13:23.991 --> 1:13:25.716
And there are literally
hundreds of black SUVs

1:13:25.793 --> 1:13:27.551
with plates that start
with those three digits.

1:13:27.629 --> 1:13:29.052
(phone ringing)
Okay, we have no leads.

1:13:29.130 --> 1:13:30.146
So if we want Keith back safely,

1:13:30.556 --> 1:13:33.056
we have to consider other
angles. That's all I'm saying.

1:13:33.134 --> 1:13:34.892
- Hold on, it's Sidney.
Hey, baby.

1:13:34.969 --> 1:13:38.471
- I think I may have
found something that can
help with Keith.

1:13:38.473 --> 1:13:40.248
- Hold on, let me put you
on speaker.

1:13:40.917 --> 1:13:42.308
<i> - So I went through his room,</i>

1:13:42.326 --> 1:13:44.310
<i> and I know that maybe</i>
<i> I shouldn't have, but...</i>

1:13:44.312 --> 1:13:47.755
<i>he keeps a journal for therapy,</i>
<i> and he mentions the woman.</i>

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:50.073
The one sending threatening
messages to him,

1:13:50.093 --> 1:13:51.909
and she's stalking him too,
and apparently,

1:13:51.986 --> 1:13:53.152
she came to the house once.

1:13:53.154 --> 1:13:54.654
- Did he write down her name?

1:13:54.656 --> 1:13:55.913
Any kind of ID?

1:13:55.932 --> 1:13:58.007
<i> - No, he just calls her E.H.</i>

1:13:58.159 --> 1:13:59.659
- I wonder how many black SUVs

1:13:59.661 --> 1:14:01.827
with the plates
that start with W-D-7

1:14:01.846 --> 1:14:03.604
are registered
in those initials.

1:14:04.724 --> 1:14:06.274
- Her name is Evelyn Hadley,

1:14:06.350 --> 1:14:07.942
and she has a criminal record
a mile long.

1:14:08.093 --> 1:14:10.519
Petty theft. Robbery.
Possession. Assault.

1:14:10.596 --> 1:14:12.188
- What does she want
with our son?

1:14:12.264 --> 1:14:15.616
- Well, her car is registered
to 47 Lamont Ave,

1:14:15.768 --> 1:14:16.934
so I say we go ask her.

1:14:17.011 --> 1:14:18.494
(intense music)

1:14:43.371 --> 1:14:45.221
- You're okay, baby.
Hey, you're okay.

1:14:45.373 --> 1:14:47.130
- You have to go.
You have to go, she could--

1:14:47.150 --> 1:14:48.649
- Where is she?
Hey, don't worry.

1:14:48.726 --> 1:14:49.892
- I mean it! Please, just go!

1:14:50.044 --> 1:14:51.319
- What are you doing
in my house?

1:14:51.395 --> 1:14:53.896
- Hey! Don't move, hands up.
- Get away from my son.

1:14:54.048 --> 1:14:54.989
- Please don't make
this difficult.

1:14:55.066 --> 1:14:57.550
- Your son?
(scoffing)

1:14:57.552 --> 1:14:58.901
- Tell them, Lucas.

1:14:59.570 --> 1:15:02.413
Tell these nice people
you've been lying to them
the whole time.

1:15:03.407 --> 1:15:05.291
(dramatic music)

1:15:09.839 --> 1:15:10.988
Can't do it, can you?

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:15.343
Even now, you can't man up
and tell the truth.

1:15:15.344 --> 1:15:16.010
- Mom, just let them go.

1:15:16.161 --> 1:15:17.403
- I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

1:15:17.847 --> 1:15:20.740
Did you just call her "Mom"?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:15:20.758 --> 1:15:23.242
Look, I swear, I didn't want
to hurt you guys.

1:15:23.244 --> 1:15:25.168
She saw you on the news
last year.

1:15:25.246 --> 1:15:26.929
That program about
missing kids.

1:15:27.081 --> 1:15:29.248
Keith was one of them,
and she saw how much

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:30.858
I looked like him and
how desperate you guys were.

1:15:31.085 --> 1:15:33.027
She thought maybe she could
make some money.

1:15:33.178 --> 1:15:36.197
I didn't want to, I promise. I
tried to tell her that and she--

1:15:36.274 --> 1:15:37.773
- Don't act like such a victim.

1:15:37.867 --> 1:15:39.308
It's not like I put
a gun to your head.

1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:41.927
- I studied you for her,
at first, but the more I read,

1:15:41.946 --> 1:15:43.612
the more perfect
your family seemed.

1:15:43.765 --> 1:15:46.874
I started to imagine
what it would be like
to be a part of that.

1:15:46.951 --> 1:15:49.377
- You came into our house,
you lied to us.

1:15:49.453 --> 1:15:52.288
You lied to our daughter.
- Sidney was right, she knew.

1:15:52.364 --> 1:15:55.883
- I know I have no right to
ask for forgiveness, I just...

1:15:56.035 --> 1:15:58.469
I wanted what he had.

1:16:00.706 --> 1:16:02.181
A real home.

1:16:04.209 --> 1:16:07.210
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:16:07.230 --> 1:16:09.564
- Put the gun down!
- He's my son, okay!

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:11.548
Not yours! Mine!

1:16:11.626 --> 1:16:14.310
- Okay, uh, clearly,
we missed something.

1:16:14.386 --> 1:16:15.461
- What is she talking about?

1:16:15.479 --> 1:16:17.071
- His name is Lucas,
he's an imposter.

1:16:17.148 --> 1:16:18.314
- He's a pain
in everyone's backside,

1:16:18.466 --> 1:16:19.740
so unless you're planning
on locking him up,

1:16:19.892 --> 1:16:22.134
I'd ask that you leave my house.
- Hey, just relax, okay?

1:16:22.153 --> 1:16:23.744
Everybody put the gun down,
we can talk about it.

1:16:23.896 --> 1:16:25.154
- What you did,
you gave us hope.

1:16:25.248 --> 1:16:27.823
- I thought about that,
that it would make you happy.

1:16:27.975 --> 1:16:29.399
- No, no, no.
We wanted our son back.

1:16:29.477 --> 1:16:31.252
- And I want mine.
And now that I got him,

1:16:31.329 --> 1:16:32.402
I think we're done here.

1:16:32.422 --> 1:16:34.163
- You ransomed us, you sent him

1:16:34.315 --> 1:16:35.981
texts threatening him,

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.075
and now, we have reason
to believe

1:16:38.152 --> 1:16:39.652
that you've been
physically abusing him.

1:16:39.654 --> 1:16:41.262
- You're going to jail, Evelyn,
there's no way around that.

1:16:41.339 --> 1:16:43.580
- Don't do this. Don't make it
harder than it has to be.

1:16:43.658 --> 1:16:45.749
(scoffs)
- That's rich coming from you.

1:16:45.827 --> 1:16:46.842
None of this would be happening

1:16:46.919 --> 1:16:48.160
if you hadn't pretended
to be their son!

1:16:48.179 --> 1:16:50.329
- I know, it was my fault,
not theirs!

1:16:50.348 --> 1:16:52.164
They're good people!
They made me happy!

1:16:52.183 --> 1:16:54.591
- Don't make it sound like
they're good people,
and I'm the crazy one!

1:16:54.669 --> 1:16:56.444
- Mom, I am begging you!

1:16:56.446 --> 1:16:57.403
(gunshot)

1:17:08.516 --> 1:17:11.016
- On the ground, on the ground.
Hands behind your back.

1:17:11.018 --> 1:17:13.702
- EMTs! EMTs now, please!
Hey, baby.

1:17:13.855 --> 1:17:15.371
- Okay, look at me.

1:17:15.447 --> 1:17:16.631
- You need to focus.

1:17:16.782 --> 1:17:20.801
- Hey, hey. Stay with me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:17:20.878 --> 1:17:22.711
- Sorry for nothing, baby.

1:17:22.864 --> 1:17:23.971
(crying)

1:17:24.198 --> 1:17:26.140
- I got the pressure.
(indistinct chatter)

1:17:32.148 --> 1:17:34.357
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Hold on.

1:17:37.803 --> 1:17:39.570
(soft eerie music)

1:17:43.734 --> 1:17:46.035
(sirens blaring)

1:17:54.337 --> 1:17:56.837
- This can't be happening.
It doesn't make any sense.

1:17:56.914 --> 1:18:00.232
- Not to me. Max, the cabin...

1:18:00.234 --> 1:18:03.068
How could he have known?
- Yeah, about that.

1:18:03.203 --> 1:18:05.680
I just sent somebody to check
on Max to get a statement.

1:18:05.831 --> 1:18:08.331
He confirms there was another
boy with him at the cabin,

1:18:08.351 --> 1:18:10.309
but his name wasn't Keith.

1:18:10.853 --> 1:18:12.561
It was Oliver.

1:18:16.526 --> 1:18:21.237
- Everything that Lucas said
about what Beth did was true.

1:18:22.365 --> 1:18:25.157
Except she didn't do it to him.

1:18:27.745 --> 1:18:29.495
She did it to me.

1:18:32.433 --> 1:18:36.293
I was... a human blood bag.

1:18:37.863 --> 1:18:39.196
For two years.

1:18:39.290 --> 1:18:44.009
And so, when I saw a chance
to escape, I did.

1:18:44.962 --> 1:18:47.704
Except I left Max behind.

1:18:48.132 --> 1:18:50.558
<i>- Why didn't you go to the cops?</i>

1:18:50.634 --> 1:18:52.134
<i> - I don't know.</i>

1:18:52.211 --> 1:18:57.064
<i> I should've, but the guilt</i>
<i> was overwhelming.</i>

1:18:57.141 --> 1:19:00.642
<i> And the longer I waited,</i>

1:19:00.795 --> 1:19:03.629
<i> the harder it was for me</i>
<i> to come forward.</i>

1:19:03.647 --> 1:19:06.648
- But Lucas offered you
a way to make it right.

1:19:06.801 --> 1:19:08.242
- Yeah.

1:19:09.136 --> 1:19:10.803
I needed a second chance,

1:19:10.805 --> 1:19:14.915
and... he needed his case
closed so you'd stop digging.

1:19:14.992 --> 1:19:18.401
- But how did Lucas ID Beth
Coulter? He'd never seen her.

1:19:18.421 --> 1:19:20.479
- And I can never forget her.

1:19:20.906 --> 1:19:23.999
So I found a photo
of her online.

1:19:24.093 --> 1:19:27.577
- Okay, that's your story,
but what about Keith's?

1:19:27.597 --> 1:19:29.488
Okay, Lucas knew everything
that Keith would know.

1:19:29.490 --> 1:19:32.825
Nicole's blueberry pancakes,
Jason's good luck bracelet.

1:19:33.269 --> 1:19:36.437
- Those were all details
he'd found in interviews.

1:19:36.588 --> 1:19:40.090
He had newspaper articles
going back years.

1:19:40.167 --> 1:19:42.184
<i>(Kemi): What about the DNA test?</i>

1:19:42.336 --> 1:19:46.113
<i> - Nikki thought she was</i>
<i> testing Keith's baby hair,</i>

1:19:46.190 --> 1:19:49.658
<i> but Lucas had replaced it</i>
<i> with his own.</i>

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.529
<i> (Mike): What about</i>
<i> the scar on his arm?</i>

1:19:53.681 --> 1:19:55.539
(sizzling)

1:19:58.628 --> 1:20:00.202
(breathing heavily)

1:20:00.354 --> 1:20:03.172
<i> He actually burned himself</i>
<i> with boiling water?</i>

1:20:04.375 --> 1:20:05.758
- Yeah.

1:20:07.194 --> 1:20:09.545
He did anything he could...

1:20:09.621 --> 1:20:14.225
to escape the life he had.
You would too.

1:20:15.386 --> 1:20:18.103
Keith's life was a fantasy.

1:20:20.708 --> 1:20:23.526
At least he got to live it
for a few months.

1:20:26.531 --> 1:20:27.880
- We should've known.

1:20:27.898 --> 1:20:31.158
- Hope is a very
powerful thing, Nik.

1:20:32.219 --> 1:20:33.994
- We're police officers, Jay.

1:20:34.146 --> 1:20:36.722
I'm the head of
the Missing Persons Unit.

1:20:36.724 --> 1:20:37.998
- We're also parents.

1:20:38.150 --> 1:20:40.626
We're parents who wanted
our kid back.

1:20:41.745 --> 1:20:44.154
We saw what we wanted to see.

1:20:44.732 --> 1:20:46.465
- What do we do now?

1:20:48.736 --> 1:20:52.346
- I don't know. I guess
the only thing we can do.

1:20:52.423 --> 1:20:54.014
Grieve.

1:20:56.577 --> 1:20:59.061
(soft music)

1:21:03.192 --> 1:21:06.509
- They say that when
you lose someone you love,

1:21:06.529 --> 1:21:09.196
that you also lose
a piece of yourself.

1:21:09.273 --> 1:21:12.274
That our soul fractures.

1:21:12.351 --> 1:21:16.853
And when tragedy happens,
our soul flees from us.

1:21:16.931 --> 1:21:21.934
Hiding as a way to protect
itself from the pain.

1:21:21.936 --> 1:21:23.878
I call this soul loss.

1:21:23.987 --> 1:21:25.880
- They're dredging the lake.

1:21:26.457 --> 1:21:29.141
Whatever they may find,
at least you know what
happened that night.

1:21:29.143 --> 1:21:30.792
- And you know
it wasn't your fault.

1:21:30.945 --> 1:21:32.794
- Look at that...
a silver lining.

1:21:32.871 --> 1:21:38.041
- Pieces of our soul
get stuck dwelling in the past,
unable to move forward.

1:21:38.119 --> 1:21:39.727
But a fact about
our physical world

1:21:39.878 --> 1:21:44.139
is that matter can neither be
created or destroyed.

1:21:44.291 --> 1:21:46.792
- You know, you're not supposed
to drink alone.

1:21:47.294 --> 1:21:50.053
<i> (Kemi): This is the same</i>
<i> for our spiritual world.</i>

1:21:50.072 --> 1:21:55.200
<i> No matter what,</i>
<i> you cannot lose your soul.</i>

1:21:55.819 --> 1:21:57.328
(chuckling)

1:21:59.081 --> 1:22:01.582
- Thank you.
- For what?

1:22:01.733 --> 1:22:04.159
- Letting me stay
on the grieving couch.

1:22:05.329 --> 1:22:09.340
- Yeah, it's... it's like
déjà vu all over again.

1:22:10.909 --> 1:22:14.094
- I mean it. Thank you, Nik.
I didn't want to do this alone.

1:22:14.672 --> 1:22:16.555
- Yeah, neither did I.

1:22:34.099 --> 1:22:35.674
I love you.

1:22:35.934 --> 1:22:37.576
- I love you too.

1:22:44.794 --> 1:22:46.126
Thanks.

1:22:48.522 --> 1:22:49.463
- Thank you.

1:22:52.969 --> 1:22:56.528
<i> (Kemi): Grief is the act</i>
<i> of soul retrieval.</i>

1:22:57.289 --> 1:23:01.883
<i> And if we commit ourselves</i>
<i> to it, the soul will, in time,</i>

1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:05.145
<i> return to its intact state.</i>

1:23:07.316 --> 1:23:09.224
<i>And that's why we're here today.</i>

1:23:09.893 --> 1:23:12.469
To retrieve our collective soul.

1:23:13.472 --> 1:23:18.975
And to celebrate the life
of that beautiful boy

1:23:19.053 --> 1:23:21.161
that we all miss so much.

1:23:22.832 --> 1:23:28.168
Keith was a light
to all who knew him.

1:23:29.230 --> 1:23:34.324
And in death, his light
continues to shine.

1:23:34.401 --> 1:23:38.178
So, the journey of the last year
has not been easy.

1:23:38.255 --> 1:23:40.681
(chuckling)
Child, it has not been easy.

1:23:40.758 --> 1:23:43.759
But um, in the end,

1:23:43.911 --> 1:23:47.670
there was forgiveness
for those of us who needed

1:23:47.690 --> 1:23:49.097
to let down our burdens.

1:23:49.174 --> 1:23:53.676
Answers where there had
only been questions.

1:23:54.012 --> 1:23:57.773
And though they may not have
been the answers that we wanted,

1:23:57.849 --> 1:24:00.776
we are grateful all the same.

1:24:00.778 --> 1:24:03.537
With every end,

1:24:04.765 --> 1:24:06.582
we mark a new beginning.

1:24:09.528 --> 1:24:11.027
(laughing)

1:24:11.714 --> 1:24:14.106
- That was the moment I knew
we had a drummer on our hands.

1:24:14.124 --> 1:24:15.549
Edwina was never the same.

1:24:15.776 --> 1:24:19.111
- Edwina. I had to wear earplugs
in the house

1:24:19.113 --> 1:24:20.462
for six months straight
after that.

1:24:20.539 --> 1:24:23.799
- Yeah, his Nickelback phase
was always torture.

1:24:23.951 --> 1:24:25.225
(glass shattering)

1:24:26.395 --> 1:24:27.877
(laughing)

1:24:27.897 --> 1:24:29.063
<i> (Jay): You're a drummer!</i>

1:24:29.214 --> 1:24:30.806
<i> Finish the gig!?</i>
<i> Finish the gig!</i>

1:24:30.958 --> 1:24:33.216
<i> Yes! And the crowd</i>
<i> goes wild! Yes!</i>

1:24:33.235 --> 1:24:35.143
<i> Keith is the greatest</i>
<i> drummer in the world!</i>

1:24:35.296 --> 1:24:37.554
- That was amazing.

1:24:37.573 --> 1:24:38.964
And healing.

1:24:38.982 --> 1:24:41.149
- Yeah, whoever thought
our mental health

1:24:41.302 --> 1:24:42.801
would be almost
entirely dependents

1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:46.080
on our concierge Shaman who does
the occasional egg reading?

1:24:46.231 --> 1:24:47.397
- And lime bath.

1:24:47.416 --> 1:24:49.308
- And candle wax interpreter.

1:24:49.310 --> 1:24:53.145
- Okay, that is my cue to go.
You're welcome, friends.

1:24:53.163 --> 1:24:55.089
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

1:24:55.165 --> 1:24:57.149
Unless you're planning
to apparate.

1:24:57.151 --> 1:24:58.908
- I should probably go to.
It's been a minute,

1:24:58.928 --> 1:25:00.410
but I think I know
where my apartment is.

1:25:00.429 --> 1:25:04.414
- That was awesome. Ugh,
I'm so glad that we did that.

1:25:04.433 --> 1:25:06.325
(sighs)

1:25:07.269 --> 1:25:10.587
- Oh, um, I gotta handle
something real quick.

1:25:10.606 --> 1:25:12.922
I'll meet up with you guys
in a bit. Okay?

1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.683
- Alright.
- Thank you.

1:25:14.835 --> 1:25:16.276
- Okay, bye.

1:25:22.434 --> 1:25:23.492
(grunting)

1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:26.161
(knocking)

1:25:30.184 --> 1:25:33.293
- You forget something?
- Nope.

1:25:37.133 --> 1:25:39.282
- The hide-a-key?
- It's a housewarming gift

1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:40.634
for the man of the house.

1:25:40.711 --> 1:25:42.952
- You know you don't have
to do that, right?

1:25:43.030 --> 1:25:45.305
- I know. I figured
I should, though.

1:25:47.050 --> 1:25:48.884
- You know,
if you ever get lost,

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:51.703
you always got a place to stay.
The couch.

1:25:51.705 --> 1:25:53.605
- Got it. Thank you, brother.

1:25:54.633 --> 1:25:55.649
- My man.

1:25:55.800 --> 1:25:57.484
- Talk to you soon.
- Yeah.

1:25:57.561 --> 1:25:59.069
- Alright.

1:26:03.567 --> 1:26:05.325
(soft music)

1:26:29.501 --> 1:26:31.351
Subtitling: difuze
