00:10.710 --> 00:14.214
'...a bit. I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.214 --> 00:17.384
the show that brings you
genuine stories from history...'

00:17.384 --> 00:21.287
A beautiful child!
Yeah! Get your knob out!

00:21.287 --> 00:24.157
'...as told
by blind drunk comedians.'

00:24.157 --> 00:26.226
Ay, oh, no go.

00:26.226 --> 00:30.029
'It's like going to school with
a can of Special Brew.' (retches)

00:30.029 --> 00:31.598
(laughs)
(burps)

00:31.598 --> 00:34.534
'Learning about the past
is a lot more interesting

00:34.534 --> 00:38.304
when your teacher's shit-faced.'
Boring!

00:38.304 --> 00:40.407
Shit!

00:40.407 --> 00:43.009
(laughs)

00:45.011 --> 00:46.346
Oh, God!

00:56.790 --> 00:59.592
'We start tonight with
a story about King Henry VIII

00:59.592 --> 01:02.095
which, even though it happened
500 years ago,

01:02.095 --> 01:05.832
will be all too familiar to anyone
who's ever tried Internet dating.'

01:05.832 --> 01:07.200
'Here's Rob Beckett

01:07.200 --> 01:10.703
who, after knocking back three pints
of lager, eight whiskies,

01:10.703 --> 01:15.008
and six shots of Sambuca,
is settling down to tell the tale.'

01:15.008 --> 01:16.476
Shall I look at you or that?

01:20.547 --> 01:24.451
We all know King Henry VIII had
an absolute nightmare with women.

01:24.451 --> 01:30.356
But his decision to marry Anne
of Cleves was an absolute shocker.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.427
Right, picture the scene.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.429
It's 16th-century England

01:36.429 --> 01:39.632
and old Henry is on the lookout
for a new woman.

01:39.632 --> 01:43.069
So King Henry VIII is like,
"Cromwell, mate, I need some help."

01:43.069 --> 01:45.839
"I need a new wife.
I've not had the best luck."

01:45.839 --> 01:49.442
"Like, d'you know what I mean?
I've divorced one,

01:49.442 --> 01:53.480
I chopped one's head off,
and one died in childbirth."

01:53.480 --> 01:57.383
And Cromwell's like,
"Henry, it's not your fault."

01:57.383 --> 02:01.054
And Henry's like,
"Well, one definitely was."

02:01.054 --> 02:04.023
Cromwell's like,
"Stop being hard on yourself."

02:04.023 --> 02:07.627
"Do not worry.
I've found one for you."

02:07.627 --> 02:10.430
"Germany. Fit bird."

02:10.430 --> 02:14.033
"Holbein the Younger. Your artist."

02:14.033 --> 02:16.202
"He's gonna paint the shit
out of her."

02:17.604 --> 02:20.240
"Cromwell, cracking idea."

02:20.240 --> 02:25.545
"Holbein, you're quality at drawing,
painting, pictures."

02:29.015 --> 02:32.986
"Holbein, you're good at your job.
That's why I've got you."

02:33.853 --> 02:36.322
Holbein goes off,
does a quick painting.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.825
I don't know how long it took.
I wasn't there.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.996
He goes, "King Henry VIII,
this is Anne of Cleves."

02:42.996 --> 02:45.732
And King Henry VIII
could not be happier.

02:45.732 --> 02:51.571
He is like, "Yes, she is proper fit,
Holbein. That is a bit of me."

02:51.571 --> 02:55.241
"Boys, you've done good.
I've seen a lot of women,

02:55.241 --> 02:58.111
I've never been fully erect
at a painting before."

02:58.111 --> 03:00.747
"I've seen this bad-boy,
I've hit the roof."

03:02.448 --> 03:07.053
Anne of Cleves, beautiful.
What a painting, Holbein.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.089
Good work.

03:11.624 --> 03:15.361
There's a raise. Three guineas.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.431
Cromwell was like, "I've nailed it."

03:18.431 --> 03:22.435
Holbein's like, "I'm pretty good
at pho... paintings."

03:22.435 --> 03:25.371
"Job done. Bring her to me."

03:25.371 --> 03:30.643
She turns up in England
and Henry VIII is like,

03:30.643 --> 03:33.513
"Quality. She's here. She's in town."

03:33.513 --> 03:36.716
He's well up for it. He's happy.
He's excited. He's like,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.052
"Cleves is here!
Loving a bit of Cleves."

03:39.052 --> 03:42.555
"I've seen the painting,
now she's here. Say what!"

03:42.555 --> 03:45.825
That's what Henry VIII said.
Verbatim.

03:45.825 --> 03:49.329
THAT is in the books.
That is in the record books.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.732
He's excited.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.235
But he's almost too excited
that he can't see her first.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.237
He sends off his mate Browne.

03:59.238 --> 04:02.442
Andrew Browne,
I think that might be it.

04:02.442 --> 04:05.311
(man) It was Anthony.
Anthony Browne.

04:07.246 --> 04:10.516
And he turns up to see her.
He walks in...

04:13.786 --> 04:14.787
...sees her...

04:18.757 --> 04:19.959
...and he's worried.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.796
He's concerned.

04:23.796 --> 04:24.797
Because...

04:26.432 --> 04:29.035
...she is NOT the painting.

04:31.471 --> 04:34.707
I don't know if you've ever seen
anyone ravaged by smallpox.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.810
It's like Gremlins.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.013
"What am I gonna do?"

04:41.280 --> 04:47.120
Browne goes back to Henry and Henry
goes, "So, Browne, what's she like?"

04:49.255 --> 04:52.025
"I've had her transported
from Germany."

04:52.025 --> 04:54.027
And Browne looks at him in the eyes

04:54.027 --> 04:57.430
and does what any good man
or good friend would do and says,

04:57.430 --> 05:01.834
"Henry, she's absolutely quality,
mate."

05:02.835 --> 05:04.303
"You're gonna love her."

05:06.372 --> 05:08.374
Then Browne fucks right off.

05:12.845 --> 05:16.315
He's like, "Fuck this shit!
She's a rotter, he's got the hump,

05:16.315 --> 05:19.452
he loves a bit of the axe,
I'm getting right out of here."

05:19.452 --> 05:22.255
"I'm going to fucking Ibiza
for the season."

05:23.656 --> 05:25.825
What more could he do?

05:25.825 --> 05:28.628
Who's gonna... He kills his wives.

05:28.628 --> 05:32.231
What's he gonna do to his mate
that goes "Yeah, she's fucking..."

05:32.231 --> 05:33.433
(retches)

05:33.433 --> 05:35.835
"Henry, I've seen her." (retches)

05:36.803 --> 05:39.906
It's not on, is it?
You can't do that.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.841
"What did she look like?"

05:41.841 --> 05:44.444
"Not gonna lie to you, Henry."
(retches)

05:48.915 --> 05:50.917
(laughs)

05:59.025 --> 06:01.127
This is the best day of my life.

06:01.127 --> 06:05.765
I used to work at a fucking market.
I used to sell compost.

06:05.765 --> 06:10.369
I'm getting paid to get shit-faced.
It's like a weird dream.

06:10.369 --> 06:13.239
So Henry cannot wait to see
Anne of Cleves.

06:13.239 --> 06:16.242
He's looking at her portrait.
He's so excited.

06:16.242 --> 06:20.847
So what he does is
he decides to surprise her early,

06:20.847 --> 06:23.850
waps on his little disguise
and off he goes.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.254
I don't think "waps" is a word,
is it?

06:30.723 --> 06:34.627
Clevesie, she's sitting there,
he turns up, cops off with her,

06:34.627 --> 06:37.630
grabs her, she's like,
"What are you doing, mate?"

06:37.630 --> 06:41.834
Henry VIII, if you're gonna try
and pull a bird, dress as a king.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.036
I don't know a lot about
pulling women,

06:44.036 --> 06:46.606
but if I was a king,
I would dress as one.

06:46.606 --> 06:52.545
Anyway, he takes off all the
disguises, sees her, and he is like,

06:52.545 --> 06:54.547
"What the fucking hell is that?"

06:55.548 --> 06:57.383
"What am I gonna do?"

06:57.383 --> 07:00.186
"I can't do anything.
The treaty's been signed."

07:00.186 --> 07:02.789
"The purchase order
has been signed off."

07:02.789 --> 07:05.591
"I've got to do it."
He ends up having to marry her.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.194
So poor old Anne of Cleves
is at the end of the bed,

07:08.194 --> 07:11.430
she's in her lingerie. Anne
of Cleves in all her sexy outfit.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.200
She's at the end of the bed going,
"H."

07:14.200 --> 07:18.871
"Henry, Eight thereof. I'm yours."

07:18.871 --> 07:23.209
And he's like, "Fuck off, love."

07:25.211 --> 07:30.783
So basically, I know I am steaming
now, so hopefully, this is correct,

07:30.783 --> 07:35.488
they wouldn't have sex. Henry was
just like, "Ay, oh, no go."

07:35.488 --> 07:39.792
Because he wouldn't have sex
with her, he got it annulled.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.596
Then she got Hever Castle.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.398
How's that for a divorce?

07:45.398 --> 07:51.470
The moral of the story is
if your mate goes to Germany,

07:51.470 --> 07:54.974
draws a picture of a woman,
don't marry her.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.744
And I'm gonna be honest with you,

07:58.744 --> 08:01.113
I don't think you need me
to tell me you that.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.994
I'm absolutely fucked.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.198
'Henry VIII showing us
that even in the 16th century

08:19.198 --> 08:21.367
mail order brides were a bad idea.'

08:21.367 --> 08:24.871
''He should count himself lucky.
At least his didn't have a cock.'

08:24.871 --> 08:28.274
'That's it for part one.
After the break, Victoria's secret.'

08:28.274 --> 08:30.643
'Spoiler alert: She loved it.'

08:30.643 --> 08:33.746
I want that man in me.

08:39.986 --> 08:40.186
.

08:42.722 --> 08:42.989
.

08:42.989 --> 08:46.492
'Welcome back to Drunk History,
where we combine the two things

08:46.492 --> 08:49.996
that make Britain great. Making
history and getting hammered.'

08:49.996 --> 08:51.330
(laughs)

08:51.330 --> 08:56.002
'The only thing more wasted on TV
is birth control on Geordie Shore.'

09:00.673 --> 09:03.109
'Next up,
a surprising story that reveals

09:03.109 --> 09:06.712
just how much Queen Victoria
used to like it up the V and A.'

09:06.712 --> 09:08.047
One, two, three.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.752
Oh, you fucking bastard!

09:12.752 --> 09:16.088
'Seven vodka tonics and a couple
of Sambuca shots later,

09:16.088 --> 09:17.957
Kerry Howard with the details.'

09:17.957 --> 09:22.962
Welcome. What I'm gonna talk about
is the Victorian Era.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.532
It was a time of prudishness
and sexual repression.

09:26.532 --> 09:31.003
Ankles were not to be seen,
they were like tits.

09:31.003 --> 09:36.642
But, actually, under the cover of all
that chintz and... shit...

09:36.642 --> 09:41.147
...Queen Victoria was a raging
nympho, bloody loved it.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.816
She had a hungry fanny.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.919
Needed feedin'.

09:46.919 --> 09:51.524
So, the Queen Victoria has been,
er, the queen for a couple of years.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.492
The courtiers are worried because

09:53.492 --> 09:56.829
she hasn't made any sort of fixings
to get a husband.

09:56.829 --> 10:00.232
So, they all decide to go and
meet her cos she's a fierce woman.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.335
And she's like, "What? What? What?!"

10:02.335 --> 10:06.105
And they're like, "Sorry,
sorry, Queen, er, Victoria,

10:06.105 --> 10:09.508
we need to have a word with you."
"What? What's your problem?"

10:09.508 --> 10:14.814
(laughs nervously)
"You need to marry a husband

10:14.814 --> 10:18.751
and have an heir
to carry on the bloodline."

10:18.751 --> 10:24.190
"Right... yeah, obvious."

10:24.190 --> 10:27.893
"Well, we should set up
some dates for you, then?"

10:27.893 --> 10:31.731
"Yeah, you should!
Why hasn't it happened sooner?"

10:31.731 --> 10:34.834
"Line me up some fellas,
I choose the one,

10:34.834 --> 10:38.704
I'll make some babies
but hurry up, cos I'm starving."

10:38.704 --> 10:42.008
"And I mean... downstairs."

10:42.008 --> 10:47.346
So, the courtiers go out and scour
all of Europe and across the seas.

10:47.346 --> 10:50.716
Princes from Alcazan... Is that...

10:50.716 --> 10:53.519
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
I'm drunk, it's OK.

10:53.519 --> 10:56.722
But Europe,
to find eligible bachelors

10:56.722 --> 11:00.526
and they bring them back to Queen
Victoria and she looks at them,

11:00.526 --> 11:05.431
she's like, "Well, I've had him,
I've had him, I've had him."

11:05.431 --> 11:07.600
"Nope, nope, nope, nope."

11:07.600 --> 11:10.836
She's not impressed,
not impressed by any of them.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.839
And then she sees this guy
in the corner and she's like,

11:13.839 --> 11:18.444
"Who's that guy? I like him.
Set me up with him."

11:18.444 --> 11:23.649
"Er, yeah, well, the thing with
that is, er, Queen Victoria..."

11:23.649 --> 11:25.918
"Vicky. Call me Vicky."

11:25.918 --> 11:27.953
"OK, Vic."
"Thank you."

11:27.953 --> 11:32.091
"Vic, the thing is, that guy, erm,

11:32.091 --> 11:35.694
Albert, is-is-is your, er, cousin."

11:35.694 --> 11:39.031
"So, if you had children,

11:39.031 --> 11:44.637
they'd probably be sort of,
er, deformed,

11:44.637 --> 11:48.574
webbed, you know, not right."

11:48.574 --> 11:51.310
"Half my family are not right,
I don't give a shit."

11:51.310 --> 11:54.713
"I want that man in me."

11:54.713 --> 11:56.515
(laughs)

12:01.053 --> 12:04.356
So, the thing about Albert is,
he's not interested in women.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.726
He's camp, he's effeminate,
he likes talking about theatre.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.762
He's as soft as shite.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.599
He doesn't give a fuck about fanny.

12:13.599 --> 12:17.136
So, Albert was chosen
and all his peers were like,

12:17.136 --> 12:22.608
"Whoa, dude, er,
Queen Victoria wants to bone you!"

12:22.608 --> 12:26.479
"Mate, you've never had sex before.
You know what you're doing?"

12:26.479 --> 12:29.882
And he's like, "To be honest, erm,

12:29.882 --> 12:32.852
why would I want to go near a woman?"

12:32.852 --> 12:37.123
"They completely disgust me.
It's like a dragon down there

12:37.123 --> 12:40.726
and I don't want to
touch that dragon."

12:40.726 --> 12:44.730
So, the courtiers organise for
Albert and Queen Victoria to meet

12:44.730 --> 12:46.999
for the first time and she's like,

12:46.999 --> 12:50.002
"Hiya, yeah, I know I'm the Queen
and all that,

12:50.002 --> 12:53.072
but I don't want that
to be an issue between us."

12:53.072 --> 12:55.875
"Do you know what I'm saying...
Bert?"

12:55.875 --> 13:00.813
And he's like, "It's Albert."
"Shh, Princess. shut up."

13:00.813 --> 13:04.650
"I'm gonna 'ave ya.
You're gonna be my wife."

13:04.650 --> 13:06.085
"Husband."

13:06.085 --> 13:08.988
And Albert's like,
"(swallows nervously)."

13:08.988 --> 13:12.491
He couldn't refuse her cos she was
the Queen so he had to say yes,

13:12.491 --> 13:15.561
otherwise she probably could've
sent him to the tower.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.896
Killed him.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.036
(spits)

13:24.036 --> 13:27.973
So, the wedding day came
and they had the ceremony,

13:27.973 --> 13:31.143
they had the cakes, the speeches,
Queen Victoria's like,

13:31.143 --> 13:34.046
"Whatever, don't matter." (burps)
"Had the dance."

13:34.046 --> 13:36.482
"Let's fucking get out of here,
Bert."

13:36.482 --> 13:39.451
And she gets him upstairs,
shuts the door,

13:39.451 --> 13:42.388
he is petrified,
he's never had sex before.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.891
And Albert's like, "Er, maybe
we should do some more speeches."

13:45.891 --> 13:51.030
And she just pounces on him
and fucks him, fucks him good.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.971
She was like, "That was
the best night of my life."

13:58.971 --> 14:03.676
"You know what, Bert?
You're the one."

14:03.676 --> 14:07.813
"I'm gonna this to you
every night of your life."

14:10.883 --> 14:14.286
And Albert just muffled a cry,

14:14.286 --> 14:18.190
like, "(sobs) I love you."

14:18.190 --> 14:22.094
Luckily for Albert,
they got pregnant pretty quick

14:22.094 --> 14:24.964
because she was on him
like a hound dog

14:24.964 --> 14:30.169
and Albert, the doctor approached
Albert first and said, "Well done,

14:30.169 --> 14:34.707
you've got the Queen pregnant,
that's what we wanted. Good on you."

14:34.707 --> 14:36.575
And Albert's like, "What?"

14:36.575 --> 14:41.213
"Can you just tell her that while
she's pregnant she can't have sex?"

14:41.213 --> 14:45.651
"Maybe if I gave you some...
some money? Might work?"

14:45.651 --> 14:49.989
And the doctor's like...
"OK, I can make that work."

14:49.989 --> 14:53.492
So. the doctor says, "Hey, Vicky,
good news, you're pregnant."

14:53.492 --> 14:57.496
"Bad news is Mum's
gotta shut up shop, I'm sorry."

14:57.496 --> 15:01.867
And she's like, "Yeah, all right,
I won't have sex with him for..."

15:01.867 --> 15:04.036
"How many... Like five months?"

15:04.036 --> 15:07.239
"Nine months."
"Fucking, I... all right."

15:07.239 --> 15:10.609
"Nine months, shit!"

15:10.609 --> 15:11.944
She leaves Albert alone

15:11.944 --> 15:16.749
while she has a gestational period
with the baby.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.119
So, no sooner,
she's just had a baby,

15:20.119 --> 15:22.655
they've got this new, lovely,
beautiful life

15:22.655 --> 15:24.123
and she's like, "Albert!"

15:24.123 --> 15:28.427
And he's like, "We've just had
a beautiful child."

15:28.427 --> 15:30.929
And she's like,
"Yeah. Get your knob out."

15:32.531 --> 15:36.001
And the next 17 years, the poor guy
just got fucked to death.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.904
Like, day in, day out.

15:38.904 --> 15:43.042
So, after 17 years of marriage,
nine babies,

15:43.042 --> 15:48.947
Albert was fat, bloated,
wheezing, exhausted.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.115
He looked like shit.

15:50.115 --> 15:55.788
But, luckily, the doctor who was
Albert's friend weighed in and said,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.424
"Vic, I'll be straight with you,
as a doctor."

15:58.424 --> 16:03.962
"If you have sex and if you conceive
another baby, it will kill you."

16:05.264 --> 16:08.734
"What? I'm 38."

16:08.734 --> 16:12.271
"Yeah, but you've had nine children."

16:12.271 --> 16:13.439
"What you saying?"

16:13.439 --> 16:17.376
"I'm saying you can't have sex
any more, it'll kill you."

16:17.376 --> 16:22.147
"Right, right. Oh...
I've got a headache right now."

16:22.147 --> 16:25.684
"Right, OK, fine, fine. Fine!"

16:25.684 --> 16:29.755
So, she takes it on the chin.
She's not happy, she's not happy.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.424
And Albert has a little chat
with the doctor.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.728
"Thank you, thank you so much."

16:35.728 --> 16:39.932
The doctor's like, "Look, you don't
need to pay me, her fanny is ruined."

16:39.932 --> 16:42.868
"You shouldn't have sex
cos you could kill her."

16:42.868 --> 16:44.336
"You can't do it any more.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.171
And Albert's like, "Thank you!"

16:46.171 --> 16:49.274
"That's the best news
I've ever heard in my life."

16:49.274 --> 16:51.009
"Now I can finally live."

16:51.009 --> 16:55.047
And then Albert
has four years of bliss

16:55.047 --> 16:59.985
without having to be pummelled
every night by Queen Nympho.

16:59.985 --> 17:03.689
She leaves him alone,
she takes the doctor's orders.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.023
And then he's dead.

17:06.023 --> 17:09.094
But then the doctors do a diagnosis
once he's dead

17:09.094 --> 17:14.266
and they realise that
his body is ruined, ravished,

17:14.266 --> 17:17.202
and, erm, she did that, she did that.

17:17.202 --> 17:22.840
But in death, our Albert,
he finally found peace.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.679
And then the Angels fucked him.
(laughs)

17:29.681 --> 17:33.519
Cos they're deviants as well.
(giggles)

17:36.455 --> 17:38.524
'Prince Albert, a man who engineered

17:38.524 --> 17:40.993
massive social change
and monarchy reform

17:40.993 --> 17:44.530
and is fondly remembered by
our nation for his pierced bellend.'

17:44.530 --> 17:48.333
'Finally tonight, the story of
death, decay, sickness and misery.'

17:48.333 --> 17:52.204
'But what was life like in Scotland
in the olden days? Let's find out.'

17:53.038 --> 17:54.640
''After three Pina Coladas,

17:54.640 --> 17:58.510
three whiskey sours and a couple
of beers, here's James Acaster.'

17:58.510 --> 18:02.314
Hey! J'bronies, watching at home.

18:02.314 --> 18:07.486
It was 1350. England and Scotland
hated each other,

18:07.486 --> 18:10.289
but the English get the plague.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.992
"Oh, my God!" (chokes)

18:13.992 --> 18:16.195
(burps) Dying.

18:16.195 --> 18:20.432
Chins falling off, butts falling off.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.335
Nipples... (kapow) off!

18:23.335 --> 18:26.438
"High five?" "Yeah, why not?"

18:26.438 --> 18:27.673
Arm falls off.

18:27.673 --> 18:32.511
Up in Scotland,
zero plague whatsoever.

18:32.511 --> 18:36.482
The Scottish believed that the plague

18:36.482 --> 18:39.518
was the act of God
punishing the English.

18:39.518 --> 18:43.589
Robert the Steward,
in charge of Scotland at the time,

18:43.589 --> 18:46.825
he saw this as a prime opportunity
to conquer them.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.828
"Hey, all my Scottish soldiers,

18:49.828 --> 18:55.934
go down there, beat the English,
come back, KitKats for lunchtime."

18:55.934 --> 18:58.837
Some of the Scottish soldiers
said to them,

18:58.837 --> 19:01.907
"Hey, man,
what if we catch the plague?"

19:01.907 --> 19:06.478
The boss said, "Hey, you're not gonna
get the plague, you're Scottish."

19:06.478 --> 19:07.546
"You're fine."

19:07.546 --> 19:12.851
So, Scots go down to England,
planted, ready to attack.

19:12.851 --> 19:17.322
But one of the Scots is coughing.
There's a bit of a splutter.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.292
The others think,
"He's just winding us up."

19:20.292 --> 19:24.663
One soldier turns to the other one
and he's like, "Hey, man."

19:24.663 --> 19:29.034
"I'm feeling pretty ill..."
Before he even gets the word ill,

19:29.034 --> 19:33.805
he starts puking out of his butt,
onto the soldier behind him.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.643
He starts saying,
"I'm feeling a bit..."

19:37.643 --> 19:39.278
And then out of his mouth,

19:39.278 --> 19:43.715
onto the head of the soldier who just
puked out of his butt onto him.

19:43.715 --> 19:44.950
Ugh!

19:44.950 --> 19:49.788
And then puke out of everyone's
butt and mouth onto each other,

19:49.788 --> 19:52.124
everywhere.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.894
(high-pitched puking sound)

19:57.529 --> 19:59.331
Like a... Like a fax.

19:59.331 --> 20:03.268
The Scots knew they didn't
stand a chance and they turned

20:03.268 --> 20:08.040
and they fled back to Scotland,
taking the plague with them.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.210
Scottish got back,
Robert The Steward, he starts saying,

20:12.210 --> 20:14.880
"Hey, did you get rid of
those English people?"

20:14.880 --> 20:17.916
"Er, that's by the...
That's neither here nor there."

20:17.916 --> 20:19.484
"Don't ask us about that."

20:19.484 --> 20:21.887
"Seriously,
did you get rid of them or not?"

20:21.887 --> 20:25.958
"No. We went down there, we got the
plague and then we came back to you."

20:25.958 --> 20:27.926
"Oh, Jesus Christ!"

20:27.926 --> 20:30.963
Summing up: Within weeks,

20:30.963 --> 20:35.167
20% of Scotland had been wiped out.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.135
Just... dead.

20:38.236 --> 20:41.473
Dead. Like doornails.

20:43.275 --> 20:48.714
On the feet... of the righteous....

20:50.082 --> 20:51.650
...walking into Heaven.

20:53.151 --> 20:56.922
'We gave them the black death,
they gave us Susan Boyle.'

20:56.922 --> 20:58.390
'Let's call it even.'

20:58.390 --> 21:01.493
'Join us next week when
we reopen the history books

21:01.493 --> 21:04.563
and that sherry at the back
of the kitchen cupboard.'

21:04.563 --> 21:05.931
'Thanks for watching

21:05.931 --> 21:09.801
and remember, it's only binge
drinking if you stop. Goodnight.'
