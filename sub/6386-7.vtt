00:02.562 --> 00:04.163
Hey, is this Runkle's house?

00:04.197 --> 00:05.464
Who the fuck are you?

00:05.499 --> 00:06.632
Stu Beggs.
You're the wife?

00:06.667 --> 00:07.900
Soon to be ex.

00:07.934 --> 00:09.669
Want to know how many women
I've slept with?

00:09.703 --> 00:10.736
Mm-mmm.

00:10.771 --> 00:11.971
I gotta get it up to 100.

00:12.005 --> 00:14.073
Triple digits.

00:14.107 --> 00:15.741
- I met the wife.
- Soon to be ex.

00:15.776 --> 00:17.810
So you wouldn't mind
if I took a crack at her?

00:17.844 --> 00:19.478
Say what?

00:19.513 --> 00:20.680
And you are?

00:20.714 --> 00:22.615
- I'm Ben.
- Karen.

00:22.649 --> 00:23.616
Nice to meet you.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.750
Nice to meet you too.

00:24.785 --> 00:25.785
How's Lenny Kravitz?

00:25.819 --> 00:26.886
Excuse me?

00:28.155 --> 00:29.121
You've been hanging
around with.

00:29.156 --> 00:30.790
Um, none of your business.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.357
Abby here is the best there is

00:32.392 --> 00:34.126
at defending
the unjustly accused.

00:34.161 --> 00:35.261
You really love this shit, huh?

00:35.295 --> 00:36.762
Sometimes it's
even better than sex.

00:36.797 --> 00:39.131
You must not like sex
very much.

00:55.849 --> 00:57.516
Hey!

00:57.551 --> 01:00.286
Am I really
that scary the morning after?

01:00.320 --> 01:02.588
Hardly. You're
just really penetrating me

01:02.622 --> 01:04.022
with those pretty blue eyes.

01:04.057 --> 01:05.791
They're hazel.

01:05.826 --> 01:07.827
Are they?

01:07.861 --> 01:10.196
It's early and you got
a bunch of cruddies in there.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.430
Thank you.

01:11.465 --> 01:13.766
Yes, no. Oh, that's right,
hazel they are.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.201
Still pretty, though.

01:17.003 --> 01:19.071
Well, I suppose
one good penetration

01:19.106 --> 01:20.406
does deserve another.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.308
Ooh, I like where
you're going with this.

01:22.342 --> 01:23.943
I love me some morning sex.

01:23.977 --> 01:25.845
Daylight, smelly pits,
bad breath.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.680
Bring it.
Let's do this.

01:27.714 --> 01:29.315
I need to recuse myself.

01:29.349 --> 01:30.983
Recuse me?

01:31.017 --> 01:32.685
I'm being serious.

01:32.719 --> 01:34.086
Well, the bathroom is
that-a-way.

01:34.121 --> 01:35.187
We had sex, Hank.

01:35.222 --> 01:36.388
Don't do that.

01:36.423 --> 01:38.324
Don't... don't reduce it.

01:38.358 --> 01:39.391
That was not sex.

01:39.426 --> 01:41.660
- That was naked poetry.
- Oh, okay.

01:41.695 --> 01:43.829
I haven't been fucked like
that since I was an altar boy.

01:43.864 --> 01:45.664
- Really? Are you finished?
- No, I'm not finished.

01:45.699 --> 01:47.166
I'm just getting started,
counselor.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.434
- You're not listening.
- No, I'm not,

01:48.468 --> 01:49.902
because I'm too busy
reading your braille.

01:49.936 --> 01:51.871
Ahem.

01:51.905 --> 01:52.938
I'm a lip-reader,

01:52.973 --> 01:54.607
and I can also read
upside down,

01:54.641 --> 01:55.708
and you know what it says?

01:55.742 --> 01:57.510
"Shut up and fuck me."

01:57.544 --> 01:59.578
We had sex.
You made me come.

01:59.613 --> 02:00.846
Don't sell yourself short.

02:00.881 --> 02:02.748
I invited you to come.

02:02.783 --> 02:03.849
You did all the rest.

02:03.884 --> 02:06.385
And now we have
a serious conflict.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.354
I'm not the greatest
of legal minds,

02:08.388 --> 02:10.923
but, last night, when we made
the beast with two backs,

02:10.957 --> 02:13.559
I don't believe that you
were technically my attorney.

02:13.593 --> 02:16.428
Yeah, yes, and that logic

02:16.463 --> 02:19.498
was perfectly,
perfectly sound last night.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.066
This morning, not so much.

02:21.101 --> 02:23.335
Last night, this morning,
what's the diff, really?

02:23.370 --> 02:25.504
What's it all about anyway?

02:25.539 --> 02:27.039
It's your choice, Hank.

02:27.073 --> 02:28.440
What do you want me to do?

02:28.475 --> 02:30.409
Fuck you or defend you?

02:30.443 --> 02:31.811
Oh, shit.

02:31.845 --> 02:33.579
There's a really good lawyer
joke in there somewhere,

02:33.613 --> 02:35.214
but there's not enough blood
in my brain

02:35.248 --> 02:37.149
to figure it our right now.

02:37.184 --> 02:38.684
Okay, I'm introducing you
to a new attorney.

02:38.718 --> 02:39.718
No, I like my old one.

02:39.753 --> 02:41.453
And she likes you too.

02:41.488 --> 02:42.922
A little too much maybe.

02:42.956 --> 02:45.124
How much are we talking?

02:45.158 --> 02:48.260
Read my braille.

02:52.365 --> 02:54.400
Wow.

02:54.434 --> 02:56.168
That speaks volumes.

03:05.011 --> 03:09.448
So...What's it gonna be?

03:09.482 --> 03:11.584
Oh, you're recused.

03:14.621 --> 03:24.627
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>

03:59.666 --> 04:01.200
Hello?

04:01.234 --> 04:02.735
Hello!

04:02.769 --> 04:04.203
Good morning.

04:04.237 --> 04:05.905
Good morning.

04:05.939 --> 04:07.339
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

04:07.374 --> 04:08.774
Well, your door was ajar.

04:08.808 --> 04:10.709
I just wanted to make sure you
hadn't been violated.

04:10.744 --> 04:13.479
Oh. So what are you,
Robin Hood of rapists now?

04:13.513 --> 04:14.513
Oh, good one.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.281
And I just wanted to say hello.

04:16.315 --> 04:18.517
Hello and good-bye!

04:18.551 --> 04:20.084
I have some time to kill.
I have an appointment.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.387
I brought you some coffee.

04:21.421 --> 04:23.589
How do you take it now?
Black?

04:23.623 --> 04:25.424
- Thanks, brother.
- Oh, fuck.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.927
Cheers.

04:29.029 --> 04:31.230
So, what, you guys
are doing it now?

04:31.264 --> 04:32.598
Shut up.
It's none of your business.

04:32.632 --> 04:33.866
It is my business.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.634
That was my vagina
for a very, very long time.

04:35.669 --> 04:37.136
I have squatter's rights
on that.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.637
Ben brought me a painting,

04:38.672 --> 04:40.272
and he was hanging it up for me

04:40.307 --> 04:41.707
in the bedroom, okay?

04:41.741 --> 04:42.808
Oh, that is smooth, Ben.

04:42.842 --> 04:44.710
Real smooth.
What was the occasion?

04:44.744 --> 04:45.744
Doing it?

04:45.779 --> 04:47.346
Ben is an artist, Hank.

04:47.380 --> 04:48.881
Oh, fuck, aren't we all?

04:48.915 --> 04:50.883
Actually, I am an artist
by profession.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.384
It says so on my tax return.

04:52.419 --> 04:54.253
Well, sometimes
in the bathroom,

04:54.287 --> 04:56.622
I will draw on the wall
with my own poo.

04:56.656 --> 04:58.090
Doesn't make me
a fucking artist, does it?

04:58.124 --> 04:59.792
- No.
- Poo-casso.

04:59.826 --> 05:00.893
It makes you a grown man

05:00.927 --> 05:01.927
who likes to play
with his excrement.

05:01.962 --> 05:03.629
Exactly, Karen.
Exactly.

05:03.663 --> 05:05.564
I design album covers.

05:05.598 --> 05:07.399
Wow, that is
buttfucking awesome, Ben.

05:07.434 --> 05:09.001
You are very hard to hate.

05:09.035 --> 05:10.769
Hey, guess what.

05:10.804 --> 05:12.304
I did it last night too...

05:12.339 --> 05:13.605
With a woman.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.075
A woman?
A grown woman?

05:16.109 --> 05:18.410
An extremely hot,
totally sexy woman.

05:18.445 --> 05:20.479
- Class up the wazoo, right?
- Good for you.

05:20.513 --> 05:21.780
A real fucking dame, that one.

05:21.815 --> 05:22.781
Good for you, Hank.

05:22.816 --> 05:24.550
No, good for us, Karen.

05:24.584 --> 05:25.918
'Cause we're moving on.

05:25.952 --> 05:27.686
We're sharing our genitals
with other people.

05:27.721 --> 05:29.388
It's so fucking mature, I want
to punch myself in the dick.

05:29.422 --> 05:30.589
Do it!

05:30.623 --> 05:32.424
Listen, not that
I'm not enjoying this,

05:32.459 --> 05:33.993
whatever this is,

05:34.027 --> 05:36.362
but I just feel like maybe I
should try and put a stop to it.

05:36.396 --> 05:37.496
Yes, that would be a good idea,

05:37.530 --> 05:38.831
and good luck, 'cause...

05:38.865 --> 05:40.366
Yeah,
that would be a good idea,

05:40.400 --> 05:41.533
- and good luck, 'cause...
- I'm gonna stab you.

05:41.568 --> 05:42.701
Fuck you.

05:42.736 --> 05:43.936
Did you tell him
about the girls?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.637
No, she didn't tell me
about the fucking girls.

05:45.672 --> 05:46.872
She doesn't tell me
anything anymore.

05:46.906 --> 05:48.107
They're doing
an unplugged gig tonight.

05:48.141 --> 05:49.108
You should come.

05:49.142 --> 05:50.442
Well, that's interesting.

05:50.477 --> 05:52.311
Maybe I will.

05:52.345 --> 05:53.979
Maybe I won't.

05:54.014 --> 05:56.482
Guess you'll just to have wait
and see, you two, won't you?

05:56.516 --> 05:57.816
I'm excited.

06:01.187 --> 06:02.821
We have a proposition
for you, Runkle.

06:02.856 --> 06:04.990
Okay, let me
just throw it out there.

06:05.025 --> 06:07.659
This is not a threesome
I am interested in at all.

06:07.694 --> 06:10.262
We, neither,
you fucking jackass.

06:10.296 --> 06:12.898
Well, I'm open...
Sexually.

06:12.932 --> 06:14.700
I mean,
I just want you to know that.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.535
Stu, shut the fuck up.

06:16.569 --> 06:19.204
Okay. So here's the deal.

06:19.239 --> 06:22.107
We have a pitch meeting
today at Showtime,

06:22.142 --> 06:24.543
at FX, and HBO tomorrow.

06:24.577 --> 06:26.912
But I think showtime is
the right place for this.

06:26.946 --> 06:29.348
<i>Nurse Jackie,</i> I like that shit.

06:29.382 --> 06:31.884
Edie Falco. Respect.

06:31.918 --> 06:33.218
What's the pitch?

06:33.253 --> 06:36.522
Well...

06:36.556 --> 06:38.357
You were married to her.

06:43.096 --> 06:44.196
I don't get it.

06:44.230 --> 06:45.631
See?
He's not a visionary, Stu.

06:45.665 --> 06:46.965
I told you.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.367
It's a down and dirty
half-hour

06:48.401 --> 06:51.036
about a foul-mouthed celebrity
waxologist.

06:51.071 --> 06:54.173
Punani-tender to the stars,
if you will,

06:54.207 --> 06:56.341
based on hers truly.

06:56.376 --> 06:58.944
You know what?

06:58.978 --> 07:01.113
That's not a bad idea.

07:01.147 --> 07:02.414
- Thank you.
- Really?

07:02.449 --> 07:04.817
Well, how come you never thought
of it, brain trust?

07:04.851 --> 07:07.019
Obviously,
I was too close to it.

07:07.053 --> 07:10.189
I was too busy
being emasculated by it.

07:10.223 --> 07:12.357
Don't blame me because you
were born with a clit for a cock

07:12.392 --> 07:15.994
and a tiny little beanbag
to house what passes for balls.

07:16.029 --> 07:17.996
See? Magic.

07:21.534 --> 07:23.368
Don't you worry, Hank.
Abby's the best.

07:23.403 --> 07:25.671
But even the best need
a little help sometimes.

07:25.705 --> 07:26.772
Isn't that right, Abby?

07:26.806 --> 07:28.841
Absolutely, Lloyd.
You are the man.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.044
I'll take care of you.

07:32.078 --> 07:33.445
Thank you,
Lloyd Alan Phillips, Jr.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.147
I feel safe with you.

07:35.181 --> 07:36.748
What are you reading right now?

07:36.783 --> 07:38.517
What am I reading?

07:38.551 --> 07:40.052
What's on your nightstand
right now?

07:40.086 --> 07:42.287
That's an interesting question.

07:42.322 --> 07:45.057
Um, bottle of Heineken,

07:45.091 --> 07:46.125
pack of smokes,

07:46.159 --> 07:48.260
the accommodator.
Oh.

07:48.294 --> 07:49.294
Oh, the accommodator?

07:49.329 --> 07:50.762
Is that like a novel?

07:50.797 --> 07:52.397
No, no, no.
It's more like a sex toy.

07:52.432 --> 07:53.599
A dildo, essentially,

07:53.633 --> 07:55.100
only you strap it to your head

07:55.135 --> 07:57.436
so that the dong part
juts out from your chin.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.571
It enables you
to "accommodate" your lady

07:59.606 --> 08:02.141
by performing oral and
penetrato at the same time.

08:02.175 --> 08:04.443
You know, like...

08:04.477 --> 08:05.611
Something like this.

08:05.645 --> 08:06.912
Like Chinocchio?

08:06.946 --> 08:08.380
- Chinocchio.
- Interesting.

08:08.414 --> 08:10.048
I think it's very interesting.
I can hook you up.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.216
You too, Abby.

08:11.251 --> 08:12.951
Thank you, Hank.
That's generous of you.

08:12.986 --> 08:14.286
You seem to be
in pretty good shape.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.888
Where do you work out?
You do the steps?

08:15.922 --> 08:17.523
The steps?

08:17.557 --> 08:19.958
- In Santa Monica.
- Oh.

08:19.993 --> 08:21.727
It's quite a scene.
Lots of lovely ladies.

08:21.761 --> 08:23.262
You can really make
a day of it.

08:23.296 --> 08:26.465
Yeah. Yeah.

08:26.499 --> 08:28.667
What's up?
You need something?

08:28.701 --> 08:30.068
I was just thinking...

08:30.103 --> 08:32.804
If I wanted to hang myself,

08:32.839 --> 08:34.072
do you think
this chandelier here

08:34.107 --> 08:36.275
would support my weight there?

08:36.308 --> 08:37.609
Uh...

08:37.644 --> 08:40.245
About 175, 180?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.447
You have an interesting
sense of humor, Hank.

08:42.482 --> 08:44.550
That's what they tell me,
Lloyd Alan Phillips, Jr.

08:44.584 --> 08:47.152
Well, I like to take care
of myself these days.

08:47.187 --> 08:48.554
Had a bit of a scare last year.

08:48.588 --> 08:49.788
Did you?

08:49.822 --> 08:51.256
Yeah, nothing...
nothing serious.

08:51.291 --> 08:52.791
Just an anal fissure.

08:52.825 --> 08:53.959
You know what that is, Hank?

08:55.862 --> 08:57.296
It's like
a small rip or tear...

08:57.330 --> 08:58.797
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.566
In the skin of the anal canal.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.402
Well, hurt
like a son of a bitch.

09:03.436 --> 09:04.536
Only thing that got me through

09:04.571 --> 09:06.138
was the thought
of getting back to the game.

09:06.172 --> 09:07.406
You play, Hank?

09:07.440 --> 09:10.342
No! I'm more
of a miniature golfer myself.

09:10.376 --> 09:12.277
We should play,
the three of us.

09:12.312 --> 09:14.613
Today. You guys
can get me up to speed.

09:14.647 --> 09:16.248
I'll go and check with Lindsay,

09:16.282 --> 09:17.549
see if she
can clear my schedule.

09:17.584 --> 09:20.352
- Great.
- Oh, this is not good.

09:22.288 --> 09:23.755
You made your bed,

09:23.790 --> 09:25.490
and then you fucked me in it.

09:25.525 --> 09:27.392
Mm-hmm-hmm. I think I
need to recuse myself.

09:27.427 --> 09:29.595
It's impossible.
He's my boss.

09:29.629 --> 09:31.196
I mean, I can't
just go to him and say,

09:31.231 --> 09:32.431
"Uh, hey, Lloyd, sorry.

09:32.465 --> 09:33.665
Hank thinks
you're a big bore."

09:33.700 --> 09:35.067
But he is a big fucking bore.

09:35.101 --> 09:36.535
But maybe that's a good thing.

09:36.569 --> 09:38.370
Maybe that will prevent you
from sticking your dick in him.

09:38.404 --> 09:39.871
I would never stick
my dick in him.

09:39.906 --> 09:42.074
It would fall off
from complete and utter boredom.

09:42.108 --> 09:43.976
Get dir... get directions
from Patti.

09:44.010 --> 09:47.579
I'll see you out on the links.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.051
Ooh!

09:55.888 --> 09:58.724
Did he tell you
about his anal fissure?

09:58.758 --> 09:59.791
Yes. Yes, he did.

09:59.826 --> 10:01.226
He's the fissure king.

10:01.261 --> 10:03.528
I'm sorry.
He's the worst.

10:03.563 --> 10:05.831
I don't know
how you stand it here, Patti.

10:05.865 --> 10:07.366
Me, neither. All the guys
around here are like that.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.369
Sometimes I think
I'm never gonna find a man.

10:10.403 --> 10:12.871
What kind of fella
you looking for?

10:12.905 --> 10:15.741
Honestly?
I just need to get laid.

10:15.775 --> 10:17.776
I hear that.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.278
You know what?
I think can help out.

10:19.312 --> 10:21.146
I got a guy for you.
He's a sure thing.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.415
Total chrome dome,
but he fucks like a champ.

10:23.449 --> 10:25.150
Loves to eat the pussy too.

10:27.387 --> 10:28.787
I'm listening.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.127
Hoo.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.798
You a little nervous
there, huh?

10:39.832 --> 10:42.134
You never have been
one for sales, have you?

10:42.168 --> 10:43.368
No.

10:43.403 --> 10:45.470
Fuck you.
Stop trying to psych me out.

10:45.505 --> 10:46.638
You know what?
I'm the nervous one.

10:46.673 --> 10:48.507
I got the fucking runs.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.909
I think I have a little IBS.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.511
A little TMI.

10:52.545 --> 10:53.545
I'm sorry, my dear.

10:53.579 --> 10:54.846
Not to worry.

10:54.881 --> 10:56.315
It always happens
before a pitch.

10:56.349 --> 10:58.550
It's a ritual cleansing.

11:06.059 --> 11:07.159
So...

11:07.193 --> 11:08.226
Be quiet.

11:08.261 --> 11:09.561
What? What? No.

11:09.595 --> 11:12.230
I was just... I was going to
ask about you and Stu.

11:12.265 --> 11:14.266
Stu and you.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.901
Mar-Stu, ha!

11:15.935 --> 11:17.202
That's what the rags
would be calling it.

11:17.236 --> 11:19.037
Mar-Stu.

11:19.072 --> 11:21.707
So, how's it going?

11:21.741 --> 11:23.008
Whatever.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.209
He's nice.

11:24.243 --> 11:26.278
Nice.

11:26.312 --> 11:27.612
Do you like him?

11:27.647 --> 11:29.948
Yes, I like him, Charlie, okay?

11:29.982 --> 11:32.451
It's nice to be with
a fucking grown-up for once.

11:32.485 --> 11:34.586
I used to be a grown-up...

11:34.620 --> 11:36.121
Once.

11:36.155 --> 11:37.756
I just...

11:37.790 --> 11:39.024
Regressed a little.

11:39.058 --> 11:40.459
A little?

11:40.493 --> 11:43.095
You're like a bald Benjamin
Button, aging in reverse.

11:43.129 --> 11:45.330
You're going to die a big,
pink, quivering jell-o baby.

11:45.365 --> 11:46.565
Come on.

11:46.599 --> 11:49.501
Whatever's going on
between the two of you,

11:49.535 --> 11:53.338
I hope you find
all the happiness you deserve.

11:53.373 --> 11:54.740
I mean that.

11:56.676 --> 11:58.543
Thanks, Charlie.

12:02.281 --> 12:04.449
And you're gonna
do great in there.

12:07.420 --> 12:10.055
Okay. That is better.

12:10.089 --> 12:12.791
Got all the poison out.

12:12.825 --> 12:13.992
So, we ready to do this?

12:14.026 --> 12:16.595
- Mm.
- Okay, let's huddle up.

12:16.629 --> 12:17.963
Come on.

12:17.997 --> 12:19.598
- Yes.
- There we go, there we go.

12:48.027 --> 12:49.294
Okay.

12:52.799 --> 12:54.666
Motherfucker.

12:57.370 --> 12:59.404
I'm sorry, sir.
Collared shirts only.

12:59.439 --> 13:01.306
And no denim.

13:01.340 --> 13:02.441
What are you,
some kind of fascist?

13:02.475 --> 13:03.608
What have you
got against denim?

13:03.643 --> 13:04.976
It's the people's fabric.

13:05.011 --> 13:07.546
I can show you to
the pro shop if you'd like, sir.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.681
Run. Save yourself.

13:15.521 --> 13:16.855
Oh, my God.

13:16.889 --> 13:19.024
This is just too delicious.

13:19.058 --> 13:20.659
I hate myself,
and I want to die.

13:20.693 --> 13:22.627
We are going to
have much fun out there.

13:22.662 --> 13:24.129
- That's impossible.
- Think about it.

13:24.163 --> 13:25.730
We can have
guilt-free sex now.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.766
- I wasn't guilty.
- Well, I was.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.669
Well, sometimes guilt can
make the sex better, you know?

13:30.703 --> 13:32.304
Sometimes it can.

13:32.338 --> 13:33.839
Oh!

13:33.873 --> 13:35.440
Dressing room quickie?

13:35.475 --> 13:37.042
I'll let you play
with my putter. Come on.

13:37.076 --> 13:39.845
- Ahem.
- Looking good, Hank.

13:39.879 --> 13:41.947
You guys ready to go to church?

13:41.981 --> 13:43.615
Hmm.

13:43.649 --> 13:46.218
Roberta, would you believe me

13:46.252 --> 13:49.588
if I told you
we have your next <i>Weeds?</i>

13:49.622 --> 13:51.056
Great.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.691
Tell us.

13:52.725 --> 13:55.460
The name of the show is
<i>Hot Lips.</i>

13:55.495 --> 13:57.395
Yeah.

13:57.430 --> 13:59.297
It's centers
around the sexploits

13:59.332 --> 14:01.800
of an esthetician of the stars.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.469
What is it like to stare
into the business end

14:04.504 --> 14:06.938
of Sandy Bullock's vagina?

14:06.973 --> 14:09.641
This woman knows.

14:09.675 --> 14:12.077
What's it like
to take off the hair

14:12.111 --> 14:14.946
from Robin Williams'
mammoth ballsack?

14:14.981 --> 14:18.049
This woman is familiar
with every vein.

14:18.084 --> 14:19.718
I don't...

14:19.752 --> 14:23.255
I don't do balls, so...

14:25.458 --> 14:27.259
Well, that's good news.

14:27.293 --> 14:30.729
But anyway, uh...

14:32.598 --> 14:33.899
But...Unh!

14:33.933 --> 14:36.601
Oh! Ahem.

14:36.636 --> 14:39.771
Marcy has stories and stories
and stories

14:39.805 --> 14:41.072
that go for days
and days and days,

14:41.107 --> 14:44.009
so I'm gonna hand it off to her,

14:44.043 --> 14:46.978
and if you will
kindly excuse me,

14:47.013 --> 14:48.947
I'm having
a little tummy trouble.

14:55.888 --> 14:57.656
Um, yeah.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.324
I, uh...

14:59.358 --> 15:01.493
I got some stories, kids.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.762
I've, uh, seen some shit.

15:03.796 --> 15:05.797
I've seen...

15:07.867 --> 15:12.437
I've got stories...
Damn.

15:12.471 --> 15:15.240
I got stories that'll
straighten your pubes.

15:18.377 --> 15:21.079
Maybe you could tell us one.

15:21.113 --> 15:24.616
Yeah, of course.
I, um...

15:24.650 --> 15:29.020
Shit, uh, let me think.

15:29.055 --> 15:30.722
Uh, uh,

15:30.756 --> 15:34.492
'cause I'm totally fucking
drawing a blank here.

15:34.527 --> 15:36.127
Um...

15:36.162 --> 15:37.462
So...

15:37.496 --> 15:41.132
Marcy gets a call
from a very famous actress.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.101
I'm not gonna name
any names here.

15:43.135 --> 15:44.669
Nicole.

15:44.704 --> 15:46.171
It's an emergency.

15:46.205 --> 15:47.839
She's shooting at Universal.

15:47.873 --> 15:51.142
Her leading man has been
flirting with her all day long.

15:51.177 --> 15:52.444
Sean.

15:52.478 --> 15:54.179
He wants to see her
in his trailer

15:54.213 --> 15:57.115
to talk about the script,
Haiti, whatever.

15:57.149 --> 15:59.484
Clearly it is on.

15:59.518 --> 16:01.920
But Nicole is sporting

16:01.954 --> 16:04.356
kind of a winter bush
situation down south,

16:04.390 --> 16:05.991
if you know what I mean.

16:06.025 --> 16:09.461
What is a hairy-scary
"A"-lister to do?

16:09.495 --> 16:11.563
She calls the Marster
over here.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.865
And what does Marcy do?

16:13.899 --> 16:16.968
She accidentally tears off
a piece of Nicole's labia.

16:17.003 --> 16:20.138
Majora, not minora.
But there's blood everywhere.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.307
The movie shuts down.

16:22.341 --> 16:23.975
Yeah, funny...

16:24.010 --> 16:25.710
Funny scene,
but what's the show?

16:25.745 --> 16:27.846
That is
a very good question, Roberta.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.983
To me, it's about the crazy shit
that women do to themselves

16:32.018 --> 16:33.485
in the name of men.

16:33.519 --> 16:37.922
It's about a smart,
successful, modern woman,

16:37.957 --> 16:39.858
looking for love in a city

16:39.892 --> 16:42.093
that does not place
a whole lot of value on it.

16:42.128 --> 16:44.195
And it's about pussy.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.031
It's about getting some,

16:46.065 --> 16:48.667
giving it away,
and keeping it clean.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.774
You know anything about
the history of the game, Hank?

16:55.808 --> 16:57.409
Precious little, Lloyd.

16:57.443 --> 16:59.010
Well,
it's not altogether clear,

16:59.045 --> 17:00.311
it's up for debate,

17:00.346 --> 17:03.181
but some historians claim
it dates back

17:03.215 --> 17:05.416
to the Roman game of Paganica,

17:05.451 --> 17:07.484
where, uh, participants
used a bent stick

17:07.520 --> 17:08.853
to hit a stuffed leather ball.

17:08.887 --> 17:11.289
Is that right?
That is fascinating.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.723
How do you work
for this fucking drone?

17:12.758 --> 17:14.693
He's my boss.

17:14.727 --> 17:16.895
Have you loved
every boss you've ever had?

17:16.929 --> 17:18.229
I don't know.
I never really had a boss.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.698
What are you talking about?

17:19.732 --> 17:21.132
To have a boss,
you kind of need to have a job,

17:21.166 --> 17:22.534
and I've never had one...
a job.

17:22.568 --> 17:24.368
I'm actually having sex

17:24.403 --> 17:26.271
with someone who's never been
gainfully employed?

17:26.305 --> 17:27.739
I know.
It's weird, right?

17:27.772 --> 17:29.808
What?

17:31.811 --> 17:33.211
Who callin' my phone?

17:33.245 --> 17:34.312
Silence!

17:34.346 --> 17:35.413
I'll call you back.

17:35.448 --> 17:37.215
Go ahead, Lloyd.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.088
Beautiful, Lloyd.

17:43.122 --> 17:45.123
- You're up, Abby.
- Yes. Ahem.

17:48.627 --> 17:49.761
Ohh.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.434
Hold on a second there, Abby.

17:56.469 --> 17:57.502
Let me show you something.

18:01.507 --> 18:04.776
- Just keep this arm straight.
- Mm-hmm.

18:04.810 --> 18:06.177
And use your hips.

18:06.212 --> 18:07.479
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:07.513 --> 18:08.947
Thank you, Lloyd.

18:09.982 --> 18:11.416
You dog, you.

18:12.785 --> 18:14.185
Good shot, Abby.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.987
I'm up.

18:16.021 --> 18:17.288
Doot-doot.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.129
Whoa, oh.

18:24.163 --> 18:26.131
Sorry.

18:31.971 --> 18:33.104
Oh!

18:33.139 --> 18:35.306
Okay, I get a hoolihan
on that one, right?

18:35.341 --> 18:36.775
That's a mulligan.

18:36.809 --> 18:38.977
Right, whatever.
I got that.

18:39.011 --> 18:40.678
Hang on a second, Hank.
Let me show you something.

18:43.549 --> 18:45.116
Keep your left arm straight,
come on.

18:46.652 --> 18:48.987
You're gonna need a little
astroglide back there, Lloyd.

18:49.021 --> 18:51.289
- I'm not that easy.
- And use your hips now.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.594
You're all over the place.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.600
Oh! Fuck me.

19:04.370 --> 19:06.337
Run, you cunt!

19:06.372 --> 19:08.306
No, no, no.

19:08.340 --> 19:09.307
Get there, get there.

19:09.341 --> 19:10.675
Hank, that's not funny.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.243
A little respect
for the game, please.

19:12.278 --> 19:14.379
Now, we're not
going to go anywhere

19:14.413 --> 19:16.481
until you drive that ball.

19:29.528 --> 19:30.528
Oh! Pulled it.

19:30.563 --> 19:32.163
Whee.

19:32.198 --> 19:33.398
Ahem.

19:38.938 --> 19:40.772
Great fucking meeting,

19:40.806 --> 19:42.407
and they bought it in the room,

19:42.441 --> 19:44.709
just like I said they would.

19:44.743 --> 19:46.144
I am so excited, Marcy.

19:46.178 --> 19:48.546
I knew you had a project in you

19:48.581 --> 19:49.814
just waiting to get out.

19:49.849 --> 19:51.716
Runkle, how come
you never saw this?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.318
I don't know, Stu.

19:53.352 --> 19:55.587
I guess I just missed it.

19:55.621 --> 19:58.089
Guess I missed a lot of things.

19:58.123 --> 20:00.024
Hey, you want come back
to my place,

20:00.059 --> 20:01.659
celebrate further?

20:01.694 --> 20:04.429
Sure.
Go get the car.

20:04.463 --> 20:06.431
Sorry I can't invite you,
Charlie,

20:06.465 --> 20:07.699
but that would be weird.

20:07.733 --> 20:09.601
I agree, Stu.

20:09.635 --> 20:11.836
Anyway, like I said,
I'm not interested

20:11.871 --> 20:13.571
in nuding up with you guys.

20:13.606 --> 20:16.207
Besides, Hank has fixed me up
on a blind date.

20:16.242 --> 20:18.076
She should be here any minute.

20:18.110 --> 20:21.512
Apparently, she's DTF.

20:21.547 --> 20:23.448
Love to hear that.

20:23.482 --> 20:25.383
Peace, bro.

20:29.655 --> 20:31.389
You really
saved my ass, Runkle.

20:31.423 --> 20:33.024
I did nothing of the sort.

20:33.058 --> 20:36.527
I just gave you
a little push, that's all.

20:36.562 --> 20:38.062
You did the rest.

20:40.165 --> 20:43.668
Okay.

20:43.702 --> 20:46.838
Well, have a good night.

20:46.872 --> 20:48.439
You too, Marce.

21:04.924 --> 21:07.091
Ah, you must be Charlie.

21:07.126 --> 21:09.761
And how would you know?

21:09.795 --> 21:11.963
Hank told me you were bald.

21:11.997 --> 21:14.232
Ha! Right.

21:14.266 --> 21:15.466
Of course, he did.

21:15.501 --> 21:18.937
He also said you fuck
like a champ.

21:18.971 --> 21:20.071
Nice to meet you.

21:20.105 --> 21:22.440
I'm number 21.

21:28.681 --> 21:30.248
Hey, you think I can
return these clubs

21:30.282 --> 21:34.185
to the pro shop
when I'm done today?

21:34.219 --> 21:36.721
Jesus, wow.
Mean face guy.

21:52.404 --> 21:54.172
Uh-oh.

21:54.206 --> 21:56.507
- Hey, come on.
- Come here!

21:56.542 --> 21:59.310
- Hank, Lloyd!
- I was raking!

21:59.345 --> 22:00.311
I was cleaning up.

22:00.346 --> 22:02.146
- Stop this!
- Come here!

22:02.181 --> 22:05.550
- You're acting like children.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:05.584 --> 22:07.518
- Come here!
- Ooh!

22:07.553 --> 22:09.587
Whoa!

22:09.621 --> 22:11.055
Oh, my God!

22:11.090 --> 22:13.358
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

22:13.392 --> 22:15.326
How dare your disrespect
the golf course!

22:15.361 --> 22:16.894
- Lloyd!
- Shut the fuck up!

22:16.929 --> 22:19.764
Lloyd Alan Phillips, Jr.!

22:19.798 --> 22:23.301
- Hank, I'm sorry.
- Gentlemen, please.

22:23.335 --> 22:25.236
I don't know what
came over me. I'm sorry.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.271
I do that sometimes.
I make people angry.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.706
But you know
what you're gonna do now?

22:28.741 --> 22:30.274
What?

22:30.309 --> 22:32.377
You're gonna give me
back to Abby.

22:32.411 --> 22:35.646
Yeah, because this right here?

22:35.681 --> 22:37.315
This is not a love connection.

22:37.349 --> 22:39.117
Oh. Most certainly
is not.

22:39.151 --> 22:40.785
But that sexy
little legal beagle...

22:40.819 --> 22:42.887
That is just what
the doctor ordered for me.

22:42.921 --> 22:44.222
Yeah, but my word is my bond,

22:44.256 --> 22:46.257
and I told Abby that
I would take good care of you.

22:46.291 --> 22:48.526
Believe it or not, she was
taking great care of me.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.961
In fact, I have never felt

22:49.995 --> 22:51.696
so well taken care of
by an attorney.

22:51.730 --> 22:53.765
- It was almost erotic.
- It's okay.

22:53.799 --> 22:57.101
I was feeling a little stressed,
a little overworked,

22:57.136 --> 22:59.003
but I learned from the best.

22:59.038 --> 23:00.705
Yeah, you
gotta be careful, Lloyd.

23:00.739 --> 23:02.507
You don't want to get another
one of those anal fissures.

23:02.541 --> 23:04.375
Oh, I most certainly do not.

23:04.410 --> 23:06.210
That was an awful time.
A terrible time.

23:06.245 --> 23:08.446
Like having two anuses.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.048
Do you have a picture?

23:10.082 --> 23:12.216
- Well, I do.
- Really?

23:12.251 --> 23:13.718
The doctor said I was
so special,

23:13.752 --> 23:15.219
I'm in all the books.

23:15.254 --> 23:16.387
Right on.

23:19.224 --> 23:20.391
No, that's your kid.

23:20.426 --> 23:22.060
Oh, there it is.
Right the fuck on.

23:22.094 --> 23:23.394
Yeah.

23:23.429 --> 23:25.696
Looks like a map
of the Western United States.

23:31.136 --> 23:32.537
Ohh.

23:32.571 --> 23:34.439
Fine, I'll
be your attorney again.

23:34.473 --> 23:35.773
Really? You will?

23:35.808 --> 23:38.009
This is good news.

23:38.043 --> 23:39.911
Yes. Unless I get you off,

23:39.945 --> 23:41.712
you'll be of no use to anyone,

23:41.747 --> 23:43.681
me, most importantly.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.951
Well, then I think you should
probably get me off then.

23:46.985 --> 23:48.119
Nope.

23:48.153 --> 23:49.720
- No more sex.
- What?

23:49.755 --> 23:51.823
No more sexytime?

23:51.857 --> 23:56.861
I mean, if I'm going to see
this through to the end,

23:56.895 --> 23:58.696
we can't have
a physical relationship.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.132
But we do have
a physical relationship.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.568
Not anymore, we don't.

24:03.602 --> 24:04.635
But...

24:04.670 --> 24:06.404
- But what?
- You got yours.

24:06.438 --> 24:07.972
I know.

24:08.006 --> 24:09.340
It was good too.

24:09.374 --> 24:11.709
I'm sorry, pal.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.377
Fine.
Be that way.

24:13.412 --> 24:16.147
Oh! You can
give it up that easily?

24:16.181 --> 24:17.548
I'm actually insulted.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.350
No, no, it's not gonna
be easy, trust me.

24:19.384 --> 24:20.651
I got a whole movie
playing in my head,

24:20.686 --> 24:21.986
and it's
pretty fucking arousing.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.688
Mmm.

24:23.722 --> 24:24.722
I know that movie.

24:24.756 --> 24:25.823
Yeah?

24:25.858 --> 24:27.992
- I love that movie.
- Starring you.

24:28.026 --> 24:30.495
I guess it's just gonna have
to keep us going, huh?

24:30.529 --> 24:31.562
I guess so.

24:31.597 --> 24:32.630
It'll be interesting.

24:32.664 --> 24:34.765
What'll be interesting?

24:34.800 --> 24:37.468
Well, there will come a day

24:37.503 --> 24:40.238
when all this horrid
legal strife is behind us.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.106
Oh, lord, I fucking hope so.

24:42.141 --> 24:46.410
And it'll be interesting
to, uh,

24:46.445 --> 24:49.580
see what you want then.

24:49.615 --> 24:51.149
You know what I mean?

24:51.183 --> 24:54.952
Yeah, I know what you mean.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.127
Hey, Ben.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.162
How are you, Hank?

25:38.197 --> 25:40.131
How are you this evening?

25:42.034 --> 25:44.835
You know, we never really got
off on the right foot, did we?

25:44.870 --> 25:46.704
No, we didn't.

25:46.738 --> 25:48.372
That's probably my fault.

25:48.407 --> 25:50.208
It's definitely your fault.

25:50.242 --> 25:51.442
Mm.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.881
Your kid is talented.

25:56.915 --> 25:58.849
So's yours.

26:00.252 --> 26:02.720
Well, we got that
in common, right?

26:02.754 --> 26:04.021
Yeah.

26:04.056 --> 26:06.857
And we seem to have
the same taste in women.

26:06.892 --> 26:09.727
You know, Hank,
I gotta be honest with you.

26:09.761 --> 26:11.796
It's not what you think it is.

26:11.830 --> 26:15.266
Not that I don't want it
to be what you think it is,

26:15.300 --> 26:17.468
it's just she's not...

26:17.502 --> 26:19.070
She's just not there yet.

26:19.104 --> 26:22.673
Okay, that's good to know.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.909
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop trying.

26:24.943 --> 26:26.410
I wouldn't expect you to.

26:26.445 --> 26:28.579
If you did,
you wouldn't deserve her.

26:30.182 --> 26:32.483
She sure is
something special all right.

26:32.517 --> 26:34.652
Amen.
