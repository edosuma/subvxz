00:00.586 --> 00:01.884
God, I hate flying.

00:01.952 --> 00:03.265
You know if this plane goes down,

00:03.320 --> 00:04.359
the headline is gonna read:

00:04.429 --> 00:07.085
"ChaseDreams Comma Others
Die in Plane Crash"?

00:07.158 --> 00:08.591
We are "Comma Others."

00:08.656 --> 00:10.076
Just need to see our pilots,

00:10.130 --> 00:12.920
and as long as they have salt
and pepper hair, I am good.

00:12.975 --> 00:14.775
- Why?
- Salt and pepper hair,

00:14.844 --> 00:17.579
it's experience,
it's knowledge, it's miles.

00:17.647 --> 00:20.047
My ideal pilot is John Slattery.

00:20.116 --> 00:21.714
This isn't even a real flight, okay?

00:21.779 --> 00:24.269
We're just gonna be circling
JFK for 90 minutes.

00:24.321 --> 00:26.954
Why couldn't Chase just
release his album in a club?

00:27.023 --> 00:29.657
Um, because any idiot can
release an album on land.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.826
Only truly bomb people do it in the air.

00:31.894 --> 00:34.695
Can we please not say "bomb"
and "air" right now?

00:34.764 --> 00:37.198
Look, this is gonna be fun, okay?

00:37.266 --> 00:38.665
And we're not gonna die.

00:38.735 --> 00:41.068
When I say Chase, you say Dreams!

00:41.137 --> 00:42.236
- Chase!
- Dreams!

00:42.304 --> 00:43.637
- Chase!
- Dreams!

00:45.428 --> 00:47.217
- Chase! Chase! Chase!
- Okay.

00:47.295 --> 00:48.776
We might die.

00:52.381 --> 00:55.082
Okay, welcome, everyone.

00:55.151 --> 00:56.350
And shut up.

00:56.418 --> 00:58.052
Love the excitement.

00:58.121 --> 00:59.619
Can't take the noise.

00:59.698 --> 01:03.464
Now, you're here because
you're Chase's biggest fans.

01:03.524 --> 01:05.058
And because your parents are rich.

01:05.126 --> 01:07.227
Is ChaseDreams really on the plane?

01:07.295 --> 01:09.095
Yes.

01:09.164 --> 01:10.764
And for your superfans,

01:10.832 --> 01:12.365
it's not just Chase on the plane,

01:12.433 --> 01:13.900
but the whole Dream family.

01:16.271 --> 01:17.436
I love you, Cary!

01:17.505 --> 01:19.405
I love you too.

01:19.474 --> 01:21.241
Okay, and remember,
once the music starts...

01:21.309 --> 01:26.212
Hey, Cary, your hair is
looking a lot less swooped.

01:26.281 --> 01:27.647
I know. Why didn't you tell me?

01:27.715 --> 01:29.482
I looked crazy.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.916
Well, I was trying to be supportive.

01:30.985 --> 01:32.718
Also it was really funny.

01:32.787 --> 01:34.820
You're the one that told me
to ride the wave.

01:34.889 --> 01:36.255
I told you to use Chase.

01:36.324 --> 01:37.856
Not become him.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.825
Now, once we reach 30,000 feet,

01:39.894 --> 01:43.596
we will be streaming live
on ChaseDreams.com.

01:43.665 --> 01:46.064
There are cameras all over the plane,

01:46.133 --> 01:47.866
except the bathrooms.

01:47.935 --> 01:50.736
Viewers will be able to watch
any camera at any time.

01:50.805 --> 01:54.774
So if you need to yawn, burp,
sneeze, fart,

01:54.842 --> 01:57.276
do it now and do it fast.

01:58.479 --> 02:00.112
Excellent.

02:00.181 --> 02:03.315
Oh, um, here's a random question.

02:03.383 --> 02:06.685
Lance. Just such an idiot.

02:06.753 --> 02:08.386
Right?

02:08.455 --> 02:10.322
Um, sure?

02:10.389 --> 02:14.793
But he's, you know,
he's kind of cool, as well.

02:14.861 --> 02:16.528
Oh, so you're getting back
together with him.

02:16.596 --> 02:18.095
- No!
- Yes.

02:18.164 --> 02:20.632
No. No. Never.

02:20.701 --> 02:22.801
I just... I think you should be
nicer to him.

02:22.869 --> 02:24.636
Okay, Brooke.

02:24.705 --> 02:26.170
God I wish I had seen those pilots.

02:26.239 --> 02:28.740
Hey, Car.
I know you're scared of flying,

02:28.809 --> 02:31.543
so I thought you might want to
hold Helen for a little bit.

02:31.611 --> 02:33.010
You brought a pig on the plane?

02:33.079 --> 02:34.678
It's a therapy pig. I got it for you.

02:34.747 --> 02:36.549
Look, she's very calming.

02:36.612 --> 02:38.249
Unless you hold her the wrong
way, and then she'll attack you

02:38.318 --> 02:39.783
in ways that you never thought
were possible.

02:39.853 --> 02:42.153
Um, no thank you.

02:42.222 --> 02:45.723
Okay. I was just trying to help.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.025
Okay, folks, we are ten minutes out

02:48.094 --> 02:50.194
from hearing Chase's new album.

02:51.364 --> 02:53.464
12 incredible songs.

02:53.532 --> 02:56.633
We are talking over 19 minutes of music.

02:56.702 --> 02:58.702
12? I thought he only had three songs.

02:58.771 --> 03:01.272
Uh-huh. And nine remixes.

03:02.441 --> 03:05.976
Hey, not to be a bummer, but, um...

03:06.044 --> 03:09.112
How are you doing with today?

03:09.181 --> 03:11.447
Oh, um,

03:11.516 --> 03:12.615
I'm okay.

03:12.684 --> 03:13.816
Sorry to bring it up.

03:13.886 --> 03:15.252
No. No, no. It's...

03:15.320 --> 03:17.487
It's good. I mean, it's been
almost a year

03:17.555 --> 03:18.521
and no one ever talks about Dad.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.223
Yeah, it sucks.

03:20.292 --> 03:21.925
I wonder if Chase's remembers
it's his birthday.

03:21.994 --> 03:24.494
I'm sure Mom does.
I hope she's doing okay.

03:24.562 --> 03:25.996
- Hi, guys!
- Oh, God.

03:26.064 --> 03:28.698
Hey, how, uh, how you doing with today?

03:28.767 --> 03:30.066
I'm great. I'm great.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.640
This is such a big day for Chasey.
And me.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.704
I'm wearing the first sample
from my jewelry line.

03:34.773 --> 03:35.914
Oh, you have a jewelry line now?

03:35.992 --> 03:37.546
Yeah, yeah. The book was such a hit

03:37.640 --> 03:39.208
that they're letting me move
into apparel now.

03:39.277 --> 03:40.580
This is just a prototype.

03:40.635 --> 03:42.945
The real version will be four
times bigger and heavier.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.947
Okay, I'm gonna go check on Chase.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.049
I'm wearing it on the
livestream to get feedback

03:47.118 --> 03:49.118
from the marketplace.

03:49.186 --> 03:52.388
Yeah, wow, you... You're doing a lot.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.627
Hey, kiddo.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.562
Just wanted to see how you're doing.

03:59.631 --> 04:00.830
Today.

04:00.899 --> 04:02.799
I guess I feel a little weird.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.266
Yeah, I figured.

04:04.335 --> 04:05.935
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Sure.

04:06.003 --> 04:07.736
They put a bunch of filler in my lips

04:07.805 --> 04:10.672
to make them look kissable,
and now I can't feel them.

04:12.342 --> 04:13.942
Oh.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.445
Okay, any last questions
before we go live?

04:16.512 --> 04:18.079
Yeah, where's my mom?

04:18.148 --> 04:20.682
Oh, right. She arrived not
very camera-ready,

04:20.750 --> 04:23.284
so Casandra will be your mom
for this flight.

04:23.353 --> 04:24.352
Hello.

04:24.421 --> 04:25.687
That's an upgrade.

04:26.690 --> 04:29.257
God, Chase doesn't remember either.

04:29.326 --> 04:31.493
Oh, my God, that is so sad.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.094
I have said it once
and I'll say it again, Cary.

04:33.163 --> 04:35.597
We are the only normal
emotionally stable people

04:35.666 --> 04:36.832
in this family.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.599
Oh, God!

04:38.668 --> 04:40.435
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

04:40.503 --> 04:42.270
Come on, that was not even that bad.

04:43.506 --> 04:45.173
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

04:45.241 --> 04:47.608
<i>It's your captains speaking,
Tiff and Amanda.</i>

04:47.677 --> 04:49.135
<i>Sorry about the turbulence,</i>

04:49.198 --> 04:51.912
<i>but from now on, we are
expecting such a smooth ride.</i>

04:51.982 --> 04:54.248
<i>So relax and enjoy the flight.</i>

04:54.317 --> 04:55.450
<i>Bye!</i>

04:55.518 --> 04:56.951
Mm, no.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.588
Our pilot's name is Tiff?

05:00.656 --> 05:02.656
Oh, what, a woman can't be a pilot?

05:02.725 --> 05:03.924
- Okay.
- Wow.

05:03.994 --> 05:05.593
Gay misogyny is real.

05:05.661 --> 05:07.996
No, a woman can be my pilot, all right?

05:08.064 --> 05:09.964
Meryl Streep can be my pilot.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.598
Viola Davis can be my pilot.

05:11.666 --> 05:13.812
You'd rather have
Viola Davis, the actress,

05:13.898 --> 05:15.835
than than two actual pilots?

05:15.904 --> 05:18.005
<i>Hey, guys. Sorry to bug.</i>

05:18.073 --> 05:21.241
<i>But we have now reached
cruising altitude.</i>

05:21.310 --> 05:23.843
<i>So feel free to unbuckle
and move about the cabin.</i>

05:23.912 --> 05:25.312
<i>Bye!</i>

05:25.381 --> 05:26.988
- I know you know what I mean.
- No.

05:27.074 --> 05:28.148
No, I don't.

05:28.217 --> 05:30.550
They said "bye" at the same time.

05:30.619 --> 05:32.352
I love women.

05:32.421 --> 05:33.953
I think all pilots should be women,

05:34.023 --> 05:35.955
and I think all flight
attendants should be...

05:36.025 --> 05:37.690
Yeah, well, we have to keep
the phones...

05:37.759 --> 05:39.359
- Oh, shit.
- What?

05:39.428 --> 05:41.328
This guy I used to sleep with
by the airport.

05:41.397 --> 05:44.197
Oh, my God, he's coming. He's coming.

05:49.293 --> 05:52.171
Okay, it's official.
We are streaming live!

05:52.240 --> 05:53.839
Say hi the world, guys!

05:53.908 --> 05:55.841
Hi!

05:55.910 --> 05:58.310
On behalf of ChaseDreams.com,

05:58.379 --> 06:01.313
<i>welcome to the release of
"Chase Manhattan,"</i>

06:01.382 --> 06:04.750
<i>featuring "Stink," the number
one song on iTunes</i>

06:04.818 --> 06:06.285
<i>for six weeks running.</i>

06:06.354 --> 06:09.522
And now the man behind the music,

06:09.590 --> 06:11.524
ChaseDreams!

06:18.632 --> 06:20.699
ChaseDreams!

06:25.505 --> 06:27.205
Okay, calm down.

06:27.274 --> 06:29.775
Okay, thank you guys so much
for being here.

06:29.843 --> 06:31.376
Today is a special day,
because it is the release

06:31.445 --> 06:34.012
of my first album I ever got to make.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.916
It's also special because today

06:37.985 --> 06:38.984
would have been my dad's birthday.

06:39.053 --> 06:40.518
Aww.

06:40.588 --> 06:42.754
He was the best, and I really miss him.

06:42.823 --> 06:44.590
He died of cancer.

06:44.658 --> 06:48.226
So in honor of him, I have a surprise.

06:48.295 --> 06:50.696
I'm gonna donate 10% of my album sales

06:50.764 --> 06:52.797
to the American Cancer Society!

06:56.335 --> 06:58.668
Oh, fuck.

07:01.145 --> 07:02.678
What are we doing?

07:02.746 --> 07:03.945
There are no cameras in here.

07:04.014 --> 07:05.814
I don't think there's any AC either.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.516
God, Cary, focus.

07:07.585 --> 07:09.552
Chase just told the whole world
that Dad died of cancer.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.720
Mom needs to tell him the truth
before someone else does.

07:11.789 --> 07:13.622
I know. You should talk to her.

07:13.691 --> 07:14.956
What? Why me?

07:15.025 --> 07:17.193
Because you're Chase's assistant now.

07:17.261 --> 07:18.694
So? I mean, you are way better at having

07:18.762 --> 07:20.196
difficult conversations with Mom.

07:20.264 --> 07:21.697
Remember when you told her you were gay?

07:21.765 --> 07:23.265
You told her I was gay.

07:23.334 --> 07:25.934
I mean, who can remember
who told what when?

07:26.003 --> 07:27.102
She found weed in your purse

07:27.171 --> 07:28.536
so you said "Cary's gay."

07:28.605 --> 07:30.238
That's right.

07:30.307 --> 07:32.074
Well, in that case, it's your turn.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.281
- Hey, Mom?
- Hey.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.482
Can I talk to you in
the bathroom for a sec?

07:41.551 --> 07:42.617
Sure.

07:44.988 --> 07:46.654
Okay, if you guys liked that song,

07:46.724 --> 07:48.056
you're gonna love this next one,

07:48.125 --> 07:50.458
'cause it's the same plus horns.

07:54.464 --> 07:55.997
How do people have sex in these things?

07:56.066 --> 07:58.100
- They're so small.
- Ooh, Mom, gross.

07:58.175 --> 07:59.534
How are you not freaking out right now?

07:59.559 --> 08:00.768
About what?

08:00.846 --> 08:03.263
Chase just made his entire
album about cancer,

08:03.332 --> 08:05.466
and he did not have a dad
that died of cancer.

08:05.535 --> 08:07.001
So? It's still nice.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.603
What are you saying,
you don't want your brother

08:08.671 --> 08:10.705
raising money for cancer?
That's pretty low, Cary.

08:10.773 --> 08:13.541
No, I don't want my little
brother labeled a liar.

08:13.610 --> 08:16.443
Well, no one knows the truth
except for our family.

08:16.513 --> 08:17.612
Well, and the hospital.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.046
And Lisa from down the street.

08:19.115 --> 08:20.481
She's the one who brought me
the blow-dryer.

08:20.550 --> 08:21.983
Oh, my God, Mom.

08:22.051 --> 08:23.117
But it's not online anywhere.

08:23.185 --> 08:25.185
Even his obituary said cancer,

08:25.254 --> 08:26.954
so this can just be like
our new family history.

08:27.023 --> 08:30.758
Mom, that's not fair to Chase.

08:30.827 --> 08:32.426
We'll deal with it later.

08:32.495 --> 08:34.294
I mean, he's only said "cancer" once.

08:34.363 --> 08:36.429
Okay, guys, I've got another surprise.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.432
This fall I'm going on tour,

08:38.501 --> 08:40.667
and 10% of the proceeds will also go

08:40.736 --> 08:42.535
to the American Cancer Society!

08:46.175 --> 08:47.941
Great idea, Chasey.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.877
You're doing it. You're fighting cancer.

08:50.946 --> 08:52.612
Hi, Shuli.

08:52.681 --> 08:54.714
Can I just talk to you in
the bathroom for a second?

08:59.088 --> 09:00.987
Listen, is there any way
we can tone down

09:01.057 --> 09:02.456
the whole cancer thing?

09:02.525 --> 09:04.858
Absolutely not. This is a PR goldmine.

09:04.927 --> 09:08.127
That's why we made sure every
kid on this plane has cancer.

09:08.196 --> 09:09.728
- They do?
- Wait, no, no, no.

09:09.797 --> 09:10.872
We ended up not doing that,

09:10.912 --> 09:13.068
because we didn't want them
coughing over the "music."

09:13.162 --> 09:15.201
It's just that it feels like
cancer's been done before.

09:15.270 --> 09:16.735
You know? And between you and me,

09:16.804 --> 09:18.271
I feel like if we were gonna
solve cancer,

09:18.339 --> 09:19.338
we really would've by now.

09:19.407 --> 09:20.773
Trust me, Brooke.

09:20.841 --> 09:21.907
By the end of this blitz,

09:21.976 --> 09:23.809
Chase will own cancer.

09:23.878 --> 09:26.446
Okay, it's just...

09:26.514 --> 09:28.448
It is really hard

09:28.516 --> 09:30.516
for me

09:30.585 --> 09:32.385
to hear "cancer."

09:32.454 --> 09:33.786
Oh, Brooke, I'm sorry.

09:33.854 --> 09:36.189
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, if you're gonna cry,

09:36.257 --> 09:37.890
let's get it on the livestream.

09:44.198 --> 09:46.065
Hey, hey, hey, Car.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.133
Can I talk to you in that
bathroom for a second?

09:48.202 --> 09:49.802
Sure, yeah.

09:49.870 --> 09:51.003
Is everything okay?

09:51.072 --> 09:52.204
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:52.272 --> 09:53.806
I just wanted to do one of these.

09:53.874 --> 09:56.875
So what are you guys talking
about in here?

09:56.944 --> 09:58.477
You making fun of me?

09:58.545 --> 10:00.045
What? No, no.

10:00.114 --> 10:01.847
We're just dealing with
a family issue, so...

10:01.916 --> 10:04.149
Oh, good. Then, come on,

10:04.218 --> 10:05.985
lay it on me, man.
What's... what's the issue?

10:06.053 --> 10:07.686
All right, because I consider
you guys family.

10:07.755 --> 10:09.321
You and Brooke are like
grandparents to me.

10:09.389 --> 10:10.355
That's very nice, but we're just gonna

10:10.424 --> 10:11.690
handle this internally.

10:11.759 --> 10:13.125
Okay, you know what I think might help?

10:13.193 --> 10:14.459
Helen.

10:14.528 --> 10:16.327
I don't want to hold your pig.

10:16.395 --> 10:18.062
Okay, well, can you? 'Cause
she's getting very heavy.

10:18.131 --> 10:20.662
Okay, guys, thanks to
everyone who bought tickets

10:20.740 --> 10:21.896
to the raffle.

10:21.966 --> 10:23.901
All the proceeds are going to...

10:23.970 --> 10:25.236
Say it with me now:

10:25.304 --> 10:28.172
The American Cancer Society!

10:30.543 --> 10:32.343
Now the first prize is sick.

10:32.411 --> 10:33.544
God, it's hot.

10:33.613 --> 10:36.014
Where is Cary?

10:36.082 --> 10:37.715
Oh. Oh, my God.

10:37.784 --> 10:39.517
Oh, hi.

10:39.585 --> 10:41.052
This is embarrassing.

10:41.121 --> 10:42.720
How are you?

10:42.789 --> 10:44.622
I'm great, ma'am.
Would you like a beverage?

10:44.691 --> 10:47.091
Ha ha! Very funny.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.660
Uh, so no beverage then, ma'am?

10:49.728 --> 10:52.729
Are you joking? It's me. It's Brooke.

10:54.432 --> 10:56.232
Have we met before?

10:56.301 --> 10:58.935
Yeah, we used to hang out.

10:59.004 --> 11:00.737
At the motel.

11:00.806 --> 11:02.338
By JFK.

11:02.407 --> 11:04.307
- I don't...
- I ate your butt.

11:04.376 --> 11:05.742
Oh, my God, sorry.

11:05.811 --> 11:07.544
<i>Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry.</i>

11:07.612 --> 11:09.412
Okay, guys, this next item is
a chance to be a part

11:09.481 --> 11:10.847
of my next music video,

11:10.916 --> 11:12.716
'cause I'll think of you as I film it.

11:16.055 --> 11:18.139
Mom?

11:18.209 --> 11:21.006
Hi, Mom! You're having fun!

11:21.053 --> 11:23.693
Can I talk to you in
the bathroom for a second?

11:25.297 --> 11:26.462
Mom, what are you doing out there?

11:26.531 --> 11:27.916
I thought Cary talked to you.

11:27.994 --> 11:29.010
Yeah, he did talk to me,
and we both decided

11:29.088 --> 11:30.393
we're not gonna tell Chase the truth.

11:30.463 --> 11:32.435
Ugh, Mom. I know that you lied to Chase

11:32.504 --> 11:34.504
to protect him, but you could
really hurt him.

11:34.573 --> 11:35.705
Well, if you two want him
to know so bad,

11:35.773 --> 11:36.839
then why don't you tell him?

11:36.908 --> 11:38.608
Because I'm not his mom, Mom.

11:38.677 --> 11:41.463
Even though I basically have
been for the last six months.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.635
Is it hot in here?

11:42.682 --> 11:44.380
Come on, don't change the subject.

11:44.449 --> 11:46.316
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

11:46.384 --> 11:47.883
We're not gonna tell Chase.

11:47.952 --> 11:49.719
And starting tomorrow,
my name's Roberta,

11:49.787 --> 11:52.622
you're Felicia, Cary's Dante,
Chase is Miguel,

11:52.691 --> 11:54.424
we move to South America, we start over.

11:54.492 --> 11:56.259
What? No!

11:56.328 --> 11:58.293
That is... no. God.

11:58.362 --> 12:00.039
Also, Felicia?

12:00.117 --> 12:01.375
<i>♪ My brother's gay ♪</i>

12:01.461 --> 12:03.632
- Yes, gay, very fun.
- <i>♪ And I'm here to say ♪</i>

12:03.701 --> 12:06.301
This song is about me. Yay.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.770
I love this. Hey, Shuli.

12:07.831 --> 12:09.063
Have you see Brooke?

12:09.125 --> 12:10.439
I think she's in the bathroom
with your mom.

12:10.507 --> 12:12.541
Thanks, cutie.

12:12.610 --> 12:15.477
So Chase is still going very
hard at the whole cancer thing.

12:15.546 --> 12:17.613
- Have you not told him?
- No, she hasn't.

12:17.681 --> 12:19.448
How about this? We crash the plane.

12:19.516 --> 12:21.483
- Mom.
- Not into a building, Cary.

12:21.552 --> 12:23.185
Into a field so only we die.

12:23.254 --> 12:24.854
- Mom, no.
- Well, I don't see you two

12:24.922 --> 12:25.955
pitching any ideas.

12:26.023 --> 12:28.090
God, why is it so hot in here?

12:28.159 --> 12:29.458
<i>Hi, you guys.</i>

12:29.526 --> 12:31.126
<i>Not sure if you noticed,</i>

12:31.194 --> 12:33.762
<i>but the AC has gone down, which sucks.</i>

12:33.830 --> 12:35.865
<i>We'll pass out some
extra water, but yeah.</i>

12:35.890 --> 12:37.242
<i>Sorry, guys!</i>

12:37.267 --> 12:39.023
I'm just saying if
John Slattery was our pilot,

12:39.101 --> 12:40.902
- there would be not an issue.
- No. No. The AC has nothing to do

12:40.971 --> 12:42.491
with them. That is the grounds crew,

12:42.546 --> 12:44.105
and they are probably all men.

12:44.174 --> 12:46.162
Okay, I've decided.
I'm not telling Chase.

12:46.217 --> 12:48.643
None of us are. That's my final answer.

12:48.711 --> 12:50.311
Why is this necklace so heavy?

12:50.380 --> 12:52.113
Remind me, they need to be
smaller when we sell it.

12:53.984 --> 12:56.789
Okay, guys, this next
question from the livestream

12:56.852 --> 13:00.172
comes from a window
manufacturer named Tad.

13:00.223 --> 13:03.057
Hey, listen, I tried to stay
out of this,

13:03.126 --> 13:04.492
but your family has a secret.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.126
And I know what it is.

13:06.195 --> 13:09.529
It's shameful, and it's embarrassing.

13:09.598 --> 13:11.431
But it's time you guys came clean.

13:13.735 --> 13:15.502
You all have diarrhea.

13:15.570 --> 13:17.004
- What?
- Yes.

13:17.072 --> 13:18.605
- That's our secret.
- Yeah.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.207
- I have diarrhea.
- Yes.

13:20.276 --> 13:21.842
I smelled it the second
you stepped on the plane.

13:21.911 --> 13:24.377
I've been smelling shit
this entire flight.

13:24.446 --> 13:25.692
Yeah, it has nothing to do

13:25.763 --> 13:26.966
with the pig you've been holding.

13:27.066 --> 13:29.325
No.

13:29.372 --> 13:32.186
Dream family, I just wanna
get your take on this.

13:32.254 --> 13:34.454
A couple people on
the live stream are saying

13:34.523 --> 13:37.308
that Chase's dad didn't die of cancer.

13:38.308 --> 13:39.878
Um...

13:43.231 --> 13:44.933
Damn it.

13:45.028 --> 13:47.301
Mom, we need to tell Chase now.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.123
Do you really want him to find
out from a livestream?

13:49.209 --> 13:51.109
It's probably those stupid nurses.

13:51.171 --> 13:53.237
Or Lisa's dumb fat son.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.291
Mom, we have to tell Shuli
and Streeter too.

13:55.323 --> 13:56.688
They need to do damage control.

13:56.745 --> 13:58.557
Oh, why is it so hot in here?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.041
<i>Dubeks? What's going on in there?</i>

14:00.119 --> 14:01.057
Nothing!

14:01.112 --> 14:02.698
<i>Give them a second; they have diarrhea.</i>

14:02.745 --> 14:03.971
<i>And they're all going together?</i>

14:04.034 --> 14:05.120
<i>- They're all going together.
- Okay, I'm outta here.</i>

14:05.167 --> 14:07.527
- Do you want me to go get Chase?
<i>- I need to use the bathroom!</i>

14:07.595 --> 14:08.799
Use the other one.

14:08.854 --> 14:11.073
<i>- It's full too!</i>
- Then kill yourself!

14:11.174 --> 14:12.257
<i>Helen, no!</i>

14:12.333 --> 14:13.832
- Mom, just tell him.
- I can't breathe in here.

14:13.901 --> 14:15.088
I can't breathe. I can't
breathe. I can't breathe!

14:15.175 --> 14:16.909
I gotta get out of here.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.007
No, Mom, can you come back in
this bathroom, please?

14:19.085 --> 14:20.225
No! I'm not going to.

14:20.249 --> 14:21.648
- It's just a play.
- No!

14:21.673 --> 14:22.667
- We have to talk about this.
- No!

14:22.692 --> 14:23.858
- Yes!
- No!

14:23.927 --> 14:25.560
- Mom!
- All right, fine! Fine!

14:25.628 --> 14:27.688
Everyone wants to know
the truth about my husband?

14:27.720 --> 14:29.122
Great. Here it is.

14:29.199 --> 14:30.907
He didn't die of cancer.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.540
He was a fucking alcoholic,

14:32.579 --> 14:34.321
and he froze to death on our roof.

14:34.347 --> 14:35.347
Mom, you...

14:35.371 --> 14:36.786
I wouldn't let him drink
in front of Chase,

14:36.811 --> 14:38.019
so he climbed up to the roof

14:38.044 --> 14:39.724
and he blacked out
and he froze to death.

14:39.771 --> 14:41.209
And I found him the next morning,

14:41.278 --> 14:42.344
and it was one of the worst
things I've ever seen

14:42.412 --> 14:43.872
- in my entire life.
- Mom.

14:43.958 --> 14:45.670
And since everyone is so desperate

14:45.704 --> 14:47.451
to know all the details
of our family's life,

14:47.498 --> 14:48.513
how about this?

14:48.576 --> 14:50.131
He peed himself too.

14:50.194 --> 14:51.879
And since he blacked out on his stomach,

14:51.957 --> 14:54.157
his dick froze to our roof.

14:54.262 --> 14:56.568
That's right, everybody. That's right!

14:56.618 --> 15:01.120
<i>My husband died with his dick
frozen to the roof.</i>

15:01.189 --> 15:03.022
And Lisa had to come over
with the blow-dryer

15:03.091 --> 15:05.291
and help me thaw it off and we
had to get an extension cord.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.226
So, there. It's all out in the...

15:07.295 --> 15:08.595
♪ Open ♪

15:08.664 --> 15:09.863
♪ Let's all have a laugh ♪

15:09.932 --> 15:11.498
♪ Let's all laugh at my ♪

15:11.567 --> 15:12.531
Dead husband!

15:12.641 --> 15:15.001
Mom, no one's laughing. It's okay.

15:15.070 --> 15:16.369
He was the only man I ever loved.

15:16.438 --> 15:19.339
I did not want him to be a fucking joke.

15:19.407 --> 15:22.041
Mom, nobody thinks that he's a joke.
No one. Okay?

15:22.110 --> 15:23.909
He was a good man. He was a great man.

15:23.978 --> 15:25.778
- I mean, not great.
- Cary.

15:25.847 --> 15:27.412
He was doing the best that he could.

15:27.482 --> 15:29.949
He was born at a certain time

15:30.017 --> 15:31.139
in a certain place,

15:31.217 --> 15:34.568
and the gay stuff was
very, very hard for him.

15:34.622 --> 15:38.824
But he was doing the best
that he could do.

15:38.893 --> 15:41.360
- Do you understand?
- I know. I know.

15:41.428 --> 15:43.696
And this is why I didn't want
Chase to know.

15:43.764 --> 15:46.499
You two have so many
shitty memories of him,

15:46.567 --> 15:48.968
and I just wanted Chase to have
something different.

15:49.036 --> 15:50.268
I know...

15:50.337 --> 15:51.756
We didn't know you were this sad.

15:51.819 --> 15:54.306
Yeah, we just thought that
you were writing books and...

15:54.375 --> 15:57.576
- Doing molly and stuff.
- Yeah, I know what you think.

15:57.645 --> 16:00.045
"Oh, there's Mom with her dumb
little book."

16:00.114 --> 16:01.913
- I hear you laughing.
- Well, that's what they do.

16:01.982 --> 16:03.448
You know, they laugh at people.

16:03.517 --> 16:05.117
They think we're all so dumb.

16:05.185 --> 16:06.451
Oh, my God. Shut up!

16:06.520 --> 16:08.120
You're not a part of this family.

16:08.188 --> 16:09.754
And there it is.

16:09.823 --> 16:11.223
She finally admits it.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.258
I would've said that months ago.

16:13.327 --> 16:15.127
I just, I spent the last
30 years of my life

16:15.195 --> 16:16.561
taking care of an alcoholic.

16:16.630 --> 16:18.563
Am I not allowed to have a little fun?

16:18.632 --> 16:21.233
- No, you are.
- You two come home for the holidays,

16:21.304 --> 16:22.743
you come home for the funeral,

16:22.836 --> 16:25.524
and you go back to New York
City to your big fancy life,

16:25.594 --> 16:27.235
and you leave me there.

16:27.941 --> 16:29.641
<i>You leave me there.</i>

16:31.512 --> 16:33.744
I'm sorry, Mom.

16:33.812 --> 16:35.579
We just want you to be happy.

16:35.648 --> 16:38.416
Yeah, I mean, we like it
when you write your books

16:38.484 --> 16:40.217
and make your necklaces.

16:40.286 --> 16:42.019
I hate this stupid necklace.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.255
It's so big and heavy.

16:44.323 --> 16:46.323
And why is there no AC in here?

16:46.392 --> 16:48.492
It's these stupid dumb bitch pilots.

16:48.561 --> 16:50.094
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

16:50.163 --> 16:51.595
<i>We're also watching the feeds up here</i>

16:51.664 --> 16:53.531
<i>and really feel for your family,</i>

16:53.599 --> 16:55.832
<i>but I think you know the AC
is not on us,</i>

16:55.901 --> 16:57.834
<i>and it's this kind of
girl-on-girl sexism</i>

16:57.903 --> 16:59.770
<i>that makes it harder for
women everywhere.</i>

16:59.838 --> 17:01.238
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

17:07.313 --> 17:09.046
I'm sorry, Chasey.

17:29.334 --> 17:31.702
This might be a bad time,
but I remember now.

17:31.770 --> 17:33.570
You did eat my butt.

17:33.639 --> 17:35.739
Oh, no, thank you.

17:35.808 --> 17:37.340
It's actually the perfect time.

17:37.409 --> 17:39.142
Oh.

17:39.211 --> 17:40.243
Okay.

17:43.447 --> 17:45.047
Hey.

17:45.116 --> 17:47.917
I think now might be
a good time for Helen.

17:49.286 --> 17:50.853
Yeah, fine.

17:58.696 --> 18:01.797
Hey, sorry we ruined
the livestream or...

18:01.866 --> 18:03.766
Yeah, sorry I yelled at you.

18:03.835 --> 18:04.957
No, it's okay.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.870
You know, I know you guys think
of me as a big joke.

18:07.939 --> 18:09.071
I see it.

18:09.140 --> 18:11.306
But to be honest, I know exactly

18:11.375 --> 18:13.843
where you guys are at
right now, I really do.

18:13.911 --> 18:16.512
My dad, uh,

18:16.580 --> 18:17.779
froze on a bench.

18:19.816 --> 18:22.183
- What's that?
- Yeah.

18:22.252 --> 18:23.352
I don't like to talk about it,

18:23.422 --> 18:25.820
but, um, my dad was an alcoholic too,

18:25.889 --> 18:29.490
and, uh, when I was 18, he...

18:29.559 --> 18:31.026
Went for a drink in the park

18:31.094 --> 18:33.427
and he fell asleep.

18:33.496 --> 18:36.931
And then he froze on a bench.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.900
Oh, my God.

18:38.969 --> 18:41.002
I mean, we had no idea.

18:42.072 --> 18:44.472
My... my dad froze too.

18:45.976 --> 18:47.809
It was before I was born.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.377
He drank all the time.

18:49.445 --> 18:54.915
And one night he went ice fishing

18:54.984 --> 18:56.617
and he froze.

18:56.686 --> 18:59.053
He was so cold.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.222
But anyway...

19:01.291 --> 19:02.690
Hey, hey, hey.

19:02.758 --> 19:04.225
You guys are not gonna believe this.

19:04.294 --> 19:06.126
People on the livestream
are all sharing stories

19:06.196 --> 19:07.562
about their dads freezing.

19:07.630 --> 19:09.297
Yeah, hundreds of people.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.366
The hashtag #mydadfroze
is trending across America.

19:12.435 --> 19:13.734
Well, mostly in the Midwest

19:13.803 --> 19:16.370
and specifically a Brainerd, Minnesota.

19:16.439 --> 19:17.905
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

19:17.973 --> 19:19.373
No, this is great.

19:19.442 --> 19:21.242
Everyone talks about cancer,

19:21.311 --> 19:23.377
but no one talks about alcohol abuse

19:23.446 --> 19:25.278
or dicks freezing to roofs.

19:25.347 --> 19:29.249
I mean, but your family has
brought both issues to light.

19:29.318 --> 19:31.719
Oh, I guess... I guess that's good.

19:31.787 --> 19:34.487
In, like, a weird sick way.

19:40.796 --> 19:44.431
Okay, so, Chase and I had a nice talk,

19:44.499 --> 19:47.500
and we decided that he's gonna
take a month off.

19:47.569 --> 19:50.570
No album press, no tours, nothing.

19:50.639 --> 19:52.940
And I don't care what anybody
says, I'm his mother,

19:53.008 --> 19:54.007
and I'm putting my foot down.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.493
- Okay.
- Great.

19:55.573 --> 19:57.606
- Yeah, I mean, definitely.
- Oh, my God.

19:57.652 --> 20:00.286
Okay, I just got the craziest email.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.903
They want Chase to perform at the VMAs!

20:05.120 --> 20:06.610
Wait, like, the actual VMAs?

20:06.665 --> 20:08.782
- Whoa, that's huge.
- I know.

20:08.852 --> 20:10.423
I mean, this is gonna change everything.

20:10.492 --> 20:13.960
- Well, when are they?
- Two weeks.

20:14.028 --> 20:15.695
Uh, okay, instead of a month,

20:15.764 --> 20:18.045
Chase will take two weeks off,
but no less.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.201
I totally hear you, but he needs

20:19.247 --> 20:20.547
to start rehearsals Thursday.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.766
Okay, he'll take five days off.

20:21.818 --> 20:23.185
And he has a fitting tomorrow.

20:23.246 --> 20:24.451
Okay, he'll go to bed early tonight.

20:24.521 --> 20:26.046
But I mean it, no screens. I'm serious.

20:26.108 --> 20:27.974
Straight to bed. Are you excited?

20:28.176 --> 20:29.876
- Yeah.
- I know, me too.

20:29.944 --> 20:31.877
Wait, what are the VMAs exactly?

20:34.146 --> 20:36.661
Oh, hey, so Brooke told me
about your dad.

20:36.763 --> 20:38.597
I'm so sorry, Streeter.

20:38.665 --> 20:40.168
- Oh, that was a lie.
- What?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.644
Yeah, my dad's alive.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.869
I just said he froze to help
you guys out.

20:43.937 --> 20:45.904
You know, turn a meltdown into
a movement.

20:45.973 --> 20:47.406
- Wow.
- Yeah.

20:47.475 --> 20:49.408
- Well, thank you.
- Eh.

20:49.477 --> 20:51.818
You are one smart man, Streeter.

20:51.888 --> 20:53.278
You know what, I am really smart.

20:53.347 --> 20:55.599
Also, I got you this Imodium
for your diarrhea.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.239
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

20:57.279 --> 20:58.927
<i>Yep, I am a very smart...</i>

20:58.998 --> 21:00.061
<i>Oh, Helen, no!</i>

21:00.124 --> 21:01.824
<i>So let me know what you
think, marketplace.</i>

21:01.892 --> 21:03.546
<i>It's also gonna come in a turquoise,</i>

21:03.593 --> 21:05.358
<i>and we got in chocolate brown.</i>

21:05.405 --> 21:07.972
<i>Also, we're thinking of
expanding it to fanny packs,</i>

21:08.041 --> 21:09.999
<i>but we call them "Fanny Pat's."</i>

21:10.077 --> 21:11.483
<i>Isn't that cute, marketplace?</i>

21:11.513 --> 21:12.678
<i>- Hey, Mom?
- Hey.</i>

21:12.731 --> 21:13.780
<i>Can I talk to you in the bathroom</i>

21:13.805 --> 21:14.725
<i>- for a sec?
- Sure.</i>

21:14.773 --> 21:17.734
- Like a...
- Yeah.

21:20.391 --> 21:22.025
Hey guys, this is the Other Show.

21:22.026 --> 21:23.976
- I'm Chris and this is?
- Sarah, hi.

21:24.022 --> 21:26.263
And we're here to talk
about episode nine which is

21:26.264 --> 21:28.598
- pretty dark, yeah.
- Jason drops his first album.

21:28.599 --> 21:30.367
Jason drops his first album.

21:30.368 --> 21:32.703
- It's the plain bottle episode.
- Yes.

21:32.704 --> 21:34.546
We're here with Drew and
Helene and Molly Shannon.

21:34.571 --> 21:36.940
- Whoo! Molly Shannon!
- Yeah.

21:36.941 --> 21:38.976
I know you get a full name at all times.

21:38.977 --> 21:40.610
You know if this plane goes down,

21:40.611 --> 21:41.640
the headline's gonna read,

21:41.665 --> 21:44.448
Chase Dreams comma others
die in plane crash.

21:44.449 --> 21:45.983
We are comma others.

21:45.984 --> 21:47.584
- Well, first of all...
- Yeah.

21:47.585 --> 21:49.052
If we were on a plane, it would say

21:49.053 --> 21:50.988
Molly Shannon comma
others die in plane crash.

21:51.824 --> 21:53.323
Without question.

21:53.324 --> 21:55.592
The example that we had
in the show that we cut

21:55.593 --> 21:59.296
was if Oprah and
Beyoncé, this is morbid,

21:59.297 --> 22:00.582
but were on the same
flight that crashed,

22:00.607 --> 22:01.899
- Jesus.
- Who would get top billing?

22:01.900 --> 22:03.233
I think Oprah.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.238
I think Oprah, too.

22:04.263 --> 22:07.201
But what if it was the day
after Formation came out?

22:07.226 --> 22:09.387
- Ooh.
- That's tough.

22:09.412 --> 22:10.920
Wait, somebody in the writer's room said

22:10.945 --> 22:12.012
that they would put out
two different editions

22:12.037 --> 22:13.887
- of the paper that day.
- Yeah.

22:13.912 --> 22:15.613
Like collector's editions
where you'd get to choose

22:15.638 --> 22:17.176
- whose your top billing.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:17.201 --> 22:19.082
Can Oprah die?

22:19.083 --> 22:20.811
- Oh.
- That's a good question.

22:20.836 --> 22:23.687
- Chase! Chase!
- Chase! Chase!

22:24.750 --> 22:26.290
So we shot this episode for four days,

22:26.291 --> 22:28.959
and we had a bunch of kids on the plane

22:28.960 --> 22:31.428
but not all kids could
come for all four days.

22:31.429 --> 22:33.330
They were only allowed to
I guess to legally work

22:33.331 --> 22:34.631
for two days, or something.

22:34.632 --> 22:37.167
So they hired only twins.

22:37.168 --> 22:38.806
- Only identical twins.
- So everybody on the plane

22:38.830 --> 22:40.304
is an identical twin,

22:40.305 --> 22:43.133
So in acts one and two, it's one twin

22:43.158 --> 22:45.208
and then in act three,
where you start screaming,

22:45.209 --> 22:46.376
it's their twin.

22:46.377 --> 22:47.878
Whoa.

22:47.879 --> 22:49.546
That's crazy cause we
got to there we were like,

22:49.547 --> 22:52.883
hi, like we knew them
and they were like, "hi".

22:52.884 --> 22:54.117
One twin is gonna be like, I don't know,

22:54.118 --> 22:55.385
it's like a fun party and the other one

22:55.386 --> 22:56.887
is gonna be like, are you sure?

22:56.888 --> 23:00.557
This woman was just screaming
about her husband's dick.

23:00.558 --> 23:02.559
Is this the same show?

23:02.560 --> 23:04.687
So you what I think might help?

23:04.712 --> 23:05.812
Helen.

23:05.837 --> 23:06.922
I don't want to hold your pig.

23:06.947 --> 23:09.109
Okay well can you, because
she's getting really heavy?

23:09.134 --> 23:11.868
As soon as I held Helen, it screamed.

23:11.869 --> 23:14.738
It could just tell I
had bad energy maybe.

23:14.739 --> 23:17.174
Ken was kind of like,
the Helen whisperer.

23:17.175 --> 23:18.344
- And Kate was like...
- Yeah.

23:18.369 --> 23:20.000
Putty in his hands and then the hand off

23:20.025 --> 23:22.100
would happen and the
screaming would begin.

23:23.197 --> 23:25.248
The pig was very happy,
very well taken care of.

23:25.249 --> 23:26.899
- Yes, it was.
- Yes of course.

23:26.924 --> 23:28.685
And the pig's owner was really nice.

23:28.686 --> 23:30.520
I got, I became very friendly with her.

23:30.521 --> 23:32.389
- Yeah.
- We texted one another.

23:32.390 --> 23:34.825
We had one experience
on SNL where we needed

23:34.826 --> 23:37.094
a squirrel, and this handler was like

23:37.095 --> 23:39.529
"Yes, I have a trained squirrel
and we'll bring it to you.

23:39.530 --> 23:40.680
"The squirrel does what I say.

23:40.705 --> 23:42.719
- "It will do whatever you need."
- And also, you really have to shoot at night

23:42.744 --> 23:45.016
because the squirrel is
driving down from the capital.

23:46.283 --> 23:48.005
So it was eight hours in a truck.

23:48.006 --> 23:50.707
Driven down, the squirrel
was put on its mark,

23:50.708 --> 23:52.442
the camera started rolling,

23:52.443 --> 23:53.901
the squirrel immediately just

23:53.925 --> 23:55.878
ran up into the rafters.

23:55.879 --> 23:58.048
And then the squirrel's
trainer was like,

23:58.049 --> 24:00.350
"We just have to wait
for it to come down."

24:01.552 --> 24:03.536
She was like, "What do we do?

24:03.561 --> 24:04.606
"What should we do?"

24:04.631 --> 24:07.224
We were like, "I don't
know what should we do?"

24:09.594 --> 24:11.094
They were sort of like,
"Well, you know with a squirrel,

24:11.095 --> 24:12.796
you know, you can train it,
but you also just like,

24:12.797 --> 24:13.731
you actually can't."

24:13.732 --> 24:15.604
You actually can't.

24:15.629 --> 24:17.276
It's a wild animal so
it's gonna do what it wants.

24:17.301 --> 24:18.735
You can train it, but on the other hand,

24:18.736 --> 24:21.097
you cannot train it.

24:21.122 --> 24:22.214
I'm not gonna tell Chase.

24:22.239 --> 24:23.940
And starting tomorrow,
my name's Roberta,

24:23.941 --> 24:25.642
you're Felicia, Carrie's Dante,

24:25.643 --> 24:27.811
Chase is Miguel, we
move to South America,

24:27.812 --> 24:29.246
- we start over.
- What?

24:29.247 --> 24:31.815
I think my favorite scenes to shoot

24:31.816 --> 24:33.784
were the scenes that we
went into the bathroom.

24:33.785 --> 24:36.320
So like watch Molly slowly disintegrate.

24:36.321 --> 24:37.621
Yeah.

24:37.622 --> 24:39.823
But we would do them
out of order and stuff

24:39.824 --> 24:42.618
- and you're so amazing in it...
- Yeah.

24:42.665 --> 24:44.995
And all of us falling
apart at different times.

24:44.996 --> 24:47.064
But like watching you sort of like

24:47.065 --> 24:49.666
have the veneer come
off is really awesome.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.535
That was a big chunk to memorize.

24:51.536 --> 24:53.670
And we were shooting,
you know, in New York,

24:53.671 --> 24:56.740
and I stayed at a...
I think it was a Hilton,

24:56.741 --> 24:58.175
to memorize my monologue.

24:58.176 --> 25:02.012
I went swimming and there
was like a glass like window,

25:02.013 --> 25:04.181
so there was a prom going
on while I was memorizing.

25:04.182 --> 25:06.016
So I was swimming, memorizing my lines,

25:06.017 --> 25:07.617
waiving to people like at a prom.

25:07.618 --> 25:08.761
For real?

25:08.786 --> 25:09.847
Dragging that scene.

25:09.872 --> 25:12.902
Molly Shannon is swimming
and screaming to herself?

25:12.927 --> 25:14.331
And I swam for so long 'cause there was

25:14.356 --> 25:15.759
so much to memorize that when I got out

25:15.760 --> 25:17.194
I had a charley horse, and I was like,

25:17.195 --> 25:21.075
I hope the prom people don't see me.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.856
I had to scoot up to the...

25:22.881 --> 25:24.167
That's going to be their prom story.

25:24.168 --> 25:25.369
They're gonna be like, at my prom

25:25.370 --> 25:27.037
I went to a dance and
I saw Molly Shannon

25:27.038 --> 25:30.357
coming out of a pool,
just like falling apart.

25:30.382 --> 25:31.771
So let's all have a laugh.

25:31.796 --> 25:34.211
Let's all laugh at my dead husband!

25:34.212 --> 25:36.380
Mom, no one's laughing. It's okay.

25:36.381 --> 25:38.115
He was the only man I ever loved.

25:38.116 --> 25:40.651
I did not want him to be a [bleep] joke.

25:40.652 --> 25:42.786
In the first episode,
it says I miss Dad,

25:42.787 --> 25:43.987
and we were like yeah,
and I know I did too.

25:43.988 --> 25:45.665
- But we didn't decide what that meant.
- Yeah.

25:45.690 --> 25:47.524
It's so it was like fun to
figure out in the room

25:47.548 --> 25:49.157
- what happened to him.
- Yeah.

25:49.182 --> 25:51.488
We also went back through,
kind of when we were

25:51.529 --> 25:53.630
towards the end, and
added the year of yes

25:53.631 --> 25:55.065
for a line for Pat's character.

25:55.066 --> 25:57.134
That was kind of like
a later in the game.

25:57.135 --> 25:59.295
Because we really liked
this idea that she...

25:59.320 --> 26:02.005
We've seen her existing
through this whole season

26:02.006 --> 26:04.341
kind of like repressing and making

26:04.342 --> 26:05.842
this new narrative for herself

26:05.843 --> 26:09.079
as like a gung ho woman going for it.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.248
And then in this episode
where she finally

26:11.249 --> 26:14.084
let's that go the side,
it's very satisfying

26:14.085 --> 26:16.219
to see that woman give it up.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.487
Yeah.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.189
I love the part where she's like

26:19.190 --> 26:21.224
where she just says,
explains why she didn't want

26:21.225 --> 26:22.592
to tell Chase that she's just like,

26:22.593 --> 26:24.361
I just want him to have a chance.

26:24.362 --> 26:26.496
- It's like so heartbreaking.
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.832
And then I just loved how
dignified she is with the way

26:28.833 --> 26:34.784
she sees him, how hard he
did try and so respectful.

26:34.830 --> 26:37.107
And I guess being an Irish Catholic

26:37.108 --> 26:40.610
with a long history of
alcoholics in my family

26:40.611 --> 26:43.363
I just felt like it was
just fucking beautiful.

26:43.388 --> 26:45.015
Yeah, I didn't want to give
a sheet or it to be a joke,

26:45.016 --> 26:46.616
- I didn't want like people to decide
- No.

26:46.617 --> 26:48.949
- ...who he was for him.
- A joke, that's horrible, yeah, no.

26:48.974 --> 26:52.756
It's also not so cut
and dry, any of this.

26:52.757 --> 26:56.526
That alcoholism and
anything is never just,

26:56.527 --> 27:00.097
he was a loser, he was a bad guy.

27:00.098 --> 27:01.111
It's never that cut and dry.

27:01.136 --> 27:03.800
So it's nice to tell
multi sides to that story.

27:03.801 --> 27:05.939
Exactly, yeah, multiple
sides to the story.

27:05.964 --> 27:08.960
I've never performed anything
like that in my life.

27:08.985 --> 27:10.414
I love it. I loved it.

27:10.439 --> 27:11.742
It was like...

27:12.305 --> 27:18.715
