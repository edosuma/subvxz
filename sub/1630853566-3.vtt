09:28.002 --> 09:29.830
We don't have that history.
I don't know him very well.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.528
And, um, it's been...

09:32.572 --> 09:34.008
the time that we've spent,
it's been under--

09:34.051 --> 09:35.575
uh, it's been under
tricky circumstances,

09:35.618 --> 09:39.230
so I got to find a way
to get through to him

09:39.274 --> 09:42.843
a-and connect, you know?

09:42.886 --> 09:44.888
Hey, do you remember Doritos 3D?

09:44.932 --> 09:48.152
Those things were just crazy.
They were nuts.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.980
ORGANIZM:
I don't think I was alive.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.374
KYLE: You weren't alive
for Doritos 3D?

09:52.417 --> 09:55.159
Cannot believe
you missed Doritos 3D.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.335
I mean, look,
they weren't amazing.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.076
They had potential,

09:59.120 --> 10:02.645
but they just didn't
quite take enough time

10:02.689 --> 10:05.953
to develop the chip
before putting it on the market.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.607
Does this sound familiar
to you at all?

10:07.650 --> 10:10.305
Does this track?

10:10.348 --> 10:12.829
You don't think I'm ready?

10:12.873 --> 10:14.352
KYLE:
Everyone has different needs,

10:14.396 --> 10:16.267
different styles, you know?

10:16.311 --> 10:19.836
But luckily for them,
I'm a chameleon of comfort.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.319
You just need a little bit more
time in the Doritos factory.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.190
You know what I mean?
Like Doritos 3D.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.409
If it were up to me?

10:27.452 --> 10:30.020
I'd send you down to Academy.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.283
Not because you're not great
right now,

10:32.327 --> 10:35.591
but because you could be
the best.

10:35.635 --> 10:40.901
I don't want the world to miss
out on what you could be.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.903
'Cause the world's already
been disappointed enough

10:42.946 --> 10:44.774
with Doritos 3D.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.907
Lord knows I am.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.474
I think about that stuff
on a daily basis.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.955
Yo, this one-- Hey, Cream.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.957
-This one's 250.
-250?

10:54.001 --> 10:55.785
You can afford that.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.831
All right, okay,
what's the car when people--

10:57.874 --> 10:59.833
when someone buys it
and they walk out,

10:59.876 --> 11:02.009
everyone's, like, wh--
like whispering to--

11:02.052 --> 11:03.619
everyone's like,
"That dude fucks"?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.055
-Like, "That guy's..."
-Like, he's the--

11:05.099 --> 11:06.709
-like, he's the boss.
-"He's the boss."

11:06.753 --> 11:08.537
-"He's the boss man."
-Do you have one of those?

11:09.494 --> 11:11.540
[dance music playing]

11:37.131 --> 11:39.046
Virgin!

11:39.089 --> 11:41.222

11:41.265 --> 11:43.354
Love it. Give me five minutes,
let you take it for a ride.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.355
-Thank you.
-Bro, check this one,

11:44.399 --> 11:45.617
check this one.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.184
"If Creamcheese
goes to FlyQuest,

11:47.228 --> 11:49.839
"everyone loses,
especially FlyQuest.

At this point, who would even
want Creamcheese?"

11:52.276 --> 11:55.715

11:55.758 --> 11:57.673

by the way, you'd l-- you would

11:57.717 --> 11:59.370

you would make them.

-I can't go to FlyQuest.
-You could, I'm telling you.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.199
No, I've been thinking about it.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.462
It just doesn't make sense.
It literally doesn't make sense.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.942
It's stupid. It's like...

12:07.988 --> 12:10.773
[stammers] It's too s--
It's thinking too small.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.775

I need to do something bigger.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.125
I need to win a championship,
honestly.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.519
I need to.
It's like... [stammers]

12:17.562 --> 12:20.174
But yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.784
What are you-- Are you gonna--
Are you putting something?

12:21.828 --> 12:22.959
Yeah, uh...

12:23.917 --> 12:25.701
Okay.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.660
"Who's ready
for an Axe Bros reunion?"

12:28.704 --> 12:31.533
-No... [chuckles]
-Right?

12:31.576 --> 12:33.840
-Yes. Yes, dude.
-Like, TSM! Creamcheese and TSM.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.319
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.800
And with Foresite?
It's like, obviously.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.020
That's how it was supposed
to be, me and Foresite

12:40.063 --> 12:41.499
winning a championship.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.892
-Axe Bros, bro.
-I didn't even think about that.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.894
Uh-- Five years later?
It's fucking incredible.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.591
-It's honestly amazing.
-I think... Well, 'cause I think

12:46.635 --> 12:48.332
what I-- what I was trying
to do, I figured, like,

12:48.376 --> 12:51.596
if you, if you went to FlyQuest,

12:51.640 --> 12:55.383
then I could also go to FlyQuest

12:55.426 --> 12:57.602
and I could be
your, um, ADC there

12:57.646 --> 13:00.780
at-- in-- at Fly--
uh, with FlyQuest.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.172
I mean, that would be amazing.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.696
Obviously.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.655
It's just...

13:06.698 --> 13:08.352
Like, I don't have
that much time left.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.354
You know what I mean?
And I need...

13:10.398 --> 13:12.835
to win a championship.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.578
And it's Foresite, right?

13:16.621 --> 13:18.232
-Yeah.
-Like, it's fucking Foresite.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.625
Yeah, that's true.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.714
-So...
-Yeah, you sh...

13:22.758 --> 13:24.151
I should do it, right?
I'm gonna do it.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.980
Well, yeah. Yeah.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.112
-All right. Done.
-Sent.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.853
-Done.
-Posted.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.116
-Boom.
-Axe Bros, bitch.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.779
JATT: In 2015,
the Axe Brothers bot lane

13:43.823 --> 13:46.477
was the most exciting duo
in the game.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.697
Axe Bros are a legendary
bot duo.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.003
PHREAK:
If you didn't know any better,

13:50.046 --> 13:51.352
you'd think the Axe Brothers

13:51.395 --> 13:52.875
were just, like,
some jerk-offs, whatever,

13:52.919 --> 13:54.398
but they were actually good.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.705
Everybody's always talking about
the Axe Brothers,

13:56.748 --> 14:00.578
but they forget that they
weren't the original bot lane.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.406
It was Kyle and Creamcheese.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.670
KYLE: Cream and I were actually
the O.G. dynamic duo.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.934
Even before we even dreamed

14:07.977 --> 14:09.457
of going pro.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.329
And we were good.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.244
APRIL:
They had that kind of chemistry

14:14.288 --> 14:16.681
that can only be forged
by knowing each other

14:16.725 --> 14:18.509
since middle school.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.556
Kyle might not brag about it,
but he was a sick AD Carry.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.602
Kyle's curse is that
he sees the game

14:24.646 --> 14:26.996
more clearly than everyone else.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.999
And back then,
he knew what the team needed.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.045
JATT:
The ADC is the most

14:32.088 --> 14:33.916
mechanically intensive role
in team fights,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.352
and he knew that Foresite
would be able to do that.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.832
He'd seen enough of him
team-fight,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.399
he'd seen him
auto-fill the AD Carry

14:38.442 --> 14:40.357
sometimes in solo queue,
and he pushed for it.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.359
So, I went to him, I said...

14:42.403 --> 14:43.926
"I want to switch positions."

14:43.970 --> 14:46.494
He wanted to go top
and have me switch to ADC.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.278
KYLE:
When Cream found out,

14:48.322 --> 14:50.977
he was like, "Oh,
what are you, tripping sack?"

14:51.020 --> 14:52.587
You know, you--
"Top f'ing blows.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.197
You want to go top? Top sucks."

14:54.241 --> 14:55.982
FORESITE:
It might surprise people now,

14:56.025 --> 14:57.592
but back then,

14:57.635 --> 14:59.768
playing ADC was the last thing
I wanted to do.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.423
APRIL: Then, one night,
they're playing late,

15:02.466 --> 15:04.294
it was, like, 3:00 a.m.,

15:04.338 --> 15:05.948
and Foresite
finally took the bait.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.646
[laughs]:
I still remember that game.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.735
That first time that I was
working with Cream...

15:10.779 --> 15:13.651
-Go, go, go, go.
-...and we got that first blood,

15:13.695 --> 15:16.611
-in bot lane...
-Oh, my God!

15:16.654 --> 15:19.744
Bro, that was
fucking disgusting.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.355
...yeah, the bot lane
just felt like home.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.271
When it actually happened,
like, it just clicked.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.925
Dude, you're fucking insane.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.535
You knew that was
the right call.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.797
And Foresite never looked back.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.973
Axe Bros were born that night.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.105
And I'm telling you,
I wouldn't be

15:32.148 --> 15:33.410
sitting here with six LCS titles

15:33.454 --> 15:35.195
with TSM

15:35.238 --> 15:38.546
if Braxton had not made
that call on that day.

15:38.589 --> 15:42.463
I guess you could say
I had foresight for Foresite.

15:42.506 --> 15:45.248
I don't think Braxton
gets enough credit

15:45.292 --> 15:48.338
for what he's done
for League of Legendshistory.

15:48.382 --> 15:51.559
By swapping roles,
Braxton effectively created

15:51.602 --> 15:54.040
the best player that
North America had ever seen,

15:54.083 --> 15:56.781
and he deserves
the credit for it.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.392
We could win both sides
of matchups.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.002
You give us any two Champs,

16:00.046 --> 16:01.221
we would absolutely crush.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.266
We could win every 2v2 matchup

16:03.310 --> 16:04.572
without any ganks.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.704
Two for one?
That's fucking good.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.880
-Nice.
-It was like watching, like, a,

16:08.924 --> 16:11.318
like, a child get into the ring
with, like, Floyd Mayweather.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.581
And Floyd Mayweather
didn't hold back,

16:13.624 --> 16:15.844
he was just, like, beating
the shit out of this kid.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.715

Oh, my God.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.152

16:20.675 --> 16:21.850

every single day,

16:27.203 --> 16:28.813

that he's been using my soap
and I confront him.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.036
And I say,
"Bro, are you using my Axe?"

16:34.080 --> 16:35.559
He's like, "What are you
talking about? That's my Axe."

16:35.603 --> 16:37.953
And I was like, "Oh, my God,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.869
have we been using the same soap
this whole time, dude?"

16:40.912 --> 16:43.785
And he was like,
"I swore to God I bought that.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.309
Like, I went to CVS,
I bought that Axe."

of trading for Creamcheese.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.758
TRAVIS: I mean, look,
on some levels, it makes sense.

18:27.802 --> 18:31.197
Foresite is now
a part-owner in TSM, and so,

18:31.240 --> 18:33.808
if he wants Cream,
he has the power to get it done.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.897
There was, like, a two-hour
period where LeagueTwitter

18:35.940 --> 18:37.638
was just going nuts,

18:37.681 --> 18:39.335
acting like it was a done deal.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.250
"Axe Bros are back."
"Axe Bros are back."

18:41.294 --> 18:43.122
And I was-- I believed it.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.646
I thought they were coming back.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.648
Until they weren't.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.519
So Foresite responds

18:49.563 --> 18:52.043
to Creamcheese's tweet
with one word.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.437
"Pass."

18:54.481 --> 18:55.438
CHRIS:
I thought it was a joke.

18:55.482 --> 18:56.961
I thought he was joking.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.615
I was like,
"These guys are best friends."

18:58.659 --> 19:01.183
That's a funny joke.
"Pass. Just kidding."

19:01.227 --> 19:05.013
But he wasn't kidding.
And that was cold.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.580
It's embarrassing,
that-that Cream

19:06.623 --> 19:08.364
is fawning all over Foresite.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.801
The-the fact that--
t-the delusion

19:10.845 --> 19:12.977
that he wants anything
to do with you.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.762
He's not interested.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.503
It's embarrassing. Go home.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.592
[chuckles]
Y-Yeah-- In retrospect,

19:18.635 --> 19:20.594
it was probably a little harsh.

19:20.637 --> 19:24.337
But I wanted to make it
really short and concise.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.687
Uh, just to show loyalty

19:26.730 --> 19:28.515
to my current team,
my current roster,

19:28.558 --> 19:32.083
which I think is one of the best
rosters we've had in years.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.085
Would TSM have traded for me?
They would've--

19:34.129 --> 19:35.957
Of course they
would've traded for me.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.785
Of course.
But they're not gonna b--

19:37.828 --> 19:40.353
They're just, it doesn't, it...
I'm too expensive.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.007
I am a top-shelf player.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.183
-Here's your keys.
-Thank you.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.706
You're gonna feel
so much better.

19:45.749 --> 19:46.881
I want to welcome you
to the Porsche family.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.362
I bought a Porsche. Yeah-- So...

19:52.147 --> 19:53.496
Doesn't bother me.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.063
[phone ringing]

19:55.106 --> 19:56.978
So, do we think this
is a tomato or an apple?

19:57.021 --> 19:59.372
-I think that's a bell pepper.
-CREAMCHEESE: Hey.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.911
Um, okay, yeah.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.304
Yeah, I'm actually--
I'll-- I'm actually

20:18.347 --> 20:19.522
swinging in
to Taco Bell right now,

20:19.566 --> 20:21.045
so don't worry about the food.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.569
Or...

20:22.612 --> 20:24.614
Um, but I'll come over
afterwards.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.839
Wow.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.842
-Do you like it?
-It-it really is cool.

20:34.885 --> 20:39.063
It goes, like, um, zero to 60
in a second or something.

20:39.107 --> 20:42.023
Yeah, well,
don't give Kyle any ideas.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.546
Kyle couldn't pull this off.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.505
It really is pretty.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.028
You happy?

20:47.071 --> 20:48.421
Yeah, I love it.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.857
Where is Kyle, also?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.163
-Is he...
-He's putting Irelia to bed.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.775
When do they start, like,
putting themselves to bed?

20:54.818 --> 20:56.559
Is-- They still--
She still has to do that?

20:56.603 --> 20:59.040
It-it takes a while. It takes
more than a couple years.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.042
This place is so nice.
You guys...

21:01.085 --> 21:03.087
-Yeah? Thank you.
-You guys are like full adults.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.306
[April chuckles]

21:04.350 --> 21:05.916
It smells good, too.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.875
Amazing what you can do
when four dudes

21:07.918 --> 21:09.616
take their collective farts
elsewhere.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.357
I kind of miss the old smell.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.794
Yeah. Me, too.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.448
Uh, you want something to drink?

21:15.491 --> 21:17.972
Yeah, I'll just have a Car Bomb.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.669
APRIL:
So, Cream's showing me

21:19.713 --> 21:21.541
this gorgeous new Porsche
that he just got

21:21.584 --> 21:24.239
to show the world
how well he's doing,

21:24.283 --> 21:26.720
but, you know, all it did
was make me realize

21:26.763 --> 21:30.593
that he's just as tortured
as the rest of us.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.945
Ugh, today was fucked, dude.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.947
You probably had
an awful day, too.

21:36.991 --> 21:40.124
Yeah-- Well, except for,
I bought the Porsche.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.735
There is good news, though.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.171
Part of the reason
it was so busy today,

21:43.214 --> 21:44.912
like, every team
wants the Cream.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.740
FlyQuest is thirsty.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.090
That's what I've heard.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.397
I mea-- I'll be real
with you, though, like...

21:51.440 --> 21:54.487
it would mean
a rebuild for Fugitive.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.662
-Mm-hmm.
-And you know, like,

21:55.705 --> 21:57.403
Kyle would never say this,

21:57.446 --> 22:01.102
but we both know that he would
never survive a rebuild.

22:01.145 --> 22:04.366
Not as long as Nathan's
in the picture.

22:04.410 --> 22:08.022
I know that what Kyle wants
for you more than anything

22:08.065 --> 22:10.590
is to win a championship.

22:10.633 --> 22:13.070
If you think that
there's a chance of winning it

22:13.114 --> 22:15.246
with Fugitive, isn't that
what you actually want?

22:15.290 --> 22:18.206
Yeah, n-- obviously,
that's what I want.

22:18.249 --> 22:21.383
Like, I-I love Fugitive.
That's my team.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.211
All right, all right, all right.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.561
-CREAMCHEESE: It's not that...
-I don't want to talk shop.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.824
I just want to give the guy
that got a Porsche a hug.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.262
It has a whole panel
where you can kind of, like,

22:31.306 --> 22:33.482
direct where the A.C. goes,
so if you want it

22:33.526 --> 22:35.136
-blowing just...
-What do you mean?

22:35.179 --> 22:36.572
Imagine you want A.C.
just blowing on your ears.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.400
Do you want to just go
and show him now?

22:38.444 --> 22:40.489
-I know that's what you want.
-Do you want to look at it?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.012
-You have it?
-What do you want to drink?

22:42.056 --> 22:43.579
-Yeah. Don't touch it.
-Where's your Prius?

22:43.623 --> 22:45.276
-Can I just have a Heineken?
-Did you trade it?

22:45.320 --> 22:46.887
-Did you trade it in?
-I fucking burned the Prius.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.760
ORGANIZM:
Can I ask you something?

22:50.804 --> 22:52.588
EMMA:
Yeah. What's up?

22:52.632 --> 22:54.590
ORGANIZM: Do you think
I should go to Academy?

22:54.634 --> 22:57.463
Well-- What?

22:57.506 --> 22:59.769
Braxton thinks
I should go to Academy.

22:59.813 --> 23:03.991
He said it's gonna make me
a better communicator.

23:04.034 --> 23:06.341
When did he say that?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.430
On the way here.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.172
How do you feel about that?

23:11.215 --> 23:13.827
I don't want to go
to Academy, but...

23:13.870 --> 23:16.917
I want to do what's gonna
make me the best.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.661
CREAMCHEESE: It's so crazy
to look at this and how--

23:21.704 --> 23:24.054
I-I had no idea
I was gonna own a Porsche.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.969
KYLE: I could get a Porsche.
You know that.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.449
-APRIL: No, you could not.
-You could not get a Porsche.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
I'm not going to get a Porsche.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.539
-You couldn't...
-APRIL: No, you're not.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.193
Eh, I wanted to show you
something here. Let's see.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.716
You guys want
to watch something?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.631
I completely forgot
you did this DVD thing.

23:35.675 --> 23:38.504
-It's weird. It's creepy.
-Yeah, I make DVDs. It's fine.

23:38.547 --> 23:41.332
I just like the tradition of...
you know...

23:41.376 --> 23:43.160
-Tradition from the '90s...
-...doing that.

23:43.204 --> 23:46.163
-...which ended in the 2000s.
-[April laughs]

23:46.207 --> 23:49.297
KYLE: Oh, like, for-- Look.
The Dignitas 2017?

23:49.340 --> 23:51.691
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, here, look.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.215
Here's your, uh, Baron steal
against Echo Flux.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.173
-You have my Baron steal?
-[shushes]

23:56.217 --> 23:58.132
-I'm sick in this.
-Sleeping.

23:58.175 --> 24:01.222
I've watched this, like,
a thousand times on YouTube.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.746
But I bet it looks great on DVD.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.705
Here's one you haven't
seen on YouTube.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.493
-Your wedding video?
-Mm-hmm.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.582
-I'm smurfing in this one.
-[laughs]

24:13.626 --> 24:15.454
I really am.
My speech was so fucking good.

24:15.497 --> 24:16.977
Can we watch this?

24:17.020 --> 24:19.109
Yeah, let's watch you smurf
our wedding.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.807
[April laughs]

24:20.850 --> 24:22.199
-CREAMCHEESE: I'm just saying.
-You killed everybody

24:22.243 --> 24:24.288
at our wedding,
yeah, it was brutal.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.335
-Those were the days.
-[sighs]

24:27.378 --> 24:31.078
I'm Creamcheese. I think a lot
of you know me as Creamcheese.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.428
But before I was Creamcheese,
I was NutMilk.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.737
And before I was NutMilk,
I was Trevor.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.653
And while I was Trevor,
I was Kyle's friend.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.742
The only other marriage
I really know about

24:42.785 --> 24:45.527
is the one
between Lucian and Senna.

24:45.571 --> 24:49.444
And although neither of you
wields a relic stone cannon,

24:49.488 --> 24:52.360
I think it's a pretty
good comparison

24:52.403 --> 24:54.231
-to a healthy relationship.
-[soft laughter]

24:54.275 --> 24:57.060
[laughs]

24:57.104 --> 24:58.671
Braxton and April...

24:58.714 --> 25:01.848
and to a lesser extent,
their daughter,

25:01.891 --> 25:05.765
are-are really close
friends of mine.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.768
A-And... I love them, you know?

25:08.811 --> 25:12.467
They're my family, to be honest.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.122
When Senna's soul was released,

25:15.165 --> 25:18.908
and she aimed her gun right
at Lucian, he didn't flinch.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.520
'Cause somehow he knew
that she was really shooting

25:21.563 --> 25:23.826
the monster behind him.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.567
He trusted her.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.004
Marriage is-isn't about
one person carrying...

25:29.963 --> 25:31.921
...or the other person carrying.

25:31.965 --> 25:34.663
[crying]: It's about you guys
carrying each other.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.754
And when you can't
carry each other...

25:40.756 --> 25:42.932
...I'm gonna be there
to carry both of you.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.024
I-I'm really--
I love you guys so much.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.809
Thank you.

What are you guys doing?

25:56.990 --> 26:00.123
Braxton wants Organizm
to go to Academy.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.082
-What?
-Yeah.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.736
NATHAN [laughs]:
No, dude.

26:03.779 --> 26:04.824
EMMA:
He just thinks that Organizm

26:04.867 --> 26:05.999
needs to communicate more.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.653
NATHAN:
Communication?

26:07.696 --> 26:11.134
They need to learn
how to communicate with you.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.267
No-Nobody's gonna
tell you what to do.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.312
I'm the owner. You know?

26:15.356 --> 26:17.488
So if there's an issue,
you just tell me,

26:17.532 --> 26:19.752
and I say, "Okay, nah--
we're not doing that.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.841
[scoffs]
"Okay, Kyle Braxton?

26:21.884 --> 26:23.494

you know? I don't care.

You know, that speech meant
everything to me.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.286
You've always been there for me.
For us.

26:32.329 --> 26:36.464
And I don't care what Resnick
says or what BS he throws us,

26:36.507 --> 26:39.641
we'll always be there
for you, no matter what.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.077
NATHAN:
I believe in you.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.644
Everybody believes in you.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.298
Forget about Cream for a second.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.474
If he wants to walk,
that's-that's fine.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.128
He knows where the door is.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.086
You're the future
of this whole team, dude.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.045
I'm putting everything in you,
and I'm not saying that

26:52.088 --> 26:53.481
to put pressure on you,
I'm saying that

26:53.524 --> 26:55.918
because I need you
to believe it.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.965
is a weak move.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.665
But I don't care.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.319
I actually think...
I actually think

27:49.363 --> 27:51.887
that's the strongest move
a person can make.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.455
[whoops]
Fuck yeah.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.239
A lot of players

27:56.283 --> 28:01.854
would be afraid of how
embarrassing that might look.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.116
-Welcome back.
-CREAMCHEESE: Thanks, guys.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.553
-To Creamcheese.
-Cheers.

28:05.596 --> 28:09.775
But me?
I'm not afraid of anything.
