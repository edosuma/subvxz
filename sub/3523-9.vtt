boatyard in 15 minutes.

01:45.789 --> 01:48.291
No, i got a meeting,

02:21.825 --> 02:24.327
O. J. Simpson's acquittal
they still cannot accept,

02:24.828 --> 02:27.330
and now they're suing
him in civil court.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.832
Simpson's attorney
is outraged,

02:29.332 --> 02:30.834
fred goldman
is philosophical.

02:30.834 --> 02:33.336
In jersey, they'd have
fried his worthless ass.

02:33.336 --> 02:35.839
Well, he's shunned
on his golf course now.

02:36.339 --> 02:37.340
Oh!

02:37.340 --> 02:39.843
There he is,
f. Lee fatfuck.

02:39.843 --> 02:41.845

02:41.845 --> 02:43.847

02:50.854 --> 02:52.355
Your uncle's
quaking in his boots
i was there to pop him.

02:52.856 --> 02:54.858
Ho, wait till we
get outside, huh?

02:54.858 --> 02:56.860
Junior's looking
for a way out.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.862
But, he's
got that iron
rod up his ass.

02:58.862 --> 03:00.864
He thought he
was in line
to be boss.

03:00.864 --> 03:03.366
Now he's gotta
take orders
from somebody

03:03.366 --> 03:04.868
who used to
fetch him
his sambuca.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.870
Hey, fuck him.

03:06.870 --> 03:08.371
Is he gonna sit
down or not?

03:08.872 --> 03:10.373
If tony
will guarantee
his safety.

03:10.874 --> 03:12.876
You deal with it
, alright, tony?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.382

go on that fuckin' cruise.

03:19.382 --> 03:21.384
No sooner do i get
back from florida

03:21.384 --> 03:24.387
than ange has
booked a suite on
the dawn princess.

03:24.387 --> 03:27.390
5, 000 bucks a week
and no way off.

03:27.390 --> 03:28.892
Thank god carm

03:28.892 --> 03:31.895
We're staying home thi
s year so jackie can
study for his sats.

03:31.895 --> 03:33.897
Ro found him a
great tutor.

03:33.897 --> 03:34.898
Pray he goes to
a state school.

03:35.398 --> 03:36.900
You oughta see terri's
bills from villanova.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.902
And matt and kevin

03:38.902 --> 03:40.403

03:40.403 --> 03:41.905

i'm sayin'?

03:41.905 --> 03:43.907
Don't be moving that
"h" no more, puss.

03:43.907 --> 03:45.408
It's too risky.

03:50.914 --> 03:53.416
I always wanted a
house by the ocean.

03:53.416 --> 03:54.918
Maybe in another life.

04:00.423 --> 04:01.424
Ton'!

04:01.424 --> 04:02.926
Tony?

04:04.427 --> 04:05.929
Hey, paulie.

04:05.929 --> 04:07.430
We gonna go
see your boat?

04:09.933 --> 04:12.435
Nah, i'm just...

04:12.435 --> 04:15.438
thinking about
our former friend.

04:15.438 --> 04:16.439
Who?

04:19.942 --> 04:21.444
Him?

04:21.945 --> 04:22.946
Not me,

04:23.446 --> 04:24.948
never.

04:24.948 --> 04:27.951
Me and jackie
met him down here in'95,

04:27.951 --> 04:29.953
when he go
t back from boca.

04:30.453 --> 04:32.455
Oh, yeah, that crazy
shit with your uncle.

04:32.455 --> 04:33.957
Junior hijacked
jackie's truck.

04:33.957 --> 04:35.458
What about it?

04:35.458 --> 04:36.960
I should've seen it
then, that's all.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.462
Don't waste another second
on that rat fuck, ton'.

04:39.462 --> 04:41.965
I'd kill him
again if i could.

04:43.967 --> 04:45.969
Tommy angeletti,

04:46.469 --> 04:48.471
he's doing a re- bar
at the esplanade.

04:48.471 --> 04:49.973
Yeah?

04:49.973 --> 04:52.976
He's into me
for 100 large on
college basketball.

04:52.976 --> 04:55.979
Now ralphie's holding
up the contractor
for more money.

04:55.979 --> 04:58.982
He's got the site
shutdown on a strike.

04:58.982 --> 05:01.985
Angeletti
can't work.

05:01.985 --> 05:04.487
Paulie, your
fuckin' book

05:04.487 --> 05:07.490
against millions gonna
roll in off the esplanade?

05:07.490 --> 05:09.492
I figured you'd
take his side.

05:09.492 --> 05:10.994
But, ralphie
shouldn't come across

05:10.994 --> 05:12.996
with a couple
of no- show
electrician jobs?

05:13.496 --> 05:15.498
I shouldn't get
something outta this
fuckin' esplanade?

05:18.001 --> 05:20.003
Alright, i'll
talk to him.

06:06.049 --> 06:08.551
Oh, go
od, you're up.

06:08.551 --> 06:10.553
I just got the digital
video for meadow.

06:10.553 --> 06:12.555
It's three down,
three to go.

06:12.555 --> 06:15.558
Plus, the scooter is
ready, but you're gonn
a have to pick it up.

06:15.558 --> 06:17.060
It's on my list.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.062
You're not gonna like this
next bit of news, either.

06:19.062 --> 06:21.564
Janice is insisting on cooking
christmas dinner this year.

06:21.564 --> 06:23.066
Christmas eve or
christmas day?

06:23.066 --> 06:24.567
I'm doing
christmas eve.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.069
You wanna turn her
loose on shellfish?

06:26.069 --> 06:28.571
She's determined to co
ok goose on christmas day.

06:28.571 --> 06:30.073
Why?

06:30.073 --> 06:31.574
Well, her impulses are rig
she's over here all the time.

06:32.075 --> 06:34.077
She volunteered me to make
the gravy and the lasagna,

06:34.577 --> 06:36.079
so, with everything else
i gotta do today,

06:36.079 --> 06:37.580
i gotta bring half
my kitchen over there,

06:37.580 --> 06:40.583
and she needs you
because the fuse b
ox is on the fritz again.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.085
Oh, fuck,
come on, i'm busy.

06:42.085 --> 06:43.086
What, i'm not?

06:49.592 --> 06:51.594
Well, i was
feeling good,

06:51.594 --> 06:54.597
all of a sudden, i'm
back to square one.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.099
What do you mean?

06:56.099 --> 06:59.102
I had another one of
those attacks this morning.

07:02.605 --> 07:04.607
Not the whole thing,

07:04.607 --> 07:06.609
but, it was right there,

07:06.609 --> 07:09.112
under the surface,

07:09.112 --> 07:12.615
that feeling like i go
t ginger ale in my brain.

07:12.615 --> 07:14.617
Are you taking
your medication?

07:15.618 --> 07:17.620
Not every day.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.123
Is that what the
prescription says?

07:20.123 --> 07:22.125
Another thing
to feel bad about.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.126
Well?

07:23.626 --> 07:26.629
Can you tell me
what led up to this?

07:26.629 --> 07:28.131
You know my log,

07:28.131 --> 07:30.133
i was supposed to write
everything down for you?

07:30.133 --> 07:33.136
Look, it's just a
list of shit i gotta
do for christmas.

07:33.136 --> 07:35.138
All the pressure
we put on ourselves

07:35.138 --> 07:38.641
this time of the year.

07:38.641 --> 07:41.144
I call it
"stressmas".

07:41.144 --> 07:43.146
That's cute.

07:44.647 --> 07:47.650
I was looking forwar
d to christmas this year.

07:47.650 --> 07:48.651
No shit.

07:49.152 --> 07:51.654
Now, here i go, right back
in the fuckin' rabbit hole.

07:53.656 --> 07:56.159
Okay, let's do
the drill.

07:56.659 --> 07:58.661
The attack,
what preceded it?

07:59.162 --> 08:00.663
Yesterday i we
nt down to the shore

08:00.663 --> 08:02.165
to get my boat
winterized.

08:02.165 --> 08:03.666
What happened?

08:06.669 --> 08:09.172
I started thinking
about this thing

08:09.172 --> 08:10.673
that happened
years ago.

08:10.673 --> 08:13.176
I haven't thought about
it since it happened.

08:13.676 --> 08:14.677
Tell me about it.

08:16.679 --> 08:18.681
I can't.

08:18.681 --> 08:19.682
I see.

08:20.183 --> 08:22.185
We're at one of our
favorite junctures.

08:26.689 --> 08:28.691
Without going
into specifics...

08:34.197 --> 08:36.698
i can tell you it was
a friend of mine.

08:38.201 --> 08:40.703
I found out he was working
for the federal government.

08:43.706 --> 08:45.708
Enough said?

08:45.708 --> 08:47.710
I see.

08:50.713 --> 08:53.216
Am i ruining
your christmas?

08:58.721 --> 09:00.223
A- major?

09:02.225 --> 09:03.226
E- major.

09:06.229 --> 09:07.230
I don't know.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.232
Do you think
it's too down?

09:09.732 --> 09:11.234
I mean, with
the chorus,

09:11.234 --> 09:13.236
"his blood clean
s every stain"?

09:13.236 --> 09:15.738
Oh, it's a great
mother- jumping
lyric, jan.

09:16.239 --> 09:17.740
What are we
sellin', ajax?

09:18.241 --> 09:20.243
"His blood
cleans stains"?

09:21.744 --> 09:23.746
My brother
, i hope.

09:23.746 --> 09:26.249
Shit, fuck.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.252
Hey, you guys,
come on in.

09:29.252 --> 09:30.753
We're just
working.

09:30.753 --> 09:32.255
On the fuse box?

09:32.255 --> 09:33.756
No, we're
making a demo,

09:33.756 --> 09:36.259
tryin' to get
some major label
interest here.

09:39.262 --> 09:40.763
God, the
poor thing.

09:51.774 --> 09:53.276
I'm not coming
to eat here

09:53.276 --> 09:55.278
unless this pig
sty is cleaned up!

09:55.278 --> 09:57.280
It's my
wrist, tony.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.783
And the percodans
aren't even
working anymore.

10:01.284 --> 10:02.785
You got an
y rubber gloves?

10:02.785 --> 10:04.287
I'll get started,

10:04.287 --> 10:06.289
and we can work
on the stock.

10:11.794 --> 10:13.296
Whoa, your wrist,

10:13.296 --> 10:15.798
i thought the
doctor said it
was just a sprain.

10:15.798 --> 10:17.800
Apparently, there's
nerve involvement.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.802
I may need
an operation.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.811
From the russian?

10:28.811 --> 10:30.813
It was the worst
night of my life,

10:31.314 --> 10:34.317
but, it led
me to jesus.

10:34.317 --> 10:36.319
Come on, janice,
when's the last time

10:36.819 --> 10:38.821
you went to a
prayer meetin'?

10:40.823 --> 10:41.824
I know.

10:41.824 --> 10:44.827
And, aaron and i
don't even sleep
together anymore,

10:44.827 --> 10:47.330
but in a
larger sense,

10:47.330 --> 10:49.832
christianity's brought
about a business,

10:49.832 --> 10:50.833
with this ccm.

10:51.334 --> 10:52.335
The what?

10:52.835 --> 10:55.338
Christian
contemporary,
tony, ohh!

10:55.338 --> 10:57.840
It's the fastest growing
marketing sector

10:57.840 --> 11:00.343
in the music
business today.

11:00.343 --> 11:00.843
Here.

11:03.346 --> 11:06.349
You knocked over
your drink, honey.

11:06.349 --> 11:07.350
Ugh...

11:08.851 --> 11:10.853
really hurts, huh?

11:10.853 --> 11:12.355
Yeah.

11:12.355 --> 11:14.357
Janice!

11:37.380 --> 11:40.883
Ooh, here's
a branch.

11:40.883 --> 11:43.386
I don't see the
rest of the tree.

11:43.386 --> 11:45.888
Fuck that
philosophical shit.

11:46.389 --> 11:47.890
Oh, jesus.

11:47.890 --> 11:48.891
What?

11:48.891 --> 11:50.393
Oh, shit.

11:51.394 --> 11:53.396
That i
s depressing.

11:53.896 --> 11:56.399
I don't even
wanna fuckin'
touch this thing.

11:56.399 --> 11:57.900
Hey.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.402
The wife
sends her love.

11:59.402 --> 12:00.903
How are

12:00.903 --> 12:02.905
How ya doin',

12:02.905 --> 12:04.907
Tony,

12:04.907 --> 12:07.410

we found

12:07.410 --> 12:09.412
in the bottom of
the christmas box?

12:09.912 --> 12:11.414
The santa
outfit.

12:11.914 --> 12:13.416
You guessed!

12:13.916 --> 12:15.918
Burn the
fuckin' thing.

12:15.918 --> 12:17.420
This is the firs
t christmas in history

12:17.920 --> 12:19.422
i remember him
not bein' santa.

12:19.422 --> 12:20.923
Oh, big pussy.

12:20.923 --> 12:22.425
We were talkin'
the other day

12:22.425 --> 12:23.926
about that f
at piece of shit.

12:23.926 --> 12:26.929
When he got back f
rom boca at christmas of'95,

12:26.929 --> 12:28.431
how he wasn't himself.

12:28.931 --> 12:29.932
What happened to,

12:29.932 --> 12:32.435
"not wasting your breath
on the cocksucker"?

12:32.435 --> 12:34.437
Two- faced fuck!

12:34.437 --> 12:37.440
To sell out your friends
to save your own ass,
it's despicable.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.442
That's one rid
e i would've loved t
o have been along on.

12:39.442 --> 12:40.443
Yeah, me too.

12:40.943 --> 12:42.445
Enough of this shit,
put up the fuckin'
decorations.

12:42.445 --> 12:44.947
We still gotta
find somebody
to play santa.

12:48.951 --> 12:50.453
Get the fuck
outta here.

12:50.453 --> 12:51.954
It's
fitting,
you know.

12:52.455 --> 12:54.457
After all, it was
your father who started
this whole tradition.

12:54.457 --> 12:55.958
That's right,

12:55.958 --> 12:58.461
when johnny boy
busted this place
out and took it over,

12:58.461 --> 13:00.463
and old man
satriale put a
bullet in his own head,

13:00.963 --> 13:02.965
there was a lot of
sadness on the block.

13:02.965 --> 13:04.967
Nothing a christmas
ham couldn't fix.

13:05.968 --> 13:06.969
Come on, t.

13:07.470 --> 13:09.472
Fuckin' stop,
alright?

13:09.472 --> 13:10.973
Find somebody
else to do it.

13:30.493 --> 13:31.994
The big man!

13:31.994 --> 13:33.496
Come have drink.

13:33.996 --> 13:34.997
Where's slava?

13:34.997 --> 13:36.499
Working probably.

13:42.004 --> 13:43.005
Anthony...

13:45.007 --> 13:46.509
How are ya?

13:46.509 --> 13:49.011
You want

Food?

13:49.011 --> 13:50.012
No, we're just
gonna talk.

13:50.513 --> 13:53.015
Oh, high level.

13:53.015 --> 13:54.517
Shh.

13:56.519 --> 13:59.522
Looks like valery's
started to celebrate
christmas early.

13:59.522 --> 14:01.023
You don't know
the half!

14:01.524 --> 14:03.526
Russian christmas don'
t come till mid- january.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.535
There's a quarter
mil in there,

14:12.535 --> 14:14.537
my own personal funds.

14:14.537 --> 14:17.540
I'll send it to moscow
with the ibm thinkpads.

14:17.540 --> 14:20.042
But, this time, i want
to use promstrybank.

14:20.543 --> 14:23.045
Anyway, they will se
nd it to the isle of man,

14:23.045 --> 14:25.047

numbered account.

14:25.047 --> 14:26.549
Agron...

14:37.059 --> 14:38.060
thanks.

14:39.061 --> 14:42.064
Galina loved
the escalante,
by the way.

14:42.565 --> 14:44.066
You think you
can get another one?

14:44.567 --> 14:46.068
There is
something, maybe,

14:46.068 --> 14:48.070
you can help me with.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.573
You tell me what it is
, i'll tell you if i can help.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.576
I'm looking
for this russian,

14:54.076 --> 14:56.078
he's a friend of
svetlana kirilenko,

14:56.078 --> 14:58.080
you know,
irina's cousin.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.582
The one- legged woman
, i know who she is.

15:00.082 --> 15:02.084
But, i don't
want her involved.

15:02.084 --> 15:04.587
All i know about this guy
is he drives a livery cab,

15:04.587 --> 15:08.090
and he wasn't very nice
to someone important to me.

15:08.090 --> 15:09.592
Don't think another
thing about this.

15:09.592 --> 15:12.094
I'll find him, i'll kick
the shit out of him.

15:12.094 --> 15:14.096
No, no, no,
i'm gonna do this.

15:14.096 --> 15:16.098
This motherfucker's mine.

15:52.134 --> 15:54.136
What happened
to the jarlsbe
rg that was here?

15:54.136 --> 15:55.638
What, sil?

15:55.638 --> 15:57.640
Stop the music.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.642
Cut, stop the music!

15:59.642 --> 16:03.646
There was an entir
e wedge of jarlsberg
here this morning.

16:04.146 --> 16:05.147
What happened to it?

16:05.147 --> 16:06.148
I don't know.

16:06.148 --> 16:07.149
Goddamnit!

16:07.149 --> 16:08.651
Debbie had a rondelay
of french brie

16:09.151 --> 16:10.152
missing from her
purse yesterday.

16:10.653 --> 16:11.654
In there?

16:11.654 --> 16:12.655
Uh- huh.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.683
Ever since w
e found that suit,

16:41.183 --> 16:43.185
now i'm dreaming about
that fat rat bastard.

16:43.686 --> 16:45.187
What about it?

16:45.187 --> 16:47.189
We did the
right thing.

16:50.192 --> 16:52.194
You're startin'
to worry me.

16:52.194 --> 16:54.196
You got a problem?

16:54.196 --> 16:56.699
'95.

16:56.699 --> 17:00.202
I can't believe
i didn't see it.

17:00.202 --> 17:03.706
I had a fucking lamp
down here, but meadow
took it to school.

17:04.205 --> 17:06.208
You think it was
down in boca, though,

17:06.709 --> 17:08.711
i mean, he was
bringing the s
hit in through there?

17:09.211 --> 17:10.713
No, it wasn't boca.

17:10.713 --> 17:12.714
They didn't
flip him in boca.

17:12.714 --> 17:14.717
He was down there
for 24 hours

17:14.717 --> 17:16.719
to set up the sit- down
with my uncle,

17:16.719 --> 17:18.220
and i know,
for a fact,

17:18.220 --> 17:19.722
he was with my uncle
the whole time.

17:19.722 --> 17:22.223
It was the sit- down.

17:22.724 --> 17:25.227
Simpson himself attend
ed barbieri's deposition,

17:25.728 --> 17:26.729
but made no comment.

17:26.729 --> 17:29.231
Next week, simpson
faces another challenge,

17:29.231 --> 17:31.734
the goldman attorney
is seeking access...

17:31.734 --> 17:33.235
i'm saturated
with it.

17:33.235 --> 17:36.739
...in anticipation of
collecting punitive damages...

17:41.744 --> 17:42.745
corrado.

17:42.745 --> 17:44.747
John.

17:46.749 --> 17:47.750
Where's
bonpensiero?

17:48.250 --> 17:49.251
He's not here yet.

17:49.251 --> 17:50.753
He supposed
to be here.

17:50.753 --> 17:53.255
He brokered
the fuckin' thing.

17:53.255 --> 17:54.757
Hey, i'm here.

17:54.757 --> 17:56.258
What do you think?

17:56.258 --> 17:58.260
I'm gonna let'em hurt
my only uncle?

17:58.260 --> 17:59.261
No.

17:59.261 --> 18:00.763
Sit down.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.769
Where the fuck
were you?

18:06.769 --> 18:11.273
You better have a good excus
for why you're still alive.

18:11.273 --> 18:13.275
I'm sorry,
skipper, it'll
never happen again.

18:13.776 --> 18:15.277
I hope nobody called
the house, though.

18:15.277 --> 18:16.779
I told ange
i was with you.

18:17.279 --> 18:19.281
My goomar's mother, we were
in the hospital all night,

18:19.281 --> 18:20.783
t. I. A. , that's
a small stroke,

18:21.283 --> 18:23.285
she lost use
of her left hand.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.788
It's coming back now,
but, i didn't eat--

18:25.788 --> 18:27.790
did you get laid?

18:27.790 --> 18:29.291
Yeah.

18:31.293 --> 18:33.295
We should've known,
right then,

18:33.295 --> 18:35.798
when he was m. I.
A. From that sit- down.

18:37.299 --> 18:39.802
That's all the
time you need.

18:39.802 --> 18:41.804
When they
flip somebody,

18:41.804 --> 18:44.306
they try to get
him back on the
street right away,

18:44.306 --> 18:45.808
that very day.

18:46.809 --> 18:49.812
So, you don't
have time to think.

18:50.312 --> 18:53.816
Sil, what are you gettin'
your goomar for christmas?

18:53.816 --> 18:56.819
Cash, that's the
only thing tha
t shuts her up

18:56.819 --> 18:58.821
about bein' al
one over the holidays.

18:58.821 --> 19:00.322
Michelle likes "ice".

19:00.322 --> 19:02.324
I'm getting a piece
from a jew in the city.

19:02.324 --> 19:04.827
T, what are you gettin'
your new goomar?

19:04.827 --> 19:05.828
She did me a favor.

19:05.828 --> 19:07.830
She went to morocco
over the holidays.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.331
On her own?
She paid for it?

19:09.832 --> 19:10.332
Yeah.

19:10.332 --> 19:11.834
She went
to morocco?

19:12.334 --> 19:13.836
Who is she,
bada bing crosby?

19:13.836 --> 19:15.838
She's not one
of those girls.

19:15.838 --> 19:17.840
She's got
a real job.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.843
She sells mercedes,
smart, gorgeous...

19:20.843 --> 19:22.845
too good
to be true.

19:22.845 --> 19:25.347
Speaking of which,
who's that piece of ass?

19:27.349 --> 19:29.852
Oh, madonn',
look who it is.

19:32.354 --> 19:34.356
It's the miracle
of christmas.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.358
Next the blind
will see,

19:36.358 --> 19:38.360
and the lame
will walk.

19:43.365 --> 19:46.368
So, how is
everything here
so far, tonight?

19:46.869 --> 19:48.871
Much better now
that we've cast
our glims

19:48.871 --> 19:50.372
on you,
sweetheart.

19:50.372 --> 19:51.874
How you doin',
'mainy?

19:51.874 --> 19:54.376
Fine, tony- oni.

19:55.878 --> 19:57.379
Listen...

19:58.380 --> 20:00.382
i thought
you'd wanna know.

20:00.382 --> 20:02.384
Two guys over there,
at that table...

20:03.385 --> 20:03.886
yeah?

20:04.386 --> 20:05.888
I think
they're fbi.

20:08.390 --> 20:10.392
I'm kidding.

20:11.894 --> 20:13.896
I'm kidding,
enjoy.

20:20.903 --> 20:22.905
He's ready.

20:29.411 --> 20:31.914
You are
a hypocrite.

20:31.914 --> 20:33.415
That's what
you are.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.417
You vilify a man
behind his back,

20:35.918 --> 20:37.419
and then you
smile in his face.

20:39.421 --> 20:41.924
Something's gotta
keep the customers
coming back

20:41.924 --> 20:45.928
and it's not gonna
be your mooshata
raviolis, lately.

20:50.933 --> 20:52.434
Hey.

20:52.935 --> 20:54.436
Charmaine...

20:54.436 --> 20:57.439
sometimes we're forced
to work the same shift.

20:57.439 --> 21:00.442
Your wife, her ass may
be improved artie, but--

21:00.442 --> 21:02.444
hey, hey, hey,
come on, sil.

21:06.448 --> 21:09.451
She's over here
joking about the fbi.

21:09.451 --> 21:10.953
Since when
is that funny?

21:14.957 --> 21:15.958
Yeah.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.963
No, wait,
hold on a minute.

21:21.964 --> 21:23.966
Go ahead.

21:30.472 --> 21:32.474
Alright, great.

21:32.975 --> 21:34.977
Yeah...

21:35.477 --> 21:37.980
merry christmas
to you, too.

21:39.982 --> 21:41.984
Mr. Valdez?

21:41.984 --> 21:43.485
That's me.

21:54.496 --> 21:55.998
I know you.

21:55.998 --> 21:58.500
You look like maybe
someone, i don't know...

21:58.500 --> 22:00.002
he's the
designata drive.

22:00.002 --> 22:01.503
Me?

22:01.503 --> 22:03.505
No, you the
designata drive.

22:04.006 --> 22:06.008
No, no, you,
you, it's you.

22:06.508 --> 22:07.509
You!

22:07.509 --> 22:09.511
Airport ramada,
right?

22:10.012 --> 22:11.013
Yeah.

22:11.513 --> 22:12.514
Yeah, let'
s go, c'mon.

22:25.027 --> 22:26.528
How was dinner?

22:27.029 --> 22:28.030
Good.

22:29.531 --> 22:31.533
Was charmaine there?

22:32.034 --> 22:33.035
Yep.

22:33.035 --> 22:35.537
She looks good,
doesn't she?

22:35.537 --> 22:37.039
What, are you
disappointed?

22:37.039 --> 22:40.042
Her husband dumped her,
you thought she was gonna
look like a krull?

22:40.042 --> 22:42.544
A krull?

22:42.544 --> 22:46.048
A crone, a troll,
i don't know.

22:48.050 --> 22:50.552
Holiday traffic.

22:50.552 --> 22:53.555
My head is
clanging like a bell.

22:53.555 --> 22:55.557
I got the scooter.

23:09.571 --> 23:11.073
Yay!!

23:11.073 --> 23:12.074
Hello bedford falls!

23:12.074 --> 23:13.575
Oh, jesus.

23:13.575 --> 23:15.077
Merry christmas!

23:15.077 --> 23:16.578
Enough already.

23:16.578 --> 23:19.581
Merry christmas, george.

23:19.698 --> 23:22.084
Santa, we still
haven't got one.

23:22.084 --> 23:23.085
You wanna
do it?

23:23.585 --> 23:25.087
Me, what do
i know about it?

23:25.587 --> 23:27.089
I don't have kids.

23:27.089 --> 23:29.091
You don't have to,
santa doesn't
have any kids.

23:29.091 --> 23:31.093
Yeah, that's strange,

23:31.093 --> 23:33.595
that mr. And mrs. Claus
didn't have kids of their own.

23:34.096 --> 23:36.098
Probably why
they got into it
in the first place.

23:36.098 --> 23:37.599
I used to think the
elves were their kids.

23:37.599 --> 23:39.101
They were running
a sweatshop over there.

23:39.601 --> 23:40.602
There was
something on tv,

23:40.602 --> 23:42.604
the original
elves were ugly,

23:42.604 --> 23:45.107
traveled with santa to
throw bad kids a beatin',

23:45.107 --> 23:47.109
and he gave
the good ones toys.

23:47.109 --> 23:49.611
The fuckin' grinch.

23:50.112 --> 23:52.114
Maybe that's where
they got the idea.

23:52.114 --> 23:54.616
And fuckin' dr. Seuss
ripped it off.

23:54.616 --> 23:56.618
That grinch, man,
that's where the money is.

23:56.618 --> 23:58.620
A couple hundred mil.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.622
Put jim carrey
in the motherfucker.

24:00.622 --> 24:02.124
Tony...

24:02.124 --> 24:03.125
hey!

24:03.125 --> 24:05.127
I got stuff for
the party, toys.

24:05.627 --> 24:06.628
From me and junior.

24:07.129 --> 24:08.130
They're not wrapped,

24:08.130 --> 24:10.132
but this way they can
see what they're getting.

24:10.632 --> 24:11.633
Tell junior
thank you.

24:19.641 --> 24:20.642
What?

24:20.642 --> 24:22.644
Ho- fuckin'- ho.

24:22.644 --> 24:24.646
You're right.

24:24.646 --> 24:26.148
What are you
talking about?

24:26.148 --> 24:28.150
You wanna play santa claus
at the party this year?

24:28.650 --> 24:29.651
No, i can't do that.

24:29.651 --> 24:31.153
Why not?

24:31.153 --> 24:33.655
I don't know,
i don't know how.

24:34.156 --> 24:35.157
What's to know?

24:35.157 --> 24:36.658
You ask'em what
they want for christmas,

24:36.658 --> 24:39.161
you give'em a nice to
y, and that's the end ofit.

24:39.161 --> 24:40.662
No, not me,
i can't.

24:40.662 --> 24:41.663
Yes, you can.

24:41.663 --> 24:42.664
I can't!

24:42.664 --> 24:43.165
Why not?

24:43.665 --> 24:44.666
I'm shy.

24:49.171 --> 24:51.673
The boss of this
family told you

24:51.673 --> 24:53.175
you're gonna
be santa claus,

24:53.175 --> 24:54.676
you're santa claus.

24:54.676 --> 24:57.179
So, shut
the fuck up
about it.

25:06.688 --> 25:09.691
A strange and macabre
christmas story,

25:09.691 --> 25:12.194
another sad incidence
of continuing violence

25:12.194 --> 25:13.695
against livery drivers.

25:13.695 --> 25:16.198
In downtown newark,
police were called
to the scene

25:16.198 --> 25:18.700
of what appeared to
be a christmas prank
gone awry.

25:18.700 --> 25:21.203
Livery driver
igor parnasky

25:21.203 --> 25:23.705
was found trapped
under santa's sleigh,

25:23.705 --> 25:26.708
and severely beaten
inside the window display

25:26.708 --> 25:28.210
at curran's
sporting goods.

25:28.210 --> 25:29.711
The russian emigre
also suffered

25:29.711 --> 25:31.713
injuries
from broken glass.

25:31.713 --> 25:33.215
From his description
of his assailants,

25:33.215 --> 25:35.217
police are
questioning members

25:35.217 --> 25:36.718
of a marauding
youth gang...

25:36.718 --> 25:38.220
oh, my god!

25:38.220 --> 25:39.221
...their turf.

25:39.221 --> 25:40.722
Merry christmas.

25:40.722 --> 25:43.725

25:55.237 --> 25:58.240
I think i know wha
t's missing from the song.

25:58.740 --> 26:01.243
It's the brother concept.

26:01.243 --> 26:02.244
He ain't heavy?

26:02.244 --> 26:04.246
No, i mean

26:06.248 --> 26:08.750
Maybe we can try t
o get something down.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.753
Jan, you're crying.

26:11.753 --> 26:14.756
Sometimes
we really don'

26:21.763 --> 26:25.267
Hi, whatcha doing?

26:26.768 --> 26:30.272

26:32.774 --> 26:34.276
Me, too.

26:42.284 --> 26:44.286
You'

26:44.286 --> 26:47.789
Hunter went
into the city
with hadley.

26:52.794 --> 26:54.796
So, where's
jackie tonight?

26:54.796 --> 26:57.799
He had to go visit a frien
d of his in the hospital.

26:57.799 --> 26:59.301
Oh, no, who?

26:59.301 --> 27:01.303
Someone from school,
they think it's
appendicitis.

27:01.303 --> 27:02.804
Oh, my god.

27:04.306 --> 27:07.809
So, you and jackie are
getting pretty close, huh?

27:16.318 --> 27:18.320
That new angel
looks really great.

27:26.828 --> 27:28.330

what he said.

27:28.330 --> 27:29.831

27:52.354 --> 27:53.855
Thank you.

27:53.855 --> 27:56.858
I'm trying to
give you a compliment.

27:56.858 --> 27:57.859
Well, don't.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.861
What's your
fuckin' problem?

27:59.861 --> 28:01.863
All these years,
i've sat here and
i kept my mouth shut.

28:01.863 --> 28:04.366
I didn't want you and
your boys comin' in here.

28:04.366 --> 28:06.368
And look

28:06.368 --> 28:07.869

28:08.370 --> 28:09.871
Artie? I'm trying
to help him.

28:09.871 --> 28:10.872
Yeah, well

28:11.373 --> 28:12.874

28:17.379 --> 28:18.880
Let's get the fuck

29:47.969 --> 29:49.971

You bottomed out.

30:10.992 --> 30:12.994

30:21.002 --> 30:22.504
You bottomed out.

30:35.517 --> 30:38.520
I wish i could get up
at 11:30 every morning

30:39.020 --> 30:41.022
after being out all
night, god knows where.

30:44.025 --> 30:46.528
Stop with the
pots and pans.

30:46.528 --> 30:48.029
Where were you
last night?

30:48.029 --> 30:49.030
Nowhere,

30:49.030 --> 30:50.532
i wasn't anywhere.

30:50.532 --> 30:53.535
I was the monogamy
poster boy, swear to god.

30:53.535 --> 30:54.536
Oh, please.

30:56.538 --> 30:59.541
Well, i break up
with the so- called
russian whore,

30:59.541 --> 31:01.042
i'm towing
the line,

31:01.543 --> 31:02.544
and this is
the thanks i get!

31:02.544 --> 31:04.546
What about
charmaine?

31:04.546 --> 31:06.047
Charmaine?

31:06.548 --> 31:08.049
Mm- hmm, i know
all about you.

31:08.049 --> 31:09.551
What?

31:09.551 --> 31:11.553
I didn't d
o anything.

31:12.053 --> 31:13.054
Yeah, you did
in high school.

31:13.054 --> 31:14.055
High school?

31:14.055 --> 31:16.057
Don't try
to deny it.

31:16.057 --> 31:18.560
Oh, okay,
high school, okay.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.562
Her husband dumps her and
she never looked so good?

31:20.562 --> 31:22.564
You gotta ask
yourself why.

31:24.065 --> 31:26.067
I didn't
do nothing.

31:26.067 --> 31:27.569
I didn't do nothing!

31:28.069 --> 31:29.070
It's too late.

31:29.070 --> 31:30.572
I don't believe
anything you say.

31:36.578 --> 31:41.082
My wife had her doubts
about jackie jr...

31:41.082 --> 31:45.086
and all along i
kept defending the
little two- faced prick.

31:45.086 --> 31:49.090
Do you feel responsible
for their relationship?

31:49.090 --> 31:51.593
Meadow thinks she'd still
going out with the oreo cookie

31:51.593 --> 31:53.595
if it wasn't for me.

31:53.595 --> 31:55.597
Well, that's true,
isn't it?

31:57.599 --> 32:00.602
The question i
s, what am i gonna
do about jackie?

32:00.602 --> 32:02.604
Should i tell my wife?

32:02.604 --> 32:04.606
Meadow,
jesus, she's--

32:06.107 --> 32:08.610
it'd break her heart
if she knew.

32:18.119 --> 32:20.622
On another subject,

32:20.622 --> 32:23.124
i was thinking about
what we were talking about

32:23.124 --> 32:25.126
last time
you were here.

32:25.126 --> 32:26.127
You know,

32:26.628 --> 32:29.130
your friend who was working
for the federal government?

32:29.130 --> 32:31.633
Granted i get
most of my information

32:31.633 --> 32:34.135
from the movies
and bill curtis.

32:34.135 --> 32:36.137
But i was thinking...

32:46.648 --> 32:49.651
they're around
the block out there.

32:49.651 --> 32:51.152
Biggest one yet.

32:51.152 --> 32:53.154
Where's the
friggin' beard?

32:53.154 --> 32:55.156
I saw it
in the box.

32:55.156 --> 32:56.658
It's gotta
be there.

32:56.658 --> 32:58.660
Even without padding,

32:58.660 --> 33:01.162
the suit's too small
on this fatso.

33:04.666 --> 33:06.668
Motherfucker.

33:07.669 --> 33:09.671
What, ton'?

33:09.671 --> 33:11.673
He was wearing a wire...

33:12.674 --> 33:14.676
when he came
to the party

33:14.676 --> 33:17.679
he already
had the suit on.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.682
Alvin!

33:21.182 --> 33:22.684
Okay!

33:27.188 --> 33:29.691

33:33.695 --> 33:35.697

33:36.197 --> 33:37.699
Kevin, go make
me a sandwich.

33:37.699 --> 33:38.700
Okay, dad.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.201
He's a method actor.

33:40.201 --> 33:42.203
Getting into character
like al.

33:42.203 --> 33:43.204
Yeah...

33:43.204 --> 33:45.707
"it was you, fredo."

33:45.707 --> 33:48.209
Look at that, don'
t even need a pillow.

33:48.209 --> 33:50.211
Hey!
Watch the suit!

33:51.212 --> 33:53.715
He can't
make a joke?

33:53.715 --> 33:56.217
What, are you
mr. Sensitive

33:56.217 --> 33:58.720

34:19.741 --> 34:21.743

Oh, it's as cold as

36:01.843 --> 36:03.344
C'mon, next

36:03.344 --> 36:05.847
It would kill him
to say "ho, ho, ho"?

36:05.847 --> 36:07.348
You were
just here.

36:07.348 --> 36:08.850

36:08.850 --> 36:10.852
Yeah, you were

36:11.853 --> 36:13.354

36:15.356 --> 36:16.858
Fuck you, santa!

36:16.858 --> 36:18.860
Hey! Hey!

36:18.860 --> 36:20.361
Gregorio!

36:20.862 --> 36:22.363
How dare you talk
that way to santa.

36:22.363 --> 36:24.365
He never talks
that way at home.

36:24.365 --> 36:25.366
My friend,

36:25.366 --> 36:27.869
you don't talk
that way to santa.

36:27.869 --> 36:29.871
Get back there, tell
santa you're sorry.

36:30.371 --> 36:31.372
Go on.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.877
I'm sorry,
santa.

36:35.877 --> 36:36.878
That's better.

36:40.381 --> 36:43.384
I don't care,
you are punished.

36:43.384 --> 36:45.887
What the hell's
wrong with you, bobby?

36:45.887 --> 36:47.889
You got kids
of your own.

36:47.889 --> 36:49.390
I didn't
wanna do this.

36:49.390 --> 36:50.892
Shyness
is a curse.

36:50.892 --> 36:53.394
Why don't you
lighten up a little
bit? It's christmas.

36:55.396 --> 36:56.898
C'mere, honey.

36:56.898 --> 36:58.900
Don't be
scared of santa.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.401
C'mon,
there you go.

37:00.401 --> 37:03.404
Next year he goes
to santa school.

37:03.404 --> 37:05.907
Fuckin' ho hum
, if you ask me.

37:05.907 --> 37:07.909
I don't miss pussy's
fake fuckin' good cheer,

37:08.409 --> 37:09.410
tell you the truth.

37:09.410 --> 37:11.412
Let him st
ay with the fish.

37:13.414 --> 37:15.917
Why'd you go to
that psychic last year?

37:15.917 --> 37:18.419
Since you don't
dwell on this shit.

37:18.419 --> 37:19.921
That was different.

37:19.921 --> 37:21.422
Chrissy was shot.

37:21.422 --> 37:23.925
That was
a paranormal event.

37:23.925 --> 37:26.427
What the fuck are
you talking about?

37:26.427 --> 37:29.430
That psychic told
you those guys were
haunting you.

37:29.430 --> 37:30.932
The guys
that you...

37:31.432 --> 37:32.433
pussy,

37:32.934 --> 37:34.936
i loved that cocksucker
like a brother

37:34.936 --> 37:37.438
and he fucked
me in the ass.

37:37.438 --> 37:40.441
That's the difference
between puss and the others.

37:41.442 --> 37:43.444
Him you loved.

37:43.444 --> 37:45.446
The world
don't run on love.

37:45.446 --> 37:47.949
He was a rat bastard.

37:47.949 --> 37:49.951
One thing
you got to admit,

37:49.951 --> 37:51.953
he made a great
santa claus.

37:51.953 --> 37:53.955
He did.

37:53.955 --> 37:56.457
In the end,
fuck santa claus.

38:04.966 --> 38:06.467
Another sweater.

38:06.467 --> 38:08.469
That's from nana.

38:10.471 --> 38:11.973
You're gonna tell
her how much you like
it when she gets here.

38:11.973 --> 38:13.474
Who could that
be so early?

38:13.474 --> 38:16.477
Let me see,
maybe it'll
fit me.

38:16.477 --> 38:18.479
It's not bad,
better than last year.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.481
Jackie jr. , hi.

38:20.481 --> 38:21.983

38:21.983 --> 38:23.484

aunt carm.

38:23.484 --> 38:25.486
It's okay

38:25.987 --> 38:28.990
We're just
opening our presents.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.002
Merry christmas,
ton'.

38:41.002 --> 38:42.003
Good morning.

38:42.003 --> 38:43.504

38:45.006 --> 38:48.009

38:50.511 --> 38:52.013
This is

38:52.013 --> 38:54.015
Wow,
thank you.

38:54.515 --> 38:55.516
Let me get
your present.

38:55.516 --> 38:57.518
No, you can open
yours first
if you want.

38:57.518 --> 38:59.020
Okay.

39:08.529 --> 39:12.033
This is so
beautiful, jackie,

39:12.533 --> 39:13.534
thank you.

39:14.035 --> 39:16.037
There's something
on the back.

39:18.539 --> 39:20.541
"To m. S. From j. A.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.543
I will
always be true."

39:23.544 --> 39:25.046
Oh, jackie.

39:36.557 --> 39:38.059
I'll be
right back.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.561
C'mere, le
t me see that.

39:49.070 --> 39:51.572
Can i talk to you?

39:57.578 --> 40:00.081
I flunked out
of rutgers.

40:02.583 --> 40:05.586
I'm sorry, i know
i fucked up.

40:05.586 --> 40:08.089
I got distracted
this year by things.

40:10.091 --> 40:12.593
Ralph said i was probably
wasting my time

40:13.094 --> 40:14.595
if i didn't
have the aptitude.

40:14.595 --> 40:15.596
Ralph?

40:16.097 --> 40:18.599
You know, he didn't
go to school,

40:18.599 --> 40:21.602
and look at the money
he was making
when he was my age.

40:21.602 --> 40:23.104
And the piece,

40:23.104 --> 40:25.106
my car got broken into
a couple of times
at the frat house,

40:25.106 --> 40:27.608
so ralph
gave it to me.

40:29.110 --> 40:31.612
It was fuckin'
stupid, i know it.

40:31.612 --> 40:33.614
But tony, i'm gonna
be alright now.

40:33.614 --> 40:35.616
I'm gonna
design men's suits.

40:35.616 --> 40:38.619
Meadow thinks i
should go to the
fashion institute.

40:38.619 --> 40:41.622
I really think i
could be good if i
applied myself.

40:41.622 --> 40:45.126
You bullshit me
and you betray
my daughter.

40:47.628 --> 40:49.130
I'm sorry.

40:50.131 --> 40:51.632
I'm sorry.

40:53.134 --> 40:54.635
Go back inside.

40:57.138 --> 40:59.140
I'm gonna
be frank on this.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.143
I haven't decide
d what to do with you.

41:12.153 --> 41:13.654
Comin' through!

41:15.656 --> 41:17.658
You can't
stay?

41:17.658 --> 41:20.161
I still have

your present.

41:20.161 --> 41:22.663
I'm driving mo
m up to the home
to see grandma.

41:27.668 --> 41:30.171
Thank you for my
beautiful necklace.

41:41.182 --> 41:43.184
Merry christmas.

41:47.188 --> 41:48.689
Merry christmas.

41:50.691 --> 41:52.693
Go be with your family
and open your presents.

41:52.693 --> 41:54.195

42:05.206 --> 42:06.707
Oh, my god.

42:06.707 --> 42:08.709

42:08.709 --> 42:10.211

Wow.

42:12.213 --> 42:13.714
Mmm.

42:13.714 --> 42:15.716
Well, uh,

42:15.716 --> 42:20.221

seem really stupid
after that, but,

42:20.221 --> 42:22.223
it's your turn, dad.

42:22.223 --> 42:24.225
This is for you.

42:27.228 --> 42:29.730
I didn't think
you were gonna
get me anything.

42:29.730 --> 42:31.732
After...

42:31.732 --> 42:33.234
it's christmas.

42:38.239 --> 42:39.740
Thank you.

42:40.241 --> 42:41.742
Come on,

42:41.742 --> 42:43.744
What is it?

42:49.250 --> 42:51.252
"Big mouth billy bass",
what is that?

42:51.752 --> 42:52.753
Oh, those are good.

42:53.254 --> 42:55.256
Wait till you see
what it does.

42:55.256 --> 42:56.757
What does
it do?

42:57.258 --> 42:58.759
You'll see.

42:58.759 --> 43:00.761
I know i give you
