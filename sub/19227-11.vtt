WEBVTT

00:00.891 --> 00:03.414
Okay, guys, formal is this Friday,

00:03.508 --> 00:05.296
and this year, I think
I have a good chance

00:05.321 --> 00:07.093
of being voted for queen.

00:07.118 --> 00:08.289
Which is better...

00:08.307 --> 00:10.311
"Beyoncé at the music awards" Rachel,

00:10.336 --> 00:13.337
or "Jennifer Lawrence at
the kids' pick awards" Rachel?

00:13.362 --> 00:15.562
How about "Rachel at
the spring formal" Rachel?

00:15.598 --> 00:18.265
Four other girls are
already going with that look.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.535
It's so much easier to find the
perfect date than the perfect dress.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.604
I'm going with Ben.

00:23.639 --> 00:25.126
Brian? Something.

00:25.220 --> 00:27.120
I'm gonna call him Blake.

00:27.155 --> 00:29.222
Rachel and Blake. That's good.

00:29.258 --> 00:31.124
Well, I'm not changing my date's name.

00:31.159 --> 00:33.326
We go great together. Wyatt and Georgie.

00:33.362 --> 00:35.295
Wy-G to the fans.

00:35.330 --> 00:37.364
Who'd you decide to go with, Harley?

00:37.399 --> 00:41.067
I'm not going. Otherwise known
as "no one" to the fans.

00:41.103 --> 00:42.302
- No way.
- What?!

00:42.337 --> 00:44.371
There's no guy I really wanna go with.

00:46.108 --> 00:47.474
Face it.

00:47.509 --> 00:49.509
Your first high school
formal... awkward.

00:49.544 --> 00:52.212
But with three other
siblings there, too?

00:52.247 --> 00:55.048
You know those scary movies where
the really bad things happen

00:55.083 --> 00:57.117
to the nice girl at the prom?

00:58.453 --> 01:00.453
That will be this.

01:00.489 --> 01:02.455
Oh, I have someone you can go with.

01:02.491 --> 01:04.625
Blake's brother
who didn't get the looks.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.695
Well, as hard as it is to turn down

01:07.720 --> 01:09.462
a random guy's unattractive brother,

01:09.498 --> 01:11.398
I'm going to take a pass.

01:13.335 --> 01:15.402
Besides, I would only wanna
go with a friend.

01:15.437 --> 01:18.138
Ooh, make sure it's the kind of
friend you have chemistry with.

01:18.173 --> 01:20.362
Like me and Wyatt. What?

01:20.387 --> 01:21.901
You don't think we have chemistry?

01:21.926 --> 01:23.143
Well, tell me now, 'cause
I don't want to get hurt.

01:23.178 --> 01:25.145
No, it's this thing Josh sent me.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.381
We're in the Society
of Junior Inventors together.

01:28.417 --> 01:30.283
He's so funny.

01:30.319 --> 01:32.849
Wait, listen to this.
Two inventors walk into a lab...

01:32.874 --> 01:35.656
Wait. Did you say Josh?

01:35.681 --> 01:37.657
Yeah, but that's not the joke part.

01:37.692 --> 01:40.460
No. Ask Josh to the formal.

01:40.495 --> 01:41.594
What?!

01:41.630 --> 01:43.396
We've only ever emailed.

01:43.431 --> 01:45.331
He's running next year's Invent-A-Con.

01:45.367 --> 01:48.234
He's a sophomore at Middlebrook High.
Super smart.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.603
- Is he cute?
- Oh, who cares?

01:50.639 --> 01:52.672
All that matters is if he's kind
and has a good personality.

01:52.707 --> 01:55.441
Save it for your "Yay People" seminar.

01:55.477 --> 01:56.609
This is a formal.

01:56.645 --> 01:59.379
Going with Josh could be fun.

01:59.414 --> 02:02.448
Plus we have to set
the agenda for Invent-A-Con.

02:02.484 --> 02:05.185
Might as well do it while
watching teachers try to nae-nae.

02:05.220 --> 02:09.189
Yes! I can't wait to shop for "Harley
at her first school dance" Harley.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.594
All right. I'm going to
my first big dance.

02:15.829 --> 02:17.530
With a guy I barely know.

02:17.566 --> 02:19.532
And all my siblings watching.

02:19.568 --> 02:22.468
This is if Josh even says yes.

02:22.504 --> 02:24.437
Wow! I could really use

02:24.472 --> 02:26.506
a "Yay People" seminar right now.

02:26.541 --> 02:28.241

03:21.363 --> 03:22.462
Seriously?

03:22.497 --> 03:24.330
You're breathing so loud.

03:24.366 --> 03:27.267
Haven't heard back from
inventor guy yet, huh?

03:27.302 --> 03:28.668
I asked him.

03:28.703 --> 03:31.504
I wanted it to be like no biggie,
but at the same time, biggie.

03:31.539 --> 03:33.473
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

03:33.508 --> 03:35.508
<i>Why text when you can use science?</i>

03:37.646 --> 03:38.876
Pretty bold move,

03:38.901 --> 03:41.514
considering the last time you
sent liquids through the mail,

03:41.549 --> 03:42.582
the authorities came to the house.

03:42.617 --> 03:44.684
It was just goo from a glow stick.

03:44.719 --> 03:47.287
And don't act like you didn't
enjoy meeting the FBI.

03:47.322 --> 03:49.389
So who's your date to the dance?

03:49.424 --> 03:51.557
I've got two actually.

03:51.593 --> 03:54.227
I'm talking about
my laptop and a turntable.

03:54.262 --> 03:56.596
- I'm deejaying.
- Since when do you deejay?

03:56.631 --> 03:59.532
Since I determined the best
way to Kendra Swenson's heart

03:59.567 --> 04:02.402
is to play her favorite song at
the dance and dedicate it to her.

04:02.437 --> 04:04.203
Sounds complicated.

04:04.239 --> 04:05.538
You're right. I should've used

04:05.573 --> 04:07.640
advanced chemistry and a petri dish.

04:07.676 --> 04:09.409
Harley, this just came for you.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.213
It's from Josh.

04:15.684 --> 04:17.517
Whoa. Ha ha.

04:21.456 --> 04:23.222
Hey, the periodic table.

04:23.258 --> 04:24.657
I remember forgetting that in science.

04:24.693 --> 04:27.327
Sulphur, uranium, rhenium.

04:27.362 --> 04:30.430
Oh, the FBI is so coming
back to this house.

04:30.465 --> 04:32.632
Wait. S-U-Re.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.600
Sure.

04:34.636 --> 04:36.636
He said sure!

04:38.406 --> 04:39.605
Finally, something about
chemistry I like.

04:39.641 --> 04:44.344
So we're all going
to the dance together!

04:46.715 --> 04:49.315
- Whoopie cushion.
- Check.

04:50.618 --> 04:54.220
- Jawbreaker.
- Check.

04:54.255 --> 04:56.422
Hey, guys, thanks for
cleaning out the cubbies.

04:56.458 --> 04:59.459
- This is for camping.
- Camping.

04:59.494 --> 05:02.395
We're gathering
the essentials for survival.

05:02.430 --> 05:04.330
Are you sure you don't want to stay in?

05:04.366 --> 05:06.199
I'll make popcorn... on the stove,

05:06.234 --> 05:08.201
not in the microwave;
I'll let you shake the pan.

05:08.236 --> 05:10.636
No, thanks. With the big
kids at that lame dance,

05:10.672 --> 05:12.605
we'll have the backyard
all to ourselves.

05:17.579 --> 05:20.246
I know a lot of
my business is selling tents,

05:20.281 --> 05:22.215
but I hate when they camp.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.183
Yes. They have fun while we stay up

05:24.219 --> 05:25.518
waiting for them to come in,

05:25.553 --> 05:27.420
because they're cold, hungry or scared.

05:27.455 --> 05:30.289
And one of them always
pees in a sleeping bag.

05:30.325 --> 05:32.225
If only there were some way
to make them miserable

05:32.260 --> 05:33.526
sooner than later.

05:36.598 --> 05:41.367
How would you like to go
camping in the backyard tonight?

05:41.403 --> 05:43.369
I'll make popcorn.

05:43.405 --> 05:45.271
On the stove, not the microwave.

05:45.306 --> 05:47.206
- I'll let you shake the pan.
- Not interested.

05:47.242 --> 05:50.243
Guys, clear a path.
It's an hour till formal,

05:50.278 --> 05:52.512
and I need to show Harley
how to walk in high heels.

05:52.547 --> 05:56.215
Anything in this zone is not safe.

05:56.251 --> 05:58.618
Good news. I'm in for the camping.

06:01.456 --> 06:03.256
Big night.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.291
Ooh, I should probably
take the pictures.

06:05.326 --> 06:07.393
You're gonna need
both hands for your tissues.

06:07.429 --> 06:09.462
I know. Usually, these milestone moments

06:09.497 --> 06:11.464
make me bawl my eyes out,
but I have a trick.

06:11.499 --> 06:14.233
I read that if you pinch
your ear really hard,

06:14.269 --> 06:16.169
the pain distracts you from crying.

06:16.204 --> 06:17.503
Here we come!

06:17.539 --> 06:20.206
Wow!

06:23.278 --> 06:26.446
You both look so beautiful. Ow!

06:28.283 --> 06:29.615
It worked.

06:31.453 --> 06:33.286
Hey, Blake.

06:33.321 --> 06:34.554
My name is Jimmy.

06:34.589 --> 06:36.489
Not tonight, it isn't.

06:36.524 --> 06:38.324
Can I still be Wyatt?

06:38.359 --> 06:41.561
Yes. I love it.
Wyatt, the name, not you.

06:41.596 --> 06:45.498
I mean, I'd never use the word
love on our first official date.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.667
Ooh, that corsage for me?

06:47.702 --> 06:50.403
I love it... and there I go again.

06:52.474 --> 06:54.440
Oh, and you...

06:54.476 --> 06:56.342
You look so handsome.

06:57.579 --> 06:59.445
Thanks?

06:59.481 --> 07:01.481
I'll go get the boutonnières
from the fridge.

07:01.516 --> 07:03.516
Last formal, Beast only ate one of them,

07:03.551 --> 07:06.152
so fingers crossed.

07:07.222 --> 07:09.522
- Ow.
- Sorry.

07:09.557 --> 07:12.358
That coffee table's
taken a piece out of all of us.

07:12.393 --> 07:15.228
I dropped my contact lenses
down the sink this morning.

07:15.263 --> 07:16.496
I can't see anything without them.

07:16.531 --> 07:18.464
Well, don't you have glasses?

07:18.500 --> 07:21.267
Yeah, but I'm afraid
Georgie won't like them.

07:24.372 --> 07:26.506
Uh, they look fine. You're good.

07:26.541 --> 07:29.509
Oh, great. I'll put
them on after pictures.

07:37.685 --> 07:40.286
On second thought, lose the glasses.

07:40.321 --> 07:41.454
Yeah.

07:41.489 --> 07:44.590
Okay, you guys. Time for the big reveal.

07:44.626 --> 07:47.193
You all remember the "before."

07:47.228 --> 07:49.262
Just get to it!

07:49.297 --> 07:52.662
May I present... the "after"?

07:54.000 --> 08:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:04.579 --> 08:06.412
You look beautiful.

08:08.616 --> 08:11.450
Tom, it's not working.
I'm getting emotional.

08:11.486 --> 08:14.220
Oh, I forgot to sign Daphne up for camp,

08:14.255 --> 08:15.621
so she's gonna be around all summer.

08:15.657 --> 08:18.624
That hurts worse than the ear pinch.
Thank you.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.193
I can't believe my little girl

08:21.229 --> 08:23.296
is going to her first formal.

08:23.331 --> 08:25.398
I can't believe she's going
with an older boy.

08:25.433 --> 08:28.442
Dad, Josh and I are just friends.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.028
Just friends. Huh.
I know what that means,

08:31.053 --> 08:33.769
and I'm gonna make sure this guy
knows that it's not gonna mean

08:33.794 --> 08:36.207
what I know it means.

08:37.345 --> 08:40.246
Hi. I'm Josh. Is Harley here?

08:47.423 --> 08:50.749
Josh, what... a surprise.

08:50.774 --> 08:52.406
Not that you're here.

08:52.451 --> 08:53.650
You're supposed to be here.

08:53.685 --> 08:55.167
As my date.

08:55.192 --> 08:57.788
Like we disc... How old are you?

08:57.823 --> 08:59.689
I'm nine. And a half.

09:03.529 --> 09:05.328
I don't know what you're seeing,

09:05.364 --> 09:07.397
but he's really little.

09:07.432 --> 09:09.566
Mom, did you set us up
for a playdate again?

09:09.601 --> 09:11.735
You're kind of overdressed for camping.

09:14.706 --> 09:16.640
You didn't know I skipped
a couple of grades, did you?

09:16.675 --> 09:19.709
No. The periodic table
message you sent back

09:19.745 --> 09:22.379
said "sure," not "I'm nine and a half."

09:22.414 --> 09:24.347
Oh, I'm sorry, Harley.

09:24.383 --> 09:25.682
We've been emailing so long,

09:25.717 --> 09:27.450
I felt like we were old friends.

09:27.486 --> 09:29.619
I guess it slipped my mind.

09:29.655 --> 09:30.654
I hope this isn't a problem.

09:30.689 --> 09:31.822
No.

09:34.493 --> 09:36.493
Of course it's a problem.

09:36.528 --> 09:38.829
I'm going to my first formal
with the guy who's...

09:38.864 --> 09:41.364
less than this many.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.366
No problem at all.

09:44.837 --> 09:46.703
All right, that's the limo. Let's go.

09:46.738 --> 09:49.606
Hopefully, it has a car seat.

09:58.851 --> 10:01.585
Finally, a place where
we can live how we want.

10:01.620 --> 10:02.719
Camp chair?

10:02.754 --> 10:04.521
Don't mind if I do.

10:08.894 --> 10:11.561
Ah, the comforts of home.

10:11.597 --> 10:13.530
Too early to bring out the jawbreakers?

10:13.565 --> 10:15.565
I don't think so.

10:16.735 --> 10:18.835
You wanna start or finish?

10:18.871 --> 10:21.705
You can go ahead. I need to warm up.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.549
Oh, hi, neighbor.

10:32.584 --> 10:33.884
Nice night for camping.

10:38.590 --> 10:40.657
I really hope Harley's doing okay.

10:40.692 --> 10:42.826
She'll be fine. I think
the important thing here

10:42.861 --> 10:46.563
is that I'm doing okay now that I
know she's out with a nine-year-old.

10:46.598 --> 10:48.732
No one wants to camp if you're out here!

10:48.767 --> 10:51.635
Ah, and that right there
is the sound of us

10:51.670 --> 10:53.670
going to bed early.

10:53.705 --> 10:56.673
A mountain lion couldn't
get them in here faster.

11:06.885 --> 11:08.818
I'm sorry. Those guys are jerks.

11:08.854 --> 11:11.454
Who cares? There's a dessert buffet.

11:11.490 --> 11:13.490
I'm not supposed to have
sugar after 8:00,

11:13.525 --> 11:14.724
but you only live once.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.793
Based on tonight,

11:16.828 --> 11:18.428
that might be once too many.

11:18.463 --> 11:19.729
Hey, how's it going with Josh?

11:19.765 --> 11:22.766
He's a nice kid, but this is rough.

11:22.801 --> 11:26.503
Hello! Sir, can I get a cake
pop over here? My turn!

11:26.538 --> 11:28.638
I'm giving it an hour,
and then I'm out of here.

11:28.674 --> 11:30.507
Good idea.

11:30.542 --> 11:31.775
Kids can get cranky past their bedtime.

11:31.810 --> 11:34.544
Seriously? Your date's a turntable.

11:34.579 --> 11:35.679
Also older than your date.

11:35.714 --> 11:36.846
Yep, that's correct.

11:36.882 --> 11:39.582
Ooh, there's Kendra.

11:39.618 --> 11:41.518
I've got her favorite song all cued up.

11:41.553 --> 11:43.520
I saw it on her web page.

11:43.555 --> 11:45.622
Also, her dog's name is Kyle.

11:45.657 --> 11:47.590
Or Karl.

11:47.626 --> 11:49.826
I was looking through
binoculars from across the room.

11:49.861 --> 11:51.695
There's a story you can tell your kids.

11:51.730 --> 11:53.797
Okay, guys, I wanna get to the photos,

11:53.832 --> 11:56.433
so I can start working
the room for the queen vote.

11:56.468 --> 11:58.668
Also, Mom said if we
come home without group shots,

11:58.704 --> 12:01.438
she's not paying for the limo.

12:11.483 --> 12:13.750
Oh, you can go in front of me.

12:15.721 --> 12:16.820
You, too.

12:16.855 --> 12:19.456
You've been in line for the bathroom

12:19.491 --> 12:20.590
for 20 minutes.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.525
Twenty-two minutes and 36 seconds.

12:22.561 --> 12:23.693
I don't even have to go.

12:23.729 --> 12:25.462
I'm just trying to wait out the clock

12:25.497 --> 12:26.796
until I can leave without being a jerk.

12:26.832 --> 12:28.631
Harley!

12:28.667 --> 12:30.567
Last fruit tart. Splitsies?

12:32.804 --> 12:34.571
Good for you.

12:34.606 --> 12:37.674
Maybe next year, you'll be
coming with someone like Wyatt.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.776
Someone you're into,
who's totally into you...

12:39.811 --> 12:41.878
Wait, who is that girl he's talking to?

12:41.913 --> 12:44.781
I'm so happy to be here
with you, Georgie.

12:51.757 --> 12:54.591
You really think this will work?

12:54.626 --> 12:56.693
Definitely. Daphne's
not gonna wanna camp

12:56.728 --> 12:58.461
next to two pigs.

12:58.497 --> 12:59.896
Hit her with full can of soda.

13:02.634 --> 13:04.801
Okay, enough toying around.

13:04.836 --> 13:06.603
Let's get serious.

13:06.638 --> 13:08.705
Hit her with the Chinese food buffet.

13:12.644 --> 13:15.445
Wow! I can almost smell that one.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.747
That oughta bounce her right outta here.

13:22.854 --> 13:24.621
Daphne doesn't have a phone.

13:24.656 --> 13:26.856
Dang. You've gotta admire
something like that.

13:26.892 --> 13:29.459
Okay, we've gotta end this.

13:33.532 --> 13:35.498
Daphne, this is our camping night.

13:35.534 --> 13:36.800
Don't make us come in there.

13:36.835 --> 13:39.702
Do you smell cookies?

13:39.738 --> 13:41.738
Peanut butter.

13:41.773 --> 13:43.740
Chocolate chips.

13:43.775 --> 13:46.743
Correction. White chocolate chips.

13:48.513 --> 13:50.480
Warm, delicious cookies.

13:50.515 --> 13:54.717
Handmade with love, straight
out of my Tiny Bake oven.

13:54.753 --> 13:57.821
What?!

13:57.856 --> 14:00.390
We see what you're trying to do.

14:00.425 --> 14:02.826
Trying to lure us in
with your comfy tent,

14:02.861 --> 14:05.395
and your cookies
and your whoopie-less cushions.

14:05.430 --> 14:06.696
It's not gonna work, sister.

14:06.731 --> 14:09.432
I have also downloaded
six hours of Dumpster Jack

14:09.468 --> 14:11.468
on Rachel's computer.

14:11.503 --> 14:14.437
It's like she can see into our souls.

14:15.674 --> 14:18.808
The second we set foot
into that tent, she wins.

14:18.844 --> 14:21.744
But if we go back to our tent,

14:21.780 --> 14:23.746
and don't watch Dumpster Jack,

14:23.782 --> 14:26.549
and don't have cookies,

14:26.585 --> 14:28.518
she also wins.

14:28.553 --> 14:31.554
Beast, we have no other choice.

14:31.590 --> 14:34.491
We must surrender with dignity.

14:34.526 --> 14:35.658
What do you think?

14:35.694 --> 14:37.460
Agreed.

14:43.535 --> 14:46.703
Georgie, maybe it's
too soon to bring this up,

14:46.738 --> 14:48.705
but I feel like I know you so well.

14:48.740 --> 14:52.542
Oh, tell me, Blake, you're a guy.

14:52.577 --> 14:54.711
Why is Wyatt talking to
all these other girls,

14:54.746 --> 14:56.746
when I invited him to this dance?

14:56.781 --> 14:58.815
I don't know.
Why is Rachel calling me Blake

14:58.850 --> 15:00.650
- when I'm Jimmy?
- Sorry about that, Jimmy Blake.

15:00.685 --> 15:02.519
Thank you.

15:02.554 --> 15:05.755
Hm, sippy cup. Gotta give 'em props.

15:05.790 --> 15:08.391
Where do you find one of these
things at a high school dance?

15:08.426 --> 15:11.694
Yep, that's good use of creativity.

15:11.730 --> 15:13.796
Listen, why don't we take
that table by the teachers?

15:13.832 --> 15:15.598
Nobody will try anything there.

15:24.709 --> 15:29.579
<i> This one goes out to Harley
Diaz and her special guest.</i>

15:38.823 --> 15:40.823
Go to the bathroom for five seconds.

15:40.859 --> 15:42.559
Sorry, Harley.

15:48.451 --> 15:50.463
Doesn't seem like you're
having a lot of fun.

15:50.526 --> 15:53.527
No. I totally am.

15:53.580 --> 15:57.748
This has been the best... 51
minutes, 43 seconds of my life.

16:01.621 --> 16:03.387
Hey, somebody dropped a 20.

16:08.728 --> 16:10.628
Wait a second.

16:10.663 --> 16:13.431
Are you doing that?

16:13.466 --> 16:14.732
That's awesome!

16:14.767 --> 16:16.534
That's what I like about inventing.

16:16.569 --> 16:19.270
I mean, it puts me in the driver's seat,

16:19.305 --> 16:21.305
which legally, I'm not gonna
be able to do

16:21.341 --> 16:23.441
for seven more years.

16:23.476 --> 16:26.310
I get that.

16:26.346 --> 16:29.313
In my family, if I want
control, I have to invent it.

16:29.349 --> 16:32.316
In a family of nine, the only
thing I can count on is chaos.

16:32.352 --> 16:35.353
Well, that, and the toilet
paper roll always being empty.

16:36.389 --> 16:37.555
Can I give it a test drive?

17:06.685 --> 17:08.419
You're not gonna believe this.

17:08.454 --> 17:09.720
They're in Daphne's tent.

17:09.756 --> 17:13.257
At this rate, they're gonna
be out there all night.

17:13.292 --> 17:16.327
I have an idea.

17:16.362 --> 17:18.396
It's not gonna win us
any parenting awards.

17:18.431 --> 17:20.330
Uh, that's okay.

17:20.366 --> 17:22.333
We weren't nominated anyway.

17:23.435 --> 17:25.736
Okay, Tom, hit the sprinklers.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.708
Zone Two. It's supposed to be Zone Two!

17:30.743 --> 17:32.677
May I top off your moo juice?

17:32.712 --> 17:34.445
You know it.

17:38.618 --> 17:40.751
Is it raining outside?

17:40.787 --> 17:43.387
- No.
- Probably not.

17:43.423 --> 17:46.390
You guys gotta get out of here.

17:46.426 --> 17:49.594
I thought so, too, but
we're actually having fun.

17:49.629 --> 17:52.763
No, I just found out a bunch of kids got
together and voted you king and queen.

17:52.799 --> 17:55.566
Cool. I can rock a crown.

17:55.602 --> 17:57.435
You don't understand.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.437
This means you two
have to do the spotlight dance.

17:59.472 --> 18:02.240
Together, under the spotlight.

18:11.651 --> 18:12.717
<i> Nine and a half.</i>

18:12.752 --> 18:15.486
<i>Nine and a half.</i>

18:20.560 --> 18:22.593
I'll call the limo.

18:22.629 --> 18:24.629
Hey, before we leave,

18:24.664 --> 18:27.498
I just wanna say thanks.

18:27.533 --> 18:30.334
- I had a blast tonight.
- You did?

18:30.370 --> 18:32.336
Yeah. I mean, it's not like
I'm gonna have

18:32.372 --> 18:33.571
a lot of big high school moments.

18:33.606 --> 18:35.273
At the rate I'm going,

18:35.308 --> 18:36.707
I'll graduate when I'm 11.

18:36.743 --> 18:39.377
Do you know anybody who
wants to go to their senior prom

18:39.412 --> 18:40.711
with an 11-year-old?

18:43.616 --> 18:46.284
You know what?

18:46.319 --> 18:47.518
We're not going anywhere.

18:47.553 --> 18:51.555
My friend is getting
his big high school moment.

18:51.591 --> 18:53.624
We are going to do that spotlight dance,

18:53.660 --> 18:56.460
- and we are going to kill it.
- We are? How?

18:56.496 --> 18:58.429
I have no idea.

18:58.464 --> 19:00.464
But we're both inventors.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.334
We just have to get creative.

19:03.369 --> 19:04.602
Georgie, every time I've
tried to talk to you tonight,

19:04.637 --> 19:06.437
you've run away.

19:06.472 --> 19:08.439
But I just want you to know,
I think you're great.

19:08.474 --> 19:11.676
The two of us vibe so well together.

19:11.711 --> 19:13.444
What I'm trying to say is,

19:13.479 --> 19:16.280
I want us to be a thing-thing.

19:16.316 --> 19:19.650
You want to be a thing-thing
with my geometry teacher?

19:19.686 --> 19:21.352
- Who are you?
- Georgie.

19:21.387 --> 19:22.420
Then who is that?

19:22.455 --> 19:23.521
Mrs. Wilkins.

19:23.556 --> 19:26.457
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

19:26.492 --> 19:28.626
I lost my contact lenses; I can't see.

19:28.661 --> 19:30.394
Wait.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.364
Do you wanna be a thing?

19:33.399 --> 19:35.700
I would love that.

19:35.735 --> 19:38.502
Love. I did it again.

19:38.538 --> 19:41.372
But we're a thing now. I can say that.

19:41.407 --> 19:42.673
Georgie, I need you.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.475
Not the time. Having a thing.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.544
They're voting me and Josh
for the spotlight dance.

19:48.715 --> 19:50.581
It's gonna take a whole lotta work

19:50.616 --> 19:52.416
to turn this thing around.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.485
Luckily, I've got a whole lotta family.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.653
Come on.

19:57.490 --> 19:59.557
Okay, I'm about to say
a bunch of weird stuff.

19:59.592 --> 20:01.459
Don't ask questions, just do it.

20:01.494 --> 20:03.394
Georgie, I need you
to tell the limo driver

20:03.429 --> 20:04.662
to point his headlights

20:04.697 --> 20:06.497
- toward the tent.
- On it.

20:06.532 --> 20:09.433
- Wyatt, I need a bunch of balloons.
- Coming up.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.703
Rachel, lose the sign over there.

20:12.739 --> 20:14.405
Come on, Jimmy. We have a job to do.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.573
I thought I was Blake.

20:15.608 --> 20:17.775
This is more of a Jimmy job.

20:19.712 --> 20:21.645
Ethan, I need
the perfect song for a dance.

20:21.681 --> 20:23.647
I know exactly the one.

20:23.683 --> 20:27.385
I was saving it for Kendra,
but if you need it, it's yours.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.686
Thanks.

20:29.756 --> 20:32.690
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:32.725 --> 20:34.725
the moment you have
all been waiting for.

20:34.761 --> 20:39.530
This year's spring formal
king and queen are...

20:39.565 --> 20:42.666
Josh Durman and Harley Diaz!

20:46.406 --> 20:47.772
It's time for the spotlight dance.

20:47.807 --> 20:49.540
Hit it, Georgie.

20:51.677 --> 20:58.416
♪ Lights go down
and then the curtains rise ♪

21:01.354 --> 21:09.760

22:09.589 --> 22:11.722
Thanks for saving our butts.

22:11.757 --> 22:13.324
Sorry you didn't get to be queen.

22:13.359 --> 22:15.459
It's okay. I don't want to be

22:15.495 --> 22:17.561
queen of anyone who would
treat my sister that way.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.597
Besides, the dance committee
blew their budget

22:19.632 --> 22:21.565
on space heaters,
so there's no glitter rain.

22:26.372 --> 22:27.738
<i> I was right.</i>

22:27.773 --> 22:29.707
<i>The first dance
with your siblings there,</i>

22:29.742 --> 22:31.575
<i>super awkward.</i>

22:31.611 --> 22:33.611
<i>But without them,</i>

22:33.646 --> 22:36.647
<i>it never would've gone
from awkward to awesome.</i>

22:36.682 --> 22:38.415
TOM: What's that?

22:38.451 --> 22:41.519
Oh, now Zone Two goes off.
