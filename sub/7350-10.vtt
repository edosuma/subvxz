WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:07.475
*

00:18.386 --> 00:21.289
One more lap,
and I am off the clock.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.524
MAN:
And onto Gina.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.126
Isabelle.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.427
A yoga teacher from Austin.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.428
Oh.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.398
Man, that chick is so flexible.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.399
Mm.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.068
She can touch her nose to her...

00:34.102 --> 00:35.469
To her what?

00:35.503 --> 00:37.738
I got to go.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.618
WOMAN:
Someone's coming.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.785
What?

00:51.819 --> 00:54.755
What are the two of
you doing in here?

00:54.788 --> 00:57.125
WOMAN:
We... we were just...

00:57.158 --> 00:58.659
Making history.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.499
Uh, s-step out of the exhibit.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.535
Huh?
Now!

01:22.416 --> 01:24.285
We got a problem.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.124
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:30.158 --> 01:32.560
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:32.593 --> 01:35.263
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:35.296 --> 01:36.564
* How, how, how, how

01:36.597 --> 01:38.599
* Hey, hey

01:44.572 --> 01:46.140
* You gotta come on.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.548
And you know
I been at this a month.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.518
Tried everything--
our database, FBI's.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.388
Nothing more I can do.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.523
I know, it's tough on all of us.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.492
You try to get some sleep, okay?

02:04.525 --> 02:06.260
Yeah, I got to let you go.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.761
Talk to you tomorrow.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.230
Love you, Mom.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.498
Bye.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.167
Checking in with mom?
Yep.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.336
Bet you guys have big
plans for the holiday.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.171
Eh, not so much.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.339
It's Christmas.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.673
I'm well aware.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.343
Got a nifty little
calendar app on my phone.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.279
Christmas is a holiday.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.615
You're firing on all cylinders
today, ain't you, Brody?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.783
Lasalle, you live for holidays.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.519
You celebrate Halloween
for an entire week.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.554
I mean, Thanksgiving is like
an episode of Top Chef.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.690
And don't even get me started
about Fourth of July.

02:36.724 --> 02:40.394
What, you didn't like the,
uh, Uncle Sam costume?

02:40.428 --> 02:43.397
You're a holiday junkie.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.367
And-and Christmas
is the mother of them all.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.802
Sorry to disappoint you, Brody.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.871
Christmas just ain't my thing.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.342
Christopher, Brody.
What do we got?

02:54.375 --> 02:57.411
Annual holiday mixer
for military personnel.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.313
According to his statement,
the security guard

02:59.347 --> 03:01.582
was making his rounds
when he came across the victim

03:01.615 --> 03:04.252
in this closed-off section.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.819
PRIDE:
Good tidings, Loretta.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.721
Not for this
particular fella.

03:07.755 --> 03:12.626
The victim is retired SEAL
William Samuels, age 54.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.330
Broken guard rail.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.931
Knocked over replicas.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.501
Based on the diameter
of the wound...

03:20.534 --> 03:22.370
gonna venture to say

03:22.403 --> 03:24.272
he was stabbed in the abdomen
with that knife.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.740
Looks like a...

03:26.774 --> 03:28.609
bayonet, actually.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.312
Approximate time of
death: two hours ago.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.813
8:30.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.316
Right in the middle
of the event.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.318
That's a serious party foul.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.655
Tread mark in the fake snow.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.894
Make a cast and send it over
to Sebastian to analyze.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.334
Seal of honor?

03:55.803 --> 03:58.372
I know that pin.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.341
That's Bud
the Imposter Hunter.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.042
Who's Bud the Imposter Hunter?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.378
Good men and women
risk their lives

04:04.412 --> 04:06.013
each and every day
for this country,

04:06.046 --> 04:07.781
and these lowlife imposters

04:07.815 --> 04:10.551
come in and hijack
their heroism.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.786
Got a call from a lady
in Shreveport.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.789
Neighbor was a so-called
decorated Marine who incurred

04:15.823 --> 04:18.759
a nasty spinal injury--
collected

04:18.792 --> 04:21.962
close to 80 grand
in veterans disability

04:21.995 --> 04:24.298
benefits to cover medical costs.

04:24.332 --> 04:28.068
So imagine the gal's surprise
when she stumbles upon him

04:28.101 --> 04:30.738
teaching a martial arts class.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.442
This jerk was discharged
before he ever got deployed.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.478
I called a contact
at the Veterans Admin

04:37.511 --> 04:39.480
and shut his imposter ass down.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.883
So, all you phonies out there,

04:42.916 --> 04:46.487
the next time you think about
calling yourself a hero,

04:46.520 --> 04:48.656
think again, 'cause
Bud the Imposter Hunter

04:48.689 --> 04:50.691
is out there looking for you.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.464
Question is:
how did Bud the hunter

04:56.497 --> 04:58.766
become Bud the hunted?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.445
Here you go, Addie.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.046
Thank you.
Appreciate you
helping us out.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.548
My pleasure.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.684
As the Navy liaison
for stolen valor crimes,

05:16.717 --> 05:19.387
I had the honor of working
with Bud on a handful of cases.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.889
So military fraud
is common for the Navy?

05:21.922 --> 05:25.526
It's become a widespread issue
among all the Armed Forces.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.928
So much so that,
in 2013, Congress passed

05:27.961 --> 05:30.564
the Stolen Valor Act
to clamp down on it.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.000
So these guys pretend to be
in the service for what?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.602
Glory, respect?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.770
Not to mention some significant
financial perks--

05:36.804 --> 05:39.540
higher job salaries,
free goods and services

05:39.573 --> 05:42.109
and thousands
in pensions and benefits.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.545
Wouldn't be surprised if some of
these fakes held a grudge

05:44.578 --> 05:47.581
against Bud for
exposing their scams.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.417
The first thing we
need to do is separate

05:49.450 --> 05:51.519
the G.I. Joes from
the G.I. Fauxs.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.655
I can put a list together of all
the cases Bud and I worked on,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.824
see if there's anyone
who raises a red flag.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.661
Good. Uh, we'll cross-reference
potential suspects with

06:00.694 --> 06:03.497
the security footage from the
party, see if we get a hit.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.599
You know that's my desk,
don't you, Watkins?

06:05.633 --> 06:08.502
Relax, Lasalle. I don't
take up that much room.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.505
Brody, help these two
work it out.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.642
I got a date with the
dynamic duo over at the morgue.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.714
Someone's in
the yuletide spirit.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.684
Saturnalia, actually.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.587
It's a pagan festival celebrated
in ancient Rome.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.655
Did you know that

06:27.688 --> 06:29.056
during Saturnalia,
Romans would go

06:29.089 --> 06:31.124
from house to house
singing in the nude?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.694
It was a precursor to our
modern-day Christmas caroling.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.863
Can we save this for the...
Office holiday party.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.831
Yeah, the thing is I haven't
gotten my invite for that yet.

06:37.865 --> 06:38.832
I keep checking...

06:38.866 --> 06:39.767
Sebastian.
What?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.035
You have some information
you want to share?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.303
I do. That's a
great call. Yes.

06:43.336 --> 06:47.675
I, uh, cross-referenced the
boot print from the crime scene

06:47.708 --> 06:50.511
with all military-issue
boots in the last ten years.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.446
No match. But...

06:52.480 --> 06:54.147
when I ran the tread
through the commercial database,

06:54.181 --> 06:55.649
I found these.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.486
They're cheap knockoffs.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.521
Kind of like the sneakers

07:00.554 --> 07:02.923
my mom bought for me
for my 12th birthday.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.759
See, I had asked
for Adidas, right?

07:05.793 --> 07:08.629
But instead, Mom takes a Sharpie
to a pair of her nursing shoes.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.130
And it's like, Earth to Mom.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.466
You know, Adidas have
three stripes, not four.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.167
Stay with me.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.670
The boots your killer
was wearing are the ten-inch

07:16.704 --> 07:19.172
desert combat boots, made by
that bastion of style,

07:19.206 --> 07:22.009
Chinese manufacturer Wee-San.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.679
They retail
for about 183 yuan.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.982
That's about $29.99.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.183
Thanks, buddy.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.520
You got it, friend.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.122
Check your Evite.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.157
WADE:
Upon opening Bud's

07:37.190 --> 07:40.093
abdominal cavity,
I found several organs were

07:40.127 --> 07:43.030
severely damaged
by the bayonet blade

07:43.063 --> 07:45.799
being moved transversely
within the body.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.868
Meaning this wasn't
a quick stab-and-run.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.538
Killer probably twisted
the blade back and forth

07:50.571 --> 07:52.005
after he stabbed Bud?

07:52.039 --> 07:55.876
That's what I thought, until...

07:55.909 --> 07:58.078
I found this lovely sight.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.880
PRIDE:
Ouch.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.582
In most stabbings,
you don't see

08:01.615 --> 08:05.018
such severe bruising because
of the rapid blood loss.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.754
But the discoloration here
indicates

08:06.787 --> 08:08.956
several hours of
internal bleeding.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.858
What I couldn't
figure out was why.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.561
That's when I
realized that perhaps

08:13.594 --> 08:16.597
the victim wasn't
stabbed by the bayonet,

08:16.630 --> 08:18.131
but instead...

08:18.165 --> 08:19.266
impaled.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.268
You see...

08:23.270 --> 08:25.272
...if the bayonet had merely

08:25.305 --> 08:27.975
punctured the victim's
blood vessels,

08:28.008 --> 08:31.211
it would cause a rapid flow
of blood from the exit wound,

08:31.244 --> 08:32.946
like this.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.552
But if the victim was

08:38.586 --> 08:40.253
impaled by the bayonet,

08:40.287 --> 08:43.290
it would exert
enough force on the vessels

08:43.323 --> 08:46.894
to actually stop the bleeding.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.598
So Bud and the killer fought.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.767
Bud goes crashing through
the guard railing,

08:53.801 --> 08:55.736
lands on the bayonet.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.839
At which point, the victim
struggles for hours

08:58.872 --> 09:01.174
to free himself from the weapon.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.076
So, while I was correct

09:03.110 --> 09:05.646
that he died between
8:00 and 9:00 p.m...

09:05.679 --> 09:07.080
He was assaulted earlier.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.716
Somewhere between
noon and 4:00.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.250
You may have a gingerbread.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.723
You're welcome.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.826
We've been looking at the wrong
part of the security tape.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.761
According to Pride,

09:20.794 --> 09:24.297
Bud was attacked by his
killer as early as 12:00 p.m.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.166
Museum opens at 1100.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.168
What was the schedule
of events that day?

09:28.201 --> 09:32.239
The American Legion had a
gift drive from noon to 3:00.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.007
I'll start downloading
security cam files

09:34.041 --> 09:35.876
from earlier in the day.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.612
We'll refresh the caffeine.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.351
What's up with this whole

09:44.384 --> 09:46.353
"Lasalle hates Christmas" thing?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.255
You've known him a while;
you tell me.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.190
Couple years--
I mean,

09:50.223 --> 09:52.860
wouldn't say I have the
inside track on him or anything.

09:52.893 --> 09:56.029
Chris is a great guy.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.399
He's funny, smart,
easy on the eyes.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.134
But?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.804
He acts like
he's this open book.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.639
Half the time,
I can't read him.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.408
LASALLE:
I found him.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.643
2:22.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.144
WATKINS:
There's our hunter.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.113
BRODY: Let's see if
he finds his prey.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.751
There he is--
the east overhead.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.387
Zoom in.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.222
Seems to be having...

10:22.255 --> 10:25.092
some sort of confrontation
with this guy.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.261
There.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.931
Bud followed him
into the roped-off area.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.332
Can you get closer?

10:32.365 --> 10:33.734
Yep.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.002
Come on now.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.837
Real blurry.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.706
Think Bruce can handle it?

10:38.739 --> 10:39.907
Watch and learn, sister.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.380
Attaboy.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.717
Len Bowers.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.753
Well, look what
we got here.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.021
From Bud's files.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.089
BRODY: He's got a
downtown address.

10:56.123 --> 11:00.060
Fifth floor apartment's
rented to a Trish Parker.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.430
Wonder if Trish knows she's
shacking up with a charlatan.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.070
Something's burning.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.048
:
It's cold.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.886
Ready?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.054
NCIS!

11:28.488 --> 11:29.757
Hands in the air!

11:29.790 --> 11:30.791
Baby, run!

11:31.792 --> 11:32.826
No! No!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.363
Leave him alone!

11:54.882 --> 11:56.884
*

12:17.104 --> 12:19.206
Baby, get on!

12:28.215 --> 12:30.183
What the hell?

12:31.952 --> 12:34.387
All right, BOLO's out
on Bonnie and Clyde.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.389
Meantime, what do we know?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.158
According to
Bud's file,

12:38.191 --> 12:40.994
Len Bowers was rejected
from the forces three times

12:41.028 --> 12:42.830
for failing
his physical.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.333
That's when he decided to enlist
in the make-believe military.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.368
BRODY: Started showing up
at events and social media sites

12:48.401 --> 12:50.537
claiming to be
a decorated Marine.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.274
Apparently, he met Backwoods
Barbie on SoldierMingle.com.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.276
BRODY: Clearly,
Trish was trying

12:56.309 --> 12:58.812
to burn any evidence
connecting Len with the crime.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.584
Explosive Ordnance Disposal.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.854
Navy bomb tech.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.089
Those guys are the real deal.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.557
So's the jacket.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.960
DoD identification
number.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.528
Have Addie run the number
through DEIDS.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.198
All right? See if she can
figure out who it belongs to.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.532
It looks like

13:19.566 --> 13:23.003
Len and Trish was planning
a romantic getaway.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.206
Checked the Greyhound schedule
less than an hour ago.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.941
Must be dozens of buses
running across the Gulf

13:27.975 --> 13:29.142
at any given time.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.945
64, to be exact.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.047
Put an alert out
to local authorities.

13:34.081 --> 13:37.017
Eyes on at every station.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.020
Huh.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.255
Let me guess.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.429
Wee-San.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.535
If you guys will just be patient
for a few more moments.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.439
Agent Pride, this is
Marshall and Liza Chase.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.640
Jacket you found
in that apartment

14:00.673 --> 14:01.674
was issued to
their son Zack.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.377
Nice to meet you folks.
When I checked their son's

14:04.411 --> 14:07.214
OMPF file, he was listed as
Duty Status Whereabouts Unknown,

14:07.247 --> 14:09.149
at which point
I contacted the...

14:09.182 --> 14:11.919
My wife and I want to know
why you're asking about Zack.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.153
Marsh, please.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.555
PRIDE:
Mr. and Mrs. Chase,

14:15.588 --> 14:17.390
we believe your son

14:17.424 --> 14:20.227
may be indirectly involved
in a case we're investigating.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.895
That's impossible.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.432
Our son was killed in
Afghanistan almost a year ago.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.072
This is Zack.

14:32.105 --> 14:36.076
He was on a mission in
Afghanistan clearing land mines.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.578
There was an accident.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.647
An abandoned building exploded.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.650
It was the last time
anyone saw our son.

14:43.683 --> 14:47.420
ISAF troops searched
extensively for Zack's remains.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.457
They recovered traces
of skin and bone fragment

14:50.490 --> 14:51.959
that matched his DNA.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.361
We're... we're very sorry.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.997
We-we didn't...

14:57.030 --> 14:59.166
Zack died doing
what he loved best.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.936
Said there was nothing better
than watching a displaced family

15:02.970 --> 15:04.037
go home

15:04.071 --> 15:05.572
after he made it safe for them.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.108
Must've made you proud.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.609
Mm, he did.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.245
Sure gave us a run for our money
as a kid though.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.447
Climbing on roofs,

15:14.481 --> 15:15.949
falling out of trees.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.185
He was our little
Tasmanian devil.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.187
Taz.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.355
Name kind of stuck.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.058
Mr. and Mrs. Chase,
we're trying to figure out

15:25.092 --> 15:29.362
how your son's jacket got into
the hands of a murder suspect.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.732
I can tell you how.
It's not his.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.136
You all said this guy
was a... was a phony.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.138
The jacket's got
to be fake, too.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.240
But if there was a chance...

15:40.273 --> 15:41.341
Damn it, Liza.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.412
Our son is gone.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.580
At some point,

15:47.614 --> 15:50.950
we got to close the book,
try and move on.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.223
May I see it?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.659
The jacket.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.720
Celtic shield knot?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.722
For protection.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.324
Sewed one into Taz's jacket

16:31.358 --> 16:32.692
when he got deployed.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.227
It's his, Marshall.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.030
It means
somebody found his body.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.566
Please,
if there's any information

16:39.599 --> 16:41.534
on our son's death...

16:41.568 --> 16:46.506
We'll do whatever it takes
to help you find closure.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.408
I promise you that.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.231
It's a risky move,

17:11.264 --> 17:14.534
promising
that family answers.

17:17.437 --> 17:20.440
It's all a little close
to home for you, huh?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.210
Yeah, I gave that a...

17:23.243 --> 17:26.446
another shot.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.216
Same thing.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.351
Just caused my family pain.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.619
I'm sorry.

17:32.652 --> 17:36.389
I know what they're
going through, King.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.825
I mean...

17:38.858 --> 17:43.396
every time
that couple hits that wall...

17:43.430 --> 17:46.366
it's like they're losing
their son all over again.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.001
Sebastian just texted.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.271
He got something
off Bowers' boot.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.305
Yeah, right there.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.276
Brody and I will

17:56.309 --> 17:57.277
focus on finding Len Bowers,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.479
figure out how he got his hands
on that jacket.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.813
You take Addie.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.616
Start looking back
into Zack's case.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.418
King, I'm not sure...
Learn things.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.688
It'll do you good.

18:16.629 --> 18:20.333
We'd swept half the village
for explosives,

18:20.367 --> 18:22.535
but it was getting dark.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.538
So... had to call it a day.

18:25.572 --> 18:29.142
Decided to head back
to the F.O.B.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.478
That was when Zack said

18:31.511 --> 18:34.781
he saw someone
wander into the red zone.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.784
I've told all of this

18:37.817 --> 18:40.220
to the command investigators
already.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.888
We understand. We're
just trying to figure out

18:41.921 --> 18:45.658
how Petty Officer Chase's jacket
could have survived the blast.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.461
I...

18:48.495 --> 18:51.664
tried to stop him
from going back.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.800
But Zack...

18:53.833 --> 18:55.735
wouldn't listen.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.571
Next thing I know,
there's

18:58.605 --> 19:00.707
a crazy explosion.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.243
White light knocked me
clear on my ass.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.677
Taylor, can
you remember

19:04.711 --> 19:06.346
if Zack had on his tech jacket

19:06.379 --> 19:08.181
before he went back
in that building?

19:09.616 --> 19:13.620
Gone over that day at least
a hundred times in my head,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.889
just trying
to make sense of it all.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.292
Wondering whether there was

19:19.326 --> 19:21.961
something I could've done
different.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.930
But I can say that

19:23.963 --> 19:26.366
Zack was wearing his jacket.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.635
Sure of it.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.838
MAN:
Taylor!

19:31.871 --> 19:33.373
TAYLOR:
If y'all don't mind...

19:33.406 --> 19:35.608
my training partner's
waiting on me.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.743
Of course.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.778
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.313
Good luck.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.350
MAN:
Come on, let's hit it!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.457
SEBASTIAN:
Phloem sap.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.691
Phloem what?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.560
Sap. Like from a tree?

19:53.593 --> 19:55.928
See, while the barbecue flames
managed to broil the better part

19:55.962 --> 19:57.864
of these boots, they didn't
singe off everything.

19:57.897 --> 20:02.469
There was a small speck of sap
on the right sole.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.304
Stubborn bugger held on
even as the heat rose,

20:04.337 --> 20:06.639
which allowed me to run
a particle test, and...

20:06.673 --> 20:09.342
Krakatoa!

20:09.376 --> 20:10.810
Still working
on that catchphrase, huh?

20:10.843 --> 20:13.313
Back to the drawing board.
In any event,

20:13.346 --> 20:16.015
I discovered that the sap came
from a bald cypress tree,

20:16.048 --> 20:17.517
a tree which happens
to be indigenous

20:17.550 --> 20:19.652
to our own Atchafalaya Basin.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.687
Atchafalaya Basin?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.689
That's 337 area code.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.557
There were two calls
placed there

20:24.591 --> 20:25.958
from Trish and Len's apartment.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.528
And, look, there happens to be

20:28.561 --> 20:30.597
a Greyhound bus station
there, too.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.566
Loved the look on her face

20:33.600 --> 20:35.001
when she got
off that bus.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.438
Would've loved it more
if Len Bowers had been there.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.508
Thinking good cop or bad cop?

20:41.541 --> 20:44.444
Thinking... girl cop.

20:51.684 --> 20:55.054
No word from Len yet.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.657
Probably doesn't have reception.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.592
Yeah.

20:59.626 --> 21:03.330
Not a lot places
without cell towers these days.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.997
He'll call.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.633
I know he will.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.502
Look, I get it.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.604
You're in love.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.773
Head over heels,
pit in the stomach,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.508
whole nine yards.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.009
What do you know about it?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.845
Plenty.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.613
Name was James.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.449
Met at a party.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.016
Pretty much inseparable
from the get-go.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.752
One morning, we were
having breakfast.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.654
Poured myself
some Shredded Wheat.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.956
And there it was, sitting
in the middle of my bowl.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.724
Two carats, cushion cut.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.693
He got down on one knee,

21:33.726 --> 21:35.628
told me all the reasons
he loved me,

21:35.662 --> 21:38.698
how he wanted
to grow old with me.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.633
And?
And...

21:40.667 --> 21:42.034
then he was gone.

21:42.068 --> 21:45.772
Where he'd go?

21:45.805 --> 21:48.608
All I can say is,

21:48.641 --> 21:52.044
nothing about James
was what he said it was.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.581
And the worst part?

21:54.614 --> 21:58.451
Deep down...
I knew it all along.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.764
I think you know it, too.

22:15.702 --> 22:16.903
Len's on his way
to Mexico.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.605
Here's the make
and model of the truck

22:18.638 --> 22:20.607
he borrowed from his cousin
to get there.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.575
Yeah, put a BOLO
out on it stat.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.743
Also, alert the border.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.478
Copy that.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.747
Story you told
Trish

22:27.780 --> 22:30.683
May have been a bowl
of Shredded Wheat.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.704
Hands where we can see them.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.889
Thank your girlfriend for
giving us your 20, Len.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.924
Ex-girlfriend,
actually.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.628
It was an accident.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.096
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.765
He just kept
calling me a phony.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.166
He has a name.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.770
Bud Samuels.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.171
And considering you were
impersonating

23:25.204 --> 23:26.739
a United States naval officer?

23:26.773 --> 23:28.775
I tried to serve.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.643
Didn't make the grade.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.779
Said I was defective,
on account of the fact

23:32.812 --> 23:35.548
that I got a stupid
heart murmur.

23:35.582 --> 23:39.051
Then this jerk comes along
rubbing salt in my wounds.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.653
I just snapped.

23:40.687 --> 23:44.624
Snapped is when you punch a guy.

23:44.657 --> 23:48.628
Impaling them to death
is a whole other ball game.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.830
I pushed the guy.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.800
I didn't mean for him
to break through that rail.

23:56.135 --> 24:00.840
When I looked down and I saw
that bayonet through his gut...

24:00.873 --> 24:04.844
got scared, so I ran.

24:06.879 --> 24:11.484
Okay, now that we got
the murder part squared away.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.753
Something else.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.858
We found an EOD jacket
in your apartment.

24:18.891 --> 24:22.061
Belongs to a petty officer
named Zack Chase.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.531
Need to know
where you got the coat.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.065
No reason to help you.

24:26.098 --> 24:29.068
No. No, you sure don't.

24:30.837 --> 24:33.940
And this kid, Chase...

24:35.942 --> 24:39.145
...his family needs answers.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.682
You can help give them some.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.751
This is your
chance here.

24:44.784 --> 24:48.688
Your chance
to be a real hero, Len.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.095
Hameed.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.731
Guy who sold me the jacket.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.870
Find him,
you'll get your answers.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.787
WADE:
I was up all night

25:20.820 --> 25:24.857
trying to make sense of the
Navy's medical examiner's report

25:24.891 --> 25:27.293
on the explosion that killed
Petty Officer Chase.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.628
What's the quandary?

25:28.661 --> 25:31.564
Anti-personnel mines

25:31.598 --> 25:33.600
laid by the Russians
in Afghanistan

25:33.633 --> 25:34.934
were designed to devastate,

25:34.967 --> 25:37.203
not vaporize,

25:37.236 --> 25:40.339
which would leave far more
of the petty officer's DNA

25:40.372 --> 25:42.108
than just traces of

25:42.141 --> 25:44.711
bone fragments and skin.
It just doesn't add up.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.846
I might have something
to contribute to the equation.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.017
Feels like eighth grade science
all over again.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.152
I wouldn't know. I was
taking organic chemistry

25:53.185 --> 25:55.254
at the local
university by then.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.257
While wearing
women's sneakers.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.960
Anyway, this is a mock
explosion using compounds

26:00.993 --> 26:03.195
typically found in a
military-grade land mine.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.733
Safety first.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.701
Fire in the hole.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.805
As you can see, it emits a
black mushroom-like cloud.

26:12.839 --> 26:15.007
But Zack's coworker
Taylor described

26:15.041 --> 26:17.143
the explosion aftermath
as a bright, white light.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.912
Do either of you know what
emits that type of cloud?

26:21.013 --> 26:23.850
Now would be the time
to fill us in, dear.

26:23.883 --> 26:26.719
It's TATP.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.755
It's a chemical
most commonly found

26:28.788 --> 26:30.690
in improvised
explosive devices.

26:30.723 --> 26:33.025
Kind used by insurgents
and terrorists.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.360
Mm-hmm.
WADE:
IED explosion

26:34.393 --> 26:36.328
would be more in line
with the type

26:36.362 --> 26:38.731
of trace evidence found
at the explosion site.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.100
Still doesn't explain what
happened to Zack's body.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.002
What if there was no body?

26:44.303 --> 26:46.172
My theory is that it was moved.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.274
In certain cultures, rebel
factions will display corpses

26:48.307 --> 26:49.475
as a show of power.

26:49.508 --> 26:54.380
U.S. serviceman would offer
the ultimate bragging right.

26:55.815 --> 26:59.185
Question is:
where did they move it to?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.353
Hey.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.322
Been looking for you.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.024
Oh, just had to get some air.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.793
Heard we got a
lead on the jacket.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.860
Barely.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.428
Len Bowers said he bought it

27:09.461 --> 27:11.397
from some rug importer
named Hameed.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.299
It's a start.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.869
It's a freakin' needle
in a haystack is what it is.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.371
You're doing your best, Chris.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.974
That's not good enough.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.676
I mean, Mr. Chase was right.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.112
We should have just
let this go.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.715
And where would
that leave his wife?

27:28.748 --> 27:31.450
Wouldn't you want your
family to keep searching?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.886
I'm not sure
what I'd want anymore.

27:39.726 --> 27:43.029
My older brother, Cade--

27:43.062 --> 27:45.431
I haven't seen him
in almost five years.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.266
Were you two close?

27:48.835 --> 27:50.202
Yeah, I worshipped him.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.138
He was that guy.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.907
All-state quarterback,
honor roll.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.909
One who got all the girls.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.213
Summer he turned 21,

28:01.247 --> 28:04.450
he was diagnosed with
bipolar disorder.

28:04.483 --> 28:08.454
He would stay up for a whole
week and then crash for days.

28:11.924 --> 28:15.694
And four years ago, he didn't
show up for the holidays.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.732
Few weeks went by.

28:19.766 --> 28:22.101
Then a month.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.103
We searched
everywhere for him.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.105
Shelters, hospitals.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.940
We set up a hot line.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.911
I mean, I'm a cop, Addie.
This is what I do.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.947
I find people.
I solve mysteries.

28:34.981 --> 28:38.450
And I haven't been able to do a
damn thing about my own brother.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.819
I'm sorry.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.994
Brody found a signed
shipping order from the docks.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.495
"Hameed Azizi."

28:49.528 --> 28:51.397
Go.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.084
Hameed Azizi?

29:12.118 --> 29:13.119
Yes?

29:13.152 --> 29:14.420
NCIS.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.523
Didn't even
have time to stretch.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.525
Why do they always run?

29:29.969 --> 29:32.138
This is where I tell you
to put your hands up!

29:32.171 --> 29:34.173
On your head.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.048
I thought you were tax people
coming about my import license.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.916
We'll worry about
your license later.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.853
Right now, we're here to talk
to you about this jacket.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.056
The one you
sold this guy.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.490
Where'd you get it?

29:51.523 --> 29:53.259
At the port.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.261
Here in New Orleans?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.463
In Karachi.

29:57.496 --> 30:01.100
I visit a few times a year
to get rugs to sell.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.003
There is a boy, Sami--
he helps me load cargo.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.938
He was wearing the coat.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.306
Why'd you want it?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.941
There's a market
for these things,

30:08.975 --> 30:10.509
and I'm a businessman.

30:10.542 --> 30:13.980
This boy, Sami--
where'd he get it?

30:14.013 --> 30:16.248
LASALLE:
Ghazni.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.518
It's a province about 100 klicks
south of Daykundi,

30:19.551 --> 30:21.453
which is where
the explosion occurred.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.956
Thanks. Navy LNO in Ghazni
located the boy.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.858
They're patching him through
right now.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.265
Agent Pride, Lieutenant
Commander Blake Conner.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.168
We located the child
wrangling odd jobs at the port.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.374
Hi, Sami.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.610
Wanted to ask you
a few questions.

30:46.078 --> 30:49.381
Sami...

30:49.415 --> 30:51.150
do you remember this jacket?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.421
Can you tell me
where you got it?

30:55.454 --> 30:59.125
In my village,
when I was working for Mujahed.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.993
Rebels?

31:03.562 --> 31:04.763
And they gave you the jacket?

31:07.233 --> 31:10.469
They paid me to bring rice and
water to the man in the hole.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.440
The one who was
fixing the cell phones.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.309
Taz.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.912
He's the one
who gave me the jacket.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.948
BRODY:
Taz?

31:21.981 --> 31:25.417
Zack Chase may still be alive.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.488
When was the last time
you saw the man in the hole?

31:29.521 --> 31:30.990
A month ago.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.026
What do you say, King?

31:35.661 --> 31:38.630
I say we're going
to Afghanistan.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.673
If Sami's intel
is good,

31:47.706 --> 31:50.376
we're gonna find
Petty Officer Chase

31:50.409 --> 31:52.178
in a bunker somewhere

31:52.211 --> 31:54.213
in the southeast quadrant
of that village.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.547
Go time.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.583
Let's move.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.966
You sure your husband
doesn't need something?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.968
Coffee, something to eat?

32:16.002 --> 32:18.070
No, he needs to be out there.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.739
Being occupied.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.075
His way of dealing.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.445
I remember when
we first got the call

32:26.478 --> 32:29.248
about Zack-- the explosion.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.283
I just...

32:31.317 --> 32:34.053
sat there on the couch and wept.

32:36.022 --> 32:39.758
Marsh--
he went out to the garage,

32:39.791 --> 32:42.028
pulled out his toolbox.

32:42.061 --> 32:45.164
Said he needed to replace
the washer in the faucet.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.735
Thing had been
dripping for months.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.171
We all have
our coping mechanisms.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.673
His is being practical.

32:54.706 --> 32:58.677
For me, practical gets
in the way of possible.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.074
*

33:55.801 --> 33:57.769
We're too late.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.805
He's gone.

34:15.354 --> 34:18.490
No sign of blood or a struggle.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.734
Cell phone bases.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.407
Sami was wrong.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.476
Zack wasn't fixing
cell phones.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.511
He was being forced
to make detonators.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.147
Insurgents have been
trying to get around

34:41.180 --> 34:44.183
our jamming devices for years.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.685
It's a perfect job
for a EOD tech.

34:46.718 --> 34:49.221
Yeah.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.689
Explains why
there was no chatter

34:50.722 --> 34:52.658
after Zack got captured.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.427
He was their secret weapon.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.703
King.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.575
He must have been
counting the days.

35:17.549 --> 35:21.353
If he was,
he's terrible at math.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.429
BRODY:
Two rows total 97.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.663
Should be triple that.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.699
Chase disappeared
almost nine months ago.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.434
Okay, wait a minute.

35:35.467 --> 35:39.405
If you add the two rows
separately, you get 31 and 66.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.707
Look at that gap.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.709
They're coordinates.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.513
Latitude is commonly
designated by the plus sign,

35:47.546 --> 35:49.181
so that's the top row.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.949
And longitude is usually
the minus sign,

35:50.982 --> 35:53.319
which means it's the bottom.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.496
31 latitude.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.499
66 longitude.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.669
Shu Buldak compound,
70 miles south of here.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.771
We got it. Lieutenant.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.473
Let's move.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.208
Mount up!

36:56.682 --> 36:58.684
(men shouting in native
language, gunfire continues)

37:12.698 --> 37:15.501
(man shouting in
native language)

37:22.908 --> 37:24.876
(continues shouting
in native language)

37:31.683 --> 37:32.884
Hey!

37:41.460 --> 37:42.861
Zack Chase?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.396
Yeah.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.764
Can you walk?
Yeah.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.873
They tried to get me
to build them a detonator.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.007
But I wouldn't do it.

37:56.041 --> 37:59.711
That's when they
talked about moving me.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.581
We'd swept
the munitions plant before.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.916
I knew the coordinates, so I
scratched them into the wall.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.488
Something inside me
just told me not to give up.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.725
Got your mom's outlook
on the world.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.864
Oh!
Mom!

38:18.897 --> 38:20.832
Oh! Zack.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.074
Special Agent Pride.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.848
I almost gave up
on getting him back.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.519
And you didn't.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.821
Thank you.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.859
Dad!

38:58.504 --> 39:00.506
LIZA:
Oh, my baby.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.846
Where you off to?

39:07.879 --> 39:09.948
To Jackson Square
for some caroling.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.583
What can I say?

39:11.617 --> 39:14.152
I'm a sucker for
"Little Drummer Boy."

39:14.185 --> 39:16.388
Nothing wrong with that.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.689
Either of you care to join me?

39:17.723 --> 39:20.125
PRIDE:
Well, jet lag's gonna

39:20.158 --> 39:22.861
ruin any chance of sleep, so...

39:22.894 --> 39:24.896
guess I'm in.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.865
Christopher?

39:26.898 --> 39:29.835
Oh, y'all go ahead.
Got a few things to finish up.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.603
Good night, Lasalle.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.405
Good night, Brody.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.040
I'll meet you there.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.408
All right.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.846
You okay?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.548
Yeah.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.083
You told me to go
learn things.

39:45.116 --> 39:48.587
I was looking
at it all wrong.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.691
He changed his last name--
Cade Lambert.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.626
It's our mother's maiden name.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.965
Looks like an opportunity.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.805
Let me know
if you need some help.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.039
Appreciate it, King.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.014
Merry Christmas.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.917
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.987
Merry Christmas, y'all.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.225
What are you
doing here, Watkins?

40:27.258 --> 40:30.729
Just checking
in on a friend.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.097
That's a lucky friend.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.999
Damn straight he is.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.803
Finding Zack,

40:37.836 --> 40:40.038
bringing him home
to his parents...

40:40.071 --> 40:41.907
It was a good day.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.108
Yeah.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.510
Couldn't have done it
without you.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.678
Was that a compliment?

40:46.712 --> 40:49.681
Could take it back.
Too late.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.552
So what do you say
we head up to Jackson Square

40:53.585 --> 40:55.186
and listen to the carols?

40:55.220 --> 40:58.590
You sure? 'Cause that might
ruin your Scrooge cred.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.827
Come on.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.562
Well, after, we could
catch a midnight showing

41:03.595 --> 41:05.063
of It's a Wonderful Life.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.565
Now, don't push your luck.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.066
All right, Lasalle.
