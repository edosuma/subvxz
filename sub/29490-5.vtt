04:02.503 --> 04:03.765
Brandon: Gotcha.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.857
Don't try anything.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.913
Man.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.525
The look on your face.

04:26.048 --> 04:29.660
Dude, seriously, I'm --
I'm just messin' with you.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.627
You're fast.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.890
Took me forever
to catch up.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.861
Over there.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.527
Eugene: Normally,
my chief concern

05:10.571 --> 05:12.094
would be the hidden beauty
of the grain,

05:12.137 --> 05:14.096
but with quantity
being of the essence,

05:14.139 --> 05:15.837
rift and quarter sawing
it'll be.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.360
Happy to recapitulate.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.537
Oh, no, no, just checking in.
Y'all good?

05:20.581 --> 05:22.844
Eugene's come up with
a zero-waste plan.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.803
Claims he can use every cubic
inch of the tree, even the bark.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.065
Seems as good a time
as any

05:27.109 --> 05:28.676
to master the Pueblo art
of basket weaving.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.942
Hey, uh,
before you head off,

05:33.985 --> 05:35.465
Earl and I
were talking.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.554
Instead of using the extra wood
for the addition,

05:37.598 --> 05:38.947
what if we made
some weapons?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.818
You know, big ones,
defensive,

05:40.862 --> 05:42.472
couple -- couple of catapults
for the north wall.Yeah.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.561
Yeah, no, look, I think
it's a good idea, honestly,

05:44.605 --> 05:45.780
just not right now,

05:45.823 --> 05:47.129
not with half the Kingdom
still in tents.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.218
Okay. I get it.

05:50.393 --> 05:54.136
So, the Whisperers smash
a giant hole in our wall...

05:54.179 --> 05:55.572
Yeah, well, we don't know
it was them for sure.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.182
...and now they're
throwin' walkers at us

05:57.226 --> 05:59.141
every couple hours,
and we're just gonna sit here,

05:59.184 --> 06:01.883
twiddlin' our damn thumbs?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.580
It happened again.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.843
Root cellar.
Middle of the night.

still in recovery

Nah.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.397
She's not here?

08:50.051 --> 08:51.748
She was
tracking something,

08:51.792 --> 08:53.663
said she'd meet us
back here.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.404
Should've been back
by now.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.813
Was that it?

09:12.856 --> 09:14.336
Did I get it?

09:14.379 --> 09:17.600
Nah. You woulda
totally whistled back, right?

09:17.644 --> 09:19.123
My dad, he used to tell me
how, like,

09:19.167 --> 09:20.342
you and the Saviors
would, like,

09:20.385 --> 09:22.997
whistle back and forth
like that before --

09:23.040 --> 09:27.218
You, uh -- you say you had
some granola or some shit?

09:28.742 --> 09:31.571
Sorry about the raisins
and the busted knife.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.964
Was kinda in a rush
when I packed it all.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.795
So, you're really
not gonna tell me

09:38.839 --> 09:41.102
how you got outta
that cell?

09:42.407 --> 09:45.585
Alright, well, at least tell me
what we're lookin' for.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.587
Someplace safe.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.633
I get it.
A new Sanctuary.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.114
Damn,
how badass was that place?

09:53.157 --> 09:55.812
And then Rick Grimes
comes along,

09:55.856 --> 09:59.773
talk about hypocrisy,
kills our parents,

09:59.816 --> 10:02.602
drags us to Alexandria,

10:02.645 --> 10:06.083
lectures us
about community.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.259
Eh. Can't argue that.
It ain't bullshit.

10:08.303 --> 10:11.611
Man, I heard you made him
cut his own kid's hand off,

10:11.654 --> 10:13.047
then you killed them.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.223
Carl Grimes --
I heard you shot him.

10:15.266 --> 10:19.096
I never did that.

10:19.140 --> 10:23.623
And I never did that
to Carl.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.235
Carl was...

10:30.238 --> 10:32.501
I would never kill a kid.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.986
Yeah, no, definitely.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.684
I'm with you, obviously.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.817
We're both Negan.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.834
Who would do this?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.531
The skin freaks.

11:02.574 --> 11:03.532
Damn.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.535
Should we cross?

11:06.578 --> 11:10.060
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend"?

11:10.104 --> 11:12.715
No.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.283
Thanks for your help.

11:59.327 --> 12:03.200
Sorry. I just needed a second
to wrap your gift.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.552
There's more.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.859
I swiped it all
from Alexandria.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.557
Was waiting for the right time
to surprise you.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.784
Took me forever
to find this.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.874
Found it in the back
of an old storage garage.

12:24.918 --> 12:28.182
My dad said
he never saw you without it.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.795
Listen, uh...

12:32.839 --> 12:35.537
why don't you just
put that in your backpack?

12:35.580 --> 12:38.018
I don't
wanna be recognized.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.150
You like it, though,
right?

12:42.196 --> 12:44.154
Does pig shit stink?

14:09.413 --> 14:11.241
I'm gonna say...

14:11.285 --> 14:13.330
she's a seven.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.508
What?

14:17.552 --> 14:19.032
Isn't this
the kind of stuff

14:19.075 --> 14:20.685
you and the Saviors
used to do to kill time?

14:20.729 --> 14:25.299
I can't say that I remember
rating walkers on hotness.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.257
Besides,
she's clearly a three.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.477
Spot's not half bad,
right?

14:29.520 --> 14:32.915
New Sanctuary.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.025
You gotta be kidding me.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.323
Damn!
Classic Negan.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.384
It's not your fault.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.571
Hey.

16:03.614 --> 16:06.530
Did I ever tell you about
my brother, Merle?

16:06.574 --> 16:09.359
Uh...

16:12.884 --> 16:14.147
Merle.

16:14.190 --> 16:19.021
Okay, this one time,
he takes me fishing.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.414
Right?

16:20.457 --> 16:24.244
Fishing, right,
on this big lake, right,

16:24.287 --> 16:26.550
which is, uh...

16:26.594 --> 16:28.770
private property...

16:28.813 --> 16:30.032
right?

16:30.076 --> 16:35.733
In this boat,
which is, uh, stolen.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.953
Stolen boat, right?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.347
And he's drinking,
right?

16:40.390 --> 16:43.002
So he's fishing,
he's drinking.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.786
He falls in the lake.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.744
Like, ka-pssh!

16:46.788 --> 16:48.137
Right?

16:48.181 --> 16:53.490
I have to take him,
uh, like this...

16:54.578 --> 16:56.667
...swim him
all the way back.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.670
I save his life,
right?

16:59.714 --> 17:01.890
You know
what he says to me?

17:03.631 --> 17:09.158
"Dummy,
go get the beer."

17:11.595 --> 17:14.598
Idiot, right?

17:14.642 --> 17:15.904
Yeah.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.997
It's gonna be alright.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.086
Come on.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.482
Good dog. Good dog.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.008
What?

18:08.522 --> 18:11.568
Alden: So, uh, the roofing
and the gutters should be fine,

18:11.612 --> 18:13.875
but the plumbing's
making me kinda nervous.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.747
I have to scavenge
for more copper.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.228
I should really
be out there with them.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.453
You know,
if I was lost in the woods,

18:26.496 --> 18:29.499
it's the three of them
I'd want to come looking for me.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.896
Somebody's gotta hang back,
deal with the plumbing.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.770
I'll -- I'll ask Oscar
about the copper.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.340
You really think
Kelly's okay?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.734
I hope so.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.692
What about us?

18:48.736 --> 18:51.521
That tree
didn't fall on its own.

18:51.565 --> 18:55.395
Wasn't leaning or dying.
The roots were healthy.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.180
If you don't think they're
coming back for worse, son,

18:58.224 --> 19:00.051
you're not thinking
at all.

19:01.966 --> 19:05.927
I haven't forgotten about them,
you know?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.537
Think about 'em
every day.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.191
Well, good.
Don't stop.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.591
We've had some thefts
lately.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.376
Took a quarter
of our medical supplies.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.034
Sorry. I --

19:26.077 --> 19:27.514
No, no. It's, uh --

19:27.557 --> 19:31.126
Henry forged it
during his apprenticeship.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.216
Found it
wrapped among his things.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.437
A gift intended for me
but never...

19:40.570 --> 19:41.919
You okay?

19:41.963 --> 19:43.530
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.621
Uh-huh.

19:47.664 --> 19:48.839
That doesn't sound good.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.625
It's nothing.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.583
Just the regular
slings and arrows.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.238
Uh-huh. Or smoke inhalation from
the fire might've triggered it.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.413
Let me just --

19:57.457 --> 19:58.980
I said I was fine.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.503
Okay.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.569
How long have you --

20:22.612 --> 20:24.788
A month.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.487
It's grown since then.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.404
Look.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.624
It could be a lot of things,
yeah? Infection.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.800
You know
you might've injured yourself.I know what it is.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.019
Listen, without tests,
you can't be sure.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.413
Siddiq,
I know what it is.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.819
Growing up,
my grandmother went through it,

20:55.863 --> 20:58.039
then my father.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.303
The pain, the coughing,
the swelling.

21:01.347 --> 21:04.828
I watched them fight it
and win.

21:04.872 --> 21:08.441
Did you know thyroid cancer
had a 98% survival rate?

21:08.484 --> 21:11.618
Different times.

21:11.661 --> 21:15.012
Times of sorcery
and witchcraft.

21:15.056 --> 21:18.842
Chemo,
iodine radiation therapy,

21:18.886 --> 21:21.932
thyroidectomies.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.325
Now?

21:25.893 --> 21:27.503
Now we both know
what it means.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.811
No,
you can manage it.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.726
Acupuncture,
uh, hypnosis.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.858
There's -- You --

21:37.121 --> 21:41.909
You know, I've been struggling
with my own condition...

21:43.302 --> 21:45.347
...ever since the barn.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.092
That's why
I had to leave Alexandria.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.573
I just --
I can't stand

21:53.616 --> 21:56.140
how everyone looks to me
for some kinda...

22:00.754 --> 22:03.670
So, you know,
maybe we can't get away from it.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.759
But we cantalk about it.

22:05.802 --> 22:08.849
I mean,
what are we here for

22:08.892 --> 22:10.720
if not for each other?

22:13.157 --> 22:15.072
Amelia:
It was just Milo and me.

22:15.116 --> 22:20.382
We'd been walking
for days, weeks,

22:20.426 --> 22:22.341
until the hissers
ran through our camp,

22:22.384 --> 22:23.951
scattered everyone
to the winds.

22:23.994 --> 22:29.826
After that, we went back
to what it was before,

22:29.870 --> 22:32.394
what it always is
in the end --

22:32.438 --> 22:34.918
Milo and me,

22:34.962 --> 22:39.096
moving from place to place,
surviving.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.185
I get it.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.926
I've been there.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.406
I better
stay on my feet.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.626
Milo,
you wanna come on a walk?

22:46.669 --> 22:47.844
Yeah.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.373
Be safe.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.252
So, what are you
thinkin'?

23:04.295 --> 23:07.037
We follow 'em,
see where they're hiding it?

23:08.778 --> 23:10.606
Hiding what?

23:10.650 --> 23:12.173
They've got a stash
somewhere,

23:12.216 --> 23:13.827
probably
full of weapons, too.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.962
It's a chick and a kid,
Brandon.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.964
People are a resource.

23:21.008 --> 23:23.489
Yeah. Not them.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.845
Alright, look.

23:33.586 --> 23:38.765
I appreciate everything
you've done since Alexandria,

23:38.808 --> 23:42.377
but it's only gonna get
more dangerous from here.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.988
I think it's best
I go on alone

23:45.032 --> 23:46.903
and you go home.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.517
Okay.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.697
It's just,
if I go back,

23:57.740 --> 24:01.004
everyone's gonna wanna know
where I've been.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.267
What am I
supposed to say?

24:03.311 --> 24:05.835
I've never been
a great liar.

24:15.062 --> 24:18.457
New plan, then.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.808
You go
wherever the hell you want.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.723
You go back
to Alexandria,

24:23.766 --> 24:28.858
you tell the whole world
exactly where I am.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.295
You see,
I don't give a shit.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.254
Just as long
as I don't have to see

24:33.297 --> 24:37.345
that pasty, creepy-ass face
of yours ever again.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.528
You're just like
all the others.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.057
Careful, now.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.059
Ears are the trickiest.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.694
You have something
for me?

25:23.434 --> 25:26.786
I've been damming up the creek,
like you wanted.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.789
I've just come back
for one more guardian.

25:29.832 --> 25:33.096
A guardian taken
is another lost.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.100
Alpha: Patience.

25:37.144 --> 25:40.800
Shifts in strategy
take time.

25:40.843 --> 25:46.501
The creek,
the water, the tree --

25:46.545 --> 25:48.416
it will crush them.

25:48.459 --> 25:51.985
Or we could release
an army of thousands.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.381
Alpha: Go ahead.

25:57.425 --> 26:00.123
Say your piece.

26:00.167 --> 26:04.127
Instead of
these little nicks,

26:04.171 --> 26:08.436
getting our guardians killed
at their walls,

26:08.479 --> 26:10.569
why don't we...

26:10.612 --> 26:14.747
cut the enemy down
all at once?

26:19.403 --> 26:21.144
Let us vote.

26:23.494 --> 26:24.757
Anyone agree?

26:37.900 --> 26:40.163
That's democracy
for you.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.041
The human body...

26:50.173 --> 26:52.175
...is fragile.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.829
All it takes
for it to collapse

26:53.873 --> 26:58.138
is a few  nicks
in the right spots.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.057
Just like the enemy.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.973
When their world collapses,
the smart ones will know

27:07.016 --> 27:09.192
where to come to stay safe.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.631
We'll be waiting.

27:31.214 --> 27:34.217
You said you wanted
another guardian.

27:40.441 --> 27:43.705
Negan: Oh, no!
We're gonna crash!

27:45.315 --> 27:47.056
Ah.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.449
Hey.

27:49.537 --> 27:52.148
Don't worry, kid.
I don't bite.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.281
Your mom,
she's inside, packin',

27:54.324 --> 27:56.849
so we got a little bit of time
to kill.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.198
Where'd Brandon go?

27:58.241 --> 28:01.854
Brandon -- he went looking
for supplies.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.334
You know what?

28:04.378 --> 28:06.293
I'm gonna be real
with you.

28:06.336 --> 28:09.078
Uh, I told Brandon
to get lost.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.298
You see, uh,
it turns out,

28:11.341 --> 28:14.344
not the best co-pilot,
if you catch my dri--

28:15.519 --> 28:17.130
You don't catch my drift
at all, do ya?

28:17.173 --> 28:19.306
You've never
been on a plane.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.875
Aw, man, it's alright.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.268
It's not your fault
that God turned this world

28:25.312 --> 28:27.488
into an asspit
before you were born.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.926
Alright.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.102
Picture this, alright?

28:33.146 --> 28:36.584
Sitting on a plane,
really nice, comfy seats,

28:36.627 --> 28:39.282
but it feels like you've been
sitting on the runway

28:39.326 --> 28:41.937
for Goddamn ever.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.462
Suddenly,
there's this kinda rumbling,

28:45.506 --> 28:48.509
a groan, alright?

28:48.552 --> 28:52.208
The plane finally starts
to creep along, right,

28:52.252 --> 28:54.776
and now we're moving
faster and faster.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.125
And you look out
that window,

28:56.169 --> 28:58.301
and everything's
turning into a blur.

28:58.345 --> 29:02.175
And then, "Whew."

29:02.218 --> 29:03.785
Wheels come up
off the ground.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.266
You are flying.

29:06.309 --> 29:09.617
It is like voodoo magic,
man, alright?

29:09.660 --> 29:11.924
Up and up and up,
higher and higher,

29:11.967 --> 29:14.143
until it feels like
you are floating

29:14.187 --> 29:16.232
on top
of the frickin' world.

29:16.276 --> 29:19.583
And you're looking out
that little window,
and you can see houses.

29:19.627 --> 29:24.023
They look like little toy houses
and little toy cars.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.154
Oh.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.200
But the food?

29:27.243 --> 29:28.941
Unh-unh. No way.

29:28.984 --> 29:32.161
They served us something.
They called it beef stroganoff.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.207
Let me tell you something.
It looked like baby shit.

29:34.250 --> 29:38.080
And my Lucille
she wouldn't even touch it.

29:42.215 --> 29:46.001
Ah, kid, there is so much
you're gonna miss

29:46.045 --> 29:49.178
growing up
in this...screwed-up world.

29:49.222 --> 29:52.616
You know, driving
your first set of wheels,

29:52.660 --> 29:54.618
video games,

29:54.662 --> 29:56.098
nut-tapping.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.842
What, you've never heard
of nut-tapping?

30:00.886 --> 30:04.541
Seriously? With big ol'
sausage fingers like those?

30:06.195 --> 30:08.981
Alright, man, the whole point
of nut-tapping --

30:09.024 --> 30:11.070
catching the other guy
off guard, right,

30:11.113 --> 30:12.288
embarrassing him,

30:12.332 --> 30:14.813
getting even for him
calling your mom a slut

30:14.856 --> 30:16.031
or whatever.

30:17.293 --> 30:20.557
Wanna keep your wrist loose,
like this.

30:20.601 --> 30:23.560
Lean in all casual like.

30:23.604 --> 30:25.258
And then -- thwack!

30:25.301 --> 30:28.174
Snap your fingers
right on his nuts.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.871
Now, you gotta remember,
you go low.

30:29.915 --> 30:33.092
You go too high,
you get nothing but dick.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.137
Alright, let's see
what you got.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.574
You're a natural.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.360
See, if nut-tapping
were a sport,

30:40.403 --> 30:42.188
you wouldn't
have to 'roid up,

30:42.231 --> 30:44.233
and you would still be
in the hall of fame.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.109
Ahh.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.807
Alright, kid, dinner.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.896
Not gonna happen
without fire.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.464
Fire's not gonna happen
without wood.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.640
Tell me something.
You get all packed up?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.468
Yeah.

31:04.123 --> 31:08.736
Hey, you know,
I know that moving sucks.

31:08.779 --> 31:12.261
You know, it's like
I was telling your mom, though,

31:12.305 --> 31:14.829
I know a place that I'm pretty
sure they're gonna take you in.

31:14.873 --> 31:20.400
It's got really high walls,
farmland,

31:20.443 --> 31:23.229
even has a mansion
sitting in the middle of it.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.361
You just can't tell 'em
who brought ya, alright?

31:25.405 --> 31:28.103
But I will get you
as close as I can.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.758
One condition, though.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.021
Keep those meaty fingers
holstered up

31:33.065 --> 31:34.631
when my nuts are around.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.111
Okay.

31:36.155 --> 31:38.157
Deal?
Yeah.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.462
My man.

32:12.452 --> 32:13.932
I anoint you Gamma.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.813
Oh!

32:27.815 --> 32:29.773
Shit. Shit!

32:35.344 --> 32:36.345
It's okay.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.784
That's for you.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.048
I had it in my bag.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.442
Take it.

32:46.486 --> 32:47.530
It's okay.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.622
My name is Aaron.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.624
What --

32:54.668 --> 32:57.453
That's right. You guys
don't do names anymore.

32:58.846 --> 33:01.457
But you're from somewhere,
right?

33:01.501 --> 33:03.329
I'm from Vermont.
Where --

33:07.463 --> 33:09.378
You're welcome!

33:24.828 --> 33:25.786
Hey.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.182
Hey.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.255
We've gotta get her
back to Hilltop.

34:00.299 --> 34:03.302
Nah, I think we gotta
find somewhere closer.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.530
Tell them what?

34:21.711 --> 34:23.844
Did you know about this?

34:34.942 --> 34:37.249
Hey.
What's she saying?

34:37.292 --> 34:39.642
I said
I don't trust you.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.646
What's your problem?

34:43.690 --> 34:44.647
Huh?

34:44.691 --> 34:46.649
Hilltop takes you in.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.216
They got sick children
and mouths to feed,

34:48.260 --> 34:49.913
and you steal from 'em?

34:49.957 --> 34:52.699
All you're good for
is talking shit.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.302
That's it, right?

35:32.695 --> 35:34.262
You almost had me.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.003
Back on the bus,
when you kicked me out.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.573
Then I remembered,
"This is Negan.

35:40.616 --> 35:44.620
He's always messing with people,
keeping 'em in line."

35:44.664 --> 35:48.189
So I realized
there's a test.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.714
"It's gonna get a lot more
dangerous from here on out."

35:51.758 --> 35:53.542
That's what you said
to me.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.196
You wanted to make sure
that I had the balls

35:55.240 --> 35:57.503
to do what had to be done.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.419
What do you think?

36:04.640 --> 36:05.598
I passed, right?

36:05.641 --> 36:06.947
I am Neg--

37:30.291 --> 37:32.119
Dante: I had to pop
a couple blisters.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.426
Bill's still freaking out
about that rash.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.255
What else?

37:37.298 --> 37:39.387
I mean, the universe
is basically on pause

37:39.431 --> 37:40.736
till God gets back.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.002
I'm assuming
your mic's out,

37:46.046 --> 37:48.266
or else I'd hear you
laughing your balls off.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.877
Nope, still here.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.010
How's Rosita?

37:55.447 --> 37:57.753
She, uh, didn't want me
to tell you,

37:57.797 --> 37:59.407
but she caught
a little bug.

37:59.451 --> 38:02.105
She okay? Gabe back?

38:02.149 --> 38:04.282
Not yet.
But she'll be fine.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.114
I'll leave for home
tonight.

38:11.158 --> 38:12.899
You sure?

38:12.942 --> 38:14.901
Yeah, I'm sure.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.816
One other thing.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.948
Is Carol around?

38:18.992 --> 38:21.560
She's just outside.
Let me grab her.

38:42.755 --> 38:46.106
Hey, Carol.
Siddiq's on the radio for ya.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.919
You know,
it's scary to think, but...

39:16.963 --> 39:21.097
Kelly probably
wouldn't have made it

39:21.141 --> 39:23.796
if you guys hadn't have
found that stash.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.976
Sounds like it was
pretty far off the main road.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.934
Magna: Just say it.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.762
You think I stole everything
and hid it out there.

39:33.806 --> 39:36.548
Yeah, well, it wouldn't have
been the first time.

39:36.591 --> 39:39.812
Then...
it would've been smart.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.814
Yeah, or it would've been
a mis--

39:41.857 --> 39:44.382
Selfish, stupid.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.427
I was gonna say
a mistake.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.648
No, but you were
thinking it.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.954
For 13 years,
that's how you've looked at me.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.434
That is not true.

39:53.478 --> 39:56.611
Since the day
you showed up

39:56.655 --> 40:00.876
in your -- your fancy suit,
with all your fancy --

40:00.920 --> 40:02.835
Do you really wanna know
what I thought that day?

40:02.878 --> 40:05.968
I thought, "Here is a person,
an innocent person

40:06.012 --> 40:09.363
who's been locked up for a crime
they didn't commit,

40:09.407 --> 40:11.191
someone who's never
trusted anybody

40:11.234 --> 40:13.541
because no one's
ever trusted her,

40:13.585 --> 40:14.934
someone who's good.

40:14.977 --> 40:17.545
And, yeah, mad.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.939
Mad at everyone.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.245
Mad at the world
for being so messed up."

40:22.289 --> 40:25.814
My cousin,
she was a little girl,

40:25.858 --> 40:28.948
and he gets to go on
living his life?

40:30.079 --> 40:31.080
No way.

40:33.909 --> 40:36.825
But nobody came for him.

40:39.132 --> 40:42.091
So Icame for him.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.881
And there it is.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.884
Now that
we've bothkilled --

40:51.927 --> 40:55.017
how many people
have we killed, Miko?

40:55.061 --> 40:58.499
And still,
that look right there.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.981
I think you should find
another place to sleep.

41:20.042 --> 41:23.916
The...man with the metal arm
gave it to me.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.091
I don't know what that --

41:27.572 --> 41:29.008
Sit.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.957
We've all had to wear
different masks

42:05.000 --> 42:06.567
at different times.

42:08.351 --> 42:11.964
Call it
a kinda sacrifice.

42:13.356 --> 42:14.706
Like your sister.

42:18.971 --> 42:23.323
Your sacrifice was...
much greater.

42:24.716 --> 42:28.154
The man
with the metal arm...

42:28.197 --> 42:30.417
could prove useful.

42:33.463 --> 42:36.684
You might just
have to wear a newmask.

42:57.052 --> 42:59.402
Uh, yeah.

42:59.446 --> 43:02.580
Uh, Siddiq
has to go back.

43:04.407 --> 43:06.192
Is, um...

43:06.235 --> 43:07.976
Kelly okay?

43:08.890 --> 43:09.978
Mm.

43:21.294 --> 43:22.991
No, no, no.

43:23.035 --> 43:24.819
I get it. Um...

43:26.995 --> 43:28.997
Family.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.129
Right?

43:35.047 --> 43:37.179
Alright.

44:11.736 --> 44:14.869
Negan: Oh, you sorry,
rotten sacks of shit.

44:14.913 --> 44:18.699
What's a fella gotta do
to get eaten around here?

44:18.743 --> 44:21.049
What's the matter? Huh?

44:21.093 --> 44:24.400
Y'all scared
of the Big Bad Wolf?

44:27.577 --> 44:31.103
Little pig, little pig!

44:34.280 --> 44:35.281
Uh-oh.

44:35.324 --> 44:36.674
Let me in.

44:36.717 --> 44:38.893
And there you are!

44:40.678 --> 44:44.638
Oh, I am gonna huff.

44:48.337 --> 44:50.339
I am gonna puff.

44:55.083 --> 44:57.085
I am gonna blow...

45:00.349 --> 45:02.308
...your...

45:04.179 --> 45:05.746
...house...

45:08.140 --> 45:09.097
Ahh.

45:09.141 --> 45:11.099
...all the way in.

45:25.810 --> 45:28.377
Alright, you big-ass freak.

45:28.421 --> 45:30.162
Let's do this.
