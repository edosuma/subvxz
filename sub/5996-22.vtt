WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.605
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 So, here we are. After the
 mother of all love triangles,

00:04.638 --> 00:08.342
Jane finally chose Michael. And
 the wedding was supposed to be

00:08.376 --> 00:10.644
in the Villanueva house,
 only it flooded.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.246
So Rogelio rebuilt the house

00:12.280 --> 00:14.815
on the soundstage
 of his telenovela.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.251
Sweet, right?
 Not as sweet:

00:17.285 --> 00:19.753
Xiomara slept with
 Rogelio's nemesis, Esteban.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.223
Look, I-I made a huge mistake.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.359
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And poor
 Rafael. You see, he lost Jane.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.229
Oh, and his mom
 turned out to be a crime lord.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.431
And his stepmother Rose
 is one too.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.501
Or, she was. Yup.
 That's Raf's sister Luisa.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.837
And, well, Rose
 was the love of her life.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.240
Until she met
 Michael's partner Susanna.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.109
You need to go back to rehab.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.712
So that when you're out
I can take you out.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.647
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of complicated
 love lives,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.582
Rafael's other
 baby mama, Petra,

00:48.616 --> 00:50.284
still has feelings for him.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.585
And her long-lost twin Anezka

00:51.619 --> 00:53.154
was encouraging her.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.523
I think he is starting
to love you again.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.459
Oh, and Anezka is also
 epileptic. And honestly,

00:58.492 --> 01:00.294
there are a million
 other things happening.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.562
But we have a wedding
 to get to already,

01:01.595 --> 01:03.864
so let's go!

01:03.897 --> 01:07.435
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
 was a young girl

01:07.468 --> 01:10.638
there was one story
 she loved to be told

01:10.671 --> 01:13.341
over and over again.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.675
Go on.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.590
JANE: The same veil

01:29.623 --> 01:30.858
that your mother wore?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.200
Your shoe!

01:39.233 --> 01:40.768
(crack)
(people gasp)

01:40.801 --> 01:42.870
(indistinct chatter)

02:00.254 --> 02:01.755
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 To young Jane,

02:01.789 --> 02:04.792
it was the greatest
 love story ever told.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.402
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that day...

02:16.937 --> 02:18.739
...is tomorrow!

02:18.772 --> 02:21.342
We... we should stop.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.611
(sighs heavily)

02:26.380 --> 02:28.349
One more day.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.219
Just one more day.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.788
35 hours, 17 minutes,
but who's counting?

02:36.557 --> 02:37.891
Seriously. I can't wait...

02:37.925 --> 02:39.627
For all the sex?
Yeah, I get that.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.262
...to marry you.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.830
(sighing): Oh.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.709
(wedding bells ringing)

02:58.546 --> 03:00.248
(sighs)
Do we really
have to go out there?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.415
One more day.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.784
Just one more day.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.654
Yes, Charo, playing when
Mateo comes down the aisle.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.821
I have to go.
Florist on line two.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.957
Jane, Michael, I have

03:09.990 --> 03:12.426
a hundred things
to run by you! No!

03:12.460 --> 03:13.961
I can't be at
the church early.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.529
Everyone knows
that it's customary

03:15.563 --> 03:17.398
for the father of the
bride to drive the bride

03:17.431 --> 03:18.799
to the ceremony.
Hello, are you awake?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.268
Hello? Wake up! Hello?!
Dad, stop, stop.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.369
You can't talk like that
to the florist!

03:21.402 --> 03:22.536
Oh, it's fine.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.571
She and I, we like to banter

03:23.604 --> 03:24.638
a little. Anyway,

03:24.672 --> 03:25.773
you're just in time

03:25.806 --> 03:27.941
for Mateo's practice session.

03:27.975 --> 03:31.679
Because, after all, we cannot
have a ring bearer cry

03:31.712 --> 03:34.248
in the middle of the ceremony.
Mateo will be fine.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.984
And you need to take
a few deep breaths, okay?

03:37.017 --> 03:39.353
I'm sorry.
I'm just so happy

03:39.387 --> 03:41.389
that the wedding
is finally here.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.893
Go for Rogelio.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.297
I really, really can't wait
for our honeymoon.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.964
Oh, my God.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.366
What?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.001
I forgot to change
the reservation

03:54.034 --> 03:55.669
after the wedding moved up.
What?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.605
I reminded you.
I meant to,

03:57.638 --> 03:59.740
but it's just been a crazy week,
starting the job again.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.809
Yeah, I get that. Of course,
it's been a really crazy week

04:01.842 --> 04:03.677
for me too, trying to change
my thesis. And I still

04:03.711 --> 04:05.313
was able to call
everyone personally

04:05.346 --> 04:07.315
and explain to them why
we moved the wedding,

04:07.348 --> 04:09.317
and I rebooked people's hotels,
and I cancelled

04:09.350 --> 04:11.652
the rehearsal dinner.
I know, and I'm gonna fix this.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.387
We're gonna have somewhere
to stay on our wedding night

04:13.421 --> 04:14.588
that is not here,
with my family,

04:14.622 --> 04:15.789
at Rafael's hotel?

04:15.823 --> 04:18.526
Yes. Absolutely.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.593
Great.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.728
RAFAEL:
 Sounds great.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.332
Okay, I'll see you soon.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.366
Your sister?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.935
You had your Luisa voice.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.337
Yeah.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.004
She is on her way.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.574
Hopefully in good shape,
'cause I could really use

04:33.607 --> 04:35.976
a break from family
drama right now.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.547
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes. You'll recall
 Rafael's family drama

04:39.580 --> 04:42.616
had recently taken a turn
 for the bonkers,

04:42.650 --> 04:44.485
even by Solano
 family standards.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.420
How do you feel?
Well, I'm glad

04:46.454 --> 04:48.021
my mother's in jail.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.824
Now I just want them
to find my brother.
Yeah.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.627
But I asked how do you feel?

04:53.661 --> 04:57.030
Not great.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.600
It's all a little much
sometimes, you know?

05:04.071 --> 05:05.539
It's Jane.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.040
I'm sorry, I got to go,

05:07.074 --> 05:09.076
it's urgent.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.912
Are you okay,
is everything okay?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.647
Yes, yes, you just
have to see this!

05:13.681 --> 05:15.048
Raf's here, Mom put him down.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.985
Okay, are you watching,
are you ready?

05:18.018 --> 05:20.821
Yes. For what?
Mateo,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.657
come here.
Show Daddy.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.394
Come here.
RAFAEL: Oh, my God,
he's walking! He's...

05:26.427 --> 05:28.396
Can you believe it?
No, I can't bel...

05:28.429 --> 05:29.797
This is amazing!
I know, I know. He just...

05:29.830 --> 05:31.432
He was pushing the wagon,
and then he let go.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.800
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Behold,

05:32.833 --> 05:34.134
the most amazing and
 coordinated boy

05:34.167 --> 05:35.836
in human history.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.339
And just in time to
walk down the aisle.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.944
(sighs) Okay, I got to run.
I just wanted you to see that.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.947
No, no, thank you for texting.
Where are you going, by the way?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.882
To meet with my advisor.
I'm trying to change my thesis.

05:48.916 --> 05:49.983
The one you were trying
to get approved forever?

05:50.017 --> 05:52.119
Yeah. I-I just realized
that my heart is not in it.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.855
But, you know, it may be
too late to make a change.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.391
Unless somebody else
tells me that they loved me.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.661
Wait, what?
I said unless
my professor okays it.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.895
Okay.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.163
Bye, Mr. Sweetface.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.566
My little walker.

06:05.599 --> 06:09.002
Oh, the places you'll go.
(giggling)

06:09.036 --> 06:11.405
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of big milestones.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.407
Congratulations.
Glad you're back on the force.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.175
Thank you, sir. Oh, hey,

06:15.208 --> 06:16.844
did you ever find out
who leaked the details

06:16.877 --> 06:18.746
about the Sin Rostro
investigation to the press?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.615
We're working on that.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.685
Now go.
Enjoy your wedding.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.490
It's got to be him.
He's the only one

06:29.523 --> 06:31.158
who had access to
all the information.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.393
(horn honking)

06:41.835 --> 06:43.003
So you... you're still together?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.171
I know, it's weird.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.739
Actually, I was wondering

06:45.773 --> 06:47.608
if she could be my plus one
to your wedding.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.909
Oh. I mean... Uh...
Forget it.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.143
It's weird.
Uh, well, let me just...

06:50.177 --> 06:51.545
I'll ask Jane.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.913
'Cause, you know, Luisa...

06:52.946 --> 06:55.483
accidentally inseminated
her and all.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.518
Yeah. Of course. I get it.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.220
That's what Jane
just said.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.123
Be quiet! Oh, no, not you. Her.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.126
Okay, no more excuses.
We are less than 24 hours

07:06.159 --> 07:09.162
till go time. (gasps)

07:09.196 --> 07:11.499
Okay, well, tell Bruno Mars
if he doesn't confirm,

07:11.532 --> 07:13.467
I'm cutting him
from the wedding lineup.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.736
Yes, I know he played
the "Super Bowl".

07:15.769 --> 07:18.506
Tell him this is the Super Bowl
of weddings.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.741
Hey, did you ever get
a firm answer from Dina?
Oh, she can't

07:20.774 --> 07:23.176
make it, she needs to get all
her work done before the strike.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.878
Okay. Well, you know,
if that changes,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.747
just let me know
and we'll squeeze her in.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.649
Don't you give me attitude!

07:28.682 --> 07:31.084
What?
Not you. Her.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.760
Relax, relax.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.595
Yeah, no, no, not you.
You don't relax,

07:41.629 --> 07:43.063
you do the opposite of relaxing.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.098
(doorbell rings)

07:51.939 --> 07:54.642
Yeah, well,
Rise above and all that.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.076
Xiomara Villanueva?

07:59.212 --> 08:00.648
This is from...

08:00.681 --> 08:02.049
I can see who it's from!

08:02.082 --> 08:04.918
Xiomara?

08:08.822 --> 08:09.957
Nothing.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.794
Okay. I-I might have...

08:13.827 --> 08:15.128
spent the night with Esteban.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.797
It was a mistake

08:16.830 --> 08:18.298
and I told him to back off,
but he won't.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.299
Xiomara!

08:19.332 --> 08:20.300
Look--

08:20.333 --> 08:22.035
No one can know

08:22.069 --> 08:24.037
about this. Especially...
(phone rings)

08:24.071 --> 08:26.073
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, I was gonna say Rogelio.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.075
But yeah,
 Jane would be pissed too.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.610
Hi, hon.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.811
How was the meeting?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.645
Oh, not great. Donaldson says

08:32.679 --> 08:34.280
I can't change my thesis without
submitting something else.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.683
And I don't know
what I do want to write about.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.085
Maybe it's for the best?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.888
So you can focus
on the wedding?
Yeah, maybe.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.823
Anyway, don't forget to
bring my shoes to the rehearsal.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.792
And don't be late.
I won't. And we won't be late,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.894
don't worry.
Sorry.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.329
It's just... this is
the important part, you know?

08:49.362 --> 08:52.099
Like, the actual sacrament
of marriage.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.001
And I just really
want it to go well.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.037
It will, don't worry.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.807
(exhales)
Okay. Bye.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.942
(gasps)

09:01.975 --> 09:04.678
Why do you have

09:04.712 --> 09:06.179
a sex basket

09:06.213 --> 09:08.816
from my mortal enemy?

09:08.849 --> 09:11.852
(scoffs)
That's not a sex basket.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.856
I know a sex basket

09:15.889 --> 09:17.090
when I see one.
It was just once.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.693
It meant nothing.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.929
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here, now.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.864
Sorry again, they should be here
any minute. (chuckles)

09:23.897 --> 09:25.733
As long as this
doesn't happen tomorrow.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.868
Since we accommodated your
last-minute schedule change,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.670
we have a very limited window.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.239
Oh, I-I know, absolutely.
And you know what they say--

09:32.272 --> 09:34.007
bad rehearsal, great wedding.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.614
Some good news,
at least.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.816
The Biltmore had
a last-minute cancellation.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.084
Guess who scored the
presidential suite?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.953
Whoa.
Yeah.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.154
Wait, how much did that cost?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.255
Like 1,700 bucks.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.090
What?
Yeah.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.893
That is, like, half of our
budget for our honeymoon.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.029
Why didn't you consult with me?
Consult you?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.265
We're getting married.
So, what, I got to consult you
every time

09:58.298 --> 10:00.300
I want to spend money now?
That much, yes.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.269
Hi there, hi.
Sorry we're late.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.837
Good, we can start, let's start.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.239
Sounds good.
Uh, first, hi, everyone.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.975
You told me to fix this.
I'm sorry I didn't ask you

10:08.008 --> 10:09.977
exactly how to fix it.
Don't be sarcastic.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.246
First, welcome, everyone,
to this joyous occasion.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.715
Let's-let's get everyone
lined up.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
Jane, who's walking you
down the aisle?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.284
Oh, my-my parents
and my grandma.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.721
Okay.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.756
Okay, let's go.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.993
(exclaims softly)
Oh...

10:26.026 --> 10:29.863
Oops-- looks like we might need
to narrow down to two.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.999
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Good luck.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.401
I agree. Xiomara, you
should move to the rear.
Excuse me?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.069
It's only right.
Oh, don't you start.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.939
Me start, me start?
Guys, what's going on?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.041
I'm not the one who
slept with the devil!

10:41.074 --> 10:43.076
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And friends, that's when Jane's

10:43.110 --> 10:45.312
newly-mobile son took off.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.014
Oh, no, Mateo!

10:47.047 --> 10:49.817
Mateo, no! Oh, oh! (shrieks)

10:49.850 --> 10:51.819
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 On the bright side,

10:51.852 --> 10:54.822
if bad rehearsals
 really do make good weddings,

10:54.855 --> 10:57.858
this is going to be
 the best wedding ever.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.265
We are so sorry, Father.
We've just been

11:05.298 --> 11:06.834
under so much pressure.
I'm fine.

11:06.867 --> 11:11.238
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.340
I'm sorry, Jane.
I shouldn't have said anything.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
So, so sorry.
I was so mad.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.377
(Xiomara sighs)
ROGELIO:
Why are you moving

11:17.410 --> 11:18.611
your-your head
like this? What?
What?

11:18.645 --> 11:20.380
'Cause you two are not fighting
the night before my wedding.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.950
After my wedding,
you two can kill each other,

11:22.983 --> 11:25.753
but before my wedding,
everyone gets along.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.287
Got it?

11:32.860 --> 11:35.395
(sighs heavily)

11:37.130 --> 11:39.833
Oh. I'm so sorry.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.401
No, I should have consulted you.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.971
I... I just got defensive
'cause I ruined our honeymoon.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.873
Oh.
I'll cancel the fancy hotel.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.507
No. No.
It's happening.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.142
(Mateo crying)
Ah.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.113
It feels weird, leaving...

11:53.146 --> 11:56.917
It's fine. I'll see you
tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.419
And then, every day
for the rest of our lives.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.957
I love you.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.793
I love you, too.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.799
PETRA: Rafael just runs to her.
 I mean,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.767
when will it end?
Tomorrow.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.303
The sun always coming
out tomorrow.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.406
When he sees Jane being married,
which is why you must be there.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.875
I already don't even know if
I should go at this point.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.143
No, you must.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hmm.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.245
Why is it so important to her?

12:25.278 --> 12:28.081
For future relationship
with Jane.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.917
And because

12:29.950 --> 12:33.186
when-when Rafael sees her
marrying someone else,

12:33.220 --> 12:35.488
he will need comfort...
from you.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.457
No. No, I told him

12:37.490 --> 12:39.993
I don't want him if he's in love
with someone else.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.461
And I meant it.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.898
I mean it, Raf.
I am committed to my sobriety.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.366
And to earning
your trust back.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.503
And this thing
with Susanna-- is it serious?

12:50.537 --> 12:52.305
Yes. (laughs)

12:52.339 --> 12:55.575
But it's different than
any relationship I've had.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.245
We haven't even had sex,
just light hand play,

12:58.278 --> 13:01.048
because she wants to get
to know each other first.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.349
So how are you?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.051
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Where to begin?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.019
Still love Jane.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.021
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Direct, to the point.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.057
She's the love of my life.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.193
And yes, I know,
she's getting married.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.062
I don't know.
Maybe if I tell her.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.429
If there's even
the slightest chance

13:16.463 --> 13:18.565
she won't walk down the aisle,
then I have to.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.300
I mean, right?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And friends, knowing Luisa

13:22.069 --> 13:24.371
as he did, he fully
 expected her to say...

13:24.404 --> 13:26.606
Don't do it.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Not that.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.909
Trust me, I get it.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.079
I thought I would never love
again the way that I loved Rose.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.917
But, then I met
Susanna, and now...

13:36.950 --> 13:39.319
I'm starting to feel
the same exact way.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.954
And you will, too.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.223
Just let Jane go.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.458
Hun, let it go.
So you fought.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.227
It's not that.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.596
There's just so much we haven't
talked about. Basic stuff.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.498
Marriage stuff.
Tomorrow's just the wedding.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.066
And the rehearsal
was a disaster.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.134
What if tomorrow's awful?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.538
What?

14:04.144 --> 14:06.313
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 The man she lost
 her virginity to.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.586
But it was perfect.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.422
The shoes, the veil...

14:29.169 --> 14:31.204
(audience gasping, murmuring)

14:47.320 --> 14:49.889
So, the veil
I'm wearing tomorrow...?

14:52.993 --> 14:55.295
(gasps)

14:55.328 --> 14:58.531
(laughter)

15:01.301 --> 15:02.702
(phone chimes)

15:02.735 --> 15:04.637
Oh, man.
Oh!

15:04.671 --> 15:06.573
(sighs)

15:06.606 --> 15:08.541
It's Michael.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.623
(sighs)

15:43.710 --> 15:45.212
JANE:
Three times a week?

15:45.245 --> 15:46.613
At Abuela's?
That's-that's a lot.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.481
But how about two dinners
a week?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.416
Minimum.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.717
36 hours is my maximum

15:50.750 --> 15:52.352
for dirty dishes to stay.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.453
Done.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.755
And now for item 23.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.490
I know it's a big one.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.758
(sighs)

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
When do we want
to have another kid?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.363
(magical tinkling)

16:03.396 --> 16:06.466
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw, look, they're having
 all the feels.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.540
(magical tinkling)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 All three of them.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.581
(sighs)

16:26.286 --> 16:30.390
Abuela.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.113
(Jane gasps)

16:53.146 --> 16:55.148
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And dear viewer,
 that's when it hit her!

16:55.182 --> 16:56.616
I know
what my new thesis should be.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.419
It's a love story loosely based
on my grandparents.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.554
It'll start in Venezuela
and explore class differences,

17:01.588 --> 17:03.623
religion, sexual stigma,
their journey to America.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.492
Jane...
I can even make it
bilingual even.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.826
Jane, it sounds wonderful,
but...

17:06.858 --> 17:08.161
Don't tell me it's too late.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.496
The committee
is meeting right now.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.797
There's no time
to write a new proposal.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.266
Please. I can't
spend an entire year

17:13.300 --> 17:15.167
working on something
I'm not passionate about.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.305
You know what?
Just come in now.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.807
Pitch the idea in person.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.510
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Remember, Jane,
 she hates the marriage plot.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.779
I have... a... thing.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.681
Well, you're just gonna
have to decide

17:28.715 --> 17:31.518
if your thing is more important
than your thesis.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.087
(sighs)
JANE:
 And it's on the way.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.389
And I will make it to
our wedding with time to spare,

17:36.423 --> 17:38.558
but I will not go
if you are not okay with it.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.093
MICHAEL:
You're on your way, aren't you?

17:40.127 --> 17:42.529
I am, yes,
but I am ready and willing

17:42.562 --> 17:44.597
to go back upstairs
if you say no.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.100
Go! But don't be late.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.136
I won't. I won't. I love you.
(elevator bell dings)

17:50.437 --> 17:52.739
Give me!
Okay.
Go!

17:52.772 --> 17:54.741
JANE:
Hey.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.843
Sorry. I got here
as fast as I could.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.411
That's a lot of makeup.

17:58.445 --> 18:02.649
Yes. I know. Should we go in?

18:02.682 --> 18:05.218
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, man, I hope it goes well.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.220
JANE:
 It went great, Ma!

18:07.254 --> 18:08.621
The committee said yes
right away.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.191
I'm so excited.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.659
Ugh! What am I doing wrong?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.195
These buttons aren't closing.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.663
I don't know. I can't see.
Turn around.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.198
Oh, it's crooked.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.499
This one?
Nope.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.867
Here?
No, no, no.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.202
That's not it. More to the left.
Hey...

18:22.235 --> 18:23.403
Then this one?
No. More, more.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.637
No, don't just keep
saying "more," Ma.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.639
Th-That one!
I can't reach that one!

18:26.673 --> 18:29.876
It's right... It...

18:29.909 --> 18:32.379
I told you I had a thing.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.913
Call you back, Ma.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.648
Why am I not surprised?

18:35.682 --> 18:38.385
Look, I don't want to be late.
Can you help me?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.920
Yeah.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.656
Oh, good.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.159
These are...
these are tiny.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.660
I know. (laughs)

18:47.694 --> 18:50.263
I feel like I'm locking you into
the patriarchy as I do this.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.166
Well, I appreciate
you doing it anyway.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.534
Okay.
Ah!

18:54.567 --> 18:57.237
Good. Go. And, hey,

18:57.270 --> 18:59.272
congratulations.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.942
On your new thesis
being approved.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.545
Thanks.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.182
(panting)

19:09.216 --> 19:12.219
We're on our way, Michael,
eight minutes away.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.187
I love you, too.
How did it go?

19:14.221 --> 19:16.189
Success! They loved it.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.825
Ooh! Ooh!

19:18.858 --> 19:21.294
(panting)
Oh!

19:21.328 --> 19:22.829
Okay.
Why is it
so cold in here?

19:22.862 --> 19:24.831
I left the car running
with the air conditioner on

19:24.864 --> 19:26.466
so your makeup wouldn't
run from the heat.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.236
Oh, thanks, Dad.
(engine revving)

19:29.269 --> 19:30.937
Dad?
It won't go!

19:30.970 --> 19:32.772
(hissing)
Aah! Turn it off!
It's smoking!

19:32.805 --> 19:34.674
(yells)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Turns out it's not such

19:34.707 --> 19:36.776
a good idea to keep a
 60-year-old Rolls Royce running

19:36.809 --> 19:38.478
with the AC on for a half hour.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.580
Uber. I'll call an Uber.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.350
38 minutes away?
Oh, my God!

19:43.383 --> 19:46.986
Uh, okay, Dad,
do not panic. Uh...

19:47.019 --> 19:49.389
The bus. Run. Dad.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.795
Run!
(shrieks)

19:55.828 --> 19:57.697
Aah. Oh. No, no, no.
ROGELIO:
No!

19:57.730 --> 19:59.666
Wait, wait, wait. Oh.
ROGELIO:
Stop the bus!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.368
Okay. Oh.
Okay.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.835
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Whew! They made it!

20:02.869 --> 20:04.504
Thank you so much.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.273
To the Holy Crown Church!

20:06.306 --> 20:07.507
And step on it!

20:07.540 --> 20:10.510
We stop near there
in 17 stops.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.312
Oh, you don't
understand.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.813
My is daughter is
getting married.
Yeah.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.648
17 stops. Take a seat.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.926
Oh, we're still 16
stops away. I'm so sorry.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.461
I love you, too.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.363
(sighs)

20:30.397 --> 20:34.601
Michael's gonna try and
stall until we get there. Dad?

20:34.634 --> 20:37.370
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Huh. He's staring
 with an intensity of disdain

20:37.404 --> 20:39.906
he reserves only for...

20:39.939 --> 20:43.443
Welcome to the sexiest bus
in Miami!

20:43.476 --> 20:45.845
PRIEST:
 Where is the bride?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.548
You know we have a very limited
window for the ceremony.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.484
She'll be here soon.
We'll just talk fast.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.387
Is everything okay?

20:54.421 --> 20:55.622
Yeah, fine.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.390
ROGELIO:
 I'm fine.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.959
Totally fine.
He doesn't seem fine.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.728
Come on, let's talk.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.864
It'll take my mind off
the fact that I'm...

21:04.897 --> 21:07.534
officially late
to my wedding.

21:07.567 --> 21:11.471
I mean, I understand
your mother needed to move on,

21:11.504 --> 21:13.072
but she could have
slept with anyone.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.408
Why would she pick
the one person

21:15.442 --> 21:17.544
who would hurt me the most?

21:17.577 --> 21:21.881
Well, I guess that's
kind of the point, right?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.616
I mean, she was
obviously really hurt

21:23.650 --> 21:25.418
that you moved on so
quickly with Dina.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.688
She... she just wanted
to hurt you back.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.357
(sighs)

21:30.390 --> 21:32.859
Yes. Okay, that makes sense.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.428
Plus, she clearly
has a type.
What?

21:35.462 --> 21:38.030
Because you and Esteban
are so similar.
(Rogelio gasps, Esteban gasps)

21:38.064 --> 21:40.867
BOTH:
We could not be more different!

21:40.900 --> 21:42.969
Come on, put Esteban
out of your head, okay?

21:43.002 --> 21:45.037
This is your big day!

21:45.071 --> 21:46.773
And mine.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.742
(grunting)

21:49.776 --> 21:52.912
(panting)

21:52.945 --> 21:54.881
(gasps, grunting)

21:54.914 --> 21:56.849
Jane, please stop running.
Your makeup will melt.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.485
Let me carry you!
No way!

21:58.518 --> 21:59.886
Then your
makeup will melt!

21:59.919 --> 22:01.654
You're right! We'll reapply
when we get there!

22:01.688 --> 22:06.826
(panting, groaning)

22:06.859 --> 22:09.061
Shoes.

22:09.095 --> 22:09.962
(shuddering breath)

22:11.698 --> 22:13.600
(chuckles)
Thanks, Dad.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.470
Yeah.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.539
Okay.
Oh.

22:19.572 --> 22:23.443
Okay, go inside and tell Michael
I'm here so he doesn't see me.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.144
On it!

22:25.177 --> 22:27.146
(sighs sharply)

22:27.179 --> 22:30.850
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when she saw him.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.819
(hinges squeak)

22:32.852 --> 22:34.821
Mr. Sweetface!

22:34.854 --> 22:36.723
(laughing):
Hi.

22:36.756 --> 22:37.724
Baby.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.725
Oh.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.726
(kisses)

22:39.759 --> 22:40.960
Oh.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.563
I was just keeping
him occupied.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.466
You look so handsome
I can't stand it!

22:46.499 --> 22:48.568
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And in this moment, friends,

22:48.601 --> 22:50.737
Rafael was sure,
 absolutely sure,

22:50.770 --> 22:53.039
that Jane was about to marry
 the wrong man.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.741
And he was also sure

22:54.774 --> 22:56.943
that it was now or never.
Jane?

22:58.044 --> 23:00.046
I know this is
terrible timing,

23:00.079 --> 23:02.982
but it's kind of like what you
were saying about your writing.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.984
Sometimes you can be
really far down the road,

23:05.017 --> 23:06.819
but you still have
to follow your heart.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.521
What are you talking about?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.923
I love you, Jane.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.592
I always have.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.627
And I always will.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.096
And I think we're
supposed to be together.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.632
So if there's even the
smallest part of your heart

23:19.666 --> 23:21.701
that believes this
to be true, then...

23:21.734 --> 23:23.069
don't marry Michael.

23:23.102 --> 23:26.539
Please don't
marry him.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.175
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And it was true, friends--
 he did love her.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.511
And he saw she was happy.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.714
So how could he ruin that?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.716
Which is why he said nothing.
Ah.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.051
Are you ready to walk
down the aisle, Mr. Sweetface?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.653
Yes?

23:40.687 --> 23:42.522
I'll take
him inside.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.757
Ah...

23:44.791 --> 23:46.793
(sighs)
Good luck.

23:46.826 --> 23:47.994
(sighs)

23:48.027 --> 23:50.730

Dad, you have to sit down now.

Yes. Yes.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.564
PRIEST:
Let us begin.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.866
In the name
of the Father,

24:59.899 --> 25:02.234
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.640
Jane and Michael,

25:07.674 --> 25:09.776
have you come here freely
and without reservation

25:09.809 --> 25:11.911
to give yourselves
to each other in marriage?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.279
BOTH: Yes.
Will you honor
each other

25:13.312 --> 25:16.082
as man and wife
for the rest of your lives?

25:16.115 --> 25:17.850
BOTH: Yes.
Will you
accept children

25:17.884 --> 25:19.586
lovingly from God,

25:19.619 --> 25:21.888
and bring them up according
to the law of Christ

25:21.921 --> 25:24.123
and his Church?
BOTH: Yes.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.993
Since it is your intention to
enter into marriage, please join

25:27.026 --> 25:28.595
your hands...

25:28.628 --> 25:32.198
and declare your consent
before God and his Church.

I, Jane...

25:34.333 --> 25:35.868
take you, Michael,

25:35.902 --> 25:37.637
to be my husband.

25:37.670 --> 25:42.609
I promise to be true to you
in good times and in bad,

25:42.642 --> 25:44.977
in sickness and in health.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.915

* That this

29:21.127 --> 29:23.996
* Could happen to me...

what is wrong?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.300
Nothing. It was lovely.

I probably won't have.

It is. It's just...

Have I introduced you to...

31:04.663 --> 31:06.232
well, my son?

31:06.265 --> 31:08.134
Michael, this is Jerry.
Yeah, I know Jerry.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.202
From when I worked with you
for a week.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.204
Did you know
he has five daughters?

31:12.238 --> 31:14.106
Yeah, of course.
How's Sarah's broken arm?

31:14.140 --> 31:15.641
Cast comes off
next Tuesday.
Oh, good.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.910
He's from Tuscaloosa.
Did you know that?

31:17.944 --> 31:19.245
I didn't.
Mm.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.113
Wow, you guys must be
really close, huh?

31:21.147 --> 31:23.449
We are. Yes.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.650
You should meet my partner,
Susanna.

31:24.683 --> 31:25.985
She's from Tuscaloosa
as well.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.187
Nice. Tell her "Roll Tide!"

31:28.220 --> 31:29.455
Oh. She'll get it.

31:29.488 --> 31:30.689
On special occasions,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.291
we 'Bama natives
say "Roll Tide,"

31:32.324 --> 31:34.226
and then you say
"Roll" back to me.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.028
Roll Tide!
Roll Tide.

Roll!

31:45.537 --> 31:47.239
*
(sighs)

31:47.273 --> 31:50.276
I can't thank you enough, Dad.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.311
Tonight, it's, um...

31:52.344 --> 31:54.546
everything I've ever dreamed.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.647
(laughs softly)

31:55.681 --> 31:57.483
Actually, that's not true.

31:57.516 --> 31:58.985
Because when
I was a little girl,

31:59.018 --> 32:00.319
I never dreamed
that I'd be dancing

32:00.352 --> 32:01.954
with my father at my wedding.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.189
I love you, Jane.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.157
Oh, I love you, Dad.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.258
(cries quietly)

32:06.292 --> 32:08.995
(percussive beat plays)

32:09.028 --> 32:10.997
* Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this? *

32:11.030 --> 32:13.232
* Are you ready for this?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.267
* Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this? *

32:15.301 --> 32:17.236
* Are you ready for this?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.138
* Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this? *

32:19.171 --> 32:21.607
* Are you ready for this?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.475
* Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this? *

32:23.509 --> 32:25.544
What up?!
* Hey, yo, it's time

32:25.577 --> 32:26.612
* To get the party started
Boom!

32:26.645 --> 32:29.548
* It don't take much for me
to Mardi Gras it *

32:29.581 --> 32:31.350
* And I'm fly regardless

32:31.383 --> 32:33.752
* Hands in the air,
time to get rewarded *

32:33.785 --> 32:35.487
* And I'm ready for this

32:35.521 --> 32:37.523
* And I got a couple drinks
that I'm ready to mix *

32:37.556 --> 32:40.159
* And I'm ready to twist, you
won't find it better than this *

32:40.192 --> 32:41.527
* So tell me, baby,
is you ready for this? *

32:41.560 --> 32:44.030
* Are you ready for this?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.697
* Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this? *

32:45.731 --> 32:47.299
* Yeah *

32:47.333 --> 32:48.367
* Are you ready for this?

32:48.400 --> 32:49.435
* You ready for this?

32:49.468 --> 32:50.436
* You ready
for this? *

32:50.469 --> 32:51.537
* Yeah, yeah! *

32:51.570 --> 32:52.771
(cheering)

32:52.804 --> 32:55.474
(whooping, whistling)

32:59.278 --> 33:00.646
(blabbers)

33:00.679 --> 33:04.016
(trills) Elsa laughed
a little while ago.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.452
I'm trying to figure out
what makes Anna laugh.
It's very late, Miss Petra.

33:06.485 --> 33:07.586
Let me put her down?

33:07.619 --> 33:10.322
Sorry. I was just excited.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.359
Elsa's already in the nursery
with Anezka.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.397
(screaming)

33:20.432 --> 33:23.435
(gasping)
(Anna crying)

33:24.770 --> 33:27.739
Helga, uh, call 911. Right away.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.376
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, geez. This is depressing.

33:30.409 --> 33:31.743
Mind if we get back
 to Jane's wedding?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.645
(dance music playing)
(cheering)

33:33.679 --> 33:35.481
Whoa!

33:35.514 --> 33:37.216
Go, Michael!

33:37.249 --> 33:38.517
(Latin Lover Narrator whoops)

33:38.550 --> 33:40.519
What is it with straight
dudes at weddings?

33:40.552 --> 33:42.221
So homoerotic.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.623
(laughs)

33:44.656 --> 33:46.425
(laughs)

33:46.458 --> 33:48.427
Can I just say...

33:48.460 --> 33:49.828
I love you.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.397
I know
it's too quick

33:51.430 --> 33:53.432
to say, but I do.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.134
I love you, too.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.105
(moaning softly)

33:59.138 --> 34:02.108
And I really just want to
have sex with you already.

34:02.141 --> 34:05.111
Oh, God. Me, too.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.646
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, wow. I need some air.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.350
(dance music playing
in distance)

34:16.588 --> 34:17.789
You okay?

34:17.822 --> 34:20.559
Yeah. I just needed
some fresh air.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.194
Felt a little dizzy,

34:22.228 --> 34:23.829
with all the emotions.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.597
Listen,

34:25.630 --> 34:29.501
I'm really sorry...
No.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.571
No need. Stop. I understand.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.141
And, look, if
Esteban makes

34:35.174 --> 34:37.643
you happy for some...

34:37.676 --> 34:39.645
very strange,

34:39.678 --> 34:42.414
inexplicable reason...

34:42.447 --> 34:44.483
Stop. (chuckles) He doesn't.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.851
Thank God.

34:49.855 --> 34:53.292
I want to be with you.

34:53.324 --> 34:57.629
Honestly. And, also...

34:57.663 --> 35:00.366
I still don't want more kids.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.469
So, there you have it.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.272
I want to be with you, too.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.673
Honestly.

35:07.706 --> 35:12.278
But I still do
want kids, so...

35:12.311 --> 35:14.580
So...

35:14.613 --> 35:16.515
nothing's changed.

35:17.483 --> 35:20.186
Actually, that's not true.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.321
Our daughter's married.
(chuckles)

35:22.354 --> 35:26.192
And you threw her the most
beautiful wedding, Rogelio.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.760
*

35:28.794 --> 35:30.362
Dance with me.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.437
* Shine on *

35:38.470 --> 35:41.740
* Shine
 on *

35:41.773 --> 35:48.447
* Ooh...

35:48.480 --> 35:51.583
* Shine on... *

35:51.617 --> 35:54.186
DOCTOR:
It's called locked-in syndrome.
Likely the result

35:54.220 --> 35:55.721
of a mini stroke precipitated

35:55.754 --> 35:58.190
by Anezka's seizure.
She is aware,

35:58.224 --> 36:00.359
but she can't communicate.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.927
All voluntary muscles
in her body are paralyzed,

36:01.960 --> 36:04.930
except for her eyes.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.201
How-how long will it last?
It's good

36:09.235 --> 36:10.802
to set reasonable expectations.

36:10.836 --> 36:14.906
She probably won't improve much,
unfortunately.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.676
But keep talking to her.
She knows you're here.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.981
Can I, uh...

36:23.014 --> 36:24.983
can I have a moment alone
with my sister?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.252
Of course.

36:28.254 --> 36:31.423
I'm outside if
you need me, okay?

36:36.362 --> 36:38.697
(sighs)

36:49.841 --> 36:52.511
(accented):
Don't worry, beautiful sister.

36:52.544 --> 36:56.582
I do what is necessary
to taking good care of Rafael.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.016
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I should explain...

36:58.049 --> 37:00.018
Baby has your sense of humor,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.754
laughing at other's tears!

37:02.788 --> 37:04.323
Oh. I wonder
if this also

37:04.356 --> 37:05.991
will make her laugh.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.294
(gasps)

37:19.438 --> 37:21.740
*

37:33.018 --> 37:34.920
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Poor Petra!

37:34.953 --> 37:37.489
My friends,
 it seems she's been...

37:45.831 --> 37:47.966
(indistinct chatter)

37:51.770 --> 37:54.673
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw, there they go.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.276
(phone chimes)

37:59.678 --> 38:01.447
Xiomara, I know you said

38:01.480 --> 38:02.981
you don't want to see me again,

38:03.014 --> 38:07.653
but perhaps
this will change your mind.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.487
(gasps)

38:09.421 --> 38:10.889
I feel sick.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.325
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Me too. Let's get out of here.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.860
Much better.

38:14.893 --> 38:15.994
Okay, we're about nine minutes
away from Motel 6.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.329
Six if I speed.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.498
Four if I use my siren.
I can't wait.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.733
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I venture to guess that
 no two people have ever been

38:21.767 --> 38:24.336
this excited to spend the night
 at a Motel 6.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.338
What's that?
Oh.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.906
It's a gift for you. I was
gonna give it to you later.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.075
(gasps)
But now's good.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.644
*

38:34.380 --> 38:36.348
(chuckles)

38:36.382 --> 38:39.351
(gasps)
Now it's snowing on the yacht.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.353
Snow makes everything
more romantic.

38:41.387 --> 38:44.523
*

38:48.994 --> 38:50.962
MICHAEL:
 We first kissed in the snow.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.064
This way it's snowing
on us forever.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.712
Do you want a drink?
Or a...

39:06.745 --> 39:08.079
a water?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.919
I just really don't want
to be alone right now.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.756
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.491
I thought you said
you didn't want to do this

39:19.525 --> 39:20.526
if I'm not over Jane.

39:21.827 --> 39:22.928
And I'm not.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.030
And I don't care anymore.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.832
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, that's an about face.

39:29.535 --> 39:33.038
Yeah. Everything's fine.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.542
ESTEBAN BOBBLEHEAD:
I warned you.

39:36.575 --> 39:39.945
I told you
I bust out of condoms.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.784
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I can't believe it.
 It's Michael and Jane.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.786
They're finally doing it!

39:47.819 --> 39:50.422
Oh, no. It's Rafael and Petra!

39:50.456 --> 39:53.391
I mean, Anezka!

39:54.960 --> 39:58.797
Yeah. Leapin' lizards, indeed!

39:58.830 --> 40:01.667
(panting)
Oh. We should

40:01.700 --> 40:03.068
probably...
We should... we sh...

40:03.101 --> 40:05.036
we should leave. Or stay.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.038
Yes. That's a genius idea.

40:07.072 --> 40:10.576
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I had a whole plan.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.810
(panting)

40:15.180 --> 40:16.882
Put that on right now.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.550
Yes, Officer.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.885
Oh.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.624
I'm gonna go get some ice
for the champagne.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.658
Don't go anywhere.

40:26.692 --> 40:27.826
I won't.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.764
(door shuts)
(exhales)

40:32.798 --> 40:34.966
Which brings us here, now...

40:35.000 --> 40:37.969
Hey.
Hey. Congratulations,
Michael.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.071
It was
a really beautiful wedding.
Thank you.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.040
Oh, um,

40:42.073 --> 40:43.775
Tuscaloosa. Roll Tide.

40:43.809 --> 40:44.943
Hmm?

40:48.514 --> 40:51.016
Roll Tide. Then you say...

40:51.049 --> 40:53.018
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Roll.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.820
Go Crimson?

40:54.853 --> 40:56.855
Oh, right. Yeah.
I've heard that.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.958
ARMSTRONG:
 This is your new partner,

40:59.991 --> 41:02.661
Susanna Barnett.
From Tuscaloosa.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.630
Pleased to meet you.
JERRY:
 Tell her Roll Tide.

41:04.663 --> 41:05.964
She'll get it.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.633
You know who used
blue silk ties?

41:07.666 --> 41:10.168
A drug lord that went by
the name Mutter. Look it up.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.504
Cordero's got
a direct line

41:12.538 --> 41:13.371
to Nadine.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.507
Let's fire him,
make a big show of it,

41:15.541 --> 41:18.910
then he can embed himself
with Nadine, see where it leads.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.912
The chip.
That's what this is all about.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.013
So where is it?

41:22.047 --> 41:24.149
It was on me. Literally.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.917
Tech decoded that flash drive

41:25.951 --> 41:27.185
with the criminals
whose faces were changed

41:27.218 --> 41:28.520
by Mutter and Sin Rostro.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.088
And at a million bucks a pop,

41:30.121 --> 41:32.190
that's $200 million
unaccounted for.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.862
(gasps)

41:38.096 --> 41:39.297
It's you.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.799
You're the mole. You've been

41:40.832 --> 41:42.668
leading us to Mutter
this whole time. Why?

41:42.701 --> 41:43.935
Who are you working for?

41:46.137 --> 41:47.973
Oh!

41:56.247 --> 41:59.217
So, we need to leave right now.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.586
Why?

42:06.958 --> 42:09.094
(gasping)

42:13.064 --> 42:15.734
You said you didn't think
you could ever love again,

42:15.767 --> 42:18.770
not the way you loved Rose.

42:22.908 --> 42:25.543
I never stopped loving you,
Luisa.

42:26.778 --> 42:30.215
And you never stopped loving me.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.917
But you were dead.

42:31.950 --> 42:34.252
I-I s... I-I saw you.

42:34.285 --> 42:35.721
That wasn't me.

42:35.754 --> 42:37.222
That was just
to free us.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.925
So now we can
go anywhere.

42:40.959 --> 42:43.795
Don't look so surprised.

42:43.829 --> 42:48.266
You know ours is the greatest
love story ever told.

42:48.299 --> 42:51.937
Now, come on. It's time to go.

42:51.970 --> 42:54.205
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And, friends, she's right.

42:54.239 --> 42:54.973
It is.
