02:25.319 --> 02:27.103
That's what one gets, right?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.217
I'm sorry, I don't
understand what you mean.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.634
Question is, are
you gonna help us?

02:40.943 --> 02:43.511
Like you helped me over there?

02:45.600 --> 02:48.448
You like it when uggs
do things for you, eh?

02:48.472 --> 02:50.344
I'll tell you what, you help us,

02:51.649 --> 02:53.323
and I'll throw in a
decent plate of food

02:53.347 --> 02:55.087
and a bed for the night.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.307
What do you say?

03:47.749 --> 03:48.987
Oh, this is Mary,

03:49.011 --> 03:50.423
who makes sure things
happen around here

03:50.447 --> 03:51.448
the way they should.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.298
Afternoon, Dad, you look tired.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.169
Got to get some rest, right?

03:57.193 --> 03:59.630
But not before you've
introduced me to him.

04:00.718 --> 04:03.393
I'm Paul Mullan.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.809
And I'm Lindsey.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.986
Let's do this, Johnny.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.451
Paul?

04:39.235 --> 04:40.018
Johnny.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.924
Thank you, Mary.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.454
Paul, do you
know where you're going?

06:31.478 --> 06:34.065
I'm sorry, I missed that.

06:34.089 --> 06:37.198
I just asked
where you were headed?

06:37.222 --> 06:40.008
I have no idea.
That's interesting.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.423
If you don't know
where you're headed,

06:44.447 --> 06:46.580
at least tell us where
you're coming from.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.429
I come from Pretoria.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.126
And have you had
enough of Pretoria?

06:52.150 --> 06:53.476
Yes, I have.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.521
And what did...
Lindsey,

06:55.545 --> 06:58.568
I think our guest knows
that the less he says now,

06:58.592 --> 07:01.290
the less he'll regret it later.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.468
So do you live
from one suitcase?

07:08.645 --> 07:09.820
I also have a backpack.

07:12.562 --> 07:16.237
Suitcase and backpack then.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.457
How quickly you
forget, Michelle.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.615
You also arrived here
with only one suitcase,

07:22.746 --> 07:24.400
and look at your wardrobe now.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.493
So, Paul,

07:33.931 --> 07:35.256
seeing as you're undecided
where you're going,

07:35.280 --> 07:38.390
you can't be too
anxious to get there.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.522
No, I'm not.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.480
Well, do you drive?
Yeah.

07:41.504 --> 07:44.483
Do you have a license?
Yes.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.963
Well, then, maybe we
can do each other a favor.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.555
You see, I'm looking
for a new chauffeur.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.644
What?

07:53.560 --> 07:54.711
Oh, it's not hard work,

07:54.735 --> 07:56.495
we don't go out all
that much often.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.607
And you would be paid.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.394
That's not what this is about.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.593
Well, you've gotta do
something to earn some cash.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.967
Unless you're richer
than you look.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.251
And settling down for a
while might be a good thing,

08:13.275 --> 08:15.625
I mean this is as
good a place as any.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.194
Bernard, we know
nothing about him.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.371
Sorry, we just don't know you.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.592
Thank you for your
concern, Johnny.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.683
But we also knew nothing about
you when you started here.

08:30.945 --> 08:33.750
Now, Mary needs some
help in the kitchen

08:33.774 --> 08:35.707
and around the house,

08:35.732 --> 08:38.299
so from now on, you
will be her assistant.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.736
Is that clear?

08:43.304 --> 08:44.087
Good.

08:55.099 --> 08:55.883
Come in.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.828
Do you have a
good pair of black shoes

09:08.852 --> 09:10.114
or must we buy you some?

09:12.290 --> 09:14.573
I have a pair.
That's good,

09:14.597 --> 09:17.620
as we don't know how
long you will be staying.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.646
You know, Mary, you're taking a,

09:21.038 --> 09:23.974
a big chance, inviting a stranger
like me into your house.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.584
Mr Bernard has good instincts.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.326
He believes in taking chances,

09:28.350 --> 09:31.764
but somebody has
been taking too many.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.113
Johnny?

09:33.137 --> 09:35.681
Somebody has been
paying too much attention

09:35.705 --> 09:37.533
to somebody else.

09:39.448 --> 09:42.582
You must make your bed
yourself, I'm not a maid.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.062
Night then.
Goodnight.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.742
Come here.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.265
What does one say?

11:21.289 --> 11:23.770
I suppose one says, please?

11:25.249 --> 11:28.600
Well if one knows what
to say, then say it.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.211
Please.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.415
You've been a very, very bad boy

11:41.439 --> 11:44.834
down there in front
of all those people.

11:48.795 --> 11:52.688
I'm not convinced
you're sorry enough.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.713
I am sorry.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.762
Will Bad Bernard do it again?

12:01.982 --> 12:03.984
No, Bad Bernard won't.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.791
Unfortunately, we both
know that Bad Bernard

12:08.815 --> 12:11.034
is only capable of being bad.

12:16.823 --> 12:17.824
Mm-hmm?

12:22.829 --> 12:23.849
Ah.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.531
Ah, God, you're so beautiful.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.090
Come in.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.357
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.189
Good morning.

14:49.976 --> 14:50.802
Here you go,

14:51.978 --> 14:53.631
if you don't lose
them in this pigsty.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.679
Yes, put them over there.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.459
So,

15:19.483 --> 15:21.921
all this quiet must seem
strange after Pretoria.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.145
I left Pretoria a few weeks ago.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.995
I don't miss the
hustle and the bustle.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.519
Well, I miss Cape Town.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.849
That's where we lived
until about a year ago.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.090
I assumed you'd been
down here your whole life.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.440
No, no, only
after my dad decided

15:43.464 --> 15:44.987
it was time for some downsizing.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.729
Downsizing?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.274
What, so he's not a farmer?

15:51.298 --> 15:53.058
No, no, anything but.

15:53.082 --> 15:56.564
He, he has people who do
things for him, everything.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.134
What exactly is it
that your father does?

16:02.918 --> 16:04.200
Now there's a good question.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.529
He, um,

16:06.443 --> 16:08.421
he's a middleman.

16:08.445 --> 16:09.945
Someone wants to buy something,

16:09.969 --> 16:12.493
someone wants to sell something,
he brings them together.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.472
And now you know
as much as I do.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.627
I don't ask anymore.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.023
I ask too many questions.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.200
Bad habit.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.683
I used to be a cop.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.009
Oh, really?

16:31.033 --> 16:32.121
Why did you leave?

16:33.775 --> 16:34.558
Sorry.

16:37.561 --> 16:40.236
Do you have anyone
special in your life?

16:40.260 --> 16:42.847
No, and I'm not
ready to be someone's

16:42.871 --> 16:44.046
farmer wife quite yet,

16:45.308 --> 16:49.095
but, you know, any
guy after my dad,

16:50.096 --> 16:51.010
big shoes to fill.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.022
You don't need to
bring those through.

17:04.109 --> 17:05.589
Just put them down.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.031
Can we talk?

17:14.598 --> 17:15.469
You can talk.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.646
I don't know what
you want me to say.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.800
Listen, my friend,
it wasn't my intention

17:22.824 --> 17:24.347
to take your job
and chances are,

17:25.869 --> 17:28.240
I'm probably not going
to be here for very long.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.614
How's that, my friend?

17:33.748 --> 17:35.247
I'm here because I'm curious.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.119
I'm trying out the old man,
not the other way around.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.556
If this place doesn't work
out for me, I fuck off.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.624
That's how it works.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.410
And that's your life philosophy?

17:46.543 --> 17:48.241
What do you want
me to do with it?

17:51.766 --> 17:53.115
You can do with it
whatever you want.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.118
Can I give you some free advice?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.083
Be careful around Michelle.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.129
I'm not interested.
Is it?

18:10.306 --> 18:14.136
Some women are just trouble,
no matter who you are.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.663
You think you're in
charge, and then um...

19:25.816 --> 19:27.968
It's rather a humble set-up

19:27.992 --> 19:30.623
but it has its
share of surprises.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.345
The town or this place?

19:34.129 --> 19:37.132
This place, where you can
get anything under the sun.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.589
Why don't you just
tell him, Bernard?

19:39.613 --> 19:40.831
Then he'll also know
what you're on about.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.312
This is where the two of us met.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.596
As a waitress?

19:46.620 --> 19:48.099
She certainly
wasn't the manager.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.862
I didn't stay long enough
to become the manager.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.124
Ah, waiter!

19:53.148 --> 19:55.498
Pour that wine, my good
man, pour that wine.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.107
I trust you enjoyed
your meal, Mrs. Russell?

20:20.131 --> 20:21.718
She's not my wife.

20:21.742 --> 20:24.503
Oh, I apologize, can I
offer you guys some desserts?

20:24.527 --> 20:25.722
And I never eat your dessert,

20:25.746 --> 20:27.071
which tastes like plastic.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.377
Here we are, sir.
You're welcome.

20:28.401 --> 20:31.293
You know, Paul,
people have wondered

20:31.317 --> 20:33.338
if there will ever be
another Mrs. Russell.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.298
As if I'd be so silly
as to take another wife.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.300
Why is that so silly, Bernard?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.171
You know, why make a
fuss of taking something

20:40.195 --> 20:41.738
which you already have,

20:41.762 --> 20:44.523
and be forced to give up
something else in the process?

20:44.547 --> 20:47.309
What would you be
giving away, Bernard?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.072
Money?

20:49.378 --> 20:50.442
I suppose so.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.120
It's always about
money, isn't it?

20:54.165 --> 20:54.905
Paul,

20:56.429 --> 20:59.408
this is the exact same place
where Bernard and I met,

20:59.432 --> 21:01.453
this very same table.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.261
Really?
Hmm.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.221
Well, listen...
He and his wife,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.137
yes, he wasn't alone,
she was with him.

21:11.661 --> 21:15.859
I was wondering, who
could this impressive man

21:15.883 --> 21:17.363
and the attractive woman be?

21:18.407 --> 21:21.256
And then someone told
me it's Bernard Russell.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.561
I'm at their table,

21:22.585 --> 21:24.868
and I better make sure I
give them good service.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.740
Michelle, I don't
think our chauffeur

21:27.764 --> 21:29.612
needs to hear all
these gory details.

21:29.636 --> 21:32.441
They were dressed better
than the other people,

21:32.465 --> 21:34.356
conspicuously so.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.121
Of course, then Bernard
wasn't in his wheelchair yet.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.865
You know what struck me?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.999
People told me he
was Bernard Russell.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.523
Nobody bothered to
tell me her name.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.353
Later I found out
that no one knew.

21:53.399 --> 21:57.533
She was only Mrs. Russell,
who lived on that farm,

21:58.752 --> 22:01.121
and she didn't have
much to say for herself.

22:01.145 --> 22:04.516
Well, I mean, living
on a farm like that,

22:04.540 --> 22:05.648
there's no reason to leave.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.432
No, they said
that Bernard Russell

22:07.456 --> 22:10.174
had bought ground here
just to come and play.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.306
That he had much more important

22:11.330 --> 22:12.655
things to do in Cape Town,

22:12.679 --> 22:15.397
things we simpletons
just wouldn't understand.

22:15.421 --> 22:18.661
My business affairs
are of no concern to anyone.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.426
Oh, absolutely not,

22:21.514 --> 22:23.429
but people can be so curious.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.446
Are you afraid
someone's watching us?

23:04.470 --> 23:06.578
There's no harm in
talking, is there?

23:06.602 --> 23:08.058
No, no, I'm just wondering

23:08.082 --> 23:10.539
if your father's gonna be
needing me any time soon.

23:10.563 --> 23:13.019
No, no, I'm sure
he would have said.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.327
Besides, he usually
rests in the afternoon.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.962
Just don't know if he gets
any rest while she's there.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.899
You really don't
like Michelle, do you?

23:22.923 --> 23:24.272
I, um...

23:25.665 --> 23:27.469
No, it's just...

23:27.493 --> 23:31.777
Well, I uh, might have felt
the same way about any other...

23:31.801 --> 23:35.152
Potentially slutty,
older, evil stepmother.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.568
No, there is absolutely no talk

23:39.592 --> 23:41.420
of me getting a
stepmother quite yet.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.858
Oh, it's just my dad, he uh...

23:46.033 --> 23:47.556
Well, you know
what men are like.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.492
Any woman who knows
what she's doing

23:50.516 --> 23:53.495
can make a man act
like a pet monkey.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.565
And, my dad, he uh,

23:57.523 --> 23:59.022
He's not as hard
as you might think.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.633
You really have
absolutely no idea

24:01.657 --> 24:04.723
what your father does
for a living, do you?

24:04.747 --> 24:08.316
No, just uh, just what
I told you, middleman.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.773
Michelle might know a bit more,

24:10.797 --> 24:12.973
but she would have
asked by now, so,

24:21.460 --> 24:22.698
I thought that you
said that your father

24:22.722 --> 24:23.766
was resting in today?

24:27.988 --> 24:30.662
Yes, he is, it's just um,

24:30.686 --> 24:32.577
one of his acquaintances.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.231
I'm just gonna go see
if they need anything,

24:34.255 --> 24:36.475
Mary can be a bit
stuck-up sometimes.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.921
Are you having a drink with me?

25:11.945 --> 25:13.357
The important
people are up there,

25:13.381 --> 25:15.731
talking about important stuff.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.450
No, thanks.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.042
How can one live in the
Boland and not partake?

25:24.697 --> 25:27.526
Was it because of alcohol that
you left the Police Service?

25:29.745 --> 25:31.593
How would you know
I was in the service?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.333
Did Lindsey tell you?

25:33.357 --> 25:36.099
Nobody needed to tell
me, I knew soon enough.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.864
A lot of policemen had
their hands on your thigh?

25:41.888 --> 25:42.889
Many cops,

25:45.021 --> 25:47.154
have copped a feel.
Hmm.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.854
Eyes and ears everywhere, hey?

25:56.729 --> 25:59.142
But it's okay, I'll let you go,

25:59.166 --> 25:59.949
for now.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.748
The stars are really
out tonight, aren't they?

26:27.368 --> 26:31.304
Times like this I don't
really miss the city.

26:31.328 --> 26:35.570
You know, nothing else can
make you feel so small,

26:35.594 --> 26:37.421
and show you how
little one can plan.

26:39.772 --> 26:42.426
Things happen whether you
plan them or not, right?

26:43.732 --> 26:44.733
What's that saying?

26:45.865 --> 26:48.737
Man makes plans
and uh, God laughs?

26:49.695 --> 26:50.913
Something like that.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.743
Yeah, I sometimes
wonder about that.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.053
Has anyone told
you about my mom?

27:03.839 --> 27:05.425
No.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.930
Well, we don't have
any secrets here, so,

27:10.759 --> 27:12.674
it happened about
um, four months ago,

27:14.720 --> 27:17.548
a month before my dad's
accident on the stairs.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.728
So many things have happened
since we've moved here.

27:25.818 --> 27:29.343
She was never diagnosed as
suffering from depression.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.041
She wouldn't admit it.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.872
My dad, he also never really
talked in that direction,

27:39.745 --> 27:42.748
until the afternoon
in his study.

27:44.619 --> 27:45.359
He uh,

27:46.665 --> 27:49.755
he always kept a pistol
in one of his drawers.

27:51.844 --> 27:52.801
Still does.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.174
I mean, how can you keep
a pistol in the house

27:58.198 --> 27:59.895
if someone suffers
from depression?

28:02.550 --> 28:05.031
But we did and...

28:10.776 --> 28:15.519
You must be wondering why is
this girl telling you a story?

28:17.434 --> 28:18.653
Everyone's story.

28:22.875 --> 28:23.702
And it,

28:25.094 --> 28:27.531
doesn't help that I keep
thinking about it anyway.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.905
Sleep.

30:52.938 --> 30:56.395
Sorry to keep you
waiting, man of mystery.

30:56.419 --> 31:01.294
It's okay, Johnny,
it's expected.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.624
Morning, Paul.

31:07.648 --> 31:08.518
Michelle.

31:11.957 --> 31:12.958
Mary?

31:16.700 --> 31:18.417
Mr. Bernard has a migraine.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.941
Don't worry, I've already
given him something,

31:19.965 --> 31:22.378
but I suppose he'll stay
in bed this morning,

31:22.402 --> 31:25.468
all morning, if
I'm not mistaken.

31:25.492 --> 31:26.580
Right, Miss.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.509
Well, if the boss
won't be needing me,

31:44.076 --> 31:45.991
after breakfast I think
I'll go for a little walk.

32:05.401 --> 32:10.406
<i>♪ Take flight in the
dead of the night ♪</i>

32:11.277 --> 32:16.282
<i>♪ Only shakes me awake</i>

32:17.152 --> 32:21.263

32:21.287 --> 32:25.702

32:25.726 --> 32:28.966

32:32.951 --> 32:37.061

33:16.603 --> 33:20.583

33:20.607 --> 33:22.585
I know I'm supposed
to feel cheap,

33:22.609 --> 33:24.741
because I don't know you,

33:25.786 --> 33:26.787
but I don't.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.619
How did you end up here?

33:33.837 --> 33:37.102
Sometimes it's better
not to know too much.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.431
I know that Bernard's
got a lot of money.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.131
You sound like
a judgmental twat.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.656
You don't understand.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.031
Someone in my position
has a short shelf life.

33:55.424 --> 33:58.166
The wheelchair helps a bit,
so he won't just stroll,

34:00.255 --> 34:02.016
but that's how I
would have reasoned

34:02.040 --> 34:03.737
before I discovered
that I actually

34:04.868 --> 34:07.654
quite like him, sometimes.

34:11.918 --> 34:13.572
You don't love him.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.925
Not the way I'm meant to.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.732
So, what is your full name?

34:22.755 --> 34:23.907
What is this,

34:23.931 --> 34:25.759
an interrogation?
Uhn-uh.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.283
Michelle

34:30.242 --> 34:31.373
Beth Carlson.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.206
Satisfied?
Mmm.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.646
I wish this moment could last.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.650
But, it's always the
wrong ones that do.

34:49.261 --> 34:50.652
What do you wish for?

34:52.438 --> 34:54.657
To find a new beginning,

34:55.702 --> 34:57.182
a new start for me.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.664
What are you trying to
get away from so badly?

35:02.883 --> 35:04.339
Is it really that obvious?

35:04.363 --> 35:07.366
It's that obvious, you
haven't even started to unpack.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.284
I haven't unpacked
for six months.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.243
Running away?

35:20.248 --> 35:21.075
From what?

35:36.308 --> 35:38.266
His name was Mike, my partner.

35:41.661 --> 35:44.229
We'd been looking for this
drug dealer for weeks.

36:34.409 --> 36:38.370
I don't know what was going
on with me that night.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.349
Maybe it was the place.

36:41.373 --> 36:45.266
You know, some places
are just, they're just,

36:45.290 --> 36:46.378
they're evil.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.435
Be quiet!
Shut up!

38:07.459 --> 38:10.157
Shut up, drop that fucking gun!

38:13.073 --> 38:15.356
Shoot him!
Let him go!

38:15.380 --> 38:17.401
Drop your fucking gun!

39:33.806 --> 39:35.416
It was my fault.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.506
No, it wasn't.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.399
You can't blame yourself.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.574
What's the point of being a cop

39:43.598 --> 39:45.184
if you can't even pull a weapon?

39:45.208 --> 39:45.992
Hey.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.390
You can't keep
running away forever.

39:55.610 --> 39:56.394
I know.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.179
Hey.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.532
Unless you've got
a lot of money.

44:23.356 --> 44:26.465
Paul Mullan, I don't believe it.

44:26.489 --> 44:27.621
Hi, Sandra.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.601
I'm,

44:31.625 --> 44:32.713
I'm in the Boland.

44:33.801 --> 44:34.715
What are you doing there?

44:36.282 --> 44:38.632
Yeah, I've started asking
myself the same question.

44:39.851 --> 44:41.089
So you're not calling to say

44:41.113 --> 44:43.091
you're coming back to
me and the Service?

44:43.115 --> 44:45.006
Listen, somebody is trying
to find out more about me

44:45.030 --> 44:46.311
than what they need to know.

44:46.335 --> 44:50.141
Could you, do a
data check for me?

44:50.165 --> 44:53.536
Sure, what's his name?
A John Phillip Dunne,

44:53.560 --> 44:56.998
Phillip with two
Is, D-U double N E.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.851
Nope, nothing,

45:03.875 --> 45:06.834
which means either he's clean
or we haven't caught him yet.

45:07.748 --> 45:08.575
Okay.

45:09.619 --> 45:11.032
Listen, thanks for your trouble.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.816
Oh, wait,

45:12.840 --> 45:13.904
can I ask you one more favor?

45:13.928 --> 45:14.755
One more person.

45:18.324 --> 45:19.867
This is really better

45:19.891 --> 45:21.172
than anything Mary has ever
cooked up, if I wasn't...

45:21.196 --> 45:22.608
I thought I heard you come down.

45:22.632 --> 45:23.653
It would take
more than a migraine

45:23.677 --> 45:25.786
to keep me out of circulation.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.657
I'll bring Mr.
Bernard's food now.

45:27.681 --> 45:28.856
Thank you, Mary.

45:29.857 --> 45:32.793
So, what's been happening?

45:35.863 --> 45:37.667
I'm really glad you're
feeling better, Dada,

45:37.691 --> 45:39.277
but I'm gonna go into town.

45:39.301 --> 45:40.389
Do you need anything?

45:41.869 --> 45:44.065
As if they've got anything
you don't already have.

45:44.089 --> 45:46.415
I can drive.
No, it's okay.

45:46.439 --> 45:47.329
You're not my chauffeur.

45:47.353 --> 45:49.418
He can take you, if you want.

45:49.442 --> 45:50.835
No, it's fine.

45:54.055 --> 45:55.685
I'm also glad
you're feeling better.

45:55.709 --> 45:56.817
Are you now?

45:56.841 --> 45:58.209
Of course.

45:58.233 --> 46:00.821
Okay, now
her I can help you with.

46:00.845 --> 46:04.762
She's been a very busy
girl, Michelle Beth Carlson.

46:05.937 --> 46:08.480
Okay, there's a record
for housebreaking,

46:08.504 --> 46:09.917
drugs,

46:09.941 --> 46:11.788
and then she was a
suspect in a murder case

46:11.812 --> 46:13.398
for a William Gomes.

46:13.422 --> 46:16.184
He was her lover and her mentor,

46:16.208 --> 46:18.403
a little bit older than her.

46:18.427 --> 46:19.709
And he supported her

46:19.733 --> 46:21.387
until the day he took
a dive off a cliff.

46:22.910 --> 46:25.410
They brought her in for
questioning, but she had an alibi.

46:25.434 --> 46:28.196
She was already with
another man that night.

46:56.030 --> 46:57.684
I worry about that girl.

46:59.729 --> 47:02.273
I'm pretty sure she
can take care of herself.

47:02.297 --> 47:04.885
Some girls need looking after,

47:04.909 --> 47:06.824
and her father is always busy.

47:08.390 --> 47:09.933
Don't think I haven't noticed

47:09.957 --> 47:11.829
the way you are
around each other.

47:14.875 --> 47:16.244
You know, you can
notice anything you want,

47:16.268 --> 47:18.009
if your imagination's
strong enough.

47:20.707 --> 47:22.859
I might not have cared.

47:22.883 --> 47:24.905
It might be good for
her, the attention,

47:24.929 --> 47:27.409
if only I could be sure.
Be sure about what?

47:28.933 --> 47:31.718
That it's not all about
the money for you as well.

48:32.257 --> 48:33.911
Paul!

48:39.612 --> 48:41.851
Michelle, what's going on?

48:41.875 --> 48:43.984
Something terrible has
happened, it's Lindsey.

48:44.008 --> 48:46.160
It's my child, she's been taken.

48:46.184 --> 48:49.404
What, Lindsey is taken?
They just called, a man.

48:50.666 --> 48:52.253
Said we'll find her
car near the hotel,

48:52.277 --> 48:53.539
the keys will be inside.

48:55.149 --> 48:57.388
It'll cost a fortune
to get her back.

48:57.412 --> 48:58.389
How much?

48:58.413 --> 48:59.806
3,2 million.
3,2 million?

49:01.025 --> 49:02.983
Oh, fuck the money, I
just want my child back.

49:04.985 --> 49:06.832
We should phone the police.
Fuck it, we won't.

49:06.856 --> 49:08.095
Did they say we shouldn't?

49:08.119 --> 49:09.574
Any idiot knows you shouldn't!

49:09.598 --> 49:11.296
Bernard...
I'm not calling them.

49:12.340 --> 49:13.970
We'll just,

49:13.994 --> 49:15.276
we'll do what he
says, what they say.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.605
He talked about a we.

49:19.608 --> 49:21.088
They're bluffing.

49:24.048 --> 49:25.963
I know this because
I used to be a cop.

49:27.225 --> 49:32.230
Is there anybody here who
didn't know that already?

49:33.492 --> 49:35.122
They have no reason
to harm your daughter.

49:35.146 --> 49:37.080
What did they say
about the handover?

49:37.104 --> 49:38.734
Well, he said he'd call back.

49:38.758 --> 49:40.605
I've got to think this through.

49:40.629 --> 49:42.414
Fuck, he knows what
I'm going to say.

49:43.676 --> 49:46.046
Further instruction
to follow, he said,

49:46.070 --> 49:47.767
and Paul, you must take it.

49:51.292 --> 49:52.076
Me?

49:53.642 --> 49:55.142
How the fuck does
he know about me?

49:55.166 --> 49:57.709
They know about everyone.

49:57.733 --> 49:58.908
And Michelle,

50:00.084 --> 50:02.801
I'm sorry, but you
have to go with him.

50:02.825 --> 50:03.609
What?

50:05.045 --> 50:08.068
They want you to carry the cash.

50:23.324 --> 50:24.325
What next?

51:19.293 --> 51:21.687
So what is next, Johnny-boy?

51:50.716 --> 51:52.302
It's enough to drive you insane.

51:52.326 --> 51:54.807
Come in, Mary, help yourself.

51:56.417 --> 52:00.987
I've convinced her to have
one of these every evening.

52:01.944 --> 52:02.728
May I have one?

52:06.166 --> 52:08.449
You know, Paul, strange that
you come in here just be...

52:08.473 --> 52:10.277
Woah, woah, woah,
you and I meeting,

52:10.301 --> 52:12.496
that was purely,
purely coincidence.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.194
No, no, that's not what I
mean, I'm, I'm glad you're here.

52:14.218 --> 52:16.196
It's just nice to have
someone who's got the balls

52:16.220 --> 52:18.198
to go out and do whatever
it is they want us to do.

52:18.222 --> 52:20.243
Johnny would have shat himself.

52:20.267 --> 52:21.636
Yes, it's just a pity the idea

52:21.660 --> 52:23.140
is not that Paul goes alone.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.360
Sorry for bringing you in.

52:27.318 --> 52:29.450
In for a penny,
in for 3.2 million?

52:31.278 --> 52:33.237
I need to ask you
something, Bernard.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.087
Go ahead.

52:38.111 --> 52:39.306
Anything you want to say to me,

52:39.330 --> 52:40.331
you can say in
front of Michelle.

52:42.507 --> 52:47.164
3.2 million, that's a very
specific amount of money.

52:48.991 --> 52:52.169
Come with me.

53:04.093 --> 53:06.333
Yesterday afternoon,
I had a visitor.

53:06.357 --> 53:08.837
Well, a colleague, call
him that, Ernesto Rodrigo.

53:09.751 --> 53:11.076
We've had some dealings.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.470
Any of it legal?
Some.

53:13.494 --> 53:16.256
Mostly things people
shouldn't know about.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.195
This time I didn't think
it'd be any different.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.721
Here's the 3.2 million
you keep going on about.

53:23.939 --> 53:25.724
See, didn't kill
you, now did it?

53:26.855 --> 53:28.398
So how am I gonna explain this?

53:28.422 --> 53:31.425
I don't care how you
explain it, now bugger off.

53:41.870 --> 53:43.283
Rodrigo was making it
clear that it's him

53:43.307 --> 53:44.849
and he wants it back.

53:44.873 --> 53:45.874
Oh, I know it's him.

53:47.528 --> 53:49.376
Tried to call him myself and
then the fucker didn't answer.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.358
So, I want you

53:52.925 --> 53:53.708
to take this.

54:00.498 --> 54:01.779
No, thanks.

54:01.803 --> 54:03.085
For fuck's sake, Paul,

54:03.109 --> 54:04.304
I'm not asking you
to kill the asshole,

54:04.328 --> 54:06.393
I can have that done later.

54:06.417 --> 54:09.352
What happens if it all goes
wrong, and you're unarmed?

54:09.376 --> 54:11.378
How are you going to
protect the girls?

54:12.379 --> 54:14.425
I'm asking you, Paul, please.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.341
Take it.

54:47.719 --> 54:49.286
Johnny, please tend to Bernard.

55:01.036 --> 55:03.387
He's waiting for them to call.

55:07.216 --> 55:08.609
Have you had any sleep?

55:09.784 --> 55:13.222
Doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.

55:15.529 --> 55:19.466
You're not the only one
who's afraid of weapons.

55:19.490 --> 55:21.381
They scare me to death.

55:21.405 --> 55:24.209
What are you talking about?

55:38.160 --> 55:38.944
Yes?

56:03.882 --> 56:05.381
You could have said no.

56:05.405 --> 56:08.341
You didn't have to come with.

56:16.068 --> 56:19.637
Well, you do realize how
much money is on the back seat.

56:31.953 --> 56:34.521
We have to do the right thing.

57:07.206 --> 57:08.686
It's gonna be okay.

57:27.792 --> 57:28.575
Hello?

57:32.013 --> 57:34.601
We brought the money.

57:34.625 --> 57:36.453
Is that who we need?

58:30.071 --> 58:31.571
It's a bomb, Michelle.

58:31.595 --> 58:34.336
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

58:39.733 --> 58:42.451
Shh, shh, huh-uhn, huh-uhn,
look at me, look at me.

58:42.475 --> 58:44.279
Look at me, look at me.

58:44.303 --> 58:45.565
Shh, you're okay.

58:46.784 --> 58:48.437
You're okay, okay?

59:55.766 --> 59:57.376
I'll get it stopped.

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.962
You're okay, we're okay.

01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:22.662
We're okay.

01:00:28.755 --> 01:00:29.819
We're okay.

01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:31.976
You're okay, you're okay.

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:36.807
Okay, okay.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.769
You're okay, you're okay.

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:44.858
Ready?
Okay.

01:01:57.191 --> 01:01:59.411
Bernard wants to see us
all in the sitting room.

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:06.786
I presume you're sufficiently

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.376
pleased with yourself, Mr. Hero.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.685
That's what you
think this is about?

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.428
You don't have the guts.

01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:21.825
Anyway, now you're
his right hand,

01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:25.480
the one that he
wipes his ass with.

01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:34.141
When was the last time
someone gave you a fat lip?

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:40.887
I am so grateful to
have all of us here,

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:43.368
especially you, my child.

01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.239
My Dada.

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.523
Things could have
turned out so differently,

01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:49.896
were it not for you, Paul,

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.293
and you, Michelle.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:58.402
First of all, let's put all this

01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:00.951
unpleasantness behind us.
Somebody died today.

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:03.997
He's not bothering anyone now.

01:03:05.564 --> 01:03:08.804
Anyway, someone will come
across that bastard's body

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:10.893
at some stage or
another, who cares.

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:13.137
That's not how it works.

01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:20.642
Anyway, now on to
more pleasant things.

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:25.168
I have my child back,
which is as it should be.

01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:30.197
And I have you, Michelle.

01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:38.791
Thank you, Michelle.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:39.598
Thank you.

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:48.085
Michelle, Michelle, Michelle?

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:57.746
Would you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:03.554
What?

01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:05.667
I'm asking you to
marry me, sweetheart.

01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:11.108
I...

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:15.808
Yes!

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:22.554
We must celebrate.

01:04:24.773 --> 01:04:27.013
Let's get the champagne,
I'll show you where it's kept.

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:29.430
I know where it is.

01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:31.084
Oh.

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:34.044
I um,

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:36.089
I feel...

01:04:38.178 --> 01:04:39.832
Well, I don't know how I feel.

01:04:41.921 --> 01:04:43.159
We should uh,

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:45.074
all go out tonight.

01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:46.423
Celebrate, just the four of us?

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:47.729
We can do that right here.

01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:50.974
No, Dada, please, not
after news like this.

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:53.822
My treat.

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:54.716
I insist.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.112
Then how can I say no to you?

01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:03.247
Excuse me.

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.281
You're snooping on
half the people there.

01:05:18.305 --> 01:05:21.004
Sounds to me like you're
ready to rejoin the force.

01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:24.137
Ernesto Rodrigo...

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:33.035
Okay, do you want the
good news or the bad news?

01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:34.341
The hell with you, Sandra,

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:36.430
it's always the good
news and the bad news.

01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:38.519
Okay, well,
there's a lot on him.

01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:42.436
He has not exactly
been mummy's best boy,

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.592
but he's out of your
reach, unfortunately.

01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:46.919
What do you mean?

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.988
Well, your friend
Rodrigo got arrested.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.271
When, recently?

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:54.211
Very recently, as
in yesterday evening.

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.842
Yesterday evening?

01:05:57.866 --> 01:06:00.019
He's in for money laundering

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.456
and money from organized crime,

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.917
and it looks like his
bail hearing is tomorrow.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.443
Paul, are you there?

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:12.359
Uh, yes, I'm still here.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.582
I have to go, I'll
call you back.

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:22.108
Did I interrupt you?

01:06:23.544 --> 01:06:24.304
No.

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:26.045
No, no, not at all.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.611
I just uh, came to say

01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:30.353
that Dad isn't really
feeling too well.

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:32.529
Must be all of the excitement.

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:35.532
Should have seen it coming,
another one of his migraines.

01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:36.340
Daily.

01:06:37.732 --> 01:06:38.971
Yes,

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.713
and I think I should
also not go out tonight.

01:06:42.737 --> 01:06:44.063
I think I should
stay here with him,

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:46.089
but you and Michelle
should still go.

01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:49.068
No.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:50.417
No, that's not a good idea.

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.027
Sure you can,

01:06:52.051 --> 01:06:54.184
and Dad also thinks
it's a good idea,

01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:58.144
and I've already booked
the table, half past seven.

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:00.427
Mary's also got the evening off,

01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:04.107
so you and Michelle
deserve a evening off-duty.

01:07:05.064 --> 01:07:07.327
Please, just let
me do that for you?

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.482
Well, what about you?

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.397
Are you gonna be okay?

01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:17.618
I'm good, I'm home now, okay?

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:20.664
And that Rodrigo man
won't be so stupid

01:07:20.688 --> 01:07:22.168
as to try anything again.

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:25.452
No.

01:07:25.476 --> 01:07:26.975
Come on.

01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:27.782
Say yes.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:32.961
Yes.

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.360
Hi.

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:06.580
Hi, Lindsey, are
you sure about this?

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:08.190
Yes, yes, please!

01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:11.933
Go, enjoy yourselves, my dad
and I need a bit of alone time.

01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:14.849
And it gives you and
Paul a chance to speak.

01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:16.068
Well, we don't really

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.113
have much to say...
Just get to know him.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.288
Tell me what you think.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:21.314
You've got plans.

01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:25.492
Let's just say I hope
he'll stay here for a while.

01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:28.210
Would you do me a favor?

01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:30.212
I wanna go attend to that
dear old father of mine.

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:33.301
He will get out of bed and
come sit down here with me,

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:35.174
but would you mind
taking this to Mary,

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:38.176
just before she has to
come pour one for herself?

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:39.376
Of course.

01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:35.171
So, what's bothering you?

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:36.823
Nothing.

01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:42.002
Come on, spit it out.

01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:48.401
There are two things
that are bothering me.

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:52.468
The first thing is that the
man that you shot this morning

01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.494
was not Ernesto Rodrigo.

01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:59.238
It was a helper, someone
who was working with him.

01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:02.826
I'm not so sure about that.

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:06.656
I don't think Ernesto Rodrigo
had anything to do with it.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.180
He was arrested the day
before any of this went down,

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.770
I spoke to a colleague of mine.

01:10:13.383 --> 01:10:15.839
Okay, maybe he
set it all in motion

01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.319
and then when he got arrested,

01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:20.259
the helper continued
with the plan.

01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:26.613
That's possible.

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:30.530
So what's the other thing?

01:10:31.923 --> 01:10:33.229
You said yes.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.992
What else could I do?

01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:39.515
What is that supposed to mean?

01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:41.367
You know how I feel.

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:43.848
No man can be that dense.

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:47.634
I also know how
you feel about money.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:52.987
Okay, look, if I had
to choose yesterday,

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:55.314
I might have made
the wrong choice,

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:58.055
like so often in the past.

01:10:58.079 --> 01:11:00.319
We have to make
a decision tonight.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.364
We can't do it at the house.

01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:04.845
I want it to be with you.

01:11:04.869 --> 01:11:06.499
You sure about that?

01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:09.284
I'm used to moving on,
Michelle, I don't think you can.

01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:11.852
Okay, it does scare me.

01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:15.096
I had everything
planned so well, but,

01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:19.425
for a long time I was
also used to moving on,

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:22.321
and now I want to
do that with you.

01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.375
To us.

01:12:33.914 --> 01:12:35.481
Lindsey!

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:10.449
Lindsey, you're still awake.

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:12.581
Of course I'm still
awake, Michelle.

01:13:12.605 --> 01:13:15.062
Paul, are you gonna
have a nightcap with me?

01:13:15.086 --> 01:13:15.976
No, thanks.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:16.716
I've had enough to drink.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:17.978
I'm gonna go up to bed.

01:13:18.002 --> 01:13:20.676
No, no, no, no,
no, please, I insist.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.591
A drink with my savior?

01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:25.313
Besides, I have something
I wanna discuss with you.

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:28.752
Okay.

01:13:29.579 --> 01:13:31.383
Night, Michelle.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.515
It's best if you go
up quietly and uh,

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:36.475
don't turn the lights on.

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.215
Good night.

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:41.329
Both of you.
Thank you, for tonight.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.144
Okay.

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:22.762
Things have changed
since you got here, Paul.

01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:31.597
And, I really feel like
I've gotten to know you,

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:34.426
or maybe I just don't
know enough men.

01:14:35.688 --> 01:14:38.430
Well, that's a shame for all
the young men in this area.

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:42.652
Well, that is the right answer,

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:45.544
but maybe the men around here

01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:47.526
aren't exactly
what I had in mind.

01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:58.557
Bernard?

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.800
Some of my things aren't
here, did you take them?

01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:05.762
Bernard?

01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:08.721
You know what I'm on about.

01:15:10.288 --> 01:15:11.550
I'm not gonna hint anymore.

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:13.552
Don't do this.

01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:18.011
You've only had eyes for her
since the day you got here.

01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:19.558
Well if you knew that, why?

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:24.104
Why are you doing this?

01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:26.715
Well, maybe I uh,

01:15:26.739 --> 01:15:28.654
have a head for
business, like my dad,

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:32.591
or maybe I'm just
being realistic.

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:35.008
One can't have everything,
but you can have enough.

01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:39.230
And you, Paul, must look
out for you own interests.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:43.515
Look, I'm gonna
put this plainly.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.647
I'm gonna inherit
a lot of money,

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:47.151
probably sooner than you think.

01:15:49.196 --> 01:15:51.740
I'm not making you
a bad offer, Paul.

01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:52.809
Lindsey, this is,

01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.615
not what love is about.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.530
It's exactly what love is about.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.730
You either take what
you want or you buy it.

01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:04.603
You've inherited too many
of your father's bad habits.

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:11.194
I may have, but
be that as it may,

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:12.742
is that your final answer?

01:16:16.746 --> 01:16:17.573
Yes.
Hmph.

01:16:21.315 --> 01:16:22.099
Bernard?

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:28.192
Now, that is the wrong answer.

01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:36.853
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:37.984 --> 01:16:38.768
Michelle!

01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:45.011
What the fuck is going on?

01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:46.403
You took your time joining us.

01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:47.709
Lindsey?

01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:51.017
It's a long story,
Paul, but we have time.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:53.410
Mary won't be joining
us this evening.

01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:56.176
She's taken something a little
bit stronger than brandy.

01:16:58.526 --> 01:16:59.615
Michelle saw to that.

01:17:01.921 --> 01:17:03.682
Do you know why you gave her

01:17:03.706 --> 01:17:05.969
something to sleep, Michelle?

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:10.190
'Cause you wanted to steal this,

01:17:11.714 --> 01:17:13.605
and that brings us to
the person responsible

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.607
for all of us being
here this evening.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:16.825
Lindsey.

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.827
Your chance to
speak is long gone.

01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:21.221
My child...
Don't you my child me!

01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:24.311
You were supposed to bite the
dust a long time ago, Dada,

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:26.772
that day when you took
your little spill.

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:32.580
But, my child, why.

01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:34.538
Why?

01:17:34.562 --> 01:17:36.279
You know why.

01:17:36.303 --> 01:17:37.087
Because of her.

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:39.655
Lindsey.

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:42.503
It's not too late to stop.

01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:43.615
Lindsey, please.

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:46.855
I know what you've
done to your dad,

01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:49.292
but just let, let
us go, whatever.

01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:52.034
We won't say anything
to anyone, I promise.

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:54.297
You were already
planning to leave, Paul.

01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:55.322
No, don't.

01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:57.803
It was so much money.

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.328
Here's the 3.2 million
you keep going on about.

01:18:02.547 --> 01:18:04.810
You see, it didn't
kill you, now did it?

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:06.812
Now bugger off.

01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:10.836
There was a chance
you'd see that

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.447
the bomb wasn't all
that great, but,

01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:15.797
obviously you weren't
an explosions expert

01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:17.040
while you were a policeman.

01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:22.412
Do you know how
easy it is to uh,

01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:25.918
get a helper if you want to
do anything vaguely criminal?

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:28.070
We live in a country

01:18:28.094 --> 01:18:29.617
where you can hire
anyone for anything.

01:18:30.749 --> 01:18:32.727
I should really thank
Johnny for that.

01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:36.035
It was one of his old friends,

01:18:36.059 --> 01:18:38.646
someone who knew enough
about bombs to uh,

01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.213
make it look real,
set the scene.

01:18:40.237 --> 01:18:43.893
And when the time was right,
I could activate it myself.

01:18:49.594 --> 01:18:50.876
You know, Paul, if you had uh,

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.815
cut that green wire
instead of red,

01:18:55.165 --> 01:18:57.796
then absolutely nothing
would have happened.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.909
You would have also
made the right choice.

01:19:01.475 --> 01:19:04.890
But uh, you were supposed
to take the money that day,

01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:07.177
and I would have escaped
and come back here,

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.897
and that would have been the
first of his punishments,

01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:14.227
the fact that Michelle
had run away with you,

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:16.403
all on her own.

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:19.798
The guy wasn't supposed
to try and steal the bag.

01:19:21.365 --> 01:19:23.933
And you weren't
supposed to shoot him.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:28.217
Now, Paul.

01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:29.741
I have a little task for you.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.873
What the fuck do
you want with me?

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.267
You seem to be doing
just fine on your own.

01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:38.034
No, sometimes
you do need a helper,

01:19:39.557 --> 01:19:40.926
like Johnny over here.

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:42.928
He's very loyal, if it's to me

01:19:42.952 --> 01:19:44.799
or the money he'll be getting,

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:46.520
doesn't really matter, does it?

01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:49.610
But here's what people
will think happened.

01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:51.937
You and Paul knew
about the money

01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:54.069
and you wanted to steal it,

01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:55.679
and Johnny and I woke
up from the noise,

01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:58.639
but we were too late.

01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:02.623
My dad tried to stop
you, but, you shot him.

01:20:04.974 --> 01:20:06.865
Here you go, Mr. Hero.

01:20:06.889 --> 01:20:08.954
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:20:08.978 --> 01:20:09.935
That's debatable.

01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:12.218
Take it.

01:20:12.242 --> 01:20:14.655
Your story's not
gonna wash, Lindsey.

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.265
If your dad was
trying to stop us,

01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:18.833
how are you gonna explain me
shooting him with that gun?

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.574
You took it from
him, that's all.

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:22.948
Now either you shoot
him, or I shoot her.

01:20:27.648 --> 01:20:30.347
Looks to me like you need a
little bit of convincing, Paul.

01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:38.007
Lindsey, please.

01:20:40.052 --> 01:20:42.335
Don't do this, you're
gonna regret it.

01:20:42.359 --> 01:20:44.990
No police psychology
for me, thanks,

01:20:45.014 --> 01:20:47.253
but let me make it
easier for you, Paul.

01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:50.323
Let me tell you what kind
of man is lying there.

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:53.631
That day...

01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:14.233
So, now you know, Paul.

01:22:15.887 --> 01:22:17.802
Do what you have to do.

01:22:20.457 --> 01:22:21.240
One.

01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:29.945
Two.

01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:34.751
Paul, you need to
stop me, remember?

01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:38.190
I can't, I can't, I can't do it!

01:22:38.214 --> 01:22:40.216
I can't do it, Michelle,

01:22:42.827 --> 01:22:44.022
I can't do it.

01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:46.483
Paul, no!

01:22:49.007 --> 01:22:50.245
Obviously things aren't

01:22:50.269 --> 01:22:52.054
working out the way
they were supposed to,

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.580
but that's life.

01:23:01.019 --> 01:23:01.759
Go.

01:23:08.896 --> 01:23:10.115
Take the bag, go.

01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.509
Your stuff's already packed.

01:23:13.858 --> 01:23:16.880
And Paul, you should get
that wound looked at.

01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:18.056
The bullet is from
this revolver,

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.646
it will be found in his hand.

01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:28.307
Now, since you don't wanna
see what happens next,

01:23:29.221 --> 01:23:30.179
I suggest you leave.

01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:32.833
But Lindsey...
No.

01:23:37.838 --> 01:23:41.494
Maybe it's best if
I do it, for her.

01:23:52.418 --> 01:23:53.743
I feel like I'm fucking dying.

01:23:53.767 --> 01:23:55.595
We're going to
get you to a doctor.

01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:05.712
Paul!

01:24:05.736 --> 01:24:07.105
Paul, look at me.

01:24:07.129 --> 01:24:08.217
Look at me.

01:24:09.218 --> 01:24:11.655
Oh, shit, ugh, ugh.
Paul!

01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:14.286
Look at me.

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:15.765
Breathe.

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:19.271
You're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be okay.

01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:22.970
Do you remember
what you wished for?

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:25.234
What?

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:29.238
A fresh start.

01:24:30.456 --> 01:24:31.544
This is it.

01:24:32.676 --> 01:24:34.895
This is our new beginning.

01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:38.464
As fugitives?

01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:42.686
I love you.
