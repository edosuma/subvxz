15:37.583 --> 15:38.583
Right!

15:38.667 --> 15:39.750
[Rebecca Cunningham] Right!

15:39.875 --> 15:42.000
Now hold on, Becky.

15:42.125 --> 15:45.709
It may not be my plane anymore.
They're my tires. I go!

15:45.792 --> 15:49.083
OK. Let's pull chocks.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.542
We're off to bag us a lightning gun.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.333
[Baloo] <i>Don't look, Karnagee,</i>

16:11.417 --> 16:14.125
<i>but we're coming to</i>
<i>bust up your lawn party.</i>

16:14.208 --> 16:15.875
Karnagee?

16:17.041 --> 16:20.125
Tell me, what's your name?

16:20.250 --> 16:23.250
So I can carve it on your tombstone!

16:23.333 --> 16:26.208
<i>Ha ha ha. Name's Baloo.</i>

16:26.291 --> 16:28.250
<i>And me, Kit Cloudkicker.</i>

16:28.375 --> 16:31.000
I am not believing this.

16:31.083 --> 16:34.208
That stupid pilot and the kid, too?

16:34.750 --> 16:37.750
That make me very, very angry.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.917
Blow them away!

16:48.000 --> 16:51.208
Time to lightning up their lives.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.041
Fire!

17:02.041 --> 17:03.667
What? Again!

17:05.208 --> 17:07.834
-[Kit Cloudkicker] We did it!
-[Baloo] It worked!

17:09.040 --> 17:10.375
Get him!

17:11.208 --> 17:14.959
Wahoo! [laughs] Nothing can stop us now.

17:18.458 --> 17:19.458
Baloo!

17:21.791 --> 17:24.250
Hold on! I'll try losing them.

18:14.417 --> 18:17.750
If you can't fly,
don't mess with the eagles.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.333
They're still coming?

18:21.458 --> 18:24.750
Quick! Close the beak! Close the beak!

18:30.166 --> 18:32.417
We are not gonna make it, are we?

18:32.500 --> 18:35.083
Don't know, Becky, but we'll try.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.291
Faster! Faster! Close it faster!

18:39.417 --> 18:40.917
Sorry about this, baby.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.417
We're in a Talespin.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.291
I can't hold her steady.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.917
Just give me a few more seconds, baby.

19:11.959 --> 19:14.625
Hmm. A pity.

19:15.375 --> 19:17.834
That was a pilot to be reckoned with.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.417
Scramble the planes.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.959
Kit!

19:29.625 --> 19:30.625
Baloo!

19:44.709 --> 19:45.959
My plane.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.542
To your posts, men.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.041
We will fight to the last man!

20:03.542 --> 20:06.375
Then again, retreat! Retreat!

20:06.792 --> 20:08.750
Full speed behind!

20:17.417 --> 20:18.542
Mommy!

20:18.667 --> 20:20.500
Guys! You did it!

20:20.917 --> 20:22.208
Yeah.

20:22.291 --> 20:23.583
We did it.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.583
[Baloo] Go away!

20:30.000 --> 20:32.583
[Kit Cloudkicker] Just come out and fly.

20:32.667 --> 20:35.917
[Baloo] Without the <i>Duck, </i> I'm grounded.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.375
Hey, give me that back!

20:38.917 --> 20:40.875
Stop being such a baby.

20:41.333 --> 20:45.000
It's been a week since Ms. Cunningham
and Molly got an apartment.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.583
And all you've done is
sit around on your duff!

20:48.625 --> 20:50.583
A week? I haven't flown in a week?

20:51.542 --> 20:54.583
OK, well, let's see this plane of Becky's.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.417
Come on, Baloo. You'll love it.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.500
Yeah, yeah. Don't blow a gasket.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.792
What?

21:03.375 --> 21:04.333
Surprise!

21:04.333 --> 21:05.750
Happy new year!

21:05.834 --> 21:07.959
That's the surprise!

21:08.041 --> 21:09.834
The <i>Sea Duck!</i>

21:09.917 --> 21:13.041
Good as pretty and twice as new.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.041
My baby!

21:15.917 --> 21:17.041
Well...

21:17.125 --> 21:18.625
Actually...

21:19.250 --> 21:20.291
She's my baby.

21:20.375 --> 21:24.125
I paid to have it put back together
piece by piece, I own it again.

21:24.208 --> 21:25.208
But--

21:25.291 --> 21:28.625
So you going to be my pilot or what?

21:35.041 --> 21:36.875
What do you say, Papa Bear?

21:40.709 --> 21:43.208
Wahoo!

21:44.542 --> 21:48.792
I'm just doing this
until I can buy the <i>Duck </i> back.

21:48.959 --> 21:52.500
-Of course
-I can't be tied down.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.542
[Rebecca Cunningham] Oh, right, Baloo.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.083
[Baloo] About that name.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.208
I still don't like Higher for Hire.

21:59.750 --> 22:00.667
[Rebecca Cunningham] Ha ha ha.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.417
Get used to it, Baloo.
