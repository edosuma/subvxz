♪

00:16.193 --> 00:17.169
I love driving back.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.423
I looked for a place down here
when I got my gold shield.

00:19.448 --> 00:20.651
So, what happened?

00:20.652 --> 00:22.385
Well, one month's rent
on a one-bedroom

00:22.387 --> 00:23.970
costs more than my car.

00:23.972 --> 00:26.556
Yeah. What's wrong
with Brooklyn anyway?

00:26.558 --> 00:28.925
Nothing, but, I mean,
check this out--

00:28.927 --> 00:30.677
it's beautiful,
it's safe.

00:30.679 --> 00:32.795
Well, judging
by the call we just got,

00:32.797 --> 00:34.981
I don't think
it's that safe.

00:34.983 --> 00:36.866
What do we got?

00:36.868 --> 00:38.451
Ted Kramer,
Wall Street guy.

00:38.453 --> 00:40.286
Gunshot to
the head.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.541
Close range.

00:44.543 --> 00:46.793
They didn't take
his fancy watch.

00:46.795 --> 00:48.294
No signs of forced entry?

00:48.296 --> 00:49.796
No, Detective.

00:49.798 --> 00:51.631
It's a serious security system.

00:51.633 --> 00:54.317
Checked it. Disabled.
Whoever pulled the trigger

00:54.319 --> 00:57.370
probably took care of that
after this guy let him in.

00:57.372 --> 00:59.872
No signs of a struggle,
nothing stolen.

00:59.874 --> 01:01.391
I don't think it's a burglary.

01:01.393 --> 01:02.926
Looks like a professional hit.

01:02.928 --> 01:06.479
Question is, who'd want. Kr?

01:07.431 --> 01:09.215
<i>Don't take this</i>

01:09.217 --> 01:10.350
the wrong way.

01:10.352 --> 01:12.318
You drive just like
my grandmother.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.572
Yeah, well, you drive like my
brother when he was 14, so...

01:15.574 --> 01:17.991
You can't drive
till you're 16, chief.

01:17.993 --> 01:18.588
Exactly.

01:18.613 --> 01:20.854
I'm just saying, it's not like
you're gonna get a ticket.

01:21.112 --> 01:23.913
Well, if I do, it's not like my
rich dad is gonna pay it for me.

01:23.915 --> 01:26.065
Boy Scout.
Daddy's girl.

shots from behind that car.

01:52.027 --> 01:53.610
Okay.

01:55.029 --> 01:57.380
Go, go, go!

01:58.115 --> 01:59.765
Police! Drop your weapons!

02:02.903 --> 02:04.037

02:04.039 --> 02:05.771
No.

02:15.532 --> 02:17.783
You're not getting out of here!

02:22.756 --> 02:23.940
Drop your weapon!

02:23.965 --> 02:25.809
Drop it! Put 'em on the ground
right now! On the ground!

02:25.810 --> 02:27.927
On the ground! Put 'em down!
On the ground now!

02:27.929 --> 02:30.430
On the ground!
Hands behind your head!

On the ground!

02:32.350 --> 02:34.600
Central, 12 David.
Keep 'em coming.

02:34.602 --> 02:35.768
I got two under.

02:35.770 --> 02:36.769
One fled the scene.

02:39.973 --> 02:41.741
Stay here.

02:48.182 --> 02:51.234
Why'd you have to shoot him?
The kid was unarmed.

02:52.887 --> 02:55.621
Hey. Hey, what happened?

02:55.623 --> 02:57.173
He had a gun.
I had no choice.

02:57.175 --> 03:01.094
That cop shot him in the back!
He didn't have a gun!

03:01.096 --> 03:03.012
He's just a damn kid!

03:03.014 --> 03:05.264
Central, 12 David.
I need a bus forthwith

03:05.266 --> 03:07.350

03:07.352 --> 03:08.501
regarding one male shot.

03:08.503 --> 03:11.020
Oh. Where's the gun?
What happened?

03:11.022 --> 03:12.388
Uh, I don't know.
Calm down.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.273
I've been trying to
stop the bleeding.

03:16.611 --> 03:17.777
He didn't have
no damn gun!

03:17.779 --> 03:19.529
You shot him
for no reason!

03:19.531 --> 03:21.564
All right, all right,
hey, calm down. All right.

03:21.566 --> 03:24.033
All right, back up!
Central, 12 David.

03:24.035 --> 03:26.119
I'm requesting a 10-85,

03:26.121 --> 03:29.872
regarding large disorderly crowd
at this location, forthwith.

03:29.874 --> 03:31.690
All right, calm down!
Hey, back up!

03:31.692 --> 03:34.026
Back up!
Hey, back up!

03:34.028 --> 03:36.195
The current unrest
on Clinton Street began

03:36.197 --> 03:40.083
when 14-year-old Marcus Green,
fleeing purported gang members,

03:40.085 --> 03:42.251
was chased by NYPD officer
James Montero,

03:42.253 --> 03:44.554
who then shot the youth
in the back.

03:44.556 --> 03:47.056
There's no word on the boy's
condition at this time.

03:47.058 --> 03:49.042
So far, police
haven't engaged protestors,

03:49.044 --> 03:52.678
but violence
is clearly escalating.

03:54.015 --> 03:56.566
Kid died on the table
five minutes ago.

03:56.568 --> 03:58.217
Five minutes from now,

03:58.219 --> 03:59.652
the news will hit the street.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.053
Like a bombshell.

04:01.055 --> 04:02.355
We're ready.
How?

04:02.357 --> 04:03.906
Sheer numbers,
for starters.

04:03.908 --> 04:06.526
Contain the crowd without
inciting further violence.

04:06.528 --> 04:08.077
It's easier said than done.

04:08.079 --> 04:10.947
They are to stand down
unless directly attacked.

04:10.949 --> 04:12.749
What about attacks
on private property?

04:12.751 --> 04:14.951
I will not have someone shot
over a plateglass window.

04:14.953 --> 04:16.753
What are they saying?

04:16.755 --> 04:18.087
Witnesses claim
that Green was unarmed,

04:18.089 --> 04:21.673
including local shop owner
Marta Dominga.

04:21.676 --> 04:23.543
Marta, please. Thank you.
Thank you for talking to us.

04:23.545 --> 04:25.762
Can you please tell us what
happened and what were your thoughts.

04:25.764 --> 04:27.547
Well, the cops come
into this neighborhood

04:27.549 --> 04:29.788
and they treat everyone
like a damn criminal,

04:29.813 --> 04:30.717
and we're sick of it!

04:30.718 --> 04:32.885
This is not right at all,
because this boy

04:32.887 --> 04:34.687
was 14 years old.

04:34.689 --> 04:36.189
Did he have a gun?

04:36.191 --> 04:38.141
No, he had not gun.
And that's not right.

04:38.143 --> 04:40.810
I mean, what about us?
What about <i>our</i> neighborhood?

04:40.812 --> 04:43.062
We need some protection, too...

04:43.064 --> 04:44.814
They find the weapon yet?

04:44.816 --> 04:47.900
Not yet. All due respect, boss,
we can't put that fire out

04:47.902 --> 04:49.202
with just a squirt gun.

04:49.204 --> 04:50.987
Do we have trained officers
on the scene?

04:50.989 --> 04:51.937
Yes.
Then let's put

04:51.939 --> 04:53.322
that training
to good use.

04:53.324 --> 04:55.458
We will play for a tie
until further notice.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.126
Yes, sir.
I am late

04:57.128 --> 04:59.212
for my briefing with the mayor.
Sir, Montero's

04:59.214 --> 05:01.547
a good officer--
no need to play defense here.

05:01.549 --> 05:05.784
We got a 14-year-old boy
shot dead by one of our own.

05:05.786 --> 05:08.421
The reality is, public sentiment
is going to dictate

05:08.423 --> 05:10.223
how some of this goes.

05:10.225 --> 05:12.308
Just trying to stand up
for our guy.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.427
I'll stand up for him.

05:14.429 --> 05:17.480
Let's just hope
he did the right thing.

We were hoping you could
help us out with that, Mr. Phillips.

05:56.844 --> 05:59.695
Did Mr. Kramer have
any enemies you knew about?

05:59.697 --> 06:01.514
He was a wonderful guy.

06:01.516 --> 06:03.149
He was a great partner.

06:03.151 --> 06:04.683
People loved him.

06:04.685 --> 06:06.202
No issues
at the office,

06:06.204 --> 06:08.287
pissed-off clients, nothing?

06:08.289 --> 06:09.789
No.

06:10.857 --> 06:13.125
There was a small disagreement

06:13.127 --> 06:15.911
between Teddy
and the other partners recently.

06:15.913 --> 06:17.997
Oh. What about?
Well, Teddy wanted

06:17.999 --> 06:19.582
to bring in a new partner,

06:19.584 --> 06:23.219
some art dealer--
zero experience in securities.

06:23.221 --> 06:24.887
But it's his company, right?

06:24.889 --> 06:26.138
Yes. But...

06:26.140 --> 06:28.224
under the partnership agreement,
he still has to get

06:28.226 --> 06:30.593
majority approval
to bring someone new aboard.

06:30.595 --> 06:32.595
Which I'm assuming
he didn't get.

06:32.597 --> 06:35.047
The only thing
this guy brought was capital,

06:35.049 --> 06:37.549
and we're coming off
a record year, so he...

06:37.551 --> 06:38.901
was rejected.

06:38.903 --> 06:40.352
How'd Kramer take it?

06:40.354 --> 06:42.021
Not well.
He stopped

06:42.023 --> 06:44.323
coming to the office,
wouldn't answer his calls.

06:44.325 --> 06:47.326
I hadn't spoken to him in a week.
This art dealer

06:47.328 --> 06:49.728
that Kramer wanted to bring in,
did he have a name?

06:49.730 --> 06:51.247
Teri Damiri.

06:51.249 --> 06:52.915
Family's loaded.
They've got a gallery

06:52.917 --> 06:53.999
up on Madison.

06:54.001 --> 06:55.668
Sounds familiar.
Is that that guy

06:55.670 --> 06:58.337
that hangs out at the clubs
with the movie stars?

06:58.339 --> 07:01.590
Another reason we didn't want
his name on the letterhead.

07:05.245 --> 07:07.630
<i>I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to ask you again,</i>

07:07.632 --> 07:09.915
Frank, do you have
a credible witness

07:09.917 --> 07:12.268
who says he saw
the kid had a gun?

07:12.270 --> 07:14.937
The incident is under
investigation, Mr. Mayor.

07:14.962 --> 07:15.755
Don't give me

07:15.756 --> 07:17.056
the company line, Frank.

07:17.058 --> 07:18.808
I am following procedure,

07:18.810 --> 07:20.776
and procedure dictates
we interview

07:20.778 --> 07:23.779
<i>every</i> possible witness,
not just the kangaroo court

07:23.781 --> 07:25.264
TV puts on.

07:25.266 --> 07:27.032
And who would be
a credible witness to you?

07:27.034 --> 07:28.868
Another cop?
Oh, come on.

07:28.870 --> 07:30.769
We both know that won't fly.

07:30.771 --> 07:32.204
You're damn right, it won't--
the people

07:32.206 --> 07:33.606
in the community
have eyesight, too.

07:33.607 --> 07:34.790
I'm not saying they don't.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.408
You don't lean
toward them, do you?

07:36.410 --> 07:38.294
You always lean toward your own.

07:39.796 --> 07:44.083
If you're playing
some race card here, save it.

07:44.085 --> 07:46.952
I am not playing
a race card.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.511
You and me,

07:55.513 --> 07:57.396
we're better than that...

07:57.398 --> 07:59.315
and I know that.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.102
But the card I <i>am</i> playing...

08:04.988 --> 08:08.741
Six months ago I was shot
by a kid from the projects.

08:08.743 --> 08:11.277
A minority <i>kid.</i>

08:11.279 --> 08:14.313
And every day I wish one of yours
had beat him to the draw.

08:14.315 --> 08:16.465
But, Frank, wishing it
won't make it so.

08:16.467 --> 08:18.834
No more than you wishing
that the people's beef

08:18.836 --> 08:20.402
with your department's
use of force

08:20.404 --> 08:22.588
is 100% unfounded.

08:22.590 --> 08:26.258
You know I want
to work with you here.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.994
And I hope you know...

08:28.996 --> 08:32.847
that I would like
to lighten your load if I can.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.683
I do know that.

08:34.684 --> 08:36.684
What can I do?

08:36.687 --> 08:40.139
I'm gonna hold a press
conference on the shooting.

08:42.442 --> 08:44.275
I wa you to be there.
I already

08:44.278 --> 08:45.895
released a statement.

08:46.897 --> 08:49.281
We have a full-scale riot
on our hands, Frank.

08:49.283 --> 08:51.066
A statement is not gonna cut it.

08:51.068 --> 08:53.619
I am not gonna hang
my officer out to dry

08:53.621 --> 08:55.537
before I have
all the facts.

08:55.539 --> 08:56.688
No one is asking you to.

08:56.690 --> 08:59.191
Well, somehow it always
turns out that way.

08:59.193 --> 09:01.710
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, Frank.

09:03.663 --> 09:06.081
Now, when do we get
the Internal Affairs report?

09:06.083 --> 09:08.050
72 hours.

09:08.052 --> 09:11.720
If Officer Montero
is found negligent,

09:11.722 --> 09:14.006
he <i>will</i> pay the price.

09:14.008 --> 09:15.341
If Officer Montero
is found negligent,

09:15.343 --> 09:17.059
I'm gonna do everything
in my power

09:17.061 --> 09:18.978
to see that he's charged
with murder.

09:20.847 --> 09:23.299
That'll be the price of that.

09:43.370 --> 09:45.204
Teri Damiri?

09:45.206 --> 09:47.206
Thank you, Natasha.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.707
Welcome, Detectives.

09:48.709 --> 09:51.377
Are you in the market

09:51.379 --> 09:53.012
Eh, something tells me
this stuff's

09:53.014 --> 09:55.247
a little bit
out of our price range.

09:55.249 --> 09:57.582
True beauty has no price.

09:57.584 --> 09:58.269
Hmm.

09:58.294 --> 10:00.347
Yeah, so, you and Ted
Kramer were friends?

10:00.805 --> 10:03.489
I loved Teddy. I can't
believe what happened.

10:03.491 --> 10:05.858
We understand you wanted
to partner up with his firm.

10:05.860 --> 10:08.277
Teddy needed
a little cash infusion.

10:08.279 --> 10:09.895
He was good customer,

10:09.897 --> 10:11.947
and a hell of a guy.
I was trying to help him out.

10:11.949 --> 10:14.599
Hm. His partners said
they had plenty of dough.

10:14.601 --> 10:16.201
Look, Teddy made
a few deals

10:16.203 --> 10:18.103
his associates
didn't know about.

10:18.105 --> 10:20.939
Big-money plays
with considerable risk.

10:20.941 --> 10:22.658
And you offered to step in?

10:22.660 --> 10:24.159
Yeah, but it didn't work out.

10:24.161 --> 10:26.795
It made no difference to me;
clearly I don't need the money.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.580
But I felt bad for Teddy.

10:28.582 --> 10:30.332
He was in a tough spot.

10:30.334 --> 10:32.051
He's in a tougher spot now.

10:32.053 --> 10:34.453
You know who might
have killed him?

10:34.455 --> 10:37.956
A lot of bad guys out there.

10:42.479 --> 10:44.963
<i>I have to be honest</i>

10:44.965 --> 10:46.798
with you, Counselor,
I'm a little surprised

10:46.800 --> 10:48.434
your client is in this office.

10:48.436 --> 10:50.602
I've advised
Officer Montero he has

10:50.604 --> 10:52.104
no obligation to speak to you.

10:52.106 --> 10:53.739
And yet, here he is.

10:53.741 --> 10:55.657
This is a proffer session.
Nothing my client says

10:55.659 --> 10:57.159
can be used against him.

10:57.161 --> 11:00.979
Unless he contradicts himself
in future testimony.

11:00.981 --> 11:02.614
We're hoping it
doesn't come to that.

11:02.616 --> 11:04.416
In light of the public outcry,
with many prominent leaders

11:04.418 --> 11:06.702
speaking out against my
client, we are concerned

11:06.704 --> 11:08.787
that department brass

11:08.789 --> 11:10.539
may encourage
the IAB to...

11:10.541 --> 11:14.877
sacrifice Officer Montero
in order to keep the peace.

11:14.879 --> 11:16.495
"Department brass"?

11:16.497 --> 11:18.597
Oh, I'm not here to disrespect
anyone's family.

11:18.599 --> 11:20.466
My client deserves a fair shake,

11:20.468 --> 11:22.667
and we feel the D.A.'s
investigation offers

11:22.669 --> 11:24.186
his best shot to get it.

11:26.056 --> 11:29.725
I'd like to hear your version
of what happened.

11:29.727 --> 11:32.161
I chased the suspect
onto a crowded street.

11:32.163 --> 11:34.646
I ordered him to stop.
Instead, he turned around,

11:34.648 --> 11:36.949
aimed a weapon at
me, so I fired.

11:36.951 --> 11:38.517
Was your gun drawn
the whole time?

11:38.519 --> 11:41.420
Yes. The original call
was shots fired.

11:41.422 --> 11:44.073
I-I couldn't be sure
if he had a gun.

11:44.075 --> 11:45.857
Are you certain he had one?
I didn't see it

11:45.859 --> 11:48.377
at first, but,
when he turned back toward me,

11:48.379 --> 11:50.896
he had a weapon in his hand.
It was

11:50.898 --> 11:52.581
a stressful situation.
Is there any chance

11:52.583 --> 11:53.999
you might be mistaken?

11:54.001 --> 11:55.801
No way.

11:55.803 --> 11:58.921
Why wasn't a gun found
at the scene?

12:04.177 --> 12:05.811
I don't know.

12:05.813 --> 12:08.180
Neither do I.

12:09.149 --> 12:12.017
I know this looks bad,
but I swear to God...

12:12.019 --> 12:14.403
I fired in self-defense.

12:14.405 --> 12:16.772
I could see
he was just

12:16.774 --> 12:18.857
a kid.

12:18.859 --> 12:21.994
I didn't want to hurt him.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.616
The death of Marcus Green,
regardless of circumstance,

12:39.764 --> 12:41.161
is a tragedy.

12:41.162 --> 12:42.912
I want to assure
the public

12:42.914 --> 12:44.380
that the shooting
is being investigated

12:44.382 --> 12:47.617
and the full results
will be released shortly.

12:47.619 --> 12:49.619
Until then,

12:49.621 --> 12:51.621
I urge restraint and calm.

12:51.623 --> 12:55.041
The last thing this city needs
is further violence.

12:55.043 --> 12:58.711
I echo the commissioner's call
for restraint.

12:58.713 --> 13:01.681
This is a terrible incident,

13:01.683 --> 13:03.883
but the public needs
to remain calm.

13:03.885 --> 13:05.468
Does this shooting fit into

13:05.470 --> 13:07.270
a larger pattern
of excessive force

13:07.272 --> 13:09.606
by the NYPD
in minority neighborhoods?

13:09.608 --> 13:11.941
There is no evidence
that Officer Montero

13:11.943 --> 13:14.110
used excessive force...
But it most certainly

13:14.112 --> 13:16.396
does leave a lot
of unanswered questions.

13:16.398 --> 13:19.315
This tragedy fits
in a well-established

13:19.317 --> 13:20.984
and disturbing trend.

13:20.986 --> 13:24.053
The use of excessive force
in minority

13:24.055 --> 13:26.623
and poor communities
is a grave concern.

13:26.625 --> 13:27.857
And one that I promise

13:27.859 --> 13:29.409
will not be tolerated.

13:29.411 --> 13:30.727
When our children
aren't safe, our city

13:30.729 --> 13:32.111
isn't safe.

13:32.113 --> 13:33.796
Commissioner!

13:38.118 --> 13:40.169
<i>Hey.</i>

13:40.171 --> 13:41.620
You come up with anything?

13:41.622 --> 13:43.723
Oh, the only thing I get
from Kramer's financial records

13:43.725 --> 13:46.926
is that I definitely chose
the wrong profession.

13:46.928 --> 13:48.561
"Cash withdrawal:

13:48.563 --> 13:51.097
80 grand, 100 grand, 200 grand"?

13:51.099 --> 13:53.266
What's this guy spending
his money on?

13:53.268 --> 13:54.934
Oh. Here we go.

13:54.936 --> 13:56.469
The cash was wired
to various casinos,

13:56.471 --> 14:00.156
the Borgata, Mandalay Bay,
Foxwoods.

14:00.158 --> 14:02.641
Close to two million bucks
in all.

14:02.643 --> 14:03.660
Son of a bitch.

14:03.662 --> 14:05.778
He's a degenerate gambler.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.613
With very deep pockets.
Yeah, kind of guy

14:07.615 --> 14:10.750
gets himself in too deep
and gets himself popped.

14:10.752 --> 14:12.418
You know what?
Let's take a ride.

14:12.420 --> 14:13.670
Come on.
Where are we going?

14:13.672 --> 14:15.605
I got a C.I. who's in
the gambling business.

14:15.607 --> 14:17.840
He'll let us know if this
guy got himself whacked

14:17.842 --> 14:19.959
for not paying his marker.

14:22.796 --> 14:25.848
Hey, do you have anything
on Officer Montero?

14:25.850 --> 14:28.434
Graduated third in his class
from the police academy,

14:28.436 --> 14:31.137
earned a citation
for community outreach.

14:31.139 --> 14:33.106
You try his C.O.?

14:33.108 --> 14:35.024
Says Montero's
an exemplary officer.

14:35.026 --> 14:37.643
Uh...

14:37.645 --> 14:39.445
it looks like our Marcus Green

14:39.447 --> 14:41.147
is not as innocent
as we thought.

14:41.149 --> 14:42.732
He's got a juvenile record.

14:42.734 --> 14:44.484
Those records are supposed
to be sealed.

14:44.486 --> 14:47.787
Yeah, I've got friends
in low places.

14:47.789 --> 14:49.739
"Marcus Green...

14:49.741 --> 14:54.410
"arrested for carrying
a loaded .38-caliber pistol

14:54.412 --> 14:56.796
when he was 12."
Doesn't mean he was armed

14:56.798 --> 14:58.614
when Montero shot him
in the back.

14:58.639 --> 15:00.033
No.

15:00.034 --> 15:03.169
But it does mean we have
a lot more work to do.

15:09.693 --> 15:12.745
Might look like any other
nondescript dive,

15:12.747 --> 15:14.897
but it's actually
the biggest book east of Vegas.

15:14.899 --> 15:16.882
How come OCCB
doesn't shut it down?

15:16.884 --> 15:19.051
Most of their best snitches
work out of here.

15:19.053 --> 15:20.770
And there's ours.
Lester,

15:20.772 --> 15:23.940
you're killing me. I bailed
your ass out 100 times, Lester.

15:23.942 --> 15:25.724
Come on, Lester.

15:25.726 --> 15:27.410
Le...
Lester,

15:27.412 --> 15:30.580
Gary's got to go now.
Have a nice day.

15:30.582 --> 15:31.914
Nice.

15:31.916 --> 15:34.733
Working a homicide. You do
remember police work, right?

15:34.735 --> 15:36.002
Hum a few bars.

15:36.004 --> 15:37.920
Detective Baez, Gary Heller.

15:37.922 --> 15:40.173
Believe it or not,
Gary used to be on the job.

15:40.175 --> 15:41.374
You were a cop?

15:41.376 --> 15:42.959
Narcotics.

15:42.961 --> 15:46.512
Till the, uh, unpleasantness.

15:46.514 --> 15:48.514
Unpleasantness being
he lost a kilo.

15:48.516 --> 15:50.633
A kilo went missing
under his watch.

15:50.635 --> 15:52.718
You ever speak
to the Jamaicans you framed?

15:52.720 --> 15:54.554
Why dwell on the past?

15:54.556 --> 15:57.043
I make a lot more dough taking
bets and the hours are better.

15:57.068 --> 15:58.475
I'm sure.

15:58.476 --> 15:59.592
You're a lot
more fetching

15:59.594 --> 16:01.144
than his last partner.
All right,

16:01.146 --> 16:03.362
knock it off. I need you
to focus, okay?

16:03.364 --> 16:04.447
You know Ted Kramer?

16:04.449 --> 16:06.399
Kramer? Hmm.

16:06.401 --> 16:09.902
The broker that got popped
in Tribeca, right?

16:09.904 --> 16:11.604
Yeah, and he liked to gamble.

16:11.606 --> 16:13.456
Lot of folks do.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.878
Okay.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.130
Kramer was a player.
Mm-hmm.

16:21.132 --> 16:22.465
High-stakes poker.

16:22.467 --> 16:24.083
Bet big, lost bigger.

16:24.085 --> 16:27.220
He ran around with a rich
art dealer, a Damiri.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.555
They gamble together?

16:29.557 --> 16:32.141
Uh, lo   , guys...

16:32.143 --> 16:34.894
getting into
a sensitive area here.

16:34.896 --> 16:36.512
Is Damiri a player or not?

16:37.932 --> 16:39.432
Uh...

16:39.434 --> 16:41.350
he was more of a businessman.

16:41.352 --> 16:42.819
Meaning?
Meaning

16:42.821 --> 16:44.821
he set up games
for his big-money pals.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.272
And keep a piece
of the action

16:46.274 --> 16:47.440
for himself.

16:47.442 --> 16:49.808
That's the American way, honey.
We done?

16:49.810 --> 16:51.027
No.

16:51.029 --> 16:52.578
Say this Kramer lost big.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.197
Was he into Damiri?

16:54.199 --> 16:56.199
You kidding me, Danny?

16:56.201 --> 16:57.834
No, I'm not kidding you, Gary.

16:57.836 --> 17:02.004
Damiri uses Russian muscle
to police his games.

17:02.006 --> 17:04.656
He's in business
with the Russian mob.

17:04.659 --> 17:06.209
Those guys got
no sense of humor.

17:06.211 --> 17:07.676
I'm done talking.

17:07.679 --> 17:08.661
No, you're not.

17:08.663 --> 17:11.263
Was Kramer into Damiri?
Yes or no.

17:14.101 --> 17:18.671
Kramer was in a seven-figure
hole with Damiri.

17:18.673 --> 17:21.607
That's a bad place
to be.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.726
You guys were never here.

17:39.576 --> 17:41.544
Action to me?

17:43.247 --> 17:44.863
$75,000.

17:44.865 --> 17:46.365
Bet's to you.

17:46.367 --> 17:47.967
I call.

17:51.054 --> 17:53.205
$75,000. You, sir.

17:53.207 --> 17:55.174
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

17:55.176 --> 17:57.476
we are the police.
This game is officially over.

17:57.478 --> 17:58.978
Sir, why don't you drop
that bottle.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.479
Everybody get your hands onto
the table where we can see 'em

18:00.481 --> 18:02.815
with your palms up.
Give those three a toss over here.

18:02.817 --> 18:04.317
Make sure they're not carrying.

18:04.319 --> 18:05.518
Step back, sir.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.903
What the hell is going on?!

18:06.905 --> 18:08.271
Just the man I'm looking for.

18:08.273 --> 18:09.989
Turn around.
You're coming with us.

18:09.991 --> 18:11.741
We have almost 400 grand in this pot.
Hey, you can

18:11.743 --> 18:13.583
walk away now or you can count
your winnings in jail.

18:13.608 --> 18:14.411
Hey, hands up.

18:14.412 --> 18:16.729
You guys are making
a big mistake.

18:16.731 --> 18:19.665
The only one making a mistake here
is you with your little gambling operation.

18:19.667 --> 18:23.068
It's just poker, Detective.
It's a victimless crime.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.037
Tell that to Ted Kramer.

18:25.039 --> 18:27.340
Get your ass out of here.

18:40.026 --> 18:41.742
Get a good night's sleep?

18:41.744 --> 18:44.378
You could've questioned me
last night and then released me.

18:44.380 --> 18:47.031
But what fun would that be?
Guess he didn't like the holding cell.

18:47.033 --> 18:48.666
We just wanted to
give you a chance

18:48.668 --> 18:50.417
to see how the other half lives,
you know?

18:50.419 --> 18:52.336
Sort of a sneak preview for you.

18:52.338 --> 18:55.372
Please. I host poker games
for my friends

18:55.374 --> 18:57.424
so they can have
a little privacy and relax.

18:57.426 --> 18:58.759
What's the big deal?

18:58.761 --> 19:01.879
You keep a piece of every pot--
that illegal.

19:01.881 --> 19:03.797
I got to pay for the room,

19:03.799 --> 19:06.684
the staff, refreshments.

19:06.686 --> 19:08.385
And what about
your Russian friends?

19:08.387 --> 19:09.953
There's a lot of
cash flying around.

19:09.955 --> 19:12.940
I like my guests to feel safe.

19:12.942 --> 19:14.391
And what happens
to your guests

19:14.393 --> 19:15.976
when they don't make
good on their debts?

19:15.978 --> 19:18.228
Are you guys serious?

19:18.230 --> 19:19.396
Dead serious.

19:19.398 --> 19:22.349
I sell art, okay? To collectors

19:22.351 --> 19:25.402
all over the world.
I don't kill people.

19:25.404 --> 19:27.654
And the thugs at the hotel?
Look,

19:27.656 --> 19:29.456
poker's something I do for fun

19:29.458 --> 19:31.041
to help out my friends.

19:31.043 --> 19:34.027
Sort of like the way
you helped out Ted Kramer.

19:34.029 --> 19:36.196
Listen carefully.

19:36.198 --> 19:38.165
Okay.
The most powerful people

19:38.167 --> 19:39.750
in this city play my games,

19:39.752 --> 19:42.970
along with the billionaires
who get them elected.

19:42.972 --> 19:44.221
They're all in my book:

19:44.223 --> 19:46.757
names, dates,
amounts won and lost.

19:46.759 --> 19:50.344
It's my little insurance policy.

19:50.346 --> 19:52.396
Insurance policy against what?

19:52.398 --> 19:53.514
You.

19:53.516 --> 19:54.982
These people
don't want to...

19:54.984 --> 19:56.817
read about their gambling habits
in the newspaper.

19:56.819 --> 19:58.652
It's bad for business.

19:58.654 --> 20:00.904
So if you're smart,
you'll back off

20:00.906 --> 20:02.573
before you get yourselves
in serious trouble.

20:02.575 --> 20:04.191
And if you're
really smart,

20:04.193 --> 20:05.826
you'll tell us everything
you know

20:05.828 --> 20:07.561
about the murder of Ted Kramer.

20:07.563 --> 20:09.246
Oh.

20:09.248 --> 20:11.031
Yeah?

20:11.033 --> 20:14.201
Thank you. Good morning.

20:14.203 --> 20:15.452
Hi, Teri.

20:15.454 --> 20:17.287
Good morning, Bruce.

20:17.289 --> 20:20.424
Detective, are you gonna, uh,
charge him with anything?

20:20.426 --> 20:22.543
Not at this time, no.

20:22.545 --> 20:24.011
So I'm gonna take him with me.

20:24.013 --> 20:27.514
Good to see you. Thank you.
You, too. Bruce.

20:30.418 --> 20:35.088
Remember, Detective, a smart
player knows when to walk away.

20:35.090 --> 20:37.274
I'll remember that.

20:37.276 --> 20:39.943
Let's go. Give my best
to your father.

20:39.945 --> 20:42.980
- He's a good man. - I will.
Have a good day.

20:48.453 --> 20:50.487
Five.

20:50.489 --> 20:51.905
Come on, number five.

20:51.907 --> 20:53.490
Come on, number five.
Number five.

20:53.492 --> 20:54.958
Number f...

20:54.960 --> 20:58.745
You should be pulling
a hansom cab.

20:58.747 --> 21:00.798
We need to talk.

21:01.666 --> 21:02.883
Now.

21:07.088 --> 21:08.722
You're like a recurring
nightmare, Reagan.

21:08.724 --> 21:10.957
What are you doing here?
I missed you.

21:10.959 --> 21:12.426
You sat down
at Damiri's top game.

21:12.428 --> 21:14.461
That's the biggest game in town.
Will you relax?

21:14.463 --> 21:16.346
Nobody's gonna trace it
back to you. - No?

21:16.348 --> 21:18.632
They will if you keep
showing up here.

21:18.634 --> 21:20.634
Come on.
Stop your hyperventilating.

21:20.636 --> 21:23.303
You owe me, Danny.
You owe me big-time.

21:23.305 --> 21:25.189
No, I don't owe you
a damn thing. You owe me.

21:25.191 --> 21:26.824
Now, I need you
to confirm something

21:26.826 --> 21:28.992
that Damiri told us.
He says he's got a black book

21:28.994 --> 21:30.577
with a list
of all the games in it.

21:30.579 --> 21:31.862
He calls it his...

21:31.864 --> 21:34.031
Yeah, his insurance policy,
yeah.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.916
Yeah. So it's legit?

21:35.918 --> 21:39.152
Yes, it's legit.
And there's names in there

21:39.154 --> 21:41.538
that you wouldn't believe.
Now, are you gonna back off?

21:41.540 --> 21:43.990
No. I just need to know
what I'm dealing with.

21:43.992 --> 21:46.927
Well,
then you should know...

21:46.929 --> 21:51.465
there's a name in Damiri's book
that hits real close to home.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.600
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:54.435 --> 21:56.854
Your home.

22:01.943 --> 22:05.028
You got a minute, Gramps?

22:05.030 --> 22:07.147
For you?

22:07.149 --> 22:09.066
I'll clear my busy schedule.

22:09.068 --> 22:10.951
Uh, working a homicide.

22:10.953 --> 22:14.421
This, uh, big shot Wall Street
guy got himself whacked.

22:14.423 --> 22:16.907
I'm surprised it doesn't
happen more often.

22:16.909 --> 22:18.909
Yeah. Seems he got in
over his head

22:18.911 --> 22:20.244
in a mobbed-up poker game.

22:20.246 --> 22:22.462
That'll get you
killed, all right.

22:22.464 --> 22:25.249
The guy we're looking at
runs the poker game.

22:25.251 --> 22:26.833
He's a party-boy art dealer,

22:26.835 --> 22:29.469
goes by the name
of Teri Damiri.

22:33.708 --> 22:36.176
You know, this Teri Damiri
keeps a black book

22:36.178 --> 22:38.645
with all of his clients' names
in it, Gramps.

22:39.514 --> 22:41.565
Your name's
one of them.

22:41.567 --> 22:45.218
Please tell me
that's a mistake.

22:49.574 --> 22:51.575
Look...

22:51.577 --> 22:52.726
Gramps.

22:52.728 --> 22:53.893
I got tired

22:53.895 --> 22:55.895
of beating the retired cops
I play with.

22:55.897 --> 22:57.748
I went looking
for a bigger game.

22:57.750 --> 23:01.901
Bigger game? The game I broke up
has a $200,000 buy-in.

23:01.903 --> 23:03.787
How much bigger
are you looking for?

23:03.789 --> 23:06.740
That's the top game.
Mine was only 15.

23:06.742 --> 23:08.508
15 grand?
Yeah.

23:08.510 --> 23:10.127
Gramps, are you crazy?!

23:10.129 --> 23:12.763
It's not like I've got to pay
a mortgage or something.

23:13.165 --> 23:15.648
It's an illegal poker game.

23:15.650 --> 23:16.639
You're the former commissioner.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.407
What happens
if your name comes out?

23:18.409 --> 23:19.692
That's my problem.

23:19.694 --> 23:21.494
No. It becomes Dad's problem,

23:21.496 --> 23:22.945
the current commissioner,

23:22.947 --> 23:25.331
who's got the inspector general
hanging around his neck!

23:25.333 --> 23:26.532
He doesn't need this!

23:26.534 --> 23:30.202
And I don't need a lecture
from you.

23:36.176 --> 23:38.260
<i>I saw a bunch of people</i>

23:38.262 --> 23:41.430
on TV throwing bottles
and stuff at a police car.

23:41.432 --> 23:43.933
Well, they were angry
at what they felt

23:43.935 --> 23:45.634
was an injustice.

23:45.636 --> 23:47.353
You mean, that kid
getting killed?

23:47.355 --> 23:48.521
Yeah.

23:48.523 --> 23:49.772
You know, guys,
we talked about this

23:49.774 --> 23:50.591
on the way over here.

23:50.592 --> 23:52.082
I don't think we need
to go over it again.

23:52.107 --> 23:53.109
Listen to your mom.

23:53.110 --> 23:55.510
His name was Marcus.
He was a year older than me.

23:56.646 --> 23:58.364
I want to hear
what Grandpa thinks.

23:59.366 --> 24:00.950
The officer told him to stop,

24:00.952 --> 24:02.651
and he didn't, and I think...

24:02.653 --> 24:05.237
So, that makes it
okay to shoot him?

24:05.239 --> 24:06.539
It's complicated, Sean,

24:06.541 --> 24:08.741
and all the facts
haven't come out yet.

24:08.743 --> 24:11.210
But he shot him
in the back.

24:11.212 --> 24:13.528
There's more to it than that,
and I promise you,

24:13.530 --> 24:16.248
that officer did not set out
to kill that boy.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.917
Well, I doubt
Marcus Green woke up

24:17.919 --> 24:19.585
that morning expecting to die.
Nicky!

24:19.587 --> 24:21.870
Nicky's entitled
to her opinion.

24:23.056 --> 24:24.223
I talked to Montero's partner.

24:24.225 --> 24:26.976
He said that James is
a basket case over this.

24:26.978 --> 24:28.644
Well, I'm sure that that kid's
family is hurting, too.

24:28.646 --> 24:30.563
Yeah.

24:30.565 --> 24:33.548
Lot of pain to go around when
something like this happens.

24:33.550 --> 24:35.100
Pain and blame.

24:35.102 --> 24:36.268
So,

24:36.270 --> 24:38.320
is Officer Montero
gonna go to jail?

24:38.322 --> 24:41.556
If he is indicted, he will stand
trial just like anyone else.

24:41.558 --> 24:42.691
That's right.

24:42.693 --> 24:45.244
Not even cops
are above the law.

24:45.246 --> 24:47.413
Ain't that right, Gramps?

24:51.117 --> 24:53.702
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

24:53.704 --> 24:54.920
Mm-hmm.

24:54.922 --> 24:56.705
You know, I read an
article in the <i>Times.</i>

24:56.707 --> 24:59.091
Cops hardly ever get indicted
for shootings like this.

24:59.093 --> 25:01.410
The <i>Times</i> mention
that Officer Montero was doing

25:01.412 --> 25:03.078
the best job
that he could?

25:03.080 --> 25:04.913
Can't ask much more
than that from a guy.

25:04.915 --> 25:06.465
Boys, sometimes cops

25:06.467 --> 25:09.969
only have a split second to make
a life-or-death decision.

25:09.971 --> 25:12.221
But he's still responsible
for his actions, right?

25:12.223 --> 25:14.223
- Absolutely.
- We all are.

25:14.225 --> 25:16.892
We're all responsible
for all of our actions

25:16.894 --> 25:20.145
all of the time...
all of us.

25:21.615 --> 25:23.399
And if you live

25:23.401 --> 25:25.600
long enough, you're bound
to make some mistakes.

25:25.602 --> 25:26.935
It's what's called

25:26.937 --> 25:28.487
being human.

25:29.572 --> 25:33.275
So best not to sit
in judgment.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.790
Can I ask you
a question?

25:48.792 --> 25:50.042
Shoot.

25:50.044 --> 25:52.978
We say family comes first
around here.

25:55.432 --> 25:57.299
Is that no matter what?

25:58.485 --> 26:01.636
This have something to do
with what I saw at dinner?

26:06.393 --> 26:09.662
It would help if I knew
what we were talking about.

26:10.563 --> 26:12.665
It's just a question, Dad.

26:14.651 --> 26:16.869
Yes.

26:16.871 --> 26:19.088
Family comes first.

26:19.923 --> 26:21.924
Okay.

26:21.926 --> 26:24.259
Good night.

26:36.222 --> 26:38.307
Hey.

26:38.309 --> 26:41.176
Want some breakfast?

26:41.178 --> 26:44.313
No, I'm all right,
but I do need to talk to you.

26:44.315 --> 26:46.565
Your Marcus Green investigation.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.993
When I first reviewed the file,

26:57.995 --> 27:02.331
I thought
Officer Montero had screwed up.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.199
And now?

27:04.201 --> 27:06.418
I interviewed Montero.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.703
He is convinced
that Marcus Green had a gun.

27:08.705 --> 27:11.757
And I know for a fact that kid
is no stranger to firearms.

27:11.759 --> 27:14.593
No witnesses, no weapon.
I know.

27:14.595 --> 27:19.214
I also know that members of
that community rarely cooperate

27:19.216 --> 27:21.183
with investigators.

27:21.185 --> 27:23.485
Or the D.A.?
I know

27:23.487 --> 27:26.888
our investigations
should be separate,

27:26.890 --> 27:28.690
but this cop's career,

27:28.692 --> 27:32.745
his life depends on us
finding the truth.

27:34.247 --> 27:36.832
I'm not sure
that I can get there on my own.

27:50.913 --> 27:53.298
It's gonna be good.

28:00.523 --> 28:03.358
Wait exactly one minute.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.145
Yes, sir.

28:08.764 --> 28:11.933
Excuse me?

28:13.052 --> 28:15.053
Miss Dominga?

28:15.055 --> 28:16.989
Frank Reagan.

28:16.991 --> 28:20.459
I know who you are, and
I already talked to the cops.

28:20.461 --> 28:23.612
Mm. Saw you on TV.

28:25.131 --> 28:27.132
You were pretty angry.

28:27.134 --> 28:28.950
It shouldn't take a kid
getting shot

28:28.952 --> 28:31.170
for people to know
what goes on down here.

28:31.172 --> 28:33.422
I agree.

28:33.424 --> 28:36.358
I gather you're not a fan
of my police department?

28:37.678 --> 28:39.144
Well, maybe that's because

28:39.146 --> 28:41.647
we're tired of getting hassled
in this neighborhood.

28:41.649 --> 28:44.900
But when we need help,
you can't find a cop.

28:44.902 --> 28:46.401
This store got robbed

28:46.403 --> 28:47.903
two weeks ago.

28:47.905 --> 28:51.806
It took over three hours
for someone to show up.

28:52.692 --> 28:54.660
It's unacceptable.

28:54.662 --> 28:58.013
And I'll find out why,
you have my word.

29:00.250 --> 29:03.919
You didn't actually see
the shooting?

29:03.921 --> 29:06.538
I heard the gunshot,
I walked outside,

29:06.540 --> 29:10.592
I saw him laying on the sidewalk
with a bullet in his back...

29:12.178 --> 29:13.929
...dying.

29:13.931 --> 29:15.931
Excuse me, sir.

29:15.933 --> 29:17.382
Sorry.

29:30.731 --> 29:32.731
In your sworn statement,

29:32.733 --> 29:35.234
you said you never saw
a gun on the ground.

29:35.236 --> 29:37.286
No.

29:37.288 --> 29:40.572
And... there were
no other witnesses?

29:40.574 --> 29:44.042
I mean, I don't think so.
I don't know. No.

29:45.461 --> 29:49.164
I've been a cop
for a long time, Miss Dominga,

29:49.166 --> 29:53.201
and... when bullets
start flying around,

29:53.203 --> 29:56.338
things get very confusing.

29:56.340 --> 29:59.258
Now, if you saw a gun

29:59.260 --> 30:02.227
and picked it up
to prevent further violence

30:02.229 --> 30:05.063
and forget to mention that
to the investigators,

30:05.065 --> 30:07.482
that's understandable.

30:07.484 --> 30:09.851
But if you hid that gun

30:09.853 --> 30:12.938
to incriminate Officer Montero,

30:12.940 --> 30:15.741
that's called tampering
with physical evidence

30:15.743 --> 30:18.744
and hindering prosecution.

30:18.746 --> 30:20.946
Both felonies.

30:27.170 --> 30:29.171
So, I'm gonna

30:29.173 --> 30:31.373
ask you one more time.

30:34.294 --> 30:38.347
Did you see a gun on the ground
next to Marcus Green?

31:18.732 --> 31:19.866
I'm gonna squeeze Damiri

31:19.868 --> 31:22.118
to give up the Russians
who killed Kramer.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.454
Okay. Just make sure
my name doesn't come up, okay?

31:25.456 --> 31:27.540
You got it.

31:27.542 --> 31:29.575
You also got something
else to worry about.

31:29.577 --> 31:31.177
Story of my life.
What now?

31:31.179 --> 31:33.579
One of those high rollers
you turned me onto--

31:33.581 --> 31:35.131
I interviewed him.

31:35.133 --> 31:38.768
He told me it was his bookie
who turned him onto the game.

31:38.770 --> 31:40.219
Great.

31:40.221 --> 31:43.272
You can never trust a damn actor.
Right.

31:43.274 --> 31:46.192
You understand that this
makes you an accessory

31:46.194 --> 31:48.260
to Damiri's gambling
organization, right?

31:48.262 --> 31:50.279
Come on! You're...

31:50.281 --> 31:52.782
You're gonna jam me up for
pointing a guy toward a game?

31:52.784 --> 31:56.152
Look, I can put in a good
word with the D.A.'s office.

31:56.154 --> 31:58.204
In exchange for you
doing something for me.

31:58.206 --> 32:00.740
What?

32:00.742 --> 32:03.793
I can't bring down Damiri
without his black book.

32:05.045 --> 32:06.879
You're the one who's
gonna get it for me.

32:06.881 --> 32:09.949
How the hell am I supposed
to get my hands on that?

32:09.951 --> 32:12.218
Come on, Gary. You're a former
cop and a pretty damn good one.

32:12.220 --> 32:13.285
You could figure it out.

32:13.287 --> 32:15.555
You know I need
that book.

32:15.557 --> 32:18.140
Come on, I'm not asking
you to cure cancer here.

32:20.011 --> 32:21.310
All right?

32:21.312 --> 32:23.462
Okay.

32:23.464 --> 32:25.514
I will get you that damn book,

32:25.516 --> 32:28.300
but after that,
I am free and clear on this.

32:29.135 --> 32:31.320
All right.

32:31.322 --> 32:33.656
You got a deal.

32:33.658 --> 32:36.075
Danny?

32:37.694 --> 32:41.163
Thanks for giving me the chance
to get straight on this.

32:41.165 --> 32:42.915
I owe you one.

32:43.817 --> 32:46.686
No, you don't.

32:54.544 --> 32:56.596
Hey.

32:56.598 --> 32:58.714
Hey. You okay?

32:58.716 --> 33:00.266
Yeah. This case is
just turning out

33:00.268 --> 33:02.501
to be a bigger headache
than I could have imagined.

33:02.503 --> 33:03.686
What's going on with you?

33:03.688 --> 33:05.855
When I dumped
our victim's cell phone,

33:05.857 --> 33:07.556
a couple of numbers
came up private,

33:07.558 --> 33:10.276
so I got a subpoena
for the subscriber info.

33:10.278 --> 33:12.361
Turns out Kramer had
a 45-minute conversation

33:12.363 --> 33:13.679
with Arthur Phillips

33:13.681 --> 33:15.481
the day he died.

33:15.483 --> 33:16.515
Wait, his partner?

33:16.517 --> 33:17.783
The same Arthur Phillips

33:17.785 --> 33:19.035
that sat in this chair
and told us

33:19.037 --> 33:20.453
he hadn't heard
from Kramer in a week?

33:20.455 --> 33:21.954
Thought maybe
we should chat about it,

33:21.956 --> 33:24.023
so he's in Interrogation.

33:24.025 --> 33:26.325
Well, look at that.

33:26.327 --> 33:28.127
Let's go chat about it.

33:28.129 --> 33:29.361
So you knew
about the gambling?

33:29.363 --> 33:31.414
Teddy came clean
the morning he died.

33:31.416 --> 33:32.832
Said he owed Damiri

33:32.834 --> 33:34.250
close to $3 million.

33:34.252 --> 33:37.202
$3 million, and what,
Damiri taking over partnership

33:37.204 --> 33:39.755
in the firm was supposed
to wipe out Kramer's debt?

33:39.757 --> 33:41.424
Yeah.

33:41.426 --> 33:42.975
And you didn't think
to tell us this?

33:42.977 --> 33:44.844
When Teddy told me
what was really going on,

33:44.846 --> 33:47.563
I offered to get the partners
to change the vote,

33:47.565 --> 33:49.732
but Teddy refused.

33:49.734 --> 33:50.983
He said this guy

33:50.985 --> 33:52.318
was too dangerous.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.053
Looks like he was right.

33:54.055 --> 33:55.404
Did Damiri ever

33:55.406 --> 33:56.605
threaten Kramer?

33:56.607 --> 33:58.824
Damiri said his partners
were tired of sitting around,

33:58.826 --> 34:00.609
waiting for their money.
Uh-huh.

34:00.611 --> 34:03.195
They were going
to collect on his debt.

34:04.164 --> 34:06.782
In blood.

34:11.788 --> 34:14.090
Due to the potential
for public unrest,

34:14.092 --> 34:15.908
I have been given advance notice

34:15.909 --> 34:20.045
of the grand jury's decision
on the Marcus Green case.

34:20.047 --> 34:22.081
And?

34:22.083 --> 34:25.016
They are declining
to indict my officer.

34:26.853 --> 34:28.804
That neighborhood
won't accept that verdict.

34:28.806 --> 34:32.190
They will... once you do.

34:32.193 --> 34:34.143
Frank, I don't have
that kind of power.

34:34.145 --> 34:37.396
This decision is going to wreak
havoc no matter what I say.

34:37.398 --> 34:38.947
A hundred bucks says it won't

34:38.949 --> 34:40.783
so long as
their mayor

34:40.784 --> 34:43.536
gets out in front and
explains it to 'em.

34:43.538 --> 34:45.871
Unless of course you
think it's rigged, too.

34:45.873 --> 34:47.873
Then they'll see
right through you

34:47.875 --> 34:50.208
and then, yes...

34:50.210 --> 34:52.911
there will be rioting
in your streets.

34:52.914 --> 34:55.297
<i>Our</i> streets.
Those ones,

34:55.299 --> 34:58.283
those neighborhoods--
I can only police 'em.

34:58.285 --> 35:00.720
I do not have
their respect,

35:00.722 --> 35:03.455
much less their affection,
and that's that.

35:03.457 --> 35:07.093
Stand the hell up,
would you, Frank?

35:07.095 --> 35:08.794
Why?

35:08.796 --> 35:09.729
Because you never used

35:09.731 --> 35:11.263
to sit down
when you came in here.

35:11.265 --> 35:13.966
You always pace about
like some cop instinct told you

35:13.968 --> 35:16.268
that a moving target
was harder to hit.

35:21.908 --> 35:23.993
This better?

35:23.995 --> 35:26.946
Don't treat me any differently
because I'm in this wheelchair.

35:26.948 --> 35:28.247
I'm not.

35:28.249 --> 35:29.982
Then, where the hell were you
after the press conference?

35:29.984 --> 35:31.700
The old Frank Reagan would
have been up in my grill

35:31.702 --> 35:33.252
the moment we left
that stage.

35:33.254 --> 35:35.821
I thought about it.

35:35.823 --> 35:37.957
But I didn't hear
a peep out of you.

35:43.081 --> 35:44.346
Take the kid gloves off, Frank.

35:44.348 --> 35:45.314
You got shot

35:45.316 --> 35:49.635
and it put you
in that wheelchair...

35:49.637 --> 35:54.306
but not by an NYPD officer
doing his job.

35:54.308 --> 35:58.010
James Montero shot that boy
in self-defense.

35:58.012 --> 35:59.178
That's the verdict,

35:59.180 --> 36:02.531
and unless you have solid
information otherwise,

36:02.533 --> 36:05.451
it is your duty
to lead by example

36:05.453 --> 36:07.403
and fully and publicly accept

36:07.405 --> 36:10.873
that this particular tragedy...

36:10.875 --> 36:12.958
could not have been averted.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.960
No.

36:16.029 --> 36:18.380
You're the mayor
of that neighborhood

36:18.382 --> 36:20.332
and all the ones like it

36:20.334 --> 36:25.504
and not just by elected office
but by much more.

36:26.506 --> 36:30.059
By the respect and affection
you command

36:30.061 --> 36:33.212
from the people
who work and live in them.

36:36.683 --> 36:38.884
Use it or lose it.

36:39.686 --> 36:41.887
Sir.

36:43.190 --> 36:45.891
I'm gonna schedule
a town hall meeting...

36:45.893 --> 36:50.162
you and me... at
the Clinton Street Rec Center.

36:50.164 --> 36:53.916
I'll be there.

36:53.918 --> 36:57.402
Try not to smile when they boo
when I'm introduced.

36:59.072 --> 37:01.073
I will try.

37:01.075 --> 37:02.875
Try harder.

37:08.765 --> 37:11.016
Welcome back, Mr. Mayor.

37:20.777 --> 37:22.728
Officer Montero.

37:22.730 --> 37:24.196
I know you're
busy, Ms. Reagan,

37:24.198 --> 37:27.783
but I wanted
to thank you.

37:27.785 --> 37:30.152
I was just doing my job.

37:30.154 --> 37:32.238
It was more than that;
you were the only one

37:32.240 --> 37:34.490
willing to find out
what really happened.

37:34.492 --> 37:37.877
I'm just glad they're putting
you back to full duty.

37:37.879 --> 37:41.997
Actually I'm taking
a leave of absence.

37:42.883 --> 37:44.950
I need some time.

37:44.952 --> 37:47.219
I hope you're not thinking
of resigning.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.955
Marcus Green was
a troubled kid,

37:49.957 --> 37:51.924
but he was still
just a kid.

37:51.926 --> 37:54.343
You did what you had to do.

37:54.345 --> 37:57.313
Yeah.

37:57.315 --> 37:59.798
Now I need to find a
way to live with it.

38:04.521 --> 38:06.572
<i>You think Damiri's going</i>

38:06.574 --> 38:09.024
to give up his Russian friends
that killed Kramer?

38:09.026 --> 38:11.076
If he thinks it'll keep
his ass from rotting away

38:11.078 --> 38:12.912
and growing old in
a prison, he will.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.918
Teri Damiri.

38:20.453 --> 38:22.487
Let's check his office.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.492
Reagan.

38:38.521 --> 38:40.639
It's Damiri.

38:41.725 --> 38:44.059
They shot him in the head.

38:44.061 --> 38:46.278
I guess his Russian friends got
to him before we did.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.279
Yeah, I guess

38:47.281 --> 38:48.480
they didn't want him
naming names.

38:48.482 --> 38:49.481
He's cold.

38:49.483 --> 38:51.283
Danny.

39:19.562 --> 39:22.514
Damiri's black book.

39:23.350 --> 39:25.818
With the pages ripped out.

39:26.653 --> 39:28.854
Yeah.

39:31.057 --> 39:33.492
They cut his throat.

39:33.494 --> 39:34.610
It's what
the Russians do

39:34.612 --> 39:36.662
to snitches.
Which means

39:36.664 --> 39:39.164
the guys that did this are
halfway to Moscow by now.

39:39.166 --> 39:41.400
Yeah.

39:41.402 --> 39:45.170
Teri was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

39:47.540 --> 39:48.957
I'm gonna go call it in.

40:07.944 --> 40:09.945
I did a stupid
and reckless thing

40:09.947 --> 40:13.699
that could have put our
good name in jeopardy.

40:14.567 --> 40:17.119
I'm sorry.

40:17.121 --> 40:19.121
What are we talking about?

40:19.123 --> 40:20.739
Remember when I told you

40:20.741 --> 40:22.524
I went to Atlantic
City last year?

40:22.526 --> 40:24.960
Yeah.
I was actually in a hotel room

40:24.962 --> 40:27.413
on the Upper East Side.

40:28.548 --> 40:30.666
A high-stakes poker game.

40:30.668 --> 40:34.219
Played for 12
hours straight.

40:35.922 --> 40:37.923
Okay.

40:37.925 --> 40:39.391
It gets worse.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.793
I didn't know it at the time,

40:41.795 --> 40:42.961
but it turns out

40:42.963 --> 40:46.265
that the Russians
were involved in it, too.

40:46.267 --> 40:49.818
Danny was working a case
involving a gambling ring.

40:49.820 --> 40:51.270
There was a
black book,

40:51.272 --> 40:55.140
a sort of master list
of all the players' names.

40:56.776 --> 40:58.577
My name was in it.

40:58.579 --> 41:00.079
And Danny, being Danny,

41:00.081 --> 41:03.198
was trying to figure out
what to do about it.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.700
Yeah.

41:04.702 --> 41:07.419
Commissioner shouldn't know
any more about this.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.321
But the thing is...

41:09.323 --> 41:10.956
Pop.
I've been a poker player

41:10.958 --> 41:12.174
all my life.

41:12.176 --> 41:14.159
Always the
best guy

41:14.161 --> 41:15.644
at the table.

41:15.646 --> 41:17.463
But never at the best table.

41:19.183 --> 41:21.100
I just wanted to know
what it felt like

41:21.102 --> 41:25.604
to go up against real players
for real money.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.976
Must have been a hell of a game.

41:30.978 --> 41:33.979
Yeah, it was.

41:33.981 --> 41:36.732
Learned my lesson,
a damn expensive one.

41:36.734 --> 41:39.351
How much you lose?

41:39.353 --> 41:41.870
Expensive for them.

41:41.872 --> 41:43.655
Let's just say

41:43.657 --> 41:48.076

got a pretty healthy donation.
