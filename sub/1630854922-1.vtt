WEBVTT

00:30.857 --> 00:31.857
Yes.

00:34.517 --> 00:36.358
You want a receipt with that?

00:36.438 --> 00:37.874
No, thank you.
But thank you very much,

00:37.898 --> 00:39.358
and have a merry Christmas.

00:42.768 --> 00:43.768
Yes.

00:46.318 --> 00:47.728
Oh, alright.

00:49.858 --> 00:52.068
Oh, yes, got any coconut bars?

00:54.568 --> 00:56.358
Coconut bars.

00:58.438 --> 00:59.688
I got those.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.728
Let's see.

01:02.728 --> 01:03.818
And how about fruit?

01:03.898 --> 01:06.938
Apples, bananas, anything like that?

01:11.108 --> 01:12.608
Fruit snacks?

01:15.268 --> 01:17.188
Ten percent juice.

01:17.268 --> 01:20.518
I'll take three of those.

01:20.608 --> 01:22.768
Oh. Oh, yes.

01:25.938 --> 01:27.068
This is for adults,

01:27.148 --> 01:30.818
but I think kids will like 'em too, right?

01:32.318 --> 01:34.648
Yes, of course, they will.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.318
Everyone likes coloring books.

01:37.318 --> 01:38.938
They gotta like that.

01:47.019 --> 01:50.069
Alright, you two stay here.
I'm gonna find him.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.979
So cool.

01:57.769 --> 01:58.859
What?

01:58.939 --> 02:00.069
The planes.

02:00.149 --> 02:02.189
I can't believe we get to fly in one.

02:03.359 --> 02:04.939
Hey, you!

02:05.019 --> 02:07.569
Need a hand there, Santa?

02:07.649 --> 02:09.609
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Clause.

02:13.019 --> 02:14.729
Are the kids excited?

02:15.769 --> 02:19.229
Ben is. I wish I could fly out with you.

02:19.319 --> 02:20.439
Yeah, me too.

02:20.519 --> 02:23.439
But this will give you that quiet time

02:23.519 --> 02:25.189
to finish your presentation.

02:26.069 --> 02:27.149
True.

02:28.729 --> 02:31.569
Well, you'll have your hands full now.

02:32.859 --> 02:34.979
You know, I bet he'll bring junk food.

02:35.069 --> 02:37.439
For the plane and for the cabin.

02:37.519 --> 02:39.569
So that's why I have to go.

02:39.649 --> 02:42.899
To make sure you're checking
your blood sugar.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.739
Yeah, I've read every book
I could possibly read

02:45.819 --> 02:47.939
about parenting blended families.

02:48.019 --> 02:50.729
And I've boiled it down
to a four-point behavioral matrix.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.689
I've never seen a plan
that kids can't break all to pieces.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.440
Four days from now,

02:58.520 --> 03:00.570
when you catch up with me
and the kids at the cabin,

03:01.650 --> 03:03.570
they're gonna beg you to say yes.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.820
Even Sam?

03:04.900 --> 03:07.150
Specially Sam.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.190
Oh, and what about my dad?

03:10.190 --> 03:14.020
Oh, he'll regretfully admit
that I'll make a fine son-in-law.

03:15.230 --> 03:18.070
Oh, so you have a ring hidden here

03:18.150 --> 03:20.900
and an elaborate schedule
that tells you when we'll get engaged?

03:20.980 --> 03:24.820
Well, there is an ideal sequence
of events.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.480
Family dinner's
at 5:45 Christmas night and...

03:28.570 --> 03:33.980
I hope you can relax
and just get to know the kids.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.650
Maybe be a little spontaneous.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.940
Oh, spontaneity is on the matrix.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.520
You arrive Christmas Eve night,
open up gifts,

03:42.610 --> 03:46.730
and then maybe,
just maybe, there's a ring.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.650
Is that so?

03:48.730 --> 03:51.230
I hear your dad set up a tent
about a mile from the cabin

03:51.320 --> 03:53.020
to keep me away from his daughter.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.480
Yeah, he's such a sweet thing.

03:55.570 --> 03:58.020
I mean, I told him that I ran
a background check on you

03:58.110 --> 03:59.400
after our second date, but...

03:59.480 --> 04:00.570
Smart call.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.400
I'm gonna get the kids.

04:17.941 --> 04:19.271
Jason!

04:19.361 --> 04:20.521
Hey, buddy.

04:22.771 --> 04:24.231
You ready for an adventure?

04:24.321 --> 04:25.981
Mom said no adventures allowed.

04:26.071 --> 04:29.231
Oh, well, okay. You can call shotgun.

04:29.321 --> 04:30.321
Shotgun!

04:34.571 --> 04:36.611
It's small, isn't it?

04:36.691 --> 04:39.481
Well, the 747 is in the shop.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.231
Don't worry, she's perfectly safe.

04:42.271 --> 04:44.021
- Can I fly it?
- No.

04:44.111 --> 04:45.821
When you're 16, sure.

04:45.901 --> 04:47.361
Why can't we just drive up?

04:47.441 --> 04:49.231
Jason promised Ben a flight.

04:49.321 --> 04:50.651
There's nothing to worry about.

04:50.731 --> 04:52.611
This plane is perfectly safe.

04:52.691 --> 04:55.271
If something's safe,
you don't have to say it all the time.

04:57.321 --> 04:58.691
Where do I put this?

05:06.481 --> 05:08.021
You don't have to do this, you know.

05:08.861 --> 05:09.941
Go to grandpa's cabin.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.271
I wanna be with you guys for Christmas.

05:12.361 --> 05:14.571
There's no cell service,
not even a landline.

05:15.111 --> 05:17.982
- Well, I brought a book.
- We'll be living like animals.

05:18.072 --> 05:20.232
Well, I hear it has electricity
and running water.

05:20.322 --> 05:22.862
So do thunder clouds
but you wouldn't live in one.

05:24.362 --> 05:25.732
Thanks for the warning, kid.

05:26.232 --> 05:28.732
Mom just texted from last place
they get reception.

05:28.822 --> 05:31.072
They'll be at the cabin in an hour or so.

05:31.152 --> 05:33.652
Well, that's great.
We'll be right behind them.

05:33.732 --> 05:35.942
The weather's clear all the way
to the landing strip.

05:37.232 --> 05:39.522
Ben's glucometer. Sam will help.

05:39.612 --> 05:40.942
Alright, no problem.

05:46.772 --> 05:48.272
Let's pray before we go.

05:54.232 --> 05:56.572
Father god, we're flying closer to you.

05:56.652 --> 06:00.652
Just keep an eye on us
and keep us safe in your arms.

06:00.732 --> 06:02.362
- Amen.
- Amen.

06:07.322 --> 06:08.322
Ben.

06:31.233 --> 06:32.443
Bye, mom.

06:32.523 --> 06:35.403
You sure it's okay
to surprise your folks like this?

06:35.483 --> 06:38.823
The only thing my dad likes
better than surprises

06:38.903 --> 06:40.443
are terrible jokes.

06:40.523 --> 06:43.863
Besides, here's your chance
to win his approval.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.273
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.773
Alright, guys.
This is gonna be super fun.

06:58.363 --> 06:59.693
Three-hour flight.

06:59.773 --> 07:01.733
Plenty of time
to get to know each other.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.983
Alright, we ready?

07:05.073 --> 07:06.523
Aye-aye, captain.

07:07.273 --> 07:09.903
Co-pilot Ben, check out the list.

07:10.483 --> 07:12.323
- Altimeter?
- Set.

07:12.403 --> 07:14.323
- Directional gyro.
- Set.

07:14.403 --> 07:15.693
Instrumented radius?

07:15.773 --> 07:17.073
Checked and set.

07:17.153 --> 07:18.773
Seatbelt and shoulder harnesses?

07:19.653 --> 07:20.943
Fastened.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.823
You are clear for takeoff, captain.

07:23.863 --> 07:25.113
Passenger Sam.

07:25.823 --> 07:26.943
More like hostage.

08:12.114 --> 08:13.734
That's legacy peak there.

08:15.074 --> 08:16.904
We're more than halfway to the cabin.

08:18.694 --> 08:20.774
Sweet, what's that river?

08:21.574 --> 08:23.324
- That...
- I just saw a wolf.

08:23.404 --> 08:24.234
You did not.

08:24.324 --> 08:25.574
I did.

08:26.194 --> 08:27.654
Well, we're pretty high for that.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.444
Can we go closer to the mountain?

08:31.694 --> 08:33.864
Well, it's off the flight plan, Ben.

08:33.944 --> 08:35.364
It's never a good idea.

08:35.444 --> 08:37.774
Come on, what's the worst
that could happen?

08:37.864 --> 08:40.074
Please, Jason. Please.

08:40.734 --> 08:43.024
And besides, I thought I was co-pilot.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.194
Spontaneity. Okay, bud.

08:59.075 --> 09:03.115
The wolf was right about... there.

09:04.485 --> 09:05.485
That's a moose.

09:06.825 --> 09:09.155
There was a wolf. There was.

09:09.235 --> 09:12.075
We can get a little closer.
See what else is out there.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.735
Oh, there, it went into the woods.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.615
You're the only one
that ever sees it though.

09:27.575 --> 09:29.075
There are wolves in the area.

09:34.235 --> 09:36.025
Ben, look, there's a big flock of birds.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.275
- Jason, what's happening?
- Bird strike.

09:48.865 --> 09:52.075
Oil pressure's dropping.
We're overheating.

09:54.945 --> 09:56.195
I gotta put her down.

09:59.946 --> 10:01.156
Hand me the map.

10:03.946 --> 10:05.446
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

10:05.526 --> 10:07.736
November 3-27, Juliet kilo.

10:07.826 --> 10:10.026
We are attempting an emergency landing.

10:11.026 --> 10:14.616
We're ten miles west-north-west
of legacy peak.

10:14.696 --> 10:16.026
Heading two-niner-two.

10:20.026 --> 10:21.116
Radio is dead.

10:23.026 --> 10:24.826
There's a clearing here I can land in.

10:27.576 --> 10:28.946
Hold on, kids. Hold on.

11:02.526 --> 11:03.736
Thank you, Jesus.

11:05.826 --> 11:08.656
This is more or less what I expected
when I got on the plane.

11:09.326 --> 11:11.827
Ben? Ben, you alright?

11:15.027 --> 11:16.737
I think I scratched my wrist.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.367
No, no, no.

11:29.197 --> 11:30.327
What's wrong?

11:31.907 --> 11:34.487
Seems our radio wasn't bird proof.

11:34.577 --> 11:36.117
Well, can you fix it?

11:36.197 --> 11:37.487
I hope so.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.157
Come on.

11:50.447 --> 11:51.657
My phone's busted.

11:54.777 --> 11:56.697
Well, the air intake is clogged.

11:57.537 --> 12:01.117
- Right.
- It seems to be some sort of oil leak.

12:09.987 --> 12:13.987
Ben, I found the first aid kit.
Let me see your wrist.

12:14.077 --> 12:15.077
Okay.

12:16.157 --> 12:17.277
Oh, sorry.

12:18.027 --> 12:19.707
I should have told you where to find that.

12:21.488 --> 12:23.698
A good babysitter would have
checked for injuries.

12:24.738 --> 12:26.948
Don't worry. I'm red cross certified.

12:34.328 --> 12:36.408
Is it okay to fly
with a cracked windshield?

12:37.278 --> 12:39.408
Well, that'll be cold, but...

12:40.908 --> 12:43.118
- It's better than walkin'.
- This might hurt.

12:43.198 --> 12:44.804
Cabin's probably
a three-day hike from here.

12:44.828 --> 12:46.028
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:48.778 --> 12:50.238
Or maybe in here.

12:52.078 --> 12:54.538
Here. Wrap your wrist, okay?

12:56.658 --> 12:58.408
It doesn't have to work long,

12:59.158 --> 13:01.778
but just long enough.

13:02.908 --> 13:03.908
Perfect.

13:04.988 --> 13:06.988
- How do you put this on?
- Just wrap it.

13:16.198 --> 13:20.828
If everything's okay when I start it,
y'all load up. We'll be on our way.

13:20.908 --> 13:21.988
Okay.

13:28.658 --> 13:29.658
Told you.

13:30.779 --> 13:32.159
Well, that's not great.

13:38.079 --> 13:39.239
Can you fix it?

13:42.829 --> 13:45.119
If we were at the hangar, I could.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.539
What are we gonna do?

13:46.619 --> 13:48.539
Ben, where's your jacket?

13:49.279 --> 13:51.159
In mom's car. Why?

13:54.869 --> 13:56.279
We're never gonna get home.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.949
Alright, we need to talk.

14:03.029 --> 14:04.329
Family meeting.

14:04.409 --> 14:05.739
Ben, stop.

14:06.239 --> 14:07.239
What?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.659
That's what we call it at home.
Family meeting.

14:15.239 --> 14:17.949
Here's the deal.
So, we need to set up,

14:18.029 --> 14:20.329
so rescuers will be able to find us.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.989
Make a shelter, start a fire,
ration our food.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.079
That sort of thing.

14:24.989 --> 14:25.989
How long?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.279
Well, your grandparents,

14:28.369 --> 14:30.369
they weren't expecting us
to come this early.

14:30.449 --> 14:31.619
Best case scenario,

14:31.699 --> 14:33.219
they start looking for us in four days,

14:33.239 --> 14:34.619
and find us in six.

14:36.829 --> 14:38.829
So, they won't even know
to be looking for us.

14:39.369 --> 14:41.540
Look, I'm gonna get you two set up,

14:41.620 --> 14:43.660
hike to the ranger station for help.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.700
Hiking alone and fast,

14:45.780 --> 14:47.740
I'll be back in about a day and half.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.160
When I babysit the Thompson triplets,

14:51.240 --> 14:53.040
you can't leave them alone
in the living room.

14:54.030 --> 14:57.240
How about wild animals?
What if the fire goes out?

14:58.410 --> 14:59.690
What if there's a serial killer?

14:59.740 --> 15:02.870
Don't worry, Sam.
Serial killers are a city thing.

15:02.950 --> 15:04.410
Out here would be ax murderers.

15:04.490 --> 15:05.490
Quiet!

15:21.280 --> 15:24.160
Look, if we make a plan and stick to it,

15:24.740 --> 15:25.830
everything's gonna be fine.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.760
I'm telling you we can't be left
alone here and you're not listening.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.200
I am listening.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.580
But staying here together
is not the best plan.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.870
Sam, why don't you try
to find us some dry wood?

15:40.490 --> 15:42.700
Ben and I, we can sort supplies.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.240
I just said you're not listening

15:44.330 --> 15:45.720
and now you're sending me alone
to the woods?

15:45.740 --> 15:48.540
Fine. I'll go get the wood.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.541
And when I come back,
I'll sort the supplies.

15:52.331 --> 15:53.541
Great.

15:53.621 --> 15:55.621
- I mean, I can go get the...
- No!

16:14.491 --> 16:16.491
Flashlight. That's good.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.741
Maybe there's another airplane
in one of those presents.

16:22.331 --> 16:23.331
There's so many.

16:23.411 --> 16:25.701
Yeah. He's trying to buy us off.

16:26.741 --> 16:28.701
Well, it's working.

16:32.541 --> 16:33.541
Compass.

16:35.241 --> 16:36.241
Let me see that.

16:41.621 --> 16:43.621
- Knife.
- Cool.

16:46.781 --> 16:49.781
It's not even his.
It's some guy named Matt.

16:49.871 --> 16:53.031
And maybe his birthday, 3-17.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.991
17? Let me look.

16:59.871 --> 17:01.121
Beloved.

17:02.242 --> 17:04.122
It's a Bible verse, genius.

17:04.202 --> 17:05.542
It must be from his dad.

17:08.122 --> 17:09.492
You can't take that, that's his.

17:10.452 --> 17:11.492
Mine now.

17:12.992 --> 17:15.332
What if he was gonna give it to me
as a Christmas present?

17:15.412 --> 17:17.872
- Yeah, okay.
- Ooh, and I can make a spear out of it.

17:26.952 --> 17:29.412
Ben, you put that back!
You can't read that.

17:29.492 --> 17:31.662
- That's private.
- Oh, come on, Sam.

17:31.742 --> 17:34.242
What if there's a list
of what our presents are?

17:35.332 --> 17:37.782
It's like a list for everything in here.

17:40.162 --> 17:43.452
Plane checklist, Christmas schedule,

17:43.542 --> 17:45.332
how to color-coordinate socks.

17:46.662 --> 17:49.082
Things to do, things to remember.

17:49.162 --> 17:51.662
That's weird.
Oh, here's one about us.

17:51.742 --> 17:53.662
Plan for Ben and Sam.

17:53.742 --> 17:54.742
What does it say?

17:55.332 --> 17:56.332
Let's see.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.542
Gain trust through time together.

17:59.622 --> 18:02.122
Buy them gifts to show affection.

18:02.202 --> 18:04.082
Get them to want the engagement.

18:04.832 --> 18:06.452
- Wait.
- Hey!

18:51.203 --> 18:52.243
What's this?

18:58.993 --> 18:59.993
Give me that.

19:01.543 --> 19:03.543
Are you and mom getting married?

19:03.623 --> 19:04.953
No. I mean...

19:06.453 --> 19:08.123
Yes. That's the plan.

19:09.953 --> 19:14.293
You're asking her on Christmas.
In four days?

19:15.543 --> 19:16.873
Did you read my notebook?

19:16.953 --> 19:19.163
You have to get us to like you first.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.293
I mean, Ben already likes me.

19:22.123 --> 19:23.124
True.

19:26.874 --> 19:31.784
So, all of this trip, the nice guy act,
the getting to know us,

19:31.874 --> 19:33.664
that's all part of your checklist?

19:33.744 --> 19:34.744
It's not like that.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.544
Is 'connect with the kids'
on your checklist or not?

19:38.124 --> 19:40.204
Sam, give me the ring.

19:42.244 --> 19:46.294
No. You're not ready for this.

19:48.034 --> 19:50.834
Please. It was my mom's ring.

19:54.084 --> 19:55.834
How did you get it back from Jessica?

19:58.994 --> 19:59.874
Who's Jessica?

19:59.954 --> 20:01.294
- No one.
- His fiancée.

20:01.374 --> 20:04.414
- What?
- Former fiancée.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.044
We broke it off years ago.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.334
Mom told me all about it.

20:10.084 --> 20:13.164
He broke it off the day of the wedding.

20:13.244 --> 20:14.744
That is so not cool.

20:15.454 --> 20:17.084
It's the other way around actually.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.084
She broke it off with me.

20:19.164 --> 20:20.164
Why?

20:23.164 --> 20:26.044
- It's complicated.
- Because kids were not part of your plan.

20:28.164 --> 20:29.244
Right?

20:29.334 --> 20:31.704
Sort of. I mean, that was part of it.

20:31.784 --> 20:34.245
Ben! Wait!

20:38.665 --> 20:39.665
Just...

20:49.785 --> 20:51.335
I'm gonna hold on to this.

20:52.745 --> 20:55.335
You can have it when you get back
from the ranger station.

20:56.415 --> 20:58.875
That way you actually have a reason

20:58.955 --> 21:00.375
to come back for us.

21:43.785 --> 21:44.786
Father,

21:46.546 --> 21:47.666
I need your help.

21:50.336 --> 21:53.086
I tried to plan the perfect trip.

21:55.246 --> 21:58.786
And I wanted to give these kids
something I never had.

22:02.086 --> 22:04.296
Seemed like everything
was coming together.

22:06.206 --> 22:07.246
But instead...

22:26.786 --> 22:28.336
Sam, I'm doing my best here.

22:29.996 --> 22:32.206
You're not even reaching
competent babysitter levels.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.166
Let alone replacement dad.

22:38.126 --> 22:40.836
Nothing is going to get you to that level.

22:42.456 --> 22:44.416
Well, I'm not trying to replace anyone.

22:49.956 --> 22:51.246
I understand how you feel.

22:51.336 --> 22:52.996
You have no idea how I feel.

22:56.337 --> 22:59.957
I was 12 when mom opened that door

23:00.047 --> 23:01.707
to two strangers in uniform.

23:05.047 --> 23:06.667
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

23:08.627 --> 23:09.997
Or tell him I love him.

23:13.207 --> 23:16.547
Or say thanks for being
a really great dad.

23:18.587 --> 23:19.587
And now...

23:24.457 --> 23:25.457
And now,

23:27.497 --> 23:28.997
I have to look after mom.

23:30.167 --> 23:31.917
And I gotta take care of Ben.

23:33.417 --> 23:37.417
Make sure no one ever hurts them again.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.667
What about you?

23:44.957 --> 23:46.587
Who takes care of you, Sam?

23:51.627 --> 23:52.627
I do.

23:55.377 --> 23:56.377
Me.

24:24.668 --> 24:26.298
Rise and shine, campers.

24:32.628 --> 24:35.588
Alright, kids.
I've been doing some thinking.

24:35.668 --> 24:38.168
If we stay here, it could be weeks

24:38.248 --> 24:39.878
till someone finds us.

24:39.958 --> 24:41.208
It's just way too long.

24:43.048 --> 24:44.628
So, you're leaving us?

24:44.708 --> 24:45.708
No.

24:46.378 --> 24:50.338
Actually, you were right, Sam.
We'll go together.

24:52.588 --> 24:53.878
Is there coffee?

24:56.248 --> 24:58.588
At the ranger station? Yeah.

24:58.668 --> 25:00.668
There's a three-day-old pot
of coffee so strong,

25:00.748 --> 25:02.498
it'll pick you up and carry you home.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.548
What's that for?

25:07.298 --> 25:09.248
In case someone does find the plane,

25:09.338 --> 25:10.798
they'll know where we went.

25:10.878 --> 25:11.878
Come here.

25:15.298 --> 25:16.299
Okay.

25:17.249 --> 25:21.249
So, we're heading down
the mountain a bit today

25:21.339 --> 25:25.999
then we'll trek through
the forest here. Alright?

25:26.089 --> 25:29.299
And tonight, we'll make it to legacy lake.

25:29.379 --> 25:31.299
Alright, we'll camp there
and follow the river

25:31.379 --> 25:32.839
to the ranger station.

25:32.919 --> 25:34.299
Be there by tomorrow afternoon.

25:36.169 --> 25:39.339
This thing is ancient. 1990?

25:39.999 --> 25:42.249
Did people even know how to make maps?

25:43.459 --> 25:46.959
Alright, that's the ranger station, right?

25:47.049 --> 25:49.669
And that's the cabin right here,
more or less.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.549
And we're right about here, I think.

25:53.669 --> 25:57.089
Which means what, Ben? Which way?

25:59.799 --> 26:01.049
This way.

26:01.129 --> 26:02.589
That's right.

26:02.669 --> 26:04.999
So, it's just one more night
in the wilderness.

26:05.089 --> 26:06.589
Yeah, that's not so bad.

26:06.669 --> 26:09.799
We'll take an early break tonight,
fish at the lake,

26:09.879 --> 26:12.419
- and then build a lean-to shelter.
- Sweet.

26:12.499 --> 26:15.249
But first, it's time for presents.

26:16.459 --> 26:17.549
- Come.
- No way.

26:18.959 --> 26:21.209
Yes! Oh, yes!

26:23.049 --> 26:24.589
Here, open this.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.130
A sled? No way.

26:32.210 --> 26:33.340
Yeah.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.210
Your mom said there's a sledding hill

26:35.300 --> 26:36.300
near the cabin.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.960
Plus, we can tote our supplies in it.

26:39.050 --> 26:40.050
More.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.800
Say thank you.

26:42.460 --> 26:43.630
Thanks. More.

26:43.710 --> 26:45.670
Well, let your sister open hers.

26:46.460 --> 26:49.420
Your mom said that you like to go fishing.

26:54.210 --> 26:57.090
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Oh, yeah. She loves to fish.

26:57.170 --> 26:58.880
She went all the time with our dad.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.210
She didn't mention that.

27:09.130 --> 27:12.380
And these were supposed to be
for Christmas night.

27:12.460 --> 27:14.170
I got one for your mom too.

27:26.130 --> 27:28.920
A jacket! And I actually need one.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.341
Team wild?

27:37.631 --> 27:39.251
It's his last name, duh.

27:40.591 --> 27:42.251
I love it. Thank you.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.591
I think the one I have on
is probably warmer.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.591
- For the hike.
- Yeah.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.801
Yeah, sure.

27:58.551 --> 27:59.631
Of course.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.711
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

28:32.341 --> 28:34.527
How is there a pathway out here
in the middle of nowhere?

28:34.551 --> 28:37.091
It's a game trail.
Lots of wildlife come through here.

28:37.171 --> 28:38.751
Like an animal highway?

28:38.841 --> 28:40.091
Exactly.

28:40.171 --> 28:42.211
Like, look at this for instance.

28:43.841 --> 28:44.961
Is that a hoof print?

28:45.051 --> 28:46.051
Deer.

28:50.592 --> 28:51.802
What about this one?

28:55.842 --> 28:58.342
Well, that's a dog, I think.

28:58.422 --> 28:59.462
You mean a wolf.

28:59.552 --> 29:01.552
No way a dog would be this far out.

29:02.132 --> 29:03.502
Grandpa's dog wanders all over.

29:03.592 --> 29:06.132
Never goes where he's supposed to.
That's why he's named Jonah.

29:06.672 --> 29:09.462
Dog and wolf prints are
basically the same.

29:09.552 --> 29:11.502
Well, even if we come across
a pack of wolves,

29:11.592 --> 29:12.902
they're not gonna be interested in us.

29:12.922 --> 29:15.132
They like nice big elk.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.302
Not two scrawny kids

29:16.382 --> 29:19.342
and an extremely muscular young man
like myself.

29:26.212 --> 29:29.342
Besides, we'll be at the ranger station
this time tomorrow. Come on.

29:54.172 --> 29:55.462
Hey, I got something for you.

29:55.552 --> 29:56.552
What?

29:59.463 --> 30:00.463
Annoying.

30:06.963 --> 30:08.463
Guys, come here.

30:16.753 --> 30:18.673
- My gosh.
- Hold on.

30:21.883 --> 30:23.133
Can you believe that?

30:23.213 --> 30:26.093
The bigger one, the Doe,
that's the momma.

30:26.923 --> 30:28.753
The two little ones,
one of them is a girl,

30:28.843 --> 30:32.213
and the one with little nubs
on his head, that's the boy.

30:35.963 --> 30:37.633
Should we eat them?

30:37.713 --> 30:38.713
Dude!

30:40.093 --> 30:42.633
We won't need venison
in the next few hours.

30:43.303 --> 30:44.593
So, where's the buck?

30:46.843 --> 30:48.673
The bucks don't stay with the fawns.

30:49.343 --> 30:50.553
No dad?

30:52.383 --> 30:53.633
That's sad.

30:54.423 --> 30:55.503
They'll be fine, Ben.

30:57.803 --> 30:59.343
Doe knows how to keep 'em safe.

31:00.383 --> 31:01.383
Absolutely.

31:02.713 --> 31:04.503
She knows exactly what to do.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.094
There she is.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.174
It's pretty.

31:27.254 --> 31:29.344
Sam, we'll get you a hole in the ice,

31:29.424 --> 31:30.924
so you can catch us a fish.

31:31.004 --> 31:33.054
Ben, you and I will set up a shelter.

31:33.134 --> 31:34.134
Alright.

31:37.054 --> 31:40.384
I can handle camp.
You guys go get the fish.

31:42.054 --> 31:43.054
Sure.

31:43.754 --> 31:44.754
No problem.

32:01.554 --> 32:02.754
This looks like a good spot.

32:02.844 --> 32:03.844
Yeah.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.884
Don't tell your mom
we went out on an adventure.

32:20.555 --> 32:23.055
This was...

32:24.715 --> 32:25.925
Ambitious.

32:26.005 --> 32:27.215
I'll go for a while.

32:29.805 --> 32:30.805
Okay.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.425
No way! Look.

32:40.805 --> 32:42.095
Nice.

32:48.555 --> 32:49.555
Nice.

33:02.215 --> 33:03.215
Thanks for helpin'.

33:04.005 --> 33:05.005
No problem.

33:06.595 --> 33:08.175
Hey, guys, what's up?

33:08.255 --> 33:10.595
Who's with the fishing pole?

33:10.675 --> 33:11.805
I don't know. I got bored.

33:20.505 --> 33:21.505
No.

33:22.715 --> 33:23.715
I got it.

33:24.635 --> 33:27.595
Nice. Nice.

33:28.425 --> 33:30.426
Sam, come quick. I caught a fish!

33:31.466 --> 33:32.716
Keep your line tight.

33:33.846 --> 33:34.846
Come on.

33:36.006 --> 33:37.256
Keep your line tight.

33:38.846 --> 33:41.676
- Look, there he is.
- I see it.

33:44.426 --> 33:45.556
It's beautiful.

33:47.966 --> 33:49.006
Way to go, Ben.

33:49.596 --> 33:51.216
Alright, let's take him back to camp.

33:58.346 --> 34:00.006
It even has beds.

34:01.716 --> 34:03.506
Hopefully, it'll keep us warm.

34:03.596 --> 34:05.676
I love this. Let's live here.

34:10.136 --> 34:13.216
Actually, I'm hungry.
Let's clean that fish.

34:15.676 --> 34:18.596
- Ben, give me the knife that you found.
- Okay.

34:18.676 --> 34:20.216
Knife? What knife?

34:20.846 --> 34:21.846
This knife.

34:22.386 --> 34:23.756
Where did you get that?

34:26.506 --> 34:28.216
Where did you get this knife?

34:29.806 --> 34:31.056
In the plane.

34:31.846 --> 34:33.346
I mean, where else?

34:36.556 --> 34:39.096
Look, you guys can't just take
other people's stuff.

34:39.807 --> 34:40.807
Alright?

34:41.847 --> 34:42.887
You can't!

34:45.217 --> 34:46.347
Bunch of kids.

34:49.637 --> 34:51.007
That was unexpected.

35:04.807 --> 35:05.847
Come on, Jason.

35:41.507 --> 35:42.557
That knife,

35:44.097 --> 35:46.597
it was a gift when I was growing up.

35:48.717 --> 35:51.468
It's just... it's one of the only things

35:51.558 --> 35:52.968
I have from that time.

35:54.558 --> 35:57.008
My mom's ring and that knife.

36:06.178 --> 36:09.098
So, what is this anyway?

36:13.558 --> 36:14.758
'What's this, ' she says.

36:16.558 --> 36:19.928
You kids have been deprived.
Deprived, I say.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.508
It's like a pan or something.

36:27.138 --> 36:28.388
Hey, what's the deal?

36:29.178 --> 36:31.638
Buying chocolate bars
with almonds in them?

36:31.718 --> 36:33.238
Well, I didn't know
what you guys would like.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.928
So, I just bought one of everything.

36:36.008 --> 36:38.678
You bought five of everything.

36:40.678 --> 36:41.758
What about fruits?

36:42.598 --> 36:44.138
Or is it just candy and beef jerky?

36:48.968 --> 36:49.968
Fruit snacks?

36:50.678 --> 36:52.058
It's ten percent juice.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.388
Corn syrup is not a fruit.

36:58.428 --> 36:59.508
What's even happening?

37:01.349 --> 37:02.889
It's popcorn.

37:04.679 --> 37:07.059
Popcorn with no microwave?

37:07.889 --> 37:10.219
This is the best vacation ever.

37:10.309 --> 37:11.349
Seriously.

37:24.639 --> 37:26.389
You wanna know something funny?

37:26.469 --> 37:27.469
What?

37:28.809 --> 37:31.099
I was so worried about
what to bring this week,

37:32.889 --> 37:37.679
that I bought coloring books.
Crayons. Mr. Prepared.

37:38.679 --> 37:40.139
Shut up. For Ben?

37:40.219 --> 37:43.469
Ben, you, me.

37:43.559 --> 37:45.429
I grabbed everything that was close.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.009
I don't believe you.

37:48.719 --> 37:50.219
Hand them over right now.

37:52.059 --> 37:54.309
Oh, no cellphone changes a woman.

37:57.889 --> 38:00.969
Hey, you guys wanna see something cool
my youth pastor taught me?

38:01.059 --> 38:02.059
Sure.

38:02.719 --> 38:06.259
Sam, hand me your least favorite crayon.

38:07.889 --> 38:08.889
Here you go.

38:10.469 --> 38:11.560
Good choice.

38:15.220 --> 38:16.350
Just like that.

38:17.930 --> 38:19.100
Here we go.

38:20.430 --> 38:21.970
Heat it up a little bit.

38:24.390 --> 38:26.140
Right in the wax.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.930
Oh, you're waterproofing the matches.

38:28.010 --> 38:29.850
That's exactly right.

38:29.930 --> 38:30.970
I told my youth pastor,

38:31.060 --> 38:33.220
I said, 'why didn't you
just buy waterproof?'

38:33.310 --> 38:36.010
he said, 'why buy
when you can just make 'em?'

38:41.180 --> 38:42.600
Okay, that was definitely a wolf.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.510
Don't worry.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.640
They won't come close to the fire.

38:57.810 --> 39:00.810
I wanna tell you the story
about how I got my knife.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.510
You know, my mom died
when I was young, right?

39:06.220 --> 39:08.600
So, your mom gave you the knife?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.350
- No.
- Let him tell the story.

39:12.640 --> 39:16.640
When my dad left,
they sent me to a foster home.

39:17.260 --> 39:20.350
So, your foster family gave you the knife?

39:22.011 --> 39:23.431
No, I...

39:24.971 --> 39:28.141
Well, I didn't stay there long.
Maybe three weeks.

39:30.061 --> 39:31.511
I wasn't an easy kid.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.971
I would wake up, screaming a lot at night.

39:37.141 --> 39:38.391
Well, I acted out.

39:39.761 --> 39:42.471
And they didn't know what to do with me.

39:43.471 --> 39:45.011
They was good people.

39:46.261 --> 39:48.431
How many foster homes
did you go through?

39:50.181 --> 39:52.561
I don't know. Maybe 20.

39:54.061 --> 39:56.181
Wait, is this still about the knife?

39:56.261 --> 39:57.431
Ben!

39:58.601 --> 40:00.391
So, when I was 17,

40:00.471 --> 40:03.561
this lady took me in
and she took me to her church.

40:04.931 --> 40:06.851
Youth pastor heard my story.

40:09.761 --> 40:13.011
I told him I didn't have a dad.
Not really.

40:14.811 --> 40:17.141
Two weeks later, he gave me that knife.

40:19.431 --> 40:24.101
Read me Bible verses
of how god takes care of orphans.

40:33.602 --> 40:34.762
And that verse,

40:36.472 --> 40:40.642
'this is my beloved son
whom I am well pleased.'

40:43.262 --> 40:44.642
youth pastor said...

40:46.522 --> 40:48.972
God has been watching out
for me the whole time.

40:50.932 --> 40:52.262
And he is my father

40:53.602 --> 40:55.562
even when there's no one else.

40:57.892 --> 41:00.972
It was the first time
I really felt like I had a dad.

41:03.932 --> 41:05.392
For a little bit anyway.

41:08.182 --> 41:09.682
Sorry I took your knife.

41:11.352 --> 41:14.522
No, it's okay. You didn't know.

41:19.562 --> 41:21.142
Sorry I yelled at you.

42:56.764 --> 42:58.264
We're almost there, guys.

43:08.474 --> 43:10.224
- There it is, guys.
- We're here.

43:10.314 --> 43:11.564
The ranger station.

43:16.354 --> 43:18.224
Shouldn't there be some signs of life?

43:19.394 --> 43:22.474
Like, smoke, cars, people?

43:59.314 --> 44:00.434
I can't believe it.

44:07.525 --> 44:08.565
Hey, Jason.

44:10.935 --> 44:12.275
Hold on, just give me a minute.

44:40.015 --> 44:42.605
Alright, we'll split up.
Look for anything useful.

44:43.475 --> 44:47.225
Maps, food, radios, anything.

45:19.436 --> 45:22.526
Can of chili and a can of pineapples.

45:23.226 --> 45:24.226
I found this.

45:26.396 --> 45:28.356
Sam, anything useful?

45:29.856 --> 45:33.106
This letter. Shuttered for budget cuts.

45:36.016 --> 45:38.936
Oh, yeah. And these.

45:44.186 --> 45:47.396
It's another two-day hike from here
to your grandparents' cabin.

45:47.476 --> 45:51.016
That's if we push hard,
but with this key...

46:18.476 --> 46:23.226
Oh, Sam! Yes! This is amazing. You did it.

46:24.146 --> 46:25.977
Oh, man.

46:26.067 --> 46:27.817
It looks like an antique.

46:27.897 --> 46:29.227
Oh, Benjamin,

46:29.317 --> 46:32.147
we old folks like to refer
to this as vintage.

46:33.277 --> 46:34.277
Hop off.

46:40.607 --> 46:41.977
What are you doing?

46:44.607 --> 46:45.937
No gas.

46:46.017 --> 46:49.317
Benjamin, hand me one of them gas cans.

46:49.397 --> 46:52.437
Sam, can you grab that funnel?

47:01.277 --> 47:04.107
- What are you doing?
- Gotta give it some gas.

47:04.187 --> 47:06.647
Old fuel oxidizes.

47:07.897 --> 47:09.067
It gets gummy.

47:09.147 --> 47:12.067
So, if we pour it through this cloth,

47:12.147 --> 47:13.727
it can filter some of it out.

47:13.817 --> 47:14.817
Cool.

47:17.107 --> 47:20.107
Oh. Come on, baby. Yes, yes.

47:20.977 --> 47:21.977
Beautiful.

47:24.767 --> 47:25.767
That's it.

47:27.687 --> 47:28.687
Try the keys.

47:30.527 --> 47:32.527
Keys, check.

47:32.607 --> 47:33.977
Start it! Start it!

47:35.938 --> 47:38.818
This old pup, it's a kickstart.

47:43.068 --> 47:44.478
So, it doesn't work?

47:44.568 --> 47:45.688
Hold on.

47:54.068 --> 47:55.068
What?

47:55.688 --> 47:57.358
The carburetor's fouled.

47:57.438 --> 47:59.158
I can have this thing
cleaned up and running

47:59.188 --> 48:00.478
in a couple of hours.

48:00.568 --> 48:01.818
- Hours?
- Yeah.

48:01.898 --> 48:02.728
Are you serious?

48:02.818 --> 48:07.358
- We can be headed to the cabin by mornin'.
- Oh, my god. Yes.

48:30.318 --> 48:33.108
See that? Carburetor's clean.

48:34.068 --> 48:37.728
Now we just put it back together
in the order we took it apart.

48:50.229 --> 48:52.439
Hey, how come you have all those lists?

48:52.529 --> 48:53.899
Like, all the time?

48:56.319 --> 48:58.069
That lady I was telling you about,

48:58.149 --> 48:59.439
my last foster mom,

49:00.149 --> 49:02.229
she taught me I was striking out at people

49:03.029 --> 49:04.569
'cause I was too overwhelmed.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.029
So,

49:06.729 --> 49:08.319
she said if I made a list,

49:09.439 --> 49:12.319
those big things broken down
into small pieces,

49:14.359 --> 49:16.569
it would help, you know?

49:17.689 --> 49:20.439
Like, which pieces go where.

49:20.529 --> 49:21.529
All that.

49:22.029 --> 49:25.279
Yeah, but like how come
me and Sam are in your notebook?

49:25.359 --> 49:28.939
Are we just pieces to you?

49:34.069 --> 49:37.109
No. Not at all. It's just...

49:41.899 --> 49:45.609
Well, I don't... I don't know
what to do with you and Sam.

49:45.689 --> 49:46.689
That's all.

49:48.479 --> 49:52.359
But I don't want to be a part
of an engine, you know?

49:53.149 --> 49:54.149
It doesn't feel right.

49:56.320 --> 49:59.280
Ben! Dinner's ready.

50:09.070 --> 50:10.470
Why don't you get something to eat?

50:11.320 --> 50:12.530
I'll finish this up.

50:25.900 --> 50:27.070
What's for dinner?

50:29.110 --> 50:31.280
Lukewarm chili and cold pineapples.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.480
My favorite.

50:42.190 --> 50:43.190
Sam!

50:59.110 --> 51:00.320
Jason, wolf!

51:04.320 --> 51:05.320
Hey!

51:13.651 --> 51:15.231
Y'all stay inside!

51:25.031 --> 51:26.151
Come on.

51:29.771 --> 51:32.361
The wolf can't get in, right? Right?

51:35.771 --> 51:38.481
- What are we gonna do?
- Check if the wolf is still there.

51:43.031 --> 51:44.511
The wolf just went around the corner.

51:48.231 --> 51:50.031
Jason, we're gonna run across!

51:50.651 --> 51:53.191
No, wait. The atv is almost done.

51:54.321 --> 51:56.071
The station's on fire!

51:57.151 --> 51:59.611
What? No, no, no, no.

52:00.481 --> 52:01.481
Get behind me.

52:04.981 --> 52:05.981
Come on.

52:22.152 --> 52:24.362
Get on! Get on! Back up!

52:25.192 --> 52:26.232
Ben, on it.

52:26.322 --> 52:29.362
Back up! Get back! Get back! Get back!

52:29.442 --> 52:33.152
- Ben, no.
- We gotta go. Come on, Jason.

52:41.732 --> 52:42.782
Watch and learn.

52:44.362 --> 52:46.822
Ben, please. You don't even know
how to drive this thing.

52:48.652 --> 52:51.072
Alright, Ben, look.
Watch out for those rocks.

52:51.152 --> 52:52.152
Fine.

52:58.322 --> 52:59.612
I think we lost him.

53:09.402 --> 53:12.822
Hey, Ben! Ben, you gotta slow down,
alright? Pump the brake.

53:12.902 --> 53:15.192
- I don't know what that means.
- Just be careful.

53:15.692 --> 53:17.282
Keep your eyes on the road, alright?

53:17.362 --> 53:18.652
This is so cool.

53:18.732 --> 53:21.232
Mom would have never let me keep driving.

53:21.322 --> 53:24.032
Yeah, because she's
an actual responsible parent.

53:24.482 --> 53:26.482
You're not in charge of me, Sam.

53:27.483 --> 53:30.283
- I can reach the brake too, genius.
- Sam, wait!

53:40.153 --> 53:41.233
Sam!

53:49.863 --> 53:51.033
Sam!

54:16.823 --> 54:17.823
Sam!

54:25.653 --> 54:26.653
Come on.

54:27.193 --> 54:28.193
Sam!

54:29.033 --> 54:30.483
We need some dry branches.

54:30.573 --> 54:33.283
Get some twigs, pine needles, whatever.

54:42.904 --> 54:44.234
We gotta get you warm.

54:44.324 --> 54:45.574
I got sticks.

54:51.784 --> 54:52.784
Right here.

54:57.364 --> 54:58.364
They're wet.

54:59.364 --> 55:00.574
The waterproof ones.

55:02.114 --> 55:03.114
What?

55:03.614 --> 55:04.864
The crayon matches.

55:05.984 --> 55:07.284
Oh, yes.

55:11.324 --> 55:12.364
Come on. Come on.

55:25.734 --> 55:26.734
Yes!

55:30.694 --> 55:31.904
I need your phone.

55:32.904 --> 55:35.024
- There's no cell reception.
- Give me your phone now!

55:40.234 --> 55:41.694
Wait, wait!

55:47.114 --> 55:48.114
Gloves.

55:49.865 --> 55:51.365
Give me the matches.

55:51.445 --> 55:52.825
- What?
- The matches.

55:55.405 --> 55:57.405
First, dry the matches in your hair.

55:59.195 --> 56:01.945
I saw it on tiktok.
It will work. It has to.

56:10.535 --> 56:12.945
You did it. Yes!

56:14.785 --> 56:15.905
And you keep it going.

56:15.985 --> 56:17.445
- Alright.
- I'll get more branches.

56:57.035 --> 56:59.736
Ben, you okay?

57:01.236 --> 57:02.236
Yeah.

57:10.736 --> 57:11.906
You think Sam's okay?

57:11.986 --> 57:15.406
She's sleepin'. She's keepin' warm.

57:16.446 --> 57:17.446
Good.

57:19.286 --> 57:20.616
I know this is a big deal,

57:20.696 --> 57:23.196
but do you think
I can borrow your knife?

57:24.036 --> 57:25.536
I wanted to make a spear.

57:26.576 --> 57:31.736
Ben, there's a lot of responsibility
when it comes to having a knife.

57:32.786 --> 57:34.736
I was the one
who started the fire for Sam.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.326
I know, pal. And that was great.

57:40.366 --> 57:44.236
But I'm feeling a little nervous
about giving you a knife

57:44.326 --> 57:45.646
before I know you can be careful.

57:45.696 --> 57:47.786
Doesn't your dumb checklist
say something about

57:47.866 --> 57:49.866
how to learn to trust each other?

57:52.866 --> 57:55.536
Look, I'm exhausted

57:56.236 --> 57:58.196
and we're gonna need
to find food come morning.

57:59.696 --> 58:01.696
So how about we start
with something small?

58:02.656 --> 58:05.656
Can I trust you to keep watch for an hour?

58:06.366 --> 58:07.486
Of course, you can.

59:05.157 --> 59:07.697
Jason. Jason.

59:09.447 --> 59:10.787
Give me a minute.

59:10.867 --> 59:13.037
I'm going a little ways down the river.

59:13.117 --> 59:14.947
Try and see if I can find food for Sam.

59:15.947 --> 59:16.987
I won't go far.

59:17.867 --> 59:18.867
Okay.

59:20.988 --> 59:22.448
It's my knife, Ben.

59:22.538 --> 59:24.288
You can't drive the atv, Ben.

59:25.238 --> 59:27.488
Ben, don't smash my phone with a rock.

59:28.038 --> 59:31.328
When I come back with the food,
I better hear a thank you, Ben.

59:31.408 --> 59:33.038
Hey, Ben,
maybe you should be in charge

59:33.118 --> 59:34.738
for the rest of the way to the cabin.

59:56.448 --> 59:57.448
Tracks.

1:00:02.618 --> 1:00:03.698
Did you hear that?

1:00:07.198 --> 1:00:08.538
Where's Ben?

1:00:11.198 --> 1:00:12.198
Ben?

1:00:14.368 --> 1:00:16.578
Ben? Ben?

1:00:18.488 --> 1:00:19.578
Flashlight's gone.

1:00:23.908 --> 1:00:24.908
Ben!

1:00:29.618 --> 1:00:31.369
- Get your jacket on.
- Okay.

1:00:32.239 --> 1:00:33.579
- Let's go find him.
- Alright.

1:00:47.619 --> 1:00:48.739
Yes.

1:01:23.369 --> 1:01:24.989
So, camp was...

1:01:31.489 --> 1:01:32.489
This way.

1:01:35.159 --> 1:01:36.159
Ben!

1:01:37.789 --> 1:01:39.449
Jason, tracks.

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:47.370
He couldn't have gone far.

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:50.620
I mean, how long was I asleep?
An hour? Maybe two?

1:02:04.870 --> 1:02:07.120
Benjamin Joseph free, stop playing!

1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:09.200
Let's go.

1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.740
Sam! Jason!

1:02:23.330 --> 1:02:24.410
You there?

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:26.990
Hang on, buddy.

1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:31.540
Ben!

1:02:34.870 --> 1:02:36.790
Looks like he come through these trees.

1:02:41.830 --> 1:02:43.200
He was lying down here.

1:02:44.790 --> 1:02:46.450
Oh, my god! Benjamin!

1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:50.700
Sam, over here. Look.

1:03:01.291 --> 1:03:03.041
He probably took it off.

1:03:03.741 --> 1:03:06.331
He gets hot easily and he's an idiot.

1:03:07.701 --> 1:03:08.911
We're gonna find him, Sam.

1:03:10.741 --> 1:03:11.741
Don't lie.

1:03:12.331 --> 1:03:13.411
I promise.

1:03:15.161 --> 1:03:17.097
Of course, dad will come home
from his tour of duty.

1:03:17.121 --> 1:03:20.621
Why do adults think that we don't know
when you are lying?

1:03:20.701 --> 1:03:23.371
Look, I promise. I won't stop until we do.

1:03:23.451 --> 1:03:27.581
He doesn't have a coat.
His blood sugar is low.

1:03:28.081 --> 1:03:29.991
He's probably passed out.

1:03:31.491 --> 1:03:34.201
If we can find him,

1:03:34.291 --> 1:03:37.411
it will most likely
just be his body, Jason.

1:03:39.371 --> 1:03:43.371
Look, Sam. We can't stop lookin'.

1:03:43.451 --> 1:03:44.791
Alright?

1:03:44.871 --> 1:03:46.081
We can't give up.

1:03:47.911 --> 1:03:50.791
Hey, what would your mom say?

1:03:58.081 --> 1:03:59.451
What would mom say?

1:04:01.621 --> 1:04:02.722
Is that why you're searching?

1:04:02.742 --> 1:04:04.432
You're afraid
my mother will break up with you

1:04:04.452 --> 1:04:06.042
if you lose my brother?

1:04:11.162 --> 1:04:15.412
I'm so sorry for messing up
your perfect little checklist.

1:04:20.202 --> 1:04:23.832
Here is what I think about
your stupid little plan.

1:04:32.582 --> 1:04:36.792
Right now, all that matters
is that we find your brother.

1:04:38.912 --> 1:04:40.202
Not the checklist,

1:04:42.912 --> 1:04:43.952
not the ring.

1:04:45.702 --> 1:04:49.162
And not whether I'm gonna marry
your mother, alright?

1:04:50.452 --> 1:04:51.912
We gotta find Ben.

1:04:56.412 --> 1:04:57.412
Now come on.

1:04:59.872 --> 1:05:00.872
Ben!

1:05:07.662 --> 1:05:09.992
We're coming, buddy. Ben!

1:05:13.123 --> 1:05:14.123
Ben!

1:05:19.833 --> 1:05:21.453
Ben, we're coming, pal.

1:05:24.663 --> 1:05:28.913
It's been too long.
He's covered in snow by now.

1:05:30.453 --> 1:05:32.163
Look, we search as long as we can.

1:05:36.993 --> 1:05:37.993
Sam!

1:05:38.493 --> 1:05:39.543
Did you hear that?

1:05:39.623 --> 1:05:41.413
- What?
- Listen.

1:05:42.203 --> 1:05:43.453
Sam, are you there?

1:05:44.833 --> 1:05:45.833
This way.

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:03.163
Hi.

1:06:03.243 --> 1:06:04.583
Hi? That's all you have to say?

1:06:04.663 --> 1:06:08.043
You scared the crap out of me.
Don't do that ever again.

1:06:08.123 --> 1:06:09.703
- Hey!
- Oh, my god.

1:06:15.953 --> 1:06:17.123
Oh, no, your knife.

1:06:25.584 --> 1:06:27.374
Ben, time for a shot.

1:06:27.454 --> 1:06:29.624
My glucometer, it's broken.

1:06:29.704 --> 1:06:31.954
Your sugar's obviously low.
You need some glucogen.

1:06:48.664 --> 1:06:49.664
Jason...

1:06:52.584 --> 1:06:54.624
When was the last time
you saw your dad?

1:06:54.704 --> 1:06:55.954
- Ben!
- What?

1:06:56.044 --> 1:06:58.494
No, it's okay.

1:07:02.124 --> 1:07:03.454
When my mom died,

1:07:04.834 --> 1:07:05.874
he walked out.

1:07:06.704 --> 1:07:08.544
He said he never wanted
to see me again.

1:07:09.584 --> 1:07:10.834
I was probably about eight.

1:07:13.624 --> 1:07:16.954
Our dad died when I was eight. Sam was 12.

1:07:28.334 --> 1:07:29.454
Your mom says...

1:07:30.544 --> 1:07:33.084
She says your dad was
a really amazing guy.

1:07:34.495 --> 1:07:36.125
Wish I had a dad like that.

1:07:40.995 --> 1:07:42.495
Why didn't you want kids?

1:07:48.125 --> 1:07:49.245
You were afraid.

1:07:52.045 --> 1:07:55.705
My whole life, I was told I didn't fit in.

1:07:57.415 --> 1:08:01.835
My dad, the whole string
of foster families.

1:08:04.835 --> 1:08:06.085
Jessica, when she...

1:08:07.415 --> 1:08:09.205
She called off the engagement.

1:08:11.795 --> 1:08:13.875
I always wondered
if I had what it takes.

1:08:18.165 --> 1:08:22.045
Our dad was a really good dad.

1:08:24.125 --> 1:08:28.085
He didn't always save the day,
but he was there.

1:08:32.295 --> 1:08:34.125
He wasn't perfect, but...

1:08:35.745 --> 1:08:36.915
He loved us.

1:08:40.455 --> 1:08:43.956
Jason, a good dad does what he can...

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:47.876
Even if it's not enough.

1:08:59.376 --> 1:09:01.376
- What?!
- Time to get up.

1:09:01.456 --> 1:09:03.706
What? What is happening?

1:09:03.796 --> 1:09:05.126
Come on, time for breakfast.

1:09:12.296 --> 1:09:13.706
Alright, close your eyes.

1:09:13.796 --> 1:09:14.956
Close my eyes?

1:09:15.046 --> 1:09:16.046
Just close 'em.

1:09:16.706 --> 1:09:17.916
Stay right there.

1:09:19.246 --> 1:09:20.246
Okay.

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:26.126
Merry Christmas Eve.

1:09:34.746 --> 1:09:36.456
What's with the socks?

1:09:36.546 --> 1:09:38.416
It's stockings.

1:09:38.506 --> 1:09:40.416
One for each of you.

1:09:41.506 --> 1:09:44.046
Sam said I couldn't open mine
until you woke up.

1:09:46.836 --> 1:09:49.506
Yeah, I saved one of those coconut ones.

1:09:50.046 --> 1:09:51.706
Found it in my backpack this morning.

1:09:52.416 --> 1:09:54.997
Coconut is way better
than nothing. Thanks.

1:09:55.087 --> 1:09:56.087
Yeah.

1:09:59.997 --> 1:10:00.997
Go on.

1:10:03.627 --> 1:10:04.707
Go on.

1:10:20.587 --> 1:10:23.957
I know you and your family don't do gifts
until Christmas day.

1:10:24.047 --> 1:10:27.457
But in our family, we do Christmas Eve.

1:10:29.587 --> 1:10:30.587
Oh, god!

1:10:33.547 --> 1:10:35.087
Don't get all mushy on me.

1:10:40.547 --> 1:10:41.987
But I saw you throw it in the river.

1:10:44.797 --> 1:10:47.167
You saw me throw the box into the river.

1:10:51.167 --> 1:10:52.247
And...

1:10:57.877 --> 1:10:59.917
Breakfast is served.

1:10:59.997 --> 1:11:04.087
Apples, they're pretty sour.
There were still a few hanging on a tree.

1:11:05.748 --> 1:11:08.628
Sorry, I know you hate yellow,
but Ben insisted on the red one.

1:11:22.458 --> 1:11:23.458
Those are terrible.

1:11:23.548 --> 1:11:25.088
Even the squirrels don't want these.

1:11:25.838 --> 1:11:27.648
So, what were we supposed
to be doing this morning?

1:11:27.668 --> 1:11:28.918
According to your notebook?

1:11:31.508 --> 1:11:32.628
Let's see.

1:11:36.088 --> 1:11:38.338
I had planned pancakes, eggs and bacon,

1:11:38.418 --> 1:11:40.548
assuming your grandparents let me cook.

1:11:41.128 --> 1:11:44.378
Ah, I love pancakes. And bacon.

1:11:44.458 --> 1:11:45.588
Eggs are also good.

1:11:46.128 --> 1:11:48.458
Oh, and I bet grandma would make cookies.

1:11:48.548 --> 1:11:50.168
I love her cookies so much.

1:11:55.298 --> 1:11:56.298
Thank you.

1:11:59.248 --> 1:12:01.878
Last night you said
you didn't think I was ready

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:03.418
to be a part of this family.

1:12:05.248 --> 1:12:06.338
This means a lot.

1:12:08.128 --> 1:12:09.588
Parenting lesson number one,

1:12:10.548 --> 1:12:12.958
kids don't always mean
what they say in a blizzard

1:12:13.048 --> 1:12:15.129
when they're upset
and their brother is missing.

1:12:18.959 --> 1:12:23.749
So, is there a plan
or a five-point outline?

1:12:25.589 --> 1:12:31.129
Let's say we just stick together
and see what comes. How about that?

1:12:31.209 --> 1:12:32.209
I like that.

1:12:33.999 --> 1:12:34.999
Fine by me.

1:12:37.959 --> 1:12:39.549
First, let's start off with a prayer.

1:12:49.549 --> 1:12:52.709
Most loving father, thank you.

1:12:53.749 --> 1:12:55.259
Help us find our way...

1:12:56.419 --> 1:12:58.589
And thank you for watching over Ben
when I couldn't.

1:12:59.259 --> 1:13:00.259
Amen.

1:13:01.169 --> 1:13:02.169
Amen.

1:13:12.459 --> 1:13:13.509
Is that you, boy?

1:13:13.589 --> 1:13:15.839
Oh. Hey.

1:13:17.259 --> 1:13:19.999
Oh, my gosh, Jonah. This is grandpa's dog.

1:13:20.669 --> 1:13:22.459
Jonah, what happened to you, boy?

1:13:23.999 --> 1:13:25.289
It looks like he got in a fight.

1:13:27.670 --> 1:13:28.960
They're following us.

1:13:30.210 --> 1:13:32.750
They must be actually hunting us
if they've come this far.

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.050
What are we gonna do?

1:13:34.130 --> 1:13:36.550
We can't be far from the cabin
if Jonah's here.

1:13:36.630 --> 1:13:37.670
It's okay, Jonah.

1:13:38.260 --> 1:13:40.750
Look, let's get our things,
move quickly. Come on.

1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:44.260
Come on, boy, let's go.

1:13:59.510 --> 1:14:01.630
Jason, what do we do now?

1:14:05.130 --> 1:14:06.130
Cross here.

1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:13.750
That's it. That's it. Stay focused.

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:15.260
One step at a time.

1:14:20.130 --> 1:14:24.510
That's it, nice and easy.
And stay focused. Easy. Watch it.

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:28.960
Ben!

1:14:30.170 --> 1:14:31.300
Jason, help!

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.260
Ben, I got you.

1:14:37.261 --> 1:14:38.261
Come on.

1:14:40.001 --> 1:14:41.001
You good?

1:14:44.551 --> 1:14:47.211
Nice and easy. Alright.

1:14:48.841 --> 1:14:49.841
Come on.

1:14:58.961 --> 1:14:59.961
Come on.

1:15:00.881 --> 1:15:01.881
I got you.

1:15:07.001 --> 1:15:09.671
Jonah, where are you going?

1:15:29.671 --> 1:15:32.211
We climb. We'll cut some time off.

1:15:33.051 --> 1:15:36.881
- The wolves have to take a different path.
- I can't climb that.

1:15:39.841 --> 1:15:40.841
You can do it.

1:15:42.841 --> 1:15:45.341
Alright, just leave the pack. Let's go.

1:15:47.512 --> 1:15:48.552
Sam, come on.

1:15:59.512 --> 1:16:00.592
Good job, Sam.

1:16:02.962 --> 1:16:05.422
Ben, make sure you got a good hand hold.

1:16:06.342 --> 1:16:07.342
Yes, sir.

1:16:07.802 --> 1:16:08.802
I got you.

1:16:10.382 --> 1:16:11.512
That's it, that's it.

1:16:13.132 --> 1:16:14.132
That's it.

1:16:14.672 --> 1:16:15.672
Nice.

1:16:39.842 --> 1:16:41.512
That bought us some time, right?

1:16:48.052 --> 1:16:52.092
Few minutes, maybe.
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

1:17:06.013 --> 1:17:07.213
Get across this log.

1:17:10.053 --> 1:17:11.423
Jason, we have to hurry up.

1:17:12.633 --> 1:17:15.803
Your grandpa's cabin is on the Ridge
just behind this one.

1:17:16.553 --> 1:17:17.713
What are you doing?

1:17:19.173 --> 1:17:21.423
I'm gonna stay here
and hold back the wolves.

1:17:22.053 --> 1:17:24.133
You kids have gotta run, okay? Fast.

1:17:26.093 --> 1:17:27.513
Jason, you don't get it, do you?

1:17:29.173 --> 1:17:30.843
We stick together, no matter what.

1:17:30.923 --> 1:17:33.633
Look, you kids gotta run, okay? Now, go.

1:17:44.343 --> 1:17:46.263
Hurry, get behind this Boulder, alright?

1:17:57.423 --> 1:18:00.053
Father god, you have
to keep these kids safe.

1:18:00.633 --> 1:18:01.963
I've done everything I can.

1:18:08.554 --> 1:18:09.554
I can see 'em.

1:18:13.674 --> 1:18:15.264
Come on, just a little bit closer.

1:18:26.424 --> 1:18:28.174
They can tell we want 'em to keep coming.

1:18:35.964 --> 1:18:37.094
Come on.

1:18:40.054 --> 1:18:41.674
- Ben!
- Come on. There.

1:18:43.384 --> 1:18:46.634
Hey, over here!

1:18:56.964 --> 1:18:58.174
Yes!

1:19:17.844 --> 1:19:18.965
Jason!

1:19:48.425 --> 1:19:51.095
Jason! Jason, heads up.

1:20:03.095 --> 1:20:04.715
Samantha, Ben, come on.

1:20:10.215 --> 1:20:11.385
- Grandpa.
- Jonah!

1:20:31.556 --> 1:20:33.676
What are you three doing
way out here anyway?

1:20:33.756 --> 1:20:35.926
We wanted to come and surprise you.

1:20:36.016 --> 1:20:37.596
Well, color me surprised.

1:20:39.426 --> 1:20:40.716
Oh, you're awake.

1:20:45.806 --> 1:20:47.016
Pine needle tea.

1:20:55.846 --> 1:20:56.966
It tastes terrible.

1:20:57.466 --> 1:20:58.966
Yeah. No one likes it.

1:21:01.056 --> 1:21:02.056
Thanks.

1:21:05.596 --> 1:21:06.886
Grandma made these.

1:21:09.136 --> 1:21:10.926
How did you find us all the way out here?

1:21:12.016 --> 1:21:14.806
Well, Jonah showed up. Wouldn't let me be.

1:21:14.886 --> 1:21:16.806
Barking, whimpering, howlin'.

1:21:18.176 --> 1:21:20.056
He never stays
where he's supposed to.

1:21:20.136 --> 1:21:23.016
But when that dog's
got something important to say,

1:21:23.096 --> 1:21:24.386
you know it.

1:21:24.466 --> 1:21:28.346
With the storm coming and all,
I brought some supplies.

1:21:28.426 --> 1:21:29.516
I'm glad I did.

1:21:31.676 --> 1:21:34.516
I thought we should let you rest
before we made the rest of our journey.

1:21:43.597 --> 1:21:45.177
Are you gonna have one?

1:21:45.267 --> 1:21:46.307
Yeah, can I?

1:21:47.927 --> 1:21:50.637
I can't believe you tried
to take that wolf with your bare hands.

1:21:52.347 --> 1:21:54.467
- I had to protect the kids.
- Jonah!

1:21:56.767 --> 1:21:59.177
I'm told you have plans
for my daughter and her kids.

1:22:01.597 --> 1:22:02.597
Yes, sir.

1:22:04.017 --> 1:22:08.097
If everyone agrees to them.

1:22:08.767 --> 1:22:11.467
I feel like I've been
making plans for myself

1:22:11.557 --> 1:22:12.887
for way too long now.

1:22:15.467 --> 1:22:17.217
You know,
I had some doubts about you.

1:22:18.767 --> 1:22:20.307
Noelle told me your story.

1:22:21.177 --> 1:22:24.887
That girl sure has a way
of seeing people true.

1:22:28.137 --> 1:22:31.717
Sir, to be honest,
I don't know if I'm ready.

1:22:34.017 --> 1:22:35.017
Can I join you?

1:22:36.927 --> 1:22:37.927
Sure.

1:22:46.217 --> 1:22:51.268
Son, a father...
A father stands in the gap.

1:22:53.308 --> 1:22:55.308
Kids on one side, wolves on the other.

1:22:57.098 --> 1:23:01.308
He says whatever comes,
nothing gets to those kids.

1:23:04.178 --> 1:23:07.518
He doesn't have to win,
but he's gotta stand there.

1:23:08.678 --> 1:23:10.678
Gives his life if that's what it comes to.

1:23:13.468 --> 1:23:15.058
I saw you do that today.

1:23:18.888 --> 1:23:20.018
I'm gonna mess up.

1:23:23.348 --> 1:23:26.138
Oh, of course you will.

1:23:28.468 --> 1:23:31.928
But you know what? You'll be family, kid.

1:23:34.638 --> 1:23:37.058
I'll be here to give you fatherly advice
when you need it.

1:23:37.808 --> 1:23:39.428
Whether you want it or not.

1:23:45.468 --> 1:23:47.058
Well, snow's letting up.

1:23:50.138 --> 1:23:52.218
We should get those kids and head on home.

1:23:53.888 --> 1:23:56.348
- Can you give me a minute?
- Yes, sir.

1:24:20.639 --> 1:24:22.809
Making a new plan
to convince mom to marry you?

1:24:25.809 --> 1:24:26.809
No.

1:24:27.519 --> 1:24:29.469
Actually, I'm making
a different kind of list.

1:24:31.139 --> 1:24:32.679
I've got some things I need to say.

1:24:34.429 --> 1:24:35.559
To both of you.

1:24:36.389 --> 1:24:37.769
Ben, starting with you.

1:24:40.429 --> 1:24:43.349
Look, I know I ate more cookies
than everyone else.

1:24:43.429 --> 1:24:45.679
But I blame my blood sugar thing.

1:24:49.969 --> 1:24:53.389
Ben, I love how you do
whatever comes to your head.

1:24:54.059 --> 1:24:58.809
You're kind and you're willing to help
even if it gets you into trouble.

1:25:00.519 --> 1:25:02.469
I love how you look after your sister.

1:25:03.309 --> 1:25:06.059
And I'm an excellent atv driver.

1:25:13.100 --> 1:25:17.560
And... I want you to have this.

1:25:22.970 --> 1:25:24.720
But that's your special knife.

1:25:24.810 --> 1:25:26.520
There's a story in the Bible.

1:25:28.390 --> 1:25:30.930
Sky opens up,
and the voice from heaven,

1:25:31.020 --> 1:25:34.270
god the father says, 'this is my son,

1:25:34.350 --> 1:25:35.430
'my beloved son.'

1:25:36.770 --> 1:25:38.850
this was before Jesus did anything.

1:25:40.060 --> 1:25:42.520
He hasn't healed anyone. No miracles.

1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:44.930
Hadn't died for anyone's sins.

1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:49.220
And god said, 'i love him
because of who he is.

1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:51.600
'Not because of what he's done.'

1:25:55.470 --> 1:25:58.270
this knife, it's a reminder...

1:26:00.020 --> 1:26:01.310
That whatever happens...

1:26:02.310 --> 1:26:03.890
I love you 'cause you're Ben.

1:26:18.390 --> 1:26:22.061
Sam, I love how you tell the truth...

1:26:23.521 --> 1:26:24.721
Even when it hurts.

1:26:26.561 --> 1:26:29.971
I love how protective you are
of your mom and your brother.

1:26:33.021 --> 1:26:34.351
There's so much life in you.

1:26:37.181 --> 1:26:38.891
You gave me the best Christmas gift.

1:26:41.851 --> 1:26:43.811
You'll never be part of a project

1:26:43.891 --> 1:26:45.271
or a checklist to me.

1:26:47.141 --> 1:26:48.851
I just wanna be in your life.

1:26:50.101 --> 1:26:51.471
No matter what happens.

1:27:05.391 --> 1:27:06.391
Come on, Jonah.

1:27:13.721 --> 1:27:17.561
- Nice speech. But you forgot something.
- Oh, yeah, what's that?

1:27:17.641 --> 1:27:18.641
Come on, Jonah.

1:27:18.721 --> 1:27:20.271
Where's my beloved daughter knife?

1:27:22.391 --> 1:27:23.851
Parenting lesson number two,

1:27:24.431 --> 1:27:25.931
can't play favorites with the kids.

1:27:26.471 --> 1:27:27.601
Well, I'll get you one.

1:27:28.221 --> 1:27:29.721
Ah, I'll be 16 soon.

1:27:30.431 --> 1:27:32.078
You can just paint it
on the side of the new car

1:27:32.102 --> 1:27:33.102
you and mom get me.

1:27:34.102 --> 1:27:36.642
And I'm gonna need a new pole
if we're gonna go fishing.

1:27:40.892 --> 1:27:42.972
Alright, come on, kids.
Let's get a move on.

1:27:43.892 --> 1:27:44.972
It's gettin' dark.

1:27:47.682 --> 1:27:48.682
Hold on a minute.

1:27:48.772 --> 1:27:50.182
I got one more fatherhood test

1:27:50.272 --> 1:27:51.972
to make sure you're completely ready.

1:27:53.062 --> 1:27:54.142
Alright, let's hear it.

1:27:54.222 --> 1:27:56.472
How is my hand like a lemon pie?

1:27:57.852 --> 1:28:01.222
- What?
- How is my hand like a lemon pie?

1:28:02.722 --> 1:28:03.772
I don't know.

1:28:03.852 --> 1:28:05.602
It's got my ring on it.

1:28:05.682 --> 1:28:08.022
Grandpa, not that joke again.

1:28:08.102 --> 1:28:11.562
Meringue. My ring.
It's got meringue on it.

1:28:13.142 --> 1:28:15.972
Dad jokes are a key skill
for any father to cultivate.

1:28:16.062 --> 1:28:18.142
I got a whole book of 'em
back at the cabin.

1:28:18.222 --> 1:28:19.352
Let's go, troops.

1:28:19.432 --> 1:28:20.682
Come on.

1:28:20.772 --> 1:28:22.562
You seriously need to stop with that joke.

1:28:30.222 --> 1:28:32.062
Cabin's just over the rise.

1:28:34.222 --> 1:28:35.222
Jason.

1:28:47.393 --> 1:28:49.433
Come on, Jonah. Mom!

1:28:51.813 --> 1:28:52.853
Mom!

1:28:56.853 --> 1:28:58.973
What are you all doing out in the cold?

1:29:01.063 --> 1:29:02.103
You still have the ring?

1:29:10.813 --> 1:29:12.273
What do you think she's gonna say?

1:29:13.473 --> 1:29:14.603
Let's go find out.
