him, but I saw him first.

Other life.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.265

that chocolate is so good?

00:24.399 --> 00:26.109
{\an1}How has she never
had chocolate?

00:26.192 --> 00:27.652
Maybe her parents
are hippies.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.154
You know, granola
and veggies and stuff.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.156
Oh wow.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.241
Broccoli is even better.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.159

broccoli?

00:43.168 --> 00:47.005

chocolate mixed together.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.256
Broccolate.

00:48.339 --> 00:49.299
You can do that?!

00:49.382 --> 00:50.091
Nah, I just
made it up.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.135

butter cup.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.636

00:53.720 --> 00:54.304

gymnastics practice,

"See YOU later?"

01:13.198 --> 01:15.158

like, "See ya later!"

01:15.241 --> 01:17.494

01:37.263 --> 01:41.309

equipment oversight.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.352
Why?

01:42.435 --> 01:43.728
Because I'm a genius.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.231
If I'm on a team, then I
don't have to take P.E.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.066

no sweating.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.693

"Good Morning!"

02:13.550 --> 02:15.343

Devon!

09:03.042 --> 09:04.794

to see you!

09:04.877 --> 09:05.962
Tough practice

the oatmeal?

the oatmeal?

{\an1}Interested is like,
five above good.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.608
{\an1}It means he made the
effort to think about you,

09:27.692 --> 09:29.610
{\an1}which means he's not
playing his video games.

that's huge.

something else.

Your socks?

09:48.337 --> 09:49.630
Well, where I come from, if
you warm someone's feet,

09:49.714 --> 09:50.631

Meeting adjourned.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.152
In the event of a tie,
the principal decides.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.322
Really?

18:35.405 --> 18:37.199
Again Gigi?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.535
Fine, we'll present
our themes

18:39.618 --> 18:41.745
to Principal Williams
and she'll decide.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.706
Oh, did I mention
she's my aunt?

18:45.499 --> 18:46.500
Yeah.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.167
That just happened.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.253
Good luck!

It'll be okay, Astral.

Just give it time.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.949
Time is what
I don't have.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.493
We have four years of
high school ahead of us.

Anything can happen.

Winston Percival Althazar.

19:55.694 --> 20:00.991
The rather strict professor,
earthly looking one, said that

20:01.074 --> 20:04.953
if I sit on this bridge, I'll
earn my wizard powers.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.581
Old Versitudey
said that, did she?

20:07.664 --> 20:08.290
I'm afraid it's not
working, though.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.792
I must be doing
something wrong.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.502
Oh you're doing
perfectly.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.630
But it'll take two months
of sitting there

20:14.713 --> 20:16.089
before you get
your powers.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.007
Two months?

'Fraid so.

I'm sure you're not interested.

your name.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.520
Professor Brendoni.

wreath of stink weed.
