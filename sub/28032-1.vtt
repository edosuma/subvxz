01:59.668 --> 02:02.839
Dad,
when are you coming home?

02:10.812 --> 02:12.046
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

02:12.048 --> 02:14.314
<i>when you come home,
can you bring me a, um...</i>

02:14.316 --> 02:15.651
<i>Bring me a...</i>

02:25.962 --> 02:27.527
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

02:27.529 --> 02:31.032
<i>I'm building a little boat
just like yours.</i>

02:31.034 --> 02:32.733
<i>A bit smaller.</i>

02:32.735 --> 02:35.905
<i>It's got a ship's wheel,
some sails, and an anchor.</i>

02:41.945 --> 02:44.446
Come back soon,
little pigeon.

02:46.281 --> 02:47.781
Morten?

02:47.783 --> 02:51.284
Come on, Morten.
It's the dress rehearsal.

02:51.286 --> 02:54.155
We've got to dance
for Mom and Dad, remember?

02:59.361 --> 03:01.330
I'm not dancing, Elizabeth.

03:04.067 --> 03:08.470
And those two stuffed parrots
are your mom and dad, not mine.

03:10.206 --> 03:13.673
What sort
of spelling is that?

03:13.675 --> 03:17.277
You'd better fix it,
or I might have to sack you.

03:17.279 --> 03:18.912
This isn't our job.

03:18.914 --> 03:20.847
We're not sign writers.

03:20.849 --> 03:22.883
Or people that can spell.

03:22.885 --> 03:24.284
We are sailors.

03:25.721 --> 03:29.556
The only sea you've ever sailed
in is that bottle of lemonade.

03:29.558 --> 03:32.926
We've got
the tattoos to prove it.

03:32.928 --> 03:34.995
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.466
Sailors indeed.

03:39.001 --> 03:44.138
All that work for a bowl
of soup and a few donuts?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.441
What kind of life is that?

03:46.909 --> 03:48.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:59.054 --> 04:00.823
Morten!

04:08.730 --> 04:10.566
Oh, Morten!

04:14.103 --> 04:15.104
Morten!

04:21.277 --> 04:22.511
Morten!

04:43.765 --> 04:44.833
Mm.

05:07.756 --> 05:09.589
- Ow!
- Leave that fish alone.

05:09.591 --> 05:11.858
What do you mean?
I'm sailing my boat.

05:11.860 --> 05:13.393
Don't contradict me.

05:13.395 --> 05:16.364
Ugh! Ow!

05:16.366 --> 05:18.800
But a Captain never
abandons his ship.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.768
Aah!

05:23.872 --> 05:27.175
You are no Captain,
and that's no ship.

05:29.044 --> 05:30.344
It is a ship!

05:30.346 --> 05:32.681
And I am a Captain!

05:41.223 --> 05:42.856
One-Eye was one of

05:42.858 --> 05:45.859
the most mysterious figures
in the pirate history,

05:45.861 --> 05:51.399
some historians think he died after
being marooned on a desert island

05:51.401 --> 05:54.734
by his mutinous crew.

05:54.736 --> 05:59.041
Some think, along with his
gold, he lost his mind.

06:03.578 --> 06:06.513
There's a storm coming!

06:06.515 --> 06:08.581
Douse the sails!

06:08.583 --> 06:13.253
<i>In a moment of madness,
he thought his castle was his ship.</i>

06:13.255 --> 06:16.589
Steady! Now, my beauty!

06:16.591 --> 06:20.929
Take me to my treasure!

06:31.407 --> 06:33.441
Huh?

06:50.392 --> 06:51.893
Morten!

07:00.402 --> 07:01.570
Huh?

07:02.904 --> 07:03.872
Oh.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.877
Whoo-hoo!

07:09.144 --> 07:10.944
Dad!

07:10.946 --> 07:13.215
Morten!

07:14.616 --> 07:16.216
Whoa, whoa.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.152
Huh?

07:20.622 --> 07:22.822
Did you have
a good trip, Captain?

07:22.824 --> 07:26.192
Oh, strange things happen
at sea, Morten.

07:26.194 --> 07:28.695
Did I ever tell you
about the dancing whales?

07:28.697 --> 07:31.566
As light on their tailfins
as ballerinas.

07:32.502 --> 07:34.200
Where is Morten?

07:34.202 --> 07:35.368
He's in his room.

07:35.370 --> 07:37.804
That is so unprofessional.

07:37.806 --> 07:39.672
What's he doing in his room?

07:39.674 --> 07:41.708
You shoved him
in there, remember?

07:41.710 --> 07:44.110
Don't talk back. Now...

07:44.112 --> 07:45.678
First position.

07:46.948 --> 07:47.949
Up.

07:49.418 --> 07:50.719
Higher.

07:59.961 --> 08:03.096
How can I have an artistic
thought in my head

08:03.098 --> 08:06.433
when there are
all these interruptions?

08:08.437 --> 08:09.971
Here I am.

08:14.443 --> 08:17.243
Oh, Captain Viks.

08:17.245 --> 08:18.745
Welcome back.

08:18.747 --> 08:20.613
Make yourself at home.

08:20.615 --> 08:21.850
Thank you.

08:24.619 --> 08:26.855
Hmm. How did you get out...

08:27.389 --> 08:30.358
Such lovely curls.

08:31.493 --> 08:34.626
So, Captain, I imagine
your trip was full

08:34.629 --> 08:38.530
of the most
unbelievable adventures.

08:38.533 --> 08:41.600
All believable, but fascinating.

08:41.602 --> 08:44.437
<i>When I was sailing
in the south seas,</i>

08:44.439 --> 08:46.406
<i>I was invited to tea</i>

08:46.408 --> 08:48.176
<i>by some friendly locals.</i>

08:50.579 --> 08:51.847
Aah!

08:55.083 --> 08:58.053
<i>We had decks to swab
and ropes to knot.</i>

08:59.287 --> 09:01.287
<i>We didn't have time
to hang around simmering</i>

09:01.289 --> 09:03.189
<i>until I was tender.</i>

09:03.191 --> 09:06.627
<i>So, I had to decline
their kind invitation.</i>

09:13.634 --> 09:15.768
<i>And as chance would have it...</i>

09:15.770 --> 09:19.172
<i>we met an old friend
who took me back to the ship.</i>

09:19.174 --> 09:21.877
<i>That pigeon earned
his corn always.</i>

09:29.317 --> 09:31.887
Then it was time for me
to come back home.

09:33.355 --> 09:37.590
Oh. How exciting
that must have been, Captain.

09:37.592 --> 09:39.658
Incredible.

09:39.660 --> 09:44.164
Ah,
the best donuts in the world.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.834
Mmm. Divine.

09:47.836 --> 09:50.336
Light as a butterfly,
Elizabeth. Remember.

09:50.338 --> 09:52.274
No donuts for you, dear.

09:53.341 --> 09:54.976
Huh?

09:57.479 --> 09:59.112
Time to weigh anchor.

09:59.114 --> 10:00.413
Already?

10:00.415 --> 10:02.681
Time and tide wait for no man.

10:13.228 --> 10:14.296
Go away.

10:15.931 --> 10:18.833
Aye, aye, Captain.
Anchors away.

10:21.036 --> 10:22.170
Uh...

10:22.736 --> 10:24.571
You miss your mother?

10:24.573 --> 10:26.041
We do too, you know?

10:27.042 --> 10:29.277
<i>I wish she'd never gone
to sail with me.</i>

10:30.145 --> 10:32.212
<i>It was so cold
at the South Pole that</i>

10:32.214 --> 10:34.815
<i>we thought we'd never make it
back to the ship.</i>

10:36.484 --> 10:40.220
<i>That's when your mother
decided to become a penguin.</i>

10:40.222 --> 10:41.787
<i>We don't blame her.</i>

10:41.789 --> 10:44.092
<i>Most easily, become one myself.</i>

10:56.538 --> 10:59.107
You know that's not true, Dad.

11:02.644 --> 11:03.742
Time to go.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.746
I want to come with you.

11:08.617 --> 11:10.252
One day, I'll take you.

11:11.386 --> 11:12.685
In the meantime,

11:12.687 --> 11:15.823
you might want to store the
anchor for that ship of yours.

11:18.593 --> 11:20.328
You'll be brave now, won't you?

11:27.402 --> 11:31.770
You needn't worry.
We are very happy to look after Morten.

11:31.772 --> 11:35.843
We love him as if he
were our own child.

11:36.645 --> 11:38.246
Not much to shell
from this trip.

11:40.348 --> 11:41.281
Hmm.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.816
No.
Hardly dents your account.

11:44.818 --> 11:47.720
He'll never be able to pay us
what he owes us.

11:47.722 --> 11:49.389
Don't worry, my dear.

11:49.391 --> 11:51.192
I have a plan.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.597
I'll find all
the One-eye's pirate gold

11:57.599 --> 12:02.170
if we have to pull every nail
out of its stinking hull.

12:21.389 --> 12:22.457
Morten?

12:24.492 --> 12:26.294
That's beautiful.

12:28.763 --> 12:29.830
Oh.

12:30.665 --> 12:31.533
Huh?

12:34.001 --> 12:37.537
Be a good lad and tell you
mother Mr. Stinger is here.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.870
She's not my mother.

12:38.872 --> 12:41.174
Just tell her.

12:41.176 --> 12:43.909
And say out of my way
when I visit

12:43.911 --> 12:46.314
my Butterfly Queen.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.436
Wanna go to the show?

13:10.438 --> 13:12.338
Yeah. Why not?

13:12.340 --> 13:13.541
Come on, Killer.

13:14.809 --> 13:17.312
Fog machine.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.614
<i>Unbelievemente.</i>

13:21.616 --> 13:23.750
<i>Incredibile.</i>

13:23.752 --> 13:28.989
Maestro Cucaracha super check.

13:32.861 --> 13:34.627
Buy a ticket. It's very cheap.

13:34.629 --> 13:37.563
Come on.

13:39.133 --> 13:40.000
Woof.

13:49.176 --> 13:52.378
- Change this doggy.
- Huh?

13:52.380 --> 13:53.513
Wait and see.

13:56.984 --> 13:59.519
- <i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>
- That's some trick.

14:00.488 --> 14:02.055
Whoops.

14:03.391 --> 14:07.092
We used to queue
for hours to watch you dance.

14:09.831 --> 14:11.464
Oh, please.

14:11.466 --> 14:15.435
Don't bring up
those unpleasant memories.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.110
Aah!

14:30.083 --> 14:35.120
A most unfortunate
accident indeed.

14:35.122 --> 14:39.057
Nowadays,
I choreograph ballets.

14:39.059 --> 14:42.027
I call this piece
"Butterfly in Blue."

14:42.029 --> 14:43.896
You can be first mate.

14:43.898 --> 14:46.031
Morten, pay attention.

14:46.033 --> 14:48.333
Turn Killer back now.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.605
He doesn't like being little.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.138
And possibly, dead.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.675
There's just
a slight technicality.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.312
A dimensional problem.
Just give me a second.

14:58.913 --> 15:01.581
Cucaracha Caputo.

15:02.884 --> 15:06.051
- Look. Over there! Dolphins!
- Huh?

15:06.053 --> 15:09.655
Those are penguins, you liar.
Cheat, get him!

15:16.063 --> 15:18.631
Come back!
Hold it right there.

15:22.770 --> 15:24.606
Stop that at once.

15:24.973 --> 15:26.171
Oh!

15:26.173 --> 15:28.474
So unprofessional.

15:28.476 --> 15:29.777
I said stop it!

15:31.846 --> 15:33.748
Felix, go and check.

15:36.851 --> 15:38.484
Aha!

15:38.486 --> 15:39.952
What have we here?

15:41.021 --> 15:42.788
A spider!

15:47.529 --> 15:48.630
Oh!

15:49.463 --> 15:50.730
Bravo!

15:50.732 --> 15:52.097
Did you like it?

15:52.099 --> 15:54.502
Oh, the finale was just...

15:54.936 --> 15:56.502
Astonishing!

15:56.504 --> 15:59.204
Oh, imagine what I
could do if I had a real theater

15:59.206 --> 16:01.039
with professional dancers.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.575
But...

16:02.577 --> 16:04.744
That would cost so much.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.345
The Captain owes you money.
Make him pay up.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.481
Captain Viks
hasn't got any money.

16:09.483 --> 16:11.017
He'll never pay me
what he owes me

16:11.019 --> 16:13.653
for looking after
that boy of his.

16:13.655 --> 16:15.420
But what about the boat?

16:15.422 --> 16:19.659
Nobody would buy
that stinky old rust bucket.

16:19.661 --> 16:22.294
I wouldn't be so sure.

16:22.296 --> 16:25.865
Someone might
get tricked into it.

16:25.867 --> 16:30.903
Let me sign your guestbook
with my golden pen before I go.

16:30.905 --> 16:32.504
Please do.

16:32.506 --> 16:35.106
There's a place where
you can leave a comment.

16:35.108 --> 16:37.077
About my ballet.

16:37.745 --> 16:38.780
Oh!

16:44.418 --> 16:47.285
Come on.
This is the ship's wheel.

16:47.287 --> 16:49.354
You have to go
and hang on to it.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.523
Goodbye, my dear.

16:51.525 --> 16:55.728
A real sailor wouldn't play with
a boat like that in the bath.

16:55.730 --> 16:58.398
<i>Salamander.</i>

17:00.367 --> 17:04.538
Zigfred, Zackfred,
your'e wanted.

17:05.405 --> 17:06.641
Gotcha.

17:11.045 --> 17:12.445
All right. We're coming.

17:23.992 --> 17:27.527
Uh, uh. What do you think?
Spanner?

17:27.962 --> 17:29.661
Hacksaw? Hammer?

17:29.663 --> 17:31.529
Eh, chewing gum?

17:31.531 --> 17:32.664
Oh, good man.

17:32.666 --> 17:33.634
Thanks.

17:36.336 --> 17:38.740
Not for you, you fool!

17:39.774 --> 17:43.943
Easy for a pair
of old sailors like us.

17:48.116 --> 17:49.648
Aah!

17:52.787 --> 17:55.153
My lovely floor!

17:55.155 --> 17:57.056
Uh. No, no problem.

17:57.058 --> 18:00.258
No problem. We can fix it.
We can fix this.

18:00.260 --> 18:03.263
No problem. It's okay.

18:03.630 --> 18:04.564
Aah!

18:13.273 --> 18:14.909
It's a beautiful ship.

18:15.943 --> 18:17.308
Just magic.

18:17.310 --> 18:19.377
If it was a real ship,

18:19.379 --> 18:21.847
with real sailors...

18:21.849 --> 18:23.115
I would be... Ow!

18:23.117 --> 18:25.216
This is all your fault.

18:25.218 --> 18:27.719
I give you food,
an education, culture...

18:27.721 --> 18:30.823
And you just throw it
back in my face.

18:30.825 --> 18:33.591
You, and that father of yours
will be begging in the streets

18:33.593 --> 18:35.262
by the time
I'm finished with you.

18:44.705 --> 18:46.538
Dad, where are you?

18:46.540 --> 18:48.809
Hmm?

19:06.493 --> 19:08.259
Stupido machine, stop!

20:32.146 --> 20:33.013
Ya!

20:40.620 --> 20:41.655
Mm.

20:50.097 --> 20:51.398
Whoa.

21:41.114 --> 21:42.515
I'm a Captain.

21:43.217 --> 21:44.818
And this is my ship.

21:48.388 --> 21:50.090
Aye, aye, Captain Morten.

21:54.027 --> 21:56.295
Prepare to cast off.

21:56.297 --> 21:58.098
Aye, aye, Captain Morten.

21:58.999 --> 22:00.133
Whoa.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.470
Full steam ahead!

22:22.789 --> 22:26.958
- Perhaps my brother and I...
- Can be of assistance?

22:26.960 --> 22:30.595
Yes. You hold her steady
while I check the rigging.

22:35.369 --> 22:38.169
Is that your idea of a joke?

22:38.171 --> 22:39.973
Very funny. Ha ha.

22:41.474 --> 22:44.044
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

22:44.544 --> 22:46.312
I'm the Captain.

22:46.314 --> 22:48.414
The Captain.

22:48.416 --> 22:50.583
Stop it. Let me go!

22:51.818 --> 22:53.687
Let go of me.

22:54.888 --> 22:57.288
Time for a bit
of swimming practice.

22:57.290 --> 22:58.957
But I can't swim.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.092
Well, that's just
too bad, isn't it?

23:01.094 --> 23:04.564
It's never
too late to learn.

23:05.198 --> 23:08.299
Help! Somebody!

23:08.301 --> 23:10.036
Gentlemen?

23:12.906 --> 23:15.374
Can you please
refrain from shouting?

23:15.376 --> 23:17.075
The queen is asleep.

23:17.077 --> 23:18.543
- It was him!
- Whoa, Whoa!

23:18.545 --> 23:19.811
No.

23:19.813 --> 23:21.512
You're the one
that was shouting.

23:26.753 --> 23:30.254
Good gracious. Who is this
unfortunate creature?

23:30.256 --> 23:32.525
I have no idea.

23:32.826 --> 23:34.559
Help!

23:34.561 --> 23:36.229
- Help!
- Hmm.

23:37.297 --> 23:39.664
Lovely day for a swim.

23:39.666 --> 23:41.366
Have we met before?

23:41.368 --> 23:44.268
Help! Somebody!

23:44.270 --> 23:46.270
Don't just stand there,
you fools.

23:46.272 --> 23:48.908
- Rescue him.
- Oh. Right.

23:49.376 --> 23:50.910
Help.

23:53.346 --> 23:54.480
Careful with him.

23:54.482 --> 23:56.881
He looks as if he might break.

23:56.883 --> 23:59.052
Whoa.

24:06.359 --> 24:10.161
Parson, these sea-men are
out of control.

24:10.163 --> 24:12.096
Lock them in the hull!

24:12.098 --> 24:13.464
Of course. Aye, aye.

24:13.466 --> 24:16.036
<i>Avec plaisir.</i> Right away.

24:20.140 --> 24:21.606
Throw him in the hull.

24:21.608 --> 24:22.876
He can be next.

24:52.639 --> 24:53.773
Is that sugar?

25:11.458 --> 25:12.892
Huh?

25:21.668 --> 25:23.634
Hey, don't touch me!

25:23.636 --> 25:24.971
Who's that?

25:25.405 --> 25:26.873
Eliza.

25:27.774 --> 25:29.275
What are you doing here?

25:30.977 --> 25:33.578
I was just minding
my own business,

25:33.580 --> 25:35.215
enjoying the sunshine.

25:41.754 --> 25:44.055
<i>Then suddenly something
picked me up,</i>

25:44.057 --> 25:47.026
<i>and flung me
into this dark pit.</i>

25:48.862 --> 25:50.828
<i>I tried eating my way out,</i>

25:50.830 --> 25:52.597
<i>but that just made
things worse.</i>

25:52.599 --> 25:54.267
Whoa!

25:59.472 --> 26:03.474
<i>I had to plug the hole,
and I've been sitting here ever since.</i>

26:03.476 --> 26:09.413
Sitting, and sitting. I'll probably
go on sitting here forever and ever.

26:09.415 --> 26:12.550
What kinda person would
do something like that?

26:12.552 --> 26:16.921
I mean, throw me
into this dungeon.

26:16.923 --> 26:20.126
I'm sure whoever did it
didn't mean to hurt you.

26:20.593 --> 26:21.826
Aw!

26:21.828 --> 26:24.495
Oh, please stop crying.

26:24.497 --> 26:25.832
We'll sort it out.

26:28.334 --> 26:30.968
Hey, you up there.
Hurry.

26:30.970 --> 26:32.736
There's a hole in the hull.

26:32.738 --> 26:35.039
Quiet down, you idiot.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.641
What's the matter with you?

26:36.643 --> 26:40.378
- Can't you hear me?
- What is that awful noise?

26:40.380 --> 26:42.779
It's a surprise for you.

26:42.781 --> 26:43.981
You'll love it.

26:43.983 --> 26:46.716
Always looking out for me,
aren't you, Felix?

26:46.718 --> 26:48.421
I do my best, <i>mon amour.</i>

26:49.656 --> 26:50.722
Ha!

26:51.958 --> 26:55.761
Prepare the prisoner.
I want him all in one piece.

27:00.266 --> 27:02.233
<i>Make way for the queen.</i>

27:04.137 --> 27:07.706
All kneel
for Her Majesty, the queen.

27:09.342 --> 27:13.413
Long live her most
beautiful gorgeousness.

27:14.447 --> 27:15.479
Huh?

27:15.481 --> 27:18.084
Long live the queen.

27:23.656 --> 27:27.558
Thank you,
my dear loyal subjects.

27:27.560 --> 27:32.263
And don't worry. I shall definitely
live longer than any of you.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.468
A guest.

27:37.103 --> 27:40.839
A very tasty guest,
my lovely Queen.

27:41.541 --> 27:43.274
Why isn't he kneeling?

27:43.276 --> 27:47.877
Well, you always wanted to know
what little boys are made of.

27:47.879 --> 27:51.382
Oh, yes. He's very little.

27:51.384 --> 27:53.551
And so cute.

27:53.553 --> 27:55.785
This is your Captain speaking!

27:55.787 --> 27:57.021
There's a hole in the hull.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.425
I repeat,
there's a hole in the hull.

28:00.326 --> 28:01.726
Who told you that?

28:01.728 --> 28:04.228
I saw it for myself.

28:04.230 --> 28:05.730
I'm sure you didn't.

28:05.732 --> 28:08.765
Yes, I did. With my own eyes.

28:08.767 --> 28:10.067
We need to patch it up.

28:10.069 --> 28:11.504
Or we'll sink.

28:15.874 --> 28:19.345
Hmm. I think not.

28:35.528 --> 28:36.529
Oh!

28:45.937 --> 28:48.004
In case you hadn't noticed,

28:48.006 --> 28:50.574
I'm the one in charge here.

28:50.576 --> 28:52.243
If I say, "Bow,"

28:52.245 --> 28:54.211
you bow.

28:54.213 --> 28:55.346
If I say, "Jump,"

28:55.348 --> 28:59.015
you ask, "How, how?"

28:59.017 --> 29:02.520
Most important of all,
when I say, "Dance,"

29:02.522 --> 29:04.588
you'll dance. Felix?

29:04.590 --> 29:06.292
Music please.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.162
With pleasure.

29:30.450 --> 29:31.317
Mm?

29:38.658 --> 29:40.524
What do you think, Annabelle?

29:40.526 --> 29:42.226
Time to eat?

29:42.228 --> 29:47.200
Nothing like a work of art
to stimulate the appetite.

29:48.368 --> 29:50.468
This one's very fresh.

29:50.470 --> 29:55.373
On the other hand,
you are a good dancer.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.607
Really?

29:56.609 --> 30:00.011
And do we really need two wasps?

30:00.813 --> 30:02.580
After all, they're identical.

30:02.582 --> 30:05.850
Same tattoos, same stingers,
same personality.

30:05.852 --> 30:08.319
What's the point of having two?

30:08.321 --> 30:09.854
No, no, no.

30:09.856 --> 30:11.689
We're totally different.

30:11.691 --> 30:13.156
Nothing like each other.

30:13.158 --> 30:15.892
Absolutely nothing in common.
Goodbye, bro.

30:15.894 --> 30:17.862
Oh, I'll miss you.

30:17.864 --> 30:20.096
No, I think not as much
as I miss you.

30:20.098 --> 30:22.600
No, really. I'll miss you more.

30:22.602 --> 30:24.100
I'll miss you much more.

30:35.882 --> 30:37.515
Stop that at once.

30:37.517 --> 30:38.684
We'll have no fighting.

30:40.986 --> 30:42.919
We'll just leave it to chance.

30:42.921 --> 30:44.189
Shall we?

30:45.391 --> 30:46.359
Huh.

30:54.734 --> 30:55.701
Huh?

31:09.014 --> 31:11.183
Aah! No. No!

31:11.950 --> 31:13.983
Best of three. Best of three.

31:13.985 --> 31:15.486
Please, best of three!

31:15.488 --> 31:17.222
I don't think so.

31:25.465 --> 31:26.566
Whoa!

31:27.299 --> 31:28.298
Aah!

32:04.135 --> 32:08.073
Oh. The best donuts
in the world.

32:09.542 --> 32:11.074
And all possible

32:11.076 --> 32:14.845
because of the sacrifice
made by a heroic wasp.

32:14.847 --> 32:17.213
Delicious. Mm.

32:17.215 --> 32:19.652
Absolutely divine.

32:21.554 --> 32:22.688
Mm!

32:26.091 --> 32:27.691
You're so good.

32:28.995 --> 32:31.361
Oh, God, I miss you. I would've shared.
Oh, you aren't here.

32:31.363 --> 32:34.464
But you know what I mean.
Oh, God. I'm so confused.

32:38.905 --> 32:42.140
Now where's
my little sweety pie.

32:52.183 --> 32:55.153
Come on! We've got
to clear the decks.

32:56.656 --> 32:57.453
Sorry?

32:57.455 --> 33:00.456
Get below
before it's too late.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.492
Darling, if I didn't
like your style,

33:02.494 --> 33:04.628
you'd be a plate
of donuts by now.

33:04.630 --> 33:08.097
But you must realize
this is my party,

33:08.099 --> 33:11.269
and nobody leaves
until I say so.

33:14.472 --> 33:15.573
Let's go below.

33:18.978 --> 33:19.845
Oh!

33:21.546 --> 33:22.582
Oh!

33:24.516 --> 33:27.853
Fear not, my sweet.
Daddy will look after you.

33:42.969 --> 33:45.170
Felix, show some guts.

33:45.570 --> 33:47.671
If...

33:47.673 --> 33:50.141
You insist.

33:54.145 --> 33:56.279
Bit tastelessness and, uh...

33:56.281 --> 33:58.916
Yeah, not very filling.

33:58.918 --> 34:00.820
All it needs is some sugar...

34:01.453 --> 34:03.154
Whoa!

34:05.758 --> 34:07.657
Help!

34:07.659 --> 34:08.728
Help.

34:12.630 --> 34:14.232
Help!

34:17.235 --> 34:18.737
Man overboard.

34:20.873 --> 34:24.540
Cucaracha Caputo.

34:24.542 --> 34:25.510
Help.

34:30.514 --> 34:32.382
Hold on, Mr. Cucaracha.

34:39.456 --> 34:40.723
Help!

34:40.725 --> 34:41.860
Help.

34:42.795 --> 34:45.328
Don't worry. Daddy's here.

34:45.330 --> 34:46.996
We're going to drown.

34:46.998 --> 34:48.098
Aah!

34:48.100 --> 34:51.234
I can't keep
the water out much longer.

34:52.203 --> 34:54.203
Calm down, everyone.

34:54.205 --> 34:56.774
There is nothing
to be scared of.

34:56.775 --> 34:59.175
How do you know that,
Queen Annabelle?

34:59.177 --> 35:00.878
I mean, how do you know?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.882
I just know, all right?

35:25.104 --> 35:28.471
Hey, hey! We did it!

35:28.473 --> 35:32.976
See? I told you there was
nothing to be scared of.

35:32.978 --> 35:35.213
Right as always, my dear.

35:36.182 --> 35:38.148
Come on now. Eat up.

35:38.150 --> 35:40.249
Oh, I'm starving.

35:40.251 --> 35:43.621
- Who said that?
- It's me. Eliza.

35:45.157 --> 35:47.457
Just look at you, girl.

35:47.459 --> 35:51.964
I'm tired, I'm cold.
And I'm starving.

35:52.797 --> 35:54.466
And you're fat.

35:55.366 --> 35:58.468
Fat as a pregnant pig.

35:58.470 --> 36:02.574
Can I just have
one little donut, please?

36:04.743 --> 36:07.010
You know how much
I love you, don't you?

36:07.012 --> 36:10.114
Yes, I suppose so.

36:10.116 --> 36:12.915
That's why you can't
have any donuts.

36:12.917 --> 36:14.851
It's for your own good.

36:14.853 --> 36:15.885
Just one.

36:15.887 --> 36:19.123
If I get any thinner,
the water will come in.

36:19.125 --> 36:20.960
The answer is still no.

36:22.027 --> 36:24.696
One day,
you'll thank me for it.

36:26.966 --> 36:28.098
Mm.

36:33.438 --> 36:35.607
That was a close call.

36:36.474 --> 36:40.777
<i>Capitano, terrible accidente.</i>

36:40.779 --> 36:44.847
The magical fog machine
<i>e distrutta.</i>

36:44.849 --> 36:46.516
Magic fog machine?

36:46.518 --> 36:48.384
Is that what
made this happen?

36:48.386 --> 36:51.021
My fog machine

36:51.023 --> 36:55.291
can do <i>ab-solutamente</i> anything.

36:55.293 --> 36:58.628
Big, fat, tall, small,

36:58.630 --> 37:00.897
but never what you expect.

37:00.899 --> 37:02.365
Can I take a look at it?

37:02.367 --> 37:06.404
<i>Attenzione.</i> Cucaracha Caputo.

37:11.376 --> 37:12.542
What are you doing?

37:12.544 --> 37:14.010
I'm steering the ship.

37:14.012 --> 37:16.213
Well, you need to watch
where you're going.

37:16.215 --> 37:18.248
You almost got us all killed.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.049
No, I didn't.

37:20.051 --> 37:21.686
I saved the ship.

37:29.027 --> 37:32.831
They would have all panicked if I
hadn't shown them I was in charge.

37:35.533 --> 37:37.600
I'll report you, er...

37:37.602 --> 37:40.036
I'll report you
on the hour

37:40.038 --> 37:43.940
to update...
To update you on our course.

37:43.942 --> 37:45.108
You do that.

37:45.110 --> 37:47.277
And no falling asleep
on the job.

37:47.279 --> 37:49.480
Or you'll know
what'll happen to you.

38:25.583 --> 38:30.688
You'll never get off
this terriblo ship.

38:33.524 --> 38:37.927
I devoted my whole life
to this machine,

38:37.929 --> 38:42.632
and what happens
when I need it most?

38:42.634 --> 38:44.002
Kaput!

38:45.237 --> 38:46.537
Let me look.

38:47.839 --> 38:50.575
What's this written
on the side?

38:51.442 --> 38:53.109
It's too dark.

38:53.111 --> 38:54.510
I can't read it.

38:54.512 --> 38:55.980
<i>Attenzione!</i>

39:01.019 --> 39:02.553
Slippers, please.

39:02.820 --> 39:03.855
Felix?

39:04.255 --> 39:05.421
Slippers.

39:05.423 --> 39:07.657
Slippers. At once, my dear.

39:07.659 --> 39:10.893
You're a bit slow on the
uptake this morning, Felix.

39:10.895 --> 39:13.397
Awfully sorry.
Won't happen again.

39:13.399 --> 39:14.764
It better not,

39:14.766 --> 39:17.669
unless you want to end up
as the world's finest donut.

39:21.439 --> 39:22.907
Don't worry, Daddy.

39:23.675 --> 39:25.274
She's always like that.

39:25.276 --> 39:26.711
Ignore her.

39:27.478 --> 39:28.980
You're right, my darling.

39:29.747 --> 39:30.748
Oh my.

39:34.919 --> 39:37.722
Don't worry, Daddy.
It'll be all right.

39:38.756 --> 39:40.556
What's going on out here?

39:40.558 --> 39:43.427
What happened to the
bowing and scraping?

39:43.429 --> 39:45.863
Long live the queen.

39:47.799 --> 39:49.200
And you are?

39:50.436 --> 39:53.302
- Captain...
- No, not you. You.

39:53.304 --> 39:55.372
- Who me?
- Uh...

39:55.374 --> 39:56.872
Exactly.

39:56.874 --> 39:59.809
Peter, firefly extraordinaire.

39:59.811 --> 40:02.011
And sailor of the seven seas.

40:02.013 --> 40:05.147
I'm also a multi-talented baker.
I don't know if you know that.

40:05.149 --> 40:08.751
Shut it. Lamps should
be seen and not heard.

40:08.753 --> 40:12.088
I am Captain Stinger.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.692
And this is my crew.

40:16.995 --> 40:20.196
So, Captain Stinger,

40:20.198 --> 40:23.599
who gave permission for you
and your crew to board my ship?

40:23.601 --> 40:26.402
Well, it wasn't this boy.
He was tied up at the time.

40:29.974 --> 40:34.043
And what brings you
to my modest vessel?

40:34.045 --> 40:37.313
I have a proposal for you,
my dear.

40:37.315 --> 40:39.415
A proposal?

40:39.417 --> 40:40.883
How exciting.

40:40.885 --> 40:43.986
It could make us a lot of money.

40:43.988 --> 40:47.390
You begin to interest me,
Captain Stinger.

40:47.392 --> 40:50.094
More money than
we could ever spend.

40:50.795 --> 40:52.595
Do you dance, Captain?

40:52.597 --> 40:54.799
I thought
you'd never ask.

41:21.159 --> 41:22.291
Mm.

41:26.397 --> 41:29.065
So, what do you say,
Queen Annabelle?

41:29.067 --> 41:31.069
I'm thinking about it.

41:32.770 --> 41:36.138
What you need
on this ship is a Captain.

41:36.140 --> 41:37.540
Yes.

41:37.542 --> 41:40.409
One who doesn't
fall asleep at the wheel.

41:40.411 --> 41:44.547
You would never do that,
would you, Captain Stinger?

41:44.549 --> 41:48.350
No, I have a lamp
to keep me awake.

41:48.352 --> 41:49.819
One hundred percent
guaranteed.

41:49.821 --> 41:52.421
Multifunctional,
water and shock-proof,

41:52.423 --> 41:54.256
guaranteed for ten meters
below sea level,

41:54.258 --> 41:56.659
rust-proof and I have
an excellent five-year warranty.

41:56.661 --> 41:58.961
- Shut it, lamp.
- Ow!

41:58.963 --> 42:03.165
Perhaps you should give me
something as a token of goodwill.

42:03.167 --> 42:05.770
Your wish is my command.

42:06.504 --> 42:08.971
Be brave, young man.

42:08.973 --> 42:12.775
Yours is a heroic sacrifice.

42:12.777 --> 42:14.078
Aye, aye, Captain.

42:19.584 --> 42:23.219
It's a pleasure
working with you, Captain Stinger.

42:23.221 --> 42:26.991
Let this be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

42:28.860 --> 42:29.892
There.

42:29.894 --> 42:33.028
That's where the treasure is.

42:33.030 --> 42:35.331
That's just water.

42:35.333 --> 42:37.166
No, my dear. It's tea.

42:37.168 --> 42:40.736
One spoon per person,
and one for pot.

42:40.738 --> 42:42.505
Here you are, Captain.

42:42.507 --> 42:45.541
The treasure's
on the sea bed.

42:45.543 --> 42:47.845
Seven fathoms down.

42:48.446 --> 42:50.079
So, how do we get it?

42:50.081 --> 42:51.983
Just wait and see.

42:52.450 --> 42:54.150
Oh.

42:54.152 --> 42:56.888
Oh, no problem. I'm fine.

42:57.822 --> 43:00.892
- A donut, Captain?
- Thank you.

43:03.361 --> 43:04.728
Any good?

43:05.062 --> 43:07.165
Delicious.

43:07.965 --> 43:09.865
Can you give me the recipe?

43:09.867 --> 43:11.967
Did you bring me a donut?

43:11.969 --> 43:16.138
Trust me, you don't want
any of those donuts.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.040
I need some food.

43:18.042 --> 43:21.977
If I get any thinner,
the water will come in.

43:21.979 --> 43:23.281
This will keep you going.

43:25.682 --> 43:26.884
Thanks.

43:31.956 --> 43:33.889
Is that all you've got?

43:33.891 --> 43:36.992
I can't go on like this forever.

43:36.994 --> 43:40.095
Don't worry, Eliza.
I'll get us out of this.

43:40.097 --> 43:42.331
But how are you
going to do that?

43:42.333 --> 43:43.733
You're just a boy.

43:44.268 --> 43:45.303
Uh...

43:51.542 --> 43:52.877
This is the spot.

43:53.578 --> 43:55.511
Prepare to drop anchor.

43:55.513 --> 43:56.744
Aye, aye, Captain.

43:56.746 --> 43:58.182
Prepare the diver.

43:59.283 --> 44:01.849
But how do we know
that we can trust him?

44:01.851 --> 44:05.921
Felix, I do believe
you're jealous.

44:05.923 --> 44:08.123
I haven't got anything
against him,

44:08.125 --> 44:10.259
but we don't know
anything about him.

44:10.261 --> 44:12.895
And you know what they say
about scorpions.

44:12.897 --> 44:14.563
They can't be trusted.

44:14.565 --> 44:16.367
You worry too much.

44:17.734 --> 44:20.402
Captain Stinger will
make us all rich.

44:20.404 --> 44:24.607
One day, you'll look back
on this moment and laugh.

44:24.609 --> 44:27.443
Hmm. Perhaps,
you're right, my dear.

44:27.445 --> 44:29.146
How does that feel?

44:29.779 --> 44:31.915
But I can't swim!

44:32.583 --> 44:33.983
Just as well.

44:33.985 --> 44:36.452
That way, you can't escape.

45:26.604 --> 45:28.637
Let me give you some advice.

45:28.639 --> 45:32.576
For nothing, don't try and move.

45:33.377 --> 45:35.413
Just stay where you are.

45:36.447 --> 45:38.149
Do we have a choice?

45:38.616 --> 45:41.250
Actually, no.

45:41.252 --> 45:43.851
You see, 100%
of the treasure

45:43.853 --> 45:46.590
sounds better
than a measly 50%.

45:48.892 --> 45:51.093
Make sure it'll hold.

45:51.095 --> 45:54.465
Wouldn't want anyone
to lose their balance.

45:55.166 --> 45:57.566
Time for a swimming lesson.

45:57.568 --> 46:00.736
Yeah. Exercise is the secret
of a healthy heart.

46:00.738 --> 46:04.442
Don't worry, my little gooey-goo.
It'll be all right.

46:27.798 --> 46:31.533
Get him out of that suit
and toss him overboard.

46:31.535 --> 46:32.636
Thanks for your help.

46:33.304 --> 46:35.004
Bye-bye now.

46:36.106 --> 46:37.040
Get him!

46:41.512 --> 46:42.578
Ooh.

46:42.580 --> 46:43.447
Huh?

46:47.685 --> 46:49.119
Mm!

47:04.000 --> 47:06.303
Is the ship in trouble, Morten?

47:07.137 --> 47:08.604
Pirates, Eliza.

47:08.606 --> 47:10.339
No time to talk.

47:10.341 --> 47:11.306
Be careful.

47:11.308 --> 47:14.311
By the way, Eliza,
I'm not just a boy.

47:16.347 --> 47:17.448
I'm a Captain.

47:18.148 --> 47:19.983
And this is my ship.

47:37.167 --> 47:38.335
Yes.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.974
And my mother told me
there was no money in piracy.

47:48.278 --> 47:50.278
Mothers just want
their children to be successful.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.748
My mother
wanted me to shine,

47:52.750 --> 47:54.015
not as a lamp.

47:58.622 --> 47:59.588
Aah!

47:59.590 --> 48:00.491
Huh?

48:01.725 --> 48:02.626
Oh!

48:04.862 --> 48:05.894
Huh?

48:27.083 --> 48:28.652
- Gotcha.
- Look out!

48:31.287 --> 48:32.456
Whoa.

48:54.377 --> 48:57.111
Too bad about
your treasure, Captain.

48:57.113 --> 48:59.583
Looks like you'll
never see it now.

49:11.394 --> 49:14.763
I couldn't let you
leave with nothing.

49:14.765 --> 49:16.297
Just a little something

49:16.299 --> 49:19.435
to help you back
on the straightened narrow.

49:23.674 --> 49:29.076
Queen Annabelle,
I think you should reconsider.

49:29.078 --> 49:31.479
Yes. Perhaps,
you're right.

49:31.481 --> 49:34.716
You're such a strong,
handsome Captain.

49:34.718 --> 49:37.853
And we dance
so well together.

49:37.855 --> 49:42.024
But then again, you betrayed
my trust and took over my ship.

49:42.026 --> 49:44.826
You've got to look
at the big picture.

49:44.828 --> 49:47.563
I kept the ship safe.

49:49.132 --> 49:51.633
But you see,
I already have a Captain.

49:51.635 --> 49:54.402
- A very brave one.
- Ah!

49:54.404 --> 49:57.204
And they say you should
never trust a scorpion

49:57.206 --> 50:00.644
no matter how well
he can dance the tango.

50:01.210 --> 50:03.112
Aah. Aah.

50:05.481 --> 50:06.650
Aah!

50:07.150 --> 50:08.750
But I can't swim.

50:08.752 --> 50:10.384
And I'm allergic to water.

50:10.386 --> 50:12.688
I might even catch a cold.

50:12.690 --> 50:15.057
Help! Peter!

50:15.059 --> 50:17.659
At last, he got it right.

50:17.661 --> 50:19.061
My name's Peter.

50:19.063 --> 50:22.131
And I'm a firefly,
not a lamp.

50:25.234 --> 50:27.604
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

50:28.639 --> 50:31.274
Yay! Hurray!

50:39.248 --> 50:41.215
I know what
you're all thinking.

50:41.217 --> 50:44.454
Your Queen has
saved you once again.

50:45.121 --> 50:47.188
All hail the queen.

50:47.190 --> 50:49.292
Long may she reign.

50:50.728 --> 50:53.229
Long live the queen.

50:55.099 --> 50:58.601
All kneel
for Her Majesty the queen.

51:00.004 --> 51:02.070
Stop sniveling.

51:02.072 --> 51:04.106
What I need now is a Captain.

51:04.108 --> 51:07.243
And I know
the perfect candidate.

51:07.978 --> 51:09.612
- Tilda.
- What?

51:10.948 --> 51:12.281
Who me?

51:13.951 --> 51:16.283
- But...
- But what, Tilda?

51:16.285 --> 51:18.352
Are you doubting my judgment?

51:18.354 --> 51:20.122
But I have no skills.

51:20.124 --> 51:24.725
No education, no hobbies,
no manners...

51:24.727 --> 51:30.299
But I suppose the queen
knows what she's doing.

51:36.205 --> 51:38.305
We need a proper Captain.

51:38.307 --> 51:40.641
There's danger all around us.

51:40.643 --> 51:44.547
Felix, show this boy
to the crow's nest.

51:49.153 --> 51:51.218
Just look after that flag.

51:51.220 --> 51:54.724
Can you do that for me,
Sweety pie?

52:02.498 --> 52:06.837
Anna, I'll just
take a little walk.

52:13.609 --> 52:14.577
Oh.

52:49.746 --> 52:50.780
Whoa!

53:50.240 --> 53:51.307
Aah!

54:32.114 --> 54:33.416
Phew.

54:34.417 --> 54:36.385
Oh. Oh, Daddy.

54:36.819 --> 54:37.918
There there.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.721
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

54:40.723 --> 54:41.755
- Parson.
- Yes?

54:41.757 --> 54:44.058
Jump off to that mast
and untie that line.

54:44.060 --> 54:44.927
Me?

54:45.862 --> 54:48.497
Oh. Aye, aye, Captain.

54:49.432 --> 54:51.567
Zig, untie the other end.

54:52.202 --> 54:53.734
Aye, aye, Captain.

54:53.736 --> 54:55.203
Tilda.

54:55.205 --> 54:57.573
Hmm... Make yourself useful.

54:58.242 --> 55:00.407
Aye, aye, Captain.

55:00.409 --> 55:04.011
Just a minute.
I give the orders on this ship.

55:09.852 --> 55:11.619
What's this?

55:11.621 --> 55:16.023
The symbol of your power,
Your Magnificent Majesty.

55:16.025 --> 55:18.058
The crown of crowns.

55:18.060 --> 55:22.364
Can't turn my back for two minutes
without some sort of disaster.

55:22.366 --> 55:25.267
Tilda, you were
responsible for the ship.

55:25.269 --> 55:28.370
In theory,
but Zig was the one...

55:28.372 --> 55:30.037
What?

55:30.039 --> 55:35.109
I was doing just fine
until that boy there interfered.

55:35.111 --> 55:37.013
- Morten!
- Hmm?

55:43.353 --> 55:46.587
You stand accused
of the crimes of piracy

55:46.589 --> 55:47.988
on the seven seas.

55:47.990 --> 55:51.091
Mutiny and gross
dereliction of duty,

55:51.093 --> 55:54.730
endangering the safety of
other members of the crew,

55:55.698 --> 55:58.601
deserting your post
on the crow's nest,

55:59.969 --> 56:02.236
in addition to which,
you stand accused

56:02.238 --> 56:07.443
of vandalizing our cultural
heritage, and defiling the flag.

56:08.978 --> 56:13.647
We hereby sentence
the accused, Morten Viks,

56:13.649 --> 56:18.688
to be transformed into a plate
of the world's finest donuts.

56:18.921 --> 56:20.422
Mm.

56:20.424 --> 56:22.856
You may proceed.

56:22.858 --> 56:26.228
<i>Oui, madame.</i> I shall proceed.

56:31.701 --> 56:33.602
What do you think you're doing?

56:34.170 --> 56:35.903
I'm the Captain.

56:35.905 --> 56:36.770
Help!

56:36.772 --> 56:39.175
- Help!
- I'm coming.

56:43.312 --> 56:44.747
Help!

56:54.523 --> 56:56.492
That's beautiful.

57:02.365 --> 57:03.232
No!

57:06.302 --> 57:07.603
Oh. Ugh.

57:09.505 --> 57:11.007
Hold on.

57:11.441 --> 57:13.175
Stop!

57:20.616 --> 57:22.484
Hold on tight.

57:22.486 --> 57:24.220
Whoa! Whoa!

57:29.158 --> 57:30.793
Morten!

57:32.595 --> 57:34.630
Help!

57:35.499 --> 57:37.031
Help.

57:37.033 --> 57:38.667
Huh?

57:39.201 --> 57:41.937
Help! Help!

57:46.042 --> 57:47.109
Come on.

57:54.183 --> 57:55.684
Oh.

58:06.328 --> 58:08.130
What's this suitcase
doing here?

58:19.508 --> 58:21.275
Thanks for saving me, Eliza,

58:21.277 --> 58:22.976
but I have to go back.

58:22.978 --> 58:24.211
You can't.

58:24.213 --> 58:25.946
It's too dangerous.

58:25.948 --> 58:29.016
The ship will sink.
I have to.

58:29.018 --> 58:31.718
It's all right.
I blocked up the hole.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.253
That's great, Eliza.

58:33.255 --> 58:34.788
What did you block it with?

58:34.790 --> 58:36.258
Some of the cargo.

58:36.725 --> 58:38.559
- Sugar?
- Yes.

58:38.561 --> 58:40.494
Then we must go back.

58:40.496 --> 58:42.396
Sugar dissolves in water.

58:42.398 --> 58:44.700
- But you must...
- Oh!

59:00.015 --> 59:01.315
Where are we?

59:01.317 --> 59:03.319
No place for a butterfly.

59:06.822 --> 59:08.157
Hmm.

59:09.358 --> 59:10.926
That's Dad's ship.

59:14.530 --> 59:16.866
Mm. Let's see.

59:19.902 --> 59:22.371
Here we are, my beauty.

59:26.542 --> 59:28.177
Help! Let me go.

59:29.011 --> 59:30.310
Morten!

59:30.312 --> 59:32.412
This won't hurt a bit.

59:32.414 --> 59:33.949
Aah!

59:41.023 --> 59:42.224
Aah!

59:42.791 --> 59:44.093
Come on.

59:48.464 --> 59:50.900
Where are you, my beauty?

59:56.105 --> 59:57.771
Come on now.

59:57.773 --> 01:00:00.675
You can't hide
from me forever.

01:00:03.612 --> 01:00:05.114
Come on!

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:20.460
I see your home lacks a certain
feminine touch, Mr. Stinger.

01:00:20.462 --> 01:00:23.163
Yes, I'm sorry
about the mess, my love.

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:25.199
I've been working
on my collection.

01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:28.701
It contains some
rather interesting objects.

01:00:28.703 --> 01:00:31.605
Like this ship's model,
for example.

01:00:31.607 --> 01:00:32.738
Exactly.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.142
This model proves
once and for all

01:00:35.144 --> 01:00:40.080
that the <i>Salamander</i> once belonged
to my ancestor, one-eyed pirate.

01:00:40.082 --> 01:00:44.518
Oh. Now I understand your
interest in buying that old...

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.121
I mean...
It's a beautiful ship.

01:00:48.123 --> 01:00:51.291
It must have
great sentimental value.

01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:56.129
It means as much to me as
the ballet dance to you, my queen.

01:00:56.131 --> 01:01:00.400
There's some fine wood in that ship.
I think I'll have it dismantled.

01:01:00.402 --> 01:01:02.369
We've got to stop him Eliza.

01:01:02.371 --> 01:01:07.076
And you, my dear,
can concentrate on your ballet.

01:01:07.676 --> 01:01:09.142
Yes, he's evil.

01:01:09.144 --> 01:01:12.481
What a kind man
you are, Mr. Stinger.

01:01:13.015 --> 01:01:14.381
Drink.

01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:17.684
Would he really pull apart
the <i>Salamander?</i>

01:01:17.686 --> 01:01:19.186
Yes, please.

01:01:19.188 --> 01:01:21.588
With the greatest pleasure.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.257
Cheers.

01:01:23.259 --> 01:01:26.460
What's the matter?
You're not giving up.

01:01:26.462 --> 01:01:28.328
But what can I do.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.929
I'm just a little boy.

01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:31.365
No, you're not.

01:01:31.367 --> 01:01:35.170
You're a Captain who
never abandons his ship.

01:01:37.039 --> 01:01:40.307
- All right. Let's give it a go.
- Yes!

01:01:57.593 --> 01:01:58.891
Are you sure now?

01:01:58.893 --> 01:02:01.030
I don't have a choice.

01:02:01.929 --> 01:02:03.399
Then I'll say goodbye.

01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:09.003
We'll see each other again.

01:02:10.606 --> 01:02:11.939
I'm sure.

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:25.421
Hmph.

01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:35.597
Whoa!

01:02:40.402 --> 01:02:41.570
Whoa.

01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:48.709
If the water raises anymore,

01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:51.347
it'll squash us
against the ceiling.

01:02:52.781 --> 01:02:55.114
Aah! Where's Morten?

01:02:55.116 --> 01:02:56.717
He'd know what to do.

01:02:56.719 --> 01:02:58.520
Oh, God. Where is he?
Where is he?

01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:06.092
Now, Felix,
show some guts.

01:03:06.094 --> 01:03:09.262
If you insist.

01:03:14.737 --> 01:03:16.205
Come on.

01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:18.739
Stupida machina.

01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:21.140
Can't even make
a little radish talk.

01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:23.477
Mr. Cucaracha.

01:03:23.479 --> 01:03:26.912
Ah. It's you, <i>mio amico.</i>

01:03:26.914 --> 01:03:30.015
Machine non-function.

01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:32.954
Not make radish talk.

01:03:39.495 --> 01:03:40.928
Here you go.

01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:45.866
What's that written
on the side?

01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:48.901
"Warning: Keep out
of reach of people

01:03:48.903 --> 01:03:50.970
"who don't know
what they are doing."

01:03:50.972 --> 01:03:53.040
That's strange.
Let me try.

01:04:01.617 --> 01:04:04.684
Daddy, I'm hungry, Daddy.

01:04:04.686 --> 01:04:06.688
It works. It works!

01:04:07.423 --> 01:04:10.055
<i>E un miracolo.</i>

01:04:10.057 --> 01:04:14.160
<i>Machina functiona!</i>

01:04:14.162 --> 01:04:16.996
See, you just need to know
what you're doing.

01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:19.666
- Give it to me.
- No, I need it.

01:04:19.668 --> 01:04:22.302
Give it to me!

01:04:22.304 --> 01:04:27.376
Give it to me!

01:04:27.942 --> 01:04:29.411
I'm starving here.

01:04:31.613 --> 01:04:33.582
Hello, Sweety pie.

01:04:34.282 --> 01:04:35.283
Huh?

01:04:36.518 --> 01:04:39.253
Or is it, "Goodbye"?

01:04:42.758 --> 01:04:43.956
Huh?

01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:46.361
Uh-oh.

01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:10.284
Oh. Looks like it's just
you and me now.

01:05:14.288 --> 01:05:17.389
Let me go. This is treason.

01:05:17.391 --> 01:05:20.092
Get me out of here
right this instance,

01:05:20.094 --> 01:05:22.330
or you'll all end up as donuts.

01:05:22.997 --> 01:05:24.700
Felix!

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:26.367
Mm.

01:05:29.671 --> 01:05:30.539
Huh?

01:05:35.777 --> 01:05:37.245
Hold on tight.

01:05:41.783 --> 01:05:44.318
- Parson.
- Me?

01:05:46.788 --> 01:05:48.955
Get us to the crow's nest fast.

01:05:48.957 --> 01:05:51.493
Come on, Daddy,
show some guts.

01:05:53.595 --> 01:05:54.730
If you insist.

01:05:58.199 --> 01:06:02.136
Parson grasshopper Felix
at your service, Captain Morten.

01:06:17.986 --> 01:06:20.352
I'm starving.

01:06:20.354 --> 01:06:24.793
I could just die
for a nice donut.

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:27.528
Whoa. Whoa.

01:06:29.631 --> 01:06:30.498
Felix!

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.836
Felix! Whoa!

01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:29.121
See? I told you
we'd meet again.

01:07:29.123 --> 01:07:30.524
Sorry?

01:07:30.859 --> 01:07:32.058
Morten.

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.562
I know. I'm sorry about before.

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:36.664
I didn't realize.

01:07:37.899 --> 01:07:40.100
I've got something
to say to you.

01:07:40.102 --> 01:07:42.167
Yes, me too.

01:07:42.169 --> 01:07:44.070
I feel the same way.

01:07:44.072 --> 01:07:46.742
It's your dad. He's here.

01:07:56.118 --> 01:07:57.618
Hmph.

01:07:58.653 --> 01:08:01.121
You can't pay
for your son's upkeep.

01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:02.922
You've got huge debts,

01:08:02.924 --> 01:08:05.391
and your only asset is the ship.

01:08:05.393 --> 01:08:08.193
And no doubt,
you've found a buyer for it.

01:08:08.195 --> 01:08:10.731
Here's what I'm
prepared to pay you.

01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:18.037
This is what you owe Anna,

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.207
plus a small commission
for her trouble.

01:08:22.209 --> 01:08:25.613
See, you come out all right.

01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:30.314
Don't take it!

01:08:30.317 --> 01:08:33.484
He wants to take the <i>Salamander</i>
apart, and sell it

01:08:33.487 --> 01:08:36.823
bit by bit.
And she's in on it.

01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:37.790
That's it.

01:08:37.792 --> 01:08:40.292
- You're grounded.
- Hang on.

01:08:40.294 --> 01:08:42.560
You're after that "pirate gold."

01:08:42.563 --> 01:08:43.932
Pirate gold?

01:08:44.765 --> 01:08:46.331
It... It's a secret.

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:48.767
I am the only one
who knows.

01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:50.602
Do you think so?

01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:53.707
Remember I was telling you
about One-eye, the pirate?

01:08:55.443 --> 01:08:58.111
<i>My great-great-granddad
was there</i>

01:08:58.113 --> 01:09:00.413
<i>when the</i> Salamander
<i>was marooned.</i>

01:09:02.582 --> 01:09:06.385
<i>One-eye was
turned into a crab.</i>

01:09:06.386 --> 01:09:09.488
<i>Before he crawled under a rock,
he was able to say...</i>

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:14.060
The gold is
in the ship's timber.

01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:16.996
<i>Great-great granddad managed
to get off the island.</i>

01:09:16.997 --> 01:09:19.465
<i>He happened to meet
my great-great-grandmother,</i>

01:09:19.466 --> 01:09:22.634
<i>a wonderful lady,
very rich.</i>

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:27.473
<i>She helped him buy the</i> Salamander
<i>from a Shanghai trader.</i>

01:09:27.475 --> 01:09:30.143
And they searched the ship
from bell to stern.

01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:31.578
And?

01:09:32.613 --> 01:09:35.613
Nothing. There wasn't any gold.

01:09:35.616 --> 01:09:37.685
Nice story.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.154
We don't believe
a word of it.

01:09:42.157 --> 01:09:43.721
Hang on a minute.

01:09:43.724 --> 01:09:45.058
I read about One-eye

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.026
in my pirate book.

01:09:47.028 --> 01:09:48.594
He went mad.

01:09:48.595 --> 01:09:52.299
He thought his villa
was really his ship.

01:09:54.035 --> 01:09:55.901
That must be it.

01:09:55.903 --> 01:09:57.469
The gold is in...

01:09:57.471 --> 01:09:59.872
The timbers of your house.

01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:00.974
Must be off.

01:10:00.976 --> 01:10:04.476
Very nice chatting with you.
Come on, Piggy wiggy.

01:10:04.478 --> 01:10:07.780
Will the man with the
golden pen take me with him?

01:10:07.782 --> 01:10:11.784
Yes, come on,
my butterfly queen.

01:10:11.786 --> 01:10:16.055
We'll sell the cafe and
flutter off into the sunset.

01:10:16.057 --> 01:10:17.589
Don't worry about us.

01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:20.761
We're leaving.
It's over between us, Anna.

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:27.666
I'm going to fill you till you
burst my little piggy wiggy.

01:10:27.668 --> 01:10:30.236
She never seems
to have enough.

01:10:30.238 --> 01:10:34.506
Always hungry
for more and more.

01:10:34.508 --> 01:10:37.243
We'll just have
to feed her more.

01:10:37.245 --> 01:10:38.977
Come on, Piggy,

01:10:38.979 --> 01:10:41.682
Let's find that treasure.

01:10:47.488 --> 01:10:49.354
Bunch of ticks.

01:10:49.356 --> 01:10:50.556
There is no treasure.

01:10:50.558 --> 01:10:52.791
But the <i>Salamander's</i>
a treasure.

01:10:52.793 --> 01:10:55.828
Right you are, Captain Morten.
Right you are.

01:11:25.726 --> 01:11:26.727
Whoa.

01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:32.931
Prepare to cast off.

01:11:32.933 --> 01:11:34.535
Aye, aye, Captain Morten.

01:11:37.037 --> 01:11:38.606
- Wait for me.
- Huh?

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.475
I'm coming with you.

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:44.142
Can she come on board?

01:11:44.144 --> 01:11:48.614
You're the Captain, it's our ship.
We can do what we want.

01:11:48.616 --> 01:11:50.818
We don't supposed you have
much family left.

01:11:53.554 --> 01:11:55.288
You can join us too.

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:58.759
We are always in need of able
sea-men, haven't we, Captain?

01:12:01.662 --> 01:12:03.229
No, we better hang...

01:12:03.231 --> 01:12:06.031
You know, we better go.
You know, Mr. Stinger will be waiting.

01:12:06.033 --> 01:12:09.768
Yeah. We don't wanna keep
Mr. Stinger waiting. Sorry.

01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:12.104
Soon, you'll have
a golden hand

01:12:12.106 --> 01:12:16.376
with diamond nails
on every finger, my darling.

01:12:16.378 --> 01:12:18.412
Thank you, my dear.

01:12:19.179 --> 01:12:21.813
Hey! No sleeping
on the job.

01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:25.417
You'd better find that gold,
or you'll be sacked.

01:12:25.419 --> 01:12:28.020
But we can't find anything.

01:12:28.022 --> 01:12:30.323
Gold fever.

01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:31.492
Ticks.

01:12:43.737 --> 01:12:45.105
Oh, look.

01:12:47.675 --> 01:12:50.644
Look, Dad. These nails
are made of gold.

01:12:51.245 --> 01:12:52.813
Well, look at that.

01:12:56.384 --> 01:12:58.583
So there really is a treasure.

01:12:58.585 --> 01:13:00.621
And it's holding
the ship together.

01:13:04.024 --> 01:13:05.225
What are we gonna do?

01:13:10.197 --> 01:13:11.732
Put it back.

01:13:13.067 --> 01:13:14.535
That's my boy.

01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:17.336
Can we set sail now?

01:13:17.338 --> 01:13:19.571
Anchors away, Captain Morten.

01:13:19.573 --> 01:13:21.573
Full steam ahead!
