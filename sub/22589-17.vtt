00:10.470 --> 00:16.726
<i>NARRATOR". A glorious day for the annual
luncheon of the Gotham City Charity Fund.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:25.026
Uh-oh. There's trouble on the wing.

00:26.069 --> 00:29.280
- Wait for me.
- Help! Help!

00:29.864 --> 00:33.159
I'm being hijacked by Harry Hooligan!

00:33.326 --> 00:35.954
Please, won't somebody help me?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.122
Foul play in our fair city.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.792
That crooked quack is up to no good.

00:40.959 --> 00:43.253
Citizen Penguin to the rescue.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.798
You foul filcher. A feint.

00:46.965 --> 00:49.926
I'll teach you to prey
on helpless Gothamites.

00:50.802 --> 00:53.972
Penguin, what's going on here?
It's me you should be slugging.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.891
What? Citizen Penguin
molest a minion of the law?

00:57.058 --> 00:59.477
That is inconceivable.

00:59.644 --> 01:01.563
Take care of this poor old man.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.320
The Penguin did what?

01:09.487 --> 01:12.991
Floored a thug
who was holding up a blind news dealer?

01:13.491 --> 01:16.786
Was polite to a police officer?

01:17.287 --> 01:20.832
Saved a baby in a buggy
from being hit by a truck?

01:22.542 --> 01:28.172
And then donated $100,000
to the Gotham City Charity Fund?

01:28.339 --> 01:32.135
You're absolutely sure it was the Penguin?

01:34.220 --> 01:38.057
All right, Simms. Keep an eye on him.

01:40.685 --> 01:44.522
- Did you hear all that, chief?
-That I did, commissioner.

01:44.689 --> 01:50.695
Oh, that feathered fiend must be cooking up
something pretty foul in his bubbling caldron.

01:50.862 --> 01:56.409
There's only one man capable
of unraveling this tangled skein.

02:03.166 --> 02:09.505
Hark, is this a dagger which I see before me,
the handle toward my hand?

02:09.672 --> 02:12.467
Come, let me clutch thee.

02:12.634 --> 02:15.887
I have thee not, yet I see thee still.

02:16.054 --> 02:18.931
It's very nice that you're playing the lead
in <i>Macbeth,</i> Dick...

02:19.098 --> 02:21.893
...but don't forget
that you have a civics exam coming up.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.520
- Yeah.
-Besides, Alfred may be getting uncomfortable.

02:24.687 --> 02:28.566
Oh, not at all, sir.
I've always had a fondness for Shakespeare.

02:33.863 --> 02:36.032
One moment, sir.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.326
Yes, commissioner?

02:39.243 --> 02:41.746
I see. We'll be right down.

02:41.913 --> 02:44.916
Civics will have to wait, Dick.
Penguin is up to some new tricks.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.586
Alfred, you may exercise your familiarity
with the Bard.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.016
Did you hear those rumors in the lobby?
The Penguin running for mayor.

04:25.183 --> 04:27.977
-It's a free country, Robin.
-It won't be if he's elected.

04:28.144 --> 04:31.689
Besides, I thought convicted felons
were barred from holding any official office.

04:31.856 --> 04:34.942
I suspect Penguin has done
his civics homework well, Robin...

04:35.109 --> 04:38.029
...and has discovered
that Paragraph 34-A of the city charter...

04:38.196 --> 04:39.947
...has never been officially repealed.

04:40.114 --> 04:44.660
It specifically allows convicted criminals
to run for public office.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.871
Holy disaster area.

04:47.038 --> 04:50.708
I don't think there's any danger
of the Penguin being elected, Robin.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.084
<i>Hmm.</i>

04:52.251 --> 04:57.381
The people of Gotham City
are not as simpleminded as he might think.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.009
Thirteen, please.

05:17.693 --> 05:22.448
I'm glad you two are here, Dynamic Duo.
I wanted a chance to say goodbye.

05:22.615 --> 05:26.410
I think you tend to overestimate the Penguin,
Mayor Linseed.

05:26.577 --> 05:30.206
The Gotham City News Dealers' Association
doesn't overestimate him.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.582
They endorsed him.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.585
Thanks to those shenanigans he pulled
this afternoon.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.004
The same shenanigans
got him the endorsement...

05:37.171 --> 05:39.090
...from the Gotham City Charity Fund.

05:39.257 --> 05:43.094
Not to mention
the East Coast Bird Lovers' Society.

05:43.261 --> 05:45.388
- Commissioner?
-Yeah.

05:45.555 --> 05:46.597
Bonnie.

05:46.764 --> 05:50.351
Send in Gallus, Rooper and Trendek.

05:58.651 --> 06:01.529
Gallus, Rooper, Trendek.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.449
- Take it away, C.F.
-Thank you, E.G.

06:05.616 --> 06:09.579
Now, this is an accurate depiction
of the Gotham City electorate...

06:09.745 --> 06:12.665
...as determined
by our famous random sampling method.

06:12.832 --> 06:15.710
Result, 30 percent
stated their preference for Mayor Linseed.

06:15.877 --> 06:19.797
- Sixty percent preferred the Penguin.
-And 7 percent were undecided.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.216
What's the fourth line of the chart?

06:22.383 --> 06:25.052
Ah, yes. That represents two old ladies...

06:25.219 --> 06:28.097
...who are backing Harry Goldwinner,
the monarchist candidate.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.933
And that, gentlemen, is the big picture.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.771
Now, if you'll excuse us, we have
an appointment with the other candidate.

06:47.867 --> 06:50.953
Gallus, Rooper, Trendek.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.831
They're never wrong.

06:53.998 --> 06:57.168
It's hopeless.
I can't possibly beat the Penguin.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.921
He'll use every underhanded political trick
in the book.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.424
And he probably knows
more underhanded tricks than even I know.

07:03.591 --> 07:07.595
It is true that the Penguin is somewhat devious
in his methods, but--

07:07.762 --> 07:11.724
No, Batman. I don't have a chance.

07:11.891 --> 07:14.936
- There's only one hope.
-Yes?

07:15.519 --> 07:16.771
You, Batman.

07:16.938 --> 07:20.691
- Me?
- Yes, Batman, you.

07:20.858 --> 07:25.363
You're the only one popular enough
to stand a chance of beating that tricky bird.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.948
The mayor is right, Batman.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.992
The Penguin will try to smear
whoever runs against him.

07:30.159 --> 07:33.371
You're the only man in Gotham City
whose reputation is spotless enough...

07:33.537 --> 07:34.956
...to stand up against him.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.041
You've got to run, Batman.

07:37.208 --> 07:40.711
I can run as deputy mayor
on the same ticket with you.

07:40.878 --> 07:46.467
It's the only way we can save Gotham City
from the clutches of that feathered fiend.

07:48.928 --> 07:55.601
To run for mayor
of a great American city like this one...

07:56.602 --> 07:58.896
It's a great responsibility...

07:59.063 --> 08:01.399
...but am I worthy of it?

08:01.565 --> 08:03.401
If you're not, nobody is, Batman.

08:03.901 --> 08:07.613
Guardian of the people's trust...

08:09.073 --> 08:11.993
No, no, I'm not worthy of it.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.413
You're the only man in Gotham City who is,
Batman.

08:15.579 --> 08:19.583
- You've got to accept, Batman.
-We're the representatives of the people.

08:19.750 --> 08:25.172
And we call upon you to save Gotham City
from the horrible fate of the Penguin as mayor.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.216
Very well.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.094
I accept the call of the people.

08:30.261 --> 08:33.597
Hooray for Batman! Batman for mayor!

08:33.764 --> 08:36.933
- Hooray! Hooray!
-Hooray! Ha, ha!

08:39.562 --> 08:44.150
<i>NARRATOR". Not far away,
at Penguin Campaign Headquarters...</i>

08:54.618 --> 08:58.456
Hey, Penguin, vote for him.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.630
All together!

09:06.797 --> 09:09.759
<i>For he's</i> a <i>jolly good Penguin</i>

09:09.925 --> 09:12.136
<i>For he's a jolly good Penguin</i>

09:12.303 --> 09:15.014
<i>For he's a jolly good Penguin</i>

09:15.181 --> 09:17.475
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

09:18.851 --> 09:21.228
All right, back to work, everybody.

09:21.395 --> 09:25.524
When we're through with this campaign,
even Mayor Linseed will vote for me.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.821
Gee, I wish I was old enough to vote for you,
Mr. Penguin.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.158
Don't worry, little one,
you'll get your chance on my fourth term.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.998
Quick, the latest figures.
How much of a lead do I have in the polls?

09:41.165 --> 09:42.917
- None.
-None?

09:43.084 --> 09:44.543
Well, just three hours ago...

09:44.710 --> 09:48.005
...you told me that I had 60 percent
of the electorate.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.801
- That was a pre-Batman poll.
-Since Batman announced his candidacy...

09:51.967 --> 09:55.513
- Fifty-five percent favor Batman.
Thirty-five percent favor the Penguin.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.139
Seven percent are undecided.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.643
And 3 percent are still backing
Harry Goldwinner, the monarchist candidate.

10:00.810 --> 10:05.022
So old Pointy Ears has thrown his cowl
into the ring, huh?

10:05.189 --> 10:10.361
Good. Once and for all,
I'll settle matters with that masked moron.

10:10.528 --> 10:12.321
And when I finish with him...

10:12.488 --> 10:16.033
...he won't garner enough votes
to be elected dogcatcher.

10:18.953 --> 10:22.957
Hold it. All workers double the assessments.

10:23.124 --> 10:25.042
Triple the size of the posters.

10:25.209 --> 10:28.337
Quadruple the number of campaign buttons.

10:28.504 --> 10:33.676
We'll give the voters of this city
the kind of campaign that they want.

10:33.843 --> 10:38.597
Plenty of girls and bands and slogans
and lots of hoopla.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.475
But remember, no politics.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.186
Issues confuse people.

10:44.353 --> 10:49.400
See, a big smile, hearty handshake,
a very catchy campaign song.

10:49.567 --> 10:52.778
That's the way to win an election.
Quack, quack, quack.

11:00.161 --> 11:03.622
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile,
at Batman Campaign Headquarters...</i>

11:03.789 --> 11:06.584
Don't you think we should make them
a little bigger, Batman?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.378
I think these are quite large enough, Robin.

11:09.545 --> 11:14.091
After all, the voters are interested in issues,
not in window dressing.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.844
Sure, Batman, but a little showmanship
wouldn't hurt us any.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.345
No, Robin.

11:18.512 --> 11:22.308
I wanna conduct a campaign
that deals with the issues.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.895
I'm convinced the American electorate
is too mature...

11:26.061 --> 11:29.523
...to be taken in by cheap vaudeville trickery.

11:29.690 --> 11:33.944
After all, if our national leaders were elected
on the basis of tricky slogans...

11:34.111 --> 11:36.113
...brass bands and pretty girls...

11:36.280 --> 11:39.950
...our country would be in a terrible mess,
wouldn't it?

11:44.121 --> 11:50.211
I'm sure you don't remember me, Batman.
I'm Harriet Cooper, Dick Grayson's aunt.

11:50.377 --> 11:54.882
Of course I remember you, Mrs. Cooper.
Welcome to campaign headquarters.

11:55.049 --> 11:58.469
Oh, you always say exactly the right thing.

11:58.636 --> 12:04.350
And I'm sure you're going to do exactly
the right thing for the people of this great city:

12:04.516 --> 12:08.479
win the election
and be an outstanding mayor.

12:08.646 --> 12:11.106
I'm going to try.

12:11.273 --> 12:14.735
The Penguin must be beaten at all costs.

12:14.902 --> 12:19.990
And I know costs run high
in a political campaign.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.410
Perhaps this will help.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.458
Too generous.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.795
Not for such an important cause.

12:32.962 --> 12:36.966
This is just my little way
of taking an interest in politics.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.385
As all good citizens should.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.594
- Thank you.
-Bye.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.096
Bye.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.684
Holy bank balance.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.727
It's because of people like Aunt--

12:48.894 --> 12:52.231
Mrs. Cooper that our cause
must not fail, Robin.

12:52.398 --> 12:53.524
Mm.

12:55.025 --> 12:58.696
<i>NARRATOR".
And so the campaign begins.</i>

13:16.547 --> 13:19.341
Hey, you, that's against the law.

13:25.306 --> 13:28.058
Well, chief,
how does the campaign look to you?

13:28.225 --> 13:30.060
I just don't know, commissioner.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.730
At first I thought Batman was a shoo-in.

13:32.896 --> 13:36.442
But that blasted bird
has put on a fantastic campaign.

13:37.067 --> 13:41.238
There's nowhere in Gotham City
doesn't have one of his ugly posters.

13:41.739 --> 13:44.366
I just don't know, commissioner.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.344
Hi there. How are you?

14:03.510 --> 14:07.097
Hello, Batman. We came down for your rally,
and we're with you all the way.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.893
- Thank you. I appreciate your support.
-We brought our babies for you to kiss.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.563
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
-What?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.774
It's a rather unsanitary habit, you see.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.610
Babies that small are very susceptible
to germs.

14:19.777 --> 14:23.447
- My child, unsanitary?
-That's not what I meant.

14:23.906 --> 14:27.493
A politician that won't kiss babies?
That's outrageous.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.787
I admit it's rather unusual, but--

14:29.953 --> 14:32.915
It's more than unusual.
It's downright suspicious.

14:33.082 --> 14:36.794
It's more than suspicious.
It's downright criminal.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.798
What can you expect from a fake politician
like Batman?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.758
Well, little darling.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.594
Oh, little darling.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.930
There's the little darling.

14:52.101 --> 14:54.144
Where's the other one? Quack, quack.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.481
Let me see the other one. Oh!

14:57.648 --> 15:04.196
How could anyone not love such a sweet,
darling, beautiful child as yours, madam?

15:04.363 --> 15:06.490
Anyone except Batman, that is.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.159
I'm giving him a little kissy-kissy.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.375
Don't tell me you good voters
are going to go to the Batman rally.

15:16.542 --> 15:21.255
I wouldn't go to his rally if you paid me.
The man's a child-hater.

15:21.422 --> 15:26.427
That's right. Down the block and to the right.
The Penguin rally is in full sway.

15:26.593 --> 15:31.974
Count us in.
You can't trust a guy who doesn't like kids.

15:35.519 --> 15:39.440
You slimy snake in the polls.
That was a dirty, low-down trick.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.318
Right you are, Masked Muttonhead.
It's one of my lowest.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.820
Politics is wonderful.

15:44.987 --> 15:49.616
I can use all my lowest, slurpiest tricks,
but now they're legal.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.327
Oh, I should have been a politician
years ago.

15:56.415 --> 15:57.666
Bear in mind, Robin...

15:57.833 --> 16:01.753
...that most politicians
are honest servants of the people.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.048
The dishonest ones are the exception.

16:07.217 --> 16:11.513
As candidate for mayor of Gotham City...

16:11.680 --> 16:14.558
...I hope that this campaign...

16:14.725 --> 16:17.603
...will be a sober discussion...

16:17.769 --> 16:20.189
...of basic issues.

16:20.355 --> 16:26.695
I'm glad to see so many citizens
who are concerned about their city's welfare...

16:26.862 --> 16:28.739
...and interested in its problems.

16:30.449 --> 16:34.453
I wish Batman would put a little more zip
in his speech.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.581
- Chief. Chief.
-Hmm-- Hmm? Huh? Oh.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.333
Sorry, commissioner.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.921
Couldn't you get Batman to agree
to one little brass band?

16:44.087 --> 16:49.009
Batman feels that a political campaign should
not be a vaudeville show, Mayor Linseed.

16:49.176 --> 16:53.597
But this isn't a political campaign.
This is a funeral service.

16:53.764 --> 16:58.769
I know my opponent is having a rally
down the street.

16:58.936 --> 17:03.690
I hope that he too will address himself...

17:03.857 --> 17:05.608
...to basic issues.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.916
Champagne for everybody.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.336
- Hooray for Penguin!
-Hooray for Penguin!

18:06.503 --> 18:08.922
Hooray for me! Quack, quack.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.852
<i>Vote for Penguin, yes, sirree
He's the bird for you and me</i>

18:22.019 --> 18:25.522
<i>Clean up Gotham, one, two, three
So cast your vote for Pengy</i>

18:25.689 --> 18:29.026
<i>Friends and fellow Gothamites
The Penguin platform is simple</i>

18:29.192 --> 18:32.863
<i>Extremism in defense of vice
Moderation in pursuit of virtue</i>

18:51.381 --> 18:56.595
My friends,
the Penguin Party stands for mother...

19:00.223 --> 19:01.308
...country...

19:04.603 --> 19:05.646
...the flag...

19:08.899 --> 19:12.235
It's such a pleasure to hear plain, honest talk
from a candidate...

19:12.402 --> 19:15.113
...instead of the usual
political mumbo jumbo.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.741
--And class!

19:23.372 --> 19:24.915
Holy giveaways, Batman.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.417
No wonder we couldn't get anyone
at our rally.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.170
Penguin was serving free champagne
down the block.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.672
To each his own, Robin.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.007
Penguin depends upon the cynicism
of the people...

19:34.174 --> 19:36.718
...while I depend on their good judgment.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.721
Let's just hope that I'm right.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.641
What's on our agenda
for the rest of the day?

19:42.808 --> 19:47.521
You're scheduled to address two fraternal
orders and a women's garden club.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.939
Which is first?

19:49.314 --> 19:51.775
The Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.361
They called and asked you
to speak to the members.

19:54.528 --> 19:59.282
The Grand Order
of Occidental Nighthawks...

19:59.449 --> 20:04.454
I wonder if there's any particular
significance to that name.

20:04.621 --> 20:08.250
After all, there's more to Penguin's caper
than just running for mayor.

20:08.417 --> 20:12.129
If he wins, he'll bleed Gotham City dry.

20:12.295 --> 20:15.799
The Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.802
Wanna feed it to the Bat Analyzer
and see what we get?

20:18.969 --> 20:21.972
That won't be necessary, Robin.

20:22.806 --> 20:27.144
G-O-O-N.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.996
Welcome, Batman,
to the Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks.

20:46.163 --> 20:49.916
Thank you.
It's always a pleasure to talk to the voters.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.669
Our members can hardly wait.

20:53.336 --> 20:56.673
Those faces look awfully familiar, Batman.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.092
You're right, Robin.

20:59.259 --> 21:04.765
I recognize three of them
from the Gotham City police files.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.018
- I smell a rat.
-Two rats, Boy Wonder.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.437
Can you guess who the cats are?

21:33.794 --> 21:37.130
All right, Batman.
Enough with the fancy umbrella play.

21:40.884 --> 21:45.388
Since you're so eager to discuss
the weighty issues in the campaign, Batman...

21:45.555 --> 21:48.725
...we've fixed up a little surprise for you.

22:29.516 --> 22:33.979
Well, Batman, it looks like
the Penguin put the election on ice, huh?

22:44.239 --> 22:45.949
What's going on here?

22:46.116 --> 22:47.576
This is outrageous.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.454
How dare you threaten the life
of a political candidate?

22:51.621 --> 22:53.790
That's an outrage, I say.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.668
Oh. An outrage.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.629
Look at that. As the ice melts...

22:59.796 --> 23:05.719
...Batman and Robin will sink
lower and lower into this vat.

23:07.387 --> 23:11.474
It's a vat of sulfuric acid. Ooh.
How horrendous.

23:12.058 --> 23:15.937
I intend to summon the police
this very instant.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.986
Uh... Oh, dear me.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.655
I seem to have run out of dimes.

23:25.822 --> 23:26.990
Quack! How tragic.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.451
Well, don't fear, Batman.

23:29.618 --> 23:32.037
I shall run to the police station myself.

23:32.203 --> 23:36.499
If I hurry, I should be there
in three or four hours at the most, hmm?

23:36.666 --> 23:38.877
I am off and running.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.171
Citizen Penguin to the rescue.

23:42.305 --> 23:48.369
