17:28.313 --> 17:31.683
we all know the importance
of a safeword, right? Yeah?

17:31.750 --> 17:35.053
At Midwest State University,
the safeword is "Go, Tigers."

17:35.120 --> 17:37.656
Let me hear you say it.
all: Go, Tigers!

17:37.723 --> 17:39.258
- Anyway, that's just
your starter safeword.

17:39.324 --> 17:40.426
Feel free to change it.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.795
Your safeword
can be anything you want

17:42.861 --> 17:45.197
as long as you realize
you're not actually safe here

17:45.264 --> 17:46.698
or at most colleges.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.200
Gum?
- I wanna go home.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.669
- And I know that y'all know

17:50.736 --> 17:53.806
that you're more likely
to know your attacker,

17:53.872 --> 17:55.441
so maybe
just don't know anyone.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.075
And if you do insist on dating,

17:57.142 --> 17:58.744
I'd find someone who isn't good
at sports

17:58.811 --> 18:01.780
or connected to wealth or power
or friends or parents.

18:01.847 --> 18:02.948
- Okay, cool. What's this?

18:03.015 --> 18:04.483
Like, a list of course
recommendations?

18:04.550 --> 18:06.351
- Oh, yeah,
those are courses to avoid

18:06.418 --> 18:08.887
because the professors
are all ped--

18:08.954 --> 18:11.123
did you gals try the gum yet?

18:11.190 --> 18:13.158
It tastes like Gatorade, right?

18:13.225 --> 18:14.760
- It's so good, yeah.
- So good.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.529
Yeah, it's sugar-free
because your body is a temple,

18:17.596 --> 18:19.331
but also a target.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.133
Look, I know
you're probably like,

18:21.200 --> 18:22.367
"Why do we have to do all this?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.535
"Why can't the school
just teach guys

18:23.602 --> 18:24.870
not to assault?"

18:24.937 --> 18:26.872
[laughs] Sorry, sorry.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.908
"Or hold 'em responsible
when they do?"

18:29.975 --> 18:31.743
[laughs]

18:31.810 --> 18:33.278
[nervous laughter]

18:33.345 --> 18:36.281
I could not get through that
with a straight face.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.116
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna call my mom.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.518
- Ooh, a gift certificate.

18:39.585 --> 18:40.752
- Oh, yeah! Okay.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.120
That is redeemable
for three textbooks

18:42.187 --> 18:45.190
at the bookstore
or a bus ticket

18:45.257 --> 18:47.759
to the closest state
where abortions are legal.

I pitched it to Sascha,
who's still in college,

19:11.850 --> 19:14.152
so it must be
an even bigger bummer to her.

19:14.219 --> 19:16.488
- College orientation
is basically just

19:16.555 --> 19:18.524
"Welcome to college.
You're about to be assaulted."

19:18.590 --> 19:19.992

19:25.697 --> 19:27.900
when I was on an episode
of "30 Rock" he wrote

19:27.966 --> 19:30.736
a million years ago
that I was mostly cut out of.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.671
- Yeah, Amy actually
kind of got herself cut out

19:32.738 --> 19:34.373
because she ad-libbed a lot
of lines,

19:34.439 --> 19:36.341

actually.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.577
But later on,
we became friends,

19:38.644 --> 19:41.380
and I ended up emailing her
these MP3s

19:41.446 --> 19:43.315
of these really kind of, like,
dorky comedy songs

19:43.382 --> 19:44.583
