00:01.767 --> 00:06.124
- We must go faster, Rodney.
- This is pretty much my top gear.

00:12.327 --> 00:14.238
If we make a stand here,
we can take them.

00:14.407 --> 00:17.205
Negative. We don’t know
how many we’re up against.

00:18.607 --> 00:21.121
Rodney, dial the damn gate.
Don’t wait for us.

00:21.327 --> 00:25.240
As if the bullets whizzing past my
head weren’t encouragement enough.

00:27.687 --> 00:30.406
Okay, six, seven.

00:32.327 --> 00:34.477
This is McKay to Atlantis.
We’re coming in hot.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

01:01.287 --> 01:02.959
It’s good to see you again, colonel.

01:05.647 --> 01:07.444
Kolya.

02:14.287 --> 02:15.436
Anything ?

02:15.607 --> 02:17.643
There’s no sign of
Sheppard or our attackers.

02:17.807 --> 02:20.844
- They covered their tracks.
- There’s a chance he was transported.

02:21.007 --> 02:23.316
l’ve gathered the last 50
gate addresses dialed.

02:23.487 --> 02:24.522
That should be helpful.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.281
Since the transmission which
summoned us to the planet...

02:27.447 --> 02:29.642
... was sent using a code we gave
to the Genii...

02:29.807 --> 02:32.526
- ... that will be our starting point.
- What are you gonna do ?

02:32.687 --> 02:34.598
Ask the Genii if one of them took
Sheppard ?

02:34.767 --> 02:36.519
Yes, l am.

02:38.847 --> 02:40.724
- So is this-- ?
- Yes, it is.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.360
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

02:42.527 --> 02:44.643
<i>We’re receiving
the new identification code.</i>

02:44.807 --> 02:48.163
Security teams, stand by.
Lower the shield.

02:53.727 --> 02:55.558
- Welcome, Ladon.
- l came as soon as l--

02:55.767 --> 02:59.316
- What’ve you done with Sheppard ?
- Ronon. He is here as our guest.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.756
How can l help ?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.518
Kolya.

03:10.047 --> 03:13.164
l didn’t kill you last time, remember ?

03:16.167 --> 03:18.203
You promised me points for that.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.005
Kolya.

03:20.207 --> 03:21.640
Damn it.

03:21.807 --> 03:26.597
- l should have killed him.
- You’re wasting your breath.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.323
Didn’t know l had company
down here.

03:30.487 --> 03:32.637
There is no escape.

03:32.807 --> 03:36.595
Yeah, well, prisons are like that.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.201
Never stopped me before.

03:40.247 --> 03:42.124
How long have you been down here ?

03:42.327 --> 03:44.716
Many years.

03:44.887 --> 03:47.082
How many is many ? Five ? Ten ?

03:47.247 --> 03:50.717
- It no longer matters.
- That many ?

03:52.367 --> 03:54.676
What did you do to get here ?

03:54.847 --> 04:00.240
l merely allowed myself
to be captured alive.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.564
Same here.

04:04.687 --> 04:06.405
Look, l got people looking for me.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.842
When they find me,
maybe we can both--

04:21.647 --> 04:23.683
- Move.
- Where are we moving to ?

04:26.007 --> 04:27.725
l kind of like it here.

04:32.207 --> 04:33.765
Commander Kolya insists.

04:34.207 --> 04:38.086
Oh, he insists ?
Well, why didn’t you just say so ?

04:46.047 --> 04:47.560
Pick him up.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.600
l’m sorry this is necessary...

05:03.767 --> 05:06.156
... under the circumstances,
l’m sure you understand.

05:06.367 --> 05:09.165
l came here as a friend, Dr. Weir.
l hope to leave as one.

05:09.367 --> 05:11.756
And we appreciate your concern
for Colonel Sheppard.

05:11.927 --> 05:14.760
Despite that it was your
incompetence that led to his capture.

05:14.927 --> 05:16.963
- Rodney.
- l’m sorry. There is no disputing...

05:17.127 --> 05:18.606
... it was a code we provided...

05:18.807 --> 05:21.844
... that was used to lure us to that
planet where we were ambushed.

05:22.007 --> 05:23.725
Dr. McKay is quite correct.

05:23.887 --> 05:26.685
You entrusted us with codes,
and l allowed them to be stolen.

05:26.847 --> 05:28.883
How and by whom is
an ongoing investigation.

05:29.047 --> 05:31.083
But l must assume it was someone
close to me.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.965
Or this is part of your plans.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.756
Excuse me ?

05:34.967 --> 05:36.798
It would not be the first time.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.798
l say this rhetorically,
since l should think it is obvious...

05:40.967 --> 05:43.083
... but if l were involved
in this in any way...

05:43.247 --> 05:46.159
... or if my intentions were anything
less than honorable...

05:46.327 --> 05:47.919
... would l have come to Atlantis ?

05:48.087 --> 05:49.759
With you, who knows ?
All l know is...

05:49.927 --> 05:53.078
... my friend has been kidnapped
and you had something to do with it.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.404
Which is why l have walked away
from significant responsibilities...

05:56.567 --> 05:59.525
... as leader of my people
to come here and offer our help.

05:59.687 --> 06:01.803
Now you can either let me do that...

06:01.967 --> 06:05.357
... or you can continue to berate me
for my mistake. The choice is yours.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.478
- We have more choices than that.
- Ronon.

06:08.207 --> 06:10.960
l see no reason to stay
if this is how l am to be treated.

06:11.167 --> 06:12.885
Trust me, you’re not going anywhere.

06:13.047 --> 06:16.278
Ronon, l understand how you feel.
Believe me, l do.

06:16.447 --> 06:18.165
But we’re gonna deal
with this my way.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.397
Let’s continue this in my office...

06:24.487 --> 06:25.602
... privately.

06:41.247 --> 06:42.600
It’s been some time.

06:42.807 --> 06:46.038
You must have really missed me
to go through all this trouble.

06:47.047 --> 06:48.639
Nice harpoon, by the way.

06:48.847 --> 06:51.884
To capture an extraordinary soldier
takes extraordinary measures.

06:52.087 --> 06:54.647
- l’Il take that as a compliment.
- As you should.

06:55.807 --> 06:58.321
Just as you should understand
this is not personal.

06:58.487 --> 07:01.479
As soon as my goal is achieved,
you’Il be returned to Atlantis.

07:01.647 --> 07:02.762
That simple ?

07:03.847 --> 07:05.075
What do you want ?

07:06.327 --> 07:08.887
It’s not a question of what l want.

07:09.047 --> 07:11.003
It’s a question of who.

07:12.047 --> 07:13.480
Now, l entrusted the IDC codes
you provided...

07:13.647 --> 07:15.080
... to two men in my government.

07:15.247 --> 07:17.317
My second minister in the event
of my death...

07:17.487 --> 07:19.398
and my personal assistant,
Cassel Massan.

07:19.567 --> 07:21.762
l trust both of these men implicitly...

07:22.167 --> 07:23.316
... or rather, l did.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.283
- Are both men now accounted for ?
- Yes.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.041
They’re in custody. They’re being
questioned as we speak.

07:29.247 --> 07:30.726
Really ?

07:31.567 --> 07:33.478
Don’t underestimate this alliance...

07:33.647 --> 07:35.922
... between our two peoples
to the Genii, Dr. Weir.

07:36.687 --> 07:38.643
When l heard the news,
my first concern--

07:38.807 --> 07:41.480
<i>We have an unscheduled
off-world activation.</i>

07:43.527 --> 07:44.596
Identification code ?

07:44.767 --> 07:47.645
None, but we’re receiving
an analog video signal.

07:47.807 --> 07:49.035
Bring it up.

07:49.687 --> 07:52.963
<i>Dr. Weir, if you’re receiving this,
please respond.</i>

07:55.007 --> 07:56.963
- Who the hell is he ?
- Acastus Kolya.

07:57.167 --> 08:00.477
A Genii military leader who once
tried to seize Atlantis.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.842
Ladon was a member
of his strike team.

08:03.927 --> 08:05.599
<i>I do know you’re there, doctor.</i>

08:05.807 --> 08:08.685
<i>The existence of Atlantis
is no secret among the Genii.</i>

08:10.607 --> 08:12.677
<i>It would be pointless
not to answer.</i>

08:12.887 --> 08:14.798
Open a channel.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.640
This is Dr. Weir.

08:17.847 --> 08:19.644
<i>Oh, good.</i>

08:19.807 --> 08:22.879
<i>I wanted to be certain
you were there to see this.</i>

08:24.967 --> 08:27.162
<i>- What have you done to him ?
-Nothing whatsoever.</i>

08:27.367 --> 08:29.927
Let me rephrase that.
What are you planning to do ?

08:30.127 --> 08:33.005
<i>Oh, it’s quite simple.
I’d like to make a trade.</i>

08:33.207 --> 08:36.404
Before we continue this conversation,
l want to speak with Sheppard.

08:36.727 --> 08:38.046
<i>Be my guest.</i>

08:38.207 --> 08:41.802
We’Il rephrase that too. We would
like him to be able to speak to us.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.605
<i>Very well.</i>

08:48.127 --> 08:52.040
<i>On my command authority,
whatever he asks, don’t do it--</i>

08:52.967 --> 08:55.401
<i>Well, as you can see,
he’s his usual charming self.</i>

08:55.607 --> 08:57.802
Explain your terms, Kolya.

08:59.527 --> 09:03.236
<i>I have heard the familiar voices
of yourself and Dr. mcKay...</i>

09:03.407 --> 09:06.638
<i>... but there is one person I know
is there who has yet to speak.</i>

09:06.807 --> 09:08.604
<i>Ladon Radim is with you, is he not ?</i>

09:10.527 --> 09:12.802
Why would Ladon be here ?

09:13.007 --> 09:15.726
<i>Well, to preserve his precious
alliance with you, doctor.</i>

09:15.887 --> 09:18.526
<i>So that the Genii might remain
in the favor of Atlantis.</i>

09:18.687 --> 09:20.723
<i>my sources have
already confirmed this...</i>

09:20.887 --> 09:23.765
<i>... there’s no point in denying
the fact. Turn him over to me...</i>

09:23.927 --> 09:26.395
<i>... and Colonel Sheppard will be
released immediately.</i>

09:33.487 --> 09:36.047
l’Il need time to consider your offer.

09:36.247 --> 09:39.000
<i>Allow me to help expedite
your decision.</i>

09:45.007 --> 09:46.201
Oh, my God.

09:46.927 --> 09:49.646
<i>Sheppard could have left you
in that hole when we last met.</i>

09:49.807 --> 09:52.765
<i>-He does not deserve this.
- Let’s be clear, Dr. McKay.</i>

09:52.967 --> 09:55.640
<i>- No one does.
-Don’t do this.</i>

09:56.927 --> 09:59.600
<i>-Don’t do it.
- The choice is yours, Dr. Weir.</i>

09:59.767 --> 10:01.803
<i>Do we have an arrangement ?</i>

10:07.447 --> 10:08.436
<i>Very well.</i>

10:18.487 --> 10:21.604
<i>Stop ! Stop !</i>

10:21.767 --> 10:22.916
Enough.

10:35.567 --> 10:37.364
You just crossed a line, Kolya.

10:37.527 --> 10:40.724
<i>We found that a minimum of three
hours between feeding sessions...</i>

10:40.887 --> 10:43.685
<i>... is crucial to ensure the body
has sufficient time...</i>

10:43.847 --> 10:45.246
<i>... to recover from the trauma.</i>

10:45.447 --> 10:47.677
<i>That’s the time you have to decide.</i>

10:49.167 --> 10:50.316
<i>Three hours.</i>

10:59.607 --> 11:03.566
- They called you Sheppard.
- Yeah.

11:04.207 --> 11:06.163
That’s my name.

11:06.327 --> 11:08.397
Pleased to meet you.

11:09.447 --> 11:11.403
You are in pain.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.365
Well, l just got fed on by a Wraith,
what do you think ?

11:15.527 --> 11:16.880
l would not know.

11:17.047 --> 11:19.959
Yeah, hopefully,
you’Il never have to find out.

11:23.967 --> 11:26.037
l didn’t think anything
could hurt that much.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.516
You’re still alive.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.440
Yeah. Well...

11:31.607 --> 11:35.156
... l don’t know how many years
the darned thing took off my life.

11:35.327 --> 11:36.760
But l’Il tell you this...

11:36.927 --> 11:40.078
... if Kolya’s men hadn’t have pulled
that damned thing off...

11:40.247 --> 11:42.807
... l’d be dust in a flak jacket.

11:42.967 --> 11:45.083
Do you blame the Wraith...

11:45.247 --> 11:47.203
... or the master ?

11:48.207 --> 11:50.038
l’m gonna go with both.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.522
There is a difference.

11:53.007 --> 11:55.805
The Wraith must feed in order to live.

11:57.607 --> 12:02.397
For a Wraith, hunger burns like a fire.

12:03.887 --> 12:06.401
Tell me, Sheppard...

12:06.567 --> 12:10.560
... if you found yourself
burning alive...

12:10.727 --> 12:15.323
... would you settle
for just one drop of water...

12:15.647 --> 12:18.036
... or would you take more ?

12:20.367 --> 12:22.517
Where did you hear them
call me Sheppard ?

12:25.327 --> 12:28.603
Just before l started to feed.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.236
Of course, you would see him
only as the monster...

12:36.407 --> 12:38.238
... who tried to take your city
from you.

12:38.407 --> 12:41.524
Kolya also killed several of our people.

12:41.687 --> 12:43.962
He would have killed Dr. Weir as well.

12:44.127 --> 12:46.243
l won’t make excuses for his actions
or mine...

12:46.407 --> 12:48.159
... during the failed Atlantis mission.

12:48.327 --> 12:50.045
We were soldiers under Cowen’s
orders.

12:50.207 --> 12:53.244
But that failure shattered Kolya’s
stature among the Genii.

12:53.407 --> 12:55.238
It forced him
from Cowen’s inner circle.

12:56.127 --> 12:57.355
You managed to stay.

12:58.327 --> 13:00.045
Cowen had no choice but to keep me.

13:00.207 --> 13:01.481
l was his chief scientist.

13:01.687 --> 13:03.166
You left Kolya out in the cold ?

13:03.327 --> 13:05.477
That was his choice, not mine.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.363
l will admit, in what little contact
we had...

13:08.527 --> 13:10.324
... before Kolya went underground...

13:10.487 --> 13:12.876
... he spoke of overthrowing
Cowen’s corrupt regime.

13:13.047 --> 13:14.719
And l was admittedly torn.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.360
Out of loyalty to Cowen ?

13:16.567 --> 13:19.001
Out of the belief that neither man
had what it took...

13:19.167 --> 13:20.805
... to lead the Genii
into the future.

13:21.007 --> 13:24.317
So instead, you, having what it took
overthrew Cowen yourself ?

13:24.487 --> 13:28.082
Kolya believes l’ve taken his rightful
place as leader of our people.

13:28.287 --> 13:29.515
No wonder he’s pissed.

13:29.727 --> 13:32.036
Well, obviously he has men
loyal to him...

13:32.207 --> 13:35.085
... in your inner circle,
hence the codes.

13:35.287 --> 13:38.836
- Well, those traitors will be found.
- Sounds like you’re the traitor to me.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.002
Must he be here ?

13:41.207 --> 13:43.846
The more l hear,
the more l’m glad he is.

13:46.247 --> 13:49.080
l could have told you anything.
l chose to tell you the truth.

13:50.647 --> 13:54.037
If you trade my life for Sheppard,
you will not only yield to blackmail...

13:54.207 --> 13:56.516
... but you will be planting
the seeds of civil war.

13:56.687 --> 13:59.326
So what ? l say we turn him over
and let them fight it out.

13:59.527 --> 14:01.040
- We can’t do that.
- Why not ?

14:01.207 --> 14:03.004
Because.

14:03.687 --> 14:05.678
Well, can we ?

14:05.887 --> 14:08.003
Colonel Sheppard
has already ordered us not to.

14:09.927 --> 14:12.521
At this point, it’s not his decision.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.163
There’s still time for us to find him
and launch a rescue operation.

14:16.327 --> 14:19.046
- Has there been any progress ?
- We have a list of planets...

14:19.207 --> 14:21.516
... where recent Genii activity’s
been documented...

14:21.687 --> 14:24.247
... we’d have a much higher margin
of success if Ladon...

14:24.407 --> 14:27.558
... would point out firm locations of
Genii safe houses and shelters.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.406
Maybe even hidden
Wraith-infested torture chambers.

14:39.727 --> 14:41.718
Your anger will only weaken you.

14:41.927 --> 14:43.645
l don’t think so.

14:45.447 --> 14:48.166
Do you realize he is torturing
both of us ?

14:48.327 --> 14:51.125
- Oh, yeah ? What’d he do to you ?
- He stopped me.

14:51.287 --> 14:53.721
Really ? And how is that torture ?

14:54.207 --> 14:56.846
Have you ever known starvation,
Sheppard ?

14:58.167 --> 15:02.683
The few years l took from you
are barely enough to keep me alive.

15:02.847 --> 15:05.805
The strength l gained from you
is already fading.

15:06.007 --> 15:07.042
l don’t give a damn.

15:07.207 --> 15:11.997
You pace in your cell,
cursing that l took years from you.

15:12.167 --> 15:15.682
l stand here cursing
that l was not allowed them all.

15:17.567 --> 15:20.445
Each in our own way, we suffer.

15:21.647 --> 15:23.558
This might come as a surprise
to you...

15:23.727 --> 15:26.764
... but l’m not really in the mood
for conversation.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.681
So why don’t you just do me a favor
and shut the hell up !

15:32.647 --> 15:35.957
These are your last hours, Sheppard.

15:36.127 --> 15:38.436
If you wish to spend them
in silence...

15:40.087 --> 15:41.679
... then so be it.

15:41.847 --> 15:44.441
No. l’m getting out of here.

15:45.887 --> 15:49.163
l got a life to go back to
and l’m damn well going back to it.

15:49.367 --> 15:54.122
- You’re sure of that ?
- Yeah. l got friends.

15:55.207 --> 15:56.925
And they’re gonna come for me.

15:57.127 --> 16:00.756
l hope you continue to believe that...

16:00.927 --> 16:03.600
... the next time l feed.

16:06.927 --> 16:10.317
l’m just saying, if you decide in favor
of trading for Col. Sheppard...

16:10.487 --> 16:13.285
... it would be best if you did so
before the next feeding.

16:13.447 --> 16:15.642
l don’t know how many sessions
a man can take...

16:15.847 --> 16:17.599
... even someone as strong
as Sheppard.

16:17.807 --> 16:20.241
Is it possible he can recover
from this ?

16:20.447 --> 16:23.245
We still know so little
about the feeding process.

16:23.407 --> 16:25.796
All l can tell you is that
each time he’s fed upon...

16:25.967 --> 16:28.242
... his chances of survival
diminish severely.

16:29.447 --> 16:33.156
Dr. Weir, we’ve got a match.
We went through the database.

16:33.327 --> 16:34.760
Between our list and Ladon’s...

16:34.927 --> 16:37.487
... there’s only one potential location
that makes sense.

16:37.647 --> 16:39.239
Go.

16:44.287 --> 16:46.482
All right, let’s do this one
by the numbers.

16:46.647 --> 16:48.797
We get in. We get our man.
We get out.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.923
Stay sharp and stay alive.

16:51.087 --> 16:53.282
What are you on about ?

16:53.447 --> 16:56.086
Oh, things that Sheppard would say,
so l thought l would--

16:56.247 --> 16:59.523
- Well said, Rodney.
- Just stay behind me.

16:59.927 --> 17:01.360
Right.

17:04.127 --> 17:05.320
Just bring him back.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.117
l thought you said
this wasn’t personal.

17:14.287 --> 17:16.517
The truth is,
l would’ve settled for Dr. McKay.

17:16.727 --> 17:19.763
But l don’t imagine l would enjoy
his constant wailing.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.958
They’re never gonna make
the trade, Kolya.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.719
Why don’t you just finish this ?

17:23.887 --> 17:27.323
l think you underestimate
the sympathetic nature of Dr. Weir.

17:27.527 --> 17:29.836
Well, then you underestimate
Élizabeth.

17:30.047 --> 17:33.437
You’d prefer l stormed Atlantis
and take Ladon by force ?

17:35.967 --> 17:36.956
What do you got ?

17:38.367 --> 17:42.076
Half a dozen men and a starving Wraith ?
Yeah, you go right ahead.

17:42.247 --> 17:44.124
One way or the other, Ladon is mine.

17:44.327 --> 17:47.000
Protecting him is a waste of my time
and your life.

17:47.207 --> 17:48.686
What’d he do to you ?

17:50.647 --> 17:53.764
l was the one planning
to overthrow Cowen.

17:54.367 --> 17:57.086
Ladon disclosed those plans,
forcing me underground...

17:57.287 --> 17:59.596
... then staged a coup of his own.

17:59.807 --> 18:01.684
He took what was rightfully mine.

18:03.567 --> 18:04.886
Bring in the Wraith.

18:24.007 --> 18:25.599
Go on, go on.

18:30.687 --> 18:32.006
Spread out.

18:50.007 --> 18:51.486
It’s just the caretaker.

19:05.567 --> 19:06.761
Rodney.

19:06.967 --> 19:10.243
l saw something out of the corner
of my eye. You know, l reacted.

19:10.447 --> 19:11.436
What is it ?

19:13.007 --> 19:16.886
A mouse. A really big one, though.
More of a rat, really. Possibly rabid.

19:17.087 --> 19:19.521
- This isn’t the place, is it ?
- l do not believe so.

19:19.687 --> 19:21.757
No. Sheppard wasn’t here.

19:21.967 --> 19:24.117
And we’ve just wasted two
and a half hours.

19:24.287 --> 19:27.199
- Let’s move out.
- And a mouse.

19:28.247 --> 19:29.839
Your intel was wrong.

19:30.447 --> 19:33.439
Then the only way for me to help
is to return to my homeworld...

19:33.607 --> 19:35.643
... and mobilize the resources
of my military.

19:35.847 --> 19:37.166
Contact them from here.

19:37.327 --> 19:39.921
Do you think l don’t know
the reason you’re keeping me ?

19:40.087 --> 19:42.965
You are a head of state.
It was John Sheppard’s last order...

19:43.127 --> 19:45.118
... that we do not submit
to Kolya’s demands.

19:45.287 --> 19:48.199
It is my own country’s policy
to never yield to terrorists.

19:48.367 --> 19:51.086
Those are the reasons
you’re still here, Mr. Radim.

19:51.247 --> 19:53.556
Because believe me,
if it was simply my choice--

19:53.727 --> 19:54.876
- l understand.
- Good.

19:55.047 --> 19:56.480
- How-- ?
- We don’t have much time.

19:56.647 --> 19:59.480
l want you to look over our list
and see if there’s anything--

19:59.647 --> 20:01.160
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

20:05.327 --> 20:07.124
It looks to be another video feed.

20:07.287 --> 20:09.721
Patch it through and open a channel.

20:11.647 --> 20:14.320
<i>Dr. Weir, as promised.</i>

20:15.447 --> 20:16.436
Where’s Sheppard ?

20:16.607 --> 20:20.885
<i>I’m pleased to see you’re wasting
no time. So neither will I.</i>

20:35.327 --> 20:37.079
<i>Will you turn Ladon Radim
over to me...</i>

20:37.247 --> 20:38.965
<i>... in exchange for Colonel Sheppard ?</i>

20:40.927 --> 20:42.246
<i>Dr. Weir ?</i>

20:43.007 --> 20:44.486
No.

20:45.607 --> 20:48.326
<i>I can only conclude you doubt
my sincerity.</i>

21:06.567 --> 21:07.966
Enough.

21:19.607 --> 21:20.801
<i>Three hours.</i>

21:42.727 --> 21:44.240
Where are your friends ?

21:44.927 --> 21:48.363
- They’Il be here.
- You still believe that ?

21:48.527 --> 21:50.518
Yeah, l do.

21:51.087 --> 21:52.759
They just need more time.

21:52.967 --> 21:55.527
No one has ever left this place alive.

21:55.687 --> 21:57.803
Yeah, well, l’m going to.

21:57.967 --> 22:02.438
Kolya will kill you before your friends
have a chance to reach these cells.

22:05.087 --> 22:07.203
How well do you know
the layout of this place ?

22:07.367 --> 22:10.325
Well enough to know
what they would be up against.

22:20.847 --> 22:22.360
What about us ?

22:22.567 --> 22:26.480
Do you know enough about
this place to get us out ?

22:27.567 --> 22:28.795
You and me ?

22:29.407 --> 22:31.602
Why, are they gonna let you go
after l’m dead ?

22:32.287 --> 22:34.562
- No.
- Then what have you got to lose ?

22:35.807 --> 22:36.876
My life.

22:37.087 --> 22:39.521
Oh, yeah, you’ve got a great one
down here.

22:40.807 --> 22:42.365
Listen...

22:42.927 --> 22:45.282
... it makes sense.

22:45.727 --> 22:47.797
We have a common goal.

22:49.487 --> 22:51.239
As l said before...

22:52.727 --> 22:54.638
... there is no escape.

23:03.327 --> 23:04.726
Move.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.606
<i>He still has years ahead
of him, Dr. Weir.</i>

23:28.807 --> 23:31.446
<i>- my offer stands.
- So does my answer.</i>

23:32.887 --> 23:34.923
<i>Then you’re effectively
ending his life.</i>

23:35.887 --> 23:37.206
l’m not gonna go there.

23:38.807 --> 23:39.922
<i>Is Ladon there ?</i>

23:41.367 --> 23:42.402
l am.

23:42.567 --> 23:44.080
<i>I wonder what you’ve told them...</i>

23:44.247 --> 23:46.397
<i>... so they’d choose you over
one of their own.</i>

23:46.607 --> 23:48.086
That l betrayed you.

23:48.247 --> 23:50.807
That l took for myself
what you believed to be yours.

23:51.007 --> 23:52.725
<i>The truth ?</i>

23:53.127 --> 23:55.357
<i>I must say I’m surprised.</i>

23:55.567 --> 23:56.556
If you release him...

23:56.727 --> 23:59.480
... you may return to our people
with my promise of amnesty.

23:59.687 --> 24:01.882
<i>Please, Ladon,
I’ve trained you better than that.</i>

24:02.047 --> 24:04.686
<i>There are things that cannot
be undone.</i>

24:04.847 --> 24:06.838
That’s not true.
You can end this.

24:07.007 --> 24:10.522
<i>Strange, doctor, I was just about
to say the same thing.</i>

24:13.687 --> 24:14.915
Take your fill.

24:30.967 --> 24:32.161
Who told you to stop ?

24:32.847 --> 24:34.963
He is near death.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.518
Shall l finish him ?

24:41.767 --> 24:43.086
Get it out of here.

24:49.967 --> 24:51.605
<i>Now it’s two hours.</i>

24:55.007 --> 24:57.077
If he’s fed upon again,
he’s as good as dead.

24:57.247 --> 24:59.841
- We don’t know that.
- Aye, Rodney, we do.

25:00.007 --> 25:02.965
He may already be past the point
of no return.

25:03.167 --> 25:06.637
We know that a large percentage of
those that survive a partial feeding...

25:06.807 --> 25:08.604
... die anyway...

25:08.767 --> 25:11.759
... due to complications
as a result of strain on the system.

25:12.567 --> 25:15.161
What appears as physical aging
is actually a byproduct...

25:15.327 --> 25:18.637
... of a complex process
we barely understand.

25:21.567 --> 25:24.240
l can’t imagine him surviving
another session...

25:24.407 --> 25:26.682
... whether it’s two hours
or 10 hours from now.

25:26.887 --> 25:29.196
If you were half the man
Sheppard is...

25:29.367 --> 25:32.040
... you’d volunteer
to make the trade yourself.

25:32.807 --> 25:36.163
The truth is, l’m not sure whether
or not l would have made the trade...

25:36.327 --> 25:38.124
... if our roles were reversed.

25:39.687 --> 25:43.282
So l ask you, allow what you have
done for me to be worth something.

25:44.967 --> 25:46.605
There is nothing more l can do here.

25:46.767 --> 25:49.884
But l can get the information
to find Sheppard if you allow me...

25:50.047 --> 25:53.642
... to return and interrogate the men
who stole the codes from me.

26:17.887 --> 26:21.675
You know, l could’ve sworn
l was gonna wake up dead today.

26:22.327 --> 26:24.283
You are strong.

26:24.847 --> 26:28.203
Stronger than any human
l have ever fed upon.

26:29.407 --> 26:33.286
- You stopped yourself.
- Yes.

26:34.127 --> 26:35.116
Why ?

26:35.287 --> 26:39.838
Because the longer l feed,
the weaker you become.

26:40.407 --> 26:43.558
And we will need
what strength you have left...

26:44.127 --> 26:45.321
... to escape.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.280
Now he wants to escape.

26:54.687 --> 26:57.485
l lack the words to thank you,
Dr. Weir.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.963
l didn’t do this for you.

27:00.127 --> 27:02.118
Well, nevertheless...

27:02.807 --> 27:05.924
... l’Il be in touch the moment l have
the information that you need.

27:06.087 --> 27:07.281
Thank you.

27:09.607 --> 27:12.804
Why do l have the sinking feeling
we’ve just made a terrible mistake ?

27:12.967 --> 27:14.480
Because we have.

27:14.647 --> 27:16.922
l’m not so sure, Ronon.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.999
Which way ?

29:07.607 --> 29:09.882
This way.

29:47.767 --> 29:49.723
It will heal.

29:50.647 --> 29:52.717
This way.

30:11.007 --> 30:12.838
They did this together.

30:13.007 --> 30:15.123
They’ve taken weapons.

30:15.967 --> 30:18.322
l want 10 armed men
at the stargate.

30:18.487 --> 30:20.796
The rest of you, hunt them down.

30:43.527 --> 30:46.166
- How far is the stargate ?
- It will be guarded.

30:46.327 --> 30:49.046
- We’ve got guns.
- They will be waiting for us.

30:49.207 --> 30:51.243
Don’t be so negative.

30:53.207 --> 30:55.562
Do you think you’re gonna make it ?

30:55.727 --> 30:57.160
If l feed.

30:57.367 --> 30:59.517
Well, don’t look at me.

31:05.647 --> 31:09.322
We make it to the stargate,
we both go our separate ways.

31:09.487 --> 31:11.284
Until then...

31:11.447 --> 31:13.597
... we’re gonna need each other.
Deal ?

31:34.767 --> 31:36.359
Dr. Weir ?

31:40.047 --> 31:41.719
How long has it been ?

31:41.887 --> 31:43.445
It’s coming up on two hours.

31:43.607 --> 31:46.246
We should receive the next
transmission any minute now.

31:46.447 --> 31:48.836
Yes, l’Il be there in a moment.

31:52.127 --> 31:55.039
l was blindfolded all the way
to the bunker. It wasn’t this far.

31:55.207 --> 31:57.198
If l could just move faster.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.998
We’Il rest here a few minutes.

32:03.167 --> 32:04.839
You should go on without me.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.645
No.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.958
The gate’s guarded.

32:09.607 --> 32:13.441
Got a better chance of taking
out the guards in a crossfire.

32:14.607 --> 32:17.917
- l still need you.
- Very well.

32:18.727 --> 32:22.117
That is, even if we’re going
in the right direction.

32:27.887 --> 32:31.277
You have no idea
where the stargate is, do you ?

32:33.727 --> 32:35.877
It was many years ago.

32:36.087 --> 32:39.045
Way to go, John.
Listen to a Wraith.

32:39.207 --> 32:42.677
It was not my intention
to deceive you, Sheppard.

32:44.207 --> 32:47.279
<i>Our reinforcements have arrived
at the stargate, commander.</i>

32:47.447 --> 32:50.883
<i>Kill the Wraith on sight,
but I want Sheppard alive.</i>

32:51.047 --> 32:52.639
Well...

32:53.127 --> 32:54.924
... we learned two things :

32:55.087 --> 32:56.679
One...

32:56.847 --> 32:58.280
... he likes me better than you.

32:59.927 --> 33:04.284
Two, we probably never would’ve
made it to the stargate anyway.

33:05.327 --> 33:08.239
- Then it is over.
- No.

33:08.407 --> 33:10.557
Our people don’t leave
each other behind.

33:10.727 --> 33:14.083
- That’s three things you’ve learned.
- You still believe that ?

33:14.287 --> 33:17.279
Kolya doesn’t know where we are.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.922
He’s wasting manpower...

33:20.127 --> 33:23.164
... that could be used searching
for us, guarding the gate.

33:23.327 --> 33:27.115
The odds of my people finding us
are going up and up.

33:27.287 --> 33:31.041
You are more like Wraith
than you know.

33:31.207 --> 33:33.721
l’m not sure l like the sound of that.

33:33.927 --> 33:39.684
There is much about a Wraith
that you do not know, Sheppard.

33:43.447 --> 33:45.039
- Kolya’s late.
- That is not like him.

33:45.207 --> 33:47.277
We haven’t heard anything
from Ladon either.

33:47.447 --> 33:48.596
We will.

33:48.767 --> 33:52.680
- Is it possible they were in on this ?
- No. l don’t think so.

33:52.887 --> 33:55.037
Why would Ladon come here
in the first place ?

33:55.247 --> 33:56.282
Throw us off the scent.

33:56.447 --> 33:59.007
- What kind of a plan would that be ?
- Genii.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.156
True.

34:00.367 --> 34:03.439
Either way, there must be a reason
why Kolya has not contacted us.

34:03.647 --> 34:06.639
Perhaps he knew it would take
Col. Sheppard more time to recover.

34:06.807 --> 34:10.561
None of us are saying what
we’re all thinking here.

34:10.726 --> 34:11.842
No, Rodney, we’re not.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.117
<i>Tell Kolya there’s nobody around
the gate.</i>

34:18.286 --> 34:21.324
Sounds like they’re concentrating
their search around the gate.

34:22.967 --> 34:25.356
They must think we knew
where we were going.

34:27.847 --> 34:30.440
Oh, it was worth it...

34:30.647 --> 34:32.797
... if only to see the sky again.

34:33.007 --> 34:35.885
l got slightly higher expectations.

34:36.087 --> 34:38.476
My wound is deep.

34:39.047 --> 34:41.607
If l do not feed soon...

34:43.127 --> 34:44.719
... l will die.

34:44.927 --> 34:47.885
Buck up. We got a deal, remember ?

34:48.726 --> 34:52.242
We both go home alive.

34:52.806 --> 34:54.922
And if we were...

34:55.647 --> 34:58.320
... to meet again in the future ?

34:59.207 --> 35:00.959
What then ?

35:04.807 --> 35:06.525
All bets are off.

35:11.047 --> 35:15.165
Then let us hope
we do not meet again.

35:15.367 --> 35:18.245
Try to get some sleep.
l’Il take the first watch.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.606
l’m receiving the new Genii IDC
along with a video feed.

35:25.767 --> 35:28.440
- Ladon.
- Put it on the screen.

35:31.447 --> 35:33.119
<i>Are you receiving me ?</i>

35:33.287 --> 35:34.766
We were starting to get worried.

35:34.927 --> 35:37.316
<i>Yes, I’m sure you had doubts...</i>

35:37.487 --> 35:40.479
<i>... but the truth is, the interrogation
took longer than I hoped.</i>

35:40.647 --> 35:42.763
<i>We’ve secured the location
of Kolya’s base.</i>

35:42.927 --> 35:45.043
<i>I’m forwarding you
the dialing coordinates now.</i>

35:45.207 --> 35:46.322
Are you certain ?

35:46.487 --> 35:49.206
<i>Certain enough to send
a full brigade through the gate.</i>

35:49.367 --> 35:51.597
<i>It will take us an hour
to marshal our forces.</i>

35:51.807 --> 35:54.799
<i>-I thought you might want that time.
- What will we be up against ?</i>

35:54.967 --> 35:58.164
<i>Nothing one of your Jumpers and
my friend Ronon couldn’t handle.</i>

35:58.727 --> 36:03.084
<i>I ask only that you leave Kolya
for my own forces to find.</i>

36:06.327 --> 36:07.521
No promises.

36:08.327 --> 36:10.124
<i>I understand.</i>

36:11.007 --> 36:13.157
Get a cloaked Jumper
and a team of Marines.

36:13.327 --> 36:16.319
l’d like to reserve one seat
for a member of my medical team.

36:16.527 --> 36:18.916
Done. And if you do find Kolya--

36:19.127 --> 36:20.606
No promises.

36:20.807 --> 36:22.320
Exactly.

36:50.647 --> 36:52.046
They’re coming.

37:41.007 --> 37:42.565
The facility is straight ahead.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.719
We’re detecting life signs on
the surface, miles from the bunker.

37:45.887 --> 37:47.923
- How many ?
- When it first came, it was eight.

37:48.087 --> 37:50.521
Then four. l don’t get it,
now it’s just the two.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.718
- What’s going on ?
- One of them is Sheppard.

37:52.887 --> 37:54.923
His transmitter is still broadcasting.

37:55.127 --> 37:57.357
- Could the other one be Kolya ?
- Let’s hope so.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.957
Land 100 meters
to the south of their position.

38:13.927 --> 38:15.804
Finish it.

38:15.967 --> 38:20.040
As l told you, John Sheppard...

38:20.207 --> 38:25.440
... there are many things about Wraith
that you do not know.

38:41.607 --> 38:43.518
Wait !

38:45.407 --> 38:47.398
Leave him.

38:47.567 --> 38:49.478
That’s an order.

38:49.687 --> 38:51.757
l don’t understand.
We saw what he did to you.

38:51.967 --> 38:53.844
He just undid it.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.046
Lower your weapons.

38:57.687 --> 39:01.521
- How is this possible ?
- Don’t ask me.

39:02.887 --> 39:04.684
The gift of life...

39:04.847 --> 39:09.079
... is reserved only
for our most devout worshipers...

39:09.247 --> 39:11.761
... and our brothers.

39:13.887 --> 39:16.720
Well, l guess there’s a lot
about the Wraith we don’t know.

39:16.927 --> 39:19.316
Sheppard gave me back my life.

39:19.487 --> 39:21.443
l merely repaid the debt.

39:21.887 --> 39:24.845
What debt ? Are you kidding ?
He looks younger than he did before.

39:25.047 --> 39:27.322
What about Kolya ?

39:31.127 --> 39:33.687
Kolya, this is Sheppard.

39:34.367 --> 39:37.598
Kolya. l figured you’d run.

39:37.767 --> 39:41.362
<i>Next time,
I kill you on sight, do you hear me ?</i>

39:46.607 --> 39:48.325
Let’s get off this rock.

39:49.247 --> 39:50.999
What about him ?

39:53.367 --> 39:54.595
We had a deal, right ?

39:55.167 --> 39:58.921
l did not truly expect you
to honor it.

40:12.607 --> 40:15.405
- You didn’t kill him.
- No, l didn’t.

40:15.567 --> 40:18.479
Get him in the Jumper. We’re gonna
drop him off somewhere.

40:22.367 --> 40:24.323
Thanks for showing up.

40:30.767 --> 40:33.759
Sheppard. l thought you--

40:33.927 --> 40:35.883
There’s a lot you don’t know
about humans.

40:40.607 --> 40:43.167
l see.

40:46.247 --> 40:48.681
Next time we meet ?

40:50.447 --> 40:52.403
All bets are off.
