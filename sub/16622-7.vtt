00:00.016 --> 00:01.470
Previously on "secrets and lies"...

00:01.480 --> 00:03.792
- You look well.
- I stopped using.

00:03.802 --> 00:05.094
- Is your father home?
- Nope.

00:05.104 --> 00:07.336
Why would you leave her alone?
She could relapse.

00:07.346 --> 00:08.946
I don't have anything
from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

00:08.956 --> 00:10.317
Someone erased everything.

00:10.327 --> 00:13.184
She was blonde and had a lot
of makeup and high heels.

00:13.194 --> 00:15.411
Kate caught Neil having sex
with someone in his office.

00:15.421 --> 00:16.387
It was Melanie.

00:16.397 --> 00:17.780
It's his daughter, man!
He's gonna hurt you.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.337
Y-your daughter was just there.

00:19.347 --> 00:20.624
Carly's a call girl.

00:20.634 --> 00:22.618
Someone set up an account
without authorization?

00:22.628 --> 00:24.741
I'm trying to find out.
You set up an account

00:24.751 --> 00:26.223
so you could siphon
money from this firm!

00:26.233 --> 00:29.326
- That's insane!
- Here's the opening paperwork.

00:29.969 --> 00:34.572
- Leave a message.
- Patrick, it's me again. Call me back.

00:56.896 --> 00:59.263
I get it. You're angry.

00:59.332 --> 01:02.440
But cutting off communications
isn't gonna help.

01:03.378 --> 01:06.396
Neither is leaving the company in
crisis a week after my wife died,

01:06.406 --> 01:09.240
but that's what you do...
You... you leave.

01:09.342 --> 01:11.475
Well, I'm here now.

01:11.495 --> 01:14.835
And I understand you
resolved the crisis.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.502
May I come in?

01:22.206 --> 01:25.207
I put you in a tight spot.
I shouldn't have.

01:25.276 --> 01:27.076
You told me to obey you.

01:27.178 --> 01:29.378
I made a call you didn't like.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.914
No, you insulted my wife.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.149
I questioned one of her decisions.

01:34.251 --> 01:35.818
You don't talk to a man about his wife!

01:35.920 --> 01:38.921
I never said a word to you about yours.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.323
I didn't get the respect
that I gave you,

01:41.333 --> 01:44.275
the respect that I earned
raising your family!

01:45.126 --> 01:48.297
I had to travel when you kids were
young. I was growing the business.

01:48.307 --> 01:52.524
Dad, do you have any idea what it
was like for us while you were away?

01:52.970 --> 01:54.369
Or... or were you just so blinded

01:54.438 --> 01:56.943
by this unconditional love
for that... that woman?

01:56.953 --> 01:58.107
Don't talk about your mother.

01:58.209 --> 02:00.042
No, Dad, she was an abusive drunk.

02:00.144 --> 02:02.069
She was cruel, and we
were all scared of her!

02:02.079 --> 02:04.483
She's not here anymore, is she?

02:06.217 --> 02:08.684
It's the... It's the past.

02:13.183 --> 02:14.323
The past?

02:19.897 --> 02:22.297
Why do you think Patrick drinks?

02:22.875 --> 02:25.801
Because alcoholism is genetic.

02:25.870 --> 02:28.821
And Patrick always
takes the easy way out.

02:31.275 --> 02:33.504
Maybe that's genetic, too.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.212
We were in trouble, and you bailed.

02:38.115 --> 02:39.281
Mm.

02:40.114 --> 02:42.035
Sounds pretty easy to me.

02:44.197 --> 02:46.188
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

02:46.257 --> 02:48.624
I suggest you get over it.

02:48.726 --> 02:50.907
I'll see you back at the office.

Synced and corrected by johnyd13

03:06.675 --> 03:08.822
- Did you bring her in?
- Yeah.

03:08.832 --> 03:10.546
Good.

03:11.070 --> 03:14.049
- Well, let's get started.
- She's already being questioned.

03:14.059 --> 03:15.417
By who?

03:15.519 --> 03:19.969
Can you confirm that this is what you
were wearing the night Kate Warner died?

03:21.025 --> 03:22.624
It is.

03:22.726 --> 03:25.961
Got this little number on
my last trip to New York.

03:26.063 --> 03:28.931
It was a girls' weekend.

03:29.033 --> 03:30.799
Mm.

03:30.901 --> 03:33.502
- Well, I'm gonna need it.
- Why?

03:33.604 --> 03:36.605
We're asking all key witnesses to hand
over the clothes they were wearing

03:36.707 --> 03:39.357
the night your
sister-in-law was murdered.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.077
Okay, fine.

03:42.179 --> 03:45.062
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not wearing it now.

03:50.421 --> 03:52.287
Let's walk through the night
in question, shall we?

03:52.389 --> 03:54.319
I don't know why he's
taking our interrogation.

03:54.415 --> 03:55.891
He's doing well.

03:55.993 --> 03:58.160
Around 9:30, the night of the party,

03:58.262 --> 04:01.534
about three hours of
security footage was erased.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.679
Well, that must make things difficult.

04:03.689 --> 04:05.200
Well, it would if we didn't already have

04:05.302 --> 04:07.436
a pretty good idea of
who was responsible.

04:07.538 --> 04:10.230
Well, why don't you talk to them?

04:10.353 --> 04:11.631
I am.

04:13.110 --> 04:16.111
A witness saw you leaving
the security office at that time.

04:16.180 --> 04:18.079
Care to explain what
you were doing there?

04:18.182 --> 04:21.183
Oh, that's the thing about witnesses.

04:21.285 --> 04:24.152
- They're very unreliable.
- Not always.

04:24.255 --> 04:27.406
So you better have a
logical explanation.

04:29.193 --> 04:33.746
Uh, well, what I mean to say
is your witness is mistaken.

04:34.336 --> 04:35.764
I was in the lobby, yes,

04:35.866 --> 04:39.155
but I was leaving the
ladies' room, not security.

04:39.384 --> 04:41.570
You went down 10 floors for that?

04:41.672 --> 04:45.207
Upstairs line was ridiculous,
and I had to pee.

04:45.276 --> 04:48.981
Oh. You men don't have
that problem, do you?

04:51.315 --> 04:54.016
There you go. That's why.

04:54.368 --> 04:56.451
Oh, he took our witness so
she could flirt with him?

04:56.553 --> 04:58.487
She's looking for Daddy.

04:58.990 --> 05:02.534
Well, if you weren't
in the security room,

05:02.763 --> 05:07.113
can you explain how your fingerprints
got on the computer keyboard in there?

05:07.498 --> 05:09.482
No, I can't.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.072
Maybe I'm being framed.

05:12.231 --> 05:14.636
Who would want to frame you?

05:15.078 --> 05:17.005
Not all the Warners are fans.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.599
That's true, isn't it?

05:18.609 --> 05:21.569
Your father-in-law made you
sign a prenup, didn't he?

05:21.579 --> 05:24.680
Even though he didn't do it
for Kate or for Greg, either.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.474
Seems there was something
uniquely wrong with you.

05:27.484 --> 05:29.184
They're a bunch of elitist snobs.

05:29.286 --> 05:32.336
The only nice one aside
from my husband was Kate.

05:32.346 --> 05:33.347
Hmm.

05:33.357 --> 05:37.693
How did you get along with the S.E.G.
employees, like Neil Oliver?

05:37.795 --> 05:39.194
Very well.

05:39.296 --> 05:41.830
I'm the wife of the
founding partner's son.

05:41.932 --> 05:44.782
They all pretend to love me.
Are we done here?

05:46.797 --> 05:47.960
For now.

05:51.657 --> 05:54.176
We didn't get fingerprints
off that keyboard, right?

05:54.186 --> 05:56.378
No, but she doesn't know that.

06:05.155 --> 06:06.888
Salted caramel squares.

06:12.096 --> 06:14.363
There it is. Right there.

06:16.474 --> 06:20.202
Listen, um... Patrick
did something stupid.

06:20.304 --> 06:21.536
Mm.

06:21.638 --> 06:23.138
What is it this time?

06:24.337 --> 06:27.109
He opened a $12 million line of credit

06:27.211 --> 06:30.182
and leveraged it against an S.E.G. fund.

06:31.815 --> 06:33.474
- That's fraud.
- I know, I know.

06:33.484 --> 06:37.819
Our idiot brother committed
a felony buying houses.

06:37.921 --> 06:42.378
B-but... Patrick doesn't even
know anything about real estate.

06:42.388 --> 06:43.825
Why would he...

06:45.396 --> 06:47.712
Unless this was Melanie's idea.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.467
You know he'd do anything for her.

06:50.477 --> 06:53.055
Not if he found out about her and Neil.

06:53.522 --> 06:55.203
What about her and Neil?

06:55.272 --> 06:58.360
I-it doesn't matter.
Listen, what... What does matter

06:58.370 --> 07:02.044
is that Kate knew about the fraud, okay?

07:02.146 --> 07:03.879
And if... If he confronted her...

07:04.014 --> 07:05.488
You don't think that
Patrick killed Kate...

07:05.498 --> 07:08.317
I don't want to think that. I can't.

07:08.599 --> 07:11.119
But $12 million and fraud...

07:11.221 --> 07:13.088
That's motive, right?

07:14.391 --> 07:17.710
And... and either Melanie is
protecting him or she's in on it, too.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.341
Protecting him how?

07:21.131 --> 07:25.728
Melanie erased the security footage
from S.E.G. the night Kate was killed.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.204
Okay.

07:29.306 --> 07:32.107
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

07:32.176 --> 07:35.043
The two of them are definitely
involved in something,

07:35.145 --> 07:39.948
but we don't know what,
so you need to talk to Patrick.

08:12.549 --> 08:14.316
Where's Patrick?

08:14.326 --> 08:16.918
- Not home.
- Hmm. How convenient.

08:17.020 --> 08:18.753
I just saw Neil slithering away.

08:18.856 --> 08:21.490
- Neil was looking for Patrick, too.
- Yeah, I'm sure he was.

08:21.558 --> 08:23.191
Okay, I'm not gonna
fight with you, Eric.

08:23.293 --> 08:25.060
You want to talk to your brother,
call him on his cell.

08:25.162 --> 08:26.828
Stop. Stop.

08:28.332 --> 08:31.832
Why did you erase the security
footage the night Kate died?

08:32.957 --> 08:34.693
I have my reasons.

08:35.364 --> 08:37.272
You can't prove anything,
and it's not illegal.

08:37.374 --> 08:39.241
It is if it has to do
with my wife's death.

08:39.342 --> 08:41.510
- Go home, Eric.
- No, I'm not giving up.

08:41.611 --> 08:42.677
I'm gonna find out what you're up to.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.312
Oh, all you'll do is
drive a bigger wedge

08:44.381 --> 08:46.441
between you and Patrick.

08:46.451 --> 08:49.601
You wanted a rift in the family,
well, you have one.

08:59.363 --> 09:01.029
Where are we?

09:01.559 --> 09:03.698
Same place as yesterday.

09:03.767 --> 09:06.735
The vic was pushed off
the roof. No weapons.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.303
I'm thinking it's a crime of passion

09:08.372 --> 09:11.082
since it doesn't appear
to be premeditated.

09:11.337 --> 09:12.666
The whole family was at the party.

09:12.676 --> 09:14.635
You haven't eliminated any of them yet.

09:14.645 --> 09:16.339
Because I can't.

09:16.453 --> 09:18.446
It's hard to alibi someone at a party.

09:18.549 --> 09:21.816
I'm swimming in suspects. What
I don't have is forensic evidence.

09:21.919 --> 09:24.625
You have a print on that
planter from your crime scene.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.555
It was a partial. It's useless.

09:30.561 --> 09:32.460
What is it?

09:32.529 --> 09:33.762
I'll be right there.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.063
Everything all right?

09:35.132 --> 09:37.439
Will you excuse me for a moment?

09:55.519 --> 09:57.963
Jennifer's out of it
right now, but I'm told

09:57.973 --> 10:01.532
she was pretty animated when
the uniforms picked her up.

10:03.348 --> 10:06.161
- How did you know?
- One of the Unis is a buddy of mine.

10:06.263 --> 10:09.698
He knows we're working together,
so he gave me a call.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.166
What do you want to do?

10:11.268 --> 10:12.601
There's not much choice.

10:12.703 --> 10:15.003
Their incident report means
her parole's getting revoked.

10:15.105 --> 10:17.339
There's no incident report.

10:17.441 --> 10:20.276
You're police. She's your kid.

10:29.319 --> 10:31.119
I didn't ask you to do this.

10:31.221 --> 10:33.054
I know.

10:33.123 --> 10:35.156
So, what do you want to do?

10:50.904 --> 10:53.542
Thanks for bringing her home.

10:53.610 --> 10:57.612
I don't think sending Jennifer
back to jail is the answer.

10:57.714 --> 11:00.048
Four stints in rehab wasn't, either.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.716
Well, she's going to meetings, Andrea.

11:01.726 --> 11:03.118
She slipped.

11:05.375 --> 11:08.211
I honestly don't know what to do.

11:15.053 --> 11:18.353
I just don't want our daughter
to end up in the morgue.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.898
This is Patrick. Leave a message.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.934
Patrick, it's me. I'm at the office.

11:31.002 --> 11:33.303
I didn't see your car here.
Call me back.

11:38.677 --> 11:41.444
Eric, can you come in here, please?

11:41.546 --> 11:44.146
Would you get Neil in here,
as well, May?

11:51.922 --> 11:53.423
Good morning.

12:06.338 --> 12:08.777
Either one of you want to
tell me what's going on?

12:08.787 --> 12:10.974
Nothing's going on. He quit.

12:11.496 --> 12:14.114
You made it impossible for me to stay.

12:15.247 --> 12:16.661
What are you, 10?

12:16.785 --> 12:20.416
If you guys don't want to be friends,
that's fine, but this is a business.

12:20.426 --> 12:23.987
Neil is a good earner, and I'm not
gonna lose him to the competition.

12:24.089 --> 12:25.955
So, work it out.

12:26.024 --> 12:27.390
Today.

12:33.198 --> 12:35.732
Detective. Do you have news?

12:35.801 --> 12:39.102
I'm still waiting for that file
that your daughter promised me...

12:39.112 --> 12:41.604
Eric's juvenile record from
the Steven Porter incident?

12:41.673 --> 12:44.456
Right. Amanda asked me for that.
I couldn't find it in my office,

12:44.466 --> 12:46.075
but I'll check at my house tonight.

12:46.085 --> 12:48.288
You can send it to the
station tomorrow morning.

12:48.298 --> 12:50.646
Okay, but you already know
everything about the case.

12:50.656 --> 12:52.823
What could possibly be in
that file that's of interest?

12:52.925 --> 12:56.936
It's hard to say what's of interest
until I have all the facts.

12:56.946 --> 12:58.253
And if you could send your clothes

12:58.263 --> 13:00.397
from the night of the party,
I'd appreciate it.

13:00.499 --> 13:02.299
Why would you want my clothes?

13:02.368 --> 13:04.267
We're asking all key witnesses.

13:04.336 --> 13:06.570
I'm trying to find your
daughter-in-law's killer.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.739
I assume you want to cooperate.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.173
Of course.

13:10.275 --> 13:11.908
Oh, one more thing.

13:12.011 --> 13:14.544
Where were you this past week?

13:15.032 --> 13:17.147
Out of town on business.

13:17.897 --> 13:18.998
Mm.

13:22.221 --> 13:26.421
Let's put this behind us, Eric.
We've been friends for a long time.

13:27.351 --> 13:28.954
You keep lying to me,

13:28.964 --> 13:31.421
and if it has nothing to
do with Kate's death,

13:31.431 --> 13:33.175
I don't understand why.

13:34.236 --> 13:36.566
Look, I came clean about the escort.

13:36.635 --> 13:40.003
Everything else I did has been
to help you and your family.

13:40.072 --> 13:43.110
How is screwing my sister
helping my family?

13:44.827 --> 13:46.947
- Hmm?
- H-how did...

13:48.447 --> 13:50.966
Look, I-it wasn't like that.

13:55.754 --> 13:58.188
Okay. We can't do this.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.672
Maybe we could talk.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.894
What do you want to talk about?

14:03.996 --> 14:05.562
I just...

14:07.599 --> 14:09.849
Oh, God. Why are doing this to me?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.450
You really want me to stop?

14:19.812 --> 14:22.879
- Stop! That's my sister.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

14:22.889 --> 14:25.397
Do you really expect me to believe
that Amanda came on to you?

14:25.407 --> 14:28.652
Well, I don't care what
you believe. It's true.

14:29.416 --> 14:31.088
Why did Kate yell at you?

14:33.292 --> 14:36.593
In the office? Really?
She's my sister-in-law.

14:36.695 --> 14:38.995
Kate, she is a grown woman.
It's none of your business.

14:39.064 --> 14:41.475
I'm not here to protect Amanda.

14:41.485 --> 14:42.899
I see the way you look at her.

14:43.001 --> 14:45.749
Whatever happened, it's not real.

14:47.272 --> 14:49.634
Amanda will never love you back.

14:52.811 --> 14:56.213
So... You're in love with Amanda.

14:56.732 --> 14:58.181
Yeah.

14:58.283 --> 15:00.790
My sister, Amanda Warner.
You're in love with her?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.185
Yeah.

15:02.254 --> 15:04.855
Why do you think none of
my marriages worked out?

15:04.957 --> 15:08.158
- No one compares to her.
- Come on, Neil.

15:08.260 --> 15:09.893
This is what you do.

15:09.995 --> 15:12.380
For five minutes, they're the best
thing that ever happened to you.

15:12.390 --> 15:14.246
This is different.

15:14.256 --> 15:15.899
Look, I... I blew it

15:15.968 --> 15:18.502
with her a long time ago,
way before Greg.

15:18.512 --> 15:22.773
Amanda and I... We...
Were together once.

15:23.605 --> 15:25.075
And I was stupid.

15:25.144 --> 15:29.078
I played it off like it
didn't mean anything.

15:29.343 --> 15:32.516
Look, this time I-I don't know.
I thought her marriage was over.

15:32.551 --> 15:35.018
I was getting a second chance.

15:36.857 --> 15:38.354
Guess I was wrong.

15:39.925 --> 15:41.925
Wow.

15:42.027 --> 15:44.594
Kate said you were sensitive.

15:45.327 --> 15:46.384
What?

15:47.966 --> 15:50.767
Look, I... I want to come back to work.

15:53.105 --> 15:56.371
My father still runs the place,
and he wants you here, so...

15:56.381 --> 15:58.918
I guess I have no choice.

16:11.757 --> 16:15.091
The head of a multi-million-dollar
company has a flip phone?

16:15.101 --> 16:16.493
I've never seen him use it.

16:18.609 --> 16:20.988
Saint Mary's Cancer Center?

16:23.622 --> 16:27.192
I-is that why your dad's
handing over the company?

16:27.395 --> 16:29.077
Because he's sick?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.098
Well, I couldn't find anybody to back up

16:43.108 --> 16:44.903
Melanie Warner's claim,
but I did find out

16:44.913 --> 16:47.013
there are two ladies'
room upstairs at S.E.G.

16:47.115 --> 16:51.217
Well, we know she's lying. It's
the witness' word against hers.

16:51.319 --> 16:53.686
Right. So we have nothing.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.225
Thank you.

16:59.260 --> 17:01.594
Did you just thank me for an update?

17:02.212 --> 17:03.396
No.

17:03.894 --> 17:05.364
You're welcome.

17:05.465 --> 17:08.766
Crime lab called. John Patrick's
got something for you.

17:17.696 --> 17:21.579
Well... There you go.

17:21.648 --> 17:23.148
Dirt.

17:23.217 --> 17:24.349
Evidence.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.352
I found blood in that dirt.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.689
And since there's no pre-impact
abrasions on your vic,

17:29.791 --> 17:32.858
that blood belongs to the killer.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.481
Which means that you were right.

17:35.491 --> 17:38.397
I mean, the broken plant plus
the perimortem bruises...

17:38.466 --> 17:41.233
It indicates a struggle
at the crime scene.

17:41.302 --> 17:42.702
Tell me something I don't know.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.771
Until you can match the blood to a
person, you've given me nothing.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.170
It's my job to do the matching.
It's your job to find the person.

17:50.265 --> 17:52.158
_

18:00.106 --> 18:02.722
- What's up?
- Hey.

18:02.824 --> 18:04.890
- You talked to Patrick?
- Not yet.

18:05.306 --> 18:07.878
But I did find out
something interesting.

18:07.888 --> 18:09.962
Neil? Really?

18:10.031 --> 18:12.331
Okay, this is so none of your business.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.634
You think I want to know about that?

18:15.737 --> 18:17.370
He says he's in love with you.

18:17.438 --> 18:19.605
And I am not in love with him, okay?

18:19.707 --> 18:21.060
You sure about that?

18:21.070 --> 18:24.670
Please tell me that this is not
the reason why you came here.

18:26.214 --> 18:29.915
- I'm here about Dad.
- What, did he steal $50 million?

18:32.918 --> 18:34.153
What's wrong?

18:35.356 --> 18:36.989
I think he may have cancer.

18:38.393 --> 18:41.193
- Wait, why do you think that?
- He's got a second phone,

18:41.262 --> 18:44.697
- and a cancer center called him on it.
- Did you call them back?

18:44.766 --> 18:46.479
W-what did you find out?
What did they say?

18:46.489 --> 18:47.967
They won't say anything.

18:48.591 --> 18:50.453
The place is in Georgia.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.837
He's been going out of town a lot.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.606
He says it's for business
meetings, but...

18:53.674 --> 18:56.208
But you think he's getting treatment?

18:56.277 --> 18:58.531
And hiding it to protect us.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.258
- What's happened?
- Jennifer's gone.

19:14.662 --> 19:16.102
What do you mean, gone?

19:16.112 --> 19:17.730
She isn't answer her cell.

19:17.799 --> 19:19.899
I went to her usual meeting,
but she didn't show up.

19:20.001 --> 19:23.174
Well, maybe she's out with
friends or went to a movie.

19:23.184 --> 19:25.884
No, I tried her friends.
No one's seen her.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.267
She just relapsed,
and she's out there somewhere.

19:30.513 --> 19:31.826
What do we do?

19:38.691 --> 19:39.969
Got a sec?

19:40.365 --> 19:41.387
Yeah.

19:41.489 --> 19:43.355
I'm glad you both are here.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.990
Come on in. Sit down.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.425
You were right, Eric.

20:01.435 --> 20:04.343
I made a lot of mistakes
when you were growing up.

20:04.445 --> 20:05.945
I tried to be a good father.

20:06.047 --> 20:07.880
You are a good father.

20:08.186 --> 20:10.416
Not always.

20:11.027 --> 20:15.387
You do everything right. You work hard.
You fall in love. You get married.

20:15.490 --> 20:17.823
But sometimes, life just doesn't...

20:18.261 --> 20:20.261
work out the way you expected.

20:21.729 --> 20:23.996
Some things are better,

20:24.098 --> 20:26.707
and some things you
just don't want to see.

20:26.717 --> 20:29.067
So you don't until you're forced to.

20:30.705 --> 20:34.039
With your mother,
I-I just didn't want to face

20:34.049 --> 20:38.277
what was right in front
of me, and I'm sorry.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.113
I'm so sorry to all of you.

20:44.968 --> 20:46.836
Thank you, Dad.

20:50.725 --> 20:52.267
Now, even though you kids are grown,

20:52.277 --> 20:55.677
I'm just trying to stop you
from making my mistakes.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.598
When I questioned Kate's intentions,

21:00.145 --> 21:02.034
I was just being protective.

21:05.479 --> 21:07.594
You... you still are.

21:19.654 --> 21:23.722
You got a call from Saint
Mary's Cancer Center.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.024
Dad...

21:28.095 --> 21:30.229
do you have cancer?

21:30.689 --> 21:31.964
W-what?

21:32.066 --> 21:33.999
Do I have cancer?

21:34.009 --> 21:36.335
Oh, the phone. No, I found
the phone in the bathroom,

21:36.437 --> 21:38.563
and I'm holding onto it until
May can locate the owner.

21:38.573 --> 21:40.506
No. Do I have cancer?

21:40.608 --> 21:43.075
- Oh, thank god.
- Oh.

21:43.144 --> 21:45.377
I didn't know what we would do.

21:45.446 --> 21:46.779
No, no.

21:46.881 --> 21:48.547
No, I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.553
Aww.

21:57.138 --> 21:59.488
May, would you come in here, please?

22:01.495 --> 22:03.182
What do you need?

22:04.425 --> 22:06.239
Did you hear something about Tricoast?

22:06.249 --> 22:07.566
No, not yet.

22:07.668 --> 22:09.034
Any news on that phone?

22:09.103 --> 22:10.269
Uh, which phone is that?

22:10.371 --> 22:13.250
Uh, the flip phone. The one my
father found in the restroom.

22:13.260 --> 22:16.273
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
what you're referring to.

22:17.353 --> 22:18.644
My mistake.

22:18.654 --> 22:20.813
Uh, I thought he spoke to you about it.

22:20.915 --> 22:22.715
- Never mind.
- Okay.

22:30.157 --> 22:31.890
Where are you?

22:51.878 --> 22:54.246
Did you kill my wife?

22:55.120 --> 22:56.548
No.

22:56.933 --> 22:59.057
No. Of... of course not.

23:03.657 --> 23:07.018
Listen, the bank called me to
follow up on your meeting.

23:07.028 --> 23:10.362
I just wanted to explain
that line of credit. Eric!

23:12.256 --> 23:13.560
Eric.

23:13.771 --> 23:17.071
- Eric, I-I'm so sorry...
- Just tell me what happened.

23:18.288 --> 23:19.513
Wow.

23:19.786 --> 23:20.973
Right to it, huh?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.152
Just like Dad.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.513
You know, y-you two are a lot alike.

23:28.217 --> 23:30.282
You set a goal, you achieve it.

23:30.586 --> 23:31.617
It's easy for you.

23:31.686 --> 23:32.985
I work hard for what I have.

23:33.054 --> 23:35.175
Yeah, and I do, too,
only things don't happen for me.

23:35.185 --> 23:36.894
I don't have your luck.

23:38.004 --> 23:39.199
My luck?

23:39.268 --> 23:40.600
My luck?

23:41.241 --> 23:44.070
Are you talking about my dead
wife, my stint in juvie,

23:44.080 --> 23:45.724
or my brother who just committed fraud

23:45.734 --> 23:47.440
and is about to destroy our company?

23:47.450 --> 23:49.643
- Eric, I...
- What happened?!

23:53.115 --> 23:55.615
I thought that I'd found
a great investment.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.388
There are six houses
and four lots available

23:58.398 --> 24:00.453
right on the course, and...
and what no one knows

24:00.555 --> 24:03.592
is the PGA is about to certify.

24:03.602 --> 24:04.711
That's confirmed?

24:04.813 --> 24:06.079
Yeah, I got a guy.

24:06.181 --> 24:07.914
Look, we're ahead of the
curve on this one, okay?

24:07.983 --> 24:09.382
In three months,

24:09.485 --> 24:11.551
the PGA makes an announcement
at a press conference,

24:11.620 --> 24:14.521
and we sell for quadruple
our investment.

24:14.623 --> 24:17.157
- That's big return.
- Yeah, and it's a sure thing.

24:17.259 --> 24:18.825
There are no sure things, Patrick.

24:18.894 --> 24:21.128
Yeah. This is.

24:21.723 --> 24:26.099
Look, I can call my guy right now,
and we can set this up.

24:29.043 --> 24:30.303
No.

24:30.405 --> 24:32.205
- What?
- This isn't what we do.

24:32.274 --> 24:35.509
We save failing companies. S.E.G.
doesn't deal in real estate.

24:35.577 --> 24:38.551
We don't. It...
it doesn't mean that we can't.

24:39.309 --> 24:41.815
When you have a company, you can.

24:43.018 --> 24:44.451
My answer is no.

24:48.724 --> 24:50.891
I knew that if you had gone to him,
he would have said yes.

24:50.993 --> 24:52.392
- Not true.
- Yes, it is.

24:52.494 --> 24:54.761
- He listens to you.
- Because I have a track record!

24:54.830 --> 24:57.964
How am I supposed to prove what I'm
capable of if I'm not given the chance?

24:58.066 --> 25:00.534
Would you stop with
the excuses, Patrick?!

25:00.636 --> 25:03.703
It's your life! The only person
that gets in your way is you!

25:03.805 --> 25:06.606
- You lied to Tricoast bank.
- No, they knew what the risk was.

25:06.616 --> 25:08.542
They... they gave me that money.
They were happy to.

25:08.644 --> 25:11.878
Then what happened?
PGA just changed their mind?

25:14.741 --> 25:17.391
They were never gonna
sanction the course.

25:18.990 --> 25:22.189
Turns out the developer
had started a rumor

25:22.291 --> 25:24.291
in order to sell properties.

25:24.301 --> 25:27.201
Everybody who bought in
went under... everyone.

25:28.138 --> 25:29.796
And then Kate found out.

25:34.768 --> 25:38.205
I know about the $12 million
line of credit at Tricoast.

25:38.735 --> 25:40.607
Uh... We...

25:41.093 --> 25:43.219
We bank with first premium.

25:43.766 --> 25:45.579
Don't lie to me.

25:45.647 --> 25:48.248
The bank statement is
locked in my desk drawer.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.417
Nobody will find it.

25:50.519 --> 25:54.020
I want to help you.
We can work this out.

25:54.289 --> 25:55.734
With Eric?

25:56.715 --> 25:58.965
For now, let's keep it between us.

26:01.630 --> 26:03.597
Thank you.

26:03.699 --> 26:06.002
Sometimes business risks don't pan out.

26:06.012 --> 26:08.535
Save it. The only reason I'm helping you

26:08.604 --> 26:11.304
is because I love Eric,
and this would kill him.

26:11.373 --> 26:13.039
With everything they do for you,

26:13.108 --> 26:16.108
how could you do this to
your brother and father?

26:18.464 --> 26:21.081
You stole the statement
out of Kate's desk.

26:21.149 --> 26:24.517
S-she was the only one who knew
about it, so I-I thought...

26:24.553 --> 26:25.719
Patrick, Patrick.

26:25.787 --> 26:29.589
You used an S.E.G.
fund to borrow $12 million.

26:29.691 --> 26:31.091
Did you really think
no one would notice?

26:31.159 --> 26:32.359
I was already fixing it.

26:32.427 --> 26:34.694
Paying down the loan before
Kate even figured out about it.

26:34.763 --> 26:36.496
How?! The properties went bust!

26:36.565 --> 26:39.165
You had... you had no assets!

26:39.660 --> 26:43.136
I...I had a buddy from school who...

26:43.760 --> 26:46.675
Well, he had money to burn. He said
he would rent out one of the houses.

26:46.685 --> 26:49.609
That's not a fix.
That's a drop in the bucket.

26:49.619 --> 26:52.712
Yeah, it wasn't enough,
but it was covering the mortgages.

26:52.781 --> 26:55.048
All right? It was only
a-a temporary plan

26:55.150 --> 26:57.717
u-until I could figure
out a better solution.

26:59.655 --> 27:01.855
I don't know that there is one.

27:02.174 --> 27:03.923
If you had stolen the
money from me or Dad,

27:03.992 --> 27:07.092
we could pay it back,
but this is bigger than that.

27:09.663 --> 27:11.164
This is fraud.

27:17.272 --> 27:18.572
I messed up.

27:20.142 --> 27:21.727
I should have come to you.

27:23.537 --> 27:24.858
I couldn't.

27:26.973 --> 27:30.373
Especially not after I saw
what's going on in that house.

27:40.896 --> 27:42.595
What's going on?

27:56.778 --> 27:58.645
What are we doing?

27:58.747 --> 28:01.047
That house, there.

28:01.149 --> 28:03.049
Yeah, what about it?

28:04.248 --> 28:06.998
There's a chance you'll
find Carly in there.

28:14.582 --> 28:16.830
- You got any cash?
- Yeah.

28:16.932 --> 28:18.264
Hang on to it.

28:22.546 --> 28:24.404
Hey, we're here to party.

28:29.578 --> 28:30.877
Come on.

28:49.837 --> 28:51.598
Do you have an appointment?

28:51.700 --> 28:53.066
I'm looking for Carly.

28:53.168 --> 28:55.090
Private party. Get the hell out.

29:00.315 --> 29:02.265
Get down on your knees. Get down.

29:02.275 --> 29:05.306
Get his weapon. Come on.
Get his gun. Get his gun.

29:05.826 --> 29:07.537
Down! Get down!

29:10.355 --> 29:12.214
I'm looking for Carly!

29:13.721 --> 29:15.586
Has anyone seen Carly?

29:16.359 --> 29:17.926
Carly! Let me see his weapon.

29:25.795 --> 29:28.332
- Carly.
- What the hell?!

29:29.358 --> 29:30.926
- Carly.
- Hey!

29:43.173 --> 29:44.773
Carly!

29:47.311 --> 29:49.277
Hey, hey!

29:51.648 --> 29:52.981
- Do you know Carly?
- No.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.716
She lives here. Carly.

29:54.785 --> 29:56.251
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.315
Come on. Carly's not here.
We got to go. Let's go.

30:05.295 --> 30:06.803
Jen?

30:07.887 --> 30:09.798
Maybe she came home.

30:09.867 --> 30:11.166
Jennifer.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.170
She's not here, Ethan.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.971
We checked all her usual spots.

30:22.270 --> 30:25.552
She's supposed to check in with her parole
officer. Maybe he'll know something.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.850
But if we call and she didn't,
then they'll send her back.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.122
I'm so sorry, Andrea.

30:34.224 --> 30:36.224
I thought that if I supported her,

30:36.293 --> 30:38.126
she'd have the strength to help herself.

30:38.136 --> 30:41.461
If she doesn't want to,
you can't make her change.

30:41.628 --> 30:45.534
Yeah, but... I didn't
have to help her fall.

30:48.290 --> 30:50.839
This time's on me.

30:53.577 --> 30:55.010
Hey, daddy.

30:55.078 --> 30:56.979
Well, this is a nice surprise.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.947
You coming from group?

30:59.016 --> 31:01.049
I got a job.

31:02.719 --> 31:03.904
A job?

31:03.914 --> 31:06.424
I know. My recovery comes first,

31:06.434 --> 31:08.801
but it's part-time in a shoe store.

31:08.903 --> 31:12.137
- I got it through my sponsor.
- Well, that's great, Jen.

31:12.561 --> 31:14.106
You're really turning things around.

31:14.175 --> 31:16.375
I couldn't have done it without you.

31:16.444 --> 31:19.044
I want to take you to
lunch to celebrate.

31:19.233 --> 31:22.674
Okay. All right,
well, I'll wash up, and we'll go.

31:23.884 --> 31:24.984
I'm proud of you.

31:35.777 --> 31:39.486
When I left the room,
she must have stolen my samples.

31:43.271 --> 31:44.536
I should have known.

31:44.605 --> 31:47.539
Last time, it was my prescription pad.

31:47.707 --> 31:49.443
Ethan.

31:50.570 --> 31:53.065
That's the hardest part. You...

31:53.496 --> 31:54.780
trusted her.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.885
A slip isn't always a relapse.

32:00.321 --> 32:02.850
Okay. Where the hell is she?

32:03.537 --> 32:05.357
Don't know.

32:05.980 --> 32:08.180
I thought she was getting better.

32:11.438 --> 32:14.265
Do you remember when I was
teaching her how to ride a bike?

32:14.275 --> 32:16.884
She fell over and over and over again.

32:18.606 --> 32:22.908
- Until she didn't.
- She had to do it her own way.

32:22.977 --> 32:27.219
I thought she was just doing
it her way, on her terms.

32:28.516 --> 32:29.982
I still see her as our little girl

32:30.051 --> 32:33.285
with her scraped knees
trying to ride that bike.

32:35.890 --> 32:38.457
You didn't do this alone, Ethan.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.880
All three of us played a part.

32:52.506 --> 32:55.441
- That was a waste of time.
- No, not entirely.

33:03.771 --> 33:05.726
So, why'd you think
Carly would be there?

33:05.736 --> 33:07.553
My brother saw her coming out.

33:07.959 --> 33:10.334
Y-your brother is a John?

33:10.344 --> 33:12.691
No, Patrick owns the house.

33:12.793 --> 33:14.326
- Patrick...
- He rents it out.

33:14.428 --> 33:16.128
He didn't know what was going on there.

33:16.230 --> 33:17.429
Right.

33:17.439 --> 33:19.932
Right. Okay, Patrick
is an idiot sometimes,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.101
but he would never do
something like this, okay?

33:22.169 --> 33:24.694
He... he found out about it a
week ago, and I believe him.

33:24.704 --> 33:27.169
No, I get it. You don't want to
think baby brother's a bad guy.

33:27.179 --> 33:28.374
Because he's not!

33:28.442 --> 33:30.042
He just got in way over his head, okay?

33:30.111 --> 33:32.988
Eric, your buddy hired a pro
to take to your company party.

33:32.998 --> 33:34.609
That girl just happens to live

33:34.619 --> 33:36.207
in the whorehouse owned by your brother?

33:36.217 --> 33:38.730
I didn't... He's lying to your face.

33:50.842 --> 33:54.266
- I need to call this in.
- Please, just wait.

33:54.335 --> 33:56.402
You get 10 more minutes.

33:56.470 --> 33:58.137
10 more minutes.

34:01.766 --> 34:04.643
- You want coffee?
- I want to put out a BOLO.

34:04.712 --> 34:08.010
We can't just send her back to jail!

34:08.020 --> 34:09.966
You think this is what I want?!

34:09.976 --> 34:11.449
I want our daughter back!

34:13.373 --> 34:15.835
She's out there somewhere.

34:15.846 --> 34:19.080
The last six years
have been a nightmare.

34:20.578 --> 34:23.509
We've done it your way
the last few hours, okay?

34:23.643 --> 34:25.010
We can't wait.

34:25.112 --> 34:27.045
I can't wait.

34:38.292 --> 34:39.891
It's an unknown number.

34:46.953 --> 34:48.634
Hello?

34:49.152 --> 34:50.482
Jennifer.

34:52.473 --> 34:54.806
Where are you, honey?

34:58.045 --> 34:59.778
We'll be right there.

35:01.282 --> 35:02.798
- Okay.
- Where is she? Where is she?

35:02.808 --> 35:05.084
She checked herself into rehab.

35:06.787 --> 35:09.088
She checked herself into rehab.

35:13.094 --> 35:14.993
Okay.

35:28.985 --> 35:30.518
She's right in here.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.319
I'll take that.

35:32.388 --> 35:35.089
Jennifer will get this back
once we go through it.

35:35.158 --> 35:37.124
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.404
I messed up.

35:50.506 --> 35:52.573
But then you made the right choice.

35:52.675 --> 35:54.308
I'm proud of you.

35:56.746 --> 36:00.461
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble. I...

36:00.629 --> 36:02.383
I don't care about that.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.220
I talked to my parole officer.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.788
You did?

36:14.385 --> 36:15.962
I'm tired.

36:18.817 --> 36:20.456
I don't want to die.

36:28.301 --> 36:34.014
And I'm not mad at you for...
For locking me up anymore.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.150
I know you have to follow the law.

36:36.858 --> 36:40.054
It wasn't about the law.

36:40.123 --> 36:43.872
I'd rather have you hate
me than to lose you.

36:46.153 --> 36:49.363
It's the only thing in
this world that scares me.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.533
It terrifies me.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.342
I didn't think you cared.

36:55.685 --> 36:57.104
Of course I care.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.555
I'm sorry I pulled away. I...

37:03.721 --> 37:07.047
Every time that you get clean
and I have hope, I'm...

37:11.521 --> 37:13.687
I'm not going anywhere.

37:20.356 --> 37:22.496
Okay.

37:22.733 --> 37:24.965
That's okay.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.901
Here's the thing, Mr. Warner...

37:26.969 --> 37:28.469
The people in the financial industry

37:28.571 --> 37:31.405
generally believe that they're special,

37:32.029 --> 37:35.843
that their legal situation is
uniquely and profoundly terrible.

37:36.877 --> 37:38.927
- But they're wrong?
- Oh, no.

37:38.967 --> 37:40.681
No, they're right.

37:40.783 --> 37:42.416
But I'm a very good lawyer.

37:42.485 --> 37:45.186
It's why people like you
need people like me.

37:45.254 --> 37:48.422
So, what are the
implications of all of this?

37:50.092 --> 37:53.360
Well, from everything
you've told me so far,

37:53.429 --> 37:57.064
and I assume there's more,
because there always is,

37:57.704 --> 38:00.301
you're looking at multiple charges.

38:01.008 --> 38:03.912
- Starting with fraud.
- That's the least of it.

38:03.922 --> 38:07.975
We're talking money laundering,
tax evasion, conspiracy...

38:08.927 --> 38:10.411
and prostitution.

38:11.015 --> 38:15.382
- I could go on.
- Just tell me exactly where we stand.

38:16.839 --> 38:19.253
I'd say the entire S.E.G.
management strata,

38:19.263 --> 38:21.622
including you, your father,
and your brother,

38:22.022 --> 38:25.159
could all be charged on multiple counts.

38:25.228 --> 38:27.602
The firm would be a thing of the past.

38:27.937 --> 38:29.964
Even worse...

38:30.032 --> 38:33.282
you could be on the hook for
some serious prison time.

38:52.184 --> 38:53.754
Don't move, Oscar.

38:55.591 --> 38:57.091
You found my wallet?

38:57.159 --> 39:01.111
I did, so I know how much
trouble you're looking at.

39:02.531 --> 39:06.133
That's a nice-looking
family you got there.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.203
I imagine the missus
would be pretty torn up

39:09.272 --> 39:12.006
to know that you've been eating out.

39:12.074 --> 39:15.809
But that's nothing compared
to what they'll say at work,

39:15.912 --> 39:18.136
Detective Reyna.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.599
What do you want?

39:23.019 --> 39:25.486
I'm looking for this girl right here.

39:25.588 --> 39:27.321
You seen her?

39:29.358 --> 39:30.824
Maybe once or twice.

39:30.927 --> 39:32.493
I'm usually preoccupied.

39:32.503 --> 39:35.361
You know, you're not giving
me a lot of options, Oscar.

39:35.371 --> 39:38.851
But if you're willing to help me out,
here's what I'll do...

39:39.344 --> 39:41.535
I won't destroy your family,

39:41.637 --> 39:44.698
and I won't get you
thrown off the force.

39:48.192 --> 39:50.197
What do you need me to do?

39:51.990 --> 39:54.715
Who runs things on Mint Hill Drive?

40:04.823 --> 40:08.329
Something new you want to accuse me of?

40:08.859 --> 40:10.397
Not today.

40:12.896 --> 40:14.868
I'm here to apologize.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.041
You okay?

40:21.388 --> 40:23.881
I haven't been okay in 19 days.

40:25.281 --> 40:28.949
My wife is gone,
my sister's marriage is over,

40:29.051 --> 40:32.419
my dad has cancer,
and my brother's in trouble.

40:32.521 --> 40:34.421
So, no, Neil.

40:34.523 --> 40:36.090
No, I'm not okay.

40:38.227 --> 40:41.061
I spoke to Patrick.

40:41.163 --> 40:43.545
I know none of this was you.

40:44.232 --> 40:46.500
I... I really was trying to protect you.

40:50.578 --> 40:51.772
From what?

40:53.542 --> 40:55.476
I needed to know.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.478
Kate had just been killed.

40:57.546 --> 40:59.246
You've been trying to
hold everything together.

40:59.348 --> 41:00.840
H-how was I supposed to tell you

41:00.850 --> 41:04.152
that your brother's
wife runs a whorehouse?

41:04.619 --> 41:06.240
What did you just say?
