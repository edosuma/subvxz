04:41.900 --> 04:43.601
When we collapsed
the corridor,

04:43.635 --> 04:47.138

nicked me.

10:38.513 --> 10:41.448
A "pocket universe,"
if you will.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.586
This is very important.

11:07.442 --> 11:11.011
many of the usual laws
of physics won't apply.

Yeah.

11:57.025 --> 11:58.593
Your eyes are

that's not important.

he made it up there.

18:40.824 --> 18:44.560
Walter's full
of surprises today.

18:48.331 --> 18:51.166
Walter!

18:54.403 --> 18:57.071
<i>Walter!</i>

18:57.106 --> 18:58.739
I thought
we were leaving.

18:58.774 --> 19:00.775
Not until I find
what I came for.

19:00.809 --> 19:03.644
For a while, I thought
this was Purgatory.

19:04.779 --> 19:08.448
What have you done
to deserve that?

19:08.482 --> 19:11.984
The apartment I was in
wasn't mine.

19:12.019 --> 19:13.419
I was stealing things.

19:13.454 --> 19:17.223
I wouldn't have
been there otherwise.

19:17.258 --> 19:18.825
What could be
worth stealing

19:18.859 --> 19:21.127
in those
bombed out apartments?

19:21.162 --> 19:24.765
They weren't bombed out
when I got there.

19:24.799 --> 19:26.700
You've been here
five days, right?

19:26.734 --> 19:28.902
Yeah.

19:28.937 --> 19:30.904
Those apartments
are condemned.

19:30.939 --> 19:33.941
<i>The building was blown up</i>
<i>20 years ago.</i>

19:33.976 --> 19:35.176
<i>What year is it?</i>

19:35.210 --> 19:37.011
It's 2016.

19:37.046 --> 19:38.880
It's 2036.

19:38.914 --> 19:42.684
What are you
talking about?

19:42.718 --> 19:45.353
Perhaps, in some way,
you are in Purgatory.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.522
This is a pocket universe.

19:47.557 --> 19:50.192
Time and space loop
in on themselves here.

19:50.226 --> 19:51.727
So you can't get out.

19:51.761 --> 19:55.797
That's why it just seemed
like days to you.

19:55.832 --> 19:58.800
My wife is waiting
for me.

19:58.835 --> 19:59.868
Not anymore.

19:59.903 --> 20:02.404
Let's go.

20:09.713 --> 20:12.548
Look at these footprints.
He was here.

20:15.485 --> 20:17.319
<i>He must have gone</i>
<i>into the pocket.</i>

20:17.353 --> 20:20.855
<i>Kick out 90 degrees</i>
<i>to the right.</i>

20:20.890 --> 20:22.557
<i>There's only one way</i>
<i>to find out.</i>

20:22.591 --> 20:24.592
<i>2 meters,</i>

20:24.626 --> 20:27.661
<i>and then to the left.</i>

20:27.696 --> 20:31.698
<i>And pivot 210 degrees</i>
<i>to the left.</i>

20:31.733 --> 20:36.370
<i>And step out.</i>

20:50.786 --> 20:52.620
<i>Donald, how are we doing?</i>

20:52.654 --> 20:53.855
<i>Am I in focus?</i>

20:53.889 --> 20:55.856
<i>Not yet.</i>

20:55.891 --> 20:58.292
I'll wait.

20:58.326 --> 20:59.727
<i>Look at this.</i>

20:59.761 --> 21:01.429
<i>Back in the lab,</i>
<i>it went to black.</i>

21:01.463 --> 21:02.997
<i>It was the end of the tape.</i>
<i>We're ready.</i>

21:03.031 --> 21:04.098
<i>And now there's more footage.</i>

21:04.132 --> 21:06.734
Well, how is
that possible?

21:06.768 --> 21:09.903
You are now
in the pocket universe.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.504
Don't be alarmed.

21:11.539 --> 21:14.775
You will notice that things
work differently here.

21:14.809 --> 21:18.612
You'll see a door.

21:18.646 --> 21:20.781
Go through it.

21:20.816 --> 21:22.516
You'll see a long hallway.

21:22.551 --> 21:23.985
Turn...
<i>Left, Walter.</i>

21:24.019 --> 21:27.255
<i>Left. Thank you, Donald.</i>

21:46.542 --> 21:48.476
Looks like something
Walter would've designed

21:48.511 --> 21:50.145
when he was tripping.

21:51.547 --> 21:53.548
Follow me.

21:53.583 --> 21:57.152
<i>What you're about to find</i>
<i>is very important.</i>

22:03.026 --> 22:05.594
Captain Windmark,

22:05.629 --> 22:08.264
I've just
been alerted.

22:08.298 --> 22:10.667
Walter Bishop has been sighted
in quadrant 9.

22:12.536 --> 22:13.670
You are certain.

22:13.704 --> 22:17.440
Yes.

22:29.019 --> 22:32.450
<i>Now, reaching the hallway,</i>
<i>turn right.</i>

22:32.650 --> 22:35.018
<i>Not left.</i>

22:35.052 --> 22:39.355
If you continue on to where
the hall you're in dead-ends,

22:39.389 --> 22:43.158
you will find that it's
not a dead end at all.

22:43.193 --> 22:44.226
<i>Are you getting this,</i>
<i>Donald?</i>

22:44.260 --> 22:46.027
<i>Yes, Walter.</i>

22:46.062 --> 22:47.596
<i>Because it doesn't look</i>
<i>like the camera's recording.</i>

22:47.630 --> 22:48.864
<i>It's fine, Walter.</i>

22:48.898 --> 22:50.765
<i>But the light's</i>
<i>not on.</i>

22:50.799 --> 22:53.668
He's right.
<i>Wait, no, now it is on.</i>

22:59.509 --> 23:01.910
This way.

23:01.944 --> 23:03.712
<i>Walter, wait.</i>

23:03.746 --> 23:05.514
<i>What's wrong?</i>

23:05.548 --> 23:07.649
<i>Why aren't you coming?</i>

23:07.683 --> 23:12.353
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

23:12.388 --> 23:13.922
Are you afraid?

23:13.956 --> 23:15.156
<i>They're not alone.</i>

23:15.191 --> 23:17.258
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

23:17.293 --> 23:18.918
He's talking 
to somebody else.

23:18.943 --> 23:20.628
It's someone
besides Donald?

23:20.629 --> 23:22.397
Yeah, look.
His eye line is different.

23:22.431 --> 23:25.366
<i>Through the looking-glass,</i>
<i>and what Alice found there?</i>

23:25.401 --> 23:29.870
<i>This place is like that.</i>

23:29.905 --> 23:33.073
Walter!

23:35.210 --> 23:36.877
There's nothing
in there.

23:36.912 --> 23:40.281
Walter.

23:40.315 --> 23:41.482
Olivia...

23:41.517 --> 23:42.984
<i>Peter.</i>

23:43.018 --> 23:44.585
Wait there.

23:44.620 --> 23:47.188
Walter.

23:47.222 --> 23:51.225
You know you're not supposed
to leave the lab alone.

23:51.259 --> 23:52.693
I'm so sorry.

23:52.727 --> 23:54.395
I don't understand.

23:54.429 --> 23:55.697
All I thought about

23:55.731 --> 23:57.265
was retrieving what was
on that tape.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.201
<i>I couldn't think</i>
<i>about anything else.</i>

23:59.235 --> 24:03.672
All I cared about was finding
the next piece of the plan.

24:07.143 --> 24:08.777
Is that Donald, Walter?

24:08.812 --> 24:11.447
No, it's
collateral damage.

24:11.481 --> 24:13.449
That's Cecil.

24:13.483 --> 24:15.684
He is completely irrelevant
to the plan!

24:15.719 --> 24:17.153
So what's he doing here?

24:17.187 --> 24:18.387
He ended up here

24:18.422 --> 24:19.755
through a series
of unfortunate events.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.891
He was blown here
by an explosion.

24:21.926 --> 24:23.426
When?

24:23.460 --> 24:24.594
20 years ago,

24:24.628 --> 24:26.062
but for him,
it's only been days.

24:26.096 --> 24:28.798
Everything within this pocket
wraps in on itself,

24:28.832 --> 24:30.567
including time.

24:30.601 --> 24:32.702
That's why we have
to hurry

24:32.736 --> 24:34.737
and find whatever
it is I hid here.

24:34.771 --> 24:37.039
Walter!

24:37.073 --> 24:39.208
There's more on the tape.

24:39.242 --> 24:42.744
You can't see it
until you enter the pocket.

24:44.647 --> 24:46.147
Of course.

24:46.181 --> 24:48.649
The time anomalies
wouldn't allow the camera

24:48.684 --> 24:49.684
to operate properly.

24:49.718 --> 24:51.085
Let me see.

24:53.888 --> 24:57.224
The key is... to know
what you're looking for.

24:57.258 --> 25:00.927
In this case,
we're looking for the apple.

25:00.962 --> 25:03.030
The forbidden fruit.

25:03.064 --> 25:06.833
The root
of all knowledge.

25:08.502 --> 25:11.371
It will mark the place
where you'll be staying...

25:11.405 --> 25:14.474
for what, I promise,
will be a short time.

25:14.508 --> 25:18.612
And it will be
safe and comfortable,

25:18.646 --> 25:22.449
I assure you.

25:30.292 --> 25:34.361
Who is that?

25:34.396 --> 25:37.198
You honestly don't
recognize him?

25:38.801 --> 25:41.403
It must have been wiped
from my mind,

25:41.437 --> 25:43.172
like the other parts
of the plan.

25:43.206 --> 25:45.707
No, Walter, it was
a case that we worked.

25:45.742 --> 25:47.710
The boy,
he was living underground.

25:47.744 --> 25:50.546
A demolition site.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.114
Maybe Walter didn't
experience the case

25:52.149 --> 25:53.316
in the same way
that we did.

25:53.350 --> 25:56.019
Is he one of them?
An Observer?

25:56.053 --> 25:57.654
Well, at first, we thought
that he was just a boy.

25:57.688 --> 26:01.958
But then he started
to exhibit empathic abilities.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.860
<i>He helped us find</i>
<i>a murderer.</i>

26:03.894 --> 26:07.164
An empath.
Remarkable.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.666
Why would I need
an empath?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.134
I don't know.

26:10.168 --> 26:15.005
<i>It was</i>
<i>20 years ago.</i>

26:15.040 --> 26:16.640
But not for him.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.809
Like Cecil,

26:18.844 --> 26:21.746
to him, he's only been waiting
for days.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.583
Like I said
on the tape,

26:25.617 --> 26:27.852
we used this place
to hide him,

26:27.886 --> 26:29.720
to keep him safe

26:29.755 --> 26:31.222
until someone could return
for him.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.091
Press play,
Peter.

26:33.126 --> 26:34.192
Show me more.

26:34.227 --> 26:35.260
We're nearly there.

26:35.294 --> 26:38.097
Now we're looking for an apple.

26:38.131 --> 26:40.866
This one.
What's that, Donald?

26:40.901 --> 26:45.839
These markings
are very strange.

26:45.873 --> 26:47.140
Of all the things
we've seen in here, Walter,

26:47.174 --> 26:51.945
<i>that's</i> what you find strange?

26:51.979 --> 26:55.915
There's the hand.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.984
<i>well, I wonder</i>
<i>where it could be?</i>

26:59.019 --> 27:00.753
Would it be--
oh.

27:00.787 --> 27:05.191
Oh-ho!
Here we are!

27:05.225 --> 27:07.059
There it is.

27:07.094 --> 27:08.861
<i>Oh, just wait here now.</i>

27:08.895 --> 27:12.398
<i>Donald, please.</i>

27:19.573 --> 27:21.808
Here it is.

27:35.490 --> 27:38.291
<i>He's not here.</i>

27:38.326 --> 27:40.593
<i>Where is he?</i>

27:40.628 --> 27:42.261
Where is he?

27:54.850 --> 27:58.820
We designed this room
just for you.

27:58.854 --> 28:00.689
You must stay here

28:00.723 --> 28:04.694
and wait for us
to return and get you.

28:04.728 --> 28:08.731
Oh, for us, it could be
quite a long time, but...

28:08.765 --> 28:13.669
for you, it will seem
like no time at all.

28:33.190 --> 28:36.193
Now you see
where we've kept him.

28:36.227 --> 28:38.830
To understand his purpose,

28:38.864 --> 28:40.632
refer to tape eight.

28:40.666 --> 28:43.501
<i>You definitely left him here.</i>

28:44.570 --> 28:47.005
<i>Maybe Donald moved him.</i>

28:47.040 --> 28:49.575
<i>It</i> has <i>been 20 years.</i>

28:49.609 --> 28:51.210
Walter...

28:51.244 --> 28:54.046
I think this is a portable
air-degradation unit.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.215
So he--
he was an Observer.

28:56.249 --> 29:00.453
What difference
does it make?

29:00.487 --> 29:01.954
He's gone.

29:01.988 --> 29:04.223
<i>Do you understand?</i>

29:04.257 --> 29:06.759
He was a part
of the plan somehow.

29:06.793 --> 29:08.294
And without all of the parts,

29:08.328 --> 29:10.195
the plan is useless!

29:10.230 --> 29:11.897
- Walter, calm down.
- No, it's too late!

29:13.700 --> 29:15.100
They must have gotten this
out of my mind.

29:15.135 --> 29:16.969
<i>Windmark!</i>

29:17.003 --> 29:21.674
He must have found the boy!

29:21.709 --> 29:26.445
Everything we've done
is for nothing!

29:26.480 --> 29:29.515
It's for nothing.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.485
Walter?

30:06.754 --> 30:10.656
Search parameters
remain the same.

30:10.690 --> 30:13.292
Building to building...

30:13.326 --> 30:15.460
door to door.

30:15.495 --> 30:17.629
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Come with me.</i>

30:17.664 --> 30:21.700
There you are.

30:28.842 --> 30:31.977
If the Observers had known
about this pocket,

30:32.012 --> 30:35.448
they would have shut it down
a long time ago.

30:37.818 --> 30:39.352
The only person
other than you

30:39.386 --> 30:41.687
that knew this place existed
and how to navigate it

30:41.722 --> 30:43.289
is Donald.

30:47.228 --> 30:50.898
That makes sense.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.266
But why would he
move the boy?

30:56.037 --> 30:57.604
I don't know.

30:57.639 --> 31:00.374
Maybe he thinks
you're dead.

31:00.408 --> 31:02.576
We were missing
for a long time.

31:02.611 --> 31:06.180
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>who Donald is,</i>

31:06.215 --> 31:09.617
<i>where you met him,</i>
<i>nothing?</i>

31:09.651 --> 31:12.753
No.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.255
<i>We have</i>
<i>to find him.</i>

31:14.289 --> 31:16.190
Donald.
Whoever he is.

31:16.224 --> 31:18.359
It's the only way
we'll ever know for sure.

31:20.863 --> 31:21.929
Walter, Peter?

31:21.964 --> 31:26.000
I think
I've got something.

31:30.572 --> 31:32.373
<i>It's not there.</i>

31:32.407 --> 31:34.575
Did you see this radio
anywhere in that room?

31:34.609 --> 31:36.143
No.
No.

31:36.178 --> 31:38.646
I think whoever took the boy
left this behind.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.515
Purposely?
Mm-hmm.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.920
Batteries must be dead.

31:45.954 --> 31:48.923
Or it doesn't work
in this pocket.

31:48.957 --> 31:51.992
<i>Like the video camera,</i>
<i>things work differently here.</i>

31:52.027 --> 31:53.761
- So once we get it outside...
<i>-  Of course.</i>

31:53.795 --> 31:55.429
That's brilliant, Olivia.

31:55.464 --> 32:00.101
And perhaps it will
somehow help us get to Donald.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.670
Assuming he's still alive.

32:02.704 --> 32:04.104
So should we get
out of here?

32:04.139 --> 32:07.809
Please.

32:21.824 --> 32:23.992
Oh, come on, guys.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.160
Oh!

32:40.842 --> 32:49.082
♪ ♪

32:58.525 --> 33:00.259
Walter, we have
to move.

33:08.634 --> 33:09.667
Back down the stairs.

33:09.702 --> 33:11.703
Go. Go!

33:14.473 --> 33:15.774
Stop.

33:15.808 --> 33:19.510
This way.

33:40.599 --> 33:41.566
That's it.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.370
You found it, Peter.

33:53.212 --> 33:58.117
Olivia, cross right here.

34:12.433 --> 34:16.436
You okay?

34:16.469 --> 34:19.205
Yeah.

34:46.967 --> 34:48.434
Olivia, move.

34:48.467 --> 34:50.703
There's no time.
Get Walter out of here.

34:50.737 --> 34:53.371
I'll draw them off and meet you
at the monorail.

34:53.407 --> 34:56.041
<i>Go!</i>

34:56.076 --> 34:58.114
Oh!

35:55.411 --> 35:58.747
I know
what you have done.

36:01.623 --> 36:04.625
You have made
a grave mistake.

36:04.659 --> 36:07.828
You do not realize
what is happening to you.

36:34.823 --> 36:35.856
They usually have a--

36:35.890 --> 36:37.858
<i>the doors are closing.</i>

36:39.394 --> 36:40.961
<i>Yeah, I think that'll work,</i>
<i>thank you.</i>

36:40.995 --> 36:43.062
<i>Oh, that's mine.</i>

36:43.097 --> 36:44.197
<i>Clear the walkway.</i>

36:44.231 --> 36:45.164
Walter, he's not coming.

36:45.199 --> 36:48.001
We got to go back
for him.

36:49.536 --> 36:51.637
Peter.

36:54.875 --> 36:55.841
How'd you do that?

36:55.875 --> 36:57.309
Do what?

36:57.344 --> 36:59.378
Get us out of there?

36:59.412 --> 37:03.248
How'd you find your way back
to the portal?

37:03.282 --> 37:05.417
I don't know,
but I'll take it.

37:05.452 --> 37:10.256
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

37:30.576 --> 37:32.444
What's wrong?

37:32.478 --> 37:35.847
<i>This radio was left for us</i>
<i>in the pocket universe.</i>

37:35.882 --> 37:38.817
Look, the tuning dial
has been jammed.

37:38.852 --> 37:41.186
It's, like, stuck
on one frequency.

37:41.221 --> 37:43.021
Why?

37:43.056 --> 37:46.158
Nothing's
being transmitted.

37:46.192 --> 37:50.429
Not yet.

37:56.269 --> 37:59.939
You okay, Walter?

38:02.442 --> 38:05.778
I can't stop thinking
about that man.

38:09.849 --> 38:15.554
All he wanted
was to get out of there.

38:15.588 --> 38:19.491
And I didn't help him.

38:19.526 --> 38:23.362
I didn't care
about him.

38:23.396 --> 38:25.598
All I cared about--

38:25.633 --> 38:29.202
saving the world.

38:29.237 --> 38:31.738
Walter.

38:31.773 --> 38:36.543
You are not responsible
for that man's death.

38:36.577 --> 38:40.146
He died 20 years ago,

38:40.180 --> 38:41.881
the night he broke
into that apartment

38:41.916 --> 38:45.185
and the light bomb went off.

38:45.219 --> 38:47.787
If it wasn't
for your pocket,

38:47.822 --> 38:50.190
he would have died
then and there.

38:50.224 --> 38:54.160
Perhaps.

38:54.195 --> 38:58.165
I saw a man...

38:58.199 --> 39:02.269
half-starved.

39:02.303 --> 39:05.106
And I used him

39:05.140 --> 39:09.878
because it suited me.

39:09.912 --> 39:13.348
Because he was
nothing more

39:13.382 --> 39:16.752
than an acceptable loss

39:16.786 --> 39:19.988
as long as I got
what I needed.

39:25.261 --> 39:29.031
Is that who I am,
Peter?

39:30.867 --> 39:34.971
Is that something
you can see

39:35.005 --> 39:37.307
coming from my mind?

39:37.341 --> 39:40.977
From my heart?

39:41.012 --> 39:44.114
Am I the person
that would...

39:44.148 --> 39:46.049
leave in the middle
of the night

39:46.083 --> 39:48.619
on his own?
Walter.

39:48.653 --> 39:52.823
Those are the actions
of a man of hubris, arrogance.

39:52.858 --> 39:56.193
And that's not me,
Peter.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.861
It's him.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.723
Him?

40:02.801 --> 40:05.369
Don't you see?

40:07.939 --> 40:11.842
I'm not safe.

40:20.219 --> 40:25.090
It's my mind.

40:25.124 --> 40:27.358
Ever since the pieces
of my brain

40:27.392 --> 40:31.962
were reimplanted,

40:31.997 --> 40:36.968
it's been changing... me...

40:39.038 --> 40:42.841
Back into the man
I was before.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.244
Bit by bit.

40:46.279 --> 40:50.850
I'm losing myself,
Pete.

40:50.884 --> 40:56.288
I'm losing the man
that you helped me become.

40:56.323 --> 40:59.492
Listen to me.

40:59.526 --> 41:04.096
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

41:04.131 --> 41:07.566
We need you.

41:07.601 --> 41:11.303
You are our only hope
to defeat the Observers.

41:14.041 --> 41:15.741
And I'm gonna be here
with you,

41:15.776 --> 41:20.480
every step
of the way.

41:20.514 --> 41:23.817
Please, son,

41:23.851 --> 41:28.955
whatever happens,

41:28.990 --> 41:34.127
don't let me go.

41:36.531 --> 41:40.133
I won't, Dad.

41:40.168 --> 41:43.671
I promise.
