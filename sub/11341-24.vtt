00:06.387 --> 00:08.480
A good friend of mine,
sheriff Peter Coleman,

00:08.505 --> 00:10.517
down in Briscoe county,
Texas, reached out to me

00:10.542 --> 00:11.617
about a possible case.

00:11.642 --> 00:14.295
The same unsub
killed one John and two prostitutes.

00:15.303 --> 00:17.007
If you can't make sure
my bitches are safe,

00:17.032 --> 00:17.838
then what good are you?

00:17.863 --> 00:19.981
Before he was Justin Mills,
he was Gordon Borell,

00:20.006 --> 00:22.744
and he was arrested for cutting
one of the ladies he employed.

00:22.769 --> 00:25.562
But you said the unsub wanted us
to catch him and punish him.

00:25.689 --> 00:28.274
What he really wanted
was for us to catch the preacher.

00:28.276 --> 00:30.259
We need to tell him
we know he didn't do this.

00:30.261 --> 00:32.812
Oh, preacher, what have you
gotten yourself into?

00:37.117 --> 00:39.068
Shots fired! Shots fired!

00:42.572 --> 00:43.823
Blake!

00:43.825 --> 00:45.274
Uhh!

00:45.276 --> 00:46.441

We need a medic now!

02:14.715 --> 02:17.199
There's too much blood!

02:17.201 --> 02:18.167
Hey.

02:18.169 --> 02:20.702
Hey, you're doing great,
all right?

02:20.704 --> 02:23.555
Yeah. You gotta stay
right here, ok?

02:23.557 --> 02:26.258
Eyes on me.
Eyes on me.

02:26.260 --> 02:28.060
Yeah.

02:29.896 --> 02:31.513
No, no. No.

02:31.515 --> 02:33.599
Ethan? Ethan!

02:33.601 --> 02:37.186
Open your eyes.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.404
Hurry!

02:38.406 --> 02:40.439
Hurry!

04:55.191 --> 04:57.526
Suspect is down.
Repeat, suspect is down.

04:57.528 --> 04:59.861
We got this covered.
One of yours is in bad shape.

04:59.863 --> 05:02.164
Let's go.

05:04.134 --> 05:07.586
Copy that. Two of ours, 3 of theirs.
Any casualties?

05:07.588 --> 05:09.054
One. Coleman.

05:09.056 --> 05:10.556
Coleman?

05:10.558 --> 05:12.541
And what about Reid?

05:12.543 --> 05:14.259
Not good. They're taking him
to the hospital.

05:14.261 --> 05:16.378
I'll call you back.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.547
All right, Derek, you should
go get that looked at.

05:18.549 --> 05:20.015
We'll meet you there.

05:21.017 --> 05:23.936
Fastest route to the hospital
is Highway 17.

05:23.938 --> 05:25.437
Thanks.

05:30.661 --> 05:33.445
The sound is like
a teakettle.

05:33.447 --> 05:35.697
Do you hear it?

05:35.699 --> 05:37.916
What?

05:37.918 --> 05:39.952
Reid.

05:39.954 --> 05:41.736
Pressure's dropping.

05:41.738 --> 05:43.238
Pulse is thready.
Starting large-bore I.V.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.206
Reid!

05:44.208 --> 05:46.041
Agent, you've
got to sit back.

05:46.043 --> 05:47.426
You gotta help him, man.

05:47.428 --> 05:49.928
Kid, come on, now.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.580
Stay with me.
I'm right here.

05:51.582 --> 05:53.465
Reid.

05:53.467 --> 05:54.600
Reid!

05:54.602 --> 05:56.802
Stay with me.

He'll make it.

07:54.085 --> 07:57.503
He has to.

07:57.505 --> 07:59.622
He's just--he's too young.

07:59.624 --> 08:02.809
Yeah, there's still
things for him to do.

08:05.145 --> 08:06.796
You know, he wants kids.

08:06.798 --> 08:11.267
Can you imagine Spence
as a dad?

08:12.570 --> 08:15.271
That'd be the luckiest
kid in the world.

08:15.273 --> 08:17.440
No doubt.

08:17.442 --> 08:18.408
Hey.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.443
Yeah, it turns out
you made it.

08:20.445 --> 08:21.911
We're not the only one
that's connected

08:21.913 --> 08:23.830
and he knows somebody
with plane.

08:23.832 --> 08:25.815
How is he?

08:25.817 --> 08:27.116
Still in surgery.

08:27.118 --> 08:29.118
You all can see
agent Morgan now.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.006
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd really like to stay here.

08:33.008 --> 08:37.659
The second you hear
anything, call me.

08:37.662 --> 08:39.044
Hey.

08:39.962 --> 08:41.547
I'll be right back.

08:46.837 --> 08:48.170
How's Reid?

08:48.172 --> 08:50.223
He's still in surgery.

08:51.141 --> 08:52.892
No! What are you doing?

08:52.894 --> 08:55.445
You can bet your ass I'm not
gonna just sit around here.

08:55.447 --> 08:56.779
Guys, come on,
get me out of here.

08:56.781 --> 08:58.865
Actually, you are.
Just hang on a second.

08:58.867 --> 09:00.566
Just until we figure out
what's what. Catch me up.

09:00.568 --> 09:02.735
The 3 victims inside were dead
before the shooting started.

09:02.737 --> 09:05.121
Lividity had set in
and there was no blood spatter.

09:05.123 --> 09:06.039
They weren't killed there.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.573
The preacher's car
was clean,

09:07.575 --> 09:09.158
so there's no way
he transported bodies in it.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.744
So you were right.
He was being framed. But by whom?

09:11.746 --> 09:13.246
The answer's
in the victims.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.697
Belinda Clark
and Jesse Moore

09:14.699 --> 09:16.549
were both tied
to prostitution like the others.

09:16.551 --> 09:18.217
Travis Henson was a regular
at the pool hall,

09:18.219 --> 09:19.552
but he didn't
work there.

09:19.554 --> 09:21.387
See, I don't get why
the preacher

09:21.389 --> 09:23.372
didn't just come clean
with you.

09:23.374 --> 09:25.091
He was a narcissistic
sociopath who was cornered,

09:25.093 --> 09:26.592
but he still thought that
he could get away with it.

09:26.594 --> 09:28.845
Once he started shooting,
he made his decision.

09:28.847 --> 09:30.329
Coming clean
was no longer an option.

09:30.331 --> 09:32.932
Guys, I don't think
he was the first one to shoot.

09:32.934 --> 09:34.567
Whoever set him up
was there.

09:34.569 --> 09:36.519
That's ballsy.
What makes you think that?

09:36.521 --> 09:39.355
Because I'm pretty sure that Reid
and I heard the first shots fired.

09:39.357 --> 09:42.391
We were all outside
of that diner.

09:42.393 --> 09:43.993
Anybody got any photos?

09:43.995 --> 09:46.779
Yeah. I downloaded
the crime scene photos.

09:47.781 --> 09:49.449
All right,
show me coleman.

09:49.451 --> 09:51.117
Right here.

09:54.838 --> 09:56.639
Where's my vest? I want
to show you something.

10:04.298 --> 10:05.548
All right.

10:05.550 --> 10:06.682
You see these?

10:06.684 --> 10:08.017
That's from a Mac-10.

10:08.019 --> 10:09.268
Now look at this.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.771
You see how the impact
mushrooms out?

10:11.773 --> 10:14.089
That's from a semi-jacketed
hydroshock round.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.559
It makes a high-pitched
scream. And I know that I heard it.

10:16.561 --> 10:17.810
That's law
enforcement issue.

10:17.812 --> 10:18.945
Friendly fire?

10:18.947 --> 10:20.480
No. All those cops

10:20.482 --> 10:21.781
were shooting
into the diner.

10:21.783 --> 10:23.766
The round came from
the same direction as the preacher.

10:23.768 --> 10:26.285
Ok, I don't know
who shot first,

10:26.287 --> 10:28.621
but I do know that every victim's
connected to the pool hall.

10:28.623 --> 10:30.456
The only one missing
is Dinah.

10:30.458 --> 10:31.824
Go find her.

10:55.015 --> 10:56.315
What are you doing, Dinah?

10:56.317 --> 10:58.184
Come on, Owen.

10:58.186 --> 10:59.819
Just let me be.

10:59.821 --> 11:01.804
I'm not stubborn
like the preacher.

11:01.806 --> 11:03.990
I won't give you
any trouble.

11:03.992 --> 11:05.491
You know I ain't
gonna say nothin'.

11:05.493 --> 11:06.642
Oh, I know
you better not.

11:06.644 --> 11:07.777
Ohh!

11:07.779 --> 11:09.612
Please.

11:09.614 --> 11:11.981
Owen, I won't tell anyone.

11:11.983 --> 11:14.283
I swear.

11:14.285 --> 11:15.284
Let's go. Come on.

11:15.286 --> 11:16.652
Ok. Ok, ok, ok.

11:16.654 --> 11:17.870
Move it.

11:39.009 --> 11:40.226
Agent.

11:41.728 --> 11:43.012
How is he?

11:43.014 --> 11:44.780
Incredibly lucky.
Two millimeters to the right

11:44.782 --> 11:47.182
and the bullet would have torn
through the carotid artery.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.517
It nicked some
smaller vessels,

11:48.519 --> 11:50.052
but we've stopped
the bleeding.

11:50.054 --> 11:51.654
You can see him now.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.544
Hey, how is he?

11:58.546 --> 12:00.746
Great.

12:00.748 --> 12:02.364
Ok.

12:02.366 --> 12:03.549
Thanks, Alex.

12:03.551 --> 12:05.585
Bye.

12:08.805 --> 12:10.372
Spence is in recovery.

12:10.374 --> 12:11.340
Good.

12:11.342 --> 12:13.542
The kid's too smart
to die.

12:13.544 --> 12:17.179
Probably rerouted the bullets
by power of suggestion.

12:19.816 --> 12:21.717
I was scared.

12:23.570 --> 12:26.439
Yeah, I was, too.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.358
Well, it looks like
she packed a few things

12:29.360 --> 12:31.077
before someone forced
their way in here.

12:31.079 --> 12:32.662
Truck's still out front.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.197
She strike you
as the mothering type?

12:35.199 --> 12:36.666
Well, if you pay her
for it. Why?

12:36.668 --> 12:38.367
She has this framed.

12:38.369 --> 12:40.453
It was in the bottom
of her bag,

12:40.455 --> 12:43.289
so that probably means it was
one of the first things she packed.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.407
It must be very
important to her.

12:47.595 --> 12:49.987
Yeah, Hotch. She's gone,

12:50.012 --> 12:51.965
but it doesn't look like
she went willingly.

12:51.966 --> 12:53.015
No, she didn't.

12:53.017 --> 12:54.517
Meet us at the station.

12:54.519 --> 12:56.585
Right.

13:07.097 --> 13:09.765
Where did you guys
find her?

13:09.767 --> 13:11.450
Trying to get out
of town.

13:11.452 --> 13:13.953
Deputy McGregor found her
flying down Route 13.

13:13.955 --> 13:16.289
When he pulled her over,
she resisted arrest.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.790
I'd like to talk
to deputy McGregor.

13:17.792 --> 13:20.710
Well, he's back out there.
What do you need to know?

13:20.712 --> 13:23.112
What was she driving?

13:23.114 --> 13:26.132
He didn't say. Her
truck, I presume. Why?

13:26.134 --> 13:27.083
Just curious.

13:27.085 --> 13:28.334
Well, it doesn't
matter much.

13:28.336 --> 13:29.802
It looks like
we got her now.

13:29.804 --> 13:31.286
She's gotta be
behind all this.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.306
Probably got tired
of the preacher controlling her

13:33.308 --> 13:34.790
and pulled a power play.

13:34.792 --> 13:37.310
I'm sure you guys
have a proper word

13:37.312 --> 13:38.627
for that kind
of behavior.

13:38.629 --> 13:40.796
Devious.

13:42.316 --> 13:44.684
Excuse me, folks.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.106
Dinah's truck
was still at her place.

13:50.108 --> 13:52.307
We need to talk to her.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.827
Happy to do it.

13:58.665 --> 14:00.816
Hi, Dinah.

14:00.818 --> 14:03.652
Sometimes investigators

14:03.654 --> 14:06.488
suffer from a form
of tunnel vision.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.624
Especially when one of
their own gets killed.

14:08.626 --> 14:10.426
They stop asking
questions

14:10.428 --> 14:13.963
and start to frame
the case around their theory.

14:13.965 --> 14:16.849
Do you know
what they think?

14:16.851 --> 14:19.668
They think that
you did all of it,

14:19.670 --> 14:22.605
not just the preacher,
but the sheriff

14:22.607 --> 14:25.274
and all of the girls, too.

14:25.276 --> 14:27.276
But here's the thing.

14:27.278 --> 14:30.196
I don't think you wanted
those girls to die.

14:30.198 --> 14:33.899
And you were scared
for those girls.

14:33.901 --> 14:36.285
Because you were
one of them.

14:36.287 --> 14:38.487
Weren't you?

14:38.489 --> 14:42.691
Dinah, you can tell me
whatever it is you are afraid of.

14:42.693 --> 14:44.076
I will protect you.

14:44.078 --> 14:46.712
You can protect me?

14:46.714 --> 14:49.165
We have federal
jurisdiction.

14:53.754 --> 14:55.704
Who was the little boy

14:55.706 --> 14:57.873
in the picture frame?

14:57.875 --> 15:00.559
He's like 7 years old?

15:05.933 --> 15:08.884
You're wasting your time.

15:08.886 --> 15:11.153
I got nothin'
to say to you.

15:11.155 --> 15:12.988
With all due respect,
agent,

15:12.990 --> 15:14.907
she's here under resisting
arrest charges,

15:14.909 --> 15:17.443
and my guess is there's
a hell of a lot more that'll stick.

15:17.445 --> 15:19.829
See? Tunnel vision.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.831
The thing about tunnels--

15:21.833 --> 15:23.899
they can get real dark
real fast.

15:23.901 --> 15:26.902
I'm gonna take care
of my case now.

15:26.904 --> 15:30.206
So if you don't mind...

15:32.242 --> 15:33.592
Ok.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.931
Well,
she's definitely afraid,

15:38.933 --> 15:41.300
but got defiant
when Bennett walked in.

15:41.302 --> 15:42.968
You get anything
about the kid?

15:42.970 --> 15:44.603
Nothing but a look
of desperation.

15:44.605 --> 15:47.422
If she has someone to lose,
they hold all the cards.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.475
Outside.

15:51.478 --> 15:53.779
So Garcia did some digging

15:53.781 --> 15:56.282
and it turns out that Travis Henson,
the third victim from the diner,

15:56.284 --> 15:57.817
was also a confidential
informant.

15:57.819 --> 15:59.285
For coleman?
No.

15:59.287 --> 16:01.704
For a decorated deputy
named Owen McGregor.

16:01.706 --> 16:03.789
You mean the same deputy
who arrested Dinah

16:03.791 --> 16:05.574
but didn't stick around
to book her?

16:05.576 --> 16:09.444
It explains the hydroshock
rounds found in Coleman

16:09.446 --> 16:10.963
and why all the victims
were afraid.

16:10.965 --> 16:13.448
Each one reported
"they" were gonna get them.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.385
What if "they" is more than
just this Owen McGregor?

16:16.387 --> 16:18.954
What if it's
the whole force?

16:18.956 --> 16:21.456
I'm telling you, Coleman
was not a dirty cop.

16:21.458 --> 16:24.459
No, but he's only been
sheriff for a year.

16:24.461 --> 16:27.462
So he's the outsider.
That's what got him killed.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.632
It's a massive body count.
What the hell are they protecting?

16:30.634 --> 16:32.601
A way of life?
Corruption like this

16:32.603 --> 16:34.270
can make a lot of people
a lot of money.

16:34.272 --> 16:36.522
And you never met
this McGregor?

16:36.524 --> 16:39.191
He'd just finished
his 4/40 when we landed.

16:39.193 --> 16:40.976
Convenient.

16:40.978 --> 16:43.412
He's back
on the clock now.

16:43.414 --> 16:44.814
Where would he go?

16:46.482 --> 16:48.817
Bad news. That agent's
gonna make it.

16:48.819 --> 16:49.985
You need my help?

16:49.987 --> 16:51.670
No.

16:51.672 --> 16:53.989
I'll take care of it.

16:58.128 --> 17:01.514
It'll be so great
if he wakes up...

17:01.516 --> 17:05.099
And this is the first
thing he sees.

17:05.102 --> 17:06.301
Yeah.

17:06.304 --> 17:10.890
The good doctor will
always make him smile.

17:16.012 --> 17:18.680
It'd be really great
if he wakes up

17:18.682 --> 17:20.031
and we're all--ooh--
staring at him.

17:20.034 --> 17:22.734
So, I'm gonna go
stand over here.

18:06.778 --> 18:08.963
What's wrong?

18:08.965 --> 18:11.415
Trust no one,
my friend.

18:11.417 --> 18:12.800
Why?

18:12.802 --> 18:14.168
Corruption.

18:14.170 --> 18:16.754
Something this organized
needs a strong leader.

18:16.756 --> 18:18.789
We think it's deputy
Owen McGregor.

18:18.791 --> 18:22.093
And there's a second-in-command
who appears trustworthy

18:22.095 --> 18:24.929
but has the access and the skill set
to do a lot of damage.

18:24.931 --> 18:26.931
Deputy Bennett
is presenting as that.

18:26.933 --> 18:28.666
They framed
the preacher and Dinah.

18:28.668 --> 18:30.968
She's still alive
and terrified.

18:30.970 --> 18:33.470
She ran the prostitution ring
with the preacher,

18:33.472 --> 18:36.140
but she must play
a bigger part in the rest of this.

18:36.142 --> 18:38.192
She's clearly
worth more alive than dead.

18:38.194 --> 18:39.293
For now.

18:39.295 --> 18:41.812
We could offerer
something,

18:41.814 --> 18:43.314
get her to trust us.

18:43.316 --> 18:44.665
We've seen this before.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.817
We find her kid
and maybe she'll talk.

18:46.819 --> 18:48.703
Let's see if Garcia
can find him.

18:48.705 --> 18:53.207
The rest of us need
to figure out who else is involved.

18:56.713 --> 18:57.828
Hey, Garcia.

18:57.830 --> 19:00.047
Hi. I found juice,
broth, and jell-o.

19:00.049 --> 19:01.999
Super bland, but he
needs the calories.

19:02.001 --> 19:06.387
When this comes off,
I'm gonna look just like Boris Karloff.

19:06.389 --> 19:07.772
Yeah. A little
green makeup

19:07.774 --> 19:10.274
and you'll have the best
Halloween mask ever.

19:24.373 --> 19:27.041
Everybody's fine.
Don't worry.

19:27.043 --> 19:28.292
I'm not.

19:28.294 --> 19:30.127
You've got that
furrowed brow.

19:30.129 --> 19:32.246
Hey, hey, hey.

19:32.248 --> 19:33.831
Will you look
who's still awake.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.550
Can you tell her
she can go now, please?

19:35.552 --> 19:38.002
I'm ok, Alex.
Go help the team.

19:38.004 --> 19:40.704
All right.
I'm out of here.

19:40.706 --> 19:42.373
I'm glad you're awake.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.008
Thank you.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.760
Ok.

19:46.595 --> 19:48.763
Juice, broth,

19:48.765 --> 19:50.714
or jell-o!

19:50.716 --> 19:53.184
Jell-o, my favorite.

19:53.186 --> 19:55.987
You guys were out there
a long time.

19:55.989 --> 19:57.738
Anything we should
know about?

19:57.740 --> 19:59.907
Just getting some fresh air.

19:59.909 --> 20:02.393
Ok.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.018
Dinah didn't claim
any dependents

20:11.020 --> 20:13.004
when she filed
her tax returns.

20:13.006 --> 20:15.339
Bonus points for checking in
with Uncle Sam.

20:15.341 --> 20:17.008
At least that part
of her life's in order.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.377
She's from around her.
Mom lives 10 miles away.

20:19.379 --> 20:21.045
Uh...

20:22.547 --> 20:24.015
This is weird.

20:24.017 --> 20:26.934
Her mom has a first-grader
enrolled at Buckingham elementary.

20:26.936 --> 20:29.604
What are the chances
a 78-year old has a first-grader?

20:29.606 --> 20:31.272
What's his name?
Josh.

20:31.274 --> 20:32.890
I'm sending all
the information out.

20:32.892 --> 20:34.191
All right, thanks, Garcia.

20:37.896 --> 20:39.596
Hey.

20:39.598 --> 20:40.982
Eat that.

20:40.984 --> 20:44.402
So Garcia tracked down
Dinah's son,

20:44.404 --> 20:47.371
who's living close to here,
but, um,

20:47.373 --> 20:49.907
I've got eyes all over me,
so someone else should go.

20:49.909 --> 20:51.375
How's Dr. Reid?

20:51.377 --> 20:53.110
He's awake.
He's gonna be fine.

20:53.112 --> 20:55.129
That's good to hear.

20:58.616 --> 20:59.750
What's wrong?

20:59.752 --> 21:02.303
Let's take a car ride.
I'll fill you in.

21:02.305 --> 21:04.005
JJ, send us the info.

21:04.007 --> 21:05.622
Will do.

21:12.014 --> 21:14.649
We knew Coleman had
only been here a year,

21:14.651 --> 21:17.685
but get this. He replaced a sheriff
who also died.

21:17.687 --> 21:19.320
Of what?

21:19.322 --> 21:20.804
Allergic reaction
to medication.

21:20.806 --> 21:22.857
He was in the hospital
recovering from a gunshot wound.

21:22.859 --> 21:24.909
Who shot him?
Got away.

21:24.911 --> 21:28.362
Report says it was a drug raid
that ended in automatic gunfire.

21:28.364 --> 21:29.664
Who wrote that report?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.533
Owen McGregor.

21:32.535 --> 21:35.319
So the old sheriff realized
that his office was corrupt.

21:35.321 --> 21:37.654
They staged a murder.
That sounds familiar.

21:37.656 --> 21:41.342
Then if the prostitutes
witnessed it and threatened to tell,

21:41.344 --> 21:42.677
that's what
got them killed.

21:42.679 --> 21:44.345
On what date
did the sheriff die?

21:44.347 --> 21:45.546
Uh...

21:45.548 --> 21:47.515
It says here March 20,
a year ago.

21:47.517 --> 21:50.468
The same day as the first
victim Lucas Wagner.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.803
So Owen's had a whole year
to figure out his end game.

21:52.805 --> 21:54.671
It all started
on that night.

21:54.673 --> 21:57.007
You need to see if you
can get Dinah talking,

21:57.009 --> 22:00.061
and you need to find out everything
you can about Owen McGregor.

22:38.567 --> 22:39.984
What was that about?

22:39.986 --> 22:42.820
Just seeing
if she wanted to talk.

22:42.822 --> 22:46.240
A person like Dinah's
gotta have some demons.

22:46.242 --> 22:49.059
It's like she was born
into bad choices.

22:54.899 --> 22:56.417
Hello.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.226
Hey.

23:55.228 --> 23:56.510
Hey, did you get it?

23:56.512 --> 23:58.145
That's the cop
we're looking for.

23:58.147 --> 23:59.814
That way?

23:59.816 --> 24:01.932
Affirmative.

24:01.934 --> 24:04.268
He's right there,
isn't he?

24:04.270 --> 24:06.187
He's at the nurses
station.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.690
Oh, I gotta
get back to Reid.

24:09.692 --> 24:11.475
Garcia, get in that room
and shut the door.

24:21.036 --> 24:22.703
Sorry.

24:27.825 --> 24:29.627
Ok, I did that.
Now what?

24:29.629 --> 24:31.995
I need you to focus and I need you
to listen to me. Can you do that?

24:31.997 --> 24:33.430
Yes, yes, I can do that.
I can do that.

24:33.432 --> 24:34.882
Is there a wheelchair
in the room?

24:34.884 --> 24:37.101
Um...Yes.

24:37.103 --> 24:38.552
Good. Get Reid in it.

24:38.554 --> 24:39.836
That is not gonna be easy.

24:39.838 --> 24:41.939
Then get his patient bag.
His gun is in there.

24:41.941 --> 24:43.190
Oh, my God. What?

24:43.192 --> 24:46.193
I need you to get out
in that hallway.

24:46.195 --> 24:47.561
Ok.

25:00.191 --> 25:03.026
You ok?

25:03.028 --> 25:05.379
Oh, yeah.

25:05.381 --> 25:08.132
Relieved.

25:08.134 --> 25:11.135
I thought it was gonna
be the worst day.

25:11.137 --> 25:14.305
I was so afraid Reid
wasn't going to make it.

25:14.307 --> 25:15.639
Yeah, but he did.

25:15.641 --> 25:17.258
And look at us now.

25:17.260 --> 25:18.926
We're gonna go
protect a kid

25:18.928 --> 25:21.011
and give his mom
another chance.

25:21.013 --> 25:24.481
Yeah. Doesn't get
much better.

25:24.483 --> 25:27.568
Dirty cops
doesn't get much worse.

25:27.570 --> 25:31.188
It's funny about this job,
isn't it?

25:31.190 --> 25:33.857
The extremes.

25:33.859 --> 25:35.326
Yeah. Well,

25:35.328 --> 25:38.579
it's always
been that way.

25:38.581 --> 25:41.248
One of the best
days of my career

25:41.250 --> 25:43.900
turned out to be
one of the worst.

25:45.704 --> 25:48.905
July 16, 1983.

25:48.907 --> 25:51.926
Child abduction
turned murder.

25:51.928 --> 25:55.713
The guy we nabbed
killed 5 boys,

25:55.715 --> 26:00.100
and they were cases
we had already tracked.

26:00.102 --> 26:03.354
There was such a victory

26:03.356 --> 26:08.809
in knowing that we'd stopped him
from hurting anyone else.

26:08.811 --> 26:13.897
When I got home,
my bags were packed.

26:13.899 --> 26:16.817
Carolyn had had enough.

26:16.819 --> 26:19.570
I had forgotten
our anniversary

26:19.572 --> 26:21.622
again.

26:21.624 --> 26:23.290
As well as all
the other little things

26:23.292 --> 26:25.960
that didn't seem
important because...

26:25.962 --> 26:29.380
Saving lives trumped
everything.

26:29.382 --> 26:33.500
So I let ours die.

26:33.502 --> 26:36.453
That's the great balance
of life.

26:36.455 --> 26:41.291
Always finds a way
to knock your legs away.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.732
What the hell?

26:49.567 --> 26:51.685
They're headed
to get the kid.

26:51.687 --> 26:54.021
What are you talking about?
They figured it out.

26:54.023 --> 26:55.939
I knew I should have
handled this myself.

26:57.159 --> 27:00.143
If you can,
make your way to the exit.

27:00.145 --> 27:01.862
Not the elevator,
please.

27:01.864 --> 27:04.031
What do you want us
to do?

27:04.033 --> 27:06.200
What's happening?
Let's get out.

27:06.202 --> 27:08.419
Kill them.

27:30.842 --> 27:34.344
Thought you said
it doesn't get any worse.

27:34.346 --> 27:36.030
Until it does.

27:48.860 --> 27:52.362
Are they really gonna
shoot federal agents?

27:52.364 --> 27:55.382
They're cops who'd rather
die than get locked up.

27:55.384 --> 27:58.218
They're desperate.

27:59.537 --> 28:01.204
She's coming to you.

28:01.206 --> 28:04.842
Have you got one
in the chamber?

28:04.844 --> 28:06.677
Yep.

28:09.881 --> 28:11.932
Let's roll.

28:24.763 --> 28:27.431
Oh, God.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.101
They rammed us.

28:30.103 --> 28:32.737
We got off a few rounds.

28:32.739 --> 28:35.606
They got away.
We--we messed up.

28:53.458 --> 28:56.627
We got a 10-71
on Highway 17.

28:56.629 --> 28:59.797
All units respond.
We've got a 1071--

29:15.281 --> 29:18.866
The safe house
isn't too far away.

29:18.868 --> 29:20.418
And Dinah will be
waiting for us?

29:20.420 --> 29:22.537
Well, we may
get there first.

29:22.539 --> 29:26.174
Hey, Josh. Can I take
a photo for your mom?

29:26.176 --> 29:27.491
Ok.

29:27.493 --> 29:32.130
Ok. Now, you want to
give me a big smile?

29:35.417 --> 29:37.552
Great. Ok, go ahead.

29:40.889 --> 29:43.608
He's with agents now.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.143
Oh, my God.

29:45.145 --> 29:46.894
Do you agree
to cooperate?

29:46.896 --> 29:48.012
Yes.

29:48.014 --> 29:50.531
Just get me
the hell out of here.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.016
Let's go.

29:57.522 --> 30:00.908
I've got orders she's
not to leave the premises.

30:00.910 --> 30:04.128
You can tell your boss
she's leaving with me.

30:06.165 --> 30:08.883
You tell yours she's not.

30:08.885 --> 30:10.551
Let go of me.

30:10.553 --> 30:12.036
Unless you want
to be arrested for obstruction

30:12.038 --> 30:13.721
of a federal investigation,
let her go.

30:21.930 --> 30:23.431
He's gone, right?

30:23.433 --> 30:26.550
He is gone. They're
letting us back in.

30:26.552 --> 30:28.102
All right, good.
You did it, baby girl.

30:28.104 --> 30:29.437
I lost a couple
karma points,

30:29.439 --> 30:30.738
but, uh-huh, I did it.

30:30.740 --> 30:32.660
All right, I'm gonna
be there in about 5 minutes.

30:34.576 --> 30:36.560
I know you
and the first victims

30:36.562 --> 30:39.614
witnessed deputy Owen
kill the former sheriff.

30:39.616 --> 30:41.332
Why did he spare you?

30:41.334 --> 30:43.401
When he looks at me,
he sees dollar signs.

30:43.403 --> 30:46.838
He runs everything through
the pool hall and I don't say a word,

30:46.840 --> 30:49.791
'cause if I did,
he'd hurt my son.

30:49.793 --> 30:52.260
And he's got a lot of help.

30:52.262 --> 30:54.078
I mean, even if people
aren't getting paid off,

30:54.080 --> 30:56.798
they're all too scared
to say anything.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.266
So the whole force knows?

30:58.268 --> 30:59.583
Enough of them.

30:59.585 --> 31:01.185
What's he dealing?

31:01.187 --> 31:02.253
Everything.

31:02.255 --> 31:04.105
He gets all
the product he can

31:04.107 --> 31:06.307
and then he sells it
to the highest bidder.

31:06.309 --> 31:07.975
Where does he get it?

31:07.977 --> 31:09.260
Steals it.

31:09.262 --> 31:13.614
He even smuggles people
across the border.

31:13.616 --> 31:17.285
What are they gonna do?
He wears a badge, they don't.

31:17.287 --> 31:19.787
Where would deputy McGregor
go now that he knows we're closing in?

31:19.789 --> 31:23.607
To a junkyard he controls
on the edge of town.

31:23.609 --> 31:26.828
His final move's going
to be a distraction.

31:26.830 --> 31:28.413
Like what?

31:30.282 --> 31:31.582
You ok?

31:31.584 --> 31:33.217
Yeah. I'm just
really tired.

31:33.219 --> 31:35.619
Of course you are.
You need to get some sleep.

31:35.621 --> 31:39.623
Oh, but how can you sleep?
'Cause you're in a hospital

31:39.625 --> 31:42.059
where people
are always poking you.

31:42.061 --> 31:44.645
He had his meds
an hour ago.

31:44.647 --> 31:47.815
Yeah, post-op antibiotics.

31:48.851 --> 31:50.601
Yeah, he had those, too.

31:50.603 --> 31:51.602
Which ones?

31:51.604 --> 31:53.604
Carbenicillin?
No, that's not right.

31:53.606 --> 31:55.907
I have a severe reaction
to beta lactams.

31:55.909 --> 31:57.525
I can't have that.

31:57.527 --> 32:00.161
That's not in your chart.

32:02.331 --> 32:03.531
What are you doing?

32:03.533 --> 32:05.917
What are you doing?

32:09.371 --> 32:10.922
Garcia! He has a gun!

32:22.148 --> 32:24.449
He's moving.

32:24.451 --> 32:26.151
Ok.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.286
I didn't know how loud.

32:28.288 --> 32:30.705
I can't hear,
'cause my heart

32:30.707 --> 32:31.823
feels like
it's gonna come out.

32:31.825 --> 32:32.991
Can that happen?

32:32.993 --> 32:35.493
Physically, can your heart
burst out of your chest?

32:35.495 --> 32:37.078
And what is this ringing?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.498
My ears don't pop
for like a week after I fly,

32:40.500 --> 32:43.543
and if this is like that,
that's gonna drive me bonkers.

32:44.054 --> 32:44.740
Am I yelling?

32:44.765 --> 32:46.338
Because it feels like
I might be yelling.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.473
You saved my life.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.477
Can you hear me?

32:52.479 --> 32:54.462
Yeah, I heard that.
That makes it better.

32:54.464 --> 32:55.797
Thank you for saying that.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.265
Thank you for doing it.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.067
Uh-huh.

32:59.069 --> 33:01.302
Ok. You're ok.

33:01.304 --> 33:02.637
Ok.

33:09.311 --> 33:11.863
Oh, Josh.

33:14.366 --> 33:17.869
Oh, my sweet boy.

33:17.871 --> 33:19.498
The closest federal
support is an hour away.

33:19.523 --> 33:20.256
I've called the Rangers.

33:20.257 --> 33:22.424
How long for them.
30 minutes.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.010
Hey, Morgan.
Is everyone ok?

33:26.012 --> 33:28.546
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
It was all a big distraction.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.665
It's gotta be part
of McGregor's end game.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.984
He's headed to a junkyard.
I'll send you the address.

35:00.255 --> 35:01.439
FBI!

35:44.900 --> 35:46.968
Ok. It's ok.

35:46.970 --> 35:47.969
It's gonna be ok.

35:52.909 --> 35:54.442
Drop it!

37:30.756 --> 37:32.290
Huh. Look at this.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.741
It's a booked flight.

37:33.743 --> 37:36.577
Maybe with the year
we've all had,

37:36.579 --> 37:39.597
uh, the brass will give
us a bigger plane, you know.

37:39.599 --> 37:42.083
Yeah. Let me know
how that goes.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.218
What did
the Rangers think?

37:44.220 --> 37:46.220
Sadly, they've
seen this before.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.139
They're going to have
their hands full cleaning the place up.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.747
Hotch, don't tell me
we have another case.

37:55.749 --> 37:57.431
Are we turning
the plane around?

37:57.433 --> 37:59.250
No.

37:59.252 --> 38:01.652
No, we're gonna go home
and get some sleep.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.104
Lots of it, I hope.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.989
I am starting now.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.289
You sure you're ok?

38:22.291 --> 38:23.791
I feel great.

38:23.793 --> 38:25.960
Ah, that's overselling it.

38:25.962 --> 38:28.096
I, uh, I feel great

38:28.098 --> 38:32.150
considering I just
got shot in the neck.

38:46.415 --> 38:48.082
Where do you want this?

38:48.084 --> 38:50.034
Any--right there is fine.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.846
Ok. So, you should
get some sleep.

39:03.849 --> 39:05.332
You all right?

39:05.334 --> 39:09.270
Yesterday touched a nerve

39:09.272 --> 39:11.389
when I saw you like that.

39:13.341 --> 39:15.026
Who's Ethan?

39:18.280 --> 39:19.897
My son.

39:22.184 --> 39:25.653
He was 9 when he died.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.406
Doctors said
it was neurological,

39:28.408 --> 39:30.541
but they didn't have
a name for it.

39:30.543 --> 39:33.795
Still don't.
That drove me crazy.

39:33.797 --> 39:35.463
No word to put
to this thing

39:35.465 --> 39:39.050
that took away
my greatest love.

39:40.385 --> 39:41.586
I'm sorry.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.088
He kept growing
despite his disease.

39:44.090 --> 39:48.726
The last time I lay beside him
he was almost as long as me.

39:50.312 --> 39:51.813
He was ready to go.

39:51.815 --> 39:55.066
But I wasn't ready
to say good-bye.

39:58.854 --> 40:01.439
I begged him
to open his eyes.

40:01.441 --> 40:05.059
And the cruelest part
was that I could see

40:05.061 --> 40:09.947
who he would be at 20,
but I knew he'd never get there.

40:12.751 --> 40:14.585
Ethan is a great name.

40:14.587 --> 40:16.838
Yeah.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.956
It means enduring.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.092
It's fitting.

40:21.094 --> 40:23.544
You and James never
let go of one another.

40:31.854 --> 40:34.689
Have you ever
had that feeling

40:34.691 --> 40:37.525
that your future
is somehow behind you?

40:37.527 --> 40:39.644
All the time.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.195
I did, too.

40:41.197 --> 40:43.648
But it isn't.

40:44.533 --> 40:47.568
Ethan would have been
a lot like you.

40:49.071 --> 40:51.205
Thank you for being there
when I woke up.

40:51.207 --> 40:53.074
That meant a lot.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.276
Of course.

41:02.384 --> 41:04.502
