00:13.388 --> 00:14.222
Hi, Danny!

00:18.017 --> 00:19.936
Hey. Happy Friday, Danny.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.564
Yeah.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.072
Hey, my man. Could I get a lesson?
I gotta work on the strokes.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.866
- I don't want any trouble.
- No?

00:34.659 --> 00:35.910
Fuck the lesson.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.203
Papo Mejia says hello.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455
Wait, no.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.325
-  Chucho, bags in the trunk.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.998
Hello, my girl.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.708
Got you some treats.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.377
-  Hey!

01:28.671 --> 01:30.507
- Ooh!
- Hey.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.552
Listen.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.973
You're being too kind. You spoil them.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.226
All that stuff's cheaper up here.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.644
Yeah, right.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.856
Mmm. Look.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.610
Finally, the new scale. Ah.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.363
Like she got a mink coat.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.825
Weights are off, profits go down.
Less money for Griselda.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.787
Keep thinking like that.
You'll get that mink.

02:00.870 --> 02:04.582
Darling, I've got news.
And there's something you should see.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.752
- Hold on. Look what I got Ozzy.
-  Huh?

02:07.836 --> 02:08.878
Where is he?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.130
- Living room.
- Okay.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.427
You get my Cheetos?

02:17.053 --> 02:18.638
Do not wipe your hands on the couch.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.473
Look what I got you.

02:27.730 --> 02:32.026
Mom, what are you doing?
It's a Jaguar fish. It has to be alone.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.654
But look how pretty it is.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.573
It'll eat the other fish.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.832
He okay?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.044
Not since that fucking motel.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.257
What'd you want to show me?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.475
What the fuck happened to you?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.103
This asshole jumped me at my club.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.188
You have to kill him, Ms. Blanco.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.857
Calm down, McEnroe.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.901
It was Papo's guy.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.527
Took his product.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.488
What's his problem?

03:18.406 --> 03:19.824
That guy can hold a grudge.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.910
It's not just him pulling this shit.

03:21.993 --> 03:25.997
A lot of guys around town are taking shots
at each other, including Amilcar.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.958
He broke my hand.
How am I gonna give lessons?

03:30.001 --> 03:33.129
Tell your boss that...
I don't know, you were in a bar fight.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.964
I'll send Dario to check on you.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.051
They know that he's around,
they won't fuck with you.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.720
Let's go to the country club.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.723
Let's go, pretty boy.
I'll talk to your boss.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.394
-  So, you said you had news?

03:49.854 --> 03:50.980
Okay.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.818
I got a call from the Ochoas.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.573
Rafa Salazar wants to meet
with you and Panesso to talk about it.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.200
What for?

04:02.283 --> 04:03.952
My guess is...

04:05.912 --> 04:07.705
they'll want to buy you out.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.084
So what?

04:11.668 --> 04:14.128
I just walk away?

04:15.505 --> 04:17.840
People respect me, the job I do.

04:17.924 --> 04:21.761
Think about all the shit
you have to deal with every day.

04:21.844 --> 04:26.182
This week, it's a tennis pro with
a busted face. Next week, maybe worse.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.562
A buyout could be a good end to this.

04:39.737 --> 04:44.951
So, the shooter walked up,
opened the door, shot the driver. That it?

04:45.034 --> 04:49.080
So, the man came,
opened the door, and shot the driver?

04:49.163 --> 04:52.917
No, the driver saw him coming and went
to get out before the shooter got there.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.629
He says the door was already
open because the driver went to get out.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.341
Huh? No, no, no.
That's confusing as fuck, Hawkins. Uh...

05:02.093 --> 05:03.261
Ask him to demonstrate.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.515
The detective
would like you to demonstrate.

05:09.225 --> 05:13.313
Um, the shooter approached
as the driver opened the door.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.272
Mm-hmm.

05:14.355 --> 05:18.985
Then El Loco... I mean, the shooter

05:20.111 --> 05:25.033
put his hand on the roof
and shot him in the face.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.578
Give us a second.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.496
A word, Detective?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.128
What's up?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.881
I think he knows the shooter.

05:41.132 --> 05:44.302
He slipped and said, "El Loco,"
which is a nickname for Amilcar.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.430
Shit. Really?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.098
Mm-hmm.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.017
Okay, um...

05:51.934 --> 05:54.979
Ask him if he wants to come back
to the house, check photos.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.941
He's a doper, Bill. That might scare him.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.278
- Maybe kick him loose. Take it slow.
- Just fucking ask him.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.993
Let's assume for a second

06:09.077 --> 06:13.456
I stopped working
in the "party supply" business.

06:13.539 --> 06:19.796
I wouldn't be so busy,
always on the phone, running around.

06:20.463 --> 06:25.510
You could make us lunch, take us
to soccer practice like other moms.

06:26.594 --> 06:31.516
We could have more time together,
maybe go on a trip.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.976
A trip? Where?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.394
Brazil.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.188
Australia.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.148
Hawaii'd be cool.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.525
- Ooh!
- Hawaii.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.407
<i>♪ Everyone keeps asking... ♪</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:51.244
This thing with
the Ochoas bothering you?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.664
Can tell when you're distracted.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.917
I think I was pretty focused.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.462
I'm not talking about the sex.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.713
I'm talking about

07:03.965 --> 07:07.385
that thing you do
with your hand when you're tense,

07:07.468 --> 07:10.596
when you're nervous,
and you play with your ring.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.933
What'd I say about talking?

07:21.274 --> 07:26.487
Your loss. Women say I'm
a good listener, amongst other things.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.074
Women you pay.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.412
Make sure the boys don't see you.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.457
Listen to her.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.336
Good thing for you I'm so fucking good
at sneaking in and out of places.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.568
Need to
stop buying so many snacks.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.653
Our bras are no longer gonna fit.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.863
Mm-hmm.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.660
I heard about that thing with the Ochoas.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.665
Always wanted to fuck Fabio. That hair.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.375
Oh, no.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.838
I'll see if I can get them
to throw that in the deal.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.095
You know, the Ochoas
aren't the only ones who are famous.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.224
People in Medellín are asking about you.

08:37.683 --> 08:42.396
They say there's a lady narco up North,

08:43.356 --> 08:44.815
and no one believes it.

08:45.566 --> 08:48.486
But I tell them it's absolutely true.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.031
You know what they call her?

08:52.114 --> 08:53.115
Hmm?

08:55.243 --> 08:56.202
"The Godmother."

08:59.247 --> 09:01.749
Tell them to stop making up stories.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.699
"Godmother."

09:50.923 --> 09:51.924
So...

09:53.301 --> 09:55.344
welcome to the Bahamas.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.471
Flight wasn't too bad?

09:57.555 --> 09:58.973
I was waiting for you.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.978
Heard a lot about you.
Pleasure to meet you.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.271
Nice to meet you.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.230
German.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.566
- Finally.
- Good to meet you.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.483
How are you?

10:09.567 --> 10:12.903
I want to show you something.
This way, please.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.615
I dream of three things.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.243
Wet, hairy pussy,

10:19.994 --> 10:21.912
one day riding an elephant,

10:22.538 --> 10:23.706
and this.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.583
Huh!

10:26.709 --> 10:27.585
Incredible.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.130
You can get high like this.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.305
The Ochoas are the biggest suppliers
in Colombia, right?

10:39.889 --> 10:43.643
But when business slows down,
it's time to expand.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.394
So what do you do?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.188
Get some partners

10:47.271 --> 10:51.192
and buy your own fucking island
right outside the United States.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.028
Not for the pretty beaches or palm trees,

10:54.111 --> 10:58.115
but for the enormous
private airstrip you're standing on.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.868
We'll send a bale at a time.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.456
How? You're going
to move all of that at once?

11:05.539 --> 11:10.670
Drop 'em in the bay
with transponders to fish 'em out.

11:10.753 --> 11:14.423
We'll fly in twice a day.
We can send a hundred kilos per week.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.551
Bras are good, but this?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.221
Dear Lord...

11:27.478 --> 11:31.023
So, how about we have a drink and talk?

11:32.566 --> 11:34.693
I'll wait for you at the house.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.029
See you there.

11:40.825 --> 11:46.163
Jesus, that's enough powder
for every nose in America.

11:46.789 --> 11:50.042
They brought us here to intimidate us.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.129
I'm a supplier.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.548
A small fish compared to this.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.886
Not sure what he's gonna offer,
but whatever it is, take it.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.680
Are you seeing this?

12:03.472 --> 12:05.516
How's it going with the witness?

12:05.599 --> 12:07.435
He's thinking about coming in next week.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.063
Nice work, Moneypenny,

12:11.147 --> 12:13.399
but no protection
until he agrees to testify.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.776
And we stay on Amilcar.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.737
Well, Bill, I noticed that
we didn't get any prints from the scene,

12:18.821 --> 12:22.533
which is not good since we have some
on file for Amilcar we can match to.

12:22.616 --> 12:26.370
Yeah, it happens.
Assholes wear gloves.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.622
Or... Remember when the witness demonstrated

12:28.706 --> 12:31.417
how the shooter stood over the car?
He was left-handed.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.044
He put his right hand
on top of the car door.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.046
But the techs assumed
the guy was a righty,

12:36.130 --> 12:39.633
so they only dusted for the handle,
that's why they came away with no print.

12:39.717 --> 12:44.972
Okay. So, what, you want me
to pull the car out of impound,

12:45.055 --> 12:47.850
have it reprinted
because you've got a theory?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.936
You have theories all the time, Bill.

12:52.771 --> 12:53.689
Insights.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.650
I got insights, honey. And an insight is--

12:56.734 --> 12:59.028
I know what an insight is, Bill.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.072
Yeah.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.534
Yeah, you're real sharp.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.288
Uh, which makes me wonder
why you keep forgetting your job

13:09.371 --> 13:14.210
is to translate,
make sure that the coffee is hot,

13:14.293 --> 13:16.337
and to get the witness to talk.

13:18.672 --> 13:19.632
<i>Comprende?</i>

13:25.221 --> 13:26.347
Jeez Louise.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.610
Why the fuck
do you keep looking at me like that?

13:40.152 --> 13:40.986
Like what?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.364
Like you know something I don't.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.865
That's just how my face is.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.408
And...

13:48.369 --> 13:49.745
you don't want me to talk.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.748
If it's something useful, then say it.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.918
For example, who's that?

13:57.419 --> 13:58.420
Marta Ochoa.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.589
- Fabio's cousin.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.758
And Rafa's girlfriend.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.553
You can stop looking now.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.560
This--
This is Max Mermelstein.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.188
Max is gonna oversee
the smuggling side of the operation.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.523
He's smart.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.985
And the Ochoas
will like a gringo in the ground.

14:21.068 --> 14:24.613
-  Isn't that right, Max?
-  I'm a fat Jew engineer.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.407
Makes me an unlikely suspect.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.205
But this is not
just a smuggling operation.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.337
Moving that kind of volume will allow us
to control the prices of the coke.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.215
Which means we'll control the market.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.426
And we wanna do it top to bottom.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.305
So you'll have your own distribution too?

14:49.388 --> 14:50.431
That's right.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.099
Easier that way.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.227
The Ochoas are a family business.
Don't want any trouble.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.939
Otherwise, you got this fucking jumble
of dealers pissed off over rates,

14:59.023 --> 15:02.276
- turf, history, endless scores to settle.
-  The trunk.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.528
-  Better to start fresh.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.155
Not have to deal with all that shit.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.367
The Ochoas really appreciate
what you've set up in Miami.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.497
But they feel it's time for you
to step back and let us build on it.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.050
Fifteen million dollars,

15:27.092 --> 15:28.469
and you walk away clean.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.638
Both of you.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.518
Let me ask you a question.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.899
So, this offer is because
you don't want to deal with us?

15:43.609 --> 15:46.236
Or is because you don't think
that we can do this?

15:48.238 --> 15:49.073
Well...

15:50.866 --> 15:55.162
Sometimes, tearing down the house
is easier than patching up what is rotten.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.334
But I don't see what is not
to like here for you, Ms. Blanco.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.089
You walk into the sunset
to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.925
Don't have to worry about the cops.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.595
Some asshole dudes
shooting you in the back.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.641
I mean, how long can you keep this up?

16:27.277 --> 16:28.946
I can't accept your offer.

16:34.576 --> 16:39.289
You understand the Ochoas will own Miami,
whether you do this or not.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.918
And there will be no consideration.
Isn't that right?

16:46.338 --> 16:47.381
I understand.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.552
Okay. Fine.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.599
Good luck then... to both of you.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.855
<i>How could you do that to me?</i>

17:03.647 --> 17:07.609
Calm down, German. The Ochoas
know how valuable what we have is.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.902
That's why they want it.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.906
That buyout was nothing compared
to what we'll make going forward.

17:12.990 --> 17:17.745
There is no fucking going forward.
Don't you get that?

17:18.370 --> 17:22.958
They're taking Miami with their ocean
of coke, and there's no stopping them.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.918
I have a plan.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.879
Another of your fucking ideas!

17:28.172 --> 17:30.507
We've worked too hard for this.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.676
What?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.636
We just give it up?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.556
We owe it to our people.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.391
What about me?

17:40.392 --> 17:41.810
Did you even think of that?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.646
You backed me when no one else would.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.817
I don't forget that.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.905
You'll be my partner.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.618
Twenty-five percent of what I make.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.705
How does that sound?

18:07.127 --> 18:10.339
I reached out to all the dealers
and they've agreed to meet with you.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.341
Good.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.010
But they're skeptical, to put it mildly.

18:17.346 --> 18:21.266
Darling, you know
I've always backed you, but this--

18:28.524 --> 18:30.359
-  Hey.
-  Hey.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.362
-  Come in. How you doing?
- Good. There you are.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.448
-  Hey, sweetie.
- This month's tickets for you girls.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.451
Still no first class.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.665
Hey. You okay?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.377
Yeah. I just have
a lot on my mind right now.

18:50.879 --> 18:51.839
Hmm.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.384
I added a little extra.
I know you got a new car.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.137
About time I got rid
of that piece of shit, right?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.972
I do love driving my new beauty.

19:00.055 --> 19:00.889
Mm-hmm.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.976
It ended up working for both of us, huh?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.563
Let me know when you need
your next batch, okay?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.359
- Bye, sweetie.
-  See you.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.362
Look at you.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.490
"Godmother" for real.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.328
What are you gonna tell her
when there is no next batch?

19:23.412 --> 19:27.624
Or the girls,
when they can't smuggle anymore?

19:27.708 --> 19:30.294
Hopefully, I won't have to.

19:30.377 --> 19:35.465
If this works, there'll be plenty
of money and work to go around.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
Don't pay attention to him.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.845
You took us this far.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.599
- And got Panesso on board.
- Listen, kid.

19:45.642 --> 19:52.441
It's one thing to convince one man
and very different to convince 20.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.783
Rafa Salazar
is saying that he wants us out

20:01.867 --> 20:05.412
so that the Ochoas
can create a simpler system.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.291
That's bullshit.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.755
What they're really saying to us
is that we're not good enough.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.423
That we're stupid.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.844
Then how do we do this?

20:22.012 --> 20:25.098
We fucking come together. We unite.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.644
None of you take the fucking buyout.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.814
And then we're gonna tell them

20:32.898 --> 20:35.984
that they're not fucking moving
one gram of cocaine in Miami

20:36.068 --> 20:37.945
unless it's through us.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.113
That's how we're gonna take control.

20:40.197 --> 20:44.284
We're gonna tell Rafa that we already have
his fucking system in place.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.579
We know how it works,
and they're gonna get what they want,

20:47.663 --> 20:49.915
and we're gonna fucking keep what is ours.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.416
I don't know about any of you,

20:51.500 --> 20:55.462
but I'm not gonna fucking give it away
to those motherfuckers for nothing.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.508
And all we have to do
is fucking stick together.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.010
And we're gonna make
the big money for ourselves,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.888
for our families
and keep what is fucking ours!

21:04.972 --> 21:05.973
- Yeah.
- Fuck yeah!

21:06.056 --> 21:07.557
- Yeah!
- Go to town!

21:08.392 --> 21:10.310
-  Yeah!
- Let's do it.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.771
Okay.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.691
Okay.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.777
I have to admit, it sounds good.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.447
Even if it's coming out
of this fucking bitch's mouth.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.908
-  But here's the question.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.121
Who's gonna run this thing?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.666
We're gonna share the profit
between all of us based on territory--

21:32.749 --> 21:34.418
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.171
Who is the one in charge?

21:39.172 --> 21:41.967
We're working as a group of equals,

21:42.050 --> 21:45.262
but someone has to go talk
to the Ochoas, and it's gonna be me.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.807
"A group of equals."
Sounds like some bullshit.

21:48.890 --> 21:53.061
This is just another fucking way
for her to run us like we work for her.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.566
No. It's about what's good for all of us.

21:58.191 --> 22:02.070
- Who the fuck cares who's in charge?
- I fucking care who's gonna be in charge.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.574
I'm not taking orders
from a woman that I don't fucking trust.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.992
Man's got a point.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.870
How do we know
what you're saying to the Ochoas?

22:10.871 --> 22:12.372
Where's Amilcar, Rivi?

22:13.373 --> 22:14.708
What'd he say?

22:16.168 --> 22:19.046
Amilcar's got too much heat
on him right now.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.301
Papo and I are here
to see what she had to say.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.180
You think he's gonna do it?

22:33.769 --> 22:35.896
He's determined to take the buyout.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.276
There's no fucking way
I'm doing this without Amilcar.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.697
Hey, come on. Just think
about what you're passing up.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.574
The fucking money, and--

22:50.327 --> 22:51.578
It was a good try.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.547
We turned down
15 million for this shit?

23:10.138 --> 23:11.139
Rivi.

23:13.391 --> 23:17.687
Just give me a chance
to talk to Amilcar. I can convince him.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.526
You want to talk to him?

23:27.114 --> 23:28.281
Get in.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.731
Open the glove box.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.885
Put them back like they were,
with the label facing out.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.848
How long
you worked for Amilcar?

24:36.266 --> 24:37.934
Said I'd drive you to see him,

24:39.644 --> 24:42.189
not have a conversation.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.443
Why?

24:47.944 --> 24:48.945
Not good at talking?

24:51.573 --> 24:52.657
Depends what about.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.536
How to approach your boss?

24:59.497 --> 25:00.582
Know what I think?

25:04.169 --> 25:06.087
You respect what I said back there.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.092
Or else I wouldn't be in your pretty car.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.683
Have you been under surveillance
from the Miami PD and the DEA?

25:21.102 --> 25:22.938
Amilcar's being linked to a murder.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.483
He's getting cornered in all directions.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.655
The Ochoas are the only light he can see.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.043
Thank you for seeing me.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.670
I know we've had our differences,

25:46.753 --> 25:49.172
but I hope that Rivi
had a chance to explain.

25:50.173 --> 25:53.009
Rivi says so, I listen to him.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.887
Yeah, he seems very smart.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.683
Couldn't get through this without him.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.477
Amilcar.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.605
I'm here to tell you my plan.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.901
- Let's discuss how you and I--
- I already know your plan.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.321
- Sal called me.
- Ah.

26:14.656 --> 26:18.159
Get the villagers together
to stop the big bad ogre.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.122
Look, I admire anyone who can stand

26:22.205 --> 26:25.166
in front of these assholes
and convince them to do anything.

26:26.501 --> 26:30.046
But I've always wanted to go see opera
in Lake Como, you know?

26:30.130 --> 26:34.801
They got this murder they wanna get me
for with this witness who may talk.

26:35.802 --> 26:36.720
So...

26:37.429 --> 26:41.725
I think this is gonna
have to be a friendly drink.

26:42.892 --> 26:43.977
Unless, you know,

26:46.313 --> 26:48.023
you wanna spend the night.

26:49.607 --> 26:50.608
But to be honest...

26:52.319 --> 26:54.821
...even that
wouldn't change my mind.

26:58.783 --> 26:59.743
Listen.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.037
Okay, now, Rivi's gonna drive you home.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.690
We going or not?

27:34.778 --> 27:35.820
Hey.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.658
Did you forget something?

27:42.494 --> 27:45.955
Did you say
there was a witness to that murder?

27:49.501 --> 27:50.377
Yes.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.546
I'll kill him for you.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.676
It'd be suspicious if you do it.

27:59.844 --> 28:04.057
This way, the heat on you dies,
and you can join our fucking union.

28:10.438 --> 28:12.315
Let someone else
do your dirty work.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.564
That's the address
where the witness lives.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.607
Take Chucho.

28:59.779 --> 29:04.117
I know what it's like
to have blood on my hands.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.120
Really?

29:08.913 --> 29:12.917
First time I killed for money, I was 14.

29:13.501 --> 29:16.254
For a long time, the only thing I knew

29:16.337 --> 29:19.424
is what it's like
to have blood on my hands.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.178
So what changed?

29:25.680 --> 29:26.890
I came to Miami.

29:28.892 --> 29:35.064
Point is, killing your asshole husband's
not the same as this.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.819
So what should I do?

29:41.905 --> 29:46.659
Let them come in here and take everything?

29:49.370 --> 29:51.498
I just want you to know...

29:53.333 --> 29:55.043
what this will cost you.

29:57.003 --> 29:57.921
Hmm?

30:12.435 --> 30:13.561
Okay.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.841
I've done all the hard work here.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.133
<i>What's on your mind?</i>

30:44.217 --> 30:47.136
Sir, I appreciate
you asked me to join Homicide,

30:47.220 --> 30:48.930
but it's not really working out.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.934
I know the guys
can say some off-color things.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.979
No, sir. If I let that bother me,
I'd never leave the house.

30:58.064 --> 30:58.982
So?

31:01.109 --> 31:04.112
The hours and the frustrations
that you guys deal with here,

31:04.195 --> 31:05.446
it's not worth it for me.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.366
Honestly, the only reason
I even became a cop

31:08.449 --> 31:10.702
was because I needed
the benefits for my son.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.287
Well, you could have fooled me.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.455
The way you work, it seems like you care.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.749
And you're good.

31:18.626 --> 31:21.880
Well, put me on a desk
where I can smile and answer the phone.

31:23.464 --> 31:26.551
And I could, uh, pick up
my kid from baseball practice.

31:28.428 --> 31:29.387
Okay.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.056
If that's what you want.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.476
Thank you.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.669
Chucho.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.840
Don't think too much.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.177
We get in and out, quick.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.138
You ready?

32:14.390 --> 32:15.224
Ready.

32:32.241 --> 32:36.955
<i>Good evening,
welcome to the Action News at 10...</i>

32:48.841 --> 32:51.844
Shh. Shut the fuck up.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.305
Get the fuck down.

32:54.847 --> 32:55.848
Honey?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.393
No, no, no!

32:58.476 --> 33:00.228
-  No!

33:06.150 --> 33:07.068
It's okay.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.293
- No, but--
- Pay me.

33:40.852 --> 33:41.811
Hello?

33:42.770 --> 33:44.522
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

33:44.605 --> 33:46.524
<i>Witness has a wife and a baby here.</i>

33:48.276 --> 33:49.193
A wife and baby...

33:52.530 --> 33:54.198
Kid's maybe six months.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.910
<i>If we let them go, they'll go into hiding.</i>

34:01.456 --> 34:02.623
What do you want to do?

34:18.556 --> 34:19.557
Do it.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.656
Mom?

34:37.700 --> 34:38.868
I'm having nightmares.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.246
Will you read to me?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.664
Come here, baby.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.297
You're safe with me.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.383
No one can hurt you.

35:03.601 --> 35:04.685
<i>It's done.</i>

35:30.711 --> 35:32.547
It's out of control.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.591
What is it, Bill?

35:36.926 --> 35:38.928
You don't wanna see that shit, June.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.018
Worst I've seen in a long time.

35:56.779 --> 35:57.905
That's our witness.

35:57.989 --> 35:58.990
June.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.452
This is not your fault.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.121
I know, sir.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.749
So, uh, why am I here?

36:11.043 --> 36:13.337
We need your expertise in here.

36:21.721 --> 36:22.805
Jesus.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.060
Child services will be here
in about an hour or so.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.776
The case against me is over now.

36:36.569 --> 36:37.570
Thank you.

36:38.654 --> 36:42.158
Now, you saw how those dealers and Rafa,

36:42.241 --> 36:45.578
they only accepted anything
if it came out of a man's mouth, right?

36:49.624 --> 36:50.666
Let me be clear.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.881
This is not me trying to take away
something that's rightfully yours.

36:57.548 --> 36:58.507
You've earned it.

36:59.967 --> 37:03.638
This is just me saying that,
honestly, if your plan is gonna work,

37:05.097 --> 37:06.265
I'm in charge.

37:10.478 --> 37:13.356
But you're gonna consult me
on every fucking decision.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.276
Behind the scenes,
we work together.

37:19.278 --> 37:22.240
In public... it's me.

37:30.039 --> 37:34.543
Intelligence analyst,
translator, and a nanny.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.504
Can you believe that?

37:37.129 --> 37:38.047
Yeah.

37:41.259 --> 37:45.596
Uh, Officer Hawkins?
Julie Barnes, Social Services.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.056
Oh.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.392
He's, uh... He's pretty calm now.

37:49.475 --> 37:52.061
Yeah. Hi.

37:53.229 --> 37:54.522
Oh, oh, oh.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.317
We'll find him a good home.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.531
It's better that he never know this one.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.324
Yeah.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.535
Come on.

38:29.265 --> 38:32.184
<i>You get an integrated system
with people who know the city.</i>

38:32.935 --> 38:35.479
It'll be efficient with no infighting.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.858
And I will manage it all for you.

38:39.984 --> 38:43.070
Any problems with any other dealers
will be my responsibility.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.948
So all you have to worry about
is getting me product.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.743
Think you can pull that off?

38:49.618 --> 38:50.911
Bring them together?

38:53.622 --> 38:54.790
Already have.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.086
We just need your stamp of approval.

39:01.714 --> 39:06.010
It's not exactly what we had in mind,
but I think it's a good solution.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.179
The Ochoas will approve.

39:11.223 --> 39:14.602
Congratulations.
You now run every dealer in Miami.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.395
Well, let's celebrate.

39:16.479 --> 39:17.813
Waiter, champagne.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.691
I want you both to come
to the Mutiny tomorrow night.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.151
Meet the others. Hmm?

39:25.154 --> 39:26.572
Congratulations, partner.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.078
Sorry. I'm going to the restroom.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.711
That's wonderful. Yes.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.755
Congratulations, Griselda.

39:43.756 --> 39:47.093
But you deserved
more than a simple... "partnership."

39:49.220 --> 39:50.930
- It'll do for now.
- Mmm.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.807
When it no longer does,

39:54.642 --> 39:56.143
you may need my help.

39:58.145 --> 40:01.232
When a man like you offers me help,
I assume he means something else.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.149
Hmm.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.652
- A man like me?
-  Hmm.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.781
You think I'm one of them?

40:10.449 --> 40:11.826
They're full of rage.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.496
Can't see past their two front feet.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.418
And this one,

40:21.377 --> 40:22.545
you have here?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.132
Your attack dog.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.888
You fuck him yet?

40:48.904 --> 40:50.322
Hawkins!

40:52.116 --> 40:56.162
What the fuck? Had the fucking lab reprint
that car after I told you not to?

40:56.745 --> 40:59.748
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I know.
I know I shouldn't have, but I--

40:59.832 --> 41:03.419
But that asshole killed our witness.

41:08.757 --> 41:10.593
You were right as fucking rain.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.136
Prints are a match with Amilcar.

41:14.722 --> 41:15.806
You're joking.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.851
No, ma'am.
Enough to put in for a warrant for him.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.854
Nice fucking work, Hawkins.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.316
Just make sure to, uh, put it in a memo.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.736
- Last day. No more memos.

41:31.113 --> 41:32.114
Nice work, kid.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.036
Last day.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.538
And I finally solve one.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.001
Listen up, ladies.

41:44.084 --> 41:47.171
Griselda's about to be
the new boss of Miami.

41:47.254 --> 41:50.674
So we're celebrating tonight.
Get ready to party.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.134
- Whoo!
-  Hey!

41:52.218 --> 41:55.804
Buy whatever dresses you want.
Need to look sharp.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.515
And what about our hair?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.350
Yes, for that too.

42:00.726 --> 42:03.604
Sweetie, what about nails?

42:05.272 --> 42:08.859
You know what?
Buy whatever you want. You deserve it.

42:12.488 --> 42:13.614
Thank you, Godmother.

42:14.698 --> 42:17.826
<i>A couple
was murdered in their home yesterday,</i>

42:17.910 --> 42:19.828
<i>leaving a baby behind.</i>

42:19.912 --> 42:20.996
Turn that off.

42:21.747 --> 42:22.581
We want to hear.

42:23.123 --> 42:24.792
<i>One of the couple</i>

42:24.875 --> 42:27.294
<i>may have been a witness
in a federal investigation.</i>

42:27.378 --> 42:29.755
-  I said, turn it off.
-  Mom!

42:33.300 --> 42:34.468
You're late.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.860
<i>A source who spoke
off the record indicated...</i>

43:02.204 --> 43:04.832
We have the party
at the Mutiny tonight

43:04.915 --> 43:06.292
to celebrate the new deal.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.461
We're gonna run this town now.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.716
Sure, we'll run it.

43:16.468 --> 43:17.553
You okay?

43:18.846 --> 43:19.847
Me?

43:21.390 --> 43:22.516
What do you mean?

43:25.060 --> 43:26.854
Thought you didn't care.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.983
It was a lot, what I asked.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.111
Nothing I haven't done before.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.285
What bothers me is you had to do it.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.330
Hmm?

43:45.122 --> 43:47.875
That this is what it takes
for them to see you.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.935
Hey, uh, are you Hawkins?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.105
Yeah. Why?

44:10.939 --> 44:12.107
I'm Diaz.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.192
How are you?

44:13.776 --> 44:15.486
I'm Special Assignments.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.529
I cover important homicide,
narcotics cases.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.283
Yeah, I know who you are.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.830
Well, you know, we've been after Amilcar
for, uh, quite a while now,

44:26.914 --> 44:28.791
but I saw you got the hit on the print.

44:28.874 --> 44:31.502
You made the warrant.
I just wanted to say thank you.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.130
You're welcome.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.717
What are you, uh...
You're moving or something?

44:40.594 --> 44:43.972
Um, I decided that Homicide,
it wasn't for me.

44:49.728 --> 44:50.729
Hey.

44:51.313 --> 44:54.358
You know, we're...
We're about to go roll on this asshole.

44:54.441 --> 44:57.319
There's nothing like
putting cuffs on one that you earned.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.071
You wanna come along?

44:59.154 --> 45:00.072
See how it feels?

45:07.454 --> 45:09.790
I think Bruno
might have gone a little short this time.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.668
Nah, it looks good.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.052
- Show me your hands!
- Don't move!

45:23.262 --> 45:24.388
Stop, asshole!

45:24.471 --> 45:25.806
Get him! Get him!

45:26.598 --> 45:29.101
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

45:30.436 --> 45:32.396
Get us out of here! Get us out of here!

45:35.732 --> 45:38.318
Rafael Amilcar Rodriguez,
step out of the vehicle.

45:58.213 --> 45:59.923
Police! Everybody down!

46:02.718 --> 46:04.136
-  Move!

46:39.546 --> 46:40.756
Where's Amilcar?

46:45.385 --> 46:49.306
<i>♪ When we hit those islands
There's gonna be a big hello ♪</i>

46:52.100 --> 46:53.185
Griselda.

46:53.268 --> 46:54.895
What's going on?

46:54.978 --> 46:56.855
Can I talk to her for a minute?

47:03.445 --> 47:04.988
Where's Amilcar?

47:05.072 --> 47:06.698
He was arrested about an hour ago.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.703
But I got rid of the witness.

47:11.787 --> 47:15.457
Fucking cops had something else on him.

47:17.292 --> 47:22.172
Well, I can still convince them
to let me be in charge.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.258
Papo got Amilcar's territories.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.636
And he doesn't want
to be in business with you.

47:27.719 --> 47:30.681
What's more,
he already made a deal with Rafa.

47:31.306 --> 47:34.142
Son of a bitch. Why didn't you call me,
German, try to stop him?

47:34.226 --> 47:35.435
Griselda.

47:36.687 --> 47:37.854
Because I'm going with him.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.107
What are you saying?

47:40.190 --> 47:41.984
I brought your dealers with me.

47:42.651 --> 47:46.071
But they're my dealers. Loyal to me.

47:46.154 --> 47:49.950
Come on, they're aerobics instructors,
hairstylists, tennis pros.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.662
You give them more money,
you threaten them,

47:53.745 --> 47:56.039
and those motherfuckers
happily switch sides.

47:57.499 --> 47:59.042
German, I trusted you.

47:59.126 --> 48:01.295
Why the fuck didn't you take the buyout?

48:02.713 --> 48:03.589
Bastard.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.300
Rafa, just give me a moment to explain.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.677
Why?
You got nothing to give him.

48:18.270 --> 48:21.148
I told you I was gonna fuck you back
one way or another.

48:26.361 --> 48:27.529
Rafa, listen.

48:29.448 --> 48:33.118
This whole idea
was mine from the beginning.

48:33.201 --> 48:34.870
I know what you're about to say.

48:35.912 --> 48:39.333
You think we don't do our homework
before we come into a city?

48:41.209 --> 48:44.713
I know who opened the markets
with all those rich people.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.382
I know it was you.

48:49.801 --> 48:55.015
Those other idiots could never do it.

48:55.724 --> 48:56.600
Good.

48:57.517 --> 49:00.187
So we can figure this out. Make it right--

49:00.270 --> 49:02.689
No. I don't think so.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.527
- But you just said--
- Uh.

49:08.612 --> 49:09.780
I know what I said.

49:11.531 --> 49:16.078
You think I'll give
all the power to some mouthy, smart bitch

49:16.161 --> 49:18.622
rather than these two idiots
that I can control?

49:19.831 --> 49:21.166
I don't think so.

49:23.710 --> 49:24.753
The truth is...

49:28.131 --> 49:29.883
you scare me more than they do.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.308
Like I was saying, Max...

49:48.235 --> 49:50.570
The door is that way, bitch.

49:54.116 --> 49:57.536
<i>♪ Gotta go home, home, home ♪</i>

49:57.619 --> 50:01.248
<i>♪ Gotta go home, home, home ♪</i>

50:01.331 --> 50:04.835
<i>♪ Gotta go home, home, home ♪</i>

50:04.918 --> 50:06.461
<i>♪ Gotta go home ♪</i>

50:16.805 --> 50:18.181
What happened?

50:20.225 --> 50:21.852
Are you okay? What happened?

50:26.732 --> 50:29.443
I killed those people for nothing, Dario.

50:35.323 --> 50:38.994
So those assholes
could just take it all from me.

51:00.474 --> 51:03.852
She showed more guts
than any cop I saw in a long time.

51:03.935 --> 51:06.062
And I've seen bad motherfuckers in my day.

51:06.146 --> 51:06.980
Yeah.

51:07.063 --> 51:08.440
- Well said.
- Hey. To June.

51:08.523 --> 51:10.942
Cheers!

51:11.026 --> 51:12.235
Well done, kid.

51:13.361 --> 51:15.739
Hey, give us two minutes.
Two minutes, boys.

51:16.990 --> 51:17.991
Excuse me.

51:25.791 --> 51:26.958
You all right?

51:28.126 --> 51:33.715
Uh... Honestly? I'm still shaking.
I'm not sure if I'm terrified or...

51:33.799 --> 51:35.675
Explain to me why you quit Homicide.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.178
Had my reasons.

51:40.138 --> 51:42.516
What's it matter, Diaz? You got your guy.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.936
I got one, June, okay?
This is just the start.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.899
Look, I'm putting together
what they call a CENTAC.

51:50.982 --> 51:54.236
It's a central tactical unit.
Feds, local agents.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.572
Actually, I was having
some trouble with the funding,

51:57.656 --> 51:59.157
but what you did today will help.

52:00.450 --> 52:01.952
What <i>I</i> did today?

52:03.078 --> 52:04.371
Mm-hmm.

52:04.454 --> 52:07.874
The higher-ups see what's happening
around here. They want something done.

52:07.958 --> 52:11.419
And it's fucking up
our community, our people.

52:11.503 --> 52:14.840
Not just crime. The way they see us.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.885
So you're gonna change
the way they see us.

52:20.637 --> 52:21.513
Well...

52:22.180 --> 52:23.598
Not bad on camera, right?

52:26.309 --> 52:27.269
Hey.

52:28.103 --> 52:29.771
One hell of a fucking day, huh?

52:30.397 --> 52:31.565
To going out in style.

52:34.067 --> 52:35.318
Going out in style.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.120
Enjoy that desk.

52:48.456 --> 52:50.000
"Enjoy that desk."

52:52.210 --> 52:53.211
Really?

52:57.716 --> 52:58.884
Okay, Diaz.

53:00.385 --> 53:01.928
I'll join your CENTAC.

53:02.721 --> 53:05.682
Long as you promise me
not to get me in any more shootouts.

53:14.941 --> 53:18.445
I can't promise it,
and I'm not sure you want me to.

53:59.861 --> 54:00.862
Mm.
