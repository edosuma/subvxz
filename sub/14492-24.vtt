you little scallion. Oh!

03:15.400 --> 03:18.560
You shouldn't have done.

It's a little cake.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.400
Oh.

03:25.480 --> 03:28.320
And my forth Oscar

There. Now we do this.
Now, there.

Toodle-oo.

Bye.

What's this?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.320
Oh, no chef?

08:06.400 --> 08:08.800
Oh, no, waiter, just you.

What am I supposed to cook?

08:21.720 --> 08:22.920
Oh.

Right.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.880
Monsieur, monsieur, I pace
myself, but it won't be long.
