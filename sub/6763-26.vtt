09:53.159 --> 09:54.927
Come on, this is simple.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.262
See, I check in, bail out.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.630
Hurry back in time

09:57.697 --> 09:59.031
{\an1}for the afternoon
session.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.866
You know, I really hope you know
what you're doing

10:00.933 --> 10:02.068
and Mrs. Teasley doesn't.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.036
You know, you were
a lot more fun

10:04.103 --> 10:05.338
when you were going out with me.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.006
Hmm.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.675
{\an1}Thank you.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.344
{\an3}Thank you.
(laughs)

10:17.683 --> 10:20.252
Man, quadratic equations,
do you understand these?

10:20.319 --> 10:22.822
I'm more a man of letters.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.890
I am so bummed.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.994
It turns out I didn't even have
to go to detention today.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.061
{\an3}We had a substitute
proctor.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.364
{\an3}The guy never even looked up
when he called the roll.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.365
You could have
sat in for me,

10:32.431 --> 10:34.000
he would've never have
known the difference.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.634
I highly doubt it.

10:35.701 --> 10:36.736
Are you almost ready?

10:36.802 --> 10:39.405
Uh, no, I gotta wait for Willie
and Nadine to show up.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.240
Maybe you should just head up
there without me.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.808
{\an3}That's all right,
I'll hang.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.176
{\an5}They'll be here in
a minute, right?
I hope so.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.312
Thank God that fan club
flaked out.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.848
{\an3}Well, that Ginger
chick was, uh, flaky.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.684
Foxy, but flaky.

10:51.751 --> 10:52.685
(phone rings)

10:52.752 --> 10:54.153
{\an1}Help yourself
to some coffee, bro.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.388
Thanks, man.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.424
{\an3}So aren't you
supposed

10:58.491 --> 11:00.159
{\an3}to be in study hall or
something, Steve?

11:00.226 --> 11:01.260
Nope.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.294
{\an1}I'm heading up
to Magic Mountain

11:02.361 --> 11:03.996
{\an1}just as soon as the big guy
finishes cleaning up.

11:04.063 --> 11:04.997
You'd better hope

11:05.064 --> 11:06.232
Miss T doesn't find out.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.069
You're like two peas in a pod.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.137
What?

11:11.203 --> 11:12.271
Never mind.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.806
Man, you guys aren't
gonna believe this.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.274
Willie and Nadine were riding
into work together

11:15.341 --> 11:16.842
and get in a fender bender.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.344
{\an1}They okay?
Yeah,

11:18.411 --> 11:19.879
{\an3}but they gotta wait
for a tow truck.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.113
It's a real mess.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.348
Looks like I'm stuck here.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.849
{\an1}Man.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.351
I'm sorry, bro.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.053
{\an1}I'm gonna make
a quick pit stop,

11:27.119 --> 11:28.287
then I'm headin'
for the Mountain.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.391
All right, Brandon,
I gotta tell ya,

11:32.458 --> 11:33.993
sometimes it's all I can do

11:34.060 --> 11:35.861
to keep from just telling
Sanders where to go.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.296
Hey, come on, cut the guy
some slack, will ya?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.365
Any more slack
and he'd be a liquid, man.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.300
This guy's always working some
angle on somebody, you know?

11:41.367 --> 11:44.737
He's trying to pass himself off
as "Mr. Hollywood--

11:44.804 --> 11:46.238
Hey, I got
this town wired, babe."

11:46.305 --> 11:48.340
To tell you the truth, I think
he's a little jealous of you.

11:48.407 --> 11:49.942
After all, you are going out
with his ex.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.311
You gotta be kidding me.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.280
Hey, everybody's
got a girl but him.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.449
You don't.
I choose not to.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.817
There's a big difference there.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.485
Yeah, right.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.287
Adios, amigos.

12:04.190 --> 12:07.860
Look, everybody,
we're here now.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.296
{\an1}Uh, this is the Peach Pit,
an old-time Hollywood hangout.

12:10.362 --> 12:11.297
So come on in,

12:11.363 --> 12:16.135
{\an1}find a seat, check out
the mementos on the wall.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.971
(sighs):
What a morning.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.373
These people complain
about everything.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.142
You were supposed to be here
45 minutes ago.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.944
The bus was late.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.179
And I thought it was supposed
to be 20 people.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.481
That's what Parnell told me.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.983
Is he here?

12:31.050 --> 12:32.485
Of course not.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.321
Order what you want, everybody,

12:35.387 --> 12:36.856
{\an3}it's all included
in the package.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.224
Ginger, I don't know how

12:38.290 --> 12:39.825
I'm supposed to serve
all these people.

12:39.892 --> 12:40.726
I'm home alone here.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.895
{\an4}Relax, man.
I'll, uh, I'll
man the grill.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.397
No offense, D, but I'd
better do the cooking.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.198
{\an3}I gotcha covered,
Brandon.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.502
{\an3}After all, I used
to work here.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.940
{\an3}Who wants what?
Coffee? Peach pie?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.978
(people screaming)

13:11.590 --> 13:13.259
All right!

13:14.927 --> 13:17.129
{\an5}ANDREA:
No wonder they call it
The Colossus.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.230
It's so big.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.532
{\an3}Well, you better
start movin'

13:19.598 --> 13:20.900
before the line
gets too long.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.301
{\an3}Come on!

13:22.368 --> 13:23.936
{\an1}I'll catch up
with you guys later.

13:24.003 --> 13:24.970
I have all this paperwork
to take care of

13:25.037 --> 13:25.971
with the administration office.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.573
Can't you just do it later?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.074
{\an1}I'd rather do it now,
you know,

13:29.141 --> 13:30.342
get it out of the way.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.012
Okay. Well, we'll meet you at
the office after the ride, okay?

13:33.078 --> 13:34.313
{\an3}Any day now guys,
come on.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.848
Do you need any help with that?

13:35.915 --> 13:36.849
No, no, go on.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.985
It's a one-woman job,
absolutely. (chuckles)

13:42.955 --> 13:44.590
I'm sorry.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.559
No harm, no foul.

13:49.628 --> 13:50.563
You know, Burt Reynolds
walked in here once.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.431
He found Clint Eastwood
sitting on his stool.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.632
And the next thing you know,

13:53.699 --> 13:55.901
they were shaking hands on
a deal to do a picture together.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.204
Is that right?

13:58.270 --> 13:59.271
Where is Ginger?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.040
{\an1}We don't want to miss
that screening.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.475
{\an3}Yep, and we don't want
you to miss it.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.578
Hey, man, here you go.

14:05.644 --> 14:06.478
I uh, got it all totaled up.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.581
here are your checks,
here's the receipts.

14:08.647 --> 14:09.248
Great. Thanks, man.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.916
{\an1}No sweat--
the sooner we get

14:10.983 --> 14:11.850
{\an1}all these people
out of here,

14:11.917 --> 14:14.053
{\an1}the quicker I can go
back to the study thing.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.187
Hey, have you seen Ginger?

14:15.254 --> 14:16.956
{\an1}I think she's in
the little girls' room.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.257
Cool, thanks.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.061
Hey, Ginger?

14:22.127 --> 14:23.929
Ginger, you in there?

14:26.131 --> 14:27.633
Ginger?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.135
(woman sobbing)

14:34.139 --> 14:36.108
(woman sobbing)

14:36.175 --> 14:38.143
Ginger?

14:43.382 --> 14:44.617
You in there?

14:44.683 --> 14:48.654
Can't a girl have
a little privacy?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.624
Uh... you're in the men's room.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.592
Oh, my God.

14:53.659 --> 14:58.163
Hey, what's the matter?

14:58.230 --> 14:59.331
Can I help?

15:01.267 --> 15:05.604
I don't know how.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.039
You wanna hear this?

15:07.106 --> 15:09.108
The theater

15:09.174 --> 15:11.010
where we're supposed to hold
all the screenings

15:11.076 --> 15:14.013
never heard of J. Thomas Parnell
Celebrity Tours.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.683
Well, did you try calling
Parnell's office?

15:17.750 --> 15:22.087
There was no answer,

15:22.154 --> 15:25.190
not even an answering machine.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.427
Of course, this would
happen to me.

15:28.494 --> 15:32.531
My first job in L.A.
and I end up in the toilet.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.166
The men's toilet, no less.

15:34.233 --> 15:39.071
Well, you gotta admit,
it is a pretty classy toilet.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.541
Is that what I think it is?

15:45.144 --> 15:46.712
Yeah.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.047
Don't worry.
It's not too bad.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.049
How bad?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.985
$312.76

15:55.187 --> 15:57.356
(sobbing)

15:57.423 --> 16:00.292
Mr. Parnell was supposed to be
here to take care of all that.

16:00.359 --> 16:04.596
You mean, you don't
have any money?

16:20.412 --> 16:22.214
BRANDON:
<i>Hey, if it's any consolation,</i>

16:22.281 --> 16:24.750
{\an1}in my humble opinion,
you look marvelous.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.086
You're so sweet.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.088
{\an3}I mean, here I'm the
one who brought in

16:29.154 --> 16:32.124
{\an3}all those movie buffs,
and can't pay the bill and...

16:34.760 --> 16:36.462
Oh, my God.

16:36.528 --> 16:39.131
{\an3}I still don't know
what I'm going to say

16:39.198 --> 16:40.733
{\an3}to all those people
out there.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.568
{\an1}Look, first of all,
don't worry about the bill.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.703
{\an1}I'm sure this Parnell guy
is on his way here right now.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.305
(knocking)

16:46.372 --> 16:49.508
{\an1}Yeah, just give me
a second, will ya, pal?

16:49.575 --> 16:51.377
{\an4}MAN:
Hey, will you hurry
up in there?

16:51.443 --> 16:55.314
In my experience, you can never
go wrong with telling the truth.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.316
They'll understand.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.784
First the motel wasn't booked,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.387
then the bus is an hour late,
there's now no screening?

17:01.453 --> 17:03.689
Next you're going to tell us
we have to pay twice

17:03.756 --> 17:05.523
for a pre-paid breakfast.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.292
{\an6}I don't know what
kind of a stunt you're
trying to pull here,

17:08.359 --> 17:10.662
{\an3}but I have half a mind
to call the cops right now.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.098
I'm sure Mr. Parnell
will be here any minute.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.800
Well, until he shows up,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.069
we are not budging
one inch from this spot.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.371
{\an3}We expect to get
everything we paid for.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.674
that includes meeting
Mr. Burt Reynolds himself.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.643
{\an3}She promised
Burt Reynolds?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.778
She didn't, Parnell did.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.213
People, people.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.449
{\an1}You came to Hollywood
to see some stars, right?

17:30.516 --> 17:31.717
{\an1}Now, I don't know about
Burt Reynolds--

17:31.784 --> 17:33.385
{\an1}he may come through
that door any minute,

17:33.452 --> 17:35.687
but he is not the only star
in Hollywood's galaxy.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.456
{\an1}Now...

17:37.523 --> 17:40.592
how would you like
to meet the star

17:40.659 --> 17:44.430
of the longest-running
show in TV history?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.833
We're gonna meet Tony Danza?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.301
No.

17:50.335 --> 17:53.172
How would you like to meet...

17:53.238 --> 17:54.273
Samantha Sanders?

17:55.274 --> 17:56.742
Who?

17:56.809 --> 17:59.478
Samantha Sanders.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.813
The star of <i> The Hartley House.</i>

18:00.879 --> 18:02.614
{\an6}WOMAN:
You listen to me,
young man.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.650
{\an3}We paid to meet
Mr. Burt Reynolds,

18:04.716 --> 18:06.652
{\an3}star of <i> Deliverance,</i>
<i>Starting Over,</i>

18:06.718 --> 18:07.820
and <i> Cop-And-A-Half.</i>

18:07.886 --> 18:11.123
{\an3}Not some washed up old actress
from some stupid sitcom

18:11.190 --> 18:12.124
{\an3}that's been off the air
for ten years.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.659
Lady, I'll poke you in the eye,

18:13.725 --> 18:14.760
just to take some
of the pressure

18:14.827 --> 18:16.261
off the bulge in your neck...

18:16.328 --> 18:17.296
{\an1}Hey, hey,
easy, easy...

18:17.362 --> 18:19.398
Sit.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.767
{\an3}Maybe I'll try
Mr. Parnell's number again.

18:35.647 --> 18:39.384
{\an3}Andrea, hey, come on,
Revolution's next.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.519
The Revolution?

18:40.586 --> 18:41.653
{\an3}Yeah.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.825
DAVID:
It's hairy.

18:48.827 --> 18:51.830
You guys, it sounds great,
but the park manager

18:51.897 --> 18:53.866
was going to show me
some of the kiddie rides.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.734
{\an1}Kiddie rides?
Well, not to ride on.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.603
But I was thinking,
if I'm going to work

18:57.669 --> 18:58.904
as a camp counselor
again this summer...

18:58.971 --> 19:02.741
{\an5}Andrea...
This place is a perfect place
to bring a group.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.744
{\an5}Andrea...
That is exactly why the manager
was going to show me around.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.745
Andrea!

19:06.812 --> 19:08.647
Guys, I've...

19:08.714 --> 19:11.383
I've never been
on a roller coaster before.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.851
{\an1}Well, there's a first time
for everything.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.152
{\an3}DONNA:
David, no.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.287
You can't force someone

19:15.354 --> 19:16.588
{\an3}to do something
they're afraid of.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.223
What exactly is it
that you're afraid of?

19:18.290 --> 19:19.591
The heights, speed?

19:19.658 --> 19:21.460
Yeah.

19:21.527 --> 19:24.162
Guys, guys, guys, she
can get therapy later.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.464
Let's go.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.799
{\an3}No. Uh, David, why don't
you go by yourself?

19:27.866 --> 19:29.201
Donna...

19:29.268 --> 19:31.436
We'll meet up with you
later, go on.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.839
Hey, Tony, wait up, man.
Excuse me.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.743
Look, you guys don't have
to do this, you know.

19:37.809 --> 19:38.744
{\an3}DONNA:
Yes, we do.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.379
We need a food break.

19:40.445 --> 19:41.847
{\an3}Come on, I'm starving.
Me, too.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.749
Cotton candy?

19:43.815 --> 19:46.919
(people chanting):
We want Burt, we want Burt...

19:46.985 --> 19:48.820
{\an1}You know, one thing
I didn't tell your "clients"

19:48.887 --> 19:50.656
{\an1}was that Samantha Sanders
is my mother?

19:50.722 --> 19:51.857
Yeah?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.959
{\an1}Well, not only that,
but she once did a cameo

19:54.026 --> 19:55.861
{\an1}for Burt when he was filming
<i>Smokey and the Bandit.</i>

19:55.928 --> 19:57.563
Oh, no kidding.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.765
Yeah, I've met him.
I met him several times,

19:59.831 --> 20:01.567
and I think Burt's in town.

20:01.633 --> 20:02.901
{\an1}If he knew all these
people were here

20:02.968 --> 20:04.903
{\an1}and they came all
the way from Arizona...

20:04.970 --> 20:06.705
Don't you ever
stop, Steve?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.407
{\an1}Don't you have some SAT
studying to do?

20:08.473 --> 20:10.342
Doesn't he ever stop what?

20:10.409 --> 20:11.877
{\an1}You can't believe
a word he says.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.979
I mean, one day
he's a hot shot music agent,

20:14.046 --> 20:16.982
then he's a computer hacker,
then a drag racer.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.851
Today, he's Burt Reynolds'
best friend.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.220
Can I talk to you
outside, please?

20:22.287 --> 20:23.355
Excuse us.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.690
We'll be right back.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.864
I have had it with your
holier-than-thou attitude, man.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.833
You have no idea about
what makes me tick.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.269
{\an3}Sorry to burst your bubble,
Steve, but the mystery's gone.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.537
{\an3}You're practically
transparent.

20:38.604 --> 20:39.938
I wonder if Kelly
would agree with that.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.907
Why don't we ask her sometime.
Maybe I will.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.842
Steve, you don't care if
Ginger's in trouble or not.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.310
Man, we both know
what's going on here.

20:45.377 --> 20:46.678
{\an1}All right, and you're
a saint, right?

20:46.745 --> 20:47.779
{\an1}Picking up on Kelly
behind Brenda's back?

20:47.846 --> 20:49.881
{\an3}Look, let's just leave
Kelly out of it, all right?

20:49.948 --> 20:50.882
No, let's not.

20:50.949 --> 20:51.850
{\an3}What's on your
mind, Steve?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.385
{\an6}You wanna know
what's on my mind?
Yeah.

20:53.452 --> 20:56.388
{\an5}The only thing bigger than
the chip on that shoulder
is the hair on your head.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.889
{\an1}And you think you're
twice as slick.

20:57.956 --> 21:00.392
Steve, when you were a kid,
your mom used to tie a pork chop

21:00.459 --> 21:03.028
around your neck just so the dog
would come in and play with you.

21:03.095 --> 21:03.929
{\an3}You remember that,
I do.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.999
Hey, you guys seen Ginger?

21:07.065 --> 21:09.668
{\an1}She just borrowed
your car, man.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.037
She borrowed my car?
Yeah, she took off.

21:13.972 --> 21:15.841
Oh, my God.
She just stole my car.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.610
What?
She just stole my car!

21:18.677 --> 21:19.745
Go call the cops.

21:19.811 --> 21:20.879
{\an3}Come on Steve,
let's go after her.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.414
Where are ya going?

21:22.481 --> 21:23.749
{\an1}Get in the car, man!
I am!

21:23.815 --> 21:25.017
The 'Vette's faster!

21:25.083 --> 21:26.585
{\an3}Look man, I don't
think so, all right?

21:26.652 --> 21:29.421
I can't find my keys!
Get in the car!

21:31.990 --> 21:33.959
(tires squealing)

21:51.743 --> 21:53.011
{\an1}Steve, slow down
a little bit, will you?

21:53.078 --> 21:54.713
Chill out.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.081
Come on man, you're
gonna kill us both.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.716
{\an3}If I'd wanted
a backseat driver,

21:57.783 --> 21:59.818
{\an3}I would have bought a car
with a backseat, all right?

21:59.885 --> 22:02.020
Steve, this ain't a video game!

22:02.087 --> 22:04.956
STEVE:
Mach one.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.058
{\an1}(truck horn blaring)
Whoa, look out!

22:06.958 --> 22:08.794
Whoa!

22:08.860 --> 22:11.063
Mach two!
What're you doing, man?

22:11.129 --> 22:13.432
Any closer and you would've
kissed that guy, come on!

22:15.100 --> 22:16.802
{\an3}I feel like Starsky
and Hutch, man.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.904
(laughing)

22:18.970 --> 22:20.939
Interception imminent.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.041
Pull over!

22:25.077 --> 22:27.012
What was that?

22:27.079 --> 22:28.547
{\an3}That was the heartbeat
of America.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.049
My God, what did
you do that for?

22:31.116 --> 22:32.317
I almost hit you.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.986
Maybe we should've just let the
cops catch up with you instead.

22:35.053 --> 22:35.921
What?

22:35.987 --> 22:36.988
Car theft is a felony,

22:37.055 --> 22:37.956
{\an1}you know that,
don't you?

22:38.023 --> 22:41.960
What, you mean...
you think I stole his car?

22:43.095 --> 22:45.597
No, Brandon lent me his keys.

22:45.664 --> 22:46.998
{\an3}He did not lend
you his keys.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.900
You stole his keys.
You stole his car!

22:48.967 --> 22:50.435
You stole the car.
I already said that.

22:50.502 --> 22:52.804
No, no, not really.
I just...

22:56.875 --> 22:59.478
I don't know why I did
such a stupid thing.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.614
{\an3}I guess I figured that
if I got to Parnell's office,

23:02.681 --> 23:05.984
maybe I could get the money
to pay the Peach Pit bill

23:06.051 --> 23:08.086
and maybe even give the fan club
their money back.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.991
But I didn't steal the car,
honest.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.626
You gotta believe me.

23:14.693 --> 23:17.462
{\an1}So say we give you
the benefit of the doubt.

23:17.529 --> 23:18.964
What doubt, Steve?

23:19.030 --> 23:20.432
{\an1}Let's just go
to Parnell's office.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.067
We'll get to the
bottom of this.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.735
Oh, thank you.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.036
You guys are wonderful.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.071
Just follow me.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.875
{\an3}You slide over.
I'm driving.

23:29.941 --> 23:33.545
What about me?
What about you?

23:41.253 --> 23:44.790
{\an3}Andrea, maybe if you tried
a kiddie roller coaster first.

23:44.856 --> 23:45.957
No, that's a mistake.

23:46.024 --> 23:48.727
It's like entering a cold
swimming pool an inch at a time.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.162
With each step you die
a thousand deaths.

23:50.228 --> 23:51.863
Yeah, you're right.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.032
It's definitely better to just
jump right in, one fell swoop.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.767
Yeah, that way
you only die once.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.003
How much do I owe you, Donna?

23:58.069 --> 23:59.671
Uh, $4.50.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.108
What's wrong?

24:03.175 --> 24:05.644
My wallet's gone.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.979
I had it when
I got on the bus.

24:08.046 --> 24:09.948
{\an1}What about when you
got off the bus.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.883
I don't know.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.752
Maybe someone turned it
into the lost and found.

24:13.819 --> 24:17.022
Great.

24:17.088 --> 24:19.925
Somebody found it all right.

24:19.991 --> 24:21.026
Empty.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.195
{\an3}Yeah, right outside
the gate in front of our bus.

24:23.261 --> 24:25.063
Well, do you think it was
someone from our school?

24:25.130 --> 24:26.531
It looks that way.

24:26.598 --> 24:27.599
I feel so stupid.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.934
I mean, I had
everything in here.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.636
My credit cards, my money.

24:31.703 --> 24:34.673
You know, in my next lifetime,
remind me to ditch Ditch Day.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.179
DYLAN:
What is Parnell's address?

24:41.246 --> 24:43.582
{\an1}GINGER:
He said 15045.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.792
{\an1}This was the address
he gave me.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.035
{\an3}Haven't you actually ever
been to his office?

25:04.102 --> 25:08.039
{\an1}I got the job
over the phone.

25:08.106 --> 25:09.608
Nice office.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.978
{\an1}Oh, God, how could
I be so naive?

25:13.044 --> 25:13.845
I've probably gotten involved

25:13.912 --> 25:15.847
with some sort of con man,
haven't I?

25:15.914 --> 25:17.549
Kinda looks that way.

25:17.616 --> 25:20.518
Well, that's just great Ginger.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.821
Now all I have to do
is just find Burt Reynolds

25:22.888 --> 25:23.855
and get him to show up.

25:23.922 --> 25:26.157
Well, that shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.093
{\an3}I mean, Steve's mom
knows the guy.

25:28.159 --> 25:29.794
{\an3}Hell, Steve knows
Burt himself.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.962
Isn't that what
you said, Steve?

25:31.029 --> 25:33.531
Yeah.

25:33.598 --> 25:34.966
You think you could
really do it, Steve?

25:37.168 --> 25:39.037
(both laugh)

25:40.639 --> 25:41.740
I could make some calls.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.119
Yeah, for the third time,

25:54.185 --> 25:57.122
my name is Steve Sanders
of Sanders Management Group.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.657
Look, are you new there or what?

25:58.723 --> 26:00.558
I just want to talk
to Burt Reynolds' publicist.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.827
No, don't put me on hold!

26:02.894 --> 26:04.029
Be sure and tell them

26:04.095 --> 26:06.331
{\an3}about the cameo your mom
did in <i> Smokey and The Bandit.</i>

26:06.398 --> 26:09.935
{\an1}I'm trying to talk here,
do you mind?

26:10.001 --> 26:12.704
(dialing tones)

26:15.106 --> 26:16.975
Hi, Mom, uh...

26:17.042 --> 26:19.044
That's a real
bummer, Kel.

26:19.110 --> 26:23.181
How could I let my wallet get
stolen right from under my nose?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.316
Don't blame yourself.

26:24.382 --> 26:25.583
Yeah, Kel, it's not your fault.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.720
Then how come I feel like the
poster child for Victims-R-Us?

26:28.787 --> 26:30.322
{\an3}Well, there's no use crying
over spilled plastic.

26:30.388 --> 26:32.891
There's still a whole bunch of
rides we haven't been on yet.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.025
David...

26:34.092 --> 26:36.094
Sometimes you are
so insensitive.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.229
No, David's right.

26:38.296 --> 26:39.331
That thief may
have my money,

26:39.397 --> 26:41.232
{\an3}but should I let him
have my fun, too?

26:41.299 --> 26:42.767
Hear, hear.

26:42.834 --> 26:43.835
I am in control

26:43.902 --> 26:45.236
of how much fun
I have, not him.

26:45.303 --> 26:48.139
{\an3}Come on.
You guys coming?

26:48.206 --> 26:49.374
{\an1}You are
absolutely right.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.944
{\an1}I am the one who's
in control of my life.

26:54.946 --> 26:55.981
I'm still chicken.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.615
I'll stay with Andrea

26:57.682 --> 26:59.317
and we'll meet you guys
at The Viper.

26:59.384 --> 27:00.986
{\an3}Okay.

27:05.056 --> 27:06.958
{\an1}Why do they have
to call it "The Viper"?

27:12.163 --> 27:14.232
{\an1}He's been on that phone
a long time.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.102
{\an3}Yeah, nobody slings
the bull quite like Steve.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.104
But you don't, do you?

27:19.170 --> 27:20.872
Too much work.

27:20.939 --> 27:23.408
{\an3}You know, keeping all
those bulls up in the air.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.012
You don't like me, do you?

27:27.078 --> 27:29.247
I don't know you.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.219
You know, my name's
not really Ginger.

27:34.285 --> 27:35.353
{\an3}Really?

27:35.420 --> 27:37.956
It's Tina.

27:38.023 --> 27:41.393
{\an1}I got into a little bit
of trouble back home.

27:41.459 --> 27:43.294
{\an1}Nothing illegal
or anything, just, um...

27:43.361 --> 27:47.966
{\an1}socially unacceptable
behavior for a small town.

27:48.033 --> 27:52.303
Oshkosh isn't exactly
as open-minded as Beverly Hills.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.838
Don't believe the brochures.

27:53.905 --> 27:58.676
{\an1}Anyway, I said, "So long,
Oshkosh, hello L.A."

27:58.743 --> 28:01.112
I just wanted to start over.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.681
New town, new identity.

28:03.748 --> 28:04.883
Know what I mean?

28:04.949 --> 28:07.285
Yeah, yeah, I left once.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.188
{\an3}Sometimes the walls can get
closing in on you pretty fast.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.891
Yeah, they do.

28:12.957 --> 28:15.860
{\an3}Struck out,
huh, champ?

28:15.927 --> 28:17.395
{\an1}Well, that's the chance
you take

28:17.462 --> 28:18.930
{\an1}when you swing
for the fences, right?

28:18.997 --> 28:20.031
Thanks for trying.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.200
Course, how else you gonna hit
it out of the park?

28:22.267 --> 28:23.935
Burt Reynolds can be found
at the Calvert Studios.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.171
{\an1}He's filming
his new movie there.

28:26.237 --> 28:27.172
Son of a....

28:27.238 --> 28:28.173
Steve, that's great!

28:28.239 --> 28:29.207
You did it!

28:29.274 --> 28:31.309
{\an1}Dylan, did you hear that,
he did it!

28:31.376 --> 28:33.344
What am I, chopped liver?

28:37.282 --> 28:39.150
(laughs)

28:46.391 --> 28:48.893
Maybe it's not my fear
of heights and speed.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.328
{\an3}I mean, I definitely
have those.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.930
{\an3}It's not like
I'm a daredevil,

28:51.996 --> 28:53.298
{\an3}but, I don't know,
maybe it's more

28:53.364 --> 28:54.866
of my fear of the unknown.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.334
Could be.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.470
You've been on it, right?

28:58.536 --> 28:59.971
Definitely.

29:00.038 --> 29:01.372
So, what's it like?

29:01.439 --> 29:08.146
Um, scary, thrilling, huge.

29:08.213 --> 29:11.216
Andrea, it is
totally awesome.

29:11.282 --> 29:14.085
Is that all?

29:14.152 --> 29:15.854
No, really,

29:15.920 --> 29:18.189
{\an1}it's this incredible rush
of excitement

29:18.256 --> 29:20.992
{\an1}that just soars through
your body.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.760
{\an1}You don't know
what's happening,

29:22.827 --> 29:24.996
but you're loving it so much

29:25.063 --> 29:29.267
{\an1}and it's this unbelievably
amazing feeling

29:29.334 --> 29:31.870
that you don't want to end.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.538
And then when it does,

29:33.605 --> 29:37.542
{\an1}you kinda get
this wild feeling all over

29:37.609 --> 29:40.912
{\an1}and you wanna do it over
and over again.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.881
I have to admit

29:42.947 --> 29:45.216
you have definitely
piqued my curiosity.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.417
Yeah.

29:46.484 --> 29:51.556
God, I bet
it's the next best thing to...

29:51.623 --> 29:57.195
Well, I mean, it must feel
like when you have.....

29:57.262 --> 29:59.898
Have sex?

29:59.964 --> 30:02.901
Yeah, I guess.

30:02.967 --> 30:03.902
I hope so.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.470
Wait a minute.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.971
You and David haven't....

30:07.038 --> 30:09.274
No.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.376
Not yet.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.546
I mean, we almost did once.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.414
Actually almost did twice.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.116
Me, too.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.585
Well, almost once.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.453
Really? With who?

30:22.520 --> 30:25.890
{\an1}I'm-I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.559
That's okay.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.527
It was with Brandon.

30:29.594 --> 30:31.563
{\an3}Just before
the Walsh family

30:31.629 --> 30:32.530
{\an3}was gonna move back
to Minnesota.

30:32.597 --> 30:37.135
We, uh... I don't know,
we realized it just,

30:37.202 --> 30:38.970
it wasn't the right thing.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.240
Maybe we should've just done it.

30:42.307 --> 30:46.144
No, you probably did
the right thing.

30:46.211 --> 30:49.480
I mean, in a way, it's sort
of like a roller coaster.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.883
You have to decide
what ride to take,

30:51.950 --> 30:55.486
when to take it
and who to take it with.

31:01.226 --> 31:04.629
Look, Mr. Neck, Burt knows me.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.297
He really does.
We're like this.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.567
Just tell him Samantha Sanders'
son is here, okay?

31:09.634 --> 31:10.635
Come on, Steve.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.537
Okay, but boy,
is he gonna be mad

31:12.604 --> 31:14.005
{\an3}when he finds out
you didn't let us in.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.441
{\an3}Down, boy.

31:16.507 --> 31:18.209
{\an6}WOMAN:
Any more extras
lying around?

31:18.276 --> 31:20.878
It's now or never.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.617
(laughs)

31:28.086 --> 31:30.021
I started the day studying
for the SAT's

31:30.088 --> 31:32.156
and now look at me, Steve.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.291
I'm Kermit the Frog.

31:33.358 --> 31:34.926
With a rash.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.594
(both laugh)

31:36.661 --> 31:38.563
What in the world are we
supposed to be, anyway?

31:38.630 --> 31:41.633
What does it matter
as long as it gets us in?

31:41.699 --> 31:44.902
{\an1}Okay, all you bacteria
in here, please.

31:44.969 --> 31:47.672
{\an3}Bacteria?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.173
(both laugh)

31:49.240 --> 31:50.942
Come on, man.

31:51.009 --> 31:52.577
{\an4}WOMAN:
Come on.
Let's move it.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.512
{\an1}Yeah, I found the bacteria.
They're flying in.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.380
Come on, people,

31:55.446 --> 31:57.382
{\an1}we're laughing our way
to midnight here.

31:57.448 --> 31:58.650
Time is money.

31:58.716 --> 32:02.120
{\an3}Okay, listen up, people.
When I yell "action,"

32:02.186 --> 32:05.623
{\an3}I want all you bacteria
to start painting

32:05.690 --> 32:09.360
only your assigned tooth with
these buckets of plaque here.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.696
Hey, who's talking people?

32:11.763 --> 32:15.667
Thank you. There we go.

32:15.733 --> 32:18.069
{\an3}Excuse me, babe,
where is Burt, anyway?

32:18.136 --> 32:19.304
{\an1}Burt finished his scene
this morning.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.472
{\an1}He's over
at Rossmore Sound now.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.274
{\an3}Great work, Steve.
So what've you got us

32:23.341 --> 32:24.976
{\an3}booked for next?
A nasal spray commercial?

32:25.043 --> 32:26.944
You're certainly
dressed for it, man.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.981
Okay people, very quiet,

32:30.048 --> 32:31.983
Action, bacteria.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.988
{\an1}Painting, painting,
painting.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.593
Painting, painting.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.670
Okay, cue the mouthwash!

32:54.339 --> 32:56.641
(mouthing)

33:00.712 --> 33:04.082
(extras shrieking)

33:15.660 --> 33:17.662
{\an3}I loved it when the
guy came out screaming,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.230
{\an3}"Look out for
the dental floss!"

33:19.297 --> 33:20.231
{\an3}(screeches)

33:20.298 --> 33:21.466
I thought I was going

33:21.532 --> 33:23.067
to die until you grabbed
onto that rope.

33:23.134 --> 33:25.069
That was no rope.
That was the uvula.

33:25.136 --> 33:26.771
It's that small, fleshy,
useless skin

33:26.838 --> 33:28.439
that hangs in the back
of your throat,

33:28.506 --> 33:29.741
kind of looks like
a punching bag.

33:29.807 --> 33:31.309
Uvula; it's a noun.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.744
Very good, Steve.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.178
(siren blips)

33:34.245 --> 33:37.782
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:41.085 --> 33:41.786
BOTH:
Uh-oh.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.726
{\an3}You didn't call Brandon,
did you, Steve?

33:48.793 --> 33:51.195
Brandon who?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.733
This car belong to you folks?

33:55.800 --> 33:58.803
Actually, it belongs
to a friend of ours.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.271
He let us borrow it.

34:00.338 --> 34:02.140
Is that why your friend
reported it stolen?

34:02.206 --> 34:04.742
Well, actually there was
a little mix-up, Officer.

34:04.809 --> 34:07.445
{\an6}OFFICER:
Well, let's just go down
to the station, shall we?

34:07.512 --> 34:09.280
We're very good
at un-mixing things down there.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.692
(phone ringing)

34:21.759 --> 34:23.661
Hang on.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.663
Peach Pit. Steve,
what the hell's going on?!

34:25.730 --> 34:27.764
I've been waiting
to hear from you all day.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.067
Well, I've got good news
and some bad news.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.601
Give me the good news first.

34:31.668 --> 34:32.703
The good news is
we found your car.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.071
You did?

34:34.138 --> 34:35.306
That's killer man!

34:35.373 --> 34:36.641
You wanna hear the bad news?

34:36.706 --> 34:38.208
Do I have to?

34:38.275 --> 34:41.512
They're holding us on suspicion
of grand theft auto.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.786
{\an3}Relax. Steve's in there
talking to Brandon.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.554
{\an3}I'm sure he's not
gonna press charges.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.226
{\an1}Dylan, remember how
I told you

34:55.293 --> 34:57.328
{\an1}I got into some
minor trouble back home?

34:57.395 --> 35:00.498
Yeah.

35:00.565 --> 35:04.268
{\an1}Well, maybe
it wasn't so minor.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.803
Uh-huh.

35:05.870 --> 35:11.142
{\an1}I just wanted you
to hear it from me first.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.845
{\an3}Exactly how
"not so minor" was it?

35:13.911 --> 35:15.546
Dylan McKay?

35:15.613 --> 35:16.781
Yeah.

35:16.848 --> 35:17.849
Ginger O'Hara?

35:17.915 --> 35:18.883
Yes, sir.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.886
You're both free to go.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.189
{\an1}Can we get out
of here

35:25.256 --> 35:26.891
{\an1}before someone
has a change of heart?

35:30.895 --> 35:32.697
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.837
I can't thank you
guys enough.

35:39.904 --> 35:42.206
You could've hung me out to dry
in there and you didn't.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.308
Well, tooth decay has gotta
stick together, right? Let's go.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.877
Uh, Steve.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.778
{\an3}I can't believe you're
still willing to help me

35:47.845 --> 35:49.447
{\an3}after all I've
put you through.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.883
{\an4}Rossmore Sound's only
a few blocks away.
It's worth a shot.

35:51.949 --> 35:53.751
{\an3}I think you better
call it a day, Steve.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.820
{\an3}And wimp out now?
What are you crazy?

35:55.887 --> 35:57.355
Come on, we've
come this far.

35:57.421 --> 35:58.723
Yeah, but aren't you
forgetting something?

35:58.789 --> 36:00.691
You know, it starts with "D,"
rhymes with "T,"

36:00.758 --> 36:01.859
as in Mrs...

36:01.926 --> 36:03.194
{\an1}Detention.
I forgot all about it.

36:03.261 --> 36:04.829
{\an1}Forgot what?
If you leave right now,

36:04.896 --> 36:07.899
you can still make it.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.500
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.202
But what about finding
Burt Reynolds?

36:11.269 --> 36:12.937
I can't. I'll get expelled.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.640
Dylan knows where this place is,
he'll take you over there.

36:15.706 --> 36:17.775
But he doesn't
know Burt Reynolds, you do.

36:19.777 --> 36:22.213
Isn't there some way?

36:28.753 --> 36:29.887
Melinda Rawlings?

36:29.954 --> 36:31.956
{\an3}Yeah.
Good.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.825
{\an3}Eric Reeves?
Here.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.762
David Arsemel?
Yeah.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.830
Henry Cho?
Yo.

36:39.897 --> 36:42.867
{\an1}Barbara Horowitz?
Here.

36:42.934 --> 36:46.437
Steve Sanders?

36:46.504 --> 36:47.805
Steve Sanders?

36:47.872 --> 36:50.942
Here.

36:55.913 --> 36:58.683
{\an3}How many times can they go
around on that thing?

36:58.749 --> 37:00.851
{\an3}Just watching it
makes me nauseous.

37:00.918 --> 37:03.654
{\an1}Well, with David on board,
there is no telling.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.990
{\an3}I'm gonna get a soda.
You want anything?

37:06.057 --> 37:07.858
No, I'm fine, thanks.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.498
Hey, what're you doing?
Give it to me, blondie.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.701
He's stealing her purse!

37:17.702 --> 37:18.936
No!

37:20.771 --> 37:22.273
{\an1}Hey, hey.

37:23.608 --> 37:24.542
Are you okay?

37:24.609 --> 37:25.676
I'm fine, I'm fine.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.713
{\an3}Just get him out of here
before I let him make my day.

37:28.779 --> 37:32.016
{\an1}All right buddy, you made
a big mistake, pal, that's it.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.017
{\an1}Come on.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.853
{\an1}I can't believe
you did that.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.955
{\an3}Me neither.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.924
It was great.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.928
{\an5}WOMAN:
<i>Rossmore Sound.</i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

37:45.663 --> 37:47.665
{\an3}Aw, Burt didn't
remember you, did he?

37:47.732 --> 37:51.769
{\an1}If he were there,
he would've remembered me.

37:51.836 --> 37:53.504
I'm sorry.

37:53.571 --> 37:54.939
{\an3}You did all
you could. Thanks.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.407
{\an1}I guess there's
nothing else to do

37:56.474 --> 37:57.975
but go back to the Peach Pit

37:58.042 --> 37:59.777
and fess up.

37:59.844 --> 38:00.945
I can't.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.547
That president will turn me
into the cops like she said.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.983
{\an1}Why? The only thing
you did wrong

38:06.050 --> 38:07.685
{\an1}was get hired by
J. Thomas Parnell.

38:07.752 --> 38:11.055
{\an3}You know that old saying
about killing the messenger?

38:11.122 --> 38:13.024
{\an1}You can't just walk away
from the problem.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.893
Why not?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.428
Listen, it's Friday.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.664
We've got the whole
weekend ahead of us.

38:19.730 --> 38:22.767
Why don't we just hop in your
'Vette and cruise up to Vegas?

38:22.833 --> 38:23.968
Yeah, right.

38:24.035 --> 38:24.902
I'm serious.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.637
I know some people up there.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.907
We could have a great time.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.980
Look, Ginger, forgetting about
the fan club for just a minute,

38:36.047 --> 38:38.783
{\an1}and forgetting about
how gorgeous you are...

38:38.849 --> 38:41.485
{\an1}what are we gonna do
in Vegas without any money?

38:43.120 --> 38:48.859
{\an3}Well, it just so happens
I have $2,500 right in here.

38:48.926 --> 38:51.896
You've had $2,500 in
your purse all this time

38:51.962 --> 38:54.031
and you didn't use it
to pay your bill

38:54.098 --> 38:55.766
at the Peach Pit

38:55.833 --> 38:58.903
{\an1}or even refund the money
for the fan club?

38:58.969 --> 39:06.077
{\an3}Look, Steve, I'm really gonna
level with you now.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.979
My name's not Ginger.

39:09.046 --> 39:11.449
It's Adrienne.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.985
I had some trouble back home
in Salt Lake, so I came to L.A.

39:15.052 --> 39:17.988
{\an3}You know, fresh city,
fresh start, fresh name.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.724
One thing led to another

39:19.790 --> 39:22.960
{\an3}and I got hooked up
with Parnell...

39:23.027 --> 39:25.429
What's the use.

39:25.496 --> 39:31.502
Look, it's a very long,
very convoluted story.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.004
I didn't want to give that money
back till I was absolutely sure

39:34.071 --> 39:35.940
{\an3}we'd exhausted
every possible avenue.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.009
{\an3}You've got to
believe me, Steve.

39:39.076 --> 39:39.810
And driving to Vegas?

39:39.877 --> 39:42.012
How does that fit
into your plans?

39:42.079 --> 39:45.149
I panic sometimes.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.885
Well, Adrienne...

39:47.952 --> 39:50.721
you know what we have to do?

39:50.788 --> 39:52.690
Fly to Vegas?

39:52.757 --> 39:54.058
{\an3}Kidding.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.694
Just, just kidding.

39:58.929 --> 40:02.066
So, you see, I was trying
to do everything humanly

40:02.133 --> 40:03.200
{\an1}and inhumanly
possible

40:03.267 --> 40:06.537
to make this visit everything
it was supposed to be

40:06.604 --> 40:08.706
and everything you paid your
hard-earned money for.

40:08.773 --> 40:12.109
{\an1}So, on behalf of J. Thomas
Parnell Celebrity Tours,

40:12.176 --> 40:16.080
I'd like to offer you our
humblest, abject apology.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.092
And just to show you
how truly sorry I truly am

40:28.159 --> 40:32.062
since the bus was late,
the motel wasn't booked

40:32.129 --> 40:33.764
{\an3}and the film festival
got cancelled

40:33.831 --> 40:36.567
and since you missed getting to
meet Burt Reynolds in person...

40:36.634 --> 40:37.902
Look, it's Burt!

40:37.968 --> 40:39.603
(crowd gasping)

40:39.670 --> 40:42.439
{\an3}We left no stone unturned
in finding for you,

40:42.506 --> 40:45.609
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Reynolds.

40:45.676 --> 40:46.911
Hi, how are ya?

40:46.977 --> 40:47.978
Where's Nat?

40:48.045 --> 40:49.113
He's out sick today, sir.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.881
Who are you?
I'm Brandon.

40:50.948 --> 40:51.982
Hi. Nice to see you.

40:52.049 --> 40:52.983
Steve Sanders,
Mr. Reynolds.

40:53.050 --> 40:54.185
We met years ago.

40:54.251 --> 40:56.787
My mom did a cameo for you
on <i> Smokey And The Bandit.</i>

40:56.854 --> 40:58.622
{\an1}Oh, really? You're not
my son are you?

40:58.689 --> 40:59.790
I'm just kidding,

40:59.857 --> 41:01.158
{\an1}Tell your mom
she owes me one.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.092
You're a great kid.

41:02.159 --> 41:03.894
{\an1}Get off my stool.
That's my favorite stool.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.163
{\an1}STEVE:
It's his favorite stool.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.532
Okay, just give me the names.

41:08.599 --> 41:09.733
{\an3}Heidi.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.136
Oh, Heidi.
Heidi, I love Heidi...

41:12.203 --> 41:13.938
{\an5}ANDREA:
You guys, you should've
seen her.

41:14.004 --> 41:15.706
{\an1}"Make my day,"
she says to him.

41:15.773 --> 41:17.107
Didn't bat an eyelash.

41:17.174 --> 41:19.009
That was dangerous.
You could've gotten hurt.

41:19.076 --> 41:21.178
{\an3}I know, but I
just got so mad.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.047
{\an1}And the security guys,
they were great.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.049
{\an1}I mean, they were
right on top of it.

41:25.115 --> 41:26.217
Well, I don't think
Dean Anderson's

41:26.283 --> 41:27.484
gonna be graduating with us.

41:27.551 --> 41:28.485
You can count on that.

41:28.552 --> 41:30.788
Yeah, well, at least you
got all your stuff back.

41:30.855 --> 41:32.156
Yeah, thanks to Donna.

41:32.223 --> 41:35.092
{\an5}No, thanks to Brenda
for making me take that
self-defense class.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.560
You're welcome.

41:36.627 --> 41:39.263
{\an1}All right, you guys,
it's time to hit the road.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.200
You guys...

41:44.969 --> 41:47.271
There's just one more thing
I have to do.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.940
(screaming)

42:21.338 --> 42:23.240
DAVID:
<i>We almost missed the bus</i>

42:23.307 --> 42:25.609
{\an1}'cause we couldn't
get Andrea off the Viper.

42:25.676 --> 42:28.145
You guys, I never believed
anything could feel that great.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.847
Well, besides...

42:29.914 --> 42:31.315
Besides what?

42:31.382 --> 42:35.219
Oh, honey, go put something
on the juke box, okay?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.891
Well, it sounds like you guys
had a great time at Ditch Day.

42:40.958 --> 42:41.725
I'm sorry I missed it.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.994
I can't believe you
met Burt Reynolds.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.729
{\an1}GINGER:
He was terrific.

42:45.796 --> 42:48.265
{\an1}When he found out about the
screening the fan club missed,

42:48.332 --> 42:50.734
{\an1}he just picked up
the phone, and like that,

42:50.801 --> 42:52.236
{\an1}he's taking them
to a screening

42:52.303 --> 42:53.904
of <i> Cop-And-A-Half</i> tonight,

42:53.971 --> 42:55.906
{\an1}and a live taping of
<i>Evening Shade</i> tomorrow.

42:55.973 --> 42:57.341
Oh, I love that show.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.109
{\an1}He sounds like
a really great guy.

43:02.046 --> 43:04.014
{\an1}Um, excuse me, I have
to go use the restroom.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.685
I think you know
where it is.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.853
So, Dylan, are you ready
for the SAT's tomorrow?

43:09.920 --> 43:11.021
Yeah.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.856
{\an3}I actually got
a little time to cram

43:12.923 --> 43:14.892
{\an3}toward the end of the day
thanks to Steve.

43:14.959 --> 43:18.062
This time you won't forget to
write your name on the test.

43:18.128 --> 43:19.596
Shut up.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.065
Excuse me, are you Brandon?

43:21.131 --> 43:23.934
The waitress here says that you
might know Marla Crawford.

43:24.001 --> 43:26.270
Sorry, can't say I do.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.305
I knew I made a mistake
with that girl.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.140
Knew it right in my gut.

43:30.207 --> 43:31.976
Now I'm gonna have
to call the cops.

43:32.042 --> 43:33.377
Cops?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.346
Yeah, she's got $5,000
of my money.

43:35.412 --> 43:37.982
{\an1}Well, just in case
she shows up,

43:38.048 --> 43:39.984
you can give me a call
at this number.

43:42.419 --> 43:45.122
ALL:
J. Thomas Parnell.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.157
Yeah, I've been arranging
celebrity tours in this town

43:47.224 --> 43:48.859
for over 20 years.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.295
Well, J, why don't you, uh, stay
here for just one minute.

43:51.362 --> 43:52.363
Gentlemen.

43:57.001 --> 43:58.335
Oh, Ginger.

43:58.402 --> 43:59.737
Tina..

43:59.803 --> 44:01.071
Adrienne.

44:01.138 --> 44:02.706
(toilet flushing)

44:07.911 --> 44:09.380
ALL:
Oh, Marla...

44:16.453 --> 44:18.922
I'm Marty. Who wants to know?

44:18.989 --> 44:22.960
(engine starting)

44:23.027 --> 44:25.195
(engine revving)

44:27.331 --> 44:31.969
(tires squealing)

44:32.036 --> 44:33.404
Where are your keys?!
Where are your keys?!
