[dance music playing over speakers]

00:20.603 --> 00:24.524
[Billie] There was a time in my life
when I felt free.

00:25.942 --> 00:29.195
And the world was full of possibilities.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.408
Especially him.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.083
Hey, boyfriend.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.209
Hey.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.968
-[Billie] Wait, what are you doing?
-Do you want me to stop?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.470
[moans]

00:54.971 --> 00:56.347
Or should I keep going?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.350
Fu...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.102
Yes.

01:01.811 --> 01:02.937
[moaning]

01:04.230 --> 01:05.356
[Billie] Those were the days.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.319
People say you don't know them
when you're having them, but I knew.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.029
Oh, you're killing me.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.114
You know that?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.157
Mm-hm.

01:14.741 --> 01:15.867
[Billie laughs]

01:16.451 --> 01:17.911
[Billie] Time of your life, baby?

01:19.329 --> 01:20.872
Yes, please.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.714
[Billie moaning]

01:32.842 --> 01:34.219
[yelps]

01:35.428 --> 01:37.013
[grunts] Jesus.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.102
You are killing me.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.521
You know that?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.023
Yeah.

01:48.399 --> 01:51.486
And now, these are the days.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.323
And everything is so different.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.537
Mommy, you said you were feeding her.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.955
I am feeding her.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.041
-No, you're sleeping.
-Okay.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.546
You know what?
I fell asleep for, like, a second.

02:09.629 --> 02:13.299
-But what do you need?
-I want to show you something.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.302
You wanna show me something?

02:17.720 --> 02:20.223
[chuckling] What do you wanna show me?

02:20.306 --> 02:22.225
Come on, Mommy.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.394
[Billie] All right, I'm coming.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.479
[upbeat music playing]

02:34.988 --> 02:35.864
Hudson?

02:38.449 --> 02:39.284
What--?

02:42.245 --> 02:44.581
What have you got there, honey?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.000
Look, mariposa.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.587
Oh, my gosh.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.547
Baby.

02:52.630 --> 02:56.467
You can't keep him like that, sweetheart.
You have to let him go.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.677
It's a girl.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.681
Okay. All right. But still.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.850
And she's mine. I love her.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.061
I know, sweetheart.
But she can't breathe in there.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.565
And she's gonna die
if you don't let her out.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.818
Come here. Come with me.

03:13.902 --> 03:14.986
Let's go sit down.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.197
Come here, angel.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.115
All right.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.787
Look at that baby.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.830
Okay, now.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.333
I have an idea.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.836
Let's see which way she goes, okay?

03:32.921 --> 03:33.963
Mmm.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.507
South, probably. Yeah?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.760
Thousands of miles for the winter.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.310
[both gasp]

03:48.061 --> 03:49.103
Wow.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.814
There it is!

03:52.815 --> 03:54.108
Go wave to her.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.401
Bye, butterfly!

03:55.485 --> 03:57.320
[Cooper] Munchkins! Where are my babies?

03:58.196 --> 03:59.948
Where's my babies? Get over here, bud.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.450
Come on. Where are they? Come here, bud.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.452
[grunting]

04:04.535 --> 04:07.914
-My word, you are so gigantic and cute.
-[Hudson laughing]

04:07.997 --> 04:12.085
Oh, I can barely hold you up!

04:12.794 --> 04:13.920
Missed you, buddy.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.050
Oh, there she is.
There's my beautiful girl.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.889
Yeah. Hey, sweetie.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.975
Look at you.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.436
-Hey.
-Hey!

04:30.520 --> 04:34.065
I was gonna get dressed
at some point, I swear. I just--

04:34.148 --> 04:35.858
Ah, it's no biggie.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.947
All right. I'm gonna hurry up
and mow the lawn before the game starts.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.283
Oh, yeah.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.577
-You good?
-Yup.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.037
-All good.
-Huddie!

04:48.121 --> 04:51.207
[Billie] My husband is
as gorgeous inside as out.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.333
Wait for me.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.295
I've never caught him
looking at another woman.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.507
Hell, I've never even caught him in a lie.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.011
So, what's the problem, right?

05:04.512 --> 05:05.680
[Cooper exhales]

05:07.181 --> 05:10.977
Oh, God, Billie,
things have been so crazy at work.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.062
You have no idea.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.188
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:14.272 --> 05:19.235
I mean, we're talking like,
it's, like, post-merger madness, you know?

05:19.319 --> 05:22.405
Everybody's just angling for a position

05:22.488 --> 05:26.784
and they're all trying to show off
for the new boss.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.370
And she's great, though, you know? She's--

05:29.871 --> 05:31.539
She wants to expand internationally.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.916
She wants to do all those things
I've wanted to do,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.045
just on a-- I don't know,
like a much, much larger scale.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.006
Wow.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.299
[Cooper] Yeah.

05:41.382 --> 05:45.762
You know, people are swarming,
but she sees me, I can feel it.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.265
What?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.268
Nothing.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.355
I just miss you.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.774
-[cell phone ringing]
-Excuse me.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.904
Okay, and that's her.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.656
My new boss.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.700
Come on.
Have you listened to a word I said?

06:07.784 --> 06:09.619
-Right.
-Francesca, hey!

06:09.702 --> 06:11.245
How are you? [laughs]

06:11.329 --> 06:15.917
[Billie] The problem is
Cooper Connelly is married to me.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.086
And before I met him,

06:18.169 --> 06:23.091
I'd been contorted into at least 73%
of the positions in the Kama Sutra.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.427
As should we all.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.179
-There were rich guys.
-[moaning]

06:29.222 --> 06:30.473
Poor guys.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.601
Tattooed guys.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.813
Just-flying-through guys.

06:37.855 --> 06:42.568
And every other kind
of bad boy deliciousness you can imagine.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.575
We'll just talk tomorrow and set a time,
then we'll discuss.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.413
All right, great. Thanks.
We'll see you then. Bye.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.083
She loves me.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.549
-[Cooper whistling]
-Who doesn't?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.553
So why go marry someone so straight-laced?

07:09.762 --> 07:12.640
Honestly, because of them.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.934
I didn't call you back for a reason!

07:15.017 --> 07:16.144
I see a lot of women.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.854
Open the goddamn door, Billie!

07:18.479 --> 07:19.856
[moaning]

07:19.939 --> 07:20.940
Holy--

07:21.023 --> 07:24.152
You never appreciated anything that I did.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.153
Hello?

07:27.655 --> 07:30.700
My nerves were so fucking shot
by the time I met Cooper,

07:30.783 --> 07:32.785
my heart was riding on fumes.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.247
And the stability and sanity he offered

07:36.330 --> 07:40.751
was a soothing balm
to my spent, scorched soul.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.462
[uplifting music playing]

07:42.545 --> 07:45.631
I'll never forget the first time
he brought me to this house.

07:46.424 --> 07:50.094
It's actually an Algonquin word,
"Connecticut."

07:50.678 --> 07:53.264
"Land of the long tidal river."

07:53.973 --> 07:55.183
I always loved that.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.411
There she is.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.383
[Billie laughs]

08:29.467 --> 08:31.427
-What do you think? Yeah?
-Wow.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.431
It's like he'd been waiting for me.
For us.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.185
[shouting] Yep! Ha!

08:40.311 --> 08:43.397
Can't have you tracking snow
in the house, come on, now.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.235
[Billie exclaims] Oh, my God!

08:48.069 --> 08:50.863
He cooked me this incredible meal.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.117
I mean, come on.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.873
How could you
not fall in love with this guy?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.334
-May I?
-Yes.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.508
It's nice to finally meet you.

09:11.259 --> 09:15.054
I've heard so much about the both of you.
I'm a big fan of your daughter's. Clearly.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.682
-Us too.
-Most days, anyway.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.933
Mom.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.935
-She's joking.
-Or I'm not.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.311
Well, you'll see.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.481
[Billie] Cooper is the kind of guy

09:25.565 --> 09:28.317
who actually enjoys dinner
with your parents.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.529
[man over PA] This is North Station.
North Station.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.948
Ma'am, ma'am.
Why don't you sit right here?

09:34.031 --> 09:37.743
[Billie] He stands on the train,
no matter how many seats are empty.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.661
Yeah?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.832
-Have a great day.
-And somehow

09:42.915 --> 09:48.254
manages to be the most handsome
and humble man in any room.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.380
Gotta say,

09:50.464 --> 09:54.093
never thought I'd leave Morgan Stanley
to come be one of the good guys.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.177
[all chuckling]

09:55.261 --> 09:59.640
But Cooper sucked me in
with his "change the world" hoo-ha.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.977
And the dental plan's not that bad either.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.895
[all laughing]

10:04.979 --> 10:08.941
-But we have had a very big year.
-We have.

10:09.525 --> 10:14.488
High risk, high reward, so huzzah to you.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.327
-Merry fucking Christmas, dude.
-Thanks, buddy. Appreciate you.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.412
[applause]

10:28.252 --> 10:31.172
[Billie]
He is my all-time favorite person.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.257
[inaudible dialogue]

10:34.884 --> 10:39.847
And I want us to live a hundred years
and die at the exact same moment.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.560
[applause]

10:45.269 --> 10:47.104
-[Cooper] Push!
-[Billie grunting]

10:49.106 --> 10:50.358
Oh, there he is!

10:51.400 --> 10:53.653
-Hey, buddy!
-[baby crying]

10:54.195 --> 10:55.488
Hi!

10:56.697 --> 10:57.615
Hi!

10:57.698 --> 11:00.242
I know, I know. Okay, go see Mommy.
Go see Mommy.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.369
Hey, bud!

11:01.869 --> 11:02.703
Hey!

11:03.788 --> 11:05.331
Oh, my God.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.874
[Billie] And I want our souls

11:06.957 --> 11:10.086
to find each other on the other side
as soon as possible,

11:10.169 --> 11:14.090
so we can fall in love
and make more babies,

11:14.173 --> 11:17.259
and do it all over again.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.680
I just also want him
to fuck my brains out.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.058
Is that so much to ask?

11:24.141 --> 11:26.143
[man speaking indistinctly over TV]

11:27.103 --> 11:27.978
Hey.

11:29.146 --> 11:33.859
Didn't you have the, um...?
No, no, no! Stop him!

11:37.363 --> 11:41.117
I'm sorry. Didn't you have the--?
The girls night in tonight?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.493
Yeah, but you know...

11:42.576 --> 11:44.578
-Um...
-[sensual music playing]

11:45.329 --> 11:47.581
-I can be late.
-Oh. [chuckles]

11:47.665 --> 11:50.209
-Okay.
-Oh. Okay.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.671
Okay. Mm-hm.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.673
[Billie] Oh, yeah.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.967
Oh, yeah. [moaning]

11:59.427 --> 12:01.846
Oh, it's so good. That feels so good.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.309
So good.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.864
Are you--? Are you okay?

12:20.656 --> 12:21.657
Yes.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.160
Yeah, no, don't stop.
Don't stop. Keep going.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.619
-Okay.
-Keep going.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.787
Okay.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.330
[moaning]

12:30.541 --> 12:31.834
[Cooper grunts]

12:34.211 --> 12:35.880
Shit.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.469
I'm sorry, babe.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.222
-I'm just so tired.
-Yeah.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.730
Okay. Hold on.

12:53.647 --> 12:54.774
-Hold on.
-Okay.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.821
[moaning] Oh, yeah.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.282
Oh, that's good.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.577
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.872
That's good.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.957
Oh, yeah.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.552
-Cooper!
-What?

13:24.136 --> 13:28.140
-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Just-- Okay, just get the vibrator.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.141
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.101
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.063
Okay.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.070
[Billie] It's been 18 months since Cooper
went down on me, for example.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.074
I expelled an entire human being
from my body

13:45.157 --> 13:46.367
in half that time.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.743
[vibrator buzzing]

13:48.953 --> 13:50.120
[moaning]

13:54.124 --> 13:56.126
[vibrator dying, then stops]

13:56.794 --> 13:57.962
Oh, my God.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.130
[baby crying]
