- <font color="#8B814C"><b>GUY</b></font>: Prisca.
- <font color="#8B814C"><b>PATRICIA</b></font>: She's gonna faint.

- Wait. - Prisca. - Mom. Mom!

39:32.218 --> 39:34.955
Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

39:37.389 --> 39:39.559
It's there.

39:39.593 --> 39:42.195
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

Jesus.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.532
- It's grown.
- What?

39:45.564 --> 39:47.400
- What's happening to Mom?
- It's okay.

39:47.434 --> 39:49.202
- Trent, it's okay. It's okay.
- Dad.

39:49.235 --> 39:51.204
- What's happening to Mom?
- Trent, why don't you two guys

39:51.236 --> 39:52.905
go play somewhere else
on the beach, okay?

39:52.939 --> 39:54.575
Okay?
Mom's just a little bit tired.

39:54.608 --> 39:56.209
Would you do that for me, tiger?

- <font color="#8B814C"><b>CHARLES</b></font>: Not possible.

40:02.215 --> 40:03.684
- But it's Guy's call.
- No!

40:03.717 --> 40:05.084
No, no, no. No.

40:05.117 --> 40:06.786

this decision. No.

No, I...

40:09.055 --> 40:11.125

- Do we have alcohol?
- <font color="#8B814C"><b>CHRYSTAL</b></font>: Yes.

40:17.997 --> 40:19.967
Some bottles from the minibar.

40:19.999 --> 40:21.534
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand that, right?

40:21.568 --> 40:23.537
Yes.

40:23.570 --> 40:25.872
Okay. Well, I mean, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

40:25.905 --> 40:27.474
We're gonna have to sew this up.

40:27.506 --> 40:29.108
<font color="#8B814C"><b>PATRICIA</b></font>:
Um, yeah, yeah. Uh...

40:29.142 --> 40:30.877

Is this the right decision?

40:30.910 --> 40:32.279
Maybe we should all
talk about this.

<font color="#8B814C"><b>GUY</b></font>:

40:33.345 --> 40:35.081
This tumor is going to kill her.

Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

Oh, no.

40:46.693 --> 40:47.995

- <font color="#8B814C"><b>JARIN</b></font>: Are you okay?

41:17.189 --> 41:18.958
<font color="#8B814C"><b>JARIN</b></font>:
Cut her again.

41:18.992 --> 41:21.028
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

41:23.162 --> 41:24.865
No. No, I'll take care of her.

41:24.898 --> 41:26.499
Does anyone know
the name of that film?

41:26.532 --> 41:28.934
It was with Jack Nicholson...

41:28.968 --> 41:31.138
and Marlon Brando.

Both!

41:34.139 --> 41:36.308
Oblique incision
on the side of the belly.

41:36.342 --> 41:38.177
Four to six inches.
You can do this.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.050
Put your fingers
inside the incision.

41:43.082 --> 41:44.684

a little wider, please?

That's it.

42:59.425 --> 43:01.227
We took the tumor out.

Can we all agree
I didn't do that?

44:08.461 --> 44:10.030
What happened to her?

44:10.063 --> 44:12.365
<font color="#8B814C"><b>PRISCA</b></font>:
The body has decomposed.

44:12.398 --> 44:14.700
- How quickly can that happen?
- <font color="#8B814C"><b>CHARLES</b></font>: A long time.

44:14.733 --> 44:16.335
Mom knows this stuff.

44:16.369 --> 44:18.671
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

44:18.704 --> 44:21.207
but from excavations
for the museum,

44:21.240 --> 44:24.476
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

44:24.510 --> 44:27.479
My best guess... an exposed body,

44:27.512 --> 44:31.684
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

44:31.718 --> 44:33.687
And this happened in what,
three hours?

44:33.720 --> 44:35.121
I know.

44:35.153 --> 44:37.056
And bones, we found,
will disintegrate

44:37.090 --> 44:39.025
in 30 years more.

44:39.057 --> 44:40.793
<font color="#8B814C"><b>MID-SIZED SEDAN</b></font>:
The hell, man?

44:40.827 --> 44:42.829
On this beach, less than
20 hours after you die,

you just return to dust.

44:45.530 --> 44:47.066
What exactly are we saying?

44:47.099 --> 44:49.201
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

45:37.883 --> 45:39.852

on this beach,

half an hour is equivalent

45:42.387 --> 45:45.090
to something like one year
of our lives.

45:45.124 --> 45:46.760
This must be true for all of us.

45:46.793 --> 45:48.695
We just don't see it
on everyone.

- they wished they were Black.
- Mm-hmm.

45:52.164 --> 45:54.534
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

45:54.566 --> 45:58.537
They need to grow an enormous
amount of mass quickly.

45:58.570 --> 46:00.706
We're staying roughly
the same mass.

46:00.740 --> 46:02.742

at the same time.

46:21.427 --> 46:23.496
<font color="#8B814C"><b>PRISCA</b></font>:
What about our hair and nails?

46:23.528 --> 46:26.265
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

46:26.298 --> 46:28.668
<font color="#8B814C"><b>JARIN</b></font>: Maybe it has to do
with the fact that the cells

46:28.700 --> 46:30.637
in hair and nails are dead

46:30.669 --> 46:33.106
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.

If our cells are being affected,

46:52.992 --> 46:56.528
speeding up in their processes,

46:56.561 --> 46:59.365
then us trying to leave is like

46:59.398 --> 47:03.168
swimming to the surface too fast
after being deep in the ocean.

47:03.202 --> 47:06.039
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

47:06.072 --> 47:08.976
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

47:10.510 --> 47:12.678
Maybe...

47:12.711 --> 47:16.315
we could slowly walk
through the canyon.

Take a step, stand still.
