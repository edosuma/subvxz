01:24.374 --> 01:28.544
<i>Know then the legend of the
hound of the Baskervilles.</i>

01:28.914 --> 01:32.243
<i>Know then that the great
hall of Baskervilles...</i>

01:32.244 --> 01:35.284
<i>was once held by Sir
Hugo of that name...</i>

01:35.285 --> 01:38.625
<i>a wild, profane, and godless man.</i>

01:38.655 --> 01:40.794
<i>An evil man, in truth...</i>

01:40.795 --> 01:44.594
<i>for there was with him a certain
ugly and cruel humor...</i>

01:44.595 --> 01:47.725
<i>that made his name a
byword in the county.</i>

01:50.966 --> 01:53.766
- Our friend learns swiftly.
- Aye.

01:54.376 --> 01:57.275
He's already learned to
fly like a wildfowl...

01:57.276 --> 02:00.236
and now he swims like a waterfowl.

02:04.846 --> 02:07.085
Shall we see how he roasts?

02:07.086 --> 02:08.786
Fetch him.

02:10.487 --> 02:15.447
By morning, our friend will know better
than to condemn the sport of his master.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.097
Come on out. Come on.

02:29.207 --> 02:31.478
Here he comes, Sir Hugo.

02:32.808 --> 02:34.808
Here he is, Sir Hugo.

02:42.418 --> 02:45.287
Now our waterfowl has
become guinea fowl.

02:45.288 --> 02:47.558
Guinea pig, more likely.

02:47.858 --> 02:51.629
Bird or beast, we'll soon make
him sing like a nightingale.

02:52.129 --> 02:53.899
Now, sir....

02:54.999 --> 02:58.208
This may teach you to
criticize my pleasures.

02:58.209 --> 03:00.338
If 'twere anyone but my
own daughter, Master...

03:00.339 --> 03:02.238
You should be proud
that a Baskerville...

03:02.239 --> 03:05.269
should so much as look
at your miserable child.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.120
Pay up!

03:18.430 --> 03:21.800
No, no! The game was spoiled
before the wager was laid.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.630
Do not crowd me, sirs, I pray you.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.230
I will not pay.

03:30.241 --> 03:31.570
What about the wager?

03:31.571 --> 03:33.910
If I must, I must.

03:33.911 --> 03:36.610
- But not in gold.
- Not in gold?

03:36.611 --> 03:40.671
In kind, with a plaything
I was keeping for myself.

03:44.691 --> 03:47.551
I accept. Where is the girl?

03:47.621 --> 03:51.582
Girl? What talk is this of a girl?
I know of no girl.

03:53.632 --> 03:54.731
Enough!

03:54.732 --> 03:59.502
You shall see her at once, and before
Sir Richard bursts with passion.

04:02.842 --> 04:06.502
See to it that there be no
fighting among your herd of rams.

05:02.265 --> 05:04.795
The bitch has got away.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.865
What does she think I am,
that she does this to me?

05:10.176 --> 05:11.876
Damn her!

05:15.846 --> 05:17.736
I have her now.

05:18.116 --> 05:20.676
You there! Let loose the pack!

05:21.386 --> 05:23.986
And you, my hunter at the door...

05:24.196 --> 05:27.725
- ...set the hounds on her.
- But, sir, you cannot...

05:27.726 --> 05:31.027
The hounds! Let loose the pack!

05:57.958 --> 06:00.597
- Yeah, I'll get her.
- My friend, you cannot do this.

06:00.598 --> 06:02.428
I'll get her!

06:02.698 --> 06:06.088
May the hounds of Hell take
me if I can't hunt her down!

07:21.752 --> 07:23.342
Come on.

07:28.152 --> 07:31.353
Come on, what's the matter
with you? Come on, will you?

08:59.647 --> 09:02.107
Now, you witch!

09:38.929 --> 09:40.319
No.

09:51.810 --> 09:53.909
"And so, the curse of Sir Hugo...

09:53.910 --> 09:56.039
"came upon the Baskervilles...

09:56.040 --> 09:58.840
"in the shape of a
hound from Hell...

09:58.980 --> 10:00.679
"forever to bring misfortune...

10:00.680 --> 10:03.070
"to the Baskerville family.

10:03.450 --> 10:05.289
"Therefore, take heed...

10:05.290 --> 10:10.090
"and beware the moor in those dark
hours when evil is exalted...

10:10.331 --> 10:14.221
"else you will surely
meet the hound of Hell...

10:14.231 --> 10:16.821
"the hound of the Baskervilles.

10:17.401 --> 10:19.531
"So ends the legend."

10:21.101 --> 10:25.801
And what, may I ask, do you
think of that, Mr. Holmes?

10:35.452 --> 10:37.651
There must be hundreds
of similar folk stories.

10:37.652 --> 10:40.721
I fail to see why I should find
this one of singular interest.

10:40.722 --> 10:42.562
What do you say, Watson?

10:43.692 --> 10:47.661
I'm sure Dr. Mortimer's
intentions are for the best...

10:47.662 --> 10:51.002
but there seems little to be
gained from what he's told us.

10:51.003 --> 10:53.942
I had hoped, sir, that the facts
I have laid before you...

10:53.943 --> 10:56.172
might have intrigued
you as a detective.

10:56.173 --> 10:58.503
I was obviously mistaken.

10:58.973 --> 11:00.282
Good day to you, sir.

11:00.283 --> 11:02.882
Dr. Mortimer, it was
something more important...

11:02.883 --> 11:05.552
that brought you from
Devonshire to Baker Street...

11:05.553 --> 11:09.052
something that occurred on Dartmoor
on Friday, the 13th of June.

11:09.053 --> 11:11.493
You've known about it
all the time, then?

11:11.494 --> 11:13.863
I know nothing, except that
you live on Dartmoor...

11:13.864 --> 11:16.963
have a copy of the Devon County
Chronicle in your briefcase...

11:16.964 --> 11:18.033
dated June 14.

11:18.034 --> 11:21.663
That newspaper is published on Saturdays,
but goes to press on Thursday.

11:21.664 --> 11:23.973
You've kept it for something
vitally important.

11:23.974 --> 11:27.473
The headlines aren't interesting,
so it must be in the stop press.

11:27.474 --> 11:31.814
Whatever it was happened on
Friday, the 13th of June.

11:31.815 --> 11:34.644
- But this is remarkable.
- Superficial.

11:34.645 --> 11:37.084
There's nothing remarkable
about using one's eyes.

11:37.085 --> 11:40.854
Now, sir, would you be prepared
to give us the relevant facts?

11:40.855 --> 11:42.354
Why, yes.

11:42.355 --> 11:44.694
Under the circumstances,
I think I would.

11:44.695 --> 11:46.585
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

11:46.695 --> 11:48.864
This is just the stop press.

11:48.865 --> 11:51.265
"Devonshire knight found dead.

11:51.266 --> 11:55.065
"The body of Sir Charles Baskerville
discovered on Dartmoor early today.

11:55.066 --> 11:57.405
"Foul play not suspected."

11:57.406 --> 12:00.035
The account in the next
edition is much fuller.

12:00.036 --> 12:01.926
Now, where are we?

12:02.406 --> 12:04.006
Yes, here we are.

12:04.176 --> 12:07.345
"The death of Sir Charles Baskerville
has caused much sadness...

12:07.346 --> 12:09.785
"in the small village
of Grimpen, Dartmoor.

12:09.786 --> 12:12.756
"Dr. Richard Mortimer, a well-known
Devonshire personality...

12:12.757 --> 12:15.556
- "said today that"...
- If you'll pardon me, Dr. Mortimer...

12:15.557 --> 12:19.047
I want just the plain
facts in your own words.

12:20.527 --> 12:21.897
Please.

12:22.627 --> 12:24.057
Very well.

12:24.297 --> 12:27.236
The plain facts of the matter
are that a fortnight ago...

12:27.237 --> 12:30.328
Sir Charles Baskerville was
found dead on the moor.

12:30.508 --> 12:33.207
- Who found him?
- His servant, Barrymore.

12:33.208 --> 12:36.377
He and his wife are housekeepers
up at Baskerville Hall.

12:36.378 --> 12:39.147
He fetched me at once and
took me back to the body.

12:39.148 --> 12:43.317
Where was the body? Dartmoor, I know,
but exactly where? It's a large place.

12:43.318 --> 12:47.748
Near the abbey ruins up on the hill,
not far from Baskerville Hall.

12:47.928 --> 12:50.659
The place where Sir Hugo
died in the legend...

12:51.129 --> 12:54.499
and the circumstances
were exactly the same.

12:54.929 --> 12:56.968
You mean Sir Charles
had been attacked?

12:56.969 --> 13:01.429
- That his throat had been torn out?
- No. The body was untouched.

13:02.509 --> 13:04.369
But his face....

13:05.009 --> 13:10.310
Never in all my medical career have I seen
such a look of horror on a dead person.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.380
Sir Charles must have been
terrified when he died.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.110
But he was alone.

13:16.120 --> 13:20.420
The strange thing was, there
were no footprints, Mr. Holmes.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.259
That cannot be quite true.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.899
There were the servants', for
instance, your own, and Sir Charles'.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.199
Yes, of course, but what
I meant to say was...

13:28.200 --> 13:30.129
there were no other footprints.

13:30.130 --> 13:33.701
Facts are only of value when they're
clear, concise, and correct.

13:33.702 --> 13:35.110
Pray, continue.

13:35.111 --> 13:37.341
And there was another
strange thing.

13:38.041 --> 13:42.810
Sir Charles must've been tiptoeing
back to Baskerville Hall when he died.

13:42.811 --> 13:46.550
I could tell that because the footmarks
showed only the toes of his boots.

13:46.551 --> 13:48.351
There were no heel marks.

13:48.451 --> 13:50.991
I'm something of an archaeologist
in my spare time...

13:50.992 --> 13:53.861
and so I'm used to looking
for the extraordinary.

13:53.862 --> 13:56.291
You have not yet told us
what Sir Charles died of.

13:56.292 --> 14:00.031
Before you do, sir, I suggest
it was heart failure.

14:00.032 --> 14:02.901
The inquest found that he
died of arteriosclerosis...

14:02.902 --> 14:05.702
a disease of the coronary arteries.

14:06.702 --> 14:08.941
A condition of the heart...

14:08.942 --> 14:12.473
that can lead to heart failure.

14:12.513 --> 14:16.152
Yes. I think it must be
hereditary with the Baskervilles.

14:16.153 --> 14:18.822
They all seem to suffer
from the same weakness.

14:18.823 --> 14:20.852
Is there a successor
to the family title?

14:20.853 --> 14:23.413
Yes. Sir Henry Baskerville.

14:23.623 --> 14:26.653
He's due to arrive in London
tonight from Johannesburg.

14:28.593 --> 14:31.733
Why have you come to me,
when you really don't believe...

14:31.734 --> 14:33.763
that I can help you?

14:33.764 --> 14:37.334
- I don't think I know what you mean.
- I think you do.

14:37.504 --> 14:39.204
Excuse me.

14:40.614 --> 14:45.213
Although you knew the cause of death,
you've implied a more horrible death...

14:45.214 --> 14:49.213
that he might have seen the hound of
Hell, the curse of the Baskervilles.

14:49.214 --> 14:51.184
Do you really believe that legend?

14:51.185 --> 14:54.754
There are many things in life and
death that we do not understand.

14:54.755 --> 14:58.394
Then I suggest you consult a
priest instead of a detective.

14:58.395 --> 15:01.094
Do you think I can influence
the powers of darkness?

15:01.095 --> 15:02.334
Of course not.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.264
I thought you might prevent Sir
Henry from going into danger.

15:05.265 --> 15:07.474
If there is an evil
curse on the family...

15:07.475 --> 15:10.405
it can be just as powerful
in London as in Devonshire.

15:10.406 --> 15:14.345
- Where will he be staying?
- At the Northumberland Hotel.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.715
Does this mean that you'll
investigate the matter?

15:16.716 --> 15:19.315
I have not said. My
commitments are heavy.

15:19.316 --> 15:23.285
I beg of you, Mr. Holmes, this
is a matter of life and death.

15:23.286 --> 15:26.286
There can be no harm done
by my seeing the man.

15:26.956 --> 15:29.525
Shall we say 10:00 tomorrow
morning, at the hotel?

15:29.526 --> 15:32.127
Good. That will suit admirably.

15:32.297 --> 15:34.457
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

15:34.497 --> 15:38.165
You will not find me ungenerous
in the matter of fees.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.836
My professional charges
are upon a fixed scale.

15:40.837 --> 15:45.007
I do not vary them, except
when I remit them altogether.

15:45.047 --> 15:46.646
Good day.

15:46.647 --> 15:48.777
Good day, Mr. Holmes.

15:50.948 --> 15:54.618
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Not at all, Doctor.

15:58.088 --> 16:00.258
Good day, Dr. Watson.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.697
I must say, you never cease
to surprise me, Holmes.

16:06.698 --> 16:09.667
First you tear him apart, and
then you say you'll help him.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.738
My dear Watson, you ought
to know me better.

16:11.739 --> 16:14.208
I had to burst the balloon,
deflate his pomposity...

16:14.209 --> 16:15.878
to find one significant clue.

16:15.879 --> 16:18.678
I saw nothing of significance
in anything he said.

16:18.679 --> 16:20.408
I'm surprised you
bothered with him.

16:20.409 --> 16:22.818
Nevertheless, one important
point did emerge.

16:22.819 --> 16:24.988
Didn't you notice anything
odd in what he said?

16:24.989 --> 16:28.018
The only thing I noticed was
that he said Sir Charles...

16:28.019 --> 16:30.589
was tiptoeing about
Dartmoor at night.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.229
That's just it, Watson. Well done,
my boy. But he wasn't tiptoeing.

16:34.230 --> 16:36.929
He was running, running
for his life...

16:36.930 --> 16:39.499
running in panic until
he burst his heart.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.399
Would you mind sorting out a
large-scale map of Dartmoor...

16:42.400 --> 16:46.600
while I find some more tobacco.
This, I think, is a two-pipe problem.

16:56.681 --> 16:58.281
Come in.

17:00.491 --> 17:03.291
So you finally managed to get here.

17:03.991 --> 17:05.829
I didn't know we'd kept you.

17:05.830 --> 17:08.391
Kept me? I sent for you
over 20 minutes ago.

17:09.601 --> 17:13.731
- I think perhaps you've made a mistake.
- I've made a mistake, all right.

17:13.732 --> 17:16.271
The mistake I made was in
ever coming to this hotel.

17:16.271 --> 17:18.810
What did you find out
about my other boot?

17:18.811 --> 17:21.172
They were both here last night.

17:21.512 --> 17:24.881
But nobody knows: the porter,
the maid, the boot boy.

17:24.882 --> 17:28.951
Nobody in this hotel of yours knows
where the other one's gone to.

17:28.952 --> 17:30.722
You're the manager.

17:30.723 --> 17:33.722
Perhaps you'll tell me what
you do with all your boots.

17:33.723 --> 17:38.032
I'm a few minutes late, I'm afraid.
Those confounded horse buses.

17:38.033 --> 17:42.163
However, I see you've all met, we
might as well get down to business.

17:42.203 --> 17:45.232
We have not been given an
opportunity to introduce ourselves.

17:45.233 --> 17:47.502
I'm so sorry. Please, let me.

17:47.503 --> 17:51.043
Sir Henry, let me introduce
Mr. Sherlock Holmes...

17:51.044 --> 17:53.513
Dr. Watson. Sir Henry Baskerville.

17:53.514 --> 17:55.883
I'm afraid you're a
little late, Mortimer.

17:55.884 --> 17:58.844
I've already managed to make
quite a fool of myself.

18:00.154 --> 18:02.553
Gentlemen, I must ask you
to accept my apologies.

18:02.554 --> 18:04.393
Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes.

18:04.394 --> 18:06.153
- How do you do?
- Glad to meet you both.

18:06.154 --> 18:08.593
- I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.
- Say no more.

18:08.594 --> 18:10.864
- It was quite understandable.
- Yes, indeed.

18:10.865 --> 18:14.264
I hope that the missing boot
will turn up very soon.

18:14.265 --> 18:15.464
So do I.

18:15.465 --> 18:19.135
I can understand somebody wanting
to steal a pair of boots, but one?

18:19.435 --> 18:20.804
There it is.

18:20.805 --> 18:23.835
- Please, sit down, gentlemen.
- Why, thank you.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.444
Now, Mr. Holmes....

18:26.445 --> 18:30.245
Dr. Mortimer has, no doubt, explained
why he's asked us to come here.

18:30.246 --> 18:33.855
He has, and I may as well tell you,
I consider him to have been...

18:33.856 --> 18:36.525
somewhat hasty in
asking your advice.

18:36.526 --> 18:39.025
Surely, it was only to
protect your interests.

18:39.026 --> 18:42.065
He has told you of the legend of
the hound of the Baskervilles?

18:42.066 --> 18:45.795
Yes, but I don't attach any importance
to that sort of old wives' tale.

18:45.796 --> 18:48.005
A man after my own heart.

18:48.006 --> 18:51.136
You intend to go down to Devonshire
and live at Baskerville Hall?

18:51.137 --> 18:54.176
I've already come a very long
way to do exactly that...

18:54.177 --> 18:55.876
and nothing is going to stop me.

18:55.877 --> 18:58.646
- You can understand that, surely.
- I can indeed.

18:58.647 --> 19:02.286
The estate must be worth a vast amount.
Exactly how much, Dr. Mortimer?

19:02.287 --> 19:04.986
You will forgive me if I ask
a very personal question?

19:04.987 --> 19:06.586
- Of course.
- Well?

19:06.587 --> 19:10.388
When everything's settled up,
I suppose, close on £1 million.

19:12.558 --> 19:15.267
Did anyone else benefit
under Sir Charles' will?

19:15.268 --> 19:18.667
Yes. He left the
Barrymores £1,000...

19:18.668 --> 19:21.158
which I thought was
rather generous...

19:21.208 --> 19:23.437
and I myself received something.

19:23.438 --> 19:27.037
- How much?
- Is this really necessary?

19:27.038 --> 19:29.208
I would not have asked, otherwise.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.048
Very well.

19:31.049 --> 19:33.469
He left me £40,000.

19:33.979 --> 19:36.118
Then, you see, I was Sir
Charles' best friend.

19:36.119 --> 19:39.819
- Were there no other relatives?
- No.

19:39.989 --> 19:42.858
Sir Henry is the last
of the Baskervilles.

19:42.859 --> 19:45.428
That's why I'm anxious to
safeguard his interests.

19:45.429 --> 19:47.419
Very wise of you.

19:47.499 --> 19:49.468
One thing is certain, Sir Henry.

19:49.469 --> 19:51.869
On no account must you go
down to Devonshire alone.

19:51.870 --> 19:55.069
That's taken care of.
Dr. Mortimer's coming with me.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.839
Dr. Mortimer will have his
practice to attend to.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.110
I can look after
myself, Mr. Holmes.

20:00.440 --> 20:04.679
I must impress upon you that I believe
your life to be in considerable danger.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.379
Now, look, if you attach so
much importance to this...

20:07.380 --> 20:09.849
why don't you come down to
Dartmoor with me today?

20:09.850 --> 20:13.060
- You can pack before the train leaves.
- You're going today?

20:13.061 --> 20:16.890
I can't possibly leave town until
the end of the week at least.

20:16.891 --> 20:18.460
- Watson?
- Yeah.

20:18.461 --> 20:20.831
You're free at the
moment, aren't you?

20:21.271 --> 20:22.970
Yes, I am...

20:22.971 --> 20:24.640
if you think I could do the job.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.710
You're the very man. That's settled.
You'll go down with him.

20:27.711 --> 20:30.110
We'll keep in touch by telegram.

20:30.111 --> 20:33.681
Sir Henry, I am not a man
to overestimate danger...

20:33.682 --> 20:35.711
but I must insist upon one thing:

20:35.712 --> 20:37.912
Under no circumstances...

20:38.122 --> 20:41.752
are you to venture out onto
the moor alone at night.

20:43.692 --> 20:44.991
Very well.

20:44.992 --> 20:47.931
As things have gone this far,
I'll do as you say, for now.

20:47.932 --> 20:50.592
But I'm not yet convinced
that I need the services...

20:50.593 --> 20:52.693
of a detective at all...

20:54.003 --> 20:56.533
unless it'd help me
find my other boot.

20:57.473 --> 21:00.393
Sir Henry, keep perfectly still...

21:00.973 --> 21:03.243
if you value your life.

21:26.264 --> 21:29.073
Move your head. Carefully.

21:29.074 --> 21:31.165
I can't.

21:31.345 --> 21:32.965
You must.

21:50.356 --> 21:51.625
Leave it to me now.

21:51.626 --> 21:55.756
No! Look after him.
Brandy, Mortimer, quickly.

21:58.436 --> 22:00.266
Here you are.

22:05.306 --> 22:07.576
What a filthy thing. Horrible.

22:07.676 --> 22:09.245
You've had a lucky escape...

22:09.246 --> 22:12.686
but we must make certain never to
be caught off our guard again.

22:12.687 --> 22:16.177
Are you suggesting that that thing
was put in there deliberately?

22:16.587 --> 22:19.426
The powers of evil
can take many forms.

22:19.427 --> 22:22.456
Remember that, Sir Henry, when
you're at Baskerville Hall.

22:22.457 --> 22:24.526
Do as the legend tells...

22:24.527 --> 22:28.297
and avoid the moor when the
forces of darkness are exalted.

22:54.129 --> 22:56.598
Are you sure you don't want
a ride to the village?

22:56.599 --> 22:58.898
Quite sure. It'll only take
you out of your way...

22:58.899 --> 23:00.998
whereas it's a short
walk across the moor.

23:00.999 --> 23:03.138
You'd be better off
to go along with us.

23:03.139 --> 23:06.668
Kindly wait until you're spoken to,
and get on with what you're doing.

23:06.669 --> 23:10.108
Whatever you say, but don't blame
me if you get your throat cut.

23:10.109 --> 23:13.479
- What are you talking about, man?
- There's been an escape.

23:13.480 --> 23:17.110
- An escape? When?
- Night before last. Man named Selden.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.610
Nasty customer, from all accounts.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.059
What's all this about?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.589
Forgive me, Sir Henry, you
wouldn't know about it.

23:23.590 --> 23:26.029
One of our largest prisons,
called Dartmoor...

23:26.030 --> 23:28.459
lies only seven miles
across the moor.

23:28.460 --> 23:31.430
It appears that one of the
prisoners has broken out.

23:31.431 --> 23:34.770
Selden. Yes, I remember the case.

23:34.771 --> 23:37.700
He murdered a number
of street women.

23:37.701 --> 23:42.080
- I thought people hanged for murder here.
- There was some talk of him being insane...

23:42.081 --> 23:45.141
so they sentenced him to
life imprisonment instead.

23:45.311 --> 23:47.871
Won't do him no good,
though, escaping.

23:47.981 --> 23:51.851
He'd only starve himself to death
out there, or something worse.

23:51.852 --> 23:55.852
- What do you mean by that?
- Why, nothing, sir.

23:56.262 --> 23:57.822
Just my foolishness.

23:58.192 --> 24:00.731
I feel you should let us
take you into the village.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.131
He might be anywhere out there.

24:02.132 --> 24:05.001
Don't worry about me.
I can look after myself.

24:05.002 --> 24:06.531
Goodbye.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.832
Goodbye.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.533
All right, Perkins.

24:19.983 --> 24:21.722
A curse upon the family...

24:21.723 --> 24:24.692
unhappiness and death
to his descendants.

24:24.693 --> 24:27.083
That's what he left, Sir Henry.

24:27.223 --> 24:29.783
Certainly has a lot to answer for.

24:29.993 --> 24:32.324
What about this one here?

24:32.734 --> 24:35.033
That was another
picture of Sir Hugo.

24:35.034 --> 24:38.203
It disappeared under mysterious
circumstances some months back.

24:38.204 --> 24:41.003
- You mean it was stolen?
- In the middle of the night.

24:41.004 --> 24:43.243
And what steps were
taken to recover it?

24:43.244 --> 24:48.274
Your uncle called in the police from
Exeter, but they could find no trace.

24:49.484 --> 24:52.475
One picture of that scoundrel
is more than enough.

24:52.755 --> 24:55.085
What do you say, Watson?

24:55.225 --> 24:57.345
Your glass is empty. Please....

24:57.525 --> 25:00.854
You must be bored to tears by all
this rigmarole about my family.

25:00.855 --> 25:03.864
- You must think me a terrible host.
- Not at all.

25:03.865 --> 25:06.794
- I've found it extremely interesting.
- Have you?

25:06.795 --> 25:08.804
It's very nice of you to say so.

25:08.805 --> 25:11.235
- Barrymore.
- Sir?

25:11.236 --> 25:14.005
Would you and your good wife
care to join me in a toast?

25:14.006 --> 25:16.806
That's most kind of you, Sir Henry.

25:19.776 --> 25:23.116
Let us drink to my first
day at Baskerville Hall...

25:23.416 --> 25:25.015
and to my firm belief...

25:25.016 --> 25:28.316
that the family curse is
nothing but a legend...

25:28.486 --> 25:31.326
and that the hound of Hell
will never again bring fear...

25:31.327 --> 25:33.457
to those on the moor at night.

25:43.937 --> 25:46.906
I must ask you to excuse my
wife's behavior, Sir Henry.

25:46.907 --> 25:49.446
She was most upset by
Sir Charles' death.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.517
Her nerves have been in
a bad way ever since.

25:51.518 --> 25:53.647
I'm very sorry to hear that.

25:53.648 --> 25:56.447
Watson, can you give her
something for her nerves?

25:56.448 --> 25:58.617
Yes. Yes, of course. I will.

25:58.618 --> 26:00.957
Barrymore?

26:00.958 --> 26:03.157
Since you've mentioned
Sir Charles' death...

26:03.158 --> 26:05.797
perhaps you could tell us
a little more about it.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.327
You were the first to discover
the body, weren't you?

26:08.328 --> 26:11.968
That's correct.
It was terrible, sir.

26:11.969 --> 26:15.829
I never saw such a dreadful
look on anybody's face before.

26:16.439 --> 26:21.499
You found Sir Charles' body up
near the old Abbey, I understand.

26:21.509 --> 26:23.908
What made you go up
there to look for him?

26:23.909 --> 26:25.378
I didn't, sir.

26:25.379 --> 26:29.619
I was on my way to tell Dr. Mortimer
that he was missing, and then I....

26:29.819 --> 26:33.359
Then I saw Sir Charles
lying there dead.

26:33.360 --> 26:38.129
But what made you decide to go across
the moor to look for Sir Charles?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.790
I've had a look at a
map of the locality...

26:40.800 --> 26:44.869
and surely it would've been quicker to
have taken the trap and gone by road.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.930
There's a shortcut
across the moor, sir.

26:48.110 --> 26:49.770
Barrymore...

26:49.910 --> 26:54.780
did you go across the moor because you
half expected to find Sir Charles...

26:54.781 --> 26:57.011
because of the legend?

26:57.451 --> 27:01.541
You know about the legend of the hound
of the Baskervilles, don't you?

27:01.591 --> 27:03.611
Do you believe it?

27:04.091 --> 27:08.321
Do you really believe that
there is a creature out there?

27:08.761 --> 27:11.462
I don't know what to believe, sir.

27:11.962 --> 27:14.732
What I know is that
I've heard it...

27:14.932 --> 27:19.171
heard its terrible howl on the
night before Sir Charles died...

27:19.172 --> 27:22.542
and I never want to hear such
a sound again in all my life.

29:00.047 --> 29:02.876
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, thank you.

29:02.877 --> 29:06.146
It's got away. Damn it. I
could've done with that.

29:06.147 --> 29:09.686
Excellent specimen of
Coleoptera scabrus.

29:09.687 --> 29:11.887
I collect them, you know.

29:11.888 --> 29:14.657
- Why, it's Sir Henry.
- It is.

29:14.658 --> 29:18.797
Yeah, the Baskerville mouth. I could
have recognized you anywhere...

29:18.798 --> 29:20.297
even among the natives.

29:20.298 --> 29:22.237
Frankland is the name.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.567
Frankland, Bishop of
the outer isles...

29:25.568 --> 29:27.367
for what they're worth.

29:27.368 --> 29:29.777
Very glad to meet you, sir.
Won't you come in?

29:29.778 --> 29:31.469
Thank you.

29:36.319 --> 29:38.618
Yes. How good.

29:38.619 --> 29:43.509
How very good to see a new
owner of Baskerville Hall.

29:43.819 --> 29:47.928
That's not quite what I meant....

29:47.929 --> 29:49.528
Poor Sir Charles.

29:49.529 --> 29:52.599
What a splendid fellow he was.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.799
So you knew my uncle?

29:53.800 --> 29:56.999
Knew him? My dear fellow,
we were the greatest friends.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.130
How many times Sir Charles and I
have discussed life, you know...

30:02.810 --> 30:05.770
over a glass of sherry.

30:06.150 --> 30:09.679
In that case, perhaps you'd care to
join me in a glass of sherry now.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.590
Now you've mentioned sherry...

30:12.591 --> 30:15.011
I think perhaps I
might like a glass.

30:15.661 --> 30:18.460
I saw Bishop Frankland coming
up the drive, Sir Henry.

30:18.461 --> 30:20.421
Barrymore...

30:20.461 --> 30:23.331
still the faithful retainer.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.401
Thank you.

30:27.471 --> 30:30.140
- For you, Sir Henry?
- No, thank you, Barrymore.

30:30.141 --> 30:33.041
"That's the best sherry
in Devon," I always say.

30:33.042 --> 30:36.181
Sir Charles knew his creature
comforts, all right.

30:36.182 --> 30:40.281
Seen him with some very
attractive creatures at times.

30:40.282 --> 30:43.882
Yes, he knew a woman when he
saw one, did Sir Charles.

30:44.582 --> 30:47.512
Yes. Poor fellow.

30:47.522 --> 30:49.682
May he rest in peace.

30:49.862 --> 30:51.623
What a loss.

30:53.093 --> 30:56.802
Thank you. I think I should
like another glass, yes.

30:56.803 --> 30:59.663
Watson, I don't think
you've met the Bishop.

30:59.733 --> 31:03.442
- Bishop Frankland, Dr. Watson.
- How do you do?

31:03.443 --> 31:07.342
Watson, you say the name is?
Yes, I knew a Watson in Caprina.

31:07.343 --> 31:11.683
Yes, a notorious white slaver. Nice
fellow, though. Relation of yours?

31:11.684 --> 31:14.753
No, sir. Not that I know of.

31:14.754 --> 31:17.284
But, of course, it is possible.

31:17.424 --> 31:20.823
You've come to approve the new
Lord of the manor I imagine?

31:20.824 --> 31:22.693
- It's not necessary.
- Thank you.

31:22.694 --> 31:24.933
But why have I come?

31:24.934 --> 31:28.633
- Yes, of course. The jumble sale.
- Jumble sale? What on earth's that?

31:28.634 --> 31:32.874
It's a colloquial expression,
Sir Henry. A sale of oddments.

31:32.875 --> 31:36.374
And I was wondering if you had
anything you could spare for us.

31:36.375 --> 31:40.774
An odd tablecloth or an old
suit or some cast-off silver?

31:40.775 --> 31:42.914
I'm sure I can.
I'll ask Mrs. Barrymore.

31:42.915 --> 31:44.384
That's very kind of you.

31:44.385 --> 31:49.254
May I give you the address in
which you could have them sent?

31:49.255 --> 31:52.625
I'm sure we shall all be
very grateful to you...

31:52.626 --> 31:56.795
very grateful, indeed, if
you'd have them sent there.

31:56.796 --> 32:00.135
Now, I shan't apologize
for the tract.

32:00.136 --> 32:02.135
It's really rather charming.

32:02.136 --> 32:04.896
"All things bright and beautiful."

32:05.036 --> 32:06.075
Thank you.

32:06.076 --> 32:10.976
I'm just going down to the village to
leave instructions at the post office.

32:10.977 --> 32:12.876
If you'll excuse me,
my Lord Bishop.

32:12.877 --> 32:18.047
Of course. I'd give you a lift on the
tricycle but I wanted to chat with Sir Henry.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.156
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

32:20.157 --> 32:23.356
I'm afraid you'll be expected
to open the sale, Sir Henry...

32:23.357 --> 32:26.596
and judge the prettiest
mother and baby.

32:26.597 --> 32:29.866
Do you know, dear old Sir
Charles, he loved doing that?

32:29.867 --> 32:31.397
Yeah. He did, indeed.

32:31.398 --> 32:36.137
I remember one occasion when
one of the babies wet....

32:36.138 --> 32:38.938
Dear.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.310
Don't move. Stay where you are.

33:27.690 --> 33:29.960
I said not to move, sir.

33:36.501 --> 33:39.740
You've no call to use that kind
of trap. It's unnecessarily cruel.

33:39.741 --> 33:40.940
A man's got to live.

33:40.941 --> 33:43.640
There are ways of killing
animals without torturing them.

33:43.641 --> 33:45.911
Why don't you use a gun?

33:50.552 --> 33:53.181
- I'm sorry.
- Besides, cartridges cost money.

33:53.182 --> 33:57.582
Some of us haven't got any to spend.
It's a poor life on the moor, Sir Henry.

33:57.922 --> 34:00.661
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
My name is Watson...

34:00.662 --> 34:02.631
though I'm staying
at Baskerville Hall.

34:02.632 --> 34:05.022
- With Sir Henry?
- Yes.

34:05.462 --> 34:08.762
Tell the new squire his new
neighbor would like to meet him.

34:08.831 --> 34:12.502
I farm the lower pastures near the hall.
Have done for nearly a year.

34:12.503 --> 34:14.402
Poor land it is, too.

34:14.402 --> 34:17.242
- What name is it?
- Stapleton.

34:17.243 --> 34:19.081
Very well. I'll tell Sir Henry.

34:19.083 --> 34:23.712
I wonder, could you tell me how
to get to Baskerville Hall?

34:23.713 --> 34:27.713
- I seem to have lost my way.
- You'll bear right at the fork.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.592
Thank you.

34:29.592 --> 34:30.953
Mr. Watson....

34:30.954 --> 34:34.092
Don't step off the track or you'll
find yourself in Grimpen Mire.

34:34.094 --> 34:36.484
Once in there, you'll
never get out.

34:37.864 --> 34:39.563
Thank you.

35:05.665 --> 35:07.495
Good morning.

35:09.395 --> 35:14.536
I wonder, could you tell me, am I on
the right path to Baskerville Hall?

35:14.836 --> 35:17.296
The track seems to end here.

35:24.476 --> 35:25.915
Watch out!

35:25.916 --> 35:27.546
The mire!

35:38.797 --> 35:40.527
I say!

35:51.408 --> 35:53.748
Cecile, come back!

35:56.648 --> 35:58.238
Hold on.

36:26.909 --> 36:29.618
You wait, my girl, I'll teach
you to come when I call.

36:29.619 --> 36:31.649
Get the cart down as
near here as you can.

36:31.650 --> 36:35.150
Be quick about it. Will you
do as you're told, girl?

36:36.720 --> 36:38.990
I told you to watch out.

36:40.030 --> 36:42.899
- Who is that girl?
- My daughter.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.320
The moor's no place for a girl.

36:46.170 --> 36:50.060
- What was she frightened of?
- There's a convict escaped from the prison.

36:50.100 --> 36:53.961
I'll help you to the cart.
Watch where I step.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.821
Thank you.

37:10.822 --> 37:14.161
Now that you're here, would you
like to come in and see Sir Henry?

37:14.162 --> 37:18.701
- It's as good a time as any.
- How about Miss Stapleton?

37:18.702 --> 37:22.362
- Would she like to come in, too?
- She'll wait where she is.

37:22.442 --> 37:23.971
Very well.

37:23.972 --> 37:26.702
Well, good morning, Miss Stapleton.

37:39.193 --> 37:40.713
Hello.

37:40.753 --> 37:43.692
If you're looking for the new
owner, he's not at home.

37:43.693 --> 37:45.523
Go away.

37:45.893 --> 37:49.263
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm Henry Baskerville.

37:49.403 --> 37:52.324
- May I ask...
- Please, go away.

37:53.174 --> 37:55.903
My father will be out in a moment.

37:55.904 --> 37:58.103
So your father's
gone into the hall?

37:58.104 --> 38:00.874
- Let's join him.
- No. Don't.

38:01.244 --> 38:03.114
Here. You wait a minute.

38:12.695 --> 38:16.825
- Leave me alone!
- Just a minute! Calm down!

38:18.165 --> 38:20.535
Now, why did you run away?

38:20.595 --> 38:23.804
Why did you run away?
I've done nothing to frighten you.

38:23.805 --> 38:26.474
- My father.
- What about your father?

38:26.475 --> 38:29.775
- He would have seen us.
- What of it?

38:36.646 --> 38:38.986
Now, would you let me go?

38:39.056 --> 38:40.616
Cecile!

38:48.596 --> 38:50.727
Where have you been?

38:51.297 --> 38:54.097
Come on, girl. Where have you been?

38:54.797 --> 38:57.166
- Good morning.
- Morning.

38:57.167 --> 38:59.236
- Sir Henry Baskerville, isn't it?
- Yes.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.236
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

39:01.237 --> 39:03.746
My name is Stapleton.
Welcome to Dartmoor.

39:03.747 --> 39:06.416
- You're very kind.
- I run the home farm.

39:06.417 --> 39:08.886
You'll be very welcome
whenever you're that way.

39:08.887 --> 39:11.718
We must be getting on our
way, mustn't we, Cecile?

39:13.318 --> 39:15.527
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.

39:15.528 --> 39:18.328
Come on!

40:43.012 --> 40:44.852
Watson, here.

40:47.982 --> 40:50.583
Move the candle about. Quickly.

40:50.923 --> 40:55.193
I swear I saw a light out there on the
moor as soon as you picked up the candle.

40:57.133 --> 40:59.963
Someone out there is signaling
to the house. Come.

41:12.514 --> 41:15.934
Whatever happens, Sir Henry,
you must stay with me.

41:31.735 --> 41:35.364
- We're still in line with the light.
- Yes, but we're not near enough yet.

41:35.365 --> 41:39.065
Keep close to me. Don't go off left,
or you'll be in Grimpen Mire.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.085
Right?

41:51.086 --> 41:52.546
Come on.

41:56.326 --> 41:59.486
Come out! We're armed!

42:02.266 --> 42:04.096
They've gone.

42:04.396 --> 42:07.066
Whoever they are, they
must have heard us.

42:09.906 --> 42:11.277
Watson!

42:12.477 --> 42:15.137
Come on! There's still a chance.

42:29.427 --> 42:31.518
No, no. Quiet. Listen.

42:31.598 --> 42:33.968
He's down there somewhere.

42:41.708 --> 42:44.598
What was that, Watson?
What was that?

42:53.089 --> 42:54.949
It's my heart.

42:55.119 --> 42:57.219
Drink some of this.

43:03.929 --> 43:07.029
Will you be able to get
back if I help you?

43:07.869 --> 43:09.499
I'll try.

43:09.539 --> 43:11.400
Come on, then.

43:20.350 --> 43:22.619
That is for me to
decide, Sir Henry.

43:22.620 --> 43:24.649
I suggest that you
have a little rest.

43:24.650 --> 43:27.520
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:32.661 --> 43:35.230
I really don't know why you
bothered to send for me.

43:35.231 --> 43:39.321
After all, as a doctor, you're
just as capable as I am.

43:39.471 --> 43:42.000
Does your diagnosis confirm mine?

43:42.001 --> 43:44.640
He has a similar heart condition
to his uncle, agreed.

43:44.641 --> 43:48.770
Hereditary, no doubt, but
nowhere near so far advanced.

43:48.771 --> 43:52.542
All the same, I'd like to leave him
in your charge until I get back.

43:53.082 --> 43:54.481
If you insist.

43:54.482 --> 43:58.821
Anyway, my night's sleep is ruined, but
I really can't see that it's necessary.

43:58.822 --> 44:01.321
Nevertheless, I'd appreciate
it if you would stay.

44:01.322 --> 44:04.192
It's essential that I
go back to the moor.

44:04.592 --> 44:06.752
All right. I'll stay.

45:15.166 --> 45:17.936
Why have you left Sir Henry alone?

45:19.836 --> 45:21.136
Holmes.

45:21.276 --> 45:24.076
I repeat, why have you
left Sir Henry alone?

45:24.546 --> 45:25.845
Dr. Mortimer is with him.

45:25.846 --> 45:29.116
- Anyone else?
- Yes. The Barrymores.

45:30.146 --> 45:31.546
Very well, then.

45:31.547 --> 45:33.986
Forgive me if my dramatic
entrance startled you.

45:33.987 --> 45:36.956
It's good to see you again.
It's been rather lonely up here.

45:36.957 --> 45:38.986
This is fantastic.

45:38.987 --> 45:40.596
How long have you been in Devon?

45:40.597 --> 45:42.766
Four hours and 52
minutes less than you.

45:42.767 --> 45:45.166
I caught the next train
down after yours.

45:45.167 --> 45:46.736
But your telegram...

45:46.737 --> 45:50.206
I wrote that before I left town
and had it delivered later.

45:50.207 --> 45:52.338
So it was you I saw.

45:52.538 --> 45:55.477
You might have let me know
what you intended to do.

45:55.478 --> 45:58.047
I'm sorry, but I didn't
want it known I was here.

45:58.048 --> 45:59.877
You would have tried to prevent me.

45:59.878 --> 46:03.587
- You will understand, I had to find Selden.
- Selden, the convict?

46:03.588 --> 46:07.048
- That was madness.
- No doubt, but effectual.

46:07.658 --> 46:11.328
- How did you know he was on the moor?
- I read about it in the newspapers.

46:11.329 --> 46:14.498
The escape was well-reported.
I'm surprised you didn't notice it.

46:14.499 --> 46:17.369
He told me all he had seen
since he's been hiding.

46:17.370 --> 46:20.029
What had he seen?
What did he tell you?

46:20.599 --> 46:25.939
There is more evil around us here
than I have ever encountered before.

46:26.079 --> 46:27.639
I still don't see...

46:49.530 --> 46:52.300
Mortimer's gone.
His ponycart's not there.

46:52.301 --> 46:55.331
- You told him to stay with Sir Henry?
- Indeed, I did.

47:10.392 --> 47:14.282
Which way? For heaven's
sake, which way?

47:24.232 --> 47:25.862
Too late.

47:26.272 --> 47:28.972
- We're too late.
- Sir Henry.

47:30.012 --> 47:33.182
Watch out, Holmes.
It's treacherous here.

47:33.183 --> 47:37.143
We must go back and get help,
then come back for the body.

47:37.213 --> 47:39.383
I'm to blame for this.

47:39.823 --> 47:42.692
- I shall never forgive myself.
- I warned him.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.253
What could have possessed him
to come out alone on the moor?

47:46.263 --> 47:48.753
The last of the Baskervilles.

47:49.223 --> 47:51.594
His life was in our hands.

48:02.504 --> 48:06.344
I shall not rest until I destroy
the thing that killed him.

48:24.895 --> 48:27.455
- You're Barrymore, I take it.
- Yes, sir.

48:29.805 --> 48:33.605
Barrymore, I want you to get a
ladder, some rope, and lanterns...

48:33.606 --> 48:36.175
and load them on the cart
within five minutes.

48:36.176 --> 48:37.315
You understand?

48:37.316 --> 48:38.515
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

48:38.516 --> 48:41.015
- Where's your room?
- This way. I'll show you.

48:41.016 --> 48:43.906
And have those
attended to, will you?

48:44.516 --> 48:46.406
Very good, sir.

48:46.726 --> 48:50.526
I'll need a pair of dry stud boots and
a heavy coat before we go out again.

48:50.527 --> 48:51.896
Yes, of course.

48:51.897 --> 48:56.536
You know, Holmes, I can't help feeling
that if I hadn't left Sir Henry alone...

48:56.537 --> 48:59.296
We're to avenge his
death, not mourn over it.

48:59.297 --> 49:01.097
No. This way.

49:37.679 --> 49:39.339
Who's there?

49:40.809 --> 49:44.148
Holmes. For heaven's sake,
when did you get here?

49:44.149 --> 49:46.318
I am glad to see you again.

49:46.319 --> 49:49.049
I am more than glad to
see you, Sir Henry.

49:50.690 --> 49:52.289
Who was it, Holmes?

49:52.290 --> 49:55.189
Who was the poor devil
that died instead of me?

49:55.190 --> 49:59.429
If my deductions are correct,
it was the convict, Selden.

49:59.430 --> 50:02.529
He was a murderer, I know, but
he shouldn't have died that way.

50:02.530 --> 50:06.139
But why him? The curse is only on
the Baskervilles. Is no one safe?

50:06.140 --> 50:09.169
Selden had on the suit you were
wearing when we met in London.

50:09.170 --> 50:12.080
- How did he get them?
- He must've broken in and stolen them.

50:12.081 --> 50:14.341
Possibly, but unlikely.

50:14.351 --> 50:15.510
Sir Henry...

50:15.511 --> 50:18.220
why did Dr. Mortimer leave
so suddenly tonight?

50:18.221 --> 50:21.181
He told me that he'd
stay until I got back.

50:21.351 --> 50:23.381
Stupid row, really.

50:23.621 --> 50:27.090
He kept on about my uncle's death
and the curse on the family, and...

50:27.091 --> 50:30.961
I asked if he was trying to frighten
me and told him to mind his business.

50:30.962 --> 50:33.431
I should like a few words
with Dr. Mortimer sometime.

50:33.432 --> 50:36.371
Excuse me, Sir Henry. Is there
anything else you require?

50:36.372 --> 50:38.971
No, thank you, Barrymore,
not as far as I'm concerned.

50:38.972 --> 50:41.541
- You've prepared a room for Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, sir.

50:41.542 --> 50:45.602
Will you still be needing the ladder
and rope you asked for tonight, sir?

50:45.612 --> 50:47.311
No. Not now.

50:47.312 --> 50:49.721
But I shall want them and
your help in the morning.

50:49.722 --> 50:50.922
Very good, sir.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.822
- Barrymore.
- Sir?

50:52.823 --> 50:55.552
That room at the end of
the corridor upstairs:

50:55.553 --> 50:57.823
Has it been used lately?

51:01.363 --> 51:04.253
- Not for some time, sir.
- I see.

51:04.303 --> 51:07.572
I think you'll find a candle burning
near the window in that room.

51:07.573 --> 51:12.134
Do kindly extinguish it. It's
serving no useful purpose.

51:13.144 --> 51:16.234
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you.

51:19.754 --> 51:21.883
And now, with your
permission, to bed.

51:21.884 --> 51:25.884
Yes. We could all do with
a good night's sleep.

51:31.525 --> 51:36.434
This, I perceive, is Sir Hugo Baskerville,
the man who started all the trouble.

51:36.435 --> 51:39.004
Yes, it is. How the
devil did you know?

51:39.005 --> 51:42.404
Family likeness. There are certain
features that are unmistakable.

51:42.405 --> 51:44.544
What happened to the
picture that hung here?

51:44.545 --> 51:47.244
That one? Nobody knows.
It disappeared some time ago.

51:47.245 --> 51:48.614
Yes.

51:48.615 --> 51:51.646
Yes, of course. It had to.
Stupid of me.

51:52.516 --> 51:54.746
Yes. Good night.

52:01.026 --> 52:04.695
That's strange. There's
nothing there.

52:04.696 --> 52:07.565
I could have sworn that
that was the spot.

52:07.566 --> 52:10.105
It must be more over this way.

52:10.106 --> 52:12.306
No, Watson. You were right.

52:12.307 --> 52:15.007
This was the place. Look at this.

52:17.307 --> 52:19.577
Here's another trace...

52:19.747 --> 52:21.507
and another.

52:22.947 --> 52:25.837
You can see where
they're leading to.

52:28.557 --> 52:30.226
- Barrymore!
- Sir?

52:30.227 --> 52:33.457
Tell Perkins to bring the cart
up to the ruins, then follow us.

52:33.458 --> 52:36.328
- Yes, sir.
- We won't find the body down here.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.640
By heavens, what's
been going on here?

53:24.180 --> 53:27.249
The Baskerville crest,
engraved on the hilt.

53:27.250 --> 53:28.980
Mr. Holmes!

53:36.791 --> 53:39.491
As I thought. Selden.

53:40.731 --> 53:43.121
His body's been mutilated.

53:44.371 --> 53:48.001
Some revolting sacrificial
rite has been performed.

53:49.341 --> 53:54.402
- What depths a human being can sink to.
- What human being could have done this?

53:55.782 --> 53:59.042
That is precisely what
I intend to find out.

54:10.893 --> 54:14.102
- You rang for me, sir?
- I did, Mrs. Barrymore. Sit down, please.

54:14.103 --> 54:17.272
- No, thank you, sir. I prefer to stand.
- As you wish.

54:17.273 --> 54:21.003
I want to ask you and your husband a
few questions, if you don't mind.

54:21.243 --> 54:24.303
- How long have you been married?
- Married?

54:24.343 --> 54:28.182
- Must be almost five years now, isn't it?
- Is that right, Miss Selden?

54:28.183 --> 54:30.844
Yes, sir. We got married about...

54:34.184 --> 54:36.144
Please, sit down.

54:38.754 --> 54:41.223
Your name was Selden before
you married, wasn't it?

54:41.224 --> 54:43.533
And the convict who
escaped was your brother?

54:43.534 --> 54:47.094
- How did you know?
- Your brother told me.

54:47.204 --> 54:51.365
- He's dead, sir, isn't he?
- Yes, I'm afraid he is.

54:51.605 --> 54:52.904
How did it happen?

54:52.905 --> 54:55.474
You gave Selden some of Sir
Henry's clothes, didn't you?

54:55.475 --> 54:56.874
Well, I....

54:56.875 --> 54:59.475
Someone, or something...

54:59.575 --> 55:01.414
mistook your brother for Sir Henry.

55:01.415 --> 55:04.454
You mustn't blame my husband, sir.
I gave him the clothes.

55:04.455 --> 55:07.384
Sir Henry said I might take
them for the village sale.

55:07.385 --> 55:08.884
Buy why should they have them...

55:08.885 --> 55:12.916
when my brother was out on
the moor, cold and hungry?

55:13.526 --> 55:15.416
Thank you, sir.

55:16.096 --> 55:20.905
I know he was bad, sir,
but he was ill, really...

55:20.906 --> 55:23.035
and he was my brother.

55:23.036 --> 55:27.936
You can't leave someone you love
out there, cold and starving.

55:28.076 --> 55:32.046
I understand. It might help you
to know he also told me...

55:32.047 --> 55:34.747
he would never let them
recapture him alive.

55:38.617 --> 55:40.747
Come along, my dear.

55:46.027 --> 55:47.757
Poor woman.

55:47.997 --> 55:51.197
I suppose when Sir Henry and
I arrived here at the hall...

55:51.198 --> 55:53.767
she found it difficult to
get food to her brother.

55:53.768 --> 55:56.337
They arranged a signal with
the candle at the window...

55:56.338 --> 55:58.077
to show him the coast was clear.

55:58.078 --> 56:02.307
Couldn't they be charged with
helping an escaped convict?

56:02.308 --> 56:06.168
They could, but they won't.
I've satisfied the local police.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.087
What's the next move?

56:10.088 --> 56:14.188
"All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small."

56:14.189 --> 56:16.928
I wonder if that
includes tarantulas.

56:16.929 --> 56:18.659
Tarantulas?

56:18.829 --> 56:20.559
But, Holmes....

56:26.709 --> 56:30.939
- A gentlemen to see you, my lord.
- Good, good. Just in time.

56:30.940 --> 56:35.749
Yes, I'm still having trouble with it.
Will you come and have a look at it?

56:35.750 --> 56:40.980
Of course, I'm not an engineering man,
but it seems this eccentric is malaligned.

56:41.320 --> 56:45.519
Or perhaps if this cam were
buffed to another thou or so...

56:45.520 --> 56:48.089
it might make all the
difference, don't you think?

56:48.090 --> 56:50.930
- Or perhaps a shim.
- Graphite grease.

56:50.931 --> 56:52.391
What?

56:52.431 --> 56:56.370
Of course, yes. I have got some.

56:56.371 --> 56:59.140
- Do you know, I never thought of it?
- Allow me.

56:59.141 --> 57:01.001
Thank you.

57:04.111 --> 57:06.101
Yes. Silly of me.

57:06.911 --> 57:08.180
- Yes.
- Thank you.

57:08.181 --> 57:10.672
There you are.
You'll want that. Yeah.

57:10.982 --> 57:12.912
Now let's see.

57:13.592 --> 57:16.561
Wonderful, wonderful.

57:16.562 --> 57:18.761
That's done the trick, yeah.

57:18.762 --> 57:22.291
I wish Mrs. Goodliffe would
leave those windows alone.

57:22.292 --> 57:26.201
Never mind. Take a glass
of sherry before you go.

57:26.202 --> 57:28.001
- Bishop Frankland, I...
- Nonsense.

57:28.002 --> 57:31.972
A little wine, for your stomach's
sake. That's in the Bible.

57:31.973 --> 57:33.342
I think you'll like this.

57:33.343 --> 57:37.382
What do I owe you for your trouble,
and your fare from Exeter, of course?

57:37.383 --> 57:39.782
My Lord, you've mistaken
me for someone else.

57:39.783 --> 57:42.552
No. Only somebody from
Warburton and Crawley...

57:42.553 --> 57:44.252
could have solved that problem.

57:44.253 --> 57:46.652
Nevertheless, I am not from
Warburton and Crawley.

57:46.653 --> 57:49.552
- Not?
- My name is Sherlock Holmes.

57:49.553 --> 57:51.523
I am staying with Sir
Henry Baskerville.

57:51.524 --> 57:55.333
Allow me to shake the hand of the
country's greatest detective.

57:55.334 --> 57:59.133
That case of the Bermondsey
forgery, that was first class.

57:59.134 --> 58:03.343
Thank you. And I am pleased to meet
our most distinguished entomologist.

58:03.344 --> 58:06.543
You've heard of me? How flattering.

58:06.544 --> 58:08.543
I know the directors
of the Regents Zoo...

58:08.544 --> 58:12.814
regard you as the highest living
authority on the study of rare spiders.

58:12.815 --> 58:14.484
Spiders?

58:14.485 --> 58:17.024
It is about that subject
that I have come to see you.

58:17.025 --> 58:21.085
- The species of the genus Theraphosa.
- Tarantula.

58:22.855 --> 58:26.525
Everybody's asking me about
tarantulas these days.

58:27.495 --> 58:29.194
No.

58:29.195 --> 58:31.805
I'm afraid I can't help
you on that subject.

58:31.806 --> 58:33.796
How very disappointing...

58:33.906 --> 58:35.835
because I've found one.

58:35.836 --> 58:40.536
- Found one? Have you, by Jove?
- Dead, fortunately.

58:41.146 --> 58:43.345
Pity. Never mind.

58:43.346 --> 58:46.045
Where did you find it,
somewhere about the village?

58:46.046 --> 58:49.215
- No. In London.
- Up there.

58:49.216 --> 58:50.486
Nevertheless...

58:50.487 --> 58:52.626
it was the same
spider that you lost.

58:52.627 --> 58:55.717
No, impossible. Far too far away.

58:57.627 --> 59:00.536
Are you suggesting that
I've lost a spider?

59:00.537 --> 59:03.406
I'm afraid I am.
You have, haven't you?

59:03.407 --> 59:07.776
You lost a spider sent to you from
the London Zoo about five days ago.

59:07.777 --> 59:12.578
- Are you interested in butterflies?
- My Lord, I must insist.

59:12.848 --> 59:17.648
Will it help if I tell you I am fighting
evil, fighting it as surely as you do?

59:18.588 --> 59:22.517
Yes. Very well. I did
lose a tarantula.

59:22.518 --> 59:26.157
I missed it last Thursday. I've been
worried out of my life ever since.

59:26.158 --> 59:27.427
They're dangerous.

59:27.428 --> 59:31.289
So I understand. But you needn't
worry any longer. The spider is dead.

59:31.529 --> 59:34.698
Now, it is important that you
answer this question correctly.

59:34.699 --> 59:37.708
What visitors did you have on the
day you missed the tarantula?

59:37.709 --> 59:39.329
Visitors?

59:39.539 --> 59:43.178
That's difficult because
Thursday's my at-home day.

59:43.179 --> 59:46.978
I mean, a lot of people like to
look in for sherry and a chat.

59:46.979 --> 59:49.778
Let me see. There was
old Mrs. Smythe.

59:49.779 --> 59:52.210
Poor woman. Drinks.

59:52.320 --> 59:55.219
Yes. Dr. Mortimer before lunch.

59:55.220 --> 59:58.060
Dear old Mortimer. How he talks.

59:58.830 --> 01:00:02.799
The Stapletons to tea.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.030
The man about the
woodworm in the belfry.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.799
Fascinating little creatures. But the
church is full of them, you know?

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.370
I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
And the man's name?

01:00:12.371 --> 01:00:15.080
- Smith, I think.
- And no one else?

01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:16.780
Last Thursday? No.

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:19.180
Thank you, my Lord,
that is all I wish to know.

01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:21.480
It has been most kind of
you and most helpful.

01:00:21.481 --> 01:00:24.520
And thank you for helping
me with my telescope.

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:27.060
- Not at all.
- Remarkable instrument.

01:00:27.061 --> 01:00:31.131
It's surprising what you can
see through a good telescope.

01:00:31.132 --> 01:00:34.892
Now, what's going on
in the big world?

01:00:35.902 --> 01:00:37.671
There's Sir Henry.

01:00:37.672 --> 01:00:39.692
Where's he off to?

01:00:39.872 --> 01:00:44.032
Dear me, this is very interesting.

01:00:44.172 --> 01:00:46.041
Come have a look.

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:49.242
Come here. Come have a look.

01:00:54.023 --> 01:00:56.653
He's gone.

01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:15.194
Anybody at home?

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.444
Mr. Stapleton?

01:01:31.325 --> 01:01:33.485
Why did you come here?

01:01:33.965 --> 01:01:37.894
I'm sorry. You must think me
very rude, but I did knock.

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:39.494
I've come to see your father.

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.934
He's not here. He's gone
to Baskerville Hall.

01:01:41.935 --> 01:01:44.734
Has he? May I ask why?

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:47.444
To invite you and your
friends to dinner tonight.

01:01:47.445 --> 01:01:49.705
That's very kind of him.

01:01:51.476 --> 01:01:53.715
Would you like some cider?

01:01:53.716 --> 01:01:56.136
Thank you very much. I would.

01:02:01.256 --> 01:02:03.695
What time are we
expected to arrive?

01:02:03.696 --> 01:02:06.256
You mean, you will come?

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.926
I'm looking forward to it.

01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:11.387
It won't be like Baskerville Hall.

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:17.067
I haven't spent all my life
at Baskerville Hall, Cecile.

01:02:17.807 --> 01:02:21.446
- I like your home.
- This is not my home.

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:23.577
My home is in Spain.

01:02:25.847 --> 01:02:28.946
You were looking at the
picture of my parents.

01:02:28.947 --> 01:02:31.408
My mother was a fine woman...

01:02:31.658 --> 01:02:33.818
a fine Spanish woman.

01:02:34.658 --> 01:02:37.027
She would hear nothing
of living in England.

01:02:37.028 --> 01:02:40.188
She was born in Spain, and
there she would die, she said.

01:02:40.228 --> 01:02:42.498
She did die.

01:02:42.528 --> 01:02:44.488
We came here to England.

01:02:45.838 --> 01:02:48.707
My father spent all the
money we had saved...

01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:53.509
to come back to England to become a
gentleman farmer in his own country.

01:02:54.179 --> 01:02:56.439
But the land he bought is no good.

01:02:56.749 --> 01:02:58.449
The money's gone.

01:02:58.879 --> 01:03:01.269
We have a saying at home:

01:03:04.119 --> 01:03:06.889
"Weeds are not killed
by the frost."

01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:10.760
We still live.

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:14.969
- Have you ever thought of going back?
- I've thought of nothing else.

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:18.160
My father's too proud
to admit he's beaten.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.170
Proud of this.

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:25.970
And so we are left with
the moor and the mist.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:30.811
- You must be very lonely.
- Yes, I am very lonely.

01:03:30.851 --> 01:03:34.121
When you are poor, no
one wants to know you.

01:03:35.451 --> 01:03:37.841
I want to know you, Cecile.

01:03:41.491 --> 01:03:45.331
Why did you run away from me
yesterday, when we'd hardly met?

01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:49.501
Why did you kiss me, Cecile?

01:03:50.271 --> 01:03:51.692
Why?

01:03:52.402 --> 01:03:54.242
I don't know.

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:59.142
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

01:04:18.603 --> 01:04:21.402
Will you meet me
tonight at the hall?

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:24.103
We can walk back across the moor.

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:27.103
If you want me to.

01:04:33.854 --> 01:04:36.874
Our paths seem to have crossed
this morning, Sir Henry.

01:04:38.824 --> 01:04:42.124
I suppose you've come
to talk about the farm.

01:04:42.154 --> 01:04:46.063
You have cider? Good. Cecile,
fetch another tankard for me.

01:04:46.064 --> 01:04:49.893
Now, quickly about it, girl.
Do sit down, Sir Henry.

01:04:49.894 --> 01:04:51.464
Thank you.

01:04:51.465 --> 01:04:55.434
I was wondering if you and your guests
would care to join us for a meal tonight?

01:04:55.435 --> 01:04:59.504
- Just simple fare, of course.
- Yes, so your daughter's already told me.

01:04:59.505 --> 01:05:02.944
I'd be very pleased to. So will
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:06.905
Good. It will be a change
for us to have visitors.

01:05:09.915 --> 01:05:12.046
To your health, sir.

01:05:18.766 --> 01:05:22.795
But how can you be so certain that someone
took one of the bishop's spiders...

01:05:22.796 --> 01:05:25.265
and deliberately placed
it in Sir Henry's room...

01:05:25.266 --> 01:05:27.775
that it wasn't in his
luggage from South Africa?

01:05:27.776 --> 01:05:31.537
Elementary, my dear Watson. There
are no tarantulas in South Africa.

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:35.676
Whoever placed it there
didn't know that.

01:05:35.677 --> 01:05:37.246
Precisely.

01:05:37.247 --> 01:05:40.416
But he did know when and where
Sir Henry was arriving...

01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:41.956
and where he'd be staying.

01:05:41.957 --> 01:05:44.926
He also knew a great deal
about the Baskerville family.

01:05:44.927 --> 01:05:48.756
A bite from a tarantula is not
necessarily deadly to a healthy man...

01:05:48.757 --> 01:05:51.367
but to a man with a weak heart....

01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:54.097
That points to somebody from
this part of the country.

01:05:54.098 --> 01:05:55.137
Why not?

01:05:55.138 --> 01:05:57.707
There's an fine train service
to and from London...

01:05:57.708 --> 01:06:00.367
and as Sir Charles died
here only a month ago...

01:06:00.368 --> 01:06:03.337
it's less suspicious for Sir
Henry to die in London.

01:06:03.338 --> 01:06:05.877
Sir Charles, I'd almost
forgotten about him.

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:09.447
- It's a good thing I remembered, wasn't it?
- All right.

01:06:09.448 --> 01:06:12.848
But the person who benefited most
from his will was Sir Henry.

01:06:12.849 --> 01:06:15.358
You're not going to suggest
that he killed his uncle?

01:06:15.359 --> 01:06:17.928
£1 million is a great temptation.

01:06:17.929 --> 01:06:21.098
In a case such as this, everyone
is suspect, even Sir Henry.

01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:25.128
Dr. Mortimer was the only one who knew
where Sir Henry would be in London...

01:06:25.129 --> 01:06:26.698
and when he was arriving.

01:06:26.699 --> 01:06:30.709
No. No. The London Times
would have published it.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.309
What about the legend
of the hound of Hell?

01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:35.779
Remember, we've both seen
something of its horror.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.279
Watson! You inspire me!

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.479
Let me see your map, quickly.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.149
Selden swore he heard his cries coming
from the very depths of the Earth.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:47.580
The hound of Hell. Let me see.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:51.721
Really, I must pull myself together.
I should have noticed this long ago.

01:06:57.771 --> 01:07:01.100
Holmes. Barrymore told
me you'd arrived.

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:03.340
And about time, too,
if I may say so...

01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:06.340
considering what happened to
that convict fellow last night.

01:07:06.341 --> 01:07:08.810
A development I deeply
regret, Dr. Mortimer.

01:07:08.811 --> 01:07:10.280
I don't.

01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:13.172
A man like that
deserves all he gets.

01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:16.321
In case you're both
wondering why I'm here...

01:07:16.322 --> 01:07:20.051
I've just come over to start
looking through the family estate.

01:07:20.052 --> 01:07:22.361
I think I'm wasting my
time, if you ask me.

01:07:22.362 --> 01:07:23.931
You know, really, Holmes...

01:07:23.932 --> 01:07:27.131
I find it quite impossible
to get on with Sir Henry.

01:07:27.132 --> 01:07:29.931
I understand you had a
disagreement with him last night.

01:07:29.932 --> 01:07:31.202
Disagreement?

01:07:31.203 --> 01:07:33.372
He was downright rude,
if that's what you mean.

01:07:33.373 --> 01:07:36.842
Hardly an excuse to leave him alone
when you know he's in danger.

01:07:36.843 --> 01:07:39.712
You told me you'd stay with
Sir Henry until I got back.

01:07:39.713 --> 01:07:40.942
What if I did?

01:07:40.943 --> 01:07:44.612
I don't see why I should be insulted
by the man I'm trying to protect.

01:07:44.613 --> 01:07:47.382
After all, I only mentioned
the subject of the legend.

01:07:47.383 --> 01:07:50.383
Now, you are very fond of doing
that, Dr. Mortimer. Why?

01:07:50.384 --> 01:07:53.893
Weren't you the first to discover
the existence of the legend?

01:07:53.894 --> 01:07:55.414
Mr. Holmes...

01:07:55.564 --> 01:07:57.233
when I engaged you...

01:07:57.234 --> 01:08:00.163
I looked to you to protect
Sir Henry's interests.

01:08:00.164 --> 01:08:04.502
I'm beginning to see, for the first time
in my life, I was wrong in my judgment.

01:08:04.503 --> 01:08:07.543
- If you care to relinquish the case...
- I never relinquish!

01:08:07.544 --> 01:08:10.914
- Mr. Holmes...
- Please, don't let us fall out at this stage.

01:08:10.915 --> 01:08:14.275
I need your help, unfortunately.

01:08:15.915 --> 01:08:19.814
You know a lot about the geography and
history of this district, I believe.

01:08:19.814 --> 01:08:22.384
I am considered something
of an authority.

01:08:22.385 --> 01:08:25.254
There's an old tin mine
marked here on the map.

01:08:25.255 --> 01:08:28.624
- Does it still exist?
- I believe so.

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:31.435
What of it? It's been
derelict for years.

01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:33.935
Yes, I rather fear this
map a wee out of date.

01:08:33.935 --> 01:08:36.165
Could you show me the
way to the entrance?

01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:38.196
What on earth for?

01:08:39.736 --> 01:08:41.265
Could you?

01:08:41.746 --> 01:08:43.505
I'm afraid not.

01:08:43.506 --> 01:08:48.145
I haven't been near there for years.
Perhaps Stapleton can help you.

01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:50.015
It lies under his ground.

01:08:50.015 --> 01:08:52.986
If he agreed to show me,
would you come with us?

01:08:52.987 --> 01:08:56.877
I suggest that you stay away
from the mine, Mr. Holmes.

01:08:56.886 --> 01:09:00.826
It hasn't been in use for a long time,
the shaft is in a dangerous condition.

01:09:00.827 --> 01:09:03.827
How do you know, if you
haven't been there for years?

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:06.935
It's obvious, isn't it?

01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:09.906
Any tunneling is dangerous if
it isn't in a state of repair.

01:09:09.907 --> 01:09:12.937
Still, I feel I must take a look
at it. Will you come with me?

01:09:12.938 --> 01:09:16.207
As an archeologist, your
help will be invaluable.

01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:19.716
I suppose, if you're going to make an
issue of it, I shall have to come.

01:09:19.718 --> 01:09:22.587
- Good. Good man.
- What do you want me to do?

01:09:22.587 --> 01:09:24.317
Identify anything I may find.

01:09:24.318 --> 01:09:26.517
Strange things are to
be found on the moor.

01:09:26.518 --> 01:09:28.917
Like this, for instance!

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:37.598
- Where did you find that?
- Interesting, isn't it?

01:09:37.599 --> 01:09:39.738
Could you tell me how old it is?

01:09:39.738 --> 01:09:41.658
I'm not sure.

01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:45.108
- About 1700, I imagine.
- 1740, to be exact.

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:46.738
And the blood, how old is that?

01:09:46.738 --> 01:09:47.877
I couldn't tell.

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:50.800
Then I will tell you. It
is less than 10 hours old.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:55.219
Could you tell me anything
else about the weapon?

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.559
No? Come, come.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.189
With your knowledge of the legend,
I made certain you ought to know.

01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:04.759
It's the dagger Sir Hugo used to
murder the girl in the abbey.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.000
And more recently, it has been
used for some diabolical ceremony.

01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:21.450
All right, Watson, we're
all down quite safely.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:24.880
Good! I'll be waiting for you here!

01:10:24.881 --> 01:10:27.620
I don't expect we
shall be very long.

01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:31.012
You'd both better follow close
behind me for the moment.

01:10:56.813 --> 01:10:59.922
You'll have to watch your step.
It's very slippery down here.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:02.883
The water seeps through
from the mire.

01:11:05.323 --> 01:11:07.762
Don't touch any of the
props, whatever you do!

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:10.292
We'll have the whole
roof down on us.

01:11:10.293 --> 01:11:13.333
We should never have come down
here. It's far too dangerous.

01:11:13.334 --> 01:11:16.324
What do you expect
to find, Mr. Holmes?

01:11:16.374 --> 01:11:19.273
What is one likely to
find under the ground?

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:21.264
Bones, perhaps.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:46.934
This is dangerous.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:50.776
You carry on, Mr. Holmes,
while we chock the wheels.

01:11:50.846 --> 01:11:53.645
- Certainly.
- Here you are.

01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:55.336
Thank you.

01:12:21.277 --> 01:12:25.767
We won't need to go any further.
I've found what I came down for.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.600
No good, Watson?

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.601
Leave the lanterns
there, Mr. Stapleton.

01:13:37.721 --> 01:13:40.220
We must go to the village
and get some help.

01:13:40.221 --> 01:13:42.260
I'm afraid it won't
do no good, sir.

01:13:42.261 --> 01:13:44.860
Must be a ton of rock
blocking that shaft there.

01:13:44.861 --> 01:13:46.790
We must try.

01:13:46.791 --> 01:13:51.031
You must resign yourself to the fact
that there's no hope of him being alive.

01:13:51.032 --> 01:13:54.962
- Don't you agree, Stapleton?
- You know as much about it as I do.

01:13:55.142 --> 01:13:57.001
It's over two hours
since the roof fell.

01:13:57.002 --> 01:13:59.071
You've been down there.
We've heard nothing.

01:13:59.072 --> 01:14:01.381
Not likely to, with all
that rock in front of us.

01:14:01.382 --> 01:14:03.311
That don't mean to
say he's not alive.

01:14:03.312 --> 01:14:07.551
Plenty of air in that old mine. Comes
in from them ventilating shafts.

01:14:07.552 --> 01:14:10.181
Couldn't we get down one of
them and find him that way?

01:14:10.182 --> 01:14:11.492
I wouldn't like to say, sir.

01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:13.952
I doubt there's a man as
knows them entrances.

01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:15.392
We must try to find one.

01:14:15.393 --> 01:14:19.283
Mr. Stapleton, will you lead us back
to the path immediately, please?

01:14:27.033 --> 01:14:29.133
I did warn him not to go.

01:14:29.143 --> 01:14:31.173
You were there. You
heard me, didn't you?

01:14:31.174 --> 01:14:33.774
- There's still a chance.
- A very good chance.

01:14:33.874 --> 01:14:36.343
I've been waiting for you
for the last 10 minutes.

01:14:36.344 --> 01:14:38.344
Holmes!

01:14:39.014 --> 01:14:43.983
- Thank heaven you're safe.
- How did you get out? This is wonderful.

01:14:43.984 --> 01:14:45.453
That's gratifying.

01:14:45.454 --> 01:14:49.363
When the applause has died down,
I wonder if we could get back to the hall.

01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:53.395
I've hurt my leg, I'm
cold, and I'm hungry.

01:14:54.265 --> 01:14:56.604
Will you please stop
behaving like a maiden aunt.

01:14:56.605 --> 01:14:59.934
If I hadn't known there were a
number of entrances to the mine...

01:14:59.935 --> 01:15:03.174
- ...I'd never have gone down.
- But for a wretched old beef bone...

01:15:03.175 --> 01:15:06.414
It is not a wretched old beef bone.
That's just the point.

01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:07.684
It's a relatively new one.

01:15:07.685 --> 01:15:09.114
- But I...
- No buts.

01:15:09.115 --> 01:15:11.615
Would you mind, please,
passing me my tobacco?

01:15:11.616 --> 01:15:15.585
- Where is it?
- You'll find it in the top right-hand drawer.

01:15:15.586 --> 01:15:17.546
An unopened tin.

01:15:20.056 --> 01:15:23.795
- You must have put it somewhere else.
- The right-hand top drawer.

01:15:23.796 --> 01:15:27.495
- I'm looking in the right-hand top drawer.
- Isn't it there?

01:15:27.496 --> 01:15:30.135
I've just told you it isn't there.

01:15:30.136 --> 01:15:31.436
Here it is.

01:15:31.437 --> 01:15:34.306
Just a minute. I know I put
it there this morning.

01:15:34.307 --> 01:15:36.906
Watson, the bottom drawer,
where I put the dagger...

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.007
is it still locked?

01:15:39.647 --> 01:15:41.016
No.

01:15:41.017 --> 01:15:43.607
Holmes, the lock's been forced!

01:15:43.947 --> 01:15:46.047
The dagger's not there.

01:15:48.357 --> 01:15:50.017
Watson.

01:15:50.658 --> 01:15:52.757
How's the leg feeling now?

01:15:52.758 --> 01:15:55.967
- Not very good.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.697
I wasn't able to tell you before...

01:15:57.698 --> 01:16:00.397
but Stapleton has asked us
over for a meal tonight.

01:16:00.398 --> 01:16:04.267
- Has he?
- Yes. I thought it was a very nice gesture.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:07.947
Still, I don't suppose you'll feel like
going with your leg the way it is.

01:16:07.948 --> 01:16:09.247
No, I don't.

01:16:09.248 --> 01:16:14.239
They'll be very disappointed, and
Cecile is waiting for me downstairs.

01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:18.149
Of course, I wouldn't dream
of going without you.

01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:21.358
My dear Sir Henry, if you'd
wanted us to come with you...

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:24.598
you'd have told us about the
invitation much sooner than this.

01:16:24.599 --> 01:16:25.658
I beg your pardon?

01:16:25.659 --> 01:16:29.098
You'd better be off. You mustn't
be late for your peasant friends.

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:32.899
- I don't like that, Holmes.
- I don't like the people you're mixing with.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.669
I thought, in your new position, you
would've cultivated worthier friends.

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:39.440
I hope you enjoy their rabbit pie.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.450
Mr. Holmes, I appreciate the fact
that you are here to help me.

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:51.651
Nevertheless, I would remind you that
you are also a guest in my house.

01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:55.891
- Good night!
- Good night.

01:17:01.571 --> 01:17:04.300
- I do think you might...
- Do stop talking nonsense.

01:17:04.301 --> 01:17:05.400
You know my methods.

01:17:05.401 --> 01:17:07.470
Couldn't you see I was
being purposely rude?

01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:10.240
I wanted him to go without us.
The dagger's gone.

01:17:10.241 --> 01:17:13.732
Don't you realize what that means?
Sir Henry is to die tonight!

01:17:34.203 --> 01:17:36.032
Are you sure your leg is all right?

01:17:36.033 --> 01:17:39.572
It's got to be, if we're to break the
curse he laid on the Baskervilles.

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:41.042
- Holmes?
- Yes.

01:17:41.043 --> 01:17:44.042
You learned something from that
portrait that I never saw.

01:17:44.043 --> 01:17:47.442
The hands, Watson. Why do you
think this painting was stolen?

01:17:47.443 --> 01:17:51.953
Because the artist revealed both hands.
Barrymore's confirmed what I suspected.

01:17:51.954 --> 01:17:54.993
The fingers of Sir Hugo's
right hand were webbed.

01:17:54.994 --> 01:17:57.723
- Stapleton.
- Exactly. Stapleton.

01:17:57.724 --> 01:18:02.114
Illegitimate descendent of Sir Hugo,
next in line to the Baskerville fortune.

01:18:42.706 --> 01:18:45.045
- No. This way.
- But this is the way to the farm.

01:18:45.046 --> 01:18:46.636
Come on.

01:20:33.152 --> 01:20:34.682
Swine!

01:20:34.692 --> 01:20:38.352
You thought it was going to be
easy, didn't you? Didn't you?

01:20:38.662 --> 01:20:41.822
You won't be the first of your
family who thought that...

01:20:41.932 --> 01:20:44.892
and you won't be the first
to die because of it.

01:20:45.102 --> 01:20:46.732
Remember the legend?

01:20:47.532 --> 01:20:49.632
Sir Hugo died here.

01:20:50.002 --> 01:20:53.642
His throat was torn out
because of a girl.

01:20:53.643 --> 01:20:57.573
And Sir Charles, your dear
uncle, he died here, didn't he?

01:20:58.153 --> 01:21:01.013
Died because he
wanted me, like you.

01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:05.613
Died because he wanted a woman enough
to bring me here alone at night...

01:21:06.323 --> 01:21:09.483
in spite of the hound
of the Baskervilles.

01:21:09.523 --> 01:21:11.754
He died screaming.

01:21:12.094 --> 01:21:15.334
I know. I watched him.

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:18.534
And now you are here alone...

01:21:18.774 --> 01:21:20.103
at night.

01:21:20.104 --> 01:21:22.594
You don't understand, do you?

01:21:22.604 --> 01:21:23.973
Then let me explain.

01:21:23.974 --> 01:21:27.313
I, too, am a Baskerville,
descended from Sir Hugo...

01:21:27.314 --> 01:21:32.205
descended from those who died in
poverty while you scum ruled the moor.

01:21:32.885 --> 01:21:36.985
We have waited and prayed for
this moment, my father and I.

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:40.985
Now our time has come, and yours.

01:21:41.055 --> 01:21:43.955
The curse of the hound is on you.

01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:06.009
No, Watson! She won't get far.
Attend to Sir Henry.

01:23:09.849 --> 01:23:11.489
All right.

01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:12.989
All right, Sir Henry.

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:16.059
The hound is dead, and
you must see it, sir.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.290
No, I don't....

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.150
It is best that you should.

01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:32.301
There is nothing to fear now.

01:23:40.021 --> 01:23:42.650
There's a passage leading
from the mine to this place.

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:46.451
I discovered it after Stapleton
tried to kill me down there.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:54.761
They used this mask to make
it look more terrifying.

01:23:54.762 --> 01:23:58.241
He was starved for weeks, kept in
the mine till the time was ripe...

01:23:58.242 --> 01:24:00.402
then given the scent.

01:24:09.612 --> 01:24:13.313
They had to have something
of yours to give the hound.

01:24:14.153 --> 01:24:16.792
We'd better get Sir Henry
back to Baskerville Hall.

01:24:16.793 --> 01:24:20.823
Have you got your cape?
Would you get it for me?

01:24:41.384 --> 01:24:45.283
- So the curse has claimed its last victim.
- Yes.

01:24:45.284 --> 01:24:48.454
No more will be heard of the
hound of the Baskervilles.

01:24:53.395 --> 01:24:57.034
I feel I have already suffered
enough from my infamous ancestor...

01:24:57.035 --> 01:24:58.234
and so....

01:24:58.235 --> 01:25:00.434
"And so I am sending you
the missing portrait...

01:25:00.435 --> 01:25:04.704
"which we found at Stapleton's farm to
add to your collection of souvenirs.

01:25:04.705 --> 01:25:08.774
"I hope you will accept it, also
the check which I enclose for..."

01:25:08.775 --> 01:25:10.915
Very generous.

01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:14.245
After tea, you must write to Sir
Henry that I should be pleased...

01:25:14.246 --> 01:25:16.586
to accept both his gifts.

01:25:18.926 --> 01:25:20.725
Tell me, Holmes...

01:25:20.726 --> 01:25:24.055
when did you first suspect
the truth about this case?

01:25:24.056 --> 01:25:29.035
- The truth?
- Yes, that the hound was a real dog...

01:25:29.036 --> 01:25:31.267
and not just a legendary myth.

01:25:31.437 --> 01:25:33.606
When Sir Henry complained
of a missing boot...

01:25:33.607 --> 01:25:36.127
that put me on the
scent, as it were.

01:25:36.277 --> 01:25:38.437
As early as that.

01:25:38.777 --> 01:25:40.406
That's incredible.

01:25:40.407 --> 01:25:43.037
It's elementary, my dear Watson.

01:25:44.017 --> 01:25:45.647
A muffin?

01:25:46.147 --> 01:25:48.017
Thank you.
