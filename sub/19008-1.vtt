01:08.969 --> 01:10.334
Mind yourself.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.643
Oh, my God, Tara.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.872
Your water's broke.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.079
Her water.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.079
Tara!

03:12.593 --> 03:15.756
Marry me! I'm your man!

03:15.796 --> 03:18.231
Thirty flooded acres!

03:18.265 --> 03:20.597
Go away and leave us alone.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.501
- I'm talking to Tara.
-Go away, Mick.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.130
Who else'll have you now?

03:26.340 --> 03:30.368
- Huh?
-Home, now. Sleep it off.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.611
How are they?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.643
Fine, thank you, Sergeant.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.752
It's Mick and the sergeant
at it again.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.728
They're like tomcats.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.197
They'll only
come near me at night.

03:56.203 --> 03:59.468
At least we've a man
on our side from now on.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.427
Aren't you the lucky lad, Jimmy?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.835
This dump is going
to be all yours one day...

04:29.870 --> 04:31.031
if you're not careful.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.470
Oh, Tara.

04:37.478 --> 04:41.005
I couldn't bear to touch it,
the poor wee thing.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.055
Mrs. Ryan.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.722
I'm only here
because I feel sorry for you.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.857
You can spare your sorrow
for yourself.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.889
What can we do for you?

04:59.933 --> 05:03.198
A button. A fairly big one
that's fairly small...

05:03.237 --> 05:05.433
with four holes,
as opposed to two.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.998
I'm making my niece a dress.
She's emigrating.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.170
Lucky bitch.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.072
What about this?

05:13.113 --> 05:14.547
It's the latest fashion,
you know.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.208
She's my niece, not a trollop.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.814
- Would this do?
-Sixpence.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.429
God love us.
Poor wee bastard.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.761
Shut your gob.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.893
Who's the father?

05:33.934 --> 05:37.700
There'll be no luck about
this place until you own up.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.100
If everyone around here
owned up to their sins...

05:41.141 --> 05:43.508
there'd be a queue at
the confession box a mile long.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.284
Come on! Pull!

06:13.340 --> 06:15.672
Holy God. Why me?

06:17.277 --> 06:21.646
Since you gave up the drink,
has it been any easier?

06:21.682 --> 06:25.550
Worse. Far worse.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.419
Drink's an anesthetic.

06:28.455 --> 06:32.722
It takes away the feelings
for a while, the pain.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.989
And the joy.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.655
I can't remember.

06:36.697 --> 06:40.827
God sees your suffering
and understands.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.632
Then why can't she?

06:42.669 --> 06:45.730
You're not the only man
who wants to marry her.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.572
Is it Mick you're talking about?

06:48.609 --> 06:51.738
If he so much as
lays a finger on her...

06:51.779 --> 06:53.304
I'll strangle him with me--

06:53.347 --> 06:55.782
Don't commit murder
in your heart, man.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.477
May God forgive me, Father...

06:57.518 --> 06:59.919
but that's the way I feel
sometimes.

07:49.403 --> 07:52.236
Mick has blown his brains out!
Come on!

08:09.022 --> 08:11.753
The rain drove him crazy.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.592
- Why?
-'Cause his cows was dying.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.427
He had no wife, that's why.

08:17.464 --> 08:21.492
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.767
Give us a hand, you two.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.246
You should've seized the gun off
of him, Sergeant.

08:43.289 --> 08:46.157
The state he was in.
Revoked his license!

08:46.193 --> 08:47.786
Leave me be.

08:59.506 --> 09:03.238
Scandal is a contagion.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.144
And one sinner...

09:06.179 --> 09:10.548
can infect an entire community.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.780
Tara Maguire...

09:12.819 --> 09:15.948
name the man who wronged you...

09:15.989 --> 09:18.014
or the whoremaster
will bring down...

09:18.058 --> 09:22.154
yet more corruption and disaster
on the heads of us all!

09:24.498 --> 09:26.159
Tara?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.463
Tara!

09:28.502 --> 09:30.903
Tara, my dear child...

09:30.938 --> 09:34.602
trust in your neighbors
and your friends...

09:34.641 --> 09:36.166
and in the Lord!

09:40.948 --> 09:42.347
She's not a leper.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.821
You're flying
in the face of the parish...

09:48.855 --> 09:50.345
and Mick's suicide
was the last straw.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.950
That's one mortal sin
they can't nail on me.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.360
I wish to God
I was in Dublin or London.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.124
With a baby
tucked under your arms?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.531
You wouldn't last five minutes.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.371
- Leave it there.
-Don't be stupid.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.958
Own up.
Whose baby is it?

10:30.998 --> 10:33.228
Ask your husbands.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.866
He's my baby! Mine!

11:09.369 --> 11:10.928
Look!

11:13.073 --> 11:14.871
"Murder in the Red Barn."

11:14.908 --> 11:17.377
- Will there be guns in it?
-Is it a cowboy?

11:17.411 --> 11:19.243
There's guns in it, all right...

11:19.279 --> 11:20.838
and an axe...

11:20.881 --> 11:23.873
and a boy and a cow.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.114
I wonder what "The Nun's Story"
will be about.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.815
It's about a nun.

11:31.425 --> 11:34.053
What do you get
if you win the raffle?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.323
The first prize...

11:35.362 --> 11:37.228
is a pound of butter
and a packet of tea.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.562
We have a double bed.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.192
Could sleep three easy.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.759
Is that right?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.396
“The Crappy Boy.“

11:44.438 --> 11:47.203
“The Crappy Buy.“
Come here to me, you.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.699
Did you not wash behind
your ears this morning, lad?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.743
How much is six pence?

11:53.780 --> 11:57.148
For you, three pence.
Only for you, though.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.517
What is that?

12:54.207 --> 12:57.643
I bet those flowers
are for Tara.

13:18.732 --> 13:21.394
Morning, Father.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.266
Morning, Father.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.705
Just like all the other men
in this place.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.708
Scared to death of the priest.

13:28.742 --> 13:32.303
Scared to death of you,
more like.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.946
I could have gone...

13:36.983 --> 13:38.576
to the ecclesiastical
outfitters in Dublin, Tara...

13:38.618 --> 13:41.315
but I'd rather
you had the money.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.652
If you're not too proud
to take it, that is.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.182
What's your inside leg, Father?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.888
I don't understand
your question.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.055
Here, hold this.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.525
Up higher. That's it.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.504
You still angry at me?

14:00.540 --> 14:04.033
You read me from the pulpit,
and I'll never forgive you...

14:04.077 --> 14:05.567
but I need your money.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.178
He looks like a tough
wee customer right enough.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.549
I'll have it within the week.
Do you want the same--

14:12.586 --> 14:15.317
Exactly the same, if you please.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.619
Change is a dangerous thing.

14:17.657 --> 14:21.252
Change of fashion,
change of heart, of mind...

14:21.294 --> 14:23.160
change of religion...

14:23.196 --> 14:26.598
it's all a sign
of these shallow times.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.027
Mick's death
could've been avoided, Tara.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.597
He killed himself
over bad money...

14:33.640 --> 14:36.041
and rotten land,
not for my sake.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.874
But the sergeant,
now, there's a man...

14:37.911 --> 14:39.777
who could be relied on
by anyone.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.144
Indeed.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.173
He's just the person to set you
on the straight and narrow.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.686
What do you say?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.485
I'll be needing half the cash
in advance, by the way.

14:49.522 --> 14:54.050
Tara, don't drive another soul
to drink and despair.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.570
What the hell are you doing?

15:10.610 --> 15:13.511
Woodwork, sir. It's me hobby.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.605
I wish I had the time
for woodwork.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.584
If ever you do, sir,
I'll lend you me tools.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.679
Let me smell your breath.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.523
Get out on patrol-now.

15:30.563 --> 15:34.500
You're supposed to be
a policeman, not a carpenter.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.099
Tara...

16:48.141 --> 16:50.439
up to your old tricks again?

16:50.477 --> 16:52.775
What do you think?

16:52.812 --> 16:56.214
Once a smuggler,
always a smuggler.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.944
It's food, that's all.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.885
And a suit for Father Malone.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.857
It's time he changed out of
sackcloth and ashes anyway.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.325
Would you look at the two of us?

17:16.368 --> 17:19.896
The lawbreaker and the lawmaker.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.607
I'm earning a bit extra
for me and the baby.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.277
You trying to make life
more difficult for us?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.147
There's nothing I want less.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.811
Let me go, then.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.651
What's happened to your hand?

17:41.694 --> 17:46.427
Just a little nick,
cleaning me bicycle.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.504
Marry me, or I'll go mad.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.607
I'd go mad if I did.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.079
Let me look after
the two of you.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.819
We don't need looking after.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.223
You will.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.262
Splendid. Splendid!

19:29.602 --> 19:33.232
Do you know, I can smell money.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.869
Vonnie, dream's over.
Back to reality.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.121
How are youse?
Youse are welcome.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.214
Youse are welcome here, too!

19:51.257 --> 19:54.227
Thank you, Seamus.
Thank you, Gerry.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.389
- I've got a piano.
-So have I.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.860
You can give them
all the Shakespeare you want.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.869
They won't know the difference.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.997
- You coming to the show?
-Yeah.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.803
Yeah, of course.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.143
In front of the children.
Vonnie.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.049
Looks like
the last place God made.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.415
Isn't that what you said about
the place we were last week?

20:24.457 --> 20:27.916
- I was wrong.
-Will you shut up, Vonnie?

20:27.961 --> 20:29.759
You're always grousing.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.332
Let's get this show
off the road.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.579
I got first tabs on her.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.138
You can have the sister.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.217
With a bit of luck, man...

20:52.252 --> 20:53.947
we'll have a great time, huh?

21:06.266 --> 21:10.965
If these chancers on the green
cause you any trouble...

21:11.004 --> 21:12.494
you've only to say the word.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.905
They're only trying
to scrape a living...

21:14.941 --> 21:16.875
same as the rest of us.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.671
Ah, Sergeant.
Complimentary tickets...

21:20.713 --> 21:22.613
for yourself...
and your family?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.118
I'll be there every night...

21:25.151 --> 21:27.381
on duty.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.747
What do you think you're doing?

21:56.783 --> 21:59.150
Hello. I'm Tom Casey.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.119
I'm from
the Department of Agriculture.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.350
We're investigating
these chickens...

22:03.389 --> 22:04.754
for the old epidemic...

22:04.791 --> 22:07.158
and I can see you don't believe
a word I'm saying.

22:07.193 --> 22:10.561
I was stealing
one of your chickens.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.859
Right.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.534
I'd better call
Sergeant Hegalty, then.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.936
No, no. Wait a minute.
I'll pay you for it.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.598
Ten bob.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.702
What? You must be joking.
It's not worth two bob.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.236
Sergeant! Sergeant!

22:27.280 --> 22:30.875
Wait a minute.
Will you hold your horses here?

22:30.917 --> 22:34.444
Wait till I see
what I have for you here. Now...

22:34.487 --> 22:37.286
- Five bob do it?
-No.

22:37.323 --> 22:40.588
For now.
I'll owe you the rest.

22:43.062 --> 22:46.589
I'll give it to you
after the show tonight.

22:49.802 --> 22:53.102
I want the five bob you owe me
before the show.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.702
You must think
I'm a terrible idiot.

22:59.746 --> 23:03.114
Oh, no, no, no.
I can see you're not.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.480
Good.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.657
Hope you taste better
than you look.

23:20.133 --> 23:23.068
You bloody chancer.
We don't want more trouble.

23:23.102 --> 23:26.663
He flew right under me jacket,
I'm telling you.

23:29.942 --> 23:33.401
Behave yourself this year,
or I'll tell John-Joe.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.777
You can talk.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.647
At least it'll bring
a bit of custom into the shop.

23:37.683 --> 23:40.380
We made five bob already.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.756
Would you?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.321
I would.

24:00.406 --> 24:04.570
My mother, she said
put your shirts back on.

24:04.610 --> 24:08.376
It's not decent half-naked.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.883
Tell her to come over here
herself, will you?

24:18.558 --> 24:21.459
One, two, three.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.485
Up. There she goes.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.613
What's the new sergeant
like here?

24:44.650 --> 24:47.984
He's nice.
He's after Tara Maguire.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.581
Is he, by Christ?
Who's after the sister?

24:51.624 --> 24:52.989
Blacksmith.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.221
So you're out of luck there
as well.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.105
It's a woman driving.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.379
I hate hanging around
on these jobs.

25:50.516 --> 25:53.144
The place is crawling
with customs men.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.778
Relax, Richie.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.812
If they put you in jail,
I'll bake you a cake.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.633
Do you know what this is?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.433
Sure. Wireless with pictures.

26:11.470 --> 26:14.235
Is this more cloth
for His Holiness?

26:14.273 --> 26:15.570
'Tis.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.542
Let's hope he gets
another year in Purgatory...

26:17.577 --> 26:19.773
for saying Mass
in smuggled clothes.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.417
Come on, Tara.
Just for old times' sake.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.558
One extra.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.428
For a man named Cassidy.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.523
He'll be passing your way.

26:40.566 --> 26:43.126
What is it?
Second-hand false teeth?

26:43.169 --> 26:44.568
Razor blades.

26:48.341 --> 26:49.866
I hear you're marrying
the sergeant.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.708
Good move, Tara.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.645
Where'd you hear that?

26:54.680 --> 26:57.149
Father Malone.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.277
He told
the wife's sister's auntie.

26:59.318 --> 27:03.277
If you believe all you hear,
you'll eat all you see.

27:08.728 --> 27:12.756
Smuggling with a baby.
That's a new one.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.859
Best to start 'em young,
like gamecocks.

27:33.586 --> 27:35.054
You coming to the show tonight?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.680
Didn't we see it last year?

27:36.722 --> 27:38.383
Might be even better this year.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.893
That wouldn't be hard.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.494
Jesus.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.833
That's not another one of mine,
is it?

27:51.871 --> 27:54.101
Sure. Hasn't he tattoos
all over his bum?

27:59.178 --> 28:00.873
Your razor blades.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.974
Thanks.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.883
They're cheaper in the north.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.650
I use them in an act.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.558
Razor blades, my foot.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.400
We'll definitely
have to go now...

28:22.435 --> 28:24.665
see the old armchair
up on the stage.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.468
Why are you always
following me around?

28:26.505 --> 28:28.064
Because you're
as slippery as an eel.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.166
And remember, I know what
happened to you in Dublin.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.904
Nobody knows
what happened in Dublin...

28:31.944 --> 28:33.878
so shut your gob.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.549
Hope he doesn't
electrocute himself.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.926
Look at him now.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.917
Good man, eh? Good man.

29:11.951 --> 29:15.615
It's not the first time
he's stole electric.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.531
I'd be lost without you, Tom.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.163
Ba njaxed.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.003
You're banjaxed with me,
Freddie.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.474
So what's the difference?

29:36.509 --> 29:39.069
'Tis I, Hamlet the Dane!

29:40.346 --> 29:41.836
Romeo!

29:41.881 --> 29:45.476
Romeo!
Wherefore alt thou, Romeo?

29:45.518 --> 29:48.180
Is this a padre
that I see before me?

29:48.220 --> 29:50.780
How are you, Freddie?
Good to see you.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.552
How long are you here for
this time?

29:52.591 --> 29:54.116
Well, a week or two...

29:54.160 --> 29:55.594
depending on the box office.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.290
Grand. I'll announce it
from the pulpit.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.695
You'll pack out, Freddie.

29:59.732 --> 30:01.496
We'll make the usual donation.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.002
Grand.

30:03.035 --> 30:06.630
One thing, mind. Legs.

30:06.672 --> 30:09.334
No unseemly display of flesh.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.843
Is that clear?

30:12.578 --> 30:14.239
Of course, Father.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.475
Grand.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.619
Are we late?

30:28.661 --> 30:31.255
Not at all.
They can't start without us.

30:31.297 --> 30:34.528
Next, please. Sixpence.
Thank you.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.727
Come on, boys.

30:46.045 --> 30:52.917
Down by the Sally Gardens

30:52.952 --> 30:59.119
My love and I did meet

31:06.599 --> 31:10.263
Sir, we never had anything
to do with insurrection.

31:10.302 --> 31:13.294
We're a law-abiding family, sir,
and always have been.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.068
Well, now, honest to God, sir.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.940
I cannot believe a word
coming out of her lying lips.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.809
No. Now, you can, sir.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.472
I told me son...

31:21.513 --> 31:24.141
that if he ever wanted
to fight for his country...

31:24.183 --> 31:26.811
there was no use in him coming
to me for the old gun.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.320
I have it well hidden, sir.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.846
In the thatch.
Out of harm's way.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.718
Can you speak
somewhat slower, man?

31:37.930 --> 31:40.729
I can hardly understand
a word the damn fool says.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.097
Will you shut up, you idiot?

31:42.134 --> 31:45.035
Don't worry, sir.
if I hear anything...

31:45.070 --> 31:47.801
coming out about
the rising of the moon...

31:47.840 --> 31:50.434
'twill be the first thing I do
is let you know...

31:50.476 --> 31:51.807
and that's God's truth, sir!

31:51.844 --> 31:54.370
I have to agree with that.
That's God's truth, sir.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.781
Only one son of mine
ever bore arms...

31:57.816 --> 31:59.477
and that was me first born,
you know, Douglas.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.182
He was shot a while back,
the yeoman of Wexler.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.658
Easy, easy!

32:06.692 --> 32:08.126
What's the damn fool saying?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.185
He's a bit soft
in the head, sir...

32:10.229 --> 32:11.822
since the mule kicked him.

32:11.864 --> 32:13.423
That's why he rambles on.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.866
I think we can proceed, sir.

32:15.901 --> 32:17.869
I have searched
the premises thoroughly.

32:17.903 --> 32:19.234
The only thing to be caught...

32:19.271 --> 32:21.603
in this godforsaken hole
is the cold.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.268
You'd catch more than that
if you knew where to look.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.639
- What did he say?
-No idea, sir.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.745
You're next.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.445
Our hearts are broke
with the murder...

32:33.485 --> 32:35.385
mayhem, and general debauch.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.118
Rebellion
is a hanging offense, madame!

32:38.157 --> 32:42.185
Nonetheless, I compliment you
on your choice of armchair.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.161
Fit for the king himself.

32:44.196 --> 32:47.826
Captain Williams,
let us proceed--

32:47.866 --> 32:49.595
Where is the damn boy?

32:49.635 --> 32:53.162
I saw him going out
that way, sir.

32:53.205 --> 32:56.300
Maybe to join
his regiment of friends.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.208
God bless him.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.307
Watching without paying.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.839
I caught you.

33:03.882 --> 33:06.374
We're even, so.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.443
You wouldn't have the loan
of a few pounds, would you?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.080
I'll give it back to you
before Christmas.

33:10.122 --> 33:13.057
Are you Tara or Brigid?

33:13.092 --> 33:15.288
Tara.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.227
The one with the baby?

33:17.262 --> 33:21.028
Aw, Christ.
Of all the luck.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.700
I've sworn to capture
every Croppy Boy...

33:28.741 --> 33:30.470
that dares show his face...

33:30.509 --> 33:32.978
and the rest
I'll hunt down like foxes!

33:33.012 --> 33:34.480
And furthermore...

33:34.513 --> 33:36.743
there will be scaffolds
on every hill...

33:36.782 --> 33:38.648
from here to Sligo!

33:40.119 --> 33:42.019
The battalion has returned.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.526
It's raining buckets, Captain.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.641
Tara.

34:09.181 --> 34:13.175
Tara, it's me, Brendan.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.324
Can I touch?

34:23.362 --> 34:24.795
For a quid.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.068
Come back tomorrow night.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.369
The show's always different.

34:42.947 --> 34:44.973
That tire's as bald as an egg.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.543
Shouldn't be on the road.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.610
Dear, oh, dear.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.454
I just simply hadn't noticed.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.186
Oh, Tom.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.419
Did you enjoy the show, Sarge?

34:57.463 --> 35:00.433
Do you have the insurance
documents for these vehicles?

35:00.466 --> 35:03.094
We do, of course.
We have the death certificate...

35:03.135 --> 35:06.833
birth certificate,
dog license. The lot.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.840
Right away, showman.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.844
Actor, if you don't mind.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.470
This isn't a circus.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.946
As near as, damn it.

35:14.980 --> 35:17.642
Oh, now,
my dear sergeant...

35:17.683 --> 35:19.651
let's be Christian about this.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.950
Bear with me while I take off
my tatters and greasepaints...

35:22.988 --> 35:24.717
and we'll have
a drink together...

35:24.756 --> 35:26.281
to celebrate a successful
first night.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.760
I'm not a drinking man.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.991
Oh? You surprise me.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.829
I want those documents now.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.063
I'll post them to you
first thing in the morning.

35:37.102 --> 35:40.333
You'll have them
by the end of the month.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.170
I'm only joking, Sergeant.

36:04.096 --> 36:07.555
Tara, it's Sergeant Hegalty.
He wants to talk.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.966
You're looking grand, Tara.
Lovely.

36:19.011 --> 36:21.070
What's that
you brought with you?

36:22.548 --> 36:26.075
It's a...it's a crib.

36:27.886 --> 36:32.221
I made it for you and the baby.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.360
I can't take it.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.303
I only want him to sleep
in my crib, that's all.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.306
No.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.401
Please, try to understand.

36:51.443 --> 36:55.073
I can't put him in there.

36:55.113 --> 36:56.603
Why?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.382
Look at it, won't you?

37:00.419 --> 37:02.410
It's beautiful.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.621
You know why.

37:08.126 --> 37:09.821
I don't like
what you're trying to do.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.757
It won't eat him.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.934
It's wood.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.637
That's all it is.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.771
Please!

37:27.980 --> 37:29.243
Wood.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.511
Leave us alone.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.109
Nqw!

37:41.293 --> 37:42.692
It's only wood.

37:49.334 --> 37:50.824
I can wait.

37:52.504 --> 37:56.407
At least it can keep him
warm for an hour.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.965
Seven...

38:34.946 --> 38:36.880
Cassidy.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.405
Dear boy.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.382
Thank you so much.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.913
Now my little princess.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.890
Bravo.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.222
Thomas?

38:49.461 --> 38:51.862
Well-earned, well-earned.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.265
Here we are.
Thank you so much indeed.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.565
Thank you for
a lovely performance last night.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.368
There we are. That's it.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.168
- And what about Timmy?
-it's my job.

39:06.211 --> 39:09.203
That last pile...it's my son's.

39:09.247 --> 39:12.649
He doesn't qualify yet
for a share.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.052
I was ten years on the road
before I got a penny.

39:16.088 --> 39:18.250
And you did it all
on a one-wheeled bicycle.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.917
Will you play fair, Freddie?

39:19.958 --> 39:21.426
Play fair?

39:21.460 --> 39:24.691
This time last year,
you were in the gutter, lad.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.960
This time this year,
we're all in the gutter.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.729
Where's the gold you owe us
from the Fair of Muff?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.429
It's like getting blood
out of a turnip!

39:31.470 --> 39:33.564
But just think!

39:33.605 --> 39:35.835
I mean,
the price of petrol...

39:35.874 --> 39:38.343
running repairs
on the tent, income tax.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.538
Income tax?

39:39.578 --> 39:41.239
That's the best one yet!

39:41.279 --> 39:43.509
You do all right, Rachel.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.607
No one asks you
to share your perks.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.913
How dare you?

39:46.952 --> 39:50.786
Unhand me, or I'll evict you
from your parts!

39:50.822 --> 39:53.154
Holy God,
every week the same.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.023
We're all
in the same leaky boat.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.893
I'm warning you, Freddie,
I'm ready to jump overboard.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.425
In all of my years...never!

40:02.467 --> 40:04.231
Ingrates!

40:04.269 --> 40:07.330
I could've gone to England,
made a fortune...

40:07.372 --> 40:10.398
but I stayed here
to preserve the genius...

40:10.442 --> 40:12.570
of our Irish theater!

40:12.611 --> 40:15.603
I promise to make stars of you!

40:15.647 --> 40:18.116
We're not
peasants in the fields!

40:18.150 --> 40:21.017
Dead souls in factories!

40:21.052 --> 40:23.487
We are actors!

40:47.512 --> 40:49.537
Tom...

40:49.581 --> 40:51.913
I realized years ago...

40:51.950 --> 40:55.409
there's no crock of gold
in this life.

40:55.454 --> 40:59.550
There's just two magic hours
up here, every night.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.491
Ah, Freddie.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.494
We're only dreaming.

41:03.528 --> 41:06.896
Give up that dream, Tom,
and you're finished.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.299
Maybe we're finished anyway.

41:09.334 --> 41:12.395
Tom, when I retire...

41:15.073 --> 41:18.304
all this can be yours.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.680
I'd better go get
a needle and thread, then.

41:47.439 --> 41:48.668
Hello?

41:48.707 --> 41:50.197
Hi.

41:50.242 --> 41:51.539
How do you do?

41:54.479 --> 41:57.813
Listen, I'm truly sorry
I put me foot in it yesterday.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.284
I had no notion
you were married.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.377
Since when?

42:05.156 --> 42:06.920
I didn't want an old husband.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.619
I just wanted a baby.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.425
Liar. You didn't even
want a baby...

42:11.463 --> 42:14.091
till the baby started
wanting you.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.226
He's no fool, that baby.

42:17.969 --> 42:21.599
Look, I'm only here for a week.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.734
What are you doing
for the rest of the day?

42:23.775 --> 42:26.369
Cheek!

42:26.411 --> 42:28.937
Clear off, you buck idiot!

42:28.980 --> 42:32.348
Hey! This is me Sunday shirt!

42:32.384 --> 42:33.818
Give us a break, will you?

42:33.852 --> 42:35.411
I'll break your head,
that's what.

42:40.492 --> 42:42.358
Are you mad? Get out of here!

42:42.394 --> 42:43.589
Get out!

42:47.198 --> 42:49.030
You're the idiot.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.365
I'll see you
in the front row tonight.

42:51.403 --> 42:54.338
Let you in for half price,
if you're lucky.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.456
Are you stone mad entirely?

43:15.493 --> 43:16.961
Will you leave me alone?

43:16.995 --> 43:18.394
Never.

43:18.430 --> 43:21.798
I'm staying here all day
and all night...

43:21.833 --> 43:23.198
until you come out
for a walk with me.

43:23.234 --> 43:25.931
Go away and take
a running jump for yourself.

43:32.010 --> 43:34.274
Take a running jump, huh?

43:34.312 --> 43:35.905
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.314
Stop that, or you'll be sorry.

43:38.350 --> 43:39.909
Where's the man
that's going to stop me?

43:39.951 --> 43:41.282
In there with you?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.632
I'm sure
it's not the first time...

43:57.669 --> 44:00.695
you've seen a man
without his trousers, huh?

44:04.643 --> 44:06.168
How are they from behind?

44:09.781 --> 44:11.306
Try the jacket.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.155
Yeah, that's grand.

44:18.189 --> 44:19.486
Grand.

44:24.796 --> 44:26.389
That's a...

44:26.431 --> 44:28.490
a nice lipstick
you're wearing, Tara.

44:28.533 --> 44:31.332
Unusual.

44:32.971 --> 44:34.700
How are you, Jimmy?

44:34.739 --> 44:37.367
How are you?

44:37.409 --> 44:39.878
He's great. Lovely.

44:39.911 --> 44:41.345
That's five pound you owe me.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.577
If you're
not getting married...

44:47.619 --> 44:50.452
that child ought to go to
St. Jude's Orphanage in Dublin.

44:50.488 --> 44:51.785
The nuns there
will look after him...

44:51.823 --> 44:53.951
body and soul,
better than you can, Tara.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.518
I could bury him alive.
How would that suit you?

44:58.163 --> 45:00.928
You can't fly
in the face of God, my girl.

45:00.965 --> 45:02.797
Sergeant Hegarty...

45:02.834 --> 45:05.030
you could redeem that man.

45:05.070 --> 45:07.596
We can only redeem ourselves.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.273
What is it you're after?

45:55.186 --> 45:57.018
I heard about the daddy.

45:57.055 --> 45:59.490
What did you hear?

45:59.524 --> 46:02.289
Heard he killed himself...

46:02.327 --> 46:04.557
after the baby was born.

46:06.164 --> 46:09.327
Lord God, that must've been
terrible for you, Tara.

46:34.526 --> 46:36.995
What are you collecting
the feathers for?

46:38.396 --> 46:40.125
A hat I'm making.

46:40.165 --> 46:42.998
Oh? Going somewhere special?

46:46.671 --> 46:49.538
- Look at her.
-She's gorgeous.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.566
Look at that hat on her.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.391
Stop this!

47:51.436 --> 47:52.665
Stop!

47:56.875 --> 47:59.207
I distinctly requested...

47:59.244 --> 48:01.713
that no short skirts
were to be worn.

48:01.746 --> 48:03.737
Yes, but the flesh
is well covered.

48:03.781 --> 48:06.978
There'll be some Shakespeare
after the interval, Father.

48:07.018 --> 48:08.213
Will there?

48:08.253 --> 48:12.781
Weak minds are easily twisted
by wanton imaginings.

48:12.824 --> 48:15.293
Why do you think
God gave actresses legs?

48:15.326 --> 48:17.818
Keep God out of this, showman.

48:17.862 --> 48:20.661
Jeez, anyone would think
we were dancing naked.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.496
You're worse than tinkers.

48:24.602 --> 48:26.570
Interval!

48:26.604 --> 48:30.871
You can do all your fighting
outside of the tent!

48:30.909 --> 48:32.604
But this is
better than the show!

48:33.978 --> 48:37.107
Father, I've got
lovely chocolates and...

48:39.017 --> 48:40.985
Come on, move out! Come on!

48:42.620 --> 48:43.815
Come on.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.727
Oh, hello.

48:50.995 --> 48:53.225
I didn't think you'd come.

48:54.999 --> 48:56.296
Are you enjoying it?

48:56.334 --> 48:58.496
It's a great gas so far.

49:06.010 --> 49:08.775
What's this?

49:12.650 --> 49:14.414
Tell me, are you long at it?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.921
No. No, believe it or not...

49:16.955 --> 49:18.514
it's me first time on the road.

49:18.556 --> 49:20.547
Thought as much.

49:25.063 --> 49:27.532
It'll be me last time,
you know.

49:27.565 --> 49:29.897
The way I'm thinking...

49:29.934 --> 49:31.834
soon as this season's over...

49:31.869 --> 49:33.837
I'm going back to America.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.862
- America?
-Yeah.

49:35.907 --> 49:38.968
Excuse me, my dear.

49:39.010 --> 49:40.808
That's a splendid hat.

49:40.845 --> 49:42.813
I made it meself.

49:42.847 --> 49:46.681
Do you sing, as well?

49:46.718 --> 49:48.812
Thomas, "Othello" tonight.

49:48.853 --> 49:50.014
"Othello"?

49:50.054 --> 49:51.818
We must keep the Vatican happy.

49:51.856 --> 49:54.484
I'll see you later.
I don't know the lines yet.

49:54.525 --> 49:56.220
Don't worry.
I'll prompt you.

50:05.770 --> 50:07.033
What's all this?

50:07.071 --> 50:09.199
Play actors, sir.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.436
The IRA exploded a bomb
this evening.

50:11.476 --> 50:13.103
Nobody from
this district, sir.

50:13.144 --> 50:15.704
The boys around here
couldn't blow up a balloon.

50:15.747 --> 50:18.717
And I've had reports of
a rash of smuggling going on.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.219
The border's miles long.
You might as well try...

50:21.252 --> 50:23.516
and stop the wind
from crossing over and back.

50:23.554 --> 50:25.613
This is your last chance,
Hegalty.

50:25.656 --> 50:27.647
Next time,
it won't be a transfer.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.558
You'll be cashiered.

50:48.146 --> 50:50.945
It's a waste of time, Sergeant.

50:50.982 --> 50:54.043
There's not
an IRA man for miles.

50:55.520 --> 50:58.455
To hell with all men.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.082
And women.

51:08.266 --> 51:12.225
...thicken other proofs
that do demonstrate thinly.

51:12.270 --> 51:14.034
I'll tear her all to pieces.

51:14.072 --> 51:17.167
Tell me but this...

51:17.208 --> 51:20.439
have you not sometimes
seen a handkerchief...

51:20.478 --> 51:25.575
spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand? Huh?

51:25.616 --> 51:28.278
I gave her such a one...

51:28.319 --> 51:30.845
'twas my first gift.

51:30.888 --> 51:33.687
I know not that...

51:33.724 --> 51:35.214
but such a handkerchief--

51:35.259 --> 51:37.125
I am sure
it was your wife's--

51:37.161 --> 51:40.893
did I today see
Cassio wipe his beard with.

51:49.974 --> 51:53.842
O, now, forever...

51:53.878 --> 51:57.212
farewell the tranquil mind!

51:57.248 --> 51:58.807
Farewell content!

51:58.850 --> 52:01.842
Farewell the plumed troop...

52:01.886 --> 52:04.480
and the big wars
that make ambition virtue!

52:04.522 --> 52:06.422
O, farewell!

52:06.457 --> 52:08.585
The spirit-stirring drum...

52:08.626 --> 52:10.720
the ear-piercing fife...

52:10.761 --> 52:14.493
and all quality, pride,
pomp and circumstance...

52:14.532 --> 52:17.524
of glorious war! Farewell!

52:17.568 --> 52:21.402
Othello's occupation's gone!

53:07.418 --> 53:09.978
What are you going to do
when you grow up, huh?

53:11.489 --> 53:13.890
What am I going to do
when I grow up?

53:15.226 --> 53:17.558
If I grow up.

53:20.131 --> 53:22.566
Here.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.570
There you are, now.

53:25.603 --> 53:28.573
We can tell your <i>mammy</i>
you're on the wireless.

53:33.177 --> 53:36.943
There's the smile.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.142
Give us a kiss.

53:38.182 --> 53:40.913
Put him down
before you drop him.

53:40.952 --> 53:43.546
He's fine.

53:43.588 --> 53:47.422
Well, are you coming or not?

53:47.458 --> 53:49.426
Why should I?

53:49.460 --> 53:53.021
Come on.
Make hay while the sun shines.

54:15.319 --> 54:17.014
Will you look at this?

54:17.054 --> 54:19.079
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

54:34.972 --> 54:37.236
My own first cousin

54:37.275 --> 54:39.744
That did me betray

54:39.777 --> 54:42.474
And for one fair guinea

54:42.513 --> 54:46.211
Swore my life away

54:46.250 --> 54:51.552
As I was mounted
on the platform high

54:51.589 --> 54:56.459
My aged father was standing by

54:56.494 --> 55:01.432
My aged father did me deny

55:01.465 --> 55:04.332
And the name he gave me

55:04.368 --> 55:08.362
Was The Crappy Boy

55:08.406 --> 55:11.706
I'd stand in the snow
listening to you.

55:11.742 --> 55:15.303
With a voice like that,
you should be somewhere else.

55:19.183 --> 55:21.584
Sure. Didn't he go
all round America last year?

55:21.619 --> 55:24.782
Well, halfway around there.
Halfway round.

55:24.822 --> 55:28.224
What happened?
Did your bicycle get a puncture?

55:29.727 --> 55:31.252
Well, I was
in a nightclub there...

55:31.295 --> 55:33.229
and I drank a drink
they had there...

55:33.264 --> 55:36.564
called a Screwdriver.

55:36.600 --> 55:40.332
By God, it'd make poteen
taste like holy water.

55:40.371 --> 55:41.998
And that was in Philadelphia.

55:42.039 --> 55:45.100
And I woke up the next day,
I was in San Francisco.

55:45.142 --> 55:46.769
I'm telling you,
that's the only way to travel.

55:46.811 --> 55:50.247
That settles it.
I'm going meself next year.

55:50.281 --> 55:52.477
I wish you would.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.516
Go away.

56:03.227 --> 56:04.991
Come on...

56:05.029 --> 56:07.691
while the day's in it.

56:26.650 --> 56:29.483
- See you.
-Yeah, all right.

57:09.894 --> 57:14.229
Tara, you're too fast for me.

57:14.265 --> 57:16.290
You don't do it right.

57:17.668 --> 57:20.399
I nearly burst into laughing
when he led you and Jimmy...

57:20.438 --> 57:22.497
up the hayfield
on that old donkey.

57:22.540 --> 57:25.635
The Blessed Virgin wasn't in it.

57:25.676 --> 57:28.839
He's the maddest fella
ever I met, I tell you.

57:28.879 --> 57:34.079
And best of all,
he's been to America.

57:34.118 --> 57:35.347
What would you say
if your little sister...

57:35.386 --> 57:37.354
ended up in Boston?

57:37.388 --> 57:39.914
Tara, easy now.

57:39.957 --> 57:43.655
You don't know who he is
or where he comes from.

57:43.694 --> 57:46.720
You're a terrible woman
for galloping ahead of yourself.

57:50.835 --> 57:52.735
I'm late. I'm late.

57:52.770 --> 57:54.499
Oh, here.

58:10.187 --> 58:12.815
Who are you waiting on?

58:15.159 --> 58:16.786
What's it to do with you?

58:16.827 --> 58:18.795
It's everything to do with me.

58:18.829 --> 58:21.821
Steer clear, man.

58:21.866 --> 58:23.857
She's spoken for.

58:23.901 --> 58:26.666
Is that right?

58:26.704 --> 58:29.002
She said nothing to me about it.

58:29.039 --> 58:31.474
She wouldn't. She's frightened.

58:31.509 --> 58:34.672
Frightened of you?

58:34.712 --> 58:38.273
Frightened of the truth.

58:38.315 --> 58:40.283
What truth?

58:43.921 --> 58:46.652
The baby's mine.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.288
Ask her.

59:02.673 --> 59:05.108
Quiet.
You're waking the dead.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.735
Back in your box.

59:08.112 --> 59:11.673
What are you doing here,
sitting in the dark?

59:11.715 --> 59:14.980
What's eating you, man?

59:15.019 --> 59:20.082
I can't wait to see
the back of this dump.

59:20.124 --> 59:21.888
Did her ladyship stand you up?

59:21.926 --> 59:25.453
You're safer counting on
racehorses than on women.

59:25.496 --> 59:29.023
I left a wife in Tralee
30 years ago.

59:29.066 --> 59:31.160
Never regretted it.

59:31.201 --> 59:35.160
A woman, a baby,
and a mystery man for a father.

59:35.205 --> 59:36.502
It's dynamite.

59:36.540 --> 59:40.204
They say the paramour blew
his head off with a shotgun.

59:40.244 --> 59:43.407
And maybe she drove him to it.

59:43.447 --> 59:47.315
She won't drive me,
I'm telling you.

59:47.351 --> 59:49.149
Where the hell are we next week?

59:49.186 --> 59:50.449
Tullyvin.

59:50.487 --> 59:51.955
The crack'll be mighty, eh?

59:51.989 --> 59:54.117
"The crack'll be mighty."

59:54.158 --> 59:56.286
How many times
have I heard that before?

59:56.327 --> 59:58.455
"The crack'll be mighty."

59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.088
Will you look at us?

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.565
We're nothing but
a bunch of cut-price tinkers...

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.092
married to the road
and a bottle of booze.

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:09.606
I'm packing this in.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.337
You really need to go careful
in this life.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:15.937
You give up one kind of magic,
you find you need another.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.883
Rather a waste. I was hoping
you'd bring the girl along.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.511
There's bags of sewing
to be done.

01:00:22.553 --> 01:00:24.885
And if she can sing as well...

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:26.617
I could sack Vonnie.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.606
Tara.

01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:52.772
Brendan?

01:00:58.088 --> 01:00:59.715
I've told him the truth.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:02.725
You're lying.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.489
Why?

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:06.826
Why do you think, woman?

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:10.232
If you won't have me,
you'll have nobody.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.131
Let me go.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.536
I'll never let you go.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.973
You're destroying my life,
Brendan.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.908
I love you.

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.672
I love you.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:24.204
Get your hands off her.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:27.309
Now, one of youse is a liar.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:30.321
Which is it?

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.515
Tara?

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:34.286
You're out of your depth here.
Clear off.

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.918
I'm not asking you!

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.758
I'm asking her.

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:43.331
Tom...

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:47.733
Brendan, you're crucifying me.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:53.642
We lay together
not fifty yards from here.

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:56.442
You offered yourself to me.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.915
Show me the man
that could've refused.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:02.783
I've kept your secret
from that night on...

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.879
because you begged me to.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:02.408
It was
a beautiful summer's evening.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:05.882
I was walking in the orchard.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:15.949
When he first came here
from Dublin...

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:18.826
he was the most powerful man
I'd ever seen.

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:20.830
I didn't know then...

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:23.162
the way drink
had nearly ruined him...

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.726
nor the danger burning in him.

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:30.168
I was nervous of him...

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:32.699
but flattered...

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:34.905
so I laid down with him
on the grass.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:38.815
A few weeks later,
I knew I was pregnant.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.749
I was in turmoil.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:46.720
When I told him,
he begged me to marry him.

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:49.988
I couldn't.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:52.758
He promised
he'd keep the secret.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.731
Then just before
the baby was born...

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.671
he started coming to me...

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:06.233
always in the dead of night...

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.267
like a hunter.

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:10.508
Then you should marry him, so.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:15.351
I don't love him.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:18.355
How could I spend my life
locked up in that barracks?

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:25.185
Him of all people.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.230
To hell with it.

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:33.727
To hell with you, then!

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.680
It's our last night here
tomorrow night.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.027
Where are you heading?

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:20.969
Tullyvin, then on to Dublin.

01:07:21.004 --> 01:07:23.871
Could you give me a lift
to Dublin?

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:29.542
If I got you as far as Dublin,
you'd never get rid of me.

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:49.490
You've never been married?

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:51.729
No.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:56.239
For who'd have me?

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:03.339
Maybe some poor soft idiot
with another man's child.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.981
You know, kids don't scare me.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.515
And if he's lonely,
I know how to get him...

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:16.254
a brother or sister
to keep him company.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.903
This is Heaven.

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:35.912
And I never thought I'd make it.

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.413
It's not bad on a good day...

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.575
but it's no good on a bad day.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:43.519
California...
now, that's the place for us.

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:47.046
The sun shines there
24 hours a day.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.024
Dreamer.

01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:51.756
It's a lucky woman
who catches a dreamer.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:55.322
Why did you come back here, Tom?

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:57.959
From America.

01:08:58.001 --> 01:09:01.265
Fate, I suppose.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.788
Holy"-

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:24.057
Look out, we're sinking!

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:43.639
Let's go. I'm frightened.

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:45.198
Tara, come here.

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:48.542
No. We mustn't be
caught together, Tom.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.575
Down by the lake.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:55.051
Then into the hay with them.

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:58.646
Naked to the world. Aye.

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:01.214
Her hair spread out.

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:06.719
Her hair spread out.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:57.204
That's what you call the aerial.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.141
Higher! Higher, man!

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:03.168
Up in the air,
where the pictures are!

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:09.047
A pint and a small one.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:11.019
Huh?

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.421
Don't make a song and dance
about it.

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:32.504
There.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.703
Look at that.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.939
Holy God.

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:38.846
Didn't I tell you so?

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.984
Like a hound out of Hell.

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:05.304
Can you hear me,
creature of the darkness?

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:07.537
Yes, master.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:10.137
Raise the needle.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.980
Approach the subjects.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:16.714
Flesh to flesh.

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:19.245
You powers
of light and dark...

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:21.451
invest this vestal creature...

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:25.792
with a gift that raises
mind above base matter.

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:29.493
For you,
there can be no rest...

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:34.834
until you have sewn
flesh unto flesh.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.635
Begin!

01:14:36.673 --> 01:14:42.874
Sew, creature, sew.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:44.607
It's a fake.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.479
It's candle wax or putty.

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:48.109
I wouldn't count on it.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:50.347
No blood.

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:56.450
Light shall battle dark,
and dark shall be defeated!

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:01.725
Mrs. Smith?

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.193
I can see.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.500
I can see!

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:13.703
That man is a miracle worker.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.677
I can see!

01:15:15.712 --> 01:15:18.010
Nonsense. It's only a trick.

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:20.175
Mercy.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:21.980
Sergeant,
will you do something?

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.214
Keep order, man.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.724
She can see.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:37.327
Thank you, sir. Bless you...

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:40.997
and reward you forever.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.633
There'll be queues
at the box office...

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:49.145
for weeks to come.

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:52.478
He might have
a cure for the lumbago.

01:15:52.515 --> 01:15:54.643
All out! All out!

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:57.051
See the greatest show
on earth!

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:59.350
Come along, everybody!

01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:01.551
Come along, that's it!

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:03.491
Here we go!
The greatest show on earth!

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.255
I'm going
to shake his hand.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:07.059
Freddie P. Fitzgerald!

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.758
As seen on screen and radio!

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:12.825
Come on!
Come along, everybody!

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:14.667
Touch the healer!

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:18.038
Touch the greatest healer
in the world!

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:27.209
Brigid,
did you find me other shoe?

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:39.356
I've come to see you
on official business.

01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:42.023
That's...that's mine.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:43.260
Give it back.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:45.961
No. It's evidence.

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:47.595
I've committed no crime.

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:49.628
Your playboy has.

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:52.369
Last winter, he served
three months in Mountjoy Jail.

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:55.378
Liar. Last winter,
he was in America.

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:57.209
He's the liar.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:17:00.307
I telephoned Dublin Castle,
and they checked up on him.

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:03.547
Three months
for bigamy and desertion.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.923
You'll be going nowhere, girl...

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.189
not with my child.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:13.457
Your child?

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:15.521
Marry me.
We could put in for a transfer.

01:17:15.565 --> 01:17:17.556
We could set up house in Dublin,
if that's what you want.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.931
Please leave us alone.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.527
I can see the fright
in your eyes, girl.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:21.935
Believe me...

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.463
you're not half as afraid of me
as I am meself.

01:17:24.507 --> 01:17:27.738
Brendan...

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:30.371
I have no feelings for you.

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.313
You don't have to love me.

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.339
I love you.

01:17:34.384 --> 01:17:36.512
Can't you see?

01:17:36.552 --> 01:17:39.988
I just need you about the place.

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.923
I can't let you escape...

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.255
not with that fella.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:47.355
Are you blind, woman?
He's a criminal.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:49.229
A foul, dirty criminal.

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:51.700
Get out of my house.

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:53.759
God forgive me
for telling you...

01:17:53.803 --> 01:17:56.966
but you must be saved.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:18.721
There is a rational explanation
for everything on this earth...

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:23.130
unless God and the Church
declare otherwise.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.999
What happened
to Mrs. Smith last night...

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:30.871
it was the cataracts
on her eyes falling off.

01:18:30.907 --> 01:18:35.811
The artist
has a kind of power...

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:37.074
for good or ill...

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:41.846
but God's power is paramount.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.318
There will be
an immediate procession...

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:45.753
of the Blessed Sacrament
throughout the village.

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:48.723
The hour of The Playboys
is past!

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:51.853
Henceforth, dear brethren...

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.988
frequent not dens of iniquity...

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:57.159
nor palaces of sin!

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:02.198
Let's go!

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:26.753
What the hell
are you playing at?

01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:31.094
Don't move, you two!

01:19:34.137 --> 01:19:36.162
You put the heart across me!

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:38.640
Where did
you get the explosives?

01:19:38.674 --> 01:19:39.835
You could've
got yourselves killed!

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:41.037
The truth, boy!

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:43.102
The Playboys, sir!

01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:45.240
We took it out of the caravan
when he wasn't looking.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.476
Which one?

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:49.410
Which one?

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:08.834
- You're a liar.
-Huh?

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:10.999
You've never been to America
in your entire life.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.237
Last winter, you were in jail
in Dublin for bigamy.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.973
What?

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:19.175
Who told you that?

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:21.650
Who do you think?

01:20:21.684 --> 01:20:23.482
Tom, if you think
I'm going to gamble away...

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.317
my future
and my baby's future...

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:27.345
on a chancer like you,
you're mad!

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:29.654
I picked the wrong man
once before.

01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:31.524
I'm not making
the same mistake again.

01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:33.029
Wait, Tara.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:35.190
Wait until I give you
the truth of it.

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:38.428
It was me brother
who committed the bigamy.

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:40.094
I just took the blame
for him.

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:41.331
Why?

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:43.236
So he could go back
to the wife and the kids...

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:45.673
the ones he left behind
in America.

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:47.005
You're full of cock and bull.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:50.013
Tara, all you have to do
is ask anyone in Dublin.

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:51.605
I'm not in Dublin.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.927
Is it Joe Cassidy you're after?

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:13.232
No. The other bloke.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.106
Hold it. Hold it.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.845
You're under arrest, man.

01:22:02.885 --> 01:22:04.080
What's he done?

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.782
Possession of explosives,
offenses against the state.

01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:08.790
Aw, codswallop!

01:22:08.824 --> 01:22:11.794
Have you and the whole parish
gone mad entirely?

01:22:11.827 --> 01:22:13.727
March.

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:18.128
I know why you're doing this.

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:20.397
Oh, yeah?

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:21.961
Out with it, then.

01:22:25.174 --> 01:22:27.404
Come on, man.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.207
You have the guts?

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:30.974
No one knows better
than yourself, Sergeant.

01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:32.242
John-Joe, no.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.612
It's about time he owned up.

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:37.710
There's your secret.

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.116
Move, you.

01:23:02.712 --> 01:23:05.613
Your days are numbered, boy.

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:09.209
You'll be locked up
for ten years.

01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:14.287
Conspiring to cause
an explosion...

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:19.959
membership of
an illegal organization...

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:25.256
endangering the lives
of innocent children.

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:32.035
He's your baby, Sergeant.

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:50.753
You're not fit to touch
the hem of her garment.

01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:06.242
You and the other fella are
not wanted in me house anymore.

01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:08.676
It's too risky altogether.

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:11.203
Go away, you,
you dirty dog!

01:24:15.518 --> 01:24:18.488
What are we going to do
without Tom?

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:21.115
We're banjaxed.

01:24:21.157 --> 01:24:23.888
He isn't an IRA man, is he?

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:26.725
Freddie, he's no more
an IRA man than I am.

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:46.149
This afternoon,
the entire company...

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:48.310
will visit
the nearest picture house.

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:52.378
Good thinking, Freddie.
We're not beat yet.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:00.085
Can't you wait downstairs?
Father!

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:02.393
Now you listen to me, Tara.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.229
My only concern...

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:06.257
is for the salvation
of that child's soul.

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.134
You must marry the sergeant.

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:11.003
He's the natural father.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.134
Do you know what
I'm going to tell you?

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:16.270
You still owe me two quid
on that suit.

01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:32.718
Out of my way.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.869
Tara!

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:38.222
Come on. Come on!

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:52.300
- Beautiful.
-Oh, dear.

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:54.332
I wish I could see it
all over again.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:57.209
You will tonight
when you're in it.

01:26:57.246 --> 01:26:59.078
Will we get away with it,
I wonder?

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:00.775
A civil war
in this neck of the woods?

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:03.080
It'll go like a bomb.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.585
Clearly, Vonnie must play
Scarlett O'Hara.

01:27:07.623 --> 01:27:12.083
Rachel shall take the part of
the long-suffering Melanie.

01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:14.858
In the regrettable absence
of poor Tom...

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:18.697
I myself will portray
Rhett Butler.

01:27:23.138 --> 01:27:24.628
Freddie...

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:29.707
you're too old.

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:36.251
Cassidy...

01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:39.084
will portray
the part of Rhett Butler.

01:27:39.121 --> 01:27:40.714
I, myself...

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:45.851
will play...

01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:48.226
as cast.

01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:01.202
She's a little beauty, Tara.

01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:02.438
If she ever left...

01:28:02.478 --> 01:28:06.039
this place would be
as dead as a doornail.

01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:43.812
Will they fetch enough
over the border...

01:28:43.852 --> 01:28:46.514
to pay our way to America?

01:28:46.555 --> 01:28:47.954
Will you hold your horses?

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:49.981
You and me
aren't through customs yet.

01:28:50.025 --> 01:28:52.756
If you get caught,
your brother will take the rap.

01:28:52.795 --> 01:28:57.255
Wait a minute, now.
It's the God's truth I told you.

01:28:57.299 --> 01:29:00.132
He was desperate to see
his wife and kids in America.

01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:02.433
I had to help him out.

01:29:02.471 --> 01:29:06.840
Besides that, he slipped me
200 quid for me pains.

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:08.809
You lying bigamist.

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:11.108
Tonight only!

01:29:11.146 --> 01:29:15.242
The world famous film
of "Gone With The Wind!"

01:29:15.284 --> 01:29:17.514
Performed in person...

01:29:17.553 --> 01:29:19.715
live on stage...

01:29:19.755 --> 01:29:22.122
with The Playboys!

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:24.148
Adventure!

01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:27.754
War! Romance!

01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:51.286
Did you see that?

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.687
What's Cassidy
doing in the priest's car?

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.690
That's the least of our worries.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:58.284
When did you last see the truck?

01:30:01.296 --> 01:30:03.162
This is the customs patrol.

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:05.599
We're banjaxed.

01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:07.830
We're banjaxed.

01:30:26.555 --> 01:30:29.388
Let me do the talking.

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:36.265
Customs.
Anything to declare?

01:30:36.298 --> 01:30:38.426
Detective Constable
Freddie Fitzgerald...

01:30:38.467 --> 01:30:39.764
Enniskillen.

01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:42.567
We're transporting
a load of pigs.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.629
Can I see your identification?

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.328
Rats...

01:31:44.867 --> 01:31:47.461
the place is crawling with them.

01:32:36.485 --> 01:32:38.180
Would you look
at the two of them?

01:35:14.843 --> 01:35:17.813
It looks like somebody
is enjoying themselves.

01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:25.243
Laughing eyes and curly hair

01:35:25.287 --> 01:35:27.415
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

01:35:27.456 --> 01:35:29.550
Fare thee well, fare thee well

01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:31.821
Fare thee well, my fairy fay

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.227
We're gain' to Louisiana
Eur to see my Susyanna

01:35:34.262 --> 01:35:36.321
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:38.594
A grasshopper sit-tin'
on a railroad track

01:35:38.633 --> 01:35:40.863
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:43.064
Pickin' his teeth
with a carpet tack

01:35:43.105 --> 01:35:45.767
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:47.935
Act spontaneous, can't you?
improvise.

01:35:47.976 --> 01:35:49.137
There's Tom.

01:35:49.177 --> 01:35:52.044
Thank God.
Cassidy's disappeared.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.174
There's half a packed house
waiting out there.

01:35:54.216 --> 01:35:56.708
- What are they waiting for?
-"Gone With The Wind."

01:35:56.752 --> 01:35:59.312
Here, quick.
You're playing Clark Gable.

01:35:59.354 --> 01:36:01.482
I can't play
everything myself, can I?

01:36:01.523 --> 01:36:03.013
I haven't even seen the film!

01:36:03.058 --> 01:36:04.958
It's the same as "Othello."

01:36:04.993 --> 01:36:07.018
Boy meets girl
with a war going on.

01:36:07.062 --> 01:36:09.258
If in doubt,
pretend to be wounded.

01:36:09.297 --> 01:36:11.265
Where's that bastard Cassidy?

01:36:11.299 --> 01:36:13.324
IRA business, I expect.

01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:14.529
He is an idiot.

01:36:14.569 --> 01:36:15.832
We'll still be on the road...

01:36:15.871 --> 01:36:17.635
when their little squabble
is long forgotten.

01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:19.140
Come on, get dressed.

01:36:19.174 --> 01:36:20.471
Bring those clothes, quickly.

01:36:20.509 --> 01:36:23.501
Ashley...

01:36:23.545 --> 01:36:25.206
Ashley!

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:29.909
I'm going to marry Melanie.

01:36:33.188 --> 01:36:35.156
Kiss me, Ashley.

01:36:42.664 --> 01:36:45.929
You're not a gentleman, anyway.

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:49.267
And you're not a lady, either.

01:36:54.643 --> 01:36:56.839
Oh, lawdy, lawdy.

01:36:57.913 --> 01:36:59.347
Lawdy, lawdY!

01:36:59.381 --> 01:37:02.078
Is you warm enough,
Miss Scarlett?

01:37:06.955 --> 01:37:10.220
Why is all of them
fighting all the time?

01:37:10.258 --> 01:37:12.852
They are fighting
for our freedom.

01:37:14.095 --> 01:37:16.257
The freedom to be slaves?

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:19.494
Do I come on yet?

01:37:19.534 --> 01:37:21.366
Strictly speaking, no...

01:37:21.403 --> 01:37:24.338
but you may as well trot across.

01:37:56.404 --> 01:37:59.032
I wasn't doing anything!

01:37:59.074 --> 01:38:01.304
Jesus.
I thought it was <i>me</i> mummy.

01:38:01.343 --> 01:38:03.243
Sergeant?

01:38:05.113 --> 01:38:08.242
She won't leave without you,
me boyo.

01:38:08.283 --> 01:38:12.015
For God's sake, man,
what are you--Jesus!

01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:15.547
You go away! Go away!

01:38:17.025 --> 01:38:20.928
So the saucy rebels said,
and 'twas a handsome boast

01:38:20.962 --> 01:38:25.058
Had they not forgot, alas,
to reckon with the host

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.832
While we were marching
through Georgia

01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:30.895
Hurrah, hurrah

01:38:30.939 --> 01:38:32.839
We bring the jubilee

01:38:32.874 --> 01:38:34.865
Hurrah, hurrah

01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:36.844
The flag that makes you free

01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:41.076
So we sang the chorus
from Atlanta to the sea

01:38:41.116 --> 01:38:45.417
While we were
marching through Georgia

01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:47.512
To be quite honest, honey...

01:38:47.555 --> 01:38:50.991
I don't give a twopenny damn.

01:39:08.076 --> 01:39:10.374
He's stolen the baby!

01:39:10.412 --> 01:39:13.814
Sergeant Hegalty,
he's stolen the baby!

01:39:14.983 --> 01:39:16.883
There he is, Tara! There!

01:39:19.888 --> 01:39:21.856
Sergeant!

01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:24.291
Hand him over. Come on, man.

01:39:24.326 --> 01:39:26.226
Move an inch,
and you'll be sorry.

01:39:26.261 --> 01:39:27.490
Hand him over.

01:39:27.529 --> 01:39:29.463
You'll all be sorry.

01:39:29.497 --> 01:39:32.432
You'll be
sorry most of all, Tara.

01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:34.959
I love you.

01:39:36.071 --> 01:39:38.039
Please.

01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:39.302
Please.

01:39:39.341 --> 01:39:41.241
Brendan, whosoever harms
one of my little ones...

01:39:41.276 --> 01:39:43.836
shall be cast into
everlasting fire.

01:39:54.022 --> 01:39:57.014
For God's sake,
lads, will you stop it?

01:39:57.058 --> 01:39:58.548
Right.

01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:06.233
Yeah. That's it.
Come on.

01:40:13.742 --> 01:40:15.904
If the passion of the people
could be bottled...

01:40:15.944 --> 01:40:17.969
we could all of us
sail to the moon.

01:40:25.854 --> 01:40:28.482
Come on! Get in there!

01:40:28.523 --> 01:40:30.082
Come on, Sarge.

01:40:32.494 --> 01:40:33.791
Come back to him.

01:40:33.828 --> 01:40:36.126
Come back, come back.

01:40:40.869 --> 01:40:43.861
Stop it, Brendan. Stop it!

01:41:01.956 --> 01:41:04.254
Come on, Sergeant.
Get up, get up.

01:41:05.427 --> 01:41:07.987
- Get up!
-Hit him, Tom!

01:41:08.029 --> 01:41:09.258
Get up!

01:41:09.297 --> 01:41:12.756
If I was sober, you'd be dead.

01:41:13.802 --> 01:41:16.863
You'd be dead if I was drunk.

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:19.567
Give it up, Sarge.

01:41:33.755 --> 01:41:36.281
Help me, can't you?

01:43:56.564 --> 01:43:59.590
We came lighthearted.

01:43:59.634 --> 01:44:03.696
Lighthearted we shall depart.

01:44:36.804 --> 01:44:38.397
Thank you.

01:44:42.277 --> 01:44:44.439
Good luck.

01:44:54.322 --> 01:44:56.256
Allow me.

01:44:57.992 --> 01:45:00.188
Fair lady, you're in the way.

01:45:48.576 --> 01:45:51.136
I'm only going
as far as Dublin, mind.

01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:53.273
That's what
I said when I joined.

01:46:21.209 --> 01:46:22.973
Good-bye!

01:46:29.784 --> 01:46:31.218
Bye!
