00:07.632 --> 00:09.050
Previously
on "The Lost Symbol"...

00:09.092 --> 00:11.136
Put aside regrets
and do what you do best.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.929
MAL'AKH:
This belonged to his son.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.639
NUÑEZ:
My friends are gonna give
your boss everything he wants.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.349
They get Peter Solomon back,
and everybody wins.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.809
He can't go back.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.270
-No!
-(groaning)

00:20.311 --> 00:22.814
KNOPP:
Leviathan exists
to protect a secret.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.234
We must ensure the mystery
remains unsolved.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.485
Freeze right now!

00:27.527 --> 00:28.945
-Hands on your head!
-(gun fires)

00:28.987 --> 00:30.238
(grunts)

00:30.280 --> 00:31.865
You seemed real eager
to tell Blake.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.534
MAL'AKH:
Here, you will solve
the great mystery.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.870
If you don't, you will die.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.290
(deep breathing)

00:44.127 --> 00:46.629
* *

00:57.807 --> 00:59.809
(echoing gunshot)

01:11.821 --> 01:13.865
* *

01:32.717 --> 01:34.761
(sharp breathing)

01:42.811 --> 01:44.187
(grunting)

01:50.360 --> 01:52.570
(sharp breathing)

02:01.204 --> 02:03.498
(sharp breathing continues)

02:09.379 --> 02:11.631
(breathing deeply)

02:37.073 --> 02:39.409
* *

02:44.581 --> 02:46.791
(breathing deeply)

03:11.107 --> 03:12.650
(bullet drops to floor)

03:14.444 --> 03:17.238
(inhales deeply)

03:17.280 --> 03:19.449
(exhales)

03:19.491 --> 03:21.743
* *

03:37.801 --> 03:39.886
BLAKE: I don't know
where this falls, exactly--

03:39.928 --> 03:41.971
between insubordination
and treason--

03:42.013 --> 03:45.016
but suffice it to say
I could have you charged.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.851
Maybe that's what you want.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.604
Maybe this is some guilt-fueled,
self-fulfilling prophecy

03:49.646 --> 03:52.732
that you wind up in a cell
just like Zachary Solomon.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.568
I'm not gonna apologize for
trying to do the right thing.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.070
We're not in
the "right thing" business.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.780
We are in the geopolitical
life support business,

03:58.822 --> 04:00.824
and we are pulling
our own plug if we don't do

04:00.865 --> 04:02.701
everything possible
to stay one step ahead.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.078
And some ancient myth
is gonna do that?

04:05.120 --> 04:07.580
Last year, pharmaceutical
companies spent over $90 billion

04:07.622 --> 04:09.124
searching for a new molecule

04:09.165 --> 04:11.292
so someone's grandpa
could have a softer stool.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.087
So I think, relatively speaking,
our search for this thing

04:14.129 --> 04:16.673
is time and energy well spent.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.509
I'm revoking your clearance.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.094
You're no longer part
of this operation,

04:21.136 --> 04:23.680
because you're gonna
take an early retirement.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.808
Second prize was federal time,
so consider yourself lucky.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.814
Rookie move, by the way--
the security cameras.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.899
NSA captures that entire system.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.111
Your hack trigged red flags
within seconds.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.864
How do you think I found out
about your little operation?

04:40.905 --> 04:42.949
* *

04:53.418 --> 04:55.462
I'm sorry.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.019
* *

05:18.318 --> 05:20.570
(line ringing)

05:23.740 --> 05:25.700
ISABEL (recorded):
Hello. It's Isabel.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.369
I'm away from the phone.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.246
-Please leave a message.
-(beep)

05:30.288 --> 05:31.956
Mom, it's me.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.043
I need to talk to you, um...

05:36.920 --> 05:39.714
I don't have my phone,
so I, um...

05:39.756 --> 05:41.758
I'll try in a bit.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.886
Any word? Is she alive?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.805
I don't know.
There's no listing

05:46.846 --> 05:49.057
of a Sophie Bastin
at any D.C. hospital,

05:49.099 --> 05:50.934
and there's no record
of the 911 call I placed.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.727
-How is that possible?
-It's not,

05:52.769 --> 05:54.312
unless someone's trying
to make it disappear.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.065
And you know who's really good
at making shit disappear?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.608
The CIA.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.486
Well, then she must be alive.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.071
Why make her disappear
if she's dead?

06:03.113 --> 06:05.073
They'd just call it
a suicide or something, right?

06:05.115 --> 06:07.492
You're getting really good
at this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.827
The one person who might know

06:08.868 --> 06:10.954
where Dad and Robert are,
and she's gone.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.001
He always taught me
that when you hit a dead end,

06:16.042 --> 06:19.671
you go backwards,
look for the path you missed.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.923
You think we missed something?

06:21.965 --> 06:24.634
Maybe.
I need to get to my lab.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.604
KATHERINE:
What happened to you?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.357
Got any new leads?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.817
NUÑEZ:
What about Sophie Bastin?

06:40.859 --> 06:42.318
SATO:
The janitor's wife?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.154
We think your people
have her holed up somewhere.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.573
If they do,
you can find out where.

06:46.614 --> 06:49.242
Maybe I could
if I still had clearance.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.869
I'm out.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.747
-Out?
-For all intents and purposes,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.373
my CIA career is over.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.667
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.086
I can't be who
they want me to be anymore.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.549
I have something for you--
Zachary's letters.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.135
(car door opens)

07:07.177 --> 07:09.095
(car door closes)

07:10.096 --> 07:11.765
Here.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.226
Did they help?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.645
SATO:
They confirm Zach had contact
with that other inmate,

07:17.687 --> 07:18.980
but I can't go
much further with it.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.732
'Cause you can't
investigate now.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.400
Not without the international
resources I'd need.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.319
KATHERINE:
But you still think
they're the same person?

07:24.361 --> 07:27.489
Mal'akh and this other prisoner
that Zach was with?

07:27.530 --> 07:28.823
I don't know.

07:30.533 --> 07:34.829
I'm going to help you
get your dad and Robert back.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.581
-How? You've been benched.
-Right.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.958
So if you think about it,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.169
I kind of have nothing to lose.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.715
What'd you have in mind?

07:45.757 --> 07:46.925
Your wife called,
said it's important.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.301
But if you don't leave now,

07:48.343 --> 07:50.053
you'll be late
for Bristol Myers Squibb.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.097
-I'll call Emily from the car.
-(cell phone vibrates)

07:52.138 --> 07:54.057
Wait.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.854
Actually, I'm gonna need you
to reschedule.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.899
Now? But the meeting's
in 20 minutes.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.741
SATO:
So who is
the widow's son, anyway?

08:12.701 --> 08:14.869
Sorry to use
your Masonic Bat-Signal

08:14.911 --> 08:16.705
when I'm not part
of the brotherhood,

08:16.746 --> 08:18.707
but it was urgent.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.375
Who are you?

08:21.251 --> 08:25.046
This is a CIA file
on the Leviathan Group.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.800
Diplomats, defense contractors,
Nobel scientists.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.261
It's a real who's who.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.931
Ever read Hanan Mansour's
"Times" series

08:34.973 --> 08:36.933
on the Arab Spring?

08:36.975 --> 08:39.352
No? Won a Pulitzer.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.062
There was a podcast, too.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.355
Really good.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.899
That reporting wouldn't exist
without my intel.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.027
If you know half as much
as you claim,

08:47.068 --> 08:50.071
then you know how far
our reach extends.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.323
Your "Times" exposé
would be buried,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.616
and you with it.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.118
I'm already buried.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.038
I want to locate someone,

08:58.079 --> 09:00.290
and your reach
is what I need to do it.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.127
-(scoffs)
-What about protecting
the wisdom?

09:04.169 --> 09:07.881
Assuming that's still
your prime directive,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.799
I could help.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.428
You get me what I need,

09:13.470 --> 09:17.223
I'll get you your pyramid back
and the capstone.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.601
You find a new hiding place
for them,

09:19.642 --> 09:21.853
it'll be like
all this never happened.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.026
If you don't deliver,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.320
there will be consequences.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.377
* *

10:15.407 --> 10:17.409
* *

10:29.713 --> 10:31.923
* *

10:44.894 --> 10:47.105
Circumpunct.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.652
Eyeball carving in the box.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.821
It's a symbol, a circumpunct.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.365
Suspect it's another clue.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.119
A circumpunct

11:01.161 --> 11:02.954
symbolizes many things,

11:02.996 --> 11:06.082
most commonly, uh,
the eye of God.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.586
It's a symbol for
the Egyptian sun deity, Ra.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.130
Sun is... light.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.382
It's-it's, uh...
it's enlightenment,

11:14.424 --> 11:16.217
spiritual insight.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.264
The sun.

11:24.267 --> 11:28.229
In kabbalah,
the circumpunct is the Keter,

11:28.271 --> 11:30.106
the divine superconsciousness.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.109
In the Hindu tradition,
it's the Ajna chakra,

11:33.151 --> 11:35.111
second sight, third eye.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.114
The ancient mantra says
true enlightenment is gained

11:38.156 --> 11:40.950
by looking through
the third eye.

11:57.300 --> 12:02.472
"Omnia revelantur gradu 33."

12:16.152 --> 12:18.488
"Omnia revelantur gradu..."

12:18.530 --> 12:24.160
-"Omnia revelantur gradu 33."
-(writing with pencil)

12:24.202 --> 12:27.664
"All will be revealed

12:27.706 --> 12:31.459
at the 33rd degree."

12:32.836 --> 12:35.046
* *

12:37.048 --> 12:38.758
Hey. Hey.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.844
You want this to go any further,

12:40.885 --> 12:42.554
I'm gonna need
something from you.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.021
Robert, my time is running out.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.023
This software is used
in assessing

12:53.064 --> 12:55.900
instrumental transcommunication,
EVP analysis.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.402
Uh, electronic voice phenomenon.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.738
EVP, yeah,
like in "Ghost Hunters."

12:59.779 --> 13:01.990
So that's real--
getting messages

13:02.032 --> 13:04.159
from dead people
through toasters and shit?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.869
KATHERINE:
I didn't say that.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.204
It's a subject we're trying to
better understand with noetics.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.415
-Right.
-(video rewinding)

13:11.249 --> 13:13.668
-Ness no...
-(taps keys)

13:13.710 --> 13:15.253
Onsen.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.629
-"Onsen"?
-Yeah, apparently

13:16.671 --> 13:18.131
it means "hot springs"
in Japanese,

13:18.173 --> 13:19.549
which helps us not at all.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.634
Wait, but he said something
before that.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.138
(video rewinding)

13:25.180 --> 13:27.057
(garbled phrases)

13:27.098 --> 13:28.391
Pruk...

13:28.433 --> 13:29.934
"Pruk"?

13:30.727 --> 13:32.062
(video rewinding)

13:32.103 --> 13:33.480
Corp.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.108
-"Corp."
-Onsen Corp?

13:38.234 --> 13:41.446
Some element containing water.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.824
An element containing water.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.910
-What?
-A tank.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.661
-I don't understand.
-Onsen.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.206
-I didn't even think of it.
-I'm confused.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.208
They make water tanks.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.127
Pods for floatation,
sensory deprivation.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.422
(sighs)

13:59.464 --> 14:01.383
The skin on his hands
and neck is inflamed,

14:01.424 --> 14:03.259
which could be from
prolonged exposure to moisture,

14:03.301 --> 14:05.011
and his bloodshot eyes,
cracked lips-- if they weren't

14:05.053 --> 14:06.930
-properly protected
in the water...
-Hey, hey. Hang on.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.765
S-Slow... slow down.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.934
So you're saying this guy...

14:10.975 --> 14:14.729
had your dad floating in a tank?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.732
Yeah.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.776
But why?

14:19.818 --> 14:21.736
What was he doing to him?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.032
(door opens)

14:26.825 --> 14:29.035
(door closes)

14:31.705 --> 14:33.623
PETER:
Where is Robert?

14:33.665 --> 14:36.876
MAL'AKH:
Your concern for him--
it's touching.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.004
He has nothing to do with this.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.506
He's been locked up for one day.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.802
Zachary was confined
for months before he died.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.763
Where was your concern then?

14:51.474 --> 14:55.353
He says he requires you
for the task.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.692
(keypad beeps)

15:00.734 --> 15:02.152
(door opens)

15:17.375 --> 15:19.878
MAL'AKH:
Let's hope this reunion
is productive.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.798
If not, I have ways
to motivate you.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.676
Just ask Peter.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.804
I'll be watching.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.477
(lock clicks)

15:35.518 --> 15:36.728
Robert.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.731
(sighs)

15:41.733 --> 15:42.984
It's okay.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.444
No, it's not okay.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.363
The only reason you're here
is 'cause of me.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.573
We're together. We're alive.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.868
-That's what's important.
-He knows we have a bond.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.496
He knows other things, too.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.708
Peter. Oh, God.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.129
Are you in pain?

16:03.171 --> 16:05.340
A little.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.051
He had me under
some kind of sedation.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.719
So...

16:10.595 --> 16:12.681
He says he killed Zachary.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.266
He says he knew him.
Is it possible?

16:16.059 --> 16:17.477
What?

16:17.519 --> 16:18.853
Tell me.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.064
We think he was
in that prison with him.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.149
(sighs)

16:25.944 --> 16:28.196
Peter.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.115
We're gonna get out of this.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.616
With these.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.579
You found them.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.249
With some help
from Warren Bellamy.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.875
He took some convincing.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.794
And Katherine helped, as well.

16:42.836 --> 16:43.962
Kate?

16:44.004 --> 16:45.338
She's okay.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.966
Did she see the video he sent?

16:48.008 --> 16:49.801
Yes, she did.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.761
There's a lot
to catch you up on,

16:51.803 --> 16:53.263
starting with this.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.851
"All will be revealed
at the 33rd degree."

16:59.269 --> 17:01.396
Look through the iris
into the light.

17:02.897 --> 17:06.109
It's a clue. It's how I got him
to agree to put us together.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.986
You're a 33rd-degree Mason.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.114
I think it means I need you
to help me solve this.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.574
Solve it? No.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.534
We have to figure out
the remaining clues,

17:14.576 --> 17:16.453
-give him what he wants.
-No, I can't.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.747
-Peter, if this is
about your oath...
-It's about more than that.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.332
The wisdom must be protected.
I can never...

17:21.374 --> 17:22.625
-(groaning)
-(electrical crackling)

17:22.667 --> 17:25.045
-PETER: No, no!
-Oh! Oh! (screams)

17:25.086 --> 17:27.213
Stop! Stop!

17:27.255 --> 17:29.549
All right. All right.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.468
We will give him what he wants.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.737
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

18:00.663 --> 18:03.541
This city's a damn puzzle.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.752
Can't solve it to save my life.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.755
Tell me what you're looking for.
Maybe I can help.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.966
Needle in a haystack.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.927
What kind of needle?

18:14.969 --> 18:16.971
Very old.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.932
Very sharp.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.352
Gonna need half up front.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.316
(phone beeps)

18:30.276 --> 18:32.404
-(phone chimes)
-Done.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.042
* *

19:14.487 --> 19:16.698
Using Dürer's magic square,

19:16.740 --> 19:19.743
I unscrambled the letters
on the pyramid.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.620
"Jeova Sanctus Unus."

19:22.662 --> 19:25.040
"The One True God."

19:26.041 --> 19:28.043
And then there's this.

19:34.007 --> 19:38.303
You have cracked riddles
that few people alive could.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.221
Warren said it was a map.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.058
Mal'akh thinks it will
lead him to apotheosis.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.976
He thinks the myth is real.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.187
What if it is?

19:47.228 --> 19:48.688
Not relevant.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.191
"Not relevant" isn't
the same as "not real."

19:51.232 --> 19:53.693
Something has changed in you.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.699
Katherine and I,
we found this old film--

19:59.741 --> 20:01.785
a hundred years old, maybe--

20:01.826 --> 20:05.246
it had a murmuration of birds
and a man standing beneath them.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.040
The Teldar starlings?

20:07.082 --> 20:08.833
(sighs)
It is part of the lore,

20:08.875 --> 20:11.920
but to have actually
laid eyes upon on it...

20:16.049 --> 20:17.842
You know, Peter,

20:17.884 --> 20:19.594
I-I actually have
some other theories on this

20:19.636 --> 20:21.805
-I'd love to get your eyes on.
-Oh?

20:24.224 --> 20:27.394
It's... complicated.

20:29.104 --> 20:32.857
There's a school of thought
in hermeneutic philosophy

20:32.899 --> 20:35.568
which says
that any text or message,

20:35.610 --> 20:38.697
like this one,
has multiple interpretations.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.242
So, to fully grasp it,
you have to see

20:42.283 --> 20:45.286
all the layers, not just one.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.831
Are you familiar
with that theory?

20:49.249 --> 20:52.002
I-I can't say that I am.

20:52.961 --> 20:57.257
I'm still thinking that even
the clues we've already used,

20:57.298 --> 21:00.176
there might still be some
hidden meaning left in them.

21:00.218 --> 21:04.264
Do you have any idea what
that hidden meaning might be?

21:04.305 --> 21:06.766
No.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.519
It's okay.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.898
We are gonna solve this,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.650
you and I.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.447
Together.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.996
NUÑEZ:
So people buy these tanks?

21:28.038 --> 21:29.831
Why?

21:29.873 --> 21:32.542
Essentially,
it stimulates theta waves.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.419
A theta state
can increase creativity,

21:34.461 --> 21:36.171
memory recall, insight.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.590
Augmented with certain drugs,
those states can be enhanced.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.425
Drugs like ketamine?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.885
Possibly.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.720
Yes, Nuñez. Yep.
I need someone

21:43.762 --> 21:46.306
to dig up some stuff
on a company called Onsen.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.768
Yeah. If you could do it
within the next hour?

21:49.809 --> 21:53.563
Yeah. At this number, yep.
Okay.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.815
* *

22:04.449 --> 22:07.660
(door opens, closes)

22:14.501 --> 22:18.088
KATHERINE:
He always dotted his "I"
like that-- a slash.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.925
I remember
telling him once that, um,

22:21.966 --> 22:25.929
graphologists say a slash to
the right indicates irritation.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.558
That irritated him.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.727
(soft chuckle)

22:33.853 --> 22:36.523
How'd it go
with that Leviathan guy?

22:38.358 --> 22:41.111
Are they gonna help us
find Sophie Bastin?

22:42.195 --> 22:43.446
They agreed to my terms.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.657
We'll see what comes of it.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.372
PETER:
"All will be revealed."

22:52.414 --> 22:54.082
"All will be revealed."

22:54.124 --> 22:56.292
There must be something
you know that I don't know.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.212
Knowledge that-that only a
33rd-degree Mason

22:59.254 --> 23:01.089
would possess. Think.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.341
I am trying to think,
but I cannot focus.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.634
My mind is full of...

23:04.676 --> 23:06.219
There's too much noise.

23:08.346 --> 23:09.723
Katherine.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.474
I was having trouble
with my recall,

23:11.516 --> 23:14.352
and she "elicited my
frequency-following response."

23:14.394 --> 23:17.188
And despite your skepticism,
it worked.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.900
The ring.

23:20.942 --> 23:25.447
Custom-forged for the conferring
of the 33rd degree.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.032
With a pi cipher, yeah.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.534
PETER:
Not only that.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.078
It had a very special
construction.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.634
* *

24:08.114 --> 24:10.033
That's it.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.916
Now, I had always thought
the symbol

24:17.957 --> 24:20.251
was for use with wax seals.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.671
Now I'm not so sure.

24:33.181 --> 24:36.935
(sighs) "All will be revealed
at the 33rd degree."

24:36.976 --> 24:38.937
33 degrees is
the measure of an angle.

24:39.771 --> 24:44.150
-So turn to the 33rd degree.
-(clicking)

24:45.151 --> 24:46.403
(click)

25:08.216 --> 25:10.260
* *

25:19.686 --> 25:23.231
This will take us
to the final stage.

25:25.483 --> 25:29.112
A dagger touched by the heavens.

25:35.952 --> 25:39.748
All that is required is blood
from the instrument.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.476
-(beep)
-(door buzzes, lock clicks)

26:07.942 --> 26:10.278
(sighs)
I'm here to visit the patient.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.072
ID, please.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.541
What, no gift shop?

26:25.043 --> 26:27.504
I forgot flowers.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.297
Funny.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.009
Has anyone spoken to her yet?

26:33.051 --> 26:35.470
No. She was in pretty bad shape.

26:35.512 --> 26:39.057
Hasn't said a word since
she regained consciousness.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.435
(monitor beeping steadily)

26:48.817 --> 26:50.902
Ms. Bastin.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.447
I'm Larry Carter.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.491
I work in Operations.

26:57.325 --> 27:00.537
You're in a secure
CIA medical facility.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.455
(groans softly)

27:02.497 --> 27:05.750
Now, I know
you don't want to talk,

27:05.792 --> 27:09.421
so I brought this-- amobarbital.

27:09.462 --> 27:13.550
Indicated for anxiety,
epilepsy, insomnia.

27:13.591 --> 27:16.136
You're a pharmacist.
You know that.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.929
(Sophie groans softly)

27:17.971 --> 27:21.975
What you may not know is that
it has a potent off-label use.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.977
(Sophie groaning)

27:24.019 --> 27:27.313
The right amount of this
in your IV,

27:27.355 --> 27:29.524
and you'll tell me everything.

27:34.988 --> 27:37.532
(exhales slowly)

27:40.827 --> 27:42.912
CARTER:
Sophie?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.290
Now...

27:48.376 --> 27:50.462
Where's Mal'akh?

27:50.503 --> 27:51.921
(grunts softly)

27:51.963 --> 27:53.965
I don't know.

27:54.007 --> 27:55.633
I don't believe you.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.552
Are you lying to me?

27:58.553 --> 28:00.013
No.

28:00.055 --> 28:01.639
(Sophie's breath trembling)

28:01.681 --> 28:04.684
(shakily): He's careful.

28:04.726 --> 28:08.730
Only m-my husband--

28:08.772 --> 28:11.524
he knows.

28:11.566 --> 28:13.610
What about other names?

28:13.651 --> 28:15.528
Aliases he uses?

28:17.322 --> 28:20.492
-Christopher.
-Christopher.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.535
-Christopher what?
-(exhales)

28:22.577 --> 28:23.912
(rapid beeping)

28:23.953 --> 28:27.082
Sophie? Stay with me.

28:30.794 --> 28:32.921
Abaddon.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.681
It doesn't matter...

28:42.722 --> 28:44.599
what you know.

28:47.227 --> 28:51.189
The CIA can't stop him.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.483
You don't have to worry.

28:55.318 --> 28:59.197
The CIA will never know
what you just told me.

29:00.031 --> 29:02.450
That or anything else.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.330
(computer beeping)

29:10.125 --> 29:12.002
(monitor beeping rapidly)

29:12.043 --> 29:14.587
(monitor flatlines)

29:15.630 --> 29:18.425
SATO:
Every tank Onsen ships
to the eastern U.S.

29:18.466 --> 29:20.427
comes in through
the Port of Savannah.

29:20.468 --> 29:23.722
From there, they're farmed out
to various trucking outfits.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.932
We'll start within the DMV.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.059
You get D.C.

29:28.101 --> 29:30.687
You get Maryland.
I'll take Virginia.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.660
Wait, I have a shipping address
here in Georgetown

29:45.702 --> 29:47.662
to a company
called Somafree Inc.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.539
Right. We're gonna see
a lot of that.

29:49.581 --> 29:52.000
We'll have to run down
who owns any of these companies

29:52.042 --> 29:54.085
or shell corporations.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.134
Why are you here?

30:01.176 --> 30:03.178
You've already lost
your career over this.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.055
I told you, I want to help.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.765
But why?

30:06.806 --> 30:08.224
-Langdon is being held...
-Wasn't your fault.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.642
That was your boss.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.311
And I get it-- he's CIA.

30:11.353 --> 30:13.313
He's not supposed to give
a shit about my family.

30:13.355 --> 30:16.483
And neither are you,
and yet here you are.

30:18.068 --> 30:19.569
Why?

30:29.788 --> 30:31.706
Did you know my brother?

30:35.710 --> 30:39.506
You said something before
about how he was someone

30:39.547 --> 30:43.051
trying to do the right thing
in his own way.

30:46.179 --> 30:47.806
You knew him.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.228
In Turkey.

30:54.229 --> 30:56.022
I was stationed there.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.191
He got in some trouble.

30:58.233 --> 30:59.401
The drugs.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.695
SATO:
No. Before that.

31:03.530 --> 31:07.534
He was running
with some young, rich,

31:07.575 --> 31:10.161
politically connected people.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.580
In some cases, very connected.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.751
One of them died in a car crash.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.754
There were drugs involved.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.673
Zach's drugs.

31:23.341 --> 31:25.677
I used it to recruit him.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.637
Recruit him?

31:28.638 --> 31:30.056
I-I...

31:30.098 --> 31:32.058
I don't understand.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.102
She flipped him.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.105
Made him an asset.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.275
Right?

31:44.029 --> 31:46.948
So you're telling me...

31:46.990 --> 31:48.825
what, that he was a spy?

31:48.867 --> 31:51.661
No, he would just keep tabs
on some of those people

31:51.703 --> 31:54.748
he was hanging out with
and report back.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.752
He was good at getting
invited into things.

31:58.793 --> 32:01.129
He could be very winning.

32:01.171 --> 32:03.340
And he was smart.

32:03.381 --> 32:05.258
Really smart.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.427
He was a Solomon.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.681
But he was also an addict.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.770
And I put him in an environment

32:16.811 --> 32:18.897
where there was
a reasonable expectation

32:18.938 --> 32:20.690
that he'd be tempted.

32:23.318 --> 32:25.195
And he was.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.824
And this was your job?

32:32.035 --> 32:34.245
Blackmailing people.

32:35.038 --> 32:37.207
Praying on them.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.501
Sometimes.

32:43.672 --> 32:45.340
I'm sorry.

32:47.258 --> 32:48.843
You're sorry?

32:54.849 --> 32:58.019
If everything
that is happening now

32:58.061 --> 33:00.355
goes back to that prison...

33:01.898 --> 33:04.526
...then all of this
is because of you.

33:07.237 --> 33:11.199
Zachary, my dad, Robert.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.373
He was just a kid.

33:29.134 --> 33:31.761
(phone vibrates)

33:34.139 --> 33:36.307
That's my Leviathan contact.

33:43.398 --> 33:44.983
Hello.

33:46.151 --> 33:47.736
How's it spelled?

33:55.535 --> 33:59.789
As agreed, when I find them,
they're yours.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.340
Christopher Abaddon.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.925
Got him.

34:13.928 --> 34:15.930
* *

34:34.949 --> 34:37.786
(high-pitched tone
reverberating)

34:41.081 --> 34:42.999
(tone fades)

34:43.792 --> 34:46.711
The Rose Cross,
symbol of the Rosicrucians,

34:46.753 --> 34:49.673
Ancient and Mystical Order,
the Rosae Crucis.

34:49.714 --> 34:50.965
"The secret hides
within The Order."

34:51.007 --> 34:53.051
-The Order of the Rose Cross?
-Perhaps.

34:53.093 --> 34:55.136
-What's "the secret?"
-Rosicrucian doctrine says

34:55.178 --> 34:58.723
The Order came from
"truths of the ancient past,"

34:58.765 --> 35:01.768
which offer great insight
into a "spiritual realm."

35:01.810 --> 35:04.145
Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza.

35:04.187 --> 35:06.439
-Luminaries of the Renaissance.
-All Rosicrucians.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.692
As was Albrecht Dürer.

35:08.733 --> 35:10.485
-Scientists, artists.
-Alchemists.

35:10.527 --> 35:13.113
The Rosicrucian founder was

35:13.154 --> 35:18.284
a German mystic and alchemist,
uh, Christian Rosenkreuz.

35:18.326 --> 35:20.120
Later revealed to be
Francis Bacon.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.496
Possibly Bacon.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.581
His actual identity--
still in question.

35:23.623 --> 35:26.126
But yes, ei-either way,

35:26.167 --> 35:28.962
"Rosenkreuz" was a pseudonym.

35:29.004 --> 35:33.383
Another thing these Rosicrucians
had in common:

35:33.425 --> 35:35.218
big egos.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.555
Who else would call themselves
"One True God"?

35:38.596 --> 35:41.391
Jeova Sanctus Unus--
is that a name?

35:41.433 --> 35:44.436
A pseudonym hiding
in a Latin anagram.

35:55.363 --> 35:57.615
"Isaacus Neutonuus."

35:57.657 --> 36:00.410
Latin interchanges
the letters "J" for "I"...

36:00.452 --> 36:02.328
"V" for "U." Isaac Newton,

36:02.370 --> 36:04.497
who was also Rosicrucian
and an alchemist,

36:04.539 --> 36:07.083
as were the others.

36:07.125 --> 36:10.045
-Now what?
-Now what?

36:10.086 --> 36:13.256
You've summarized this
perfectly.

36:13.298 --> 36:15.467
I don't follow.

36:15.508 --> 36:17.010
LANGDON:
Been asking the same question

36:17.052 --> 36:18.887
over and over again ever since
this whole thing started.

36:18.928 --> 36:21.806
It's just-it's just
one cryptic clue after another,

36:21.848 --> 36:23.516
after another,
after another, after another.

36:23.558 --> 36:24.934
-Robert.
-It always comes back

36:24.976 --> 36:27.812
to the same question:
just, "Now what?"

36:33.818 --> 36:35.570
I've been chased.
I've been gassed.

36:35.612 --> 36:37.822
I almost died twice
trying to get that pyramid.

36:37.864 --> 36:39.657
He took my hand.
He put me in a coma.

36:39.699 --> 36:41.618
Maybe you should've just
told him what he wanted to know

36:41.659 --> 36:43.328
instead of honoring
your ridiculous oath!

36:43.370 --> 36:44.746
Right, because
far be it from you

36:44.788 --> 36:46.331
to believe in anything
greater than yourself.

36:46.373 --> 36:47.957
People have been killed!

36:47.999 --> 36:50.835
Well, why don't we just take
all these and destroy them?

36:50.877 --> 36:53.922
LANGDON:
Because then we wouldn't
be able to get out of here!

36:53.963 --> 36:56.716
-(clattering)
-(Langdon and Peter grunting)

37:02.097 --> 37:04.891
* *

37:20.448 --> 37:22.701
* *

37:29.165 --> 37:31.876
This is as far as you go.

37:37.132 --> 37:40.468
You need Peter for your ritual.
Right?

37:41.177 --> 37:42.429
He's "the instrument."

37:42.470 --> 37:44.806
If he dies,
your whole plan unravels.

37:44.848 --> 37:47.017
MAL'AKH:
You won't hurt Peter Solomon.

37:47.058 --> 37:47.976
No?

37:48.018 --> 37:49.769
He's been like a father to you,

37:49.811 --> 37:52.105
more than he ever was
to his own son.

37:52.147 --> 37:54.691
You've always been sharp,
Robert,

37:54.733 --> 37:56.901
but you're in my world now.

37:58.153 --> 38:02.490
Raw intellect can only
get you so far.

38:09.205 --> 38:11.791
Raw intellect can only
get you so far.

38:15.962 --> 38:18.298
MAL'AKH:
Hopefully he's not
a disappointment

38:18.340 --> 38:20.175
like your son.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.010
Oh, God.

38:23.553 --> 38:24.971
It can't be.

38:33.438 --> 38:35.982
SATO:
Let's try this again.

38:38.234 --> 38:39.694
Stay where you are.

38:50.288 --> 38:52.832
(yells)

38:54.626 --> 38:56.503
SATO:
Stop!

38:56.544 --> 38:58.296
Wait, no.

38:58.338 --> 38:59.673
No, it's Zachary.

38:59.714 --> 39:02.258
He's Zachary.

39:11.559 --> 39:13.019
Let's just stay put, okay?

39:13.061 --> 39:14.688
Let these guys do their thing.

39:14.729 --> 39:17.774
OFFICER:
Copy that.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.567
They've got them
at the rear of the property.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.949
Uh, I got her.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.660
KATHERINE:
Dad.

39:29.536 --> 39:31.621
Katherine.

39:33.331 --> 39:34.749
Thank you.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.043
Oh, thank you.

39:38.628 --> 39:40.880
(indistinct radio chatter)

39:41.840 --> 39:43.049
PETER:
You watched the video.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.843
-You watched it.
-(Katherine crying)

39:44.884 --> 39:47.220
My little sundial.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.685
* *

39:53.727 --> 39:55.770
(panting)

40:01.735 --> 40:03.361
OFFICER:
Stop!

40:05.488 --> 40:06.656
Don't shoot!

40:29.971 --> 40:31.389
OFFICER:
Get down on the ground.

40:31.431 --> 40:33.808
-Get down on the ground.
-SATO: Get down, now.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.145
Do what they say.

40:45.153 --> 40:47.155
Zachary.

40:54.496 --> 40:56.706
There is only Mal'akh.

40:58.667 --> 41:00.251
SATO:
No!

41:09.636 --> 41:11.846
* *

41:16.476 --> 41:18.687
(indistinct chatter)

41:25.985 --> 41:28.071
PETER:
It is him, Kate. It is.

41:28.113 --> 41:30.949
-I don't know how,
but it is true.
-Dad,

41:30.990 --> 41:32.784
you've been through a trauma,

41:32.826 --> 41:34.494
and your perception is clouded.

41:34.536 --> 41:36.955
PETER:
And oftentimes,
to win us to our harm,

41:36.996 --> 41:40.041
the instruments of darkness
tell us truths.

41:43.169 --> 41:45.463
We should get him
to the hospital.

41:45.505 --> 41:46.881
All right, watch your feet.

41:46.923 --> 41:48.675
You're gonna step up now.
Watch your head.

41:48.717 --> 41:50.802
-Careful, careful.
-(grunts)

41:50.844 --> 41:52.345
-NUÑEZ: All right.
-Oh.

41:52.387 --> 41:55.765
I won't let him out of my sight.
I promise.

42:00.228 --> 42:02.063
I love you.

42:04.983 --> 42:07.235
(siren chirps)

42:13.408 --> 42:15.160
It's not true.

42:19.330 --> 42:21.124
Robert.

42:24.377 --> 42:26.087
No. No.

42:26.838 --> 42:28.923
-Katherine.
-No.

42:39.267 --> 42:41.311
* *

43:02.457 --> 43:04.459
* *

43:23.520 --> 43:25.397
(sniffles)

43:34.864 --> 43:37.117
* *

44:04.936 --> 44:06.604
(sniffles)

44:06.646 --> 44:08.898
How?

44:10.442 --> 44:12.360
I don't know.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.198
(crying)

44:22.370 --> 44:25.415
* *

44:42.140 --> 44:44.392
(birds chirping)

44:59.366 --> 45:01.409
* *

45:10.752 --> 45:13.004
I need your clothes.
