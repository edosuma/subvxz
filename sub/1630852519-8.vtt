WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:03.655
- I'll find a way
to get the board

00:03.699 --> 00:04.613
back on-side again.

00:04.656 --> 00:05.918
- Dad's dying, Junie.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.181
- I don't know what it
changes, so...

00:07.224 --> 00:09.052
- That's cold, even for you.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.837
- Cardiology. I told you
I wanted to explore it,

00:11.881 --> 00:13.013
but you didn't hear me.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.231
- Yeah, well,
I'm hearing you now.

00:14.275 --> 00:17.278
- Here.
- You're giving us your car?

00:17.321 --> 00:18.540
- I need to purge a few things.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.281
- There's a detention order
against me.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.760
- It's been two weeks.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.154
You said Khaled would only be
in detention one day.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.677
[Kline]: He could be deported.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.550
- Sorry won't be good enough,
Doctor Hamed.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.508
This is your fault.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.381
[banging]

00:34.686 --> 00:36.558
[door creaking]

00:43.826 --> 00:45.828
[breathing deeply]

00:54.750 --> 00:57.274
[indistinct chatter]

01:02.410 --> 01:04.803
- Mr. Jackson, I have your
results from...

01:04.846 --> 01:06.718
- Shh.
You'll scare him.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.678
You see him too, right?
- I do.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.115
- Good. Then it's not
the mushrooms.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.682
[bird chirping]

01:15.292 --> 01:17.512
- I'll be right back.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.254
- The house I bought
in Leslieville.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.082
Quick jog to the hospital.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.127
Needs a little work...

01:24.171 --> 01:25.824
Actually, needs a lot
of work.

01:25.868 --> 01:28.218
You wouldn't happen to know
a contractor, would you?

01:28.262 --> 01:30.090
- Well, my brother-in-law.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.744
He's honest, but he's also
kind of a moron.

01:32.788 --> 01:33.919
[chirping]
- I'll pa--

01:33.963 --> 01:35.399
- There you are.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.142
Try not to move...

01:41.623 --> 01:44.234
- So Mr. Lee definitely has gout
but doesn't want to admit it

01:44.278 --> 01:45.975
while Mrs. Watson thinks she has
everything but actually

01:46.018 --> 01:47.498
just has dyspepsia and...
You missed.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.457
If you're gonna practice,
pay attention.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.936
- Sorry?
- She means me. The vein.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.156
- The trick is to get him to
accept a corticosteroid

01:53.200 --> 01:55.854
before he gets a kidney stone.
Arnold, you with me?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.247
- Yeah. Right.
Corticosteroid.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.944
- Why don't you try tapping
the vein, Jake?

01:58.988 --> 02:00.685
- Tapping it?
- Yeah, tapping it.

02:00.729 --> 02:01.947
- Like this.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.384
See?
- Oh, yeah.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.603
- She needs antacids and
a bland diet for a few days.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.606
You got it!
- Hey!

02:08.650 --> 02:10.042
That was exhausting.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.218
- No kidding.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.176
- Lightweights, both of you.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.352
So I got your text
about lunch,

02:15.396 --> 02:17.789
but my sister's actually
coming to meet me.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.269
- She is?

02:19.313 --> 02:21.228
Can I meet her?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.622
- Sure, okay.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.885
But if you thought learning how
to put an IV was tough,

02:26.929 --> 02:28.235
I mean...
[chuckling]

02:28.278 --> 02:30.019
[Bashir]: It flew that way.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.455
- Okay, I gotta go.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.327
- How did it even get
in there?

02:33.370 --> 02:36.373
- Oh, hey! What's going on?
- Hunting party.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.551
- We need something
to coax it down.

02:40.595 --> 02:41.987
- Coax what down?

02:42.031 --> 02:45.165
- The model's an acute
care surgical response team.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.167
It would decrease patient
waiting times

02:47.210 --> 02:51.475
and expand the scope
of procedures that we can
do in emergency.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.261
Do I want to know what's going
on here?

02:54.304 --> 02:57.351
- It's a bird.
We had it, then lost it.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.484
- Shouldn't you be on rounds?
- What?

03:00.528 --> 03:04.314
I was on my way.
We were just trying to catch it.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.837
- For patient safety.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.449
- And for our own amusement.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.930
- Okay, fun's over.
Get maintenance to handle it.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.891
- Sorry about the wait.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.633
Good news: landing on a wrist
to break a fall

03:18.676 --> 03:21.592
usually means a fracture, but
in your case it's just a sprain.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.420
- Doc, he looked me
right into the eyes.

03:23.464 --> 03:26.206
And I swear it felt like
he could see through my soul.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.772
- Who, the bird?

03:27.816 --> 03:32.299
We tried freeing him but...
it seems he's trapped in here.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.214
- Or maybe we are.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.738
- That might be the mushrooms.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.654
[chuckling]

03:41.046 --> 03:43.527
[hubbub]

03:49.316 --> 03:52.319
[gentle music]

04:04.331 --> 04:06.115
[city rumble]

04:06.158 --> 04:09.379
- Six-month-old with complex
CHD choppered in from Timmins.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.076
- Did they say what kind
of congenital heart defect?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.991
- No and things can happen fast
with infants, Jake,

04:13.035 --> 04:15.690
so if we ask you for something,
do it no questions asked, okay?

04:15.733 --> 04:17.430
- Oliver Campbell,
tacky at 280.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.476
Stabilized at the regional
hospital but thought it best

04:19.519 --> 04:21.522
to fly him down considering
his heart history.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.828
Second SVT episode started
as we were landing.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.222
We lost his line in transit.
- I'm Dr. Hunter,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.354
this is Dr. Leblanc and
Jake Cooper.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.399
What's his previous heart
status?

04:29.443 --> 04:30.966
- He was born with tricuspid
atresia.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.098
We adopted him at 2 months
when he was still in the NICU.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.623
- TA means the tricuspid valve
is missing or malformed

04:35.666 --> 04:37.320
and blood doesn't flow
correctly.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.757
- Any episodes of
supraventricular tachycardia
before today?

04:39.801 --> 04:43.108
- Nothing like this.
- Most TA patients need a shunt
put in early on,

04:43.152 --> 04:44.675
has that happened?
- Four months ago.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.808
They did it here. They hoped
that it would hold him over

04:46.851 --> 04:49.680
until he gets big enough
for the more invasive surgery
in a few years.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.508
- His little heart's been
through so much already.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.902
- It's okay.
- We'll bring his rate down,
try to isolate the cause.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.860
- One, two, three.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.775
[crying]

04:57.819 --> 05:00.300
[siren wailing]

05:02.345 --> 05:05.348
- Malik Lawson, 17 years old,
type 1 diabetes

05:05.392 --> 05:06.784
and severe hypoglycemia.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.612
Blood glucose is 3 millimoles
per litre.

05:08.656 --> 05:09.961
Had a glucagon shot en route.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.876
- He started slurring his words
then passed out!

05:11.920 --> 05:13.791
I couldn't get him to eat
or drink anything even though

05:13.835 --> 05:15.358
I know it's what I'm supposed
to do!

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
- Did you get a hold of Mom
and Dad?

05:16.968 --> 05:18.448
- We're not related,
I'm his girlfriend.

05:18.492 --> 05:21.016
And he's emancipated.
We both are.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.411
- No, we need you to stay
outside, young lady.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.852
- Rhoda, push 0.7 milligrams
of adenosine.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.288
- You have to shock him?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.290
- It's just a precaution
in case the meds don't work.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.813
- Veins are flat! Can't get
a line.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.338
- Intraosseus infusion then!
- 15 mm/15 gauge needle.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.861
- Run that down, Jake.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.645
- Use the medullary cavity
in the tibia as

05:41.689 --> 05:43.778
a "non-collapsible vein"
when the patient is critical.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.302
But even in a baby this small?
- Yeah when we can't wait.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.348
- Will it hurt him?
- He may feel it.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.654
But we're gonna make it
as quick as we can.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.396
- I can't watch.
- Baby, just go.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.963
I'll stay with him.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.791
- Dr. Hunter. Rate's 300!

05:57.792 --> 06:00.795
- Syncope. Non-responsive.
- Jake, get on bagging.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.014
Smaller breaths.
Thumb and two fingers.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.016
Squeeze on one, release on
two-three, got it?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.540
- Yes.
- And eyes on me.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.237
Locating the tibial
tuberosity,

06:08.280 --> 06:10.718
then 1 cm below, 1 cm medial...

06:12.154 --> 06:13.851
[drilling]
I'm in!

06:13.895 --> 06:16.158
- Decreased air entry on
his right side.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.681
- That's because of his kidneys?

06:17.725 --> 06:21.555
- Large pleural effusion.
He needs the fluid out now.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.774
- 60 cc syringe
and a spinal needle!

06:23.818 --> 06:25.907
- Malik has chronic kidney
disease caused by his diabetes.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.692
- We told you to wait outside.
- And I told you he needs me.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.565
- Joanie, can you please?
- No, I need to stay with him!

06:31.608 --> 06:33.697
- It's okay.
What's your name?

06:33.741 --> 06:36.526
- Ruby Evans.
- Okay Ruby Evans,
I'm Dr. Hamed.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.050
I'm going to use this needle
now to drain the fluids from
his lungs.

06:39.094 --> 06:42.227
If you're going to stay,
I need you to take a deep breath

06:42.271 --> 06:43.664
and help him by remaining calm.

06:43.707 --> 06:47.015
- Malik, I'm gonna move
your arm above your head.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.452
[panting]

06:50.584 --> 06:53.021
[intense music]

06:55.589 --> 06:57.808
One millimetre to the left...

06:58.722 --> 07:00.420
- Can someone please explain
what's happening?

07:00.463 --> 07:01.899
- We are giving medication
to Oliver

07:01.943 --> 07:03.553
to help reset his heart rhythm.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.947
- Okay. One, two.

07:08.036 --> 07:11.605
- No change. 1.4 milligrams
more, Rhoda.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.392
- We thought we were done
after we adopted our third,

07:16.436 --> 07:20.222
but uh, when we heard about
Oli we just...

07:20.788 --> 07:23.747
We knew that he needed us.
- It's really admirable,

07:23.791 --> 07:26.271
taking on a baby with such
a complex heart status.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.143
- It's been really hard
for Gary.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.362
He worries so much.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.931
But our little guy
is a fighter, right?

07:33.975 --> 07:35.629
- One, two.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.458
- Give him a second.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.547
[machine beeping]

07:40.590 --> 07:41.939
- Heart rate's stabilizing.

07:41.983 --> 07:45.465
We'll get him up to CICU.
Mags will take you. Okay?

07:45.508 --> 07:47.075
- Actually, I'll be
your resident there too.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.207
We're gonna run some tests
and sort out what happened sir.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.340
- Bruce.
Thank you, all of you.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.689
Thank you.
- Of course.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.822
Good job, little man.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.780
- You did it, huh?

07:56.824 --> 07:59.783
There you are, yes.
[giggling]

08:03.265 --> 08:04.962
- Getting fluid now.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.792
We'll do some blood tests and
get a urine sample

08:08.836 --> 08:10.925
to check his kidneys,
then assess and make a plan.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.623
- We already have one. I'm
giving him one of my kidneys.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.408
- That's very generous
of you but...

08:16.452 --> 08:18.802
there are multiple complex tests
you'd have to do to conf--

08:18.846 --> 08:22.502
- We did them already. As soon
as we learned he had CKD.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.982
- Have we seen you here
before Ruby?

08:25.026 --> 08:26.549
- Not here.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.812
We did blood and tissue typing,
and serum too.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.727
The doctors said there's
no way I'd be a match

08:30.771 --> 08:32.773
but they were wrong.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.557
Mal and I are meant to be.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.820
We won't let anything come
between us.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.785
- Elevated heart rate and
a slight fever.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.743
- Mr. Garcia,
I'm Dr. Curtis.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.528
- Yeah, we've met before.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.747
My fiancee brought me in
a couple weeks ago.

08:50.791 --> 08:53.924
- That's right, you had
that great story about the...

08:53.968 --> 08:57.537
the jellyfish, right?
- In Miami.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.540
I got stung and
the first thing I said was,

09:00.583 --> 09:02.367
"Hi, I'm Sam,
can you pee on my leg?"

09:02.411 --> 09:04.848
- Oh, yeah. You just need
to rub sand on it to mitigate
the sting.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.284
- That's what you said
last time.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.592
- What brings you here,
Mr. Garcia?

09:09.636 --> 09:11.725
- The stomach pains came back
yesterday

09:11.768 --> 09:15.555
and then the nausea really hit
during our groomsmen photos
this morning.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.775
- I remember.
You had acute pancreatitis.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.690
It's very rare
for a 28-year-old.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.953
We put you on fluids and
kept you under observation
for a couple hours.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.869
- At least your organs made
an impression, Sam?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.610
- Can you just do
what you did last time

09:27.654 --> 09:29.699
and then get me out of here
for my ceremony?

09:29.743 --> 09:32.093
It's supposed to be sunset
at Cherry Beach.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.008
- Let's see what your pancreas
has to say before

09:34.051 --> 09:36.227
I make you any promises.
[sighing]

09:36.271 --> 09:42.407
- So he's gonna need a cbc,
chem, lft's, lipase, bbg.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.453
And CT abdo.
- Got it.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.933
You really
don't remember him?

09:45.976 --> 09:48.500
- I see a lot of patients
for a short period of time.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.067
I'm supposed to remember
all their stories?

09:50.111 --> 09:53.331
- Okay, what major life event
happened to me last week?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.420
- You got promoted?

09:55.464 --> 09:57.597
- I turned 30.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.599
You ate one of the cupcakes.

10:00.251 --> 10:03.428
- Marnie Jensen's asthma
symptoms aren't relieving
with her inhaler.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.822
She's been fighting a cold,
her chest is congested.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.172
Did a peak-flow test and
she's in the red.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.784
- Hi Marnie, I'm Theo.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.133
We're gonna take care
of you, okay?

10:12.176 --> 10:15.179
Action plan, Jake?
- Nebulize with albuterol?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.920
- He just gets to guess?

10:16.964 --> 10:20.010
- This is a teaching hospital
and he's a student.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.925
But how is she with nebulizer,
Mom?

10:21.969 --> 10:24.188
- Unless you popped out
of my uterus seven years ago,

10:24.232 --> 10:25.581
maybe call me Shelley?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.105
And the bronchodilator
that works is ipratropium.

10:28.149 --> 10:32.501
Albuterol gives her headaches.
- That's... good to know.

10:32.544 --> 10:35.678
Jake will set that up for
you right away.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.245
- Thank you.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.769
- Mr. Kline,
it's Bashir Hamed again.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.642
It's been two months since
Khaled was in immigration hold.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.600
There must be some way
I can help.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.384
Please call me back.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.650
You're renovating a house?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.217
Did you manage to sell your
place in Sudbury?

10:54.175 --> 10:55.698
- No, not yet.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.961
- And you still have your rental
for when you go back home?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.659
- I know what I'm doing, Bash.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.574
You know you can kick Malik
back to peds.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.272
- No, he's 17, I'll stay on.

11:04.315 --> 11:08.363
- Hey guys, so I kept thinking
I knew Ruby,

11:08.406 --> 11:10.278
maybe she'd been here
before.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.715
This has been running on
the local news.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.196
Her mother is a school board
trustee in Etobicoke.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.502
And she reported her missing
three days ago.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.113
- So much for being
emancipated.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.941
Does that mean Malik
isn't either?

11:20.984 --> 11:22.725
- Iris checked. He is.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.248
Do we call it in?

11:24.292 --> 11:26.294
- She's not a patient so there's
no confidentiality issue.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.644
- She's been pretty clear
she doesn't want that.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.341
- She's a minor who's been
reported missing.

11:30.385 --> 11:33.518
I think we have a duty to
let her mother know she's safe.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.434
Keep me in the loop, Bash.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.177
- Bishop wants to see you.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.226
[gentle music]

11:55.279 --> 11:56.716
- So...

11:56.759 --> 11:58.021
this isn't good news.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.111
Ray Grisholm has filed
a malpractice suit

12:01.155 --> 12:02.809
for the events which led
to his daughter

12:02.852 --> 12:05.812
having to be mechanically
ventilated for the rest of
her life.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.771
- What, is he...

12:08.815 --> 12:11.513
I mean, is he suing
the hospital? Or us?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.602
- All of the above,
unfortunately.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.299
He's been given power
of attorney

12:15.343 --> 12:16.779
and he's running with it.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.695
I know you weren't there
when it happened, Mags,

12:19.739 --> 12:23.481
but the suit names
all doctors who were involved
in Kelsey's treatment.

12:24.439 --> 12:28.965
We took a necessary action
to save her life.

12:29.009 --> 12:32.142
- I took the action.
- All our options were tragic.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.103
I stand by the choice
we made.

12:37.365 --> 12:40.237
This is happening because
a father...

12:40.281 --> 12:43.850
needs somewhere to put
his anger.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.896
- What do we do now?

12:46.940 --> 12:49.072
- Contact your insurer,

12:49.116 --> 12:50.813
get them to arrange
for a lawyer.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.249
Otherwise, your jobs.

12:52.293 --> 12:56.471
Do not let this get into
your heads.

13:06.307 --> 13:09.136
- Sir, I know this is the last
thing you need right now.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.920
With you fighting to keep
your position.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.009
- Don't worry about me,
Bashir.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.706
- Tell me what I can do
to manage this?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.840
- You can play it safe.
Toe the line.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.537
Toe the line.

13:21.104 --> 13:24.412
Everything you do
is going to be scrutinized.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.153
I know it's unfair,

13:26.196 --> 13:28.851
but you already have to
be better than everyone else.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.461
Starting now,

13:30.505 --> 13:33.987
you need to go out of your way
to follow protocol.

13:34.030 --> 13:37.947
No more pushing the boundaries,
no unnecessary risks.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.124
Don't give them any
ammunition.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.953
Do you hear me?

13:50.394 --> 13:51.831
- Hey, Gary.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.400
Well, he's looking better.

13:56.444 --> 13:59.534
Is Bruce checking in at home?

14:00.274 --> 14:02.450
- Did you figure out
what's wrong?

14:02.493 --> 14:07.107
- Well, Oli has a condition
called Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.849
It's an extra electrical
pathway

14:09.892 --> 14:13.287
that can cause dangerously
high heart rate like you saw
earlier today.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.158
- You mean it wasn't just
his heart defect?

14:15.202 --> 14:16.812
He has a new thing?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.206
- He does, yes.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.165
- Can what happened today
happen again?

14:22.209 --> 14:24.602
- Potentially regularly.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.256
Or never.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.519
Or somewhere in between...

14:29.477 --> 14:32.088
- All of this is so much harder
than we realized.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.528
What do we do now?

14:39.356 --> 14:41.402
- You digest the information.

14:41.445 --> 14:44.535
I'm gonna talk to Dr. Fisher
and get back to you.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.892
[gentle music]

15:02.031 --> 15:04.773
- How long did it take you to
feel settled here?

15:06.862 --> 15:09.038
- Should that have happened
by now?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.867
- I can't imagine...

15:11.911 --> 15:15.001
It's just been so long
since I've had to start new
anywhere.

15:15.044 --> 15:19.614
- For your nurse practitioner
clinical hours,

15:19.657 --> 15:21.790
will you be leaving us?

15:21.833 --> 15:24.532
- Who called
about my daughter Ruby?

15:24.575 --> 15:26.969
- That was me, Ms. Evans.
I'm Bashir Hamed.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.971
They're actually just down
this hallway--

15:29.015 --> 15:30.364
- Ah okay.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.409
- Thought you weren't
going to call.

15:32.453 --> 15:35.151
- Social worker was asking me
about my parents,

15:36.152 --> 15:37.675
then suggested a group home.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.764
- You're not going back
to a place like that.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.941
You're not alone, babe,
you have me.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.726
- Ruby Josephine Evans,

15:44.769 --> 15:46.597
you step away from that boy
right this minute!

15:46.641 --> 15:48.121
- Don't upset him!
He's sick.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.036
What are you even doing here?!

15:50.079 --> 15:52.908
- How can you ask me that?
Ruby, you ran off.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.563
I was afraid you were dead!
- Well, I'm not!

15:55.606 --> 15:57.130
I can handle myself!

15:57.173 --> 15:59.480
- And this doctor tells me
you said you were emancipated

15:59.523 --> 16:02.700
and you want to give away
an organ? Over my dead body!

16:02.744 --> 16:04.876
- It's my body,
it's my kidney

16:04.920 --> 16:06.791
and I can do what I want
with it!

16:06.835 --> 16:09.011
Explain to her I'm the only one
who can help him!

16:09.055 --> 16:11.448
- He knows that you can't make
that choice on your own.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.363
Why do you think he called me?

16:14.277 --> 16:17.846
- Parental consent is required
for a minor to donate an organ.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.762
- But he could die!

16:20.805 --> 16:24.113
You don't know him
or what he's been through!

16:24.418 --> 16:26.986
I love him and I wanna do
this for him!

16:27.029 --> 16:29.075
- Spend three weeks with him
without a roof over your head

16:29.118 --> 16:31.947
then tell me you love him.
This is foolish!

16:31.991 --> 16:34.950
- Just because you got
knocked up by the first guy
who looked at you

16:34.994 --> 16:38.127
doesn't mean what Malik and I
have isn't real!

16:39.172 --> 16:41.783
- You're coming with me,
we're phoning the police

16:41.826 --> 16:45.134
and you're gonna apologize
for this mess that you created.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.224
- If he dies, it's your fault.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.011
[sighing]

16:54.752 --> 16:56.711
- She's still struggling
to breathe.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.453
- I know for a fact ipratropium
works for her asthma.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.585
- Which made us think maybe
it's not asthma.

17:01.629 --> 17:04.284
- How long has Marnie been
fighting a cold for?

17:04.327 --> 17:07.461
- Two weeks. It was maybe
four days after she got back.

17:07.503 --> 17:10.681
- Back from where?
- Bali.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.248
With her father.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.946
- Would you give us
a second?

17:19.733 --> 17:21.997
You always ask
about international travel

17:22.040 --> 17:23.477
with a respiratory illness.
What--

17:23.520 --> 17:25.261
- Sometimes, it's okay
if I don't know things

17:25.305 --> 17:27.611
because you haven't told me.
But other times it's not.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.091
You keep moving
the goal posts on me.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.006
- There's also the question of
you making it sound like

17:31.050 --> 17:32.703
we don't know what's going on
with her kid.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.140
- Does that mean that we do?

17:34.183 --> 17:36.925
- Marnie's X-ray shows some
indication of TB.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.580
But that is news that
you have to dole out carefully
to avoid panic.

17:39.623 --> 17:40.798
- Do I look like I'm panicking?

17:40.842 --> 17:43.323
TB as in tuberculosis?

17:43.366 --> 17:45.586
- It can mimic asthma,

17:45.629 --> 17:47.762
and with Marnie's
travel history,

17:47.805 --> 17:49.198
it's something
we need to consider.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.026
- Okay.
What happens now?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.463
- We'll move her to a negative
pressure isolation room

17:53.507 --> 17:55.117
while we work to rule it out.

17:55.161 --> 17:58.120
Your husband, has he been ill?
- We're divorced.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.602
I'll call him.
Ask about his boys too.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.647
- Jake, can you ask Rhoda
to set up the room?

18:03.691 --> 18:05.258
This is just a precaution...

18:05.301 --> 18:07.390
- Do you get a disproportionate
amount of panicky moms,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.349
or are you just not
a good listener?

18:09.392 --> 18:10.828
I don't need
to be bubble-wrapped.

18:10.872 --> 18:15.181
- I'll... I'll let you know
when I hear from the lab.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.096
- My hero.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.012
- How's the SVT baby?

18:21.056 --> 18:24.364
- Ugh. He's so tiny and he's
been through so much already.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.627
How do you deal
with that kind of thing?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.150
- Apparently by irritating

18:28.194 --> 18:30.283
people with aggressive
emotional support.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.849
[chuckling]

18:31.893 --> 18:33.982
Mags, are you dating
my student?

18:36.593 --> 18:40.641
- I mean it's not like
I'm wearing his varsity jacket
or anything.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.339
Why, is that a problem?
- It's a bit weird,

18:43.383 --> 18:45.733
but whatever.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.829
- I already said yes, Charles.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.098
- CT results for
Sam Garcia.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.537
- Pancreatic abscess.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.583
It's not uncommon after acute
pancreatitis.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.193
He's gonna need the OR
for drainage.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.239
- So, I guess that means
no sunset wedding?

19:13.282 --> 19:15.719
- Is he a candidate
for percutaneous drainage?

19:15.763 --> 19:17.721
- Possibly. But either way,

19:17.765 --> 19:19.549
I can't get him in before
tonight, so.

19:19.593 --> 19:22.422
- Unless we did an endoscopic
ultrasound-guided drainage
in emerg?

19:23.031 --> 19:25.076
- That's not something
we would normally do, is it?

19:25.120 --> 19:27.035
- Not traditionally.
But we could

19:27.078 --> 19:28.950
if we had an acute care surgical
response team.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.692
- So you want to send less
patients up to OR?

19:31.735 --> 19:33.955
- Well, patients who have been
surgically diagnosed

19:33.998 --> 19:36.740
spend hours waiting for
an OR slot. Often in real pain.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.134
Appendectomies,
splenectomies, scopes.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.181
All things that we can handle
in a trauma OR.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.489
Your groom would be
a compelling example.

19:47.751 --> 19:51.277
- So do I tell him that
there's a chance he's getting
married today?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.976
- I have to get a radiologist to
agree to do guidance first

19:55.019 --> 19:57.457
and of course,
Dr. Singh's sign off.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.676
- Interrogate and let me know.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.726
- Where's Ruby?

20:05.769 --> 20:08.294
- She's with her mother.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.339
I know the plan was to give
you a kidney but--

20:10.383 --> 20:13.603
- I don't care about that!
I just want her to be okay.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.649
- Malik, we tested
your renal function.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.694
And you've lost 90 %.

20:20.958 --> 20:24.266
- Okay.
- I'll start you on fluids.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.181
And we'll get you
on a transplant list,

20:26.225 --> 20:31.230
but realistically that could
take five years.

20:32.405 --> 20:35.495
- So until then I just...

20:35.538 --> 20:37.714
survive.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.890
- You'll start dialysis

20:39.934 --> 20:42.371
and it will become
a regular part of your life.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.376
[gentle music]

20:50.640 --> 20:53.077
Where have you been staying?

20:55.819 --> 20:57.386
- Friends' couches.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.522
After that, Ruby rented a room
with her savings.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.480
I tried saying no but...

21:06.221 --> 21:07.744
Ruby.

21:08.919 --> 21:11.922
If I were her mom,
I'd hate me too.

21:12.836 --> 21:16.057
- Look, it must be difficult
trying to maintain

21:16.100 --> 21:18.712
your diet and blood sugar
levels, moving around so much.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.322
- I keep up with my insulin.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.368
- I know, but our social worker
has resources--

21:22.411 --> 21:25.327
- I tried that when I left home.
It was just as bad.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.939
- Malik, you can't do this--
- I don't have to talk to you
about this!

21:32.595 --> 21:36.164
Look, I get you just
wanna help

21:36.207 --> 21:40.908
but there's nothing
you can do about this.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.702
- Oliver Campbell has
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

21:52.746 --> 21:54.225
on top of his heart defect?

21:54.269 --> 21:56.227
- And this was the first
onset of it.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.881
- Will they have a decision
today?

21:57.925 --> 22:00.014
I assume you gave the parents
the surgical option.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.582
- Radio frequency ablation? I...

22:02.625 --> 22:05.889
Not yet, I didn't think
I should raise it without
asking you.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.675
- It's either that or wait
and see.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.764
- Well, ablation is risky.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.331
He could have a stroke,
or sustain damage

22:12.374 --> 22:15.377
that could hurt his chances of
open heart surgery later.

22:15.421 --> 22:18.424
- A surgery he might not make
it to if SVT events

22:18.467 --> 22:21.165
like the one he had today lead
to sudden cardiac death.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.429
- Then you think they should
ablate?

22:24.038 --> 22:26.475
- I think they need to know
all their options

22:26.519 --> 22:27.911
to make an informed choice.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.783
- They're going to ask me
what to do.

22:29.826 --> 22:30.958
- And you should answer them.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.960
Mags, you lived their
reality.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.310
- Tricuspid atresia wasn't
my issue.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.921
- But you know what that little
boy is going through.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.402
What all of them are.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.887
- Sam Garcia meets the criteria
for endoscopic drainage.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.976
- Taking a liberal view,
maybe.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.979
He's still at risk for sepsis,
and necrotizing pancreatitis

22:52.022 --> 22:53.633
always needs multidisciplinary
management.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.156
- His wedding's today.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.940
sIf we did it in emerg,
maybe he'd make it?

22:56.984 --> 22:59.987
- And maybe Bishop told you he
wants to start operating

23:00.030 --> 23:02.859
in trauma and you saw a chance
to step up?

23:03.382 --> 23:06.123
- I'd be getting in
on cutting-edge procedures.

23:06.167 --> 23:09.170
- And diverting patients
and therefore funding from OR.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.346
[scoffing]
You have to be smart.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.826
- I know I do,
that's why I'm here.

23:12.869 --> 23:15.002
- Except this is becoming
a bad habit.

23:15.045 --> 23:16.960
You come to me before you walk
into something.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.180
I flag the risks
and you do it anyway.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.531
If you don't trust my advice,
don't waste my time.

23:29.364 --> 23:33.673
- Hey, about what Bishop
said earlier.

23:34.108 --> 23:37.111
- Yeah, well I called
my insurer

23:37.154 --> 23:39.200
and they put me in touch
with a lawyer.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.507
- Do they think we could lose
our license?

23:41.550 --> 23:44.945
- Well, she did say to prepare
for it to take a minute.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.773
And that it's a rite
of passage.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.427
But, most doctors come
through fine.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.212
I know you're not most
doctors.

23:51.255 --> 23:55.521
- Look, it's unfair you're
wrapped up in all of this.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.871
- Well, I am. I am.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.917
And I'm trying to follow
Bishop's advice

24:00.961 --> 24:03.398
and stay focused
on the job. You should too.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.448
[bird chirping]

24:12.712 --> 24:14.931
- The bird,
he's in the ducts.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.419
[rattling]

24:28.858 --> 24:30.947
[heavy breathing]

24:35.517 --> 24:37.476
[door creaking]

24:40.217 --> 24:42.481
[panting, groaning]

24:43.351 --> 24:45.135
[in Arabic]:

24:55.102 --> 24:57.539
[whimpering]

25:02.152 --> 25:04.981
- Ruby?
- I think I cut too deep.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.331
[sobbing]

25:14.164 --> 25:15.339
- He's young.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.298
- He's only two years
younger than me.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.691
- But still a student?

25:18.734 --> 25:20.736
- I took a couple years
to travel.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.957
- Nothing wrong with
some real world experience.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.872
- Oh. She's defending you.
She likes you.

25:25.915 --> 25:28.265
[laughing]
Don't get too excited.

25:28.309 --> 25:32.182
She once carried a sock
around for months telling us
it was her soulmate.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.923
- I was four! I was four!

25:33.967 --> 25:35.795
And it was a really cute sock,
okay?

25:35.838 --> 25:37.579
[pager beeping]
- You already have to go?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.320
- It's just an update.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.235
- Is it the patient
this morning?

25:41.278 --> 25:43.193
You should've seen her.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.108
She saved a baby's life.

25:45.152 --> 25:48.547
- Yes, she's a force of nature
and always has been.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.462
Okay, you can go now.
- Oh my God, Cam!

25:51.506 --> 25:53.073
- What? You'll have
to run off,

25:53.116 --> 25:55.771
and I can't talk about him
if he's here.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.164
[laughing]

25:57.207 --> 25:59.645
- Okay, that's fine.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.603
Very nice to meet you,
Camille.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.519
I look forward to hearing

26:04.563 --> 26:06.390
if I'm good enough for
your sister.

26:06.434 --> 26:07.827
[in French]:

26:07.870 --> 26:09.132
But nobody is.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.226
[in French]:

26:17.140 --> 26:19.621
- You can't honestly tell me
you see yourself with him.

26:19.665 --> 26:22.624
- He's sweet. He's funny.
He's smart.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.974
- And he will do anything
you want to make you happy.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.151
At least he's in keeping
with your pattern.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.806
- No, he's not! What pattern?
What are you talking about?

26:30.850 --> 26:34.331
- It's either someone
who withholds validation

26:34.375 --> 26:36.159
or someone
who worships you.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.292
You honestly don't see that?

26:38.901 --> 26:41.643
Look I get it. You've had
a terrible few months.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.471
But letting this boy fall
in love with you

26:43.514 --> 26:45.604
so you can feel better
about yourself,

26:45.647 --> 26:47.388
it's the wrong answer, Mag.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.653
- Just once I wish you could
tell me what I want to hear.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.662
- Do we have a patient
with bedsores?

27:00.706 --> 27:02.533
Because I'm an expert,
if you want advice.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.361
- Did you need me for something,
Arnold?

27:04.405 --> 27:06.886
- Sam's pain's is at an 8.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.236
And not just because
he finally told his fiancee

27:09.279 --> 27:10.803
he can't make their wedding.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.761
- Give him another 10 milligrams
of morphine.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.937
It's gonna be a few hours before
his surgery.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.723
How do you know so much
about bedsores?

27:17.766 --> 27:20.595
- Before I came to emerg, I was
a hospice nurse.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.379
Hard to avoid them in
that field.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.251
Why?

27:31.998 --> 27:34.000
[phones ringing]

27:39.483 --> 27:41.703
- Oh, baby--
- Don't, okay?

27:41.747 --> 27:43.313
I already know what
you're thinking.

27:43.357 --> 27:46.752
- Baby, I was afraid to ask
if this was starting up again.

27:46.795 --> 27:49.102
- You have experience
with this?

27:49.145 --> 27:51.757
- When I was little, it was just
pinching and scratching.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.062
Then it got worse.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.629
- Seeing a psychologist
has helped.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.718
- Yeah, once you accepted
I needed to.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.068
- I wasn't raised
to reach out for help

27:59.112 --> 28:01.244
with these problems
like these.

28:01.288 --> 28:02.768
- Many people aren't.

28:02.811 --> 28:06.336
- She's given me some good
tools, but sometimes it's...

28:06.380 --> 28:08.208
I don't know.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.079
- A hard pattern to break?

28:10.123 --> 28:13.517
- This is why Malik's bad
for you, honey.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.651
He's too unstable.
- You're wrong, Mom.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.001
Sharing our burdens
makes us stronger.

28:19.045 --> 28:22.701
I know his and he knows mine.
And look...

28:24.180 --> 28:25.965
No fresh cuts,

28:27.183 --> 28:28.968
just old scars.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.711
Today was the first time
in months.

28:33.363 --> 28:37.193
He helps me, you need
to let me help him back.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.069
- Those are the only options?

28:43.112 --> 28:47.508
Do this ablation procedure or
wait and see if the SVT recurs?

28:47.551 --> 28:50.598
- There's medication that we can
try to prevent future episodes,

28:50.641 --> 28:51.773
but there's no guarantee.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.601
- No. No surgery.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.081
- You heard her.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.822
These episodes could keep
happening if we don't do it.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.084
- It could. Not will.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.999
The medication might help.
We should wait.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.565
- You wanted to wait
to chopper him here,

29:01.609 --> 29:03.785
but if we hadn't brought him--
- He's just a baby, Bruce!

29:03.829 --> 29:05.744
How much more can we ask him
to go through?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.357
- What about you?

29:11.532 --> 29:14.187
What would you do if
he was yours?

29:17.625 --> 29:19.105
- I don't know.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.455
- Because both options are
terrible!

29:21.498 --> 29:23.283
- I'm sorry.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.980
- Do we...

29:25.024 --> 29:27.113
Do we need to decide
this second?

29:27.156 --> 29:29.680
- No. And if you do choose
the ablation,

29:29.724 --> 29:32.161
it won't be today.
So...

29:32.205 --> 29:36.165
Take your time,
think about it.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.738
[gentle music]

29:45.435 --> 29:47.089
- What's happened to Malik?

29:47.133 --> 29:49.744
- We were about to start
dialysis when his breathing
worsened.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.705
- What's going on?
- Fluid in his lungs again.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.142
Claire?
- On it.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.449
[machine beeping rapidly]

29:59.493 --> 30:00.799
- What do you need, Bash?

30:00.842 --> 30:03.062
- Help with thoracentesis.
Guide placement.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.502
Puncturing now.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.286
- About to enter pleural
cavity.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.246
Good.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.119
- O2 sats aren't really moving.
- This is the second time

30:17.163 --> 30:19.034
this has happened to him,
he's in kidney failure.

30:19.078 --> 30:21.036
- The fluid's gonna continue
to accumulate.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.472
- He needs the OR - VATS
pleurodesis.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.387
- What does that mean?
- It's a surgical procedure

30:24.431 --> 30:26.563
that seals up the space between
his chest and his lungs,

30:26.607 --> 30:28.130
or this will keep happening.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.132
- Thoracics can't take him
for at least another 8 hours.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.047
Excuse me.
- Can he wait that long?

30:32.091 --> 30:34.223
- He'll have to.
I'll put a drain in,

30:34.267 --> 30:35.703
and we'll monitor him
until they have time.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.574
- Unless we do a chemical
pleurodesis here.

30:37.618 --> 30:41.665
- That's a risk in emerg.
- It's talc in a chest tube.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.711
It'll expedite dialysis.
We know he needs it.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.408
It makes sense, Bash.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.932
- Call an attending?

30:47.802 --> 30:49.238
- You guys should wait outside.

30:49.282 --> 30:52.459
- I wanna stay. Please!
- Baby. Let's let them work.

30:52.502 --> 30:56.898
- We need talc - 10 grams
in a 250 ml sterile isotonic

30:56.942 --> 30:58.465
sodium chloride solution.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.815
I'll start on the tube,
you wanna prep the agent?

31:01.685 --> 31:03.209
- Bash?
- What's happening?

31:03.252 --> 31:05.602
- He needs a chemical
pleurodesis.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.778
Are you sure you
don't want in on this?

31:07.822 --> 31:09.563
- You guys have it.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.435
- I need a 28 French
and two guarded clamps.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.916
[dramatic music]

31:19.268 --> 31:23.055
- So, scale of one
to Titanic?

31:23.098 --> 31:25.057
- You were fine.
Cam is insane.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.060
- Because if I said anything--
- No.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.410
- Marnie is negative for TB.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.586
- That's a relief.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.675
Although I guess it means
that we're back to not knowing.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.329
Did you want me to work up
a differential?

31:36.372 --> 31:39.114
- Sure, but respirology will
have to weigh in.

31:39.158 --> 31:42.901
And this is complex - so you're
aware of the expectations.

31:45.773 --> 31:48.645
- You know certain
fungal infections can mimic TB.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.431
I'd look into any environmental
exposures if I were you.

31:51.474 --> 31:54.260
- She did say that she was
playing on a compost pile

31:54.303 --> 31:56.175
with her brothers.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.611
You're incredible.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.395
- Why are you still here?

31:59.439 --> 32:01.310
Go, go cross-reference with
her symptoms.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.753
[indistinct chatter]

32:11.016 --> 32:12.234
- The wedding came to him?

32:12.278 --> 32:13.888
- We didn't think Sam
was a good candidate

32:13.932 --> 32:15.281
for draining in trauma.

32:15.324 --> 32:18.458
- Hmm. Not to mention
Dr. Singh detested my idea

32:18.501 --> 32:20.851
of an acute care surgical
response team.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.331
- Yeah, passionately.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.291
- And the kidney failure
patient? The ED pleurodesis?

32:25.334 --> 32:27.075
What will he make of that?

32:27.119 --> 32:28.772
- I haven't mentioned it
yet but--

32:28.816 --> 32:30.035
- That patient was a candidate,

32:30.078 --> 32:31.993
and I'll defend it to any
surgeons

32:32.037 --> 32:33.995
that wants to take issue.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.825
How are you doing, June?

32:37.868 --> 32:41.002
Being Chief Resident,
caught between the egos and
the politics...

32:41.046 --> 32:43.265
- It's just hard to know whose
interests you're serving,

32:43.309 --> 32:44.658
you know, who you can trust.

32:44.701 --> 32:48.488
- All I know is patient first
is our true north.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.100
Keep an open mind about what
I'm proposing.

32:52.144 --> 32:55.669
If you find a candidate
that fits the bill, I'll have
your back.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.674
- Khaled appealed his
asylum case

33:00.717 --> 33:02.110
because you said he had
a chance.

33:02.154 --> 33:03.982
Now he's stuck in jail!

33:04.025 --> 33:06.549
[Kline]: I've been trying
to argue for his conditional
release.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.682
Beyond that--
- Don't say there's nothing
I can do.

33:08.725 --> 33:11.424
[Kline]: I'm sorry doctor,
but it is the case.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.774
Listen, I'll call if anything
changes.

33:14.993 --> 33:19.345
- Dr. Hamed, how long do
these sessions usually take?

33:19.388 --> 33:21.347
His dialysis.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.044
- Three hours, four times
a week.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.872
- Well, I feel for him,

33:24.915 --> 33:27.483
but he's gonna have to learn to
make health his priority.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.530
- What alone?
Without any support?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.967
- She's just a child!
- Your daughter got him to do

33:33.011 --> 33:36.362
what apparently no one else can,
confide in her.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.799
And like it or not,
she trusts him too.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.671
- This is none of your damn
business.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.808
- She got sick
from my compost pile?

33:47.851 --> 33:49.984
- I'll have Jake here
explain it

33:50.028 --> 33:52.552
since we have him to thank
for the revelation.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.684
- Yeah, well, Marnie likely has

33:54.728 --> 33:56.382
"allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis".

33:56.425 --> 33:59.950
It's an infection
from a fungus commonly
found in compost bins.

33:59.994 --> 34:03.302
And the effects resemble
asthma, or TB.

34:03.345 --> 34:06.522
But the good new is,
it's not contagious and
totally treatable.

34:06.566 --> 34:10.264
- Wow. Okay.
So what are the next steps?

34:10.309 --> 34:12.353
- Well, we'll swab to confirm,

34:12.398 --> 34:14.356
but Marnie will be on
the mend for a few days.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.097
- Shall I go fix you boys
some cocktails

34:16.141 --> 34:17.489
while you finish chatting?

34:17.533 --> 34:19.840
Wow, the second a man's
in the room.

34:19.882 --> 34:23.103
- Stand down, soldier.
I have a magnetic presence.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.498
It's why you fell for me.
- And why I left you.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.282
- Have you been doing this
all day?

34:27.326 --> 34:28.804
Stop terrifying the doctors.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.025
- You're not scared of me,
are you, Dr. Hunter?

34:36.291 --> 34:39.120
[machine beeping rapidly]

34:39.164 --> 34:40.382
- It's happening again!

34:40.426 --> 34:41.862
He was awake and smiling
and then--

34:41.905 --> 34:44.647
- Let's give him 0.7 milligrams
of adenosine, Nelly.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.911
Okay. One, two.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.960
- Why isn't it working?
- He's still at 300 bpm.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.788
We need to cardiovert.
3.5 joules.

34:55.266 --> 34:58.139
On my mark.
Ready, and clear!

34:58.183 --> 35:00.881
[thump]
[sobbing]

35:02.187 --> 35:03.275
Again. 7 joules.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.799
Ready, and clear!
[thump]

35:06.365 --> 35:08.193
[beeping]

35:10.586 --> 35:12.458
Give him a minute.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.590
Come on, come on, Oli.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.941
Okay, he's stabilizing.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.682
[sighing]

35:31.912 --> 35:34.132
- This isn't going to stop,
is it?

35:36.177 --> 35:38.048
- I think you should do
the ablation.

35:38.092 --> 35:41.139
- You said it could kill him!
- There are risks either way.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.880
But your son is a fighter,

35:43.924 --> 35:45.752
and it gives him
the best chance.

35:54.108 --> 35:57.024
Okay. It'll take a few days
to schedule

35:57.067 --> 35:59.157
and Dr. Fisher will do
the procedure, but I promise

35:59.200 --> 36:01.594
that I'll be with you every
step of the way.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.691
[gentle music]

36:23.703 --> 36:25.313
[deep exhale]

36:33.582 --> 36:36.846
- You didn't mention me
that you treated Ruby
for cutting herself.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.502
I'm just going over today's
patient intakes.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.940
- It was right before
Malik crashed again. I'm sorry.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.029
- It's not that. It's just,
you realize that

36:46.073 --> 36:47.509
with her history of
self-harm,

36:47.553 --> 36:49.511
it's unlikely she'll be able
to donate a kidney.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.209
- Even if she keeps it
under control?

36:51.252 --> 36:52.688
- Still a tough sell.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.995
Donors often experience
depression post-op.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.779
There's pretty strict rules
on mental health.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.521
- Then it's a death sentence
for this kid, Theo.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.525
- Look, man, I heard about
the lawsuit.

37:03.569 --> 37:04.961
I know what it's like.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.399
- You've been sued?
- I'm being sued.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.402
For custody.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.885
- Theo, I...
- Just-- You have to tell them.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.365
Ruby and Malik.

37:17.409 --> 37:19.585
They need to know what
they're facing.

37:25.939 --> 37:29.334
- Since when did you start
drinking fancy apricot beer,
anyways?

37:29.377 --> 37:31.988
- You're free to buy
your own.

37:32.032 --> 37:35.644
- I feel like I'm 16 again
and you're bootlegging for me.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.342
- I did that one time.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.387
You ended up throwing up
all over Taneesha's car.

37:39.431 --> 37:40.997
Which she made me pay
to have it cleaned.

37:41.041 --> 37:44.000
- You're the one who insisted
I go camping with you guys.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.089
Remember?
- I had no choice.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.222
- What do you mean,
you had no choice?

37:49.876 --> 37:52.966
- Dad took out a second
mortgage on the house
without telling Mom.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.577
I came home, she's screaming,
packing up all his stuff.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.581
So I had to get you out
of the house for the weekend.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.280
- When we got back,
she was fine.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.065
- And Dad was "on the road"
for a month.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.893
- Yeah, but he was a management
consultant!

38:06.936 --> 38:08.590
He always travelled for--

38:10.984 --> 38:12.899
That one wasn't for work.

38:13.334 --> 38:17.382
- She threw him out
and he wormed his way back in.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.209
Again.

38:21.995 --> 38:24.171
- What else am I
remembering wrong?

38:25.172 --> 38:27.348
[gentle music]

38:27.392 --> 38:31.178
I'm sorry that you had
to build those walls, June.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.136
- I have enough bad memories,
you know.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.313
I just wanted you to have
good ones.

38:38.359 --> 38:40.143
- Well, you're off the hook.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.884
It's time for Dad's
night meds.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.364
- You should change his
mattress.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.323
Gel or foam will help
the bedsores.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.850
- Isn't that kind of helpful
advice against the rules?

38:51.894 --> 38:53.505
- I'm giving you advice,
not him.

38:53.548 --> 38:56.812
And trusting you not to tell me
whether or not you take it.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.553
- Thanks, Junie.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.294
- Yeah.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.954
- Is that your secret identity?

39:07.997 --> 39:10.435
- Yeah I keep the cape
in the bag.

39:10.478 --> 39:13.916
You know, in case I see a cat
in a tree on my way home.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.658
- So, Marnie's
in respirology now

39:16.702 --> 39:19.008
with a much less
accommodating doctor.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.273
Justin's gonna spend the night
with her since I took the day.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.885
So?

39:29.105 --> 39:32.979
Wow, you're really going
to make me ask you, huh?

39:33.022 --> 39:35.416
- Ask what?

39:35.460 --> 39:37.375
- If you wanna come home
with me.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.987
To be clear, if you wanna have
sex with me.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.990
[chuckling]
- Yeah. Um...

39:44.033 --> 39:46.558
What about your husband?
- Ex-husband.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.690
Though I'm sure he'd be
delighted if you felt compelled

39:48.734 --> 39:49.952
to ask him for his blessing.

39:49.996 --> 39:53.347
- I'm your daughter's doctor.
- Ex-doctor.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.044
What else you got?

39:56.394 --> 39:59.788
- I thought you hated me.
- Don't overthink it.

40:10.538 --> 40:13.280
- I'm sorry. I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear.

40:14.673 --> 40:17.066
- There must be something
you can do!

40:17.110 --> 40:18.590
- There isn't.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.418
It's okay, babe.
- No!

40:20.461 --> 40:22.768
We'll make dialysis work
until you get a kidney.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.900
I'll find us a place to live,
get a part-time job.

40:24.944 --> 40:28.077
- I'll go to one of the group
homes if the social worker's
still around.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.862
- I can reach out
if you think you're ready.

40:29.905 --> 40:32.212
- Mal, you don't want that!
- Ruby, it's better this way.

40:32.255 --> 40:33.692
I'm not dragging you down
with me.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.955
- Stop this foolishness,
both of you.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.437
- He'll come and live
with us.

40:40.176 --> 40:41.700
He can stay in our guest room.

40:41.743 --> 40:44.006
I'll make sure he gets
to dialysis.

40:44.050 --> 40:46.879
- No, Ms. Evans,
I couldn't do that.

40:46.922 --> 40:49.925
- You deserve a fair chance
to fight this off.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.668
I'm not taking no for
an answer.

40:54.364 --> 40:57.411
If I can't convince you,
I know Ruby can.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.333
- You don't know how much this
means to me.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.944
- We'll find a way to get
through.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.470
[soft music]

41:29.051 --> 41:31.314
- It's a good thing
you're doing.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.621
- What choice did I have?

41:33.969 --> 41:36.015
Turn my back and lose
my daughter?

41:36.058 --> 41:38.278
I don't like this thing
between them.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.062
But I can't stop it.

41:40.846 --> 41:43.501
All I can do now
is let it happen.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.380
[bird chirping]
