being stuck up on Mars
with Matt Damon?

00:10.211 --> 00:11.445
(ALL CHUCKLING)

00:11.512 --> 00:14.115
I just fantasized about
being alone for that long.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.285
Two months solo on Mars?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.353
Aw, it'd be so quiet.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.454
(DOOR OPENS)

00:20.521 --> 00:21.755
Ah-ooh!

00:21.822 --> 00:23.557

ladies in the house.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.658
(CHUCKLES)

00:24.725 --> 00:26.660
Ooh, what do we
got our noses in?

00:26.727 --> 00:29.230
Zoink. (LAUGHS)

00:29.297 --> 00:31.065
We're discussing
The Martian.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.867
Ah, kind of saving
that for a beach read.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.703
You guys mind if we gab
about something else?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.705
Just reread
Superfudge with Dave,

00:37.771 --> 00:40.474
so that's still
fresh in the noggs.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.010
Isn't there anything else
you could be doing?

00:43.077 --> 00:45.813
Ugh, this one thinks
I need a hobby

00:45.879 --> 00:47.815
so I don't feel the
need to come in here

00:47.881 --> 00:49.450
and hijack her book club,

00:49.517 --> 00:52.019
or her Pilates class,
or her showers.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.224
You know, Ken, if you're
looking for something to do,

00:56.290 --> 00:57.525
my husband
runs this...

00:57.591 --> 01:00.494
He's in.
Is it happening now?
Can it be now?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.130
Whoa, whoa, Allison,
let her finish.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.231
I know Gary.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.966
Smart money says it's lame.
So what is it?

01:06.033 --> 01:08.836
It's actually a professional
Korean men's group.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.439
They do civic projects
and community building.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.107
He finds it
really rewarding.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.875
(GROANS)

01:16.076 --> 01:17.111
Sorry, Jill.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.912
Sort of nodded off
after "civic projects."

01:18.979 --> 01:21.649
Needless to say,
the answer is, uh, no.

01:21.715 --> 01:22.783
(CHUCKLES)

01:22.850 --> 01:24.152
Well, if you change
your mind...

01:24.218 --> 01:25.253
I won't.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.887
(CHUCKLES)

01:26.954 --> 01:28.822
Ken, I'm begging you.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.058
Go.
Mmm, you don't have
to ask me twice.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.460
I did have
to ask you twice.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.595
Ah, all right,
I get it.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.963

01:36.029 --> 01:39.133
I'm gonna go upstairs
and plow a Castle marathon.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.768
Ooh. XOXO.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.436
Sincerely, Ken.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.340
And now you know
why I want to go to Mars.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.382
Hey, guys?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
Guys, I just walked
past Pat's office,

01:56.517 --> 01:59.587
and, well, have you seen
Pat's office in a while?

01:59.653 --> 02:03.090
I try to avoid Pat's office
because it often contains Pat.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.258
No offense.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.426
I know you and Pat
boned a bunch of times.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.597
Okay.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.898
But I think you might
want to take a look.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.436
Is he...living here?

02:15.503 --> 02:16.804
Yes, he is.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.373
Why?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.175
My divorce was finalized
over the weekend,

02:21.242 --> 02:22.910
and Tiffany
got everything.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.447
She got the house, my boat,
and half of will to live.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.283
But I've got the other half,
and I am holding strong.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.485
Pat, are you okay?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.086
Ah, never better.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.088
Yeah, I've slashed my commute
time to 10 seconds,

02:35.155 --> 02:37.157
and I no longer have to look
at the parade of men

02:37.225 --> 02:39.227
going in and out
of my ex-wife's house.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.728
I mean,
I still can if I want to,

02:40.794 --> 02:42.896
but now it's my choice.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.300
Here you guys are.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.470
Wow, living
in your office, huh?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.004
Rough.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.007
Well, it's...
So, check this out, guys.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.076
I get home last night,
no offense, Pat,

02:56.143 --> 02:57.811
and Allison
starts in again

02:57.878 --> 02:59.347
about how I don't
have any hobbies.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.114
Ah, you got
to have hobbies.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.884
If I didn't have my
kickboxing class as an outlet,

03:03.951 --> 03:05.386
the watercolors I do
in my painting class

03:05.453 --> 03:07.488
would be really dark.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.057
Wait, Do all you
guys have hobbies?

03:10.123 --> 03:12.125
I'm a magician's
assistant.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.263
So, what, does he,
like, cut you in half?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.764
Oh, no, no.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.699
It's mostly coffee runs,
administrative stuff.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.501
What about you?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.470
Well, I'm in the
Big Brother program.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.704
Every other weekend,

03:23.771 --> 03:26.607
a guy named Milton
takes me to the movies.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.278
Well, twice a week,
I play a little street
basketball in Compton.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.713
Yeah, the fellas there
call me Paste.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.349
I think it's 'cause I really
stick to my man on defense.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.051
Mm, yeah,
that's probably why.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.489
I don't know.
Maybe Allison's right.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.624
This men's club thing
might be worth trying.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.793
You know,
meet some new people,
get out of her hair.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.895
Well, I know
that's why Tayshaun
and Li'l Cookie

03:47.961 --> 03:50.964
play ball every Thursday.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.234
To hear them tell it,
their shorties
constantly be trippin'.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.411
Dave,
I need your help.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.512
Are you busy?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.980
Physically? No.
Mentally? Very.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.486
Okay, I'm good.
What's up?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.357
I have this new
lab partner, Simon,

04:16.424 --> 04:18.492
who's one of those
super-cute nerdy guys.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.828
I kind of like him,
but I don't know
what to say to him.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.630
He's into, like,
comic books.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.832
Graphic novels?
Continue.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.167
And, like, those
Chinese cartoon movies.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.937
Japanese anime?
Continue.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.506
See? You speak dork.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.575
Fluently.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.644

with some talking points.

So I'll be the Jedi,
and you'll be my Padawan.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.014

04:41.081 --> 04:42.115
Oh, boy.

some coffee.

you were coming.

about a very exciting plan

05:11.945 --> 05:13.747
to get the city to put in
some speed bumps.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.183
Yeah, we're trying
to commission a traffic
study in Koreatown.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.285
Oh, well, I heard
"Koreans" and "study,"

05:18.352 --> 05:19.420
so I guess that lines up.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.021
(LAUGHS)

05:21.088 --> 05:23.223
Oh, that's funny
because Koreans
are traditionally studious.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.061
Anyway, the city says
they'll listen to our proposal

05:28.128 --> 05:30.030
if we get 1,000 signatures
on our petition.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.066
1,000 signatures?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.268
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of work,

05:35.335 --> 05:36.604
which isn't my jam.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.106
I mean, with all
due respect, this...

too ethnic for me.

covered a lot of stuff.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.412
You never seen
a man press his shirts
in a photo copier before?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.116
Are you okay, Paste?

09:09.182 --> 09:10.718
No, I'm not okay.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.686
I'm a grown man
living in his office.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.622
But I thought you
were enjoying living here.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.290
I was just putting on airs.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.426
You know how
I'm always airs-putting.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.498
You know, last night,
as I lay underneath
a lead x-ray blanket,

09:25.565 --> 09:26.700
I...

09:26.767 --> 09:28.201
I turned to Annie,
and I said,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.303
"This is the loneliest
I've ever been."

09:30.370 --> 09:33.373
Annie?
Yeah, the CPR dummy
I spoon with.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.777
Okay, that is
all kinds of wrong.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.647
Um, listen, Pat,

09:39.713 --> 09:41.314
you got to move
out of that office.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.716
Ah, where would I go?

09:42.783 --> 09:45.619
Some random apartment building
filled with strangers

09:45.686 --> 09:48.856
that will be
a constant reminder
of how empty my life is?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.125
And what if
the Wi-Fi is spotty?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.928
I don't think you realize

09:54.995 --> 09:56.396
how much I need
the Internet right now.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.236
Okay, Pat, um...

10:03.303 --> 10:06.506
You can crash
on my couch
until you find a place.

10:06.573 --> 10:10.243
Well, thank you, Damona,
but I don't need your pity.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.679
Unless, does your
pity come with sex?

10:11.745 --> 10:12.746
Nope.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.183
Then I don't
need your pity.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.419
Oh! Hey, Clark,

10:19.486 --> 10:22.956
didn't you say that
there's a unit open
next to your apartment?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.057
Hmm?

10:27.795 --> 10:28.829
No.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.766
No, you're thinking
of someone else.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.201
Oh, no, no, no.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.938
Remember, we double daydreamed
about being neighbors?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.339
That wasn't me.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.042
Look.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.378
We took a selfie in
the empty living room.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.479
Look.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.381
Let me see that.
Mmm.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.417
Hey, this place
looks terrific.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.085
What's the parking like?
Terrible.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.021
It's street parking only,

10:54.087 --> 10:59.126
and a family
of limousine drivers
lives across the street.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.528
Oh.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.330
But what about
that gated lot,

11:03.396 --> 11:05.132
like, right underneath
the building?
Stop it!

11:06.834 --> 11:08.101
Thanks for the 411.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.803
You know what?
I'm gonna check this out.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.904
Oh, okay.
(CELLPHONE RINGS)

11:10.971 --> 11:13.006
Um, that's my...
Hello?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.375
No, this is Pat.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.044
Well, you'll have
to call her back.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.480
What are you doing?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.549
What? He seemed
so desperate.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.351
Yeah, but the city
is full of places

11:24.417 --> 11:26.286
he could live,
including your building.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.422
Ugh, I would not want
that living next to me.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.992
That would be...

11:32.059 --> 11:33.060
Oh...

11:34.194 --> 11:36.096
Yeah, oh...

11:36.163 --> 11:37.230
Damn it!

11:43.403 --> 11:45.472
Dave, I had lab
with Simon today.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.407
Talk to me, girl.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.843
We were doing an experiment,
and I said it reminded me

11:49.910 --> 11:51.812
of when the guy made
the invisibility potion

11:51.879 --> 11:53.546
in Super Mutant
Magic Academy.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.582
Close enough.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.751
But then Simon
started comparing it
to Harry Potter,

11:57.818 --> 11:58.952
and I got super lost,

11:59.019 --> 12:00.888
so I panicked and faked
a family emergency.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.289
By the way,
if anyone asks,

12:02.355 --> 12:03.356
you're in a coma.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.026
Am I gonna pull through?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.228
No promises.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.131
Okay, it seems we have
to review Harry Potter.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.834
Now, Hogwarts is divided
into four houses.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.168
Gryffindor...

12:15.235 --> 12:17.805
Wait, is that Dad
dancing on a pool table

12:17.871 --> 12:19.907
pretending pool balls
are his breasts?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.308
What?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.043
I was uploading
some pictures for Molly

12:23.110 --> 12:25.712
to the family Photo Stream,
and some of Dad's popped up.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.714
Give me that.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.617
(LAUGHING) Is that
the Korean Men's Club?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.185
Yeah.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.521
This is their last meeting.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.757
Man, doing good deeds
sure makes Dad's face red.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.399
(IMITATING BORAT)
My wife. She good.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.667
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
You remember Borat, right?

12:47.734 --> 12:48.969
Of course.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.971
(IMITATING BORAT)
Very nice.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.673
Okay, that would be funny,
but I just did it.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.608
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I got a surprise for you.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.044
I've been so proud
of the work you're doing

12:57.110 --> 12:58.946
with your group that
I called The Korea Times,

12:59.012 --> 13:01.014
and they're gonna
run a story
about you guys.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.051
What?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.719
Isn't that exciting?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.321
(SQUEALS)

13:08.388 --> 13:09.857
Yeah, I don't think so.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.959
Uh... It's...

13:12.025 --> 13:14.561
We're not about
the awards or accolades.

13:14.627 --> 13:19.599
The true award is
how we feel inside,
privately, to ourselves.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.535
Pshaw!

13:22.602 --> 13:24.304
Stop being so modest.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.538
They're coming
to your next meeting

13:25.605 --> 13:27.040
to learn all about
what you guys do.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.242
(SQUEALING)

13:29.309 --> 13:31.278
Look at you.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.713
You're the new guy,
and you're already
getting them some press.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.548
They're gonna
be so excited.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.750
Yeah, they're gonna
have a big reaction.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.119
That's for dang sure.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.421
(LAUGHS)

13:47.294 --> 13:48.962
How could you
let this happen, Ken?

13:49.029 --> 13:50.397
It'll take
a reporter one minute

13:50.463 --> 13:52.032
to figure out that
we're complete frauds.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.433
What's wrong
with you, man?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.567
I'm sorry, you guys.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.236
I didn't realize my wife
would be proud of me.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.705
The thought never
entered my mind.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.373
Now everyone's
gonna know.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.509
Dude, my wife's
gonna kick my ass.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.445
And we're supposed
to have sex on Tuesday.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.547
What, you have
to schedule your sex?

14:07.614 --> 14:10.183
Lame. (LAUGHS)

14:10.250 --> 14:12.285
I have it every
Thursday I want.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.923
What are we gonna do?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.557
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.992
Maybe we can think
of some good deed

14:19.059 --> 14:20.860
to do while the
reporter interviews us.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.430
Ken, all the projects
we're not really doing

14:23.496 --> 14:24.864
are huge undertakings.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.234
Building a school,
changing laws.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.336
Bringing a WNBA team
to Koreatown.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.570
Hwan, we already voted.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.040
We're not
not doing that.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.774
Well, maybe we can
do something smaller

14:34.841 --> 14:37.877
like go to that
homeless shelter on Third
and dish out soup.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.879
That place closed down.
Remember?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.915
We fake tried to save it.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.051
Now it's all boarded up
and covered in graffiti.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.819
Well, so, we'll paint
over the graffiti

14:46.886 --> 14:48.721
and call it neighborhood
revitalization.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.358
That's actually not bad.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.260
All we'd need is
a couple cans of paint.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.461
Then it's settled.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.562
Great.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.863
Can we start
drinking now?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.566
We just wasted 15 minutes
on that important crap.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.534
(NUTHIN' BUT A "G" THANG
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

15:02.735 --> 15:06.073
Man, you guys really
like this song, huh?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.674
Well, it's dope.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.350
Clark, your building
is to die for.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.752
Oh, you liked it? Yay.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.622
I got to tell you,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.457
after living alone
for so long,

15:24.524 --> 15:27.394
it's gonna be nice
to have a building buddy.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.163
Hey, do you like getting up
at 3:00 A.M. to watch soccer?

15:30.230 --> 15:32.665
No.
Well, you'll get used to it.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.336
Patrick.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.106
Actually, it's Patrice.

15:41.908 --> 15:46.479
Patrice, um,
I value you
as a colleague,

15:46.546 --> 15:48.915
and I think your name is
surprisingly beautiful.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.186
But I also really
value my privacy,

15:53.253 --> 15:55.755
and I would prefer it

15:55.822 --> 15:57.490
if you didn't live
in my building.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.961
Well, Clark...

16:02.029 --> 16:04.131
I totally respect
what you're saying.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.999
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.267
Oh, God.
I'm so relieved.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.335
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

16:08.401 --> 16:09.836
Well, me, too.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.371
Aw, you have no idea
how great it's gonna be

16:11.438 --> 16:13.273
to know I've got an
honest straight-shooter

16:13.340 --> 16:14.607
living right next door.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.577
Well, see you
in the hot tub.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.846
Oh, and fair warning,
I'm a bubbles-off guy.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.781
That's right.
No mysteries.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.657
This blows.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.993
When's this stupid reporter
supposed to show up?

16:34.061 --> 16:36.396
Allison said
it could be anytime
between 1:00 and 6:00.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.997
Well, it better be soon.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.134
If not, we might
have to paint
this whole wall.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.469
You know what,
I got to say,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.904
I actually feel pretty good
about what we're doing.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.040
Yep, this part
of Koreatown

16:47.107 --> 16:49.376
is gonna be a little
whiter and a lot better.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.445
And I did not mean
for that to sound
as horrible as it did.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.117
Excuse me, gentlemen,
what are you doing?

16:57.184 --> 16:58.718
Beautifying
the neighborhood.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.754
Ken Park,
Korean Men's Club,
paying it forward.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.126
Actually, you're
defacing a mural

17:06.193 --> 17:08.961
that was commissioned
as part of this neighborhood's
revitalization effort.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.371
Gary, I thought you called
the city to clear this.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.806
Well, they never
called back.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.508
I don't have time
to wait around all day.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.276
I have a bagel store
to run.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.715
Sorry, guys,
I got to cite you for
defacing public property.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.250
Really?
What are we looking at?

17:30.317 --> 17:32.319
It's going to either
be three hours
of community service

17:32.385 --> 17:33.986
or a $5,000 fine.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.358
We'll take the fine.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.532
Dave, you
squeezable genius!

17:45.598 --> 17:46.633
(GRUNTS)

17:46.699 --> 17:47.834
What happened?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.970
I completely owned
a conversation with Simon,

17:51.037 --> 17:52.439
and now we're going
to the mall,

17:52.505 --> 17:56.276
which, as you know,
is where I really shine.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.146
All right, he might take you
into Gamer's Paradise.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.380
Here's what you
need to know.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.548
No need.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.915
Now that I've got him
nerd-hooked,

18:02.982 --> 18:04.884
it's time to start
my own process.

18:04.951 --> 18:08.188
I'm gonna change
Simon into exactly
the type of boy I want.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.089
Wait, wo this was
all just a game?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.492
You were just using me
to trap this poor sap

18:12.559 --> 18:15.228
into thinking
you're something you're not?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.896
I'm sorry.
I thought that was clear.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.633
That's the way
relationships work, Dave.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.169
You pretend you're
someone you're not

18:22.235 --> 18:24.904
until they fall for you,
and then it's too late.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.640
Wow.
I guess I'm the one
who got the education.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.209
Yeah, whatever.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.510
See you later, Padawan.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.179
I'm the Jedi!

18:37.884 --> 18:39.386
So, how was
your painting thing?

18:39.452 --> 18:40.820
It freaking blew,
Allison.

18:40.887 --> 18:41.921
We painted
over a landmark,

18:41.988 --> 18:43.556
and the police
made us pay a fine.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.625
(CHUCKLING)
The police showed up?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.294
Yeah, but you know
who didn't show up?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.495
That reporter you called.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.563
Aw, that's too bad.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.798
(LAUGHS)

18:51.864 --> 18:53.833
Yeah, I don't know why
this is so funny to you.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.702
Because there is no
reporter, dum-dum.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.836
I made it up.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.738
What?
Why would you do that?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.607
Because you lied to me.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.874
That's right.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.443
I know all about
your fake group.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.313
Well, in my defense,
I was supposed to
do a better job

19:06.379 --> 19:08.715
at keeping it from you.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.784
Do you even know what
"in my defense" means?

19:11.851 --> 19:16.689
Full disclosure,
I'm not super clear on it,
but how'd you find out?

19:16.756 --> 19:19.192
Because all the pictures
on your phone

19:19.259 --> 19:21.194
go to the family
Photo Stream.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.595
By the way,
what's your obsession

19:22.662 --> 19:24.431
with the squirrel
outside your office?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.500
Hey, I've watched
him grow up.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.503
Look, I don't care if you
go drinking with those idiots.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.639
I care that you lied
to me about it.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.274
But all the guys
lie to their wives.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.842
They made me promise.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.777
(CHORTLES) What,
did you spit on your
hands and shake on it?

19:38.945 --> 19:40.413
No.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.881
Again, all your pictures
go to the Photo Stream.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.850
Damn it!

19:43.916 --> 19:46.085
Hey, you're the one who
wanted me to get a hobby.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.387
Yes, I was just
trying to get you

19:47.454 --> 19:49.489
to have more stuff
in your life.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.823
I don't really
need more stuff.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.660
You know, I got my job,
my sweet khakis...

19:55.194 --> 19:56.263
And I got you.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.330
And two kids.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.498
And two kids.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.767
Even still,

20:00.833 --> 20:04.003
it's healthy for both of us
to have other outlets.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.572
Yeah, I know. (SIGHS)

20:05.638 --> 20:08.475
Well, thanks to you,
I did make some new buds,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.310
and we're all going
paintballing Saturday.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.679
There you go.
(CHUCKLES)

20:12.745 --> 20:15.047
Oh, wait.
This Saturday? No.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.917
We're going to Barb Rutledge's
one-week-sober bowling party.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.752
I thought
she was three weeks sober.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.621
I didn't tell you what
happened at the barbecue.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.056
(IMITATES GULPING)

20:25.057 --> 20:26.158
Yeah.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.966
Thank you so much again
for having me over.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.935
Ah, I just wanted
to apologize

20:36.002 --> 20:38.671
for telling Pat
about the apartment
in your building.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.040
It was stupid
and thoughtless of me.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.475
No, I wouldn't say that.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.944
I mean, you were...
You were trying to be nice,

20:45.011 --> 20:47.347
and you didn't think it
all the way through.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.948
Hola, amiga.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.049
Oh, sorry.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.217
Dos amigas.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.553
I brought margaritas.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.954
What are you doing here?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.523
I'm your new neighbor.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.625
Yeah, and it's
Cinco de Mayo
somewhere, right?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.360
No, it's not.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.730
You're living here?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.231
Yeah, Clark tipped
me off to the unit

21:05.298 --> 21:06.866
that was available
down the hall.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.000
And you were right, Clark.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.436
This is much nicer
than your building.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.803
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.673
And it's much closer
to the dog groomers

21:13.740 --> 21:15.608
where I get my nails
and goatee trimmed.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.880
Now, let's talk laundry.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.415
I have a half
load of whites.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.584
Do you mind if I throw
them in with yours?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.419
They are ripe.
