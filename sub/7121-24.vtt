00:35.716 --> 00:36.990
Mmm. Oh, boy.

00:37.051 --> 00:39.622
How much softy cheezy
for your deezy?

00:39.687 --> 00:41.894
A little? A lot?

00:41.956 --> 00:43.629
Blech! None!

00:43.691 --> 00:45.637
But you used to
love softy cheese.

00:45.693 --> 00:47.468
I don't want to talk about it.

00:50.297 --> 00:52.368
- What was that?
- Probably an owl.

00:52.433 --> 00:53.503
Mmm.

00:53.567 --> 00:54.567
Mm-mmm...

00:54.602 --> 00:56.639
A ghost!

00:58.405 --> 01:00.112
Doo, it's just Ghost Princess.

01:00.174 --> 01:01.448
Hey, G. P.!

01:03.177 --> 01:04.587
She's weird, huh?

01:08.916 --> 01:10.259
How's it going?

01:13.721 --> 01:15.325
Are you haunting us?

01:15.389 --> 01:16.732
Yes-s-s.

01:16.790 --> 01:17.790
Oh, okay.

01:20.761 --> 01:22.434
Well, can you knock it off?

01:22.496 --> 01:24.134
Sorry.

01:24.198 --> 01:25.836
It's just I'm doomed

01:25.900 --> 01:28.471
to haunt this mortal plane.

01:28.535 --> 01:31.641
Oh. Let's hear more
about that, honey.

01:31.705 --> 01:34.481
Until I discover the
cause of my death,

01:34.541 --> 01:38.421
my soul can't ascend to
the 50th dead world.

01:38.479 --> 01:41.983
But as a ghost, I have no
memory of my mortal life...

01:42.049 --> 01:45.553
and no idea how I died.

01:46.954 --> 01:48.592
It's a crime case!

01:48.656 --> 01:49.964
Whoa! Step back, nephew!

01:50.024 --> 01:51.970
We don't know that
she was "moidered."

01:52.026 --> 01:53.664
That's right!

01:53.727 --> 01:55.604
We don't even know how
she was "moidered."

01:55.663 --> 01:56.971
But I'm the hard-boiled sleuth

01:57.031 --> 01:59.511
that's gonna crack
your case wide open.

01:59.566 --> 02:03.639
Oh! That sounds wonderful!

02:03.704 --> 02:05.877
This way, gentlemen.

02:09.977 --> 02:12.514
Whoa.

02:12.579 --> 02:14.388
Your neighborhood is... uh...

02:14.448 --> 02:16.121
very peaceful.

02:16.183 --> 02:19.687
It's the cradle of my despair.

02:19.753 --> 02:21.164
Right, right.

02:21.221 --> 02:23.223
Well, here's me.

02:25.626 --> 02:27.697
Our first clue!

02:27.761 --> 02:29.934
"Fee-may-ale."

02:29.997 --> 02:31.943
It's a good start,
but we need more.

02:31.999 --> 02:34.377
Jake, it's time to
interrogate the neighbors.

02:34.435 --> 02:36.472
We'll do it "good
cop, bad cop" -style.

02:36.537 --> 02:37.447
I call "bad cop"!

02:37.504 --> 02:40.610
Aww!

02:40.674 --> 02:42.085
Yo, ghost! Yo, yo!

02:42.142 --> 02:43.143
Yo, wake up, fool!

02:43.210 --> 02:46.350
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo, yo!

02:46.413 --> 02:47.687
What?!

02:47.748 --> 02:49.694
Yo, ghost, what do you
know about the lady

02:49.750 --> 02:52.060
buried next to you?
- What, you mean her?

02:52.119 --> 02:54.292
She's been here longer
than almost everybody!

02:54.355 --> 02:57.097
He's right!

02:57.157 --> 02:59.933
And don't think I don't see
what you do, Ghost Princess.

02:59.994 --> 03:01.029
What?

03:01.095 --> 03:02.199
Sneaking off at night,

03:02.262 --> 03:03.969
scaring peeps, haunting
at all hours...

03:04.031 --> 03:06.875
'cause you can't deal
with your issues!

03:11.438 --> 03:13.281
Leave her be, Boilbee!

03:13.340 --> 03:16.583
Wha-a-a-t?!

03:16.643 --> 03:20.557
A princess deserves empathy...
Not your sass.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.525
Ohhh! Ahh!

03:24.284 --> 03:25.422
Butt out, Clarence.

03:25.486 --> 03:27.523
Some of us still want
to feel, you know...

03:27.588 --> 03:31.400
The vital magnetism of life,

03:31.458 --> 03:33.699
the vibrating
energies that connect

03:33.761 --> 03:36.264
all living and
non-living beings.

03:36.330 --> 03:38.276
Nyah! I don't like your words!

03:38.332 --> 03:39.936
Nyah!

03:40.000 --> 03:41.843
I'm Ghost Princess.

03:41.902 --> 03:44.678
Have we met before? I
feel like we have.

03:44.738 --> 03:48.652
I don't think so, milady,
but I am honor-ed.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.382
What do you know about

03:50.444 --> 03:52.390
Ghosty P's getting
murdle-erdled?

03:52.446 --> 03:54.119
Sorry. I don't know anything.

03:54.181 --> 03:56.320
I can't imagine anyone
who would harm someone

03:56.383 --> 03:59.762
as beautiful as this.

03:59.820 --> 04:01.766
Whoa. Smooth.

04:01.822 --> 04:03.324
Did you try looking yonder?

04:03.390 --> 04:06.269
That's where the néer-do-well
ghosts hang out.

04:06.326 --> 04:09.102
Right. Ne'er-do-wellers.

04:09.163 --> 04:10.699
Let's do this, Jake!

04:10.764 --> 04:14.439
You stay and eat cheese puffs.

04:16.937 --> 04:19.440
Geez. Look at this place.

04:19.505 --> 04:20.951
It's all bunked up.

04:21.007 --> 04:22.968
Yeah, no wonder this is
where the néer-do-wells go

04:23.010 --> 04:24.284
when they deezy.

04:24.344 --> 04:26.017
I got a feeling these
ghosts are gonna be

04:26.080 --> 04:27.582
harder to shake than Boilbee.

04:27.648 --> 04:29.184
Yeah. Well, get ready,

04:29.249 --> 04:31.229
'cause this biz is
gonna get ridonk.

04:31.285 --> 04:33.856
Cool, man! Hey, can
I be "bad cop" now?

04:33.921 --> 04:34.865
No.

04:34.922 --> 04:37.027
Okay. Let's check this guy out.

04:37.091 --> 04:40.504
- What's it say?
- "Some Donkus."

04:40.561 --> 04:43.667
Wake up, Donkus!
We got questions!

04:43.730 --> 04:45.232
Dingus!

04:45.299 --> 04:47.245
Time to sing, ya canary!

04:49.570 --> 04:51.049
Bam! Yah!

04:51.105 --> 04:53.051
What you know about
Ghost Princess, huh?!

04:53.107 --> 04:54.450
Give it up, Dungus!

04:54.508 --> 04:56.419
Hey, man, take it easy.

04:56.477 --> 04:58.718
You do <i>your</i> job, <i>I</i> do <i>mine!</i>

04:58.779 --> 05:01.282
Tell me what you know, punk!

05:01.348 --> 05:03.294
Uh-oh. What's this?

05:03.350 --> 05:05.296
A busted knife.

05:05.352 --> 05:07.298
Is this your knife, bro?

05:07.354 --> 05:09.300
Tell me!

05:09.356 --> 05:10.892
Jake... "good cop"!

05:10.958 --> 05:12.062
Oh, right.

05:12.126 --> 05:13.298
Cool out, "bad cop"!

05:13.360 --> 05:14.395
No! Aah!

05:14.461 --> 05:16.964
This ghost ain't home, man!

05:19.133 --> 05:21.841
Well, you're lucky my
partner's here... pal.

05:21.902 --> 05:23.677
- He's not worth it, man.
- Hmph!

05:23.737 --> 05:25.341
These ghosts think I'm playing.

05:25.405 --> 05:26.850
They think it's all a big game.

05:26.907 --> 05:28.651
But you know what? You
know what I'm gonna do?

05:28.675 --> 05:29.779
What?

05:29.843 --> 05:33.120
I'm gonna turn this
game upside downH

05:34.681 --> 05:37.685
So, you really don't know
how you died, either?

05:37.751 --> 05:39.731
Of course not. Two, please.

05:39.786 --> 05:41.424
And we might never find out.

05:41.488 --> 05:44.264
But that's okay, because
right now, in this moment,

05:44.324 --> 05:46.531
I'm feeling pretty
sweeties, you know?

05:46.593 --> 05:50.439
I feel sweeties also
in this moment, also.

05:50.497 --> 05:52.374
- That's great, Ghost Princess.

05:52.432 --> 05:54.036
I'm glad we can feel
this way together

05:54.101 --> 05:55.705
in the face of uncertainty.

05:55.769 --> 05:58.272
Ladies and gents!

05:58.338 --> 06:02.013
The center for ghost-community
outreach and ghostdatescom

06:02.075 --> 06:04.419
present... Spirit Waves!

06:11.451 --> 06:14.330
More beautiful than
I could imagine.

06:14.388 --> 06:17.494
Are you talking
about Spirit Waves?

06:17.558 --> 06:20.630
I'm talking about you, Princess.

06:20.694 --> 06:23.197
Ya-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

06:23.263 --> 06:27.211
Ghosts! You ghosts!
Come out! Rah!

06:31.872 --> 06:34.011
I think this place
is abandoned, man.

06:34.074 --> 06:37.021
They're just hiding 'cause
they know they're guilty!

06:37.077 --> 06:39.250
Yo! Yo! That's my grave!

06:39.313 --> 06:41.759
Why are you fops
trashing our spot?

06:41.815 --> 06:43.158
We... thought

06:43.217 --> 06:44.321
you were... hiding.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.159
Dude, we were at the
Spirit Waves show.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.995
Kill these fools!

06:49.122 --> 06:51.068
Bring it on, you mamas!

06:51.124 --> 06:53.263
Hold up! These guys are with me.

06:53.327 --> 06:55.773
A'ight, Clarence, but only
because of that one time

06:55.829 --> 06:57.604
when I did that
thing by accident

06:57.664 --> 06:59.109
and you were cool about it.

06:59.166 --> 07:02.272
It's your lucky day, punks.

07:02.336 --> 07:04.282
Whew! Thanks, Clarence!

07:04.338 --> 07:07.080
Yo, I'm sorry we haven't
solved the case yet.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.086
It's all right, Finn.

07:09.142 --> 07:11.349
I'm calling off the
investigation.

07:11.411 --> 07:12.947
What? Why'?

07:13.013 --> 07:16.859
I don't feel tormented anymore
now that I'm with Clarence.

07:16.917 --> 07:19.488
Oh, really? That's...
that's cool.

07:19.553 --> 07:21.191
It's hard to explain,

07:21.255 --> 07:24.202
but it's like we already
know each other.

07:24.258 --> 07:25.703
I feel it, too.

07:25.759 --> 07:29.036
Our spirits must be entwined
in the cosmic wheel of time.

07:29.096 --> 07:30.097
Nice.

07:30.163 --> 07:31.938
Let's go to my
private mausoleum,

07:31.999 --> 07:33.706
where we can be... private.

07:33.767 --> 07:34.871
Yuck.

07:34.935 --> 07:37.176
Thanks for your help!

07:37.237 --> 07:40.411
A'ight!

07:41.441 --> 07:42.385
Aw, man.

07:42.442 --> 07:44.080
I wanted to crack
the case, you know?

07:44.144 --> 07:45.646
Look on the bright side, guy.

07:45.712 --> 07:48.522
We looted all this
sweet grave booty!

07:48.582 --> 07:50.892
Ka-ching!

07:50.951 --> 07:53.693
Jake! You looted?!
That's bad, man!

07:53.754 --> 07:55.597
You're supposed
to be "good cop."

07:55.656 --> 07:57.567
Oops. I didn't
know it was wrong.

07:57.624 --> 07:59.331
Come on. Let's put
all this stuff back.

07:59.393 --> 08:02.340
- What?! All of it?!
- Yes, Jake.

08:02.396 --> 08:03.739
Huh.

08:03.797 --> 08:06.243
This dagger says, "Renee."
- What's that?

08:06.300 --> 08:08.906
I guess Some Donkus'
real name was...

08:08.969 --> 08:11.643
"Re-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-nce!"

08:11.705 --> 08:13.514
Have we met before?

08:13.573 --> 08:15.177
It's hard to explain,

08:15.242 --> 08:18.348
but it's like we already
know each other.

08:18.412 --> 08:20.358
Is this your knife, bro?

08:20.414 --> 08:22.792
This ghost ain't home, man!

08:22.849 --> 08:24.829
What is it, dude?

08:24.885 --> 08:28.025
We got to dig up the princess.

08:31.091 --> 08:33.162
Look! Sorry.

08:33.226 --> 08:34.899
Lookit!

08:34.961 --> 08:38.340
"Clarence." Clarence
was "Some Donkus"!

08:38.398 --> 08:41.004
Some Donkus ski-bopped
Ghost Princess!

08:42.001 --> 08:44.380
Stop!

08:44.438 --> 08:48.045
Clarence is your murdler!

08:56.583 --> 08:59.029
Warrior Princess,
give up your kingdom!

08:59.086 --> 09:02.260
Never... not even
to you, my love!

09:03.924 --> 09:05.528
Unh!

09:05.592 --> 09:08.732
Clarence, I... ahh...

09:08.795 --> 09:10.399
My love!

09:10.464 --> 09:12.410
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

09:18.872 --> 09:20.909
I did it?

09:20.974 --> 09:22.612
I forgive you, Clarence.

09:22.676 --> 09:24.451
Take my hands!

09:24.511 --> 09:27.981
Ascend with me to the
50th dead world!

09:31.852 --> 09:34.128
I can't! My soul is stuck!

09:34.187 --> 09:36.963
I have to know hovv ldied!

09:37.023 --> 09:38.468
Oh, glob!

09:38.525 --> 09:40.596
My life is like a fart.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.606
Whoa, wait a minute.
Say that again.

09:42.662 --> 09:44.573
My life is like a fart!

09:44.631 --> 09:47.441
I know you, man...
From the Squeezy Mart!

09:47.501 --> 09:49.742
Huh? Uh, Squeezy Mart?

09:49.803 --> 09:52.249
I'm starting to remember.

09:52.305 --> 09:53.750
I was a broken man.

09:57.978 --> 09:58.922
More.

09:58.979 --> 10:00.219
I think you've had enough, man.

10:00.247 --> 10:02.750
I don't care. My
life is like a fart.

10:02.816 --> 10:05.422
Huh?

10:05.485 --> 10:07.556
My life is like a fart!

10:08.622 --> 10:10.465
Hey! Hey, stop that!

10:10.524 --> 10:12.800
Citizen's arrest!

10:14.895 --> 10:16.272
Hey, be careful, man!

10:21.368 --> 10:23.974
So, that's why you don't
like softy cheese.

10:24.037 --> 10:26.483
Clarence!

10:26.540 --> 10:29.180
Ghost Princess!

10:36.149 --> 10:37.787
Congratulations, you kids!

10:37.851 --> 10:39.194
Yeah!

10:39.252 --> 10:40.754
- Goodbye!
- Thanks for everything!

10:40.821 --> 10:42.266
- Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.
