WEBVTT

00:05.681 --> 00:09.449
You know, sometimes one little negative
can trump a dozen positives.

00:09.485 --> 00:11.410
Case in point, my life.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.571
Everything should be great.

00:15.596 --> 00:17.455
Cool new job as S.H.I.E.L.D.
Student Instructor.

00:17.502 --> 00:20.267
Nova and Nick Fury are apparently
out on some secret mission.

00:20.292 --> 00:22.127
So no one's here busting my chops.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.278
And when Doc and Hydra teamed
up and attacked S.H.I.E.L.D.,

00:24.336 --> 00:26.235
we kicked his metal cephalopod butt.

00:27.925 --> 00:30.901
Looks like the rebuilding of the
Triskelion's going full force.

00:30.926 --> 00:32.141
Good work, guys.

00:35.349 --> 00:38.462
My old science pal, Dr. Connors, is
running S.H.I.E.L.D. with Fury gone.

00:38.487 --> 00:40.034
Good to have friends in high places.

00:40.059 --> 00:41.733
And then there's the Web-Warriors.

00:41.851 --> 00:44.948
They're more than just my new team.
They're all Spiders.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.077
What's making me such a webby downer?

00:49.149 --> 00:50.834
I kinda got some bad news.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.539
<i>Someone at S.H.I.E.L.D.,
not a Spider, is a spy for Ock.</i>

00:54.655 --> 00:56.915
<i>It's up to the Web-Warriors
to smoke them out.</i>

00:56.940 --> 00:58.902
Welcome, academy students.

00:58.927 --> 01:02.647
Today, we've got some upgrades
that will certainly blow you away.

01:02.672 --> 01:04.036
Not literally, we hope.

01:04.061 --> 01:08.008
Yes. You will be
figuratively blown away.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.498
Quite figuratively.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.200
Oh. And did I forget to mention
Agents Fitz and Simmons,

01:12.225 --> 01:14.178
two of the greatest S.H.I.E.L.D.
techs of all time,

01:14.203 --> 01:16.265
are helping upgrade the Triskelion?

01:16.694 --> 01:18.389
<i>Commence training program.</i>

01:18.414 --> 01:20.994
<i>Me and the Web-Warriors
intend to use every chance we get</i>

01:21.019 --> 01:23.855
<i>to interrogate our fellow
agents and find the traitor.</i>

01:30.471 --> 01:32.969
So, Power Man, what I
hear you not saying

01:32.994 --> 01:34.395
is that you wouldn't not
do something illegal

01:34.420 --> 01:36.125
if you couldn't not get away with it?

01:36.150 --> 01:38.211
Is that English coming
out of your mouth?

01:40.460 --> 01:44.398
How would you handle betraying everyone
you ever cared about, Iron Fist?

01:44.830 --> 01:46.838
- Hypothetically.
- I don't have a clue.

01:46.863 --> 01:49.606
My heart would be incapable
of such betrayal.

01:49.829 --> 01:50.733
Gah!

01:55.228 --> 01:57.788
You must have a lot
of aquatic friends, Triton.

01:57.813 --> 02:00.785
Any octopus buddies
we should know about?

02:00.837 --> 02:01.639
Huh?

02:02.665 --> 02:05.646
Looking mighty guilty there,
little mister.

02:05.671 --> 02:07.325
What are you hiding?

02:08.133 --> 02:10.448
Ugh! I deserved that.

02:11.906 --> 02:15.204
Okay. So when it comes to interrogation,
we're no Black Widow.

02:15.229 --> 02:17.001
End session. Whoa!

02:18.143 --> 02:21.399
Very good. That was
a successful first test.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.941
Isn't this test over?

02:28.398 --> 02:29.734
Someone tell this guy.

02:30.552 --> 02:32.620
Look out! The fail-safes are off.

02:32.645 --> 02:35.326
That bot, it's using lethal force.

02:39.684 --> 02:43.867
Lethal force? Why can't these things
ever malfunction into giving hugs?

02:58.908 --> 03:01.620
Can't say I'm really into this
new training regimen.

03:03.025 --> 03:04.992
Hang on, Spidey. We're coming.

03:05.017 --> 03:07.452
Why don't stop not trying
not to save him?

03:08.380 --> 03:11.299
Guys, less bumper cars, more saving.

03:12.939 --> 03:14.448
This thing is tough.

03:14.587 --> 03:16.588
Can't hold...

03:21.571 --> 03:23.109
Nice work, bro.

03:23.145 --> 03:25.217
Any time, my bro.

03:25.242 --> 03:27.367
Sorry, everyone. So sorry.

03:27.392 --> 03:29.667
These wee little glitches
are very rare.

03:29.692 --> 03:32.040
"Wee glitches"? Oh, I get it.

03:32.151 --> 03:34.494
- Understatement.
- I don't know how that happened.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.487
I'm just glad you're okay.

03:37.932 --> 03:39.491
That thing went right for you.

03:39.516 --> 03:42.091
As if it had
been reprogrammed to attack.

03:42.116 --> 03:43.292
Intentionally.

03:43.482 --> 03:48.463
- Wait. I'm totally lost.
- He means sabotaged.

03:48.488 --> 03:51.620
- By Doc Ock's spy.
- Right. I knew that.

03:51.645 --> 03:54.207
Let's not jump to conclusions
before we have some answers.

03:54.232 --> 03:56.495
You three, find out what
you can from the others.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.820
You're with me. I have an idea.

04:02.587 --> 04:05.204
That's not a bomb just sitting
on the table, is it?

04:05.229 --> 04:08.111
Obviously, it's a prototype
high-yield aerosol dispersal unit.

04:08.136 --> 04:11.529
Obviously that could come in handy next
time Hulk uses the S.H.I.E.L.D. bathroom.

04:11.554 --> 04:13.493
It's meant to deliver tranquilizer gas.

04:13.518 --> 04:16.084
Could knock out an entire
building with one small vial.

04:16.108 --> 04:19.293
So, today's malfunction, it's, um,

04:19.319 --> 04:21.726
not possible that
it wasn't not an accident.

04:21.752 --> 04:23.647
If you're worried about
sabotage, you can forget it.

04:23.672 --> 04:25.374
You actually understood
what he just said?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.438
These bots came straight
from the S.H.I.E.L.D. factory,

04:27.463 --> 04:30.219
then moved directly to the training
area by your own students

04:30.244 --> 04:31.744
and calibrated on-site.

04:31.769 --> 04:33.761
Could the bot have been
reprogrammed here?

04:33.786 --> 04:35.409
Not likely. We examined the remains,

04:35.434 --> 04:37.797
but its central processor was
destroyed by Rhino's attack.

04:37.822 --> 04:41.074
Hiccups like this are bound to
happen in upgrading the Triskelion.

04:41.099 --> 04:43.515
You said the bot was calibrated here?
By who?

04:43.540 --> 04:46.280
- By your own Dr. Connors.
- Dr. Connors?

04:46.337 --> 04:49.595
Don't worry. S.H.I.E.L.D. averages
one equipment malfunction a year.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.868
So you won't have to worry
about another one until...

04:51.893 --> 04:53.096
- Whoa!
- Ahhh!

04:53.121 --> 04:56.453
Looks like we're going to have
to recalculate those averages!

04:57.835 --> 05:00.192
And I thought the new
training routine was bad.

05:01.269 --> 05:02.917
You think this is a coincidence?

05:04.066 --> 05:06.593
- Highly suspicious.
- Abandon lab!

05:09.438 --> 05:11.965
Looks like your guys' mission
went smoothly.

05:12.663 --> 05:14.038
- Any luck?
- Nada.

05:14.063 --> 05:17.813
If the spy was involved in that attack,
he really covered his tracks.

05:17.838 --> 05:21.452
We just learned Dr. Curt Connors
was the last one to handle that bot.

05:21.524 --> 05:24.923
Let's not forget, Connors
was also once the Lizard.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.449
That's ancient history.

05:26.474 --> 05:29.363
I know what you're all thinking,
but the spy is not Connors.

05:29.388 --> 05:30.991
I trust that man with my life.

05:31.263 --> 05:34.870
Listen. I know how hard it is
to fight the evil inside.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.785
I do it every day.

05:37.071 --> 05:40.114
Maybe he... lost.

05:40.398 --> 05:43.281
Easy solve. Lock him
in solitary confinement

05:43.306 --> 05:46.074
for a few weeks and see
if the attacks stop.

05:46.099 --> 05:48.199
We can't throw
people in jail without evidence.

05:48.419 --> 05:50.207
And we won't give in to paranoia.

05:50.232 --> 05:52.372
Dr. Connors isn't the spy.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.988
We may not know who it is,

05:54.148 --> 05:56.578
but we do know who
the mole's working for.

05:56.984 --> 06:00.395
- Doc Ock.
- Agent Venom, go and guard the cellblock.

06:00.523 --> 06:03.757
Yes, sir, Spidey, sir.
You can count on me.

06:05.507 --> 06:07.539
Maybe you should take
your buddy Rhino, too.

06:07.564 --> 06:09.591
For, um, you know, extra muscle.

06:11.937 --> 06:13.912
The rest of us are heading
to Doc Connors' lab.

06:14.756 --> 06:17.006
Oh, yeah. Interrogation time.

06:17.031 --> 06:18.868
Nobody's interrogating anyone.

06:19.094 --> 06:22.441
We need to ask someone with authority,
someone we trust, to help us.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.909
Hey, Doc, we could really use...

06:35.963 --> 06:37.030
A hand?

06:37.799 --> 06:38.623
Ah!

06:45.036 --> 06:47.947
Sorry, Spider-Man.

06:48.044 --> 06:49.037
I...

06:54.698 --> 06:57.143
Dr. Connors! What have you done?

07:00.895 --> 07:03.735
Uh, let's talk this out,
Spider to Lizard!

07:05.343 --> 07:06.797
Everyone scatter!

07:10.441 --> 07:13.760
Whoa, Doc Connors! I just told everyone
you weren't the Lizard anymore.

07:13.776 --> 07:15.189
You're making me look bad.

07:22.483 --> 07:25.336
Told you. Connors was the spy.

07:25.458 --> 07:28.093
Finally, something I can slash.

07:31.863 --> 07:34.011
Iron Spider, alert the academy.

07:36.995 --> 07:38.265
Whoa!

07:41.672 --> 07:43.555
Where is it? Where is it?

07:46.836 --> 07:49.592
Robo-kid, grab the legs and tail.

07:49.628 --> 07:52.974
Sure. Give me the easy part.

08:01.807 --> 08:03.226
That wasn't so hard.

08:03.251 --> 08:04.898
Careful!
He can extend his...

08:05.877 --> 08:06.759
Ow!

08:10.449 --> 08:11.843
That really hurt.

08:14.855 --> 08:17.044
Spidey, why aren't you helping?

08:17.202 --> 08:20.030
Dr. Connors always keeps
a supply of the cure in his lab.

08:20.055 --> 08:21.089
For moments like...

08:22.155 --> 08:23.214
Bingo!

08:27.459 --> 08:29.767
No! They're all smashed!

08:31.311 --> 08:33.143
A bit overdramatic, don't you think?

08:33.217 --> 08:35.006
It couldn't have hurt that much.

08:36.518 --> 08:38.505
The Lizard's bite is contagious?

08:38.530 --> 08:40.890
My research indicates
nothing about infections.

08:42.375 --> 08:46.240
- Time to update your research, Cho.
- He's right. This is new.

09:07.617 --> 09:08.602
Ahhh!

09:15.284 --> 09:16.321
Ahhh!

09:17.416 --> 09:20.349
We're gonna be outnumbered
in about 2.17 seconds.

09:22.393 --> 09:24.756
"Outnumbered" is my least
favorite kind of "numbered."

09:32.907 --> 09:34.845
Do not go in there!

09:34.870 --> 09:37.037
What? Hulk use the bathroom again?

09:37.062 --> 09:41.029
Dr. Connors bit Miles, who bit Scarlet.
Now they're all lizards.

09:42.492 --> 09:44.775
Don't hurt them.
They're still our friends.

09:52.472 --> 09:54.685
New strategy, retreat!

09:59.140 --> 10:00.933
Go! We'll hold them off.

10:18.099 --> 10:19.558
That'll buy us some time.

10:19.584 --> 10:22.344
Not enough. I did a quick
mental calculation.

10:22.369 --> 10:26.968
At the rate this lizard virus spreads,
New York will be overrun in 23.6 hours,

10:26.993 --> 10:29.435
and the rest of the world
in 3.3 weeks!

10:29.460 --> 10:31.433
- You did that in your head?
- Focus.

10:31.482 --> 10:33.346
- We need a plan.
- Okay.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.213
First priority, prevent the
lizard virus from getting out.

10:36.238 --> 10:38.504
Power Man, get the others
and secure the perimeter.

10:38.529 --> 10:40.348
Group up in pairs at each exit,

10:40.373 --> 10:42.401
garage, lobby, loading dock.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.936
Why pairs? That's not as efficient.

10:44.961 --> 10:47.888
Because whoever the spy is, I don't
want them to be able to work alone.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.194
Connors is the spy! Are you nuts?

10:50.219 --> 10:52.606
Possibly, because I still
don't believe that.

10:52.631 --> 10:55.214
They'll never break through.
Those doors have the strength of...

10:57.592 --> 11:00.815
You weren't factoring in Iron Fist
Lizard into your equation, were you?

11:00.951 --> 11:03.355
We need to find a way
to revert them back, now.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.403
But how? The cure was destroyed.

11:05.428 --> 11:08.237
Not all of it.
There's still one backup supply.

11:08.385 --> 11:09.853
But it's kept in the most dangerous,

11:09.878 --> 11:12.440
most high-security place
in the entire Triskelion.

11:12.465 --> 11:14.267
The weapons vault?
Detention block?

11:14.292 --> 11:16.890
Worse. Nick Fury's office.

11:31.251 --> 11:33.587
Cloak? You're supposed to be
guarding the exits.

11:33.612 --> 11:36.713
I saw you were in trouble
on the security cams. I came to help.

11:38.909 --> 11:39.885
Ahhh!

11:43.428 --> 11:47.131
Thank you, uh, weird
teleporting Lizard Cloak.

11:47.241 --> 11:50.160
Don't worry. That'll come
back to bite us, I'm sure.

11:50.421 --> 11:52.629
See if you can get Fury's door unlocked.

11:53.405 --> 11:56.687
Not gonna be easy. Fury's office
is layered with defenses.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.133
Um, you can go first.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.630
Gee, thanks.

12:08.008 --> 12:11.848
Okay. Fury couldn't possibly have
booby-trapped everything in here.

12:14.281 --> 12:15.011
Whoa!

12:20.860 --> 12:23.183
Fury wouldn't make it
easy to find the cure.

12:23.219 --> 12:24.741
You think this is easy?

12:29.444 --> 12:31.908
Face it. Connors must be the mole.

12:31.943 --> 12:33.604
That cure was smashed.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.557
He did it so the virus would spread.

12:36.254 --> 12:37.554
Good find, Cho.

12:37.926 --> 12:40.088
Look, you don't know Connors like I do.

12:40.113 --> 12:42.469
Nothing would make him want
to become the Lizard again.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.158
Uh-oh. There's only one vial!

12:50.571 --> 12:51.323
Huh?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.549
Abandon office!

13:00.629 --> 13:02.965
- Uh, is that...
- Triton.

13:02.990 --> 13:07.302
The lizard virus must be interacting
even more powerfully with his Inhuman DNA.

13:09.290 --> 13:11.644
Giant Inhuman lizard? Great.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.886
The cure! No!

13:22.386 --> 13:23.946
We can't lose that cure!

13:33.360 --> 13:35.541
You've got to be more careful
with this thing, Webs.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.079
Power Man, get out of here!

13:37.104 --> 13:39.258
Triton's like three lizards
rolled into one!

13:39.283 --> 13:41.798
Did you forget my skin's unbreakable?

13:41.823 --> 13:45.047
There's no one better prepared to
fight this lizard outbreak than me.

13:52.939 --> 13:54.538
So, that happened.

14:01.118 --> 14:04.243
Taser webs? That won't hurt him.
It'll just make him mad.

14:04.268 --> 14:06.541
That's my point. Get ready to duck!

14:10.388 --> 14:12.971
Remind me to clean that up
before Fury gets home.

14:17.402 --> 14:19.150
We gotta get to Fitz-Simmons' lab.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.358
We need to make enough
of this cure to save everyone.

14:28.845 --> 14:30.239
Psst! Down here.

14:30.821 --> 14:34.372
Fitz and Simmons. Man, are we glad
to see your non-lizardized faces.

14:36.165 --> 14:38.317
You know, "lizardize"
is not a real word.

14:38.487 --> 14:39.998
Not the time, Cho.

14:40.384 --> 14:42.324
I only have one vial of the cure.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.588
Please tell me you have
a chemical synthesizer.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.870
What? Do you think we're amateurs?
Of course we do.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.830
Yeah! Knock-out missiles!

14:58.865 --> 15:01.138
Venom and Rhino! What a team!

15:01.862 --> 15:02.654
Huh?

15:03.871 --> 15:04.959
You hearing that?

15:12.274 --> 15:13.530
The squirrels?

15:13.555 --> 15:16.537
I'm sorry I made you puke up
your acorns, Monkey Joe.

15:16.868 --> 15:18.317
No hard feelings?

15:18.342 --> 15:20.319
I think that's Mr. Lieberman.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.796
They're just tiny things.
We can stop them.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.215
Or not.

15:35.711 --> 15:38.363
I always suspected those guys
would turn on us.

15:42.568 --> 15:43.871
Whoa!

15:46.429 --> 15:48.497
I'll get the vent! Seal the door!

15:52.119 --> 15:53.576
Won't hold long.

15:54.111 --> 15:55.361
Then let's do this.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.295
Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Sorry. Sorry.

16:05.786 --> 16:08.733
It's working! Analyzing
chemical composition.

16:18.326 --> 16:19.201
Oh, no.

16:19.226 --> 16:20.668
Spider-Man!

16:21.107 --> 16:23.508
You were right. Came back to bite us.

16:32.101 --> 16:35.003
Fitz! Simmons! No!

16:39.918 --> 16:41.075
The cure!

16:45.762 --> 16:46.743
Got it!

16:50.665 --> 16:53.247
<i>Warning.
Power level at 20%.</i>

16:53.272 --> 16:56.465
Cho, you're using up all your
suit's power. What are you doing?

16:56.493 --> 17:00.057
Buying you time. I'm gonna channel
the last of my suit's energy

17:00.082 --> 17:01.919
to set off a conductive pulse.

17:02.737 --> 17:05.963
Too low for humans to hear
but painful to reptilians.

17:05.988 --> 17:07.542
Like a lizard EMP?

17:08.221 --> 17:10.208
Great, but the synthesizer's destroyed.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.433
I've got nothing left!
End of plan!

17:13.627 --> 17:15.758
<i>Power zero. Deactivating.</i>

17:17.159 --> 17:20.509
I don't trust Connors, but I
do trust you to figure it out.

17:21.839 --> 17:22.998
Cho!

17:32.564 --> 17:35.006
Trust me? To do what?

17:35.071 --> 17:38.278
How do I cure everyone with one vial?

17:54.535 --> 17:57.747
I just want to say, it's an
honor to fight with you, Alex.

17:57.772 --> 18:00.417
I know we weren't best of friends
or anything in high school.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.699
And I'm glad we,
you know, got past that.

18:05.130 --> 18:06.076
Huh?

18:07.046 --> 18:10.363
Why are you getting all sappy?
We're gonna survive this.

18:19.374 --> 18:21.076
The aerosol dispersal unit!

18:22.413 --> 18:25.586
Fitz said you could knock out a whole
building with a single vial of gas.

18:25.622 --> 18:26.992
Or was it Simmons?

18:28.692 --> 18:30.287
The ventilation system!

18:31.895 --> 18:33.745
All I gotta do is pop this in, and...

18:35.415 --> 18:36.454
Seriously?

18:43.816 --> 18:45.845
Come on! Stay in!

18:46.855 --> 18:50.066
Oh, good, because there wasn't
already enough pressure on me.

18:51.379 --> 18:54.867
Dr. Connors! Curt! It's me, Spider-Man.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.155
I know there's still humanity in you.

18:57.462 --> 18:59.920
There's got to be. I'm your friend.

18:59.945 --> 19:02.991
These are your friends.
Help me save them.

19:03.290 --> 19:05.768
I know you're in there, Curt.
I trust you.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.425
Hurry.

19:10.579 --> 19:11.453
Thanks.

19:34.110 --> 19:34.718
Huh?

19:36.219 --> 19:39.522
Welcome back, Monkey Joe.
I never really doubted you.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.240
Where does he keep those things?

19:50.162 --> 19:52.243
Gotcha! Thanks for not biting me.

19:52.388 --> 19:54.956
Thank you for trusting me.

19:58.636 --> 20:00.472
My skin feels like sandpaper.

20:00.497 --> 20:03.326
Ugh! My mouth tastes
like sandpaper.

20:03.687 --> 20:05.336
Only lasts a week.

20:07.882 --> 20:11.961
Safe to say, Web-Warriors
plus reptile equals bad mojo.

20:11.986 --> 20:14.001
But why did you do it, Connors?

20:14.026 --> 20:15.869
Why turn into the Lizard again?

20:16.939 --> 20:20.931
- Wasn't me. It was...
<i>- Mayday! SOS! Red alert!</i>

20:20.956 --> 20:24.365
<i>Spider-Man, I need your help!
We're friends! Don't do this!</i>

20:24.390 --> 20:26.573
Oh, boy. Back to work, team.

20:28.018 --> 20:28.992
Venom!

20:31.596 --> 20:32.656
Doc Ock?

20:34.291 --> 20:36.792
Gone.
And no sign of Agent Venom.

20:36.817 --> 20:38.742
The prison walls are bashed in,

20:38.797 --> 20:41.915
- like by an enormous...
- Rhino.

20:41.957 --> 20:43.628
He betrayed us.

20:43.832 --> 20:45.795
He was the spy all along?

20:45.820 --> 20:49.251
Rhino was the one who injected me.

20:49.276 --> 20:52.920
So he smashed your lab
and the vials of lizard cure.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.586
He must have.

20:56.042 --> 20:58.451
But I don't exactly remember that part.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.134
Search the Triskelion.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.823
Ock cannot have gotten far.

21:05.559 --> 21:08.364
He has Agent Venom.
Where's he taking him?

21:10.652 --> 21:12.790
Hydra. Gotta be.

21:13.246 --> 21:17.454
We were wrong to
doubt you, Spidey. We're sorry.

21:17.523 --> 21:19.004
And it won't happen again.

21:19.218 --> 21:21.627
Good. I'm counting on that trust.

21:21.890 --> 21:25.042
I'm gonna need it. We've had our
backs to the wall for too long.

21:25.257 --> 21:27.892
It's time we take the battle
to Doc Ock and Hydra.

21:28.171 --> 21:29.381
And we're not returning

21:29.406 --> 21:31.360
until we have Agent Venom back.
