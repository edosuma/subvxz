[loud clatter]

00:09.467 --> 00:11.307
You don't talk that way
in my house!

00:11.355 --> 00:12.810
- Get the fuck off me!
- Leslie, stop it!

00:12.858 --> 00:15.650
- You have no respect!
- [shouting]

00:20.259 --> 00:21.728
Look.

00:22.381 --> 00:25.149
I work my tail off
for this family.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.247
You guys know it.

00:28.252 --> 00:30.949
Because I love you.

00:30.954 --> 00:33.785
I love you guys.

00:33.790 --> 00:35.559
You know it.

00:36.326 --> 00:38.323
We love you, too, Dad.

00:38.328 --> 00:40.859
Just stop doing
cocaine all the time.

00:40.864 --> 00:42.766
Act like a man.

00:53.543 --> 00:54.939
What's going on here?

00:54.944 --> 00:56.575
Leslie, can we talk?

00:56.580 --> 00:59.048
What's going on here?
This is my company.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.480
What's the issue here?

01:01.485 --> 01:04.248
Leslie, these gentlemen
want to talk to you.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.922
Ahem.

01:07.624 --> 01:12.261
The closest feeling to that
of cocaine is, uh...

01:13.162 --> 01:14.893
is winning or...

01:14.898 --> 01:18.101
acquiring a large
sum of money...

01:19.403 --> 01:21.733
such as in a, uh...

01:21.738 --> 01:25.541
a lottery or an inheritance.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.613
And... And good cocaine...

01:30.847 --> 01:36.786
is like pure concentrated cool.

01:38.322 --> 01:42.387
You become an expert...
Joe Cool...

01:42.392 --> 01:44.989
on all topics,

01:44.994 --> 01:49.165
and you want to pass all
your knowledge on right now.

01:52.201 --> 01:55.300
And the universe glows,

01:55.305 --> 01:57.736
and rooms...

01:57.741 --> 02:00.744
take on lovely concavities.

02:04.514 --> 02:06.282
I recall once...

02:08.884 --> 02:12.689
after using cocaine
in the office place...

02:14.491 --> 02:17.856
that my...
my thirtysomething secretary,

02:17.861 --> 02:22.766
who I had not looked too
closely at previously...

02:24.233 --> 02:26.102
was really...

02:27.070 --> 02:28.872
quite beautiful.

02:30.707 --> 02:33.276
And she was very kind to me.

02:34.611 --> 02:36.880
She had a lovely smile.

02:39.516 --> 02:42.351
And her breasts
were quite splendid.

02:46.222 --> 02:50.689
This appetite for cocaine

02:50.694 --> 02:53.763
has led to costly indiscretions.

02:55.665 --> 02:57.734
I'm standing trial...

02:59.403 --> 03:01.065
for embezzlement
from the company

03:01.070 --> 03:05.308
that I formed when I was 24.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.078
My family...

03:10.514 --> 03:12.949
no longer speaks to me.

03:18.087 --> 03:20.284
This morning I...

03:20.289 --> 03:22.158
I sat in a park...

03:23.493 --> 03:26.958
where I spent the better
moments of my life...

03:26.963 --> 03:32.001
with my then-small
half-Vietnamese son...

03:34.337 --> 03:38.703
and I watched a young boy...

03:38.708 --> 03:43.508
engineer and then
single-handedly build

03:43.513 --> 03:46.215
a splendid sand castle.

03:48.084 --> 03:50.749
And then he rose

03:50.754 --> 03:55.353
and gleefully stomped it
back once more

03:55.358 --> 03:58.194
simply into grains of sand.

03:59.395 --> 04:01.460
Why do we do this?

04:01.465 --> 04:03.762
I'm Leslie Claret,

04:03.767 --> 04:07.436
and I can't stop doing
something that's harming me.

04:09.138 --> 04:11.803
Help me. Please?

04:11.808 --> 04:14.105
Man on PA:
Lockdown in five.

04:14.110 --> 04:15.574
Lockdown in five.

04:15.579 --> 04:18.610
Well, the steps give you order,

04:18.615 --> 04:20.812
and that gives you clarity,

04:20.817 --> 04:23.047
and out of the clarity

04:23.052 --> 04:24.849
you find purpose.

04:24.854 --> 04:27.356
That's the long and short of it.

04:29.058 --> 04:31.456
Man:
Leslie, listen.

04:31.461 --> 04:33.858
We've known each other
a long time.

04:33.863 --> 04:36.060
You were a legendary influence

04:36.065 --> 04:38.797
in the modern age
of industrial piping.

04:38.802 --> 04:42.233
You're welcome here at McMillan.

04:42.238 --> 04:46.505
We're honored to have you
here at McMillan.

04:46.510 --> 04:51.476
But, Leslie, I'm afraid
there'll be a ceiling

04:51.481 --> 04:55.213
for you, for good, Leslie,

04:55.218 --> 04:56.915
at McMillan.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.951
My mother-in-law holds you
in the highest regard,

04:59.956 --> 05:03.855
but she has a responsibility
to our shareholders.

05:03.860 --> 05:06.558
It's impossible,
because of your conviction,

05:06.563 --> 05:10.834
to offer you a position
greater than divisional.

05:13.302 --> 05:16.205
Hey, let's get to work.

05:16.906 --> 05:19.504
When do you
want to start? June?

05:19.509 --> 05:23.341
I'd rather start sooner
than later, though,

05:23.346 --> 05:25.409
just to get back in the swing.

05:25.414 --> 05:26.945
Let's say June,

05:26.950 --> 05:29.614
start of the third quarter.

05:29.619 --> 05:31.550

right in there,

the Denon presentation.

Hello.
I'm Eugene Chow.

07:52.862 --> 07:55.459
I'm a process engineer.

07:55.464 --> 07:57.796
I'm sorry.
His name's not Eugene.

07:57.801 --> 07:59.330
Uh, that's cool.
I don't even work here.

07:59.335 --> 08:01.704
I'm just visiting my girlfriend.

08:02.806 --> 08:05.241
Big step back for you, Stephen.

08:11.414 --> 08:12.643
Well, that was embarrassing

08:12.648 --> 08:14.112
for both of us there, Stephen.

08:14.117 --> 08:15.714
I'm sorry.

08:15.719 --> 08:18.316
That's okay.
I'm just, uh...

08:18.321 --> 08:20.651
running out of ideas, you know?

08:20.656 --> 08:23.092
You should write it
on your hand, too.

08:42.678 --> 08:44.442
Ready for the Denon?

08:44.447 --> 08:46.377
Leslie, yeah. Hey.

08:50.119 --> 08:51.716
Sounds good.

08:51.721 --> 08:55.019
Great. Hey, let's
try to get back

08:55.024 --> 08:57.188
on the right track
here, me and you.

08:57.193 --> 08:58.256
Let's do it.

08:58.261 --> 09:02.765
All right. Good luck.
See you at 2.

09:07.470 --> 09:08.767
We've made things difficult

09:08.772 --> 09:10.468
for your European detective.

09:10.473 --> 09:13.542
I'm gonna do more along
those lines this afternoon.

09:14.477 --> 09:16.307
Carlson.

09:16.312 --> 09:19.243
- Thank you.
- Tom, get out of here.

09:19.248 --> 09:22.785
Come on. How many times
have we done this?

09:25.288 --> 09:26.717
Oh, that's game.

09:26.722 --> 09:29.453
Looks like maybe
you lost a step.

09:29.458 --> 09:30.755
Let's go again.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.123
We'll see who's lost something,

09:32.128 --> 09:34.797
- you son of a bitch.
- [chuckling]

10:11.134 --> 10:13.998
Carlson, are you pretending
to still be in shape?

10:14.003 --> 10:16.100
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, me, too.

10:16.105 --> 10:18.002
You want to say
the next point wins

10:18.007 --> 10:20.338
before one of us has a stroke?

10:20.343 --> 10:21.610
Oh, yeah.

10:22.511 --> 10:23.779
[grunt]

10:27.283 --> 10:29.047
Good game.

10:29.052 --> 10:31.249
Carlson, thanks again
for your help with this.

10:31.254 --> 10:33.084
Tom, come on.
It's the way it works.

10:33.089 --> 10:34.485
We'll slow her down.

10:34.490 --> 10:35.887
Take care of yourself.

10:35.892 --> 10:37.493
I always do.

10:40.363 --> 10:41.697

12:22.231 --> 12:23.466
Aah!

12:53.129 --> 12:54.725
Man: I work here.
What do you do?

12:54.730 --> 12:55.793
Man: Me? Hey...

12:55.798 --> 12:57.028
I'm required to have

12:57.033 --> 12:58.529
a local access writ now.

12:58.534 --> 13:00.898
The INTERPOL Orange
Writ of Coaction.

13:00.903 --> 13:02.766
Well, we prepared
the Orange Writ.

13:02.771 --> 13:04.168
We didn't send it, though,

13:04.173 --> 13:07.476
as your Blue Notice for
federal access was denied.

13:08.677 --> 13:10.174
Oh.

13:10.179 --> 13:13.544
Okay. Well, now I can
mail the writ to you.

13:13.549 --> 13:15.713
Possibly can you
just hand it to me?

13:15.718 --> 13:17.982
My flight leaves for Milwaukee
in an hour and a half.

13:17.987 --> 13:19.583
Well, see, it's in the mailroom.

13:19.588 --> 13:21.752
We'll never find it.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.787
Is the Orange Writ orange?

13:23.792 --> 13:25.256
It is.

13:25.261 --> 13:26.890
That will probably
make it easier.

13:26.895 --> 13:28.431
Probably.

13:31.467 --> 13:32.530
[sigh]

13:32.535 --> 13:33.764
Is that it?

13:33.769 --> 13:36.800
That is probably it, yes.

13:36.805 --> 13:38.069
I'll be frank with you.

13:38.074 --> 13:40.171
Carlson Sohns,
who runs INTERPOL U.S.,

13:40.176 --> 13:41.805
said "Let it get buried
in the mailroom."

13:41.810 --> 13:43.941
We delay like that all the time

13:43.946 --> 13:45.576
when we're awfully busy.

13:45.581 --> 13:47.711
I don't think
he expected for you

13:47.716 --> 13:48.879
to get your Blue Notice.

13:48.884 --> 13:50.314
Yeah. Thanks. You showed me.

13:50.319 --> 13:53.084
So I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to do now.

13:53.089 --> 13:55.319
I called Carlson.
They said he went out

13:55.324 --> 13:57.021
to play racquetball
five hours ago

13:57.026 --> 13:59.057
and never came back.

13:59.062 --> 14:01.159
I don't want to piss off my boss

14:01.164 --> 14:03.394
by handing you something
he wanted me to mail later.

14:03.399 --> 14:06.264
And I don't want
to piss off my boss

14:06.269 --> 14:08.971
by not catching someone
who murdered someone.

14:12.441 --> 14:13.909
Rochambeau?

14:39.602 --> 14:41.132
See you at 2.

14:41.137 --> 14:43.672
- Harbaugh.
- Sounds good.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.677
Make no mistake.
A nuclear-armed Iran

14:53.682 --> 14:55.979
is not a challenge
that can be contained.

14:55.984 --> 14:58.516
It would threaten
the elimination of Israel,

14:58.521 --> 15:00.184
the security of Gulf nations,

15:00.189 --> 15:02.653
and the stability
of the global economy.

15:02.658 --> 15:04.755
It risks triggering
a nuclear arms race...

15:04.760 --> 15:06.590
- [beeping]
- in the region

15:06.595 --> 15:08.559
and the unraveling of the
Nonproliferation Treaty.

15:08.564 --> 15:11.229
- [ding]
- That's why a coalition
of countries

15:11.234 --> 15:12.763
is holding the Iranian
government accountable,

15:12.768 --> 15:14.365
and that's why the United States

15:14.370 --> 15:17.268
will do what we must
to prevent Iran

15:17.273 --> 15:19.542
from attaining a nuclear weapon.

15:21.544 --> 15:24.375
I organized a plan
to transfer a sum of money

15:24.380 --> 15:27.478
to the candidate
who would work against

15:27.483 --> 15:30.214
the goal of a nuclear Iran.

15:30.219 --> 15:32.049
But...

15:32.054 --> 15:34.122
I put it in...

15:35.057 --> 15:37.125
the hands of the other guy.

15:40.496 --> 15:43.427
And that guy had set
the table at that moment

15:43.432 --> 15:45.529
to use it to employ a specialist

15:45.534 --> 15:48.766
to put the final systemization
on their program.

15:48.771 --> 15:51.269
So in May of 2012,
I was in the position

15:51.274 --> 15:56.178
of possibly having
single-handedly armed Iran.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.749
[Man speaking Egyptian]

16:09.625 --> 16:11.289
Ally:
So what we try to do

16:11.294 --> 16:12.790
is personalize
Stephen's recovery.

16:12.795 --> 16:15.493
- Right.
- Organizing his exercises

16:15.498 --> 16:18.128
around, say,
Stephen's favorite movie.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.163
Right.

16:19.168 --> 16:21.131
So this exercise

16:21.136 --> 16:22.700
is a comprehensive indication

16:22.705 --> 16:24.935
of where Stephen is
on his road to recovery.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.404
It involves recall,

16:26.409 --> 16:29.240
motor skills,
and sequencing functions.

16:29.245 --> 16:31.642
So did you guys
practice this at lunch?

16:31.647 --> 16:32.643
- Yes.
- Yeah?

16:32.648 --> 16:33.677
Yes.

16:33.682 --> 16:34.578
Okay.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.980
Let's see where we're at.

16:36.985 --> 16:38.220

No.

17:37.179 --> 17:38.376

This is Leslie Claret.

You are Leslie Claret?

18:44.980 --> 18:46.344
Are you on this project,

18:46.349 --> 18:50.381
something this...
something this size?

18:50.386 --> 18:52.249
Well, this is, uh...

18:52.254 --> 18:56.186
foundational division
at McMillan.

18:56.191 --> 18:57.388
I pay attention to it,

18:57.393 --> 18:58.756
but I'm not your point guy.

18:58.761 --> 19:00.391
I'm not your guy
on the ground because...

19:00.396 --> 19:02.092

19:02.097 --> 19:04.895
No. Thank you. No.

Our young bucks here handle
the day-to-day stuff.

19:09.338 --> 19:11.802
So, John,
let's just jump in here

19:11.807 --> 19:14.772
and give them the 10 cent
tour of the terrace plan.

19:14.777 --> 19:19.309
Yeah. Guys. Hey.

19:19.314 --> 19:20.711
Let's do it.

19:20.716 --> 19:22.145
So...

19:22.150 --> 19:24.782
uh, let's do the, uh...

19:24.787 --> 19:27.985
uh, let's start with
the patch handlers.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.687
Oh, shit.

19:29.692 --> 19:30.554
What?

19:30.559 --> 19:32.856
We're handler-free.

19:32.861 --> 19:34.257
We're what?

19:34.262 --> 19:35.426
We can't filter

19:35.431 --> 19:37.260
at any stage
during the transfer.

19:37.265 --> 19:39.597
I'm sorry. I thought
that was clear.

19:39.602 --> 19:42.232
Uh, we don't plate process
or filter with samplers

19:42.237 --> 19:44.673
or any patch process.

19:45.641 --> 19:46.670
Oh.

19:46.675 --> 19:48.906
Well, that's fine.
It's not uncommon.

19:48.911 --> 19:50.073
It's probably wise.

19:50.078 --> 19:52.476
John, throw out this week's
filter floor plan

19:52.481 --> 19:54.645
and just get
into the nitty-gritty

19:54.650 --> 19:57.786
of our systemized
nonfiltered diffusion.

20:02.391 --> 20:04.187
Can you give us a sec?

20:04.192 --> 20:06.256
I just want to...

20:06.261 --> 20:07.791
I don't want to overstep my...

20:07.796 --> 20:09.660
I want to hone in
on this with Leslie

20:09.665 --> 20:11.495
so we don't land
on any unsustainable

20:11.500 --> 20:14.264

along our line.

20:25.347 --> 20:27.415
- Yes.
- No problem.

20:29.452 --> 20:31.248
Leslie, do you mind
taking the lead?

20:31.253 --> 20:33.551
- I don't want to...
- You don't want to what?

20:33.556 --> 20:36.420
I... I thought the whole
thing was filtered.

20:36.425 --> 20:38.989
It's no big deal.
It's 101.

20:38.994 --> 20:40.691
Yeah, I'm not, uh...

20:40.696 --> 20:42.593

20:42.598 --> 20:44.695
I'm not prepared to pitch

20:44.700 --> 20:48.466
for an unprocessed filter line.

20:48.471 --> 20:49.967
I'm sorry.

20:49.972 --> 20:51.368
John, what the fuck?

20:51.373 --> 20:54.938
That's rote, 101, man.

20:54.943 --> 20:56.674

20:56.679 --> 20:58.709
Ugh.
Here's the thing.

20:58.714 --> 21:00.878
I was hired to run a division,

21:00.883 --> 21:03.013
and we employed you to help me,

21:03.018 --> 21:06.216
and you have serially
failed to do that.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.518
You are burdening me,

21:07.523 --> 21:09.386
and you are disrupting
the very important order

21:09.391 --> 21:11.655
of the way McMillan operates.

21:11.660 --> 21:15.397
The McMillan way.
101, man.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.363
All right.

21:20.368 --> 21:21.765
I'll do it myself.

21:21.770 --> 21:24.468
I'll do fucking junior work,

21:24.473 --> 21:26.236
work that wouldn't
have crossed my desk

21:26.241 --> 21:27.538
when I was your age...

21:27.543 --> 21:29.206
when I ran a company
at your age,

21:29.211 --> 21:30.474
not a fucking division...

21:30.479 --> 21:31.942
because I cared.

21:31.947 --> 21:34.244
And I was good because I cared.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.483
And you?

21:36.451 --> 21:39.254
You just don't seem to, son.

21:40.388 --> 21:42.024
Oh.

21:43.091 --> 21:47.095
And the roster for the trial
squad comes out on Monday.

21:48.864 --> 21:51.399
Don't bother
looking at it, Lakeman.

is happening there.

is from a strict sect.

22:30.639 --> 22:32.636
She's never left her home
in her life

22:32.641 --> 22:34.271
without a male escort.

22:34.276 --> 22:37.307
She bought a plane ticket
to Luxembourg...

22:37.312 --> 22:40.248
one ticket, no escort.

22:41.584 --> 22:44.147
She's going to get the money.

22:44.152 --> 22:46.288
And...

22:47.322 --> 22:49.119
And what?

22:49.124 --> 22:50.721
We...

22:50.726 --> 22:52.489
What do I do?

22:52.494 --> 22:53.757
You help John.

22:53.762 --> 22:55.726
Yeah.
I mean, of course.

22:55.731 --> 22:57.327
I'm gone. I just...
I don't...

22:57.332 --> 22:59.096
What is your reluctance, son?

22:59.101 --> 23:01.503
What? No. I don't...
I don't have one. I...

23:02.638 --> 23:04.501
It's...
Alice had asked me

23:04.506 --> 23:06.069
what John does,

23:06.074 --> 23:08.338
and I realized that I
don't even know, really.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.440
I... So how can I...

23:10.445 --> 23:13.848
Don't you have guys, like,
trained guys for this?

23:14.917 --> 23:17.485
I said I was going
to ask a lot of you.

23:18.286 --> 23:19.617
I'm also going to ask you

23:19.622 --> 23:22.590
not to ask me any more
questions, Edward.

23:26.161 --> 23:27.529
Get packed.

23:32.034 --> 23:34.869

23:46.181 --> 23:47.611
Mm, standard.

23:47.616 --> 23:50.480
- We can talk out here.
- Okay.

23:50.485 --> 23:52.650
For, like, an hour
or more, openly.

23:52.655 --> 23:54.184
What does she...
What does your wife

23:54.189 --> 23:57.054
think we're doing out here
in the garage for an hour?

23:57.059 --> 23:58.722
I told her we were
going to lift weights,

23:58.727 --> 24:00.223
so we should probably
lift weights

24:00.228 --> 24:02.464
because you can hear
the weights in the kitchen.

24:05.834 --> 24:08.231
How'd it go with
the Denon presentation?

24:08.236 --> 24:09.733
I'm fucked.

24:09.738 --> 24:11.473
What now?

24:13.876 --> 24:15.605
You got to go on that duck hunt,

24:15.610 --> 24:17.841

24:17.846 --> 24:19.242

or touch your face.

24:30.826 --> 24:32.622
- Or tell the truth.
- Right.

24:32.627 --> 24:34.124
There will be long silences.

24:34.129 --> 24:35.993
She'll try to stress
you out over time.

24:35.998 --> 24:38.361
Is there anything
that stresses you normally,

24:38.366 --> 24:40.898
like being hungry or...

24:40.903 --> 24:43.338
- caffeine?
- Twins.

24:44.006 --> 24:45.635
- Twins?
- Twins, yeah.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.904
They creep me out a little.

24:46.909 --> 24:48.105
They unsettle me.

24:48.110 --> 24:51.441
Well, that probably
won't come up.

24:51.446 --> 24:55.478
Dad, Mom said dinner 45 minutes.

24:55.483 --> 24:57.152
Okay. Thanks, girls.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.718
Cool. 45 minutes.
We can do legs.

25:00.723 --> 25:03.754
You got to go on that
duck hunt, John.

25:03.759 --> 25:06.456
Everyone gets drunk.
There's camaraderie.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.826
Everyone relaxes. Go.

25:08.831 --> 25:10.660
Win Leslie back.

25:10.665 --> 25:12.267
You got another plan?

25:15.103 --> 25:18.468
Can I tell you something?
Honestly?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.738
You kind of suck at piping.

25:20.743 --> 25:22.472
If you're going
to suck at piping

25:22.477 --> 25:24.274

you're not going to be
a McMillan Man.

25:28.851 --> 25:31.614
Leslie will most likely
fire me out there.

25:31.619 --> 25:32.716
Leslie won't.

25:32.721 --> 25:34.217
La Croix does that.

25:34.222 --> 25:35.986
He always does that.
He's good like that.

He's a good leader.

25:38.660 --> 25:39.790

That's the way I see it.

28:29.531 --> 28:31.228
You loved it?

28:31.233 --> 28:32.662
Yes.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.933
You loved being stabbed
in the leg in Luxembourg?

28:35.938 --> 28:38.206
No. Not that part.

28:39.374 --> 28:40.837
What part?

28:40.842 --> 28:42.906
Just...

28:42.911 --> 28:44.174
[sigh]

28:44.179 --> 28:46.914
the castles and stuff.

28:57.759 --> 29:00.290
Cold one, Leslie?

29:00.295 --> 29:01.591
Oh.

29:01.596 --> 29:03.898
No. I have my own.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.965
- Leslie.
- Yeah.

29:07.970 --> 29:09.866
I wanted to say to you

29:09.871 --> 29:11.834
I respect the way
you run the division.

29:11.839 --> 29:13.903
Great. Thanks, kid.

29:13.908 --> 29:17.874
Agathe: Describe the moments
just before your stabbing.

29:17.879 --> 29:21.244
Walking. Really dark.

29:21.249 --> 29:23.146
This figure appeared
in front of me.

29:23.151 --> 29:24.881
On Chantalain?

29:24.886 --> 29:26.716
On Chantalain.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.986
And I was checking my phone,

29:28.991 --> 29:30.253
and I looked up,

29:30.258 --> 29:31.721
and it seemed
like they were fighting

29:31.726 --> 29:32.855
to get past me,

29:32.860 --> 29:34.157
and they jostled me,

29:34.162 --> 29:35.925
and I said,
"Hey, man, watch it."

29:35.930 --> 29:37.394
Uh, they moved left,

29:37.399 --> 29:40.197
and then, unfortunately,
I moved right,

29:40.202 --> 29:41.864
and then they moved right,

29:41.869 --> 29:43.533
and then I got in their way,

29:43.538 --> 29:45.035
and I think
they mistakenly thought

29:45.040 --> 29:46.836
that I was trying
to impede them,

29:46.841 --> 29:48.905
and then, next thing I know,

29:48.910 --> 29:50.812
I got a hot slice in my quad.

29:51.946 --> 29:53.643
You were stabbed.

29:53.648 --> 29:55.612
Yes.

29:55.617 --> 29:58.915
Yes. And then I went
to the hospital,

29:58.920 --> 30:01.118
and then I went to dinner,

30:01.123 --> 30:03.320
and then I went to my room,

30:03.325 --> 30:06.694
and then I worked out.

30:16.004 --> 30:17.534
Hmm.

30:17.539 --> 30:18.840
[pen scratches]

30:20.708 --> 30:22.939
He's long gone.
He's gone.

30:22.944 --> 30:24.407
Do it this afternoon.

30:24.412 --> 30:26.209
It's just...
[sigh]... you know,

30:26.214 --> 30:27.877
doesn't show up for dinner.

30:27.882 --> 30:31.214
And he fucks up with Denon.

30:31.219 --> 30:33.250
Well, I'll give him a big talk

30:33.255 --> 30:35.323
in the little boat.

30:37.425 --> 30:39.989
What was the destination
of the walk you were on

30:39.994 --> 30:41.696
when you were attacked?

30:42.564 --> 30:43.626
Walking.

30:43.631 --> 30:45.562
Just enjoying
your beautiful sights,

30:45.567 --> 30:48.031
your castles,
with my friend John.

30:48.036 --> 30:49.632
John?

30:49.637 --> 30:51.305
Lakeman.

30:56.144 --> 30:58.141
Last sortie.
Then we'll haul ass.

30:58.146 --> 31:00.343
- Okay.
- Richie Rich, west marsh.

31:00.348 --> 31:02.412
You guys go east and south.

31:02.417 --> 31:04.752
Partner up, everyone.

31:05.587 --> 31:07.789
[chatter]

31:16.431 --> 31:19.967
John, you want to come with me?

31:22.404 --> 31:23.900
Yeah.

31:23.905 --> 31:27.509
Okay. Thanks, John.

31:29.644 --> 31:32.480
Agathe: And what was
your friend's destination?

31:34.749 --> 31:36.746
Ahem.

31:36.751 --> 31:39.682
Uh, we were...
we were strolling together.

31:39.687 --> 31:44.087
But he wasn't with you
when you were stabbed.

31:44.092 --> 31:46.156
No.

31:46.161 --> 31:48.791
Why did you stop
strolling together?

31:48.796 --> 31:52.729
I think he... he went
to prepare for a meeting.

31:52.734 --> 31:54.431
Mm-hmm.

31:54.436 --> 31:56.103
Where?

31:56.938 --> 31:58.606
I don't know.

32:00.342 --> 32:03.478
Back to his room, possibly.

32:05.447 --> 32:06.909
[inhale]

32:06.914 --> 32:08.583
[exhale]

32:10.452 --> 32:13.316
Did you make any phone calls

32:13.321 --> 32:16.219
around the time of your assault?

32:16.224 --> 32:19.889
- Uh, yes.
- Mm-hmm. To who?

32:19.894 --> 32:21.924
To my loving wife.

32:21.929 --> 32:23.498
Her name?

32:28.002 --> 32:29.666
Uh...

32:29.671 --> 32:31.868
I can't... Holy shit.

32:31.873 --> 32:34.103
What... Audrey.

32:34.108 --> 32:36.706
Jesus. Audrey McClaren.

32:36.711 --> 32:38.446
Sorry.

32:39.013 --> 32:41.378
[sigh]

32:41.383 --> 32:43.112
Would you write the following

32:43.117 --> 32:46.120
on a page of paper for me?

32:47.789 --> 32:49.219
[sigh]

32:49.224 --> 32:53.795
77 de Champlaine.

32:57.565 --> 32:59.462
Agathe:
I traveled this distance

32:59.467 --> 33:01.264
because a second man was stabbed

33:01.269 --> 33:03.366
within several blocks
of your assault,

33:03.371 --> 33:05.134
the same evening,

33:05.139 --> 33:07.069
within the same hour.

33:07.074 --> 33:10.845
And your wounds
are similarly sized.

33:12.347 --> 33:17.051
Assaults like this are
uncommon in Luxembourg City.

33:18.186 --> 33:19.982
I don't know anything
about that.

33:19.987 --> 33:21.718
I'm surprised to hear that.

33:21.723 --> 33:24.754
You read our newspaper
the next morning.

33:24.759 --> 33:28.858
It was a featured item
in the morning's paper.

33:28.863 --> 33:30.860
I meant...

33:30.865 --> 33:32.462
noth... anything further.

33:32.467 --> 33:34.497
Uh, yes, I heard
about the murder.

33:34.502 --> 33:36.399
Uh, I remember some of the staff

33:36.404 --> 33:37.800
was discussing it in the lobby,

33:37.805 --> 33:40.169
and I read the paper
only because I thought

33:40.174 --> 33:41.871
it might shed some
light on my attack.

33:41.876 --> 33:44.140
It might, you know,
illuminate my attack,

33:44.145 --> 33:45.942
but it didn't.
There weren't any facts

33:45.947 --> 33:48.345
that helped me have
a greater understanding

33:48.350 --> 33:50.084
of what happened to me.

33:53.388 --> 33:56.691
Thank you. That's all.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.490
I appreciate your time

34:00.495 --> 34:02.659
and your help
with our investigation.

34:02.664 --> 34:05.667
I'm sorry I couldn't
be more of a help.

34:31.125 --> 34:34.056
Lawrence:
I'm not from here, John.

34:34.061 --> 34:36.293
Yeah?

34:36.297 --> 34:38.127
From Montreal.

34:38.132 --> 34:40.630
Piping. Married into it.

34:40.635 --> 34:43.333
But you know,
we've had good success

34:43.338 --> 34:45.534
because, well,
I hire good people,

34:45.540 --> 34:48.710
and I let them guide and marshal
through their divisions.

34:49.610 --> 34:50.806
Cool.

34:50.812 --> 34:53.981
Yeah. That is cool.

34:58.820 --> 35:03.052
Never held a gun
until I came out here.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.822
Really. In fact,

35:05.827 --> 35:07.790
never got a bird
since I've been out here.

35:07.795 --> 35:11.294
Well, there's other
things to enjoy.

35:11.299 --> 35:15.532
I enjoy looking at Lori often.

35:15.537 --> 35:18.401
I guess it's like my hobby.

35:18.406 --> 35:19.602
- You, uh...
- Did you meet her?

35:19.607 --> 35:22.576
She's here with her
boyfriend Dick.

35:23.678 --> 35:25.041
I, uh...

35:25.046 --> 35:28.878
Uh, I've had a few beers.
I should stop talking.

35:28.883 --> 35:29.879
Okay.

35:29.884 --> 35:31.819
I think I love her.

35:33.054 --> 35:34.384
Uh, I'm certain I love her,

35:34.389 --> 35:37.086
and she won't give me
a second look.

35:37.091 --> 35:39.961
[ducks quacking]

35:42.364 --> 35:44.198
Uh...

35:45.232 --> 35:48.431
I'm scared before
pulling the trigger,

35:48.436 --> 35:50.767
and I don't like holding it.

35:50.772 --> 35:53.603
It's smelly, and it's a cheat.

35:53.608 --> 35:56.473
It would be one thing to use
a gun against an animal

35:56.478 --> 35:59.041
if you're the man
who invented guns,

35:59.046 --> 36:01.578
but if you just bought one
at the store,

36:01.583 --> 36:04.385
I mean, big whoop, right?

36:05.219 --> 36:07.154
Still...

36:09.491 --> 36:10.953
Still what?

36:10.958 --> 36:13.956
Still I'd like
to shoot a bird some day

36:13.961 --> 36:15.992
because when I'm feeling
optimistic,

36:15.997 --> 36:20.763
I think, well, maybe Lori
simply has never considered me

36:20.768 --> 36:22.632
because we're from
two different worlds,

36:22.637 --> 36:24.867
and those days, I think,

36:24.872 --> 36:26.936
Man, if I shoot
one of these birds

36:26.941 --> 36:28.538
on one of these outings,

36:28.543 --> 36:30.540
she might say...

36:30.545 --> 36:33.376
"Hey, Lawrence isn't
from a different planet.

36:33.381 --> 36:35.412
"He can get his hands dirty.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.213
"Hey, look at him.

36:37.218 --> 36:39.949
Hey, let's make love now."

36:39.954 --> 36:43.319
But I always come back
with zilch.

36:43.324 --> 36:46.055
Her boyfriend openly mocks me,

36:46.060 --> 36:48.190
which makes me...

36:48.195 --> 36:51.298
well, a world apart from Lori.

36:52.299 --> 36:53.996
John, Leslie says

36:54.001 --> 36:56.799
you're having trouble
finding your footing

36:56.804 --> 36:58.367
at McMillan.

36:58.372 --> 37:00.069
I care about this company,

37:00.074 --> 37:03.673
so I wanted to have you
out on this little boat

37:03.678 --> 37:06.042
and explore why it's not
working out

37:06.047 --> 37:09.646
and maybe figure out a way
for us to part on good terms.

37:09.651 --> 37:14.255
For you and McMillan
to part company.

37:15.457 --> 37:17.759
[quacking]

37:24.298 --> 37:25.967
[gunshot]

37:27.569 --> 37:29.136
[gunshot]

37:37.512 --> 37:38.875
I got jack.

37:38.880 --> 37:43.012
Whoo! Hey!
Check it out, fuckers!

37:43.017 --> 37:44.413
- Whoo!
- All right, Lawrence.

37:44.418 --> 37:45.848
I blasted them!

37:45.853 --> 37:48.818
I'd say they were
thousands of feet away.

37:48.823 --> 37:50.587
Well, maybe not thousands,

37:50.592 --> 37:52.354
but boy, were they up there.

37:52.359 --> 37:53.756
- Way.
- I mean, yeah.

37:53.761 --> 37:55.958
Why would the guy buy a car
when he can buy a truck?

37:55.963 --> 37:56.826
Yeah.

37:56.831 --> 37:59.328
Two shots, two ducks.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.131
You like this, you dumb fuck?

38:02.136 --> 38:04.300
Yeah, you do.
You love it.

38:04.305 --> 38:06.207
Just like I love...

38:07.575 --> 38:09.572
Just like I love this company

38:09.577 --> 38:11.340
and you guys

38:11.345 --> 38:12.609
and this guy right here.

38:12.614 --> 38:15.111
Come on in. My men.

38:15.116 --> 38:16.918
McMillan Men.

38:17.952 --> 38:21.350
You men ready to have
some fun in Luxembourg?

38:21.355 --> 38:23.653
Lakeman's not going
to Luxembourg.

38:23.658 --> 38:26.055
Well, that's not a divisional
decision, Leslie.

38:26.060 --> 38:29.258
That's an executive call,
and yeah, he is.

38:29.263 --> 38:30.493
This kid's got something.

38:30.498 --> 38:33.868
Come on in here,
my McMillan Men.

39:34.729 --> 39:37.059
He was okay with it.

39:37.064 --> 39:39.867
We'll hit a game
when I get back.

39:40.534 --> 39:42.198
He wants a snow globe

39:42.203 --> 39:44.466
from there, he said.

39:44.471 --> 39:46.307
Okay.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.072
I'll call you from there.

39:50.077 --> 39:51.774
Why?

39:51.779 --> 39:56.117
Uh, just to, you know, check in?

39:57.018 --> 39:58.285
Okay.

39:59.453 --> 40:00.922
Okay.

40:04.491 --> 40:06.560
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

40:16.704 --> 40:18.968
Can we go over this again?

40:18.973 --> 40:21.303
So all you needed for this trip

40:21.308 --> 40:23.039
to take care of everything,

40:23.044 --> 40:26.242
everything that's going on
in Luxembourg,

40:26.247 --> 40:27.844
$170,000,

40:27.849 --> 40:30.479
nine rolls of duct tape,

40:30.484 --> 40:32.014
and the telecast schedule

40:32.019 --> 40:37.153
for the English soccer squad
Jaywick Sands.

40:37.158 --> 40:38.821
Yeah.

40:38.826 --> 40:41.891
And I could use a chair
for in here.

40:41.896 --> 40:43.826
Yeah. We're working on that.

40:43.831 --> 40:47.234
So how did it go
with the Brazilians?

40:48.269 --> 40:49.531
Okay.

40:49.536 --> 40:52.039
They knew jujitsu,
didn't they, John?

40:55.376 --> 40:57.039
John.

40:57.044 --> 40:58.641
What?

40:58.646 --> 41:00.214
Didn't they?

41:01.649 --> 41:02.979
Yes.

41:02.984 --> 41:06.653
See? I don't waste
your time, guy.

41:07.621 --> 41:09.556
I'm the A-team.

41:15.596 --> 41:17.359
John, I think
the interview went okay.

41:17.364 --> 41:19.862
She asked me one thing
about you, and that's it:

41:19.867 --> 41:22.169
where you went when we split up.

41:25.807 --> 41:27.536
Get some rest.

41:27.541 --> 41:31.007
I need you to smuggle $170,000

41:31.012 --> 41:33.180
through the airport tomorrow.

41:40.888 --> 41:44.258
[train whistle blows]

41:57.939 --> 41:59.368
Thanks for letting
my buddy come in.

41:59.373 --> 42:01.804
Mm-hmm. Any dog
with a job is welcome.

42:01.809 --> 42:03.172
Dogs with jobs.

42:03.177 --> 42:05.674
- Yeah.
- Warms the heart.

42:05.679 --> 42:07.643
Yeah.

42:07.648 --> 42:09.746
Honey, is this your dog?

42:09.751 --> 42:12.114
We're just hanging out.

42:12.119 --> 42:15.484
Well, I know a little
about what these guys do.

42:15.489 --> 42:16.853
They're HALT dogs.

42:16.858 --> 42:18.020
What's that?

42:18.025 --> 42:21.157
Hungry, angry, lonely, tired.

42:21.162 --> 42:24.293
It's for, uh, trauma victims

42:24.298 --> 42:25.461
or addicts.

42:25.466 --> 42:26.662
Whoever might crack.

42:26.667 --> 42:27.997
Well, when they're all those,

42:28.002 --> 42:29.431
when they're HALT all at once,

42:29.436 --> 42:32.501
so they do. They crack.

42:32.506 --> 42:35.772
These guys are trained
to sense it coming,

42:35.777 --> 42:37.606
and they try
to calm their patients

42:37.611 --> 42:38.975
when they need to sleep

42:38.980 --> 42:40.176
and signal when they
need to eat.

42:40.181 --> 42:41.643
You know, that kind of thing?

42:41.648 --> 42:43.012
You should really get this guy

42:43.017 --> 42:44.713
back to wherever
he's supposed to be.

42:44.718 --> 42:48.289
Yeah. Yeah, I should.

42:51.859 --> 42:53.489
Chk-chk. [whistle]

42:53.494 --> 42:55.129
Come on.

43:43.911 --> 43:45.712
