WEBVTT

00:21.856 --> 00:23.422
You're late.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.161
Excellent... my source
equation files

00:29.163 --> 00:30.662
From the university.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.865
Now I can finish my work.

00:32.867 --> 00:36.335
Yeah, yeah, just
give me my money.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.704
There's your payment.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.205
Not that you'll have anywhere to

00:40.207 --> 00:41.974
Spend it when
I destroy the earth.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.712
Finders keepers.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.213
Hawk.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.715
Get the disk.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.550
There's five of us
against one girl.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.352
No, no, you don't understand.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.087
Where there's hawk, there's...

00:58.192 --> 01:00.426
Silverstone!

01:00.428 --> 01:02.428
You say that a lot, rat.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.931
Get my disk.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.469
Shockwave pod?
Shockwave pod.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.331
Everybody out!
It's gonna blow!

01:40.401 --> 01:42.201
Come on!

01:44.071 --> 01:46.638
Get out! Get out! Run!

01:46.640 --> 01:49.141
Move, come on.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.743
Get out the door! Silverstone!

01:51.745 --> 01:53.579
Run, hawk.
I'll take care of krabb.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.080
You can make it.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.116
Just a little farther.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.651
Come on, we're to the door.
We're almost out!

02:02.256 --> 02:06.258
Open the door, kragg!
Open the door!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.993
There's nothing
you can do, silverstone.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.495
He's sealed his own fate.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.830
Get out of there! Come on!

02:30.451 --> 02:32.184
You ok?

02:33.621 --> 02:35.621
Yeah.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.624
And cut. Oh, great
scene, you two.

02:38.626 --> 02:43.462
Fx... That explosion
was beautiful.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.631
Nice one, jett.
See you tomorrow.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.132
Everyone all right?

02:47.134 --> 02:49.201
Am I ok? Jett jackson, baby.

02:55.976 --> 02:59.044
Man, you look tired.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.546
I didn't say you looked bad.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.314
I said you looked tired.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.882
Maybe a little grumpy.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.551
'morning, boys.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.819
'morning, mr. Dupree.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.155
You know, j.B.,
I mean, I'm sorry.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.658
I just... my life's
been so hectic lately.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.661
I miss out on a few of the
simple pleasures... Like sleep.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.163
I worked this morning,
came here for my first class.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.365
Now I got to go back to the set,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.367
Then hurry back here
for my last class,

03:22.369 --> 03:23.869
Before going
to the studio again.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.172
You know... I like
my simple, boring life.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.740
Hey, guys.

03:34.848 --> 03:38.016
Oh... Oh! Look at the time.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.918
I've, I've got to go.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.358
Something tells me
I'm being set up.
No.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
I just...

03:48.362 --> 03:50.596
Well, I just wanted...

03:52.032 --> 03:53.865
Oh, why is this so difficult?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.367
Come on, kay, it's only me.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.604
It's not like you're going to
ask me to the prom or something.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.105
Ha...

04:01.609 --> 04:03.842
Uh, I've got to get to class.

04:08.115 --> 04:11.783
The rat was captured, but dr.
Kragg's men managed to escape.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.285
What about kragg?

04:13.287 --> 04:14.786
All information
leads us to believe

04:14.788 --> 04:16.755
He never made it out
after the explosion.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.992
All we found was this.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.404
That was in
kragg's lab?
Yes.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.606
I believe, if we
find out what it is,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.575
We'll find out what
happened to dr. Kragg.

04:36.577 --> 04:39.478
In the meantime,
there's other work to be done.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.914
Your assignment.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.750
Hope you got plenty
of mosquito repellent.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.318
We're headed to the amazon.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.589
You know what?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.090
Count me out.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.592
I need a break.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.828
Hello? This is mission omega
matrix. There are no breaks.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.330
I'm serious.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.599
I'm not just an agent.
There's more to me...

05:00.601 --> 05:02.934
You just wouldn't know it.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.804
I have no family, no friends.
This is not a life.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.507
This is a 24-7 job.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.008
And... Cut!

05:10.010 --> 05:12.110
Check the gate.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.612
I was great.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.113
You were good.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.615
That's an hour for lunch.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.217
Nice scene, jett. All right.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.459
You, uh...

05:27.461 --> 05:29.795
Lookin' for something, jett?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.130
Yeah, yeah, I put
my soda on this console

05:32.132 --> 05:34.366
Right before the scene,
and now it's not there.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.468
Mmm, was it red, aluminum?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.470
Half-filled
with soda

05:38.472 --> 05:40.639
And sitting on top of my

05:40.641 --> 05:45.310
$6,845 electrics board?

05:45.312 --> 05:47.479
No, that doesn't
sound like mine.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.648
Jett, please...
Dude,

05:49.650 --> 05:52.484
If that soda had spilled, who
knows what could have happened.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.152
Pff, it won't happen again.

05:54.154 --> 05:57.322
Look, I'd love to stay...
Chat it out with you,

05:57.324 --> 05:59.024
But I got to run to school.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.093
Catch you later.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.200
Jett, babe, pull over.
I got some exciting news.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.335
Plunkett, I didn't
know you were in town.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.837
I don't have time to chat.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.538
I'm going to be late for school.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.040
It can't wait.
The studio called.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.042
They want to extend
<i>silverstone</i> three more years.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.744
They need to know
you're on board.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.746
Three years?

06:20.748 --> 06:23.515
I don't know, plunkett. I'll
need time to think about it.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.183
What's to think about?

06:25.185 --> 06:27.185
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.687
Just sign on the dotted line

06:28.689 --> 06:30.856
And it's nothing
but smooth sailing ahead.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.859
Oh!

06:33.861 --> 06:35.660
Ahh... Oh, dang.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.930
Hot, hot. Very hot!

06:38.932 --> 06:41.433
Booker,

06:41.435 --> 06:43.702
Call me if you need a witness.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.938
Oh... Dang.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.074
Oh, boy.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.575
Of course you're going to do

06:50.577 --> 06:52.077
The show... what's
to think about?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.112
I don't know, between
<i>silverstone</i> and school.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.615
Late nights, early mornings,
lost week ends.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.418
I don't even know who I am.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.919
Read <i> teen weekly...</i>
<i>They just did</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:02.554
A pretty in-depth piece on you.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.055
Now everybody knows who you are.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.557
That's not me, man.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.058
That's me, the star.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.461
Hey,
silverstone.
See what I mean?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.565
You <i> da</i> man.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.133
See? That's who you are.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.902
Like tank wilson said,
"you <i> da</i> man."

07:16.904 --> 07:18.403
Hey, kay.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.905
Hey.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.940
Right, I'm silverstone.
I'm the man, the star.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.309
But, do you hear the name
jett mentioned anywhere?

07:24.311 --> 07:27.412
No, that's 'cause
he's gotten lost.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.914
Well, I'm sure you'll find him.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.149
Look, I got to get
to the rental shop

07:31.151 --> 07:32.918
Before they run out
of black tuxes,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.419
And I have to wear one

07:34.421 --> 07:36.788
Of those powder-blue,
puffy shirt thingies.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.590
If it's any consolation to you,

07:38.592 --> 07:40.258
You do make a lot of sense.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.760
I don't know how you've managed.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.495
It's so much work
for one person.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.297
Thanks, kay.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.632
That means a lot.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.267
You were going to tell me

07:49.269 --> 07:50.769
Something this morning
when the...

07:50.771 --> 07:52.270
Bell rang.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.772
Yeah.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.274
Yeah... Sure hope
the bell rings again.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.276
Sorry, no more bells today.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.811
Ha...

07:59.813 --> 08:02.514
All right, uh... Jett,
are you going to the prom?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.816
Ahhh! I knew it.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.786
I knew you were going
to ask me to go with you.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.022
No, I was asking if you were
<i>going</i> to the prom.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.691
You know,<i> going?</i>

08:12.693 --> 08:17.128
Oh... Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm going.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.864
I was thinking I might head over

08:18.866 --> 08:21.666
After I finish work
at the studio, you know...

08:21.668 --> 08:23.802
How 'bout you?

08:23.804 --> 08:27.706
Yeah, but, you know,
I'm going by myself. You?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.509
Yeah, yeah, by myself.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.010
Yeah.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.511
So... Since,

08:33.514 --> 08:38.316
Since you're going by yourself
and I'm going by myself,

08:38.318 --> 08:40.852
Maybe we could... Hang out...

08:40.854 --> 08:42.687
Ha...

08:42.688 --> 08:45.156
When we're there...
By ourselves.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.159
Of course, ha, ha...

08:48.161 --> 08:50.896
Maybe even dance.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.899
Well, yeah.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.501
After all, it,
uh... It is a dance.

08:56.503 --> 09:00.005
Yeah, yeah, it is
a dance... ha, ha...

09:00.007 --> 09:01.640
Ha...

09:03.243 --> 09:06.177
Dude, you must be so stoked.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.879
Going on your first
date with kayla.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.581
Look, we're just going to go to

09:09.583 --> 09:12.751
A gym and hang
out... Maybe dance.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.020
Jett, it's the prom.
It's a date.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.521
It's not.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.023
It's a date.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.524
I don't th...

09:19.526 --> 09:21.026
Date. Date. Date.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.527
All right, man, it's a date.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.196
Yes! I knew it was
just a matter of time.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.698
What was a matter of time?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.099
You and kayla, kayla and you.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.101
Dude, it's been
obvious for years.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.603
No... ach!

09:31.605 --> 09:33.104
Smoke machine's working.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.606
Sorry.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.107
No, no, we're
just friends who...

09:36.109 --> 09:39.377
Have liked each other
for the longest time, only...

09:39.379 --> 09:43.949
Neither one of you
would admit it, until... Now.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.951
Dude, it's the prom.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.620
It's your first date with kayla.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.624
This, my friend,
is a special night.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.292
Yeah, it is.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.127
Oh, they grow up so fast.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.629
You're crazy, you're crazy.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.130
It's big.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.632
What, what's big?

10:00.634 --> 10:02.634
Everything. The studio is
throwing everything at us.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.135
Money, directing, another pilot,

10:04.137 --> 10:05.637
Two movie deals...
You're not happy.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.138
I, I don't know.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.140
Then, let me tell you.
You are happy.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.109
But the studio needs
an answer by tomorrow.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.911
They said, if you turn it down,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.412
Then they're going to have to

10:14.414 --> 10:16.081
End the series with
something really big.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.416
Wh-what does
big mean?

10:18.418 --> 10:19.918
Fill in the blanks, babe.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
But you have the power
to stop them.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.923
And you can do it right here
on the set of <i> silverstone.</i>

10:24.925 --> 10:27.425
We'll gather the cast and crew
and make the announcement.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.128
And get this... during a live
press conference, huh, huh?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.630
Plunkett, I need some time

10:31.632 --> 10:33.131
To think on this.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.800
Sure, sure...
You think about it.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.270
Ok, well, I just talked to jett.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.839
He wants to think about it.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.155
Will you catch that thing?
It's going to hit me.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.891
Duck.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.060
You should
have knocked.
I did.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.429
You didn't
answer.
You should've
taken the hint.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.568
Look, I don't know what you're

11:43.570 --> 11:46.571
So angry about... you and I
have it pretty good here.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.641
You've got to stop wanting to
some place, or somebody, else.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.411
Fine... ignore me,
but the fact is,

11:53.413 --> 11:56.081
We've got
a stage three emergency.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.349
We're on a plane in 10 minutes.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.885
What part of the word "no"
don't you understand?

12:00.887 --> 12:03.755
Silverstone...
Get out.

12:03.757 --> 12:08.259
Get... Out.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.264
And... Cut!

12:13.266 --> 12:15.266
Nice! Ha, ha.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.535
Looks like that's a wrap
for tonight. I'll see...

12:19.906 --> 12:24.275
Sorry, guys... Apparently,
that was no good for camera.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.144
We're going to have to go again.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.048
Hey, john, man...

12:30.050 --> 12:32.083
It's my prom.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.752
We're all late
for something, jett.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.553
You wanted to be
an actor, right?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.122
Let's reset.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.324
Ok, resetting
the number one's, everyone.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.122
I love this song.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.191
Mmm, yeah, so do I.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.630
Aw... Sweetie, I'm sorry
you missed your prom.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.331
Can I buy you a soda?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.100
Naw.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.802
Was it fun?

13:23.804 --> 13:26.938
Ha, ha, it's fun when
I dance, not chaperone.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.674
But your friends looked like
they enjoyed themselves.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.943
J.B. Won the dance contest.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.446
And kayla, oh,
kayla looked great.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.982
She always looks great.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.218
Man, I really blew it.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.289
Work ran late?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.291
Yeah.

13:46.293 --> 13:50.628
Hey, plunkett called and
told me that the studio

13:50.630 --> 13:52.297
Wants <i> silverstone</i>
for three more years.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.798
You must be thrilled.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.800
Yeah.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.536
Ok, that's not a happy yeah.

14:00.807 --> 14:04.943
Mom, I don't think I want
to be silverstone any more.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.146
If this has something to do with

14:08.148 --> 14:10.548
Missing your prom...
There'll be others.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.818
No, there won't.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.653
Not like this.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.155
This was really important to me.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.990
It was my prom. It was kayla.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.892
And I missed it
because of the show.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.895
What more am I going to miss
in the next three years?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.663
I mean, what have
I missed already?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.665
It's hard.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.568
I get how lucky I am.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.337
I understand how much
money I'm making.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.838
Baby,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.174
If you're not happy
doing what you're doing,

14:36.176 --> 14:38.176
Then knowing how lucky you are

14:38.178 --> 14:41.079
And how much money you're
making doesn't mean a thing.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.984
Thanks, mom.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.022
I guess I'll sleep on it

14:51.024 --> 14:53.258
And make my announcement
on set tomorrow.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.104
You know, I'm kind of
glad no one's here.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.373
Go to the prom...
Leave with your mother.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.375
It's a minor deduction
in cool points.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.876
'night.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.279
Good night.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.047
Come on, jett,
sign the contracts now,

15:16.049 --> 15:18.549
So I can show them off
at the press conference.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.051
I already
told you... no.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.552
You're going to
sign them, right?

15:21.554 --> 15:23.621
Listen, plunkett,
I got a scene to do.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.458
We've learned what this is.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.429
Dr. Kragg's space/time
continuum machine.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.232
Nice job. Looks
almost good as new.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.234
If that's all,
I'll be in my quarters.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.735
Silverstone.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.237
I'm not quite sure what phase

15:39.239 --> 15:40.772
Of adolescent drama
you're going through,

15:40.774 --> 15:43.741
But whatever it is,
I need you to set it aside.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.110
We're in a stage three emergency

15:46.112 --> 15:49.614
So you want me to save
the world... Again?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.115
Forget it.
Hawk can do it.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.318
We're dealing with
dr. Kragg, silverstone.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.486
No, we're not.
I destroyed him.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.592
There is no evidence
of that, silverstone.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.429
I need you to take
this seriously.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.264
I need you to take this

16:06.266 --> 16:07.932
Mission seriously.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.101
Kragg is dead
and so is his machine.

16:10.103 --> 16:14.439
This is a stage three
emergency, silverstone.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.107
No.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.512
Jett! Watch out!

16:48.475 --> 16:51.142
Ohh... I feel like I
got hit by a truck.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.643
Close, my friend.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.379
You were thrown
across the room by

16:54.381 --> 16:56.314
A power surge from
dr. Kragg's machine.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.815
Whoa...

16:57.817 --> 16:59.984
Just relax, we'll get you
some medical attention.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.353
No, no, I'm
all right. I just...

17:02.355 --> 17:03.888
Here, here.
Come on.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.390
Phew...

17:05.392 --> 17:07.191
Hawk, I need you in here, stat.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.527
Sory about that, nigel.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.063
We had that
scene nailed.
Nigel?

17:12.065 --> 17:14.832
What happened?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.367
Something went wrong
with cub-man's machine.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.868
It through me across the room.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.405
We're going to have to
re-do that scene.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.510
It's not that big a deal, guys.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.244
I'm sure cubby can fix it.

17:30.183 --> 17:34.752
Artemus... What is
he talking about?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.029
He's coming to.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.864
Oh... What happened?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.266
I'm not sure, but

17:48.268 --> 17:50.068
You were standing
by that machine,

17:50.070 --> 17:51.736
Then there were sparks and you

17:51.738 --> 17:53.237
Were flying across the room.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.739
I'm all right.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.240
I believe I know what happened.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.243
Someone, who shall
remain nameless,

17:59.245 --> 18:02.246
Left their soda can
on my console...

18:02.248 --> 18:03.881
Again.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.217
And this time it spilled,

18:06.219 --> 18:09.954
Causing a surge, if you will.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.956
Who are you?

18:11.958 --> 18:14.459
Oh, ho, you gave us
quite a scare there.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.294
Don't touch me!
Respecting
your space.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.629
Artemus, who are all
these people, and what

18:18.631 --> 18:21.132
Are they doing at mission
omega matrix headquarters?

18:21.134 --> 18:22.800
Jett, are you all right?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.368
Jett?

18:30.577 --> 18:32.577
Hey, jett bro.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.078
It's me, cubby.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.581
Cub-man, cub-meister,
chez cub-a-roni.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.749
Uh, listen, dude,

18:38.751 --> 18:40.751
You whacked
your upstairs mainframe

18:40.753 --> 18:42.587
Pretty hard... you should park

18:42.589 --> 18:44.789
Your hard drive until
someone can check you out.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.591
Do you work
for mission omega matrix?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.826
Um... Yeah.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.995
Yeah, kind of.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.764
I design the doo-dads
and the doo-hinkeys

18:53.766 --> 18:55.299
And the whatcha-ma-call-it's

18:55.301 --> 18:57.602
That you use to
save the world every week.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.438
I.D. Number?
Four?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.106
Who is he?

19:02.108 --> 19:04.208
Who are these people?

19:05.945 --> 19:09.647
This is some sort of test,

19:09.649 --> 19:12.483
Right, artemus?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.653
This is a test?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.288
Yes.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.990
It's a test.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.491
Are you all right?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.993
I'm fine. I'm all right.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.295
I don't know about
the rest of these people.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.796
I was in make-up,
I heard...

19:25.798 --> 19:27.632
Make-up?
You don't wear make-up.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.802
Don't wear make-up.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.471
He's just joking with you.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.206
Maybe the cub-man
should come along.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.375
Just to make
sure you...
alone.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.764
Ohh!

20:07.173 --> 20:10.741
: Somebody did
call the paramedics, right?

20:17.383 --> 20:20.651
What have you done with mission
omega matrix headquarters?

20:34.534 --> 20:35.933
Jett, baby.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.602
It's about time.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.437
Everyone is waiting
for the big announcement.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.938
Especially me.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.440
Are you ready? Good.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.041
All right, everyone.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.543
Here he is.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.245
Just as I promised.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.746
I give you, jett jackson.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.783
Rumour has it
that the network is

20:52.785 --> 20:55.086
Offering you another
three years of <i> silverstone,</i>

20:55.088 --> 20:56.587
Not to mention what is reported

20:56.589 --> 20:58.356
To be an obscene
amount of money.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.260
We need more than that, jett.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.961
In a business
where cash is king,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.597
Are you going to take
your slice of royalty?

21:06.599 --> 21:09.600
There are millions of fans that
are waiting for an answer, jett.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.303
Go on. Tell 'em, jett.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.071
Yes, jett.
Tell us.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.307
Will there be
three more years of <i> silverstone.</i>

21:23.750 --> 21:25.916
No.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.452
Jett! Jett!

21:28.454 --> 21:31.922
Please, just a couple
comments... Jett.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.804
Jett, sorry...
I know I promised

21:46.806 --> 21:48.673
I'd be here, I had car trouble.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.978
Jett!

21:53.980 --> 21:55.780
Want a lift out of here?

21:55.782 --> 21:58.049
Jett, don't run!

21:59.452 --> 22:01.852
Press or no press, buckle up.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.357
Jett! Jett!

22:06.359 --> 22:08.626
It is imperative that
we be patient with him.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.161
Wait a minute, my friend.

22:10.163 --> 22:13.631
I've called for our medical team
to come and take a look at you.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.132
What's with
the improvising, nigel?

22:15.134 --> 22:17.968
That's not even close
to what's in the script.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.204
Someone call cut.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.940
John, hey, john. Call cut, man.

22:29.315 --> 22:30.815
Where's the crew?

22:30.817 --> 22:32.383
Artemus,
I think he's delusional.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.884
I'm not delusional,

22:33.886 --> 22:36.153
And he's not artemus,
he's nigel essex.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.822
And you're not hawk,
you're riley grant.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.990
Silverstone...

22:39.992 --> 22:42.560
I'm not silverstone...
I don't know what kind of game

22:42.562 --> 22:44.628
You two are
playing here, but I'm gone.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.670
There's no hallway here.

22:52.672 --> 22:56.173
This is a sound stage.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.209
Where's the lights?

22:58.211 --> 23:00.378
Where's the cameras?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.747
Where am I? Where am I?

23:02.749 --> 23:04.315
What are you doing?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.394
There's nothing to see here.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.662
Go on about your business.

23:31.444 --> 23:34.378
 Yeah, yeah 

23:34.380 --> 23:35.880
 been thinking
about you baby 

23:35.882 --> 23:38.549
Hey, what's up?

23:38.551 --> 23:40.751
Just yesterday you told me
you loved that song.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.720
Yesterday?

23:42.722 --> 23:45.423
Yeah. After the prom, remember?

23:45.425 --> 23:48.058
Uh, yeah. Sure.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.593
Look, thanks for the lift.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.595
Pull over, I think
I'll walk from here.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.799
Jett jackson, you are not
getting out of this car.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.734
It's been a big day and...

23:56.736 --> 23:58.936
You're starting to show it.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.938
Maybe you just need
something to eat.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.440
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.075
And I am not
taking no for an answer.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.945
Tonight, you eat with your mom.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.247
 ...I've been spinning
like a merry-go-round 

24:10.249 --> 24:12.583
 indications of 

24:12.585 --> 24:14.118
 a storm
touching ground... 

24:14.120 --> 24:16.120
Mom?

24:16.122 --> 24:20.991
 ...But I guess it was
a heartbreak from the north 

24:26.265 --> 24:28.432
Is he going to be normal again?

24:28.434 --> 24:31.268
I mean, as normal
as silverstone gets?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.971
Knock it off, j.B.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.806
You knucklehead.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.975
Sleep well, my young friend.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.511
Tomorrow, the world
needs you once again.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.687
Here we are.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.327
Why are we stopping?

24:56.329 --> 24:58.696
Because you're home.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.401
Home.

25:06.539 --> 25:09.707
Can we go in?

25:09.709 --> 25:14.044
Unless your father's
changed the locks you can.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.614
But I've go to
get home and do some work.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.351
I suppose you forgot
we're divorced?

25:20.353 --> 25:22.820
No.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.522
You're tired.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.090
Go in and get some sleep.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.186
Father?

25:56.188 --> 25:58.856
No, it's the milkman.
Where's your key?

25:58.858 --> 26:01.525
Dad?
I'm on the phone.
We'll talk later.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.260
Right.

26:05.431 --> 26:10.034
Sorry, mayor beale.
Jett was at the door.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.535
Of course he's got a key.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.671
Look, can we just
get on with business?

26:15.942 --> 26:17.942
You're running for sheriff?

26:17.944 --> 26:19.443
You already know that.

26:19.445 --> 26:20.945
I'm on the phone.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.513
Sorry.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.783
Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh-huh.

26:25.785 --> 26:29.720
Mayor beale, we...

26:31.223 --> 26:32.723
Ki-yah!

26:32.725 --> 26:35.492
Ki-yah, yourself.
Now help me with these bags.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.654
So that's him.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.493
And that's me.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.470
Artemus, I'm not sure
what's happening.

27:19.472 --> 27:22.439
It's kind of weird, but...

27:22.441 --> 27:28.145
For the first time
in my life, I have a family.

27:40.192 --> 27:43.694
Cool! Can you
show me how to do that?

27:48.501 --> 27:51.969
You said you were coming
by the store after work.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.637
I got a ride with my mom.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.472
We didn't go that way.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.476
What way? It's right
across the street.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.546
Are you sure this
is a regulation hoop?

28:04.817 --> 28:07.484
What?

28:07.486 --> 28:08.986
Write your name down.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.487
Why?

28:10.489 --> 28:12.056
I want to show you something.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.665
Jb.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.367
What?

28:23.369 --> 28:25.502
Nothing.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.738
But you said you were gonna...

28:27.740 --> 28:30.240
You're weird, jackson.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.976
Ok. Here it is.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.081
Nice shot...

28:37.083 --> 28:38.749
Jb.

28:40.186 --> 28:43.420
You know, I may be
the only one in town

28:43.422 --> 28:45.422
Who's glad
you turned down the show.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.058
I didn't want
to go another three years

28:48.060 --> 28:50.427
Having my best friend
only half time.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.764
Thanks... And you
came all the way

28:53.766 --> 28:55.265
Here just to tell me that?

28:55.267 --> 28:58.268
No... I came here to tell you

28:58.270 --> 29:00.571
That kayla was
kind of upset with you.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.072
Kayla?

29:02.074 --> 29:06.410
Kayla. The girl
you stood-up at the prom?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.046
You might want
to talk to her tomorrow.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.583
Just thought
you might like to know.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.151
Later.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.695
I think I might like
being jett jackson.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.808
<i>Silverstone</i> set.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.676
Must have dozed off.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.248
Ugh!

29:44.250 --> 29:45.749
The doors are jammed.

29:45.751 --> 29:48.652
Hey, somebody open these doors.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.261
All right, cubster.

29:57.263 --> 30:01.298
Way to improve the vortex ball.

30:04.270 --> 30:08.105
It's almost like it's... Real.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.009
Whoa!

30:19.952 --> 30:22.452
Duck!

30:22.454 --> 30:24.288
Hey, rye.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.291
I had the strangest dream that
you and nigel thought you were

30:27.293 --> 30:29.293
Really hawk and artemus
and were trying to

30:29.295 --> 30:31.028
Convince me that
I was really silverstone.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.797
And, of course, you're not.

30:33.799 --> 30:36.300
Right.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.468
Duck!

30:38.470 --> 30:40.704
Can you catch that thing?

30:51.717 --> 30:54.384
Ahh... Oof!

31:00.392 --> 31:02.726
Nice.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.896
Put the ball down.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.732
Sorry.
Yeah.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.902
I think you should
go talk to artemus.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.805
Artemus?

31:17.910 --> 31:19.409
Got me.

31:19.411 --> 31:23.413
Yeah, I got you.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.749
So anyway... Artemus,

31:25.751 --> 31:28.719
I mean....Nigel.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.220
He's in the lair.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.423
Just like old nigel.
Always wanting to rehearse.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.492
Tell him I'll be
there in a minute.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.269
Excuse, me did...

31:45.271 --> 31:46.770
Ok.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.772
Excuse me,
did they add a new scene,

31:48.774 --> 31:51.041
Because I don't remember
this set in the script.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.643
Carry on.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.146
This is a great set.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.953
No.

32:02.955 --> 32:06.123
We do not mobilize until
I get a full assessment.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.959
Go out there yourself
and send me back a full report.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.061
What's going on?
Where's the crew?

32:11.063 --> 32:12.562
Where is everybody, nigel?

32:12.564 --> 32:14.398
Silverstone, sit down.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.401
All right.
Enough is enough. Joke is over.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.069
It's not funny any more.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.971
This is no joke, silverstone.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.607
Yesterday, you were
involved in an accident

32:23.609 --> 32:25.976
With the space/time
continuum machine.

32:25.978 --> 32:28.745
You seem to have lost
your memory and found another.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.247
Nigel, what is this...

32:30.249 --> 32:31.782
Calling me nigel
shows that loss.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.251
I am artemus.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.920
Second in command
of mission omega matrix.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.889
And you are our top agent.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.495
This is good. This is good.

32:45.497 --> 32:49.266
It is imperative
that you believe me.

32:49.268 --> 32:53.403
If you don't, then I'm afraid
the world may be doomed.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.010
I think I should sit down now.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.452
Dr. Kregg's
space/time continuum machine.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.953
Although partially destroyed
during your mission,

33:09.955 --> 33:11.355
I had it rebuilt.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.224
Yeah. I remember
that scene. It was great.

33:19.131 --> 33:22.699
If you are not silverstone,

33:22.701 --> 33:24.201
Who do you think you are?

33:24.203 --> 33:26.870
Jett jackson.
You are not

33:26.872 --> 33:28.805
Jett jackson.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.474
You are silverstone.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.476
You've been with me
for over 14 years.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.512
Right, that's the back story.
My name is jett jackson.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.314
I live in wilsted with
my great-grandmother.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.815
My father's the sheriff.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.484
My friends are jb and kayla.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.386
And I can't believe
I'm defending myself.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.054
Hawk was right.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.224
You're in no condition
to take on this assignment.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.328
Artemus, your monitor.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.063
I think I may have
found something.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.504
After kragg's body didn't turn
up in our forensic search

34:00.506 --> 34:02.239
Of the explosion site,
I got suspicious.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.007
I had research recover

34:04.009 --> 34:06.009
Our satellite footage
from that night.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.677
Take a look at this.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.179
Zoom in.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.679
Freeze.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.417
Dr. Robert deloria,
assistant to dr. Kragg.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.420
Injured, but
very much still alive.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.188
Fast forward. Punch in.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.257
Freeze.

34:20.259 --> 34:23.760
The same dr. Robert deloria.
Pronounced dead at the scene.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.695
Dr. Kragg.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.264
He's still alive.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.068
Yes. Excellent
work, hawk.

34:31.070 --> 34:34.571
Kragg took on the appearance of
deloria and made his escape.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.407
Apparently he's perfected
molecular transference.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.109
But, so?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.745
I mean, what threat can he pose?

34:41.746 --> 34:44.748
Some whacked out scientist who
can take the shape of dead guys.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.248
Not much money in that, right?

34:46.251 --> 34:47.951
His ability to change form is

34:47.953 --> 34:49.920
Only the start
of our molecular nightmares.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.389
Silverstone, if
you are up to it,

34:52.391 --> 34:54.724
I want you and hawk
to go to chicago.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.460
Chicago?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.562
Oh, uh, yeah.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.631
I'll go to "chicago."

35:01.633 --> 35:04.234
Hey, "artemus," I know.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.571
Why not take the "mission
omega matrix helicopter..."

35:07.573 --> 35:09.940
From the helipad...

35:09.942 --> 35:11.441
On the top?

35:11.443 --> 35:14.644
Precisely. It's waiting
for you on the pad.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.583
: Uh, guys, uh...

35:19.585 --> 35:22.152
I was actually kidding
about the chopper thing.

35:32.097 --> 35:35.165
This is impossible.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.669
Chicago's gone.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.347
Impressive, isn't it?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.848
I thought you were

35:51.850 --> 35:53.350
Back at headquarters.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.119
Some things
you have to see for yourself.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.355
Where is chicago?

35:58.357 --> 36:01.291
Where are the buildings?
Where are all the people?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.959
Three very good questions.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.128
No doubt kragg's handiwork.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.630
Wait a minute.

36:06.632 --> 36:10.367
Kragg has the ability
to rearrange molecules.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.870
Maybe he could make chicago
look like denver but...

36:13.872 --> 36:15.438
Chicago's just gone.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.643
You two must go to new york.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.811
There's word that's
where kragg will strike next.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.047
Good luck.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.655
Silverstone, you coming?

36:31.657 --> 36:34.224
Yeah.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.595
I'll see you
in new york, silverstone.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.476
Jett.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.283
Hey, jett.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.919
That's me.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.921
Hey.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.789
Hey.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.595
'morning... J.B.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.964
Good morning... Jett.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.100
Where are you going?

37:50.102 --> 37:51.635
School.

37:51.637 --> 37:54.070
You may want to try
the other direction.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.572
I mena, you can get there

37:55.574 --> 37:57.407
The way you're going, but you'd

37:57.409 --> 37:59.276
Have to walk around
the entire planet.

37:59.278 --> 38:02.579
This way, it only
takes 10 minutes.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.981
Right.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.952
Well, let's see.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.454
On a scale of 1 to 10,
I guess I'd

38:11.456 --> 38:13.590
Have to give you
about 11 in popularity.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.659
So, everybody likes me.

38:15.661 --> 38:18.094
Why do you even have to ask?

38:18.096 --> 38:19.596
Just checking.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.997
And what about you?

38:20.999 --> 38:25.602
Well, if you're an 11, I guess
I'd have to be about a 13.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.772
So, you're the most popular kid

38:28.774 --> 38:31.274
In school, and
we're best friends.

38:31.276 --> 38:33.677
That's cool.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.348
Mr. Dupree, hey.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.116
Good morning, boys.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.285
Good morning.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.120
Do I know him?

38:44.122 --> 38:46.956
What? Oh, ho,
I get it.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.458
Because we haven't seen

38:48.460 --> 38:49.959
Mr. Dupree out
of that old

38:49.961 --> 38:51.961
Droopy suit he's
been wearing since...

38:51.963 --> 38:53.830
Are you moving?

38:53.832 --> 38:56.032
Nice deflection...
We'll get back to

38:56.034 --> 39:00.136
The droopy suit in a minute...
Yes, I am moving.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.972
New house. And I thought
they didn't pay teachers well.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.541
Not what they're worth.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.210
But I'm not moving up.
I'm moving away.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.845
What?

39:08.847 --> 39:12.382
You can't move away.
We need you here.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.384
I'm afraid it's out
of my hands, j.B.,

39:14.386 --> 39:16.986
What with the show closing
and the crew moving on.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.322
The school will
have to make cutbacks.

39:19.324 --> 39:21.858
I've been offered
a new position in durham.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.493
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.028
So was I.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.997
But as far as today
is concerned...

39:27.999 --> 39:31.234
I will put on my same
old droopy suit,

39:31.236 --> 39:34.738
And I will be at school
in time for my first class.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.607
I expect to see both
of you there too.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.849
Man, that's a real drag
about mr. Dupree.

39:45.851 --> 39:49.519
But there's no need for you
to feel guilty.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.020
About what?

39:51.022 --> 39:52.756
Mr. Dupree and all
the other people

39:52.758 --> 39:54.257
Moving out of wilsted
because you're

39:54.259 --> 39:55.759
Not doing the show any more.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.528
Ok, I won't.

39:58.530 --> 40:01.231
Jett, what is it?

40:01.233 --> 40:04.434
The rat.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.938
You mean maury, the actor
who plays the rat.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.548
Deputy.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.049
Ahhh!

40:20.051 --> 40:22.986
Dang! Why did you
have to scare me like that for?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.923
Deputy, I may require
your assistance.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.425
What are you doing?

40:28.427 --> 40:29.926
Down, down.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.795
There's a dangerous
felon at that cafe.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.296
Felon?

40:33.298 --> 40:34.931
Yes, he must have
escaped prison,

40:34.933 --> 40:36.633
Where he was
serving time for helping

40:36.635 --> 40:38.134
To mastermind
a catastrophic event that

40:38.136 --> 40:39.636
Would've ended life
on this planet.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.906
Dang! Oh, you're
just kidding, right?

40:42.908 --> 40:45.575
You're not kidding.

40:45.577 --> 40:50.246
Dang, um, ok, yeah,
I'm going to call the sheriff.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.982
No time.
No, no time.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.918
Cover me. I'm going in.

40:54.920 --> 40:59.589
Uh, uh, jett, shouldn't that

40:59.591 --> 41:01.090
Maybe be me

41:01.092 --> 41:02.826
Doing that?

41:14.105 --> 41:17.640
Oh, dang.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.009
It's back
to the cage for you, rat.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.682
Good work, deputy.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.750
He's all yours.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.362
Well, good morning, maury.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.366
'morning, booker.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.543
This is amazing.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.044
What is?

41:55.046 --> 41:56.546
This, this school,
this many kids.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.982
Did you know that there were
kids right here

41:58.984 --> 42:01.985
In this country who have never
gone to a school like this?

42:01.987 --> 42:03.520
Who have never had...

42:03.522 --> 42:05.054
Jett, what are you
talking about?

42:05.056 --> 42:07.390
Nothing.

42:07.392 --> 42:09.225
Just enjoying my life.

42:09.227 --> 42:12.228
Well, let's enjoy it
over by our lockers.

42:12.230 --> 42:15.031
Class is about to start.

42:15.033 --> 42:19.035
Jett, your locker's over there.

42:19.037 --> 42:22.739
Do you need me
to show you which one?

42:22.741 --> 42:25.909
No, I know which one.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.419
"traitor."

42:36.421 --> 42:40.924
Well, like I said,
not everyone is as happy

42:40.926 --> 42:43.426
About you quitting
the show as I am.

42:49.034 --> 42:50.567
It seems to be jammed.

42:50.569 --> 42:53.102
Maybe you should use
your combination.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.904
Right.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.073
Hey, what's that?

42:57.075 --> 42:58.741
What's what?

42:58.743 --> 43:01.544
I don't see anything.

43:01.546 --> 43:04.414
What?
What are you
talking about?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.549
Good morning, j.B.

43:06.551 --> 43:08.618
Good morning, kayla.

43:10.055 --> 43:11.554
Kayla.

43:11.556 --> 43:13.256
Good morning, kayla.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.925
Did you say something, j.B.?

43:15.927 --> 43:18.094
No, actually that was jett.

43:18.096 --> 43:22.432
Jett, jett, no,
I don't know any jett.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.267
Why is she ignoring me?

43:24.269 --> 43:26.970
Call it a wild guess,
but it could be

43:26.972 --> 43:29.272
Because you stood her up
at the prom.

43:29.274 --> 43:33.343
And that made you mad?

43:34.913 --> 43:36.412
I'll take that as a yes.

43:36.414 --> 43:37.914
Would it help saying I'm sorry?

43:37.916 --> 43:39.415
Why not say it? We'll see.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.250
I'm sorry.

43:41.252 --> 43:42.752
Nope,

43:42.754 --> 43:44.253
Doesn't help.

43:44.255 --> 43:45.755
You know what?

43:45.757 --> 43:49.258
It's not your fault.
It's my fault.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.427
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

43:51.429 --> 43:54.631
Look, couldn't admit it
for the longest time,

43:54.633 --> 43:56.132
But I liked you.

43:56.134 --> 43:57.934
It's just stupid of me to assume

43:57.936 --> 43:59.636
That you felt the same way.

43:59.638 --> 44:01.838
No, not at all.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.773
Hey, superstar.

44:03.775 --> 44:05.508
Too hot for a tv show, huh?

44:05.510 --> 44:07.010
Let me go.

44:07.012 --> 44:08.778
Or you're going to
do what, exactly?

44:08.780 --> 44:10.279
Let him go, tank.

44:10.281 --> 44:11.781
Quiet.

44:11.783 --> 44:14.951
He hasn't done anything to you.

44:14.953 --> 44:16.452
You know what? He has.

44:16.454 --> 44:19.689
He's done it to me and he's
done it to the whole town.

44:19.691 --> 44:22.325
My parents worked
on that show, man.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.826
Now they don't, and it's

44:23.828 --> 44:25.795
Because of you.

44:25.797 --> 44:29.165
My friend, you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.167
I'm going to count
to three, and you're

44:31.169 --> 44:33.670
Going to be
in a world of pain... one...

44:33.672 --> 44:36.539
I'm shaking.
Two.

44:36.541 --> 44:38.675
Quiver, quiver.

44:42.981 --> 44:44.714
We'll finish this later,
huh, big man?

44:51.990 --> 44:55.224
Maybe school isn't going to be
as much fun as I thought.

45:10.675 --> 45:13.910
Well, it looks like
new york city's still here.

45:13.912 --> 45:16.345
Hey, chicago is called
the windy city.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.047
Maybe it just blew away.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.516
Let's take a look around.

45:20.518 --> 45:23.519
Get it? It blew away.

45:23.521 --> 45:25.388
It's the windy, windy city.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.989
I thought it was funny.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.430
Everything seems normal.

45:34.432 --> 45:37.633
Except that.

45:42.707 --> 45:44.640
Kragg.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.247
This isn't happening.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.883
Welcome to new york.

45:53.885 --> 45:55.752
Ok, it's happening.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.587
I thought I'd give you
a little present

45:57.589 --> 45:59.589
In return for that
gift you gave me.

45:59.591 --> 46:01.090
And what gift was that?

46:01.092 --> 46:05.795
Not only did you disrupt
my work, you left me with...

46:05.797 --> 46:07.964
This.

46:14.739 --> 46:16.606
Ooh...

46:16.608 --> 46:19.609
Pretty, isn't it?

46:19.611 --> 46:21.410
You know miz coretta,
my great-grandmother?

46:21.412 --> 46:23.746
She says that beauty
is only skin deep,

46:23.748 --> 46:25.414
But goodness is to the bone.

46:25.416 --> 46:27.450
I'm sure you're
a great guy inside.

46:27.452 --> 46:30.553
I'm not.
Ok.

46:33.925 --> 46:35.458
You know, doc,

46:35.460 --> 46:37.794
You could make a financial
killing if you took that

46:37.796 --> 46:40.463
Cosmetic cover-up thing
you just did to the open market.

46:40.465 --> 46:41.964
I know some actors who would...

46:41.966 --> 46:44.100
You know, this
cosmetic cover-up

46:44.102 --> 46:48.104
Thing is genetic molecular
trans-dermal regeneration.

46:48.106 --> 46:50.973
It's exactly comments
like that that make living

46:50.975 --> 46:53.142
In this dimension unbearable,

46:53.144 --> 46:55.945
Which is why I'm
creating my own dimension,

46:55.947 --> 46:58.948
One city at a time,
where I'm the ruler,

46:58.950 --> 47:03.286
And everyone,
everyone answers to me.

47:03.288 --> 47:07.123
Someone here wasn't
loved enough as a child.

47:07.125 --> 47:08.624
Yeah, safe to say.

47:08.626 --> 47:11.127
In exactly two minutes,

47:11.129 --> 47:14.797
My new york city will become

47:14.799 --> 47:22.772
Your new home town, a place
where you just can't leave.

47:42.660 --> 47:45.494
Enjoy.

47:45.496 --> 47:47.563
You think he's bluffing?

47:47.565 --> 47:49.832
Not a chance.

47:49.834 --> 47:51.567
Get out, get out of new york.

47:51.569 --> 47:54.070
Get out, get out, get out!

47:54.072 --> 47:56.939
Get out of new york.

47:58.509 --> 48:00.076
This way.

49:38.509 --> 49:41.811
You two may have escaped
my world for now.

49:41.813 --> 49:44.413
But I will see you there.

49:56.995 --> 49:59.829
Oh, no!

49:59.831 --> 50:01.397
Oh, no!

50:02.967 --> 50:06.235
I got to work on my landings.

50:24.989 --> 50:26.889
No sound.

50:26.891 --> 50:29.158
No colour.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.594
No good.

50:33.064 --> 50:36.899
Excuse me, uh, hello, sir.

50:36.901 --> 50:39.335
Is anyone home in there?

50:39.337 --> 50:41.737
Hello, is anyone there?

50:41.739 --> 50:43.739
Anyone home?

50:43.741 --> 50:45.975
Excuse me, can you hear me?

50:47.745 --> 50:50.746
Hello? Hello?

52:02.920 --> 52:05.754
Hey, fellowa, small world.

52:05.756 --> 52:08.491
Didn't I see you
in the other one?

52:11.629 --> 52:15.364
So this is the part
where we fight?

52:31.149 --> 52:34.216
So I guess it's going to be
different than on the show.

53:04.649 --> 53:06.315
Oh, boy!

53:45.590 --> 53:47.756
Where's my stunt double
when I need him?

53:59.203 --> 54:00.769
Thank you.

54:24.095 --> 54:27.763
I did it. I went in, I fought
the bad guys and I got out.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.698
Just like silverstone.

54:31.302 --> 54:37.139
Because I am him.

54:37.141 --> 54:39.275
Yeah, you are.

54:39.277 --> 54:41.043
Let's go.

54:43.581 --> 54:46.315
Hey, hawk, thanks
for waiting for me.

54:46.317 --> 54:48.917
You're thanking
me for something?

54:48.919 --> 54:51.587
You know, this new you?

54:51.589 --> 54:52.755
I may like it after all.

55:00.931 --> 55:02.431
My word child, what's all

55:02.433 --> 55:03.999
The excitement about?

55:04.001 --> 55:06.001
J.B., kayla and I are
riding our bikes

55:06.003 --> 55:09.271
To the creek, and best of all,
we're just going to hang out.

55:09.273 --> 55:11.440
Imagine that.

55:11.442 --> 55:14.777
Yeah, I do have a bike, right?

55:14.779 --> 55:17.446
You mean the one you've
had for three years?

55:17.448 --> 55:19.948
Right, forgot about that?

55:19.950 --> 55:21.784
Don't you think you'd
better call the studio

55:21.786 --> 55:23.786
And see if you
have to work today?

55:23.788 --> 55:28.023
Oh, call the studio, yeah.

55:40.638 --> 55:42.738
Good news,
I'm not working today.

55:54.185 --> 55:56.485
You going somewhere, kiddies?

55:56.487 --> 56:00.489
Oh, gee, hope we're not ruining

56:00.491 --> 56:02.991
Your day or anything like that.

56:02.993 --> 56:05.060
Actually, you are.

56:05.062 --> 56:07.896
I suggest, for your own safety,
that you and your

56:07.898 --> 56:09.398
Little friends run along home.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.734
And what is the
famous jett jackson

56:11.736 --> 56:13.502
Going to do if we don't, huh?

56:13.504 --> 56:15.003
"the famous jett jackson."

56:15.005 --> 56:17.506
Kind of has a nice
ring to it, doesn't it?

56:17.508 --> 56:19.508
J.B., get my jacket.

56:19.510 --> 56:20.909
It's a little warm for...

56:20.911 --> 56:22.411
Get my jacket.

56:22.413 --> 56:23.912
Come on, tank,

56:23.914 --> 56:26.181
We're all sorry
about your parents.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.917
They were working before
jett brought the show here.

56:28.919 --> 56:30.753
I'm sure they'll
find other jobs.

56:30.755 --> 56:35.257
Ooh, now I'm really scared.

56:35.259 --> 56:38.193
The mighty silverstone jacket.

56:38.195 --> 56:40.696
Kayla and j.B., both of you
get out of here.

56:40.698 --> 56:42.264
No, we're not leaving.

56:42.266 --> 56:44.733
Tank, you're being really dumb.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.535
Aww.

56:46.537 --> 56:48.537
Isn't that sweet?

56:48.539 --> 56:52.107
The guy stands you up at prom,
and you still stick up for him.

56:54.945 --> 56:57.913
Come on, boys.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.581
I warned you.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.951
This is a shockwave pod.

57:02.953 --> 57:05.421
It emits an energy field
of 5,000 pounds

57:05.423 --> 57:07.122
Of thrust per square inch.

57:07.124 --> 57:08.724
If you take
another step forward,

57:08.726 --> 57:10.559
I'll be forced to activate it.

57:10.561 --> 57:14.897
Ok, dude, it's a prop
from your show, man.

57:14.899 --> 57:17.599
Ok, you're messed up.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.201
You're messed up.

57:29.747 --> 57:31.814
Ok, this is,

57:31.816 --> 57:33.415
This is getting pathetic.

57:33.417 --> 57:35.417
I'll put you out of your misery

57:35.419 --> 57:37.719
Real quick... everybody
having a good time?

57:39.490 --> 57:40.989
Yes, sir.

57:40.991 --> 57:44.092
Good. Nice game last week, tank.

57:44.094 --> 57:45.994
Hope you stay healthy all year.

57:45.996 --> 57:49.665
Yes, sir,
I will, sir.
Jett,

57:49.667 --> 57:51.667
Anything you need to say?

57:51.669 --> 57:54.169
Nothing.

57:54.171 --> 57:55.671
Good.

57:55.673 --> 57:58.440
Then why don't you all
go on about your business?

57:58.442 --> 58:00.576
Yes, sir.

58:02.313 --> 58:03.946
Oh, jett, the show called.

58:03.948 --> 58:05.447
Said they were
expecting you today.

58:05.449 --> 58:07.616
Seems you have
a few more scenes to shoot?

58:07.618 --> 58:09.618
Must have slipped your mind.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.321
Throw your bike in the back;
I'll give you a lift.

58:12.323 --> 58:15.791
Tell me what was
going on out there?

58:15.793 --> 58:17.292
It was nothing.

58:17.294 --> 58:19.795
Tank and you have been friends
for a long time.

58:19.797 --> 58:21.997
Never had a problem before.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.700
Never cost his parents
a job before.

58:33.844 --> 58:36.812
Son...

58:36.814 --> 58:40.849
No one I know
could have pulled off

58:40.851 --> 58:42.818
What you've done
in the last three years.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.920
No one.

58:46.857 --> 58:50.192
If you say you've had enough,

58:50.194 --> 58:53.228
I know you've had enough.

58:54.565 --> 58:57.966
Thanks... Dad.

59:06.377 --> 59:08.310
Say, "thank you, rat."

59:14.585 --> 59:16.084
The rat!

59:16.086 --> 59:17.586
He must have escaped again.

59:17.588 --> 59:19.187
Thanks, maury.

59:19.189 --> 59:21.056
Rat!

59:21.058 --> 59:23.759
Oh, no!

59:29.433 --> 59:31.533
But he looks so much like a rat.

59:31.535 --> 59:33.535
Right, but he's not.

59:33.537 --> 59:35.537
See, he's an actor,
like yourself.

59:35.539 --> 59:38.540
And right now he's
an actor who wants you

59:38.542 --> 59:40.042
To stay away from him, ok?

59:40.044 --> 59:41.543
Got it, got it.

59:41.545 --> 59:43.612
Good, all right,
let's do rehearsal.

59:46.550 --> 59:48.050
Dude.

59:48.052 --> 59:49.551
What's this for?

59:49.553 --> 59:51.053
Did you not read the revisions?

59:51.055 --> 59:52.554
Revisions?

59:52.556 --> 59:54.056
The new script.
What script?

59:54.058 --> 59:55.557
Just take mine.

59:55.559 --> 59:58.560
Can you say, "burn out"?

59:58.562 --> 01:00:00.395
And... Action.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:01.897
And while checking out new york,

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:04.166
Kragg and his flunkies
appeared out of thin air.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.607
Ahem.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:14.576
Oh, I'm sorry, where are we?

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:17.746
Page 41, scene 41.

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:19.581
All right, let's keep the flow.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.316
Back to ones.

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:23.919
Action.

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:26.154
While checking out new york,
kragg and his flunkies

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.423
Appeared out of thin air.

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:32.260
"and she means out of thin air."

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:33.762
Cut.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:38.600
Oh, my ribs.

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:40.836
Spling, splung...

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:52.948
Ahhh!

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.449
Ha, ha, ha, sorry.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:55.951
I thought you were him.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.452
Who?

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:58.954
Jett.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:01.657
The director needs you on set
to block a fight scene.

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:03.558
Jett's working with
some stuntmen right now.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:13.969
I need to call my agent.

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:15.470
And while checking out new york,

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:16.972
Kragg and his flunkies

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:18.507
Appeared out of thin air.

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:20.008
She means out of thin air...

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.476
With the help of this,

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:22.978
Some sort of molecular key,

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.479
Opens the doorway
between kragg's

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:25.981
Dimension and this one.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:27.683
Excellent, however,
one thing still puzzles me.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:29.685
After chicago, how did
you know new york

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:31.186
Was next on kragg's list?

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:34.322
You told us.

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.992
I did not.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.994
Yes, you did.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.163
You were there with us. Hawk?

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:44.066
It was you.
Ingenious
and daring.

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:45.567
A dangerous combination.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.069
That must have been kragg.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.705
Remember he has the power to
take on anyone's appearance.

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:53.241
If that's true,
then you could still be him.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.743
I could, but I'm not.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:57.045
You think he'd
admit it if it were true?

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.048
This is absurd.
I am me.
Hypnotto made
a doll to

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.583
Hypnotize children...
What was its name?

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:03.185
Plush mr. Puddin'.

01:02:03.187 --> 01:02:05.053
Hawk, silverstone, we're
wasting valuable time.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.556
When silverstone was a baby,
you sang him the same

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:10.525
Song every day... sing it.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:12.027
That was a long time ago.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.595
Sing it.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:17.099
Very well.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:21.937
 The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the water spout 

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:24.740
 down came the rain 

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:26.241
 and washed the spider out 

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.444
 out came the sun
and dried up all the rain 

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.214
 and the itsy-bitsy spider 

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:34.382
 went up the spout again 

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.051
Let go. What are you doing?

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:37.552
Artemus, ask her a question.

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.554
On your birthday,
I gave you a plant.

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:42.057
What did you
name it?
I call it
many things.

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.558
I didn't give you a plant.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.427
You don't water
the ones you have.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.262
So...

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.465
: You
found out my little secret.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:59.207
Well, it won't do you any good.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.848
No, there will be another day,
my young friend.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.417
He came for this.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.486
It must be
of some threat to him.

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:13.722
We need to regroup.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:18.493
What?

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.362
What are you looking at me for?

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:39.347
Nice moon.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.849
Yeah.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:44.452
Back home...

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:48.790
Sometimes,
on warm summer nights...

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:52.794
I'll just sit on the porch.

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:57.833
There'll be a warm breeze
blowing from the west.

01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:02.637
And I look up in the sky...

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:06.374
And there will be the biggest
moon looking back at me.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.783
You're not silverstone, are you?

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.721
I don't know.

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.473
Nice moon.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:44.412
Back home...

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:49.017
Sometimes on
warm summer nights...

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:52.587
I sit on my rooftop
and dream about

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:58.393
What it would be like
to be somewhere else.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:02.597
To just be a kid.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:04.599
To have a family.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:09.104
I know you know.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:13.708
How?

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.278
Child, I was the first person

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:21.216
My great-grandson saw
when he came into this world.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:24.452
He looked right in my eyes...

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:28.890
And I looked into his.

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:31.826
I will never
not know jett jackson.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:41.770
I'm not sure why you're here,
but I know there's a reason.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:46.641
And as long as
you're here, you're family.

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:07.429
Thanks for your help, jb.

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:08.964
You're a good friend.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:12.500
So are you... And, jett,

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:16.438
No matter how dumb
an idea this turns out to be,

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.573
I think it's incredibly cool.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:23.011
Jett, jb.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:25.280
Hey, booker. You need some help?

01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:28.350
No, jb, I think
I can handle it. Thanks.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.821
: There she is.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:34.956
You want me to wait
till booker leaves?

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.559
No. It's now or never.

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:45.300
Hey.

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:46.801
Hey.

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:49.304
Jb called and
said you wanted to see me?

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:50.872
Yeah.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:56.311
You were wrong yesterday
when you said that you were

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:58.480
Foolish to think
that just because you liked me,

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.482
That I felt
the same way about you.

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:02.317
Jett, you don't have to...

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.852
Yes, I do.

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:06.688
I do like you.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:10.358
You do?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.360
Yeah... and
I can't begin to tell you

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.363
How sorry I am
for not making it to the prom.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:18.833
Well, there'll be other dances.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:20.869
I don't want to wait.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:22.370
Jb.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.674
Can I have this dance?

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.910
Here?

01:07:28.912 --> 01:07:30.412
Now?

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:33.081
Here and now.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.753
 Yeah, yeah 

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.255
 been thinking 'bout 

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.891
 you, baby 

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:45.693
 just sitting away 

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:48.763
 watching the days go by 

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.200
 baby, 

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:57.572
 been thinking
'bout you, baby 

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.274
 just sitting away 

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:04.746
 watching the days go by 

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:08.950
 have you ever felt
the breeze hit you hard 

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:10.985
 like the wind... 

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.393
It's open.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.261
Hi.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.296
Hi, mom.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:32.407
I just wanted to come by and see
my baby on his last day of work.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.242
So, it's only been three years,

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.444
But it probably feels like
you've been silverstone forever.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:40.314
You have no idea.

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:42.417
Any regrets?
No.

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:43.917
No regrets.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.920
I've got my family.
I've got my friends.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.156
And I've got
a whole town that hates me.

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:49.991
What more could a kid ask for?

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:53.428
I've got a surprise for you.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.109
We're going to miss you, jett.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:18.086
You're the best, jett jackson.

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:30.965
Congratulations.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:33.134
I don't know
what got into me, man.

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:34.702
My parents straightened me out.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.270
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:40.642
You still the man, jett.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.477
You still the man.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.979
Thanks.

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:47.182
You back to normal now?

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:51.553
Rat!
I guess not.

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.688
His name is maury.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.990
He's an actor too.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:59.661
There's something I forgot
to ask you last night.

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:02.997
Something I want you
to think about.

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:04.499
Sure.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:07.135
If you're here, where's jett?

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.340
Jett!

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.676
We need to talk.
Excuse us. Thanks.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:16.678
The network called
with some changes.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.179
Since this is the last show,

01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:20.848
They want to make it one your
audience will always remember.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:22.350
All I'm going to say is...

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:24.052
It's big.

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.120
The writers are still
working on the ending.

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:34.529
"interior. Artemus' lair."

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.431
"the next morning."

01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:41.636
"the doors open
and silverstone enters."

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:53.047
"he looks around
and sees no one."

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:56.251
"he makes his way
into artemus' main chamber."

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:59.754
"a single red rose sits
in a vase on the table."

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:04.392
"lying next to it
is kragg's dimension key."

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:06.761
"silverstone freezes
as he sees a note"

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.564
"laying under
the dimension key."

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:12.000
"he picks up
the note and reads."

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:16.237
"sivlerstone.
I have hawk and artemus."

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.072
"you have the key."

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:19.774
"you know the way."

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.609
"kragg."

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:26.648
: "silverstone
slams a fist into his palm."

01:11:28.151 --> 01:11:30.418
"silverstone picks up
the dimension key."

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.919
You want me, kragg?

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.922
"you got me."

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:38.293
No. This is a trap.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:41.095
Oh, man.
Silverstone's going to go.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:44.465
But I wouldn't go.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:47.168
But jett...

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:49.771
Jett would.

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:51.339
I have to go back.

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.642
Something wrong?

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:58.112
Jett's in trouble.

01:11:58.114 --> 01:12:00.114
And you're going to help him?

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:03.017
I want to.

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.791
I just don't want to leave.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:11.793
I have everything here.

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:13.294
Friends, family.

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:17.031
You also have
all of that in your world.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:20.635
Friends and family
are where you make them.

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:24.539
You just have to open your eyes

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:27.041
And look around
at what is already there.

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:33.314
I'm going to miss you.

01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:37.118
I'm going to
miss you too, child.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.726
Now, go and find jett.

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.294
Bring him back to us.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:02.276
Be safe.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:17.859
Silverstone.

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.460
Jett.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:23.931
Looking good.

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:25.566
You, too.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.369
Do you have any idea
what's going on in your world?

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:29.871
Kragg's alive.

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:32.039
He's stealing cities, putting
them in his own dimension.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.375
Hawk and artemus
are held hostage,

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:36.644
And you are about
to walk into a trap.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:40.615
I read the script.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:47.955
All except the ending.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:51.125
I'm going to write that myself.

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:56.063
I'm going alone.

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:57.965
No. No way.

01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.467
I'm not going back now.

01:13:59.469 --> 01:14:01.102
Not after I've come this far.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:02.737
You've been incredible.

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:06.107
I was lost,
but I'm not lost any more.

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:09.777
What I was looking for,
I had right here all the time.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:13.414
And as for you...
You belong in wilsted.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.750
Those people...

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:18.119
Those people love you, jett.

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.921
They love <i> you.</i>

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:21.289
Go home.

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:22.790
But, kragg.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.592
I'll handle kragg.

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:28.129
You need to get back and destroy
the time-continuum machine.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.630
Kragg gets this world,

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.500
It's only a matter of time
before he comes for yours.

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:41.943
Hey.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.744
You know how to use that thing?

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:48.282
Right. You read the script.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.918
Jett.

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:53.855
Say hello to nana for me.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.241
I'm home.

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:29.490
Goodbye, silverstone.

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:31.025
Dude!

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.994
What are you doing?

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:34.495
I was just tring to...

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:35.897
Just trying to trash

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.165
My space/time continuum machine.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.667
Cubby, I'll explain later.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.669
You're just going
to have to trust me.

01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:44.572
Dude. Jett-man.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.340
Normally, I would
be right behind you

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:48.743
Venting your rage
on an inanimate object.

01:15:48.745 --> 01:15:53.080
But this baby still
has to play in two more shots.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:58.753
Although I can't really
blame you after reading how

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:01.088
The network plans
to say adios to silverstone.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.590
What are they
going to do to him?

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.392
Kill him off.

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:06.227
What?

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.563
Kragg's going to do
the dirty deed himself.

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:12.099
It starts on page 51.

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:13.901
Here, hold this.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.469
I'll read it to you.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:26.213
"realizing kragg needs
an enormous source"

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:29.250
"of energy to
power his operations,"

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:33.454
"silverstone knew
it could only be one place:"

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:35.289
"the solaropolis power plant."

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:42.563
New york.

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.966
Chicago.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:48.235
London and hong kong.

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:51.238
Just to mention a few.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.107
You're insane.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.743
Perhaps.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:59.647
But there's such
a fine line between genius...

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:02.483
And insanity.

01:17:02.485 --> 01:17:05.753
And someone here seems
to have crossed that line.

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:08.155
Oh. That hurt.

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:13.260
And, I imagine,

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:16.430
So did that.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:19.033
Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:25.006
I have cities to steal.

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:50.297
Could it be?

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:52.366
Is it?

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:58.305
Yes. Yes!

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:00.441
It's paris.

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:11.886
Don't you ever use a door?

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.655
No, I like to drop in whenever
I'm in the neighbourhood.

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:17.725
Stay back. We're in some
sort of electric force field.

01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:27.968
Creative.

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:35.209
Check mate.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.744
Game over. I win.

01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:39.013
All I have to do is push this

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:40.848
Little button and your molecules

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:42.583
Will be scattered
in so many places

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:45.753
It'll take 15 years just
to put together a toenail.

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:51.492
Say bye-bye, silverstone.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.671
There's two of them.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:15.216
Do you have
any idea how I'm supposed

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.717
To turn this thing off?

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:20.621
Oh, I don't know. Why not
try the button that says "off"?

01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:47.047
You find kragg.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:53.454
You didn't destroy the machine?

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:56.457
You wouldn't be asking me that
if I did, now would you?

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:58.793
Touche.

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:00.427
Now lets find us a kragg.

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:03.430
But we're going to talk about
you not listening to me later.

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:06.433
You'd only be
talking to yourself.

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:08.836
Last time I saw kragg
he went this way.

01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.264
Come on.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:14.835
Any luck?

01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:16.337
Nothing here.

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:17.905
Nothing here.

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.768
Oh, my.

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:49.270
One of them's kragg.

01:21:49.272 --> 01:21:51.372
Which one?

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:53.507
It seems we have a problem.

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:12.059
He looked right in my eyes,

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:13.761
And I looked into his.

01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:16.497
I will never
not know jett jackson.

01:22:22.738 --> 01:22:25.339
Problem solved.

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:46.760
Really, guys.

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:49.263
How did you know
who was kragg and who wasn't?

01:22:49.265 --> 01:22:50.931
You all looked the same to me.

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:52.933
He wasn't nearly as
good looking as us.

01:22:52.935 --> 01:22:54.435
And his posture...
It was awful.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:57.471
And his head wasn't as swollen.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:00.107
We just knew he wasn't us.

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:02.142
Congratulations are in order.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.278
Every city is
back to its normal size

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.946
And back to its proper location.

01:23:05.948 --> 01:23:07.815
The world is safe once again.

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.450
Good work, everyone.

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:12.019
I think it's time.
Thank you, artemus.

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:16.190
Thank you, hawk.

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:24.131
Good luck.

01:23:24.133 --> 01:23:26.033
Artemus.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:36.810
I missed you.

01:23:36.812 --> 01:23:40.314
Yes, I...

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:42.549
I missed you, too.

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:47.321
Hawk.

01:23:47.323 --> 01:23:49.556
There's work to be done.

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:53.327
But I thought
you said the world was safe.

01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:55.562
For the time being.

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:06.673
You know, after you go through,
I have to destroy it.

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:08.675
And what's up with hugging hawk?

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:10.577
She's nice...
We sat on

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:12.079
The roof together, that's all.

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:13.580
My roof.

01:24:13.582 --> 01:24:17.084
You sat on my roof. I didn't
sit on any roof with kayla.

01:24:17.086 --> 01:24:19.853
Kayla? You hung out with kayla?

01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.722
We didn't really hang out.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:23.223
But I did give her

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:24.725
That dance you owed her.

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.361
You danced with kayla?
But the prom was...

01:24:27.363 --> 01:24:29.663
It wasn't at school.
It was at jb's store.

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:33.267
I'm ruined.

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:34.768
No, man.

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:37.104
We had a really great time.
It's a good thing,

01:24:37.106 --> 01:24:39.039
Especially after
I got the show cancelled.

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:40.908
Cancelled?

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:43.577
Oh, man. I don't think
I want to go back.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:45.612
Any chance artemus
needs another full-time agent.

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:49.049
But seriously...

01:24:49.051 --> 01:24:51.718
What you have here...

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.388
What you do here...

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:55.889
It's pretty cool.

01:24:55.891 --> 01:24:57.391
Yeah.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.726
Hey, you got it
pretty good, too.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:02.429
I know.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.231
It's like I was
blaming everyone else

01:25:04.233 --> 01:25:05.933
For not seeing who I really was,

01:25:05.935 --> 01:25:08.168
When it was me who
was afraid to look.

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:12.906
Being here has
really opened my eyes.

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:17.144
I'm jett. And I'm silverstone.

01:25:17.146 --> 01:25:19.746
I don't need
to choose between the two.

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:21.448
No, you don't.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:24.418
So, I'll be seeing you, jett.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.322
And me, you. Every time
we look in the mirror.

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:47.341
Hi, jett.

01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:58.619
Jett?

01:25:58.621 --> 01:26:00.154
Artemus?

01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:01.788
Just on the set.

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:05.292
Out here, I'm nigel.

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:11.465
Good to see you, nigel.
Good to see you.

01:26:11.467 --> 01:26:13.800
Yes. I can see that.

01:26:13.802 --> 01:26:15.903
Hey, rat.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.140
He's still whacked.
Let me through.

01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:23.177
Excuse me, pardon me.

01:26:23.179 --> 01:26:26.480
Good to see you, man.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:27.981
Nana.

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:29.683
Welcome home, jett.

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:34.321
Nana, you won't believe
what happened to me. I...

01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:35.822
I know, child.

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:38.392
I know.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:55.676
Hi.

01:26:55.678 --> 01:26:57.344
Hi.

01:26:57.346 --> 01:27:00.514
Jett. I've been
looking all over for you.

01:27:00.516 --> 01:27:02.015
Everybody's waiting
to hear your statement.

01:27:02.017 --> 01:27:03.550
The press is all over me

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.920
To explain your decision...

01:27:13.062 --> 01:27:15.262
All right, plunkett.
Break it up, break it up.

01:27:15.264 --> 01:27:18.699
I don't want anyone changing my
son's mind. What's done is done.

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:21.702
No. No it's not. Excuse me.

01:27:21.704 --> 01:27:23.437
Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:27.241
Listen up, everyone.

01:27:27.243 --> 01:27:30.544
I want to thank you all
for coming out.

01:27:30.546 --> 01:27:32.045
I have something to say.

01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:35.582
Being silverstone
makes my life crazy...

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.084
It makes it confusing...

01:27:37.086 --> 01:27:38.585
It makes it tiring.

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:42.789
And I wouldn't
have it any other way.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:46.760
So, for as long as you want me,
you got silverstone.
