WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:03.800
The following programme
contains graphic images.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.920
Shit!

01:34.360 --> 01:36.680
Yeah.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.640
Sorry to wake you, Boss.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.200
Er, let me just—
close the window.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.520
We've got a live fire at the
Islamic Centre on Mayman Street.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.680
Police are worried
it could be a hate crime.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.680
Who's in charge?

01:52.400 --> 01:53.760
You don't wanna know.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.680
Thanks a lot!
Not my job, mate.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.280
That's my fiancé!
Hey, go easy! She's OK.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.400
Where is he?
He was trapped in the kitchen.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.840
I tried, babe...

02:42.880 --> 02:44.120
I really tried.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.160
Who's the 'he'?
Abdullah! My brother. He's the Imam.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.360
Look, hey, hey! I'll find
out what happened to him.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.920
I'll go and find out
what happened to him.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.120
What's going on?
I promise. Please. OK?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.960
You cannot be here.
I'll come find you.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.360
Alright. We'll be at my café, yeah?
Shakes

03:01.400 --> 03:02.760
Over there.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.600
Come on, Sis. Come on.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.760
He got here quick.
And what's he come as?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.840
What is he doing?
Anything he wants to apparently

03:10.880 --> 03:12.760
Morning Boss! Oh!

03:13.880 --> 03:16.200
So, where's... Steve and...?

03:16.240 --> 03:19.480
Steve's on his way.
Course we're a man down.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.240
You know, I'm all for letting down
the ladder after me

03:22.280 --> 03:23.880
as long as snakes
aren't climbing up.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.200
It's OK to not like someone, Maggy.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.280
I didn't like my daughter until
she could use the toilet.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.920
Er, you can take that off now!

03:32.960 --> 03:34.440
The fire's out, Jan. Let us in.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.160
Not a chance.
We're awaiting engineering.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.600
What?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.400
If the action's round the back,
try using the front.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.640
Ha!

04:26.320 --> 04:27.840
Wolfe?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.600
Wolfe... Can you hear me?

04:32.360 --> 04:34.640
Come on mate, come on.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.840
- Mags!
- No, it's me.

04:39.880 --> 04:45.000
Wolfe? Wolfe, where are you?

04:45.040 --> 04:48.360
I'm in... in the mosque.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.360
What are you playing at?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.480
Boss, tell me what can you see?
Really?

04:52.520 --> 04:54.240
What? He's already in there.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.480
It...

04:57.000 --> 05:00.440
It looks like the fridge
is the seat of the fire.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.840
What else?

05:01.880 --> 05:04.760
My life flashing before my eyes.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.400
Pornhub really dominates
the latter years.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.360
Get out. Now!

05:14.800 --> 05:16.280
Right, what was that?

05:16.320 --> 05:17.560
Judgement day.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.200
Wolfe?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.440
Wolfe!

05:23.480 --> 05:24.880
Wolfe!

05:25.920 --> 05:27.240
I'm OK.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.840
More than I can say for the Imam.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.240
Get out of there, Wolfe!
Shift your arse, now!

05:39.280 --> 05:41.600
Can you indicate what part
of the building you're in?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.120
I'm trying!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.680
Wolfe!

06:15.800 --> 06:19.280
I give up.
You lot are co-dependent.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.280
Off his meds, off his heads?
Looks like it.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.040
Are we going to talk to him
about it?

06:24.080 --> 06:27.840
Abso-fucking-lutely not.
Well, not until you have to.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.760
You OK?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.280
I'm alright. I'm just
going across the road.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.240
Let me push you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.320
That's kind of you. Thank you.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.200
Here. It's the best I've got, sorry.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.920
I smelt the smoke,

07:00.960 --> 07:04.240
then opened the kitchen door,
and it was an inferno.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.280
Just couldn't get to him.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.440
I feel like a coward.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.360
Door handles?

07:17.760 --> 07:21.640
Imperfect action is better
than perfect inertia.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.440
Here he is.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.200
Sorry.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.120
My brother, my brother's dead.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.840
You could've died, too,
trying to save him.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.680
I can't believe he's not here.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.640
That's my entire family, Haroon!

07:51.680 --> 07:54.000
Zara, that's not true.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.480
First trimester?

07:56.520 --> 07:59.600
No, I'm four months gone.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.280
Abdullah was going to be an uncle.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.560
He'd be really proud of you.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.720
"We belong to Allah,
and to Him do we return."

08:09.760 --> 08:13.680
But I'll bet we're allowed
to wave back now and again.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.880
If he is, he won't be waving.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.640
I didn't tell him.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.680
I said I'd do it next month,

08:23.720 --> 08:27.200
when I'd put distance between us,
for his reputation.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.120
OK? Cheers, bro.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.200
We're moving to Pakistan
on Wednesday.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.160
Haroon? I found some shoes
for you, in the back.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.440
You Muslim?

08:35.480 --> 08:36.880
Lapsed.

08:36.920 --> 08:39.440
Well, phase three, in fact.
I packed it in.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.360
Oh, great. Another kafir.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.800
Jamal!

08:44.560 --> 08:47.480
So, what happens today, then?

08:48.680 --> 08:50.560
Do we send undertakers for him?

08:50.600 --> 08:53.040
The body still needs
to be formally identified.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.680
We go to dental and DNA
in these kinds of cases.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.320
Will that take long?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.560
I'm not in charge of the case,
I'm afraid. Just the science.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.120
I'm- I'm sorry for your loss.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.680
But congratulations.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.560
Another day in paradise.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.600
Are we sure it's safe to be in here
considering the boss nearly choked?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.560
What are the footprints saying?

09:23.600 --> 09:26.240
Can't see the wood from the
Fire Service shoes at the minute.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.080
I've got one of Wolfe's footprints

09:29.120 --> 09:32.400
and then out there, I've got
bare feet from the worshippers.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.200
Does anyone fancy
- giving me a hand?
- No.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.320
There's nothing... nothing!
I miss the dogs.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.720
That thing's worth a year's salary.
Even yours.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.480
Right, what d'you reckon?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.440
Nowhere near damaged enough
to cause the fire.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.040
That doesn't mean it shouldn't
be checked. CCTV?

09:53.080 --> 09:55.000
I've searched the building, no dice.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.160
Well, what do we know?

09:56.200 --> 10:00.160
Based off the burn patterns
to the floors and overhead...

10:00.200 --> 10:02.160
You were right about the seat.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.040
Let's get it to base, get it tested.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.880
Belts, braces, all the traces.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.040
Just to be clear,
we're eliminating hate crime?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.200
We're not eliminating,
but's it low down on the list.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.280
There's no hate messages,
no messages at all.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.960
Was the Imam was well liked?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.800
It's hard to hear a bad word.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.520
Ran a food bank, community
outreach, and got a recording booth

10:24.560 --> 10:25.680
built for the youth club.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.880
But when you say
'It's hard to hear a bad word.'

10:27.920 --> 10:30.400
Some called him a moral extortioner,

10:30.440 --> 10:33.280
and someone accused him
of misappropriating mosque funds.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.760
Is that embezzlement?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.840
No, he blew it on the youth club
recording studio.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.320
And what do we know about the
fella who discovered the fire?

10:40.360 --> 10:43.360
Haroon was about to become
brother-in-law to Abdullah.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.680
He's a community lawyer.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.520
Immigration mainly, but he
covers general law pro-bono

10:47.560 --> 10:50.480
two afternoons a week.
You're wearing different lipstick.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.040
I'm wearing none.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.480
That really suits you.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.360
I had no say in it, but thanks.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.760
I've bagged up the trainers
from the shoe rack.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.680
They need running for prints.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.960
Will do.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
So weird.
Dominique's left me on read.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.000
Wonder what's she
stropping about now!

11:25.280 --> 11:27.000
Has something happened?

11:28.440 --> 11:30.080
You need to ask Dot.

11:31.240 --> 11:35.080
Maggy, if you know what Dot knows,
then just tell me now.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.640
Your girlfriend was
only here to shove Wolfe

11:39.680 --> 11:43.040
and the rest of us under a bus,
including you.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.680
What?

11:45.720 --> 11:48.760
She was trying to free her jailbird
mum by discrediting Wolfe.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.200
At any cost.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.880
I'm not decent.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.040
If it's a parcel,
leave it next door please.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.200
You need to open the door,
Dominique.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.760
So, that is the only reason
that you came to work here?

12:20.800 --> 12:23.960
It's the only reason
I took forensic science.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.080
Becoming a GP
wasn't going to save her.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.440
So, you couldn't get to Wolfe
without banging me?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.160
I got the job on credible merit.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.800
Yeah, but it helped to have me
on the board

12:31.840 --> 12:34.400
at your first round of interviews,
no?

12:34.440 --> 12:36.840
So, what was I? Was I 'Mr. Backup'?

12:46.240 --> 12:48.480
For three months, Dominique,
I have been walking on air

12:48.520 --> 12:51.600
because I thought that you
actually saw something in me.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.880
You!

13:01.480 --> 13:04.400
I don't expect you to believe this

13:06.360 --> 13:08.720
but my feelings for you are real.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.320
No, do not come near me.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.760
I never said a word
about the two of you.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.760
We can talk about all of it
or none of it after work.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.200
But if you're staying,
I need you focused.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.200
The capacitor's melted
and the wiring's damaged.

14:14.240 --> 14:19.000
No PAT test tag, and to top it all,
this serial number's a recall model.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.440
But let's test the ashes.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.600
Belt and braces, like the man said.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.040
Er, who's doing DNA and prints?

14:27.080 --> 14:30.760
That would be you, also, as I'll
be getting the boss off the ledge.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.840
Or you could just push him.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.840
When they lifted the body, there was
variable scorch marks in the lino.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.560
Porous surfaces retain
traces of accelerants.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.520
What, underneath the body?

14:52.760 --> 14:55.800
The electro sniffer went batshit.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.800
Whoa! Woo-hoo hoo hoo!

15:00.840 --> 15:04.000
Guy Fawkes! Guy Fawkes!

15:04.040 --> 15:06.000
What does this mean?

15:06.040 --> 15:07.640
- Er... Arson.
- Yeah, arson.

15:07.680 --> 15:12.160
So, DCI Betsy Chambers's
turn to going batshit next!

15:18.200 --> 15:20.480
Now, am I paying for these
out of petty cash,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.840
because it is full of my IOUs?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.920
Actually, they're on me.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.360
At what cost?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
Wolfe's not himself.

15:28.640 --> 15:32.040
No, no, no! Knock mine
off whatever you owe me.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.320
Yeah, and mine.
Will you please just let me finish?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.120
Not if you know what's good for you.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.440
You just saw the state of him.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, but I also saw the results.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
Look, if we're not going
to confront him about it-

15:41.080 --> 15:42.720
OK, that's another no.
Don't say 'we'!

15:42.760 --> 15:45.440
Then we need to be checking.
I don't mean checking his work,

15:45.480 --> 15:47.840
I mean checking the legitimacy
of his process.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.400
- I just heard the phone!
- Oh!

15:49.440 --> 15:51.760
Yeah, I think it's from me,
actually.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.520
Maggy! You're becoming
the shadow I can't shake.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.040
I dropped by to rush
through the post-mortem.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.480
Should have known you'd be on it.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.560
He promised me a steak dinner.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.080
I'm surprised you're not vegan.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.040
There's soot particles staining
the tongue and the pharynx.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.920
Goes as far as the glottis.
So, death by smoke inhalation.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.840
I've yet to test
the carboxyhaemoglobin

16:18.880 --> 16:20.240
or examine the distal airways.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
Looks like burst blood
vessel in the right eye?

16:22.320 --> 16:24.800
I think you're right.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.520
- Sorry.
- Maxine, Maxine!

16:27.560 --> 16:30.520
I've got to take this.
Mum? Oh, no!

16:30.560 --> 16:33.280
Who's the third party? Parties?

16:33.320 --> 16:34.600
What hospital are they in?

16:34.640 --> 16:37.520
That's going to take a while.
Well, you sound OK. Where are you?

16:37.560 --> 16:39.440
What the actual fuck?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.080
Bruv!

16:44.320 --> 16:46.360
See! The hyoid bone is broken.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.160
Somebody strangled Abdullah,
fracturing his hyoid bone,

16:49.200 --> 16:51.760
causing the blood vessel
to burst in his right eye.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.880
- So, he was murdered.
- That's right.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.800
Can you keep an eye on Maxine
whilst I clear up?

16:56.840 --> 16:58.040
Yeah.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.200

17:41.240 --> 17:44.040

18:13.520 --> 18:15.920
Hey! Anything on the vape?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.920
We only managed to retrieve
a partial print from the vape.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.480
But it's quite distinctive, though.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.800
Great. When's Betsy getting here?
Actually, that’s not the best bit.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.960
I managed to pull a print
from the trainers

18:27.000 --> 18:30.080
that I found at the crime scene.
And... look.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.120
Nice diagonal scar. DNA?
Tons of it.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.680
But we're still no closer because
the print's not on the database.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.600
The suspect has no prior.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.880
So, it's definitely murder?
Yes. Death by strangulation.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.360
Brilliant. So, we're gonna
get hate crime headlines?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.480
- Brilliant!
- Unlikely, OK?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.520
Someone tried to make
this look like an accident.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.600
The other mob, they would've
claimed responsibility.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.360
Abdullah had a series
of run-ins with Jamal.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.520
He'd publicly objected to Jamal's
café licence because of drug use.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.880
Were they warranted?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.080
He'd been charged a few times,
but never convicted.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.200
So, his prints aren't on file?
Yeah, but does he have an alibi?

19:04.240 --> 19:06.640
Intruder alarm and witnesses
confirm he opened up the café

19:06.680 --> 19:08.160
for breakfast orders after the
mosque.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.480
So? That's like 90 seconds
away from the crime scene!

19:10.520 --> 19:13.040
Erm, are we done?

19:28.040 --> 19:31.240
No, no, no.
This is an invitation-only event.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.320
Look, I need to ask
the community for help.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.600
More help, in working out
what happened to Abdullah.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.200
Are you drunk?
What's going on?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.120
What difference would a day make?

19:40.160 --> 19:43.040
I needed to come when most of his
friends were in the same place.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.720
I can't smell booze,
but something's not right.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.920
You should go.
Abdullah was murdered!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.360
What?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.240
This is seriously
inappropriate behaviour.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.280
You shouldn't be here.
If that's even true,

19:59.320 --> 20:00.920
today was about remembering
his life.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.000
Meanwhile, somebody's getting
away with taking it.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.280
What, and you're looking at me?

20:05.320 --> 20:08.600
I didn't open my mouth, but
who contested your shop licence

20:08.640 --> 20:11.200
three years running
for drug activity?

20:12.520 --> 20:14.200
I'm either calling
the police or a doctor.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.000
I am a doctor.
Fuck it. It's police.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.680
Zara, Zara, Zara, Zara!

20:20.720 --> 20:23.040
How was he murdered?

20:23.080 --> 20:25.240
I'm not at liberty to disclose.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.120
Oh, but you're fine
breaking this to me in public?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.280
Look, I shouldn't have come.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.600
I realise that now,
but this community

20:32.640 --> 20:35.200
is resistant to cooperation
at the best of times.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.920
You've just made it ten
times worse, haven't you?

20:37.960 --> 20:40.040
I need a senior officer
to call me back.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.480
You need help, Professor.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.680
That's what I've been
trying to tell them, OK?

20:43.720 --> 20:47.560
I just need an exact list of everyone

20:47.600 --> 20:50.480
that was in that mosque on that day.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.400
Will you help with the community?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.400
It's weird.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.440
The ashes in the fridge
have the usual suspects,

20:58.480 --> 21:01.320
but there's also elastane
and acrylic.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.040
Possibly for a wick?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.320
No, elastane and acrylic is socks.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.560
Did any socks come
- with the trainers?
- No.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.040
Maybe he used both as wicks?

21:11.080 --> 21:13.400
Whatever, this literally
stinks of an improv.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.440
This is not pre-meditated.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.480
Hand sanitizer and socks.

21:18.400 --> 21:22.280
Aha! Where's the Boss
when you want to show off, eh?

21:25.960 --> 21:27.840
Now we're talking!

21:27.880 --> 21:29.800
♪ Little shopping bags in a row

21:29.840 --> 21:31.160
♪ In a row, in a row. ♪

21:31.200 --> 21:34.080
Dad, cut it out!
Where have you been?

21:34.120 --> 21:35.400
My legs aren't in it, Dad.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.240
We need to sit down and
eat something, or go home.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.520
Look!

21:39.560 --> 21:42.880
These were in the shop window,
and they're exactly my size.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.520
That's alignment, right?

21:44.560 --> 21:46.520
They just popped in and out,
two seconds.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.360
I find it helps to make lists.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.640
Did you just say that to me?

21:51.680 --> 21:54.880
I just meant...
lists curb my overspending.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.280
I think we tried one, once.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.240
Oh, Flick!
We forgot the Apple store!

22:02.280 --> 22:04.680
No, Dad, please! I don't—
We've still got 15 minutes.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.520
I don't need anything else.

22:06.560 --> 22:10.560
Have you no more adrenaline
in those legs, Milady?

22:10.600 --> 22:13.680
Why, no, Sire. You've taken the lot!

22:14.640 --> 22:16.840
- Come on!

You were a lot less polite.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.680
All of that is going back!

22:37.720 --> 22:40.240
Mum! I tried to talk to him-

22:40.280 --> 22:41.520
Wolfe...

22:44.040 --> 22:46.520
Your Dad's not feeling well.
I know, I cottoned on too late.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.960
- I can tell.
- Hey, I could
be dripping in iPads now.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.240
Do you understand the level-
Flick, I'm kidding!

22:51.280 --> 22:53.200
I got it!

22:56.840 --> 22:57.840
OK.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.480
- Do you remember this song?
- Yeah!

23:04.840 --> 23:07.560
Your mum and me to this song.

23:09.240 --> 23:14.000
Your mother and me, took coke
together for the first time.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.920
Jesus Christ, Wolfe!

23:15.960 --> 23:18.080
HE... thought it was coke

23:18.120 --> 23:20.480
but the idiot was snorting
Beecham's powder

23:20.520 --> 23:22.560
when I was in the loo.
She'll tell you anything!

23:24.400 --> 23:25.800
OK.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.480
Mmm!

23:35.920 --> 23:37.520
- Oh!
- Dad!

23:37.560 --> 23:39.240
- Wolfe!
- Daddy!

23:39.280 --> 23:41.400
-- Waa!
- OK.
- Bloody hell, Val.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.280
Can you please channel some of the
affection you used to have for me?

23:45.320 --> 23:48.920
I am. I am thinking
about our wedding night.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.840
I'm sorry. Sorry.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.040
You don't half piss me off.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.040
When was the last time
you took your meds?

24:02.080 --> 24:04.960
I am taking my meds.
I've got a big case.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.520
Lithium?

24:06.560 --> 24:09.000
They numb me, Val, OK?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.040
It's like watching my life on TV

24:11.080 --> 24:14.520
except we're at your Dad's house
and there's shit reception.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.120
Showing your age.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
- I can't.
- OK.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.400
- I can't do this.
- OK.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.920
OK. Just...

24:26.960 --> 24:29.440
Please... Hmm?..tread lightly.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.840
-- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.440
I better go.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.480
Sorry! Thank you. Thank you.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.520
I um...

24:44.400 --> 24:45.600
Nah.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.920
You know if you... if you...

24:53.960 --> 24:57.920
woulda come to me in the first place
and told me your truth,

24:57.960 --> 25:00.160
I'd have backed you to the hilt.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.760
We could have investigated
your mum's case together.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
Who'd trust anyone with
that kind of information

25:05.840 --> 25:07.560
before they knew them properly?

25:08.320 --> 25:10.800
Well, I've never discussed
my childhood with anyone

25:10.840 --> 25:13.720
since I left home, so...

25:13.760 --> 25:15.320
What does 'properly' mean?

25:17.160 --> 25:19.280
I'm so sorry I hurt you, Steve.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.760
Y'know, the guys I normally
go for aren't your type...

25:26.680 --> 25:29.200
and they're never that pale.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.720
But I did.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.960
Yeah, as bait.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.520
After that.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.920
Unfilled prescriptions?
Yeah, going back months.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.520
Alright, Maggy, for your record,
I take it back.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.400
He has never historically
been this stupid.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.480
He's just been seen coming
through the main foyer.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.000
For my sake, do not fuck the bear.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.800
- Go, go, go, go!
- Alright!

26:05.840 --> 26:07.760
And that's my point.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.160
You've never seen him this bad
- before?
- No, I said 'stupid'.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.040
He has been this bad before,
but not without his meds.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.680
What did you do then?
Well, I... covered his back.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.200
Which is a little bit not-like
and completely opposite to

26:18.240 --> 26:19.600
'watching his arse'!

26:19.640 --> 26:21.440
And what did he mean by
'for my sake'?

26:21.480 --> 26:23.800
Have you checked the vape
from the crime scene for drugs?

26:23.840 --> 26:26.640
Er, yeah, it's clear.
- Boss, can I have a word?
- Shoot.

26:26.680 --> 26:30.600
Um, I wanted to talk-
I think you should rehire Dominique.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.560
I think you should stop
thinking with your dick.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.120
Leave it, eh, Steve?
No, I have to try.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.840
Try what?
I don't know how to say this,

26:35.880 --> 26:38.040
but this investigation is
totally shoot from the hip.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.480
Are you sure you didn't drop
the ball all those years ago?

26:40.520 --> 26:42.360
You know what I hate Steve? Liars!

26:42.400 --> 26:44.960
She didn't... lie.
Ah! "Alternative facts."

26:45.000 --> 26:47.840
OK, Boss, you bang on about
how we deal in certainties.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.000
Oh, so you do listen!

26:49.040 --> 26:51.200
You're a great teacher,
so why don't you teach Dominique?

26:51.240 --> 26:52.840
Because she doesn't have facts,
Boss.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.040
She has doubts and she does
not deserve to be this tormented.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.200
Give her another shot Boss or—
Don't say it.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.800
Or what?

26:59.840 --> 27:01.200
Or I will leave as well.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.080
- Ooh! I accept.
- You do?

27:03.120 --> 27:05.360
I accept your resignation.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.240
Wow! I didn't know I
was meant to be here.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.280
How did you?

27:18.320 --> 27:21.240
We checked two others
before this.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.720
I thought I was coming
to charge you,

27:23.760 --> 27:27.000
but I persuaded Haroon Waseem
to withdraw a formal complaint.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.480
Who's 'we'?

27:43.000 --> 27:47.320
Salary, Sanity, Surveillance.
MI6-6-6.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.280
Oh, now it's The Incredibles!

27:50.880 --> 27:53.200
I was forced to come,
but I could've been asked.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.720
Don't be a dick, Wolfe.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.240
You're scaring the people who
evidently care about you the most.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.960
You're the least scared-looking
people I've ever seen.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.720
Nobody's ganging up on you Wolfe,

28:02.760 --> 28:04.560
but we all think your
behaviour is well-off!

28:04.600 --> 28:06.160
Pfft!

28:06.200 --> 28:08.320
We found unfilled prescriptions
in your office drawer.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.800
You've gone through my drawers?
Wolfe, stop.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.000
You lied about being on the meds.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.440
Your behaviour in a post-mortem
was...

28:16.480 --> 28:19.360
..hyper, reckless and...

28:19.400 --> 28:20.920
(DISTORTED VOICE)..illegal.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.840
You bulldozed a funeral.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.120
It was a 'matham'.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.120
And you just went and fired Steve.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.280
Fuck Steve.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.440
We're all speaking as individuals.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.240
Can I say,

28:35.280 --> 28:37.280
How much I respect your time
and patience with me,

28:37.320 --> 28:39.240
and for having the guts
for a confrontation. Ah?

28:39.280 --> 28:42.480
We just need you to stop bombing-off
behind everybody's backs.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.000
Wolfe what're doing?
I can't stand blood, fresh blood.

28:52.320 --> 28:57.120
Be my guest. Test it. Test it!

28:57.160 --> 29:01.200
The prescriptions you found
are for standby,

29:01.240 --> 29:02.800
but they expired.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.360
Last month's was filled.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
It takes three weeks for
the meds to take effect,

29:06.440 --> 29:09.280
but they're a week overdue.
I've filed some complaints.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.200
Welcome to my world, ladies.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.800
I have work to do.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.760
Is that Zara Alfridi?

29:25.560 --> 29:27.920
Go and find out.
I shouldn't even be here.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.120
Wherever we go next,
I'm gonna need a proper drink,

29:30.160 --> 29:33.080
otherwise I'm gonna feign
fainting for a brandy.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.880
This is nearly everyone
at dawn prayers.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
I can't do early prayers
without chucking up,

29:39.960 --> 29:43.440
and there's a few
other names missing,

29:43.480 --> 29:46.880
but I've got the word out,
and people are signing-up.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.320
These are already sensitive people,
y'know?

29:50.360 --> 29:54.040
I'm guessing one of them wasn't,
Zara.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.440
That's why we need their prints.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.400
They won't consent to digital
versions going into the system.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.360
Fine. We're famed for
our work with ink on paper.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.720
They get automatically
destroyed within a month

30:03.760 --> 30:05.120
once they're ruled out.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.200
Uh-uh.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.960
You rule them out on the day,
and you destroy them on the day.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.160
I can guarantee that.
We've got shredders.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.080
Or you can bring your own fire.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.120
I'm so sorry.
That was really bad taste.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.680
Don't you need someone else's
permission to make that work?

30:17.720 --> 30:21.320
Oh, categorically yeah,
but they rarely say no to me.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.640
Well, let's see who turns up then.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.280
Who the hell said-

30:41.320 --> 30:43.080
You can't swear at a mosque.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.320
Who in their right mind agrees
to destroy print evidence?

30:46.360 --> 30:48.840
It's 101 for CID, 'keep everything'.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.280
Yeah and I'm not happy about
the sister of the victim being

30:51.320 --> 30:52.960
here to supervise a process.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.720
The community asked Zara to shred
the cards the minute we're done.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.480
But what if we get a hit and have
to hold back for obvious reasons?

30:59.520 --> 31:02.080
Redact the names before
- we hand them back.
- Yeah.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.200
Well, whatever he's done, he's
brought 'em in, so, good on him.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.040
Till he opens his mouth again.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.280
I'd better go and introduce myself.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.840
Alsalaamu alaikum.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.400
Wa-alaikum alsalaam.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends of Abdullah.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.440
Which is why we're all here.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.800
My name is Professor Wolfe Kinteh.

31:18.840 --> 31:22.400
And what we need you to do today
will take less than 20 minutes.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.280
If the gentlemen line up
and go to that desk,

31:25.320 --> 31:27.320
and the ladies line up
and go to that desk,

31:27.360 --> 31:28.760
please leave your fingerprints.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.000
After which, Zara Alfridi will
take care of your information,

31:32.040 --> 31:33.920
as requested.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.880
That is, unless your prints
create cause for concern.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.080
If you've nothing to hide,
you've nothing to fear.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.320
After this process-

31:41.360 --> 31:43.120
After this process,

31:43.160 --> 31:46.760
could you please take the positions
you occupied on the day, please?

31:46.800 --> 31:48.720
I'm DCI Betsy Chambers,

31:48.760 --> 31:51.160
and I'm actually in charge
of the investigation.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.120
Any questions, I'll be over there.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.600
- OK.
- Thank you.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.480
Thank you.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.000
Thank you very much.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.040
Anything?

32:22.080 --> 32:23.760
Nothing even close.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.680
There's four spaces.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.520
Faisal didn't want to come,
full stop.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.440
Yeah, and Mo's got the squits.
We don't want him here.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.520
Listen, they were both driving
school buses by seven that day.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.560
What about Haroon?

32:58.600 --> 33:00.720
Well, I left him packing
but he said he was gonna-

33:00.760 --> 33:02.720
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.280
I've loaded the car.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.720
Whenever you're ready, we can
head straight to the airport.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.040
Just because it says three hours
before departure,

33:10.080 --> 33:11.520
nobody actually does.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.440
The excess baggage alone is
gonna keep us busy for an hour.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.360
How can I help?

33:17.400 --> 33:20.360
Can you join the congregation
where you stood that morning?

33:30.320 --> 33:32.080
That's where he was.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.480
We need your prints.
Will you come with me?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.760
Just need to get my shoes.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.840
Take your time. I need mine too.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.080
Last one.

33:50.680 --> 33:51.880
All done.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.240
- No.
- Hmm?

34:07.360 --> 34:10.520
Who's number four?
Ahh, it was Osman.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.760
Osman Choudhary. Lives in
the Cranberry Hill estate.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.400
Get me the address, get us a
warrant, and send me back-up.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.920
In that order.

34:19.440 --> 34:23.200
Hey. For your information,
I've been clean for over four years.

34:23.240 --> 34:25.440
Is 'clean' the word,
when you supply kids?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.320
I've seen the state
of some of your customers.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.120
If they turn up wasted,
they're looking for somewhere safe.

34:30.160 --> 34:34.720
Abdullah knew that, but he thought
I encouraged 'a process'.

34:34.760 --> 34:38.240
Whether he was right or wrong,
won't change my position, Professor.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.640
We don't sell them anything.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.080
They don't even want water.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.000
It's now or never.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.120
No, Haroon, it's not happening!

34:49.160 --> 34:50.840
Zara—I'm not going.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.480
We went to a lot of trouble
to get the house in both names.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.040
We both have to be there on
signature, for crying out loud!

34:56.080 --> 34:58.400
I want that little shit, Osman,
strung up.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.120
The only thing Abdullah
ever did wrong

35:00.160 --> 35:02.280
was making that shifty
little bastard feel welcome!

35:02.320 --> 35:04.600
Hey, hey, Zara. Calm down.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.880
Having a name does not mean
evidence.

35:06.920 --> 35:09.960
And even if it did,
that court case is a long way off.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Thank you for today.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.160
Take your flight and do
something nice for yourself.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.240
I'll personally keep you informed.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.440
I warned him about exactly this.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.440
That coulda been a lynch mob.
Come on. I want you with me.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.440
What do I tell him?

35:25.480 --> 35:28.360
Wolfe! She's coming with me. Yeah?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.520
Zara!

35:33.560 --> 35:35.160
In the meantime,

35:35.200 --> 35:39.000
Abdullah stays within
my care as evidence

35:39.040 --> 35:41.240
until we get the job finished.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.880
Thank you.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.000
Dot, Dot, Dot!

35:58.040 --> 35:59.240
Wolfe, Wolfe, Wolfe!

35:59.280 --> 36:01.840
It's your fault half
the staff aren't here.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.080
What you thinking?

36:07.120 --> 36:10.840
That was very straightforward.
What are you thinking?

36:12.080 --> 36:14.040
Never is, though.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.040
How do you cope with the sound?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.480
I actually find it relaxing.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.080
I forget, they're usually always
dead by the time you lot show up.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.160
- Go round the back.
- Yes, Ma'am.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.560
Osman Choudhary, this is the police
with a warrant for your arrest.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.040
Osman!

36:40.800 --> 36:42.000
Police!

36:56.240 --> 36:57.960
Suddenly, it's my show.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.560
How do you know?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.920
Purple face, Betsy?

37:05.320 --> 37:08.280
The Imam finished morning prayers.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.720
He went into the kitchen.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.360
Osman waited behind,
then followed him in.

37:15.880 --> 37:18.400
The Imam was obviously comfortable
enough to stay seated

37:18.440 --> 37:19.840
when they started speaking.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.120
He was strangled after a struggle.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.400
Centimetre diagonal scar. It's him.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.440
If he was topped for what he knows,
the Imam's murder was a team job.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.320
So, now the killer's
- forced to improvise.
- Mm-hmm.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.520
Burn the evidence, make it look
like it was a fridge fire.

37:37.560 --> 37:40.040
Shear the wires first.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.320
Now we need an accelerant.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.840
All that's around...

37:45.880 --> 37:48.120
hand sanitiser.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.400
Ethyl alcohol. Glycerine.

37:50.440 --> 37:55.040
Pour it on the floor, drag the
body on top to make sure it burns.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.680
Right, but I need to be out
of the building to have an alibi.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.080
So, I need a wick.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.800
Elastane and acrylic.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.480
A sock.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.160
His auction's about to close
for a pair of shoes.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.120
Hundred and sixty quid.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.720
For these?

38:16.760 --> 38:18.000
And these.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.280
When was the last time
you saw a pair of these?

38:23.320 --> 38:26.680
Today. Haroon. He nicks shoes.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.040
He nicked Haroon's shoes!

38:29.080 --> 38:30.840
He goes to get a sock

38:30.880 --> 38:35.120
to use as a wick... Mm-hm.
..to buy him time to get away.

38:35.160 --> 38:39.080
But, he doesn't wear the shoes.
Why not?

38:39.120 --> 38:43.000
Didn't want to offend
Allah under any circumstances?

38:47.440 --> 38:49.720
Betsy. Have you bagged him?

38:49.760 --> 38:51.000
Not in that sense.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.080
Hiya, Betsy.
You'd better get him here.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.800
Well, the state of him—
I'll be driving. What's the MO?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.120
Strangulation.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.360
Wow.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.120
Alright.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.800
Sorry, Wolfe!

39:15.720 --> 39:18.240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

39:24.800 --> 39:27.320
Go, go, go, go, go! That's right.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.720
That's er- dun't matter!

39:52.400 --> 39:54.280
- Bets.
- Dot.

39:54.320 --> 39:58.040
Yeah, no, I’m at the airport.
And, er, he’s in the airport.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.320
- What?
- Yeah, just— can you
hold on the line? Cheers.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.520
Wolfe!

40:13.960 --> 40:16.000
-- Sorry... Oh!Excuse me.
- Oh!
- Sorry.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.360
Alright, alright.
Thank you. Alright.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.320
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.880
Passport please.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.640
I don't need a passport
because I'm going to... Newcastle!

40:24.680 --> 40:27.240
Betsy says you've got to wait here!
That's an order!

40:27.280 --> 40:28.640
Forensics.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.520
Yeah, he's bought a fucking ticket.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.320
He's airside!

40:36.360 --> 40:38.400
And Security won't let me through.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.480
I'll get backup. We're on the way.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.720
Haroon Waseem, you are under arrest.

40:48.760 --> 40:49.800
Excuse me?

40:49.840 --> 40:51.240
I'm afraid not, Haroon.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.840
He's not to be excused.

40:52.880 --> 40:57.000
Can we get some help here? This
guy's scaring me pregnant fiancé!

40:57.040 --> 40:59.720
I don't know what it is,
but it's not nothing.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.120
Haroon, what's going on?

41:01.160 --> 41:03.720
Osman Choudhary was dead
when we got there.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.760
You went there this morning to get
your shoes, didn't you, Haroon?

41:06.800 --> 41:09.560
You were going to use the line up
as your alibi, yes?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.920
What shoes?

41:10.960 --> 41:12.520
Scream for help!

41:12.560 --> 41:14.520
This's gone beyond a joke now.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.760
This's a guy with issues who's
been stalking us previously.

41:17.800 --> 41:21.360
The shoes that Osman Choudhary
nicked whilst Haroon

41:21.400 --> 41:23.040
murdered your brother!

41:23.080 --> 41:25.360
Hey, we're on our own here,
with this nutter.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.600
Wolfe!

41:26.640 --> 41:28.480
We just want to board our plane.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.960
If that was the last thing
you did this morning

41:31.000 --> 41:35.160
before coming to the line-up,
the shoes will be in your carry-on.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.880
Open the bag, Haroon!

41:37.920 --> 41:41.680
Show us the shoes that'll have
yours and Osman Choudhary's DNA.

41:43.040 --> 41:46.440
We are not missing
this flight because of him.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.520
- Open the bag, Haroon.
- Ha!

41:49.560 --> 41:53.640
Police! Everybody stay back.
Stay back.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.280
Alright, alright-
What the fuck?!

42:06.320 --> 42:08.600
You let her go, right now!

42:08.640 --> 42:12.440
We're gonna walk slowly to the exit.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.080
Give me a clear path!
Armed response, now!

42:15.120 --> 42:16.360
I'll let her go!

42:16.400 --> 42:18.520
We're eastbound on the travelator
at Terminal 1.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.640
I'll break her neck!

42:19.680 --> 42:21.040
You told him, didn't you?

42:22.480 --> 42:26.080
You couldn't resist telling Abdullah
I was pregnant before we left.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.400
I had a right to tell him how proud
I was of my expanding family, so?

42:29.440 --> 42:31.040
To rub his nose in it?

42:31.080 --> 42:33.280
Abdullah went for me!

42:33.320 --> 42:37.680
What was he supposed to do?
I'm the Imam's sister!

42:37.720 --> 42:39.720
For two more weeks,
he didn't need to know!

42:39.760 --> 42:41.240
You knew what he'd do!

42:41.280 --> 42:43.560
He went for me.
Of course he did!

42:43.600 --> 42:44.960
Wolfe, shut the fu-

42:45.000 --> 42:49.120
He probably was banking on it!
Weren't you, Hazza? Huh?

42:49.160 --> 42:51.920
Zara, the only reason he went
there was to shut down the only

42:51.960 --> 42:53.480
other man you've ever listened to.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.000
If he knew you, he'd know
you only listen to yourself.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.280
Wolfe!

43:01.720 --> 43:03.720
Armed Police, step back!

43:03.760 --> 43:06.480
Great move, missus. You ok?

43:06.520 --> 43:07.560
Yeah.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.320
Are you OK, darling?
Do you need medical attention?

43:16.360 --> 43:18.160
No, don't waste it on me.
Where's he off to?

43:18.200 --> 43:20.400
There's not a mark on me,
by the way.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.080
I thought you were pizza.

43:44.120 --> 43:46.800
I've been called worse.
Oh, wait, say that again.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.360
I have a joke about inches.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.400
What do you want, Wolfe?

43:50.440 --> 43:52.600
Chance to put things right.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.000
You're going to help
prove my mum innocent?

43:55.040 --> 43:56.400
That kind of right?

43:56.440 --> 43:58.080
No-one can promise you that,
Dominique.

43:58.120 --> 44:01.360
What we will do though,
is look at all of the facts.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.240
- You serious?
- Yours or mine?

44:04.280 --> 44:07.680
We'll do it together.
As a team. Peer supervision.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.040
I'll see you at your
stations first thing.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.240
We have a lot of prep.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.960
Wolfe!

44:17.000 --> 44:19.960
"If we make ricin and botch it,
everyone in this building

44:20.000 --> 44:21.840
could be dead in thirty six hours."

44:21.880 --> 44:24.240
"Nearer seventy two."

44:26.800 --> 44:29.960
Inevitably appreciated.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.760
If I were you, I'd have
awaited the outcome, though.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.080
Nevertheless.

44:58.040 --> 45:03.560
♪ I can see clearly now,
the rain has gone

45:05.840 --> 45:11.000
♪ I can see all obstacles

45:13.480 --> 45:18.560
