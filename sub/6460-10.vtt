19:33.873 --> 19:35.673
is to join a cult.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.409
(Max)
Well, you made friends with me,
and I'm not in a cult...

19:38.411 --> 19:40.044
anymore.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.714
(Caroline)
Max, are you and I gonna be like
you and Becky someday?

19:43.716 --> 19:46.017
(Max)
Not unless one of us gets
really, really,

19:46.019 --> 19:48.553
I mean, so much cooler.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.321
(Caroline)
I'm serious.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.124
Am I gonna be just some waitress
you used to know?

19:53.126 --> 19:54.525
'Cause that would kill me.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.826
[Max sighs]

19:55.828 --> 19:57.562
(Max)
I don't think of you
that way at all.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.630
- Aww.
- I mean as a waitress.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.632
(Max)
Look, yes,
Becky and I worked together,

20:01.634 --> 20:03.568
and yes, we had kind of
a business dream, too,

20:03.570 --> 20:06.170
but you and I have so much more
than that.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.639
You and I are about to die
in the woods.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.107
Look.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.475
(Caroline)
We are getting in that car

20:11.477 --> 20:15.112
even if this guy
has a hook for a hand.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.414
(Oleg)
Wazzup?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.216
(Sophie)
Hey, girls.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.251
(Caroline)
I never thought
I'd be happy to see Oleg

20:20.253 --> 20:21.953
on a dark road at night.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.555
Sophie, what are you guys
doing here?

20:24.557 --> 20:27.491
Oh, well, Max texted me
her location.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.627
Said if I didn't
hear back from her,

20:29.629 --> 20:33.397
you'd been abducted by the cult
and to come rescue you.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.199
I was in a cult once.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.201
It's called Avon.

20:40.472 --> 20:43.975
So you were so certain
I couldn't make a normal friend

20:43.977 --> 20:45.676
you had an escape plan?

20:45.678 --> 20:48.179
Hey, sometimes
my negativity pays off.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.681
Sometimes it gets me
in mall jail.
