<i>I hate whoever this is.</i>

02:53.941 --> 02:55.541
Well, that's not very polite.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.743
<i>- I almost
recognize your voice.</i>

02:57.745 --> 02:59.278
<i>What's your name again?</i>

02:59.280 --> 03:00.779
Mrs. put this in your mouth?

03:04.685 --> 03:05.817
Yes, it's, um...

Yt's on Saturday

03:07.388 --> 03:08.887
<i>at fuck off field.
- Ha.</i>

03:08.889 --> 03:11.490
- Um, they're playing against
the judgmental dykes.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.426
<i>- Will hubby, whatever you want
to call him, be there?</i>

03:14.428 --> 03:16.962
Mm, no, Michael's out of town.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.498
<i>- Ha!
Of course.</i>

03:19.500 --> 03:21.400
<i>That's why you fucking call.</i>

03:21.402 --> 03:22.935
<i>You don't call
for four months, puta,</i>

03:22.937 --> 03:24.636
<i>and now you need a warm body
to fill the void.</i>

03:24.638 --> 03:26.605
<i>- Pen, pen...
- fucking asshole.</i>

03:26.607 --> 03:28.273
- I know, but it's, like,
it's not like that.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.275
I promise, okay?

03:30.277 --> 03:32.244
<i>- Yeah, right.
Typical.</i>

03:32.246 --> 03:34.246
I was also, um,

03:34.248 --> 03:35.547
wondering if you had any pot?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.423
Sellout!

04:24.999 --> 04:26.698
One week.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.735
One week
he doesn't call me.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.470
What the fuck is that?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.772
It's like, how long does it take
to fucking get settled?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.475
He's, like, at his fucking mom's
house, you know what I mean?

04:36.477 --> 04:37.743
- Maybe the bitch
won't let him call.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.478
You said she
fucking hates you, right?

04:39.480 --> 04:40.612
Yeah, for sure.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.813
I'm sure she's anxious to see

04:41.815 --> 04:43.415
you and fucking Harvard
get married.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.920
Ready?
We'll race.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.924
- Fuck that.
- Hold up.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.360
Here, I'll use your bungees.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.329
What?

04:57.331 --> 04:59.531
- Wait, hang on.
- Okay.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.300
Pull me up.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.402
Pull me up.
You're not strong enough.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.003
Pull me up!
- Pull me up.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.005
Pull me up.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.474
Come on.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.727
- Ow!
Shit.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.867
Where the fuck have you been?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.969
<i>- Good morning.
My name's detective Brooks.</i>

06:10.971 --> 06:13.004
<i>I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning.</i>

06:13.006 --> 06:14.106
Who?

06:14.108 --> 06:15.574
<i>Uh, detective Jonathan Brooks</i>

06:15.576 --> 06:17.442
<i>from San Bernardino county.</i>

06:17.444 --> 06:19.978
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

06:19.980 --> 06:21.079
Uh, Josie.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.849
Uh, Josephine Tyrell.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.550
What happened?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.152
<i>- Miss Tyrell,
your phone number was found</i>

06:27.154 --> 06:28.887
<i>on a motel registration.</i>

06:28.889 --> 06:30.822
<i>We're just trying to
gather some information.</i>

06:30.824 --> 06:32.758
<i>Has there been
any individual that you know</i>

06:32.760 --> 06:34.993
<i>that's been missing recently?</i>

06:34.995 --> 06:38.029
I don't... mm...

06:38.031 --> 06:42.801
I don't... i don't... what...
What do you mean "missing"?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.704
<i>Well, we've got a white male</i>

06:45.706 --> 06:49.508
<i>registered as, uh, Oscar wilde.</i>

06:49.510 --> 06:51.710
<i>Miss Tyrell,</i>

06:51.712 --> 06:55.080
<i>uh, do you have any idea
who this person might be?</i>

06:58.951 --> 07:02.921
Uh,

07:02.923 --> 07:04.089
maybe, um.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.994
I don't think so.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.163
<i>- The individual
we're trying to identify</i>

07:11.165 --> 07:13.198
<i>is in his mid-20s,</i>

07:13.200 --> 07:14.933
<i>tattoo on his right wrist,</i>

07:14.935 --> 07:17.936
<i>two moles on
the right side of his chest.</i>

07:17.938 --> 07:20.205
<i>Miss Tyrell,
do you know this person?</i>

07:25.112 --> 07:26.178
<i>Miss Tyrell?</i>

07:26.180 --> 07:27.579
<i>Do you know this person?</i>

07:31.518 --> 07:33.118
Yes.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.022
<i>- Miss Tyrell, I'm very sorry
to have to inform you.</i>

07:37.024 --> 07:39.925
<i>The body was found
in a motel in 29 palms</i>

07:39.927 --> 07:42.928
<i>from what looks like
an apparent suicide,</i>

07:42.930 --> 07:46.064
<i>self-inflicted gunshot
wound to the head.</i>

07:46.066 --> 07:47.999
<i>We're still getting
all the details.</i>

07:48.001 --> 07:50.735
<i>We're trying to locate
any family members.</i>

07:50.737 --> 07:54.105
<i>Do you know if he has
any living relatives?</i>

07:57.144 --> 07:59.611
A mother.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.813
<i>A mother.</i>

08:01.815 --> 08:05.150
<i>A mother.
A mother.</i>

08:06.487 --> 08:10.489
<i>A mother.
A mother.</i>

08:10.491 --> 08:12.591
<i>A mother.</i>

08:12.593 --> 08:13.792
<i>A mother.</i>

08:14.962 --> 08:16.061
<i>A mother.</i>

08:17.064 --> 08:18.129
<i>A mother.</i>

08:19.132 --> 08:20.265
<i>A mother. A mother.</i>

08:23.003 --> 08:27.272
<i>A mother.
A mother.</i>

08:27.274 --> 08:28.607
<i>A mother.</i>

08:29.810 --> 08:33.010
<i>A mother.
A mother.</i>

08:34.214 --> 08:37.015
<i>A mother.
A mother.</i>

08:38.150 --> 08:41.152
<i>A mother.
A mother.</i>

09:45.151 --> 09:46.785
Hey, excuse me.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.153
Look, just because
you saw me naked

09:48.155 --> 09:50.622
does not mean
I'm gonna fuck you, okay?

09:50.624 --> 09:53.158
- Uh, no, no,
i didn't think that.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.628
I wouldn't think...
Y, uh,

09:56.630 --> 09:58.096
I just thought maybe
you wanted to

09:58.098 --> 09:59.331
maybe go for a swim?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.302
Do you have a pool?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.805
Sort of.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.668
There is a pool, I promise.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.004
Yeah, I hope so.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.672
Whoa.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.211
That's a pool.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.946
That's a pool, yeah.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.781
You said you wanted
to go swimming, right?

10:49.783 --> 10:52.851
- Uh, it's kind of, like,
the middle of the afternoon.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.753
She could come back, like,
any second, right?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.054
Oh, no, no, trust me.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.722
She's away, touring.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.257
Besides,
she's terrified of water.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.292
I don't think I ever saw
her come in here once.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.927
Hmm.

11:04.730 --> 11:08.133
- So, what do you think,
you gonna

11:08.135 --> 11:09.234
give it a shot, jump in?

11:09.236 --> 11:10.935
Yeah, it's just...

11:10.937 --> 11:13.738
Such a shame, you know,
a waste, really, because...

11:13.740 --> 11:16.274
- Mm-hmm.
- I already have dysentery, so.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.709
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.044
Right, right.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.879
You afraid?

11:20.881 --> 11:23.081
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm super chicken.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.450
Yeah, you just, like,
struck fear in me, bro.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.356
Oh, my.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.357
Well?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.892
Uh,

11:33.894 --> 11:35.960
yeah, I can't swim.

11:35.962 --> 11:36.961
What?

11:36.963 --> 11:39.130
- No.
Yeah, see, I'm not...

11:39.132 --> 11:40.398
<i>I'm not sportif.</i>

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
<i>- Sportif?
- Yeah.</i>

11:41.902 --> 11:43.301
<i>- What the fuck
does "sportif" mean?</i>

11:57.917 --> 11:59.884
Hmm.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.786
Are you a tree?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.789
No.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.191
I promise, no, no, I'm not.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.325
- You are.
- Yes, I'm a tree.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.326
You are, huh?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.994
Mm-hmm.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.838
Who are you?

12:21.073 --> 12:24.442
Oscar wilde.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.277
And I'm wild for you.

12:38.057 --> 12:41.459
<i>It doesn't make
any fucking sense.</i>

12:41.461 --> 12:45.130
<i>- Whatever happened,
whatever this is,</i>

12:45.132 --> 12:46.965
<i>we're gonna get
through it, okay?</i>

12:46.967 --> 12:50.335
- Just go
make me a drink, okay?

12:53.339 --> 12:54.439
What kind of drink?

12:54.441 --> 12:56.141
Alcohol.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.921
Fuck.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.329
Hello?

13:58.938 --> 14:02.006
Who is this?

14:03.943 --> 14:06.077
<i>If my son had never met you,</i>

14:06.079 --> 14:08.213
<i>would he have killed himself?</i>

14:10.483 --> 14:12.417
<i>Hmm?</i>

14:15.888 --> 14:17.422
- You don't even
know me, Meredith...

14:17.424 --> 14:20.625
<i>- I could have you
taken care of, you know.</i>

14:20.627 --> 14:22.360
<i>One phone call,</i>

14:22.362 --> 14:24.195
<i>five grand,</i>

14:24.197 --> 14:26.264
<i>it would be very easy.</i>

14:26.266 --> 14:28.299
- I hope that makes
you feel better.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.169
<i>I don't want to feel better.</i>

14:31.171 --> 14:35.340
<i>I want you to suffer
the way I'm suffering now!</i>

14:37.644 --> 14:41.412
Then you didn't have to call!

15:43.576 --> 15:45.977
How dare you?

15:45.979 --> 15:47.178
How dare you?

15:47.180 --> 15:49.047
- Meredith.
- How dare you!

15:49.049 --> 15:50.048
Meredith.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.582
How dare you?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.584
Go on!
Get away!

15:53.586 --> 15:54.953
How dare you?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.487
Stop, Meredith, stop.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.557
Meredith...

16:41.633 --> 16:44.502
- you know, she only saves
those sorts of greetings

16:44.504 --> 16:47.071
for the special few.

16:50.743 --> 16:54.012
Cal Faraday,

16:54.014 --> 16:55.546
Michael's father.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.559
<i>It's not your fault, you know.</i>

17:08.560 --> 17:12.063
Michael had issues you-you
can't even begin imagine.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.800
Your wife is

17:16.803 --> 17:18.368
fucking insane.

17:20.773 --> 17:21.772
My ex-wife.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.808
Mm.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.810
Not surprised she hates you.

17:25.811 --> 17:28.780
See, you don't know how things
used to be with her and Michael.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.248
It was just the two of them

17:30.250 --> 17:32.650
in their own little world.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.552
No intruders welcome.

17:34.554 --> 17:39.223
Back then,
i was the interloper.

17:39.225 --> 17:44.062
Yeah.
My own son.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.799
But recently,

17:47.801 --> 17:50.735
he started
calling again.

17:50.737 --> 17:55.173
Quite a lot, actually.

17:55.175 --> 18:00.344
Told me all about you
in those calls.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.245
Really?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.182
He loved you, Josie.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.484
Thought you were smart,

18:06.486 --> 18:09.787
original,

18:09.789 --> 18:11.456
very real.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.727
He said your... your dad
drives a tow truck?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.296
Yeah.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.131
Yes.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.766
- Is there a mother
in the picture?

18:27.841 --> 18:29.874
My dad was a... was a fisherman

18:29.876 --> 18:31.442
out of coos bay, Oregon.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.812
- Is this what
Michael thought of me?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.849
Some kind of novelty?

18:37.851 --> 18:40.518
"Real"?

18:40.520 --> 18:45.623
That's another word
for "poor," right?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.291
No.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.727
"Real" means real.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.130
He loved you.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.499
Yeah.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.766
Right.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.310
I got you.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.683
He left this for you.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.954
Hello?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.655
Get dressed.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.557
- How the fuck
did you get my keys?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.560
- I took them when you were
passed out in your own piss.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.830
Get up and get it together.
People are coming over.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.831
What?

20:33.833 --> 20:34.899
What people?

20:34.901 --> 20:35.967
Your friends.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.835
Remember them?

20:37.837 --> 20:41.405
They're the people who help you
get through shit like this.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.011
- And I was always
afraid of death

20:47.013 --> 20:49.981
until, um,
my grandfather passed.

20:49.983 --> 20:54.485
He was a big country music fan,
and he, you know, was...

20:54.487 --> 20:56.754
We always used to
sing songs together.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.990
When he actually died,
we all stood around the bed

20:58.992 --> 21:02.293
holding hands, singing to him.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.829
There was this
thing when he actually passed...

25:22.888 --> 25:24.688
Hi.

25:40.005 --> 25:43.274
So many friends.

25:43.276 --> 25:46.644
Such good friends.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.013
"We're sorry.
We're...

25:49.015 --> 25:50.881
"oh... oh, we're so sorry.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.917
We're so sorry for your loss."

25:54.787 --> 25:56.754
And then they go out and

25:56.756 --> 25:58.188
have their
teeth cleaned...

26:00.326 --> 26:02.092
And eat dinner.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.680
Do you live here alone?

26:22.682 --> 26:26.617
- No, I have ghosts
that keep me company.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.954
- You know, i... i could
hear you playing

26:29.956 --> 26:32.056
from all the way
down the street.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.791
It's brahms.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.794
Whenever Michael had a headache,

26:36.796 --> 26:39.363
he always had
to have his brahms.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.734
He played me brahms.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.136
And I played it for him,

26:46.138 --> 26:47.304
of course.

26:56.881 --> 26:59.683
- You were following me,
weren't you?

26:59.685 --> 27:00.718
Well, i...

27:00.720 --> 27:03.787
I was worried about Michael.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.390
I hadn't heard from him
in a little while,

27:06.392 --> 27:09.727
but I never thought that...

27:15.734 --> 27:19.770
World's greatest pianist.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.739
Help yourself.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.988
I heard that you
had drinks with the father.

27:37.990 --> 27:42.860
I'll assume he said
many horrible things about me.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.895
There w... the base...

27:44.897 --> 27:47.765
The... the baseball,
did he tell you?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.066
No?

27:49.068 --> 27:53.003
We were in New York
for a... a recital.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.072
And Cal and I were
long since divorced,

27:55.074 --> 27:57.808
but he had
one of those townhouses

27:57.810 --> 28:00.911
down on bank street.

28:00.913 --> 28:04.314
Between marriages,
as I recall,

28:04.316 --> 28:06.316
briefly, of course.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.818
Anyway,

28:07.820 --> 28:11.055
he always kept this baseball
on his desk.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.323
It was signed by
all those famous players,

28:13.325 --> 28:15.459
you know, babe Ruth and so on.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.262
He fondled it while he wrote.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.798
Talk about freudian.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.301
Anyway, we were up there
discussing Michael's future.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.337
And he got it into his head

28:27.339 --> 28:31.008
to throw the ball at Michael.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.177
"Come on!
Think fast!"

28:33.179 --> 28:37.748
you know... like a common
schoolyard bully.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.450
That's... that's

28:39.452 --> 28:40.951
the Jewish Hemingway for you.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.986
But you know what Michael did?

28:47.026 --> 28:50.194
He picked up the ball,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.463
and he threw it

28:52.465 --> 28:56.934
out of the window.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.403
I mean, talk about babe Ruth.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.305
You know, it was rolling down

29:01.307 --> 29:04.808
the gutter on bank street.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.747
It was fantastic.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.931
I guess this is what they call
a ten-second rule.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.948
Josie?

29:44.950 --> 29:47.785
<i>Por favor?</i>

29:47.787 --> 29:49.853
You can relax.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.389
You've already made it
into the lion's stomach.

29:52.391 --> 29:56.059
You don't have to worry
about its bite.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.867
What do you want to drink?

30:03.869 --> 30:05.936
Alcohol.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.985
Thank you.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.987
Would you... would you...

30:23.989 --> 30:27.257
Put another log on the fire?

30:39.871 --> 30:41.471
Could you do another one?

30:41.473 --> 30:43.273
I'm freezing.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.282
Gently, gently.

30:52.284 --> 30:56.019
And then just
open a little gap,

30:56.021 --> 30:59.289
about... about an inch
so it'll draw.

31:30.355 --> 31:32.890
Josie, you can't drive
in your condition.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.026
- I can't live
in my condition.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.942
Ow.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.423
Hey.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.507
<i>"I am not sportif."</i>

34:31.235 --> 34:33.737
What are you doing?

34:33.739 --> 34:35.672
You have no right to go
through his things,

34:35.674 --> 34:37.340
not without my permission.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.341
I'm sorry.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.610
You can see your own way out.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.216
Here you go.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.596
Sorry I'm late.

34:59.598 --> 35:04.734
- It's okay.
- Had to stop at the bank.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.704
So.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.239
Listen.

35:11.209 --> 35:12.709
It's a thriller.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.344
It's very psychological.

35:14.346 --> 35:17.414
Sort of antonioni
meets buñuel.

35:17.416 --> 35:22.185
A story of lovers
caught in purgatory.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.387
It's called "in pergatoria."

35:24.389 --> 35:26.857
- Listen...
- You must be in it.

35:26.859 --> 35:28.792
I wrote it for you.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.595
Jeremy, okay,

35:31.597 --> 35:33.630
just need one minute

35:33.632 --> 35:36.366
of silence to eat,

35:36.368 --> 35:37.667
okay?

35:37.669 --> 35:40.270
Friday, 5:00 A.M.

35:40.272 --> 35:43.540
Nod yes, and I leave.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.612
Nod yes...

35:51.682 --> 35:53.150
And I leave.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.775
- Hi.
- Jesus.

36:18.777 --> 36:19.943
What are you doing here?

36:19.945 --> 36:21.278
- I heard you needed
a model, right?

36:21.280 --> 36:22.212
- Yeah, but...
- Yeah.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.880
Not you, Josie.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.682
- Why?
- 'Cause...

36:25.684 --> 36:27.951
I'd heard about...

36:27.953 --> 36:29.386
And I'm so sorry.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.787
- It's... yeah...
- I'm s...

36:30.789 --> 36:32.889
- Fine.
- I'm so... you shouldn't be here.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.524
- I mean...
- - What?

36:34.526 --> 36:36.526
- Josie, the way you're in...
And you should be home.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.461
- No.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.530
Please, I don't want to go home.
- Seriously, you gotta be...

36:40.532 --> 36:41.731
Take care.
- I don't want to... li...

36:41.733 --> 36:42.832
That's the last place

36:42.834 --> 36:45.302
I should be right now, okay?

36:45.304 --> 36:46.970
So please, Phil?

36:46.972 --> 36:49.439
- Please.
Okay?

36:49.441 --> 36:50.807
- O... okay.
- Please... yes?

36:50.809 --> 36:52.409
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.843
Oh, my gosh.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.233
It's actually not that boring.
- Hmm.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.002
Bach believed
the world made sense.

37:19.004 --> 37:23.273
He believed in god.

37:23.275 --> 37:25.842
Now...
Listen to brahms.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.544
Let me play you some of him.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.054
How did you find me here?

38:11.056 --> 38:13.290
I just wanted to apologize

38:13.292 --> 38:15.058
for the way
i spoke to you this morning.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.793
It wasn't right.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.597
It's just... it's...
Everything's just...

38:20.599 --> 38:22.999
You know.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.067
But I could buy you lunch.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.068
Not hungry.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.537
Drink?

38:27.539 --> 38:30.073
I know you're
as hungover as I am.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.909
Hair of the dog, for Michael?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.816
Thank you.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.588
Thanks.

38:53.732 --> 38:58.968
Did you ever take Michael
to lunches like these?

38:58.970 --> 39:00.070
Uh,

39:00.072 --> 39:03.473
when he was a little boy, yes.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.908
But later on
he couldn't bear it,

39:04.910 --> 39:06.543
too many fat cats.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.379
I bet he never once took you
to a decent restaurant.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.014
Mm.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.016
No.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.751
We mainly just ate at home.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.419
You poor thing.

39:16.421 --> 39:17.954
Michael couldn't boil water.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.664
Michael was a great cook,

39:27.666 --> 39:29.866
actually.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.970
He had all these cookbooks.

39:33.972 --> 39:38.575
We even had this little garden
with, like, herbs and stuff.

39:38.577 --> 39:42.112
Once he cooked a whole fish

39:42.114 --> 39:44.748
from the Chinese market,

39:44.750 --> 39:48.151
with the head and the tail
still on.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.686
Mm.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.955
We even ate the eyeballs.

39:51.957 --> 39:55.158
And the cheeks.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.661
That's the delicacy.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.132
Do you think it's awful that I

40:02.134 --> 40:04.534
didn't know my own son
any better?

40:07.138 --> 40:08.838
I...

40:08.840 --> 40:10.106
I don't think

40:10.108 --> 40:14.744
anybody knows everything
about somebody.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.813
Excuse me.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.615
You're Meredith loewy,
aren't you?

40:18.617 --> 40:19.849
Yes.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.718
- I saw you
in San Francisco last year.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.454
You were amazing.
- Oh, thank you.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.889
Thank you so much.
That's very kind.

40:25.891 --> 40:28.591
- Are you planning on
being on tour anytime soon?

40:28.593 --> 40:30.593
Uh, yes, very soon, in fact.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.997
I look forward to it.

40:33.999 --> 40:37.534
I was very sorry
to hear about your son.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.204
Thank you.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.548
Must be nice,

40:51.550 --> 40:53.116
people respecting you like that.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.485
- Yes, it would appear
that way to you, wouldn't it?

41:01.058 --> 41:02.859
So do you date?

41:02.861 --> 41:05.228
Date?

41:05.230 --> 41:08.064
Dating, to date somebody?

41:08.066 --> 41:09.966
I mean, that guy was pretty hot.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.937
- That's a little juvenile,
don't you think?

41:13.939 --> 41:16.139
So I guess not?

41:16.141 --> 41:18.475
Well, I'm... I'm not celibate.

41:18.477 --> 41:19.909
Michael thought you were.

41:19.911 --> 41:22.078
- I didn't wave my relationships
under his nose.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.150
I once had an affair
with a Czech violinist.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.953
He was impossible.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.855
Should I have forced
my sex life on him?

41:31.857 --> 41:33.256
Would that have
been less oedipal?

41:33.258 --> 41:35.091
More?

41:35.093 --> 41:37.594
I don't know.

41:37.596 --> 41:40.663
I was all he had.

41:46.971 --> 41:49.839
Josie, I'd like to
ask you a favor.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.810
I'd like to see
where Michael lived.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.246
He's gone.
I just want to see.

41:56.248 --> 42:00.683
Yeah, that...

42:00.685 --> 42:02.218
That's why you're
being so nice to me...

42:02.220 --> 42:03.753
- Josie...
- Right?

42:03.755 --> 42:05.822
- People say things
when they're upset.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.257
Do.

42:07.259 --> 42:08.591
I think you meant to say,

42:08.593 --> 42:11.995
people do things
when they're upset.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.768
Well.

42:21.005 --> 42:24.274
You remind me of Michael.

42:24.276 --> 42:26.009
Very pigheaded.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.746
Oh, come on.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.548
I'm just asking to see it,
for Christ sake.

42:31.550 --> 42:34.150
I'm not asking to move in.

42:34.152 --> 42:35.718
Hmm?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.935
You could, uh,

42:51.937 --> 42:54.938
take your coat off
if you want.

43:12.957 --> 43:16.225
- He was always so gifted
with portraiture.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.597
Hmm.

43:41.685 --> 43:44.354
We loved this.

43:44.356 --> 43:45.822
May I have this?

43:45.824 --> 43:48.057
This isn't a shopping trip.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.873
Hey, hey.

44:03.875 --> 44:06.009
Those are
his private journals.

44:06.011 --> 44:07.210
- They're just
artifacts now, Josie...

44:07.212 --> 44:09.178
please.

44:10.414 --> 44:12.782
It's your house.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.076
"Señor music"?

44:40.078 --> 44:43.012
- Um, yeah, Michael
used to play piano

44:43.014 --> 44:44.814
for, like, kids' dance classes,

44:44.816 --> 44:47.784
so they called him
señor music.

44:47.786 --> 44:49.318
Michael?

44:51.222 --> 44:53.423
Michael abhorred children.

44:53.425 --> 44:57.160
He didn't hate children.

44:57.162 --> 44:59.762
We even talked
about having a baby.

44:59.764 --> 45:02.699
- Well, thank god
for small mercies.

45:14.178 --> 45:16.779
Cut.

45:16.781 --> 45:18.981
Kay, I need my viewfinder.

46:01.291 --> 46:03.860
- It's lighter,
it's lighter Freud.

46:03.862 --> 46:06.429
Emotionally, it's

46:06.431 --> 46:08.431
relatively a joke.

46:20.979 --> 46:23.412
This, this one here.
Mm-hmm.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.332
Hello?

47:49.334 --> 47:51.234
<i>It's Josie.</i>

47:51.236 --> 47:53.469
Josie?

47:53.471 --> 47:55.004
Josie, it's... it's late.

47:55.006 --> 47:57.506
- You said to call
if I ever needed you,

47:57.508 --> 48:01.377
and I fucking need you, Cal.

48:01.379 --> 48:03.546
Meredith.

48:03.548 --> 48:04.614
Meredith,

48:04.616 --> 48:07.016
<i>she took everything.</i>

49:19.489 --> 49:21.991
<i>- I don't have anyone
to call.</i>

49:23.428 --> 49:24.293
<i>No one.</i>

49:28.532 --> 49:30.967
Please, Cal, please,

49:30.969 --> 49:33.369
<i>would you call her for me?</i>

49:33.371 --> 49:36.005
<i>Okay, please?</i>

49:36.007 --> 49:39.342
- Look, th-there's
nothing I can do.

49:39.344 --> 49:42.311
<i>And even if I called her,
she wouldn't listen to me.</i>

49:42.313 --> 49:45.514
<i>Josie, look,
it's the middle of the night.</i>

49:45.516 --> 49:49.051
<i>Let's talk in the morning,
and I'll try to help, okay?</i>

49:49.053 --> 49:51.087
Yeah.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.989
Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.

49:52.991 --> 49:55.124
Yeah, you get some sleep, okay?

49:55.126 --> 49:58.127
You get some good
fucking sleep, okay?

52:05.857 --> 52:08.124
Yes?

52:08.126 --> 52:10.359
Ms. loewy is sleeping.

52:10.361 --> 52:13.863
Oh, no, no.
All concerts are canceled.

52:13.865 --> 52:16.465
Mm-hmm.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.666
Thank you.

55:13.677 --> 55:19.381
I fucked him in this bed,
Meredith.

55:19.383 --> 55:21.817
Your bed.

55:50.448 --> 55:52.514
Bitch.

56:54.677 --> 56:56.812
- We have a dress
for you already.

56:56.814 --> 56:58.180
No.

56:58.182 --> 57:01.116
This is the dress.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.152
- But, uh...
- Jeremy.

57:03.154 --> 57:04.686
I haven't slept
in two days.

57:04.688 --> 57:07.589
- Okay.
- Please, respect my process.

57:09.959 --> 57:11.927
Hey, what's up?

59:55.292 --> 59:58.026
You're gonna have to do better
than that, Meredith!

59:58.028 --> 01:00:01.229
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me!

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:52.347
Guy's following me and
now he's at my fucking house.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.116
<i>Josie, don't be crazy.</i>

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:56.118
<i>You know she's not
gonna take a hit out on you.</i>

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.819
<i>Jo-Josie,
I'm coming to you.</i>

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.287
<i>Where are you?
Tell me right now.</i>

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.056
- No, I'm sorry, I got to go.
I got to go.

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:02.124
<i>Look, Josie...</i>

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.241
oh.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:23.679
<i>Loewy residence.</i>

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:25.947
<i>It's Josie Tyrell.</i>

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:29.418
Thank you, Margaret.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.019
What do you want, Josie?

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.821
<i>What happened, Meredith?</i>

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:34.856
<i>Did your foot slip off
the gas pedal?</i>

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.259
Couldn't follow through, huh?

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.863
And now the guy with the flattop

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.298
<i>in the fucking car?</i>

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.400
- Your imagination
is running away with you, child.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.768
<i>Listen, Meredith,</i>

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:48.870
I told people

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.339
about this, okay?

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:54.876
So if I disappear,

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:55.877
they'll know.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.212
Good-bye, Josie.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.281
<i>- No, wait!
Wait-wait-wait, wait.</i>

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:08.023
Shh.
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:11.093
Josie.

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:13.428
Josie, listen, let's ju...
Let's just

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.298
call a truce, okay?

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.900
We're even.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:20.902
How much more can
we possibly hurt each other?

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.438
I can't take any more.
Can you?

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.173
<i>Huh?</i>

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:29.444
<i>Josie, I shouldn't have
taken your things.</i>

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.981
<i>I took it too far.</i>

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:37.886
I just want his...

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:39.821
I just want
his journals back.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.857
Please?

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:44.025
Just tell me where you are,

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.193
and I'll come to you.

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:47.129
<i>I'll bring you the journals.</i>

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:50.398
<i>Tell me where you are,
and I'll bring them to you.</i>

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:59.401
Where are the rest of them?

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:02.103
Stolis all around, ladies?

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:08.076
What do you want from me?

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.291
Did Michael ever tell you

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:26.294
what happened to me
when I was your age?

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.597
I had been working
with Rudolf serkin

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:31.199
at Curtis,
just before he died.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.334
Who?

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.603
- Um, he-he was
a very great pianist,

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:37.339
one of the greatest
of his time.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:40.108
And he was performing
at carnegie hall

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.644
with the Philadelphia orchestra,

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:45.113
brahms' second.

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:47.949
But he got sick,
i don't remember with what.

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:51.119
And he recommended me

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.554
to ormandy to replace him.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.524
I was 21.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.493
One day's notice.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.362
The brahms' second.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:02.931
I... it's a...
Yt's a monster concerto.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.933
It's a huge responsibility.

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:06.368
One day's notice.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.136
It was like one of
those old movies, you know,

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:10.238
where the star breaks her ankle

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.007
and the girl
gets her big chance.

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:16.211
I was so nervous.
Oh.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:19.147
I threw up before the concert.

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:22.484
But when I went out there...

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:27.956
Something else

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:30.125
took over.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.526
It was... it was like

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:35.964
being lifted up on wings.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:39.167
Harold schonberg
called me a goddess.

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:41.069
Hurok signed me
the following morning.

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:43.038
Within a week,
he'd organized a tour.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.041
It was like being in
the nose cone of a rocket,

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:49.311
the... the momentum, you know,
how fast it all came.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:50.445
It was...

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:56.685
Incredible.

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:58.954
Everything I'd worked for

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:02.724
since I was four years old.

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:25.046
My father drowned himself
in our pool a week later.

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:32.053
Couldn't even wait
till I got home.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.389
He always had to be the star.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:42.364
I didn't go
to the funeral.

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:45.367
I... i just... i toured.
I stayed in hotels.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:48.370
I was playing with all
of the great orchestras,

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:53.608
and I couldn't stand to be
by myself in a room.

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.610
And then I met Calvin,

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:59.114
thought I could put all of that
loneliness behind me.

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:02.617
Yeah, good luck with that.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:09.124
Josie...

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:14.629
I know you loved him,

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:17.532
like I did,

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.101
and I know you've lost,

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:22.137
like I have.

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:28.510
Would you consider

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:31.679
coming to stay with me
for a little while?

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:37.685
I'm so tired
of being alone.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:39.554
I...

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:42.190
I can't do it anymore.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:44.292
I ju... i... i can't.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:47.095
I just... i can't, i...

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.434
I'll give you
the rest of them.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:54.169
Please?

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.673
I'll give you
everything I have.

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:36.845
Wait, there!

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:39.714
Oh, my god...

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:41.683
Oh, fuck, it's still breathing.

01:08:43.854 --> 01:08:45.653
Michael!

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:48.189
What's wrong with you?
Michael, what do we do?

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:50.591
Michael!

01:08:56.867 --> 01:09:00.734
Why do I have to
do fucking everything?

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.725
It's all my fault.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.859
All my fault.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:28.328
I was so mean to him.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.454
May I help you?

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:40.928
Are you fucking shitting me?

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:42.797
I'm over here all worried
about you and shit,

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:46.034
and I find you here like this,
a little fucking Princess?

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:48.503
I'm very sick, pen.

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.071
Meredith is
taking care of me now.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.073
Are you hearing yourself?

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:53.775
Jesus.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:56.511
You saw her that night,
and suddenly you're sick?

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:58.379
Don't you think
that's a little suspicious?

01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:01.983
What if she's, like,
poisoning you or some shit?

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.752
I don't really care if she is.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.754
I'm so tired of my life.

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:08.056
Don't say that.

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:09.857
You're depressed, okay?

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:10.992
You're depressed,

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:13.861
but this fucking house?
Shit.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:15.463
It's a fucking creep factory.

01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:16.597
Guess what?

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:19.500
I like being in this house.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.569
It makes me feel closer to him.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:22.904
It smells like him.

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:24.739
He's dead, Josephine.

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:25.740
He's dead.

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:51.866
<i>- Hey, it's pen.
You know what to do...</i>

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:00.267
<i>go to your broken heart.</i>

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:03.037
<i>If you think
you don't have one, get one.</i>

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:05.072
<i>To get one, be Sincere.</i>

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.041
<i>Learn sincerity of intent...
- Learn sincerity of...</i>

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.442
<i>- By letting life enter...
- By letting life enter...</i>

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:10.177
<i>What is this?
- Shh.</i>

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.046
<i>Because you're helpless,
really, to do otherwise.</i>

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:14.081
<i>Poem by Jack hirschman.
- This is the guy that...</i>

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.183
<i>- after the beep, leave a
message for Josie or Michael.</i>

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:18.185
<i>Michael, that is terrible!</i>

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:24.925
<i>- It's interesting, isn't it,
that he said,</i>

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.328
"Josie or Michael."

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:31.065
<i>Didn't say,
"Josie and Michael."</i>

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:35.169
<i>Josie, think of how
you will feel one day</i>

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:38.506
<i>when you have a...
A screaming child on your hip</i>

01:19:38.508 --> 01:19:40.941
<i>and you look at out
the laundry in your yard</i>

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.843
<i>and you think,</i>

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:47.181
<i>"i could have had
a different life."</i>

01:19:47.183 --> 01:19:50.518
<i>I'm offering you that life,
Josie.</i>

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.387
<i>All I want in return</i>

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:56.323
<i>is you.</i>

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.927
Hello?

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:14.602
May I help you?

01:21:14.604 --> 01:21:16.570
Yes, I would like a room.

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:18.873
How many nights?

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.075
I'm not sure yet.

01:21:21.077 --> 01:21:23.210
Long day driving?

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.478
Yeah.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.948
- Mm, these roads
are hazardous at night.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:32.219
Those white lines
become hypnotizers.

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:39.660
About eight weeks ago, um,

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.930
a boy checked in here.

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:46.400
He registered
under the name Oscar wilde.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:53.007
I'd like to know
how many nights he stayed.

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:57.144
I know he stayed here.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.085
Room nine is nice.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.654

come outside for a second?

01:23:39.382 --> 01:23:44.318

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.259
Can I ask you

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:56.630

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:58.465
To me, he is Oscar.

01:23:58.467 --> 01:24:02.102
- Yeah, he liked
Oscar wilde a lot.

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:04.638

was Michael.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.441
