00:04.350 --> 00:06.413
Harry!
Thank God you called.

00:06.413 --> 00:08.663
Kate, where are you now?

00:08.663 --> 00:10.719
Oh, I'm on the way.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.749
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
How is she?

00:12.749 --> 00:13.672
I don't know.

00:13.672 --> 00:15.598
The veterinarian won't let me see her.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.898
Well, what did they say?

00:16.898 --> 00:19.220
She was hit by a car.
That's all they know.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.808
Oh! Oh, God.

00:22.504 --> 00:24.427
They think her back legs are broken.

00:24.427 --> 00:26.398
My poor baby.

00:26.702 --> 00:29.510
I don't know how it happened.
How did she get out of the yard?

00:29.510 --> 00:32.118
Maria must have left the gate open.

00:32.118 --> 00:34.267
I don't think so.
I checked it myself.

00:34.267 --> 00:35.469
Where are you now?

00:35.469 --> 00:38.955
Oh, I'm, uh...
I'm going past the ranger station.

00:39.274 --> 00:42.003
Oh, God, if something's happened to her,
I will never forgive myself.

00:42.003 --> 00:43.583
Just hurry!

00:44.085 --> 00:46.766
I'm... I'm going as fast as I can.

MONK Season 1 Epi. 02
Mr. Monk and the Psychic

02:09.000 --> 02:11.460
- Whoa. Press pass?
- No.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.691
- Are you on the list?
- No.

02:13.691 --> 02:15.426
Sorry, I can't let you in.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.083
Officer, this is Adrian Monk.

02:20.131 --> 02:22.614
Sorry, sir. I didn't know.

02:23.382 --> 02:26.568
Can we stand over there?
We don't like to be touched.

02:27.139 --> 02:30.122
Adrian. Adrian! Come on.

02:35.493 --> 02:36.852
As you can imagine,

02:36.852 --> 02:38.794
the past three days have been
very difficult,

02:38.794 --> 02:41.647
very painful for the entire department.

02:41.647 --> 02:44.841
Our prayers are
with the Ashcombe family.

02:44.841 --> 02:46.574
The former commissioner is here and

02:46.574 --> 02:49.789
has asked to say a few words.
Commissioner.

02:52.286 --> 02:56.211
It's been 72 hours since
my wife Katherine disappeared.

02:56.211 --> 02:59.883
I wanna thank everyone for
their prayers and good wishes.

02:59.883 --> 03:01.968
It's meant the world to me.

03:01.968 --> 03:05.378
There's someone out there
who knows what happened to my wife.

03:05.378 --> 03:07.804
I'm asking you to look into your heart

03:07.804 --> 03:11.518
and to come forward
with any information you might have.

03:12.372 --> 03:19.344
To Kate. If you can hear this,
hang in there, baby.

03:19.344 --> 03:21.014
I love you.

03:22.065 --> 03:23.858
Don't give up.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.867
Monk, what are you doing here?

03:31.867 --> 03:32.679
I wanna help.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.760
You wanna help?
Say a prayer for the man.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.124
I can do more than that, Captain.
You know I can.

03:37.124 --> 03:39.871
Can you imagine what
that man's going through?

03:39.871 --> 03:43.369
Yes, I can.

03:44.813 --> 03:47.238
Come on. Follow me.

03:49.948 --> 03:51.342
Commissioner.

03:51.682 --> 03:52.576
Harry.

03:52.951 --> 03:55.508
- Adrian Monk.
- Yes, of course.

03:55.508 --> 03:57.039
How are you, Detective?

03:57.039 --> 04:00.415
- Former detective.
- Not for long, I hope. We miss you.

04:00.415 --> 04:01.688
Thank you for coming.

04:01.688 --> 04:07.057
Sir, if there's anything that I can do,
I'm available 24-7.

04:08.272 --> 04:09.448
I appreciate that.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.984
I've become pretty familiar
with this type of crime.

04:11.984 --> 04:14.109
There is no crime yet, Monk.

04:14.109 --> 04:15.869
This is a Missing Persons case.

04:15.869 --> 04:17.164
Of course. I know.

04:17.164 --> 04:18.747
I know that.
And I'm sorry.

04:18.747 --> 04:19.963
Adrian.

04:20.688 --> 04:26.133
I just mean, if worse comes to worse,
and I pray it never does,

04:26.133 --> 04:28.344
I think I could be a real asset here.

04:28.344 --> 04:31.485
You won't be sorry, sir.
He is the best.

04:31.695 --> 04:35.772
Well, how can I not accept an offer
from Adrian Monk?

04:35.772 --> 04:38.676
Leland, see that he gets
a copy of the file and full access.

04:38.676 --> 04:41.597
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome aboard, Detective.

04:41.597 --> 04:44.234
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.304
Where am I?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.048
Where the hell...

05:45.492 --> 05:47.461
She was calling me.
She led me here.

05:47.461 --> 05:49.118
See, that's the way it happens sometimes.

05:49.118 --> 05:52.828
I was driving the car,
but her aura was guiding me.

05:52.828 --> 05:54.957
Write that down, Lieutenant.
It was her aura.

05:54.957 --> 05:56.973
And then I woke up,
and I was right here.

05:56.973 --> 05:59.127
See, she wanted me to find her.

05:59.127 --> 06:01.920
She didn't want to lie for the rest of
eternity under all that mud.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.940
- Can you blame her?
- And you never met Mrs. Ashcombe?

06:04.940 --> 06:07.218
No, never met her...
not until this morning.

06:07.218 --> 06:09.219
And do you know her husband at all?

06:09.219 --> 06:10.637
Never had the honor.

06:10.888 --> 06:13.102
Is there anything else you can tell us,
Miss Flint?

06:13.102 --> 06:15.143
Hell's bells, Captain.
You can call me Dolly.

06:15.143 --> 06:18.435
- You've known me for 20 years.
- Hello, Dolly.

06:18.659 --> 06:19.481
Did he tell you?

06:19.481 --> 06:21.981
He arrested me three times...
bunco and fraud.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.417
You always thought I was a quack,
didn't ya, huh, Captain?

06:24.417 --> 06:27.112
Never thought I'd actually
find somebody. Oh, hi!

06:27.112 --> 06:27.786
Excuse me?

06:27.786 --> 06:30.677
Can you get a picture of me
with the car? / Hey.

06:30.677 --> 06:32.523
- I'm just gonna...
- Hey, no, Dolly. Dolly.

06:32.523 --> 06:36.444
He is a police photographer.
He's not from the National Enquirer.

06:36.444 --> 06:39.986
- Right this way.
- Can't I just have one shot?

06:59.563 --> 07:01.282
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.

07:01.282 --> 07:07.164
What? / Looks like something was maybe
dragged along here. Something metal.

07:07.164 --> 07:08.970
That could be anything.

07:10.174 --> 07:12.727
But you see where the car ended up.

07:12.727 --> 07:16.582
If you imagine the trajectory,
it doesn't make sense.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.407
Don't complicate things, Monk.

07:19.407 --> 07:24.085
She was probably doing 70 or 75 miles
an hour when she missed the turn.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.856
Hey, did you hear who found the car?

07:26.856 --> 07:28.812
I heard. Dolly Flint.

07:28.812 --> 07:30.980
Crazy Dolly.
Can you believe that?

07:30.980 --> 07:33.039
No, I can't.

07:33.039 --> 07:34.708
Monk doesn't believe in psychics.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.660
I believe in what I can see.

07:36.660 --> 07:39.380
I believe in what's in front of me.

07:39.701 --> 07:42.883
You know how I found out that my ex
was still seeing his old girlfriend?

07:42.883 --> 07:44.707
Please, tell us.

07:44.949 --> 07:46.386
A psychic told me.

07:46.386 --> 07:49.553
And that's a true story, and
it was the best 35 bucks I ever spent.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.816
Thirty-five bucks?

07:50.816 --> 07:53.510
There have been cases...
documented cases...

07:53.510 --> 07:57.681
where psychics have found
missing kids, bodies.

07:57.681 --> 08:00.993
- It happens.
- Of course it happens!

08:00.993 --> 08:06.102
A thousand psychics making 10,000
predictions a year, two or three of them have to be right.

08:08.511 --> 08:09.856
Here he is.

08:16.277 --> 08:19.067
You know, I was the best man
at their wedding. / Really?

08:19.067 --> 08:20.830
This is gonna kill him.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.660
Kill him.
God.

08:29.366 --> 08:31.968
- That's strange.
- What?

08:31.968 --> 08:36.341
She went off the road here,
but look at the tree.

08:36.341 --> 08:41.304
The tree's intact.
No broken branches.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.846
Harry, I really don't think you should look.

08:46.173 --> 08:47.495
Why not?

08:48.459 --> 08:50.757
Because you should remember her
like she was.

08:50.757 --> 08:53.769
Leland, I have to see her.

08:53.769 --> 08:55.818
I have to say good-bye.

09:04.070 --> 09:05.578
Katherine!

09:12.257 --> 09:16.645
Hi. / Commissioner, this is Dolly Flint.
She found your wife's body.

09:16.886 --> 09:18.561
Yes, of course.

09:18.561 --> 09:21.563
It's amazing.
I can't thank you enough.

09:21.563 --> 09:25.237
I just wished I could have found her
before she crossed over.

09:38.969 --> 09:42.308
Adrian, don't you want a closer look?

09:42.509 --> 09:45.313
No, l-I can see from here.

09:45.869 --> 09:49.711
Would you like us to move the crash site
a little closer to you?

09:49.711 --> 09:51.562
No, I'm fine.

09:55.746 --> 09:57.137
Hi!

09:57.137 --> 09:58.953
- You found the body?
- Yeah.

09:58.953 --> 10:00.418
Are you a reporter?

10:00.418 --> 10:02.385
Miss Flint? Hello.

10:02.385 --> 10:04.648
My name is Sharona Fleming.

10:04.648 --> 10:07.896
And this is my friend...
oh, excuse me... my boss,

10:07.896 --> 10:09.546
Adrian Monk.

10:09.546 --> 10:13.404
He was consulting on the case
before you showed up to solve it.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.233
Why is he, uh, staring at me?

10:18.233 --> 10:20.955
I know. It's a little creepy
if you don't know him.

10:21.424 --> 10:22.642
Excuse me.

10:23.788 --> 10:25.745
Uh, Miss Flint.

10:25.745 --> 10:28.953
I just have to say that
it is an honor to meet you.

10:28.953 --> 10:32.763
I can't tell you how much money
I have wasted on those TV psychics.

10:32.763 --> 10:35.478
But you really have the power.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.814
I mean, a gift.

10:36.814 --> 10:38.480
Well, apparently.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.798
Can I call you sometime
for a private reading?

10:40.798 --> 10:43.305
Oh, yeah. But listen.

10:43.305 --> 10:46.451
The rates on my card no longer apply.

10:46.451 --> 10:49.536
They've gone up,
as of about two hours ago.

10:49.536 --> 10:51.660
Here's one for you, Mr. Monk.

10:52.315 --> 10:53.917
I'll take it to him.

10:53.917 --> 10:58.134
Maybe I could help you with, uh,
one of your cases sometime.

10:58.441 --> 11:01.247
- Ciao.
- Bye.

11:14.135 --> 11:18.677
Hold still. Hold still.
It's not the end of the world.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.175
Did you see that?

11:20.175 --> 11:21.230
It's just a little mud.

11:21.230 --> 11:24.032
No. She moved her seat forward.

11:24.032 --> 11:26.974
When she got in the car,
she moved her seat.

11:41.362 --> 11:44.222
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was my office.

11:44.222 --> 11:47.219
Yeah, see, I'm confused because
my name is on the door.

11:47.219 --> 11:49.201
Don't... Don't blame Sharona, Captain.

11:49.201 --> 11:51.035
I have no intention of blaming Sharona.

11:51.035 --> 11:53.320
I was just following up on the Ashcombe case.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.248
What happened here?

11:54.248 --> 11:56.318
I took the liberty of
straightening up a little.

11:56.318 --> 11:59.272
- Where is all my crap?
- It's in your drawers.

11:59.272 --> 12:02.104
And, of course,
I had to throw some stuff away.

12:02.368 --> 12:06.053
I'm sorry, sir. I tried to stop him, but...

12:06.053 --> 12:09.915
There is no Ashcombe case, Monk.

12:10.175 --> 12:12.328
The inquest is over.

12:12.328 --> 12:13.413
This is what happened.

12:13.413 --> 12:15.797
It was raining.
She was a terrible driver.

12:15.797 --> 12:17.947
She went off the road.

12:18.161 --> 12:20.465
A mud slide covered the car until..

12:20.465 --> 12:25.070
Until the biggest flake
in North America just happened to find it.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.760
And you can't stand that, can you?

12:28.335 --> 12:31.983
Dolly Flint... showed you up,

12:31.983 --> 12:34.503
and you can't stand it.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.774
Adrian, sit!

12:37.728 --> 12:39.523
We have Dolly Flint's file.

12:39.523 --> 12:42.230
I know she has a jacket.
I made three of those collars myself.

12:42.230 --> 12:44.618
Fraud, trespassing, reckless endangerment.

12:44.618 --> 12:47.246
Yeah, she has a sleep disorder.
She walks in her sleep.

12:47.246 --> 12:49.945
She's got, um...
what do you call it... som...

12:49.945 --> 12:54.808
Do you know how many cases
Dolly Flint offered to help with and failed?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.691
Two hundred and twenty.

12:56.691 --> 12:59.635
So, she's one for 220.

12:59.635 --> 13:00.861
It's possible.

13:00.861 --> 13:03.272
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

13:03.635 --> 13:08.409
She was photographed...
going through a red light last night.

13:08.409 --> 13:10.400
She was alone in the car.

13:14.192 --> 13:16.272
It happened.

13:24.995 --> 13:26.990
I'm not good at parties.

13:26.990 --> 13:31.025
It's not a party. It's a memorial service.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.558
This is a nice place.

13:35.730 --> 13:38.688
Obviously, whoever lives here
doesn't work for you.

13:38.688 --> 13:41.980
The late Mrs. Ashcombe
was richer than Canada.

13:42.481 --> 13:47.146
Commissioner, I thought this might help.

13:47.516 --> 13:51.235
When I lost Trudy, l...
I read it every night.

13:51.235 --> 13:53.258
"Ralph Waldo Emerson."

13:53.258 --> 13:56.312
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Adrian.

13:56.563 --> 13:58.364
And thank you for coming.

13:58.364 --> 14:00.846
It means the world to me.

14:01.415 --> 14:04.801
It looks like we won't require
your services after all.

14:04.801 --> 14:08.361
But I want you to know how much
I appreciate your offer.

14:11.287 --> 14:12.452
Thank you.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.793
- Hold on.
- No, no, bathroom. Bathroom!

14:16.793 --> 14:18.863
- I need to wash.
- Just try upstairs.

14:18.863 --> 14:20.565
Did you see that?
It was a two-hander.

14:20.565 --> 14:23.647
I saw it. Just don't make a scene.

15:18.289 --> 15:20.071
The guest bathroom is down the hall.

15:20.071 --> 15:22.305
Commissioner! I'm sorry.

15:22.305 --> 15:23.550
Uh, I was...

15:23.791 --> 15:26.892
I was, uh... I was... I was just...

15:26.892 --> 15:29.463
I mean, later... after...

15:29.463 --> 15:32.915
you know, before when we... l...

15:32.915 --> 15:34.057
Okay, here's the thing.

15:34.057 --> 15:37.070
I can remember when
you began this sentence.

15:37.913 --> 15:39.392
Everyone gets lost.

15:39.392 --> 15:41.420
The house was always
too big for Katherine and me.

15:41.420 --> 15:44.615
We didn't buy it.
It was a wedding gift from her father.

15:44.615 --> 15:45.418
Ah.

15:47.130 --> 15:49.191
You understand, right?

15:49.191 --> 15:52.074
I mean, you lost your wife.

15:53.361 --> 15:56.434
Uh, understand what, sir?

15:56.625 --> 15:58.803
The natural desire to pack
her things away.

15:58.803 --> 16:02.289
You don't want them around to...
remind you.

16:02.289 --> 16:05.373
I guess I had the opposite reaction.

16:05.726 --> 16:09.037
I haven't thrown anything
of Trudy's away.

16:09.557 --> 16:11.480
Not even a hairbrush.

16:11.674 --> 16:16.053
Not even a hair from a hairbrush.

16:16.708 --> 16:17.963
Really?

16:22.964 --> 16:26.688
So, uh, what, he leaves the house
like twice a week now?

16:26.969 --> 16:29.623
What kind of question is that, hmm?

16:29.623 --> 16:32.180
He leaves the house all the time.
He's not disabled.

16:32.180 --> 16:33.964
He just gets a little anxious about...

16:33.964 --> 16:35.561
Every single thing.

16:36.205 --> 16:39.108
Well, you know, the fact is...

16:39.108 --> 16:43.365
we're getting offers from
all over the country every day.

16:43.365 --> 16:45.923
I had to disconnect my phone.
It was driving me crazy.

16:45.923 --> 16:46.897
Sure.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.473
What are you doing?

17:06.473 --> 17:07.894
You can't look through people's mail.

17:07.894 --> 17:11.396
I'm not stealing anything.
I'm just combing through.

17:11.396 --> 17:15.868
I don't wanna live in a world
where a person can't comb through another person's mail.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.137
Just hurry up.

17:18.441 --> 17:21.208
"Jennie Zeppettelli."

17:22.217 --> 17:25.344
Smell that. Perfume.

17:25.624 --> 17:28.232
Shalimar. It's very expensive.

17:28.454 --> 17:30.692
Obviously, an old girlfriend.

17:30.909 --> 17:33.605
She loved him, but it's over now.

17:33.605 --> 17:35.633
How do you know all that?

17:35.826 --> 17:39.760
I've never underlined anything
six times. Have you?

17:58.281 --> 18:00.114
I agree, Jennifer.

18:00.744 --> 18:03.419
He did waste the best five years of your life.

18:03.419 --> 18:05.600
How did you know what I was thinking?

18:06.414 --> 18:09.510
You were looking at the empty bottles
of Beaujolais.

18:09.510 --> 18:12.167
They're dated, one for each of
the last five years.

18:12.167 --> 18:15.534
They obviously represent anniversaries.

18:15.534 --> 18:19.480
And I saw you feel your ring finger,
which doesn't have a ring.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.200
Are you a psychic, Mr. Monk?

18:22.200 --> 18:25.150
He is a psychic who doesn't
believe in psychics.

18:25.150 --> 18:30.371
Jennifer, we know you were having
an affair with Harry Ashcombe.

18:32.092 --> 18:35.647
- Is it over?
- I wised up.

18:35.956 --> 18:38.305
It only took five years.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.568
I realized Harry was never
gonna leave his wife.

18:41.568 --> 18:45.269
And not because he loved her.
I mean, he despised her.

18:45.534 --> 18:47.574
He just couldn't live without the money.

18:47.574 --> 18:49.274
When did you see him last?

18:49.274 --> 18:51.227
About four months ago.

18:51.227 --> 18:54.898
But he calls me all the time
and he sends me gifts.

18:54.898 --> 18:58.756
I mean, what happened to his wife,
it wasn't my fault. He's just...

18:58.756 --> 19:00.289
He's crazy.

19:00.461 --> 19:02.602
You mean the accident?

19:05.557 --> 19:07.792
You don't believe it was an accident?

19:07.792 --> 19:08.861
I don't know.

19:08.861 --> 19:12.786
All I know is that Harry Ashcombe
is a very dangerous man.

19:14.276 --> 19:16.618
I hope you know what you're doing.

19:18.377 --> 19:19.957
Do we know what we're doing?

19:19.957 --> 19:23.447
Relax. I've been handling refrigerators
since I was 15.

19:23.447 --> 19:25.723
No. I'm talkin' about the case.

19:25.723 --> 19:29.035
The former commissioner isn't just
another suspect, Adrian.

19:29.035 --> 19:33.736
He is connected. He is the man,
and you better be sure about this.

19:33.736 --> 19:36.254
I'm as sure as I can be...

19:36.254 --> 19:39.264
without any, you know, proof.

19:40.028 --> 19:43.170
All ofher stuff was packed up.

19:43.170 --> 19:44.833
He couldn't wait to get rid of it.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.813
But that doesn't mean anything.

19:46.813 --> 19:49.722
There were boots in the closet that
were covered with mud.

19:50.806 --> 19:53.536
"Good until July 22."

19:54.160 --> 19:57.434
"Sell by July 20."

20:00.931 --> 20:03.366
You really think he forced his wife
off the road?

20:03.366 --> 20:06.419
- Yep.
- Any idea how?

20:06.613 --> 20:08.351
Unless I'm crazy,

20:08.351 --> 20:12.150
he put something on the road that
sent her over the side.

20:12.150 --> 20:14.658
Now, that was the easy part.

20:14.658 --> 20:16.510
The hard part came later.

20:16.510 --> 20:17.993
What's that?

20:19.389 --> 20:24.136
Getting that loony tune,
Dolly Flint, to find the body.

20:24.136 --> 20:26.896
That's the real mystery here.

20:27.423 --> 20:30.304
- How did he do that?
- Well, you can ask her.

20:30.304 --> 20:32.964
I got a reading with her at 3:00.

20:33.158 --> 20:34.867
Why don't you come along?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.823
Maybe I will.

20:41.029 --> 20:42.530
Hmm.

20:43.786 --> 20:45.945
Very positive person.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.401
Very spiritual.

20:47.401 --> 20:49.378
That's true. / Mm-hmm.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.862
Hmm. But you've been troubled.

20:51.862 --> 20:54.595
You're having trouble sleeping.
Am I right?

20:54.595 --> 20:56.549
Yeah. Yeah. / Uh-huh.

20:56.549 --> 20:58.432
You can tell all that from the bumps
in my head?

20:58.432 --> 20:59.931
It's called phrenology.

20:59.931 --> 21:03.547
See, the shape of your head is
like a spiritual road map.

21:03.547 --> 21:07.207
- You just have to know how to read it.
- Feels good.

21:07.207 --> 21:10.581
Shh. Okay.

21:10.581 --> 21:12.134
There's a young man in your life.

21:12.134 --> 21:16.131
That would be my son.
His name's Benjy. / Oh.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.293
And another man.

21:18.293 --> 21:21.859
He's not young, but he's...
he's like a child.

21:21.859 --> 21:24.381
That would be my boss. / Mmm.

21:24.564 --> 21:26.509
This is a very difficult man.

21:26.509 --> 21:29.661
- He's causing you a lot of anxiety.
- Yeah.

21:29.661 --> 21:33.107
I just don't wanna talk about him
right now, please? / Okay, all right.

21:33.107 --> 21:36.291
Yeah, this is another man... a new man.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.235
- Oh, honey, this is a real man.
- Really?

21:39.235 --> 21:40.304
Yeah.

21:44.029 --> 21:45.739
What was that?

21:45.739 --> 21:48.375
Wait. Let's... Let's talk about that man.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.075
Where's your friend, Mr. Monk?

21:58.183 --> 21:59.909
Mr. Monk.

22:01.064 --> 22:03.576
I thought you were in the waiting room.

22:04.044 --> 22:06.060
I was thirsty.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.097
Yeah? Well, you should have asked.

22:09.230 --> 22:10.383
Excuse the mess.

22:10.383 --> 22:13.864
My cleaning girl got herself knocked up
by some guy from Paraguay.

22:13.864 --> 22:15.311
Can you believe it?

22:16.763 --> 22:20.161
What do they call them anyway,
"Paraguians"?

22:20.161 --> 22:21.786
Here you go.

22:22.997 --> 22:24.300
You know what? I'm fine.

22:24.300 --> 22:28.350
It was... It was just a cough... drop...

22:28.350 --> 22:30.999
stuck in my throat there,
but I'm fine now.

22:30.999 --> 22:32.953
- Thank you.
- Suit yourself.

22:35.027 --> 22:37.257
Why don't you come and join us?

22:37.652 --> 22:40.441
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:40.768 --> 22:45.297
The Chariot.
You are a very restless soul.

22:46.063 --> 22:49.464
Oh. Now this is interesting.
The Knight of Pentacles.

22:49.464 --> 22:50.328
Is that good?

22:50.328 --> 22:53.862
Well, it confirms what I felt earlier...
romance.

22:53.862 --> 22:56.692
You know anyone with a British accent?

22:56.692 --> 22:59.622
- No.
- You will... very soon.

23:00.021 --> 23:02.452
A British accent, huh?

23:02.452 --> 23:05.250
He's not gonna look like that, is he?

23:06.035 --> 23:08.549
No, I don't think so.

23:08.854 --> 23:11.094
No, he's gonna be tall,

23:11.094 --> 23:15.580
and his name is Derek... David.

23:15.580 --> 23:18.260
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll both be deliriously happy.

23:18.260 --> 23:21.006
Miss Flint, about finding Mrs. Ashcombe...

23:21.006 --> 23:25.224
I didn't find anybody.
Her spirit led me to her.

23:25.224 --> 23:26.735
Of course.
Yeah, of course.

23:26.735 --> 23:30.413
Did you know her before she died?

23:30.413 --> 23:33.387
No, I never met her, and I've been
through this about a million times.

23:33.387 --> 23:35.978
- No, I understand...
- Excuse me.

23:36.435 --> 23:39.989
Um, about the man with the accent,
how will I know it's him?

23:39.989 --> 23:42.077
Oh, well, you'll know, like all women know.

23:42.077 --> 23:44.757
You just have to keep an open heart, Sharona.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.520
- So, she wasn't a client?
- No.

23:49.435 --> 23:51.750
Uh, Dolly? You said soon.

23:51.750 --> 23:55.558
You mean, like this week
or next week? / Um...

23:55.558 --> 23:58.508
I'd say before the next full moon.

23:58.508 --> 24:02.734
I'm sorry, but, uh, uh,
here on the planet Earth,

24:02.734 --> 24:07.267
there's a dead woman and...
somebody is responsible.

24:07.267 --> 24:10.208
It was an accident, Mr. Monk.
She drove off the highway.

24:10.208 --> 24:14.967
Right. What exactly do you remember
about that night?

24:14.967 --> 24:16.281
Do you know what you are, Mr. Monk?

24:16.281 --> 24:19.701
You are, what we in the spiritual
world call, a "buzz kill."

24:19.701 --> 24:21.262
Thank you. / Fine!

24:21.473 --> 24:22.520
It's your money.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.482
I went to bed. I have insomnia.
I took my pills.

24:25.482 --> 24:28.749
I finally got to sleep at about, uh, 3:00.

24:28.749 --> 24:31.867
No, it was 3:30.
I was watching Law & Order.

24:31.867 --> 24:33.120
Go on.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.489
And that's it. I woke up next to
Mrs. Ashcombe.

24:36.489 --> 24:39.783
Now I go to bed with my coat
on holding my car keys, just in case.

24:39.783 --> 24:41.660
Okay, are you happy now?

24:41.660 --> 24:43.512
You happy? Dolly?

24:43.512 --> 24:46.997
Dolly, what does he do, like,
for a living? He has a job, right?

24:46.997 --> 24:49.127
- Sharona, please, please.
- What?

24:49.127 --> 24:53.267
I'm... I'm working here.
I'm working here.

24:56.751 --> 24:59.117
What did you do?
Are you insane?

24:59.117 --> 25:02.089
- I need... I need a wipe.
- In the car.

25:02.089 --> 25:04.037
Don't do this to me.
Give me a wipe here.

25:04.037 --> 25:06.872
Go to the car and get the wipes.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.819
Go to the car.

25:10.340 --> 25:11.151
Um...

25:11.151 --> 25:15.230
About this David or Derek,
he's not married, is he?

26:02.223 --> 26:03.772
What is he doing?

26:03.772 --> 26:07.851
I don't know.
Did you finish all your math?

26:09.269 --> 26:11.153
You have a weird job.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.594
Benjy, just finish the math.

26:44.752 --> 26:46.654
Mr. Monk, you were right.

26:46.654 --> 26:49.447
- It's a perfect match.
- Really?

26:49.447 --> 26:52.026
They're made by a company called
Decorative Gravel.

26:52.026 --> 26:55.169
Now that particular color is
called Volcanic Tuff.

26:55.169 --> 26:57.171
It's not very popular.
It's from New Mexico.

26:57.171 --> 26:58.546
I talked to the bookkeeper,

26:58.546 --> 27:01.738
and she said they only did one,
maybe two driveways in the area.

27:01.738 --> 27:04.346
So, if this came from somebody's car,

27:04.346 --> 27:07.165
and this one came from
somebody's driveway...

27:07.165 --> 27:09.685
At some point, that car was
on that driveway.

27:09.685 --> 27:11.132
You can bet the farm.

27:11.132 --> 27:14.095
Customer service to paint department, please.

27:14.095 --> 27:15.507
So?

27:15.941 --> 27:19.405
Ashcombe said he never met Dolly Flint,

27:19.405 --> 27:21.846
and she said she never met him.

27:22.051 --> 27:24.593
Maybe they both just forgot.

27:29.674 --> 27:33.410
Nobody move.
Nobody move!

27:33.632 --> 27:35.005
Hello.

27:36.124 --> 27:40.322
Hello. My name is Adrian... Monk.

27:40.322 --> 27:45.120
I'm working with the police
on a homicide investigation.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.091
There is a very valuable
piece of evidence...

27:48.091 --> 27:50.829
somewhere in this store.

27:50.829 --> 27:53.576
It's a small pebble.

27:54.107 --> 27:56.745
It's about the size...

27:56.745 --> 27:58.553
of a...

28:00.197 --> 28:02.202
small pebble.

28:03.250 --> 28:07.054
If you could all just...
just stop, please,

28:07.054 --> 28:09.705
and look around...

28:09.705 --> 28:12.874
What... What... What are you doing?

28:14.896 --> 28:16.261
Sweeping up.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.533
Okay, where's the rest of it?

28:22.752 --> 28:26.342
- It's not in here.!
- Keep looking.

28:26.342 --> 28:30.210
It's a small, black pebble. God!

28:39.902 --> 28:44.094
Wait a minute. I found it.

28:44.094 --> 28:45.759
- I found it.
- Where was it?

28:45.759 --> 28:47.341
It was in my...

28:47.341 --> 28:50.380
It must've... It must've flown.

28:50.566 --> 28:51.981
God!

28:52.343 --> 28:56.014
I don't believe I listen to you.!
You're driving me nuts.!

29:01.413 --> 29:03.776
Adrian, are you sure about this?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.048
Well, no.

29:05.335 --> 29:08.109
You better be right.
I swear, I'll kill you.

29:09.505 --> 29:11.861
Monk! What are you doing here?

29:11.861 --> 29:15.369
Your housekeeper said we might
find you here. Is the dog okay?

29:15.369 --> 29:17.987
The dog's fine. Actually,
I was just giving her away.

29:17.987 --> 29:19.770
Oh, my God. Why?

29:19.770 --> 29:22.864
Well, she was Katherine's dog.
I'm not much of a pet person.

29:22.864 --> 29:26.567
She'll be... happier here.

29:27.270 --> 29:31.587
You, uh... You...
You didn't return my calls.

29:31.587 --> 29:35.804
Well, I assumed they were more calls
of condolences. Was I wrong?

29:35.804 --> 29:39.420
L... l... I had a couple questions,

29:39.420 --> 29:41.271
uh, about your wife's death.

29:41.271 --> 29:44.677
Well, I send you a transcript of
the inquest and the coroner's report.

29:44.677 --> 29:46.548
Anything else?

29:47.244 --> 29:51.318
She... She was insured,
wasn't she? / Yes.

29:51.318 --> 29:54.060
There was a $2 million
accidental death policy.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.012
Now, I know that seems like
a lot of money to some people,

29:56.012 --> 29:58.126
but considering the lifestyle
that we enjoyed,

29:58.126 --> 30:00.656
it was not at all excessive.

30:00.656 --> 30:03.568
- Is there anything else?
- I found this...

30:03.568 --> 30:06.828
this piece of gravel in the tire of your car.

30:06.828 --> 30:13.061
And, uh, it matches the gravel...
outside the psychic's house.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.179
Can you explain that?

30:15.384 --> 30:16.662
Are they unique?

30:16.662 --> 30:18.756
Oh. Yes, very.

30:21.964 --> 30:24.066
I don't have to explain it.

30:24.066 --> 30:26.228
Can you explain it?

30:28.335 --> 30:29.773
Not yet.

30:30.250 --> 30:34.474
You know, it's no big deal, sir.
We were just curious about the gravel.

30:34.474 --> 30:38.038
Uh, Adrian, I think we better go.
We're gonna be late.

30:38.038 --> 30:40.050
You'd better listen to her, Monk.

30:42.824 --> 30:44.878
You're in my way.

30:44.878 --> 30:46.403
That's right.

30:46.709 --> 30:48.188
I am.

30:50.774 --> 30:53.568
Dolly? Ready to go in five minutes.

30:53.568 --> 30:54.744
Okay.

30:55.755 --> 30:57.463
What do you want from me, Monk?

30:57.463 --> 31:00.015
Did that director have a British accent?

31:00.015 --> 31:01.297
I think so.

31:01.297 --> 31:02.736
What's his name?

31:02.948 --> 31:04.705
Forget it. He's gay.

31:04.705 --> 31:07.282
He doesn't know it yet, but forget it.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.360
What do you want from me, Monk?

31:08.360 --> 31:09.670
How 'bout the truth for a change?

31:09.670 --> 31:11.253
I have been telling you the truth.

31:11.253 --> 31:14.195
Okay? I fell asleep.
I woke up. Hello!

31:14.195 --> 31:15.570
There's Mrs. Ashcombe.

31:15.570 --> 31:18.383
There's no smoking.
There's no smoking.

31:18.383 --> 31:21.063
- I believe you, Dolly.
- Thank you, sweetie.

31:21.063 --> 31:24.158
- What's his problem?
- My problem is simple.

31:24.158 --> 31:25.577
It's not possible.

31:25.577 --> 31:27.108
Well, how do you explain it then?

31:27.108 --> 31:31.073
Miss Flint, this is not a game.
If you are somehow involved...

31:31.073 --> 31:33.371
Involved? How?

31:33.371 --> 31:35.359
With your friend, Harry Ashcombe.

31:35.359 --> 31:38.650
I met the man once for 30 seconds.
You were there!

31:38.650 --> 31:40.324
He's been to your house.

31:40.324 --> 31:41.910
- Impossible.
- I can prove it.

31:41.910 --> 31:43.875
I think I'd remember.

31:44.285 --> 31:48.123
Dolly, we're talking about premeditated,
first-degree murder.

31:48.123 --> 31:52.530
I think Ashcombe killed his wife,
and then recruited you to find the body.

31:52.530 --> 31:55.072
That's accessory after the fact,
aiding and abetting...

31:55.072 --> 31:56.704
these are very serious charges.

31:56.704 --> 31:59.090
- I am not a criminal.
- I've seen your rap sheet.

31:59.090 --> 32:01.024
You're not exactly Mother Teresa.

32:01.024 --> 32:04.519
That is just nickel-and-dime stuff.
Come on.!

32:06.398 --> 32:07.385
You wanna know the truth?

32:07.385 --> 32:09.520
I'm not sure my heart could take it.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.378
Come here.

32:12.901 --> 32:16.787
Mr. Monk, when I woke up on that hill,

32:16.787 --> 32:19.240
I couldn't believe it myself.

32:19.738 --> 32:24.082
The truth is... I'm a fake.

32:24.616 --> 32:27.768
I never really had the gift.
Don't tell the girl.

32:27.768 --> 32:30.339
I wanted it. I pretended to have it.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.830
Once in a while when I was a kid,
I thought I actually did have it.

32:32.830 --> 32:35.907
But the only gift I had was telling people
what they wanted to hear.

32:35.907 --> 32:39.164
It was a sham my entire life.

32:40.756 --> 32:42.758
Until Tuesday.

32:43.447 --> 32:45.607
That was the real deal, Monk.

32:45.607 --> 32:51.291
I swear on my sainted mother's eyes,
Mrs. Ashcombe led me to that car.

32:51.291 --> 32:53.531
I always wanted to help the cops, you know.

32:53.531 --> 32:56.815
Like really help them on a big case.
And I did it!

32:56.815 --> 32:58.661
Maybe I'm just a late bloomer.

32:58.661 --> 33:01.943
Whatever the case,
this time I am telling you the truth.

33:01.943 --> 33:05.828
We got a break in an hour.
Let's try and get it together, please.

33:05.828 --> 33:07.928
- What is wrong?
- You wanna know what's wrong?

33:07.928 --> 33:09.813
I'll tell you what's wrong.

33:10.704 --> 33:12.293
I believe you.

33:16.316 --> 33:17.653
Hello?

33:17.857 --> 33:21.758
- Have you been talking to the police?
- No.

33:22.302 --> 33:24.741
Don't lie to me, Jennie.

33:33.583 --> 33:34.468
Hey, Monk.

33:35.375 --> 33:37.468
Monk, I've been looking for you.

33:37.468 --> 33:39.027
How did you know we were here?

33:39.027 --> 33:40.385
Sharona's kid told me.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.923
I have a message for you.

33:41.923 --> 33:45.179
Benjy wants to have a sleepover
at Drew Cunningham's house.

33:45.179 --> 33:47.213
- Are his parents gonna be home?
- I don't know.

33:47.213 --> 33:50.287
- Did he call from Drew's?
- I have no idea.

33:50.287 --> 33:52.848
You've been talking to the commissioner.

33:55.552 --> 33:57.814
- Where did you park?
- Where did I park?

33:57.814 --> 34:00.968
I parked up top.
Monk, I told you not to talk to him.

34:00.968 --> 34:03.378
The man just buried his wife.

34:03.378 --> 34:05.325
Why didn't you take the service road?

34:05.325 --> 34:06.475
It comes all the way down.

34:06.475 --> 34:07.537
I couldn't find it.

34:07.537 --> 34:10.070
The last time I was here,
I had a driver, okay?

34:10.070 --> 34:12.995
Couldn't find it.
Yeah, neither could we.

34:13.286 --> 34:15.802
- So what?
- Dolly Flint found it.

34:15.802 --> 34:19.465
She'd never been here before,
and she found it.

34:19.465 --> 34:21.904
Before dawn? How is that possible?

34:21.904 --> 34:23.964
She's psychic.

34:23.964 --> 34:27.379
A little bird told her.
I don't know. / Leland.

34:27.379 --> 34:30.780
I'm talking to the best cop I know.
You gotta get on board here.

34:30.780 --> 34:33.001
Ashcombe was sleeping around.

34:33.001 --> 34:34.168
That's common knowledge.

34:34.168 --> 34:36.705
Sharona, could you take a break, please?

34:36.893 --> 34:38.712
Please?

34:44.482 --> 34:46.530
He had muddy boots in his closet.

34:46.530 --> 34:49.024
I have muddy boots in my closet.

34:49.391 --> 34:52.898
Look, I knew you were crazy,
but I didn't know you were suicidal.

34:52.898 --> 34:58.024
Did you accuse Harry Ashcombe
of murder to his face?

34:58.982 --> 35:01.436
Not in so many words.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.861
Well, there goes your career.

35:04.861 --> 35:06.693
What career? / Exactly.

35:06.693 --> 35:08.698
And you wonder why
you're not wearing a badge.

35:08.698 --> 35:10.326
Here's what happened.

35:10.326 --> 35:13.495
Ashcombe did his wife,
but he had a problem.

35:13.495 --> 35:17.169
There was a mud slide that night.
The car was buried.

35:17.169 --> 35:20.115
He couldn't collect a dime
until they found her.

35:20.115 --> 35:21.294
What could he do?

35:21.294 --> 35:24.551
He couldn't just say,
"Maybe we should dig over there."

35:24.763 --> 35:28.778
Somebody else had to find her.

35:28.778 --> 35:31.285
- So he paid Dolly Flint?
- Too dangerous.

35:31.285 --> 35:33.537
She'd never keep her mouth shut.

35:33.873 --> 35:35.550
Ashcombe...

35:36.108 --> 35:40.119
arranged for her to find the body.

35:40.119 --> 35:42.705
Right.
But how did he do that?

35:43.533 --> 35:45.147
I think I know.

35:46.493 --> 35:48.572
Can you prove it?

35:49.600 --> 35:51.700
Only if you help me.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.961
Everyone, please concentrate.

36:04.322 --> 36:07.148
- Ah, it's faint.
- What is this?

36:07.148 --> 36:07.900
It's coming through.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.745
Leland, what's going on here?
Who let you in?

36:10.745 --> 36:13.349
You did. I talked to your lawyer, Harry.

36:13.349 --> 36:15.001
We have full unrestricted access.

36:15.001 --> 36:16.585
I thought you were just gonna look around.

36:16.585 --> 36:18.580
Shh, please.

36:18.995 --> 36:21.720
Her aura is very strong.

36:22.082 --> 36:23.615
She's here.

36:23.822 --> 36:25.633
I can feel her.

36:25.633 --> 36:27.301
Complete the ring.

36:34.082 --> 36:37.013
Mr. Monk, complete the ring.

36:37.770 --> 36:40.039
Uh, I think the ring is fine.

36:40.619 --> 36:42.960
Mr. Monk, we need you.

36:45.276 --> 36:47.421
Complete the ring.

36:54.657 --> 36:56.525
Who am I speaking to?

36:56.525 --> 36:59.292
Tell me. What is your name?

36:59.457 --> 37:03.118
There's a woman reported
missing in San Anselmo.

37:03.118 --> 37:06.756
A travel agent.
A 32-year-old Jennie Zeppettelli.

37:06.756 --> 37:08.987
Jennie? / Yeah.

37:09.208 --> 37:12.258
We contacted Miss Flint after
the success she had with your wife.

37:12.258 --> 37:14.146
- We thought we'd use her again.
- And?

37:14.146 --> 37:15.171
And...

37:15.171 --> 37:17.398
she's been on her trail all day.

37:17.398 --> 37:20.166
We followed her here.
We think she's in your house.

37:20.523 --> 37:22.718
- You can't be serious.
- Jennie?

37:23.609 --> 37:25.764
Is that you?

37:25.991 --> 37:27.563
She's here.

37:28.052 --> 37:30.490
Oh, she's in pain.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.808
I can feel her.

37:41.515 --> 37:44.200
There's something in this room.

37:46.115 --> 37:47.389
Look!

37:47.626 --> 37:49.462
Sharona, don't touch it!

37:57.066 --> 37:58.578
A sandal, size six.

37:58.578 --> 38:00.078
- What?
- According to her sister,

38:00.078 --> 38:02.899
she was wearing sandals
when she disappeared.

38:02.899 --> 38:05.434
- Is that blood?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

38:05.434 --> 38:06.772
- Bag it.
- This is insane!

38:06.772 --> 38:08.386
How did that get here?

38:08.386 --> 38:11.141
She's close.
She's very close.

38:12.922 --> 38:14.251
Are you all right?

38:14.251 --> 38:17.085
Stay away. It's Jennie.
She's here.

38:17.085 --> 38:18.957
There's nothing here!

38:22.772 --> 38:25.400
What is it, Dolly?
What is it?

38:28.677 --> 38:29.893
It's blood.

38:33.230 --> 38:34.498
And hair.

38:35.698 --> 38:37.508
Human.

38:37.508 --> 38:39.702
That's impossible.

38:39.702 --> 38:41.234
- Lieutenant.
- I got it.

38:41.524 --> 38:44.332
Jennie? She's calling me.

38:44.332 --> 38:45.729
I'm coming!

38:58.672 --> 39:01.620
Oh, no. Oh, my God.
Oh, dear God.

39:01.620 --> 39:04.730
No.! / Jennie.! Oh, my God.! I swear...

39:04.730 --> 39:08.108
Stand back, Commissioner.
This is a crime scene.

39:08.108 --> 39:10.283
He did it.
He killed her.

39:10.283 --> 39:13.306
Me? Are you crazy?
I loved this woman!

39:13.306 --> 39:14.901
He invited her here.

39:14.901 --> 39:17.156
She said it was over.
He exploded.

39:17.156 --> 39:20.243
She tried to run away,
but he chased her down.

39:20.243 --> 39:22.842
No! / He grabbed the poker.

39:22.842 --> 39:26.624
And then he straddled her,
and he was just pounding...

39:26.624 --> 39:27.814
just pounding her!

39:27.814 --> 39:30.335
- No, she's crazy!
- She says...

39:30.335 --> 39:32.948
now at least she can be with Abigail.

39:32.948 --> 39:37.081
Abigail is what she named her
unborn baby.

39:37.081 --> 39:41.545
Last summer,
you made her have an abortion.

39:41.944 --> 39:44.065
How do you know that?

39:44.065 --> 39:45.643
She knows everything.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.573
She's psychic.

39:48.573 --> 39:50.308
Leland, don't listen to her. This...

39:50.308 --> 39:52.446
This is some kind of a trick.!
She's a fake.!

39:52.446 --> 39:54.056
- She's not a fake.
- Yes, she is!

39:54.056 --> 39:56.546
- She found your wife's body.
- No, she didn't!

39:56.546 --> 39:58.031
- She did. I was there.
- No, no, no!

39:58.031 --> 40:01.456
She didn't find anything!
I drove her there!

40:08.344 --> 40:10.314
You drove her?

40:11.014 --> 40:13.340
Is that what you said?

40:13.340 --> 40:15.260
- Did you hear that, Captain?
- L... l...

40:15.260 --> 40:17.072
Look, Leland...

40:22.624 --> 40:27.293
Hello, Harry.
I told you you'd be sorry.

40:27.293 --> 40:30.171
When I told Jennie what
we were trying to do here,

40:30.171 --> 40:31.985
she was anxious to help.

40:32.470 --> 40:34.932
She knew you had to be stopped.

40:35.864 --> 40:37.914
A mud slide...

40:37.914 --> 40:40.029
that was your problem.

40:40.668 --> 40:45.362
Somebody other than yourself had
to find Katherine's body.

40:45.362 --> 40:50.266
So you went looking for
just the right psychic.

40:50.983 --> 40:53.529
And Dolly Flint was the perfect choice.

40:53.529 --> 40:57.140
From her file, you knew that
she took medication to help her sleep.

40:57.140 --> 41:01.891
What did you use, chloroform?
Something to keep her sleeping.

41:02.512 --> 41:04.138
You put on a wig.

41:04.422 --> 41:06.478
You drove her to the crash site.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.876
You even ran a red light or
two to make sure you were seen.

41:11.285 --> 41:15.241
In the morning, she woke up...

41:15.241 --> 41:17.315
and found your wife.

41:17.902 --> 41:19.780
I have nothing to say.

41:19.780 --> 41:21.631
That's quite all right, sir.

41:22.158 --> 41:24.126
You've said enough.

41:24.403 --> 41:27.978
Harry, I'm going to advise you of your rights.

41:28.317 --> 41:31.919
You have the right to remain silent.

41:31.919 --> 41:35.340
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court oflaw.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.072
How did you know she was a fake?

41:40.072 --> 41:43.529
Who? Dolly? Dolly Flint?
They're all fakes.

41:43.529 --> 41:45.968
You gotta be a little skeptical, Sharona,

41:45.968 --> 41:47.882
otherwise, you end up believing in everything...

41:47.882 --> 41:52.439
U.F.O. S, elves, income tax rebates.

41:52.439 --> 41:54.454
Well, it's better than believing in nothing.

41:54.454 --> 41:57.159
- I feel sorry for you.
- Thank you.

41:59.312 --> 42:02.185
- Don't pet... Don't pet... Don't pet...
- Oh, it's so... Come here.

42:02.185 --> 42:04.504
- Winston. Here, boy.
- Is he yours?

42:04.504 --> 42:07.243
- Yes, he is.
- What kind of dog is he?

42:07.243 --> 42:10.495
Not worth the trouble.
That's what kind.

42:11.174 --> 42:13.922
Are you British? / Guilty.

42:14.298 --> 42:15.235
Oh, God.

42:15.235 --> 42:16.954
I'm Sharona. / Hi.

42:16.954 --> 42:20.846
And this is my friend... Adrian.
Adrian Monk.

42:20.846 --> 42:23.304
And, um, you are?

42:23.304 --> 42:27.732
- Daniel.
- Oh, Daniel. With a "D."

42:27.923 --> 42:32.418
Adrian, I notice you touching all
the poles. Is that an American thing?

42:32.418 --> 42:34.822
Yes, that's an American tradition.

42:34.822 --> 42:38.653
I'm touching all the poles because
I'm proud to be an American.

42:40.138 --> 42:43.482
Excuse my asking,
but are you two together?

42:44.078 --> 42:46.322
Me... Me and Monk?

42:49.131 --> 42:51.460
No. No, we're not.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.355
It's not... It's not that funny.

42:53.825 --> 42:56.299
Yes, it is pretty funny.
