00:00.710 --> 00:02.253
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.462 --> 00:04.381
Could there be a better front
for a serial killer?

00:04.589 --> 00:06.716
<i>I mean, he can cremate
bodies, bury bodies.</i>

00:07.133 --> 00:08.843
Check out this Shady Plots
surveillance photo.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.345
That's Blaine,
but the other guy.

00:10.553 --> 00:11.972
- Doesn't it look like...
- Major.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.890
<i>There are zombies
living among us.</i>

00:14.099 --> 00:17.185
Those 322 people
are suspected zombies.

00:17.394 --> 00:19.104
- You want me to kill them?
- Yes.

00:19.312 --> 00:21.356
<i>You know,
the media's calling you
the Chaos Killer.</i>

00:21.564 --> 00:23.566
The vic who went
missing in Seward Park...

00:23.775 --> 00:25.944
<i>We just learned his pooch
had one of those
GPS tracking devices.</i>

00:26.152 --> 00:27.362
Blaine is selling Utopium.

00:27.570 --> 00:28.488
<i>He's taking on Mr. Boss.</i>

00:28.697 --> 00:29.906
Where to, boss?

00:30.115 --> 00:30.991
<i>Drake?
Working for Mr. Boss?</i>

00:31.199 --> 00:32.409
I've been dating a criminal.

00:32.617 --> 00:33.618
Boss' guys figured out
there's a rat.

00:33.827 --> 00:35.495
You're gonna
get me killed.

00:35.704 --> 00:36.746
<i>He's my star witness
against Mr. Boss.</i>

00:36.955 --> 00:38.581
<i>He's pretty much
the whole case.</i>

00:38.790 --> 00:39.457
You're here
because you need another
zombie for your freezer?

00:39.666 --> 00:40.875
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:41.084 --> 00:42.210
<i>- Drake Holloway.</i>
<i>- On the list.</i>

00:43.420 --> 00:45.296
- You're a zombie again?
- Yep.

00:45.505 --> 00:49.551
This is an
in-case-of-an-emergency
break-glass potential cure.

00:49.759 --> 00:50.927
<i>Well, hopefully it works.</i>

00:53.972 --> 00:57.684
What is your go-to
bagpipe player's
name again?

00:57.892 --> 00:59.561
I know it's Something
McSomething, but...

01:00.645 --> 01:01.604
Blaine?

01:08.153 --> 01:09.779
Come on.
Come on, man.

01:09.988 --> 01:11.990
Wake up, wake up!

01:12.198 --> 01:14.284
- Wake up!
- Oh! Hey.

01:14.492 --> 01:15.952
What's with
the manhandling?

01:16.161 --> 01:17.370
You were unconscious.

01:17.579 --> 01:19.414
Most people call that
sleeping, Scott E,

01:20.498 --> 01:21.791
but way to add the drama.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.251
It's Don E., Blaine.

01:24.544 --> 01:25.754
You just called me Scott E.

01:25.962 --> 01:26.880
Did I?

01:28.923 --> 01:31.968
Oh, in my defense,
you do look just like him.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.836
Oh, you guys can drop
the boxes right there.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.131
Hey, there.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.966
How happy are you
to have me back
as your roommate?

03:35.175 --> 03:36.050
Pretty damn happy.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.136
Mmm.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.804
Oh, we should really change
the locks, by the way.

03:44.976 --> 03:48.229
Yeah, there was this loud
tenant living above me who
my landlord refused to evict.

03:48.438 --> 03:50.231
Plus, I'm a lawyer, okay?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.650
If I can't get out
of a one-page lease,
I should be disbarred.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.863
What is happening
over there?

03:57.071 --> 03:59.073
I literally cannot
lift my arms.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.034
Why did I get all
the boxes of books?

04:01.242 --> 04:04.454
Because you made me
carry the furniture
all by myself.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.247
Oh, this is fun.

04:06.456 --> 04:08.082
Please, try and rent
the apartment
across the hall.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.335
So we can be like the friends
from <i>Friends</i>?

04:10.543 --> 04:11.753
Oh! Yes!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.504
Fantastic idea!

04:13.713 --> 04:15.506
Peyton is Monica-esque.

04:15.715 --> 04:17.342
You're clearly a Rachel.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.302
Type A.
Relationship drama.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.222
Yeah. Remember the
episode when Ross
and Rachel break up

04:22.430 --> 04:24.682
because she's a zombie
who wants to solve
murder cases?

04:24.891 --> 04:27.018
Mmm.
That was so us.

04:30.563 --> 04:31.564
Who's calling me
this late?

04:31.773 --> 04:32.899
Booty call.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.903
Or family emergency.

04:38.238 --> 04:39.405
Butt dial.

04:40.365 --> 04:41.658
Hello?

04:41.866 --> 04:43.326
That son-of-a-bitch-bastard
cheated on me!

04:43.534 --> 04:44.953
I caught him in the
parking lot during my break.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.079
I'm sorry, who is this?

04:46.287 --> 04:48.456
Cassidy. Kozlowski?

04:48.623 --> 04:50.458
<i>You gave me your card
a couple months ago.</i>

04:50.667 --> 04:52.669
You tried to get me to roll
over on Nick Costas,

04:52.877 --> 04:54.879
but I was all
<i>Stand By Your Man</i>
and crap.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.339
Cassidy. Yes.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.840
<i>You're Nick
"The Stick's" girlfriend.</i>

04:58.049 --> 05:01.386
Look, I know every
single criminal thing

05:01.594 --> 05:03.972
<i>that two-timing bucket-of-scum
has done, okay?</i>

05:04.180 --> 05:05.807
I got names.
Details.

05:06.015 --> 05:09.477
I know where a major
Mr. Boss stash house is.

05:09.686 --> 05:12.063
I want to destroy
Nick, okay?

05:12.272 --> 05:14.023
I want to flatten
his friggin' nuts

05:14.232 --> 05:17.402
in a friggin' vice
and use them as friggin'
air hockey pucks!

05:17.610 --> 05:18.778
You're doing
the right thing.

05:18.987 --> 05:20.863
<i>Go sit on a screw!</i>

05:21.072 --> 05:22.991
- Excuse me?
- That wasn't to you.
Hold on one sec.

05:23.199 --> 05:24.742
Some jerk's pulling over.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.745
I'm not hitchhiking, idiot!

05:31.332 --> 05:32.250
Cassidy?

05:34.919 --> 05:36.170
<i>Cassidy?</i>

06:04.365 --> 06:06.075
Bad news.

06:06.284 --> 06:08.494
One of our
eyewitnesses is dead

06:09.620 --> 06:12.123
and the other's
not talking.

06:12.332 --> 06:15.001
So, we know from
your DA friend

06:15.209 --> 06:17.712
that a car was
approaching before
Cassidy's phone cut out.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.255
I don't know.
Seems like somebody

06:19.464 --> 06:20.590
drove by
and whacked her head

06:20.798 --> 06:22.508
like a curb-side mailbox.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.385
Oh, so we're looking
for two people,

06:24.594 --> 06:26.554
the person driving the car
and the passenger
who did the swinging.

06:26.763 --> 06:29.223
Well, Cassidy's boyfriend
had some serious
probable cause.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.350
Yeah, Nick "the Stick."

06:30.558 --> 06:31.642
One of
Mr. Boss's guys.

06:31.851 --> 06:33.227
Lucky for us,
he's on probation

06:33.436 --> 06:35.229
and wears
a court-mandated
ankle monitor.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.606
I'm just waiting
to hear back

06:36.814 --> 06:38.566
on his whereabouts for
the time of the murder.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.318
Mmm. A guy with
an ankle monitor
gets a hot girlfriend.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.195
Yet some women won't
date a guy who wears Crocs.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.781
Babineaux.

06:46.491 --> 06:48.743
At least Cassidy knew
she was dating a criminal.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.162
I bet you think this
dead stripper's about you.
Don't you?

06:51.371 --> 06:53.581
I just can't believe
how stupid I was.

06:53.748 --> 06:55.666
I let myself believe
that Drake was a good guy

06:55.875 --> 06:57.377
because I wanted
him to be one.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.003
Now he's dropped
off the face of the earth

06:59.212 --> 07:00.671
and I can't find him
to break up with him

07:00.880 --> 07:02.715
or to confront him about
working for Mr. Boss.

07:02.924 --> 07:05.218
Liv, sometimes
closure's a bad thing.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.928
It didn't work out too well
for poor Cassidy.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.847
Nick's our guy.

07:10.056 --> 07:12.266
His ankle monitor puts
him at the time and place
of the murder.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.519
We'll use it
to track him down
and arrest him.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.646
Why can't they
all be this easy?

07:16.854 --> 07:18.189
Hooray for dumb criminals!

07:22.360 --> 07:24.529
I can't believe you're
passing up this opportunity.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.072
As I understand it,

07:26.280 --> 07:28.116
women pay top dollar
for pole dancing classes.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.826
No way.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.203
I've had my eye on the guy
in drawer number three.

07:32.412 --> 07:34.038
A terminally-ill
hiking enthusiast

07:34.247 --> 07:36.666
who committed suicide
so that he could go out
on his own terms.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.085
I mean,
the exercise'll be
good for me,

07:39.293 --> 07:40.962
quality time in the
great outdoors.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.923
No visions of gross men
putting their hands
all over me.

07:44.132 --> 07:45.049
Hey!

07:45.883 --> 07:46.968
Hi!

07:47.135 --> 07:48.886
Peyton, what
a pleasant surprise!

07:49.095 --> 07:50.430
If I had I known
you'd be dropping by,

07:50.638 --> 07:52.223
I would've worn
my less bloody lab coat.

07:52.432 --> 07:54.142
Never visiting
you at work again.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.853
I was hoping you
had something for me.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.813
From Cassidy?

07:59.021 --> 08:00.148
Have you
already eaten it?

08:02.942 --> 08:05.236
Oh. Is that her
brain there?

08:05.445 --> 08:07.405
I wasn't planning on it.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.907
We already know that her
boyfriend killed her, so...

08:10.116 --> 08:14.203
Liv, Cassidy has information
that's vital to the
Mr. Boss case.

08:14.412 --> 08:16.080
Information she
wanted me to have.

08:16.289 --> 08:20.001
She told me she knows
where a major
Mr. Boss stash house is.

08:20.209 --> 08:23.629
If you need to eat
a brain anyway,
you mind,

08:23.838 --> 08:24.922
eating Cassidy's?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.200
Okay. Where's the stash house?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.084
Anything about
Hong Kong suppliers?

09:02.293 --> 09:03.961
Or shipment schedules?

09:04.170 --> 09:06.047
- No.
- Hmm.

09:06.255 --> 09:09.383
Cassidy said she knew
every criminal thing
Nick was involved with.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.469
Maybe just start with that?

09:11.677 --> 09:12.803
I'm gonna start with
throwing this frickin' plate
across the room

09:13.012 --> 09:14.597
if you don't step
the hell off.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.932
Okay.

09:16.140 --> 09:17.975
I mean, you're
asking me a favor

09:18.184 --> 09:19.936
and you're all up
in my business.

09:20.144 --> 09:23.064
Uh, I believe the brain
is officially kicking in.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.398
That's great.

09:25.650 --> 09:28.194
Maybe try
closing your eyes.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.738
Focus on the phrase,
"Stash house."

09:32.406 --> 09:34.242
"Stash house."

09:36.327 --> 09:37.495
"Stash house."

09:38.704 --> 09:39.747
"Stash house."

09:39.956 --> 09:40.998
It's not about
focusing, okay?

09:41.207 --> 09:42.583
It's not Pop-A-Shot.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.877
I am gonna need something
to trigger the vision.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.921
Then let's just do that.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.381
Where should we go
to trigger you?

09:56.973 --> 09:58.766
Okay, so, what now?

09:58.933 --> 10:01.519
Now we enjoy
this awesome song.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.522
Did that dancer just
accept a tip with
her butt cheeks?

10:04.730 --> 10:06.315
That's just...

10:06.524 --> 10:07.650
I mean, how does she
even know how much
he gave her?

10:07.858 --> 10:09.443
Oh, she knows.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.112
We should come up
with a game plan.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.201
Anyone looking
for some company?

10:17.410 --> 10:20.079
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about.

10:20.288 --> 10:22.331
White and tight.

10:22.540 --> 10:23.958
Go make some
new friends, honey.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.169
Pasty-ass ho.

10:27.378 --> 10:28.713
You wanna go?

10:28.921 --> 10:30.631
I will kick you right back
to the trailer park

10:30.840 --> 10:32.425
where you used
to make out with your uncle.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.386
You need to come to daddy.

10:35.595 --> 10:36.679
No. No, she doesn't.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.806
- Liv!
- How much for a lap dance?

10:38.973 --> 10:40.641
- 20?
- I'm a lawyer.

10:40.850 --> 10:41.809
40?

10:42.018 --> 10:43.185
Oh, hey,
I'm a lawyer.

10:43.394 --> 10:45.062
Well, almost.

10:45.271 --> 10:48.399
I'm a 3L at U-Dub.
How much law school
debt are you in?

10:48.608 --> 10:49.483
Lots.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.193
Not me.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.988
Olivia. I like how your mouth
looks when you say that.

10:54.697 --> 10:55.740
Olivia.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.491
All right. Yeah,
we're done here.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.872
This is how you
trigger a vision?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.041
Yeah. No matter what
brain I'm on,

11:05.249 --> 11:09.253
I just sit on some
strange knuckle-nut's lap
and "Poof," vision!

11:10.963 --> 11:13.007
Look, you want a stripper
vision triggered?

11:13.215 --> 11:14.383
We're gonna have
to break a few eggs.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.470
Follow me.

11:18.804 --> 11:19.930
Uh...

11:20.139 --> 11:21.682
No, no, no.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.602
It's a lap dance.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.853
Low mileage.

11:26.062 --> 11:27.897
No knee to groin contact.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.231
I'm your best friend.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.068
Yeah. That's why
this is awkward.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.278
So, with some other
girl it would be fine?

11:35.821 --> 11:37.990
Wait. Do you not
find me attractive?

11:38.199 --> 11:39.367
What do you want
me to say?

11:39.575 --> 11:42.161
I want you to appreciate
how freakin' hot I am.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.664
- Okay.
- Why do have to make it
all emotional?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.749
I have a body, all right?

11:46.957 --> 11:49.126
Can't you just think
of me as a sexual object?

11:49.335 --> 11:50.878
Fine. Whatever.

11:51.087 --> 11:52.797
You want to back up
that booty, back it up.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.757
Let's see what you got.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.759
Oh, I'll show you
what I got.

11:56.967 --> 11:57.885
Oh, bring it.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.430
You know it's still
20 bucks, right?

12:06.644 --> 12:08.104
Ooh. Sorry.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.438
Uh, I didn't know
you were home.

12:09.647 --> 12:10.940
I was looking
for my nail clippers.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.359
Be honest, man.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.444
When I leave the house,
you like to try on my clothes
just to feel close to me.

12:15.653 --> 12:16.529
Sometimes.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.155
When did you
get a safe?

12:18.364 --> 12:19.782
I should get one,
shouldn't I?
Seems very adult and...

12:22.118 --> 12:23.369
Uh, is it fireproof?

12:23.577 --> 12:24.954
It's just a safe.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.414
Ooh, do you have room
in there for my green card

12:26.622 --> 12:28.249
- and my pristine...
- I don't. It's...

12:28.457 --> 12:29.959
Full...
It's lots of stuff.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.421
All right, then.
That's that.

12:55.985 --> 12:56.944
Clive?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.613
Seriously?

12:59.822 --> 13:02.158
They found Nick's
ankle monitor in
some tourist's backpack.

13:02.783 --> 13:03.701
Uh-huh.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.453
Do I need to get,

13:05.661 --> 13:06.954
"I'll tell you if I have
a vision," tattooed
on my forehead?

13:07.663 --> 13:09.206
Yes, Clive.

13:09.415 --> 13:11.459
All right. Okay. Bye.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.669
I heard.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.213
Rumor is Mr. Boss
has a go-to guy for
removing ankle monitors.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.632
You're so smart.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.468
You must be amazing
at your job.

13:22.261 --> 13:25.639
Liv, can we go find
the bar, please?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.768
Another text
from Blaine.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.770
He missed a meeting
we had this morning
to go over his testimony.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.730
Now he keeps leaving me
these bizarre messages.

13:32.938 --> 13:33.981
I'll have to go see him.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.274
I'll go with you.

13:35.483 --> 13:37.359
I want to ask him
about Drake. Ah!

13:37.568 --> 13:40.196
Did that bitch just
flick me in the face
with her pony tail?

13:40.404 --> 13:42.948
- I think it was an accident.
- It is on!

13:43.157 --> 13:46.494
I am gonna smack
the wet n wild
right off her face!

13:46.702 --> 13:48.746
Does it help for me to mention
this isn't really you?

13:50.206 --> 13:52.333
Hey! You in the stall!

13:52.500 --> 13:53.667
You're gonna flick me
in the grill

13:53.876 --> 13:54.877
with your cheap-ass

13:55.085 --> 13:56.253
wannabe-Ariana-Grande
clip-on

13:56.462 --> 13:58.172
and then just hide
in the bathroom?

13:58.714 --> 13:59.757
Hey!

14:04.345 --> 14:06.055
Nick!

14:06.263 --> 14:07.765
Open the door, Nick!

14:09.558 --> 14:10.726
Nick's not here.

14:10.935 --> 14:12.394
You need to get out of here!

14:12.603 --> 14:13.729
Now!

14:18.067 --> 14:20.236
Did you just...

14:20.444 --> 14:22.404
I saw the stash house.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.865
It had, like,
a reinforced steel door

14:25.074 --> 14:26.534
and a mailbox
labeled "Thompson."

14:26.742 --> 14:27.743
Did you get an address?

14:29.161 --> 14:30.496
It's just...

14:30.704 --> 14:31.914
Thompson? It's...

14:32.122 --> 14:33.249
Kind of a needle
in a haystack.

14:33.457 --> 14:34.750
Sorry there's legwork.

14:37.545 --> 14:41.590
Look, my friend
was just killed
and I'm really upset,

14:41.799 --> 14:42.716
okay?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.303
Oh. Hey.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.223
I'm so sorry.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.599
I'm Liv.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.893
This is Peyton.

14:53.102 --> 14:56.313
She's a district attorney,
and I'm the medical examiner
from the Seattle PD.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.065
We're looking into
Cassidy's death.

15:00.860 --> 15:01.986
Look...

15:02.194 --> 15:04.071
I know everyone
thinks it's Nick,

15:04.238 --> 15:05.823
but Cassidy had this
regular customer,

15:06.031 --> 15:08.325
and they got into
a massive fight last night.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.953
I mean, it was so bad
the bouncers
had to kick him out.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.413
And the only reason let him
back in tonight

15:12.580 --> 15:14.123
is 'cause he's, like,
famous or something.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.625
He's here? Now?

15:19.753 --> 15:20.880
There he is there.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.089
Got it.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.553
Johnny Frost.

15:28.596 --> 15:29.889
Oh, crap.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.647
Oh. Is that the weatherman
from the news?

15:44.737 --> 15:46.989
Cassidy was my ATF.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.824
All Time Favorite.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.492
But you fought
with Cassidy the
night she was killed.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.870
Okay, yeah,

15:53.078 --> 15:55.289
because I'd just discovered
she bilked me out of tens
of thousands of dollars

15:55.497 --> 15:56.540
through identity theft.

15:56.749 --> 15:57.917
She was pretending
to be you?

15:58.125 --> 16:00.169
She had my credit card
more than I did.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.837
My secret card.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.172
The one I use
for expenses

16:03.380 --> 16:04.757
I didn't want the wife
to know about,

16:04.965 --> 16:06.216
strip club tabs,

16:06.425 --> 16:09.011
porn site memberships,
trips to Bangkok.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.971
Anything that makes me happy.

16:11.180 --> 16:15.059
And then I get
a bill for $45,000.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.895
And lots of the charges
screamed stripper.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.231
Tattooed eyeliner,
laser hair removal...

16:21.440 --> 16:25.235
Chantilly lace plunge teddy
with a mesh Y-back.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.989
You know, we haven't
been properly introduced,
I'm Johnny...

16:31.450 --> 16:34.244
Look, I was upset because
Cassidy was stealing,

16:34.453 --> 16:36.246
but, we had a special bond.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.998
Truly.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.584
I'm not sure I'll ever
get over losing her.

16:40.793 --> 16:42.127
I'm free now,
Mr. Frost.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.921
Ready to hit
the champagne room?

16:44.129 --> 16:46.882
You'll have to excuse me.
Destiny is calling.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.051
Coming, Destiny.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.137
Can we go now?

16:52.346 --> 16:54.765
I feel like I want
to take a bunch of showers.

16:54.974 --> 16:56.141
We could
stop by Blaine's.

16:56.350 --> 16:58.268
Make that water
really earn its keep.

17:01.689 --> 17:02.731
Hi.

17:02.940 --> 17:03.816
We need to talk
to Blaine.

17:04.024 --> 17:04.942
Mind letting him
know we're here?

17:05.150 --> 17:06.026
He's not around.

17:06.235 --> 17:07.111
Sorry.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.237
When will he be back?

17:08.445 --> 17:09.905
It's hard to say.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.448
Because the words
are too big or because...

17:11.657 --> 17:14.118
- You know what...
- We have company!

17:14.326 --> 17:16.078
So much for
staying on the D.L.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.415
Can I interest you ladies
in a cup of decaf java?

17:19.623 --> 17:21.792
Organic, fair trade,
shade-grown,

17:22.001 --> 17:23.877
barely discernible
carbon footprint.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.796
There's going to be
a discernible carbon footprint

17:26.005 --> 17:27.589
on your ass if you
don't cut the crap.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.425
- Excuse me?
- Have you seen Drake lately?

17:30.551 --> 17:32.261
- Drake?
- No. Not for a few days.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.387
Do you know where he is?

17:33.595 --> 17:35.472
I genuinely don't know.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.307
Is there anything else
I can help you two with?

17:37.516 --> 17:39.184
You could not torpedo
our case against Mr. Boss,

17:40.310 --> 17:41.770
stop blowing off
our meetings.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.605
We need to discuss
your testimony.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.649
I'm sorry. We had
a meeting scheduled?

17:45.858 --> 17:46.775
Really?

17:50.863 --> 17:53.073
<i>Hi, this is Blaine. DeBeers.</i>

17:53.282 --> 17:54.742
<i>You're on my calendar today.</i>

17:54.950 --> 17:56.285
<i>Not sure what that's about.</i>

17:56.493 --> 17:57.494
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

17:57.703 --> 17:59.663
- I have four of those.
- Right.

17:59.872 --> 18:02.166
Right. I'm so sorry
for the inconvenience.

18:02.374 --> 18:03.792
Why are you acting
so weird?

18:04.001 --> 18:05.919
- What, are you high?
- Probably?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.297
Your immunity
does not come free.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.007
Pull yourself together,

18:10.215 --> 18:12.342
next time I call
to reschedule,
make yourself available.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.470
And when you see Drake,
tell him I'm looking for him.

18:25.439 --> 18:26.690
Mmm.

18:26.899 --> 18:28.525
Ugh! Milk's gone bad.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.069
Did it?
I just bought it yesterday.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.945
The world's
an imperfect place.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.536
Major, look at this.

18:40.871 --> 18:43.791
Doesn't that look like Minor?

18:43.999 --> 18:47.252
It just looks like
every other basset hound
in the world.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.545
Right, but the markings.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.047
Look at the timeline.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.257
Colin Andrews went missing
on November 13th.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.134
That's the day
you brought Minor home.

18:54.343 --> 18:56.386
Do you remember the exact day
I brought him home?

18:56.595 --> 18:59.056
Same day Peyton showed up
on our doorstep, so, yeah.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.391
- Ah.
- This is unbelievable.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.393
Maybe you should
call the police.

19:03.602 --> 19:04.895
It's possible you saw
the Chaos Killer
and you don't know it.

19:05.104 --> 19:06.939
Ravi, that's not even Minor.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.275
Colin Andrews's dog
Penny was found
on a bus on January 14th.

19:10.484 --> 19:13.403
Isn't that right around
the time you took
Minor back to his owner?

19:13.612 --> 19:14.780
How did he wind up
on a bus?

19:16.323 --> 19:17.491
I think, you're losing it,
my friend.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.659
That's not Minor.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.119
I gotta work.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.286
Uh, Major...

19:34.508 --> 19:36.677
Gonna lose a hand turning off
a girl's music like that.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.679
Detective Vega. Vice.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.264
I need a moment
of your time.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.807
What can I do
for you, Detective?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.684
We know you've been
dating Drake Holloway.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.894
We're trying to locate him.

19:46.103 --> 19:49.648
We had drinks
a couple nights ago
at The Snake Eye.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.108
I haven't heard
from him since.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.568
You sure about that?

19:52.776 --> 19:53.777
Yes.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.114
Let me know
if he contacts you.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.290
What was that about?

20:06.498 --> 20:08.208
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.960
You know, I'm having
trouble locating Nick.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.920
I could use some help
sussing out the other woman

20:12.129 --> 20:14.047
if you're not
otherwise occupied.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.051
Hey, ladies.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.469
Cops are here.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.513
They've got a couple of
questions about Cassidy.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.098
Is everyone decent?

20:23.307 --> 20:25.475
Hate for them
to see us naked.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.270
Yeah, they're good.
Come on in.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.647
Sorry for the
interruption, ladies.

20:30.856 --> 20:31.982
We're looking for Nick Costas

20:32.191 --> 20:33.775
in connection with
Cassidy's murder.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.153
We have information indicating
he was romantically-involved

20:36.361 --> 20:37.738
with someone
other than Cassidy.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.489
We were hoping one of you
might know who it is.

20:39.698 --> 20:40.991
You should ask Destiny.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.868
She's always sniffing around
Mr. Boss' guys.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.662
You'd wrap your legs around
anything with money, Sapphire.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.456
I saw you trying to get
with a parking meter.

20:47.664 --> 20:48.999
Trinity.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.959
You hooked up with
"The Stick" back in the day.

20:51.168 --> 20:54.046
A one-timer. I date
CEOs, not gangsters.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.505
The night Cassidy bit it,

20:55.714 --> 20:56.924
she came back from her break

20:57.132 --> 20:59.218
screaming about how
she just caught Nick

20:59.426 --> 21:01.762
banging some other chick,
and that she was gonna
send his ass to jail.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.388
Did anyone else
see Nick here that night?

21:03.597 --> 21:06.099
We all did.
He was completely wasted.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.810
He was practically
passed out on the rails
when I was on stage.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.190
Look, we know
where Nick is.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.608
We've got squad cars

21:14.816 --> 21:16.235
heading over
to pick him up as we speak.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.320
But if anyone knows
who the other woman is...

21:18.528 --> 21:21.198
I saw Helvetica grinding him
in the storage room once.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.241
You did not.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.533
Maybe I'm wrong,

21:23.742 --> 21:25.702
but, you do bring
a lot of guys in there.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.120
Did you just
call me a whore?

21:27.329 --> 21:29.081
What are you gonna
do about it?

21:29.289 --> 21:30.499
What am I gonna do about it?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.334
Why don't you say it again
to my face?

21:32.542 --> 21:34.670
I'm gonna rip
that bead out of your hair.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.338
Say it again, I dare you.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.591
The blonde
in the back?

21:39.800 --> 21:41.426
After I said the cops
were on the way
to pick up Nick,

21:41.635 --> 21:43.303
she started
texting on the sly.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.430
We should wait until
she gets off work.
Follow her.

21:45.639 --> 21:48.642
Should we sit at
the tip rail or do you
want to grab a table?

21:48.850 --> 21:50.352
I meant wait in the car.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.812
Uh, Xiaojie!

21:52.020 --> 21:52.938
Xiaojie!

21:54.356 --> 21:55.565
Xiaojie!

21:57.943 --> 21:59.486
Go sit on a screw!

22:04.157 --> 22:06.493
- The shoe shine guy.
- What about him?

22:06.702 --> 22:07.995
He witnessed the murder.

22:13.583 --> 22:14.918
He saw Cassidy get hit

22:15.127 --> 22:16.211
but he didn't see
who was inside the car.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.548
He feels bad for
not going to the police.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.258
He's in the country illegally.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.384
What kind of car was it?

22:26.930 --> 22:28.056
He said a blue hatchback.

22:30.225 --> 22:33.103
The manager's already
getting me a list of the
employees and customers,

22:33.312 --> 22:35.814
the ones who used
credit cards the night
Cassidy was murdered.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.232
I'll run the names at the DMV

22:37.441 --> 22:39.526
and see if anyone
has a blue hatchback.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.185
Dr. Chakrabarti.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.519
How's it hanging?

23:14.728 --> 23:17.147
Oh, it's hanging fine.
Thank you.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.316
Uh, I was just dropping off
a death certificate.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.486
Listen, um...

23:22.694 --> 23:23.779
I have a strange question.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.782
I'm a real dog person,

23:26.990 --> 23:28.700
and I was wondering
whatever happened
to that basset hound

23:28.909 --> 23:30.827
whose owner was taken
by the Chaos Killer.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.163
I guess they
found him on a bus.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.414
Did anyone adopt him?

23:34.623 --> 23:36.291
The victim's brother
took him in.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.378
Ah, happy ending. Excellent.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.923
Hey, before you go,
can you take a look
at something?

23:43.090 --> 23:44.049
Of course.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.429
Recognize that guy?

23:53.100 --> 23:54.101
No. Should I?

23:55.685 --> 23:57.270
I guess not.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.814
- Mmm.
- Thanks for your time.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.538
How do you not have
any food in your car?

24:14.746 --> 24:15.997
Because you already ate

24:16.206 --> 24:17.874
two granola bars
and my emergency almonds.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.127
Can't I just go
peek in the window?

24:20.335 --> 24:21.795
I mean, how do we know
Nick is even in there?

24:22.003 --> 24:23.338
Oh, he's in there.

24:23.547 --> 24:25.382
The car he murdered
Cassidy in is right there

24:25.590 --> 24:26.800
on the other side
of that bush.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.137
Holy crap.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.431
I think I just
willed myself a pizza.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.686
This way, pizza boy.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.438
Mama wants
some pepperoni.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.368
$15.75.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.829
Thirty minutes or less
my left nut.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.207
Nick Costas,

24:59.416 --> 25:01.501
you're under arrest for the
murder of Cassidy Kozlowski.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.295
You've got
the wrong guy, man.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.380
I was passed out drunk
when Cassidy got killed.

25:05.589 --> 25:08.216
I woke up in my own bed,
and my ankle tracker was gone.

25:08.425 --> 25:12.304
We have an eyewitness
who ID'd a blue hatchback
at the scene of the crime.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.347
What do you think the chances
are forensics discovers

25:14.556 --> 25:16.016
Cassidy's blood
on the side of that car?

25:16.850 --> 25:19.186
Uh, slim?

25:23.064 --> 25:24.232
Well, you're still
under arrest

25:24.441 --> 25:26.026
for violating probation

25:26.234 --> 25:27.819
by tampering with
the court-mandated
ankle monitor.

25:31.698 --> 25:35.952
I'm just so afraid...

25:36.161 --> 25:37.662
Of Nick?

25:37.871 --> 25:39.122
Are you afraid of Nick?

25:42.334 --> 25:44.252
Gran...

25:44.461 --> 25:46.379
Who's Gran?
Does he work for Mr. Boss?

25:47.756 --> 25:49.216
Finding out that...

25:51.092 --> 25:53.094
Finding out what, Lorelei?

25:53.303 --> 25:56.515
That, that, I'm...

25:56.723 --> 25:58.016
That I'm an...

25:58.225 --> 25:59.434
An accomplice?

25:59.643 --> 26:00.519
An accessory?

26:00.727 --> 26:01.686
Exotic...

26:03.063 --> 26:04.231
Are you frickin' kidding me?

26:04.439 --> 26:06.274
...dancer.

26:06.483 --> 26:07.901
Is this chick crying

26:08.109 --> 26:09.903
because her granny's
finding out she's a stripper?

26:10.111 --> 26:12.030
You're being questioned
in a murder case

26:12.239 --> 26:14.032
because you're a suspect.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.700
Oh, my God.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.912
It's like a frickin'
Adele concert in here.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.916
More information.
Less tears and snot.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.167
Lorelei, we need
to know what happened

26:24.376 --> 26:26.419
the night Cassidy was killed.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.421
Were you with Nick
when he left the club?

26:36.179 --> 26:38.723
That was like
interrogating a puddle.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.935
She'll calm down eventually
and want a deal.

26:45.188 --> 26:46.147
Babineaux.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.527
Are you sure about that?

26:52.320 --> 26:54.656
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.616
What was that?

26:56.825 --> 26:59.661
That list of names
I ran through the DMV...

26:59.869 --> 27:03.498
One of the Voulez Vous
patrons has a blue 1972
Chevelle Fastback

27:03.707 --> 27:04.749
registered under his name.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.795
And you'll never
guess who it is.

27:09.004 --> 27:12.424
Well, don't just tell me.
I want to stand here
waiting like a jackass.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.969
Our friend Johnny Frost.

27:16.177 --> 27:18.972
Okay, that did
deserve a buildup.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.311
Ravi! Guess who is back.

27:24.519 --> 27:25.812
What the hell
is happening here?

27:26.021 --> 27:27.564
Blaine is having some issue
with his memory.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.316
It's a little
more than an issue.

27:29.524 --> 27:30.692
He can't remember anything.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.819
Who he is.
Who we are.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.487
Does he remember
that he's a dick?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.406
I can smack him in the head
a couple hundred times.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.491
See if that shakes
something loose.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.659
Do you know me?

27:39.868 --> 27:41.536
Unfortunately, yeah.

27:41.745 --> 27:44.581
Oh, wait. What's
the last brain he ate?

27:44.789 --> 27:46.374
Last what? Brain?

27:47.334 --> 27:48.501
This guy, Dave.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.045
Did Dave have
Alzheimer's, dementia?

27:50.253 --> 27:51.296
No.

27:51.504 --> 27:52.922
The Dave he ate
crossed the finish line

27:53.131 --> 27:55.091
on a cross-country
bicycle ride for charity,

27:55.300 --> 27:57.177
and then got hit
by a drunk driver.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.929
It's unlikely his loss
of memory has been
caused by a brain.

28:00.138 --> 28:01.348
Blaine is human again.

28:01.556 --> 28:02.682
Again?

28:02.891 --> 28:03.850
He must've
taken the cure.

28:04.684 --> 28:05.935
The cure for what?

28:06.144 --> 28:07.687
The cure for being
an undead psychopath.

28:07.896 --> 28:09.022
Now you're
just a psychopath.

28:09.230 --> 28:10.398
You might have to change
your business cards.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.151
Wait, how was I not human?

28:13.360 --> 28:16.196
Look, I thought you were
taking me to a doctor.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.657
I need to see a real doctor.
This is a morgue.

28:19.699 --> 28:20.659
Liv...

28:22.494 --> 28:23.995
I'm not kidding.

28:24.204 --> 28:26.331
I'm about to help him to
a fistful of, "Cut the crap"

28:26.539 --> 28:27.624
if this doesn't stop.

28:27.832 --> 28:28.917
Look.

28:31.544 --> 28:32.754
I don't think he's faking.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.433
I've highlighted
all of the charges
that aren't mine.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.268
I mean, does this
sound like me?

28:47.477 --> 28:49.479
$100 for
eyelash extensions,

28:49.688 --> 28:52.607
640 at a store called
Pump Me, Pumps,

28:52.816 --> 28:55.110
six grand for a Vespa...

28:55.318 --> 28:56.403
Vespa, huh?

28:56.611 --> 28:58.697
$200 at Home Run Modeling.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.949
No. Wait, that might be mine.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.201
We're interested
in your blue Chevelle.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.577
It matches
the description of the car

29:04.786 --> 29:05.870
used in Cassidy's murder.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.914
I don't own a Chevelle, but,

29:08.123 --> 29:11.793
$11,000 of my hard-earned
credit line was spent on one.

29:12.001 --> 29:15.463
I have a photocopy of
the license the thief used
when he bought the car.

29:15.672 --> 29:18.049
I hired my ex-wife's PI
when all this went down.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.009
You hired your ex-wife's PI?

29:20.218 --> 29:21.344
The guy's a pro.

29:21.553 --> 29:22.971
Total lack of ethics.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.681
He broke into
my doctor's office

29:24.889 --> 29:26.307
and took pictures
of my medical records.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.643
That how the ex
proved I gave her...

29:28.852 --> 29:30.687
Ah! Ah, here it is.

29:30.895 --> 29:33.189
Hey! I know this guy!

29:33.398 --> 29:35.358
I'm pretty sure
he worked for Mr. Boss.

29:35.567 --> 29:36.484
You know his name?

29:36.693 --> 29:37.861
No.

29:38.069 --> 29:39.946
But I know
someone who will.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.364
Pablo Balaban.

29:41.573 --> 29:42.657
Nick's best friend.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.826
Literally,
his partner in crime.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.370
Anything else I should know
before I bring him in?

29:47.579 --> 29:49.038
You haven't granted
him immunity, have you?

29:49.247 --> 29:51.624
I understand why you're
mad, Clive, but I had...

29:51.791 --> 29:54.669
Still have the opportunity
to take down Mr. Boss.

29:54.878 --> 29:56.337
John Deaux had
a small-time drug bust.

29:56.546 --> 29:57.589
That's all I knew.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.549
No DA in America
doesn't make that deal.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.217
But we told you
who he was, and
you still let him go.

30:01.426 --> 30:03.762
The deal was signed.
Notarized.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.472
Make the Chaos Killer case.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.015
Make the Meat Cute case.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.641
I want to see him behind bars.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.854
I'm going to
go call the station.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.482
Get the ball rolling
on tracking down
Pablo Balaban.

30:20.195 --> 30:23.531
So, my people have been
working around the clock

30:23.740 --> 30:26.034
trying to track down
the house that has a
Thompson mailbox

30:26.242 --> 30:27.869
and a heavy duty
security screen door.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.496
I have some options
for you to check out.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.505
That's the one from my vision.
I'm sure of it.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.131
This... This is big, Liv.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.883
This is really big.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.885
I've got an address for Pablo.
We should get going.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.178
I can drop you
back at the station.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.702
<i>Exit the vehicle
with your hands in the air.</i>

31:22.799 --> 31:24.259
All right. Cuff them.

31:45.697 --> 31:46.739
Damn.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.286
Four numbers.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.329
Used in a six digit code.

31:54.956 --> 31:55.915
Fantastic.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.967
Okay.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.760
House number.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.512
Anniversary with Liv.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.016
Door number.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.186
College football number.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.606
Anniversary with Liv.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.608
Birth year.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.485
House number.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.529
College football number.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.991
Pee-wee football number.

32:30.199 --> 32:31.618
High school football number.

32:31.826 --> 32:33.703
Anniversary with Liv.

33:31.219 --> 33:32.971
"Fantalyne."

33:33.179 --> 33:34.305
Horse sedative?

33:44.857 --> 33:46.609
You got me
on identity theft.

33:46.818 --> 33:48.403
That's all.

33:48.611 --> 33:50.571
I got nothing to do with
what happened to Cassidy.

33:50.780 --> 33:51.948
It was a two-person job.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.742
Someone drove the car,
and someone hit Cassidy.

33:54.951 --> 33:57.161
An eyewitness puts your car
at the scene of the crime.

33:57.370 --> 34:00.915
I was in County General
waiting to get stitches
when Cassidy was killed.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.793
Bar fight.

34:04.002 --> 34:06.671
I know I signed in
and there was a bunch
of security cameras.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.006
It's not going to be hard
to check out.

34:08.881 --> 34:10.842
And where was your car?

34:11.050 --> 34:12.635
As far as I know,
it was in the garage.

34:18.182 --> 34:20.268
I'm not changing my story
because it's true.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.853
I don't remember anything.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.646
I got black-out drunk
and woke up the next day.

34:23.855 --> 34:27.442
Happy to take
a lie detector test
if you want.

34:27.650 --> 34:28.943
Your boyfriend's
alibi checks out,

34:29.152 --> 34:30.611
but you don't
seem to have one.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.947
In fact, your shift ended
shortly before the murder.

34:33.156 --> 34:34.782
Why the hell
do I need an alibi?

34:34.991 --> 34:36.075
Why would I kill the girl?

34:36.284 --> 34:37.660
Cassidy told
a room full of dancers

34:37.869 --> 34:38.786
that she wanted
to send Nick to jail.

34:38.995 --> 34:40.496
Now that's motive.

34:40.705 --> 34:43.082
I heard Nick's ankle monitor
puts him at the scene.

34:43.291 --> 34:44.459
Come on!

34:44.667 --> 34:46.836
I didn't have
any beef with Cassidy.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.921
Same can't be said
for Nick and Lorelei, can it?

34:49.130 --> 34:51.174
We've got you
for identity theft,

34:51.382 --> 34:53.760
taking the credit card info
from customers at Voulez Vous,

34:53.968 --> 34:55.970
providing them to Pablo.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.431
You're looking at 10 years.

34:58.639 --> 34:59.974
Are you sure you're
telling us everything?

35:02.727 --> 35:05.146
If I testified who I saw
getting into the car,

35:05.354 --> 35:06.731
what could you do for me?

35:06.939 --> 35:08.357
She said what?

35:08.566 --> 35:09.984
Destiny said she saw
you and Nick

35:10.193 --> 35:11.277
get inside
Pablo's blue hatchback

35:11.486 --> 35:13.154
minutes before
Cassidy was killed.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.823
You were worried about grandma
knowing you're a stripper.

35:16.032 --> 35:17.158
How's granny gonna feel

35:17.366 --> 35:18.993
when she finds out
you're a murderer?

35:19.202 --> 35:21.329
Cassidy tells everyone she was
gonna send Nick to prison.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.122
Nick's drunk,
so you're driving.

35:23.331 --> 35:25.083
He sees Cassidy
walking along the road.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.877
He decides he knows how to
make his problems go away.

35:31.672 --> 35:34.383
We don't believe you're
the murdering type, Lorelei.

35:34.592 --> 35:36.469
Just tell us what happened.
Nick did it, didn't he?

35:36.677 --> 35:38.513
How do you think you're
gonna do in prison, honey?

35:39.597 --> 35:41.265
Destiny is lying.

35:41.474 --> 35:43.518
She didn't see me get
into the car with Nick.

35:43.726 --> 35:45.228
He was passed out drunk.

35:45.436 --> 35:47.355
I couldn't take him home
on my Vespa.

35:47.563 --> 35:51.025
So Destiny helped me
get him into Pablo's car.

35:51.234 --> 35:54.821
<i>Destiny had me drive her home
because she was so pissed.</i>

35:55.029 --> 35:56.781
Cassidy is psychotic.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.157
It's not just Nick that's
going to go down
when she starts

35:58.366 --> 35:59.367
blabbing to the cops,
you know.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.618
It's Nick and Pablo.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.036
My man's gotta
pay with his life

36:02.245 --> 36:03.579
because Nick's sick of
screwing Cassidy?

36:04.831 --> 36:05.790
<i>And then, we saw her...</i>

36:05.998 --> 36:07.333
Go sit on a screw!

36:07.542 --> 36:09.001
There she is.
Pull up! Pull up!

36:09.210 --> 36:10.503
What are you going to do?

36:10.711 --> 36:12.296
Gonna scare her.
That's all.

36:13.881 --> 36:15.174
Gun it!

36:20.513 --> 36:22.932
I had no idea Destiny
was going to hit her.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.016
I swear.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.184
Why should we believe you?

36:26.894 --> 36:28.938
I know where
the tire iron is.

36:29.147 --> 36:31.816
That'll have her fingerprints
all over it, won't it?

36:32.024 --> 36:33.234
She threw it out
of the car window

36:33.442 --> 36:34.735
while we were driving
down the highway.

36:34.944 --> 36:37.655
It was by mileage marker 48,

36:37.864 --> 36:39.740
I figured I might need
to remember that.

36:39.949 --> 36:41.742
I'll request a search.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.003
Check it out, chief.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.923
<i>More than 1.9 million dollars</i>

36:56.132 --> 36:57.466
<i>of contraband was seized</i>

36:57.675 --> 36:59.177
<i>in the raid of a compound</i>

36:59.385 --> 37:02.346
<i>linked to reputed Seattle
crime lord, Stacey Boss.</i>

37:02.555 --> 37:05.433
<i>We continue to put a dent
in Mr. Boss's criminal empire.</i>

37:05.641 --> 37:06.559
<i>For anyone in
the Utopia trade...</i>

37:07.935 --> 37:10.104
It's a sign, man.

37:10.313 --> 37:12.773
It's not like our fearless
leader is up to the task.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.737
We'll never get
a chance like this again.

37:22.575 --> 37:23.701
I want this, buddy.

37:35.338 --> 37:37.423
Let those bitches
try and kill me now.

37:45.973 --> 37:47.391
Welcome back, Destiny.

37:52.563 --> 37:53.522
You wanna guess
whose fingerprints

37:53.731 --> 37:55.650
we found on that tire iron?

37:59.153 --> 38:00.947
She was gonna
send my man to jail.

38:01.155 --> 38:02.531
Does Pablo know what you did?

38:04.659 --> 38:08.246
<i>There's loyalty
and there's being an idiot.</i>

38:08.454 --> 38:10.248
<i>Sometimes it looks the same.</i>

38:10.456 --> 38:13.000
<i>If you love someone
despite what they do,</i>

38:13.209 --> 38:16.254
<i>you're lying to yourself.</i>

38:16.462 --> 38:19.507
<i>You can't love someone
you don't really know.</i>

38:19.715 --> 38:22.051
<i>But it can sure
as hell feel like you do.</i>

38:22.260 --> 38:23.386
I really need
to talk to Drake.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.139
He's dead, honey.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.351
I know he's dead.

38:30.559 --> 38:31.769
What?

38:31.978 --> 38:35.022
Mr. Boss killed him.
I know it!

38:35.231 --> 38:37.817
I talk to my son
two or three times a day,

38:38.025 --> 38:41.529
and I haven't heard
from him in four days.

38:41.737 --> 38:44.073
Oh, please... Please
come in, won't you?

38:44.282 --> 38:45.574
I'd love the company.

38:48.911 --> 38:51.497
I was just looking
through some pictures.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.669
Oh, my beautiful boy.

38:59.046 --> 39:02.967
Oh, here he is at his
first karate tournament.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.303
Kicked everybody else's butt.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.429
Well...

39:08.556 --> 39:12.226
And here he is at his
Junior Spring Formal.

39:12.435 --> 39:14.186
Look at his hair.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.563
Yeah.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.193
What's that from?

39:23.070 --> 39:25.865
That's Drake,
the day he graduated

39:26.073 --> 39:28.659
from the police academy.

39:28.868 --> 39:32.747
I told him I didn't want him
working undercover.

39:32.955 --> 39:35.291
It's too dangerous, I said.

39:38.169 --> 39:39.378
I should warn you.

39:39.587 --> 39:41.797
I haven't been able
to eat all day

39:42.006 --> 39:43.799
and I'm just crossing over

39:44.008 --> 39:46.552
from low blood sugar
to downright crabby.

39:51.474 --> 39:53.768
Ravi...

39:53.976 --> 39:57.730
It took me a remarkably
long time to understand
what this was.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.191
You have to let me...
"Tim Addis.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.776
"Monday. Wednesday. Friday."

40:01.984 --> 40:02.985
I can explain...

40:03.194 --> 40:04.570
"Drives kids to school.
7:30 to 8:00.

40:04.779 --> 40:06.113
"Evelyn Morris, housekeeper.

40:06.322 --> 40:07.782
"Leaves at 4:30.
No alarm."

40:07.990 --> 40:10.451
- Ravi, please...
- You knew

40:10.659 --> 40:12.745
Colin Andrews went
for a run with his dog

40:12.953 --> 40:14.914
in Seward Park every evening.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.415
Of course, we know
where that dog ended up.

40:16.624 --> 40:17.666
Why did you do this?

40:17.875 --> 40:18.793
Because I have
the right to know

40:19.001 --> 40:20.419
if I'm living with a murderer!

40:20.628 --> 40:21.962
I should know if my
friend is killing people!

40:22.171 --> 40:23.130
I'm not killing people!

40:23.339 --> 40:24.298
What?
They're not people?

40:24.507 --> 40:25.424
They're zombies?

40:25.633 --> 40:26.967
So, what's Liv to you?

40:27.176 --> 40:28.427
Ravi, you don't understand!

40:28.636 --> 40:29.678
You stalk them, Major.

40:29.887 --> 40:31.806
You hunt them
and you drug them,

40:32.014 --> 40:33.474
and I am terrified
to find out what you...

40:33.682 --> 40:34.517
Stop!
