08:35.182 --> 08:37.309
Apparently not.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.482
- That's dope.
- [laughs softly]

08:43.482 --> 08:45.108
How'd you learn to make these?

08:45.108 --> 08:48.195
So I actually spent
a summer in this desert town

08:48.195 --> 08:51.531
in Texas near the border
called Marfa.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.283
And there was a bar there
that served these,

08:53.283 --> 08:55.118
and I told the bartender
that I would not leave

08:55.118 --> 08:57.663
until he showed me
exactly how he made these.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.082
[chuckles]

09:00.082 --> 09:02.000
Can I try a sip?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.253
Are your parents cool with that?

09:04.253 --> 09:06.964
- Yeah, yeah, no,
they don't care.
- Oh, then, sure.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.675
I'm gonna take this out
to your dad.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.593
Do you mind taking those out
to Susannah and your mom?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.679
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, love.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.771
Oh, well, how is it?
Strong? [chuckles]

09:22.771 --> 09:25.232
- [laughs] That is amazing.
Yeah.
- Is it?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.488
Mmm. No wonder you like it.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.700
- It tastes just like a Slurpee.
- Yeah, exactly.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.910
- But I have an idea.
- Oh, no.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.954
Sous-chef, I'm gonna need
some more pomegranate juice.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.372
[Jeremiah] You got it.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.751
What are you guys making?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.337
Pomegranate margaritas,
but with a twist.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.047
Well, you got to use
the good blender.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.134
Oh, I-I haven't used that thing

09:52.134 --> 09:54.594
since the great
Kool-Aid debacle of 2011.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.556
[laughs] I remember,
the counters were sticky for...

09:57.556 --> 10:00.350
- two summers?
- [laughs] Yeah. Just about.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.145
Dad kept his, uh,
briefcase in my room for a year.

10:03.145 --> 10:07.024
"As a reminder that all mistakes
are not reversible."

10:07.024 --> 10:10.902
Wait, won't he be mad
if he finds out?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.155
Well, he's not gonna find out.
He's not coming.

you're mixing up there.

- Ooh.
- Yeah, sure.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.744
- Hey, thanks, Belly.
- Oh, you're gonna love

11:00.744 --> 11:02.579
the firework show this year.
It's gonna be the best one yet.

at Sloan Kettering

11:42.953 --> 11:45.288
said they're starting an
experimental trial soon after...

11:45.288 --> 11:47.499
What are you doing here, Adam?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.127
Laurel called me this morning,

11:50.127 --> 11:51.628
said, "Get your ass here,"
so I'm here.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.588
She shouldn't have done that.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.425
You didn't know.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.927
No, I didn't.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.554
Well, I thought
you'd changed your mind.

Well, since it's done, we, um,
we just need to get through it.

Susannah had some kind of fight.
