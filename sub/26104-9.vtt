WEBVTT

00:04.480 --> 00:06.116
- Previously on
"Mayans M.C."...

00:06.149 --> 00:07.950
- We picked up Galindo
because of your intel.

00:07.983 --> 00:11.221
- After you promised me that
my men wouldn't be compromised.

00:11.254 --> 00:12.588
But I get plenty more intel,

00:12.622 --> 00:14.224
so maybe you can wait
a few days,

00:14.257 --> 00:15.725
read about it on
WikiLeaks.

00:15.758 --> 00:17.560
- This is very unsettling.

00:18.928 --> 00:20.863
- The ramblings
of a beautiful mind.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.581
- They own us, Miguel.

00:38.614 --> 00:40.416
They can touch
everything we have,

00:40.450 --> 00:42.118
everyone we know.

00:42.152 --> 00:43.453
- Not everyone.

00:43.486 --> 00:45.555
I've got
2,000 forgotten soldiers

00:45.588 --> 00:47.423
just waiting for
a devil to lead them.

00:47.457 --> 00:49.925
- My father was betrayed
by a friend.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.827
A sacred trust.

00:51.861 --> 00:53.563
They chopped off his head.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.798
- There's something you might
want to see.

00:55.831 --> 00:57.433
Do you know the Bishop?

01:02.638 --> 01:04.507
- Sí.

01:09.445 --> 01:13.249
Holy shit.

01:13.283 --> 01:14.584
Faces on the ground!

01:14.617 --> 01:17.687
Hands behind your head
right now.

01:35.705 --> 01:42.678
*

01:44.980 --> 01:47.183
- How about the dead
fucking body in your trunk?

01:47.217 --> 01:48.884
Who is it?

01:48.918 --> 01:50.520
- Don't know.

01:50.553 --> 01:53.022
We didn't put it there.

01:53.055 --> 01:55.124
Someone planted an old, fat
chick in your car?

01:55.157 --> 01:56.526
- Maybe it was your
overambitious

01:56.559 --> 01:58.594
and under-informed partner.

02:01.864 --> 02:04.133
- Jesus, man.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.836
I don't know how we look
the other way on this one.

02:06.869 --> 02:08.604
- Hey, Rogan.

02:09.772 --> 02:11.441
Come here.

02:19.249 --> 02:21.651
- Bishop will talk to Peña.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.686
We'll figure this out.

02:34.864 --> 02:36.165
- Apparently the Reyes boys

02:36.198 --> 02:39.602
stumbled into
a Homeland Security issue.

02:39.635 --> 02:41.637
That body in the trunk
isn't theirs.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.076
I mean, we haven't even ID'd
the body yet.

02:47.109 --> 02:48.978
Who's this?

02:50.212 --> 02:51.614
- We'll sort it out from here.

02:51.647 --> 02:53.283
Apologize for
the inconvenience.

02:53.316 --> 02:55.150
I'll walk you through it.
- Come on.

03:25.348 --> 03:27.350
- Ah, good evening, gentlemen.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.322
Lovely night for a walk.

03:36.859 --> 03:39.429
- You were outside
the scrapyard.

03:39.462 --> 03:43.032
- Aw, there's that
beautiful mind at work.

03:49.004 --> 03:52.141
- The Santo Padre police are

03:52.174 --> 03:56.379
busy processing
your release papers.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.652
My name is Lincoln Potter.

04:02.685 --> 04:05.421
I am an assistant U.S.
attorney.

04:05.455 --> 04:08.424
We--we heard about
your situation

04:08.458 --> 04:10.660
over the police spat.

04:10.693 --> 04:13.929
- Yes.

04:13.963 --> 04:18.368
If this goes well,
our conversation.

04:18.401 --> 04:20.169
Our bond.

04:22.572 --> 04:25.040
- We want a lawyer.

04:25.074 --> 04:27.410
- Hmm.
- Don't say anything.

04:32.515 --> 04:34.684
- There was a dead body
in the trunk of the car

04:34.717 --> 04:36.519
you were driving.

04:36.552 --> 04:40.456
That car belongs to another
member of your M.C.

04:40.490 --> 04:45.361
I'm sure there's Mayan DNA
everywhere.

04:45.395 --> 04:47.530
Should I go on?

04:54.003 --> 04:56.506
Your brother, Ezekiel,

04:56.539 --> 05:00.376
made a deal with the DEA
while incarcerated.

05:00.410 --> 05:05.681
It was put on the table by
an agent Kevin Jimenez.

05:05.715 --> 05:08.350
Your second cousin, yes?

05:11.954 --> 05:15.224
- EZ feeds Jiminez information
on the Galindo Cartel

05:15.257 --> 05:18.260
about their heroin empire...

05:18.293 --> 05:20.362
but as you know,

05:20.396 --> 05:24.033
life on the border,
so unpredictable.

05:24.066 --> 05:27.102
Miguel Galindo is no longer
our focus.

05:27.136 --> 05:30.773
The escalating dissent
in Mexico

05:30.806 --> 05:34.209
has shifted all priorities.

05:34.243 --> 05:37.547
Which means...

05:37.580 --> 05:40.550
your deal is irrelevant.

05:40.583 --> 05:43.085
And because you haven't
accrued enough points,

05:43.118 --> 05:44.720
they'll put you back inside,

05:44.754 --> 05:46.756
and I'm afraid there's
a real possibility

05:46.789 --> 05:48.558
your involvement with
the authorities

05:48.591 --> 05:51.193
could be exposed and,
of course,

05:51.226 --> 05:56.599
with that comes an agonizing,
shiv-related end.

06:03.506 --> 06:05.941
- But if that was gonna happen,

06:05.975 --> 06:09.612
you wouldn't be inside
our cell.

06:09.645 --> 06:13.048
- That is correct, Angel.

06:13.082 --> 06:16.318
I come here with
an opportunity.

06:16.351 --> 06:17.887
One that's good for
your brother

06:17.920 --> 06:20.289
and therefore you as well.

06:20.322 --> 06:23.425
An ideology has manifested

06:23.459 --> 06:27.062
that threatens tranquility
on both sides of the border.

06:27.096 --> 06:29.965
Because of your...

06:29.999 --> 06:33.102
unique, street level
skill sets,

06:33.135 --> 06:34.470
we feel it's something

06:34.504 --> 06:37.339
you could handle
far better than we could.

06:42.612 --> 06:45.548
- That means you do
the patriotic thing.

06:48.551 --> 06:49.952
I wouldn't ask you

06:49.985 --> 06:52.454
to do anything
that you haven't done before.

06:52.488 --> 06:54.490
You do this for us...

06:54.524 --> 06:56.125
you help with this

06:56.158 --> 06:58.961
and you won't need to
accrue points, Ezekiel,

06:58.994 --> 07:02.598
because the deal will
never have existed.

07:02.632 --> 07:04.466
I will wipe it clean!

07:04.500 --> 07:07.803
You will be free and clear.

07:14.744 --> 07:18.013
I'll be in touch
with the details.

07:23.886 --> 07:25.988
You're free to go.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.394
- Yes.

07:32.427 --> 07:35.197
We'll hold on to the dead body
in case you change your mind,

07:35.230 --> 07:39.368
and then you'll both be
in jail.

07:39.401 --> 07:43.172
When EZ's exposed,
the M.C. will assume

07:43.205 --> 07:45.307
the brother,
the blood that brought him in,

07:45.340 --> 07:48.010
will have known about it,

07:48.043 --> 07:50.680
and we'll be right back
to where we were,

07:50.713 --> 07:54.717
that agonizing death
for both of you.

07:56.251 --> 07:59.421
Poor Felipe.

07:59.454 --> 08:00.556
No wife.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.026
No sons.

08:04.059 --> 08:05.595
- You're fucking evil.

08:07.462 --> 08:09.865
That's a little
Eye of Sauron-ish,

08:09.899 --> 08:11.967
don't you think?

08:14.203 --> 08:17.006
Telling both of you made sense.

08:17.039 --> 08:21.510
That way I get two problem
solvers for the price of one.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.980
As long as brother
doesn't kill you.

08:27.817 --> 08:31.887
Oh, this is probably
worth mentioning.

08:31.921 --> 08:33.555
EZ wouldn't make the deal

08:33.589 --> 08:36.792
unless there was
a familial protection clause.

08:38.327 --> 08:39.962
Nothing he gave the DEA

08:39.995 --> 08:44.033
could ever be used against
you or the M.C.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.401
So, you know, there's that.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.840
A little bro-on-bro love.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.576
We'll speak soon, gentlemen.

09:06.588 --> 09:13.528
*

09:38.353 --> 09:40.990
- Please, you got
to let me explain.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.819
- Get out.

10:39.882 --> 10:41.583
- Get up.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.679
- Get up!

11:12.547 --> 11:14.383
- Get up!

11:19.822 --> 11:22.624
- "I just want to be home,
Angel.

11:22.657 --> 11:25.260
"Be with you and Pop.

11:25.294 --> 11:28.263
"Be part of something.

11:28.297 --> 11:30.966
Maybe there's a spot for me
in the club."

11:33.936 --> 11:36.138
You lied to me!

11:36.171 --> 11:38.173
You fucking played me.

11:41.343 --> 11:43.145
That asshole was right.

11:43.178 --> 11:44.947
The club will think
I was a part of it.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.416
They won't think I would be
that fucking estupido

11:47.449 --> 11:52.054
that I would let my own baby
brother fucking betray me.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.089
Not like this!

11:57.292 --> 11:58.994
What does Pop know?

12:05.267 --> 12:08.170
Of course he knows.

12:08.203 --> 12:09.438
- He had no choice,
this was--

12:09.471 --> 12:11.473
- Shut the fuck up!

13:09.198 --> 13:11.901
- La sangre es la sangre.

13:25.714 --> 13:32.687
*

13:33.288 --> 13:35.991
- * Mother of exiles

13:36.025 --> 13:38.160
* The torch of hope

13:38.193 --> 13:41.063
* In the toss of the tempest

13:41.096 --> 13:43.933
* Threw us medicine's rope

13:43.966 --> 13:47.169
* But the brazen giant

13:47.202 --> 13:49.571
* With limbs astride

13:49.604 --> 13:52.541
* Blocks the golden door

13:52.574 --> 13:55.344
* To the U.S. of lies

13:55.377 --> 13:56.778
* Screaming

13:56.811 --> 14:00.950
* Damn your huddled masses

14:00.983 --> 14:03.585
* Scrub our floors

14:03.618 --> 14:06.188
* Cut our grasses

14:06.221 --> 14:08.757
* I am a wolf

14:08.790 --> 14:11.626
* A wild cur

14:11.660 --> 14:15.064
* Cut from the pack

14:15.097 --> 14:17.466
* With blood on my fur

14:17.499 --> 14:20.235
* Every howl

14:20.269 --> 14:22.904
* Marks the dead

14:22.938 --> 14:26.475
* 'Cause a beaten dog

14:26.508 --> 14:28.110
*

14:28.143 --> 14:30.212
* Never forgets

14:30.245 --> 14:33.382
*

14:33.415 --> 14:35.584
* Never forgets

14:35.617 --> 14:42.324
*

15:21.396 --> 15:24.133
- I'm looking for Angel.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.268
- It's my brother.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.902
- I'm EZ.

15:34.076 --> 15:35.677
- This is Coco.

15:37.412 --> 15:39.348
- Sorry about your mom.

15:51.193 --> 15:53.828
- That guy's wound
a little tight.

15:53.862 --> 15:56.298
- Yeah.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.167
He just got back from Iraq,

15:58.200 --> 15:59.701
but he's cool though.

15:59.734 --> 16:01.870
He knows a lot about guns.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.375
Helped me get this.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.088
You sure about this,
little brother?

16:20.555 --> 16:22.424
- Yeah.

16:22.457 --> 16:24.293
It's just for protection.

16:32.934 --> 16:35.704
You gotta let this shit go,
man.

16:35.737 --> 16:37.406
You keep going deeper down
this hole--

16:37.439 --> 16:38.940
- I know. I can't help it.

16:41.643 --> 16:44.113
- It was a junkie who killed
Mom looking for cash.

16:44.146 --> 16:45.947
That's what the cops said--
- There was no money taken.

16:45.980 --> 16:47.449
- I know!

16:47.482 --> 16:49.951
It doesn't make sense.

16:49.984 --> 16:52.221
That's the whole fucking point,
Ezekiel.

16:52.254 --> 16:54.389
It's fucked up.

16:54.423 --> 16:55.890
You--you can't figure it out.

16:55.924 --> 16:58.627
It's not a fucking
math problem.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.903
Whoever it was,
they're long gone.

17:14.643 --> 17:17.812
- The Wildcat sticker was from
El Centro High School.

17:17.846 --> 17:21.116
The car belongs to a local.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

17:28.323 --> 17:30.325
Don't make me sorry
I got you that.

18:33.888 --> 18:36.024
He was good, wasn't he?

18:37.492 --> 18:39.994
If he didn't get
an academic ride,

18:40.028 --> 18:42.697
that slider would have gotten
him into any school.

18:47.569 --> 18:51.740
- Not much of me on these
shelves is there, Pop?

18:51.773 --> 18:55.076
It's not your fault.

18:55.109 --> 18:57.279
'Cause I haven't done much
for you to be proud of.

19:17.131 --> 19:20.101
- When I was a kid...

19:20.134 --> 19:24.673
I used to have this fear...

19:24.706 --> 19:27.676
that someone would break
into the house,

19:27.709 --> 19:30.745
put a gun up to your head,

19:30.779 --> 19:32.781
and to Mom's head...

19:36.217 --> 19:39.220
Make me choose...

19:39.254 --> 19:41.189
which one lives,

19:41.222 --> 19:45.427
which one gets their brains
blown out.

19:45.460 --> 19:48.062
Fucked up...

19:48.096 --> 19:49.964
isn't it?

20:06.515 --> 20:07.849
- Angel.

20:09.784 --> 20:13.988
- I found out about his DEA
deal tonight.

20:14.022 --> 20:16.325
You chose him over me.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.194
You always have.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.906
- EZ wouldn't make the deal

20:31.940 --> 20:35.410
unless he talked to me first.

20:35.444 --> 20:38.480
He was up for parole in six.

20:40.615 --> 20:43.051
I thought if he had a chance...

20:46.321 --> 20:51.025
They don't set
cop killers free.

20:52.861 --> 20:56.698
Not until they forget
what it is to be out.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.803
Then it's too late.

21:01.836 --> 21:04.406
I didn't choose him over you.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.276
I knew you'd take care of him.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.713
You'd watch his back in
the M.C.

21:11.746 --> 21:13.214
I figured

21:13.247 --> 21:17.352
he'd get his points
helping DEA get Galindo.

21:17.386 --> 21:19.554
Then he could walk away.

21:21.756 --> 21:25.894
Have the chance to live the
life he was supposed to have.

21:30.732 --> 21:32.934
Do I have the life I'm supposed
to have?

21:36.738 --> 21:39.073
- You chose it.

21:39.107 --> 21:42.210
I didn't like it.

21:42.243 --> 21:44.045
I never judged you.

21:47.015 --> 21:50.251
I never stopped loving you.

21:50.284 --> 21:52.353
You were my firstborn.

21:58.627 --> 22:00.862
- Guess I'm having trouble
seeing that.

22:18.980 --> 22:21.883
- This U.S. attorney.

22:21.916 --> 22:25.454
Bottom fell out of
the Galindo deal...

22:25.487 --> 22:29.223
wants us to help him out
with a problem.

22:29.257 --> 22:33.261
If we do it,
your golden boy...

22:33.294 --> 22:36.030
is free and clear.

22:42.437 --> 22:46.074
If it's good for EZ,
we got to do it...

22:46.107 --> 22:47.942
right?

22:54.949 --> 22:58.553
- I'm sorry this came crashing
down on you.

22:58.587 --> 23:01.089
I made a mistake.

23:01.122 --> 23:03.091
I didn't see any of it coming.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.764
Shit on the border, violence...

23:09.798 --> 23:11.299
dissent.

23:15.003 --> 23:17.839
"Dissent."

23:20.942 --> 23:23.612
- Opposing points of view.

23:23.645 --> 23:25.313
Rebellion.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.987
- Rebellion...

23:33.021 --> 23:35.857
escalating dissent...

23:35.890 --> 23:37.926
shit.

23:37.959 --> 23:41.963
They're going after the rebels.

23:41.996 --> 23:43.865
- Angel!

23:43.898 --> 23:46.000
Shit.

23:51.039 --> 23:54.042
[woman speaking Spanish
indistinctly]

25:07.649 --> 25:09.584
- It's chaos.

25:09.618 --> 25:11.620
- I know.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.061
Please.
- Thank you.

25:26.434 --> 25:29.470
- This U.S. attorney,

25:29.503 --> 25:31.706
the DOJ--
well, you know the process,

25:31.740 --> 25:33.141
but to help with the rebels,

25:33.174 --> 25:34.976
they'll need access
to our operation,

25:35.009 --> 25:37.746
and once they're inside,
we're done.

25:37.779 --> 25:40.749
They'll know how to cut off
our revenue sources,

25:40.782 --> 25:42.416
supplies...

25:42.450 --> 25:44.485
they can sabotage
relationships,

25:44.518 --> 25:46.087
expose us as cooperators.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.223
We'll be forced to bend
to any demand they make.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.727
- But so much of our revenue
is legitimate now.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.929
- And I'm not gonna sacrifice
all that hard work.

25:54.963 --> 25:57.766
Look, I want to create a...

25:57.799 --> 25:59.467
shadow structure.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.170
Kind of a layer
on top of our business--

26:02.203 --> 26:06.675
some of it real,
most of it smoke and paper.

26:06.708 --> 26:08.442
- We'll give them access
to just enough

26:08.476 --> 26:11.946
so they feel like
they're in control.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.481
- I...

26:13.514 --> 26:15.516
I don't understand.

26:15.549 --> 26:18.319
- I'm going to work
with Los Olvidados.

26:21.022 --> 26:23.658
- Miguel.

26:23.692 --> 26:27.128
You cannot double-cross
the U.S. government.

26:27.161 --> 26:29.597
We're not Escobar.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.766
We don't own a country.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.369
- Adelita has left no room
for me to jump.

26:35.403 --> 26:37.105
Her deal makes the most sense.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.941
- If our friend at diocese
comes through

26:39.974 --> 26:41.843
we can end her reign.

26:41.876 --> 26:43.344
- I don't see her making
that mistake.

26:43.377 --> 26:45.379
- And the movement will
continue without her

26:45.413 --> 26:47.982
fueled by a martyr.

26:48.016 --> 26:51.853
- This U.S. attorney,
he will see all this.

26:51.886 --> 26:53.822
- No, he won't,

26:53.855 --> 26:56.157
but those arrogant fucks think
they know everything.

26:56.190 --> 26:58.026
With the rebels

26:58.059 --> 27:01.129
I'll have access to resources
they don't even know exist,

27:01.162 --> 27:03.564
and while they're moving around
bogus chess pieces,

27:03.597 --> 27:06.567
we'll be playing the game
on a whole different board.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.237
- Everything we do will be off
the grid.

27:13.407 --> 27:15.409
- That's our play.

27:17.578 --> 27:20.849
That's how we stay
one step ahead.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.686
- No.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.722
That's how destroy ourselves.

27:29.557 --> 27:32.226
You hate the feds.
So do I.

27:32.260 --> 27:34.662
They fucked over this family,

27:34.695 --> 27:38.232
but now you're making a
decision clouded by that hate.

27:38.266 --> 27:41.269
It's--it's a mistake, Miguel.

27:43.537 --> 27:46.207
I know how they operate.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.577
I learned a hard lesson
with your father...

27:50.979 --> 27:53.882
But I can protect you.

27:57.118 --> 28:00.421
I know how unsettling
all this is,

28:00.454 --> 28:03.291
but please, son,

28:03.324 --> 28:06.494
give yourself time
to think clearly.

28:08.963 --> 28:13.768
Your legacy,
your family...

28:13.802 --> 28:15.904
there's so much at stake.

28:21.309 --> 28:24.612
- Thank you, Devante.

28:27.448 --> 28:29.450
- Yes.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.522
Of course.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.935
- Maybe he's right.

28:48.436 --> 28:50.038
Jesus.

28:54.175 --> 28:56.310
How do I even think straight in
all of this?

29:01.649 --> 29:03.651
What do I do?

29:06.720 --> 29:10.491
- My advice,
Devante's...

29:10.524 --> 29:13.327
it might help...

29:13.361 --> 29:16.831
but you have to trust
your instincts, Miguel.

29:16.865 --> 29:19.133
The rest...

29:19.167 --> 29:23.204
is just opinions and noise.

29:23.237 --> 29:26.340
You'll know what's right.

29:26.374 --> 29:28.376
You always do.

29:33.481 --> 29:36.350
I'll finish sorting this out.

29:36.384 --> 29:38.486
You know, those assholes
just dumped

29:38.519 --> 29:41.622
payroll ledgers all over
your dad's family stuff.

29:41.655 --> 29:42.991
Hi.

29:43.024 --> 29:44.558
Ripped all those pictures.

29:44.592 --> 29:47.028
Almost crushed your brother's
medical records.

31:03.137 --> 31:05.206
- Yeah.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.141
Angel come by the house?

31:07.175 --> 31:09.177
- Yeah.

31:15.683 --> 31:17.685
I'm sorry.

31:22.957 --> 31:25.926
- You did everything
that they wanted you to do.

31:32.133 --> 31:34.135
Angel was right.

31:35.669 --> 31:39.007
Your future was more important
to me than anything else.

31:40.174 --> 31:41.976
I should have known better,

31:42.010 --> 31:44.145
letting you get into bed with
the DEA.

31:44.178 --> 31:46.314
They're vultures.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.188
- I made the decision.

31:54.222 --> 31:56.924
You had no choice.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.959
I put my family at risk.

32:01.629 --> 32:04.365
- Angel's hurt.

32:04.398 --> 32:06.200
Feels betrayed,

32:06.234 --> 32:09.537
but I know him.
I know who he is.

32:16.244 --> 32:19.247
- Doesn't matter anymore.

32:24.518 --> 32:28.656
Inside, when there's nothing
else to see,

32:28.689 --> 32:32.060
it's easy to create an idea

32:32.093 --> 32:36.997
and an image...

32:37.031 --> 32:39.667
of what you think you want.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.970
But...

32:43.003 --> 32:44.738
the closer I get
to those things,

32:44.772 --> 32:46.774
the more strange they look.

32:50.878 --> 32:53.514
I'm so tired of chasing
my life, Pop.

33:07.428 --> 33:10.098
- I'm gonna replace the gasket
on the Road King.

33:18.206 --> 33:20.208
It's all I got.

33:37.491 --> 33:44.465
*

33:56.510 --> 33:58.045
- And just thank him for
his cooperation.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.748
Tell him we'll be in touch.

34:00.781 --> 34:02.750
Yes. Good.

34:02.783 --> 34:05.819
Thank you, hermano.

34:05.853 --> 34:07.555
Nestor.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.790
Our friend at the diocese
has come through.

34:09.823 --> 34:11.492
She's minutes away.

34:11.525 --> 34:12.993
- That is good news.

34:13.026 --> 34:14.162
- Yes.

34:14.195 --> 34:16.464
I took your advice.
I...

34:16.497 --> 34:20.468
cleared my head,
saw the big picture.

34:20.501 --> 34:22.303
Thank you.

34:25.473 --> 34:27.441
We have some work to do.

34:27.475 --> 34:31.679
Need to figure out how
to position all this.

34:31.712 --> 34:35.916
- We reassure Alvarez
it'll be business as usual,

34:35.949 --> 34:39.353
that what happened the other
night was just harassment.

34:39.387 --> 34:43.357
Feds had nothing,
so they could do nothing.

34:43.391 --> 34:45.726
And that message goes out
to all our buyers.

34:53.401 --> 34:55.969
You made the right choice, son.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.209
- Yes.

35:02.510 --> 35:04.144
I know.

35:15.356 --> 35:18.158
- Pick up, Adelita.

35:18.192 --> 35:19.727
Pick up.

35:39.179 --> 35:46.119
*

35:56.196 --> 35:59.367
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.402
I'm sorry.

38:08.729 --> 38:15.669
*

38:45.533 --> 38:48.268
- Adelita.
You hear from her?

38:50.070 --> 38:52.139
- Shit.

39:03.651 --> 39:07.788
- Yeah,
but I think we got a problem

39:07.821 --> 39:09.823
I got to the rebel camp
and it was gone.

39:11.659 --> 39:16.263
Been calling the sat phone.
No one's picking up.

39:16.296 --> 39:17.631
This is bad.

39:17.665 --> 39:19.132
- You think
it got something to do

39:19.166 --> 39:21.134
with the feds moving on
Galindo?

39:23.103 --> 39:25.539
- Devante called.
Meeting with Galindo's a go.

39:25.573 --> 39:27.475
San Buho Casino.

39:27.508 --> 39:29.510
- Now.

39:37.350 --> 39:39.887
- You know what's happening
with the Reyes deal yet?

39:39.920 --> 39:43.457
- Haven't heard from Potter,
which is kind of how I like it.

39:43.491 --> 39:44.992
- I just tried accessing
the case file.

39:45.025 --> 39:46.660
I couldn't get in.

39:58.772 --> 40:01.742
It's probably IT doing
maintenance.

40:01.775 --> 40:04.177
- Yeah, okay.
Thanks.

40:14.387 --> 40:21.361
*

40:24.031 --> 40:27.601
- * When the world,
it tries to break you *

40:27.635 --> 40:30.470
*

40:30.504 --> 40:33.541
* I hope you reach
for higher things *

40:33.574 --> 40:36.009
*

40:36.043 --> 40:40.280
* Guessing when the summer
takes you *

40:40.313 --> 40:42.382
*

40:42.415 --> 40:46.453
* I hope you see
what that'll bring *

40:46.486 --> 40:53.426
*

40:58.065 --> 41:01.068
[indistinct chatter,
phones ringing]

41:10.844 --> 41:12.846
- Jesus.

41:17.618 --> 41:20.754
Hey, man.
- KJ.

41:21.722 --> 41:24.024
You doing all right?

41:24.057 --> 41:25.893
- Hanging in.

41:27.394 --> 41:29.396
- Shit.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.568
- Guess I don't need this.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.372
I fucked this up pretty bad.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.377
I didn't mean for it
to blow back on you.

41:47.147 --> 41:49.416
- It's all right, man.

41:49.449 --> 41:51.451
I get it.

41:53.921 --> 41:56.023
- Larry.

42:00.794 --> 42:02.863
- I'm sorry.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.132
I embarrassed you,
the DEA.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.637
- Yeah.

42:09.670 --> 42:12.472
It's all handled.

42:12.505 --> 42:14.441
Gonna head up north.

42:14.474 --> 42:16.910
Meet up with my wife and kids
at her mom's.

42:18.912 --> 42:20.480
Any questions come up

42:20.513 --> 42:24.151
as you're going through
my report, just, uh...

42:24.184 --> 42:27.087
gimme a call.
- Yeah, we should be okay.

42:28.155 --> 42:30.658
Hey.

42:30.691 --> 42:35.495
You take care of yourself, KJ.

42:35.528 --> 42:37.865
- Yeah.

42:50.177 --> 42:52.813
- What the hell were we
looking for?

42:57.985 --> 42:59.953
- A whistleblower.

43:02.990 --> 43:06.026
*

43:09.062 --> 43:16.036
*

43:32.519 --> 43:39.492
*

43:45.398 --> 43:47.835
- Tribal council.

43:47.868 --> 43:50.637
- That's Navajo for hungover.

43:50.670 --> 43:52.572
Mr. Galindo and his party are
already here.

43:52.605 --> 43:54.041
We put you in the same room.

43:54.074 --> 43:55.876
- That's good.

43:55.909 --> 43:57.878
- No.

43:57.911 --> 43:59.312
Think we're good.

43:59.346 --> 44:01.581
When you clean up,
we'll handle.

44:01.614 --> 44:03.016
- Fair enough.

44:03.050 --> 44:06.319
Let us know
if you need anything.

44:19.767 --> 44:21.969
- Miguel.
- Por favor.

44:24.437 --> 44:25.906
- Devante.

44:33.113 --> 44:35.115
- Mr. Alvarez, please.

44:37.885 --> 44:39.419
- Thank you.

44:39.452 --> 44:41.822
- Marcus.
- Miguel.

44:46.493 --> 44:49.162
- Prospect, bikes.

44:50.998 --> 44:53.300
- I'm okay if Ezekiel stays.

44:54.835 --> 44:56.236
It might be useful to have

44:56.269 --> 44:58.371
someone remember
the details of what we say.

45:17.825 --> 45:21.394
As you know, two nights ago,

45:21.428 --> 45:22.963
the U.S. attorney's office

45:22.996 --> 45:25.665
and other U.S.
and Mexican agencies

45:25.698 --> 45:28.068
invaded my home,

45:28.101 --> 45:30.570
citing some vague
Homeland Security law.

45:30.603 --> 45:35.809
They took my wife, my child,
and myself into custody,

45:35.843 --> 45:37.410
and for the next 24 hours,

45:37.444 --> 45:42.249
they intimidated
and threatened my family...

45:42.282 --> 45:44.351
then coerced me

45:44.384 --> 45:47.955
into the same type of deal
they made my father sign

45:47.988 --> 45:49.522
nearly ten years ago.

45:49.556 --> 45:51.291
- Miguel.

46:06.673 --> 46:10.310
- What you don't know,
but more importantly

46:10.343 --> 46:13.680
what the U.S. and Mexican
authorities don't know,

46:13.713 --> 46:16.049
is that the night prior
to that,

46:16.083 --> 46:19.219
while detained at the Calexico
border station,

46:19.252 --> 46:22.489
someone else offered me a deal.

46:26.026 --> 46:30.397
This is Luisa.
You know her Adelita.

46:32.099 --> 46:34.868
- No, please, gentlemen.
I'll explain everything.

46:52.752 --> 46:54.254
- Miguel.

47:15.475 --> 47:18.678
- Los Olvidados
wants only one thing.

47:18.711 --> 47:22.015
To heal its people.

47:22.049 --> 47:24.517
There's only way to cut through

47:24.551 --> 47:28.388
the layers of greed,
bureaucracy,

47:28.421 --> 47:30.557
and ignorance

47:30.590 --> 47:34.294
that have kept us broken
for decades.

47:35.996 --> 47:41.168
We need the edge of
the most dangerous blade.

47:44.637 --> 47:49.242
- My organization is no longer
at odds with Los Olvidados.

47:49.276 --> 47:51.444
The power of our new
partnership

47:51.478 --> 47:53.380
will not only allow us

47:53.413 --> 47:56.616
to outthink, outmaneuver,

47:56.649 --> 48:01.121
and exploit our
invasive governmental agencies.

48:01.154 --> 48:04.557
It also provides a network
that increases production,

48:04.591 --> 48:08.495
distribution, and profits.

48:08.528 --> 48:12.799
And for the
Mayans Motorcycle Club...

48:15.768 --> 48:20.473
It takes you from
the loading dock...

48:20.507 --> 48:24.277
to the board room.

48:24.311 --> 48:30.750
You become our trustee
to keep all parties honest.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.485
Now, my wife has put together

48:32.519 --> 48:35.188
some broad strokes as to what
this all might look like.

48:38.325 --> 48:43.163
*

49:09.856 --> 49:12.325
- We'll send over the proposal
with all the information.

49:12.359 --> 49:14.361
- Good.

49:14.394 --> 49:18.131
- We'll have to officially take
this to our table, but...

49:18.165 --> 49:20.167
we're in.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.801
- Good.

49:21.834 --> 49:23.736
Marcus, do you mind riding back
with me?

49:23.770 --> 49:25.805
Need your opinion on
a family matter.

49:25.838 --> 49:27.074
- Of course.

49:27.107 --> 49:29.242
My knees and back
will be grateful.

49:29.276 --> 49:31.611
- We'll put the bike
in the van.

49:34.581 --> 49:36.049
- I'm proud of you, primo.

49:36.083 --> 49:38.017
This happened 'cause of you,
huh?

49:46.059 --> 49:49.062
- Look forward to doing
business with you.

49:53.700 --> 49:57.003
- Hi, I'm Michael Ariza.

49:57.036 --> 49:58.671
- Hi.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.607
I'm Angel.

50:00.640 --> 50:01.941
- Luisa.

50:01.974 --> 50:05.545
Coco, Gilly.
- Hi.

50:05.578 --> 50:08.115
- Nice to meet you, Luisa.

50:08.148 --> 50:10.150
- Nice to meet you.

50:38.345 --> 50:40.347
- Hey.

50:41.948 --> 50:45.118
Sorry,
I know it's late.

50:46.253 --> 50:47.754
- It's okay.

50:47.787 --> 50:51.424
Not much sleep going on here
tonight.

50:51.458 --> 50:52.992
You want one?

50:54.661 --> 50:56.663
- I'm good.

50:58.431 --> 51:00.833
I'm heading up to San Joaquin
for a few days.

51:00.867 --> 51:02.602
Wanted to check on him before
I left.

51:02.635 --> 51:04.171
He didn't pick up his cell.

51:04.204 --> 51:06.639
- I'm not sure where he is.

51:06.673 --> 51:09.041
You hear anything?
- No.

51:10.643 --> 51:14.247
- This U.S. attorney that's
been fucking with his deal,

51:14.281 --> 51:15.915
what do you know about him?

51:15.948 --> 51:17.650
Something happen?

51:17.684 --> 51:20.920
- No, I'm just asking
a question.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.922
- Lincoln Potter.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.458
Off-the-chart weird,

51:25.492 --> 51:28.361
off-the-chart smart.

51:28.395 --> 51:32.932
He's become the DOJ's guy for
Mexico's interior struggles.

51:32.965 --> 51:37.036
Not sure how far up the food
chain his orders come from.

51:37.069 --> 51:39.206
If you hear anything,

51:39.239 --> 51:42.775
please let me know.

51:42.809 --> 51:43.810
- Ah.

51:53.486 --> 51:56.489
Bad night to quit drinking.

51:59.892 --> 52:02.395
- Could you check in
the lounge, please?

52:13.340 --> 52:15.742
- Need some more paper
shredded?

52:15.775 --> 52:17.977
Getting good at it.

52:18.010 --> 52:21.848
- Well, maybe I should ask you
the same thing...

52:21.881 --> 52:24.884
but I guess
you don't need paper.

52:24.917 --> 52:28.355
Not when you have
a beautiful mind.

52:49.242 --> 52:51.411
- You seem to have settled
into things.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.883
- I have.

52:58.418 --> 53:00.420
- I'm glad you made peace
with it.

53:02.422 --> 53:05.191
- I didn't see it in
the lounge, ma'am.

53:05.224 --> 53:07.660
- Miguel probably picked it up.
I'll be right there.

53:17.937 --> 53:19.939
- I don't know yet.

53:24.644 --> 53:27.980
Whatever you were doing
for the feds,

53:28.014 --> 53:32.419
I hope their shift with Miguel
has put an end to it.

53:32.452 --> 53:35.622
If anything you do hurts
my family--

53:35.655 --> 53:37.524
- It won't.

53:40.660 --> 53:43.095
- Don't make me choose, EZ.

54:03.149 --> 54:08.254

54:08.287 --> 54:12.759
- Just have to talk to Devante,
clear some things up.

54:12.792 --> 54:14.193
Go with Emily,

54:14.226 --> 54:17.797
and I'll join you before
you reach the freeway.

54:17.830 --> 54:19.499

huh?

55:09.749 --> 55:12.084
- Yeah.

55:12.118 --> 55:15.388
We do it to him,
can't take it back.

55:17.424 --> 55:19.459
Then it's gonna happen.

55:30.202 --> 55:37.143

56:21.020 --> 56:22.689
Miguel.

57:40.332 --> 57:41.901
