00:00.054 --> 00:01.503
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:01.546 --> 00:03.374
Why don't you simply enjoy life?

00:03.417 --> 00:04.854
Maybe you could
teach me something.

00:05.898 --> 00:07.378
Billy...

00:07.421 --> 00:09.467
Dad lost a big contract today...

00:09.511 --> 00:11.817
Can barely pay himself, so...

00:11.861 --> 00:14.428
Pete was helping me rebuild
Ida's gazebo.

00:14.472 --> 00:15.995
I could throw you
a couple of bucks.

00:16.039 --> 00:19.303
Lights on or lights out,
mi amigo.

00:23.612 --> 00:26.005
I am telling you,
I saw consciousness.

00:26.049 --> 00:28.138
Until this happens a second
time, it's a glitch.

00:28.181 --> 00:29.966
Nobody say a word about this.

00:30.009 --> 00:31.141
You hear Hartsfield woke up?

00:31.184 --> 00:32.708
Trial-of-the-Century shit, yo.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.231
Wait, what?
Is that guy serious?

00:34.274 --> 00:36.494
You've been window shopping
for months.

00:36.538 --> 00:38.583
What changed, darling? It was time.

00:38.627 --> 00:40.977
Where'd Bill go?
He didn't say goodbye.

00:41.020 --> 00:43.109
Yeah. He said something about
Brady waking up, and then...

00:43.153 --> 00:44.589
Wait. Brady woke up?

00:44.633 --> 00:47.157
Are you with me, Sadie?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.420
Oh, fuck.
Get a fucking...

00:49.463 --> 00:52.118
Get a... scalpel.
Get a scalpel, Sadie.

00:55.818 --> 00:57.776
I thought I told you to stay
at the nurses' station.

02:47.407 --> 02:51.020
Good morning, Fred.

02:51.063 --> 02:54.632
Now, you swallow up
every little bit of that.

02:54.676 --> 02:56.199
Organic don't come cheap.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.792
What are you doing here?

03:23.835 --> 03:27.012
I don't know.
Where's Mom?

03:27.056 --> 03:28.710
Mom's not here.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.892
Fix my truck.

03:36.935 --> 03:38.763
Fix your truck.

03:38.807 --> 03:40.678
What's the magic word?

03:40.722 --> 03:42.593
Please, fix my truck.

03:42.636 --> 03:44.638
Fix your truck? Huh?
You want me to fix your truck?

03:44.682 --> 03:47.250
I'll fix your truck.
Watch this.

03:49.034 --> 03:50.209
Wow!

03:50.253 --> 03:51.733
That's the truck, man.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.694
There we go.
You get up there.

03:58.043 --> 03:59.001
Look.

03:59.044 --> 04:00.524
Oh, yeah!

04:00.567 --> 04:02.221
Let's go! Hup!

04:02.265 --> 04:05.050
There we go.

04:09.968 --> 04:11.013
I'm a fireman!

04:11.056 --> 04:12.623
Yeah, you are!

04:12.666 --> 04:14.886
Whoo-whoo!

04:14.930 --> 04:17.802
Did you kill Mom, too?

04:19.456 --> 04:22.067
Just play with
the fire truck, kid.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.378
Morning.

06:04.691 --> 06:07.172
Morning.

06:07.216 --> 06:09.174
Morning, Sunshine.

06:09.218 --> 06:10.959
What are you doing?

06:11.002 --> 06:13.222
Uh... well, you said
you needed help,

06:13.265 --> 06:15.789
so here I am, helping.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.400
Was thinking more the weekend.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.880
Do you even know
what you're doing?

06:18.923 --> 06:20.707
No. I don't.

06:20.751 --> 06:21.883
Well, stop doing.

06:21.926 --> 06:23.623
I'll be back over in a minute.

06:28.019 --> 06:29.542
All right. Glue.

06:32.284 --> 06:35.157
How's school and shit?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.160
Uh... fine and shit.

06:38.203 --> 06:40.379
Seriously.
You don't talk much about it.

06:40.423 --> 06:43.469
Who wants to talk about?
It's Harvard.

06:43.513 --> 06:45.689
The brand speaks for itself,
you know?

06:45.732 --> 06:47.386
What's wrong with it?

06:47.430 --> 06:48.387
Nothing.

06:48.431 --> 06:49.823
Clearly there is.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.521
Clearly to who?
You?

06:51.564 --> 06:55.264
It's fucking Harvard.
It's Ivy League.

06:55.307 --> 06:56.918
Okay? Case closed.

06:58.789 --> 07:00.747
Read that.

07:00.791 --> 07:01.966
Where you going?

07:02.010 --> 07:03.750
To see a man about a horse.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.230
A what?

07:08.538 --> 07:10.714
What, are you passing me notes?

07:10.757 --> 07:11.933
What are we, in sixth grade?

07:11.976 --> 07:13.325
Open it.

07:18.983 --> 07:22.030
Wow.

07:22.073 --> 07:23.292
I'm a little, um...

07:24.815 --> 07:27.165
Just tell me which ones
don't make the cut. I...

07:27.209 --> 07:29.907
Seriously, I-I just threw it
together in between meetings.

07:29.951 --> 07:31.996
Well, is, um...

07:32.040 --> 07:33.780
Is Camden
a boy or a girl's name?

07:33.824 --> 07:35.695
Either.

07:35.739 --> 07:38.002
Covers our bases if the kid
ever wants to transition.

07:38.046 --> 07:40.135
Well...

07:40.178 --> 07:42.702
I'm not a "president's last name
for first name" kind of guy,

07:42.746 --> 07:44.704
so Madison and Reagan are out.

07:44.748 --> 07:46.880
Okay.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.362
Mm, Harper's nice, Tucker, Finn.

07:52.147 --> 07:53.235
What?

07:55.106 --> 07:57.239
Come on.
Seriously?

07:57.282 --> 07:59.415
What?

07:59.458 --> 08:01.330
You can't let one Jonathan

08:01.373 --> 08:04.246
ruin a very strong name
with biblical roots.

08:05.421 --> 08:07.423
Pettimore does not own it.

08:07.466 --> 08:08.990
Besides, he's off
your back now, anyway.

08:09.033 --> 08:11.079
All you need to do
is focus on Hartsfield

08:11.122 --> 08:14.125
and our growing family.

08:14.169 --> 08:16.258
I like the sound of that.
Mm-hmm.

08:18.434 --> 08:22.220
How is the star patient, anyway?

08:22.264 --> 08:24.005
There's been no change
since he came out of his coma,

08:24.048 --> 08:25.745
but I'm optimistic.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.619
Why?

08:29.662 --> 08:31.577
You know these Beijing types...

08:31.621 --> 08:33.535
"return on our investment,"
all that.

08:33.578 --> 08:36.365
Yeah, well, you tell him,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

08:36.408 --> 08:39.759
No, but modern Shanghai
sort of was.

08:39.803 --> 08:40.760
Ah, shit.
I got to shower.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.066
Mm.

08:42.110 --> 08:43.850
What about Daschel?

08:43.894 --> 08:45.374
Daschel?

08:45.417 --> 08:48.116
Are you kidding?
"Dash" is so cute.

08:54.861 --> 08:56.820
Sadie?
Sadie McDonald?

08:56.863 --> 08:58.256
Yeah.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.953
I saw something glinting
in her hand.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.564
She's a lamb.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.218
Maggie, I know
when someone's approaching me

09:03.261 --> 09:05.263
with malevolent intent,
believe me.

09:05.307 --> 09:06.830
So, this "glinting" thing
you saw...

09:06.873 --> 09:08.092
Where did it go?

09:08.136 --> 09:09.050
I don't know.
I lost sight of it.

09:09.093 --> 09:11.748
Thankfully, not in me.

09:11.791 --> 09:13.097
Let's see if we can find out,
would we?

09:13.141 --> 09:13.967
Come on.
Let's take a look.

09:16.796 --> 09:18.015
My point.

09:18.059 --> 09:20.887
Just wait a second.

09:23.238 --> 09:24.761
Didn't mean to scare you off.

09:24.804 --> 09:26.589
You didn't scare me.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.373
I thought I told you to stay
at the nurses' station!

09:48.045 --> 09:49.568
It'd be like someone telling you

09:49.612 --> 09:51.657
Mother Teresa
collected machine guns.

09:51.701 --> 09:53.833
It It does not track.

09:53.877 --> 09:55.139
Not even a little.

09:55.183 --> 09:56.749
Let's get you out of here

09:56.793 --> 09:58.838
before Babineau comes back
and I get fired.

09:58.882 --> 10:01.319
You're lucky Hartsfield's out
getting trached.

10:01.363 --> 10:03.408
Sadie still here?

10:03.452 --> 10:05.410
No, she worked a swing shift.
She's probably home in bed.

10:06.759 --> 10:07.978
Where's home?

10:10.372 --> 10:11.808
Give me that before
you hurt yourself.

10:11.851 --> 10:13.853
I'll write the address down.

10:18.858 --> 10:20.947
Where have you been?

10:20.991 --> 10:22.471
Out and about.

10:24.037 --> 10:26.953
Okay, but could you
be more specific?

10:26.997 --> 10:28.781
Suppose I could.

10:28.825 --> 10:30.827
I was shopping
for a new suppository.

10:30.870 --> 10:33.699
So many...
exciting choices.

10:33.743 --> 10:36.702
It's a delight just to flip
through the catalog.

10:36.746 --> 10:39.227
I've been test-driving
the merchandise, as well.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.055
I mean, the morning
just flew by.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.666
You're trying to gain
dominion over me

10:43.709 --> 10:46.321
by proffering a vulgar visual.

10:51.369 --> 10:54.329
So... that guy that you talked to
the other day,

10:54.372 --> 10:56.853
the one who saw De La Cruz
at the campsite,

10:56.896 --> 10:59.812
did you, um,
happen to get his name?

10:59.856 --> 11:01.074
I did, yeah.

11:03.251 --> 11:05.818
You know,
I must have left it at home.

11:05.862 --> 11:07.298
I was kind of hoping
that you and I could focus

11:07.342 --> 11:08.865
on something else today...

11:08.908 --> 11:10.475
Something with
a little more teeth.

11:10.519 --> 11:11.998
I'd rather collect the bounty.

11:13.478 --> 11:15.176
Holly...

11:15.219 --> 11:18.309
you understand that
if we apprehend this gentleman,

11:18.353 --> 11:21.094
he could be killed
by some very bad people?

11:21.138 --> 11:24.185
Leaving his two boys behind
for the state to raise.

11:24.228 --> 11:26.709
Did you let De La Cruz go?

11:31.975 --> 11:33.803
You did, didn't you?

11:33.846 --> 11:37.285
The people we're chasing...
They're barely scraping by.

11:37.328 --> 11:38.460
That's irrelevant.

11:38.503 --> 11:40.723
Not to me.
You lied to me!

11:40.766 --> 11:43.116
About De La Cruz, about Brady.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.249
Yeah, I know that he's out
of his coma...

11:45.293 --> 11:47.860
Jerome told me... which means
that you lied to me twice

11:47.904 --> 11:51.081
in a very short... Because I find your
position on the issue unreasonable!

11:51.124 --> 11:53.518
These cases
that you're taking on,

11:53.562 --> 11:56.086
they've become harder and harder
for me to stomach, all right?

11:56.129 --> 11:58.654
The lady whose vehicle
we repossessed,

11:58.697 --> 12:01.874
there was a baby's car seat
in the back, for fuck's sake!

12:01.918 --> 12:03.789
But...

12:04.834 --> 12:08.620
Look, a person who puts in
a hard day's work,

12:08.664 --> 12:10.056
at the end of the day,

12:10.100 --> 12:12.450
they want it to count
for something.

12:12.494 --> 12:14.670
Is this what you want your days
to count for?

12:14.713 --> 12:15.758
Really?

12:18.717 --> 12:21.503
Well, the only thing
that seems to count to you

12:21.546 --> 12:23.374
is Brady Hartsfield.

12:23.418 --> 12:26.159
He's not the only thing,
but he matters, yes.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.771
Preying on innocent people
down on their luck, it doesn't.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.208
It's horseshit!

12:31.252 --> 12:33.384
I make no apologies
for saying it.

12:36.561 --> 12:38.389
I...

12:38.433 --> 12:41.784
I hear your arguments.
Okay? I do.

12:41.827 --> 12:45.266
And when you put them
that... colorfully,

12:45.309 --> 12:48.530
I see that they are deeply felt.

12:50.619 --> 12:51.837
That being said...

12:54.362 --> 12:57.974
I am an equal partner.

12:58.017 --> 12:59.367
I need to be treated like one.

13:03.675 --> 13:05.024
Fair enough.

13:08.071 --> 13:09.377
Good.

13:11.901 --> 13:13.816
Speaking of partners,

13:13.859 --> 13:15.687
I'm in need of one right now,

13:15.731 --> 13:17.036
if you'll help me.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.473
Let's go.

13:18.516 --> 13:19.430
Oh.

13:19.474 --> 13:21.563
Yeah. Okay.

13:24.305 --> 13:26.350
Who's paying us for this?

13:26.394 --> 13:27.220
No one.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.920
I'd like to take
this opportunity to mention

13:30.963 --> 13:32.487
that I could be back
at the office right now

13:32.530 --> 13:34.576
maximizing my time
on a paying case.

13:34.619 --> 13:37.056
And instead, we're sitting
outside a house

13:37.100 --> 13:39.320
of someone whose name
I don't even know.

13:42.410 --> 13:45.195
Her name is Sadie McDonald.

13:45.238 --> 13:47.589
She lives here with her mother.

13:47.632 --> 13:51.027
She's also a nurse at Mercy Gen.

13:51.070 --> 13:53.421
I believe she tried to stab me
with a scalpel last night

13:53.464 --> 13:57.163
when I was visiting Brady.

13:57.207 --> 13:58.861
I did not expect that.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.124
- Heads up.
- You're saying it's too much?

14:01.167 --> 14:03.082
I'm saying it's a lot.

14:03.126 --> 14:05.650
Of course it's a lot.
To take.

14:05.694 --> 14:06.912
"To take"? Okay.

14:06.956 --> 14:09.698
Yes, to take.Yeah. All right.

14:09.741 --> 14:11.090
Sadie!

14:11.134 --> 14:13.658
Where are you going? To work, Matthew!

14:13.702 --> 14:15.094
Sadie.

14:15.138 --> 14:17.967
Sadie, come on!

14:19.795 --> 14:21.144
Wheels up.
What?

14:21.187 --> 14:22.537
Start the fucking car.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.016
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.759
I-I am. Okay.

14:31.763 --> 14:32.808
Ta-da!
Ta-da!

14:34.287 --> 14:36.942
You heard a rumor
he's barely awake,

14:36.986 --> 14:39.205
and you ran out and did that.

14:41.251 --> 14:44.907
I mean, I-I've been talking
about it for a while.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.430
Yeah.

14:46.474 --> 14:50.303
I thought you were kidding.

14:53.481 --> 14:56.919
Yeah.
I... wasn't kidding.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.834
I mean, I showed you sketches.

15:00.836 --> 15:03.447
What's your shrink say about it?

15:03.491 --> 15:06.624
Whoa, what the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

15:12.369 --> 15:14.284
What?

15:14.327 --> 15:16.112
I know you haven't been going.

15:16.155 --> 15:17.548
Do you follow me?

15:18.723 --> 15:20.638
Wow.

15:20.682 --> 15:23.249
That is some girlfriend. I'm trying to be.

15:23.293 --> 15:27.036
Lou, I love you, but
you're making this really hard.

15:27.079 --> 15:29.908
You don't see your therapist.
You sleep till noon.

15:29.952 --> 15:32.084
I do your laundry.

15:32.128 --> 15:34.652
I need to see Brady
face-to-face.

15:34.696 --> 15:37.046
That is a bad idea.

15:37.089 --> 15:39.265
I need to show him

15:39.309 --> 15:42.051
that I survived.

15:42.094 --> 15:45.097
And that is the only way
that I can move on.

15:56.718 --> 15:58.894
Go see your therapist.

15:58.937 --> 16:02.463
If she says go...
I won't stand in your way.

16:20.263 --> 16:21.873
Okay, I'm going in.

16:21.917 --> 16:23.875
When she comes out,
follow two cars behind.

16:23.919 --> 16:26.965
Don't lose her at the lights.
I'll get a cab back.

16:27.009 --> 16:29.315
Wait. Wait.
You're leaving me?

16:29.359 --> 16:31.709
You'll be fine.
Just don't get made.

16:31.753 --> 16:33.581
O-Okay.

16:33.624 --> 16:36.627
I won't get made.

16:53.862 --> 16:54.558
How much?

16:54.602 --> 16:56.081
$20.

17:13.055 --> 17:14.578
Oh. Go?

17:14.622 --> 17:15.797
Okay.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.200
May I help you, sir?

17:28.243 --> 17:30.376
Are these all
St. Anne medallions?

17:30.420 --> 17:32.465
You know your saints.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.772
Mm.
She's pretty popular.

17:34.816 --> 17:38.036
Oh, among women more than men.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.342
Oh, why's that?

17:39.385 --> 17:41.866
Because men can't get pregnant.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.177
Hello?

17:48.220 --> 17:50.483
Where are you now? Um, she stopped at

17:50.527 --> 17:53.138
an herbalist/chiropractor/
acupuncturist.

17:53.182 --> 17:54.270
Which one?

17:54.313 --> 17:55.619
It's all three,

17:55.663 --> 17:58.840
at least according
to Dr. Chen's sign.

18:00.885 --> 18:03.018
Oh, wait. She's coming out.
What's she doing?

18:03.061 --> 18:05.847
Oh, she's looking at me.

18:05.890 --> 18:09.241
And then another way.

18:09.285 --> 18:11.548
Now back at me again.

18:11.592 --> 18:13.898
Oh, fuck.
She made you.

18:13.942 --> 18:15.596
Wait, s-she did?
Wait, how?

18:15.639 --> 18:18.163
Uh, you probably hung too close
in traffic or something.

18:18.207 --> 18:19.817
Listen, just let her get going,
all right,

18:19.861 --> 18:22.428
and you go in and find out
what you can about the doctor.

18:22.472 --> 18:23.647
I'll meet you back
at the office.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.825
Do you understand what I mean

18:27.869 --> 18:30.567
when I say the pain is old?

18:30.611 --> 18:32.395
Which pain?

18:32.438 --> 18:35.180
Like...
the first thrust,

18:35.224 --> 18:36.486
when the knife found
my small intestines

18:36.529 --> 18:38.096
or the second one
that nicked my kidneys

18:38.140 --> 18:40.403
or the third one
that pierced my spleen?

18:40.446 --> 18:42.840
The pain you've been feeling
your whole life.

18:42.884 --> 18:45.669
Um...

18:45.713 --> 18:46.888
okay.

18:46.931 --> 18:50.848
On a scale of 1 to 10,

18:50.892 --> 18:52.720
being stabbed
by Brady Hartsfield

18:52.763 --> 18:54.678
is like a 600,000,

18:54.722 --> 18:56.506
and my boo-hoo
childhood complaints

18:56.549 --> 18:58.290
come in at about a 3.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.292
No one is dismissing the horror

19:00.336 --> 19:02.207
of what Brady Hartsfield
did to you.

19:02.251 --> 19:04.819
No one, least of all me.

19:04.862 --> 19:09.084
You have made so much progress

19:09.127 --> 19:11.129
since you started coming in here
to see me.

19:11.173 --> 19:15.917
Progress?
I'm a fucking disaster zone.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.008
You have traumas going back
to your childhood

19:20.051 --> 19:23.489
that you haven't even begun
to unpack.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.448
If you confront Brady

19:25.491 --> 19:28.190
to address traumas
that predate him,

19:28.233 --> 19:30.453
you could suffer
a significant setback,

19:30.496 --> 19:34.196
potentially even...
some sort of breakdown.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.328
Mm.

19:40.724 --> 19:42.073
Fuck off.

19:42.117 --> 19:44.293
If you confront Brady Hartsfield

19:44.336 --> 19:47.949
without a full understanding
of the dynamics in play,

19:47.992 --> 19:51.039
he could finish the job he
started on you and Edmund Mills.

19:51.082 --> 19:52.388
You think you can help me?

19:52.431 --> 19:53.737
If you let me.

19:53.781 --> 19:55.043
Mm, I won't.

19:55.086 --> 19:56.087
Why?

19:56.131 --> 19:57.654
Ah...

20:00.004 --> 20:02.746
Because...

20:02.790 --> 20:04.400
I'm not worth it.

20:04.443 --> 20:05.836
Yes, you are.

20:08.230 --> 20:11.624
Not until I take my life back...
from Brady.

20:14.149 --> 20:16.804
Until then, I'm nothing.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.078
What are you doing here?

20:30.121 --> 20:31.862
Nice to see you, too.

20:31.906 --> 20:34.082
Well, I just needed
a little IT help.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.171
Yeah, you guys have some bugs
in your accounting system,

20:36.214 --> 20:37.650
so I figured I'd help.Mm-hmm.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.218
Well, your father will have
my balls in a nutcracker

20:40.262 --> 20:41.437
if he thinks I'm employing you.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.655
So make it quick.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.049
Another vulgar visual.
Thank you.

20:45.093 --> 20:47.051
I'm finishing up now, so...

20:47.095 --> 20:48.836
Anything on the doctor?

20:48.879 --> 20:51.534
Yes. Uh, he specializes
in homeopathic

20:51.577 --> 20:54.276
and non-Western treatment
for epilepsy.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.757
Epilepsy.
Sadie's an epileptic.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.020
Well, that's what he treats,
and that's where she goes.

20:59.063 --> 21:00.673
I mean, he treats people
who want to get off

21:00.717 --> 21:03.938
their conventional medication
for antiseizures.

21:03.981 --> 21:05.417
Oh, and get this.

21:05.461 --> 21:07.724
One of the risks
of going off your meds

21:07.768 --> 21:12.076
is a chaotic state,
or possibly a psychotic state,

21:12.120 --> 21:15.819
which would explain
why she picked up the scalpel.

21:15.863 --> 21:17.516
Okay, good.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.388
Excellent, Holly.

21:19.431 --> 21:21.042
Thank you.

21:21.085 --> 21:23.740
But the day isn't over yet.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.307
Sadie's back
at her boyfriend's house.

21:25.350 --> 21:28.092
So... this time,
you need to tail me.

21:28.136 --> 21:29.615
Let's go.
Oh, wait.

21:29.659 --> 21:31.574
Um, I'm gonna go to the bathroom
real quick.

21:31.617 --> 21:33.141
Hey, I'll e-mail
you the rest from home.

21:33.184 --> 21:35.099
Okay.

21:42.890 --> 21:44.848
So, what's wrong with Harvard?

21:46.632 --> 21:48.721
Hmm.

21:48.765 --> 21:51.420
Just...
I don't know.

21:51.463 --> 21:54.902
Not what I expected, you know?

21:54.945 --> 21:57.643
Yeah, sure.

21:57.687 --> 22:01.212
You've never lived away
from home, different city.

22:01.256 --> 22:02.518
It's a whole different world

22:02.561 --> 22:04.868
where most of these people
come from.

22:04.912 --> 22:07.262
Like, they speak
a different language.

22:07.305 --> 22:09.786
Some secret code.

22:09.830 --> 22:13.355
Yeah.

22:13.398 --> 22:14.878
I remember when I was
about your age,

22:14.922 --> 22:18.839
I dated this girl
from Sugar Heights, right?

22:20.841 --> 22:23.713
Ah, she was a brilliant girl.
She was really very fun.

22:25.019 --> 22:28.457
We had a fine time of it, but...

22:28.500 --> 22:31.373
every time I went
over to her place,

22:31.416 --> 22:33.854
I was afraid
I'd break something.

22:36.421 --> 22:40.991
Like...
she'd take me out to dinner

22:41.035 --> 22:42.645
to the "club" or something.

22:42.688 --> 22:44.908
It was like I always seemed
to use the wrong utensil

22:44.952 --> 22:48.869
or knock over a glass of water
or something.

22:50.479 --> 22:52.829
I didn't live
in that world, you know?

22:52.873 --> 22:54.483
I didn't belong.

22:57.703 --> 23:00.968
But, like, she never made me
feel that I didn't belong.

23:03.361 --> 23:06.408
I made me feel that way.

23:06.451 --> 23:09.933
In the end...

23:09.977 --> 23:12.066
we broke up.

23:13.763 --> 23:15.852
And it gets... gets lonely.

23:16.984 --> 23:19.116
It'll get less so.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.077
It will.

23:41.530 --> 23:42.487
Hello?

23:42.531 --> 23:43.488
Hello.

23:43.532 --> 23:45.316
Yeah. Hi.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.797
You don't park
in front of the house

23:47.840 --> 23:49.364
of the person
you're surveilling.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.108
W-Where are you?
I don't...

23:54.151 --> 23:55.848
If you find me,

23:55.892 --> 23:59.765
you'll see how it's done,
grasshopper.

23:59.809 --> 24:01.071
Grass-what?

24:01.115 --> 24:02.551
Just look.

24:05.858 --> 24:07.425
Oh. There you are.

24:07.469 --> 24:09.036
Yeah. And move.

24:09.079 --> 24:10.820
Yeah, I am.
I'm sorry.

24:10.863 --> 24:12.517
I'm just...

24:12.561 --> 24:14.780
not very good at this.

24:14.824 --> 24:16.478
This... Okay.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.355
Just drive past me here.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.968
Keep going.

24:28.011 --> 24:29.491
Hi.

24:29.534 --> 24:31.275
All right,
make a three-point turn.

24:31.319 --> 24:32.798
Park in behind me.

24:32.842 --> 24:34.583
A three-point turn?

24:34.626 --> 24:36.759
Just... A U-turn, whatever.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.552
I feel quite incompetent.

24:47.596 --> 24:49.293
Okay.

24:49.337 --> 24:51.034
No reason for you
to feel that way.

24:51.078 --> 24:52.601
How can you know
what you don't know?

24:52.644 --> 24:54.603
I know. On the way here,
I nearly lost you,

24:54.646 --> 24:57.127
if I counted correctly,
13 times.

24:57.171 --> 24:59.477
Well, you know, field work
was never your forte,

24:59.521 --> 25:01.566
but it's important
that you learn.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.786
Why now? So you know how to do it.

25:03.829 --> 25:06.136
I know, but won't you
just be in the field?

25:06.180 --> 25:08.965
Well, just in case
I'm s-sick or I can't.

25:09.009 --> 25:11.663
Well, why can't you
if you're not sick?

25:11.707 --> 25:13.796
I... All I'm saying is that
it's important to be prepared.

25:13.839 --> 25:15.580
Wait. Are you sick? No, I'm not sick.

25:15.624 --> 25:17.017
Okay. Now, listen, I'm
gonna take your car,

25:17.060 --> 25:18.496
and you sit in mine, okay?

25:18.540 --> 25:21.456
Okay. Right.
Because my car was "made"?

25:21.499 --> 25:23.849
Exactly. Good. Well done.
That's it. Okay.

25:23.893 --> 25:25.808
Now, just note
where I am, right?

25:25.851 --> 25:28.289
Up the street
with plenty of things

25:28.332 --> 25:30.552
to take the eye between me
and her house, all right?

25:30.595 --> 25:35.035
Now, where is Sadie's car,
in relation to the house?

25:35.078 --> 25:36.949
Just north of it... south of it.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.516
South of it, right. Where's mine?
Yes.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.736
North of it.
That's right.

25:40.779 --> 25:42.912
So it means when she walks
out of the house,

25:42.955 --> 25:45.567
she will naturally look left
rather than right, okay,

25:45.610 --> 25:47.482
further minimizing the chances
of her seeing me.

25:47.525 --> 25:49.092
Well, in this case, you.

25:49.136 --> 25:50.572
Wait.
Why am I doing this?

25:50.615 --> 25:52.356
You're gonna put her
to sleep, okay?

25:52.400 --> 25:53.966
Now, it seems pretty clear to me
that she's gonna sleep

25:54.010 --> 25:56.099
at her boyfriend's this evening.Wait.
Why can't I...

25:56.143 --> 25:57.796
How can I possibly
put her to sleep

25:57.840 --> 25:59.711
when your car is parked like
half a block away?

25:59.755 --> 26:02.105
No, no, that's a euphemism.Oh.

26:02.149 --> 26:04.803
Euphemism.
It's a euphemism, okay? What's...

26:04.847 --> 26:08.111
So, I need to know
if she moves within, say,

26:08.155 --> 26:09.591
the next few hours, that's all.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.506
Okay, so I'm just supposed
to sit in your car

26:11.549 --> 26:12.811
and just wait... Until she goes to sleep.
That's right.

26:12.855 --> 26:14.552
Okay.
And where will you be?

26:14.596 --> 26:17.207
I-I-I got...
I got things to tend to.

26:17.251 --> 26:19.122
You've been doing
a lot of that lately.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.516
Yeah, just watch the
house, would ya? Yes.

26:21.559 --> 26:23.431
Is the key in here?
Yes.

27:33.849 --> 27:35.198
Can I help you?

27:35.242 --> 27:36.504
Are you the homeowner?

27:36.547 --> 27:39.289
Yeah.

27:39.333 --> 27:42.466
And I...
And I have a license to carry.

27:42.510 --> 27:45.077
Uh, uh, I'm William Hodges.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.644
I'm a private investigator.

27:46.688 --> 27:49.430
Can I see a badge?
Or a card?

27:49.473 --> 27:50.909
Yes, of course.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

27:50.953 --> 27:53.695
I'm investigating some
malpractice at Mercy General.

27:53.738 --> 27:55.436
I was wondering, could I speak
with your daughter?

27:55.479 --> 27:57.220
Is my daughter involved?

27:57.264 --> 27:59.831
Ah, no, no. I just want
to ask her a few questions.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.659
Who are you working for?
The hospital?

28:01.703 --> 28:03.531
I'm not at liberty to say.

28:04.358 --> 28:05.402
Calling the police.

28:10.712 --> 28:12.409
Fuck it!

29:05.419 --> 29:08.378
Everybody told me
I shouldn't come see you.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.817
But I had to.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.016
I had to come and look you...

29:40.323 --> 29:43.718
I had to look you
in your shitty, little...

29:43.761 --> 29:45.633
cloudy eye.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.123
You're nothing.

30:10.397 --> 30:11.354
Shh!

30:19.406 --> 30:21.582
Aah! Fuck!
Fuck.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.279
It's a dream.
Hey, it's okay.

30:26.848 --> 30:30.460
Ohh! It's just a dream.
Go back to sleep.

30:32.810 --> 30:34.899
Go to sleep.
It's a dream.

31:25.254 --> 31:26.386
Hi.

31:26.429 --> 31:28.170
Hiya.

31:28.213 --> 31:30.215
Um...

31:30.259 --> 31:31.826
what's up?

31:31.869 --> 31:34.437
I, uh...

31:35.917 --> 31:37.745
Just dropping by?

31:37.788 --> 31:39.311
Yeah.

31:39.355 --> 31:42.053
Uh, I...

31:42.097 --> 31:43.968
Okay, yeah, sure, yeah, yeah.
By all means.

31:44.012 --> 31:45.274
Okay.
Thanks.

31:48.190 --> 31:49.452
Thanks.

31:49.496 --> 31:51.454
Tough day at work, honey?

31:54.065 --> 31:57.460
A woman and her daughter are...

31:57.504 --> 32:00.289
Well, they seem
quite perturbed with me.

32:00.332 --> 32:02.465
Mm-hmm.
For no good reason, I'm sure.

32:02.509 --> 32:04.293
Well, the mother I get.

32:04.336 --> 32:07.644
The daughter
is a head-scratcher.

32:07.688 --> 32:09.080
You didn't brace her

32:09.124 --> 32:11.039
with your refreshing level
of candor?

32:11.082 --> 32:12.910
No.

32:12.954 --> 32:14.651
Charm her
with your serene temperament?

32:14.695 --> 32:15.957
No.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.785
Serve her papers?
No.

32:17.828 --> 32:19.482
Chase her down
for an old warrant? No, no, no, no.

32:19.526 --> 32:21.136
Speak crossly to her?

32:21.179 --> 32:22.267
Uh, no.

32:22.311 --> 32:23.791
Well, this is baffling.

32:23.834 --> 32:24.879
Mm.

32:27.359 --> 32:29.753
So, uh... So is this.

32:32.147 --> 32:33.235
Old times.

32:33.278 --> 32:34.454
No.

32:34.497 --> 32:36.194
No.

32:36.238 --> 32:38.501
Old times would be you carrying

32:38.545 --> 32:41.765
the toxic cloud of a failed case
into the house

32:41.809 --> 32:44.551
and refusing to talk about it.

32:44.594 --> 32:47.162
And then drinking right through dinner.

32:50.513 --> 32:52.341
Is that what this feels like?

32:56.345 --> 32:59.174
No, no. I...

32:59.217 --> 33:01.002
honestly don't know
what this feels like.

33:04.875 --> 33:07.965
What, um...

33:08.009 --> 33:09.401
What are you doing here, Bill?

33:14.145 --> 33:15.320
I miss you.

33:19.673 --> 33:21.979
Got to the end of watch,
as we used to say,

33:22.023 --> 33:25.330
and I-I just couldn't think
of anybody else I wanted to see.

33:27.985 --> 33:30.988
What are we doing?

33:31.032 --> 33:33.164
You know, you, uh...

33:33.208 --> 33:36.037
You misread the situation
at the bar so spectacularly.

33:36.080 --> 33:36.994
Did I?

33:37.038 --> 33:38.561
Yeah. Yeah.

33:38.605 --> 33:40.563
Well, you agreed to the drink.
Uh...

33:40.607 --> 33:43.044
And you sent me the photo
after the funeral.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.437
It was of Pete.
Right. Yeah.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.397
Just 'cause I'm heading
into me dotage

33:48.440 --> 33:50.181
doesn't mean I've forgotten
what flirting looks like.

33:51.835 --> 33:53.968
Might not be dotage.

33:54.011 --> 33:56.579
Might just be alcohol.

33:56.623 --> 33:58.189
I'm not drunk.
Hmm?

33:58.233 --> 34:00.191
Nope.
Hmm.

34:00.235 --> 34:02.629
Mildly buzzed.
Oh.

34:02.672 --> 34:03.673
I did have a couple
before I came over.

34:03.717 --> 34:05.066
You?

34:05.109 --> 34:08.243
Uh, no, I'm not drunk.

34:08.286 --> 34:10.331
Mildly buzzed.

34:15.728 --> 34:18.949
My turn.

34:18.993 --> 34:20.297
What are we doing?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.128
I don't fucking know.

34:28.437 --> 34:33.050
Uh, maybe it's because...

34:33.094 --> 34:34.965
I got divorced
for the second time.

34:35.009 --> 34:37.272
Maybe it's because...

34:37.315 --> 34:42.103
I have a shaky relationship
with our kid.

34:42.146 --> 34:43.452
Maybe it's because I don't know

34:43.495 --> 34:45.280
if I'm gonna
make partner or not.

34:45.322 --> 34:49.239
Maybe I don't care.

34:49.284 --> 34:52.069
Uh, I mean, this...
This is the sum of my life.

34:56.639 --> 34:59.555
Sitting across
from you yesterday,

34:59.599 --> 35:01.426
from somebody

35:01.470 --> 35:05.561
I didn't have
to explain myself to,

35:05.605 --> 35:10.914
somebody who knows me
just felt...

35:10.958 --> 35:15.223
felt good.

35:23.797 --> 35:26.756
I can work with that.

35:36.679 --> 35:37.854
Nibbles?

35:39.682 --> 35:41.597
Come on.

35:51.389 --> 35:54.741
Time to finish what
you've started, big brother.

35:54.784 --> 35:56.656
I know.

35:58.005 --> 36:01.051
Let's burn it all down.

36:01.095 --> 36:03.271
Yeah?

36:03.314 --> 36:05.577
Let's burn it all down!

36:24.684 --> 36:28.209
Mm.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.733
Ohh, I did not see
this morning coming.

36:40.874 --> 36:42.658
That was a lovely one, though.

36:42.702 --> 36:44.094
Mm.

36:54.888 --> 36:56.498
So, who are these women?

36:56.541 --> 36:58.239
Huh?

36:58.282 --> 37:01.155
These women who took
such a shine to you?

37:01.198 --> 37:02.983
Oh.
Yeah?

37:03.026 --> 37:04.680
Case you're...
You're working on?

37:04.724 --> 37:05.812
Yes.

37:09.163 --> 37:10.251
One of them is no big deal.

37:10.294 --> 37:11.948
The other is...

37:11.992 --> 37:13.776
It's...

37:13.820 --> 37:14.908
Mm-hmm.
Just spit it out.

37:14.951 --> 37:17.040
Come on.

37:20.261 --> 37:22.306
She's a nurse.

37:25.092 --> 37:26.789
When I was by the hospital
the other night,

37:26.833 --> 37:30.358
I'm pretty sure she was planning
to cut my throat.

37:30.401 --> 37:32.229
But she was interrupted.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.756
You don't know her?

37:36.799 --> 37:40.368
No. I mean, I've seen her
a few times at the hospital,

37:40.411 --> 37:42.805
nodded to her once or twice,
but that's it.

37:47.201 --> 37:50.334
What kind of nurse is she?

37:52.293 --> 37:55.557
One of Brady Hartsfield's.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.341
Hey.

38:03.304 --> 38:06.742
It follows you, you know?

38:06.786 --> 38:07.917
The darkness.

38:09.527 --> 38:11.051
Aw, come on.

38:11.094 --> 38:12.922
Didn't take long
for this greatest hits

38:12.966 --> 38:15.490
to be put back on the turntable, did it?
It does. It does.

38:15.533 --> 38:19.015
It's... It's like you
pull in violence

38:19.059 --> 38:20.930
and... and hurt

38:20.974 --> 38:23.759
and the dark.

38:26.196 --> 38:29.634
Well, I'm not trying to.

38:29.678 --> 38:31.593
I'm trying to limit
the damage it does.

38:36.903 --> 38:38.948
Hey. Listen.

38:38.992 --> 38:41.037
I'm not judging you.
I'm not.

38:41.081 --> 38:43.300
Listen.
Hear me, okay?

38:45.172 --> 38:48.218
I love that
you're talking to me.

38:48.262 --> 38:50.960
I love that you're sharing.

38:55.182 --> 38:56.748
I'm gonna go.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.577
It's all feeling
like yesteryear lately.

39:04.931 --> 39:07.368
Oh, gosh.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.467
You could just turn
your back on it.

39:19.510 --> 39:20.772
What?

39:20.816 --> 39:23.297
Just walk away.

39:23.340 --> 39:27.823
Don't go near this nurse
or these other women.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.912
Stay away from Brady Hartsfield.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.656
Just choose the sun.

39:34.699 --> 39:35.962
That's it?

39:40.662 --> 39:44.448
People got killed,
and I get a suntan.

39:44.492 --> 39:45.928
This nurse could be dangerous,
you know.

39:45.972 --> 39:47.495
To who?

39:47.538 --> 39:50.324
To her patients,
to herself, to me.

39:50.367 --> 39:52.717
Okay, all right. Okay.

39:52.761 --> 39:58.288
Well... uh, how about
after you save the day, you...

39:58.332 --> 40:00.856
You actually enjoy some of it?

40:00.900 --> 40:02.597
What do you mean?

40:02.640 --> 40:05.774
Um, like take a trip.

40:06.949 --> 40:08.255
A trip?

40:10.997 --> 40:13.042
- Where?
- I don't know.

40:13.086 --> 40:14.957
Anywhere.
You're... You're retired.

40:19.788 --> 40:20.789
A trip?

40:22.486 --> 40:24.619
You need to get that?

40:24.662 --> 40:26.273
Where would we take a trip?

40:26.316 --> 40:27.796
"We"?

40:27.839 --> 40:30.016
I didn't say "we."

40:31.843 --> 40:32.757
Why not?

40:50.688 --> 40:51.994
Hello?

40:52.038 --> 40:54.431
Hey.
What's the news?

40:54.475 --> 40:57.652
Mm, she just finished
going for a run.

40:57.695 --> 41:00.742
She mailed some letters
and took out the trash.

41:00.785 --> 41:03.266
It's been... riveting.

41:03.310 --> 41:05.442
Sit on her
till she goes to work.

41:05.486 --> 41:06.966
We'll switch cars
at the hospital.

41:07.009 --> 41:09.055
Wait. Doesn't she work
the night shift?

41:09.098 --> 41:11.361
Well, you're a quick study.

41:20.501 --> 41:23.634
Are you serious? Yeah. I, uh...

41:23.678 --> 41:25.027
It's gotten
the better of me up here.

41:25.071 --> 41:27.856
I'm getting headaches
from the stress.

41:29.510 --> 41:32.774
Go wash the Superstar.

41:32.817 --> 41:34.254
Do I have to?

41:34.297 --> 41:35.559
Yeah.

41:35.603 --> 41:37.822
Till you transfer out,
it's your job.

41:56.841 --> 41:59.322
Yeah, I'm at work.

41:59.366 --> 42:01.585
Yes, I put the transfer request.

42:01.629 --> 42:04.371
Okay, yeah. I have g...
I've got to go.

42:04.414 --> 42:06.982
Matthew, I have to go!

42:11.117 --> 42:13.902
Come on, Sadie.
You can do this.

42:41.234 --> 42:43.497
Same feeling again.

42:43.540 --> 42:48.241
I used to love this job.
Transfer out.

42:48.284 --> 42:52.897
Transferring?!
How fucking dare you!

42:52.941 --> 42:57.337
Fine! Fine! Fine!

42:57.380 --> 42:59.382
You're a liability, anyway!

43:27.541 --> 43:31.719
And we're back!

43:31.762 --> 43:37.203
How about we have some fun
before you leave, huh?

43:48.649 --> 43:50.085
Take me to the sweeties.

44:02.228 --> 44:04.360
Oh, Mr. Conlan,
one of the lucky ones.

44:04.404 --> 44:07.102
Opiates on the reg.

44:07.146 --> 44:08.930
God bless America.

44:08.973 --> 44:11.541
Mr. Conlan.

44:11.585 --> 44:14.544
Let's get you your opiates.

44:22.161 --> 44:23.510
You know what?

44:23.553 --> 44:25.599
Let's take two, why don't we?

44:52.103 --> 44:54.367
Mr. Conlan.

44:56.847 --> 44:58.066
I know.

44:58.109 --> 45:00.329
Time for your daily fix.

45:01.896 --> 45:05.421
Shh.

45:05.465 --> 45:08.816
I know you don't
feel good, do you?

45:08.859 --> 45:10.209
Is that better?

45:12.080 --> 45:15.866
That's better.
Right?

45:19.566 --> 45:21.698
How would you like
to feel better...

45:21.742 --> 45:23.483
better than better,
Mr. Conlan?

45:25.136 --> 45:28.401
I'll give you an extra treat.

45:28.444 --> 45:31.708
How about we make you
feel nothing...

45:31.752 --> 45:34.407
at all?

45:34.450 --> 45:36.539
Molly Jenkins' bedpan is clean,

45:36.583 --> 45:38.193
and I'm hoping
it's because we changed it

45:38.237 --> 45:41.283
because if we...
What are you doing?

45:41.327 --> 45:43.416
Sadie, he only gets
4 milligrams.

45:43.459 --> 45:46.070
Right. Right.

45:46.114 --> 45:48.247
Right. Right. Duh.

45:48.290 --> 45:49.552
I'll go check on Molly.

45:49.596 --> 45:51.380
I'll go check on Molly.

45:51.424 --> 45:54.253
Sadie, give me the vial.

45:54.296 --> 45:56.298
Loosen up, Saggie. You need a cigarette.

45:56.342 --> 45:57.821
It's time for your break,
isn't it?

45:57.865 --> 45:59.301
I'll put the... dosage back myself.

45:59.345 --> 46:01.129
It's my ID code.

46:21.367 --> 46:22.672
Yeah?

46:22.716 --> 46:24.544
You were right.

46:24.587 --> 46:25.893
Sadie's not okay.

46:25.936 --> 46:27.547
Do tell.

46:27.590 --> 46:28.939
The amount of morphine
she just tried

46:28.983 --> 46:31.333
to pump into Ol' Conlan
could kill a rhinoceros.

46:31.377 --> 46:33.074
She's still got
one of the vials.

46:33.117 --> 46:34.554
Where are you?

46:34.597 --> 46:37.121
I'm downstairs.
I'm in the parking lot.

46:37.165 --> 46:38.079
Is she still on the floor?

46:38.122 --> 46:40.211
Not that I can tell.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.691
I'll meet you
at my spot in five.

46:41.735 --> 46:43.258
Great.

46:55.096 --> 46:57.664
Come to papa.

47:34.570 --> 47:37.225
Mow that bitch down, motherfucker!

47:45.451 --> 47:47.278
Pull up slowly into the parking bay

47:47.322 --> 47:49.368
and get out of the car...
slowly.

47:51.457 --> 47:53.328
Delighted to.

48:00.466 --> 48:02.076
That'll do.

48:02.119 --> 48:03.512
Step out of the car, please.

48:10.084 --> 48:11.172
What were you doing?

48:11.215 --> 48:12.869
I was on a... break.

48:12.913 --> 48:14.218
In the middle of the road?

48:14.262 --> 48:15.785
Yeah.
What do you do on yours?

48:15.829 --> 48:18.048
I don't take breaks.
I'm retired, as it happens.

48:18.092 --> 48:19.398
So, you're impersonating a...

48:19.441 --> 48:21.443
- police officer?
- I claim nothing.

48:21.487 --> 48:23.314
You flashed your gun at me.
No, I flashed nothing.

48:23.358 --> 48:24.881
Now, I need to see
in your car, okay?

48:24.925 --> 48:26.143
Why?
Because...

48:26.187 --> 48:27.536
Give me a fucking cigarette.

48:27.580 --> 48:29.364
Because I have a mind

48:29.408 --> 48:31.845
that you've stolen medicine
from this particular hospital,

48:31.888 --> 48:33.194
and I need to check it out, okay?

48:33.237 --> 48:34.543
What, are you high?

48:34.587 --> 48:36.589
Give me a fucking light.
I don't know you.

48:36.632 --> 48:38.547
Why the fuck would
I let you in my car?

48:38.591 --> 48:40.375
Okay.
I can get a warrant.

48:40.419 --> 48:42.856
You're retired!

48:42.899 --> 48:45.380
I have friends.

48:45.424 --> 48:47.034
Yeah?
I got a rape whistle.

48:49.036 --> 48:50.167
You have a what?

48:50.211 --> 48:51.430
A rape whistle!

48:53.606 --> 48:55.042
Yeah?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

48:55.085 --> 48:56.522
When I blow it,

48:56.565 --> 48:58.001
security's gonna blaze
around that corner,

48:58.045 --> 48:59.481
and I'm gonna tell them
you intended to rape me.

49:01.396 --> 49:02.876
It'll never hold up
in court, honey.

49:02.919 --> 49:05.487
Just has to make a lot of noise
in the here and now.

49:05.531 --> 49:07.446
Really?

49:07.489 --> 49:09.186
What are you doing with that?

49:11.624 --> 49:13.539
I told you I was gonna
fucking put it back.

49:25.376 --> 49:27.509
I've never seen her like that.

49:27.553 --> 49:31.905
First, you apply
for your fucking transfer,

49:31.948 --> 49:34.690
and now Fatty Hodges
is sniffing around.

49:34.734 --> 49:38.085
You know what you are, Sadie?
You're a fucking burden.

49:38.128 --> 49:41.871
Yeah.
You're a dead weight.

49:41.915 --> 49:43.830
That is not Sadie McDonald.

49:45.484 --> 49:48.791
All evidence to the contrary.

49:48.835 --> 49:51.620
Why would you let that guy
fucking close to us?

49:51.664 --> 49:53.535
Are you retarded?

49:53.579 --> 49:55.232
Are you retarded?!

49:55.276 --> 49:57.713
Fucking retarded, Sadie?

50:03.327 --> 50:04.807
She... She collects Hummels.

50:04.851 --> 50:07.157
She blogs about Furbies.
She loves Coldplay.

50:07.201 --> 50:09.159
Come on, Maggie.
Fuck's sake.

50:09.203 --> 50:10.465
Plenty of bad people blog.

50:10.509 --> 50:12.946
She's not a bad person, Bill.

50:12.989 --> 50:14.164
Well, who was that, then?

50:15.949 --> 50:18.429
You know what?

50:18.473 --> 50:20.257
Why don't we get some air?

50:22.172 --> 50:25.480
You might like that idea.

50:25.524 --> 50:29.136
You know... get out of here...

50:31.530 --> 50:33.619
feel the breeze on our faces.

50:35.272 --> 50:37.710
Do you like that, Sadie?

50:46.283 --> 50:47.850
Oh. Oh.

50:47.894 --> 50:49.852
Someone's angry.

50:49.896 --> 50:52.681
Lover's tiff?

50:52.725 --> 50:54.857
I thought... I thought, uh, love

50:54.901 --> 50:57.425
was supposed to make
the world go 'round.

50:57.468 --> 51:01.342
Is that your experience, Sadie?

51:14.398 --> 51:16.139
Did you make him happy?

51:16.183 --> 51:19.012
Did he make youhappy?

51:20.666 --> 51:23.799
No.

51:23.843 --> 51:26.715
Because you're not
fucking good enough, Sadie.

51:26.759 --> 51:28.674
You're not worth it.

51:28.717 --> 51:31.720
And why would you think
that would change...

51:31.764 --> 51:33.635
with anyone?

51:36.595 --> 51:39.075
Love isn't what
you thought it would be.

51:39.119 --> 51:40.990
Is it, Sadie?

51:44.603 --> 51:46.953
It's a lot to take.

51:46.996 --> 51:48.781
Could she be on something?

51:48.824 --> 51:51.435
No. No.
Huh?

51:51.479 --> 51:52.785
Sadie would never do drugs.

51:52.828 --> 51:53.960
She's a health-food nut.
She's...

51:54.003 --> 51:55.222
No, she wouldn't.

52:21.465 --> 52:23.990
It makes no sense.

52:26.035 --> 52:28.821
Love is a prison.

52:28.864 --> 52:30.953
Death...

52:32.738 --> 52:35.436
Death is liberation.

52:36.742 --> 52:38.178
Freedom.

52:39.788 --> 52:40.876
No more...

52:40.920 --> 52:43.009
pain.

52:44.663 --> 52:46.882
No more feeling.

52:46.926 --> 52:48.754
No more failure.

52:51.017 --> 52:52.975
Just freedom.
