WEBVTT

00:00.066 --> 00:01.500
Previously, on The Fosters...

00:01.529 --> 00:02.573
I founded this charter,

00:02.597 --> 00:04.530
and it was nearly turned
into luxury condos.

00:04.566 --> 00:06.532
I need to be given the
job that I've earned,

00:06.568 --> 00:08.368
principal of this school!

00:08.403 --> 00:11.137
All of you asked me out. I don't
see why I can't date all of you.

00:11.172 --> 00:12.249
- I'm cool with that.
- Yeah, I'm down.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.473
Great.

00:13.508 --> 00:15.419
We alter some of your cells,
then reinsert them into your body

00:15.443 --> 00:16.476
to attack the cancer.

00:16.511 --> 00:18.277
My friend, Ximena Sinfuego,

00:18.313 --> 00:20.213
has been living in a church

00:20.248 --> 00:21.492
because her DACA status is in question.

00:21.516 --> 00:23.483
ICE has already detained her parents.

00:23.518 --> 00:25.496
You're our new neighbors. Mom
went to high school with Tess.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
- What if I'm gay?
- Hi...

00:27.555 --> 00:30.590
You were blatantly flirting with
Tess in front of her husband.

00:37.265 --> 00:39.265
Congratulations, Principal!

00:39.300 --> 00:40.333
Oh.

00:40.368 --> 00:41.567
- We're so proud of you!
- _

00:41.636 --> 00:44.303
I love it. Thank you.

00:45.473 --> 00:46.539
Where's Jude?

00:46.574 --> 00:48.508
- Uh, he's in his bed, sick.
- Oh...

00:48.543 --> 00:50.276
- I'll go check on him.
- Okay.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.614
So, how do you feel?

00:54.649 --> 00:57.150
Oh, excited.

00:57.185 --> 00:58.618
A little nervous, honestly.

00:58.653 --> 01:01.120
Hey, who's gonna be
the vice principal now?

01:01.156 --> 01:04.090
Uh, I think I'm gonna wait until
the new school year to hire someone.

01:04.125 --> 01:05.391
Can you do both jobs yourself?

01:05.427 --> 01:07.160
It's gonna be a lot of work.

01:07.195 --> 01:08.539
Are you gonna have time to be my para?

01:08.563 --> 01:11.297
I will make time to be
in the classroom with you.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.344
Oh! You two need to get your
senior pictures and quotes

01:13.368 --> 01:15.179
into the yearbook, or
you're not gonna be in it.

01:15.203 --> 01:17.170
Do we have to do a quote?

01:17.205 --> 01:19.150
- Do we have to do it at all?
- Oh, my God!

01:19.174 --> 01:21.118
It's your senior year!
What's wrong with you guys?

01:21.142 --> 01:24.110
She's right, you have to do something
to celebrate your senior year.

01:25.180 --> 01:27.280
I already picked out my senior quote.

01:27.315 --> 01:29.348
"A girl who leaves
behind a trail of glitter

01:29.384 --> 01:30.583
is never forgotten."

01:32.287 --> 01:33.519
What?

01:33.555 --> 01:36.322
What about you, Mama? Did
you have a senior quote?

01:36.357 --> 01:40.193
Uh, "When you learn,
teach. When you get, give."

01:40.228 --> 01:42.295
Maya Angelou.

01:42.330 --> 01:45.331
Well, Jude has a fever, so
I think he should stay home.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.567
Mom, what was your senior quote?

01:47.602 --> 01:50.503
Oh, senior quote?
No... I don't remember.

01:50.538 --> 01:52.505
- Oh, come on, yes you do.
- What was it?

01:52.540 --> 01:55.241
"If you expect nothing from anybody,

01:55.276 --> 01:57.477
you will never be disappointed."
Sylvia Plath. Cheers.

01:57.512 --> 01:59.579
- Cool.
- That's bleak.

01:59.614 --> 02:01.481
It was the '90s.

02:01.516 --> 02:04.083
How are you feeling?

02:04.119 --> 02:05.485
I'm okay.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.465
Um, I made an appointment
with the therapist today.

02:07.489 --> 02:09.187
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

02:09.223 --> 02:10.523
Oh, my God!

02:10.558 --> 02:13.292
- What?
- They found our parents!

02:13.328 --> 02:16.529
Yeah, they're in a detention
center in Otay County.

02:16.564 --> 02:19.298
Otay Mesa. Yeah, that's
about 40 minutes from here.

02:19.334 --> 02:21.567
- When can you see them?
- Today!

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074

03:04.479 --> 03:07.213
You know, I'm surprised that
you don't have a socket wrench.

03:07.248 --> 03:09.081
You seem like such a handy guy.

03:09.117 --> 03:10.361
Lost one of my toolboxes in the move.

03:10.385 --> 03:12.185
Ah, I got you. Well, there you go.

03:12.220 --> 03:13.430
- Thank you, it's perfect.
- Absolutely.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.189
Um, are you still on for dinner tonight

03:16.224 --> 03:18.257
with Tess and your friend...

03:18.293 --> 03:19.492
Jana, is it?

03:19.527 --> 03:22.128
Jenna? Yeah, you know what?
I kind of forgot about that.

03:22.163 --> 03:23.362
Oh.

03:23.398 --> 03:25.364
- Um...
- If you can...

03:25.400 --> 03:28.301
can still make it, uh, do you think...

03:28.336 --> 03:30.236
Could you... I'm... I'm not asking you

03:30.271 --> 03:31.470
to report back or anything,

03:31.506 --> 03:34.106
but something's up with her.

03:34.142 --> 03:36.175
She won't tell me what it is, but...

03:36.211 --> 03:38.277
I think she could use
someone to talk to.

03:39.347 --> 03:41.414
Yeah, sure. No problem.

03:41.449 --> 03:43.149
I really appreciate it.

03:48.289 --> 03:50.489
I want to see your
work for each problem.

03:50.525 --> 03:52.124
All right?

03:53.461 --> 03:55.428
Ah, there she is, our new principal!

03:55.463 --> 03:57.363
Everyone!

03:57.398 --> 03:59.265
Thank you, thank you
very much. Just ignore me.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.067
I'm not here.

04:01.102 --> 04:02.368
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mom.

04:05.139 --> 04:07.073
Uh...

04:07.108 --> 04:09.208
as I was saying, I don't care...

04:09.244 --> 04:11.455
You might want to check that one.
It's A squared plus B squared,

04:11.479 --> 04:13.379
not 2A plus 2B.

04:13.414 --> 04:16.082
I... I care about how
you're finding the answer.

04:17.118 --> 04:19.418
Yeah, Mom, that's what I meant.

04:19.454 --> 04:22.188
So feel free to use
the back of the test...

04:23.258 --> 04:24.523
I, um...

04:24.559 --> 04:27.493
Just, please, put a corresponding number

04:27.528 --> 04:30.196
so I know which
question the work is for.

04:30.231 --> 04:32.164
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.401
Please keep your eyes, you
know, on your own paper.

04:38.339 --> 04:40.206
So, I got you a hearing.

04:40.241 --> 04:41.385
I don't think it would have happened

04:41.409 --> 04:43.320
without the press coverage
you got at the Shiloh event.

04:43.344 --> 04:44.410
Can I go?

04:45.513 --> 04:47.179
Unfortunately, no.

04:47.215 --> 04:49.548
They've been taking undocumented
people from courtrooms.

04:49.584 --> 04:51.450
It's too risky.

04:51.486 --> 04:53.519
What we need is any video you have

04:53.554 --> 04:55.599
of the speech Ximena gave at
the Shiloh protest on campus

04:55.623 --> 04:58.224
to prove she didn't make any
threats against the government.

04:58.259 --> 05:00.126
Yeah, I'm sure someone recorded it.

05:00.161 --> 05:02.428
Good, 'cause without it, I
think our chances are slim.

05:02.863 --> 05:06.365
So, if she gets a stay,
she can leave here?

05:06.401 --> 05:08.267
Yes, and they won't
be able to target her

05:08.303 --> 05:10.303
while her DACA status is being decided.

05:10.338 --> 05:11.470
Really?

05:11.506 --> 05:13.306
Can I go see my parents?

05:13.341 --> 05:15.207
You should be able to.

05:16.377 --> 05:18.177
I'm sorry you can't come today.

05:18.212 --> 05:21.080
It's okay, I'll tell them
how much you miss them.

05:21.115 --> 05:23.249
Tell them not to worry about me,

05:23.284 --> 05:24.517
and I love them.

05:24.552 --> 05:25.552
I will.

05:33.788 --> 05:38.624
It's supposed to be your senior
picture, not your passport photo.

05:38.659 --> 05:41.494
- Where'd you even take these?
- One of those mailbox places.

05:41.529 --> 05:45.431
Why don't you do something
memorable or funny?

05:45.466 --> 05:47.299
When I was a senior,

05:47.335 --> 05:49.435
we all went to
professional photographers

05:49.470 --> 05:51.504
and had our hair and makeup done.

05:51.539 --> 05:53.506
It was really a big deal.

05:53.541 --> 05:55.441
For our senior prank,

05:55.476 --> 05:57.243
we actually put the principal's car

05:57.278 --> 05:59.412
on the roof of the school.

05:59.447 --> 06:01.380
How?

06:01.416 --> 06:03.315
Well...

06:03.351 --> 06:05.584
Billy McRay's dad was in construction,

06:05.620 --> 06:08.120
so he loaned us a crane.

06:09.190 --> 06:11.323
I can't believe you did that.

06:11.359 --> 06:13.325
I used to be fun.

06:15.296 --> 06:17.229
Until you had a kid with cancer.

06:17.265 --> 06:19.532
No, Grace. Come on, no.

06:19.567 --> 06:23.436
Trust me, I stopped being
fun long before that.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.371
Mom, you don't have
to make me feel better.

06:25.406 --> 06:27.173
Grace.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.250
You know, I, uh, I don't
think there's ever been

06:29.251 --> 06:30.476
a senior prank at Anchor Beach.

06:30.511 --> 06:32.244
You should do one.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.546
I... I don't know if my mom

06:33.581 --> 06:35.347
would appreciate her car on the roof.

06:35.383 --> 06:38.451
Well, the principals
pretend like they're mad,

06:38.486 --> 06:41.287
but secretly, they love the attention.

06:41.322 --> 06:42.521
They do.

06:42.557 --> 06:44.323
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

06:44.358 --> 06:45.636
I'm not, like, a prank kind of guy.

06:45.660 --> 06:48.394
I can help you figure out an idea.

06:48.429 --> 06:51.230
You don't want your senior
year to be forgettable.

06:51.265 --> 06:53.199
Come on, it'll be so fun.

06:53.234 --> 06:55.234
Please? Please?

07:00.508 --> 07:02.575
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:02.610 --> 07:05.144
So, I e-mailed everyone.

07:05.179 --> 07:07.379
- And?
- No one recorded Ximena's speech.

07:07.415 --> 07:10.449
- Wait, no one?
- I know. It's crazy.

07:10.485 --> 07:12.351
I saw a guy with, like,

07:12.386 --> 07:14.386
a professional camera
filming everything that day.

07:14.422 --> 07:17.423
That guy was from the
Conservative Student Union.

07:17.458 --> 07:20.192
Okay, so we'll ask them for it.

07:21.295 --> 07:22.495
Come on.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.296
All right, let's go.

07:27.568 --> 07:29.568
Hey, why aren't you out there?

07:29.604 --> 07:32.438
Oh, uh, I can't scrimmage
until I make the team.

07:32.473 --> 07:33.617
I thought that you were on the team.

07:33.641 --> 07:37.343
Nope, still fresh meat
until tryouts in two weeks.

07:38.546 --> 07:41.347
Hey!

07:41.382 --> 07:42.548
Number 8 just fouled Poppy.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.416
Really, I didn't see that.

07:44.452 --> 07:47.186
I guess neither did the ref.

07:47.221 --> 07:49.221
Elbow in the back.

07:51.659 --> 07:53.425
- Hi.
- Hey!

07:54.495 --> 07:55.495
Where are you?

07:55.530 --> 07:57.630
Uh, derby practice
with Mariana and Poppy.

07:57.665 --> 07:59.532
I... I thought Poppy
was seeing her parents.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.500
Uh, she is, after.

08:01.536 --> 08:03.547
So, what happened to all
that homework you had to do?

08:03.571 --> 08:05.571
I'm doing it. I'm just gonna do it here.

08:05.606 --> 08:07.540
- That's not distracting?
- No.

08:07.575 --> 08:10.242
- Come on, get around her!
- Come on, blockers!

08:15.149 --> 08:16.248
There was four.

08:16.284 --> 08:19.218
Oi! She passed four blockers.

08:20.588 --> 08:22.588
Yeah, doesn't sound distracting at all.

08:22.623 --> 08:24.123
Nice.

08:24.158 --> 08:25.257
Uh, what?

08:25.293 --> 08:27.126
Yeah, just forget it. I gotta go.

08:27.161 --> 08:28.527
Wait, what is wrong?

08:28.563 --> 08:31.397
I just... I feel like I
don't get to see you anymore.

08:31.432 --> 08:33.465
Not alone.

08:33.501 --> 08:34.611
Want to go to a movie tonight?

08:34.635 --> 08:36.335
Can you? Are you sure?

08:36.370 --> 08:38.337
Yeah, I'm super sure.

08:38.371 --> 08:39.605
Okay.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.374
I'll, um... see what's
playing, and I'll text you.

08:42.409 --> 08:44.410
Okay, I love you.

08:44.445 --> 08:46.212
- Love you, too.
- Bye.

08:50.384 --> 08:52.585
Hey, is this right?

08:54.555 --> 08:56.322
Do you really want me to tell you?

08:56.357 --> 08:57.423
Yes.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.358
A triangle can't have two right angles.

09:03.531 --> 09:07.199
I used to be good at this,
I mean, kind of good at this.

09:07.235 --> 09:08.434
I suck at everything now.

09:08.469 --> 09:10.427
That's not true.

09:10.463 --> 09:13.197
I mean, you totally picked up
on the derby rules really fast,

09:13.232 --> 09:14.565
and they're really complicated.

09:17.270 --> 09:18.830
Hey, you know, we have a stats manager.

09:19.605 --> 09:21.305
What is that?

09:21.340 --> 09:24.508
He basically tracks all of the
jammer's lead percentages and stuff.

09:24.543 --> 09:27.511
Don't worry, there's not a
lot of math involved, but...

09:27.546 --> 09:29.413
you'd be really good at it.

09:33.452 --> 09:36.287
You blocked our guest
from speaking on campus.

09:36.322 --> 09:38.222
Why should we help you?

09:38.257 --> 09:39.468
'Cause it's the right thing to do.

09:39.492 --> 09:42.459
Our friend was exercising
her right to free speech.

09:42.495 --> 09:44.373
Yeah, a right you didn't
think Shiloh McCullen had.

09:44.397 --> 09:47.498
That wasn't about freedom
of speech in the world,

09:47.533 --> 09:49.600
just her right to spew
hate on our campus.

09:49.635 --> 09:51.368
There's no difference.

09:51.404 --> 09:53.404
Look, your own mission
statement says that

09:53.439 --> 09:56.607
if someone's rights are being
threatened, it is your responsibility

09:56.642 --> 09:59.343
to get together and
protect those rights.

09:59.378 --> 10:02.379
So, our friend is
being denied her rights

10:02.415 --> 10:05.549
because she criticized the government.

10:05.584 --> 10:08.352
Well, our mission statement
says, "When a citizen's

10:08.387 --> 10:10.154
rights are being threatened... "

10:11.190 --> 10:12.556
Your friend's illegal.

10:12.591 --> 10:14.491
People can't be illegal. Okay?

10:14.527 --> 10:16.193
And the Fourteenth Amendment says

10:16.228 --> 10:20.164
that the state can't deny any
person equal protection of the laws

10:20.199 --> 10:22.411
regardless of their nationality.
You should check it out.

10:22.435 --> 10:24.435
Yeah, well check this out.

10:24.470 --> 10:26.403
We own the footage,

10:26.439 --> 10:28.319
and we're under no
obligation to give it to you.

10:30.276 --> 10:32.443
Ximena's parents have been detained.

10:33.512 --> 10:35.446
Her 15-year-old sister

10:35.481 --> 10:37.381
has been moved into foster care.

10:37.416 --> 10:39.350
This is a real family

10:39.385 --> 10:41.218
that is being destroyed.

10:42.254 --> 10:43.620
And you can help.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.326
No?

10:49.362 --> 10:50.362
Nothing?

10:52.264 --> 10:53.464
Really? Okay.

11:00.806 --> 11:03.518
Hey, how was your first
day, Madame Principal?

11:03.542 --> 11:05.675
Oh, it went really well!

11:05.710 --> 11:07.677
- Good.
- Why are you in bed?

11:07.712 --> 11:10.647
Oh, I think... I think I got Jude's flu.

11:10.682 --> 11:12.449
Oh.

11:12.484 --> 11:13.817
What about therapy?

11:13.852 --> 11:15.452
I canceled it.

11:16.555 --> 11:18.855
I am not faking it, love.

11:18.890 --> 11:21.758
I swear I... I would
much rather go to therapy

11:21.793 --> 11:23.793
than this stupid dinner tonight.

11:23.829 --> 11:25.595
Well, you're not going if you're sick.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.630
Well, I have to because I promised Dean.

11:27.666 --> 11:30.433
- Dean?
- Yes, he's worried about Tess.

11:30.469 --> 11:32.402
He doesn't know what's
going on with her.

11:32.437 --> 11:34.871
Um, obviously she's
questioning her sexuality.

11:34.906 --> 11:36.906
Well, I can't tell him that, can I?

11:36.942 --> 11:39.542
And I'm certainly not gonna sit back

11:39.578 --> 11:42.412
and be a party to Jenna
breaking up their marriage.

11:42.447 --> 11:44.927
Well, honey, I don't want you
going and making yourself sicker.

11:45.851 --> 11:47.750
Okay, well, I won't...

11:48.854 --> 11:50.787
as long as you go in my place.

12:00.465 --> 12:01.764
Where'd you get that?

12:01.800 --> 12:06.603
Um, Sean checked it out from
the UCSD film department.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.405
Since we can't get
video of Ximena's speech,

12:09.441 --> 12:11.508
and she can't go to her hearing,

12:11.543 --> 12:14.711
I'm going to shoot her
statement for the judge.

12:14.746 --> 12:16.646
Hopefully he'll watch it.

12:16.681 --> 12:18.448
She has a right to defend herself.

12:19.818 --> 12:21.751
- What are you doing?
- Hi.

12:21.786 --> 12:24.554
Um, so, have you guys heard of anyone

12:24.589 --> 12:26.723
doing, like, a senior prank?

12:26.758 --> 12:28.691
Um, no, I'm not exactly

12:28.727 --> 12:31.528
keyed into the secret
goings on at Anchor Beach.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.597
I am, and I haven't heard anything.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.466
Yeah, why do you care?

12:36.501 --> 12:38.468
Uh, Grace wants me to do one.

12:38.503 --> 12:39.702
Why does Grace care?

12:39.738 --> 12:42.872
Well, she was home-schooled
so she missed out on a lot,

12:42.908 --> 12:44.607
like prom, and I just think

12:44.643 --> 12:47.443
it would mean a lot
for her if I did this.

12:47.479 --> 12:50.513
And you know, if you
guys maybe participated?

12:50.549 --> 12:52.849
And... and got your
friends to help, too.

12:55.453 --> 12:58.421
Um, when exactly is this happening?

12:58.456 --> 12:59.889
Tonight.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.624
Tonight?

13:15.674 --> 13:18.408
Hey, how'd it go with your parents?

13:21.479 --> 13:22.812
Um...

13:22.847 --> 13:24.747
what... what's wrong?

13:30.455 --> 13:33.656
"Watch out, sweetheart,
'cause I had plans."

13:33.692 --> 13:35.658
Seriously.

13:35.694 --> 13:37.694
Hey, sorry, I'm late. Traffic.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.429
Oh! I did not know

13:39.464 --> 13:40.863
- that you were joining us.
- Yeah.

13:40.899 --> 13:44.400
Uh, yeah, actually, Stef is
sick, so it's just gonna be me.

13:44.436 --> 13:45.802
Oh...

13:45.837 --> 13:47.837
Afraid to show her face.

13:47.872 --> 13:49.405
What?

13:49.441 --> 13:51.441
We had a little, uh, tiff...

13:51.476 --> 13:52.809
the other night after you left.

13:52.844 --> 13:54.811
Oh. What about?

13:54.846 --> 13:57.513
- Well...
- She was just tired

13:57.549 --> 13:59.849
and she wanted to get to bed, so.

13:59.884 --> 14:02.418
Mm-hmm.

14:02.454 --> 14:03.753
Well, you can tell her

14:03.788 --> 14:05.822
that she can apologize anytime.

14:06.891 --> 14:08.691
- Can I get you a drink?
- _

14:08.727 --> 14:10.793
Oh, yes, I'm ready
for another one. Tess?

14:10.829 --> 14:12.595
Sure, why not?

14:12.631 --> 14:14.597
- It's girls' night out.
- Yes, it is.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.433
Um, I'll just have a white wine,

14:17.469 --> 14:18.501
any kind is fine.

14:18.536 --> 14:20.503
Um, skinny margarita for me.

14:20.538 --> 14:22.405
Skinny margarita?

14:22.440 --> 14:25.508
Oh, come on, you do not
need to be counting calories.

14:25.543 --> 14:27.644
Your bod is smokin' hot.

14:27.679 --> 14:29.646
On second thought, I'll have a martini.

14:29.681 --> 14:31.514
- Well, you...
- Facts are facts.

14:31.549 --> 14:32.615
Thank you very much.

14:36.655 --> 14:38.488
Hi.

14:38.523 --> 14:40.723
You look really, really pretty.

14:40.759 --> 14:42.759
Uh... thanks.

14:44.462 --> 14:45.462
Oh.

14:47.499 --> 14:48.765
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.834
You know how Poppy was supposed
to see her parents today?

14:51.870 --> 14:53.436
Mm-hmm.

14:53.471 --> 14:55.538
Well, when she got there,
she found out that they

14:55.573 --> 14:58.541
actually moved them to a
detention center in Arizona.

14:58.576 --> 15:00.510
She's, like, really upset about it,

15:00.545 --> 15:03.413
and everyone else is either
sick or out of the house,

15:03.448 --> 15:05.615
and I just don't feel okay
with leaving her here alone,

15:05.650 --> 15:07.650
so do you think I could just tell her

15:07.686 --> 15:10.353
that we were gonna stay
in and watch a movie?

15:10.388 --> 15:12.588
Popcorn's ready!

15:12.624 --> 15:15.425
Oh. Hey, Emma.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.694
I might have already told her that, so.

15:17.729 --> 15:20.697
Um, were you guys going out tonight?

15:20.732 --> 15:22.498
No!

15:22.534 --> 15:23.766
N... no.

15:23.802 --> 15:25.435
Are you sure?

15:25.470 --> 15:27.670
'Cause I can go upstairs
if you want to be alone.

15:27.706 --> 15:29.572
No. No, no. We don't wanna be alone.

15:29.607 --> 15:31.407
We wanna be with you, right?

15:32.477 --> 15:33.810
Totally.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.778
Okay. Well...

15:35.814 --> 15:37.647
have you ever seen Whip It?

15:37.682 --> 15:38.848
- No.
- Mm-mm.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.550
It's about roller derby,

15:40.585 --> 15:42.685
and as our new stats manager,

15:42.721 --> 15:44.554
it's kind of a must-see.

15:44.589 --> 15:46.489
Mm?

15:46.524 --> 15:47.557
Stats manager?

15:47.592 --> 15:49.859
Yeah. They... they asked me
to help out with the team.

15:49.894 --> 15:53.563
Yeah, he learned the rules
in, like, record time.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.398
He's amazing.

15:59.604 --> 16:00.770
After you.

16:12.550 --> 16:13.683
Hey.

16:13.718 --> 16:15.685
Hey. Hi... Mat.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.620
Hey. Uh, I'll be right back.

16:17.655 --> 16:19.522
Gotta run to my locker.

16:19.557 --> 16:21.524
Wait, I didn't know
you were bringing Mat.

16:21.559 --> 16:23.459
Uh, he's a senior. Why?

16:25.263 --> 16:26.273
I didn't know that many people

16:26.274 --> 16:28.423
who would be interested
in doing this, okay?

16:30.735 --> 16:33.436
I didn't know juniors were
participating in the senior prank.

16:35.473 --> 16:37.440
Oh, you're his plus-one.

16:39.611 --> 16:41.477
Hey, you came! Awesome.

16:41.513 --> 16:44.380
Come on, Brandon Foster
doing a senior prank?

16:44.416 --> 16:46.382
Couldn't miss it.

16:46.418 --> 16:47.617
So...

16:47.652 --> 16:48.652
is this back on?

16:49.687 --> 16:51.754
No, not like back on.

16:51.790 --> 16:53.790
"On" like... a little.

16:56.594 --> 16:57.794
So...

16:57.829 --> 16:59.495
guess who has two thumbs

16:59.531 --> 17:02.498
and access to a whole
orchestra of crickets?

17:02.534 --> 17:04.400
Uh, no, no crickets.

17:04.435 --> 17:07.470
Nothing live or too messy.

17:07.505 --> 17:09.338
I can't believe you're doing this.

17:09.374 --> 17:10.573
Hi, Talia.

17:13.811 --> 17:15.545
So, what are we doing, Brandon?

17:15.579 --> 17:17.814
Uh, well, this is my girlfriend, Grace,

17:17.848 --> 17:20.383
and, uh, do you wanna just...

17:20.417 --> 17:21.784
Yeah, we're gonna bring the beach

17:21.819 --> 17:23.752
inside Anchor Beach.

17:23.788 --> 17:24.788
- That's cool.
- Okay.

17:24.789 --> 17:26.689
That doesn't sound messy at all.

17:26.723 --> 17:29.425
Well, that's why we have...

17:29.461 --> 17:30.827
these tarps...

17:30.862 --> 17:33.596
to help contain all the sand.

17:33.631 --> 17:35.364
Contain sand?

17:35.400 --> 17:38.367
Yeah, so everybody, we have
a bunch of stuff in the car,

17:38.403 --> 17:41.471
and we have to fill this place up
with sand as much as possible, so...

17:41.506 --> 17:42.638
On the tarps.

17:44.576 --> 17:45.741
Does she even go here?

17:50.548 --> 17:52.715
Um, I'm sorry Wyatt's here.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.584
I didn't invite him.

17:54.619 --> 17:56.586
Why are you doing this?

17:56.621 --> 17:59.422
The prank? It looks fun, and
you know I have serious FOMO.

17:59.457 --> 18:01.557
No, dating all these guys?

18:03.361 --> 18:06.429
Look, I know you're scared of
getting hurt again, I get that.

18:06.464 --> 18:08.664
And I'm totally cool
with taking it slow,

18:08.700 --> 18:09.732
but...

18:11.769 --> 18:13.781
if you don't know in your heart
we're meant to be together,

18:13.805 --> 18:15.705
then why are we doing this at all?

18:26.194 --> 18:28.094
Should I break up with Wyatt?

18:28.130 --> 18:30.029
Is there even anything to break up?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.531
You know what I mean?

18:31.566 --> 18:32.911
Mat things I'm using all of these guys

18:32.912 --> 18:34.112
as an excuse to not get back with him,

18:34.136 --> 18:36.136
because I'm afraid he's
gonna break my heart again.

18:36.171 --> 18:38.104
What do you think?

18:38.140 --> 18:42.041
I don't know. I mean, did I
ever really give Wyatt a chance?

18:42.077 --> 18:43.443
He's been so sweet.

18:43.478 --> 18:46.379
I mean, come on, that calendar.

18:46.414 --> 18:48.414
And Logan,

18:48.450 --> 18:51.284
he's so nice, and he's a great kisser.

18:51.319 --> 18:53.186
You're kissing all these guys?

18:53.221 --> 18:55.021
Yeah, but I'm just kissing.

18:56.158 --> 18:57.223
Anyway,

18:57.259 --> 18:59.025
Mat's my first love.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.094
And he's leaving for college soon.

19:01.129 --> 19:02.262
True.

19:04.399 --> 19:06.966
Yeah, but if we're meant to be,

19:07.002 --> 19:09.002
we can survive a
long-distance relationship.

19:09.037 --> 19:10.203
- Right?
- I...

19:10.238 --> 19:11.971
And if we're really meant to be,

19:12.007 --> 19:13.217
why am I wasting all of this time?

19:13.241 --> 19:15.275
- Are you...
- You know what? You're right.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.076
I should end it with Wyatt and Logan,

19:17.112 --> 19:18.411
and just go for it.

19:18.446 --> 19:20.046
Thanks for the advice.

19:22.317 --> 19:23.349
Yeah.

19:28.290 --> 19:29.422
Wyatt!

19:29.457 --> 19:31.191
Come on, you're getting sand everywhere.

19:31.226 --> 19:33.159
There is sand everywhere.

19:33.195 --> 19:35.261
You're tight as ever, B. Here.

19:35.297 --> 19:37.063
Wha...

19:37.098 --> 19:39.098
Yeah, that's... that's actually nice.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.134
Thank you.

19:41.469 --> 19:44.304
Uh, are you sure we need more sand?

19:44.339 --> 19:47.006
Yeah. You gotta be able
to dig your feet in.

19:48.210 --> 19:50.376
- So, what's the deal with that girl?
- What girl?

19:50.412 --> 19:52.212
The one that was just massaging you.

19:52.247 --> 19:54.347
Oh, Talia? Oh, there's no deal.

19:54.382 --> 19:56.182
We just, uh...

19:56.218 --> 19:58.184
we dated for a while.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.486
Oh. How long?

20:00.522 --> 20:03.056
Uh... freshman year,

20:03.091 --> 20:05.158
and... and sophomore year.

20:05.193 --> 20:06.426
Wow, two years.

20:06.461 --> 20:08.228
And a little bit of junior year, too.

20:08.263 --> 20:11.130
So... was she, like, your first?

20:12.267 --> 20:14.200
Um...

20:20.004 --> 20:22.400
_

20:29.101 --> 20:34.705
_

20:37.092 --> 20:39.225
- Who have you been texting the entire night?
- Yeah!

20:39.261 --> 20:42.095
Oh, I'm just checking in on Stef.

20:42.130 --> 20:43.229
Well, you should, um,

20:43.265 --> 20:46.099
probably just go home and
take care of your wife.

20:46.134 --> 20:48.468
Yeah, please don't feel
like you need to stay.

20:48.503 --> 20:50.103
Please.

20:50.138 --> 20:51.549
- She's... Oh, oh.
- Here you go.

20:51.573 --> 20:53.539
- Great, thank you.
- Yay!

20:53.575 --> 20:55.375
That would be me.

20:55.410 --> 20:57.443
I'm the skinny margarita.

20:57.479 --> 20:59.445
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:59.481 --> 21:02.415
So, marriage, right? It is not easy.

21:02.450 --> 21:05.285
Right? Cheers to that.

21:05.320 --> 21:09.355
I know, Lena. It is certainly not easy.

21:11.259 --> 21:13.426
Especially when your wife cheats on you.

21:13.461 --> 21:15.161
- What?
- Yeah.

21:15.196 --> 21:17.096
My ex-wife

21:17.132 --> 21:19.299
joined a band at 40,

21:19.334 --> 21:22.101
and started banging the lead singer...

21:22.137 --> 21:24.070
- No!
- ... who was...

21:24.105 --> 21:25.204
25.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.341
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry.

21:28.376 --> 21:31.477
Thank you, thank you. The truth is...

21:31.513 --> 21:34.314
we weren't happy,

21:34.349 --> 21:37.050
and we should have just
walked away as friends,

21:37.085 --> 21:40.486
instead of waiting til one
of us really hurt the other.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.424
That is a good point.

21:44.459 --> 21:46.392
Or, you know, you should just...

21:46.428 --> 21:48.294
work through it.

21:48.330 --> 21:50.196
You know? Because all couples,

21:50.231 --> 21:52.065
they go through their ups and downs.

21:52.100 --> 21:55.168
Right? And you always think the
grass is greener on the other side.

21:55.203 --> 21:58.338
But it's not at all...

21:58.373 --> 22:00.139
greener.

22:00.175 --> 22:02.286
And then you've gone and
you've blown up your marriage,

22:02.310 --> 22:05.111
and... and... and, you
know, it's hard on the kids.

22:05.146 --> 22:06.479
So, my kid's doing just fine.

22:06.514 --> 22:10.149
And staying in an unhappy marriage

22:10.185 --> 22:11.484
isn't good for them either.

22:11.519 --> 22:14.120
Although, you know, studies show that

22:14.155 --> 22:17.190
kids from broken homes,
they... they suffer.

22:17.225 --> 22:19.058
They suffer.

22:19.094 --> 22:20.460
Uh-huh.

22:23.098 --> 22:25.064
Is it Stef again?

22:25.100 --> 22:26.265
Uh, no,

22:26.301 --> 22:28.468
it's the security company
that patrols the school.

22:28.503 --> 22:30.336
Somebody left all the lights on.

22:30.372 --> 22:32.305
- Wow.
- Wow.

22:32.340 --> 22:36.042
So, you... you should
probably go and check on that.

22:41.082 --> 22:42.348
So, some people think

22:42.384 --> 22:44.484
that Ellen Page is too small

22:44.519 --> 22:46.285
to be taken seriously as a derby girl,

22:46.321 --> 22:48.221
but it's, like, look at me and Mariana.

22:48.256 --> 22:50.356
We're small, and we kick ass.

22:50.392 --> 22:53.259
Whoa, wait. They just all stopped
and knocked the other team down.

22:53.294 --> 22:55.061
You don't really do that, do you?

22:55.096 --> 22:56.329
Mm-mm. No, no, no.

22:56.364 --> 22:58.097
In real life, they'd all be ejected.

22:58.133 --> 22:59.465
Can we not talk during the movie?

23:01.403 --> 23:03.236
I'm sorry.

23:12.113 --> 23:13.446
Hey. Can I talk to you?

23:13.481 --> 23:15.448
Aloha.

23:15.483 --> 23:17.083
Aloha!

23:17.118 --> 23:19.118
Hey, eyes are up here.

23:19.154 --> 23:21.254
Oh, sorry, your...

23:21.289 --> 23:23.423
your bra was distracting.

23:23.458 --> 23:26.092
Think I might wear it
for my senior picture.

23:26.127 --> 23:28.127
Oh, yeah, you need to get that in,

23:28.163 --> 23:30.129
along with your quote, this week.

23:30.165 --> 23:33.099
"There are far, far better things ahead

23:33.134 --> 23:36.035
than any we leave behind."

23:36.070 --> 23:37.136
C.S. Lewis.

23:37.172 --> 23:38.471
I love that.

23:38.506 --> 23:42.108
Do you know that 70% of
the world is unexplored?

23:42.143 --> 23:43.242
No.

23:43.278 --> 23:45.111
It's exciting to think about, isn't it?

23:45.146 --> 23:46.412
It is.

23:47.482 --> 23:49.482
I'd like to explore it with you.

23:52.353 --> 23:54.320
So, what do you think of Talia?

23:54.355 --> 23:57.089
- Talia?
- Yeah.

23:57.125 --> 24:00.059
She is a mixed bag.

24:00.094 --> 24:02.428
Yeah, I found out she's Brandon's first.

24:02.464 --> 24:04.297
It's just so awkward
being in the same room

24:04.332 --> 24:06.199
with someone that slept
with your boyfriend.

24:08.036 --> 24:10.069
Mind if I hang with you?

24:10.104 --> 24:12.004
No.

24:15.076 --> 24:17.376
Okay, you know what, guys?
I think we have enough sand.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.445
Thank you... for that.

24:19.481 --> 24:22.215
Come on, you know
that's a waste of time.

24:22.250 --> 24:25.017
Yeah, I know, I'm just
trying to minimize the mess.

24:25.053 --> 24:28.154
Who'd have thunk you and I'd
be involved in a senior prank?

24:28.189 --> 24:31.357
I'm kind of sad this is all gonna
be over in a couple of months.

24:31.392 --> 24:33.493
Yeah, but you gotta be
excited about Berklee, right?

24:33.528 --> 24:36.128
Yeah. I mean, whatever.

24:36.164 --> 24:39.165
You don't have to downplay it just
'cause I blew it with Julliard.

24:39.200 --> 24:45.104
No, I'm not. I guess I'm just
kind of nervous about... moving on.

24:45.139 --> 24:48.307
Everyone's so over high school,

24:48.343 --> 24:50.443
but what if this is as good as it gets?

24:52.213 --> 24:54.480
What is these are, like,
the best years of our lives?

24:58.286 --> 25:00.386
Hey, guys, let's try to
keep it off the ground.

25:00.421 --> 25:02.421
Okay.

25:08.029 --> 25:09.029
Oh!

25:10.098 --> 25:12.331
Come on! Have some fun, please?

25:12.367 --> 25:14.300
Come on, Brandon!

25:25.046 --> 25:26.457
- We have to go!
- Go, go, go!

25:26.481 --> 25:28.180
What the hell is this?

25:40.495 --> 25:42.740
I don't think she really liked it.

25:42.759 --> 25:45.626
She's just... she's just tired.

25:45.661 --> 25:47.428
Well, thanks...

25:47.463 --> 25:49.630
for staying in with me.

25:49.665 --> 25:53.267
I know you guys were supposed
to go out tonight and...

25:53.302 --> 25:54.702
I just hope she's not mad.

25:54.737 --> 25:57.571
No, she's... she's not. She's good.

25:59.575 --> 26:01.475
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.453
- Hello.
- Mmm.

26:13.689 --> 26:15.422
Is it over?

26:15.458 --> 26:17.258
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

26:18.728 --> 26:20.427
I should get home.

26:20.463 --> 26:22.363
Wait, you don't wanna...

26:22.398 --> 26:24.231
make out for a little while?

26:26.769 --> 26:28.235
No.

26:28.271 --> 26:30.571
Well... I... Hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, come on.

26:30.606 --> 26:33.707
Look, I'm sorry about tonight.

26:33.743 --> 26:36.310
Hey, don't be mad, please?

26:36.345 --> 26:38.379
I'm not mad about tonight.

26:38.414 --> 26:39.691
I'm mad that you don't have time for me,

26:39.715 --> 26:41.582
but you have time to be
a roller derby manager.

26:41.617 --> 26:44.385
I don't have time to be
a roller derby manager.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.420
Then why are you doing it?

26:46.455 --> 26:50.257
Because I... I gotta feel
like I'm good at something.

26:50.293 --> 26:51.559
You're good at lots of things.

26:51.594 --> 26:54.528
No, I was good at wrestling, Emma,

26:54.564 --> 26:57.298
but I can't do that anymore,
and I was never good at school.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.400
And now, I'm even worse at that.

26:59.435 --> 27:03.504
I just... I need something
to be fun and easy.

27:06.609 --> 27:08.475
I'm easy.

27:08.511 --> 27:11.245
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.616
You can't be the only thing
in my life that makes me happy.

27:18.688 --> 27:20.528
If you don't want me to
do it though, then I...

27:20.556 --> 27:22.389
No, I...

27:23.492 --> 27:26.293
I want you to do it.

27:26.329 --> 27:28.262
I just...

27:28.297 --> 27:31.365
I feel like since Poppy
moved in with you and Mariana,

27:31.400 --> 27:33.634
sometimes I just feel like...

27:33.669 --> 27:36.237
a third wheel.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.641
Girl, you are my only wheel.

27:41.711 --> 27:43.544
I'm talking both axles.

27:43.579 --> 27:46.247
My drive shaft. I mean,
you are the windows

27:46.282 --> 27:47.659
- that go up and down automatically.
- Okay.

27:47.683 --> 27:49.550
Okay, Foster, I get it.

27:51.487 --> 27:53.454
I will make more time for you.

27:53.489 --> 27:54.688
I promise.

27:58.327 --> 27:59.660
I think we're alone right now,

27:59.695 --> 28:01.595
actually.

28:01.631 --> 28:03.497
- Yes.
- Mmm?

28:03.532 --> 28:05.232
Yes, we are.

28:08.237 --> 28:10.404
I told them it was
incredibly disrespectful.

28:10.439 --> 28:14.208
My first day on the job and they...
my own kids break into the school,

28:14.243 --> 28:16.277
and build a beach in the hallways?

28:16.312 --> 28:18.657
- I know that you're upset...
- It's not enough that I wasted my night

28:18.681 --> 28:20.547
trying to cock-block Jenna,

28:20.583 --> 28:23.284
which I'm never doing again, by the way.

28:23.319 --> 28:25.686
If Tess wants to explore her sexuality,

28:25.721 --> 28:28.289
it is none of our business.

28:28.324 --> 28:30.457
Wait, Tess was flirting with Jenna?

28:30.493 --> 28:31.625
- Yes.
- Oh, my...

28:31.661 --> 28:33.627
I... I don't know. I don't know.

28:33.663 --> 28:36.363
I don't care, and neither should you.

28:36.399 --> 28:39.466
I still can't believe that
Brandon organized a senior prank.

28:39.502 --> 28:41.468
Yeah, with our own
daughters as accomplices.

28:41.504 --> 28:44.705
Clearly they have no respect
for me or my position.

28:44.740 --> 28:47.641
And if they don't, how can I
expect the other students to?

28:47.677 --> 28:50.411
People think I got the
job by default as it is.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.415
Well, maybe one way to get some respect

28:54.450 --> 28:57.251
is to show that you
have a sense of humor.

28:57.286 --> 28:59.665
All right, so I'm just doing a
horrible job all the way around.

28:59.689 --> 29:02.256
Thank you for the support, thank you.

29:05.628 --> 29:07.528
How many martinis did you have?

29:07.563 --> 29:09.463
- Stop talking.
- Uh-huh.

29:23.612 --> 29:25.412
I'm... sorry.

29:25.448 --> 29:28.215
It's not your fault.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.494
I just... I thought it
would be good for you

29:29.518 --> 29:31.518
to do something fun
for your senior year.

29:31.554 --> 29:33.687
I said it's not your fault, okay?

29:33.723 --> 29:35.422
I shouldn't have done it.

29:36.492 --> 29:38.559
Then why did you?

29:38.594 --> 29:41.295
For me, because you think
I'm missing out on so much?

29:43.399 --> 29:46.433
That's the problem, Brandon, you're
doing everything for me right now,

29:46.469 --> 29:48.235
and nothing for yourself.

29:48.270 --> 29:51.338
I don't want you to miss
out on things because of me.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.474
I need to know that you're
taking care of yourself.

29:53.509 --> 29:57.311
I don't feel like I'm
missing out on anything, okay?

29:57.346 --> 29:59.713
I'm exactly where I want to be,

29:59.749 --> 30:02.416
with the girl I love.

30:02.451 --> 30:05.552
And I need you to not
feel guilty about that.

30:09.425 --> 30:11.392
Okay, fine.

30:11.427 --> 30:13.460
Let's make a deal.

30:13.496 --> 30:16.296
I won't feel guilty if...

30:16.332 --> 30:18.632
you stop treating me
like a Make-A-Wish kid

30:18.667 --> 30:21.368
whose every dream you
need to make come true.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.406
Okay.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.608
But we still have to do the gig,

30:27.643 --> 30:29.676
so you have to make good on that one.

30:29.712 --> 30:31.412
I will.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.491
So, my T-cells are back.

30:44.527 --> 30:46.727
Oh, uh, okay. What does that mean?

30:46.762 --> 30:51.465
It means I won't be able
to see you for a few days.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.767
I have to...

30:53.803 --> 30:56.670
be totally healthy when
they put the cells back in.

30:56.705 --> 30:59.506
So... tonight was...

30:59.542 --> 31:01.508
the last night out for me for a while.

31:04.580 --> 31:07.414
Okay. Um...

31:07.450 --> 31:09.583
I mean, this... this
is a good thing, right?

31:09.618 --> 31:12.586
You know, the sooner you do this,

31:12.621 --> 31:15.289
the sooner you'll get better.

31:16.592 --> 31:18.692
Yeah, I mean, we don't know if it...

31:18.727 --> 31:21.295
if it's actually gonna work.

31:21.330 --> 31:23.497
Really don't.

31:23.532 --> 31:24.532
I do.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.710
How much trouble do you
think we're gonna be in?

31:36.745 --> 31:39.513
- Do you think she saw me?
- Yes, Mariana.

31:39.548 --> 31:42.516
I think that before you ran
like a coward, she saw you.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.519
Your Honor,

31:45.554 --> 31:46.731
I regret not being able to attend today,

31:46.755 --> 31:49.356
to appeal to you in person,

31:49.391 --> 31:51.391
but my friend is helping me make this

31:51.427 --> 31:53.472
- so I could explain the situation.
- Is that Ximena's statement?

31:53.496 --> 31:55.362
- How'd she do?
- Great.

31:55.397 --> 31:58.599
Except without the footage,
it's her word against ICE.

31:58.634 --> 32:00.667
Can't the university make CS...

32:00.703 --> 32:02.543
whatever their name is...
give you the footage?

32:02.571 --> 32:04.505
The Conservative Student Union?

32:04.540 --> 32:07.274
No, I don't think so.

32:07.309 --> 32:08.542
Without it, I'm worried

32:08.577 --> 32:10.544
that she won't even get her DACA.

32:10.579 --> 32:12.379
Then what would happen?

32:13.716 --> 32:17.317
She never leaves the
church, or she gets detained.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.719
Probably deported.

32:18.754 --> 32:22.356
And I would never betray
my parents' sacrifices by...

32:23.492 --> 32:25.292
Wait...

32:27.496 --> 32:29.263
This looks like the camera

32:29.298 --> 32:31.532
that the CSU used to shoot the protest.

32:41.777 --> 32:43.510
What?

32:53.839 --> 32:55.605
Wh... Damn!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.407
How'd they all find out?

32:57.442 --> 33:00.477
I figured a little shout out to
the student body was in order.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.580
Well, great, this is only
gonna make Mama even madder.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.416
Especially when she sees that!

33:06.451 --> 33:07.717
We gotta get rid of that!

33:07.753 --> 33:10.453
Good morning, seniors!

33:10.489 --> 33:12.555
How's the surf today?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.593
- Yeah!
- Woo!

33:17.863 --> 33:20.764
Ready for the beach, Ms. Foster?

33:20.799 --> 33:22.565
By the way,

33:22.601 --> 33:24.768
this better all be cleaned
up by the end of the day.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.703
If I find one grain of sand,

33:26.738 --> 33:29.372
I'm going to make a
beach in all of your beds.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.575
All right!

33:35.414 --> 33:37.480
- It's not my problem.
- What?

33:37.516 --> 33:40.516
- Yes, it is. It's our problem. It's our problem.
- Your last name's Foster.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.467
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:57.502 --> 33:59.869
- Um, can I come in?
- Sure.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.807
Yeah, I heard you weren't feeling well,

34:03.875 --> 34:06.643
so, I thought I'd pop
over and make a house call.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.610
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.715
Um...

34:12.751 --> 34:15.585
Listen, I know we never talked

34:15.620 --> 34:17.353
about what I said to you at prom.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.389
What are you doing, Tess?

34:19.424 --> 34:20.790
What do you mean?

34:20.826 --> 34:23.393
With Jenna? Flirting with her

34:23.428 --> 34:25.668
in front of your husband, in
front of my wife last night.

34:26.797 --> 34:29.466
Dean has no idea
what's going on with you

34:29.501 --> 34:32.402
to the point that he's
asking me if I know anything,

34:32.437 --> 34:34.404
and I don't know what to say to him.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.706
And even if I did,

34:37.742 --> 34:40.376
it is not my business to.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.746
You need to be honest
with yourself, Tess,

34:43.782 --> 34:45.482
and with your husband...

34:47.485 --> 34:49.385
or things...

34:49.420 --> 34:51.554
are gonna get really messy.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.529
Okay. Um, well, I hope you feel better.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.544
So...

35:15.647 --> 35:18.414
I decided to call things off with Wyatt.

35:19.684 --> 35:20.750
Okay.

35:20.785 --> 35:24.387
But... then I changed my mind.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.756
Because I think the person

35:26.791 --> 35:29.425
that I need to end things with...

35:30.595 --> 35:31.794
is you.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.832
Okay.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.669
It's not because I don't love you.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.773
But I wanna look forward,

35:43.808 --> 35:45.742
and I feel like you're looking back...

35:47.779 --> 35:50.680
holding on to what's
familiar, like high school,

35:50.715 --> 35:52.782
and me.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.852
And I'm excited to see what's next,

35:55.887 --> 35:59.389
not go back to what was, and...

36:02.627 --> 36:06.362
I think you should be
really excited about Boston.

36:08.366 --> 36:10.366
Don't be scared.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.737
You're gonna have great adventures,

36:14.773 --> 36:17.574
and you're gonna do amazing things.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.378
I promise you...

36:22.414 --> 36:25.548
the best years of our
lives are not behind us.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.698
... where a student's humanity
should not be challenged

36:41.733 --> 36:45.368
as some excuse for freedom of speech.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.637
Racism should not be allowed

36:47.672 --> 36:49.572
in academic platforms!

36:49.608 --> 36:51.407
Build a wall...

36:51.443 --> 36:53.776
Okay, after viewing this video,

36:53.812 --> 36:55.745
I see nothing in what the defendant said

36:55.780 --> 36:57.714
that sounds even remotely

36:57.749 --> 37:00.383
like a threat to the
security of the United States.

37:00.418 --> 37:03.686
Therefore I am granting
a stay of deportation

37:03.722 --> 37:08.324
until Ms. Sinfuego's
DACA status is decided.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.313
Hey.

37:25.349 --> 37:27.249
Hi.

37:27.284 --> 37:29.351
I know you can't open the door,

37:29.386 --> 37:32.087
but I have something for you,

37:32.122 --> 37:33.989
so I'll just leave it here.

37:36.093 --> 37:39.261
And, uh... and I
sterilized it for you, too.

37:39.296 --> 37:41.062
Okay.

37:44.134 --> 37:46.201
I love you.

37:46.236 --> 37:48.203
I love you, too.

38:16.065 --> 38:17.935
_

38:36.119 --> 38:37.319
He's a good one.

38:39.423 --> 38:40.989
I know.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.300
Pastor Nicole,

38:52.336 --> 38:54.302
all of you,

38:54.338 --> 38:57.038
I can never thank you enough for
everything you've done for me.

38:57.074 --> 38:58.602
You are always welcome here

38:58.603 --> 39:01.142
and we will be praying
for you and your family.

39:01.178 --> 39:02.977
Do you know where you're going?

39:04.147 --> 39:06.948
Stef and Lena said that
I could live with them

39:06.983 --> 39:09.184
until my DACA status is approved

39:09.219 --> 39:11.286
and I can be Poppy's legal guardian.

39:11.321 --> 39:13.121
That is so lovely of you.

39:13.156 --> 39:15.190
We're happy to have her.

39:15.225 --> 39:17.158
There are some people and press outside.

39:17.194 --> 39:19.127
Are you ready for that?

39:19.162 --> 39:21.363
Okay, let's go.

40:08.378 --> 40:10.378
Let's go, ladies!

40:10.414 --> 40:13.014
Yes, push!

40:13.049 --> 40:15.984
Good job!

40:16.019 --> 40:17.152
Yes, come on!

40:19.289 --> 40:22.023
Oh, hey. Emma's here.

40:22.058 --> 40:23.324
Hey!

40:25.195 --> 40:27.095
Hey, what's up?

40:27.130 --> 40:28.430
Well, since my best friend

40:28.465 --> 40:30.265
and my boyfriend are
obsessed with the derby,

40:30.300 --> 40:32.167
I thought...

40:32.202 --> 40:34.169
why not give it a try myself?

40:35.338 --> 40:38.039
We can always use fresh meat.

40:38.074 --> 40:39.174
- Uh, yeah.
- Totally!

40:39.210 --> 40:40.210
That's great.

40:42.212 --> 40:43.344
Cool.

40:46.049 --> 40:47.315
Thanks for coming today.

40:47.350 --> 40:48.494
We gotta keep your story alive

40:48.518 --> 40:51.052
until you get your DACA.

40:51.087 --> 40:52.498
Where'd you get that fancy new camera?

40:52.522 --> 40:55.323
Early graduation gift
from my birth father.

40:55.358 --> 40:57.058
Sweet!

40:57.093 --> 40:59.260
- See you home?
- I gotta stop at school first,

40:59.296 --> 41:01.162
but yeah, I'll see you there.
