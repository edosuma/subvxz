to get us all home again.

in this family we all trusted.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.023
Even with traffic,

13:36.148 --> 13:39.235
we should be able to be
at the Wadsworth Sanctuary for lunch.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.236

13:40.319 --> 13:44.490

13:44.573 --> 13:45.658

13:45.741 --> 13:51.580
And over here is...
just two miles from a vegan doughnut shop.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.000
Why would anyone do that
to a perfectly good doughnut?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.502
[chuckles]

13:59.463 --> 14:01.882
Looks like you got three years'
worth of stops mapped out.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.927
And we have time to see 'em all.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.436
-[man] Hey. Pardon me. Hey.
-[Allison] Oh--

14:55.519 --> 14:58.606
I gotta ask you to stay behind the lines.
We had an accident here last night.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.442
-[Allison] A-- What kind of accident?
-Ma'am. The line, please.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.735
Okay. Yes. Sorry.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.487
Got a lot of stuff on the ground, okay?
To be wary of.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.488
What happened?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.032
[officer] We're trying to figure that out.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.243
As soon as we do, you'll be able to read
it in the newspaper with everybody else.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.912
So, have a nice day.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.123
-Look, officer, if there is any way--
-Holy shit!

15:18.751 --> 15:19.835
You're Allison Hargreeves?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.046
I saw you on TV two nights ago

15:22.129 --> 15:25.049
in that Sandra Bullock movie
about underpaid teachers that rob a bank.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.344
-Yeah. That's me. [chuckles]
-[officer] Oh! Wow. Hey.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.264
If I'm being honest, my wife and I,
we prefer you in the romantic comedies.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.183
-[Allison] Oh.
-The <i>Love on Loan</i> trilogy.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.434
-Ouf!
-[chuckles]

15:35.517 --> 15:37.770
[officer] We can't get enough. [chuckles]

-[woman on radio] <i>Copy, Cheddar?</i>

15:42.024 --> 15:43.150

<i>just regained consciousness.</i>

15:46.570 --> 15:47.947

15:54.370 --> 15:55.621
-Wow.
-[chuckles]

15:55.704 --> 15:58.207
Ah, my wife's not gonna believe it.
[chuckles]

16:01.502 --> 16:03.003
Anyway, I-- I-- I... I gotta go.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.046
-Oh.
-[Cheddar] Um...

16:04.672 --> 16:07.424
-Work stuff. Yeah.
-Yeah, of course. Sorry. [chuckles]

16:09.426 --> 16:12.262
Actually, that's... why I'm here.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.099
I'm-- I'm researching a role.
A law enforcement role.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.602
In Jackpine Cove?
We haven't had a murder here in years.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.896
Oh, uh... it's about, um...
a small-town cop

16:20.980 --> 16:22.564
who takes down a drug cartel.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.319
In fact, maybe I could tag along
while you conduct
some official police business?

16:29.321 --> 16:31.365
I promise... I won't get in the way.
I just...

16:31.448 --> 16:34.451
I think you could really, um...
help me develop my character,

16:34.535 --> 16:36.495
if I could live a day in the life,
you know.

16:36.578 --> 16:37.871
[radio chatter]

16:41.041 --> 16:42.292
Day in the life, huh?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.255
Eh...

16:46.630 --> 16:47.464
Come on.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.674
Follow me.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.095
[indistinct chatter in background]

16:53.178 --> 16:54.888
You gotta get me out of here, bro.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.934
I can't. They're transferring you upstate
this afternoon.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.853
-I didn't kill Patch.
-I know.

17:01.645 --> 17:05.024
-I'm not the guy you gotta convince.
-That's bullshit, you know that.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.150
[sighs]

17:14.658 --> 17:16.160
[sighs] You were there, Diego.

17:17.036 --> 17:17.995
At the motel.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.583
And there's the...

17:24.293 --> 17:26.336
contentious history you two had.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.965
-Did she say that?
-What?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.341
Did she use that word?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.052
"Contentious"?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.847
-[sighs] What the hell does it matter?
-It matters to me.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.893
Answer the question.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.730
It's my word.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.071
[scoffs]
She put up with a lot of your shit.

17:53.781 --> 17:54.948
I never understood it.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.787
Maybe it had something to do with our...

18:01.246 --> 18:02.998
contentious relationship.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.708
[chuckles]

18:10.005 --> 18:13.509
Or maybe she knew you cared
about helping people as much as she did.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.138
[sighs]

18:20.390 --> 18:21.266
Good luck, Diego.

I don't even know where to begin.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.598
[Leonard] Think about last night.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.308
What was happening?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.144
Okay.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.689
We were leaving the restaurant.

They were out of control, and...

20:50.374 --> 20:52.334
-[Leonard] Hey.
-[Vanya] <i>...you tried to talk to them.</i>

21:15.983 --> 21:17.359
It was the sound of the engine that...

21:19.069 --> 21:21.989
It's like everything went quieter
and quieter.

21:23.573 --> 21:28.245
Except for the truck engine.
It-- It became louder and louder,

21:28.328 --> 21:30.539

-Where?
-To save the world.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.275
Oh, is that all? Great.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.695
So, Pogo said Dad killed himself
to get us all back together, right?

22:01.778 --> 22:03.822
-Yeah, so?
-So it got me thinking.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.158
I had to jump to the future
to figure out when it happened,

22:06.241 --> 22:08.035
but Dad, he can't time travel.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.037
So how'd the crazy bastard actually know

22:10.120 --> 22:12.122
to kill himself a week
before the end of the world?

22:12.205 --> 22:13.248
Well, you know...

22:13.332 --> 22:15.334
Don't answer. That was purely rhetorical.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.337
Truth is, our whole lives,
he's been telling us

22:18.420 --> 22:20.756
we'd save the world
from an impending apocalypse.

22:20.839 --> 22:24.259
Yeah, but I always thought he just said
that to scare us into doing the dishes.

22:24.343 --> 22:28.472
Me too. But what if the old man
really knew it was going to happen?

22:28.555 --> 22:30.432
-Yeah, but knew how?
-No idea.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.517
But the fact remains,
his fakakta plan worked.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.311
-[sniffs]
-We all came home.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.146
We're here,
we might as well save the world.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.649
-Oh yeah? What, like, the two of us?
-Uh, well, ideally, no, but...

22:40.317 --> 22:41.818

27:09.502 --> 27:12.839
Four years of nothing but soy paste
and processed air

I have the police report in the car,
Vanya. I can show you.

42:46.522 --> 42:47.815
I don't... I don't understand.

42:47.898 --> 42:51.026
Leonard, Harold, I--
I know it doesn't make any sense,

42:51.110 --> 42:54.655
and I know it sounds crazy,
but we were in his house.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.616
He has pictures of all of us
with our eyes gouged out.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.577
Wh-- What? I--

42:59.660 --> 43:02.246
I promise I will tell you everything
in the car, but it is not safe.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.664
No, stop. [sighs]

43:08.752 --> 43:09.795
Look, um...

43:10.671 --> 43:12.923
I can't imagine how hard it is for you
to hear this...

43:14.842 --> 43:16.510
how you feel right now, but I...

43:16.969 --> 43:18.762
I love you, and I--

43:19.430 --> 43:21.765
I just... I wanna be here for you,
as your sister.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.183
There's just no way.

43:25.394 --> 43:26.395
I love him.

43:29.565 --> 43:31.233
This just doesn't make any sense.

43:33.485 --> 43:35.195
And this power... I--

43:35.904 --> 43:38.032
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

43:39.533 --> 43:40.951
I don't know what to do.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.902

44:17.988 --> 44:19.365

44:20.491 --> 44:21.742
<i>You had to be isolated.</i>

44:23.452 --> 44:24.662
<i>We were so young.</i>

44:26.080 --> 44:27.790
<i>None of us knew to question it.</i>

44:29.708 --> 44:30.542
Now...

44:31.126 --> 44:33.295
you have to take your medicine

-I... I didn't realize.
-You knew this whole time?

46:16.315 --> 46:17.316
That I had powers?

46:17.399 --> 46:21.069
No, no! I didn't really understand
until I came today, until I saw it.

46:21.528 --> 46:24.156
Well, now it all makes sense.
This is why you never wanted me around.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.073
What? No!

46:25.157 --> 46:27.951
You couldn't risk me threatening
your place in the house,

46:28.035 --> 46:30.162
-your-- your dominance.
-That is not true.

46:30.245 --> 46:33.499
You couldn't handle the fact
that Dad might find <i>me </i>special.

46:33.582 --> 46:36.460
-You <i>are </i>special, with or without powers.
-Don't-- Don't say that!

46:36.543 --> 46:38.170
We have a chance to start over.

46:38.253 --> 46:39.713
You destroyed my life!

Oh, please, Vanya.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.258
Everything is out in the open.
We can move on!

46:43.342 --> 46:45.761
Oh, I'm moving on.
But not with you, with Leonard.
