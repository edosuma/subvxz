[soft piano music playing]

01:30.157 --> 01:31.723
[cellphone vibrates]

01:35.329 --> 01:36.462
[woman] Clay?

01:37.465 --> 01:39.431
-Tasha.
-Sorry I'm late.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.799
It was, uh...

01:41.302 --> 01:42.601
Please take a seat.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.103
I'm in no rush.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.938
You are so much more
beautiful in person.

01:46.006 --> 01:46.939
Thanks.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.407
You're not so bad yourself.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.210
Shall we start with a drink?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.246
Excuse me, miss?

01:56.350 --> 01:59.118
-So, Tasha, what do you think?
-[woman 2] Talia?

02:00.421 --> 02:02.254
Oh, my God. Hi.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.123
Hey.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.525
That's so funny.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.927
-What are the odds?
-Right?

02:08.929 --> 02:11.330
Huh, crazy.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.365
Anyway, what can I get
you guys?

02:13.433 --> 02:15.801
She'll have a Dark and Stormy.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.603
That's your drink, right?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.238
And I'll have a Guinness.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.339
Thank you.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.508
Wow, you really read
my profile.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.345
She's stalking you
or something?

02:26.413 --> 02:28.413
Do you want it taken care of?
I know a guy.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.115
No, she's, uh...

02:31.118 --> 02:32.818
we know each other
from school.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.419
Oh, right.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.423
Did she call you Talia?

02:39.026 --> 02:40.526
Did she?

02:40.528 --> 02:43.962
Oh, that was my nickname
in college.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.565
Why?

02:46.633 --> 02:49.201
Started as an inside joke
and then it just stuck.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.836
-There you go.
-Thank you.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.618
You embarrassed to be seen
with someone older?

03:08.923 --> 03:09.922
Yeah.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.057
A little.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.926
No offense.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.628
But you're attracted
to older men.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.432
Men your age, are like boys,
unsophisticated?

03:22.136 --> 03:23.535
No.

03:23.637 --> 03:28.240
I just have really serious
daddy issues.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.809
Okay if I call you papa?

03:31.312 --> 03:33.412
Uh, no, thanks.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.047
I already got two
that call me that.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.515
Kids?

03:36.517 --> 03:38.116
With my ex.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.953
Yeah, we were divorced
a little over a year ago.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.122
-Sorry.
-Well, I'm not.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.158
Best decision I ever made.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.628
The marriage was broken.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.763
As soon as I realized
that, I ended it.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.265
Wow.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.934
That's the secret
to happiness.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.937
Take charge of your destiny,
or someone else will.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.307
-It's funny.
-Mmm.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.343
I believe in going
with the flow.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.647
Surrendering to where life
takes you.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.415
Mmm.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.652
To surrendering control.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.520
Trust me.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.323
I'll make it worth your while.

04:20.227 --> 04:21.426
Okay.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.331
To surrendering control.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.958
[screams]

05:15.616 --> 05:17.115
Oh.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.551

05:38.839 --> 05:40.806
[mumbling indistinctly]

05:46.947 --> 05:49.214
What? Where are you?

05:50.818 --> 05:52.551
No! No!

05:58.058 --> 06:00.525
[line ringing]

06:02.763 --> 06:04.062
[Marvin] <i> Clay?</i>

06:04.098 --> 06:06.798
I, I...

06:06.800 --> 06:10.535
I can't, I can't, I can't...
it hurts.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.869
<i> Are you drunk?</i>

06:11.871 --> 06:13.939
<i> I'm due in the OR</i>
<i> this morning. I'm hanging up</i>

06:13.941 --> 06:16.408
I'm not... Marvin.
I'm not!

06:16.410 --> 06:18.310
Somebody's cut me open.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.445
It's... [screams, grunts]

06:20.514 --> 06:23.215
<i> Hey, hey, take a breath.</i>
<i> Okay, just calm down.</i>

06:24.118 --> 06:25.350
<i> Tell me what happened.</i>

06:26.620 --> 06:29.321
I woke up in a motel.

06:29.323 --> 06:32.157
Somebody cut me, like,
like an operation.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.826
It's over my scar.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.261
It's, it's...

06:36.329 --> 06:38.730
I'll send a pic.

06:44.004 --> 06:48.106
<i> Oh, okay, listen,</i>
<i> that's a surgical incision,</i>

06:48.108 --> 06:49.307
<i> and not a good one.</i>

06:49.309 --> 06:50.609
Is it my kidney?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.944
<i> Listen to me, you need</i>
<i> to get to a hospital now.</i>

06:52.946 --> 06:55.714
I can't, I can't.
I can't call.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.916
They left a message.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.719
A threat, Hannah and Jack,
they're watching them

07:00.721 --> 07:02.654
and if I do anything,
they'll--

07:02.723 --> 07:03.855
<i> Calm down.</i>

07:03.924 --> 07:05.323
<i> You can survive</i>
<i> with one kidney.</i>

07:05.325 --> 07:07.526
Marvin, it's over my scar.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.662
<i> Oh, jeez.</i>

07:10.731 --> 07:12.364
<i> You only had one kidney.</i>

07:12.433 --> 07:13.799
Am I gonna die?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.033
<i> You're not going to die.</i>

07:15.102 --> 07:17.002
<i> You can survive without</i>
<i> any kidneys,</i>

07:17.004 --> 07:19.838
<i> but you need hemo dialysis.</i>
<i> In 48 hours,</i>

07:19.907 --> 07:21.306
<i> you'll go into septic shock</i>

07:22.342 --> 07:23.542
<i> Where are you?</i>

07:23.844 --> 07:26.645
...motel.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.315
I texted you the address.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.819
<i> I'll be there in 30 minutes</i>
<i> Don't drink or eat anything</i>

Snake.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.500
Bitch. I'll kill you
for what you did.

07:49.203 --> 07:51.636
You, you sick fraud.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.705
[screams]

08:12.626 --> 08:14.459
Clay, wake up.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.628
Clay?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.129
Nod if you can hear me.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.131
Come on, buddy.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.603
Stay with me.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.737
You're okay.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.038
You're good.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.809
-It feels weird.
-I cleaned and dressed
your incision

08:30.811 --> 08:32.043
and gave you something
for the pain,

08:32.045 --> 08:33.612
but we got to get you
to a hospital.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.946
No, no hospital.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.315
Sorry, Clay, doctor's orders.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.452
I need water.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.954
Your guts are gonna turn
on you if you eat
or drink anything now.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.623
All right? Let's go, buddy.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.124
Come on.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.962
Listen, Clay, I had to push
a procedure to this afternoon.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.831
Said I had a family emergency.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.900
You got to tell me
what's going on.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.701
What's the last thing
you remember?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.237
-Stop the car.
-I'm going to try
and get you onto dialysis,

08:59.339 --> 09:01.239
-okay?
-I have a friend
in nephrology.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.807
No one can know about this.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.476
How did this even
happened, Clay?

09:04.478 --> 09:06.545
[cellphone vibrating]

09:15.956 --> 09:17.055
Who is this?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.623
[man] <i> Can't you read?</i>

09:18.625 --> 09:20.859
<i> That is your kidney.</i>

09:20.927 --> 09:22.360
<i> You really should have</i>
<i> treated me better,</i>

09:22.429 --> 09:23.628
<i> or I wouldn't have left.</i>

09:23.630 --> 09:26.131
I'm gonna kill you.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.501
<i> You want this thing back</i>
<i> or not?</i>

09:30.304 --> 09:32.037
What do you want?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.839
<i> -You called the cops?</i>
-No, I swear.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.141
<i> I hope not</i>

09:36.209 --> 09:37.709
<i> for your kids' sake.</i>

09:38.912 --> 09:40.812
<i> 2655 Golf Road.</i>

09:40.814 --> 09:42.314
<i> Price when you get here.</i>

09:43.150 --> 09:46.051
How much, how much
do you want?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.053
<i> Rest of my life.</i>

09:48.055 --> 09:50.722
What does that mean?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.926
[line disconnects]

09:56.029 --> 09:57.529
-Stop the car.
-No, listen, Clay,

09:57.531 --> 09:58.763
we gotta get you
to the hospital.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.165
Stop the...car.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.434
[grunts]

10:05.505 --> 10:08.506
They gave me an address
and they just want money.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.941
I can get this back.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.344
How do you know
you can trust them?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.379
I don't.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.215
But what choice do I have?
How does this go for me?

10:17.217 --> 10:21.453
I get on a donors list
and wait, what,
two years, three?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.155
Average wait is four years.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.957
Four.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.360
You told me it was
48 hours, right?
Before I need treatment?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.062
-That's plenty of time.
-48 hours maximum.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.631
It's probably more
like 36 now.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.200
[breathing heavily]

10:36.937 --> 10:38.970
They just want money.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.605
It's all anybody ever wants.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.307
I need your help, Marvin.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.908
I can't do this alone.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.312
Man.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.814
What am I doing?

11:13.407 --> 11:14.939
So now what?

11:25.819 --> 11:27.719
I think I know how to get in.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.550
Hello? I'm here.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.519
How'd these guys even get
my name?

12:01.521 --> 12:02.954
Why target me?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.023
You're rich.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.793
Okay, then why here?

12:08.795 --> 12:10.495
I don't know, man.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.897
I don't like the look
of this place.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.955
You get any signal?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.161
-Nope.
-Me neither.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.230
Okay.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.364
We're done.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.632
Wait, wait.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.933
We haven't even looked
around yet.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.101
Few more minutes.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.436
Okay, you check downstairs.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.437
I'll go check upstairs.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.205
Meet me back here
in 10 minutes, okay?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.407
You don't find anything.
That's it, I'm out.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.509
We'll find him.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.410
I'll write him a check,
get me the kidney back

12:59.412 --> 13:00.512
then we'll go to the ER.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.514
All right? That's how
this whole operation works.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.816
All right.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.785
Just don't do anything
stupid, Clay.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.623
[grunting]

14:33.673 --> 14:35.440
[camera shutter clicks]

14:38.011 --> 14:39.510
[camera shutter clicks]

15:06.673 --> 15:08.106
[man] Hey!

15:09.242 --> 15:10.675
Those aren't free.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.148
It's a little bit much,
isn't it?

15:17.217 --> 15:20.418
You guys trying to scare me?
What are those, pig hearts?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.055
So what are we talking
about here?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.356
I haven't got all day.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.900
250,000. Sign here.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.105
I know, it's an arm and a leg.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.529
You know, this isn't even
my kidney.

16:04.531 --> 16:09.400
My ex-wife,
she donated it to me
when both of mine failed.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.936
Wow. Hope you bought her
some flowers.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.604
I wouldn't have issue
with the price if it was mine,

16:13.673 --> 16:16.107
but it's, it's kind of
pre-owned, you know?

16:16.910 --> 16:19.944
250 seems a little bit steep.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.879
How much would these go for
on the black market right now?

16:21.881 --> 16:24.415
Right, whatever like 10, 20?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.151
How about 100 even?

16:28.054 --> 16:29.921
This isn't a flea market.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.825
Whoa, hold--
Wait, wait, wait, I'll sign.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.793
You can afford it, Clay.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.829
We know all about
your offshore hidey hole.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.235
Don't... with us. Our boss
is watching your kids.

16:44.904 --> 16:45.770
Believe me.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.805
You don't wanna piss him off.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.411
Hey.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.812
[grunts]

16:55.682 --> 16:57.415
Hey.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.422
[groaning] No.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.957
What are you doing?

17:05.959 --> 17:08.026
We're gonna take
your other kidney too.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.528
No, I only had one kidney.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.430
You weren't listening.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.299
That's a new one.
Says he doesn't have
another kidney.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.302
Oh, please. Listen to me,
listen to me, please.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.871
Please, please, listen.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.406
[grunts] No.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.509
Please.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.810
Don't.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.413
No, no, no, no.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.715
[grunts]

17:55.108 --> 17:57.942
[screaming]

18:25.805 --> 18:27.305
[groans]

18:32.112 --> 18:33.544
Marvin.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.214
Hello?

18:38.251 --> 18:39.784
Marvin.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.019
Where are you?

18:47.961 --> 18:50.161
[line ringing]

18:52.732 --> 18:54.365
<i> You reached Dr. Marvin Bell</i>

18:54.433 --> 18:56.501
<i> If this is an emergency,</i>
<i> please call 911</i>

18:56.503 --> 18:58.503
<i> or go to your nearest</i>
<i> emergency room.</i>

18:58.505 --> 19:00.938
<i> If this is a personal matter</i>
<i> please leave a message.</i>

19:01.908 --> 19:03.941
Hey, man, where are you?

19:04.043 --> 19:05.710
Give me a call back.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.513
I got jumped.
I didn't get it.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.816
They conned me.
They ripped me off.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.320
So I'm in a taxi heading
towards the hospital.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.524
I don't know know what else
to do at this point.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.162
Where'd you go then?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.064
Give me a call back
when you get this.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.834
I hope...

19:29.936 --> 19:31.536
I hope you're okay.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.677
[cellphone chimes]

19:48.521 --> 19:50.321
Hey, change of plans.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.162
Okay, ladies, who had
the Singapore Sling?

19:58.264 --> 19:59.864
Who is she?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.301
-I'm sorry?
-You called her Talia.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.803
Tell me her address now.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.905
I'm sorry I don't know
who you're talking about.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.911
[gasps]

20:15.114 --> 20:16.847
My manager is calling
the cops.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.351
Your friend ruined my life,
I want to talk to her.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.119
Tell me where she lives
and I'll leave.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.055
-I don't know the address.
-What?

20:24.057 --> 20:27.058
It's an apartment building
on Alexander and it's...

20:27.060 --> 20:28.859
and there's a pizza place
across from it.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.134
[breath trembling]

20:50.216 --> 20:51.782
[woman screams]

20:51.784 --> 20:53.818

20:55.955 --> 20:58.055
[grunting]

21:01.961 --> 21:03.561
[screams]

21:18.211 --> 21:19.310
Scream and I'll shoot.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.311
[panting]

21:22.115 --> 21:23.347
Where is it?

21:23.416 --> 21:25.850
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.252
Where is my kidney?

21:28.354 --> 21:31.422
I don't, I don't know anything
about that.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.623
I don't know.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.060
Who sent you to meet me?

21:36.129 --> 21:39.063
This guy messaged me
on the app, okay?

21:39.165 --> 21:42.233
He just said he wanted to play
a practical joke on someone.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.801
I don't know, okay?

21:44.937 --> 21:47.405
He gave me $5,000
to match with you,

21:47.407 --> 21:50.441
to go out on a date
and to slip something
into your drink.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.842
What could go wrong?

21:52.945 --> 21:55.713
I just really needed
the money.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.716
-Who hired you?
-His name was Jacob

21:58.785 --> 22:01.819
and but it was a fake picture,
Victor probably wasn't
his real name, okay?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.822
I heard his name.
I heard his name.
I heard his name, okay?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.524
[coughs]

22:06.526 --> 22:10.528
A person on the phone
called him Marvin.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.829
Okay? Marvin.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.732
He was Black,
he was about your age.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.134
What is this?

22:17.804 --> 22:19.103
Stop lying to me.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.504
I swear, I swear.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.024
Yeah, that's him.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.325
That's him.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.161
So sorry, I'm really...

22:45.732 --> 22:47.131
[grunts]

22:52.705 --> 22:54.105
[yells]

22:55.241 --> 22:58.209
No, no, no. No, no, no.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.052
...do that for?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.302
[engine starts]

25:09.509 --> 25:10.975
Hi, Amy.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.011
I should have figured
that out sooner.

25:24.056 --> 25:27.458
So the guys in the basement,
guess you hired them too, huh?

25:28.528 --> 25:30.327
Like the girl?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.063
Don't you...move.

25:40.172 --> 25:43.107
I said don't move.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.779
So why? Why, Marvin?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.348
Because it's mine

25:53.719 --> 25:55.519
and I wanted it back.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.524
You wanted your kidney back?

26:00.526 --> 26:02.726
You cheated on me
with someone half your age,

26:02.795 --> 26:04.528
then you decide you're done
being married.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.096
Okay.

26:06.098 --> 26:11.101
Then I get everything back
that's mine. Everything.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.103
You're insane.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.874
You ruined my...life, Amy.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.609
Good.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.277
Now you know how it feels.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.280
This is...

26:23.282 --> 26:25.716
You loved giving me
your kidney.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.518
You couldn't shut up about it.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.621
You want to walk away,
you give me back everything

26:30.623 --> 26:31.889
that's mine.

26:33.526 --> 26:36.226
[sniffs] And the money?

26:36.262 --> 26:39.029
I didn't like the settlement
the court landed on,

26:39.031 --> 26:41.765
it didn't seem fair.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.937
You're going to jail.
Both of you.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.307
How could you do this?

26:51.010 --> 26:52.610
And you take an oath.

26:52.678 --> 26:56.347
Sorry, Clay, you brought this
on yourself.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.223
You...

27:06.292 --> 27:08.626
you ruined five lives
with this stunt.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.631
Hannah and Jack are going
to be traumatized.

27:13.732 --> 27:14.965
You hear me?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.967
You think I'm a monster?

27:17.703 --> 27:19.103
You're worse.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.209
[panting]

27:34.987 --> 27:36.787
I'm going to hospital now.

27:39.525 --> 27:42.126
I'm going to call the cops
on the way.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.294
[Amy] Clay,

27:45.097 --> 27:46.697
we're over here.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.300
It's getting a little
blurry, Clay?

27:50.903 --> 27:52.169
Double vision?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.607
Well, you want to take
that chance?

27:56.709 --> 27:58.208
'Cause I'll do it.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.177
I've already crossed
the line today.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.212
You don't even know
the half of it!

28:04.417 --> 28:06.550
-[screams]
-[Amy screams]

28:39.018 --> 28:40.851
[groans]

29:57.329 --> 29:59.062
[Amy] <i> You're wrong, Clay.</i>

30:00.065 --> 30:01.932
<i> I'm better than you.</i>

30:02.802 --> 30:03.834
<i> I know I am.</i>

30:05.805 --> 30:08.505
So I'm going to do something
for you

30:08.507 --> 30:10.440
that you never would do
for me.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.443
I'm gonna give you a chance.

30:15.281 --> 30:20.317
<i> One of these roads</i>
<i> leads to a store</i>
<i> about 10 miles away,</i>

30:20.319 --> 30:23.987
the others go nowhere.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.124
If you can get to a phone
in time,

30:27.126 --> 30:30.527
you could get to a hospital
and I'll let you keep
the kidney.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.997
Marvin says you have
about 12 hours

30:33.999 --> 30:38.035
<i> and besides if you make it</i>
<i> out alive,</i>

30:38.037 --> 30:43.540
<i> I like the idea that</i>
<i> there might be a piece</i>
<i> of me inside you.</i>

30:49.548 --> 30:50.948
[sobs]

30:50.950 --> 30:54.618
Oh, and don't bother calling
the police.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.053
We know about the girl.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.056
Good luck.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.061
[sobs]

31:04.730 --> 31:06.330
I'm sorry.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.934
So sorry.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.208
[breathing heavily]

31:51.410 --> 31:53.310
Go with the flow.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.679
Go with the flow.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.814
Go with the flow.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.411
All right, that was
<i> The Harvest,</i>

33:34.413 --> 33:36.546
a classic, classic
urban legend.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.349
Probably the most known,
the one we all heard as kids.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.219
And I'm here with
the incredible
talented director

33:42.221 --> 33:43.186
Jason Lapeyre.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.421
Jason, pleasure, man.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.655
Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Thanks, Eli.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.424
So, I love what you did with
the room here.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.493
-Beautiful, beautiful
decoration.
-Yeah, it got a little messy

33:49.495 --> 33:50.527
in here.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.828
But we're gonna make the best
of it.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.331
A little bit. So tell me,
like, you're doing <i> The Harve</i>

33:54.333 --> 33:58.402
which is probably the best
known urban legend.

33:58.404 --> 34:01.471
And, you know, it's one
that's been told before,

34:01.473 --> 34:02.773
it's been filmed before.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.341
It's also one of
my favorite stories

34:04.443 --> 34:06.443
'cause you still hear stories
about it happening

34:06.445 --> 34:07.411
in different places.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.413
Was this an urban legend
you grew up with?

34:09.415 --> 34:12.049
I think everyone knows
this urban legend, right?

34:12.051 --> 34:14.785
Like, it's pretty universal.
It happens in every culture.

34:14.787 --> 34:15.919
There's some variation of it.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.789
I had heard that, of course,
and believed it was real

34:18.791 --> 34:20.824
and probably until
the internet, you know.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.527
When I started researching it
and started digging into it.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.829
It got pretty funny
pretty fast

34:25.931 --> 34:29.299
how insanely unrealistic
it actually is.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.002
Like, someone online
had actually done, like,

34:32.004 --> 34:34.071
okay, let's say this actually
was going to happen.

34:34.073 --> 34:36.706
In order to do
a kidney surgery,

34:36.775 --> 34:39.443
at the bare minimum,
a number of technicians
involved is, like,

34:39.544 --> 34:42.112
six or seven people
who would all have to violate

34:42.114 --> 34:43.613
-the Hippocratic Oath
-Right?

34:43.682 --> 34:47.017
in order to do it,
it's not actually
realistically possible.

34:47.019 --> 34:48.952
And then the other thing
that I thought was
really funny about it

34:48.954 --> 34:50.787
is that one of
the consistent components

34:50.789 --> 34:53.190
of the legend and all
its variations is that

34:53.192 --> 34:55.292
the victim wakes up
in a tub of ice.

34:55.294 --> 34:56.460
Oh, that was it,
the bath tub's full of ice.

34:56.528 --> 34:59.162
It's always the funny thing.
I laughed out loud

34:59.164 --> 35:01.965
when I realized
that that's actually

35:01.967 --> 35:05.001
a result of the broken
telephone of an urban legend.

35:05.003 --> 35:09.106
It's not the victim that has
to be on ice. It's the kidney.

35:09.174 --> 35:12.609
[laughs] So in the telling
has evolved into this thing,

35:12.611 --> 35:13.977
where the guy wakes up
in a tub of ice.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.612
So I sort of made
this creative decision

35:15.614 --> 35:18.315
in the telling of our version,
that we're not going

35:18.317 --> 35:19.950
to have him wake up
in a tub of ice.

35:19.952 --> 35:22.319
We're going to have
a tub of ice next
to the hotel room,

35:22.321 --> 35:25.322
and, you know, the kidney's
on ice throughout the episode.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.390
But I thought I'd take
this opportunity to correct

35:27.392 --> 35:28.725
the urban legend.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.327
Well, to ground it
a little bit, you know
what I mean?

35:30.329 --> 35:32.262
Like, I think one of
the things we're trying to do

35:32.330 --> 35:34.531
is make these scarier
by bringing them as close

35:34.533 --> 35:36.032
to reality as we can, right?

35:36.034 --> 35:37.334
-Like that's gonna make it
scarier.
-Yeah.

35:37.435 --> 35:40.303
The more realistic
that the episode could be,

35:40.305 --> 35:42.339
the more closer
to actual possibility,

35:42.407 --> 35:44.674
I thought it'd be a little
more effective
for the audience.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.182
[screams]

35:58.524 --> 36:00.557
<i> That's so interesting, becau</i>
<i> I'm sure a lot of people</i>

36:00.625 --> 36:02.526
<i> would be like they missed</i>
<i> the part about the tub of ic</i>

36:02.528 --> 36:04.361
-Yeah.
-But of course, I mean, yeah,

36:04.429 --> 36:06.730
you could wake up in a bathtub
full of ice with, like,

36:06.732 --> 36:09.032
they take your kidney
and now they want
your swelling to go down?

36:09.034 --> 36:10.167
-Like...
-[laughs] No.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.701
-That're that conscientious
-It was definitely...

36:11.703 --> 36:13.670
to fill a tub with ice
and put you in it.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.704
You wouldn't notice that.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.206
-After you die
of hypothermia.
-I know.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.807
-Yeah, it's like what?
-It's another really
funny part

36:17.809 --> 36:20.410
of the original urban legend
is, like, these people

36:20.412 --> 36:22.512
were vicious enough to take
your kidney out

36:22.514 --> 36:23.713
in an illegal surgery,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.015
but they want to make sure
you're okay.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.249
-They wanna make sure
you recovered.
-Yeah.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.218
The recovery has to go well.
The recovery has to go well,

36:28.220 --> 36:31.221
-so you can tell the legend
to other people.
-Yeah.

36:31.223 --> 36:35.058
What excited you about
directing this
particular tale?

36:35.060 --> 36:37.260
When I first heard about
the episode

36:37.329 --> 36:39.629
and I started thinking
about it, started
digging into it.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.132
What I really started
to think about

36:42.200 --> 36:45.101
was what anxiety does
this urban legend express?

36:45.103 --> 36:47.504
And for me, I decided
it was about loss of control.

36:47.506 --> 36:51.074
I think there's a reason why
it's always a story about

36:51.076 --> 36:53.343
a man who loses consciousness
and wakes up

36:53.412 --> 36:55.078
with a piece of himself
missing.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.113
I thought that was, like,
a great starting point

36:57.182 --> 37:02.219
for a story about
slowly losing all control.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.354
The other thing I got
really excited about

37:04.456 --> 37:05.889
when I started zeroing in
on that,

37:05.891 --> 37:08.925
is, like, the heart of
the story was thinking

37:08.927 --> 37:11.795
about film noir,
which is one of
my favorite genres.

37:11.797 --> 37:15.198
And my favorite film noirs
are the ones that spin

37:15.200 --> 37:17.801
the most out of control,
where the protagonist

37:17.803 --> 37:21.404
really starts to have, like,
a psychological breakdown

37:21.406 --> 37:24.608
and is just by the end
of the story struggling

37:24.610 --> 37:25.775
to hold on.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.445
I like movies where
it almost starts to feel like

37:28.513 --> 37:30.513
you're inside the head
of the protagonist

37:30.515 --> 37:33.116
and it's, like, are the things
that are happening
actually happening?

37:33.185 --> 37:35.218
Or is this some sort of,
like, surreal,

37:35.220 --> 37:37.988
heightened perception
that the protagonist

37:37.990 --> 37:39.488
is happening, you know?

37:39.490 --> 37:42.025
So we looked throughout
the episode for
little surreal touches

37:42.027 --> 37:43.727
that we could do, like,
those portraits of the kids

37:43.729 --> 37:44.794
in the background.

37:44.796 --> 37:47.631
Hannah and Jack
are gonna be traumatized.

37:47.732 --> 37:49.232
You hear me?

37:49.334 --> 37:50.934
Over and over again,
throughout the episode,

37:50.936 --> 37:54.204
you'll see point of view
shots sort of slide in
and out of focus.

37:54.206 --> 37:56.673
The protagonist is slowly
losing control.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.308
Clay...

37:59.177 --> 38:00.710
we're over here.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.414
Things getting
little blurry, Clay?

38:05.217 --> 38:06.349
Double vision?

38:08.887 --> 38:10.320
Well, you want to take
that chance?

38:10.322 --> 38:12.422
You're a very experienced
director,

38:12.424 --> 38:14.824
do you still shot list,
storyboard?

38:14.926 --> 38:17.527
You know, these shows
that we're doing
shoot very fast

38:17.529 --> 38:19.629
and on a low budget,
but you never feel that

38:19.631 --> 38:20.530
watching your work.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.831
It has such an elegance.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.933
I was just curious about
your process as a director

38:23.935 --> 38:25.034
approaching material.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.104
Thank you, yeah. No, I mean,
preparation is key.

38:28.173 --> 38:29.606
It's crucial, but at
the same time,

38:29.675 --> 38:31.474
I don't want to prepare
to the point where

38:31.476 --> 38:34.511
it's calcified, you know?
Like, I don't want to just
be shooting a comic book.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.880
-I assume you're a fan
of body horror.
-Oh, yeah, big time.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.015
Being Canadian, you must
have grown up with Cronenberg.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.717
-Cronenberg's the man.
-What was the first

38:40.719 --> 38:44.220
Cronenberg film that got you
so intensely excited

38:44.222 --> 38:46.523
to either make movies
or really freaked you out?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.391
<i> The Fly.</i>  Like,
no question, right?

38:48.393 --> 38:50.694
Like, <i> The Fly</i>  is a waking
nightmare.

38:50.696 --> 38:55.065
And any film that can make me
feel like I'm experiencing

38:55.067 --> 38:57.067
a waking nightmare
is just instantly in my,

38:57.069 --> 38:58.868
you know, all time
hall of fame.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.705
I think it's a great lesson
in how prosthetic effects

39:01.806 --> 39:03.707
are, like, a crucial
important part of horror,

39:03.709 --> 39:06.609
but you need an incredible
performance behind them

39:06.611 --> 39:08.745
-in order to sell
the prosthetic effects.
-Yes.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.714
One of your most powerful
tools as a filmmaker

39:10.716 --> 39:13.550
is the audience's imagination
and the less you show them,

39:13.685 --> 39:15.084
the better.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.087
If you just give them,
like, eight frames
of a prosthetic effect

39:17.089 --> 39:18.822
<i> and cut to a great</i>
<i> reaction shot</i>

39:18.890 --> 39:21.257
<i> then you're... the world</i>
<i> is your oyster.</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:25.495
<i> That's another reason</i>
<i> I was really excited</i>
<i> about this episode.</i>

39:25.497 --> 39:28.365
<i> I think our central</i>
<i> protagonist Adam Fawns</i>

39:28.433 --> 39:30.500
<i> knocked it out of the park</i>
<i> with his performance.</i>

39:30.502 --> 39:32.669
And you know, as well as I do
that when you're selling

39:32.671 --> 39:35.772
a prosthetic effect,
it's not the prosthetic
effect.

39:35.774 --> 39:38.208
It's cutting back
to the actor's face

39:38.210 --> 39:39.909
-to sell the prosthetic
effect.
-Absolutely.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.644
I can tell you're excited
about <i> The Fly</i>

39:41.646 --> 39:42.879
'cause you're doing
the Jeff Goldblum.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.048
-Ah. Look at me. Let's go.
-[laughs]

39:45.050 --> 39:47.217
I'm gonna, I'm gonna vomit
over my hand,

39:47.219 --> 39:48.418
-in a sec.
-Wow.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.320
And we're gonna change
the world.

39:50.322 --> 39:52.222
Sorry,
it's my Goldblum impression.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.057
You think about all
those movies from the '80s

39:54.059 --> 39:56.726
that are the pinnacle
of press... practical effects,

39:56.795 --> 39:58.294
like <i> American Werewolf</i>
<i> in London,</i>

39:58.296 --> 40:00.029
and <i> The Thing</i>  and <i> The </i>

40:00.031 --> 40:02.198
They're all anchored
by incredible performances.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.001
-It's not a coincidence.
-And there's that thing
of, you know,

40:05.003 --> 40:07.337
like <i> Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>
where the girl gets hung
on the meat hook and

40:07.439 --> 40:09.739
people swear they remember
seeing the hook going

40:09.741 --> 40:11.307
-through the stomach.
-That's right. That's right.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.978
The gore has to be just
enough that you're, like,
covering your eyes

40:14.980 --> 40:17.781
and the sound, but if you...
it's like if you don't give
them enough,

40:17.783 --> 40:19.716
people get frustrated
or you deliver it in a way

40:19.718 --> 40:20.817
they're not expecting.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.251
Part of the problem is that
we love that...right?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.120
-So we always want more
and more, more, more and more.
-Yeah.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.722
But there is a fine line
like you say,

40:25.791 --> 40:27.791
it's like you can pull it back
to a point where

40:27.793 --> 40:29.559
they are doing the work
in their head

40:29.628 --> 40:31.528
and imagine a hook going
through her chest.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.797
I'm a big urban legend nerd
because I grew up

40:33.799 --> 40:35.832
in Massachusetts in the '80s

40:35.900 --> 40:37.967
when that was all we did
was tell urban legends.

40:37.969 --> 40:40.403
And I know that this one
had been done to death,

40:40.405 --> 40:43.606
losing control of your body,
these things that are ours.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.308
The idea that
you're not donating it

40:45.310 --> 40:48.311
to save someone's life,
it's willfully being taken
from you.

40:48.313 --> 40:50.980
Just seeing that story
actualized was something that

40:50.982 --> 40:52.115
was really important to me.

40:52.184 --> 40:54.617
It's the urban legend
that is the most known,

40:54.619 --> 40:56.186
but I wanted to see it done

40:56.188 --> 40:58.521
and I absolutely love the way
you did it.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.223
One of the reasons we thought
it was important to put

41:00.225 --> 41:02.325
a real twist on it because
it was so common.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.327
We wanted to throw
a few curveballs
at the audience.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.529
Well, what if someone stole
his kidney,

41:06.531 --> 41:08.131
and he only had one kidney?

41:08.199 --> 41:09.933
-It's a great twist.
-So that was a great twist

41:09.935 --> 41:11.601
and then the other idea
and this really speaks

41:11.603 --> 41:15.004
to the urban legend nature
of the story is the idea that

41:15.006 --> 41:19.008
a wife did this
to her ex-husband as revenge

41:19.010 --> 41:20.543
is based on a true story.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.612
There was a woman
in the States,

41:22.714 --> 41:24.380
as part of a divorce
settlement

41:24.382 --> 41:27.183
demanded her kidney back
from her husband

41:27.185 --> 41:28.618
that she had donated to him.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.253
And the court did not agree.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.188
-Yeah... wow.
-Well, we wrote it.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.224
We thought well,
what if they did?

41:34.226 --> 41:37.627
All right, so for people
that are watching <i> The Harves</i>

41:37.696 --> 41:39.329
and learning about you
and your work,

41:39.331 --> 41:41.130
what are some other work
of yours that

41:41.199 --> 41:43.433
they can check out
and where can they find you?

41:43.535 --> 41:45.869
-My first feature is a film
called <i> Cold Blooded</i>
-Yeah.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.437
which is very much like
<i> The Harvest,</i>

41:47.539 --> 41:48.872
a fusion of two
different genres.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.874
It's a crime movie
and a horror movie.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.275
The movie that
I'm most proud of

41:52.277 --> 41:54.010
is a movie called
<i> I Declare War.</i>

41:54.012 --> 41:56.679
-Amazing. Where can people,
like, dig deeper to find you
-Absolutely.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.114
-and reach out?
