00:44.920 --> 00:49.926
What separates the casual Jane
Austen fan from the aficionado?

00:50.640 --> 00:55.806
Is it her admiration for the style
and manners of the Regency era?

00:56.480 --> 00:59.848
The number of times
she has read Austen's novels?

01:00.080 --> 01:03.687
Or her consuming love
for Mr. Darcy?

01:09.160 --> 01:12.050
<i>♪ L-O-V-E-D-A-R-C-Y</i>

Okay.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.886

02:15.280 --> 02:16.486
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

02:16.560 --> 02:18.289
Well, I heard you
broke up with Greg.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.882
So that means you're free
to go bowling tonight.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.610
Oops!
Jimmy! You know what?

02:23.760 --> 02:26.240
If "no" was
unclear last time...

02:27.680 --> 02:29.011
I don't wanna see you again.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.165
I picked you on purpose, Jane Hayes.
Thirty plus, clock ticking.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.408
I'm as good as it gets, baby.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.763
<i>MRS. WATTLESBROOK: A true aficionado

Excuse me.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.407
She finds her way here

02:49.360 --> 02:54.685
to the world's only immersive
Austen experience.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.600
MOLLY:
Is that a Chihuahua?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.684
It's a lamb. Shut up.
Just trying to hear it.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.926
This looks really cheap.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.002
AGENT: I've toured the grounds
and it's not cheap.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.488
This is high class.
This is big time.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.206
Jane, are you really
gonna blow your entire

03:09.320 --> 03:11.846
life savings on
an "Austen experience"?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.770
Now, hold on just a second,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.006
here at Sensuous Travel,

03:15.120 --> 03:17.248
we are not just another
run-of-the-mill vacation place.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.887
This is what we call
an "LC." A Life-Changer.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.244
You get to play the heroine of
your very own Jane Austen story.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.125
Would you like to
see some of the staff?

03:27.360 --> 03:28.964
Yeah.
No.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.006
Now this is Barnaby.
He's a vegan.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.082
He enjoys nightly
dips in the pond,

03:34.200 --> 03:36.202
and he has a pony
named Sparkles Pancake.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.770
That is horrendous.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.446
I also heard that people in those
days didn't wear underwear.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.567
That's a lie.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.641
It's not a lie.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.250
Look, every stay at Austenland
ends with a real live ball,

03:47.440 --> 03:50.728
as in ballroom,
as in happily ever after.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.167
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

03:52.320 --> 03:53.321
Totally.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.002
Jane. So you go on some fancy vacation,
then what do you come home to?

03:58.120 --> 04:00.248
Nothing except for
an empty bank account.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.081
Why don't you save up
for a real life-changer?

04:05.200 --> 04:07.043
Like what?
Well, like...

04:07.200 --> 04:09.726
That's fine. Maybe come back
another time without your friend.

04:09.840 --> 04:10.921
We'll get you squared away.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.162
I think I can figure out some
kind of layaway program for you.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.525
Thank you so much.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.923
You guys take care. Thanks for being you.
Appreciate you.

04:25.960 --> 04:30.682
Listen, this is my one chance to
really live in Austen's world. Okay?

04:30.840 --> 04:32.285
I'm her biggest fan.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.527
Come on.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.727
No. No.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.604
You used to be a fan.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.490
You are an addict.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.087
You don't have to go in there because
I'm packing. It's a mess in there.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.531
You don't wanna go in there.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.207
Oh, Janey.
It's gotten so much worse.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.721
(SQUEAKING)
I love you.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.524
It's a collector's item
and that's why I have it.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.726
<i>I have 10,000 a year.</i>

04:54.640 --> 04:56.051
I've changed my mind.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.965
I totally support you
going to this place,

04:59.160 --> 05:01.401
because I'm sure
that the fantasy

05:01.560 --> 05:03.767
will not be as
fulfilling as you imagine.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.331
I don't think you
know where I'm going.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.370
We could make a wager on it.
Fine.

05:08.480 --> 05:12.690
If I win,
you de-Austen your room.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.082
Okay.
Fine.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.405
And if you really must go, I
made you a little farewell gift.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.090
You did?

05:24.080 --> 05:25.411
Aw.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.841
Wow.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.331
Which historical era
is this supposed to be from?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.687
Hey, I spent three
days working on it.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.609
Come here, let's hug it out.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.285
Thank you.
Okay.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.928
When you get back, just clear
this crap out because it's weird.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.525

supposed to wait, right?

I'm Miss Elizabeth Charming.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.323
It's a pretty name, isn't it?
I requested it.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.364
Yes, it's very beautiful.
I can't wait to pick a name.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.487
How about Miss Pepperpot?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.887

07:31.040 --> 07:33.247
Those are nice.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.244

would be magical.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.330

a car from the 1800s.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.528
Oh, thank you so much.

supposed to wear a costume.

we go to the big house.

Okay.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.450

about my pseudonym,

08:57.640 --> 09:00.450

Miss Joyful, maybe?

09:00.560 --> 09:03.928
Oh, yes. You've already
been assigned a name.

Ma'am.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.369
Good luck.
Thanks.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.689
Complete immersion

appreciate Austen's England.

Righto!

09:31.040 --> 09:32.929
Just to avoid any confusion,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.164
I'd like you to know that we do
offer several distinct experiences.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.684
You have paid for
the Basic Copper package,

09:41.240 --> 09:43.720
while the other
ladies in the party

09:43.840 --> 09:46.320
are part of
the Platinum Elite package.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.090
Oh. Okay.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.481
I'm sure you'll understand there will
be some exclusions to your trip.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.047
I mean, I'm just so
excited to be here,

09:54.120 --> 09:56.282
and I've dreamed
about this for so long.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.328
All of my guests
will experience

09:58.400 --> 10:00.528
romance with one of our actors.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.683
But I must emphasize
there is to be no touching

10:04.280 --> 10:07.887
other than the necessary social graces.
Not a chance.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.969
I also expect
all my guests to maintain

10:10.080 --> 10:12.003
appropriate manners
and conversation

10:12.120 --> 10:14.487
and to eschew
all things modern.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.290
Any flagrant
disobedience will result

10:16.360 --> 10:17.930
in the early
termination of your stay.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.806
You don't have
to worry about me.

books intimately.

Top of the evening to you.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.048
And Miss Jane Erstwhile.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.090
An orphan of no fortune,
who we've taken in

15:20.160 --> 15:22.049
out of the goodness
of our hearts.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.800
Colonel Andrews, the second
son of the Earl of Denton.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.884
I have never before
beheld such beauty...

15:33.200 --> 15:34.690
And class.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.730
What a very pleasant
pleasure it is indeed.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.684

Henry Nobley.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.131

There's one for each of us.

And, of course, our honored
guest, Lady Amelia Heartwright.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.087
MISS CHARMING:
What the H?

15:59.800 --> 16:04.931
I've been so lonely here without
other young women to entertain me.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.050
All day, stuck with these men.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.687
And that is my husband.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.807
(BURPS)

16:12.880 --> 16:14.962
Do sit down.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.126
I do hope it will not
rain on us tomorrow.

16:21.240 --> 16:25.564
It would be so lovely to take
a turn around the gardens.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.810
I sure would like you

16:31.000 --> 16:35.289
to turn me upside
down in the garden.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.806
Pardon me?

16:37.000 --> 16:40.209
I think Miss Charming just
means she loves the outdoors.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.367
Right.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.521
Bless.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.240
Do you see something in my eye?

16:46.440 --> 16:49.922

You really are quite a bloke.

16:58.440 --> 17:02.525
It would appear to be my duty
to gaze into your eyes.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.801
I'm a military man,
I'd never shirk my duty.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.208
Allow me, Miss Charming.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.007
Yes. Yes, there is
something there. Fire.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.525

do live up to your name.

your appetite, Mr. Nobley?

17:33.280 --> 17:34.850
Somewhat.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.123
Something on your mind?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.647
Absolutely nothing's
on my mind, thank you.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.684

Yeah?

17:53.880 --> 17:56.929
Why don't you try out
some of that fancy talk?

17:58.320 --> 18:01.767
Mr. Nobley, I hear there is
a ball on our last night.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.966
Do you enjoy dancing?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.161
Not particularly.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.847
AMELIA: (CHUCKLES)
Scandalous.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.164
I am sure you have escorted many a
fine lady on to the dance floor.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.126
ANDREWS: I would say
that manners maketh man.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.965
I look forward to having the
pleasure of standing opposite you.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.607
But dancing is the true hallmark...
You do?

...of a <i>gentilhomme d'honneur.</i>

18:22.920 --> 18:24.968
MR. WATTLESBROOK: Pass the
sheep's eyeballs, will you?

18:25.200 --> 18:28.602
Traditionally, dancing
is a match-making custom.

18:28.680 --> 18:29.727
Oh, yes.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.201
However, it fails
unless both partners

18:32.320 --> 18:34.641
are equally fond of each other.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.411
You could say the same
about any social intercourse.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.885
Intercourse?

18:39.520 --> 18:42.524
Such as talking to someone
or having dinner with them.

18:42.680 --> 18:47.049
Society demands that we engage in a social
intercourse in order to seem courteous.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.525
Yet, in most cases, such
actions are ultimately vulgar.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.728
I really adore conversating.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.291
(ALL CHUCKLING)

18:56.800 --> 18:58.484
Do you really believe,
Mr. Nobley,

18:58.560 --> 19:01.484
that you can know the worth
of a person at a glance?

19:01.760 --> 19:03.649
Can you tell me that
within the first few moments

19:03.720 --> 19:06.166
of meeting each
person in this room,

19:06.400 --> 19:10.086
you didn't form firm opinions
of their character?

19:11.680 --> 19:15.651
Well, it would be a shame if my first
impression of you proved correct.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.925
Well, Miss Erstwhile, I for one
am so pleased you are here.

19:20.120 --> 19:24.728
Another woman who understands,
as I do, the rocky road of love.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.684
Mrs. Wattlesbrook told me
of your tragic story.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.926
What?

19:32.040 --> 19:34.407
I try to learn a great
deal about my clients

19:34.520 --> 19:36.841
so that I can better
prepare for their stay.

19:37.600 --> 19:42.686
You have been unlucky
in love, shall we say?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.489
AMELIA: We most definitely
should say.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.562
At your age,
with no husband, no kinder...

19:52.560 --> 19:53.561
I'm sorry.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.723
The clock is ticking. Tick-took,
tick-took. Oh, bugger.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.930
ANDREWS:
How unfortunate.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.650
Excuse me.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.330
Good duck.

20:06.800 --> 20:11.249
Jane. Jane! Jane.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:11.520 --> 20:15.002
You know, I know how it feels to
be treated badly by stupid men.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.565
I really do.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.569
Jane, come on.
Give me a hug.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.731
Come on. At least it's not
gonna happen at this place.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.321
Besides, you'll feel
totally different tomorrow.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.845
Think about all the people in
the world that hang themselves.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.566
And then the next day,
they feel different,

20:32.680 --> 20:35.251
but there's nothing
they can do about it.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.727
Don't hang yourself, Jane.
Mmm-hmm.

20:38.200 --> 20:42.171
Anyway, if you need anything,
just call me. I'm right down the hall.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.762
Well, actually,
I'm not right down the hall

20:46.480 --> 20:50.326
because you're in the servants' wing.
You're in the creepy tower.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.967
God, sometimes I think
about you here at night.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.969
Must be really scary.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.524
It's okay.
Anyway.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.966
And, Jane,
the maid told me that...

21:04.080 --> 21:07.607
FYI, she said don't
use the chamber pots.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.688
Apparently the toilets
really do flush here,

21:12.320 --> 21:16.120
and they don't know what to do
if it's just piled high.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.046
Right.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.922

he made all his money

21:27.040 --> 21:29.042

no dishonor in surrender

53:56.640 --> 53:57.846
Oh.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.930
Look at you, all moist.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.486
Couldn't you just
use a handkerchief?

54:08.320 --> 54:09.765
Captain.

54:11.800 --> 54:16.522
Perhaps I don't find the
conversation of women to be

54:17.920 --> 54:19.001
stimulating.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.367
I just can't imagine
why you're still single.

54:21.640 --> 54:22.801
Don't see a ring
on your finger.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.086
Nobley.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.491
No, no, no, it's all right.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.608
I asked for it.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.444
I am single
because, apparently,

54:29.520 --> 54:31.602
the only good
men are fictional.

54:31.680 --> 54:32.727
Touché.

54:32.800 --> 54:36.122
And you think that there's
any good women out there?

54:36.200 --> 54:37.770
No, no, no.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.286
They profess
honesty and fidelity,

54:40.360 --> 54:42.681
and while you're away
lecturing in Switzerland,

54:42.760 --> 54:45.081
they run off to
Brazil with your mate!

54:45.160 --> 54:48.004
MISS CHARMING: Get on with
the game, you old windbag!

54:49.320 --> 54:51.004
Someone departing?

54:59.520 --> 55:01.090
That's my trunk.

55:01.160 --> 55:05.688
I have discovered an unmentionable
amongst your things.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.649
Now I believe I
made it perfectly clear

55:07.720 --> 55:09.484
about the rules,
Miss Erstwhile.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.449
We thank you for your stay,
but I regret that

55:11.520 --> 55:13.568
your actions have
forced me to cut it short.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.047
What?

55:15.120 --> 55:16.724
First, that horrid
little song and now this.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.165
You're really
gonna kick me out?

55:18.240 --> 55:20.971
I'm afraid it is
time for you to leave.

55:26.200 --> 55:27.611
Go get 'em, Charming.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.571
I'm so sorry, Jane.

55:31.560 --> 55:35.121
If you would be so kind
as to step on to the cart.

55:38.480 --> 55:39.891
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.450
Please, wait.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.804
This is all my fault.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.929
The modern contraption is mine.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.044
I did not realize I had
it until I first arrived.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.561
And I was so distressed,

55:55.640 --> 55:59.247
Miss Erstwhile kindly offered
to keep it for me

56:00.000 --> 56:03.243
where I would not have to
look upon the eyesore...

56:03.320 --> 56:05.049
MRS. WATTLESBROOK:
Oh. Well,

56:05.120 --> 56:06.360
I see.

56:06.440 --> 56:09.444
So, apparently this appears
to be an accident,

56:10.160 --> 56:14.529
and I think the best thing is we
should pretend like it never happened.

56:19.280 --> 56:21.760
Lady Heartwright,
I do so hope that you will

56:21.840 --> 56:24.241
continue to honor us
with your presence.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.489
Yes. Of course.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.206
Thank you.

56:33.800 --> 56:36.770
I forbid you to leave,
ever, Miss Erstwhile.

56:38.560 --> 56:41.325
We were just getting
to know each other.

56:47.680 --> 56:49.250
Miss Erstwhile.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.082
Yeah. Hi.

56:52.160 --> 56:55.164
Thank you for back there
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

56:55.240 --> 56:56.844
It was a pleasure to save you.

56:56.920 --> 56:59.844
And, please,
you must call me Amelia.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.286
Really?

57:03.000 --> 57:04.331
Make haste.

57:05.400 --> 57:06.640
Quickly.

57:13.640 --> 57:15.005
Amelia?

57:18.520 --> 57:20.921
Dear Jane, now that
we are bosom sisters,

57:21.040 --> 57:23.486
I can at last
confide in someone.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.486
Oh, Janey,

57:28.960 --> 57:31.201
last year, at the ball,

57:31.800 --> 57:33.040
Georgie...

57:34.320 --> 57:36.971
George East and I

57:38.120 --> 57:39.963
became engaged.

57:41.840 --> 57:42.921
It is true.

57:44.520 --> 57:47.490
But alas, he was a poor sailor,

57:48.520 --> 57:52.047
and my father broke off the
engagement without my assent.

57:53.800 --> 57:56.883
If I try to
explain this to him now,

57:57.920 --> 57:59.649
George will think
I only want him back

57:59.720 --> 58:02.485
because he has
become a wealthy captain.

58:04.040 --> 58:06.327
What am I to do?

58:06.400 --> 58:10.291
I sort of thought you were
into Nobley, or is that not...

58:10.560 --> 58:12.130
No, no, no!

58:12.920 --> 58:16.367
Dear Jane, I know
you will help me

58:16.440 --> 58:19.011
find a way to be
alone with Captain East.

58:19.080 --> 58:22.402
I don't really
know what I could do.

58:22.560 --> 58:26.007
It pained me to be so dishonest

58:26.080 --> 58:28.082
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook
back there.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.368
But so long as you

58:33.080 --> 58:35.128
are my dearest friend,

58:36.240 --> 58:38.288
I'll keep your secret.

58:39.440 --> 58:40.566
Oh.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.649
Or should I say secrets?

58:48.560 --> 58:50.801
Farewell, bosom sister.

59:00.080 --> 59:04.608
You know, I think being creative
is a waste of time and money.

59:05.280 --> 59:08.284
AMELIA: Well, I love ribbons
and feathers and colors.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.731
Another blue tit,
please, Miss Charming.

59:11.800 --> 59:14.883
All right, but don't
copy everything I do.

59:14.960 --> 59:16.200
I'll try.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.810
ANDREWS: We're not worthy,
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

59:17.880 --> 59:20.804
Their hearts will positively
burst from the rapture.

59:22.160 --> 59:25.323
I have something of the
utmost urgency to report.

59:26.320 --> 59:27.845
Who's game for
a bit of amusement?

59:27.920 --> 59:30.446
Me! Me! I'm so bored.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.205
Well, well, my cupcake,

59:33.280 --> 59:36.602
Mrs. Wattlesbrook has only
gone and surpassed herself

59:36.680 --> 59:40.321
and has completed
a brilliant theatrical.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.723
You don't look like
you could read or write.

59:42.800 --> 59:43.961
It's just a trifle.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.726
Now, there are six parts.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.610
Three sets of lovers.

59:48.680 --> 59:52.446
And I thought, give us something
to pass the time until the ball,

59:52.520 --> 59:54.648
we could rehearse
it and perform it

59:54.720 --> 59:58.441
for our illustrious
and distinguished authoress.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.090
Now are there any questions?

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.289
No.
No what?

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.488
You can't make me do a play.
It's humiliating.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.609
That's not a question. It's out
of the question, I'm afraid.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.603
I've got a question.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.569
Who gets to pick the lovers?

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.130
Well, I'm thinking
maybe ladies' choice.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.725
You know, maybe alphabetically.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.444

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.490
MISS CHARMING:
Pick wisely, Jane.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.722
I guess Mr. Nobley.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.204
Sorry. Sorry.
That's okay.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.441
Sorry.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.130
Okay, since we have to spend so
much time rehearsing this thing,

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.329
let's just... Let's try
not to annoy each other.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.129
You don't annoy me.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.963
You make me nervous.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.001
So, are you enjoying your stay?

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.083
Really?
We're making small talk now?

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.761
Okay.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.604
Well, the house is amazing, but
it's kind of like a corset.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.648
I like the way it looks,
but it's just...

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.728
Hard to relax in it.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.285
Yes, exactly.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.847
But there is so
much to love here.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.486
I mean, the civility.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.721
The manners.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.768

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.691
The paintings.
They're really...

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.407
Yes, you are an artist.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.567
No, no, no.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.849
The thing is, those aren't real.
They're just stupid sketches.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.809
Who's that?
Exactly.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.723
I'm sorry.
They're not all like that.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.006
No, no. It's a...

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.800
It's a fair likeness.
No apologies needed.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.284
It is curious, however,

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.489
that there are more
of me than anyone else.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.844
I guess I've been trying to
figure you out without much luck.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.609
Surely you've come
to some conclusions.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.448
You're the resident

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.126
Come on,
you're every girl's fantasy.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.844
So I'm your fantasy?

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.200
You play your
character very well.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.841
Right.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.441
Shall we rehearse, then?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.607
Yes.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.450
Are they acting?

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.130
I don't know what's real
or what's not anymore.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.725
I mean, what if
she actually is...

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.285
In love with him?

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.722
Well, don't you think it's possible
to confuse truth with fantasy?

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.407
I mean, what's gonna happen
when the theatrical is over?

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.804
Well, it's a dangerous
kind of game to play.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.805
Don't you think, in their case
anyway, those feelings that,

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.804
you know, that they
can run deeper and...

falling in love, but...

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.766
Yup.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.002
Is that when you
walked out? Just...

Man, what a tart.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.800
Ah.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.645
I have to admit his character
was pretty dreamy.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.731
Yeah.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.085
I wouldn't marry him.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.441
Mainly because
he's got bad knees.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.887
Bad knees?
Did he mention his knees?

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.369
I'm an even bigger nerd
than I thought, though.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.284
I mean, there were
actual moments

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.681
when I really did
believe it was real.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.401
Don't feel bad. I mean, Wattlesbrook
hires the best actors around.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.010
Yeah.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.081
And...

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.162

aren't half bad either.

I could change it.

days in London.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.970

I'm not gonna refuse.

I don't know,
some trousers or...

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.407

less 1800s, ever?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.411
You know, make sure that

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.962
all of them know that
Colonel Andrews is taken.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:35.443
And then I thought I would
ask Miss Wattlesbrook

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.000
if I can buy the place.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.286
You should.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.283
I know. I think I should.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.091
Lizzie, you know, I think...

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.367
I think that Colonel Andrews...

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.764
I think he...
That he might be...

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.649
Perfect for you.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.964
Jane, thank you.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.203
I was so afraid you were gonna
say you thought he was gay.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.971
AMELIA: Adieu.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.485
Farewell.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.804
(LAUGHING)

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.965
God, that was
the best time so far.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.969
Except for the eye gouging.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.491
You're not British?

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.891
Yeah, I know, right?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.607
Well, that's what two years of
private drama tutoring will get you.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.084
You ended up
with Nobley, right?

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.447
He was such a bore,
but, you know...

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.642
He did a good job
of being into you.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.161
He asked me to pretend
your cell phone was mine.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.605
It's so sad when
the trip is over, but,

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.411
frankly, lam dying
for a massage.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.851
My husband's old.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.526
Very old.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.762
And I trust you
discovered rewarding

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.002
romance with one
of the gentlemen?

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.203
Actually, there was someone,

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.443
but not Mr. Nobley,
as you may have intended.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.728
My dear, Henry was
never meant for you.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.889
No, his job was to take care
of Lady Heartwright

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.440
until George East
finished his little show.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.083
No, Martin was scripted for you
right from the very beginning.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.370
No, but he's...

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.361
Martin's a servant.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.804
Well, you've seen my servants.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.280
I had to take him out just for a
little while because things were

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.610
steaming up.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.288
But I had every confidence
that he could woo you back.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.408
And your timing
was very fortunate.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.926
Most of the ladies just
get a litter of kittens.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.010
The foal is the showstopper.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.210
The foal?

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:51.170
I trust you would like
to be on your way, Jane?

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.120
More than ever.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.480
Are you upset?

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.645
No, not at all.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.769
And please don't take it
personally when I shut you down.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.921
Shut me down?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.970
I wasn't the first guest
Mr. Wattlesbrook assaulted, was I?

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.884
I should be able to find
other complaints in no time.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.007
But...

Tied your cravat just a wee
bit too tight, didn't you?

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.522
To be honest, I can't believe
you didn't get Jane.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.046
I mean, she was...
She was anyone's.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.329

Yes.

Yes, no. I'll tell
him right away. Yes.

Yes. Yes, you have a good day.
Of course. Bye-bye.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.847
Martin, that was the old girl
back at the house.

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.604
Appears you're
still on the clock.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.969
You're to go to the airport and
smooth some ruffled feathers pronto.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.528
No rest for the gorgeous.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.809

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.446
Jane. Hey.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.729
I'm really sorry
you didn't know, okay?

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.971
I'd still like to spend
the night together. Yeah?

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.962
You are an actor!

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.210
Hey. Hey, but...

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.965
But you're desperately
in love with me anyway?

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.089
And these sudden passionate feelings
that sent you running after me

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.004
have nothing to do with
Mrs. Wattlesbrook's fear

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.570
that I'm gonna report
her delinquent husband?

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.608
Of course not. Okay?
Right.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.205
I know it all seems shady,
but romances

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.402
have bloomed on stonier ground.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.202
Did Wattlesbrook write that line?
Because we know you didn't.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.484
Okay, she wrote the line. Okay?
Right.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.324
But I'm the one
standing here saying it.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.561
Jane!

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.407
Jolly good, the prefect's
here to save the day.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.926
You can't believe
anything he's said.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.401
I've only just realized now that
Martin was assigned to you.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.289
I know. I... Yeah.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.691
She knows, so...

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.564
So, what are you doing here?

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.008
It's just that
I don't think you understand

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.128
that I'm not
what you think I am.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.168
I have fallen for you.
Right.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.124
My aunt was an actor, sure.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.682
She's an odd woman, I know,
but she was desperate.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.285
What I'm saying is
that your first week

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.890
at the manor was
my first week, too.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.650
I'm not an actor.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.449
Don't listen to him, Janey.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.603
Don't call me Janey!
You were paid to kiss me.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.604
As far as you are concerned,
lam Miss Erstwhile.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.728
I mean, it's so embarrassing.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.643
What, do you keep
a supply of pregnant horses

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.529
just laying
around or something?

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.648
What?
You're not a vet!

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.290
I did a biology
class at school.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.600
Come on, you were acting, too.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.250
Look, before you go
and make your report,

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.764
you should know, gorgeous,

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.128
that what we had was real.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.364
No, you didn't. What we
had was real. Didn't we?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.131
Surely you felt it seeping through
all these costumes and pretense?

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.929
He's still acting.
It's all part of his act.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.804
See the costume?
He's an actor.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.530
You're just jealous,
aren't you?

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.125
Because my aunt
would rather bring in

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.441
a complete novice
than move some

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.331
You're not British either?

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.481
It's part of the Commonwealth.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.681
Couldn't you get
a job on <i>The Hobbit?</i>

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.571

actually strangle him.

No, no, no. I'm...

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.485
Stop! No.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:12.605
No! It is over.
I am done with all of this!

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.324
That felt good. I should have
done that a long time ago.

That's really nice.

I used to think my aunt's
profession was somewhat grotesque,

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.721

I believe we have
that in common.

But all of this is
secondary to the fact

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.608
that I am completely
mad about you.
