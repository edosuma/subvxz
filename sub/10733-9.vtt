00:27.809 --> 00:30.732

a lot more to surprise me.

00:57.633 --> 00:59.897
You know, a little break from real life.

00:59.965 --> 01:02.429
You fight in
real life all the time.

01:02.497 --> 01:07.693
Yeah, but this is in 3d!
Like it's coming right at you.

Boy, did you choose the
wrong guy to pick a fight with.

01:43.281 --> 01:46.880
Come on, Humungousaur!

01:46.949 --> 01:48.515
Stinkfly?

01:48.584 --> 01:52.850
That doesn't even sound like
"Humungousaur".

01:57.886 --> 02:00.518
Stick around for a while, why don't you?

02:09.324 --> 02:12.958
Wow. How'd you do that?

02:21.498 --> 02:23.698
Ew!
All right, fine.

02:23.766 --> 02:27.767
Let's see how you like a
little Humungousaur drool.

02:52.051 --> 02:53.717
What is wrong?

02:53.753 --> 02:56.887
Don't tell me
you didn't hear that.

02:56.922 --> 03:02.958
Okay. I will not.
But what should I have heard?

03:12.933 --> 03:14.799
My apologies.

03:14.834 --> 03:19.335
That almost never happens.
- What? Missing a shot?

03:19.370 --> 03:23.171
Correct.
What is that you are doing?

03:23.207 --> 03:27.008
I'm "there, there"-ing you.
You know, "there, there."

03:27.076 --> 03:29.543
It's supposed to make you feel better.

03:29.611 --> 03:33.446
Why-why would that-that
make anyone feel better?

03:33.515 --> 03:36.448
Hey, I didn't make it up.
It's a thing!

03:36.483 --> 03:39.350
Earthlings sure
do a lot of weird things.

03:39.418 --> 03:42.819
We do not!
Yeah, okay, I guess we do.

03:42.888 --> 03:46.522
Do not feel bad about it.

03:47.658 --> 03:51.993
I don't know why we're wasting
our time searching for that... thing.

03:52.062 --> 03:54.995
I'm telling you, it's
gonna come after me again.

03:55.064 --> 03:57.330
It always does.
We just have to wait for it.

03:57.366 --> 03:59.732
Would it be more
prudent, Ben dude, for us to

03:59.768 --> 04:01.800
take a more proactive
stance at this juncture?

04:01.836 --> 04:03.168
We need to do something.

04:03.204 --> 04:05.737
This is obviously a
creature of some cunning.

04:05.772 --> 04:10.274
It's just a snarling monster.
Many snarling monsters.

04:10.342 --> 04:13.109
When you transformed
into a Lepidopterran...

04:13.178 --> 04:14.244
A Stinkfly?

04:14.279 --> 04:17.245
...your attacker
immediately transformed into

04:17.281 --> 04:19.815
a Buglizard, Stinkfly's
natural predator in the wild.

04:19.884 --> 04:23.186
I never really thought
about my aliens having predators.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.089
It took your changing
into something else, in this

04:26.158 --> 04:28.024
case a Vulpimancer, to defeat it.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.194
That symbol...
kind of like the Omnitrix.

04:31.263 --> 04:35.899
Bet you $14 million
that's how it transforms!

04:37.269 --> 04:40.270
Hey, wait! Stop!
There it is!

04:54.951 --> 04:57.186
<i>I never should have taught you that.</i>

04:57.221 --> 04:59.354
Those sounds
you thought you heard...

04:59.389 --> 05:00.288
I did hear.

05:00.357 --> 05:03.859
...which I did not,
perhaps your Vulpimancer form

05:03.894 --> 05:06.762
allowed you to hear tones
beyond my audible range.

05:06.798 --> 05:10.867
The default form of all
those creatures is a doglike alien.

05:10.902 --> 05:13.503
I wonder if it can hear
what Wildmutt heard?

05:13.572 --> 05:16.640
I bet you $14 million it could.

05:19.244 --> 05:21.378
Grandpa Max?

05:38.763 --> 05:42.399
It's making a break for it!

05:48.940 --> 05:52.775
Hey!
My old hoverboard from when I was a kid.

05:52.811 --> 05:58.849
I can't believe you kept it, Grandpa.
- I kept a lot of things, kiddo.

05:58.884 --> 06:02.986
Gotcha.
- What is that thing?

06:03.055 --> 06:06.523
Lunch. Want some?
- Quartilloptus soup?

06:06.592 --> 06:08.892
Well, you
know your xeno cuisine.

06:08.927 --> 06:11.328
It was my
grandmother's favorite.

06:11.363 --> 06:14.964
Did she make it with
powdered or granulated mealworm?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.902
Huh... I don't remember.
- Well, makes all the difference.

06:20.771 --> 06:23.873
Grandpa!
- Oh, sorry. Here.

06:26.244 --> 06:27.710
No, thanks.

06:27.745 --> 06:31.780
So, this thing that's been attacking
me, it can change alien forms.

06:31.816 --> 06:34.449
And it's got a symbol on it that
looks sort of like the Omnitrix.

06:34.518 --> 06:38.454
Well, your gut instincts
are good, Ben. What do you think?

06:38.489 --> 06:42.725
Well, I was thinking we
should probably be more proactive.

06:43.661 --> 06:46.195
Instead of waiting for
the creature to just randomly

06:46.264 --> 06:48.531
jump me again, we should
be trying to find it.

06:48.566 --> 06:50.800
That's what I said!

06:50.835 --> 06:53.369
Maybe we can trick
this thing into showing itself.

06:53.404 --> 06:56.439
You know, lure it out into the open.
- Good thinking, Ben.

06:56.474 --> 06:59.342
Thanks, Grandpa.
Rook, you coming or what?

07:02.213 --> 07:05.548
<i>Now, just play it cool, and
maybe we can flush out the creature.</i>

07:06.584 --> 07:10.285
It can transform,
so it could be anyone.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.626
He is clean.

07:18.662 --> 07:21.997
What are you doing?
- Eliminating suspects.

07:22.032 --> 07:24.199
We're supposed to be cool!

07:24.267 --> 07:27.436
I was being cool.
- In what universe?!

07:27.471 --> 07:30.372
You have to admit,
that was kind of cool.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.540
Just act normal, will you?

07:32.576 --> 07:35.076
You act normal.
I have a job to do.

07:35.112 --> 07:37.012
We don't have a job to do.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.448
We're not cops.
We're superheroes!

07:39.484 --> 07:43.852
Hardly.
- Excuse me? Do you know ...

07:43.888 --> 07:46.588
How many times you
have saved this universe?

07:46.624 --> 07:47.756
By yourself? Zero.

07:47.825 --> 07:51.460
Every time, there has always been
someone else there to help you.

07:52.730 --> 07:57.298
Heh, like you were there.
- I have been there!

07:57.334 --> 08:00.268
<i>I have already saved you
countless times, and I have only</i>

08:00.303 --> 08:01.469
<i>known you a few weeks.</i>

08:01.504 --> 08:03.471
I'm surprised you made it this far.

08:03.506 --> 08:06.640
You want to start something?
Is that what this is about?

08:10.847 --> 08:14.049
No, I am
going to end something.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.218
Who needs you anyway?!

08:16.253 --> 08:21.223
Some new partner you turned out to be.

08:29.645 --> 08:32.114
Oh, so you're just
gonna ditch me here?

08:32.149 --> 08:32.881
<i>Real mature!</i>

08:35.184 --> 08:38.953
That's more like it.

08:38.989 --> 08:39.587
Hey!

08:39.623 --> 08:43.958
Wait, I think I left my new
Plumber's badge in there.

08:45.529 --> 08:49.664
Oh, however will I be able to
get anything done without it?

08:49.700 --> 08:54.035
Like you are deserving of one.

08:58.908 --> 09:00.708
Nice.

09:14.122 --> 09:18.358
<i>Dr. Psychobos.</i>

09:21.963 --> 09:25.866
Welcome, my friend ...
and I use the term loosely.

09:25.901 --> 09:32.439
There is no need to use
it at all. Just do as we agreed.

09:32.474 --> 09:36.343
Hmm.
Crude, corrupted, incomplete.

09:36.378 --> 09:40.514
But still a suitable partial blueprint.

09:40.550 --> 09:45.987
Pray tell, how did you p-procure
these plans for the Omnitrix?

09:46.022 --> 09:50.925
In battle with Azmuth's pet ...
the human, Ben Tennyson.

09:50.994 --> 09:57.065
His reputation was greatly exaggerated.
- You defeated B-Ben 10?

09:59.303 --> 10:03.639
Your opinion of me is
not my concern, Cerebrocrustacean!

10:03.674 --> 10:08.577
Can that mass of pink pulp you call
a brain build an Omnitrix from this?

10:08.646 --> 10:12.915
Sir ... and I use the term
loosely ... constructing

10:12.951 --> 10:17.653
a Level-20 tech device will be
no more difficult for me than it

10:17.722 --> 10:22.491
would be for a baby G-Galvan
to soil its underg-garments.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.463
Honestly, Galvans and
their superiority complex.

10:27.499 --> 10:32.935
Dullards, the lot of them,
especially that imbecile, Azmuth!

10:32.971 --> 10:37.573
This will finally prove,
once and for all, that

10:37.608 --> 10:40.909
Cerebrocrustaceans are
smarter than G-Galvan!

10:40.944 --> 10:46.315
And that I personally am far
superior to that arrogant Amphibian.

10:46.350 --> 10:51.387
However, while I can create
the hardware for a superior

10:51.422 --> 10:55.591
Omnitrix, I lack the
necessary DNA samples.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.860
Excuses!

10:57.895 --> 11:05.133
Fortunately for you, I know just
the fellow to obtain said DNA for us.

11:05.169 --> 11:10.772
<i>I'm beginning to wonder if you are
the right g-gentleman for this job.</i>

11:10.841 --> 11:14.843
This unique quarry
requires a studied approach.

11:15.712 --> 11:18.680
<i>I could have written a dozen
textbooks in the time you've</i>

11:18.716 --> 11:24.953
<i>taken to study Ben 10!
Obtain the DNA samples from him ... now!</i>

11:24.989 --> 11:28.324
<i>Or consider our ag-greement terminated.</i>

11:28.393 --> 11:31.160
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

11:31.229 --> 11:35.865
Perfectly.
Bring him to me.

11:41.688 --> 11:47.827
He thinks he knows how
to get information out of people?

11:47.863 --> 11:50.831
I'll show him how a real
hero gets things done.

11:59.071 --> 12:01.908
I'm looking for a ravenous alien dog.

12:01.944 --> 12:05.345
Don't suppose you know
where I can find one, do you?

12:05.380 --> 12:07.013
Try the pound.

12:07.049 --> 12:13.019
This one changes forms, causes
mass destruction, usually tries to kill me.

12:13.088 --> 12:14.254
Try a psychiatrist.

12:15.290 --> 12:16.490
Don't you know who I am?

12:16.558 --> 12:19.659
Uh, not unless you want
an Andorian turglbaster.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.194
Then you're my customer.

12:21.230 --> 12:29.536
If not, you're just taking up space
where paying customers could be.

12:29.572 --> 12:31.040
Ugh.

12:34.076 --> 12:37.210
Rook made this look so easy.

12:40.314 --> 12:45.385
How do you lure a vicious
alien dog out? Baco-treats?

12:45.453 --> 12:49.021
Rawhide chew toys?
Giant alien tennis balls?

12:50.091 --> 12:55.562
Hey, buddy, want to
keep it down to a dull roar?

13:02.503 --> 13:03.938
Pakmar?!

13:03.974 --> 13:07.676
Ooh, a customer!
Oh. It's you.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.413
You blew up my last
place ... Pakmar's place.

13:11.448 --> 13:14.683
Go away now!
- Yeah, um, sorry about that?

13:14.719 --> 13:18.220
Look, I'm hoping you have a
special kind of alien dog whistle.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.690
You actually want to
buy something from Pakmar?

13:21.759 --> 13:24.493
No, no.
I just want to hear it.

13:24.528 --> 13:27.128
You hear it, you buy it!
- Great!

13:27.164 --> 13:29.798
Now I need you to blow
each whistle for me.

13:29.866 --> 13:32.700
But not yet. Okay, Omnitrix.

13:32.769 --> 13:36.070
Give me Humungousaur.

13:44.813 --> 13:46.079
You eat it, you buy it!

13:58.626 --> 14:00.360
You stomp it, you buy it!

14:00.395 --> 14:03.796
Wow. At this rate,
Pakmar will be able to retire.

14:03.832 --> 14:06.432
Good customer.

14:10.671 --> 14:13.705
That's it!
- What's it? There's no it.

14:13.741 --> 14:15.007
Pakmar did nothing.

14:26.786 --> 14:29.056
You!
- Me?!

14:29.091 --> 14:34.361
Out! Out of Pakmar's new place while
Pakmar still has some new place left!

14:50.209 --> 14:51.743
Ben Tennyson.

14:51.812 --> 14:54.546
Well, what do
you know. It worked.

14:54.581 --> 14:59.117
Been trolling undertown using myself
as bait, and lookie what I caught.

14:59.153 --> 15:06.458
So, you gonna let your puppy keep
fighting your battles for you?

15:09.330 --> 15:12.764
No, I'll
take care of you myself.

15:28.274 --> 15:31.609
Ha, I don't think we've
been properly introduced.

15:31.677 --> 15:36.347
I'm ben Tennyson, the kid who's
about to kick your sorry butt.

15:36.382 --> 15:37.548
And you are?

15:37.617 --> 15:39.817
The last
thing you will ever see.

15:40.786 --> 15:45.789
Ha, man, if I had a nickel for
every time I heard that, I'd ... ugh!

15:54.066 --> 15:55.566
Gullible.

15:57.235 --> 16:00.002
Like simple prey.

16:04.242 --> 16:06.542
Ohh, why, Omnitrix?
Why?!

16:06.578 --> 16:09.646
Is this supposed to be funny?
'Cause I'm not laughing.

16:12.851 --> 16:18.154
Time to make like
a tree and get out of here!

16:20.692 --> 16:23.460
Fetch.

16:46.618 --> 16:49.887
Aww. Too bad, so sad.

17:03.401 --> 17:06.335
You can't fly
from me, little birdie.

17:08.739 --> 17:11.173
Whoa!

17:15.078 --> 17:18.346
So, any last words?

17:22.419 --> 17:25.987
How about..."buh-bye!"

17:33.262 --> 17:35.230
Fight back all you want.

17:35.266 --> 17:37.532
There is a predator for every
kind of prey.

18:19.475 --> 18:22.343
Now who's
got nowhere to run, huh?

18:22.378 --> 18:27.481
Not so funny when the shoe's on
the other... pseudopod, or whatever.

18:27.550 --> 18:32.220
I've defeated Vilgax the
conqueror, Dagon the destroyer.

18:32.289 --> 18:34.622
What makes you think
you're any better?

18:34.658 --> 18:36.624
Experience.

18:51.274 --> 18:55.843
Well, this might be a problem.
Ugh, come on, new Omnitrix!

18:55.912 --> 18:59.179
Would it kill you to
give me Humungousaur?

18:59.215 --> 19:01.315
Just this once?!

19:02.952 --> 19:04.485
Whoa!

19:04.520 --> 19:07.054
This is a new one.
Um, well, what can it do?

19:07.122 --> 19:10.957
I got to have something going for
me other than the power of cuteness.

19:13.128 --> 19:14.760
Far too easy.

19:23.503 --> 19:24.704
Hold still, vermin.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.673
I couldn't, even if I wanted to!

19:27.709 --> 19:29.142
Whoa!

19:47.864 --> 19:51.400
Look out, fang-face!
I'm coming through!

19:51.435 --> 19:57.073
Want some of this?

19:58.443 --> 20:00.610
I didn't mean literally.

20:03.682 --> 20:04.814
Dude!

20:22.600 --> 20:27.068
Aha!
Not so tough now, are you?

20:27.104 --> 20:31.239
Whoa!

20:31.274 --> 20:34.442
Too bad Rook wasn't
here to see that shot.

20:41.784 --> 20:45.020
Okay, Rook.
Anytime you want to...

20:45.089 --> 20:47.823
get over yourself and...
come help me.

21:03.475 --> 21:07.377
What's the matter?
Can't finish what you started?

21:07.413 --> 21:09.913
Oh, I fully intend to finish.

21:09.949 --> 21:17.655
I was just letting my
pet here play a bit.

21:28.368 --> 21:30.137
No.

21:33.206 --> 21:36.307
Yes.
