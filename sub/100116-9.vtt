WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.587
Previously on Legacies...
LANDON: I learned today

00:03.587 --> 00:04.963
that no matter how hard we try,

00:04.963 --> 00:06.173
we can't solve
the monster problem.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.675
So I have to leave Mystic Falls

00:08.675 --> 00:10.219
knowing that they'll follow me.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.179
Every monster
that comes out of that portal

00:12.179 --> 00:13.305
wants him for Malivore.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.057
I am not here for Landon Kirby.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.768
You serve a new master.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.519
(laughing)

00:23.523 --> 00:24.816
ALARIC:
And who the hell are you?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.360
NECROMANCER:
Bringer of life and death.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.112
The cursed king
of the underworld.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.657
The Necromancer!

00:35.118 --> 00:38.288
(rumbling)
Oh, the knife is destroyed.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.458
One lock is released.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.546
And with it...

00:46.546 --> 00:48.423
so am I.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.473
(grunts)

01:04.773 --> 01:06.358
(grunts)

01:06.358 --> 01:07.985
Hey. You can't sleep here.

01:07.985 --> 01:12.030
I wasn't sleeping,
you thundering dolt!

01:13.031 --> 01:14.950
I was magically transported

01:14.950 --> 01:15.993
here to this...

01:19.246 --> 01:20.580
What is this place?

01:20.580 --> 01:21.915
It's a strip mall.
And you're gonna have

01:21.915 --> 01:23.667
to magically transport
somewhere else,

01:23.667 --> 01:25.711
'cause it's also
private property.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.920
Worm!

01:26.920 --> 01:30.924
Do you have any idea
to whom you speak?

01:30.924 --> 01:34.720
I am the...

01:34.720 --> 01:36.763
Necro...

01:36.763 --> 01:38.765
Oh!

01:38.765 --> 01:40.392
Oh!
(breathing shakily)

01:41.435 --> 01:43.395
What did Malivore

01:43.395 --> 01:45.480
do to me?
No idea. But
if you don't

01:45.480 --> 01:47.107
leave here,
I'm-a have to call the cops.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.109
Silence!

01:51.194 --> 01:52.779
My powers.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.364
He took them.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.700
Oh, but we had a deal!

01:56.700 --> 01:57.868
He promised me!

01:57.868 --> 01:59.995
Okay, cops it is.
(phone dialing)

01:59.995 --> 02:02.998
Wait. Tell me.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.544
Am I in peace?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.796
Buddy, you're in Texas.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.216
(sighs)

02:19.389 --> 02:21.266
HOPE:
Starting over.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.935
In theory, it's simple.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.023
You put the past behind you,

02:28.023 --> 02:31.651
take what you learned
and begin again.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.658
But it's not as easy
as it sounds.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.245
Moving on
means letting things go.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.166
Things that are familiar,
easy, safe.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.252
Things that matter.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.838
Someone once said
you can't go home again.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.383
I hope like hell
they were wrong.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.848
Oh.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.142
It's just you.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.812
Alyssa, what's all this?

03:06.812 --> 03:10.273
I moved in while you were
forgotten or whatever.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.900
Your side's over there.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.694
I usually have a single.
Which is what

03:14.694 --> 03:16.696
I had until this exact moment.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.282
I go to bed at 10:00,
so no late-night visitors.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.534
And I don't want ants,

03:20.534 --> 03:23.036
so no eating in the room.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.416
Later, roomie.
(coughs)

03:27.416 --> 03:29.418
(sighs)

03:29.418 --> 03:30.877
(scoffs)

03:35.132 --> 03:36.466
(sighs)

03:36.466 --> 03:38.301
You're late for class.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.928
Or are you lost?
Uh, both.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.305
Apparently, everything changed
when I was gone.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.724
Where's spell lab?
No idea.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.810
I'm a little out of the
loop myself. (chuckles)

03:46.810 --> 03:49.980
I just like to stride
confidently and, uh, nod

03:49.980 --> 03:51.648
in hopes that people
don't figure that out.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.234
But speaking of being
out of the loop,

03:54.234 --> 03:55.986
Lizzie and Josie
are avoiding me.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.321
Why? What's up?
(chuckles):
I wouldn't know.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.449
Things are still awkward
between me and Josie.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.492
I mean, I thought
they were okay.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.618
It's just bad again.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.370
Yeah, well, knowing
you and Landon

04:05.370 --> 04:08.206
are together and seeing it
are two very different things.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.666
I just wish there was
something I could do.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.294
You just have to give
her some time, you know?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.546
Things will go back
to normal soon enough.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.839
I hope.
(chuckles)

04:15.839 --> 04:17.048
Yeah.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.884
Spell lab.
Oh!

04:19.426 --> 04:20.927
Ric.
Mm.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.429
So, I touched base
with Caroline.
Mm.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.514
She wants us to track
down the real Vardemus

04:24.514 --> 04:26.808
and make sure he's okay.
(exhales) I'm more concerned
about the fake Vardemus

04:26.808 --> 04:29.186
enrolling a 500-year-old vampire
in my absence.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.854
Technically, Sebastian
was in a coffin

04:30.854 --> 04:32.689
for 483 of them, but yeah.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.399
Yeah, but we have
our recruitment bylaws.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.734
Which Vardemus revised.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.861
Not to mention
a lengthy admission process.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.237
Which he waived.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.406
Do you know that he got rid
of the espresso machine?

04:41.406 --> 04:44.409
He was more of a tea person.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.454
Look, I need to know more
about this Sebastian.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.705
We can't blindly let him in here

04:48.705 --> 04:50.123
without knowing more
about his history.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.750
You're right. I'll have

04:51.750 --> 04:53.502
my intern do a deep dive
into the historical records

04:53.502 --> 04:55.128
to see if there's
any trace of him.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.130
You have an intern?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.592
Dad. Hi.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.302
Liz-bear.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.388
You're late for class.
Oh.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.266
Um, I... I got distracted,

05:08.266 --> 05:09.768
and I lost track of time.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.853
But it was... it was dumb

05:11.853 --> 05:15.607
and irresponsible,
and it will

05:15.607 --> 05:18.193
never happen again.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.808
(sighs)

05:56.565 --> 05:59.568
Hear me, insect.

05:59.568 --> 06:03.363
This is the master of death
calling to you.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.990
Rise.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.032
MAN:
Uh...

06:06.032 --> 06:08.410
Ted? Got a sec?

06:11.663 --> 06:12.789
You know, it's crazy hat day,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.125
and you're not wearing
a crazy hat.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.377
How could I make
such a mistake?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.629
Look.
(clears throat)

06:19.629 --> 06:22.424
I don't think of myself
as your boss.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.758
I think of myself
as your friend.

06:23.758 --> 06:27.596
And bottom line is I need
my friends to be on time,

06:27.596 --> 06:28.638
participate in spirit days

06:28.638 --> 06:30.515
and, most of all,

06:30.515 --> 06:31.766
sing...

06:31.766 --> 06:33.518
when someone puts money
in the jar.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.145
Think you can do that?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.688
Sure.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.189
Gary.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.774
(clicks tongue)

06:43.153 --> 06:45.488
(hits counter)
Don't let him get to you, man.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.490
No one gets to me.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.742
I just get so mad, you know?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.076
One time he pissed me off,

06:50.076 --> 06:51.661
I toasted his phone
with the waffle cones.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.704
That was you?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.831
That masterstroke provided me

06:54.831 --> 06:56.708
the only smile I've
had this month.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.627
Sick.
(exhales)

06:58.627 --> 07:00.337
Chad.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.340
I'm the...

07:04.633 --> 07:07.010
Ted.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.429
I'm Ted.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.277
(clears throat)

07:24.277 --> 07:25.362
Hey, Jo.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.988
Uh, what's up?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.198
Hey.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.240
I got you some brownies.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.325
Um, I have to run, though.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.285
I love you.
(chuckles)
Love you, too.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.579
(clears throat)

07:34.579 --> 07:36.873
Sebastian. Sit.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.126
(sighs)

07:43.129 --> 07:45.423
Sebastian, our
school was founded

07:45.423 --> 07:47.425
to keep young supernaturals

07:47.425 --> 07:49.344
safe from the world.
Well,

07:49.344 --> 07:52.555
my impression is that it exists
to keep the world safe from us.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.141
It's a balance.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.685
Look,

07:56.685 --> 07:58.853
I'm not convinced
you belong here.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.856
We don't admit vampires
over the age of 17.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.316
But...
(sighs)

08:03.316 --> 08:06.653
Since you've been
stuck in that coffin,

08:06.653 --> 08:09.072
I might make an exception

08:09.072 --> 08:11.616
if you pass our tests.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.243
So today you will spend time

08:13.243 --> 08:15.078
with the various
factions. The goal

08:15.078 --> 08:18.832
is to see if you can
control your basic urges.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.584
You know who would be
an ideal guide

08:21.584 --> 08:23.712
is your daughter Elizabeth.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.756
You stay away from my daughters.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.510
Consider this
your one warning.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.597
Well, if I'm so dangerous,

08:34.597 --> 08:37.225
who shall be
administering this test?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.436
The only student who'll
come back to life

08:39.436 --> 08:41.396
if you kill him.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.152
Pretty much everyone
gets along here.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.529
Um, there are other
supernatural schools, I guess,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.990
but we're the only one that
integrates all three factions.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.367
It can be a little overwhelming
for new students.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.078
'Tis not three factions.
'Tis four.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.623
Tell me, what powers
does a phoenix possess?

09:00.623 --> 09:03.793
Surely, it's more than
merely dying often.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.044
That's, uh...

09:05.044 --> 09:06.755
That's kind of it.
I'm cool with it, though.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.048
I mean, everyone else has
the hero angle covered here.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.925
I'm better as a sidekick.
Mm.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.594
I imagine it would be nice

09:12.594 --> 09:15.847
not to be killed
quite so easily.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.641
Sorry about last
time, by the way.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.393
No worries.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.480
You're not the first person
around here who's killed me.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.565
Hey.
Hi.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.775
How's it going? What-What's up?

09:26.775 --> 09:27.776
(Josie clears throat)

09:27.776 --> 09:29.277
The usual. Getting rid

09:29.277 --> 09:31.988
of magical evidence before
my dad overreacts.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.824
Sure.
Anyways, see you later.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.118
SEBASTIAN:
Is this what they call

09:37.118 --> 09:38.995
"teen drama"?
Shut up. Hey.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.123
Hey.
How's it... Uh, hi.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.584
Josie didn't leave
because of me, right?
I hope not.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.503
Um, you're all moved in?
Yeah.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.798
Um, Alyssa Chang generously
gave me back 20% of my room.

09:49.798 --> 09:50.924
Plenty of space

09:50.924 --> 09:52.801
for the nine things I still own.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.971
What's going on?
Uh, Dr. Saltzman
is having me test

09:56.971 --> 09:59.599
Sebastian here to see
if he can stay at the school.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.976
Call if you need backup?

10:01.976 --> 10:05.897
I can assure you, I will
be on my best behavior.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.776
Even a sidekick can handle me.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.278
NECROMANCER:
This is a charade.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.782
We shouldn't be here cleaning
congealed dairy and sugar.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.909
We should be kings.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.496
People should tremble
at the sound of our names.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.747
Preach.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.957
Power, Chad!

10:23.957 --> 10:25.708
That's what
I'm talking about.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.753
Real power.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.713
Cash money.
No!

10:30.713 --> 10:33.550
Not money.
Any fool can get rich.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.717
Oh, right.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.845
Necromancy.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.264
Dominion over life and death.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.516
The ability to bend

10:41.516 --> 10:42.767
the universe to your will.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.018
Like that sweet gig
you used to have.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.771
Walking around,
being your own boss,

10:46.771 --> 10:48.565
raising people from the dead.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.859
You believe my story?

10:50.859 --> 10:51.985
Of course.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.611
I'm into all that stuff
the government

10:53.611 --> 10:56.739
doesn't want us to know
about-- UFOs, lizard men,

10:56.739 --> 10:58.157
Bigfoot.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.660
I just wish I could've
seen you kick ass

11:00.660 --> 11:01.661
back in the day.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.788
Maybe you're not too late.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.256
Rise.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.887
Rise.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.682
(short laugh)

11:24.893 --> 11:26.519
(laughing)
Did you just...?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.937
I've been practicing.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.316
Now you've witnessed
my sorcery, I have one question

11:31.316 --> 11:32.317
for you, Chad.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.360
Will you be my acolyte?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.487
Hell yeah.
What-What's an acolyte?

11:36.487 --> 11:37.822
It's a fancy word
for "follower."

11:37.822 --> 11:38.865
Where are we going?

11:38.865 --> 11:39.991
We're going back to the way

11:39.991 --> 11:40.992
things used to be.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.952
Because somehow...

11:42.952 --> 11:46.748
I'm gonna become
the Necromancer again.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.880
Rise, feline.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.380
Rise.

12:02.260 --> 12:05.260
(whispering):
How long's it supposed to take?

12:05.260 --> 12:08.350
(groans)
I don't know, Chad.

12:08.350 --> 12:09.730
Cockroaches
are child's play

12:09.730 --> 12:11.440
compared to more
complex animals.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.850
Ev-Eventually you work your
way back up to humans, right?

12:13.850 --> 12:16.110
All in good time,
my acolyte.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.150
Malivore took my powers,

12:18.150 --> 12:20.490
but he couldn't
take my birthright--

12:20.490 --> 12:22.910
a propensity for magic.

12:22.910 --> 12:28.200
Now I need to rebuild
my skills, step by step.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.080
Why do you think Malivore
did this to you?

12:34.080 --> 12:37.040
Well, if you were
promised peace,

12:37.040 --> 12:38.250
why did he send you here?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.840
I'm sure he was
jealous of my power.

12:40.840 --> 12:45.590
That I was the only one who
was smart enough to outfox...

12:45.590 --> 12:47.010
Oh, that's strange.

12:47.010 --> 12:50.020
I can't remember
who I stole the knife from.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.980
I mean, I remember the man
with the anger issues

12:51.980 --> 12:53.850
and the impressive jawline,

12:53.850 --> 12:57.440
but there was someone else.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.480
(cat meows)

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
(gasps)
Ah.

13:08.990 --> 13:11.870
(screaming)

13:13.000 --> 13:14.420
(screaming)

13:17.250 --> 13:19.250
(indistinct crowd chatter)

13:19.250 --> 13:22.920
So you get to see all of these
amazing alternate universes,

13:22.920 --> 13:26.260
but then, eventually, everything
just resets back to normal,

13:26.260 --> 13:29.140
and the heroes don't even
remember any of it?

13:29.890 --> 13:31.720
Lame.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.390
(laughs, sighs)

13:34.390 --> 13:36.810
I got to say, I'm surprised
you wanted to hang out.

13:36.810 --> 13:39.020
I thought you weren't gonna talk
to me ever again.

13:39.020 --> 13:41.190
Gaslighting me was
a reprehensible act,

13:41.190 --> 13:44.990
but keep supplying me
with superheroes in spandex,

13:44.990 --> 13:46.860
and we'll call it a wash.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.660
(sighs)
Okay.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.080
Come clean.
You-you hate

13:56.080 --> 14:00.040
all this nerdy stuff.
Okay, fine.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.880
I'm trying not to have sex
with Sebastian again.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.300
I thought you hated him, too.

14:04.300 --> 14:05.920
I did. I mean, I do. I just...

14:05.920 --> 14:08.590
I'm also incredibly
turned on by him.

14:08.590 --> 14:10.970
Oh, I don't need to hear
any of this.
So we're-- we've been

14:10.970 --> 14:12.510
having a lot of sex.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.560
And-and my mind is
telling me to stop,

14:14.560 --> 14:16.770
but apparently my body
didn't get the message about

14:16.770 --> 14:18.020
how much of a feminist I am.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.980
So I'm trying to avoid him

14:19.980 --> 14:23.280
until he is inevitably
kicked out of school.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.320
And comic books are the literary
equivalent of a cold shower.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.110
That's actually a graphic novel.

14:28.110 --> 14:31.160
Okay, yeah, that's good.
Keep saying stuff like that.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.240
No. This is
a seminal work of fiction,

14:34.240 --> 14:37.660
not something to run
your horny clock out.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.880
(siren wailing in distance)

14:45.050 --> 14:47.050
(clatters)
(burps)

14:47.050 --> 14:49.760
Come on, man.
Get... get up!

14:49.760 --> 14:51.680
You-you can't just
mope around like this.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.060
You-you want to do
magic or something?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.100
Hmm. Pointless!

14:56.100 --> 14:57.390
Ah, I was
foolish to think

14:57.390 --> 14:59.650
I could reclaim my former glory.

14:59.650 --> 15:01.560
It took me centuries

15:01.560 --> 15:04.150
to become the Necromancer
in the first place!

15:04.150 --> 15:05.650
You can't give up
on your dreams, man!

15:05.650 --> 15:07.030
You should fight him.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.400
We both should fight him.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.030
Where is Malivore right now?

15:12.030 --> 15:15.950
He's a sentient pit
of black goo in rural Georgia.

15:15.950 --> 15:19.080
Okay. Well,
then we pee on him.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.960
Yeah. We take a leak
right in that pit.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.590
That'll show him who's boss.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.590
Yeah.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.380
Yeah!

15:30.380 --> 15:32.340
(tennis shoes squeaking,
ball bouncing)

15:32.340 --> 15:33.930
(indistinct chatter)

15:33.930 --> 15:36.100
(grunts)
JED:
Hey.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.060
Have you heard from Raf?
Uh, he's staying
with his dad for a bit.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.520
I think it'll be good for him.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.190
Tell, uh, Captain Cheekbones

15:45.190 --> 15:46.900
he's got a weird
staring problem.

15:49.150 --> 15:50.200
(laughs airily)

15:50.200 --> 15:51.700
LANDON:
It's okay. Lots of vampires

15:51.700 --> 15:53.740
can't be around one werewolf,
let alone this many.

15:53.740 --> 15:56.200
Most vampires can't
control their emotions.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
Downside of all
the power, I guess.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.370
I think having no power
would be far more concerning.

16:01.370 --> 16:04.130
You know, a little
blonde birdie told me that

16:04.130 --> 16:06.130
Clarke almost
killed Hope.

16:06.130 --> 16:09.420
She was powerless and
running for her life,

16:09.420 --> 16:11.260
and you were...
you were...

16:11.260 --> 16:13.260
you were searching
for yourself?

16:13.260 --> 16:14.640
I was trying
to keep everyone safe.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.760
And did it work?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.140
Mm. Not that you
could have done

16:18.140 --> 16:19.600
anything anyway, of course,

16:19.600 --> 16:21.730
but if the girl that
I had loved was in danger,

16:21.730 --> 16:24.560
I would want to be
able to protect her.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.740
He'll play.

Oh, Malivore!

17:22.700 --> 17:24.620
You have visitors.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.130
We brought you
a little pre...

17:27.130 --> 17:29.290
(unzips)

17:31.920 --> 17:35.300
Pit is empty.
Someone closed

17:35.300 --> 17:36.390
the portal. (laughs)

17:36.390 --> 17:38.640
Malivore was defeated.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.850
You were right.

17:40.850 --> 17:44.140
And if Malivore can be beaten,
anything's possible.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.020
(laughing):
Oh.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.230
I can fulfill my destiny.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.230
That's what
I'm talking about!

17:51.230 --> 17:52.610
Yeah.

17:52.610 --> 17:55.610
So-so what do we do next?
How do we level you up?

17:55.610 --> 17:58.200
Oh, dark sorcery requires
a steep price

17:58.200 --> 18:00.700
to be paid
in exchange for power.

18:00.700 --> 18:04.830
I'm afraid I must sacrifice
that which I hold most dear.

18:04.830 --> 18:08.130
What's that?
The only thing
in this wretched existence

18:08.130 --> 18:10.290
I've grown fond of.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.590
(both grunt)

18:29.860 --> 18:32.070
(opera playing)

19:06.680 --> 19:08.270
NECROMANCER:
Rise.

19:08.270 --> 19:11.980
Come back to this plane.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.780
There you are.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.990
(laughing)

19:20.990 --> 19:23.330
Dude.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.330
What happened to your face?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.160
This is my true face.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.620
Behold

19:28.620 --> 19:30.540
the mark of the underworld.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.170
Wait. Did you kill me?
Technically.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.420
But I always intended
to raise you from perdition.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.460
What? Shouldn't you have
warned me or something?

19:36.460 --> 19:38.420
Uh, you're missing
the headline, Chad.

19:38.420 --> 19:42.720
I can now raise... humans.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.640
Well, I'm not a zombie,
though, right?

19:44.640 --> 19:48.560
You can't, like,
control me?
Try this on.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.270
What's this?
Iconic!

19:50.270 --> 19:52.810
I must become a mysterious
symbol that both

19:52.810 --> 19:55.230
terrifies
and intrigues my acolytes.

19:55.230 --> 19:58.190
Acolytes, plural?
Fear not. It's all part
of my master plan.

19:58.190 --> 20:01.360
I'll catch you
up on the way.
Where are we going?

20:01.360 --> 20:04.870
To a place of immense
magical energy, a place where

20:04.870 --> 20:08.040
so many people have died,
the very ground courses

20:08.040 --> 20:10.670
with blood and power.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.790
Have you ever been to Virginia?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.210
ALYSSA:
Hey, Greasley,
I heard he's moving in

20:17.210 --> 20:19.340
on your girl.

20:19.340 --> 20:22.140
Is that him?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.430
Well, she's not my girl,

20:24.430 --> 20:26.470
and can I sit with you
and the witches?

20:26.470 --> 20:28.020
I've had enough
of vampires today.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.640
ALYSSA:
Oh, you're our favorite vampire.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.520
If you hate him, we hate him.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.270
He makes us look bad
with his old-ass Dracula ways.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.200
So run him out. He's doing
his behavioral tests.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.240
Make him fail.
How?

20:44.240 --> 20:46.280
Find me a Band-Aid, will you?

20:48.700 --> 20:50.410
So, you get along
with the wolves.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.790
Now we just have to see if you
fit in with the vampires here.

20:52.790 --> 20:54.960
Uh, we can hang out
while they eat.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.340
Or drink, I guess.

20:56.340 --> 20:57.750
Animal blood, of course.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.300
Of course.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.420
(plate shatters)

21:01.340 --> 21:02.680
It slipped.

21:05.510 --> 21:07.890
(vampires hissing)

21:10.480 --> 21:13.940
Code red.
Vamps, clear out. Now!

21:15.610 --> 21:18.520
Jed, calm your pack down.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.530
(pack snarling)

21:19.530 --> 21:21.990
Wolves, follow me.

21:29.870 --> 21:32.120
(exhales deeply)

21:35.290 --> 21:37.250
Breathe, Milton, breathe!

21:37.250 --> 21:40.340
Focus only on the
sound of my voice.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.260
Breathe! Breathe.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.010
Breathe.
(Milton shuddering)

21:44.010 --> 21:46.510
Breathe.

21:46.510 --> 21:49.350
The urge will pass.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.810
I'm sorry.

21:56.770 --> 21:58.360
I'm sorry.

22:02.650 --> 22:05.990
The witch, she broke
that plate on purpose.

22:05.990 --> 22:10.120
Between her and your...
budding Ripper,

22:10.120 --> 22:14.330
are you sure it is me that
you should be worried about?

22:26.340 --> 22:28.840
(chanting in foreign language)

22:38.100 --> 22:40.480
(panting heavily)

22:46.660 --> 22:49.070
This is it.

22:49.070 --> 22:53.580
A site of almost
unlimited magical power.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.870
(chuckles)
Huh.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.460
I thought it'd be bigger.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.790
Chad, please!

23:00.670 --> 23:02.880
I will consecrate the ground.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.550
Then we will set a trap
for the next hapless soul

23:05.550 --> 23:06.970
who wanders through.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.640
You never said
anything about that.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.680
To seal my bond to this place

23:10.680 --> 23:12.720
and draw from the mystical
hot spot beneath,

23:12.720 --> 23:14.730
I'll need to murder.

23:14.730 --> 23:16.440
A murder of pure,

23:16.440 --> 23:19.100
unbridled cruelty.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.730
(laughs)

23:42.710 --> 23:44.210
What's that?

23:44.210 --> 23:48.260
Um, an assignment that
Clarke had me working on

23:48.260 --> 23:52.220
when he was pretending
to be Headmaster Vardemus.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.510
Well, Clarke's dead,
so I'm pretty sure

23:54.510 --> 23:55.890
you don't have
to turn that in.

23:55.890 --> 23:58.560
I was actually just working
on getting rid of it.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.440
So, should be easy.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.900
Magic nullification?

24:01.900 --> 24:03.820
Those are advanced
chain spells.

24:03.820 --> 24:05.980
You would need
another witch.

24:05.980 --> 24:07.240
What kind of assignment was it?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.610
I can help.

24:09.610 --> 24:10.860
I'm sure we can
handle it.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.490
I mean, it could be
good practice for us.

24:14.450 --> 24:16.290
Have fun.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.870
Thank you.

24:20.870 --> 24:22.830
Uh, but I actually
don't need any help, so...

24:22.830 --> 24:25.420
Lizzie told me
about the Sandclock.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.590
She thought I could help.

24:27.590 --> 24:29.470
How?

24:29.470 --> 24:32.680
My friend Vincent told me
a story about Mora Miseriums

24:32.680 --> 24:34.100
that hold the effects
of black magic,

24:34.100 --> 24:37.350
and how dangerous they can be
if they break.

24:37.350 --> 24:40.810
Look, you can't nullify
the black magic inside,

24:40.810 --> 24:44.440
but you can put a protective
barrier around the outside.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.900
And I know a good spell
for that.

24:55.990 --> 24:59.450
Oh... they have a Mora Miserium.

24:59.450 --> 25:03.580
In one stroke,
it could restore my power.

25:04.540 --> 25:05.750
Yeah.

25:05.750 --> 25:08.800
You recall the girl
who suddenly returned

25:08.800 --> 25:10.470
to my memory, the Tribrid?

25:10.470 --> 25:12.470
Yeah, she'll be an obstacle.

25:12.470 --> 25:15.970
We may have to kill her.

25:15.970 --> 25:18.520
Might as well kill all her
friends while we're at it, eh?

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
Yeah.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.690
Okay, this is the final
part of the test:

25:25.690 --> 25:28.020
hanging with the witches.

25:28.020 --> 25:32.780
Um, I'm warning you,
don't push any buttons.

25:32.780 --> 25:35.740
Or you'll do what,
die all over me?

25:35.740 --> 25:38.330
It's not me you should
be worried about.

25:38.330 --> 25:42.000
Will you relax?
Witches love me.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.750
(indistinct chatter)

25:44.750 --> 25:46.080
Hello, Elizabeth.

25:47.540 --> 25:50.380
Oh... hey.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.010
Oh, you again.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.180
I must say you just
heal quickly.

25:54.180 --> 25:58.050
Right? It's like
magic or something.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.930
And what magic is that
crystal ball for?

25:59.930 --> 26:01.480
Empathic trances.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.850
It lets us read feelings
that are buried deep down.

26:03.850 --> 26:06.770
Can we read yours? Vampires have
heightened emotions.

26:06.770 --> 26:07.690
It'll be a total rush.

26:07.690 --> 26:09.690
I, for one, would like that.

26:09.690 --> 26:10.940
Then of course.

26:10.940 --> 26:14.320
I do love a good parlor trick.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.630
I sense...

26:28.880 --> 26:30.130
...fear.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.010
The modern world is
terrifying to you.

26:33.010 --> 26:35.680
You're afraid they won't let you
stay here at the school.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.010
That's not true.
You're afraid

26:37.010 --> 26:38.640
they're gonna find out
all the things you've done

26:38.640 --> 26:41.640
and throw you away, like trash
off the side of a boat.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.680
Stop.
Maybe we should...

26:42.680 --> 26:43.770
You know Lizzie's
better than you

26:43.770 --> 26:45.770
and that you don't deserve her.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.270
(grunts)

26:51.690 --> 26:52.690
(high-pitched tone sounding)

26:52.690 --> 26:54.320
(pained crying)

26:57.240 --> 26:59.870
Stop! Stop!
Let him go.

26:59.870 --> 27:02.290
(panting)

27:22.220 --> 27:25.230
(panting)

27:34.900 --> 27:38.030
Have you come to gloat, Landon?

27:39.320 --> 27:42.450
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

27:42.450 --> 27:45.450
The fundamental truth
is that I am not.

27:45.450 --> 27:49.830
When I was eight years old,
my parents, they sold me

27:49.830 --> 27:51.960
to a merchant ship.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.960
I hated that life,

27:53.960 --> 27:56.800
so every port we
sailed to, I ran away.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.720
But the crew,

27:58.720 --> 28:02.220
they always found me again.

28:02.220 --> 28:06.730
And they devised
very special punishments for me.

28:09.060 --> 28:12.820
This is a cruel world,
Landon, and I expect

28:12.820 --> 28:15.940
very little from it.

28:15.940 --> 28:18.910
But Elizabeth wants me,

28:18.910 --> 28:20.820
and I want her, too.

28:20.820 --> 28:25.200
I guess none of that matters
now since I failed your test.

28:53.310 --> 28:56.190
It's actually kind of beautiful.
I guess.

28:56.190 --> 28:59.240
If you can look past
the visions of doom.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.160
Thank you for doing this.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.620
I couldn't have done
this without you.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.580
No, thank you.

29:04.580 --> 29:08.000
This is the most normal
I've felt all day.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.120
You should know
Vincent also told me that

29:12.120 --> 29:14.090
the Sandclock degrades
over time.

29:14.090 --> 29:16.960
At some point, it will
break down from the inside

29:16.960 --> 29:18.050
no matter what we do.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.970
But this will at least
give us some time

29:19.970 --> 29:21.510
to figure out how to defuse it.

I don't want to be
either of those things.

doing black magic, my head...

33:48.610 --> 33:50.530
What if he wasn't
screwing you over?

33:50.530 --> 33:55.700
What if he made you human
to give you a shot at peace?

33:55.700 --> 34:01.290
And if you could have
just lived that life well,

34:01.290 --> 34:03.330
you might have gotten there.

34:03.330 --> 34:05.830
He gave you a chance
to start over.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.710
And you blew it, Ted.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.640

34:43.710 --> 34:46.040
How did you find me?
You think I'm
gonna let you

34:46.040 --> 34:49.380
walk around my school
without an active locator spell?

34:49.380 --> 34:51.550
I know who you are now.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.800
And I can't let you
loose in the world.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.890
But I know even vampires
can change.

34:55.890 --> 34:59.260
So I'm gonna give you a chance
to prove me wrong about you.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.600
But you're gonna have
to follow my rules.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.810
I don't follow orders anymore.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.900
Then you're gonna have
to go back in the box.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.690
I'll just get out again.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.860
And it will be your daughter
who sets me free.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.530
Yeah, you see,
I can control her mind.

35:14.530 --> 35:19.700
Oh, how I love that control.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.620

35:29.040 --> 35:31.210
Mm-hmm, yes.

35:31.210 --> 35:34.630
No matter what you do
or where you go,

35:34.630 --> 35:39.300
you will not be able
to protect her from me.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.890
(chuckles):
Kym.

37:42.890 --> 37:44.640
JOSIE:
I should have asked
for help sooner.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.060
I was so worried that the
Sandclock would break,

37:46.060 --> 37:48.480
and all that magic
would come back to me

37:48.480 --> 37:50.230
and I'd end up hurting someone.

37:50.230 --> 37:52.560
But it didn't.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.440
We're all safe.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.530
I know, and, um,

37:58.530 --> 38:02.860
I didn't ask because I thought
that I'd be okay

38:02.860 --> 38:04.700
seeing you and Hope together,

38:04.700 --> 38:09.700
but it actually kind of just
feels, like, really lonely.

38:09.700 --> 38:13.540
And it's...
kind of just what I do.

38:13.540 --> 38:16.170
I push people away
when I need them most.

38:16.170 --> 38:19.550
Because I'm ridiculous.

38:19.550 --> 38:23.130
Would it make you feel better to
hear how I was ridiculous today?

38:23.130 --> 38:24.550
Yeah.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.600
Um...

38:27.600 --> 38:31.100
When Sebastian flipped out
on the witches,

38:31.100 --> 38:33.730
I realized there was nothing
I could do to help.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.610
I'm not one
of the heroes here,

38:35.610 --> 38:37.650
and I thought
I was okay with it.

38:37.650 --> 38:41.490
But now I don't know.

38:41.490 --> 38:44.240
It's not too late to become one.

38:45.570 --> 38:47.740
And you are not ridiculous.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.080
I missed talking to you
like this.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.750
(laughs)

38:53.750 --> 38:55.540
I want us to be friends.

38:55.540 --> 38:56.790
Not like ex friends,

38:56.790 --> 38:58.090
like actual friends.

38:58.090 --> 38:59.460
(laughs):
That sounds nice.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.590

JOSIE:
It's not exactly how it was,
but we thought maybe

39:23.860 --> 39:27.280
you might like it if we changed
it up a little bit.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.850
You kicked Sebastian out, right?

39:54.850 --> 39:57.560
Uh...

39:57.560 --> 40:00.480
I gave him the option
to follow the rules.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.320
But he,

40:02.320 --> 40:04.900
he chose to leave instead.

40:04.900 --> 40:08.490
So he didn't want to stay.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.410
No.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.240
Good.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.830
That's-that's good.

40:15.830 --> 40:20.920
Uh, honestly, I, I'm just
relieved that he's gone.

40:26.470 --> 40:28.470
(crying):
No, i-it's good.

40:28.470 --> 40:30.720
It's a good thing.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.560
(quietly):
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.560
Aw...

40:34.560 --> 40:36.560
(crying)

40:40.230 --> 40:41.440

40:46.780 --> 40:48.240
(Necromancer chuckles)

40:49.240 --> 40:51.570
I don't see anything.

40:51.570 --> 40:53.200
I do.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.410

40:58.410 --> 41:00.420

41:00.420 --> 41:02.540

41:02.540 --> 41:03.920
(gasps)

41:03.920 --> 41:05.920
(low growl)
(chuckles)

41:08.090 --> 41:09.300
Hello there,

41:09.300 --> 41:10.430
my new friend.

41:13.810 --> 41:17.600
Malivore promised you
peace, didn't he?

41:20.310 --> 41:22.810
I have a much better offer.

41:22.810 --> 41:24.820
I can grant you

41:24.820 --> 41:27.990
freedom from death.

41:27.990 --> 41:30.280
All you have to do

41:30.280 --> 41:34.660
is pay a visit
to the Salvatore School

41:34.660 --> 41:39.620
and bring me back what I need.
