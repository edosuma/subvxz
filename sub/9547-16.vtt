<i>Previously on Monk...</i>

00:01.659 --> 00:04.405
The crime scene boys found something
here that might upset you.

00:04.514 --> 00:06.154
Look at the fingerprints.
Thumb,

00:06.230 --> 00:09.669
index finger, middle finger.
Ring finger, pinky.

00:09.814 --> 00:10.721
Six fingers?

00:10.759 --> 00:13.426
20 years, I've only seen
one other bomb like that.

00:13.484 --> 00:15.424
Trudy?
<i>Trudy!</i>

00:17.807 --> 00:19.753
I said, stay back!
I mean it!

00:19.869 --> 00:21.559
Wait a minute,
i know you.

00:21.633 --> 00:23.817
- You're the cop with the wife.
- Who hired you?

00:23.886 --> 00:25.605
I tell you that, i'm a dead man.

00:28.988 --> 00:32.747
Sheriff's department.
Drop that weapon. I'm not asking twice.

00:32.921 --> 00:35.370
You have the right to remain silent.

00:35.486 --> 00:37.155
You have the right to an attorney.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.725
- What the hell happened?
- Monk jimmied the lock on the van.

00:39.802 --> 00:42.574
He jumped out.
Your boss is a murder suspect.

00:42.594 --> 00:45.657
Right now, he's acting like
a very guilty murder suspect.

00:45.743 --> 00:47.695
If you get a clean shot, bring him down.

00:47.805 --> 00:50.453
Leland, I know who set me up.
It was that sheriff.

00:50.511 --> 00:53.852
- Rollins? Why?
- <i>I don't know why, but I know how.</i>

00:56.064 --> 00:57.264
That was Adrian Monk.

00:57.353 --> 00:59.556
- Call the tac squad.
- He said I should come alone.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.080
- Are you setting me up, Leland?
- Monk, just put the gun away.

01:02.141 --> 01:02.818
Monk!

01:03.866 --> 01:04.599
Monk!

01:05.160 --> 01:06.822
Monk, please, drop the gun!

01:41.100 --> 01:41.997
Morning.

01:42.628 --> 01:43.923
Great morning, Monk.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.768
How do you feel?

01:50.416 --> 01:51.468
I don't know.

01:52.789 --> 01:54.346
How about happy to be alive?

01:55.236 --> 01:56.782
No, that's not it.

01:57.661 --> 01:59.799
- Nice shooting.
- Thank you.

02:00.319 --> 02:02.541
I brought you some water
and some dry clothes.

02:03.772 --> 02:06.052
Where,
where's everybody else?

02:06.223 --> 02:07.595
They're looking for your body.

02:07.902 --> 02:09.949
Found your jacket about two miles south.

02:10.059 --> 02:11.837
That should keep them busy for a while.

02:13.305 --> 02:15.455
Hey, not too shabby
for somebody who can't swim.

02:15.494 --> 02:17.774
I was
highly motivated.

02:19.351 --> 02:20.646
What should I do now?

02:21.156 --> 02:21.948
You...

02:22.617 --> 02:24.241
Don't do anything.

02:24.741 --> 02:26.604
You're a dead man. You disappear.

02:26.806 --> 02:29.859
I'm gonna poke around a bit and see
if I can't figure out what's going on.

02:29.898 --> 02:31.093
Whatever it is,

02:31.229 --> 02:33.180
it's big.
Scary big.

02:34.838 --> 02:37.115
- You think I can.
- No, you cannot call Natalie.

02:37.154 --> 02:38.973
You cannot call Dr. Kroger.

02:39.011 --> 02:41.098
How could you call them
if you don't exist?

02:41.983 --> 02:44.629
Monk, they want to lock you away,
and they have the evidence to do it.

02:44.662 --> 02:46.980
And after this little stunt,
they could put me away too.

02:48.696 --> 02:49.894
You better get going.

02:51.614 --> 02:55.451
There is a bus stop
behind the gas station up on silvertree.

03:03.034 --> 03:04.097
Hey, thanks.

03:05.589 --> 03:06.845
Thanks for killing me.

03:08.186 --> 03:09.761
Hey, that's what friends are for.

Natalie.

04:29.220 --> 04:29.858
Hey.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.501
How are you doing?

04:32.590 --> 04:34.029
I don't know. About the same.

04:35.020 --> 04:35.928
These were

04:36.685 --> 04:37.803
out front.

04:38.755 --> 04:39.702
From Sharona.

04:41.076 --> 04:42.139
They're beautiful.

04:44.728 --> 04:46.216
Why don't you put them over there.

04:50.201 --> 04:52.868
She and Benjy are gonna
fly in for the service.

04:53.632 --> 04:54.632
It's funny.

04:54.896 --> 04:57.427
When he was alive, he always said
he didn't have any friends.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.779
Hey, would it be okay
if I wrote a song for the service?

05:05.054 --> 05:07.430
Yeah, Randy, that would be wonderful.

05:08.163 --> 05:09.400
He would've liked that.

05:09.473 --> 05:11.522
Mr. Monk was a big, big, big.

05:13.535 --> 05:15.642
He knew how much you really love music.

05:17.690 --> 05:18.560
Great.

05:19.881 --> 05:20.665
Look,

05:21.314 --> 05:22.763
I found one of him smiling.

05:23.552 --> 05:25.233
Didn't see that very often.

05:28.590 --> 05:30.630
Listen, Natalie,
the Captain's out front.

05:30.727 --> 05:32.137
He'd really like to come in.

05:34.050 --> 05:34.649
No.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.845
Natalie, he
didn't have a choice.

05:41.113 --> 05:43.083
- Monk fired the first shot.
- Don't tell me that.

05:43.103 --> 05:44.301
There's always a choice.

05:44.337 --> 05:46.617
- He could have fired a warning shot.
- That's not trained.

05:46.656 --> 05:49.438
You know what? How about shot him
in the leg or not fired at all?

05:51.887 --> 05:52.660
God,

05:53.765 --> 05:54.809
I can't believe it.

05:55.844 --> 05:57.873
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe he's gone.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.723
I'm so sorry.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.638
Hey, the door was open.

06:09.696 --> 06:11.106
Is there anything i can do?

06:16.541 --> 06:18.621
I understand.
I'll catch you later.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.948
Wait, no, Captain.

06:22.285 --> 06:23.154
I'm sorry.

06:23.913 --> 06:25.884
This must be harder on you than anybody.

06:26.392 --> 06:27.803
Please, come, come in.

06:29.101 --> 06:29.958
Thanks.

06:31.136 --> 06:32.605
Pretty flowers.

06:34.834 --> 06:37.636
- So have they found his.
- No,

06:38.529 --> 06:39.495
not yet.

06:39.631 --> 06:41.740
The coast guard says
they might never find him.

06:41.824 --> 06:43.254
It just depends on the currents.

06:43.447 --> 06:44.133
Yep.

06:44.197 --> 06:46.298
It's just that i'm planning the service,

06:46.713 --> 06:48.287
and it's just hard without closure.

06:48.365 --> 06:49.877
I appreciate that.

06:50.738 --> 06:51.472
I...

06:53.375 --> 06:55.945
Randy told me that you rented out
the legion of honor.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.009
Yeah.

06:57.624 --> 07:00.608
And he also said that you took out
a loan to cover the costs?

07:00.822 --> 07:02.696
- Yeah, that's right.
- It's just...

07:03.489 --> 07:05.595
I don't think you need
to be so extravagant.

07:07.863 --> 07:09.544
- You don't?
- No.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.930
In fact, i remember once, Monk told me,

07:11.976 --> 07:14.690
he said that if anything ever happened
to him, he...

07:16.149 --> 07:18.009
Wouldn't want anybody to go into debt.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.004
I cannot believe you're saying that.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.452
He was your friend.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.617
- Nat, i'm just trying to honor what he.
- No, no, no, no, no. He loved you.

07:25.637 --> 07:27.918
I mean, he really loved you,
and you sit here

07:28.401 --> 07:30.488
I changed my mind.
I want you out of here.

07:30.623 --> 07:32.208
I'm going to ask you to leave,

07:33.560 --> 07:34.449
please.

07:35.248 --> 07:36.060
Look,

07:37.103 --> 07:39.109
- Natalie, you don't understand.
- Yeah, I don't.

07:39.129 --> 07:40.710
I'm sorry, Captain. Good-bye.

08:01.677 --> 08:05.039
<i>WELCOME TO SPARKS NEVADA</i>

08:22.934 --> 08:24.074
Cual es el problema?

08:24.112 --> 08:27.417
-<i> Apurate!</i>
-  <i>Apurate! Ombré.</i>

08:28.991 --> 08:31.630
- What's the problem?
- Es el nuevo. Es terrible!

08:31.734 --> 08:33.856
Rodriguez, how many times
have I told you?

08:33.876 --> 08:35.789
It doesn't have to be perfect, hombre.

08:36.001 --> 08:38.842
You don't have to clean
the inside of a cigarette lighter.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.129
Nobody cares about the inside
of a damn cigarette lighter!

08:43.477 --> 08:44.559
Put it down!

08:45.616 --> 08:46.474
Rodriguez,

08:46.571 --> 08:48.656
the faster we work,
the more money we make.

08:49.126 --> 08:51.870
Fast, more money.
Slow, less money.

08:52.212 --> 08:53.449
Comprende?
Good.

08:59.226 --> 09:00.753
55, you're all set!

09:03.089 --> 09:04.352
Look, Rodriguez,

09:04.680 --> 09:05.946
it's not that complicated.

09:06.018 --> 09:07.525
Even you can understand.

09:07.662 --> 09:08.687
We get paid

09:09.138 --> 09:10.008
per car,

09:10.234 --> 09:11.793
- get it?
- Per car.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.737
Mr. Larry!
Larry, relax.

09:15.939 --> 09:17.479
You're going to have another stroke.

09:17.638 --> 09:20.440
This guy's the best rag man i ever seen.

09:20.498 --> 09:23.009
Look at that car. It's better
than new. It's like a diamond.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.739
When the owner sees it,
he gonna love it.

09:24.759 --> 09:27.276
He gonna tell all his friends.
He's gonna be a customer for life.

09:27.332 --> 09:29.554
Well, it's about friggin' time.

09:29.713 --> 09:31.549
I've been waiting over there 20 minutes.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.255
You won't be seeing me again.

09:40.145 --> 09:41.208
Have a nice day.

09:43.024 --> 09:43.903
Rodriguez,

09:44.550 --> 09:45.768
i'm warning you.

09:47.535 --> 09:48.559
I'm warning you!

10:04.429 --> 10:06.013
Hello. One minute.

10:06.128 --> 10:07.253
Mr. Rodriguez?

10:07.314 --> 10:08.628
Just, just a minute.

10:12.241 --> 10:12.927
Hello.

10:12.947 --> 10:15.523
I'm sorry to bother you.
You were asking about room number ten.

10:15.562 --> 10:17.534
- You wanted to switch?
- Yeah.

10:20.427 --> 10:23.666
My father said ten will be available
on sunday, but

10:23.773 --> 10:26.037
you understand it's basically

10:26.080 --> 10:28.739
the same room, just
a different number.

10:32.912 --> 10:34.670
Right, I, I, I understand.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.949
Be a good girl.
I'm sorry, she's just a Puppy.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.369
We're still teaching her.

10:40.401 --> 10:43.121
She's not on a leash? Where's her leash?
She should have a leash.

10:43.141 --> 10:45.760
No. She has a special collar,
actually, a shock collar.

10:46.514 --> 10:48.698
My father put a wire around the motel.

10:48.947 --> 10:50.319
It's like an invisible fence.

10:50.490 --> 10:52.654
If she wanders too far,
she gets a little zap.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.861
Yeah, I know how she feels.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.162
Here.

10:58.226 --> 10:59.266
What's all this?

10:59.316 --> 11:01.613
It's just research.
I'm writing a story.

11:02.004 --> 11:04.282
You write about criminals?
Like, mysteries?

11:04.517 --> 11:06.631
- Well...
- You know what you should write about?

11:06.697 --> 11:08.115
You should write about this.

11:09.867 --> 11:12.319
It actually just happened
two miles from here.

11:12.377 --> 11:14.245
A highway worker was killed.

11:14.265 --> 11:16.643
- Really? Yeah?
- Yeah, it's a real-life mystery

11:16.693 --> 11:18.448
with real clues and everything.

11:19.562 --> 11:22.394
Yeah, it was hit-and-run, actually.
They're looking for a silver suv.

11:22.471 --> 11:24.281
- Yeah.
- I can leave it if you want.

11:24.339 --> 11:27.921
No, no, that, that's okay.
You, you can take it. Take, take...

11:29.104 --> 11:31.699
Well,
i'll let you get back to your work.

11:32.154 --> 11:34.197
- Good night, mr. Rodriguez.
- Good night.

11:34.673 --> 11:36.296
Eureka, what are you doing?

11:36.480 --> 11:38.393
Come on, Eureka,
let's go.

11:42.462 --> 11:43.738
Eureka.

11:46.430 --> 11:48.575
He's over here.
I think it might be your boy.

11:48.652 --> 11:50.768
Male caucasian, late 40s, 5'11".

11:51.069 --> 11:54.084
I read the posting.
Said gunshot wound.

11:54.142 --> 11:55.944
Yes, sir, it looks
like two to the chest.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.243
The coast guard just
fished him out of avalon bay.

12:00.828 --> 12:01.853
Is that a tattoo?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.193
Yes, sir.

12:21.619 --> 12:22.747
It's not him.

12:22.824 --> 12:24.578
<i>Of course it isn't him.</i>

12:24.673 --> 12:27.378
<i>I've been telling you, Monk is alive.</i>

12:27.512 --> 12:28.807
You can't be sure.

12:28.967 --> 12:31.827
<i>That's true, I can't. You can.</i>

12:32.427 --> 12:34.552
<i>He's out there. He's somewhere.</i>

12:35.182 --> 12:36.149
Find him!

12:43.018 --> 12:44.728
Does everybody have them?
You have yours?

12:44.758 --> 12:45.618
Good.

12:50.651 --> 12:51.578
Hey, captain.

12:52.335 --> 12:53.231
Are you okay?

12:53.518 --> 12:56.020
Yeah, i'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine?

12:56.297 --> 12:58.771
No reason.
Rollins is still in the office.

12:59.116 --> 13:00.662
The guys are wearing these for Monk.

13:00.725 --> 13:02.492
We weren't sure
if you wanted to wear it.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.127
Of course I do, randy.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.640
Thank you.

13:09.152 --> 13:10.552
- Two?
- For the other arm.

13:11.863 --> 13:13.680
- Right. To make it even.
- Make 'em even.

13:13.741 --> 13:14.504
Monk.

13:18.876 --> 13:20.824
Hello, Sheriff Rollins.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.824
Make yourself at home.

13:23.201 --> 13:24.612
You read the paper today?

13:25.078 --> 13:25.818
I did.

13:25.902 --> 13:28.511
I read the sports page.
I did the jumble.

13:29.205 --> 13:30.466
Not the jumble.

13:30.563 --> 13:32.489
This,
page five.

13:34.975 --> 13:36.992
Male,
caucasian,

13:37.458 --> 13:38.560
5'11".

13:38.895 --> 13:39.939
Late 40s.

13:40.765 --> 13:42.209
- Is it Monk?
- No.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.437
It's not Monk.

13:44.215 --> 13:46.360
I was at the morgue last night.

13:46.857 --> 13:49.079
The guy had a tattoo and red hair.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.517
I thought it was strange.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.070
- What was strange?
- Well,

13:55.660 --> 13:57.650
i'll tell you what was strange.

14:02.057 --> 14:03.707
You weren't there.

14:05.103 --> 14:08.697
A bulletin was sent in. It was in
the daily log. You must have read it.

14:09.434 --> 14:12.338
You guys won't mind
if I hang around a few more days,

14:12.490 --> 14:14.808
see if anything else washes up?

14:16.015 --> 14:18.582
Knock yourself out.
We can use all the help we can get.

14:18.639 --> 14:20.803
- We all got to suffer.
- Yeah.

14:22.711 --> 14:25.308
- I'll see you boys around the Campus.
- Bye-bye.

14:36.366 --> 14:37.119
What?

14:38.081 --> 14:39.651
It's a good question.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.915
- Why didn't you check it out?
- Because I was busy.

14:43.108 --> 14:44.944
I was turning over rocks,

14:45.822 --> 14:48.160
trying to get a bead
on that son of a bitch.

14:54.058 --> 14:55.866
He just bought
a second house in Catalina.

14:55.905 --> 14:58.465
And a new BMW, and look at this.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.190
He's got two offshore bank accounts

15:02.812 --> 15:04.609
on a Sheriff's salary.

15:05.403 --> 15:07.993
Randy, this guy is dirty.
I can smell him.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.873
What is it?
This one's been repainted.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.669
Recently.

15:35.487 --> 15:36.879
It useto be silver.

15:38.663 --> 15:40.151
They're looking for a silver suv.

15:55.193 --> 15:56.193
Are you okay?

16:05.980 --> 16:07.139
What are you doing?

16:09.759 --> 16:11.904
Well, at least make it look
like you're working.

16:12.161 --> 16:13.896
I need you to look under the car.

16:14.244 --> 16:14.987
What?

16:15.045 --> 16:17.158
Just, behind this fender.

16:17.912 --> 16:19.555
Inside, tell me what you see.

16:20.191 --> 16:22.639
Check the axle.
You're gonna get us both fired.

16:22.736 --> 16:24.553
Right, right behind this front wheel.

16:27.379 --> 16:28.642
What are these?

16:37.003 --> 16:38.367
A highway worker was killed.

16:47.542 --> 16:51.922
And so these are gonna go to his
brother Ambrose's house, and

16:52.724 --> 16:54.579
those will go to my garage.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.821
All these books.
What was he, a professor?

16:57.843 --> 16:58.925
No, a Detective.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.905
An amazing Detective.

17:02.376 --> 17:04.387
He could look at a room or a person

17:04.425 --> 17:06.349
and see things that
nobody else could see.

17:06.521 --> 17:08.009
Like the car wash guy.

17:08.448 --> 17:09.267
Yeah.

17:10.156 --> 17:11.760
What car wash guy?

17:11.819 --> 17:13.798
The guy in Nevada.
I was just reading about him.

17:16.147 --> 17:18.002
Here.
It's in today's paper.

17:18.546 --> 17:20.150
They call him the "car wash Columbo."

17:20.632 --> 17:22.738
He solved a big hit-and-run case
single-handedly.

17:23.287 --> 17:24.968
Yeah. Sounds like a real character.

17:25.413 --> 17:27.925
His boss says it takes him a whole hour
to wipe down every car.

17:27.983 --> 17:29.510
Won't even use the same rag twice.

17:31.027 --> 17:32.031
Can I see that?

17:33.573 --> 17:34.384
Yeah.

17:36.663 --> 17:37.803
There's no picture.

17:37.947 --> 17:39.222
I guess he's modest too.

17:41.001 --> 17:42.721
Leland Rodriguez.

17:43.582 --> 17:45.328
His name is Leland?

17:48.756 --> 17:50.476
Captain Stottlemeyer. Where is he?

17:50.691 --> 17:52.140
- I don't know.
- Where is he?

17:54.025 --> 17:54.994
It's not mine.

17:55.083 --> 17:58.305
It matches the set in your mother's
kitchen. How do you explain that?

17:58.325 --> 17:59.581
My mom's not the only one.

17:59.627 --> 18:01.476
- I have to talk to you.
- what are you doing?

18:01.520 --> 18:04.504
Is this him? It's him, isn't it?
He's the "car wash Columbo."

18:05.361 --> 18:07.865
<i>CAR WASH COLUMBO</i>

18:09.103 --> 18:13.078
- Reginald, we need to take a break.
- Cool, i'll wait outside.

18:13.136 --> 18:14.144
Nice try, kid.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.954
Jackson, could you baby-sit
my young friend here for a minute?

18:26.508 --> 18:28.015
It's him, isn't it?

18:31.884 --> 18:32.947
Oh, my god.

18:34.526 --> 18:35.859
Oh, my god.

18:36.888 --> 18:37.970
Oh, my god.

18:38.897 --> 18:41.814
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Natalie, Natalie, Natalie, Natalie.

18:43.829 --> 18:45.259
I am so sorry.

18:45.414 --> 18:46.689
You're sorry?!

18:48.180 --> 18:49.069
But how?

18:49.230 --> 18:51.900
Bulletproof vest.
We couldn't tell anybody.

18:54.203 --> 18:55.517
"Leland rodriguez"?

18:55.611 --> 18:57.663
- That's his name.
- Well, that's just stupid.

18:57.683 --> 18:58.947
What's he doing in Nevada?

18:58.986 --> 19:01.698
He's supposed to be avoiding attention,
staying off the radar.

19:01.718 --> 19:02.800
He's all alone?

19:02.836 --> 19:04.641
Natalie, you can't tell anybody.
You can't

19:04.661 --> 19:06.328
tell randy.
You can't even tell Julie.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.546
Randy doesn't know?

19:07.844 --> 19:09.567
No. I'm trying to protect him.

19:09.685 --> 19:11.521
- From what?
- I'm not sure.

19:12.036 --> 19:15.150
There's something going on here.
That Sheriff Rollins, he framed Monk

19:15.208 --> 19:17.482
for shooting the six-fingered man.
You were there.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.729
They were gonna send Monk away forever.

19:19.883 --> 19:21.211
And it's not just Rollins.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.701
Rollins is working for somebody,
maybe somebody in the governor's office.

19:24.721 --> 19:25.480
My god.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.483
It might go higher
than that, i'm not sure.

19:27.522 --> 19:30.036
I'm still working on it.
I just need a little more time.

19:30.925 --> 19:33.149
- I have to see him.
- Natalie, no.

19:33.615 --> 19:34.871
Leave him alone.

19:34.985 --> 19:36.438
He's safe where he is.

19:36.679 --> 19:39.558
You have to promise me you're not
gonna do anything. Promise me.

19:40.030 --> 19:40.785
Okay.

19:41.738 --> 19:43.574
Okay, I promise.

20:06.103 --> 20:08.644
- Make me happy.
- She's on the move.

20:08.785 --> 20:10.717
It looks like a real road trip.

20:11.121 --> 20:13.948
Took her daughter to a neighbor's,
packed a suitcase.

20:13.987 --> 20:14.963
<i>Stay with her.</i>

20:14.983 --> 20:17.177
<i>She'll lead you right to him.</i>

20:17.243 --> 20:19.233
What do I do when I find him?

20:19.335 --> 20:20.838
<i>Do you really have to ask?</i>

20:20.904 --> 20:22.972
No, sir, I do not.

20:27.813 --> 20:31.098
Tru, Trudy
Trudy

20:32.027 --> 20:34.845
okay, okay, i'm gonna,
just give you a little heads up

20:35.025 --> 20:36.262
before the service.

20:37.356 --> 20:40.718
It's, uh, it's kind of a
protest song.

20:41.374 --> 20:45.679
It's gonna be pretty controversial,
especially the tenth verse, where I

20:46.125 --> 20:48.127
talk about the actual shooting.

20:48.231 --> 20:50.917
I mean, I don't mention you by name.
I just, I call you "the man."

20:50.946 --> 20:53.807
The tenth verse? Randy,
how many verses are there in total?

20:56.846 --> 20:57.619
Good.

21:37.801 --> 21:40.722
<i>Why</i>

21:40.818 --> 21:43.775
<i>tell me why</i>

21:44.872 --> 21:48.326
<i>did a good man</i>

21:48.446 --> 21:51.596
<i>have to die?</i>

21:52.816 --> 21:55.576
<i>Shot down</i>

21:55.672 --> 21:59.431
<i>in his prime</i>

21:59.561 --> 22:01.532
<i>48</i>

22:03.390 --> 22:05.245
<i>or 49</i>

22:07.769 --> 22:10.689
<i>why</i>

22:10.805 --> 22:14.709
<i>tell me why</i>

22:14.753 --> 22:17.697
- <i>did a good man</i>
- Randy.

22:18.290 --> 22:21.492
- <i>have to die?</i>
- Randy, he's not dead.

22:21.616 --> 22:22.602
<i>Has...</i>

22:30.305 --> 22:31.330
We faked it.

22:34.002 --> 22:35.760
Monk jumped off the pier.

22:43.349 --> 22:45.301
He was wearing a bulletproof vest.

22:47.195 --> 22:48.142
He's alive.

22:51.669 --> 22:52.616
He's alive.

22:54.048 --> 22:55.420
Yep. He's in hiding

22:56.011 --> 22:58.117
until we figure out
what the hell's going on.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.682
I can't believe it.

23:05.441 --> 23:06.407
You okay?

23:06.703 --> 23:07.379
Did,

23:07.688 --> 23:08.809
Yeah...

23:09.882 --> 23:12.240
I'm thrilled, yeah.
Yeah, I just.

23:14.701 --> 23:16.053
You look disappointed.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.156
It's just, it's the best song
i ever wrote.

23:21.682 --> 23:23.830
Well,
well, save it.

23:24.418 --> 23:26.868
It's a great song.
He's gonna die one day.

23:27.898 --> 23:30.758
Yeah.
But you're not gonna shoot him.

23:31.252 --> 23:32.547
You never know.

23:37.347 --> 23:39.574
Hey, Sherlock Holmes,
you know how to lock up, right?

23:39.612 --> 23:41.595
Make sure you put the rags
in the washing machine.

23:41.615 --> 23:43.716
Don't clean the washing machine.
Just put the rags

23:43.750 --> 23:45.586
in the washing machine,
understand?

23:46.289 --> 23:47.603
See youmaÑana.

24:06.388 --> 24:08.057
Hola, seÑorita.

24:08.431 --> 24:09.262
Hola.

24:10.188 --> 24:11.715
Mr. Monk, i know it's you.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.321
What's with the wipe?
Why would I need a.

24:21.651 --> 24:24.318
God. God, why didn't you tell me?

24:24.714 --> 24:26.318
To protect you.

24:27.289 --> 24:29.016
I thought Rollins might be watching you.

24:29.055 --> 24:31.559
That's ridiculous.
Why would Rollins.

24:31.644 --> 24:35.029
Adrian, don't move a muscle.
Show me your hands.

24:35.128 --> 24:36.944
You too, miss Teeger.

24:37.757 --> 24:39.579
You are knee-deep in it now, buddy.

24:39.630 --> 24:42.683
You're the one that's in trouble.
We know all about how you set mr. Monk

24:42.728 --> 24:44.277
up and switched the gun barrels.

24:44.315 --> 24:46.398
If anybody's going to prison, it is you.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.113
Thanks for stopping by, Natalie.

24:48.152 --> 24:51.156
Let me tell you about the real world,
Natalie.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.848
It's never about
what happened.

24:53.868 --> 24:57.067
It's always,
can you prove what happened?

24:58.017 --> 25:00.607
All right, Adrian,
we've done this before.

25:01.047 --> 25:03.347
On the ground,
face down.

25:15.595 --> 25:18.625
- What was that?
- It was supposed to.

25:18.788 --> 25:20.469
It was supposed to go faster.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.191
Come on out, buddy.

25:36.928 --> 25:39.943
Don't make me do something
i'm not gonna regret.

25:46.883 --> 25:48.388
You too, Natalie.

25:48.562 --> 25:50.185
Aiding and abetting.

25:51.358 --> 25:53.213
I gotta call the big man.

25:53.298 --> 25:55.481
He's not paying me enough for this crap.

25:55.558 --> 25:58.175
The big man?
This way.

26:11.329 --> 26:12.199
Over there.

26:27.567 --> 26:28.688
What are you doing?

26:28.753 --> 26:30.946
We're taking his car
so he can't follow us!

26:31.343 --> 26:33.101
- Come on!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

26:44.288 --> 26:46.021
You got anything else?
Any pay stubs?

26:46.176 --> 26:49.538
No, no pay stub.
I have a birthday card and

26:50.296 --> 26:52.132
an unpaid electrical bill.

26:52.819 --> 26:53.554
Wait.

26:54.231 --> 26:56.113
Okay, there's a check for $10,000

26:56.152 --> 26:58.104
made out to angel county
children's center.

26:58.162 --> 27:00.249
Angel county children's center.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.433
No such animal.

27:06.498 --> 27:08.527
Okay, that check is dirty. Who wrote it?

27:08.578 --> 27:10.047
The Xanadu corporation.

27:10.124 --> 27:11.593
Xanadu corporation.

27:12.162 --> 27:13.225
No, "x."

27:19.514 --> 27:22.606
Xanadu, a division of the orpheum
investment group.

27:25.507 --> 27:28.386
Yeah, which is controlled
by the blue Danube Foundation,

27:28.540 --> 27:31.342
- Danube Foundation.
- Which is owned by...

27:33.519 --> 27:34.407
Oh, my god.

27:38.893 --> 27:40.246
Who's dale biederbeck?

27:44.915 --> 27:48.591
Not too hard.
The new skin is the most tender.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.702
That's it, right
there.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.021
I dreamt about you last night.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.760
Do you ever dream about me?

28:00.203 --> 28:01.227
Sometimes.

28:01.919 --> 28:04.818
I wonder if we're having the same dream.

28:05.757 --> 28:06.846
I doubt it.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.157
Biederbeck.

28:13.335 --> 28:14.436
You have a visitor.

28:15.126 --> 28:16.286
You have ten minutes.

28:16.363 --> 28:19.140
The eager miss Teeger!

28:19.217 --> 28:21.536
You took a big chance coming here.

28:22.502 --> 28:25.498
The photos i've seen
don't do you justice.

28:26.357 --> 28:28.204
Althena, we'll have to continue this

28:28.255 --> 28:30.890
tomorrow.
Remember where we left off.

28:36.249 --> 28:37.331
Do you mind?

28:37.468 --> 28:40.714
Watching Althena walk away
is the only exercise I get.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.423
You get a manicure every day?

28:51.745 --> 28:53.690
A computer, your own telephone.

28:53.892 --> 28:57.245
- It doesn't look like you're suffering.
- Believe me, Natalie, i suffer.

28:57.389 --> 29:00.264
Remember the day you got
the news about Mitch?

29:00.347 --> 29:02.280
- That's where I live.
- How do you know about.

29:02.318 --> 29:05.720
About your dead husband?
You work for Adrian Monk, Natalie.

29:05.816 --> 29:08.597
That makes you and your family
my business.

29:09.858 --> 29:11.056
Is that the Governor?

29:11.935 --> 29:12.978
I'm a big fan.

29:13.254 --> 29:15.355
Didn't he just refuse
to commute your sentence?

29:15.418 --> 29:16.654
Turn it off, please.

29:17.162 --> 29:19.699
- Turn what off?
- The video recorder in your purse.

29:19.757 --> 29:22.578
I won't be confessing
to anything today, Natalie.

29:24.007 --> 29:27.077
We don't have to play games.
I know Adrian Monk is alive.

29:27.097 --> 29:28.773
I never believed his oldest friend

29:28.831 --> 29:32.116
Leland Stottlemeyer
would actually shoot him.

29:32.522 --> 29:33.488
Did you?

29:35.862 --> 29:37.589
Really?

29:38.119 --> 29:40.168
To tell the truth, i'm so relieved.

29:40.442 --> 29:42.471
I don't want Monk dead.

29:43.091 --> 29:45.283
Ever since he put me here,

29:45.544 --> 29:48.578
my dream has been to trade
places with the man.

29:49.066 --> 29:49.812
I want

29:49.916 --> 29:50.670
Monk

29:50.882 --> 29:51.655
here!

29:52.173 --> 29:54.328
In this hellhole, Rotting away,

29:54.386 --> 29:56.694
slowly, slowly, slowly.

29:56.761 --> 29:58.156
What about Sheriff Rollins?

29:58.213 --> 30:00.292
- What about him?
- We know he's on your payroll.

30:00.756 --> 30:01.702
Is he really?

30:01.741 --> 30:04.448
He used to work here as a prison guard.
Is that where you met him?

30:04.583 --> 30:08.147
And we know you hired Frank Nunn.
You brought him back from south America.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.926
You're planning something.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.625
Whatever it is, mr. Biederbeck,

30:11.645 --> 30:13.585
you can forget about it
it's not going to happen.

30:13.623 --> 30:16.293
I'm afraid you're too late, Natalie.
Wheels are in motion.

30:16.506 --> 30:18.844
- It was nice meeting you.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.872
Before you go,
turn on your little machine.

30:22.049 --> 30:24.058
I want to say hello to your boss.

30:30.865 --> 30:32.063
Hello, Adrian.

30:32.305 --> 30:34.076
How's my favorite Desperado?

30:34.814 --> 30:37.863
So nice meeting Natalie.
We had a wonderful chat.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.396
She hardly seemed repulsed by me at all.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.274
In fact, I

30:42.352 --> 30:46.107
think i might offer her a job
you're in here

30:46.218 --> 30:48.382
- and i'm out there.
- He kept saying that.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.950
He kept talking about
trading places with you.

30:51.027 --> 30:52.743
He thinks he's getting out.

30:52.782 --> 30:54.662
If he's thinking of squeezing through
the bars,

30:54.682 --> 30:58.384
he's got 400 pounds to go.
What is that behind him?

30:59.252 --> 31:01.947
And you go as final,
that was there Dale.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.044
- It's a computer.
- It's a weather report.

31:04.108 --> 31:05.949
Riverton, California.

31:06.029 --> 31:07.005
Riverton.

31:07.426 --> 31:10.855
<i>Don't screw with me, man. I held up
my end. I just got back from Riverton.</i>

31:10.875 --> 31:12.479
<i>It's all set up. We're good to go.</i>

31:13.442 --> 31:14.543
Riverton.

31:22.767 --> 31:23.829
The Governor?

31:24.519 --> 31:25.968
They're gonna kill him.

32:09.387 --> 32:10.272
Where is he?

32:10.292 --> 32:12.189
- Do you see him?
- Where is he?

32:29.400 --> 32:31.371
Mr. Biederbeck, can you talk?

32:31.971 --> 32:34.212
You're missing a beautiful parade.

32:34.243 --> 32:37.161
- Lots of balloons.
- <i>I was hoping for some fireworks.</i>

32:38.151 --> 32:40.094
I think they're saving that for the end.

32:40.114 --> 32:41.365
- Here, here.
- Hey, hey.

32:41.396 --> 32:43.551
Excuse me, excuse me,
this man's a Detective.

32:43.584 --> 32:45.840
- Former. Former Detective.
- You have to stop the parade.

32:45.975 --> 32:47.921
We think there's a bomb
in the Governor's car.

32:47.959 --> 32:49.631
It's dale Biederbeck, dale the whale.

32:49.727 --> 32:51.098
Have you heard of him?

32:51.639 --> 32:54.436
- It's okay. I didn't either.
- He's a killer. He's in san quentin.

32:54.476 --> 32:56.836
He's been serving two consecutive.

32:56.966 --> 32:58.319
Consecutive life terms.

32:58.377 --> 33:01.426
The Governor refused to commute sentence
but the lieutenant governor will.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.635
He's got the Lieutenant
Governor in his pocket.

33:03.948 --> 33:05.760
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

33:05.799 --> 33:07.736
If he kills the Governor,
he gets out of jail.

33:07.794 --> 33:10.010
They hired a hitman named Frank Nunn.

33:10.067 --> 33:11.822
He has six fingers. It doesn't matter.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.998
Yeah, see, Nunn was here
in Riverton a week ago.

33:15.042 --> 33:17.598
We think he planted a bomb
in the Governor's car.

33:17.636 --> 33:19.993
Didn't need him anymore.
Nunn a loose end, so they killed him.

33:20.013 --> 33:21.672
It was a two-fer. They killed Nunn,

33:21.730 --> 33:24.547
and they tried to frame me for it.
Biederbeck hates me.

33:24.597 --> 33:26.529
He wants to trade places with me.

33:40.259 --> 33:41.699
By here.

33:55.129 --> 33:56.771
There he is! Go! Go!

33:58.436 --> 34:00.110
See that guy? He's wanted for murder.

34:00.168 --> 34:03.174
Get your men. Get after him.
Now! Let's go!

34:08.891 --> 34:11.007
How's he gonna do it? Remote control?

34:11.027 --> 34:13.621
No, no-no,
they would've set it off already.

34:14.277 --> 34:16.984
It must be on some kind of timer or...

34:26.714 --> 34:28.047
What's wrong, boy?

34:33.681 --> 34:35.150
Eureka.

34:35.216 --> 34:36.297
Excuse me?

34:36.966 --> 34:39.148
- Natalie, I just solved the case.
- Eureka?

34:39.206 --> 34:41.181
No, no, no.
I mean Eureka's a dog.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.976
<i>She was wearing one of those shock
collars</i>

34:45.208 --> 34:46.577
<i>with a little receiver.</i>

34:46.880 --> 34:50.764
<i>Look. There, there.
There's a battery.</i>

34:51.300 --> 34:54.947
<i>It's wired to a transmitter
that runs through that banner.</i>

34:59.275 --> 35:01.613
The bomb must be hooked
to one of those dog collars.

35:02.702 --> 35:05.909
Oh, my god. So when the car
goes by the banner...

35:07.062 --> 35:09.381
<i>Hey,
stop this parade!</i>

35:09.485 --> 35:13.170
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD. Stop
the parade. The Governor's in danger.

35:13.190 --> 35:13.925
Okay!

35:13.956 --> 35:15.513
Stop the parade.

35:21.593 --> 35:23.216
<i>Make it all stop!</i>

35:23.355 --> 35:26.611
<i>- Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hold up!</i>

35:26.914 --> 35:28.789
<i>Make it all stop.</i>

35:31.124 --> 35:32.863
Natalie, what are you doing?

35:33.506 --> 35:37.071
<i>I'm a police officer. I need for you
to stop the parade now. Now!</i>

35:37.457 --> 35:39.060
<i>Stop this parade!</i>

35:39.120 --> 35:41.285
Nat, Natalie, what are you doing?

35:41.607 --> 35:44.274
<i>What's wrong with you.
Stop the parade!</i>

35:44.456 --> 35:46.234
<i>- No, no.
- Drag her down.</i>

35:46.273 --> 35:47.953
<i>Get her down here.</i>

35:48.223 --> 35:51.995
John Rollins, you're under arrest
for murder and conspiracy to commit.

35:52.058 --> 35:55.107
We know you're working for Biederbeck.
We know you framed Monk.

35:55.146 --> 35:56.614
- Me?
- You're under arrest.

35:56.652 --> 35:59.499
Obstruction of justice,
aiding and abetting. Arrest him!

35:59.585 --> 36:02.805
No! I'm a Captain
of the San Francisco Police Department!

36:02.825 --> 36:03.868
Arrest him!

36:03.888 --> 36:06.523
He's out of his jurisdiction.
Arrest him!

36:06.658 --> 36:09.627
Captain, the trigger is in the banner!

36:12.570 --> 36:15.093
<i>Wait!
Trudy! No!</i>

36:15.654 --> 36:16.755
<i>No!</i>

36:27.187 --> 36:29.808
<i>Wait, stop!
Stop! There's a bomb!</i>

36:31.663 --> 36:33.596
<i>There's a bomb!</i>

36:54.192 --> 36:55.822
<i>There's a bomb!</i>

36:56.982 --> 36:58.760
<i>Don't move the vehicle!</i>

37:00.274 --> 37:02.825
<i>There's a bomb, i'm telling you.</i>

37:05.505 --> 37:06.672
<i>Hold on!</i>

37:07.586 --> 37:08.629
Look at this!

37:09.029 --> 37:11.968
Clear these people out of here!
Everybody clear!

37:12.476 --> 37:13.732
Call the bomb squad.

37:13.909 --> 37:15.540
We don't have one.

37:16.545 --> 37:18.419
It, it's in the budget for next year.

37:19.115 --> 37:20.835
I don't think we can wait that long.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.999
Could you take your hands
off my friend, please.

37:37.626 --> 37:38.857
He's had a long day.

37:42.063 --> 37:43.706
You have right to remain silent.

37:43.772 --> 37:47.076
Yeah, I know all that stuff.
Let's just get the hell out of here.

38:09.948 --> 38:11.057
Good job.

38:12.902 --> 38:14.062
Good job.

38:28.302 --> 38:29.422
Hello, Dale.

38:29.963 --> 38:32.611
Adrian Monk.

38:32.857 --> 38:35.208
Why am I not surprised?

38:35.305 --> 38:37.033
I tried to call, but

38:37.214 --> 38:39.006
apparently your phone's
been disconnected.

38:39.038 --> 38:42.073
Yes, I should've done it years ago.
Fewer distractions.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.698
I see they took your bed
and your computer.

38:44.749 --> 38:46.206
They were cluttering up the room.

38:46.226 --> 38:49.815
You know me, Monk. I've always been
a simple man of philosophic joys.

38:49.873 --> 38:52.335
And they're making you eat
in the cafeteria now.

38:52.734 --> 38:54.377
That can't be fun.

38:54.776 --> 38:56.476
At least you won't be eating alone.

38:56.891 --> 39:00.035
Your little friend Sheriff Rollins
will be joing you soon.

39:00.174 --> 39:02.281
He's talking to the D.A. Right now,

39:02.894 --> 39:04.401
telling him everything

39:04.848 --> 39:07.672
about how you hired
frank nunn to plant that bomb

39:07.711 --> 39:10.796
and then killed Nunn
and tried to frame me for it.

39:12.215 --> 39:14.808
Might want to save a seat
for the Lieutenant Governor too.

39:14.847 --> 39:16.151
Are you having fun?

39:16.545 --> 39:17.299
No.

39:19.530 --> 39:21.521
But it's as close as i'm ever gonna get.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.621
What did you win,
Monk?

39:25.391 --> 39:26.608
Nothing!

39:27.453 --> 39:29.444
We're both back where we started.

39:29.611 --> 39:30.597
Not exactly.

39:33.172 --> 39:36.436
The police in dourados found something
in Frank Nunn's apartment.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.437
Some old letters.

39:39.929 --> 39:41.938
He talked about killing Trudy.

39:44.369 --> 39:46.533
He mentioned the man
who hired him.

39:48.290 --> 39:52.347
You have a name!

39:52.766 --> 39:53.991
Yeah, not quite.

39:56.077 --> 39:57.430
Nunn called him

39:58.203 --> 39:59.246
"the Judge."

39:59.878 --> 40:01.192
The judge.

40:02.688 --> 40:04.567
- I can't help you, Adrian.
- Can't...

40:05.508 --> 40:06.513
Or won't?

40:09.179 --> 40:10.706
A little lead.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.580
How exciting.

40:13.549 --> 40:15.945
That should keep you
off the street for a while.

40:16.499 --> 40:18.995
The important thing
is that you're off the street.

40:19.247 --> 40:21.726
You really think
these bars

40:21.781 --> 40:22.860
can hold me?

40:27.586 --> 40:28.340
Yeah.

40:29.311 --> 40:30.934
They seem pretty strong.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.257
Have a good life, Dale.

40:35.204 --> 40:36.981
It's true, Adrian Monk!

40:37.268 --> 40:40.312
I'm in prison,
but you're in a worse prison!

40:40.436 --> 40:41.538
You're trapped!

40:41.616 --> 40:44.730
Trapped by your own demons!
You're in your own private hell!

40:45.012 --> 40:47.488
I wouldn't trade places with you

40:47.565 --> 40:49.518
for a billion dollars!

40:49.707 --> 40:52.567
I mean, another
billion dollars!

40:53.421 --> 40:54.464
You hear me?

40:54.502 --> 40:57.907
Come back here!
I'm... Not... Done!

40:57.972 --> 40:59.991
Yes, you are.
