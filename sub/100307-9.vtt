00:52.533 --> 00:54.967
Good morning!
You're in a good mood.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.867
- You bet.
And it's all up from here.

00:56.934 --> 00:59.000
(chuckling)

01:03.867 --> 01:07.166
- Sriracha tzatziki.
- Not familiar,

01:07.233 --> 01:09.300
but if I had to guess,
I'd prescribe an antifungal.

01:09.367 --> 01:11.967
- No. It's the specialty
at the fusion spot

01:12.033 --> 01:15.066
I'm taking you tonight.
- Ohhh... damn!

01:15.133 --> 01:17.066
I meant to text you.

01:17.133 --> 01:20.633
It's a PA day at
my daughter's school, and, um...

01:23.467 --> 01:26.200
The nanny is sick today, so...
- Rain cheque

01:26.266 --> 01:28.367
on the tzatziki.
- Yeah.

01:28.433 --> 01:31.734
- Man! My mom was a nurse;
I used to hate

01:31.800 --> 01:34.033
hanging around the hospital
waiting for her.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.200
Couldn't your ex take her?
Give the kid a break?

01:36.266 --> 01:38.066
- No.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.767
We don't get a lot

01:39.834 --> 01:41.767
of quality time together,
so I thought today could be fun.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.767
I'm gonna take her
down to Physio, check out

01:43.834 --> 01:46.000
the new pool.

01:46.066 --> 01:48.967
Right after I deliver
this baby.

01:49.033 --> 01:50.967
Hey, Ce!

01:51.033 --> 01:53.333
Wanna learn how to cut
the umbilical cord?

01:56.433 --> 01:58.233
Yeah?

01:58.300 --> 02:00.467
- Fun!

02:00.533 --> 02:02.667
(phone ringing)
(indistinct chatter)

02:02.734 --> 02:06.000
- Mr. Spellman was due for
an MRI 10 minutes ago, Janet.

02:06.066 --> 02:08.500
And, Tina, I'm waiting
on four urines and a stool.

02:08.567 --> 02:11.200
Don't roll
your eyes at me.

02:11.266 --> 02:13.033
- Gloria Danson.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.633
I need to see a doctor.
I've completely lost my hearing.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.633
- You can't hear
anything at all, Laurie?

02:17.700 --> 02:20.300
- It's Gloria.
And no, nothing.

02:20.367 --> 02:23.166
- Have a seat,
Glo. Bay 5.

02:27.367 --> 02:29.500
- Head injury? Alzheimer's?
- Worse.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.166
Frequent flyer.
Gloria comes in every week

02:32.233 --> 02:34.066
with a new complaint.
This month alone,

02:34.133 --> 02:36.000
she's had lockjaw,
typhus, leprosy.

02:36.066 --> 02:39.600
- Whoa, is that... is that
still a thing, leprosy?

02:39.667 --> 02:41.533
- You're lucky
you're handsome.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.000
- Oh.
- We get about 10 cases of
leprosy a year in this country,

02:45.066 --> 02:47.467
and Gloria ain't
one of them.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.333
She's a hypochondriac.
There's never anything wrong

02:52.400 --> 02:55.900
with her, and it's impossible
to get rid of her.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.200
And today, that's your problem.

02:58.266 --> 03:01.233
- Seriously? Why me?
- I'm slightly more confident

03:01.300 --> 03:03.700
you can't kill
someone who isn't actually sick.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.500
- Now, stick
with the walking cast, Floyd,

03:05.567 --> 03:08.834
you'll be back cruising retirees
at salsa class in no time.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.500
(Floyd laughing)
- Oh!

03:11.567 --> 03:13.367
- Whoa!

03:13.433 --> 03:17.233
But let's lay off
the dippin' for now, yeah?

03:17.300 --> 03:19.033
- Nice moves!

03:19.100 --> 03:21.667
- You got some yourself.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.834
I saw you rip it up
at the Sterling the other night.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.233
Next time, we skip drinks
and go dancing.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.066
I may not be Floyd, but...

03:27.133 --> 03:29.567
(both laughing)

03:29.633 --> 03:31.700
(fast typing)
- What is wrong with this thing?

03:31.767 --> 03:34.867
- Didn't you read the memo?
- No.

03:34.934 --> 03:37.767
Does anyone?
- Just the nerds. Right?

03:39.767 --> 03:41.600
It's part of the merger.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.567
Staff are being
randomly selected for intensive

03:43.633 --> 03:45.567
peer review. But you're
the first person I've actually

03:45.633 --> 03:48.033
heard of getting selected.
(typing on keyboard)

03:48.100 --> 03:50.033
- Yeah, I don't think
it's random.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.867
OK...

03:53.934 --> 03:56.000
"Endocrinology."

03:56.066 --> 03:58.400
Thanks.
- Hey.

03:58.467 --> 04:01.400
You know you don't have
anything to worry about, right?

04:01.467 --> 04:04.500
You're a good nurse, Grace.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.500
(sighing)

04:16.533 --> 04:20.033
(typing on keyboard)
(phone ringing)

04:20.100 --> 04:22.066
- This is Dr. Hamilton.
Obviously, he's pissed

04:22.133 --> 04:24.066
you tore up the NDA
and now he's gonna find

04:24.133 --> 04:26.500
a reason to fire you. Again.
- I know.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.333
- And if he can fire you twice
from two different hospitals,

04:28.400 --> 04:30.033
then when you do come clean
about what he did to you,

04:30.100 --> 04:32.166
it's just gonna look like
sour grapes from a bad employee.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.433
- I know!

04:37.333 --> 04:39.867
No offence, Ashley,
but your pep talks suck.

04:39.934 --> 04:42.400
- I know, I'm sorry. Look,

04:42.467 --> 04:45.166
we're here for you now, Grace,
OK? You are not alone.

04:45.233 --> 04:47.000
If Hamilton thinks
that you're just gonna

04:47.066 --> 04:48.834
turn and run,
or disappear quietly--

04:48.900 --> 04:50.500
- He's wrong.
- But you gotta make

04:50.567 --> 04:52.467
the first move and fast.
- I'm just not sure

04:52.533 --> 04:53.667
what that is yet.

04:53.734 --> 04:55.800
- Maybe you should
talk to a lawyer.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.834
- Ha! I can't.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.867
I dumped my lawyer.

05:02.734 --> 05:06.066
- "Paulus looked at her coolly.
He knew this beautiful woman had

05:06.133 --> 05:10.166
the information he needed, but
how would he get it from her?"

05:12.066 --> 05:15.734
- Oh, man! You guys finished
the Grisham from yesterday?

05:15.800 --> 05:18.266
How did it end?
- The ushe. Lawyer saves

05:18.333 --> 05:21.033
the day, gets the girl.
I give it 2 stars,

05:21.100 --> 05:23.600
but just as a sucker
for a happy ending.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.700
- And you're already that far
into the next one?

05:27.767 --> 05:30.700
Maddie, you didn't go home
last night, did you?

05:30.767 --> 05:33.400
- He's so close
to waking up. He, um...

05:33.467 --> 05:35.767
I mean, wiggling his toes,
reacting to stimulus.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.567
- It's not like the movies.
These are really good signs,

05:38.633 --> 05:41.500
but patients don't
wake up all at once,
it can take a while to surface.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.734
- Call me a romantic,
but I know Justin.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.633
He's close.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.233
I can feel it.

05:53.066 --> 05:55.767
- Dr. Wallace!
X-rays are back

05:55.834 --> 05:57.867
on the fender bender in Bay 2.
No breaks, but can you

05:57.934 --> 05:59.967
prescribe something
for burns from the airbag?

06:00.100 --> 06:02.033
- Yeah, she can have
some benzanthracene.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Here.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.433
- Uh! The 6-year-old with
anaphylactic shock
is stabilized,

06:08.500 --> 06:10.467
we'll refill his EpiPen script.
You good to discharge?

06:10.533 --> 06:12.867
- It's been five hours
already? Uh... fine,

06:12.934 --> 06:15.367
as soon as Sinead signs off.
- Hey, man! I need you in Bay 5.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.233
- I need two minutes
to go pee.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.166
I've been holding that
for three hours.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.900
- Why should you be any more
comfortable than the rest
of us? Get a catheter.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.266
- Bay 5...

06:27.834 --> 06:29.266
Yes!

06:31.800 --> 06:35.467
- Hi, Gloria.
What's the problem today?

06:35.533 --> 06:37.834
- I've gone deaf, Doc.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.400
- Sorry, what?
- I said I've lost my hearing!

06:42.033 --> 06:44.700
- I can't deal with this today.
- OK, OK. Come on, come on.

06:44.767 --> 06:47.400
OK, listen. She's, uh...
She's... Sorry.

06:47.467 --> 06:49.533
Um, there's nothing wrong
with her, right?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.533
Just check her ears,
send her home.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.900
- You're a big nurse now,
you can figure out a Gloria.

06:54.967 --> 06:57.667
(distant siren blaring)
(indistinct chatter)

07:01.533 --> 07:02.967
- Gloria...

07:03.033 --> 07:06.200
- Yeah. See,
that's why I'm confirming.

07:06.266 --> 07:09.567
I get choking on a chicken bone,
but the entire leg?

07:09.633 --> 07:12.333
Got it. I'll have the piece
to you in a couple of hours.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.667
- Is that an obituary?

07:15.734 --> 07:19.166
- Yeah. Not mine yet.
Small victories, right?

07:19.233 --> 07:20.533
- Haha!

07:20.600 --> 07:22.800
- Not a creep,
just a failed journalist.

07:22.867 --> 07:24.967
Quinn. I write obits

07:25.033 --> 07:27.200
for the city journal.
- Grace.

07:27.266 --> 07:30.400
Doesn't sound like a failure,
but it does sound maybe
a little bit--

07:30.467 --> 07:32.367
- Depressing?
- Yeah.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.200
- Especially when you're
being treated for advanced
papillary thyroid cancer.

07:35.266 --> 07:37.633
Still, better way to go
than death by drumstick.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.533
- Pupillary thyroid is
usually slow growing, but--

07:40.600 --> 07:42.700
- Mine isn't.

07:42.767 --> 07:45.233
- But you're young
and otherwise healthy,

07:45.300 --> 07:47.467
so your endocrinologist
wants to hit you with...

07:47.533 --> 07:49.934
an exceptionally high dose
of radiation.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.467
- Yeah, all good. Journalist
nerd did some research:

07:53.533 --> 07:56.533
sour foods are supposed to help
you excrete radioactivity.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.533
- Wow!

07:59.600 --> 08:01.600
- I just want to get
through this as fast

08:01.667 --> 08:03.734
as I can.
- Yeah.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.100
Showers help too. Helps clear
the radiation from your skin.

08:06.166 --> 08:10.600
- Not my typical bender,
but it's gonna be a weekend.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.800
- My hand's on fire!

08:14.867 --> 08:17.367
- OK, I'm Naz, I'm a nurse.
Can I take a look?

08:17.433 --> 08:18.767
- Yes.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.967
- OK. One... two...

08:21.033 --> 08:23.100
(crying)

08:23.166 --> 08:25.233
...three.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.266
- This will keep his muscles
from tightening,

08:30.333 --> 08:33.633
but he's losing mass.
- He's gonna be so mad.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.867
All those leg days
at the gym for nothing.

08:35.934 --> 08:37.533
(amused sigh)

08:37.600 --> 08:39.533
- I'm more worried
about exhaustion

08:39.600 --> 08:41.767
and malnutrition.

08:41.834 --> 08:44.734
Maddie, I got this.
(monitor beeping)

08:44.800 --> 08:47.000
(sighing)
- But what if he wakes up?

08:47.066 --> 08:49.700
- You'll miss it
if you're in a coma.

08:49.767 --> 08:52.767
Go home, eat something,
have a nap. Nurse's orders.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.033
Sriracha tzatziki.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.934
I don't know, J-Dawg,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.900
does that even sound good?

09:03.967 --> 09:06.367
What's your first meal
gonna be when you wake up?

09:06.433 --> 09:10.266
Me, probably go
for a burger

09:10.333 --> 09:14.200
or a nice, big, rare steak.

09:15.867 --> 09:19.567
Holy cow! Maddie!

09:19.633 --> 09:21.433
He's awake, Justin's back!

09:21.500 --> 09:25.066
- Oh, Justin! Oh, my God!

09:25.133 --> 09:27.667
- Slowly, buddy.
Little sips.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.834
You're at St. Mary's Hospital.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.233
You've been in a coma
for three weeks.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.166
- You were on a ski trip
before your bachelor weekend.

09:35.233 --> 09:37.633
You had a bad
snowboarding accident.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.367
- Are you... a doctor?

09:46.433 --> 09:49.200
- (laughing): No, Justin.

09:49.266 --> 09:51.166
It's me.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.033
It's Maddie, yeah.

10:06.266 --> 10:08.633
- So this is it, huh?

10:08.700 --> 10:10.333
Just take these little guys,

10:10.400 --> 10:12.800
cancer is toast.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.834
- Yeah, once you process
the radiation.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.600
I'll leave anything you need
in-between these two doors.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.000
This is the no-cross zone, OK?

10:20.066 --> 10:22.500
I can't come past
and enter the room.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.834
If you need anything,
use the phone.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.567
I'll be right over there
at the nurses station.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.600
Before I go, is there
anything else I can get you?

10:28.667 --> 10:30.734
- Uh, I don't think so.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.934
Got my laptop,
Mom's cooler

10:33.000 --> 10:35.233
of food...

10:35.300 --> 10:37.533
nothing to do,
but sit here and purge poison.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.934
- And keep hydrated.
Trust me, it'll help.

10:44.867 --> 10:47.000
(cell phone ringing)

10:48.834 --> 10:51.400
Hey, Ash. What's up?

10:51.467 --> 10:54.700
Who is it?

10:59.800 --> 11:02.867
(man hyperventilating)

11:02.934 --> 11:07.200
- I'm... having
a... a heart attack.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.633
on a cardiogram, see what's
going on here. Special occasion?

11:20.700 --> 11:22.967
- Yeah, wedding day,

11:23.033 --> 11:25.233
three of seven.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.233
- Yeah? Who's getting married?
- He is.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.100
- Did anyone come here with you?
- No.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.400
I didn't want to worry them.
- We better get you

11:33.467 --> 11:35.900
sorted out then. Any family
history of heart disease?

11:35.967 --> 11:38.066
- No.
- Your uncle had

11:38.133 --> 11:41.767
a heart attack two years ago.
- Yeah, I forgot.

11:43.633 --> 11:45.333
- Where are we at
with the cardiogram?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.333
- Just getting the reads now.
- OK.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.300
- My hands are tingling.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.433
Aah!

11:52.500 --> 11:55.033
My mouth is tingling.
- Your heart's fine.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.033
You're just having
a panic attack.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.934
- What? Really?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.967
But it feels so... real.

12:01.033 --> 12:02.767
- Yeah, well,
sometimes things do.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.867
- Panic attacks are intense.
Your body is having

12:07.934 --> 12:10.300
a fight-or-flight reaction
to stress, and weddings

12:10.367 --> 12:12.133
are stressful.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.333
I wanna check your enzymes
and troponin, but I think

12:14.400 --> 12:16.367
your heart's fine.
We'll do some bloodwork now

12:16.433 --> 12:18.333
and again in a few hours
to be sure, but I think

12:18.400 --> 12:20.600
you'll be back dancing
at your wedding in no time.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.066
- Hey, um... speaking

12:23.133 --> 12:25.467
of dancing, how's Friday night?

12:27.133 --> 12:29.900
- Oh! Yeah.

12:29.967 --> 12:31.567
- I've been meaning
to try the salsa

12:31.633 --> 12:33.433
at Lula's forever.
- Great.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.033
- I work an 8 that day,
so maybe around 9?

12:37.734 --> 12:40.266
- Yeah. That sounds fine.
I'll pick you up.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.200
- Great, it's a date.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.333
- Grace? Grace?
Stay, please.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.266
- Look to the left.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.066
Now your right.

13:00.133 --> 13:02.000
- Not fair, Doc. I couldn't
tell left from right

13:02.066 --> 13:03.800
before the head injury.
- He's very

13:03.867 --> 13:06.367
talkative
for Justin.

13:06.433 --> 13:08.934
- That's a good sign. Right?

13:10.700 --> 13:12.867
- Can you tell me
the months in the year?

13:12.934 --> 13:15.633
- February 2018.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.734
- OK. Now I'm gonna give you
a list of five words
for you to remember:

13:18.800 --> 13:20.567
cat, ball,

13:20.633 --> 13:24.400
glove, September,
happy. Got it?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.734
Can you tell me where you live?
- 962, Wellington.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.200
- No, Justin, that's
your old place.

13:31.266 --> 13:34.500
We moved in together
two months ago, remember?

13:34.567 --> 13:36.633
- Where do you work, Justin?

13:36.700 --> 13:39.734
- Kingscliff Elementary.
I teach 3rd grade.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.700
- And who are
these folks here?

13:41.767 --> 13:44.767
- Mom who makes
the best lasagna,

13:44.834 --> 13:47.266
Dad who still hasn't
forgiven me for spilling

13:47.333 --> 13:50.533
paint thinner on his car
when I was 5...

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
and...

13:55.667 --> 13:56.767
And...

13:58.633 --> 14:00.967
- You don't remember me?

14:01.033 --> 14:03.600
- Justin, what were
those words?

14:03.667 --> 14:06.967
- A cat needs
his baseball glove

14:07.033 --> 14:10.200
for tryouts in September.
And if he helps the Jays
finally win,

14:10.266 --> 14:13.266
I'll be happy!
- Excellent!

14:13.333 --> 14:15.800
Well, I'd like to run
a few more tests,

14:15.867 --> 14:17.767
but it seems as though
you've weathered

14:17.834 --> 14:19.767
this brain injury very well.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.734
The big challenge now
is going to be...

14:24.433 --> 14:27.300
...is gonna be
physical strength.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.367
Three weeks in a coma
can devastate the body.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.233
You're gonna have
to work your way back up

14:33.300 --> 14:36.567
to standing, walking,
- What about his memory?

14:36.633 --> 14:38.266
Why doesn't he remember me?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.400
- Retrograde amnesia
is very common

14:40.467 --> 14:43.467
in head injuries.
Most patients lose all memory

14:43.533 --> 14:46.767
of the accident and sometimes
weeks, even months before that.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.967
- But Justin and I have been
together for over a year now;

14:50.033 --> 14:52.100
how could he lose
that much time?

14:52.166 --> 14:53.400
- A whole year?

14:53.467 --> 14:56.000
And I don't have
a clue who you are.

14:58.533 --> 15:01.967
- You lost the hand eight months
ago in a car accident?

15:02.033 --> 15:04.133
- It's clenched
in a fist so tight,

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
it burns!
- The family doctor left

15:06.066 --> 15:09.967
standing orders for morphine
when you have an episode, so
we'll get you hooked up.

15:12.233 --> 15:13.867
- The drugs do nothing!

15:15.533 --> 15:17.467
- Opiates aren't great
for nerve pain,

15:17.533 --> 15:19.433
and what you have

15:19.500 --> 15:21.433
is a memory of a nerve pain.
Have you tried physio?

15:21.500 --> 15:24.533
- Oh, I don't know why
I came here. There's
never anything you could do.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.900
- You suffered a trauma,
it takes time to heal.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.667
- It's total crap!

15:28.734 --> 15:31.133
The pain isn't going away,
it's only getting worse.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.967
- Don't you want
to try the morphine?
- There's no point.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.033
And I'm not
doing it anymore.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.166
- Kelly... are you thinking

15:39.233 --> 15:41.367
about hurting yourself?

15:41.433 --> 15:43.300
(Kelly sniffling)
Just give me

15:43.367 --> 15:46.367
one minute.

15:48.266 --> 15:51.567
I need a form 1. I think
this patient might be suicidal.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.567
- Security!

15:57.667 --> 16:00.533
- Kelly? Kelly...

16:09.800 --> 16:11.934
- I don't understand.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Why didn't he remember me?

16:14.066 --> 16:16.300
And why wasn't he
acting like himself?

16:16.367 --> 16:18.967
- The brain's delicate.

16:19.033 --> 16:22.100
Crazy stuff could happen
with frontal-lobe injuries.

16:22.166 --> 16:26.100
- Yeah, but he's like...
a different person.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.166
- In nursing school,

16:28.233 --> 16:30.633
we studied this famous story

16:30.700 --> 16:34.000
where a guy had an iron bar
blown up the roof of his mouth.

16:34.066 --> 16:36.166
You don't need
the details.

16:36.233 --> 16:37.934
But after,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.100
he had a totally
different personality.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.200
And he kept
the iron bar as a pet.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.934
(small chuckle)
True story.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.100
- It's a terrible story.
(both chuckling)

16:51.367 --> 16:53.700
Keon, is he gonna get
his memory back?

16:53.767 --> 16:55.633
(Keon sighing)

16:55.700 --> 16:57.967
Be himself again?

16:58.033 --> 17:00.200
- I don't know.

17:00.266 --> 17:02.967
But I think you just gotta try
to be patient.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.900
(phone ringing)

17:10.834 --> 17:13.100
a prison vibe from this.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.400
Spread the word,
I'm in for a triple homicide.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.567
I don't want the other inmates
thinking I'm soft.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.400
- So wait, does that
make me Tom Hanks?

17:20.467 --> 17:22.734
- Oh, I hope not.
I don't feel up to miracles.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.300
- Haha!
- Hmm, I don't know if

17:25.367 --> 17:27.300
it's all the candy I've eaten
or the smell

17:27.367 --> 17:29.300
of the chicken salad
my mom packed,

17:29.367 --> 17:32.300
but I'm starting to feel
pretty nauseous.
- Oh no,

17:32.367 --> 17:34.900
sounds like radiation sickness
is kicking in.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.934
- Yeah, salad's gotta go.
Mom's a sweetie,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
but I can't...
Could you?

17:39.066 --> 17:41.633
- I would, but... nothing
can come out of the room

17:41.700 --> 17:43.734
until the radiation clears.
- You mean

17:43.800 --> 17:45.467
I'm stuck with rank
chicken salad smell

17:45.533 --> 17:47.266
for three days?
- Hahaha! You could try

17:47.333 --> 17:49.066
putting it in the bathroom
and closing the door.

17:49.133 --> 17:52.000
- Oh, my gag! I...

17:55.667 --> 17:58.233
- OK, so what's the verdict?
Anything?

18:02.166 --> 18:04.633
- No. Still can't
hear a thing.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.567
- OK, well, umm...

18:07.633 --> 18:10.734
We tried flushing,
we tried decongestants,

18:10.800 --> 18:13.467
I don't see anything
blocking the...

18:13.533 --> 18:15.700
Hello-lo-lo.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.767
Gloria, I found the problem:
you have an echo.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.367
Right? Humour's
the best medicine.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.900
- Not when you can't hear.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.800
- OK.

18:29.867 --> 18:32.900
That's the thing, Gloria,
I think maybe you sort of can.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.166
- Don't be ridiculous,

18:35.233 --> 18:37.533
why would I come to a hospital
if I could hear?

18:37.600 --> 18:41.333
- I honestly don't know, but...

18:43.533 --> 18:45.633
...you seem to do it
a lot, so...

18:47.400 --> 18:50.367
- What are you implying?
- There are a lot of sick people

18:50.433 --> 18:52.467
that could really use
my attention.

18:52.533 --> 18:55.033
- Do you know
how awful it is,

18:55.100 --> 18:57.033
how alone you feel
when you can't hear?

18:57.100 --> 18:59.667
- But you can.

18:59.734 --> 19:03.367
Look, I know
you're not a drug seeker,

19:03.433 --> 19:06.066
and you seem pretty good
on the marbles front.

19:06.133 --> 19:08.066
What's your deal, Gloria?
Why do you keep coming in here

19:08.133 --> 19:10.900
every week? Gloria...

19:10.967 --> 19:12.934
(Wolf sighing)
That's right,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.033
you... you can't...
you can't hear me.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.633
- If you won't help me,
I'd like a nurse who will.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.700
- It's time
for an induced discharge.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.633
Call her family to come

19:29.700 --> 19:31.633
and get her.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.166
- OK, let's look
at an emergency contact.

19:37.233 --> 19:39.834
(typing on keyboard)

19:39.900 --> 19:42.700
"Charlie..." Oh, my gosh!

19:56.633 --> 19:59.600
(indistinct intercom message)

19:59.667 --> 20:02.467
(sighing)

20:04.533 --> 20:06.600
- I've got this.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.567
- Are you sure?
I thought you were on break.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.367
- Yeah. Thanks.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.233
- I was hoping
I'd see you again.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.834
- Yeah, well, I'd feel guilty
if I didn't check on you.

20:16.900 --> 20:20.133
And at least this way,
I get to stab you.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.533
- We need to talk, OK?
It's important.
- Yeah, it must be,

20:22.600 --> 20:25.133
if you had a panic attack
during your wedding.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.433
- Yeah, I tried to call you.
- I locked your number.

20:29.367 --> 20:32.100
- About... about the rumours
with Dr. Hamilton--

20:32.166 --> 20:35.367
- (murmuring): Shh! No, we can't
talk about this, not here!
- I need to tell you of the NDA.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.133
- No.
- Kabir!

20:38.700 --> 20:40.867
I was so worried.

20:40.934 --> 20:43.567
He had a panic attack?
Is... is he OK?

20:43.633 --> 20:45.934
- Yeah. He should be fine.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.567
I'm just gonna take these
for an enzyme check

20:48.633 --> 20:50.767
and then you should be able
to take him home.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.100
- Do I know you?
You look familiar.

20:53.166 --> 20:56.066
- Uh... you met Grace

20:56.133 --> 20:58.800
at the General a year ago
at the Christmas party.

20:58.867 --> 21:01.333
We used to work together.
- Oh, wow!

21:01.400 --> 21:03.934
And now at the merger.
Back together again, huh?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.333
(nervous laugh)
- Right.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.200
Anyways, um, I am going
to take these to get checked,

21:09.266 --> 21:12.200
and then you should
be good to go.

21:12.266 --> 21:15.133
- One second. Grace? Um...

21:15.200 --> 21:17.200
it's so good

21:17.266 --> 21:19.533
to see you again.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.867
You deserve better than
what you got from the General,

21:23.934 --> 21:25.867
from all of us.

21:29.967 --> 21:33.300
- Congratulations.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.600
(knocking)

21:52.700 --> 21:55.033
(phone ringing)

21:56.734 --> 21:59.900
- Do you think a person could
actually barf themselves
inside out?

21:59.967 --> 22:03.033
- Haha!
- Can you give me something?

22:03.100 --> 22:06.133
A shot of Gravol?
Bullet to the head?
- I wish that I could,

22:06.200 --> 22:08.100
but that would mean
going into the room.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.100
- What's the worst
that could happen?

22:10.166 --> 22:12.233
- I could nuke my ovaries.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.800
- Kids are overrated.
- Or I could expose

22:14.867 --> 22:17.133
one of my other patients
to radiation.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.467
Hospitals take rules
very seriously,

22:19.533 --> 22:22.633
and I really can't afford
to break any right now.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.867
But I can talk to you on
the phone to keep you company.

22:25.934 --> 22:29.266
- OK, fine,
but you have to be

22:29.333 --> 22:31.633
miserable too.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.800
I want your most
embarrassing stories.

22:33.867 --> 22:36.600
Anything to make me
feel better about how crappy

22:36.667 --> 22:38.667
my life is right now.
- Oh, trust me,

22:38.734 --> 22:42.233
we will not get through
all of them in three days.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.967
(indistinct speaking)
(phone ringing)

22:45.033 --> 22:47.367
- You did the right thing.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.934
Kelly is not a depressed person
or prone to hurting herself,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.033
but she's had a huge life
adjustment, and intense pain is

22:54.100 --> 22:56.266
really hard to deal with.
- But she'll get better,

22:56.333 --> 22:58.867
won't she,
once this episode passes?

22:58.934 --> 23:02.400
- She needs to find
a healthy way to cope long term.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.433
If phantom pain persists

23:04.500 --> 23:06.433
for more than six months,
it doesn't usually go away.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.800
- It's already been
eight months.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.600
- You ratted me out,

23:24.667 --> 23:28.533
got me committed.
- Just for 24 hours.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.333
I thought Dr. Niven could help.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.166
- I used
to play tennis,

23:35.233 --> 23:36.934
Olympic track.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
- Wow!
- When I lost
my hand, I stopped.

23:41.567 --> 23:43.133
- Why? There are
amazing prosthetics.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.000
- But you can't
compete professionally.

23:45.066 --> 23:47.300
So, I tried to play
with my other hand, but it was

23:47.367 --> 23:51.500
all wrong! I kept trying
to swing with my missing hand.

23:51.567 --> 23:54.233
It was like playing
with a ghost.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.200
- Kelly, I think
I understand.

23:57.266 --> 23:59.200
I have my brother's eyes.

23:59.266 --> 24:02.033
He was my twin. He died.

24:02.100 --> 24:05.333
- I'm sorry.
- I see him

24:05.400 --> 24:08.333
every time I look
in the mirror.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.767
It's almost like
he's still with me,

24:11.834 --> 24:14.033
he's still
a part of me.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.500
- If I'm always
gonna be in pain,

24:19.567 --> 24:22.834
if I can't even
play tennis anymore,

24:22.900 --> 24:24.867
what's the point?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.667
- I'll be right back.

24:33.133 --> 24:35.934
(indistinct basketball match
description playing on phone)

24:37.834 --> 24:40.567
- Is that the game?

24:40.633 --> 24:42.567
- They've got
a day game.

24:42.633 --> 24:45.033
- Wow! Lucky you,
those are rare.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.066
I'm Keon, I'm a nurse.

24:47.133 --> 24:50.333
I work with your mom,
and I am a huge Raptors fan.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.700
- Me too!

24:51.767 --> 24:53.900
- How are we doing so far?

24:53.967 --> 24:56.633
- Bad. Kawhi is
not playing again!

24:56.700 --> 24:58.767
- What?! You're not a fan
of load management?

24:58.834 --> 25:01.033
- You mean taking
the night off?

25:01.100 --> 25:03.900
(Keon laughing)
(match description stopping)

25:03.967 --> 25:06.100
- Aaah...
- Ugh!

25:06.166 --> 25:08.100
It's buffering again.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.333
Mom and Dad used
to take me to games,

25:10.400 --> 25:13.300
but not since
the divorce.

25:13.367 --> 25:15.333
- Tickets are pricy.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.533
- That's what Dad says.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.033
Mom just... just doesn't
have time.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.533
- Pro tip? Download the game

25:25.600 --> 25:28.233
after it's done, then watch.
It's easier on crummy

25:28.300 --> 25:30.133
hospital Wi-Fi.
- Thanks.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.900
- Any time. Pfff!

25:32.967 --> 25:34.934
We the North!

25:35.000 --> 25:37.200
Is that...? Not scary,
I'm just...

25:37.266 --> 25:39.233
"We the North." You know that.
OK, I'm gonna stop talking.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.767
Good to meet you.

25:41.834 --> 25:46.133
- And this was in Cape Cod.
- It's weird

25:46.200 --> 25:48.300
seeing myself somewhere
I've never been before.

25:52.667 --> 25:55.734
- Aha! I was afraid to go

25:55.800 --> 25:58.567
on the ocean because I thought
a lobster would get me,

25:58.633 --> 26:01.166
so you bought me this.
And you kept hiding it

26:01.233 --> 26:04.066
in places to scare me--
- Do we have to do this

26:04.133 --> 26:05.834
right now?
- Good news,

26:05.900 --> 26:08.600
gang! Time to get you
out of that bed.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.633
I'm gonna take you
to physio,

26:10.700 --> 26:13.166
get you walking on the bars,

26:13.233 --> 26:15.133
so we can assess
your strength. But first,

26:15.200 --> 26:17.233
we gotta get you out
of that gown and in some gear.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.333
- I don't mind
getting changed by a nurse,

26:19.400 --> 26:22.834
but... not in front of... her.

26:22.900 --> 26:26.233
- Justin, I'm your fiancée,
we live together.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.033
- I told you I don't know you.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.166
- Sorry, Maddie, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

26:34.233 --> 26:35.967
- It's OK.

26:39.367 --> 26:42.800
- So I gave him the longest
piece of medical tape
you've ever seen,

26:42.867 --> 26:45.233
so that he could fix
his time machine.

26:45.300 --> 26:48.633
- What happened? Did he
make it back to the future?
- No, my preceptor yelled at me

26:48.700 --> 26:50.834
for giving medical supplies
to a psych patient.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.200
But who was I to interfere
with interdimensional travel?

26:53.266 --> 26:55.867
- You're funny, Grace.

26:55.934 --> 26:58.367
You almost made me forget
I want to die.

26:58.433 --> 27:00.967
- Well, I used to be.

27:01.033 --> 27:03.100
I haven't really felt
like myself in a while.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.233
- What happened?

27:07.166 --> 27:09.066
- Are you drinking enough water?

27:09.133 --> 27:11.467
You ate a lot of candy,
and it raised your blood sugar.

27:11.533 --> 27:13.500
Plus with all
the vomiting and...

27:15.800 --> 27:19.834
Aaah... my last job
changed things.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.800
I'm trying to get back
to myself, but it's hard.

27:25.166 --> 27:27.934
- My life was going great.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.600
I got one of the last print jobs
in journalism,

27:31.667 --> 27:35.433
kicking butt
and taking names,

27:35.500 --> 27:40.300
and then... wham, cancer.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.967
My boss took me off
the kick-butt assignments

27:43.033 --> 27:45.500
to give me
"more time to recover,"

27:45.567 --> 27:48.000
which was crap.
He just heard cancer

27:48.066 --> 27:50.900
and wrote my career off
as over before it even started.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.934
I feel like

27:56.000 --> 27:58.367
this bad thing happened to me

27:58.433 --> 28:01.400
and it derailed everything,

28:01.467 --> 28:04.200
and now I just don't even know
who I am anymore.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.867
- Do you think
that we can get it back?

28:08.934 --> 28:10.967
The people that we used to be?

28:12.667 --> 28:14.033
- Yeah.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.533
But you gotta push out
all the poison

28:18.600 --> 28:20.533
that changed you first.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.300
And it ain't easy.

28:24.367 --> 28:27.400
Takes a lot of guts.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.133
(retching noises)

28:32.200 --> 28:33.934
- (Keon): I know it's hard, man.
Come on, one step

28:34.000 --> 28:35.934
at a time, buddy!
- Come on, you can do it.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.867
- You're doing great.
That's it, there it is.

28:37.934 --> 28:40.467
- Stupid legs!

28:40.533 --> 28:41.934
I feel so weak.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.834
- Just a couple
more steps, Justin.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.834
Ah! It's OK, it's OK.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.800
Up you go, up you go. It's OK.
- I can't!

28:48.867 --> 28:50.800
No more!
- Come on, J! Yes, you can!

28:50.867 --> 28:53.100
- I said, "No more."
- I know you can do it--

28:53.166 --> 28:55.633
- You don't know me!
- OK, that's a great start.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.000
- I do know you.
I know how strong you are.

28:58.066 --> 29:00.367
- I want you to go!
- He'll feel more like himself

29:00.433 --> 29:02.567
when he's had some rest.
- I am myself!

29:02.633 --> 29:04.200
Why doesn't anyone
get that?!

29:06.433 --> 29:08.834
We're done!

29:08.900 --> 29:12.700
- Come on, J.
This is our life. Huh?

29:14.600 --> 29:16.433
Justin...

29:25.767 --> 29:28.400
You're making a mistake.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.266
- How was I supposed to know?
He's wearing all black.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.233
- I want to hear

29:39.300 --> 29:42.100
about accidental goth guy,
I've just got to...

29:49.567 --> 29:51.767
I didn't think I could be...

29:53.600 --> 29:56.400
- Quinn! Quinn!

29:56.467 --> 29:58.667
(knocking on window)
Quinn, can you hear me?
Are you OK?

29:58.734 --> 30:01.567
(beeping)
(suspenseful music)

30:10.133 --> 30:12.500
Hey, Quinn?

30:12.567 --> 30:14.500
Quinn, are you alright?

30:14.567 --> 30:16.533
Quinn, can you hear me?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.533
It's gonna be alright.

30:22.166 --> 30:24.734
- Oh. Um, that...
that's great.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.867
(sigh of relief)
- OK.

30:27.934 --> 30:29.900
Let's get you hooked up.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.734
- Look, I know
what you're gonna say.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.066
It was stupid, and I risked
nuking my ovaries for nothing.

31:00.133 --> 31:03.400
- Your ovaries are not
my concern; your complete
lack of judgment is!

31:03.467 --> 31:06.000
Why are you not wearing
a lead apron?

31:06.066 --> 31:09.000
Stay back! You exposed
yourself to radiation!

31:09.066 --> 31:10.533
- My patient collapsed,
what was I supposed to do?

31:10.600 --> 31:12.367
- Make sure
she doesn't collapse!

31:12.433 --> 31:15.066
- She was dehydrated, and
her blood sugar was elevated.

31:15.133 --> 31:16.900
- You should have started an IV
before she went into isolation!

31:16.967 --> 31:19.500
- Only person who was
at risk here was me!

31:19.567 --> 31:21.700
- You're damn right.

31:21.767 --> 31:23.567
The peer review finds
mistakes in your charts,

31:23.633 --> 31:25.467
instances of poor judgment.

31:25.533 --> 31:28.333
Seeing this,
I understand why.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.900
- What does that mean?
- It means they're opening up

31:30.967 --> 31:33.567
an official case
with standards and practice.

31:33.633 --> 31:35.567
There'll be an investigation.

31:35.633 --> 31:38.967
You're suspended
pending the review!

31:39.033 --> 31:41.000
Now, hit the shower
and get out!

31:41.066 --> 31:43.800
(exhaling)

31:43.867 --> 31:46.333
- Grace, what happened?
- We heard you got suspended.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.967
- Stay back, I'm radioactive.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.700
- Is that like a metaphor?
- No.

31:49.767 --> 31:52.166
- Are you OK?

31:52.233 --> 31:55.166
- No.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.233
- Morphine does nothing

32:06.300 --> 32:08.700
but a mirror's supposed to help?
- You're in pain

32:08.767 --> 32:11.467
because your brain can't accept
that your hand is gone.

32:11.533 --> 32:13.400
It fixates because it thinks
your hand is in crisis.

32:13.467 --> 32:16.133
So, maybe your brain
just needs

32:16.200 --> 32:18.400
to see the hand
for itself,

32:18.467 --> 32:20.967
see that it's OK?

32:25.100 --> 32:27.000
Mirror box therapy
is effective

32:27.066 --> 32:29.033
in 60% of phantom cases.

32:29.100 --> 32:32.200
- That's your big pitch,
those odds?

32:32.266 --> 32:35.467
- Winning 60% of games
is still a lot better

32:35.533 --> 32:37.300
than just not playing.

32:37.367 --> 32:39.333
Isn't it?

32:43.934 --> 32:46.467
So, the affected limb
goes in here.

32:50.967 --> 32:53.867
- Ow!

32:53.934 --> 32:55.734
Owww!

32:57.266 --> 32:58.633
- Now, don't look
at the affected hand,

32:58.700 --> 33:01.266
just focus on the reflection.

33:01.333 --> 33:04.133
(soft music)

33:14.133 --> 33:16.600
(Kelly chuckling)

33:16.667 --> 33:19.967
- I know it's an illusion...

33:21.667 --> 33:25.000
...I know it's not real,
but... but I swear

33:25.066 --> 33:27.500
I can feel
my missing hand.

33:27.567 --> 33:29.633
Hahaha!

33:29.700 --> 33:32.433
- Now, we tell your brain

33:32.500 --> 33:34.367
that the phantom limb
is relaxed.

33:34.433 --> 33:38.333
So first, show it the hand
clenched in a fist.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.500
Now slowly...

33:42.567 --> 33:44.500
release.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.367
(Kelly sighing)

33:58.400 --> 34:00.533
Uh, are you OK?
We can stop.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.633
- No.

34:02.700 --> 34:05.000
I can feel it

34:05.066 --> 34:06.767
letting go.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.900
(Kelly laughing)

34:18.633 --> 34:20.567
(Kelly chuckling)
- If you practice

34:20.633 --> 34:22.567
with the mirror,

34:22.633 --> 34:24.600
over time, it can
alleviate your pain.

34:26.266 --> 34:28.467
(chuckling)
- (murmuring): Thank you.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.367
- Why are we out here? How is
this gonna fix my hearing?

34:35.433 --> 34:37.333
- I honestly don't know
what's wrong with you,

34:37.400 --> 34:39.433
but it's my lunch break, so...

34:45.166 --> 34:46.533
Turkey Swiss?

34:49.934 --> 34:51.767
Keep an eye on it.

34:51.834 --> 34:53.867
There's this really
aggressive crow around here.

34:53.934 --> 34:55.900
I lost half
a taquito last week.

35:06.900 --> 35:09.100
- This is nice.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.100
I haven't sat outside like this
since Charlie died.

35:14.166 --> 35:17.633
- That was
three years ago, right?

35:28.500 --> 35:30.400
You know...

35:30.467 --> 35:33.467
I come out here on most days
on my lunch break

35:33.533 --> 35:35.467
when the weather's nice.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.367
- If I'm in the neighbourhood,
maybe I'll join you.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.367
Hey!

35:44.333 --> 35:46.433
My hearing's come back.

35:53.367 --> 35:56.166
Next time, bring pickles.

35:56.233 --> 35:58.834
- We can do pickles.

37:02.533 --> 37:06.033
- Um, excuse me. Hi.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.567
I'm looking
for a nurse. Noelle?

37:08.633 --> 37:10.800
- Uh, yep, that's me.

37:10.867 --> 37:12.800
- Did you work
at City General?

37:14.867 --> 37:16.600
- OK, have a seat, sweetie.

37:18.333 --> 37:21.133
I've one more consult, and then
we can get out of here, OK?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.667
I'll get you some hot chocolate
while you wait.

37:22.734 --> 37:24.266
- Mm-hmm.

37:26.667 --> 37:29.166
- Cece. Um, you know

37:29.233 --> 37:31.400
anybody that can help get these
Raptor tickets off my hand?

37:31.467 --> 37:33.734
I got a buddy from college,
he works PR.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.867
- Keon, hey.

37:35.934 --> 37:37.600
- What's up?

37:39.633 --> 37:42.133
- What do you think you're doing
trying to take my kid to
a basketball game?

37:42.200 --> 37:44.867
- What?! No, I would...
I would never!

37:44.934 --> 37:46.934
The tickets are
for you and Cece.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.800
You were just saying

37:48.867 --> 37:51.166
you don't get to spend
enough time with her.

37:51.233 --> 37:54.567
- Sorry, I'm on edge.

37:54.633 --> 37:56.934
My ex is trying to reopen
our custody agreement

37:57.000 --> 37:58.800
because of my work schedule.
- That's a dick move.

37:58.867 --> 38:01.400
- Yeah. Like a whopping alimony
isn't enough.

38:01.467 --> 38:03.934
He wants Cece full time?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And the thing is...

38:06.066 --> 38:08.100
he's right. I mean,
because of my job,

38:08.166 --> 38:10.800
Cece spends most of her time
together with the nanny.

38:10.867 --> 38:14.633
- She's great by the way.
Come on, I didn't
tell her about us.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.433
I just said I'm a nurse
that works with her mom,

38:16.500 --> 38:19.567
which I am.
But I could do more.

38:19.633 --> 38:22.033
I'm a great babysitter,
especially if she
can talk sports.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.066
- Yeah, great. What would that
do for my custody situation

38:25.133 --> 38:27.567
if my ex finds out
I left our kid with my hookup.

38:30.567 --> 38:32.467
- I'm a hookup?

38:34.266 --> 38:36.233
- You were supposed to be.

38:38.133 --> 38:39.800
- Was I? 'Cause
that's not what I thought.

38:39.867 --> 38:42.834
- I told you that my kid
and my practice come first.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.800
OK, I mean we agreed.
You can't just start

38:44.867 --> 38:47.767
pushing yourself into my life.
- You can't keep hiding
behind bullshit.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.967
- I made it very clear

38:52.033 --> 38:54.567
what this relationship
could and could not be.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.567
That won't change, so you need
to decide if you're OK
with that.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.300
Let's go, sweetie.
Come on!

39:05.767 --> 39:08.300
Thank you. OK, let's go.

39:08.367 --> 39:10.500
- (woman): I always wanted
to work in the OR.

39:10.567 --> 39:12.667
Dr. Hamilton said
that I had what it took,

39:12.734 --> 39:16.100
and that he would mentor me.
- For a price.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.200
- 'Til I threatened
to report him,

39:18.266 --> 39:21.000
go to administration.
- Then he got you fired.

39:22.934 --> 39:25.700
(Grace sighing)
- He ruined my career,

39:25.767 --> 39:28.333
my reputation.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.600
I couldn't get a job
in another hospital.

39:32.633 --> 39:34.567
After what happened,
I don't think

39:34.633 --> 39:37.266
I would trust myself
in the OR again anyway.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.900
What if he is right?
What if I am a bad nurse?

39:42.967 --> 39:46.000
- But you aren't.

39:46.066 --> 39:48.934
You know, I was...
afraid of him too.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.100
Right up until he tried
to get me to sign the NDA.

39:53.166 --> 39:55.500
And that's when I knew

39:55.567 --> 39:57.900
that he was afraid of me.

39:57.967 --> 40:00.400
And he's afraid
of you too, Noelle.

40:00.467 --> 40:03.133
That why he got you to sign.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.266
He knows that either of us
could take him down

40:05.333 --> 40:07.266
with our stories.

40:07.333 --> 40:09.600
Now, imagine
what we could do together.

40:30.467 --> 40:32.166
- Maddie?

40:34.333 --> 40:35.934
You OK?

40:36.000 --> 40:39.867
- I, uh...
I should have gone home,

40:39.934 --> 40:42.133
but...

40:42.200 --> 40:44.333
God, I've just spent...

40:44.400 --> 40:46.934
three weeks
in this hospital waiting.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.834
I just couldn't face

40:49.900 --> 40:52.233
moving my stuff
out of our place.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.800
- Is there anything I can do?
- Explain to me

40:54.867 --> 40:56.567
how I got here.

40:58.467 --> 41:01.567
One minute, I had
a great relationship...

41:03.600 --> 41:05.533
...and now I don't.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.734
(touching piano music)

41:10.600 --> 41:14.033
I love Justin, so...

41:14.100 --> 41:16.033
this is gonna sound...

41:19.433 --> 41:22.033
It's almost worse
than if he died.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.567
Because he's gone...

41:26.600 --> 41:29.000
...but not gone.

41:29.066 --> 41:31.500
What am I supposed to do?

41:33.500 --> 41:36.367
Just move on and forget him
like he forgot me?

41:47.100 --> 41:49.600
- You can't force yourself
into someone's life.

41:49.667 --> 41:52.433
(Maddie sobbing)

41:55.633 --> 41:57.900
Even if you know
you're good for them.

42:03.734 --> 42:06.500
'Cause if they can't
give you what you need...

42:08.300 --> 42:12.633
...you have to let them go.
(Maddie sobbing)

42:26.166 --> 42:29.867
- (woman): Sometimes, you see
yourself reflected in a mirror,

42:29.934 --> 42:33.200
and sometimes
reflected in someone else.

42:33.266 --> 42:36.300
It might be someone you miss...

42:36.367 --> 42:39.533

43:37.066 --> 43:38.600

43:43.700 --> 43:46.100
ready to be a kickass
journalist again?

43:46.166 --> 43:48.367
'Cause we've got
