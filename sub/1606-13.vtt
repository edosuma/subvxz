01:25.035 --> 01:26.036
The big guns.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.705
Think they're so boss
'cause they wear suits.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.333
Stupid SIS. Why are they even here?

01:30.416 --> 01:32.876
Well, a stabbing and a
slocking back-to-back...

01:32.960 --> 01:34.753
It's turned into fucking
Rikers around here.

01:34.837 --> 01:37.214
You know they're gonna grill
the COs as hard as the inmates.

01:37.297 --> 01:40.258
Those dicks are all dying to nail us.

01:40.343 --> 01:42.260
Gentlemen, good morning.

01:44.221 --> 01:47.850
Welcome to Litchfield. Enjoy your stay.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.564
Kiss ass.

01:55.483 --> 01:59.069
Gentlemen, nice to see
you. Captain Joe Caputo.

01:59.152 --> 02:00.363
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:00.446 --> 02:02.280
Uh, I thought we could meet in my office

02:02.365 --> 02:06.785
and go over the details of the incident
before you begin your investigation.

02:06.869 --> 02:09.413
Well, we report to Miss Figueroa.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.957
Right, well, I believe I
can provide more information.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.960
Miss Figueroa wasn't
on campus that evening.

02:15.043 --> 02:17.463
We have instructions to
meet with her exclusively.

02:17.546 --> 02:19.798
We'll interview you
along with the other COs

02:19.882 --> 02:20.883
when the time comes.

02:22.593 --> 02:25.220
Sure, sure. I'll show you to her office.

02:25.303 --> 02:27.765
Some coffee would be great, too.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.933
Light. Two sugars.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.936
♪ Swing low ♪

02:33.020 --> 02:34.397
Guess it could be worse.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.942
Back in the day, they would have us
out on some back road breaking rocks.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.236
Yeah, on the other hand...

02:41.319 --> 02:45.658
Paulie in Goodfellas had the joint wired,
cookin' big-ass dinners every night.

02:46.617 --> 02:49.662
Italians have weird
shit with their mothers.

02:49.745 --> 02:52.080
They, like, live with
them for way too long.

02:53.582 --> 02:56.960
We all got weird shit with our mamas.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.088
Hey... what you gonna say
when they ask you about Red?

03:00.172 --> 03:02.925
That I didn't see shit,
'cause I didn't see shit.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.510
But, come on, you know who did it.

03:04.593 --> 03:05.594
Mmm...

03:05.678 --> 03:08.472
Oh, my gosh! Who? Who?

03:08.556 --> 03:11.725
Damn, you can't be doin' that shit. I
got a family history of heart attacks.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.145
Sorry, I mean, I'm sorry. All right?

03:15.228 --> 03:17.773
I just came to check
on the family business.

03:17.856 --> 03:20.651
You know, we gotta keep
these accounts full, right?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.820
And then you began to chat.

03:23.821 --> 03:26.031
Italians do love their mamas.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.326
So...

03:34.247 --> 03:36.083
Is there something you want to ask me?

03:36.834 --> 03:38.210
- Mmm-mmm.
- Nope.

03:38.293 --> 03:41.421
Shit, I'm gonna answer anyway. Yes.

03:42.214 --> 03:44.299
Vee, you know we ain't gonna say shit.

03:44.382 --> 03:45.551
Yes, you are, sweetheart.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.637
You are going to say...

03:50.138 --> 03:53.767
"You know that Warren girl is unstable?

03:53.851 --> 03:59.231
"She has a history of violence,
a melodramatic notion of loyalty.

03:59.314 --> 04:02.150
"But please go easy on
her because, you know what,

04:02.234 --> 04:04.444
"even a double cray need
a little bit of help."

04:04.528 --> 04:07.364
They will probably come to this
conclusion on their own, eventually,

04:07.447 --> 04:10.117
but it doesn't hurt to
give 'em a little push.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.872
I know she Fruity Pebbles,
but, man, that's cold.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.708
Is it? Really?

04:17.791 --> 04:22.546
Is it cold for Amazon to underprice
books just to capture market-share?

04:22.630 --> 04:27.885
No, it seems to me that as
shareholders in this company,

04:27.968 --> 04:31.221
you are immune to the cold.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.890
Just like polar bears.

04:32.973 --> 04:38.604
Not sure cheap books is the
same as pinning shit on Crazy.

04:38.687 --> 04:41.732
Ain't you worried Red's gonna wake
up and tell them what happened?

04:41.815 --> 04:45.027
Nope, that is not how OGs
like Red handle their business.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.486
You've got your script.

04:47.780 --> 04:48.822
Follow it.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.743
'Cause there are always
more socks, baby girl.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.495
Always more locks.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.958
Enemies?

05:00.042 --> 05:03.671
Well, Red and Vee, they had history.

05:04.922 --> 05:07.675
The Vee that you
referenced is Yvonne Parker?

05:07.758 --> 05:09.509
Yeah, yeah, that's her.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.095
Bad seed.

05:12.179 --> 05:16.934
You can feel it when you're
around her, her bad seediness.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.395
She is the one that made things hardcore.

05:20.478 --> 05:22.815
I mean, it's not like
prison was summer camp,

05:22.898 --> 05:25.609
but we all sort of got along.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.070
At least nobody was
trying to kill each other.

05:28.153 --> 05:31.740
Now, it's like Serbo-Croatia up in here.

05:31.824 --> 05:34.827
You have a close relationship
with Reznikov, correct?

05:34.910 --> 05:38.956
Don't call her that. Her
name's Red, all right?

05:39.039 --> 05:40.833
Nicknames don't suit our official purpose.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.334
Oh, yeah. Yeah, well,

05:42.417 --> 05:46.129
treating her like she's not
a person doesn't suit me.

05:46.213 --> 05:50.968
Hey, look, just do your job and
find the asshole who did it, okay?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.971
All right, you'd know this by now
if you were any good at your job.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.513
It was Vee.

05:55.598 --> 05:58.100
Parker, for your official purposes.

05:59.267 --> 06:02.605
I think it's the black one. I
don't know. The one with the hair.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.149
Her real name can't be Crazy Eyes.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.401
I don't know. She's the crazy one.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.904
She already be, like,
throwing pie all the time...

06:10.988 --> 06:14.532
but this is, like,
next-level crazy, you know?

06:14.617 --> 06:15.659
Rude.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.079
That Vee, she's a very rude person.

06:22.791 --> 06:24.334
I don't like rude.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.920
- It was Crazy Eyes.
- Yes.

06:27.004 --> 06:28.714
But do you happen to know her real name?

06:28.797 --> 06:31.008
Suzanne Warren.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.010
You're sure?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.511
Positive.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.555
I was attacked from behind.

06:38.724 --> 06:40.058
I saw nothing.

06:40.142 --> 06:42.102
No one.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.690
I'm an old woman trying
to grow something green.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.984
I don't know who would do this to me.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.795
Chapman.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.422
Mr. Caputo.

07:11.757 --> 07:13.967
I like what you've done with the place.

07:15.302 --> 07:19.890
Sadly, you know, it's starting
to feel like home in here.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.809
You know I had no choice but to punish you.

07:21.892 --> 07:23.811
You broke into administrative offices.

07:25.353 --> 07:27.981
You said someone asked you to steal these.

07:29.066 --> 07:30.233
Who?

07:30.317 --> 07:33.904
I thought you weren't
interested in what I had to say.

07:35.698 --> 07:38.658
There's a year's worth of invoices in here.

07:38.742 --> 07:40.327
Someone building a case?

07:42.037 --> 07:45.916
'Cause I got a pretty good idea
where you're going with this...

07:45.999 --> 07:47.417
but I'd like some details.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.795
You...

07:49.878 --> 07:52.255
you were kind to me when I got here.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.424
You let me make that
phone call to my fiancé.

07:54.507 --> 07:58.929
- What's your point?
- My point is that you're a good person.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.680
And Miss Figueroa...

08:02.766 --> 08:03.851
she isn't.

08:05.978 --> 08:06.979
Is she embezzling?

08:07.062 --> 08:09.940
You seem like someone
who cares about his job.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.275
And frankly, you know,

08:12.359 --> 08:14.778
I think this would be a better
place if you were in charge.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.654
Get to the fucking point.

08:17.781 --> 08:18.782
You're in seg, kid.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.827
I'd be more than happy
to leave you in here.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.121
Now tell me exactly what you were planning.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.372
I was gonna take her out.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.127
"Take her out."

08:33.421 --> 08:34.422
How?

08:34.506 --> 08:36.799
Those files...

08:36.884 --> 08:39.803
are a small piece of a much
bigger case against her.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.222
I wanna know who your
contact is on the outside.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.974
You don't even need him.

08:44.057 --> 08:48.020
I can explain to you everything
that is in that folder.

08:48.103 --> 08:51.648
I will give you all of the
ammunition you need, I promise.

08:52.607 --> 08:54.651
I will tell you everything.

08:58.906 --> 08:59.907
If?

09:01.033 --> 09:02.700
If you stop my transfer.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.167
I got you now, you dirty bitch.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.253
Jesus.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.173
What's going on in here?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.342
You wearing sweatpants?

09:19.426 --> 09:21.053
They're slacks.

09:23.221 --> 09:26.516
All right. All right, you
gotta... you gotta breathe.

09:26.599 --> 09:27.767
Hey, hey, hey.

09:29.061 --> 09:32.230
Hey, take... take a deep breath.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on now.

09:33.857 --> 09:35.192
Jason...

09:35.275 --> 09:36.526
Joe. I'm... I'm Joe.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.196
No, my husband is Jason.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.824
Huh. What happened to him? He get arrested?

09:41.907 --> 09:42.950
No!

09:44.076 --> 09:47.079
He's having an affair with a...

09:48.872 --> 09:52.625
man named... Gavin.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.214
Gavin?

09:58.631 --> 10:01.384
Jeez. Yikes.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.720
He's in love.

10:04.679 --> 10:06.598
Wow.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.600
That's, uh...

10:08.683 --> 10:09.726
Wow.

10:09.809 --> 10:14.814
How did I not know? What's wrong with me?

10:14.898 --> 10:16.483
You had no idea?

10:16.566 --> 10:20.320
A lot of men shave their balls.
It doesn't mean they're gay.

10:20.403 --> 10:22.906
You know it's not you, right?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.992
Hey, you gotta know that, huh?

10:25.075 --> 10:27.327
People are born a certain way, you know...

10:30.998 --> 10:33.083
He used to love me.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.253
I'm sure he did.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.339
Oh, Christ, look at me.

10:39.422 --> 10:41.925
I used to be so... hot.

10:42.009 --> 10:46.263
Now I'm... hard and... wrinkled.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.765
You're still hot, Fig.

10:48.848 --> 10:54.521
- I mean, you're a horrible person...
- but you're sexy as hell.

10:55.688 --> 10:56.689
Really?

10:56.773 --> 10:58.316
Yeah.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.692
Thanks.

11:02.112 --> 11:06.324
Hell, after all that money
you embezzled for him...

11:08.994 --> 11:10.828
Wait, what? What are you talking about?

11:10.913 --> 11:13.290
Embezzlement. Fraud.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.543
I've got your files.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.837
You've been a bad girl.

11:19.922 --> 11:23.133
And if I was your daddy,
I'd spank you real good...

11:26.053 --> 11:27.345
but I'm not.

11:27.429 --> 11:30.723
I'm just the schmuck who's
been cleaning up your crap

11:30.807 --> 11:33.185
for too long and I'm done.

11:34.227 --> 11:38.440
You're a goddamn criminal, Mrs. Fagueroa.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.857
Get out.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.235
Fine.

11:42.319 --> 11:43.987
No, wait, stop. You can't.

11:44.821 --> 11:48.783
I can't? Suck my dick, Natalie.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.578
Okay.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.458
Wait, what?

12:02.089 --> 12:03.715
Holy shit.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.384
Holy shit!

12:06.468 --> 12:09.762
Yeah, they used to call
me beer can in high school.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.482
Ah... Ah, teeth, teeth.

12:20.565 --> 12:21.691
Sorry.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.286
So we're good?

12:33.370 --> 12:35.455
I do like you down on your knees.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.044
Christ, you should... never speak. Uh...

12:41.128 --> 12:43.005
The files. You'll shut up?

12:43.088 --> 12:46.383
Oh, I... I already gave 'em to the warden.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.925
He's got copies of everything.

12:50.762 --> 12:51.763
Bye, Nat.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.063
Fuck!

13:01.273 --> 13:04.109
Why didn't you say anything to SIS?

13:04.192 --> 13:06.278
Why would you protect that woman?

13:07.279 --> 13:11.074
That woman can weasel
her way out of anything.

13:11.866 --> 13:14.786
I'm handling this my way.

13:15.745 --> 13:17.205
She cracked your eye socket.

13:17.289 --> 13:18.498
Hmm, it will heal.

13:18.581 --> 13:23.586
And this gives me time to plan in peace.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.089
Oh-ho.

13:27.215 --> 13:28.466
Ooh.

13:29.134 --> 13:31.053
Kind of hard to plan when
you can't even sit up.

13:31.136 --> 13:35.014
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo...

13:36.516 --> 13:39.436
I used to take the boys to Coney Island.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.397
They loved the spinning rides.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.275
They called them the "Mamochka drunk rides"

13:45.358 --> 13:48.528
because I'd always get
off nauseous and stumbling.

13:49.487 --> 13:52.031
Little shits thought it was hilarious.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.327
This is the same feeling...

13:55.410 --> 13:59.539
but without three little boys
pointing and laughing at me.

13:59.622 --> 14:02.500
You should let the
administration handle this.

14:03.126 --> 14:05.128
Oh.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.589
I should trust the administration...

14:07.672 --> 14:11.176
while they're force-feeding
you through tubes.

14:11.968 --> 14:14.053
Huh?

14:15.012 --> 14:16.639
Salient point.

14:18.141 --> 14:21.519
Look, please tell me that Fig
keeps a vibrator in her desk.

14:21.603 --> 14:24.647
'Cause I have this
crystal-clear image in my head

14:24.731 --> 14:28.318
of her there, feet up, high
heels knocking over the pen cup

14:28.401 --> 14:32.447
while she just goes to town on
her clit with a pocket rocket.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.741
Her drawers are full
of snacks and wrappers.

14:34.824 --> 14:38.578
Oh, come on. Man, don't tell me that.

14:38.661 --> 14:40.997
I don't wanna think of her
as a bulimic with barf breath.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.665
It's just so...

14:42.749 --> 14:45.668
Good news though. Caputo
canceled my transfer.

14:45.752 --> 14:50.507
Ah! Whoopie. You get
to stay here... in hell.

14:50.590 --> 14:56.053
Hey, maybe you'll get slocked to
death by a psychotic heroin dealer.

14:56.138 --> 14:57.722
How's Red?

14:57.805 --> 15:00.600
Alive. It's all I know.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.312
And that's a fucking miracle, you know.

15:04.396 --> 15:08.400
Not a ton of news coming out
of the medical unit, so...

15:09.442 --> 15:10.652
I'm sorry, Nicky.

15:12.237 --> 15:15.323
No, I mean, those ass clowns
launched their bullshit investigation

15:15.407 --> 15:18.951
even though everyone knows
exactly who did it, but...

15:19.952 --> 15:22.121
You know, maybe you should
ask for your transfer back.

15:22.205 --> 15:23.873
Just get the fuck out of here.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.833
It's better than the alternative.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.962
I can't lose any more people, Nicky.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.884
Alex is coming to visit me.

15:35.718 --> 15:36.803
Jesus, Chapman.

15:38.012 --> 15:40.473
You need to figure out
what the fuck you want.

15:41.808 --> 15:42.809
I know.

15:42.892 --> 15:47.689
You know, 'cause if it really
is to stay here in this shithole

15:47.772 --> 15:50.817
so you can get occasional visits
from your demented girlfriend,

15:50.900 --> 15:53.403
I mean, then, man, it sounds
like you're living the dream.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.780
But if you want my advice,

15:55.863 --> 15:58.616
then get out of your own goddamn
drama for a minute, you know?

15:58.700 --> 16:01.661
And, maybe, spend some
of that energy praying

16:01.744 --> 16:05.540
that your roommate makes it out of
medical with all her brain cells intact.

16:07.083 --> 16:10.044
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't
mean to make this about me.

16:10.127 --> 16:12.755
No, don't worry. I get it.
It's not the same for you.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.799
I care about Red, too.

16:14.882 --> 16:16.301
Uh-huh.

16:16.384 --> 16:20.054
Okay, but she's not your mom.
It's different when you're family.

16:27.979 --> 16:30.982
Mama, please. This shit is salty
enough without your tears in it.

16:31.065 --> 16:33.192
You wanna take a break? Ven.

16:33.276 --> 16:35.987
What's looking good today,
Bennett? I'm a hungry man.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.030
There's some baked chicken
but it looks a little gray.

16:38.114 --> 16:39.699
I tend to stick with the PB and J.

16:43.077 --> 16:44.787
What's going on over there?

16:44.871 --> 16:48.500
Oh, well, you know, Ruiz is on
the transfer list that Fig put out.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.544
It's really sad. She's got the
baby and everything. It's...

16:53.170 --> 16:54.797
I'm canceling all the transfers.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.966
Really? How?

16:58.676 --> 16:59.719
Can you keep a secret?

17:01.471 --> 17:02.597
Yeah, absolutely.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.808
Yeah, you seem like it.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.560
Okay, listen.

17:07.644 --> 17:09.436
Some stuff has gone down,

17:09.521 --> 17:15.777
and it looks like my star might
be rising while Fig's explodes.

17:17.194 --> 17:18.488
You know what I'm saying?

17:19.614 --> 17:20.615
Not really.

17:20.698 --> 17:21.741
She's out.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.369
I'm in.

17:25.453 --> 17:26.454
Well, in-ish.

17:26.538 --> 17:29.707
I gotta show the warden I'm
his guy. He's testing me out.

17:29.791 --> 17:31.250
Wow.

17:31.334 --> 17:33.961
Yeah, this has gotta go well, Bennett.

17:34.045 --> 17:36.172
The next few days are crucial.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.550
We gotta make sure.

17:39.676 --> 17:41.761
I wanna do things right.

17:41.844 --> 17:44.556
Bring guys like you up along with me.

17:44.639 --> 17:46.433
The good guys.

17:46.516 --> 17:49.811
The guys who keep their eyes
open and their noses clean.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.897
Sounds... that sounds great, sir.

17:54.732 --> 17:58.320
So, listen... why don't you
go give Ruiz the good news?

17:58.403 --> 18:00.863
Tell her she's not going anywhere.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.239
- Me?
- Yeah.

18:03.825 --> 18:05.743
Be the hero. Go ahead.

18:08.705 --> 18:11.833
Thank you. Um, thanks a lot.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.585
Go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead, kid.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.214
What's going on?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.969
I'm canceling Ruiz's transfer.

18:23.052 --> 18:25.054
She's staying put.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.180
So nice of you.

18:26.263 --> 18:28.307
I do what I can.

18:30.101 --> 18:32.144
Oh, my God!

18:32.228 --> 18:34.021
Hey, should you be
carrying such a heavy tray?

18:34.897 --> 18:36.358
That's fine, thanks.

18:39.694 --> 18:41.070
It's better!

19:05.011 --> 19:06.429
- Listen, T...
- Stop.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.055
Can we please not have a whole talk

19:08.139 --> 19:11.225
about our feelings and what
happened and, like, status

19:11.308 --> 19:13.436
because I never learned that and...

19:13.520 --> 19:17.899
and it really makes me, like,
wanna jump out of my skin so...

19:17.982 --> 19:21.193
can we just sit here and be cool now?

19:26.115 --> 19:27.241
Well, maybe just a little talk?

19:28.325 --> 19:31.663
I mean... Look, what if Amanda
talked about it... right?

19:31.746 --> 19:34.081
Like, her fucked-up
relationship with Mumsy

19:34.165 --> 19:36.125
and how hard that made
things with Mackenzie

19:36.208 --> 19:38.127
when they took that
cruise to Spain and shit.

19:39.253 --> 19:40.337
Could you do it like that?

19:40.422 --> 19:42.799
I'll work on it, okay?

19:44.967 --> 19:46.177
I swear.

19:48.805 --> 19:53.017
I have an appointment to meet
with my guru to get a mantra soon

19:53.100 --> 19:54.561
so I'll start right after that.

19:54.644 --> 19:57.855
But before I get my lips
injected with ass fat

19:57.939 --> 20:00.066
so that we can really talk.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.402
"Ass fat."

20:03.486 --> 20:06.989
Here... because you look like a monkey.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.076
Oh, damn, here I am
with no peanuts for you.

20:10.159 --> 20:12.579
- I'll just take your Jell-O for gelatin!
- No!

20:12.662 --> 20:14.872
Like hell you will! Shit.

20:14.956 --> 20:16.708
You know red my favorite flavor!

20:16.791 --> 20:19.335
Yeah.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.505
You're an animal.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.174
And your little electroslock therapy?

20:25.257 --> 20:26.718
You're not fooling anyone.

20:28.219 --> 20:32.056
Please tell my old friend, Red,
that I... I hope she feels better.

20:32.139 --> 20:33.933
Some flipping friend you are.

20:35.392 --> 20:36.686
What's the matter with you people?

20:36.769 --> 20:40.523
"You people"? You mean black people?

20:40.607 --> 20:43.526
I mean, blind people. All right?

20:43.610 --> 20:46.488
Blindly following a fucking psychopath!

20:46.571 --> 20:49.115
All right, little ones.

20:49.198 --> 20:52.201
Now, if you're done with your
accusations and your name-calling,

20:52.284 --> 20:55.454
we'd all like to finish our meal in peace.

20:56.581 --> 21:00.126
May you never have a minute of peace.

21:04.839 --> 21:08.467
I trust with you two around, I won't.

21:08.551 --> 21:09.677
Oh, yeah.

21:09.761 --> 21:11.345
We'll be around.

21:19.395 --> 21:21.147
A-ha.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.650
Shut the fuck up.

21:24.817 --> 21:28.946
Aw, you bitches friends again? Oh, now...

21:30.573 --> 21:33.951
ain't that some Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants shit?

21:34.744 --> 21:36.328
I mean, ya'll know she done it.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.917
You don't think she won't
go after your ass one day?

21:41.000 --> 21:45.296
You make her mad... look
at her wrong... whatever?

21:46.172 --> 21:48.966
Look, business is good, and
I ain't rocking the boat.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.761
Can't we all just get along?

21:52.845 --> 21:55.222
No... not when she's around.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.601
Don't feel bad if you don't see it yet.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.603
Took me damn near 15 years.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.272
I just hope you all wise
up before it's too late.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.003
It's up to you.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.672
You could go full-on
Britney Spears meltdown.

23:09.756 --> 23:13.217
Oh, no. Cancer chic is anything but.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.553
Now, I'm thinking a nice Emma
Watson pixie'll be cute, though.

23:16.638 --> 23:17.972
Mmm.

23:18.055 --> 23:21.726
I appreciate your guys' choices,
but I'm thinking, like, right here.

23:21.809 --> 23:24.020
Oh, you mean like Victoria Beckham?

23:24.103 --> 23:27.398
Sorry, shortcake, above the
ears or it doesn't count.

23:27.481 --> 23:31.235
Hey, you wanna run with the big boys,
you gotta prove you're one of us, hmm?

23:31.318 --> 23:33.154
I thought this was about the girls.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.197
It's confusing, I know.

23:37.992 --> 23:38.993
Hey.

23:39.076 --> 23:41.245
I'm canceling Safe Place.

23:41.328 --> 23:42.664
I thought you should know.

23:42.747 --> 23:44.498
Why?

23:44.581 --> 23:45.582
Wait!

23:45.667 --> 23:47.626
Mr. Healy, wait!

23:47.710 --> 23:51.255
Aw, is your boyfriend hurt?

23:51.338 --> 23:53.090
Don't do that.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.551
Come in!

23:56.552 --> 23:57.553
Hey, boss.

23:58.763 --> 24:01.933
Hello, O'Neill. How are
you on this fine day?

24:02.016 --> 24:03.935
Oh, I'm good, thanks.

24:05.352 --> 24:07.563
I bought a banjolele on Craigslist.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.398
I don't know what that is.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.234
It's like a four-stringed
banjo, but little.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.237
It's... you know, it's a
ukulele version of a banjo.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.322
Ah!

24:16.989 --> 24:18.741
Asked and answered.

24:18.825 --> 24:22.328
So, aside from the news of
your adorable online purchase,

24:22.411 --> 24:24.121
is there another reason for your visit?

24:24.205 --> 24:26.248
Oh, yeah, um...

24:26.332 --> 24:27.750
What do you wanna do about the nuns?

24:27.834 --> 24:29.668
- Nuns?
- Yeah, there's a gaggle of 'em.

24:29.752 --> 24:31.128
- Gaggle?
- Uh, like a...

24:31.212 --> 24:33.672
like a murder of crows,
there's a gaggle of nuns.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.010
We're here to support Jane
Ingalls' hunger strike.

24:38.094 --> 24:39.428
Oh, Jesus.

24:39.511 --> 24:40.637
Watch your mouth.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.432
I can't have this today.

24:44.225 --> 24:47.269
Not now. I... Your timing
could not have been worse.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.313
So sorry to inconvenience you.

24:49.396 --> 24:54.777
Look, Sister... I'm the good guy.
I... I want things to be good.

24:57.238 --> 24:58.906
Could you come back in three to five days?

24:58.990 --> 25:00.116
No, I could not.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.076
I had to ask.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.621
Babysit the nuns.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.707
Sir, I don't think that's a good
idea. I got a history with nuns.

25:08.791 --> 25:11.710
Suck it up.

25:11.794 --> 25:14.588
I need things calm and contained. No drama.

25:14.671 --> 25:17.216
And if the press comes, you call me.

25:23.389 --> 25:25.474
But it wasn't me.

25:25.557 --> 25:26.558
That's very good.

25:26.642 --> 25:29.812
That is exactly what you say when
you go in there to talk to SIS.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.147
It's perfect, Suzanne.

25:31.230 --> 25:35.192
No, Vee... it really
wasn't me. I didn't do it!

25:35.276 --> 25:38.988
Child, when you commit, you
really do commit, don't you?

25:39.071 --> 25:40.406
I admire that.

25:42.074 --> 25:46.578
Between us... I just wanna
say thank you, little girl.

25:46.662 --> 25:50.666
What you did was rough...
but it had to be done.

25:50.749 --> 25:52.334
Vee...

25:52.418 --> 25:54.586
We shouldn't talk about us anymore.

25:54.670 --> 25:58.632
I got you something
special from the commissary.

26:00.051 --> 26:01.052
We can play later.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.429
You and me.

26:20.696 --> 26:22.073
All right, it's like this.

26:22.156 --> 26:24.116
Stop... don't talk to me.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.203
Loser, lame-boy, wannabe. Oh!

26:27.286 --> 26:32.041
Like, totally, all you
wanna be is me. Stay fresh.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.167
Okay, now you try.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.086
Okay, so it's like...

26:35.169 --> 26:39.215
Stop, don't talk to me.
Loser, lame-ass, wannabe.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.842
Boy. It's "lame-boy."

26:40.925 --> 26:41.926
Yeah, but we're talkin' Pennsatucky.

26:42.009 --> 26:44.386
So shouldn't it be, like,
"lame-ass" or "lame-girl"?

26:46.472 --> 26:48.724
Y'all are sad fucking assholes.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.684
You know, this is really bullying.

26:50.767 --> 26:54.063
While you have every right to your
negative feelings towards Pennsatucky,

26:54.146 --> 26:57.233
you're being cruel... and I think
you're both better than that.

27:00.277 --> 27:01.570
Embrace the light.

27:01.653 --> 27:05.699
You know, I can take care of
myself, Ching Chong China doll!

27:07.243 --> 27:10.371
She's Japanese-Scottish,
you ignorant dumb-ass.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.873
Ignorant dumb-ass dyke.

27:11.956 --> 27:13.832
Whoa.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.168
Excuse me?

27:16.252 --> 27:19.421
Like we haven't seen you hanging
out with fatty-fatty man-girl.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.007
Oh, yeah? So what?

27:21.090 --> 27:22.799
What is with all this name calling?

27:22.884 --> 27:27.804
We're expressing our feelings...
in lieu of physical violence.

27:27.889 --> 27:29.431
Something Mr. Healy taught me.

27:29.515 --> 27:30.807
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

27:30.892 --> 27:32.977
Then where were you before?

27:33.060 --> 27:35.021
No one came to his Safe
Place thing, you know.

27:36.063 --> 27:38.815
He was all sad and mad.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.110
And I got his weird
Russian cookies. Up top!

27:41.193 --> 27:43.695
Everyone in this place is sad and mad.

27:44.655 --> 27:47.658
I mean, I get it. We're
in prison. It sucks.

27:47.741 --> 27:52.997
But we should be leaning on each other...
finding support in our fellow criminals...

27:53.080 --> 27:54.540
so we're not isolated.

27:54.623 --> 27:56.167
I need a friend.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.961
Don't look at me.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.462
I got a friend.

28:03.174 --> 28:04.466
Hey.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.093
Nobody showed up at Safe Place?

28:06.177 --> 28:09.221
Nope, not a one.

28:09.305 --> 28:12.641
And no more Safe Place.
It's probably all your fault.

28:12.724 --> 28:15.061
Okay, this is totally weird.

28:15.144 --> 28:17.313
I'm in the wrong outfit.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.190
I like your sweater.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.113
It's soft.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.326
Like your resolve when
you're offered a plea deal.

28:31.702 --> 28:35.164
It came down at the
very last minute, Piper.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.584
And they promised me it
would put him away for good.

28:38.667 --> 28:41.337
But it made me a perjurer
and you a free woman.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.629
I thought you were gonna tell the truth!

28:42.713 --> 28:44.256
And I thought you were gonna lie!

28:44.340 --> 28:46.592
Jesus, we are like a
fucking O. Henry story.

28:53.932 --> 28:55.351
It's good to see your face.

28:56.768 --> 28:59.146
I don't know what to say.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.107
You have every right to be angry.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.443
I don't know if I'm angry.

29:05.069 --> 29:07.571
I'm confused... by you.

29:08.739 --> 29:10.407
I'm confused by me, too.

29:11.492 --> 29:13.869
I'm pretty much the master of
handling things completely wrong.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.954
Yeah, well, that's an understatement.

29:17.789 --> 29:18.957
I'm a fuck-up.

29:20.084 --> 29:23.379
And now I get to be a fuck-up in
a shithole apartment in Queens.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.506
Too afraid to even open my curtains.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.012
I'm really fucking lonely, Piper.

29:31.095 --> 29:33.805
Well, I'm sure you'll find
somebody to keep your bed warm.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.062
I sleep with a gun.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.981
You what? Alex, what the
hell? You're on probation.

29:43.065 --> 29:45.901
There is a car parked outside
of my apartment every day.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.486
He's trying to scare me.

29:49.155 --> 29:53.284
I wanna go out there with a baseball
bat and smash the fucking windshield in.

29:55.286 --> 29:57.163
Honestly, I should just
start dealing again.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.917
Find a bigger, tougher new kingpin
who can beat up my old kingpin.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.170
- That's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

30:05.129 --> 30:06.672
What am I qualified to do?

30:07.798 --> 30:11.343
I have... I have no job. I'm
afraid to leave my apartment.

30:11.427 --> 30:13.137
I got so used to sleeping
with the lights on

30:13.220 --> 30:15.389
that I'm totally freaked out by the dark.

30:15.472 --> 30:19.643
My probation officer is a joke.
His name is David Crockett.

30:20.811 --> 30:23.272
Davy fucking Crockett
is my probation officer.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.566
The King of the Wild Frontier?

30:25.649 --> 30:30.446
King of sitting on his fat fucking
ass, stuffing his face with Swiss rolls,

30:30.529 --> 30:34.075
hoping to bust me for
some stupid infraction.

30:36.993 --> 30:40.372
You'd think that part of his job would
be protecting his probies, you know?

30:42.124 --> 30:44.376
Nobody gives a shit about ex-cons.

30:46.337 --> 30:47.629
What are you gonna do?

30:55.387 --> 30:57.306
- I'm skipping town.
- You can't.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.767
I don't have a choice. These
people know where I live.

31:01.893 --> 31:03.104
That's why I wanted to see you.

31:03.187 --> 31:06.357
When I go, Piper, I can't come back.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.275
I have to just disappear.

31:13.322 --> 31:14.448
You can't leave me.

31:14.531 --> 31:16.325
Piper, I'm in danger.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.037
But I don't have anyone left.

31:27.043 --> 31:28.254
I'm sorry, Piper.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.550
I'm sorry for all of it.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.929
I know that my track record is shit...

31:39.681 --> 31:41.392
but I really do love you.

31:41.475 --> 31:42.851
Yeah, well, I hate you.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.436
No, you don't.

31:50.776 --> 31:51.777
No.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.197
No, I don't.

32:12.881 --> 32:13.882
Hey, junkie.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.385
Hey, you traitorous piece of shit.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.221
It's time to start scrubbing
that dirty little soul of yours.

32:20.681 --> 32:25.727
Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
I'm slowly killing myself with corn syrup.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.605
Boo, you sold her out.

32:28.689 --> 32:31.107
You're part of why she's
lying in that hospital bed.

32:34.403 --> 32:35.612
All right, look.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.491
You need to make it right.

32:39.575 --> 32:41.452
What do you want me to do about it?

32:41.535 --> 32:43.787
Smother Parker in her sleep
with my left ass cheek?

32:45.789 --> 32:48.041
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

32:48.124 --> 32:49.125
Aw, come on.

32:49.210 --> 32:52.588
You, of all people, know there's
a million ways to hurt someone.

32:54.298 --> 32:58.427
So tell your old pal, Nicky,
where she stashes her shit.

33:00.471 --> 33:02.180
Find that last shred of loyalty.

33:05.058 --> 33:06.184
Where are you?

33:06.268 --> 33:07.644
- Where are you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:07.728 --> 33:09.438
What... What's going on, yo?

33:09.521 --> 33:14.109
I can't find it! I know it was here.
Now it's not here. I know it was here!

33:14.192 --> 33:18.947
Twenty-two left, 14 right,
9 left. I know it was here!

33:19.030 --> 33:20.241
- Your lock?
- Shh!

33:22.451 --> 33:23.910
Lady Locksley.

33:26.330 --> 33:30.041
Oh, shit. I think she
might've done something bad.

33:30.125 --> 33:31.627
What are you talking about?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.379
I think I did it.

33:34.546 --> 33:38.425
I think I attacked that Russian
lady, and hit and hit and hit her!

33:38.509 --> 33:39.926
Yo, you think?

33:40.010 --> 33:42.220
Suzanne, if you done it,
don't you think you would know?

33:42.304 --> 33:45.015
No, I don't always know what I'm doing.

33:45.098 --> 33:49.478
You know, sometimes I block
stuff out, some bad stuff like...

33:49.561 --> 33:52.481
like that time I did
the thing to my neighbor.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.650
It don't sound like you blocked that out.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.653
Well... no.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.989
That one's still pretty
vivid. But Vee says I did it.

34:01.072 --> 34:04.993
Yo, Suzanne... Vee is a liar.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.788
No. No, no, no.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.456
No, no, no.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.751
She is a truth teller. She told me that.

34:13.835 --> 34:17.714
She says... we're straight up.

34:17.797 --> 34:22.636
Built on a foundation
of honesty and loyalty.

34:22.719 --> 34:25.681
Yo, built on a foundation
of bullshit, more like.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.724
You think that woman loyal to you?

34:27.808 --> 34:31.353
She is playing you, and
this game is for serious.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.271
You take the blame on
this, you going to max.

34:33.355 --> 34:36.024
You getting rapped with attempted murder.

34:36.107 --> 34:39.152
Yo, why would you take the blame
when you ain't done nothing?

34:39.235 --> 34:42.364
That woman is evil and she's trying
to frame you and do you harm...

34:42.447 --> 34:45.742
No, don't you dare speak ill of her!

34:52.583 --> 34:56.962
You know, she told me you'd say bad things.

34:57.045 --> 35:00.716
Yeah, she warned me, and now
here you are doing just that.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.884
- Suzanne.
- So...

35:02.968 --> 35:06.137
I think you'd better go.

35:11.226 --> 35:12.728
You poor, crazy fool.

35:12.811 --> 35:13.812
No.

35:15.397 --> 35:17.023
I am not crazy.

35:18.316 --> 35:19.818
I am unique.

35:21.152 --> 35:22.904
There used to be this show on TV

35:22.988 --> 35:27.117
about girls who, like, had
no idea they were pregnant.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.537
And I always thought,
"Yeah, I could see that.

35:30.621 --> 35:34.207
"You're kind of chunky. You
don't feel so hot, anyway."

35:35.667 --> 35:37.711
But now I'm calling bullshit on it.

35:38.670 --> 35:42.132
I mean, I'm... I'm not all
that popping out or anything.

35:42.215 --> 35:45.761
Aleida says the women in
our family carry in our ass,

35:45.844 --> 35:48.138
but... I feel her.

35:48.221 --> 35:50.015
I really feel her in there.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.937
Daya, I, uh...

35:56.021 --> 35:57.188
I can't tell anyone.

35:58.857 --> 35:59.858
Oh.

35:59.941 --> 36:02.193
No, look. Listen to me.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.280
Something happened with Fig.

36:05.363 --> 36:07.699
Embezzling or something.

36:08.825 --> 36:09.951
Caputo's getting promoted.

36:10.035 --> 36:14.164
He says that I'm looking
at a promotion, too.

36:14.247 --> 36:18.001
It'll be crazy to come clean right
now. This means more money for us.

36:18.084 --> 36:19.961
This means you can't be the dad.

36:20.045 --> 36:23.131
Come on, baby. Look,
hey, we'll figure it out.

36:28.178 --> 36:32.098
Don't say anything about the Fig
thing, okay? It's still on the down-low.

36:32.182 --> 36:33.850
Well, you were looking for an excuse.

36:34.976 --> 36:37.438
I guess this raise/promotion
thing is as good as any.

36:37.521 --> 36:40.148
I'm not looking for an excuse.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.236
I love you, John...

36:45.320 --> 36:46.404
but you're a pussy.

36:47.698 --> 36:49.575
I gotta get back to work.

36:49.658 --> 36:50.659
Daya...

36:50.742 --> 36:52.327
Daya, I'm a man on the rise.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.079
I'm not a...

36:54.162 --> 36:56.623
Seriously, don't say anything
about the Fig thing, okay?

36:56.707 --> 36:58.792
It was told to me in confidence.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.085
Please?

37:03.254 --> 37:04.673
So Fig's out?

37:04.756 --> 37:07.342
I knew that skinny puta
was pulling some shit.

37:10.428 --> 37:11.972
She never smile with her teeth.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.432
Can't trust a bitch don't
smile with her teeth.

37:14.516 --> 37:16.935
She has some nice shoes though, man.

37:17.018 --> 37:19.020
Yo, you seen the footwear on that one?

37:19.104 --> 37:21.523
If she was stealing, you know
exactly where that money was going.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.859
If I was stealing big,

37:23.942 --> 37:27.362
I would buy me something that
won't wear out from walking around.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.781
Like a diamond for my
belly button. No, for real.

37:29.865 --> 37:30.866
- That's nice.
- Yeah, right?

37:30.949 --> 37:33.118
That's enough. It looks good.

37:39.457 --> 37:43.128
Well... would you look at
Norma Appleseed over here.

37:43.211 --> 37:45.171
What are you planting, an orchard?

37:45.255 --> 37:49.843
No, I know what you're up to. What
were you gonna use to grind them?

37:54.598 --> 37:55.807
Wow.

37:55.891 --> 37:59.520
Look at you... quiet fire.

37:59.603 --> 38:00.979
Well, you know how many
seeds you're gonna need

38:01.062 --> 38:02.981
to make a lethal dose of arsenic?

38:03.732 --> 38:07.402
More than all the apples ever given
to any teacher you've ever known.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.571
And then you're gonna need a
blender, you're gonna need lye,

38:09.655 --> 38:11.156
and you're gonna need
an airtight container.

38:11.239 --> 38:13.408
And then you gotta get it
down Vee's fucking throat.

38:14.701 --> 38:17.913
Ay, Mama, you didn't
think this one through.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.833
Yeah... I know a few things.

38:23.293 --> 38:25.295
I know she hurt your girl.

38:25.378 --> 38:28.173
And I know she gotta go, but...

38:28.256 --> 38:29.591
there are other ways.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.220
All you gotta do is ask.

38:37.140 --> 38:40.686
Okay, tonight, I want
you to go home and look up

38:40.769 --> 38:43.313
"leopard cub kills baboon
and tries to adopt its baby."

38:43.396 --> 38:47.776
Then you come back tomorrow and you
tell me babies are born with sin.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.445
Why don't you give us the highlights?

38:50.528 --> 38:51.572
Okay, fine.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.283
A leopard cub kills a baboon, right?

38:55.366 --> 38:59.287
And then as the leopard's dragging the
bloody baboon corpse home for dinner,

38:59.370 --> 39:02.123
a baby baboon falls from
the folds of its dead mother.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.751
And you're thinking, "Leopard's
gonna eat the baby," right?

39:04.835 --> 39:07.378
A little baby baboon appetizer
before the main course?

39:07.462 --> 39:10.506
But, no, he shelters the baby.

39:10.591 --> 39:12.801
He even defends it against a hyena.

39:12.884 --> 39:16.221
And why? Why would this
wild animal do that?

39:16.304 --> 39:22.143
Because even a feral,
wild, predatory beast...

39:22.227 --> 39:26.857
can recognize innocence when it sees
it and feels the need to protect it.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.484
Yet Catholics can't.

39:30.485 --> 39:32.112
Hey, what is your problem?

39:32.195 --> 39:33.947
What's my problem?

39:34.030 --> 39:36.742
Catholic school... that's my problem.

39:36.825 --> 39:40.161
You people seem all "la, la, la, God,"

39:40.245 --> 39:44.124
but in reality, you are
professional humiliators!

39:44.207 --> 39:46.627
Oh, did someone get rapped with a ruler?

39:46.710 --> 39:48.003
Get over it. You're a grown up.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.087
Let it go.

39:49.170 --> 39:51.464
But what happened to the baby baboon?

39:51.547 --> 39:52.883
It died of exposure.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.927
I suppose it was God's will.

39:56.011 --> 39:57.679
Nonsense.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.014
It was just really cold.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.390
Like a nun's heart.

40:03.894 --> 40:05.353
Oh, fuck.

40:05.436 --> 40:07.355
Nuns say, "fuck"?

40:07.438 --> 40:09.024
I'm a former nun.

40:10.316 --> 40:11.526
They all came.

40:11.609 --> 40:14.029
Who knew I still had juice?

40:14.112 --> 40:16.489
Aren't you pleased? Your
friends showed up for you.

40:16.572 --> 40:20.827
I need to think about something else. I
keep... having fantasies about biscuits.

40:20.911 --> 40:22.037
You made your bed.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.999
Now you can lie in it, strapped to an IV.

40:26.082 --> 40:29.377
Or is it two IVs? I'm seeing double.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.922
Looks like there's two of you in that bed.

40:32.005 --> 40:34.090
I wish.

40:34.174 --> 40:35.300
You do?

40:38.594 --> 40:42.974
I always wondered about that whole
celibacy thing with you people.

40:43.058 --> 40:44.350
How does that work?

40:44.434 --> 40:46.061
Well, if you read the papers,

40:46.144 --> 40:48.396
you know better in some
cases than in others.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.899
What about with you?

40:50.982 --> 40:51.983
Did you ever...

40:52.067 --> 40:53.568
I've masturbated.

40:53.651 --> 40:57.405
There's this statue of Jesus on the
cross that was especially ripped.

40:58.907 --> 41:00.241
He was my guy.

41:01.659 --> 41:05.706
Before Dmitri, there
was this man named Pavel.

41:05.789 --> 41:10.043
Even talking about him
now... there's a tightening.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.087
So what happened?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.630
America... home of the free.

41:15.506 --> 41:18.927
Dmitri was tame in bed, bold in life.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.096
Pavel, the opposite.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.263
I went with life.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.934
I went with the man who
was going to go to America.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.438
So, you didn't like having
sex with your husband?

41:30.521 --> 41:32.398
I wouldn't say that, no.

41:33.358 --> 41:34.525
I like sex.

41:35.401 --> 41:38.696
I never rolled away after and thought,
"Oh, I wish I hadn't done that."

41:38.780 --> 41:40.866
No, it was always nice.

41:41.742 --> 41:43.284
But there's a part of me...

41:44.494 --> 41:48.498
a part of every woman, I
think, that doesn't want nice.

41:48.581 --> 41:51.752
That's the problem with
married sex in general.

41:51.835 --> 41:53.461
No more fear.

41:53.544 --> 41:54.880
Fear is good?

41:56.631 --> 41:58.466
Fear is very good.

41:58.549 --> 41:59.592
Oh!

42:00.301 --> 42:03.388
But I'll say this for my
hairy-backed husband...

42:03.471 --> 42:05.556
he always took care of me.

42:06.516 --> 42:08.977
Turned him on.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.521
Could spend weeks down there.

42:12.898 --> 42:15.859
I do enjoy the release.

42:15.942 --> 42:17.235
It cracks my neck.

42:19.988 --> 42:21.823
Oh!

42:21.907 --> 42:23.158
No, thank you.

42:23.241 --> 42:26.744
Oh, come on. Stop it with this nonsense.

42:26.828 --> 42:29.664
Believe me, all I want
is to eat that sandwich,

42:29.747 --> 42:32.625
but I can't break my strike
with 100 nuns out there.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.419
Please take it away!

42:39.090 --> 42:42.302
You still worry about
what your friends think?

42:42.385 --> 42:44.429
You think I'm acting childish?

42:45.388 --> 42:48.266
Who's the one plotting revenge
in her bed like a gangbanger?

42:50.101 --> 42:51.102
Here.

42:52.187 --> 42:56.316
We can sandwich toast to
orgasms and do our time in peace.

42:57.608 --> 43:00.028
Are you going to talk to SIS about Parker?

43:00.111 --> 43:03.698
I can't sandwich toast
to climaxes and peace

43:03.781 --> 43:05.033
while you plot a war.

43:05.909 --> 43:07.535
And what happens in the meantime?

43:07.618 --> 43:08.703
By remaining silent,

43:08.786 --> 43:12.457
you let this... clearly
dangerous woman stay here.

43:12.540 --> 43:15.210
How long before she hurts someone else?

43:15.293 --> 43:16.711
One of your girls?

43:16.794 --> 43:17.795
Oh.

43:18.796 --> 43:24.010
You eat and I sing like a canary, huh?

43:26.637 --> 43:29.807
We abandon our principles together.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.521
You found her out by the greenhouse?

43:37.190 --> 43:39.150
What was she doing out there?

43:40.318 --> 43:45.531
I do not remember taking
Lady Locksley out there.

43:45.615 --> 43:47.492
I do not!

43:52.163 --> 43:55.750
Now, it is quite possible that
she has been interfered with.

43:55.833 --> 43:58.920
Can you tell us where you were at
the time the incident took place?

43:59.004 --> 44:01.965
I don't know. When did
the incident take place?

44:02.048 --> 44:04.885
We're not sure. We have a window.

44:04.968 --> 44:07.803
How did your lock end up in
the yard by the greenhouse?

44:07.888 --> 44:10.056
We're not sure. We have a window.

44:10.140 --> 44:12.017
- Who's we?
- Who?

44:13.018 --> 44:16.854
Miss Warren, you've spent your
fair share of time in Psych.

44:17.730 --> 44:19.732
You have a history of violent outbursts.

44:19.815 --> 44:23.653
The incident with inmate Waterstone
in which you broke her collarbone.

44:23.736 --> 44:26.990
The circumstances behind the
"accident" in the woodshop.

44:27.073 --> 44:28.533
Several assaults.

44:28.616 --> 44:31.077
An episode in which you removed
all of your clothes and...

44:31.161 --> 44:32.954
Uh, uh, my therapist says,

44:33.038 --> 44:36.707
"Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery."

44:38.168 --> 44:41.462
We understand there was some bad blood
between Miss Parker and Mrs. Reznikov.

44:41.546 --> 44:43.256
We further understand that

44:43.339 --> 44:45.633
you and Miss Parker have
a close relationship?

44:45.716 --> 44:49.345
Yeah, Vee and I are close. That's right.

44:49.429 --> 44:51.639
Do you think she slocked Mrs. Reznikov?

44:51.722 --> 44:55.601
No. No, no. Vee doesn't do that.

44:55.685 --> 44:58.896
She's the brains, I'm the muscle.

45:00.065 --> 45:01.482
You're the muscle?

45:01.566 --> 45:03.609
You happen to flex in the greenhouse?

45:03.693 --> 45:04.902
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

45:04.986 --> 45:06.612
So we've gone from "no" to "maybe"?

45:06.696 --> 45:07.697
No.

45:07.780 --> 45:08.781
No?

45:09.490 --> 45:10.491
Yes.

45:10.575 --> 45:12.202
Yes?

45:12.285 --> 45:15.330
Look... I'm feeling confused.

45:15.413 --> 45:17.415
Is there something you'd like to tell us?

45:17.498 --> 45:18.874
No.

45:18.959 --> 45:22.587
Yes. No. Yes. No. No!

45:22.670 --> 45:24.755
Yes! No! Yes! No.

45:24.839 --> 45:27.717
Wait, no, yes, no, yes, no, no, yes, no.

45:27.800 --> 45:32.305
No, no, no. Yes. No. No. No, no,
no. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no...

45:34.349 --> 45:35.725
You know, when I was a kid,

45:35.808 --> 45:38.603
I used to think that there
were people in the radio.

45:38.686 --> 45:41.314
Like, these little itty-bitty
people that climbed in

45:41.397 --> 45:45.693
and played on their mini instruments
and sang into their tiny microphones!

45:47.153 --> 45:49.322
That's stupid.

45:49.405 --> 45:52.867
I used to put Scotch Tape around my dolls

45:52.950 --> 45:55.036
so I'd know if they
moved when I was sleeping.

45:57.663 --> 45:59.915
They never did.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.336
But I always wondered
if they were smart enough

46:03.419 --> 46:08.924
to go back to their exact
positions and put the tape back on

46:09.009 --> 46:11.052
so I wouldn't know.

46:11.136 --> 46:12.887
Hey, did you ever see that movie,

46:12.970 --> 46:16.682
the one where there's the cowboy and
he's, like, the king of the castle

46:16.766 --> 46:21.562
and then this astronaut shows
up and he tries to take over

46:21.646 --> 46:23.856
and so the cowboy attempts to murder him,

46:23.939 --> 46:25.941
but instead

46:26.026 --> 46:30.696
the astronaut is taken hostage
by, like, this evil psychopath

46:30.780 --> 46:33.199
and the cowboy has to rescue him

46:33.283 --> 46:35.826
and then they end up
becoming really good friends?

46:36.494 --> 46:37.495
Toy Story?

46:37.578 --> 46:40.081
Oh, my God! Toy Story!
That's it, that's it.

46:40.165 --> 46:42.750
I love that movie. Oh!

46:45.503 --> 46:48.756
You got one fucked-up
perspective on the world, kid.

46:48.839 --> 46:50.800
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

46:51.717 --> 46:54.845
I guess that's why I gotta be locked up.

46:54.929 --> 46:55.971
No...

46:57.682 --> 46:59.767
that's what makes you great.

47:03.729 --> 47:05.273
Thanks, Rosa.

48:14.259 --> 48:16.427
Hey, you ever think about
Jay-Z and Beyoncé fucking?

48:16.511 --> 48:19.389
'Cause I do. Like, more
than I do myself, even.

48:19.472 --> 48:21.849
You don't think that's weird?

48:21.932 --> 48:22.933
Who's been in here?

48:23.017 --> 48:26.521
Yo... in case math ain't your jam,

48:26.604 --> 48:28.939
you know I got, like,
50 pounds on you, easy!

48:36.447 --> 48:38.658
Who the fuck has been in here?

48:38.741 --> 48:39.909
I don't know, man.

48:39.992 --> 48:42.328
I don't know.

48:46.874 --> 48:48.834
Damn. Fuck.

You look rough, Red.

49:40.303 --> 49:41.512
Yeah, well...

49:42.472 --> 49:45.641
repeated shots to the
head with a lock in a sock

49:45.725 --> 49:47.227
will do that to a person.

49:48.436 --> 49:50.730
Thank you for coming to see me.

49:50.813 --> 49:52.357
But you asked.

49:54.191 --> 49:55.360
So...

49:56.277 --> 49:59.572
SIS... thinks they got it figured out.

50:00.615 --> 50:03.284
They're pinning everything on Crazy Eye...

50:03.368 --> 50:04.577
On Warren.

50:04.660 --> 50:07.455
They got some kind of
half confession out of her,

50:07.538 --> 50:09.039
and that's good enough for them.

50:10.625 --> 50:11.792
They wanna go home.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.878
Red has something she wants to tell you.

50:13.961 --> 50:17.798
I can speak for myself.
Thank you, hungry nun.

50:25.014 --> 50:26.807
So...

50:26.891 --> 50:28.058
Healy...

50:30.436 --> 50:33.564
you have to bring SIS back in here.

50:34.482 --> 50:36.484
You've already made your statement.

50:36.567 --> 50:39.820
Like I said, SIS thinks
they have their gal.

50:41.113 --> 50:43.283
You know she didn't do it.

50:44.284 --> 50:47.036
I'm trying to do the
right thing here, Healy.

50:48.078 --> 50:49.289
Help me.

50:49.372 --> 50:51.499
I... I don't know anything.

50:53.293 --> 50:57.463
You'd let the crazy one take
the hit for the real evil?

50:57.547 --> 50:59.757
Where's your fight, Healy?

50:59.840 --> 51:01.676
You used to care.

51:04.554 --> 51:07.557
Where was your conscience when
they were in here the first time?

51:07.640 --> 51:10.351
It was buried under her
mistrust for the system...

51:11.143 --> 51:13.020
but she's trying to do right.

51:16.231 --> 51:19.569
Yeah... well, you know what you
get when you try around here?

51:20.486 --> 51:21.862
Not much.

51:24.949 --> 51:27.034
Have a nice day.

51:27.117 --> 51:29.036
You take care of yourself, okay?

51:41.298 --> 51:42.675
Miss Cisneros.

51:42.758 --> 51:43.801
Hello.

51:47.805 --> 51:50.891
There's a chair outside in the
hallway if you'd like to wait there.

51:50.975 --> 51:52.852
I gotta stay. It's policy.

51:52.935 --> 51:54.687
I understand, of course...

51:54.770 --> 51:57.815
but I would appreciate a few
moments alone with my patient.

51:57.898 --> 51:59.066
I'm just doing my job.

51:59.149 --> 52:00.360
It's all right, Doc.

52:01.486 --> 52:02.903
I'm used to it.

52:04.489 --> 52:05.573
Fine.

52:06.866 --> 52:09.201
Miss Cisneros, we've received your results.

52:09.284 --> 52:10.578
I'm dying, I know.

52:12.329 --> 52:14.248
Well... yes, that's true.

52:15.082 --> 52:17.167
- But...
- Look, Doc...

52:18.669 --> 52:21.130
I don't need any bullshit about...

52:21.213 --> 52:25.385
percentages or millimeters or stages.

52:28.888 --> 52:34.101
Do me a favor and talk
to me like you would if...

52:34.894 --> 52:37.229
I was a person you loved.

52:42.026 --> 52:43.569
The chemo's not working.

52:44.654 --> 52:46.155
This cancer is aggressive.

52:53.996 --> 52:55.873
How long I got?

52:57.458 --> 53:00.127
Three to six weeks, I'd say.

53:07.092 --> 53:08.719
Thank you.

53:10.638 --> 53:12.473
You hear that, my love?

53:12.557 --> 53:14.934
Mommy's not going far away.

53:15.017 --> 53:16.727
She's staying right here.

53:16.811 --> 53:18.729
So we can see her...

53:21.148 --> 53:22.399
kiss her...

53:22.483 --> 53:25.110
and tell her all about how our day was...

53:25.194 --> 53:28.155
and how we read that book Fraidyzoo...

53:28.238 --> 53:30.115
and how your diaper leaked
all over Daddy's pants.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.368
That's right.

53:33.453 --> 53:35.580
We're very excited, right, baby?

53:35.663 --> 53:37.790
We are so excited.

53:38.791 --> 53:39.834
Aren't we?

53:42.211 --> 53:43.504
Yeah.

53:43.588 --> 53:45.840
Do you hate us?

53:45.923 --> 53:47.174
Please tell us you don't hate us...

53:47.257 --> 53:51.637
because you're still my best friend
and I don't have a lot of women friends,

53:51.721 --> 53:55.224
and I love you, and I can't imagine
a world where you're not my friend.

53:56.892 --> 53:58.185
We want your blessing.

53:59.562 --> 54:01.355
You're kidding me, right?

54:01.438 --> 54:03.315
You did cheat on me.

54:03.398 --> 54:05.526
That doesn't mean I don't
get to have feelings.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.528
If only my nipples smelled like marzipan.

54:07.612 --> 54:09.864
You told him that?

54:10.990 --> 54:12.617
Oh, Jesus...

54:12.700 --> 54:16.036
He didn't need to know what
Alex's nipples smelled like.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.706
It weirdly made him
feel better for a minute.

54:19.624 --> 54:21.291
Fuck you.

54:22.251 --> 54:23.460
Fuck both of you.

54:24.253 --> 54:25.254
You're right.

54:25.337 --> 54:26.631
She's right. Ugh...

54:27.882 --> 54:28.883
This is so insane.

54:28.966 --> 54:30.551
I'm so sorry. We shouldn't have come.

54:30.635 --> 54:32.261
No, no.

54:33.804 --> 54:35.472
We talked about this. It makes sense.

54:40.144 --> 54:41.646
- Pipes...
- Stop it.

54:44.148 --> 54:45.190
Fine.

54:46.609 --> 54:49.278
But let's be realistic about this.

54:51.030 --> 54:53.783
We both have known you a really long time.

54:53.866 --> 54:57.578
It's not like you're suddenly
gonna disappear out of our lives.

54:57.662 --> 55:00.581
That's... that's not what we want at least.

55:02.249 --> 55:04.710
We? Oh, God...

55:04.794 --> 55:07.171
Oh, God, gross.

55:07.254 --> 55:08.923
Can we be adults about this, please?

55:09.006 --> 55:10.675
Sure.

55:10.758 --> 55:11.842
Okay.

55:13.761 --> 55:15.387
Let's be adults.

55:15.470 --> 55:19.809
Let's get this all out on the table...
just so that we're clear, okay?

55:19.892 --> 55:21.561
The first person...

55:21.644 --> 55:23.103
that you fuck...

55:24.063 --> 55:25.606
after we break up...

55:26.440 --> 55:28.358
is my best friend.

55:28.442 --> 55:30.027
My married...

55:30.986 --> 55:32.863
best friend.

55:34.323 --> 55:35.324
And you...

55:36.158 --> 55:37.993
you have a newborn.

55:40.079 --> 55:42.289
I mean, was your vagina
even fuckable at that point

55:42.372 --> 55:45.500
or were you just squirting
your milk all over him?

55:46.418 --> 55:48.003
And then you did the worst thing.

55:48.087 --> 55:49.088
You decided...

55:50.464 --> 55:52.007
to fall in love.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.928
And then you thought, "You
know what'd be a great idea?

55:56.011 --> 55:59.640
"Let's go visit... Piper in prison...

55:59.724 --> 56:01.934
"because that's where she lives...

56:02.017 --> 56:05.145
"because things are going so great for her,

56:05.229 --> 56:07.272
"and let's sit across from her...

56:08.523 --> 56:10.985
"and ask for her blessing...

56:11.068 --> 56:14.196
"so that we can walk
away... feeling absolved

56:14.279 --> 56:18.367
"of all of the fucked-up
choices that we have made."

56:19.409 --> 56:20.995
You're right.

56:21.078 --> 56:22.872
It's fucked up.

56:22.955 --> 56:25.499
I know that. Larry knows that.

56:26.541 --> 56:29.503
But we didn't decide to
love each other, Piper.

56:29.586 --> 56:30.755
It just happened.

56:31.672 --> 56:33.132
The way love does.

56:39.096 --> 56:41.515
And my vagina bounced back really fast.

56:52.777 --> 56:55.404
Hey... Mr. Healy. Hi.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.407
What do you think?

56:59.408 --> 57:01.285
I prefer long hair.

57:01.368 --> 57:03.829
Hey, but it's counter-culture.

57:04.872 --> 57:06.206
Do you even know what that means?

57:06.290 --> 57:07.332
Not really.

57:09.376 --> 57:11.003
But I don't really think it matters...

57:11.086 --> 57:14.256
as long as you say your opinion
louder than everybody else's.

57:14.339 --> 57:15.716
- Have a good one, Doggett.
- Hold on.

57:15.800 --> 57:16.967
- Hey!
- Wait!

57:17.051 --> 57:18.177
I wanna talk to you.

57:18.260 --> 57:20.930
I wanna do a make-up class
for Safe Place, all right?

57:21.013 --> 57:22.306
I have a lot of free time this week.

57:22.389 --> 57:24.641
You seemed to be pretty busy yesterday.

57:24.725 --> 57:26.727
Is that why you're all sourpussed?

57:26.811 --> 57:30.230
You sad 'cause I have
another friend besides you?

57:30.981 --> 57:32.191
I thought we had the same values.

57:32.274 --> 57:34.068
We do have the same values.

57:34.151 --> 57:38.447
We like to express ourselves, and
we like to be kind to people, right?

57:39.489 --> 57:42.785
I mean, because of you, Mr.
Healy, I made a new friend,

57:42.868 --> 57:46.789
somebody that I would've never
talked to, and you know it.

57:47.456 --> 57:50.250
I mean, now, is that
something else or what?

57:50.334 --> 57:53.087
Touch me again and we're
gonna have a problem.

57:53.170 --> 57:54.254
Do you understand?

57:54.338 --> 57:55.464
All right, listen.

57:56.465 --> 57:57.591
You don't gotta talk, okay?

57:57.674 --> 58:01.595
I know you got issues with the butchies,
and you're not that far off the mark.

58:01.678 --> 58:04.932
And I know you're pissed off at
me that I didn't make it to group.

58:05.015 --> 58:07.184
Sorry, but I want you to know something.

58:08.018 --> 58:09.937
I am forever grateful to you.

58:12.106 --> 58:15.525
'Cause you're the only person...
in my whole life that's...

58:18.278 --> 58:20.364
ever taken the time to talk to me.

58:21.824 --> 58:23.325
And it just seems like...

58:23.408 --> 58:26.495
you're really good at what you
do and that you really care.

58:28.497 --> 58:32.376
And I will never finger her and
I will never let her finger me.

58:52.021 --> 58:54.231
This is all part of
making the evil go away.

59:01.405 --> 59:02.447
Okay.

59:21.258 --> 59:23.010
And the final step.

59:44.281 --> 59:46.450
Hey, hey.

59:47.659 --> 59:49.536
Why don't you tell me what happened?

59:50.704 --> 59:52.372
I hit her...

59:52.456 --> 59:54.249
and hit her...

59:54.333 --> 59:55.750
and hit her.

59:58.087 --> 59:59.171
Why did you do that?

59:59.254 --> 01:00:00.840
I don't remember.

01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:04.301
You don't remember doing it...

01:00:04.384 --> 01:00:06.428
or you don't remember why?

01:00:06.511 --> 01:00:09.056
I don't remember.

01:00:13.018 --> 01:00:14.353
Did you attack Red?

01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:16.188
Vee said I did.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:20.567
Those men who were here said
I did. Shouldn't I believe 'em?

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:21.902
No.

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:23.153
You should know what you did.

01:00:23.237 --> 01:00:26.156
I can't remember!

01:00:27.616 --> 01:00:31.620
Now, I thought I was...
mopping in the warehouse.

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:33.747
Turns out, I was slocking
in the greenhouse.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:39.378
I must... you know, I must've mixed up
"ware" and "green" or "mop" and "slock."

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:40.837
That could happen...

01:00:42.089 --> 01:00:43.090
right?

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:44.633
It's very unlikely.

01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:46.468
Yes.

01:00:47.552 --> 01:00:49.054
But who can I trust?

01:00:49.138 --> 01:00:50.430
Yourself.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.851
No.

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:57.980
No.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:02.192
I'm unreliable.

01:01:07.572 --> 01:01:09.158
Is Red gonna be okay?

01:01:10.951 --> 01:01:12.536
I always liked her.

01:01:13.328 --> 01:01:15.956
She's... scary,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.794
but... her hair is like the Heat
Miser in that Christmas special...

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:21.921
don't you think?

01:01:24.965 --> 01:01:28.843
She's, uh... Mrs. Green Christmas.

01:01:28.928 --> 01:01:30.387
She's Mrs. Sun.

01:01:33.515 --> 01:01:34.641
Yeah.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:39.438
So...

01:01:42.816 --> 01:01:45.527
what's gonna happen to me now?

01:01:53.285 --> 01:01:57.247
Oh, good, you're packing up.

01:01:57.331 --> 01:02:01.001
I just got word that I am
officially taking over your job.

01:02:03.503 --> 01:02:06.506
Permanently or interim
till they find someone real?

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:08.675
He's giving you a trial run, isn't he?

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.927
What is it, 48 hours, 72?

01:02:11.011 --> 01:02:13.763
Can you not fuck up for a few
days? There's a real challenge.

01:02:13.847 --> 01:02:15.599
Meanwhile...

01:02:15.682 --> 01:02:21.313
your shapely ass is canned while
mine is sitting in that chair.

01:02:21.396 --> 01:02:24.149
I wasn't canned. I resigned.

01:02:24.233 --> 01:02:26.526
I am leaving with a
commendation from the warden

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.154
about my dedicated service
to this institution,

01:02:29.238 --> 01:02:33.158
and a press release about how
sad he is that I have decided

01:02:33.242 --> 01:02:37.871
to devote myself to politics and
possibly motherhood full-time.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:40.082
How the fuck do you do that?

01:02:40.874 --> 01:02:42.876
How do you keep getting away with shit?

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.419
I'm not getting away with anything.

01:02:44.503 --> 01:02:45.712
The warden is simply smart enough

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:48.048
to realize he doesn't
want a scandal on his hands

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:51.510
and he doesn't wanna make a
political enemy of my husband.

01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:53.803
Your gay husband?

01:02:56.056 --> 01:02:57.474
Your band sucks.

01:02:57.557 --> 01:02:59.226
Your blowjobs suck.

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:03.897
I was good at my job, Joe.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.983
It was complicated but I made it work.

01:03:07.067 --> 01:03:08.277
Let's see how you do.

01:03:09.903 --> 01:03:11.613
Well, I figure, for starters,

01:03:11.696 --> 01:03:15.867
if I simply don't embezzle
and lie and neglect...

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:19.246
Oh, save it. I'm tired and I'm leaving.

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:22.916
Good luck with your noble intentions.
This place'll beat 'em out of you quick.

01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:38.807
Well, Amanda has a theory
that it's all because of

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:42.227
the cycle of poverty and the bad
schools and the government cheese

01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:45.439
and because I'm brown
and my mom was on crack.

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:48.692
But I think it's because...

01:03:48.775 --> 01:03:50.152
I was just being an asshole.

01:03:50.235 --> 01:03:52.779
I thought you said no mushy shit.

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:55.699
I'm sorry, P. I really am.

01:03:57.284 --> 01:04:00.495
Yeah, well... Mackenzie thinks
it's repressed frustration

01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:01.621
'cause you ain't never been to Paris.

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:04.499
It's probably that, too.

01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:05.584
Oh, shit.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.461
Outlander.

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:09.213
- You ever read this?
- Nah.

01:04:09.296 --> 01:04:11.881
Lady travels back in time
to Scotland and some shit,

01:04:11.965 --> 01:04:17.971
hooks up with this big sexy outlaw type
and they be gettin' it day in and day out.

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.055
Yo, it's hot!

01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:22.976
But the dude's, like... pale with red hair.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.144
Not my thing.

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:27.939
But if I go back in
time, I go back to Africa.

01:04:28.022 --> 01:04:31.860
I find me a Nubian king
with a Nubian thing.

01:04:35.864 --> 01:04:38.950
Yo, look, when I was a kid, my parents
rented that movie Back to the Future.

01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:40.577
I was mad convinced.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.454
So, like, every time I left the house,

01:04:42.537 --> 01:04:45.832
my backpack was full of stuff
just in case I went back in time.

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:48.460
I was all ready for my DeLorean...

01:04:48.543 --> 01:04:49.544
but it never came.

01:04:53.382 --> 01:04:55.091
Yo, P.

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:56.593
The fuck do y'all want, man?

01:04:56.676 --> 01:04:59.179
Chill, you fuckin' book
ninja. We come in peace.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:01.681
For real. This shit's gone too far.

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:04.351
Yeah, well, took you fucking
long enough to notice.

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:06.353
That bitch went crazy on my ass.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.939
"Where's my shit? Where's my
shit?" She cracked wide open.

01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:13.527
Wait. What shit? Her shit shit?

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:14.778
Oh, shit.

01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:17.071
Went missing, yeah.

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:19.032
She's out of her mind.

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:20.950
Guessing she'll be coming after y'all next.

01:05:21.034 --> 01:05:22.286
Yo, but we ain't got her shit.

01:05:22.369 --> 01:05:24.913
She talkin' about takin'
everybody out for it.

01:05:24.996 --> 01:05:26.915
Look, I don't care if y'all got it or not.

01:05:26.998 --> 01:05:27.999
I just wanna know

01:05:28.082 --> 01:05:31.586
I'm not getting slocked in my
bed or shanked on the dooker.

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:33.004
Yo, if she's suspecting y'all,

01:05:33.087 --> 01:05:35.674
then that means she ain't
got no people no more...

01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:37.133
except Crazy Eyes.

01:05:37.217 --> 01:05:41.305
Mmm-mmm, Crazy Eyes be out with
SIS takin' the fall for doin' Red.

01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:44.224
Vee got that noodle-brain
convinced she did it.

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:45.809
We kind of helped with that, too.

01:05:45.892 --> 01:05:48.395
I hope you right with
your God with that one.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:51.105
Hey, don't make us try and
feel badder than we already do.

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:54.943
Y'all was with Vee, too. Y'all
was doing sketchy shit, too.

01:05:56.611 --> 01:05:59.364
She must really be losin'
it over them drugs, huh?

01:05:59.448 --> 01:06:00.782
Lost it.

01:06:00.865 --> 01:06:02.158
Yo, maybe we can make this right.

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:07.456
I mean... Vee got no one. We all talkin'.

01:06:07.539 --> 01:06:09.749
- So we jump her? Pow, pow, pow!
- Yo, don't!

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:10.834
I'm in.

01:06:10.917 --> 01:06:13.462
No... I don't think we need to do all that.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:19.343
Okay... I made an effort.

01:06:24.889 --> 01:06:26.182
It's your turn.

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:29.394
Eat something.

01:06:29.478 --> 01:06:30.687
Uh...

01:06:34.774 --> 01:06:37.861
Fine.

01:07:03.637 --> 01:07:05.138
Okay, Sister.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:06.640
I've stopped your transfer.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:09.809
I was being transferred?

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.937
That's right. You, Chapman
and a bunch of others.

01:07:13.021 --> 01:07:14.856
Fig was having you all sent to Virginia.

01:07:14.939 --> 01:07:17.984
I just took care of it.
You're all staying here.

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:21.738
Aren't you glad?

01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:22.822
Well, it...

01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:26.285
it's hard to be emotionally invested in
something I didn't know was happening,

01:07:26.368 --> 01:07:29.746
but... yes, I... I
suppose that's good news.

01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:30.872
Good.

01:07:31.665 --> 01:07:33.292
I've done you a solid.

01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:35.835
Now would you do something for me?

01:07:37.379 --> 01:07:38.588
Eat something.

01:07:39.298 --> 01:07:42.301
Don't eat a thing,
Ingalls. Fight the power.

01:07:42.384 --> 01:07:44.218
Red, you're not helping.

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.265
Look...

01:07:53.019 --> 01:07:54.270
Fig is out.

01:07:55.397 --> 01:07:56.398
I'm in.

01:07:56.481 --> 01:07:58.608
Give me a win here.

01:07:58.692 --> 01:08:01.820
Let me show the administration
I can handle situations.

01:08:03.405 --> 01:08:05.281
I wanna make a difference, Sister.

01:08:06.199 --> 01:08:07.826
Would you do that for me?

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:08.910
Here...

01:08:12.706 --> 01:08:14.624
I brought you a muffin.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.586
Go ahead.

01:08:19.002 --> 01:08:21.255
Go ahead... take a bite.

01:08:22.006 --> 01:08:23.841
We'll call it a day.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.470
Yeah.

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:31.390
Go ahead.

01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.399
Excellent. All right.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.274
Attagirl.

01:08:43.944 --> 01:08:46.154
Now would you mind calling off your nuns?

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:51.327
Luschek.

01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:52.662
Need to ask you something.

01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:56.416
- You can buy it on the Internet.
- What?

01:08:58.752 --> 01:09:00.294
Whatever you're looking for.

01:09:00.379 --> 01:09:03.339
I guess I could help you
with what words to type in.

01:09:03.423 --> 01:09:05.759
Do I wanna know that much about you?

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.386
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.764
I need to ask you about Warren.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:12.098
Who?

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.349
Crazy Eyes.

01:09:13.433 --> 01:09:14.434
Oh.

01:09:16.478 --> 01:09:20.189
You might've seen her in electrical
around the time Red got slocked.

01:09:20.273 --> 01:09:23.402
Cleaning up, sweeping the
floor, something like that.

01:09:25.487 --> 01:09:28.156
I, uh... might have.

01:09:29.783 --> 01:09:31.075
Well, that's great.

01:09:32.285 --> 01:09:34.120
I need an interdepartmental work order

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.457
showing the specific time
that she reported to you.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:39.459
And, uh...

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.587
you would owe me a big one
for lying for you, right?

01:09:42.671 --> 01:09:45.840
You know, something to be
determined at a later date?

01:09:45.924 --> 01:09:47.050
Sure.

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:49.385
Fine.

01:09:51.763 --> 01:09:53.557
Here's the form.

01:09:54.599 --> 01:09:55.642
Oh!

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.645
This is gonna be fun.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:09:59.729
Turn around.

01:10:04.693 --> 01:10:05.860
Thanks, Luschek.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:12.075
Hey, Taystee.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:14.744
How's my girl?

01:10:14.828 --> 01:10:16.621
Who? Me?

01:10:16.705 --> 01:10:18.164
Come on, now.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.544
I had to teach you a little
lesson, but... the time out is over.

01:10:22.627 --> 01:10:23.878
Come on back.

01:10:23.962 --> 01:10:25.004
Play with Mama.

01:10:26.005 --> 01:10:27.841
I think I'll stay in the corner.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.509
And while you in that corner, look around.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:30.844
You wouldn't happen to be hiding

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:34.180
a big box of something
that's not yours, would you?

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.474
I didn't take your shit.

01:10:35.557 --> 01:10:36.808
But you know who did!

01:10:36.891 --> 01:10:37.934
Hey, guys.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:39.978
What's going on?

01:10:43.022 --> 01:10:45.900
This... does not concern you.

01:10:50.196 --> 01:10:51.615
Taystee, we've been together long enough.

01:10:51.698 --> 01:10:57.411
I don't have to remind you... what
happens when someone oversteps.

01:11:02.208 --> 01:11:03.502
You mean like RJ?

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.546
Yes.

01:11:07.589 --> 01:11:08.840
Like RJ.

01:11:13.052 --> 01:11:15.054
You'd be 10 years dead now.

01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:17.932
You'd be just another anonymous black child

01:11:18.016 --> 01:11:21.019
buried six deep in a county field.

01:11:23.271 --> 01:11:25.064
Here's the thing about mamas.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:28.985
They're only mamas as
long as they got kids.

01:11:29.068 --> 01:11:30.403
Without 'em, what are they?

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:33.156
Uh... nothing.

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:35.617
You got to have people.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.369
Especially in here, you just got to.

01:11:38.452 --> 01:11:42.791
Otherwise, you find yourself
vulnerable to all sorts of shit.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.419
Lots of locks.

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.755
Lots of socks.

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.635
You're turning me out?

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:57.388
Fuck you.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.100
You think I can't survive?

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:04.353
I will find a new family.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:07.356
'Course you will.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.612
As long as there's psychos like you,
there's always people willing to follow.

01:12:12.696 --> 01:12:15.364
Yeah, I'm sure you'll find all
sorts of new suckers over at max.

01:12:15.448 --> 01:12:17.491
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:12:17.576 --> 01:12:20.620
See, we feel real bad about Suzanne.

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:22.581
So we about to... What's
that... what's that word?

01:12:22.664 --> 01:12:24.415
Recant.

01:12:24.498 --> 01:12:27.627
Yeah, we about to recant our shit.

01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:30.755
Yeah, you know who made up
that "never snitch" bullshit?

01:12:31.923 --> 01:12:34.550
People who probably
deserved to be snitched on.

01:12:35.802 --> 01:12:37.470
Taystee.

01:12:39.973 --> 01:12:41.515
My Taystee Girl.

01:12:49.816 --> 01:12:51.901
You break my heart.

01:12:54.863 --> 01:12:56.280
Might be true...

01:12:57.365 --> 01:12:58.658
if you had one.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.307
Hey, you know what I was thinking?

01:13:23.391 --> 01:13:25.769
You ever seen Toy Story 2?

01:13:25.852 --> 01:13:29.188
You know, it's hard to believe,
but it's better than the first one.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:34.277
And even though sequels never are...
this? This is the exception to the rule.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.697
So, I was thinking, maybe we could
get them to play it next week.

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:39.991
Wouldn't that be good, huh?

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:41.617
She's done.

01:13:42.493 --> 01:13:44.203
Done, done.

01:13:45.496 --> 01:13:48.667
Only has a few more weeks.
That's what the doc said.

01:13:50.501 --> 01:13:53.629
Man... it's real fucked
up to die in prison, right?

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.591
I mean, it's fucked up
to die, period, but...

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:00.136
this is really, I mean...

01:14:02.096 --> 01:14:03.723
it's fucked up.

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.617
Man, I love this one.

01:14:30.416 --> 01:14:32.251
Chapman.

01:14:32.335 --> 01:14:33.962
Yeah?

01:14:34.045 --> 01:14:36.297
You were right, you know?

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.507
What you said to me when I first got here.

01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:40.384
What did I say?

01:14:40.468 --> 01:14:42.595
You told me to find a wife...

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:45.098
someone to look out for me.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:46.224
I should've listened.

01:14:46.307 --> 01:14:48.517
Yeah, I was fucking with you.

01:14:49.853 --> 01:14:50.854
I know.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.106
But you were right.

01:14:55.984 --> 01:14:58.486
God, this is the loneliest
place I've ever been

01:14:58.569 --> 01:15:00.822
and I lived alone in a
tree for eight months.

01:15:01.906 --> 01:15:03.825
Yeah, you're pretty
much on your own in here.

01:15:03.908 --> 01:15:05.201
It sucks.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.662
And no one understands.

01:15:08.747 --> 01:15:12.333
Like, Meadow asked if she
could send me a care package.

01:15:12.416 --> 01:15:14.919
She thinks this is camp.

01:15:15.003 --> 01:15:18.256
But it's not. It's... awful.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:24.971
I don't think I'm gonna
be the same when I get out.

01:15:27.515 --> 01:15:28.808
Maybe that's okay.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.227
It's not fucking okay.

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:35.731
I know.

01:15:46.826 --> 01:15:48.577
Miss Warren.

01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:50.997
Miss Warren!

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.581
The authorities will be here soon

01:15:52.665 --> 01:15:56.419
to transfer you to another facility
to await trial on this charge.

01:15:56.502 --> 01:15:58.087
Mmm.

01:15:58.171 --> 01:16:00.006
Thank you for your cooperation.

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:05.261
Oh! "We say 'thank you, ' we say 'please,
' and 'excuse me, ' when we sneeze.

01:16:05.344 --> 01:16:10.099
"That's the way we do what's right.
We have manners. We're polite."

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.359
What?

01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:22.695
You wanna go home or not, huh?

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.989
I'm supposed to meet Cheryl
at the White Horse tonight.

01:16:31.245 --> 01:16:32.538
Fine.

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:36.209
Good day, sir. I say, "Good day."

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:39.838
Thank you very much. Thank you
very much. No, thank you very much.

01:16:39.921 --> 01:16:42.340
No, thank you very much.
Thank you very, very much.

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:43.507
Thank you very much.

01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:45.634
Thank you. Go. Bye.

01:16:45.718 --> 01:16:47.053
Excuse me, I need to recant my testimony.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:48.221
Hey, hey, I got new information.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.388
- It was Vee Parker.
- Yes.

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:51.182
- Vee Parker did it.
- Yo, you gotta believe us.

01:16:51.265 --> 01:16:53.809
It might've seemed like it was Crazy
Eyes 'cause that bitch is crazy,

01:16:53.893 --> 01:16:55.061
but it was not her.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:57.063
Yeah, justice is not being served.

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:58.439
Ladies, I'm sorry. We're done for the day.

01:16:58.522 --> 01:16:59.565
- No! No!
- Where is security?

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.567
Is there a CO around here?

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.736
Ladies, I strongly suggest
you clear this hallway.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.571
- Just listen for one sec!
- It was Vee Parker!

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:07.490
Hold up. Hold up.

01:17:07.573 --> 01:17:09.993
Oh, good, Mr. Healy,
please control your inmates.

01:17:10.076 --> 01:17:11.911
Control? We don't need control.

01:17:12.954 --> 01:17:14.663
I have a work order here.

01:17:14.747 --> 01:17:18.334
There's no way Warren could've
done it. She was in electrical.

01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:20.669
You gotta let her go. Case is still open.

01:17:22.213 --> 01:17:23.839
Shit.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.385
You should call Cheryl.

01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:28.928
Yeah, you should call Cheryl.

01:17:29.012 --> 01:17:31.305
"Honey, I'm gonna be home late."

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:37.020
Jesus.

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.689
Come in.

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:45.528
Welcome, John!

01:17:46.654 --> 01:17:48.197
Huh?

01:17:48.948 --> 01:17:50.199
You like my new office?

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:53.827
Yeah, it's, uh... it's very nice.

01:17:55.829 --> 01:17:57.206
Look, Mr. Caputo...

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.586
I can't be a pussy anymore. I have to...

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:04.047
stand up and be a man.

01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:05.339
Oh, no, don't.

01:18:05.423 --> 01:18:07.591
Please don't tell me you
busted up another dorm.

01:18:07.675 --> 01:18:09.135
- I can't...
- Daya's baby's mine.

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:12.721
The baby's mine.

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:15.934
I got her pregnant and she got scared,

01:18:16.017 --> 01:18:19.812
so she had sex with Mendez so
that I wouldn't get blamed, but...

01:18:20.854 --> 01:18:23.441
I have to step up. It's,
uh... it's my child...

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:25.109
- Stop talking.
- It's my child. It's my baby.

01:18:25.193 --> 01:18:26.945
I said, "Stop talking."

01:18:34.202 --> 01:18:36.662
Jesus tits.

01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:40.666
It's my second day.

01:18:41.584 --> 01:18:42.710
I can't.

01:18:43.627 --> 01:18:45.754
I can't... I can't have this.

01:18:48.216 --> 01:18:49.217
No.

01:18:51.344 --> 01:18:52.345
This has been dealt with.

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:54.680
But the baby's mine.
Mendez is being prosecuted.

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.016
'Cause Mendez fucked her.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.101
So did I!

01:18:58.184 --> 01:18:59.893
No, you didn't.

01:18:59.978 --> 01:19:01.854
Sir, I... I fucked her.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.689
Do you love this girl, Bennett?

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.069
I do.

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:11.530
Then I suggest you keep your mouth shut

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:15.868
or I will send your love,
the town pump of Litchfield,

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:19.038
to a max facility where she
will spend her days in a cage

01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:22.250
away from you and her
mother and her friends

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:26.379
until she delivers your child with
her hands and feet cuffed to a bed.

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:32.468
What do you want, Bennett?

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:36.222
Nothing, sir.

01:19:37.723 --> 01:19:38.766
Good.

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:45.814
It's my second day.

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:50.819
My second fucking day.

01:19:52.196 --> 01:19:53.322
Get out of here.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:57.118
Yes, sir.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.587
An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:09.922
is attempting to contact you.

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:13.008
To accept this call, please press one.

01:20:13.092 --> 01:20:14.718
- Should we take that?
- It's Piper.

01:20:15.803 --> 01:20:16.804
We have to.

01:20:20.391 --> 01:20:21.434
Piper.

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:23.186
Hi, are you alone?

01:20:24.937 --> 01:20:27.022
I'm in the car with
Polly. You're on speaker.

01:20:27.106 --> 01:20:30.109
Ah! Of course I am.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.111
Listen, do you wanna make it up to me?

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:36.031
Depends on what that means.

01:20:36.115 --> 01:20:37.283
I need a favor.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:41.036
And, Larry, if you're
not willing to do this...

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.497
then, Polly, I'm asking you.

01:20:43.581 --> 01:20:44.582
What is it?

01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:47.876
There's a probation officer
and his name is David Crockett.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.128
Just like Davy Crockett.

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:53.716
He probably works for the federal division
of the Queens County probation office.

01:20:53.799 --> 01:20:56.260
I'm sure that you can
find the bureau online.

01:20:56.344 --> 01:20:57.345
Okay.

01:20:57.428 --> 01:21:00.889
I need you to call him and tell him...

01:21:02.015 --> 01:21:07.813
that Alex Vause is violating her probation

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:11.859
and that she is on her way out of town.

01:21:11.942 --> 01:21:13.068
Is that true?

01:21:13.152 --> 01:21:14.237
Yes.

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:16.947
And the purpose of this is what?

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:22.077
Larry, I am giving you the opportunity
to fuck over someone that you hate.

01:21:23.662 --> 01:21:25.331
And why would I do that?

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:27.416
So she lands back in there with you?

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.042
Polly?

01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:34.340
What's the office called, again?

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.653
Where is she?

01:21:59.198 --> 01:22:00.949
Anybody seen Parker?

01:22:03.452 --> 01:22:04.703
Parker?

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:08.957
You don't know where your inmates are?

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:31.647
Hello?

01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:33.566
Jesus.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:38.487
Okay.

01:23:02.261 --> 01:23:04.597
The laundry room where the meth heads work?

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.849
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- I was thinking

01:23:06.932 --> 01:23:10.728
it's a place big enough to hold
it and it would have to do for now.

01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:11.812
All right.

01:23:12.646 --> 01:23:13.772
Oh, come on.

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:16.066
Start stuffing these down your
pants and head back to the warehouse.

01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:18.652
I'll grab Caputo. We lead him
to it and we nail the bitch.

01:23:18.736 --> 01:23:19.778
Wait a minute.

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:21.029
You want me to walk from
here to the warehouse

01:23:21.113 --> 01:23:23.324
with heroin stuffed in my pants?

01:23:23.407 --> 01:23:24.408
No fucking way.

01:23:24.492 --> 01:23:27.786
Come on, you're already
bulky. No one's gonna notice.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.121
Ha.

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.706
How'd you get it here in the first place?

01:23:30.789 --> 01:23:32.458
Laundry bag. I hid it in some clothes.

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.585
You know, it makes sense to go
to laundry with a bag of clothes.

01:23:34.668 --> 01:23:37.671
Makes no sense to go to the warehouse
with a laundry bag of clothes.

01:23:37.755 --> 01:23:39.131
Yeah, well, here's an idea.

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:42.301
Why didn't you just leave
it there in a different spot?

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:43.386
- Seriously?
- Uh-huh.

01:23:43.469 --> 01:23:45.095
You know she tore that place apart.

01:23:45.178 --> 01:23:48.181
If it was me, I would've
torn that place apart.

01:23:49.642 --> 01:23:51.018
You know, Nicky...

01:23:52.102 --> 01:23:54.272
what if Caputo doesn't
believe that this is Vee's?

01:23:54.355 --> 01:23:55.773
I mean, what if he thinks it's ours?

01:23:58.692 --> 01:24:01.236
Maybe we should keep it?

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.655
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit!

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:07.660
Everybody down?

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:08.744
Good.

01:24:08.827 --> 01:24:09.953
What's going on?

01:24:10.037 --> 01:24:11.038
Parker's missing.

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:22.550
Stay here.

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:31.892
What's going on?

01:24:32.935 --> 01:24:34.186
An inmate is missing.

01:24:35.521 --> 01:24:37.189
Back to your bunks for count.

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:38.273
All right.

01:24:38.357 --> 01:24:40.192
Come on, son. We'll deal with this later.

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:44.029
All inmates, return to your
bunks for count immediately.

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:45.113
Nichols?

01:24:48.451 --> 01:24:51.454
This prison is officially on lockdown.

01:24:51.537 --> 01:24:55.040
Please remain in your
bunks until further notice.

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.917
Holy shit, we got a runner.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.794
You ever had a runner before?

01:24:59.503 --> 01:25:00.546
No.

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:02.005
Oh, it's fun.

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:38.417
Don't take another step!

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:40.002
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey!

01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:43.255
What the fuck?

01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:45.048
Can I help you?

01:25:45.132 --> 01:25:46.759
I didn't know you were home.

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:49.970
I don't fucking care. You can't
just walk into my apartment!

01:25:50.053 --> 01:25:52.055
Yeah, I know that... usually, but...

01:25:52.139 --> 01:25:54.016
he asked me to.

01:25:57.686 --> 01:25:58.771
Mr. Crockett.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:00.230
Miss Vause.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:02.190
Fuck.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.612
And you will remain in your
bunks until further notice.

01:26:06.695 --> 01:26:09.239
No exceptions, no excuses.

01:26:09.322 --> 01:26:10.574
Fall out.

01:26:30.093 --> 01:26:34.473
A-Dorm, B-Dorm, C-Dorm,
we are on lockdown.

01:26:34.557 --> 01:26:37.267
Return to your area immediately.

01:26:42.815 --> 01:26:44.650
You got some good hair, girl.

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:48.153
Almost that Tracee Ellis
Ross biracial texture.

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:49.988
Almost.

01:26:50.072 --> 01:26:51.323
It's a little dry, though.

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:54.660
I need to get you a co-wash,
maybe a hot oil treatment.

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:58.330
-... 15, 16, 17...
- Oh, wait. No, keep your leg straight.

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:00.373
Yeah, 17, 18...

01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:05.170
for, like, over 15 years.
That woman was fucking insane.

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:06.672
Then fuckin' ditched your ass.

01:27:06.755 --> 01:27:09.508
But you... how y'all gonna
diss me like y'all did before?

01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:35.117
Fuck it.

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:42.666
Don't die in here, Miss
Rosa. Go do it your own way.

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:44.084
What do I do?

01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:47.755
Go fast.

01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:58.473
Prison's on lockdown.

01:27:58.557 --> 01:28:00.726
We need to get her back to
rooms and get you back...

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:03.270
- What the fuck?
- Oh, lord in heaven!

01:28:03.353 --> 01:28:05.105
- Oh, shit. Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:28:05.188 --> 01:28:06.565
Rosa, come back here!

01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:08.483
You're gonna get in big trouble, Rosa!

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:17.576
What's going on with the alarms?

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:20.162
As far as you're concerned,
we're just testing the system.

01:28:20.245 --> 01:28:21.664
Now tell me again what you're gonna say.

01:28:22.581 --> 01:28:25.250
"I've elected to end my hunger strike."

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:27.044
That's right.

01:28:27.127 --> 01:28:28.921
I feel like a shill.

01:28:29.004 --> 01:28:30.923
Greater good, Ingalls. Eye on the prize.

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:32.507
Go on.

01:28:32.591 --> 01:28:37.262
"Thanks to the efforts of you, my sisters,
the administration has heard our outcry

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:40.766
"and is taking steps to
address our complaints."

01:28:43.602 --> 01:28:47.480
"Beginning with the appointment
of Assistant Warden Joe Caputo."

01:28:51.318 --> 01:28:52.570
What the fuck?

01:28:52.653 --> 01:28:54.529
O'Neill, scatter the nuns!

01:28:55.322 --> 01:28:57.490
Run, nuns! Run!

01:28:57.575 --> 01:28:58.576
Run!

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:11.046
Oh, fuck!

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:40.826
And that backup is due to road work

01:29:40.909 --> 01:29:43.370
that's going to be going on
probably until tomorrow night.

01:29:43.453 --> 01:29:45.580
Now if you're traveling
eastbound on Duncan...

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.608
Always so rude, that one.
