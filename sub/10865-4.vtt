What are you doing?

00:33.400 --> 00:34.840
What does
is it look like?

00:34.840 --> 00:36.160
This isn't a picnic.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
Lighten up, chief.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.000
Have some mustard.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.920
Look what you did.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.520
Oh, get this stuff
out of here right now.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.160
Killjoy.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
I'm not really
comfortable with this.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.760
I don't blame you.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.720
What have you got?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.360
Makeup.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.520
What for?

00:56.520 --> 00:58.040
Family portrait.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.880
My mother wants me
to get made up.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.760
So, what's the big deal?

01:06.760 --> 01:10.080
I just don't like the idea
of changing your looks

01:10.080 --> 01:12.560
to fit somebody else's idea
of what beauty is.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.440
It's just a little makeup.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.120
I know. And it's fine
for some people,

01:17.120 --> 01:19.120
but I think we all

01:19.120 --> 01:21.920
sometimes place
too much importance on looks.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.720
I'll chow to that.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.000
That's what my story's
about--

01:27.000 --> 01:29.680
some people spend
a whole lot of time

01:29.680 --> 01:31.000
worrying about their looks,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.240
but looks
can be deceiving,

01:34.240 --> 01:38.000
and sometimes mirrors lie.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.240
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:42.240 --> 01:44.280
I call this story...

02:14.320 --> 02:18.440

03:02.920 --> 03:04.840
Did you tell her
I was coming?

03:04.840 --> 03:07.800
No. But don't worry
about it. She's cool.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.360
Are you sure
about this?

03:11.360 --> 03:14.360
Yes, Miss Valenti's
gonna love you.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.840
What happened to the girl
who used to work here?

03:18.840 --> 03:21.840
She ran away from home.
Can you believe it?

03:21.840 --> 03:23.640
Nobody knows
where she went.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.360
She ran away?

03:34.360 --> 03:36.040
That's what the
police said. Hi, Vicki.

03:36.040 --> 03:36.800
Hi.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.360
Um, where's
Miss Valenti?

03:39.360 --> 03:41.480
How should I know?

03:43.680 --> 03:46.040
I saw that.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.360
Come on. The store
doesn't open

03:49.360 --> 03:50.320
for another
half an hour.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.600
Here. Let's see.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.840
Some lipstick,
a little blush,

03:56.840 --> 03:58.280
and you'll
look great.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.000
I'll look
like zebo the clown.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.400
You won't. You
should have seen Vicki

04:02.400 --> 04:04.000
when she
first came here.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.840
What a bowser.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.240
Ha ha.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.480
What are you doing?

04:11.480 --> 04:14.080
I'm giving my friend
a little touch-up.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.200
Free stuff is only
for employees.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.320
Chill out.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.079
Want to pass me that
blush over there?

04:21.079 --> 04:23.080
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.480
Oh, great.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.560
I'm sorry.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.280
This is a new dress.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.640
Here, I'll clean it up.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.480
Laurel, let me know
next time you bring in

04:31.480 --> 04:33.280
<i>one of your duh friends.</i>

04:33.280 --> 04:35.080
I will wear something old.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.520
Good morning, ladies.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.320
Oh. Hi.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.640
Morning.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.040
I have wonderful news.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.960
The new fashions just arrived
from Atlanta last night,

04:45.960 --> 04:49.960
and they are
absolutely fabulous.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.160
Of course, I want my 2
beauties to see them first.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.200
Really?

04:55.200 --> 04:58.440
Tonight at my place,
around 7:00?

04:58.440 --> 05:00.440
Cool.
I'll be there.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.280
I can't.
I have a date.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.440
Hmm. You don't know
what you're missing.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.200
Um, Miss Valenti,
this is my friend Cindy.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.480
Hello, Cindy.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.760
Hi.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.760
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

05:14.760 --> 05:17.400
I heard there might
be a job opening,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.040
'cause
the other girl left.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.400
And you'd like to apply.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
Yes.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.240
I see.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.640
Of course, the women
who shop here

05:29.640 --> 05:33.440
expect my beauties
to have a certain style.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.080
Yeah, no geeks need apply.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.040
We cater
to the very finest,

05:38.040 --> 05:40.440
and present
ourselves accordingly.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.760
I get it.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.280
Sorry to bother you.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.600
No, dear, don't leave.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.680
You might just be
a diamond in the rough.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.240
Yeah, remember Vicki?

05:54.720 --> 05:55.920
Come.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.600
I have my own
special line of products--

05:58.600 --> 06:01.280
makeup, jewelry,
a few fashions--

06:01.280 --> 06:04.160
but only
the most elegant items.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.240
When ladies come
to my store,

06:12.240 --> 06:15.240
they know that they will
be surrounded by beauty.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.960
It's an image we must
always strive to maintain.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.920
How long have you
owned this place?

06:20.920 --> 06:23.720
It seems forever.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.040
My grandma said
she used to shop here.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.560
The store's been
in my family for years.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.600
We believe that beauty is a
woman's most important asset.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.520
It's something
that must be held onto

06:37.520 --> 06:39.760
and nurtured.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.840
Never underestimate

06:40.840 --> 06:44.360
the value of true beauty
and power.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.040
Um, about the job...

06:46.040 --> 06:47.200
I don't know
if I'm right for--

06:47.200 --> 06:48.560
I hope you'll take it.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.240
Pardon?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.480
You have potential,
Cindy.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.560
I've been looking for
someone just like you.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.400
Like me?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.480
Uh-uh.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.400
You could make
a fine beauty,

07:02.400 --> 07:04.600
with a little help.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.840
I need
my watch back.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.320
You said I could have it
for a week.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.640
But I need it
back tonight.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.640
I'm going
on a date with Ron.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.160
I mean it.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.240
OK.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.920
Girls.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.160
What do you think?

07:49.080 --> 07:50.080
Wow.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.680
Wait till the guys
see you.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.120
Yeah. Like they'll notice.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.960
Oh, I'm sure they will.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.160
True beauty does not
go unrewarded.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.360
Uh, Laurel?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.760
There's people waiting.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.680
You look great.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.080
You see, Cindy?

08:08.080 --> 08:10.320
People will always
respond positively

08:10.320 --> 08:11.520
to true beauty.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.400
I guess.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.760
Now...

08:18.800 --> 08:21.720
This--a gift I give
to all my beauties.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.400
I'm sure you'll be
very happy here.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.040
Thanks.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.040
Are you OK?

08:30.040 --> 08:31.040
Yes.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.159
Yes, I'm fine.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.640
Laurel...

08:36.200 --> 08:39.200
Be a lamb and show
Cindy around the store.

08:40.559 --> 08:41.760
Just a second, Cindy.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.920
Yeah, she gave
one to me too.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.040
I'm never going
to use it.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.680
What time are
you meeting Ron?

09:21.680 --> 09:23.040
Oh, I'm supposed to--
oh, no.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.560
What?

09:24.560 --> 09:26.600
My watch--Vicki never
gave it back to me.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.720
So get it Monday.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.360
But it was from Ron,

09:29.360 --> 09:30.840
and I wanted
to wear it tonight.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.520
Well, let's go over
to Vicki's house.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.680
I don't know
where she lives.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.720
Isn't Vicki going over to
Miss Valenti's house tonight?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.840
Come on, let's go.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.320
Wow, this is so cool.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.800
Try it on.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.160
My friends would, like,
die if I got this.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.800
It's yours.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.960
Are you serious?

10:22.960 --> 10:25.920
Vicki, it was made for you.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.600
Why don't you see
for yourself?

10:35.680 --> 10:37.320
Oh. Wow.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.600
It looks...

10:38.600 --> 10:40.000
It looks--

10:40.000 --> 10:43.400
it looks any way
you want it to, Vicki.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.600
You can be attractive,
stunning,

10:47.600 --> 10:51.360
the most beautiful
woman in the world.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.520
Think of it.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.320
Everyone admiring you,

10:57.320 --> 11:00.160
wishing
they had your beauty.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.640
My beauty.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.640
Drink this, and you
can have that beauty--

11:13.640 --> 11:15.440
forever.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.840

11:49.960 --> 11:51.920
Why does she live
way out here?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.440

to be alone.

[Twigs breaking]

11:57.200 --> 11:58.440
What?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.760
I thought
I saw something.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.920
It's probably
just a skunk.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.600
Come on.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.920
I thought she was
gonna be home.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.280
Maybe we should go.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.400
No, I want
my watch back.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.720
Hello.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.880
How wonderful.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.240
My 2 beauties
have decided to visit.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.960
Come.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.840
We came
to see Vicki.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.200
She has my watch.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.840
But she never showed up.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.880
I was so disappointed.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.480
Wow.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.120
Is this the shipment
from Milan?

13:04.120 --> 13:05.440
Yes. Exquisite,
aren't they?

13:05.440 --> 13:08.160
Try something on.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.360
I'm sure you'll see
something you like.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.800
Vicki would die
if she saw this.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.200
I'm sure she would.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.680
Cindy?

13:30.680 --> 13:32.200
Why don't you join us?

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
Sure. Just...

13:34.200 --> 13:37.360
Could you tell me
where the bathroom is?

13:37.360 --> 13:40.040
It's up the stairs
and to the right.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.320
Oh. And put some
lipstick on, dear.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.320
You're looking
a bit pale.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.080
Vicki?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.560
Vicki?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.000
I want you to be

14:32.000 --> 14:34.120
one of my special
beauties, Laurel.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.160
But we should ask Cindy
to leave first.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.800
She's not really
one of us.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.200
Cindy?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.920
You can see her tomorrow.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.800
Looking pale?
Give me a break.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.360
How can you be so vain,

15:12.360 --> 15:14.480
and not have a mirror
in your bathroom?

16:17.840 --> 16:20.200
Is something wrong?

16:21.200 --> 16:24.560
Oh... no, no.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.600
We should go.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.360
We just got here.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.120
It's time we leave.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.680
You go. I want
to stay a while.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.680
But what about
your date?

16:40.680 --> 16:42.840
It's not important.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.160
I'll see you
tomorrow.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.000
But you can't just--

16:46.000 --> 16:49.520
Laurel's right. You
can see her tomorrow.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.280
But we have to leave.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.440
Laurel, come on.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.280
I think she'd like
to stay for a while.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.920
Why don't you
head home.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.200
But, she--

16:59.200 --> 17:00.520
We'll be fine, dear.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.520
I'll see to that.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.079
Good night, Cindy.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.640
See how attractive
you are?

17:44.640 --> 17:47.120
But you can be
even more beautiful.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.800
Drink this, and you
can have that beauty--

18:02.800 --> 18:05.080
forever.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.280
No! No!

18:09.200 --> 18:10.800
Laurel, get out of there.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.240
Come on.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.840
Hurry.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.640
Wait. I can't.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.840
[Groans]

18:36.840 --> 18:39.480
What's wrong?

18:39.480 --> 18:42.640
That stuff--
I think it was poison.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.000
[Coughing]

18:49.840 --> 18:51.440
[Screaming]

18:51.440 --> 18:53.920
[Howling]

18:53.920 --> 18:56.160
[Screaming]

18:56.160 --> 18:59.120
[Growling]

19:01.560 --> 19:03.680
[Barking]

19:04.920 --> 19:08.960
I finally have
my 3 beauties.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.200
[Screaming]

19:18.360 --> 19:19.440
[Howling]

19:31.720 --> 19:36.000
[Barking and whining]

20:01.200 --> 20:04.080
3 tongues of dog that spoke

20:04.080 --> 20:05.840
as woman fair.

20:07.200 --> 20:11.840
Your beauty will live
in me eternally.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.240
<i> Omnia lupanis dias.</i>

20:22.680 --> 20:25.400
What was yours
is now mine.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.840
Laurel, my dear, you
shall be my first beauty.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.200
Let them go.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.920
Give that to me.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.720
No.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.680
Change them back,
or I'll break it.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.720
What is it you want,
my child?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.280
I told you.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.280
Surely that's not all.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.560
Don't you want
to be beautiful?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.000
I can make you beautiful.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.360
Now, just give me the mirror.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.880
Stay away.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.360
Look into it, Cindy.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.360
Feel its power.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.320
That's it.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.840
Look into the mirror
and see what you desire.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.800
Think of it--

21:22.800 --> 21:25.000
how it could
change your life.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.680
Beauty can bring you
anything you want.

21:29.680 --> 21:33.920
You can be popular,
successful,

21:33.920 --> 21:35.760
and young.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.000
You can be young
for all eternity.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.240
Isn't that wonderful?

21:43.400 --> 21:48.120
Tell me, Cindy, what is
most important to you?

21:48.120 --> 21:50.200
What do you really want?

21:50.200 --> 21:51.560
What I want.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.640
Yes. Tell me.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.400
What I really want...

21:59.720 --> 22:01.760
Is my friend back.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.320
No!

22:09.120 --> 22:11.480
[Screaming]

22:13.680 --> 22:14.800
No.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.640
Cindy?

22:22.720 --> 22:23.720
Laurel!

22:26.280 --> 22:28.440
Are you OK?

22:28.440 --> 22:31.320
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.400
Hey, get me out
of here.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.680
I can't believe that.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.480
She was
so beautiful.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.440
She was a witch.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.960
Guess you can't
tell by looks

22:55.960 --> 22:57.960
if you're
a beauty

22:57.960 --> 22:59.240
or beast.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.920
Both the house

23:05.920 --> 23:08.320
and the beauty store
disappeared,

23:08.320 --> 23:10.480
so all that was left

23:10.480 --> 23:12.480
of Miss Valenti's
beautiful illusion

23:12.480 --> 23:16.600
was dust and a pile
of ugly rubble.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.840
The end.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.560
So what are you?

23:20.560 --> 23:21.760
A beauty or a beast?

23:21.760 --> 23:24.560
Neither. I'm just me,

23:24.560 --> 23:27.560
even if I'm wearing
this stuff.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.160
Are we done now?

23:30.560 --> 23:32.360
Uh, yeah.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.360
Then let's eat.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.400
All right,
who wants hot dogs?

23:41.400 --> 23:42.800
I do.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.880
[Laughter]

23:44.880 --> 23:46.280
This is great.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.280
How many you want,
Betty Ann?

23:48.280 --> 23:48.800
2.
