00:00.201 --> 00:01.236
Previously on "Heartland":

00:01.639 --> 00:03.072
What are you up to
with Spartan?

00:03.140 --> 00:04.573
I don't really know
what it is myself yet,

00:04.641 --> 00:06.575
I'm just trying
something out.

00:06.643 --> 00:07.876
Very mysterious.

00:07.943 --> 00:09.211
Did you just jump ship,

00:09.279 --> 00:10.479
or do you always come to the bar
in a swimsuit?

00:10.547 --> 00:12.981
If this were 1998,
it would make sense.

00:13.049 --> 00:14.783
How old are you,
anyway?

00:14.850 --> 00:16.318
Old enough to know

00:16.386 --> 00:17.852
I should not be wasting my time
with guys like you!

00:17.920 --> 00:18.853
Whoa! Oof!

00:18.921 --> 00:20.020
Caleb?

00:20.088 --> 00:21.355
Jack? Come here, buddy!

00:21.423 --> 00:23.891
I want you to meet
a real good friend of mine.

00:26.161 --> 00:27.228
Surf's up!

00:29.130 --> 00:30.531
<i>Hey cow!</i>

00:32.267 --> 00:33.801
Hooo!

00:35.136 --> 00:36.436
<i>Come on, cow!</i>

00:38.472 --> 00:40.674
Hey, let's call it a day, huh?

00:40.741 --> 00:41.741
What?

00:41.809 --> 00:43.343
Let's call it a day!

00:43.411 --> 00:45.178
Well, let's finish
the job first.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.746
Okay, fine.
But I'm telling you,

00:46.814 --> 00:49.416
I'm sore and I'm tired,
and my shoulder is killin' me!

00:49.483 --> 00:50.684
Don't make me cry!

00:51.784 --> 00:53.252
Two days in the saddle...

00:53.320 --> 00:55.187
Is not doing much for my back,
I'll tell you that.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.690
We should've hired some guys
to help us move these cows.

00:57.757 --> 00:58.824
Oh, quit complaining!

00:58.891 --> 01:00.826
You sound like
an old geezer.

01:00.893 --> 01:02.861
Ha-ha! Geezer!

01:02.929 --> 01:04.096
I'm not the one

01:04.163 --> 01:05.931
with the big birthday coming up,
Jack.

01:05.998 --> 01:09.133
If you're gonna whine about
every little ache and pain,

01:09.201 --> 01:11.336
God help us all
when you are my age!

01:11.403 --> 01:12.537
Oh please!

01:12.605 --> 01:13.938
You won't be around
to see that.

01:14.005 --> 01:16.040
You'll be taking a dirt nap
by then.

01:16.108 --> 01:18.476
Well, thankfully,
that's true.

01:18.544 --> 01:21.312
I won't be around to hear
all your moaning and groaning!

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.665 --> 01:42.698
Hey!

01:43.900 --> 01:45.434
Thanks for coming out.

01:45.502 --> 01:46.669
Yeah, no problem.

01:46.737 --> 01:48.537
I thought you were
coming over last night.

01:48.605 --> 01:50.573
And... the night before,

01:50.641 --> 01:52.207
and the night before that.

01:52.276 --> 01:53.776
Okay, okay.

01:53.843 --> 01:55.277
I fell asleep.

01:55.344 --> 01:56.544
You fell asleep?

01:56.612 --> 01:57.879
Well, I was working late
with Scott.

01:57.946 --> 02:00.482
I was exhausted.
I'm sorry.

02:00.549 --> 02:01.683
How about tonight?

02:01.751 --> 02:02.784
Yeah, I could come
for dinner.

02:02.851 --> 02:03.918
That'd be great,

02:03.986 --> 02:05.153
I'm tired
of my own cooking.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.087
It'd be good to catch up
with Jack, too.

02:06.155 --> 02:07.756
Oh... just Jack?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.357
No, not just Jack.

02:10.425 --> 02:11.992
Oh! Um, I'm sorry.

02:14.429 --> 02:15.462
Hello?

02:16.665 --> 02:18.231
Yep, of course.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.501
No, now-now's fine.
I'll be right there.

02:20.568 --> 02:22.169
Okay, see ya soon.

02:23.104 --> 02:24.405
I have a client
at the house.

02:24.472 --> 02:25.539
Sorry, can I...

02:25.607 --> 02:27.207
- It's okay.
- I'll see you tonight!

02:27.275 --> 02:29.041
- Okay?
- Okay.

02:29.109 --> 02:30.042
All right!

02:30.110 --> 02:31.477
Come on, Spartan,
let's go.

02:39.953 --> 02:41.521
Hello!
Is there no such thing as service?

02:41.588 --> 02:42.822
Uh, sorry!

02:42.889 --> 02:44.523
I was just downloading.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.658
What can I get for you?

02:46.726 --> 02:48.727
Can I have a cheeseburger
with tomato,

02:48.795 --> 02:50.995
relish and mustard,
but no onions or dill.

02:51.063 --> 02:52.130
Done.

02:54.266 --> 02:55.667
So, you're new?

02:55.735 --> 02:57.168
Yeah, I, um, just started.

02:58.438 --> 03:00.504
It's, uh, Austin Mars.

03:00.572 --> 03:01.706
Mallory Wells.

03:01.773 --> 03:03.173
Wells...

03:03.241 --> 03:04.908
Your dad isn't Charlie Wells,
is he?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.944
Unfortunately that's a burden
I must bear.

03:07.011 --> 03:08.346
No way!

03:08.413 --> 03:10.214
I love your dad's music,
I'm a huge fan!

03:10.281 --> 03:11.749
I won't hold it
against you.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.018
So, how long have you
been working here?

03:15.086 --> 03:17.220
Uh, just two days.

03:17.287 --> 03:19.088
But I don't know that
I'm actually gonna last.

03:19.156 --> 03:20.457
I feel your pain.

03:20.524 --> 03:23.125
I'm an ex-Maggie's
employee myself.

03:23.193 --> 03:24.627
Let's just say my last day
of employment

03:24.695 --> 03:27.430
involved three extremely hot
orders of Mac and cheese

03:27.498 --> 03:30.299
that may or may not have
ended up in a customer's lap.

03:30.368 --> 03:31.967
You're the one!

03:32.034 --> 03:33.836
You know you're a legend here,
right?

03:33.903 --> 03:35.637
<i>Excuse me!</i>

03:35.705 --> 03:37.740
Right!
I'll see ya around.

03:43.946 --> 03:45.013
Hi, Jake.

03:45.081 --> 03:46.114
Who's that?

03:53.355 --> 03:54.922
Grandpa, race you!

03:54.990 --> 03:56.090
You're on!

03:58.694 --> 03:59.727
Yah!

04:00.729 --> 04:02.730
Woo-hoo!

04:06.667 --> 04:07.767
See ya!

04:09.269 --> 04:10.303
Woo-hoo!

04:19.846 --> 04:22.181
That was quite the ride!

04:22.248 --> 04:23.481
You're in a good mood,

04:23.549 --> 04:25.184
considering I just beat you
by a mile!

04:25.251 --> 04:28.587
Oh, and considering I just
had to listen to your father

04:28.654 --> 04:30.823
whine and complain all day.

04:30.890 --> 04:32.424
About his shoulder?
Oh, his shoulder,

04:32.491 --> 04:34.659
his knee,
his... you name it!

04:35.961 --> 04:37.595
So this birthday...

04:38.530 --> 04:40.331
Huh?
What do you want?

04:40.398 --> 04:42.333
What I don't want
is a big fuss,

04:42.400 --> 04:44.368
and make sure you
tell that to your sister.

04:44.436 --> 04:46.670
What, you're not dreading
this one, are you?

04:46.739 --> 04:48.072
Nope, nope.

04:48.140 --> 04:50.007
It's not how old you are,
it's how old you feel,

04:50.075 --> 04:51.709
and I feel pretty damn good.

04:51.776 --> 04:54.577
I can still outride your dad,
I just left him in my dust.

04:54.645 --> 04:56.780
Yeah,
I know that feeling.

04:56.848 --> 04:57.848
Very funny.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.583
Amy?

05:00.651 --> 05:02.518
- Kelly James.
- Hi, Kelly.

05:02.586 --> 05:04.554
Mr. Bartlett,
right?

05:04.622 --> 05:05.822
Last time we met

05:05.890 --> 05:07.523
was under less than stellar
circumstances.

05:07.591 --> 05:09.658
Yes, your friend was...

05:09.726 --> 05:11.593
a little indisposed,
as I recall.

05:11.661 --> 05:13.528
Yep, he was a little
under the weather.

05:13.596 --> 05:14.797
Even more under
the weather next day

05:14.865 --> 05:16.465
when I made him work
a double shift.

05:16.532 --> 05:17.532
It's good to see you.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.034
Good to see you, too.

05:19.102 --> 05:20.236
So I want you
to take a look at Clover.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.470
Yeah, of course.

05:21.537 --> 05:22.604
Okay. See you later,
Mr. Bartlett.

05:22.672 --> 05:24.239
You bet.

05:24.306 --> 05:26.040
Aside from his
questionable taste in music,

05:26.108 --> 05:28.176
this Austin guy
is actually pretty cute.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.044
Almost makes me wanna work
at Maggie's again.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.814
No way, I need you here
to help me with the baby.

05:32.882 --> 05:35.750
Nice to feel appreciated.
Who knew?

05:37.286 --> 05:39.120
You still thinking about
building on the dude ranch?

05:39.188 --> 05:40.220
You sure about this?

05:40.288 --> 05:42.156
Peter is, I'm not.

05:42.223 --> 05:44.557
And he's still planning
on building it himself?

05:44.625 --> 05:46.059
That's what he says.

05:46.127 --> 05:47.527
Not good.

05:47.595 --> 05:48.962
You should think about
getting a divorce lawyer

05:49.030 --> 05:50.330
instead of an architect.

05:50.398 --> 05:51.598
What?

05:51.666 --> 05:52.800
My parents almost
killed each other

05:52.867 --> 05:54.301
when they redid
our kitchen.

05:54.368 --> 05:55.968
Renovations
and wrecked marriages

05:56.036 --> 05:57.703
go hand in hand,
trust me.

05:57.771 --> 05:58.704
Thanks, Mallory.

05:58.772 --> 05:59.705
I'm just saying!

05:59.773 --> 06:00.907
Well, don't.

06:01.975 --> 06:03.609
Oh, hi grandpa!

06:03.677 --> 06:05.511
How is your day going?

06:05.578 --> 06:07.113
Oh, couldn't be better.

06:07.181 --> 06:10.049
Nothing like an early ride
to get the blood running.

06:10.117 --> 06:11.383
<i>Great.</i>

06:11.451 --> 06:13.852
Now, um, Lisa and I have
been talking.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.420
Oh, that is never good.

06:15.487 --> 06:17.022
<i>No, listen.</i>

06:17.089 --> 06:18.623
We were thinking we would do
something a little special

06:18.691 --> 06:19.757
for this birthday of yours.

06:19.826 --> 06:21.726
Don't want anything special.

06:21.794 --> 06:23.128
Come on,
hear me out.

06:23.196 --> 06:24.529
We just wanna get
everyone together.

06:24.596 --> 06:25.697
Lou!

06:29.267 --> 06:31.135
<i>Oh...</i>

06:31.203 --> 06:32.837
What?

06:32.904 --> 06:34.104
George Tuttle.

06:34.172 --> 06:35.639
George who?

06:36.808 --> 06:38.042
George Tuttle.

06:38.109 --> 06:40.277
He played drums
in a pickup band I had

06:40.345 --> 06:42.579
back in my rodeo days,
and...

06:42.647 --> 06:44.180
What?

06:44.248 --> 06:46.015
It's an obituary,
he died.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.117
He's...

06:48.185 --> 06:49.752
He died.

07:32.093 --> 07:33.826
So, who recommended me
to you?

07:33.895 --> 07:35.896
An old friend of yours,
Chase Powers.

07:35.963 --> 07:37.230
Oh.

07:37.298 --> 07:39.099
Of course he did.

07:41.402 --> 07:44.271
Well...
He looks good,

07:44.338 --> 07:46.639
and he stands well,
nice and calm.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.140
Yeah, he looks calm,
that's why I bought him.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.675
But he's got a problem,
he's got a big problem.

07:50.743 --> 07:52.411
Yeah?

07:52.478 --> 07:54.446
What's the problem?

07:54.514 --> 07:55.480
I'll show you.

08:01.087 --> 08:03.088
Whoa! Easy!

08:03.156 --> 08:04.389
Whoa! Whoa!

08:05.824 --> 08:07.691
<i>Come on! Clover!
Clover!</i>

08:09.028 --> 08:10.194
Caleb,
get out of there!

08:10.262 --> 08:11.262
<i>You're gonna get kicked!</i>

08:11.330 --> 08:13.097
Get back!
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

08:14.499 --> 08:15.833
- Take him forward!
- I am!

08:15.901 --> 08:18.269
- Hold his head up!
- I am!

08:18.337 --> 08:19.404
<i>Caleb!</i>

08:22.273 --> 08:23.340
Whoa... easy, easy.

08:24.775 --> 08:26.209
<i>Whoa. Easy, boy.</i>

08:26.277 --> 08:27.877
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:27.946 --> 08:29.346
Not you!

08:29.414 --> 08:30.847
Yeah, I'm good.

08:30.915 --> 08:32.316
- Hi.
- Have we met before?

08:32.383 --> 08:34.683
Where's your snorkel,
surfer dude?

08:37.754 --> 08:40.289
The Gents?
You were called The Gents?

08:40.357 --> 08:42.825
Yep, that's George right there.
He's the drummer.

08:42.892 --> 08:45.627
The drummers always
die first.

08:46.628 --> 08:47.562
They do!

08:47.629 --> 08:48.830
John Rutsey from Rush,

08:48.897 --> 08:49.864
Keith Moon,

08:49.932 --> 08:51.532
John Bonham
from Led Zeppelin.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.001
My dad swears by it.

08:53.069 --> 08:54.135
Fine. Good.

08:54.403 --> 08:58.139
Anyway, that's Doug Walters.

08:58.207 --> 09:00.708
Everyone called him dogface,
and I don't know the reason,

09:00.776 --> 09:02.809
'cause he's a pretty
good looking guy.

09:02.877 --> 09:06.046
<i>Bobby Morrow,
terrific harmonica.</i>

09:06.113 --> 09:07.681
That's, uh, Eli Stark.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.949
<i>He was a decent bass player
if he wasn't drunk,</i>

09:10.017 --> 09:11.418
or punching somebody.

09:11.486 --> 09:12.486
Charming.

09:12.554 --> 09:14.421
You all look so young
and goofy.

09:14.489 --> 09:16.990
Well, I'll have you know,
we had to fight the girls off--

09:17.058 --> 09:18.224
even George,

09:18.292 --> 09:19.559
who was terrified
of the opposite sex,

09:19.626 --> 09:20.926
unless it was a horse.

09:22.829 --> 09:26.432
This picture was taken at
the last gig we ever played.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.167
We made a pact
we'd get together someday

09:28.235 --> 09:29.535
and have a reunion,
you know,

09:29.603 --> 09:31.504
and play one more set.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.239
<i>It never happened, though.</i>

09:34.307 --> 09:37.041
<i>I guess it never will now.</i>

09:38.444 --> 09:41.012
Oh yeah, Amy,
this guy's a real dream date.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.814
Okay,
it wasn't a date.

09:42.881 --> 09:44.216
He could barely even stagger
out of the bar.

09:44.283 --> 09:45.917
Lies... all lies.

09:45.984 --> 09:47.452
Not to mention that
fantastic nosedive

09:47.520 --> 09:48.720
you took into
the barn stall

09:48.787 --> 09:50.721
right before you threw up
and passed out.

09:50.788 --> 09:53.790
- That was real classy.
- Okay, uh, can we, uh...

09:53.858 --> 09:56.260
Can we please ch-change
the subject?

09:56.328 --> 09:58.262
I-I got a question,
um...

09:58.430 --> 09:59.963
How'd you manage
to stay up on this guy?

10:00.031 --> 10:01.665
I've learned.
I mean, he settles eventually,

10:01.733 --> 10:02.866
and I get a good ride
out of him,

10:02.934 --> 10:04.702
but it's a pain in the ass,
literally.

10:04.769 --> 10:06.236
So I've gotta get him
calmed down.

10:06.304 --> 10:07.603
Well, I'll try
a few things,

10:07.671 --> 10:08.805
but have you had him vetted?

10:08.872 --> 10:10.272
Yeah, he's totally fit.

10:10.341 --> 10:12.475
No problems with the saddle,
or his tack, or anything.

10:12.543 --> 10:13.943
Chase tried.
He swore he could fix him,

10:14.010 --> 10:15.378
but you know Chase.

10:15.446 --> 10:16.479
Yeah.

10:16.547 --> 10:17.880
Chase Powers.

10:17.948 --> 10:19.515
Like he could do anything
with this horse.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.484
And are you saying
you can?

10:21.552 --> 10:22.718
Oh yes I am!

10:22.785 --> 10:24.453
Really?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.020
That's what I do;
I ride broncs.

10:26.088 --> 10:28.223
That's the total opposite
of gentling them, right?

10:28.290 --> 10:29.624
All I'm saying is,
if you need someone

10:29.692 --> 10:31.493
to take the buck
out of this horse,

10:31.561 --> 10:32.794
I'm your man.

10:32.862 --> 10:35.029
Okay,
you two fight over it.

10:35.097 --> 10:37.566
My money's on this girl,
though.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.500
- See ya, Amy.
- See ya.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.372
Well, it sounds like you two had
a pretty interesting first date.

10:44.439 --> 10:46.440
It wasn't a date.

10:46.508 --> 10:48.342
She got me drunk
and took advantage of me.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.077
Oh, and I bet
you hated that.

10:50.144 --> 10:51.912
So much.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.647
You know what?
She's my client,

10:53.715 --> 10:55.648
so I'm gonna gentle
her horse...

10:55.716 --> 10:57.216
My way.

11:01.221 --> 11:04.023
So I have an
announcement to make.

11:04.091 --> 11:06.826
Lisa and I have a plan.

11:06.894 --> 11:08.762
We would like to throw
you a little birthday party.

11:08.829 --> 11:10.363
This weekend.

11:10.430 --> 11:11.897
Mm-hmm.

11:12.432 --> 11:14.600
Well, I think I told you, Lou,
I'm not interested.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.168
And it's my birthday,
so I guess I have a say.

11:17.236 --> 11:18.404
Just say yes!

11:18.471 --> 11:20.439
Come on,
it's gonna be fun.

11:20.507 --> 11:22.107
Fun...

11:22.174 --> 11:25.043
Well, I'm not in any mood
to discuss a birthday;

11:25.111 --> 11:28.479
I have a funeral
to go to tomorrow.

11:35.888 --> 11:38.122
<i>I'm a little worried
about grandpa.</i>

11:38.189 --> 11:39.557
Yeah,
I guess it'd be a shock,

11:39.625 --> 11:40.825
losing one of your friends
from the old days.

11:42.993 --> 11:47.196
Not so great right before
your birthday, huh?

11:47.264 --> 11:48.832
You know, I think Lou
should back off a bit.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.199
She won't.

11:50.267 --> 11:54.237
And teamed with Lisa,
he doesn't stand a chance.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.307
So who was your new client?

11:57.374 --> 11:58.808
Oh, do you remember
that girl

11:58.875 --> 12:01.109
from Caleb's luau night
disaster?

12:01.177 --> 12:03.078
The one that he said
was super mean?

12:03.146 --> 12:06.081
Yeah!
That's the one.

12:06.149 --> 12:07.416
Really?
She is super mean?

12:07.484 --> 12:09.485
No! She's not,
she's...

12:10.987 --> 12:12.621
She's really nice.

12:12.689 --> 12:15.857
She's one of those girls,
you know?

12:15.925 --> 12:17.525
No. What do you mean?

12:17.593 --> 12:19.727
Just one of those girls
who can...

12:19.795 --> 12:22.330
Wrap guys around
her little finger.

12:26.535 --> 12:28.603
Am I one of those girls?

12:31.172 --> 12:32.906
I know, I know.

12:32.974 --> 12:35.108
I just wish
I was more...

12:35.176 --> 12:37.511
Unpredictable
and fascinating,

12:37.579 --> 12:39.847
sarcastic...

12:39.914 --> 12:42.148
Even a little bit mean.

12:42.216 --> 12:43.550
Yeah.

12:44.418 --> 12:47.820
I bet I'd see more of you
if I was fascinating.

12:47.888 --> 12:49.522
I think you're nuts.

12:51.091 --> 12:54.426
Thanks, I'll take that
as a compliment.

12:58.098 --> 12:59.932
<i>What's he listening to?</i>

13:02.668 --> 13:04.569

13:29.027 --> 13:30.327
Hey!
Where's Jack?

13:30.395 --> 13:31.695
I got a date with him
and a hundred cows.

13:31.763 --> 13:33.631
Uh, he left first thing
for a funeral.

13:33.698 --> 13:35.197
Uh, Tuttle?

13:35.265 --> 13:36.499
George Tuttle.

13:36.567 --> 13:37.700
What? George who?

13:37.768 --> 13:38.935
Tuttle.

13:39.003 --> 13:40.269
He used to play in a band
with grandpa.

13:40.337 --> 13:41.771
Oh, way before my time.

13:41.839 --> 13:43.105
Oh, right,

13:43.173 --> 13:44.574
you're way too young
to remember that, right?

13:44.642 --> 13:47.176
Do you wanna go
to your grandpa?

13:48.546 --> 13:50.712
You, you're the grandpa,
right? Remember?

13:50.780 --> 13:52.681
Or are you too young
for that, too?

13:52.749 --> 13:53.749
There we go.

13:53.816 --> 13:55.717
Now, I need you onside.

13:55.785 --> 13:57.686
Lisa and I have a plan:

13:57.754 --> 13:59.821
We are gonna throw
a birthday party for grandpa,

13:59.889 --> 14:02.290
and I want you to help me
convince him it's a good idea.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.825
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

14:03.893 --> 14:05.894
I got... I got enough
on my plate than to

14:05.962 --> 14:07.127
spend my time trying to
talk Jack into something

14:07.195 --> 14:08.195
he doesn't want to do.

14:08.263 --> 14:09.897
You have too much
on your plate?

14:09.965 --> 14:10.898
Yeah!

14:10.966 --> 14:12.600
Uh...
Right. Here.

14:15.503 --> 14:17.838
You're a real natural,
gramps.

14:17.906 --> 14:19.206
Real natural.

14:29.583 --> 14:30.683
Jack?

14:32.786 --> 14:34.520
Jack Bartlett!

14:35.822 --> 14:37.457
How're you doin',
Jack?

14:37.524 --> 14:39.324
I-I'm good,
I'm... good.

14:39.392 --> 14:41.626
Too bad about
old George, eh?

14:41.694 --> 14:43.895
Yeah... yeah,
th-that's a shame.

14:43.963 --> 14:46.531
It's a--
it's a real shame.

14:46.599 --> 14:48.633
You don't recognize me,
do you?

14:48.701 --> 14:49.734
Eli Stark.

14:51.604 --> 14:54.339
Well, of course
I recognize you!

14:54.407 --> 14:56.340
I just never expected
to see you here, though.

14:56.408 --> 14:57.674
Why wouldn't I be here?

14:57.742 --> 14:58.976
Well,
'cause you and George...

14:59.044 --> 15:00.277
What about me
and George?

15:00.345 --> 15:01.345
Well, it's no secret

15:01.413 --> 15:02.746
you were on the outs
for years.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.215
Oh, hell!

15:04.983 --> 15:08.285
I've been on the outs
with everybody for years.

15:08.353 --> 15:09.686
Okay.

15:09.754 --> 15:11.821
But I've been doing
some backtracking.

15:11.889 --> 15:14.491
Never too late
to mend fences, right?

15:14.558 --> 15:16.259
So I...
I looked up old George.

15:16.327 --> 15:17.260
Really?

15:17.328 --> 15:18.561
Yeah.

15:18.629 --> 15:20.263
We spent a couple of days
together,

15:20.331 --> 15:21.831
drank some beers,
told some lies,

15:21.899 --> 15:22.965
and talked about old times.

15:23.034 --> 15:24.967
You know,
stuff like that.

15:25.036 --> 15:26.936
And then I'll be damned
if the son of a gun

15:27.004 --> 15:29.638
didn't up and drop dead
right in front of me!

15:29.705 --> 15:31.373
I'm tellin' you, Jack,
I...

15:31.441 --> 15:33.708
I think
I might be cursed.

15:33.776 --> 15:35.344
Every time I show up
on the scene,

15:35.412 --> 15:36.711
somebody dies.

15:36.779 --> 15:38.947
Remind me never to invite you
to my house.

15:39.015 --> 15:40.115
Well, it's a funny thing

15:40.183 --> 15:41.917
you should mention that,
Jack.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.458
<i>Caleb!</i>

15:51.260 --> 15:53.561
Caleb, I told you,
I will gentle Clover!

15:53.629 --> 15:55.797
I don't think there's
anything wrong with him.

15:56.365 --> 15:58.732
I can ride him just fine,
see?

15:59.834 --> 16:02.136
<i>Well, who knew?</i>

16:05.573 --> 16:06.439
Hah!

16:07.508 --> 16:09.076
Whoa! Ungh!

16:09.144 --> 16:10.678
Whoa! Whoa!

16:12.113 --> 16:13.213
Ungh!

16:15.649 --> 16:16.582
<i>Hmm, he's not bad!</i>

16:16.650 --> 16:17.817
<i>He's an idiot.</i>

16:17.885 --> 16:18.818
<i>Well, he's staying on.</i>

16:18.886 --> 16:20.787
<i>Come on! Agh!</i>

16:21.354 --> 16:22.488
Oof!

16:25.525 --> 16:26.659
Nice work, cowboy!

16:26.726 --> 16:28.327
Still at square one!

16:28.395 --> 16:30.095
Might have to put Chase
back on the job.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.196
<i>You know what?</i>

16:31.263 --> 16:32.863
You know so much
about horses,

16:32.931 --> 16:33.699
gentle him yourself!

16:33.766 --> 16:34.900
Anybody ever tell you

16:34.967 --> 16:36.768
you're kinda cute
when you're angry?

16:36.836 --> 16:38.670
<i>Amy!</i>

16:38.738 --> 16:41.206
I need to talk to you,
come in the house!

16:41.773 --> 16:43.308
I've had the best idea!

16:52.093 --> 16:54.061
So you wanna find
all the old band members

16:54.062 --> 16:55.863
and get them together
for grandpa's birthday?

16:55.931 --> 16:57.565
Yes, that is exactly
what we want to do!

16:57.633 --> 16:59.100
I think
it's a fabulous idea!

16:59.167 --> 17:00.735
<i>So do I.</i>

17:00.802 --> 17:02.370
Jack's no spring chicken,
Amy.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.971
The guy who died
was younger than he is.

17:04.039 --> 17:05.707
Whoa!
Can we all just stop?

17:05.773 --> 17:07.040
Okay, we don't have time
for a debate.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.443
If we wanna have the party
this weekend,

17:08.510 --> 17:09.909
- we need to start planning.
- We do.

17:09.977 --> 17:11.377
He doesn't like a fuss!
You know that, Lou!

17:11.445 --> 17:12.878
<i>It's a bad idea!</i>

17:12.946 --> 17:14.615
Amy,
they made a pact.

17:14.682 --> 17:16.015
They said they would
get the band together

17:16.083 --> 17:17.150
one more time

17:17.218 --> 17:18.352
and we can make that
happen

17:18.419 --> 17:20.354
before... it's too late.

17:20.421 --> 17:22.922
Okay. Well, obviously,
you've already decided.

17:22.990 --> 17:24.558
Amy, come on,
what is your problem?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.157
I mean, be spontaneous!

17:26.226 --> 17:27.925
<i>Don't you have any sense
of adventure?</i>

17:27.993 --> 17:29.995
You have to grab life
by the horns and live it,

17:30.063 --> 17:31.397
before it's too late.

17:31.465 --> 17:33.532
Oh! That's me.

17:34.434 --> 17:35.801
Lou's right.

17:35.869 --> 17:37.236
If you want something done,
you have to just do it!

17:37.304 --> 17:39.838
So chill
why don't you?

17:41.474 --> 17:42.741
It's just a party.

17:45.978 --> 17:48.045
Grandpa's just gonna hate this.

17:48.113 --> 17:49.381
Well, maybe.

17:49.448 --> 17:51.616
Maybe? Like you think
I'm wrong, or...?

17:51.684 --> 17:54.118
No, it's just, you know,
maybe it'd be good for him

17:54.186 --> 17:55.520
to spend some time
with old friends, and...

17:55.588 --> 17:57.488
<i>-Easy!</i>

17:57.555 --> 17:59.390
Whoa!

17:59.457 --> 18:00.624
Whoa!

18:01.693 --> 18:03.193
Agghhhhh!

18:03.261 --> 18:04.828
Hey, hold on!

18:04.896 --> 18:06.597
<i>She's awesome!</i>

18:08.333 --> 18:10.233
<i>Come on!</i>

18:10.302 --> 18:12.869
<i>Hey, Caleb, you got yourself
some competition here!</i>

18:12.937 --> 18:14.771
<i>Good for you!</i>

18:14.838 --> 18:15.838
Woo!

18:15.906 --> 18:17.774
Yeah, yeah,
good for me.

18:17.841 --> 18:19.208
Not good for my butt.

18:19.276 --> 18:20.943
I know I haven't made
much progress,

18:21.011 --> 18:23.579
but I'm gonna need a few days
before you'll see a difference.

18:23.647 --> 18:25.315
I swear you could last
the whole eight seconds!

18:25.382 --> 18:26.516
You could be a pro.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.950
Yeah, you're full of it.

18:28.018 --> 18:29.285
No, I'm serious,
there's not too many girls

18:29.352 --> 18:30.585
who can ride broncs.

18:30.653 --> 18:33.188
Yeah, 'cause girls
aren't insane!

18:33.255 --> 18:35.424
You on the circuit,
you could win big!

18:35.491 --> 18:37.826
- It'd be crazy, right, Ty?
- Pretty awesome.

18:37.893 --> 18:39.561
I can teach you.

18:39.629 --> 18:41.763
I think there's not much
that you could teach me.

18:41.831 --> 18:43.264
Here. I gotta go.

18:48.337 --> 18:50.103
She's trouble.

18:51.039 --> 18:52.606
Yes, she is.

18:54.810 --> 18:57.645
Do you really think
that I'm not spontaneous?

18:57.713 --> 19:00.981
Well, you're a lot more serious
than I was at your age.

19:01.049 --> 19:02.716
Maybe I do worry
too much.

19:02.783 --> 19:04.484
I just...
I don't know,

19:04.552 --> 19:06.453
maybe grandpa will like
this party.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.254
In other words,
maybe I'm right?

19:08.322 --> 19:09.389
I didn't go that far.

19:09.457 --> 19:11.157
I just want him
to be happy!

19:11.225 --> 19:12.492
So do I,

19:12.560 --> 19:13.693
and I think one way
for him to be happy

19:13.761 --> 19:15.495
is going to be to bring
his friends together--

19:15.563 --> 19:16.830
old and new.

19:16.897 --> 19:17.830
I guess.

19:19.932 --> 19:21.667
Uh, Amy, and Lou.

19:22.602 --> 19:23.902
Eli Stark.

19:26.906 --> 19:28.340
Can I see that?

19:28.408 --> 19:29.441
Yeah, sure.

19:29.509 --> 19:30.676
I really wanna get
one of these.

19:30.744 --> 19:31.977
They are pretty cool.

19:32.044 --> 19:34.111
So how do you put
a number in here?

19:34.179 --> 19:36.080
Easy, just here.

19:37.082 --> 19:39.684
Um... this is my cell,

19:39.752 --> 19:42.353
<i>just in case you want advice
on how to get fired.</i>

19:42.421 --> 19:45.089
It's much cooler
than quitting.

19:48.159 --> 19:50.560
Well, I'd like to raise
a glass to George Tuttle.

19:50.628 --> 19:52.462
He was an excellent
bronc rider,

19:52.530 --> 19:54.264
and a passable drummer,

19:54.331 --> 19:56.500
but, uh,
he went before his time.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.870
Well, when your time
comes, your time comes.

19:59.937 --> 20:00.871
To George.

20:00.938 --> 20:01.938
To George.

20:12.616 --> 20:13.682
Ah!

20:15.852 --> 20:17.219
Oh, sorry,

20:17.287 --> 20:18.621
you'll have to excuse
my bad table manners.

20:18.688 --> 20:21.423
I'm not a very
sociable guy,

20:21.490 --> 20:22.791
like Jack here.

20:23.726 --> 20:24.959
Of course,
he wasn't always this tame.

20:25.027 --> 20:26.461
I could tell you
some stories

20:26.529 --> 20:27.995
that would curl your hair.

20:28.063 --> 20:29.430
<i>One night in Grand Prairie,
in particular.</i>

20:29.431 --> 20:30.431
Oh no.

20:30.432 --> 20:31.800
I'd like to hear
that story.

20:33.168 --> 20:34.436
Where do you live now,
Eli?

20:34.503 --> 20:36.805
I got a small ranch
up near Jasper,

20:37.072 --> 20:38.404
God's country.

20:38.472 --> 20:39.740
I live alone.

20:39.807 --> 20:41.274
Clara passed on
some ten years ago now.

20:41.342 --> 20:42.709
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:42.777 --> 20:44.144
Well, I don't think
you ever met her.

20:44.211 --> 20:45.746
She was my fourth wife.

20:46.681 --> 20:49.883
But I can certainly see
what's keepin' Jack so young,

20:49.951 --> 20:51.551
<i>even at his advanced age.</i>

20:52.453 --> 20:54.486
Advanced age!

20:54.554 --> 20:57.089
So what made you wanna look
up all your old, old friends?

20:57.157 --> 21:00.159
That's a good question,
young lady.

21:04.031 --> 21:04.964
More wine?

21:05.032 --> 21:06.598
That's a beautiful idea!

21:11.336 --> 21:13.138
Lou, I'm sorry...

21:14.073 --> 21:16.174
About springing this guy
on you.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.376
He attached himself to me
like a burr,

21:18.443 --> 21:20.511
said Heartland was on
his way back home,

21:20.579 --> 21:21.913
that he wanted
to catch up.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.114
I mean,
what could I do?

21:23.182 --> 21:24.382
Grandpa, it's fine!

21:24.449 --> 21:26.650
I mean, isn't it nice
to see an old friend?

21:26.718 --> 21:29.086
Old friends are good,
right?

21:29.154 --> 21:30.520
Oh yeah, Jack.

21:31.522 --> 21:33.724
At your age, you're lucky
to have any friends left.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.127
<i>You know,
when you think about it,</i>

21:37.195 --> 21:39.797
this party's probably
a really good idea, right?

21:39.864 --> 21:41.764
Before the sands of time...

21:41.832 --> 21:43.532
drift through the hourglass.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.602
Trere's not gonna be
a party.

21:48.739 --> 21:49.839
Good one, dad!

21:49.907 --> 21:50.907
What?

21:52.009 --> 21:53.342
What?

21:53.410 --> 21:55.311
Eli is here.
I mean, how perfect is that?

21:55.378 --> 21:56.345
It's a sign!

21:56.413 --> 21:58.080
A sign?

21:58.147 --> 22:00.115
Yes, a sign that I
absolutely have to do this now!

22:00.183 --> 22:03.985
I have to get the rest
of the group together!

22:05.755 --> 22:06.788
Here we are.

22:10.559 --> 22:11.626
Whoa!

22:12.729 --> 22:13.828
Well, I can't sleep
in here,

22:13.895 --> 22:15.129
this is too damn clean!

22:16.898 --> 22:19.466
You just make
yourself at home.

22:21.803 --> 22:23.904
Now, you're staying
the weekend, right?

22:23.972 --> 22:25.239
The weekend? No!

22:25.306 --> 22:27.108
Oh, but you have to!

22:27.175 --> 22:28.642
It's grandpa's birthday
on Saturday,

22:28.710 --> 22:30.409
and it would be really great
if you could be here.

22:30.477 --> 22:32.311
Well, thank you,
but uh...

22:32.379 --> 22:34.147
Please, Eli.

22:34.215 --> 22:36.349
It-it would mean
a lot to him,

22:36.416 --> 22:38.251
and to me.

22:38.318 --> 22:39.753
Well...

22:39.820 --> 22:42.021
But all I got to wear
is this here funeral suit,

22:42.089 --> 22:44.624
and I don't think that's
appropriate for a party.

22:44.691 --> 22:46.424
Don't worry about it,
I can fix you up.

22:46.492 --> 22:48.026
You can fix me up.

22:48.094 --> 22:49.228
Yeah!

22:49.295 --> 22:51.496
I'm gonna be your
Eliza Doolittle, am I?

22:51.564 --> 22:54.099
Yes, you'll be
my Eliza Doolittle.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.068
And you have
a good sleep.

22:56.136 --> 22:58.637
Oh, and there was
one more thing.

22:58.704 --> 22:59.905
Do you think
you could look up

22:59.973 --> 23:02.106
Doug Walters
and Bobby Morrow for me?

23:02.174 --> 23:03.074
Why?

23:03.142 --> 23:04.375
Well, it would g great

23:04.442 --> 23:05.609
if they could be
at the party too.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.479
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

23:08.546 --> 23:09.747
Does Jack know?

23:09.815 --> 23:11.048
Not yet.

23:11.116 --> 23:12.784
Oh, a surprise, huh?

23:14.753 --> 23:16.020
Surprises can kill a man.

23:16.088 --> 23:18.088
You do know that,
don't you?

23:18.990 --> 23:20.390
Good night, Eli.

23:57.833 --> 23:59.134
You have got
to be kidding me.

24:01.102 --> 24:03.736
Well, I mean,
this is the first step.

24:03.804 --> 24:05.605
Like it's no big deal
that you can ride Clover.

24:05.672 --> 24:07.306
I mean,
you're used to him.

24:07.374 --> 24:09.409
But no two broncs
are ever the same.

24:09.476 --> 24:11.143
The animal you ride
in the arena,

24:11.211 --> 24:12.378
now, that's the luck
of the draw.

24:12.446 --> 24:14.480
You wasted your money
on this thing.

24:14.548 --> 24:16.516
Yeah, I wouldn't waste
a dime on you.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.149
A buddy of mine
lent it to me.

24:18.217 --> 24:19.684
I never said I'd let you
teach me to ride.

24:19.752 --> 24:21.085
Ah well,

24:21.153 --> 24:23.087
very few women can say no
to Caleb Odell.

24:23.155 --> 24:24.456
Mm-hmm.

24:25.157 --> 24:28.026
So, you ready to learn
the ropes, or what?

24:28.093 --> 24:29.994
Or hey,
maybe you're scared?

24:30.062 --> 24:31.262
That's okay,

24:31.330 --> 24:33.931
it's perfectly normal
to be afraid...

24:33.998 --> 24:35.032
I guess.

24:37.903 --> 24:39.470
Woo! Wooo!

24:41.740 --> 24:43.273
Yeah!
You're doin' a good job!

24:43.341 --> 24:44.274
Okay! Oh!

24:47.512 --> 24:49.212
Whoa! Oof!

24:52.215 --> 24:53.583
Oh my God, that
was totally awesome!

24:53.651 --> 24:54.851
Do you wanna go again?

24:54.919 --> 24:57.787
Woo! Well, let me catch
my breath first.

24:57.855 --> 24:59.288
What do you say,
any takers?

24:59.356 --> 25:00.323
<i>Huh?</i>

25:00.390 --> 25:01.324
All right, I'm in!

25:01.391 --> 25:02.792
What do you wanna do?

25:02.860 --> 25:04.794
You wanna relive your 3 seconds
of <i>rodeo glory?</i>

25:04.862 --> 25:06.094
Why don't you turn that
up to ten?

25:06.162 --> 25:07.663
You're a madman, Ty!

25:09.866 --> 25:10.933
All right, you ready?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.334
<i>I am. Here we go!</i>

25:15.872 --> 25:17.506
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

25:17.574 --> 25:19.007
<i>Yeah, buddy!</i>

25:19.075 --> 25:20.008
Oh...

25:20.076 --> 25:21.943
<i>Oh no! </i>

that sounds good to me!

25:36.925 --> 25:39.058
You know, you're not
a very good liar.

25:39.126 --> 25:41.628
You! I remember the day
we recorded this,

25:41.696 --> 25:44.364
and George was so nervous
he lost his lunch.

25:44.431 --> 25:45.832
Yeah, then you,

25:45.900 --> 25:47.734
you got drunk as a skunk
that night,

25:47.802 --> 25:49.369
and you paid the bartender
at the Winchester

25:49.436 --> 25:51.170
to let us play a set.

25:51.238 --> 25:53.006
<i>And he did!</i>

25:53.073 --> 25:54.974
And then you and dogface
got into a fight

25:55.041 --> 25:56.375
over who played better,

25:56.442 --> 25:57.943
and you broke
his damn nose!

25:59.245 --> 26:00.846
No! You broke a guy's nose?

26:02.148 --> 26:03.816
Well, I uh...

26:03.884 --> 26:05.618
Hey, Jack had a real short fuse,
and when he lost it,

26:05.685 --> 26:07.786
he could be a mean, tough,
son of a bitch!

26:07.854 --> 26:09.554
Oh,
I don't believe you!

26:09.622 --> 26:11.255
Oh, believe it!

26:14.359 --> 26:16.394
Oh, gee,
listen to that.

26:26.571 --> 26:27.704
Good boy.

26:30.508 --> 26:31.575
Pick it up.

26:34.779 --> 26:35.846
Pick it up.

26:38.950 --> 26:40.050
Hold.

26:41.118 --> 26:42.117
Good boy.

26:43.620 --> 26:44.720
Thank you.

26:49.593 --> 26:50.660
Good boy.

27:04.773 --> 27:06.741
So, grandpa,
you'll never guess!

27:06.809 --> 27:08.376
But thanks to Eli here,

27:08.444 --> 27:09.477
we were able to get in touch

27:09.545 --> 27:11.345
with Doug Walters
and Bobby Morrow,

27:11.413 --> 27:14.748
<i>and they're both able
to make it for your birthday!</i>

27:14.816 --> 27:16.483
<i>You're gonna love this!</i>

27:16.551 --> 27:19.286
They're bringing
their instruments.

27:19.353 --> 27:21.789
So that reunion gig
you always wanted to play,

27:21.856 --> 27:23.691
it's gonna happen!

27:23.758 --> 27:25.258
We're gonna have some friends
and neighbours to join us,

27:25.326 --> 27:26.594
and it's a go!

27:30.197 --> 27:33.499
I told you
I did not want a party!

27:33.567 --> 27:36.535
I don't know how many damn times
I have to say that!

27:36.604 --> 27:38.571
So you listen to me now!

27:38.639 --> 27:40.372
There will be no party!

27:41.208 --> 27:43.442
There will not be a party.

27:57.690 --> 27:59.224
Well, Jack...

28:01.194 --> 28:02.492
That was almost
like old times.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.194
I... I didn't know
whether to duck

28:04.262 --> 28:05.029
or run for cover.

28:10.535 --> 28:12.502
Jack...

28:12.570 --> 28:16.206
You remember the night before
you and Lindy got married?

28:16.274 --> 28:18.607
You were all set to bolt.

28:18.675 --> 28:20.310
You were that close
to jumpin' in your truck

28:20.377 --> 28:21.510
and gettin' as far away

28:21.578 --> 28:24.647
from that little log church
as you could.

28:24.714 --> 28:26.282
And then remember,
you and I sat down

28:26.350 --> 28:27.951
and, uh, had a few drinks--

28:28.018 --> 28:31.154
<i>well, more than a few,
actually--</i>

28:31.221 --> 28:32.755
and I told you
you were never gonna meet

28:32.823 --> 28:34.957
another woman like that.

28:34.991 --> 28:36.624
You were never gonna find
another girl

28:36.692 --> 28:37.993
who was as pretty
as she was,

28:38.061 --> 28:39.461
and as smart as she was,

28:39.528 --> 28:41.129
and as talented.

28:41.197 --> 28:42.931
And more to the point,

28:42.999 --> 28:45.400
one who would put up with
a son of a bitch like you.

28:46.869 --> 28:50.438
<i>And do you recall
what you said?</i>

28:50.505 --> 28:51.772
Right. Nothing.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.506
You got mad
and I had to run for cover.

28:52.574 --> 28:54.875
But you stayed,

28:54.943 --> 28:56.210
and the next morning
you married that girl,

28:56.278 --> 28:57.744
and, Jack,

28:57.812 --> 29:00.147
that's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

29:00.215 --> 29:02.016
<i>I swear the best part
of the man you are today,</i>

29:02.084 --> 29:04.285
<i>you owe to that woman.</i>

29:04.353 --> 29:05.486
They say people don't change,

29:05.553 --> 29:08.455
but... she changed you,
Jack.

29:09.857 --> 29:10.790
You're wrong.

29:10.858 --> 29:12.359
The hell I'm wrong!

29:12.426 --> 29:13.326
It wasn't the night
before the wedding,

29:13.394 --> 29:15.561
it was the whole week before.

29:16.497 --> 29:17.597
Well, whatever.

29:18.565 --> 29:21.034
The point was that...

29:21.102 --> 29:23.202
You know, you were always more
than willing to run away

29:23.269 --> 29:25.770
from anything that
might be good for you

29:25.838 --> 29:26.771
apparently,
you still are.

29:26.839 --> 29:27.973
Hell, Jack,

29:28.041 --> 29:29.941
all they wanna do
is throw you a party.

29:30.010 --> 29:32.478
What's wrong with that?

29:33.713 --> 29:37.449
You know, the night
before my wedding,

29:37.517 --> 29:39.583
I was scared.

29:39.651 --> 29:41.552
Scared to death.

29:44.023 --> 29:46.391
And I'm scared now,
Eli.

29:46.458 --> 29:48.092
I remember
all of you guys--

29:48.160 --> 29:50.995
George, and Doug,
and Bobby--

29:51.063 --> 29:52.530
and I think of us
like we're still twenty,

29:52.597 --> 29:54.797
but dammit, we're not!

29:54.865 --> 29:56.500
They're old, we're old,

29:56.567 --> 29:59.002
and...
and George is dead.

29:59.970 --> 30:02.139
I don't know where
the time's gone.

30:02.206 --> 30:03.907
Well... time sure flies

30:03.974 --> 30:05.575
when you're having such
a goddamn good time,

30:05.643 --> 30:07.110
doesn't it?

30:09.180 --> 30:12.081
Listen, Jack,
you're a lucky man!

30:12.149 --> 30:14.050
You've got your health,

30:14.117 --> 30:16.052
you've got
an amazing family.

30:16.119 --> 30:17.786
You got a hot girlfriend,
for God sakes!

30:17.854 --> 30:19.355
What're you gonna do?

30:19.423 --> 30:20.856
Close up the bar
before last call

30:20.924 --> 30:22.158
because you imagine
you're on the edge

30:22.225 --> 30:24.760
of some slippery slope?

30:24.827 --> 30:26.261
Now don't go there,
Jack.

30:26.328 --> 30:27.962
Believe me,

30:28.030 --> 30:30.932
the slippery slope
will come soon enough.

30:30.999 --> 30:32.434
Besides,

30:32.501 --> 30:34.035
you do get to thinkin'
more seriously

30:34.103 --> 30:35.470
about the passage of time,

30:35.538 --> 30:38.339
especially when you get
to be our age.

30:38.407 --> 30:39.941
What're you talking about,
"our age"?

30:40.008 --> 30:41.409
You're way older
than me.

30:41.477 --> 30:42.976
- The hell I am!
- Yes, you are!

30:43.044 --> 30:45.245
- I am not!
- Well, you look like hell.

30:45.313 --> 30:47.581
Yeah,
I feel like hell, too.

30:48.516 --> 30:51.418
But then,
I'm not surprised.

30:53.054 --> 30:55.722
Yeah,
I got cancer, Jack.

30:58.992 --> 31:00.126
When did you find out?

31:00.194 --> 31:01.894
About a month ago.

31:01.962 --> 31:03.463
What're you gonna do?

31:03.530 --> 31:04.564
Nothing.

31:04.631 --> 31:06.031
I ain't gonna look
for treatment.

31:06.099 --> 31:07.399
Those people'll kill you
ten different ways

31:07.467 --> 31:09.134
with the poison
they give you,

31:09.202 --> 31:10.602
and I only wanna die
the one time,

31:10.669 --> 31:12.870
thank you very much.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.139
And I-I'd appreciate it,
Jack,

31:14.207 --> 31:15.773
if you didn't mention this
to anybody else

31:15.841 --> 31:17.509
because people
just get really weird

31:17.577 --> 31:20.011
around the "c" word.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.315
It's gettin' late.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.751
Yep, still tickin'.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.886
Heh! Tickin' away.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.859
Well, I-I'm gonna turn in,
Jack.

31:35.927 --> 31:37.961
Yeah, sure.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.263
Hey, Jack?

31:41.765 --> 31:43.600
Thank you.

31:43.667 --> 31:46.769
It was really good
seeing you again.

31:58.981 --> 32:00.649
Hi.

32:00.717 --> 32:02.784
Lou went to bed.

32:02.852 --> 32:04.219
I'm sorry.

32:04.286 --> 32:06.221
Lou's really sorry.

32:06.288 --> 32:07.622
Don't.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.190
I feel terrible.

32:09.258 --> 32:10.991
We really did think it was
gonna be such a good idea,

32:11.059 --> 32:12.426
and we should've
listened to you.

32:12.494 --> 32:13.927
Now, stop!

32:15.230 --> 32:16.630
It's okay.

32:19.267 --> 32:21.836
It's a really good idea.

32:24.005 --> 32:26.306
The party,
it's a really good idea.

32:26.374 --> 32:27.407
What?

32:28.843 --> 32:30.844
I'm the one
who's apologizing,

32:30.911 --> 32:33.346
I overreacted and...

32:35.850 --> 32:36.783
I'm sorry.

32:36.851 --> 32:38.752
Awww!

32:38.819 --> 32:39.853
Oh, good!

32:51.311 --> 32:53.579
Mallory, they'll
be covered in grass!

32:53.646 --> 32:57.215
This text, it's Austin.
The Austin!

32:57.249 --> 32:59.617
He heard about the party
and wants to come.

32:59.685 --> 33:01.185
Should I invite him?

33:01.253 --> 33:02.286
Can I invite him?

33:02.354 --> 33:03.354
Please tell me
I can invite him!

33:03.422 --> 33:04.888
Invite him!

33:09.761 --> 33:11.962
Well, well, don't
you look handsome!

33:12.030 --> 33:13.463
Well, thank you,
ma'am.

33:13.531 --> 33:15.198
You're not lookin'
so bad yourself.

33:15.266 --> 33:17.300
So she cleaned you up,
did she?

33:17.368 --> 33:18.868
Yeah,
she cleaned me up.

33:18.936 --> 33:20.770
I looked in the mirror
and I scared myself.

33:22.607 --> 33:23.673
Ooh!

33:23.741 --> 33:25.007
Would you look
what's coming here?

33:25.075 --> 33:26.710

Good to see you!

33:32.215 --> 33:34.182
<i>Dogface,

33:34.251 --> 33:35.451
What the hell happened
to you?

33:35.518 --> 33:36.852
You used to be handsome!

33:36.919 --> 33:38.754
Well I see you're still
as ugly as ever!

33:40.957 --> 33:43.692
Jack, my nose is still
right where you left it!

33:43.760 --> 33:45.693
Well, I'm glad you're still
laughing about it!

33:47.963 --> 33:49.029
Hi.

33:49.097 --> 33:50.598
