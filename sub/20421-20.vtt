00:06.540 --> 00:10.260
<i>Minori has never asked for my help.</i>

00:11.330 --> 00:14.310
<i>She's asked for advice or for teaching,</i>

00:14.800 --> 00:15.650
<i>but...</i>

00:16.490 --> 00:19.100
<i>She has never asked me to help her.</i>

00:20.830 --> 00:22.060
<i>And now...</i>

00:22.600 --> 00:25.060
Help us, please...

00:25.830 --> 00:27.230
We have a casualty.

00:27.580 --> 00:29.220
It's Rundel Haus.

00:30.370 --> 00:31.600
He is

00:32.330 --> 00:33.550
one of the People of the Land.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.170
Call Karashin!

02:07.390 --> 02:09.010
He'll be in charge here for a while.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.690
<i>There are things even I can't do.</i>

02:16.510 --> 02:19.550
<i>No... In this irrational world,</i>

02:19.550 --> 02:21.530
<i>there aren't many things I </i>can<i> do.</i>

02:22.750 --> 02:23.590
<i>But...</i>

02:26.860 --> 02:28.760
<i>If Minori needs my help...</i>

02:29.980 --> 02:35.950
<b>Contract</b>

02:32.240 --> 02:33.320
Contract.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.190
Tell me the situation.

02:40.130 --> 02:44.450
Rundel Haus was fatally wounded 
during the defense of Choushi.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.060
We've cast two revival spells, but they failed.

02:48.470 --> 02:51.660
However, he has a pulse, and he's still warm.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.460
But he isn't waking up.

02:54.660 --> 02:57.090
Where are you, and who is with you?

02:57.330 --> 03:01.330
It's Tohya, Isuzu, Serara, and me.

03:01.330 --> 03:02.950
And Rundel Haus.

03:03.490 --> 03:07.100
We're near the crossroads, 
at the center of Choushi!

03:07.780 --> 03:09.100
Is it safe?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.160
There are no enemies in the vicinity.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.860
But near the coast, there's still fighting going on.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.930
We don't know when the goblins will attack...

03:17.930 --> 03:21.450
Shiroe, save Rudy!

03:21.450 --> 03:23.910
I was the one who brought him here...

03:24.430 --> 03:27.100
I... It's my fault...

03:28.050 --> 03:30.190
Please, Shiroe!

03:31.570 --> 03:34.690
Tell Serara to cast a revival spell.

03:34.690 --> 03:35.380
Right.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.380
Stand by for 150 seconds.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.130
Tohya is to watch for enemies.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.980
Isuzu should use an MP-restoration song.

03:42.510 --> 03:45.680
After 150 seconds, you cast a revival spell.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.520
Okay.

03:47.490 --> 03:51.390
<i>The mystical energy that animates humans 
and demi-humans is called the "spirit."</i>

03:51.190 --> 03:55.890
<b>Psyche</b>

03:52.450 --> 03:54.810
<i>Psyche is the energy that animates the mind.</i>

03:54.810 --> 03:56.440
<i>It affects things such as magic, as well.</i>

03:56.260 --> 03:59.390
<b>Psyche = Magic Points</b>

03:56.900 --> 03:59.400
<i>It is also called MP, magic points.</i>

03:59.400 --> 04:02.740
<b>Anima</b>

04:00.520 --> 04:02.890
Anima is the energy that animates the body.

04:02.760 --> 04:08.900
<b>Anima = Hit Points</b>

04:03.380 --> 04:05.600
HP... Hit points.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.910
It is also the energy known as "ki."

04:09.560 --> 04:13.420
<i>When someone is defeated in battle, 
the psyche and anima are split,</i>

04:13.790 --> 04:16.580
<i>and the flow of information from 
body to mind is severed.</i>

04:18.270 --> 04:20.620
<i>Then, the anima-dispersal begins.</i>

04:21.580 --> 04:26.080
<i>Anima-dispersal is when the anima, 
the body, is dispersed and vanishes.</i>

04:26.840 --> 04:30.430
<i>Revival magic gathers the anima dispersed 
into the surrounding atmosphere,</i>

04:30.430 --> 04:32.350
<i>and reconstructs it.</i>

04:33.480 --> 04:35.150
<i>Regan hypothesized that</i>

04:35.150 --> 04:38.660
<i>revival magic would work on People of the 
Land, if used immediately after death.</i>

04:39.540 --> 04:44.250
<i>If it's strengthening his pulse, 
his body was successfully restored.</i>

04:45.240 --> 04:47.660
<i>But if he hasn't woken up,</i>

04:48.390 --> 04:52.920
<i>his psyche, the energy that powers his mind, 
has begun to disperse, as well.</i>

04:54.260 --> 04:57.670
<i>When the body disperses, so does the mind.</i>

04:58.860 --> 05:01.860
<i>And when the body is completely gone,</i>

05:01.860 --> 05:05.450
<i>the mind has nowhere to return, 
making revival impossible.</i>

05:06.280 --> 05:08.570
<i>At this point, People of the Land die.</i>

05:09.760 --> 05:14.150
<i>An adventurer's body is automatically 
restored at the Cathedral,</i>

05:14.150 --> 05:18.190
<i>and the psyche, or mind, 
is connected to it, so they revive.</i>

05:19.470 --> 05:21.310
150 seconds have passed.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.340
I'm casting a revival spell.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.230
In another 150 seconds, use Serara's again.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.710
I'm on my way now.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.650
Keep alternating for another eight minutes.

05:31.650 --> 05:32.460
Okay.

05:33.110 --> 05:36.440
<i>Right now, all we can do is to stop 
the body from being destroyed...</i>

05:37.290 --> 05:39.390
<i>But then what?</i>

05:39.730 --> 05:42.470
Isn't it your job to think, Shiro?

05:44.530 --> 05:45.470
But...

05:45.930 --> 05:49.910
That doesn't mean I can just take you 
to see the midnight sun in Icelandâ€”

05:49.910 --> 05:52.730
But I want to see it...

05:53.580 --> 05:55.350
I'm a dreamer.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.730
And you make my dreams come true.

05:57.730 --> 05:58.700
Right?

05:59.180 --> 06:01.420
But still...

06:02.720 --> 06:08.290
I specialize in the study of world-class magic.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.810
Magic that alters the rules of the world...

06:14.800 --> 06:16.460
Akatsuki, take the reins!

06:39.630 --> 06:40.540
Milord...

06:42.140 --> 06:43.970
I've brought the report.

06:44.870 --> 06:45.790
Thank you.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.670
What am I...

06:53.870 --> 06:55.760
How goes the battle?

06:57.480 --> 07:00.760
You seem to have grown quite popular.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.180
She looked at me!

07:02.540 --> 07:05.170
Northerner girls are total angels!

07:03.180 --> 07:05.170
Gotta take a picture... Wait, I can't...

07:05.170 --> 07:06.310
So cute!

07:09.240 --> 07:10.690
Dire wolves.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.010
Probably the huge race.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.740
The Goblin King?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.960
He won't leave Seventh Fall.

07:19.490 --> 07:22.600
Most likely, it's the Goblin General's forces.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.860
Oh...

07:26.510 --> 07:28.780
We can clean up their nest later.

07:29.250 --> 07:33.870
For now, let's murder every single 
one of the bastards in Zantleaf.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.930
<i>I don't know if I can really do it.</i>

07:41.570 --> 07:44.000
<i>And even if it does work...</i>

07:44.600 --> 07:45.440
That'll do.

07:45.850 --> 07:46.710
Thanks, Akatsuki.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.080
What's wrong?

07:51.530 --> 07:53.970
The Ocypete has reached Choushi.

07:54.450 --> 07:57.890
But the sahuagin are making landing difficult.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.000
They've begun combat!

08:01.140 --> 08:03.900
Everyone! Reinforcements are here!

08:04.410 --> 08:07.900
Just a bit more! Just hang on a bit more!

08:08.690 --> 08:10.910
Akatsuki, watch our surroundings.

08:10.910 --> 08:11.900
Roger.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.720
Move everyone away from here.

08:16.090 --> 08:19.450
Don't let anyone near, players or monsters!

08:19.450 --> 08:20.420
Leave it to me.

08:30.150 --> 08:31.150
Shiroe...

08:31.150 --> 08:32.310
Shiroe!

08:33.850 --> 08:34.680
Is this him?

08:35.150 --> 08:36.080
Yes.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.930
This is Rundel Haus.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.820
Minori, add me to your party.

08:44.820 --> 08:45.640
Okay.

08:46.290 --> 08:47.480
You're Isuzu, right?

08:47.830 --> 08:50.560
Keep casting Meditation Nocturne.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.990
R-Right.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.400
I'm going to use a new magic spell.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.310
Tell no one about this.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.370
A new magic spell?

08:59.860 --> 09:03.630
If you can't agree to that, either give up or leave.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.260
All right...

09:09.910 --> 09:10.830
Let's get started.

09:11.320 --> 09:22.020
<b>Skills > Shiroe</b>

09:12.260 --> 09:22.020
<b>Undo
Over-runner
Mana-channeling</b>

09:12.790 --> 09:14.150
Mana-channeling.

09:14.690 --> 09:16.270
What is that?

09:16.660 --> 09:22.020
It's an enchanter's skill that absorbs MP from 
all party members and returns it equally.

09:22.780 --> 09:24.520
But why?

09:28.020 --> 09:32.280
<b>Tohya                                 Minori                     Isuzu</b>

09:28.020 --> 09:32.280
<b>Serara                               Shiroe                       Rundel Haus Code</b>

09:33.090 --> 09:35.160
<i>Psyche is the vessel of the mind,</i>

09:35.160 --> 09:37.780
<i>and it is also MP...</i>

09:38.220 --> 09:39.050
<i>Meaning...</i>

09:43.460 --> 09:46.210
<b>Rundel Haus Code</b>

09:51.010 --> 09:52.260
Minori, use a revival spell.

09:52.610 --> 09:53.960
Serara, continuous healing.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.240
Okay!

09:56.320 --> 10:01.160
<i>Rundel Haus's MP, his mind, is now 
active, but he's still unconscious.</i>

10:01.590 --> 10:04.270
<i>So the link between anima and psyche,</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:06.840
<i>his body and mind, is still cut.</i>

10:08.760 --> 10:10.700
Now it's a race against time.

10:12.530 --> 10:14.220
Revival Incense...

10:15.610 --> 10:20.130
This will turn a dead ally or creature 
into a zombie for three minutes.

10:21.550 --> 10:26.230
We'll use it to forcibly connect his 
body and mind for three minutes.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.540
Rudy!

10:34.220 --> 10:35.350
Rudy...

10:35.350 --> 10:36.470
Rudy!

10:44.320 --> 10:45.040
Rudy...

10:45.430 --> 10:46.400
Rudy!

10:49.250 --> 10:51.350
Miss Isuzu...

10:51.970 --> 10:53.220
Where am I?

10:57.540 --> 10:59.790
Oh, I see...

11:00.270 --> 11:02.990
I died, didn't I?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.750
Don't look so sad, everyone...

11:07.570 --> 11:12.100
Dying is a natural consequence of battle.

11:13.650 --> 11:15.010
Natural?

11:15.390 --> 11:19.390
Even so, I wanted to be an adventurer.

11:20.130 --> 11:23.220
Don't blame Miss Isuzu.

11:23.830 --> 11:26.450
It was I who begged her to do it.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.020
I...

11:28.370 --> 11:30.400
I knew it, too!

11:31.090 --> 11:33.700
I knew it, too, but I...

11:33.700 --> 11:35.030
I...

11:35.390 --> 11:36.280
Minori...

11:37.660 --> 11:39.780
Thank you, Miss Minori.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.580
Don't let it bother you...

11:42.350 --> 11:44.160
No, I will let it bother me.

11:45.650 --> 11:47.010
Rundel Haus Code,

11:47.790 --> 11:52.420
I refuse to allow anyone who gives up so 
easily to call himself an adventurer.

11:52.890 --> 11:54.670
That's not nearly enough.

11:57.370 --> 11:59.740
What have you learned?

12:00.810 --> 12:04.790
What you acquired in the dungeon 
was not strategy and tactics,

12:04.790 --> 12:09.080
but the resolve to survive, and the 
fortitude to do whatever it takes to do so.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.750
Am I wrong?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.560
Shiroe...

12:12.870 --> 12:17.070
Your resolve is sorely lacking, Rundel Haus!

12:17.280 --> 12:19.820
Then what do you want me to do?

12:20.410 --> 12:22.320
Listen to me.

12:22.830 --> 12:24.430
That's...

12:24.430 --> 12:25.830
A contract?

12:26.510 --> 12:27.380
A contract.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.370
Shiroe, leader of the guild Log Horizon,

12:31.930 --> 12:35.280
establishes the following contract 
with Rundel Haus Code.

12:36.130 --> 12:44.160
1. Effective as of the date and time at which 
Rundel Haus Code signs this document,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.640
Shiroe accepts him as a member 
of the guild Log Horizon.

12:47.710 --> 12:53.930
2. As a member of the guild Log Horizon,

12:53.930 --> 12:58.130
Rundel Haus Code will fulfill his missions 
in a manner befitting his position.

12:59.590 --> 13:02.390
3. Log Horizon will provide Rundel Haus Code

13:02.390 --> 13:05.870
all necessary support required for his missions,

13:06.340 --> 13:09.710
to the greatest extent acceptable to both parties.

13:11.210 --> 13:14.330
This includes bestowing the status of "adventurer."

13:16.690 --> 13:22.740
4. This contract is signed in the spirit of mutual 
respect and agreement between both sides.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.100
Anything either party acquires, 
for the contract's duration,

13:26.100 --> 13:28.940
remains theirs, even in the event 
that the contract is nullified.

13:30.050 --> 13:35.270
Two copies of this contract will 
be signed by both parties,

13:35.750 --> 13:38.610
and each party will retain a copy.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.200
Shiroe, that's...

13:42.300 --> 13:47.720
<i>A new kind of magic that didn't exist 
when</i> Elder Tale <i>was a game! </i>

13:48.950 --> 13:51.870
<i>The secret to cooking that Chief Nyanta told us...</i>

13:51.890 --> 13:55.410
<b>Nyanta 
Race/ Cat-man 
Swashbuckler, Lv. 90</b>

13:52.540 --> 13:56.070
<i>If you cook it yourself, rather than 
relying on the cooking command,</i>

13:56.520 --> 13:58.960
<i>you can make tasty food, 
provided your skill level is high enough.</i>

13:59.880 --> 14:03.060
<i>I realized that this applied 
to more than cooking.</i>

14:01.920 --> 14:05.130
<b>This is a steam engine!</b>

14:04.040 --> 14:04.820
<i>And...</i>

14:05.460 --> 14:10.520
You're researching whether you can 
do something with the scribe skill?

14:11.440 --> 14:15.130
<i>The Fairy King's paper, made from 
the best ingredients in the game,</i>

14:15.960 --> 14:17.500
<i>ink from the Time Dragon's eye,</i>

14:18.570 --> 14:23.670
<i>and a contract written by a level-90 scribe.</i>

14:25.070 --> 14:28.740
<i>I don't know what effect this magic 
will have on this world.</i>

14:30.110 --> 14:30.940
<i>But...</i>

14:32.050 --> 14:33.660
I've added my signature.

14:34.150 --> 14:35.500
Now it only needs yours.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.710
An adventurer...

14:41.850 --> 14:43.800
This contract contains an element of risk.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.140
You'll be a different kind of being 
than you've been until now.

14:49.060 --> 14:52.810
We adventurers are still new to 
this world, and we don't know

14:52.810 --> 14:55.800
what we'll be caught up in from here on.

14:56.610 --> 15:00.690
I don't think adventurers garner all 
the glory you believe them to.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.060
What I want is to be...

15:05.010 --> 15:06.490
an adventurer.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.790
If I can save people who need my help,

15:10.420 --> 15:12.370
I don't care about the details...

15:13.550 --> 15:16.110
I don't want glory.

15:17.470 --> 15:19.390
I want to be an adventurer.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.060
It's okay.

15:26.860 --> 15:30.190
I'll write it with you.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.220
You need to die once, Rundel Haus.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.600
You'll come back to life at the Cathedral.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.310
A summoned creature, restricted to 
characters level 86 and above...

17:40.830 --> 17:41.890
The phoenix.

18:03.190 --> 18:07.100
Now, then... Let's tear them apart.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.880
The main dish is finished.

18:28.250 --> 18:32.410
We'll leave the rest to the 
strategic headquarters cordon.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.230
Are you okay, Marie?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.970
Are you really okay?

19:00.310 --> 19:01.810
No...

19:01.810 --> 19:03.510
I'm bushed.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.270
Hey, Naotsugu...

19:14.270 --> 19:15.360
What?

19:15.960 --> 19:18.350
We did good, right?

19:18.910 --> 19:20.330
Of course we did.

19:20.710 --> 19:23.410
We saved the town.

19:28.290 --> 19:33.980
Shiroe, why did you say that to Rundel Haus?

19:34.580 --> 19:35.730
Say what?

19:35.730 --> 19:38.520
About adventurers, and resolve.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.640
"Adventurers"...

19:45.070 --> 19:47.290
When <i>Elder Tale</i> was just a game,

19:47.290 --> 19:50.360
that was just a word we used for players.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.740
But now, I think it's something else.

19:55.910 --> 19:58.740
I think it's the name for my companions,

19:59.130 --> 20:01.910
those who travel the world with me,

20:02.640 --> 20:05.040
to find a dawn no one has ever seen.

20:25.890 --> 20:26.970
Where am I?

20:27.730 --> 20:28.970
Oh...

20:29.710 --> 20:32.340
This is the Cathedral?

20:34.610 --> 20:38.680
<b>Sub Class: Adventurer</b>

20:34.610 --> 20:38.680

20:40.340 --> 20:41.860
Wow.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.420
I did it...

20:44.220 --> 20:46.120
I'm an adventurer!

20:47.530 --> 20:49.330
Just the same as...

20:51.280 --> 20:52.350
Rudy!

20:55.560 --> 20:57.890
M-Miss Isuzu...

20:59.720 --> 21:01.810
Wh-What are you doing here?

21:02.260 --> 21:03.830
Oh, right...

21:03.830 --> 21:05.970
You used a return spell to come back?

21:05.970 --> 21:09.750
What if you had died, 
doing something that reckless?

21:09.750 --> 21:10.980
Rudy, you idiot!

21:10.980 --> 21:12.920
Th-That's rude!

21:13.470 --> 21:15.300
Sometimes, you have to be willing

21:15.300 --> 21:18.110
to sacrifice your life for duty, Miss Isuzu!

21:18.320 --> 21:21.110
If I tell you to wait, you wait!

21:21.440 --> 21:22.860
That's not fair...

21:23.140 --> 21:23.870
You wait!

21:27.360 --> 21:28.470
I'm sorry...

21:29.210 --> 21:32.220
I guess I made you worry...

21:35.990 --> 21:38.000
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.470
S-Sorryâ€”

21:43.790 --> 21:45.090
I w-won't do it againâ€”

21:46.920 --> 21:47.940
I get it!

21:47.940 --> 21:51.600
I get it! I'll do what you say, Miss Isuzu!

21:54.030 --> 21:55.150
Really?

21:55.150 --> 21:56.650
Really!

21:56.650 --> 21:58.030
I swear to God.

21:58.030 --> 22:01.190
And you're going to tell me 
about when you were a kid!

22:01.190 --> 22:03.090
Why? It isn't...

22:06.860 --> 22:08.420
F-Fine.

22:08.810 --> 22:09.930
I'll tell you.

22:09.930 --> 22:11.410
If you do crazy things like that,

22:11.410 --> 22:13.620
you won't survive, no matter 
how many lives you have!

22:14.910 --> 22:16.170
I'll remember that.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.420
Then give me your paw!

22:18.180 --> 22:18.850
Huh?

24:05.820 --> 24:06.950
The battle has ended.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.470
Eastal and the Round Table 
take a new step forward.

24:10.470 --> 24:13.200
To celebrate their victory, a ball is held.

24:13.200 --> 24:17.780
But Akatsuki is gloomy, amidst the cheer.

24:18.110 --> 24:21.150
Fall is coming to the town of Akihabara.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.020
Next time: The Two of Us Shall Waltz.

24:21.790 --> 24:29.930
<b>The Two of Us Shall Waltz</b>

24:24.440 --> 24:26.680
We will change the world.
