WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.307
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.351 --> 00:05.266
ARTURO:
Do you love him?

00:05.309 --> 00:06.528
LIZ: More than anything.Take the time

00:06.571 --> 00:08.965
to figure out what you want.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.749
You have Abuela's ring
in your hand, don't you?

00:10.793 --> 00:12.186
Sounds like a bad thing.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.056
I just can't help but wonder

00:13.100 --> 00:14.144
if it's the right time.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.929
FBI looks good on you,
Agent Cameron.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.149
CAMERON:
I think this heist was
committed by aliens.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.978
There was a bank robbery
over in Las Cruces.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.546
Cam thinks it's aliens.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.243
Did Alex ever determine
if Jones was able to...

00:26.287 --> 00:28.985
send a transmission
through the Lockhart machine?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.247
LIZ:
I thought I'd give you
something that helped me.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.641
My mentor, Allie Meyers,
she always says

00:32.684 --> 00:34.164
everything is
theoretically impossible

00:34.208 --> 00:36.862
until you make it a reality.

00:36.906 --> 00:39.126
This is what our Triad is
meant to do.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.390
Oh, my God, are you seeing this?

00:42.433 --> 00:44.218
[exclaims]

00:47.395 --> 00:49.353
MAX:
Roswell was once

00:49.397 --> 00:52.356
just a blip on the map
where cows outnumbered cowboys.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.054
That is,

00:54.097 --> 00:56.056
till a mystery fell
out of the sky.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.058
Check the wavelength readings.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.450
How many balloons went down?

00:59.494 --> 01:01.017
MAX:
Over time,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.019
the legend faded
into fairy tale.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.935
UFO enthusiasts never found
cosmic proof

01:05.978 --> 01:08.198
that we are not alone
in the universe.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.461
We went from hiding
in plain sight

01:10.505 --> 01:12.942
to living in peace...

01:14.422 --> 01:16.467
...until the sky fell again.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.166
The thing about legends is

01:19.209 --> 01:21.907
they never really fade.[sirens wailing]

01:24.171 --> 01:26.477
And this time around...

01:26.521 --> 01:29.393
there is no place to hide.

01:29.437 --> 01:32.179
♪ From trouble

01:32.222 --> 01:37.097
♪ There's trouble on the way.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.407
MAX: Tell me you
found something.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.409
Perfect timing.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.238
I mean,
test after test confirmed

01:48.282 --> 01:49.979
it's just a case
of St. Elmo's fire.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.329
Scientific St. Elmo's fire--

01:52.373 --> 01:55.158
it's an electromagnetic
corona discharge that glows

01:55.202 --> 01:56.986
due to high levels
of plasmic voltage

01:57.029 --> 01:59.945
that rip apart molecules
in the stratosphere.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.426
It's Earth science.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.167
It's not alien.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.255
Okay.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.170
We saw green streaks

02:07.214 --> 02:09.129
and shimmering rain
because that is

02:09.172 --> 02:12.219
how our eyes perceive
ionized protons.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.135
But for the cameras...
I wrote it all down

02:15.178 --> 02:17.746
for your press conference...
Sheriff.

02:17.789 --> 02:20.183
Well, I'd rather be
chasing bank robbers

02:20.227 --> 02:22.229
than smiling for cameras.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.144
But, uh, at least

02:24.187 --> 02:26.450
we only have one mystery
of the alien variety

02:26.494 --> 02:28.148
to deal with
for now.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.975
Do you think
they come in peace,

02:30.019 --> 02:32.282
or are they part
of Jones's contingency plan?

02:32.326 --> 02:33.762
I don't know.

02:33.805 --> 02:37.200
Breaking into bank vaults
isn't exactly a sign

02:37.244 --> 02:39.071
that they have good intentions.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.466
Okay, I'm gonna cover
a shift at the Crashdown.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.252
Papi's drowning
in tourists.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.341
Okay.

02:48.211 --> 02:51.040
You don't hate me, right?

02:51.083 --> 02:53.434
For needing more time?

02:53.477 --> 02:56.088
No, of course not.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.308
I couldn't be mad at you.

03:00.354 --> 03:03.183
I found a healthy balance
with you, Max.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.228
And that's the key
to our future together.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.361
So I just need to figure out
a way to sustain it.

03:07.404 --> 03:11.103
Well, wherever
the road takes you,

03:11.147 --> 03:13.280
I will be right by your side.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.803
[chuckles softly]

03:14.846 --> 03:17.371
Mm.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.201
Yes! How have you been?Hello? Liz?

03:21.244 --> 03:22.593
MAN: Can I start
with the alien skins, please?[whistling]

03:22.637 --> 03:24.508
LIZ: Oh, of course,
and you guys want two orders...?

03:24.552 --> 03:27.076
I mean...
That's okay.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.512
I'm late for Max's
press conference anyway.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.341
You cannot start your day
without a Shatner Shake.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.517
It is part of a complete
breakfast, plus...

03:33.561 --> 03:35.606
why would you want to rub
those cute little elbows

03:35.650 --> 03:37.565
up against sweaty rednecks

03:37.608 --> 03:40.394
who believe that chemtrails are
controlling our minds, right?

03:40.437 --> 03:44.093
Obviously, it's the aliens
controlling our minds.

03:44.136 --> 03:46.095
You don't actually believe

03:46.138 --> 03:48.445
in, um, benevolent creatures

03:48.489 --> 03:49.620
from another planet, do you?

03:49.664 --> 03:51.231
I believe
in possibilities.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.233
And if a possibility's
gonna lead me

03:53.276 --> 03:55.322
to a story, I'll pursue it.Like the St. Elmo's fire.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.540
Well, if I wanted
to report on the weather

03:56.584 --> 03:57.541
I'd be a meteorologist.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.151
I want to ask Max

03:59.195 --> 04:00.414
about the bank robberies.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.372
Little insider tip?

04:02.416 --> 04:05.549
I don't think Max is gonna
be very helpful about that.

04:05.593 --> 04:08.335
He told me that, um,
the FBI is handling it.

04:08.378 --> 04:11.642
Apparently Sheriff Evans
is going to be on, uh,

04:11.686 --> 04:13.601
yokel patrolall day.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.299
Thanks for the tip. And the
milkshake. Can I get that to go?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.518
I thought we were gonna,
like, hang out?

04:17.561 --> 04:19.128
The news never stops.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.260
Oh, I forgot
I'm on keto.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.305
Keep the milkshake.
Sorry, babe.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.090
My milkshakes are delicious!

04:25.134 --> 04:27.615
It's good-- back me up

04:27.658 --> 04:29.269
on this,
Pancake Papi.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.401
Delicious. You're hired.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.186
Uh, start
with refills on table five?

04:34.230 --> 04:36.450
What?And the dishes, thank you.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.197
My boss would like
a Rodden-berry Shake.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.330
And she also
requested Liz Ortecho

04:47.374 --> 04:49.289
to deliver it
to her on the roof.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.596
What you saw last night
was nothing more

04:52.640 --> 04:54.424
than a harmless bit of physics.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.426
Think of it as Mother Nature
putting on a free light show.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.168
As for the so-called
"flying saucers,"

04:59.211 --> 05:01.301
there is a research firm
in the area

05:01.344 --> 05:02.780
that is studying
weather patterns.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.305
Some of their equipment
went down during the storm.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.395
Listen, I understand
that you're frustrated.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.179
We have tourists coming in
from all over

05:10.222 --> 05:11.572
thinking this is
some kind of invasion.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.313
You have a lot of questions

05:13.356 --> 05:15.358
and I promise I will get you
real answers soon.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.926
GRAHAM:
That's what they said in 1947.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.232
Open your eyes.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.626
Last night was a harbinger

05:22.670 --> 05:24.367
of what's to come.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.369
The plasma activated microchips

05:26.413 --> 05:28.632
in our brains
that were implanted

05:28.676 --> 05:31.418
by Venusian parasites
swimming in our tap water.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.463
That explains
your low IQ.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.161
[laughter]

05:40.514 --> 05:42.429
Look me in the eye

05:42.472 --> 05:44.561
and tell me
this shimmering stuff

05:44.605 --> 05:46.563
isn't alien.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
They won't tell you
the truth, but I will.

05:51.786 --> 05:56.181
At my museum pop-up,
Graham Green's Galactic Gulch.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.664
Mm, so I'm guessing, uh,

06:00.708 --> 06:02.405
people weren't buying
what you were selling.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.320
Yeah, that's because
it was science.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.626
You told me those balloons
were aboveboard.They are.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.497
None of the ones that
we've retrieved so far

06:07.541 --> 06:09.412
show any signs
of alien activity.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.719
The goo on Graham's,
it-it shimmered

06:11.762 --> 06:13.416
like alien glass.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.375
We set off 40 balloons
over southern New Mexico,

06:15.418 --> 06:18.203
and we retrieved six of them
from the field. Those were fine.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.380
But in case any of the other
ones have any strange anomalies,

06:20.423 --> 06:21.859
I'll hit the road
and track them down.[phone chimes]

06:21.903 --> 06:24.296
But it's probably gonna be
a while until I know anything.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.342
Okay, well, that's all right,
I got to...

06:26.386 --> 06:28.692
chase down some intergalactic
fugitives anyway.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.260
Well, safe travels, Manes.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.522
Okay. Thanks.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.698
Oh, uh...

06:34.742 --> 06:36.308
hey, where do
you want me?

06:36.352 --> 06:39.747
Oh. I don't, um...

06:39.790 --> 06:41.531
You know what?
Why don't you, uh,

06:41.575 --> 06:43.446
make sure Guerin
stays out of trouble?

06:43.490 --> 06:44.491
Yeah?

06:45.492 --> 06:46.536
Guer...

06:46.580 --> 06:48.451
[door opens]

06:48.495 --> 06:51.323
Mmm. Mmm.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.718
Absolutely phenomenal.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.547
My wife said you were
a brilliant scientist,

06:57.591 --> 06:59.593
but she never mentioned
your culinary skills.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.333
Your wife?

07:01.377 --> 07:03.466
Allie Meyers.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.468
Your former professor.
She could not stop talking

07:05.512 --> 07:07.514
about how great you are.You're Allie's wife?

07:07.557 --> 07:09.733
Mm-hmm.Wait, didn't she
marry some...

07:09.777 --> 07:10.821
tech billionaire?

07:10.865 --> 07:13.824
I prefer "visionary futurist."

07:13.868 --> 07:15.391
Shivani Sen,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
founder of
Senovative Enterprises.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.613
Scotch?You didn't come

07:19.656 --> 07:22.442
all the way to Roswell
for a spiked milkshake. So?

07:22.485 --> 07:24.574
When an unexplained event
happens in a town

07:24.618 --> 07:27.577
known for mysterious
sci-fi occurrences,

07:27.621 --> 07:30.275
my helicopter lands
the next morning.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.321
Mysterious, sure.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.757
But you're not gonna
make any money

07:33.801 --> 07:35.367
off of a lightning storm.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.457
It's New Mexico.
We have ten of those a day.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.416
Oh. Not everything
is about money, Liz.

07:40.938 --> 07:44.594
Allie and I got married on
this charming little island

07:44.638 --> 07:45.769
in the Galapagos.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.771
You should have seen
how excited she was

07:47.815 --> 07:49.512
about the
algae. But...

07:49.556 --> 07:50.905
government
wouldn't let her touch it,

07:50.948 --> 07:52.863
so I had no choice
but to step in.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.648
And by "step in," you mean...

07:54.691 --> 07:55.866
I purchased it.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.520
Yeah...

07:57.564 --> 08:00.523
But for love, Liz,
not for profit.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.743
Studying it made her happy.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.701
At a certainpoint,

08:04.745 --> 08:06.398
money gets boring.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.357
Discovering the
secrets of the universe

08:08.400 --> 08:09.663
that no one else knows?

08:09.706 --> 08:12.404
That's where the fun is.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.624
Now you sound like a scientist.

08:14.668 --> 08:18.541
No, I just share their
thirst for knowledge.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.500
So I employ lots of them.

08:20.543 --> 08:24.373
Allie said that you developed
patents at Genoryx.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.331
So you're here
to offer me a job?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.464
If Liz Ortecho wanted a job,

08:28.508 --> 08:29.726
she'd already have one.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.641
I see this
more as a...

08:31.685 --> 08:33.513
partnership

08:33.556 --> 08:35.732
between two very
inquisitive minds.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.909
I'm taking a step back
from research.Hmm.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.911
Focusing on teaching.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.826
Good for you.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.436
I brought you a gift.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.917
Um, but if you're
not sciencing anymore,

08:46.961 --> 08:49.441
maybe I shouldn't have?

08:50.617 --> 08:53.141
What is it?Technically,
it's a regift.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.404
Don't hate me,
but one of my researchers

08:55.447 --> 08:57.580
trampled on it
out in the field.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.451
Poor little guy.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.889
I already sequenced
its genome.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.544
But I thought
you'd enjoy a good puzzle.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.722
I got to get back
to my tables.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.682
My contact info
is in your inbox.

09:13.596 --> 09:17.600
If you want to probe
the mysteries of Roswell...
