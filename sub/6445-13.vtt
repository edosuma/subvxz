WEBVTT

00:14.223 --> 00:15.759
Chloe, what the heck is this?

00:15.933 --> 00:18.549
I thought we were coming in
to get a coffee?

00:18.727 --> 00:20.058
How could you do this to me?

00:20.229 --> 00:23.596
I didn't know, I swear.
I'm sorry, Clark.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.686
No, hey. You're not gonna spend
the rest of your life....

00:26.860 --> 00:29.772
...hiding in the barn either.
Let's go.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.858
What's it you say about
Valentine's Day?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.614
Oh, yeah,
our annual sneak peek at hell.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.776
That must have been
before Cupid struck.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.411
Don't you think after being trapped
in a front seat...

00:39.581 --> 00:42.573
...to the Clark-Lana operetta,
I deserve a good V day?

00:42.751 --> 00:45.618
You're the only person
who can make me feel guilty...

00:45.796 --> 00:48.959
...relieved and a little sad,
all in one sentence.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.130
It's a gift.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.381
Don't worry, Clark.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.545
Your "Achy Breaky Heart" will
go away too one of these days.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.588
Can you put that in writing?

00:57.766 --> 00:59.757
Just give the Lana thing
a little more time.

00:59.935 --> 01:03.473
You never know when the next love
of your life is right around the corner.

01:06.191 --> 01:10.525
Is it really wrong that I want these
chubby cherubs to burst into ﬂames?

01:10.696 --> 01:14.109
The way I see it, Valentine's Day
is like ﬁnding out how babies are born.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.114
-What?
-Just stay with me.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.322
It seems so weird and confusing,
but when that bomb ﬁnally hits...

01:19.496 --> 01:23.614
...it's like, everything clicks into place.
You know, it all seems to makes sense.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.503
Jimmy.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.925
And Lois.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.881
Welcome to the love-fest.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.842
Yeah, and me without my Uzi.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.141
Excuse us for just one second.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.896
What are you doing?

01:45.063 --> 01:48.021
We were supposed to take Clark
out tonight, remember?

01:48.192 --> 01:50.353
Yeah, but Lois was all alone...

01:50.527 --> 01:51.778
...and then it hit me.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.740
Lois and Clark.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.110
Lois and Clark?

02:01.288 --> 02:03.244
You gotta admit they got chemistry.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.201
Yeah, so do nitroglycerin and peroxide.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.242
And I don't suggest
putting them together.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.040
Come on.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.219
Please tell me we weren't just set up.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.852
Looks like it.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.263
Us.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.357
That's like hot fudge and halibut.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.147
I take it, I'm the halibut.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.525
Naturally.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.567
Well, I've had my ﬁll of fat babies
with arrows.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.327
Knock yourself out, Lois.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.784
Little down on love?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.408
After my breakup?

02:49.586 --> 02:53.249
Cupid could use me for target practice
and I still wouldn't feel anything.

02:53.423 --> 02:57.541
Then maybe you need a little
euphoria elixir or romance remedy.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.012
Just a nudge in order to move on.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.683
Move on?

03:03.851 --> 03:07.218
Honey, you're talking to somebody
who's still waiting for acid-washed...

03:07.396 --> 03:09.307
...to come back in style.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.138
Try this.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.441
It's made with jasmine
and a mixture of aphrodisiac oils.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.688
| get the brilliant hue
from red meteor rocks.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.946
This is gonna make me fall in love
with someone new?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.582
The ﬁrst man you set eyes on.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.540
Who knows, maybe this color
will look good on me, huh?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.705
Clark.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.511
Yes, I'm calling to RSVP
for the engagement party.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.098
Martha Kent. Thank you.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.853
Hi. How was the Valentine's party?

05:16.024 --> 05:18.731
-I lived to see another day.
-Clark.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.736
Mom, really, if it's more love advice,
I got my quota last night. Trust me.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.442
But thank you.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.248
Lois.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.882
ls Clark here?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.258
Yeah, come in.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.509
Hey, Lois, listen I'm sorry that Jimmy
pulled you into that last night.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.848
I mean, after Oliver and—

05:57.399 --> 05:59.264
Oliver's history.

06:01.194 --> 06:05.278
Actually, Mrs. K.,
can you give us a couple minutes?

06:06.491 --> 06:09.904
Yeah, I'll be upstairs.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.714
Here we ﬁnd ourselves...

06:23.884 --> 06:25.795
...all alone.

06:29.097 --> 06:33.181
How did I never notice what big,
strong hands you have?

06:35.479 --> 06:36.719
What's going on, Lois?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.228
Well, you know me.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.889
I'm not very good with words. So...

06:45.614 --> 06:48.356
People don't think Whitesnake
sings power ballads...

06:48.658 --> 06:49.864
...but they do.

06:51.286 --> 06:55.529
-You made me a mix CD?
-Yeah.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.455
I will kill you if you tell anyone this,
but--

07:03.256 --> 07:06.464
There's nothing that I love more...

07:06.843 --> 07:09.334
...than slow dancing...

07:09.513 --> 07:13.381
...with some big,
strong arms around me.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.592
Just like yours, Smallville.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.268
Lois-- Lois, why don't you go
put this on?

07:25.654 --> 07:26.814
Okay.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.237
I know how you dance, so...

07:35.622 --> 07:37.704
...just in case—

07:40.168 --> 07:41.544
Clark?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.632
Lana.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.048
I'm kind of surprised to see you here.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.933
Yeah, I know that we left things
in a weird place.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.386
Come in.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.563
I'll take credit for the weirdness...

08:07.737 --> 08:10.729
...but to be honest, you're the one
who did the leaving.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.740
l was-- I was really frustrated.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.738
Chloe, I can't afford to lose you too.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.246
Ever since I've been with Lex,
| feel like I've lost...

08:23.420 --> 08:25.035
...everyone else in my life.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.372
Well, are you sure
it's that you lost them...

08:28.550 --> 08:31.007
...or were you being forced
to leave them behind?

08:32.971 --> 08:36.179
It seems like you've been walled up
in the mansion.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.726
It's not like I'm in captivity.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.761
Right, not in so many words
but I know how protective Lex is...

08:41.938 --> 08:43.769
...over the things he values the most.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.352
Chloe, I know that you're
just looking out for me.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.519
And you've done your maid of honor
duty and asked the tough questions.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.814
But, I was hoping that
we could just get past this?

08:55.744 --> 08:57.826
Okay. Case closed.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.410
Did I—? Did I miss something?
Maid of honor?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.707
Yeah, I hope
that you're not allergic to taffeta.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.213
That's actually why I came by.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.337
Will you stand up with me?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.590
Of course.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.638
So does this mean
that we just ignore...

09:22.812 --> 09:25.349
...the huge elephant
named Clark in the corner?

09:25.523 --> 09:27.559
You know, whatever he's hiding...

09:27.734 --> 09:30.521
...he chose to conﬁde in the people
that he trusts the most.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.562
And as much as I wish
that I was one of those people...

09:33.740 --> 09:36.527
...I can't hold it against you.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.693
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Clark's secret.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.580
If you'll stop denying that he has one.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.565
Will this holiday ever end?

10:19.244 --> 10:22.611
Sorry to be the culprit
of such a felony sized PDA.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.654
We were supposed to meet
20 minutes ago.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.073
Where have you been?

10:26.251 --> 10:29.709
| just got stuck in trafﬁc.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.417
I did some digging into
our favorite Martian man hunter...

10:33.591 --> 10:35.127
...but It's just coming up empty.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.293
We have another man hunter
to worry about.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.719
Lois.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.388
Why does that make me picture her
wielding an ax...

10:42.559 --> 10:44.095
...at every man in Metropolis?

10:44.269 --> 10:45.930
She's only after one man.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.937
Lois...

10:51.401 --> 10:52.390
...is into me.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.358
She's into you? What, like--?

11:04.039 --> 11:07.497
Wow, she really pulled out all the stops.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.249
She's not herself, all right?
It's like she overdosed...

11:10.420 --> 11:13.287
...on "Love Potion Number 9"
or something. This isn't funny.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.921
Pretty funny.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.384
Chloe, we have to ﬁnd out what
happened before she strikes again.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.512
-Too late.
-There you are.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.174
l have been searching all over for you.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.098
Look what I got.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.268
Maybe you could get one to match.

11:37.781 --> 11:41.990
I think you're right about that story.
I'm gonna look into it.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.071
Chloe--

11:44.996 --> 11:46.406
Hi, you.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.946
Hi.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.791
Lois.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.457
Now, Lois, I've got—

11:55.632 --> 11:58.374
Now, you can pour on
the modesty all you want, Smallville.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.633
It only makes you
that much more adorable.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.841
Lois, what happened to you
when I left last night?

12:04.015 --> 12:06.347
I went home. Alone.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.468
But you know where I wanted to be.

12:32.544 --> 12:37.163
Wow, well, nothing screams romance
like a dusty newspaper ofﬁce.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.831
Come on, you can do better than this.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.667
l was planning on it.

12:42.846 --> 12:46.213
Not that I'm complaining,
but isn't this a little sudden?

12:46.391 --> 12:50.134
I mean, all this time, one kiss
and all of a sudden you like me?

12:51.396 --> 12:52.806
No, I mean it.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.721
This is for real, isn't it?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.482
Oh, yeah, this couldn't be more real.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.905
Wait a minute.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.532
Wait.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.453
I knew I kissed you before.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.411
In the alley.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.832
You're Green Arrow.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.087
Hardly.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.375
l was just pretending to be
so you wouldn't know it was Oliver.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.252
Oliver?

13:27.599 --> 13:29.339
Oh, my God.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.633
All those times he disappeared.

13:34.981 --> 13:39.270
What is my deal with emotionally
unavailable weekend warriors?

13:47.285 --> 13:50.243
Thank God, I ﬁnally found a normal guy.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.453
What do you mean normal?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.407
Oliver's not even
in the same league as me.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.247
You don't have to be macho just for me.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.753
I like the dorky-farm-boy thing.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.426
Dorkier than a hood and a quiver?

14:08.389 --> 14:12.348
Just because I don't wear a costume
and splash my face all over the papers--

14:12.519 --> 14:15.977
Clark. So what if your signature move
is driving a tractor.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.555
I think it's adorable.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.063
You know, Lois, I think that it's time...

14:23.238 --> 14:25.945
...for you to meet the real Clark Kent.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.802
l have a surprise for you.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.336
I thought we said no gifts
for the engagement dinner.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.755
It's not exactly for the dinner.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.156
So I have this dilemma.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.787
I can't decide between...

15:18.167 --> 15:20.249
...Stegosaurus...

15:20.420 --> 15:22.251
...or Mr. Duck.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.832
That's really sweet, Lex.

15:28.052 --> 15:32.170
-But don't you think it's kind of--?
-I know, I know, it's kind of early.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.010
But the doctor said
you're perfectly healthy.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.804
| just don't know if it's a good idea
to have all of this stuff out here.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.688
There's a lot of people around.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.851
Nobody knows about this pregnancy
apart from Clark and Chloe.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.769
Well, what if they did?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.983
l was thinking.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.241
What if we announced it tonight
at the party?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.199
I don't know if that's a great idea.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.661
I think that tonight should be
about our engagement.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.045
lt sort of feels like you're in denial.

16:10.637 --> 16:15.006
Like if no one ﬁnds out about the baby,
it doesn't exist.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.639
Lex, do you know how many people
are looking over my shoulder...

16:20.813 --> 16:23.725
...second-guessing why I'm marrying you?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.651
Am I that hard a sell?

16:29.822 --> 16:33.781
I don't want people assuming that we're
getting married because of this baby.

16:33.951 --> 16:38.320
I want them to know
that I'm with you because I love you.

16:52.970 --> 16:58.306
Wow, this is a beautiful detour
but what are we doing up here?

16:59.060 --> 17:01.346
That's Oliver's balcony over there,
isn't it?

17:03.106 --> 17:06.098
What? That tiny speck
under the clock tower?

17:11.948 --> 17:14.234
Clark, this isn't funny.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.616
You can come back down now.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.031
Or you could come up here with me.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.466
I'd like to see Oliver do this.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.153
What'd you say
about a dorky farm boy?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.873
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.754
I can't wait to see
what else you can do.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.461
Well, I'm fast.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.000
But not too fast.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.338
You're being very bad.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.508
The last time I was here,
l was with a good friend of yours.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.597
Obviously, he wasn't that good.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.617
I better make sure
you didn't spell my name wrong.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.775
Sounds like a real rager, doesn't it?

19:14.946 --> 19:17.437
Can't say I'm surprised I wasn't invited.

19:17.615 --> 19:21.574
l RSVP'd back before Oliver
headed for the hills.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.246
But now I've found a better way
to occupy my night.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.246
What, and disappoint
the future Mrs. Luthor?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.907
I don't think so, besides--

19:30.419 --> 19:33.377
It's not a party until someone crashes it.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.971
Hey, thanks for the roses.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.098
Thanks for this.

19:50.273 --> 19:54.607
Yeah, I don't know, ljust--
It, kind of, seemed very you.

19:54.777 --> 19:59.020
I love it. But it might sit on the bench
until my next style renaissance.

19:59.198 --> 20:04.443
Or until I'm off the blacklist
at the Luthor mansion.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.120
Aren't you supposed to be leaving
for Smallville in negative two minutes?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.577
Yeah. But I'm gonna have to push
the boundaries...

20:10.751 --> 20:12.332
...of fashionably late on this one.

20:12.503 --> 20:16.371
Because I just got a huge lead
on whatever love-nip Lois rolled in.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.586
You just can't admit that
I'm a natural born Cupid, can you?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.752
Jimmy, I know that you would love
to think your little nudge...

20:22.930 --> 20:25.342
...actually caused this whole thing,
but trust me...

20:25.516 --> 20:27.598
...Lois would have to be shot
out of a cannon...

20:27.768 --> 20:30.805
...to romantically land
anywhere in the direction of Clark.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.097
Sounds kind of like you're jealous.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.557
Of Lois?

20:36.736 --> 20:39.523
No, of anyone getting
in between you and Clark.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.064
Come on, you spend
all your time with him...

20:43.242 --> 20:45.278
...then you make up
all these excuses why?

20:45.453 --> 20:46.442
You know what, Jimmy?

20:46.621 --> 20:49.829
On the list of personality quirks
I've learned to fall in love with...

20:49.999 --> 20:52.160
...paranoia is deﬁnitely at the bottom.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.497
-Translated to back off?
-Yep.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.161
Got it.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.799
-Chloe?
-Pushing it.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.886
Look, if you're really not jealous...

21:06.057 --> 21:09.345
...then why are you bailing on your
best friend's engagement party?

21:09.810 --> 21:12.392
Clark's a big boy.
How much damage can Lois really do?

21:15.775 --> 21:16.855
You know, you're right.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.775
I can just delegate.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.693
I've done that.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.734
Once.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.149
And, since I doubt
the rose peddler doused Lois.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.534
I'm putting all my money
on the oil essence lady.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.241
So you can just meet her in an hour.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.406
Here's the address.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.041
Thanks. You're my guy.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.395
Looking for a little inspiration?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.732
No, thanks, I've already got my muse.

22:05.574 --> 22:10.694
So is this supposed to make you
feel blissful or whatever?

22:10.871 --> 22:13.829
Not supposed to, it does.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.286
Now, that sounds kind of easy.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.168
You're on the rebound,
you just rub some sexy goo on and...

22:20.339 --> 22:22.079
...you're singing Barry White songs.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.750
Indigenous cultures have used
herbal oils for centuries.

22:25.928 --> 22:29.136
We've strayed so far from nature,
we think we're above it.

22:30.725 --> 22:34.058
Yeah, yeah, nature good,
greenhouse gases bad, I get it.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.683
Look, my girlfriend thinks
that you dosed her cousin...

22:37.857 --> 22:39.848
...with a love potion last night.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.563
Tall, loud, down on love?

22:42.737 --> 22:43.897
That would be Lois.

22:44.071 --> 22:48.064
So do you have any, like,
anti-love exfoliate or whatever?

22:48.242 --> 22:51.575
I mean, something to take the Vaseline
off the lens, so to speak?

22:58.335 --> 23:00.917
This will counteract the aphrodisiac.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.420
But I usually have a sixth sense
about people.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.632
Something tells me
Lois and Clark's destinies...

23:10.806 --> 23:13.923
...are a little more entwined
than they realize.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.794
Could I have everyone's attention,
please?

23:48.135 --> 23:51.502
I just wanted to thank you all
for joining us to celebrate.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.219
Over the years, I'm sure some of you
have placed a few bets...

23:55.392 --> 23:57.519
...on whether I'd settle down.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.307
But this couldn't be further
from settling.

24:02.525 --> 24:05.517
I'd like to toast my beautiful ﬁancee...

24:05.694 --> 24:08.527
...for making me happier
than I thought I could ever be.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.033
-Looks like we missed dinner.
-Clark.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.368
What are you doing here?

24:20.543 --> 24:23.831
Come on, Lex, you didn't think
I was gonna miss this, did you?

24:26.507 --> 24:27.496
And look.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.337
My own mother would rather raise
a glass with the enemy...

24:30.511 --> 24:31.671
...than stand by her son.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.553
Clark, you're not yourself.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.179
It's okay, Mom.

24:36.350 --> 24:39.092
You're more a Luthor
than a Kent these days, anyway.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.682
I mean, Dad's been, what?
Dead a year?

24:43.065 --> 24:45.306
Who can blame you
for joining the race with Lana?

24:45.484 --> 24:48.942
To see who's gonna add the Luthor
monogram to their name ﬁrst.

24:50.573 --> 24:54.862
Lex, he's obviously on something
and he wants us to react. Please don't.

24:58.122 --> 25:02.331
Chloe, I can't say that I'm surprised
that you're celebrating here.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.460
After all, once Lana's off the market
all those years of unrequited pining...

25:06.630 --> 25:08.666
...may actually pay off.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.545
I can't say I haven't thought about it.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.721
And you.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.055
You know, I gotta hand it to you.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.683
If you were gonna rebound...

25:24.857 --> 25:27.940
...why not choose the one person
that I hated the most?

25:28.319 --> 25:31.061
But I mean, come on, Lana.
The jokes over by now, isn't it?

25:31.947 --> 25:34.233
Clark, I think you've done
enough damage.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.774
-Why don't you leave.
-I am not done yet.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.072
Besides, Lex...

25:39.622 --> 25:41.988
...I haven't given you my gift yet.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.912
Congratulations on sealing the deal.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.674
To Baby Luthor.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.601
The real reason
that Lana's marrying you.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.941
Lex!

26:14.323 --> 26:15.312
How dare you!

26:15.491 --> 26:19.700
Come on, if no one else in this room
is gonna save you from Lex, then I will.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.112
I don't think so.
Lana is your past.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.034
I'm your future.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.991
This is the present.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.476
Clark was acting like he was exposed
to Red Kryptonite.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.643
It wasn't a coincidence that Lois went
hopelessly devoted at the same time.

26:53.821 --> 26:57.359
According to Jimmy,
I think we may have found our culprit.

26:57.783 --> 26:58.818
Lipstick?

26:58.993 --> 27:02.781
Infused with a Cupid's cocktail,
Lois was hit with an aphrodisiac.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.697
-But that shouldn't affect Clark.
-Well, it didn't.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.785
I'm guess the Iipstick's
ruby-red sheen...

27:07.960 --> 27:09.825
...didn't come from
crushed cranberries.

27:10.004 --> 27:13.496
If he was infected by a kryptonite kiss,
the second he was away from Lois...

27:13.674 --> 27:15.210
...he should've been ﬁne.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.376
I think Lois' kisses
were a little more than skin deep.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.169
I think it's in his system.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.382
He wasn't good enough for me
anyway.

27:25.894 --> 27:29.887
I'll let you handle Lois. Hopefully,
I can ﬁnd Clark before Lex does.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.400
Hey, you got it?

27:32.568 --> 27:36.561
Mugwort a.k.a.
a delegating success story.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.573
Now, once this hits her skin,
Lois' pumpkin ride is over.

27:40.743 --> 27:43.780
What does she have that I don't?

27:44.121 --> 27:47.238
It's so weird to see her acting like a girl.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.163
What's that?

27:56.342 --> 27:59.084
Just a little something to help break
the infatuation spell.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.923
I think it's time we get
those glass slippers back.

28:02.556 --> 28:06.265
You know what?
Stop making fun of my feelings.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.769
Just because you never got Clark...

28:18.947 --> 28:21.029
...doesn't mean you need
to take it out on me.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.800
This is awkward.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.639
Please tell me
I was going to a costume party.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.235
You humiliated me in front of my friends.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.315
Come on, Lana.
You hardly knew anyone at that party.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.696
-C|ark, what do you want from me?
-What I've always wanted.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.121
For you to be happy.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.995
I would love to know how that feels.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.499
But it seems like every time I get close,
you rip it all away from me.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.161
Lana, stop kidding yourself.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.335
You're never gonna be satisﬁed
with Lex.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.002
You can't marry him.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.347
I've already made up my mind.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.510
Even though you're still in love with me?

29:40.362 --> 29:42.353
What makes you so sure?

29:42.531 --> 29:44.988
Because I'm still in love with you.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.677
Don't marry Lex.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.478
Marry me.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.854
I have given you...

30:25.073 --> 30:27.234
...every chance.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.569
I have stood in this spot...

30:31.747 --> 30:32.736
...so many times...

30:32.915 --> 30:37.204
...just waiting for you to say
something and you decide to do it now?

30:42.758 --> 30:46.046
You don't love me, Clark.

30:46.803 --> 30:50.341
You just can't stand the idea
that I love someone else.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.093
Lana?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.228
Lana.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.944
Lex.

31:14.122 --> 31:18.081
Go ahead, Lana,
tell him that you'd rather be with me.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.583
Don't listen to him.
He's on something.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.750
Well, it didn't seem to bother you
two minutes ago...

31:23.924 --> 31:25.539
...when you were kissing me.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.756
What do you really expect
is gonna happen now, Clark?

31:29.930 --> 31:31.716
Exactly what you're afraid of.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.926
I'm not a competition.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.057
You are to Lex.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.310
He didn't tell you?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.142
He's always wanted everything
I've ever had.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.728
And you were at the top of that list.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.148
You're just a trophy to him.

31:48.115 --> 31:51.323
And he's nothing
but your consolation prize.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.285
Tell me you don't love me.

32:01.128 --> 32:04.165
-Lana. Tell me you don't—
-Stay away from her.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.754
You don't wanna do that.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.631
You can't win.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.293
You don't even know the rules
of the game.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.184
Clark, stop it.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.523
If I'd have known who you were
gonna turn out to be...

32:25.694 --> 32:28.026
...I never would have saved you
on that bridge.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.653
Clark, you're killing him.

32:43.337 --> 32:44.668
Lana.

32:44.838 --> 32:48.046
Let me handle this. Please, just leave.

33:08.153 --> 33:11.020
Clark, are you okay?

33:11.865 --> 33:13.947
Oh, sweetie.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.292
If you hadn't shown up in time...

33:29.466 --> 33:31.752
...l'm not sure what I would have
done to Lex.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.923
How'd you know what to do?

33:36.098 --> 33:39.010
The last time you had some kind of
kryptonite in your system...

33:39.184 --> 33:40.424
...you had to sweat it out.

33:40.602 --> 33:43.184
Weakening you
seemed to be our only chance.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.312
I just can't believe all those things I did.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.731
I can.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.613
I guess I can't blame you
for being mad at me too.

33:54.991 --> 33:58.904
Clark, you've walked around here
for years bottling everything up...

33:59.079 --> 34:01.912
...basing every decision
on what's best for other people.

34:02.082 --> 34:05.040
You never stop to think
what's best for you.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.870
Mom, you don't think I really meant
those things I said about you and Chloe?

34:10.173 --> 34:12.505
I think there was a grain of truth
in all of it.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.167
Every time you've been affected
by Red Kryptonite...

34:15.345 --> 34:17.085
...it hasn't changed who you are...

34:17.264 --> 34:19.300
...it's just stripped away
your inhibitions.

34:19.933 --> 34:23.676
I think you need to start being
more honest about how you feel.

34:25.731 --> 34:29.269
So you're saying that I wanna kiss Lois.
And keep Chloe in my back pocket...

34:29.443 --> 34:31.855
...while the whole time,
I'm still in love with Lana?

34:32.028 --> 34:34.644
You're the only one
who can sort that out.

34:34.823 --> 34:38.065
When I kissed Lana, I could tell
that she still felt something.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.744
And, Mom....

34:40.454 --> 34:42.160
Mom, I can't let her marry Lex.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.662
This is probably hard to hear.

34:48.295 --> 34:52.163
But I think the best thing you can do
is leave her alone.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.502
Clark. Girl alert.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.514
I never know what I'll ﬁnd
in the grown man's clubhouse.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.054
Oh, sorry, Mrs. Kent.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.270
Hey, Lois.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.185
Yeah, hi.

35:19.326 --> 35:24.696
Well, I talked to Chloe
and she ﬁlled me in...

35:24.873 --> 35:26.363
...on Lois Gone Wild.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.624
But I'm just missing a few details...

35:29.795 --> 35:31.035
...about us.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.880
Like this.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.631
Wow, Lois, I had no idea.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.515
Save it, Smallville.
I was obviously on something.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.596
Thank God, the ink wears off
in a week.

35:54.069 --> 35:57.857
Well, I guess it's best
that neither of us remembers.

35:58.031 --> 36:01.649
I mean, I can't even really picture
the two of us.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.246
You don't think...

36:09.543 --> 36:10.749
...that we--?

36:13.171 --> 36:14.957
Think that we what?

36:18.552 --> 36:20.213
You know?

36:21.930 --> 36:23.545
That we--

36:28.603 --> 36:29.979
No, Lois.

36:31.982 --> 36:33.688
I think I'd remember.

36:35.068 --> 36:36.274
Yeah.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.939
Of course, you would.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.314
Highlight of your life.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.232
Though I did ﬁnd something.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.372
I think you made it for me.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.465
Whitesnake?

37:05.807 --> 37:07.923
I must have really liked you.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.741
Hey, put another one down
for the J-Chlo team.

37:26.912 --> 37:30.905
Thanks to you, Lois is back to her old,
heartbroken, abrasive self.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.993
I'm glad I could help with that.
I guess.

37:33.168 --> 37:36.501
And, Clark is, well,
back to being Clark.

37:36.671 --> 37:40.038
Well, you're kind of brushing a landﬁll
under the rug, aren't you?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.545
What? With Clark?

37:43.011 --> 37:47.175
So he took the whole breakup jealousy
way past the drunk dialing stage.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.509
Can't arrest him for it.

37:48.683 --> 37:52.847
He crashed Lana's party and told
the world that she's eating for two.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.063
Did I mention that
he kidnapped her?

37:57.233 --> 38:00.521
I guarantee you Clark is beating
himself up more than anyone right now.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.186
We can just give the Clark
bashing a reprieve, okay?

38:03.365 --> 38:06.949
No. No, not until you admit
that he royally screwed up.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.401
You don't know him like I do.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.446
And you remind me of that every day.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.207
If I did the things he did...

38:16.378 --> 38:18.869
...you would never talk to me again.
Don't deny that.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.584
So, what are you saying?
I'm lying to you now?

38:25.261 --> 38:27.513
Can you really tell me?

38:28.390 --> 38:31.803
If you had the choice,
you wouldn't rather be with him?

38:40.068 --> 38:43.231
Of course not. You're my guy.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.240
Now you don't believe me.
I don't know what else to say.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.700
Well, I think that's the point.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.457
Neither of us do.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.670
You know, maybe we should
take a break.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.174
Jimmy, I don't—

39:37.167 --> 39:40.625
You're ﬁne, Miss Lang.
Nothing to worry about.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.791
Thank you, doctor.
I just wanted to be sure...

39:43.965 --> 39:46.957
...with everything
Lana went through yesterday.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.769
Lex, I'm really sorry
about what happened last night.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.801
About Clark.

40:00.106 --> 40:04.475
As far as I'm concerned, what we have
doesn't have anything to do with Clark.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.643
But then I wasn't the one
kissing him.

40:09.157 --> 40:12.149
And I wasn't the one holding a gun
to his head.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.948
Funny how he calls this a game.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.244
What were you gonna do, Lex?
Shoot him?

40:22.879 --> 40:24.335
If I had to.

40:24.506 --> 40:27.669
To save me? Or to hurt him?

40:29.594 --> 40:32.461
Considering what he did to you, Lana.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.720
I had every right to come after Clark.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.466
But the thing is—

40:39.354 --> 40:40.844
I can't blame him.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.767
If I ever let you slip
through my ﬁngers...

40:47.862 --> 40:50.695
...l have no idea
what I'd be capable of.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.339
How is she really?

41:13.513 --> 41:16.971
Well, you know, this isn't the most
typical pregnancy.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.224
But everything's on schedule.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.962
