Previously on <i>Fairly Legal...</i>

00:02.201 --> 00:03.968
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:10.609 --> 00:13.644
Did you ever do anything stupid?
I kissed somebody I work with.

00:13.712 --> 00:14.579
Wanna get some dinner tonight?

00:14.646 --> 00:15.713
Dinner?

00:15.781 --> 00:16.981
Tonight, 7:00 P.M. pick a place.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.082
It's a date.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.550
It's not a date.

00:19.618 --> 00:20.651
What are you, going on a date?

00:20.719 --> 00:22.120
Nope.

00:22.187 --> 00:23.988
You know how you have
a tendency to blow things up

00:24.056 --> 00:26.324
you really shouldn't?

00:26.391 --> 00:27.725
Man to man... the truth.

00:27.793 --> 00:29.026
She was at Justin's.

00:29.094 --> 00:30.695
I never came over here tonight.

00:30.763 --> 00:33.464
He came to my place when you stood him up.

00:33.532 --> 00:34.899
He knows you went to Justin's.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.467
What does he care?

00:36.535 --> 00:37.635
You're different.

00:37.703 --> 00:38.703
He said that?

00:38.771 --> 00:41.272
He didn't have to.

00:46.211 --> 00:47.645
Forgive me,

00:47.713 --> 00:50.681
but what you call personality
is just tricks.

00:50.749 --> 00:52.817
Your clients are shallow crowd pleasers.

00:52.885 --> 00:54.385
At least they please somebody.

00:54.453 --> 00:55.553
Your clients snub authority.

00:55.621 --> 00:56.988
Because frankly,

00:57.055 --> 00:58.222
they think they're smarter
than everybody else.

00:58.290 --> 00:59.724
They're smart enough not to chase cars.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.125
Yes, and they give themselves a bath

01:01.193 --> 01:03.060
while you lay dying in front of them.

01:03.128 --> 01:04.529
Dogs win, yes?

01:04.596 --> 01:06.798
Cats! Choose cats.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.332
Kate, sorry to interrupt, but you have...

01:08.400 --> 01:11.969
A phone call.

01:55.514 --> 01:58.115
Ugh.

02:01.453 --> 02:05.256
- Oh, I had the wildest dream.
- I have Ben for you.

02:05.324 --> 02:08.158
Well, just tell him I didn't pick up.

02:08.227 --> 02:12.430
I cannot tell a lie.

02:12.497 --> 02:16.267
- Am I on speaker phone?
- Yes.

02:16.335 --> 02:17.702
Morning, Katie.

02:17.769 --> 02:19.237
Can't wait to hear about your wild dream.

02:19.304 --> 02:22.139
You can tell me all about it
on our way to Lake Tahoe!

02:22.207 --> 02:25.243
I'm not going to Lake Tahoe.

02:26.745 --> 02:28.145
Come in!

02:28.213 --> 02:29.747
You need to get up.
You're going to Lake Tahoe.

02:29.815 --> 02:32.149
What the hell is in Lake Tahoe?

02:32.217 --> 02:33.618
A client with a situation.

02:33.685 --> 02:35.019
Very wealthy client. Is that Ben?

02:35.087 --> 02:36.387
Chop-chop.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.655
Car's taking us to the airport.

02:37.723 --> 02:39.323
We'll be back by lunch.

02:39.391 --> 02:41.392
Kate, how can you just leave your clothes

02:41.460 --> 02:43.094
all over the floor... oh!

02:43.161 --> 02:46.464
Hi.

02:46.531 --> 02:49.367
Justin.

02:49.434 --> 02:50.735
Justin's there?

02:50.802 --> 02:52.637
Hello?

02:52.704 --> 02:54.071
I'm so sorry. I didn't know...

02:54.139 --> 02:56.340
that you two...

02:56.408 --> 02:57.742
were, um...

02:57.809 --> 02:59.377
Did you guys mute me?

02:59.444 --> 03:03.547
Uh... you know, I am sorry to barge in.

03:03.615 --> 03:05.449
- I'll just...
- Mm-hmm.

03:05.517 --> 03:06.417
I'll see you in 20.

03:06.485 --> 03:07.618
Bring a parka.

03:07.686 --> 03:10.221
Bye, Justin.

03:12.524 --> 03:15.026
What? I could care less
if she's sleeping with him.

03:15.093 --> 03:17.161
<i>Couldn't</i> care less.

03:17.229 --> 03:19.030
"Could care less" indicates
you care enough to care less.

03:19.097 --> 03:22.166
Of course, how much less you could care

03:22.234 --> 03:23.901
depends on how much
you do care, which is...

03:23.969 --> 03:25.736
Zero!

03:25.804 --> 03:29.140
And you can't care less than zero.

03:29.207 --> 03:32.910
True that... if that were true.

03:32.978 --> 03:37.048
What is the big deal

03:37.115 --> 03:39.317
because I'm sure
that it happens all the time.

03:39.384 --> 03:40.751
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't.

03:40.819 --> 03:41.953
Oh.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.354
Okay, but it's... it's...

03:43.422 --> 03:45.156
not like we're back together
though, right?

03:45.223 --> 03:46.824
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:46.892 --> 03:49.060
So then we're free to just be.

03:49.127 --> 03:50.461
Absolutely.

03:50.529 --> 03:52.063
There's no promises, no plans.

03:52.130 --> 03:53.230
There's no pressure.

03:53.298 --> 03:54.732
No, I've got enough pressure, right?

03:54.800 --> 03:56.634
Yeah, so then...

03:56.702 --> 03:59.270
you're okay with this, then, right?

03:59.338 --> 04:00.905
What do you think?

04:02.507 --> 04:04.141
Oh, shut up.

04:04.209 --> 04:05.843
Oy.

04:05.911 --> 04:07.845
Justin, you are gonna be the next D.A.

04:07.913 --> 04:09.246
How do you know?

04:09.314 --> 04:10.448
Because...

04:10.515 --> 04:11.449
- Mm!
- You...

04:11.516 --> 04:15.519
you always get what you want.

04:15.587 --> 04:18.889
Have a great day.

04:18.957 --> 04:20.057
Oh!

04:20.125 --> 04:21.492
If anybody asks what we're doing here...

04:21.560 --> 04:22.927
Mm-hmm.

04:22.995 --> 04:24.962
Just tell 'em it's none of their business.

04:27.632 --> 04:29.233
It's none of your business.

04:29.301 --> 04:31.502
You're obviously back together.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.571
No, we're not back together.

04:33.638 --> 04:36.974
We... are... somewhere, um, in between.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.977
You're in the middle.
Your favorite place to meet.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.712
Why don't we talk about
why your client is flying us

04:41.780 --> 04:43.080
on a private jet to Tahoe?

04:43.148 --> 04:45.683
My client is trying
to build a hotel-casino

04:45.751 --> 04:48.085
on the state border
between California and Nevada.

04:48.153 --> 04:50.788
- Ooh, what the world needs now.
- Is more hotel-casinos.

04:50.856 --> 04:54.291
<i>But...</i> a jurisdictional dispute
between state agencies

04:54.359 --> 04:56.427
is holding up construction
and costing my client

04:56.495 --> 04:58.863
100 grand a day.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.998
- And where do I come in?
- I need a special master.

05:01.066 --> 05:02.466
Well, try Craigslist.

05:02.534 --> 05:03.901
I've heard they have a personals section.

05:03.969 --> 05:06.871
Ha ho! A special master is...

05:06.938 --> 05:08.472
I know, I know. A judge in absentia.

05:08.540 --> 05:10.174
Blah, blah, blah. I went to law school.

05:10.242 --> 05:11.709
Well, don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

05:11.777 --> 05:14.245
Anyway, I went to a federal judge who,

05:14.312 --> 05:17.615
based on your stellar
reputation as a mediator,

05:17.682 --> 05:20.251
got you appointed as a Magistrate.

05:20.318 --> 05:21.552
Which means <i>you</i> rule.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.554
You don't have to meet in the middle.

05:23.622 --> 05:28.125
You decide which agency...
gets the crime scene.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.796
Crime scene?

05:31.863 --> 05:33.330
Potential crime scene.

05:33.398 --> 05:35.933
Why is it a potential crime scene?

05:36.001 --> 05:38.769
Cause of death
is yet to be determined, it's...

05:38.837 --> 05:40.204
There's a body?

05:40.272 --> 05:42.807
More like bones.
They've been there a while.

05:42.874 --> 05:44.875
And the state agencies are...

05:44.943 --> 05:46.644
- Police departments.
- Police departments.

05:46.711 --> 05:48.979
I don't do murder.

05:49.047 --> 05:51.415
Good! Then you won't kill me.

06:07.833 --> 06:11.168
- You must be the lawyer.
- Guilty as charged.

06:11.236 --> 06:13.437
Ben Grogan, attorney for the developer.

06:13.505 --> 06:15.806
And this is Ms. Reed.

06:15.874 --> 06:19.677
But she's sensitive about the "l" word.

06:21.646 --> 06:22.847
I'm a mediator.

06:22.914 --> 06:24.715
Detective Smith from California.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.684
Kate Reed.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.052
Detective Nunez.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.553
This is my partner, Detective Cedeno.

06:29.621 --> 06:31.188
- Hi.
- Nevada.

06:31.256 --> 06:32.623
It's very nice to meet you all.

06:32.691 --> 06:34.925
Look, just forget about
all that special...

06:34.993 --> 06:36.627
master business.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.028
I'm really here to broker an agreement

06:38.096 --> 06:39.897
that we can all live with.

06:39.965 --> 06:42.066
Actually, that's not why she's here.

06:42.134 --> 06:45.202
She's not here to "broker,"
she's here to decide.

06:45.270 --> 06:47.104
You're the decider.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.140
My men arrived here first,

06:49.207 --> 06:51.842
which automatically
gives California jurisdiction.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.911
Not over a Nevada missing persons case.

06:53.979 --> 06:55.813
Missing persons?

06:55.881 --> 06:57.314
We found a wallet.

06:57.382 --> 06:59.717
The victim appears to be Carmen Cedeno,

06:59.784 --> 07:01.385
a 16-year-old girl
who went missing in '06.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.787
And they wouldn't let Nevada
police question the main suspect

07:03.855 --> 07:05.756
in her disappearance.

07:05.824 --> 07:08.025
- Why not?
- He was a California resident.

07:08.093 --> 07:09.994
- And they protected him.
- 'Cause he was a minor.

07:10.061 --> 07:11.362
And his daddy was rich.

07:11.429 --> 07:13.097
What the hell is he doing on this case?

07:13.165 --> 07:14.698
He has a right to be here.

07:14.766 --> 07:16.500
Well, he can't be objective.

07:16.568 --> 07:18.736
Uh, why not?

07:18.803 --> 07:20.905
Oh, you wanna tell her... or should I?

07:20.972 --> 07:25.476
The victim, Carmen Cedeno...

07:25.544 --> 07:28.779
was Detective Cedeno's sister.

07:28.847 --> 07:31.282
Oh, sir...

07:31.349 --> 07:33.717
I'm so sorry.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.986
Which is just another reason
why California

07:36.054 --> 07:37.621
should have custody of this case.

07:37.689 --> 07:40.157
So Neil Matthews can make sure
they destroy any evidence

07:40.225 --> 07:41.525
- implicating his son.
- You're out of line!

07:41.593 --> 07:42.960
Okay, sidebar!

07:43.028 --> 07:44.395
Everyone back to their corners

07:44.462 --> 07:46.363
while I confer with my colleague.

07:46.431 --> 07:48.299
So wow. This is complicated,

07:48.366 --> 07:51.735
and I can see how you might get
emotionally invested

07:51.803 --> 07:52.970
in the whole "justice for all" angle,

07:53.038 --> 07:54.738
but this is a criminal investigation

07:54.806 --> 07:56.407
best left to the experts.

07:56.474 --> 07:58.509
And your job, as special master,

07:58.577 --> 07:59.977
is just to get the ball rolling.

08:00.045 --> 08:02.546
So your client can stop
bleeding 100 grand a day.

08:02.614 --> 08:03.814
- Yeah.
- No!

08:03.882 --> 08:05.416
If you wanted simple,

08:05.483 --> 08:08.686
you should've just left me at
home and brought a coin to flip.

08:08.753 --> 08:11.088
- Heads or tails?
- All right, you know what?

08:11.156 --> 08:13.924
I am not gonna pick a side... <i>any</i> side!

08:13.992 --> 08:15.960
- I am gonna keep your quarter.
- Excuse me.

08:16.027 --> 08:17.328
Is is true what they're saying
on the news?

08:17.395 --> 08:18.762
Did you find Carmen?

08:18.830 --> 08:20.231
Oh, sir, you know what, I'm really sorry,

08:20.298 --> 08:21.665
- but you do have to get behind...
- No, I understand that.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.334
- You have no right to be here!
- Hey!

08:23.401 --> 08:24.568
That's him! He killed my sister!

08:24.636 --> 08:25.869
What is going on?

08:25.937 --> 08:29.506
Your daddy can't save you now, Jacob!

08:32.010 --> 08:33.577
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

Sync and corrections by atrn97g

08:45.594 --> 08:48.162
Let me assure you that
we will not tolerate hate crimes

08:48.230 --> 08:50.064
in San Francisco.

08:50.131 --> 08:51.732
And we will convict Joseph Craig

08:51.800 --> 08:53.300
for the beating of David Kwan.

08:53.368 --> 08:56.537
Hmm. I see "Mr. Photo Op" is at it again.

08:56.605 --> 08:57.771
Mm-hmm.

08:57.839 --> 08:59.673
Isn't most of your case circumstantial?

08:59.741 --> 09:01.141
Actually, we have a witness.

09:01.209 --> 09:03.744
The defendant's own cousin will testify

09:03.812 --> 09:06.180
that Craig bragged about putting
the victim into a coma.

09:06.248 --> 09:08.549
He's taking a big chance
trying this case himself.

09:08.617 --> 09:10.084
No, it's a slam dunk.

09:10.151 --> 09:13.187
And it's perfectly timed
to boost his approval rating.

09:13.255 --> 09:15.923
You know, a lot can happen
between now and the election.

09:15.991 --> 09:17.891
So you just need to stay focused.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.227
Mm-hmm.

09:20.295 --> 09:23.530
Are we talking about this morning?

09:23.598 --> 09:26.800
- That's none of my business.
- True.

09:26.868 --> 09:29.770
However, as legal counsel
to your campaign...

09:29.838 --> 09:31.572
You should be happy
that you caught me with Kate,

09:31.640 --> 09:32.740
not a hooker.

09:34.509 --> 09:37.077
I want you to be the next D.A.

09:37.145 --> 09:39.813
Lauren Reed.

09:39.881 --> 09:41.282
Mr. D.A.

09:41.349 --> 09:42.483
And don't you forget it. Justin.

09:42.550 --> 09:43.984
Hmm.

09:44.052 --> 09:46.453
I want you to take over
the David Kwan beating trial...

09:46.521 --> 09:48.289
starting tomorrow.

09:48.356 --> 09:49.423
Wait, why?

09:49.491 --> 09:51.859
Well, because I said so.

09:51.926 --> 09:56.597
Don't blow it.

09:56.665 --> 09:58.732
There's gotta be a problem
with that witness.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.134
Yeah.

10:00.201 --> 10:01.302
We need to figure out what it is

10:01.369 --> 10:03.570
- before the defense does, huh?
- Yeah.

10:03.638 --> 10:07.608
Okay, so six years ago,
you found Carmen's car parked

10:07.676 --> 10:09.176
at the bottom of one of the hiking trails.

10:09.244 --> 10:10.844
- That's right.
- You searched the mountains?

10:10.912 --> 10:12.179
We all did...

10:12.247 --> 10:14.181
California and Nevada...

10:14.249 --> 10:15.683
but we didn't find her.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.251
How is that possible?

10:17.319 --> 10:19.119
Well, they searched the park
where Chandra Levy went missing.

10:19.187 --> 10:21.155
Didn't find her body until a year later

10:21.222 --> 10:23.757
when some guy stumbled
across her, looking for turtles.

10:23.825 --> 10:25.492
- Turtles.
- Yeah.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.760
You can't make that stuff up.

10:26.828 --> 10:28.495
The ravine where we found her remains

10:28.563 --> 10:31.065
was pretty inaccessible
until your developer...

10:31.132 --> 10:33.133
started raping the forest.

10:33.201 --> 10:35.402
We prefer to think of it as creating jobs.

10:35.470 --> 10:37.738
So Jacob dumped the body
where we couldn't find her,

10:37.806 --> 10:39.206
and they protected him.

10:39.274 --> 10:40.841
There was no evidence of foul play.

10:40.909 --> 10:44.878
For all we knew, she ditched
her car and ran away from home.

10:44.946 --> 10:47.247
See, this is exactly
why we need a decider.

10:47.315 --> 10:48.949
There is no win-win here, Katie.

10:49.017 --> 10:50.384
Zip it before I hold you in contempt.

10:50.452 --> 10:52.753
Look, fellas, I'm really sorry.

10:52.821 --> 10:54.822
I don't mean to drag this out
any longer than necessary.

10:54.889 --> 10:56.990
It's just that I can't make a decision

10:57.058 --> 10:58.959
until after I've heard
both sides of the story.

10:59.027 --> 11:00.527
And that's including Jacob's.

11:00.595 --> 11:02.029
Well, his daddy won't let you talk to him.

11:02.097 --> 11:04.498
Well, his daddy doesn't have to know.

11:04.566 --> 11:07.101
She was so beautiful
it made your heart hurt.

11:07.168 --> 11:11.972
You know?

11:12.040 --> 11:14.808
I was recruited by a private high school

11:14.876 --> 11:17.578
on the California side of Tahoe
to play football,

11:17.645 --> 11:19.813
and uh, he was the starting quarterback.

11:19.881 --> 11:21.348
And were you friends?

11:21.416 --> 11:24.017
Yeah, we were best friends.
That's how I met Carmen.

11:24.085 --> 11:26.620
- Did he approve?
- I think so.

11:26.688 --> 11:27.888
He never said he didn't.

11:27.956 --> 11:29.723
Carmen was crazy about him.

11:29.791 --> 11:31.191
I was cool with it. His father freaked.

11:31.259 --> 11:33.260
Yeah, I was going to USC in the fall,

11:33.328 --> 11:35.996
and he didn't want me getting
serious with a girl from home.

11:36.064 --> 11:37.531
- A Latino girl...
- Mm-hmm.

11:37.599 --> 11:38.932
From the wrong side of Tahoe.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.401
And how did she feel about that?

11:40.468 --> 11:43.203
She was upset.

11:43.271 --> 11:44.838
But I mean, her parents
didn't approve of us either.

11:44.906 --> 11:46.840
Okay, so then what happened?

11:46.908 --> 11:49.209
- Stopped seeing each other.
- Completely?

11:49.277 --> 11:50.677
In public.

11:50.745 --> 11:52.012
They were still sneaking around though.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.149
And you think that Jacob was with Carmen

11:55.216 --> 11:56.683
the day that she disappeared.

11:56.751 --> 11:58.519
What else would she have been
doing up in those mountains?

11:58.586 --> 11:59.953
They're hiking trails.

12:00.021 --> 12:02.256
She wasn't hiking.

12:02.323 --> 12:03.757
She was with him.

12:03.825 --> 12:05.092
That's why the California police

12:05.160 --> 12:08.095
wouldn't let Nevada P.D. question Jacob.

12:08.163 --> 12:11.331
Neil Matthews paid them off
to protect his son

12:11.399 --> 12:13.133
because he killed Carmen.

12:13.201 --> 12:16.670
But if he loved her,
why would he hurt her?

12:16.738 --> 12:18.272
Carmen was upset

12:18.339 --> 12:20.007
because Jacob wouldn't
stand up to his dad.

12:20.074 --> 12:23.210
Maybe she called him a coward.
Maybe... maybe he snapped.

12:23.278 --> 12:25.579
Okay, all I know
is that he lied back then,

12:25.647 --> 12:27.915
and he's lying now.

12:27.982 --> 12:31.452
- Did you kill Carmen Cedeno?
- No.

12:31.519 --> 12:33.053
Look, I loved Carmen.

12:33.121 --> 12:35.322
Were you with her
the day that she disappeared?

12:35.390 --> 12:36.557
Uh, no.

12:36.624 --> 12:38.892
I hadn't seen her since we broke up.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.428
I'm Neil Matthews, Jacob's father.

12:41.496 --> 12:42.763
I called him.

12:42.831 --> 12:44.531
It's okay, dad.

12:44.599 --> 12:46.366
No! It's not.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.935
The Nevada P.D. is looking for any reason

12:48.002 --> 12:49.670
to string you up from the nearest tree.

12:49.737 --> 12:52.172
Mr. Matthews, I am not here
to investigate this case.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.507
Hello.

12:53.575 --> 12:54.775
I am simply here
to award the investigation

12:54.843 --> 12:55.976
to the proper authorities.

12:56.044 --> 12:57.578
Thank you.

12:57.645 --> 12:59.079
Who is he?

12:59.147 --> 13:00.714
He is irrelevant.

13:00.782 --> 13:02.316
Wow.

13:02.383 --> 13:04.685
Sir, I'm just trying to hear
both sides of the story.

13:06.354 --> 13:07.754
Well, I'll tell you the story.

13:07.822 --> 13:10.624
They harassed my son.
They called him a murderer.

13:10.692 --> 13:12.726
They threw rocks through our windows.

13:12.794 --> 13:14.027
And now that they found a body,

13:14.095 --> 13:16.029
I believe that
they'd fabricate the evidence

13:16.097 --> 13:17.297
to prove themselves right.

13:17.365 --> 13:19.366
Please don't let that happen.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.935
Don't give them the power
to send an innocent young man

13:22.003 --> 13:24.538
to prison for the rest of his life.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.314
The father's got a point.

13:34.382 --> 13:35.682
Nevada's ready to hang that boy.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.150
Yeah, and meanwhile,

13:37.218 --> 13:38.952
the California police
are tipping the dad off.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.153
You know, they're hiding something.

13:40.221 --> 13:42.022
Probably that he killed the girl.

13:42.090 --> 13:44.625
I just... I don't think that.

13:44.692 --> 13:46.260
He loved her.

13:46.327 --> 13:49.329
Yeah, and people never kill
the people that they love.

13:49.397 --> 13:51.598
Hey, I just... I have a feeling in my gut.

13:51.666 --> 13:53.300
Well, we skipped lunch. Maybe it's hunger.

13:53.368 --> 13:54.801
All right, all right.

13:54.869 --> 13:56.737
Our first priority is to the victim.

13:56.804 --> 13:58.205
- Right?
- Yes.

13:58.273 --> 14:00.607
- He's losing 100 grand a day.
- No! Carmen Cedeno.

14:00.675 --> 14:02.209
- Oh, that victim.
- Is this funny to you?

14:02.277 --> 14:04.311
No! It is tragic.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.713
But... there's no win-win here, Kate.

14:06.781 --> 14:08.982
Each side has an agenda
and you have to pick one.

14:09.050 --> 14:12.352
- Why do I have to pick one?
- Because you can't pick both.

14:12.420 --> 14:14.187
Why not? I'm the special master.

14:14.255 --> 14:17.591
- Kate, what are you doing?
- Guys...

14:17.659 --> 14:19.660
if there's one thing
that we can all agree on

14:19.727 --> 14:21.962
it's that Carmen cannot be
out there a moment longer.

14:22.030 --> 14:23.497
Right?

14:23.565 --> 14:25.766
Okay, so then you're both gonna
process the scene jointly

14:25.833 --> 14:27.868
until I decide who gets the case.

14:27.936 --> 14:30.137
Now, I am also gonna bring in
a medical examiner

14:30.204 --> 14:31.572
to do the autopsy.

14:31.639 --> 14:33.674
Emilio, if this is too difficult for you...

14:33.741 --> 14:34.942
I'm fine.

14:35.009 --> 14:36.543
We're losing daylight.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.579
Well, then bring in some lights.

14:38.646 --> 14:41.014
Oh, and I am gonna need
the original case files

14:41.082 --> 14:44.384
from both police departments
sent to me at, um...

14:44.452 --> 14:46.753
where are we staying tonight?

14:50.725 --> 14:53.994
How did I not anticipate
that you would complicate

14:54.062 --> 14:56.129
this otherwise simple task?

14:56.197 --> 14:58.498
Good question, Benedict.

14:58.566 --> 14:59.933
You know, there are plenty of mediators

15:00.001 --> 15:01.935
in all of San Francisco
that would be more than happy

15:02.003 --> 15:04.771
to flip your coin.

15:04.839 --> 15:06.506
Mm-hmm.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.075
Why me?

15:08.142 --> 15:09.443
I guess I was foolish enough to assume

15:09.510 --> 15:11.778
that you might do me a solid.

15:11.846 --> 15:16.149
Or maybe this was just
an excuse to whisk me away

15:16.217 --> 15:18.385
to your client's pied-a-terre
and rob me of my virtue.

15:18.453 --> 15:20.187
Please.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.823
You haven't had your virtue
since you were, what...

15:22.890 --> 15:25.959
16?

15:26.027 --> 15:28.028
Younger.

15:28.096 --> 15:30.764
Older!

15:35.370 --> 15:38.605
How many, uh, bedrooms
does your client have?

15:38.673 --> 15:41.174
I assure you you are perfectly safe.

15:41.242 --> 15:42.576
Only if there's a lock on the door.

15:42.644 --> 15:43.744
Wow.

15:43.811 --> 15:45.178
Look at the view.

15:45.246 --> 15:49.616
- Oh, and hey, there's a hot tub.
- Of course there is.

15:49.684 --> 15:51.518
Oh, this is interesting.

15:51.586 --> 15:54.554
Jacob made a statement
to the California P.D.

15:54.622 --> 15:56.423
right after Carmen disappeared.

15:56.491 --> 15:58.925
But because he was a minor and
there wasn't a parent present,

15:58.993 --> 16:00.127
his father had it sealed.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.928
Which means...

16:01.996 --> 16:04.531
the Nevada P.D. doesn't know about this.

16:04.599 --> 16:08.068
There's only one reason
to seal a statement.

16:08.136 --> 16:09.770
What he told them is incriminating.

16:09.837 --> 16:12.239
Or it could be used
to incriminate him by people

16:12.306 --> 16:14.374
who just assumed
that he was already guilty.

16:14.442 --> 16:16.209
Do you always trust your gut feelings?

16:16.277 --> 16:17.878
Yes.

16:17.945 --> 16:19.479
And I can usually tell
when people are lying to me.

16:22.817 --> 16:25.352
Katherine Reed.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.787
Yes.

16:26.854 --> 16:28.655
Don't do anything. We'll be right there.

16:28.723 --> 16:30.691
What's up?

16:30.758 --> 16:33.226
They found something.

16:42.070 --> 16:44.137
So they found this jacket under the body?

16:44.205 --> 16:46.139
No one could've planted it.

16:46.207 --> 16:47.708
We'll do carbon dating,

16:47.775 --> 16:51.178
but it looks like it's been
out here as long as she has.

16:51.245 --> 16:53.380
Thank you.

16:53.448 --> 16:54.648
So...

16:54.716 --> 16:56.016
what's your gut telling you now?

16:56.084 --> 16:59.119
Ooh, uh, well, it's telling me that...

16:59.187 --> 17:00.921
Jacob would've been
pretty stupid to kill her

17:00.988 --> 17:02.723
and then leave his jacket behind.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.891
- Maybe he panicked.
- <i>And...</i>

17:04.959 --> 17:07.127
it doesn't prove that he was
with her that day.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.196
I mean, he could've given her
his jacket at any time.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.199
No, he couldn't.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.968
That was our division championship jacket.

17:15.036 --> 17:17.738
We got them the morning of
the day that Carmen disappeared.

17:17.805 --> 17:19.439
Which does prove that Jacob was with her.

17:19.507 --> 17:22.075
And the only reason
he would've lied about it

17:22.143 --> 17:25.045
is because he killed her.

17:25.113 --> 17:27.681
So now tell me he didn't do it.

17:30.978 --> 17:32.479
What happened to Mr. Davidson?

17:32.546 --> 17:35.048
He asked me to take over
this phase of the trial.

17:35.116 --> 17:37.350
Why?

17:37.418 --> 17:39.719
'Cause he trusts me. And you can too.

17:39.787 --> 17:41.955
What about her?
Does she work for the D.A.?

17:42.023 --> 17:43.390
Uh, no.

17:43.457 --> 17:45.692
Ms. Reed is a special outside
consultant of the jury.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.160
She's on our side.

17:47.228 --> 17:48.762
Is there a problem with the jury?

17:48.829 --> 17:50.263
Not at all.

17:50.331 --> 17:51.564
It's just that the defense
is probably gonna try

17:51.632 --> 17:52.966
to convince them that you're lying,

17:53.034 --> 17:54.901
that your cousin never told you
that he beat David Kwan

17:54.969 --> 17:56.536
after the concert.

17:56.604 --> 17:59.439
Yeah, well, I wish he hadn't.
But he put that guy in a coma.

17:59.507 --> 18:02.008
That took a lot of guts
to come forward, Arnel.

18:02.076 --> 18:05.011
- Personally, you're my hero.
- That's right.

18:05.079 --> 18:06.813
We wanna protect you on that stand.

18:06.881 --> 18:08.548
So if there's anything...

18:08.616 --> 18:10.083
anything at all you can think of,

18:10.151 --> 18:13.586
true or false... that the defense
might try to use against you...

18:13.654 --> 18:15.155
we need to know.

18:15.222 --> 18:18.925
This is no time for secrets.
Anything at all.

18:18.993 --> 18:22.162
Um, yeah. Yeah, there might...

18:22.229 --> 18:24.330
there might be one thing.

18:26.567 --> 18:31.771
You can tell us.

18:31.839 --> 18:35.241
I... hooked up with Angela.

18:35.309 --> 18:36.843
Who's Angela?

18:36.911 --> 18:40.880
Joseph's wife.

18:40.948 --> 18:42.849
You had sex with your cousin's wife?

18:42.917 --> 18:45.485
Just a few times.

18:45.553 --> 18:47.153
And nobody's knows about it,
especially Joseph.

18:47.221 --> 18:50.323
And how can you be sure?

18:50.391 --> 18:52.525
Because if he knew about it,
then we would both be dead.

18:56.097 --> 18:59.132
Arnel, could you excuse us a minute?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.467
Excuse me.

19:06.340 --> 19:07.874
Tell me this isn't happening.

19:07.942 --> 19:10.176
- Well, it was only a few times.
- Yeah.

19:10.244 --> 19:13.346
I have a feeling Angela told.

19:13.414 --> 19:15.215
Yeah, to help her husband's defense.

19:15.282 --> 19:17.584
And Davidson found out about it.

19:17.651 --> 19:19.385
Be honest with me here.

19:19.453 --> 19:22.188
Scale of one to ten, how screwed am I?

19:22.256 --> 19:24.124
11.

19:27.962 --> 19:30.196
This jacket gives us probable cause

19:30.264 --> 19:31.531
to arrest Jacob Matthews.

19:31.599 --> 19:33.766
For what? Lying?

19:33.834 --> 19:35.502
He's not even under oath.

19:35.569 --> 19:37.403
And until we determine <i>how</i> Carmen died,

19:37.471 --> 19:39.205
we're not even sure
that a crime was committed.

19:39.273 --> 19:40.940
Is Matthews paying you too?

19:41.008 --> 19:42.675
How much does it cost
to buy a special master?

19:42.743 --> 19:44.644
How much would you like
a punch in the face?

19:44.712 --> 19:45.812
Okay, hey. No punching.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.582
- Can I have a word?
- Yes.

19:49.650 --> 19:52.218
Will you try to act professional?

19:57.191 --> 19:59.759
Look, I realize everyone thinks

19:59.827 --> 20:01.928
Jacob's dad owns the world around here.

20:01.996 --> 20:04.497
But he doesn't own me.

20:04.565 --> 20:07.500
He's chartered a private plane to Mexico.

20:07.568 --> 20:10.069
He's trying to get his son
out of the country.

20:10.137 --> 20:12.071
- Leaving when?
- Tonight.

20:12.139 --> 20:15.575
Time to act, Katie.

20:17.178 --> 20:19.846
What do you want me to do?

20:19.914 --> 20:22.048
Nothing.

20:22.116 --> 20:23.449
Davidson!

20:26.287 --> 20:28.188
Arnel had an affair
with his cousin's wife.

20:28.255 --> 20:30.757
Oh, shame on him.

20:30.824 --> 20:32.992
No, the shame's all on you
for knowing that

20:33.060 --> 20:36.930
and dumping this case
in my lap for political reasons.

20:36.997 --> 20:38.431
Politics is a shameless business.

20:38.499 --> 20:39.666
Well, it doesn't always have to be.

20:39.733 --> 20:41.534
Well, it always will be.

20:41.602 --> 20:43.803
Because it all comes down
to self-preservation.

20:43.871 --> 20:46.105
No, it all comes down to public service.

20:46.173 --> 20:47.941
The people elected you
to put their interests

20:48.008 --> 20:49.242
ahead of your own.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.544
Oh, the people, huh?

20:51.612 --> 20:53.246
Well, they might pretend
to care about doing

20:53.314 --> 20:55.748
"what's right for all of San Francisco,"

20:55.816 --> 20:57.617
but when it comes down to it
they want the guy

20:57.685 --> 20:59.786
that can guarantee what's right for them.

20:59.853 --> 21:01.854
Well, people don't wanna see
Joseph Craig walk.

21:01.922 --> 21:03.323
But if I have to put Arnel on the stand,

21:03.390 --> 21:04.924
that is exactly what's gonna happen.

21:04.992 --> 21:06.492
We have to offer a plea on this one.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.894
No way.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.163
I'd rather lose than offer Craig
a slap on the wrist.

21:10.231 --> 21:12.131
No, you'd rather I lose.

21:12.199 --> 21:13.633
Yeah.

21:13.701 --> 21:15.435
Yeah, because, see, that's my prerogative.

21:15.502 --> 21:17.370
And you work for me.

21:17.438 --> 21:20.340
Did it never occur to you
that it's sheer folly

21:20.407 --> 21:22.742
to run against your boss?

21:29.683 --> 21:32.452
Hey!

21:35.723 --> 21:37.156
Where do you think you're running off to?

21:37.224 --> 21:39.259
We're taking a vacation.

21:39.326 --> 21:41.160
Well, I really hope
you have travel insurance,

21:41.228 --> 21:42.495
because I'm gonna need you to stick around

21:42.563 --> 21:44.931
until I decide who gets the case.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.833
You have no grounds to detain us.

21:46.900 --> 21:49.469
They found his jacket on Carmen's body.

21:49.536 --> 21:50.803
But I guess you already knew that.

21:50.871 --> 21:52.672
My son is innocent.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.007
Well, then why are you running?

21:54.074 --> 21:56.609
- She's right.
- Jacob, just get on the...

21:56.677 --> 21:58.611
No! Jacob... Jacob, listen to me.

21:58.679 --> 22:03.249
You are not 17 any more, okay?
You are a grown man.

22:03.317 --> 22:06.486
You can do whatever you wanna do.

22:06.553 --> 22:08.921
And you wanna tell the truth.
I know you do.

22:08.989 --> 22:10.990
That's enough. Jacob, now.

22:11.058 --> 22:13.293
No! They found her.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.827
There's no reason to lie anymore.

22:14.895 --> 22:17.230
What... and you think the truth
is gonna keep you out of jail?!

22:17.298 --> 22:19.399
Just because I'm not in jail
does not mean that I'm free.

22:19.466 --> 22:21.401
We know that you were with her
the day that she disappeared.

22:21.468 --> 22:23.403
Will you tell us what happened?

22:23.470 --> 22:25.872
I'll tell you what happened, but not here.

22:25.939 --> 22:28.741
- Okay.
- Where, on a plane to Mexico?

22:28.809 --> 22:30.943
Up in the mountains.
Where we met that day.

22:31.011 --> 22:32.011
There's something I've got to show you,

22:32.079 --> 22:33.046
but please just let it be you.

22:33.113 --> 22:35.114
Yes, just me, just me. I promise.

22:35.182 --> 22:36.382
What is going on?

22:38.018 --> 22:39.686
What?

22:39.753 --> 22:42.055
- You told them?
- I had to.

22:42.122 --> 22:43.456
Jacob Matthews, you are under arrest

22:43.524 --> 22:44.824
- for the murder of Carmen Cedeno.
- Murder?

22:44.892 --> 22:46.726
- On what grounds?
- Murder?

22:46.794 --> 22:48.528
The M.E. says it looks like
Carmen's skull was fractured

22:48.595 --> 22:50.697
by blunt force trauma.

22:50.764 --> 22:53.433
Look, I didn't do it.
Look, I swear, I didn't do it!

22:53.500 --> 22:54.634
Don't say anything until
I get you a lawyer!

22:54.702 --> 22:56.002
You have to trust me!

23:06.054 --> 23:09.489
My son has no chance
at a fair trial in Nevada.

23:09.557 --> 23:11.592
You just sent an innocent
young man to jail,

23:11.659 --> 23:15.195
maybe for the rest of his life.

23:15.263 --> 23:16.396
I hope you can live with that.

23:24.005 --> 23:26.006
You did the right thing.

23:26.074 --> 23:28.475
Oh, God, I wish I could see that statement

23:28.543 --> 23:30.243
Jacob made to the California police.

23:30.311 --> 23:32.145
And what would that prove?

23:32.213 --> 23:33.814
Well, that he tried to tell the truth,

23:33.881 --> 23:35.248
but his father wouldn't let him.

23:35.316 --> 23:37.284
I'm more curious about
what he wants to show you

23:37.352 --> 23:39.019
up in the mountains.

23:39.087 --> 23:40.787
Maybe it was the rock he used
to crush Carmen's skull.

23:40.855 --> 23:44.024
Okay, so, you think he did it?

23:44.092 --> 23:45.125
Yeah.

23:45.193 --> 23:48.629
But, I am cynical.

23:48.696 --> 23:50.430
No, you're not.

23:50.498 --> 23:53.900
You're not that cynical.

23:53.968 --> 23:55.469
- Says who?
- Leo.

23:59.974 --> 24:01.541
What did Leo tell you?

24:01.609 --> 24:03.710
No, no, no. It's... just forget it.

24:03.778 --> 24:05.479
- It... okay.
- Okay, yeah, forget it.

24:05.546 --> 24:07.914
Okay, so, I know that you went
to Leo's looking for me

24:07.982 --> 24:10.884
the night that I stood you up.

24:10.952 --> 24:15.322
- I was drunk.
- No.

24:15.390 --> 24:18.191
You were upset.

24:18.259 --> 24:20.127
And, Ben, I'm sorry.

24:20.194 --> 24:21.662
I am so sorry.

24:21.729 --> 24:26.033
I just... I... I didn't think
that you cared that much.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.301
I didn't.

24:28.369 --> 24:30.103
It was... an ego thing.

24:30.171 --> 24:31.538
I don't get stood up.

24:31.606 --> 24:36.376
That's all it was.

24:36.444 --> 24:40.447
Are you done with me?

24:40.515 --> 24:43.750
No, um... you know what?

24:43.818 --> 24:44.985
Can I get a ride to the station?

24:45.053 --> 24:45.886
I want to make sure Jacob gets there and...

24:45.953 --> 24:47.254
I can take you.

24:47.321 --> 24:50.090
It's all right.

24:50.158 --> 24:51.425
I'll see you later.

25:13.848 --> 25:15.315
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.551
Talk about the cat that
ate the canary, huh?

25:21.723 --> 25:22.923
I'm calling Arnel to the stand.

25:22.990 --> 25:25.092
They're gonna tear him apart.

25:25.159 --> 25:27.294
Not if I do it first.

25:31.199 --> 25:32.432
I'll keep an eye on the jury.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.969
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

25:49.650 --> 25:50.717
Morning!

25:50.785 --> 25:52.786
Wasn't sure how you liked your eggs,

25:52.854 --> 25:54.888
and so I scrambled them.

25:54.956 --> 25:56.389
I would have made quiche
if I had more time.

25:56.457 --> 25:57.724
Quiche?

25:57.792 --> 26:00.293
Yes. Real men do eat quiche.

26:00.361 --> 26:02.362
And...

26:02.430 --> 26:06.933
drink the occasional appletini.

26:21.048 --> 26:22.015
What's that?

26:22.083 --> 26:24.317
That is a fax.

26:24.385 --> 26:26.486
Short for facsimile.

26:26.554 --> 26:29.356
I found it in the time machine
next to the pong game.

26:29.423 --> 26:31.825
The sealed statement of one Jacob Matthews

26:31.893 --> 26:34.494
given to the California police
six years ago,

26:34.562 --> 26:38.865
the day after Carmen went missing.

26:38.933 --> 26:40.700
How did you get this?

26:40.768 --> 26:42.135
I asked for it.

26:42.203 --> 26:43.670
You're the special master.

26:43.738 --> 26:46.173
You have the authority to see anything

26:46.240 --> 26:49.075
that is pertinent to the case.

26:49.143 --> 26:50.410
Mm.

26:50.478 --> 26:51.678
Can I share this?

26:51.746 --> 26:55.582
No, but you can vouch for what Jacob said.

26:55.650 --> 26:56.716
Or what he didn't say.

26:56.784 --> 26:58.285
You don't have to read it.

26:58.352 --> 27:02.889
Yeah, I do.

27:09.230 --> 27:10.197
Fried.

27:10.264 --> 27:14.868
Over-easy.

27:14.936 --> 27:17.537
That's how I like my eggs.

27:22.243 --> 27:23.476
Arnel, did your cousin,

27:23.544 --> 27:25.412
Joseph Craig, tell you
that he beat David Kwan?

27:25.479 --> 27:26.680
Yes.

27:26.747 --> 27:29.749
Did he tell you why?

27:29.817 --> 27:32.085
Because he doesn't like asians.

27:32.153 --> 27:33.854
So, Joseph Craig is guilty
of a hate crime?

27:33.921 --> 27:35.155
Objection.

27:35.223 --> 27:37.457
The prosecution can't lead
his own witness.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.459
Withdrawn.

27:39.527 --> 27:43.029
Arnel, did you have sex
with your cousin's wife?

27:46.634 --> 27:47.767
Why... why are you asking me that?

27:47.835 --> 27:49.636
Well, I think the jury has a right

27:49.704 --> 27:51.304
to know if you have
any reason to be lying.

27:51.372 --> 27:52.939
Why... why are you doing this?

27:53.007 --> 27:54.407
Just answer the question, please.

27:54.475 --> 27:55.675
- No!
- Your Honor,

27:55.743 --> 27:57.410
permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

27:57.478 --> 27:59.479
Objection. Your Honor,

27:59.547 --> 28:01.615
the witness has fully cooperated
on the subject matter

28:01.682 --> 28:03.283
pertinent to this case.

28:03.351 --> 28:05.719
But not on matters affecting
his credibility, he hasn't.

28:05.786 --> 28:08.188
Permission granted.

28:08.256 --> 28:10.090
- You can continue, Mr. Patrick.
- Thank you.

28:10.157 --> 28:13.126
Arnel, did you have an affair
with the defendant's wife?

28:13.194 --> 28:16.897
You are under oath.

28:16.964 --> 28:19.699
Yes, but he was always cheating on Angela.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.368
- Objection, hearsay!
- Sustained.

28:21.435 --> 28:22.969
Are you lying, Arnel?

28:23.037 --> 28:24.671
Do you want to just get
Joseph out of the way

28:24.739 --> 28:26.940
- so you can be with Angela?
- No, I'm not lying.

28:27.008 --> 28:29.042
Well, you betrayed your cousin
with his own wife,

28:29.110 --> 28:30.577
why would I believe you?
Why should they believe you?

28:30.645 --> 28:32.245
Because I'm telling the truth.

28:32.313 --> 28:33.813
Arnel, are you afraid of your cousin?

28:33.881 --> 28:35.282
Yes.

28:35.349 --> 28:36.316
Then why would you come forward?

28:36.384 --> 28:37.851
Why would you tell the police

28:37.919 --> 28:40.086
what Joseph said he did to David Kwan?

28:40.154 --> 28:43.223
'Cause he was bragging about
it, like he was proud of it!

28:43.291 --> 28:45.492
Because he was laughing about
putting him into a coma,

28:45.559 --> 28:46.793
and then I told my mother,

28:46.861 --> 28:48.461
and our priest, and they told me

28:48.529 --> 28:52.365
that I... I... I had to...
I had to do the right thing,

28:52.433 --> 28:53.500
that's all I'm trying to do.

28:53.567 --> 28:56.770
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

28:56.837 --> 29:00.040
Okay.

29:00.107 --> 29:01.308
Thank you.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.109
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.882
Look, all I'm asking
is that you give Jacob

29:08.950 --> 29:10.216
a chance to tell his story.

29:10.284 --> 29:11.384
He isn't talking.

29:11.452 --> 29:13.053
But he'll talk to me.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.654
And as a matter of fact, he wants to do it

29:14.722 --> 29:16.756
where he and Carmen met that day.

29:16.824 --> 29:18.024
So he admitted he was with her.

29:18.092 --> 29:21.261
Emilio, he admitted it six years ago.

29:21.329 --> 29:22.862
He made a statement

29:22.930 --> 29:25.098
to the California police
right after she disappeared.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.233
But his father had it sealed,

29:27.301 --> 29:30.603
because he was afraid that
it would incriminate him.

29:30.671 --> 29:32.672
He was right to do it, too, with your side

29:32.740 --> 29:34.307
pulling out your torches and pitchforks.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.910
Final autopsy results will be in tomorrow.

29:36.978 --> 29:37.978
They'll tell us all we need to know.

29:38.045 --> 29:40.046
No, it won't.

29:40.114 --> 29:42.382
It won't tell you how she spent
the last few hours of her life.

29:42.450 --> 29:44.851
Only Jacob can do that.

29:44.919 --> 29:48.688
Emilio, he was your best friend, right?

29:48.756 --> 29:50.590
Okay, so don't you want
to hear what he has to say?

30:04.179 --> 30:05.613
Do you know, women who wear heels

30:05.681 --> 30:08.049
are 15 times more likely to get bunions.

30:08.117 --> 30:10.017
Well, I don't usually hike in them.

30:10.085 --> 30:11.586
Well, how do you think I feel?

30:11.653 --> 30:14.222
These are $1,500 loafers. - $1,500?

30:14.289 --> 30:16.324
They're reindeer leather.

30:16.391 --> 30:17.825
Reindeer?

30:17.893 --> 30:20.828
- What's wrong with that?
- Oh, everything.

30:20.896 --> 30:22.764
Ooh.

30:35.744 --> 30:38.012
This is it.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.014
Okay, you got us out here. Start talking.

30:40.082 --> 30:44.085
Carmen and I found this spot
the summer before.

30:44.153 --> 30:46.954
It's where we had our first kiss.

30:47.022 --> 30:50.458
It's a special place.

30:50.526 --> 30:52.960
Which is why we came here that day.

30:53.028 --> 30:55.363
Half a mile from where we found her body.

30:55.430 --> 30:56.998
- That's all I need to hear.
- Can you, please,

30:57.065 --> 30:59.033
just hear him out.

30:59.101 --> 31:00.668
Let's just cut to the chase, all right?

31:00.736 --> 31:02.203
We wanted to be together,

31:02.271 --> 31:04.472
but our parents were breaking us up.

31:04.540 --> 31:07.942
So we came here to get married.

31:08.010 --> 31:11.746
It wasn't legal, but...

31:11.814 --> 31:12.980
God doesn't care if you have
a marriage license,

31:13.048 --> 31:15.349
as long as you love each other.

31:15.417 --> 31:18.719
We said our vows, and...

31:18.787 --> 31:20.121
we promised when we turned 18

31:20.189 --> 31:23.224
we'd run away and do it for real.

31:23.292 --> 31:26.828
Never got the chance, though.

31:26.895 --> 31:29.530
How do we know you're not making this up?

31:29.598 --> 31:32.633
That's why I brought you here.

31:32.701 --> 31:34.202
To show you.

31:42.244 --> 31:45.079
Here.

31:45.147 --> 31:47.915
You've got to see this.

31:53.522 --> 31:56.490
He could have carved
that later as an alibi.

31:56.558 --> 31:58.326
Okay, I gave her a ring on a chain,

31:58.393 --> 32:00.494
so your parents wouldn't see it.

32:00.562 --> 32:01.629
She was wearing it around her neck

32:01.697 --> 32:03.097
when we hiked back down to her car.

32:03.165 --> 32:05.032
So, then, you went down
the Nevada side with her?

32:05.100 --> 32:07.201
Yeah, the sun was going down.

32:07.269 --> 32:09.437
It was getting cold,
so I gave her my jacket.

32:09.504 --> 32:11.172
I saw her get in her car,
and she drove away.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.341
I saw her drive away.

32:13.408 --> 32:14.976
That was the last time I saw her.

32:15.043 --> 32:18.346
You know, that's exactly what
he told the California police

32:18.413 --> 32:20.681
- six years ago.
- So his lies are consistent.

32:20.749 --> 32:23.217
- So what?
- Why?

32:23.285 --> 32:24.418
Why would I kill her?

32:24.486 --> 32:26.520
Look, I loved Carmen.

32:26.588 --> 32:28.556
And you were my best friend!
How could you think

32:28.624 --> 32:29.857
that I would ever hurt her?

32:29.925 --> 32:32.927
You lied to me about
being with her that day.

32:32.995 --> 32:34.929
- Okay, I knew you were lying.
- Well, I was scared.

32:34.997 --> 32:37.098
And you never stood up for me.

32:37.165 --> 32:40.001
Not once!

32:40.068 --> 32:42.770
You know what?

32:42.838 --> 32:45.072
Lock me away for the rest of my life.

32:45.140 --> 32:46.540
- Do it. Just execute me.
- Jacob...

32:46.608 --> 32:47.875
No, I told the truth.

32:47.943 --> 32:50.811
If no one believes me, I'd rather be dead.

32:50.879 --> 32:55.449
Okay, we heard your story.

32:55.517 --> 32:57.818
Let's go.

32:57.886 --> 32:58.786
Can I just have a minute, please?

32:58.854 --> 33:00.855
Yes.

33:39.528 --> 33:41.996
I think you can count on some
of the female jurors

33:42.064 --> 33:43.864
to side with Arnel.

33:43.932 --> 33:46.367
Some is not enough.

33:46.435 --> 33:47.735
But, if you can get a hung jury,

33:47.803 --> 33:50.438
you can move to retry the case
after the election.

33:50.505 --> 33:53.174
So, delay defeat for political cover.

33:53.241 --> 33:54.842
Mm.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.544
Sounds like a signature Davidson move.

33:56.611 --> 33:59.914
Ah, speak of the devil.

33:59.982 --> 34:03.250
That was, uh, quite the Hail
Mary you threw in there today.

34:03.318 --> 34:05.586
I'd say it was more strategic than that,

34:05.654 --> 34:06.887
and artfully executed,

34:06.955 --> 34:08.956
- if I may say so myself.
- Thank you.

34:09.024 --> 34:10.190
Mm-hmm.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.260
You two are awfully cozy these days.

34:13.328 --> 34:15.596
How's your stepdaughter feel about that?

34:15.664 --> 34:17.331
First, her father, and now her ex-husband?

34:17.399 --> 34:19.166
You're such a slimeball, Davidson.

34:19.234 --> 34:20.668
Mea culpa.

34:20.735 --> 34:22.069
It's your lucky day.

34:22.137 --> 34:23.337
Defense wants to make a deal.

34:23.405 --> 34:24.371
No contest, two years.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.306
Take it.

34:26.375 --> 34:29.010
What if I don't want to take it?

34:29.077 --> 34:30.043
What if I want to try

34:30.112 --> 34:31.478
for a conviction instead?

34:31.545 --> 34:32.713
You'll crash and burn.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.748
Well, wasn't that the idea?

34:34.815 --> 34:38.985
This one's your prerogative, but...

34:39.054 --> 34:42.156
what's that smell?

34:42.224 --> 34:44.692
Oh, it's your campaign going up in smoke.

34:50.931 --> 34:52.199
Do you think he's right?

34:52.266 --> 34:53.934
At least he doesn't get off altogether.

34:54.002 --> 34:57.738
Justin, what if they find him
not guilty, and he walks?

34:57.806 --> 35:01.142
I know. You're right.

35:01.209 --> 35:02.543
You know what the hardest part
of my job is?

35:02.611 --> 35:04.011
It's the compromise.

35:04.079 --> 35:07.114
I'm so sick of always having
to settle for less.

35:07.182 --> 35:09.050
If I don't have the courage
of my own convictions,

35:09.117 --> 35:13.087
then I don't deserve to win.

35:13.155 --> 35:16.057
Then you better make
a killer of a closing argument.

35:20.962 --> 35:22.730
The M.E. called.

35:22.798 --> 35:25.633
He's gonna have an autopsy
report by the morning.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.767
Did he give you a preview?

35:26.835 --> 35:30.571
No, just that he didn't find

35:30.639 --> 35:32.506
any necklace around Carmen's neck.

35:32.574 --> 35:33.507
It's not looking good for Jacob.

35:33.575 --> 35:34.542
No, it's not.

35:34.609 --> 35:38.012
But I believe him.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.747
I believe that he was in love,

35:39.815 --> 35:44.051
I believe that they got married that day.

35:44.119 --> 35:46.454
- What's that?
- It's a rock.

35:46.521 --> 35:47.655
Found it up there today.

35:47.722 --> 35:52.893
It's sort of shaped like a heart.

35:52.961 --> 35:55.329
Do you think it's ever
possible to feel that way again?

35:55.397 --> 35:56.864
Like what?

35:56.932 --> 36:00.101
The way it feels when you fall
in love for the first time?

36:00.168 --> 36:01.435
Do you remember that?

36:01.503 --> 36:04.171
It just feels like this wave.

36:04.239 --> 36:09.543
Just washes over you,
but you're not afraid to drown.

36:09.611 --> 36:11.779
Wow.

36:11.847 --> 36:13.747
Oh, it was just so easy the first time.

36:13.815 --> 36:18.085
Love is never easy.

36:18.153 --> 36:22.990
You don't have to be 17,
you just have to be brave.

36:23.058 --> 36:27.761
I knew you couldn't just pick
a side and then fly home.

36:27.829 --> 36:30.831
I wanted to stay the night.

36:30.899 --> 36:34.135
Because I do care that much,

36:34.202 --> 36:38.372
and so do you.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.573
That's why you went back to Justin,

36:39.641 --> 36:42.943
because he's safe.

36:43.011 --> 36:48.349
And this you can't control, and
it scares the hell out of you.

36:48.416 --> 36:51.485
You want that wave.

36:55.056 --> 36:56.857
Uhh.

36:56.925 --> 37:02.396
"No strategy, no foreplay,
no negotiation."

37:04.466 --> 37:10.070
Just have to have the guts to dive in.

37:10.138 --> 37:13.007
Do you?

37:17.345 --> 37:18.879
Too late.

37:26.454 --> 37:32.459
Are we ready to begin?

37:32.527 --> 37:36.630
The deceased has been identified
as Carmen Cedeno, age 16.

37:36.698 --> 37:39.967
She suffered a broken ankle
and a compound skull fracture,

37:40.035 --> 37:41.869
indicating she twisted her ankle,

37:41.937 --> 37:43.637
and fell from a great height
into the ravine,

37:43.705 --> 37:46.173
where she struck her head against a rock.

37:46.241 --> 37:47.841
Death was instantaneous.

37:47.909 --> 37:50.311
There was no indication of foul play,

37:50.378 --> 37:53.480
therefore, manner of death
is ruled accidental.

37:59.020 --> 38:02.523
Also, there was an inquiry
about a necklace.

38:02.591 --> 38:03.924
We didn't find one around her neck,

38:03.992 --> 38:06.026
but in her pocket there was a ring

38:06.094 --> 38:09.763
and a chain with a broken clasp.

38:09.831 --> 38:10.798
That's how she died.

38:10.865 --> 38:12.600
She lost the ring,

38:12.667 --> 38:16.203
she went back looking for it,
she wandered off the trail,

38:16.271 --> 38:19.173
and then she never came back.

39:00.362 --> 39:02.529
Huh, what do you know?

39:02.597 --> 39:06.467
Justin got a guilty verdict
on the David Kwan beating trial.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.636
I thought Davidson was trying that case.

39:08.703 --> 39:09.737
So did I.

39:09.804 --> 39:11.939
- Good for him.
- Mm-hmm.

39:21.182 --> 39:22.416
"We'll be back by lunch."

39:22.484 --> 39:25.719
Yeah.

39:29.391 --> 39:33.494
I'm glad this is over.

39:33.561 --> 39:35.229
Good to get home.

39:53.815 --> 39:54.782
Uhh!

39:58.887 --> 40:00.688
Hey.

40:00.755 --> 40:02.890
Hi.

40:02.957 --> 40:04.458
Sorry, I should have called you.

40:04.526 --> 40:05.492
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.895
Come on in, come on in. Hey.

40:07.962 --> 40:11.799
Oh, I hear, um,
congratulations are in order.

40:11.866 --> 40:13.067
Well, thank you.

40:13.134 --> 40:15.569
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:15.637 --> 40:16.937
How was your trip?

40:17.005 --> 40:19.139
Uneventful.

40:19.207 --> 40:21.675
So, while you were gone,
I had an epiphany.

40:21.743 --> 40:24.278
Uh-ooh.

40:24.346 --> 40:25.879
I don't want us to just be.

40:25.947 --> 40:26.880
I want to make promises.

40:26.948 --> 40:28.749
I want to make plans.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.250
I don't want to settle
for anything less, you know?

40:30.318 --> 40:31.552
Justin...

40:31.619 --> 40:33.420
No, no, just hear me out on this, okay?

40:33.488 --> 40:35.656
We belong together, Kate.

40:35.724 --> 40:38.959
We're not the same people we used to be.

40:39.027 --> 40:40.127
We can win,

40:40.195 --> 40:45.632
if we both refuse to lose.

40:45.700 --> 40:49.203
You said I always get what I want, right?

40:49.270 --> 40:52.139
I want you.

40:56.644 --> 40:58.545
Okay.

40:58.613 --> 41:00.814
Okay.

41:00.882 --> 41:03.083
Yeah.
