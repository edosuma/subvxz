01:28.434 --> 01:31.734
Let go of my hair,
you little psychopath!

01:31.769 --> 01:34.000
Die, commie bimbo.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.400
Now, Bud, I thought
we talked about this before.

01:38.435 --> 01:40.000
What's that, Mom?

01:40.035 --> 01:42.000
Sneaking up
behind your sister,

01:42.035 --> 01:44.834
pulling her hair,
pretending to kill her.

01:44.869 --> 01:46.434
Remember the effect
it had on Grandma?

01:48.300 --> 01:50.234
Nobody likes it,
nobody thinks it's funny.

01:50.269 --> 01:51.767
So cut it out, okay?

01:51.802 --> 01:52.868
Sure, Mom.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.267
Now go to school.

01:56.602 --> 01:58.267
I hate you.

01:58.302 --> 01:59.300
Good.

02:00.601 --> 02:03.267
Hey, hon.
Anything going on?

02:03.302 --> 02:04.300
Nope.

02:05.934 --> 02:08.934
Sweetie, is this
your little cactus?

02:08.969 --> 02:10.267
Uh-huh.

02:10.301 --> 02:11.634
Any particular reason

02:11.669 --> 02:15.701
you put it where
the alarm clock used to be?

02:15.736 --> 02:20.234
I thought it would dress up
the room a little bit.

02:20.269 --> 02:22.167
Gee, I meant to tell
you to be careful

02:22.202 --> 02:24.367
before you slammed your hand
on the alarm this morning.

02:24.402 --> 02:25.534
Well, you didn't.

02:25.569 --> 02:26.667
Sorry.

02:26.702 --> 02:27.834
That's okay.

02:27.869 --> 02:30.701
I stopped the bleeding
with your slip.

02:32.634 --> 02:33.834
Where are the kids?

02:33.869 --> 02:35.133
They've left.

02:35.168 --> 02:38.601
By the way, Bud has
show and tell at school today.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.567
The subject is,
"What does daddy do?"

02:40.602 --> 02:42.033
So when you come home tonight,

02:42.068 --> 02:43.467
if there's a can
of beer missing,

02:43.502 --> 02:45.300
and you can't find
the remote control,

02:45.335 --> 02:46.734
that's where they are.

02:46.769 --> 02:49.267
I hope he brings
that stuff back tonight.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.934
The Bulls are playing on TV.

02:50.969 --> 02:53.200
Oh, my God.
You're kidding.

02:53.235 --> 02:56.701
<i>It's not as exciting as your
Cookin' with Clyde the Cajun,</i>

02:56.736 --> 02:59.901
but at least it gives me
a reason to come home.

02:59.936 --> 03:03.033
Al, do you have to leave
the refrigerator door open?

03:03.068 --> 03:05.200
I'm getting a draft.

03:05.235 --> 03:09.567
I'm sorry. Maybe I should look
for some food in the dishwasher.

03:10.901 --> 03:12.400
We have no juice.

03:12.435 --> 03:15.400
I didn't buy any.
I didn't have time.

03:15.435 --> 03:16.701
That happens.
I understand.

03:16.736 --> 03:21.267
You don't have a job
or anything, do you?

03:21.302 --> 03:24.267
Well, I do sandpaper the stains
out of your shirts

03:24.302 --> 03:25.734
and battle your socks
and underwear

03:25.769 --> 03:27.567
into the washing machine,

03:27.602 --> 03:30.133
but I guess that is more
of an adventure than a job.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.000
What has that got
to do with juice?

03:32.035 --> 03:34.367
Al, there's a store
on your way home from work.

03:34.402 --> 03:36.501
I'm sorry.
Why didn't I think of that?

03:36.536 --> 03:39.000
Sure. I don't mind
doing the shopping too.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.534
Anything else I can do
to make your life easier?

03:41.569 --> 03:43.434
You could shave
your back.

03:46.033 --> 03:49.033
Hey, that hair is there
for a reason.

03:49.068 --> 03:51.901
It keeps you off
of me at night.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.701
Al, let's not start.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.234
We were having
such a nice morning.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.634
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You're right.

03:58.669 --> 04:01.067
It's just that I got
a hard day ahead of me

04:01.102 --> 04:02.834
and nothing to eat
to get me going.

04:02.869 --> 04:05.300
I'm sorry, honey.
It's my fault.

04:05.335 --> 04:09.467
Tonight, I promise,
there will be food in the house.

04:09.502 --> 04:10.534
And juice.

04:10.569 --> 04:11.734
Right.

04:11.769 --> 04:12.901
Those kids.

04:12.936 --> 04:15.834
I hate wasting food.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.666
Yes, my little baby.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.067
Have a nice day, honey.

04:30.968 --> 04:33.834
There better be juice
when I get home.

04:41.133 --> 04:44.167
I don't care what
your little ruler says.

04:44.202 --> 04:47.534
I've been a 7 since I graduated
from high school.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.133
Well, these are 7s.

04:50.168 --> 04:53.133
The box says 9
because, well, uh...

04:53.168 --> 04:55.300
Look, lady.
You're a 9.

04:56.501 --> 04:59.400
I can accept it.
Why can't you?

04:59.435 --> 05:01.167
You're very fresh!

05:01.202 --> 05:02.501
No, ma'am,
that's impossible,

05:02.536 --> 05:04.133
because
for the last hour,

05:04.168 --> 05:06.267
I've been trying to squeeze
your foot into a shoe,

05:06.302 --> 05:08.968
when I really should have
been easing them into the box.

05:09.003 --> 05:11.367
I'd say I'm anything
but fresh.

05:11.402 --> 05:13.868
By the way, you want
to tell John Henry there

05:13.903 --> 05:16.868
to give the $100
pumps a rest?

05:16.903 --> 05:20.234
Your ad says
"Courteous service."

05:20.269 --> 05:22.167
That's not my ad, ma'am.

05:22.202 --> 05:23.667
That's the former owner's.

05:23.702 --> 05:26.167
He was killed, tragically,
on this very spot

05:26.202 --> 05:29.667
when a size 9
exploded in his face.

05:29.702 --> 05:32.167
Come on, Arnold.
We're leaving.

05:32.202 --> 05:33.667
I want a balloon.

05:33.702 --> 05:35.033
You've already
got one.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.968
Hey, Al. You mind
if I go to lunch?

05:44.003 --> 05:45.968
You just came
from lunch.

05:46.003 --> 05:47.234
Yeah, technically.

05:47.269 --> 05:50.133
Biologically, I was
in bed with some broad.

05:50.168 --> 05:52.667
Luke, how can
you be happy

05:52.702 --> 05:55.167
sleeping with every
woman you meet?

05:55.202 --> 05:58.300
I don't know,
but I am.

05:58.335 --> 05:59.901
I'll tell you,
as your friend,

05:59.936 --> 06:01.801
I can't wait till you
get married.

06:01.836 --> 06:04.801
Yeah. A wife and kids
who adore you.

06:04.836 --> 06:05.968
A wife...

06:06.003 --> 06:07.133
Kids...

06:07.168 --> 06:08.634
The list goes on and on.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.868
It's just seeing their faces
light up in the morning

06:11.903 --> 06:13.234
when they see you.

06:13.269 --> 06:15.100
They can't do enough for you.

06:15.135 --> 06:16.300
It's heaven on earth.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.300
No, Al. That is.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.968
Luke Ventura,
at your feet.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.701
Do you work here,

06:27.736 --> 06:29.701
or are you
just loitering?

06:29.736 --> 06:31.200
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

06:31.235 --> 06:33.501
I'd like to see
some shoes, please.

06:35.534 --> 06:36.968
Uh, let me guess.

06:37.003 --> 06:39.501
Uh...size 7s.

06:39.536 --> 06:41.467
Yes. How did you know?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.234
All women are 7s.

06:46.634 --> 06:49.634
I know you've been
told this before,

06:49.669 --> 06:52.234
but you have the instep
of a movie star.

06:52.269 --> 06:54.300
Really?

06:54.335 --> 06:56.300
Hey, Al. Meet Tawny.

06:56.335 --> 06:57.634
Al's married.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.067
Listen, Al,
I forgot to tell you.

07:03.102 --> 07:05.167
I got an extra ticket to
the Bulls/Lakers game tonight.

07:05.202 --> 07:06.767
Court level.
Want to go?

07:06.802 --> 07:07.934
Hell, yeah!

07:07.969 --> 07:09.400
Sure your wife
will let you?

07:09.435 --> 07:10.667
Let me tell you something.

07:10.702 --> 07:12.868
No woman tells
Al Bundy what to do.

07:12.903 --> 07:15.467
Hey, you.
Get my shoes.

07:15.502 --> 07:16.501
Yes, ma'am.

07:19.334 --> 07:22.334
<i>We're here today
with our staff anthropologist,</i>

07:22.369 --> 07:26.834
<i>Dr. Jim, who discovered
a tribe of women in the Amazon</i>

07:26.869 --> 07:28.834
<i>who, like the praying mantis,</i>

07:28.869 --> 07:31.367
<i>devour their males
after mating season.</i>

07:31.402 --> 07:32.534
<i>Oh, my God.
Ladies?</i>

07:52.701 --> 07:54.167
Hi, honey.

07:54.202 --> 07:57.100
Hi. Working hard?

07:57.135 --> 07:58.334
Oh, yeah.

07:58.369 --> 08:01.834
You know I like
to keep the house clean.

08:01.869 --> 08:02.901
Whew! Hard day?

08:02.936 --> 08:04.234
Yeah. You?

08:04.269 --> 08:06.534
Oh, yeah.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.400
Yeah, it must have been.
Even the TV's sweating.

08:10.667 --> 08:13.167
Hey, get me
some juice, okay?

08:13.202 --> 08:16.167
Oh, that's what
I forgot to do.

08:16.202 --> 08:17.834
That's okay.
Juice isn't important.

08:17.869 --> 08:20.434
Listen, honey,
I know you've been busy

08:20.469 --> 08:22.100
around the house all day.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.367
so you don't have to bother
making me dinner tonight.

08:24.402 --> 08:26.400
I got a little
surprise for you.

08:26.435 --> 08:28.934
I'm going to the
ball game tonight.

08:28.969 --> 08:30.434
Al.
Hm?

08:30.469 --> 08:32.000
You're not going
to the game tonight.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.100
Sure, I am.

08:33.135 --> 08:34.534
See, let me explain
something to you.

08:34.568 --> 08:36.133
I work all day.

08:36.168 --> 08:39.366
And when somebody works all day,
they need to have fun at night.

08:39.402 --> 08:41.868
I don't actually expect
you to understand,

08:41.903 --> 08:45.033
but trust me. I'm your husband.
I know best.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.868
Isn't staying home
with me fun?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.934
Don't wait up.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.701
Al, you're not
going to the game tonight.

08:57.736 --> 08:59.000
I see you misunderstood me.

08:59.035 --> 09:00.367
You must have
thought I said,

09:00.402 --> 09:02.701
"Is it okay with you
if I go to the game?"

09:02.736 --> 09:04.701
You know,
like a question.

09:04.736 --> 09:06.434
There's no question
about this.

09:06.469 --> 09:07.934
No, there isn't.

09:07.969 --> 09:09.400
You cannot go
to the game tonight.

09:09.435 --> 09:10.567
Why not?

09:10.602 --> 09:11.801
Because I invited
company over.

09:11.836 --> 09:12.901
Company?!

09:12.936 --> 09:15.534
Who the hell would want
to come over here?

09:15.569 --> 09:17.334
You know that honeymoon couple
that moved next door?

09:17.369 --> 09:18.400
No.

09:18.435 --> 09:20.234
I invited them over.
I thought I told you.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.400
You didn't.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.801
Look, I worked hard
all day.

09:22.836 --> 09:24.300
The last thing
I want to do

09:24.335 --> 09:26.200
is spend the evening
with people I don't know.

09:26.235 --> 09:28.767
Now, look. They are new
in the neighborhood.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.200
They have lived here
for two months,

09:30.235 --> 09:31.601
and they have no friends.

09:31.636 --> 09:33.100
We have lived here
for 15 years,

09:33.135 --> 09:34.767
and we have no friends.

09:34.802 --> 09:37.834
Al, I want to have
some friends.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.200
Are you implying

09:39.235 --> 09:40.934
that it's my fault
you have no friends?

09:40.969 --> 09:44.801
Oh, no. It's me who sits in
front of the TV set burping,

09:44.836 --> 09:47.367
with my hand
thrust down my pants.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.133
You keep it cold
in this house, Peg.

09:52.168 --> 09:55.167
Al, every night
when the kids go out,

09:55.202 --> 09:57.167
it's just you and me.

09:57.202 --> 10:01.934
Can't you see how boring
that is for me, honey?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.534
Look, all I am asking

10:03.569 --> 10:05.934
is that we have
some people over for one night

10:05.969 --> 10:07.701
and for you
to be nice.

10:07.736 --> 10:09.200
Oh, I'm gonna be nice.

10:09.235 --> 10:11.434
How's this for nice?
I'm not even gonna be here.

10:11.469 --> 10:13.100
I'm going to the game.

10:13.135 --> 10:15.100
All right, Al. Fine.
But before you go,

10:15.135 --> 10:17.868
I would just like to say
three things.

10:17.903 --> 10:20.901
The bank book
is in both our names,

10:20.936 --> 10:23.901
the credit cards
are in both our names,

10:23.936 --> 10:26.267
and the stores
are still open.

10:37.501 --> 10:39.868
Why didn't you
get me juice?

10:52.234 --> 10:53.734
Kids gone?

10:53.769 --> 10:58.434
Yeah.
But they'll be back.

10:58.469 --> 11:01.934
I can't believe you invited
these people over tonight.

11:01.969 --> 11:03.334
I hate company.

11:03.369 --> 11:05.334
Would you for once
think about me?

11:05.369 --> 11:07.334
I am at home all day,
alone.

11:07.369 --> 11:09.834
You're out there around people
all the time.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.033
You know,
I need some fun too.

11:12.068 --> 11:14.067
Too? Oh, sure,
on the surface

11:14.102 --> 11:15.534
selling women's shoes
is fun.

11:15.569 --> 11:16.868
But once you cut through

11:16.903 --> 11:18.534
all the hype, the myths,
the glamour,

11:18.569 --> 11:23.100
it's really very much like any
minimum-wage-paying slow death.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.267
Hi, Mom.

11:28.302 --> 11:29.934
Dad, can I
have $5.00?

11:29.969 --> 11:32.400
When I was a kid,
I had to earn my money.

11:32.435 --> 11:35.501
Did you ever once think about
trying to earn your money?

11:35.536 --> 11:36.667
Okay, Dad.

11:36.702 --> 11:38.167
Do you want to know

11:38.202 --> 11:40.667
who Kelly was with
this afternoon?

11:40.702 --> 11:41.701
Who?

11:47.734 --> 11:50.234
You know the kid
they call Cobra,

11:50.269 --> 11:52.734
the kid with the sore
on his mouth?

11:52.769 --> 11:54.234
Good job, son.

11:54.269 --> 11:55.400
Thanks, Dad.

11:55.435 --> 11:56.601
Where are you going?

11:56.636 --> 11:58.067
Joey's dad's
waiting for me outside.

11:58.102 --> 12:00.067
We're going
to the basketball game tonight.

12:00.102 --> 12:01.767
Mom said it was okay.
Bye.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.601
The Lakers
are in town.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.334
He really wanted
to go.

12:06.467 --> 12:08.334
Hi, Mom.
Dad, can I have $10?

12:08.369 --> 12:10.267
Who were you
with today?

12:10.302 --> 12:11.334
Nobody.

12:11.369 --> 12:13.400
Does nobody
have a name?

12:13.435 --> 12:16.868
You know, Tom, Dick, Cobra
with a sore on his mouth?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.300
Oh, Dad. It's not
that kind of a sore.

12:19.335 --> 12:21.501
He just fell asleep
with a cigar in his mouth.

12:21.536 --> 12:22.868
What?

12:22.903 --> 12:25.868
You gave some to Bud,
you have to give to Kelly too.

12:25.903 --> 12:27.033
Remember, Al.
No favoritism.

12:27.068 --> 12:29.534
Peg, she's going out
with a guy

12:29.569 --> 12:30.634
named after a reptile.

12:30.669 --> 12:32.667
His real name
is Stanley.

12:32.702 --> 12:35.400
They only call him Cobra because
he has one painted on his van.

12:35.435 --> 12:36.868
And you find this
acceptable?

12:36.903 --> 12:39.801
I've met him,
and he's a very nice boy.

12:41.003 --> 12:43.667
* Dum de dum dum *

12:43.702 --> 12:46.000
That's his horn.
Isn't it great?

12:46.035 --> 12:48.300
I guess that's why
I fell in love with him.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.701
Bye, Mom.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.000
Bye, honey.

12:52.801 --> 12:55.801
You know, we must have
done something right.

12:55.836 --> 12:57.734
We raised
two great kids.

13:01.102 --> 13:04.067
I'm sorry, honey.
I didn't hear you.

13:04.102 --> 13:07.100
I was just thinking
of killing myself.

13:07.135 --> 13:08.601
Not tonight, honey.

13:08.636 --> 13:10.934
We have company
coming over.

13:10.969 --> 13:13.434
Look, it's time
for the pre-game show.

13:13.469 --> 13:15.834
Oh, no, you don't.
Every time we have company,

13:15.869 --> 13:17.200
you turn on this TV

13:17.235 --> 13:18.868
and immediately
separate yourself.

13:18.903 --> 13:21.634
Not tonight. You can always
watch a basketball game.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.534
Oh, but I couldn't always
meet our next-door neighbors.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.634
Now I see.

13:25.769 --> 13:27.534
That must be Steve and Marcie
from next door.

13:27.569 --> 13:29.601
Steve and Marcie?
I'm gonna miss a game

13:29.636 --> 13:31.467
for people named
Steve and Marcie?

13:31.502 --> 13:34.400
What's their
last name, Gorme?

13:34.435 --> 13:35.901
And that is another thing, Al.

13:35.936 --> 13:38.934
When they're in here, I do not
want you making snide comments.

13:38.969 --> 13:41.734
That is why we have
no friends.

13:41.769 --> 13:44.234
Excuse me, Peg.
I thought we had no friends

13:44.269 --> 13:46.100
because I put my hands
down my pants.

13:47.235 --> 13:48.567
Now, that's them.

13:48.602 --> 13:50.701
Another thing. Do not
eat or drink anything.

13:50.736 --> 13:53.701
One of them may have to use
the bathroom after you.

13:53.736 --> 13:55.734
I'm gonna hate
these people.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.701
You will not hate them
They are very nice.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.701
If they were nice, they'd
be dead and I'd be at the game.

14:00.736 --> 14:02.968
Get the door.
Get my juice.

14:04.734 --> 14:06.234
Hello.
I'm Marcie.

14:06.269 --> 14:07.400
I'm Steve.

14:07.435 --> 14:08.868
You have
a beautiful home.

14:08.903 --> 14:11.067
Yeah, so do you.
Come on in.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.767
Howdy, neighbor!

14:13.802 --> 14:16.100
Yeah, yeah.
I hate these people.

14:16.135 --> 14:17.601
Why don't
we sit down.

14:17.636 --> 14:19.634
Gee, you know,
I'm kind of embarrassed.

14:19.669 --> 14:22.467
I have nothing
to serve you.

14:22.502 --> 14:24.033
Listen,
if you're hungry,

14:24.068 --> 14:26.400
there's a store
a few blocks away.

14:26.435 --> 14:29.400
If you're going,
get me some juice, okay?

14:29.435 --> 14:30.801
Al's only kidding.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.200
He's just upset because

14:32.235 --> 14:33.901
I didn't have time
to do the shopping.

14:33.936 --> 14:35.901
You know,
Steve and I

14:35.936 --> 14:38.734
decided to share
the household chores.

14:38.769 --> 14:40.400
Gee, that's great.

14:40.435 --> 14:43.300
You see, Al.
Steve helps around the house.

14:43.335 --> 14:44.868
Way to go, Steve.

14:46.434 --> 14:48.334
Say, listen,
who do you like

14:48.369 --> 14:51.033
to win the NBA championship
this year?

14:51.068 --> 14:54.334
Well, Al...
to tell you the truth,

14:54.369 --> 14:56.701
since we got married,

14:56.736 --> 14:58.701
I don't watch
much sports.

14:58.736 --> 15:00.200
Marcie doesn't like it,

15:00.235 --> 15:03.400
and we decided we'll only
do things we both like.

15:04.901 --> 15:08.100
I feel that sports glorify
violence and competition,

15:08.135 --> 15:10.601
and I don't think it's
psychologically healthy.

15:10.636 --> 15:13.234
When we have a child,
we don't want it to grow up

15:13.269 --> 15:15.534
with that "winning
is the only thing" attitude.

15:15.569 --> 15:19.934
A child is better off
not being exposed to sports.

15:19.969 --> 15:21.634
You gonna neuter him too?

15:26.100 --> 15:27.601
Do you two have any kids?

15:27.636 --> 15:28.601
Two.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.901
Where are they?

15:29.936 --> 15:31.267
I don't know.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.667
So, Steve...

15:36.702 --> 15:40.100
looks like life is really
shaping up for you two.

15:40.135 --> 15:42.601
How long you two crazy kids
been married?

15:42.636 --> 15:44.067
Two months, Al.

15:44.102 --> 15:45.667
Well, Marcie,
looks like you got

15:45.702 --> 15:49.534
a heck of a piece of clay
to work with.

15:51.801 --> 15:54.133
We've been married
15 years.

15:54.168 --> 15:55.868
Well, what's
your secret?

15:55.903 --> 15:58.100
Oh, no secret, really.

15:58.135 --> 16:01.200
Just to be considerate, accept
each other for what you are,

16:01.235 --> 16:02.834
don't point out the fact

16:02.869 --> 16:04.701
that the hair
he's losing on his head

16:04.736 --> 16:06.267
is now growing
out of his nose.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.467
And his ears.

16:16.501 --> 16:19.000
And accepting the fact
that nowadays

16:19.035 --> 16:22.501
it's harder to figure out
where her chest ends

16:22.536 --> 16:23.868
and her stomach begins.

16:27.133 --> 16:29.234
I'll get us
some coffee, Marcie.

16:29.269 --> 16:30.367
I'll help.

16:30.402 --> 16:31.400
Me too.

16:31.435 --> 16:32.901
Hey. You know
another thing

16:32.936 --> 16:36.067
that makes women
such a blessing to us?

16:36.102 --> 16:38.567
It's like when you're
sitting somewhere,

16:38.602 --> 16:41.067
and they come over
and they say to you,

16:41.102 --> 16:43.100
"What are you
thinking?"

16:43.135 --> 16:44.601
And you
start thinking...

16:44.636 --> 16:47.100
"You know, if I wanted
you to know,

16:47.135 --> 16:48.467
I'd be talking."

16:53.934 --> 16:56.434
Isn't that
an awful lot of coffee

16:56.469 --> 16:57.934
you're putting in there?

16:57.969 --> 16:59.167
Yes.

16:59.202 --> 17:00.634
That's for them.

17:00.669 --> 17:02.133
Ours will be good.

17:02.168 --> 17:03.901
You see,
if they enjoy

17:03.936 --> 17:05.634
eating and drinking
at home too much,

17:05.669 --> 17:07.400
they never
take you anywhere.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.501
With men, if you ask them
for something,

17:11.536 --> 17:13.000
you are never
gonna get it.

17:13.035 --> 17:15.000
But if you
do some damage

17:15.035 --> 17:16.501
to their
internal organs,

17:16.536 --> 17:17.867
you got a shot.

17:19.634 --> 17:21.634
And if it
doesn't work...

17:21.669 --> 17:23.067
what have you lost?

17:23.102 --> 17:25.434
Could you fill this
with tap water, please.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.701
Well, I have
to be honest.

17:29.736 --> 17:32.968
So far, Steve has been
the ideal husband.

17:33.003 --> 17:34.167
Oh, really?

17:34.202 --> 17:36.400
I bet the first couple
of weeks you were married,

17:36.435 --> 17:38.968
you went to bed
at the same time.

17:39.003 --> 17:40.267
Oh, yes.

17:40.302 --> 17:42.934
Have you noticed how
in the last month or so,

17:42.969 --> 17:46.334
he seems to be going to bed
a little later and later?

17:46.369 --> 17:47.868
Why, yes.

17:49.734 --> 17:52.300
How did you know?

17:52.335 --> 17:54.934
You're letting him
slip away, Marcie.

17:54.969 --> 17:57.567
You've got
a good thing going.

17:57.602 --> 18:00.534
Don't start letting him
have a good time alone.

18:00.569 --> 18:03.033
But we still have
a good time together.

18:03.068 --> 18:05.434
Then why is he
staying up?

18:10.400 --> 18:12.901
I'm telling you,
your son is gonna be a sissy

18:12.936 --> 18:14.901
if you let that woman

18:14.936 --> 18:16.267
take away your sports.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.634
I used to love sports.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.067
Of course you did.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.567
You're a man.

18:25.602 --> 18:27.501
But, Steve...

18:27.536 --> 18:29.501
you can love it again.

18:29.536 --> 18:32.667
Start with me
right now, Steve.

18:34.167 --> 18:35.667
Turn on that TV.

18:35.702 --> 18:38.167
I can't do it
for you.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.901
Turn it on...

18:39.936 --> 18:41.300
Settle back...

18:41.335 --> 18:42.367
Relax...

18:42.402 --> 18:45.434
and watch sports.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.501
You know, lately...

19:02.536 --> 19:05.634
he's been getting up
earlier than me too.

19:05.669 --> 19:08.100
Mm-mm-mm.
That's not good.

19:08.135 --> 19:09.968
Do you have PMS?

19:10.003 --> 19:11.267
No.

19:11.302 --> 19:12.367
Get it.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.534
Steve!

19:19.569 --> 19:20.601
Shh!
Hey!

19:20.636 --> 19:22.934
I thought we agreed:

19:22.969 --> 19:24.267
No sports.

19:24.302 --> 19:25.634
Nice shot.

19:34.734 --> 19:37.567
I demand to know
what you do late at night

19:37.602 --> 19:39.400
after I've
gone to bed.

19:39.435 --> 19:41.167
Are you
having fun alone, Steve?

19:44.501 --> 19:48.067
No. I just like
to stay up and think.

19:48.102 --> 19:51.234
What are you thinking?

19:51.269 --> 19:54.701
Well, if I wanted you
to know, I'd...

20:02.567 --> 20:04.601
Oh, just about...

20:04.636 --> 20:06.601
how much I love you.

20:06.636 --> 20:10.100
I'm going to the game
next week with Al.

20:10.135 --> 20:13.734
My mother's coming over
next week.

20:13.769 --> 20:15.767
Oh, yeah? She gonna
teach you how to bury me

20:15.802 --> 20:18.167
like she buried
her three husbands?

20:21.868 --> 20:22.868
Steve!

20:24.634 --> 20:26.634
Are you implying
that their suicides

20:26.669 --> 20:29.067
had something
to do with Mother?

20:32.801 --> 20:34.234
Oh.

20:34.269 --> 20:36.234
Well, if that's
your attitude,

20:36.269 --> 20:39.400
then maybe I should just pack
my bags and move in with her.

20:39.435 --> 20:42.133
Great. Then I could
go to bed at a normal hour.

20:44.634 --> 20:47.200
All right, Steve Rhoades,
let's go.

20:47.235 --> 20:48.734
We're going home.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.734
It's time to redefine
our relationship.

20:51.769 --> 20:52.934
Okay.

20:52.969 --> 20:55.968
Al, I'll see you
next week at the game.

20:56.003 --> 20:58.934
Peggy, I think we'll be spending
a lot of time together.

20:58.969 --> 21:00.100
Come on, Steve.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.767
We've got to talk.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.734
Make it quick.
I'm gonna watch boxing.

21:03.769 --> 21:05.567
You'll watch
nothing!

21:14.634 --> 21:16.100
Yeah!

21:16.135 --> 21:19.000
It's gonna be
rough for them.

21:19.035 --> 21:22.801
Yeah. Well, it was rough
for us, and we made it.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.067
Hey, you know what?

21:26.102 --> 21:28.467
Bud got an A
in school today.

21:28.502 --> 21:30.267
No kidding?
Yeah.

21:35.567 --> 21:38.100
Hey, let's go out
Saturday night.

21:38.135 --> 21:40.667
You know, to eat.
Just me and you.

21:40.702 --> 21:42.200
Sure, if you want to.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.367
We haven't been

21:43.402 --> 21:45.067
to The Captain's
Table in a long time.

21:45.102 --> 21:47.067
We always
like it there.

21:47.102 --> 21:49.601
They have
such a nice menu.

21:49.636 --> 21:50.934
Yeah.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.100
You want to go

21:55.135 --> 21:58.267
I thought you wanted
to watch the game.

21:58.302 --> 21:59.501
Nah!

21:59.536 --> 22:00.801
Who cares?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.968
You know, I like
the coffee there too.
