00:07.900 --> 00:08.990
Hey, what are you doing?

00:09.084 --> 00:10.584
Phoebe agreed
to wear a wire for us.

00:10.736 --> 00:12.085
Someone must've found out.

00:12.238 --> 00:13.828
We got a good look
at the killer.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.180
-How's Padma?
-Depressed about AJ.

00:15.332 --> 00:16.831
What if I offer
to be the sperm donor?

00:16.851 --> 00:18.742
-You can't be serious.
-Why not?

00:18.761 --> 00:20.744
Because I couldn't handle that.

00:20.913 --> 00:21.928
Mom?

00:22.931 --> 00:26.416
If it's not too late, I would
like to be your sperm donor.

00:26.435 --> 00:28.527
Yes, yes, yes!

00:28.678 --> 00:31.346
But there is a condition.
So if we're going to do this,

00:31.440 --> 00:33.515
I don't want to just be a donor.

00:33.609 --> 00:36.618
I want to be a father.

No. She...

02:12.374 --> 02:15.192
When we buried my father here,

02:15.285 --> 02:18.044
three years ago,
my mother wanted

02:18.197 --> 02:21.289
to plant a tree
to mark his grave.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.533
She told me
that even after death,

she would always want
to be by his side.

Yeah, but it's not exactly

03:27.433 --> 03:29.875
What are you doing?
We have to get to work.

03:30.026 --> 03:32.044
Woke up in the middle of the
night wondering about my will.

03:32.195 --> 03:33.787
It was written
a very long time ago

03:33.939 --> 03:34.955
and needs to be updated.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.381
Funerals do have that effect.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.383
-I should probably update mine.
-Well, it turns out

03:38.535 --> 03:40.719
that if I drop dead tomorrow,
everything I own

03:40.870 --> 03:43.371
-goes to my ex-wife.
-Feel free to leave her
that boat.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.373
Lord knows
I'm not maintaining it.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.874
It's serious.

03:46.969 --> 03:48.727
You are not about
to drop dead, I promise.

03:48.878 --> 03:51.972
People younger than me die
on the treadmill every day.

03:52.048 --> 03:53.306
I just need a trust

03:53.400 --> 03:55.216
that benefits
you and Jake and Sammie.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.385
And because Georgia doesn't
recognize common-law marriage,

03:57.479 --> 04:01.131
your part in this could be,
you know, pretty complicated.

04:01.149 --> 04:02.741
I have everything I want.

04:02.968 --> 04:04.301
Leave it all to them.

04:04.319 --> 04:06.411
Well, I don't want to do that.

04:06.563 --> 04:09.539
Okay, let's get married then.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.834
So, this is the way

04:20.928 --> 04:22.652
you ask me?

04:22.671 --> 04:24.488
No... no fancy dinner?

04:24.656 --> 04:25.672
No big ring?

04:25.766 --> 04:29.009
Just... didn't even
get down on one knee.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.845
I love you to the moon and back.

04:31.997 --> 04:34.088
But I kneel for no man.

04:34.108 --> 04:37.025
Okay, okay.

04:41.006 --> 04:42.355
I've heard your proposal.
I would like, uh,

04:42.508 --> 04:44.190
maybe a week to think about it.

04:44.343 --> 04:46.660
-Oh, stop it.
-It's a big decision.

04:50.607 --> 04:53.292
So, are we talking, like,
big destination wedding

04:53.443 --> 04:55.794
on Lake Como? 'Cause I could,
I could get behind that.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.189
I'm thinking a ceremony
in the backyard.

04:59.282 --> 05:00.948
We've both been married twice.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.011
-What about my bridesmaids?
-(both laugh)

05:06.956 --> 05:08.640
I want it to be special.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.642
It will be.

05:13.129 --> 05:14.220
(chuckles)

05:14.315 --> 05:16.039
<i> PATIENT:</i>
<i> And it's that easy?</i>

05:16.132 --> 05:19.559
Medicare will pay for anything
if you got the right story.

05:19.636 --> 05:22.821
Just last week, I told 'em
my cane wasn't cutting it.

05:22.972 --> 05:24.064
I don't even have a cane.

05:24.216 --> 05:25.382
And just like that,

05:25.475 --> 05:28.735
they handed me
a shiny new motorized scooter.

05:28.829 --> 05:33.147
Paid for 100%
by the taxpayers of America.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.240
Remind me to count
the wheelchairs.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.743
-Yeah.
-Hey, I'm no thief.

05:36.912 --> 05:38.078
But I am an opportunist.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.412
If I had a house,

05:39.565 --> 05:41.989
I'd have one
of them poofy chairs that tilt

05:42.084 --> 05:43.008
to help you stand up

05:43.159 --> 05:44.918
and an automated bed, too.

05:45.070 --> 05:48.513
All I need is a prescription
from a willing doc, cutie.

05:48.665 --> 05:50.073
And I know where to find 'em.
(chuckles)

05:50.166 --> 05:53.243
Yeah, but you don't want
that kind of doc

05:53.261 --> 05:54.186
-to actually treat you.
-(grumbles)

05:54.413 --> 05:56.170
So, what brought you in today?

05:56.339 --> 05:59.875
Uh, had a bit of a rumble
a while back with this...

05:59.877 --> 06:02.419
numbnut moving in on my block.

06:02.512 --> 06:04.938
We got into it over
a hot chicken sandwich some...

06:05.090 --> 06:06.698
-do-gooder brought me. (groans)
-(hisses)

06:06.867 --> 06:10.093
I've been trying to treat it
on my own, but... (smacks lips)

06:10.112 --> 06:12.353
That ulcer looks
severely infected.

06:12.431 --> 06:14.206
Well, if you want
to keep that arm,

06:14.357 --> 06:15.665
we need to clear the infection.

06:17.119 --> 06:19.119
DEVON:
Hey. Thought you could use
a pick-me-up.

06:19.271 --> 06:23.215
Triple espresso with an absurd
amount of hazelnut creamer.

06:23.366 --> 06:24.791
Thanks.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.109
So, Cade showed up,

06:26.128 --> 06:27.611
so I'm off this afternoon.

06:27.629 --> 06:29.888
And your shift is over.
You want to grab lunch?

06:30.039 --> 06:31.205
Uh, I can't.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.040
I have another surgery.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.709
You're starting another shift?

06:34.728 --> 06:37.137
You sure that's a good idea?
You've been here all night.

06:37.289 --> 06:39.380
It's an interesting case.

06:39.549 --> 06:41.307
I'll manage.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.734
Leela.

06:43.795 --> 06:45.645
Um...

06:45.722 --> 06:47.130
we need to talk.

06:47.149 --> 06:48.298
What's there to talk about?

06:48.391 --> 06:50.391
-We're fine.
-I thought so, too.

06:50.485 --> 06:51.651
But you haven't been home
all week,

06:51.745 --> 06:54.228
and we've barely spoken
since I floated the idea

06:54.322 --> 06:56.139
of being Padma's sperm donor.

06:56.158 --> 06:58.475
(exhales)
Okay.

06:58.477 --> 07:00.143
Truth bomb--

07:00.162 --> 07:02.337
I'm still trying
to process that.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.256
Okay.

07:04.407 --> 07:05.424
So it...

07:05.575 --> 07:07.241
it is still an issue.

07:07.335 --> 07:08.718
Leela.

07:09.504 --> 07:10.503
Pre-op. Let's go.

07:10.656 --> 07:11.913
Right behind you.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.265
We'll talk tonight.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.684
I think we better.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.829
(sighs softly)

07:19.848 --> 07:21.314
(elevator dings)

07:24.761 --> 07:26.019
(loud thud)

07:26.113 --> 07:27.854
This is your second shift,
right?

07:28.006 --> 07:29.281
Sure you don't need that coffee?

07:29.432 --> 07:32.192
Positive. The adrenaline alone
is enough to keep me up.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.618
Especially for a case like this.

07:33.845 --> 07:36.846
Well, a full spinal
reconstruction is a great case.

07:37.015 --> 07:38.031
But it's a marathon,

07:38.183 --> 07:39.699
not a sprint.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.108
Eight to ten hours.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.186
A challenge of sheer endurance.

07:43.205 --> 07:44.278
I can find someone else

07:44.298 --> 07:45.947
-if you're tapped out.
-No.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.948
I'm good.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.875
I got this.

07:49.027 --> 07:49.876
Is that our patient?

07:50.028 --> 07:51.695
Yes. Ashley.

07:51.713 --> 07:54.639
24-year-old female
with congenital dextroscoliosis

07:54.866 --> 07:56.533
of the thoracic
and lumbar spine.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.885
The pain has started limiting
her activity level, and...

07:58.979 --> 08:00.553
she's not the type of person
to be limited.

08:00.706 --> 08:02.481
ASHLEY:
Can one of you tell
my bossy wife

08:02.632 --> 08:05.650
that stumbling around
like a troll to get my steps in

08:05.727 --> 08:07.060
is irrelevant at this point?

08:07.212 --> 08:08.469
Movement is medicine.

08:08.563 --> 08:11.156
-BILLIE: Music to my ears.
-(chuckling)

08:11.307 --> 08:14.809
Naomi is also
Ashley's physical therapist.

08:14.978 --> 08:16.386
I have to input some notes.

08:16.404 --> 08:20.957
But Dr. Devi here
will talk you through pre-op.

08:22.227 --> 08:23.502
Is that how you two met?

08:23.653 --> 08:26.320
I thought I was getting
a lifetime of free massages.

08:26.414 --> 08:27.989
But, instead, I get a lecture

08:28.008 --> 08:29.916
every time
my butt touches a chair.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.325
She is a couch potato.

08:31.419 --> 08:33.178
It's because I can
barely get up off the couch.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.904
-That's true.
-(chuckling)

08:34.998 --> 08:38.408
Well, we need a few more hours
to run all your pre-op tests.

08:38.426 --> 08:40.685
The surgery will be
in the early afternoon.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.839
Look at me, Dr. Sutton.
Don't I seem rarin' to go?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.173
You're very brave.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.192
I know this is scary.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.419
-She's terrified.
-Well,

08:49.512 --> 08:52.531
let me give you some hope
to hold on to.

08:53.592 --> 08:54.533
It's just a mock-up,

08:54.701 --> 08:56.776
but we should be able
to get pretty close.

08:57.763 --> 09:00.187
As long as you make me taller
than Naomi,

09:00.282 --> 09:02.374
-I'm good.
-(chuckles softly)

09:03.192 --> 09:04.042
Now get some rest.

09:04.193 --> 09:05.210
You earned it.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.864
Her type and screen
will be back in an hour, and...

09:09.958 --> 09:12.609
it'll be another hour
until our OR is clean.

09:12.627 --> 09:15.962
Find an empty bed
and get some rest until then.

09:16.114 --> 09:17.088
I'll call you when we're ready.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.282
That's an order.

09:19.301 --> 09:20.725
(sighs)

09:24.064 --> 09:26.481
(indistinct chatter)

09:30.737 --> 09:32.529
(exhales)

09:42.065 --> 09:43.898
(moans softly)

09:43.917 --> 09:46.251
(inhales deeply, exhales)

09:46.920 --> 09:48.402
(giggling)

09:48.496 --> 09:49.921
MAN:
I've seen a lot of gross stuff,

09:50.073 --> 09:51.648
-but that has to take the cake.
-Seriously.

09:51.741 --> 09:54.984
How do you get a fish hook
that size stuck in your cheek?

09:55.078 --> 09:56.094
Really bad casting.

09:56.245 --> 09:57.503
-(chuckles)
-Hey, did I show you

09:57.598 --> 09:59.639
-this new game
I got on my phone?
-(sighs)

10:00.992 --> 10:03.310
(video game sound effects)

10:05.439 --> 10:07.355
(woman laughs)

10:12.170 --> 10:14.112
We need some help over here!
Please! Anybody!

10:14.263 --> 10:15.596
-What's your name, hon?
-Scott.

10:15.765 --> 10:17.282
-But it's not me.
It's my coworker.
-What happened?

10:17.433 --> 10:18.766
We were working
on some power lines nearby.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.694
Uh, the plate wasn't secure.
It fell on top of him.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.346
Looks like a blunt chest wall
injury on his left side.

10:23.365 --> 10:24.681
DEVON:
The plate must have crushed

10:24.699 --> 10:26.516
his chest.
Obvious chest wall deformity.

10:26.609 --> 10:29.276
He may have broken every rib
on that side.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.462
And whatever's left of the lung

10:30.689 --> 10:32.522
underneath clearly isn't doing
too well.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.357
You got to help him.
He's a good guy.

10:34.450 --> 10:35.541
He taught me everything I know.

10:35.694 --> 10:37.877
Sir, can you please back up,
please?

10:38.029 --> 10:39.045
Thank you.

10:39.197 --> 10:40.546
-IV is in.
-(monitors beeping)

10:40.623 --> 10:43.141
Uh, let's give the doctors
some space.

10:43.292 --> 10:44.384
-Thank you so much.
-He's not gonna make it

10:44.536 --> 10:46.478
to the OR like this.
Let's intubate.

10:46.705 --> 10:47.871
Left lung is no<i> bueno.</i>

10:47.964 --> 10:49.481
We need to do
a single lung ventilation.

10:49.632 --> 10:51.298
You intubate, I'll position it
with the bronchoscope.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.984
We got one good shot at this.

10:53.136 --> 10:54.527
Pushing meds now.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.897
IRVING:
Great view of the cords.

10:58.049 --> 11:00.659
Inserting tube now.

11:02.812 --> 11:03.995
Scope going in.

11:07.909 --> 11:09.726
All right.

11:09.744 --> 11:10.985
Advance.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.629
Inflate the cuff.

11:18.828 --> 11:19.919
(beeping)

11:20.013 --> 11:21.346
He's stable.

11:21.497 --> 11:23.573
But it won't matter
if we don't get him to an OR.

11:23.591 --> 11:24.757
Okay, let's get transpo!

11:24.851 --> 11:27.035
Hundley, let's call
for a portable chest X-ray

11:27.170 --> 11:28.094
and page Austin.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.245
Tell him
that I think our patient

11:29.264 --> 11:30.263
needs to have his lung removed

11:30.415 --> 11:32.248
using an emergent pneumonectomy.

11:32.267 --> 11:33.483
Got it.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.436
All right. Here you go.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.756
-All right.
-Okay, hold on. This is a lot.

11:39.774 --> 11:42.033
Yeah, but don't worry about it.
I will handle it all.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.610
So far,
planning for our future child

11:44.763 --> 11:46.520
has been a great distraction.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.114
"Our" future child?

11:48.266 --> 11:50.767
AJ, I need a sperm donor, okay?

11:50.860 --> 11:52.127
Not-not all this.

11:52.954 --> 11:53.953
Look, Padma,

11:54.105 --> 11:55.288
I understand it's a lot.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.290
But bear with me. All right?

11:57.442 --> 12:00.885
I assure you, it will be worth
my top-shelf DNA.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.387
Arrogant.

12:02.614 --> 12:03.613
But accurate.

12:03.706 --> 12:04.872
All right, let's hear it.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.391
So, I took the liberty
of opening up

12:06.468 --> 12:08.952
a 529 savings account
for the baby.

12:09.045 --> 12:10.377
I will fund it annually

12:10.397 --> 12:13.214
to make sure our child's
college tuition is paid in full.

12:13.308 --> 12:14.899
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:15.126 --> 12:16.292
I don't want your money.

12:16.311 --> 12:17.794
You're turning down
a college fund?

12:17.812 --> 12:20.313
Ivy League schools
are expensive.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.722
Okay, well,

12:21.742 --> 12:23.149
what if they don't want to go
to an Ivy League?

12:23.301 --> 12:25.134
Or college at all?

12:25.136 --> 12:27.061
(chuckling)
Good one.

12:27.155 --> 12:29.806
All right,
moving on to my main point.

12:29.808 --> 12:33.643
Now, I have bio siblings
and parents who I barely know.

12:33.736 --> 12:36.996
We're not in touch and
I can't consider them family.

12:37.148 --> 12:38.072
And I want a family.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.983
Okay, see? This is...

12:40.001 --> 12:41.167
this is what I was afraid of.

12:41.319 --> 12:42.910
We're not creating a family.

12:43.004 --> 12:45.930
I know. But we agreed
that I would be involved

12:46.082 --> 12:47.915
-in the child's life.
-Yes.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.842
Involved means visitations,

12:49.995 --> 12:51.661
occasionally, on my schedule.

12:51.754 --> 12:55.607
No. No, the child needs to know
that I am their father.

12:55.834 --> 13:00.019
Okay, look, you can be there
on birthdays and holidays

13:00.171 --> 13:02.171
and, look, some weekends, too.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.616
What are you doing?
We-We're not done here.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.344
Padma, I get
that you are a free spirit.

13:08.363 --> 13:11.347
But a child has to have a roof
over their head,

13:11.516 --> 13:13.366
-financial security.
-Okay, I have a roof.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.960
You are not raising our child
in a van.

13:16.112 --> 13:17.778
That's a deal-breaker.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.446
-You hear me?
-(pager beeping)

13:19.466 --> 13:21.115
Look, I'm needed in the OR.
I'll be back.

13:21.209 --> 13:23.284
Okay, but we haven't
settled anything,

13:23.303 --> 13:24.969
except for the fact
that you're gonna be controlling

13:25.196 --> 13:25.970
and I won't be controlled.

13:26.197 --> 13:27.288
I hear you.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.289
We're gonna work it out,
all right?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.307
Just look over the papers.

13:29.458 --> 13:30.624
I'll be back in a couple hours.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.560
Mm.

13:36.465 --> 13:38.525
(loud snoring)

13:42.397 --> 13:44.531
(sighs)

13:46.067 --> 13:48.142
(moans softly)

13:48.161 --> 13:49.828
(indistinct chatter)

13:49.979 --> 13:51.237
Seriously?

13:51.389 --> 13:52.997
Sorry to interrupt
your beauty rest, Devi,

13:53.149 --> 13:54.240
but I'm on deck,

13:54.334 --> 13:55.649
which of course means
you are, too.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.077
No. I'm supposed to be
with Dr. Sutton today.

13:58.229 --> 13:59.896
Yeah? Well,
you look pretty busy.

13:59.914 --> 14:03.900
Now, if you'd like to opt out
of an emergent pneumonectomy,

14:03.918 --> 14:05.401
then be my guest.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.594
Pneumonectomy?

14:07.330 --> 14:08.404
You're joking, right?

14:08.423 --> 14:09.755
By now, you know me well enough

14:09.850 --> 14:11.757
to know the things
I do not joke about.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.500
But if you have better things
to do...

14:13.595 --> 14:15.186
No.

14:15.338 --> 14:17.080
(chuckles softly)
Who needs sleep anyway?

14:17.098 --> 14:19.399
My thoughts exactly.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.776
Eh, free food and
a warm blanket, I'm all good.

14:30.929 --> 14:33.854
-Not all good.
-(coughs) What?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.264
CONRAD:
You still have a fever, and we

14:35.399 --> 14:36.708
flooded you with antibiotics.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.935
So, if this combination
doesn't work, we need a plan B.

14:38.953 --> 14:40.694
I-I didn't know
there was antibiotics.

14:40.772 --> 14:43.364
If antibiotics was gonna work,
I wouldn't be here.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.216
Why is that?

14:45.368 --> 14:47.293
I'm already on one.
I've been on one for weeks.

14:47.445 --> 14:50.446
I had a bout of walking
pneumonia last month,

14:50.465 --> 14:53.449
and I went to Atlanta General ER

14:53.468 --> 14:54.409
that time.

14:54.411 --> 14:57.211
I'm an equal opportunity
ER surfer.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.398
-They gave me, um, these.
-(pills rattling)

15:05.739 --> 15:07.071
You didn't mention these meds.

15:07.223 --> 15:09.148
I need to know everything
you're taking.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.242
That's the only one.

15:11.469 --> 15:13.394
I owe my life
to fish oil and whiskey.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.321
And lenvatinib.

15:15.473 --> 15:17.582
-This one's for cancer.
-Seriously? Huh.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.751
Well, they must have given me
the wrong bottle.

15:19.978 --> 15:21.568
This drug costs, like,
$10,000 a month.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.421
Huh, and it was prescribed

15:23.572 --> 15:25.164
by a Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.166
Funny, think I'd remember that.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.819
You know,
if I wanted a pat-down,

15:29.912 --> 15:32.096
I would've gone through TSA.
I got to get out of here.

15:32.248 --> 15:35.675
Relax. Just take a second.

15:35.827 --> 15:37.343
(sighs)

15:37.495 --> 15:39.771
Look...

15:39.922 --> 15:41.514
I don't know anything.

15:41.666 --> 15:44.834
I'm a nobody. I'm a little cog

15:44.852 --> 15:46.653
in a very big machine.

15:47.689 --> 15:49.021
I could end up at the bottom

15:49.115 --> 15:52.358
of a lake
with my feet in concrete.

15:52.510 --> 15:54.494
I hear you.

15:57.773 --> 16:01.376
So, let's focus first
on how to treat you, okay?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.253
I'll be right back.

16:05.415 --> 16:07.382
(sighs)

16:08.969 --> 16:10.860
CADE:
Cancer drugs.

16:10.953 --> 16:12.878
Parkinson's meds.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.530
Viagra?

16:14.532 --> 16:18.034
The prescribing doctors
are all from Chastain.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.368
Dr. Bell, Dr. Pravesh...

16:19.462 --> 16:22.463
And there's a lot more
where that came from.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.797
Well, we have to call the FBI.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.374
Let Agent Barker know
about this.

16:25.393 --> 16:27.652
I know, and we will,
but Teri needs medical attention

16:27.879 --> 16:29.636
immediately,
or she'll lose her arm.

16:29.731 --> 16:31.823
I don't love the idea
of waiting to make that call.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.232
(sighs)

16:33.326 --> 16:34.993
I get the feeling
that she'd rather go to jail

16:35.220 --> 16:36.477
than talk to the FBI anyway.

16:36.571 --> 16:38.721
-So, what do you want to do?
-CONRAD: Treat her,

16:38.723 --> 16:40.481
earn her trust,
and then find some way

16:40.575 --> 16:42.908
to get her to open up
about the scam.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.486
Okay. Let's work together.

16:45.580 --> 16:46.912
How do we save her arm?

16:47.007 --> 16:51.092
Well, I have a possible
solution, but it's unorthodox.

16:52.420 --> 16:55.254
Padma has seemed to
have forgotten the condition

16:55.406 --> 16:57.348
upon which I agreed to do this.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.092
She wants my sperm,
but not my involvement.

17:00.245 --> 17:01.594
And when you do have an opinion

17:01.688 --> 17:03.929
and draw a clear boundary,
it's still not enough.

17:04.082 --> 17:06.249
I should not have to explain why
I feel a certain type of way.

17:06.342 --> 17:08.175
You are absolutely right.

17:08.269 --> 17:09.769
Just like I shouldn't
have to explain

17:09.921 --> 17:11.863
why I want a roof
over my child's head

17:11.939 --> 17:13.865
that's not made of vinyl.

17:14.016 --> 17:15.258
You're right.

17:15.276 --> 17:16.701
See?

17:16.852 --> 17:19.095
At least the two of us have
our heads screwed on straight.

17:19.155 --> 17:21.497
(monitor beeping rapidly)

17:22.433 --> 17:24.600
It's his pulmonary artery.

17:24.693 --> 17:27.119
Inflammatory mediators
are causing vasoconstriction.

17:27.272 --> 17:29.047
He's going into acute heart
failure. Let's hang two liters

17:29.274 --> 17:30.531
of saline and nitroglycerin.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.292
Are my ears bleeding,
or did you just order fluid

17:33.369 --> 17:35.111
and nitroglycerin
to save his heart?

17:35.204 --> 17:36.721
(stammers) My-my mistake.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.114
I meant nitric oxide,

17:38.207 --> 17:39.615
and hold on the bolus.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.208
Well, maybe your head
isn't screwed on

17:41.227 --> 17:42.393
so straight after all, Devi.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.546
I'm sorry.
My brain's a little fogged.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.290
Well, un-fog it, Devi.

17:47.308 --> 17:50.359
There's no room for error here,
you hear me?

17:59.487 --> 18:01.637
(sighs) You are not putting
maggots on me.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.063
I know it sounds medieval,

18:03.083 --> 18:04.473
but these are
pharmaceutical-grade larva.

18:04.492 --> 18:06.142
-They're grown in a lab.
-The maggots

18:06.235 --> 18:08.477
will eat away
at the necrotic tissue.

18:08.571 --> 18:10.237
It's your best chance
to avoid amputation.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.590
You can close your eyes
if that makes it easier.

18:12.741 --> 18:15.742
It won't stop me from feeling
like a decomposing corpse.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.153
Hey, you seem tough.

18:17.246 --> 18:19.746
You can handle a few bugs.

18:19.841 --> 18:21.006
All right.

18:21.159 --> 18:22.558
Get on with it.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.683
I love bugs.

18:30.835 --> 18:34.019
I haven't used sterile maggots
since I was in Afghanistan.

18:34.172 --> 18:36.096
Field medicine at its finest.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.931
I had some experience
with them in Haiti.

18:38.025 --> 18:39.358
Works like a drug, but without

18:39.510 --> 18:40.693
all the undesirable
side effects.

18:40.845 --> 18:43.937
Well, why do I feel sicker
than when I walked in?

18:43.957 --> 18:46.207
(gagging)

18:47.127 --> 18:48.275
-(elevator dings)
-All right,

18:48.294 --> 18:49.869
so, by the way,
I think I've found

18:50.021 --> 18:52.855
the perfect solution
for our housing hiccup.

18:52.874 --> 18:56.208
You're gonna love it because it
keeps you totally independent.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.118
I don't remember asking
for your help.

18:58.212 --> 18:59.637
Well, you didn't have to,
but I am prepared

18:59.806 --> 19:01.305
to offer you my mother's house,

19:01.532 --> 19:03.366
no strings attached, not one.

19:03.459 --> 19:06.051
-You can't be serious.
-I know it's a generous offer,

19:06.204 --> 19:08.704
but nothing's too good
for family.

19:08.723 --> 19:10.797
It's a great neighborhood,
top-notch school district,

19:10.817 --> 19:13.800
and, of course, I will pay
all the taxes and upkeep.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.378
Just to clarify,
you want me to move into

19:15.471 --> 19:17.137
your recently deceased
mother's old house?

19:17.231 --> 19:19.473
Well, I can't imagine a better
place for our child to grow up

19:19.567 --> 19:22.218
-than the house I was raised in.
-You are insane.

19:22.236 --> 19:23.719
You didn't hear
a word I said earlier.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.070
I just offered you a free house.

19:25.223 --> 19:26.313
This is not the reaction
I was expecting.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.573
Look, I understand
you're grieving,

19:27.725 --> 19:29.074
so I'm gonna say this
as nicely as I can,

19:29.169 --> 19:30.334
you have crossed a line.

19:30.486 --> 19:32.336
-What're you talking about?
-We clearly have

19:32.371 --> 19:34.321
very different ideas of what
parenthood looks like.

19:34.415 --> 19:36.081
I'm not here to create
your Mini-Me.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.401
I want my own baby.

19:38.494 --> 19:40.011
This was a huge mistake.
I'm sorry.

19:40.238 --> 19:41.679
I don't think
this is gonna work out.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.832
Yeah, private ceremony,
you, me, and a judge.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.334
That could be
just as meaningful.

19:47.503 --> 19:49.670
On the other hand,
the world is so dark and dreary

19:49.689 --> 19:52.264
right now, why would we miss
an opportunity to celebrate?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.007
-Okay, now you're flip-flopping.
-No,

19:54.101 --> 19:57.010
I'm not. I'm weighing all
options, looking at both sides.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.939
Okay, here's what I have to say,
whatever you want,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.590
my answer is, "Yes, dear."

20:01.609 --> 20:04.702
That works both ways.
It can't just be what I want,

20:04.929 --> 20:06.019
or what you want.

20:06.113 --> 20:08.597
We have to find a middle ground,

20:08.616 --> 20:10.625
-together.
-Yes, dear.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.127
Hey.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.055
I need to talk to someone,

20:24.206 --> 20:26.298
and Leela's so busy.

20:26.451 --> 20:27.892
DEVON:
Is everything okay?

20:28.043 --> 20:30.353
No. Everything is terrible.

20:36.644 --> 20:38.569
You're not having regrets

20:38.721 --> 20:41.072
about the embryo implantation,
are you?

20:41.299 --> 20:42.556
PADMA:
I am.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.369
It seems I have chosen
the wrong father.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.992
Okay. What do you mean?

20:53.144 --> 20:56.145
AJ will make
a great dad one day,

20:56.163 --> 20:59.164
just... not to my child.

20:59.317 --> 21:01.166
I shouldn't have
rushed into this.

21:01.319 --> 21:04.262
I should've weighed
all my options.

21:06.157 --> 21:07.823
So Leela told you
about my offer?

21:07.842 --> 21:09.992
Your offer?

21:10.011 --> 21:11.994
I'm still happy to help.

21:11.996 --> 21:14.272
But, look, between you and me,

21:14.440 --> 21:15.773
Leela was not thrilled

21:15.924 --> 21:17.775
when I threw out the idea
of being the sperm donor.

21:17.852 --> 21:20.278
You did what now?

21:20.429 --> 21:22.971
Wait... she didn't tell you?

21:23.098 --> 21:25.841
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't have said anything.

21:25.934 --> 21:28.694
Because this would
solve everything.

21:28.846 --> 21:31.155
No. No, it wouldn't.

21:32.441 --> 21:35.459
I promise you, this would
make things much worse,

21:35.686 --> 21:38.037
-for the both of us.
-I mean, I get it's a little...

21:38.189 --> 21:40.523
it's a little crazy, but...

21:40.691 --> 21:42.949
you wouldn't be making
these demands AJ's making.

21:43.044 --> 21:44.043
Padma, listen to me.

21:44.195 --> 21:45.452
I love Leela,

21:45.546 --> 21:48.955
and I don't want to do
anything to hurt her, so...

21:48.975 --> 21:50.032
Please,

21:50.051 --> 21:52.643
just forget that
I said anything.

22:02.897 --> 22:04.046
(door closes)

22:04.065 --> 22:05.323
(sighs)

22:05.550 --> 22:08.551
<i> BILLIE:</i>
<i> This is what we live for.</i>

22:08.569 --> 22:10.161
We have to execute flawlessly.

22:10.388 --> 22:13.238
If we do, our patient's life
will be changed

22:13.391 --> 22:14.999
dramatically for the better.

22:15.150 --> 22:16.909
Let's cross our T's
and dot our i's.

22:17.061 --> 22:18.077
This is gonna take a while.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.896
One slip,
and we can do great harm,

22:20.989 --> 22:22.423
so let's focus.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.659
You good?

22:25.828 --> 22:27.086
Fresh as a daisy.

22:27.238 --> 22:29.162
Well, if everyone's bladders
are empty,

22:29.182 --> 22:31.307
let's get a move on.

22:44.939 --> 22:47.031
CADE: Maggots are making
some real progress.

22:47.182 --> 22:48.440
Never thought I'd say this,

22:48.534 --> 22:51.202
but I'm glad bugs
are eating my flesh.

22:51.353 --> 22:52.036
(laughs)

22:52.263 --> 22:55.331
And I'm grateful to y'all.

22:57.952 --> 22:59.210
Teri, will you tell us
what you know

22:59.361 --> 23:00.861
about those prescription pills?

23:00.955 --> 23:03.606
Now, see, you had to go
and ruin the moment.

23:03.624 --> 23:07.033
Help us out, and we'll help
keep you safe.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.128
What do you mean safe?

23:09.280 --> 23:10.462
-Did you call the Feds?
-CADE: No,

23:10.615 --> 23:12.205
because we understand
why you're afraid.

23:12.299 --> 23:14.374
We know the men
behind this are dangerous.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.643
(sighs)

23:19.140 --> 23:21.381
A pharmacist,

23:21.475 --> 23:24.217
the same one who filled
some of your prescriptions,

23:24.311 --> 23:27.738
was murdered right here
in this hospital.

23:27.890 --> 23:29.890
Her name was Phoebe Moffit.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.559
No, Phoebe?

23:32.637 --> 23:34.578
They killed Phoebe?

23:34.730 --> 23:36.138
You knew her?

23:36.157 --> 23:39.083
She wasn't like them.

23:39.234 --> 23:41.067
She was no different than me.

23:41.162 --> 23:42.978
She was just a good egg

23:42.997 --> 23:44.422
who fell on hard times

23:44.590 --> 23:46.498
and did whatever
she could to survive.

23:46.667 --> 23:49.075
They took advantage of that.

23:49.170 --> 23:50.669
And they're taking
advantage of you, too.

23:50.821 --> 23:53.505
-Aren't they?
-CADE: We share a common enemy.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.874
We will protect you.

23:56.026 --> 23:57.176
You can help us
put an end to this,

23:57.344 --> 24:00.062
so no one else has to die,
like Phoebe.

24:01.849 --> 24:05.017
Here's the deal.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.760
I'll tell you what I know,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.446
for Phoebe,

24:08.597 --> 24:11.356
but you got to swear
to keep my name out of it.

24:11.509 --> 24:12.950
CADE:
It'll be anonymous.

24:13.101 --> 24:15.619
We swear.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.776
Why don't we find somewhere

24:22.795 --> 24:25.087
more private to talk.

24:26.023 --> 24:27.798
Just start from the beginning.

24:28.025 --> 24:30.259
How did the mob find you?

24:31.119 --> 24:33.119
I had some hard times,

24:33.139 --> 24:34.697
made some bad choices.

24:34.715 --> 24:35.881
I got evicted from my home.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.868
I was looking for a place
I could lay my head.

24:39.962 --> 24:43.872
<i>It was supposed to be temporary,</i>
<i> until I got back on my feet,</i>

24:43.966 --> 24:45.465
<i>but it never works out that way,</i>

24:45.559 --> 24:49.094
<i> so I had to figure out</i>
<i> how to make do.</i>

24:49.155 --> 24:51.638
<i>That was when I first saw them.</i>

24:51.732 --> 24:54.049
<i> This sketchy bus showed up.</i>

24:54.068 --> 24:56.068
All right. Y'all know the drill.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.386
Let's see those
red, white, and blues.

24:57.479 --> 24:58.645
<i> TERI:</i>
<i>I thought they were passing out</i>

24:58.739 --> 25:00.647
<i> free meals or something,</i>
<i> the way everyone</i>

25:00.741 --> 25:03.575
<i> -was carrying on.</i>
-DRIVER: Hey, lady, you got

25:03.728 --> 25:05.077
Medicare?

25:05.153 --> 25:06.653
Maybe. What's it to you?

25:06.672 --> 25:09.381
If you want to make some money,
let's see your card.

25:11.159 --> 25:12.510
Hop on board.

25:12.661 --> 25:15.904
<i> TERI: It turns out</i>
<i> "red, white, and blue" is code</i>

25:15.923 --> 25:18.182
<i> for Medicare ID cards</i>

25:18.333 --> 25:20.409
<i> because of their</i>
<i> patriotic coloring.</i>

25:20.502 --> 25:22.761
<i> Oh, I figured it</i>
<i> was some kind of scam,</i>

25:22.913 --> 25:25.689
but... if a hound's
hungry enough,

25:25.841 --> 25:27.608
she'll do anything
for her next meal.

25:28.936 --> 25:31.270
I had no clue where I was going,
but the moment

25:31.422 --> 25:34.114
<i> we made our first stop,</i>
<i> I knew I was in trouble.</i>

25:39.613 --> 25:41.021
Everybody get inside.

25:41.098 --> 25:43.282
<i> TERI:</i>
<i> It looked more like</i>
<i> a massage parlor</i>

25:43.376 --> 25:45.042
<i> than a medical clinic,</i>
<i> and I figured</i>

25:45.193 --> 25:46.526
<i> any doctor who worked there</i>

25:46.620 --> 25:49.104
<i> shouldn't be</i>
<i> prescribing aspirin,</i>

25:49.123 --> 25:51.197
<i> much less real drugs.</i>

25:51.217 --> 25:55.035
<i> But I quickly learned</i>
<i> that was the point.</i>

25:55.129 --> 25:57.780
<i> Those guys didn't even bother</i>
<i> with an exam.</i>

25:57.798 --> 26:01.466
<i> They just scribbled on a chart</i>
<i> and handed me scrips.</i>

26:01.619 --> 26:04.953
I didn't know what the drugs
were for, so I asked him.

26:05.047 --> 26:06.305
He didn't like that.

26:06.457 --> 26:09.141
After that, I learned
to keep my mouth shut.

26:09.293 --> 26:10.642
<i> Then they dropped us</i>
<i> at a pharmacy</i>

26:10.795 --> 26:13.219
<i> on the other side of town.</i>
<i> That's where I met Phoebe.</i>

26:13.314 --> 26:16.315
<i> All the other customers looked</i>
<i> at us like we were vermin.</i>

26:16.467 --> 26:19.392
<i> But not Phoebe. She was kind.</i>

26:19.412 --> 26:22.079
<i> Never asked any questions.</i>

26:22.230 --> 26:25.082
Her mom was sick.

26:25.233 --> 26:26.975
She needed the money.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.753
We all make mistakes.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.756
I guess she paid for hers.

26:32.908 --> 26:35.484
Oh, those bastards

26:35.577 --> 26:37.577
are scarier than hell.

26:37.597 --> 26:40.489
<i> Taron especially.</i>

26:40.507 --> 26:41.990
If you want your fee,
have your bags and prescriptions

26:42.084 --> 26:44.518
ready to be counted.

26:48.423 --> 26:49.923
First time?

26:50.092 --> 26:52.735
Welcome to the team.

26:53.838 --> 26:55.003
Yeah.

26:55.097 --> 26:56.338
Now, come back next week,

26:56.357 --> 26:58.365
there's more
where that came from.

27:00.435 --> 27:02.845
And if you say anything
to the cops, you'll regret it.

27:02.863 --> 27:04.163
Understand?

27:05.273 --> 27:08.033
<i> TERI:</i>
<i> I've been around the block,</i>

27:08.185 --> 27:10.443
<i> and I knew the pills</i>
<i> in my hand were worth</i>

27:10.463 --> 27:13.113
<i> a hell of a lot more</i>
<i> than 50 bucks.</i>

27:13.207 --> 27:15.299
So, I kept a little on the side.

27:15.526 --> 27:17.693
For street resale,
you know what I mean?

27:18.696 --> 27:20.620
Did anyone else keep pills
for themselves?

27:20.714 --> 27:23.307
Yeah, we all skimmed.

27:23.534 --> 27:25.643
Who were we cheating?
Bunch of crooks.

27:25.719 --> 27:28.145
That explains why
we've seen patients O.D.

27:28.296 --> 27:29.629
with those pills
in their pocket.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.149
And why you had a cancer drug

27:32.376 --> 27:34.042
with no cancer diagnosis.

27:34.061 --> 27:36.695
Where did they take the pills?

27:38.382 --> 27:40.157
I only saw the place once,

27:40.234 --> 27:42.993
from the outside.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.980
<i> Eventually, my curiosity</i>

27:46.999 --> 27:48.648
<i> got the best of me.</i>

27:48.742 --> 27:53.003
<i> And-and, one day, I finally</i>
<i> saw them by some warehouse.</i>

27:55.174 --> 27:57.065
<i> My guess is that's where</i>

27:57.084 --> 27:58.509
<i> the mob does its dirty work.</i>

27:58.736 --> 28:01.011
<i> Got to count the pills,</i>
<i> they repackage them,</i>

28:01.180 --> 28:03.347
<i> and then they resell them</i>
<i> back to the pharmacies</i>

28:03.498 --> 28:05.641
<i> for up to ten times</i>
<i> the original price.</i>

28:13.584 --> 28:15.250
CADE:
This is it.

28:15.269 --> 28:18.103
All the answers
we've been searching for.

28:18.255 --> 28:19.846
Once the FBI knows this...

28:19.940 --> 28:21.606
They'll shut that operation down

28:21.775 --> 28:23.033
in a heartbeat.

28:23.185 --> 28:25.035
But just remember our deal:

28:25.112 --> 28:28.021
you can tell the FBI,

28:28.098 --> 28:30.958
but keep my name out of it.

28:38.625 --> 28:42.094
Almost done with the
high T-spine pedicle screws.

28:44.281 --> 28:47.950
KIT: Let's shoot another
fluoro image.

28:47.968 --> 28:50.018
(beeps)

28:51.805 --> 28:53.397
How are those screws
coming along?

28:55.383 --> 28:56.734
You're getting a little close.

28:56.885 --> 28:59.385
We need to leave half an inch
more between those screws.

28:59.463 --> 29:02.573
Dr. Devi...

29:03.300 --> 29:04.483
-Dr. Devi!
-(gasps)

29:04.577 --> 29:05.817
(monitor beeping rapidly)

29:05.911 --> 29:08.320
-(stammers) What happened?
-You fell asleep.

29:08.489 --> 29:10.748
There's a massive bleed
in Ashley's spine.

29:10.975 --> 29:12.416
Cautery to me, now.

29:12.643 --> 29:14.084
We need two units of reds
up and hanging.

29:14.236 --> 29:16.495
-She's bleeding fast.
-LEELA: No, no, no.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.238
I asked you if you were ready
for this. You lied to me.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.717
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so...
-Go home, Dr. Devi, now.

29:32.587 --> 29:34.605
This is extraordinary.
With what you just told us,

29:34.756 --> 29:36.014
we should have enough
to get warrants,

29:36.166 --> 29:38.299
run surveillance, and with luck,

29:38.335 --> 29:40.335
bring down the entire drug ring.

29:40.428 --> 29:43.171
-Thank you both.
-Well, we're not the ones
you should thank.

29:43.190 --> 29:44.597
Yeah, well, tell your source
that the Bureau

29:44.617 --> 29:47.534
-is eternally grateful.
-We'll pass along the message.

29:49.029 --> 29:50.862
Always a pleasure, Dr. Sullivan.

29:51.015 --> 29:53.532
I hope for both our sake this is
the last time we work together.

29:53.684 --> 29:56.126
If you ever want
to hang up that white coat,

29:56.278 --> 29:57.294
there's a wide world

29:57.445 --> 29:58.945
of Medicare fraud out there.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.356
I prefer a stethoscope
over a handgun.

30:01.449 --> 30:03.550
Wise choice.

30:06.864 --> 30:09.306
Look at you.

30:09.457 --> 30:13.143
Saving lives and bringing down
the mob at the same time.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.554
-It was a team effort.
-Listen,

30:15.648 --> 30:19.724
I know what you said about
not wanting to get comfortable,

30:19.819 --> 30:21.151
but our job is done.

30:21.228 --> 30:23.821
It's time to start
living your life.

30:23.972 --> 30:26.064
-Same could be said of you.
-Oh.

30:26.141 --> 30:28.492
Okay, that's fair,
but I have a life,

30:28.643 --> 30:31.811
it's just centered
around my daughter. (laughs)

30:31.831 --> 30:33.572
No way.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.707
What?

30:46.995 --> 30:49.012
-Is that the guy
who killed Phoebe?
-Yeah.

30:49.164 --> 30:51.723
He saw us with the FBI.

30:53.427 --> 30:55.352
He saw me.

30:59.933 --> 31:01.433
Leela.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.419
-I need to talk to you.
-Take a number.

31:04.512 --> 31:06.346
I have a lot of sins
to account for today.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.031
Devon told me everything,

31:08.258 --> 31:09.867
about his offer.

31:10.018 --> 31:11.776
(scoffs)

31:11.871 --> 31:13.353
I cannot believe

31:13.447 --> 31:14.854
-he told you.
-Well, the question is,

31:14.874 --> 31:16.098
why didn't you?

31:16.191 --> 31:19.101
Can we not do this
right now, please?

31:19.119 --> 31:21.361
No, we're actually
gonna do this now.

31:21.455 --> 31:22.379
Okay.

31:22.606 --> 31:25.774
I didn't tell you
because it's insane.

31:25.792 --> 31:28.110
And I... I thought
of all people,

31:28.203 --> 31:29.778
you would agree.

31:29.796 --> 31:31.780
I don't, actually.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.148
Look, this thing with AJ,

31:33.150 --> 31:35.208
it's-it's really
not working out.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.637
And Devon could be
a good option for us.

31:38.731 --> 31:39.804
For us?

31:39.899 --> 31:41.123
No,

31:41.141 --> 31:42.958
it is not a good option for us.

31:42.976 --> 31:44.459
It is a good option for you

31:44.478 --> 31:46.737
-and only you.
-Look, I know it's
complicated, okay?

31:46.888 --> 31:48.238
But Devon's offer solves

31:48.390 --> 31:50.148
-a lot of problems.
-Oh, my God.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.242
Padma, would you listen
to yourself.

31:53.436 --> 31:55.078
I have given you everything,

31:55.230 --> 31:58.473
even the freaking eggs
from my body,

31:58.566 --> 32:00.809
but we cannot share this.
I will not

32:00.902 --> 32:02.544
give you Devon.

32:07.409 --> 32:08.592
(elevator dings)

32:17.269 --> 32:20.679
Unexpected complications?
What does that mean?

32:20.831 --> 32:23.774
One of the screws used
to reconstruct Ashley's spine

32:24.001 --> 32:25.350
caused a significant amount
of bleeding.

32:25.502 --> 32:28.503
-Will she be okay?
-Yes. With a little rest,

32:28.522 --> 32:31.173
I have no doubt your wife
will make a full recovery.

32:31.191 --> 32:34.509
That's a relief. Thank you.

32:34.602 --> 32:36.361
Um, where's Dr. Sutton?

32:36.455 --> 32:38.121
She got pulled into
an emergency surgery,

32:38.290 --> 32:39.772
but she'll be by
as soon as she can.

32:39.866 --> 32:41.607
And Dr. Devi?

32:42.628 --> 32:45.278
You can spend the night
in Ashley's room, if you like.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.539
The hospital will provide a cot.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.950
Loved ones help
the healing process.

32:51.044 --> 32:53.470
Call if you need anything.

32:54.956 --> 32:56.289
So, I-I got your text.

32:56.366 --> 32:57.790
Did you know Dr. Devi

32:57.884 --> 33:01.144
was pulling double duty in
cardiothoracic and neurosurgery?

33:01.221 --> 33:02.795
I think everybody was aware.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.964
But Leela is
an excellent surgeon.

33:05.058 --> 33:06.632
She's...

33:06.652 --> 33:08.819
she's just trying to do more
and be better

33:08.970 --> 33:10.303
than any human can be.

33:10.472 --> 33:12.731
Today, her patient paid
the price for that arrogance.

33:12.883 --> 33:14.974
What happened in the OR
could've been catastrophic.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.551
I know, I agree,

33:16.570 --> 33:18.220
and so does Billie.
We've had many conversations

33:18.313 --> 33:19.738
about her stretching herself
too thin.

33:19.890 --> 33:21.665
It's past time someone had
that conversation with Leela.

33:21.816 --> 33:26.294
She has to make a decision,
or I will make it for her.

33:39.426 --> 33:40.684
Hey.

33:43.022 --> 33:45.022
You don't look so good.

33:45.173 --> 33:46.581
(sighs) I'm not.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.267
I've lost everything today.

33:49.419 --> 33:52.070
My future child
and my own sister.

33:56.777 --> 33:57.993
May I join you?

34:03.767 --> 34:04.708
Listen.

34:06.937 --> 34:09.337
I grew up in foster care.

34:10.698 --> 34:13.625
-I didn't know that.
-Moved from house to house,

34:13.777 --> 34:17.370
never had a place to call home.

34:17.447 --> 34:19.539
It made me resentful and angry

34:19.633 --> 34:20.891
because all I wanted

34:21.042 --> 34:22.801
was stability, right?

34:22.895 --> 34:26.229
So, the very idea of you
raising our child

34:26.456 --> 34:28.548
in a van...

34:28.567 --> 34:29.974
Well, it was triggering.

34:30.127 --> 34:32.903
I see.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.404
And I'm sorry.

34:34.631 --> 34:38.408
I'm sorry, too.
You know, I-I made this about

34:38.560 --> 34:41.453
my past when it should've been
about your future.

34:42.489 --> 34:45.082
But you did ask me
to be the father,

34:45.233 --> 34:47.475
not some stranger.

34:47.477 --> 34:50.420
So, you would have to
meet me halfway.

34:51.498 --> 34:53.331
Padma, I can't help you
bring a child

34:53.425 --> 34:55.074
into this world
and then abandon it.

34:55.168 --> 34:56.927
This would be your baby

34:57.154 --> 34:59.988
as much as it would be mine.

35:00.081 --> 35:02.006
And you should tell your story.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.100
But I cannot watch

35:03.251 --> 35:06.252
my child grow up
from the sidelines.

35:06.346 --> 35:08.438
I need a relationship,
a connection.

35:08.665 --> 35:10.423
And if that's not what
you're looking for,

35:10.592 --> 35:13.110
then I'm willing
to bow out gracefully.

35:13.261 --> 35:16.613
But you are going to
have to find someone else.

35:20.694 --> 35:22.285
(sighs)

35:22.395 --> 35:24.538
You're a good man, Dr. Austin.

35:27.775 --> 35:30.752
I think our child
should witness that firsthand.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.298
Our child?

35:36.526 --> 35:39.302
-You sure about that?
-You were right.

35:39.529 --> 35:41.972
It was wrong of me to trivialize
your involvement.

35:42.123 --> 35:44.790
It takes a village
to raise a child,

35:44.810 --> 35:46.309
if you're still willing.

35:47.721 --> 35:50.038
Absolutely, I am.
(chuckles)

35:50.056 --> 35:52.298
(sighs)

35:52.467 --> 35:55.134
But just so you know,
the van is a deal-breaker.

35:55.228 --> 35:58.713
Fine, but you need to ease up
on the Ivy League talk.

35:58.732 --> 36:01.383
Let's let our child decide
what their future looks like.

36:01.401 --> 36:03.551
Hey, you saying you don't want
a 529 account?

36:03.645 --> 36:04.977
I never said that.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.905
God knows how much college
is gonna cost in 18 years.

36:07.073 --> 36:09.291
(laughs)

36:16.566 --> 36:18.508
-CONRAD: What are your options?
-I leave tonight.

36:18.660 --> 36:19.918
It may seem impulsive,

36:20.070 --> 36:21.252
but I'm pretty sure that's how

36:21.405 --> 36:23.847
-I've stayed alive so far.
-That's one option.

36:23.998 --> 36:26.349
What else?

36:26.501 --> 36:28.393
I quit running.

36:30.397 --> 36:33.356
Try to build a life for myself.

36:35.419 --> 36:37.510
Make friends
I can keep over time,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.754
put down roots.

36:39.773 --> 36:43.107
But I'd risk that, one day,
I'd find myself

36:43.276 --> 36:45.452
bleeding on the pavement.

36:48.932 --> 36:50.665
I don't want to go.

36:52.269 --> 36:53.543
I've felt more at home here

36:53.712 --> 36:57.631
than I did as a kid
in my own home, honestly.

36:58.942 --> 37:01.033
(sniffles)

37:01.053 --> 37:03.111
What was your home like?

37:03.129 --> 37:06.264
My parents divorced
when I was young.

37:07.801 --> 37:09.559
Same here.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.956
I was raised by my dad,

37:14.975 --> 37:17.525
a man-child genius surgeon.

37:19.980 --> 37:22.647
I was the gardener,
he was the flower.

37:22.799 --> 37:25.650
Mm, the dots are connecting.

37:25.727 --> 37:26.743
(chuckles)

37:29.397 --> 37:31.706
All this will be over soon.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.310
Why are you still running?

37:35.328 --> 37:37.312
We spoke to Agent Barker.

37:37.330 --> 37:39.238
They have everything they need
to shut this down,

37:39.332 --> 37:42.408
and your FBI protection
is right outside.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.653
They're gonna put me
in a hotel for the night.

37:45.672 --> 37:48.823
Try and find the man we saw
and arrest him.

37:48.842 --> 37:50.642
And when they do...

37:53.997 --> 37:55.689
...you could stay.

37:58.685 --> 38:01.987
Create that life you want, here.

38:03.523 --> 38:07.367
The people who want to kill me
have more than one soldier.

38:11.848 --> 38:13.498
I hear that.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.379
I'm so tired.

38:21.282 --> 38:23.858
Tired of running.

38:23.951 --> 38:27.053
Tired of... fear.

38:35.722 --> 38:37.522
(sniffles)

38:45.549 --> 38:48.658
Why don't you just
give it the night?

38:49.903 --> 38:53.071
I'll walk you out,
make sure the FBI tail's

38:53.165 --> 38:54.998
got your back.

38:58.912 --> 39:01.963
Yeah, just this once.

39:10.407 --> 39:12.407
Hey.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.267
You're up.

39:15.412 --> 39:17.020
I thought you'd be
passed out by now.

39:17.247 --> 39:19.764
I slept for a few hours.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.475
I'm awake now.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.846
-So, how'd your surgery go?
-I don't know.

39:28.015 --> 39:31.034
I was asked to leave after
I nearly paralyzed my patient.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.192
What happened?

39:40.212 --> 39:42.787
It doesn't matter.

39:42.923 --> 39:46.383
Kit gave me a week
to pick a specialty.

39:46.534 --> 39:49.110
So, you were right.

39:49.129 --> 39:51.471
I can't do it all.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.284
You push yourself too hard.

39:56.377 --> 39:58.953
It's as if you have
something to prove.

39:58.972 --> 40:02.065
I do have something to prove.

40:02.292 --> 40:04.401
I know you talked to Padma.

40:04.552 --> 40:06.978
Why would you go behind
my back like that?

40:07.072 --> 40:08.796
You knew exactly how I felt.

40:08.815 --> 40:11.074
How would I?

40:11.301 --> 40:13.910
You don't even talk
to me about it.

40:14.137 --> 40:16.579
I should not have to explain

40:16.806 --> 40:18.973
why I don't want my boyfriend
to have a baby

40:19.066 --> 40:20.583
-with my sister.
-That's not true.

40:20.735 --> 40:23.086
I was trying to help,
and I wish I never had.

40:23.237 --> 40:25.422
But why can't you be honest
with me about it?

40:26.816 --> 40:30.427
You do not want me
to be honest with you, Devon.

40:30.578 --> 40:33.972
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

40:35.659 --> 40:38.326
I don't want kids.

40:38.344 --> 40:41.012
Not now, not in a few years,

40:41.106 --> 40:43.606
maybe never, okay?

40:47.854 --> 40:49.187
So, you lied to me.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.506
I think, deep down,
we both knew.

40:51.524 --> 40:54.451
-I didn't know.
-Why else would you offer
to father

40:54.527 --> 40:55.843
another woman's baby?

40:56.012 --> 40:57.361
This isn't about Padma.

40:57.514 --> 40:59.122
You led me on.

40:59.199 --> 41:01.332
Made me think that
there was a chance.

41:02.443 --> 41:04.109
A future for us.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.704
And now there isn't?

41:06.798 --> 41:08.465
A future for us?

41:11.027 --> 41:12.376
I love you.

41:12.529 --> 41:14.095
But not enough.

41:16.032 --> 41:18.366
You want a baby
more than you want me.

41:18.384 --> 41:20.626
I want you.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.270
I want us.

41:23.297 --> 41:25.206
But I also want
a family one day,

41:25.225 --> 41:27.567
and I never hid that from you.

41:28.728 --> 41:31.070
I'm not gonna apologize for it.

41:33.733 --> 41:37.327
I'm not going to apologize
for wanting something different.

41:38.980 --> 41:40.371
(Leela sighs)

41:41.241 --> 41:43.416
So, what are you saying then?

41:44.836 --> 41:45.985
That this is it?

41:46.079 --> 41:48.129
This is the end?

41:54.587 --> 41:57.263
Yeah. I guess I am.

41:58.742 --> 42:00.642
(crying)

42:01.761 --> 42:03.728
♪ ♪

42:12.864 --> 42:14.255
(door closes)

42:14.274 --> 42:16.440
(soft piano music playing)

42:16.535 --> 42:19.277
So, we haven't got a verdict
on the venue,

42:19.371 --> 42:21.687
but we both agree it should...

42:21.706 --> 42:24.040
-BOTH: Be small.
-We'll invite a few friends

42:24.117 --> 42:26.042
and figure the rest out
as we go.

42:26.193 --> 42:27.877
Either way,
it's gonna be perfect.

42:28.104 --> 42:31.089
Well, not quite.

42:32.625 --> 42:36.035
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.
-(both laugh)

42:36.054 --> 42:37.612
I would hate
to disappoint you, darling.

42:37.630 --> 42:41.040
That would be a terrible way
to start a marriage.
