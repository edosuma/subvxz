WEBVTT

00:08.709 --> 00:11.441
HEY, BURKE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
YOU WROTE ON THIS MARKET LIST.

00:11.442 --> 00:14.484
- UM, "NO FAYO"?
- NON-FAT YOGURT.

00:14.485 --> 00:17.717
OH OKAY. WHAT ABOUT
"WAH WEE PEN"?

00:17.718 --> 00:20.090
WHOLE WHEAT PENNE.

00:20.091 --> 00:22.452
HOW COULD I NOT SEE THAT ONE?
UM...

00:22.453 --> 00:25.695
"MAX FLO TAMP"?

00:25.696 --> 00:28.498
- THINK ABOUT IT.
- OH, I GOT IT.

00:28.499 --> 00:32.263
SEE IF YOU CAN DECODE THIS:
"NOT-A-FRIGGING-CHANCE."

00:35.606 --> 00:38.638
JOE, HAVE YOU SEEN MY GOOD BLACK JEANS?
I CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL IN MY PAJAMAS.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.411
- WASHED AND IN YOUR ROOM.
- THEY'RE NOT IN MY ROOM.

00:41.412 --> 00:44.074
- FIVE BUCKS SAYS THAT THEY ARE.
- 10 SAYS THEY'RE NOT.

00:44.075 --> 00:45.575
- 20.
- 50.

00:45.576 --> 00:47.348
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ON.

00:48.679 --> 00:49.679
IT'S KINDA FUNNY...

00:49.680 --> 00:51.551
YOU'RE NOT A MOM, BUT
YOU HAVE TWO KIDS;

00:51.552 --> 00:53.783
YOU'RE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP,
YET YOU LIVE WITH A GUY;

00:53.784 --> 00:56.257
AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ON A
REAL DATE IN SIX WEEKS.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.689
12.

00:59.690 --> 01:03.062
- NO, I AM TOTALLY FULFILLED IN MY NEW LIFE.
- OH.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.764
BUT TELL ME, RHONDA, ARE
THERE STILL MEN OUT THERE

01:04.765 --> 01:07.537
AND DO THEY STILL TAKE WOMEN ON
ROMANTIC DATES TO RESTAURANTS

01:07.538 --> 01:10.701
- AND TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM?
- THEY DO, GOD BLESS THEM.

01:11.602 --> 01:14.104
OH GOD, I MISS THAT.

01:14.105 --> 01:15.575
Ryder: LOOK AT ME, I'M RICH!

01:15.576 --> 01:17.747
DOUBLE OR NOTHING SAYS
THAT THEY'RE IN THE DRYER.

01:17.748 --> 01:19.349
OH HEY LOOK, WE NEVER
REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS,

01:19.350 --> 01:21.681
- BUT FRIDAY IS PAYDAY, RIGHT?
- UH-HUH.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.355
GOOD. I MIGHT NEED
A SMALL ADVANCE.

01:25.356 --> 01:28.418
INTERESTING FACT: BEFORE THIS HE
ACTUALLY RAN AN ENTIRE COMPANY.

01:28.419 --> 01:32.193
LOOK, WE LOST A BILLION DOLLARS,
BUT WE NEVER LOST OUR PANTS.

01:35.726 --> 01:38.168
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:38.169 --> 01:39.830
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:44.635 --> 01:47.177
- SOUNDS LIKE A DATE.
- IT IS NOT A DATE.

01:47.178 --> 01:50.340
THEO JUST WANTS TO DISCUSS ARTS
FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH ME

01:50.341 --> 01:53.112
AT THAT REALLY COOL NEW DIM SUM PLACE
WHERE ALL THE COUPLES HANG OUT.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.146
OOOH, HE TOTALLY ASKED YOU OUT.

01:56.147 --> 01:58.348
CAN WE NOT BE
TWEENAGERS ABOUT THIS?

01:58.349 --> 02:00.520
HE TOTALLY DID.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.693
OH, AND HE'S, LIKE, SO CUTE!

02:03.694 --> 02:07.627
SO IS HE GIVING OFF ANY SIGNS?
DOES HE SEEM INTERESTED?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.759
WELL, I DETECTED SEVERAL GLANCES

02:09.760 --> 02:12.131
AT SELECTED PORTIONS OF ME.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.404
ARE WE TALKING
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?

02:14.405 --> 02:16.806
THE COUNCILWOMAN HAS
HIM UNDER REVIEW.

02:16.807 --> 02:18.809
( giggles )

02:21.712 --> 02:23.843
- GIRL TALK?
- JUST BUSINESS.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.417
YES, WE WERE REVIEWING
CRITICAL PERSONNEL ISSUES.

02:27.418 --> 02:29.720
SO THEN GIRL TALK.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.683
I THINK THIS IS GREAT,
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT,

02:33.684 --> 02:35.485
THESE DAYS YOU'RE NOT OUT
THERE HITTING THE CLUBS.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.687
AND NOTHING'S HITTING ME.

02:37.688 --> 02:41.261
SO WHAT'S YOUR NEXT
MOVE WITH THEO?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.793
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO
BE UNPROFESSIONAL.

02:43.794 --> 02:46.466
I'M LYING. I WANT TO
BE SO UNPROFESSIONAL.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.668
LIKE, "SLAP ME WITH A
LAWSUIT" UNPROFESSIONAL.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.870
OH, HE'S REALLY ADORABLE.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.504
LADIES, PLEASE, AT LEAST WAIT
TILL I'M OUT OF THE ROOM.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.578
BUT I CAN'T JUST BE HITTING ON
THE GUY WHEN HE'S LOBBYING ME.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.751
- ISN'T THAT CROSSING THE LINE?
- SO MAKE HIM CROSS IT FIRST.

03:01.752 --> 03:04.254
LET HIM GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME
AFTER THE NEXT MEETING.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.356
THEN ASK HIM IF HE
WANTS TO COME INSIDE.

03:06.357 --> 03:10.290
A LITTLE CHITCHAT, FLASH THOSE BABY BLUES.
DO I HAVE TO SPELL THIS OUT?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.921
NO, I HAVE MEMORIES.

03:11.922 --> 03:15.725
AND A VIDEOTAPE ONE OF
MY OLD BOYFRIENDS MADE.

03:15.726 --> 03:18.398
MAN, I LOOKED GOOD IN THAT TAPE.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.732
YOU SHOULD TRANSFER IT TO
DIGITAL SO YOU DON'T LOSE IT.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.476
AND THEN ENCRYPT THE
CRAP OUT OF IT.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.279
OOOH, GOTTA GO. I HAVE A DATE.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.613
WELL, NOT TECHNICALLY. I'M
INTERVIEWING NEW INTERNS.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.945
OH HEY, LET ME HELP
YOU WITH THAT.

03:35.946 --> 03:38.489
NO NO NO, I GOT IT, I GOT IT. IT'S
PERFECTLY BALANCED. PLEASE DON'T...

03:40.421 --> 03:41.752
Both: SEE?

03:43.654 --> 03:45.395
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

03:45.396 --> 03:47.827
ALL RIGHT, THAT IS IT.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.329
I'M ALL MOVED IN.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.731
NICE.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.964
WALL, FLOOR, WEIGHT BENCH,

03:54.965 --> 03:57.807
ALL THE COMFORTS OF
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

03:57.808 --> 03:59.739
WHERE DO YOU SLEEP?

03:59.740 --> 04:03.813
THIS BABY. THE THING
INFLATES IN LIKE 30 SECONDS.

04:03.814 --> 04:05.445
( beeps )

04:05.446 --> 04:07.848
( slow hissing )

04:10.481 --> 04:11.921
WOW.

04:11.922 --> 04:14.324
LOOK AT IT GO.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.256
I'D BETTER GET OUT OF THE WAY.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.733
- YOU'RE GOOD, BURKE.
- SERIOUSLY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU AND TIFFANY

04:23.734 --> 04:25.735
WERE GOING HALFSIES
ON ALL YOUR STUFF.

04:25.736 --> 04:28.838
YEAH, THIS IS MY... HALF.

04:28.839 --> 04:31.040
OH, SO WHEN YOU DIVIDED
THINGS EQUALLY

04:31.041 --> 04:33.703
YOU GOT ALL THE INVISIBLE STUFF?

04:33.704 --> 04:36.476
LOOK, TIFFANY IS GOING TO BE ON
HER OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.448
OKAY? AND SHE'S NEVER WORKED.

04:38.449 --> 04:40.810
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
SHE WAS GOING TO BE OKAY.

04:40.811 --> 04:42.682
I'M TRYING TO BE A
STANDUP GUY HERE.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.054
YOU'RE KINDA MORE
OF A BENT-OVER GUY.

04:45.055 --> 04:48.057
I'M SORRY. LOOK... I JUST GET...

04:48.058 --> 04:51.290
- YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
- WHAT? NO. SAY IT.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.864
I GET THE FEELING THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT
IF YOU LET HER KEEP ALL THE STUFF,

04:54.865 --> 04:57.367
THAT SHE'LL CHANGE HER
MIND AND TAKE YOU BACK.

04:57.368 --> 05:00.670
PLEASE! I GOT
EVERYTHING I WANTED.

05:00.671 --> 05:02.702
REALLY?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.504
I BET YOU HAD A TV.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.476
A GUY LIKE YOU
PROBABLY HAD A 60",

05:06.477 --> 05:09.809
1080p, H.D., LCD, L.E.D.
MAN-AVISION?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.881
52", WHICH IS PLENTY.

05:11.882 --> 05:14.984
THE FACT OF THE MATTER
IS YOU NOW HAVE 0".

05:14.985 --> 05:17.316
THAT IS BY CHOICE, OKAY?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.089
SHE'S GOING TO BE SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME AT HOME AND SHE THOUGHT...

05:20.090 --> 05:22.752
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
BEST IF SHE TOOK THE TV.

05:22.753 --> 05:25.525
LIKE I SAID, 0".

05:25.526 --> 05:27.757
YOU'RE A NICE GUY, BUT
YOU'RE GETTING KILLED HERE.

05:27.758 --> 05:31.362
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR, BECAUSE I'M REALLY
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE.

05:33.564 --> 05:35.765
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
THAT IS HILARIOUS.

05:35.766 --> 05:38.668
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

05:38.669 --> 05:41.571
- HA HA HA!
- OH COME ON, SHARE!

05:41.572 --> 05:43.773
I BOUGHT EVERYTHING
YOU'RE WEARING.

05:43.774 --> 05:47.116
OKAY, SO AIDEN, HE THINKS HE'S LIKE
A SUPER DRIVER. TODAY AFTER SCHOOL,

05:47.117 --> 05:49.719
HE BACKS HIS BEEMER RIGHT INTO
THE HEADMASTER'S MERCEDES.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.622
SO THEY END UP HAVING TO CALL AIDEN'S
DAD IN ZURICH, AND HE GOES...

05:52.623 --> 05:55.655
WAIT WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE WERE
A LOT OF BIG-MONEY WORDS THERE.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.987
SINCE WHEN ARE THERE
HEADMASTERS AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS?

05:57.988 --> 06:00.660
THEY'RE NOT. THIS
HAPPENED AT McALISTER.

06:00.661 --> 06:01.891
McALISTER?

06:01.892 --> 06:04.564
YOU MEAN McPREPPY
McSNOOTY ACADEMY?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.666
THE ONE YOU'RE
GLAD TO BE OUT OF?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.498
EVERYBODY I KNOW IS STILL THERE.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.370
WHAT ABOUT MAKING SOME NEW FRIENDS?
AT GRANT.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.143
WHERE YOU GO EVERY DAY FOR EIGHT HOURS...
OR SO I'M TOLD.

06:14.144 --> 06:16.576
I ALREADY HAVE FRIENDS.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.008
YES, BUT THOSE FRIENDS WILL
GIVE YOU CARPAL TUNNEL.

06:19.009 --> 06:22.682
HERE'S A CRAZY THOUGHT: WHAT
ABOUT MAKING SOME FRIENDS

06:22.683 --> 06:25.716
YOU CAN TALK TO EVEN IN A BLACKOUT?
O.M.G!

06:28.519 --> 06:30.790
I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.593
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE.
GET TO KNOW THEM.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.865
THEN MAYBE YOU CAN GET THEIR
NUMBERS AND TEXT THEM.

06:35.866 --> 06:37.827
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T GET IT.

06:37.828 --> 06:40.770
BURKE, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
TIFFANY'S BEEN PUSHING ME AROUND

06:40.771 --> 06:43.002
AND I NEED TO STAND UP
FOR MYSELF AND BE A MAN.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.636
I'M GETTING MY INCHES BACK...
ALL OF THEM.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.142
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT TELEVISIONS.

07:04.094 --> 07:07.797
LENNOX, IT'S A PUBLIC HEARING TONIGHT
AND THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF BLOWHARDS,

07:07.798 --> 07:09.859
- SO IT MIGHT GO LATE.
- UH-HUH.

07:09.860 --> 07:14.063
AND FLYING MONKEYS MIGHT
CARRY ME OFF INTO THE NIGHT.

07:14.064 --> 07:16.065
YOU KNOW, I DO LISTEN TO YOU.

07:16.066 --> 07:18.608
I JUST DON'T FIND MUCH
OF IT VERY INTERESTING.

07:18.609 --> 07:20.710
OH, YOU DO LISTEN TO ME.

07:20.711 --> 07:24.013
OH, YOU'RE WEARING THE
SPECIAL-OCCASION EARRINGS.

07:24.014 --> 07:26.846
IS THERE GOING TO BE A VERY
SPECIAL BLOWHARD THERE TONIGHT?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.447
NO, I JUST... IT'S...

07:28.448 --> 07:30.219
YEAH, UH-HUH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

07:30.220 --> 07:33.753
- THEO MORTON.
- WHAT'S HE DO?

07:33.754 --> 07:36.455
HE'S DEPUTY VICE-CHAIR ON
THE MAYOR'S COMMISSION

07:36.456 --> 07:38.628
OF ARTS CURRICULA
AND PUBLIC FUNDING.

07:38.629 --> 07:42.563
OOOH, A BAD BOY!

07:43.864 --> 07:45.995
- I BET HE WEARS SUITS.
- HE DOES NOT!

07:45.996 --> 07:48.097
OKAY YEAH, HE DOES, BUT...

07:48.098 --> 07:51.671
OH MY GOD, I JUST LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW.
YOU GUYS GOTTA SEE WHAT'S COMING.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.903
HEY, THANKS, BUDDY.

07:53.904 --> 07:56.045
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

07:56.046 --> 07:57.907
HA.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.650
- JOE, CAN I TOUCH IT?
- NO.

08:00.651 --> 08:02.813
ALL RIGHT, BUT GO WASH
YOUR HANDS FIRST.

08:04.655 --> 08:07.787
- I THINK I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
- THIS IS A LITTLE PIECE OF MY DIGNITY.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.820
WENT OVER TO TALK TO TIFFANY. BEST
CONVERSATION WE HAVE HAD SINCE...

08:10.821 --> 08:13.823
SINCE YOU WENT BROKE AND
THEN SHE DUMPED YOU?

08:13.824 --> 08:16.827
THAT'S A WAY TO
CUSHION IT, YEAH.

08:18.529 --> 08:19.799
ANYWAY, I STATED MY POSITION.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.702
SHE LISTENED. AND I AM BACK
WITH TANGIBLE RESULTS.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.734
YEAH, A BEAUTIFUL BIG-ASS TV.

08:24.735 --> 08:27.006
WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE AROUND
THE TELEVISION, OKAY?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.908
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING WITH THAT?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.880
LET THE KID TAKE IT FOR A SPIN.

08:30.881 --> 08:33.282
LISTEN, I HAVE TO THANK YOU. IT'S
BECAUSE OF YOU THAT I GOT THAT TV BACK.

08:33.283 --> 08:35.545
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT STAYING
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

08:35.546 --> 08:37.887
BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT
IS WHAT I DID NOT COME BACK WITH.

08:37.888 --> 08:40.590
- I'M SERIOUS, IT'S NOT.
- MY AWESOME LEATHER CLUB CHAIR.

08:40.591 --> 08:43.522
I WANTED THAT TOO. BUT TIFFANY
WOULD NOT LET THAT GO.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.155
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
- THE TV'S NOT STAYING?

08:46.156 --> 08:49.559
NO, THIS MEANS SHE'S
NOT READY TO LET GO.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.302
YOU SEE, THAT CHAIR... IS ME.

08:53.303 --> 08:56.005
AND TIFFANY IS?

08:56.006 --> 08:58.708
STILL TIFFANY.

08:58.709 --> 09:01.612
BUT SHE'S SITTING ON ME.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.116
OKAY, SO YOU THINK THAT
SHE MIGHT WANT YOU BACK

09:07.117 --> 09:09.579
BECAUSE SHE'S KEEPING A CHAIR?

09:09.580 --> 09:11.550
TWO PLUS TWO,

09:11.551 --> 09:12.823
FOUR EVERY TIME.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.855
OH, IT LOOKS GREAT.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.758
LOOK, I PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO
THE DESIGN OF THE ROOM HERE,

09:18.759 --> 09:21.260
AND FRAT HOUSE REC ROOM IS
NOT PART OF THE SCHEME.

09:21.261 --> 09:25.965
- C'MON, AUNT MEL, IT'S HIGH-DEF!
- AND I'M LOW TOLERANCE.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.068
- BESIDES IT'S JOE'S TV.
- IT'S FINE. IT CAN LIVE UP HERE.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.071
ACTUALLY DOWNSTAIRS WOULD
BE SO MUCH BETTER.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.804
YOU KNOW, RYDER, DOWNSTAIRS
WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER.

09:34.805 --> 09:39.248
NO, YOU CAN'T! THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
THIS HOUSE HAS OFFICIALLY NOT SUCKED.

09:39.249 --> 09:42.712
WOW, IT'S NICE THAT
YOU DON'T HOLD BACK.

09:42.713 --> 09:45.985
RYDER, LOOK, I KNOW YOU LIKE IT, BUT IF
MY INTERIOR DECORATOR EVER SAW THIS...

09:45.986 --> 09:48.818
OH MY GOD! BABY PENGUINS.

09:48.819 --> 09:50.660
( cheeping )

09:50.661 --> 09:52.892
- SIT.
- NO.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.794
OH, THEY'RE SO CUTE.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.595
AND CRISP.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.228
I WANT A PENGUIN.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.735
I COULDN'T TELL HOW
I WAS DOING THERE.

10:05.736 --> 10:08.678
I MEAN, SOME OF THE OLD GUYS ON THE
CITY COUNCIL ARE PRETTY TOUGH.

10:08.679 --> 10:12.111
GUNDERSON WAS JUST STARING AT ME WITH THIS
BLANK, CREEPY EXPRESSION THE WHOLE TIME.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.314
OH, DON'T MIND HIM. HE
DIED THREE YEARS AGO.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.687
OKAY, THEN I WON'T
TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

10:17.688 --> 10:19.618
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE THE VOTES?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.652
WELL, JUST BECAUSE IT'S YOU,
I CALLED IN A FEW FAVORS.

10:22.653 --> 10:24.093
WHAT KIND OF FAVORS?

10:24.094 --> 10:26.796
VOTEY FAVORS. JUST FOR YOU.

10:26.797 --> 10:30.860
WOW. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.802
THAT IS THE GOAL.

10:32.803 --> 10:36.166
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN AND...
COME IN?

10:37.167 --> 10:39.638
( cheering )

10:39.639 --> 10:41.240
GO, BABY. WHOO!

10:41.241 --> 10:43.813
- WHAT IS THIS?
- THIS IS AN AMAZING COMEBACK IS WHAT THIS IS.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.815
THE BENGALS WERE DOWN BY
14 POINTS TWO MINUTES AGO.

10:45.816 --> 10:48.848
- NOW THEY'RE EVEN. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
- NO, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.150
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS
INTO THE KITCHEN?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.953
- WHO'S GOT THE BALL?
- Both: CHARGERS.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.756
WOW, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.888
THEO!

10:58.889 --> 11:00.329
THEY'RE GOING FOR
IT ON FOURTH DOWN?!

11:00.330 --> 11:02.231
- IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF GAME, MAN.
- LOOK, THEO...

11:02.232 --> 11:04.834
( cheers )

11:04.835 --> 11:07.166
DID YOU SEE THAT INTERCEPTION?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.399
YES, I DID.

11:15.746 --> 11:18.007
SO BEFORE I BRIEF YOU, BRIEF ME:

11:18.008 --> 11:19.949
HOW DID IT GO WITH THEO MORTON,

11:19.950 --> 11:22.782
THE ORLANDO BLOOM OF
OHIO ARTS FUNDING?

11:22.783 --> 11:26.015
HAVE WE SEGUED FROM LOBBYIST TO
POTENTIAL DOWN-THE-LINE BOYFRIEND?

11:26.016 --> 11:28.287
I HAD HIM. I WAS THIS CLOSE.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.720
THEN I LOST HIM BY
TWO TOUCHDOWNS.

11:30.721 --> 11:33.923
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- JOE MADE HIM WATCH FOOTBALL.

11:33.924 --> 11:35.995
MY NANNY STOLE MY DATE!

11:35.996 --> 11:38.768
OH MAN, WHEN I SAW YOU AND
THEO LEAVING TOGETHER,

11:38.769 --> 11:41.871
- I THOUGHT "THIS IS IT. THE DROUGHT IS OVER."
- SO DID I.

11:41.872 --> 11:44.804
BUT THEN IT ALL TURNED TO CRAP...
IN HIGH-DEF.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.236
THAT'S IT, I GOTTA EXPLAIN
SOME RULES TO JOE...

11:47.237 --> 11:48.808
WHAT CAN AND CANNOT
HAPPEN UNDER MY ROOF.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.811
YEAH, LET HIM HAVE IT HARD SO
YOU'RE NOT SNAPPING AT ME ALL DAY.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.382
I NEVER DO THAT! OH, I'M SORRY.

11:53.383 --> 11:55.045
CAN YOU JUST WAIT
IN THE CAR FOR ME?

12:00.791 --> 12:02.451
- JOE.
- BURKE.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.423
UH, WE NEED TO GO
OVER A FEW THINGS.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.856
LOOK, IF IT'S ABOUT THE
SOY MILK, I'M SORRY.

12:06.857 --> 12:09.328
I THREW IT OUT BECAUSE
I THOUGHT IT WENT BAD.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.331
I HAD NO IDEA THAT GOD-AWFUL
ODOR WAS THE CORRECT SMELL.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.464
- NO NO NO, THIS IS MORE GLOBAL.
- AUNT MEL, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

12:15.465 --> 12:18.007
- IN A MINUTE, LENNOX.
- NO, IT'LL BE REALLY FAST, I PROMISE.

12:18.008 --> 12:20.409
OKAY, SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT ME NOT MAKING FRIENDS

12:20.410 --> 12:24.944
AT MY NEW SCHOOL AND NOT MOVING ON
WITH MY LIFE SO I'VE MADE A DECISION.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.916
- I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY OLD SCHOOL.
- AH!

12:26.917 --> 12:29.919
THE ONE THAT'S TWO HOURS
AND $40,000 AWAY?

12:29.920 --> 12:32.922
YEAH, BUT THEY GIVE YOU LUNCH.

12:32.923 --> 12:35.355
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS TONIGHT.
- YES WE WILL.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.988
SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW TO READ YOU.

12:38.989 --> 12:41.931
AND THAT WOULD BE MY
SEGUE BACK TO YOU.

12:41.932 --> 12:45.264
HERE'S THE THING: WHEN I BRING A GUY
HOME, LIKE FOR INSTANCE LAST NIGHT,

12:45.265 --> 12:49.899
IT WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLY PREFERABLE IF
THERE WAS NO SPORTS BAR RIGHT HERE.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.470
- SO THEO WAS FROM WORK?
- YES.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.072
- BUT YOU WERE TRYING TO...
- YEAH.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.304
- AND THEN HE SAW THE TV...
- YES YES AND THEN NO,

12:55.305 --> 12:57.076
SO THEREFORE NO!

12:57.077 --> 12:59.478
WOW, TALK ABOUT
MISSING A SIGNAL.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.181
- THIS TO YOU IS AN APOLOGY?
- IT'S NOT MY MISSED SIGNAL.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.313
I'M NOT THE ONE THAT MESSED
UP YOUR NIGHT, BURKE.

13:04.314 --> 13:06.816
- TRUST ME, THAT NIGHT WAS GOING NOWHERE.
- AH! HA HA.

13:06.817 --> 13:08.918
- WE WERE HEADED SOMEWHERE.
- REALLY?

13:08.919 --> 13:11.490
I MEAN, COME ON. THE GUY
STARTED WATCHING THE GAME.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.863
- SO? HE'S A GUY.
- EXACTLY.

13:13.864 --> 13:16.325
WHEN A GUY IS INTO YOU, HE'S
THINKING WITH HIS MAN PARTS, OKAY?

13:16.326 --> 13:19.829
AND MAN PARTS? THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT HIGH-DEF.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.901
AH, RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS
FROM A GUY WHO THINKS A WOMAN

13:21.902 --> 13:24.103
STILL LOVES HIM BECAUSE
SHE'S KEEPING HIS CHAIR.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.175
HEY, THAT CHAIR IS SIGNIFICANT.

13:26.176 --> 13:29.338
MOVE ON! SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

13:29.339 --> 13:30.940
DON'T GET MAD AT ME, ALL RIGHT?

13:30.941 --> 13:33.512
I'M NOT THE ONE THAT MESSED UP
YOUR LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL CRUSH.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.584
- OH, IT WAS NOT A SCHOOLGIRL CRUSH.
- ( beeps )

13:35.585 --> 13:37.586
OOOH, A TEXT FROM THEO!

13:37.587 --> 13:41.421
OH, YOU ARE SO GONNA EAT YOUR WORDS.
CHECK THIS OUT.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.993
"DINNER TONIGHT."

13:43.994 --> 13:45.855
THAT'S IT? TWO WORDS?

13:45.856 --> 13:49.328
- YEAH, BUT THEY MEAN A GREAT DEAL.
- THEY MEAN THAT HE'S HUNGRY.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.230
YEAH, HUNGRY FOR LOVE.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.332
...OF FOOD!

13:53.333 --> 13:56.105
- YOU ARE SO WRONG.
- AND BY SO WRONG, YOU MEAN I'M SO RIGHT.

13:56.106 --> 13:58.908
- I'LL SHOW YOU.
- REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SHOW ME?

13:58.909 --> 14:01.510
THAT THIS MEANS SO MUCH MORE THAN
YOUR RIDICULOUS LITTLE CLUB CHAIR.

14:01.511 --> 14:04.313
WILL YOU LEAVE MY CHAIR
OUT OF THIS, PLEASE?

14:04.314 --> 14:06.615
- WE REALLY NEED TO GET INTO WORK NOW.
- GLADLY.

14:06.616 --> 14:09.278
- DINNER!
- JUST A DINNER.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.581
JUST A CHAIR.

14:23.533 --> 14:25.965
OOH, THE PRESS LOVES
SOMEBODY TONIGHT:

14:25.966 --> 14:28.597
"BURKE ELOQUENT AS COUNCIL
APPROVES ARTS BILL."

14:28.598 --> 14:30.239
THERE ARE LIKE 12
STORIES UP ALREADY

14:30.240 --> 14:32.441
AND I'M NOT EVEN COUNTING
THE NAKED BLOGGER GUY.

14:32.442 --> 14:34.603
HEY, DENNIS HAS A FOLLOWING.

14:34.604 --> 14:37.907
YOU ARE VERY POPULAR WITH NAKED
PEOPLE AT THEIR COMPUTERS.

14:37.908 --> 14:40.910
SO WHERE'S THEO
TAKING YOU TONIGHT?

14:40.911 --> 14:43.582
MY NEW FAVORITE SPOT...
NOT HERE.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.455
RYDER, NEED YA! SO THEO
LOOKED PRETTY HAPPY

14:46.456 --> 14:48.057
ABOUT THE VOTES,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:48.058 --> 14:50.559
HE'S GONNA LOOK HAPPIER TONIGHT.
LOOK AT YOU!

14:50.560 --> 14:53.892
WELL, I AM WEARING MY CELEBRATORY
"PUBLIC ARTS FUNDING" BRA.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.896
I WISH THE ARTS GOT
THAT MUCH SUPPORT.

14:58.668 --> 15:00.099
SO WHAT'S UP?

15:00.100 --> 15:04.433
RYDER, THERE ARE ONE TOO
MANY TV'S IN THIS ROOM.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.376
CAN YOU FIND IT?

15:08.038 --> 15:10.079
TAKE IT ON DOWN TO
JOE'S MAN CAVE.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.982
I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BRING IT
BACK UP HERE FOR PLAYOFF GAMES.

15:12.983 --> 15:15.644
- THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION.
- SURE IT IS.

15:15.645 --> 15:19.149
- JOE'S INFLUENCE ON YOU IS NOT APPRECIATED.
- HE SAID YOU'D SAY THAT.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.321
YEAH, I KNOW,

15:22.322 --> 15:25.624
BUT IF MRS. DENTON LETS US DO A VIDEO,
WE WON'T HAVE TO WRITE THE PAPER.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.157
LET'S GET BAILEY IN OUR GROUP.
SHE LOVES TO WORK.

15:28.158 --> 15:31.000
- HI, LENNOX AND?
- VICTORIA.

15:31.001 --> 15:33.162
HI. YOU'RE LIKE FAMOUS
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

15:33.163 --> 15:36.335
YES, SHE IS CITY
COUNCILWOMAN MEL BURKE,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.607
WHO REPRESENTS THE SEVENTH
DISTRICT, INCLUDING...

15:38.608 --> 15:41.140
RHONDA, EASY, NOT A VOTER.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.972
IT'S LIKE CIGARETTES.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.715
YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH BRAND
LOYALTY WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.479
- WE'LL BE UPSTAIRS.
- OH, HEY,

15:50.480 --> 15:53.222
- SHE'S FROM GRANT?
- YEAH YEAH, REALLY FUNNY STORY.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.154
OH WELL, YOUR AUNT
LOVES FUNNY STORIES.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.957
OKAY, SO I WAS IN THE BATHROOM AND
I HEARD THIS GIRL THROWING UP.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.131
- FUNNY ALREADY.
- AND I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW THAT SOUND!"

16:02.132 --> 16:04.693
'CAUSE THAT'S LIKE THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM BACK AT McALISTER.

16:04.694 --> 16:07.436
SO I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE THE SPEECH
I USED TO ALWAYS GIVE THERE:

16:07.437 --> 16:10.169
"YOU'RE PRETTY THE WAY YOU ARE.
THERE'S NO PERFECT BODY TYPE.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.371
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE
A MODEL IN A MAGAZINE."

16:12.372 --> 16:14.503
THEN SHE TURNS AROUND AND
STARTS SHOUTING AT ME,

16:14.504 --> 16:18.107
"I'M NOT BULIMIC, I JUST ATE THE
CAFETERIA CHILI! GO TO HELL!"

16:18.108 --> 16:21.550
- SHE'S GREAT.
- SO YOU MADE A NEW FRIEND?

16:21.551 --> 16:25.655
I DID THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO,
NOT BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO.

16:28.358 --> 16:30.419
SHE DID IT BECAUSE
I TOLD HER TO.

16:30.420 --> 16:34.193
I ASSUME YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE HERE FOR DINNER?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.465
SHE MIGHT MISS BREAKFAST.

16:36.466 --> 16:38.727
I HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME.

16:38.728 --> 16:40.030
PFFFT.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.374
EXCUSE ME, JOSEPH.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.236
UH-OH.

16:47.237 --> 16:49.238
NO, YOU'RE FINE. I JUST...

16:49.239 --> 16:51.740
I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I SAID BEFORE

16:51.741 --> 16:53.642
ABOUT YOU AND
TIFFANY AND THINGS.

16:53.643 --> 16:55.714
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A
TOUGH TRANSITION

16:55.715 --> 16:57.746
AND THERE'S SOME
THINGS YOU MISS,

16:57.747 --> 17:01.250
SO I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT
HELP YOU MOVE ON.

17:01.251 --> 17:02.791
A LAPTOP? THANK YOU.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.754
YOU KNOW, THE FEDS TOOK
MINE FOR EVIDENCE.

17:06.396 --> 17:09.528
NO NO NO, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
LEATHER CLUB CHAIRS TO REPLACE YOURS.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.201
LOOK, THERE'S LIKE A DOZEN OF
THEM SELLING RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.

17:12.202 --> 17:14.803
- THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU, BURKE.
- SEE?

17:14.804 --> 17:17.636
LOOK, LEATHER,
PERFECT CONDITION.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.639
- LOOK AT THIS ONE... IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARACTER.
- THAT'S MY CHAIR.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.612
SEE? JUST LIKE THAT WE
FIND YOU ONE YOU LIKE.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.744
NO NO NO, THAT...
THAT-THAT IS MY CHAIR.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.676
THAT IS... THAT'S
MY ACTUAL CHAIR.

17:27.677 --> 17:29.618
THAT'S MY DAMN CHAIR!

17:29.619 --> 17:31.750
- SHE'S SELLING IT?
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S YOURS.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.622
- THERE'S LIKE A MILLION OF THESE.
- YES I DO!

17:33.623 --> 17:35.354
LOOK AT THIS... ZOOM ZOOM, OKAY.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.586
YOU SEE? THAT IS
TIFFANY RIGHT THERE.

17:37.587 --> 17:40.690
I RECOGNIZE THOSE. YOU KNOW WHY?
I PAID FOR THOSE TOO!

17:45.735 --> 17:47.736
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT ME.

17:47.737 --> 17:50.100
THIS IS ALL ABOUT MONEY.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.846
I'M SORRY, JOE. I HAD NO IDEA.

17:57.847 --> 18:00.709
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.782
I JUST SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS THING COMING.
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.815
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE FEELINGS, IT'S
HARD TO SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

18:06.816 --> 18:09.459
IT'LL BE OKAY.

18:11.761 --> 18:14.523
WHERE'S THE TV?

18:14.524 --> 18:17.166
- DOWNSTAIRS.
- WHATEVER.

18:17.167 --> 18:20.369
IF IT'S COOL WITH YOU, I'M JUST GONNA
CHILL HERE A LITTLE BIT, ALL RIGHT?

18:20.370 --> 18:22.231
OOOH, HERE'S THE THING.

18:22.232 --> 18:24.633
UM, THEO'S COMING OVER AND
GIVEN THAT HE'S COMING OVER,

18:24.634 --> 18:27.576
PERHAPS A BETTER PLACE FOR YOU
TO CHILL MIGHT BE DOWNSTAIRS?

18:27.577 --> 18:30.209
IT WAS THE BEST CHAIR
I'M EVER GONNA HAVE.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.111
I'VE SAT IN SOME CHAIRS, BURKE.

18:33.112 --> 18:37.146
UM, YOU KNOW, WHEN THINGS
ARE SWIRLING AROUND ME

18:37.147 --> 18:38.817
AND I REALLY NEED
TO CLEAR MY HEAD,

18:38.818 --> 18:41.390
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER
THAN GOING TO MY OWN ROOM.

18:41.391 --> 18:43.192
OH, ROOM SWEET ROOM.

18:43.193 --> 18:45.724
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.297
- IT'S FINALLY OVER.
- ( beeps )

18:48.298 --> 18:50.759
OOH, ANOTHER TEXT FROM THEO.

18:50.760 --> 18:55.704
"CAN'T MAKE DINNER TONIGHT. MY BOYFRIEND
AND I ARE TAKING OUR CAT TO THE HOSPITAL.

18:55.705 --> 18:59.669
ELPHEBA IS COUGHING UP BLOOD.
THANKS FOR THE VOTES."

19:01.711 --> 19:04.673
BOYFRIEND? WHAT THE
HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

19:04.674 --> 19:07.447
THAT HE'S GAY.

19:08.878 --> 19:11.651
- GAY?
- YEAH, YOU KNOW... HE LIKES GUYS.

19:12.922 --> 19:16.285
AND CATS.

19:16.286 --> 19:18.728
PROBABLY THE MUSICAL "CATS."

19:20.560 --> 19:22.931
BUT HE LIKED FOOTBALL
AND HE FLIRTED!

19:22.932 --> 19:26.296
OOOH, HE INTENTIONALLY
JAMMED MY GAYDAR!

19:28.838 --> 19:31.340
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?
I DATED A LESBIAN ONCE.

19:31.341 --> 19:34.273
SHE WAS ACTUALLY A NICE GIRL.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.775
YOU'RE JUST NOT THE BEST AT
JUDGING SIGNALS. SO WHAT?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.408
HE WAS USING ME. AND IT WAS
ALL COMPLETELY POLITICAL.

19:39.409 --> 19:42.781
AND NOW HE'S DONE PRETENDING AND HE'S BACK
WITH HIS BOYFRIEND AND THEIR DYING CAT!

19:42.782 --> 19:44.753
OH, I HOPE THEY'RE HAPPY!

19:44.754 --> 19:47.416
YOU'RE JUST ITCHING TO SAY
I TOLD YOU SO, AREN'T YOU?

19:47.417 --> 19:49.818
HEY, I JUST GOT
DUMPED FOR A CHAIR.

19:49.819 --> 19:53.422
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT HIS
PUBLIC ARTS FUNDING SCHEME.

19:53.423 --> 19:56.565
WELL, THAT'S IT! FROM NOW ON, I'M
ONLY SUPPORTING TECHNICAL SCHOOLS!

19:56.566 --> 19:58.897
THE ARTS CAN BITE ME!

19:58.898 --> 20:02.701
HEY, RYDER, RYDER, GET BACK DOWNSTAIRS
AND GET THAT TV BACK UP HERE.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.434
I WANT 52" OF PLASMA IN
FRONT OF MY FACE PRONTO.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.736
- BUT I JUST TOOK IT...
- OH HEY!

20:07.737 --> 20:11.780
LOOK LOOK, WHEN THEY FINALLY AGREE WITH YOU ON
SOMETHING, YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND GO WITH IT.

20:11.781 --> 20:13.883
- I'M GONNA LEARN A LOT FROM YOU, AREN'T I?
- DAMN STRAIGHT, BOY.

20:22.692 --> 20:24.894
GO GO GO GO GO...

20:26.596 --> 20:29.328
- YES!
- WHOO!

20:29.329 --> 20:32.801
AND THE BABY PENGUIN IS HATCHED!

20:32.802 --> 20:35.834
THAT IS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.507
SO CAN WE KEEP THE TV?

20:38.508 --> 20:40.539
IT'LL HELP ME MAKE MORE FRIENDS.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.811
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK I
