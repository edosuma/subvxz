{\an5}(Kelly's voice): Hi, this is
Kelly. I'm not in right now.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.046
Please leave a message.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.053
{\an5}Hi, this is Kelly.
I'm not in right now.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.122
Please leave a message.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.191
{\an1}We're not having
too much luck, are we?

00:25.258 --> 00:26.025
It wasn't that bad.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.427
{\an1}Oh, come on,
I spent more time looking

00:27.494 --> 00:29.129
{\an1}at my watch
than I did the screen.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.397
{\an1}If I pick one more
crummy movie,

00:30.463 --> 00:31.798
you'll probably never
go out with me again.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.400
{\an3}No, you get one
more chance,

00:33.466 --> 00:35.168
but the pressure's on.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.170
{\an1}Well, I had
a good time anyway.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.705
{\an3}Me, too.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.179
Oh... sorry.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.614
I... I thought
I heard noises.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.748
{\an3}I just wanted
to check.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.216
No, no problem.

00:50.283 --> 00:51.117
{\an3}Greg was just
saying good night.

00:51.184 --> 00:52.252
Hi, Tara, how are you?

00:52.318 --> 00:53.420
Great.

00:53.486 --> 00:55.188
It's good to see you.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.292
Well, good night.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.194
{\an1}So, how are things
going with her?

01:01.261 --> 01:03.229
Um, good, fine.

01:03.296 --> 01:04.831
{\an3}My roommates aren't
very thrilled,

01:04.897 --> 01:06.699
{\an3}but she's not
staying forever.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.568
{\an1}I got to hand it to you,
you're a very generous woman.

01:08.635 --> 01:09.769
I mean, most people
wouldn't reach out

01:09.836 --> 01:11.337
to a stranger like that.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.339
{\an3}Oh, she's not a
stranger, not anymore.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.341
{\an3}We're getting to know
each other pretty well.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.409
{\an1}Good.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.546
Well, I, uh, better be going.

01:19.612 --> 01:20.647
I got an early morning.

01:20.713 --> 01:21.848
{\an3}Okay.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.249
{\an3}Good night.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.249
Good night.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.624
Hi, this is Kelly.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.159
I'm not in right now.

Okay, let's go.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.523
{\an8}Spring break,
here we come.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.273
{\an8}(indistinct conversation)

03:41.821 --> 03:43.556
{\an8}Uh, how much longer
before we get there?

03:43.623 --> 03:45.291
Joe, I told you to go
to the bathroom

03:45.358 --> 03:46.859
before we left the house.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.294
It says we're hitting
the height

03:48.361 --> 03:49.629
of the wildflower season.

03:49.696 --> 03:50.930
No wonder my allergies
are acting up.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.832
{\an3}Oh, a fruit stand,
I want strawberries.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.866
Oh, I'm gonna
get oranges.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.902
Do you want anything?

03:53.933 --> 03:55.902
{\an1}No.

03:57.003 --> 03:57.937
CLARE:
What are you looking at?

03:58.004 --> 04:00.340
Never seen a
girl before?

04:00.406 --> 04:01.608
What are you
staring at?

04:01.674 --> 04:02.675
Nothing.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.744
CLARE:
Go help them.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.846
{\an1}Nah... they
won't appreciate it.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.381
They're probably
women's libbers.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.616
{\an3}Mmm.

04:09.682 --> 04:10.950
Well, they may be,

04:11.017 --> 04:12.852
but you ought
to give it a try.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.253
{\an1}Okay.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.689
Yeah, I better
go, too.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.591
{\an4}What...

04:16.755 --> 04:18.591
Um, flat tires
are my specialty.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.392
Yeah, right.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.996
Is this a road fantasy
or what?

04:23.062 --> 04:24.631
{\an3}God, what are the chances
of this happening

04:24.697 --> 04:26.466
if we were on the
road alone, huh?

04:26.532 --> 04:27.867
{\an5}Nil.

04:26.532 --> 04:27.867
{\an3}Yeah, that's
what I thought.

04:27.934 --> 04:28.868
You're choking me.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.902
Hello, ladies.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.037
{\an5}Hi.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.037
You need a hand?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.038
{\an3}Do we ever.

04:32.105 --> 04:32.939
Well, say no more.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.941
We'll have you
on the road in a jiffy.

04:35.008 --> 04:35.942
{\an3}Thanks.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.644
You have no idea
how many people

04:37.710 --> 04:39.846
{\an4}just walked by
and didn't even offer.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.846
{\an3}Really?

04:39.912 --> 04:41.714
It's nice to meet some gentlemen
in this country.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.949
{\an3}Thanks, where are
you guys from?

04:43.016 --> 04:43.950
{\an1}Canada.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.318
A small town
in Ontario.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.653
{\an3}I'm sure you've
never heard of it.

04:46.719 --> 04:47.654
Parry Sound?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.888
Parry Sound.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.790
{\an1}Home of hall of fame
hockey player, Bobby Orr.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.592
Wow, a hockey fan.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.027
No, just a puck head.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.495
That's so cool.

04:55.561 --> 04:56.896
Where are you guys from?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.665
L.A. I'm Joe.

04:58.731 --> 04:59.799
{\an1}Hi.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.734
{\an5}I'm Brandon, hi.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.734
Hi.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.002
I'm Steve,
and you guys are?

05:03.069 --> 05:04.904
I'm Becky, and this
is Alice and Margaret.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.072
Hi.

05:06.139 --> 05:06.739
It looks
like they're having

05:06.806 --> 05:08.441
a little bit
too much fun.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.943
{\an3}Yeah, well, see,
that would be

05:11.010 --> 05:12.612
{\an1}your idea.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.080
Oh, come on, don't tell
me you guys are worried.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.848
No, not very.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.384
It just reminds me of an
old theory I have about men.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.585
What would that be?

05:19.652 --> 05:22.422
They're, uh, pigs.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.990
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.990
{\an3}Oh, right.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.892
Yeah.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.560
So, uh, are you guys
on vacation?

05:27.627 --> 05:28.561
Yeah, spring break.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.562
How about you guys?

05:29.629 --> 05:30.663
We want to camp out.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.498
You know, hike,
see the wildflowers.

05:32.565 --> 05:33.933
{\an1}Do you know
any good spots?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.002
Well, yeah, we're gonna go
camp up at Lake Isabella.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.670
With our dates.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.572
{\an1}Oh.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.572
{\an3}Oh.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.674
Is it nice there?

05:41.741 --> 05:43.776
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's gorgeous.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.011
(chuckling)

05:45.078 --> 05:46.713
Well, there you go,
you're on your way.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.014
We appreciate it.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.014
{\an1}Yeah.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.415
Sure, any time.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.983
{\an6}Have a nice
trip, ladies.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.983
{\an1}You bet.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.552
{\an6}Thanks.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.552
{\an1}Thanks.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.552
Thanks again.

05:52.618 --> 05:53.886
{\an1}Bye.

05:52.618 --> 05:53.886
See you.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.088
{\an1}Bye.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.823
"With our dates"?

05:56.889 --> 05:58.091
What? You're so smooth.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.525
{\an1}Steve, Steve,
what's he supposed to say,

05:59.592 --> 06:01.360
"We'll ditch our dates,
we'll meet you there"?

06:01.427 --> 06:03.629
A guy can't fantasize?

06:03.696 --> 06:04.964
(knocking)

06:05.031 --> 06:06.833
VALERIE:
<i>Uh, coming.</i>

06:09.035 --> 06:11.871
(knocking)

06:14.207 --> 06:15.408
Can I help you?

06:15.475 --> 06:16.909
MAN:
Yeah, open the door.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.012
What... what do you want?

06:20.079 --> 06:22.548
Look, does Colin Robbins
live here or not?

06:22.615 --> 06:24.016
Who's asking?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.952
Graham Robbins.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.688
Are you related
to him or something?

06:28.755 --> 06:29.856
Yeah, I'm his father.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.057
Now open the door.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.931
(dog whining)

06:40.867 --> 06:43.069
Well, I told you who I am.
Who are you?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.537
Uh, Valerie.

06:44.604 --> 06:45.972
I'm a friend of Colin's.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.073
Is my son around?

06:47.140 --> 06:49.108
Actually, he's gonna
be out for a while.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.843
He's, uh, picking up
some art supplies

06:50.910 --> 06:51.944
and running a bunch
of errands.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.847
Would... would you
like to sit down?

06:54.914 --> 06:55.982
Sure.

06:56.048 --> 06:57.483
The couch is to the right.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.551
I'll find it.

06:58.618 --> 07:02.121
Heidi... chair, right.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.729
Okay, so a yogurt
for you, Kel,

07:09.796 --> 07:10.963
and what would you
like, Tara?

07:11.030 --> 07:12.965
Chopped salad, please.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.567
Okay, done.

07:14.634 --> 07:15.735
What are you gonna do
during the break?

07:15.802 --> 07:18.838
Oh, just hang out,
catch up on some school.

07:18.905 --> 07:19.939
That's good.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.609
So, what are you and Greg
gonna do tonight?

07:23.676 --> 07:24.811
Bowling.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.113
Bowling, sounds like fun.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.648
Why don't you come with us?

07:28.714 --> 07:29.682
{\an3}No.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.017
I hate being a third wheel.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.819
Greg doesn't mind.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.120
No.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.521
I'll just stay home
and watch TV.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.190
(sighs) Fine.

07:37.256 --> 07:38.191
Is the bathroom...

07:38.257 --> 07:39.725
{\an3}Mmm.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.094
I'll be right back.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.896
{\an3}Hi, David.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.896
Hey.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.033
{\an6}Hey, you mind
if I sit?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.033
{\an1}Hello.

07:47.099 --> 07:49.535
{\an1}No.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.004
What are you doing tonight?

07:52.071 --> 07:53.673
Nothing.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.875
You want to go bowling?

07:55.942 --> 07:56.976
Yeah, sure.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.144
One condition.

07:58.211 --> 07:58.978
What's that?

07:59.045 --> 08:00.046
When Tara gets back,

08:00.112 --> 08:02.014
you ask her to go as your date.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.083
(chuckling)

08:04.150 --> 08:05.051
Not a chance.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.686
{\an1}Please.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.888
Greg and I are going,
and I just feel guilty.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.756
I've been leaving her
at home every night,

08:10.823 --> 08:13.492
and I want her
to have a good time.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.928
What if she doesn't even want
to go with me?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.164
Just ask her.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.199
{\an1}Okay?

08:23.035 --> 08:24.203
How's it going, David?

08:24.270 --> 08:25.671
Uh, it's...

08:25.738 --> 08:26.806
{\an3}it's going.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.709
{\an1}Uh, you want
to go bowling?

08:31.077 --> 08:32.211
This is a setup.

08:34.981 --> 08:35.982
{\an1}(sighs)

08:36.048 --> 08:38.049
Yeah, that it is.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.818
So what do you say?

08:39.885 --> 08:41.621
{\an3}Okay.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.757
Okay, we'll leave the apartment
at 8:00.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.125
{\an3}(laughing)

08:46.192 --> 08:49.195
(murmuring)

09:00.206 --> 09:02.074
This is it, number 48.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.309
It's all ours.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.877
Beautiful.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.846
{\an3}This is Mother Nature
at her finest, huh?

09:06.913 --> 09:08.080
I've got to say,
we lucked out.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.982
We got one
great location.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.217
Yeah, and we only
have one neighbor

09:11.284 --> 09:13.152
{\an3}over there on
that side.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.725
{\an3}DONNA:
Hey, guys, uh,

09:19.792 --> 09:20.726
don't go too far.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.662
We have a lot of
unpacking to do.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.267
{\an1}(sighs)

09:28.334 --> 09:31.704
Truly, this
is the promised land.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.139
Oh, Canada.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.107
{\an1}Should we go
over there and see

09:35.174 --> 09:36.909
{\an1}if they want us
to help them again?

09:36.976 --> 09:38.778
What would our dates say?

09:38.844 --> 09:41.047
{\an1}Hey, what
are they doing?

09:41.113 --> 09:43.149
{\an1}Somehow, I don't think
they're examining

09:43.215 --> 09:44.984
{\an1}the rare
indigenous flora.

09:46.018 --> 09:47.586
Really?

09:47.653 --> 09:48.854
{\an5}Hi.

09:47.653 --> 09:48.854
{\an3}STEVE:
Hi.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.822
Hey, we're neighbors.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.991
You guys were right,
this place is gorgeous.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.092
{\an3}Hey.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.594
{\an3}CLARE:
Aren't those, um,

09:55.661 --> 09:57.863
{\an1}the same girls that had
the, uh, car trouble?

09:57.930 --> 09:58.864
Yeah.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.166
Oh.

10:00.232 --> 10:01.033
{\an1}What are they
doing here?

10:01.100 --> 10:02.868
{\an3}They were looking
for a place to camp,

10:02.935 --> 10:04.036
{\an3}so we told them
about this place.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.705
{\an3}Why?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.073
Just being friendly.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.174
Yeah, come on,
we'll introduce you.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.617
{\an1}Hey.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.617
Hi.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.019
{\an4}Hi.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.019
{\an1}Hi.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.020
Hi, guys.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.088
{\an4}Hi.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.088
{\an3}Hi.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.088
{\an1}Hi.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.323
{\an1}I'm Alice, this
is Margaret and Becky.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.825
{\an3}I'm Clare.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.760
{\an4}This is Donna
and Susan.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.760
{\an1}Hi.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.862
{\an5}Oh, you girls
have some great guys.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.862
Yeah, you know,

10:29.929 --> 10:31.664
{\an3}we're kind of ashamed to
admit it, but we never

10:31.731 --> 10:32.932
{\an3}could have changed that
flat without them.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.002
{\an1}Yeah, well, we were glad
to loan them to you.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.104
{\an3}But now we need them
back, so, uh...

10:38.170 --> 10:40.106
{\an3}we actually better
get back and set up.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.407
{\an5}It'll be dark soon.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.407
Yeah, right.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.075
{\an5}Enjoy yourselves, guys.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.075
Yeah, you, too.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.745
(all say good-bye)

10:46.779 --> 10:48.247
{\an3}Okay, um...

10:48.314 --> 10:49.849
Put this one...

10:49.915 --> 10:51.183
{\an3}Ah, stay.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.385
{\an3}(shrieks)

10:54.186 --> 10:57.690
Uh... don't worry
about it.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.291
We've done this a billion times.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.426
(embarrassed laughter)

11:00.493 --> 11:02.094
{\an3}Okay, bye.
Come on.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.271
Do you want some more lasagna?

11:12.338 --> 11:15.841
Oh... I don't mind if I do.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.944
You know, I don't know
what's keeping Colin.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.049
So, uh...

11:23.115 --> 11:25.117
how do you like L.A.?

11:25.184 --> 11:28.087
Don't feel like
you have to make conversation.

11:30.322 --> 11:32.258
You know, I have to say,

11:32.324 --> 11:35.094
{\an1}Colin hasn't mentioned you
to me before.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.962
I'm not surprised.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.198
When I came back from Vietnam
without my peepers,

11:39.265 --> 11:41.367
I wasn't much good to anyone.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.005
{\an3}His mother
remarried.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.074
I'm sorry.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.379
How long do you plan on staying?

11:53.446 --> 11:54.880
Why? You anxious
to get rid of me?

11:54.947 --> 11:56.115
No.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.115
{\an3}Good.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.017
'Cause I haven't seen my son
in five years.

11:58.084 --> 12:01.153
Where are you staying?

12:01.220 --> 12:02.822
Uh, Veteran's Administration.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.892
Heard that Colin's doing
pretty well out here.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.262
Making a name
for himself.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.064
Yes.

12:12.131 --> 12:14.133
He's, uh...
He's very, very talented.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.334
{\an3}And it's a
good thing.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.269
'Cause it's the only thing
that keeps him out of trouble.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.437
(laughs)

12:18.504 --> 12:20.940
You his girlfriend?

12:21.006 --> 12:23.876
You live here?

12:23.943 --> 12:27.046
Hey, Val. Sorry
I took so long.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.049
Smells good.

12:33.219 --> 12:36.422
Oh, my God.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.090
I've been called worse.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.191
Sit down, son.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.160
{\an3}Have something
to eat.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.162
{\an3}Your girlfriend here,
or whoever she is,

12:43.229 --> 12:46.098
isn't a bad cook.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.033
You don't call.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.768
You don't write.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.203
You just show up.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.171
Yeah, that's about
the size of it.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.239
Why, you want me to leave?

12:57.076 --> 12:59.111
No.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.448
No.

13:02.515 --> 13:06.185
It's absolutely
beautiful out here.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.920
Gets no better.

13:07.987 --> 13:08.988
You know,
tomorrow,

13:09.054 --> 13:11.123
{\an3}I think we should take a
big hike before breakfast.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.291
I'd be into that.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.126
{\an1}Damn it, Becky,
I thought you fixed it.

13:14.193 --> 13:14.927
I thought I did.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.529
{\an3}Then why does it
keep falling down?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.330
{\an1}What? What? Is this
gonna go on all night?

13:18.397 --> 13:20.032
Well, just ignore them.
Where is Steve?

13:20.099 --> 13:21.367
He was supposed
to get more firewood.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.835
He's over there.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.336
{\an3}Still having trouble
with that, huh?

13:24.403 --> 13:26.172
Oh, yes.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.172
{\an3}Well...

13:26.238 --> 13:27.439
(scoffs)

13:27.506 --> 13:30.209
Steve Sanders,
the good Samaritan.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.278
Hey, Joe, uh,

13:32.344 --> 13:33.979
{\an3}think we should go over
there and help 'em set up?

13:34.046 --> 13:35.214
Yeah, we probably should.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.450
{\an1}Go ahead. You know
you want to.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.452
{\an3}I'm going.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.921
{\an1}I'll be
right back.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.355
Okay.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.355
Fine.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.126
{\an1}You guys,

13:47.193 --> 13:49.195
{\an1}do you think
it was a good idea

13:49.261 --> 13:51.130
{\an1}letting them
go over there alone?

13:51.197 --> 13:52.364
Oh, well, I mean,
they'll be back.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.033
Or they'll be dead.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.201
Yeah.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.903
Yeah, right.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.306
TARA:
<i>What do you think?</i>

14:00.372 --> 14:01.473
{\an3}Very nice.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.841
{\an1}(sighs)

14:02.908 --> 14:05.211
{\an1}You didn't have
to set me up with David.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.613
{\an1}I know he doesn't want
to go out with me.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.081
Of course he does.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.350
{\an3}He wouldn't be going
if he didn't like you.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.885
Maybe.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.054
I'm just nervous.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.424
I haven't been on a real date
in such a long time.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.259
You'll be fine. Relax.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.561
{\an3}TARA:
Okay.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.598
So how do you know when to sleep
with a guy, anyway?

14:25.664 --> 14:27.533
What?

14:27.600 --> 14:31.237
I just... I know I always do it
too soon or too late.

14:31.303 --> 14:34.073
I mean, how many dates
should you go on anyway?

14:34.139 --> 14:36.375
I don't know.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.311
With me, it's...

14:39.378 --> 14:42.114
until I feel like
I can't wait anymore.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.483
What about you and Greg?

14:44.550 --> 14:47.920
I can't wait anymore.

14:47.987 --> 14:48.654
(laughs)

14:47.987 --> 14:48.654
Are you done

14:48.721 --> 14:50.322
with the bathroom?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.322
{\an3}Yeah.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.595
(door closing)

14:56.662 --> 14:59.498
I'm Kelly Taylor, and Greg,

14:59.565 --> 15:02.167
I can't wait anymore.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.354
{\an3}This is your advice--
aim for the gutter?

15:22.421 --> 15:24.223
{\an1}Well, you've been aiming
for the middle,

15:24.290 --> 15:26.992
{\an1}and you've been, uh,
getting the gutter every time,

15:27.059 --> 15:29.161
{\an1}so, you know, this might
straighten you out.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.230
I have a better idea.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.107
That's unbelievable.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.242
{\an1}(laughs)

15:43.309 --> 15:45.678
You have incredible hands.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.379
You should be a surgeon.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.348
{\an6}Well, it does
run in the family.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.348
{\an1}(laughs)

15:49.415 --> 15:51.283
{\an1}Did you always
want to do that?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.619
{\an3}No. Actually, I wanted
to be a lion tamer,

15:53.686 --> 15:55.154
{\an3}except I'm
allergic to cats.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.155
{\an1}(laughs)

15:56.221 --> 15:57.489
{\an3}Next game,
I'm with Greg.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.425
Oh, so you're dropping me?

15:59.491 --> 16:00.726
Like a rock.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.494
(laughs)

16:02.561 --> 16:04.163
What do you say?

16:04.229 --> 16:07.533
{\an1}I think our family honor
is at stake.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.102
You two are finished.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.737
{\an3}So, how's it
going, partner?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.006
Good.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.178
Is that better?

16:19.244 --> 16:20.679
{\an5}STEVE:
Yeah, that's
much better.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.981
All right, Joe, I think
you got to stick that pole

16:23.048 --> 16:24.149
into this pocket.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.517
{\an1}No, I've tried it
a ton of times.

16:25.584 --> 16:26.719
I think it's the wrong pole.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.387
No, it's actually
the wrong pocket.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.222
Ladies, I hate
to tell you this,

16:30.289 --> 16:32.591
but it doesn't look
like the tent's going up.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.026
{\an1}Any chance
you guys

16:34.093 --> 16:35.427
could be missing
a few poles?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.762
I guess so, yeah.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.597
{\an3}Well, we had them
all last time.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.733
{\an5}What are we going to do?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.733
{\an1}STEVE:
Don't worry.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.101
{\an3}We'll figure
something out.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.235
(sighs)

16:46.271 --> 16:48.207
Who likes them burnt?

16:48.273 --> 16:50.476
I do. Fits my mood.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.511
I'm kidding.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.346
What the hell's
taking them so long?

16:54.413 --> 16:56.715
{\an1}Well, we could go over
and check it out.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.617
You're kidding, right?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.754
If we go there, they're totally
gonna think we're jealous.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.222
{\an3}We're not
going there.

17:03.288 --> 17:04.490
We're staying here.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.195
Do you think the girls
are all that pretty?

17:11.262 --> 17:14.098
No, don't think so.

17:14.165 --> 17:17.102
But I guess it doesn't matter
what we think, right?

17:18.670 --> 17:22.273
{\an1}Well, I'm gonna
go see for myself.

17:23.409 --> 17:24.643
{\an1}See ya.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.216
(distant, indistinct chatter)

17:37.656 --> 17:39.691
{\an6}CLARE:
Hey, what's
the problem?

17:39.758 --> 17:40.826
Trouble with the tent?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.094
{\an3}Yeah, we can't
get it up.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.695
{\an3}I'll bet.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.695
{\an1}(snickers)

17:43.762 --> 17:46.165
Ladies, I'm afraid
you're tentless.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.232
{\an1}We tried.

17:47.299 --> 17:48.400
That's all right.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.835
{\an1}You know, we'll figure
something out.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.203
It's not
your problem.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.171
{\an1}Uh-uh.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.171
No big deal.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.639
{\an3}Yeah, thanks for
trying, guys.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.208
Well, it was our humble
pleasure trying to help.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.143
{\an1}BECKY:
You girls probably

17:58.210 --> 17:59.578
want your guys back, huh?

17:59.645 --> 18:01.180
Uh...

18:01.246 --> 18:02.614
{\an1}Uh, actually, no,
um, we don't,

18:02.681 --> 18:04.450
but, um, we'd be
willing to help.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.251
{\an3}Hey, that's great,
Clare, thanks.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.287
{\an1}I have an extra space
in my tent.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.355
{\an1}You guys are more
than welcome to crash.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.491
{\an6}SUSAN:
Absolutely.
What do you say?

18:12.558 --> 18:13.792
Sure. You know what?

18:13.859 --> 18:15.627
In fact,
a space just opened up.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.196
{\an1}Great.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.030
{\an3}It's settled
then.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.265
{\an3}You can stay in
our camp tonight.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.301
{\an5}Really?

18:20.332 --> 18:22.301
{\an1}That'd be
great.

18:22.367 --> 18:23.802
{\an6}ALICE:
Yeah. I wasn't exactly
looking forward

18:23.869 --> 18:25.504
{\an3}to bunking out with
the insects, you know?

18:25.571 --> 18:26.839
(laughter)

18:26.905 --> 18:28.106
Come on.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.274
Right this way.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.809
{\an3}Yes.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.711
Clare?

18:30.876 --> 18:32.711
{\an3}What?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.213
Those are two-man tents.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.814
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.449
{\an1}Where are we going
to sleep?

18:37.516 --> 18:40.152
{\an3}Well, it'll be
your humble pleasure

18:40.219 --> 18:42.788
{\an3}to sleep outside with
the rest of the snakes.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.223
{\an3}Good night.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.861
Oh, great.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.863
They're serious.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.631
{\an1}Maybe we should
go apologize.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.200
Why? We didn't
do anything.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.469
{\an3}We just got
totally hosed, eh?

18:59.238 --> 19:01.306
(bowling pins clattering)

19:04.910 --> 19:06.745
Well, so much
for family honor.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.180
Hey.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.180
{\an3}Hey.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.215
It's not whether
you win or lose,

19:10.282 --> 19:11.583
{\an3}but how you
play the game.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.751
Oh, really?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.319
{\an6}And you guys
played terribly.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.319
Oh.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.655
{\an1}Yeah, well, next time,
I'm gonna have Kelly play

19:16.722 --> 19:18.223
with her eyes
closed, I think.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.525
{\an1}Did I mention
loser pays?

19:19.591 --> 19:21.293
I think
about a dozen times.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.261
{\an3}(laughing)

19:22.327 --> 19:23.795
So, you think
they hate us?

19:23.862 --> 19:25.163
I hope so.

19:25.230 --> 19:25.931
It means they care.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.299
I know Kelly does.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.401
{\an1}She's told me
how much she likes you.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.236
{\an6}She has?

19:29.468 --> 19:31.236
{\an1}Just about
a million times.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.604
Whatever you prescribed

19:32.671 --> 19:33.906
{\an3}for her, doctor,
it worked.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.274
She's hooked.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.642
And David isn't?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.642
Oh, come on.

19:36.708 --> 19:37.809
{\an3}He's just
being polite.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.511
{\an3}Besides, I don't
want to encourage him.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.213
Well, why not?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.915
He's a terrific guy,

19:42.981 --> 19:45.217
but I'm just not ready
to get involved.

19:45.284 --> 19:46.518
Not yet. Not after rehab.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.686
It's too freaky.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.254
After all you've been through,

19:49.321 --> 19:50.222
knowing your limits
is very important.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.924
I couldn't agree with you more.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.926
I think
I know my limits pretty well.

19:53.992 --> 19:56.595
It's, um...
It's Kelly I'm worried about.

19:56.662 --> 19:57.796
How do you mean?

19:57.863 --> 19:59.331
She'd kill me for
telling you this,

19:59.398 --> 20:01.366
but I really think
she's on edge.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.402
I mean,

20:03.468 --> 20:06.271
I don't think she could handle
taking anything else on.

20:06.338 --> 20:07.806
Or anyone.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.974
{\an3}She told me
getting involved

20:09.041 --> 20:10.275
with you was too
much for her now.

20:10.342 --> 20:11.443
She's afraid.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.712
How would she manage
to stay clean?

20:13.779 --> 20:15.514
{\an3}KELLY:
All right.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.282
Double or nothing,
Student Union. Darts.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.417
Darts.

20:18.483 --> 20:19.885
Listen, uh,

20:19.952 --> 20:20.986
it's getting a little late.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.287
I should take you home.

20:22.354 --> 20:23.822
{\an1}(laughing):
Oh, not a chance.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.258
{\an3}No. Not until
revenge is ours.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.226
{\an1}I got early rounds
in the morning.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.728
{\an1}I'm sorry.
Do you guys mind?

20:34.032 --> 20:35.233
(laughs)

20:35.300 --> 20:37.402
Oh, man, what got into him?

20:37.469 --> 20:40.238
I have no idea.

20:40.305 --> 20:43.241
VALERIE:
<i>So, tell me, Mr. Robbins,</i>

20:43.308 --> 20:45.377
how did you lose your sight?

20:45.444 --> 20:50.015
{\an1}Yeah, well, that lucky day,
I got to carry the radio gear.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.785
I was facedown in a foxhole
trying to order air cover,

20:53.852 --> 20:56.622
{\an1}but I couldn't get
a clear channel because some...

20:58.657 --> 21:00.692
...damn general was busy

21:00.759 --> 21:03.261
coordinating
an officers' barbecue.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.998
I'll never forget it.

21:06.064 --> 21:09.034
{\an1}Right before
that stinking shell hit,

21:09.101 --> 21:11.637
I heard him asking
for more rotisserie.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.008
And let me tell you,
there was no Forest Gump around

21:16.074 --> 21:18.010
to drag my blind butt
out of there.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.378
All right,
that's enough.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.013
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

21:21.079 --> 21:22.848
{\an1}Since when do you tell me
what to do?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.683
{\an1}See, you're still
not even good enough

21:24.750 --> 21:26.018
to clean my paint brushes.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.653
You listen to
me, all right?

21:27.719 --> 21:28.987
You're in my house.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.389
I don't have to listen

21:30.455 --> 21:31.823
{\an3}to your war stories,
and I don't have

21:31.890 --> 21:33.291
{\an3}to be put down,
you hear me?

21:33.358 --> 21:35.293
Do you hear me?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.662
{\an3}Now I think it's
time for you to go.

21:37.863 --> 21:38.964
Okay, okay, okay.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.298
{\an3}All right,
that's enough...

21:40.365 --> 21:41.566
Why don't you, uh...

21:41.633 --> 21:43.935
Why don't you sit down
right here, okay?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.874
Yeah.

21:50.075 --> 21:51.076
(whispers):
Colin?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.644
{\an3}(whispers):
What?

21:52.711 --> 21:54.746
He's had a little too much
to drink.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.481
He shouldn't be going out
anywhere.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.617
Just let him stay here.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.352
I'll go home.

22:00.419 --> 22:01.987
That's right.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.522
I shouldn't be going anywhere.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.626
Let me stay here.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.831
{\an3}Come on, Mr. Robbins,
let's, uh,

22:12.898 --> 22:14.433
let's get you
to bed, okay?

22:14.499 --> 22:17.903
Hey, you got
a good woman here, son.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.639
{\an1}I'm sure you'll
screw it up.

22:28.146 --> 22:29.081
{\an1}(laughs)

22:29.147 --> 22:30.549
I'm going to put
some coffee on.

22:30.615 --> 22:34.119
{\an1}I'm gonna get going.
I'll see you guys later.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.988
I'll see you guys inside.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.090
Well...

22:38.156 --> 22:39.558
Good night.

22:39.624 --> 22:40.959
Yeah.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.895
Listen, I know Kelly kind
of roped us into this,

22:43.962 --> 22:45.564
but I had fun.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.432
Yeah, me too.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.801
Only, I just want to be friends,

22:49.868 --> 22:50.969
if that's okay with you.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.938
Yeah, it's no problem.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.473
I didn't think you'd mind.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.408
I mean, I'm sure
I'm not your type.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.578
Good night, David.

22:59.644 --> 23:01.880
Good night.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.923
{\an1}You sure you don't have time
for a walk on the beach?

23:11.990 --> 23:12.991
{\an3}Like I said,
I have early rounds.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.695
Okay, just checking.

23:19.931 --> 23:22.100
Look, Kelly,
maybe we're taking this

23:22.167 --> 23:24.603
all a little too fast.

23:24.669 --> 23:26.772
{\an3}What are you
talking about?

23:26.838 --> 23:29.674
{\an3}I thought it was
just getting good.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.144
It's just, I don't know,

23:32.210 --> 23:33.812
maybe we should just cool off
a little bit

23:33.879 --> 23:36.715
{\an1}until you get back
on your feet.

23:38.049 --> 23:41.086
So that's your
prescription?

23:41.153 --> 23:43.789
{\an3}Take a month off,
call you in the morning?

23:43.855 --> 23:45.857
Something like that.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.092
But I want to see you.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.693
I want to see you too.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.595
Considering what you've been
through,

23:50.662 --> 23:53.532
maybe it's just best if we don't
rush right into this.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.102
{\an3}Maybe you should have
thought of that

23:57.169 --> 23:58.870
{\an3}before you ever
asked me out.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.206
I probably should have.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.508
{\an1}I'm sorry.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.682
{\an3}Look, don't.
All right? Just go.

24:14.152 --> 24:16.154
Whatever you say.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.067
(quietly):
Yes.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.090
(horn honks)

25:09.341 --> 25:10.208
{\an3}Morning.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.643
Morning.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.944
{\an3}We're making
a really good breakfast.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.212
That's nice.

25:20.051 --> 25:21.119
Get up, guys.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.754
{\an1}Get up.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.656
{\an1}(shouts):
Get up!

25:26.258 --> 25:27.559
Battle stations.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.795
Something smells good.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.530
Don't fall for it.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.132
It's a trap.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.867
{\an3}In case you
haven't noticed,

25:35.934 --> 25:37.235
{\an3}we've been
sleeping in a van,

25:37.302 --> 25:39.938
down by the river.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.140
This is war.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.845
Morning.

25:46.912 --> 25:48.113
Morning.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.015
Hope it wasn't too uncomfortable
in there.

25:50.081 --> 25:52.150
{\an1}No, no.
It was just fine.

25:52.217 --> 25:52.951
Isn't that right, Joe?

25:53.018 --> 25:55.587
Yeah. No problems.
Slept like a baby.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.889
{\an3}Well, the girls
really appreciated

25:57.956 --> 25:59.758
{\an3}you guys giving up
your tents for them.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.192
I'm sure they did.

26:01.259 --> 26:03.762
{\an3}Well, actually,
the girls were very nice.

26:03.828 --> 26:04.829
We know that.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.098
{\an1}So, where are they,
anyway?

26:07.165 --> 26:08.300
Well, we all got up
early this morning.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.634
{\an3}They went
for a hike.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.036
{\an3}DONNA:
Hey, Joe,

26:11.102 --> 26:12.237
{\an3}how about a nice
hot cup of coffee?

26:12.304 --> 26:14.072
{\an3}It sure does taste
nice out here.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.340
It sounds great.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.008
{\an1}STEVE:
Oh, no. Oh, no.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.209
Ixnay the offee-kay.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.178
{\an1}We'll take care
of ourselves.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.246
Guys, this is ridiculous, okay?

26:21.313 --> 26:22.614
Can we just call a truce,

26:22.681 --> 26:24.149
please, something?

26:24.215 --> 26:26.084
{\an3}I mean, yeah, we were all
planning on going on a hike.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.352
You take a hike.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.687
We're going fishing.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.989
Come on, boys.

26:35.126 --> 26:38.797
{\an3}Why, why are they being
so stubborn?

26:38.863 --> 26:40.165
Do you really want me
to answer that?

26:40.231 --> 26:41.967
{\an3}Yes.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.702
{\an1}Because they know
they're wrong.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.304
Yep.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.304
{\an3}(huffs)

26:52.277 --> 26:54.245
Good morning.

26:55.313 --> 26:58.016
Good morning.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.317
Where are you going?

26:59.384 --> 27:00.919
{\an3}I have some
errands to run,

27:00.986 --> 27:02.988
and then I'm headed
over to the hospital.

27:03.054 --> 27:04.823
I have a session
with Dr. Browning.

27:04.889 --> 27:09.060
So, how are you feeling about
what happened last night?

27:09.127 --> 27:12.163
Truthfully,
I'm having second thoughts.

27:12.230 --> 27:17.002
I feel like I may have been
a little too hard on Greg.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.636
He's probably right,

27:18.703 --> 27:21.072
we shouldn't be rushing
into anything so fast.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.108
Well, maybe you'll see him
at the hospital

27:23.174 --> 27:25.176
and you can tell him
you're sorry.

27:25.243 --> 27:26.778
That's what I'm hoping for.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.246
{\an3}Well, I'll see
you later.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.748
Have a good day.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.748
{\an1}You too.

27:29.814 --> 27:30.982
Bye.

27:52.203 --> 27:53.738
Hi.

27:53.805 --> 27:57.075
Yes, I'd like to order
two bouquets of flowers.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.877
Mm-hmm.

27:58.943 --> 28:03.848
The first one is to be delivered
to Greg McKeen

28:03.915 --> 28:09.287
of L.A. Memorial Hospital,
Pediatrics.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.989
That's lovely.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.291
Yeah there's a note.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.894
"Dear Greg:

28:15.960 --> 28:20.065
"These flowers are the best way
that I can think of

28:20.131 --> 28:25.170
"to tell you not to call me
anymore.

28:25.236 --> 28:27.872
Regards, Kelly."

28:27.939 --> 28:30.141
How soon can those be delivered?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.776
That's great.

28:31.843 --> 28:37.215
The second are going to be
delivered to Kelly Taylor.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.984
Mm-hmm.

28:52.263 --> 28:53.731
Hey.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.033
{\an3}Hey, Val.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.136
Where's your father?

28:58.203 --> 28:59.437
Out walking the dog.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.906
{\an3}It's amazing how much
that guy can drink

29:01.973 --> 29:03.908
and still get up
in the morning.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.744
So, did you tell him?

29:06.811 --> 29:08.279
Tell him what?

29:08.346 --> 29:11.883
{\an1}I don't know, about
what's going on in your life.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.151
{\an1}That you might
be going to prison?

29:13.218 --> 29:15.186
(paintbrush clatters)

29:15.253 --> 29:17.455
{\an3}No.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.091
No. I didn't tell him.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.893
Well, why not?

29:21.960 --> 29:24.095
{\an3}Because I didn't want to take
the abuse, that's why.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.930
Things are bad enough already.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.166
Look, I think you're
making a big mistake.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.968
He's your father.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.069
You may need him.

29:31.136 --> 29:32.871
I've done just fine without him.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.140
Come on, he came all the way
out here to see you.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.408
You know, Valerie,
for a smart girl,

29:37.475 --> 29:39.777
{\an3}sometimes you say
a lot of dumb things.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.913
{\an3}Why do you think
he came back?

29:41.980 --> 29:43.414
Huh? 'Cause he missed
his sonny boy?

29:43.481 --> 29:46.084
I don't think so.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.852
He wants something.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.354
Probably money.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.423
You know, you just think

29:52.490 --> 29:55.160
the worst about people,
don't you?

29:55.226 --> 29:58.296
No, no I don't.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.831
Just my father.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.332
{\an1}You know what?
You'll see.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.168
{\an1}When he comes back,
he'll be all apologetic,

30:03.234 --> 30:05.003
{\an1}feeling good and sorry
for himself,

30:05.069 --> 30:06.070
{\an1}and then
he'll lay it out.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.273
Like father, like son.

30:10.341 --> 30:12.043
Nice.

30:14.179 --> 30:15.847
I'm sorry.

30:17.348 --> 30:19.484
I shouldn't have said that.

30:21.252 --> 30:22.187
(door opens)

30:24.289 --> 30:28.359
Boy, this city just keeps
getting weirder and weirder.

30:28.426 --> 30:30.094
There's enough freaks

30:30.161 --> 30:32.163
out there
for a three-ring sideshow.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.398
You know, it's not that bad.

30:33.464 --> 30:34.899
{\an1}(scoffs)
What do you know?

30:34.966 --> 30:36.034
You know,

30:36.100 --> 30:40.104
{\an3}I was thinking,
maybe we all could go

30:40.171 --> 30:42.240
{\an3}to the Peach Pit
for lunch.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.042
What do you say?

30:44.108 --> 30:45.109
{\an1}I'll check
with my secretary,

30:45.176 --> 30:47.278
{\an1}see if I can
squeeze it in.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.480
You know what? I'm sick
and tired of your attitude!

30:49.547 --> 30:51.082
{\an3}Let's get to
the bottom line, here.

30:51.149 --> 30:52.417
What do you want?

30:52.483 --> 30:54.252
Huh? How much?

30:54.319 --> 30:55.520
Colin...

30:55.587 --> 30:58.523
{\an3}Valerie, please...
just stay out of this.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.259
No. No, I am not gonna stay out
of this.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.895
You both are lucky
to have each other

31:03.962 --> 31:05.129
and you don't even know it!

31:08.166 --> 31:10.101
So who's going to extend
the first kind word here?

31:10.168 --> 31:11.236
{\an1}Huh?

31:11.302 --> 31:14.372
I'm not saying anything
until he tells me why he's here.

31:14.439 --> 31:15.974
{\an1}You want to know
why I'm here?

31:16.040 --> 31:16.975
{\an3}Yeah, I do.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.076
I'll tell you.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.278
Your mother called.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.447
Told me about
your legal problems.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.318
{\an1}I thought
you might need a hand.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.360
Why'd you wait so long
to tell me?

31:35.426 --> 31:36.527
Why did you?

31:41.165 --> 31:43.067
I must be blind.

31:43.134 --> 31:44.636
You don't need anyone.

31:44.702 --> 31:48.573
{\an1}You're doing great,
just terrific.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.142
Come on, Heidi.
Let's get out of here.

31:51.209 --> 31:54.078
Right, right, forward.

32:00.051 --> 32:03.354
If you let him go...

32:03.421 --> 32:05.323
I'm going too.

32:10.695 --> 32:11.996
Dad.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.077
I'm sorry.

32:26.144 --> 32:29.347
I should have told you.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.986
I didn't have the courage.

32:50.401 --> 32:53.037
Hi. Is Greg McKeen around?

32:53.104 --> 32:54.339
{\an3}He sure is,
just in the back.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.707
Who should I say is here?

32:55.773 --> 32:57.608
Kelly Taylor.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.345
{\an5}WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Harry Landers
to Pediatrics.

33:00.411 --> 33:03.214
Dr. Harry Landers to Pediatrics.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.585
I'm sorry.
Greg is very busy right now.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.321
{\an1}Oh, well, tell him
that'll just take a second.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.156
Um, I'm sorry.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.359
He said he didn't want
to see you.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.061
Oh...

33:17.128 --> 33:19.063
Okay.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.065
Tell him I said hello.

33:21.132 --> 33:22.533
{\an3}Certainly.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.116
{\an4}STEVE:
Think there's actually
any fish in here?

33:38.182 --> 33:40.385
{\an6}JOE:
Maybe we should have gone
on that hike with the girls.

33:40.451 --> 33:41.719
{\an3}At least we'd be
getting some exercise.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.254
Would you guys just relax.

33:43.321 --> 33:44.756
Of course
there's fish in here.

33:44.822 --> 33:46.057
This is fun.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.759
{\an5}(insects buzzing)

33:46.124 --> 33:47.759
Fun?

33:47.825 --> 33:49.761
{\an1}I think the mosquitoes
are having more fun.

33:49.827 --> 33:50.962
All right, knock it off
and concentrate.

33:51.028 --> 33:53.231
And stop talking so much,
you're scaring the fish away.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.199
{\an5}Scaring the fish?

33:53.297 --> 33:55.199
You're scaring the fish.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.501
Hey, don't look now,
here comes trouble.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.104
Hey, there.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.606
Guess we just can't stop
running into you.

34:01.672 --> 34:04.208
Yeah, maybe you guys
will bring us some luck.

34:04.275 --> 34:05.343
{\an3}What are you guys
using for bait?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.178
Night crawlers.

34:07.245 --> 34:09.080
{\an4}I used to catch them
with bubble gum.

34:07.245 --> 34:09.080
{\an3}STEVE:
Bubble gum?

34:09.147 --> 34:10.982
{\an5}Really?

34:09.147 --> 34:10.982
{\an3}Well, maybe we should
try that, guys.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.118
Have you guys seen our dates?

34:14.185 --> 34:15.453
Oh, yeah, sure,

34:15.520 --> 34:17.088
{\an3}a little while back
at the campsite.

34:17.155 --> 34:19.357
{\an5}Well, how are they
doing without us?

34:19.424 --> 34:21.092
Fine.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.060
{\an3}What are they
doing without us?

34:24.829 --> 34:27.231
{\an3}Well, they seemed to have
made some new friends.

34:27.297 --> 34:29.266
{\an1}Really. Who?
New neighbors?

34:29.333 --> 34:31.436
{\an3}We didn't catch
their names.

34:31.502 --> 34:33.103
{\an3}Just some guys who
were hanging around.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.605
{\an5}"Some guys"?

34:33.170 --> 34:34.605
{\an3}Yeah.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.641
They seemed
really nice.

34:36.706 --> 34:37.675
Really funny.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.143
Kind of cute, too.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.112
{\an5}(girls agreeing)

34:39.210 --> 34:41.112
Well listen, we're going

34:41.179 --> 34:42.780
to hike up to the ridge
and back before it gets dark,

34:42.847 --> 34:43.815
so we better get going.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.150
{\an5}See you later?

34:43.880 --> 34:46.150
Absolutely.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.385
{\an1}See you.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.385
See you guys.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.619
Bye.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.619
{\an1}Bye.

34:51.621 --> 34:52.824
No, I don't believe it.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.324
It's pretty obvious.

34:54.391 --> 34:56.194
How lame does it get?
What, did they think

34:56.260 --> 34:58.129
{\an1}we're going to be
jealous or something?

34:58.196 --> 34:59.597
So what do we do?

34:59.664 --> 35:01.766
Nothing,
we stay right here.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.268
{\an3}We do?

35:01.833 --> 35:04.268
Absolutely.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.636
{\an1}After what they
pulled last night.

35:05.703 --> 35:07.205
Oh, you betcha.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.239
We stay right
here and fish.

35:08.306 --> 35:09.273
What are we, men or mice?

35:09.340 --> 35:10.374
{\an5}Men!

35:09.340 --> 35:10.374
{\an3}Men.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.374
{\an1}Men.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.542
Fishing men.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.611
{\an1}(laughs):
Fishing men.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.450
Maybe we should go back.

35:19.517 --> 35:20.451
{\an5}Yeah.

35:19.517 --> 35:20.451
Yeah, come on.

35:20.518 --> 35:22.186
Yeah.

35:22.253 --> 35:24.255
{\an1}Go back and just
have a peek.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.157
{\an5}Roll 'em up.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.157
(grunts)

35:26.224 --> 35:28.459
{\an1}Not catching
anything anyway.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.130
(cheering on TV)

35:44.308 --> 35:45.510
Hey, Kel.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.578
Hi.

35:49.213 --> 35:50.615
{\an5}How was your day?

35:49.213 --> 35:50.615
(groans)

35:50.681 --> 35:52.416
Not so good.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.551
Why? What happened?

35:53.618 --> 35:56.153
Well, I went to see Greg,

35:56.220 --> 35:57.622
but he wouldn't see me.

35:57.688 --> 35:59.290
He's such a weirdo.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.459
I thought he said he wanted
to slow things down,

36:01.526 --> 36:03.194
not end them entirely.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.229
I'm so sorry.

36:05.296 --> 36:06.464
Oh, forget it.

36:06.531 --> 36:07.765
I always do this.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.667
I always get involved
way too quickly

36:09.734 --> 36:11.168
with some guy
I hardly even know.

36:13.404 --> 36:14.772
I just really liked him.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.574
I had a good feeling about it,
you know?

36:18.276 --> 36:19.944
I can't believe
I could be so wrong.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.178
(doorbell chimes)

36:21.245 --> 36:23.347
I'll get it.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.621
{\an3}Hey.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.621
Kelly Taylor?

36:30.688 --> 36:32.590
{\an5}Yeah, that's me.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.590
Sign here.

36:32.657 --> 36:34.625
{\an3}Thank you.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.627
Mm-hmm.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.627
Great.

36:40.765 --> 36:43.234
Wow, they're beautiful.

36:43.301 --> 36:44.235
Yeah.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.771
{\an5}I wonder who they're from?

36:44.302 --> 36:46.771
Well, read the card.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.475
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>"Dear Kelly, I care for you</i>
<i>a lot and wish you well,</i>

36:51.542 --> 36:53.277
<i>"but now is not a good time</i>
<i>for us.</i>

36:53.344 --> 36:55.880
<i>Good luck and all the best,</i>
<i>sincerely, Greg."</i>

36:56.914 --> 36:58.916
{\an1}Kel?

37:01.686 --> 37:03.521
I'm fine.

37:21.038 --> 37:23.341
How big is this?

37:23.407 --> 37:25.376
{\an3}Well, it's about
30-foot wide

37:25.443 --> 37:26.911
and about 15 feet high.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.316
{\an3}Come here, I want
to show you something.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.018
{\an3}I used the architecture
of the club

37:34.085 --> 37:35.553
so that the painted surfaces

37:35.620 --> 37:37.521
are all on several
different planes.

37:43.027 --> 37:45.329
It's good.

37:45.396 --> 37:46.964
You're getting better.

37:48.866 --> 37:50.935
{\an5}You really think so?

37:48.866 --> 37:50.935
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.971
And apparently,
so does everyone else.

37:54.038 --> 37:57.475
I read in <i> Art News</i> how
Sterling Penn

37:57.541 --> 37:59.910
bought two of your paintings
after seeing this piece.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.746
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

38:01.812 --> 38:02.980
He's a jerk.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.315
You make sure the check clears.

38:05.750 --> 38:06.984
It already did.

38:07.051 --> 38:08.352
(laughs)

38:08.419 --> 38:10.721
Good for you, son.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.028
Now you listen to me.

38:20.998 --> 38:22.566
Every lifetime...

38:25.536 --> 38:27.772
...has a little bit of rain.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.377
{\an3}This is just
your rainy season.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.315
{\an3}You trust me
when I tell you,

38:38.382 --> 38:40.951
your sun will shine again, huh?

38:44.622 --> 38:45.923
You believe me?

38:51.395 --> 38:53.964
Yeah.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.933
Yeah, I believe you.

39:02.540 --> 39:05.042
You've been a better son
than I've been a father.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.651
So what's the plan?

39:13.718 --> 39:15.019
I say we sneak up 'em,

39:15.086 --> 39:16.954
catch them in the act;
what do you say?

39:17.021 --> 39:18.823
{\an5}And then what?

39:17.021 --> 39:18.823
Well, then we kill them all

39:18.889 --> 39:20.991
{\an5}and let God sort it out.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.991
That a boy, Steve.

39:21.058 --> 39:23.060
{\an1}Something I saw
on a bumper sticker once.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.729
{\an3}Guys, uh,
hang on a sec.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.397
{\an3}Aren't we maybe
overreacting

39:26.464 --> 39:28.132
just a little bit here?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.734
{\an3}I mean, why
would the girls

39:29.800 --> 39:31.769
suddenly take up
with some other guys, huh?

39:31.836 --> 39:33.838
No, not just
some other guys,

39:33.904 --> 39:35.072
some other <i> cute</i> guys.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.741
{\an1}Well, you heard 'em
last night.

39:36.807 --> 39:37.875
{\an1}They thought
we were flirting.

39:37.942 --> 39:38.876
It's payback time.

39:38.943 --> 39:40.478
{\an1}Except we weren't
doing anything.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.612
That's right.
We weren't.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.614
{\an5}We weren't.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.614
No, excuse me guys,

39:43.681 --> 39:45.750
we were... a little.

39:45.816 --> 39:47.017
{\an1}Okay, let's see
how you feel

39:47.084 --> 39:48.652
{\an1}feel when we get
back to camp

39:48.719 --> 39:50.821
{\an1}and there's someone
else's arm around Donna.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.392
We better get going.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.029
That was good.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.807
When I was little,

40:09.874 --> 40:11.976
he used to take me
to the art museum,

40:12.042 --> 40:15.412
{\an3}and I'd sit on a bench
in the middle of the room.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.682
{\an3}And even though
he was blind,

40:18.749 --> 40:21.585
{\an3}he'd already memorized
every single piece in detail.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.624
He'd explain to me
the choice of colors

40:26.690 --> 40:29.093
and the brush techniques
of the masters.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.997
It was unbelievable.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.733
I'll never forget it.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.835
I wish he could have
stayed a little longer.

40:37.902 --> 40:40.838
Nah, it's not his style.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.506
Mm-mmm.

40:42.573 --> 40:45.009
Besides, he's-he's with me now

40:45.075 --> 40:47.645
in a way he hasn't been
for a long, long time.

40:48.679 --> 40:50.681
I'm glad.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.084
You know, I miss
my dad everyday.

40:56.153 --> 40:58.956
But more and more, I realize
what he actually gave me.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.993
{\an3}Well, I know what my
old man gave me.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.830
He may have been blind,

41:05.896 --> 41:07.998
but...

41:08.065 --> 41:11.068
he taught me how to see.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.507
You know,
I'm really proud of you.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.175
Thanks.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.244
{\an3}Thank you.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.087
{\an3}STEVE:
What do you see?

41:30.154 --> 41:32.890
I don't believe it.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.959
Give me those.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.695
Where are the guys?

41:37.761 --> 41:38.996
{\an1}JOE:
Let me have a look.

41:43.601 --> 41:46.503
{\an1}Looks like they're
just cooking dinner.

41:46.570 --> 41:47.738
Yeah, but for who?

41:47.805 --> 41:48.906
Let's go find out.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.009
{\an1}I can't believe
they're watching us.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.777
Here they come.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.779
Okay, just pretend
you're surprised.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.781
Oh look, they think
they're so sneaky.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.617
Oh, hi, guys.

41:59.683 --> 42:00.851
{\an3}So, did you catch
any fish?

42:00.918 --> 42:02.219
No, they're all
too small.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.054
{\an5}We threw them back.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.054
{\an3}Aw, that's
too bad,

42:04.121 --> 42:06.090
we were hoping to
have a fish fry.

42:06.156 --> 42:08.092
(girls laugh)

42:06.156 --> 42:08.092
{\an3}Really?

42:08.158 --> 42:09.226
For how many?

42:09.293 --> 42:10.828
{\an1}What are you
talking about?

42:10.895 --> 42:12.129
{\an3}JOE:
Oh, come on, Donna.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.265
You think we don't know
what you guys are up to?

42:15.299 --> 42:16.267
Yeah. Where are they?

42:16.333 --> 42:17.801
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

42:17.868 --> 42:18.869
{\an3}To who?

42:18.936 --> 42:20.537
{\an1}The guys you've been
hanging out with.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.306
Oh, oh, you mean Hook.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.174
Hook? Hook who?

42:24.241 --> 42:24.942
{\an3}Oh, line!

42:25.009 --> 42:26.310
{\an1}(laughs)

42:26.377 --> 42:27.978
I think I see a pattern forming.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.880
And sinker!

42:29.947 --> 42:31.048
{\an3}CLARE:
Ha, ha.

42:31.115 --> 42:32.716
We're kidding,
we set you up.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.151
{\an4}There aren't
any guys.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.151
Ha, ha, ha, ha,

42:34.218 --> 42:35.586
Clare.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.655
{\an3}Busted!

42:38.656 --> 42:39.924
Jealous, maybe
just a little?

42:39.990 --> 42:41.558
Hardly.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.558
Yeah, well,

42:41.625 --> 42:43.894
{\an1}that's not what our little, uh,
Canadian friends told us.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.763
{\an3}Oh, yeah, well I hope
you guys are proud

42:45.829 --> 42:46.964
of yourselves.

42:45.829 --> 42:46.964
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.666
{\an3}Yeah, well now that
we're even,

42:48.732 --> 42:50.134
{\an3}we have something
to say to you.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.669
This better be good.

42:51.735 --> 42:52.903
{\an3}Well,

42:52.970 --> 42:54.905
{\an1}we were a little
hard on you,

42:54.972 --> 42:57.074
{\an1}and the truth
of the matter is

42:57.141 --> 43:00.878
{\an1}we were a little jealous,
so we overreacted a little.

43:00.945 --> 43:02.947
Yeah, and we're not
ashamed to admit it.

43:03.013 --> 43:06.083
Well, we have to admit
that, we were flirting.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.085
{\an3}And it was inconsiderate
of us, right, guys?

43:08.152 --> 43:09.887
Not.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.188
Speak for yourself.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.624
{\an3}Uh, okay, maybe
a little.

43:13.691 --> 43:15.059
We're sorry, too.

43:15.125 --> 43:16.026
Thank you.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.028
That's what we wanted
to hear.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.596
You guys are
the greatest.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.732
{\an3}Well, we hoped you'd
figure that out.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.034
Come over here.

43:24.101 --> 43:27.037
Some bait I'm using--
it's a special lure.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.872
It's the love hook.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.007
(laughing)

43:30.074 --> 43:32.076
Woo!
