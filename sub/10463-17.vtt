00:06.480 --> 00:07.498
Jill!

00:07.522 --> 00:10.116
Right. Thanks a lot. Later.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074

00:31.380 --> 00:32.314
Need a light?

00:32.339 --> 00:33.515
Thanks, man.

00:35.217 --> 00:36.402
Sorry.

00:36.426 --> 00:37.811
It's okay.

00:39.763 --> 00:41.157
So, uh...

00:41.181 --> 00:43.108
So, look, I was wondering
if you could help me out.

00:44.601 --> 00:47.779
I'm, uh, I'm looking to...
to buy.

00:49.940 --> 00:51.616
And you're coming to me?

00:52.484 --> 00:54.202
I... I'm a friend of Jill...

00:54.528 --> 00:55.713
Holbrook's.

00:55.737 --> 00:57.247
Oh, Jill.

00:57.656 --> 00:59.040
So, uh...

00:59.199 --> 01:01.094
so what could I get for...

01:01.118 --> 01:02.387
for, like, 20 bucks?

01:02.411 --> 01:04.045
Anything you want, man.

01:04.370 --> 01:05.755
Just name it.

01:14.423 --> 01:17.726
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live ♪</i>

01:17.801 --> 01:19.529
<i>♪ Like they wanna live ♪</i>

01:19.553 --> 01:22.824
<i>♪ And everybody wants to love ♪</i>

01:22.848 --> 01:24.409
<i>♪ Like they wanna love ♪</i>

01:24.433 --> 01:27.610
<i>♪ Everybody wants to be ♪</i>

01:28.270 --> 01:33.074
<i>♪ Closer to free ♪</i>

01:33.150 --> 01:36.202
<i>♪ Closer to free ♪</i>

01:42.159 --> 01:43.636
Okay, so what's another example

01:43.660 --> 01:46.139
of the poet using an
ordinary, everyday image

01:46.163 --> 01:47.598
as a romantic metaphor?

01:47.622 --> 01:48.516
Caroline?

01:48.540 --> 01:51.519
"You're wrapped up in
yourself like a spool"?

01:51.543 --> 01:53.470
That's a simile. But good.

01:53.670 --> 01:54.647
Evan?

01:54.671 --> 01:57.025
"You're vague as fog and
looked for like mail."

01:57.049 --> 01:58.192
Yep.

01:58.216 --> 01:59.944
Now, that's the one
place in the poem

01:59.968 --> 02:02.488
where the poet directly
implicates himself.

02:02.512 --> 02:04.490
"You are looked for."

02:04.514 --> 02:06.743
"I look for you."

02:06.767 --> 02:11.279
It's that simple. "You
are what I want."

02:17.152 --> 02:18.921
Owen's going down for his nap.

02:18.945 --> 02:20.288
Sweet dreams, sweetie.

02:22.407 --> 02:24.042
Why don't you put him down?

02:24.409 --> 02:25.470
I'm in the middle.

02:25.494 --> 02:28.213
Ah, come on, Charlie. He wants you to.
Look at him.

02:31.374 --> 02:33.760
He doesn't care who
puts him down.

02:36.088 --> 02:37.263
What?

02:37.464 --> 02:39.724
Yesterday you put his
diaper on backward.

02:39.883 --> 02:42.268
The absorbent part goes in
front, where he tinkles.

02:43.011 --> 02:44.354
Thanks for the tip.

02:45.847 --> 02:47.366
I feel a lecture coming on here.

02:47.390 --> 02:48.775
No lecture.

02:49.768 --> 02:51.412
You guys are great with Owen.

02:51.436 --> 02:53.748
It's just, you act like
brothers and sisters around him

02:53.772 --> 02:54.832
when what he really should have

02:54.856 --> 02:56.334
is someone who acts
like a father.

02:56.358 --> 02:58.535
Don't quote your textbooks
back to me, Kirsten.

02:59.778 --> 03:00.922
How many words does he say?

03:00.946 --> 03:02.997
- I'm not playing this game.
- Five.

03:03.156 --> 03:04.300
Five words.

03:04.324 --> 03:05.635
He says "baba" for bottle,

03:05.659 --> 03:07.386
"bana" for banana, he says "no,"

03:07.410 --> 03:09.462
he says "mine," and
he says "Bill."

03:12.082 --> 03:13.758
He says Bill?

03:15.126 --> 03:16.386
Tim.

03:17.337 --> 03:18.930
Don't remember you
mentioning him.

03:21.007 --> 03:24.028
We went to this Guns N' Roses
concert before I met you.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.530
He said he had backstage passes,

03:25.554 --> 03:27.272
so I figured, you
know, what the hell.

03:27.931 --> 03:29.492
Well, turns out he didn't,

03:29.516 --> 03:32.495
and then there was this nightmare scene
backstage with the bouncer and...

03:32.519 --> 03:34.863
Anyway... Come on.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.448
Dance with me.

03:36.815 --> 03:39.409
So you two, like... Dated?

03:40.152 --> 03:43.371
No, We went to a concert once.

03:43.446 --> 03:44.715
He's a creep.

03:44.739 --> 03:46.207
Why?

03:46.491 --> 03:48.126
- He just is.
- Why?

03:48.326 --> 03:49.595
Did he...

03:49.619 --> 03:51.264
Did he try something with you?

03:51.288 --> 03:52.306
Did he make a move?

03:52.330 --> 03:53.756
What didn't you like about him?

03:54.749 --> 03:56.593
He deals, okay?

03:57.586 --> 03:59.564
I didn't know it
when we went out,

03:59.588 --> 04:02.140
and when I found out, I told
him I wasn't interested.

04:02.757 --> 04:03.776
He just...

04:03.800 --> 04:05.810
He didn't get it, you know?

04:06.261 --> 04:07.238
And then today,

04:07.262 --> 04:08.573
he puts this note in my locker

04:08.597 --> 04:12.525
saying I still owe him $25 for
the concert, which I do not,

04:13.059 --> 04:15.037
and he can just go to hell,
as far as I'm concerned,

04:15.061 --> 04:17.488
which is exactly what I told
him in the parking lot.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.543
I'm not doing anything, Bailey.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.911
I'm not.

04:26.698 --> 04:28.092
All right, you want
to see the note?

04:28.116 --> 04:29.677
I've got it in my jacket.
Let me just go...

04:29.701 --> 04:30.720
No.

04:30.744 --> 04:32.086
No, it's okay.

04:34.998 --> 04:36.809
Listen, I don't
have time to cook.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.144
I have a date with Owen,

04:38.168 --> 04:40.146
so either one of you two
cooks, or we bring in.

04:40.170 --> 04:41.856
How about Chinese?

04:41.880 --> 04:43.890
There's that new
Szechuan place on Union.

04:44.132 --> 04:45.193
Artie, you're still here?

04:45.217 --> 04:46.360
I thought you left hours ago.

04:46.384 --> 04:47.810
Is he permanent?

04:48.261 --> 04:50.563
I'm serving two meals a day.

04:50.722 --> 04:52.408
Want Szechuan for dinner, Jule?

04:52.432 --> 04:54.776
Oh, it's up to you. I'm
not gonna be here anyway.

04:54.809 --> 04:55.786
I'm studying with Justin.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.779
- Big test tomorrow?
- No.

04:58.271 --> 04:59.531
Is this you?

05:00.732 --> 05:04.295
Drawing self-portraits in class? Kind of
on the conceited side, don't you think?

05:04.319 --> 05:06.120
I didn't draw it. Justin did.

05:06.363 --> 05:07.381
Why?

05:07.405 --> 05:08.790
Well, just because...

05:08.949 --> 05:09.967
Because...

05:09.991 --> 05:11.552
He drew a picture of you?

05:11.576 --> 05:12.887
Yeah.

05:12.911 --> 05:14.170
You two aren't...?

05:14.454 --> 05:16.130
Kind of, I guess.

05:16.581 --> 05:17.757
Huh.

05:18.124 --> 05:19.560
I need an answer on
the Szechuan, guys.

05:19.584 --> 05:20.811
Szechuan's good.

05:20.835 --> 05:22.939
I was gonna tell you
guys about him.

05:22.963 --> 05:24.315
I thought you
didn't like Justin.

05:24.339 --> 05:26.692
Yeah, I thought you thought
he was, kind of a nerd.

05:26.716 --> 05:28.643
No, no. He's great.

05:29.219 --> 05:30.687
Well, are you gonna kiss him?

05:30.845 --> 05:31.822
Claud...

05:31.846 --> 05:33.690
I mean, you've known
him all your life.

05:34.099 --> 05:35.900
Jule, isn't that kind of like...

05:35.934 --> 05:37.318
kissing Bailey?

05:37.686 --> 05:40.498
Hey, a lot of people would give their
right arms, I'll have you know.

05:40.522 --> 05:42.583
I mean, there are,
like, friends,

05:42.607 --> 05:44.001
and there are, like, boyfriends.

05:44.025 --> 05:45.169
Claudia, shut up.

05:45.193 --> 05:47.704
So we're all definitely
decided on Szechuan, then?

05:48.530 --> 05:50.383
Thanks for being so
great about this.

05:50.407 --> 05:52.009
Don't expect me
home for a while.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.710
I got invited to
stay for dinner.

05:56.913 --> 05:58.015
I've got an idea.

05:58.039 --> 06:00.049
Why don't you stay
for dinner, Artie?

06:03.586 --> 06:05.054
You want to try?

06:06.172 --> 06:07.692
Fractions.

06:07.716 --> 06:09.392
I'll go again.

06:10.468 --> 06:12.020
Artie...

06:13.096 --> 06:14.897
I'm 11 years old.

06:14.973 --> 06:17.692
I am just too young to
be living with someone.

06:18.309 --> 06:19.944
You want me to go home.

06:20.061 --> 06:21.414
You're just...

06:21.438 --> 06:23.531
You're getting a little clingy.

06:24.774 --> 06:25.950
Fine.

06:26.109 --> 06:27.410
I'll call my dad.

06:27.736 --> 06:29.964
Do you have, like, some really
yucky relative visiting

06:29.988 --> 06:31.289
you don't want to see?

06:31.740 --> 06:32.800
Forget it.

06:32.824 --> 06:34.677
- Artie...
- It's none of your business.

06:34.701 --> 06:36.762
Well, when you're
here all the time,

06:36.786 --> 06:38.588
it sort of is my business.

06:39.789 --> 06:41.132
Jerk.

06:46.171 --> 06:48.306
It's my mom and dad, okay?

06:49.174 --> 06:51.652
They're just...
fighting all the time.

06:51.676 --> 06:54.520
You can pretty much hear them
all the way down the block.

06:55.346 --> 06:57.033
My dad's sleeping
in the guest room

06:57.057 --> 06:59.275
and my mom cries a lot.

07:00.018 --> 07:01.402
I just...

07:01.895 --> 07:03.613
don't want to be there.

07:06.066 --> 07:08.002
They're gonna split up.

07:08.026 --> 07:09.744
You can tell.

07:14.199 --> 07:16.459
<i>The Exorcist</i> is
on cable tonight.

07:16.534 --> 07:18.346
I always wanted to see it,

07:18.370 --> 07:20.306
but I can't watch it alone.

07:20.330 --> 07:21.673
Too scary.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.801
What do you say?

07:25.502 --> 07:27.804
And then the doctor turned
to me and he says...

07:28.046 --> 07:31.057
He says, "Do you want
to cut the cord?"

07:33.134 --> 07:36.312
There I was, holding
this mucousy kid,

07:37.514 --> 07:39.075
and he's the most
beautiful thing

07:39.099 --> 07:40.608
I've ever seen in my life...

07:42.143 --> 07:43.403
And...

07:43.853 --> 07:44.872
I'm... I'm sorry.

07:44.896 --> 07:46.406
Just thinking about
that moment...

07:47.315 --> 07:50.118
Would any of our other
daddies like to share?

07:50.443 --> 07:51.670
I was, uh...

07:51.694 --> 07:53.672
I was leaving to go
to work this morning,

07:53.696 --> 07:56.708
and Michael was sitting
in his highchair,

07:57.033 --> 07:59.762
and he holds his arms
out to me and he says,

07:59.786 --> 08:00.962
"Bup."

08:02.122 --> 08:04.090
Cassie said "bup" last week.

08:04.124 --> 08:05.434
Patrick said "dada."

08:05.458 --> 08:07.385
Has that happened to you yet?

08:08.294 --> 08:10.763
I'm telling you, when it does...

08:13.341 --> 08:14.652
I'm sorry.

08:14.676 --> 08:16.070
I never used to be like this.

08:16.094 --> 08:17.780
I guess it's becoming a father.

08:17.804 --> 08:20.606
Well, how about you, Charlie?

08:20.765 --> 08:22.785
Why don't you tell
us how having, uh,

08:22.809 --> 08:25.361
Owen has changed your life?

08:26.271 --> 08:27.998
Gee. How to answer
that question?

08:28.022 --> 08:30.616
Um, how has Owen
changed my life?

08:33.486 --> 08:34.672
You know what? I'm
going to, uh...

08:34.696 --> 08:36.414
I'm going to pass.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.842
So this is like a
full-time shelter?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.428
Oh, we can't afford that yet.

08:40.452 --> 08:43.254
Not until we get these
requests mailed out.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.141
I'm licking as fast as I can.

08:45.165 --> 08:46.674
Good. Don't stop.

08:46.791 --> 08:49.510
We're open twice a week.
Fridays and Saturdays.

08:49.544 --> 08:52.680
We serve about, oh... 500 meals.

08:53.339 --> 08:55.433
We can always use
another volunteer.

08:56.468 --> 08:58.112
Maybe some Friday?

08:58.136 --> 08:59.687
Friday?

08:59.721 --> 09:01.230
What?

09:01.347 --> 09:03.784
Oh. That's a big
date night, huh?

09:03.808 --> 09:04.702
Am I right?

09:04.726 --> 09:06.036
Yeah, kind of, Mom.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.874
Well, maybe Julia's seeing the
kind of guy who happens to think

09:09.898 --> 09:11.125
that serving turkey
to the homeless

09:11.149 --> 09:13.242
is the basis for a
romantic evening.

09:13.693 --> 09:15.995
Are you seeing that kind of guy?

09:16.404 --> 09:17.789
Um, I'm not sure.

09:18.156 --> 09:20.009
Don't give me that look.

09:20.033 --> 09:23.387
This happens to be my favorite
person under the age of 20...

09:23.411 --> 09:24.722
After you, dear.

09:24.746 --> 09:25.681
Thank you.

09:25.705 --> 09:27.641
If she's in love,
I want to know,

09:27.665 --> 09:29.643
and if it's with someone
with a social conscience,

09:29.667 --> 09:30.885
I want to sign him up.

09:31.377 --> 09:32.887
What's his name?

09:33.254 --> 09:34.398
Justin.

09:34.422 --> 09:36.150
Oh, that's a coincidence.

09:36.174 --> 09:38.184
No, Mom. It really isn't.

09:38.968 --> 09:40.520
What?

09:40.762 --> 09:42.406
Are you tell...

09:42.430 --> 09:43.731
You guys?

09:44.974 --> 09:46.827
Why didn't you say anything?

09:46.851 --> 09:49.705
I was trying to maintain the
illusion of a private life.

09:49.729 --> 09:50.998
Oh, please.

09:51.022 --> 09:52.583
Oh, my gosh. This...

09:52.607 --> 09:54.585
Oh, you have made my night.

09:54.609 --> 09:56.202
You made my whole week.

09:56.903 --> 10:00.039
I'm going to get you some
more envelopes, Romeo.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.086
I really wish that
hadn't happened.

10:06.204 --> 10:08.682
You said they could
watch <i>The Exorcist?</i>

10:08.706 --> 10:09.850
No.

10:09.874 --> 10:11.143
I said they could
watch <i>The Parent Trap</i>

10:11.167 --> 10:12.718
until Artie's dad gets here.

10:14.963 --> 10:17.233
You guys better turn that
thing off, right now.

10:17.257 --> 10:18.891
But her head's spinning around.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.893
Now!

10:22.804 --> 10:24.188
Hey, what are you...

10:24.722 --> 10:26.148
Oh, my God. What happened?

10:26.182 --> 10:28.744
I wrecked my brother's car a
couple of blocks from here.

10:28.768 --> 10:30.287
I ran into one of
those dumpsters.

10:30.311 --> 10:31.529
Are you okay?

10:31.646 --> 10:33.332
That hill at Divisadero
is really steep,

10:33.356 --> 10:35.241
and I'm not really
good with the clutch.

10:35.817 --> 10:37.503
Oh, my God, Griffin
is gonna kill me.

10:37.527 --> 10:40.005
Let me see. That's really deep.

10:40.029 --> 10:41.966
He doesn't even know
that I took it, Bailey.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.457
I was gonna leave a note and...

10:43.575 --> 10:46.085
Wait. Did I? Did I leave a note?

10:46.369 --> 10:48.556
No. No!

10:48.580 --> 10:50.307
God, I should've taken Van Ness,

10:50.331 --> 10:52.309
because, you know, I'm just
not good on the hills,

10:52.333 --> 10:53.561
but I wasn't thinking about it.

10:53.585 --> 10:54.895
I wasn't thinking, Bailey.

10:54.919 --> 10:56.220
It's okay.

10:56.504 --> 10:58.097
Come here. You're okay.

11:05.972 --> 11:07.398
Shh, you're okay.

11:11.519 --> 11:13.789
It's really bad. We should
go to the hospital.

11:13.813 --> 11:15.916
No, I'm sure if we just
keep pressure on it...

11:15.940 --> 11:17.084
You're gonna need stitches.

11:17.108 --> 11:18.909
No, I won't.

11:19.319 --> 11:20.879
We should have someone
look at it at least, okay?

11:20.903 --> 11:22.047
You could have a concussion.

11:22.071 --> 11:23.799
- I don't. I'd know.
- Not necessarily.

11:23.823 --> 11:25.592
Come on, I'd feel better if
we had someone look at it

11:25.616 --> 11:27.011
and we knew for sure.

11:27.035 --> 11:28.919
Why don't you want to go
to the hospital, Jill?

11:30.538 --> 11:31.881
Because...

11:31.998 --> 11:33.434
Because look at it.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.519
It's, like, right
near my hairline.

11:35.543 --> 11:37.688
I mean, they'd probably
shave my head and,

11:37.712 --> 11:39.064
I'd look like a total jerk.

11:39.088 --> 11:40.649
It'd take forever to grow back

11:40.673 --> 11:42.224
and all I need is a Band-Aid.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.153
Look, my mom is a nurse, okay?

11:44.177 --> 11:45.863
I know how to deal
with these things.

11:45.887 --> 11:48.198
They'd check your blood pressure
at the hospital, wouldn't they?

11:48.222 --> 11:49.616
They'd check your pupils.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.035
That's what you're
worried about, isn't it?

11:51.059 --> 11:52.318
What?

11:52.894 --> 11:54.236
No.

11:54.812 --> 11:55.748
No.

11:55.772 --> 11:57.573
They'd see that
you're on something.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.243
She's high, Bay.

12:04.197 --> 12:05.623
Bailey...

12:06.324 --> 12:08.084
God. Jill...

12:12.914 --> 12:14.507
I don't believe you.

12:14.916 --> 12:16.518
I had trouble with the clutch.

12:16.542 --> 12:17.686
You've driven with me.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.897
You know I'm not good
with stick shifts,

12:19.921 --> 12:21.607
and I'm scared of
hospitals, all right?

12:21.631 --> 12:23.641
That's why I don't
want to go to one.

12:24.801 --> 12:27.237
But I guess that's
not allowed, huh?

12:27.261 --> 12:28.822
I guess I can't make
any more mistakes.

12:28.846 --> 12:30.199
I guess I can't do a
single thing wrong

12:30.223 --> 12:31.732
without you thinking...

12:34.852 --> 12:36.570
I thought I could come to you.

12:37.188 --> 12:38.698
I thought you'd help.

12:41.025 --> 12:42.326
Well...

12:43.611 --> 12:45.287
My mistake, huh?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.559
"In the land of Roly-Poly

12:57.583 --> 12:58.936
lived a fuzzy-wuzzy bunny

12:58.960 --> 13:00.979
with some furry on his tummy."

13:01.003 --> 13:02.513
What a picture.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.181
Look at you.

13:04.590 --> 13:08.853
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'll just... Go on.

13:09.011 --> 13:10.271
Keep going.

13:13.141 --> 13:15.953
"And the mommy and the daddy
of this fluffy, funny bunny

13:15.977 --> 13:17.996
were so happy and so peppy

13:18.020 --> 13:20.207
with the baby they named Sunny.

13:20.231 --> 13:22.000
All the hopping and the skipping

13:22.024 --> 13:23.951
of these silly-willy bunnies..."

13:25.611 --> 13:26.964
I can't do this.

13:26.988 --> 13:29.373
I mean, this is...

13:29.824 --> 13:31.625
I got a better idea.

13:32.368 --> 13:35.337
You don't mind if I kill two
birds with one stone, do you?

13:37.206 --> 13:38.883
Okay.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.886
Once upon a time, a prince,

13:42.420 --> 13:44.440
who runs a small
furniture-building business,

13:44.464 --> 13:46.307
had to replace his band saw,

13:46.716 --> 13:48.569
and he went to a magical place

13:48.593 --> 13:51.363
where they sold all different
models of band saws,

13:51.387 --> 13:53.355
including...

13:53.514 --> 13:56.410
this one with "variable
speed and safety shield"

13:56.434 --> 13:58.652
for under 800 bucks.

13:59.395 --> 14:01.489
Not bad, huh?

14:03.399 --> 14:05.367
Why are you skimping?
Put more lima beans on.

14:05.401 --> 14:06.827
I hate lima beans.

14:11.532 --> 14:12.593
What?

14:12.617 --> 14:14.136
- How you guys doing?
- Well, he's a little slow.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.170
We're trying to get him
to pick up the pace.

14:16.329 --> 14:17.890
Let's not ask for miracles.

14:17.914 --> 14:20.517
The fact you got him down here in
the first place is enough for me.

14:20.541 --> 14:21.769
You mean he's never
volunteered before?

14:21.793 --> 14:23.177
I can't believe it. Justin...

14:24.045 --> 14:25.397
Oh, you hang on to
this one, Justin.

14:25.421 --> 14:27.306
This one I love.

14:29.425 --> 14:31.653
Just so you know,
when I get home,

14:31.677 --> 14:33.322
I'm gonna dump you
for another girl.

14:33.346 --> 14:34.698
I love your sense of humor.

14:34.722 --> 14:35.699
What?

14:35.723 --> 14:37.201
Don't you hear me laughing?

14:37.225 --> 14:39.944
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm
having a fantastic time.

14:40.144 --> 14:42.831
I mean, this is my
dream Saturday,

14:42.855 --> 14:45.074
and you, you're my dream date.

14:45.274 --> 14:48.086
I mean, that Woody Allen
double feature at the Corona?

14:48.110 --> 14:49.379
Stupid idea.

14:49.403 --> 14:50.672
Hike in Muir Woods?

14:50.696 --> 14:52.123
Who needs exercise?

14:52.156 --> 14:54.551
Ice skating? You
could hurt yourself.

14:54.575 --> 14:57.378
But, no. Look at you.
You look fantastic.

14:57.829 --> 14:59.973
I mean, when I dream about you,

14:59.997 --> 15:01.882
this is exactly how you look.

15:02.917 --> 15:04.937
Do you have any idea
how shallow you sound,

15:04.961 --> 15:06.230
standing in the middle
of a soup kitchen,

15:06.254 --> 15:07.930
whining about ice skating?

15:08.506 --> 15:10.474
I'm ashamed of you.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.643
Next tray.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.732
Do you want to talk?

15:18.808 --> 15:20.276
Nope.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.413
You can't just lie around
on the sofa all day.

15:23.437 --> 15:25.541
It's not going to make
things better at your house.

15:25.565 --> 15:26.866
No kidding.

15:27.191 --> 15:30.003
For your information,
I'm running away, okay?

15:30.027 --> 15:32.454
I'm not solving problems.
I'm avoiding them.

15:32.989 --> 15:34.540
Fine.

15:34.949 --> 15:36.917
What am I supposed to do?

15:39.912 --> 15:41.964
You really think there's
something I can do?

15:42.456 --> 15:44.383
Yeah, I do.

15:45.084 --> 15:47.803
We could come up with,
like, some kind of plan,

15:48.129 --> 15:51.056
like... do something
really romantic for them.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.694
This doesn't sound very
sophisticated to me.

15:53.718 --> 15:55.487
I just started
thinking about it.

15:55.511 --> 15:57.438
Give me a minute. Jeez!

16:00.975 --> 16:03.319
Do you think your parents
should stay together?

16:04.312 --> 16:05.789
I mean,

16:05.813 --> 16:08.949
do you think they love each
other enough to stay together?

16:12.361 --> 16:13.746
Yeah.

16:14.989 --> 16:16.582
Well, okay then.

16:30.838 --> 16:32.107
Called her house a while ago.

16:32.131 --> 16:33.349
Yeah?

16:33.424 --> 16:34.735
Talk to her?

16:34.759 --> 16:36.403
No. Her kid sister.

16:36.427 --> 16:37.895
Said she's okay.

16:39.805 --> 16:42.358
Turns out the brother's
got insurance, so...

16:43.684 --> 16:45.152
That's lucky, huh?

16:48.230 --> 16:50.074
Got to get her to stop driving.

16:50.191 --> 16:51.919
You know, I mean, she's a
nervous driver, anyway.

16:51.943 --> 16:53.462
She's, like, totally distracted,

16:53.486 --> 16:54.796
so that's the first
thing, right?

16:54.820 --> 16:57.039
Get her to stop driving.
That's, like, step one,

16:57.156 --> 16:58.624
and then...

17:00.701 --> 17:02.836
Then...

17:03.829 --> 17:05.714
You know what I
can't figure out?

17:06.707 --> 17:08.384
Why do you need this, Bay?

17:09.335 --> 17:11.136
Need what?

17:11.587 --> 17:13.690
It's always something
with this girl, you know?

17:13.714 --> 17:15.891
I mean, one problem
after another, so...

17:15.967 --> 17:18.111
I mean, what makes
it all worthwhile?

17:18.135 --> 17:20.020
There's good stuff.

17:20.346 --> 17:22.772
In between all the problems,
there's good stuff.

17:23.808 --> 17:25.025
Like what?

17:25.476 --> 17:26.662
Sex?

17:26.685 --> 17:28.444
No. Not that.

17:30.022 --> 17:32.032
Not just that.

17:33.651 --> 17:35.536
She's not a bad person.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.539
She's not. She's...

17:40.658 --> 17:42.844
I just...

17:42.868 --> 17:44.461
care about her.

17:52.128 --> 17:54.471
Is caring about her
the attraction?

17:54.797 --> 17:56.974
Because... you do that, Bay.

17:57.174 --> 17:58.851
You take care of people.

17:59.135 --> 18:01.353
I'm not saying that's
a bad thing, but...

18:02.555 --> 18:04.690
sometimes it's okay to
think about yourself.

18:05.683 --> 18:08.402
I just think you need to ask
yourself why you're doing this.

18:08.728 --> 18:10.237
Helping her.

18:10.604 --> 18:12.749
Saving her. Maybe that's...

18:12.773 --> 18:14.167
Maybe that's really about you.

18:14.191 --> 18:15.951
Are you gonna shoot or what?

18:17.737 --> 18:19.288
Come on, Bay.

18:27.705 --> 18:28.765
What are you saying?

18:28.789 --> 18:30.591
You'd actually rather your
parents didn't like me?

18:30.833 --> 18:32.310
Yeah, well...

18:32.334 --> 18:34.845
Even better if they hated
you with a passion.

18:35.421 --> 18:37.691
Then we'd... We'd have
to meet in secret

18:37.715 --> 18:39.192
and in the shadows,

18:39.216 --> 18:40.569
and at night, I'd have to climb

18:40.593 --> 18:41.820
the lattice outside your window.

18:41.844 --> 18:43.822
There's no lattice
outside my window.

18:43.846 --> 18:45.282
I mean, even just holding hands,

18:45.306 --> 18:46.742
it would feel kind of...

18:46.766 --> 18:48.067
illicit.

18:48.684 --> 18:49.870
I mean, don't you know,

18:49.894 --> 18:51.663
the greatest love
stories in history

18:51.687 --> 18:52.956
are about two people

18:52.980 --> 18:55.959
overcoming tremendous odds
to be with each other?

18:55.983 --> 18:58.952
Race, religion,
insane parents...

18:59.487 --> 19:00.881
I mean, us...

19:00.905 --> 19:02.664
we've got everything
going for us.

19:03.032 --> 19:06.377
It's me, you, and my
parents against the world.

19:07.411 --> 19:08.962
It's not funny.

19:13.751 --> 19:14.936
What's this?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.313
It's nothing. It's...

19:16.337 --> 19:17.481
It's nothing.

19:17.505 --> 19:19.264
It's, uh... It's a poem.

19:20.007 --> 19:21.725
Can I...

19:30.101 --> 19:32.027
You wrote this about me.

19:33.145 --> 19:36.740
No, actually, it's about this
other chick I'm dating, not you.

19:40.569 --> 19:42.788
Hey, Char.

19:43.114 --> 19:44.665
Where've you been?

19:45.116 --> 19:46.093
Out with Justin.

19:46.117 --> 19:48.261
You were supposed to go grocery
shopping today. It's your turn.

19:48.285 --> 19:49.795
I'll go. It's just, uh...

19:50.454 --> 19:52.015
We had this incredible date.

19:52.039 --> 19:53.350
Yeah, well, Owen ran
out of diapers,

19:53.374 --> 19:54.842
and I had to pick them up.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.020
I'm not the only one who takes
care of him around here.

19:57.044 --> 19:58.595
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

19:58.671 --> 20:00.180
Great.

20:02.967 --> 20:04.351
What?

20:04.969 --> 20:06.186
Nothing.

20:06.470 --> 20:07.781
I just, uh...

20:07.805 --> 20:09.440
had a date with Justin.

20:10.349 --> 20:12.410
Oh, yeah? Great.

20:12.434 --> 20:14.246
Yeah, it was. It was nice.

20:14.270 --> 20:16.039
Kind of foggy and romantic and...

20:16.063 --> 20:17.457
You know what? You
know what, Jule?

20:17.481 --> 20:19.491
I'm kind of not in the
mood right now, okay?

20:20.109 --> 20:22.161
Oh, okay. Sure.

20:25.948 --> 20:27.134
Can I just...

20:27.158 --> 20:28.260
show you this one thing? I mean,

20:28.284 --> 20:29.835
I know you'll think
it's dumb, but...

20:29.994 --> 20:31.253
What?

20:32.246 --> 20:33.547
Nothing.

20:34.707 --> 20:35.883
Huh?

20:36.709 --> 20:38.302
It doesn't rhyme.

20:38.586 --> 20:39.646
Well, it's not supposed to.

20:39.670 --> 20:41.106
Poems don't have
to rhyme, Claud.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.524
Well, they don't have to, but...

20:42.548 --> 20:45.350
The first letter of each line
spells out my name. See?

20:46.385 --> 20:47.654
I don't get this.

20:47.678 --> 20:49.855
What does this stuff mean about?

20:50.139 --> 20:52.200
"Discovering for the first time

20:52.224 --> 20:54.526
"that something you
always knew was there."

20:55.519 --> 20:57.446
That makes no sense.

20:58.689 --> 21:00.491
Never mind.

21:03.694 --> 21:06.047
<i>♪ Charlie's gonna buy
you a mockingbird ♪</i>

21:06.071 --> 21:09.333
<i>♪ And if that
Mockingbird don't... ♪</i>

21:09.950 --> 21:11.428
<i>♪ Mock ♪</i>

21:11.452 --> 21:13.346
<i>♪ Charlie's gonna buy you ♪</i>

21:13.370 --> 21:16.141
<i>♪ A shoe and a sock ♪</i>

21:16.165 --> 21:17.559
<i>Oh, come on. I have some stuff</i>

21:17.583 --> 21:18.810
<i>I really want to do right now.</i>

21:18.834 --> 21:20.103
<i>Could you please
just stop crying?</i>

21:20.127 --> 21:21.720
<i>For, like, 10 minutes?</i>

21:22.213 --> 21:23.764
<i>I'll rush.</i>

21:24.882 --> 21:26.026
<i>Look, it's up to you.</i>

21:26.050 --> 21:28.352
<i>If you don't want to stop,
there's nothing I can do.</i>

21:29.553 --> 21:31.063
<i>Fine.</i>

21:35.517 --> 21:37.819
Just needs to cry himself out.

21:42.566 --> 21:45.452
<i>Oh, it's okay, sweetheart.</i>

21:52.743 --> 21:54.221
<i>That's a good boy.</i>

21:54.245 --> 21:55.837
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:58.415 --> 22:00.259
He just cried himself out.

22:03.629 --> 22:05.190
I'm not good at this.

22:05.214 --> 22:07.099
Oh, it takes time.

22:07.341 --> 22:09.935
You'll relax. He'll relax.

22:10.177 --> 22:11.812
That's not the point.

22:12.179 --> 22:14.606
The point is, I do a
lot for him, okay?

22:15.474 --> 22:18.402
I do what I can, and
he's taken care of.

22:19.645 --> 22:20.872
So I'm not a great father.

22:20.896 --> 22:22.739
I didn't exactly ask to be one.

22:24.149 --> 22:25.659
I know.

22:29.279 --> 22:31.873
Yes. I'm trying to
reach Nurse Holbrook.

22:33.325 --> 22:34.552
Oh.

22:34.576 --> 22:37.254
Um, could you tell me
when her shift starts?

22:39.206 --> 22:40.850
No, no. It's not
about a patient.

22:40.874 --> 22:42.759
It's personal.

22:44.628 --> 22:46.815
Uh, no, no, no. I'd rather
not call her at home.

22:46.839 --> 22:49.433
Could I just leave a
message for her with you?

22:50.467 --> 22:51.778
Okay, could you...

22:51.802 --> 22:53.937
Could you let her know that
Bailey Salinger called?

22:55.222 --> 22:59.484
And my number is 555-7824.

23:01.186 --> 23:02.789
Two-four.

23:02.813 --> 23:05.041
Yes, it's really important
that I talk to her.

23:05.065 --> 23:07.826
It's about her daughter, Jill.

23:08.652 --> 23:10.422
No, she can call whenever.

23:10.446 --> 23:12.831
I'll be up. No time's too late.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.895
Hi. I'm looking for
Nurse Holbrook.

23:25.919 --> 23:27.262
Can you tell me...

23:28.505 --> 23:29.774
Are you...

23:29.798 --> 23:31.516
I'm... I'm Bailey Salinger.

23:32.342 --> 23:34.029
Vera. Thank you.

23:34.053 --> 23:34.946
I, uh...

23:34.970 --> 23:37.449
I left you a message for you.
I don't know if you got it.

23:37.473 --> 23:38.575
Yes, I got it.

23:38.599 --> 23:39.701
You did?

23:39.725 --> 23:41.651
Because you... you
didn't call me back.

23:42.436 --> 23:43.747
I mean, I waited

23:43.771 --> 23:45.697
all night to hear from you.

23:47.274 --> 23:49.117
I need to talk to
you about Jill.

23:55.157 --> 23:58.085
I... I don't really know what to say.
I don't...

23:58.285 --> 24:00.545
I don't know how to get
into this with you.

24:00.871 --> 24:02.724
I mean... I mean,
it's weird, you know,

24:02.748 --> 24:05.050
that we... we
haven't even met...

24:05.125 --> 24:06.895
after all this time.

24:06.919 --> 24:08.553
Why would we have met?

24:09.171 --> 24:10.806
What do you mean? Because...

24:11.840 --> 24:13.151
your daughter and I have been

24:13.175 --> 24:16.103
seeing each other for the past
couple of months, that's why.

24:20.349 --> 24:22.359
You don't know who I am, do you?

24:22.518 --> 24:24.829
When I called Jill to ask
her about that message,

24:24.853 --> 24:26.414
she said you were just
some kid from school

24:26.438 --> 24:27.540
who's been harassing her ever

24:27.564 --> 24:28.792
since she turned you
down for a date.

24:28.816 --> 24:29.834
What?

24:29.858 --> 24:31.660
Why are you making
trouble for her, huh?

24:31.777 --> 24:33.046
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

24:33.070 --> 24:34.297
She's not interested
in you, okay?

24:34.321 --> 24:36.466
We're involved. We've
been involved.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.542
I don't know why
she'd lie to you.

24:39.868 --> 24:41.429
Unless it was because
she's afraid

24:41.453 --> 24:42.921
that I was going to tell you.

24:43.914 --> 24:45.465
She's on drugs.

24:45.707 --> 24:47.467
You know?

24:52.965 --> 24:55.100
She told you I was gonna
say that, didn't she?

24:55.300 --> 24:56.810
You've got some nerve.

24:57.219 --> 24:59.864
Who do you think you are,
leaving cryptic messages,

24:59.888 --> 25:01.157
-dropping in -You...

25:01.181 --> 25:02.117
at my place of work,

25:02.141 --> 25:03.993
pretending like you know a
damn about my daughter?

25:04.017 --> 25:05.245
- Ms. Holbrook...
- What, do you think

25:05.269 --> 25:06.746
you're gonna get away
with make up stories?

25:06.770 --> 25:08.540
Like I wouldn't know
if she was on drugs?

25:08.564 --> 25:11.000
I'm a nurse. I see that kind
of thing every single day.

25:11.024 --> 25:13.201
Well, you're missing it, then,
because she's in trouble.

25:13.443 --> 25:14.504
She needs help.

25:14.528 --> 25:15.954
You listen to me.

25:16.155 --> 25:19.666
You either turn around and walk
away right now or I call security.

25:20.075 --> 25:21.710
Your choice.

25:26.206 --> 25:29.718
I'd like to meet the genius who
said gardening reduces stress.

25:30.669 --> 25:32.637
I think Justin's
still in the shower,

25:32.754 --> 25:35.066
and I suspect from
my last water bill,

25:35.090 --> 25:37.392
he's gonna be at least
another 10 minutes.

25:37.593 --> 25:38.820
Can you hear him?

25:38.844 --> 25:40.071
Showering?

25:40.095 --> 25:42.240
Singing. He didn't used to.

25:42.264 --> 25:43.908
Only since you.

25:43.932 --> 25:46.026
He sings? Justin? Really?

25:47.644 --> 25:49.372
Oh. God, I'm blushing.

25:49.396 --> 25:51.332
I probably look like
a total idiot, huh?

25:51.356 --> 25:53.867
No, you don't. You look happy.

25:54.318 --> 25:55.795
So how did it happen?

25:55.819 --> 25:58.038
- Us getting together?
- Yeah.

25:58.322 --> 26:00.300
Well, I kept catching
him watching me

26:00.324 --> 26:02.343
in the rear view mirror
in Drivers' Ed class,

26:02.367 --> 26:05.921
and at first, he kept looking
away like it didn't happen.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.640
Oh, you don't want to hear this.

26:07.664 --> 26:09.674
Are you kidding me?
Of course I do.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.937
Well, eventually, we started
meeting each other's eyes

26:12.961 --> 26:14.638
and not looking away,

26:15.088 --> 26:16.723
and then he kissed me.

26:17.633 --> 26:18.818
Once after class,

26:18.842 --> 26:20.778
once in the dark room
during an aftershock.

26:20.802 --> 26:22.938
Isn't that just so...

26:23.013 --> 26:24.356
Romantic?

26:24.681 --> 26:27.484
Yeah. Mm. He's a good kisser.

26:27.851 --> 26:30.121
You really don't want to
hear about stuff like that,

26:30.145 --> 26:31.289
I mean, being a mom.

26:31.313 --> 26:33.240
Oh, absolutely not.

26:33.523 --> 26:35.575
come on.

26:36.193 --> 26:39.464
Well, he keeps his eyes closed
for a long time after it's over,

26:39.488 --> 26:41.299
like he's still
thinking about it.

26:41.323 --> 26:42.675
Isn't that, uh...

26:42.699 --> 26:44.167
Adorable?

26:44.243 --> 26:46.554
Yeah, and he does stuff,

26:46.578 --> 26:49.224
like, he drew this sketch
of me in English class.

26:49.248 --> 26:50.966
Really? He sketches?

26:51.041 --> 26:53.311
And he wrote this poem using
the letters of my name.

26:53.335 --> 26:55.063
It's got this
beautiful line in it.

26:55.087 --> 26:56.388
It goes...

26:56.672 --> 26:57.899
It goes something...

26:57.923 --> 26:59.266
I can't...

27:05.639 --> 27:07.315
You want to read it?

27:09.184 --> 27:10.610
Yeah.

27:17.442 --> 27:19.119
I'm gonna take my break now.

27:20.153 --> 27:22.006
Kind of an all-purpose
story, huh, Jill?

27:22.030 --> 27:23.258
You want to tell me, Jill?

27:23.282 --> 27:24.717
Who else has got it
in for you besides me

27:24.741 --> 27:25.677
and that parking-lot guy?

27:25.701 --> 27:27.262
I have nothing to say to you.
Just leave me alone.

27:27.286 --> 27:28.596
You really want that? Huh?

27:28.620 --> 27:30.515
Last week you begged
me not to walk out.

27:30.539 --> 27:33.059
You begged me to help, and
that's what I'm trying to do.

27:33.083 --> 27:35.061
By going to my mother!
My mother!

27:35.085 --> 27:37.188
You could've killed
yourself in that car.

27:37.212 --> 27:38.856
Maybe next time that's
what's gonna happen,

27:38.880 --> 27:41.067
unless you get yourself some
help, so yeah, I went to her.

27:41.091 --> 27:43.611
Now you're acting all moral like
it was the right thing to do.

27:43.635 --> 27:46.030
- You go to her behind my back.
- You beat me to it.

27:46.054 --> 27:48.241
That's right, because you would
have told her all that stuff,

27:48.265 --> 27:50.326
and like she and I could ever
have a relationship again.

27:50.350 --> 27:51.786
Like you have a
relationship now.

27:51.810 --> 27:53.528
She didn't have clue who I was.

27:53.645 --> 27:55.373
You gonna tell me you
guys are best friends?

27:55.397 --> 27:58.835
No! No, we are not friends.
We are not much of anything.

27:58.859 --> 28:01.504
The last thing that I need is for
her to be smelling my breath

28:01.528 --> 28:04.048
and be checking my pupils,
locking me in till I'm 18.

28:04.072 --> 28:07.260
- Jill...
- You don't get it, Bailey.

28:07.284 --> 28:09.127
I can't trust you.

28:10.495 --> 28:11.931
You can't trust me?

28:11.955 --> 28:13.141
What is that? A joke?

28:13.165 --> 28:15.216
Yeah. It's a riot.

28:15.751 --> 28:18.021
I can't tell you, Bailey,
how much I'm enjoying this.

28:18.045 --> 28:20.023
Gee, what lovely surprises

28:20.047 --> 28:21.566
have you in store
for me next, huh?

28:21.590 --> 28:23.767
Jill... you need help.

28:25.385 --> 28:27.437
We used to have fun.

28:28.263 --> 28:29.731
Remember that?

28:30.599 --> 28:32.484
Now all we're about is this.

28:33.435 --> 28:35.455
Well, I don't need it.

28:35.479 --> 28:37.322
You can go to hell.

28:45.072 --> 28:47.216
I guess you might as well
relax until Artie gets here.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.458
What's going on?

28:49.409 --> 28:50.720
Hey, maybe Artie forgot.

28:50.744 --> 28:52.889
- I could ask you the same thing.
- I got a message.

28:52.913 --> 28:55.224
He asked me to meet him here
so we could go home together.

28:55.248 --> 28:56.768
I walked over from the office.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.551
I got the same message.

29:05.967 --> 29:07.987
Start serving. Now.

29:08.011 --> 29:10.281
Claud, I told you. I don't
want any part of this.

29:10.305 --> 29:12.232
I think it's a lousy idea.

29:12.891 --> 29:16.236
How many of your ex-girlfriends
does Kirsten know about?

29:18.897 --> 29:21.282
I'll start with
the Caesar salad.

29:21.608 --> 29:23.544
I don't get this. Why
would he call both of us?

29:23.568 --> 29:25.495
Maybe he thought
you wouldn't come.

29:27.030 --> 29:29.833
Can we not do this?

29:30.158 --> 29:31.501
Huh?

29:36.331 --> 29:37.433
Did you call about the guy about

29:37.457 --> 29:38.685
fixing the drapes
in the living room?

29:38.709 --> 29:40.468
Yes. He's coming Tuesday.

29:41.086 --> 29:43.439
Oh, and I canceled the
Orbachs for Saturday night.

29:43.463 --> 29:44.440
If you want the ticket...

29:44.464 --> 29:45.598
No.

29:51.763 --> 29:53.356
Do you mind if I read?

29:53.974 --> 29:55.525
Why would I?

29:57.477 --> 29:58.913
If you have any requests...

29:58.937 --> 30:00.530
Could you stop,

30:00.731 --> 30:02.115
sweetie?

30:03.066 --> 30:04.711
Actually, you know,
I'm going to go.

30:04.735 --> 30:06.995
I've got some calls to
make back at the office.

30:07.195 --> 30:09.122
Could you tell Artie I waited?

30:09.448 --> 30:12.083
And what time can I
expect you home?

30:12.784 --> 30:14.294
Late.

30:21.126 --> 30:22.395
Owen...

30:22.419 --> 30:24.012
Come on.

30:24.463 --> 30:26.139
Give me a break here.

30:26.882 --> 30:29.142
What's not working about
this for you, huh?

30:30.927 --> 30:33.364
Since when does meal time
have to be fun, anyway?

30:33.388 --> 30:34.323
You don't see me playing

30:34.347 --> 30:36.367
"I'm a little airplane"
when I'm eating, do you?

30:36.391 --> 30:37.609
Come on.

30:39.186 --> 30:40.945
Okay. That's it. You're done.

30:40.979 --> 30:42.081
What do you say
we try this again

30:42.105 --> 30:43.573
when you're a little older, huh?

30:43.648 --> 30:45.283
- Like 9.
- Di-da.

30:45.442 --> 30:46.910
Dada.

30:48.904 --> 30:50.830
Kirsten! Kirsten!

30:51.448 --> 30:53.176
Charlie, what?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.927
He just... He just...

30:54.951 --> 30:56.637
Did he spit up again or something?
What?

30:56.661 --> 30:57.597
Dada.

30:57.621 --> 30:58.639
- Dada.
- That!

30:58.663 --> 31:01.007
Oh. Oh!

31:07.088 --> 31:08.765
Oh! Mwah!

31:08.840 --> 31:10.809
Come in.

31:12.302 --> 31:14.187
Hey, I called you twice.

31:14.346 --> 31:16.397
Do you know what the
word "private" means?

31:16.807 --> 31:18.108
Do you?

31:18.266 --> 31:19.327
Justin...

31:19.351 --> 31:21.037
You showed that
poem to my mother.

31:21.061 --> 31:22.445
No, I...

31:23.063 --> 31:24.280
She told you?

31:24.940 --> 31:26.542
That was between us.

31:26.566 --> 31:28.628
That was, like, the most
private thing I could do,

31:28.652 --> 31:30.129
and you showed it to my mother.

31:30.153 --> 31:31.579
I didn't think, uh...

31:32.113 --> 31:33.216
I'm sorry.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.959
Do you, like, tell her
everything I say to you?

31:36.117 --> 31:38.721
Do you... tell her what
it's like when I kiss you?

31:38.745 --> 31:40.181
No! Of course not.

31:40.205 --> 31:42.225
What do you mean,
"Of course not"?

31:42.249 --> 31:43.476
I mean, it's not like
it's impossible.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.717
Look what you did.

31:45.335 --> 31:47.262
I wrote you a love poem.

31:47.629 --> 31:48.648
I mean, that's the first...

31:48.672 --> 31:51.391
That's the only love poem
I've ever written anyone.

31:52.342 --> 31:53.861
I couldn't even say those
things to your face.

31:53.885 --> 31:55.270
I had to write them down.

31:56.721 --> 31:58.231
I'm sorry.

31:58.431 --> 31:59.534
Where is it?

31:59.558 --> 32:01.025
Where's the... the poem?

32:02.018 --> 32:04.070
It's on the, um...

32:08.441 --> 32:11.369
Justin, please don't do that.
Please.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.247
I never should've
written this for you.

32:23.874 --> 32:26.092
I almost had it memorized.

32:28.253 --> 32:29.480
You had that friend...

32:29.504 --> 32:31.107
that guy in the...

32:31.131 --> 32:32.515
Who had a coke problem.

32:32.966 --> 32:34.277
Gary.

32:34.301 --> 32:36.863
Right. So what did you do?

32:36.887 --> 32:38.197
Was there, like,

32:38.221 --> 32:39.866
some really low-key treatment
program somewhere?

32:39.890 --> 32:41.117
Because maybe...

32:41.141 --> 32:42.901
if you talk to her mother...

32:43.101 --> 32:44.370
You know, I mean, I tried,

32:44.394 --> 32:45.538
and it, like,
completely backfired,

32:45.562 --> 32:47.572
but you're older, so maybe...

32:47.606 --> 32:48.749
Bailey, I'm not...

32:48.773 --> 32:51.701
Please, Charlie. I'm asking you.

32:53.778 --> 32:55.330
I'm asking you.

32:55.947 --> 32:58.166
I'm really scared of what
could happen to her.

33:00.952 --> 33:03.546
Bay, what are you gonna do?

33:04.873 --> 33:07.592
You keep drawing a line,
and she keeps crossing it,

33:07.792 --> 33:09.228
and you keep going back to her,

33:09.252 --> 33:10.595
which is only making
things worse.

33:12.756 --> 33:15.725
I'm telling you, the best thing
you can do is walk away.

33:20.639 --> 33:22.857
I should've known better
than to come to you.

33:23.016 --> 33:24.525
What the hell does that mean?

33:25.018 --> 33:27.204
It means you've got one
answer to every problem.

33:27.228 --> 33:28.956
Turn your back and walk away.

33:28.980 --> 33:30.499
I am not walking away.

33:30.523 --> 33:32.084
- Yeah, you are.
- No!

33:32.108 --> 33:34.128
I'm not walking away from
you, and you're my problem.

33:34.152 --> 33:35.588
You're my responsibility.

33:35.612 --> 33:36.996
Please.

33:37.030 --> 33:38.581
Why don't you listen to me?

33:39.824 --> 33:41.177
I don't want to find
out you're in the car

33:41.201 --> 33:42.511
the next time she cracks it up.

33:42.535 --> 33:45.630
I don't want you in trouble with
the police if she gets busted.

33:46.331 --> 33:49.384
I don't want you getting deeper
and deeper into this with her.

33:52.963 --> 33:54.555
I don't have a choice.

33:56.675 --> 33:58.059
Bailey...

33:58.343 --> 33:59.737
what is going on here?

33:59.761 --> 34:01.187
What...

34:01.346 --> 34:02.814
Are you in love with her?

34:23.201 --> 34:26.295
Hey! Hey! Hi!

34:32.377 --> 34:33.896
Have you seen Jill?
Has she been in?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.471
No, sorry.

34:38.675 --> 34:40.569
- Hey, man.
- Talking to me?

34:40.592 --> 34:42.321
- Yeah.
- Oh, you.

34:42.344 --> 34:44.063
Hey, you got cash
on you this time?

34:44.179 --> 34:45.815
Do I what?

34:46.266 --> 34:48.284
Because like I told you the other
day, I don't believe in credit.

34:48.309 --> 34:51.288
No. No, I'm not, uh...
I'm looking for someone.

34:51.312 --> 34:52.989
For Jill. Have you seen her?

34:53.523 --> 34:55.241
Why do you want to know?

34:55.400 --> 34:56.784
Because...

34:57.402 --> 34:59.005
she was buying
some stuff for me,

34:59.029 --> 35:00.288
and, uh...

35:00.321 --> 35:02.290
and I think she may
have split with it.

35:02.365 --> 35:03.926
Yeah, she burned you, man.

35:03.950 --> 35:06.512
She said something about going
to check the scene down in L.A.

35:06.536 --> 35:07.972
and that was, like, yesterday.

35:07.996 --> 35:09.672
She's probably long gone by now.

35:24.345 --> 35:25.813
Do you mind?

35:25.847 --> 35:28.900
Um... I'm studying right now.

35:29.851 --> 35:31.652
Come on, Justin.

35:31.978 --> 35:33.581
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

35:33.605 --> 35:36.157
I should never have shown
your poem to anyone else.

35:36.983 --> 35:38.993
Least of all, my mother.

35:39.402 --> 35:40.828
Right.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.259
Look, I want you to understand
what you did for me.

35:45.283 --> 35:48.836
I mean, that poem, it
was so incredible,

35:49.162 --> 35:50.556
and it's gonna sound weird,

35:50.580 --> 35:53.142
but it's like seeing a movie
or going on vacation.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.051
It's better when you share it.

35:55.919 --> 35:57.595
Well, you have me.

35:58.588 --> 36:00.431
That's not what I mean.

36:01.382 --> 36:02.610
When we were in seventh grade,

36:02.634 --> 36:05.103
I had a crush on Brian Gleason.

36:06.763 --> 36:08.564
No accounting for taste, huh?

36:08.973 --> 36:10.284
But every day, I would go home

36:10.308 --> 36:11.911
and I would tell my mom
what had happened,

36:11.935 --> 36:13.079
which was pretty much nothing,

36:13.103 --> 36:14.570
because Brian didn't
know I existed.

36:15.188 --> 36:18.417
But she promised me that someday
something would happen,

36:18.441 --> 36:20.076
and we made a pact...

36:20.193 --> 36:21.953
that I would tell
her everything.

36:22.028 --> 36:23.756
First kiss, first...

36:23.780 --> 36:25.623
everything. First poem.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.593
- Julia...
- It's not sad.

36:27.617 --> 36:29.585
Justin, it's great.

36:30.036 --> 36:31.379
You're great.

36:33.039 --> 36:36.259
It's just that one part of
it, not telling someone.

36:37.210 --> 36:40.022
I want to be able to go home
and sit on my bed with someone

36:40.046 --> 36:41.190
and say,

36:41.214 --> 36:42.890
"Guess what Justin did today?"

36:44.092 --> 36:45.528
Or, "You wouldn't believe the

36:45.552 --> 36:47.937
way he looked at
me in math class."

36:48.179 --> 36:52.159
Or, "Look at this incredibly
wonderful thing that he wrote.

36:52.183 --> 36:53.702
"What do you think it means?

36:53.726 --> 36:55.445
"Do you think it means
that maybe he's...

36:55.979 --> 36:58.364
Maybe he's falling
in love with me?"

36:59.440 --> 37:01.033
Yes.

37:11.035 --> 37:13.097
So, I was figuring.

37:13.121 --> 37:14.932
Maybe I could take some
of my bar-mitzvah money

37:14.956 --> 37:17.300
and send them to
Hawaii or something.

37:17.625 --> 37:19.343
Don't you think
that's a good idea?

37:23.882 --> 37:25.433
A while ago,

37:25.675 --> 37:28.019
I guess about 11 months ago,

37:28.344 --> 37:30.271
I was having trouble sleeping.

37:30.555 --> 37:33.316
I was sleepwalking, and
I didn't even know it,

37:33.516 --> 37:35.276
which is pretty creepy.

37:35.435 --> 37:38.205
Every night, I'd walk downstairs
and I'd open the front door

37:38.229 --> 37:40.448
and I'd just stand
in the doorway.

37:40.857 --> 37:42.116
Just stand there,

37:42.609 --> 37:45.087
like I was waiting for someone
to come up the steps.

37:45.111 --> 37:47.381
Then Bailey or Julia would
have to get out of bed

37:47.405 --> 37:49.425
and come and get me and
bring me back to bed.

37:49.449 --> 37:50.467
Yeah,

37:50.491 --> 37:53.753
so what's that got to do with
my parents going to Hawaii?

37:55.246 --> 37:56.631
The thing is...

37:56.873 --> 37:59.425
Well, after a while...

37:59.500 --> 38:01.135
I stopped sleepwalking,

38:01.669 --> 38:05.056
and I stopped going
to the front door

38:05.465 --> 38:07.683
and I started to sleep
through the night.

38:08.635 --> 38:09.862
Claudia...

38:09.886 --> 38:12.855
At some point, you stop expecting
things o be different.

38:13.932 --> 38:14.950
You know?

38:14.974 --> 38:15.993
What?

38:16.017 --> 38:17.318
You just...

38:19.145 --> 38:20.696
You sort of accept things.

38:22.899 --> 38:24.534
I don't get it.

38:24.651 --> 38:26.670
You were the one who said
we should try and do stuff

38:26.694 --> 38:28.088
to get my mom and
dad back together.

38:28.112 --> 38:30.716
I know. That was dumb.

38:30.740 --> 38:31.967
Oh, great.

38:31.991 --> 38:33.719
- Sorry, Artie.
- Forget it.

38:33.743 --> 38:35.095
You don't understand anything.

38:35.119 --> 38:37.880
Come on, Artie. You know I do.

38:41.042 --> 38:43.052
The hard stuff.

38:44.587 --> 38:46.430
Gets easier.

38:48.299 --> 38:49.976
Promise.

38:57.684 --> 39:00.069
I thought maybe I'd
walk you home.

39:00.937 --> 39:02.831
And you'd gotten hold of
these laundry markers,

39:02.855 --> 39:04.333
red and black.

39:04.357 --> 39:06.210
I've actually seen
pictures of this.

39:06.234 --> 39:07.169
Seen what?

39:07.193 --> 39:10.204
You guys were four, maybe five.

39:10.405 --> 39:11.799
You guys were playing dress-up,

39:11.823 --> 39:13.133
and you gave Justin

39:13.157 --> 39:15.261
this black beard and a mustache

39:15.285 --> 39:17.596
and you gave yourself
this rouge and lipstick

39:17.620 --> 39:18.931
in indelible ink.

39:18.955 --> 39:20.266
Oh, my God.

39:20.290 --> 39:21.684
We couldn't get that stuff off.

39:21.708 --> 39:23.269
We were scrubbing

39:23.293 --> 39:24.395
and you were crying...

39:24.419 --> 39:25.479
We went to school like that?

39:25.503 --> 39:26.730
For an entire month.

39:26.754 --> 39:29.108
Your mom and I finally had to
take you to a dermatologist

39:29.132 --> 39:30.276
to get that stuff off.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.653
God, I don't remember this.

39:32.677 --> 39:35.896
Really? I think I've heard
it about 200,000 times.

39:36.556 --> 39:37.982
Anyway...

39:38.808 --> 39:41.694
Well, there must be a million
stories about the two of you.

39:42.061 --> 39:43.789
And I know, I know,

39:43.813 --> 39:45.499
you've heard them
too many times.

39:45.523 --> 39:48.034
No. I think I'm going to go.

39:48.359 --> 39:50.161
Oh, wait. Don't, um...

39:50.611 --> 39:52.923
You know what? We
should probably study.

39:52.947 --> 39:54.341
I'm sorry. I'll leave you alone.

39:54.365 --> 39:55.467
Oh, no, no, no.

39:55.491 --> 39:57.386
It's all right. I'm just tired.

39:57.410 --> 39:58.554
I want to, uh...

39:58.578 --> 39:59.972
I'm gonna go hit the hay.

39:59.996 --> 40:01.432
Oh, okay. I'll go.

40:01.456 --> 40:04.467
No. Stay. I'm serious.

40:04.709 --> 40:06.427
Both of you.

40:07.086 --> 40:08.512
All right?

40:08.588 --> 40:09.930
Good night.

40:10.673 --> 40:12.516
Good night.

40:16.721 --> 40:19.565
Tell her that one about us
at the tide pools together.

40:20.058 --> 40:21.609
It's a good one.

40:23.019 --> 40:24.820
Good night, honey.

40:37.700 --> 40:38.886
Mrs. Holbrook.

40:38.910 --> 40:41.087
Is she here? My daughter.

40:41.913 --> 40:43.432
No.

40:43.456 --> 40:45.257
She didn't come home last night.

40:46.042 --> 40:48.645
I didn't realize because by the
time I get home from work,

40:48.669 --> 40:50.096
she's usually gone,

40:50.296 --> 40:51.398
but there's...

40:51.422 --> 40:55.017
this duffel bag we keep
in the hall closet,

40:55.385 --> 40:56.695
and it's gone.

40:56.719 --> 40:58.396
She's gone, I think.

40:59.389 --> 41:01.315
Do you know?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.944
I heard she might've
gone down to L.A.

41:06.896 --> 41:08.280
No.

41:10.024 --> 41:11.909
Oh, no.

41:13.778 --> 41:15.538
Is it bad?

41:15.905 --> 41:17.248
The drugs?

41:17.365 --> 41:19.208
Is she in trouble?

41:19.409 --> 41:21.168
I don't know.

41:22.620 --> 41:25.089
I think she wants to
stop, but I don't think

41:25.498 --> 41:27.341
that she knows how to.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.343
Not by herself.

41:29.877 --> 41:31.429
So you came to me.

41:32.505 --> 41:35.067
You were worried and
you came to me,

41:35.091 --> 41:36.851
and I didn't believe you.

41:38.010 --> 41:39.437
I'm sorry.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.857
I should've seen
it in your face.

41:45.726 --> 41:47.162
It's hard, you know?

41:47.186 --> 41:49.957
You work so hard to put food
on the table for the kids,

41:49.981 --> 41:52.366
and then you're never
around to eat it with them.

41:53.359 --> 41:56.579
Everything just. It all
passes by in a blur.

41:56.821 --> 41:58.289
The D-minus,

41:58.322 --> 41:59.957
her ankle tattoo,

41:59.991 --> 42:01.834
the broken curfew.

42:02.785 --> 42:04.346
And, you know,

42:04.370 --> 42:05.848
you think about it, you know,

42:05.872 --> 42:07.975
in the car on the
way to work, and...

42:07.999 --> 42:10.009
and you mean to say something.

42:10.084 --> 42:12.553
You know, you mean
to take the time,

42:13.463 --> 42:15.514
but then you get home and...

42:17.258 --> 42:19.393
It gets lost.

42:23.556 --> 42:25.775
She got lost.

42:28.853 --> 42:30.905
I lost her somewhere.

42:32.273 --> 42:34.700
I didn't mean to.

42:35.109 --> 42:37.578
I don't know who my daughter is.

42:43.993 --> 42:46.003
Can you tell me about her?

42:48.956 --> 42:50.925
Why don't you come inside?

43:00.343 --> 43:02.311
Charlie?

43:04.764 --> 43:07.743
And after her concert, the
princess went to a party

43:07.767 --> 43:09.077
given in her honor,

43:09.101 --> 43:10.787
but she got tired of
all the compliments

43:10.811 --> 43:12.581
about her violin playing,

43:12.605 --> 43:14.833
and she wandered back
into the kitchen.

43:14.857 --> 43:16.877
And in the corner
was a young man

43:16.901 --> 43:18.670
sorting through a
huge bin of lettuce

43:18.694 --> 43:20.788
with a panicked
look on his face.

43:21.072 --> 43:22.873
She said, "What are you doing?"

43:23.074 --> 43:25.010
He said, "Well, I lost
a Band-Aid in here,

43:25.034 --> 43:26.011
and if I don't find it,

43:26.035 --> 43:27.753
it's gonna end up in
someone's salad."

43:28.120 --> 43:29.223
The princess smiled,

43:29.247 --> 43:30.891
and she took pity
on the young man,

43:30.915 --> 43:32.226
and together, they set out

43:32.250 --> 43:34.061
to find the missing Band-Aid

43:34.085 --> 43:35.812
and save the man
from a grim fate.

43:35.836 --> 43:38.357
And as they hunted,

43:38.381 --> 43:39.858
it suddenly occurred
to the young man

43:39.882 --> 43:41.276
that this princess,

43:41.300 --> 43:43.028
elbow-deep in Belgian endive,

43:43.052 --> 43:46.532
was the most beautiful
woman that he'd ever seen,

43:46.556 --> 43:49.066
and at that exact same moment,

43:49.308 --> 43:51.078
it occurred to the princess

43:51.102 --> 43:53.863
that she'd never seen
eyes as blue as his,

43:54.855 --> 43:57.709
and she began to wonder
if maybe this young man

43:57.733 --> 44:00.327
wasn't really a
prince in disguise,

44:00.695 --> 44:02.538
and she said to him,

44:03.239 --> 44:05.624
"How do you feel about kids?"

44:05.866 --> 44:07.710
And he said,

44:07.910 --> 44:10.337
"Well, I've always wanted
to have five of them."
