WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:02.868
(dramatic music)

00:02.970 --> 00:04.870
- This house is
my childhood home.

00:04.972 --> 00:08.073
I probably have around
10,000 books, if not more.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.376
- After I've saw the
conditions of the house,

00:10.478 --> 00:13.078
it's just a challenge
to help her survive.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.749
- I'm noticing there are
cracks along the ceiling.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.018
- [Cory] I have quite a few
concerns; it's a little scary.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.053
- Oh my gosh, this
has totally failed.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.856
- If this structural
engineer comes out

00:23.958 --> 00:25.357
and deems this house unsafe,

00:25.459 --> 00:27.626
this whole cleanup is
gonna get shut down.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.696
- [Becky] It's my family's
heirlooms! (weeping)

00:30.798 --> 00:31.964
I can't do it.

00:33.601 --> 00:34.967
- [Cory] That is a lotta weight

00:35.069 --> 00:36.802
that could come crumbling
down at any minute.

00:38.806 --> 00:39.805
- That's so useful.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.440
Why am I throwing that away?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.209
- The biggest challenge
will be letting go.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.779
I've tried, really did.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.817
(soft pensive music)

01:25.820 --> 01:28.020
(dramatic music)

01:31.258 --> 01:32.891
(Tiffany groaning)

01:32.993 --> 01:34.626
- I'm Tiffany and I'm a hoarder.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.865
This house is 2,300 square feet.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.472
It is my childhood home.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.074
I grew up here with my parents,

01:49.176 --> 01:51.276
my grandmother, and my sister.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.984
The entire house has, over
the years, been filled

01:59.086 --> 02:01.019
with my mom and my
father's hoarding

02:02.323 --> 02:03.956
and then my hoarding also.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.062
I started off after college
working at a bookstore

02:11.165 --> 02:13.999
and the employee
discount was pretty good,

02:14.101 --> 02:19.104
so that's when I wanted
to buy so many books,

02:19.773 --> 02:20.439
'cause I enjoy them.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.242
It was fabulous.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.246
I probably have around
10,000 books, if not more.

02:28.516 --> 02:32.851
The magazines that I
purchased for 20 years

02:32.953 --> 02:37.089
and probably about 20 magazines

02:37.191 --> 02:39.324
each month or every other month.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.397
I like to hoard art supplies,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.600
craft supplies,

02:48.702 --> 02:50.335
old antiques,

02:51.372 --> 02:52.738
clocks.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.940
Anything that gives
me inspiration

02:56.377 --> 02:59.211
could be up for grabs, as far
as the hoarding is concerned.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.417
- I'm Becky and I'm
Tiffany's younger sister.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.585
(slow emotional music)

03:06.687 --> 03:10.455
Tiffany lived with my
parents for her whole life.

03:10.558 --> 03:15.327
She doesn't know what it's
like to live independently

03:15.429 --> 03:18.063
or even live in
a different home.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.934
She's only moved from one room

03:23.771 --> 03:27.873
to the other room when
the one room got too full.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.876
She's never moved more
than a bedroom away.

03:32.713 --> 03:37.449
Both of my parents liked
collecting a lot of things.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.053
My mom liked to
collect glassware,

03:41.155 --> 03:42.454
antiques,

03:43.457 --> 03:45.991
crafting supplies,

03:46.093 --> 03:48.760
art supplies, sewing supplies.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.597
The list is almost endless.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.270
My dad, he could fix
just about anything,

03:59.540 --> 04:02.674
and so he had plumbing
supplies, electric supplies,

04:03.844 --> 04:07.246
extra vacuum cleaners to
fix the vacuum cleaners,

04:08.682 --> 04:11.216
a dozen lawn mowers
to fix the lawn mower.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.986
He loved cars.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.888
His favorite car was a Corvette.

04:18.092 --> 04:21.560
One of them is still in the
garage that I hope to keep,

04:22.563 --> 04:24.563
provided we can
find all the parts.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.365
The garage is
filled with pieces.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.367
The basement is
filled with pieces.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.669
There's just a lotta stuff.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.575
Growing up, Tiffany
and I were close.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.677
We are only two years apart,

04:38.779 --> 04:42.648
so we did a lot of things
together, as sisters would do.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.917
And then again with the
crafts and the sewing

04:46.020 --> 04:49.488
and the things that my
family was interested in,

04:49.590 --> 04:51.290
we did those as a family

04:51.392 --> 04:54.526
and we had a lot
of other activities

04:54.628 --> 04:57.296
surrounding, like the
Little People of America,

04:57.398 --> 05:00.599
that organization that we
were very involved with

05:00.701 --> 05:02.668
growing up, for my sister.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.538
- I am an achondroplastic dwarf,

05:06.640 --> 05:10.809
which means that I have
shorter legs and arms

05:10.911 --> 05:15.914
and my spine area is the
same as average people.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.784
I'm only four feet tall.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.887
- Tiffany is a little person,

05:21.989 --> 05:25.624
and that brings a
lot of challenges.

05:25.726 --> 05:29.328
So, there were stools
everywhere in the house

05:29.430 --> 05:34.199
and things that she needed
to be low on the countertops

05:34.301 --> 05:38.804
and even pushed forward
because her arms are shorter

05:38.906 --> 05:41.373
that she can't even reach
the back of the countertop,

05:41.475 --> 05:45.911
so it presented challenges
in everyday life.

05:47.881 --> 05:52.250
My grandmother lived there
until she passed away.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.222
So, both my grandmother,
mother, and myself

05:57.324 --> 06:01.526
all helped Tiffany with
her everyday activities.

06:07.401 --> 06:11.336
Me living at college and not
returning home very often

06:11.438 --> 06:13.672
definitely affected
the relationship

06:13.774 --> 06:16.074
between my sister and I.

06:16.176 --> 06:21.079
I wasn't caring for her like
I had been on a daily basis.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.948
- Once Becky moved out,

06:23.050 --> 06:24.549
we didn't see each
other that often.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.019
She very rarely
came to the house.

06:28.122 --> 06:32.090
And when she did, we would
meet her on the porch

06:32.192 --> 06:36.128
so as not to show her the
interior of the house.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.032
We also started
celebrating holidays

06:41.135 --> 06:44.436
and family get-togethers
at her place

06:44.538 --> 06:47.205
so as she wouldn't have
to come into this house

06:47.307 --> 06:48.774
and see how bad it had gotten.

06:55.249 --> 06:59.751
- My parents passed
away 10 months apart.

06:59.853 --> 07:03.021
My mom's passing was expected.

07:03.123 --> 07:07.692
She was sick with cancer
for quite a few years.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.630
My dad's passing was
completely unexpected.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.198
Our lives changed.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.468
Everything changed.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.770
(somber piano music)

07:18.872 --> 07:23.542
- Losing both my parents
within such a short time span

07:23.644 --> 07:26.278
was awful for myself
and for my sister.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.548
It was a big black
cloud above our heads.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.751
My parents were my
support system for my life

07:32.853 --> 07:36.855
and I was very close to the
both of them my whole life.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.924
I feel like an orphan.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.528
- I'm Jeff, and
Becky is my wife.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.232
After Becky and
Tiffany's parents died,

07:47.334 --> 07:50.635
that was the first time that
I've saw the house in 15 years.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.042
After I've saw the
conditions of the house,

07:57.144 --> 08:00.011
at that point, it
was very unsafe.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.247
I mean, stuff could
have fell on her,

08:02.349 --> 08:05.350
could have fell in front of the
door, she couldn't get out.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.451
There's a lotta
different reasons

08:06.553 --> 08:08.753
why she shouldn't have
stayed in the house.

08:08.856 --> 08:13.358
- We couldn't let
her live in that.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.827
(slow, dramatic music)

08:21.568 --> 08:23.735
- If I would have fallen,
I don't even know

08:23.837 --> 08:26.872
if I would have been able
to get to my phone or not.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.975
It was a real safety
concern for me,

08:30.077 --> 08:33.979
so I had to leave and
go live with my sister,

08:34.081 --> 08:36.147
her husband, and my niece.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.486
- I'm Rachel, and
I'm Tiffany's niece.

08:41.588 --> 08:44.556
Tiffany's been living with
us for almost two years now.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.924
Having Tiffany live with us

08:46.026 --> 08:48.193
has affected our
relationship a lot

08:48.295 --> 08:50.262
because before, I
would see her often,

08:50.364 --> 08:53.098
she would come over a
couple times a month,

08:53.200 --> 08:56.601
once a week, something like
that, and so we were close then.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.602
But it was nothing like now,

08:57.704 --> 09:00.105
because now we're
living with each other.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.675
And because I see her every
day, I'm actually closer to her.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.410
- Can you put this over
there for me, please?

09:05.512 --> 09:06.478
- Yeah, yeah.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.879
One of the only positive
things to me about it

09:07.981 --> 09:10.448
is that I've gotten
to know her better.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.450
- Come sit by me.
- Okay.

09:12.553 --> 09:16.154
- My daughter Rachel and
Tiffany are very close.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.522
- [Rachel] Okay.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.958
- They have a really
cool relationship.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.927
- [Tiffany] What is that outfit?

09:22.029 --> 09:28.533
- Rachel gets to know her
aunt more than most nieces do.

09:28.635 --> 09:33.538
And because my sister
lived with my parents,

09:34.341 --> 09:36.741
she really needs that bond

09:36.843 --> 09:41.413
and that person to have
and to be close with.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.882
And just because
of the situation,

09:43.984 --> 09:48.920
it is so difficult for
me to be that person.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.656
- Of course, I worry
about my mom a lot.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.992
I can see how it's
affecting her.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.627
I can see how stressed she is

09:55.729 --> 09:58.229
and how it's affecting
her mental health too.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.498
It's affecting
everybody in the house.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.733
- One of the things
that's changed

10:01.835 --> 10:03.068
is the fact that
we're taking care

10:03.170 --> 10:04.669
of a whole 'nother person.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.605
- I forgot to tell you that.
- Okay.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.574
- There's a lotta
different challenges.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.910
We have to make things
accessible for her

10:12.012 --> 10:13.945
to be able to get
around our own house.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.118
Yeah, it's just a challenge
every day to help her survive.

10:21.455 --> 10:25.724
- My relationship with my
husband, Jeff, is very strained.

10:25.826 --> 10:30.428
Having your sister live
with you is very difficult.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.932
It affects all of
our daily life.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.134
It's been a strain.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.872
- My sister and her husband
are very private people,

10:40.974 --> 10:45.110
so they're not used to having
people over at their house

10:45.212 --> 10:49.280
for long extended periods of
time, so tensions are high.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.482
It's hard.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.251
I have to get used to
their way of doing things,

10:53.353 --> 10:57.122
their lifestyle, when they
eat, when they go to bed

10:57.224 --> 11:01.226
and try to mingle my
lifestyle into that.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.262
So, it's been difficult.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.998
(pensive music)

11:14.141 --> 11:17.142
- I'm Christine, and
Tiffany and I are cousins.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.110
Tiffany and Becky's parents

11:19.212 --> 11:23.014
bought an extra home
with a lot next door

11:23.116 --> 11:24.849
with the intention
of having Becky

11:24.951 --> 11:26.651
be able to live in the home

11:26.753 --> 11:31.489
and then build a home on the
property nextdoor for Tiffany,

11:31.591 --> 11:32.791
and this way,

11:32.893 --> 11:34.626
'cause they always knew Tiffany
would need someone around.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.261
She would need a
little bit of help,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.363
and this way she would
be nextdoor to Becky.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.399
So, they bought that house
and land with that intention.

11:41.501 --> 11:46.171
My uncle always planned on
having that setup for the girls.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.138
That was his dream.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.178
- The plan is to
clean out the house

11:53.280 --> 11:54.446
and then sell the house,

11:54.548 --> 11:57.515
and then my sister and I
are gonna divide the money

11:57.617 --> 12:02.420
and I'm going to build my own
house nextdoor to my sister's

12:02.522 --> 12:04.889
that I'll be able to
use as a little person.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.794
- We have attempted
to clean out the house

12:09.896 --> 12:12.063
for the past year-and-a-half.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.133
A lot of it I've done myself

12:15.235 --> 12:19.370
because it's too emotional
for my sister to be there.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.507
I need help.

12:22.609 --> 12:28.613
I cannot carry that amount of
stuff outta there box by box.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.449
I mean, I thought I
could, but, (pausing)

12:31.551 --> 12:33.551
reality, I cannot.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.554
I will die trying.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.657
I've tried, really did.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.763
I can't do it by myself.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.506
(soft pensive music)

13:16.263 --> 13:17.328
- Since I've moved in,

13:17.430 --> 13:21.166
I'm sure my sister has
felt resentful toward me

13:22.469 --> 13:26.938
because of how dependent
I am on her for things.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.840
It has been a stressful time,

13:28.942 --> 13:32.477
and I'm sure she's very excited

13:32.579 --> 13:34.913
to have me build my own house

13:35.015 --> 13:37.515
and live independently from her.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.050
- We have to get through it.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.487
This has to be our explosion

13:42.589 --> 13:45.957
that helps us put
an end to this.

13:46.059 --> 13:49.394
(rising pensive music)

14:03.009 --> 14:03.875
- Tiffany!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.777
- Hi!
- Hi, Tiffany, how are you?

14:05.879 --> 14:06.544
- Good, how are you?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.213
- I'm good, I'm Dr. David Tolin.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.415
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.851
I'm Dr. David Tolin, I'm
a clinical psychologist,

14:12.953 --> 14:14.285
and I specialize in the study

14:14.387 --> 14:16.187
and treatment of
hoarding disorder.

14:16.289 --> 14:16.988
Here's what I have in mind.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.190
I'd like to take a look inside,

14:19.292 --> 14:20.191
look around the
house a little bit,

14:20.293 --> 14:21.626
but also get to know
you a little bit.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.927
So, I wanna talk
about the house,

14:23.029 --> 14:24.395
talk about you, okay?
- Okay!

14:24.497 --> 14:26.598
- All right, lead the way.
- Come on in!

14:29.035 --> 14:29.868
Okay.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.472
- [David] Okay.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.274
So, Tiffany, can you
tell me a little bit

14:36.376 --> 14:38.710
about what we're
looking at here?

14:38.812 --> 14:40.812
- This is the family room.
- [David] Yeah?

14:40.914 --> 14:42.580
- We used to have
a TV over there.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.083
And then this is the couch.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.017
- [David] Where's the couch?

14:46.119 --> 14:47.051
- Right here.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.019
I know.

14:48.121 --> 14:48.987
- Underneath this
stuff there's a couch?

14:49.089 --> 14:49.988
- Underneath this stuff right-

14:50.090 --> 14:51.589
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I see it.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.692
- Yeah, and then there's
a couch over there.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.563
That's the rest leading up to
the kitchen/dining room area.

14:58.665 --> 14:59.664
- I see.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.532
Now, this is originally
your parents' house,

15:01.635 --> 15:03.334
is that right?
- Yes, yes.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.370
Unfortunately, my
parents passed away.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.171
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you very much.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.808
And my sister and
I have been tasked

15:10.911 --> 15:15.380
with cleaning out the house and
trying to get the hoard down

15:15.482 --> 15:16.748
so that we can sell the house

15:16.850 --> 15:18.449
and I can build
my own house then.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.284
- [David] That's the idea?

15:19.386 --> 15:20.385
- Yes
- Okay.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.454
So, how do you think all
this stuff got in here?

15:23.556 --> 15:26.424
- Oh, it was through my mom,

15:26.526 --> 15:30.295
went to rummage sales
and estate sales.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.298
Some of it, there is a
percentage that is mine

15:33.400 --> 15:37.268
that I was just trying
to carve my own space,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.470
so to speak, in here
because I could see

15:39.572 --> 15:41.105
that everything
just kept coming in.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.374
- So, you think Mom
had a hoarding problem?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.810
- Oh, definitely,
and so did my father,

15:45.912 --> 15:47.278
as you'll see in other
parts of the house.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.880
- [David] So, Mom and Dad
both had hoarding issues.

15:48.982 --> 15:49.981
- Yes.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.950
- How have your actions
contributed to this?

15:52.052 --> 15:55.453
- Well, unfortunately,
you'll see a lot of the books

15:55.555 --> 15:59.590
and then some of the craft
materials have been down here

15:59.693 --> 16:02.894
because there's no more
room in my bedroom.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.863
- You know, as we're
talking, I'm noticing,

16:05.966 --> 16:06.998
I don't know if you've seen,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.367
but there are cracks
along the ceiling here.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.635
- [Tiffany] Yes.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.204
- Now, it's hard to know whether
that's just old sheet rock

16:13.306 --> 16:16.074
or something else, but
I'd be a little worried

16:16.176 --> 16:18.209
that there may be a
structural issue here.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.777
Is there anything
that's heavy up there

16:19.879 --> 16:21.946
that might be causing
pressure on the ceiling?

16:22.048 --> 16:25.817
- Yes, I have quite an
extensive book collection.

16:25.919 --> 16:27.185
- Books are very heavy.
- Yes.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.253
- When you say
"extensive," how extensive?

16:29.356 --> 16:30.555
- Thousands.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.491
(dramatic music)

16:33.593 --> 16:35.259
- Thousands of books?
- Yes.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.427
- Yours?
- Yes.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.397
- Is that gonna be something
we're gonna have to tackle?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.832
- Indeed, and I hope we do.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.234
- I hope so too, okay.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.036
Besides this, are there
any other structural issues

16:45.138 --> 16:46.404
in the house that we
should be aware of?

16:46.506 --> 16:47.472
- Yes, yes.
- Where else?

16:47.574 --> 16:48.639
- [Tiffany] In the basement-

16:48.742 --> 16:50.308
- Down here?
- Yes.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.711
There are two cracked beams.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.179
- Two cracked beams, okay.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.815
So, they may be load-bearing.
- Oh yes.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.517
- Okay, so we wanna be
very careful about that.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.918
- Very careful.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.063
- Hey, Dr. Tolin.
- Hey, what's up, Cory?

17:12.165 --> 17:13.064
How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.065
Good to see you.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.233
I'm Cory Chalmers,
an extreme cleaner

17:15.335 --> 17:17.635
that specializes in
biohazard and hoarding.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.603
- Tiffany, this
is Cory Chalmers.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.937
- Hi, Tiffany.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

17:20.040 --> 17:20.905
- Nice to meet you.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.240
- So, Cory, thanks
for coming out.

17:22.342 --> 17:26.611
So, what we're looking at is
some cracks in the ceiling

17:26.713 --> 17:29.313
that may be the result
of a lotta books

17:29.416 --> 17:30.848
that are on the second floor.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.483
And also, Tiffany was telling me

17:32.585 --> 17:35.019
that there's some cracked
beams in the basement,

17:35.121 --> 17:36.721
so we thought it made sense
to have you look at it

17:36.823 --> 17:37.955
from a structural perspective

17:38.058 --> 17:39.290
before we do much else in there.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.725
- That's a good idea.

17:40.827 --> 17:41.726
Let me go check it out.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.461
I'll come back and
tell you what I think.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.662
- [David] All
right, sounds good.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.296
- Okay? Thank you, guys.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.398
- [Tiffany] Thank you.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.302
(pensive music)

17:52.605 --> 17:54.439
- Walk into the upstairs
of Tiffany's house,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.407
you are just literally
hit in the face

17:56.509 --> 17:58.776
with thousands and
thousands of books.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.446
The biggest concern
with these books

18:01.548 --> 18:04.082
are how much load
they put on the house.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.283
These homes are
built to withstand

18:05.385 --> 18:07.185
about 40 pounds per square foot,

18:07.287 --> 18:08.619
and we're talking about hundreds

18:08.721 --> 18:10.922
if not thousands of
pounds per square foot

18:11.024 --> 18:13.191
that this house has on
it because of the books.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.426
I can't send people up here.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.761
I am not comfortable with this.

18:16.863 --> 18:17.462
There's cracks in every-
(thudding)

18:17.564 --> 18:19.630
Whoa, every single room.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.966
In Tiffany's basement,

18:22.068 --> 18:24.368
there are several
cracked floor joists,

18:25.338 --> 18:26.671
one I can stick my
hand through the crack.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.107
I mean, these are serious
cracks and they're bowing.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.608
I put a level up to it

18:30.710 --> 18:32.477
and you can see the
bubble raised on one side

18:32.579 --> 18:34.512
until I dropped it down
about three inches.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.048
That's a pretty big stress
on these floor joists.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.083
Right above that, we're
seeing a lotta cracks

18:39.185 --> 18:41.352
in the drywall in
ceilings and walls,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.621
which means there's a lotta
movement in this house.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.390
And with that top floor
full of thousands of books,

18:46.493 --> 18:47.558
that is a lotta weight

18:47.660 --> 18:49.894
that could come crumbling
down at any minute.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.029
We gotta talk.

18:57.003 --> 18:57.969
All right, guys.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.204
I have quite a few
concerns, to be honest.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.038
That's a little scary.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.273
- [David] Okay.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.809
- My biggest being
in your basement,

19:04.911 --> 19:06.244
where those floor joists are.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.379
Three of 'em are
actually cracked.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.315
And then where they're not,
they're sloping down so much.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.950
I mean, I put the level up on it

19:13.052 --> 19:14.051
and the bubble was
at the far side

19:14.154 --> 19:16.687
and I'd have to drop it
down about three inches.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.291
So, from wall to wall,
there's a significant drop

19:20.393 --> 19:22.727
because of the weight, and
it's two floors above that.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.995
- Okay.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.630
- I'm not as concerned about
the cracks in the drywall,

19:25.732 --> 19:27.698
but it could mean the
whole house is moving too.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
Too many unknowns for me
to say that it's safe,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.969
so I'd like to call a
structural engineer out

19:32.071 --> 19:34.272
just to give us an evaluation.
- Sure, thank you, Cory.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.240
- Sorry, I wish I
had better news, but-

19:36.342 --> 19:37.508
- No, you know, better
safe than sorry,

19:37.610 --> 19:38.643
and I'm glad that
you took a look.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.577
- Yeah, okay.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.978
I'll make some phone
calls right now,

19:41.080 --> 19:42.747
see what time I can
get one out here,

19:42.849 --> 19:43.814
and then we'll make the decision

19:43.917 --> 19:45.449
based off of their findings.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.952
If this structural
engineer comes out

19:48.054 --> 19:49.820
and deems this house unsafe,

19:49.923 --> 19:52.023
this whole cleanup is
gonna get shut down.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.399
(soft pensive music)

20:09.475 --> 20:12.510
(dramatic music)

20:19.485 --> 20:22.086
- At this point, the entire
cleanup is on hold.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.354
We cannot go in this house

20:23.456 --> 20:25.389
until someone professional
that knows what they're doing

20:25.491 --> 20:29.060
deems it safe or tells us we
literally can't go in there.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.565
(pensive music)

20:39.672 --> 20:42.640
So, you'll see right there
how there's three in a row

20:42.742 --> 20:44.108
that are cracked.
- Oh, yeah.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.611
- [Cory] Split under the weight.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.414
- [Lou] Oh my gosh,
this has totally failed.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.515
- [Cory] Right.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.050
- [Lou] Can see the
cracks all the way across.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.051
- Oh, and this one right here.

20:54.153 --> 20:54.986
Look, here it is.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.988
Can you shine your
light up in here?

20:57.090 --> 20:59.056
There's a third
starting to fail.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.891
So, that's three of these.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.660
My concern, obviously, is we go-

21:02.762 --> 21:04.428
We'll show you the other floors,

21:04.530 --> 21:07.565
but picture now adding 8
to 10 to 12 people up there

21:07.667 --> 21:09.934
cleaning these out,
add in another-

21:10.036 --> 21:11.969
- Oh yeah, I mean, these
are gonna have to be

21:12.071 --> 21:13.771
at least temporarily propped up.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.206
And we're not trying
to permanently

21:15.308 --> 21:16.040
fix the house right now,

21:16.142 --> 21:17.475
we're just trying
to make it safe.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.509
- Let's go look upstairs

21:18.611 --> 21:20.778
and you can kinda give
me your feedback on,

21:21.814 --> 21:23.180
after you see that,

21:23.283 --> 21:25.483
if you believe bracing
down here will even work.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.986
So, now you can
take a look on this.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.022
This is the main floor now.

21:32.258 --> 21:35.760
So, pretty much
everything this way,

21:35.862 --> 21:36.560
just to get an
idea of the weight.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.962
And we see all these cracks.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.730
- [Lou] Yeah,
those are not good.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.733
Yeah, this is
definitely way over

21:42.835 --> 21:45.670
the designed load limit.
(Cory laughing)

21:45.772 --> 21:48.439
So, we would be over
the failure right now.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.174
- [Cory] Correct,
that's my concern

21:50.276 --> 21:52.443
in going back in this area.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.978
So, let me just take
you now upstairs

21:54.080 --> 21:56.414
and you can see where
the real weight is.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.283
- [Lou] Oh, okay. (chuckling)

21:59.385 --> 22:00.284
- [Cory] 'Cause
this, unfortunately,

22:00.386 --> 22:03.020
is only a small
portion of the problem.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.889
Well, come on up here.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.958
And again, this
is why this house

22:08.061 --> 22:09.427
is a little top-heavy right now.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.461
- [Lou] Ooh.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.596
(Lou laughing)

22:12.699 --> 22:14.498
- [Cory] I mean, there is
thousands of books up here.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.268
- Yeah, I mean, there's-
- So much weight.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.403
So, this is that same
part of the house

22:19.505 --> 22:22.406
where all the floor joists
in the basement are broken.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.474
This is where you're
seeing the ceiling-

22:23.576 --> 22:25.109
Look at the damage up here.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.211
Every room has cracks in it.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.846
- Well, all of these cracks

22:28.948 --> 22:33.884
are because the walls
that sit on this floor

22:34.587 --> 22:35.786
are going down with the floor.

22:35.888 --> 22:39.190
And of course, there's no load
on the ceiling joists here,

22:39.292 --> 22:42.293
so it's drywall that's
failing and it's...

22:42.395 --> 22:45.930
It's just distressing
in all directions.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.665
- So, this is just
a cosmetic sign

22:47.767 --> 22:48.999
to the bigger problem.
- So, that's a cosmetic sign

22:49.102 --> 22:50.000
of the real problem,

22:50.103 --> 22:54.405
but this load here
with all these books,

22:54.507 --> 22:57.942
I can't even guess how
many thousands of pounds

22:58.044 --> 22:59.210
we're looking at here.

22:59.312 --> 23:02.480
I'm amazed that this hasn't
just totally collapsed.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.814
- [Cory] Well, can we go
outside and talk then?

23:03.916 --> 23:04.648
I don't really
wanna stay up here

23:04.751 --> 23:06.317
if that's really what you think.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.690
(pensive music)

23:17.063 --> 23:18.329
- Hey, guys.
- Hi there.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.231
- Cory, I want
you to meet Becky.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.232
- This is Cory Chalmers.
- Hi, Becky.

23:21.334 --> 23:22.099
- Hi, Cory, nice to meet you.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.401
- Becky is Tiffany's sister.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.436
And I thought it would be
helpful for her to be here too

23:25.538 --> 23:27.605
since they both kind
of inherited the house,

23:27.707 --> 23:28.906
so I thought it would be helpful

23:29.008 --> 23:31.041
for both of them to hear it.
- Great timing, yeah, perfect.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.143
Well, this is Lou, you guys.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.277
- [Tiffany] Hi, Lou.

23:33.379 --> 23:34.912
- We just walked around
and through the house,

23:35.014 --> 23:36.414
we showed him all the concerns,

23:36.516 --> 23:37.481
some of the ones
that you brought up

23:37.583 --> 23:38.783
and some that I have seen.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.851
So, why don't you just kinda
fill 'em in on what you found

23:40.953 --> 23:42.753
and what you think and
what we need to do.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.655
- Well, the most
serious portion,

23:44.757 --> 23:47.291
it is a lot of distress
every place in this house,

23:47.393 --> 23:49.260
from the walls and the floors.

23:49.362 --> 23:52.363
But the most visible
one is three joists

23:52.465 --> 23:55.699
that support your first floor
right behind the garage here

23:55.802 --> 23:57.568
that are very badly split.

23:57.670 --> 24:01.572
Before there's any kind
of traffic going in there,

24:01.674 --> 24:03.541
we're gonna have to
shore up those joists,

24:03.643 --> 24:08.546
and what I recommend is to
get individual jack posts.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.714
Those you can buy
pretty readily.

24:10.817 --> 24:14.485
So, what we wanna do is
support those three joists

24:14.587 --> 24:17.087
so that there's no
further deflection

24:17.190 --> 24:18.989
and then further failure
because what could happen

24:19.091 --> 24:20.524
is a domino effect.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.460
If those things fail any more,

24:22.562 --> 24:25.229
then the ones next to it
are carrying more weight,

24:25.331 --> 24:26.263
and then they'll fail

24:26.365 --> 24:29.800
and then the whole thing
could just collapse.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.503
So, that's the first
thing we have to do

24:32.605 --> 24:34.972
before we really can
safely get in there.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.141
And I wanna point out,
that's a temporary solution.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.211
For anybody that
would buy this house,

24:40.313 --> 24:42.012
those joists have to
be totally replaced.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.548
And there may be a lot of
other structural members

24:44.650 --> 24:46.116
that have to be replaced,

24:46.219 --> 24:47.818
but you just don't know
until the area's cleared out

24:47.920 --> 24:50.821
and, in fact, even a lotta
the drywall is pulled off,

24:50.923 --> 24:53.557
because you can see a
lotta cracks in drywall

24:53.659 --> 24:55.192
and you've gotta pull that off

24:55.294 --> 24:56.927
and then see what's behind it.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.929
- So, Becky and Tiffany,
what are your thoughts

24:59.031 --> 25:01.065
about what you're
hearing from Lou?

25:01.167 --> 25:04.168
- It's shocking as to how
much damage it has done.

25:06.239 --> 25:10.975
But hopefully we can continue
and get the house cleaned up.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.109
- How about you, Becky?

25:12.211 --> 25:14.578
How are you handling this?
- I'm very nervous.

25:14.680 --> 25:20.784
That scares me to know
that the house is damaged,

25:20.887 --> 25:23.554
but I'm happy to hear we
have the right people here

25:23.656 --> 25:28.659
to help us fix it and
hopefully get this emptied

25:29.829 --> 25:31.629
and taken care of.
- Great, that's my hope too.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.964
- I'm gonna go try to
find some jack stands.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.599
And Lou, again,
thank you very much.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.901
- [Lou] Okay, well, thank
you, it was a pleasure.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.135
- Thank you, Lou,
and thank you, Cory.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.503
- All right, thanks, guys.
- Okay.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.440
(pensive music)

25:50.683 --> 25:52.182
- I wanna be able
to sell this house.

25:52.285 --> 25:55.085
We wanna get as much
money as possible

25:55.187 --> 25:55.853
'cause we're gonna divide it

25:55.955 --> 25:59.189
and then I can buy my own house.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.292
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.593
- It's just sad, you know?

26:02.695 --> 26:03.627
It's hard.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.530
I wanna go fast, I
wanna get so much done.

26:06.632 --> 26:07.965
- Yeah, and it will.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.767
(somber piano music)

26:09.869 --> 26:12.736
(shaky breathing)

26:15.107 --> 26:17.041
Seems like Becky's
pretty stressed out.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.309
- Yes.
- Yeah.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.048
- It's harder for her to
express her feelings sometimes.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.449
- Sure, sure.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.884
- [Tiffany] More so than me.

26:26.986 --> 26:27.885
- [David] Yeah.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.890
I'm just gonna go check in
on Becky real quick, okay?

26:32.992 --> 26:34.458
- [Tiffany] Okay.

26:38.898 --> 26:39.863
- I know you're in no mood,

26:39.966 --> 26:42.766
but can you tell me
what's on your mind?

26:44.403 --> 26:46.003
- [Becky] Just the whole thing.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.272
- [David] The whole thing?

26:49.108 --> 26:50.374
What about it?

26:51.510 --> 26:54.945
- [Becky] I just can't
let that house fall over.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.748
Just can't fall over. (weeping)

26:57.850 --> 26:59.850
- [David] Well, the
house isn't falling over.

27:01.454 --> 27:04.021
- I'm worried about getting
her stuff outta there

27:05.124 --> 27:07.458
and my parents'
stuff outta there.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.993
- [David] You're
worried about that?

27:09.095 --> 27:10.594
What worries you about it?

27:11.764 --> 27:14.665
- [Becky] It's my family's
heirlooms. (weeping)

27:18.738 --> 27:20.871
(beep)

27:22.008 --> 27:23.040
- Are you concerned that
we're gonna get rid of stuff

27:23.142 --> 27:24.541
that you don't wanna get rid of?

27:26.045 --> 27:27.144
- Yeah.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.847
Well, and, I mean, I'm
worried about the whole thing,

27:29.949 --> 27:31.115
the whole house.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.784
- Yeah.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.086
I'm a little worried
about the house too,

27:36.188 --> 27:38.122
but we're gonna
be working on it.

27:39.725 --> 27:43.193
I'm glad that we were able
to spot the damage quickly

27:43.295 --> 27:44.595
and do something about it.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.965
This stirs up a lot, doesn't it?

27:48.067 --> 27:48.966
Yeah.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.201
This is hard.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.004
This is a hard process to go
through, and I feel for you.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.440
I don't know Becky very well.

27:56.542 --> 27:57.908
I've been focusing on Tiffany.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.178
But watching Becky's reaction,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.280
it's clear to me that I'm gonna
have to keep an eye on her

28:03.382 --> 28:05.549
because this is
gonna be hard for her

28:05.651 --> 28:07.818
just as it's hard for Tiffany.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.520
Is there anything
you need right now?

28:11.157 --> 28:12.222
Okay.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.357
Hang in there, okay?

28:13.459 --> 28:14.491
Let me know if
you need anything.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.060
All right?
- Yeah.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.274
(soft pensive music)

28:31.110 --> 28:33.677
(uptempo percussive music)

28:37.349 --> 28:39.983
(truck beeping)

28:55.601 --> 28:57.735
- (laughing) Look how
this thing teeters.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.574
Okay, so you wanna tighten
this one with that 3/4".

29:06.045 --> 29:07.778
That's what we want.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.885
(rain pattering)

29:14.987 --> 29:16.053
- Good morning, everybody.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.354
- [All] Good morning!

29:17.456 --> 29:19.456
- All right, it is a rainy
morning, but we are ready to go,

29:19.558 --> 29:21.592
and so I'm really looking
forward to getting started.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.862
But first, I wanted to
check in with Tiffany, you.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.096
Tell me what your thoughts are

29:26.198 --> 29:27.798
about what you
wanna have happen.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.001
- Well, I'm very excited
and yet nervous also.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.136
- Uh huh.

29:32.238 --> 29:35.706
- I want to get as much
done as humanly possible.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.308
I'm ready to just go fast

29:38.410 --> 29:41.645
and get rid of need-be
stuff and just go.

29:41.747 --> 29:44.081
- Okay, so you're ready to
go and get rid of stuff.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.983
- Rock and roll!
- All right.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.085
Becky, what are you thinking?

29:48.187 --> 29:52.756
- Very nervous, but I'm
ready to get it done also.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.559
- What do you feel
nervous about, Becky?

29:56.729 --> 30:00.197
- So much family history
is inside this house.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.498
- Okay.
(soft piano music)

30:01.600 --> 30:05.202
So, this is not just a simple
throw-it-all-out kinda job.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.203
- Correct.
- We're gonna have to

30:06.305 --> 30:07.671
go through and be
careful with things.

30:07.773 --> 30:10.274
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, okay.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.241
And Jeff, what are your thoughts

30:11.343 --> 30:13.544
about what you wanna
have happen today?

30:13.646 --> 30:16.814
- I'd like to have as much
emptied as we possibly can.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.550
The goal is to empty the house.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.518
- All right, that's the
goal is to empty the house-

30:21.620 --> 30:22.820
- Correct.
- And get it all out there.

30:22.922 --> 30:23.821
All right.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.589
I also wanna welcome
Chris and Christine,

30:25.691 --> 30:28.158
who are cousins from Chicago
who have come to help out,

30:28.260 --> 30:29.993
so thanks for coming
all this way to be here.

30:30.095 --> 30:30.794
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.062
- I appreciate it.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.664
Cory, do you wanna
say a few words?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.134
- Yeah, so when it
comes to the cleanup,

30:37.236 --> 30:41.071
we have plenty of resources
here to get a lot done.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.142
Big concern is the structural
integrity of the house.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.911
This house is under
a tremendous load.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.514
The last thing I wanna do is
put all these bodies in there

30:50.616 --> 30:52.249
on top of the weight
that already exists.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.084
So, we're gonna have
to consider that

30:54.186 --> 30:57.354
and keep that in mind
as we empty things out.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.623
And I know your
stuff is upstairs.

30:59.725 --> 31:02.059
So, starting up there
isn't realistic.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.493
We need to start downstairs

31:03.596 --> 31:04.661
and get some of
that weight and load

31:04.763 --> 31:06.296
off of that first floor.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.566
We wanna see everybody's
involvement in this sorting.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.034
We have these
amazing organizers,

31:11.136 --> 31:12.636
they're gonna be back
there helping you.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.271
That way we can learn
what kinda decisions

31:14.373 --> 31:15.472
you're all gonna make.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.175
You have the goal of clearing
your stuff outta here

31:18.277 --> 31:19.309
to start a new life.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.879
You have the goal of
emptying the entire house.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.080
Becky has some attachment

31:23.182 --> 31:26.450
and emotional issues that
may come up and you may too,

31:26.552 --> 31:29.219
so we just need to start this
process and see where it goes

31:29.321 --> 31:32.022
so that we know how best to
proceed the next few days.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.091
That sound like a good plan?

31:34.193 --> 31:35.125
- [Tiffany] Sounds great.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.094
- I'm here not just
to clean out a house,

31:37.196 --> 31:39.162
but I'm here to actually
work on hoarding

31:39.265 --> 31:40.831
and here to help make
sure that we address

31:40.933 --> 31:43.267
the reasons why this
happened in the first place

31:43.369 --> 31:45.002
so that it doesn't happen again.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.304
So, that's where I'm gonna
be working with you, Tiffany,

31:47.406 --> 31:49.606
on this and working on
your decision-making,

31:49.708 --> 31:50.908
so you'll see a lot of me

31:51.010 --> 31:52.676
as we go through
this process as well.

31:52.778 --> 31:53.844
- [Tiffany] Good!

31:53.946 --> 31:55.145
- All right, so are you
guys ready to get started?

31:55.247 --> 31:55.946
- Absolutely.
- Let's go!

31:56.048 --> 31:57.614
- Let's do this.
- All right!

32:00.286 --> 32:01.218
Thank you.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.022
(lighthearted music)

32:05.124 --> 32:06.056
- [Man] We'll be
handing this over.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.458
- [Man] Gather all the
organizers, please.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.862
- It's one decision:
keep, donate, or discard.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.330
That's what we wanna do.
- Okay.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.332
- We don't say, "Make
a decision later."

32:15.434 --> 32:17.100
We wanna make all
the decisions now.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.035
You good with that?

32:18.137 --> 32:19.603
- Yeah, oh yeah.
- All right, perfect.

32:21.807 --> 32:22.673
- Garbage?
- No.

32:22.775 --> 32:23.640
Garbage.
- Garbage.

32:23.742 --> 32:24.441
No.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.676
No, no.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.211
- Do you see any treasures
that we care about?

32:28.314 --> 32:29.780
- No.
- Thank you.

32:29.882 --> 32:30.580
- No.
- Nope.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.083
- You're doing great, Tiffany!

32:33.185 --> 32:35.052
- I tell ya, I'm
ready to rock and roll

32:35.154 --> 32:36.753
and I want things to happen.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.726
Woo, look how fast we're going!

32:42.828 --> 32:45.262
- Let's keep it up, okay?
- Yeah, let's keep it up!

32:45.364 --> 32:48.265
(Tiffany laughing)

32:53.038 --> 32:54.905
- You guys mentioned you
wanted to work on the garage?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.173
- Correct.
- Yep.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.675
- Yeah, I am perfectly fine
with that if you guys are.

32:58.777 --> 32:59.977
If they can open
that garage door,

33:00.079 --> 33:03.046
the dumpster is right there,
and if they feel it's trash...

33:03.148 --> 33:04.147
Sound good?
- Are you okay

33:04.249 --> 33:06.917
with letting them make
decision on your behalf?

33:07.019 --> 33:08.785
- Absolutely.
- All right, great.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.997
- [Jake] Sure you don't want
that for your living room?

33:20.099 --> 33:20.797
- [Jeff] No.

33:20.899 --> 33:23.867
(upbeat music)

33:35.848 --> 33:38.749
(boxes clattering)

33:46.158 --> 33:48.492
- On the first day, we have
filled two and a half dumpsters.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.328
I think that's a record for
one of these cleanups for me.

33:57.069 --> 34:00.103
(soft, calm music)

34:04.877 --> 34:06.710
- [Becky] Look at all
this room in here now.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.812
- [Tiffany] Oh my god.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.048
- [Cory] Wow, you guys
did a lot out here.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.717
- [David] Yeah, great job, guys.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.185
- [Tiffany] Amazing.

34:15.287 --> 34:17.821
- What is this under the tarp?

34:17.923 --> 34:24.961
- Well, this is my father's
1978 Indy Pace Car Corvette.

34:25.064 --> 34:26.396
- Do you guys mind
if we uncover it?

34:26.498 --> 34:27.564
- [Tiffany] No problem!

34:27.666 --> 34:29.966
- [Becky] It was one of my
dad's prized possessions.

34:30.069 --> 34:30.700
- [Cory] I bet!

34:30.803 --> 34:32.536
- [Becky] He loved this car.

34:33.539 --> 34:34.471
- [David] Oh, wow.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.007
- [Tiffany] Haven't
seen that in forever.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.643
- [Cory] Yeah, when was
the last time you saw it?

34:39.745 --> 34:43.980
- My husband has never
seen it, 30 years.

34:44.083 --> 34:44.981
- [Jeff] This is something.

34:45.084 --> 34:45.949
- [David] Quite a car.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.351
- [Cory] It's
beautiful, it really is.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.886
It's nice to see
at least one thing

34:49.988 --> 34:53.090
that's been taken
care of and protected.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.124
- [Tiffany] Mm-hmm.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.392
- What is the plan for the car?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.327
Is that something you guys
are gonna keep in the family?

34:57.429 --> 34:59.029
Sell?
- Yes.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.598
It is...

35:01.700 --> 35:03.934
This is my dad to me.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.772
I always enjoyed going for
the rides with him in the car,

35:08.874 --> 35:11.575
and so my husband and
I hope to keep it.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.643
- [Cory] That's awesome.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.112
- [Tiffany] And get
speeding tickets.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.713
(all laughing)

35:16.815 --> 35:17.714
- [Cory] If they can catch ya.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.616
- Exactly.
- Ooh! (laughing)

35:19.718 --> 35:21.318
- What do you think
about the progress today?

35:21.420 --> 35:22.586
- The progress has been amazing.

35:22.688 --> 35:23.753
I've been able to
take a backseat

35:23.856 --> 35:26.223
and just watch the process,
which is nice for me.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.492
I'm interested in
seeing what happens

35:28.594 --> 35:31.595
when we get to the stuff that
you don't wanna get rid of,

35:31.697 --> 35:33.530
'cause that's the stuff that
I'll wanna talk to you about,

35:33.632 --> 35:34.798
but we'll get there when we do.

35:34.900 --> 35:35.866
- Okay.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.569
(pensive music)

35:44.877 --> 35:49.479
As you can see, a
lotta books I've got

35:49.581 --> 35:52.749
from working in a
bookstore for 16 years.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.118
- So, it's all this, all this,

35:55.220 --> 35:57.053
I see some books in there.
- Yep.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.056
- [Cory] How many books
is your best guess

36:00.159 --> 36:01.424
of how many you have?

36:04.062 --> 36:07.397
- Between 5,000 and 10,000.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.132
- [Cory] What we're hoping
is that you can give her

36:09.234 --> 36:11.134
a general idea.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.904
- [Keith] Was there
anything you were expecting

36:14.006 --> 36:16.873
in terms of what you wanted
to get for the books?

36:17.910 --> 36:20.277
- No, not necessarily.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.146
- [Keith] You're not
ready to give me a figure

36:23.248 --> 36:25.415
that what you were hoping for

36:25.517 --> 36:28.919
or you just want me
to give you a figure?

36:29.021 --> 36:29.853
- Yes.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.521
I'd prefer that, please.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.691
- Okay, I'm gonna
just go for it.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.359
- Okay.

36:36.461 --> 36:37.394
- $1,000.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.597
- Okay.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.365
Wow, okay.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.935
- [Cory] Is $1,000 an
offer you will accept?

36:52.878 --> 36:55.512
(soft pensive music)

37:16.868 --> 37:17.767
Good morning, you guys.

37:17.869 --> 37:18.735
- [All] Good morning!

37:18.837 --> 37:21.137
- We had an incredible
day yesterday.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.505
So, first thing
we always wanna do

37:22.608 --> 37:24.741
is check in and so
how you're doing

37:24.843 --> 37:26.243
after the first big push.

37:27.312 --> 37:30.480
- Well, there were times
of sadness last night

37:30.582 --> 37:33.450
and just thinking about
everything that happened.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.153
There were some things
in the family room,

37:37.256 --> 37:39.923
but it's okay that they're gone.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.258
It really truly is.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.494
And then there was some paint
in the hallway that was taken.

37:44.596 --> 37:48.665
That's okay 'cause as a
hoarder I've got more.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.633
- Well, let me
apologize for that.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.801
I mean, the aim
here is, of course,

37:51.903 --> 37:53.103
not to throw away
things that you want

37:53.205 --> 37:54.404
without your permission,

37:54.506 --> 37:55.739
and so I'm sorry
that that happened.

37:55.841 --> 38:00.577
- I'm still here, I'm still
alive, everything's going good,

38:00.979 --> 38:02.212
and so what?

38:02.314 --> 38:04.781
Three things got taken away

38:04.883 --> 38:07.751
that I haven't
seen for 30 years.

38:07.853 --> 38:08.918
Okay.

38:09.021 --> 38:11.755
I'm standing, so that's fine.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.724
- I know there's some things
that you thought were missing

38:14.826 --> 38:17.360
and I heard it was paperwork
in that front entryway.

38:17.462 --> 38:20.497
I did that and those boxes
absolutely came out here.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.199
- I did hear that the
boxes came out here

38:23.302 --> 38:27.103
and that's great and
thank you for that.

38:27.205 --> 38:28.738
- And Jeff, how about you?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.240
How did you think things went?

38:30.342 --> 38:32.175
- I thought they went good.

38:32.277 --> 38:33.977
I was surprised and shocked

38:34.079 --> 38:37.414
at the amount of things
that my wife didn't keep.

38:37.516 --> 38:41.651
I only had three items in my
van when I left last night,

38:41.753 --> 38:46.656
so that was a good thing.
- That is a good thing.

38:47.225 --> 38:47.957
Rachel, how about you?

38:48.060 --> 38:49.459
What was your sense of it?

38:49.561 --> 38:51.227
- I think it went
pretty well yesterday.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.363
I was proud of
Tiffany and my mom

38:53.465 --> 38:54.964
for getting rid of
a bunch of stuff.

38:55.067 --> 38:56.466
- And you really
helped yesterday,

38:56.568 --> 38:57.600
so thank you for that.

38:57.703 --> 38:58.268
- Mm-hmm.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.336
- So, we left yesterday

38:59.438 --> 39:01.971
of the offer of the
books for $1,000.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.107
Did you make up your mind
on what you were gonna do?

39:04.209 --> 39:05.742
- Yes, I will take the offer.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.976
- Perfect.
- Yes.

39:07.079 --> 39:08.678
And I appreciate
that they came out

39:08.780 --> 39:10.747
and that they're taking 'em away

39:10.849 --> 39:13.016
and that they're gonna
go to loving homes.

39:13.118 --> 39:16.086
Sounds like a pet or
something, but it is.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.390
They're book people, and book
people understand one another.

39:20.492 --> 39:23.159
And I know that they know
how hard it is for me,

39:23.261 --> 39:25.895
so that's very comforting also.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.731
- So, it's an easier
decision for you to make

39:27.833 --> 39:29.666
if you know that it's
going to a good use.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.401
- Oh yeah, for sure.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.236
And then whatever they can't use

39:33.338 --> 39:34.738
they're going to donate

39:34.840 --> 39:39.109
to the Waukesha
County library system,

39:39.211 --> 39:40.877
so maybe I borrow it.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.112
- There you go.
(all laughing)

39:42.314 --> 39:45.949
Right, you can borrow the
books and then bring 'em back.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.550
- Right, bring 'em back, right,

39:47.652 --> 39:50.854
which is what I've
done at Becky's house.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.422
- If it turned out that
some of these books

39:52.524 --> 39:53.556
get donated to the library

39:53.658 --> 39:55.892
and if Tiffany wants to
then go to the library

39:55.994 --> 39:58.328
and borrow those books
back, that's wonderful!

39:58.430 --> 40:00.130
What a great solution!

40:00.232 --> 40:01.698
She can still enjoy her books,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.366
but she doesn't have
to have them all

40:03.468 --> 40:04.768
cluttering up her house.

40:06.071 --> 40:06.970
- Give us a few minutes

40:07.072 --> 40:08.204
and then we'll get
started on the books.

40:08.306 --> 40:09.038
- [Tiffany] Sounds great!

40:09.141 --> 40:10.507
- All right, let's go.
- Amen!

40:10.609 --> 40:13.309
(pensive music)

40:16.348 --> 40:17.547
- Yes, that's a save.

40:19.718 --> 40:20.583
- [Man] This is
going out, right?

40:20.685 --> 40:22.452
- Yeah, that goes with this.
- I know.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.320
- [Man] Tell her
where it came from.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.828
(dramatic music)

40:45.977 --> 40:49.279
- [Tiffany] Okay, Dr.
Tolin, here's the challenge.

40:49.381 --> 40:50.914
- [David] Yeah, tell me what
we're looking at here, Tiffany.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.850
- [Tiffany] We are
looking at my paints.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.653
There are gonna be
more coming out.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.087
- [David] There's
gonna be even more?

40:58.190 --> 40:59.055
- [Tiffany] Oh yeah.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.390
- So, we've got some
decisions to make.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.424
And I guess the first question

41:01.526 --> 41:04.127
is how much of this
do you actually need?

41:04.229 --> 41:05.862
I mean, I understand that
art is important to you,

41:05.964 --> 41:08.665
but how much paint do you
need in order to do your art?

41:08.767 --> 41:10.266
- That I don't know.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.902
- You don't know?
- I can safely tell you

41:13.004 --> 41:17.474
that my perception of
this is very skewed.

41:17.576 --> 41:18.675
- [David] Yeah.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.479
- Because it comes down to,
"Oh, I want every color,"

41:24.249 --> 41:26.249
and then you can't find
it and then you're like,

41:26.351 --> 41:28.685
"I gotta start getting the
colors all over again."

41:28.787 --> 41:30.820
- Okay, so you recognize
that your perception is off.

41:30.922 --> 41:31.821
- Oh, yes!

41:31.923 --> 41:34.591
- So, let's go back
to the big picture,

41:34.693 --> 41:36.359
what you're looking for, right?

41:36.461 --> 41:38.928
What you want is a
comfortable home.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.030
You want to not hoard it up.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.999
You wanna make sure that
you have enough room

41:43.101 --> 41:44.501
that you can
actually do your art,

41:44.603 --> 41:46.302
not just have the
stuff for the art.

41:46.404 --> 41:47.570
- [Tiffany] Right.

41:47.672 --> 41:48.705
- So, the tricky decision

41:48.807 --> 41:50.006
that you're gonna have
to make here, Tiffany,

41:50.108 --> 41:52.909
is to figure out how much
paint you really need

41:54.012 --> 41:56.012
and to be willing to
let go of the rest.

41:56.114 --> 41:56.813
- Okay.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.182
We could get rid of this.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.250
- You could get
rid of that, okay.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.951
- Yep.
- All right, good.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.554
Now, let me ask a quick
question before we toss it out.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.155
How did you make that decision?

42:07.526 --> 42:09.859
- Because those...

42:10.829 --> 42:13.730
I used 'em once, I
thought they were cool,

42:14.866 --> 42:17.033
and they're not the main-

42:17.135 --> 42:18.835
They're not what I
wanna do anymore.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.937
- [David] Okay, so those are
not particularly useful to you.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.005
- [Tiffany] Right.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.439
- [David] So, that's a
pretty easy decision,

42:23.542 --> 42:24.674
relatively speaking.
- Right.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.677
- Okay, now could you make
a slightly harder decision?

42:27.779 --> 42:30.113
Remembering again that
what we're trying to do

42:30.215 --> 42:32.482
is we're trying to
overcome hoarding.

42:32.584 --> 42:35.285
We're trying to really get
this problem under control.

42:35.387 --> 42:35.919
- Right.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.554
This was on clearance.

42:37.656 --> 42:39.889
Oh, and I already see,
this is pretty old.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.024
- [David] It does
look pretty old, yeah.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.592
- So, buh-bye to that.

42:42.694 --> 42:43.693
You know what?

42:43.795 --> 42:46.229
I don't think I'm gonna
use pastels for a while.

42:46.331 --> 42:48.631
- [Carolina] Okay, so we
can get rid of pastels.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.265
- [David] Great.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.099
- [Tiffany] This...

42:50.201 --> 42:51.100
This is buh-bye.

42:51.202 --> 42:52.101
- All of it?
- This whole thing.

42:52.203 --> 42:53.336
- All of this, okay.
- Yeah.

42:55.974 --> 42:57.574
- How's it going out here?
- Thank you.

42:57.676 --> 42:58.575
- Tiffany is doing great.

42:58.677 --> 43:00.209
She's making some
really tough decisions,

43:00.312 --> 43:01.477
but she's doing
a good job of it.

43:01.580 --> 43:02.679
- There's more in
your room, right?

43:02.781 --> 43:04.247
- Yeah; when we get to my room,

43:04.349 --> 43:06.049
it will be a much
easier decision.

43:06.151 --> 43:07.216
- [David] You think so?

43:07.319 --> 43:08.985
- Well, yeah, because
I already got all this!

43:09.087 --> 43:10.820
- [David] Okay, so,
meaning, holding this,

43:10.922 --> 43:11.721
you're thinking this might be

43:11.823 --> 43:12.956
enough paint for you?
- Yeah!

43:13.058 --> 43:14.891
- [David] Are you saying
the rest of it could go?

43:14.993 --> 43:16.192
- Yes.

43:16.294 --> 43:16.960
- Okay!

43:17.062 --> 43:19.896
(upbeat music)

43:24.269 --> 43:25.702
Hey, how's it going in here?

43:26.538 --> 43:27.837
- Okay.
- Yeah?

43:29.474 --> 43:31.774
Any emotions getting stirred up?

43:31.876 --> 43:32.775
- Yeah.
- Some?

43:32.877 --> 43:34.911
What are you experiencing?

43:35.013 --> 43:38.147
- I'm really upset at how
awful it looks in here.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.950
- [David] What
looks awful to you?

43:41.052 --> 43:42.719
- The floor.
- The floor?

43:42.821 --> 43:44.821
Are you talking about the
damage to the floor and the-

43:44.923 --> 43:46.456
Yeah.

43:46.558 --> 43:47.457
What else?

43:48.860 --> 43:50.793
- I'm really excited
to see that wall.

43:52.130 --> 43:56.899
That's what this room was to
me was that wall of those-

43:57.769 --> 43:59.135
- The little knickknacks
and stuff, yeah.

43:59.237 --> 44:01.104
What else does it
stir up for you?

44:04.342 --> 44:06.009
I can see the tears
in Becky's eyes.

44:06.111 --> 44:08.311
I can see that she's
experiencing pain.

44:08.413 --> 44:10.413
But Becky isn't quite
opening up to me.

44:10.515 --> 44:11.981
- See the other couch there?

44:12.083 --> 44:13.683
- Yeah, I see that.
- Just a piece of it.

44:13.785 --> 44:15.451
- Yeah, I see that.

44:15.553 --> 44:17.887
I'm getting bits and pieces
of it here and there.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.555
But for the most part,

44:19.658 --> 44:21.457
Becky remains a little
bit of a mystery to me.

44:21.559 --> 44:22.959
- How did it get this way?

44:23.061 --> 44:24.060
How did...

44:24.162 --> 44:25.328
I don't know.

44:26.931 --> 44:29.632
(Becky sighing)

44:34.506 --> 44:36.039
(soft pensive music)

44:36.141 --> 44:39.175
(dramatic music)

44:44.649 --> 44:47.784
- Tiffany lived with my
parents for her whole life.

44:49.721 --> 44:52.755
- The entire house
has, over the years,

44:52.857 --> 44:55.758
been filled with my mom
and my father's hoarding

44:55.860 --> 44:57.560
and then my hoarding also.

45:00.498 --> 45:04.233
- My parents passed
away 10 months apart.

45:04.335 --> 45:05.868
Our lives changed.

45:05.970 --> 45:09.105
- My sister and I
have been tasked

45:09.207 --> 45:10.840
with cleaning out the house.

45:10.942 --> 45:13.943
We can sell the house and I
can build my own house then.

45:21.286 --> 45:24.754
- [Becky] I couldn't
let her live in that.

45:28.193 --> 45:31.360
(somber piano music)

45:36.468 --> 45:38.367
- [David] How's it
going up here, guys?

45:40.071 --> 45:41.571
- Sad.
- Yeah?

45:41.673 --> 45:43.806
What are you feeling sad about?

45:43.908 --> 45:46.642
- I remember spending Christmas
in here with her family.

45:49.514 --> 45:51.781
A lotta memories.
- Yeah.

45:51.883 --> 45:52.648
Good memories?

45:52.751 --> 45:53.683
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.121
So, where does the
sadness come from?

45:58.223 --> 46:00.890
- Just that it became this.

46:02.861 --> 46:04.327
- [David] That this happened?

46:04.996 --> 46:06.362
- [Jeff] Very much.

46:06.464 --> 46:07.563
- [David] Those good
memories got sorta buried

46:07.665 --> 46:08.631
under the clutter.

46:09.334 --> 46:10.133
- It's just...

46:10.235 --> 46:12.635
It's just sad.

46:12.737 --> 46:14.570
Upsetting.
- Right.

46:14.672 --> 46:15.705
- Depressing.

46:15.807 --> 46:19.308
Here's my wife's high
school graduation picture

46:19.410 --> 46:21.844
on the wall back there.
- Right, but buried.

46:21.946 --> 46:25.148
I mean, just completely
obscured by all the hoarding.

46:25.250 --> 46:28.084
That's what hoarding does is
it just smothers everything.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.419
- I never imagined.

46:30.522 --> 46:31.687
I never imagined.

46:31.790 --> 46:32.822
- When did you know?

46:34.259 --> 46:38.194
- About 15 years; I
mean, give or take.

46:39.497 --> 46:40.730
- [Becky] But you
didn't know this.

46:40.832 --> 46:43.065
- [Jeff] I didn't have, yeah,
I didn't have a clue of this.

46:43.168 --> 46:44.267
- This is beyond.

46:44.369 --> 46:45.835
- [David] You didn't know
about the extent of it.

46:45.937 --> 46:47.069
- Not like this.
- No, no.

46:47.172 --> 46:48.538
- They always had a lotta stuff,

46:48.640 --> 46:52.241
but this is like (pausing)
a different level.

46:52.343 --> 46:56.946
- You could walk in here and
everything that's on the walls

46:57.048 --> 46:58.815
you could see and it was-

47:00.218 --> 47:04.887
And (pausing) to see it like
this is just heartbreaking.

47:05.590 --> 47:06.122
- [Becky] It's heartbreaking.

47:07.258 --> 47:08.491
- [David] Becky, were you
aware of the extent of it?

47:08.593 --> 47:09.692
- No.

47:09.794 --> 47:12.595
I still can't even comprehend.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.163
I mean, this is thick!

47:14.265 --> 47:15.231
- [David] Yeah, you look
at something like this

47:15.333 --> 47:17.967
and go, "How did this happen?"
- Six feet tall!

47:18.069 --> 47:22.004
And that wall is 10
feet away from me!

47:22.106 --> 47:22.972
- Yeah.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.808
It's a lotta very
densely-packed stuff.

47:25.910 --> 47:29.478
I mean, it's almost like
there has to be a grief

47:29.581 --> 47:32.315
for the loss of this
beautiful house.

47:33.484 --> 47:34.784
- [Becky] Yeah.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.988
- Never imagined that
this would happen.

47:40.325 --> 47:41.190
- The good thing about it

47:41.292 --> 47:42.925
is you still have
those good memories

47:43.027 --> 47:45.194
in your minds and in your hearts

47:45.296 --> 47:46.462
and you can remember
this nice place

47:46.564 --> 47:48.598
and you can remember
your parents

47:48.700 --> 47:51.300
and you can remember the good
times that you all had here.

47:51.402 --> 47:54.070
- I remember chasing Tiffany
around the circle here.

47:54.172 --> 47:54.804
- Oh yeah?
(Becky laughing)

47:54.906 --> 47:56.405
- Oh yeah.

47:56.507 --> 47:58.040
But yeah, it's time to move on.

47:59.043 --> 47:59.942
- [Becky] Yep.

48:00.712 --> 48:01.878
Time to see the wall.

48:03.448 --> 48:05.781
- [David] Operation See
the Wall, all right.

48:09.554 --> 48:12.622
(soft pensive music)

48:19.831 --> 48:21.497
- [Woman] Another box down.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.199
- [Christine] You didn't
expect that, huh, Rachel?

48:23.301 --> 48:26.302
(items clattering)

48:36.581 --> 48:38.080
- No, no, 'cause it stinks.
- There's no pictures in there

48:38.182 --> 48:39.282
and it's paper; okay.

48:40.318 --> 48:42.785
It's mostly notebooks-
- How about none of it?

48:42.887 --> 48:44.053
Buh-bye.
- Sweet!

48:47.125 --> 48:48.524
- Thank you.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.293
I know, I'm so-
- Tiffany,

48:50.395 --> 48:52.395
that was awesome!

48:52.497 --> 48:54.330
You took it good!

48:54.432 --> 48:55.998
- Becky showed
some emotion today,

48:56.100 --> 48:57.900
Jeff showed some emotion today.

48:58.002 --> 48:59.435
The one person that
we didn't really see

48:59.537 --> 49:01.704
any negative emotion
from was Tiffany,

49:01.806 --> 49:04.407
the one person that we
know has hoarding disorder.

49:04.509 --> 49:06.542
So, we would expect that
Tiffany would be feeling

49:06.644 --> 49:09.712
a lot of strong negative
emotions during this process,

49:09.814 --> 49:12.281
but she's got a big
smile and she's laughing.

49:12.383 --> 49:13.683
- Oh, I want that
little clipboard.

49:13.785 --> 49:14.517
- [Carolina] Okay.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.185
(Tiffany laughing)

49:16.287 --> 49:19.155
- And that either means
that she's just really happy

49:19.257 --> 49:20.756
and relieved to be doing this

49:20.858 --> 49:22.825
or that her smile is
masking some pain.

49:22.927 --> 49:25.261
I need to ask her
more about that.

49:34.872 --> 49:37.173
You've been doing great today.
- Thank you.

49:37.275 --> 49:38.507
- You've been moving fast.

49:38.609 --> 49:42.078
You've been throwing away,
geez, I'd say 99% of the stuff

49:42.180 --> 49:42.912
that's brought in front of you.

49:43.014 --> 49:44.146
So, you're letting things go

49:44.248 --> 49:45.815
and you're doing it all
with a great temperament

49:45.917 --> 49:47.650
and good cheer.
- Thank you.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.685
- And when I see somebody
smiling and laughing,

49:49.787 --> 49:52.188
I think that it means
one of two things.

49:52.290 --> 49:55.224
One is it means that they're
happy and having a good time.

49:55.326 --> 49:56.892
- Yeah.

49:56.995 --> 50:00.830
- And two is that there is
something being hidden.

50:01.899 --> 50:04.200
And that thing that
sometimes gets hidden

50:04.302 --> 50:06.535
behind laughter is pain.

50:06.637 --> 50:09.071
And I just wanna
check on that and see,

50:09.173 --> 50:11.674
are you experiencing any pain

50:11.776 --> 50:13.642
that you feel like you have
to cover up with a smile?

50:13.745 --> 50:14.810
- Oh, no, no.

50:14.912 --> 50:16.812
This is my natural way.

50:17.949 --> 50:19.482
- I wanna make sure
that you don't feel

50:19.584 --> 50:21.751
like you need to do a
good job to impress us

50:21.853 --> 50:23.786
or that you have to throw
things away to make us happy.

50:23.888 --> 50:25.121
- No, no.
- Okay.

50:25.223 --> 50:28.591
- I'm not shy about crying
or letting my emotions out.

50:28.693 --> 50:29.625
- Okay, is there anything at all

50:29.727 --> 50:32.128
that you're feeling,
right now, regret about?

50:33.264 --> 50:34.096
- No.

50:34.198 --> 50:36.132
I'm just looking
forward to the new life.

50:36.234 --> 50:38.100
- The big stack of books?
- No.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.435
- You're feeling
good about that?

50:39.537 --> 50:41.737
You're feeling good about all
the stuff that you've let go?

50:41.839 --> 50:42.772
- [Tiffany] Yeah, truly.

50:42.874 --> 50:43.806
- Not having second
thoughts about it, okay.

50:43.908 --> 50:45.207
- Right, truly.
- I just wanna check in.

50:45.309 --> 50:46.275
- Yeah, I know, I know.

50:46.377 --> 50:47.743
- [David] I'm not trying
to make more out of it

50:47.845 --> 50:48.878
than there is, I
just wanna make sure

50:48.980 --> 50:50.646
I'm not overlooking something.

50:50.748 --> 50:51.881
- You guys are
both doing amazing.

50:51.983 --> 50:55.017
I mean, I can't... (laughing)

50:55.119 --> 50:58.120
I'm speechless because we
just don't move this fast

50:58.222 --> 51:01.657
typically without a
lot more problems.

51:01.759 --> 51:04.794
Tomorrow, we're gonna start
back upstairs, I think.

51:04.896 --> 51:08.264
You can tell us what room
might be easier or harder.

51:08.366 --> 51:11.000
- Maybe we should focus
on what's hard tomorrow.

51:11.102 --> 51:14.270
I mean, we did that today too,
but I think tomorrow as well.

51:14.372 --> 51:15.738
Let's really focus
in on the stuff

51:15.840 --> 51:17.273
that would give you trouble.

51:17.375 --> 51:18.441
You too.

51:18.543 --> 51:21.110
Let's focus on the ouch
points if we can find 'em.

51:21.212 --> 51:22.411
- Okay.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.380
- And we'll make sure that
we get those taken care of,

51:24.482 --> 51:26.715
so that way anything
that's left over

51:26.818 --> 51:29.652
is the easier stuff that
you guys can do on your own.

51:30.955 --> 51:33.656
- I'm looking forward to
getting upstairs tomorrow,

51:35.226 --> 51:39.328
but I am apprehensive
about the emotional toll

51:39.430 --> 51:44.200
of the items 'cause they are
more personal in the bedrooms.

51:50.808 --> 51:53.476
(soft pensive music)

51:55.947 --> 51:58.814
(soft piano music)

52:05.523 --> 52:07.723
- We're really trying to get
this house as empty as possible

52:07.825 --> 52:09.091
because tomorrow
we have an investor

52:09.193 --> 52:10.960
and appraiser coming
out to look at the house

52:11.062 --> 52:12.595
and I think they'll get
a little bit more money

52:12.697 --> 52:14.730
if it doesn't have
all this stuff in it.

52:32.083 --> 52:34.884
- Tiffany, do you have enough
of this granite and stuff?

52:34.986 --> 52:36.519
Can we pitch this now?

52:36.621 --> 52:38.988
- Yeah, I don't ever wanna
see that again in my life!

52:39.090 --> 52:41.924
(trash clattering)

53:02.547 --> 53:04.313
- [David] So, what's the
story; what happened?

53:04.415 --> 53:05.548
- [Tim] Becky was overheating.

53:05.650 --> 53:06.649
- [David] Oh,
getting overheated?

53:06.751 --> 53:08.284
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

53:08.386 --> 53:10.452
- Look here, look
right here at my nose.

53:11.122 --> 53:12.087
All right.

53:13.090 --> 53:14.623
- [David] So, how much
of this is overheating

53:14.725 --> 53:16.559
and how much is
emotional, do you think?

53:16.661 --> 53:18.160
- Both.
- Both.

53:18.262 --> 53:21.263
Becky, tell me about
the emotional part.

53:21.365 --> 53:22.498
What's happening with you?

53:26.103 --> 53:27.469
- Just seeing my carpet.

53:27.572 --> 53:29.271
- Mm-hmm, what about that?

53:29.373 --> 53:32.641
- Haven't seen it in so long.
(soft piano music)

53:32.743 --> 53:33.909
- So, you haven't seen
the carpet in so long,

53:34.011 --> 53:38.547
but what about that caused
an emotional reaction in you?

53:38.649 --> 53:41.217
- Just seeing that,

53:41.319 --> 53:44.353
how long it took us to
get down to even see it.

53:45.323 --> 53:46.789
- And that means what to you?

53:48.092 --> 53:49.725
- [Becky] It's just ridiculous.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.561
- So, Becky, this would
be a really good time

53:52.663 --> 53:54.363
to talk about how
you're feeling.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.299
Can you open up a little bit

53:57.401 --> 53:59.335
and tell me what's
going on with you?

54:01.606 --> 54:03.138
- I'm just sad.

54:03.241 --> 54:04.773
- [David] Tell me about the sad.

54:04.875 --> 54:05.574
What are you feeling sad about?

54:05.676 --> 54:07.109
- All this stuff.

54:09.113 --> 54:10.813
- Say more about
that, could you?

54:16.887 --> 54:19.922
- It's just sad how they
collected all this stuff.

54:20.024 --> 54:22.358
I'm mad too.
- Mad.

54:22.460 --> 54:23.726
What are you mad about?

54:24.795 --> 54:27.596
- They left me with all of
this (beep) to clean up.

54:34.672 --> 54:35.771
- So, there's a mix here.

54:35.873 --> 54:37.840
You're feeling sad about how
your parents were living,

54:37.942 --> 54:40.442
but also mad that they
left it all for you.

54:49.987 --> 54:50.919
- [Jeff] Becky?

54:51.922 --> 54:54.456
You all right?
- Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

54:56.160 --> 54:57.293
- You okay?
- Yeah.

55:02.533 --> 55:04.466
- You don't seem okay.

55:10.041 --> 55:12.508
- I know they didn't leave
it to try to kill me.

55:12.610 --> 55:15.110
I know they had a problem.

55:15.212 --> 55:16.445
- They had a big problem.

55:16.547 --> 55:19.081
- A big problem. (laughing)

55:19.183 --> 55:21.317
A big problem that they
can't take with 'em.

55:21.419 --> 55:22.384
- That's right.

55:23.521 --> 55:26.055
Becky's really crying and
not really wanting to talk,

55:26.157 --> 55:28.590
but clearly she's going
through something powerful,

55:28.693 --> 55:30.559
so I encourage her to open up.

55:30.661 --> 55:31.894
When we hold it all inside,

55:31.996 --> 55:34.663
often, it's hard
for us to process.

55:34.765 --> 55:37.433
When we talk about it, often
it becomes easier for us

55:37.535 --> 55:40.602
to think about it more
clearly and move past it.

55:42.707 --> 55:44.306
Yeah, I think you're at the
point where you're finally able

55:44.408 --> 55:47.476
to close this
particular chapter,

55:47.578 --> 55:51.113
the hoarding chapter, and
open up a new chapter,

55:51.215 --> 55:53.082
a new life for you
and for Tiffany,

55:55.286 --> 55:57.052
that you can be
free of this burden.

56:01.792 --> 56:04.259
(pensive music)

56:04.362 --> 56:05.394
- Let's do it.

56:05.496 --> 56:06.328
Incoming!

56:07.331 --> 56:08.464
- [Man] Ready, switch.

56:19.377 --> 56:21.076
- All right, guys, so
let's just check in.

56:21.178 --> 56:23.145
This morning, we
started so fast,

56:23.247 --> 56:24.380
we didn't even get a chance

56:24.482 --> 56:25.981
to have our normal
morning check-in.

56:26.083 --> 56:28.417
So, last night, you worked
on the shipping container,

56:28.519 --> 56:29.685
got that all organized
and thinned out,

56:29.787 --> 56:32.321
so thank you again for
spending even more time here.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.555
Yesterday was a long day,

56:33.657 --> 56:35.691
but that really will help
us with all your keep stuff.

56:35.793 --> 56:37.960
At the end of this, we have
somewhere to put it now.

56:38.062 --> 56:39.161
Okay?

56:39.263 --> 56:40.329
Dr. Tolin?
- Yeah.

56:40.431 --> 56:43.499
Well, I just wanted to see
how everybody's feeling.

56:43.601 --> 56:46.335
And in particular, I'm
interested in Tiffany and Becky.

56:46.437 --> 56:47.836
I'm interested in everybody,

56:47.938 --> 56:50.539
but what's going on
emotionally for you guys?

56:50.641 --> 56:51.640
- I'm fine.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.742
I mean, I know that
for many other people

56:53.844 --> 56:58.046
it's more traumatic, so to
speak, but I am having...

56:58.149 --> 56:58.847
It's going good for me.

56:58.949 --> 57:00.315
I'm just ready to rock and roll.

57:00.418 --> 57:01.950
- Great, great.
- And it's right.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.352
If I would feel
upset, of course,

57:03.454 --> 57:04.353
I would come to you
and talk or whatnot.

57:04.455 --> 57:05.854
- Yes, please do.
- I have no problem

57:05.956 --> 57:09.591
with that whatsoever, but, yeah.

57:09.693 --> 57:11.727
- Becky, how about
you; how you feeling?

57:13.731 --> 57:16.131
- I'm sad, mad, all of it.

57:17.968 --> 57:19.701
We need to get this done.

57:19.804 --> 57:20.369
- [David] We do.

57:20.471 --> 57:21.970
- (beep) yeah.
- We do.

57:23.574 --> 57:25.741
But also, it's important for
us to pause every now and again

57:25.843 --> 57:27.509
and check in on how you're
feeling and make sure

57:27.611 --> 57:29.812
that you're dealing with
those emotions appropriately.

57:29.914 --> 57:32.414
Can you say a little bit
more about the sad and mad?

57:33.984 --> 57:38.921
- I'm just sad at (pausing)
all the stuff, how they lived.

57:40.991 --> 57:45.994
And I'm mad they left it
all for us to clean up.

57:47.832 --> 57:49.765
I wish they coulda got
the help they needed.

57:49.867 --> 57:51.300
- Yeah, I wish they had too.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.203
If they had, maybe
we wouldn't be here

57:54.305 --> 57:55.704
having this conversation.

57:56.540 --> 57:57.406
- Yup.

57:59.009 --> 58:00.776
- So, Tiffany, some of this
stuff was yours as well.

58:00.878 --> 58:03.278
Anything that you wanna
discuss with Becky?

58:03.380 --> 58:05.380
- This will not be
the case for my place.

58:07.184 --> 58:11.653
If there's anything I am
certain of, it is that.

58:12.890 --> 58:15.057
- I won't clean your place too.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.793
- I know, I know.
- I won't.

58:17.895 --> 58:20.629
- I know, so I will
not let that happen.

58:23.267 --> 58:24.666
I know it was terrible.

58:24.768 --> 58:26.535
- It's awful, Tiffany!

58:28.305 --> 58:29.571
- Yes.

58:29.673 --> 58:30.973
- [Becky] I can't believe
you were up there!

58:31.075 --> 58:32.107
- It is, it is.

58:32.209 --> 58:35.377
- It is sad to see how
you were living, Tiffany.

58:35.479 --> 58:39.681
I'll tell ya, I really felt it
when I looked up in your room

58:39.783 --> 58:41.517
and saw where you
had been sleeping.

58:43.220 --> 58:46.822
That was really sad, and
it's a sad existence.

58:46.924 --> 58:48.757
- Mm-hmm, it is.

58:48.859 --> 58:52.861
- (weeping) It breaks my heart.

58:58.369 --> 59:00.936
(soft pensive music)

59:06.577 --> 59:09.311
- [Man] Here's
another heavy one.

59:12.149 --> 59:13.115
All right.

59:19.156 --> 59:21.023
- I got it.
- Thank you.

59:31.635 --> 59:33.335
- That (beep) on the side
that you're touching, Tony?

59:33.437 --> 59:34.303
Out.

59:36.907 --> 59:39.841
- [Jeff] I'm not trying to
force you to throw things away.

59:39.944 --> 59:40.876
- [Tiffany] No.

59:40.978 --> 59:42.344
- Okay.
- No, I'm fine.

59:42.446 --> 59:43.312
I would tell you if-

59:43.414 --> 59:44.379
I have no problem.

59:51.555 --> 59:53.422
- Becky, they were
ready to do this wall.

59:53.524 --> 59:54.222
The chute's right there.

59:54.325 --> 59:56.658
Literally, boom and it's done.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.293
And I told 'em they couldn't,

59:58.395 --> 59:59.595
but you gotta
rethink that, Becky.

59:59.697 --> 1:00:02.531
No one wants to come up here
and get these clothes, please.

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:05.133
- What are they being saved for?

1:00:05.235 --> 1:00:06.134
- [Christine] Yeah.

1:00:06.236 --> 1:00:08.570
- 'Cause I thought
they were still good.

1:00:08.672 --> 1:00:09.638
- [Cory] Good for what?

1:00:09.740 --> 1:00:11.173
- For somebody.

1:00:11.275 --> 1:00:12.240
- [Rachel] Who's somebody, Mom?

1:00:12.343 --> 1:00:13.609
- [Becky] I don't know.

1:00:13.711 --> 1:00:15.243
- So, can we?
- Mom, can we-

1:00:15.346 --> 1:00:16.511
- [Christine] Come on, Becky.

1:00:16.614 --> 1:00:18.347
- Let's talk through it, let's
talk through it, you guys.

1:00:18.449 --> 1:00:20.248
Let's not just make
her make a decision.

1:00:20.351 --> 1:00:22.517
I wanna understand why
she wants to keep them.

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:23.418
Remember, this is
all part of it.

1:00:23.621 --> 1:00:25.988
Dr. Tolin is doing
something else.

1:00:26.090 --> 1:00:27.222
So, I'm not playing
psychologist,

1:00:27.324 --> 1:00:29.057
but I just wanna understand
why you wanna keep 'em.

1:00:29.159 --> 1:00:31.960
(somber music)

1:00:32.062 --> 1:00:34.730
- This is your mother's
issue, not yours.

1:00:34.832 --> 1:00:35.564
So, why?

1:00:35.666 --> 1:00:36.898
Why do you wanna make it okay

1:00:37.001 --> 1:00:38.033
that your mother
saved these clothes?

1:00:38.135 --> 1:00:39.167
It's not okay.

1:00:39.269 --> 1:00:40.969
You could never make it okay.

1:00:43.007 --> 1:00:44.506
You could give this to someone

1:00:44.608 --> 1:00:45.707
and see 'em on the
street wearing it

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:49.111
and it's still not okay
that your mother saved them.

1:00:49.213 --> 1:00:50.746
It's not okay.

1:00:50.848 --> 1:00:52.047
- So, is it just hard for you

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:55.183
to watch your mother's hard
work go down into a trashcan?

1:00:55.886 --> 1:00:56.852
I get that.

1:00:57.855 --> 1:01:00.355
- But it's not yours.
- They're still nice.

1:01:00.457 --> 1:01:02.124
I don't know, I know.
- But they're not.

1:01:02.226 --> 1:01:04.092
Remember the rodents, the odors?

1:01:04.194 --> 1:01:05.193
There's a lot of issues

1:01:05.295 --> 1:01:06.862
with the stuff coming
outta the house, okay?

1:01:06.964 --> 1:01:07.829
- All right.

1:01:07.931 --> 1:01:09.297
- This room smells.

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:10.565
You can't smell it 'cause
you're wearing that mask,

1:01:10.668 --> 1:01:12.834
but everything in here,
these clothes, they smell.

1:01:12.936 --> 1:01:13.902
- Think of it another way.

1:01:14.004 --> 1:01:15.604
Think of it, would you
wanna go buy something

1:01:15.706 --> 1:01:17.439
that came out of a house
where rodents, squirrels,

1:01:17.541 --> 1:01:19.875
raccoons were in there.

1:01:19.977 --> 1:01:21.777
- And put it on your
daughter, would you ever?

1:01:21.879 --> 1:01:24.880
Would you wanna do that to
anyone else in the world?

1:01:24.982 --> 1:01:29.117
- Mom, think about how
we came in here, Mom.

1:01:29.219 --> 1:01:30.585
- It's just hard
for her, you guys.

1:01:30.688 --> 1:01:31.620
- Can I push you?

1:01:31.722 --> 1:01:33.422
I would love to throw this away.

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.491
- Just remember, you guys,
every time something leaves,

1:01:36.593 --> 1:01:38.593
it's like a part
of her mom leaving.

1:01:38.696 --> 1:01:40.062
That's all this is, okay?

1:01:40.164 --> 1:01:41.830
- If you're trying
to save your mom,

1:01:41.932 --> 1:01:43.165
you don't have to
save her anymore.

1:01:43.267 --> 1:01:46.234
Your mom's looking down right
now, Becky, I promise you,

1:01:46.336 --> 1:01:49.037
and she is happy that
we all are helping.

1:01:49.139 --> 1:01:51.807
She's happy Cory and his
crew came to help you.

1:01:51.909 --> 1:01:54.042
She's happy, I promise you that,

1:01:54.144 --> 1:01:58.113
'cause she had to feel
awful to leave you this.

1:01:58.215 --> 1:02:00.449
- It's not fair for us to just
yank this stuff away from you

1:02:00.551 --> 1:02:03.051
without giving you a
voice and an opinion.

1:02:04.121 --> 1:02:05.620
You gotta be able to do this.

1:02:05.723 --> 1:02:06.621
It's painful.

1:02:06.724 --> 1:02:09.825
You have to process
through this, okay?

1:02:09.927 --> 1:02:12.661
(pensive music)

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:15.897
But if you really don't wanna
let this go, don't let it go.

1:02:15.999 --> 1:02:16.932
We can revisit it.

1:02:18.702 --> 1:02:20.702
We don't wanna make
bad decisions, okay?

1:02:21.972 --> 1:02:25.373
- It's hard working through
understanding hoarding

1:02:25.476 --> 1:02:28.677
and trying not to
hoard their hoard

1:02:30.013 --> 1:02:35.784
for reasons unknown to me of
why they collected this stuff.

1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:38.820
- [Becky] All the
stuff in bags can go.

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:40.255
- [Cory] Then let's do it.

1:02:40.357 --> 1:02:41.623
- [Christine] Let's
do it, let's do it.

1:02:41.725 --> 1:02:44.893
(lighthearted music)

1:02:59.409 --> 1:03:00.142
- All right. (exhaling)

1:03:00.244 --> 1:03:01.209
Sorry.

1:03:01.311 --> 1:03:05.080
(laughing) We are making
really good progress.

1:03:05.182 --> 1:03:06.348
We needed to get access
to all these books.

1:03:06.450 --> 1:03:09.918
So, I think, for probably
the next half an hour to hour

1:03:10.020 --> 1:03:12.087
we can literally just
send the books down.

1:03:12.189 --> 1:03:14.790
But are you gonna need
to sit up here and watch

1:03:14.892 --> 1:03:16.591
or can we just take
the books down?

1:03:16.693 --> 1:03:18.059
- Do it.
- Do it?

1:03:18.162 --> 1:03:18.827
All right.

1:03:19.797 --> 1:03:20.695
Pound it.
- Appreciate it.

1:03:20.798 --> 1:03:21.496
- No problem.

1:03:21.598 --> 1:03:22.898
- [Cory] We're gonna get going.

1:03:26.336 --> 1:03:27.569
- There's a weird
discrepancy here

1:03:27.671 --> 1:03:31.406
because I know that Tiffany
has accumulated all this stuff,

1:03:31.508 --> 1:03:34.643
yet she seems so willing
to relinquish that now,

1:03:34.745 --> 1:03:37.746
and I was curious as
to what had done it.

1:03:37.848 --> 1:03:40.015
And the answer is that
she's been receiving

1:03:40.117 --> 1:03:41.983
cognitive behavioral
therapy for hoarding.

1:03:42.085 --> 1:03:43.985
- So, I've just been
waiting for this day,

1:03:44.087 --> 1:03:48.023
hoping for this day for so
long, praying about this day.

1:03:48.125 --> 1:03:52.093
And it's here, so I'm just
grateful beyond belief.

1:03:52.196 --> 1:03:53.161
- So, you've already done

1:03:53.263 --> 1:03:54.896
a lotta the emotional
prep work, basically.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:56.031
You've already kinda
prepared yourself for this,

1:03:56.133 --> 1:03:58.934
and now this is just the
physical getting it out.

1:03:59.036 --> 1:04:00.735
- Right, exactly.
- That's great.

1:04:00.838 --> 1:04:03.038
And it really shows
that you can get help

1:04:03.140 --> 1:04:04.840
and that you can
make a big change

1:04:04.942 --> 1:04:07.542
if you're motivated to do so
and if you find the right help.

1:04:07.644 --> 1:04:10.212
- [Tiffany] We're
going to the tent.

1:04:10.314 --> 1:04:11.413
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1:04:30.868 --> 1:04:32.968
- So, Tiffany, we have a
bunch of art supplies here

1:04:33.070 --> 1:04:34.135
and a bunch over there.

1:04:34.238 --> 1:04:35.403
This is obviously
not all of them.

1:04:35.505 --> 1:04:37.072
There's still more upstairs,

1:04:37.174 --> 1:04:38.707
but they are still
pulling out books,

1:04:38.809 --> 1:04:40.809
so we can't quite
get to them just yet.

1:04:40.911 --> 1:04:42.444
But I wonder if we
could start making

1:04:42.546 --> 1:04:44.045
some decisions here.
- Sure.

1:04:44.147 --> 1:04:45.547
- To frame our discussion,

1:04:46.950 --> 1:04:48.750
yesterday you
looked at some paint

1:04:48.852 --> 1:04:50.151
and you said you
wanted to keep it

1:04:50.254 --> 1:04:52.721
and let the rest of
the stuff upstairs go.

1:04:52.823 --> 1:04:54.122
This might be enough
paint for you.

1:04:54.224 --> 1:04:55.156
- Yeah.
- Are you saying

1:04:55.259 --> 1:04:56.424
the rest of it could go?

1:04:56.526 --> 1:04:57.726
- [Tiffany] Yes.

1:04:57.828 --> 1:04:58.593
- Okay.

1:04:59.496 --> 1:05:00.629
So, tell me what you're thinking

1:05:00.731 --> 1:05:01.830
as you look at all
this stuff here.

1:05:01.932 --> 1:05:04.933
- I don't mean to sound
like an excuse on this part,

1:05:05.035 --> 1:05:08.837
but that's all the
acrylic paint I want,

1:05:08.939 --> 1:05:11.273
and then there's also
watercolor paints.

1:05:11.375 --> 1:05:12.908
- So, you wanna save
some watercolors,

1:05:13.010 --> 1:05:14.476
you wanna save some acrylics.

1:05:14.578 --> 1:05:15.610
Okay, so let's go through

1:05:15.712 --> 1:05:18.213
and let's have you fill
one tub with watercolor

1:05:18.315 --> 1:05:19.848
and one tub with acrylic.
- Okay.

1:05:19.950 --> 1:05:23.251
- And then maybe we can
let Carolina take the rest.

1:05:23.353 --> 1:05:24.886
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

1:05:24.988 --> 1:05:27.555
(pensive music)

1:05:27.658 --> 1:05:30.158
All right, we're getting close
to filling up this tub here.

1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:32.394
- Yes.
- What about crayons?

1:05:32.496 --> 1:05:33.595
- Those I want to keep.

1:05:33.697 --> 1:05:37.799
- You did have two full
things like this of pencils.

1:05:37.901 --> 1:05:38.600
- And then these are different

1:05:38.702 --> 1:05:40.368
'cause these are graphic tint.

1:05:40.470 --> 1:05:42.537
And I know, once
again, different...

1:05:42.639 --> 1:05:44.439
I am saving these.

1:05:44.541 --> 1:05:46.274
- Now, remember, I
just wanna remind you

1:05:46.376 --> 1:05:49.210
that we wanna have enough
stuff for you to do art,

1:05:49.313 --> 1:05:51.012
but not so much that
it clutters you up

1:05:51.114 --> 1:05:51.746
and prevents you from doing art.

1:05:51.848 --> 1:05:52.747
- [Tiffany] Right, right.

1:05:52.849 --> 1:05:54.249
- Are we still on
track to do that?

1:05:54.351 --> 1:05:55.216
- [Tiffany] I believe so.

1:05:55.319 --> 1:05:58.820
- You're keeping
about 70% right now.

1:05:58.922 --> 1:06:02.057
So, if you can bring
that down some,

1:06:02.159 --> 1:06:04.826
keep it to 25% or 30%?

1:06:04.928 --> 1:06:06.294
'Cause I know it's your thing.

1:06:06.396 --> 1:06:09.230
- I would like to keep
these clay-shaping tools.

1:06:09.333 --> 1:06:11.466
Okay.
- Now, these are watercolors.

1:06:11.568 --> 1:06:13.134
Now, you've already got a
full tub of watercolors here.

1:06:13.236 --> 1:06:15.770
- Right, right.
- Overflowing.

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:17.973
- One concern that I
have about tomorrow

1:06:18.075 --> 1:06:20.475
is there's still an awful
lot of stuff upstairs.

1:06:20.577 --> 1:06:22.911
And I'm just concerned that
we're not gonna have enough time

1:06:23.013 --> 1:06:24.079
to get rid of it all.

1:06:24.181 --> 1:06:26.514
I'm also concerned that
Tiffany is gonna fall back

1:06:26.616 --> 1:06:28.783
into wanting to save
some of the art supplies,

1:06:28.885 --> 1:06:30.719
so I'll wanna watch for that.

1:06:30.821 --> 1:06:31.886
- [Tiffany] Oh,
is that beautiful.

1:06:31.989 --> 1:06:33.822
- So, this is what really
gets to you, right?

1:06:33.924 --> 1:06:35.790
It's beautiful, it's colorful,

1:06:35.892 --> 1:06:37.726
and it's all the
things that represent

1:06:37.828 --> 1:06:39.494
what you wanna be doing.
- Right.

1:06:39.596 --> 1:06:41.763
- And yet we know you've
got too much of it.

1:06:41.865 --> 1:06:42.597
- Right.

1:06:42.699 --> 1:06:44.299
- So, what do you wanna do?

1:06:53.643 --> 1:06:55.677
(soft pensive music)

1:07:06.323 --> 1:07:07.155
- [Cory] Good morning, you guys.

1:07:07.257 --> 1:07:07.989
- [All] Morning!

1:07:08.091 --> 1:07:09.824
- We made it to the last day.

1:07:09.926 --> 1:07:11.593
So, we're doing the
final push today

1:07:11.695 --> 1:07:13.395
to clear out your two rooms.

1:07:13.497 --> 1:07:14.963
All the books are out.
- Wow, amazing.

1:07:15.065 --> 1:07:16.264
- So, the rest is clothing

1:07:16.366 --> 1:07:17.465
and we might need
some help up there

1:07:17.567 --> 1:07:18.566
just making some
decisions, okay?

1:07:18.668 --> 1:07:20.702
- Sure, sure.
- Well, how you feeling today?

1:07:20.804 --> 1:07:22.203
- Great.
- Yeah?

1:07:22.305 --> 1:07:25.240
- I don't know if that's
a word you get often, but-

1:07:25.342 --> 1:07:26.908
- Not a lot.
- Okay.

1:07:27.010 --> 1:07:28.376
I truly do.

1:07:28.478 --> 1:07:30.645
So, the books that
we took out of here,

1:07:30.747 --> 1:07:34.716
I, yes, had a panic and
was very sad about that.

1:07:34.818 --> 1:07:35.550
- You were sad about the books?

1:07:35.652 --> 1:07:37.786
- I was sad about the books.

1:07:37.888 --> 1:07:39.120
I'm fine with it.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:42.023
- You feel okay now?
- I do feel okay.

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:43.825
It's shocking.

1:07:43.927 --> 1:07:47.929
Tiffany two years ago,
Tiffany five years ago, 10,

1:07:48.031 --> 1:07:50.799
would have been so
shocked and, yeah,

1:07:50.901 --> 1:07:52.100
I'm just absolutely
fine with it.

1:07:52.202 --> 1:07:54.869
- I think there's maybe two
lessons to be learned from this.

1:07:54.971 --> 1:07:57.038
One is that it seems
like it's really clear

1:07:57.140 --> 1:07:59.140
that therapy for hoarding
disorder really works.

1:07:59.242 --> 1:08:00.608
- Yes.
- And it really helps.

1:08:00.710 --> 1:08:02.377
- Yes.
- Which is terrific.

1:08:02.479 --> 1:08:04.846
The other thing that I think
is important to recognize

1:08:04.948 --> 1:08:06.114
is that you were mentioning

1:08:06.216 --> 1:08:08.716
that you were originally feeling
sad and now you feel fine.

1:08:08.819 --> 1:08:09.984
And that's important
to recognize

1:08:10.087 --> 1:08:13.288
is that emotions tend to go
up and then they come down.

1:08:13.390 --> 1:08:15.590
And if we can just
hang in there,

1:08:15.692 --> 1:08:16.891
it comes down on the other side.

1:08:16.993 --> 1:08:18.026
I mean, a lotta the time

1:08:18.128 --> 1:08:19.160
as we're ramping up with
an emotion, we feel like,

1:08:19.262 --> 1:08:20.628
"Oh my god, I'm
gonna feel this way

1:08:20.730 --> 1:08:21.930
"for the rest of my life."

1:08:22.032 --> 1:08:23.231
But the fact of the matter is

1:08:23.333 --> 1:08:24.399
you're not gonna feel that
way for the rest of your life.

1:08:24.501 --> 1:08:26.334
You're gonna feel
that way for a while

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:28.136
and then it starts to come
down on the other side

1:08:28.238 --> 1:08:29.537
and it's not so bad.

1:08:29.639 --> 1:08:30.271
- Right.

1:08:30.373 --> 1:08:31.873
Wisdom again from you.

1:08:31.975 --> 1:08:33.808
I mean, truly, it is.

1:08:34.911 --> 1:08:35.944
I am fine.

1:08:36.046 --> 1:08:38.680
- And I have a benefit
of your letting go.

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:40.782
We got your money today.
- Okay!

1:08:40.884 --> 1:08:42.750
- See, there's your trade off.
- Thank you!

1:08:42.853 --> 1:08:44.919
- There's your first payment
toward your new house.

1:08:45.021 --> 1:08:47.288
- Yes, thank you very much.
- Not the bookstore.

1:08:47.390 --> 1:08:48.957
- Yes, no, no.

1:08:49.059 --> 1:08:50.558
- Becky, let me check in on you.

1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:52.227
How are you feeling
this morning?

1:08:53.597 --> 1:08:55.663
- I am ecstatic
about the progress

1:08:55.765 --> 1:08:57.899
that's been made in the house,

1:08:59.436 --> 1:09:00.969
nervous that we
won't get through

1:09:01.071 --> 1:09:02.604
those other two bedrooms.

1:09:02.706 --> 1:09:03.605
- It's a lot to do still.

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:06.241
- 'Cause I know
what it means for me

1:09:06.343 --> 1:09:08.643
is I'm left to do the rest.

1:09:08.745 --> 1:09:11.446
But if we can make it
through those two bedrooms,

1:09:11.548 --> 1:09:13.548
I feel like I can make
it through the rest then.

1:09:13.650 --> 1:09:14.649
- [David] Yeah, yeah.

1:09:14.751 --> 1:09:17.652
- And end this chapter.

1:09:17.754 --> 1:09:18.887
- [David] Let me check
in with Rachel and Jeff.

1:09:18.989 --> 1:09:20.255
How do you think
things are going?

1:09:20.357 --> 1:09:22.490
- I think those
things are going good.

1:09:22.592 --> 1:09:24.959
I hope to get the two
bedrooms done today.

1:09:25.061 --> 1:09:25.927
- [David] I do too.

1:09:26.029 --> 1:09:27.562
- [Cory] Oh, they're
gonna get done.

1:09:27.664 --> 1:09:28.663
Have faith.

1:09:29.900 --> 1:09:32.066
We're not leaving 'til they're
done, unless you stop us.

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:34.569
- No, you will not
be stopped by me.

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:35.570
- [David] Jeff how about you?

1:09:35.672 --> 1:09:37.672
- I'm feeling great
about the progress.

1:09:37.774 --> 1:09:41.709
I'm so happy that
this is happening.

1:09:42.979 --> 1:09:44.846
- And last, let me hear
from Chris and Christine.

1:09:44.948 --> 1:09:47.081
How do you guys think that
Tiffany and Becky are doing

1:09:47.184 --> 1:09:50.685
with letting go of stuff
and making progress?

1:09:50.787 --> 1:09:52.887
- We think that they're
doing fantastic.

1:09:54.224 --> 1:09:58.826
Our objective has always been
to just fully support them

1:09:59.362 --> 1:10:00.929
and be behind them.

1:10:01.031 --> 1:10:03.064
And we just wanna see a
much better life for them,

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:06.901
and we're just really happy
with the progress at this point.

1:10:08.338 --> 1:10:11.372
- It makes me sad that
you've had to live like this,

1:10:11.474 --> 1:10:13.875
Tiffany, I'm sorry, okay?
- Yeah, no!

1:10:14.544 --> 1:10:15.577
I survived.

1:10:15.679 --> 1:10:17.512
- No one should have
to live like this.

1:10:17.614 --> 1:10:20.815
- Yes, it is terrible.
- No more of it.

1:10:20.917 --> 1:10:22.550
- Right, I came out
on the other side.

1:10:22.652 --> 1:10:23.518
- [Chris] That's right.

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:25.386
- That's the only
reason we're here, okay,

1:10:25.488 --> 1:10:27.488
is 'cause no one should
have to live like this.

1:10:27.591 --> 1:10:29.891
- Yes, yes.

1:10:29.993 --> 1:10:31.559
Thank you, yes.

1:10:31.661 --> 1:10:33.161
Understood.

1:10:33.263 --> 1:10:34.629
Mm-hmm.

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:35.897
- [Cory] And she
never will again.

1:10:35.999 --> 1:10:36.898
- [Tiffany] Nope.

1:10:38.168 --> 1:10:40.501
- All right, well, our crew
has been at it all morning.

1:10:40.604 --> 1:10:42.403
We're gonna continue going.

1:10:42.505 --> 1:10:44.539
We need you guys to
continue sorting.

1:10:44.641 --> 1:10:47.041
I think you guys have
some more art supplies

1:10:47.143 --> 1:10:48.476
and paints and stuff
to work through.

1:10:48.578 --> 1:10:50.545
We just raised the floor jacks

1:10:50.647 --> 1:10:53.014
and everything's
great this morning.

1:10:53.116 --> 1:10:54.515
Honestly, I think, with
how much we removed,

1:10:54.618 --> 1:10:56.417
I don't even have a
concern with that anymore.

1:10:56.519 --> 1:10:59.354
Those three cracked joists
are being held up just fine.

1:10:59.456 --> 1:11:00.989
So, anyone that wants
to come up and help,

1:11:01.091 --> 1:11:01.856
we'll see you up there.

1:11:01.958 --> 1:11:03.091
- Sounds good!
- Awesome.

1:11:03.193 --> 1:11:04.926
- All right, let's do it.
- Great, let's do it!

1:11:05.028 --> 1:11:05.860
Thank you!

1:11:05.962 --> 1:11:06.694
Woo-hoo!

1:11:06.796 --> 1:11:09.430
(pensive music)

1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:13.701
All the clothing in that
room you're in, buh-bye.

1:11:16.072 --> 1:11:18.239
Oh, look at, there's marbles
I'm gonna get rid of.

1:11:18.341 --> 1:11:19.240
(Cory laughing)

1:11:19.342 --> 1:11:21.142
- You're losing your marbles?
- Yes.

1:11:22.612 --> 1:11:24.245
Everything can go.

1:11:28.184 --> 1:11:30.184
I couldn't reach, I can't
see, and I don't know

1:11:30.287 --> 1:11:32.553
what the hell is up on the
top shelf in the closet,

1:11:32.656 --> 1:11:33.588
and I don't care.

1:11:42.165 --> 1:11:44.932
(trash clattering)

1:11:45.035 --> 1:11:47.702
(pensive music)

1:11:55.145 --> 1:11:55.810
Junk.

1:11:57.580 --> 1:11:58.646
- [David] Great, Tiffany.

1:11:58.748 --> 1:12:00.782
- This can all go
out, and those,

1:12:00.884 --> 1:12:02.850
and that's gouache, and wash.

1:12:02.952 --> 1:12:03.885
- [David] And the rest can go?

1:12:03.987 --> 1:12:05.153
- Yes.
- Okay.

1:12:05.255 --> 1:12:08.289
At the sorting table, Tiffany
is really surprising me.

1:12:08.391 --> 1:12:11.326
She is going through and
getting rid of stuff.

1:12:11.428 --> 1:12:15.296
I'd say probably 75%-80%
of the art supplies

1:12:15.398 --> 1:12:17.365
that we put in front of
her she's letting go of.

1:12:17.467 --> 1:12:18.533
- [Tiffany] I feel
comfortable with that.

1:12:18.635 --> 1:12:20.168
- [David] You feel like
you could let 'em go?

1:12:20.270 --> 1:12:21.636
- Yeah.
- All right, great.

1:12:21.738 --> 1:12:23.371
This is really great progress

1:12:23.473 --> 1:12:25.206
because it's
important to recognize

1:12:25.308 --> 1:12:27.642
that it's not about the things.

1:12:27.744 --> 1:12:29.077
You can pursue your passion

1:12:29.179 --> 1:12:31.212
without collecting
all that stuff.

1:12:31.314 --> 1:12:34.282
- [Tiffany] If you wanna put
it in the garbage, that's fine.

1:12:34.384 --> 1:12:37.085
(pensive music)

1:12:41.591 --> 1:12:42.290
- Hey, guys.

1:12:42.392 --> 1:12:43.391
- Hey, hey.
- How ya doing?

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:44.592
Thanks for coming, I'm Cory.
- Will.

1:12:44.694 --> 1:12:45.860
Will?
- Hey, Cory.

1:12:45.962 --> 1:12:47.662
- Jake.
- Jake, nice to meet you.

1:12:47.764 --> 1:12:49.764
So, (laughing) starting
at the beginning.

1:12:49.866 --> 1:12:51.432
This house was
really full of stuff.

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:53.668
We've removed about
12 dumpsters full.

1:12:53.770 --> 1:12:55.303
There's still a lot
more that you'll see.

1:12:55.405 --> 1:12:56.504
Not sure if the family's
gonna do that or not,

1:12:56.606 --> 1:12:59.507
but what we're trying to do
is just get an evaluation

1:12:59.609 --> 1:13:01.642
on what the house is
worth in this condition,

1:13:01.745 --> 1:13:04.645
kinda so they know if they
can move forward and fix it.

1:13:04.748 --> 1:13:08.015
Or if you make an offer, if
that's something you guys do,

1:13:08.118 --> 1:13:09.484
maybe they'll just
accept it and walk away.

1:13:09.586 --> 1:13:10.685
We really don't know.

1:13:12.021 --> 1:13:13.187
So, just so you guys know,

1:13:13.289 --> 1:13:14.422
this house had so
much stuff in it

1:13:14.524 --> 1:13:16.624
that we had three cracked
floor joists in the basement,

1:13:16.726 --> 1:13:18.593
so we have that jacked
up right now temporarily

1:13:18.695 --> 1:13:20.094
until those can be fixed.

1:13:20.196 --> 1:13:21.896
And some the ceilings,
walls have cracks in 'em.

1:13:21.998 --> 1:13:24.465
I mean, this house was
literally busting at the seams.

1:13:24.567 --> 1:13:25.633
So, we've taken a
lotta weight out.

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:28.202
We've kept adjusting the
jacks in the basement,

1:13:28.304 --> 1:13:29.370
so it's pretty secure now,

1:13:29.472 --> 1:13:31.472
especially since we
removed all this tonnage.

1:13:31.574 --> 1:13:33.241
So, just take a look at
the structural stuff too,

1:13:33.343 --> 1:13:35.510
just so you're aware that
that needs to be included

1:13:35.612 --> 1:13:36.711
in this quote.

1:13:36.813 --> 1:13:38.446
So, you guys wanna take a
look and see what you think?

1:13:38.548 --> 1:13:39.447
- Cool, cool.
- Absolutely.

1:13:39.549 --> 1:13:40.848
- [Cory] Okay, perfect;
thanks, you guys.

1:13:40.950 --> 1:13:43.618
(pensive music)

1:13:54.197 --> 1:13:55.930
- [Jake] Some black mold.

1:13:56.032 --> 1:13:57.865
- [Will] Little water
damage, probably roof.

1:13:59.269 --> 1:14:00.168
Again, if there's structural
issues, they'd be up there.

1:14:00.270 --> 1:14:02.503
There'd be a crack
over here too as well.

1:14:03.473 --> 1:14:05.773
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

1:14:09.646 --> 1:14:10.878
- [Jake] Whoa!

1:14:11.815 --> 1:14:13.514
- [Will] Check out the basement.

1:14:14.884 --> 1:14:16.818
- It's so sad when you work
so hard and you have a hoarder

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:19.120
willing to get rid of
pretty much everything

1:14:19.222 --> 1:14:20.788
and the house looks
like it does at the end.

1:14:20.890 --> 1:14:22.790
The good news is she wasn't
planning on living there anyway,

1:14:22.892 --> 1:14:24.859
so hopefully she can get
some money and move on.

1:14:24.961 --> 1:14:28.763
(rising suspenseful music)

1:14:28.865 --> 1:14:29.764
- [Jake] Wow.

1:14:34.304 --> 1:14:36.671
(soft pensive music)

1:14:40.076 --> 1:14:43.010
- [Will] Whoa!
(Will laughing)

1:14:43.112 --> 1:14:44.479
There's support issues.

1:14:44.581 --> 1:14:45.346
- [Jake] Big job.

1:14:45.448 --> 1:14:48.282
(tense, pulsing music)

1:14:53.723 --> 1:14:55.656
- [Will] Wow, this is crazy.

1:14:56.493 --> 1:14:57.425
(Cory buzzing)

1:14:57.527 --> 1:14:59.460
- [Cory] Bye, hornets nest.

1:14:59.562 --> 1:15:01.429
- [Will] I've seen
what I needed to see.

1:15:01.531 --> 1:15:05.066
(rising suspenseful music)

1:15:13.643 --> 1:15:16.544
(soft piano music)

1:15:24.053 --> 1:15:25.686
- Oh, wow, wow, wow.

1:15:25.788 --> 1:15:27.588
- Look at it in here.
- Whoa.

1:15:31.828 --> 1:15:34.128
You can tap dance in here.
- Yeah.

1:15:35.398 --> 1:15:38.599
- [Tiffany] You couldn't
before, that's for doggone sure.

1:15:38.701 --> 1:15:41.035
- Hi there.
- Hi!

1:15:41.137 --> 1:15:41.936
Wow.

1:15:45.708 --> 1:15:46.741
This is amazing.

1:15:48.912 --> 1:15:50.378
- So, Tiffany, tell
me what you think

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:52.547
when you walk
through this house?

1:15:52.649 --> 1:15:55.883
- First of all, this
is a huge house,

1:15:55.985 --> 1:16:00.755
and I have not felt that
way in forever and a day.

1:16:00.857 --> 1:16:02.990
And I'm just so glad.

1:16:03.092 --> 1:16:06.661
And I think that our parents

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:11.332
in heaven have something to
do with this and other forces,

1:16:11.434 --> 1:16:14.201
and I think that
they're very thrilled

1:16:14.304 --> 1:16:15.236
with how this has gone.

1:16:15.338 --> 1:16:16.971
And proud.
- You think they'd be happy?

1:16:17.073 --> 1:16:18.372
- Oh yeah.

1:16:18.474 --> 1:16:21.742
Yeah, I think they
probably felt bad

1:16:21.844 --> 1:16:23.044
that they couldn't
do it on their own,

1:16:23.146 --> 1:16:26.414
and I think they're ecstatic
and proud of Becky and I

1:16:26.516 --> 1:16:31.052
and how we have done
this, so all of us, yeah.

1:16:31.154 --> 1:16:33.187
- Becky, how are you doing?

1:16:33.289 --> 1:16:35.089
- It's unbelievable
that there are 10 of us

1:16:35.191 --> 1:16:36.390
standing in this room.

1:16:36.492 --> 1:16:38.159
(all laughing)

1:16:38.261 --> 1:16:41.629
Couldn't even fit 10 people
in this house before.

1:16:41.731 --> 1:16:44.231
- I remember coming in the
first time with you, Tiffany,

1:16:44.334 --> 1:16:46.701
and I don't think we could get
into this room at all, right?

1:16:46.803 --> 1:16:48.102
- [Tiffany] Right.

1:16:48.204 --> 1:16:49.604
- [David] This was
completely blocked off.

1:16:49.706 --> 1:16:50.838
- [Tiffany] Mm-hmm.

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:53.841
- And Rachel, how about you?

1:16:53.943 --> 1:16:57.211
- I feel great; I can hear our
voices echoing in the house.

1:16:57.313 --> 1:16:58.846
(all laughing)
- Yep.

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:01.148
- I can hear myself think.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:17:01.250 --> 1:17:02.583
And when the house is cluttered,

1:17:02.685 --> 1:17:03.951
it's hard to think, isn't it?

1:17:04.053 --> 1:17:04.919
- Yeah.

1:17:05.822 --> 1:17:07.955
I think the whole
process went very well

1:17:08.057 --> 1:17:09.957
and we did a lot of stuff

1:17:10.059 --> 1:17:13.527
that we wouldn't have been
able to have done on our own.

1:17:13.630 --> 1:17:15.162
We would've never
been able to do this.

1:17:15.264 --> 1:17:18.633
And if we would've, it
would've taken so many years.

1:17:22.772 --> 1:17:24.138
- I just wanna say thank you.

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:27.241
You guys all worked
so hard, everyone did.

1:17:27.343 --> 1:17:30.911
And it's just rare to see
everyone working this hard

1:17:31.014 --> 1:17:33.581
to remove, 60 tons
was our total weight,

1:17:33.683 --> 1:17:36.984
60 tons of trash
outta this house.

1:17:37.086 --> 1:17:38.252
- Wow.

1:17:38.354 --> 1:17:39.587
I appreciate it.

1:17:39.689 --> 1:17:44.692
- This process has
given us a huge start

1:17:45.228 --> 1:17:47.028
and a means to an end.

1:17:47.130 --> 1:17:52.066
I can feel the 60 tons
lift off my shoulders

1:17:52.502 --> 1:17:54.068
quite literally.

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:55.536
It's just a huge relief.

1:17:56.673 --> 1:17:59.340
- [Jeff] I can't believe the
house was still standing.

1:18:00.510 --> 1:18:02.710
- It was barely still
standing, (laughing) literally.

1:18:02.812 --> 1:18:03.878
I mean, you could see the damage

1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:05.112
in every room of this house,

1:18:05.214 --> 1:18:06.247
in the floor joists, everywhere.

1:18:06.349 --> 1:18:07.314
So, we're just thankful

1:18:07.417 --> 1:18:11.052
that you didn't get
trapped in here or worse.

1:18:11.154 --> 1:18:13.320
We see those stories
all the time.

1:18:13.423 --> 1:18:15.089
- Cory, you and your
team have been awesome

1:18:15.191 --> 1:18:18.025
and they worked
very hard every day.

1:18:18.127 --> 1:18:20.327
I mean, I can't believe the
dedication that they had

1:18:20.430 --> 1:18:21.629
to helping us out.

1:18:21.731 --> 1:18:24.665
- They love helping people or
they wouldn't be doing this.

1:18:24.767 --> 1:18:28.669
- Cleaning out the
house was a huge step

1:18:28.771 --> 1:18:31.172
in our grieving process.

1:18:31.274 --> 1:18:33.607
It made me feel a lot better.

1:18:33.710 --> 1:18:37.078
It made me feel like
I'm on to my new life,

1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:39.847
and that's fantastic.

1:18:39.949 --> 1:18:42.717
- So, we brought a
couple people over

1:18:42.819 --> 1:18:44.552
just to evaluate the
house and give you an idea

1:18:44.654 --> 1:18:46.020
of what the property was worth

1:18:46.122 --> 1:18:47.488
in the condition it's in, okay?

1:18:47.590 --> 1:18:48.756
- I'm Jake.

1:18:48.858 --> 1:18:49.557
- Will.

1:18:49.659 --> 1:18:50.758
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you guys.

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:52.159
- This is what we do.

1:18:52.261 --> 1:18:54.328
We buy houses that
need some love.

1:18:54.430 --> 1:18:56.230
We walked around the property.

1:18:56.332 --> 1:18:58.065
Obviously, there's
a lot to do here.

1:18:58.167 --> 1:18:59.467
There is a lotta work.

1:19:00.803 --> 1:19:02.470
That being said, we can do it

1:19:02.572 --> 1:19:04.105
and we'd be willing
to purchase the house

1:19:04.207 --> 1:19:07.708
if that is something you
guys would be looking to do.

1:19:07.810 --> 1:19:08.676
- So, your offer is gonna be

1:19:08.778 --> 1:19:11.545
with the remaining
contents or without?

1:19:11.647 --> 1:19:12.613
- With, as is.

1:19:12.715 --> 1:19:15.015
Anything they wanna
leave we'll take care of.

1:19:15.118 --> 1:19:17.151
If there's stuff that you need
to get out or need help with,

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:18.619
we are also willing
to help you with that.

1:19:18.721 --> 1:19:20.554
So, we would like to
make you an offer,

1:19:20.656 --> 1:19:23.257
if that's something you
guys wanna entertain.

1:19:23.359 --> 1:19:25.626
- [Becky] Yes, certainly
willing to listen.

1:19:25.728 --> 1:19:28.362
I'm sure we can't make any
decisions at this point,

1:19:28.464 --> 1:19:29.997
but yes.
- Absolutely.

1:19:30.099 --> 1:19:31.098
Where we would be at

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.767
with the amount of work
we think this needs,

1:19:32.869 --> 1:19:35.069
we'd be somewhere
around $70,000 cash.

1:19:36.439 --> 1:19:39.507
That would be as is,

1:19:40.843 --> 1:19:43.344
cash offer, close as soon
as you guys can close,

1:19:43.446 --> 1:19:46.413
and that's about
where we would be.

1:19:46.516 --> 1:19:47.581
Okay?
- Okay.

1:19:48.818 --> 1:19:50.317
Yeah, if we could think about
that, yeah, that'd be great.

1:19:50.419 --> 1:19:51.619
- [Jake] Okay, absolutely.

1:19:51.721 --> 1:19:52.686
- [Tiffany] Okay.

1:19:52.789 --> 1:19:53.754
- We can be in contact
and we'll go from there?

1:19:53.856 --> 1:19:55.890
- Yeah, that'd be fantastic.
- Great.

1:19:55.992 --> 1:19:56.690
- [Jeff] Thank you.

1:19:56.793 --> 1:19:57.725
- [Tiffany] Thank you very much.

1:19:57.827 --> 1:19:58.659
- [Jake] All right,
thank you, guys.

1:19:58.761 --> 1:19:59.794
- [David] Appreciate you guys.

1:19:59.896 --> 1:20:00.594
- [Cory] Yeah, thanks
for coming out.

1:20:00.696 --> 1:20:01.729
- [Jake] Absolutely.

1:20:01.831 --> 1:20:03.297
- So, it's something
to think about.

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:05.800
I do like the fact that
they'll get things out for you,

1:20:05.902 --> 1:20:09.270
all the things that you do want
as they're cleaning it out.

1:20:09.372 --> 1:20:10.404
I don't know what you
thought it was worth.

1:20:10.506 --> 1:20:13.107
I have no idea what it's
worth, but think about it.

1:20:13.209 --> 1:20:17.411
All we want is to see you guys
succeed and live a safe life.

1:20:17.513 --> 1:20:20.181
(soft piano music)

1:20:20.283 --> 1:20:23.083
- There's a lotta discussion
that's gonna have to go on,

1:20:23.186 --> 1:20:24.652
what we're gonna do.

1:20:24.754 --> 1:20:27.421
We do have an
offer on the table,

1:20:27.523 --> 1:20:29.123
but that's something
that Becky and Tiffany

1:20:29.225 --> 1:20:31.258
have to sit down and hash out.

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:32.893
But there's a light at
the end of the tunnel

1:20:32.995 --> 1:20:34.762
and we see it now.

1:20:34.864 --> 1:20:36.764
- One of the things
that I wanna talk about

1:20:36.866 --> 1:20:38.065
is the issue of aftercare

1:20:38.167 --> 1:20:41.368
because this is partly the
story of cleaning out a house,

1:20:41.470 --> 1:20:43.971
but this is also a story
about changing behavior.

1:20:44.073 --> 1:20:44.738
And I think that's the piece

1:20:44.841 --> 1:20:46.373
that we really need to watch for

1:20:46.475 --> 1:20:48.175
is that hopefully over the time

1:20:48.277 --> 1:20:49.476
that we've been working together

1:20:49.579 --> 1:20:52.580
you've been able to work on
your decision-making process.

1:20:52.682 --> 1:20:55.449
And hopefully that is
going to serve you well

1:20:55.551 --> 1:20:56.584
going forward in the future.

1:20:56.686 --> 1:20:59.086
'Cause the trick is
you're gonna be moving now

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:02.690
into a new home next to Becky's,

1:21:02.792 --> 1:21:03.757
but the trick is making sure

1:21:03.860 --> 1:21:05.693
that you don't clutter
that one up as well.

1:21:05.795 --> 1:21:08.629
So, I know you're in
some counseling now

1:21:08.731 --> 1:21:11.298
and I'm offering a
hoarding expert for you

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:12.867
if that's something
that you wanna try-

1:21:12.969 --> 1:21:14.068
- Yes, please.

1:21:14.170 --> 1:21:15.236
- But I think it's
really important

1:21:15.338 --> 1:21:17.738
that you keep working on
this, even after we're gone.

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:18.806
- Mm-hmm.

1:21:18.908 --> 1:21:20.507
I'm definitely gonna use
the aftercare therapy.

1:21:20.610 --> 1:21:23.010
That was a very
generous offer made

1:21:23.112 --> 1:21:26.780
and I truly appreciate it
and I think it will help me

1:21:26.883 --> 1:21:29.717
to develop even more skills,
and that's fantastic.

1:21:31.087 --> 1:21:33.954
I just have a little
words to say to you two.

1:21:34.056 --> 1:21:34.889
- Oh.
- Sure.

1:21:34.991 --> 1:21:35.689
- Please.
- Awesome.

1:21:35.791 --> 1:21:36.957
- Yes.

1:21:37.059 --> 1:21:40.928
Dr. Tolin, you have been
wonderful, so wise, thoughtful,

1:21:41.030 --> 1:21:43.864
and there's a reason why you
are an expert in your field.

1:21:43.966 --> 1:21:45.799
I love all these
thoughts that you said,

1:21:45.902 --> 1:21:47.101
little nuggets of wisdom

1:21:47.203 --> 1:21:49.904
that helped me think about
it in a different way.

1:21:50.006 --> 1:21:54.708
And I totally love your
gentle, supportive manner.

1:21:54.810 --> 1:21:57.878
Chef's kiss. (laughing)

1:21:57.980 --> 1:22:01.081
Cory, thank you for
wanting to do this project.

1:22:01.183 --> 1:22:03.550
Your enthusiasm and
passion for helping people

1:22:03.653 --> 1:22:04.852
came across every day.

1:22:04.954 --> 1:22:08.789
You care very much about our
wellbeing, and that's amazing.

1:22:08.891 --> 1:22:11.659
The support from my family
has been beyond words.

1:22:11.761 --> 1:22:12.860
Christine has always been

1:22:12.962 --> 1:22:15.062
an enthusiastic,
positive go-getter,

1:22:15.164 --> 1:22:17.231
so she applied
this to helping me.

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:19.833
And I'm sure it was
very overwhelming

1:22:19.936 --> 1:22:21.035
for her and Christopher

1:22:21.137 --> 1:22:23.304
'cause they haven't
been in here for years,

1:22:23.406 --> 1:22:26.140
and I think it was so
brave of them to come.

1:22:26.242 --> 1:22:29.109
And Rachel is the bravest
young adult I know,

1:22:29.211 --> 1:22:31.412
who is wise beyond her years.

1:22:31.514 --> 1:22:33.781
No one builds a
castle overnight,

1:22:35.117 --> 1:22:39.553
but, however, look at the
Amish with their barn-raising.

1:22:39.655 --> 1:22:41.822
It took a family,
it took a group,

1:22:41.924 --> 1:22:43.290
and that's what we have here.

1:22:43.392 --> 1:22:44.558
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you.

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:46.393
- Amen.
- Thank you, Tiffany.

1:22:46.495 --> 1:22:47.695
- [Cory] Thanks for writing it.

1:22:47.797 --> 1:22:48.729
- [Tiffany] Thank you.

1:22:48.831 --> 1:22:50.731
- [Cory] All right,
you guys, give it up.

1:22:50.833 --> 1:22:51.966
- [Tiffany] Oh, you betcha.

1:22:52.068 --> 1:22:53.233
- Good job, you guys.
- Thank you.

1:22:53.336 --> 1:22:54.501
- [David] I think it was great
working with you, Tiffany.

1:22:54.603 --> 1:22:56.203
- [Tiffany] Great working
with you too, Dr. Tolin.

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:58.472
- Best of luck to you.
- Thank you.

1:22:58.574 --> 1:23:03.510
- I'm ecstatic (pausing)
to see Tiffany realize

1:23:04.580 --> 1:23:07.381
what it is like to
live independently.

1:23:07.483 --> 1:23:09.183
- [David] It was good
working with you.

1:23:09.285 --> 1:23:10.451
See you later.

1:23:10.553 --> 1:23:13.253
- [Cory] Now we're
BFFs. (laughing)

1:23:13.356 --> 1:23:16.223
- Once she gains
that independence,

1:23:18.394 --> 1:23:21.362
there can only be
great things to come.

1:23:21.464 --> 1:23:22.196
- [David] Okay.

1:23:22.298 --> 1:23:23.063
Take care, everybody.

1:23:23.165 --> 1:23:24.965
- Thanks, guys!
- Safe travels!

1:23:25.067 --> 1:23:26.266
- [David] Thank you.

1:23:26.369 --> 1:23:28.969
(gentle music)
