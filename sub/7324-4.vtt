07:36.757 --> 07:38.759
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA
GET YOU SOME PAINKILLERS,

07:38.759 --> 07:41.091
AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU
UP TO X-RAYS.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.633
OH, GOD. OKAY.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.635
(voice breaks) UM...

07:44.635 --> 07:46.597
AM I GONNA WALK AGAIN?

07:46.597 --> 07:47.938
NO.

07:47.938 --> 07:49.800
(people speaking indistinctly)

07:49.800 --> 07:51.642
I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.
YOU'RE FINE.

07:51.642 --> 07:53.804
JUST GOT A FEW BROKEN TOES,
IF THAT.

07:53.804 --> 07:55.145
JUST TOES?

07:55.145 --> 07:56.146
YEAH.

07:56.146 --> 07:58.609
D-DO I AT LEAST GET
A CAST FOR THAT?

07:58.609 --> 08:00.250
PRIMARY SURVEY LOOKS GOOD.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.783
OKAY. WELL, THIS LACERATION
LOOKS DEEP.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.255
LET'S SET UP A SUTURE KIT
AND 4-0 VICRYL.

08:05.255 --> 08:06.657
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

08:06.657 --> 08:07.818
(man) AH! OHH!

08:07.818 --> 08:09.860
THIS IS, UM...

08:09.860 --> 08:12.192
WHY ISN'T THIS BLEEDING?

08:12.192 --> 08:13.724
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:13.724 --> 08:16.527
WHAT IS...

08:16.527 --> 08:17.698
(crinkles)

08:17.698 --> 08:19.129
IT'S FAKE.

08:19.129 --> 08:22.032
THE DAMN THING IS FAKE.

08:22.032 --> 08:23.974
AH, NEVER MIND.

08:23.974 --> 08:27.708
MOVING ON TO THE LACERATION
ON HER CLAVICLE.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.681
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:30.681 --> 08:32.643
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

08:32.643 --> 08:36.617
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:36.617 --> 08:39.189
LOOK, IS THERE ANY
REAL BLOOD HERE AT ALL?

08:39.189 --> 08:41.191
HUH?
(man) IT WAS CRAZY.

08:41.191 --> 08:43.794
500 PEOPLE TRYING TO FIT
THROUGH THIS ONE LITTLE DOOR.

08:43.794 --> 08:45.596
HELL, THAT KID
IN THE BORG COSTUME

08:45.596 --> 08:47.257
TRIPPED ME ON PURPOSE.

08:47.257 --> 08:48.699
(elevator bell dings)
THEY JUST KEPT COMING
AND COMING,

08:48.699 --> 08:49.860
LIKE THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE

08:49.860 --> 08:51.531
THEY WERE RUNNING OVER
A HUMAN BEING.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.633
(man groans)

08:52.633 --> 08:54.264
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WE GOT NECK TENDERNESS,

08:54.264 --> 08:55.566
SO WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL
ON THIS.

08:55.566 --> 08:56.567
(groaning)

08:56.567 --> 08:57.668
ONE, TWO, THREE.

08:57.668 --> 08:59.610
THE WORST PART WAS WHEN
KEITH'S HEAD

08:59.610 --> 09:01.642
GOT CAUGHT ON THIS
ONE GUY'S COSTUME AND--

09:01.642 --> 09:02.943
AND IT RIPPED OFF
HIS EAR?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.274
THAT'S BAD, ISN'T IT?

09:04.274 --> 09:05.816
HOW DID NOBODY MENTION
THAT YOUR EAR IS RIPPED OFF?

09:05.816 --> 09:07.678
WELL, WE LOOKED AROUND
ON THE FLOOR FOR A WHILE,

09:07.678 --> 09:09.079
BUT IT'S PROBABLY,
LIKE, STUCK

09:09.079 --> 09:10.681
TO SOME STORMTROOPER'S BOOT.

09:10.681 --> 09:11.982
(groans) WELL, AT LEAST
WE GOT WHAT WE CAME FOR.

09:11.982 --> 09:14.324
WE GOT A TARDIS.

09:14.324 --> 09:16.727
WELL...

09:16.727 --> 09:18.689
IGOT A TARDIS.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.030
(pants)

09:20.030 --> 09:29.039
(sirens wailing)

09:34.074 --> 09:35.575
(Alex) YOU BROKE SEVEN TOES,
BUT REALLY FIVE

09:35.575 --> 09:37.207
'CAUSE PINKIE TOES
BARELY COUNT.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.079
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA TAPE 'EM
UP AND GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.080
TAPE?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.581
I SURVIVE A HUMAN STAMPEDE,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.754
AND ALL I GET IS TAPE?

09:43.754 --> 09:45.255
I'LL THROW IN SOME CRUTCHES.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.918
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE GOT GREAT BALANCE.

09:47.918 --> 09:49.960
WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE ANYWAY?

09:49.960 --> 09:51.061
I'M A HOBBIT.

09:52.262 --> 09:53.263
WE'RE A GENTLE FOLK

09:53.263 --> 09:55.325
FROM A FARMING COMMUNITY
CALLED THE SHIRE.

09:55.325 --> 09:57.898
IT'S IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER
OF MIDDLE EARTH.

09:57.898 --> 09:58.899
(inhales)

09:58.899 --> 10:00.901
WE LIVE A... SIMPLE LIFE,

10:00.901 --> 10:03.173
BUT WE CRAVE... ADVENTURE.

10:03.173 --> 10:04.735
AND WHEN WE FIND IT,

10:04.735 --> 10:07.808
SOME BECOME HEROES.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.939
(inhales deeply)

10:08.939 --> 10:11.211
THE DOTHRAKI PRINCESS.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.214
YEAH. I STOPPED CARING
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.986
NO. THAT--THAT DOCTOR
OVER THERE LOOKS JUST LIKE

10:15.986 --> 10:17.317
THE DOTHRAKI PRINCESS

10:17.317 --> 10:19.289
FROM THE LEGENDARY
"SONG OF ICE AND FIRE" SERIES.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.021
NOT HER HAIR,
BUT HER--HER--HER SKIN

10:21.021 --> 10:22.923
AND HER EYES, AND--

10:22.923 --> 10:24.925
OH, OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
HERE SHE COMES.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.356
UM...

10:29.059 --> 10:30.300
HER?

10:30.300 --> 10:32.302
YOU HAVE NERD CHUB
FOR KEPNER?

10:32.302 --> 10:34.965
KEPNER.

10:34.965 --> 10:37.237
KAREV, TRAUMA ROOM, NOW.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.638
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:38.638 --> 10:40.711
(whispers) KEPNER.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.372
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:42.372 --> 10:43.373
GIVE ME MY TARDIS!

10:43.373 --> 10:44.274
IT'S NOT YOURS!
I FOUGHT FOR IT!

10:44.274 --> 10:46.216
I LOST AN EAR FOR IT!

10:46.216 --> 10:47.417
KAREV. PLEASE.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.219
NO, HE'S STEALING
MY TARDIS!
LET'S GO.

10:49.219 --> 10:50.350
JUST STOP HIM.
MR. HITCHENS,

10:50.350 --> 10:52.953
YOUR EAR HAS LOST ALL
OF ITS SOFT TISSUE, BUT--

10:52.953 --> 10:55.055
WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT
AN ENTIRELY NEW EAR.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.758
WE'LL TAKE CARTILAGE
FROM YOUR RIBS AND MATCH IT

10:57.758 --> 10:59.429
TO THE EXACT SIZE AND SHAPE
OF YOUR EXISTING EAR.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.231
IT'S A LONG PROCESS,

11:01.231 --> 11:03.433
BUT WHEN WE'RE FINISHED,
THAT EAR WILL LOOK GOOD.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.865
(inhales)

11:04.865 --> 11:06.366
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD,
AVERY?

11:06.366 --> 11:09.299
NO. YOU COVERED IT.

11:09.299 --> 11:10.370
MR. HITCHENS,

11:10.370 --> 11:12.743
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING
RIGHT NOW?

11:12.743 --> 11:14.304
HURT, BETRAYED.

11:14.304 --> 11:15.706
ANYTHING IN YOUR LEGS?

11:15.706 --> 11:17.908
(pants) NO.

11:17.908 --> 11:18.909
NOTHING.

11:18.909 --> 11:20.080
(Derek) ALL RIGHT.
HE NEEDS AN M.R.I.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.311
RIGHT AWAY, OKAY?

11:21.311 --> 11:22.452
(pager beeps)

11:22.452 --> 11:25.155
(Derek exhales deeply)

11:25.155 --> 11:27.117
YOU PAGED.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:27.117 --> 11:29.119
DR. WARREN'S RESIDENT
PUNCTURED THE DURA

11:29.119 --> 11:30.360
OF YOUR PATIENT
FROM THIS MORNING

11:30.360 --> 11:32.122
DURING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A ROUTINE EPIDURAL.

11:32.122 --> 11:33.693
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

11:33.693 --> 11:35.425
AS ANYTHING ROUTINE
AFTER A PATIENT'S HAD SURGERY.

11:35.425 --> 11:37.067
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO YELL AT MY RESIDENT.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.900
THERE WAS SPINAL FLUID
ALL OVER HER BED.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.201
HOW IS THE PATIENT?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.302
JUST CHECKED ON HER.
SHE'S STABLE AND PAIN FREE.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.774
YOUR RESIDENT WAS SLOPPY
AND RUSHED.

11:43.774 --> 11:45.736
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW DIFFICULT
EPIDURALS CAN BE.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.277
BECAUSE I'M A NURSE?
WATCH YOUR TONE WITH ME.

11:47.277 --> 11:48.708
OR WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.280
(lowered voice) OKAY, OKAY,
DONE. BREAK IT UP.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.283
WALK AWAY. WE'RE DONE.

11:53.283 --> 11:54.745
WALK AWAY.

11:54.745 --> 11:56.817
WALK AWAY.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.318
I GET WHY
YOU'RE MAD AT THE GUY,

11:58.318 --> 12:00.350
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A FIGHT ABOUT BAILEY,

12:00.350 --> 12:01.351
DO IT ON YOUR OWN TIME.

12:01.351 --> 12:03.093
FIGHT ABOUT BAILEY?

12:03.093 --> 12:05.255
WAIT.NO.

12:05.255 --> 12:07.157
NO, B-BAILEY--
BAILEY'S WITH HIM?!

12:07.157 --> 12:08.298
I SHOULD GO.

12:08.298 --> 12:10.360
(stammers) LIKE THEY WENT
TO DINNER ONCE OR TWICE OR--

12:10.360 --> 12:11.862
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO KNOW.
SHEPHERD.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.303
LIKE DON'T GO
INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM

12:13.303 --> 12:15.005
ON EIGHT OR NINE
WITHOUT KNOCKING.

12:15.005 --> 12:16.306
OH, COME ON.
YOU ASKED.

12:16.306 --> 12:18.168
DOES SHE TALK ABOUT HIM?

12:18.168 --> 12:20.470
YEAH, SHE SAID HIS HANDS
HAVE A KIND OF TENDERNESS,

12:20.470 --> 12:22.272
UH, SOME KIND OF MAGIC.
(elevator bell dings)

12:22.272 --> 12:23.413
YOU'RE AN ASS.

12:23.413 --> 12:24.744
DON'T YELL AT MY NURSES,
EVEN THE MEN.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.847
SURE. JUST DROP A BOMB
AND WALK AWAY.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.448
WALK AWAY!

12:28.448 --> 12:29.850
UH, OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT?

12:29.850 --> 12:30.851
SIGN THESE?

12:30.851 --> 12:31.852
MM-HMM.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.023
AND THESE.

12:33.023 --> 12:34.925
AND THIS NEEDS TO BE IN
BY THIS AFTERNOON.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.387
WELL, I WILL LOOK AT THAT
RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU.

12:37.387 --> 12:38.789
SURE.

12:38.789 --> 12:39.930
(inhales)

12:39.930 --> 12:41.131
(groans)

12:41.131 --> 12:42.432
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.

12:42.432 --> 12:45.395
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:45.395 --> 12:47.337
(Lexie) COMING THROUGH!

12:47.337 --> 12:51.041
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

12:53.143 --> 12:54.444
(clears throat)

12:54.444 --> 12:56.476
(man) CODE BLUE IN 32-12.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.778
CODE BLUE, 32-12.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.011
(women speak indistinctly)

13:01.011 --> 13:02.182
(sighs)

13:04.484 --> 13:06.486
(Alex) HEY, AVERY,
CHECK THIS OUT.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.358
(Jackson) DAMN.

13:08.358 --> 13:10.060
C-6 IS TOTALLY SHATTERED.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.022
I KNOW. (chuckles)

13:12.022 --> 13:15.395
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

13:15.395 --> 13:17.397
(sighs)

13:17.397 --> 13:19.399
I USED TO EAT
MY LUNCH HERE, TOO.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.500
YEAH.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.173
HELPS BREAK UP THE DAY
AND GETS YOU OUTTA THE OFFICE

13:23.173 --> 13:25.135
AND LET'S YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE STILL IN THE ACTION.

13:25.135 --> 13:26.376
(chuckles) YEAH.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.879
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT NEED ME FOR?

13:28.879 --> 13:30.240
OH, OH, NO, NO.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.582
I'M JUST CUTTING THROUGH
ON MY WAY TO THE SKILLS LAB.

13:32.582 --> 13:35.545
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

13:35.545 --> 13:36.947
UM...

13:36.947 --> 13:38.889
ACTUALLY, UM...

13:38.889 --> 13:40.520
YOU GONNA EAT THOSE GRAPES?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.853
(elevator bell dings)

13:42.853 --> 13:45.295
(door opens)

13:45.295 --> 13:46.526
HOW ARE THE SCANS?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.398
HE'S GOT A BURST FRACTURE
OF C-6

13:48.398 --> 13:50.400
SO WE NEED TO DO
DISCECTOMIES ABOVE AND BELOW.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.103
I THOUGHT I'D PUT IN
A FIBULAR GRAFT AND A PLATE.

13:53.103 --> 13:55.405
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.

13:55.405 --> 13:57.407
YOU THINK SINCE I'M OPERATING
IN TWO PLACES,

13:57.407 --> 14:00.240
THAT THIS COULD COUNT
AS TWO NEUROSURGERIES?

14:01.541 --> 14:04.444
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LOG
MORE NON-PEDS SURGERIES?

14:04.444 --> 14:05.415
YEAH.
THAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

14:05.415 --> 14:06.947
YOUNG MAN'S SPINE
IS PULVERIZED.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.478
YOU BLINK ONCE,
HE MAY NEVER WALK AGAIN.

14:08.478 --> 14:09.880
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE SURGERY?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.551
YOU WANT TO ASK TO SEE IF YOU
CAN GET TWO GOLD STARS

14:11.551 --> 14:13.353
INSTEAD OF ONE?
NO, I--

14:13.353 --> 14:15.625
JUST GET OUTTA HERE.
YOU'RE OFF MY SERVICE.

14:15.625 --> 14:16.626
GO.

14:16.626 --> 14:17.988
(trash can clatters)

14:19.159 --> 14:21.161
SHEPHERD JUST KICKED ME
OFF NEURO

14:21.161 --> 14:23.433
'CAUSE I DON'T PISS MYSELF
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT A SPINE.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.495
THE GUY IS A DOUCHE.

14:25.495 --> 14:27.938
HIS WIFE WAS HIS RESIDENT,
AND NOW HE'S GOT YOU.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.940
TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW.

14:29.940 --> 14:30.941
SORRY, CHIEF.

14:30.941 --> 14:32.042
I'M NOT THE CHIEF.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.603
WE'RE PRACTICING
MICROSURGERY TECHNIQUES.

14:33.603 --> 14:36.446
NOT FOR SNACKING.

14:36.446 --> 14:38.478
YOU KNOW, YOU TWO NEED
TO FIND A WAY

14:38.478 --> 14:40.510
TO START FEELING
THE JOY AGAIN.

14:40.510 --> 14:42.182
I MEAN,
THERE'S GONNA COME A TIME

14:42.182 --> 14:43.984
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BE WISHING
YOU WERE FIFTHYEAR AGAIN

14:43.984 --> 14:47.487
JUST TO GET BACK IN THE O.R.
AND GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.919
YOU'LL OPERATE ON A GRAPE

14:48.919 --> 14:50.460
JUST SO YOU'LL KEEP
FROM GETTING RUSTY.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.492
YOU'RE IN THE O.R.
ALL THE TIME.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.893
TO SUPERVISE, SURE.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.497
THEY'LL BRING ME IN
ON A REALLY COMPLICATED PART.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.100
BUT I NEVER OPEN,
I NEVER CLOSE.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.133
IS THIS A TECHNIQUE I COULD
USE ON AN EAR RECONSTRUCTION?

15:03.133 --> 15:04.274
YEAH, NOW YOU SEE THERE?

15:04.274 --> 15:06.276
AVERY'S STARTING
TO FEEL THE JOY.

15:06.276 --> 15:07.577
PULL UP A GRAPE.

15:07.577 --> 15:09.009
YES.
PLEASE.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.340
SLOAN WON'T LET HIM
TOUCH AN INSTRUMENT.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.681
HE BARELY LETS HIM
FINISH A SENTENCE.

15:11.681 --> 15:13.643
AT LEAST HE LETS ME
IN THE O.R.

15:13.643 --> 15:14.544
(clears throat)

15:14.544 --> 15:16.686
CAN I GET YOU A GRAPE?

15:16.686 --> 15:19.019
THANKS, BUT ROBBINS SAYS
SHE'S KICKING ME TO THE CURB

15:19.019 --> 15:20.590
IF I DON'T PUBLISH.

15:20.590 --> 15:23.123
I GOTTA DO
MY DAMN AFRICA PAPER.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.155
UGH.

15:25.155 --> 15:26.656
(door opens)

15:26.656 --> 15:27.697
(blows air)

15:27.697 --> 15:29.059
(door closes)
HE'S NOT FEELING THE JOY.

15:29.059 --> 15:31.331
NOPE.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.603
NOW YOU SEE THIS,
HOW I'M DOING IT HERE?

15:33.603 --> 15:36.336
(sighs)

15:36.336 --> 15:38.508
WOW.
THAT BAD, HUH?

15:38.508 --> 15:39.970
I'M COMPLETELY BURIED
IN PAPERWORK.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.571
I'M CHAINED
TO THIS DAMNED DESK.

15:41.571 --> 15:43.143
FINISH YOUR DRINK.
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.144
AND GO WHERE?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.645
JUST FINISH YOUR DRINK.

15:47.517 --> 15:48.718
MMM.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.082
(hammering)

15:52.082 --> 15:53.953
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.285
YOUR CONTRACTOR DOESN'T CARE

15:55.285 --> 15:56.586
THAT YOU'RE BUILDING
THIS DECK YOURSELF?

15:56.586 --> 15:58.328
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT,

15:58.328 --> 15:59.659
BUT HE DOES WORK FOR ME.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.332
IF I DIDN'T HAVE THIS...
I'D KILL MY RESIDENT.

16:02.332 --> 16:03.333
KAREV?

16:03.333 --> 16:04.995
AH, HE'S JUST NOT INTERESTED.

16:04.995 --> 16:08.538
THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN
WAS WIDE OPEN,

16:08.538 --> 16:10.570
PERFECT VIEW OF THE CORD--

16:10.570 --> 16:12.442
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
HE JUST COULD CARE LESS.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.374
HE'S JUST PUNCHING
A TIME CLOCK.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.675
HE'S NOT MEREDITH.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.507
NO, HE'S NOT.

16:17.507 --> 16:19.509
(Josh Ritter's "Tokyo!" playing)

16:19.509 --> 16:21.011
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU QUIT AS CHIEF,

16:21.011 --> 16:22.712
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

16:22.712 --> 16:25.415
NOW NOT SO MUCH?

16:25.415 --> 16:27.417
IS IT ME OR IS
EVERYONE IN THE HOSPITAL

16:27.417 --> 16:29.419
JUST WAITING FOR ME
TO FALL ON MY FACE?

16:29.419 --> 16:31.561
OH, NO.
WE ALL GOT MONEY ON IT.

16:31.561 --> 16:33.263
I GOT YOU DOWN FOR $100

16:33.263 --> 16:35.465
THAT YOU MAKE IT AT LEAST
SIX MONTHS, SO BUCK UP.

16:35.465 --> 16:38.068
♪ NO MATTER HOW KIND, LOVE
AT TIMES GONNA TAKE ITS TOLL ♪

16:38.068 --> 16:40.400
(groans) I'VE BEEN WALKING ON
EGGSHELLS AT HOME FOR WEEKS.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.603
I USED TO COME TO WORK
TO LET OFF STEAM, AND NOW...

16:43.603 --> 16:46.136
THAT'S BECOME
A NIGHTMARE, TOO.

16:47.677 --> 16:51.081

16:51.081 --> 16:53.343

5-0 MONOCRYL

17:00.690 --> 17:02.522
AND POOF!

17:02.522 --> 17:04.754
LIKE MAGIC,
THERE WAS NO SCAR AT ALL.

17:04.754 --> 17:07.397
(cell phone rings)

17:07.397 --> 17:09.629
WE'RE FINE, JUST LIKE
WE WERE 20 MINUTES AGO

17:09.629 --> 17:11.601
AND 20 MINUTES BEFORE THAT.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.233
(sighs)

17:14.604 --> 17:16.606
ARE YOU GONNA KEEP THIS UP
ALL THREE DAYS?

17:16.606 --> 17:19.309

17:19.309 --> 17:20.670

17:27.777 --> 17:29.779
Are you there?
(exhales deeply)

17:29.779 --> 17:32.152
GUESS WHO JUST ROLLED OVER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.725
(continues cooing)

17:35.725 --> 17:37.727

17:46.666 --> 17:48.368
KAREV!

17:48.368 --> 17:49.539
HUNT TOLD ME
I COULD TAKE HIS CHAIR.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.171
SOFIA ROLLED OFF THE SOFA
LAST NIGHT,

17:51.171 --> 17:52.842
AND SHE HASN'T CRIED SINCE.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

17:52.842 --> 17:54.574
YEAH, I'M NOT A PEDIATRICIAN.
SORRY.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.607
IF I TELL ANYONE IN PEDS,
THEY'LL CALL ARIZONA.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.279
YEAH, I GOT A PAPER TO WRITE.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.850
YOU DROP WHAT YOU'RE DOING
RIGHT NOW

18:00.850 --> 18:03.483
BY THE TIME I COUNT TO THREE,
OR I WILL END YOU.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.316
ONE, TWO...

18:09.559 --> 18:12.222
(sighs)

18:13.623 --> 18:15.395
ALL RIGHT, THE RESIDENTS' LOUNGE
NEEDS A NEW COUCH.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.626
MAKE SURE THAT GETS THERE.

18:16.626 --> 18:18.228
AND LET'S SEE
IF THE NURSES' STATION

18:18.228 --> 18:20.470
ON THE THIRD FLOOR
COULD USE THIS DESK.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.302
MM-HMM. OKAY.
THANK YOU.
(inhales deeply)

18:22.302 --> 18:23.703
I KNOW. I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

18:23.703 --> 18:25.305
AND NO,

18:25.305 --> 18:27.577
AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT WANT ME TO,
I AM NOT RESIGNING.

18:27.577 --> 18:29.639
I'M JUST GETTING RID
OF A FEW THINGS

18:29.639 --> 18:32.242
THAT I DON'T FEEL
I NEED TO BE CHIEF.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.113
AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT HOW

18:34.113 --> 18:35.815
I'M GONNA NEED MY OFFICE
OR NEED MY DESK.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.347
I SAY YOU'RE WRONG.

18:37.347 --> 18:40.590
I SAY MY OFFICE CAN BE
WHEREVER I AM. OKAY?

18:48.728 --> 18:50.430
THE PROCEDURE WENT WELL,

18:50.430 --> 18:52.262
BUT YOUR SPINE
IS STILL VERY FRAGILE.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.563
GOOD NEWS.
WE FOUND THE EAR.

18:53.563 --> 18:54.904
I FOUND IT.

18:54.904 --> 18:57.507
UH, I WENT BACK
TO THE CONVENTION CENTER,

18:57.507 --> 18:59.809
STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT, LOOKING
THROUGH DUMPSTERS AND TRASH.

18:59.809 --> 19:01.741
BUT GUESS WHERE IT WAS.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.474
THE LOST AND FOUND,
HOOKED ON TO SOME CRAZY HELMET.

19:04.474 --> 19:06.476
WHERE'S MY TARDIS?

19:06.476 --> 19:07.617
OKAY.

19:07.617 --> 19:11.751
HOW ABOUT A "THANK YOU, GREG,
FOR FINDING MY EAR

19:11.751 --> 19:13.323
IN THE TRASH"?

19:13.323 --> 19:15.625
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY EAR.
I CARE ABOUT THE TARDIS.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.826
WE CARE
ABOUT THE EAR, KEITH.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.329
(Derek)
KEITH, TRY NOT TO MOVE, OKAY?

19:19.329 --> 19:20.630
(Keith) FINE.

19:20.630 --> 19:22.362
CAN YOU AT LEAST...

19:22.362 --> 19:26.165
KEEP IT IN THE LIVING ROOM
SO I CAN LOOK AT IT?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.338
ACTUALLY...

19:28.338 --> 19:30.800
OH, MY GOD.
YOU SOLD IT, DIDN'T YOU?

19:30.800 --> 19:32.342
YOU SOLD IT?!
NO!

19:32.342 --> 19:33.773
(Jackson and Derek
shout indistinctly)
AAH!

19:33.773 --> 19:35.245
I'LL STABILIZE HIS NECK.

19:35.245 --> 19:36.306
ALL RIGHT,
MOVE YOUR FINGERS FOR ME.
AAH!

19:36.306 --> 19:37.377
YOUR TOES.
AAH!

19:37.377 --> 19:38.508
(Greg) IS HE OKAY?
MOVE YOUR TOES.

19:38.508 --> 19:39.609
IS HE OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.

19:39.609 --> 19:40.850
AAH!
HIS LOWER EXTREMITIES
JUST WENT LIMP.

19:40.850 --> 19:43.313
KEITH, TRY AND MOVE
YOUR FEET FOR ME, PLEASE.

19:43.313 --> 19:44.314
(Keith grunts)

19:44.314 --> 19:46.416
NOW WIGGLE YOUR TOES.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.720
SHE'S USUALLY
A LOT MORE ALERT THAN THIS.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.392
I SAT UP WITH HER ALL NIGHT,

19:52.392 --> 19:54.794
CHECKING TO MAKE SURE
SHE WAS STILL BREATHING.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.965
MAYBE THE REASON
SHE'S NOT ALERT

19:55.965 --> 19:57.627
IS BECAUSE YOU KEPT HER UP
ALL NIGHT.

19:57.627 --> 19:58.668
(beeping)
WHAT'S THAT?

19:58.668 --> 20:00.670
RIGHT THERE. SEE THAT?

20:00.670 --> 20:02.472
YEAH. IT'S
A PERFECTLY HEALTHY BRAIN

20:02.472 --> 20:04.404
OF A PERFECTLY HEALTHY BABY

20:04.404 --> 20:05.875
WHO DIDN'T NEED A C.T. SCAN.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.677
(pager beeps)

20:07.677 --> 20:10.510
THE BABY'S FINE.
I'M GOING NOW.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.982
(door opens)

20:12.982 --> 20:14.514
YEAH, THERE'S THE TIGER.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.886
(deepens voice) OOH,
THERE'S THE TIGER. (growls)

20:16.886 --> 20:18.848
THE GUY THREW
A BEER BOTTLE AT ME.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.820
WHO THROWS BOTTLES
AT PEOPLE'S HEADS?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.552
CARTER?

20:22.552 --> 20:23.723
W-WHY ARE YOU BACK?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
THE NURSE SAYS YOU THINK
I MISSED SOMETHING.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.856
(man) GET OFF ME!

20:26.856 --> 20:28.958
YOU STUPID KIDS
WITH YOUR IDIOT CONVENTION!

20:28.958 --> 20:31.431
EVERY YEAR, YOU LINE UP
ON MY LAWN,

20:31.431 --> 20:32.962
BLOCK MY DRIVEWAY.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.504
IT'S MY PROPERTY,
GOT IT?!

20:34.504 --> 20:35.665
SIR! SIR!
I'M GONNA HAVE YOU ARRESTED!

20:35.665 --> 20:37.407
YOU THREW A BOTTLEAT ME!

20:37.407 --> 20:39.409
SIR, GET BACK IN THE GURNEY
RIGHT NOW!

20:39.409 --> 20:41.641
I NEED YOU BACK IN THE GURNEY.
THANK YOU.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.242
BED SIX, PLEASE.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.474
(groans)

20:44.474 --> 20:47.477
(indistinct conversations)

20:49.619 --> 20:51.751
YOU'RE HERE
TO SEE KEPNER AGAIN.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.684
UH, NO. I'M HERE
FOR AN EXAM. I FEEL SICK.

20:54.684 --> 20:57.287
LOOK, WHY DON'T I GIVE HER
YOUR NUMBER, YOU GET OUTTA HERE,

20:57.287 --> 20:59.289
YOU GIVE HER A CALL,
GET YOUR GEEK ON?

20:59.289 --> 21:00.760
OH, NO. I COULD NEVER--

21:00.760 --> 21:02.532
NO, TRUST ME. YOU TWO HAVE
MORE IN COMMON THAN YOU THINK.

21:02.532 --> 21:04.764
COULDN'T YOU JUST ADMIT ME
AS A PATIENT FOR THE DAY?

21:04.764 --> 21:05.795
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

21:05.795 --> 21:07.637
BUT WHAT IF MY FOOT
WAS HURTING, OR MY LEG?

21:07.637 --> 21:09.469
I'M NOT GIVING UP A BED FOR
A STALKER WITH FAKE SYMPTOMS.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.470
FORGET IT.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.472
I HAVE CHEST PAINS,

21:12.472 --> 21:14.304
WHICH MEANS YOU--
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT ME

21:14.304 --> 21:17.977
AND KEEP ME FOR OBSERVATION,
RIGHT?

21:17.977 --> 21:21.981
(indistinct conversations)

21:21.981 --> 21:25.485
KEITH REINJURED HIS SPINE,
CREATING AN EPIDURAL BLEED

21:25.485 --> 21:27.887
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
(beeping)

21:27.887 --> 21:29.058
(Mark) SO DOES THE EAR.

21:29.058 --> 21:31.521
HIS EAR IS COSMETIC. THE BLEED
COULD LEAVE HIM PARALYZED.

21:31.521 --> 21:32.992
THE EAR'S BEEN DETACHED
FOR OVER 20 HOURS.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.025
IF WE DON'T REATTACH IT SOON,
IT WON'T BE VIABLE AT ALL.

21:36.025 --> 21:37.397
ARE YOU GOING IN
THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE NECK

21:37.397 --> 21:38.528
TO GET TO THE SPINE?

21:38.528 --> 21:39.729
(Derek) YES.

21:39.729 --> 21:40.830
SO THE PATIENT WILL BE
ON HIS BACK ALREADY.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.372
(Derek) MM-HMM.

21:42.372 --> 21:43.833
WHY DON'T WE INSERT THE EAR
INTO THE ABDOMEN?

21:43.833 --> 21:46.536
KEEP IT VIABLE
WITH THE BLOOD SUPPLY THERE,

21:46.536 --> 21:47.837
LET YOU OPERATE ON THE SPINE.

21:47.837 --> 21:49.809
TAKE IT OUT TOMORROW,
REATTACH IT.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.810
GOOD IDEA.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.941
REALLY GOOD IDEA.

21:51.941 --> 21:53.943
SHEP, YOU NEED ME?

21:53.943 --> 21:55.615
OH, YES.

21:58.047 --> 21:59.589
(sighs)

21:59.589 --> 22:00.890
SO I...

22:00.890 --> 22:02.652
JUST SWUNG BY YOUR OFFICE,
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

22:02.652 --> 22:03.893
NEITHER WAS
ANY OF YOUR FURNITURE.

22:03.893 --> 22:05.895
MY OFFICE
IS WHERE I AM.

22:05.895 --> 22:07.497
YOU'RE REALLY TAKING THIS

22:07.497 --> 22:09.629
"NOT BEING CHAINED BEHIND
YOUR DESK" THING SERIOUSLY.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.100
MM. YOU FIND
A NEW RESIDENT YET?

22:11.100 --> 22:12.462
I MIGHT HAVE A CANDIDATE.

22:12.462 --> 22:13.633
BY THE WAY,
MY CONTRACTOR CALLED.

22:13.633 --> 22:14.764
THE LUMBER FOR THE DECK
IS IN.

22:14.764 --> 22:16.766
I'M THERE.
I GET THE POWER SAW.

22:16.766 --> 22:18.608
(elevator bell dings)

22:18.608 --> 22:20.440
OW.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.442
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
REAL PAIN FEELS LIKE.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.515
YOU, UH, THINK SHE'S OKAY
OVER THERE WITH THAT GUY?

22:25.515 --> 22:26.516
SHE'S FINE.

22:26.516 --> 22:27.517
GET OFF OF ME!

22:27.517 --> 22:29.118
SIR, IF YOU DO NOT
CALM DOWN,

22:29.118 --> 22:30.780
WE WILL HAVE TO RESTRAIN YOU.
UH, ARE YOU...

22:30.780 --> 22:31.951
OH, I'M LEAVING.

22:31.951 --> 22:32.882
ARE YOU SURE SHE'S OKAY?

22:32.882 --> 22:34.053
NOW!
AH!

22:34.053 --> 22:35.825
CALL SECURITY!

22:35.825 --> 22:37.427
SIR. SIR.
WHAT THE HELL?

22:37.427 --> 22:38.928
(man) I HAVE TO
PROTECT MY HOUSE!
OH, GOD. HE'S HULKING OUT.

22:38.928 --> 22:40.430
(object clatters)
SECURITY!

22:40.430 --> 22:41.431
(grunts)

22:41.431 --> 22:43.132
GIVE ME
5 OF HALOPERIDOL I.M.

22:43.132 --> 22:45.134
I HAVE TO PROTECT MY HOUSE!

22:45.134 --> 22:46.496
CAN WE GET SOME HELP?!

22:46.496 --> 22:47.967
UH, HEY. UH, HEY.
(man) GET OFF ME!

22:47.967 --> 22:49.769
GET OUTTA MY WAY!

22:49.769 --> 22:51.671
UH, SOMEBODY, THEY--THEY NEED
SOME HELP OVER THERE.
I SAID NO!

22:51.671 --> 22:53.473
GET OFF OF ME!
(Alex) YOU'VE GOTTA
HOLD HIM STILL!

22:53.473 --> 22:54.974
(April) I'M TRYING!

22:54.974 --> 22:55.845
AAH!

22:55.845 --> 22:57.046
(exhales deeply)

22:57.046 --> 22:58.608
WE ARE A GENTLE FOLK...

22:58.608 --> 22:59.909
AAH!
WHO CRAVE ADVENTURE.

22:59.909 --> 23:01.751
(grunting)

23:01.751 --> 23:04.684
WE ARE A GENTLE FOLK
WHO CRAVE ADVENTURE.

23:04.684 --> 23:05.685
(grunts)

23:05.685 --> 23:07.787
WHEN WE FIND IT,
WE BECOME...

23:07.787 --> 23:09.388
AAH!
HEROES.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.562
I CAN'T BE HERE!
(April) SOMEONE STOP HIM!

23:12.562 --> 23:14.694
EXCUSE ME, UH, SIR.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.897
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN
RIGHT NOW AND STOP--

23:17.897 --> 23:19.068
SCREW YOU!
(grunts)

23:19.068 --> 23:21.070
(screaming)

23:21.070 --> 23:22.632
(Owen) WHERE IS HE?
(man) AROUND THE CORNER.

23:22.632 --> 23:25.004
BOOK O.R. TWO FOR A POSSIBLE
CONCUSSION AND A BROKEN JAW.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.476
WE HAVE A PATIENT
WITH A BROKEN JAW?

23:26.476 --> 23:27.807
WE'RE ABOUT TO.
I'M ON IT.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.939
(Carter) AAH!
HEY.

23:29.939 --> 23:30.980
(grunts)

23:40.650 --> 23:41.651
(elevator bell dings)

23:41.651 --> 23:42.822
(whispers) OW.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.123
IS IT TRUE,
DID YOU PUNCH A GUY?

23:44.123 --> 23:45.655
(normal voice) SHEP,
I NEED A NEURO CONSULT.

23:45.655 --> 23:46.896
WHY, BECAUSE YOU
PUNCHED A GUY?

23:46.896 --> 23:48.798
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR
ABOUT YOU PUNCHING A GUY?

23:48.798 --> 23:50.730
ALL RIGHT, YES,
I PUNCHED A PATIENT

23:50.730 --> 23:52.732
WHO WAS ENDANGERING
THE SAFETY OF MY NURSES,

23:52.732 --> 23:54.964
MY RESIDENTS,
AND OTHER PATIENTS.

23:54.964 --> 23:57.637
YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE CHIEF
NOT THE SHERIFF, RIGHT?
(scoffs)

23:57.637 --> 23:58.838
THE SCAN IS CLEAR.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.069
THANK YOU, ALL OF YOU,
REALLY.

24:00.069 --> 24:03.142
(pager beeps)

24:03.142 --> 24:04.844
ALL RIGHT.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.145
YEAH, SOMEBODY PAGED ME?

24:06.145 --> 24:07.747
THIS IS CARTER.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.048
HE JUST GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.120
THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD
IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY

24:11.120 --> 24:12.482
AND A SPLENIC LACERATION.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.123
WELL, THIS COULD TAKE
A WHILE TO FIX.

24:14.123 --> 24:16.125
WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY, SO...

24:16.125 --> 24:18.528
YEAH. OKAY, NOW WHERE
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

24:18.528 --> 24:19.859
OH, I DON'T NEED
TRAUMA HOURS.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.691
I NEED, UH, NEURO HOURS
AND TO FINISH MY PAPER.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.462
NO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.695
BOKI, YOU STILL HAVE
MY PLAYLIST ON ROTATION?

24:25.695 --> 24:27.466
WELL, CRANK IT UP.

24:53.763 --> 24:55.064

HARD FOR YOU TO SEE

MYSELF NEXT TIME.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.242
SHEPHERD LET YOU TOUCH
A VERTEBRA,

26:13.242 --> 26:15.344
NOW YOU'RE READY TO REBUILD
A FACE BY YOURSELF?

26:15.344 --> 26:16.846
NO.

26:16.846 --> 26:18.708
I JUST WANT A CHANCE
TO TRY TO PRACTICE

26:18.708 --> 26:20.109
YOUR SURGICAL TRICK

26:20.109 --> 26:21.711
ON SOMETHING
OTHER THAN FRUIT.

26:21.711 --> 26:24.183
YOU'RE NOT READY. THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE WORKING ON FRUIT.

26:24.183 --> 26:27.056
WHEN YOU'RE DONE MAIMING FRUIT,
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

26:27.056 --> 26:28.287

26:28.287 --> 26:29.719
(sighs)

26:29.719 --> 26:31.991
EVERYTHING OKAY?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.322
THIS MAY BE OUT OF LINE,

26:33.322 --> 26:35.825
BUT IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN
COME OVER TO YOUR PLACE

26:35.825 --> 26:37.596
AND HAMMER SOMETHING?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.198
I LIKE YOUR INITIATIVE,
AVERY.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.200
(sighs)

26:41.200 --> 26:43.202
SO THE WISEASS FROM LEGAL
TELLS ME

26:43.202 --> 26:45.274
I NEED TO APOLOGIZE
TO THE DRUNK

26:45.274 --> 26:47.707
WHO TORE UP MY E.R.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.878
SHE WASN'T READY
FOR A RELATIONSHIP,

26:48.878 --> 26:50.880
AND NOW SHE'S IN ONE.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.241
RIGHT. SO WHERE IS
THE ACCOUNTABILITY?

26:52.241 --> 26:53.883
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
WHAT THE--

26:53.883 --> 26:57.116
(whirring)

26:57.116 --> 26:59.018
YOU GUYS ALWAYS GET
WORKED UP LIKE THIS?

26:59.018 --> 27:00.189
(whirring continues)

27:00.189 --> 27:01.320
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.022
NO. I'M GOOD.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.324
JUST... HAMMERING.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.756
OKAY.

27:08.898 --> 27:10.860
(sighs)
THANKS FOR THIS, BY THE WAY.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.702
I KNOW SLOAN'S MY BOSS,
AND HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

27:12.702 --> 27:14.163
I WOULDN'T WANT TO OVERSTEP.

27:14.163 --> 27:15.705
(exhales)

27:15.705 --> 27:17.306
NOT THAT I EVER GET
A CHANCE

27:17.306 --> 27:18.808
TO OVERSTEP WITH HIM.

27:18.808 --> 27:19.809
(hammering)

27:19.809 --> 27:21.671
SINCE HE HAS ME
ON TRAINING WHEELS,

27:21.671 --> 27:24.373
WHICH IS FINE MOST DAYS,
EXCEPT...

27:24.373 --> 27:27.016
WHEN I GET HOME, AND IT TURNS
OUT THAT MY GIRLFRIEND,

27:27.016 --> 27:29.218
WHO IS A FOURTH YEAR,
HAS DONE MORE SURGERY THAN ME.

27:29.218 --> 27:30.980
THEN SHE ASKS ME
HOW MY DAY WENT,

27:30.980 --> 27:32.351
AND THE ANSWER IS,
"GREAT, SWEETHEART.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.223
"I JUST SPENT THE LAST
NINE HOURS STANDING AROUND

27:34.223 --> 27:35.324
WATCHING YOUR EX OPERATE."

27:35.324 --> 27:37.857
(hammers)

27:38.928 --> 27:40.089
YEAH.

27:40.089 --> 27:42.692
(whirring)

27:45.394 --> 27:47.396
(Richard) I KNOW YOU FEEL
YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE BETTER

27:47.396 --> 27:49.238
TO BE RIGHT NOW,

27:49.238 --> 27:50.740
BUT YOU DON'T.

27:50.740 --> 27:53.342
I JUST WANT TO FINISH
MY PAPER, SIR.

27:53.342 --> 27:56.305
MM. IT ALL FALLS AWAY--

27:56.305 --> 27:58.908
THE RESEARCH, THE TESTS,
THE PAPERS.

27:58.908 --> 28:01.380
WE DO IT TO GET TO THIS.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.381
UH-HUH.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.213
ADELE DOES THAT.

28:04.213 --> 28:05.785
WHAT?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.286
SHE "UH-HUHs" ME.

28:07.286 --> 28:10.359
EVERY NIGHT WHEN I
FILL HER IN ON MY DAY,

28:10.359 --> 28:13.322
SHE NODS AND GIVES ME
A LOT OF "UH-HUHs."

28:13.322 --> 28:15.364
BUT I CAN TELL
THAT SHE'S UNCOMFORTABLE

28:15.364 --> 28:16.695
BECAUSE HALF THE TIME,

28:16.695 --> 28:18.697
SHE CAN'T REMEMBER
WHERE I WORK.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.699
AND IT MAKES HER NERVOUS
WHEN I SAY

28:20.699 --> 28:23.302
I'M CUTTING PEOPLE OPEN.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.935
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T SEE
THE JOYFUL PART OF YOUR LIFE

28:25.935 --> 28:27.236
UNTIL IT'S OVER.

28:27.236 --> 28:29.278

28:32.141 --> 28:34.713

28:34.713 --> 28:36.415
YOU'RE IN IT.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.788

28:38.788 --> 28:40.219
OH, HE'S BOTTOMING OUT.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.421
GRAB THE HILUM AND HOLD PRESSURE
SO I CAN GET A BETTER LOOK.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.053
OKAY, I'M ON IT.

28:44.053 --> 28:45.054
(beeping continues)

28:45.054 --> 28:46.355
ALL RIGHT.

28:46.355 --> 28:48.898
TRYING TO LIGATE THE ARTERY
AND--

28:48.898 --> 28:51.000
DAMN IT! IT'S RETRACTING.
COME ON, CARTER.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.401
COME ON!

28:52.401 --> 28:53.763
(beeping continues)

28:53.763 --> 28:55.064
AH.

28:55.064 --> 28:56.735
LET'S SEE IF THAT'LL HOLD.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.867
READY.

28:57.867 --> 29:00.309
(beeping continues)

29:00.309 --> 29:02.071
(beeping normalizes)

29:02.071 --> 29:05.374
(exhales deeply)
VITALS STABILIZED.

29:05.374 --> 29:07.276
FEELING THE JOY YET?

29:07.276 --> 29:09.378
(laughs)
I'M FEELING IT, SIR.

29:09.378 --> 29:11.150
(laughs) OKAY.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.383
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

29:20.289 --> 29:21.290
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

29:21.290 --> 29:22.832
HEY. I'M HEADING
UP TO THE LAB.

29:22.832 --> 29:23.963
WEBBER'S GONNA SHOW ME
HIS SIGNATURE STITCH.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.464
YOU WANT TO COME?
CRAP.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.937
I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP BAILEY
AND APRIL WITH A SKILLS LAB

29:27.937 --> 29:29.999
FOR THE FIRST YEARS
RIGHT NOW.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.540
GROW A PAIR, BITCH BOY.

29:33.002 --> 29:35.845
HEY, COME ON, AVERY.
LET'S GO.

29:35.845 --> 29:37.346
ACTUALLY...

29:37.346 --> 29:39.909
I FORGOT,
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

29:39.909 --> 29:40.910
SO...

29:40.910 --> 29:42.111
AN APPOINTMENT?
WHAT APPOINTMENT?

29:42.111 --> 29:43.312
HMM?

29:43.312 --> 29:44.984
UH, WITH MAYFIELD

29:44.984 --> 29:46.555
IN 22.

29:46.555 --> 29:47.786
(elevator bell dings)

29:47.786 --> 29:48.988
OH. OKAY.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.020
UM, THAT--SURE.
YEAH, THAT--

29:51.020 --> 29:52.161
THAT--THAT'S FINE.

29:52.161 --> 29:53.522
RIGHT--
RIGHT, DR. BAILEY?

29:53.522 --> 29:56.325
SOME THINGS, AVERY,
I JUST DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

29:56.325 --> 29:58.227
(indistinct conversations)

29:58.227 --> 30:00.169
(Derek) AVERY.

30:00.169 --> 30:01.430
DECK TONIGHT?

30:01.430 --> 30:03.402
UH, WOULDN'T MISS IT.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.174
WE STILL ON FOR
THE A.V.M. TOMORROW?

30:05.174 --> 30:07.106
YES. ABSOLUTELY.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.277
GOOD.

30:08.277 --> 30:10.279
YES.

30:10.279 --> 30:11.941
(blows air)

30:11.941 --> 30:15.144
(people speaking indistinctly)

30:15.144 --> 30:16.485
(chuckles)

30:16.485 --> 30:18.217
I FINISHED--19 PAGES.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.149
OH, WELL DONE.

30:20.149 --> 30:21.450
HEY, HAND IT OVER.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.993
OH, NO. IT'S NOT READY
FOR ANYONE TO--

30:23.993 --> 30:25.895
HEY, UH, DUDE,
GIVE THAT BACK.

30:25.895 --> 30:27.196
OH, YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT
THE CHIEF?

30:27.196 --> 30:28.998
YOU'RE NOT THE CHIEF.

30:28.998 --> 30:31.861
ONCE YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT,
YOU'RE ALWAYS MR. PRESIDENT.

30:31.861 --> 30:33.162
(door opens)

30:33.162 --> 30:35.834
NOW SHEPHERD WANTS ME
ON HIS SURGERY,

30:35.834 --> 30:37.266
WHICH IS GREAT,

30:37.266 --> 30:39.038
OBVIOUSLY, BUT I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE IN SURGERY WITH SLOAN

30:39.038 --> 30:41.040
AT THE SAME TIME.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.171
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE?

30:42.171 --> 30:43.112
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO WORK WITH MORE?

30:43.112 --> 30:45.174
(sighs) I DIG PLASTICS,

30:45.174 --> 30:47.446
BUT I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY
BE ABLE TO OPERATE.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.579
WELL, YOU'RE CHOOSING BETWEEN
TWO WORLD-CLASS SURGEONS.

30:50.579 --> 30:52.151
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.953
IT IS A PRIVILEGE.
EMBRACE IT.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.184
YEAH, FEEL THE JOY.

30:55.184 --> 30:57.056
LOOK AT YOU.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.087
(chuckles)

30:58.087 --> 30:59.889
HEY, HOW'D YOU GET OUT
OF YOUR SKILLS LAB

30:59.889 --> 31:00.890
WITH BAILEY?

31:00.890 --> 31:03.893
OH. MAYFIELD EXCUSE.

31:03.893 --> 31:07.266
YOU USED THE MAYFIELD EXCUSE
ON BAILEY?

31:07.266 --> 31:09.138
YES, SIR.

31:09.138 --> 31:11.600
(laughing)

31:11.600 --> 31:13.202
I KNOW, RIGHT?

31:13.202 --> 31:15.444
(continues laughing)

31:15.444 --> 31:17.106
RIGHT?

31:17.106 --> 31:18.307
YOU... WITH BAILEY?

31:18.307 --> 31:20.309
(continues laughing)

31:20.309 --> 31:22.111
(pager beeps)

31:22.111 --> 31:24.013
(laughs) YOU WANT A GRAPE?

31:24.013 --> 31:25.514
(laughs)

31:25.514 --> 31:27.316
WHOA-HO-HO.

31:27.316 --> 31:29.188
(sighs)
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:29.188 --> 31:31.220
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE RUN
THE C.T. WRONG OR SOMETHING,

31:31.220 --> 31:32.922
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
OVER 27 HOURS,

31:32.922 --> 31:34.493
AND SHE STILL
HASN'T CRIED YET.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.965
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

31:35.965 --> 31:37.326
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOUR KID ISN'T CRYING?

31:37.326 --> 31:38.597
BECAUSE SHE LIKES YOU.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.630
YOU'RE A GOOD DAD.
SHE'S HAPPY.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.102
YOU WANT TO SEE HER CRY?

31:44.133 --> 31:45.134
(crying)

31:45.134 --> 31:46.135
THERE.

31:46.135 --> 31:47.336
NOW SHE'S CRYING.

31:47.336 --> 31:49.108
(continues crying)

31:49.108 --> 31:51.280
(whispers) SHH.
IT'S OKAY.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.482
(normal voice)
IT'S OKAY.

31:53.482 --> 31:56.285
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

31:56.285 --> 31:59.288
(indistinct conversations)

32:01.150 --> 32:03.292
(clears throat)

32:06.255 --> 32:08.357
THEY LOOK HAPPY.

32:08.357 --> 32:10.259
YEAH, THEY DO.

32:10.259 --> 32:12.331
GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU
AT THE DECK TONIGHT.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.502
(elevator bell dings)

32:13.502 --> 32:15.264
CONFERENCE ROOM? COME ON.

32:15.264 --> 32:17.506
OH.

32:17.506 --> 32:19.668
THE GUY
WAS TWICE MY SIZE.

32:19.668 --> 32:22.211
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
I'M AN IDIOT.

32:22.211 --> 32:23.372
OR A HOBBIT.

32:23.372 --> 32:24.413
WHAT?

32:24.413 --> 32:25.614
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID,
RIGHT?

32:25.614 --> 32:27.276
WHEN HOBBITS FIND ADVENTURE,
THEY BECOME HEROES.

32:27.276 --> 32:28.517
YOU STEPPED UP.

32:28.517 --> 32:30.549
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU
GOT FLATTENED BY A GIANT.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.181
IT'S STILL COOL.

32:32.181 --> 32:34.953
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO THINKS SO.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.156
(grunts) ALL RIGHT.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.258
REMEMBER...

32:39.258 --> 32:41.090
(lowered voice) ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS SAY HI.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.161
LET HER DO THE REST.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.063
WAIT. WAIT. HANG ON.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.064
HEY.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.996
THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID,

32:46.996 --> 32:49.198
S-STANDING UP TO THAT GUY
THE OTHER DAY.

32:49.198 --> 32:51.040
THAT WAS SO BRAVE.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.341
I WAS A HOBBIT.

32:52.341 --> 32:54.343
OH...

32:54.343 --> 32:55.674
OKAY.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.107
UH, I'M NOT REALLY
FAMILIAR WITH HOBBITS,

32:58.107 --> 32:59.548
BUT ANYWAY, THAT...

32:59.548 --> 33:01.710
OKAY. THANK YOU. BYE.
(chuckles)

33:01.710 --> 33:03.312
(indistinct conversations)

33:03.312 --> 33:06.355
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO JUST SAYING HI?

33:06.355 --> 33:07.556
(indistinct conversations
continue)

33:07.556 --> 33:08.757
NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOBBITS?

33:08.757 --> 33:10.189
THEY'RE ONLY
THE CENTRAL FIGURES

33:10.189 --> 33:12.191
IN ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
PIECES OF LITERATURE IN HISTORY,

33:12.191 --> 33:13.692
NOT TO MENTION THE SUBJECT

33:13.692 --> 33:15.494
OF ONE OF THE HIGHEST-GROSSING
FILM FRANCHISES EVER,

33:15.494 --> 33:17.366
BUT, OKAY,
NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOBBITS.

33:17.366 --> 33:18.397
SURE.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.599
(elevator bell dings)

33:20.599 --> 33:21.670
HI.

33:24.133 --> 33:25.304
HEY.

33:27.076 --> 33:28.537
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:28.537 --> 33:30.339
YOU GET
THAT EAR PREPPED YET?

33:30.339 --> 33:32.741
(sighs) I MAY...

33:32.741 --> 33:34.743
HAVE TO SCRUB OUT
OF YOUR RHINOPLASTY

33:34.743 --> 33:37.046
JUST A LITTLE--JUST A LITTLE
EARLY TOMORROW

33:37.046 --> 33:38.387
IF THAT'S OKAY.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.089
YOU'RE IN MY LIGHT.

33:40.089 --> 33:42.391
UH, LAST NIGHT,
SHEPHERD ASKED ME

33:42.391 --> 33:44.393
TO SCRUB IN
ON HIS A.V.M. SURGERY,

33:44.393 --> 33:46.225
WHICH IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME,

33:46.225 --> 33:49.628
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA--HE'S GONNA
LET ME TAKE THE LEAD, SO--

33:49.628 --> 33:50.799
LAST NIGHT?

33:50.799 --> 33:52.161
YEAH.

33:52.161 --> 33:54.263
YOU WERE WITH SHEPHERD
LAST NIGHT? WHERE?

33:54.263 --> 33:55.404
OH, JUST...

33:55.404 --> 33:57.306
(speaks indistinctly)

33:57.306 --> 33:58.237
WHAT?

33:58.237 --> 33:59.568
HMM? AT HIS DECK.

33:59.568 --> 34:00.739
AT HIS DECK?

34:00.739 --> 34:02.271
YEAH.

34:02.271 --> 34:04.573
(beeping continues)

34:04.573 --> 34:06.445
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:06.445 --> 34:10.279
TAKING THE LEAD ON A SURGERY
IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY

34:10.279 --> 34:12.351
YOU SHOULD NOT PASS UP.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.253
THAT'S WHY...

34:14.253 --> 34:16.385
I'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE THE LEAD NOW.

34:16.385 --> 34:19.588
SEW THIS GUY'S EAR BACK ON
BY YOURSELF.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.596
THANK YOU.

34:27.596 --> 34:29.268
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.440
(exhales deeply)

34:33.071 --> 34:34.072
(door opens)

34:34.072 --> 34:35.073
(clears throat)

34:35.073 --> 34:36.375
HELLO. I'M DR. HUNT.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.448
I AM THE SURGEON WHO
REPAIRED YOUR BROKEN JAW.

34:39.448 --> 34:43.182
I AM ALSO THE GUY
WHO BROKE IT.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.654
UH, IT'S WIRED SHUT
RIGHT NOW SO, UH,

34:45.654 --> 34:47.356
I'LL DO THE TALKING.

34:47.356 --> 34:48.857
NOW THEY WANT ME
TO COME DOWN HERE

34:48.857 --> 34:50.589
AND APOLOGIZE TO YOU,

34:50.589 --> 34:52.591
AND I WANT
TO MAKE SOMETHING...

34:52.591 --> 34:54.463
QUITE CLEAR.

34:54.463 --> 34:56.395
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT
WHAT I DID.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.727
NOW I REVIEWED
THE SECURITY TAPE,

34:58.727 --> 35:00.299
AND I EASILY PREVENTED

35:00.299 --> 35:02.801
HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE
BEING INJURED BY YOU.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.274
YOU ASSAULTED A GIRL

35:05.274 --> 35:06.575
WITH A BEER BOTTLE.

35:06.575 --> 35:08.877
YOU ATTACKED
HOSPITAL STAFF.

35:08.877 --> 35:11.180
YOU PUT A MAN
ON THE CRITICAL LIST.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.311
YOU WERE VIOLENT
AND ABUSIVE

35:12.311 --> 35:13.812
IN FRONT OF
DOZENS OF WITNESSES,

35:13.812 --> 35:15.814
AND I WILL STAND UP
IN ANY COURT OF LAW

35:15.814 --> 35:19.218
AND SAY JUST THAT.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.390
I DO NOT APOLOGIZE
FOR THINGS I FEEL GOOD ABOUT,

35:21.390 --> 35:24.423
AND I FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THIS.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.255
SO...
(grunting)

35:26.255 --> 35:27.696
IF YOU WANT TO SUE,

35:27.696 --> 35:29.328
YOU SUE.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.330
(continues grunting)

35:31.330 --> 35:33.332
(panting)

35:34.563 --> 35:36.865
AND GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR RECOVERY.

35:47.516 --> 35:49.618
TAKE A LOOK.

35:49.618 --> 35:51.620
DR. JASON MAYFIELD...

35:51.620 --> 35:53.722
E.D. SPECIALIST?

35:53.722 --> 35:56.325
ROOM 22.
MAYFIELD IN 22.

35:56.325 --> 35:58.857
YOU TOLD BAILEY YOU HAD
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.490
(chuckles)
YOU TOLD SHEPHERD.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.462
S--
(elevator bell dings)

36:03.462 --> 36:05.234
OH, HEY, KAREV.
THERE YOU ARE.

36:05.234 --> 36:06.795
JUST READ YOUR PAPER.

36:06.795 --> 36:09.298
EXCELLENT FIRST DRAFT.

36:09.298 --> 36:10.699
OH, UH, AND, UH...

36:10.699 --> 36:12.701
(lowered voice)
DON'T HANG OUT BY MAYFIELD.

36:12.701 --> 36:14.172
PEOPLE GET THE WRONG IDEA.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.704
YEAH.

36:20.409 --> 36:22.651
AH, THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC,
KEITH.

36:24.783 --> 36:28.287
YOU SHOULD HAVE
VERY MINIMAL SCARRING.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.758
(Keith) OH.

36:29.758 --> 36:30.959
GO AWAY.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.761
NO.

36:32.761 --> 36:33.962
SORRY? I'VE GOT A BAD EAR.

36:33.962 --> 36:36.525
PRETTY SURE
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT RIGHT.

36:36.525 --> 36:38.697
OKAY, YEAH,
I SOLD THE TARDIS.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.430
BUT AS YOUR FRIEND,
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

36:41.430 --> 36:42.701
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.934
OUR PLACE IS CRAMMED WITH
ALL THAT STUFF YOU COLLECT.

36:45.934 --> 36:48.737
YOU SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY
ON IT. YOU'RE BROKE.

36:48.737 --> 36:50.739
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY MEDICAL BILLS

36:50.739 --> 36:52.241
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE?

36:52.241 --> 36:53.782
THAT TARDIS WAS WORTH CASH--

36:53.782 --> 36:56.214
REAL ACTUAL CASH--
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.488
SO, YEAH, I AM SORRY THAT
I SOLD YOUR PRECIOUS TARDIS.

36:59.488 --> 37:01.390
I AM.

37:01.390 --> 37:03.752
BUT I DID IT FOR YOU.

37:09.828 --> 37:13.502
WHO'D YOU SELL IT TO,
ANYWAY?

37:13.502 --> 37:15.764
THE GUY WITH THE COMIC STORE.
THE ONE IN SAN DIEGO.

37:15.764 --> 37:16.765
MORRIS?

37:16.765 --> 37:18.807
UGH. I HATE THAT GUY.

37:18.807 --> 37:20.539
HOW MUCH DID YOU GET
FOR IT?

37:20.539 --> 37:21.910
$7,500.

37:23.972 --> 37:27.446
WELL, HE RIPPED YOU OFF.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.747
(people speaking indistinctly)

37:28.747 --> 37:30.819
(door opens)

37:30.819 --> 37:32.851
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

37:32.851 --> 37:34.853
THE CHIEF BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF MY PAPER.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.885
I BASICALLY HAVE TO START
ALL OVER.

37:36.885 --> 37:38.287
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

37:38.287 --> 37:39.988
I AM BACK WHERE I STARTED
THREE DAYS AGO--

37:39.988 --> 37:41.690
NO PAPER, NO NEURO CASES.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.392
I MEAN, IT SUCKS.

37:43.392 --> 37:44.663
(sighs)

37:44.663 --> 37:46.295
GRAB YOUR COAT.

37:46.295 --> 37:49.698
♪♪♪

37:56.745 --> 37:58.046
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

37:58.046 --> 37:59.748
SHEPHERD HATES ME.

37:59.748 --> 38:01.049
I HATE THE WOODS.

38:01.049 --> 38:03.482
YOU KNOW THERE ARE
BEARS OUT HERE?

38:03.482 --> 38:05.654
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

38:05.654 --> 38:08.387
I-I BROUGHT KAREV.

38:12.721 --> 38:15.424
FIFTH YEAR
IS REALLY KICKING MY ASS.

38:15.424 --> 38:17.926
(sighs) I MEAN,
IT'S NO EXCUSE, ALL RIGHT?

38:17.926 --> 38:21.330
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL OR WHATEVER.

38:21.330 --> 38:23.402
ALSO, I LIED ABOUT MAYFIELD,

38:23.402 --> 38:24.933
JUST TO BE CLEAR.

38:24.933 --> 38:26.935
(chuckles)

38:30.609 --> 38:31.980
(scoffs)

38:36.345 --> 38:38.016
(Mark) DEREK.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.489
YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL
MY GUY.

38:40.489 --> 38:43.091
HE'SMYGUY.
AVERY, GO GET IN THE CAR.

38:43.091 --> 38:44.453
WHAT? NO.
MARK--

38:44.453 --> 38:45.994
YOU'VE BEEN MOVING IN
ON HIM ALL WEEK.

38:45.994 --> 38:47.356
YOU WEREN'T EVEN
INTERESTED IN HIM

38:47.356 --> 38:48.927
TILL YOU SAW
HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO ME.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.999
I DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO TEACH
ANYONEIF I CAN HELP IT.

38:50.999 --> 38:52.100
MARK--

38:52.100 --> 38:53.732
BUT I'M TAKING THE TIME
WITH AVERY

38:53.732 --> 38:55.364
BECAUSE HE'S A QUICK LEARNER

38:55.364 --> 38:57.766
AND HE CAN DO A Z-PLASTY BETTER
THAN I COULD AT HIS LEVEL.

38:57.766 --> 38:59.508
(Sofia fusses)
I CAN?

38:59.508 --> 39:01.009
HEY, HEY, DON'T DO THAT.

39:01.009 --> 39:03.612
DON'T--DON'T JUST
YELL AT ME, THEN WALK AWAY.
I'M NOT.

39:03.612 --> 39:05.714
IT'S JUST, SOFIA LIKES IT
IF I'M MOVING.

39:05.714 --> 39:06.715
OH.

39:06.715 --> 39:07.976
(Owen) YOU GUYS TALK.

39:07.976 --> 39:10.919
I'LL TAKE THE BABY.

39:10.919 --> 39:12.921
OKAY, CAREFUL. WE HAD
A SCARE THIS WEEK.

39:12.921 --> 39:13.922
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

39:13.922 --> 39:15.884
NOW...

39:15.884 --> 39:17.355
(Sofia coos)

39:17.355 --> 39:18.857
THANK YOU.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.089
AVERY, GO GET IN THE CAR!

39:21.089 --> 39:22.831
(lowered voice)
HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT?

39:22.831 --> 39:25.964
YOU GOOD? YOU WANT TO COME
AND SIT WITH ME?

39:25.964 --> 39:26.965
HERE WE GO.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.997
WE'RE JUST GONNA
SIT RIGHT HERE

39:28.997 --> 39:31.039
AND HAVE A LOOK
AT THE LITTLE TREE UP THERE.

39:31.039 --> 39:32.901
FRIENDS DON'T STEAL
FROM EACH OTHER.

39:32.901 --> 39:35.974
IT'S NOT STEALING IF HE ASKS
TO SCRUB IN ON MY SURGERY.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.606
OH, DON'T BE A JACKASS.

I CHOOSE PLASTICS.

I MEAN, I REALLY APPRECIATE

39:42.781 --> 39:43.952
BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD
ON YOUR NEUROSURGERIES,

39:43.952 --> 39:46.485
BUT I FEEL LIKE--
YOU USING MY BOY HERE

39:46.485 --> 39:47.856
TO GET MORE SURGERY?

39:47.856 --> 39:50.659
NOBODY USES MY BOY.

39:53.562 --> 39:55.163
WHY ARE WE THE ONLY ONES
WITH HAMMERS?
