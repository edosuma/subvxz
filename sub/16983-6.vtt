00:03.404 --> 00:05.444
The symbol of the egg

00:05.540 --> 00:07.670
is a worldwide symbol.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.875
It is more widespread than the cross.

00:09.978 --> 00:12.378
It was something that
contained great power,

00:12.480 --> 00:15.650
that could conceivably be released.

00:15.750 --> 00:19.320
It seems to point
to our source of origin.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.690
You have to wonder now,

00:20.788 --> 00:23.018
if we're coming to much
the same conclusion

00:23.124 --> 00:24.924
as was already reached

00:25.026 --> 00:26.626
thousands of years ago.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.662
Where are they getting this information?

00:31.199 --> 00:33.169
Is it coming from extraterrestrials?

00:34.569 --> 00:37.439
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:37.538 --> 00:39.938
mankind has credited its origins

00:40.041 --> 00:44.881
to gods and other
visitors from the stars.

00:44.979 --> 00:49.419
What if it were true?
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:49.517 --> 00:52.787
really help to shape our history?

00:52.887 --> 00:56.017
And if so, might the truth be found

00:56.124 --> 00:58.824
once we decode the Cosmic Egg?

# Ancient Aliens 11x06 #
Decoding The Cosmic Egg
Original Air Date on June 17, 2016

01:29.023 --> 01:33.463
An ancient painting
on a cave wall in Africa.

01:33.561 --> 01:37.901
Ceremonial clay objects
discovered in Sweden.

01:37.999 --> 01:40.729
A mysterious sculpture found in China.

01:40.835 --> 01:44.335
Throughout the ancient world,

01:44.439 --> 01:47.969
there is a symbol that is
more pervasive than any other:

01:48.076 --> 01:50.636
the symbol of the egg.

01:54.549 --> 01:58.349
The egg is one of the most
universal sacred images.

01:58.453 --> 02:00.053
It is more widespread than the cross,

02:00.154 --> 02:02.824
or the star, or the wheel.

02:02.924 --> 02:05.364
It appeals to people in
all corners of the Earth,

02:05.460 --> 02:08.990
and all times, and traditions.

02:09.097 --> 02:12.597
We found stone eggs all over the world.

02:12.700 --> 02:17.370
For example, stone eggs
were found in Egypt.

02:17.472 --> 02:21.972
And even on Easter Island,
a stone egg was found.

02:22.076 --> 02:26.046
So the symbol of egg
is a worldwide symbol.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.322
What's amazing is that the egg,

02:30.418 --> 02:32.748
what we call the egg cosmogony,

02:32.854 --> 02:35.824
is a feature of several cosmogonies.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.923
We have it in the Nordic tradition.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.986
We have it in the
Mediterranean tradition,

02:41.095 --> 02:42.725
not only Greco-Roman,

02:42.830 --> 02:46.930
but Egyptian and also
the Phoenician mythologies.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.074
We also have it in some Middle Eastern,

02:49.170 --> 02:51.800
and even Vedic mythologies.

02:51.906 --> 02:55.636
So these are radically
different cultures.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.548
Is it possible that
there's a common origin

02:59.647 --> 03:01.677
for South American,

03:01.783 --> 03:06.693
Native American, Norse,
and Vedic mythology?

03:06.788 --> 03:08.818
We have no evidence.

03:08.923 --> 03:13.563
So it would be hard to say
where they come from,

03:13.661 --> 03:16.031
and why they all use this image.

03:17.932 --> 03:21.402
Why is it that so many ancient cultures,

03:21.502 --> 03:24.502
separated by thousands of miles,

03:24.605 --> 03:26.765
all use the symbol of the egg?

03:28.576 --> 03:31.706
For one thing, obviously,
it is associated with birth.

03:31.813 --> 03:35.353
Well, birth is a great mystery,
so it's the worship of life.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.919
It is also taken as a symbol of rebirth.

03:38.019 --> 03:40.549
We use it at the Easter time,
in the spring.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.790
The cultures that birthed these stories

03:44.892 --> 03:50.762
recognized something
in the story of birth,

03:50.865 --> 03:54.095
of creation, of fertility,
of reproduction,

03:54.202 --> 03:56.772
that was meaningful for their stories.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.936
While the most obvious
interpretation of the egg is

04:02.043 --> 04:06.753
that it symbolizes fertility and
the natural creation of life,

04:06.848 --> 04:08.578
some researchers question

04:08.683 --> 04:11.353
why there are so many depictions of eggs

04:11.452 --> 04:13.322
found throughout the ancient world

04:13.421 --> 04:16.921
that depict humans emerging from them.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.894
We have these many stories
from around the world

04:19.994 --> 04:24.664
of how life starts
in the form of an egg,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.795
including human life, too,

04:26.901 --> 04:29.401
starting with a sperm and an egg.

04:29.503 --> 04:33.343
But how would ancient
people realize that

04:33.441 --> 04:37.011
humans also have these eggs?

04:38.913 --> 04:40.753
Could ancient people have somehow

04:40.848 --> 04:44.618
had the knowledge that
humans emerge from eggs?

04:44.719 --> 04:47.449
Or might this symbol
have held a less literal,

04:47.555 --> 04:50.955
and more profound, meaning for them...

04:51.058 --> 04:54.858
one that reveals an
extraterrestrial connection?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.957
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

04:59.066 --> 05:01.296
that the stories connected to the egg

05:01.402 --> 05:03.772
provide undeniable evidence

05:03.871 --> 05:08.771
that this was not simply
a representation of fertility.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.276
Nearly as widespread
as the symbol of the egg

05:11.379 --> 05:15.979
is a concept commonly
known as "The Cosmic Egg."

05:16.083 --> 05:18.923
While the name varies
from culture to culture,

05:19.020 --> 05:22.490
the story is always nearly identical:

05:22.590 --> 05:26.060
that the entire Universe
originated from an Egg.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.330
They're called cosmic eggs,

05:28.429 --> 05:31.399
they're called silver eggs,
they're called magic eggs,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.299
they're called enchanted eggs,

05:33.401 --> 05:35.801
they're-they're called
the-the eggs of the gods.

05:35.903 --> 05:40.843
I mean, all around the world,
there are these creation stories

05:40.942 --> 05:46.412
of the egg breaking open and
the water of life coming out.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.654
In Chinese mythology,
there is, uh, this notion

05:49.750 --> 05:55.020
that the-the universe emerges
out of a primordial chaos.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.722
And this primordial chaos,

05:57.825 --> 06:01.325
in many accounts, is self-contained.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.959
It's like a cosmic egg.

06:04.065 --> 06:06.595
And from this primordial chaos,

06:06.701 --> 06:10.741
which contains everything,
the universe is generated.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.868
And first, it divides into
two principles: Yin and Yang,

06:13.975 --> 06:16.875
and then three, and then 10,000,

06:16.978 --> 06:19.478
basically, ad infinitum.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.480
Hindus have thought about
the expansion of the universe

06:23.584 --> 06:25.354
in the shape of an egg.

06:25.453 --> 06:29.523
"Brahmanda" is a Sanskrit term
composed of two words:

06:29.623 --> 06:31.763
"Brahma" and "Anda."

06:31.859 --> 06:33.729
And "Brahma" means "creator god,"

06:33.828 --> 06:35.588
"Anda" means "egg."

06:35.696 --> 06:37.896
So it is actually "cosmic egg."

06:39.734 --> 06:44.404
Many different ancient cultures
describe a creation myth

06:44.505 --> 06:50.535
in which the universe actually
hatches out of an egg.

06:52.913 --> 06:57.553
It is incredible
to look at the sheer diversity

06:57.651 --> 07:00.691
of different teachings,
that all point back to the idea

07:00.788 --> 07:02.018
that the universe originated

07:02.123 --> 07:06.363
from some sort of primordial centrality.

07:08.396 --> 07:10.526
The story found, in numerous cultures,

07:10.631 --> 07:11.961
of the cosmic egg,

07:12.066 --> 07:13.796
representing a central point

07:13.901 --> 07:15.931
from which the universe exploded,

07:16.037 --> 07:19.437
has led some to ask
if this might actually be

07:19.540 --> 07:25.840
a description of what scientists
today call "The Big Bang."

07:25.946 --> 07:28.706
In 1931, Belgian
astronomer George Lemaitre

07:28.816 --> 07:30.876
proposed that the entire universe

07:30.985 --> 07:34.985
originated in one single point.

07:35.089 --> 07:36.689
He called it the "primeval atom."

07:36.791 --> 07:38.291
This primeval atom,

07:38.392 --> 07:41.292
he also referred to it as a cosmic egg,

07:41.395 --> 07:44.025
that was at the beginning
of all of creation.

07:49.403 --> 07:53.443
The question is: how did our
ancestors know about this?

07:53.541 --> 07:57.781
Was it just a hunch or was
it that they were told?

07:57.878 --> 08:01.778
If somebody told them that means
we're not alone in the universe.

08:01.882 --> 08:02.882
End of story.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.415
You have to wonder now,

08:06.520 --> 08:09.490
if we're coming
to much the same conclusion

08:09.590 --> 08:12.990
as was already reached
thousands of years ago,

08:13.094 --> 08:14.694
in the Sanskrit texts.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.325
Where are they getting this information?

08:17.431 --> 08:19.871
Is it coming from extraterrestrials?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.903
Might the symbol of the Cosmic Egg,

08:25.005 --> 08:28.565
and the creation stories
that go along with it,

08:28.676 --> 08:31.876
reveal that our ancestors
had scientific knowledge

08:31.979 --> 08:34.279
of how the Earth and, in fact,

08:34.381 --> 08:38.280
our entire universe, was created?

08:38.385 --> 08:40.544
And if so, is it possible

08:40.654 --> 08:44.664
that this was taught to them
by extraterrestrial visitors?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.833
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that,

08:48.929 --> 08:50.999
while this is one possibility,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.768
there may be a more tangible explanation

08:53.868 --> 08:56.838
for the concept of the Cosmic Egg--

08:56.937 --> 09:00.537
one that is connected
directly to the arrival

09:00.641 --> 09:03.081
of extraterrestrial visitors.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.807
Coming up...

09:08.916 --> 09:11.816
They said specifically, these eggs...

09:11.919 --> 09:14.519
they came from out there.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.562
It suggests that extraterrestrials

09:16.657 --> 09:18.657
influenced their civilization.

09:25.082 --> 09:27.222
Mali, West Africa.

09:28.786 --> 09:32.686
Here, hidden within
the Cliff of Bandiagara,

09:32.790 --> 09:37.360
lie hundreds of villages
occupied by the Dogon people.

09:37.461 --> 09:40.601
Believed to be the
descendants of the Egyptians,

09:40.698 --> 09:44.028
archaeologists say
the ancient nomadic tribe

09:44.134 --> 09:47.974
settled in this region around 1000 AD.

09:49.907 --> 09:51.767
Like many other ancient cultures,

09:51.875 --> 09:56.445
the creation story of the Dogon
involves a Cosmic Egg.

09:58.148 --> 10:01.318
In West Africa, the Dogon creation myth

10:01.418 --> 10:05.718
is that the earliest divinity, Amma,

10:05.823 --> 10:09.633
the god of all things,
took the form of an egg,

10:09.727 --> 10:13.027
and this is what unfolded
to become creation.

10:13.130 --> 10:16.370
When the egg opened,
it became a whirlwind

10:16.467 --> 10:19.937
and scattered its contents
in all directions.

10:22.373 --> 10:26.913
This ultimately formed all of
the galaxies and planets.

10:29.246 --> 10:32.376
The Dogon say that
their gods, called the Nommo,

10:32.483 --> 10:35.083
came down to Earth in Cosmic Eggs...

10:36.754 --> 10:38.894
...and when descending from the sky,

10:38.989 --> 10:41.089
they made the ground tremble.

10:42.326 --> 10:43.986
They said specifically--

10:44.094 --> 10:46.664
these eggs, they came from out there.

10:46.764 --> 10:50.004
They came from the vastness of the dark,

10:50.100 --> 10:51.800
the vastness of the cold.

10:53.303 --> 10:56.813
Well, what a more poetic way
to describe space?

11:00.778 --> 11:02.738
The Dogon said that they

11:02.846 --> 11:05.176
originated from the star Sirius B.

11:05.282 --> 11:06.822
What's interesting about that

11:06.917 --> 11:08.947
is that we didn't even discover Sirius B

11:09.053 --> 11:10.623
until 40 years after

11:10.721 --> 11:12.891
the Dogon published
originally, this story,

11:12.990 --> 11:16.260
which is, of course, much more ancient.

11:18.362 --> 11:21.632
It suggests that the Cosmic Egg
is a symbol for the craft

11:21.732 --> 11:24.272
of these extraterrestrials,
who the Dogon said

11:24.368 --> 11:27.998
came to Earth from Sirius and
influenced their civilization.

11:31.075 --> 11:34.635
Could the Dogon have
been given knowledge of Sirius B

11:34.745 --> 11:39.875
by extraterrestrials that came
to Earth in egg-shaped crafts?

11:42.152 --> 11:45.692
Might the Cosmic Egg
not only represent knowledge

11:45.789 --> 11:47.789
of how the universe was formed,

11:47.891 --> 11:50.761
but the actual vehicles
primitive people witnessed

11:50.861 --> 11:52.831
descending from the sky?

11:55.499 --> 11:58.369
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

11:58.469 --> 12:02.039
and suggest there is evidence
that similar craft

12:02.139 --> 12:05.009
have even been witnessed
in modern times.

12:09.213 --> 12:12.653
April 24, 1964.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.320
6:00 p.m.

12:14.418 --> 12:16.378
Socorro, New Mexico.

12:18.722 --> 12:20.622
While chasing a speeding car,

12:20.724 --> 12:23.864
police sergeant Lonnie Zamora
hears a loud roar,

12:23.961 --> 12:28.361
and sees a flame in
the sky, to the southwest.

12:28.465 --> 12:32.165
Thinking a local dynamite
shack might have exploded,

12:32.269 --> 12:36.469
Zamora breaks off
the chase to investigate.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.705
He headed off to where

12:39.810 --> 12:42.110
he thought the explosion had come from.

12:43.147 --> 12:45.277
As he got to the site,

12:45.382 --> 12:47.722
he saw an egg-shaped object,

12:47.818 --> 12:50.818
standing on a tripod leg formation

12:50.921 --> 12:54.761
with two small creatures outside
of it, in white overalls.

12:56.059 --> 12:58.129
According to his account,

12:58.228 --> 13:00.828
as Zamora began to approach on foot,

13:00.931 --> 13:04.871
the creatures quickly jumped
inside the egg-shaped vehicle,

13:04.968 --> 13:08.368
and it lifted off into the sky,
in a column of fire.

13:10.941 --> 13:14.741
Of course, by the time backup
arrived, the object had gone.

13:16.747 --> 13:19.077
But fortunately, the landing marks,

13:19.183 --> 13:23.653
where the craft had come down
were still visible,

13:23.754 --> 13:25.124
clearly demonstrating

13:25.222 --> 13:27.192
that something had touched to the ground

13:27.291 --> 13:29.831
and had left the ground again
and took to the skies.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.987
Within days,

13:32.095 --> 13:34.955
a team of investigators from the FBI,

13:35.065 --> 13:38.665
the Air Force and the nearby
White Sands Missile Range

13:38.769 --> 13:41.799
examined the site.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.965
As soon as the media
picked up the story,

13:44.074 --> 13:48.414
more witnesses came forward
with similar descriptions.

13:49.012 --> 13:52.482
It made headlines around the
world, because J. Allen Hynek,

13:52.582 --> 13:56.582
who was then head
of The Center for UFO Studies,

13:56.686 --> 13:58.186
and who had been working
for the Air Force

13:58.288 --> 14:02.418
on the study of UFO investigations...

14:02.525 --> 14:04.725
he got in touch with Lonnie Zamora,

14:04.828 --> 14:08.428
and arranged to come to the ground.

14:08.531 --> 14:11.601
Dr. J. Allen Hynek was
very much a skeptic of

14:11.701 --> 14:15.601
the UFO phenomenon
and arguably, in some cases,

14:15.705 --> 14:17.635
even a debunker of the phenomenon.

14:17.741 --> 14:21.641
To a great degree,
that changed when he looked into

14:21.745 --> 14:26.605
the Zamora case and, ironically,
he ultimately swung around

14:26.716 --> 14:29.716
and became a full-on
believer in the UFO phenomenon.

14:30.319 --> 14:32.549
The incident immediately became

14:32.655 --> 14:34.715
a part of Project Blue Book,

14:34.824 --> 14:39.564
a special Air Force operation
that began in 1952,

14:39.662 --> 14:42.502
to catalogue
and investigate the sightings

14:42.599 --> 14:44.869
of unidentified flying objects.

14:46.569 --> 14:49.499
Although publicly,
Project Blue Book downplayed

14:49.606 --> 14:51.636
the entire UFO phenomenon,

14:51.741 --> 14:54.181
and certainly
the Zamora case in particular,

14:54.277 --> 14:55.637
behind the scenes,

14:55.745 --> 14:58.675
something very, very different
was going on.

14:58.782 --> 15:00.722
Major Hector Quintanilla,

15:00.817 --> 15:03.477
the boss of Project Blue Book
at the time,

15:03.586 --> 15:07.616
prepared a secret memo
for the attention of the CIA,

15:07.724 --> 15:11.294
and essentially,
the memo said there was no doubt

15:11.394 --> 15:13.564
that Zamora had seen something unusual;

15:13.663 --> 15:18.273
something from somewhere else
had touched down on our planet.

15:18.368 --> 15:20.498
We have a shiny metallic object

15:20.603 --> 15:21.703
in the shape of an egg.

15:21.805 --> 15:23.835
There are multiple eyewitnesses

15:23.940 --> 15:26.610
that actually say they
saw this and there are

15:26.709 --> 15:31.249
hundreds of witnesses
who heard this roaring sound.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.407
We have landing traces.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.746
There's so much evidence,
it's unbelievable.

15:39.222 --> 15:42.562
Could Sergeant Zamora
have had a similar encounter

15:42.659 --> 15:45.989
to what the Dogon say
their ancestors witnessed,

15:46.095 --> 15:49.025
thousands of years ago?

15:49.132 --> 15:53.232
And if so, might this mean
that the Cosmic Egg

15:53.336 --> 15:57.306
represented not just the
beginning of the universe,

15:57.407 --> 16:00.537
but also the craft used by the beings

16:00.643 --> 16:03.513
that gave our ancestors this knowledge?

16:04.614 --> 16:07.154
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest 

16:07.350 --> 16:11.250
there is even more to the
meaning of this universal icon,

16:11.354 --> 16:15.994
and that additional clues can be
found by examining a stone egg

16:16.092 --> 16:19.362
that bears another mysterious symbol.

16:20.764 --> 16:22.404
Coming up...

16:22.499 --> 16:23.499
If you looked through

16:23.600 --> 16:25.000
the hole in these stones,

16:25.102 --> 16:27.872
you would be able to see
supernatural creatures.

16:27.971 --> 16:30.371
What if this Druid stone

16:30.474 --> 16:33.144
was an extraterrestrial type of device?

16:39.331 --> 16:41.271
Silves, Portugal.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.497
1984.

16:44.603 --> 16:47.173
Farmers digging a well for agriculture,

16:47.273 --> 16:49.873
on land overlooking the ancient harbor,

16:49.975 --> 16:56.145
come across a mysterious object
15 feet beneath the Earth--

16:56.248 --> 16:59.478
a six-foot-long limestone egg
with a mysterious design,

16:59.585 --> 17:04.214
protruding from its surface
in three places.

17:04.323 --> 17:08.262
The egg has been dated
to at least 3,500 BC,

17:08.359 --> 17:12.500
and scientists conclude
it could be even older.

17:16.602 --> 17:21.002
Today, the Algarve Egg is on
display in the Lagos Museum,

17:21.106 --> 17:24.935
19 miles from where it was discovered.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.784
Author Peter Daughtrey has
studied the egg meticulously,

17:28.881 --> 17:31.521
in an attempt to discover the story

17:31.617 --> 17:35.847
behind this mysterious stone artifact.

17:35.955 --> 17:39.885
How does this museum
classify this stone?

17:39.992 --> 17:43.262
They classify it as a menhir,
a standing stone,

17:43.362 --> 17:48.232
which there are many all the way
up the west coast of Portugal;

17:48.334 --> 17:51.804
France, Brittany and into
the Gaelic countries,

17:51.904 --> 17:54.444
Ireland, Wales, Scotland.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.810
Most of them are just big lumps of stone

17:57.910 --> 17:59.510
that have been dug up and-and erected

17:59.612 --> 18:01.252
with a little bit of shaping.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.147
As you can see,
this is a lot more than just

18:04.250 --> 18:05.550
a simple stone that's been dug up.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.251
It's-it's really a piece of sculpture,

18:07.353 --> 18:09.223
or was a piece of sculpture.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.521
Which is very interesting

18:10.623 --> 18:13.323
to see these different eggs

18:13.425 --> 18:17.155
or these navels or omphalos,
from all around the world--

18:17.263 --> 18:18.403
Symbols of creation.

18:18.497 --> 18:19.957
Mm-hmm. Exactly.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.155
Everybody, every race has one.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.067
There is... there's an interesting,

18:23.168 --> 18:24.938
old legend, a Slavic legend,

18:25.037 --> 18:27.767
from areas like Bosnia and Yugoslavia,

18:27.873 --> 18:31.443
which says that they
originally came from a,

18:31.544 --> 18:34.444
a land in the western ocean, which sank.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.347
Interesting.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.048
And the center of
their religion on the island

18:39.151 --> 18:42.051
was a large white egg; stone egg.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.094
This was white.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.318
You can see it's been buried,

18:44.423 --> 18:45.993
it's got the earth discoloring it,

18:46.091 --> 18:47.861
but it's sand-- white sandstone.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.930
We're talking of something
that's-that's incredibly old.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.330
And this thing, up the middle here,

18:53.432 --> 18:56.202
all the, uh, resemble the rod,

18:56.302 --> 18:57.772
which throughout history,

18:57.870 --> 19:02.770
has been a symbol of power
and of creation.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.905
Moses had a rod.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.810
And in Mesopotamia, the rod was regarded

19:07.913 --> 19:10.253
as the symbol of the power of the gods.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.079
If you look at this,

19:12.184 --> 19:16.524
this could be referred to
as the origin of that staff

19:16.622 --> 19:19.892
that is used in medicine
with the snake around it.

19:22.261 --> 19:26.201
In Greek mythology,
Asclepius, the god of medicine,

19:26.298 --> 19:29.398
is always depicted with
a serpent-entwined rod.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.800
And the Greek caduceus,

19:33.906 --> 19:36.966
a staff carried by
the messenger god Hermes,

19:37.076 --> 19:40.236
consists of two serpents intertwined,

19:40.346 --> 19:44.106
closely resembling the
design on the Algarve Egg.

19:46.318 --> 19:50.448
While the snake and egg are both
considered fertility symbols,

19:50.556 --> 19:53.116
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

19:53.225 --> 19:56.625
that the combination of the two
may hold another meaning.

19:58.497 --> 20:02.697
They believe it may represent
extraterrestrial technology...

20:06.138 --> 20:09.068
...and as evidence,
point to the Druid's Egg,

20:09.174 --> 20:11.384
or "snake stone."

20:15.014 --> 20:18.024
Druid eggs are oval or roundish stones,

20:18.117 --> 20:22.317
often made of a calcinatious
material, like this.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.964
According to Pliny the Elder,

20:27.059 --> 20:30.859
these druid eggs were
used to cure illness,

20:30.963 --> 20:34.533
and if you looked through
the hole in these stones,

20:34.633 --> 20:38.203
you would be able to see
supernatural creatures.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.573
Are we really just talking about

20:40.673 --> 20:44.513
a magical stone with magical properties?

20:44.610 --> 20:50.110
Or were these magical properties
actually rooted in reality?

20:50.215 --> 20:53.875
What if this Druid stone
was not necessarily

20:53.986 --> 20:56.246
just a ritual object,

20:56.355 --> 21:00.655
but that originally it was an
extraterrestrial type of device?

21:03.328 --> 21:04.828
Might the Druid's Egg

21:04.930 --> 21:09.230
have actually held otherworldly powers?

21:09.334 --> 21:11.574
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

21:11.670 --> 21:13.340
further clues can be found

21:13.439 --> 21:16.169
by examining another egg-shaped object

21:16.275 --> 21:20.575
that was said to connect humans
directly to the gods.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.117
Delphi, Greece.

21:28.220 --> 21:32.060
Standing in the center
of this archaeological complex

21:32.157 --> 21:36.457
is a stone artifact
known as an omphalos.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.362
The omphalos is carved with a pattern

21:38.464 --> 21:42.574
not unlike that found
on the Algarve Egg,

21:42.668 --> 21:46.438
only these lines
criss-cross the entire stone.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.241
It is thought to be
an ancient reproduction

21:51.343 --> 21:53.183
of the original omphalos that,

21:53.278 --> 21:56.608
according to the Greeks,
marked the "navel of the Earth."

22:00.452 --> 22:02.922
This here is a small-scale replica

22:03.021 --> 22:06.061
of the omphalos of the oracle in Delphi.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.359
It has these bizarre strands
on them, intertwining,

22:10.462 --> 22:13.762
and, in fact, the plaque at the place

22:13.866 --> 22:15.396
where this thing is located--

22:15.501 --> 22:20.541
it actually says that
this object fell from the sky,

22:20.639 --> 22:25.439
and afterwards, because of Zeus,
life began on Earth.

22:32.317 --> 22:34.017
According to Greek mythology,

22:34.119 --> 22:36.389
the celestial stone enabled

22:36.488 --> 22:40.518
direct communication with the gods.

22:40.626 --> 22:44.356
The Delphic tradition was
something like channeling.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.963
An oracle, a human being, a high priest,

22:47.065 --> 22:48.325
but still, a person,

22:48.433 --> 22:51.503
could receive the wisdom
directly from a god.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.465
And at the center of
this strange tradition

22:55.574 --> 22:59.014
was the omphalos egg.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.510
So you have to ask,
what was going on here?

23:03.615 --> 23:06.245
Why was the cosmic egg so important

23:06.351 --> 23:08.191
to these priestesses?

23:08.287 --> 23:11.247
And were they able to somehow use it

23:11.356 --> 23:14.386
as some technological device

23:14.493 --> 23:18.093
to stimulate their, their brains to,

23:18.197 --> 23:20.197
to make these predictions?

23:25.204 --> 23:28.104
Could the omphalos,
like the Druid's Egg,

23:28.207 --> 23:30.967
have been a technological
device that connected humans

23:31.076 --> 23:34.846
with otherworldly beings?

23:34.947 --> 23:38.517
And might these ancient stories
associated with the Cosmic Egg

23:38.617 --> 23:41.317
still hold a message today--

23:41.420 --> 23:43.520
that within us lies a connection

23:43.622 --> 23:46.362
to greater powers in the universe?

23:48.193 --> 23:51.803
Perhaps further clues can be
found by taking another look

23:51.897 --> 23:55.027
at the symbol on the Algarve Egg,

23:55.133 --> 23:57.133
and how it might be connected

23:57.236 --> 24:01.606
to a biological structure that
lies within the human body.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.536
Coming up...

24:05.644 --> 24:06.884
Here's something that's supposedly

24:06.979 --> 24:08.949
5,000 years old,

24:09.047 --> 24:11.277
and it has a double helix on it.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.953
That can be translated

24:13.051 --> 24:16.021
into one single word: seeding.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.121
The seeding of a planet.

24:22.769 --> 24:24.799
Almaty, Kazakhstan.

24:24.905 --> 24:27.965
May, 2013.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.281
Writing in the journal Icarus,

24:30.377 --> 24:34.507
scientists Vladimir Shcherbak
and Maxim Makukov

24:34.581 --> 24:36.551
make a shocking proposal:

24:36.650 --> 24:38.520
that there is an intelligent code

24:38.585 --> 24:42.845
that can be found in our own DNA.

24:42.956 --> 24:46.956
They concluded that
there was a certain amount

24:47.060 --> 24:49.360
of mathematical precision and...

24:49.462 --> 24:55.032
and what's known as digital
checking built into our DNA,

24:55.135 --> 24:57.335
like computer codes have--

24:57.404 --> 25:01.374
checking codes to make sure that
all the other codes are right.

25:01.474 --> 25:04.314
We now know that DNA's genetic code

25:04.411 --> 25:07.951
is an elegant language composed
of billions of characters,

25:08.048 --> 25:12.348
perfectly ordered, much like
computer machine language.

25:12.419 --> 25:15.549
But it is so complex, and so precise,

25:15.655 --> 25:20.525
that geneticists still don't
know where DNA came from.

25:20.594 --> 25:23.834
The two scientists claim
their research supports

25:23.930 --> 25:27.000
a controversial theory about
the origin of DNA

25:27.067 --> 25:30.437
that was first suggested
by Francis Crick,

25:30.537 --> 25:32.637
one of the two men responsible

25:32.706 --> 25:37.076
for discovering the structure
of the DNA molecule in 1953.

25:38.778 --> 25:41.478
In the article,
they went on to propose that

25:41.581 --> 25:44.451
our DNA didn't come from Earth.

25:44.517 --> 25:48.747
Their theory is cited as
evidence of Panspermia,

25:48.855 --> 25:52.315
or the idea that we were,
in fact, seeded from the stars.

25:52.425 --> 25:55.885
The basic premise of Directed Panspermia

25:55.996 --> 25:59.496
is that the building blocks
of life were sent to Earth

25:59.599 --> 26:02.729
by an advanced civilization
in the distant past.

26:02.802 --> 26:05.802
And ancient astronaut theorists suggest

26:05.905 --> 26:08.665
this may be part of
the message contained

26:08.775 --> 26:12.635
within the stories of the Cosmic Egg.

26:12.712 --> 26:17.322
All around the world, there
are stories of glowing eggs

26:17.417 --> 26:23.017
descending from the sky,
and out of which life began.

26:23.089 --> 26:27.329
And that can be translated
into one single word: seeding.

26:27.427 --> 26:29.627
The seeding of a planet.

26:31.364 --> 26:33.004
When we look at the Algarve egg,

26:33.099 --> 26:35.669
these intertwined snakes

26:35.735 --> 26:40.735
can also be interpreted as DNA strands.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.970
Here's something that's supposedly

26:43.076 --> 26:47.776
5,000 years old,
and it has a double helix on it.

26:47.881 --> 26:51.981
It seems to be symbolizing,
somehow, this cosmic egg,

26:52.085 --> 26:55.445
this cosmic creation that, that is...

26:55.555 --> 26:59.715
where all life and,
and humanity all started.

27:01.094 --> 27:03.364
Is it possible that the design found

27:03.463 --> 27:08.303
on the Algarve Egg represents
the structure of DNA?

27:08.401 --> 27:11.301
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

27:11.404 --> 27:14.974
and suggest that this
genetic symbol can be found

27:15.075 --> 27:17.835
throughout the ancient world.

27:19.646 --> 27:21.876
The DNA spiral is shown

27:21.948 --> 27:26.578
on different antique rocks and stelaes.

27:26.686 --> 27:29.986
Just, for example, look at
the Sumerian cylinder seals.

27:30.090 --> 27:35.290
There you see DNA spirals
between the gods,

27:35.395 --> 27:38.855
the same as some Sumerian stelaes.

27:38.965 --> 27:45.735
There you see so-called flying
geniuses or winged geniuses.

27:45.839 --> 27:48.769
Between these winged geniuses

27:48.875 --> 27:52.735
is something which archeology
calls the tree of life.

27:52.846 --> 27:54.946
But if you look at the tree of life

27:55.048 --> 27:59.548
it's in reality a DNA spiral.

27:59.652 --> 28:02.552
The two winged geniuses are working.

28:02.655 --> 28:06.885
They are changing out
information of the DNA,

28:06.960 --> 28:09.630
and replace it...

28:09.696 --> 28:11.996
by another information.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.225
The situation is absolutely clear,

28:14.334 --> 28:18.244
you just have to look at it
with today's eyes.

28:18.338 --> 28:22.438
It would seem that
this serpent and egg energy

28:22.509 --> 28:27.549
have to do with our sperm and eggs,

28:27.614 --> 28:32.824
and the DNA helix which
is intertwined serpents.

28:32.886 --> 28:38.256
So how would ancient
people know about this?

28:38.358 --> 28:40.688
Did it come from extraterrestrials?

28:42.529 --> 28:45.699
The Cosmic Egg,
the entwined serpents, DNA,

28:45.799 --> 28:48.269
are all ultimately representative

28:48.334 --> 28:50.774
of the symbols of humanity itself,

28:50.870 --> 28:54.470
and the creation of humanity
by extraterrestrial beings.

28:55.541 --> 28:57.741
One place where we can
see this in action

28:57.811 --> 29:00.781
is with the Archangel Gabriel,

29:00.880 --> 29:05.520
who wields a caduceus wand
at the Annunciation scenes

29:05.618 --> 29:08.348
in which Gabriel
appears to the Virgin Mary

29:08.454 --> 29:11.894
and announces that she
will bear the Christ Child.

29:11.991 --> 29:15.331
This is suggestive of
genetic manipulation

29:15.428 --> 29:18.958
with the caduceus being the
symbol of a group of god beings,

29:19.065 --> 29:23.725
angelic beings who had a hand
in manipulating human affairs.

29:26.105 --> 29:29.635
Could the mysterious
symbol found on the Algarve Egg

29:29.742 --> 29:32.742
have been left as a clue
that we are the product

29:32.812 --> 29:36.712
of genetic manipulation
by extraterrestrials?

29:36.816 --> 29:38.576
Might this explain why there are

29:38.651 --> 29:42.091
historical depictions of
humans hatching from eggs?

29:43.423 --> 29:46.623
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

29:46.726 --> 29:48.156
but propose that the story

29:48.261 --> 29:51.761
of the Cosmic Egg
has yet another chapter,

29:51.831 --> 29:54.971
one that can only be
understood by examining

29:55.068 --> 29:59.638
a biological structure that may
play the most important role

29:59.705 --> 30:02.705
in what it means to be human.

30:05.744 --> 30:07.014
Coming up...

30:07.113 --> 30:08.653
You wonder was it in fact a gift

30:08.748 --> 30:11.778
from extraterrestrial beings
that awakened us?

30:11.885 --> 30:14.815
Our creators have designed a tool

30:14.921 --> 30:18.221
to help us become greater
than we are today.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.724
Throughout the world,
there are ancient traditions

30:25.823 --> 30:28.223
that identify the center of the head

30:28.326 --> 30:32.626
as being synonymous with
the center of the Earth...

30:32.730 --> 30:35.630
the center of the universe...

30:35.733 --> 30:39.373
and the very center of creation itself.

30:39.470 --> 30:42.810
This center is often
depicted as egg-shaped,

30:42.907 --> 30:47.907
and is identified in some
cultures as the third eye.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.808
There are multiple cultures

30:51.916 --> 30:54.616
that point us in this same direction.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.089
The Hindus have it
as the third eye, or the bindi.

30:58.189 --> 31:02.289
The Buddhists have the third
eye on Buddha's forehead.

31:02.393 --> 31:06.833
We see symbology in Mesoamerica
which seems to symbolize

31:06.931 --> 31:09.131
the ability to contact and communicate

31:09.233 --> 31:11.333
with the higher spiritual realms,

31:11.436 --> 31:15.866
using this secret symbol
that is consistent

31:15.973 --> 31:17.413
throughout all
the major world religions.

31:19.277 --> 31:23.947
When you talk about the third
eye, it's about enlightenment.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.678
It's about this connection
to the great unknown

31:26.784 --> 31:30.324
or the force of the universe.

31:32.023 --> 31:33.923
We think that we are
separated from the world,

31:34.025 --> 31:36.225
when in reality, we are all connected

31:36.327 --> 31:38.927
to every single object
in the universe...

31:39.030 --> 31:43.130
and that inherently means that
we are directly connected to

31:43.234 --> 31:46.704
every extraterrestrial being
throughout the entire universe.

31:50.842 --> 31:53.912
Is it possible
that the Cosmic Egg isn't only

31:54.011 --> 31:58.081
a symbol for the universe,
or how the universe was formed,

31:58.182 --> 32:01.922
but represents a connection
that exists within

32:02.019 --> 32:04.589
each and every human to the cosmos?

32:04.689 --> 32:08.559
And possibly to extraterrestrial beings

32:08.659 --> 32:11.959
that came to Earth in the distant past?

32:12.063 --> 32:14.933
Ancient astronaut theorists
point out that,

32:15.032 --> 32:17.032
while the third eye has historically

32:17.135 --> 32:21.095
been considered a metaphor,
there is an egg-shaped structure

32:21.205 --> 32:24.135
within the brain
that is critical in defining

32:24.242 --> 32:28.942
what it means to be human: the thalamus.

32:30.181 --> 32:32.821
Shaped like two identical eggs,

32:32.917 --> 32:35.747
the thalamus lies
at the center of the brain

32:35.853 --> 32:39.193
and is the hub responsible
for relaying information

32:39.290 --> 32:42.220
from most of the sensory receptors.

32:42.326 --> 32:47.596
Scientists studying the effects
of thalamic stimulation

32:47.698 --> 32:49.828
on comatose patients have
recently suggested

32:49.934 --> 32:52.804
the thalamus might be
the most important factor

32:52.904 --> 32:55.744
in human consciousness.

32:57.341 --> 32:58.611
The thalamus is like

32:58.709 --> 33:00.309
a relay station in the brain,

33:00.411 --> 33:03.981
so you have all the primary
sensory information coming in,

33:04.081 --> 33:06.551
like information coming in your eyes

33:06.651 --> 33:08.551
through your retina
and through your ears

33:08.653 --> 33:10.053
and all these sensations.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.764
The first place they go,
after the primary sense organs,

33:13.858 --> 33:16.088
is they get funneled to the thalamus.

33:16.194 --> 33:18.794
And then the thalamus
sorts out this information

33:18.896 --> 33:21.956
and relays it to the various
parts in the cortex

33:22.066 --> 33:26.436
that process that
primary sensory information.

33:27.805 --> 33:29.335
If the thalamus is damaged,

33:29.440 --> 33:33.880
usually it will knock out consciousness.

33:33.978 --> 33:36.908
It's a very critical point where
all the information comes to,

33:37.014 --> 33:39.014
and then it's distributed in the cortex.

33:40.985 --> 33:44.085
The thalamus is called
the Lamp, the Open Eye,

33:44.188 --> 33:45.988
even the Third Eye.

33:46.090 --> 33:49.190
And when you look at this, you wonder:

33:49.293 --> 33:50.833
was it in fact a gift

33:50.928 --> 33:54.828
from extraterrestrial beings
that awakened us?

33:54.932 --> 33:58.072
That enabled us to become
connected to the diviner,

33:58.169 --> 34:00.769
extraterrestrial realm?

34:00.871 --> 34:03.541
Perhaps the extraterrestrials
that had a hand

34:03.641 --> 34:07.581
in fashioning the human body
and in tweaking the human brain,

34:07.678 --> 34:10.547
placed the thalamus there,
in its egg shape,

34:10.648 --> 34:13.978
as a connecting link
to the greater civilization,

34:14.085 --> 34:15.675
out of which we originally emerged.

34:18.789 --> 34:21.559
Could the thalamus
be the physical representation

34:21.659 --> 34:26.199
of what ancient cultures
referred to as the third eye?

34:26.297 --> 34:29.567
And if so, might this
brain structure act

34:29.667 --> 34:33.067
as a connection to greater
forces in the universe?

34:34.438 --> 34:36.938
As incredible as this notion may seem,

34:37.041 --> 34:40.741
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the thalamus

34:40.844 --> 34:42.945
can also be found represented

34:43.047 --> 34:47.047
in one of the most prominent
symbols of ancient Egypt--

34:47.150 --> 34:49.251
the Eye of Horus.

34:52.389 --> 34:55.690
The Eye of Horus,
also known as the Eye of Ra,

34:55.793 --> 35:00.803
was a symbol of protection,
royal power and good health.

35:00.898 --> 35:04.898
But it was also known
as the Eye of Providence,

35:05.002 --> 35:07.642
the all-seeing eye of God.

35:07.738 --> 35:11.668
Now what is incredible is
if you look at the thalamus,

35:11.776 --> 35:15.206
and all of the structures
surrounding that,

35:15.313 --> 35:17.953
it looks like the Eye of Horus.

35:18.049 --> 35:21.719
The similarity is really
pretty astonishing.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.549
According to scientists and historians,

35:24.655 --> 35:27.555
the Ancient Egyptians
were likely aware of

35:27.658 --> 35:30.088
the shape of these brain structures.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.264
Well, we have to remember that
the ancient people

35:32.363 --> 35:34.133
were pretty conversant with

35:34.231 --> 35:36.331
cutting animals open of all kinds.

35:36.434 --> 35:41.044
And humans were cleaved open,
broken open.

35:41.138 --> 35:42.968
There would've been any number of ways

35:43.074 --> 35:46.014
for early humans to start
looking at brain structure.

35:46.110 --> 35:49.110
It's clear that thinking
comes from the brain,

35:49.213 --> 35:51.713
but what was the part of
the thalamus for this?

35:51.816 --> 35:56.216
How would the ancient
Egyptians have known about

35:56.320 --> 35:59.620
how all of these parts
of the brain function together?

35:59.724 --> 36:02.224
Is it possible
that they got this knowledge

36:02.326 --> 36:04.086
from extraterrestrials?

36:07.932 --> 36:09.232
Could the Eye of Horus

36:09.333 --> 36:13.743
help solve the puzzle of the Cosmic Egg?

36:13.838 --> 36:16.168
And might the symbol of the Cosmic Egg,

36:16.273 --> 36:17.973
with intertwined serpents,

36:18.075 --> 36:21.535
represent both the thalamus and DNA,

36:21.645 --> 36:23.805
the two biological traits

36:23.914 --> 36:25.554
that are most important in defining

36:25.649 --> 36:28.619
what it means to be human?

36:28.719 --> 36:35.159
Scientists estimate that 98.8%
of our DNA goes unused.

36:35.259 --> 36:38.729
And so, it would seem that our creators,

36:38.829 --> 36:40.829
possibly extraterrestrials,

36:40.931 --> 36:46.171
have designed a tool to
help us ultimately unlock

36:46.270 --> 36:51.840
all the potential that we have
already in our DNA and bodies,

36:51.942 --> 36:55.712
and become greater than we are today.

36:57.681 --> 36:59.751
Is it possible that the simple design

36:59.850 --> 37:03.090
of the Cosmic Egg
is a message handed down

37:03.187 --> 37:05.747
from extraterrestrials to humanity,

37:05.856 --> 37:08.856
telling us not only where we come from,

37:08.959 --> 37:11.729
but where we are going?

37:11.829 --> 37:16.699
Or does it symbolize our
connection to the cosmos?

37:16.801 --> 37:19.031
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

37:19.136 --> 37:22.906
there may be an even more
profound explanation.

37:28.053 --> 37:29.923
In the tradition of the Kabbalah,

37:30.022 --> 37:32.922
the ancient Jewish
mystical philosophy that

37:33.025 --> 37:36.125
arose in the sixth century BC,

37:36.228 --> 37:38.328
an egg-shaped bubble of iridescence

37:38.430 --> 37:41.570
surrounds every human body.

37:41.667 --> 37:44.897
Indian texts dating back 5,000 years

37:45.004 --> 37:48.214
refer to this life energy as "pram."

37:48.307 --> 37:52.007
And Chinese writings
from roughly the same period

37:52.111 --> 37:55.681
contain a similar
concept known as "chi."

37:57.516 --> 38:00.776
Today, there are
some scientists who propose

38:00.886 --> 38:04.956
that there is, in fact,
such an energy that surrounds us

38:05.057 --> 38:08.957
and connects us to all
things in the universe,

38:09.061 --> 38:11.561
a notion that is represented in a theory

38:11.664 --> 38:14.134
called the Holographic Universe.

38:19.638 --> 38:23.068
This scientific discovery,
which is mathematically proven,

38:23.175 --> 38:28.075
tells us that we have an
illusion of a physical universe,

38:28.180 --> 38:30.050
when, in fact, it is all emanating

38:30.149 --> 38:35.889
from a geometric seed or an egg;
a singularity.

38:35.988 --> 38:39.188
All of space and all of time,

38:39.291 --> 38:43.891
and all of the universe itself
is simultaneously

38:43.996 --> 38:47.966
in a singular point,
or a seed, like an egg,

38:48.067 --> 38:53.037
and is telling us that,
in fact, there is a geometry,

38:53.138 --> 38:58.078
that it's possible that these
egg-shaped energy fields exist,

38:58.177 --> 39:01.037
and they are, in fact, the true essence

39:01.146 --> 39:04.616
of what it means
to be alive in this universe.

39:07.353 --> 39:10.293
Curiously, in 2006,

39:10.389 --> 39:13.289
Italian scientists, using data gathered

39:13.392 --> 39:16.962
by NASA'S Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe

39:17.062 --> 39:19.602
announced that the universe
might actually

39:19.698 --> 39:23.198
be in the shape of an egg.

39:23.302 --> 39:26.172
Seven years later, in 2013,

39:26.272 --> 39:28.272
NASA scientists announced

39:28.374 --> 39:30.974
that while it looks
circular to the naked eye,

39:31.076 --> 39:35.406
the Earth, too,
is in the shape of an egg.

39:35.514 --> 39:38.554
Is it possible that the ancient
symbol of the Cosmic Egg

39:38.651 --> 39:40.351
represents this notion

39:40.452 --> 39:43.422
that all things
in the universe are connected?

39:44.990 --> 39:47.260
When we ask, does the Cosmic Egg

39:47.359 --> 39:48.759
represent the Big Bang?

39:51.196 --> 39:53.526
Does it represent the human thalamus?

39:53.632 --> 39:55.202
Many of these ancient cultures

39:55.301 --> 39:58.041
were very consistent
in the use of symbolism

39:58.137 --> 40:00.137
as a multidimensional function,

40:00.239 --> 40:04.239
and all these different aspects
of the universe

40:04.343 --> 40:06.343
are ultimately emanations of

40:06.445 --> 40:10.245
this one central identity,
or the Cosmic Egg itself.

40:12.618 --> 40:14.218
In looking at the shape

40:14.320 --> 40:16.590
of the Cosmic Egg across
all various dimensions,

40:16.689 --> 40:20.159
whether it be at a macro level--
the shape of the universe;

40:20.259 --> 40:22.429
the micro level--
the shape of the thalamus;

40:22.528 --> 40:24.588
they all seem to be interconnected,

40:24.697 --> 40:26.597
explaining that this shape
seems to connect us

40:26.699 --> 40:29.229
with a higher state of existence,

40:29.335 --> 40:32.135
possibly even with
higher states of beings:

40:32.237 --> 40:34.237
what we might call extraterrestrials.

40:37.376 --> 40:38.536
Like the Christian Cross,

40:38.644 --> 40:40.044
like the Star of David,

40:40.145 --> 40:42.875
like the Hindu Mandala...

40:42.981 --> 40:46.121
the Cosmic Egg is
a symbol that connects.

40:46.218 --> 40:48.188
But it goes beyond just connecting.

40:48.287 --> 40:51.887
It seems to point to
our source of origin.

40:51.990 --> 40:54.620
And ultimately, as we embrace
the symbol of the Cosmic Egg,

40:54.727 --> 40:59.327
it causes us to recognize
the unity of all of creation

40:59.431 --> 41:01.831
and this fundamental, very simple idea

41:01.934 --> 41:04.944
that we all came from
the same original point, seed,

41:05.037 --> 41:08.167
or Cosmic Egg, that broke up, dispersed

41:08.273 --> 41:12.013
and will one day reunify.

41:14.413 --> 41:17.483
Might the Cosmic Egg
be an important clue

41:17.583 --> 41:22.193
for what connects us to other
entities in the universe--

41:22.287 --> 41:26.157
entities that may even be our creators?

41:26.258 --> 41:30.088
If so, is it their intention
that as we discover more

41:30.195 --> 41:32.455
about not just
the mysteries of the universe,

41:32.564 --> 41:36.134
but the mysteries within
each and every one of us,

41:36.235 --> 41:38.895
we will arrive at this conclusion?

41:39.004 --> 41:40.974
Perhaps one day soon,

41:41.073 --> 41:44.513
we will discover that within
the symbol of the Cosmic Egg

41:44.610 --> 41:47.580
lies the key to ascending beyond Earth,

41:47.679 --> 41:50.449
to join our alien ancestors

41:50.549 --> 41:52.449
in the stars.
