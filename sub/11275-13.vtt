                arrived here,   

05:54.563 --> 05:55.862
              I have been       
              desperately trying

05:55.897 --> 05:57.631
          to upgrade the        
          clientele in this bar.

05:57.666 --> 05:59.366

some other night.

our weekly pool tournament.     

06:02.937 --> 06:04.188

That's right.

of the '80s.

to meet a group of adults

to the great god, television.

Hey, Woody,                     

07:05.383 --> 07:07.468
        when you were on the    
        set there, you see      
        any famous actresses?

 What about all the drug stuff  
            you hear            

07:09.721 --> 07:11.155
    about in show business--    
        see any of that?

these stories.

                 uh, check ready
                 for me, Cliff? 

07:26.354 --> 07:29.657

    give you one now.

    you are going to pay me     
for this job, aren't you?       

07:44.556 --> 07:46.674
  Hey, Normie, look, you, uh,   
  didn't charge me last year    

07:46.708 --> 07:48.176
  when you painted Ma's house,  
            did you?            

07:48.210 --> 07:50.010
        Well, that was before   
        I was a professional.   

07:50.045 --> 07:52.946
 Oh, I'll say. We never did get 
     those windows unstuck.

            NORM:               
            Cliff, I finished   
            half your place.    

07:54.766 --> 07:57.401
        I'll be happy to        
        come by and finish      
        the rest of it, okay?   

07:57.435 --> 07:58.936
    I'd appreciate a check.     
    If you've got a problem

 a payment schedule right now?

    money is not a problem.     

08:03.157 --> 08:06.092
You know that. It's just,       
 uh, well, I'm not a cheap man. 

08:06.127 --> 08:07.812
Oh, a statement I'll wager      
     has never been uttered

going to charge me for all this,

08:13.301 --> 08:14.802
      I would've demanded       
         a better job.          

08:14.836 --> 08:16.837
         Now, I've been         
letting you slide, buddy.

          If you think          
the work is so worthless,       

08:18.673 --> 08:20.273
just finish it yourself, Cliff. 

08:20.308 --> 08:21.825
        Well, uh,               
      not that I couldn't.      

08:21.859 --> 08:24.161
I mean, it doesn't exactly take 
        a Phi Beta Kappa

 to stick a brush in a bucket,  
  slap it on a wall, does it?

of skill and precision it takes

I realized

that I needed somebody

20:31.071 --> 20:32.388
    How'd you become            
    a mailman anyway?           

20:32.423 --> 20:34.491
      What, did you flunk       
    out of tollbooth school?    

20:34.525 --> 20:35.775
            ( <i>laughing</i> )        

20:35.809 --> 20:37.577
Hey, all right, now,            
that's a good one.              

20:37.611 --> 20:38.678
    Yep.                        

20:38.712 --> 20:40.246
Know why, uh, dogs hate mailmen?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.182
      They just want to be      
      like everyone else.       

20:42.216 --> 20:43.617
        ( <i>laughing heartily</i> )   

20:43.651 --> 20:46.386
     All right, that's it.      
         It's go time.          

20:46.420 --> 20:48.705
 Okay, fellas, this is the guy  
 I've been telling you about.   

20:48.739 --> 20:50.206
    Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!           
    Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!     

20:50.240 --> 20:52.575
 No, come on! Come on! Come on! 
Cli... Look at yourselves, here.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.944
         Cliff! Cliff,          
this is your friend, Norm.      

20:54.978 --> 20:57.179
Norm, this is your buddy, Cliff.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.066
                  You don't want
                  to do this.   

20:59.100 --> 21:00.333
                    Now, do you?

21:00.367 --> 21:01.501
     All right, all right!      
        Hey, whoa!              

21:01.535 --> 21:03.035
     Somebody help me here,     
         man, will you?         

21:03.070 --> 21:04.237
 Hey, stop! Hey, stop it, now.  

21:04.271 --> 21:05.472
Listen, I...                    

21:05.506 --> 21:07.173
              You guys have been
              friends for years.

21:07.208 --> 21:08.975
Think of all the things         
you've done together.           

21:09.010 --> 21:11.144
         You, you...            
         Drinking beer together.

21:11.178 --> 21:14.180
And I'm sure there's            
a lot of other stuff, too.      

21:14.214 --> 21:15.381
                  Hey, you know,

21:15.416 --> 21:17.000
you're partly at fault here.    

21:17.034 --> 21:18.184
              You made fun      
              of his profession,

21:18.219 --> 21:19.386
                 and you refused
                 to pay him.    

21:19.420 --> 21:20.487
                And you, Norm...

21:20.521 --> 21:22.389
Actually, you didn't            
do anything at                  
all, did you?                   

21:22.423 --> 21:23.556
I'll tell you what.             

21:23.590 --> 21:26.692
 Why don't you let me hold him, 
     and you biff him one?      

21:26.727 --> 21:28.661
I don't know, Sammy.            

21:28.695 --> 21:30.797
        I just want this        
        to be over with.        

21:30.831 --> 21:32.365
            Yeah, me, too.      

21:33.184 --> 21:34.534
        ( <i>sighs</i> )               
     Well, I'm sorry, Norm.     

21:34.568 --> 21:37.003
    Just... make out a bill,    
        and I'll pay it.        

21:37.037 --> 21:38.204
  I'll give you that discount.  

21:38.239 --> 21:40.006
      All right, uh, I...       

21:40.041 --> 21:42.742
 I guess that monkey stuff was  
 a little bit out of line, huh? 

21:42.776 --> 21:44.694
     It was actually pretty     
funny, but... ( <i>chuckles</i> )      

21:44.729 --> 21:47.581
It's a small man who can't laugh
at his own profession, you know?

21:47.615 --> 21:50.683
                  Yeah.         
I just want to let bygones      
be bygones, all right?          

21:50.718 --> 21:53.220
And the important               
thing is we're just...          
still friends, hmm?             

21:54.388 --> 21:55.422
                 You mind, guys?

21:55.456 --> 21:56.756
Oh, oh, no, sorry, sorry.       

21:56.790 --> 21:57.957
    Hey, hey, come on.

         ( <i>both grunt</i> )         

22:03.230 --> 22:04.797
Yeah, Normie, I'm, uh,          

22:04.832 --> 22:08.602
I'm sort of sorry about         
everything that happened.       

22:08.636 --> 22:10.337
                Oh, well, Cliff,
                I'm even sorrier

22:10.371 --> 22:11.771
                for what's      
                about to happen.

22:11.805 --> 22:13.039
Huh? What do you mean?          

22:31.291 --> 22:32.625
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

22:37.999 --> 22:40.350
You're dead meat, Peterson!     

22:44.555 --> 22:46.039
                  Let's go shoot
                  some stick.   

22:50.912 --> 22:52.078
          Hey, Woody.           

22:52.112 --> 22:54.748
  Hey, Bob, how are you doing?  

22:54.782 --> 22:56.049
Fine. Look, I was               
just passing by,                

22:56.083 --> 22:57.383
and I wanted                    
to return your gloves.          

22:57.418 --> 22:59.152
Thanks for letting              
me use them.                    
              Hey, my pleasure. 

22:59.186 --> 23:00.620
            Listen, could you   
            hang on a second?   
Sure.                           

23:00.655 --> 23:01.988
             I got some friends 
             you'd love to meet.

23:02.022 --> 23:03.657
             Yeah.              

23:05.426 --> 23:07.561
        Miss Howe?              

23:07.595 --> 23:08.778
            You'll never        
            guess who's here.   

23:08.812 --> 23:09.846
                      Bob Urich.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.347
            Woody, it's been    
            a horrible night.   

23:11.381 --> 23:13.266
          I'm really not in     
          the mood to be teased.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.034
    No, no, it's the truth.     
    He's really here.           

23:15.068 --> 23:17.036
                 Woody, go away!

23:18.872 --> 23:20.674
She's a big fan of yours.

                 MAN:           
                 Oh, sure, Wood.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.581
                  Who's he with,
                  Liz Taylor?   

23:29.850 --> 23:31.051
      You're not, are you?      

23:31.085 --> 23:32.702
              No.

     we were shooting late,     

23:34.371 --> 23:35.638
         and I'm having         
    a few people over.          

23:35.673 --> 23:36.839
      You want to come by?      

23:36.874 --> 23:37.674
            You bet.            

23:37.708 --> 23:40.227
Yeah, come on.                  
            Great.

right outside.

  Could you hang on a second?   
     I want to check here.

Sure.

    over to his house.
