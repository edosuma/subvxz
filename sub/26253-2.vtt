WEBVTT

00:02.830 --> 00:04.960
Do you see anything, Iron Man?

00:06.710 --> 00:08.499
I see you've got a
nice roof pool.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.038
But your embassy's not
very scan-friendly.

00:11.039 --> 00:15.829
We do not need to see inside to know my
sister is there, alone, with Tiger Shark.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.078
Guys, me and Black Panther are
headed into what could be

00:21.079 --> 00:24.499
an all-hands-on-deck thing with Tiger
Shark at the Wakandan Embassy.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.328
What's your status?

00:32.296 --> 00:33.419
Close to Embassy Row.

00:35.173 --> 00:37.459
Atlanteans everywhere.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.249
No. We got this.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.119
You got rid of Tiger
Shark's sea monsters,

00:52.122 --> 00:54.328
But lots of his troops
are still active.

00:54.329 --> 00:57.210
We'll be with you when we're
done mopping up stragglers.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.619
Shuri does not have time
to wait for rescue.

01:07.253 --> 01:09.620
T'Challa, wait! Why do I bother?

01:12.539 --> 01:15.500
You do your thing. I'll deal
with the gate crashers.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.710
Aahh!

01:19.329 --> 01:21.578
Shuri, it is T'Challa.

01:21.579 --> 01:23.749
Are you all right, sister?

01:25.379 --> 01:29.078
That depends entirely on your
definition of "all right."

01:37.210 --> 01:40.288
Thank you for the
exercise, Princess.

01:40.289 --> 01:42.460
I've worked up
quite an appetite.

Aah!

Aah!

02:06.620 --> 02:08.249
Shuri, keep away!

02:08.250 --> 02:10.418
Tiger Shark is too dangerous.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.209
<i>Don't worry about me, T'Challa.</i>

02:12.210 --> 02:13.460
<i>I can lose him.</i>

02:15.789 --> 02:17.828
You're wasting time, Princess!

02:20.711 --> 02:22.493
We both know how this ends!

02:36.079 --> 02:38.378
Princess.

02:38.379 --> 02:41.078
Little Princess!

02:41.079 --> 02:43.210
I will find you.

02:45.329 --> 02:47.378
<i>Why are you still
in the building?</i>

02:47.379 --> 02:50.288
I was thinking. I'll just
pop down to the armory,

02:50.289 --> 02:51.669
and then I can take this...

02:51.670 --> 02:53.999
What did you call him?
Tiger Shark.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.645
<i>I'll take him myself.</i>

02:55.646 --> 02:57.288
Do not engage him.

02:57.289 --> 03:00.249
- I have a plan.
- <i>So do I. I just told you.</i>

03:00.250 --> 03:01.645
<i>Get out of the armory, and...</i>

03:01.646 --> 03:03.038
Do as I say, Sister.

03:03.039 --> 03:04.619
This is not a negotiation.

03:04.620 --> 03:06.829
- <i>Please.</i>
- Fine.

03:06.830 --> 03:09.749
I'm going. You never
let me have any fun.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.079
Actually... No. Wait.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.330
There is something you can do.

03:22.079 --> 03:24.669
There you are!

03:31.460 --> 03:35.038
Oh, no! No, no, no!

03:35.039 --> 03:38.459
I seem to have trapped myself.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.038
All alone now, Princess.

03:41.039 --> 03:44.419
No more running, no more hiding.

03:44.420 --> 03:48.119
It's just you and me...

03:48.120 --> 03:50.038
and my claws!

03:50.039 --> 03:52.459
Stay back! Stay...

03:52.460 --> 03:54.459
Actually, stay right there.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.829
What?

04:03.039 --> 04:04.378
Shuri, now!

04:13.250 --> 04:15.329
And this was your plan?

04:15.330 --> 04:17.789
To give the dangerous
intruder a timeout?

04:17.790 --> 04:20.119
I am giving you
time to get away.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.378
Now. I will deal
with Tiger Shark.

04:23.379 --> 04:25.169
Oh, I'm not leaving.

04:25.170 --> 04:26.708
Not when things are
getting interesting.

04:26.709 --> 04:29.789
Shuri, please. Right
now is not the time.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.828
I'm trying to keep you safe.

04:31.829 --> 04:33.499
I am the princess.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.039
I have the same duty to
protect this embassy as you.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.828
I am the king, and I am
commanding you to...

04:38.829 --> 04:41.039
Father would let me stay.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.039
Father would let me help you.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.619
Blast it, Shuri, you will...

04:46.620 --> 04:49.290
You are right.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.708
Father would let you stay.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.458
Right. I'll just get a sword,
shall I, and we can...

04:56.459 --> 05:00.378
No. You will help me by
rebooting the security system.

05:00.379 --> 05:03.619
The security system?
T'Challa, that's so dull!

05:03.620 --> 05:06.789
The perimeter is down, and there
are Atlanteans on our lawn.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.419
Your Avenger friends can
handle that, can't they?

05:09.420 --> 05:10.958
I saw Iron Man out there.

05:10.959 --> 05:14.249
Guys, remember when I
said "all hands on deck"?

05:14.250 --> 05:17.078
Aah!

05:17.079 --> 05:19.828
I might actually need
a few more hands.

05:19.829 --> 05:22.249
Guys? Fantastic.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.208
It is our lawn, Shuri.

05:24.209 --> 05:26.458
And you designed the system.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.458
What would Father say?

05:28.459 --> 05:31.578
Not fair saying my
thing back at me.

05:31.579 --> 05:35.039
Fine.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.578
I hate you.

05:36.579 --> 05:40.499
You don't mean that.
She doesn't mean that.

05:43.670 --> 05:45.789
I wish you were here, Father.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.419
I know I promised you I would
shield her from danger,

05:48.420 --> 05:49.795
but she makes it so...

05:54.209 --> 05:57.999
Humans! Wakandans!
Always in the way.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.499
Always thwarting your betters.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.540
I have not had the pleasure
of meeting anyone better.

06:15.379 --> 06:17.578
Why are you in my
house, Tiger Shark?

06:17.579 --> 06:19.458
You think I'll tell you?

06:19.459 --> 06:22.040
You think I'm a fool?

06:28.500 --> 06:31.539
This embassy is a
piece of Wakanda.

06:31.540 --> 06:33.539
Don't you know what
we do to trespassers?

06:33.540 --> 06:35.458
Wakanda is finished!

06:36.670 --> 06:39.119
Your surface world is finished!

06:40.540 --> 06:43.828
That primitive toy
won't save you.

06:51.540 --> 06:54.078
Toy? Perhaps.

06:54.079 --> 06:57.669
Primitive? As Iron
Man might say,

06:57.670 --> 07:00.619
Wakanda does not do primitive.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.419
Aah! No.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.708
No. No!

07:13.709 --> 07:16.328
Hey, no stabbing Tony!

07:17.379 --> 07:19.619
In fact, no stabbing anybody.

07:22.170 --> 07:24.578
You guys are the worst
party guests I...

07:24.579 --> 07:25.920
Hey!

07:27.040 --> 07:29.119
What did I just say
about stabbing?

07:42.120 --> 07:44.169
You started a war with
the surface world.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.539
You brought a monster
to this city.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.749
Why did you leave the battle to come here?
To break into my house?

07:55.329 --> 07:58.378
Answer my questions. There
is no escape from here.

07:58.379 --> 08:01.619
Escape?

08:01.620 --> 08:03.829
"Escape," did you say?

08:31.290 --> 08:34.580
The cat is yours, my elites.
I will complete the mission.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.829
<i>T'Challa, do you need help?</i>

09:03.830 --> 09:05.455
No.

09:05.456 --> 09:07.080
<i>Are you sure?</i>

09:08.080 --> 09:10.250
Yes, I am fine.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.119
Because it looks
like you need help.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.668
<i>I do not need assistance.</i>

09:16.669 --> 09:18.079
I'm coming down.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.749
No. Stay there.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.619
Finish your work.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.119
I have this under control.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.959
Now we break you.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.119
You've broken
enough stuff today.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.620
Take them! Hurry!
We can still...

09:41.830 --> 09:43.829
Sorry about the flag, T'Challa.

09:43.830 --> 09:47.169
Do not worry, Captain. I
shall have it mended.

09:53.289 --> 09:54.788
We said we'd be here.

09:54.789 --> 09:57.209
You couldn't wait a few
minutes to start the party?

09:57.210 --> 09:58.709
This is Tiger Shark's party.

09:58.710 --> 10:01.079
He is here, searching
for something.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.600
We must find him.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.119
<i>Give me a moment.</i>

10:04.120 --> 10:07.499
The cameras are back. I may be able
to narrow down your search a bit.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.168
He doesn't seem to be on any
of the embassy's upper floors.

10:11.169 --> 10:14.459
<i>The sublevels, then. It is
the only logical place.</i>

10:14.460 --> 10:16.749
That makes sense.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.378
The secure vaults
are down there.

10:18.379 --> 10:21.379
As is the embassy's
cache of Vibranium.

10:24.289 --> 10:25.878
Well. This is...

10:25.879 --> 10:28.038
Wow.

10:28.039 --> 10:29.829
What is this?

10:29.830 --> 10:32.829
This is the information hub.
We thought it best

10:32.830 --> 10:35.249
to place a small
technical facility here.

10:35.250 --> 10:38.878
"Small"? Tony's brain would
melt if he saw all this.

10:38.879 --> 10:40.668
Tiger Shark is not here.

10:40.669 --> 10:42.668
How many levels are there?

10:42.669 --> 10:44.169
Three more below us.

10:44.170 --> 10:45.669
That's one each. Let's move out.

10:49.879 --> 10:52.379
I'm on the testing floor.
It's clear.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.709
The hangar's clear.
No Tiger Shark.

10:58.710 --> 11:00.919
And, yes, there's a hangar.

11:04.379 --> 11:08.168
The Gyroforge is intact.
No Vibranium is missing.

11:08.169 --> 11:11.749
Tiger Shark is not here.
This makes no sense.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.829
Why would he go to all
this trouble and not steal

11:13.830 --> 11:15.959
the most valuable
metal on Earth?

11:15.960 --> 11:18.499
<i>Maybe he's an art lover.</i>

11:18.500 --> 11:22.168
I say that because right now,
he's in the cultural art gallery,

11:22.169 --> 11:23.959
looking at vases?

11:23.960 --> 11:26.288
<i>Vases? Why would he want vases?</i>

11:26.289 --> 11:28.329
Good question.
Especially because

11:28.330 --> 11:31.959
those particular vases are quite
old but basically worthless.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.959
<i>That is odd, I agree.</i>

11:33.960 --> 11:35.959
So, I'll just pop in there,
shock him unconscious,

11:35.960 --> 11:37.190
and we can call it a day, yes?

11:37.191 --> 11:38.418
<i>No.</i>

11:40.066 --> 11:41.709
<i>Stay where you are. Don't argue.</i>

11:41.710 --> 11:44.959
<i>Be safe. Safe, Shuri.
I need your eyes.</i>

11:44.960 --> 11:47.830
<i>Tiger Shark may have
more surprises.</i>

11:50.830 --> 11:54.079
No. No! No!

11:54.080 --> 11:56.079
Ah! At last.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.918
Once I deliver this, the world
will never be the same again.

11:59.919 --> 12:03.959
Some folks just have no respect
for other people's things.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.709
What? No!

12:24.530 --> 12:27.239
That's just great.

12:30.079 --> 12:33.078
Round two, Tiger Shark.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.949
No! No, you won't stop me!

12:44.739 --> 12:47.279
It is time to surrender
now, Tiger Shark.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.659
You are surrounded.
You cannot escape.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.619
Fools! You're nothing to me!
Nothing!

13:14.619 --> 13:18.699
You can't stop me. You
can't see what's coming.

13:18.700 --> 13:22.989
You'll be too busy saving
your own pitiful lives!

13:38.450 --> 13:42.699
Not this time. This
time you lose.

13:53.619 --> 13:57.199
Warriors, the prize is mine!
Withdraw!

13:57.200 --> 14:00.530
Okay, officially the
worst invasion ever.

14:11.280 --> 14:15.319
No, no. Guys, it's Tony.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.368
Please respond. Come on, guys.

14:18.369 --> 14:19.659
Anybody?

14:19.660 --> 14:21.720
One little peep?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.078
All right, people, push!

14:29.320 --> 14:31.529
Hey! Not gonna say
you had me worried

14:31.530 --> 14:33.320
- for a second, but you really...
- Shuri!

14:33.323 --> 14:35.659
Where is my sister? Shuri!

14:35.660 --> 14:38.699
<i>For a panther, you do make
an awful lot of noise.</i>

14:38.700 --> 14:41.699
<i>Shuri, are you all right?</i>

14:41.700 --> 14:44.199
<i>Shuri, speak to me, sister!</i>

14:44.200 --> 14:46.199
I'm fine, T'Challa.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.279
<i>You're not hurt? Where are you?</i>

14:48.280 --> 14:50.868
Just a bit crunched because an
entire building fell on me,

14:50.869 --> 14:53.078
but, otherwise, quite well.

14:53.079 --> 14:55.819
Do not worry. I am
coming for you.

14:55.820 --> 14:58.618
T'Challa, we'll
take care of Shuri.

14:58.619 --> 15:00.659
Someone needs to
stop Tiger Shark.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.909
You're the best tracker.

15:02.910 --> 15:06.578
<i>I'm all right, brother. Go.</i>

15:06.579 --> 15:08.055
Iron Man!

15:08.056 --> 15:09.530
Right with ya, buddy!

15:18.950 --> 15:22.779
I have the prize, but the
Avengers are on my trail.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.819
I need pickup now!

15:24.820 --> 15:26.868
<i>There will be no rescue.</i>

15:26.869 --> 15:29.819
<i>Your actions have already drawn
too much attention to us.</i>

15:29.820 --> 15:33.078
I did what was necessary
to secure the prize!

15:33.079 --> 15:37.449
<i>Yes. Enjoy your success, alone.</i>

15:37.450 --> 15:39.779
<i>Good-bye, Tiger Shark.</i>

15:39.780 --> 15:42.279
No! You must get me out of here!

15:42.280 --> 15:45.488
Are you listening? You must...

15:49.869 --> 15:52.488
That is mine!

15:52.489 --> 15:55.368
A clay vase from
ancient Wakanda?

15:55.369 --> 15:59.368
You attacked this city, endangered
countless lives, for this?

15:59.369 --> 16:01.029
Why?

16:01.030 --> 16:03.078
You will know soon enough.

16:03.079 --> 16:05.619
The whole world will know!

16:08.410 --> 16:11.529
Don't be stupid. There's no
way you're getting out of...

16:11.530 --> 16:14.238
Why do they always
choose stupid?

16:16.110 --> 16:18.938
That's far enough, Mr. Sharkey.

16:18.939 --> 16:20.519
Hands up, face down.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.085
Stay right there.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.438
I'll be right...

16:25.439 --> 16:28.019
Really starting
to hate this guy.

16:32.279 --> 16:34.068
Need a lift?

16:34.069 --> 16:36.569
I find that I do.

16:45.860 --> 16:49.230
Almost there. Almost.

16:51.439 --> 16:53.609
You are too late, Avenger!

16:53.610 --> 16:57.609
In moments, I will reach
the water, and...

16:57.610 --> 16:58.860
Huh?

17:03.860 --> 17:06.689
I can still win!

17:25.229 --> 17:26.819
What in the world?

17:30.650 --> 17:33.438
It bears my family crest!
The royal seal!

17:39.900 --> 17:41.610
Tiger Shark!

17:45.070 --> 17:48.960
Almost to the water. So close!

17:53.110 --> 17:55.279
Halt!

18:02.189 --> 18:03.189
Ah?

18:28.519 --> 18:31.518
You have lost, Tiger Shark.
Your army is beaten.

18:31.519 --> 18:34.150
You are dehydrated.
Your running is done.

18:34.153 --> 18:36.319
You went to a lot of
trouble to get this.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.399
It bears Wakanda's royal seal.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.690
Tell me what it is!

18:41.979 --> 18:43.779
Tell me!

18:43.780 --> 18:48.279
King T'Challa, you
may stand down.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.729
Attuma. Of course.

18:53.729 --> 18:55.478
Lord Attuma.

18:55.479 --> 18:58.228
I am the ruler of Atlantis.

18:58.229 --> 18:59.859
Show respect.

18:59.860 --> 19:01.819
You are not taking him.

19:01.820 --> 19:03.938
Is this what you want?

19:03.939 --> 19:07.228
To go to war over this...
creature?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.569
A war begun by you.

19:09.570 --> 19:11.859
You started all this with
your attack on this city.

19:11.860 --> 19:16.109
Had I attacked this
city, it would be mine.

19:16.110 --> 19:20.400
In any case, Tiger Shark's
actions were not at my command.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.688
You're a fool, Attuma!
A blind, weak...

19:26.689 --> 19:29.069
Silence, traitor.

19:30.780 --> 19:32.188
"Traitor"?

19:32.189 --> 19:34.649
Uh, what exactly's
going on here?

19:34.650 --> 19:38.228
Tiger Shark is a
traitor to Atlantis.

19:38.229 --> 19:42.149
He attempted to start a war and
stole the Horn of Neptune.

19:42.150 --> 19:44.609
And you think you
can just take him?

19:44.610 --> 19:47.069
No! He has to face justice!

19:47.070 --> 19:50.819
So he will. In Atlantis.

19:50.820 --> 19:53.228
He is mine.

19:53.229 --> 19:58.228
For what he did to this city,
for what he did to my family!

19:58.229 --> 20:02.279
Atlantis has not broken
the peace, King T'Challa.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.399
Not yet.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.859
Will Wakanda do so over
this worthless minnow?

20:08.860 --> 20:12.438
What would your father
do now, I wonder?

20:12.439 --> 20:16.399
You dare mention my father.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.779
We won't get answers this way.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.319
Remove your hand, Captain.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.359
I do not need you to tell
me how to be a king.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.069
Okay, buddy. It's your play.

20:27.070 --> 20:29.069
The Avengers will
back your move.

20:29.070 --> 20:31.780
<i>What's it gonna be?</i>

20:38.189 --> 20:40.018
You may have him.

20:40.019 --> 20:41.150
Huh?

20:45.019 --> 20:47.728
Remember what happened
here today, Attuma.

20:47.729 --> 20:49.819
Atlantis never forgets.

20:49.820 --> 20:52.609
I trust Wakanda
will do likewise.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.400
Shuri, with me.

21:05.479 --> 21:07.938
You played your
exit well, brother.

21:07.939 --> 21:10.569
Quite dramatic. You almost
reminded me of Father.

21:10.570 --> 21:14.149
Father would not have
let it come to this.

21:14.150 --> 21:16.279
It isn't over, is it?

21:16.280 --> 21:17.819
No, it is not.

21:17.820 --> 21:19.819
Attuma's taking Tiger
Shark to Atlantis,

21:19.820 --> 21:21.688
and we're going after
him, aren't we?

21:21.689 --> 21:25.069
Indeed, Shuri. Indeed.

21:25.070 --> 21:27.637
That's one thing about
being your sister.

21:28.138 --> 21:30.264
It is never boring.
