13:37.067 --> 13:38.235
You've gone mad, Captain.

13:38.319 --> 13:39.528
That's enough out of me.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.072
Now, come on,
I got to find that whale.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.285
I found him!

13:48.120 --> 13:49.496
(SCREAMING)

13:50.873 --> 13:54.251
With my Oxo Good Grips
Cheese Knife, I stab at thee.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.507
You do know
I'm stabbing at thee, right?

14:02.968 --> 14:03.969
Ahhh!

14:13.020 --> 14:14.980
(PULSING SOUNDS)

14:22.863 --> 14:23.864
Oh!

14:30.371 --> 14:31.372
Ahhh!

14:32.539 --> 14:33.540
Hello.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.045
Think, Zoidberg.
You must remember something.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.213
No, nothing.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.131
For all I know, ourffiends
could have been eaten

14:41.215 --> 14:43.258
by some kind of
crazy space whale.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.386
Damn that
Bermuda Tetrahedron.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.431
It's taken my latest crew
just as it took my first one.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.643
Not to mention those single socks
from the dryer, am I right?

14:52.851 --> 14:54.228
Shut up, Zoidberg.

14:54.311 --> 14:58.232
Zoidberg, the grieving relatives
will be gathered here tomorrow

14:58.315 --> 14:59.483
in need of comfort.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.568
And with
no stone monument,

15:01.652 --> 15:04.905
they may well demand that I
refund their admission fees.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.241
(BOTH SOBBING)

15:11.203 --> 15:12.329
Where are we?

15:12.413 --> 15:13.997
In the belly
of the beast.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.625
Like that Bible guy who got
swallowed by the whale,

15:16.708 --> 15:17.709
Pinocchio.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.254
This is all
Obsessy Bessy's fault.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.588
Right on, sister.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.841
We should be back at
Planet Express right now,

15:23.924 --> 15:25.634
hiding from work
in the ceiling.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.219
Butno!

15:27.428 --> 15:29.721
For the last time,
I'm not obsessed.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.267
I just want this whale
to die, die, die!

15:33.517 --> 15:34.518
(RUMBLING)

15:36.562 --> 15:38.272
What's that loud
digesting sound?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.279
FRY: Holy crap!
Four-dimensional bowels!

15:45.446 --> 15:46.780
Einstein was right.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.125
Why? Why?

15:58.292 --> 16:00.419
Also what and how?

16:00.502 --> 16:03.422
<i>MAN". The great fish has chosen
you for a higher purpose.</i>

16:03.547 --> 16:06.717
It's a great mammal.
See? It's got whiskers.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.635
And I saw it
lactating earlier.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.220
Wait, who said that?

16:10.804 --> 16:11.805
(GASPS)

16:12.306 --> 16:16.226
I was once Lando Tucker, captain
of the first <i>Planet</i> Express ship.

16:16.477 --> 16:17.519
Ew!

16:17.603 --> 16:21.023
I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the
current <i>Planet</i> Express ship.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.399
What's going on?

16:22.649 --> 16:23.650
It's very simple.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.861
Well, actually
it's very complicated.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.863
Luckily,
I'm here to explain it.

16:28.155 --> 16:32.034
You see, this space whale
feeds on obsession.

16:32.326 --> 16:35.287
VVow. Are you gross looking.
Go on.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.039
The great space serpent...
Mammal.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.207
...figured out long ago

16:38.290 --> 16:40.667
that no one's more obsessed
than space captains.

16:42.753 --> 16:43.754
Oh!Ah!

16:43.962 --> 16:46.048
What are these things?
Get away!

16:46.256 --> 16:48.050
The whale's
nearly sucked me dry.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.636
HWlneed a new source of
obsession onoe I'm gone.

16:50.802 --> 16:55.349
How many times do I have to tell
other people? I'm not obsessed.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.476
The whale
is obsession, Leela.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.228
And you are the whale!

16:59.353 --> 17:01.021
I am not the whale!

17:01.230 --> 17:03.941
All I wanted was to
complete my delivery.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.444
Is that too much to ask?
One chicken pic:kin' delivery?

17:07.653 --> 17:09.112
This whale's gonna pay.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.199
It can't escape
what it already is, me!

17:12.366 --> 17:14.367
I am the whale!

17:16.369 --> 17:17.371
See?

17:18.247 --> 17:19.248
Ahhh!

17:21.250 --> 17:22.251
(WHALE SINGING)

17:31.718 --> 17:37.724
Fifty years, Junior. Fifty
years of crippling sorrow.

17:37.975 --> 17:41.103
Popsicles here. Can't mourn
the dead without a Popsicle.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.438
You think a Popsicle gonna
bring my daughter back?

17:43.564 --> 17:44.565
No, sir.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.317
You just talked
yourself out of a sale.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.279
Poor Amy.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.490
My days of joy
and luck are over.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.576
Guess I got to
quit that club.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.744
I can't believe
our Leela's gone.

17:57.828 --> 18:01.832
You always think you're going to
disappear in space before your children.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.584
Welcome, everyone.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.045
What a pleasure to see
so many miserable faces.

18:07.671 --> 18:08.672
(EXCLAIMING)

18:08.755 --> 18:09.798
Lemony!

18:09.965 --> 18:14.344
I had intended to unveil a
beautiful stone memorial today.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.305
But due to
the recent tragedy,

18:16.388 --> 18:19.808
I humbly ask you to join
me in a simple prayer.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.768
ALL: BOO!

18:22.352 --> 18:24.688
No refunds!
Shut up and bow your heads!

18:25.439 --> 18:27.232
O, mighty Isis...

18:28.108 --> 18:30.527
Oh, no.
My deal is doing the thing.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.404
(LIGHTNING CRACKING)

18:35.115 --> 18:38.910
Good Lord, it's some kind of
inter-dimensional space whale.

18:39.036 --> 18:41.288
I just remembered,
that's the guy.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.791
Now with the horror hair.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.464

19:05.354 --> 19:06.355

19:06.605 --> 19:09.983
Popsicles. Fill your gaping
mouth with a Popsicle.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.154
Leela, you're alive.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.032
Is that how you and your
friends are dressing now?

19:17.282 --> 19:18.325
Hello, everyone.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.744
I suppose you're wondering
why my flesh has melded

19:20.827 --> 19:22.663
with that of
a giant space whale.

19:22.913 --> 19:25.165
I'll admit to
a polite interest.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.919
At first I was consumed by a dark
obsession to kill the whale.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.962
Then I was consumed
by the whale.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.882
That sounds clever,
but it doesn't explain much.

19:33.965 --> 19:34.925
Shut up, Zoidberg.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.009
Okay.

19:36.093 --> 19:39.846
You see, beneath my obsession
lay an even deeper obsession.

19:40.013 --> 19:44.226
An obsession so strong, it allowed
me to overpower the beast's will

19:44.309 --> 19:46.436
and pilot it
through space and time.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.357
An obsession with
completing my delivery.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.238
Get your...

19:56.697 --> 19:57.698
ALL: Yay!

19:59.032 --> 20:02.619
PoorLando. This is just how
I want to remember him.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.330
Too bad,
'cause he's still alive.

20:07.708 --> 20:08.709
<i>Lands?</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:09.876
Told you I'd be back.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.503
You've grown, Junior.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.004
I'm 61.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.048
I don't know him.
What else you got?

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

20:27.644 --> 20:29.354
They haven't aged a day.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.399
The whale must have
some kind of MÃ©bius colon

20:32.482 --> 20:35.068
that endlessly
recycles time and space.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.529
Yep. That stands up to scrutiny.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.699
I should have
listened to my crew.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.534
That space whale
wasn't a monster.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.995
It was the obsession of
me and others like me

20:45.078 --> 20:46.788
that made it
into a monster.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.331
Mainly you.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.877
On the other hand,
the stupid fish did eat us.

Yeah.

pick up where we left off?
