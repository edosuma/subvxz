["Just for Us" playing]

00:32.440 --> 00:34.021
Someone wanna take you home

00:36.870 --> 00:37.814
Don't let 'em

00:39.660 --> 00:41.616
[Tony] I've always been rough
around the edges.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.826
Or at least that's what people think.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.366
Maybe it's what I want them to think.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.371
I hate you for making me do this.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.918
No, you don't. Admit it, you love it,
and you love me for it.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.718
[Tony] But Hannah,
she saw right through all that.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.633
Okay, what's going on?
You've been kinda bitchy all day.

00:57.890 --> 01:00.632
Excuse me?
I don't have a bitchy bone in my body.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.134
[chuckles]

01:04.520 --> 01:08.092
Okay, fine. There's a guy... at school.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.010
I love this story already. Who is he?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.645
He's... artsy.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.191
-Artsy.
-And dramatic.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.100
All code words for "too gay"?

01:17.200 --> 01:20.112
No, no, it's not that.
He's just totally not my type.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.690
Does this dramatic artist have a name?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.286
-Ryan Shaver.
-The guy with the 'zine?

01:26.370 --> 01:28.247
-Mm-hmm.
-[laughs]

01:28.330 --> 01:30.707
Holy shit.
Yeah, he's totally not your type.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.667
-Is he into you?
-Oh, yeah. No question.

01:32.750 --> 01:33.956
If you do say so yourself.

01:34.050 --> 01:38.589
Look, he's always smiling at me,
he laughs at jokes that are not jokes.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.710
And he, like, touches me
on the arm and shit.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.098
And what's the stimulus response
when he touches you on the arm?

01:44.180 --> 01:46.671
Part of me wants to say,
"Watch the leather, homo."

01:47.640 --> 01:50.108
Other part of me wants to throw him
against the locker and kiss him.

01:51.730 --> 01:52.560
[laughing]

01:52.650 --> 01:55.187
Oh, dear Lord. You are in trouble.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.060
-Yeah.
-You have to ask him out.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.481
-Ah, no.
-Come on.

01:58.780 --> 02:01.066
You need to restore my faith
in teenage male-kind.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.863
-Well, not all of us are Justin Foley.
-Prove it.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.208
[Tony] She was the kind of friend
who challenged me,

02:10.290 --> 02:11.575
whether I liked it or not.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.201
Hannah and I had a relationship like...

02:15.630 --> 02:17.461
well, we kept each other's secrets.

02:20.050 --> 02:21.540
So, what do you know

02:21.970 --> 02:24.461
that someone _
doesn't want you saying In court?

02:26.470 --> 02:27.346
I know a lot.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.469
I've done a lot.

02:32.020 --> 02:33.180
But you can't tell the cops?

02:34.610 --> 02:36.931
-Or your folks?
-Nope.

02:37.570 --> 02:41.939
-So, how bad is it gonna be?
-The school called me in, not the Bakers.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.826
The school wants me to talk

02:43.910 --> 02:47.823
about how Hannah blamed lots of people
and wanted revenge.

02:47.910 --> 02:51.289
-They told you that?
-No. The Bakers' lawyer did.

02:52.670 --> 02:55.878
He also warned me he would
have to make me look unreliable.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.669
-Oh, shit.
-I could fuck everything up.

03:01.260 --> 03:05.924
-For the Bakers?
-Yeah, for the Bakers, for my family.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.339
For us.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.687
Oh, so... we're an "us" now?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.139
I mean, yeah, like...

03:22.610 --> 03:25.443
-until I fuck it up.
-Oh, you won't.

03:27.450 --> 03:28.280
Not us.

03:39.710 --> 03:43.498
[Clay] Look, don't you get it?
It has to be the Clubhouse.

03:44.890 --> 03:45.709
Right.

03:47.470 --> 03:49.267
-Are you high?
-Jesus.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.306
No.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.642
-I can't bring that shit home again.
-I'm not.

03:55.690 --> 03:56.600
I'm just tired.

03:58.150 --> 04:01.734
So, if you weren't using, what have you
been doing the past 48 hours?

04:02.070 --> 04:03.981
-I saw my mom.
-Your mom?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.021
I thought you didn't know where she moved.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.940
Well, turns out I lie sometimes.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.993
-Wait, so you went home?
-No, I saw my mom.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.411
She gave me some cash.

04:18.710 --> 04:23.579
-She gave you that?
-Here. It's for you. Consider it rent.

04:23.970 --> 04:28.043
-Till I can find something permanent.
-Keep it. I don't pay rent anyway. So...

04:29.720 --> 04:33.304
If you have all that cash...
why'd you call me?

04:34.980 --> 04:36.049
You said you needed me.

04:39.610 --> 04:43.239
I'm just-- I'm done
with doing fucked-up things.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.946
[sighs] Yeah.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.447
I may need you to do
one or two more fucked-up things.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.860
[shower running]

04:59.090 --> 05:04.255
[Tony] Me, I try to be a good friend...
in the way I know how.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.289
[door creaks]

05:10.970 --> 05:11.800
[door closes]

05:16.140 --> 05:17.095
He came back.

05:18.900 --> 05:19.764
Yeah.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.068
Eventually, you have to stop running,
I guess.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.776
I'm sorry... about the other night.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.776
You didn't say anything I didn't deserve.

05:47.970 --> 05:49.676
I'm angry all the time, Hannah.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.636
I have been since you died.

05:56.430 --> 05:57.556
And I can't tell anyone.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.970
You should tell someone.

06:02.610 --> 06:03.895
Someone who's alive.

06:08.570 --> 06:09.480
I tried to forget you.

06:11.990 --> 06:13.446
I tried so hard.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.205
Then I think of...

06:18.920 --> 06:20.410
sitting on the roof of the Crestmont.

06:21.790 --> 06:24.953
Or building towers of candy boxes.

06:31.010 --> 06:34.093
Star Wars more than Star Trek,
but sometimes Star Trek.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.348
Or walking me home from work,
or having lunch together.

06:37.850 --> 06:38.839
Or kissing you.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.510
I can't forget kissing you.

06:42.980 --> 06:45.312
I think maybe it was
the happiest I've ever been.

06:48.110 --> 06:49.441
For, like, 15 seconds.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.691
I'd give anything to kiss you again.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.250
But you can't.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.090
Even

07:23.560 --> 07:24.800
Then why are you here?

07:32.320 --> 07:34.982
[Tony] I sometimes let my anger
get the best of me.

07:36.030 --> 07:38.487
[Montgomery] Maybe it was one of those
bitches who follows Hannah's mom.

07:38.580 --> 07:39.786
The one with all the signs.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.911
They'll have all this cleaned up
by game time.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.416
So let's get our heads
back in the game, guys.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.008
We can let this get to us,
or we can take the field tonight

07:50.090 --> 07:51.626
and show these people who we really are.

07:52.090 --> 07:53.751
And who exactly are we, Coach?

07:54.220 --> 07:57.428
-Apparently, we're the rapists.
-I don't want to hear that talk, okay?

07:57.760 --> 08:00.137
We got a championship season ahead of us
starting tonight.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.050
Gonna to prove these people wrong.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.267
How does winning a baseball game
prove we're not rapists?

08:04.600 --> 08:05.897
Got something to say, Dempsey?

08:06.940 --> 08:08.896
No. Nothing. You got something to say?

08:09.530 --> 08:12.192
-No. I'll save it for court tomorrow.
-Okay, that's enough.

08:12.740 --> 08:16.312
Ten minutes of long toss.
Let's go! Go, go, go!

08:19.540 --> 08:20.655
[Tony] Or ifI don't...

08:22.120 --> 08:23.405
it eats me up inside.

08:32.090 --> 08:33.045
Did you sleep okay?

08:34.380 --> 08:35.210
Hmm?

08:35.680 --> 08:36.715
Do you feel okay?

08:37.640 --> 08:38.925
Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

08:43.180 --> 08:44.135
What is he doing here?

08:44.890 --> 08:47.267
You said he was gone.
You said he ran away.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.261
Hey, he didn't--
What are you doing? Dad.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.102
-What have you got to say for yourself?
-[Jessica] People are watching.

08:53.190 --> 08:55.067
-I don't give a damn.
-I do! Hey!

08:55.660 --> 08:57.525
Who do you think you're hurting right now?

08:58.660 --> 09:00.867
-What this boy did to you--
-He didn't do it.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.663
Dad, please, just get in the car.

09:07.170 --> 09:08.706
[Tony] When we act out of anger...

09:10.040 --> 09:10.950
or fear...

09:11.880 --> 09:13.871
You be very careful of yourself,
young man.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.757
[Tony] ...we can hurt people
we don't mean to hurt.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.980
After I hooked up with her ex,

09:41.280 --> 09:43.077
she called me a slut,

09:44.870 --> 09:45.700
a whore,

09:47.540 --> 09:48.666
a fat bitch.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.839
-[Sonya] And this was Lindsay?
-Yeah.

09:53.170 --> 09:56.628
And, like, I could handle it
when it was just one-on-one with her,

09:56.720 --> 10:00.008
but when the three of them piled on,
it was-- it was too much.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.841
[Sonya] And can you please name

10:02.930 --> 10:05.421
all three girls who bullied you
at Ridgeview High?

10:05.850 --> 10:10.184
Lindsay Patterson, Alicia Morris,
Hannah Baker.

10:12.110 --> 10:14.226
They called me "Suck-Me-Sarah."

10:14.320 --> 10:19.849
They created a Facebook group where
people posted awful memes about me.

10:20.160 --> 10:25.029
They'd always find ways to accidentally
run into me in class,

10:25.290 --> 10:26.530
or on the bus,

10:28.870 --> 10:34.297
or in the bathroom, which is where
I ended up eating most of my lunches.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.409
And did you ever tell anyone?

10:38.420 --> 10:39.250
My mom.

10:42.510 --> 10:45.001
She told the school,
and they were all suspended for a week.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.769
[Sonya] Following this suspension,
did the bullying continue?

10:49.850 --> 10:54.219
[Sarah] Yes and no. Lindsay, Alicia,
and Hannah, they left me alone,

10:54.320 --> 10:57.312
but everyone else at Ridgeview hated me

10:58.110 --> 10:59.520
for, you know, being a narc.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.025
I knew it wouldn't get better.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.692
It couldn't. Not there.

11:08.790 --> 11:09.859
So I dropped out.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.031
[Sonya] So you dropped out of school
as a result

11:13.130 --> 11:16.497
of the bullying by these girls,
including Hannah Baker?

11:16.800 --> 11:17.755
[Sarah] Yeah.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.659
[Sonya] No further questions, Your Honor.

11:26.220 --> 11:28.882
Look, we need to get in there.
We've got a plan.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.776
-B_oom.
-SerIously?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.852
That's the plan? Put those away.

11:42.070 --> 11:45.278
-What? Why?
-Why not just break down the door?

11:45.450 --> 11:49.159
-Because then the choor would be broken.
- es.

11:51.330 --> 11:55.573
What I'm saying is we gotta do it without
tipping them off that we were there.

11:55.670 --> 11:57.797
-And we do that how?
-[sighs]

11:58.170 --> 12:00.001
Let me handle this. I'll text you.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.256
[Nina] What do they think
that's actually gonna accomplish?

12:03.430 --> 12:05.751
It's probably just some losers
who just wanted attention

12:05.850 --> 12:07.556
and don't give a shit about who it hurts.

12:08.350 --> 12:09.590
Who does it hurt, though?

12:10.600 --> 12:13.728
I mean, you and me

12:13.810 --> 12:16.392
and anyone who just wants our shit
to be ours, you know?

12:16.980 --> 12:19.892
-Not, like, burned into a field.
-Right.

12:20.650 --> 12:24.734
-But nobody really knows about you.
-You know what I mean.

12:25.660 --> 12:29.949
Dear God, are these the two
most beautiful girls at Liberty High?

12:30.370 --> 12:35.319
Hold on, hold on, let me see.
Just a closer inspection. Yeah. Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.992
Uh-huh. The most beautiful.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.417
And I believe one Damon Dawes
from Washington agrees,

12:42.590 --> 12:46.219
seeing that he's been blowing up my phone
about this girl he met yesterday.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.177
-Right? Right?
-Yeah, that's nice.

12:48.260 --> 12:52.299
In fact, I've been deputized by Mr. Dawes
to invite you to his place tonight.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.049
Yeah, I can't.

12:56.480 --> 13:00.109
-My dad's, like, crazy on me today, 50--
-[Michael] Just think about it.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.851
-And I'll see you at practice.
-Yes, you will.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.230
This is me. I'll see you.

13:11.450 --> 13:12.656
[Tony] Hey, what's up, Ryan?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.365
Still doing that Internet thing?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.991
I'm sorry, we can't all bump
into hot boyfriends

13:18.080 --> 13:19.411
every time we walk into a boxing gym.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.792
Besides, aren't you testifying today?
Why are you here?

13:23.130 --> 13:25.257
Yeah, I'm up last.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.172
They don't let you in the courtroom
unless you've already gone.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.348
-I wasn't gonna wait at home.
-Aren't your folks going?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.596
No, they're, uh-- They're working.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.010
Do you want me to go?

13:38.190 --> 13:40.761
Jesus Christ, no. No. That is all I need.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.270
Fine.

13:45.990 --> 13:48.697
Hey, I don't think it's gonna come up.

13:48.910 --> 13:50.650
-Not here.
-No, I'm just saying--

13:50.740 --> 13:51.775
Just fucking drop it, okay?

13:53.870 --> 13:54.689
Fine.

-I don't know about this.
-Why?

14:05.920 --> 14:09.754
I don't know, I mean, look at him.
He's staring at himself in the mirror.

14:10.390 --> 14:11.709
Like you don't use a mirror.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.382
How much pomade does it take you
every morning to look like that?

14:14.470 --> 14:15.596
That's not the point.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.228
The point is, we're too different.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.188
Different is good, okay?
Opposites attract and all that.

14:22.270 --> 14:23.897

-No.

14:28.070 --> 14:30.026
Okay, okay. Seize the day.
Seize the fucking day.

14:30.110 --> 14:30.940
Seize the day.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.156
Oh, my, my, my...

14:34.370 --> 14:38.204
Tony Padilla.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

14:38.790 --> 14:40.417
I uh... I think you're cute...

14:41.500 --> 14:43.206
um, and funny...

14:43.750 --> 14:47.584
and you have a way with words
that I'm not entirely sure I understand--

14:47.670 --> 14:49.797
I am flattered and a-flutter.

14:50.470 --> 14:53.041
Yeah. My point is, I like you.

14:55.140 --> 14:56.880
And I think you like me?

14:58.310 --> 15:01.393
And I'm, you know...
Words are not really my thing,

15:01.810 --> 15:04.722
so I'm not gonna
say anything clever or cute.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.060
Ijust, um...

15:08.190 --> 15:09.441
Wanna go to an art show with me?

15:13.490 --> 15:14.400
You did your research.

15:16.870 --> 15:20.158
What took you so long to finally
come to your senses and ask me out?

15:23.080 --> 15:26.334
I'm "carpe dieming," apparently.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.796
Seizing the freaking day.

15:29.090 --> 15:29.909
[chuckles]

15:31.260 --> 15:34.844
I like it. You do realize that means
"pluck the day," though, right?

15:36.350 --> 15:37.590
Uh-- Saturday.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.056
My, my, my...

15:39.600 --> 15:42.342
At 5:00. Text me your address?

15:47.110 --> 15:48.065
My, my, my...

15:48.650 --> 15:49.810
[Tony laughs]

15:52.660 --> 15:54.104
-If this backfires...
-Yeah?

15:54.200 --> 15:57.112
-...I'm coming straight to you.
-Okay, I will be there for you always.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.861
[class bell rings]

16:07.000 --> 16:08.410
[sighs] Good morning.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.881
-Uh, I'll talk to you later.
-All right.

16:22.350 --> 16:23.180
Kevin.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.515
Gary, good morning.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.976
Yeah. I wasn't expecting to see you here
this morning.

16:29.270 --> 16:30.146
Why not?

16:32.740 --> 16:35.812
Well, your employment record
is currently under review

16:35.910 --> 16:38.151
-by the superintendent's office.
-Well, I'm aware.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.571
I'm sure you'll let me know
what they decide.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.997
All right. So, uh...

16:44.080 --> 16:46.913
I mean, what-- what did you think
was going to happen next?

16:47.420 --> 16:48.375
I'm just curious.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.952
I didn't game it out, Gary.
I spoke my truth.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.540
So, you thought it was coincidental

16:53.630 --> 16:56.713
_ that our field was vandalized
just hours after you spoke your truth?

16:57.970 --> 17:00.882
The field was vandalized
for one reason only.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.383
And he'll be taking the stand
and have plenty of time to defend himself.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.299
Yeah, okay.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.102
Well, until the superintendent's review
is completed,

17:12.190 --> 17:14.988
I think it's best that you have
no direct contact with any students.

17:15.070 --> 17:15.889
You understand?

17:16.280 --> 17:20.023
You don't straighten a kid's collar
without consulting me first.

17:20.450 --> 17:22.486
-Are we clear?
-Yes, Sir, we're clear.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.496
[Tony] Even when you try to do
the right thing...

17:30.210 --> 17:31.700
it can get you into trouble.

17:43.470 --> 17:45.176
How did you guys even find this place?

17:46.020 --> 17:49.308
Find? No, you don't find the Clubhouse...

17:51.360 --> 17:54.432
-You're invited.
-Oh, shit. I just realized,

17:54.530 --> 17:57.818
-I have a test today, fourth period--
-[Bryce] Sheri fucking Holland.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.690
Never thought I'd see you here.

18:01.450 --> 18:02.485
[Scott] She came bearing gifts.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.651
Oh, shit. [chuckles]

18:08.080 --> 18:09.286
Juvie was good for you.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.586
All right, ladies first.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.376
[Tony] High school can be messed up.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.005
People can get hurt.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.170
Hannah wanted people to know about that.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.308
So you're saying she wanted them
to suffer like she was suffering?

18:29.440 --> 18:32.011
-[Dennis] Objection. Leading.
-I'|| rephrase.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.683
Tony, why did Hannah want you to make sure
that people listened to the tapes?

18:37.190 --> 18:38.100
Uh...

18:39.820 --> 18:42.152
To-- So that they would understand.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.906
Understand what?

18:45.160 --> 18:46.195
What she was going through.

18:46.540 --> 18:50.909
And what, to the best of your knowledge,
was she going through?

18:55.550 --> 18:56.915
Uh, she was in a lot of pain.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.922
And so she wanted the recipients
of those tapes to feel pain as well?

19:01.470 --> 19:03.927
-No, I don't think that's--
-She didn't want them to feel pain?

19:06.180 --> 19:07.090
I guess so.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.171
And, in your experience,
is that what a bully does?

19:10.890 --> 19:13.108
Uh, she wanted them
to be held accountable.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.722
And she wanted you to make sure
that they got the message, correct?

19:17.610 --> 19:20.773
-Yes, ma'am.
-In fact, you held onto the tapes,

19:21.110 --> 19:22.816
stayed quiet for weeks

19:23.370 --> 19:25.326
before you finally
gave them to her parents,

19:25.410 --> 19:27.947
who ultimately alerted
the proper authorities, correct?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.412
-Correct, yeah.
-Because it was so important

19:32.210 --> 19:34.280
that you made sure that the individuals

19:34.590 --> 19:36.831
got the message
that they were responsible.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.205
[Dennis] Objection. Leading.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.679
Tony, did Hannah ever blame the school
on her tapes?

19:42.430 --> 19:46.218
It was the way the school was, that they
did nothing at all to help her after she--

19:46.310 --> 19:50.303
Did Hannah at any point say,
"I blame the school"?

19:57.900 --> 19:58.719
No.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.578
-No further questions.
-It's not fair. You don't understand

20:06.660 --> 20:08.321
-what she was going through--
-Nothing further.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.069
You wanna break her in?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.126
It's a new pipe.
Do you want to do the honors?

20:18.420 --> 20:22.254
Oh. Yeah, but I have papers.

20:22.550 --> 20:23.926
Oh, come on.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.216
Hit that shit, girl.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.590
Come on.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.227
What the fuck is that? Really?

20:36.310 --> 20:38.358
You call that a hit? Come on. Hit it hard.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.259
Be a man.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.066
-Again.
-All right.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.275
Atta girl.

20:47.490 --> 20:48.616
Oh, shit.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.530
-[coughing]
-[laughs]

20:50.620 --> 20:51.780
-That's a good hit.
-Here.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.497
-No, I'm pitching tonight.
-What?

20:54.580 --> 20:55.410
Yeah.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.411
Okay, fine. Here, Scott.

20:58.630 --> 21:01.201
Uh, and these two idiots are also playing.

21:01.590 --> 21:02.625
-Come on.
-SerIously?

21:02.710 --> 21:04.678
-Fuck. Come on.
-Guess you're on your own.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.880
Picture time.

21:11.140 --> 21:13.131
No, I look like shit.

21:13.770 --> 21:16.477
Come on, it's tradition.
No one leaves without taking a shot.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.390
Come on.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.641
And you couldn't look like shit
if you tried.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.816
All right. Yeah, get a little closer.

21:24.990 --> 21:27.481
There it is. Smile, bitches.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.985
[clicks, whirrs]

21:37.830 --> 21:40.537
They put my picture in this box
with, like, a hundred others.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.746
-Like-- Like trophies?
-[Justin] Insurance.

21:43.380 --> 21:45.871
What happens in the Clubhouse
stays in the Clubhouse.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.461
We have to get those pictures.
We'll go during the game.

21:49.390 --> 21:52.848
-You go. I'm out.
-Wait. Why?

21:54.520 --> 21:55.805
I can't go back there.

21:58.810 --> 21:59.765
Yeah, I get it.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.697
-Nina! Hey.
-Hey.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.020
Can I talk to you for a sec?

22:10.450 --> 22:13.908
Yeah. Um, I mean,
Michael's waiting for me

22:13.990 --> 22:17.539
'cause we try to get in a few miles
at lunch, but... what's up?

22:17.660 --> 22:19.070
Yeah, about that.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.200
Did, like, something happen
between you and Garrett?

22:22.960 --> 22:24.166
No. Why?

22:24.630 --> 22:28.179
Come on. You're the person
who tells me the truth.

22:29.470 --> 22:33.509
[sighs] Well, I mean,
nothing happened, really.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.387
It's just, he's just been
getting on my nerves lately.

22:36.810 --> 22:39.597
He wants to go all deep
and talk about our feelings all the time.

22:39.690 --> 22:40.554
It's exhausting.

22:41.060 --> 22:41.970
Your feelings?

22:45.440 --> 22:47.396
He's been asking questions, okay?

22:48.110 --> 22:51.739
Just based off some stuff that happened,
like, physically with us.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.150
So...

22:53.490 --> 22:56.152
Shit. Okay. I get that.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.822
But, I mean, most guys don't even bother
asking questions.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.285
Maybe it's a good thing.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.701
How?
I don't want to talk about that with him.

23:05.170 --> 23:06.501
Well, you talk about it with me.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.126
Yeah, because you understand it.

23:08.550 --> 23:11.758
-How do you know he won't?
-It'|| just get in the way.

23:11.930 --> 23:13.670
So you just start up with Michael?

23:13.930 --> 23:16.342
And what happens if he starts
asking questions, too?

23:16.810 --> 23:20.132
Well, you just started up with Damon,
and that seemed to go all right, so--

23:20.230 --> 23:22.016
It didn't! It was a big mistake.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.062
I freaked out and I started sleeping
on my parents' floor again.

23:25.150 --> 23:26.686
Well, then you gave too much.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.407
I feel like maybe you haven't dealt
with all your shit after all.

23:33.820 --> 23:35.947
Oh, so you're gonna tell me now?

23:36.700 --> 23:38.941
While you walk around staring at Justin
like you're still in love?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.247
I mean, what's that about?
Deal with that shit.

23:46.130 --> 23:49.122
You know, I was just trying to help you,
J, but maybe that was a mistake.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.079
[scoffs]

24:15.740 --> 24:16.729
Hey.

24:18.330 --> 24:19.285
Come on, let's talk.

24:20.580 --> 24:22.400
I can't really--

24:35.090 --> 24:37.388
As long as you don't miss
any more of the semester

24:37.470 --> 24:39.756
and you sign up for summer school,

24:40.270 --> 24:42.556
I think I can help you
get you the credits you need

24:42.640 --> 24:45.347
so you can graduate
with your class... barely.

24:46.650 --> 24:49.437
-Thank you.
-Can you get your shit together?

24:50.650 --> 24:52.561
-Can you get the grades?
-Yes.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.157
Spoken to your mother
since you've been back?

24:58.660 --> 25:01.697
-I don't know where she is.
-Bullshit. I visited her last week.

25:02.540 --> 25:06.249
And I know she's staying at the house
her boyfriend used to cook in

25:06.330 --> 25:07.706
till he had to take it out of town.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.030
How do you even know about--

25:09.130 --> 25:11.121
I know that you're staying
with Clay Jensen now.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.791
So, what is your plan, long-term?

25:17.970 --> 25:22.384
I'll find a job, find a place.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.590
I'm used to being on my own, okay?

25:25.980 --> 25:28.767
And how has that worked out for you,
being on your own?

25:31.940 --> 25:32.770
Justin...

25:33.900 --> 25:35.948
I'm not gonna be at this job much longer.

25:36.110 --> 25:39.489
And whoever replaces me is gonna want you
back at your mom's house.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.529
Listen.

25:50.340 --> 25:55.039
This is gonna be hard for you,
and you need to let people help.

25:56.630 --> 25:58.928
And you need to let go
of your past wrongs

25:59.340 --> 26:01.422
and figure out what can you do right.

26:02.390 --> 26:03.209
You understand?

26:05.980 --> 26:07.470
Justin, take care of yourself.

26:08.980 --> 26:09.799
Yes, sir.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.179
I will.

26:14.990 --> 26:19.689
[Tony] My anger is so powerful sometimes,
I don't know what to do with it.

26:50.600 --> 26:54.309
Isn't it true you're currently enrolled
in a program for anger management?

26:54.610 --> 26:55.429
Yes, sir.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.771
And this program
is specifically designed for people

26:57.860 --> 27:00.351
who struggle with physical violence
and aggression, correct?

27:10.250 --> 27:11.535
Uh, yeah, that's correct.

27:11.620 --> 27:15.454
Isn't it true that the court ordered you
to take part in this program, Tony?

27:16.460 --> 27:17.290
Um...

27:22.180 --> 27:25.001
It's a condition of my probation, yes.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.843
And isn't it true that this probation
stems from an arrest for assault?

27:30.980 --> 27:33.221
-Two arrests, yeah.
-Two strikes.

27:33.810 --> 27:35.971
One more and you could be sent
to juvenile detention, correct?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.178
Uh, yeah.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.647
Isn't it true that in the first assault,
you jumped a man from behind?

27:41.740 --> 27:43.367
I caught him breaking into my car.

27:43.450 --> 27:47.159
And in the second, you and your brothers
ganged up on an innocent man, correct?

27:47.240 --> 27:51.153
He wasn't innocent. He was a drug dealer
and he was selling drugs to my sister.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.706
But he had no record, is that correct?

28:00.920 --> 28:01.750
No, he didn't.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.960
You can't help but lash out
when provoked, can you?

28:08.310 --> 28:10.301
[Tony] You know that horoscope stuff
is bullshit, right?

28:11.640 --> 28:14.518
You really think a planet
billions of light-years away

28:14.600 --> 28:18.058
-can affect your lotto numbers?
-[Ryan chuckles]

28:18.150 --> 28:20.641
[Ryan] You know, Scorpios
are very skeptical by nature.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.640
-[chuckles]
-But luckily, I'm a Leo,

28:22.740 --> 28:24.310
-which means I can handle you.
-Yeah?

28:24.410 --> 28:26.526
We're both emotional, though,
in completely different ways,

28:26.620 --> 28:29.407
which means we'll probably wind up
killing each other at some point.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.616
Well, that's encouraging.

28:31.160 --> 28:35.369
But in the meantime, the sex is going
to be, like, mind-blowing.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.877
-Oh, you think so, huh?
-I do.

28:38.460 --> 28:41.839
I've had a really nice time today,
which means my horoscope was right.

28:45.510 --> 28:48.047
What, so, you like me, but you don't
want to kiss me in public?

28:48.140 --> 28:49.209
-It's not that.
-Is that it?

28:49.310 --> 28:52.973
No, Ijust, uh-- I think I should
take things slow for once.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.643
Besides, if we're gonna end up
killing each other,

28:58.770 --> 29:00.772
we should make the most
of our time together.

29:01.820 --> 29:02.730
Faggots.

29:03.780 --> 29:04.644
What did you just say?

29:05.860 --> 29:06.906
Which one is the wife?

29:06.990 --> 29:08.776
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Just ignore him.

29:08.870 --> 29:11.691
It's the let century,
you fucking asshole.

29:11.790 --> 29:12.609
Fuck you, faggot.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.110
-Huh?
-Whoa.

29:14.210 --> 29:18.032
-Say it to my face.
-Tony. Tony. Tony, let's go.

29:18.130 --> 29:19.950
-You should listen to your bitch.
-Whoa.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.372
-You should shut your mouth.
-Don't touch me, faggot!

29:23.340 --> 29:26.002
-Tony! Tony, stop!
-Get off.

29:27.590 --> 29:28.466
[groans]

29:28.600 --> 29:30.420
-Tony! We have to go!
-Get out of here!

29:30.970 --> 29:33.382
[grunting]

29:42.400 --> 29:43.526
[man] Call the police.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.732
[bystander] Nine-one-one? Yeah...

29:48.490 --> 29:49.866
Uh...

29:51.580 --> 29:52.399
Where I live...

29:54.160 --> 29:58.369
sometimes you gotta
take matters into your own hands.

29:58.580 --> 30:01.663
So you follow your own sense of justice,
is that correct?

30:02.670 --> 30:03.500
Yes, sir.

30:03.590 --> 30:05.967
So shouldn't we regard
your testimony today

30:06.760 --> 30:08.375
as coming from your own sense of justice?

30:08.590 --> 30:10.171
-Objection.
-Withdrawn.

30:10.470 --> 30:13.519
Tony, when Hannah left the tapes
at your door,

30:13.970 --> 30:14.880
did she say anything?

30:18.230 --> 30:19.720
Uh, no. I didn't talk to her.

30:19.810 --> 30:23.394
And what about a note?
Did she leave any written instructions?

30:33.240 --> 30:34.286
No, just the tapes.

30:34.370 --> 30:35.530
So when you stated earlier

30:36.410 --> 30:38.867
that Hannah blamed the people
she named on the tapes

30:38.960 --> 30:40.109
and wanted them to suffer,

30:40.210 --> 30:42.030
you were making an assumption,
isn't that correct?

30:42.130 --> 30:44.246
I don't think I was making
an assumption that--

30:45.590 --> 30:46.409
[Tony] Mrs. Baker...

30:48.880 --> 30:50.836
Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.

30:52.890 --> 30:53.800
I wanted to honor that.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.262
Yes, I was.
Yeah, I was making an assumption.

30:59.350 --> 31:01.227
An assumption not based
on your knowledge of Hannah

31:01.310 --> 31:03.016
or her intentions, isn't that correct?

31:05.570 --> 31:06.559
-Yes.
-And isn't it true

31:06.650 --> 31:08.732
that there's no particular reason
why Hannah chose you

31:08.820 --> 31:10.356
-to receive those tapes?
-Yes.

31:10.450 --> 31:13.578
So isn't it true you have no way
of knowing why Hannah left those tapes?

31:17.080 --> 31:17.899
Yes.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.624
We're brothers.

31:33.510 --> 31:36.217
All of us. I mean, we're fucking family.

31:38.350 --> 31:41.899
There's been... there's been a lot of shit
thrown our way recently.

31:41.980 --> 31:44.551
There are a lot of people
who are trying to tear us apart,

31:44.650 --> 31:46.311
but family stays together.

31:47.860 --> 31:49.896
Look, you guys, they can burn our field,

31:49.990 --> 31:52.356
but they can't change the ground
beneath it.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.521
That ground out there is sacred.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.987
That ground is where we make our stand.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.698
The world is divided between people
who get that and the people who don't.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.456
And I also just want to say that

32:03.540 --> 32:05.781
I'm proud to be sharing the field
with each and every one of you...

32:07.590 --> 32:08.796
because we're all fighters.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.166
We're winners. And we stand together.

32:11.670 --> 32:12.967
I fucking love you guys.

32:13.050 --> 32:15.712
-Aww!
-We love you, too, Brycey!

32:15.930 --> 32:17.170
All right, all right.

32:17.260 --> 32:20.058
Let's get out there
and let's fucking do this!

32:20.430 --> 32:21.886
[cheering]

32:41.160 --> 32:42.741
[man] Strike him out, Bryce! Let's go!

32:43.210 --> 32:44.279
[woman] Come on, Bryce!

32:47.340 --> 32:48.625
[umpire] Strike three!

32:48.710 --> 32:49.790
[fans cheering]

32:51.710 --> 32:54.008
[Tony] I can't explain how she was feeling

32:54.090 --> 32:56.001
or what exactly she was trying to say.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.000
But even if I can't say
how she was feeling,

33:00.100 --> 33:02.671
I can still tell you
the kind of person she was.

33:04.270 --> 33:05.589
I can tell you she was brave

33:06.600 --> 33:07.430
andloyaL"

33:10.440 --> 33:11.680
[fans whooping]

33:17.370 --> 33:18.314
[umpire] Strike!

33:18.410 --> 33:19.946
[cheering]

33:26.710 --> 33:30.202
[Tony] ...and always tried to do
the right thing, even when it wasn't easy.

33:30.290 --> 33:32.258
-I wanted the change-up.
-I wanted to throw the heat.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.160
-He's catching up to you.
-Not yet, he's not.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.466
Just give me the change-up, okay?

33:39.180 --> 33:40.295
[woman] Come on, guys!

33:42.140 --> 33:43.095
[spits]

33:54.030 --> 33:55.236
[umpire] Strike three!

33:55.320 --> 33:56.639
[cheering]

33:57.820 --> 33:58.650
Time!

33:58.910 --> 33:59.979
Time!

34:03.790 --> 34:06.532
-What are you doing?
-That's 5 Ks in a row with the fastball.

34:06.620 --> 34:08.497
-Why fuck that up?
-Why didn't you shake me off?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.878
[Bryce] Why don't you just catch
what I throw and be happy?

34:10.960 --> 34:12.916
It's when you start thinking
that shit gets fucked up.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.082
[Zach] You just gave a whole
fucking speech about teamwork,

34:15.170 --> 34:17.627
-but that was bullshit, too, wasn't it?
-Fuck is your problem?

34:17.720 --> 34:20.848
You're my fucking problem. We both know
that Hannah didn't lie on those tapes.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.468
Zach, come on, man.
We leave this stuff off the field, right?

34:25.350 --> 34:27.011
Sorry, Coach. I can't anymore.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.261
Dempsey. Dempsey, come on!

34:30.940 --> 34:31.929
Seriously?

34:48.330 --> 34:51.743
You'd think they'd know better
than to just leave this shit lying around.

34:51.830 --> 34:54.207
Except then they'd know better
than to take pictures in the first place.

35:00.010 --> 35:00.829
Shit.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.466
-What are you doing in here?
-[Clay] We know about the Clubhouse.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.050
We know everything,
and we're not the only ones.

35:07.310 --> 35:09.266
Oh, you know everything? I don't think so.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.549
We know enough.

35:10.650 --> 35:14.472
-Hey, just back off, Dempsey.
-Or what, Justin?

35:15.070 --> 35:15.889
Gonna come at me?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.140
I wasn't scared of you
even before you fell apart.

35:18.780 --> 35:19.849
Do what you want, Zach.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.906
I've had the shit beat out of me
once this week already.

35:21.990 --> 35:23.480
It's not gonna stop us.

35:24.030 --> 35:25.110
-Rea|ly?
-Yes.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.861
'Cause it's gonna keep happening, Clay.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.458
To you, too, Justin. It doesn't stop.

35:30.790 --> 35:33.076
You can't take shots at the top
and expect to not get hit back.

35:35.630 --> 35:36.540
I'm not afraid.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.119
Good.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.050
You already have three of these.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.266
There's the rest.

35:52.690 --> 35:53.679
Wait, wait.

35:55.690 --> 35:59.069
It was you? Why the big mystery?
Why couldn't you just talk to me?

35:59.150 --> 36:01.448
-Tell me what was going on?
-'Cause I'm a fucking coward.

36:03.990 --> 36:04.809
And you're not.

36:10.580 --> 36:13.322
[Tony] I try to do right by my friends,
to be strong.

36:13.750 --> 36:14.569
[door closes]

36:19.670 --> 36:21.797
To be true... like Hannah.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.006
[door unlocks, opens]

36:27.470 --> 36:28.380
Sorry!

36:29.220 --> 36:30.175
[door shuts]

36:30.430 --> 36:31.306
Phil...

36:32.640 --> 36:34.722
mixed up two prescriptions.

36:34.810 --> 36:38.268
Well, nearly. It was a disaster. It--

36:40.860 --> 36:41.770
Jackie?

37:01.960 --> 37:03.336
[sighs]

37:24.700 --> 37:27.237
[Tony] But sometimes a friendship
can't take the truth.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.288
So you find yourself
trying to be someone you're not.

37:34.830 --> 37:37.162
-[voices overlapping]
-[faint music playing]

37:47.180 --> 37:47.999
Sorry.

37:49.720 --> 37:50.539
Sorry.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.596
Excuse me.

37:53.390 --> 37:54.926
Just... very sorry.

37:56.810 --> 38:00.109
Asshole! You're just in time.
The set's about to start.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.431
Should we try and find a spot
closer to the stage?

38:02.530 --> 38:04.486
Yeah, let's go.
The boys are already up there.

38:04.570 --> 38:06.481
-We should get going.
-You never...

38:08.660 --> 38:09.809
I mean, they're all here, too?

38:09.990 --> 38:12.788
Of course. They're not gonna miss
a good show. Let's go, come on!

38:12.870 --> 38:13.859
All right, coming through.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.656
-[Cyrus] Move, move, move.
-Sorry.

38:16.910 --> 38:19.071
-Hey!
-What's up? You made it.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.621
-You all ready?
-Yeah! Let's do this shit.

38:21.710 --> 38:23.837
-All right! Here we go again.
-[crowd cheering]

38:25.050 --> 38:25.914
Get the party started.

38:26.010 --> 38:28.001
[playing punk metal music]

38:37.600 --> 38:39.841
[screaming lyrics]

39:13.260 --> 39:15.342
[cheering]

39:28.530 --> 39:31.237
[music continues]

40:04.900 --> 40:06.356
It's rough out there tonight, huh?

40:06.650 --> 40:08.561
-Oh, my God, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.606
Okay. Can we talk?

40:12.700 --> 40:16.079
Because you've been avoiding me
for, like, two days straight.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.367
-No, I wasn't. I mean, I--
-No, it's okay.

40:18.990 --> 40:21.367
Look, I know what happened at the movies.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.997
-I don't know what you think happened--
-Don't have to be embarrassed.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.628
I even read that it's totally normal.
It's not even a thing.

40:26.710 --> 40:29.372
-Seriously, it happens--
-I know, but just shut up!

40:33.510 --> 40:34.636
Okay? Look, I--

40:36.050 --> 40:39.178
I don't know what you think happened,
but I left because you're fucking...

40:40.430 --> 40:44.548
boring and...
'cause I don't like you like that.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.352
What the fuck? Tyler?

40:50.990 --> 40:52.059
Okay, wait. No, hold on.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.198
Cyrus, just let--
No, let me explain real quick--

40:54.280 --> 40:57.113
No one fucking talks to my sister
like that.

41:00.290 --> 41:01.325
Get the fuck out.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.451
Get the fuck out!

41:05.540 --> 41:07.371
-[stammers]
-Go!

41:09.090 --> 41:09.909
Go!

41:12.550 --> 41:13.539
Get the fuck out!

41:20.850 --> 41:22.420
You must think I'm pretty messed up

41:23.430 --> 41:25.933
after hearing all that stuff
about me today, about my past.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.646
Obviously, it's not anything I'm proud of.

41:29.730 --> 41:32.062
Tony, we've all done things
we're not proud of.

41:34.820 --> 41:37.106
And they seem to find out
about the one thing...

41:40.580 --> 41:41.615
you wish they wouldn't.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.359
Actually, they didn't.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.293
Hannah didn't trust me with the tapes
because we were friends.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.871
She trusted me because I owed her.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.176
-Hannah--
-Shit, Tony, are you okay?

42:01.260 --> 42:03.216
I did something stupid.
The cops are coming.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.976
What? Why? What happened?

42:05.060 --> 42:07.187
Look, I can't get busted again.
I could get locked up.

42:07.270 --> 42:08.646
Please hide me.

42:10.150 --> 42:10.969
There's no time!

42:11.070 --> 42:12.935
[distant siren wails]

42:13.230 --> 42:14.527
Oh, shit, okay... uh...

42:15.610 --> 42:17.441
Go down the hall to the back office.

42:17.530 --> 42:18.565
I'll take care of it. Go!

42:18.660 --> 42:19.900
[siren chirps]

42:24.870 --> 42:25.689
Can I help you?

42:26.620 --> 42:28.201
Miss, we're responding to an assault.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.036
Oh, my God. An assault?

42:31.130 --> 42:33.872
Yeah, suspect is a Hispanic male,
late teens or early 20$,

42:33.960 --> 42:36.793
last seen fleeing on foot in the area,
wearing a black leather jacket.

42:37.170 --> 42:39.673
Have you seen anyone come in here
matching that description?

42:41.390 --> 42:42.675
No. No, I haven't.

42:44.430 --> 42:45.590
All right. [sighs]

42:49.270 --> 42:52.148
[door opens, shuts]

42:56.530 --> 43:00.352
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.

43:03.910 --> 43:05.366
I went too far, I know I did.

43:08.910 --> 43:12.038
I know you think I'm this sweet,
nice girl, but...

43:13.750 --> 43:15.741
I was an asshole to someone
at my old school.

43:17.670 --> 43:20.628
I was trying to fit in with these girls,
and they were ganging up on her.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.427
And I thought, better to be
one of them than to be her.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.209
So, what ended up happening?

43:27.560 --> 43:31.348
A bunch of stuff went down,
and, uh... now I'm here.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.237
I just-- I wish I could take it all back.

43:38.860 --> 43:39.690
You know?

43:46.950 --> 43:50.078
Hannah was a friend to me
and she kept my secrets.

43:50.660 --> 43:52.491
I wanted to do the same for her today.

43:54.250 --> 43:55.080
Thank you...

43:55.920 --> 43:58.081
for telling me that.

44:01.430 --> 44:03.580
I'm glad to know
that Hannah kept your secret.

44:05.550 --> 44:10.226
And I understand why she wanted
to protect you. I just--

44:11.890 --> 44:17.146
I wish I could've done that
for you today in court.

44:17.230 --> 44:20.142
No, it's my record. That's on me.

44:21.950 --> 44:22.769
Not you.

44:26.530 --> 44:29.328
[sighs] I guess we're all carrying
stuff around, right?

44:39.630 --> 44:40.449
What?

44:41.670 --> 44:42.750
[pinQS]

44:43.840 --> 44:44.920
No, you didn't.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.675
Fucking Marcus.

44:51.730 --> 44:53.220
Tyler, we need to talk.

44:53.810 --> 44:54.890
What happened to you?

44:55.770 --> 44:58.728
Nothing. I was at a concert with Cyrus.

44:59.190 --> 45:00.100
Uh, I'm fine.

45:01.190 --> 45:04.239
Listen, Tyler, Marcus Cole's father
was here a little while ago.

45:04.490 --> 45:07.948
He says that you and Cyrus
are blackmailing Marcus online?

45:08.740 --> 45:13.780
Okay, you guys, Marcus is a liar
and a creep, okay?

45:14.000 --> 45:17.913
He goes around and acts like this
great guy, but he treats girls like crap.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.128
-Did you hear what was on his tape?
-Whatever Marcus did is beside the point.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.002
If you have a problem with someone,
you tell us or a teacher.

45:24.090 --> 45:26.217
You don't just go around
trying to settle the score.

45:26.300 --> 45:28.541
Honey, it's just not like you
to do something like this.

45:29.050 --> 45:30.881
Did Cyrus pressure you into doing this?

45:33.770 --> 45:34.589
He...

45:37.100 --> 45:38.852
He said it would teach Marcus a lesson.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.220
I don't want you spending time
with him anymore.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.356
Okay! Fine! Whatever. I won't.

45:44.450 --> 45:47.271
Good. But that doesn't mean
you don't still have consequences.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.772
We're gonna conﬁscate
all your electronics,

45:49.870 --> 45:50.859
starting with your phone.

45:51.790 --> 45:53.496
Okay? This behavior stops now.

45:55.500 --> 45:56.489
Okay.

45:57.710 --> 45:58.620
And your cameras.

45:59.630 --> 46:02.337
No. Please-- Mom...

46:03.340 --> 46:04.329
[Mr. Down] Sorry, Tyler.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.039
But, I...

46:16.690 --> 46:19.306
Hi. I don't know if you know who I am--

46:19.400 --> 46:20.355
No, I know who you are.

46:21.860 --> 46:23.316
I understand your anger.

46:25.150 --> 46:25.980
I do.

46:27.490 --> 46:29.310
I know you wanted
to get on that stand today

46:29.410 --> 46:31.321
and tell everyone
who you thought Hannah was.

46:32.620 --> 46:35.157
So did I, but I failed.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.200
And I'm here to make it right.

46:43.210 --> 46:44.416
She was a good person.

46:45.760 --> 46:46.966
She was a great friend.

46:49.550 --> 46:51.541
And what she did to you,
there's no excuse for that.

46:52.930 --> 46:54.170
I know she hurt you.

46:56.810 --> 46:57.845
She knew it, too.

47:00.190 --> 47:02.055
Now, I'm not asking you to forgive her,

47:03.730 --> 47:05.106
but you need to know she was sorry.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.521
She told me how sorry she felt.

47:23.290 --> 47:24.871
[faint buzzing]

47:27.130 --> 47:28.540
[buzzing]

47:29.510 --> 47:30.329
Hello.

47:31.970 --> 47:32.789
This is she.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.379
Oh, my God.

47:50.900 --> 47:51.730
Hi.

47:52.660 --> 47:54.446
Hi, I'm Olivia Baker.

48:02.210 --> 48:03.416
[glass crunches]

48:08.960 --> 48:12.088
[Tony] So I promised myself that
the next time things get tough for me,

48:12.180 --> 48:14.751
the next time I find myself struggling
or being tested...

48:17.390 --> 48:19.517
I'm gonna think about the example
she set for me...

48:23.730 --> 48:26.722
and hope that I can ﬁnd the strength
to do the right thing.

48:28.900 --> 48:31.858
[sighs] These photos go back, like, years.

48:32.150 --> 48:35.278
It's no wonder these fucking baseball guys
are so fucking tight.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.861
I mean, they're all covering
each other's asses for this shit.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.531
These poor girls.

48:43.750 --> 48:45.377
That's the thing I don't get. I mean...

48:45.960 --> 48:49.043
Why are these girls getting themselves
into this situation in the first place?

48:50.460 --> 48:53.213
Seriously, Clay?
You're gonna blame the girls?

48:53.630 --> 48:56.428
No, I just-- Look, I mean,
this girl's laughing.

48:56.800 --> 48:57.880
Like she's having fun.

48:59.390 --> 49:03.019
Oh, my God. This is Nina,
that girl on the track team.

49:03.350 --> 49:04.590
She's Jessica's friend.

49:06.020 --> 49:07.146
[Justin] Shit, really?

49:11.490 --> 49:13.640
Clay, you don't know
what was happening in this photo.

49:14.240 --> 49:15.559
And you don't know what happened after.

49:15.860 --> 49:18.021
But clearly, no one's forcing her
to be there.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.486
Look, girls don't just "get themselves"
into bad situations.

49:21.370 --> 49:23.907
Guys make the situations bad.

49:25.290 --> 49:28.919
You don't know what that feels like,
to be a girl in that room.

49:45.690 --> 49:48.306
Uh, yeah, no. I guess you're right.

49:49.020 --> 49:53.059
-I'm just saying it's complicated.
-[Clay whispers] Yeah.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.117
Shit. Shit, guys. Look.

50:05.000 --> 50:05.819
[Clay] Oh, my God.

50:12.380 --> 50:14.291
Wait, that's-- That's Chle.

50:17.300 --> 50:19.177
He did that to his own girlfriend?

50:20.180 --> 50:23.388
-This is how we take him down.
-What do you mean?

50:24.180 --> 50:25.761
She's unconscious in these pictures.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.884
He's fucking raping her.

50:29.310 --> 50:31.471
If we show her these,
maybe we can get her to report it.

50:32.570 --> 50:34.310
Maybe we can get her to turn against him.

50:34.400 --> 50:35.276
You think she will?

50:37.360 --> 50:38.440
I think we have to try.
