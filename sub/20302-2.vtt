NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.628 --> 00:06.172
All you have to do
is open the door a little so we can rap.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.215
(glass smashing)

00:07.298 --> 00:09.467
(chattering)

00:10.135 --> 00:10.969
Gun!

00:11.344 --> 00:13.638
(shots)

00:15.515 --> 00:18.518
It's Hill and Renko.
They're both in intensive care.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.937
<i>I won't lie to you, Francis.</i>
<i>It doesn't look good.</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:24.607
(officers chattering)

00:24.691 --> 00:26.317
ESTERHAUS: Item 17.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.821
Item 17 is the...

00:30.613 --> 00:32.699
matter of a complaint to Division

00:32.782 --> 00:37.746
concerning the unauthorized body searches
of female suspects.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.207
(loud murmuring, chattering)

00:42.459 --> 00:44.419
All right, let's settle down.

00:44.961 --> 00:48.965
Be reminded, female police officers will,
according to policy,

00:49.049 --> 00:52.677
perform all in-depth searches
of female suspects.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.346
-(murmuring, complaining)
-Is that perfectly lucid?

00:58.641 --> 00:59.976
All right, last item.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.352
The last item...

01:02.312 --> 01:05.398
Early this morning,
we had two more rape assaults

01:05.482 --> 01:07.525
up in St. James Park.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.279
Chances are one or both of them
fit the pattern of the eight others

01:11.362 --> 01:13.573
we've had in the vicinity
of the botanical gardens

01:13.656 --> 01:15.116
and the reservoir.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.286
In other words, we've got some
extremely bad animals out there

01:18.369 --> 01:19.913
that need apprehending.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.792
So, let's spend a little less time
flirting with the hookers

01:23.875 --> 01:26.920
and the waitresses
and put some heavy attention on that park.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.005
(murmuring, chattering)

01:30.673 --> 01:32.133
All right, let's roll.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.637
Hey! Let's be careful out there.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.682
(chattering)

01:44.395 --> 01:47.273
(toilet flushes)

01:47.357 --> 01:49.442
(buzzing)

01:49.526 --> 01:51.861
(door rattling)

01:57.617 --> 01:59.744
Uh, hold on a second.
I'll give you a hand.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.415
Is that you, Howard?

02:05.250 --> 02:06.751
HOWARD: Stand clear, Frank.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.129
(water sloshing)

02:09.212 --> 02:12.423
(panting, yelling)

02:16.094 --> 02:17.178
(grunts)

02:17.887 --> 02:20.890
(sighs, inhales, exhales)

02:22.892 --> 02:25.770
I don't like the indiscriminate use
of tae kwon do, Frank,

02:25.854 --> 02:28.189
but I cannot abide close confinement.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.866
It is a sorry state of affairs, Frank,

02:37.949 --> 02:39.868
I don't mind telling you,
maintenance-wise,

02:39.951 --> 02:42.787
when you have to fight your way
out of a men's room stall.

02:42.871 --> 02:47.876
I've issued numerous memoranda to Division
regarding that very subject, Howard.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.879
That left sideburn's
a little ragged, Frank.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.174
It's nothing personal.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.801
It's just symptomatic
of a far greater malaise.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.096
Oh? What might that be, Howard?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.431
HOWARD: Judas Priest, Frank!

03:01.514 --> 03:05.685
We are coming apart at the seams up here,
and you are dashing off memos to Division.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.730
Procedure, Howard. What can I tell you?

03:08.813 --> 03:09.981
HOWARD: Hang procedure.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.443
Mobilize a team of your more
domestically oriented female officers...

03:13.526 --> 03:14.903
and let's fix this place up.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.487
We start tolerating rusty hinges,

03:16.571 --> 03:18.865
and before you know it
we tolerate rusty minds.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.036
I appreciate your proposal, Howard.
I'll consider it.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.330
In the meantime,
have a most pleasant morning.

03:27.957 --> 03:28.917
<i>Au revoir, </i>Frank.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.836
(door opens, closes)

03:34.631 --> 03:37.383
(water splashing on floor)

03:37.467 --> 03:38.885
Leaping' lizards!

03:51.189 --> 03:52.982
(sighs)

04:01.074 --> 04:03.910
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:05.703
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:05.787 --> 04:09.582
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:10.166 --> 04:13.169
(theme music playing)

04:16.714 --> 04:20.635
(instrumental music playing)

05:16.274 --> 05:18.609
(chattering)

05:18.693 --> 05:20.570
Huerta Bail Bonds.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.656
Bail bonds, sir? Free for a fee.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.408
Bail bonds.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.577
Oh, don't be shy. Here, take two.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.370
Huerta Bail Bonds.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.123
Oh, my, my. A new face.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.958
New face, new friends.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.336
Huerta Bail Bonds.
Twenty-four-hour service.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.754
<i>Cuidado,</i> "Huerto."

05:37.837 --> 05:41.299
Esterhaus catches you advertising in here,
he's gonna 86 your keister.

05:41.382 --> 05:44.302
I-I'm not arguing.
Who was arguing? Am I arguing?

05:44.385 --> 05:46.471
Am I arguing? Huerta Bail Bonds!

05:46.554 --> 05:49.932
Half a block up and across the street!
Hold on, Renko, please.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.225
Check this out.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.479
My cousin had 'em printed up.
Brand-new slogan.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.648
"The blessing of freedom for a lousy 10%."

05:57.732 --> 06:00.068
-What do you think?
-I think you'd better get out of here.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.652
Oh, Renko, give me a break!

06:01.736 --> 06:04.739
He's okay! Relax! Relax!
Come on, excuse us!

06:04.822 --> 06:07.617
-I'm not even sure he's housebroken.
-Keep that devil away from me!

06:07.700 --> 06:09.535
Lower your voice, Renko.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.662
He's only responding
to your hostility, not his.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.374
-Henry, what is this?
-Sarge, could you open that door for me?

06:14.457 --> 06:17.668
Henry, you missed your calling.
You should have been a Mountie.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.254
-Hey, hi, there, fella.
-(barking)

06:21.047 --> 06:24.634
Hey, hey, easy, boy. Easy.
We're on your side, pal.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.136
-MAN 1: Pretty dog, huh?
-MAN 2: Yeah.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.390
Speak for yourself, Henry.
That dog is a cop-hater.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.849
He's just a stray.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.143
I'll have him out of here
in two hours, tops.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.270
(chuckles) Last time,
it took you two weeks.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.232
-(growls)
-HENRY: What am I supposed to do, Leo?

06:39.315 --> 06:41.901
Let him get picked up,
sent to the gas chamber?

06:41.984 --> 06:45.363
He can cop a plea
down to misdemeanor soiling.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.448
-(barks)
-SEYMOUR: Sir? Sir?

06:47.949 --> 06:50.201
I love dogs,
and I could really help you out.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.328
For instance, I could take him for a walk.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.704
Right away, if you'd like.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.706
-(cell door slams)
-Very creative, Seymour.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.625
Two hours, Leo.

06:58.167 --> 07:02.004
Just take me a couple of phone calls
to the proper adoption agencies.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.800
-Sure, Henry.
-(dog whining)

07:09.595 --> 07:12.056
-Can I help you?
-I have an appointment with Frank Furillo.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.099
The captain is tied up.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.059
-Maybe I can help you.
-I see him right there.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.854
-No, you can't come in, ma'am.
-Frank.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.230
Yes, that's right.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.318
Frank Furillo. How long has it been?

07:25.611 --> 07:26.654
How long?

07:28.906 --> 07:30.491
It's been a while.

07:31.075 --> 07:34.120
(laughs) You don't remember me.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.621
I'm sorry. I should.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.959
-We do know each other, don't we?
-I should hope so.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.794
Grace Gardner.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.838
Of course. Grace!

07:43.921 --> 07:46.007
How are you? You look wonderful!

07:46.090 --> 07:49.135
-Thank you.
-Grace, this is Lieutenant Ray Calletano.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.764
Ray, you remember
Chief of Detectives Sam Gardner.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.057
Pleasure.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.394
Uh, my condolences, Mrs. Gardner.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.605
Sam was a very fine man.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.149
Yes, Sam was okay. Thank you.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.194
-Well, this dump sure hasn't changed.
-Only the faces.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.820
What brings you up here?

08:07.904 --> 08:10.323
The stinker didn't call you.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.451
Chief Daniels promised me faithfully
that he would warn you

08:13.534 --> 08:15.703
so that my moving in
wouldn't come as a shock.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.288
-Moving in?
-Darn that man!

08:17.371 --> 08:18.748
I thought you knew.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.667
I'm sorry. I'll explain.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.545
After Sam died,

08:24.629 --> 08:28.174
I decided to pull some strings
and come to work for the department.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.675
You did?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.010
You bet.

08:31.093 --> 08:34.639
-In this precinct?
-Especially this precinct.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.807
I figured if I could do
something with this relic,

08:36.891 --> 08:38.100
I can tackle anything.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.520
Forgive me, Grace,
but I don't seem to be following

08:40.603 --> 08:41.687
what you're telling me.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.732
I'm attached to Central Planning, Frank.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.859
I'm your police decorator.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.861
BATES: Excuse me, Captain.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.949
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a jockstrap
directing traffic down on Dekker Avenue.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.867
Outside our robbery stakeout?

08:54.951 --> 08:58.329
-You got it.
<i>-Condenado! </i>Pick up the scrooge!

08:58.996 --> 09:00.998
He just said to pick the sucker up.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.543
-(giggles)
-(phone rings)

09:03.626 --> 09:05.336
Oh, Frank.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.463
I don't want to be considered

09:07.547 --> 09:11.634
anything other than a normal
working part of this precinct.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.554
-So let's all relax.
-ESTERHAUS: Uh, excuse me.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.972
I just got the call, Francis.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.600
Belker nailed one of the two rapists
in St. James Park.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.644
FURILLO: Oh, let's hope he's the big one.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.771
Just a moment sir.
He'll be right with you.

09:24.355 --> 09:28.150
Uh, Phil Esterhaus, Grace Gardner.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.653
-How do you do?
-Hello.

09:30.736 --> 09:35.241
As a matter of fact,
Phil here will be your liaison.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.452
-I will?
-So, uh...

09:40.204 --> 09:41.747
why not get on with the job?

09:43.541 --> 09:45.668
I'm very glad to meet you, Sergeant.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.380
Good-looking woman.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.632
(inhales) Nice perfume.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.136
-(sighs)
-Ah. Chief Daniels.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.221
(buttons click)

09:58.306 --> 09:59.348
Captain Furillo.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.354
Fine. Thank you, sir.
How are you, Chief?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.817
Oh, <i>marone</i>.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.654
Forty-eight hours.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.866
Yes, sir.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.202
We're leaving right now.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.873
Great news.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.376
The President of the United States...

10:28.336 --> 10:29.545
wants to visit the Hill.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.175
-Belker.
-Bail bonds, sir.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.676
Move it!

10:35.760 --> 10:39.639
Huerta Bail Bonds,
half a block up, across the street.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.141
D-Don't take jail. Make bail.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.976
You stay, I pay.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.812
Oughta do what they do in Sweden.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.191
Freedom for a lousy 10%!

10:58.824 --> 11:01.202
(growling)

11:02.411 --> 11:04.372
(growling)

11:10.252 --> 11:12.755
(growling continues)

11:13.964 --> 11:17.551
(yelling, growling)

11:17.635 --> 11:18.761
(whining)

11:21.138 --> 11:23.140
MAN: Belker, you've met your match.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.227
WOMAN: Way to go! Way to go!

11:26.310 --> 11:30.314
Very refined sense of humor
we got around this place.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.109
Sit!

11:33.776 --> 11:36.237
(officers laughing)

11:38.614 --> 11:40.783
-I was thinking of sliced avocado--
-Mrs. Gardner,

11:40.866 --> 11:43.703
I find it hard to understand
how a department short of funds

11:43.786 --> 11:46.288
can spend precious dollars on ambience.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.166
Ah, never underrate ambience, Sergeant,

11:49.250 --> 11:50.918
particularly in the work environment.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.963
-This is not a community center--
-(laughs) It certainly isn't.

11:54.046 --> 11:57.091
Which is all the more reason
to humanize it, Sergeant.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.552
We can't cover ten grocery stores
at the same time!

11:59.635 --> 12:02.304
I know, I know. Set up a schedule.
Do the best we can.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.808
-Frank, a word with you, if I may.
-Please, Phil, not now.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.851
(phone rings)

12:06.934 --> 12:08.394
-Henry.
-Yeah, Frank? What's up?

12:08.477 --> 12:09.562
Downtown.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.481
Uh, listen, I gotta go.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.317
No, tell her he's just a puppy.
(laughs) Yeah.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.445
No, no, he's college material.
Take my word for it.

12:17.528 --> 12:21.157
-And the cutest little thing.
-(barking, snarling)

12:23.492 --> 12:25.369
You will excuse me, won't you, Grace?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.456
Whatever that is in there, get rid of it.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.666
-Francis...
-No, he's quite spirited, actually.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.709
Henry.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.380
Good collar, Mick.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.133
One outta two ain't good enough, Captain.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.638
I have a hunch you'll correct that.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.807
-Any connection to the 11 others?
-No, not much.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.642
Maybe the interrogation
will turn something,

12:48.726 --> 12:50.102
like the name of his running mate.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.563
You Mirandized him, didn't you?
We don't want to violate any laws.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.774
-Aw, Captain--
-I mean it, Mick. No mistakes.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.152
-I don't wanna lose this animal in court.
-Excuse me, uh...

12:58.652 --> 13:01.489
I'm having stress.
I wanna call my doctor.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.199
I-I'm getting therapy.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.868
-(growls)
-Okay.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.705
FURILLO: We need to get under way.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.084
Sirs? Sirs, y-you're not
leaving me alone with him.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.259
What happens
if the president can't make it

13:22.343 --> 13:23.886
at the last moment? Then what?

13:23.969 --> 13:26.222
I don't see that as your concern.

13:26.305 --> 13:30.059
Your concern is his safety,
should he come.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.978
For a press secretary,
you've got a short memory, Mr. Parker.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.024
If the president doesn't show,
you'll be gone...

13:37.107 --> 13:41.987
and I'll be stuck with the consequences
of 10,000 unmet expectations.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.949
What troubles me here, Captain,

13:45.032 --> 13:47.284
is your perception
of the community up there.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.289
You make it sound like
a loose collection of banana republics.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.958
In a sense, that's right.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.793
Well,

13:56.377 --> 14:00.673
then maybe we should be considering
another community in another city.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.469
Hill Street's exactly what the president
is looking for, Mr. Parker. Believe me.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.179
It's really disgusting up there.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.598
You'll get
some incredibly effective footage.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.142
If you can't deal with it, Frank,

14:12.226 --> 14:14.228
I'll put someone on it who can.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.231
Commander, Mr. Parker...

14:18.858 --> 14:20.401
Captain Furillo...

14:21.193 --> 14:23.112
is the only police officer up there

14:23.195 --> 14:25.489
who's respected by everyone,

14:26.031 --> 14:27.825
including the youth gangs.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.911
All we really have to do
is convene a summit meeting,

14:30.995 --> 14:33.205
tell them the president's coming,
and then...

14:33.289 --> 14:34.456
take it from there.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.043
We can do that easily, Frank-- Captain.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.129
Captain?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.636
We'll do what we can.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.723
We'll do our best.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.642
And I hear your best is mighty good, sir.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.193
Belly up. Thanks a lot, Henry.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.987
I'm sorry. God, am I sorry.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.197
Listen, I couldn't help it. (stammering)

15:07.281 --> 15:10.910
I got this anxiety syndrome
around authority.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.620
I thought I had a handle on it,

15:12.703 --> 15:15.456
but between Commander Swanson
and this Parker guy...

15:15.539 --> 15:17.666
God, he's got cold eyes.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.921
Listen, Frank, I can understand it
if you can't forgive me.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.343
-Come on, Henry. I forgive you.
-No, really--

15:27.426 --> 15:29.803
I mean it. Don't fold on me now.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.639
I need you to go back
and set up that summit.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.932
How could I have said that?

15:33.015 --> 15:35.559
Because it was exactly
what they wanted to hear.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.355
See if you can get 'em all in
for, say, 4:00.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.941
I got a lunch date I'm already late for.
I'll be back right after.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.652
(elevator bell dings)

15:44.735 --> 15:45.694
(shudders)

15:46.195 --> 15:47.488
I think the bone might be--

15:47.571 --> 15:51.909
Oh, I'm sure the bone
is a terrific color for this area.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.287
It'll go with the occasional bloodstain.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.540
All right, Sergeant.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.920
If you have your heart set on waging war,
you got it, baby.

16:03.837 --> 16:07.049
-Hey! Good collar, you guys!
-BOTH: Thank you, Sarge.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.258
You get an assist each.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.220
This entire area is wasted space!

16:11.303 --> 16:13.263
This entire area is ridiculous!

16:14.807 --> 16:17.893
-Hey, look! Bobby's back!
-Hey!

16:17.977 --> 16:20.020
-(applause, whistling)
-Hey!

16:20.104 --> 16:21.897
Hill. We heard about him.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
He was partnered with Renko, wasn't he?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.776
He was sleepwalking', is what I heard.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.612
I wouldn't be so sure
of what you heard, Fuentes.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.739
You guys are new up here,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.367
so let's don't get reckless
with our mouths.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.619
(chattering, laughing)

16:35.703 --> 16:37.913
-Hey, Bobby.
-All right.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.123
Good seeing' you, kid.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.042
Great to have you back, babe. Right on.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.753
Good to have you back. Really.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.506
-Hey, Bobby.
-Hey, Sarge.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.174
How you doing', huh?

16:50.426 --> 16:51.844
I'm doing okay.

16:53.137 --> 16:57.307
-How you doing?
-Well, it's just the same old ambience.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.394
Geez, good to have you back.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.645
You are back, aren't you?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.526
Anytime you say.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.866
So... (sighs)

17:15.117 --> 17:16.785
How's it going' around here?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.747
-How's your new lady?
-Cindy? Wow!

17:19.830 --> 17:21.290
Get this.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.417
Senior class sergeant-at-arms,

17:23.500 --> 17:25.252
chairman of the prom committee,

17:25.335 --> 17:27.254
assistant marching band captain

17:27.337 --> 17:29.882
while maintaining a solid "B" average.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.759
Hey, that sounds great.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.136
(chuckles) Girl's got a big future. Big.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.138
MAN: Excuse me.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.348
You know, Bobby, if, uh...

17:39.892 --> 17:41.685
you ever wanna talk about it...

17:42.978 --> 17:45.272
I've been there myself a time or two.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.863
Thanks, Sarge. I'm doing okay.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.993
Just takes a little time.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.255
MAN: Who's that there?
Is that Bobby over there?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.423
MAN 2: Uh-huh.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.136
(inhales)

18:32.611 --> 18:33.904
When'd you get back?

18:34.822 --> 18:36.156
About a week ago.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.538
-You look skinny.
-Yeah. I gotta get my suit altered.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.874
You preferring that
to the basic blues these days?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.043
I don't know.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.170
Haven't really thought about it yet.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.297
How you doing'?

18:53.715 --> 18:57.219
Look, you didn't come in here
for a bunch of "Hi, how are yous."

18:58.011 --> 18:59.930
-What's on your mind?
-You didn't call.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.932
Five weeks in a hospital bed,
you didn't call.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.725
Belker came by every day.
Even met a nurse.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.061
I figured if you wanted to talk,
you would've called me.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.105
Sounds like you did a lot of figuring',
my friend.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.815
Well, I had a lot of time to.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.486
You were lucky, man.
You were in a coma for two weeks.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.071
Well, not me, Renko.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.034
I never lost consciousness, man,
not for a second.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.580
Lying on that cold floor, man,

19:24.663 --> 19:26.957
I could feel the blood
oozing' out of my body,

19:27.040 --> 19:28.917
but I... I just couldn't move.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.460
I don't wanna hear about this.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.546
Man, the rats--

19:34.214 --> 19:36.466
The rats, Renko,

19:36.550 --> 19:39.553
were crawling' on my face, man.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.099
I prayed to die.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.101
(whistling)

19:46.185 --> 19:48.729
Occupied. Occupied.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.898
Now you listen to me.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.151
The first thing I asked
when I came out of it was,

19:54.234 --> 19:56.195
"Is Bobby still alive?"

19:56.278 --> 19:58.989
They told me yes,
and I figured about a month from now

19:59.072 --> 20:01.575
we'll be back in business.
But you didn't call me. Why?

20:01.658 --> 20:03.785
I figured you blamed me
for us getting' shot.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.245
-Oh, man--
-If I hadn't lost it,

20:05.329 --> 20:06.830
we wouldn't have had to go
into that building.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.125
Hey, man, it happened!
That's all, Renko. It just happened.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.670
I never blamed you, man.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.173
Then why the hell didn't you call?

20:22.137 --> 20:24.514
Oh, man, I don't know. (sighs)

20:25.641 --> 20:26.808
I guess I just figured

20:26.892 --> 20:29.478
things couldn't go back
to the way they were.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.439
Can they?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.399
I don't know.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.985
Something' is different.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.446
Well, hallelujah, cowboy.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.449
I haven't even gotten to "different."

20:44.534 --> 20:47.829
I still gotta get past being scared.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.377
Well, I'm not scared
of anything or anybody, my friend.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.587
People have always been scared of me.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.131
Lying in that hospital bed,

20:58.215 --> 21:01.051
I thought God may have given me
a body like a B-52,

21:01.134 --> 21:03.428
but he also gave me a brain.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.180
(sighs)

21:05.264 --> 21:08.016
We don't need to prove we can
go out there again, Bobby.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.143
That's where it's at for both of us.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.104
If we show 'em we got
something between our ears,

21:12.187 --> 21:13.689
we don't have to be sniper meat.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.732
(door opens)

21:15.816 --> 21:18.694
(chatting outside)

21:20.112 --> 21:22.114
Sorry to bust up your reunion,

21:22.197 --> 21:25.575
but, uh, people are beginning to talk.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.372
Renko?

21:31.331 --> 21:32.708
Have you got a uniform?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.585
Yeah. In my locker. Why?

21:36.503 --> 21:38.463
Well, I'm shorthanded today.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.134
I got a bunch of guys out with the flu,
so if the two of you feel up to it...

21:42.968 --> 21:44.803
Nah, I'm sorry, Sergeant, I...

21:45.429 --> 21:47.139
My leg's still bothering me.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.766
I've been watching you
use that prop for days, young fella.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.184
Who you trying to kid?

21:52.644 --> 21:55.230
Maybe we just don't wanna be together.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.108
Okay. We can work that one out.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.109
In the meantime,

21:59.192 --> 22:02.237
I want you to both use
Levy and Bartlett's unit.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.947
Park detail.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.115
Yeah.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.707
(instrumental music playing)

22:20.756 --> 22:22.174
RENKO: <i>It's very clean, my friend.</i>

22:22.257 --> 22:24.509
-Fluff and fold 'em. That's it.
-Just be quiet.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.220
Everybody out in their own
neat little slot.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.889
Say, listen, Renko.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.683
You wanna go for detective?
That's fine with me, man.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.769
I'll be more than happy
to interview new partners

22:33.852 --> 22:35.479
as soon as we're off this shift.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.106
-You dig?
-Yeah. Loud and clear, my friend.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.358
Loud and clear.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.320
Will you look at this damn uniform.
You coming or what?

22:43.403 --> 22:45.530
-Hold your water, son.
-What'd you say?

22:46.239 --> 22:48.033
-You heard what I said.
-If you don't mind,

22:48.116 --> 22:49.493
my leg's a little stiff.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.870
-You want me to drive?
-No. I can't stand the way you drive.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.872
Fine. Uh-huh.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.085
(chattering)

23:02.506 --> 23:03.715
Excuse me.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.260
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.346
-Uh--
-Couldn't get away.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.806
I've ordered already.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.102
(sighs) I have to be back in court
in half an hour.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.355
Frank, this isn't my idea of progress.

23:19.981 --> 23:20.857
Progress?

23:21.566 --> 23:24.903
Relationships don't mature
on a diet of 20-minute lunches.

23:26.113 --> 23:29.616
I had a meeting this morning
with Randy Parker,

23:29.699 --> 23:33.620
special assistant
to the president of the United States.

23:33.703 --> 23:37.082
What was I supposed to do,
say, "Excuse me,

23:37.165 --> 23:40.043
give the president my regards,
but I got a hot lunch date"?

23:40.669 --> 23:43.547
If it was an isolated situation,
that would be one thing.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.425
-But it isn't.
-Joyce, please.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.386
I've had a terrible morning.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.930
I need a little relief.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.307
Can't we talk about this later?

23:54.391 --> 23:57.352
-When?
-Tonight.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.021
(sighs) No offense, Captain,

24:00.856 --> 24:02.649
but I don't want to fight tonight.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.193
I wanna do other things.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.490
(pager beeping)

24:10.574 --> 24:11.783
Perfect.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.079
(sighs)

24:17.956 --> 24:21.334
(laughs) I don't wanna make
a huge deal about it, Francis,

24:21.418 --> 24:23.920
but the woman's being
disruptive in the extremis,

24:24.004 --> 24:25.380
if you get my drift.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.716
-Humor her, will ya, Phil?
-I'm trying.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.677
But she's all over the place.
It's not very easy.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.930
Uh, I'm on a pay phone, Phil.
What's the scoop?

24:34.598 --> 24:37.017
Well, uh, looks like it's coming together.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.437
Goldblume's in,
and they're trying to convene a summit.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.646
Good. What else?

24:41.730 --> 24:45.984
Oh, uh, Belker's interrogating
the rape suspect.

24:46.067 --> 24:49.029
-Alone?
-<i>No. I put Chesley in with him.</i>

24:49.112 --> 24:51.531
-Also, your wife called.
-Ex-wife.

24:51.615 --> 24:55.160
She called six times.
She sounds a little tense.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.078
Well, if she calls again,
just tell her to--

24:57.162 --> 25:01.875
<i>-(people shouting)</i>
-Phil, what the hell is that? Phil?

25:01.958 --> 25:04.002
-WOMAN: Come on!
-(Belker growling) Put me down!

25:04.085 --> 25:06.463
-(shouting continues)
-ESTERHAUS: Hey, what happened?

25:06.546 --> 25:09.799
-Hey! What happened?
-Get somebody in there fast.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.302
-Get inside with the prisoner!
-Put me down!

25:12.385 --> 25:16.014
-Not till you stop growling.
-Can't you see that I stopped growling?

25:16.097 --> 25:17.891
Look at me, Chesley. I'm limp!

25:18.850 --> 25:20.644
Phil, what's happening?

25:21.895 --> 25:24.314
That pig in there is laughing at us.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.858
And he's laughing at who he raped.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.570
Because he is 17. He's 17! He's walking!

25:31.154 --> 25:34.574
Belker, look. We don't know that for sure.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.536
Mick. Did anyone get bitten?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.705
Oh, no, Sarge.
I didn't lay a tooth on the kid.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.166
Why doesn't anybody
give me credit for that?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.960
-(telephone ringing)
(growling)

25:45.043 --> 25:47.504
-ESTERHAUS: <i>Get him outside!</i>
-Phil, are you there?

25:47.587 --> 25:50.090
-Come on, Mick.
-Walk it off, hell!

25:50.173 --> 25:51.550
I'm going out there,

25:51.633 --> 25:54.094
and I am gonna get the other guy!

25:55.470 --> 25:57.973
If anybody wants me,

25:58.056 --> 25:59.599
<i>I'll be in the park!</i>

26:00.141 --> 26:02.811
-(whispering) Phil, are you there?
-What do you say, my friend?

26:02.894 --> 26:05.605
I'd like to use the phone
before she starts by herself.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.690
Damn.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.149
About time.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.824
I wish you'd talk to her, Joyce.

26:15.907 --> 26:19.119
She's really on the verge
of mutilating something very beautiful

26:19.202 --> 26:20.370
between us.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.831
Oh, uh, Doug Browning, meet Frank Furillo.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.834
-Oh, hi, Frank. Really nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.253
Hiller, Bloomgarden,
Resnick and Smith. Right?

26:28.336 --> 26:30.505
-Beg your pardon?
-You're with their firm, aren't you?

26:30.589 --> 26:33.091
-No.
-Spiegelglass and Ludwig.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.468
-I'm afraid not. Joyce--
-Ah.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.096
Look, I'm really running late.
I've gotta get back to court.

26:38.179 --> 26:40.682
-Judge Nadler.
-You're gonna see Shelley before I will.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.642
Give her this and tell her
it was the best I could do--

26:42.726 --> 26:44.811
Joyce, I really don't think
you ought to take that.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.730
It's just a little nose candy, Frank.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.776
Look, Joyce, we have got to get together.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.112
Frank, uh,

26:54.195 --> 26:55.822
what can I say?

26:59.492 --> 27:01.244
(sighs) How could you?

27:01.328 --> 27:03.204
What? What'd I do?

27:03.288 --> 27:04.789
Embarrass me like that.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.751
I prevented you from committing a felony
is what I did!

27:07.834 --> 27:09.711
-Excuse me.
-What is the matter with you?

27:09.794 --> 27:11.630
The matter is
your automatic cop assumption

27:11.713 --> 27:12.714
that everybody is a felon.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.842
What makes you so sure I'd have taken
that vial of alleged drugs anyway?

27:15.925 --> 27:17.177
I didn't want to take a chance.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.095
Then you should have looked the other way.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.806
I could have arrested that man.
I should have!

27:21.890 --> 27:24.100
We really live
in two different worlds, Frank.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.685
Not so different, counselor.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.438
Need I remind you
we are both officers of the court?

27:28.521 --> 27:30.857
We may both be officers
of the court, Captain,

27:30.940 --> 27:32.984
but at least I am capable
of distinguishing

27:33.068 --> 27:34.527
between my personal life
and my work life.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.445
DRIVER: Say, lady.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.114
-The criminal courts building, please.
-All right!

27:41.034 --> 27:44.454
So after waiting around for six hours,
the assistant D.A. comes out,

27:44.537 --> 27:46.539
looking like he just stepped
in something squishy,

27:46.623 --> 27:50.251
and he tells me they copped the suspect
down to misdemeanor joyriding.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.087
We caught the guy
with two Caddies and a Buick

27:52.170 --> 27:53.505
in the back of a trailer rig.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.715
Now, does that suck lemons,
Bates, or what?

27:55.799 --> 27:56.716
It's the system, man.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.177
Hey. Nothing's wrong with the system.

27:59.260 --> 28:02.013
They're handing down
longer suspended sentences all the time.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.808
(laughs) I mean, the two animals
who jumped this kid...

28:04.891 --> 28:06.935
will probably be back
in the park joy-boying

28:07.018 --> 28:08.978
-somebody else in a couple days.
-Hey, motormouth.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.730
Where's your sensitivity? In your fists?

28:10.814 --> 28:13.775
(moans) Are we taking you
to the hospital, Bates, or what?

28:13.858 --> 28:16.569
I wouldn't ride with you two
to a dogfight.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.364
-Hmm. Hmm!
-No doubt about it.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.491
-She wants me.
-Oh.

28:21.574 --> 28:22.992
(phone ringing)

28:26.538 --> 28:30.834
-(upbeat music playing)
-(dogs barking)

28:30.917 --> 28:34.462
(indistinct chatting)

28:36.256 --> 28:37.257
What do you think?

28:41.344 --> 28:42.887
Let's do it, bro.

28:42.971 --> 28:46.433
-(siren blaring)
-(tires squeaking)

28:49.936 --> 28:53.356
All right. All righty.
What do you guys think you're doing?

28:53.440 --> 28:56.109
-<i>Habla inglés,</i> man?
-<i>No mucho.</i>

28:56.192 --> 28:57.902
Hey, just cool it with the set, <i>amigo.</i>

28:57.986 --> 29:01.197
(murmuring in Spanish)

29:01.281 --> 29:02.657
You speak English, man?

29:03.783 --> 29:05.034
Is this stuff yours?

29:05.785 --> 29:07.912
-Yeah.
-It is, huh? The television set too?

29:07.996 --> 29:10.540
-That's right.
-Well, what about the truck?

29:11.624 --> 29:12.459
It's his.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.920
You wanna check out his license
and registration?

29:16.421 --> 29:18.840
(speaking Spanish)

29:18.923 --> 29:21.301
(responding in Spanish)

29:21.384 --> 29:22.886
Hey, we're not doing nothing, man.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.388
Oh, yeah? Can you prove
that television set is yours?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.807
How in the hell
do you expect me to prove that?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.018
What do you think it's doing
out here on the street?

29:30.101 --> 29:30.935
We're moving.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.146
What, out of this place?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.899
Got no license, no registration.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.485
You got a driver's license?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.408
How do you expect me to read this, man?

29:46.242 --> 29:47.494
This your address here?

29:47.577 --> 29:50.663
It's my old place.
I didn't have time to change the address.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.165
So what we got here is,

29:52.248 --> 29:54.793
you're moving a bunch of stuff
you can't prove is yours

29:54.876 --> 29:57.629
from a place that may or may not be
your legal residence

29:57.712 --> 30:00.256
in a vehicle that he can't prove is his.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.551
(shouting in Spanish)

30:03.635 --> 30:05.303
(man laughing)

30:05.386 --> 30:07.889
(chattering in Spanish)

30:07.972 --> 30:09.557
Maybe we oughta just let this go, huh?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.518
We can't do that, man.
They're in violation.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.561
Hey, it's minor stuff, man.
These guys are okay.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.438
We leave now, we look
like chicken bellies.

30:15.522 --> 30:19.275
-I can live with that, man.
-I can't. Come on.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.031
(horn honking)

30:25.114 --> 30:28.618
-MAN: Hey, cop! Hey, cop!
-(shouting in Spanish)

30:28.701 --> 30:33.206
(speaking Spanish)

30:35.875 --> 30:37.794
Man, we're just trying
to get out of this hole.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.254
Look for yourself.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.257
What the hell are you hassling us for?
Hassle somebody else!

30:42.340 --> 30:45.885
-(baby crying)
-This is it.

30:46.719 --> 30:47.720
Buddy.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.640
Man, they have their families in there.
Come on.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.475
<i>Qué pasa,</i> Fuentes?
They don't do nothing.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.685
Okay.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.734
Listen, we're not gonna cite you this time
for the unregistered vehicle...

31:01.818 --> 31:03.695
or for the mutilated license.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.906
But I want you
to get this stuff out of here.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.409
It constitutes a hazardous situation.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.495
Let's go, bro.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.499
Hey, you know,
my grandmother used to have one of these.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.877
Just like it. (chuckles)

31:18.960 --> 31:22.547
We're gonna be back here in one hour,
so get this crap out of here.

31:22.630 --> 31:25.091
(all shouting in Spanish)

31:38.521 --> 31:41.900
This is no setup, man.
Jamal Worthington's gonna be here.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.485
So is Jorge Ruiz of the Gypsy Boys.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.238
I can't tell you over the phone,
but it's very important.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.490
Diablos, Dragons...
They're all coming in at 4:00.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.618
Yeah, we'll send a car.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.871
Just tell 'em 4:00, Hill Street--
Yes, I'll hold.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.331
Phil, where do we stand?

31:56.414 --> 31:58.541
It's coming together, Francis.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.835
Also, you got a hundred calls here.
Plus, um--

32:00.919 --> 32:03.922
They'll have to wait.
Did you get Jesus Martinez?

32:04.005 --> 32:06.549
Yeah, I left a message
at his answering service.

32:06.633 --> 32:10.762
Answering service?
This kid's got an answering service?

32:10.845 --> 32:13.056
FAY: Which is more
than I can say for you, Frank.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.474
Hello, Fay.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.684
You've been ducking my calls.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.312
I have not been ducking your calls.

32:19.395 --> 32:22.774
Just haven't had a free moment
since I rolled out of bed this morning.

32:22.857 --> 32:25.485
-How have you been?
-Pressed.

32:25.568 --> 32:29.113
I got a $600 past-due bill
for Frank Jr.'s tuition,

32:29.197 --> 32:32.075
and all I've got in the bank is $53.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.661
-I need more money, Frank.
-Who doesn't?

32:34.744 --> 32:37.914
I am trying to make
a good home for your son.

32:37.997 --> 32:41.250
But between what I make
and your lousy alimony,

32:41.334 --> 32:42.961
it just doesn't stretch.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.755
-Frank--
-<i>Buenos días,</i> Ray.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.174
Nice to see you, Mrs. Furillo.

32:48.257 --> 32:51.177
We have a situation at the booking desk
that cannot wait.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.055
You are gonna have to deal
with this situation first,

32:54.138 --> 32:55.598
because I'm not moving!

32:57.558 --> 32:58.851
Handle it, Ray,

33:00.061 --> 33:01.562
whatever it is.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.814
Okay.

33:06.567 --> 33:10.029
Damn it, Fay! Every time you blow in here,
you embarrass the hell out of me!

33:10.113 --> 33:11.948
You think I'm not embarrassed?

33:12.031 --> 33:15.743
Or maybe you think I like having
a container of yogurt every day for lunch

33:15.827 --> 33:18.371
because I can't afford
to go out like a normal person!

33:18.454 --> 33:20.289
Fay, you know how much I make.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.918
You know how much of it you get.
There's not a lot left over.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.462
Frank, I am not negotiating.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.589
I am crying out of desperation!

33:28.673 --> 33:33.177
Did it ever occur to you
to take Frank Jr. out of private school?

33:33.261 --> 33:35.805
You could buy a Mercedes
for what that costs.

33:35.888 --> 33:39.100
Do you want to be the one to tell him
he's gotta go back to public school?

33:39.183 --> 33:41.060
-Sure.
-Don't you dare.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.647
For the first time since our divorce,
Frank Jr. is better.

33:44.731 --> 33:48.026
Not entirely out of the woods,
according to Harvey,

33:48.109 --> 33:49.235
but getting there.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.823
Harvey. Harvey is a...

33:54.949 --> 33:55.867
pill.

33:55.950 --> 33:59.704
-What's wrong, Frank? Jealous?
-I'm eating my heart out.

33:59.787 --> 34:03.207
I know you don't like to think
that I could have a rewarding relationship

34:03.291 --> 34:04.792
with another man, Frank,

34:04.876 --> 34:07.462
but I can and I do.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.424
Rewarding, I might add,

34:11.507 --> 34:13.760
in every sense of the word.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.012
Well, if it's so damned rewarding,

34:16.095 --> 34:19.724
why don't you just rinse out
your panty hose and marry the guy?

34:19.807 --> 34:22.226
Let him carry part of the freight. Okay?

34:23.061 --> 34:25.063
You stink, Frank.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.442
And you're gonna hear from my attorney!

34:30.860 --> 34:33.071
(cops speaking on radio)

34:37.617 --> 34:40.703
Mr. Bergosian. Mr. Bessler. Mr. Argitakos.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.622
Mr. Lao. Good.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.832
Uh, Lapidus.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.001
Mr. Lapidus, I'm Henry Goldblume.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.504
Excuse me, Mr. Lapidus. May I?

34:50.213 --> 34:53.007
We're checking, uh, weapons at the desk.
We all agreed to that.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.885
Thank you very much.
I really appreciate that. Thank you.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.598
(chattering)

35:07.730 --> 35:10.358
All right, okay. Okay!

35:10.441 --> 35:12.318
-(chattering quiets)
-Not everyone's here,

35:12.401 --> 35:15.488
-but we've been waiting long enough.
-(Calletano translates into Spanish)

35:15.571 --> 35:17.490
I know you're wondering what's going on,

35:17.573 --> 35:19.534
whether this is a peace conference
or what.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.454
-(continues translating into Spanish)
-(footsteps descending stairs)

35:23.538 --> 35:25.081
Hey-hey, Marquez!

35:25.164 --> 35:28.084
Morning, Father. What? Huh?

35:28.167 --> 35:31.754
-What you looking at?
-Sit down.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.381
How you doing, Frankie?

35:33.464 --> 35:35.591
Quite a party you got here, Frankie.

35:35.675 --> 35:40.805
Got Blood here, Dragons,
Gypsy Boys over there.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.015
Shamrocks over there.

35:43.099 --> 35:46.352
(speaking Spanish)

35:46.435 --> 35:48.020
Yo, Louie.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.941
Remind me to call my personal physician.

35:52.608 --> 35:56.154
Glad you could make it, Jesus.
We have a table reserved for you.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.781
Thank you, Frankie.
You didn't have to do that.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.034
-MAN: Come on, man.
-(all grumbling, muttering)

36:08.541 --> 36:11.002
Go ahead, Frankie. You can talk now.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.504
Thank you, Jesus.

36:16.757 --> 36:17.758
Okay.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.053
What would you say if I told you

36:21.137 --> 36:24.557
-the president of the United States...
-(translating continues)

36:24.640 --> 36:28.269
intends making a fact-finding tour
of this precinct?

36:28.352 --> 36:31.397
(chattering, murmuring)

36:40.990 --> 36:44.660
(speaking Spanish)

36:45.953 --> 36:47.955
-What did he say?
-He says the president

36:48.039 --> 36:51.042
can't cross Gypsy Boy turf
without a passport.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.461
If he wants us, he's gotta pay.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.213
MAN: Hey, what you say? You for real?

36:55.296 --> 36:59.050
What I'm hearing! This is the president
of the United States!

36:59.133 --> 37:01.636
(all shouting)

37:01.719 --> 37:04.555
MALE COP: Hey, quiet! Quiet!

37:04.639 --> 37:07.475
If everybody will just calm down--

37:07.558 --> 37:09.060
(Calletano shouts in Spanish)

37:09.143 --> 37:12.104
-Let me take a whack at this, Captain.
-Shut up-- Not now!

37:12.188 --> 37:13.773
-Everyone!
-(noise quiets)

37:15.358 --> 37:17.568
All I'm asking is your cooperation

37:17.652 --> 37:20.071
for the two short hours
of the president's visit.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.865
-Two hours, man!
-(Calletano translates into Spanish)

37:22.949 --> 37:25.451
If you can't give me
two hours of coolness,

37:25.534 --> 37:28.246
the president's gonna think
you've got no control over your people.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.664
(all chattering)

37:29.747 --> 37:32.917
And he won't deal with anybody
who's got no control.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.461
-(continues translating into Spanish)
-Why should he?

37:35.544 --> 37:37.338
Where's the percentage in it?

37:37.421 --> 37:40.466
Hey, what's my percentage, Furillo?

37:40.549 --> 37:43.844
The president don't mean
diddly-squat up here, man.

37:43.928 --> 37:47.181
-(chattering, laughing)
-I'd like to address that remark, Captain.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.766
Hold it, Parker. No percentages.

37:48.849 --> 37:52.937
The only deal
is a fair shake from this precinct.

37:54.397 --> 37:57.275
For two years
we've played straight pool with you.

37:57.358 --> 38:01.529
No dirty busts,
no railroading, no backroom games.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.948
Nobody wants to go back to the way it was.

38:04.031 --> 38:07.410
-(translating)
-Mr.-- Mr. Furillo, sir?

38:07.493 --> 38:10.329
-Can I ask you a question?
-Go ahead.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.455
Thanks.

38:12.581 --> 38:13.541
Hold that.

38:14.834 --> 38:18.045
Now, suppose Mr. Prez...

38:18.129 --> 38:22.925
decides he wants to go from, let's say,
Blood turf to, uh, Shamrock turf.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.343
How's he gonna do that?

38:24.427 --> 38:26.429
Well, okay.

38:27.263 --> 38:30.016
The "prez" is planning
a walking tour, son,

38:30.099 --> 38:32.601
so... he'll probably walk.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.812
(chattering, laughing)

38:34.895 --> 38:37.356
I guess this guy
is probably a comedian too.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.775
-We got no treaty with them.
-MAN: For real?

38:39.859 --> 38:41.986
No way he's gonna get
from their turf to our turf.

38:42.069 --> 38:44.238
Impossible. We got no treaty.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.575
All right. No problem.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.327
Soon as this meeting breaks up,

38:49.869 --> 38:52.997
you, Detective Goldblume
and the warlord of the Bloods...

38:53.080 --> 38:56.667
can get together
and start hashing out something temporary.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.087
-Use the interrogation room.
-JESUS: You know where that is, huh, bro?

39:00.171 --> 39:02.131
You left your cooties stuck on the chair.

39:02.214 --> 39:06.010
Ooh! I wouldn't take that!
I dig your bow tie!

39:06.093 --> 39:08.596
-Hey, just cool it, man.
-FURILLO: All right. Anybody else?

39:08.679 --> 39:11.307
Yeah, listen,
what's the sugar for us, huh?

39:11.390 --> 39:12.475
-Sugar?

39:12.558 --> 39:15.227
Yeah. I mean, if the president is coming,

39:15.311 --> 39:17.271
there's gonna be TV.

39:17.355 --> 39:21.525
And everybody knows
there's a lot of gold in television, man.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.943
<i>Dinero</i>, huh?

39:23.569 --> 39:25.905
Okay, okay. Listen, guys.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.323
I'm not gonna lie to you.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.409
There's gonna be TV cameras
all over the place.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.370
After all, it's a media event.

39:33.037 --> 39:36.582
But it's a news event.
Nobody gets paid for being on the news.

39:36.665 --> 39:40.753
Al Pacino don't work for nothing, man.
Huh? That's right.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.421
(scattered applause, chattering)

39:42.505 --> 39:44.882
Get him. He thinks he's Al Pacino.

39:44.965 --> 39:48.636
-(Calletano translating into Spanish)
-(laughing)

39:48.719 --> 39:51.347
The only thing you ever autographed
was a confession.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.891
(murmuring, laughing)

39:53.974 --> 39:57.728
At least I can write,
which makes me unique in this room.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.356
-What you said!
-I dig your bow tie!

40:00.439 --> 40:03.234
-Right!
-(noise quiets)

40:03.317 --> 40:04.193
All right.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.905
Any beefs between now and then,
you run 'em through the station.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.657
(translation continues)

40:10.157 --> 40:12.159
That's it. That's all.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.203
-Be cool.
-Be cool.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.248
Uh, Captain, if I could say
just a few words here--

40:17.331 --> 40:19.125
It's cool, Parker. Leave 'em be.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.085
Easy, Captain.

40:21.168 --> 40:24.797
Guys, I just wanted to express,
on behalf of the president,

40:24.880 --> 40:26.924
his appreciation.

40:27.007 --> 40:29.927
Now, he wouldn't be coming up here
if he didn't care,

40:30.553 --> 40:32.763
if he wasn't on your side.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.682
-(all murmuring)
-You believe this guy?

40:36.475 --> 40:38.018
So, thanks, you guys, and...

40:38.602 --> 40:41.188
-MAN: He's gotta be in the government.
-...stay cool.

40:41.272 --> 40:45.359
(clucking) You believe this guy? (clucks)

40:45.443 --> 40:48.070
(laughing, chattering)

40:48.154 --> 40:49.864
Had to get into it, didn't you?

40:49.947 --> 40:51.282
I warned you, Parker,

40:51.365 --> 40:54.118
they may be a lot of things,
but they're not stupid,

40:54.201 --> 40:55.578
and they don't forget.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.329
Yo, Furillo!

41:01.542 --> 41:04.837
You're really learning
the business well, Frankie.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.422
Hey, Mr. G-man.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.383
How 'bout those jobs and social programs?

41:09.467 --> 41:12.720
Diablo don't need that garbage.

41:13.512 --> 41:18.267
What we do need is a picture of the dude
with his arms around my mother's shoulder.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.060
(scattered jeering, chattering)

41:20.561 --> 41:22.271
She's got cancer really bad.

41:22.354 --> 41:25.149
-My daddy has a hangnail!
-Shh!

41:25.232 --> 41:27.359
Before you run off at the mouth, Parker,

41:27.443 --> 41:30.237
if his mother gets a picture
with the president,

41:30.321 --> 41:31.906
they're all gonna want pictures,

41:31.989 --> 41:35.576
and if they don't have mothers,
there'll be girlfriends and cousins.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.994
I'm sorry, man.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.288
And I'm sorry about your mother.
I didn't know.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.248
<i>Así es la vida,</i> bro.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.460
As for you, Mr. G-man,

41:45.085 --> 41:47.838
if you send out any social program checks,

41:47.922 --> 41:49.507
you send 'em to me.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.800
On Diablos turf,

41:52.551 --> 41:54.386
I'm the government.

41:55.596 --> 41:59.808
-(all murmuring)
-MAN: Ooh! Jesus!

41:59.892 --> 42:01.393
Hmm! Tell him!

42:01.477 --> 42:03.187
-MAN 2: That's right.
-Louie.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.064
MAN 3: All right.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.568
-Stay cool, Frankie.
-MAN: Ow! Ahh!

42:09.652 --> 42:12.446
-(chattering)
-(Goldblume speaking, indistinct)

42:18.619 --> 42:21.163
If you guys wanna caucus today--

42:21.247 --> 42:23.415
Francis, can I have
a word with you upstairs?

42:23.499 --> 42:24.917
What's going on in there, Phil?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.670
Take it from me. You don't want to know.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.714
Phil, show Mr. Parker out, will you?

42:31.840 --> 42:34.343
Mr. Parker, you know where
the stairs are. Hmm?

42:35.928 --> 42:38.013
MAN: Okay, let's... Let's go.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.723
Get outta my way, man.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.642
Get out of my way.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.562
(officers murmuring)

42:44.645 --> 42:47.314
(door closes)

42:48.440 --> 42:49.817
(sighs)

42:53.862 --> 42:55.364
What's going on?

43:06.041 --> 43:07.543
What's this, Sneed?

43:13.340 --> 43:14.675
A baseball bat, Captain.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.052
Oh. You in a league or something?

43:20.389 --> 43:21.557
Gentlemen,

43:22.516 --> 43:24.768
I've been a cop 17 years,

43:25.561 --> 43:28.230
and I've been to a few
softball games myself.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.983
So what say? Let's not kid a kidder.

43:36.655 --> 43:38.324
(slams on locker)

43:39.033 --> 43:40.409
Who called practice?

43:42.328 --> 43:44.413
-I did, Captain.
-We both did, sir.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.375
You both look like you already lost.
What happened?

43:49.543 --> 43:50.669
We got jumped.

43:50.753 --> 43:54.423
Jumped? Just like that?
In broad daylight?

43:54.506 --> 43:55.799
We were in a building, sir.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.385
We were investigating
a possible burglary in progress.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.345
And?

43:59.845 --> 44:02.139
And when it turned out
to be a false alarm,

44:02.222 --> 44:04.975
when we tried to leave,
that's when they jumped us.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.061
They got our guns.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.608
Well, listen up, athletes.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.070
Softball practice is canceled.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.405
You're gonna let 'em get away with it?

44:18.489 --> 44:20.240
What if one of those guns kills a cop?

44:20.324 --> 44:22.201
Harris, there are enough guns out there

44:22.284 --> 44:24.620
to kill every one of us
a dozen times over!

44:24.703 --> 44:27.790
I don't give a rat's bladder
about your guns!

44:27.873 --> 44:30.918
What I do care about,
and what scares the hell out of me,

44:31.001 --> 44:33.879
is the kind of morality I'm seeing here.

44:33.962 --> 44:37.883
Francis, there's another
aspect to this... pride.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.009
Professional pride.

44:39.093 --> 44:43.180
That's why the men wanted to handle this,
uh, informally, so to speak.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.349
Well, if this is how you show your pride,

44:45.432 --> 44:48.477
then turn in your blues
and get the hell out of my precinct.

44:49.061 --> 44:52.564
What we're supposed to be here
is the one thing people can trust.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.317
If you go out there
like a bunch of night riders,

44:55.401 --> 44:58.362
what the hell are you
but just another vicious street gang?

45:03.909 --> 45:06.036
(exhales)

45:07.037 --> 45:08.622
Um,

45:08.706 --> 45:12.292
let's accede to the captain's wishes
on this one, huh?

45:12.376 --> 45:13.502
Shall we?

45:16.588 --> 45:18.799
-(locker doors slamming)
-MAN: Rained out.

45:20.926 --> 45:23.011
(chattering)

45:26.181 --> 45:28.350
Thought maybe I could see you tonight.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.227
Not tonight, Frank.

45:30.769 --> 45:32.187
I've got a ton of homework.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.482
I'm in appeals court
in the morning at 8:00 a.m.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.901
I'm sorry about today.

45:38.610 --> 45:39.778
So am I.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.199
No. No, I'm not.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.118
Look, uh...

45:48.579 --> 45:51.331
Frank, the longer I see you,

45:52.791 --> 45:54.376
<i>it's gotten more complicated</i>

45:54.460 --> 45:57.588
than I think either of us
expected or wants.

45:58.380 --> 45:59.673
I know what I want.

46:01.383 --> 46:02.968
I think we both do.

46:04.553 --> 46:07.431
You always make it sound so easy,
don't you, pizza man?

46:07.514 --> 46:09.057
<i>I'll come by.</i>

46:09.141 --> 46:11.727
We fight better in the flesh.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.774
Let me see you for breakfast.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.151
<i>Is 6:00 a.m. too early?</i>

46:20.235 --> 46:22.321
Do I call you or nudge you?

46:22.404 --> 46:23.614
You call.

46:25.282 --> 46:27.534
This is an all-nighter, Frank. Really.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.120
It's funny. I had the same thing in mind.

46:33.290 --> 46:35.709
I really care for you, Counselor.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.169
Me too, Captain.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.048
Good night.

46:42.758 --> 46:43.884
Good night.

47:03.821 --> 47:04.947
Francis.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.615
Yeah, Phil?

47:08.450 --> 47:12.913
I, uh, might have caused us
a little grief with Division.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.249
What kind of grief?

47:16.792 --> 47:19.086
I had to throw that decorator woman out.

47:19.169 --> 47:21.004
It was either that or commit a felony.

47:23.674 --> 47:24.800
It's okay.

47:25.634 --> 47:27.970
-I'll take care of it.
-Thanks.

47:28.053 --> 47:30.097
-Good night.
-Night, Phil.

47:32.307 --> 47:34.768
-(snickers)
-Belker.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.980
(phone rings)

47:39.189 --> 47:41.817
-MAN: Belker brought him in...
-Move it!

47:41.900 --> 47:44.194
-MAN 2: Wonder if it's the guy.
-MAN: And no bites.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.239
MAN 2: Yeah. Wonder if it's the guy.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.741
MAN: All right! All right, Mick!

47:49.825 --> 47:51.869
WOMAN: Way to go!

47:51.952 --> 47:54.162
Would you like to sit down
over there, hair ball?

47:54.246 --> 47:56.415
Or would you prefer internal bleeding?

47:57.583 --> 47:58.584
Captain.

48:00.085 --> 48:01.837
The other rapist from this morning.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.797
And this one's no minor.

48:05.507 --> 48:06.884
You're something else, Belker.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.469
I mean that.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.556
Thank you, Captain.

48:13.348 --> 48:16.977
(instrumental music playing)

48:24.359 --> 48:26.612
(thunder rumbling)

48:34.912 --> 48:37.497
(no audible dialogue)

48:54.264 --> 48:56.516
(music plays)
