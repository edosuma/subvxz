WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:11.343
What the fuck?

00:11.386 --> 00:12.905
<i>I'm telling you, it was crazy.</i>

00:12.929 --> 00:14.865
<i>We knock, you know,
to make sure no one's left in the house.</i>

00:14.889 --> 00:17.529
I'm thinking maybe he lives
with his mother or something like that.

00:17.559 --> 00:21.062
And who opens the door
but Chris McCarthy himself.

00:21.146 --> 00:21.980
What did you do?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.903
You should've seen her, Duvall,
balls of steel.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.459
Had a cover story right there
in her back pocket.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.563
Well, ten years undercover,
you learn to be prepared.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.864
So, who was I following,
and whose DNA are we holding here?

00:30.947 --> 00:33.575
<i>Curtis McCarthy,
Chris McCarthy's brother.</i>

00:33.658 --> 00:34.784
<i>They live together.</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:39.205
Take that mug over to CBI
and request a rush.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.624
Tell them to call my cell the second
they get the results,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.626
I don't care what time it is.
So, we get a guy

00:43.710 --> 00:46.337
who meets the same physical description,
same address,

00:46.421 --> 00:47.964
so access to the same vehicle...

00:48.048 --> 00:51.259
Yeah, we just went from having
one suspect to having two.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:00.185 --> 01:02.729
Curtis McCarthy,
date of birth, February 3rd, 1981.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.897
Thirty years old,
five-eleven, blond hair, blue eyes.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.251
I know what he looks like,
I just spent an hour staring at him.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.155
Colorado driver's license,
clean driving record.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.130
No arrests, no citations,
not even a parking ticket.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.594
We need every detail about this guy.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.842
What he does, where he's been,
what languages he speaks.

01:14.866 --> 01:15.992
Is he former military?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.262
Does he have a birthmark
on his lower left calf?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.286
Leonard! Nunez!

01:20.330 --> 01:22.749
Yeah, Detective Rasmussen
for ADA Gonzalez.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.291
Shit.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.419
Excuse me, sorry.
How long will he be in court?

01:26.961 --> 01:27.962
- Fuck.
- Detective?

01:28.046 --> 01:30.691
Yeah. The house you were on yesterday?
We now know the guy who lives there

01:30.715 --> 01:32.395
has a brother who's also become a suspect.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.613
Christopher McCarthy and Curtis McCarthy.
Hang on, I'll get you their information.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.615
We need a car on each of them,
so you gotta split up.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.639
- Copy that.
- If either so much as blows his nose,

01:39.682 --> 01:42.411
Detective Duvall and I need to be notified
right away. I'm on my cell.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.635
You got it, Detective.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.020
Here you go.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.983
I ran the plates on the girlfriend's car.
It's registered to a Tara Hatfield.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.069
4550 South Alameda, Lakewood.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.196
I want simultaneous timelines
for both brothers

01:53.279 --> 01:55.073
and the girlfriend on all our dates.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.408
And have Selig call me
the second he hands that mug over.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.869
I want a firm ETA
on when I can see the results.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.497
Don't we need Christopher's DNA now too?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.166
No, remember? Y-STRs are identical
for all males in one family.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.002
So, for this test, their DNA's the same.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.373
You have to press the button.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.417
It tells them you're here.

03:18.990 --> 03:19.990
Marie?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.744
Hi, I'm Dara. Come on back.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.959
Oh, you're drenched.
Let me get you something to dry off with.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.377
Oh, that's okay.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.514
Here you go.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.435
Okay.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.275
- Those are for the court, huh?
- Yeah.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.152
Good.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.821
That's exactly what my file needs,
more paperwork.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.741
Well, for what it's worth,

04:01.824 --> 04:05.620
I've seen quite a few
court-mandated clients before.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.208
So, I... I know how awkward
this can be at first.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.085
Not for me.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.127
No?

04:14.712 --> 04:15.880
Well, that's good.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.218
I think it would be for me.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.639
Being forced to go
and see someone like me, a total stranger.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.433
You think I've never seen
somebody like you before?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.271
I've been in the system since I was three.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.985
I've seen social workers, DCFS reps,
foster care placement officers.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.195
And they all say
that they wanna help me...

04:39.988 --> 04:41.239
but I don't need help.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.534
I just need bad things to stop happening.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.619
Well...

04:48.329 --> 04:51.666
I can't stop bad things from happening.
That's above my pay grade.

04:51.749 --> 04:55.878
What I can do is try to help you frame
those bad things a little differently.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.425
Maybe help you see them
through a different lens, so they don't...

05:00.508 --> 05:02.427
We don't have to talk, right?

05:03.761 --> 05:05.361
We just have to sit here for 50 minutes.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.097
That's right.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.643
Okay then.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.174
<i>Curtis McCarthy
served in the Marines, 3rd Division,</i>

05:41.257 --> 05:43.384
<i>from 2000 to 2003.</i>

05:43.468 --> 05:45.678
<i>Honorable discharge, 2004.</i>

05:45.762 --> 05:47.930
DOD says he was stationed in Okinawa.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.684
Which means he probably speaks
multiple languages too.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.812
<i>Christopher also served
in the Marines.</i>

05:54.896 --> 05:56.564
<i>He was based in South Korea.</i>

05:56.647 --> 05:58.691
<i>Honorable discharge, 2002.</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:02.653
<i>So right now, as far as we know,</i>

06:03.363 --> 06:07.825
<i>the only difference between Chris McCarthy
and Curtis McCarthy...</i>

06:09.285 --> 06:12.497
is two years and maybe 20 pounds.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.584
<i>So, it could be one perpetrator
or the other or both together.</i>

06:16.667 --> 06:18.854
Technically, yes,
but our victims only describe one man,

06:18.878 --> 06:20.638
and my gut says
it's the same guy every time.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.758
Well, don't dismiss the family tag-team.
I've seen it before more than once.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.385
Father-son, fraternal twins.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.908
Yeah, but this guy's MO is singular.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.138
He's so consistent
it's almost ritualistic.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.556
And to me, that says one person.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.910
Well, the good news is if we get
a decent enough sample off the mug,

06:32.934 --> 06:34.644
it's not gonna matter
which McCarthy it is.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.997
They live together, so we get a warrant
for the house either way.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.249
But just to be clear,
my job just got about ten times harder.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.983
- How's that?
- Two nearly identical men,

06:41.067 --> 06:43.587
both with DNA that matches samples
you got from the crime scene.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.171
It's like handing a defense lawyer
reasonable doubt on a platter.

06:46.197 --> 06:49.117
Well, one of 'em does have
a giant egg-shaped birthmark on his calf

06:49.200 --> 06:51.512
- that one of our victims can ID.
- Not as helpful as you think.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.889
Eyewitness accounts from trauma victims
might not be convincing enough

06:53.913 --> 06:56.600
to close the window of doubt that
the interchangeable DNA's gonna open up.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.186
Let's hope the DNA gets us in the house,
and the house tells us who did what.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.211
Let's hope.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.023
Curtis has been doing appliance repair
since early 2010.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.151
No time off, no vacations.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.987
Not much online
beyond boilerplate Facebook.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.239
No porn sites registered under his name.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.159
Nothing that raises any red flags.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.451
Hmm.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.746
Okay, I think that's it. Uh, yeah, okay.

07:37.498 --> 07:41.544
So, I went over social media feeds
for Curtis and Tara.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.173
I also checked LPR hits of both
the Toyota and the Mazda.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.841
I have two timelines:

07:47.091 --> 07:49.802
one for Christopher
and one for Curtis and Tara.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.432
April 22nd, the day Sarah was raped,

07:54.849 --> 07:57.268
Curtis and Tara were in Carson City.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.145
I have four LPR hits of her car

07:59.228 --> 08:02.064
and a time stamp picture of him
from Facebook.

08:02.315 --> 08:08.571
On November 14th, 2009,
and then on May 3rd, 2010...

08:09.363 --> 08:12.950
Curtis and Tara were visiting her parents
in Lake Tahoe.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.370
Uh, Facebook again. Tara's a big poster.

08:16.454 --> 08:20.041
Now, no hits on the Mazda
on either of these dates,

08:20.583 --> 08:23.085
but we have it in the area
shortly before and after.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.756
So, basically, Curtis is alibied
for Doris, Lilly, and Sarah.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.008
Feeling more and more like a one-man job.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.092
Yes, it is.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.261
I got a few more LPR hits
of Christopher's Mazda,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.264
but one was kinda interesting.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.475
April 22nd.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.645
We know he left Sarah's apartment by 6:50,

08:40.727 --> 08:42.188
that's when she called 911.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.815
Two hours later, at 8:49,

08:44.899 --> 08:48.319
there's an LPR hit of Christopher's Mazda
at the Lakewood DMV.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.820
I checked with DMV records.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.240
He went there to get
a replacement driver's license.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.784
What is he doing?
Running through his to-do list?

08:54.867 --> 08:57.161
Rape a woman, renew your driver's license.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.497
Come on. What'd he do next? Pick up milk?

09:04.961 --> 09:05.961
What?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.091
This assault...

09:11.175 --> 09:13.094
it's an event for this guy.

09:14.470 --> 09:18.182
He's been planning
and fantasizing about it,

09:19.016 --> 09:20.268
and now he's done it.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.479
And he's gotten away with it.
His adrenaline's pumping.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.940
He feels superhuman.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.780
Why would he kill that buzz
by goin' to the DMV?

09:35.866 --> 09:38.286
He must have needed
a license for something.

09:38.369 --> 09:42.915
Maybe he was planning to leave town?
You need a valid license to board a plane.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.418
Yeah, but he didn't leave, he stayed.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.424
You need a license to buy a gun.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.348
Put these on the list
for the warrant: zippered backpack,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.309
<i>water bottle, wet wipes,</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:04.228
<i>nightgown with blue and yellow
floral pattern,</i>

10:04.687 --> 10:06.856
<i>black Adidas sneakers with white stripes,</i>

10:06.939 --> 10:11.027
<i>Under Armour gloves,
thigh-high nylons or stockings,</i>

10:11.110 --> 10:15.031
<i>black silk-like bindings,
items of string, twine</i>

10:15.114 --> 10:17.700
<i>or other materials that could be used
as a ligature,</i>

10:18.409 --> 10:20.870
<i>vibrator, sexual lubricant,</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:22.413
women's underpants,

10:23.414 --> 10:25.249
pink Cyber-shot camera.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.711
Got it. April 22nd, Slope West Firearms,

10:28.794 --> 10:32.173
a Ruger 357
was sold to Christopher McCarthy

10:32.256 --> 10:35.134
for $328.13.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.057
Ruger 357.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.485
Hey. Don't you have a couple of kids
waiting to be tucked in?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.696
Sitter already got them to sleep.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.993
I knew this was something...

11:43.828 --> 11:45.788
and I should have followed it harder.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.457
Oh, that's what time this is.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.836
Self-flagellation o'clock.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.297
I had a feeling...

11:56.757 --> 11:58.300
and I didn't listen to it.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.178
It's always a mistake.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.891
So, listen...

12:07.143 --> 12:08.978
I know you're not asking for advice.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.522
And by saying this
I'm not saying I know more than you,

12:11.605 --> 12:12.857
it's just, uh...

12:14.108 --> 12:18.028
just an observation having been at this
a lot longer than you have.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.747
Yeah, the work's important.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.542
But if you let it be
the most important thing in your life...

12:32.626 --> 12:34.545
you're gonna find yourself in trouble.

12:38.632 --> 12:42.803
I know in the thick of things
it can feel unnatural to step away,

12:42.887 --> 12:44.346
but it's a survival skill.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.057
Doesn't make you a bad cop.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.772
I'm the kind of person who stays
'til the end of the party.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.941
It may not be healthy,

12:56.025 --> 12:57.485
but it's how I do the job.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.052
- What?
- What? Nothing, it's Gin.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.804
I'm just waiting for you to draw a card.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.698
My first year on the job...

13:46.617 --> 13:50.663
I got called out to a domestic disturbance
in Englewood.

13:51.747 --> 13:56.043
Nice little Tudor house
where the husband had just...

13:57.837 --> 13:59.296
beat the lights out of his wife.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.716
There's blood gushing from her nose,

14:03.717 --> 14:05.344
and her eye's swollen shut.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.680
So, we arrested the guy,

14:08.013 --> 14:10.432
and I tried to send the woman
to the hospital,

14:11.225 --> 14:12.476
but she wouldn't go.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.855
So, the paramedics patched her up...

14:18.482 --> 14:19.608
and then we left.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.779
And it didn't feel right...

14:24.655 --> 14:28.200
so I made a mental note to go back later
and check on her.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.160
So...

14:32.663 --> 14:37.084
I finish my shift,
and I head back to the station...

14:39.461 --> 14:42.089
and all the guys
are wantin' me to go out for a beer.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.260
And I tried saying no,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.304
but you know how that goes.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.805
It's, "Come on, Duvall,

14:50.556 --> 14:53.058
don't be a lame-ass." All that nonsense.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.104
So, I caved.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.231
I went.

15:02.651 --> 15:03.903
I was a good sport.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.240
And guess what?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.995
While I was out having my beer
with the fellas,

15:13.370 --> 15:16.081
the guy made bail,
and he went back home...

15:17.291 --> 15:18.918
and he finished what he started.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.965
He shattered her leg,
and he fractured her skull.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.135
And he left her
with permanent brain damage.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.686
So, when I hear that little voice
inside me saying,

15:39.813 --> 15:40.940
"don't go home yet"...

15:45.486 --> 15:46.570
I pay attention.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.286
We think we have McCarthy...

15:56.664 --> 15:58.290
and it looks like we have him...

16:00.626 --> 16:02.294
but you know as well as I do...

16:04.380 --> 16:07.758
a million things can go wrong
between where we are now...

16:08.592 --> 16:09.885
and where we wanna be.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.444
Anyway, Gin.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.865
Well, fuck me.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.285
One more.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.664
Uh, nah. My little voice is saying
if I go home now,

16:38.747 --> 16:40.916
I can maybe get six hours of sleep.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.885
At least eat something.

16:51.969 --> 16:52.969
Yeah.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.931
Coffee is not a food group.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.018
Yes, ma'am.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.548
How much time do we have left?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.133
About a half hour.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.389
We could just talk about books
or movies or whatever.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.308
Might make the time go faster.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.144
Have you seen anything good on TV lately?

17:42.686 --> 17:43.687
Or the movies?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.814
It doesn't feel like there's anything out
right now.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.608
I just saw <i>Zombieland.</i>

17:47.900 --> 17:48.900
Yeah?

17:50.319 --> 17:51.320
What's it about?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.280
Zombies.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.575
Okay, I have a confession.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.245
I don't actually know what a zombie is.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.163
Seriously?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.875
Not in a clinical sense, no.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.503
Well, a zombie is a walking corpse

18:07.586 --> 18:10.756
with an unstoppable appetite
for human flesh.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.048
Okay.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.051
So, what's the movie about?

18:18.013 --> 18:19.013
Well...

18:20.557 --> 18:24.561
there's this virus that turned
everybody in the world into zombies

18:24.645 --> 18:26.063
except for a few people.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.067
And they're trying to get to LA
because it's safer there, but...

18:30.901 --> 18:33.821
basically, they're just killing
a bunch of zombies

18:33.904 --> 18:35.364
so that the zombies won't kill them.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.491
How do you kill a zombie?

18:37.574 --> 18:40.953
You have to cut their head off
or bash their brains in.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.413
And you can't just, like,
kill a zombie by shooting it.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.875
You have to sever the connection
between its brain and the spinal cord.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.959
Interesting.

18:48.585 --> 18:52.631
So, it's a zombie apocalypse,
and there's a handful of survivors...

18:52.714 --> 18:54.174
And there's Columbus.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.427
Well, the survivors are actually named
after the cities they're from.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.890
So, he meets up with Tallahassee,
who has a thing for Twinkies,

19:02.349 --> 19:04.434
and they meet these two sisters.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.645
Hold on, I have a few questions.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.688
Okay.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.568
Why did these people survive
if everyone else died?

19:13.193 --> 19:17.281
Are there certain qualities you need
to survive a zombie apocalypse?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.992
Just wondering what my odds would be.

19:20.075 --> 19:24.872
Well, yeah, you have to be smart
and brave and strong-willed.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.289
Okay.

19:26.623 --> 19:30.335
And you have to be careful
of who you can trust.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.171
Why's that?

19:32.254 --> 19:36.925
Because the danger in a zombie apocalypse
is actually the people.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.762
Because, yeah, the zombies are gonna
kill you, but they can't help it.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.807
They're just trying to satisfy
their hunger for human flesh.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.934
But the people...

19:47.519 --> 19:51.398
they'll just take advantage
when things go haywire,

19:51.481 --> 19:53.567
and they'll just take advantage
of the chaos.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.571
And they start doing, like,
fucked-up things to each other.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.993
But they don't have an excuse.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.745
They know better.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.831
Well, they should anyway.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.753
And is that inevitable?

20:14.338 --> 20:19.051
That the humans end up turning on
each other and becoming untrustworthy?

20:21.762 --> 20:22.762
Yeah.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.933
Well, I don't know, maybe... maybe not.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.811
Maybe some stay decent,
but you never hear about them.

20:33.690 --> 20:39.613
So, in order to survive you have to assume
everyone else is an enemy.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.074
Yeah.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.620
And the only person
you can really trust is yourself.

20:49.039 --> 20:49.873
Yeah.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.060
Because even if someone says
they have your back,

20:52.084 --> 20:55.837
even if they say
they're gonna protect you...

20:56.880 --> 20:57.923
They won't.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.051
They won't.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.265
You're on your own.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.010
Duvall.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.562
There are two ways out of the house
on Harcourt Street.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.355
Hines and Torres will take the back door,

21:55.439 --> 21:57.524
O'Malley and Rieger, stay on the street.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.985
Morris and Selig,
you'll take the front with me.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.446
Bravo team will park
both east and west of the building

22:02.529 --> 22:04.966
on Alameda where Curtis is staying.
There's only one entrance.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.659
We know Chris McCarthy recently purchased
a 357 Ruger.

22:08.076 --> 22:11.621
Both suspects have military training.
You should assume both will be armed.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.414
Detective.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.082
Thank you.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.922
Here you go.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.299
Oh, no. I'm good, thanks.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.968
You're not goin' in without a vest.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.721
Oh, I'm not going in, period.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.348
What?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.434
Yeah, I don't do arrests.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.814
What do you mean you don't... do them?
It's the job.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.693
So is this. Thirty open cases
that I've ignored for the last month.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.948
McCarthy's done. There's a whole team
of well-trained cops bringing him in.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.784
These people, all they got is me.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.246
You're serious?

22:54.331 --> 22:56.583
Yeah.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.813
Police! Search warrant! Open the door!

24:26.506 --> 24:28.133
Police! Open the door!

24:37.267 --> 24:38.727
Step outside, now!

24:40.937 --> 24:43.624
We have a warrant
to search your house. Anyone else inside?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.368
- No.
- Get your hands on your head.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.766
Christopher McCarthy, you are under arrest
for multiple counts of burglary

25:17.849 --> 25:20.060
and sexual assault.
You have the right to remain silent.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.854
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.548
You have the right to an attorney.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.286
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.962
With these rights in mind,
are you still willing to talk with me

25:30.028 --> 25:31.279
about the charges against you?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.614
No, I want a lawyer.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.012
I want this guy processed
from head to toe.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.959
Curtis McCarthy.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.419
What?

26:27.502 --> 26:28.878
Hands on your head, please.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.214
- What?
- Interlock your fingers.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.984
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Spread your feet.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.193
- Wider.
- What is this?

26:34.217 --> 26:36.279
Hey, man, get your hands off me.
Wha... what is this?

26:36.303 --> 26:38.430
- We need you to come down to the station.
- Why?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.932
What is this? I didn't do anything!

26:41.016 --> 26:43.286
We'll answer your questions
down at the station. Let's go.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.788
I'm not going in there until you tell me
what the hell is going on.

26:45.812 --> 26:49.232
You can make this easy, or if you resist,
we cuff you, and you have a very long day.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.525
I didn't do anything.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.273
All right, everybody clear
on what we're looking for?

27:12.297 --> 27:13.548
Yes, sir.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.478
Take off your clothes.

30:01.674 --> 30:02.717
All of them.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.446
I'm gonna collect reference samples
from you pursuant to the search warrant.

30:23.738 --> 30:24.906
I need a buccal swab.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
Open your mouth.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.634
I need 20 to 25 hairs with roots.
Head hair.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.395
Arm hair.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.119
Pubic hair.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.766
Hey, they're, uh,
wrapping up downstairs.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.790
Okay.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.048
Did you see a guitar anywhere?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.718
Uh, no.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.992
Harrison, would you join us up here,
please?

33:18.204 --> 33:19.205
Get this.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.178
Again, please.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.692
Trophies.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.076
And again, please.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.402
I'll load these hard drives in over
at Golden and start in on 'em right away.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.469
Great, thanks.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.493
How much time do we have?

34:39.368 --> 34:40.411
About eight minutes.

34:41.286 --> 34:42.413
But we can stop.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.831
I just...
I just have to get you to sign this.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.172
So, you're not even curious?

34:51.839 --> 34:54.342
- About what?
- About, like, why I'm here.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.804
The lying thing.
Like, why I'd do that, or...

34:59.388 --> 35:01.224
why I'd make something like that up.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.685
I'm curious about you, Marie,

35:05.144 --> 35:06.020
who you are.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.563
That's not what I asked.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.150
Here's what I think.

35:14.362 --> 35:18.866
No one makes up something like that
unless there's an element of truth to it.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.620
Whether you were raped that night

35:22.703 --> 35:25.456
or invented a story
about being raped that night,

35:26.541 --> 35:29.168
I think the truth is you've been violated.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.173
You're carrying burdens
that were dumped on you

35:34.257 --> 35:38.219
by people who didn't love you
as well as you deserve to be loved.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.847
And that's what I'm curious about.

35:41.180 --> 35:45.017
How I might help you carry those burdens
a little more lightly...

35:45.810 --> 35:48.146
or maybe even lay some of them down.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.404
But this is your time.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.241
And we have a few minutes.

36:00.616 --> 36:03.494
If there's something you want to tell me
about that night...

36:04.537 --> 36:05.997
I would love to listen.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.120
Good work back there today, Detective.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.457
Thanks for your help.

36:49.999 --> 36:50.999
You bet.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.299
Congratulations, Detective.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.301
Thank you. Team effort.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.308
Way to be, Detective.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.767
Thank you.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.872
Son of a bitch.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.458
You old softie. You gave it to her.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.086
I didn't give her anything. She earned it.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.507
Well, how'd it go?

37:40.508 --> 37:41.676
Great.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.759
Yeah.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.095
Uh...

37:45.012 --> 37:46.264
it went down easy.

37:46.555 --> 37:48.599
We got everything on the affidavit.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.477
Every single thing.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.062
Yeah. It was... it was kinda...

37:53.688 --> 37:54.689
unbelievable.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.651
You should've been there.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.487
Yeah, well, can't do everything.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.031
- Hey, did he ask for a lawyer?
- Yeah.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.882
- So, we can't talk to him.
- No.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.410
Man, that's too bad.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.290
Come with me.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.042
What? Where?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.002
Just come.

38:34.603 --> 38:38.316
Mr. McCarthy, I'm Detective Rasmussen,
this is Detective Duvall.

38:40.192 --> 38:41.319
What's going on?

38:42.445 --> 38:46.324
No one's told me anything.
Somebody has to tell me what is happening.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.327
We're investigating a series of crimes.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.287
You match the description of our suspect.

38:52.538 --> 38:53.873
In what ways? What crimes?

38:54.665 --> 38:55.833
May I look at your leg?

38:56.959 --> 39:00.171
What? Why? I mean, yeah, but...

39:00.254 --> 39:02.131
Will you lift up your pant leg?
The left one.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.596
Wait.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.724
You're looking for a birthmark.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.478
You're looking for my brother.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.772
We have your brother.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.610
What did he do?

39:22.902 --> 39:25.946
- You tell me.
- I don't know. I have no idea. I...

39:30.659 --> 39:31.952
Was he building a bomb?

39:33.329 --> 39:35.790
Was he... was he gonna blow some place up?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.466
What did he do?

39:45.549 --> 39:47.301
Your brother is a serial rapist.

39:49.178 --> 39:52.473
He breaks into women's homes,
ties them up, then he rapes them

39:52.765 --> 39:55.643
repeatedly... for hours.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.444
Did you know this about him?

40:18.207 --> 40:19.207
Are you sure?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.252
- Yes.
- A hundred percent?

40:21.335 --> 40:22.335
Yep.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.763
I... I swear, I had no idea.

40:35.641 --> 40:39.478
I mean, he's weird,
but a lot of people are weird, you know.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.771
I figured...

40:42.648 --> 40:43.732
I don't know.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.360
I don't know what I figured.

40:47.695 --> 40:48.737
Not this.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.991
It's gonna destroy my mom.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.496
You should've just killed him.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.541
That would hurt her less.

42:46.981 --> 42:47.981
Hey.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.232
Oh, hey.

42:50.442 --> 42:52.236
Wha... what are you doing in there?

42:53.028 --> 42:54.029
Look what I found.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.206
Very nice.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.292
Wow.

43:09.169 --> 43:11.255
Uh, you had time to go to the parts yard.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.218
Does that mean you got your guy?

43:18.012 --> 43:19.013
It does.

43:21.890 --> 43:22.890
Good job.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.439
Thanks.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.997
Hey, I feel lousy about making you get
that file for me.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.667
Especially when I was wrong about Massey.

43:49.418 --> 43:51.920
Uh, y... you didn't make me do anything.

43:52.546 --> 43:55.257
And you weren't wrong about Massey.
That guy's a shitty human being.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.467
He shouldn't be a cop.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.139
I don't know.

44:03.265 --> 44:05.434
If I had to do it over,
I don't know what I'd do.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.187
Doing it didn't feel right,

44:08.270 --> 44:11.982
and... not doing it
didn't feel right either.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.570
Fucking gray zone, man.

44:20.115 --> 44:21.115
Not a fan.

44:29.708 --> 44:33.128
- How far did you get with this?
- Not very. I just started.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.381
Scoot over.

45:42.239 --> 45:46.118
Okay, I'm still working on the hard drive.
He has a serious encryption system on it.

45:47.369 --> 45:49.538
But I was able to get through
all his SD cards.

45:49.621 --> 45:52.708
I put all the photos McCarthy took
of his victims into a file for you.

45:53.459 --> 45:56.044
They're not easy to look at.
I had to take couple of breaks.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.756
Just click through.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.841
So, basically,
you were assaulted twice.

46:43.675 --> 46:45.093
Once by your attacker,

46:46.011 --> 46:47.554
then again by the police.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.350
Yeah, I guess.

46:51.433 --> 46:54.019
I am so sorry, Marie.

46:54.102 --> 46:55.145
It's not your fault.

46:55.229 --> 46:57.272
It's brave of you to revisit it.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.024
That's not easy.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.611
Thank you for trusting me.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.100
Mm.

47:34.351 --> 47:36.436
Can I ask you one thing
before you go?

47:36.520 --> 47:37.520
Okay.

47:38.313 --> 47:40.899
Understanding that none of this
was your fault,

47:40.983 --> 47:44.069
it was a horrible situation
that was imposed on you.

47:44.820 --> 47:49.950
I wonder if there's something of value
you can take from it.

47:52.786 --> 47:56.915
This might not be the last time
in your life that you're misunderstood...

47:59.334 --> 48:00.669
or mistrusted.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.548
I just wonder if there's a way
to think about it.

48:04.882 --> 48:08.677
About how you might manage
this kind of injustice

48:09.052 --> 48:10.554
if it were to happen again.

48:17.436 --> 48:23.233
Okay, I... I... I know I'm supposed to say,
if I had it to do over, I wouldn't lie.

48:25.193 --> 48:26.737
But the truth is...

48:28.447 --> 48:29.948
I would lie earlier...

48:32.075 --> 48:33.243
and better.

48:36.413 --> 48:37.789
Recognize everyone?

48:39.625 --> 48:40.792
Yeah, we know them.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.173
I would just figure it out on my own...

48:47.215 --> 48:48.258
by myself.

48:51.428 --> 48:54.640
All right. Well, uh, you let us know
when you get into that hard drive.

48:54.723 --> 48:55.891
Wait, hang on.

48:56.975 --> 48:57.975
There's one more.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.483
<i>No matter how much someone says
they care about you,</i>

49:04.566 --> 49:05.609
they just don't.

49:08.153 --> 49:09.196
Not enough.

49:13.283 --> 49:17.120
I mean, maybe they... they...
they mean to or they try to, but...

49:18.163 --> 49:20.457
other things end up being more important.

49:21.750 --> 49:24.878
He reused this one a bunch,
so the quality's pretty degraded.

49:27.172 --> 49:30.884
But there are eight pictures here
that he deleted but didn't overwrite yet.

49:33.136 --> 49:34.346
They're of someone else.

49:40.185 --> 49:43.605
So, yeah, I guess I'd... I'd...
I'd start with that.

49:46.358 --> 49:47.358
Lying.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.112
<i>'Cause even with good people...</i>

49:52.531 --> 49:54.908
even with people
that you can kinda trust...

49:58.996 --> 50:01.039
if the truth is inconvenient...

50:04.126 --> 50:07.337
and if... if the truth
doesn't, like, fit...

50:09.423 --> 50:10.632
they don't believe it.

50:11.216 --> 50:12.259
Who is that?

50:13.135 --> 50:14.594
She looks 12.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.809
Even if they really care about you...

50:22.978 --> 50:24.021
they just...

50:26.773 --> 50:27.941
they just don't.
