00:03.903 --> 00:05.770
<i>(all) tool time!</i>

00:05.771 --> 00:07.405
That's right.

00:07.406 --> 00:10.374
Binford tools
is proud to present
tim "the tool man" taylor!

00:10.375 --> 00:11.876
Whoo!
<i>(applause)</i>

00:11.877 --> 00:14.212
Thank you, heidi,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

00:14.213 --> 00:16.213
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:16.215 --> 00:19.317
You all know my assistant,
al "objects keep falling
on my head" borland.

00:19.318 --> 00:21.987
We're dressed like this today
in our construction vests

00:21.988 --> 00:25.724
Because on <i>tool time</i>
we begin high steel week.

00:25.725 --> 00:28.459
Hi, steel.

00:28.460 --> 00:31.462
Al, say hello
to the girder.

00:31.463 --> 00:33.598
They're inanimate objects,
tim.

00:33.599 --> 00:36.501
Well, so are you,
but we talk every day.

00:37.803 --> 00:39.638
Working on the high steel

00:39.639 --> 00:42.406
Takes courage
and intestinal fortitude,

00:42.407 --> 00:45.176
A lot like working with tim.

00:45.177 --> 00:48.079
That's right, a...

00:48.080 --> 00:49.881
That's right, al.

00:49.882 --> 00:52.550
It takes a certain kind of man
to navigate the high steel.

00:52.551 --> 00:55.586
There's no two better guys
to tell us some safety tips
about walking the girders

00:55.587 --> 00:58.589
Than the boys
from k&b construction company
up there in bay city, michigan.

00:58.590 --> 01:01.292
Let's give
a big round of applause
for dwayne and pete.

01:01.293 --> 01:07.298
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

01:07.299 --> 01:09.433
It's great
to have you guys
on the show.

01:09.434 --> 01:11.435
Always great
to be here,
timmy.

01:11.436 --> 01:12.837
Especially today, tim,

01:12.838 --> 01:14.839
Because we have
brought along
some other boys...

01:14.840 --> 01:16.340
Dwayne! Dwayne!

01:16.341 --> 01:20.812
Say hello to sam, tom,
tim, pete, john, bill,

01:20.813 --> 01:24.849
John-bob, bob-bob,
billy-bob and bob.

01:24.850 --> 01:27.719
Hey, k&bers,
how you doin'?

01:27.720 --> 01:30.555
Maybe after the show
you all go back
to al-bob's house,

01:30.556 --> 01:32.390
Have some milk
and cookies.

01:32.391 --> 01:34.893
Before we head out
to the real job site,
though,

01:34.894 --> 01:36.728
We're gonna learn
some safety tips

01:36.729 --> 01:38.897
About walking
on top of the high steel.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.899
First, pete would like
to demonstrate

01:40.900 --> 01:42.801
The correct technique.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.635
Technique is important, tim.

01:44.636 --> 01:46.470
Otherwise you could slip

01:46.471 --> 01:49.373
And end up
six inches shorter.

01:49.374 --> 01:50.942
Like dwayne.

01:53.212 --> 01:57.615
I find the safest way
to walk the steel

01:57.616 --> 02:02.486
Is with one foot directly
in front of the other.

02:02.487 --> 02:06.257
That would be the one-foot-
directly-in-front-of-the-other
technique.

02:06.258 --> 02:09.060
<i>(hisses)</i>

02:09.061 --> 02:11.395
And tim, on those
extra-windy days,

02:11.396 --> 02:14.733
You may want to...
Use an arm...

02:14.734 --> 02:16.567
For balance.

02:16.568 --> 02:18.236
Nice hip action, guy.

02:18.237 --> 02:21.339
You're not the first
to say so, timmy.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.674
Well, we've seen pete
strut his stuff.

02:23.675 --> 02:27.078
Maybe we can get al up there
and see some of that
famous borland balance.

02:27.079 --> 02:29.247
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

02:31.183 --> 02:34.152
These beams are made
of solid steel.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.154
They're made
to hold up to two tons,

02:36.155 --> 02:38.890
So I think al
will be all right.

02:40.860 --> 02:44.129
Whoo, graceful
as a gazelle.
Klaus?

02:44.130 --> 02:46.998
<i>(â™ª "those magnificent men</i>
<i>in their flying machines")</i>

02:50.069 --> 02:51.269
<i>(music stops)</i>

02:51.270 --> 02:53.437
One important thing
to remember about the high steel

02:53.438 --> 02:55.706
Is sometimes
you need a girder
with extra support.

02:55.707 --> 02:58.777
<i>(beam creaks)</i>

03:00.279 --> 03:03.481
I think in al's case,
we need an 18-hour girder.

04:13.152 --> 04:16.154
What do you think? Should we
put the kids in the middle?

04:18.724 --> 04:21.059
Ready, set...

04:21.060 --> 04:22.560
Hut-hut hike!

04:24.964 --> 04:26.865
Whoa!

04:26.866 --> 04:29.567
Yes.
What a wimp.

04:29.568 --> 04:31.402
Hey, guys, guys...
Oh, good job.

04:31.403 --> 04:33.104
Think fast.
Ooh.

04:33.105 --> 04:36.140
Guess what's coming back
to the house in two weeks.

04:36.141 --> 04:38.743
I'll give you a hint.
It goes vroom,
vroom, vroom.

04:38.744 --> 04:42.013
Ha. Usually
everything around here
goes vroom, vroom, boom.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.352
The hot rod.
Oh, cool,
the hot rod.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.354
When she's painted,
is she all done?

04:49.355 --> 04:52.790
Well... Gotta wire it,
put the upholstery in,

04:52.791 --> 04:54.792
And then the hard part -

04:54.793 --> 04:58.396
Talk your mom
into sitting in the front seat
with a tube top and hot pants.

05:00.699 --> 05:04.369
Do you think maybe
if nobody tells mom...
Can I drive it?

05:04.370 --> 05:07.738
Well, I was kinda waiting
to surprise you...

05:07.739 --> 05:11.475
No!

05:11.476 --> 05:13.878
Hi, guys.
<i>(brad)</i> hi, mom.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.313
Hey, baby.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.916
Axleby says the hot rod
should be painted in two weeks,

05:17.917 --> 05:19.750
So get out your hot pants.

05:19.751 --> 05:21.752
Tim, I have never worn
hot pants,

05:21.753 --> 05:23.754
I'm never going to wear
hot pants,

05:23.755 --> 05:27.558
So if hot pants
are important to you,
you wear 'em.

05:28.794 --> 05:31.262
There's a pretty picture.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.267
So, my mother
called today.
Yeah?

05:36.268 --> 05:38.937
The bonds that she bought
for the kids are coming due.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.605
I can't believe she thought
she had to remind me.

05:41.606 --> 05:43.341
Well, did you remember?

05:43.342 --> 05:48.146
No, I didn't remember,
mr. Butt out if you have
nothing constructive to say.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.348
Why do you always
get mad at me

05:50.349 --> 05:52.450
When you talk
to <i>your</i> mother?

05:52.451 --> 05:54.118
I'm not mad.

05:54.119 --> 05:56.921
I'm just expressing
my feelings.

05:56.922 --> 05:59.424
You should learn how
to be more selfish.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.459
Just keep your feelings
to yourself.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.195
I told her that I thought
the boys were old enough

06:04.196 --> 06:06.230
To have some say
where their money goes.

06:06.231 --> 06:10.301
She says no - I should
just reinvest the bonds
and not even tell them.

06:10.302 --> 06:12.703
I don't want you to hit me,
but I think your mom's right.

06:12.704 --> 06:17.208
<i>(mumbles)</i> you're agreeing
with my mother?
<i>(imitates her mumble)</i>

06:18.543 --> 06:21.446
Let's face it, the boys
are childish, irresponsible.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.648
They can't handle money.
They're like me.

06:24.649 --> 06:27.852
Well, I don't want them
to be like you,

06:27.853 --> 06:30.188
So I say we present them

06:30.189 --> 06:32.457
With all
the different options,

06:32.458 --> 06:35.860
And they choose
their own investment.

06:35.861 --> 06:38.162
Like real estate.

06:38.163 --> 06:40.431
What are they gonna get
for 50 bucks apiece?

06:40.432 --> 06:43.534
Really little apartments.

06:44.569 --> 06:46.770
No, brooks robinson!
Roger maris!

06:46.771 --> 06:48.772
No, sandy koufax!
Then yogi berra!

06:48.773 --> 06:51.342
Sandy koufax
was the best pitcher ever.

06:51.343 --> 06:54.112
Yogi berra
was such a good hitter.
Brooks robinson!

06:54.113 --> 06:57.482
It's time for you
to go to bed. Come on.
What are you arguing about?

06:57.483 --> 07:00.151
We've been thinking about
what you said about the money.

07:00.152 --> 07:01.986
We know what we wanna do.

07:01.987 --> 07:04.855
Oh, good. Ok.
What did you decide on?

07:04.856 --> 07:07.858
College fund, savings account,
another bond?

07:07.859 --> 07:09.293
Baseball cards.

07:09.294 --> 07:12.397
Baseball cards?

07:12.398 --> 07:15.366
Look at this card.
Honus wagner.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.368
It originally sold
for a penny.

07:17.369 --> 07:20.405
Now it's worth
$450,000.

07:20.406 --> 07:23.241
So we figured
if we put our money together

07:23.242 --> 07:25.576
And we buy a card for $150,

07:25.577 --> 07:28.779
Someday it could be worth
six billion.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.318
Brad, I'm not sure
that every card

07:34.319 --> 07:37.755
Gives you
a 40 million percent return.

07:37.756 --> 07:40.758
Well, maybe not that much,
but look in the book.

07:40.759 --> 07:43.561
Most of them double
and triple their value.

07:43.562 --> 07:46.697
Well... I gotta say

07:46.698 --> 07:49.733
This shows some
very creative thinking,
you know?

07:49.734 --> 07:51.735
The only thing is,
there's no way

07:51.736 --> 07:54.605
That the three of you
are gonna be able
to share one card.

07:54.606 --> 07:58.842
But mom,
if we each pitch in our $50,
we could get a better card.

07:58.843 --> 08:01.979
Maybe, but I'm remembering
those bloody noses that resulted

08:01.980 --> 08:05.816
That time you tried to share
that 50-cent nutty buddy bar.

08:07.352 --> 08:11.589
Oh, yeah, the famous
bloody nutty buddy bar
incident.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.291
Yeah.

08:17.596 --> 08:21.099
<i>(randy)</i> oh, wow.
Don't touch anything.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.735
Whoo, the smell
of sports dust
in the air.

08:24.736 --> 08:27.271
Kinda takes you back
to your childhood.

08:27.272 --> 08:30.908
Dad, this is
our childhood.

08:30.909 --> 08:33.077
Wow, look at
all these cards.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.078
How are we gonna know
what to buy?

08:35.080 --> 08:36.581
That's why I'm here.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.783
Dad, you don't know anything
about baseball cards.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.453
Yeah, mom should've come.

08:43.755 --> 08:45.256
Look, honus...

08:45.257 --> 08:47.925
You don't need people in here
that know about baseball.

08:47.926 --> 08:50.094
You need someone here
who knows about business.

08:50.095 --> 08:52.530
Well, then why
are you here?

08:52.531 --> 08:54.532
Excuse me.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.701
My sons are interested
in baseball cards
as an investment,

08:57.702 --> 09:00.104
And they don't want
to get ripped off.

09:00.105 --> 09:03.641
Sorry, all we do
is rip people off.
Store policy.

09:05.310 --> 09:08.312
All right, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to insult you, mr...

09:08.313 --> 09:11.482
Ripoffer.
Conman t. Ripoffer.

09:12.917 --> 09:15.886
From the famous
jack-the-ripoffer family?

09:18.557 --> 09:21.659
Don't worry, I'll give you
a good price. Go browse.
All right, thanks.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.962
Hey, dad, check this out.
An andy pafko.

09:24.963 --> 09:27.731
Who's andy pafko?
He was, uh...

09:27.732 --> 09:30.768
$1300. Keep browsin'.

09:34.173 --> 09:37.375
What kind of idiot comes
to a store like this
for a frying pan?

09:37.376 --> 09:40.578
It's a swedish pancake maker
signed by bjorn borg.

09:40.579 --> 09:43.013
Really?

09:43.014 --> 09:45.716
I think I remember him
serving those at wimbledon.

09:47.952 --> 09:52.490
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
look, an indy car.

09:52.491 --> 09:55.593
Oh, it even has
a remote control. Cool!

09:55.594 --> 09:57.595
This is better than cool.

09:57.596 --> 10:01.299
Rick mears drove this
to a victory in '84.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.301
Oh, man, it's autographed.

10:03.302 --> 10:06.537
Dad, why don't we
buy something like this?
Hey, hold on a second.

10:06.538 --> 10:09.106
Hey, mr. Con,
or mr. Man...
Mr. Con man?

10:11.276 --> 10:14.078
What kind of an investment
is this mears car?

10:14.079 --> 10:17.147
Well, it's been
a very good one for me.
It's already doubled in value.

10:17.148 --> 10:19.350
No kiddin'.
What are you askin' for it?

10:19.351 --> 10:20.618
$140.

10:20.619 --> 10:21.785
Oh, cool.

10:21.786 --> 10:23.787
If all three of us
put our money together,

10:23.788 --> 10:26.290
We could buy it
and still have $10
left over. Yeah.

10:26.291 --> 10:27.791
<i>(whistles)</i>
yeah.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.793
I think
we're all forgetting

10:29.794 --> 10:32.996
The bloody
nutty buddy bar
incident.

10:32.997 --> 10:35.399
But you heard the guy.
It's a great investment.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.535
Yeah,
it's already doubled.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.103
Yeah.

10:39.104 --> 10:41.939
I was at this race.
It was a great victory
for him.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.007
Love to have this souvenir
in our house.

10:44.008 --> 10:46.944
We could get rid
of those pictures,
put it up on the mantel.

10:46.945 --> 10:48.946
Dad, those are pictures
of us.

10:48.947 --> 10:51.315
Oh. Well,
we'll squeeze 'em in.

11:07.065 --> 11:09.634
This is way better
than a baseball card,

11:09.635 --> 11:11.636
Because if we bought
one of those,

11:11.637 --> 11:15.873
All we'd be doing right now
is staring at it.

11:15.874 --> 11:19.543
That's what
we are doing, dork.

11:19.544 --> 11:21.579
Shut up!

11:21.580 --> 11:23.581
Why can't we play
with it?

11:23.582 --> 11:26.584
Because the guy at the store
said we're not supposed
to touch it

11:26.585 --> 11:28.753
If we want it
to be an investment.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.255
It has to stay
in mint condition.

11:31.256 --> 11:33.257
That stinks.

11:35.627 --> 11:38.228
I wonder how fast
it goes.

11:52.243 --> 11:55.245
Did you open the gate
to the alley?
Yeah.

11:55.246 --> 11:58.482
All right, I'll go first.
Hey, no,
it was my idea.

11:58.483 --> 11:59.983
No, oldest first.
No way!

11:59.984 --> 12:01.819
Then biggest first.
What about me?

12:01.820 --> 12:03.921
Get real.

12:03.922 --> 12:06.590
It's in the alley.
Let's go!
<i>(truck backup signal beeping)</i>

12:06.591 --> 12:08.693
<i>(plastic crunches)</i>

12:12.731 --> 12:15.265
We should have gotten
insurance.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.939
Perfect.
You can't even tell

12:21.940 --> 12:24.274
It was sideswiped
by a garbage truck.

12:24.275 --> 12:25.776
I don't know.

12:25.777 --> 12:28.646
The front bumper
still looks like
it's kinda drooping.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.981
Mark, put on
another piece of gum.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.119
Good as new.

12:36.120 --> 12:41.058
We just need to make sure
nobody can see it
from the side.

12:41.059 --> 12:43.193
Did we save
rick mears' autograph?

12:43.194 --> 12:49.600
Uh, sort of.
It says, "..Ick mea..."

12:49.601 --> 12:52.603
Let's put it on the mantel
and get outta here.

12:52.604 --> 12:53.804
Ok.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.175
Oh, let's go,
come on.
Ok.

12:58.176 --> 13:00.010
<i>(brad)</i> hey, dad!
Hi, guys.

13:00.011 --> 13:01.512
<i>(brad)</i> bye, dad.

13:01.513 --> 13:03.848
Bye? I thought you guys
would stick around,

13:03.849 --> 13:06.350
And we'll stare at the car
for a while.

13:06.351 --> 13:08.686
We've been starin' at it
for two hours.

13:08.687 --> 13:12.289
We're takin' a little bit
of a... Stare break.

13:17.562 --> 13:19.630
Hi.
Hi.

13:19.631 --> 13:22.433
Take a look
at our new investment.

13:22.434 --> 13:27.271
Feast your eyes
on rick mears'
1984 indy winner.

13:27.272 --> 13:30.674
Oh, no!
Did one of the boys buy that
instead of a baseball card?

13:30.675 --> 13:33.176
They pitched in
and bought it together.
They're gonna share it.

13:33.177 --> 13:35.813
No, they were supposed to make
three separate investments.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.883
We couldn't
pass this up.
This toy?

13:38.884 --> 13:40.584
This toy?

13:40.585 --> 13:43.153
This toy...
Oh, man.

13:43.154 --> 13:45.689
...Is an autographed
one-of-a-kind.

13:48.059 --> 13:50.060
They keep this
in mint condition,

13:50.061 --> 13:52.095
It'll double its price.

13:52.096 --> 13:54.131
You said mint condition?
Yeah.

13:54.132 --> 13:57.367
Was that spearmint
or peppermint?

13:58.804 --> 14:00.838
Why is there gum on this?

14:00.839 --> 14:05.342
It's holding this paper clip
in place here. Ugh.

14:05.343 --> 14:09.212
What is "...Ick mea..."?

14:09.213 --> 14:11.248
Oh, man!

14:11.249 --> 14:13.551
I can't believe
you let them do this.

14:13.552 --> 14:16.219
Before the steam starts
coming out of your nose,
let me explain.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.255
You don't have to explain.
I know what happened.

14:18.256 --> 14:21.559
You all went to the store,
you saw the car,
you started drooling,

14:21.560 --> 14:25.796
The drooling led to grunting,
the grunting led to buying.

14:25.797 --> 14:28.866
You are so far off,
it's not even funny.

14:30.268 --> 14:34.438
We grunted, drooled,
bought.

14:34.439 --> 14:38.909
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,
and welcome to the high steel!

14:38.910 --> 14:42.513
Hey, timmy!
I'll be right up.

14:45.049 --> 14:48.085
We'll take the elevator up,
which is right behind me.
Follow me over there.

14:48.086 --> 14:50.087
Course, you all know
my assistant,

14:50.088 --> 14:52.957
Al "steel crazy
after all these years" borland.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.992
That's right, tim.
I love steel.

14:54.993 --> 14:57.027
It's durable,
reliable and cheap,

14:57.028 --> 14:59.062
Everything I look for
in an alloy.

14:59.063 --> 15:01.632
Everything you look for
in a date.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.867
Timmy!

15:02.868 --> 15:04.702
Oh, pete bilker
from k&b construction.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.537
He'll be takin' us
up top.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.206
It's good to be
on the job site
with you finally.

15:09.207 --> 15:11.876
It's great to have you guys
come see us for a change.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.144
I love what you done
with the place.

15:14.145 --> 15:17.581
Thanks, al. I picked out
the fire-retardant monaco
color myself.

15:17.582 --> 15:19.082
It shows.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.351
You guys pick out
your china pattern
later.

15:21.352 --> 15:26.824
Right now I wanna get
up to the high steel!

15:26.825 --> 15:29.693
<i>(dwayne)</i> hey, timmy!
Come on up!

15:29.694 --> 15:31.695
<i>(pete)</i> tim, remember,

15:31.696 --> 15:35.432
One foot directly
in front of the other.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.434
Thanks, pete.
I'm right behind you.

15:37.435 --> 15:39.570
Whoo!
Like it up here?

15:39.571 --> 15:42.673
We're finally up here
on the high steel,
where men belong.

15:42.674 --> 15:44.808
I call this
"iron country safari."

15:44.809 --> 15:46.644
Arr-arr-arr-arr.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.146
I've been cooped up
in the studio too long.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.649
I've forgotten
what it's like
to be outside,

15:51.650 --> 15:54.852
Working next to men
who know what
they're doing.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.354
Tim, right behind us,
you might be interested -

15:57.355 --> 15:59.757
It's where we're welding
our skylight support.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.759
Can you see that
from down there?

16:01.760 --> 16:04.895
And if you look
way down there,

16:04.896 --> 16:08.032
You can see 'em pouring
them concrete decks.

16:08.033 --> 16:12.469
Uhh...

16:12.470 --> 16:16.040
I can see that you fasten
your girders to the beam

16:16.041 --> 16:19.409
Using tc bolts with
tension-indicating washers.

16:19.410 --> 16:21.244
You've got a good eye,
timmy.

16:21.245 --> 16:23.447
Right back over here...
Al, take a left there...

16:23.448 --> 16:26.116
I always wonder
what you do up here
when nature calls.

16:26.117 --> 16:28.953
What do you do,
just let it fly and hope
you don't hit the foreman?

16:28.954 --> 16:31.121
Look out!

16:31.122 --> 16:34.224
Well, actually,
that is the way
dwayne does it, tim.

16:34.225 --> 16:37.661
The rest of us, we just
take the elevator down
to the porta-potti below.

16:37.662 --> 16:39.529
Hey, wait a minute.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.531
Get this rope here,

16:41.532 --> 16:44.001
Just attach it here
to my 'biner,

16:44.002 --> 16:47.104
And you can just head down
towards that porta-potti
right down there.

16:47.105 --> 16:49.406
Tim, be careful.
Well, I don't know, al...

16:49.407 --> 16:55.245
Oh! Whoa... Aah!

17:00.151 --> 17:02.753
Tim, are you all right?

17:02.754 --> 17:05.856
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Whoo!

17:05.857 --> 17:08.058
Long as I'm down here...

17:08.059 --> 17:10.894
Could somebody send me
a magazine?

17:14.198 --> 17:16.599
Hi, wilson.
Hi-ho, tim.

17:16.601 --> 17:18.801
Whatever you're cooking
sure smells good.

17:18.803 --> 17:20.470
Why, thank you, neighbor.

17:20.471 --> 17:24.473
I'd offer you some,
but this is my homemade
shoe polish.

17:24.474 --> 17:26.476
So how was your day?

17:26.477 --> 17:28.310
Oh, same old, same old.

17:28.311 --> 17:31.715
Went to work, made fun of al,
crashed through a porta-potti.

17:31.716 --> 17:33.817
Hmm. Sounds full.

17:33.818 --> 17:35.819
Oh, that wasn't it.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.321
Supposed to teach the boys
something about investment,

17:38.322 --> 17:40.958
Went to buy some
one-of-a-kind baseball cards.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.460
I let them buy
a remote-control car instead.

17:43.461 --> 17:45.896
So jack was sent out
to sell the cow,

17:45.897 --> 17:48.732
And instead he returns
with a handful of magic beans.

17:48.733 --> 17:52.302
What? Beans? Jack?
What are you talkin' about?

17:52.303 --> 17:55.372
I think you been
sniffin' the fumes
in that shoe polish too long.

17:55.373 --> 17:57.675
What do you think?
<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:57.676 --> 18:00.343
I don't know.
I went into that store
with the kids.

18:00.344 --> 18:02.980
When I saw that car,
I just turned into a big kid.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.815
I wanted it myself.
<i>(laughs)</i>

18:04.816 --> 18:06.817
Well, tim,
I've always believed

18:06.818 --> 18:09.820
The spirit of the child
lives on in the man.

18:09.821 --> 18:11.488
However, in your case,

18:11.489 --> 18:13.991
I think the spirit
has completely taken over.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.927
I've always been a toy freak.
I loved them when I was a kid.

18:16.928 --> 18:19.763
Even when I couldn't
afford cool ones,
I made my own toys.

18:19.764 --> 18:22.933
Tim taylor toys.
They must have been
the talk of the neighborhood.

18:22.934 --> 18:26.670
Oh, yeah, especially
when they caught fire
and exploded.

18:26.671 --> 18:28.672
It must have been difficult,

18:28.673 --> 18:31.608
Not being able to afford
the things you love so much.

18:31.609 --> 18:34.511
No toys for tim.
It was tragic, yeah.

18:34.512 --> 18:36.847
But nowadays,
when you see something

18:36.848 --> 18:40.417
That you wanted
when you were a boy,
you get pretty excited.

18:40.418 --> 18:42.920
Yeah, I guess
I do get pretty excited,

18:42.921 --> 18:46.389
And that excitement
probably rubbed off on the boys
when we walked into that store.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.391
Well, tim,
it's not uncommon.

18:48.392 --> 18:51.962
We all try to grasp
the pieces of our youth
that never were.

18:51.963 --> 18:56.133
You didn't have toys,
my mother wouldn't let me
talk to my neighbors.

18:57.635 --> 19:00.137
Tim?

19:00.138 --> 19:01.205
Tim?

19:04.776 --> 19:06.643
Hi.

19:06.644 --> 19:08.011
Hi.

19:08.012 --> 19:10.848
I've been doin'
a lot of thinkin'.

19:10.849 --> 19:13.851
I should have let the boys
buy the baseball cards,

19:13.852 --> 19:15.953
But I know why I didn't.

19:15.954 --> 19:18.021
I got a child inside of me.

19:18.022 --> 19:22.893
Really?
What month are you in?

19:22.894 --> 19:25.996
No, honey...
I'm just like a big kid.

19:25.997 --> 19:28.932
Just because I like indy cars

19:28.933 --> 19:31.802
Doesn't mean we should have
bought the thing.

19:31.803 --> 19:34.972
I should have listened to you
and just reinvested the bonds.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.474
This isn't your fault.
It's not your fault.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.476
Well,
it's somebody's fault.

19:39.477 --> 19:42.880
<i>(both)</i> the boys'.
<i>(boys shouting)</i>

19:42.881 --> 19:45.215
I think I hear
our little demolition men now.

19:45.216 --> 19:47.384
I'll flip you to see
who yells at them first.

19:47.385 --> 19:50.553
I have a better idea.
Put the thing back
on the mantel.

19:50.554 --> 19:53.056
What are you thinkin'
about?
You'll see.

19:53.057 --> 19:55.725
Wait, wait, wait, they're
just walking in right now.

19:55.726 --> 19:59.897
Hey, guys, that man
from the baseball store's
on the phone.

19:59.898 --> 20:01.899
He is?
Yeah.

20:01.900 --> 20:05.903
He says that he has a guy
who collects indy cars
who wants to buy yours.

20:05.904 --> 20:09.773
He'll give you $200
for it.
Hey! Hey!

20:09.774 --> 20:11.541
Hey, hey, hey.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.576
That's a $60 profit
in a day.

20:13.577 --> 20:15.279
Let's go for it.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.880
We're not
interested.

20:16.881 --> 20:20.150
What?
They're not interested.
I'm s...

20:20.151 --> 20:24.221
300? He'll give you $300.

20:24.222 --> 20:28.458
300 shamolies,
smackeroonies!

20:28.459 --> 20:30.894
300 bucks?
I'll get the car.

20:30.895 --> 20:31.962
<i>(all)</i> no, no, no, dad!

20:31.963 --> 20:35.432
Dad, it's ok.
You know, we pass.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.935
Yeah, we're not
selling.
Yeah.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.637
I'm sorry, they pass. <i>What?</i>

20:40.638 --> 20:42.105
No.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.942
$750?!

20:44.943 --> 20:46.944
<i>(mouths)</i>

20:46.945 --> 20:50.147
$750?!

20:50.148 --> 20:51.148
We'll take it.

20:51.149 --> 20:54.151
No, no, no, no!
No.

20:54.152 --> 20:55.719
We're not selling.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.222
Well, yeah, you know,
it's not just the money.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.825
The car has, uh...
Sentimental value.

21:01.826 --> 21:04.494
Well, I'm sorry, yeah,
it just doesn't look
like there's any way

21:04.495 --> 21:06.330
They're gonna sell that car.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.765
I mean...
Oh, well, ok. Bye-bye.

21:08.766 --> 21:11.568
Guys, I'm really proud of you.

21:11.569 --> 21:13.737
You made an investment,
you believe in it,

21:13.738 --> 21:15.739
You're gonna hang on to it.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.876
I just hope you're not
setting yourselves up
for a big disappointment.

21:18.877 --> 21:22.346
The investment's hot now,
but any day it could crash.

21:26.117 --> 21:27.650
<i>(randy)</i> nice going.

21:27.651 --> 21:30.320
<i>(brad)</i> you're the one
who drove it into the thing.

21:30.321 --> 21:31.821
But you're the one...

21:31.822 --> 21:33.523
<i>(mark)</i> no, you.
He ran...

21:39.497 --> 21:41.498
Hello, can I help you?

21:41.499 --> 21:45.102
I was shopping in the mall,
and I realized that
this is the store

21:45.103 --> 21:47.470
Where my boys bought
their toy indy car.

21:47.471 --> 21:51.241
Oh, yes, I remember.
I hope they're not
playing with it.

21:51.242 --> 21:54.278
Believe me, they're
definitely not playing with it.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.746
So what can I
do you for today?

21:56.747 --> 21:59.749
I was thinking about buying
the three little monsters

21:59.750 --> 22:02.352
One of these baseball cards
for christmas.

22:02.353 --> 22:04.888
What do you think
about these three here?
Oh, very good.

22:04.889 --> 22:08.591
They've doubled in value
since I got them.

22:08.592 --> 22:12.329
You know, I think
$40 is a little steep,
according to my book here,

22:12.330 --> 22:14.965
So do you mind
if I look around some more?

22:14.966 --> 22:17.234
No, please,
by all means, browse.

22:17.235 --> 22:20.370
Maybe I can find something
for my husband.

22:23.808 --> 22:25.809
What is this thing here?

22:25.810 --> 22:27.477
That's a very rare item.

22:27.478 --> 22:30.280
It's a swedish pancake maker
signed by bjorn borg.

22:30.281 --> 22:32.983
My husband
loves swedish pancakes.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.785
Wonderful with marmalade.
Really? I never
tried them like that.

22:35.786 --> 22:37.554
That's the way
bjorn eats them.

22:37.555 --> 22:40.023
This could be
a very interesting purchase.

22:40.024 --> 22:42.892
It's doubled in value
since I got it.

22:44.462 --> 22:47.297
If I buy the cards,
how much will this cost me?

22:47.298 --> 22:50.867
$50, and I'll throw in
a jar of marmalade.

22:50.868 --> 22:53.870
I'll give you ten.
Deal, but no marmalade.
