WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:09.167 --> 00:10.867
Oi-oi, you bunch of radgies!

00:12.133 --> 00:14.233
Last time, we tore up the Toon!

00:15.467 --> 00:17.967
(yelling)

00:18.033 --> 00:20.633
'With our friends...'
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

00:20.700 --> 00:23.067
...family, and Abbie's nana.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.467
(Abbie) Nana!

00:24.533 --> 00:26.900
Sam and Chloe's relationship
was tested.

00:28.867 --> 00:30.967
Sam!
Sophie fell out with Sam.

00:31.033 --> 00:33.167
Not getting jealous?
What you on about?

00:33.233 --> 00:35.033
Nathan fell out with Chloe!

00:36.033 --> 00:39.300
But we left
as one big happy family.

00:39.367 --> 00:41.867
To the family!
(all) To the family!

00:47.000 --> 00:48.533
The Geordies are back!

00:48.600 --> 00:50.100
Hello!

00:50.167 --> 00:51.767
'Doing the things we love.'

00:52.667 --> 00:54.433
'But this time...'

00:54.500 --> 00:57.000
Man's gonna mix things right up.

01:01.267 --> 01:03.667
(knocking)
With four newbies!

01:03.733 --> 01:05.333
Oh, my God!

01:05.400 --> 01:07.067
It's gonna be fucking mint.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.767
Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.567
I love a bit of change, me.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.900
But some things never change.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.833
I love this family.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.633
(bell rings)
Ding fucking ding, you dicks.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.967
(cheering)

01:27.033 --> 01:28.967
Take it all in, bitch.
Take it all in.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.433
I'm preened to perfection.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.667
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:34.733 --> 01:37.633
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.433
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.167
I'm fake, I'm flirty,
and I've got double-Fs.

01:43.233 --> 01:46.700
I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.

01:46.767 --> 01:48.700
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:58.767 --> 02:00.367
Morning.

02:00.433 --> 02:01.800
Morning.

02:01.867 --> 02:03.500
Since last time in the house,

02:03.567 --> 02:05.900
I've bagged myself a new
boyfriend,
Jay,

02:05.967 --> 02:09.600
and he is the love of my life,
and I couldn't be happier.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.767
(text alert)

02:20.467 --> 02:23.167
Single Nathan's definitely back,
isn't he?

02:25.100 --> 02:28.733
Most people are just getting up,
but I'm getting in from a night
out.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.667
'Since last time,
me and my boyfriend have broken
up.'

02:31.733 --> 02:34.167
Right now, I am trying to live
my best life.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.600
I'm home!

02:41.500 --> 02:43.633
I've got respect for you now,
you know.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.367
Is it cos you're a mam?
I'm a mam, you're grandma.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.900
I love being a grandma.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.700
A new addition to the family.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.200
Ivy has brought out
my maternal instinct,

02:52.267 --> 02:53.700
and I'm loving being a mam.

02:53.767 --> 02:55.400
There.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.267
Who's a little girl?

02:57.333 --> 02:59.067
There's Mammy's girl.

03:02.667 --> 03:03.667
That'll do.

03:03.733 --> 03:07.833
Since Ivy's arrived, everything
is all about her, and it's
full-on.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.633
Nowadays, me and Chloe
barely have sex,

03:10.700 --> 03:13.933
and I need to release tension.
That's why I started training.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.567
Work time again, and Anna's got
me
cleaning up the mess

03:24.633 --> 03:27.967
them divvies left last time.
What a liberty.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.733
Listen, you need to get
back to the house ASAP.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.833
Time to go back to work.
What?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.833
Adam, Faith and Abbie will not.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.100
Oh, my God.

03:37.167 --> 03:39.033
What the hell?

03:39.100 --> 03:41.967
And Holly will be part-time
as usual cos she's lazy.

03:42.033 --> 03:43.500
(chuckles)

03:43.567 --> 03:46.933
Yes, I am part-time, which means
I'm not gonna be there today.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.333
Also, I've left a little
surprise
for you.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.133
So, chop-chop, you dicks.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.133
Not only have I left these
divvies
a reminder of me,

03:55.200 --> 03:58.633
but me and Anna have also
rounded up
another surprise for them.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.900
It's gonna be a pure fucking
frisk.

04:00.967 --> 04:03.833
Do you think you're gonna
miss Mammy? Mammy's girl.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.867
(kissing noises)

04:05.933 --> 04:07.933
I am so excited to get back,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.400
but some of the family
aren't coming back.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.967
My head is baffled! My brain
hurts!

04:13.033 --> 04:15.167
Go!
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

04:18.767 --> 04:22.132
This is crazy. What have Anna
and Scott got up their sleeves?

04:22.200 --> 04:24.267
We need to get packed,
get to the house,

04:24.333 --> 04:25.867
and find out what's going on.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.400
What's that?
It's a photo of me and Ivy.

04:28.467 --> 04:30.067
Why is there two?
For Ivy.

04:30.133 --> 04:32.367
One for me, one for Ivy.
I can't be selfish.

04:32.433 --> 04:33.900
"One for Ivy"?

04:33.967 --> 04:35.633
I'm not gonna lie, getting Ivy,

04:35.700 --> 04:38.400
I thought it would prove
Sam would be a great dad.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.933
But so far, he's been fucking
shit.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.067
Who's this? Yes, you love it!

04:44.333 --> 04:47.567
That's what she thinks of it,
turned it upside down. Come on.

04:50.867 --> 04:54.633
'I am so excited to get back
to the house and see everyone.'

04:54.700 --> 04:57.333
Drive safe.
'Me and Jay have barely been
apart

04:57.400 --> 04:59.067
since the day we met.'

04:59.133 --> 05:02.767
I know I'm gonna miss Jay
every single second of the day.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.100
Bye!
Bye!

05:09.467 --> 05:12.200
(horn honks)

05:12.267 --> 05:13.667
Bye, then!

05:15.700 --> 05:20.033
Hello, you!
Come on in, you sexy, single
man.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.733
Stop shouting, man.

05:23.233 --> 05:25.800
Ooh...
This is to being back in the
Toon!

05:25.867 --> 05:27.967
Headache! Sophie!
Whoo!

05:31.133 --> 05:32.767
I tell you what though, Chloe,

05:32.833 --> 05:35.367
I'm buzzing
to actually get back in the
house.

05:35.433 --> 05:38.367
I can't wait to get away
from the dog for a bit.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.500
It means me and Chloe can
concentrate on us for a change,

05:41.567 --> 05:43.533
and I might even get my leg
over!

05:43.600 --> 05:46.433
I'm not fucking buzzing.
I just left my baby behind!

05:46.500 --> 05:49.133
I forgot about her.
Only been gone two minutes.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.700
I didn't forget,
it just wasn't on my mind.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.667
It's dangerous,
us two back together.

05:55.733 --> 05:59.233
I'm gutted, though,
because Abbie's not in the
house.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.500
That kills me.

06:00.567 --> 06:03.000
This time,
it's going to be different.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.533
'Abbie, Adam and Faith
are not coming back.'

06:05.600 --> 06:07.900
But it's also gonna be
the first time in ages

06:08.000 --> 06:09.700
I've been single in the house.

06:09.767 --> 06:13.600
I'm not going looking for love.
It's all about taking them
steps.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.100
Finding out who single me is.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.233
He just needs to get into
that house, have some fun,

06:19.300 --> 06:20.633
so he can move on.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.333
Nathan's gonna get some dick!

06:23.400 --> 06:25.300
Stop that.
(laughs)

06:25.367 --> 06:27.233
You make me uncomfortable.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.833
Exciting, isn't it?
Can you believe we're back?

06:32.900 --> 06:35.833
It doesn't seem like two minutes
since I've been here.

06:35.900 --> 06:40.333
But I'm buzzing, and I cannot
wait
to go out and get fucking
mortal.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.333
Look.
I can't wait to see it.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.833
Hello!
Hello!

06:44.900 --> 06:48.100
Open the door...
Oh, my God, there's a snooker
cue!

06:53.000 --> 06:55.533
The house looks amazing.
What does that say?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
Oh, have you seen this?
What?

06:58.667 --> 07:01.967
Look what the idiot's done.
Oh, my God...

07:02.033 --> 07:04.667
'Scotty T has written his name
on the floor.'

07:04.733 --> 07:06.200
What a twat.

07:07.533 --> 07:11.567
There's champagne and caviar.
Is there salmon?

07:11.633 --> 07:14.667
We're dead posh now!
Oh, my God! There's oysters!

07:14.733 --> 07:15.767
There's oysters!

07:15.833 --> 07:18.400
So, you know...
I've seen this in the movies.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.400
You don't swallow it, you drink
it.
Go on, then. Do it.

07:21.467 --> 07:24.067
Do it together.
Fucking stinks of fish...

07:24.133 --> 07:27.733
Do you eat the shell?
Don't, you'll take your veneer
out!

07:27.800 --> 07:29.133
One, two, three...

07:30.467 --> 07:31.767
Nothing came out.

07:31.833 --> 07:33.667
Oh, the juice did.
It's stuck.

07:33.733 --> 07:38.533
Champagne, caviar and oysters?
I feel like Meghan Markle!

07:38.600 --> 07:40.500
Fucking disgusting, that!

07:40.567 --> 07:41.700
Rank.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.033
Oh, there's a gym!

07:43.100 --> 07:46.033
Oh, my God, there's a new gym.
I will not be there.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.500
Catch me at the fridge,
how about that?

07:48.567 --> 07:50.067
It's got a disco ball!

07:50.133 --> 07:52.800
We'll be having sex in style.
I can't wait.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.800
I'm nervous.
Well...

07:56.867 --> 07:58.900
Like, really nervous.
Shit.

08:00.867 --> 08:02.833
Welcome home!

08:02.900 --> 08:04.067
Hello!

08:04.133 --> 08:06.800
(cheering)
Hello!

08:06.867 --> 08:09.267
Look at the house!
There's a pool table!

08:09.333 --> 08:11.133
Oh, my God, I love this!
Sophie!

08:11.200 --> 08:13.400
You look like Sandy from Grease!

08:13.467 --> 08:14.867
I look like a black bag.

08:14.933 --> 08:17.000
So nice to see these radgies
again.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.300
Can I just...
How are you?

08:19.367 --> 08:21.533
Why is there a big portrait of
Scott?

08:21.600 --> 08:24.333
How are you?
I'm good. Knew you'd be dressed
up.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.800
Seeing Nathan is so good.

08:25.867 --> 08:28.633
I hope this time we're gonna be
best friends again,

08:28.700 --> 08:30.033
cos I miss him so much.

08:31.933 --> 08:34.332
How are we all?
I'm fine, how are you?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.366
It's very empty, isn't it?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.866
It's so weird how it's just us
now.

08:38.933 --> 08:41.467
Don't get me wrong,
it's nice being together,

08:41.533 --> 08:45.133
but Abbie, Faith and Adam are
not
gonna walk through the door.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.000
This is so weird.
To us.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.033
To us!
To us, the remainder.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.300
The awesome foursome.
Fantastic four.

08:52.133 --> 08:54.700
It can't just be us four.
What's going on?

08:54.767 --> 08:56.800
What you doing?

08:56.867 --> 08:59.433
He's like this, "Ha, my evil
plan!"

09:06.067 --> 09:08.000
'My name's Bethan.'

09:08.067 --> 09:11.633
My friend Chloe has got no idea
that Anna has hired me.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.700
I can't wait to see her face
when I walk through that door.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.667
(knocking)

09:18.733 --> 09:21.333
Oh, my God. Who is that?

09:23.667 --> 09:25.633
Hello!
(all) Hi!

09:25.700 --> 09:27.433
Oh, my God!

09:27.500 --> 09:30.167
'Oh, my God!
It's my best friend, Bethan!'

09:30.233 --> 09:31.633
Yeah!

09:31.700 --> 09:34.100
(shouting)
Hi, Bethan!

09:34.167 --> 09:37.633
I knew something was going on.
It looks like Anna and Scott

09:37.700 --> 09:39.833
are sending in newbies. Oh, my
God.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.067
How are you?! How are you?
Good, and you?

09:43.133 --> 09:47.700
I know Bethan, and I know that
she is literally as mad as
Chloe.

09:48.700 --> 09:52.333
When did you know you were
coming?!
I knew for ages!

09:53.600 --> 09:56.467
Me and Chloe used to work
together
in a nightclub.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.033
When we go out,
we are like a fucking tornado.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.567
How long you been friends for?
Seven years?

10:01.633 --> 10:04.733
Went to Ayia Napa, and we were
so drunk we couldn't sleep,

10:04.800 --> 10:08.233
so we were both seeing who could
knock themselves out first.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.533
We had a patio door, right,
so we were running at this door,

10:11.600 --> 10:15.133
I'm going like that,
and knocking myself out...

10:15.200 --> 10:18.000
You couldn't sleep,
so you knocked yourselves out?

10:18.067 --> 10:21.800
(Sam) 'I can't believe Chloe's
best mate is joining the house.'

10:21.867 --> 10:24.700
This is either gonna be
brilliant,
or a nightmare.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.600
Tonight's gonna be amazing.
Can you drink like her?

10:27.667 --> 10:29.533
I'll try!
(laughter)

10:34.867 --> 10:36.767
Deep breath.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.233
(exhales)

10:38.300 --> 10:40.200
Hi, I'm Tahlia, I'm 21.

10:40.267 --> 10:42.533
'I'm a bit nervous.'

10:42.600 --> 10:45.667
I don't know what to expect.
I just hope they like us.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.733
Oh. Oh, God...

10:49.800 --> 10:51.900
Hello!

10:51.967 --> 10:54.100
Oh, my God, another person!
Hiya!

10:54.167 --> 10:56.200
'Oh, my God, it's another new
girl!'

10:56.267 --> 10:58.300
Are we getting any boys?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.100
What's your name?
I'm Tahlia.

11:00.167 --> 11:01.700
Tahlia, nice to meet you.

11:01.767 --> 11:04.033
Me and Tahlia
are going to get on fabulous.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.267
We are both wearing
leopard-print.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.567
Tahlia, come here! Initiation!
You've gotta do an oyster!

11:10.633 --> 11:12.400
Open wide, take it in.

11:12.467 --> 11:15.100
(Chloe) Oh, this is...
You can't, that's cruel!

11:16.167 --> 11:17.833
This what they eat in here?

11:17.900 --> 11:20.533
Oh, that's absolutely
fucking rotten!

11:20.600 --> 11:23.100
Sorry, I just wanted
to watch someone do that.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.000
I think we've partied together.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.967
Yes, we have.
I recognise your face.

11:29.033 --> 11:31.133
Are you single?
Yes, I'm single.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.833
Been single for about four
months.
I'm ready to go out and crack
on.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.367
Bethan's single!
We're gonna wingwoman each
other.

11:38.433 --> 11:40.900
Me and the new girl, Tahlia,
are both single.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.367
And she seems cool. This has
got fun written all over it.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.300
You seem very calm.
Yeah, you are!

11:46.367 --> 11:47.733
I'm quite a chill person.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.200
This makes sense. The reason
we've got caviar and oysters,

11:51.267 --> 11:52.867
you're posh, aren't you?

11:52.933 --> 11:54.867
No, I'm a thug. I'm from
Newcastle.

11:54.933 --> 11:56.667
You can be posh from Newcastle!

11:56.733 --> 11:58.600
Everyone is being really nice.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.567
I just hope that it lasts.

12:00.633 --> 12:03.600
I'm posh.
(Sophie) You're common as muck,
you!

12:03.667 --> 12:05.467
Try and tell us you're posh?

12:06.467 --> 12:07.533
Oi-oi!
Hi!

12:07.600 --> 12:09.133
'There's a new boy!'
Yes!

12:10.333 --> 12:12.567
Hot tub party!

12:12.633 --> 12:15.033
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:17.000 --> 12:17.200
.

12:19.700 --> 12:19.900
.

12:30.433 --> 12:32.867
You know what?
We'll all get periods in sync.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.033
I know!
Yous, I'm so buzzing.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.400
Oh, my God!
I'm buzzing with this room!

12:37.467 --> 12:39.667
'Bethan and Tahlia
joined the family.'

12:39.733 --> 12:42.933
I wanna make sure these girls
are gonna feel comfortable

12:43.000 --> 12:47.033
and enjoy the experience,
because
this house is a one to remember.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.100
Be yourselves, like...
It can be intimidating.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.700
Don't ever feel like
you can't say something.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.600
And yous will have the best
time.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.633
This is a good choice.
I think this is a good choice.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.933
I'm excited.
I think it's a fun one.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.333
This is weird, isn't it?

13:03.400 --> 13:07.400
Obviously, we don't have a
clue...
anyone that could be coming out.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.633
It's all changed. I'm now
single,
and we've got new people.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.200
'We must be getting boys
at some point.'

13:13.267 --> 13:15.433
I'm nervous and excited
at the same time.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.833
It's so weird coming in this
house
without a boyfriend,

13:18.900 --> 13:22.400
cos every time I've come in,
it's been like a safety blanket.

13:22.467 --> 13:25.733
Cos I know that I'm gonna go on
a night out and not do anything.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.900
I'm gonna have fun.

13:26.967 --> 13:30.100
I don't have that safety any
more.
You're in the unknown.

13:30.167 --> 13:31.967
What's gonna happen?
Yeah.

13:32.033 --> 13:35.767
I didn't realise how worried
Nathan was about being single.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.667
It is really playing on his
mind.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.667
When's the last time you had
sex?

13:39.733 --> 13:41.833
With my ex-boyfriend.
Shut up.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.533
How long ago?
Two days before he broke up with
me.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.067
That was?
Five months ago.

13:46.133 --> 13:50.000
Five months? I thought
Ivy cock-blocking me was bad,

13:50.067 --> 13:52.133
but that is something else.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.300
Your balls must be fucking huge.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.700
I've seen them. They're big
anyway.
I've had a lot of wanks.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.633
Right, I think we should get
ready.
Come on.

14:04.867 --> 14:08.933
The mood in the house is pure
mint,
and I am loving our girls.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.167
Let's get ready for our first
night,
and have a peeve! Whoo!

14:17.333 --> 14:19.000
Do you wanna feel my six-pack?

14:19.067 --> 14:22.233
You should show it off.
Go on. Put your hand underneath.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.300
Put your hand underneath my top.
No!

14:24.367 --> 14:26.933
Put your hand underneath my top.
Shirtlifter.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.333
(both laugh)

14:28.400 --> 14:30.067
You know what, I love Nathan,

14:30.133 --> 14:33.600
and if we end up being the only
two
lads in the house, I'll be
happy.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.367
You liked that, didn't you?
You dirty bastard.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.500
'My name's Beau. I'm a Geordie
boy
through and through.'

14:45.633 --> 14:48.667
I'm a little bit nervous,
but I can't wait to get in
there.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.600
(gasps)
'Please!'

14:53.667 --> 14:55.533
Please be a boy!

14:55.600 --> 14:57.433
Oi-oi!
Hi!

14:57.500 --> 14:59.267
Yes!
Who is it?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.467
Who is it?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.900
How are you doing? What's your
name?

15:02.967 --> 15:04.967
Beau, mate.
Nice to meet you!

15:05.033 --> 15:07.167
What's he like?
Ooh, he's fit!

15:07.233 --> 15:09.833
All right?
Yous, it's a boy! Hiya!

15:09.900 --> 15:13.200
This new lad's built
like a brick shithouse!

15:14.000 --> 15:16.133
What's your name?
Beau.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.400
All I can see is teeth, tan
and fucking tattoos.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.467
Hi. What's your name?
Beau.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.200
Beau? Is that your real name?

15:23.267 --> 15:26.433
There's a new boy. This could be
just what Nathan needs.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.600
How old are you, Beau?
25.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.233
Oh, my God.
He's canny fit, him, you know?

15:32.300 --> 15:35.133
You excited to go out?
Do you usually go out the town?

15:35.200 --> 15:36.967
I work in Wales, I live there.

15:37.033 --> 15:39.400
What do you do?
I'm a civil engineer.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.300
I've been living down in Wales
about three years.

15:42.367 --> 15:44.800
'Newcastle is the best night out
in the UK.'

15:44.867 --> 15:46.200
I'm glad to be back.

15:46.267 --> 15:49.367
So, are you single?
Aye, aye, aye. Oh, aye.

15:49.433 --> 15:53.767
God has answered all of my
prayers.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.667
He's beautiful.

15:55.733 --> 15:58.600
Are you, erm, straight, or...?
Straight, aye.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.633
Aye.
'He's straight.'

16:00.700 --> 16:02.200
(sighs)

16:03.567 --> 16:07.433
Tonight is family night, so
you've
gotta keep it in the family.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.200
If not...
I'm happy with that!

16:09.267 --> 16:11.333
Keeping it in the family
sounds good,

16:11.400 --> 16:13.633
cos the girls in here
are pretty fit.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.967
Cheers, everyone!

16:15.033 --> 16:18.000
To family! To your new family.
To newbies!

16:18.067 --> 16:21.200
We have no idea if any more
new people are coming in,

16:21.267 --> 16:23.467
but we cannot hang around
all night.

16:23.533 --> 16:27.567
We need to get out on the Toon
and show this lot how we party.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.067
After you, darling.
Don't you "darling" me!

16:40.700 --> 16:43.933
It's our first night back,
and we've got three new people.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.933
Let's have a night to remember.
To the first night!

16:47.000 --> 16:48.767
(cheering)
To the first night!

16:48.833 --> 16:50.900
To the first of many!

16:52.300 --> 16:55.033
'Everyone is in
unbelievable spirits.'

16:55.100 --> 16:57.133
I feel like this is gonna be
class.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.666
I haven't been out on the Toon
in ages. I'm having a class
time.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.233
Everyone seems sound.
I could have fun here.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.000
I wasn't sure what it was going
to
be like, going out single.

17:29.067 --> 17:31.567
I'm having fun,
and the fact we've got newbies

17:31.633 --> 17:33.233
is taking my mind off things.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.967
Me and Bethan are like
two radgie sisters,

17:57.033 --> 17:59.300
and her being in this house
means the world.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.267
Whoo!

18:21.500 --> 18:25.333
'It's our first night out. Chloe
and Bethan are all over each
other.'

18:25.400 --> 18:29.233
Normally, Chloe's doing this on
me.
I've been exchanged for Bethan!

18:34.933 --> 18:39.200
I'm nervous about coming in.
Bethan and Chloe are good
friends.

18:39.267 --> 18:40.800
But I'm having a good time,

18:40.867 --> 18:43.633
and there's room for one more
in this dance-off.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.333
Hey, hey, hey!

19:00.233 --> 19:02.733
Bethan reminds me
of a typical Geordie lass.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.333
I'm looking forward to seeing
what she's about.

19:17.267 --> 19:20.467
As well as being good to look
at,
Beau seems pretty funny.

19:20.533 --> 19:22.533
I think we're gonna get on
just fine.

19:24.533 --> 19:25.867
I'm loving being back,

19:25.933 --> 19:30.600
and it's mad seeing three new
family
members out partying with us.

19:30.667 --> 19:34.600
They're already fitting in so
well,
especially Bethan and Beau.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.467
They seem to be hitting it off.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.033
(cheering)
Yes!

19:40.100 --> 19:41.867
Shots!

19:43.900 --> 19:45.233
Come on, then!

19:47.100 --> 19:48.700
Cheers, everyone!

19:50.133 --> 19:51.700
Shit, I've spilled it...

19:51.767 --> 19:53.267
One, un...

19:54.733 --> 19:56.000
...deux.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.367
Trois!

19:58.300 --> 20:01.000
Call the cops,
I am off my fucking chops.

20:20.933 --> 20:24.100
Apart from that oyster,
me and Nathan haven't spoken.

20:24.167 --> 20:26.767
It's nice he's sat us down
for a heart-to-heart.

20:38.467 --> 20:41.933
I was in a relationship
that really messed with my head.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.400
'And I don't want that.
I want to be happy.'

20:44.467 --> 20:47.900
I'm all up for getting my
confidence
back and having a laugh.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.667
Me and Tahlia have already
got something in common.

20:54.733 --> 20:57.000
We both need to get over our
exes.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.733
Here's to single life, babe.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.067
'Coming with other newbies
is making the experience
easier.'

21:28.133 --> 21:30.467
Once I've met people,
everything's fine,

21:30.533 --> 21:34.767
but the meeting is a bit
nervous.
You want everyone to like you.

21:55.467 --> 21:57.100
(cheering)

21:58.233 --> 22:01.067
Our first night back with the
family
has been mental,

22:01.133 --> 22:03.967
but it's time to get back
and straight in the hot tub.

22:18.200 --> 22:22.300
Tonight has been shamazing.
Hot tub party!

22:22.367 --> 22:24.033
Get in the hot tub.

22:26.467 --> 22:28.967
Come on, Bethan. Now.

22:29.033 --> 22:30.633
I'm not doing it!

22:30.700 --> 22:34.667
Everyone's putting swimming gear
on.
You mad? I'm going in bollock
naked.

22:44.267 --> 22:48.033
Tahlia's got her tits out,
Beau's
got his dick and his balls out.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.867
It's like some kind of orgy.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.367
(shrieks)
What're you doing?

22:53.467 --> 22:56.767
Oh, my God, I just felt...
(screams)
Don't touch my cock.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.033
I'm trying to move around
this hot tub,

22:59.100 --> 23:01.300
and I'm sure I've just felt a
snake.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.400
Oh, shit.

23:04.733 --> 23:07.033
These newbies have been here
two minutes,

23:07.100 --> 23:09.833
and they're already
necking on all over the place.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.500
These are gonna fit right in.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.267
I'm literally nursing a semi-on
right now.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.800
Nathan, you're gay.

23:18.233 --> 23:22.367
Tonight has gone from good to
great.
I love this place.

23:22.433 --> 23:24.567
Nathan and Beau, neck on.

23:24.633 --> 23:27.500
Let's be honest. It was going to
happen eventually.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.767
Our first night back has been
mint.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.200
Everyone has got on swimmingly,

23:35.267 --> 23:37.700
and I've finally
got Chloe to myself in bed.

23:39.267 --> 23:43.067
And next to come on stage
is Chloe Ferry!

23:44.133 --> 23:45.800
(laughs)

23:51.567 --> 23:53.300
Knock, knock! It's me!

23:54.700 --> 23:56.867
I'm home!
I'm fucking buzzing!

23:56.933 --> 23:57.933
My God, hello!

23:58.000 --> 24:00.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:02.467 --> 24:02.667
.

24:05.200 --> 24:05.400
.

24:21.867 --> 24:23.833
'Last night was so much fun.'

24:23.900 --> 24:26.933
Usually, when I wake up at home,
I've got my mam in my room,

24:27.000 --> 24:30.600
whereas here, everyone's in
the same boat, all hungover,

24:30.667 --> 24:32.900
it's just lovely and peaceful.

24:32.967 --> 24:36.433
I'd like to start the morning
by formally apologising.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.367
I've weed on Chloe's bed.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.533
I'm really sorry for doing that.
It's embarrassing.

24:41.600 --> 24:46.500
Shock. Nathan has pissed the
bed.
Nothing ever changes.

24:46.567 --> 24:49.900
Just had a flashback of last
night.
Everyone was necking on...

24:49.967 --> 24:52.033
Did yous neck on?
Yeah, me and Bethan.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.667
Oh, we necked on.

24:53.733 --> 24:56.600
What do you think of Beau?
Do you fancy him?

24:56.667 --> 25:00.367
I do think he's fit, yeah,
but he's not my normal cup of
tea.

25:00.433 --> 25:03.133
But I like the fact
that he's covered in tattoos.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.900
That's my thing.
The tattoos.

25:04.967 --> 25:07.333
Head. To. Toe.
Head to toe.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.400
I've only been in this house
one night, but I do fancy him,

25:10.467 --> 25:13.000
and he might grow on us.
I'll see how it goes.

25:13.067 --> 25:14.600
What about this bed?

25:14.667 --> 25:17.900
I could probably sit here with
a hair dryer, but I don't know.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.367
Good morning, Beau!

25:21.433 --> 25:22.867
You remind me of a bogey.

25:22.933 --> 25:26.900
I'm so hungover. I couldn't have
asked for a better first night.

25:26.967 --> 25:30.433
What do you think of Bethan?
I don't know her well enough.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.700
To get feelings.
Is that your type?

25:32.767 --> 25:35.533
Aye, definitely my type.
Got a pulse, hasn't she?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.100
(laughter)

25:37.167 --> 25:39.133
No, I do think she's sound.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.733
Do you get feelings?
Have you been in love?

25:41.800 --> 25:45.767
Aye, course, 100%. But I've also
had my little heart broken.

25:45.833 --> 25:49.467
After the relationships I've
been
in, it is hard to let my guard
down,

25:49.533 --> 25:51.633
so I don't catch feelings that
easy.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.300
How'd it happen?
Well, it just didn't end well.

25:54.367 --> 25:57.700
You know what I mean?
And then... So, obviously...

25:57.767 --> 26:00.400
With that in mind,
I've got a bit of a wall up.

26:00.467 --> 26:03.600
So, what happened with yous?
Did you get, er...

26:03.667 --> 26:05.933
No... Had no fucking luck.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.533
I am missing Ivy,
but without her being here,

26:08.600 --> 26:12.367
I thought I'd be able to have
some
honky-honky with Sam last night.

26:12.433 --> 26:14.400
But I was way too drunk. Oops.

26:14.467 --> 26:16.233
Glad you didn't when I was in.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.767
You definitely watched.
You turned around.

26:18.833 --> 26:20.833
Like...
(laughter)

26:27.667 --> 26:29.533
My fucking hair's all over.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.333
This one?

26:33.700 --> 26:36.467
Oi-the-fucking-oi!
Hello, you!

26:36.533 --> 26:41.300
Knock, knock! It's me, Scotty T,
and his proper long D.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.867
Hello, you!
Oh, shock, it's a mess already.

26:43.933 --> 26:46.600
Scott's here!
Howay, get your arse downstairs!

26:46.667 --> 26:48.133
Right, go on. Let's go.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.967
Loads of stuff in the universe
baffles me.

26:51.033 --> 26:56.533
But one of them is, how the fuck
is
Scott still the boss? I miss
Anna.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
Good to see you.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.633
How you doing?

26:59.700 --> 27:04.267
So, we've got newbies in the
house.
The lad I know from town. He's
sound.

27:04.333 --> 27:07.067
But the girls?
I feel like I know them.
(laughs)

27:07.133 --> 27:09.833
Have a good night last night?
Yeah, it was good.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.500
Well, wind your necks in,
cos we're going to work today.

27:13.567 --> 27:17.400
So, you and Sophie are taking
all the newbies out to work.

27:17.467 --> 27:20.600
Yes! Our first job.
It'd better be a laugh, though.

27:20.667 --> 27:23.533
Get sorted.
We're on a tight schedule.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.533
It's time for me to seize the
day.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.333
Carpe day one.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.233
Howay then, let's get ready.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.967
Fair play to these radgies.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.900
They go to work on a banging
hangover. I need to man up.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.133
Right, see you later.
Have fun, buddy.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.500
Yous two, don't bond without me.

27:49.533 --> 27:51.500
Let's get your first trip to
work.

27:51.567 --> 27:54.400
(Sophie) 'I've seen these
newbies
on a night out.'

27:54.467 --> 27:57.100
Now I want to see
what they're like at work,

27:57.167 --> 28:00.967
and I am very intrigued to see
what Scott has got in store for
us.

28:01.033 --> 28:03.400
Oh, it's freezing!
Isn't it?

28:06.500 --> 28:09.333
I really want to know
what we're doing. I'm nervous.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.633
Nathan. You know when
you moved out with Craig?

28:15.700 --> 28:16.800
Mm-hmm.

28:17.733 --> 28:21.033
What did you do with all your
house stuff that you bought?

28:21.100 --> 28:24.533
Split it. Whatever he couldn't
take,
he gave to me.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
It's great having the newbies
here,

28:26.667 --> 28:29.900
but it's also good having time
so we can catch up properly.

28:29.967 --> 28:33.033
When he left, I went on, like,
as if I was in a movie.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.800
So, when he closed the door,

28:34.867 --> 28:37.767
I dropped to the floor
and sat for three hours crying.

28:37.833 --> 28:40.267
Honestly, why does it hurt that
much?

28:40.333 --> 28:43.600
Breaking up with my boyfriend
was the worst thing.

28:43.667 --> 28:47.833
It's so hard to let go. You
can't
just forget four years like
that.

28:47.900 --> 28:51.500
I feel you're not ready to move
on.
I think it's more of a case
of...

28:52.967 --> 28:55.467
If I'm gonna move on...
who do I move on to?

28:55.533 --> 28:57.767
And I'm not just gonna
move on to anyone.

28:57.833 --> 29:00.467
It needs to be the right person.
Know what I mean?

29:05.900 --> 29:08.000
Where the fuck are we?
I don't get it.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.900
There's planes!
No fucking way!

29:11.967 --> 29:14.833
Yes! Get me in here!
No fucking way!

29:14.900 --> 29:18.100
Nae way are we flying planes!
Nae way!

29:18.167 --> 29:21.333
What's up?
What the fuck is this?!

29:21.400 --> 29:24.400
How are you fucking feeling?!
Nervous.

29:24.467 --> 29:27.300
They all need to wind their
necks in
and do what I say.

29:27.367 --> 29:31.200
Otherwise Anna's gonna get her
fanny
in a big knot and chew my ear
off.

29:31.267 --> 29:35.167
What we're gonna do today
is have a look round Newcastle.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.633
(Sophie) What, in that?!
Aye.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.667
I don't even think that's safe.

29:39.733 --> 29:43.533
(Tahlia) Sam's face has gone
deathly white. (laughs)

29:46.667 --> 29:50.100
They'll be shitting themselves.
I am, and I'm not in it!

30:04.133 --> 30:08.600
'I'm impressed with work. I've
never
seen Newcastle from this high.'

30:30.333 --> 30:33.700
Being on this plane
is like being a rollercoaster.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.267
In Australia, if you looked to
your
left your could see the Gold
Coast,

30:47.333 --> 30:49.833
if you looked right,
you could see dolphins.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.800
We're in Newcastle in the plane,

30:51.867 --> 30:54.367
I can see a car factory
and the fucking A1.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.900
(exhales)

30:58.967 --> 31:02.133
These newbies have got off
lightly.
Today has been fun.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.267
Howay, then.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.933
I can't wait to get back
and tell Chloe I'm a pilot.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.833
(laughs) She'll believe you!

31:07.900 --> 31:10.300
The first day at work
has been amazing.

31:10.367 --> 31:12.467
I could do this every single
day.

31:24.433 --> 31:28.200
With everyone out at work,
this house feels empty and
quiet.

31:28.267 --> 31:29.867
When are they gonna get back?

31:35.100 --> 31:39.767
'Hi, my name's Nat. There's
nowhere
else I'd rather be than
Newcastle.'

31:39.833 --> 31:43.233
I've got friends, family here.
The whole place is fantastic.

31:45.967 --> 31:49.333
I'm gonna miss my girlfriend,
but I'm thinking, get in there,

31:49.400 --> 31:52.067
be my outgoing self,
and have some fun.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.000
Honey, I'm home!
Oh, my God!

31:58.067 --> 31:59.867
Oh, my God!

31:59.933 --> 32:03.567
I can't believe that Anna has
put
my mate Natalie in this house!

32:03.633 --> 32:05.100
I am fucking buzzing!

32:05.167 --> 32:06.533
No!
Yeah! (laughs)

32:06.600 --> 32:08.667
Oh, my God, hello!

32:08.733 --> 32:10.300
Oh, my God, Chloe!

32:10.367 --> 32:13.333
'Nathan is screaming my name.
What's going on?'

32:13.400 --> 32:14.633
God!

32:14.700 --> 32:16.800
Oh, my God! It's Natalie!

32:16.867 --> 32:19.333
What the hell?! What the hell?!

32:19.400 --> 32:21.900
It is impossible for me
to not know everyone.

32:21.967 --> 32:26.533
Can't go out four nights a week
and people not go, "Seen her."

32:26.600 --> 32:28.333
What the hell?
Are you buzzing?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.067
I am. Does it feel weird?
It does, yeah.

32:31.133 --> 32:33.867
Are you gonna stay in
the girls' room or the boys?

32:33.933 --> 32:35.667
The boys'. I've got a bird.
What?

32:35.733 --> 32:37.167
I've got a bird.
Have you?

32:37.233 --> 32:38.267
Since May, aye.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.667
The last thing on my mind
is pulling girls.

32:40.733 --> 32:43.667
All I wanna do is work hard,
but party harder.

32:43.733 --> 32:47.067
The girls' room is vile.
Why I wanna stay with the boys.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.667
I cannot wait for the others
to get back, especially Sophie.

32:50.733 --> 32:54.167
Cos Nat and Sophie are so close.
They will be fucking shocked!

32:54.233 --> 32:56.567
Do you want that bed?
I'll share with Beau.

32:56.633 --> 32:57.967
Yeah, I'll get in there.

32:58.033 --> 33:00.033
Shall me and Beau share a bed?
Do it.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.367
Let's see how long you can
hold a note. One, two, three...

33:07.433 --> 33:09.300
(sustains note)

33:10.367 --> 33:13.200
Ah! Ah! Ah!

33:13.267 --> 33:16.400
I'm blind! Why would you do
that?
That really bruised me.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.400
You were getting on my nerves.

33:20.633 --> 33:21.833
(gasps)

33:21.900 --> 33:24.933
Hello! Hi.
Hi.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.767
How was work?
Not gonna believe what we done.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.733
We went in planes, like...
We flew over Newcastle!

33:30.800 --> 33:34.533
Natalie's upstairs, and these
lot
are rhyming on about work.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.867
Shut up! I've got a surprise!

33:36.933 --> 33:40.167
While yous were away, erm...
we made yous a surprise.

33:40.233 --> 33:42.233
What is it?
Ta-da!

33:42.300 --> 33:44.000
(laughs)

33:44.067 --> 33:46.300
(cheering)

33:46.367 --> 33:50.300
Oh, my God! I am fucking
buzzing.

33:50.367 --> 33:54.967
This is my friend Natalie, and I
know she is perfect for this
house.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.333
You all right? Nice to meet you.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.967
Fucking hell, there's now four
of us newbies. We're
multiplying.

34:01.033 --> 34:03.633
So, everyone,
this is my friend Natalie.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.833
She's obviously a lesbian.
(laughs)

34:05.900 --> 34:10.033
Everybody else knows Nat.
I don't, but let's get upstairs,

34:10.100 --> 34:12.900
get ready for tonight.
It's gonna be mint.

34:17.300 --> 34:21.632
We've all been out with Natalie
before, and we all know she's
wild.

34:21.699 --> 34:24.300
Let's get her so drunk.
This is her first night,

34:24.367 --> 34:27.667
so we need to make sure it's
like ours was. We had a class
time.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.867
'Today has been a lot of fun.'

34:29.933 --> 34:33.199
Now, I've got my friend Natalie
staying in the house.

34:33.266 --> 34:36.233
This makes me so excited
for tonight.

34:39.867 --> 34:41.833
(Nathan) Try and kick it in my
face.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.632
Happily.
I will fucking happily do that.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.033
(laughter)

34:46.100 --> 34:47.632
No, didn't like that.

34:47.699 --> 34:51.167
Sam, man! Stop it now!
I don't want to play any more!

34:54.132 --> 34:56.900
So, Nat, what is your intention
for tonight?

34:56.967 --> 35:00.167
A mad one. I'm the trying
to get everyone to do the conga,

35:00.233 --> 35:02.333
encourage some person
to do the limbo.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.167
That's your goal, the conga?
Get the conga going.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.100
Get the conga going round the
loo.

35:07.167 --> 35:09.400
I'm loving being with the boys,

35:09.467 --> 35:12.667
but now, I want to get out there
and get this party started.

35:12.733 --> 35:15.400
Natalie,
I'm buzzing you've come in the
house.

35:15.467 --> 35:17.633
Last night was good.
It was really good.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.967
But tonight should be better!

35:20.033 --> 35:24.033
Let's go out, do what we do
best,
and get drunk!

35:24.100 --> 35:25.567
To the team!

35:29.067 --> 35:31.533
I'm a little bit fucking horny!

35:31.600 --> 35:32.867
I'm on one tonight.

35:32.933 --> 35:35.167
I just hope that he's all right.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.667
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:39.967 --> 35:40.167
.

35:42.667 --> 35:42.867
.

35:56.233 --> 35:59.833
(Chloe) 'I am well up for
tonight.
It's Natalie's first night.'

35:59.900 --> 36:02.267
Let's get mortal!

36:02.333 --> 36:04.000
(cheering)

36:11.200 --> 36:14.667
I'm so excited to have Nat here.
I'm on one tonight.

36:27.033 --> 36:30.733
It's nice spending time with
Nathan.
Good banter, and he can drink.

36:43.267 --> 36:46.800
I'm just so happy to see that
Natalie is fitting in perfectly.

36:46.867 --> 36:48.567
She is letting her hair down.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.033
I am quite a confident girl,

36:59.100 --> 37:01.800
and coming in this house,
I was shitting myself.

37:01.867 --> 37:04.867
Having Sophie and Nathan here
made us feel a lot better.

37:10.067 --> 37:12.767
Natalie is usually
the life and soul of the party,

37:12.833 --> 37:16.000
so tonight, I can't wait to see
what she gets up to.

37:39.367 --> 37:43.333
I'm pretty mortal,
but my eyes do not deceive me.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.233
'Bethan and Beau seem to be
getting pretty cosy.'

38:08.267 --> 38:11.833
Beau, if I can give you
any type of advice, pick one
girl.

38:29.567 --> 38:32.400
Beau's just come over,
and told us I'm looking lush.

38:32.467 --> 38:35.433
It's nice getting a compliment
off a good-looking lad.

38:47.300 --> 38:50.833
Still getting to know everyone.
This is my first chat with
Tahlia

38:50.900 --> 38:52.400
and she is pretty cool.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.000
Do the limbo!

39:10.433 --> 39:12.900
Tonight is hilarious.
We're doing limbo,

39:12.967 --> 39:15.767
we're dancing on the floor...
I love this lot.

39:29.233 --> 39:33.633
Oh... Nathan is so drunk
tonight.
I just hope that he's all right.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.767
I've been trying to
put on a brave face,

39:47.833 --> 39:50.200
but I can't stop
thinking about my ex.

39:50.267 --> 39:52.933
Cos I'm finding it very hard
to get over him.

39:56.933 --> 39:59.767
I know what it's like,
getting over an ex.

39:59.833 --> 40:03.267
He's gonna go through ups and
downs.
We've all gotta be there.

40:12.467 --> 40:14.833
We're all in the club,
having a good time.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.933
but me and Bethan
are drunk as skunks.

40:20.033 --> 40:22.200
Why the fuck not? Party to the
max!

40:22.267 --> 40:23.367
(laughs)

40:44.167 --> 40:48.233
Erm, hello? These newbies are
pure
radge. I'm a little bit horny!

40:53.967 --> 40:56.300
I've been on many a night out
with Nathan,

40:56.367 --> 40:58.167
and I've seen him this smashed.

40:58.233 --> 41:00.900
I know he's still suffering
from the break-up.

41:00.967 --> 41:03.067
'I really need to keep
an eye on him.'

41:09.700 --> 41:13.700
We have had a wicked night as a
squad of eight. Everyone is
mortal.

41:13.767 --> 41:16.233
Let's get home
before anything goes tits-up.

41:20.033 --> 41:21.833
(whoops)

41:21.900 --> 41:23.800
Sam, get in there now.

41:31.433 --> 41:33.233
Shit the fucking bed...

41:33.300 --> 41:36.800
We've just arrived back.
Everyone's in high spirits.

41:36.867 --> 41:37.933
'Let's eat kebab!'

41:38.000 --> 41:41.300
Nathan! The door's this way!

41:41.367 --> 41:43.067
Hello...

41:43.133 --> 41:45.400
Chloe! Oh...

41:46.800 --> 41:49.500
'We've got home,
and all the alcohol has hit me.'

41:49.567 --> 41:52.833
Being this drunk is making me
feel emotionally vulnerable.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.667
Nathan! It's snowing!

41:59.733 --> 42:01.433
Come on, Nathan.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.267
It's snowing, bitch!

42:07.400 --> 42:09.333
Tonight has actually been
amazing.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.133
But I'm ready to do it
all over again tomorrow!

42:13.200 --> 42:15.100
Goodnight, Sam.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.467
Goodnight, darlings.

42:22.600 --> 42:26.067
I know Nathan's had a really
rough
break-up with his ex,

42:26.133 --> 42:29.833
but this is the first time I've
ever
seen Nathan cry. It's not nice.

42:33.367 --> 42:36.867
It's been five months.
Like, get the fuck over it.

42:36.933 --> 42:39.033
Do you think that's what it is?
Yeah.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.133
(sighs)

42:42.200 --> 42:45.033
Get your shit together,
show me your fine arse,

42:45.100 --> 42:48.867
get your fucking jazzy clothes
on,
and watch wuh go out the next
time.

42:48.933 --> 42:52.600
Cos we're not gonna cry. We're
gonna
celebrate how happy you are.

42:52.667 --> 42:55.000
Cos being single's not a bad
thing.

42:55.067 --> 42:57.367
'I really hope Nathan will be
OK.'

42:57.433 --> 42:59.100
I will 100% be there for him.

42:59.167 --> 43:02.100
I was with him
for such a long time. It's
like...

43:03.400 --> 43:04.733
(sighs)

43:04.800 --> 43:07.833
I got you. I got you.

43:07.900 --> 43:09.100
Love you.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.800
(horn blares)
Beep fucking beep.

43:16.867 --> 43:19.133
This is gonna be
your home away from home.

43:19.200 --> 43:22.400
(cheering)
House party, bitches!

43:23.367 --> 43:26.433
Maybe being single
isn't as bad as I thought.

43:27.467 --> 43:30.333
The more time I spend with him,
the more I fancy the lad.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.000
Tahlia and Beau, neck on.
What the fuck?

43:33.067 --> 43:35.200
Girls always blame the other
girl.

43:35.267 --> 43:37.433
He goes and fucks this all up.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.233
(cheering)
He is a bit of me.

43:41.067 --> 43:42.400
What've I done, man?

43:42.467 --> 43:43.967
It's kicking off.

43:44.033 --> 43:46.533
Do you fancy him?!
Who are you shouting at?!

44:13.433 --> 44:13.633
.
