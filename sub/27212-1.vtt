00:17.887 --> 00:18.888
Daisy?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.462
Hurry up Rose

01:17.990 --> 01:19.383
Lizzy?

01:55.593 --> 01:58.161
Gorge there, Sammy. Oh.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.311
Go easy on the booze
this weekend.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.923
And, remember to keep your
neoliberal views to yourself.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.751
I don't want another
immigration argument.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.275
When did I become a neoliberal?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.451
I don't even know
what that means.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.540
Try not to bring up
her father either.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.021
And, how would that
conversation start?

02:32.064 --> 02:33.849
Just saying, be sensitive.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.157
It's her first Christmas
as an orphan.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.681
I don't think we'll be
toasting that over the turkey.

03:18.459 --> 03:21.679
He's like Jackie bloody Stewart
on those country roads, isn't he?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.377
We thought you'd overtaken us.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.248
I'm carrying a
heavy load, Anita.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.511
You should see what
I've got in the trunk.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.165
Please, no.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.951
Put it away, Samantha. We won't
be breathing radiation out here.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.605
Yeah, that's what I feared.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.694
You're lucky if we
have running water.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.479
You made it.

03:38.827 --> 03:39.871
There she is.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.265
Namaste, McKenzie.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.353
You need a hand?

03:45.268 --> 03:46.530
New wheels, Anita?

03:46.965 --> 03:49.316
Yes. I think it's ridiculous.

03:49.577 --> 03:52.232
Oh, I don't know.
I think it's pretty cool.

03:52.493 --> 03:53.711
Thank you, McKenzie.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.236
I see you've still got the
same old plates then, Jo.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.500
I'm flogging them on eBay if
you know anyone interested.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.329
No, but if I meet Cath
I'll let her know.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.506
Gosh, it's much colder up here.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.249
Don't worry, darles.
We brought tons of Bolli.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.252
Want to give me a hand, Marcus?

04:12.556 --> 04:14.036
Let the ladies get inside.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.255
All right.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.344
Take that, will you?

04:17.387 --> 04:18.432
Yes.

04:20.084 --> 04:22.914
Ever experienced an erection
from dairy before, Marcus?

04:26.135 --> 04:28.703
I guarantee you will before the
weekend is out, my man.

04:34.665 --> 04:35.840
It's cozy.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.016
Yeah. Will be when I
get the fire going.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.018
Who booked this place?

04:40.062 --> 04:41.063
Guilty.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.934
Ah. Great, Kenz!

04:43.457 --> 04:44.588
Really cheap.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.198
It's not why I booked it.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.375
No, of course not.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.812
Just call me Miss Haversham.

04:52.683 --> 04:55.947
Anita, darling.

04:56.165 --> 04:59.603
Don't you look
fabulous! New weave.

04:59.647 --> 05:00.996
Yes, it's Peruvian.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.129
Gay men always
notice the intricacies of life.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.740
Dump your shit in the kitchen.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.656
Oh, Hugo, you remember?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.527
Of course Merry
Christmas, Malcolm.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.094
Marcus?

05:12.137 --> 05:17.447
Whatever. Samantha, darling.
Oh, don't you look sensual!

05:17.491 --> 05:19.841
Here, let me take this from you.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.017
Oh, you didn't tell
us Hugo was coming.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.845
Well, he's here now.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.063
Briefly.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.544
Hello, young man.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.374
That's an awful lot of
fat you have there.

05:31.896 --> 05:35.552
Two of my best sweet
and curvies, Hugo.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.859
I'll make us all
mimosas, shall I?

05:38.076 --> 05:40.383
Oh, Sammy, you read my mind.

05:40.427 --> 05:44.387
No fruit in mine I'm on a
strict zero sugar intake policy.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.738
How are you holding up, Bab?

05:48.086 --> 05:50.567
Yeah, I'm all right.
You know what Hugo's like.

05:50.611 --> 05:53.048
He's been keeping me on
my toes since we arrived.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.354
Let's get you a drink.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.924
Well, that little bugger can go for a
start. Set me off good and proper.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.491
Fuck, yeah.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.363
Buttons.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.244
Like a slab of concrete.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.030
Right. I'll go to the car then.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.163
No, you can sleep on the floor.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.209
I meant for the pillows.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.865
Look, let's not start.
We've only just got here.

06:28.039 --> 06:31.173
Are you planning on being
inebriated the entire weekend?

06:31.478 --> 06:34.350
It's called getting
into the spirit.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.439
At least one of us has to.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.857
Oooh. Well done, Sammy.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.294
Anita?

07:07.775 --> 07:10.560
Oh, Marcus, do you want to
give me a hand with this?

07:10.604 --> 07:12.301
Oh, yeah, all right.

07:21.745 --> 07:28.012
And bed linen clearly
from a care ward.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.235
All right, isn't it?

07:35.150 --> 07:36.281
Alcohol-free.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.067
Is she taking the absolute piss?

07:39.197 --> 07:42.070
Check this out, babe.

07:42.679 --> 07:43.854
What the hell was that?

07:45.639 --> 07:47.379
Oh well, that's just
great, isn't it?

07:47.423 --> 07:50.295
Right. Well, I'll
leave you both to it.

07:51.862 --> 07:54.038
Cheap bloody pine
is what it is, Sam.

07:55.126 --> 07:58.042
Bed - defective.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.481
Oh, we'll just have to
cuddle up on the sofa, Bab.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.885
Are you going to
play nice tonight?

08:15.364 --> 08:18.062
If you're referring to
that behemoth upstairs,

08:18.672 --> 08:19.760
I will try.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.895
Well, she's fucked the bed,
so what's to drink?

08:24.939 --> 08:26.549
Sounds like you got off lightly.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.550
Punch?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.596
No, I'll stick to fizz, Babes.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.600
It's good seeing you again, Samantha.
Last time was at the La Croix event, yes?

08:33.774 --> 08:36.167
Oh, my Christ,
I nearly passed out, didn't I?

08:36.385 --> 08:39.388
I felt so trapped in the crowd, I
got myself in a right old state.

08:39.431 --> 08:42.522
But the crowd at Gautier
was like smelling salts.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.481
Totally saved me from
going on.

08:46.134 --> 08:49.224
Anyway, you've had your
chin done, haven't ya?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.705
You astute fucker.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.010
Uplift?

08:53.054 --> 08:55.186
Sub-pectoral augmentation.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.840
Behind the glands?

08:57.014 --> 08:58.538
You can't tell. Have a feel.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.278
Ah?

09:02.890 --> 09:04.021
Uh.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.545
- Mmm.
- Mmm

09:05.980 --> 09:07.547
Yeah, really subtle.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.212
This is a lovely
shade, Samantha.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.171
You sure I'm okay using it?

09:24.781 --> 09:26.827
Positive, Babes. I was going
to bin it. I'm into nudes now.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.481
It's almost a nod to
our Nordic ancestors.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.353
Spruce and greenery.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.400
Shaman and desert dwellers
were mostly likely my ancestors.

09:36.271 --> 09:40.884
And the closest they got to Europe was
the Dutch Jumbee coming after them.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.322
Where's your glass, Anita?
Let's get you a top-up.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.238
Why don't you pour her some of that
carpet cleaner she brought with her?

09:47.282 --> 09:49.632
I've been vehemently
teetotal for three years now.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.113
How's the practice doing, Nita?

09:52.461 --> 09:55.856
Very well. Kept hold of
my clients at least.

09:56.552 --> 10:00.512
In regression, you're actually recalling
previous times on this earth,

10:00.991 --> 10:03.341
sometimes not even from this
planet at all actually.

10:03.951 --> 10:07.911
Of course, you can't deal with every
past life in one session it takes time.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.392
Fascinating stuff, that.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.568
And, what about Jumbee?

10:14.483 --> 10:18.182
Dark, shadowy figures
from the spirit world.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.186
Shits me up, that, Nita.
I can't lie to you.

10:22.796 --> 10:27.148
Our culture has an array of mystical
practices and healing modalities.

10:27.322 --> 10:30.717
Clearly, I'm continuing
that ancestral line.

10:32.327 --> 10:35.591
Great! Who's for a bit
of nutty cheddar?

10:36.070 --> 10:40.552
Marcus? I've brought old Katherine
and some Rachel too if you'd prefer.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.771
Sorry?

10:42.250 --> 10:44.078
Oh, she names them
after her exes.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.775
At least she doesn't
have tattoos.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.431
No, I'm fine, thanks, Jo. I'm going
to stick with the liquid stuff.

10:49.953 --> 10:54.479
You sure? Blodwyn was a
runner-up at Nantwich in 2012.

10:55.480 --> 11:00.747
It's got a sticky exterior,
yet a beautiful floral taste.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.575
Would go great with
what's that you're drinking?

11:04.011 --> 11:05.012
Pernod.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.754
Oh. Maybe not.

11:09.494 --> 11:12.628
So, what's the gossip, McKenzie?
Anyone interesting on the horizon?

11:13.324 --> 11:16.676
No, I'm just focusing on
myself for the time being,

11:16.806 --> 11:19.069
doing a bit of personal growth.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.682
The question is: who or what
will she be doing next?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.596
Hugo, what do you know?

11:24.640 --> 11:26.729
Only that there's a
smorgasbord of contenders.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.992
No, there's not.
There's really not.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.647
We've got a Scandi theme
going on here, haven't we?

11:31.908 --> 11:35.607
All we need now is a plate of
rollmops and half a pint of mead.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.569
Still keep in touch with Matteo, do
you, Samantha? I always liked him.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.310
Have you been nosing
at my screen?

11:42.614 --> 11:44.704
Yes. What is that
you're fingering away at?

11:45.356 --> 11:49.230
Well, as some of you know, I've had
a bit of a life overhaul recently.

11:49.752 --> 11:55.062
I finally quit that dingy haberdashery,
what with Jo's well, issue.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.890
Yes, must be traumatic.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.067
And, I've given up on men,

12:00.284 --> 12:04.288
thanks to Kenz for introducing me
to this wonderful human being.

12:04.462 --> 12:09.816
And so, I've decided
to become a novel-writer.

12:10.817 --> 12:16.257
Oh, that's fantastic. Taking control
of your life. Good for you, Samantha.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.564
Yeah, got a bit of a J K Rowling
thing going on, haven't I?

12:19.608 --> 12:22.176
The book is all about
my life up to this point.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.135
So, more in the vein
of E. L. James, then?

12:25.396 --> 12:26.484
Who's he, babe?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.051
No, never mind.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.445
Jo's been a real
rock through it all.

12:30.575 --> 12:31.185
Ayers Rock.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.274
You've been beavering
away for weeks.

12:33.317 --> 12:34.710
Never stops.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.669
Does this little
pamphlet have a title?

12:39.106 --> 12:40.107
Jumping Ship.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.151
Jumping Ship.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.067
Oh, Christ.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.245
Wow.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.639
I see what you've done there.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.642
I'm gathering more
material all the time.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.166
Well, if it's sex-fuelled
tales you're after,

12:56.210 --> 12:58.473
you won't be getting
anything from me right now.

12:58.865 --> 13:03.391
My attention is purely on
imperial LGBT propaganda.

13:03.434 --> 13:07.395
Yawn, here we go again the queen
of Sochi rears her ugly head.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.050
There's only one
queen here, Hugo.

13:10.485 --> 13:17.231
And, I'm not anti-gay, but this culture
being pushed by mainstream is bollocks.

13:17.448 --> 13:21.844
There's a real agenda dictating who
we should be and what we should say,

13:21.888 --> 13:23.933
and I just don't go
along with that.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.979
I mean, zoom back a bit.

13:26.240 --> 13:32.376
Mainstream pushes this transgender
pan-binary shit, and it's fake.

13:32.550 --> 13:36.163
It's false. It's culture creation,
and it's set up to destroy us.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.774
Mainstream doesn't
give a fuck about us.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.820
You should put
that in your book.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.126
But don't you think those
issues are important?

13:43.300 --> 13:47.870
Well, look, if it's on the front
pages, it's all just fear and control,

13:48.131 --> 13:51.047
a distraction from the real
facts about who we are.

13:51.613 --> 13:54.616
We all have a masculine
and a feminine energy.

13:54.659 --> 13:55.835
Speak for yourself.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.623
Sacred aspects of gender, and mainstream
are destroying this by controlling

14:01.666 --> 14:05.932
our thinking, and then all that does is
leave us with depression and loneliness.

14:09.196 --> 14:13.635
I was thinking more along the lines of
tit clamps and butt plugs, to be honest.

14:14.157 --> 14:17.117
I think I will have some of
that cheese, actually, Jo.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.685
Oooh, right you are. Let's gather
some logs while we're out, eh?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.383
Oh, right.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.038
If you're so inquisitive
and open-minded,

14:25.081 --> 14:28.302
why don't we see what sordid
past lives you're hiding, mmm?

14:28.345 --> 14:30.347
Anita, do your voodoo on her.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.914
It's not voodoo.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.873
Yeah, go on, Kenz,
it'll be a laugh.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.093
Could be interesting.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.902
Find yourself in a
comfortable position.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.428
Your body's sinking into
the sofa beneath you.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.562
Take three deep breaths

15:17.699 --> 15:18.874
and let go.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.532
Trust your first impression,

15:25.533 --> 15:27.274
and look around you.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.757
What do you see?

15:36.674 --> 15:37.762
I see.

15:40.809 --> 15:44.030
Hugo laughing at me.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.163
Anita, I didn't say
a fucking word, I swear.

15:47.207 --> 15:51.820
I can feel the judgment.
It's palpable.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.040
I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.302
Why?

15:55.345 --> 15:57.782
Well, it's funny. It's
just a bit of fun.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.092
You're a fucking nightmare.

16:22.546 --> 16:27.334
Before you tuck into that pile of lard,
I want to give you your presents now.

16:27.377 --> 16:30.163
Surely we aren't gifting
until tomorrow?

16:30.206 --> 16:32.469
Hugo's actually got a
flight to catch first thing.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.819
- That's a shame.
- It's kind of a big business deal,

16:34.863 --> 16:36.212
but I won't go into it just yet.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.561
Oh, come on. Do tell.

16:37.605 --> 16:38.736
Have you booked your taxi?

16:38.780 --> 16:39.999
Yes, yes.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.003
Six days in Barcelona pitching
a new concept to Tom Ford.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.832
Then, I'm just going to shop
and fuck the rest of the time.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.399
Oh, it sounds ideal.

16:49.443 --> 16:54.578
Backtrack. So, I'm in the
dark room of union. It's 2 am.

16:54.752 --> 16:58.408
I'm bollock naked, with a cocktail
in one hand and a cock in the other.

16:58.887 --> 17:02.369
Before I know it,
a Greek Adonis named Costas,

17:02.543 --> 17:04.632
wearing only a pair
of workman's boots,

17:04.675 --> 17:08.156
strolls over to me and starts giving
it hell for leather from my behind.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.769
All the while, I'm worried
about the mess my new McQueen

17:11.813 --> 17:14.598
contrasting pants are going to
be in when all of this is over.

17:14.642 --> 17:18.385
Then suddenly, a
lightbulb goes on.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.866
Metaphoric vehicles.
Okay, you may open away.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.314
Pants?

17:34.357 --> 17:39.058
Not just any pants. Highly
absorbent magnetic lingerie.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.321
Prototypes, of course,
but you get the idea.

17:41.364 --> 17:45.890
Each pair lined with a highly
absorbent hygienic material

17:46.065 --> 17:51.113
so that no matter where you are, day or
night, you can simply pop them open,

17:51.418 --> 17:56.510
have a bit of fun, snap them close,
and then get on with whatever.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.381
Oooh, takes the
hassle out of it.

17:58.425 --> 18:02.255
Exactly. The brand is
called Why Hide?

18:03.038 --> 18:07.912
because why hide from your
sexuality or your sex, right?

18:08.522 --> 18:12.526
And, we're supposed
to try these on, are we?

18:12.569 --> 18:13.744
Absolutely.

18:13.788 --> 18:14.919
Damn right.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.331
Oh God, I don't know about

18:35.375 --> 18:38.160
Give me a twirl, you
chocolate goddess.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.293
Come on.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.643
Oh, yeah.

18:43.426 --> 18:48.301
Oh, yeah. Don't be shy, guys.
Anita's nailing it in here.

18:48.475 --> 18:54.350
Christ, give me another shot and
we can re-enact The Accused. Yes.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.006
Cuff me, bitch.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.356
Show me the goods.

19:01.009 --> 19:05.883
Oh. Love the lens,
because it's loving you.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.366
Oh yes. Oh.

19:12.368 --> 19:17.199
Right, come on, Marcus.

19:17.243 --> 19:20.202
Don't be shy. You're
spearheading it for the heteros.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.163
Show us those Y chromosomes.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.687
Oh dear God.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.385
Oh, yeah, baby.

19:33.868 --> 19:38.612
Whe-hey. Get a load
of this, darlings.

19:39.656 --> 19:43.921
Okay. Think of greasy
engines and Jodie Foster.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.364
And, the piece de resistance.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.631
Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.981
It's like a Basset Hound
has died on your chest.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.461
Where's McKenzie?

20:01.591 --> 20:04.594
Wait. Who-ho-hoa.

20:07.771 --> 20:08.946
Oh.

20:18.478 --> 20:22.743
You fucking minx.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.399
Well, this is
humiliating, isn't it?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.445
It looked a lot more
substantial in the box.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.796
I defy you to wear plaid again.

20:34.145 --> 20:37.540
You're going to put my under on.
In fact, you all are.

20:38.976 --> 20:41.936
This is about sexual
expression, yeah?

20:42.066 --> 20:47.724
Inclusivity being and doing
what you feel without barriers.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.291
Get together.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.036
Gorgeous.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.560
Right, we're going to
need a lot more booze.

21:34.554 --> 21:37.470
I just went and
puked in my fondue.

21:57.968 --> 22:02.930
I think I know that
I just got off with Anita.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.976
I'm a sexual warrior.

22:09.110 --> 22:16.944
Bastet, Pathos, Rati,
I beseech you.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.426
Someone clearly spiked
that bitch's wine.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.994
I'm so glad you're here.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.468
Cheers.

23:02.511 --> 23:03.512
Cheers.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.039
Oh God.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.127
Ah.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.918
I know you've avoided
talking about it all day,

23:20.399 --> 23:22.792
but at least your
father loved you.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.583
If we don't have partners
by the time we're 40,

23:32.498 --> 23:37.590
let's buy houses next door to each other
so we can still hang out all the time,

23:39.287 --> 23:42.943
and still go off gallivanting to
Sitges when we're old and saggy,

23:43.813 --> 23:46.425
and share Ocado
deliveries every Wednesday.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.514
Deal?

23:49.515 --> 23:50.603
Yeah.

23:53.649 --> 23:57.958
And, if your career belly flops
in a mammoth Jo-like fashion,

23:58.001 --> 24:00.090
you can always be my
Filipina housemaid.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.178
Oh.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.009
Yeah.

24:12.276 --> 24:16.455
You know, you're really getting
your shit together, aren't you?

24:18.282 --> 24:21.677
Too many sugar daddies
make Hugo a dull boy.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.853
You're standing on
your own two feet.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.552
Might make your old mum retard.

24:30.120 --> 24:34.385
Right. Definitely
time for sleep.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.736
Oh, have a fag with me first.

24:38.564 --> 24:42.002
Mmm-hmm. I feel sick. But I'll
see you when you get back.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.438
Whatever, darling.

25:05.329 --> 25:08.985
I heard the bells
on Christmas Day.

25:35.534 --> 25:39.189
The world revolved
from night to day.

25:41.714 --> 25:42.845
Hey.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.197
Fuck.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.072
Hey, Mally?

25:52.246 --> 25:56.555
What are you do do you
need a hand with your wood?

25:57.251 --> 25:59.079
I've got nothing better to do.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.389
Fuck me. This was a mistake.

27:21.509 --> 27:25.295
Oh, Jo is going to
have a seizure.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.036
Yeah, you did that.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.168
Shit.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.518
You scuttled off
shortly afterwards.

27:39.527 --> 27:42.443
Are you having a bloody laugh?

27:42.486 --> 27:43.923
Merry Christmas.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.274
Oh, give me a tea, Kenz.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.669
Oh.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.159
Had a party last night.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.031
More like a bloody sacrifice.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.381
I hope that's okay.
We'll clean everything up.

28:07.424 --> 28:10.601
Ah, it's all right.
Squeeze it all in while you can.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.734
Life's over before you know it.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.522
I was up to all somewhat
out here when I was a lad.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.135
You're John McKenzie's daughter

28:22.483 --> 28:25.878
the one who Rose, isn't it?

28:26.356 --> 28:28.228
Yeah. Long time ago.

28:28.402 --> 28:29.751
Are you keeping all right?

28:30.447 --> 28:33.276
Awful business when a
kiddie disappears.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.542
I could hardly tell you two
apart. Has there been any?

28:38.586 --> 28:40.457
He died two months ago.

28:42.546 --> 28:47.377
Oh, grief is a funny old thing.

28:48.204 --> 28:51.991
Affects people in different ways
some not so much, and then others.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.822
Well, it's Christmas Day.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.868
Only come out here to check
if everything's all right, mmm?

28:59.912 --> 29:01.609
Bet you settled in nicely?

29:02.001 --> 29:03.219
Thanks for stopping by.

29:03.263 --> 29:06.657
Oh, no problem. Merry Christmas.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.848
So, there's something
you don't know?

29:59.275 --> 30:03.105
We've known each other since college, babe.
You've never said a word.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.631
There was an investigation.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.374
A missing person's enquiry.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.162
But no evidence of abduction.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.254
She just vanished.

31:17.701 --> 31:20.095
Daisy was my twin.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.839
She was just two
hours older than me.

31:26.667 --> 31:29.713
I always hated the floral names.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.155
I don't think my mum
ever got over it.

31:38.287 --> 31:41.116
She just sat and stared
out the window all day.

31:46.643 --> 31:49.777
I think she died of a
broken heart, really,

31:51.474 --> 31:54.695
and not knowing
who's the killer.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.571
Then, when she died,

32:02.703 --> 32:05.749
Dad moved us,
and we never discussed it again.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.709
I wish you'd told me, Kenz.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.023
And, when Dad passed away,

32:19.067 --> 32:24.855
memories of it started to
resurface in fragments.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.642
I thought Hugo was leaving.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.472
He has.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.128
Well, he hasn't taken any
of his belongings with him.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.391
What?

32:41.829 --> 32:43.309
Hugo?

32:44.963 --> 32:45.964
Hugo?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.663
He's a real dick sometimes.
Why would he do this?

32:51.186 --> 32:52.492
There you go.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.147
Keep your energy up.

32:56.539 --> 32:57.671
Jo, we've literally been
outside for three minutes.

32:57.845 --> 33:00.108
A hungry worker is
useless out here.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.241
Hugo?

33:02.284 --> 33:03.416
Hugo?

33:14.122 --> 33:16.342
We should be out there
on foot with them.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.997
We'll cover more
ground in the car.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.567
Marcus?

33:32.445 --> 33:34.664
Oh no. Just no.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.145
Shitting titters.

33:37.972 --> 33:41.062
How many times did I say we
should have gone for the RAV4?

33:43.673 --> 33:45.719
Hugo?

33:48.765 --> 33:50.332
Hugo?

33:50.854 --> 33:52.856
There's no way he's
walked this far.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.381
You know what?

33:57.296 --> 34:03.389
The little twat is probably licking
Bacardi off a Spaniard's arse by now.

34:04.781 --> 34:06.131
Let's head back.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.831
Yeah. You're right. Let's go.

34:52.306 --> 34:53.395
Anything?

34:53.438 --> 34:55.658
No. Nothing.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.226
We didn't think you were back.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.794
The car cut out and
we had to leave it.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.144
I'll make us something
stronger, shall I?

35:03.536 --> 35:05.712
Guys. Get up here.

35:15.504 --> 35:18.116
The scrawny bastard
is still in here.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.988
Hugo, get out here now.

35:35.872 --> 35:39.049
Hugo. Look, if you
don't come out,

35:39.093 --> 35:43.402
we're all going to try on your Vivienne
Westwoods, and none of us have showered.

36:29.883 --> 36:33.843
What I didn't tell you
before is that I was with her.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.413
When Daisy disappeared,
I was there.

36:39.719 --> 36:40.807
We were 10.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.940
Oh, McKenzie.

36:44.506 --> 36:47.335
I tried to block it out
of my mind because

36:48.815 --> 36:50.338
I couldn't sleep at night.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.993
It just kept plaguing my mind.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.172
So, I never felt like
she was really gone,

36:59.173 --> 37:00.218
you know.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.613
And, over time,

37:06.224 --> 37:10.097
details of it faded until I can
barely remember it happening at all.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.884
Then, when Dad died,

37:17.278 --> 37:21.326
the memory crept back in.
It's more of a feeling.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.154
This place.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.113
What about it?

37:29.290 --> 37:32.554
I booked this place because it's
the closest to where it happened.

37:32.859 --> 37:36.079
We were stood right where she vanished
when we were searching for Hugo.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.255
I know it.

37:39.082 --> 37:40.388
And, this was hers.

37:41.433 --> 37:42.608
What are you saying?

37:42.651 --> 37:44.305
I don't know what I'm saying,

37:44.349 --> 37:46.655
but it's all a bit of a fucking
coincidence, don't you think?

37:46.699 --> 37:48.657
McKenzie, I can help you.

37:49.745 --> 37:53.053
It's a form of
hypnosis using psychometry.

37:53.706 --> 37:56.317
All objects hold a
form of memory.

37:57.666 --> 38:01.279
But I must warn you:
it's potentially traumatic.

38:03.803 --> 38:04.978
Anything.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.421
Close your eyes.

38:15.641 --> 38:19.906
I want you to take three slow,
deep breaths.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.565
And feel yourself, just relax.

38:27.348 --> 38:30.308
I don't like this. It's spooky.

38:30.569 --> 38:31.787
Sssh. Where have you been?

38:31.918 --> 38:33.180
Stuffing turkey.

38:33.223 --> 38:36.575
As I count down,
I want you to follow my voice.

38:38.664 --> 38:45.584
10, 9 You are in a safe place.

38:48.674 --> 38:54.157
8, 7, and 6...

38:56.551 --> 39:00.686
5 and 4

39:02.862 --> 39:05.430
In a moment I'm going
to touch your hand.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.347
When I do, you'll
go deeper still.

39:12.741 --> 39:19.487
3, 2, and 1

39:22.185 --> 39:27.495
You're now at the location and time
space of this important event.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.542
How old are you?

39:32.457 --> 39:33.806
10.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.375
Look down at your feet.
Can you see them?

39:38.071 --> 39:39.551
Yeah.

39:40.769 --> 39:45.557
I'm on my bike.
There's other children here.

39:46.427 --> 39:47.602
Friends.

39:51.127 --> 39:53.521
We shouldn't be here.
We'll be told off.

39:53.565 --> 39:58.091
Rose, where's Daisy?
Can you see her?

40:01.181 --> 40:02.965
No, she's gone.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.403
Where's she gone?

40:06.273 --> 40:07.535
I don't know.

40:09.145 --> 40:12.671
I want you to go back further,
just before she disappeared.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.414
Rewind time like a video tape.
Can you do that?

40:20.548 --> 40:22.637
I see her. She's there.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.117
Excellent.

40:25.814 --> 40:28.817
Now play the memory back with
all the details in sharp focus.

40:32.995 --> 40:36.564
She needed the toilet,
and we were too far from home.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.219
Then what happened?

40:40.873 --> 40:45.051
She went behind she
didn't come back.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.009
Behind where?

40:47.706 --> 40:49.316
A stone.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.405
Rose,

40:53.233 --> 40:58.238
I want you to start walking towards
the stone. Can you do that?

40:58.412 --> 41:00.240
I'm scared.

41:00.893 --> 41:03.678
You are completely
safe in this place.

41:04.723 --> 41:07.595
I want you to start
walking forwards.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.469
Is she there?

41:13.949 --> 41:15.951
I can't see behind.

41:16.517 --> 41:19.520
Give yourself permission
to look behind the stone.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.480
I don't want to.

41:23.568 --> 41:28.964
You are strong, fearless,
and completely safe.

41:30.662 --> 41:33.316
Look behind the stone.

41:37.407 --> 41:39.671
Christ on a bloody bike.

41:39.714 --> 41:42.500
God. He's relentless.

41:46.939 --> 41:49.419
Come on now, Hugo pack it in.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.378
Guys, look.

41:53.946 --> 41:55.774
Hell's fire.

42:01.867 --> 42:03.738
Fucking hell, Jo.

42:04.609 --> 42:06.654
I always come prepared.

42:07.568 --> 42:12.181
All right, fucktards.
Come on out!

42:29.329 --> 42:30.460
What happened?

42:31.636 --> 42:33.463
The car's been vandalized.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.770
Just give me a minute.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.032
Are you okay?

42:37.380 --> 42:38.817
It's not Hugo's style.

42:40.645 --> 42:42.342
I mean, he's an unscrupulous little
bitch, but he wouldn't do that.

42:42.516 --> 42:44.649
The man can't survive
under 20 degrees,

42:44.910 --> 42:48.043
let alone puncture a
Michelin 7.5 singlehandedly.

42:48.609 --> 42:51.656
Yeah, well, look, the fire's gone
out, and we still need to stay warm.

42:53.832 --> 42:57.183
Come on then, Marcus. I guess a
worker's hands are never clean.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.982
We need to maintain a stable
environment for McKenzie right now.

43:14.243 --> 43:19.031
She's just come through a deep and
traumatic hypnosis far too quickly.

43:19.858 --> 43:21.686
It's not healthy for her mind.

43:23.905 --> 43:28.257
The current situation isn't exactly
healthy for anyone's mind, Anita.

43:54.806 --> 43:57.417
I never leave the valley
without my craftsman.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.812
You never know when a hex
wrench may come in handy.

44:01.943 --> 44:06.687
If I'm brutally honest, Marcus, needle
nose pliers were my first love.

44:06.731 --> 44:11.649
Oh, well, I've always been partial to
a magnetic tipped screwdriver myself.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.669
Was that Kenz?

44:46.771 --> 44:48.903
Babe, are you all right?

44:50.513 --> 44:54.169
I feel like I'm potholing in a
back passage in Libanus.

44:54.779 --> 45:00.523
I love going below, I do. But I have
a twinge of sciatica in my back now.

45:00.785 --> 45:03.048
Barrel up.

45:09.924 --> 45:11.926
Jesus.

45:13.623 --> 45:18.193
You're bound to feel a little
skittish. Just try to relax.

45:18.846 --> 45:22.110
We found Hugo. He's outside.

45:30.162 --> 45:31.554
He's dead.

45:31.903 --> 45:32.991
What?

45:33.731 --> 45:35.384
He's by the woodpile.

45:35.994 --> 45:37.473
How did it happen?

45:37.517 --> 45:38.648
I don't know.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.607
What do we do?

45:47.179 --> 45:48.789
Bring him inside!

45:52.750 --> 45:55.056
Oh my God!

45:56.405 --> 45:58.146
Could he be unconscious?

45:58.190 --> 46:01.280
It's hypothermia.
We need to call a doctor.

46:27.915 --> 46:32.572
Okay. We have no form
of communication,

46:33.791 --> 46:36.750
and no way out of here
other than on foot.

46:39.884 --> 46:44.976
Two choices remain: we either
wait here until morning,

46:45.324 --> 46:49.937
or we all leave together now and
try and find the nearest village.

46:49.981 --> 46:51.939
The latter sounds like suicide.

46:51.983 --> 46:56.291
Yeah, well, someone is quite clearly out
there, and they know we're in here.

46:56.901 --> 46:58.380
We're sitting ducks.

46:58.554 --> 46:59.686
We're not leaving.

47:00.252 --> 47:01.949
We could get lost on the moors.

47:01.993 --> 47:07.215
I'm with Kenz. We sit tight.
We've got food and warmth here.

47:07.259 --> 47:08.216
Me too.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.304
Me three.

47:10.523 --> 47:11.872
All right.

47:14.527 --> 47:16.485
Then I think I should
take the rifle.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.925
You can go fuck
yourself, Marcus.

47:21.751 --> 47:25.886
I'm a licensed firearms handler, and
I'm bloody lethal. How about you?

47:26.931 --> 47:28.628
I just think we'd feel safer if

47:28.671 --> 47:31.239
Is this about my aim or my vag?

47:31.674 --> 47:36.244
Because I can assure you that
both are in tiptop working order.

47:49.736 --> 47:50.998
How are you holding up?

47:54.436 --> 47:56.743
I'm going to pack his things.

48:12.367 --> 48:13.542
How did he die?

48:14.195 --> 48:15.370
I don't know.

48:16.545 --> 48:17.982
There wasn't a mark on him.

48:19.809 --> 48:22.900
McKenzie hasn't been herself
since we arrived here.

48:23.813 --> 48:25.163
What do you mean by that?

49:10.730 --> 49:13.602
Oh, shit...

49:17.824 --> 49:18.999
Shit!

49:23.177 --> 49:24.874
McKenzie, they're insane.

49:25.223 --> 49:26.485
What?

49:26.528 --> 49:28.574
There's somebody downstairs.

49:30.141 --> 49:33.231
I don't know what kind of sick game is
being played, but they're lying to you.

49:33.361 --> 49:34.406
I don't?

49:36.190 --> 49:37.496
I don't understand.

49:37.539 --> 49:40.020
They fucking drugged me
and I woke up like this.

49:41.369 --> 49:43.067
You just get the gun off Jo.

49:43.328 --> 49:44.633
This was her idea.

49:44.677 --> 49:45.852
What? Why?

49:47.549 --> 49:48.986
I don't know. They're not who
we thought they were, McKenzie.

49:49.029 --> 49:52.380
They're part of some weird cult.

49:52.728 --> 49:55.340
I heard them whispering.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.170
We're not safe here.

50:00.084 --> 50:01.955
Okay, come with me.

50:03.435 --> 50:05.959
No. If I go downstairs,
they'll know you know.

50:06.829 --> 50:09.267
Just make sure Jo
doesn't have the gun.

50:10.659 --> 50:12.966
Okay. Okay.

50:14.141 --> 50:18.711
You have no idea what trauma
such as this can do to a person,

50:18.885 --> 50:22.497
and she's really been through the
wringer these past few months.

50:22.845 --> 50:27.937
Oh, your concern is almost convincing,
but it's a bit bloody late.

50:27.981 --> 50:31.245
How dare you? I am
genuinely concerned.

50:47.479 --> 50:48.741
All done?

50:50.308 --> 50:53.833
Your head is so
far up your arse,

50:53.876 --> 50:56.879
I'm surprised you haven't asked
Jo to borrow a head torch.

50:57.010 --> 51:01.058
What a novelty that would be,
to have something inside me.

51:01.362 --> 51:05.018
Oh, you can't blame me for that.
Jesus Christ!

51:05.192 --> 51:07.847
You despise me most of the time.

51:10.154 --> 51:12.243
I can imagine what you're going

51:15.202 --> 51:17.117
What are you doing, Kenz?

51:17.726 --> 51:21.513
Dining room. Now!

51:22.035 --> 51:24.081
That's a loaded gun
that you've got there.

51:25.430 --> 51:26.692
Go!

51:29.129 --> 51:33.090
Do you know what? I don't
know who you are anymore.

51:34.221 --> 51:36.180
What's your bloody problem?

51:36.223 --> 51:40.053
My problem? I think
it's your problem.

51:40.184 --> 51:42.838
Oh, she can do no
fucking wrong in your eyes.

51:54.154 --> 51:55.460
Oh my God.

51:56.330 --> 51:57.636
Back in there.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.692
What the hell's going on?

52:10.866 --> 52:12.346
Kenz, what are you doing?

52:12.477 --> 52:14.566
Just sit down, Jo.

52:15.393 --> 52:19.658
McKenzie, I need you to
take three deep breaths.

52:19.701 --> 52:21.616
Shut the fuck up, Anita.

52:24.315 --> 52:26.578
Grab those and tie everyone up.

52:26.752 --> 52:28.145
I'm sorry?

52:28.493 --> 52:31.322
Stay the fuck away from me.
I know what you've done.

52:31.365 --> 52:35.326
McKenzie, we haven't done anything.
You need to tell us what's going on.

52:38.633 --> 52:39.765
Tie them tight.

52:43.421 --> 52:46.424
McKenzie, no. You're
traumatized, bab.

52:46.598 --> 52:49.775
Yeah, no shit. Thanks to you!

52:50.645 --> 52:55.824
Anita, tell her what you said to me
earlier. Babe, it's the hypnosis.

52:55.868 --> 53:01.003
Oh, really? What fucked up
so-called friends you all are.

53:01.656 --> 53:02.962
You're not tying me up.

53:03.005 --> 53:04.224
Do it!

53:08.881 --> 53:10.274
Sit down.

53:12.798 --> 53:14.452
Hands behind your head.

53:15.975 --> 53:17.672
Don't fucking move.

53:30.555 --> 53:31.904
Hugo!

53:32.470 --> 53:33.993
I told you!

53:34.950 --> 53:36.213
Kenz!

53:36.865 --> 53:39.085
Yeah. I found him.

53:40.956 --> 53:46.571
Hugo, I've got the gun! Find this
cult on Craigslist, did you?

53:49.313 --> 53:50.923
Why would you do this to us?

53:52.316 --> 53:55.319
You're just so fucking
miserable in your own lives,

53:55.362 --> 53:57.059
you have to come and
fucking ruin ours.

53:57.103 --> 53:58.539
What have we done?

53:58.583 --> 54:02.630
I found him! He's upstairs!
He told me what you did!

54:03.718 --> 54:07.331
McKenzie, he's in the kitchen.

54:08.810 --> 54:10.986
Oh, really?

54:39.667 --> 54:40.886
Fuck.

55:00.427 --> 55:04.736
I spoke to him, upstairs.

55:05.780 --> 55:08.522
Who? Who's upstairs?

55:09.393 --> 55:11.438
Kenz, please untie us.

55:19.359 --> 55:20.621
Jesus!

55:20.795 --> 55:21.970
My God!

55:22.014 --> 55:25.017
Kenzie, get us off
these fucking chairs!

55:42.687 --> 55:45.080
What the hell did
you see up there?

55:45.211 --> 55:47.344
Hugo. Alive.

55:49.433 --> 55:51.913
Marcus, get the nine iron.

56:16.764 --> 56:21.247
He was there.
I swear, he was as real as you.

56:21.595 --> 56:23.597
The spirit world.

56:23.945 --> 56:25.817
What?

56:25.860 --> 56:30.212
I'm sorry, McKenzie. You saw large
stones where your sister vanished.

56:30.256 --> 56:31.779
Anita, please.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.781
Were menhirs, standing stones
used for ancient worship.

56:33.825 --> 56:36.305
I don't need this
information in my head.

56:37.655 --> 56:39.744
We weren't a religious
family though.

56:40.266 --> 56:46.359
Many believe they open a portal into
another dimension, for human sacrifice.

56:47.142 --> 56:51.973
I swear to God, Anita, I will
slap you if you don't shut up.

56:56.630 --> 57:01.113
Ignore it.

57:13.038 --> 57:17.129
All right, fucker show yourself.

57:23.352 --> 57:24.658
Guys?

57:26.486 --> 57:28.140
Sam, wait.

57:30.664 --> 57:32.100
There's a message.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.674
Feeling trapped by LBD?

57:41.762 --> 57:43.547
Lesbian Bed Death?

57:45.679 --> 57:47.289
Samantha!

57:47.333 --> 57:52.947
Babe! Help me get
her out of here!

57:54.688 --> 57:56.690
Pull harder!

58:00.215 --> 58:02.000
Harder!

58:05.873 --> 58:07.484
Anita!

58:10.095 --> 58:14.491
It's Kwaku Anansi.
It's Kwaku Anansi!

58:17.232 --> 58:22.760
Oh my God. Sammy? No! Oh.

58:40.081 --> 58:42.606
Anita, who is Anansi?

58:44.869 --> 58:50.831
My grandmother used to tell me folk
tales from Ghana about Kwaku Anansi,

58:51.571 --> 58:55.967
a spirit who could take the
form of man or arachnid.

58:56.620 --> 58:58.317
Sometimes both.

58:58.883 --> 59:04.105
It wasn't meant to scare. Anansi
was a storyteller and a trickster.

59:05.759 --> 59:08.501
But it terrified
me my whole life.

59:09.850 --> 59:11.635
And, that's what
you saw out there?

59:14.333 --> 59:15.813
And, I saw Hugo.

59:17.292 --> 59:20.731
Well, something is truly
fucking with us, isn't it?

59:21.253 --> 59:24.561
Whatever's doing this,
it's getting in our minds.

59:25.953 --> 59:28.695
It knows our fears and
it's using that against us.

59:29.696 --> 59:32.264
Well, Sammy wasn't frightened
of a bloody sofa bed.

59:32.307 --> 59:34.614
No, but she was claustrophobic.

59:35.093 --> 59:37.443
And, what was Hugo afraid of?

59:39.532 --> 59:40.664
Being alone.

59:54.721 --> 01:00:00.509
Right. Well, if you saw it, Anita,
I can bloody well aim for it.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.860
You can't open that
door. You just can't!

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:05.036
Anita, if we leave now,

01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:08.648
we can get the tyre changed and we
can get the fuck out of here, okay?

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:28.407
This is all my fault.

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:31.628
I'm so sorry.

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:34.935
You know how to book a holiday,
Kenz, I'll give you that.

01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:38.678
You were listening to your intuition.
We don't do it enough.

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:42.160
Closure. We all need it, bab.

01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:45.032
Your sister was communicating
with you from beyond.

01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:48.166
Frequency is released
through DNA.

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:51.560
It finds its way back to us
through the etheric plane.

01:00:58.132 --> 01:01:00.961
He's here! He's right there!

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.834
What are you doing? Anita?

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.366
Are you okay?

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:17.021
My wife just tried to kill me.

01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:20.677
She didn't mean it. Honest.

01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:56.756
I messed up.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.975
Jo, what happened?

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.803
It's empty.

01:02:01.326 --> 01:02:04.721
Okay, take it easy.
Breathe slowly, okay?

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:09.726
They make big balls here.
I just make cheese for a living.

01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:17.821
Where's your spur?

01:02:17.864 --> 01:02:22.347
It's in my fanny pack,
in the glove compartment.

01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.479
Can you stand?

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:30.398
Yeah. I think
I just gave myself a fright.

01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:37.623
Okay. You okay?

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:40.582
Yeah.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:46.937
Marcus, I'll find Anita.
You get Jo's car jacked up.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.634
I'm all right. I can do this.

01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:52.290
Did you hear that?

01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:53.465
No, let's go, Kenz.

01:02:53.813 --> 01:02:54.988
McKenzie?

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:58.035
Marcus, you find
Anita. I need to know.

01:02:58.165 --> 01:02:59.514
Know what?

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.169
She's here.

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:07.044
No, McKenzie we've
got to go now!

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:10.787
It's fine. This is why
I came, okay? Just go.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:12.832
Just go!

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:32.199
Anita?

01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:37.335
You are in a calm
and tranquil place.

01:03:38.118 --> 01:03:40.425
Nothing can harm you here.

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:03.317
Anita?

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:11.630
Anita? Open the door!
For God's sakes, open the door!

01:04:39.701 --> 01:04:43.096
Oh, for God's sakes,
Anita, open the door!

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:54.673
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:07.555
Oh no!

01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:54.385
Daisy?

01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.477
Oh my God!

01:06:50.528 --> 01:06:52.008
All right, buddy?

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.487
She's

01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:59.015
Anita? She? I'm so sorry.

01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:19.426
Kenz?

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:31.569
I can't believe you're here.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.746
Are you real?

01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:38.663
Of course, I am.
Of course, I am.

01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:42.406
What happened to you?
You just vanished.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:46.453
I don't know.
Long have I been down here?

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:51.763
The owners of this place, they took me.
They did things to me, bad things.

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:54.418
I just want to see mom and dad.

01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:56.463
Oh, Daisy.

01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:16.483
Kenz?

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.834
We need to go now.

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:22.924
Kenz?

01:08:37.024 --> 01:08:43.988
Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow

01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:37.825
Kids laughing

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:45.268
Fat Joey Fat Joey, can't get his shirt
on, fat Joey, can't get his shirt on.

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:51.187
They never stopped
looking for you.

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:54.973
But Mum just couldn't
take it anymore.

01:09:55.626 --> 01:09:57.715
Let's make a promise,

01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:01.240
to never split up ever again,
McKenzie, okay?

01:10:02.372 --> 01:10:03.895
Promise me?

01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:07.638
What?

01:10:09.509 --> 01:10:11.207
Don't leave me.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.947
What did you say?

01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:21.956
Don't leave me again.

01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:27.484
What is it?

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:34.230
Ah, you really sucked me in there.
I was only ever Rose to Daisy.

01:10:34.882 --> 01:10:37.842
Flowerpot kids. Remember?

01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:44.631
She would. So, who
the fuck are you?

01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:05.652
Jo?

01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:11.354
It's in here. Jo?

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:12.703
McKenzie?

01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:18.578
Open the door! Jo!
Open the fucking door!

01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:21.842
Jo, it's Marcus!
It's in him! Jo!

01:11:23.235 --> 01:11:24.280
McKenzie?

01:11:24.323 --> 01:11:27.457
Open the fucking
door! Open the door!

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.332
What the fuck was down there?

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:34.768
Go! Go!

01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:42.776
Are you shitting me?

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.778
What do you want?

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:49.305
Conceal your fear.

01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:53.744
No. Go here, go this way now.
No, down there.

01:11:57.008 --> 01:11:59.184
It's okay. Come on.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:05.059
Jo's outside. She's
waiting for us.

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:08.236
No. She came back
in here to look for you.

01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:11.675
Christ. We have to
get out of here.

01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:17.768
I can't. It wants me next.
But you have to leave.

01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:22.468
Marcus, shut up.
We're going together. No buts.

01:12:26.254 --> 01:12:27.560
Fuck.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.393
God.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:38.397
You have to make
a run for safety without me.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:41.139
We'll find Jo, and
then we can all go

01:12:41.182 --> 01:12:43.141
You're dead if you don't.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.100
What do you mean?

01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:49.974
I can't watch you die, McKenzie.

01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:53.151
Losing you

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.590
that's my ultimate fear.

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:06.599
Come on. Come on!

01:13:06.643 --> 01:13:06.991
Go.

01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:07.774
Come on!

01:13:07.818 --> 01:13:08.166
Go.

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.949
No, no!

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:09.994
McKenzie, run! Run!

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:15.042
Darling, I think I'm ready
to give us another try.

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:19.699
Jo?

01:13:42.374 --> 01:13:43.549
Shit!

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:17.583
Fuck me sideways!

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.237
You always said never
to look back, Dad.

01:15:05.239 --> 01:15:06.545
But I did.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.725
And now, I wish I didn't,
because there's nothing there.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:22.126
Daisy? If you can hear me now,
please help me.

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:30.961
I'm sorry they took you. I'm so sorry.
The guilt kills me every day.

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:42.015
And, it killed Mum too.
You were her first, remember?

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:46.759
I saw the grief in her eyes
every day until she died,

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:49.109
so please help me now.

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:52.025
Please.

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:57.727
McKenzie?

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:01.034
How do I know that's really you?

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.689
Trust me.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.083
How can I?

01:16:09.129 --> 01:16:12.872
The first time
we met was three years ago.

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:18.399
You came to my practice with
that little Pomeranian, Stevie.

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:22.708
And, the look of
panic on your face,

01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:25.668
because she'd swallowed
a chocolate, was

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:30.020
was amazing.

01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.589
It was a Minstrel, I think.

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.157
I fed her charcoal.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:41.945
You talked about how you'd
lost your inspiration to draw.

01:16:44.687 --> 01:16:47.951
And, that was the first time that
your dad was diagnosed with cancer.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:54.479
Marcus, you're the
nicest man I've ever met.

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.048
You're like a father to me.

01:16:59.484 --> 01:17:05.621
But this thing, whatever it is,
it's not going to let us both live.

01:17:06.839 --> 01:17:08.014
You know that.

01:17:08.841 --> 01:17:10.451
That's why we have
to leave this place.

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:12.932
It's not going to let us leave.

01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:18.198
And, the feelings you have for me
are putting us both in danger.

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:21.027
You said it yourself.

01:17:21.419 --> 01:17:25.771
McKenzie, I can't
stop how I feel.

01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:31.516
Then we're both dead,
because it's either you or me.

01:17:35.563 --> 01:17:38.305
Don't you dare stop
fighting, okay?

01:17:39.089 --> 01:17:41.657
And, don't ever change.

01:17:44.094 --> 01:17:47.140
Because you are amazing.

01:17:57.281 --> 01:17:58.456
I won't.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.899
Okay, Daisy, I'm here.

01:18:55.382 --> 01:18:57.384
No, you come here.

01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:08.004
Let me show you.

01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:11.834
I can't, because you're dead.

01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:17.448
Why are you doing this to me?

01:19:22.496 --> 01:19:24.672
Let me show you.

01:19:32.593 --> 01:19:38.643
No! Stop! Wait!
Wait, stop! Stop! Wait!

01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:45.084
Where the hell did
you come from?

01:19:45.128 --> 01:19:47.913
Just drive. Please hurry!

01:20:06.062 --> 01:20:10.066
We need to call the police.
Just go to any village.

01:20:13.112 --> 01:20:14.810
They're gone.

01:20:17.682 --> 01:20:19.815
They're all gone!

01:20:26.647 --> 01:20:28.127
Are you listening?

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:32.262
All my friends are dead!

01:20:43.447 --> 01:20:45.971
Where are you going?
You're going back to the house!

01:20:46.015 --> 01:20:52.369
You can't! No! I
need to get out! Oh!

01:21:58.565 --> 01:22:03.483
Oh, Nice taste, love. Yeah.

01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:28.334
Come on, my beauty.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:39.449
Oh, fuck.

01:24:14.005 --> 01:24:19.576
Six. The number of perfection.

01:24:23.145 --> 01:24:28.933
My gratitude, as ever,
o Dark Lord of the Underworld.

01:24:37.246 --> 01:24:43.426
And, that, my friends, is the
true meaning of Boxing Day Blues.
