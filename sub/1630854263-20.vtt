WEBVTT

00:05.500 --> 00:08.550
So, Calvin, what
are we drinking to?

00:08.750 --> 00:09.790
To success.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.390
Marty and I are having
our grand opening

00:11.590 --> 00:12.460
in a couple of weeks.

00:12.660 --> 00:13.560
It's all coming together.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.560
Ah, well, to Butler and Butler.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.300
Oh, uh, we actually
have to change the name.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.270
There is a Butler and Butler
Funeral Home.

00:22.470 --> 00:23.770
Now, I made them an offer,

00:23.970 --> 00:26.140
but they said
over their dead bodies.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.360
(snickers)
(laughs)

00:29.130 --> 00:31.210
A pun, huh?

00:31.410 --> 00:32.980
You really are
in a good mood.

00:33.180 --> 00:35.410
In that case, these guys sound
like a real bunch of stiffs.

00:35.610 --> 00:36.620
Am I right?

00:36.820 --> 00:38.630
No.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.140
Oh, Mama.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.590
I have only had
three dates with Janelle,

00:43.790 --> 00:46.160
and she says you invited her
here for dinner tomorrow.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.540
Uh-huh.

00:48.410 --> 00:49.930
And you didn't ask me?

00:50.130 --> 00:51.830
Well, I didn't know
if you were free.

00:52.030 --> 00:53.980
I mean, you're more
than welcome to come.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.440
Well, th-this is
a little awkward, Ma.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.510
It's a new relationship,
and she is my English professor.

01:00.710 --> 01:03.680
Well, you're the one who said
that she may be the one.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.400
Don't you want
your mother's opinion?
No.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.810
Pop, did you know
about this?

01:09.010 --> 01:10.350
Of course.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.100
I keep up with my woman.

01:14.270 --> 01:15.350
Ah.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.960
There's my partner.
Come on in.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.990
I was just telling Dave
how great everything's going.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.760
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.230
There are protesters in
the street in Boyle Heights.

01:23.430 --> 01:24.600
They're marching
against gentrification

01:24.800 --> 01:26.300
in the neighborhood.
Good.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.590
I hope they march those suckers
right on out of there.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.570
No offense, Dave.

01:31.770 --> 01:33.610
Uh, none taken,
but, Calvin,

01:33.810 --> 01:35.440
you should really
read this flyer.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.280
Th-They're talking
about your business.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.750
They say that you're
the gentrifiers.

01:39.950 --> 01:40.910
What?

01:41.110 --> 01:42.620
I can't be a gentrifier.

01:42.820 --> 01:45.530
I'm not even white.
No offense, Dave.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.950
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

01:49.150 --> 01:50.510
* Welcome to the hood. *

01:58.350 --> 02:01.770
Dave, isn't Grover's family tree
project looking great?

02:01.970 --> 02:03.200
Oh, amazing.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.240
Hey, wasn't Great-Grandma
Johnson a handsome woman?

02:06.440 --> 02:09.410
My teacher says
I need her personal details.

02:09.610 --> 02:10.410
What was her job?

02:10.610 --> 02:12.850
Oh, well, it was World War I,

02:13.050 --> 02:15.630
and she ran a house, and...

02:16.970 --> 02:18.450
There were other women there.

02:18.650 --> 02:20.150
And, um...

02:20.350 --> 02:23.690
Okay, you see, when, um,
when soldiers, uh...

02:23.890 --> 02:25.120
who were lonely and had money

02:25.320 --> 02:26.560
would come home
from the war...

02:26.760 --> 02:28.540
Just say nurse, Dave.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.380
She was a nurse.

02:32.180 --> 02:35.430
Um, the only missing piece
is your dad.

02:35.630 --> 02:37.400
Oh. Well, you know,
my dad left

02:37.600 --> 02:39.570
when I was younger
than you are now, Grover.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.370
Hmm.

02:41.570 --> 02:44.480
What if I just put a picture
of some other old guy?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.010
Here. This guy'll do.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.460
Grover, that's Colonel Sanders.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.920
Cool. Grandpa was in the Army.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.470
(laughs)

02:54.070 --> 02:57.190
Pop, why don't you tell Janelle
about you and Marty's new shop?

02:57.390 --> 02:58.860
They're gonna be fixing
electric cars.

02:59.060 --> 03:00.530
Yes, that's right.

03:00.730 --> 03:01.730
It's called the Fuse Box.

03:01.930 --> 03:03.660
Ooh, I like that name,
but, wait,

03:03.860 --> 03:05.930
do electric cars
even have fuses?

03:06.130 --> 03:07.130
(cackles)

03:07.330 --> 03:09.970
Do-do electric cars have fuses?

03:10.170 --> 03:11.650
(laughter)

03:13.360 --> 03:14.560
Do they?

03:16.890 --> 03:18.210
They don't, but, you know,

03:18.410 --> 03:20.080
it's-it's just a fun,
retro name.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.700
Yes, retro.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.720
Listen,
you know what?

03:23.920 --> 03:26.220
A funny thing happened. Um...

03:26.420 --> 03:29.460
The people saw us building
a nice new shop,

03:29.660 --> 03:34.160
and <i>they</i> thought
that <i>we</i> were there

03:34.360 --> 03:35.860
to gentrify their neighborhood.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.800
MARTY:
Yeah, I-I don't know

03:38.000 --> 03:39.370
if it's that funny, Dad.

03:39.570 --> 03:42.000
You know, I was on Twitter
and people are worked up.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.170
They are?

03:43.370 --> 03:44.970
Yeah. There's even
a hashtag.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.640
#RefuseTheFuse.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.140
(groans)
CALVIN:
Then I'll-- you know,

03:48.340 --> 03:49.910
I'll just come up
with my own hashtag

03:50.110 --> 03:51.580
and drown them out.

03:51.780 --> 03:53.550
#Calvin'sDope.

03:53.750 --> 03:57.200
#ButlerLove. You know?

03:58.570 --> 04:00.450
Oh, hey, buddy.
Is that the finished product?

04:00.650 --> 04:02.620
Let me see it.
Yeah, I got everybody.

04:02.820 --> 04:05.490
And it turns out
Great-Grandma Johnson wasn't

04:05.690 --> 04:06.730
a nurse after all.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.090
I asked Grammy,

04:08.290 --> 04:11.080
and she said
she was a lady of the night.

04:12.450 --> 04:15.200
Okay, uh, well,
do you know what that means?

04:15.400 --> 04:18.050
Well, obviously
she solved crimes after dark.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.010
Uh, well, you know, Grover,
that's not exactly what it was.

04:22.210 --> 04:24.230
No, don't argue
with Grammy.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.880
Is that a picture
of my dad?

04:31.080 --> 04:32.120
Whoa, that's recent.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.490
Where did you get that?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.720
Facebook.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.410
It's this old website.

04:38.010 --> 04:40.030
He lives in Oxnard.

04:40.230 --> 04:41.930
He loves Huey Lewis
and the News,

04:42.130 --> 04:43.130
just like you do, Dave.

04:43.330 --> 04:45.160
Yeah. I mean,
that's not saying much.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.420
Everybody loves
Huey Lewis and the News.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.440
I'll meet you
in the car, sweetie.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.840
Dave, did you know
your dad was so close by?

04:55.040 --> 04:56.710
I had no idea.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.040
I mean, he sent me
a friend request on Facebook,

04:59.240 --> 05:00.410
but that was years ago.

05:00.610 --> 05:02.780
Oh, my God.
You never told me that.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.320
I didn't accept it.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.120
I mean,
just 'cause he lives in Oxnard

05:06.320 --> 05:07.450
and is apparently
a fellow member of

05:07.650 --> 05:09.090
the Hugh Crew doesn't
change the fact

05:09.290 --> 05:10.860
that he abandoned me
when I was 11.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.490
(sighs)

05:12.690 --> 05:15.760
Now I have "Hip to Be Square"
stuck in my head.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.150
And for the first time,
I am not loving it.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.200
Oh, hey.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.840
Oh, hello, fellas.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.340
What is that you say?

05:26.540 --> 05:28.770
"What grade did you get
on your English paper, Malcolm?"

05:28.970 --> 05:30.640
An "A."

05:30.840 --> 05:33.280
(laughs)
Ooh. Wow.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.810
You got an "A"
from your girlfriend.

05:35.010 --> 05:35.810
That's surprising.

05:36.010 --> 05:37.580
(chuckles sarcastically)

05:37.780 --> 05:40.690
Oh, please, man. I got
an "A" because I earned it.

05:40.890 --> 05:43.060
And your boy might just
make the dean's list.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.790
Oh, is Janelle the dean, too?

05:45.990 --> 05:47.960
(laughter)

05:48.160 --> 05:49.290
(laughs forcefully) No.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.200
Hey, look,
there's no shame in it.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.070
You're still excelling
because of your skills.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.930
Just maybe
not your academic skills.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.030
(mutters)
(laughter)

05:56.230 --> 05:57.470
Hey, look, Malcolm.

05:57.670 --> 05:59.640
I did the same thing
to get a job at Arby's.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.470
What? That...

06:01.670 --> 06:03.680
You know what? I have always
gotten good grades.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.380
I'm not gonna let you two
get in my head.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.310
And wasn't the manager
of that Arby's your cousin?

06:08.510 --> 06:09.900
I mean, by marriage.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.240
A lot of people showed up
for this.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.120
You were right,
we should have bought

06:16.320 --> 06:17.220
a third tray of tacos.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.820
No way.

06:19.020 --> 06:21.790
You know who buys
three trays of tacos?

06:21.990 --> 06:23.010
Jeff Bezos.

06:24.310 --> 06:26.700
We don't want them thinking
we're one of those out-of-touch

06:26.900 --> 06:29.920
rich corporations
with unlimited taco money.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.410
Ah.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.810
These are fantastic.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.210
Oh, well, all right.

06:37.410 --> 06:38.910
I'm glad you enjoy them.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.280
You ever been to El Rey's?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.650
Best Mexican food
in South Pasadena.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.150
Oh, I'll have to check it out
sometime.

06:45.350 --> 06:46.390
Luis Cabrera. Uh...

06:46.590 --> 06:48.390
Very nice setup you got here.

06:48.590 --> 06:51.190
Well, I mean, it's not
too nice, you know, but, uh,

06:51.390 --> 06:52.360
Calvin Butler.
Oh.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.010
Man of the people.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.160
Well, I can't wait to hear
what you guys got planned.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.730
Awesome. Okay.

06:58.930 --> 07:02.590
Um, so can, um,
everybody please have a seat?

07:04.150 --> 07:05.390
Sit down!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.860
Thank you.

07:11.730 --> 07:12.850
Okay, baby. Go ahead.

07:13.050 --> 07:16.380
Yeah, all right, uh,
hello, everybody.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.680
I am Calvin Butler,

07:18.880 --> 07:21.620
co-owner of
Fuse Box EV Solutions.

07:21.820 --> 07:25.060
This is my partner,
my son Marty Butler.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.430
And as you can see,

07:26.630 --> 07:29.160
we are no gentrifiers.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.030
Okay? So I hope

07:31.230 --> 07:32.360
that clears everything up.

07:32.570 --> 07:33.850
Please enjoy the tacos.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.740
Uh, Luis, my new friend.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.670
Do you, uh,
do you have a question?

07:39.870 --> 07:42.270
Uh, yes. Yes, uh,
thanks, Calvin.

07:42.470 --> 07:44.680
Uh, my-my question is
very simple, um...

07:44.880 --> 07:46.560
Who the hell
do you think you are?

07:47.360 --> 07:48.580
Excuse me?

07:48.780 --> 07:50.450
What? You think that just
because you're not

07:50.650 --> 07:51.780
some white guy,
we're gonna be cool

07:51.980 --> 07:53.320
with you busting
into our neighborhood

07:53.520 --> 07:54.620
and pushing out our businesses?

07:54.820 --> 07:58.360
Look, I-I'm not busting
or pushing anything.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.740
We're building and improving.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.530
Oh, is that what this is?
Improvement?

08:03.730 --> 08:05.100
You know, I-I think
I liked it better

08:05.300 --> 08:06.470
when we could all get together

08:06.670 --> 08:08.300
as a neighborhood
and enjoy our coffee shops

08:08.500 --> 08:10.470
and our-our tailor
and our bookstore.
(murmuring in agreement)

08:10.670 --> 08:12.510
But, no, it's all gone now.

08:12.710 --> 08:15.760
But yet here you are
with your fancy ED Solutions.

08:17.830 --> 08:22.110
Uh, it-it-it's EV Solutions.

08:22.310 --> 08:24.530
Uh, it's very different.

08:26.270 --> 08:27.650
I miss the coffee shop.

08:27.850 --> 08:29.050
They have the best conchas.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.490
(overlapping agreements)
CALVIN: Okay, look, look.

08:30.690 --> 08:32.360
I don't know nothing
about no couches.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.860
All right?

08:34.060 --> 08:37.230
That coffee shop was not here
when we leased the place.

08:37.430 --> 08:39.200
It was already closed.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.500
You're right.
You're right, it was.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.500
They raised the rent
because outsiders like you

08:43.700 --> 08:45.470
with fat wallets came in,
am I right?

08:45.670 --> 08:46.840
GROUP:
Yeah.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.240
Guys, guys, look.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.810
We want to be a friend
to the neighborhood, all right?

08:51.010 --> 08:52.760
I brought tacos.

08:53.530 --> 08:56.330
Only two trays.

08:58.730 --> 09:00.420
Yeah, and the worst part,

09:00.620 --> 09:01.920
they're from Pasadena.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.960
(groaning, murmuring)

09:04.160 --> 09:08.210
You can't bring Pasadena tacos
to Boyle Heights.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.300
(chanting):
One, two, three, four!

09:10.500 --> 09:12.030
We don't want your EV store!

09:12.230 --> 09:13.700
One, two, three, four!

09:13.900 --> 09:15.470
We don't want your EV store!

09:15.670 --> 09:16.940
(chanting continues)
Oh, no, no, no.
Well, you know what?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.600
Y'all got chants?
Well, I got chants.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.810
(chanting):
Hell no.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.110
No tacos.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.610
Hell no. No tacos.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.580
I'm the boss,
so grab that salsa.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.030
(chanting):
One, two, three, four...

09:31.100 --> 09:32.350
I mean, where do
those people get off

09:32.550 --> 09:34.120
saying my shop's gonna
ruin their neighborhood?

09:34.320 --> 09:37.060
And they've got some nerve
yelling at my man,

09:37.260 --> 09:39.160
and those corny-ass chants.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.580
Mine was better than theirs,
and it was off the dome.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.930
Dave?
What's going on, man?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.140
You hitting that yo-yo
pretty hard.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.440
You know most men learn
to yo-yo from their dads?

09:54.640 --> 09:56.580
Uh, no.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.440
I didn't get that.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.910
I had to teach myself.

10:00.110 --> 10:01.580
How to yo-yo?

10:01.780 --> 10:03.420
Yeah, see? You get it.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.150
You were there
for Malcolm and Marty

10:05.350 --> 10:06.820
during their yo-yo years.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.550
They didn't have to go
to the library and get a book.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.090
Okay.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.060
Hey, I'm starting to think
this is not about a yo-yo.

10:13.260 --> 10:14.960
Oh, yeah, great,
here comes the lecture.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.490
"This isn't about a yo-yo, Dave.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.330
This is about your dad
coming back into your life."

10:18.530 --> 10:19.510
Okay. What?

10:20.820 --> 10:22.500
Look, come on, man, sit down.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.220
What's-what's going on?

10:28.060 --> 10:30.340
Grover found my dad.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.480
Apparently,
he lives in Oxnard, and...

10:32.680 --> 10:34.650
I haven't seen him
since I was 11.

10:34.850 --> 10:35.850
Hmm.

10:36.050 --> 10:37.120
So, are you gonna see him?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.650
Why should I?

10:38.850 --> 10:40.320
He up and left when I was
a kid. I mean, you're a dad.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.850
Would you ever do
that to your kids?

10:42.050 --> 10:43.660
(scoffs) No, sir.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.520
Well, guess who did.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.610
My father Lamar Johnson.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.900
Grover? Lamar?

10:54.100 --> 10:57.050
You Johnsons are killing me
with these Black-ass names.

10:59.020 --> 11:03.310
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
any man that leaves you as a kid

11:03.510 --> 11:05.680
doesn't deserve anything
from you.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.180
Yeah, thank you.

11:07.380 --> 11:10.430
But maybe you deserve
something from him.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.090
Dave, I miss my dad every day,

11:14.290 --> 11:16.590
and I would give anything
for the opportunity

11:16.790 --> 11:19.310
just to speak with him
for a few more minutes.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.860
I mean, think about it,
maybe...

11:22.060 --> 11:23.360
you need some clarity.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.300
Maybe you want
to hear his story.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.700
No, no, I don't want
to hear his story.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.680
I need him to hear my story.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.960
I'm just so angry, Calvin.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.680
Dave, if that's the way
you feel, then tell him.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.180
But just make sure
you don't miss the chance

11:42.380 --> 11:44.230
while you still have it.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.370
Maybe you're right.

11:48.870 --> 11:52.110
(sighs) Thanks, Calvin.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.860
Wow.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.780
Never seen someone yo-yo sad.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.620
(knocking)

12:07.490 --> 12:08.540
Gemma, you got a min...

12:08.740 --> 12:09.410
(shushes)

12:09.610 --> 12:10.340
One of the smoke detectors

12:10.540 --> 12:11.540
has a low battery beep.

12:11.740 --> 12:12.540
I'm trying to figure out
which one.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.710
Got it.

12:14.910 --> 12:15.980
I just had a quick question...

12:16.180 --> 12:16.880
(smoke detector beeps)
No, no, no, no!

12:17.080 --> 12:18.730
Ooh, you talked over it.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.520
Now we have about 30 seconds.
What's up?

12:21.720 --> 12:23.660
Okay, uh, before
you were a principal,

12:23.860 --> 12:25.060
you were a teacher, right?

12:25.260 --> 12:26.790
Would your personal feelings
towards a student

12:26.990 --> 12:28.230
ever affect how you graded them?

12:28.430 --> 12:29.660
All the time.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.060
Really?

12:31.260 --> 12:32.600
I'm not gonna give a good grade

12:32.800 --> 12:35.070
to the kid who said
I had manly hands.

12:35.270 --> 12:37.000
Oh. (clicks tongue)

12:37.200 --> 12:38.340
Okay, Gemma, but, uh...

12:38.540 --> 12:39.940
Damn, I never noticed your hands
before.

12:40.140 --> 12:40.940
They are...

12:41.140 --> 12:42.240
lovely.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.830
I still don't notice 'em.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.040
(smoke detector beeps)

12:46.240 --> 12:47.050
Was that in the kitchen?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.350
I thought it was upstairs.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.980
Damn it.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.420
So,

12:51.620 --> 12:53.490
this is about
you being in Janelle's class?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.250
Yes, I am doing really well
in the class,

12:56.450 --> 12:57.790
but now I'm worried
it's because...

12:57.990 --> 13:00.860
I'm doing really well
outside the class.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.180
(chuckling)

13:04.210 --> 13:06.610
(laughing):
Okay.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.870
Because you're so good
at pleasing her?

13:11.070 --> 13:13.560
(laughing):
Oh, men.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.810
It is not that funny.

13:17.010 --> 13:17.980
(sighs)

13:18.180 --> 13:19.810
(chuckles)

13:20.010 --> 13:21.350
You know what I should do?

13:21.550 --> 13:24.250
I should do a terrible job
on the paper on purpose,

13:24.450 --> 13:27.440
see if she gives me an
"A" anyway, there it is.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.060
Can you believe
that Luis guy?

13:32.260 --> 13:34.630
Bad-mouthing Pasadena tacos?

13:34.830 --> 13:36.530
Ain't nothing wrong
with these tacos.

13:36.730 --> 13:39.130
Well, you know,
I-I was thinking, though,

13:39.330 --> 13:41.370
what they're concerned about,

13:41.570 --> 13:42.900
they're not crazy.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.100
Are you taking their side
and eating all the carnitas?

13:46.300 --> 13:47.570
(muttering)
No, D-Daddy, no, that...

13:47.770 --> 13:48.770
Uh...

13:48.970 --> 13:50.680
You know what, baby?
Maybe he's right.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.410
You know,
those people are afraid

13:52.610 --> 13:54.930
their neighborhood is
losing its identity.

13:56.130 --> 13:58.420
And you of all people
should understand that.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.520
I mean, you remember
how upset you were

14:00.720 --> 14:02.420
when Friendly's Market
was replaced

14:02.620 --> 14:03.920
by Mucho Mochi?
Mm-hmm.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.420
I wasn't upset.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.680
You damn near lost your mind.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.000
And now it's your favorite.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.860
It's not my favorite.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.300
(scoffs) I mean,

14:13.500 --> 14:16.720
I like the green tea,
but it's not my favorite.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.470
Dad, to be fair,

14:19.670 --> 14:20.910
most of the people
in that neighborhood

14:21.110 --> 14:22.270
can't afford electric cars.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.240
They don't see
how our business helps them.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.540
Okay, but you saw
what commercial property

14:26.740 --> 14:28.410
is going for these days.
All right?

14:28.610 --> 14:30.720
That was the only space
we could afford.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.220
Now, if those people
don't like it,

14:32.420 --> 14:33.890
then I don't know
what to tell 'em.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.700
Maybe don't tell them anything.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.520
Just go down there,
be your charming self,

14:39.720 --> 14:41.190
and show them
that you understand.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.930
MARTY:
Yeah, Dad.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.200
You get them together

14:44.400 --> 14:45.730
and you prove to them
that you're an ally.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.200
That...
Marty, Marty, Marty,
Marty. You know what?

14:47.400 --> 14:49.370
I know what I'm-a do.

14:49.570 --> 14:51.740
I'm just gonna go down there,
be my charming self,

14:51.940 --> 14:54.290
and prove to them
that I'm an ally.

14:57.460 --> 14:59.180
(knocking)

14:59.380 --> 15:00.730
Hold on.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.950
Hello.
Hey, handsome.

15:05.150 --> 15:06.220
BOTH:
Mmm.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.020
Hey, can I ask you a question?

15:08.220 --> 15:09.820
Of course.

15:10.020 --> 15:10.990
What the hell is this?

15:11.190 --> 15:12.660
That is my essay.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.160
Oh, well, let me read you
my favorite passage.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.860
Okay.
"This story was short,

15:18.060 --> 15:20.000
"making it a short story

15:20.200 --> 15:22.170
"as opposed to
a long story,

15:22.370 --> 15:24.290
which is a novel."
(mouths)

15:26.350 --> 15:27.810
That is technically true.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.110
Well, yes, it is.

15:29.310 --> 15:31.140
And so, technically,
you got a "D."

15:31.340 --> 15:32.840
(laughs)

15:33.050 --> 15:35.250
That is fantastic.

15:35.450 --> 15:37.080
Why is that fantastic?

15:37.280 --> 15:40.450
Well,
because you passed my test.

15:40.650 --> 15:42.050
You see,
I was all worried

15:42.250 --> 15:44.190
that I was only getting A's
because...

15:44.390 --> 15:45.520
you and I are a thing.

15:45.720 --> 15:46.930
So, you wrote this
garbage on purpose?

15:47.130 --> 15:49.160
Yes, I did. (laughs)

15:49.360 --> 15:50.160
Pretty brilliant, right?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.010
Let me get this straight.

15:53.650 --> 15:54.870
You thought
I would give you an "A"

15:55.070 --> 15:56.100
that you didn't earn?

15:56.300 --> 15:59.170
But now I know
that you wouldn't,

15:59.370 --> 16:00.370
so... (laughs)

16:00.570 --> 16:01.770
You want some of
this cheese plate?

16:01.970 --> 16:03.310
It's...
Mm-mm.

16:03.510 --> 16:04.780
So, in that mind of yours,

16:04.980 --> 16:07.310
you thought
you were breaking me off so good

16:07.510 --> 16:09.180
that I would just
throw away my principles?

16:09.380 --> 16:11.950
Well, now that you have
said it out loud

16:12.150 --> 16:14.820
like that, I-I kind of
feel like an ass.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.120
Hmm.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.960
And an egomaniac.
Mm.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.160
And a-- and an idiot?

16:19.360 --> 16:20.790
Keep going.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.580
More? That's...

16:23.580 --> 16:25.030
I didn't give you
the credit you deserve,

16:25.230 --> 16:26.980
and I'm sorry.

16:27.850 --> 16:31.070
And right after dinner,
I'm gonna rewrite that essay.

16:31.270 --> 16:34.340
Well, you can rewrite it.
I'm not gonna regrade it.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.840
You got a "D."

16:37.040 --> 16:38.780
Damn, you are beautiful,

16:38.980 --> 16:41.800
you're smart,
and you have integrity.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.320
I like that.
Mm.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.340
You're still getting a "D."
Damn.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.970
Well, Dr. Finch,
that makes two of us.

16:56.310 --> 16:57.800
All right.
Hey, everybody.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.520
Thank you so much for
coming back. Hey...

17:01.450 --> 17:02.300
Really, Luis?

17:02.500 --> 17:04.100
That's what we doing?

17:04.300 --> 17:06.170
Well, you didn't seem
to get the hint last time,

17:06.370 --> 17:09.120
so I thought you could use
a little, um, visual aid.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.960
Could-could, uh...
could-could I get one of those?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.550
Now, what did I do?

17:18.750 --> 17:20.720
(chanting):
One, two, three, four!

17:20.920 --> 17:22.020
We don't want your EV store!

17:22.220 --> 17:23.620
Five, six, seven, eight!

17:23.820 --> 17:25.520
Fuse Box is the place we hate!

17:25.720 --> 17:27.760
(chanting continues)
Oh, oh, so y'all adding verses?

17:27.960 --> 17:29.730
You know what?
People, come on.

17:29.930 --> 17:31.730
Can we just take
this down a notch?

17:31.930 --> 17:34.430
(chanting stops)
(sighs)

17:34.630 --> 17:38.500
Listen, I owe you
all an apology.

17:38.700 --> 17:42.310
The character of my neighborhood
matters to me.

17:42.510 --> 17:44.580
Now, I realize that

17:44.780 --> 17:47.630
the character of your
neighborhood matters to you.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.020
And the other night,
after some contemplation

17:52.220 --> 17:55.840
all on my own, without
any help from anyone...

17:56.740 --> 18:01.040
...I realized that
I need to be your ally.

18:02.510 --> 18:03.730
Look, I have a plan, all right?

18:03.930 --> 18:06.530
Is there someone here
named Julian?

18:06.730 --> 18:08.920
I'm Julian.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.600
Julian, look,
I understand that

18:12.800 --> 18:15.010
you used to have a coffee shop
on this block.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.570
Well, I've been thinking

18:16.770 --> 18:19.310
I could use a coffee stand
right in that corner.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.510
You know, people
could have a latte

18:21.710 --> 18:23.780
while they wait for
their cars to be repaired,

18:23.980 --> 18:26.370
and I'm gonna need
somebody to run it.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.040
This dude is literally giving
my job to somebody else.

18:34.510 --> 18:37.230
Uh, no, I was talking about you.

18:37.430 --> 18:39.950
Oh, cool.
I-I could do that.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.750
Julian is not the sharpest
cheese on the cracker, is he?

18:46.990 --> 18:49.470
Okay. And-and I'm not done here,
people.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.280
I want to hire local.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.640
I understand that

18:52.840 --> 18:55.850
Antonia's Tacos was
a local institution

18:56.050 --> 18:57.800
before you lost your lease.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.750
Well, I got
a permanent spot for you

19:00.950 --> 19:02.620
in the parking lot
out front

19:02.820 --> 19:04.360
for your taco truck.
(shrieks)

19:04.560 --> 19:06.520
(laughing):
Thank you.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.690
Thank you.

19:07.890 --> 19:10.800
Ay! You are an angel,
Mr. Calvin.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.160
(laughs)

19:12.360 --> 19:15.370
And to-to all of you.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.830
If you used to work around here,

19:17.030 --> 19:18.640
please let me know
what your skills are.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.170
Maybe we can find
a place for you at the shop.

19:20.370 --> 19:23.680
So, now he thinks
he can just buy us.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.960
Oh, God. This guy.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.080
Well, I can be bought.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.100
Me, too.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.620
Listen, Luis.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.490
We're trying to
meet you halfway, man.

19:34.690 --> 19:35.990
Are you with us?

19:36.190 --> 19:38.320
(sighs) Fine. Fine.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.290
We'll call off the protest,
but we'll be watching you.

19:41.490 --> 19:43.230
You know what?
We'll be watching you.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.600
Well, you know where I'll be,
so I'll be watching you.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.470
(stammers) You watch me
and I'll watch you.

19:47.670 --> 19:48.930
We'll just be watching.

19:49.130 --> 19:50.400
Okay.
Yeah, we'll just see

19:50.600 --> 19:51.840
who watches the most.
Uh-huh.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.940
Gonna be watching me, like I...
Yeah.

19:54.140 --> 19:56.410
(muttering)
Still watching you.

19:56.610 --> 19:57.940
You keep watching. (scoffs)

19:58.140 --> 20:00.410
Like, like, he the only one
who can watch people.

20:00.610 --> 20:02.560
(both muttering)
Still watching!

20:09.300 --> 20:11.020
(smoke detector beeps)

20:11.220 --> 20:13.040
Where did that beep come from?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.090
I don't know.

20:15.290 --> 20:17.330
Is that your dad's
friend request?

20:17.530 --> 20:18.700
Yeah.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.160
Looks like
he posted some pictures

20:20.370 --> 20:21.600
from the Huey Lewis concert.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.370
Yeah, it's from the Plan B tour.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.370
That album was--
and I don't say this lightly--

20:26.570 --> 20:27.970
just okay.

20:28.170 --> 20:31.310
(chuckles) Okay. Look.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.580
Whatever you decide,
I support you.

20:33.780 --> 20:34.880
You know that.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.610
But he did reach out.

20:36.810 --> 20:38.700
(sighs)
That's something.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.070
(sighs)

20:48.680 --> 20:52.030
Friend request accepted.

20:52.230 --> 20:53.100
(smoke detector beeps)

20:53.300 --> 20:55.180
(objects clattering)

20:56.780 --> 20:58.020
I got it!
