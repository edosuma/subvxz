01:22.234 --> 01:25.880
- What?
- I was just thinking of a time.

01:26.530 --> 01:28.390
- You want to hear it?
- Play something else.

01:28.490 --> 01:30.735
No, no, no. It's a good one.

01:31.118 --> 01:34.396
You just turned 15, you were a senior,

01:34.496 --> 01:36.623
you took me out
in Mom's old station wagon.

01:36.723 --> 01:40.652
Remember? The Dragon Wagon.
You were gonna teach me how to drive.

01:40.752 --> 01:44.206
And there was that one tree
and nothing else...

01:49.845 --> 01:52.807
...someone banged into the car
while we were inside...

01:52.907 --> 01:55.775
That's right. You actually lied for me.

01:55.875 --> 01:59.896
- I lied for me.
- No, come on. You lied for both of us.

02:00.019 --> 02:04.126
You actually did something decent for me.
That's a part of history you can't change.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.328
That was a stop sign.

02:09.428 --> 02:10.729
You're kidding, right?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.765
In your car, I'd be kidding?

02:12.865 --> 02:16.278
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.

02:25.978 --> 02:27.286
Come on, Darry.

02:39.259 --> 02:43.095
"Gay Fever!" No, "Gay Forever."

02:43.195 --> 02:47.466
"Gay Forever." That's mine.
That's three for little bro'.

02:47.566 --> 02:50.569
That's a 6, not a G, you idiot.

02:50.669 --> 02:52.910
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.983
- That's five to two.
- Shit.

02:55.674 --> 02:57.051
"Gay Fever?"

03:10.823 --> 03:12.393
Sexy forever, huh?

03:13.392 --> 03:15.736
You know that is you in 40 years.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.435
There's usually a reason
when you like the long way home.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.448
Gee, like, maybe I like the country?

03:26.338 --> 03:27.408
Okay.

03:27.773 --> 03:28.741
Just drive, brat.

03:28.841 --> 03:32.244
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.

03:32.344 --> 03:37.293
"Trisha, why are you driving home
for spring break with your brat brother...

03:37.683 --> 03:41.887
"and not heading off somewhere with
that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"

03:41.987 --> 03:44.256
I will tell them
the same thing I'll tell you:

03:44.356 --> 03:46.358
None of your goddamn business.

03:47.326 --> 03:48.464
What?

03:48.594 --> 03:52.398
You don't think I could understand
the complex nature of your relationships?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.967
No, I look at you as a real expert.

03:55.067 --> 03:57.377
Whatever. I don't care.

03:58.637 --> 04:00.873
I'm just saying,
if you broke it off with him...

04:00.973 --> 04:04.376
you should at least figure out
what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.

04:04.476 --> 04:07.756
- They're the ones in love with the guy.
- What would Jesus do...

04:08.848 --> 04:12.017
I am no fanatic.
What I am is a fan of God!

04:12.117 --> 04:14.893
...a serpent-headed demon,
shaking you by the...

04:16.322 --> 04:18.267
You wanted the back way home.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.459
That's 10 hours of preachers,
farm reports...

04:20.559 --> 04:23.005
Could you possibly just shut up
and drive, please?

04:23.896 --> 04:27.233
"You broke my heart in two

04:27.333 --> 04:30.770
"Now I can't find the duct tape

04:30.870 --> 04:33.214
"To put it together for you

04:33.539 --> 04:35.074
Come on, girl, sing along now.

04:35.174 --> 04:38.121
"When I met you, I thought I would die

04:38.377 --> 04:40.857
"I wanted to cry

04:41.013 --> 04:43.425
"Didn't know you were evil

04:43.883 --> 04:46.118
"Or that you would hurt me

04:46.218 --> 04:50.223
"Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team guy

04:51.490 --> 04:54.834
"Turns out you're a twit and a real..."

04:56.929 --> 04:57.930
Jesus!

05:01.100 --> 05:04.240
- What the hell is his problem?
- Just get out of his way, Darry!

05:07.907 --> 05:10.319
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?

05:13.579 --> 05:14.887
Go around me!

05:19.285 --> 05:21.153
Get off the road and let him pass you!

05:21.253 --> 05:24.063
- He's nuts!
- I know he's nuts. Pull over!

05:26.725 --> 05:28.160
Go around me!

05:28.260 --> 05:31.400
- Slow down and let him fucking pass you!
- I'm trying!

05:45.978 --> 05:47.150
Jesus!

05:48.113 --> 05:49.421
Shit!

05:49.882 --> 05:52.017
What the hell was his problem?

05:52.117 --> 05:56.657
My first guess? Inbreeding!

05:59.091 --> 06:00.593
Get a load of that nasty old thing.

06:00.693 --> 06:05.142
What is that, the vehicle of choice
for assholes and fucking serial killers?

06:08.600 --> 06:09.806
God.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.810
You know what I just thought of, right?

06:14.940 --> 06:16.476
Kenny and Darla?

06:18.277 --> 06:19.979
They died about a 100 miles from here.

06:20.079 --> 06:23.288
- The same highway.
- This highway runs the length of the state.

06:25.784 --> 06:26.854
You believe it?

06:27.786 --> 06:29.822
That they had to go looking for her head?

06:29.922 --> 06:31.924
That they never found them, only the car.

06:32.024 --> 06:35.301
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.196
Didn't find him or her head.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.098
Look at me, I'm still shaking!

06:39.198 --> 06:42.001
You don't think every generation
has their cautionary tale...

06:42.101 --> 06:44.136
of drinking and driving on Prom night?

06:44.236 --> 06:47.945
I always heard it was true.
Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.

06:49.908 --> 06:51.888
You wanna know something?

06:52.077 --> 06:54.216
When I first heard that story...

06:56.949 --> 07:00.192
I used to think this was the highway
I would die on.

07:00.886 --> 07:03.890
Quite the cheery thinker today,
aren't we, sis?

07:05.591 --> 07:08.731
What's "Poli-Sci Guy"
been doing to you, anyway?

07:10.629 --> 07:12.040
"Beating you?"

07:13.766 --> 07:16.335
That was the license plate
on the van we just saw.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.176
B-E-A-T-N-G-U.

07:19.938 --> 07:22.350
So "Beating You."

07:23.175 --> 07:25.678
That's mine. That's three to five.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.546
- You can't call it now.
- My ass!

07:27.646 --> 07:30.182
- You have to call it when you see it.
- I was in shock!

07:30.282 --> 07:32.751
- Tough!
- What is this, a brand new rule?

07:32.851 --> 07:34.086
It's always been this way.

07:34.186 --> 07:35.788
- Since when?
- Since always.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.723
Since just now, maybe.

07:37.823 --> 07:40.429
- Your memory's for shit.
- No, it's not.

07:49.234 --> 07:50.679
Nah, infinity.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.707
Uh-huh, infinity squared.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.553
- Okay, name it.
- What?

07:59.111 --> 08:02.314
When we made the rule that you had to
call it as soon as you see it.

08:02.414 --> 08:04.451
Would you give it up already?

08:04.850 --> 08:07.186
That's 'cause the rule has always been...

08:07.286 --> 08:09.892
the first person who calls it, gets it.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.499
You talk to Mom lately?

08:12.691 --> 08:15.035
To tell her I'd be home for break.

08:16.628 --> 08:18.039
She sound weird?

08:19.631 --> 08:20.701
What?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.013
Did you listen to her voice?

08:23.202 --> 08:25.239
Could you specify, please?

08:25.938 --> 08:27.178
Forget it.

08:27.339 --> 08:29.410
Did you drink the last water?

08:29.775 --> 08:31.618
The last one was mine.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.750
You are a class act, you know that?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.453
You live off-campus.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.121
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?

08:42.221 --> 08:44.667
What they don't steal, they dye pink.

08:45.557 --> 08:48.527
I've got 12 pairs
of rosy-pink jockey shorts.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.230
Maybe they know something about you,
you don't.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.600
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts."

08:54.700 --> 08:56.577
It's for her, not me.

08:57.603 --> 09:01.608
What? I have to bring home laundry.
If I don't, she gets depressed.

09:02.941 --> 09:05.922
She thinks I don't need her anymore
or something.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.588
I'm serious.

09:08.046 --> 09:10.083
- Goof.
- Bitch.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.186
- Mama's boy.
- Daddy's whore.

09:14.286 --> 09:16.357
- Dick licker.
- Ball sniffer.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.669
- Ass kisser.
- Butt picker.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.371
Repeat. "Ass" and "butt." You lose.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.774
- I think maybe something's wrong.
- You always think something's wrong.

09:35.874 --> 09:40.721
Like you would notice anything past the
point of your own selfish little existence.

09:41.613 --> 09:43.149
She's not happy.

09:44.149 --> 09:46.925
- Not like she used to be.
- Who is?

09:48.287 --> 09:49.664
Mom's not...

09:55.727 --> 09:57.434
It's "Beating You."

10:03.702 --> 10:05.238
What's he doing?

10:08.607 --> 10:10.450
What the hell is that?

10:25.557 --> 10:27.594
What the hell was he doing?

10:28.393 --> 10:30.429
He dumped something down that pipe.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.236
Wrapped in a sheet.

10:33.031 --> 10:34.900
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.072
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.

10:40.005 --> 10:41.740
Just get us out of here.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.542
- Grab my cell phone.
- Where?

10:43.642 --> 10:45.212
It's in the gym bag.

10:54.886 --> 10:55.990
Oh, Jesus...

10:57.856 --> 10:59.699
You gotta be kidding me.

11:03.662 --> 11:06.999
The point of having a portable phone
is that it works when you need it!

11:07.099 --> 11:08.300
I have a power cable for it.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.244
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

11:11.703 --> 11:14.039
Goddamn it, what did I say? My car!

11:14.139 --> 11:15.743
We should've taken my car!

11:17.843 --> 11:20.187
He's coming up right on our ass.

11:27.753 --> 11:32.099
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped up or something.

11:42.167 --> 11:43.373
Darry...

11:46.305 --> 11:49.479
- He's coming up right on our ass.
- What the fuck is in that thing?

11:57.683 --> 12:00.027
You're out of your fucking mind!

12:08.727 --> 12:10.707
What the hell's your problem?

12:17.002 --> 12:20.449
Fuck me! Go!

12:22.174 --> 12:24.552
What the hell's the matter with you!

12:31.650 --> 12:33.619
- Darry, what are you doing?
- Hang on.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.221
Just don't kill us, okay?

13:29.641 --> 13:31.279
Sounds all right.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.214
What?

13:33.412 --> 13:35.647
Like either one of us would know.

13:35.747 --> 13:37.351
I know a little.

13:37.749 --> 13:39.217
Your car makes a strange noise...

13:39.317 --> 13:41.520
you just get a new tape, Darry.
You told me.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.963
I told you?

13:43.555 --> 13:45.432
I learned it from you.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.293
Jesus Christ...

13:49.828 --> 13:51.205
Whoa, wait.

13:52.864 --> 13:57.108
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, okay?

14:01.907 --> 14:05.684
We're both pretty damn sure what
we saw him dump down that pipe, right?

14:07.646 --> 14:10.058
What if it's someone still alive?

14:12.083 --> 14:13.585
What if it was?

14:14.786 --> 14:16.221
Someone who needs help.

14:16.321 --> 14:18.690
We can get help as fast
by getting to a phone.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.859
You have any idea how far
to the nearest phone?

14:20.959 --> 14:22.394
We were just attacked!

14:22.494 --> 14:25.100
And you don't even wanna find out why?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.569
We look in the pipe, that's it.

14:30.669 --> 14:33.905
Is this your idea of a little adventure
or something?

14:34.005 --> 14:36.141
'Cause this is why girls
are smarter, okay?

14:36.241 --> 14:39.578
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do...

14:39.678 --> 14:41.980
we just drive on home and call the cops.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.815
You know that's what we should do.

14:43.915 --> 14:46.054
- Bullshit, I do.
- Bullshit, you don't!

14:46.885 --> 14:49.921
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.

14:50.021 --> 14:51.957
Leave who's ever back there, back there.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.327
Maybe find out later they'd still be alive
if you'd just gone back.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.496
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.

14:57.596 --> 15:02.136
You just wanna go back there see if there's
something nasty at the end of that pipe.

15:04.469 --> 15:05.539
Okay.

15:07.772 --> 15:10.048
And what if it was you back there?

15:17.115 --> 15:18.617
I'm not getting out of this car.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.594
- You don't have to.
- I'm not.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.419
Jesus, it's a church.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.969
What's with all the birds?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.053
I'm just gonna look.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.172
Let's do this and do it fast.

17:40.992 --> 17:42.494
Oh, my God.

17:47.899 --> 17:51.540
- Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
- Doesn't smell like one either.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.508
Come on, you can't see anything in there.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.815
You can see light down there.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.113
Get a flashlight.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.084
Come on, get a flashlight.

18:04.949 --> 18:06.257
Hello!

18:08.853 --> 18:10.662
Anybody down there?

18:13.224 --> 18:17.297
Hey! Anybody down there?

18:25.904 --> 18:27.178
Hello!

18:29.974 --> 18:31.920
Hurry up. Come on.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.122
Hello!

18:36.181 --> 18:37.749
There's someone there, I heard them.

18:37.849 --> 18:39.385
Hello!

18:41.219 --> 18:43.096
You're hearing things, Darry.

18:44.989 --> 18:47.401
Darry, don't even think about it!

18:48.059 --> 18:50.369
- Darry!
- I told you I heard someone.

18:50.995 --> 18:52.664
You know the part in scary movies...

18:52.764 --> 18:55.000
where somebody does something
really stupid...

18:55.100 --> 18:56.935
and everybody hates them for it?

18:57.035 --> 18:58.139
This is it.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.441
- Hello!
- No, Darry!

19:03.541 --> 19:05.343
- Let me slide down.
- God damn it!

19:05.443 --> 19:07.846
- Let me get a little way in.
- You're not going.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.291
I'm not. Just hold my feet.

19:12.684 --> 19:13.992
The feet?

19:27.198 --> 19:28.905
Anybody down there?

19:30.001 --> 19:32.641
When was the last time
you washed these socks?

19:32.937 --> 19:34.575
I see something.

19:35.106 --> 19:37.742
- Hello!
- I am counting to 10.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.010
Something's moving.

19:39.110 --> 19:41.346
Then I am letting go
and going back to my car.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.119
Quiet!

19:43.314 --> 19:45.021
I just saw it again.

19:45.683 --> 19:48.095
Something is definitely moving down there.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.056
Rats!

19:51.156 --> 19:52.533
- What?
- Rats!

19:53.057 --> 19:56.971
Rats!

20:17.081 --> 20:18.526
Darry!

20:21.352 --> 20:23.423
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!

20:26.891 --> 20:28.700
Darry, say something!

20:33.765 --> 20:34.766
Are you okay?

20:41.206 --> 20:43.584
How are you gonna get out of there, Dar?

20:52.817 --> 20:54.387
You suck.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.130
God, I am so sorry.

20:58.256 --> 20:59.792
I bet you are.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.559
I am. I don't know what happened.

21:01.659 --> 21:03.561
You were kicking and I couldn't hold on...

21:03.661 --> 21:05.197
Not as sorry as I am.

21:06.197 --> 21:08.473
There were rats coming at my face.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.772
They were running at me too, Trish.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.849
I feel really bad. Are you okay?

21:20.478 --> 21:23.425
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.761
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.

21:27.552 --> 21:28.929
Thank you.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.592
You were the one who wanted to come
and have a little adventure.

21:34.692 --> 21:35.966
Shut up.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.375
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?

21:52.310 --> 21:53.516
Darry?

21:57.782 --> 21:58.920
What?

22:06.190 --> 22:07.396
Darry?

22:17.902 --> 22:19.506
Say it isn't so.

22:31.282 --> 22:33.159
Did I hear you talking?

22:40.358 --> 22:43.999
Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?

22:44.963 --> 22:46.531
I found our body.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.668
- You what?
- I found our...

23:55.500 --> 23:57.741
What?

24:22.493 --> 24:23.631
Darry?

24:26.864 --> 24:30.004
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!

24:32.837 --> 24:35.113
Darry, tell me what's going on!

24:39.410 --> 24:40.445
What?

24:40.945 --> 24:42.754
We gotta get out of here.

24:43.214 --> 24:45.353
No, let's stay and feed the birds.

24:46.184 --> 24:47.424
Get help.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.689
Get help, Trish.

24:51.322 --> 24:52.323
What are you looking at?

24:52.423 --> 24:55.460
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.528
How are you gonna get out of there?

24:57.628 --> 25:01.405
This is some kind of basement, right,
for the church?

25:04.102 --> 25:06.404
You don't think
I'm going in there, do you?

25:06.504 --> 25:08.940
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see...

25:09.040 --> 25:11.576
tell them to get the cops out here
right away.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.045
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.

25:14.145 --> 25:15.453
And Trish...

25:16.581 --> 25:18.449
if you see that old truck coming...

25:18.549 --> 25:22.361
you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.

25:23.921 --> 25:26.094
You just had to say that, right?

31:37.294 --> 31:39.570
God damn it, Darry!

31:40.798 --> 31:42.277
You asshole!

31:51.675 --> 31:52.847
Darry?

32:12.029 --> 32:14.202
Would you please just say something?

32:25.476 --> 32:27.956
Darry, you're scaring the shit out of me!

32:35.185 --> 32:36.823
We have to stop.

32:40.858 --> 32:42.394
Did you hear me?

32:45.563 --> 32:46.564
Darry?

32:46.664 --> 32:48.371
She did lose her head.

32:50.568 --> 32:54.038
Darla lost her head just like they said.

32:58.709 --> 33:01.519
And you know what he did, Trish?

33:03.213 --> 33:05.284
You know what he did for her?

33:06.650 --> 33:08.994
He sewed it back on.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.136
He sewed it right back on.

33:53.430 --> 33:55.410
You gonna make a phone call?

34:00.704 --> 34:02.540
Throw some water on yourself.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.382
You look like
you just crawled out of a sewer.

34:24.828 --> 34:26.364
He's going back.

34:28.498 --> 34:31.480
He's going back. Come on!

34:39.476 --> 34:40.750
Excuse me.

34:42.079 --> 34:43.922
Excuse me, we need help.

34:47.851 --> 34:50.195
I need you to please call the police.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.496
The police?

34:52.989 --> 34:56.301
We need help now, please!

35:03.967 --> 35:08.040
Just go tell them what you saw
so we can get out of here, okay?

35:09.940 --> 35:11.977
Come on, brat!

35:12.409 --> 35:15.322
I mean it. I need you to hold it together.

35:18.215 --> 35:19.785
Look at me, Darry.

35:22.219 --> 35:23.994
I'm so scared, Trish.

35:27.157 --> 35:28.602
I am so scared.

35:29.426 --> 35:31.030
I'm scared, too, all right?

35:31.862 --> 35:34.231
He's gonna get back to that church...

35:34.331 --> 35:36.470
and he's gonna know that we were there.

35:53.183 --> 35:55.026
Are you gonna get that?

35:59.256 --> 36:01.759
- Yeah, hello.
- Have you seen the cats yet?

36:02.960 --> 36:05.873
- You and your brother.
- Me and my brother?

36:06.230 --> 36:08.870
You and Darry.
I saw you with lots of cats.

36:08.999 --> 36:11.568
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?

36:11.668 --> 36:12.903
Who is this?

36:13.003 --> 36:15.739
Darry?
You know the cats I'm talking about?

36:15.839 --> 36:16.907
Who is this?

36:17.007 --> 36:18.709
You have a torn shirt, right?

36:18.809 --> 36:20.447
And a bloody hand.

36:21.111 --> 36:24.314
Shirt's torn just above
a small rose tattoo...

36:24.414 --> 36:25.893
on your stomach.

36:27.818 --> 36:29.161
Who is this?

36:29.653 --> 36:31.021
How the hell do you know us?

36:31.121 --> 36:33.362
You found its house of pain.

36:34.091 --> 36:35.059
The what?

36:35.159 --> 36:37.227
Those bodies down there...

36:37.327 --> 36:39.530
that's what it likes to call it...

36:39.630 --> 36:41.769
its house of pain.

36:42.633 --> 36:44.635
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

36:44.735 --> 36:48.672
I don't know if it's a demon or a devil...

36:48.772 --> 36:51.275
or just some hungry thing...

36:51.375 --> 36:53.548
from some dark place in time.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.080
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

36:56.180 --> 36:59.821
I just know it's not gonna stop
coming after you...

37:00.284 --> 37:01.786
or anyone else it wants to.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.694
Once it has the scent
of something it likes...

37:10.160 --> 37:11.762
it can't stop.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.035
- Is what...
- What is she saying?

37:14.198 --> 37:16.007
I saw that awful truck, too.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.202
With the license plate.

37:18.869 --> 37:19.903
"Beating You?"

37:20.003 --> 37:22.279
The license plate on its truck.

37:22.773 --> 37:23.774
Right, "Beating You"?

37:23.874 --> 37:25.512
No, think about it.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.613
Think about it, for Christ's sake.

37:29.713 --> 37:31.849
Hold on. I need you to listen to this.

37:31.949 --> 37:36.386
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?

37:36.486 --> 37:40.332
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

37:42.426 --> 37:43.527
Okay.

37:43.627 --> 37:45.800
You hear that song, you run.

37:47.297 --> 37:48.970
And I mean run.

37:49.099 --> 37:52.239
'Cause that song means
something terrible for you.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.584
Something so terrible
you couldn't dream of it...

37:55.806 --> 37:58.616
not in your worst,
most terrible nightmare.

37:58.909 --> 38:00.547
Fuck you, lady!

38:03.547 --> 38:04.548
Darry.

38:14.224 --> 38:15.430
Darry?

38:17.928 --> 38:19.100
Hello?

38:19.963 --> 38:23.172
Let's talk with the cops
and get the hell out of here.

38:38.949 --> 38:42.726
Maybe you should've left out the part
about that phone call.

38:50.327 --> 38:52.967
It just sounds too much like a bad dream.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.840
Everything I said I saw, I saw.

39:00.270 --> 39:03.640
What, you think I bumped my head
down there or something?

39:03.740 --> 39:05.008
I didn't say that.

39:05.108 --> 39:07.088
You believe me, right?

39:08.712 --> 39:09.747
Right?

39:12.115 --> 39:15.062
Look me in the eye
and tell me you believe me.

39:15.686 --> 39:19.930
Look me right in the eye right now,
you tell me you believe everything I said!

39:23.627 --> 39:24.828
We're running the plates...

39:24.928 --> 39:28.102
and we've got some people
on their way out to the old church.

39:28.298 --> 39:31.302
These kids you saw on that wall,
who were they again?

39:32.002 --> 39:34.846
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...

39:35.672 --> 39:36.640
Brandon.

39:36.740 --> 39:40.077
Found their car all smashed up
about 20 years ago.

39:40.177 --> 39:42.623
- Am I remembering this right?
- Yeah.

39:42.946 --> 39:45.756
Those bodies would be
nothing but bones by now.

39:47.818 --> 39:51.595
You said they still had skin on them
and he had a ring on his finger.

39:51.788 --> 39:53.267
What are you saying?

39:53.457 --> 39:55.698
I told you,
I grabbed one of them like this.

39:55.959 --> 39:58.295
And it was hard, like petrified wood.

39:58.395 --> 40:00.397
Like he preserved them or something.

40:00.497 --> 40:03.367
He's got them all stitched together
like some kind of quilt.

40:03.467 --> 40:06.904
- I'm just trying to get all the facts here.
- And I told you the facts!

40:07.004 --> 40:09.239
This guy drives an old brown truck...

40:09.339 --> 40:11.141
and it nearly killed us.

40:11.241 --> 40:14.120
We saw him throw a body down a pipe...

40:14.344 --> 40:16.880
that dumps into the cellar
of that old church.

40:16.980 --> 40:21.156
This guy must have 500,
maybe 600 bodies down there...

40:21.351 --> 40:22.728
and I've seen them!

40:25.822 --> 40:27.233
Stuck up on the walls...

40:27.357 --> 40:31.328
like some psycho version
of the Sistine Chapel!

40:31.895 --> 40:34.431
What, you don't believe me?

40:34.531 --> 40:37.637
Drive out to the old church
if you think I'm lying.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.438
No one's saying you're lying.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.344
Good, because I'm not lying!

40:41.471 --> 40:42.973
Look at this from my point of view.

40:43.106 --> 40:45.746
This is a pretty big story
you're laying on us here.

40:46.810 --> 40:49.791
That's your car
out at the pumps, isn't it?

41:03.493 --> 41:05.973
Bunch of folks saw him from the window.

41:06.596 --> 41:08.701
The man there at your car.

41:11.868 --> 41:14.474
He was standing there at your car...

41:14.971 --> 41:17.281
sniffin' that laundry...

41:18.942 --> 41:21.718
holding big handfuls of it under his nose.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.456
Looked like he was liking it, too.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.658
Which way he run off, Binky?

41:33.790 --> 41:36.100
Still think I bumped my head?

41:40.864 --> 41:43.242
He had time to get to the church,
then back here.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.778
This guy is after us!

41:45.969 --> 41:48.779
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.

41:52.742 --> 41:55.279
And now he even knows my name.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.863
Central, this is 037. Come back.

42:05.155 --> 42:07.192
You interested in a hand print?

42:07.357 --> 42:09.303
037, go ahead, please.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.942
037, this is Central.

42:18.702 --> 42:19.806
Go ahead.

42:22.139 --> 42:24.449
You can dust that, right? Get a print?

42:29.112 --> 42:31.456
Looks like somebody already did.

42:35.452 --> 42:37.693
037, what's going on out there?

42:40.690 --> 42:42.359
037, I need a response, please.

42:42.459 --> 42:45.065
There is definitely some
weird shit going on.

42:45.228 --> 42:47.531
This is Central.
037, that is an affirmative.

42:47.631 --> 42:50.703
We should all just get in the car and go.
We should go.

42:50.867 --> 42:52.369
What is your situation?

42:59.342 --> 43:01.015
037, please respond.

43:08.718 --> 43:11.790
How'd he get to the church
and back to the diner so fast?

43:14.925 --> 43:17.496
What the hell was he doing
with your clothes?

43:18.328 --> 43:20.831
He drives fast, but not that fast.

43:24.267 --> 43:27.407
Maybe he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

43:27.771 --> 43:31.309
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell would've killed him.

43:32.909 --> 43:35.856
Please come back, 037,
out there on East 9.

43:36.112 --> 43:38.490
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.518
You sure that's not a couple of
little pyromaniacs...

43:41.618 --> 43:43.598
you're escorting out there?

43:43.954 --> 43:45.297
Go ahead.

43:45.622 --> 43:47.499
This old church is on fire.

43:48.124 --> 43:50.331
I'm talking burning out of control.

43:50.594 --> 43:53.530
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue,
but I can tell you...

43:53.630 --> 43:56.110
no one's going inside this thing
for a long time.

43:56.299 --> 43:58.040
Incest capital of the world.

43:58.235 --> 44:00.215
Don't be such a snot.

44:04.908 --> 44:07.149
Don't tell me you actually like him.

44:07.611 --> 44:08.715
Who?

44:09.913 --> 44:11.148
Please.

44:11.248 --> 44:13.817
I thought the waitress had dialed
the wrong number.

44:13.917 --> 44:16.397
The guy looked like a strip-o-gram cop.

44:20.090 --> 44:22.070
Like the missing link.

44:22.459 --> 44:26.263
I wanna bring him to my Anthro class
for show and tell.

44:26.363 --> 44:27.501
In sports, the national...

44:34.804 --> 44:35.772
"Jeepers..."

44:35.872 --> 44:38.241
- That's the song!
- What's the matter with you?

44:38.341 --> 44:39.445
The words are the same.

44:39.609 --> 44:42.249
"Creepshow,
where did you get those eyes..."

44:42.379 --> 44:43.780
What is the matter with you?

44:43.880 --> 44:46.759
That's the same song
that lady on the phone was playing!

44:47.784 --> 44:51.425
These kids say the vehicle chased them
doing over 100, go ahead.

44:51.655 --> 44:54.795
A preliminary came back on that dust
you took off the car handle.

44:54.991 --> 44:56.259
It's dead skin.

44:56.359 --> 44:58.168
Long dead. That's why it was powder.

44:58.395 --> 44:59.965
Say what?

45:00.730 --> 45:03.006
That's it! The words are the same, listen!

45:03.133 --> 45:05.409
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those weepers."

45:07.871 --> 45:10.511
Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.

45:21.318 --> 45:24.299
She was playing this song to us,
and she said if we heard it...

45:30.827 --> 45:31.805
This is it.

46:23.513 --> 46:25.117
037, come in.

46:28.752 --> 46:30.789
Are you okay in there?

46:41.331 --> 46:43.572
037, this is Central. Come in.

46:53.276 --> 46:54.584
Trish?

46:54.944 --> 46:56.048
I said hello!

46:56.679 --> 46:58.659
Get back in the car.

46:58.815 --> 47:00.488
Central, this is 04...

47:00.984 --> 47:02.930
Get back in the car, Trish!

48:22.465 --> 48:23.944
What is that?

48:31.241 --> 48:32.879
I'm not seeing this.

48:49.325 --> 48:50.929
What is he doing?

48:56.266 --> 48:57.244
Go.

48:59.903 --> 49:01.974
- I'm trying.
- Go, go, go!

49:05.208 --> 49:07.085
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!

49:54.257 --> 49:56.601
Come on, you're gonna kill us!

49:57.060 --> 49:59.062
I mean it, slow down!

49:59.862 --> 50:01.136
Slow down!

50:10.974 --> 50:12.275
No way.

50:12.375 --> 50:13.683
- There's a phone.
- So?

50:14.110 --> 50:17.717
- So you just told me to stop.
- I didn't say, "Stop." I said, "Slow down."

50:17.880 --> 50:20.216
- How far's the next town?
- You mean the next phone?

50:20.316 --> 50:22.990
It's pretty god damn far.
You wanna wait to find out?

50:43.339 --> 50:46.479
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.

50:46.909 --> 50:48.718
I mean it, come on.

50:48.945 --> 50:51.482
- You don't wanna get help?
- Help from who?

50:51.848 --> 50:53.182
We'll just use the phone.

50:53.282 --> 50:54.918
- And call who?
- I don't know.

50:55.018 --> 50:56.719
- And tell them what?
- I don't know.

50:56.819 --> 50:59.493
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy...

50:59.656 --> 51:02.392
"who pulls tongues out of
severed heads with his teeth.

51:02.492 --> 51:04.403
"Is there a special extension for that?"

51:04.794 --> 51:05.829
Come on.

51:07.263 --> 51:09.743
Christ, do you think
they even have a phone?

51:09.866 --> 51:12.870
I'm guessing no phone and a lot of guns.

51:13.102 --> 51:14.308
Who are you?

51:25.615 --> 51:27.060
I said, "Who are you?"

51:29.585 --> 51:33.260
Patricia Jenner. This is my brother Darry.

51:34.257 --> 51:36.669
- What do you want?
- A telephone?

51:38.861 --> 51:40.238
I don't have one.

51:42.031 --> 51:44.136
I say we keep driving till we see people.

51:44.367 --> 51:46.176
What do you think she is?

51:47.970 --> 51:50.883
What you need a phone for if I had one?

51:51.074 --> 51:53.418
I need to call
the Pertwilla County Police.

51:54.043 --> 51:55.283
Pertwilla?

51:55.678 --> 51:58.921
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.

51:59.148 --> 52:02.095
Then Poho Police.
But I need to call someone.

52:02.952 --> 52:06.623
Don't even think about
bringing the cops out here...

52:06.723 --> 52:09.033
with their zoning crap.

52:10.259 --> 52:14.571
They try to tell me
how many cats people can have.

52:15.131 --> 52:18.840
I'll have as many cats as I wanna have.

52:19.469 --> 52:21.204
You can tell them that for me.

52:21.304 --> 52:23.409
Please, someone's been killed.

52:27.944 --> 52:29.514
Killed, you say?

52:29.979 --> 52:31.856
Yeah, a policeman.

52:32.281 --> 52:34.488
Holy Jesus, I thought...

52:35.051 --> 52:37.588
I thought you meant one of my babies.

52:38.821 --> 52:41.597
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Let's get out of here.

52:44.460 --> 52:48.067
You can call the Sheriff's station,
just don't give them this address.

52:48.564 --> 52:52.512
And tell them to go out on the
interstate where they ought to be.

52:53.002 --> 52:55.278
My babies don't like strangers.

52:56.706 --> 52:58.310
How many babies do you have?

52:59.475 --> 53:00.783
More than a couple.

53:01.878 --> 53:04.324
We've gotta get out of here right now.

53:10.019 --> 53:12.397
Tell me this happens all the time.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.173
Holy shit.

53:48.024 --> 53:50.766
You kids got anyone else with you?

53:51.661 --> 53:53.038
What?

54:03.573 --> 54:06.383
That's not my scarecrow.

54:16.252 --> 54:18.892
You got 10 seconds...

54:19.088 --> 54:22.001
to get your ass out of my yard!

54:24.560 --> 54:27.370
And don't think I'm gonna tell you twice.

54:32.335 --> 54:35.373
- Get the hell away from him.
- What are you doing, Trish?

54:37.673 --> 54:40.085
Get the hell away from him!

54:49.886 --> 54:51.487
Come on. Let's go.

54:51.587 --> 54:53.623
No. Don't you go up there.

54:53.723 --> 54:55.558
- Listen to him!
- We gotta get out of here!

54:55.658 --> 54:58.400
What the hell did you bring into my house?

55:01.497 --> 55:03.170
Get out of here.

55:03.532 --> 55:06.741
Get away from my babies,
you sons of bitches!

55:12.141 --> 55:14.712
I'll blow your fucking head off!

56:04.794 --> 56:06.034
Hello?

56:56.379 --> 56:57.947
- Something's wrong.
- Don't say that!

56:58.047 --> 57:00.316
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!

57:00.416 --> 57:03.022
- Unstick them, Trish!
- You're gonna break it!

57:05.154 --> 57:07.725
- It's stuck in reverse!
- Go in reverse!

57:27.243 --> 57:29.689
- What do we do?
- Hit him.

57:34.183 --> 57:35.628
Hit him, Trish.

57:36.185 --> 57:37.163
Hard.

57:40.089 --> 57:41.067
Do it!

58:13.689 --> 58:15.191
What the hell is that thing?

58:25.534 --> 58:27.445
What the hell are you doing?

58:29.438 --> 58:31.349
Come on, you son of a bitch.

58:34.810 --> 58:37.882
That's right,
walk that ugly face right over here.

58:38.380 --> 58:39.620
Come on.

58:39.982 --> 58:40.960
Come on!

59:04.373 --> 59:06.011
Do you think he's dead?

59:06.575 --> 59:08.418
They never are.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.043
Enough.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.927
Let's get out of here.

01:00:55.517 --> 01:00:56.723
Trish.

01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:04.664
I don't know how much further
this car is gonna go.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.465
Not far enough.

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.277
Roach.

01:01:55.077 --> 01:01:56.954
What are we boosting tonight?

01:01:57.646 --> 01:02:01.253
Why don't you come over here
and find out, Big Daddy?

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.160
'76 Chevy Nova?

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.056
Anyone tell you, for a car thief,
you got taste for shit?

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:09.397
Would you tell Dad
to stop shouting, please?

01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:10.899
Mom!

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:16.205
I understand that, Mother.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.343
I'm just trying to tell you where we are.

01:02:19.601 --> 01:02:22.707
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.

01:02:24.573 --> 01:02:28.919
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.

01:02:30.245 --> 01:02:32.987
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:38.060
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.294
Mom, just let us get home, okay?

01:02:42.057 --> 01:02:44.697
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.300
Me, too.

01:02:47.629 --> 01:02:49.836
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

01:02:55.003 --> 01:02:56.209
Dad.

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.110
Thought I wrecked the car?

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:00.142
She's trailer trash.

01:03:00.242 --> 01:03:01.944
- Pig fucker.
- Booger eater.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.022
Trisha?

01:03:05.814 --> 01:03:07.157
Trisha and Darry, right?

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:09.227
Jez, what are you doing here?

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:11.261
Excuse me, Jezelle?

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.859
Darry.

01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:16.058
Darry Jenner.

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:20.262
- Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
- Come on. They've been through a lot.

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:21.664
- Trisha.
- Goddamn it, Jez.

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:24.967
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.703
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.339
She helped us on a missing persons...

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:31.840
Could I just talk to these kids by myself?

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.677
You go home, turn off that police scanner,
and go to bed.

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:37.379
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:38.947
Go do something useful.

01:03:39.047 --> 01:03:41.288
I mean it, now, leave them alone.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.630
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.

01:03:44.186 --> 01:03:46.723
You don't have to believe a word I say.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.602
But I've come a very long way to see you.

01:03:49.858 --> 01:03:50.826
You know...

01:03:50.926 --> 01:03:53.930
I'm not sure we should be talking
to anybody right now.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.130
Let's go.

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.642
You found all those bodies...

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.043
down in that cellar.

01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:03.011
I saw them, too.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.318
How?

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.553
Dreamed it.

01:04:09.344 --> 01:04:11.585
I dream a lot of things.

01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:15.288
You see the cats yet?

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.456
I saw you with all those cats, too.

01:04:20.322 --> 01:04:21.665
The diner.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.961
That was you. You called us.

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:27.266
Will you excuse me for a second?

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.603
- Darry, I need to talk...
- I need you to listen and not talk.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.471
Truth be, I'd be lying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:37.979
Any good?

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.880
What does that mean?

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:42.547
Every 23rd spring...

01:04:43.712 --> 01:04:46.022
for 23 days...

01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:50.760
it gets to eat.

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:56.828
Eat?

01:04:57.125 --> 01:05:00.129
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.970
You think I like having this in my head?

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:05.974
I don't.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:09.341
I don't like knowing this
and not knowing why I do.

01:05:10.105 --> 01:05:11.607
You said it eats?

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:16.788
Only certain things...

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:19.882
from certain people.

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.250
Just get away from her.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:24.388
It eats lungs so it can breathe...

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:30.693
and eyes so it can see.

01:05:32.661 --> 01:05:35.073
It all becomes a part of it.

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:39.272
Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.813
It dresses like a man...

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:50.756
but only to hide that it's not.

01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:04.536
You hurt it out there on the road...

01:06:05.694 --> 01:06:08.436
but only as much as it can be hurt.

01:06:10.332 --> 01:06:12.312
'Cause it can keep on eating...

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.975
till it isn't hurt no more.

01:06:20.275 --> 01:06:23.654
You've got something it likes, one of you.

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:29.123
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.

01:06:31.453 --> 01:06:32.591
How?

01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:34.098
Never mind how.

01:06:34.222 --> 01:06:36.930
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?

01:06:37.392 --> 01:06:39.167
It needs to scare you.

01:06:39.494 --> 01:06:43.067
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:47.202
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone...

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:50.977
that it might like.

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:56.187
You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway...

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:58.814
trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:01.793
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:06.398
Hello?

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:09.263
We got lights and phones out up here!

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:12.599
Would somebody talk to me?

01:07:12.794 --> 01:07:13.772
It's gone.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:17.108
We ran it over
till there was nothing left.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.013
What the hell,
have we got emergency lights or what?

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:32.214
People, we're going into
a lockdown situation.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.982
That means everybody sit tight.

01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:36.790
Don't move unless
somebody wearing a badge tells you.

01:07:36.985 --> 01:07:39.124
We pounded it to dust.

01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:41.831
We watched it blow the fuck away.

01:07:44.426 --> 01:07:49.000
I think it's eaten too many hearts
for its own to ever stop.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:54.543
Heads up, gentlemen.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:57.316
Let me see some skin.

01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:59.348
Are you in a coma, buddy?

01:08:00.742 --> 01:08:02.311
What is wrong with you, man?

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.780
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.985
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.

01:08:08.316 --> 01:08:10.227
That is special. I love you, too.

01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:13.227
Heads up. Move it, down there.

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.696
Thank you for joining us.

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.133
Show me some skin, that's it.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.805
Heads up, gentlemen.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.756
Okay, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:22.758
We're putting you in a holding room.

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:25.667
You can't do that! He finds you in here!

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.962
He finds you hiding in a room!

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:28.973
You, too.

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:33.773
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?"

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:36.471
- We heard it in the car hours ago.
- No.

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:39.082
It's playing on an old phonograph.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.810
Escort Jezelle here
to the big blue Winnebago...

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:43.879
she's no doubt blocking the driveway with.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.314
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

01:09:46.413 --> 01:09:47.983
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:51.154
I hear it playing
while one of you is screaming.

01:09:51.286 --> 01:09:53.220
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.

01:09:53.321 --> 01:09:55.301
Screaming the last scream
you'll ever scream!

01:09:55.423 --> 01:09:57.232
Goddamn it, knock it off!

01:09:57.793 --> 01:10:00.239
What exactly are you doing here?

01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:04.170
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.834
I repeat, an 11-99.

01:10:05.934 --> 01:10:07.402
This is Tubbs, go ahead.

01:10:07.502 --> 01:10:09.914
We got a situation down here, Sarge.

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:14.713
It's headed towards you,
up the rear stairs. You copy?

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.947
Coming up the rear stairwell.

01:10:17.078 --> 01:10:18.580
Stay here.

01:10:21.716 --> 01:10:24.356
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:10:24.619 --> 01:10:26.223
Come on, I said!

01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:48.110
Somebody down there talk to me.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.588
We have one inmate and one officer down.

01:10:50.712 --> 01:10:52.248
Ramirez, he's hurt bad.

01:10:52.447 --> 01:10:54.825
The son of a bitch
tried to take a bite out of him.

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.258
He what?

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.490
This guy is wearing something.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.196
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch,
but we cannot take him down.

01:11:04.492 --> 01:11:06.261
What do you mean, "wearing something"?

01:11:06.361 --> 01:11:08.272
You'd think I was crazy if I told you.

01:11:08.463 --> 01:11:11.842
This is about the weirdest fucking
body armor you've ever seen.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.304
Where is he?

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:18.111
- Talk.
- He's gone.

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:22.818
He's gone, Sarge.
This guy just climbed up the fucking wall.

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.219
You are not making
one goddamn bit of sense.

01:11:28.316 --> 01:11:31.229
You can put me in a straitjacket,
but this fucker is gone.

01:11:31.586 --> 01:11:34.157
Gone? What the hell you talking about?

01:11:34.656 --> 01:11:36.892
This guy's a real
mover and a shaker, Sarge.

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:38.903
We just lost him on the stairwell.

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:41.103
I can't see! I can't see!

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:44.140
He's heading right up to you. Copy?

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:19.905
Shit.

01:13:21.062 --> 01:13:22.439
This is your way out?

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:25.110
These must lock automatically
if the power's out.

01:13:25.633 --> 01:13:27.374
You didn't know that?

01:13:27.535 --> 01:13:29.304
I don't dream everything!

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:31.611
This isn't everything!
This is our way out!

01:13:31.773 --> 01:13:35.949
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.

01:13:43.618 --> 01:13:45.757
We have to get out of here now.

01:13:47.522 --> 01:13:49.763
There's no other way except the front...

01:13:51.893 --> 01:13:56.171
The front door is out.
Why don't you dream up something useful?

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:59.567
I thought if you knew what I saw,
maybe you could change it.

01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:01.704
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

01:14:07.742 --> 01:14:08.914
You know.

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.617
Don't you?

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.888
You knew when you walked in.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.361
You know who it wants.

01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:26.861
- You know what it wants.
- I've dreamed this.

01:14:26.961 --> 01:14:28.596
You know what's gonna happen.

01:14:28.696 --> 01:14:32.610
You will run up the stairs and hide,
but I don't know what happens to me.

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.405
Jeepers Creepers.

01:14:34.702 --> 01:14:36.648
Jeepers Creepers, right?

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:38.811
Who?

01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:43.288
Who hears Jeepers Creepers
while screaming in the dark?

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.058
Are they ever wrong?

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.363
I don't believe you.

01:14:57.792 --> 01:14:59.060
You don't understand.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.697
Your dreams, are they ever wrong?

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.102
You go to hell.

01:15:04.232 --> 01:15:06.610
I said, "You don't understand."

01:15:06.734 --> 01:15:09.840
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams every wrong?

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.176
She doesn't know.

01:15:11.739 --> 01:15:13.275
She doesn't know shit.

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:19.216
Get upstairs!

01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:21.018
Now!

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:31.003
Our Father, who art in heaven...

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:33.498
hallowed be Thy...

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.526
What in the holy name of God?

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:52.033
Take me.

01:18:54.829 --> 01:18:57.465
You don't want him.

01:18:57.565 --> 01:19:01.012
Whatever you want,
you can take it from me.

01:19:05.573 --> 01:19:07.143
You don't want Darry.

01:19:08.409 --> 01:19:09.615
No, you don't.

01:19:10.511 --> 01:19:12.013
Don't you be a hero!

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.850
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:19.263
You hear me? You take me.
You fucking let him go!

01:19:27.628 --> 01:19:29.665
Please, let him go.

01:19:29.797 --> 01:19:31.970
Trish, please don't do this.

01:19:32.133 --> 01:19:33.806
Just think for a second.

01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:36.106
I won't fight you. You can take me.

01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:38.216
I'm stronger. You want me.

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:50.788
Drop him.

01:19:52.653 --> 01:19:54.599
Let him go and take me.

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:58.292
You let him go!

01:20:09.737 --> 01:20:11.444
Darry!

01:21:10.598 --> 01:21:13.306
Your folks just pulled up outside.

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.984
You never answered him.

01:21:31.018 --> 01:21:33.089
Are your dreams ever wrong?

01:21:35.089 --> 01:21:39.401
Darry screaming in the dark
while that song is playing.

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:41.941
What did that mean?

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:45.878
What did you really see?

01:21:47.768 --> 01:21:49.907
I'm just a crazy old woman.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:53.578
You ask anyone around here,
they'll tell you.

01:21:54.408 --> 01:21:56.115
That's all I am.

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:58.179
Just a crazy old woman...

01:21:58.279 --> 01:22:00.316
with crazy dreams.
