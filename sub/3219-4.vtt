It only works with demons.
And that's it.

Look, I should've said something.
I'm sorry, Dean. I am.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.346
So fire, huh?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.808
The only way I found
to kill these bastards, deep-fry them.

18:22.684 --> 18:26.521
Well, that's gonna be horrible.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.816
-That what you did to Jack's dad?
-Uh-huh.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.030
-Not wasting any time, are you?
TRAVIS: None to waste.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.534
The guy hulks out, we won't be
finding bodies, just remains.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.203
Well, what if he doesn't hulk out?

18:42.955 --> 18:46.707
I did a little homework. I've been
checking out the lore on Rougarous.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.877
What, my 30 years of experience
not good enough for you?

18:50.546 --> 18:54.048
What? No.
No, I just wanted to be prepared.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.844
-I mean, not that you didn't....
DEAN: Sam loves research.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.514
He does. He keeps it
under his mattress right next to his K-Y.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.266
It's a sickness. It is.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.768
Look, everything you said checked out,
of course.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.563
But I found
a couple of interesting stories...

19:08.730 --> 19:13.067
...about people who have
this Rougarou gene or whatever.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.238
See, they start to turn,
but they never take the final step.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.740
-Really?
-See, if they never eat human flesh...

19:19.908 --> 19:22.577
-...they don't fully transform.
-Go vegan, stay human?

19:22.744 --> 19:26.914
Basically. Or, in this case,
eat a lot of raw meat, just not--

19:27.082 --> 19:28.416
-Long pig.
-Right.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.255
Good on you
for the due diligence, Sam.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.257
But those are fairy tales.

19:37.426 --> 19:41.220
The fact is,
every Rougarou I ever saw or heard of...

19:42.097 --> 19:43.139
...took that bite.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.766
Okay, well,
that doesn't mean that Jack will.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.395
So, what do we do? Sit and hope,
and wait for a body count?

No, we talk to him.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.328
Yeah.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.954

I'm sorry.
I'm sure he's a stand-up guy.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.179
But it's pure, base instinct.
Everything in nature's gotta eat.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.640
You think he can stop himself
because he's nice?

20:25.807 --> 20:27.808
I don't know.
We're not gonna kill him...

20:27.976 --> 20:31.812
...unless he does something
to get killed for.

I'm feeling pissed, Jack.

I had to drive myself to the hospital
last night. I was there until 2.

-Maybe he can't. That's all I'm saying.

-See, this is what I mean, Sam.

aren't getting in the way here?

but he's got something evil inside him.

-What?
-Stop the car, or I will.

Wanna know why I've been lying to you?
Because of crap like this.

-The way you talk to me.

like I'm a freak.

-I do not.
-Even worse, like I'm an idiot.

between right and wrong.

You send your friend here.

36:41.532 --> 36:45.076
He tried to burn my wife alive.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.787
What? Why?

36:53.628 --> 36:55.587
He didn't say.

36:57.965 --> 37:02.677
I guess psychopaths
don't know how to explain themselves.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.139
Listen to me. You gotta believe me.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.809
My brother and I,
we never would've hurt her, okay?

37:20.071 --> 37:23.823
-Oh, God, I'm so hungry.
-Jack, don't do this.

37:25.326 --> 37:28.203
I can't ever see my family again.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.625
You two.

37:33.793 --> 37:37.379
-Your friend. You made me into this!
-No one's making you kill us.

37:41.717 --> 37:45.303
Listen to me. You got this dark pit
inside you, I know.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.013
Believe me, I know.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.891
But that doesn't mean
you have to fall into it.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.601
You don't have to be a monster.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.399
-Have you seen me lately?
-It doesn't matter what you are.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.192
It only matters what you do.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.698
It's your choice.

[GRUNTING]

38:26.220 --> 38:27.887

[JACK SCREAMING]

39:14.810 --> 39:17.020
You did the right thing, you know.

39:17.605 --> 39:20.607
That guy was a monster.
There was no going back.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.157
I wanna tell you I'm sorry.
I've been kind of hard on you lately.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.825
Don't worry about it, Dean.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.916
It's just that your psychic thing,
it scares the crap out of me.

39:38.084 --> 39:42.337
Look, if it's all the same,
I'd really rather not talk about it.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.092
What? You don't wanna talk? You?

39:47.259 --> 39:50.470
There's nothing more to say.
I can't keep explaining myself to you.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.139
I can't make you understand.
Well, why don't you try?

39:53.307 --> 39:56.768
I can't, because this thing,
this blood...

39:56.936 --> 40:00.313
...it's not in you the way it's in me.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.315
It's just something I gotta deal with.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.318
Not alone.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.828
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.330
These powers...

40:18.290 --> 40:20.542
...it's playing with fire.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.002
I'm done with them.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.923
I'm done with everything.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.800
Really?

40:30.428 --> 40:33.471
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.598
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.227
Or for the angels, or for anybody.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.064
This is my choice.
