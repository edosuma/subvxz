09:20.959 --> 09:22.667
and you guys don't wanna

09:20.959 --> 09:22.667
tell me what it is.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.959
- Naw, nothings goin' on...

09:24.417 --> 09:26.959
- No, nothing at all...

09:31.959 --> 09:34.041
I didn't mean to do

09:31.959 --> 09:34.041
anything bad!

09:34.083 --> 09:35.583
- What--Jasper don't--

09:35.625 --> 09:37.500
- Oliver choked on a food bar

09:35.625 --> 09:37.500
and passed out!

09:37.542 --> 09:38.333
- Stop talking.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.750
- So I had to either forfeit

09:39.792 --> 09:41.000
or ask Henry to play!

09:41.041 --> 09:42.709
- Ah, nice job.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.125
- I know Henry wasn't

09:42.750 --> 09:44.125
supposed to use

09:44.166 --> 09:45.500
his hyper motility

09:44.166 --> 09:45.500
to play Dodge-A-Leen,

09:45.542 --> 09:47.417
but he said he would play

09:45.542 --> 09:47.417
and we won,

09:47.458 --> 09:49.625
but now I'm scared

09:47.458 --> 09:49.625
of the consequences!

09:51.542 --> 09:52.750
- You've killed us.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.583
- Henry...?

09:55.625 --> 09:57.959
Did you seriously

09:55.625 --> 09:57.959

09:58.000 --> 10:00.583
to win a game of dodgeball

09:58.000 --> 10:00.583

- Well you're

10:11.125 --> 10:12.375
the responsible one.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.125
- I was in the bathroom!

10:15.583 --> 10:16.834
- Why?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.166
- Wh--Why?!?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.166
Because I drink liquids.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.000
- Okay. You promise

10:23.542 --> 10:26.000
to never do it again?

10:26.041 --> 10:27.917
- No, I'm doin' it

10:26.041 --> 10:27.917

10:27.959 --> 10:30.333

the point of the bribe?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.250

12:50.291 --> 12:52.083

12:52.125 --> 12:53.583
in the first place,

12:52.125 --> 12:53.583

15:35.625 --> 15:37.834
still makes me

15:37.875 --> 15:38.959
a little bit faster than you.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.333
- You're not that fast.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.125
- Well, then how did

15:40.375 --> 15:42.125
I pull Schwoz's pants down,

15:42.166 --> 15:43.750
