00:25.500 --> 00:28.400

00:28.800 --> 00:30.700
"A" and an "M". 

00:30.800 --> 00:32.500
- Hi. 
- Hi. 

00:32.500 --> 00:34.800
Hi, look at you! You look spectacular. 

00:34.800 --> 00:36.800
- Thank you. 
- Mr Monk, TK is here. 

00:36.800 --> 00:39.800
- Does'nt she look great? 
- Oh, yeah. 

00:39.800 --> 00:41.000
What's the occasion? 

00:41.000 --> 00:42.500
It's our six months anniversary 

00:42.500 --> 00:44.600
so Leland is taking me to "La Pasteria". 

00:44.600 --> 00:46.800
- Oh, very nice. 
- You been there? 

00:46.800 --> 00:50.200
- No, that's how nice it is. 
- Oh, my God 

00:51.500 --> 00:52.700
What? 

00:53.200 --> 00:55.000
He wants to marry you. 

00:55.000 --> 00:58.900
He's going to propose to you tonight. 

00:58.900 --> 01:00.400
What are you talking about? 

01:00.400 --> 01:03.000
He has something in his pocket, his been
padding it all day

01:03.000 --> 01:06.500
its the size and shape of a ring box. 

01:06.500 --> 01:10.400
Plus, he trimmed his mustache two days
ahead of schedule.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.900
and he has been talking to himself
just now. 

01:12.900 --> 01:15.400
I bet he's rehearsing. 

01:15.400 --> 01:18.700
Plus, he is flossing his teeth, 
which is something he never does! 

01:19.700 --> 01:21.900
Oh, my God, Leland! 

01:21.900 --> 01:23.300
Congratulations! 

01:23.300 --> 01:24.800
Mr. Monk, you ruined the surprise. 

01:24.800 --> 01:27.000
No, I didnt. Im very surprised. 

01:27.000 --> 01:28.300
Wait, here he comes. Dont let him on. 

01:28.300 --> 01:30.100
Dont let him know we know. 

01:32.800 --> 01:34.300
- Hey. Hey
- Hi. 

01:34.300 --> 01:35.500
You look great. 

01:35.500 --> 01:38.400
It's six thirty, 
so we should get ... going. 

01:40.800 --> 01:42.200
Are you okay? 

01:49.900 --> 01:52.100
Why is everybody crying? 

01:52.900 --> 01:54.600
No reason. 

01:55.700 --> 01:57.300
You two have fun. 

01:59.600 --> 02:01.200
What's going on? 

02:01.200 --> 02:05.000
They figured it out. 
That your proposing. 

02:06.700 --> 02:08.400
I wonder how. 

02:10.600 --> 02:12.600
What do I do now? 

02:14.800 --> 02:16.600
I guess I'll just do it here

02:16.600 --> 02:18.400
Wait, no. No, no, no, no. 

02:18.400 --> 02:20.700
Let's just wait until we are alone. 

02:20.700 --> 02:23.000
and I want to hear the whole speech. 

02:23.300 --> 02:26.100
and everything that you've planned. 

02:29.600 --> 02:30.500
Oh. 

02:30.500 --> 02:32.100
Is that a yes?

02:32.600 --> 02:35.100
Well, you'll just have 
to wait and find out. 

02:42.600 --> 02:45.100
Wait, can I take a peek, 
just a little peek? 

02:46.000 --> 02:47.200
Oh 

02:53.500 --> 02:55.900
Looks like we are going to a wedding.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.600
- Are you alright? 
- Yes, sir. 

04:02.600 --> 04:05.200
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but I've 
never seen anything like it. 

04:05.200 --> 04:07.900
- Do you think they killed him first? 
- God, I hope so. 

04:08.000 --> 04:11.200
Peters, Any id at all? 
Fingerprints? Anything? 

04:11.200 --> 04:12.800
You need fingers for fingerprints. 

04:12.800 --> 04:14.700
<i> Heaven, </i> 

04:14.800 --> 04:17.000
<i> I'm in heaven. </i> 

04:17.000 --> 04:20.800
<i> And my heart beats so 
that I can hardly speak. </i> 

04:20.800 --> 04:22.000
Hey. How you doing? 

04:22.000 --> 04:24.700
<i> And I finally found 
the happiness that I seek ...</i> 

04:24.700 --> 04:25.800
Hey there, Kevin. 

04:25.800 --> 04:27.800
You look good. You losing weight? 

04:27.800 --> 04:29.400
Good for you. 

04:29.400 --> 04:33.400
<i> When were up together dancing, 
cheek to cheek. </i> 

04:33.700 --> 04:34.700
Hey, I smell ribs. 

04:34.700 --> 04:36.300
There is ribs. 

04:36.300 --> 04:37.700
You're in a good mood this morning. 

04:37.700 --> 04:39.400
Im in a great mood. 

04:39.400 --> 04:42.300
Im getting married in nine days, 
can you believe it? 

04:42.300 --> 04:45.300
<i> Heaven, I'm in heaven </i> 

04:45.300 --> 04:46.800
and my ... holy monkey. 

04:46.800 --> 04:49.300
Yeah, a couple of hikers 
found him this morning. 

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
Any id? 

04:52.400 --> 04:54.100
No. We got a boot. 

04:54.100 --> 04:56.200
One boot, everything else burnt up. 

04:56.200 --> 04:57.800
One boot? Holy monkey. 

04:57.800 --> 05:00.700
Yeah, figure its a drifter
sleeping in the park, 

05:00.700 --> 05:03.700
some kids come by, they shoot 
him then set him on fire. 

05:03.700 --> 05:06.400
We found a nine millimeters 
shell right over here. 

05:06.700 --> 05:08.700
A couple of kids shot him first? 

05:08.700 --> 05:11.800
Yeah, I think so. His back 
wasÂ´nt as well done. 

05:11.800 --> 05:13.300
You know, so it was'nt rolled around. 

05:13.300 --> 05:15.800
I think most people would
roll around instinctively.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
- You know? 
- Right. 

05:17.800 --> 05:21.400
We found this too. 

05:21.400 --> 05:23.500
Rum. Probably his own bottle. 

05:23.500 --> 05:26.000
Bacardi 151, that will do it. 

05:26.700 --> 05:27.700
Any prints on the bottle. 

05:27.700 --> 05:29.600
No, wiped down. 

05:29.600 --> 05:31.900
Well, the kids would not
have wiped down the bottle, 

05:31.900 --> 05:33.800
There is something wrong here. 

05:33.900 --> 05:36.000
Call Monk, have him 
meet us at the morgue. 

05:36.000 --> 05:37.600
- Yes, sir. 
- You can cover that up now. 

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
Yes, sir. 

05:38.600 --> 05:42.900
<i> I love to go up fishing on 
a river or a creek, </i> 

05:42.900 --> 05:45.200
<i> but I do not love 
it half as much</i> 

05:45.200 --> 05:46.700
<i> as dancing cheek to cheek. </i> 

05:46.700 --> 05:48.400
<i> Oh, heaven, </i> 

05:50.300 --> 05:52.900
Cupid was a gun for hire, 

05:53.800 --> 05:57.400
took aim at Leland Stottlemeyer, 

05:57.600 --> 06:01.000
whose love was wallowed in admire

06:01.500 --> 06:05.400
We love you TK Stottlemeyer! 

06:05.400 --> 06:11.000
Mr. and Mrs. Stottlemeyer. 

06:14.000 --> 06:16.600
Sound a little like "Light My Fire". 

06:18.000 --> 06:19.500
What part? 

06:19.800 --> 06:21.400
The words. 

06:22.500 --> 06:23.900
and the music. 

06:26.600 --> 06:28.700
Why dont you just play the wedding march? 

06:28.700 --> 06:30.400
Yeah, I am during the service. 

06:30.400 --> 06:33.200
But this is for after. 
This is for the reception. 

06:33.300 --> 06:35.700
This is my gift. 

06:35.800 --> 06:38.000
Either that or a trash compactor. 

06:38.800 --> 06:41.700
It cant go wrong with a trash compactor. 

06:43.700 --> 06:45.100
Hey listen, Monk ... 

06:46.200 --> 06:49.200
- Are you ok with me and TK? 
- What? 

06:49.200 --> 06:50.700
I mean, about her name. 

06:50.700 --> 06:52.300
Oh sure, I think it's great! 

06:52.300 --> 06:55.300
Everybody should have 
a Trudy in their life. 

06:55.400 --> 06:57.600
Yeah, thank you, man. 
That means a lot to me. 

06:57.600 --> 06:58.800
There is something else. 

06:58.800 --> 07:01.700
I guess this is as good 
a time as any. 

07:01.700 --> 07:04.100
You and I ... we go way back. 

07:04.100 --> 07:08.600
Probably twenty - odd or even, 
mostly odd years ... 

07:09.500 --> 07:15.900
So I would like for you to be standing 
next to me... next saturday.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.000
Standing next to you? 

07:18.800 --> 07:21.400
Yeah, I'm asking you to be my best man.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.000
Really? 

07:23.500 --> 07:25.100
Wow! 

07:25.100 --> 07:29.500
I'm ... What am I? 
I'm surprised. 

07:29.500 --> 07:32.300
I'm flattered. Slightly apprehensive. 

07:32.300 --> 07:35.800
I'm anxious, which ... 
Well, I am always anxious. 

07:35.800 --> 07:37.600
- So that is not ... 
- So is that a yes?

07:37.600 --> 07:38.500
Yes!

07:38.500 --> 07:41.900
- Yes, absolutely. 
- Okay.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.900
Thank you. 

07:42.900 --> 07:46.700
I'll do my best to be the best. 

07:46.700 --> 07:49.100
The best man that the best 
man can possibly be

07:49.100 --> 07:50.600
I'm sure you will. 

07:51.500 --> 07:53.000
It's not complicated. 

07:53.000 --> 07:56.500
Your main job is to make 
sure you dont lose this.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.500
I will not lose this ring. 

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
I'm sure you wont. 

08:01.500 --> 08:03.800
I will not lose this ring. 

08:03.800 --> 08:06.000
- Monk, I think you're bending it. 
- Yeah. 

08:07.100 --> 08:08.400
Oh, hello Adrian. 

08:08.400 --> 08:11.100
- Hey, how are you? 
- Hey, fiance. 

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200
Hey yourself, what are you doing here? 

08:13.200 --> 08:15.500
Oh, my God, is that a person? 

08:15.500 --> 08:18.700
Yeah. It was a person, they 
found it in Colin Park. 

08:19.700 --> 08:22.400
- Well, who is it? Or who was it? 
- We dont know. 

08:22.400 --> 08:24.900
No, they took his wallet, 
and everything is burned

08:24.900 --> 08:26.800
We'll be lucky if we can 
get a DNA match. 

08:26.800 --> 08:29.200
Oh, God, you have to do this 
every day? 

08:29.800 --> 08:32.100
Honey, I dont teach kindergarden

08:32.100 --> 08:34.200
You knew this when we met. 

08:34.500 --> 08:36.000
Hey, wanna take a walk? 

08:36.000 --> 08:37.600
Oh, I'm okay. 

08:37.600 --> 08:40.700
Actually, I have a favor to 
ask you and it's a little embarrassing. 

08:40.700 --> 08:42.000
Okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Stephanie got arrested last night. 

08:44.000 --> 08:45.300
Who is Stephanie? 

08:45.300 --> 08:47.300
Stephanie Briggs, it's her
maid of honor. 

08:47.300 --> 08:50.100
We are sisters, I mean, 
we feel like sisters. 

08:50.100 --> 08:51.200
What did she do? 

08:51.200 --> 08:53.500
Nothing, it was just speeding. 

08:53.500 --> 08:55.200
- Was she drinking? 
- No, I swear. 

08:55.200 --> 08:57.300
It was just speeding
It was her third offense. 

08:57.300 --> 08:59.200
Okay, where did they take here? 

08:59.900 --> 09:01.200
She's here. Downstairs. 

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
In the holding cell? 

09:02.200 --> 09:04.600
They wont release her until the 
judge comes in tomorrow. 

09:04.600 --> 09:07.900
- So where your car? 
- The impound lot. 

09:08.100 --> 09:09.300
Okay, I'll see what I can do. 

09:09.300 --> 09:11.700
Oh, thank you, thank you, 
thank you! 

09:11.700 --> 09:13.900
- You are my hero. 
- Okay. 

09:14.500 --> 09:18.000
- Meet me outback in half an hour. 
- Bye bye. 

09:19.800 --> 09:22.900
Ah, smell that sweet air. 

09:22.900 --> 09:24.800
Oh, please, drama queen. 

09:24.800 --> 09:26.400
What, where you in there for 
like twenty hours? 

09:26.400 --> 09:28.800
I thought I was having to dig
my way out

09:28.800 --> 09:30.200
She would not dig her way out

09:30.200 --> 09:32.400
because she would have been afraid 
she would break a fingernail. 

09:32.400 --> 09:33.900
Can I ask you a question? 

09:33.900 --> 09:34.700
Yeah. 

09:34.700 --> 09:36.700
What the hell were you thinking? 

09:36.800 --> 09:39.400
You went 75 miles an hour 
in a residential neigbourhood. 

09:39.400 --> 09:41.000
It was an emergency, Leland, alright? 

09:41.000 --> 09:42.700
I had to get to the caterings
before they closed. 

09:42.700 --> 09:44.600
You see, she was doing it for us. 

09:44.600 --> 09:48.000
It's just a wedding, itÂ´s not 
worth getting killed over. 

09:48.000 --> 09:51.100
We ought to getting married on the 
beach, just you and me. 

09:51.100 --> 09:54.100
Something simple in the 
sand. jeans and sandals. 

09:54.100 --> 09:57.000
Weddings are just not for us, 
it's for the families 

09:57.000 --> 09:58.200
You're the boss. 

09:58.200 --> 10:01.400
It's my tuxedo, thank you very much
for picking that up. 

10:01.700 --> 10:03.800
Yes, maybe I should check it, 
make sure it's right. 

10:03.800 --> 10:06.000
Oh, I'm sure it's fine. I rent 
from these guys all the time. 

10:06.000 --> 10:08.300
I cant wait to see you in it. 

10:08.800 --> 10:11.300
Oh, thats nauseating, 
I want to go back to prison. 

10:12.300 --> 10:15.300
- Bye, drive safely. 
- I'll keep it under a hundred. 

10:15.600 --> 10:16.800
Cute. 

10:31.400 --> 10:32.600
Want me to hold the ring? 

10:32.600 --> 10:33.400
I got it. 

10:33.400 --> 10:35.300
Why dont you put it in your pocket? 

10:35.400 --> 10:36.500
Pockets rip. 

10:36.500 --> 10:38.100
How about a drawer? 

10:38.200 --> 10:39.600
- Not reliable? 
- Really? 

10:39.600 --> 10:41.600
I find drawers to be pretty reliable. 

10:42.700 --> 10:43.900
I'd just worry about it. 

10:43.900 --> 10:45.600
You know, I'd obsess over it. 

10:45.600 --> 10:49.300
Probably end up carrying the 
whole bureau around with me. 

10:49.300 --> 10:52.500
You're taking this best man
stuff pretty seriously. 

10:52.500 --> 10:55.200
So how's the bachelor party 
coming? 

10:55.200 --> 10:57.200
Oh, thatÂ´s going great, great. 

10:57.200 --> 10:59.000
I have already bought the beer. 

10:59.000 --> 11:01.700
And I got a movie. 

11:02.700 --> 11:04.100
What? 

11:04.200 --> 11:06.000
I've never seen you so excited 

11:06.000 --> 11:07.800
it is as if he proposed to you. 

11:07.800 --> 11:10.300
I know, thats how I feel. 

11:17.800 --> 11:21.100
You know, It's almost midnight 
I should really really go home. 

11:22.400 --> 11:24.700
Why dont you just sleep here? 

11:24.700 --> 11:25.800
Well, because I have work to do. 

11:25.800 --> 11:30.800
I have a deadline, I have to
review seven blenders. 

11:35.300 --> 11:37.100
Alright, they are just blenders. 

11:42.000 --> 11:43.100
Stay here. 

11:53.900 --> 11:57.900
Wait a minute, Curtis Rudner 
isnt he a pediatrician? 

11:57.900 --> 12:00.200
- Does'nt he have a date? 
- HeÂ´s seperated. 

12:00.200 --> 12:01.800
Well, in this case, Im gonna
move him over

12:01.800 --> 12:03.400
to table number three, 
right next to me. 

12:03.400 --> 12:06.500
Well look at that! Hello Curtis, 
how are you? Sorry, "dibbs". 

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
Actually, Natalie is
bringing her own doctor. 

12:08.600 --> 12:10.100
Yes, Lt. Steven Albright. 

12:10.100 --> 12:12.100
He's in the Navy, he's a medical officer. 

12:12.100 --> 12:13.200
Very nice. 

12:13.200 --> 12:14.700
Ready? 

12:17.400 --> 12:19.000
Okay. Be honest. 

12:19.000 --> 12:20.200
Okay. What do you think? 

12:20.200 --> 12:21.300
Honey, if I looked that good, 

12:21.300 --> 12:24.000
I would get married every six months, 
you know what I'm saying? 

12:24.600 --> 12:25.700
Oh, no, is that the time? 

12:25.700 --> 12:28.800
I have to go, I have to meet
Mr. Monk at the crime lab. 

12:28.800 --> 12:30.900
- God, how do you do it? 
- Do what? 

12:30.900 --> 12:33.600
Your job. How do you live with it? 

12:33.600 --> 12:36.300
The blood, the anger, the victims. 

12:36.300 --> 12:39.600
- How do you get used to it? 
- Oh, well I'm not used to it. 

12:39.600 --> 12:41.500
Lets hope I never am. 

12:41.600 --> 12:43.700
Dont tell Leland, but after 
the break in last week, 

12:43.700 --> 12:45.600
I did'nt sleep for two days. 

12:45.700 --> 12:47.100
Honey. 

12:47.100 --> 12:48.700
I'm serious. 

12:51.000 --> 12:53.500
I dont know if I can be 
a cops wife. 

13:01.800 --> 13:05.400
Monk, the evidence is over here. 
Randy, go get him. 

13:05.800 --> 13:09.500
It's a mixed arrangement. 
There supposed to be mixed up. 

13:09.500 --> 13:12.100
That's the centerpiece for the
tables at the reception. 

13:12.100 --> 13:13.400
Thank you. 

13:13.800 --> 13:17.000
Okay, we have a victim, 
found him in Colin Park. 

13:17.000 --> 13:18.700
He was shot once and then burned.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.700
I read the file, 
so where are we? 

13:20.700 --> 13:22.200
Still unidentified. 

13:22.200 --> 13:23.500
Randy, what do we know about him? 

13:23.500 --> 13:25.500
Well, we know he was ... flammable. 

13:25.500 --> 13:27.200
That pretty much it. 

13:27.900 --> 13:28.900
And this is it? 

13:28.900 --> 13:30.900
- That's all there is. 
- Hey, IÂ´m looking forward

13:30.900 --> 13:32.500
to coming to the bachelor party, tonight. 

13:32.500 --> 13:33.800
What time should I get there? 

13:33.800 --> 13:35.600
Six o'clock. 

13:35.600 --> 13:37.500
The bachelor party starts at six o'clock? 

13:37.500 --> 13:39.900
Be there, or be square. 

13:50.500 --> 13:52.600
Alright, let's see. 

13:54.100 --> 13:58.400
We have a work boot, size 12 and a half, 
maybe 13. So we know he was tall. 

13:59.500 --> 14:01.800
And slightly bow legged. 

14:01.800 --> 14:04.200
The wear on the heel is uneven. 

14:04.200 --> 14:06.000
You're writing this down, Randy? 

14:06.000 --> 14:07.500
Ah, yes, sir. 

14:08.100 --> 14:09.700
What is this? 

14:11.400 --> 14:13.300
A thorn. 

14:13.400 --> 14:15.700
There is no break. 

14:16.300 --> 14:18.100
I think it was cut. 

14:19.800 --> 14:21.200
And this ... 

14:23.600 --> 14:25.400
What is that? 

14:28.500 --> 14:30.700
It's green styrofoam. 

14:32.700 --> 14:34.800
I will send this down to the lab. 

14:34.800 --> 14:36.400
We're in the lab. 

14:37.200 --> 14:39.100
Then I'll just put it right there. 

14:41.300 --> 14:42.500
You know, I can hold that ring. 

14:42.500 --> 14:45.000
I got it. I got it. 

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Truth is I might not be needing 
that ring after all. 

14:50.000 --> 14:53.900
TK is having second thoughts about the wedding. 
Buyers remorse. 

14:53.900 --> 14:55.700
What? 
What happened? 

14:55.700 --> 14:59.000
Well, the break in at my house
really spooked her. 

14:59.300 --> 15:02.200
It was just an B and I, some kid, 
did'nt take anything, 

15:02.200 --> 15:04.900
probably a junkie looking for my piece. 

15:05.000 --> 15:07.900
Now I cant bring it in the house. 

15:07.900 --> 15:08.800
Wow. 

15:08.800 --> 15:11.700
New rule, I have to leave 
the gun in the car. 

15:13.200 --> 15:16.000
Monk, for gods sake, 
would you leave it alone? 

15:16.100 --> 15:18.200
Green styrofoam 

15:20.100 --> 15:22.100
He was a florist

15:26.700 --> 15:27.400
Hello? 

15:27.400 --> 15:31.700
TK Jensen, sorry about the mess. 

15:31.800 --> 15:33.200
Excuse me? 

15:33.200 --> 15:34.900
Sorry about the mess 

15:34.900 --> 15:37.200
Friday night at Lelands house. 

15:37.200 --> 15:38.000
Who is this? 

15:38.000 --> 15:41.600
Tell your boyfriend I'll 
be stopping by again 

15:41.600 --> 15:45.200
Maybe next time 
you both be at home. 

15:45.900 --> 15:47.200
Sorry I'm late. 

15:47.200 --> 15:48.900
Oh, Leland. 

15:48.900 --> 15:50.300
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. 

15:50.300 --> 15:51.700
You okay? 
You're shaking. 

15:51.700 --> 15:53.200
Oh, somebody just called me

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
and he said that he ransacked your place
and he said he'd be back.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.400
Just now on this phone? 
Let me see. 

15:59.300 --> 16:00.800
Did you recognize the voice? 

16:00.800 --> 16:03.700
No, it was weird. 
It was mechanical. 

16:03.700 --> 16:06.500
An electronic filter, 
it could have been anybody. 

16:06.600 --> 16:09.200
Comptel. It was a pay phone. 

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
He knew my name. 

16:12.700 --> 16:14.300
Dont worry about it. 

16:14.700 --> 16:15.900
It's no big deal. 

16:15.900 --> 16:17.900
Just some creep having fun. 

16:18.000 --> 16:20.200
I'll take care of it tomorrow. 

16:21.800 --> 16:23.500
Let's go home and look the door. 

16:23.500 --> 16:26.100
- What about the party? 
- Forget about the party. 

16:26.100 --> 16:27.300
I'll cancel it.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.800
You cant, it's your bachelor party. 

16:29.800 --> 16:31.900
Look, there is no way 
I'm gonna leave you tonight

16:31.900 --> 16:33.500
I'm fine. 

16:33.700 --> 16:35.900
I'll go to the office, I got a 
lot of work to do anyway. 

16:35.900 --> 16:37.800
And there are twenty people 
there, I'll be fine. 

16:37.800 --> 16:39.300
- No. 
- You have to go. 

16:39.300 --> 16:40.100
No. 

16:40.100 --> 16:41.600
This means the world to Adrian. 

16:41.600 --> 16:44.000
He's been planning it all week. 

16:45.200 --> 16:47.200
Okay, I'll go. 

16:47.300 --> 16:50.900
Besides, a party at Monks house  
it will be over by nine o'clock. 

16:53.500 --> 16:55.000
Leland ... 

16:56.200 --> 17:00.400
Does this happen all the time? 
Just tell me, is this gonna be my life

17:01.500 --> 17:03.000
No. 

17:03.000 --> 17:05.900
I swear this never happens. 

17:09.400 --> 17:12.200
Okay, does everybody have pizza? 

17:12.200 --> 17:13.700
There's nothing on it. 

17:13.700 --> 17:15.500
I know! I ordered plain. 

17:15.500 --> 17:17.800
- It's not even cheese? 
- I ordered extra plain. 

17:17.800 --> 17:20.099
No fuss no muss. 
And use your coasters. 

17:20.099 --> 17:24.900
Alright. Large coasters go under
the small coasters. 

17:27.599 --> 17:29.400
And there are trash bags 
in the kitchen. 

17:29.400 --> 17:32.200
Everybody gets one. I put 
your names on the top. 

17:32.200 --> 17:34.700
Monk, there's a bathroom in the bathroom. 

17:34.700 --> 17:36.200
Where do you want me to put him, Mike? 

17:36.200 --> 17:37.800
In the kitchen? 

17:40.000 --> 17:41.600
Great, thank you. 

17:41.600 --> 17:42.700
Well, you were right. 

17:42.700 --> 17:45.900
It came from a pay phone, a 
gas station on Vinton Street. 

17:45.900 --> 17:46.900
Any prints? 

17:46.900 --> 17:49.000
No prints, no witnesses. 
What do you think? 

17:49.000 --> 17:50.500
Someone with a grudge, 
someone you have put away? 

17:50.500 --> 17:52.900
Maybe, it's not a short list. 

17:52.900 --> 17:54.700
How's TK doing? 

17:54.700 --> 17:56.400
She's scared to death. 

17:56.600 --> 17:57.700
Excuse me. 

17:57.700 --> 17:59.600
Okay, alright, here we go. 

17:59.600 --> 18:01.300
Is everybody having fun? 

18:01.300 --> 18:03.300
You mean "is anybody having fun? 

18:03.300 --> 18:04.800
Thats good, good. 

18:04.800 --> 18:07.100
Alright, I would like to say a few words. 

18:07.100 --> 18:10.800
About our friend, Leland 
Francis Stottlemeyer. 

18:12.900 --> 18:14.900
Thank you, thank you very much. 

18:15.000 --> 18:16.900
- Okay. 
- And it goes like this

18:17.800 --> 18:20.500
"A man walks into a bar 
with a duck on his head. " 

18:21.400 --> 18:22.900
It's more, it's more. 

18:22.900 --> 18:26.200
The bartender says, hey are'nt you
Leland Stottlemeyer, 

18:26.200 --> 18:28.800
whose first marriage 
was annulled after five days. 

18:28.800 --> 18:32.100
And second wife, Karen, 
left him after twenty years? 

18:32.100 --> 18:33.700
And then you dated Linda Fusco, 

18:33.700 --> 18:36.800
who was later convicted 
for first-degree murder? 

18:38.800 --> 18:41.900
Wait. Wait. Then Leland says, 
that's right. 

18:41.900 --> 18:46.700
And the bartender says, every relationship
you ever had has ended in disaster.  

18:46.700 --> 18:49.000
And you want to get married again? 

18:49.000 --> 18:50.700
You're crazy! 

18:50.700 --> 18:53.800
No wonder you have a duck on your head! 

18:56.900 --> 18:58.000
Then Leland says ... 

18:58.000 --> 19:00.500
Then Leland says: I need a drink. 

19:01.500 --> 19:03.800
I get it, I get it, you are right. 

19:03.900 --> 19:06.000
Break out the booze! 

19:09.200 --> 19:11.700
And everybody gets a beer. 

19:11.700 --> 19:14.500
Hold on ... Only twelve bottles? 

19:15.600 --> 19:17.400
Everybody gets a beer ... 

19:21.600 --> 19:23.300
Gentlemen, here's the situation

19:23.300 --> 19:26.500
We got twelve bottles, which 
are 144 fluid ounces. 

19:26.500 --> 19:28.900
Which is enough for each of us 
to get a little sleepy ... 

19:28.900 --> 19:30.500
Yeah!

19:30.600 --> 19:33.100
or for one of us to get 
good and polluted! 

19:33.100 --> 19:35.700
Designated drunk . I love the idea. 

19:35.700 --> 19:37.400
I'll be drunk! 

19:37.400 --> 19:39.200
Alright. 

19:39.300 --> 19:40.500
Yeah. 

19:40.500 --> 19:45.000
We'll start a wedding tradition, 
one I'll hope will never be repeated

19:46.200 --> 19:47.800
Alright, I have a question. 

19:47.800 --> 19:49.000
I have a question ... 

19:49.000 --> 19:53.400
Do any of you guys like movies? 

19:53.400 --> 19:56.000
I'm talking about Hollywood movies. 

19:56.000 --> 19:59.600
Because I have found the ultimate 
bachelor party movie. 

20:00.700 --> 20:02.300
It's rated R. 

20:02.300 --> 20:04.500
Everybody here over 18? 

20:05.200 --> 20:07.300
No, seriously: are there? 

20:08.000 --> 20:09.500
Check it out. 

20:13.500 --> 20:15.400
Bachelor Party. 

20:15.400 --> 20:18.400
It's actually called "Bachelor 
Party". Read the cover. 

20:18.600 --> 20:21.800
- "Shocking, shameful" ... 
- That's for you. 

20:21.800 --> 20:23.400
"Sinful" ... 

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
Oh my! 

20:24.800 --> 20:26.800
"And the party has'nt even begun yet." 

20:26.800 --> 20:28.400
Get it? 

20:34.500 --> 20:37.700
He spilled his beer! 
It's all over the floors ... 

20:37.700 --> 20:40.900
And what are they doing, dancing 
on the roof of a car? 

20:40.900 --> 20:43.800
You cant make this stuff up, 
this move is off the hook. 

20:43.800 --> 20:45.700
It's off the hook. 

20:46.100 --> 20:49.000
- And now what's he's doing? 
- He's throwing up. 

20:49.200 --> 20:50.400
It's only a movie, right? 

20:50.400 --> 20:51.900
Hey, Monk ... 

20:52.300 --> 20:55.000
I really appreciate this, 
but I am worried about TK 

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and I want to be there 
when she gets home. 

20:58.200 --> 20:59.800
Sure? Because I bought a pinata! 

20:59.800 --> 21:01.200
- No. 
- Hey, hey! 

21:01.200 --> 21:03.500
Who owns the Crown Vic 
parked out front? 

21:03.500 --> 21:04.800
Was it green? 

21:04.800 --> 21:08.500
No, and itÂ´s like charcoal grey
with flames on the sides. 

21:08.500 --> 21:10.200
And on the roof. And on the windshield. 

21:10.200 --> 21:13.100
There flames on the windshield? 

21:13.100 --> 21:15.100
Flames on the windshield. 

21:22.600 --> 21:24.300
I love this movie. 

21:25.000 --> 21:26.300
Hey!

21:26.400 --> 21:28.300
Hey, that's my car! 

21:28.300 --> 21:31.200
Firefighters are on there way they'll 
be here in three minutes. 

21:31.200 --> 21:36.000
- What is going on? 
- I have no idea. 

21:45.500 --> 21:47.000
How did you sleep? 

21:47.000 --> 21:48.300
Sleep, what's that?

21:48.400 --> 21:51.500
TK wont come to my house cause 
she doesnt feel safe there. 

21:51.500 --> 21:53.300
So we go to her place. 

21:53.300 --> 21:56.100
Two a.m a car alarm goes of,
she gets freaked out 

21:56.100 --> 21:59.600
We ended up spending the night 
at the Bayside motel on route 10. 

21:59.600 --> 22:01.400
She ended up crying all night. 

22:01.400 --> 22:04.100
Whoever this guy is, 
he's ruining my life. 

22:04.100 --> 22:06.200
Well that's supposed to be my job. 

22:06.400 --> 22:07.800
Exactly. 

22:07.800 --> 22:10.200
I got the lab report from the
car last night. 

22:10.200 --> 22:12.800
No big surprise: gasoline accelerant

22:13.200 --> 22:15.400
- Gas can? 
- No gas can. 

22:15.400 --> 22:17.700
- Witnesses? 
- No witnesses. 

22:19.700 --> 22:21.500
So what do you think? 

22:22.100 --> 22:24.000
I think someone is trying to scare you. 

22:24.000 --> 22:26.500
Yeah. But why? 

22:27.200 --> 22:28.300
I mean, it doesnt track. 

22:28.300 --> 22:31.200
If this guy wants a piece of me, 
if he wants to hurt me ... 

22:31.200 --> 22:33.400
why doesnt he come at me? 

22:33.700 --> 22:35.400
What's all this cat and mouse crap? 

22:35.400 --> 22:36.800
So who's on your short list? 

22:36.800 --> 22:38.300
I been at this all morning. 

22:38.300 --> 22:41.400
Most of these guys are 
either in jail or dead. 

22:41.400 --> 22:42.900
Or both. 

22:46.600 --> 22:49.400
No. Nobody is both. 

22:53.400 --> 22:55.100
What about about Joey Knox? 

22:55.100 --> 22:58.000
Remember at that hearing? 
He kept saying it was'nt over.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.400
I already checked: 
Joey Knox is in Mexico. 

23:00.400 --> 23:02.500
But did'nt he have a brother? 

23:03.400 --> 23:05.700
Yes, Joey Knox had a brother. 

23:07.100 --> 23:09.500
- Thank you. 
- Joey Knox ... 

23:12.300 --> 23:14.300
And the brother is deceased. 

23:15.500 --> 23:16.300
What's that? 

23:16.300 --> 23:19.500
That's the burn victim from the park, 
we might have an id. 

23:19.700 --> 23:21.700
We been checking flower shops. 

23:21.700 --> 23:23.800
Remember Monk found that green styrofoam? 

23:23.800 --> 23:25.900
Yeah, I remember, I was there. 

23:25.900 --> 23:27.800
There's a flower shop 
up in Pacific Heights. 

23:27.800 --> 23:30.400
One of there clerks has 
been missing since Tuesday. 

23:30.400 --> 23:32.000
Well, you and Monk go check it out. 

23:32.000 --> 23:35.400
I cant go, cause I'm trying
to save my marriage here

23:36.600 --> 23:38.100
Yes, sir. 

23:39.800 --> 23:43.400
I'm trying to save my marriage 
and I aint even married yet.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.600
You smell that? 

23:46.700 --> 23:48.600
They should open some windows. 

23:48.700 --> 23:52.000
I think it smells wonderful. 
I bet you heaven smells just like this. 

23:52.000 --> 23:54.300
I bet it does'nt. Twenty dollars. 

23:54.800 --> 23:59.200
Hey, hi, welcome to "Affinity". 
I'm Joy, how can I help you? 

23:59.200 --> 24:00.800
Are you the owner? 

24:00.800 --> 24:02.700
I dont like that word "owner"? 

24:02.700 --> 24:04.800
You cant own a 
piece of nature, right? 

24:04.800 --> 24:07.800
Yes, but your name is on the lease, right? 
I mean, It's a store. 

24:07.800 --> 24:11.600
Ma'am, My name is Lieutenant Disher 
I'm from the San Francisco police. 

24:11.600 --> 24:13.800
This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. 

24:13.900 --> 24:17.300
- Oh, this is about Charlie? 
- Yes, ma'am, Charlie Doyle. 

24:17.300 --> 24:19.100
You said he's been missing for a week. 

24:19.100 --> 24:21.200
Yes, a week ago tuesday. 

24:21.200 --> 24:23.700
- How long did he work here? 
- Three years. 

24:23.700 --> 24:25.900
He was my clerk, he made my deliveries. 

24:25.900 --> 24:28.100
And it's not like him to disappear.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.500
He was never even late ... 

24:29.500 --> 24:32.900
- Did he wear tan work boots? 
- Yeah, sometimes. 

24:32.900 --> 24:34.500
And do you have an address for Charlie? 

24:34.500 --> 24:36.000
No! And that is the thing! 

24:36.000 --> 24:38.200
I wish I did, and I dont ... 

24:38.200 --> 24:41.200
- So you dont know where he lived. 
- No. 

24:41.200 --> 24:46.100
Can you check your records? 
I'm sure itÂ´s on the contract. 

24:46.100 --> 24:48.400
I'm not gonna lie to you, 
I have to be honest. 

24:48.400 --> 24:49.700
I'm a truthteller... 

24:49.700 --> 24:53.200
I dont think he ever 
filled out any forms ... 

24:53.200 --> 24:56.600
I just paid him in cash 
once a week, of the books. 

24:56.600 --> 24:58.000
He did'nt belive in banks. 

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
- Well, it's against the law. 
- But, who's law?. 

25:01.000 --> 25:03.800
- Who's law? 
- Exactly! 

25:03.800 --> 25:06.600
So you're not even sure if 
Charlie Doyle was his real name. 

25:06.600 --> 25:11.400
Well, I never asked. For 
instance, Joy is not my real name. 

25:11.400 --> 25:14.200
It's just how I feel ... 

25:15.300 --> 25:16.400
Oh 

25:16.400 --> 25:18.000
I knew it. 

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
I knew it from the moment 
that you walked in here. 

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
You are a butterfly orchid. 

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
- I am? 
- Yes you are.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I believe that everyone has a 
special flower that speaks to them. 

25:33.000 --> 25:36.300
A sort of a floral soulmate, you know 

25:36.800 --> 25:40.600
I am of course a tiger lily. 

25:40.600 --> 25:42.300
Excuse me. 

25:42.800 --> 25:44.700
I think I scared him. 

25:46.900 --> 25:48.900
And you are...

25:50.100 --> 25:52.700
A sweet little crocus. 

25:52.700 --> 25:54.500
Just a bud. 

25:55.500 --> 25:57.300
I always felt like a crocus. 

25:58.200 --> 25:59.100
Yeah, I'm not kidding. 

25:59.100 --> 26:01.600
Yeah! I'm always right. 

26:01.600 --> 26:04.500
- And you are ... 
- Uncomfortable. 

26:04.500 --> 26:07.500
No, dont be uncomfortable. 

26:07.500 --> 26:10.700
Look around you, 
at all the beauty in here ... 

26:10.700 --> 26:11.700
Yeah. 

26:11.700 --> 26:14.600
You know, I think 
something is wrong. 

26:14.600 --> 26:18.700
Your aura is very dark place. 

26:18.700 --> 26:22.800
- Thank you. 
- It does'nt have joy in it. 

26:22.800 --> 26:24.200
Let me think ... 

26:24.200 --> 26:25.800
- Randy, Randy. 
- Your flower ... 

26:25.800 --> 26:27.300
Ma'am. 

26:27.300 --> 26:29.200
Do you happen to have a 
picture of Charlie? 

26:29.200 --> 26:31.100
No, he does'nt like photographs. 

26:31.100 --> 26:34.100
He's a very private person 
and I respect that. 

26:35.000 --> 26:36.400
I know. 

26:36.400 --> 26:38.000
- A fizzle! 
- Yeah. 

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
No. 

26:47.100 --> 26:49.700
- A cactus! No..
- Okay, yeah. 

26:49.700 --> 26:54.200
What about fingerprints? 
Where exactly did Charlie work? 

26:54.200 --> 26:55.700
That's his station there.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.000
Great. 

27:03.100 --> 27:05.000
Are these his shears? 

27:05.000 --> 27:06.400
Has anyone else touched them? 

27:06.400 --> 27:09.500
- I dont think so. 
- Let's rap these up. 

27:11.400 --> 27:13.300
Take the gloves too, the're rubber. 

27:13.300 --> 27:15.400
We can lift some prints off the inside. 

27:15.400 --> 27:18.200
- I found it. 
- Excuse me? 

27:19.100 --> 27:22.000
This is your flower. 

27:22.100 --> 27:24.600
It's plastic. 

27:29.800 --> 27:31.500
I love it. 

27:34.500 --> 27:37.400
- Hello. 
- This is my aunt Nora. 

27:37.400 --> 27:39.000
Pleased to meet you. 

27:39.000 --> 27:40.800
And my cousin Curtis, from Seattle. 

27:40.800 --> 27:42.200
- Pleasure. 
- Leland Stottlemeyer. 

27:42.200 --> 27:44.100
These are my boys, Max and Jared. 

27:44.100 --> 27:47.200
- I heard you guys had a rough week. 
- Oh, nothing we cant handle. 

27:47.200 --> 27:51.300
We never thought TK  would ever 
end up marrying a policeman. 

27:51.300 --> 27:54.400
Well I never thought I end up
marrying a girl like TK. 

27:55.500 --> 27:57.300
- Hey there! 
- Hey, you remember Stephanie? 

27:57.300 --> 27:59.100
She's my best friend. 

27:59.100 --> 28:00.500
- Hi. 
- Nice to meet you. 

28:00.500 --> 28:03.200
Stephanie Briggs, you look younger 
than you did ten years ago. 

28:03.200 --> 28:04.700
Did you make a deal with the devil? 

28:04.700 --> 28:06.900
This is why I love weddings. 

28:06.900 --> 28:09.600
Are you kidding me? 
Thank you TK and Leland. 

28:11.400 --> 28:12.800
You're not even gonna ask him? 

28:12.800 --> 28:15.600
No, Mr. Monk, it's crazy. 
Dont mention it again. 

28:15.600 --> 28:17.000
Hey, how you guys doing? 

28:17.000 --> 28:19.900
Mr. Monk wants to walk 
TKs father down the aile.. 

28:19.900 --> 28:21.700
We are the exact same height! 

28:21.700 --> 28:23.200
I mean, how often does that happen? 

28:23.200 --> 28:26.000
Mr. Monk, I'm sure he would like 
to walk his daughter down the aile. 

28:26.000 --> 28:28.800
She could walk behind us. Just ask him! 

28:28.800 --> 28:31.300
I'm talking about the exact same height. 

28:31.300 --> 28:33.700
Think how cool that would look. 

28:33.700 --> 28:37.300
Look, I've got some news. I just 
got off the phone with Ralph Toplyn, FBI. 

28:37.300 --> 28:40.600
The missing clerk from the flower store,
they ran his prints

28:40.600 --> 28:42.500
his real name is Martin Kettering. 

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
Kettering, I know that name. 

28:44.500 --> 28:48.100
Yes, he's a fugitive. He's been on the 
FBI most wanted list for twelve years. 

28:48.100 --> 28:50.800
He was in a Eco-terrorist group
called "The Earth Avengers". 

28:50.800 --> 28:52.000
I remember them. 

28:52.000 --> 28:54.800
They blew up a bunch of condos
in Denver or something. 

28:54.800 --> 28:57.600
Yeah, wich killed two security guards
and a fireman.

28:57.600 --> 29:01.000
This whole group, Kettering and three 
others has been on the run ever since. 

29:01.000 --> 29:02.400
Is he the burn victim? 

29:02.400 --> 29:05.600
We just got the DNA test back. 
It's definitely him. 

29:05.600 --> 29:09.900
Excuse me. If everyones ready, 
I think we should get started. 

29:09.900 --> 29:14.400
I'd like everyone to line up
just the way you'll be tomorrow.

29:27.300 --> 29:30.900
Mr. Monk, Mr. Monk ... you're
walking too slow! 

29:30.900 --> 29:33.500
Walk normal. 

29:33.500 --> 29:35.000
So you think she'll go through with it?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.100
- Who? 
- TK. 

29:37.100 --> 29:41.400
She's scared to death. You know, 
After the threats and the car bombing ... 

29:41.400 --> 29:44.400
I could'nt marry a policeman, 
even if I loved him. 

29:52.400 --> 29:53.800
Where's our best man? 

29:53.800 --> 29:54.700
Right here. 

29:54.700 --> 29:56.000
Are you angry about something? 

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
No, that's the ring. 

29:59.700 --> 30:02.400
Okay, we'll just wait until the music stops.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.500
Randy. 

30:12.400 --> 30:15.700
- Hey, hey, hey! Randy, You're okay? 
- Yes. 

30:16.400 --> 30:18.000
Get everybody out of here! 

30:18.100 --> 30:20.200
This is Randy Disher. We got 
an explosion in the church in

30:20.200 --> 30:22.500
the corner of Vinton and Third. 

30:22.600 --> 30:23.500
TK! 

30:24.400 --> 30:26.000
TK! 

30:28.800 --> 30:30.200
TK! 

30:31.400 --> 30:32.900
TK! 

30:42.500 --> 30:44.400
Ok, what would you like me to do with this? 

30:44.400 --> 30:47.900
Let us sell it on eBay. 
Mint condition, never been used! 

30:47.900 --> 30:49.500
Sweetie, I'm gonna put it 
in your closet and I  

30:49.500 --> 30:52.500
will also stop by the station 
so I can return Lelands tuxedo. 

30:52.600 --> 30:53.900
Thanks. 

30:56.400 --> 31:00.400
- Everybody hates me. 
- No sweetie, nobody hates you. 

31:00.400 --> 31:02.800
Leland hates me. I can feel it. 

31:02.800 --> 31:04.800
Did you talk to him? 

31:04.900 --> 31:07.200
He offered to quit the force. 

31:07.600 --> 31:11.100
- He did? 
- He gave me his badge. 

31:12.500 --> 31:16.200
I gave it back. It's who he is. 

31:16.300 --> 31:18.000
He's a cop. 

31:18.100 --> 31:21.700
- He bleeds blue. 
- He'd be miserable. 

31:22.200 --> 31:24.300
We'd both be miserable. 

31:24.300 --> 31:28.700
Spending our lives resenting each other... 
What kind of marriage is that? 

31:28.700 --> 31:32.000
Let me tell you: from what I 
seen, it's pretty typical

31:32.000 --> 31:34.600
Okay, how about a drink? 

31:34.700 --> 31:36.800
Oh I'd love to, but I cant. 

31:36.800 --> 31:38.600
When I look back on this 
twenty years from now

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
I wanna know that I was sober. 

31:41.400 --> 31:42.600
Ok, sweetheart, for what it is worth

31:42.600 --> 31:44.000
I think you have 
made the right decision. 

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Leland is a great guy, but you have
got to start thinking about yourself. 

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I mean, my god you been a wreck this week!

31:50.000 --> 31:52.200
And you could not live like this ... 

31:52.200 --> 31:53.700
Oh ... 

31:54.900 --> 31:56.400
You dont agree? 

31:56.400 --> 31:58.700
My husband, Mitch, was 
a Navy pilot. 

31:58.700 --> 32:00.800
He was shot down in 1998. 

32:00.800 --> 32:02.800
Leland told me, I'm sorry ... 

32:02.800 --> 32:07.400
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm sorry all the time. 

32:07.800 --> 32:10.300
But I'm not sorry I married him. 

32:10.400 --> 32:13.800
And you know I thought about this a lot. 

32:13.800 --> 32:19.200
Even if I knew then what I know now, 
I still would have made the same decision. 

32:20.600 --> 32:22.700
We had eight years 

32:22.700 --> 32:25.300
but I would married him
for eight minutes. 

32:25.800 --> 32:29.700
There's a risk in everything. 
That's what life is. 

32:29.700 --> 32:31.600
It's all or nothing. 

32:40.500 --> 32:42.900
I guess I can take that ring back. 

32:43.000 --> 32:44.700
Not yet. 

32:44.800 --> 32:46.200
Monk. 

32:47.500 --> 32:48.700
It's over. 

32:48.700 --> 32:50.700
I happen to be an expert on this subject. 

32:50.700 --> 32:52.400
Well, I'm not giving up. 

32:52.400 --> 32:54.600
It's gonna work out... somehow.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.900
You love her. 

32:55.900 --> 32:58.900
You need her. 
She's your answer. 

32:58.900 --> 33:00.900
She's my answer. 

33:04.100 --> 33:05.100
Where did you hear that? 

33:05.100 --> 33:07.500
Trudy used to say that, my Trudy. 

33:07.500 --> 33:09.000
Besides ... 

33:09.100 --> 33:11.400
I dont think I can open my hand. 

33:13.800 --> 33:15.400
Stephanie Briggs. 

33:16.100 --> 33:18.000
I'm sorry, am I interrupting? 

33:18.000 --> 33:20.600
- No. 
- Are you okay, Leland? 

33:21.000 --> 33:23.800
No, Stephanie, I'm far from being ok. 

33:23.900 --> 33:26.200
Well I'll just be a second. 
I'm running some errands. 

33:26.200 --> 33:29.100
I gotta call the minister, 
cancel catering 

33:29.100 --> 33:30.800
and I need to return your tuxedo 

33:30.800 --> 33:32.500
and take all the vases back to Affinity. 

33:32.500 --> 33:35.600
- And eh. .. 
- Cleaning up the mess, eh? 

33:35.600 --> 33:38.600
Leland, I know this hurts
and I'm really sorry. 

33:38.600 --> 33:42.500
But you'll find someone. 
You got your whole life ahead of you. 

33:43.000 --> 33:45.100
Now you're being cruel. 

33:45.700 --> 33:49.600
Hey, would you tell her to call me? 

33:50.100 --> 33:51.400
Yeah. 

33:51.400 --> 33:53.100
I will

34:01.200 --> 34:03.500
I'm gonna find him, the 
guy that scared her off. 

34:03.500 --> 34:05.400
Him and me is gonna have a long conversation, 

34:05.400 --> 34:08.100
the kind that involves a lot of punching. 

34:09.000 --> 34:11.300
Affinity, the flower shop. 

34:12.100 --> 34:14.600
That's were she bought the 
flowers for the wedding? 

34:14.800 --> 34:16.400
Yeah, that's right. 

34:16.400 --> 34:19.400
Leland, that's where 
Martin Kettering worked. 

34:19.699 --> 34:21.199
When was she arrested? 

34:21.199 --> 34:24.400
- A week ago Tuesday. 
- That was the night Kettering was killed. 

34:24.400 --> 34:25.699
Where did they pull her over? 

34:25.699 --> 34:28.699
Colin Avenue, a mile from the body! 

34:35.199 --> 34:36.600
Stephanie. 

34:37.699 --> 34:39.199
Got a minute? 

34:39.300 --> 34:41.699
Well, actually, I'm running a little late, 
Leland, can't it wait? 

34:41.800 --> 34:43.100
No, it really can't. 

34:43.100 --> 34:46.100
You say you known TK for 12 years? 

34:46.900 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, more or less. 

34:48.000 --> 34:49.600
Where were you before that? 
You never said. 

34:49.600 --> 34:51.699
Who were you before then? 

34:53.100 --> 34:55.900
You ever hear of a group 
called "The Earth Avengers"? 

34:56.600 --> 34:59.100
- What are you talking about? 
- Martin Kettering. 

34:59.100 --> 35:01.000
Is he a friend of yours? 

35:01.900 --> 35:04.500
Leland, listen, I know that you 
have had a terrible week. 

35:04.500 --> 35:05.900
Here's what I know ... 

35:05.900 --> 35:07.600
I know we're going back inside, 

35:07.600 --> 35:09.900
we got a few things to talk about. 

35:12.100 --> 35:14.200
Okay, not today, Leland. 

35:14.300 --> 35:15.900
- Do you see? 
- Easy, easy. Take it easy. 

35:15.900 --> 35:19.500
I'll kill him, I swear to God you 
both know what I am capable of. 

35:19.500 --> 35:22.100
So why dont you take out your gun
and throw it in the garbage can.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.400
And dont be obvious about it, please. 

35:24.500 --> 35:27.300
She's the guy, Leland. She's 
definitely the guy. 

35:27.300 --> 35:30.000
Okay. Stay calm. 

35:30.000 --> 35:31.900
- She's the guy. 
- Okay. 

35:31.900 --> 35:33.800
Okay, Just stay calm. 

35:35.900 --> 35:38.300
You, you take this. 
You're gonna walk me to my car. 

35:38.400 --> 35:40.000
Here we go. 

35:40.800 --> 35:42.800
Just put your hands down, 
just walk naturally. 

35:42.800 --> 35:45.600
Walk like a normal person! 

35:47.700 --> 35:50.300
I bet you a week's pay that 
that is a nine-millimeter. 

35:50.300 --> 35:52.900
It's the same gun that you killed 
Martin Kettering with, right? 

35:52.900 --> 35:54.500
What was it doing with my tuxedo? 

35:54.500 --> 35:56.900
This is what this whole thing
has been about. 

35:56.900 --> 35:58.900
You were in that group 
with Martin Kettering 

35:58.900 --> 36:00.700
you've been a fugitive for 12 years. 

36:00.800 --> 36:01.900
Just shut up. 

36:01.900 --> 36:04.300
I already started, It's very 
hard for me to stop. 

36:04.300 --> 36:05.800
It's true, you have to let him finish. 

36:05.800 --> 36:07.900
- Go on. 
- I'll make it quick. 

36:07.900 --> 36:09.500
Here's what happened. 

36:09.500 --> 36:11.700
You reinvented yourself. 

36:12.100 --> 36:14.300
You got a good job, a new life. 

36:14.300 --> 36:17.100
Then a few weeks ago, you walked
into that flower shop 

36:17.100 --> 36:19.500
and your past caught up with you. 

36:19.900 --> 36:22.400
He had a dead-end job, 
he had nothing to lose. 

36:22.400 --> 36:24.600
You had everything to lose. 

36:25.100 --> 36:27.000
I'm guessing he wanted money. 

36:27.600 --> 36:31.600
You promised to help him. You 
agreed to pay him off. 

36:31.700 --> 36:34.100
So you lured him in to those woods. 

36:34.600 --> 36:38.900
He had no idea he was in
danger until it was too late. 

36:38.900 --> 36:41.000
You killed him in cold blood. 

36:44.100 --> 36:47.700
And after you shot him, 
you burned the body. 

36:49.500 --> 36:51.400
And you were safe again. 

36:55.100 --> 36:57.800
But then it all went wrong, did'nt it? 
On the way home ... 

36:57.800 --> 36:59.700
She got pulled over. 

37:01.100 --> 37:04.400
She still had the gun, the murder weapon, 

37:04.400 --> 37:07.300
she only had a few seconds to hide it. 

37:07.300 --> 37:11.300
She panicked. Just before the 
cops stepped up to the car 

37:11.300 --> 37:15.600
she hid the gun inside the 
garment bag with your tuxedo. 

37:16.900 --> 37:18.600
This was your third 
speeding offense. 

37:18.600 --> 37:22.900
They impounded the car and 
I took the bag up to my office. 

37:24.300 --> 37:26.100
She knew as soon as you'd 
open that garment bag, 

37:26.100 --> 37:28.900
you'd find the gun. 
Which explains the break in. 

37:28.900 --> 37:30.300
She was looking for the garment bag. 

37:30.300 --> 37:31.900
And when that did'nt work she got
desperate. 

37:31.900 --> 37:35.000
- the phone call, the car fire. 
- She was trying to scare TK. 

37:35.000 --> 37:36.400
So TK would call off the wedding. 

37:36.400 --> 37:38.500
- Are you guys done? 
- Actually, no. I have a little ... 

37:38.500 --> 37:41.400
You're done. Get in the car. 
Leland, you drive. And you're in the backseat. 

37:41.400 --> 37:44.200
No, no, no, I never get in the backseat. 

37:44.200 --> 37:47.000
- I only sit in the front. 
- That's true, he can't ride in the back. 

37:47.000 --> 37:49.900
What's your problem? This is a gun. 

37:49.900 --> 37:52.300
- Leland! 
- TK! 

37:52.300 --> 37:54.000
I been talking to Natalie. 

37:54.000 --> 37:56.100
I'm so sorry. 
I was'nt thinking clearly. 

37:56.100 --> 37:57.400
What are you doing here? Just go home! 

37:57.400 --> 37:59.000
We have nothing to say. Just go home. 

37:59.000 --> 38:02.200
He does'nt want to talk to you right now, 
he hates your guts. 

38:02.200 --> 38:05.000
I just wanted to say ... I love you. 

38:05.000 --> 38:06.600
I'm not leaving you again. 

38:06.600 --> 38:10.600
In that case you're coming with us. 
Get in the car, TK. 

38:10.600 --> 38:12.600
Not in front, though. Because I'm sitting there. 

38:12.600 --> 38:14.400
It's okay. It's not loaded. 

38:14.400 --> 38:16.000
No, it's not eh? 

38:18.400 --> 38:20.100
It's empty now. 

38:22.700 --> 38:24.000
Here's your clip. 

38:24.000 --> 38:26.100
You had one in the chamber. 

38:26.900 --> 38:29.000
You are under arrest. Turn around. 

38:29.400 --> 38:32.200
- Ow, that hurt. 
- Good. 

38:42.700 --> 38:45.100
Now you're gonna marry me or not?

38:45.100 --> 38:46.900
Absolutely. 

38:57.500 --> 39:01.500
Trudy, do you take Leland to
be your lawfully wedded husband? 

39:01.500 --> 39:04.100
Do you promise to love him, 
honor and cherish him 

39:04.100 --> 39:07.300
for better or for worse, 
in sickness and in health

39:07.300 --> 39:09.600
for as long as you both shall live? 

39:09.600 --> 39:11.200
I do. 

39:16.800 --> 39:19.500
Sorry, my fingers are a little stiff. 

39:22.900 --> 39:24.000
Open. 

39:25.300 --> 39:27.700
Okay. Here you go. Open. 

39:30.900 --> 39:33.000
I picked the right man. 

39:33.900 --> 39:37.500
And Leland, do you take Trudy 
to be your lawfully wedded wife? 

39:37.500 --> 39:39.900
Do you promise to cherish,
honor and love her, 

39:39.900 --> 39:43.000
for better or for worse, 
in sickness and in health

39:43.000 --> 39:44.600
for as long as you both shall live? 

39:44.600 --> 39:46.200
I do. 

39:58.300 --> 39:59.800
- I now prono... 
- Wait. 

39:59.800 --> 40:02.500
There's something else I 
would like him to wear. 

40:02.600 --> 40:04.700
May I have your wallet, please? 

40:26.000 --> 40:28.800
I now pronounce you man and wife. 

40:29.300 --> 40:30.800
You may kiss the bride. 

40:30.800 --> 40:32.500
You damn right. 

40:46.900 --> 40:49.800
AreÂ´nt you supposed to throw that?
