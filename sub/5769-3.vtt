WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.462
Previously on The Good Wife:
ELI:
We should replace her.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.465
Then don't. Promote her.
Move her laterally.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.637
I'm in.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.501
With Agos, Florrick.

00:09.540 --> 00:10.609
Florrick, Agos.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.505
Look, we can't keep
skulking around.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.428
We have to cut the cord
at some pomt.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.731
People want to wait
for bonuses.

00:15.780 --> 00:16.599
DIANE:
An interview?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.299
On what subject?

00:18.350 --> 00:20.147
There will be questions
about Will.

00:20.180 --> 00:23.183
Peter really needs you to get
the chief justice on your side.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.484
So I trash Will,
or I'm not nominated?

00:45.640 --> 00:49.508
My life is taken up with client
maintenance these days.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.417
Why is everybody
so unhappy?

00:54.380 --> 00:58.419
I gave an interview
to the Law Advocate.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.815
Just now.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.318
I talked about you.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.520
Okay.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.654
They asked about
your suspension.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.420
No, 1-1 talked about
your suspension.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.495
What did you say?

01:13.540 --> 01:16.566
That we were lucky.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.704
We thought you were going
to be... disbarred.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.401
I talked about the money.

01:25.450 --> 01:29.784
The $45,000 that you took.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.209
How we agreed
that it was wrong.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.295
Why?

01:41.800 --> 01:44.667
The chief justice would
only support my judgeship

01:44.700 --> 01:47.396
ifI made a clear
statement.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.630
You talked about the money?

01:56.510 --> 01:58.501
I was sitting there
and I realized...

01:58.550 --> 02:01.314
I... I'm sorry.

02:01.350 --> 02:04.342
I was wrong.
The interv...

02:17.400 --> 02:19.630
Ms. Lockhart?

02:19.670 --> 02:22.730
Ms. Lockhart, Lisa asked me
to give you a message.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.761
Eli Gold called
and wanted you to know:

02:24.810 --> 02:26.732
Don't worry about
giving the interview.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.372
He found another way.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.387
(camera squeals)

02:37.420 --> 02:39.559
WOMAN:
And you have said, Mr. Florrick,

02:39.590 --> 02:42.479
that your governorship will be
the most ethical

02:42.530 --> 02:44.259
in the history of Illinois.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.622
I mean, that's a bit
of a low bar, isn't it?

02:46.660 --> 02:48.298
Given that four
of the last eight

02:48.330 --> 02:50.423
governors have been
to prison?

02:50.470 --> 02:52.199
Well, I've already been
to prison myself,

02:52.240 --> 02:53.593
so I guess
I'm pre-inoculated.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.232
(all laugh)

02:55.270 --> 02:56.703
That's good.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.469
So why don't we try one

02:58.510 --> 03:00.603
with you two kissing
arm in arm?

03:00.640 --> 03:01.800
Oh, no, that's all right.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.772
Just for variety.
No.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.675
These are good.
Shall I bring in the children?

03:04.710 --> 03:06.348
Yeah.
Mrs. Florrick, can you address

03:06.380 --> 03:08.769
the rumors that you two
are still living

03:08.820 --> 03:09.616
in separate apartments?

03:09.650 --> 03:12.710
I can. My career is here
in Chicago,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.978
and Peter's is in
Chicago and Springfield,

03:15.020 --> 03:16.954
so we have residences in both.
We use both.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.390
So when you're both in town,
you stay together?

03:19.430 --> 03:20.249
Anne.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.653
What? That is
a fair question, Eli.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.724
Yes, we do.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.558
In fact, I understand that
you're taking a week off

03:26.600 --> 03:28.761
to go to Hawaii
to renew your vows.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.768
Okay, Anne, are those
really the issues that we want

03:30.810 --> 03:33.233
to be talking about?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.339
Well, there is concern that
you are handpicking members

03:35.380 --> 03:36.745
of the ethics commission,

03:36.780 --> 03:38.372
replacing good people
with yes-men.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.479
ELI:
Really? Concern? From whom?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.374
Well, you fired
Marilyn Garbanza,

03:41.420 --> 03:44.810
one of the most widely
respected ethical watchdogs

03:44.850 --> 03:46.818
(phone rings)
in the Quinn
administration.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.657
Alicia Florrick.

03:48.690 --> 03:49.850
Alicia, it's Kathy.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.654
I'm not calling for me.
It's for Tara.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.928
Oh, Kathy, hi.
Is everything all right?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.791
No. There's been a complication.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.367
We're at Dr. Tuft's office,
and Tara's headed over here now.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.789
Can you come?
I think she'll need you.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.661
Sure. Are you okay?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.302
I'll see you in a minute.

04:07.810 --> 04:10.301
Zach, where's your sister?
I have to head out.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.772
She's right there.

04:11.810 --> 04:14.040
Grace?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.741
Mom, hey.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.509
Oh, Grandma got it for me.

04:17.550 --> 04:18.642
Do you like it?

04:18.690 --> 04:21.409
It's... Wow.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.825
Is that a good wow?

04:22.860 --> 04:25.749
It's a "You don't look
like yourself" wow.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.326
(chuckles)

04:27.360 --> 04:28.520
(rock music playing)

04:31.430 --> 04:33.637
(rock music continues over
headphones, phone ringing)

04:33.670 --> 04:34.967
(lower music volume)

04:35.000 --> 04:36.399
Yes.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.328
Mr. Gardner, this is Mandy Post.

04:38.370 --> 04:39.632
I'm fact-checking an article

04:39.680 --> 04:40.874
I'm writing about your partner,
Diane Lockhart.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.002
(turns off music)

04:42.040 --> 04:44.770
And I was wondering if I
could ask you a few questions.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.675
Sure. Go for it.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.746
Have you stolen any more money
from clients since the $45,000

04:49.790 --> 04:52.418
you took ten years ago?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.779
Actually, that's another call,
Ms. Post.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.708
Can I call you back?

04:55.760 --> 04:56.920
Certainly.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.757
(music resumes playing)

04:58.790 --> 05:02.521
* Ah... we won't be quiet

05:02.570 --> 05:04.697
* Ah... we're gonna get wild!

05:04.730 --> 05:06.834
Kalinda, I need you

05:06.870 --> 05:09.634
to look into Diane's
work on her cases.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.365
What am I looking for?

05:11.410 --> 05:13.571
Any lapses. Any complaints.
Anything she mishandled.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.703
Why? What's going on?

05:15.740 --> 05:18.447
Nothing.
I just need it done.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.915
Wait.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.889
Diane hurt us with an interview.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.480
We need to ask her
to step away from the firm.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.419
And you need her lapses?

05:32.460 --> 05:34.098
In case it grows contentious.

05:34.130 --> 05:35.893
Will, one thing I know,

05:35.930 --> 05:38.023
you look into her lapses,
it will grow contentious.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.565
I need it by tomorrow.

05:43.070 --> 05:46.403
* We're not gonna fight
their way *

05:46.440 --> 05:48.806
* Never ever, ever, gonna
take us down... *

05:48.840 --> 05:50.671
Tara.
Hmm?

05:50.710 --> 05:53.110
Alicia, there you are.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.469
Is it another amnio?

05:54.520 --> 05:56.385
'Cause I have class
In, like, an hour.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.911
Uh, no, I think there's
been some complications.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.884
Oh. Are Kathy and Brian here?

06:00.920 --> 06:01.852
Yes, they called me.

06:01.890 --> 06:03.050
Red Vine?

06:03.090 --> 06:05.923
No, thank you.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.928
I wasn't sure _
after the first amniocenteSIS,

06:07.960 --> 06:11.123
that's why I
requested a second.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.765
The screening detected
an 85% likelihood

06:14.800 --> 06:16.529
of Patau syndrome.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.936
It's a chromosomal
abnormality.

06:18.970 --> 06:21.530
It's very rare.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.105
And I'm sorry,
but very severe.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.038
What is it?

06:26.080 --> 06:28.139
It's a surfeit
of chromosomes.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.946
Most babies with Patau survive
only a few days after birth.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.481
And some less than a year.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.885
All have major
developmental disabilities.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.421
TARA:
But I don't get it.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.484
I felt him kicking.

06:38.530 --> 06:39.849
Last night, all night.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.527
And he will
continue to kick.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.061
There's nothing anyone
did wrong, Tara.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.988
This is not about
the surrogacy.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.190
And what do we do now?

06:46.230 --> 06:49.961
Well, that's why I wanted to get
to you as early as possible,

06:50.010 --> 06:51.966
so you'll have options.

06:52.010 --> 06:55.571
You're in the second trimester,
so... termination

06:55.610 --> 06:58.044
is still a possibility.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.571
I am so sorry.
Shh...

07:03.650 --> 07:04.810
BRIAN:
We'll pay for everything.

07:04.850 --> 07:07.512
Not just the clinic, but the
full amount for the surrogacy.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.413
It's okay.

07:08.460 --> 07:11.486
No, Tara, you're part
of this family now.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.452
We'll deal
with this together.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.592
Dr. Tuft suggested
a clinic.

07:14.630 --> 07:15.597
We'll _make
an appomtment.

07:15.630 --> 07:16.790
And I'll go with you.

07:16.830 --> 07:17.922
No, it's fine.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.938
(phone rings)

07:19.970 --> 07:21.858
(whispers):
Um, Will, can I call you back?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.003
Actually, we need you

07:23.040 --> 07:24.132
for an emergency committee
meeting.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.535
We're short of a quorum.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.639
How far away are you?

07:26.680 --> 07:27.704
Ten minutes,
but I'm with a client.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.106
Come to the office
but go to empty floor on 16th.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.004
Make it when you can.

07:32.050 --> 07:35.144
Of course, the governor-elect
chooses his own commission.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.613
I'll call you back.

07:36.650 --> 07:37.617
Ethics commission?

07:37.650 --> 07:38.878
It'll die down.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.218
They're just probing
for a chink in the armor.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.125
I don't think so.
Bring Marilyn back.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.855
Peter, that will look
just as weak.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.221
No, I made a mistake.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.557
It looks like
I replaced her

07:47.600 --> 07:48.749
because she was
too ethical,

07:48.800 --> 07:49.994
not because of how
shelooked.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.190
Bring her back.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.232
(elevator bell dings)

07:59.640 --> 08:02.200
(people conversing in distance)

08:02.240 --> 08:05.573
DAVID:
Ah, here's our quorum.
How'd you come here, by bicycle?

08:05.610 --> 08:08.545
HOWARD:
What size exit package
are we talking about here?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.116
WILL:
That's what we have to discuss.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.015
DAVID:
Well, if she damaged
the firm, I say

08:12.050 --> 08:13.051
discount whatever
that amount...

08:13.090 --> 08:14.057
With overhead.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.216
I got a call from...

08:15.260 --> 08:16.318
What's going on?
Diane.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.055
...Charlotte Clapton,
one of my biggest divorces.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.194
She got a call
from this reporter

08:20.230 --> 08:21.629
who wanted to fact-check
her article.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.868
Diane, is out for herself.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.595
HOWARD:
So cut her off.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.938
No, we negotiate
an exit package.
What happened?

08:28.970 --> 08:31.165
Diane gave an interview that
exposed the firm to criticism.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.575
We're getting calls
from clients.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.679
We vote_.
How many want Diane gone?

08:33.710 --> 08:35.632
She wants herself gone.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.148
We just ask her to
leave two months early.

08:38.180 --> 08:40.546
All those in favor
of negotiating

08:40.580 --> 08:43.117
Diane's exit package,
raise your hand.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.708
Who's taking minutes?

08:44.750 --> 08:47.810
It-It doesn't matter.
We just count.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.225
Eight to six.

08:51.260 --> 08:54.058
Good. Appointments to
the negotiating committee?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.055
I appoint myself.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.055
You can't appoint
yourself.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.089
I appoint David Lee.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.995
I appoint Howard Lyman
and Will.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.895
And I appoint Alicia.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.737
No. Thank you, though.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.761
We need someone who voted
against the eXIt.

09:04.810 --> 09:05.708
You're the balance.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.776
(overlapping chatter)

09:07.810 --> 09:10.779
CAREY:
Everybody uses
Classic Roman Standard.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.107
We're not saying anything

09:12.150 --> 09:15.347
if you use a font
that everybody else uses.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.644
All of those in favor
of the better-looking font.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.009
Oh!_
I'm joking,
I'm joking.

09:19.050 --> 09:22.281
All those in favor of
Classic Roman Standard?

09:22.320 --> 09:25.881
And all those in favor
of Trajan Pro? Congrats.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.649
Our law firm
now has a font.
Any new busmess?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.918
CAREY:
I heard a rumor I wanted
to share with the group.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.996
Heard that Diane was being
pushed out.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.234
The partners got together

09:35.270 --> 09:37.602
and they're arranging
an exit package.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.608
Which would leave
her clients open for poaching.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.834
If it's true.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.702
As a partner, I am bound
by my confidentiality.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.069
I can't say anything.

09:46.110 --> 09:49.375
Okay. So I'll count to ten and,

09:49.420 --> 09:51.285
if you don't sit down
by ten,

09:51.320 --> 09:52.719
Diane is being
pushed out. One...

09:52.760 --> 09:54.079
Guys, I can't.
I can't even hint.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.781
Well, you did more
than hint when you

09:55.820 --> 09:57.048
told us about
the partners tracrng our texts.

09:57.090 --> 10:00.719
Yes. And I'm not so sure
that was a good thing.
Three, four...

10:00.760 --> 10:02.694
Alicia, we're two weeks away
from leaving.

10:02.730 --> 10:04.766
Getting a jump on her
clients would mean everything.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.759
Six, seven,
eight, nine...

10:08.800 --> 10:10.836
ten.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.303
You can't read anything
into this.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.171
(phone rings)

10:14.210 --> 10:15.802
Who does _Diane have
as clients?

10:15.840 --> 10:17.398
CARY:
Ushkov Industries.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.270
It's $13 million in billables.

10:19.310 --> 10:20.709
Hello.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.638
_ _ KATHY:
AllCla, what did you say to her?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.715
What? Uh, Kathy?

10:24.750 --> 10:27.412
Yes. What did you tell Tara?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.724
Uh, I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.081
She wasn't at the clinic.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.792
I don't want to do it.

10:34.830 --> 10:37.060
You don't want
to terminate the
pregnancy?
Yeah.

10:37.100 --> 10:42.766
You understand that Kathy
and Brian will feel

10:42.810 --> 10:45.233
like you're the surrogate
in this equation,

10:45.270 --> 10:46.874
that they're
the parents.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.400
Yeah. Alicia, I can feel him
kicking.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.806
I don't think he really is
what the doctor says he is.

10:50.850 --> 10:51.805
Would you like me

10:51.850 --> 10:53.738
to set up another appointment
with Dr. Tuft?

10:53.780 --> 10:57.682
No, he'll just say
what he said again.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.416
Tara, he has birth defects.
I know

11:00.460 --> 11:02.781
it feels
like he's healthy,
but he'll be in pain

11:02.830 --> 11:04.718
when he's born,
and he won't survive.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.421
He has a 15% chance.

11:06.460 --> 11:07.791
That's what the doctor said.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.695
That's not
a real chance.

11:09.730 --> 11:11.266
My parents said
I had a 10% chance

11:11.300 --> 11:13.894
of getting into DePaul,
but I'm here.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.293
Tara...

11:15.340 --> 11:17.103
it's not
your baby.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.404
And you are not my lavwer.

11:20.940 --> 11:21.838
Not really.

11:21.880 --> 11:22.949
They're paying you.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.299
Yes, but
I represent
your interests.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.341
I represent
the surrogate's
interests.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.188
Then start.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.710
It's not
your deCI5ion.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.081
Tara.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.348
Tara has decided that

11:34.390 --> 11:36.950
in the best interest
of the fetus,

11:36.990 --> 11:38.287
she will carry
the baby to term.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.388
Excuse me.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.920
This isn't...

11:40.960 --> 11:41.927
We talked about this.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.291
I know.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.798
Kathy, I can't.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.036
He's not sick.

11:47.070 --> 11:48.799
I can feel him.
You're not a doctor!

11:48.840 --> 11:49.659
SCHMIDT:
Okay, hold on.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.759
Page 18 of the surrogacy
contract, Tara,

11:51.810 --> 11:53.368
you specifically
agreed to terminate

11:53.410 --> 11:54.900
if there were substantial
signs of birth defects.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.044
Yes, Tara believes
these do not

11:57.080 --> 11:58.479
constitute substantial
Signs...
What? You have got
to be kidding me.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.909
Tara, this...
You can't do this.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.872
Kathy, Brian, okay.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.080
Really?

12:03.120 --> 12:05.008
And have you explained to her
how she will be in breach?

12:05.050 --> 12:06.210
I have explained
to her her options.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.217
BRIAN: _ _
We're paying you, AliCia.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.182
She's not paying you.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.450
Yes, and as part of
the surrogacy agreement

12:11.490 --> 12:13.355
you agreed to pay me
to act in her best interests

12:13.400 --> 12:15.095
during the course
of the surrogacy.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.064
Tara...

12:17.100 --> 12:20.069
you're hurting us.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.068
You don't agree
with Tara.
It's not about
what I agree with.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.931
So you're just
cashing a paycheck?
No...

12:23.970 --> 12:25.904
I am faithfully representing

12:25.940 --> 12:27.168
the interests of
my client.
And the interests
of your client

12:27.210 --> 12:29.303
involve being the
mother of a child

12:29.340 --> 12:30.546
with major
birth defects?
No.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.172
Ah. So Tara wants
to give birth,

12:32.210 --> 12:35.179
and then force my clients
to raise the child?

12:35.220 --> 12:36.847
My client has made
the choice not to have...
No. No.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.108
...an abortion.
You don't get to use
the word "choice."

12:39.150 --> 12:40.185
That fetus
is wholly

12:40.220 --> 12:41.448
my clients'
genetic material:

12:41.490 --> 12:43.355
their egg,
their sperm.

12:43.390 --> 12:45.051
The only one who
gets to choose

12:45.090 --> 12:46.455
is the actual mother.

12:46.490 --> 12:47.491
We would disagree.
Ah.

12:47.530 --> 12:48.827
And that settles
that, then?

12:48.860 --> 12:50.122
We're suing.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.161
Today.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.192
W-Wha... you're
suing for what?

12:55.240 --> 12:56.389
To force my client
to have an abortion?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.135
How does
that work?
Economic
devastation.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.502
Your client
breached her contract.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.201
The Isenstadts put
over half a million

13:02.240 --> 13:03.377
into this
surrogacy.
Oh, come on.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.570
Searching for
a surrogate,

13:04.610 --> 13:08.046
fertility fees,
Tara's weekly payments.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.547
A half million is going
to bankrupt your client.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.514
Unless she
decides to honor

13:11.550 --> 13:13.154
the terms
of her contract.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.157
Wow.

13:14.190 --> 13:15.179
Then _we'll see
you in court.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.085
No, I won't be
seeing you anywhere.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.085
You're fired.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.348
The Isenstadts
are terminating

13:20.400 --> 13:22.095
your employment
as Tara's lavwer.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.267
Well, they
can't do that

13:23.300 --> 13:24.324
until the surrogacy
is concluded.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.065
No, they can't
do that

13:26.100 --> 13:27.431
until the contract
is concluded,

13:27.470 --> 13:30.109
and you've decided
the contract is concluded.

13:30.140 --> 13:33.177
So unless you're into
doing this case pro bono,

13:33.210 --> 13:34.370
it was nice
meeting you.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.815
(Will and Diane arguing)

13:49.290 --> 13:50.985
WILL:
Not in this context.

13:51.030 --> 13:51.985
DIANE:_
Are you serious?

13:52.030 --> 13:52.894
You put your interests

13:52.930 --> 13:54.227
over the interests
of the firm, Diane.

13:54.260 --> 13:55.227
This is my firm!

13:55.260 --> 13:56.352
It was your firm.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.367
Then get
the security guards.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.958
Carry me out.
No.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.365
We have enough
respect for you

14:00.400 --> 14:01.992
not to make this
a public spectacle.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.447
You want to end
it this way?

14:11.480 --> 14:13.448
Diane,
you ended it.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.539
Now, go be
a judge.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.582
We have work
to do here.

14:43.110 --> 14:44.077
(phone ringing)
Hello.

14:44.110 --> 14:45.077
BOY:
Is Grace there?

14:45.110 --> 14:47.578
No, this is her mother.
May I ask who's calling?

14:47.620 --> 14:48.575
Jimmy Lawrence.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.518
She should be back in an hour.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.381
What is this regarding?

14:51.420 --> 14:52.546
Was that
for me?

14:52.590 --> 14:53.557
No, Grace.

14:53.590 --> 14:55.319
Who's Jimmy Lawrence?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.918
Someone from school.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.949
Why?

14:57.990 --> 14:59.992
Well, he was
calling for Grace.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.467
Zach, is something

15:05.500 --> 15:08.298
going on with
your sister?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.432
No.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.461
But something's
going on?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.501
Zach, what?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.246
Grace has nothing
to do with this, Mom.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.269
It's... it's not her.

15:20.550 --> 15:21.539
(sighs)

15:36.760 --> 15:39.092
But Grace...

15:39.130 --> 15:40.097
I don't understand.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.129
Where...?

15:44.240 --> 15:46.561
So that's why
this kid is calling?

15:46.610 --> 15:48.271
Lots of kids.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.270
ELI:
We want you back, Marilyn.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.641
PETER:
Yes, I thought that we were

15:55.680 --> 15:56.988
a bit hasty in moving you

15:57.020 --> 15:57.941
to the Transit Authority Board.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.742
Promoting me to the Transit
Authority Board.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.655
PETER:
Yes, well,

16:01.690 --> 16:03.351
we heard you weren't
very happy there.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.654
Yeah, I didn't
feel... qualified.
Then come back to us.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.624
We're reorganizing
the ethics commission,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.150
giving it more power.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.622
We'd like you
to head it up.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.561
PETER: And we'd like
to announce today.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.033
In what way, reorganizing?

16:16.070 --> 16:17.765
Well, the ethics commission

16:17.810 --> 16:19.698
has always seemed isolated
here in Chicago.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.629
We want to move your offices
into the governor's suite

16:22.680 --> 16:24.545
in Springfield--
more in the...

16:24.580 --> 16:25.740
heat of the action.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.186
No, thank you.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.778
Wait a minute.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.583
Why not?

16:36.620 --> 16:40.158
Pat Quinn governed
from Springfield.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.418
Rod Blagojevich
governed from Chicago.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.269
Each governor is different.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.790
Where are you gonna
be, Mr. Florrick?

16:45.830 --> 16:48.731
ELI: Oh, he'll be both
here and Springfield.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.738
Then why are you adding
all the offices here?

16:53.580 --> 16:56.674
I'll be in Chicago.
And you want the
ethics offices

16:56.710 --> 16:59.577
isolated out in Springfield?

16:59.610 --> 17:01.077
No, thank you.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.712
What if the offices were here?

17:02.750 --> 17:05.787
Along with unfettered access--
yes, I'd consider it.

17:05.820 --> 17:07.685
(chuckles):
No one gets unfettered access.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.154
Give us a clay to think about it.

17:10.190 --> 17:13.353
Okay?
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.722
They hate me, don't they?
No, I don't think

17:17.770 --> 17:18.794
they hate you.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.764
They want you to consider
all the repercussions.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.735
And they can do that?
Take all my money?

17:23.770 --> 17:25.499
I don't even have that much.
Well, you have

17:25.540 --> 17:27.701
the $120,000 coming
from your parents' trust

17:27.740 --> 17:29.139
when you turn 21.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.478
They can take that.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.141
Excuse me one second, Tara.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.541
Is that her?
Is that the surrogate?

17:38.590 --> 17:42.287
Yes. Look, David, I'm doing this
pro bono, one of mine.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.459
I will not exceed
30 billable...
I'm taking first chair with you.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.321
You're what?
Tara?

17:46.360 --> 17:49.796
Hi. I'm David Lee.

17:49.830 --> 17:52.162
I am in awe of your courage,

17:52.200 --> 17:54.395
young lady.
Life is such
(laughs)

17:54.440 --> 17:57.637
a precious commodity...
isn't it?

18:00.910 --> 18:02.275
What are you on?

18:02.310 --> 18:04.369
Something for Will.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.776
I need you to...
No, come to think of it,

18:06.810 --> 18:07.845
you're still friends with Cary

18:07.880 --> 18:09.416
and the fourth years,
aren't you?

18:09.450 --> 18:11.645
What do you
need, David?

18:11.690 --> 18:14.284
No, that's okay.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.788
Robyn, I want you to look
into this Dr. Tuft...

18:16.820 --> 18:19.789
ALICIA
And you've been seeing

18:19.830 --> 18:21.798
Tara Bach
for how long?

18:21.830 --> 18:24.196
I've been her ob-gyn
for about seven months now.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.891
I see. And when
is she due?

18:25.930 --> 18:27.830
In approximately 12 weeks.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.861
ALICIA: And in your
professional opinion,

18:29.900 --> 18:32.232
is Tara's fetus viable?
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.806
This is
a breach of contract suit.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.774
Well, let's find out the
relevance. What's the relevance,

18:35.810 --> 18:38.404
Counselor? _
If Tara's fetus is Viable,
Your Honor,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.771
then she can't abort, and there
is no breach of contract.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.811
JUDGE: Well, that makes
sense to me, Counselor.

18:42.850 --> 18:43.817
No further questions.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.738
Just a few more
for the defense.

18:45.790 --> 18:46.814
Thank you, Alicia.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.408
What...

18:48.460 --> 18:49.757
(clears throat softly)

18:49.790 --> 18:52.179
Why was the amnio
performed so late

18:52.230 --> 18:54.528
in the pregnancy, Doctor?
Why?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.289
Uh, I-I didn't perform it.
I know.

18:56.330 --> 18:57.592
Dr. Tuft did.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.791
But do you know why
the amnio was performed

18:59.830 --> 19:01.195
so late _in the
second trimester?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.593
DOCTOR: Well, this was
the second amnio.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.165
The first was performed
in April.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.563
DAVID: And did
you find that

19:06.610 --> 19:08.430
Tara had spotting
after the first amnio?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.902
Yes.
And could this
have come

19:09.940 --> 19:11.578
from a poorly
performed amnio?

19:11.610 --> 19:13.817
JUDGE: Okay, let's hold up here.
I'm not sure why

19:13.850 --> 19:15.875
the plaintiff isn't objecting,

19:15.920 --> 19:18.218
but what is
the relevance?
Pure curi05ity, Your Honor.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.808
Well, let's satisfy
our curiosity

19:19.850 --> 19:21.750
on our own time, shall we?

19:21.790 --> 19:26.227
I sustain the objection
that never came.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.956
(sighs) So, you want
to sue the hospital.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.468
I don't want to;
I will sue the hospital.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.730
Their amnio caused
these birth defects.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.635
And you want
the child born?

19:35.670 --> 19:37.831
No. Your client wants
the child born.

19:37.870 --> 19:41.203
Yes, but it means more to a suit
if the child is born?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.208
(chuckles)
$8 million more.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.706
It's pain
and suffering.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.844
$2 million if Tara aborts,
$10 million if she doesn't.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.848
Does Tara know that?

19:49.880 --> 19:51.689
What, that we're suing?

19:51.720 --> 19:54.712
No. She's doing it
because she believes it.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.489
HOWARD:
I'm pro-choice.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.556
It gives you the most options.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.797
HECT: Abortion is a sin.
DAVID: You're a Republican;
you have to say that.

20:00.830 --> 20:01.854
HECT: No, I'm
not a Republican.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.367
I just look at
photos of fetuses

20:03.400 --> 20:04.799
and think, how can
we flush them

20:04.830 --> 20:06.320
down the drain?
DAVID:
No one's flushing anything

20:06.370 --> 20:07.735
down the drain.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.863
I met this Rockette
back the '505.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.300
Looked just like Cyd Charisse.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.898
Oh, God, Cyd Charisse!

20:13.940 --> 20:15.874
Those legs! Oh!
WALLIS:
If men could get pregnant,

20:15.910 --> 20:17.844
abortion would be
a sacrament.
HECT: It's legal.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.643
What else do you want?
We were messing around,

20:19.680 --> 20:21.511
you know, backstage,
the green room.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.984
She came to me
three months later, pregnant.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.908
Are you
kidding me?!

20:25.950 --> 20:27.850
Took her to Canada.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.289
HECT: This is what
I don't get about abortion.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.426
Where do you think
the personality went.
If it had been aborted...

20:32.460 --> 20:33.927
(all talking at once)

20:33.960 --> 20:35.723
Hold on. Hold on!

20:35.760 --> 20:36.692
Quiet down.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.960
We're here to negotiate
Diane's exit package.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.160
DAVID: And I have
some research.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.328
This is what we offered Jonas
Stern when he exited in 2009.

20:43.370 --> 20:45.509
Are you friggin' kidding me?
We were in better

20:45.540 --> 20:46.529
financial straits back then.

20:46.570 --> 20:47.878
We should offer
her half of this

20:47.910 --> 20:49.878
and she'd still
be lucky.
I don't disagree.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.775
Jonas Stern was

20:51.810 --> 20:53.448
a founding partner...
So is Diane.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.947
So was Diane.
She's leaving.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.948
There's no difference
between Jonas's impact

20:56.980 --> 20:58.538
on the firm and Diane's.
DAVID:
That may have

20:58.590 --> 21:00.854
been true back then,
but the firm has changed.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.357
What has Diane done but move us

21:02.390 --> 21:04.881
toward bankruptcy?
David, she's going to be

21:04.930 --> 21:07.023
a Supreme Court justice.
WILL: I agree
with Alicia.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.858
Here's the other problem--
Diane has good clients.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.822
We anger her with
a lowball offer, we lose them.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.337
DAVID: How will
we lose them?

21:13.370 --> 21:15.361
She suggests
they go somewhere else.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.936
Let's be practical.

21:16.970 --> 21:22.806
We offer a fair amount;
we keep her clients with us.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.003
Tara's fetus won't be viable
until the third trimester.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.870
And that's in 48 hours?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.445
Yes, that's why the
decision to terminate

21:30.490 --> 21:31.718
has to be made quickly.

21:31.750 --> 21:35.914
Now, Tara's ob-gyn has suggested
that the fetus is viable now.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.450
Yes, I heard that.
She's wrong.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.026
Viability is based
on survivability

21:39.060 --> 21:40.550
outside Tara's womb.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.022
And that's why the Supreme Court

21:42.060 --> 21:44.927
in Roe v. Wade established
the beginning of
the third trimester

21:44.970 --> 21:47.393
as an inviolable line?
Yes, exactly.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.930
Thank you, Doctor.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.961
Nothing further.

21:52.870 --> 21:56.431
Dr. Tuft, isn't survivability
based on current technology?

21:56.480 --> 21:58.869
Of course.
And given the
current improvements

21:58.910 --> 22:00.946
in postnatal technology,

22:00.980 --> 22:03.949
can't the fetus survive_
out5ide Tara's womb earlier?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.082
Not in my opinion, no.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.883
This is a very
special case.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.559
Doctor, don't you have a reason
for wanting the fetus aborted?

22:09.590 --> 22:10.659
SCHMIDT:
Excuse me, objection,
Your Honor.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.123
Who's questioning the witness?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.424
If the fetus is aborted,
then the malpractice lawsuit

22:14.460 --> 22:16.394
against you will be reduced.
Objection, Your Honor!

22:16.430 --> 22:18.523
The defense is turning this into
an argument about malpractice.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.197
No, no, no, you don't have...
We all know you're excited
to be in big boy court.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.892
If you have a problem with me...
You might want to check
the laws on slander, sir.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.761
I'm not slandering the witness,
I'm asking him a...
You're saying...

22:27.010 --> 22:29.570
JUDGE:
The question before me

22:29.610 --> 22:31.999
is whether this contract
is moot.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.972
Due to fetal viability,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.011
there's no way
not to be in breach.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.644
Given the conflicting testimony
of the doctors,

22:38.690 --> 22:40.419
I have no way to split this...

22:40.460 --> 22:42.155
uh, dilemma.

22:42.190 --> 22:45.387
So I fall back on the
Supreme Court's deCI5ion.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.749
Damn it.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.395
JUDGE:
With respect to the contract
in question,

22:49.430 --> 22:51.967
the fetus is ruled nonviable

22:52.000 --> 22:54.389
and will remain so
for 40 more hours.
Your Honor?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.068
Given that, we move that these
proceedings continue apace.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.102
Uh, Your Honor, we don't have
our next witness until Friday.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.573
Mrs. Florrick.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.931
Have your witnesses
available this afternoon.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.868
Or we will proceed
without them.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.377
(gavelbangs)

23:08.680 --> 23:10.910
No.

23:10.950 --> 23:12.110
HOWARD:
What does that mean?

23:12.150 --> 23:15.119
It means I don't accept
your exit package.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.685
We can shove you out,
you know.

23:17.730 --> 23:18.924
Yes, I do know that.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.520
And my clients, too.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.788
What is that-- a threat?

23:22.830 --> 23:23.967
It is a fact.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.865
Don't act innocent.

23:25.900 --> 23:28.164
You already have some of the
associates calling my clients,

23:28.200 --> 23:31.101
trying to split them off.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.232
You're paranoid, Diane.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.002
And I am not Jonas Stern.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.805
What do you want, Diane?

23:39.850 --> 23:41.841
I want what I'm worth.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.019
You want me to not bad
talk you to my clients,

23:44.050 --> 23:45.142
rethink your offer.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.011
Now get out of my office.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.755
This isn't your office.

23:49.790 --> 23:50.859
It is.

23:50.890 --> 23:53.029
Until you have the security
guards escort me out.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.164
Alicia?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.189
Do you have a minute?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.435
I... Sure.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.874
I can't decide this by myself.

24:08.910 --> 24:11.071
But I can sway
most of the partners.

24:11.110 --> 24:12.998
And I think you'll enjoy
a honeymoon period

24:13.050 --> 24:14.119
as the governor's wife.

24:14.150 --> 24:16.846
Oh... okay.
I'm not...

24:16.880 --> 24:20.111
I want you to consider replacing
Diane as managing partner.

24:29.260 --> 24:32.058
Tara asked a lot of questions
about the contract.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.489
We listened, made changes
at her request.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.100
We wanted her
to feel part of the process.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.937
SCHMIDT:
And who represented Ms. Bach?

24:38.970 --> 24:40.232
Alicia Florrick.
I see.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.740
And did Mrs. Florrick
ever raise any concerns

24:43.780 --> 24:46.248
that the surrogacy contract
was coercive in any way?

24:46.280 --> 24:48.612
Your Honor,
respondent would stipulate

24:48.650 --> 24:50.811
that the contract _
as a whole is not coerCIve.

24:50.850 --> 24:53.216
This is about
a Single prOVI5ion.
Yes.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.649
Now that Mrs. Florrick
has given herself cover

24:54.690 --> 24:55.657
against a malpractice suit,

24:55.690 --> 24:57.282
may I continue?

24:57.320 --> 25:00.084
The provision regarding
your right

25:00.130 --> 25:01.722
to terminate the pregnancy,

25:01.760 --> 25:04.069
that wasn't part
of the standard agency contract.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.260
Was it?
No.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.267
My husband and I insisted on it.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.734
Why?

25:08.770 --> 25:11.603
Because our first child, Caleb,
had a heart defect.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.198
He lived six months.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.174
Five operations.

25:15.210 --> 25:16.370
And in the end, we just...

25:16.410 --> 25:19.208
we couldn't bring another
child into the world to suffer.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.969
And is that why you want
to terminate this pregnancy?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.911
Yes.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.727
I wish I were the one
that were pregnant.

25:30.760 --> 25:34.548
But I'm not.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.852
But it's our child.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.162
Our choice.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.197
No one should be allowed
to take that from us.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.707
PETER:
What I want

25:43.740 --> 25:45.332
is a proposed budget
before the state assembly...

25:45.370 --> 25:48.237
So, Barry Rovinski's company
owns the building

25:48.280 --> 25:51.704
that Alicia's new fi_rm
just leased space in?

25:51.750 --> 25:55.277
Yes, an obvious
conflict of interest.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.016
I assure you neither
Peter nor Alicia knew that

25:58.050 --> 26:00.280
when he appointed Barry
to the water board.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.355
Yes, but the terms of
the lease might be

26:01.390 --> 26:02.948
considered preferential.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.958
25 a square foot in an area

26:04.990 --> 26:07.049
where 40's the market rate?

26:07.090 --> 26:08.728
What would you
have Peter do?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.227
The lease has already
been executed.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.194
I think he should reconsider

26:12.230 --> 26:14.232
Barry's candidacy.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.639
He'll look into it.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.829
I was promised
unfettered access.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.131
All due respect,

26:23.180 --> 26:24.147
you are not the
governor-elect.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.374
Yes, thank you
for your respect.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.241
And this is unfettered access

26:27.280 --> 26:28.315
to the governor's
chief of staff.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.308
We should be on
the same side, Eli.

26:31.350 --> 26:32.886
We are on the same side.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.319
You can't keep
disagreeing with me

26:34.360 --> 26:35.258
and pretend it's an agreement.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.087
I agree.
(laughs)

26:37.120 --> 26:39.179
Okay.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.993
Ethical issues
are never obVIous

26:41.030 --> 26:42.156
and they never go away.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.191
That's why I raise them.

26:44.230 --> 26:45.868
Because I like Peter and
want to see him succeed.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.162
You mean, Mr. Florrick?

26:48.700 --> 26:50.702
Of course.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.871
ALICIA:
Mrs. Isenstadt,

26:53.910 --> 26:56.902
you believe you and your husband
have absolute autonomy

26:56.940 --> 26:58.043
over the fate of this...

26:58.080 --> 26:59.274
fetus, right?

26:59.310 --> 27:01.210
Yes, I do.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.070
Why is that?

27:03.120 --> 27:04.382
Because it's ours.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.387
And what about your body?

27:05.420 --> 27:06.842
Do you think you should
have control over that?

27:06.890 --> 27:08.152
Over my body?

27:08.190 --> 27:09.259
Yes, I do.

27:09.290 --> 27:10.848
So, you're pro-choice?

27:10.890 --> 27:13.188
Yes, but this is different.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.118
How? How is it different?

27:15.160 --> 27:17.128
You want this contract imposed

27:17.160 --> 27:18.798
even though Tara

27:18.830 --> 27:20.366
doesn't want an abortion.
It's different

27:20.400 --> 27:22.436
because Tara is not the mother.

27:22.470 --> 27:25.064
I'm the mother.
But it's her body.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.759
Objection, argumentative.
It's okay, I...

27:26.810 --> 27:27.777
I want to answer.

27:27.810 --> 27:30.335
Yes, it's her body,

27:30.380 --> 27:33.099
but she has agreed
to subject her body

27:33.150 --> 27:35.414
to my needs as a mother.

27:35.450 --> 27:39.045
The mother--
that's what this contract was.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.957
This is about my choice,
not hers.

27:41.990 --> 27:45.357
So you would drag Tara
to a clinic

27:45.390 --> 27:47.358
and have this fetus

27:47.390 --> 27:49.654
forcibly removed?

27:54.100 --> 27:56.432
Withdrawn.

27:56.470 --> 27:57.664
No more questions.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.704
I'll have a ruling on the
contract's enforceability

28:03.750 --> 28:05.172
within the hour.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.985
(exhales)

28:24.430 --> 28:25.727
(knocking)

28:25.770 --> 28:27.829
Yeah.

28:27.870 --> 28:29.360
Uh, Cary, I have to be
in court in ten minutes.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.402
What do you need?

28:32.540 --> 28:34.337
Are taking
the managing partnership?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.205
Where'd you hear that?

28:37.240 --> 28:38.468
Is it true?

28:41.950 --> 28:43.747
Will offered it to me.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.018
But it's not a sure thing.

28:45.050 --> 28:47.143
And I don't know even
ifI would take it.

28:47.190 --> 28:49.385
But you're considering it?

28:49.420 --> 28:50.785
Don't you think
that would've been

28:50.830 --> 28:51.979
a good thing to tell us?

28:52.030 --> 28:54.055
It just happened.
Alicia.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.358
Staying is a mistake.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.198
You'll always be under Will.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.334
You finally have a chance to get
out from under him, take it.

29:06.370 --> 29:07.871
Managing partnership is not

29:07.910 --> 29:09.935
under_ him.
It is.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.346
Why do you think he's
offering it to you?

29:12.380 --> 29:14.018
He wants_ someone
he can influece.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.347
Someone that he knows.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.369
Okay, thanks, Cary.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.344
Alicia, this is your chance.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.381
Take it.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.388
After much consideration--

29:24.430 --> 29:26.489
actually, 30 minutes
of consideration--

29:26.530 --> 29:29.124
I have concluded that control of
one's body is an absolute.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.027
This principle is enshrined

29:32.070 --> 29:34.459
in our Constitution
and jurisprudence.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.435
Parties may not contract
around it.

29:37.470 --> 29:40.234
A provision empowering
the Isenstadts

29:40.270 --> 29:44.400
to compel an abortion is
an affront to public policy.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.374
The application for
specific performance is denied.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.173
(gavelbangs)
Your Honor, my client

29:49.220 --> 29:50.517
moves _for a
declaratory judgment

29:50.550 --> 29:52.484
that the contract
has been breached.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.011
ALICIA:
Excuse me, Your Honor.

29:55.060 --> 29:58.518
By denying petitioners' motion
for specific performance...
The court has ruled only

29:58.560 --> 30:01.393
that the provision related
to abortion is unenforceable.

30:01.430 --> 30:04.399
Plaintiffs allege a number
of other contractual breaches.
DAVID: What a load

30:04.430 --> 30:07.092
of bunk. They're trying
to extort this lovely
young mother-to-be

30:07.130 --> 30:08.563
into an abortion.
Uh,uh".

30:08.600 --> 30:11.398
(Schmidt and David arguing)

30:11.440 --> 30:12.862
Gentlemen!
(arguing stops)

30:12.910 --> 30:14.468
No!

30:14.510 --> 30:16.501
Mr. Schmidt, what breaches

30:16.540 --> 30:18.041
are you
referring to?

30:18.080 --> 30:20.548
The defendant failed
to live up to various...

30:20.580 --> 30:22.070
performance sections
of the contract.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.338
Oh, come on. Your Honor,
if Mr. Schmidt's clients

30:24.390 --> 30:25.846
wish to bring
a separate suit...

30:25.890 --> 30:28.085
No, no. No need. In the interest

30:28.120 --> 30:30.554
of judicial economy, I will

30:30.590 --> 30:33.889
hear the motion for
declaratory judgment.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.249
(gavelbangs)

30:35.300 --> 30:38.098
They lost, right?
What are they doing now?

30:38.130 --> 30:42.829
DAVID:
Scorching the earth
and poisoning the wells.

30:47.110 --> 30:49.032
(knocking)

30:51.110 --> 30:53.943
Hi, I'm, uh... I'm Cam.

30:53.980 --> 30:57.017
Is Grace here?

30:57.050 --> 30:59.211
She...

30:59.250 --> 31:01.184
Uh, I'm sorry, you're...?

31:01.220 --> 31:03.552
Cam.

31:03.590 --> 31:04.625
You must be Mrs. Florrick.

31:04.660 --> 31:08.118
Uh, I-I told Grace I might
swing by after dinner.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.424
I'm, uh... I'm running
a little late.
She's out.

31:10.460 --> 31:14.430
Um, but maybe you'd like
to come in and have a beer.

31:14.470 --> 31:15.539
Yeah, that'd be great.

31:15.570 --> 31:17.595
Thanks.
Are you insane?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.369
My daughter is
16 years old.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.072
You do not come knocking
at her door again.

31:22.110 --> 31:23.509
Do you understand,
Cam?

31:23.540 --> 31:25.144
Now is the time to say "yes."

31:25.180 --> 31:26.374
Yes.

31:26.410 --> 31:27.968
Good!

31:28.020 --> 31:30.113
Express elevator
is right behind you.

31:30.150 --> 31:31.344
Turn around.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.227
(sighs)

31:40.530 --> 31:43.351
ROBYN:
Why does David Lee
not trust you?

31:43.400 --> 31:46.528
He thinks I'm doing
what you're doing.

31:46.570 --> 31:48.060
What am I doing?

31:48.100 --> 31:49.397
Leaving with Cary

31:49.440 --> 31:51.067
and the other
fourth years.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.931
Oh. Well...
(chuckles)

31:53.980 --> 31:55.936
All right, I need help.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.948
I think this doctor
on the surrogacy case

31:57.980 --> 32:00.005
has a drinking problem,
but I need someone

32:00.050 --> 32:02.678
at the SA's office to
confirm rumors of a DUI.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.178
Do you have
suggestions?
Yes.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.051
Can you tell me them?

32:08.090 --> 32:09.114
No.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.184
Why not?

32:10.220 --> 32:11.721
Robyn, you're leaving.
Yeah.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.182
Well, so is Alicia,
but you help her.

32:16.260 --> 32:20.264
So is Alicia, but you helped
her on the death penalty case.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.733
Alicia's leaving?

32:21.770 --> 32:24.136
Yeah, I thought you knew.

32:26.610 --> 32:28.134
What...

32:31.410 --> 32:33.173
She didn't say anything.

32:33.210 --> 32:34.177
Yeah.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.040
It's supposed to be a secret.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.513
(chuckles)

32:38.550 --> 32:41.155
Check with the clinic's
medical rep.

32:41.190 --> 32:43.454
They usually know
all the doctor's problems.

32:43.490 --> 32:46.323
Thank you.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.595
PETER:
So, Eli tells me

32:50.630 --> 32:53.599
you have a-a concern over
my choice for the water board.

32:53.630 --> 32:56.428
I do. The problem is, sir,
one of appearances.

32:56.470 --> 32:57.767
Appearances. Uh-huh.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.131
So who would you choose?

32:59.170 --> 33:00.603
The current water board head.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.709
Gra bowski?

33:01.740 --> 33:03.401
He's an idiot.
(chuckles)

33:03.440 --> 33:05.078
Well, I can't speak
to that, sir.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.441
Continuity, of course,
is to be valued.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.074
And there would be no hint
of a conflict of interest.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.473
Yes. So what you're saying

33:10.520 --> 33:12.488
is that you would hire
someone second-rate

33:12.520 --> 33:13.748
because they're more ethical?

33:13.790 --> 33:14.814
No, I'm just saying

33:14.860 --> 33:17.488
that a conflict of interest
is a matter of law,

33:17.520 --> 33:19.124
_ and second-rate
is a matter of opinion.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.354
Hmm.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.392
Who do you like better,
Hemingway or Dan Brown?

33:22.430 --> 33:25.024
I'm not a good judge
of literature, sir.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.626
Uh, who's Dan Brown?

33:27.670 --> 33:29.069
Da Vinci Code.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.260
Ah.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.403
Oh, okay.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.702
Well, I haven't read it;
I-I've seen it.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.503
And I really like Tom Hanks.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.134
Who doesn't?

33:39.110 --> 33:42.113
Um, well, I don't think I can
take your advice, Marilyn.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.789
And I really do appreciate
it, but I just...

33:44.820 --> 33:47.243
can't choose Dan Brown
over Hemingway.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.417
Well, thank you
for listening to me, sir.

33:49.460 --> 33:50.813
Sure.

33:50.860 --> 33:54.091
And I'll make sure
I take a look at Da Vinci Code.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.155
(laughing):
Oh, don't do it
on my account.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.451
No.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.297
I spent too many years
in law school

33:59.330 --> 34:01.298
with my eyes glued
to LexisNexis.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.503
I should... uh, probably
broaden my horizons.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.518
Yes, I read the contract.

34:15.550 --> 34:18.713
Could you please read
the highlighted provision?

34:18.750 --> 34:20.479
"During the course
of the pregnancy,

34:20.520 --> 34:21.384
"the surrogate agrees

34:21.420 --> 34:23.411
"not to engage in
any sexual activity

34:23.460 --> 34:26.122
that would constitute
a risk to the fetus."

34:26.160 --> 34:27.559
SCHMIDT:
How many sexual partners

34:27.590 --> 34:29.353
have you had since
your pregnancy?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.753
Four, I guess.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.199
But they always
used a condom.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.424
SCHMIDT:
And did you and any

34:33.470 --> 34:34.835
of these upstanding gentlemen

34:34.870 --> 34:36.531
ever engage in a threesome?

34:36.570 --> 34:37.594
ALICIA:
Objection, Your Honor.

34:37.640 --> 34:38.732
This is character assassination.

34:38.770 --> 34:40.203
SCHMIDT:
An orgy is a

34:40.240 --> 34:42.572
per se violation
of her contractual commitment

34:42.610 --> 34:43.838
not to engage
in rislq

34:43.880 --> 34:45.677
sexual behavior.
Overruled.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.541
Ms. Bach, you
may answer.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.219
No, I never engaged
in a threesome.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.786
MAN:
It was her idea.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.583
SCHMIDT:
The threesome was?

34:53.620 --> 34:55.884
Yes. Um, we were
in this bar

34:55.920 --> 34:57.456
called
Chesterfield's,

34:57.490 --> 34:59.629
and she saw this
guy With tattoos--

34:59.660 --> 35:02.322
Evan-- and Tara
said that we should

35:02.360 --> 35:03.657
bring him back
to her place.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.497
And did you?
Yes.

35:05.530 --> 35:07.122
Okay, that's a lie.
You're a liar.

35:07.170 --> 35:08.569
I haven't seen you in a year.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.498
JUDGE:
Mrs. Florrick,

35:09.540 --> 35:11.531
if your client can't
restrain herself...

35:11.570 --> 35:14.573
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.547
And what happened
after you brought Evan back?

35:18.580 --> 35:19.706
Well, we double...

35:23.280 --> 35:24.645
I mean, we had a threesome.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.544
SCHMIDT:
And did anyone
use protection?

35:26.590 --> 35:28.512
MAN:
Uh, no. None of us.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.585
DAVID:
It doesn't matter
if he was lying.

35:30.620 --> 35:31.757
The judge believed him.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.280
So, what do we...

35:33.330 --> 35:34.422
(clamoring)

35:34.460 --> 35:36.428
What is going on?

35:36.460 --> 35:37.324
Hello.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.261
Mr. Florrick, it is
so good to meet you.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.461
I'm David Lee, one of
your earlier fans.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.592
Alicia and I
work together.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.232
Oh, hello, Mr. Lee.
How are you?

35:45.270 --> 35:46.430
Good, good.

35:46.470 --> 35:47.539
You have quite
a wife here.

35:47.570 --> 35:48.639
(chuckles)

35:48.680 --> 35:49.874
What's up, Peter?

35:49.910 --> 35:51.502
Nothing. I, uh...
I had a break.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.539
I thought I'd
come say hello.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.241
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.713
A little difficult
with the security detail.

35:55.750 --> 35:57.615
It's_ still a
surprise to us.

35:57.650 --> 35:58.742
Yeah.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.644
Um, okay, excuse me.

36:00.690 --> 36:03.250
(quietly):
Um, I booked a suite in Wailea.

36:03.290 --> 36:05.429
They have a package
for renewing your vows.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.751
Um, Peter, I thought you said...

36:08.800 --> 36:11.496
I mean, I thought we had to wait
until after the inauguration.

36:11.530 --> 36:13.498
I thought we did, too,
but it will be

36:13.530 --> 36:14.792
just as difficult
after the inauguration,

36:14.840 --> 36:16.592
so I think we should do it now.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.631
What's going on?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.569
Nothing's going on.

36:21.610 --> 36:22.929
I love you.

36:23.980 --> 36:25.607
I love you, too. I...

36:25.650 --> 36:26.901
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. Florrick.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.508
Alicia, the judge
wants us back in.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.211
(sighs)

36:30.250 --> 36:31.615
Your Honor,
30 minutes ago,

36:31.650 --> 36:33.538
Ms. Bach approached
my client and offered

36:33.590 --> 36:34.989
to abort the fetus
for $100,000.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.284
DAVID: _
Judge, that is a
preposterous lie.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.651
It constitutes
blackmail, Your Honor.

36:38.690 --> 36:39.588
Wait a minute.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.621
Yo_u've ruled _
that my client has the right

36:41.660 --> 36:43.491
to decide whether
to have an abortion.

36:43.530 --> 36:45.521
There's nothing illegal
about monetizing that right.

36:45.570 --> 36:48.289
So you're saying
that she made this offer?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.262
No, I'm saying,
if she did make this offer--

36:50.300 --> 36:51.858
and I have no knowledge
that she did--

36:51.910 --> 36:54.333
she was merely using money
as a carrot,

36:54.380 --> 36:55.836
just as the Isenstadts
used it as a stick.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.370
Judge, if tying

36:57.410 --> 36:58.707
the destruction of a fetus

36:58.750 --> 37:00.570
to the payment of money
isn't blackmail, nothing is.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.612
JUDGE:
Okay. I'll hear
from Ms. Bach

37:02.650 --> 37:03.947
on this question
first thing tomorrow.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.414
ALICIA:
Judge, even if she
were to make the offer,

37:06.450 --> 37:07.348
it was nothing more

37:07.390 --> 37:09.415
than a permissible
settlement negotiation

37:09.460 --> 37:10.882
in a civil_case.
Or a crime.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.820
If I find your client's
committed one,

37:12.860 --> 37:14.555
I'll refer her to the
state's attorney.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.963
Mom, did you tell Cam
to leave me alone?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.966
Good morning, Grace.

37:27.010 --> 37:28.602
Did you tell Cam
to get lost?

37:28.640 --> 37:31.029
_ You mean the man
With the motorcycle helmet,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.708
the man who came to my door,
who wanted to come in

37:33.750 --> 37:34.876
and have a beer
and wait for you?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.512
Mom, he's my pastor.

37:37.550 --> 37:40.280
He's the head
of Campus Faith.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.288
He was supposed to pick
up some reading plans.

37:43.320 --> 37:47.051
Okay... Grace,
he didn't look like a...

37:47.090 --> 37:48.751
I don't know what
he looked like,

37:48.800 --> 37:51.360
but just because
they're pastors

37:51.400 --> 37:53.891
doesn't mean anything.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.039
Mom, what's going on?

37:59.070 --> 38:01.800
I saw the Web site--
the ten hottest daughters.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.933
Zach showed you.
No, I forced him
to show me.

38:03.980 --> 38:07.040
Mom, that doesn't
mean anything.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.342
I'm not after all of that.

38:08.380 --> 38:10.473
I know, honey,
but boys are.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.385
So?
So...

38:12.420 --> 38:14.615
you're dressing
differently.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.514
You're taking dresses
from my closet.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.481
You said I could.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.023
I know, but, Grace,
I'm your mom, and this...

38:20.060 --> 38:24.497
Mom... I want
to be pretty.

38:27.770 --> 38:30.933
Just let me be pretty.

38:30.970 --> 38:34.428
Oh, honey,
you a pretty.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.471
No, you have
to say that.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.039
I want other people to
think that I'm pretty.

38:50.090 --> 38:52.786
Did you tell my clients
that you'd only have an abortion

38:52.830 --> 38:55.048
if they paid you $100,000?

38:55.100 --> 38:57.091
No, I did not.
If the court
would please instruct

38:57.130 --> 38:58.051
the witness
she's under oath...

38:58.100 --> 38:59.727
Objection, Your Honor.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.432
The witness has been sworn
and is fully aware of that.

39:03.470 --> 39:05.631
You are under oath,

39:05.670 --> 39:06.762
ma'am.
(gasps)

39:07.610 --> 39:08.531
RO BYN :
Psst.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.378
TARA:
I might have said
that $100,000...

39:11.410 --> 39:13.947
I was looking
into the possibility

39:13.980 --> 39:15.140
that Dr. Tuft has a DUI.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.647
Really?
Yeah.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.819
He doesn't, but I was checking
with his medical reps

39:18.850 --> 39:20.738
and I did find out
something else.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.429
SCHMIDT:
So, what do you have?

39:24.460 --> 39:27.452
DAVID:
As Dr. Tuft's notes show,
he cultured the embryo

39:27.490 --> 39:29.492
48 hours prior
to implantation.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.521
Meaning there's been
a miscalculation of fetal age.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.923
Let me see that.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.029
We're in the third trimester,
Mr. Schmidt,

39:35.070 --> 39:38.437
meaning the
fetus is viable.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.801
DAVID:
Which means you won't
be able to pressure

39:39.840 --> 39:41.831
our client
to terminate.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.442
Okay.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.646
You're selfish, Tara.

39:53.690 --> 39:56.682
It'd be one thing
if you said I'm adopting him,

39:56.720 --> 39:59.188
but you're walking away.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.495
Remember what you said, Kathy,
after the first sonogram?

40:02.530 --> 40:05.169
"Do everything you can
to protect my baby."

40:05.200 --> 40:06.827
(scoffs)
This isn't protecting.

40:06.870 --> 40:08.064
It's owning.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.499
I'm keeping him alive.

40:09.540 --> 40:12.134
That's the only way I
know how to protect him.

40:12.170 --> 40:14.536
Feel him
kicking, Kathy.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.798
Just feel him.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.171
No.

40:34.230 --> 40:36.824
DAVID:
It's the final offer, Diane.

40:36.860 --> 40:39.021
No, it's the final offer
when I accept it.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.733
No.

40:45.770 --> 40:48.534
Howard, David, could you
please give us a moment?

40:48.580 --> 40:49.535
HOWARD:
We got a problem?

40:49.580 --> 40:52.708
No, just something
between Diane and myself.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.848
Alicia, you stay.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.542
I'm going to want you to run
a change in the contract.

41:03.290 --> 41:05.485
What do you want?

41:05.530 --> 41:06.485
More than this.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.249
No, this isn't about money.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.756
This is about us.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.791
So, what do you want
from me?

41:16.600 --> 41:19.160
I put my life
into this place.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.137
My whole life.

41:21.170 --> 41:22.137
And it's appreciated.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.204
No, it's not--

41:23.240 --> 41:26.004
not with ghouls like that
shoving me out the door.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.745
Well, I can't negotiate
appreciation.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.042
That's right.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.117
That's why you'd better do it
with money.

41:38.260 --> 41:42.128
And how much appreciation are
you looking for, Your Honor?

41:47.930 --> 41:50.694
I must have really hurt you...

41:50.740 --> 41:52.560
to make you want
to hurt me like this.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.272
That was the deal from the
beginning, Diane, remember?

41:56.710 --> 41:59.008
We work together until it's
not fun or profitable

41:59.050 --> 42:00.574
anymore.

42:00.610 --> 42:02.248
Well, here we are.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.589
Are you having fun?

42:08.960 --> 42:12.259
Bump the package up
by 20% and I'll leave.

42:12.290 --> 42:13.621
I can't do that.

42:13.660 --> 42:14.729
Then find another way.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.751
I'll be at home.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.808
(sighs)

42:25.840 --> 42:26.909
She'll come around.

42:26.940 --> 42:29.306
She knows

42:29.340 --> 42:31.171
_she can't be sworn in
With a partnership dispute

42:31.210 --> 42:32.302
hanging over her head.

42:46.790 --> 42:48.792
We need to leave this week.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.168
You're sure?

42:54.200 --> 42:54.268
Yes.
