WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:05.256
(all shouting)

00:06.089 --> 00:06.806
Wait.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.099
BOTH: Grunkle Stan!

00:08.383 --> 00:11.603
Kids!
I can't believe it!

00:11.803 --> 00:13.476
I thought I lost you two.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.432
- Ahh!
- Mr. Pines, it's really you!

00:15.641 --> 00:18.190
I've been hugging strangers
to practice for this moment.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.066
We missed you,
you old codger.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.693
(chuckles)
I've missed you knuckleheads too.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.070
It's good to have you back.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.907
So...what's everyone
doing here?

00:27.110 --> 00:29.488
-(gasps)
- Yeah, there's, like, monsters and gnomes.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.869
And is Pacifica
wearing a potato sack?

00:32.073 --> 00:34.497
Hey! Even in a sack
I still look better than you.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.795
It's...
It's a long story.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.838
Hey, is anyone
gonna feed me?

00:39.039 --> 00:42.088
Larry King's disembodied
wax head wants num-nums.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.761
We're trying to ration
our food, remember?

00:44.962 --> 00:48.341
- Mmm...mmm...
- Uhh, it's happening again!

00:48.549 --> 00:50.802
MAN: Hey, everyone!

00:51.009 --> 00:52.807
Eve bat!

00:53.845 --> 00:55.813
(all gasp)
Evasive maneuvers!

00:56.014 --> 00:58.642
- Shh! Keep it down!
- GNOME: Get the lights!

01:01.061 --> 01:02.563
(raccoon chittering)

01:06.775 --> 01:09.449
I ♪

01:47.441 --> 01:50.240
Welcome to what's left
of normal around here--

01:51.528 --> 01:52.825

01:53.030 --> 01:54.532

01:54.740 --> 01:57.789
We have...

01:57.993 --> 02:00.041

02:01.371 --> 02:02.623
Rumble McSkirmish?

02:02.831 --> 02:03.923
(electronic voice)
Do not be afraid.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.341
Weirdmaggedon
has taught me

02:05.542 --> 02:07.135
there are some battles
I cannot win.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.884
I am now Humble McSkirmish.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.386
Grunkle Stan,
how'd this all happen?

02:12.549 --> 02:14.176
So I was hammering
signs out back

02:14.384 --> 02:16.512
when the sky started
vomiting nightmares.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.222
I listen to
a lot of AM radio,

02:18.430 --> 02:20.774
so I knew what this meant--
the end of the world.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.442
(cackling)

02:22.643 --> 02:24.520
<i>What I didn't expect
was what happened next.</i>

02:27.105 --> 02:28.732
(roars)

02:33.362 --> 02:35.831
<i>Turns out whatever you and
my brother did to the Shack</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:37.533
<i>with your unicorn voodoo</i>

02:37.741 --> 02:39.994
<i>made the crazy place
invincible to weirdness.</i>

02:43.955 --> 02:46.003
Of course--
the unicorn spell!

02:46.208 --> 02:49.508
That's why this is the only place
Bill's magic can't touch.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.805
That's when Possum Breath
over here shows up

02:52.839 --> 02:54.091
leading a bunch of injured
stragglers through the forest.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.600
They needed a place to stay,

02:55.801 --> 02:57.348
and since
the Mayor got captured,

02:57.552 --> 02:59.805
I elected myself
de facto chief.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.017
The plan's to stay in here and eat
brown meat until we run out.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.943
Then I vote
we eat the gnomes.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.861
Hey, I'm short,
not deaf!

03:07.062 --> 03:09.315
Shh! Shh! Stress will
make you chewy.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.402
Grunkle Stan, we can't all
just hide inside the Shack.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.194
There's a town
in need of saving!

03:14.403 --> 03:17.657
Me and Ford tried to do it,
but he got captured by Bill.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.990
Serves that jerk right!

03:19.199 --> 03:21.247
My brother's had
some stupid plans,

03:21.451 --> 03:24.876
but going up against an all-powerful
space demon was his worst one yet.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.833
Trust me, we have everything
we need right here.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.170
It's not the Ritz, but at least the
monsters inside know how to massage.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.382
You know Shiatsu?
Yes, I've taken some classes.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.842
So, you're really
just gonna let Bill win?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.848
Look, kiddo.
We got a good deal here.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.976
Besides, I'm sure wherever
the rest of the townsfolk are,

03:42.180 --> 03:43.272
they're fine.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.770
(broadcast news alert)

03:44.975 --> 03:46.318
This is Shandra Jimenez

03:46.518 --> 03:47.986
reporting live from
the inside of Bill's castle.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.563
Here for the first time

03:49.771 --> 03:51.865
are images of what's happened
to the captured townsfolk.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.282
Viewers are advised
to look away

03:53.483 --> 03:54.951
if they don't want to see
their friends

03:55.152 --> 03:57.655
turned into a twisted throne
of human agony.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.116
- Mom and Dad?
- My family!

04:00.323 --> 04:01.825
Deputy Durland!

04:02.868 --> 04:04.085
Is there no one who will
save the people of this town?

04:04.244 --> 04:08.294
I'm Shandra Jimenez, and I'm being
turned into stone by a flying eyeball.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.798
(all gasp)

04:13.003 --> 04:14.926
Oh, no.
My parents are bad,

04:15.130 --> 04:18.053
but even they don't
deserve to be turned to stone.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.930
Curse you, Bill!

04:20.135 --> 04:22.388
Why must you take
everything we love?

04:22.554 --> 04:24.181
(wails)

04:24.389 --> 04:27.188
Guys, don't you see?
Our friends need us,

04:27.392 --> 04:29.815
but we only save them
if we fight back!

04:30.020 --> 04:32.944
Mabel is right.
Bill wants us to run and hide.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.991
He wants us to think
he's invincible.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.865
But Ford told me
before he was captured

04:37.068 --> 04:39.491
that he knows
Bill's secret weakness.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.289
(all murmuring)

04:41.490 --> 04:42.491
Weakness?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.827
Now, if we band together,

04:45.035 --> 04:46.787
if we combine
all of our strength,

04:46.995 --> 04:48.292
our smarts,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.545
our...whatever Toby has...

04:50.749 --> 04:52.592
<i>Aureus</i> rashes!

04:52.751 --> 04:54.799
...then we just might be
able to rescue Ford,

04:55.003 --> 04:56.129
learn Bill's weakness,

04:56.338 --> 04:58.181
and save Gravity Falls!

04:58.381 --> 05:01.476
(all cheering)

05:01.676 --> 05:02.973
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

05:03.178 --> 05:04.976
Have you all forgotten
who's in charge here?

05:05.180 --> 05:07.057
Besides,
we're only safe inside!

05:07.265 --> 05:09.643
It's not like we can take
the Mystery Shack to Bill.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.444
McGUCKET: Wha-- Whoa!

05:11.645 --> 05:14.273
Holy hootenanny!
Flapjack and fiddlebanjos!

05:14.481 --> 05:16.108
Sorry. Sorry.
Got a little excited.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.777
What I meant to say is,

05:18.985 --> 05:21.864
I think I figured out a way
to fight Bill and rescue Ford.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.291
But we're all gonna
have to work together!

05:24.491 --> 05:26.710
Now...

05:26.910 --> 05:27.957
if you just...

05:28.161 --> 05:30.038
(low chatter)

05:30.247 --> 05:32.921
SOOS: Don't worry, Ford.
We're coming for you!

05:36.962 --> 05:39.932
Let me go!
You insane three-sided--

05:40.131 --> 05:41.974
Wha-- What is this place?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.177
(chain clanking)

05:44.386 --> 05:46.605
<i>BILL:

05:46.805 --> 05:49.809

05:50.016 --> 05:55.022
<i>♪ Oh, I know we'll meet again

Wh-- Where am I?

05:56.565 --> 05:58.238
<i>You're in
the penthouse suite, kid!</i>

05:58.441 --> 06:00.694
<i>The tip of the pyramid!
Have a drink.</i>

06:00.902 --> 06:03.075
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

06:03.280 --> 06:06.875
<i>You know that couch is made
from living human skin?</i>

06:07.075 --> 06:07.826
(groans)

06:08.034 --> 06:09.035
Aah!

06:09.244 --> 06:10.791
Quit the games, Cipher!

06:10.954 --> 06:13.332
If I'm still alive, you must want
something from me.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.918
<i>Ah, sharp as ever,
Fordsy.</i>

06:16.084 --> 06:17.256
<i>As you may have noticed...</i>

06:17.460 --> 06:20.088
<i>I've recently had a
multi-dimensional makeover!</i>

06:20.297 --> 06:22.299
<i>I control space and matter,</i>

06:22.507 --> 06:24.509
<i>and now that that dumb
baby's out of the way,</i>

06:24.718 --> 06:25.810
<i>time itself!</i>

06:26.011 --> 06:28.639
<i>- But I wasn't always this way.</i>
- Oof!

06:28.847 --> 06:30.474
<i>You think those
chains are tight?</i>

06:30.682 --> 06:32.901
<i>Imagine living in
the second dimension--</i>

06:33.101 --> 06:35.820
<i>flat minds in a flat world
with flat dreams.</i>

06:36.855 --> 06:39.278
<i>I liberated my dimension, Stanford,
and I'm here to liberate yours.</i>

06:39.482 --> 06:42.110
<i>There's just one hitch.
As it turns out,</i>

06:42.319 --> 06:45.869
<i>my weirdness can't escape
the magical confines of this town!</i>

06:46.072 --> 06:48.291
<i>There's something
keeping me in.</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:52.667
Incredible! Gravity Falls' Natural Law
of Weirdness Magnetism.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.339
I studied this years ago!

06:54.539 --> 06:56.837
<i>- And did you find a way to undo it?
- Of</i> course!

06:57.042 --> 06:59.340
There's a simple equation that
could collapse the barrier.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.966
But I'd never tell you!

07:01.171 --> 07:03.799
<i>Listen, Ford, if you just
tell me that equation,</i>

07:04.007 --> 07:06.681
<i>finally your dimension
will be free!</i>

07:08.678 --> 07:10.271
<i>Anything will be possible!</i>

07:13.058 --> 07:15.777
(all screaming)

07:15.936 --> 07:19.782
<i>I'll remake a fun world-
a better world!</i>

07:19.981 --> 07:23.576
<i>A party that never ends
with a host that never dies!</i>

07:23.777 --> 07:25.120
<i>No more restrictions!</i>

07:25.320 --> 07:26.822
<i>No more laws!</i>

07:27.030 --> 07:28.156
<i>You'd be one of us.</i>

07:28.365 --> 07:29.582
<i>All-powerful!</i>

07:29.783 --> 07:31.911
<i>Greater than anything
you've imagined!</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.212
<i>And all I need is your help.</i>

07:34.412 --> 07:36.210
You're insane
if you think I'll help you.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.042
<i>Ha ha ha! I'm insane
either way, brainiac!</i>

07:39.250 --> 07:40.547
<i>But have it your way.</i>

07:40.752 --> 07:42.846
<i>I'll just fish around
and get that equation</i>

07:43.046 --> 07:44.764
<i>directly out of your mind!</i>

07:44.965 --> 07:46.217
Not so fast!

07:46.424 --> 07:47.892
You know the rules, Bill.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.016
You may be able
to haunt my dreams,

07:51.221 --> 07:52.643
but you can't enter my mind

07:52.847 --> 07:55.566
unless I shake your hand
and let you in.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.859
<i>(sighs)
You're making this</i>

07:57.060 --> 07:59.813
<i>so much harder
than it needs to be.</i>

08:00.021 --> 08:01.898
<i>Everyone has a weakness,
tough guy!</i>

08:02.107 --> 08:03.484
<i>I'll make you talk!</i>

08:03.692 --> 08:06.286
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

08:06.486 --> 08:08.329
Aaaah!

08:12.534 --> 08:16.505
All right. I've made some
thingamadiculous robomajigs in my day,

08:16.705 --> 08:19.254
but this is the first one
that won't be used for evil!

08:19.457 --> 08:21.835
Whoa! These blueprints
are incredible, McGucket.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.466
MABEL: This is your most
amazing invention yet.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.799
Question: Does it have
any gun-swords?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.384
I watch a lot
of anime and, uh,

08:28.591 --> 08:30.889
trust me, you're gonna
want some gun-swords.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.812
What's an "anime"?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.724
- We have much to discuss.
- STAN: Discuss, nothing!

08:36.140 --> 08:38.894
These scribbles are a bunch
of cockamamie balderdash!

08:39.102 --> 08:40.318
Excuse my French.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.113
<i>(voice speaking French)</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:45.192
And where would you even find a
bunch of idiots crazy enough to build it?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.199
Grunkle Stan,
you're lookin' at those idiots.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.700
(all cheering)

08:49.904 --> 08:50.905
Idiots!

08:56.995 --> 09:00.090
(action movie-style
music plays)

09:00.290 --> 09:01.917
Whoa--What--
What are you--

09:02.125 --> 09:04.378
Hey-- Hey, now.
Hey! Don't touch that.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.678
<i>Hey“
Rah'!</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:12.010
Uhh! Uhh!

09:13.303 --> 09:14.850
Aaah!

09:21.519 --> 09:25.023
("Action" music continues)

09:37.035 --> 09:38.958
Thanks for these
apocalypse sweaters, Mabel.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.789
The end of the world
has never been so comfortable.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.377
ALL: Mm-hmm!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.801
(wind whistling)

09:45.835 --> 09:46.757
Uhh! Fine,
I'll wear it.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.305
But I'm <i>not</i> gonna
like it.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.975
Admit it. This is the best day
of the end of the world.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.973
I think we actually have
a chance to beat Bill

09:54.177 --> 09:55.520
and win back our future.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.518
Yeah. Getting
to actually <i>live</i>

09:57.722 --> 09:58.894
to see our
13th birthday party

09:59.099 --> 10:01.818
is the only birthday present
I want right now.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.486
Hey, if we're
lucky enough to get there,

10:03.686 --> 10:05.814
I guarantee this whole town
is gonna throw you

10:06.856 --> 10:07.903
the best birthday party
you've ever seen.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.576
Thanks, Soos.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.949
Hey, has anyone
seen Grunkle Stan?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.575
This whole plan is bonkers.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.953
But of course, no one asked
the Chief what he thinks.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.875
After all I've done
for everyone!

10:18.076 --> 10:19.828
Schmebulock.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.713
Yeah, exactly-- it's a total load
of schmebulock.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.712
Is something wrong,
Grunkle Stan?

10:24.916 --> 10:27.544
You're acting
grunklier than usual.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.754
It's this darn plan
to save my brother.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.762
If you didn't notice, I already
saved him once from that portal,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.138
and he never thanked me!

10:34.342 --> 10:35.935
He causes
the end of the world,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.308
and somehow it's still always

10:37.512 --> 10:39.935
"Stan's the screw-up,
Ford's the hero."

10:40.140 --> 10:41.938
Well, maybe people
think he's a hero

10:42.142 --> 10:44.361
because he didn't want
to hide in the Mystery Shack!

10:44.561 --> 10:47.815
Well, maybe if he hid in the Mystery
Shack he wouldn't have been captured!

10:48.857 --> 10:51.280
Guys! Guys! Trust me,
tomorrow's gonna be great!

10:51.484 --> 10:53.782
I believe in us.
COW MONSTER: Help! Leader Mabel!

10:53.987 --> 10:56.831
I keep accidentally flexing
through my sweater!

10:57.866 --> 10:58.913
Aah! It happened again!

10:59.117 --> 11:01.791
Those weird cow-monsters
are delightful!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.542
Coming!

11:07.000 --> 11:07.842
(bleats)

11:08.042 --> 11:10.261
McGUCKET:
All right, fellas!

11:10.461 --> 11:13.681
Let's hope this turns out
better than my other inventions!

11:13.882 --> 11:15.008
Everybody ready?

11:15.216 --> 11:16.513
Dipper, now!

11:19.929 --> 11:21.931
(machinery rattling)

11:27.187 --> 11:29.736
ALL:
Huh?! Whoa!

11:30.815 --> 11:32.158
(steam whistle blowing)

11:37.697 --> 11:40.450
Forgive me, boy. Your
hyper-flammable merchandise

11:40.658 --> 11:42.535
is the only
thing keeping me goin'.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.877
What in blazes?!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.589
FORD:
No! No! Nooo!

11:50.793 --> 11:51.794
(all cackling)

11:52.003 --> 11:52.845
(groaning)

11:53.046 --> 11:54.969
<i>Ready to talk now?</i>

11:55.173 --> 11:56.971
(gasping)
I won't.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.269
I won't let you
into my mind!

11:59.469 --> 12:02.894
<i>What do you think, pals?
Another 500 volts?</i>

12:03.097 --> 12:03.939
(crackling)
<i>Hey, do you hear that?</i>

12:04.140 --> 12:05.687
(crashing)

12:05.892 --> 12:08.020
(roaring)

12:09.979 --> 12:12.357
<i>What?! I just fixed that door!</i>

12:17.028 --> 12:18.405
(roaring)

12:22.408 --> 12:25.582
It's the Shacktron, dude!

12:25.787 --> 12:27.960
LARRY KING: They made the house
into a robot.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.165
Fascinating!

12:29.374 --> 12:31.843
<i>So the mortals are
trying to fight back, huh?</i>

12:32.001 --> 12:33.674
<i>Adorable!</i>

12:33.878 --> 12:35.926
<i>Henchmaniacs,
you know what to do!</i>

12:37.632 --> 12:39.100
<i>Take them out!</i>

12:48.643 --> 12:50.486
This was a bad idea.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.364
<i>P.A.: Uh, hey, dudes.
Is this thing on?</i>

12:56.567 --> 12:57.944
- SOOS: <i>T es--

12:58.152 --> 13:00.575
<i>Heh. Uh, I just wanted
you monster dudes</i>

13:00.780 --> 13:03.829
<i>to hand over Ford, or we'll
have to, like, fight and junk?</i>

13:04.033 --> 13:06.161
<i>Heh heh. Hey,
you're a little cutie.</i>

13:06.369 --> 13:09.794
I have butchered millions
on countless moons!

13:09.998 --> 13:12.171
<i>Whoa. I liked you better
before you talked.</i>

13:12.375 --> 13:14.173
<i>Real-- real bring-down,
this guy.</i>

13:14.377 --> 13:15.970
Attack!

13:16.170 --> 13:18.172
All right, dudes!

13:18.381 --> 13:20.099
Everyone!
Like we planned!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.598
Three, two, one. Go!

13:24.846 --> 13:26.473
(all shouting)

13:32.061 --> 13:34.780
(henchmaniacs shouting)

13:34.981 --> 13:37.029
Ha ha ha!
Good pig.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.118
Get 'em, Gobblewonker!

13:42.322 --> 13:43.198
(McGucket laughs)

13:43.406 --> 13:45.829
Hvah! Hyah!

13:46.034 --> 13:48.002

Oh. Oh, no.

<i>Aah! My eye!</i>

15:14.956 --> 15:16.128

15:16.332 --> 15:18.084
<i>how long it takes

15:18.292 --> 15:20.090
We've got him distracted!
Now's our chance!

15:20.294 --> 15:22.547
Rescue team,
move out!

15:31.013 --> 15:31.855
OK, everyone!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.353
We get in,
rescue Ford,

15:33.558 --> 15:34.684
get out,
save the world.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.768
Piece of cake.

15:35.977 --> 15:36.773
Just so we're clear,

15:36.978 --> 15:38.605
if I die,
I'm suing all of you.

15:38.813 --> 15:39.905
Hey, on second thought,

15:40.106 --> 15:41.483
maybe we could
come up with a plan

15:41.691 --> 15:43.785
that doesn't involve us plummeting
to our certain death.

15:43.985 --> 15:44.861
Ahh!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.197

16:15.266 --> 16:17.769
DIPPER:
Oh, man. It looks even worse up close.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.193
MABEL:
I found Great-uncle Ford!

16:25.401 --> 16:28.780
He's golden!
But not in the good way!

16:28.988 --> 16:31.616
STAN: Great. Grab him
and let's get out of here.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.246
But how are we going
to unfreeze them?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.249
GIDEON:
I know!

16:35.453 --> 16:36.329
(Gideon panting)

16:39.415 --> 16:41.793
Gideon!
What happened to you?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.844
Bill captured me.
He's been forcing me

16:44.045 --> 16:47.174
to do cute dances in this cage
for all eternity.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.260
(sobbing)
I'm so tired of being cute!

16:50.468 --> 16:51.811
How do we undo this?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.764
GIDEON: Mayor Tyler.
He's the load-bearing human.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.770
Pull him out,
and the whole thing goes down.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.227
(grunting)

17:02.813 --> 17:04.030
Aaah!

17:05.398 --> 17:08.528
Ah. My mouth tastes
like nightmares!

17:08.736 --> 17:12.832
Aah! I think I'm dark and
tortured for <i>reals</i> now.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.789
This experience will
forever scar Tad Strange.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.165
No more sailor suits!

17:18.371 --> 17:19.748
(panting)

17:19.955 --> 17:22.253

17:22.458 --> 17:23.835
Mom! Dad!

17:24.042 --> 17:25.761
Du rland!

17:28.297 --> 17:29.344
My Blubs!

17:29.549 --> 17:32.849
Don't you ever scare me
like that again!

17:33.052 --> 17:35.350
(all cheering)

17:38.015 --> 17:39.642
Kids! Ah, you did it!

17:39.850 --> 17:41.944
I knew I could
count on you two. Ha ha!

17:43.020 --> 17:44.317
Fiddldeford! I--

17:44.522 --> 17:46.445
I haven't seen you
since we parted ways.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.242
You must hate me.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.446
I've tried forgettin'.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.656
Maybe I should
try <i>forgiving.</i>

17:53.864 --> 17:55.912
Come here, old friend.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.916
Hey, good to see you too, bro.
Now let's get out of here, huh?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.589
Listen, Uncle Ford,
we don't have a lot of time.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.632
Remember how you told me
right before you were frozen

18:03.833 --> 18:05.335
that you knew Bill's weakness?

18:05.501 --> 18:07.754
Yeah, a secret way
to defeat him?

18:07.962 --> 18:09.009
1-- I do!

18:09.213 --> 18:12.012
Now, does anyone have a pen?
Pencil? Anything?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.217
Ah.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.679
Perfect!

18:17.805 --> 18:19.398
Uh, we've got Bill outside,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.943
but I don't know how long
we can keep him occupied.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.520
Yes, yes. Good, good.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.025
Drawing a circle
on the floor.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.651
Well,
he's lost his mind.

18:26.856 --> 18:27.982
My mind is fine.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.113
And there is a way to beat him--
with this!

18:32.737 --> 18:35.115
The world's most confusing
game of hopscotch?

18:35.323 --> 18:36.870
No, a prophecy.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.668
Although it would be
a pretty fun game of hopscotch.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.873
FORD: <i>Many years ago,
I found ten symbols in a cave.</i>

18:43.080 --> 18:46.505
<i>Some I recognized then.
Some I only recognize now.</i>

18:46.751 --> 18:48.298
<i>The native people
of Gravity Falls</i>

18:48.502 --> 18:49.719
<i>prophesized that
these symbols</i>

18:49.920 --> 18:51.297
<i>could create a force
strong enough</i>

18:51.505 --> 18:52.757
<i>to vanquish Bill.</i>

18:52.965 --> 18:54.091
<i>With Bill defeated,</i>

18:54.300 --> 18:57.224
<i>his weirdness would be reversed
and the town could be saved.</i>

18:57.428 --> 18:59.806
This whole time I thought
it was just superstition.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.436
But seeing you all here now

19:01.641 --> 19:03.518
I finally understand
that it's destiny!

19:03.726 --> 19:06.400
Dipper, the pine tree.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.698
Mabel, the shooting star.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.525
The question mark.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.610
This one's unsolvable.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.616
That one's easy.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.448
You've been rockin' that dumb
hoodie since the seventh grade.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.001
Whoa. Destiny hoodie!

19:20.201 --> 19:21.669
The tent of telepathy sign!

19:21.869 --> 19:22.836
That must be Gideon.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.290
Whoo! An excuse to stand
next to Mabel!

19:25.498 --> 19:27.717
Don't turn this
into a big deal.

19:27.917 --> 19:28.839
Oh, I won't.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.795
(whispers)
I <i>will.</i>

19:31.003 --> 19:33.005
(Bill grunting)

19:35.341 --> 19:37.059
BILL: What the--

19:38.427 --> 19:40.805
<i>Hey, Achilles!</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:43.812
<i>Nice work with the heel!</i>

19:44.016 --> 19:44.858
(all gasp)

19:45.059 --> 19:46.311
<i>Fore!</i>

19:50.523 --> 19:51.615
Hold hands, everyone!

19:51.816 --> 19:53.910
This is a mystical
human energy circuit.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.987
Ice? Who's Ice?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.243
They symbol's needn't
all be literal, Dipper.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.870
It just has to be someone cool
in the face of danger.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.918
ALL CHANTING:
Wendy! Wendy!

20:03.119 --> 20:05.713
(giggles)
Shut up! you guys_

20:05.913 --> 20:09.668
Much like the spectacles
need to be someone scholarly.

20:09.834 --> 20:10.881
Heh heh!

20:11.085 --> 20:12.803
This is freaky.

20:13.838 --> 20:14.680
FORD:
Now hold hands, everyone.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.848
Ew! I'm not touching that.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.471
Do it, sweetie.
do the one thing

20:18.676 --> 20:20.394
no one in our family
has ever done--

20:20.594 --> 20:22.767
touch the hillbilly.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.689
(all gasp)

20:33.357 --> 20:35.200
Great-uncle Ford,
I think it's working!

20:35.401 --> 20:37.904
(McGucket cackling)
Yes, this is it!

20:38.112 --> 20:40.080
The rest of you get out!
It's too dangerous!

20:41.991 --> 20:43.959
We just need
one more person...

20:45.953 --> 20:47.796
Stanley! Stanley,
get over here!

20:47.997 --> 20:49.419
You're the only one left.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.296
You realize this is
a bunch of hogwash, right?

20:51.459 --> 20:53.302
You really think
some caveman graffiti

20:53.502 --> 20:54.674
is gonna stop that monster?

20:54.879 --> 20:56.927
Dang it, old man,
now's not the time!

20:57.131 --> 20:58.929
Come on!
What are you <i>doing?</i>

20:59.133 --> 21:01.852
You're gonna ruin this! I've never held
hands this long, and I <i>very</i> uncomfortable!

21:02.052 --> 21:03.975
Whoa. Hey, I'm not
the enemy here, people.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.899
Don't forget who literally
created the end of the world.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.478
I'm sorry, Stanley. I know.
Just help me fix it! Please!

21:10.686 --> 21:13.690
Fine. Just do one thing.
Say "thank you."

21:13.898 --> 21:15.571
What?
I spent thirty years

21:15.775 --> 21:17.277
trying to bring you back
into this dimension,

21:17.485 --> 21:19.158
and you still
haven't thanked me!

21:19.361 --> 21:20.954
You want me
to shake your hand?

21:21.155 --> 21:23.203
Say "thank you"!

21:23.407 --> 21:25.284
Fine. Thank you.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.961
Now, see?

21:27.161 --> 21:29.755
Between me and him, I'm not
always the bad twin.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.834
Between "him and me."

21:33.375 --> 21:34.376
Grammar, Stanley.

21:34.585 --> 21:37.805
I'll "Grammar, Stanley" <i>you,</i>
you stuck-up son-of-a--

21:38.005 --> 21:39.348
Don't jeopardize this,
you idiot!

21:39.548 --> 21:41.892
FORD: Everything's on the line!
Stop it!

21:42.092 --> 21:45.266
(both shouting)
DIPPER: Join hands!

21:45.471 --> 21:47.599
<i>BILL: Oh, no, it's Bill!</i>

21:47.807 --> 21:50.606
<i>Right? Isn't that what
you're all thinking?</i>

21:50.810 --> 21:52.778
<i>Hey, Gideon,
why aren't you dancing?</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:54.446
<i>Chop chop, huh?</i>

21:59.860 --> 22:00.611
BILL: Ha <i>ha</i> ha ho!

22:00.820 --> 22:02.914
<i>This is just too perfect!</i>

22:03.113 --> 22:05.366
<i>Didn't you brainiacs know
the zodiac doesn't work</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:07.292
<i>if you don't all hold hands?</i>

22:07.493 --> 22:08.870
<i>And what's better,</i>

22:09.078 --> 22:10.830
<i>you've brought every
threat to my power together</i>

22:11.872 --> 22:12.873
<i>in one easy-to-destroy circle!</i>

22:14.416 --> 22:15.508
(QBSPS)
Oh, no!

22:15.668 --> 22:17.386
Aaah! My hair!

22:17.545 --> 22:19.513
Aaah! My hair also!

22:21.298 --> 22:23.392
<i>You guys want to see
what happens to your friends</i>

22:23.592 --> 22:25.014
<i>when you can't get along?</i>

22:25.219 --> 22:26.766
Hey! You give them back!

22:26.971 --> 22:28.644
You've gone too far,
cipher!

22:28.848 --> 22:32.227
Yeah! We're not
scared of you!

22:32.434 --> 22:34.027
<i>Oh, but you should be.</i>

22:39.567 --> 22:41.069
Aaah!
Oh, no!

22:41.277 --> 22:45.953
<i>Ya know, this castle could
really use some decoration!</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:50.586
(thunder crashing)

22:50.786 --> 22:52.003
(both gasp)

22:52.204 --> 22:54.457
<i>Looks like it's too late
for your friends, Stanford!</i>

22:54.665 --> 22:56.838
(both yell)
Kids!

22:57.042 --> 22:58.840
<i>But you can still
save your family!</i>

22:59.044 --> 23:02.139
<i>Last chance: Tell me how to take
Weirdmageddon global</i>

23:02.339 --> 23:03.465
<i>and I'll spare the kids!</i>

23:03.674 --> 23:05.221
No! Don't do it!
Yeah!

23:05.426 --> 23:07.099
Bill makes bad deals!

23:07.303 --> 23:09.351
<i>Don't you toy with me,
shooting star!</i>

23:09.555 --> 23:12.308
<i>I see everything!</i>

23:12.516 --> 23:14.143
<i>Ow! Not again!</i>

23:14.351 --> 23:15.648
<i>Why?! Every time!</i>

23:15.853 --> 23:17.321
Nice shot, pumpkin!

23:17.521 --> 23:19.649
<i>I just regenerated that eye!</i>

23:19.857 --> 23:21.154
I know that hurts,

23:21.358 --> 23:23.360
because I've accidentally
done it to myself--

23:23.569 --> 23:25.446
multiple times!

23:28.198 --> 23:29.825
<i>Aaah! Aaah!</i>

23:30.034 --> 23:30.876
Save yourselves!

23:31.076 --> 23:32.828
Run! We'll take care of Bill!

23:33.037 --> 23:34.789
What?!
That's a suicide mission!

23:34.997 --> 23:36.715
Trust us.
We've beat him before...

23:36.916 --> 23:38.964
and we'll beat him
again!

23:40.336 --> 23:42.759
Hey, Bill! Come and get us,

23:42.963 --> 23:44.510
you pointy jerk!

23:44.715 --> 23:45.762
<i>(Bill howls)</i>

23:47.384 --> 23:49.557
What? No!
It's too dangerous!

23:51.221 --> 23:54.065
<i>Not so fast!
You two wait here!</i>

23:54.224 --> 23:58.479
<i>I've got some children
I need to make into corpses!</i>

23:58.687 --> 24:00.815
<i>(monster voice)
See ya real soon!</i>

24:01.148 --> 24:02.445
-(cackling)
- Bill, no!

24:04.902 --> 24:06.870
What do we do?
what do we do?

24:07.071 --> 24:07.913
Kids!

24:08.113 --> 24:11.208
- (kids panting)
- (Bill roaring)

24:12.159 --> 24:13.957
<i>When I get my hands
on you kids,</i>

24:14.161 --> 24:17.040
<i>I'm gonna disassemble
your molecules!</i>

24:19.917 --> 24:22.591
<i>You've tricked me
for the last time!</i>

24:22.795 --> 24:23.921
(both screaming)

24:26.423 --> 24:28.767
GRUNKLE STAN:
Ohh! I can't <i>believe</i> this!

24:28.968 --> 24:30.970
The kids are gonna die,
and it's all my fault--

24:31.178 --> 24:36.184
because I couldn't shake
your stupid hand!

24:36.392 --> 24:37.814
Ahh, Dad was right about me.
I am a screw-up.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.104
Ah, don't blame yourself.
I'm the one

24:40.312 --> 24:42.406
who made a deal with Bill
in the first place.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.783
I fell for all
his easy flattery.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.658
You would have seen him
for the scam artist he is.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.580
How did things get so
messed up between us?

24:50.781 --> 24:52.533
We used to be
like Dipper and Mabel.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.539
The world's about to end
and they still work together.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.916
How do they do it?
Easy. They're kids.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.419
They don't know any better.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.624
<i>Whoa, where you gain'?</i>

25:00.833 --> 25:02.585
I'm gonna play
the only card we have left.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.420
Let Bill into my mind.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.380
He'll be able
to take over the galaxy,

25:06.588 --> 25:07.931
and maybe even worse,

25:08.132 --> 25:09.759
but at least he <i>might</i>
let the kids free.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.685
What?! Are you kiddin' me?!

25:11.885 --> 25:14.013
Are you honestly telling me
there's nothing else we can do?!

25:14.221 --> 25:15.894
Bill's only weak
in the mind space.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.896
If I didn't have this darn plate
in my head,

25:18.100 --> 25:20.068
we could just erase him
with the memory gun

25:20.269 --> 25:22.021
when he steps
inside my mind.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.947
What if he goes
into my mind?

25:24.148 --> 25:26.242
- My brain isn't good for anything.
-(chuckles)

25:26.442 --> 25:29.286
There's nothing in your mind
he wants. It has to be me.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.988
We need to take his deal.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.540
It's the only way he'll agree
to save you and the kids.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.869
Do you really think he's gonna
make good on that deal?

25:36.076 --> 25:38.170
What other choice
do we have?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.548
22:2:

25:41.749 --> 25:44.423
DIPPER: I'm starting to think
there's no way out of here.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.503
Like Grunkle Stan always says,

25:46.712 --> 25:47.964
when one door closes,

25:48.172 --> 25:50.015
choose a nearby wall
and bash it in

25:50.215 --> 25:51.387
with brute force!

25:51.592 --> 25:53.094
(grunting)

25:53.302 --> 25:54.849
Aaaaah!

25:55.054 --> 25:57.273
Ha! Now let's round up
the townsfolk,

25:57.473 --> 25:59.020
and together
we can defeat--

25:59.224 --> 26:00.521
Oh, no!

26:02.019 --> 26:03.191
(all laughing)

26:03.395 --> 26:05.523
You'll never
take us alive, monsters!

26:05.731 --> 26:07.825
That's fine with us!

26:08.025 --> 26:09.117
(all cry out)

26:09.276 --> 26:12.155
<i>Oh, no:
BILL: Peek-a-boo!</i>

26:12.362 --> 26:14.080
(both scream)

26:16.075 --> 26:18.703
<i>All right, Ford,
time's up!</i>

26:20.287 --> 26:22.085
<i>I've got the kids!</i>

26:22.289 --> 26:24.087
<i>I think I'm gonna
kill one of 'em now,</i>

26:24.249 --> 26:25.717
<i>just for the heck of it!</i>

26:25.876 --> 26:28.345
<i>Eeenie-meenie...</i>

26:28.545 --> 26:30.673
<i>minee...</i>

26:30.881 --> 26:32.007
FORD: Wait!

26:34.009 --> 26:34.805
I surrender!

26:35.844 --> 26:37.562
Good choice.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.607
STAN: Don't do it, Ford!
It'll destroy the universe!

26:40.808 --> 26:42.401
FORD:
It's the only way!

26:42.559 --> 26:43.731
<i>(Bill cackling)</i>

26:43.936 --> 26:45.483
<i>Even when you're about to die,</i>

26:45.687 --> 26:47.439
<i>you Pines twins just
can't get along!</i>

26:50.067 --> 26:51.159
My only condition

26:51.360 --> 26:53.158
is that you let my brother
and the kids go.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.579
<i>Fine.</i>

26:54.780 --> 26:56.578
No, Grunkle Ford!
Don't trust him!

26:59.993 --> 27:02.291
<i>It's a...deal!</i>

27:10.546 --> 27:13.015
<i>(cackling)</i>

27:19.513 --> 27:22.642
<i>Oh, I'm here.
I'm finally here!</i>

27:22.850 --> 27:26.605
<i>Look at this place--
a perfect, calm, orderly void.</i>

27:26.812 --> 27:28.439
<i>Gotta hand it to you, Ford,</i>

27:28.647 --> 27:31.446
<i>you really know
how to clear your--</i>

27:31.650 --> 27:32.776
(clicks tongue)

27:32.985 --> 27:33.827
<i>What?!</i>

27:34.027 --> 27:35.870
Ha ha! Do a pretty good
impression

27:36.071 --> 27:37.163
of my brother, don't I?

27:37.364 --> 27:39.412
Switch clothes and no one
can tell us apart.

27:39.616 --> 27:42.415
Welcome to my mind.
Surprised you didn't recognize it.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.722
<i>What?! The deal's off!</i>

27:55.549 --> 27:57.551
<i>What the--
No, no, no, no!</i>

27:57.759 --> 27:59.853
STAN: Oh, yeah.
You're goin' down, Bill.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.475
You're gettin' erased.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.853
Memory gun.
Pretty clever, huh?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.934
<i>Y-You idiot!
Don't you realize</i>

28:06.143 --> 28:08.771
<i>you're destroying
your own mind too?</i>

28:08.979 --> 28:11.858
Eh. It's not like I was using
this space for much anyway.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.317
<i>Let me out of here!
Let me--</i>

28:13.525 --> 28:15.869
<i>Oh-- Why isn't this working?!</i>

28:16.069 --> 28:18.037
Hey, look at me.
Turn around and look at me,

28:18.238 --> 28:19.581
you one-eyed demon!

28:19.781 --> 28:22.785
You're a real wiseguy,
but you made one fatal mistake.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.586
You messed with my family.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.083
<i>You're making a mistake!</i>

28:26.288 --> 28:28.757
<i>I'll give you anything--
money, fame, riches,</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:30.800
<i>infinite power,
your own galaxy!</i>

28:31.835 --> 28:32.552
<i>Please! No!</i>

28:32.753 --> 28:34.801
<i>What's happening to me?!</i>

28:35.839 --> 28:38.809
<i>(Bill's voice
fragments and distorts)</i>

28:41.595 --> 28:43.814
<i>Staaanleeey!</i>

28:44.014 --> 28:46.392
<i>Aaaaah!!!</i>

28:47.851 --> 28:49.979
(panting)

28:55.067 --> 28:58.367
Heh. Guess I was good
for something after all.

29:06.078 --> 29:06.920
(Clank)

29:10.249 --> 29:11.842
(all grunt)

(roars,
screams)

29:19.091 --> 29:20.968
(all screaming)

29:21.176 --> 29:22.678
Hey!Hey!

29:24.304 --> 29:26.147
BOTH: Oh...0hh!

29:40.362 --> 29:44.162

Huh.

(wind whistling)

30:05.470 --> 30:07.017
oh! my gosh!

30:07.222 --> 30:08.724
Grunkle Stan,
you did it!

30:08.932 --> 30:11.936
Oh, uh, hey there...
kiddo.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.646
What's your name?

30:13.854 --> 30:15.606
Grunkle Stan?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.816
Heh. Who ya talkin' to?

30:18.025 --> 30:20.153
C-Come on.
It's me.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.953
It's me, Grunkle Stan!

30:22.154 --> 30:24.782
Grunkle Stan, it's me!

30:24.990 --> 30:27.618
We had to erase his mind
to defeat Bill.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.827
It's all gone.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.164
Stan has no idea,
but he did it.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.839
He saved the world.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.633
He saved me.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.839
You're our hero, Stanley.
(sniffles)

30:40.047 --> 30:43.802
(crying)

30:58.940 --> 31:00.533
(Dipper grunting)

31:09.409 --> 31:12.037
Hey, this is a real nice place
ya got here.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.082
It's <i>your</i> place,
Grunkle Stan.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.588
Don't you remember?
Even a little?

31:17.584 --> 31:20.087
Nope, but this chair
hugs my butt like it remembers.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.968
Ah.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.934
Hey, why the long faces?

31:26.134 --> 31:27.932
You guys look like
it's someone's funeral.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.934
Who's that big guy
crying in the corner?

31:30.138 --> 31:31.310
(sobbing)

31:31.515 --> 31:33.893
We saved the world,
but what's the point?

31:34.101 --> 31:36.024
Grunkle Stan's
not himself anymore.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.027
There's gotta be something
we can do to jog his memory!

31:39.231 --> 31:41.905
There isn't.
I'm sorry. Stan's gone.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.658
I know my Grunkle is
in there somewhere!

31:44.861 --> 31:46.033
There's gotta be
something around here

31:46.238 --> 31:47.740
that can help
bring him back!

31:51.076 --> 31:53.044
This'll work!
This has to work!

31:53.245 --> 31:55.964
Here's the first day we came
to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.384
And here's a macaroni
interpretation of my emotions.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.798
That time
we went fishing.

32:05.841 --> 32:06.763
That Summerween
we spent together.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.765
Don't you remember
anything?

32:08.969 --> 32:10.767
I'm sorry. I don't know
what this is

32:10.929 --> 32:12.806
or who you are or--gah!

32:13.014 --> 32:13.731
Quit it, Waddles!

32:13.932 --> 32:15.309
I'm trying to remember
my life story!

32:15.517 --> 32:16.814
What did you say?

32:17.018 --> 32:18.520
I said get Waddles off of me!

32:18.728 --> 32:20.901
It's working!
Keep reading!

32:22.190 --> 32:24.409
He needs to remember our
boss-employee relationship.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.861
Hey! Just cause I have amnesia,

32:26.069 --> 32:27.821
don't go tryin' to give
yourself a raise, Soos.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.201
It's happening!
Keep going!

32:29.406 --> 32:30.578
OK. OK!

32:30.782 --> 32:33.160
"Day Two.
Grunkle Stan smells weird

32:33.368 --> 32:34.836
but we're
starting to bond.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.794
He told us a lot about being
a businessman in the '80s

32:37.998 --> 32:39.796
and seemed happy when
we pretended to listen.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.923
He also gave me
a grappling hook

32:42.127 --> 32:43.595
which everyone
is impressed by.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.796
And in more important news,

32:45.839 --> 32:46.806
I've met some
neighborhood hotties!"

32:47.841 --> 32:49.514
(afllaugh)

32:59.227 --> 33:01.446
SHANDRA:
<i>Good Morning, Gravity Falls!</i>

33:01.646 --> 33:04.650
<i>It's another beautiful day,
but every day is beautiful</i>

33:04.858 --> 33:07.987
<i>now that the...
unpleasantness is over.</i>

33:08.195 --> 33:11.199
(bats screeching)
Git outta here, ya ornery critters!

33:11.406 --> 33:13.124
(roaring)

33:14.784 --> 33:16.286
Ah, good as new.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.166
Oh! Looks like
you've got a friend!

33:20.373 --> 33:23.547
Robbie, would you be a dear and
get us the sawed off shotgun?

33:23.752 --> 33:26.631
Ugh. Fine,
whatever.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.590
Brains and so forth!

33:28.798 --> 33:30.800
Nope! None of that,
thank you.

33:31.843 --> 33:32.594
(laughing)

33:32.802 --> 33:34.770
None of us really understand
what just happened,

33:34.971 --> 33:36.143
and none of us want to.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.568
That's why I'm passing
the Never Mind All That Act.

33:39.768 --> 33:43.818
If anyone goes asking around about
the "events" of the last few days,

33:44.022 --> 33:45.695
what do we say?

33:45.899 --> 33:47.867
CROWD:
Never Mind All That!

33:48.068 --> 33:50.412
And if you break the rules,
we're gonna zap ya!

33:50.612 --> 33:51.579
Zap! Zap!

33:51.780 --> 33:53.748
We're mad with power!

33:53.949 --> 33:55.792
BOTH:
And love.

33:55.951 --> 33:56.952
SHANDRA:
<i>In other news,</i>

33:57.160 --> 33:58.753
<i>the Northwest family
has gone broke.</i>

33:58.954 --> 34:00.422
<i>After pledging
his allegiance to Bill</i>

34:00.622 --> 34:02.841
<i>and then placing all
his savings in weirdness bonds,</i>

34:03.041 --> 34:05.214
<i>Preston Northwest
had to sell his mansion</i>

34:05.418 --> 34:07.716
<i>to preserve his family fortune.</i>

34:07.921 --> 34:11.016
You're only going to
have one pony now!

34:15.178 --> 34:18.523
But fortunes have also turned for
local maniac Fiddleford McGucket

34:18.723 --> 34:20.646
who, after regaining his sanity,

34:20.850 --> 34:22.898
has made millions overnight
submitting his patents

34:23.103 --> 34:23.820
to the US government.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.273
I'm gonna buy me a bigger shed!

34:26.481 --> 34:28.108
Hey, that one's for sale!

34:28.315 --> 34:30.864
In other good news,
town hero Stanley Pines

34:31.069 --> 34:33.743
has fully recovered his memory
and will be throwing a party

34:33.947 --> 34:36.541
to celebrate his niece and
nephew's thirteenth birthday

34:36.741 --> 34:38.038
and final day in town.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.870
But other than that,
I can safely say

34:40.078 --> 34:42.547
our beloved Gravity Falls
is back to normal.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.295
And now, Bodacious T,
with sports.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.922
It's called Death Ball!

34:48.128 --> 34:50.005
ALL:
♪ ...to you ♪

34:50.213 --> 34:51.681
(squeals)

34:51.880 --> 34:54.475
(all cheering)

34:54.676 --> 34:56.474
I can't believe you all
got together

34:56.678 --> 34:58.476
just to throw
a party for us!

34:58.680 --> 35:00.978
After all the Pines family
has done for the town,

35:01.182 --> 35:02.775
it's the least
we could do!

35:02.976 --> 35:04.774
You've helped
everyone here.

35:04.978 --> 35:05.774
Thanks to y'all savin' us,

35:05.937 --> 35:07.735
I learned to open
my heart to kindness.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.782
No more evil-doin'.

35:09.983 --> 35:12.736
From now on, I'm gonna
try to be Li'l Gideon,

35:12.944 --> 35:14.537
regular ol' kid.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.537
Oh-- Ha ha! Whoo!

35:17.741 --> 35:20.369
I am bustin' a move
on this skatin' board.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.796
More like busting
your pants, loser!

35:22.996 --> 35:24.748
Heh heh heh heh!

35:29.419 --> 35:30.762
(blows landing)
(boy screams)

35:30.920 --> 35:32.297
Hee hee hee!

35:32.505 --> 35:33.757
Dude, make a wish, dawg!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.933
Ya know, on my
first day here,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.102
if you had asked me what I
wanted, I would have said

35:38.303 --> 35:40.931
adventure, mystery,
true friends.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.391
But looking here at all of you,

35:42.557 --> 35:44.605
I realize that
every wish came true--

35:44.809 --> 35:46.937
I have everything
I wanted.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.112
If I had only one wish,

35:48.313 --> 35:49.940
it would be to shrink all
of you with a shrink ray

35:50.148 --> 35:51.821
and bring you home
with us in my pocket.

35:52.025 --> 35:52.776
But since that's impossible--

35:52.984 --> 35:55.157
Is that impossible?

35:55.362 --> 35:57.740
Since that's
<i>probably</i> impossible,

35:57.947 --> 36:00.450
my only wish is for everyone
to sign my scrapbook.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.957
I'll never
forget you guys.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.333
Wait.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.505
Now I'll never
forget you guys!

36:14.214 --> 36:17.889
I now officially declare you:
technically teenagers.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.970
Welcome to
Angst and Acne Forever.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.851
ALL CHANT:
One of us! One of us!

36:22.055 --> 36:24.604
Whoo-hee!
Whoopee!

36:24.808 --> 36:25.684
So how do you feel?

36:25.892 --> 36:27.860
Samey,
but differenty.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.278
PACIFICA: Hey, you two.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.026
When are you gonna
open your presents already?

36:31.231 --> 36:33.279
I broke a nail wrapping them.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.985
Ha ha!
Pacifica.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.865
Stanley, I need
to talk to you.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.075
I didn't want to say anything
with everyone listening,

36:42.283 --> 36:43.876
but we've got
a problem.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.795
Weirdmageddon
has been contained,

36:45.954 --> 36:48.207
but I'm detecting
some strange new anomalies

36:48.415 --> 36:49.291
near the Arctic Ocean.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.842
I want to go investigate it,

36:51.042 --> 36:53.386
but I think I might be
too old to go it alone.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.805
Are you sayin' you
need someone to help you

36:56.005 --> 36:58.474
sail around the world on the
adventure of a lifetime?

36:58.675 --> 37:01.895
I don't just want someone
to come with me, Stanley.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.347
I want it to be you.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.307
Will you give me
a second chance?

37:05.515 --> 37:08.610
You think we'll find treasure?
And babes?

37:08.810 --> 37:11.154
Ha! I'd say there's
a high probability!

37:11.354 --> 37:13.106
But what should we do
with the Mystery Shack?

37:13.314 --> 37:15.908
I think the town's had enough
mystery for one lifetime.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.362
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

37:18.570 --> 37:20.993
(Stan, Ford whispering)

37:21.197 --> 37:22.915
(bell ringing)
GRUNKLE STAN: Everyone,

37:23.116 --> 37:24.413
I have an announcement
to make.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.961
Me and my--heh!--
nerdy bro over here

37:27.162 --> 37:29.790
have some catchin' up to do,
we're gonna be away for a while.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.968
That's why I'm shutting down
the Mystery Shack for good!

37:33.168 --> 37:35.921
(all gasp)

37:36.129 --> 37:38.552
You shut down
your <i>mouth</i> for good!

37:40.008 --> 37:41.510
I'm sorry, Mr. Pineses,

37:41.718 --> 37:43.937
it's just that this shack is the
most magical place on earth.

37:44.137 --> 37:45.514
Sure, the attractions
are all fake,

37:45.722 --> 37:47.269
but dreams aren't fake.

37:47.474 --> 37:48.726
Like this mermaid:

37:48.933 --> 37:51.607
It's not just a dead fish butt
sewn to a monkey carcass,

37:51.811 --> 37:53.063
it's a marvelous creature

37:53.271 --> 37:55.615
that makes us believe
that anything is possible.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.694
You shut down this shack,
and you shut down our dreams!

37:59.819 --> 38:01.992
At least... my dreams.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.699
ALL: Aw.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.706
(sighs) I'm sorry, Soos,

38:06.910 --> 38:09.584
it's just there's no one
around to run it.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.882
At least there <i>wouldn</i> 't be

38:12.081 --> 38:14.709
if I hadn't just found
the perfect replacement.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.929
Ladies and gentlemen, the Mystery
Shack is under new management!

38:21.132 --> 38:22.258
(all cheer)

38:22.467 --> 38:24.845
You...you mean it,
Mister Mystery?

38:25.053 --> 38:26.646
You're Mister Mystery now,
Soos.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.974
Try not to burn
the place down.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.059
I'll move in immediately.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.268
(truck beeping)

38:32.477 --> 38:34.946
(all cheering)

38:38.525 --> 38:40.948
(birds chirping)

38:52.330 --> 38:54.298
Do you <i>really</i>
have to go?

38:54.499 --> 38:56.251
There is still so much
we haven't done together.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.177
Summer's over,
Candy.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.255
It's time for us
to grow up.

39:00.463 --> 39:01.840
But not
<i>too</i> much.

39:02.048 --> 39:05.302
Aaah! I hate my dumb heart
for making me feel things!

39:05.510 --> 39:07.638
Cut. It. Out. Heart!

39:07.846 --> 39:09.564
Hey, can you punch
my heart too?

39:09.764 --> 39:12.608
No, mine!
Punch my feelings away!

39:14.602 --> 39:15.854
Candy and Grenda,

39:16.062 --> 39:17.939
thank you for
being my people.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.866
You'll always be
my best friends.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.741
Grunkle Stan, thanks for wearing
my Goodbye sweater.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.368
Ah, it's cold out.
I had to.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.871
What? But it's, like, eighty-something
degrees out today.

39:29.075 --> 39:29.951
BOTH: Can it, Soos!

39:30.159 --> 39:32.662
(afllaugh)

39:34.455 --> 39:37.834
Hey. You mean a lot to me,
man.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.919
You too.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.220
Something to
remember me by.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.553
Oh, and this.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.809
Read it the next time
you miss Gravity Falls.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.774
Last bus leaving Gravity Falls.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.946
All aboard.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.366
Guess we said goodbye
to everyone except...

40:01.566 --> 40:03.489
Waddles.

40:03.693 --> 40:07.869
I...don't know
how to explain this, but...

40:08.072 --> 40:11.872
Mom and Dad won't let me
bring a pig home to California, so...

40:12.076 --> 40:14.295
you have to stay here!

40:15.413 --> 40:17.040
(squeals)

40:18.541 --> 40:20.134
Come on, come on!

40:20.335 --> 40:21.803
I have to <i>go.</i>

40:22.837 --> 40:23.929
I'm...I'm sorry, Waddles!

40:25.798 --> 40:27.345
You know what? Forget it!

40:27.550 --> 40:29.052
I lived with this pig
all summer,

40:29.218 --> 40:31.061
now <i>your</i> parents
are gonna have to!

40:31.262 --> 40:32.935
Hey, bus gLIY!

40:33.139 --> 40:34.891
This pig is coming
with the kids!

40:35.099 --> 40:36.316
Now, hold on a second.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.939
Bringing animals aboard
a moving vehicle

40:38.144 --> 40:39.316
is strictly prohibited
by--

40:42.982 --> 40:45.451
Wah-- Welcome aboard.

40:45.652 --> 40:47.450
You can sit in
the front row, pig.

40:49.781 --> 40:53.160
Kids, you knuckleheads
were nothin' but a nuisance

40:53.368 --> 40:54.961
and I'm glad to be rid of ya.

40:58.164 --> 41:01.043
We'll miss you too,
Grunkle Stan.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.933
Ready to head
into the unknown?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.760
Nope.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.725
Let's do it.

41:22.563 --> 41:26.818
(all shouting farewells)

41:27.860 --> 41:29.453
Bye! Bye, everybody!
I'll miss you guys too!

41:29.654 --> 41:31.873
SOOS: Bye, dudes! Bye!

41:42.500 --> 41:44.548
DIPPER: <i>If you've ever taken</i> a <i>road
trip through the Pacific Northwest,</i>

41:44.752 --> 41:46.379

<i>for a place

41:51.676 --> 41:53.349

41:53.553 --> 41:55.180
<i>It's not on any maps,</i>
