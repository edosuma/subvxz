Hey.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.338
What kind of coffee
do you want'?

00:40.332 --> 00:42.460
Hazelnut! Hazelnut!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.591
What if your name was Zul Nut?

00:44.670 --> 00:46.764
And then I would be
like "Hey, Zul Nut!"

00:46.838 --> 00:48.306
That's terrible.

Susan Strong!

01:04.063 --> 01:05.691
Finn?

01:05.774 --> 01:07.492
Help Susan.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.945
Of course I will.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.871
Excuse us for a moment, Strong.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.543
Dude, you know you're my Bro,
but that girl is bad news.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.120
What?! Nah.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.830
She's crazy, man.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.007
She's a fish person.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.083
We don't know that.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.292
Dude!

01:24.376 --> 01:26.253
She tried to eat
Peppermint Butler.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.180
She'd probably do worse if she
weren't so scared of everything.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.475
Whatever. Look, she
needs my help.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.903
And I'm gonna help her whether
you're coming with me or not.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.270
Oh, I'm coming with you.

01:35.345 --> 01:39.600
If only to be disruptive
and obnoxious!

01:39.683 --> 01:41.481
Susan, what can we do?

01:41.560 --> 01:46.407
I need your hero heart
and your magic.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.154
My magic?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.827
Magic of red flower.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.931
Uhh.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.428
Fish people.

02:12.507 --> 02:18.264
Long ago, my people
live in Beautopia.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.476
But driven out by Lubglubs.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.650

02:49.252 --> 02:50.754
No, you don't understand.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.963
I'm not a fish person.

02:52.047 --> 02:52.923
I'm human.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.383
We go.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.402
What?! Hey! Hey! What?

03:13.485 --> 03:16.329

Oh, no. Oh, no.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.982

03:48.061 --> 03:49.654
No, Susan, no!

04:02.659 --> 04:03.751
That was awesome.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.625
See, Jake? We can trust Susan.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.502
She's on the trolley.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.461
Keep looking for Lubglub.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.767
No move.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.766
Whew.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.197
Dude, she's crazy.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.152
She's not crazy.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.031
She's cool.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.328
Whatever, man.

04:39.404 --> 04:43.454
This is a crazy cruise, and
Susan is our crazy Captain.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.379
And I'm a crazy clamshell!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.456
Boooo-eeep!

04:49.539 --> 04:51.462
Ooh! Oh! Doin' the clam!

05:29.079 --> 05:31.673
Uh, Finn, let's get out of here.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.625
Come on. She knows this place.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.051
Trust.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.469
Ready when you are, Susan.
