00:10.733 --> 00:11.800
Your pals found a package

00:11.833 --> 00:14.300
that belonged
to a coupla Degens
the other day.

00:14.333 --> 00:19.100
ALL: You're wrong, you're wrong
you're wrong.
WAYNE: Hey!

00:19.133 --> 00:21.200
Where was it?
Dollar Store parking lot.

00:21.233 --> 00:22.666
Tell him whose it was.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.100
Soupy Campbell's
and Spider Creemanse's.

00:24.133 --> 00:25.533
KATY: Argh.

00:25.566 --> 00:26.666
Well, did you open it?

00:26.700 --> 00:28.800
Nope. Popped in right back
in the mailbox. Proper thing.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.133
Shoulda opened it.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.000
That just didn't feels right
on accounts that it wasn't ours.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.633
Well, by the rules
of 'finders keepers,'
it was yours.

00:34.666 --> 00:35.533
So you shoulda opened it.

00:35.566 --> 00:37.233
Yeah, it was our guyses
by the rights.

00:37.266 --> 00:38.633
I begs to differ.

00:38.666 --> 00:41.000
Even though we founds it,
it was still technically
their guyses.

00:41.033 --> 00:43.033
It was yours, fair and square.

00:43.066 --> 00:44.333
With all dues respects,
Miss Katys,

00:44.366 --> 00:47.266
it was them fellowses,
just landed in our guyses
hands brieflys.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.100
Hmm, I'm with Katy.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.566
It was our guyses.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.300
And now we'll never know
what was in Soupy's
and Spider's package.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.800
That's what I said.

00:54.833 --> 00:55.966
Looks, I know what
you're thinking.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.633
You're thinking,
"You guyses
let yer consciences

00:58.666 --> 01:00.633
"get in the way
of something that was
rightfully your guyses."

01:00.666 --> 01:02.633
And you might be right.
She's right.

01:02.666 --> 01:04.566
Their guyses loss
is our guyses gain.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.133
There's something
not right here.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.800
Not pertaining
to whose package
it was, but just...

01:08.833 --> 01:10.233
like the English language
part of it

01:10.266 --> 01:12.033
You guys keep saying,
"Your guyses,"

01:12.066 --> 01:14.800
and "Our guyses,"
and "Them fellowhases."

01:16.800 --> 01:19.633
Okay, just, 'kay,
you know what, 'kay,

01:19.666 --> 01:21.833
what say Katy and I
find a wallet.

01:21.866 --> 01:23.600
Whose wallet is it?

01:23.633 --> 01:25.133
Yours and Katyses.
No.

01:26.266 --> 01:28.666
Wayneses and Katy...ses.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.600
It's ours.
Correct.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.133
Or Katy's and mine.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.300
You know what, it kinda chaps
my ass more than just a wee bit

01:34.333 --> 01:36.300
when people use big words
to sound smart.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.100
It's far more smart
and efficient

01:38.133 --> 01:39.300
to use small words.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.266
Save your breath
for something more important,

01:41.300 --> 01:43.133
like chorin' or toe curlin'.

01:43.166 --> 01:45.200
Hmm, especially toe curlin'.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.700
You know, I thinks I know
what you'res insinuating
at here, Wayne.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.133
And I want you to know
I take great solstice

01:49.166 --> 01:50.800
in working through all
the conflictions that come

01:50.833 --> 01:52.066
from the King and Queens
language.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.000
Shall I call you
an ambleance, Dan?

01:54.033 --> 01:56.266
Or better yet, a whambleance?

01:56.300 --> 01:57.933
The library has a lots
of choice literature

01:57.966 --> 01:59.566
to help through
your confliction, Dan.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.600
Well, the lie‐berry's is full
of choice laterature.

02:01.633 --> 02:02.733
Irregardlessly...

02:04.033 --> 02:05.166
expresso.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.000
Ooh, now that one's so wrong,
it might as well be right.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.266
In any event,

02:10.300 --> 02:12.566
the decision on
what happens
to the package,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.266
is Darylses,
and Danses,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.233
not mine and Katyses.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.000
But you did
the right thing, Dan.

02:19.033 --> 02:21.133
Well, thank you.
I appreciate yer support.

02:22.066 --> 02:22.866
Sssss.

02:25.033 --> 02:26.100
Hey, have you
ever seen that movie,

02:26.133 --> 02:27.866
There's Something About Mary?

02:27.900 --> 02:31.166
Bet you didn't know
they're making a Canadian
version. Yeah.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.133
It's gonna be called,
There's Something About Marie.

02:33.166 --> 02:36.133
(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

02:45.033 --> 02:48.600
Guys by applause,
who agrees with me on this.

02:48.633 --> 02:50.566
Women are like cats.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.600
Men are like dogs, right?

02:54.766 --> 02:56.066
Oh, yeah, case in point.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.866
There's your waitress,
everyone.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.633

(SLIGHT CLAPPING)

02:59.666 --> 03:01.000
MAN: Yeah, Bonnie.

03:01.033 --> 03:02.166
Don't forget the tip.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.566
Actually, you should give her
more than just the tip,

03:04.600 --> 03:06.900
tip her on her back
and smash her, yeah!

03:06.933 --> 03:07.866
(MAN BANGS TABLE) Oy!

03:07.900 --> 03:10.166
How about I tip you
on your back and smash you

03:10.200 --> 03:11.600
with a rusty rebar,

03:11.633 --> 03:13.033
until you apologize
to my sister,

03:13.066 --> 03:14.733
you shitty fuckin' citiot.

03:14.766 --> 03:16.200
I'll smash you too
that' all I know.

03:16.233 --> 03:19.033
Okay, what's your problem
tighty‐whitey?

03:19.066 --> 03:22.700
Jeez, it's like Mr. Clean
shopped at Baby Gap, right?

03:22.733 --> 03:25.066
You're gonna be shopping
for a new suit at the morgue

03:25.100 --> 03:27.633
unless you take a log
off that fire, pussy!

03:27.666 --> 03:28.800
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

03:28.833 --> 03:32.300
Yeah, all right, settle down,
Olaf from <i>Frozen.</i>

03:32.333 --> 03:34.666
You forget that shirt
in the dryer for three years

03:34.700 --> 03:37.766
and now, it's cutting off
all the oxygen to your brain.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.133
Settle down,
you can breathe.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.833
Get the fuck

03:40.866 --> 03:42.800

03:45.566 --> 03:48.533
why did the chicken cross
the road?
Why?

03:48.566 --> 03:50.200
To get the fuck out
of Letterkenny.

03:50.233 --> 03:51.833
This place fuckin' sucks!

03:51.866 --> 03:53.633

03:53.666 --> 03:56.533
Oh, yeah. Nice. What am

03:56.566 --> 03:58.633
You guys run fast.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.133
Wow, I thought you guys
would appreciate that.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.766
It's racist,
just like you.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.833
Okay! Thanks very much,
Letterkenny.
(CROWD BOOING)

04:04.866 --> 04:07.700
This has been
the exact opposite of fun.

04:07.733 --> 04:09.833
Too bad the show wasn't
in Betterkenny,

04:09.866 --> 04:12.266
'cause you guys
are the worst audience ever!

funny man.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.133
What the fuck?

04:19.166 --> 04:21.233
MCMURRAY: This is a real place.
You think this is easy?

04:21.266 --> 04:24.033
Think it's so fuckin' easy.
Why don't you
try it yourselves?

04:27.833 --> 04:29.000
REILLY: What's up boys?

04:29.033 --> 04:30.100
What's up, tank top?

04:30.133 --> 04:32.200
Aw, looks like you guys
could use a bit of a tune‐up.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.566
Yeah, summer shape
is slip sliding away, boys.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.000
You're letting yourselves go
a little bit, eh?

04:36.033 --> 04:37.600
Getting ready
for the SAG awards?

04:37.633 --> 04:39.666
Hmm, you two are going
to be the rollsiest, pollsiest,

What are you
fuckin' blind?

04:45.066 --> 04:46.633
The fuck are you smoking boys?

04:46.666 --> 04:48.100

can use some cross‐fit.

training from you?

our before pictures.

WAYNE AND MCMURRAY:
How'r you...

05:31.100 --> 05:33.600

Not so bad.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.266
You go...

05:36.300 --> 05:38.166
Get after it.
All right. Ahem.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.833
The lovely Mrs. McMurray and I
have been doing some very
serious thinking.

05:42.966 --> 05:44.600
Maybe we should
try it ourselves.

05:44.633 --> 05:45.666
Stand up comedy?

05:45.700 --> 05:46.766
Or something similar.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.966
Well, to be fair...

05:48.000 --> 05:49.133
(SINGING) To be fair...

05:49.166 --> 05:54.733
(ALL SINGING) To be fair.

05:54.766 --> 05:57.733
To be fair, it's likely
pretty tough sledding up there,
for a stand‐up comedian.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.133
That comedian was a joke.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.033
(LAUGHING)

06:01.066 --> 06:02.700
Well that's a good one,
big hos.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.866
Thank yous.
Let me put it
this way, okay,

06:04.900 --> 06:08.100
I was this close to making
that stand‐up comic

06:08.800 --> 06:10.100
a lie‐down comic.

06:10.866 --> 06:11.900
I don't get it.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.200
Well, I'm just saying that

06:13.233 --> 06:15.166
I was thinking about
whoopin' his ass

06:15.200 --> 06:16.900
and so I imagined

06:16.933 --> 06:18.733
he would have been
lying down had I done that.

06:18.766 --> 06:20.233
Well, see there you go,
point and proof

06:20.266 --> 06:22.200
you're up there trying
to be funny like a nut sack,

06:22.233 --> 06:24.066
if nobody gets your shit,
you're hooped like him.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.900
So...
So can confirm it's pretty
tough sleddin' up there

06:26.933 --> 06:28.166
for a stand‐up comedian.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.266
Ah, okay. I get it.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.533
Could use a little work.

06:31.566 --> 06:33.600
Point for test‐driving it
though.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.033
In any event...
In any event...

06:35.066 --> 06:37.966
In any event, we should
host our own talent show.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.933
That's not a bad idea.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.200
How're we gonna get
the word out?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.600
Ah, you can put it
on your fuckin' Facebooks,
likely.

06:43.633 --> 06:46.533
And whos will be preforming
at this events?

06:46.566 --> 06:47.800
Who wouldn't,
that's the question.

06:47.833 --> 06:49.266
The fuck else is there
to do around here.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.133
Jimmy Dickens should host.
So we just need judges
and a few more acts.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.766
Well, I'll judge
and so will he.
Why?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.100
ALL: Born to judge, bud.

06:56.133 --> 06:57.600
All right.
There's our judges.

06:57.633 --> 06:58.800
Now we just need
a few more acts.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.733
Would you be needing
a joke smith for this
esteems affair?

07:01.766 --> 07:05.133
'Cause I've always
wanted to try my hand
at stands ups comedy.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.200
And I've often wondered
how those courageous souls
makes it work.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.200
Salt of the earth people,
stand up comedians.

07:11.666 --> 07:12.933
For the most part.
You're in.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.900
That leaves you, Daryl.

07:15.933 --> 07:19.833
Got any special talent
you'd like to share
with the class?

07:19.866 --> 07:21.666
Oh, I don't know.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.300
I'd be half scared
to get up there.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.966
That means you'd
be half excited too.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.100
Well, we could make first prize

07:28.133 --> 07:31.600
$100 bar tab at MoDean's
if that colors the water
any different for you.

07:31.633 --> 07:32.633
He's in.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.166
Good 'nuff.
Good 'nuff.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.633
Good 'nuff.
Good 'nuff.

07:36.666 --> 07:37.866
Good 'nuff.
Good 'nuff.

07:37.900 --> 07:38.900
Good stuff.

07:44.066 --> 07:45.700
Wayne?
Dary?

07:45.733 --> 07:46.800
What'd you get me into?

07:46.833 --> 07:49.766
It's time to get back
on the horse, bud.
Oh, no.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.966
No, I took that horse out
the back side of the barn.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.800
Put her down for good.
And for good reason.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.366
Are you forgettin' where you
come from?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.533
'Cause it sounds to me
like you're forgettin'
where you come from.

07:57.566 --> 07:58.800
Are you forgettin' your roots?

07:58.833 --> 08:01.266
Your line‐dancing lineage
is legendary.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.566
You will find
no finer liners, Dary.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.966
Aunt Doreen made it
to sectionals.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.233
I was not given that gift.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.000
Aunt Doreen could
have gone to provincials.

08:08.033 --> 08:09.333
Some say she could have
gone to regionals.

08:09.366 --> 08:11.800

in the States, she would
have gone to state.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.600

have won state.

Yes.

08:23.366 --> 08:25.666
Didn't she get treated
at the Mayo Clinic?
Yes.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.833
She got her Buerger's
treated with mayo.

08:27.866 --> 08:29.800
Did she do that to ketchup
to the competition?

08:30.733 --> 08:32.766
Did she ketchup?
Yes.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.566
And despite her Buerger's,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.066
she never beefed with anyone.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.700
She relished a challenge.

08:37.733 --> 08:39.633
That was a challenge
that she relished.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.066

08:41.100 --> 08:42.966
She worked her buns off.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.966
She worked the buns
off her Buergers.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.200

08:52.833 --> 08:55.033
if Aunt Doreen can do
all that with a gouty gam,

08:55.066 --> 08:57.100
you sure as shit
can line dance in Letterkenny.

08:57.133 --> 08:58.700
I guess you're right.

08:58.733 --> 09:00.933
If Aunt Doreen can do it
with a shitty stick,

09:00.966 --> 09:03.800
then I can probably get up
on stage at the talent show

09:03.833 --> 09:06.600

Last winter, Gail got me Lasik,
but it didn't take, so...

20:04.000 --> 20:05.033
I didn't say it was your fault.

20:05.066 --> 20:06.566
