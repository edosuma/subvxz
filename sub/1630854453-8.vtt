<i>Previously on
The L Word: Generation Q...</i>

00:05.422 --> 00:06.923
You hit it?

00:06.923 --> 00:08.758
<i>- My name's Carrie.
- I'm Misty.</i>

00:08.758 --> 00:09.676
<i>You like her.
- I sort of joined</i>

00:09.676 --> 00:11.428
<i>her bowling league.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:13.680
<i>Playing the long game.
I'll take it.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:16.141
<i>I like you. I guess I'm just
not, like, used to being chased.</i>

00:16.141 --> 00:18.184
<i>"Chased" is funny
'cause you know I don't run.</i>

00:18.184 --> 00:20.645
<i>Did you make that man
a chapbook? Are you in love?</i>

00:20.645 --> 00:22.188
<i>Let's just see
how tonight goes first.</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:23.481
<i>Hendrix. Steven Chavez.</i>

00:23.481 --> 00:24.816
Steven, this is Angie.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.026
<i>Sh-She's a student of mine.</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:27.485
What the fuck was that?!

00:27.485 --> 00:29.237
I want to see where this goes.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.197
<i>I don't think we can do that
while you're my student.</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:32.741
<i>He broke up with me.</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:33.825
Maribel, will you marry me?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.076
<i>I don't want to get married.</i>

00:35.076 --> 00:37.037
<i>I want to have a baby.</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:38.246
<i>I can't look at any more donors.</i>

00:38.246 --> 00:39.664
<i>Yeah, same.</i>

00:39.664 --> 00:41.541
<i>Hello.
- Hey. I'm so happy you came.</i>

00:41.541 --> 00:43.376
<i>There are a few people I
thought you could meet tonight.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:44.878
<i>Oh, right.
This is a work thing.</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:45.920
<i>Are you at all serious
about your career?</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:47.213
Look, I got you.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.716
Messy is good sometimes.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.843
<i>Fuck you, Shane.
-</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.094
I ruined it with Tess.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.512
No, she loves you.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.556
<i>We need to go to a meeting.
-</i>

00:56.556 --> 00:58.475
<i>We're heading to Vegas
right now. Tess's mom died.</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:00.393
I'm in a bit of a situation.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.811
<i>Are you around?
- Come on in.</i>

01:01.811 --> 01:03.813
I can just call Sophie.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.523
<i>It's just gonna make it
worse, it's gonna last longer.</i>

01:05.523 --> 01:07.233
<i>I don't have
a good relationship with my mom.</i>

01:07.233 --> 01:08.693
<i>You've been really good
to me, so, thank you.</i>

01:08.693 --> 01:10.361
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

01:11.654 --> 01:12.906
<i>I don't find trouble</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:15.575
<i>Yeah, trouble finds me</i>

01:15.575 --> 01:17.744
<i>"TFW" by Rayelle</i>

01:17.744 --> 01:20.246
<i>La-la, la-la-la, la-la</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:22.540
<i>That's what I need,
that's what I love</i>

01:22.540 --> 01:24.751
<i>- That's what I want, yeah
- That feel when</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:26.336
<i>Jump in my feet...</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:27.378
<i>Maybe the turkey trot
is a mistake.</i>

01:27.378 --> 01:28.755
I mean,

01:28.755 --> 01:30.548
<i>I wanted to show Misty
off to the firm,</i>

01:30.548 --> 01:32.092
<i>but maybe it's too soon? Oh,
look, you're not even listening.</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:33.968
<i>You're sexting Sophie, right?
- What? No.</i>

01:33.968 --> 01:35.929
<i>And no one says "sexting."</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:37.388
<i>No one?
- No.</i>

01:37.388 --> 01:38.890
<i>No one.
- Huh. Well,</i>

01:38.890 --> 01:41.059
<i>I could tell
by that stupid silly little grin</i>

01:41.059 --> 01:42.435
<i>you have on your face,</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.104
<i>that you were doing something
with her.</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:45.438
<i>Okay, could you?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

01:45.438 --> 01:46.564
<i>Or are you too busy
falling in love</i>

01:46.564 --> 01:47.941
<i>with Misty to notice anything?</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.109
<i>What the hell are you
talking about?</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:50.318
<i>Hmm.
- Why are you saying that</i>

01:50.318 --> 01:51.945
<i>so loud, too?
- Ooh.</i>

01:51.945 --> 01:53.279
<i>Let's just say
I'm not the only one</i>

01:53.279 --> 01:54.906
<i>with a stupid little grin
on my face.</i>

01:54.906 --> 01:57.242
<i>Touch√©. I'll admit it.
I do enjoy her company.</i>

01:57.242 --> 01:59.619
<i>Call it what you want.
I know what I know.</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:00.954
<i>You don't know anything.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:02.622
<i>You want to know something?
- Sure.</i>

02:02.622 --> 02:04.958
<i>Secret between you and me?
- Okay.</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:06.751
<i>We haven't had sex yet.</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:08.628
<i>What?
- Yeah.</i>

02:08.628 --> 02:11.297
<i>Wh...?
- You know I'm demisexual.</i>

02:11.297 --> 02:13.424
<i>That means
I have to feel emotionally close</i>

02:13.424 --> 02:14.634
<i>and safe
before I can move forward.</i>

02:14.634 --> 02:16.636
<i>The woman is running a 5K
with you.</i>

02:16.636 --> 02:18.388
<i>It feels like
we're-we're... we're there.</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:19.597
Hey, sorry, guys.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.141
<i>Shh.
- I saw a leaky handle,</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:22.642
<i>and I couldn't resist.
- Oh, okay. [chuckles]</i>

02:22.642 --> 02:25.145
Uh, you know what Finley did?

02:25.145 --> 02:26.563
<i>She made you
a really cool cup of coffee.</i>

02:26.563 --> 02:28.565
<i>You did?
- Yeah. Let's see what you think.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:30.024
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:31.359 --> 02:32.777
<i>Come on, tell me you like it.</i>

02:32.777 --> 02:34.320
<i>Oh, my yummy.
That is fucking good.</i>

02:34.320 --> 02:36.364
<i>Right? Told you.
- Yeah.</i>

02:36.364 --> 02:37.991
<i>You were right.
- I'm usually a tea person,</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:39.325
<i>but delicious,
uh, pumpkin... something?</i>

02:39.325 --> 02:40.869
<i>Pumpkin spice.
- Yeah.</i>

02:40.869 --> 02:41.953
<i>'Tis the season, baby.
- You're a wizard.</i>

02:41.953 --> 02:43.288
<i>That's so good.</i>

02:43.288 --> 02:44.831
<i>Listen, we better get going.
- Mm.</i>

02:44.831 --> 02:46.332
<i>My shoulder's acting up.
- Mm-hmm?</i>

02:46.332 --> 02:48.293
<i>I'm afraid
my calves are gonna seize.</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:49.961
<i>Okay.
- And I don't want to get</i>

02:49.961 --> 02:51.212
<i>a relapse of that stupid</i>

02:51.212 --> 02:52.505
<i>"plantar's flat-ee-itis"
or whatever.</i>

02:52.505 --> 02:54.174
What the hell?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.675
<i>Fasciitis.
-"Fasciitis"?</i>

02:55.675 --> 02:57.343
<i>Have a good race, ladies.
- All right.</i>

02:57.343 --> 02:59.220
<i>See you later.
- Save me some bird, some leg.</i>

02:59.220 --> 03:01.973
<i>Listen,
when we get to the turkey trot,</i>

03:01.973 --> 03:03.808
<i>if we happen to run
into a guy named Buck,</i>

03:03.808 --> 03:05.727
<i>ignore him, he's my boss.</i>

03:05.727 --> 03:07.437
<i>Buck?
- Buck.</i>

03:07.437 --> 03:08.980
<i>We have a full house
for Thanksgiving dinner</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:10.315
<i>here tonight.
- Yes.</i>

03:10.315 --> 03:11.357
<i>So, let's get the turkey
cooking, okay?</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:13.193
<i>Hey. I'm sorry about your mom.</i>

03:13.193 --> 03:14.986
I didn't think

03:14.986 --> 03:16.988
<i>you were coming back
till tomorrow.</i>

03:16.988 --> 03:19.532
<i>I know.
- How are you? Bad, huh?</i>

03:19.532 --> 03:22.452
<i>Ugh. You know.</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:24.037
<i>Still processing.</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
<i>You seen Shane yet?
- Um, no.</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:29.209
<i>I haven't even been home yet.</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:30.877
<i>What is that? Is...? Jesus.</i>

03:30.877 --> 03:32.712
<i>Is that...? Tess, is that her?</i>

03:32.712 --> 03:35.048
<i>Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:37.008
<i>I didn't know what
to do with her, so I thought,</i>

03:37.008 --> 03:39.552
<i>you know, next to the good booze
is a good place for now.</i>

03:39.552 --> 03:41.554
<i>I think that's a great place.</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:45.266
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna scatter them
at some point, I am.</i>

03:45.266 --> 03:47.685
<i>You know, if you need
the time off, or anything,</i>

03:47.685 --> 03:50.104
<i>you can do whatever you want.
I can...</i>

03:50.104 --> 03:52.899
<i>I have it.
- I know you do.</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:54.901
<i>But I just, um...</i>

03:54.901 --> 03:58.446
<i>I want to...
focus on... something.</i>

03:58.446 --> 04:01.241
<i>I just, you know, I...
I want to be here,</i>

04:01.241 --> 04:03.034
<i>doing something, anything.</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:05.912
<i>You just want to spend the day
with me. I get it.</i>

04:05.912 --> 04:07.830
You can be honest. I'm like

04:07.830 --> 04:09.582
<i>the perfect holiday companion.</i>

04:09.582 --> 04:11.042
<i>I know nothing about politics,</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:13.378
<i>and my table banter
is top notch.</i>

04:14.796 --> 04:16.256
<i>Okay, you caught me.
- Called it.</i>

04:16.256 --> 04:17.674
<i>I just want
to spend the day with you.</i>

04:17.674 --> 04:19.217
<i>Okay.
- Okay?</i>

04:19.217 --> 04:20.426
<i>I'm just gonna distract
the shit out of you</i>

04:20.426 --> 04:21.719
<i>with meaningless tasks.</i>

04:21.719 --> 04:22.845
<i>That... Please. Yes.</i>

04:22.845 --> 04:24.013
<i>Okay.
- Okay.</i>

04:24.013 --> 04:25.098
Okay, we got flowers.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.266
<i>We're gonna put these--</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:27.767
<i>thank you--
on every table.</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:29.686
<i>On every table?
- Yes. And then,</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:31.271
<i>I'll find something else
for you to do.</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:34.524
<i>Okay, well, look at you,
all in charge.</i>

04:34.524 --> 04:36.693
<i>Look at that.
- Top of the world,</i>

04:36.693 --> 04:39.570
<i>doing so well.
-</i>

04:39.570 --> 04:41.823
Happy Thanksgiving, Sarah.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.577
<i>Mom.</i>

04:46.577 --> 04:48.288
<i>Didn't see you comin'</i>

04:48.288 --> 04:50.123
<i>Oh, yeah,
didn't see you comin'</i>

04:50.123 --> 04:52.792
<i>Yeah, freefall that'll
take your breath</i>

04:52.792 --> 04:54.627
<i>Didn't see you comin'</i>

04:54.627 --> 04:57.130
<i>Oh, yeah,
didn't see you comin'</i>

04:57.130 --> 05:00.216
<i>Yeah, I bet you wanna know
what happens next</i>

05:00.216 --> 05:02.176
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

05:02.176 --> 05:04.053
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

05:04.053 --> 05:06.347
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

05:06.347 --> 05:08.266
I cannot wait for Thanksgiving.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.101
<i>Everybody's gonna be there.</i>

05:10.101 --> 05:14.022
<i>My granny, all my brothers,
my friends from home.</i>

05:14.022 --> 05:16.065
<i>Ooh-wee.
- And your girl?</i>

05:16.065 --> 05:17.859
<i>She's not my girl.</i>

05:17.859 --> 05:20.820
<i>But... yeah. Nobody misses
my granny's stuffing.</i>

05:20.820 --> 05:23.906
<i>She uses saltines
instead of bread.</i>

05:23.906 --> 05:25.742
<i>It sounds insane,
but it's legit.</i>

05:25.742 --> 05:27.243
<i>Saltines?</i>

05:27.243 --> 05:29.495
<i>Yup. Saltines.
- Yum.</i>

05:32.957 --> 05:34.417
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:38.838
<i>You make it hard to leave.</i>

05:38.838 --> 05:42.592
<i>Come save me,
you're driving me crazy</i>

05:42.592 --> 05:45.011
<i>'Cause I would die waiting</i>

05:45.011 --> 05:46.846
<i>For you...</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:51.184
<i>Mm. That's probably my Lyft.</i>

05:51.184 --> 05:52.602
<i>Oh, they can wait five minutes.</i>

05:52.602 --> 05:54.020
Five minutes.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.314
<i>Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Five minutes.</i>

05:56.314 --> 06:00.902
<i>You put your spell on me</i>

06:03.571 --> 06:06.991
<i>You put your spell on...</i>

06:06.991 --> 06:10.286
Okay.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.913
Oh.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.414
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

06:13.414 --> 06:14.957
<i>What's wrong?</i>

06:14.957 --> 06:17.543
My flight's been canceled.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.797
<i>Oh, no.
- Fuck. How am I gonna get home?</i>

06:20.797 --> 06:23.049
<i>I have the joy
of giving thanks to Lenore</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:25.176
<i>and her ex-husband tonight.
What are you up to?</i>

06:25.176 --> 06:28.346
<i>Well, Shane and I are going
to volunteer at the food bank.</i>

06:28.346 --> 06:30.139
<i>- That's right.
- Oh, look at you.</i>

06:30.139 --> 06:32.850
<i>Yeah, just two upright citizens
helping the community.</i>

06:32.850 --> 06:34.977
<i>Uh-huh. How's Tess?
Is she with you?</i>

06:34.977 --> 06:38.648
<i>Uh... no, no, she's not.
She's still in Vegas.</i>

06:38.648 --> 06:40.149
<i>No, you can't thaw out
the turkey in the microwave.</i>

06:40.149 --> 06:41.984
<i>But I think
she's gonna be back soon.</i>

06:41.984 --> 06:45.071
<i>Oh, okay. Well, just tell her
I'm thinking about her.</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:47.073
<i>I will.
- Okay. We got to go.</i>

06:47.073 --> 06:48.533
<i>Love you. Goodbye.
- Love you. Bye.</i>

06:48.533 --> 06:50.785
<i>Love you. Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

06:51.786 --> 06:53.454
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

06:54.956 --> 06:56.582
<i>Fuck. Oh, my God.</i>

06:56.582 --> 06:58.918
<i>What?
- It's someone I dated briefly.</i>

06:58.918 --> 07:01.003
<i>Got 'em looking at me
like, "Whoa"</i>

07:01.003 --> 07:02.296
<i>Which one?
- No, no, no. Oh, fuck.</i>

07:02.296 --> 07:04.048
<i>The guy.
Okay, I think we should go.</i>

07:04.048 --> 07:06.092
<i>The guy in the green?
- Come on, come on.</i>

07:06.092 --> 07:07.427
<i>Got 'em looking at me...</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:09.512
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

07:09.512 --> 07:11.264
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

07:11.264 --> 07:13.474
<i>Do you want me
to ask her to leave?</i>

07:13.474 --> 07:14.934
<i>I don't... [sighs]</i>

07:14.934 --> 07:16.477
<i>Let me move these things
so we can sit.</i>

07:16.477 --> 07:17.937
<i>Did she really come
all this way to see me?</i>

07:17.937 --> 07:21.524
<i>I mean,
it does seem like that, yeah.</i>

07:21.524 --> 07:23.943
<i>It does, right?
Like, it-it-it...</i>

07:23.943 --> 07:25.695
<i>That just cannot be true.</i>

07:25.695 --> 07:27.655
<i>Something else has
to be going on.</i>

07:27.655 --> 07:28.948
<i>Okay.
- Look, I know that you have</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:30.408
<i>a complicated relationship
with her.</i>

07:30.408 --> 07:31.993
<i>Yeah, understatement
of the fucking year.</i>

07:31.993 --> 07:34.829
<i>So, if you want me
to ask her to leave, I will.</i>

07:34.829 --> 07:37.790
<i>But? Is there a "but" coming?</i>

07:37.790 --> 07:40.460
<i>But if there's anything
I've learned recently,</i>

07:40.460 --> 07:42.211
<i>it's that
we really just don't know</i>

07:42.211 --> 07:44.297
<i>how much time
we have with anyone.</i>

07:44.297 --> 07:47.717
And she is here.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.927
<i>Like, she's right there.
- I know.</i>

07:49.927 --> 07:51.637
<i>soft, gentle music</i>

07:53.139 --> 07:56.309
<i>Okay. I can do this.</i>

07:56.309 --> 07:57.894
<i>You can.</i>

07:57.894 --> 07:59.479
<i>Oh, sweet Tess.
- Yeah.</i>

07:59.479 --> 08:01.731
<i>I can totally do this.
- Okay.</i>

08:01.731 --> 08:03.357
<i>And listen, like, I'm...
Anything you need.</i>

08:03.357 --> 08:05.318
I'm right here.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.986
<i>You just ask. Anything.</i>

08:06.986 --> 08:10.114
<i>Okay, I will. Okay, I just...</i>

08:10.114 --> 08:11.657
<i>I just think I need a minute.</i>

08:11.657 --> 08:13.284
<i>Go. Go outside, get some air.</i>

08:13.284 --> 08:14.702
<i>Okay.
- To-- Yeah. Okay.</i>

08:14.702 --> 08:16.120
<i>I'll be here.
- Okay. Sorry.</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:18.206
<i>Okay. Yeah.
- Sorry.</i>

<i>"The Breaks"
by Sarah Proctor</i>

08:29.675 --> 08:32.803
<i>Maybe I'll sink
to the bottom</i>

08:32.803 --> 08:36.599
<i>Maybe I'll float
on the waves</i>

08:36.599 --> 08:38.976
<i>Maybe I'll empty the bottle</i>

08:40.394 --> 08:44.482
<i>Maybe I'll be okay</i>

08:44.482 --> 08:47.360
<i>I see hope in the shallows</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:50.196
<i>But the tide,
it pulls me away</i>

08:51.781 --> 08:55.493
<i>And if I go down
with the devil</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:58.371
<i>Well,
that would be her mistake</i>

08:58.371 --> 09:00.164
<i>Waiting for the breaks</i>

09:00.164 --> 09:03.960
<i>I'm stuck in the middle

09:03.960 --> 09:06.629
<i>I'm lost in the current,
need a break</i>

09:06.629 --> 09:10.424
<i>I'm stuck in the middle</i>

09:13.094 --> 09:15.388
<i>Waiting for the breaks...
- Hey.</i>

09:15.388 --> 09:17.056
<i>Hi. I'm sorry. [chuckles]</i>

09:17.056 --> 09:19.559
<i>Uh, now's not a good time.
My whole family's here.</i>

09:19.559 --> 09:22.061
<i>My mom's cooking, it's... crazy.</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:24.063
<i>I didn't know who else to call.</i>

09:24.063 --> 09:25.982
<i>I-I know, I'm sorry.</i>

09:25.982 --> 09:27.483
<i>I know it's Thanksgiving.</i>

09:27.483 --> 09:30.903
<i>I, um, really
wouldn't have called.</i>

09:30.903 --> 09:32.738
Um...

09:32.738 --> 09:35.700
<i>Uh, is... is everything okay?
Is something wrong?</i>

09:35.700 --> 09:38.494
<i>Need a break,
I'm stuck in the middle...</i>

09:38.494 --> 09:39.704
<i>My mom showed up.</i>

09:39.704 --> 09:42.707
O-Oh.

09:42.707 --> 09:46.627
<i>Could you come here? Please?</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:48.129
Okay, guys, well,

09:48.129 --> 09:49.589
<i>it looks like
we're spending Thanksgiving</i>

09:49.589 --> 09:50.881
<i>at Dana's with Finley
and her mom. Okay?</i>

09:50.881 --> 09:52.508
Mijita, no.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.594
<i>I'm not spending Thanksgiving
at a bar, okay?</i>

09:54.594 --> 09:56.387
<i>No, yo tampoco. Uh-uh.
- We're supposed</i>

09:56.387 --> 09:59.098
<i>to have it here with,
hmm, our family, maybe?</i>

09:59.098 --> 10:00.766
<i>Hey.
- Finley needs us, okay?</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:02.768
And what-what we are going to--

10:02.768 --> 10:04.604
<i>supposed to do
with all this food?</i>

10:04.604 --> 10:06.105
<i>We are gonna pack it
up, and we're gonna have it</i>

10:06.105 --> 10:08.274
<i>for leftovers tomorrow, okay?
- No.</i>

10:08.274 --> 10:09.400
<i>Ay.
- Okay? You know--</i>

10:09.400 --> 10:10.568
<i>Why are you even talking to her?</i>

10:10.568 --> 10:11.944
<i>I thought you guys broke up.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:13.029
<i>We're friends.</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:14.280
<i>That's what friends do.</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:15.615
Oh, really?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.782
<i>I've never had
a friend like that.</i>

10:16.782 --> 10:18.576
Okay, smart-ass.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.286
<i>I bet you 20 bucks that
they are getting back together.</i>

10:20.286 --> 10:23.205
<i>I'll take that bet.
- No! You know what?</i>

10:23.205 --> 10:25.416
<i>No, I'm not spending
Thanksgiving with her</i>

10:25.416 --> 10:27.460
<i>or her terrible fucking mother.</i>

10:27.460 --> 10:28.961
<i>Yes, you are.
- No.</i>

10:28.961 --> 10:30.838
<i>And you know why?
Because you're my beautiful,</i>

10:30.838 --> 10:33.466
<i>- gorgeous, loving...
-¬°Ay, Dios m√≠o!</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:35.635
<i>Ooh.
- ...so-good-to-people sister.</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:37.470
<i>Queen of this Earth!</i>

10:37.470 --> 10:38.971
<i>That's good.
- Because you know</i>

10:38.971 --> 10:41.515
<i>it's the right thing
to do, okay?</i>

10:41.515 --> 10:43.976
<i>Not everyone has
a family like ours.</i>

10:43.976 --> 10:45.770
<i>You're fucking fortunate.
- Ay-ay-ay.</i>

10:45.770 --> 10:47.521
<i>You heard that speech?
- You know she's right.</i>

10:47.521 --> 10:49.440
<i>She's right.
- Little guilt?</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:51.817
She is. Look, I'll go.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.279
<i>Okay? I love Finley.
But I think I need something</i>

10:55.279 --> 10:57.531
<i>to take the edge off,
'cause holidays are a lot.</i>

10:57.531 --> 10:59.158
<i>So--
- Oh, hold on.</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:01.661
<i>Uh, here you go. Gummies.
- Ooh.</i>

11:01.661 --> 11:03.913
<i>Uh, how many should I take?</i>

11:03.913 --> 11:06.123
<i>Uh, maybe, uh...
- Eh, ni√±a...</i>

11:06.123 --> 11:08.292
<i>Why don't you just start
with one?</i>

11:08.292 --> 11:11.754
<i>Oh, what about...?
All right, well...</i>

11:11.754 --> 11:14.090
<i>All right, everybody! Come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

11:14.090 --> 11:15.508
<i>Put 'em down. Let's go.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.842
<i>All right, I'm coming.
- Let's go.</i>

11:16.842 --> 11:17.843
<i>I'm coming.

<i>Okay. Ah, ah...</i>

11:19.428 --> 11:21.138

<i>¬øY √©l lo sabe?</i>

11:35.194 --> 11:37.071
<i>No, he doesn't know yet.

Hey. Are you guys coming?

11:38.155 --> 11:39.699
<i>Or-- are you ready?</i>

<i>Lo perd√≠, mijita.</i>

11:56.716 --> 11:57.842
<i>Pues, no se donde quedo.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.093
Move your ass! Let's go!

11:59.093 --> 12:01.053
<i>- Wait a second!
- Ay, ah√≠ vamos.</i>

12:01.053 --> 12:02.346

12:03.347 --> 12:04.348
<i>Look. Mira.</i>

- Ya vamos.</i>

12:19.989 --> 12:23.242

We're taking the mashed potato.</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:25.244
<i>Let's go.

<i>Ooh! There is a flight
through Denver this afternoon.</i>

12:35.212 --> 12:36.881
<i>I'll take it.
- Oh. Nope, sorry.</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:38.924
<i>That one's delayed
until tomorrow, too.</i>

12:38.924 --> 12:41.594
<i>Oh.
- What if I fly to Chicago</i>

12:41.594 --> 12:43.095
<i>and drive from there?</i>

12:43.095 --> 12:44.638
<i>Well, Chicago's
in the eye of the storm.</i>

12:44.638 --> 12:46.724
<i>Or New York? Or Boston?
- Hello?</i>

12:46.724 --> 12:48.267
<i>Yeah, ooh, yeah.</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:50.936
<i>Hello? Hi. Yes.
-</i>

12:50.936 --> 12:53.230
<i>I need a flight to Cleveland
as soon as possible.</i>

12:53.230 --> 12:55.399
<i>Or Atlanta.</i>

12:57.610 --> 12:59.278
<i>Oh.</i>

13:01.155 --> 13:05.075
<i>Oh.</i>

13:05.075 --> 13:06.869
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

13:06.869 --> 13:09.747
<i>Yeah, I understand. Thanks.</i>

13:09.747 --> 13:13.459
<i>Still no flights, but
I'll just go to the airport,</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:15.753
<i>and I'll get on standby
for something.</i>

13:15.753 --> 13:18.422
<i>I am not letting you
spend Thanksgiving at LAX.</i>

13:18.422 --> 13:21.592
<i>I hear you, but I can't
just not see my family.</i>

13:21.592 --> 13:24.386
<i>I've never missed a holiday
or anything. At all.</i>

13:25.888 --> 13:27.765
<i>Oh!</i>

13:27.765 --> 13:29.433
<i>I knew I had some.
-</i>

13:29.433 --> 13:32.394
<i>I had the flu
a couple months ago.</i>

13:32.394 --> 13:34.438
<i>Bought this big-ass box.</i>

13:34.438 --> 13:36.607
<i>We can make the stuffing.</i>

13:36.607 --> 13:38.150
<i>What about your friends?
- Apparently,</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:39.735
<i>they're all at dinner
with a bigot,</i>

13:39.735 --> 13:42.655
<i>so, I am good to miss that.</i>

13:42.655 --> 13:44.448
<i>Stay.</i>

13:44.448 --> 13:46.492
<i>I want you to.</i>

13:46.492 --> 13:48.327
<i>slow, gentle music</i>

13:48.327 --> 13:49.995
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

13:49.995 --> 13:51.622
<i>Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

13:51.622 --> 13:52.748
<i>Yeah, yeah.
- Yes!</i>

13:54.708 --> 13:57.044
<i>So, there's no menu?</i>

13:57.044 --> 14:01.423
<i>Uh, no. There usually is, but
today we did a whole preorder...</i>

14:01.423 --> 14:02.925
<i>I see.
- ...thing? Yeah, you should have</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:04.552
<i>got it when
you made your reservation.</i>

14:04.552 --> 14:07.263
<i>Hmm.
- Which, actually, was when?</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:09.974
<i>About a week or so ago?
- Okay.</i>

14:09.974 --> 14:11.767
<i>You could have, maybe, told me.</i>

14:11.767 --> 14:12.893
<i>I tried to tell you.</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:14.395
<i>Well, I know you called.</i>

14:14.395 --> 14:16.564
<i>I did call, didn't I?
And what did you do?</i>

14:16.564 --> 14:17.982
<i>Well, I--
- You didn't pick up.</i>

14:17.982 --> 14:19.650
<i>slow, melancholy music</i>

14:19.650 --> 14:21.110
<i>Well, no. But--
- And how was that</i>

14:21.110 --> 14:23.112
<i>supposed to make me feel?</i>

14:23.112 --> 14:27.199
<i>I'm sorry.
I-I-I should have answered.</i>

14:27.199 --> 14:29.034
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:35.040
<i>Sorry. Um... I do have
some friends coming.</i>

14:35.040 --> 14:37.293
<i>Fun.
- Yeah.</i>

14:37.293 --> 14:39.461
<i>Um, so, I'm just gonna...</i>

14:39.461 --> 14:41.005
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:42.381
<i>I-I have
to work a little bit but--</i>

14:42.381 --> 14:44.967
<i>Go ahead. Yeah, you go.
- Okay.</i>

14:47.177 --> 14:49.722
Okay, turkey trotters, let's go!

14:49.722 --> 14:52.391
<i>So close to the finish line!</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:57.187
<i>Oh, boy.
- Yeah.</i>

14:57.187 --> 14:58.689
<i>Yeah.
- Here we go.</i>

14:58.689 --> 15:00.608
<i>Oh, Jesus. He must be--
- An aggressive turkey.</i>

15:00.608 --> 15:01.859
<i>Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, Buck.</i>

15:01.859 --> 15:03.110
<i>So glad you made it.
- Yeah.</i>

15:03.110 --> 15:04.361
<i>I wouldn't miss the turkey trot.</i>

15:04.361 --> 15:07.573
<i>Oh.
You must be Tina.</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:09.491
<i>No, Buck. Tina left me.</i>

15:09.491 --> 15:12.202
<i>We discussed that, remember?
- My mistake.</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:13.913
<i>Yeah. This is Misty,
my girlfriend.</i>

15:13.913 --> 15:15.748
<i>Oh. Your girlfriend?</i>

15:15.748 --> 15:17.207
<i>Oh, God.
- Yup, girlfriend.</i>

15:17.207 --> 15:19.084
<i>Oh, good for you. Moving on.</i>

15:19.084 --> 15:21.003
<i>I guess so.
- Well,</i>

15:21.003 --> 15:22.963
<i>thanks again for coming, okay?
- Sure.</i>

15:22.963 --> 15:24.715
<i>Last one to the finish
buys lunch on Monday?</i>

15:24.715 --> 15:27.593
<i>All right.
- So, don't dawdle!</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:29.595
<i>I-I'd love to tell you
that he's not always like that,</i>

15:29.595 --> 15:31.430
<i>but he is.
- Uh-huh.</i>

15:31.430 --> 15:33.015
<i>Why don't we just slow down
and let him get ahead of us?</i>

15:33.015 --> 15:35.559
<i>Um, no, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna pick it up.</i>

15:35.559 --> 15:37.061
<i>What?
- Yeah, I got to go.</i>

15:37.061 --> 15:38.437
<i>I'm gonna pick it up.
- Seriously?</i>

15:38.437 --> 15:40.689
<i>Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, geez.</i>

15:40.689 --> 15:44.610
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:46.779
<i>All right.</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:49.365
<i>This isn't gonna last long.</i>

15:49.365 --> 15:51.200
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.535
Hey, hi.

15:53.535 --> 15:56.121
<i>Um, Mom, so, uh,
this is Micah...</i>

15:56.121 --> 15:57.957
<i>Hi.
- ...and Sophie</i>

15:57.957 --> 15:59.458
<i>and her sister, Maribel,</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:00.960
<i>and their mom and grandma.</i>

16:00.960 --> 16:02.336
<i>And Aunt Virginia.
- I would hug you, but--</i>

16:02.336 --> 16:03.504
<i>Did you bring those
from home? Oh.</i>

16:03.504 --> 16:05.506
<i>Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

16:05.506 --> 16:07.508
<i>Mind helping me out here?
- Oh, yeah, sure.</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:10.094
<i>Thank you so much, Jane.
- Hi.</i>

16:10.094 --> 16:13.597
<i>So, so nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.</i>

16:13.597 --> 16:16.767
<i>Oh, no. What happened here?</i>

16:16.767 --> 16:19.186
<i>Oh.
- Mom.</i>

16:19.186 --> 16:22.356
<i>What? It'll grow back.
- Sure will.</i>

16:22.356 --> 16:24.733
<i>Okay. Why don't you just go sit
on the end over there?</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:26.735
<i>Okay.
- Okay. Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

16:26.735 --> 16:29.655
<i>Mm-hmm. Okay.
- It's fine.</i>

16:31.615 --> 16:33.325
<i>I want to talk to you
for one second, okay?</i>

16:33.325 --> 16:36.078
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.
Uh, Mom, I got to work.</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:37.663
<i>Just... easy.</i>

16:37.663 --> 16:40.499
<i>Sarah, just be nice
to your mother.</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:43.836
<i>Can you believe that?
Silly. Honestly.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:45.254
Yeah, of course.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.589
<i>Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. Here.
- Oh. Oh.</i>

16:47.589 --> 16:49.675
<i>Take one of these.
- I'm so hungry.</i>

16:49.675 --> 16:50.926
<i>I've only got one left.
I'm sorry.</i>

16:50.926 --> 16:52.094
<i>I'll circle back.
- Thank you.</i>

16:52.094 --> 16:53.762
Happy Thanksgiving.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.514
<i>Mmm. I want a bite.</i>

16:55.514 --> 16:59.685
<i>Is it "puffed pastry"?
Or "puft pastry," with a "T"?</i>

16:59.685 --> 17:03.814
<i>Like, "puft," "puft pastry"?</i>

17:03.814 --> 17:05.607
<i>Puff, puft.</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:11.363
<i>If you made us come here</i>

17:11.363 --> 17:13.991
<i>just so you can sleep
with Finley, I swear to God--</i>

17:13.991 --> 17:17.786
<i>Oh, my God. Just, shh.
We're just friends, okay?</i>

17:17.786 --> 17:19.580
<i>Calm down. Calm it down.</i>

17:19.580 --> 17:21.248
<i>And how many gummies
did he take?</i>

17:21.248 --> 17:23.292
<i>Three too many.
-</i>

17:23.292 --> 17:26.378
<i>Oh, my God. I could eat this
as a meal. What is it?</i>

17:26.378 --> 17:28.172
<i>It's sour cream, honey.</i>

17:28.172 --> 17:30.424
<i>It's good.</i>

17:32.176 --> 17:34.219
<i>Oh, God. I can't
believe she brought her own</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:35.679
<i>fucking mashed potatoes.
Do you know what?</i>

17:35.679 --> 17:37.222
<i>I'm gonna go get them.
-</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:38.348
<i>No, no, no.
- No?</i>

17:38.348 --> 17:39.850
<i>Leave 'em there.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
<i>Why?
- Because. Because</i>

17:41.560 --> 17:42.895
<i>they're the only home-cooked
food I get to have today.</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.354
All right. Geez, I didn't know

17:44.354 --> 17:46.315
<i>you liked them so much.
- Oh, shit.</i>

17:46.315 --> 17:48.484
<i>Well, I do,
and I want them to stay, okay?</i>

17:50.903 --> 17:54.573
<i>Well, we met, uh, at Marcus's
show in August, September.</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:57.576
<i>Oh, right. That's the guy
you were kissing out by the car.</i>

17:57.576 --> 17:59.078
<i>Yeah. Exactly, so--
- Huh?</i>

17:59.078 --> 18:00.746
<i>Wow. That, like,
feels like forever ago</i>

18:00.746 --> 18:02.831
<i>in, like, a weird way but, um...</i>

18:02.831 --> 18:07.086
<i>We were barely together.
I don't know. I just...</i>

18:07.086 --> 18:08.921
<i>I thought we were.</i>

18:09.963 --> 18:11.965
<i>Whatever. I'm not...</i>

18:11.965 --> 18:14.259
<i>I'm not... I'm not upset.
I just wish</i>

18:14.259 --> 18:16.720
<i>that he didn't waste my time.</i>

18:16.720 --> 18:18.680
<i>I guess.</i>

18:18.680 --> 18:20.808
<i>Talk to me, Ange.
What's going on?</i>

18:23.811 --> 18:27.106
<i>Basically,
the timing wasn't right.</i>

18:27.106 --> 18:30.526
<i>And so... he said
that he would wait</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:32.653
<i>until the end
of the semester for me.</i>

18:32.653 --> 18:35.697
<i>But... he was definitely
with that girl, right?</i>

18:35.697 --> 18:37.741
<i>No, not necessarily.</i>

18:37.741 --> 18:39.201
<i>You don't know
who that person was.</i>

18:39.201 --> 18:42.162
<i>I just wish that I could,
like, fast-forward</i>

18:42.162 --> 18:44.790
<i>to what my moms have,
or you and Tess.</i>

18:46.208 --> 18:49.086
Angie...

18:49.086 --> 18:51.130
<i>you're 18.</i>

18:52.089 --> 18:53.882
<i>Remember that.</i>

18:53.882 --> 18:55.884
<i>I promise you,
it is gonna happen.</i>

18:55.884 --> 18:58.387
<i>But even when it does...</i>

18:58.387 --> 19:00.639
<i>it's gonna take work.</i>

19:02.432 --> 19:04.184
<i>Everyone has problems.</i>

19:04.184 --> 19:05.894
<i>Sure, but it would be nice
to, like,</i>

19:05.894 --> 19:07.563
<i>have the big ones ironed out.</i>

19:07.563 --> 19:09.648
<i>So...</i>

19:13.902 --> 19:16.655
<i>Tess... isn't in Vegas.</i>

19:18.115 --> 19:19.783
<i>What do you mean?</i>

19:19.783 --> 19:22.369
<i>Finished up the stuff
with her mom last week,</i>

19:22.369 --> 19:24.413
<i>but she's here now.</i>

19:24.413 --> 19:28.917
<i>I just haven't spoken
to her because...</i>

19:28.917 --> 19:32.546
<i>she needs space from me,
which I understand.</i>

19:32.546 --> 19:35.340
<i>Oh.
- Nobody's perfect.</i>

19:35.340 --> 19:36.967
<i>Oh, you do, right?
- Yes!</i>

19:36.967 --> 19:40.470
<i>So, my roommates and I,
we have Scrabble nights.</i>

19:40.470 --> 19:42.639
<i>Fuck.</i>

19:42.639 --> 19:44.433
<i>Just, down.
- What?</i>

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
<i>What?
- Down.</i>

19:49.438 --> 19:50.814
<i>No.
- Oh.</i>

19:50.814 --> 19:52.107
<i>He has his hand on her back.
- Okay.</i>

19:52.107 --> 19:55.485
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

19:55.485 --> 19:58.864
<i>Take a deep breath. Okay?</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:01.700
<i>What's the plan?
- We live here now.</i>

20:05.370 --> 20:07.289
<i>No, give it back.</i>

20:10.000 --> 20:12.544
<i>Oh. I need to try these.
- Oh, no!</i>

20:21.178 --> 20:22.596
Oh, my God.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.809
<i>Oh, it's a tradition,
eat it like this.</i>

20:27.809 --> 20:29.561
<i>Yeah, y...</i>

20:29.561 --> 20:31.396
<i>despierta los sabores.</i>

20:31.396 --> 20:33.273
<i>Wakes up the flavors.</i>

20:33.273 --> 20:35.567
<i>Oh. Uh, gracias.</i>

20:35.567 --> 20:36.944
<i>De nada.</i>

20:40.405 --> 20:41.865
<i>How we doing?</i>

20:41.865 --> 20:44.243
Okay, so,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.745
<i>Suarez tradition.</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:49.706
<i>We are going to all write down</i>

20:49.706 --> 20:53.252
<i>what we're most thankful for,
okay?</i>

20:53.252 --> 20:56.713
<i>And then, we're all gonna
read it out loud,</i>

20:56.713 --> 20:59.925
<i>and we... guess who wrote them.</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:01.176
<i>Thanks, bud.
- Yeah, you're welcome.</i>

21:01.176 --> 21:02.594
All right.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.473
<i>Okay, well, I am thankful
for my daughter Sarah.</i>

21:07.474 --> 21:08.892
<i>Okay.</i>

21:08.892 --> 21:11.603
<i>Definitely never
heard you say that before, but--</i>

21:11.603 --> 21:14.106
<i>If you ever came home,
I could have told you.</i>

21:15.148 --> 21:17.234
Uh, well, you know,

21:17.234 --> 21:18.777
<i>my mom says that all the time,</i>

21:18.777 --> 21:20.195
<i>and she lives
just down the block.</i>

21:20.195 --> 21:22.364
<i>That's true.
- Well, it's not just me.</i>

21:22.364 --> 21:24.074
<i>Her father misses her, too.</i>

21:24.074 --> 21:27.661
<i>Okay, well, if that's true,
then why isn't he here?</i>

21:29.663 --> 21:31.707
<i>Oh, my God. Is he...?</i>

21:31.707 --> 21:33.750
<i>Is that why you're here?
Is he not okay?</i>

21:33.750 --> 21:35.877
<i>No, no. He's... he's fine.</i>

21:35.877 --> 21:37.462
<i>He's fine.</i>

21:39.756 --> 21:42.009
<i>But I am leaving him.</i>

21:42.009 --> 21:45.429
<i>I'm sorry. What?
- I've been</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:48.348
<i>unhappy for quite some time,
but you know that.</i>

21:48.348 --> 21:51.643
<i>I absolutely did not know that.
- Come on, Sarah.</i>

21:51.643 --> 21:53.645
<i>No. Mom, I'm serious.
What do you mean?</i>

21:53.645 --> 21:55.314
<i>We got married young, okay?</i>

21:55.314 --> 21:57.149
<i>I-I felt
like something was missing,</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:58.859
<i>like I was trapped
in the marriage.</i>

21:58.859 --> 22:00.610
<i>What are you even talking about?</i>

22:00.610 --> 22:01.737
<i>Hey. Don't take
that tone with me.</i>

22:01.737 --> 22:03.113
<i>Hey!
- What-what tone?</i>

22:03.113 --> 22:04.323
<i>What is my tone?</i>

22:04.323 --> 22:05.449
<i>Like I'm an idiot.</i>

22:05.449 --> 22:07.034
<i>I don't think you're an idiot.</i>

22:07.034 --> 22:08.910
<i>I just... I'm...
- I just thought maybe</i>

22:08.910 --> 22:10.996
<i>you'd be able to understand.
- Understand?</i>

22:10.996 --> 22:12.622
<i>How could I...?</i>

22:12.622 --> 22:13.999
<i>You're the only person I know</i>

22:13.999 --> 22:15.959
<i>who ever left Kansas City
and did anything.</i>

22:15.959 --> 22:18.253
<i>You created your own life.</i>

22:18.253 --> 22:21.757
<i>I came here because
I thought I...</i>

22:26.178 --> 22:27.846
<i>Never mind.</i>

22:27.846 --> 22:30.640
<i>I would love some salad
if you don't mind.</i>

22:30.640 --> 22:32.642
<i>slow, melancholy music</i>

22:35.812 --> 22:39.024
<i>Thank you. [clears throat]</i>

22:48.909 --> 22:50.535
She always does this.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.746
<i>She just... she knows
the exact thing to say</i>

22:52.746 --> 22:55.165
<i>to send me into a freefall.
It's like...</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:59.002
<i>Why can't anything be
fucking simple?</i>

22:59.002 --> 23:01.213
<i>I'm so sorry, Finn.
- It's okay.</i>

23:01.213 --> 23:03.340
<i>It's okay.
I just... I still don't get</i>

23:03.340 --> 23:06.301
<i>what she wants me to do.
Like, like, I don't know.</i>

23:06.301 --> 23:08.136
<i>Give her a guidebook
to leaving my dad?</i>

23:08.136 --> 23:10.097
<i>Who I like more than her?
- You don't</i>

23:10.097 --> 23:11.765
<i>owe her anything.</i>

23:11.765 --> 23:15.018
<i>No, I know but I--
- You can't control her.</i>

23:15.018 --> 23:18.021
<i>That's the main thing, right?
You can only control yourself.</i>

23:18.021 --> 23:22.567
<i>Right.
- So, what do you want?</i>

23:22.567 --> 23:24.903
<i>Um...</i>

23:24.903 --> 23:27.739
<i>I don't know what I want.</i>

23:27.739 --> 23:29.908
<i>I...</i>

23:29.908 --> 23:32.077
<i>I could make my amends?</i>

23:32.077 --> 23:34.079
<i>Take back control a little?</i>

23:34.079 --> 23:36.164
<i>I--
- Yes. No, that's... Yes.</i>

23:36.164 --> 23:37.749
<i>You could.
- I-I don't know.</i>

23:37.749 --> 23:39.918
<i>I never thought I'd do it
in person, but she's here.</i>

23:39.918 --> 23:42.421
<i>She-she showed up, right?
- I don't know, Finn.</i>

23:42.421 --> 23:45.257
<i>I... I-I think this might
not be the right time.</i>

23:45.257 --> 23:47.259
<i>Or it could be the perfect time.</i>

23:47.259 --> 23:49.553
<i>Okay, this could be
very healing for you.</i>

23:49.553 --> 23:53.432
<i>Right. Right, I'm...</i>

23:53.432 --> 23:55.559
<i>Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna do it.</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:56.893
<i>Okay.
- I'm an adult.</i>

23:56.893 --> 23:58.437
<i>I mean, it's my life.
Oh, my God.</i>

23:58.437 --> 23:59.813
<i>What the fuck am I gonna say?</i>

23:59.813 --> 24:01.523
<i>I can't just--
- Um, sit at my desk,</i>

24:01.523 --> 24:03.567
<i>take some time, write
something down. You don't have</i>

24:03.567 --> 24:05.318
<i>to do it on the fly. Okay?
- Right.</i>

24:05.318 --> 24:06.653
<i>We will go,
give you some privacy.</i>

24:06.653 --> 24:08.071
<i>You just--
- Okay.</i>

24:08.071 --> 24:09.531
<i>Okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:10.615
<i>Okay.
- Um--</i>

24:10.615 --> 24:12.033
<i>I'm-I'm here for you.</i>

24:12.033 --> 24:14.286
<i>Okay.
- Okay.</i>

24:17.747 --> 24:21.334
<i>You know, I'm just trying to
make sure she doesn't get hurt.</i>

24:21.334 --> 24:24.588
<i>Well, you don't have
to worry about her anymore.</i>

24:24.588 --> 24:26.798
<i>She's a big girl.</i>

24:40.520 --> 24:42.731
<i>All right, I can't watch you
torture yourself.</i>

24:42.731 --> 24:44.816
<i>I'm gonna get you out of here.</i>

24:44.816 --> 24:46.902
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.
They're gonna see us.</i>

24:46.902 --> 24:49.905
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey,
do you trust me?</i>

24:49.905 --> 24:52.741
<i>Yes.
- Okay.</i>

24:52.741 --> 24:55.160
<i>Wait. What about the hungry?</i>

24:55.160 --> 24:58.663
I'll write 'em a check. Come on.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.790
<i>light, whimsical music</i>

25:13.094 --> 25:15.555
Hey.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.890
<i>Can I steal one of those?</i>

25:16.890 --> 25:18.058
<i>They're for charity.</i>

25:18.058 --> 25:19.518
My bad.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.353
<i>Sorry.
- Excuse me.</i>

25:28.193 --> 25:31.947
<i>Misty?! Hey, Misty!</i>

25:31.947 --> 25:33.365
<i>Yeah.
- Come on, man!</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:34.991
<i>Oh, God.
- Wait up!</i>

25:34.991 --> 25:37.702
<i>Oh, um--
- Oh, geez.</i>

25:37.702 --> 25:39.037
<i>Oh, God. I got to work out more.</i>

25:39.037 --> 25:40.539
<i>Oh, my God.
- You know?</i>

25:40.539 --> 25:42.123
<i>Mm-hmm.
- I haven't worked out since...</i>

25:42.123 --> 25:44.626
<i>Oh, ever since
that Jane Fonda tape got stuck</i>

25:44.626 --> 25:46.211
<i>in my VCR, you know?
- Yeah.</i>

25:46.211 --> 25:48.338

25:48.338 --> 25:50.131
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

25:50.131 --> 25:52.884
<i>I'm sorry about, uh, saying
that you were my girlfriend.</i>

25:52.884 --> 25:55.887
<i>I... happened to catch
your facial expression, and...</i>

25:55.887 --> 25:58.640
<i>My boss, you know, he always
puts me on the spot.</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:00.141
<i>I mean, I feel like an idiot</i>

26:00.141 --> 26:02.185
<i>every time he asks me
even mundane things.</i>

26:02.185 --> 26:03.853
<i>You know, he says,
"What'd you do on the weekend?"</i>

26:03.853 --> 26:05.397
<i>And I have to make something up.</i>

26:05.397 --> 26:06.898
<i>What am I gonna tell him?</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:08.733
<i>I stayed home
and watched 90 Day Fianc√©</i>

26:08.733 --> 26:10.569
<i>and, uh, cooked a frozen pizza?
- I'm just...</i>

26:10.569 --> 26:12.988
<i>Listen, I'm just... I'm really
embarrassed right now.</i>

26:12.988 --> 26:14.990
<i>Oh, no. Did I ruin it?
- Yeah, no. I just, I, uh...</i>

26:14.990 --> 26:17.492
<i>I really have
to find a bathroom.</i>

26:17.492 --> 26:18.910
<i>Oh, right now?
- Yeah.</i>

26:23.873 --> 26:25.166
<i>Okay, I'll get you there.
- Ooh. Okay.</i>

I'm good in an emergency.</i>

<i>Come on, Misty. Come on.
- Oh, my God.</i>

26:31.256 --> 26:32.591
<i>Oh, God.
- I can run.</i>

26:32.591 --> 26:33.925
<i>For real?
- Yeah.</i>

26:33.925 --> 26:35.552
<i>For real?
- Yes. [laughs]</i>

26:35.552 --> 26:39.764
<i>I mean, look, look, okay.
So, family's hard.</i>

26:39.764 --> 26:41.600
<i>Mm.

- Hmm.</i>

26:45.270 --> 26:47.272
<i>Do you have a Brie?</i>

26:50.567 --> 26:54.029
<i>Okay, I sort of have a Brie,
sort of.</i>

26:54.029 --> 26:55.780
<i>Sophie?
- No!</i>

26:55.780 --> 26:58.241
<i>Mm.
- No, no, no, no, no. No.</i>

26:58.241 --> 26:59.784
<i>Uh...</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:04.998
<i>I went to daycare
with this girl named Roxy.</i>

27:04.998 --> 27:07.751
<i>That's so cute.
- Yeah, so cute.</i>

27:09.961 --> 27:11.921
<i>She and I were, like, best
friends throughout grade school,</i>

27:11.921 --> 27:15.800
<i>and then we sort of, like, made
out in high school, you know?</i>

27:15.800 --> 27:17.969
<i>Where is she at now?
- In Costa Rica.</i>

27:17.969 --> 27:19.971
<i>Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

27:19.971 --> 27:21.681
<i>So, not the love of your life?</i>

27:21.681 --> 27:23.975
<i>I mean... I don't know.</i>

27:23.975 --> 27:27.354
<i>She's just, like, the
flightiest person I've ever met.</i>

27:27.354 --> 27:29.731
<i>Like, couldn't even stay in town
long enough to...</i>

27:29.731 --> 27:34.361
<i>commit to an animal,
let alone another person.</i>

27:34.361 --> 27:35.737
<i>But she's like family.</i>

27:35.737 --> 27:38.156
<i>Yeah. Sounds like it.</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:42.202
<i>Yeah,
our moms were best friends.</i>

27:42.202 --> 27:44.454
<i>Oh, are they still close?</i>

27:44.454 --> 27:46.122
<i>Uh...</i>

27:46.122 --> 27:51.002
<i>Uh, my mom died of cancer
when I was ten.</i>

27:51.002 --> 27:53.338
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

27:53.338 --> 27:55.674
<i>And my dad's in prison.</i>

27:55.674 --> 27:57.967
<i>Fuck.
- Cheers. [laughs]</i>

27:57.967 --> 27:59.636
<i>Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

27:59.636 --> 28:02.013
<i>Oof.
- Yeah. It's sort of tough</i>

28:02.013 --> 28:05.141
<i>to work into, like,
an easy conversation, you know?</i>

28:05.141 --> 28:06.601
<i>Yeah, no shit.</i>

28:06.601 --> 28:08.770
<i>Um... [smacks lips]</i>

28:10.230 --> 28:14.359
<i>Yeah. Man, I miss her.</i>

28:14.359 --> 28:16.528
<i>She could cook.</i>

28:16.528 --> 28:19.739
<i>Like... [sighs]</i>

28:19.739 --> 28:23.034
<i>We didn't have
super big Thanksgivings,</i>

28:23.034 --> 28:26.705

28:29.457 --> 28:31.042
<i>Kind of like this.</i>

28:34.671 --> 28:38.049
<i>Ours are, like,
a hundred times louder.</i>

28:38.049 --> 28:39.759
<i>Mm.</i>

28:39.759 --> 28:42.887
<i>But this is really nice.</i>

28:42.887 --> 28:45.223
<i>Loud?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

28:45.223 --> 28:47.434
<i>Louder. You want loud?</i>

28:48.935 --> 28:50.478
<i>Yes?</i>

28:50.478 --> 28:51.980
<i>We can do loud.</i>

28:51.980 --> 28:53.648
<i>Come on.
- Oh, okay.</i>

28:53.648 --> 28:55.233

on a little adventure.</i>

<i>Why do you have
to say shit like that?</i>

36:36.819 --> 36:38.112
<i>Yeah. Kind of brutal, Mom.</i>

36:38.112 --> 36:40.823
<i>Oh, excuse me. Who are you?</i>

36:40.823 --> 36:43.117
<i>I'm Carrie. I've been
filling in, in your absence.</i>

36:54.545 --> 36:56.005
<i>That is not what happened.
- It is.</i>

36:56.005 --> 36:57.632
<i>It is what happened.</i>

36:57.632 --> 36:59.467

and you told me to get out.</i>

36:59.467 --> 37:00.718

that dry-cleaned right away.</i>

37:25.660 --> 37:27.078

37:27.078 --> 37:29.038
You know what?

37:29.038 --> 37:30.915

44:44.848 --> 44:47.434
<i>How much longer
are you gonna be?!</i>

44:47.434 --> 44:50.104
<i>Please hurry!
Can you please fucking hurry?!</i>

44:50.104 --> 44:51.689
Okay. Okay.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.359
<i>To breathe...</i>

44:55.359 --> 44:57.611
I love you, Mama.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.489
<i>And try to live</i>

45:00.489 --> 45:05.494
<i>'Cause I don't know
what I'd do, my dear</i>

45:05.494 --> 45:09.748
<i>And now she lays
in her bed, unconscious</i>

45:09.748 --> 45:14.545
<i>And now you talk about
how she had problems</i>

45:14.545 --> 45:19.591
<i>Can't you see that we're
the ones who caused them</i>

45:22.344 --> 45:24.388
<i>She doesn't see the world</i>
