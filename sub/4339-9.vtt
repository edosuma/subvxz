WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.936
<i> - Previously on</i> The Strain...
- Nikki!

00:04.938 --> 00:07.271
I'm so glad you're alive.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.273
- You wanted to come back here
and get your clothes--

00:09.275 --> 00:10.607
- Why don't we both
get our things?

00:10.609 --> 00:12.475
It's so much safer there.

00:12.477 --> 00:15.778
- Let's start with the train.
I did see Barnes. He saw me.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.447
We got into a fight and I'm
the one that threw him off.

00:18.449 --> 00:21.483
And all I managed to do is get
four people killed!

00:21.485 --> 00:24.285
- Four? Barnes...
- Rob,

00:24.287 --> 00:26.820
the man that was
sent to kill us...

00:26.822 --> 00:29.455
- Who was the fourth?
- Leigh Thomas.

00:29.457 --> 00:31.990
- I see.

00:31.992 --> 00:34.792
<i>- We are going to give you back</i>
<i> your streets, the shops,</i>

00:34.794 --> 00:36.894
<i> your restaurants, all of it.</i>
<i> But I'm not going</i>

00:36.896 --> 00:39.229
<i> to lie to you; it's going to</i>
<i> take sacrifice.</i>

00:39.231 --> 00:41.297
- Smart. Red Hook's surrounded

00:41.299 --> 00:43.699
by water on three sides.
It's manageable.

00:46.236 --> 00:48.302
- Please, honey, let me in.
- Zack?

00:48.304 --> 00:50.804
No! DON'T!
- You're wrong, Dad.

00:50.806 --> 00:52.872
She needs our help.

00:54.809 --> 00:57.809
(snarling)
(bullets ricocheting)

00:59.979 --> 01:02.179
(shrieking)

01:02.181 --> 01:05.248
- No! Get off of him!
Leave him alone!

01:05.250 --> 01:08.050
- Zack?

01:22.232 --> 01:24.598
(distant sirens)

01:26.535 --> 01:29.502
- You start your day early,
Captain Messina.

01:29.504 --> 01:32.004
It's dangerous
to be out before dawn.

01:32.006 --> 01:34.039
- Who the hell are you?

01:34.041 --> 01:36.841
- A night owl, like yourself.

01:36.843 --> 01:39.510
I would like to hire you

01:39.512 --> 01:42.546
to ferry a private party
across the river

01:42.548 --> 01:45.048
into Red Hook tonight,

01:45.050 --> 01:47.016
immediately after sundown.

01:47.018 --> 01:49.618
- Ah, sorry, I don't do private
charters. Now if you don't mind,

01:49.620 --> 01:51.853
I've got stuff to do.
- I promise

01:51.855 --> 01:54.422
to make it worth your while.

01:54.424 --> 01:57.758
Open it.

01:59.762 --> 02:02.094
This is only half.

02:05.032 --> 02:07.198
You get the other half

02:07.200 --> 02:09.200
when we arrive
safely in Red Hook.

02:09.202 --> 02:11.402
Even at the current rate
of inflation,

02:11.404 --> 02:13.570
I'm sure you'll agree

02:13.572 --> 02:15.471
the sum's more than fair.

02:15.473 --> 02:18.874
- For this, you can
buy the boat.

02:18.876 --> 02:22.210
- No, I need you to guide us
safely to the other side.

02:22.212 --> 02:25.513
- Who's "us"?

02:29.585 --> 02:31.885
- 20 passengers exactly.

02:31.887 --> 02:34.754
- And after I get you
across to Red Hook?

02:34.756 --> 02:37.556
- You drive home
and count your money.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.391
- Red Hook has a lot
of security now.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.995
- Your point being?

02:44.997 --> 02:48.398
- They might not let us dock.
- I'm confident

02:48.400 --> 02:50.967
we can overcome
their resistance.

03:00.344 --> 03:04.012
(snorting and moaning)

03:12.188 --> 03:14.320
(chirping and clicking)

03:15.690 --> 03:17.690
- Now, now.

03:17.692 --> 03:20.492
These things happen.

03:20.494 --> 03:24.361
- (distorted): I've come
so close now.

03:24.363 --> 03:27.030
- This is not a measure
of failure.

03:27.032 --> 03:30.266
- Hmm...

03:30.268 --> 03:33.868
- She has replaced me.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.470
- Ah, Dr. Martinez.

03:36.472 --> 03:39.372
She is insignificant.

03:39.374 --> 03:42.441
These thoughts are a holdover
from your former life.

03:42.443 --> 03:46.311
She's nothing. You will
show her that in due time.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.880
- Why do I still feel pain?

03:48.882 --> 03:52.116
- It took a few years
for pain to subside.

03:52.118 --> 03:54.118
Be patient.

03:54.120 --> 03:59.122
- Hmm...
- He belongs with you.

03:59.124 --> 04:01.190
She's behaving

04:01.192 --> 04:03.725
as if the boy's hers.

04:03.727 --> 04:05.793
They are tenacious,

04:05.795 --> 04:09.163
but you are relentless.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.565
We will return.

04:14.536 --> 04:17.803
- How?
- I have made a plan.

04:25.378 --> 04:27.544
It is time for them

04:27.546 --> 04:29.945
to see our true power.

04:32.149 --> 04:35.316
Now, prepare your face
as best you can.

04:46.195 --> 04:48.161
(growling and purring)

04:50.331 --> 04:53.231
(theme music playing)

06:03.602 --> 06:06.235
- Alright. I checked all the
window grates, no loose bolts.

06:06.237 --> 06:08.237
Place is secure as long as we
don't--

06:08.239 --> 06:10.239
- No one does anything stupid
like open the door.

06:10.241 --> 06:13.242
- That creature manipulated you.
It's not your fault.

06:13.244 --> 06:15.677
- It retains all
your mother's memories,

06:15.679 --> 06:18.179
so it's easy to simulate.
- OK,

06:18.181 --> 06:20.447
I get it!

06:20.449 --> 06:22.282
Can we just not talk
about this right now?

06:22.284 --> 06:25.985
- I'm afraid we must.
The Master now knows we're here.

06:25.987 --> 06:29.121
- Because he can see through
Kelly's eyes, Zack.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.123
- They will come for us again.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.625
It may be 2 of them,
it may be 200,

06:33.627 --> 06:35.627
but they will come.
We must be prepared

06:35.629 --> 06:37.629
to defend this place.
- I've got a better idea.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.431
Why don't we get some backup.
- Eph is right.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.101
We should go tell Justine.
She's got cops, guns.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.703
She needs to know that strigoi
got into Red Hook.

06:46.705 --> 06:49.105
- No, we should stay here.
Eichorst will come for me.

06:49.107 --> 06:51.640
I know it. We have a chance
to finish him.

06:51.642 --> 06:54.309
- And we will. But we need

06:54.311 --> 06:57.945
more firepower,
and Faraldo's got it.

07:01.317 --> 07:05.052
- Shall we?
- Fine.

07:14.462 --> 07:17.229
- Do you know how
to use that thing?

07:17.231 --> 07:18.730
- Simple enough.

07:18.732 --> 07:21.365
- Where did you get it again?

07:21.367 --> 07:23.967
- From the guy I operated on
in the boat repair shop.

07:23.969 --> 07:26.235
- Oh... That's right.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.804
- I'm going to head over

07:28.806 --> 07:33.174
to Nikki's apartment
and check up on Dutch.

07:33.176 --> 07:35.976
- Atta boy.
- No quitters here, Doc.

07:35.978 --> 07:38.211
I'll meet you back
at Faraldo's headquarters.

07:38.213 --> 07:40.646
- You need a bodyguard?

07:40.648 --> 07:43.482
- I just might.

07:48.188 --> 07:51.255
- You stay by me
at all times.

07:51.257 --> 07:54.825
- Don't worry, I will.

07:54.827 --> 07:57.727
- If we're going, let's go
while it's still light.

08:05.936 --> 08:07.001
- Oh, whoa!

08:10.172 --> 08:12.172
- What?

08:12.174 --> 08:14.174
- You look so gay
using that tool.

08:14.176 --> 08:17.277
- Don't know what
you're talking about.

08:17.279 --> 08:20.279
(laughing)
Thanks.

08:22.216 --> 08:25.183
- So you going to tell me about
the phone call with your Mom?

08:25.185 --> 08:28.519
- She, um,

08:28.521 --> 08:30.787
wants me to move
back in with her.

08:30.789 --> 08:33.389
- Yeah. Thought so.

08:33.391 --> 08:36.191
She said a lot
of mean things about me.

08:36.193 --> 08:38.226
- Some of them true?

08:38.228 --> 08:42.395
- All of them, actually.

08:42.397 --> 08:46.131
What she doesn't know
is how I feel about you.

08:48.068 --> 08:50.301
(knocking on door)

08:55.373 --> 08:58.240
- It's Fet and Nora.

08:58.242 --> 09:00.976
- There you are.
- Hey. Come on in.

09:00.978 --> 09:03.111
- I've been trying to call.

09:05.048 --> 09:08.449
- How you feeling?
- So much better. Thank you.

09:12.054 --> 09:14.254
(passing siren)
- We had some uninvited guests

09:14.256 --> 09:17.890
last night. Kelly Goodweather
came after Zack.

09:17.892 --> 09:20.893
She and some spider kids
trashed my apartment.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.895
Everyone's OK,

09:22.897 --> 09:26.732
but I just wanted you to know
that Red Hook's not clear.

09:26.734 --> 09:30.268
It's just, uh, old man thinks
they'll come back, so...

09:30.270 --> 09:33.070
we're headed off
to Faraldo's headquarters.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.007
You should come, too.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.577
- But they're not after us.
- They came to my apartment.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.745
Who knows how
that mother found us.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.849
- Safety in numbers, right?

09:47.851 --> 09:51.285
- You should go if you want.

09:51.287 --> 09:53.687
- Yeah, well,
we'll talk about it.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.891
- I'll wait outside.

09:59.893 --> 10:01.893
Be safe, you two.

10:01.895 --> 10:04.662
- Yeah.
(sniffing)

10:11.870 --> 10:13.870
- You OK?

10:13.872 --> 10:17.039
- Yeah. Yeah, I just want
to get this done

10:17.041 --> 10:19.274
before it gets dark.

10:19.276 --> 10:22.644
I'll talk to her, alright?
Maybe we'll meet up later.

10:22.646 --> 10:25.413
- Nice job
on the windows, there.

10:25.415 --> 10:28.282
- It's not bad, right?

10:33.422 --> 10:36.389
(light kiss)

10:36.391 --> 10:39.792
Bye.

10:46.934 --> 10:49.567
- So, this book...

10:49.569 --> 10:51.602
- Ephraim, if you're
going to tell me

10:51.604 --> 10:55.639
how ridiculous my pursuit of
the<i> Lumen</i> is, save your breath.

10:55.641 --> 10:58.775
- But what else will we talk
about? No, no, I get it.

10:58.777 --> 11:01.577
I'm not giving up
my bioweapon either.

11:01.579 --> 11:04.279
- It's an exercise
in futility.

11:04.281 --> 11:07.015
The Master can always create
more strigoi.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.150
- I'll kill 'em as fast
as he can make 'em,

11:09.152 --> 11:11.152
and when they report back to
him, hopefully they'll

11:11.154 --> 11:15.022
kill him, too.

11:15.024 --> 11:17.858
- Something changed for you
in Washington, DC.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.293
- Yeah, the rules changed.

11:20.295 --> 11:24.363
- I see. I'm guessing
the rifle you're carrying

11:24.365 --> 11:26.665
is not meant
only for strigoi.

11:29.870 --> 11:32.837
- No, it's not.

11:32.839 --> 11:35.506
- Remaining human
at all costs

11:35.508 --> 11:38.609
is very important, even when
dealing with murderers.

11:38.611 --> 11:40.611
- Is that your bit

11:40.613 --> 11:42.613
of grandfatherly advice
for the day?

11:42.615 --> 11:44.982
- Merely a warning
from someone

11:44.984 --> 11:47.451
who has lived
among monsters.

11:58.730 --> 12:01.464
- (man): Checkpoint B
is all clear.

12:01.466 --> 12:03.466
- You see how we're
protected here.

12:03.468 --> 12:05.801
This is our main checkpoint.
These others spaced along here

12:05.803 --> 12:07.969
cut off the rest
of Brooklyn from Red Hook.

12:07.971 --> 12:10.638
Those UV lamps
scare off those stingers

12:10.640 --> 12:13.307
like roaches
when the kitchen light comes on.

12:13.309 --> 12:16.576
- And I imagine
the waterfront helps.

12:16.578 --> 12:18.578
- That's our edge. Now that
we've established a beachhead

12:18.580 --> 12:21.914
here, I want to push inland,
take back more of Brooklyn.

12:21.916 --> 12:25.416
- I was thinking we might try
a bolder strategic move.

12:25.418 --> 12:28.152
- Such as?

12:28.154 --> 12:30.654
- Manhattan. Specifically,

12:30.656 --> 12:32.822
the Upper East Side.
Still some of the most

12:32.824 --> 12:34.924
valuable real estate
in the city.

12:34.926 --> 12:37.192
- Yeah, where all your rich
asshole buddies live in their

12:37.194 --> 12:40.028
worthless townhouses.
- They're still very powerful,

12:40.030 --> 12:43.698
Justine. With contacts
not only here,

12:43.700 --> 12:46.901
but in Albany, DC.
They can still be

12:46.903 --> 12:49.003
very helpful to us.
- We agreed

12:49.005 --> 12:51.005
I do this my way,
and I don't think

12:51.007 --> 12:52.272
that's my best move
right now.

12:52.274 --> 12:53.673
- Mr. Mayor!
Sir, this is important.

12:53.675 --> 12:55.274
- Who is this guy?
- Councilwoman Faraldo,

12:55.276 --> 12:57.376
I worked with
Nora Martinez at the CDC!

12:57.378 --> 13:00.846
- Hey! Get his ass out of here!
- I believe you know my son,

13:00.848 --> 13:02.747
Zack?
- Yes, I do.

13:02.749 --> 13:06.283
- His mother--she's turned. She
got into Red Hook last night.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.619
She attacked us. She was made up
like an uninfected person.

13:09.621 --> 13:12.054
- I thought you told me
Red Hook was secure.

13:12.056 --> 13:14.022
- It is.
- It is not!

13:14.024 --> 13:18.026
They'll attack again. In greater
numbers. Probably tonight.

13:18.028 --> 13:20.528
- Who the hell is this guy?
- You must listen!

13:20.530 --> 13:23.397
The Master saw through
her eyes.

13:23.399 --> 13:26.233
He knows where we all are.

13:26.235 --> 13:29.703
- What're you talking about?
- You think you've succeeded

13:29.705 --> 13:31.538
but you have no idea
what you're facing!

13:31.540 --> 13:32.805
- Hey, that's enough of that!

13:32.807 --> 13:34.373
- The point is,
they're adapting.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.574
They're finding new ways
through the checkpoint.

13:35.576 --> 13:36.975
- Got it.
Thanks for the heads-up,

13:36.977 --> 13:38.643
but we need to get back
to our meeting here.

13:38.645 --> 13:40.544
- Alright. Take 'em outside.
Outside, everyone.

13:40.546 --> 13:43.613
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get 'em out of here!

13:43.615 --> 13:46.716
(hissing and snarling)

13:57.895 --> 14:00.795
- I've done my part.
You're in Red Hook.

14:06.268 --> 14:08.334
- Pay the man.

14:11.639 --> 14:13.805
- Thank you.

14:13.807 --> 14:15.973
You've earned a gratuity.

14:17.743 --> 14:20.009
(hissing)
(groaning and choking)

14:36.260 --> 14:38.960
- Ah! Done.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.128
That's good, isn't it?

14:41.130 --> 14:43.430
- Did Fet teach you
how to do that?

14:43.432 --> 14:46.933
- Yeah.
- Do you love him?

14:46.935 --> 14:50.102
- Yes.

14:54.707 --> 14:57.274
- Did you steal my money?
- No.

14:57.276 --> 15:01.111
But I did throw your laptop
into the Gowanus Canal.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.780
- Why would you do that?
- So much dark shit

15:03.782 --> 15:05.782
seemed to emanate from it.
- Oh, God, here we go.

15:05.784 --> 15:07.550
The judgements begin.

15:07.552 --> 15:10.519
- I don't judge you.
I ask questions.

15:10.521 --> 15:13.388
- OK. I have a few questions.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.790
Can you tell me your bullshit
timeline again?

15:15.792 --> 15:18.726
- What do you mean?
- I mean there are pieces

15:18.728 --> 15:20.861
missing everywhere.
- Dude, I'm not the liar here.

15:20.863 --> 15:23.964
- No, no, no. Come on. You say
that you went back to our place.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.132
You know, after you ran away
and left me for dead?

15:26.134 --> 15:29.068
And then you waited there but
did nothing to try and find me.

15:29.070 --> 15:31.570
And then you stayed with that
douche bag, Ron, for three days.

15:31.572 --> 15:33.572
And then what?
- I told you.

15:33.574 --> 15:35.574
- Tell me again.
- What are you doing?

15:35.576 --> 15:38.143
This is ridiculous.
- Oh, because we're talking

15:38.145 --> 15:40.145
about your behavior for once,
and not mine!

15:40.147 --> 15:43.148
God, you are always on such a
moral high horse.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.150
You know what? This, this is why

15:45.152 --> 15:47.152
you and I together
will never work.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.654
Somewhere, somewhere buried

15:49.656 --> 15:53.090
way in the back of me,
was this sensation

15:53.092 --> 15:55.425
that we had
unfinished business.

15:55.427 --> 15:58.528
And I couldn't kill that thought
not until I believed that you

15:58.530 --> 16:01.364
were gone for good,
and what a relief that was!

16:01.366 --> 16:04.333
I should've known that you would
rise up from the dead.

16:04.335 --> 16:06.368
You'd just show up again
and you'd dig yourself into me

16:06.370 --> 16:08.937
like some kind of tick.
- There is something

16:08.939 --> 16:11.539
seriously wrong with you.
- Yes! You!

16:11.541 --> 16:15.175
You are what's wrong with me!
I have always been in love

16:15.177 --> 16:18.344
with you, and it has never
made me happy!

16:37.064 --> 16:38.596
- Bob!

16:38.598 --> 16:40.230
- [Glenn, it's Jim.
Do you read me? Over.]

16:40.232 --> 16:42.899
- This is Glenn, over.
- [Got a situation on D Level.]

16:42.901 --> 16:45.134
[Need backup! Oh shit--]
(screeching and static)

16:45.136 --> 16:48.971
- Jim? Do you read?
- Let's go!

16:48.973 --> 16:54.209
Come on, let's check it out.
Hurry. (alarm ringing)

17:05.555 --> 17:07.620
- Good evening.

17:09.724 --> 17:13.392
I want you to turn the lights
off in Red Hook.

17:13.394 --> 17:16.094
- Maybe you shouldn't have
brought the Master

17:16.096 --> 17:17.895
into it -- just saying.

17:17.897 --> 17:19.730
- What are we doing here?
Let's go!

17:19.732 --> 17:21.598
- We're waiting for Nora and
Fet. They have a relationship

17:21.600 --> 17:24.434
with these people. Maybe Faraldo
will listen to them.

17:24.436 --> 17:26.135
- And if she doesn't?

17:26.137 --> 17:28.003
- Then I guess
we go back to Fet's.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.572
- Yup.
(loud boom)

17:30.574 --> 17:33.975
- (man): What's going on?
(indistinct shouting)

17:42.584 --> 17:44.917
- (Faraldo): They're out
all over.

17:44.919 --> 17:48.086
- We've seen this before.
- Seen what before?

17:48.088 --> 17:51.522
- Please, you must listen.
This is sabotage.

17:51.524 --> 17:54.925
The strigoi cut your power.
- The stri-- What?

17:54.927 --> 17:58.194
- The infected. It's Romanian.
It's a long story.

17:58.196 --> 18:00.529
- Now that you have no UV light,
prepare yourself

18:00.531 --> 18:03.365
for a coordinated
frontal assault.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.935
They will come!

18:06.937 --> 18:08.937
- Get the car.
We're getting out of here. Now.

18:08.939 --> 18:12.206
- You're leaving?
- You said it, Justine.

18:12.208 --> 18:15.042
The specifics of dealing with
all this are up to you.

18:18.714 --> 18:22.015
- I can't believe I voted
for that guy.

18:22.017 --> 18:26.318
- Alright. They want a fight,
they'll get one.

18:26.320 --> 18:30.154
Come on.
(men shouting)

18:30.156 --> 18:32.656
- OK? Come on.

18:32.658 --> 18:35.859
(sirens wailing)

18:35.861 --> 18:39.629
- (policeman): Hurry it up,
guys.

18:43.901 --> 18:46.167
- Alright! Let's get
a firing line, right up front!

18:46.169 --> 18:49.837
Move it!
- Give me a gun.

18:49.839 --> 18:53.207
- M-4 for the councilwoman!

18:53.209 --> 18:55.242
- You shot one of these
things before?

18:55.244 --> 18:57.244
- I'm a quick study.

18:57.246 --> 19:02.081
- Line up the sights, aim,
squeeze the trigger.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.317
- Wrap your hand around
the pistol grip, you flick off

19:05.319 --> 19:07.919
the safety. Get a stable body
position. Shoulder the stock.

19:07.921 --> 19:10.655
Put the red dot on their heads.
If they're moving fast,

19:10.657 --> 19:13.257
you lead them.
Squeeze gently, and repeat.

19:13.259 --> 19:15.259
- What he said.

19:15.261 --> 19:18.161
- Hey, Doc.
Just like old times, huh?

19:18.163 --> 19:22.564
- You find anything out there?
- No, nothing.

19:25.502 --> 19:27.335
- Let's get some flares
out there.

19:27.337 --> 19:28.736
- Yes, sir!

19:38.280 --> 19:40.446
- (man): Eyes out! Eyes out
for anything that moves!

19:40.448 --> 19:42.848
- Right there! 50 yards out!
- No more flares!

19:42.850 --> 19:44.549
(hissing and snarling)
- Here they come!

19:44.551 --> 19:47.451
- (commander): Hold your fire!
Wait for my signal!

19:47.453 --> 19:50.955
- (man): Safeties off!
(snarling)

19:50.957 --> 19:54.958
- Where the hell did they go?
- Why don't they come?

19:54.960 --> 19:57.794
- Be careful
what you wish for.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.363
- Hold your fire. Don't shoot.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.137
(hissing and snarling)
- Here they come! Get ready!

20:08.139 --> 20:11.740
Fire!
(bullets ricocheting)

20:14.978 --> 20:17.979
(shrieking)
Watch out, watch out!

20:17.981 --> 20:20.915
(indistinct shouting)

20:35.497 --> 20:37.530
Hold your fire!

20:37.532 --> 20:41.367
- Watch the gate!
(radio static)

20:41.369 --> 20:43.736
Check in! Everybody OK?

20:49.343 --> 20:52.577
- Why'd they do that?
- That was a probe.

20:52.579 --> 20:55.012
To test our defenses.

20:55.014 --> 20:58.115
They'll be back soon enough,
hordes of them.

20:58.117 --> 21:00.517
- Who's this guy again?

21:00.519 --> 21:02.752
- Somebody worth listening to.

21:04.856 --> 21:06.755
- We gotta put more people
on these barricades.

21:06.757 --> 21:08.857
- Thompson, I want you to call
in all the curfew cops

21:08.859 --> 21:11.392
from street patrol. Get them
down to the barricades ASAP.

21:11.394 --> 21:13.627
How many people we got
patrolling Red Hook?

21:13.629 --> 21:16.529
- (Thompson): [25 or so.]
- Get them all down here now.

21:16.531 --> 21:19.131
- You'll never hold this line
without UV.

21:19.133 --> 21:21.733
We gotta get to the power
station. Turn the juice back on.

21:21.735 --> 21:24.802
- We can't spare anyone now.
- We'll go.

21:24.804 --> 21:29.039
- Let's do it.
- Good hunting.

21:46.391 --> 21:48.557
- What the hell's he up to?

21:48.559 --> 21:50.825
- Hang tight.
I'll be right back.

21:50.827 --> 21:52.827
- Get back quick.

21:52.829 --> 21:54.929
- Where are you going?

21:54.931 --> 21:57.665
- We did our job.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.667
Warned them.
Now I have a personal matter

21:59.669 --> 22:01.669
to attend to.
- Eichorst.

22:01.671 --> 22:04.438
- This is my chance.
He'll be looking for me.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.440
- At Fet's.
- Yes.

22:06.442 --> 22:08.241
Most likely.
- You probably shouldn't

22:08.243 --> 22:10.243
take him on alone.
You do realize that, right?

22:10.245 --> 22:12.245
- Then come with me.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.947
- I will, but we have to get
the power back on. That's my

22:14.949 --> 22:17.182
first priority right now.
- Not mine. Others can do that.

22:17.184 --> 22:20.018
- You can't wait?
- You can't let them put

22:20.020 --> 22:23.755
the power on?
- Why are you so goddamned

22:23.757 --> 22:26.190
stubborn?
- You have your mission,

22:26.192 --> 22:28.926
I have mine.
- When I get the power situation

22:28.928 --> 22:31.261
under control, I'll come
meet you at Fet's, OK?

22:31.263 --> 22:34.764
- Best of luck, Doctor.

22:34.766 --> 22:38.667
(engine starting)

22:40.937 --> 22:44.204
(indistinct shouting and sirens)

23:12.300 --> 23:14.500
- Everything OK?

23:14.502 --> 23:17.135
- Power's out.

23:17.137 --> 23:20.371
All over, it looks like.
- Oh, great, a blackout

23:20.373 --> 23:23.574
on top of everything else.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.576
(gunshots and explosions)

23:25.578 --> 23:28.245
- Jesus, it's a war zone.

23:28.247 --> 23:30.313
- Something terrible
is happening.

23:30.315 --> 23:33.082
- Where are you going?

23:33.084 --> 23:35.417
- Gotta find out.
- Come on, you're not a cop.

23:35.419 --> 23:37.485
You'll get hurt.
It's too dangerous.

23:37.487 --> 23:39.820
- That gunfire is coming from
the checkpoint.

23:39.822 --> 23:43.156
I'll be back.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.994
(scoffing)

23:49.996 --> 23:53.997
Do not answer the door. Do not
leave the apartment. Take it.

23:53.999 --> 23:58.000
- This is crazy.

23:58.002 --> 24:01.269
You're just one girl.
What are you doing?

24:04.340 --> 24:07.908
- Thinking about other people.

24:12.047 --> 24:16.249
(loud squawking call)

24:20.521 --> 24:23.622
(screeches and groans)

24:23.624 --> 24:25.857
- You think they're calling
to each other?

24:25.859 --> 24:28.292
Signaling?
You know, like coyotes?

24:28.294 --> 24:30.760
- They're up to something.

24:33.030 --> 24:35.930
- We need to get up higher,
see what's going on out there.

24:48.043 --> 24:50.710
- Here.

24:50.712 --> 24:52.712
(snarling)

24:52.714 --> 24:55.815
- Jesus Christ, Frank!

24:55.817 --> 24:58.484
Look how many.

24:58.486 --> 25:01.286
Where the hell are they
all coming from?

25:04.257 --> 25:07.491
Do we have any more men?
Everybody's out on the streets,

25:07.493 --> 25:09.493
here and at the other
checkpoints.

25:09.495 --> 25:14.230
- This is suicide --
for all of us!

25:14.232 --> 25:18.566
These guys, they trusted me
with their lives.

25:18.568 --> 25:20.901
They believe in me.

25:20.903 --> 25:23.069
What have I done?

25:23.071 --> 25:26.005
- I have a police boat that can
take you back to Staten Island.

25:26.007 --> 25:29.742
- Is that what you're hearing?
That I want to leave?

25:29.744 --> 25:31.910
- Yeah. And that you
lost your balls.

25:33.914 --> 25:36.114
Those guys are down there

25:36.116 --> 25:38.349
because they belong there.
Got it?

25:40.086 --> 25:42.986
- Never hesitate again, because
that will get us killed.

25:47.358 --> 25:49.657
- You're right, Captain.

25:51.427 --> 25:55.862
Let's go.
- Lead the way.

25:59.834 --> 26:02.000
- (Fet): Let's pick up
the pace, huh?

26:02.002 --> 26:04.969
Wouldn't want to get
trapped in here.

26:04.971 --> 26:07.771
- Why didn't Mr. Setrakian
come in with us?

26:07.773 --> 26:09.773
- He's going back to Fet's
to get Eichorst.

26:09.775 --> 26:11.775
- That's not a good plan.

26:11.777 --> 26:14.444
(snarling)
(hissing)

26:16.548 --> 26:19.181
(firing again)
(hissing)

26:24.454 --> 26:27.288
- Come on.

26:42.638 --> 26:44.638
- Four down,

26:44.640 --> 26:47.540
who knows how many
more to go.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.767
(snarling)

27:16.769 --> 27:20.403
(screeching)

27:33.350 --> 27:35.416
- Mm. Zack.

27:42.390 --> 27:45.691
- Go. I'll take care
of the Jew.

27:45.693 --> 27:47.993
(croaking and snarling)

27:57.804 --> 28:00.538
-<i> People of Red Hook! This is</i>
<i> Justine Faraldo speaking.</i>

28:00.540 --> 28:05.208
We need your help! Red Hook is
under attack.

28:05.210 --> 28:08.711
I repeat, Red Hook
is under attack.

28:08.713 --> 28:11.046
When this plague began,
too many of us

28:11.048 --> 28:14.549
looked the other way.
We hid in our homes and we hoped

28:14.551 --> 28:16.984
that someone else would deal
with this problem.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.986
Now is the moment of truth.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.221
No one is coming to rescue us.

28:21.223 --> 28:24.824
If we want to survive,
we must do this ourselves.

28:24.826 --> 28:26.826
Join me

28:26.828 --> 28:29.094
and fight for all of us.

28:29.096 --> 28:32.397
Don't let these monsters
take this from us.

28:32.399 --> 28:35.333
People, today

28:35.335 --> 28:37.802
we fight or we die.

28:42.074 --> 28:44.974
- Alright, mad scientist.
Where's the "on" switch?

28:56.419 --> 28:59.787
- (man): Here they come!
- Shit, they're coming!

28:59.789 --> 29:01.855
Hold your fire until
they're right on top of us.

29:01.857 --> 29:05.325
Every bullet counts!
(roaring and screeching)

29:08.930 --> 29:11.764
- NOW! Light 'em up!
(bullets ricocheting)

29:11.766 --> 29:15.934
(screeching)

29:18.271 --> 29:21.205
- (man): MORE AMMO! Over here!
(indistinct shouting)

29:27.046 --> 29:29.513
- Fall back! FALL BACK!

29:34.786 --> 29:36.852
(screeching)

29:42.492 --> 29:47.394
- CS01...CS01 Main.

29:47.396 --> 29:49.396
- I think you're onto something.
- Alright. You've got a handle

29:49.398 --> 29:53.133
on this. I'm gonna go help the
Professor. You hold onto Zack.

29:53.135 --> 29:55.401
He'll be safer with you.
- Hey, Dad --

29:55.403 --> 29:58.036
Be careful.
- I will.

29:58.038 --> 30:00.738
Lock this door behind me.
- OK.

30:05.010 --> 30:07.176
(roaring and snarling)
- Follow me! Quickly!

30:07.178 --> 30:09.311
Citizens, to the barricade!

30:09.313 --> 30:12.213
Let's go!
(enthusiastic shouting)

30:14.083 --> 30:16.817
(grunting and shouting)

30:16.819 --> 30:19.820
- (man): LET'S GET 'EM!
(screeching)

30:19.822 --> 30:22.322
(screaming)

30:22.324 --> 30:25.558
(roaring)

30:30.664 --> 30:33.064
- There's got to be
something in here.

30:37.102 --> 30:40.370
(shouting and screeching)

30:49.813 --> 30:53.214
Good news is it looks as if
the high-side bus is still hot.

31:05.060 --> 31:09.695
- Shit...
(screeching)

31:25.345 --> 31:27.478
- What are you doing?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.913
(thumping and whirring)
- What's that sound?

31:29.915 --> 31:33.316
- The transformers. They're
coming back online.

31:33.318 --> 31:36.485
- These.

31:36.487 --> 31:39.187
- Here?
- Yeah.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.688
This one right here --
that one there.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.156
- This one?

31:42.158 --> 31:45.025
(whirring)
We did it.

31:45.027 --> 31:47.093
We did it!
We're back on the grid!

31:47.095 --> 31:49.995
(screeching and hissing)

31:53.266 --> 31:57.401
(screeching)

32:02.541 --> 32:06.009
- Son of a bitch!

32:06.011 --> 32:08.244
(strigoi screeching in pain)

32:15.019 --> 32:16.284
- Look at that!

32:16.286 --> 32:18.519
- You did great!
- We did it.

32:18.521 --> 32:21.088
- Hey.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.695
- (man): Good boy. Good boy.
- (woman): Honey, come here!

32:28.697 --> 32:30.697
- (second man): Come on!

32:30.699 --> 32:33.266
- (third man): It's over!

32:41.075 --> 32:44.976
- Power seems
to be holding steady.

32:44.978 --> 32:48.045
- NORA!
- Zack!

32:49.715 --> 32:51.247
- Got you. Got you.
(snarling)

32:51.249 --> 32:53.749
- We can't wait here
for her to get in.

32:53.751 --> 32:55.817
Draw her that way.
- Come on!

32:55.819 --> 32:58.219
(grunting)

33:06.929 --> 33:09.329
(hissing)
(bar dropping)

33:09.331 --> 33:11.964
(bullets ricocheting)

33:13.901 --> 33:17.969
Get down. Go down, now!
Stay there.

33:43.929 --> 33:46.162
(screech)
- AHH!

33:49.700 --> 33:52.834
SHIT!
(grunting)

34:03.146 --> 34:07.113
(grunting)
(choking snarl)

34:07.115 --> 34:10.116
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

34:10.118 --> 34:12.284
- Come on! We've gotta go!
Come on, sweetie.

34:12.286 --> 34:15.387
Come on! Come on!
(groaning)

34:24.797 --> 34:26.797
- Vasily Fet? Dr. Martinez?
Where are you?

34:26.799 --> 34:29.699
- SHOOT HER!
- Up there!

34:36.506 --> 34:39.640
(sighing)

34:48.483 --> 34:51.817
- A230385.

34:55.855 --> 34:58.488
I hope you're not hiding.

35:01.326 --> 35:04.894
That would be most
unworthy of you.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.500
Are you here?

35:45.701 --> 35:49.535
Miriam.

35:49.537 --> 35:53.105
What a lovely girl.

36:02.882 --> 36:04.948
(yelling)

36:08.553 --> 36:10.719
- (Setrakian): Looking for me?

36:10.721 --> 36:13.254
- Show yourself.
- Come out in the street!

36:13.256 --> 36:16.790
Let's finish this!

36:25.100 --> 36:28.568
- You have too much faith
in that sword.

36:28.570 --> 36:30.836
- If you're so eager
to drink me,

36:30.838 --> 36:33.905
why do you stand there
flapping your lips?

36:33.907 --> 36:37.775
- I want to savor this.

36:37.777 --> 36:39.809
(rifle shot)

36:42.580 --> 36:45.113
Goodweather!

36:45.115 --> 36:47.915
(shouting in another language)

36:47.917 --> 36:50.817
(rifle shot)
(grunting)

36:53.087 --> 36:55.120
- Ephraim!

36:55.122 --> 36:58.356
He's coming for you, Ephraim!

37:18.210 --> 37:20.210
- Goodweather.

37:20.212 --> 37:24.180
I'll wager that's not
your family's original name.

37:27.285 --> 37:30.319
What country did your people
immigrate from?

37:30.321 --> 37:33.055
Poland?

37:33.057 --> 37:34.990
Ukraine?

37:34.992 --> 37:37.459
Latvia?

37:37.461 --> 37:40.295
What was their original name?

37:43.632 --> 37:46.398
Goldstein?

37:48.802 --> 37:54.071
Gotlieb?
(clicking tongue)

37:57.309 --> 38:00.209
I can smell your sweat.

38:05.315 --> 38:09.483
Same stench as the old man's.

38:09.485 --> 38:12.552
Bitter.

38:12.554 --> 38:16.422
Brackish.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.557
Like the Dead Sea.

38:23.096 --> 38:25.096
That sound takes me back --

38:25.098 --> 38:28.899
the satisfying crack
of a Mauser K98.

38:33.004 --> 38:36.405
The Master allows me to share
Kelly's thoughts,

38:36.407 --> 38:39.674
her memories.

38:39.676 --> 38:42.343
I must say,

38:42.345 --> 38:45.778
many of those about you
are most unpleasant --

38:47.948 --> 38:51.349
your ambivalence about
having a child, for instance.

38:51.351 --> 38:54.552
How selfishly
you anguished over this,

38:54.554 --> 38:57.388
even after Kelly was pregnant.

38:57.390 --> 39:01.391
(shells dropping)
Her desire for Zack is strong.

39:01.393 --> 39:04.093
It will be very
interesting to see

39:04.095 --> 39:07.596
whose desire for your son is
stronger after I've turned you.

39:10.634 --> 39:13.701
Hm!

39:20.575 --> 39:22.575
Five shots.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.710
That's the one weakness
of this rifle --

39:24.712 --> 39:27.479
low capacity.
(shells dropping)

39:27.481 --> 39:29.881
(laughing)

39:29.883 --> 39:32.383
You're pathetic.

39:32.385 --> 39:35.552
(rifle shots)
(groaning)

39:35.554 --> 39:38.054
(gasping and snarling)

39:38.056 --> 39:41.457
(groaning)

40:11.088 --> 40:13.321
(slow dramatic music playing)

40:27.469 --> 40:30.703
- OK.

40:36.209 --> 40:38.776
(sighing)
You OK?

40:38.778 --> 40:40.778
- Yeah.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.447
- (Fet): Dutch!

40:43.449 --> 40:45.615
- Oh, God!

40:49.954 --> 40:52.554
Hey!
- Hey!

40:52.556 --> 40:56.623
- Hey, Zack. How did you maniacs
get the power back on, then?

40:56.625 --> 40:59.892
- By divine intervention.
- Not quite.

40:59.894 --> 41:02.027
She's a god damn genius.

41:04.131 --> 41:06.464
Hm...

41:06.466 --> 41:10.301
So you couldn't resist
the battle, huh?

41:10.303 --> 41:12.970
How did you do?
- It was pretty dicey.

41:12.972 --> 41:15.205
She saved my life.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.578
- Thanks.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.619
- (man): Alright, folks,
make a hole here, please.

41:30.621 --> 41:33.154
- Dad!

41:36.459 --> 41:39.126
- You're all in one piece, huh?
- Yeah.

41:39.128 --> 41:43.864
- People of Red Hook!

41:43.866 --> 41:47.100
This day will go down in history
as a turning point.

41:47.102 --> 41:50.436
Right? As the moment
that the people

41:50.438 --> 41:54.273
of New York came together and
stopped these bastards.

41:54.275 --> 41:57.709
(cheering and whooping)
- (Fet): Yeah!

42:04.617 --> 42:06.850
- People are gonna
remember this day --

42:06.852 --> 42:09.452
and you.

42:09.454 --> 42:12.521
- Me? We all did this, Frank.

42:25.969 --> 42:29.203
(theme music playing)
