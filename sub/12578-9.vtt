A raccoon, Ladybird, and Dale
are on the loose...

12:34.708 --> 12:36.505
and they all might be rabid.

12:36.610 --> 12:39.238
Peggy, you should stay here
in case Ladybird comes home.

12:39.346 --> 12:41.837
Not ''if,'' Hank. ''Whether or not.''

12:41.948 --> 12:44.940
The rest of us are going to cover
every inch of Arlen.

12:45.052 --> 12:48.453

13:24.057 --> 13:27.026
and l have been eating mushrooms
and moths.

13:27.327 --> 13:29.022
Mostly mushrooms.

13:29.129 --> 13:32.223
My rabies has taken a turn for the worse.

13:32.332 --> 13:34.630
l am starting to hallucinate.

13:34.735 --> 13:38.728
When l close my eyes, l can see
strange characters running around...

13:38.839 --> 13:43.139
chasing colorful geometric shapes
in a dark and infinite limbo.

13:43.643 --> 13:45.804

15:21.208 --> 15:25.076
when you call her name,

15:45.298 --> 15:47.528
straight up in the air, not at her.

16:00.881 --> 16:04.180
lf you're looking for that raccoon,
you're wasting your time.

16:04.284 --> 16:07.981
lt's probably two towns over by now,
eating some other kid's garbage.

16:08.088 --> 16:11.615
At least Bandit never ate my lunch
until after l'd thrown it out.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.822
That's what l'd call common courtesy.

16:15.028 --> 16:16.052
Yeah.

16:16.596 --> 16:19.258
l remember the time Ladybird jumped up
and ate your...

So did he.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.769
Damn it, Dale! You stupid--

17:37.877 --> 17:41.608
You will speak only
when l say you can speak.

17:41.715 --> 17:43.410
Remove the tape, Dale.

17:43.950 --> 17:46.316

all the blood out of your body.

Then l'm going to replace my blood
with your non-rabid blood...

all your knowledge of propane
and propane accessories.

18:11.678 --> 18:14.772
l think you might be eating
the wrong kind of mushrooms, Dale.

18:14.881 --> 18:19.045
l know what l'm doing. These mushrooms
have been keeping me alive.

18:19.352 --> 18:22.617
But what l don't know, Hank,
is how you can still talk...

18:22.722 --> 18:26.681
when there's a million bugs
squiggling in and out of your mouth.

18:26.793 --> 18:28.124
Yeah, l can talk.

18:28.428 --> 18:32.387

There is no way out of this.

18:57.123 --> 18:59.853
So, if l understand your plan...

19:00.026 --> 19:04.224
it is to replace your rabies blood
with my clean blood. ls that right?

-You told me.

19:08.368 --> 19:11.303

the sight of blood...

to hand me my pocketknife.
