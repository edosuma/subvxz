00:03.125 --> 00:06.125
(film reel rolling)

00:36.822 --> 00:39.489
(ominous music)

00:45.755 --> 00:49.088
(dramatic violin music)

02:56.674 --> 02:59.341
(ominous music)

03:31.686 --> 03:34.603
(mysterious music)

04:13.550 --> 04:15.679
- I will not look at it.

04:15.679 --> 04:18.203
It is nothing but a coat
hanging on the door.

04:21.170 --> 04:23.133
It's nothing but a coat
hanging on the door.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.430
I moved all the furniture to my liking,

04:32.430 --> 04:33.613
I made everything safe.

04:37.330 --> 04:38.680
Could draw the bed curtains.

04:40.270 --> 04:41.723
Then I'll not see what's there.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.750
Oh, come on, you're a grown man.

04:48.748 --> 04:51.498
(haunting music)

04:59.560 --> 05:01.700
Covering the Ipswich elections

05:03.640 --> 05:05.683
has provided some rich entertainment.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.503
A worse crowd of...

05:11.400 --> 05:12.830
A worse crowd of hypocrites

05:13.740 --> 05:14.890
I have never seen.

05:18.130 --> 05:21.570
I must think about that serial
I've promised Mr. Sloane.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.320
(mysterious music)

05:35.815 --> 05:39.482
It is nothing but a coat,
hanging on the door.

05:40.747 --> 05:43.439
But still you...

05:43.439 --> 05:44.272
look at me!

05:45.516 --> 05:50.516
(haunting music)
(heavy breathing)

05:52.830 --> 05:54.470
There.

05:54.470 --> 05:55.713
Now you cannot hurt me.

05:58.629 --> 06:00.560
I've had them move the bed, you see,

06:00.560 --> 06:02.960
so that I may sleep with
my head pointing north.

06:05.150 --> 06:08.193
So, all will be well.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.737
Ah, I should sleep.

06:16.737 --> 06:19.654
(mysterious music)

06:40.001 --> 06:42.668
(woman screams)

06:54.931 --> 06:57.181
(knocking)

07:07.640 --> 07:08.473
- My dear sir.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.693
I implore you, give me refuge.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.473
I have had a shock, sir.

07:16.128 --> 07:17.910
A most terrible shock.

07:17.910 --> 07:19.180
- Who the devil are you?

07:19.180 --> 07:20.830
- Upon my word, sir, I
never would've dreamt

07:20.830 --> 07:21.663
of such a thing.

07:25.190 --> 07:26.313
- Please, sit down.

07:31.660 --> 07:35.430
- I had left my watch
upon the table downstairs

07:35.430 --> 07:38.040
you see, sir, where I had
enjoyed a brandy or two

07:38.040 --> 07:39.190
with another gentleman.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.883
Then upon returning to my room I realized.

07:44.940 --> 07:49.083
With my candle, I set out
to retrieve it, which I did.

07:50.598 --> 07:53.265
(ominous music)

08:07.407 --> 08:10.830
But coming back, all those stairs, sir,

08:10.830 --> 08:13.813
they were difficult to climb...

08:13.813 --> 08:15.929
endless corridors.

08:17.690 --> 08:18.890
I became quite lost.

08:19.856 --> 08:22.523
(ominous music)

08:33.352 --> 08:35.891
I tried many doors,

08:35.891 --> 08:38.290
and at last I thought
that I had found my room,

08:39.850 --> 08:41.424
and I went in.

08:41.424 --> 08:44.091
(ominous music)

08:50.152 --> 08:52.485
(muttering)

09:03.030 --> 09:04.660
- Well, go on!

09:04.660 --> 09:08.560
- So, I went in, and got undressed,

09:08.560 --> 09:10.820
got into bed and drew the curtains.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.653
Then...

09:12.570 --> 09:15.080
Imagine, if you will sir,

09:15.080 --> 09:16.188
my fear

09:18.704 --> 09:22.104
when I heard another presence

09:22.104 --> 09:22.937
in the room.

09:24.342 --> 09:26.150
- A presence?

09:26.150 --> 09:26.983
- Yes.

09:27.931 --> 09:30.848
(mysterious music)

09:53.850 --> 09:55.950
- And pray, sir, what action did you take?

09:57.500 --> 10:00.620
- Well, I had to make
my presence known, sir.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.030
Do you see?

10:02.030 --> 10:02.933
What could I do?

10:05.550 --> 10:07.480
Delicacy would not permit me

10:08.500 --> 10:10.933
to be seen by a lady,

10:12.449 --> 10:14.430
in my nightcap.

10:14.430 --> 10:15.263
- A lady?

10:16.230 --> 10:17.330
- Yes, sir.

10:17.330 --> 10:18.763
I was in a lady's bedroom.

10:20.441 --> 10:25.441
(whimsical music)
(humming)

10:37.193 --> 10:42.193
(ominous music)
(creaking boards)

10:45.500 --> 10:48.450
Time was against me, so I shouted out,

10:48.450 --> 10:50.110
"Ahem!"

10:50.110 --> 10:51.003
Very loudly.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.513
- Pray, sir.

10:54.513 --> 10:55.620
What was the lady's response?

10:55.620 --> 10:57.690
- I regret, a violent one.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.715
She screamed most horribly

11:00.715 --> 11:02.664
and pushed me out of the room.

11:02.664 --> 11:04.873
She threatened me with an umbrella!

11:06.480 --> 11:09.830
I had no candle and needed assistance,

11:09.830 --> 11:13.620
and so you see, I am at your mercy, sir.

11:13.620 --> 11:17.740
(knocking)
(tense music)

11:17.740 --> 11:19.790
- Quick, quick, hide!

11:19.790 --> 11:22.290
(tense music)

11:28.555 --> 11:29.388
Can I help you?

11:29.388 --> 11:30.221
- Where is he?

11:30.221 --> 11:31.060
Where is the brute?

11:31.060 --> 11:33.520
- With respect, madam,
are you referring to me?

11:33.520 --> 11:35.950
- I trust, sir, that you are a gentleman.

11:35.950 --> 11:37.720
But there is a rogue in our midst.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.760
A bespectacled rogue, sir,

11:39.760 --> 11:41.283
who has affronted my modesty.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.540
I am but a helpless
female, sir, as you see!

11:45.540 --> 11:47.773
- This is a most shocking tale, madam.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.730
I did think... I thought
I heard some footsteps

11:51.730 --> 11:53.580
come past my door a few minutes back.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.482
(tense music)

12:02.745 --> 12:04.270
Uh...

12:04.270 --> 12:07.213
Please, take my coat, for
the sake of your modesty.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.180
- Thank you, sir.

12:09.180 --> 12:10.013
Very well.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.940
I will pursue the rascal.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.583
I will call the Constable.

12:15.566 --> 12:18.108
Is no woman safe?

12:18.108 --> 12:20.608
(tense music)

12:26.750 --> 12:29.160
- Sir, it's safe to come out.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.513
- God bless you, sir.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.323
You have my undying gratitude, mister-

12:35.323 --> 12:36.240
- Dickens.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.590
Charles M.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.610
And you are?

12:38.610 --> 12:40.503
- Pickwick, sir, at your service.

12:43.964 --> 12:44.797
(ominous music)

12:46.030 --> 12:48.683
This is a hazardous place, sir.

12:51.347 --> 12:52.892
Sir?

12:52.892 --> 12:55.809
(mysterious music)

13:02.099 --> 13:02.932
- It's...

13:04.377 --> 13:07.630
rather cold in those corridors,
please, take my coat.

13:07.630 --> 13:08.820
- I couldn't possibly sir-

13:08.820 --> 13:10.623
- No, no, no, I insist.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.163
- Well then, sir.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.753
Thank you.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.230
I bid you goodnight.

13:22.190 --> 13:23.023
- Goodnight.

13:29.693 --> 13:32.360
(ominous music)

13:37.665 --> 13:38.620
(laughs)

13:38.620 --> 13:40.850
I do hope Mr. Pickwick
doesn't meet his nemesis

13:40.850 --> 13:42.050
in those dark corridors.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.010
Candle.

13:51.010 --> 13:52.960
He should have a candle.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.027
Mr. Pickwick!

13:55.429 --> 13:56.262
Pickwck?

13:58.568 --> 13:59.651
Mr. Pickwick?

14:02.065 --> 14:02.898
Huh.

14:05.420 --> 14:10.367
This place is like a
barn, and as cold as one.

14:11.407 --> 14:14.324
(mysterious music)

14:35.006 --> 14:37.756
(pen scribbling)

14:43.432 --> 14:45.265
"The Pickwick Papers".

14:56.592 --> 15:00.259
It is nothing but a coat
hanging on the door.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.280
(1940s dancehall music)

15:39.677 --> 15:40.760
- Mr. Gibson.

15:42.639 --> 15:43.556
Mr. Gibson.

15:45.263 --> 15:46.500
Mr. Gibson?

15:46.500 --> 15:47.870
- Good evening, David.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.200
- Good evening, Mr. Gibson.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.292
And how are you, sir?

15:50.292 --> 15:51.386
- I'm very well, thank you.

15:51.386 --> 15:52.280
And yourself?

15:52.280 --> 15:53.612
- I'm fine.

15:53.612 --> 15:55.930
- How old is your little one now?

15:55.930 --> 15:59.020
- Oh, young Sebastian, he
turned three last month.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.100
- Three?

16:00.100 --> 16:01.863
Goodness, doesn't time fly?

16:04.410 --> 16:06.130
- The same as usual, sir?

16:06.130 --> 16:07.063
- The same, David.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.400
- No flowers this year?

16:12.700 --> 16:14.253
- Uh, no, no, not this year.

16:15.110 --> 16:17.150
- Well, you know we can always
arrange something for you.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.090
- Ah, I felt it was getting a bit stale,

16:19.090 --> 16:20.173
a bit of a cliche.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.193
- Of course.

16:28.131 --> 16:30.130
You're all booked in, room 218.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.220
- Thank you.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.170
Oh, one other thing.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.420
How do I look?

16:34.420 --> 16:37.410
- You look perfectly handsome, Mr. Gibson.

16:37.410 --> 16:38.350
- That's good to know.

16:38.350 --> 16:39.400
That is good to know.

16:59.972 --> 17:00.805
218.

17:15.145 --> 17:16.640
(knocking)

17:16.640 --> 17:17.473
- Come in.

17:18.632 --> 17:22.253
(faint dancehall music)

17:22.253 --> 17:24.920
Tim.
- Julie, you look ravishing.

17:26.904 --> 17:28.413
- Thank you.

17:28.413 --> 17:29.290
- I brought you some flowers.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.433
- Oh, beautiful.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.260
How was your journey?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.120
- Fine.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.780
- Did you remember to lock the back door?

17:34.780 --> 17:36.860
- And I turned off the
light in the hall, and-

17:36.860 --> 17:38.592
- Happy anniversary.

17:38.592 --> 17:39.592
- Happy anniversary.

17:42.650 --> 17:43.830
- Here, let me take this.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.518
You don't need it.

17:45.518 --> 17:46.893
Come on, stand up straight.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.073
- Cheers.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.460
- They look after us
well here, don't they?

17:56.460 --> 17:57.606
- As well as we keep coming.

17:57.606 --> 17:59.530
(chuckles)

17:59.530 --> 18:00.523
- Forty years.

18:02.390 --> 18:04.290
Not many people are married this long.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.140
When do we get the letter from the Queen?

18:07.140 --> 18:09.590
- That's for the 60th, dear, Diamond.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.270
This is our Ruby.

18:11.270 --> 18:13.890
- Oh, so she'll send us the Crown Jewels.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.788
- Maybe a nice bottle of ruby red.

18:15.788 --> 18:17.860
(chuckling)

18:17.860 --> 18:19.043
- Forty years.

18:20.010 --> 18:21.720
Can you believe it?

18:21.720 --> 18:24.040
- I can believe it, I was there.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.143
- For most of it.

18:27.837 --> 18:29.837
- It was a different
world forty years ago.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.000
This room's certainly different.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.903
This new wallpaper, ugh.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.960
There's no accounting
for taste these days.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.390
Or cleanliness.

18:41.390 --> 18:44.390
You know, maybe it hasn't
changed that much after all,

18:44.390 --> 18:46.463
I think they've just
painted over the cracks.

18:46.463 --> 18:47.530
(chuckling)

18:47.530 --> 18:49.290
- Styles change.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.980
Which reminds me, I found something today.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.243
- Show me what you found, Timothy.

18:59.462 --> 19:01.542
Well, I never...

19:01.542 --> 19:02.780
Where did you find this?

19:02.780 --> 19:04.380
- In the loft.

19:04.380 --> 19:07.030
I had a rummage, when Richard
came to fix the boiler.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.413
- You know, some images
in my mind are like smoke.

19:14.490 --> 19:15.470
They come to me quickly,

19:15.470 --> 19:19.090
but break away before I have
a chance to hold onto them.

19:19.090 --> 19:22.870
But this, the day you came home,

19:22.870 --> 19:24.820
it's as clear to me now as it was then.

19:26.068 --> 19:27.220
Have you shown the children?

19:27.220 --> 19:28.750
- I showed Daniel, he loved it.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.350
- Of course.

19:30.350 --> 19:32.650
He can put it in that
family tree he's making.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.470
I think these were some
of my favorite days.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.680
Strange how I can have such fond memories

19:39.680 --> 19:41.810
of such dark times.

19:41.810 --> 19:43.700
- Everything's better in the past.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.551
- Especially the wallpaper.

19:45.551 --> 19:46.914
- Especially the wallpaper.

19:46.914 --> 19:48.030
(laughing)

19:48.030 --> 19:50.120
- We could always add a splash of paint.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.440
This wine's a nice shade of red.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.980
Oh, come on, let's dance.

19:53.980 --> 19:55.730
- No, no, no, my legs aren't up to it.

19:55.730 --> 19:56.563
- Yes they are!

19:56.563 --> 19:57.396
- I said no!

19:58.528 --> 20:01.183
(knocking)

20:01.183 --> 20:03.933
(melancholic music)

20:12.320 --> 20:13.420
- Good evening, Mr. Gibson.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.360
- Where's David?

20:14.360 --> 20:16.050
- David's finished his shift.

20:16.050 --> 20:17.490
- I thought he finished at 9.

20:17.490 --> 20:19.170
- Not these days, no.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.020
I suppose he wants to be with his son.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.150
- [Tim] Oh.

20:22.150 --> 20:23.410
- Dinner for two?

20:23.410 --> 20:25.313
- Yes, right, thank you.

20:26.297 --> 20:27.130
I'll take it.

20:27.130 --> 20:27.963
- Can I help you?

20:27.963 --> 20:29.833
- Nope, that's all, thank you.

20:29.833 --> 20:30.666
- Okay.

20:36.143 --> 20:39.726
(soft piano music)

20:48.261 --> 20:50.370
- There's some new staff this year.

20:50.370 --> 20:51.970
David's not around this evening.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.910
Did you know his son is three now?

20:54.910 --> 20:56.350
- Yes, I heard.

20:56.350 --> 20:57.293
How lovely.

20:59.630 --> 21:02.639
I'm not in a hurry to look
after a toddler again though.

21:02.639 --> 21:03.472
- [Tim] Oh?

21:03.472 --> 21:05.130
- Well, remember Sophie?

21:05.130 --> 21:06.400
- Not so much.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.730
Too sleep deprived most of the time.

21:08.730 --> 21:09.563
- Exactly.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.223
We didn't do too badly though.

21:16.170 --> 21:17.375
Did we?

21:17.375 --> 21:18.208
- What, with Sophie?

21:18.208 --> 21:20.270
- I mean, they both turned
out okay, didn't they?

21:20.270 --> 21:22.610
So, we can't have done a terrible job.

21:22.610 --> 21:25.450
- Julie, I think we did a marvelous job.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.990
Daniel looks after me much better

21:26.990 --> 21:28.803
than I looked after him these days.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.180
Still your favorite?

21:36.180 --> 21:38.114
- Well remembered.

21:44.820 --> 21:45.763
- Are you okay?

21:48.190 --> 21:49.023
- I'm happy.

21:49.870 --> 21:53.003
I'm happy with everything we
did, everything we've done.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.120
- Me too, my lovely.

21:56.120 --> 21:56.953
Me too.

22:07.224 --> 22:10.224
Julie, where's all this coming from?

22:15.320 --> 22:17.473
- I don't think we should
come back next year.

22:18.511 --> 22:22.130
I mean, I don't think you
should come back next year.

22:25.650 --> 22:28.803
Tim, forty years, Tim.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.443
- Here's to fifty.

22:35.870 --> 22:37.123
It's been so wonderful.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.393
- Every single year, every
single minute has been perfect.

22:43.420 --> 22:44.953
But you don't need me anymore.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.539
Not silly old me.

22:47.539 --> 22:49.956
(Tim cries)

22:52.760 --> 22:54.840
- I miss you so much.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.410
I miss you every single day.

22:56.410 --> 22:58.619
- I miss you too, darling.

22:58.619 --> 23:00.419
- Don't take this away.

23:00.419 --> 23:03.863
- I don't want to, but
we both know I have to.

23:07.009 --> 23:07.842
- Yes.

23:09.673 --> 23:11.637
I know.

23:12.562 --> 23:13.500
I know.

23:15.274 --> 23:16.744
- Will you do something for me?

23:16.744 --> 23:18.435
- Anything.

23:18.435 --> 23:19.285
Anything for you.

23:20.124 --> 23:23.207
(dancehall music starts up)

23:58.350 --> 24:00.268
- Thank you for the flowers.

24:00.268 --> 24:01.896
They're beautiful.

24:01.896 --> 24:04.080
- Not as beautiful as you.

25:07.912 --> 25:08.745
(music: 'The Boogie Man Is Here' plays)

25:27.230 --> 25:29.682
- Please be careful with my machine.

25:29.682 --> 25:31.970
(horn beeps)

25:31.970 --> 25:32.803
- [Man] Machine?

25:36.340 --> 25:38.188
- Shall we proceed?

25:48.939 --> 25:51.260
- I've been working here twenty years.

25:51.260 --> 25:52.886
I ain't never seen a ghost.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.700
- The Ghost Club have heard many stories

25:54.700 --> 25:57.360
originating from this hotel.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.900
- Ghost Club?

25:58.900 --> 25:59.883
You got a club?

26:00.830 --> 26:02.610
What you doin' here then?

26:02.610 --> 26:04.240
That's where you'll find your ghosts.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.073
- No.

26:05.073 --> 26:07.730
The Ghost Club is not a club for ghosts.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.850
We explore unexplained phenomena

26:09.850 --> 26:11.980
and seek out links
between this mortal coil

26:11.980 --> 26:13.860
and the spirit plane.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.551
Dickens was a member.

26:24.861 --> 26:27.778
(mysterious music)

27:06.681 --> 27:07.514
(knocking)

27:07.514 --> 27:08.347
Come in.

27:10.970 --> 27:11.870
- Good day, madam.

27:12.940 --> 27:15.000
- Good day, good day.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.090
- Good day.

27:16.090 --> 27:18.800
- And what can I do for you?

27:18.800 --> 27:19.633
- I'm the manager.

27:19.633 --> 27:21.610
- You have my congratulations.

27:21.610 --> 27:23.110
Is that all?

27:23.110 --> 27:24.506
- Yes.

27:24.506 --> 27:25.339
- Hm.

27:27.340 --> 27:28.173
- I mean no.

27:29.170 --> 27:33.260
I understand you're
conducting an investigation.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.354
- Of sorts.

27:34.354 --> 27:36.346
- An investigation into

27:36.346 --> 27:37.536
the paranormal?

27:37.536 --> 27:39.340
- Yes, that is correct.

27:39.340 --> 27:40.173
- Well...

27:41.240 --> 27:42.550
Do you have to?

27:42.550 --> 27:44.370
- I don't have to do anything,

27:44.370 --> 27:46.400
but I want to, and so I shall.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.040
May I present to you,

27:48.040 --> 27:51.240
the creation that will make me famous.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.570
The Spectre-O-Meter.

27:53.570 --> 27:54.730
- Funny name.

27:54.730 --> 27:57.320
- It measures the harmonic
frequency of the atmosphere

27:57.320 --> 28:00.280
and determines if a spirit lurks among us,

28:00.280 --> 28:02.630
and then pinpoints the
whereabouts of the spirit

28:02.630 --> 28:06.183
and expresses it with this
self perpetuating locus device.

28:06.183 --> 28:07.070
- The what?

28:07.070 --> 28:08.370
- This arrow.

28:08.370 --> 28:10.050
Years of studying the spirit world

28:10.050 --> 28:11.210
have left their mark on me,

28:11.210 --> 28:13.460
and the moment I arrived at this hotel,

28:13.460 --> 28:15.980
I could sense a strong spiritual presence.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.240
- You could?

28:17.240 --> 28:18.073
Oh dear!

28:19.928 --> 28:20.845
- Mister...

28:22.532 --> 28:23.708
- Urlowe.

28:23.708 --> 28:24.747
Willy Urlowe.

28:24.747 --> 28:26.121
- Mr. Urlowe.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.010
What do you know of the phantoms
that inhabit your hotel?

28:29.010 --> 28:30.490
- Oh, I don't know.

28:30.490 --> 28:33.170
- Mr. Urlowe, I can tell when information

28:33.170 --> 28:34.700
is being withheld from me,

28:34.700 --> 28:35.980
especially when the information

28:35.980 --> 28:38.460
is being withheld very poorly.

28:38.460 --> 28:39.860
- Oh.

28:39.860 --> 28:42.110
Well, I haven't heard anything myself,

28:42.110 --> 28:45.170
but I think some of the guests have,

28:45.170 --> 28:46.850
and then there was...

28:46.850 --> 28:48.182
- Yes?

28:48.182 --> 28:51.040
- There was that incident
with a predecessor of mine.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.930
But it's something that
the staff of this hotel

28:52.930 --> 28:54.150
would much rather forget,

28:54.150 --> 28:56.570
which is why we don't
discuss what happened

28:56.570 --> 28:57.670
with the guests, you see.

28:57.670 --> 29:00.750
- Mr. Urlowe, I am no ordinary guest.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.203
- Well, no, of course not, forgive me.

29:04.180 --> 29:05.570
- Well?

29:05.570 --> 29:06.403
- Well, what?

29:06.403 --> 29:07.629
- What happened?

29:07.629 --> 29:08.462
- Oh.

29:13.170 --> 29:14.680
He was murdered.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.617
Most unpleasantly,

29:16.617 --> 29:18.550
by his wife.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.720
Big kitchen knife.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.900
Horrible.

29:21.900 --> 29:24.600
The guests sometimes hear
him crying in the corridors.

29:25.951 --> 29:26.784
(man yells)

29:26.784 --> 29:27.742
Poor chap.

29:27.742 --> 29:29.260
- And the wife?

29:29.260 --> 29:30.093
- Quite mad.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.413
They found her in the bath in room 223.

29:37.460 --> 29:41.640
- Ah, violent death and suicide.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.920
Possible unfinished business.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.220
Could be sentient.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.620
Excellent!

29:47.620 --> 29:48.890
This is excellent.

29:48.890 --> 29:51.040
And has the wife's spirit ever been seen?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.190
- I don't know, and I don't want to know!

29:53.190 --> 29:55.440
Ghosts are bad for business.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.080
No one wants to stay in a hotel

29:57.080 --> 29:59.310
where there's ghouls and
spectres and what have you.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.410
- Mr. Urlowe,

30:00.410 --> 30:02.350
I have traveled all the way from London

30:02.350 --> 30:03.630
to stay in this hotel,

30:03.630 --> 30:05.780
and for just one reason.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.000
- The charming rooms?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.030
- No, Mr. Urlowe.

30:08.030 --> 30:10.740
The rumors of otherworldly phenomena.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.210
If I'm prepared to stay in this hotel

30:12.210 --> 30:13.520
for that sole reason,

30:13.520 --> 30:16.540
don't you think others will
be tempted to do the same?

30:16.540 --> 30:19.670
- [Willy] Well, when
you put it that way...

30:19.670 --> 30:22.547
- Now, I'm determined
to try my machine here,

30:22.547 --> 30:24.383
and I invite you to join me.

30:25.690 --> 30:26.770
- [Willy] I don't think-

30:26.770 --> 30:27.900
- Courage, Mr. Urlowe.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.680
The spirits cannot harm you.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.500
Aren't you curious about your hotel

30:31.500 --> 30:33.910
and the mysteries here within?

30:33.910 --> 30:35.170
- Very well.

30:35.170 --> 30:36.210
You're going to do it anyway,

30:36.210 --> 30:37.623
and I suppose I'd rather be here

30:37.623 --> 30:39.261
when you switch it on.

30:39.261 --> 30:40.261
- Very good.

30:45.307 --> 30:46.473
Let us begin!

30:51.023 --> 30:54.128
(machine whirring)

30:54.128 --> 30:57.378
(electricity sparking)

31:03.236 --> 31:04.452
Look!

31:06.052 --> 31:07.902
(dramatic music)

31:28.716 --> 31:29.974
(machine stops)

31:32.677 --> 31:34.673
(knocking)

31:34.673 --> 31:35.731
- Oh, no!

31:41.347 --> 31:43.620
(knocking)

31:43.620 --> 31:45.230
- Spirit!

31:45.230 --> 31:46.910
Reveal yourself!

31:46.910 --> 31:48.673
I am your friend!

31:54.340 --> 31:55.173
- Spirit?

31:56.580 --> 31:57.980
It's only me.

31:57.980 --> 31:58.813
- Blast!

31:58.813 --> 31:59.646
You didn't see a phantom

31:59.646 --> 32:01.560
on the other side of that door, did you?

32:03.520 --> 32:04.950
- No.

32:04.950 --> 32:06.383
Can't say that I did.

32:07.430 --> 32:08.263
- Curses!

32:08.263 --> 32:09.820
Failed again.

32:09.820 --> 32:11.420
Blast this machine!

32:11.420 --> 32:14.870
- I came to see what
all the noise was about.

32:14.870 --> 32:16.913
The lights was flickering downstairs.

32:18.664 --> 32:20.501
I heard you talking to someone.

32:20.501 --> 32:22.929
- Yes, to Mr. Urlowe.

32:22.929 --> 32:24.570
- Mr. Urlowe?

32:24.570 --> 32:26.480
- Yes, Urlowe, the manager.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.100
He's in the wardrobe.

32:28.100 --> 32:29.860
He joined me in my experiment.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.070
My failed experiment.

32:32.070 --> 32:34.113
Mr. Urlowe, you can come out now.

32:35.830 --> 32:37.740
- Mr. Urlowe's dead.

32:37.740 --> 32:38.889
- What?

32:38.889 --> 32:40.943
No, he's in the wardrobe, I tell you.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.213
See?

32:46.195 --> 32:47.623
- He can't be.

32:47.623 --> 32:51.341
(fearful whimpering)

32:51.341 --> 32:52.258
Mr. Urlowe?

32:54.586 --> 32:57.890
- This is the manager
of the hotel, is it not?

32:57.890 --> 32:58.893
- I'm the manager.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.260
- Calm down, Mr. Urlowe.

33:05.327 --> 33:08.027
- He was murdered.

33:08.027 --> 33:10.493
That's what happened to him

33:10.493 --> 33:12.581
In this hotel.

33:12.581 --> 33:17.581
(frantic shrieking)
(dramatic music)

33:20.447 --> 33:21.280
(lightning and thunder)

33:32.268 --> 33:35.101
(thunder rumbles)

33:36.590 --> 33:39.300
- [Man] The killer
stepped from the shadows.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.650
Laura knew with cold certainty

33:42.650 --> 33:46.133
that she would not live
to see the morning.

33:47.265 --> 33:52.265
(thunder rumbles)

34:02.313 --> 34:03.563
- Good evening.

34:04.690 --> 34:05.523
- Evening.

34:10.054 --> 34:12.060
- I'd like a room, please.

34:12.060 --> 34:13.130
- Yes.

34:13.130 --> 34:13.963
Yes, of course.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.590
How long are you staying with us, mister-

34:17.590 --> 34:18.780
- Fearless.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.270
Peter Fearless.

34:20.270 --> 34:21.103
- Mr. Fearless.

34:21.103 --> 34:22.113
- A couple of nights.

34:27.220 --> 34:29.236
- Room 17 is...

34:29.236 --> 34:30.644
well, it's really very comfortable.

34:30.644 --> 34:32.766
- Is it a quiet room?

34:32.766 --> 34:34.824
I need a quiet room.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.420
- All our rooms are quiet.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.820
- Well, that's good to hear.

34:41.420 --> 34:42.547
- Do you need a hand with your-

34:42.547 --> 34:43.680
- Just the key.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.120
Good evening.

34:48.334 --> 34:51.251
(mysterious music)

35:02.245 --> 35:03.203
- You are not going to believe

35:03.203 --> 35:04.540
who's just walked in.

35:05.790 --> 35:08.015
Yeah, I heard he had
some sort of breakdown.

35:10.350 --> 35:12.683
I... guess he's alright now.

35:15.913 --> 35:18.913
(typewriter typing)

35:49.590 --> 35:51.650
- Malcolm, it's Peter.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.920
- [Malcolm] Peter, where the hell are you?

35:54.920 --> 35:56.020
- Suffolk.

35:56.020 --> 35:57.520
Ipswich, would you believe?

35:57.520 --> 35:58.800
- [Malcolm] Ipswich?

35:58.800 --> 35:59.690
Are you alright?

35:59.690 --> 36:00.540
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:01.540 --> 36:03.675
Bloody great in fact, Malc.

36:03.675 --> 36:04.592
Look, Malc,

36:05.520 --> 36:07.093
I've started the new book.

36:08.090 --> 36:11.360
- [Malcolm] Wow, Peter, that's fantastic.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.380
- I thought I'd stick with
a traditional ghost story

36:14.380 --> 36:16.610
rather than guts and gore this time.

36:16.610 --> 36:20.664
Suffolk has lots of ghosts and legends.

36:20.664 --> 36:22.364
I might borrow a few for the book.

36:23.353 --> 36:24.657
- [Malcolm] As long as you're okay.

36:24.657 --> 36:27.217
Are you taking your...

36:27.217 --> 36:28.660
You know, the-

36:28.660 --> 36:30.200
- Yes.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.033
I'm taking them.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.730
I'm not stupid,

36:33.730 --> 36:35.130
I just need some peace and quiet

36:35.130 --> 36:37.544
to get on with my work, you know?

36:37.544 --> 36:39.842
Make us both rich.

37:03.759 --> 37:06.259
(tense music)

37:20.625 --> 37:21.458
(low growling)

37:31.814 --> 37:34.564
(monster growls)

37:53.538 --> 37:55.871
(dog barks)

38:01.900 --> 38:03.730
You told me all the rooms were quiet.

38:03.730 --> 38:04.563
- Mr. Fearless.

38:04.563 --> 38:05.790
- The dog in the next door room

38:05.790 --> 38:07.548
is making it impossible for me to work.

38:07.548 --> 38:08.648
- We don't allow dogs in here.

38:08.648 --> 38:10.063
- That's plainly not the case.

38:11.770 --> 38:14.270
(tense music)

38:16.490 --> 38:19.420
Well, your pipes must be very rusty.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.263
- My pipes are just fine, thank you.

38:23.810 --> 38:25.223
- I'd like coffee in my room,

38:26.340 --> 38:28.257
and a bottle of scotch.

38:43.010 --> 38:45.543
You bloody idiot,

38:45.543 --> 38:47.342
you dreamt it.

38:52.543 --> 38:55.293
(brush rustling)

39:01.854 --> 39:03.437
Bloody Black Shuck.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.518
(typewriter typing)

39:39.853 --> 39:42.770
(mysterious music)

39:49.278 --> 39:51.778
(tense music)

40:10.017 --> 40:12.270
(phone ringing)

40:12.270 --> 40:13.103
Yes?

40:13.103 --> 40:14.560
- [Receptionist] Mr. Fearless?

40:14.560 --> 40:15.393
- Yes.

40:15.393 --> 40:18.393
- [Receptionist] You have a visitor.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.713
- Peter!

40:30.590 --> 40:31.980
I'm checking out.

40:31.980 --> 40:32.893
Miss, my bill?

40:36.790 --> 40:38.290
- Let's have one for the road.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.013
- [Waitress] Can I get
you another round, gents?

40:49.920 --> 40:51.720
- It's brilliant, Peter.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.553
It's brilliant.

40:52.553 --> 40:54.360
This is your best work.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.260
- I can't see me finishing it now.

40:58.080 --> 40:58.913
- Really?

40:59.910 --> 41:01.360
- I haven't got it in me Malc,

41:02.210 --> 41:03.670
not since the breakdown.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.610
- Yeah, but you've made
a complete recovery,

41:05.610 --> 41:09.230
you're 100% fit, according to the doc.

41:09.230 --> 41:10.483
- Peter Fearless.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.570
I used to live up to my name.

41:15.210 --> 41:16.660
Now I'm afraid of everything.

41:20.580 --> 41:23.283
- You spend one more
night at the hotel, on me,

41:24.429 --> 41:27.130
a bottle of Johnny Walker, forty Rothmans,

41:27.130 --> 41:29.046
old faithful here...

41:29.046 --> 41:30.904
you just let it all hang out

41:30.904 --> 41:33.092
and you just see what happens.

41:34.297 --> 41:37.483
Spanish villa won't dig its
own swimming pool after all.

41:37.483 --> 41:39.830
- No, not for me, Peter, no.

41:39.830 --> 41:40.793
For you.

41:41.740 --> 41:44.247
You've got to prove the doubters wrong,

41:44.247 --> 41:45.585
and you've got to prove

41:45.585 --> 41:47.480
that you still got what it takes.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.207
- There we go, gents.

42:00.298 --> 42:01.930
- What if I can't hack it?

42:01.930 --> 42:03.930
- You may not succeed, but as your ag...

42:05.148 --> 42:06.514
As your friend,

42:06.514 --> 42:08.948
I think that you should at least try.

42:16.976 --> 42:19.476
(tense music)

42:25.421 --> 42:28.421
(typewriter typing)

42:43.195 --> 42:45.945
(monster growls)

43:02.510 --> 43:04.010
- [Secretary] You have
reached the practice

43:04.010 --> 43:05.651
of Dr. James Mathis.

43:05.651 --> 43:08.660
Leave a message, we'll get
back as soon as we can.

43:08.660 --> 43:12.030
- Dr. Mathis, it's Peter
Fearless, the writer.

43:12.030 --> 43:15.210
Those pills, I'm having
some side effects, I'm...

43:17.642 --> 43:22.642
(monster growls)

43:51.090 --> 43:51.953
Still got it.

43:58.110 --> 44:00.753
No, no, I'm just a humble writer.

44:02.150 --> 44:03.620
You need to talk to the fans,

44:03.620 --> 44:05.570
they're the real experts.

44:05.570 --> 44:07.960
I'm just here to set an example for them,

44:07.960 --> 44:11.750
to help people face their fears.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.963
A kind of spiritual guide
through troubled times.

44:18.257 --> 44:20.924
(loud crash)

44:43.813 --> 44:46.480
(monster growls)

45:00.700 --> 45:01.533
(intense music)

45:12.801 --> 45:15.634
(thunder rumbles)

45:20.283 --> 45:21.570
(knocking)

45:21.570 --> 45:22.820
- Mr. Fearless.

45:25.392 --> 45:27.335
(knocking)

45:27.335 --> 45:28.418
Mr. Fearless?

45:29.260 --> 45:32.427
We've had a complaint about the noise.

45:47.229 --> 45:49.896
(woman screams)

45:51.269 --> 45:54.019
(dramatic music)

46:29.050 --> 46:31.633
(bell tolling)

46:40.579 --> 46:41.710
- Come on.

46:41.710 --> 46:45.767
Let's get registered,
then we can have a drink.

46:50.275 --> 46:52.692
(bell rings)

46:55.530 --> 46:56.363
Evening, squire.

46:58.510 --> 47:00.020
- What can I do for you?

47:00.020 --> 47:01.853
- I've booked a room,

47:01.853 --> 47:03.727
Mr. and Mrs. Jones?

47:08.010 --> 47:09.133
- Unusual name.

47:16.180 --> 47:17.690
Recently married?

47:17.690 --> 47:18.523
- Yes, very.

47:24.793 --> 47:26.450
- Room 27.

47:26.450 --> 47:28.750
Along the corridor, up
the stairs, turn left,

47:28.750 --> 47:30.360
can't miss it.

47:30.360 --> 47:32.770
Bathroom is third on the left,

47:32.770 --> 47:34.583
breakfast 7:30 sharp.

47:35.620 --> 47:36.613
Full English?

47:37.690 --> 47:38.523
- Blimey.

47:38.523 --> 47:39.710
Yes, thanks.
- Thank you.

47:48.615 --> 47:51.698
(lighthearted music)

47:52.984 --> 47:54.055
Don't, Eddie!

47:54.055 --> 47:55.491
- Sorry!

48:02.171 --> 48:04.102
Did you get the, you know-

48:04.102 --> 48:05.792
- No, what?

48:05.792 --> 48:06.637
- Eddie, you know, the thing.

48:06.637 --> 48:08.320
- Oh, no, I forgot.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.153
- Eddie!

48:09.153 --> 48:10.443
- Of course I got it.

48:10.443 --> 48:12.410
A pack of three actually,
make a night of it.

48:12.410 --> 48:14.740
I told ya, I know my way around.

48:14.740 --> 48:16.270
Man of the world, me.

48:18.627 --> 48:21.044
(bell tolls)

48:23.829 --> 48:25.679
- I can't remember which way we turn.

48:28.124 --> 48:30.124
- I think we're in here.

48:31.546 --> 48:32.629
- What is it?

48:33.562 --> 48:37.729
- Nothing, just can't
believe we got away with it.

48:56.460 --> 48:59.117
- You do love me, don't you?

48:59.117 --> 49:00.200
- Of course I do, sweetheart.

49:00.200 --> 49:03.040
Would I do all this for
someone I didn't love?

49:03.040 --> 49:04.707
- No, I suppose not.

49:34.110 --> 49:36.030
- Come on, Mrs. Jones.

49:36.030 --> 49:37.521
Get that down ya.

49:42.738 --> 49:44.521
(aircraft engines)

49:48.810 --> 49:50.967
Can't see a thing out there.

49:52.027 --> 49:53.426
(lights flickering)

49:53.426 --> 49:55.356
- What's wrong with the lights?

49:55.356 --> 49:57.950
- It's probably just the wiring.

49:57.950 --> 49:59.395
(lights flickering)

49:59.395 --> 50:00.695
- I don't think it's safe.

50:02.180 --> 50:04.500
- I'll pop downstairs, have
a word with the landlord.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.827
Maybe we can change rooms or something.

50:10.536 --> 50:11.869
- Don't be long.

50:35.381 --> 50:36.214
- [Radio Host] And now this week,

50:36.214 --> 50:38.063
taking a spotlight among the stars

50:38.063 --> 50:39.415
is a young factory worker

50:39.415 --> 50:41.430
who's going to sing for us.

50:41.430 --> 50:43.591
His name is Walter Herbert Collier-

50:43.591 --> 50:44.424
- Hello?

50:47.172 --> 50:48.005
Hello?

50:49.798 --> 50:52.215
(bell rings)

50:55.554 --> 50:58.554
(lights flickering)

50:59.917 --> 51:00.750
- Eddie?

51:02.636 --> 51:03.469
Eddie?

51:06.840 --> 51:09.757
(mysterious music)

51:18.253 --> 51:19.922
- Hello?

51:19.922 --> 51:22.589
(aircraft engines)

51:27.187 --> 51:28.020
(sirens start up)

51:31.143 --> 51:32.584
- Eddie,

51:32.584 --> 51:34.142
is this a joke?

51:35.016 --> 51:37.766
(sirens blaring)

51:39.584 --> 51:42.501
(aircraft engines)

51:43.565 --> 51:46.482
(light flickering)

51:52.355 --> 51:53.188
(loud bang)

51:57.900 --> 51:58.733
- Betsy.

52:00.700 --> 52:01.533
Betsy.

52:02.792 --> 52:06.446
- Eddie.

52:06.446 --> 52:08.687
Hold me tight, Eddie.

52:10.867 --> 52:12.880
It was so strange.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.800
The light was flickering,

52:14.800 --> 52:17.400
and then the room was filled with ash,

52:17.400 --> 52:19.400
just drifting through the air like snow.

52:21.270 --> 52:24.000
And then I woke up, and you were here.

52:26.315 --> 52:27.455
- It was dead quiet down there,

52:27.455 --> 52:29.308
except for the wireless.

52:29.308 --> 52:30.530
But when I came back up,

52:30.530 --> 52:33.570
the landlady was waiting
in that long passage.

52:33.570 --> 52:36.120
Said she could make us cocoa if we'd like.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.210
I said maybe later.

52:37.210 --> 52:38.390
- Oh, I could do with that cocoa,

52:38.390 --> 52:39.603
it's freezing in here.

52:40.620 --> 52:41.670
- It'll be warm under the covers.

52:41.670 --> 52:45.600
- Oh, no, Eddie I can't,
not now, I'm scared.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.080
- You're safe with me.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.630
- No, there's something
odd in this place, I can't.

52:51.400 --> 52:52.400
- I paid for it all.

52:53.460 --> 52:54.673
Most of my wages.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.703
I love you, Betsy.

53:01.295 --> 53:03.236
I want you to be all mine.

53:03.236 --> 53:05.892
- Eddie, I said no.

53:05.892 --> 53:08.142
(knocking)

53:12.200 --> 53:13.950
- Everything all right, Mrs. Jones?

53:15.580 --> 53:16.413
- No.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.280
I need to go home.

53:28.980 --> 53:31.397
(door shuts)

53:40.207 --> 53:41.763
- My bloody wages.

53:46.990 --> 53:48.873
Yeah, very funny.

53:48.873 --> 53:50.680
(lights flickering)

53:50.680 --> 53:52.305
I paid good money for this room!

53:52.305 --> 53:54.685
(banging)

53:54.685 --> 53:55.602
Let me out!

53:57.135 --> 53:58.052
Let me out!

53:59.416 --> 54:02.166
(falling rubble)

54:06.940 --> 54:08.260
- Just hang on a minute for me, Fred.

54:08.260 --> 54:09.450
We've got time before the bus.

54:09.450 --> 54:10.353
- All right, love.

54:11.950 --> 54:12.930
- Hello there.

54:12.930 --> 54:13.910
- How can I help you, madam?

54:13.910 --> 54:16.003
- I wondered if your wife was around.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.490
- What's this regarding?

54:19.490 --> 54:21.304
- She did me a favor the
last time I was here,

54:21.304 --> 54:22.654
I just wanted to thank her.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.850
- You must've been a little girl.

54:28.300 --> 54:30.083
My wife passed away during the war.

54:31.650 --> 54:34.223
- Oh dear, I'm so sorry,
I must've made a mistake.

54:35.860 --> 54:36.943
- It was back in '43.

54:39.270 --> 54:41.030
Most of the German
bombing was over the docks

54:41.030 --> 54:43.213
or on Ransomes, the munitions factory.

54:45.210 --> 54:47.910
I was a warden on duty, but
I didn't like leaving her.

54:49.670 --> 54:51.027
Not in her condition.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.130
She promised me she'd be able to get

54:58.130 --> 54:59.938
down to the cellar if it got bad, but...

55:02.248 --> 55:04.206
in the end, she didn't have time.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.440
Bomb hit the east wing of the hotel.

55:11.410 --> 55:12.353
Brought it all down.

55:15.060 --> 55:18.407
Seven dead, including my Daphne.

55:23.060 --> 55:25.610
- I was so sure it was this hotel.

55:25.610 --> 55:28.680
Room 27 B.

55:29.773 --> 55:31.773
- The B rooms were all in the east wing.

55:33.320 --> 55:34.470
Bomb took 'em all down.

55:36.300 --> 55:37.133
- Right.

55:40.260 --> 55:41.180
Come on, Fred.

55:41.180 --> 55:42.847
Let's catch our bus.

56:32.340 --> 56:36.368
- As of now, you are a
representative of this hotel,

56:36.368 --> 56:38.803
and you must always
present yourself smartly.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.623
This is for you.

56:42.450 --> 56:44.300
- Uh, actually it's Maisy.

56:44.300 --> 56:47.033
- [Woman] Any further
questions, direct them to Tom.

56:48.900 --> 56:50.890
- Is she always like that?

56:50.890 --> 56:52.230
- Always.

56:52.230 --> 56:54.120
Don't worry, it's easy
to win her approval.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.440
Just think Victorian servant.

56:56.440 --> 56:59.280
- Be seen and not heard, don't
have any ideas of my own.

56:59.280 --> 57:00.780
Anything else?

57:00.780 --> 57:01.730
- Try not to smile?

57:02.950 --> 57:05.890
- [Woman] Come along, these
rooms won't clean themselves.

57:05.890 --> 57:06.937
- We better go.

57:09.280 --> 57:10.113
- Daisy.

57:11.480 --> 57:14.180
- All the rooms on this
floor need to be spotless

57:14.180 --> 57:16.110
by one o'clock.

57:16.110 --> 57:18.900
Remember, the devil's in...

57:23.600 --> 57:24.433
the detail.

57:26.820 --> 57:28.683
I have high hopes for you, Daisy.

57:29.808 --> 57:30.641
- Maisy!

57:32.660 --> 57:33.493
- Alright,

57:34.500 --> 57:35.640
I'll start at the other end,

57:35.640 --> 57:37.023
and we'll meet in the middle.

57:38.345 --> 57:40.070
The last one to finish
buys the first drinks?

57:40.070 --> 57:41.640
- Alright.

57:41.640 --> 57:43.215
- See you later then,

57:43.215 --> 57:44.048
Daisy.

57:48.697 --> 57:53.697
(mysterious music)
(keys jingling)

58:12.781 --> 58:13.683
- Seriously?

58:18.220 --> 58:20.628
You've got to be kidding me.

58:41.041 --> 58:44.116
(mysterious music)

58:49.607 --> 58:50.440
(vacuum running)

59:40.979 --> 59:41.812
Hm?

59:48.133 --> 59:50.633
(door creaks)

59:55.676 --> 59:56.653
- Wow, that is a mess.

59:56.653 --> 59:58.388
- I just cleaned this room.

59:58.388 --> 59:59.221
- You didn't do a very good job.

59:59.221 --> 1:00:02.863
- No, I mean I've already
cleaned this room.

1:00:02.863 --> 1:00:04.530
- Okay...

1:00:04.530 --> 1:00:06.338
well, I need more polish.

1:00:08.919 --> 1:00:11.836
(mysterious music)

1:00:13.086 --> 1:00:15.836
(vacuum running)

1:00:34.329 --> 1:00:39.329
(scrubbing)
(bottle spraying)

1:00:54.135 --> 1:00:54.968
- Ugh!

1:00:56.992 --> 1:00:58.640
(bell rings)

1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:00.550
- Staff never ring the bell, Daisy.

1:01:00.550 --> 1:01:01.400
- There's a problem.

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:02.233
- A problem?

1:01:02.233 --> 1:01:04.130
- Yes, the room, room 116.

1:01:04.130 --> 1:01:05.167
I've tried to clean it,

1:01:05.167 --> 1:01:07.410
but it refuses to stay clean.

1:01:07.410 --> 1:01:11.040
- Look, there are two types of
people in this world, Daisy.

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:13.180
Those to whom the world happens,

1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:15.820
and those who happen to the world.

1:01:15.820 --> 1:01:17.400
You're gonna go back to that room

1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:19.640
and show it who's boss.

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:20.612
Conquer it.

1:01:20.612 --> 1:01:21.788
(phone rings)

1:01:21.788 --> 1:01:23.300
- Please, can I just show you?

1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:25.277
- Time's slipping away, Daisy.

1:01:32.371 --> 1:01:37.371
(mysterious music)
(clock ticking)

1:01:53.224 --> 1:01:55.807
(Maisy breathes in)

1:02:37.992 --> 1:02:40.288
(ominous music)

1:02:40.288 --> 1:02:42.526
(door closes)

1:02:42.526 --> 1:02:45.622
(Maisy groans)

1:02:45.622 --> 1:02:48.105
(whispered voices and dischordant music)

1:03:05.833 --> 1:03:08.454
(bath running)

1:03:08.454 --> 1:03:09.287
(thud)

1:03:18.650 --> 1:03:20.120
- Tom, have you seen Daisy?

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:20.953
- No.

1:03:20.953 --> 1:03:22.920
- Can you give her a hand to finish by 1?

1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:24.140
- So my reward for finishing early

1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:25.290
is to do more work?

1:03:25.290 --> 1:03:27.260
- Practice makes perfect.

1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:30.070
Oh, and don't get too distracted.

1:03:33.868 --> 1:03:36.451
(bath running)

1:03:39.938 --> 1:03:41.640
(knocking)

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:42.473
- Maisy.

1:03:53.508 --> 1:03:54.341
Maisy?

1:03:59.341 --> 1:04:01.924
(bath running)

1:04:30.650 --> 1:04:31.483
Come on!

1:04:39.779 --> 1:04:40.612
Hey!

1:04:42.003 --> 1:04:43.128
Are you okay?

1:04:43.128 --> 1:04:44.461
- It's the room!

1:04:56.672 --> 1:04:57.505
(mysterious music)

1:05:01.674 --> 1:05:04.257
(bath starts running)

1:05:11.151 --> 1:05:13.568
(door slams)

1:05:17.833 --> 1:05:20.403
- I do hope you have a pleasant stay,

1:05:21.350 --> 1:05:23.810
and if there's anything we
can do, anything at all,

1:05:23.810 --> 1:05:25.049
just ask.

1:05:25.049 --> 1:05:26.539
- Thank you.

1:05:26.539 --> 1:05:29.622
(jaunty music)

1:05:43.450 --> 1:05:45.950
(door creaks)

1:05:57.496 --> 1:06:00.360
- What are you doing in my room?

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:04.850
- I'm checking for...

1:06:04.850 --> 1:06:05.900
Mice.
- Mice?!

1:06:05.900 --> 1:06:07.100
- No! Not mice.

1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:08.866
Um...

1:06:08.866 --> 1:06:09.699
rabbits.

1:06:10.910 --> 1:06:12.070
- Rabbits.

1:06:12.070 --> 1:06:13.680
- Yeah.

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:15.730
Yeah, they can be a really big problem.

1:06:15.730 --> 1:06:19.673
Always chewing things,
they've got really big teeth.

1:06:21.921 --> 1:06:23.000
(knocking)

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:23.833
Hello?

1:06:25.340 --> 1:06:26.613
Any rabbits in there?

1:06:30.487 --> 1:06:33.404
(mysterious music)

1:06:41.348 --> 1:06:43.270
- I don't know what to do with you, Bob!

1:06:43.270 --> 1:06:44.680
Head office has been on to me,

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:46.696
and they're suggesting I let you go.

1:06:46.696 --> 1:06:50.605
But I've said no, no,
Bob, he's a nice boy,

1:06:50.605 --> 1:06:53.000
he's a nice boy.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.240
- Thank you, Mrs. Jones.

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.073
- [Mrs. Jones] But I'm not sure

1:06:55.073 --> 1:06:56.649
you've got what it takes, Bob.

1:06:56.649 --> 1:06:57.482
- Well, I do, it's-

1:06:57.482 --> 1:07:00.126
- I think you're more of a lost soul.

1:07:01.570 --> 1:07:04.373
- I spent years just drifting around.

1:07:05.322 --> 1:07:06.870
I don't want to go back there.

1:07:06.870 --> 1:07:08.610
I need a purpose.

1:07:08.610 --> 1:07:09.930
I need this, Mrs. Jones.

1:07:09.930 --> 1:07:12.523
- Then you'd better
back your ideas up, Bob.

1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:14.280
Come up with a plan.

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:16.653
This is your last chance,
then it's curtains.

1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:20.780
- Thank you, Mrs. Jones.

1:07:20.780 --> 1:07:22.573
You won't regret it.

1:07:28.513 --> 1:07:29.346
- Get out.

1:07:32.428 --> 1:07:33.261
Out!

1:07:40.197 --> 1:07:41.443
- You can do this, Bob.

1:07:42.868 --> 1:07:44.743
You're not a nice boy.

1:07:45.621 --> 1:07:46.454
You're a...

1:07:48.059 --> 1:07:50.101
You're a tiger, grr,

1:07:50.101 --> 1:07:50.934
grr!

1:07:52.205 --> 1:07:53.038
Grr!

1:07:55.106 --> 1:07:55.939
Grr!

1:07:59.127 --> 1:07:59.960
GRR!

1:08:02.193 --> 1:08:04.526
(cat meows)

1:08:08.231 --> 1:08:10.448
(Bob yells)

1:08:10.448 --> 1:08:12.781
(screaming)

1:08:16.260 --> 1:08:17.430
- In my office, now!

1:08:21.171 --> 1:08:23.570
- You said I should buck my ideas up.

1:08:23.570 --> 1:08:25.463
- What were you thinking, Bob?

1:08:25.463 --> 1:08:29.110
That poor family were traumatized!

1:08:29.110 --> 1:08:31.917
I wouldn't be surprised if they sue us!

1:08:31.917 --> 1:08:35.290
Oh, head office is gonna
want my head on a block.

1:08:35.290 --> 1:08:37.943
And to be honest, I'd rather it be yours!

1:08:41.610 --> 1:08:42.981
Oh, Bob!

1:08:42.981 --> 1:08:46.827
Can't you hide behind the curtains?

1:08:46.827 --> 1:08:48.895
Woo hoo!

1:08:48.895 --> 1:08:51.736
Move a bit of furniture, or...

1:08:51.736 --> 1:08:56.049
tiptoe round their bedrooms in the night.

1:08:56.049 --> 1:08:57.883
Or waft up and down the stairs.

1:08:58.900 --> 1:09:01.730
Punters love that kind of thing.

1:09:01.730 --> 1:09:04.942
Instead they get some blithering idiot

1:09:04.942 --> 1:09:07.414
wanting to chop up their children!

1:09:07.414 --> 1:09:09.271
- I don't know.

1:09:09.271 --> 1:09:12.438
I guess I'm just not very, you know...

1:09:13.511 --> 1:09:15.159
Ghostly.

1:09:15.159 --> 1:09:17.077
- You must be able to do something, Bob.

1:09:17.077 --> 1:09:17.910
- No.

1:09:19.055 --> 1:09:21.513
I'm a terrible, terrible ghost.

1:09:23.770 --> 1:09:25.977
- Pull yourself together, Bob.

1:09:25.977 --> 1:09:28.144
(sobbing)

1:09:31.270 --> 1:09:33.453
There must be something we can do.

1:09:35.650 --> 1:09:37.817
(sobbing)

1:09:41.445 --> 1:09:42.740
- I've got all sorts of bits and bobs

1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:44.180
in my wardrobe, Mrs. Jones.

1:09:44.180 --> 1:09:46.030
I'm a bit of a magpie, to be honest.

1:09:46.030 --> 1:09:48.440
Hopefully we can find a
look that's more suitable.

1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:50.490
You know, woo!

1:09:50.490 --> 1:09:51.987
Without being too, you know...

1:09:51.987 --> 1:09:54.404
Eurghhh!

1:09:59.165 --> 1:10:02.757
- Are you preparing to
walk through the door?

1:10:02.757 --> 1:10:05.210
- I'm trying to remember
where I left my key.

1:10:05.210 --> 1:10:06.043
- Oh!

1:10:11.703 --> 1:10:12.953
Get in, get in.

1:10:19.231 --> 1:10:22.314
(lighthearted music)

1:10:25.451 --> 1:10:30.451
- Hello, Mrs. Jones,
my name's Mr. Cuddles!

1:10:36.903 --> 1:10:39.486
(catchy music)

1:11:19.050 --> 1:11:21.040
I'll go and put an
outfit on then, shall I?

1:11:29.590 --> 1:11:31.040
- What's that under your arm?

1:11:32.309 --> 1:11:34.000
- It's my head.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.310
I'm a headless ghost.

1:11:35.310 --> 1:11:37.150
- Headless ghost?

1:11:37.150 --> 1:11:39.843
But I can see your head
where your actual head is.

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:43.510
- Well, I haven't worked on that bit yet.

1:11:43.510 --> 1:11:45.870
- Like I said, I'm finding
this whole ghost thing

1:11:45.870 --> 1:11:46.963
all very difficult.

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:49.540
- What other outfits have you got?

1:11:55.700 --> 1:11:58.243
- It's very nice to meet you!

1:11:59.456 --> 1:12:00.289
- No.

1:12:05.844 --> 1:12:08.994
- I've got a present for Mrs. Jones.

1:12:08.994 --> 1:12:11.911
(mysterious music)

1:12:15.342 --> 1:12:17.778
(Mrs. Jones screams)

1:12:17.778 --> 1:12:18.611
- No.

1:12:20.250 --> 1:12:22.410
Have we got a problem here, Bob?

1:12:22.410 --> 1:12:23.510
- I'm starting to get-

1:12:24.397 --> 1:12:25.230
- What?

1:12:25.230 --> 1:12:26.080
- A little bit-
- Little bit-

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:27.190
- Ticked off.

1:12:27.190 --> 1:12:28.240
- Harsh words, Bob.

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:29.570
- I've given you loads of options,

1:12:29.570 --> 1:12:31.800
but you don't seem to like any of them.

1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:33.408
It's really quite...

1:12:33.408 --> 1:12:34.499
frustrating.

1:12:34.499 --> 1:12:35.332
- Frustrating?

1:12:35.332 --> 1:12:36.165
- Mm.

1:12:36.165 --> 1:12:37.810
- You should try being a hotel manager.

1:12:37.810 --> 1:12:40.280
You have to please all
the guests all the time,

1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:42.710
and you have to smile all the time.

1:12:42.710 --> 1:12:45.460
And when you want to get
rid of a member of staff,

1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:48.273
well, the paperwork is a nightmare!

1:12:49.130 --> 1:12:52.630
- Well, let me tell you
something, Mrs. Jones.

1:12:52.630 --> 1:12:54.247
I might be a rubbish ghost,

1:12:54.247 --> 1:12:56.070
but I'm certainly no quitter.

1:12:56.070 --> 1:12:59.430
- What's the plan, Bob?

1:12:59.430 --> 1:13:00.330
- One more outfit.

1:13:01.450 --> 1:13:02.283
Make or break.

1:13:03.390 --> 1:13:04.223
This is it.

1:13:08.568 --> 1:13:10.035
(Mrs. Jones exhales)

1:13:18.996 --> 1:13:20.987
Are you ready, Mrs. Jones?

1:13:20.987 --> 1:13:21.843
- Yes.

1:13:21.843 --> 1:13:22.676
Get on with it.

1:13:27.213 --> 1:13:29.546
(Bob wails)

1:13:31.342 --> 1:13:33.150
(laughing)

1:13:33.150 --> 1:13:35.450
Are you winding me up?

1:13:35.450 --> 1:13:36.283
- What?

1:13:37.170 --> 1:13:38.520
It's a classic.

1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:40.870
The absolute pinnacle of ghostliness.

1:13:40.870 --> 1:13:43.760
The most recognizable and
universally appreciated

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:45.154
symbol of eeriness.

1:13:45.154 --> 1:13:46.430
- It's ridiculous!

1:13:46.430 --> 1:13:47.840
- I think it makes a statement.

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:49.800
I'm a ghost, deal with it.

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:50.834
- Take it off.

1:13:50.834 --> 1:13:51.667
- No.

1:13:51.667 --> 1:13:53.239
- Take it off now!
- No.

1:13:53.239 --> 1:13:55.214
- Get it off!
- No, I won't.

1:13:55.214 --> 1:13:56.389
- Get if off, come on!

1:13:56.389 --> 1:13:58.027
(groaning)

1:13:58.027 --> 1:14:00.527
(tense music)

1:14:03.481 --> 1:14:05.373
(Mrs. Jones screams)

1:14:05.373 --> 1:14:06.831
(a dull thud)

1:14:18.431 --> 1:14:19.810
Now...

1:14:19.810 --> 1:14:21.453
Look what you've done!

1:14:27.636 --> 1:14:31.420
You complete and utter idiot!

1:14:32.296 --> 1:14:34.713
(bell rings)

1:14:35.867 --> 1:14:40.493
(fingers tapping)
(catchy music)

1:14:40.493 --> 1:14:43.599
(giggling)

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:47.559
Come over here!

1:14:47.559 --> 1:14:48.559
- Alright.

1:14:49.718 --> 1:14:51.010
How would you like me?

1:14:51.010 --> 1:14:52.919
- That's perfect, yeah.

1:14:54.364 --> 1:14:55.800
(Mrs. Jones wails)

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:56.760
- [Woman] Oh my gosh!

1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:58.460
- [Man] What's going on?

1:14:58.460 --> 1:14:59.860
- [Woman] What is she doin'?

1:15:01.333 --> 1:15:03.583
(coughing)

1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:07.080
Is that meant to be scary?

1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:08.816
- [Man] She must be mad.

1:15:08.816 --> 1:15:11.760
(Mrs. Jones coughs)

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:13.223
Excuse me, can we help you?

1:15:16.358 --> 1:15:18.608
(glass smashes)

1:15:28.386 --> 1:15:33.386
(ATM beeping)

1:15:53.599 --> 1:15:54.442
- Oh, Jesus,

1:15:54.442 --> 1:15:56.117
Dobby, slow down!

1:16:01.416 --> 1:16:04.666
This isn't doin' my health any good Dobby.

1:16:06.870 --> 1:16:11.870
Slow down, don't draw
attention to ourselves.

1:16:12.410 --> 1:16:13.597
Christ.

1:16:13.597 --> 1:16:16.764
I'm starting to feel a bit Uncle Dick.

1:16:25.528 --> 1:16:26.968
(groaning)

1:16:26.968 --> 1:16:28.526
- You...

1:16:28.526 --> 1:16:29.626
Have...

1:16:29.626 --> 1:16:30.732
Arrived...

1:16:30.732 --> 1:16:31.565
- Give it.

1:16:34.790 --> 1:16:36.950
- Leave it out, George, your missus

1:16:36.950 --> 1:16:39.373
wouldn't even trust
you with her TV remote.

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:42.253
- Not exactly a Premier Inn.

1:16:44.033 --> 1:16:46.450
- It's perfect.

1:16:58.070 --> 1:17:01.560
Beers top floor, stairlift broken.

1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:02.490
Sorry.

1:17:02.490 --> 1:17:04.553
Remind me to give Hobbit a smack.

1:17:13.817 --> 1:17:16.317
(tense music)

1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.366
- Scary, innit?

1:17:25.366 --> 1:17:27.600
- Not as scary as your driving, Dobby.

1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:28.613
- Ha ha.

1:17:28.613 --> 1:17:29.446
- Come on!

1:17:30.409 --> 1:17:33.076
(heartbeats)

1:17:35.420 --> 1:17:38.253
(heavy breathing)

1:17:39.512 --> 1:17:42.381
- You alright, George, mate?

1:17:42.381 --> 1:17:43.393
- A bit sick.

1:17:44.580 --> 1:17:45.413
- Car sick?

1:17:46.310 --> 1:17:48.029
- Sick of your ugly mug.

1:17:48.029 --> 1:17:50.590
(laughing)
(whispering)

1:17:50.590 --> 1:17:51.980
Do you hear that?

1:17:53.133 --> 1:17:54.540
- It's probably Hobbit.

1:17:54.540 --> 1:17:56.734
- Or your tinnitus.
- Come on.

1:17:56.734 --> 1:17:57.567
- Yeah.

1:18:01.583 --> 1:18:04.500
(mysterious music)

1:18:26.410 --> 1:18:28.166
- Well, you've made it.

1:18:28.166 --> 1:18:29.440
(laughing)

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:31.613
- It went like a dream, Hobbit.

1:18:32.524 --> 1:18:34.396
- Yes!
- Yes!

1:18:34.396 --> 1:18:36.646
(laughing)

1:18:39.050 --> 1:18:40.697
- Mickey, boy, we did it.

1:18:41.893 --> 1:18:43.843
The last of the Deptford 8.

1:18:44.710 --> 1:18:46.730
- To the five of us.

1:18:46.730 --> 1:18:51.110
God bless Tonka and Pat, fallen comrades.

1:18:51.110 --> 1:18:52.750
God bless Lenny.

1:18:52.750 --> 1:18:54.700
- Like you could've done it without me.

1:18:55.540 --> 1:18:57.470
I'm surprised you found your way upstairs

1:18:57.470 --> 1:18:58.910
without a pack of guide dogs.

1:18:58.910 --> 1:19:00.810
- That's enough of your lip, sunshine.

1:19:03.754 --> 1:19:06.421
(jarring music and screams)

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:08.930
Right.

1:19:08.930 --> 1:19:11.390
Check the money, every note.

1:19:11.390 --> 1:19:13.177
Any new ones, burn 'em!

1:19:15.972 --> 1:19:18.639
(heart beating)

1:19:31.451 --> 1:19:33.823
- Is that your granddaughter?

1:19:33.823 --> 1:19:34.773
- My little Debbie.

1:19:35.970 --> 1:19:36.920
Isn't she gorgeous?

1:19:38.559 --> 1:19:41.050
I don't want her ending up like us.

1:19:41.050 --> 1:19:42.503
She's gonna be respectable.

1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:50.303
It's family that matters, Mick.

1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:53.643
I'm doing this so she doesn't have to.

1:19:59.390 --> 1:20:00.633
Is anyone else here?

1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:05.213
Terry, Dobby,

1:20:05.213 --> 1:20:06.940
give the place a look.

1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:07.773
Make sure.

1:20:14.300 --> 1:20:16.000
How did you find this place?

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:17.393
- People say it's haunted.

1:20:18.330 --> 1:20:21.770
They keep seeing theses old,

1:20:21.770 --> 1:20:25.030
decrepit corpses wandering around,

1:20:25.030 --> 1:20:27.163
so you two should feel right at home.

1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:29.810
- When I was your age,

1:20:29.810 --> 1:20:33.180
I was out there with a shooter
taking what I was owed.

1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:34.890
You're just a bed wetter

1:20:34.890 --> 1:20:36.170
sat in front of your laptop

1:20:36.170 --> 1:20:37.610
and talking like a tart.

1:20:37.610 --> 1:20:40.573
- Well the days of shooting
your way out are long gone.

1:20:41.970 --> 1:20:43.480
- When you've lived as long as I have,

1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:45.660
you'll find that having
the balls to fire a gun

1:20:45.660 --> 1:20:48.596
buys you a lot of influence in this world.

1:20:48.596 --> 1:20:50.487
(intense heartbeats)

1:20:50.487 --> 1:20:52.737
(choking)

1:21:03.530 --> 1:21:05.095
- Boss?

1:21:05.095 --> 1:21:05.928
BOSS?!

1:21:09.410 --> 1:21:10.243
- Well?

1:21:11.180 --> 1:21:12.013
- Nothing.

1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:17.670
- Where's Dobby?

1:21:17.670 --> 1:21:19.090
- Who?

1:21:19.090 --> 1:21:19.923
- Dobby.

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:21.983
- Don't know him.

1:21:21.983 --> 1:21:24.400
- Are you muggin' me off?

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:26.290
Jackie Dobson.

1:21:26.290 --> 1:21:27.870
Don't mess me about Tel!

1:21:27.870 --> 1:21:31.243
- Boss, it's just the
four of us, and the kid.

1:21:33.304 --> 1:21:34.350
- Have you all lost it?

1:21:34.350 --> 1:21:35.883
Dobby was with us tonight.

1:21:37.130 --> 1:21:38.520
He drove us here!

1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:41.433
- Are you alright?

1:21:41.433 --> 1:21:42.266
- Huh?

1:21:43.150 --> 1:21:43.983
Yeah.

1:21:48.740 --> 1:21:51.550
- He's cracking up.

1:21:51.550 --> 1:21:52.383
- Shut up!

1:21:55.764 --> 1:21:57.247
Boss,

1:21:57.247 --> 1:22:00.370
We're all here, we're all fine,

1:22:00.370 --> 1:22:03.653
and the main thing is, we've got this.

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:08.450
- This place reminds me of
that pub on the highroad.

1:22:08.450 --> 1:22:10.590
Massive rambling place.

1:22:10.590 --> 1:22:11.945
- Oh, yeah.

1:22:11.945 --> 1:22:12.830
Yeah!

1:22:12.830 --> 1:22:14.700
The Black Horse!

1:22:14.700 --> 1:22:16.920
You used to run that with Lenny Maitland.

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:18.120
Right, George?

1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:20.170
- Tricky little fella, Lenny.

1:22:20.170 --> 1:22:22.614
Disappeared with your money, didn't he?

1:22:22.614 --> 1:22:24.164
- Shut up about Lenny Maitland.

1:22:26.260 --> 1:22:28.230
Go and get the rest of the gear.

1:22:28.230 --> 1:22:29.360
- Okay, Boss.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:30.723
Just need to take a leak.

1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:32.723
- Hurry up.

1:22:34.384 --> 1:22:36.801
(man peeing)

1:22:41.534 --> 1:22:43.620
What's going on Tel?

1:22:43.620 --> 1:22:45.440
Am I cracking up?

1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:47.903
- We're all cream crackered, Boss.

1:22:48.911 --> 1:22:52.043
- I can't believe you don't
remember Jackie Dobson.

1:22:56.330 --> 1:22:57.230
Come on, Mountain.

1:22:58.460 --> 1:22:59.713
Sort yourself out.

1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:02.078
- Mountain?

1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:05.612
What Mountain?

1:23:05.612 --> 1:23:07.568
- Are you kiddin' me?

1:23:07.568 --> 1:23:08.401
Mountain!

1:23:09.909 --> 1:23:11.492
He's in the khazi!

1:23:15.672 --> 1:23:18.422
(dramatic music)

1:23:25.093 --> 1:23:27.270
- There's no one else here, mate.

1:23:27.270 --> 1:23:28.570
Just the four of us.

1:23:28.570 --> 1:23:30.200
- The four of us?

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:31.520
There were six of us just now.

1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:33.730
Are you scamming me, Mickey?

1:23:33.730 --> 1:23:35.070
- Calm down!

1:23:35.070 --> 1:23:36.508
Don't go into one.

1:23:36.508 --> 1:23:37.853
- Now you and I go back a long way,

1:23:37.853 --> 1:23:39.755
and you know what I do
to people who cross me,

1:23:39.755 --> 1:23:42.505
so are you gonna tell me what's going on?

1:23:42.505 --> 1:23:44.361
- [Hobbit] What's going
on is you're senile.

1:23:44.361 --> 1:23:45.194
- You little-

1:23:45.194 --> 1:23:47.290
- Mate, you need to calm down!

1:23:47.290 --> 1:23:48.343
You're not well.

1:23:51.136 --> 1:23:53.670
- [Hobbit] That's right,
take a chill pill.

1:23:53.670 --> 1:23:55.750
- Look, you shut up, sonny!

1:23:55.750 --> 1:23:59.270
- Done something to my pills, haven't you?

1:23:59.270 --> 1:24:00.267
- [Hobbit] What pills?

1:24:00.267 --> 1:24:03.503
- Oh, I'm gonna get dark with you, son!

1:24:07.278 --> 1:24:08.660
What's happened to the lights?

1:24:08.660 --> 1:24:10.622
- It's derelict, innit?

1:24:10.622 --> 1:24:12.170
The leccy's been off for years.

1:24:12.170 --> 1:24:13.750
- Losing it, George?

1:24:13.750 --> 1:24:16.403
- Terry, brass knuckles.

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:18.153
Terry!

1:24:19.410 --> 1:24:20.783
- It's just me and you,

1:24:21.890 --> 1:24:23.503
the last of the Deptford 5.

1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:26.850
And Hobbit, if he counts.

1:24:26.850 --> 1:24:28.740
- [George] Deptford 5?

1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:33.420
Terry, Dobby, you can all come out now!

1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:34.545
Do I look like the kind of mug

1:24:34.545 --> 1:24:36.190
that's gonna let you take his money?

1:24:37.981 --> 1:24:40.782
- Is that what Lenny Maitland tried to do?

1:24:40.782 --> 1:24:41.800
- You what?

1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:44.860
- He never ran off with your money.

1:24:44.860 --> 1:24:46.390
You made sure of it.

1:24:46.390 --> 1:24:47.223
- Yeah.

1:24:48.620 --> 1:24:50.803
I see the resemblance now.

1:24:53.465 --> 1:24:56.500
Are you trying to avenge your family?

1:24:56.500 --> 1:24:59.083
I tell you what, I did kill Lenny.

1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:02.750
I bricked your granddad up in the basement

1:25:02.750 --> 1:25:04.433
of the Black Horse Hotel.

1:25:05.543 --> 1:25:07.950
- Oh, yeah, I remember.

1:25:07.950 --> 1:25:10.573
You sent me down to the
cellar to change a barrel,

1:25:11.450 --> 1:25:12.980
hit me from behind,

1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:15.640
next thing I remember,
I'm chained to a pipe,

1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:18.333
brick after brick going up in front of me.

1:25:19.990 --> 1:25:21.473
I begged you for mercy,

1:25:22.469 --> 1:25:24.160
but you just...

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:25.800
You stood there and laughed.

1:25:28.675 --> 1:25:29.947
- Who are you?

1:25:29.947 --> 1:25:31.920
- How many other mates
have you double-crossed

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:33.130
over the years, eh?

1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:35.050
What about tonight?

1:25:36.010 --> 1:25:37.610
You got any plans?

1:25:37.610 --> 1:25:39.336
(gun fires)

1:25:39.336 --> 1:25:40.286
(body slumps)

1:25:41.127 --> 1:25:43.511
- What have you done, George?

1:25:43.511 --> 1:25:44.486
He was one of us!

1:25:44.486 --> 1:25:46.400
- Ah, you remember him!

1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:50.166
But you don't remember
Terry, or Dobby, or Mountain?

1:25:51.276 --> 1:25:52.383
- Please, George!

1:25:53.340 --> 1:25:54.173
- What?

1:25:55.047 --> 1:25:57.610
You want me to think I'm going mad?

1:25:57.610 --> 1:25:59.370
Big mistake.

1:25:59.370 --> 1:26:00.820
You should've just killed me.

1:26:02.270 --> 1:26:03.970
That's what I was gonna do to you.

1:26:05.077 --> 1:26:06.553
- Go to hell George.

1:26:06.553 --> 1:26:09.053
(intense heartbeats)

1:26:12.391 --> 1:26:13.224
(dull thud)

1:26:25.108 --> 1:26:27.858
(George shrieks)

1:26:30.399 --> 1:26:32.566
(sobbing)

1:26:41.093 --> 1:26:42.176
- Tonka, Pat?

1:26:44.697 --> 1:26:45.530
No way.

1:26:46.898 --> 1:26:49.440
- The last of the Deptford 8.

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:51.563
They'd like a word, George.

1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:56.220
- What's happened to my Debbie?

1:26:56.220 --> 1:26:58.390
If you've hurt her...

1:26:58.390 --> 1:27:00.720
- There is no Debbie.

1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:01.853
There's no family.

1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:04.083
They never existed.

1:27:07.648 --> 1:27:10.451
(gun fires)

1:27:10.451 --> 1:27:14.368
(ominous music and voices build)

1:27:14.368 --> 1:27:16.993
(George screams)

1:27:30.405 --> 1:27:33.370
- [Terry] This is the way
he would've wanted to go.

1:27:33.370 --> 1:27:35.063
On a job with his mates.

1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:38.170
- We said no shooters on this one.

1:27:38.170 --> 1:27:39.160
You don't reckon he would've-

1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:41.380
- No way, not George.

1:27:41.380 --> 1:27:42.717
He wouldn't turn on one of his own.

1:27:42.717 --> 1:27:44.828
- He was a true gent, alright.

1:27:44.828 --> 1:27:47.570
- We'll take care of
your little Debbie, Boss.

1:27:47.570 --> 1:27:49.030
- Yeah.

1:27:49.030 --> 1:27:50.703
He would've done the same for us.

1:27:53.460 --> 1:27:55.047
- He's in a better place now.

1:27:55.933 --> 1:27:58.366
(dramatic music builds)

1:28:00.740 --> 1:28:03.490
(cursed screams)
