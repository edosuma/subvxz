both:
What are you talking about?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.511
- I'm talking about this.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.780
Care to explain?
- Sure.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.583
That's my co-worker, Dana,
from the department store.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.719
{\an3}She was helping me pick out
the dress and earrings

20:53.785 --> 20:55.988
I bought Lori.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.056
That's Monica,
from my tour guide job.

20:58.123 --> 21:01.360
She was showing me the most
romantic spots to take Lori to.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.595
And that's Pam
from my dry-cleaning job.

21:03.662 --> 21:04.896
She was fitting me for a tux.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.598
Oh...[chuckles]
and that's Darin.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.434
I met him on the bus.
He was teaching me how to dance.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.504
And in case you were wondering,
Clyde's neighbor is Teri,

21:12.571 --> 21:13.939
my coworker at the pizzeria.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.508
She taught me how to order
in Italian-Mandarin.

21:16.575 --> 21:20.412
{\an8}- Oh wow, so I guess we were
really wrong about the dog.

21:20.479 --> 21:24.583
- Sorry, you guys. We got a
little ahead of ourselves.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.186
{\an1}- Well, you did almost literally
ruin our anniversary.

21:28.253 --> 21:32.791
{\an1}I oughta beat
every one of you,

21:32.858 --> 21:35.794
{\an1}but I appreciate
all of you looking out for me.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.996
- So, you're not mad?

21:41.299 --> 21:45.237
{\an1}- Ahem! I hate to break up
this love-fest,

21:45.303 --> 21:48.974
{\an1}but how do you intend to pay for
my linguini dim sum?

21:49.041 --> 21:52.144
<i>[Italian music]</i>

21:52.210 --> 21:54.479
Hurry up with those
Kung-pao anchovies.

21:54.546 --> 21:57.449
{\an9}- Well, at least all that
working out won't go to waste.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.452
{\an8}[grunting]

22:02.120 --> 22:04.322
- You loosened it.

22:04.389 --> 22:05.323
both: Ugh!
