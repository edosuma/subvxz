00:16.155 --> 00:17.104
Oh, my!

00:17.339 --> 00:18.833
On the dance floor again.

00:19.132 --> 00:20.539
Thank you, bubbles.

00:20.956 --> 00:22.265
Should I try a 1?

00:23.195 --> 00:25.105
Use a 3.
You got more control.

00:26.012 --> 00:28.183
What did you get
on the last hole? Five?

00:28.443 --> 00:29.206
Six.

00:29.467 --> 00:33.177
- Make it 5. Use your mulligan.
- That was 6 with my mulligan.

00:33.948 --> 00:36.981
You gotta go to the driving range
with me more often.

00:37.212 --> 00:39.448
You don't car pool on Tuesdays,
right?

00:39.740 --> 00:42.390
I think a car full of screaming
8-year-olds arguing...

00:42.651 --> 00:45.586
...over who's got shotgun
is less aggravating than this.

00:45.851 --> 00:47.062
Okay, hang on.

00:47.324 --> 00:48.501
Straighten up your back.

00:48.763 --> 00:50.651
Keep your head down.
I'll watch your ball.

00:58.748 --> 01:00.341
You're on the fairway.

01:00.635 --> 01:02.457
Wrong fairway,
but you're in the fairway.

01:02.684 --> 01:06.361
I think it's this whole doctor-golf
clich Á that's really throwing me.

01:06.620 --> 01:09.140
You can't fight it.
Play nine holes twice a week...

01:09.435 --> 01:13.177
...and 18 on the weekends.
You'll be in the low 80s by Labor Day.

01:14.812 --> 01:17.594
Dr. Benton, I see you have
a thymectomy scheduled.

01:17.883 --> 01:20.272
Would you mind if I gave it
to Dr. Levin?

01:20.891 --> 01:21.654
Yes, I would.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.428
Drs. Fecteau and Loesch are looking
for a Resident to assist them.

01:25.659 --> 01:28.048
- On a transplant?
- A 35-year-old with lupus.

01:28.316 --> 01:30.999
Her brother's donating a kidney.
You may like the opportunity.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.299
Yes, I would.

01:33.531 --> 01:35.571
Dr. Carter can scrub in
on the thymectomy.

01:35.836 --> 01:36.818
Sure.

01:37.244 --> 01:38.770
Unless, of course...

01:39.868 --> 01:42.617
...the transplant team
could also use Dr. Carter?

01:45.371 --> 01:48.633
Perhaps Dr. Carter could assist
the donor's team. I'll ask.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.800
Dr. Benton, thanks!
It means a lot to me that you'd...

01:52.060 --> 01:54.034
Carter, I'll see you up there, okay?

01:58.395 --> 02:00.086
Jeanie, it's after 7.

02:00.667 --> 02:01.845
Oh, my God!

02:02.108 --> 02:04.791
- Did my alarm ring?
- Every 10 minutes for the last hour.

02:05.051 --> 02:06.578
- My 7:00...
- Pills.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.401
That's why I woke you.

02:09.019 --> 02:10.743
I can't believe I overslept.

02:12.251 --> 02:15.034
Here's some juice and toast
to take with it.

02:16.027 --> 02:17.969
You take AZT first, right?

02:18.236 --> 02:20.821
Then I can take my nine o'clocks
on an empty stomach.

02:21.820 --> 02:25.202
Thanks for letting me stay.
And for not asking why.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.328
Sure.

02:28.284 --> 02:31.545
I didn't wanna be alone, or
feel like calling anyone else.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.036
I'm glad you called.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.889
A minor meltdown, you know?

02:37.563 --> 02:40.792
I was doing great, then out
of the blue, it snuck up on me.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.737
Yeah. I forget sometimes
for a couple of hours.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.719
- Then I remember.
- What's that?

02:46.428 --> 02:49.526
They're playing around with my meds.
The good news is...

02:49.756 --> 02:53.334
...if I start the day with this,
I can work in my Oreos at bedtime.

02:54.139 --> 02:55.895
You haven't outgrown the Oreos?

02:56.955 --> 02:57.883
Hell, no!

02:59.483 --> 03:01.785
Why are they adding meds?
Is your viral load up?

03:02.075 --> 03:03.058
I'm fine.

03:05.851 --> 03:07.673
I gotta be on the job in an hour.

03:07.931 --> 03:09.590
You wanna walk to the El together?

03:09.851 --> 03:11.793
Al, how are you doing?

03:13.243 --> 03:15.218
You know. It seems...

03:15.483 --> 03:17.588
...I'm resistant to something
or other.

03:18.779 --> 03:21.561
What about those new drugs?
The nucleoside analogues?

03:22.748 --> 03:26.741
My docs are trying to get me into
a trial study for those.

03:27.227 --> 03:29.169
They only take 20 people.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.354
Why didn't you tell me?

03:33.339 --> 03:34.932
It's not your problem.

03:35.195 --> 03:37.945
I might be able to help.
I do know some doctors.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.436
I didn't wanna bother you.

03:40.955 --> 03:43.672
Maybe I can get you an interview.
Where's the study?

03:44.283 --> 03:45.330
At County.

03:46.203 --> 03:50.131
Some docs who work in
Infectious Disease are running it.

03:52.827 --> 03:53.775
It's a hassle.

03:54.428 --> 03:55.540
No, no.

03:56.956 --> 03:58.101
It's a simple request.

03:58.683 --> 04:00.788
- Are you sure?
- No problem.

05:00.027 --> 05:01.521
- Oh, my God!
- I told you.

05:01.819 --> 05:03.608
"She reached to hang
his banana bag...

05:03.867 --> 05:06.288
...her breasts swelling
under her uniform.

05:06.555 --> 05:10.265
'Carly.' His voice hoarse with desire.
'Call me Nurse... Hallonan"'?

05:10.491 --> 05:11.669
Carly Hallonan. That's you.

05:11.931 --> 05:14.070
Read about the "gentle giant"
at the desk.

05:14.331 --> 05:15.792
You didn't mind he was Neanderthal?

05:16.059 --> 05:17.466
More brawn than brains.
A dude!

05:17.723 --> 05:20.243
- Who wrote this trash?
- Randi. It was under the desk.

05:20.539 --> 05:23.288
Maybe Lydia. She had a poem
in <i>Good Housekeeping</i> once.

05:23.547 --> 05:26.613
It was definitely written by a woman.
No man thinks like this.

05:26.844 --> 05:29.494
Listen to this: "Witchcraft
attracted her as a child...

05:29.755 --> 05:31.860
...when Zulu tribesmen
on her father's preserve...

05:32.156 --> 05:33.912
...tried to heal her shriveled leg."

05:34.172 --> 05:35.764
- Weaver's in it?
- You're cruel.

05:36.027 --> 05:38.777
"Now she aimed her spells at
fellow Attending, Martin Bean.

05:39.035 --> 05:41.937
She nightly stirred and whispered
in jealousy and, yes...

05:42.171 --> 05:44.626
...perhaps a perverted yearning."
- Yikes!

05:44.891 --> 05:47.989
- We should be careful.
- People's feelings could get hurt.

05:48.251 --> 05:50.258
- How many copies should I make?
- A lot.

05:50.523 --> 05:52.433
That LOL in Curtain 1 is
still waiting.

05:52.699 --> 05:53.528
I'll get it.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.048
- Water cannot wash away prophecy.
- We'll still start with a shower.

05:57.307 --> 06:00.090
Those who minister to the anointed
must shun the flesh of pigs.

06:00.348 --> 06:02.290
Refuse the carnal touch of any man.

06:02.555 --> 06:04.181
No meat, no men. I'm your woman.

06:04.443 --> 06:07.312
And all we know
will crumble unto dust...

06:07.611 --> 06:08.920
Doyle, did you call Psych?

06:09.147 --> 06:11.864
- Don't play into their delusions.
- I told the truth.

06:12.091 --> 06:13.553
The world is delusion!

06:13.851 --> 06:16.851
And truth shall rain upon thee
with fists of thunder!

06:17.115 --> 06:20.083
- Okay, let's go take a bath.
- Rejoice, lost man.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.355
Chaos is your destiny!

06:22.619 --> 06:25.619
- I am the prophet of evil.
- I'll be in Curtain Area 1.

06:29.148 --> 06:31.122
Good. I thought I was late.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.227
You are. Dr. Coburn's later.

06:36.859 --> 06:38.004
How you doing?

06:39.099 --> 06:41.074
I'm glad to be out of the house.

06:41.371 --> 06:43.444
How was the cab ride?
I would've picked you up.

06:43.675 --> 06:45.715
The cab ride was fine.
I'm fine, Peter.

06:45.979 --> 06:48.019
And the Lamaze class?
You rescheduled it?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.520
I did, but I won't need you
to be there.

06:51.451 --> 06:52.629
You're fired.

06:53.659 --> 06:54.520
What do you mean?

06:55.068 --> 06:58.483
Peter, I cannot work with you.
The way you bark orders at me?

06:58.747 --> 07:00.570
"Twenty seconds! Blow!"
Please!

07:05.115 --> 07:06.938
This baby's not gonna wanna come out.

07:07.196 --> 07:09.334
Carla, look, I didn't make up
the drills.

07:09.659 --> 07:13.008
Well, I am planning on a birth,
not a military maneuver.

07:13.531 --> 07:14.993
Folks, I'm sorry...

07:15.291 --> 07:17.462
...but Dr. Coburn's been called
into delivery.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.863
She'll be delayed at least
another hour.

07:20.123 --> 07:20.919
Damn!

07:21.915 --> 07:24.435
Peter, it's okay.
I know you're working.

07:24.699 --> 07:26.838
I wanted to ask her
about your iron supplement.

07:28.571 --> 07:29.814
Go save a life.

07:33.243 --> 07:34.770
I'll call you later, okay?

07:37.915 --> 07:39.257
Look at all the typos.

07:39.483 --> 07:41.784
- You think I'd do something so sloppy?
- Sorry.

07:42.075 --> 07:45.075
I'm going to Rachel's school.
I'll be back before noon.

07:45.339 --> 07:48.307
It's only in a couple inches of water.
He puts on his waders.

07:48.539 --> 07:50.000
But you're still sitting sweet.

07:50.267 --> 07:51.729
Two-under after 15.

07:51.963 --> 07:54.483
Is Doug's fellowship
in question again?

07:54.779 --> 07:57.114
He's angling an invite
to play golf at Fair Oaks.

07:57.371 --> 08:00.404
- Anspaugh's a member there.
- Dr. Ross has gone to the dark side.

08:00.699 --> 08:02.455
Help! I need help!

08:02.715 --> 08:04.242
- I'm looking for the ER.
- You found it.

08:04.507 --> 08:06.841
My daughter's leg was cut with a saw.
She's bleeding.

08:07.067 --> 08:09.239
I'm Dr. Greene, come this way.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.189
Tell Doyle to meet us in Trauma 1.

08:11.451 --> 08:13.273
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am soon.

08:13.531 --> 08:16.663
- It's not that bad.
- This is why girls shouldn't take shop.

08:16.891 --> 08:19.509
- It was Jim Rentschler who did it.
- I'll take a look.

08:19.739 --> 08:21.649
- I got your message.
- No need to come down.

08:21.947 --> 08:24.019
My pleasure. I called last night.

08:24.283 --> 08:26.356
I got in late.
I need to ask a favor.

08:26.683 --> 08:27.413
Shoot.

08:27.675 --> 08:31.570
Dr. Kramer in the AIDS clinic is doing
a trial study of nucleoside analogues.

08:31.835 --> 08:33.395
Are they looking for subjects?

08:34.619 --> 08:35.993
Having trouble with your meds?

08:36.283 --> 08:37.972
No, I'm fine. Knock wood.

08:38.427 --> 08:40.216
That's a relief.
Wanna have dinner?

08:40.475 --> 08:41.423
I can't.

08:41.851 --> 08:44.184
You'll tell me if I should
stop asking.

08:44.603 --> 08:46.807
I'd like to recommend someone
for the trial.

08:47.099 --> 08:49.554
I'll get your patient an interview
and flag their file...

08:49.819 --> 08:51.160
...if they fit the protocol.

08:51.387 --> 08:53.754
That's wonderful.
But it's not a patient.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.320
Actually, it's my ex, Al.

08:57.659 --> 08:59.066
I'll get him an interview today.

08:59.931 --> 09:00.661
Thanks.

09:03.195 --> 09:06.163
Irrigate. D Ábride. Single layer
closure with 4.0 nylon.

09:06.427 --> 09:08.915
Sounds right.
You're lucky it didn't cut deeper.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.284
- Was she talking about stitches?
- Right.

09:11.547 --> 09:14.580
- You're in good hands with Dr. Doyle.
- You're going someplace?

09:14.939 --> 09:17.306
- I'm not on duty.
- You're leaving us with a student?

09:17.563 --> 09:18.937
Dr. Doyle is an intern.

09:19.163 --> 09:22.775
Another Attending will consult
with her if there are any problems.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.693
I don't want an intern.

09:24.923 --> 09:26.931
I don't want her
to have a scar on her leg.

09:27.227 --> 09:28.372
Am I gonna have a scar?

09:28.635 --> 09:30.642
- A small one.
- But I'm a majorette!

09:31.003 --> 09:32.464
Get a plastic surgeon here!

09:32.762 --> 09:36.210
We don't consult plastic surgeons
for lacerations of this kind.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.745
For God's sakes, don't stick us
with a student!

09:39.003 --> 09:41.010
I'm an Emergency Medicine Resident.

09:41.275 --> 09:44.439
- You're learning on the job, dear.
- This is a teaching facility.

09:44.699 --> 09:48.561
If you wanna investigate a plastic
surgeon on your own, that's your right.

09:48.827 --> 09:50.038
Like I can afford that.

09:50.331 --> 09:53.233
Dr. Doyle is fully qualified
for this kind of repair.

09:53.499 --> 09:57.208
- I'm running late, so I'm leaving now.
- You're not the only one leaving.

09:57.435 --> 09:58.612
Alyssa, get your shoes on.

09:58.971 --> 10:01.841
Her injury may mean nothing to you,
but if it were your kid...

10:02.107 --> 10:03.416
...you'd make sure she got the best.

10:03.675 --> 10:07.058
- Whatever you think, Mr. Gunther.
- Great! Just walk away!

10:07.355 --> 10:10.072
- I owe you one, Kerry.
- Don't worry. I got it.

10:12.507 --> 10:13.849
Will this put me to sleep?

10:14.139 --> 10:16.987
No, this is just for IV access,
Mr. Twomey.

10:17.243 --> 10:19.283
They won't start anesthesia
until you get to O.R.

10:19.515 --> 10:23.224
Good. I was hoping I could
see my sister before I went under.

10:24.219 --> 10:26.423
It's a great thing you're doing,
giving her a kidney.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.436
She practically raised me.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.936
Our family wasn't too interested.

10:31.739 --> 10:33.397
Then she got lupus.

10:33.915 --> 10:36.697
She's been through so much,
with dialysis and all.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.284
Hang on, this might be her.
Jean Twomey?

10:40.027 --> 10:41.336
Someone here wants to see you.

10:41.786 --> 10:43.729
Oh, my God!

10:44.539 --> 10:48.216
He's gonna bug me until
the last minute, isn't he?

10:48.506 --> 10:49.521
If I can.

10:50.363 --> 10:51.770
Change of heart, crybaby?

10:52.027 --> 10:53.042
Of course not.

10:53.691 --> 10:56.080
I already offered him
my stereo in a trade.

10:56.347 --> 10:59.663
A stereo for a kidney? You'll
have to throw in the Jet Ski too.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.907
Okay. As long as that settles it...

11:02.203 --> 11:05.432
...and I'm not beholden to my
kid brother for the rest of my life.

11:05.691 --> 11:07.381
Does this sound fair to you?

11:08.314 --> 11:09.263
Fair and square.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.212
All right, it's a deal, then.

11:12.602 --> 11:13.682
Deal.

11:16.827 --> 11:19.674
- You're going to be with my brother?
- I sure am.

11:20.507 --> 11:22.995
Well, take care of him.
He's a wimp.

11:28.826 --> 11:31.543
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a head doctor.

11:31.771 --> 11:32.534
Which one?

11:32.795 --> 11:34.737
Bald white guy with little glasses?

11:35.003 --> 11:36.977
Dr. Greene's not here.
What do you need?

11:37.243 --> 11:39.731
A few weeks ago
he took care of my brother.

11:40.219 --> 11:41.593
Now I got this.

11:43.611 --> 11:45.204
You'll have to take this to...

11:45.467 --> 11:47.856
...the 3rd floor, past reception,
to the east wing.

11:48.155 --> 11:49.529
They can help you there.

11:50.747 --> 11:51.675
Thank you.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.159
The secret to putting,
since you didn't ask...

11:55.387 --> 11:56.696
...is to change your focus.

11:56.987 --> 12:00.532
These machines are for idiots. Anyone
can sink the same shot over and over.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.355
I'm getting hooked on this.

12:02.619 --> 12:04.212
I think Randi has a hidden talent.

12:04.442 --> 12:06.198
She says she didn't write it.

12:06.715 --> 12:09.465
A nurse didn't write it.
Nurses go home too tired to write.

12:09.723 --> 12:11.316
Maybe a doctor did.

12:12.603 --> 12:14.196
The medicine's too cheesy.

12:14.459 --> 12:15.920
She has got you down.

12:16.187 --> 12:18.870
"The suave Resident cocked his head
boyishly and winked.

12:19.131 --> 12:21.553
A quick wink.
Almost a reflex.

12:21.851 --> 12:23.956
She trembled,
her resolve crumbling."

12:24.187 --> 12:24.983
Who's he winking at?

12:26.363 --> 12:27.705
My character, who's he winking at?

12:28.027 --> 12:30.482
A lot of these characters
are just made up.

12:31.322 --> 12:32.697
- There you are.
- How are you?

12:32.923 --> 12:34.745
I'm glad to see you're not swamped.

12:35.035 --> 12:36.791
- I need your help.
- Absolutely.

12:37.051 --> 12:39.058
- Do you mind?
- No. Here, go ahead.

12:40.155 --> 12:42.359
I just got a phone call
from a friend of mine.

12:42.619 --> 12:44.724
P. K. Palmer of
the railroad Palmers?

12:44.987 --> 12:45.935
Sure, yeah.

12:47.163 --> 12:47.959
Damn it.

12:49.562 --> 12:51.450
I know P. K. From the club,
of course.

12:51.707 --> 12:53.976
He's a hell of a guy.
A 2 handicap.

12:55.930 --> 12:58.581
- This floor must be sloped.
- Yeah. It slopes.

12:58.843 --> 12:59.639
Anyhow...

12:59.930 --> 13:02.930
...P. K. Called from Hilton Head.
He's there with his missus.

13:03.195 --> 13:06.457
Seems their little one stayed home
with a nanny and took a spill.

13:06.715 --> 13:07.729
Could be a fracture.

13:07.962 --> 13:11.126
Their pediatrician's out of town.
He asked me for a referral.

13:11.387 --> 13:13.591
- Have his nanny bring him.
- They're on their way.

13:13.851 --> 13:15.444
There we go. Right in the heart.

13:16.858 --> 13:18.419
The parents are flying home now.

13:18.683 --> 13:20.919
I promised them their son
would get the best.

13:21.179 --> 13:22.739
I'll take good care of him.

13:23.259 --> 13:25.593
If you're interested,
you couldn't ask for...

13:25.883 --> 13:28.665
...a better recommendation
to Fair Oaks than P. K.'s.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.631
Yeah. I hadn't thought of that.

13:33.243 --> 13:37.367
Fair Oaks is one of the 25
best courses in the country.

13:37.659 --> 13:39.569
Really? You could
take me as your guest.

13:39.803 --> 13:42.388
- You don't play golf.
- That's a good thing...

13:42.651 --> 13:45.139
...because they don't allow women.
Or blacks.

13:45.402 --> 13:47.791
- Jews either.
- I think they changed that.

13:48.059 --> 13:50.066
I'm pretty sure they changed that.

14:00.699 --> 14:03.666
Chris Law. My brother was Kenny.

14:03.898 --> 14:04.946
I remember. How are you?

14:05.306 --> 14:06.484
Not so good.

14:07.322 --> 14:09.144
My mother got this yesterday.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.496
A $ 19,000 bill from a hospital
that killed her son.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.762
My mother doesn't have insurance.

14:17.147 --> 14:20.824
- I'm sure the billing department...
- Will make a payment schedule?

14:21.082 --> 14:22.741
They don't understand that...

14:23.227 --> 14:26.543
...my mother, who pays every bill,
won't pay one penny of that.

14:26.971 --> 14:28.629
She's not gonna pay because...

14:28.891 --> 14:30.898
...I'm telling her
that it's a mistake.

14:31.195 --> 14:33.780
You don't get bills
from people who kill your child.

14:34.139 --> 14:38.416
You don't pay people who lose his body
between their morgue and a coroner...

14:38.683 --> 14:41.465
...so that you have to postpone
a funeral for two days.

14:42.394 --> 14:44.849
I'm sorry.
I had no idea that happened.

14:45.115 --> 14:46.871
Nobody has any idea.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.532
But you tell them...

14:48.795 --> 14:52.057
...that she doesn't get another
piece of mail from this hospital...

14:52.315 --> 14:53.973
...unless it's an apology.

14:56.315 --> 14:58.071
I'm very sorry for your loss.

15:00.059 --> 15:01.652
I'm not threatening to sue.

15:02.906 --> 15:05.427
I'm sure you have a department
for that too.

15:07.643 --> 15:10.360
But if my mother gets another bill
from this hospital...

15:11.098 --> 15:13.367
...maybe I'm gonna kick some ass.

15:13.659 --> 15:15.285
Maybe I'll start with yours.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.098
I'd report it to Security.

15:22.362 --> 15:24.729
He was blowing off steam.
He had a good point.

15:24.986 --> 15:27.091
The morgue did mix up
the body transfer.

15:27.355 --> 15:28.762
- How's Rachel?
- Good news.

15:29.019 --> 15:31.158
She's Marco Polo in the school play.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.839
- Save me a seat.
- There's no chocolate chip.

15:34.075 --> 15:35.220
Aren't you with me?

15:35.515 --> 15:38.384
Lydia is. One RN per collarbone,
even for the country club set.

15:38.619 --> 15:41.718
- Who gets the VIP treatment?
- I get yogurt for kids who wait.

15:42.010 --> 15:43.254
All right.

15:43.834 --> 15:47.544
Got some chocolate yogurt for
the big guy with the sore clavicle.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.744
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.701
You wanna see why it hurts?

15:51.962 --> 15:53.009
Here. Hop down.

15:54.171 --> 15:56.058
Will you get ice and a sling, Lydia?

15:56.347 --> 15:57.492
Be right back.

15:58.363 --> 16:00.916
There's his anomalous
left renal vein...

16:01.595 --> 16:03.984
...posterior to the aorta.

16:04.315 --> 16:06.005
Can you see that, Dr. Carter?

16:07.419 --> 16:09.939
We're standing by.
Houston, do you read me?

16:10.235 --> 16:11.445
Loud and clear.

16:12.059 --> 16:13.750
This is very cool.

16:15.674 --> 16:16.754
Our first time on intercom.

16:17.019 --> 16:21.296
We usually have a nurse running back
and forth between donor and recipient.

16:22.746 --> 16:25.135
- Ready for countdown, Fin?
- Ready and waiting.

16:25.530 --> 16:26.839
Clock starts.

16:27.098 --> 16:29.554
Why does it become interesting now,
Dr. Carter?

16:30.043 --> 16:32.498
You want to monitor
your ischemic time.

16:32.731 --> 16:33.494
Bingo.

16:33.979 --> 16:35.353
I'm lifting the kidney out.

16:37.211 --> 16:38.258
Basin, please.

16:38.554 --> 16:40.659
Ever pass the baton in a relay?

16:40.890 --> 16:42.352
I ran the 440 in high school.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.057
Good. Perfuse it.

16:45.211 --> 16:46.738
Good. That's it.

16:47.546 --> 16:48.561
Well, Dr. Carter...

16:49.499 --> 16:50.546
...don't get lost.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.910
Dr. Carter's bringing the kidney
your way.

16:55.419 --> 16:56.367
Oh, my God!

16:56.635 --> 16:57.715
Problem, Dr. Benton?

16:58.555 --> 17:00.311
No, not at all.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.163
Somebody wanna sign for this?

17:02.939 --> 17:03.866
What's your name?

17:04.122 --> 17:04.983
John Carter.

17:05.434 --> 17:08.750
Why don't you scrub in?
You can join us for the second act.

17:09.563 --> 17:10.609
Great.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.614
Do you see this line right here?

17:18.874 --> 17:20.151
Come here. Take a look.

17:20.858 --> 17:22.549
See that? You know what that is?

17:22.778 --> 17:26.259
That is your first broken bone.
You're officially a man.

17:26.521 --> 17:28.889
I let him talk me out of
bringing him last night.

17:29.146 --> 17:31.732
- He said it didn't hurt.
- He's such a tough guy.

17:31.995 --> 17:35.093
He didn't wanna get in trouble.
He shouldn't be out after dark.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.362
It's tough to stay in
when it's this warm.

17:37.915 --> 17:39.289
My mom says I'll get hurt.

17:39.546 --> 17:42.099
- She does? What does your dad say?
- I'm a klutz.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.850
- He does?
- He gets a lot of bumps and scrapes.

17:45.146 --> 17:47.350
His father's quite an athlete,
you know?

17:47.611 --> 17:48.985
Do you fall down a lot?

17:49.594 --> 17:52.725
I'm not supposed to let him
run around without watching.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.823
Let's play a game.
I'll cover my eye. You do the same.

17:57.563 --> 17:59.221
You cover your own eye.

18:01.018 --> 18:04.280
Tell me if you can see my finger.
Tell me when you see it.

18:05.466 --> 18:07.222
Don't look.
Look straight ahead.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.330
Cover your eye.

18:15.418 --> 18:17.011
- See it?
- I see it.

18:18.523 --> 18:19.253
Good.

18:24.058 --> 18:26.098
Let's try the other eye, okay?

18:31.130 --> 18:32.657
So you found it, huh?

18:32.923 --> 18:34.417
- I did.
- How much have you read?

18:34.843 --> 18:37.690
I got past the part where
the "alpha-bitch Attending"...

18:37.946 --> 18:40.018
...goes to a faith healer
to cure her limp.

18:41.338 --> 18:43.858
The seduction scene after that
is really hot.

18:44.634 --> 18:46.642
I don't think whoever wrote it
was being mean.

18:46.906 --> 18:49.841
It's a tongue-in-cheek romance.
You gotta take it that way.

18:50.138 --> 18:52.473
- Sounds like you got into it.
- It's a hoot.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.258
I think it's meant to be.

18:56.762 --> 18:57.624
Kerry, you wrote it.

18:57.978 --> 18:59.353
- I did not.
- You did too.

18:59.578 --> 19:00.756
Why waste my time?

19:01.019 --> 19:02.001
For the money.

19:02.235 --> 19:04.406
There's a big market
for this kind of thing.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.856
- Too bad I didn't write it.
- Hey, somebody!

19:08.155 --> 19:09.016
I need help now!

19:10.714 --> 19:13.464
- Is this the ALOC 57 called in?
- He had a stroke.

19:13.722 --> 19:15.348
- Why aren't you in uniform?
- Day off.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.520
It's okay, Gramps. You'll be okay.

19:17.818 --> 19:20.501
- Take it easy, Pam.
- He had a stroke. I know it.

19:20.762 --> 19:23.217
We had stroke training last week.
I did the SAS test.

19:23.451 --> 19:25.556
- Slow down.
- He's got one-sided weakness.

19:25.850 --> 19:28.436
I went to take him shopping.
I always go on my day off.

19:28.698 --> 19:29.626
Give me the bullet.

19:29.882 --> 19:33.111
73-year-old African-American male,
ALOC, slurred speech.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.510
- Loss of motion on left side.
- He's never sick.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.363
- Vitals?
- BP 175 over 100.

19:37.626 --> 19:39.448
I didn't have a cuff.
Pulse was 140.

19:39.738 --> 19:42.007
- When did you find him?
- 20 minutes ago.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.688
We were closer to Mercy,
but Pam insisted on coming here.

19:44.954 --> 19:47.093
I knew you'd set up
a stroke treatment program.

19:47.355 --> 19:48.183
Call Dr. Greene.

19:48.698 --> 19:51.993
- How's the time, Dr. Carter?
- You're at 43 minutes.

19:52.538 --> 19:55.320
And anastomosis is completed.

19:55.610 --> 19:58.577
Dr. Benton, why don't you
move the DeBakey clamps?

19:58.810 --> 20:00.501
Can everybody see in here?

20:02.971 --> 20:04.280
It's pinking up.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.814
Look at that.

20:07.194 --> 20:08.372
That's what I live for.

20:08.635 --> 20:10.042
The sight of urine flowing.

20:10.299 --> 20:11.760
We got trouble in here.

20:12.026 --> 20:13.619
- What?
- Donor's hemorrhaging.

20:14.106 --> 20:15.513
He's tachycardic.

20:15.770 --> 20:17.079
Sounds like a tie slipped.

20:17.402 --> 20:19.158
- Renal artery?
- That'd be my guess.

20:19.387 --> 20:22.485
Let's open him up. He's losing
blood fast. Get me a tonsil clamp.

20:22.746 --> 20:25.528
Let's stay in the game.
We gotta close here.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.362
That ophthalmologist has messages.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.733
- He's finishing up.
- Opthamologist?

20:32.027 --> 20:34.296
You're giving him
the million-dollar workup.

20:34.522 --> 20:35.253
What do you mean?

20:35.515 --> 20:38.362
If you're a Palmer,
you get the full treatment here.

20:39.386 --> 20:42.899
Would I put a kid through unnecessary
tests to impress his family?

20:43.162 --> 20:44.242
I guess not.

20:44.794 --> 20:47.096
Retinitis pigmentosa.
He's going blind.

20:47.354 --> 20:49.493
- I was afraid of that.
- Getting hurt at night?

20:49.755 --> 20:51.991
His parents will want to hear
the options.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.362
Possible brain attack?

20:53.658 --> 20:56.025
Yes. This is
Paramedic Olbes' grandfather.

20:56.250 --> 20:59.479
Let's get a CBC, PT, PTT,
platelet count...

20:59.770 --> 21:01.744
...fibrinogen, type and cross 4 units.

21:01.978 --> 21:03.866
Team's on alert.
Malik, record the BP.

21:04.122 --> 21:07.089
Stick of glucose. Alert Radiology
that we're coming in...

21:07.354 --> 21:09.045
...for a noncontrast head CT.

21:09.306 --> 21:10.616
BP's 185 over 110.

21:10.842 --> 21:13.395
IV labetalol 15 mgs.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.348
Sir, do you know where you are?

21:15.642 --> 21:17.267
- Can you help him?
- What's his name?

21:17.530 --> 21:19.156
Everybody calls him Gramps.

21:19.771 --> 21:22.192
Gramps, can you tell me what happened?

21:24.923 --> 21:27.770
Sir, can you squeeze my hand?
Can you squeeze?

21:29.082 --> 21:32.148
- Did he complain of headaches?
- No. I talked to him last night.

21:32.442 --> 21:33.587
Nausea? Vomiting?

21:33.819 --> 21:36.339
Is your grandfather
on any medications?

21:36.602 --> 21:38.991
- Does he take aspirin?
- No. He hates pills.

21:39.258 --> 21:40.535
Are you gonna give him TPA?

21:41.722 --> 21:43.129
That's what he needs, right?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.109
We're trying to assess that.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.548
Do you know when the symptoms began?

21:47.259 --> 21:48.568
Do you know anybody who might?

21:48.827 --> 21:51.314
Maybe his neighbor.
They walk together in the morning.

21:51.578 --> 21:52.855
Can you give him a call?

21:53.306 --> 21:54.419
Go! Go.

21:54.650 --> 21:58.098
- CT's ready for us.
- All right. Let's get him upstairs.

21:58.362 --> 22:00.697
I was afraid of this
with the stroke team.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.986
People heard of a miracle cure.
They don't understand the risks.

22:04.218 --> 22:05.200
I understand the risks.

22:05.466 --> 22:08.313
I've seen patients hemorrhage
with TPA. It's no cure-all.

22:08.602 --> 22:10.391
That's why we follow protocol.

22:10.618 --> 22:12.527
The results aren't convincing.

22:12.794 --> 22:14.452
I understand you have reservations.

22:14.714 --> 22:17.016
That's why I'm on the team
and you're not.

22:17.275 --> 22:20.341
Fine. But if she can't clarify the
onset of symptoms...

22:20.602 --> 22:22.937
I'd be a fool to give TPA.

22:29.690 --> 22:30.967
It's just an interview.

22:31.194 --> 22:33.082
They'll ask me
a bunch of nosy questions.

22:33.339 --> 22:35.477
They have to be sure they
have reliable candidates.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.592
That's what makes me nervous.

22:38.778 --> 22:40.207
I don't deserve this help.

22:40.506 --> 22:42.808
Everyone deserves help
from their friends.

22:43.034 --> 22:44.441
Friends, huh?

22:44.698 --> 22:48.179
It reminds me of when we first met
before we even started dating.

22:48.442 --> 22:50.035
We were never friends.

22:50.298 --> 22:52.753
I always had my eye on you,
wondering when I'd make my move.

22:53.018 --> 22:55.800
See? You're a good liar.
You'll do fine on the interview.

22:56.186 --> 22:58.008
CT confirms an ischemic stroke.

22:58.266 --> 23:02.008
Gramps' neighbor verified that
he had no symptoms two hours ago.

23:02.330 --> 23:04.785
So he's easily within the
180-minute range.

23:06.618 --> 23:09.171
If you're looking for my blessing
on this, forget it.

23:09.434 --> 23:12.696
I was hoping you'd talk to Olbes.
She's heard from the neurologist...

23:12.986 --> 23:16.499
...and from me that we think her
grandfather is a candidate for TPA.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.835
I'd like her to hear the risks
from you.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.710
I happen to believe that he'll
respond to thrombolysis.

23:22.970 --> 23:24.944
But if I'm wrong, he could die.

23:25.242 --> 23:26.671
She needs to hear that clearly.

23:26.906 --> 23:27.953
You want me to tell her?

23:28.250 --> 23:31.633
Who better than a respected colleague
on the other side of the fence?

23:32.186 --> 23:34.870
- I suspect you won't soft-pedal it.
- I won't.

23:36.026 --> 23:36.954
Thank you.

23:45.434 --> 23:46.612
How's he doing?

23:46.842 --> 23:50.225
It looks like they got the bleeding
under control. They're closing.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.352
This is a first.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.746
Usually he's had a shower
before I get finished.

23:55.386 --> 23:58.321
Would you gentlemen care to join us
for the postgame wrap-up?

23:58.586 --> 24:02.230
We find that debriefing can be useful
when there's been a complication.

24:02.522 --> 24:04.344
Yes. We'd be honored.

24:04.634 --> 24:07.634
You had a call from Carla Reece.
Would you like the number?

24:07.866 --> 24:10.005
- I got it. Carter, you coming?
- Shirley?

24:10.298 --> 24:14.128
Can you call Recovery? Ask them to
page me when Jean Twomey wakes up?

24:14.395 --> 24:15.256
Sure.

24:15.578 --> 24:19.091
Dr. Kramer, I was wondering
if I could interview this candidate.

24:20.410 --> 24:22.003
Al Boulet? You know him?

24:22.266 --> 24:26.456
I'm familiar with his treatment.
I'm curious to see what he's like.

24:26.810 --> 24:27.988
Be my guest.

24:29.658 --> 24:33.367
I'm Dr. Fischer. Thanks for taking
the time to fill out all these forms.

24:33.658 --> 24:36.276
I thought I was meeting a Dr. Kramer.

24:36.538 --> 24:38.131
I'm helping him out.

24:38.426 --> 24:40.401
All the information looks complete.

24:40.634 --> 24:43.667
You mentioned some slip-ups
with your drug regimen in the past.

24:43.962 --> 24:46.482
So many pills to keep track of.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.534
I've got it under control now.

24:48.794 --> 24:50.682
- You began treatment a year ago?
- Right.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.466
You contracted AIDS through...?

24:53.434 --> 24:55.409
Heterosexual contact, I guess.

24:55.674 --> 24:59.319
I mean, since I never shot up
or had sex with a guy.

25:01.594 --> 25:03.983
You couldn't identify the
partner who infected you?

25:05.914 --> 25:09.297
I contacted all the women I could
to let them know.

25:09.658 --> 25:11.895
No one had any prior infection.

25:12.506 --> 25:16.302
But it was a lot of years
and a lot of women.

25:17.562 --> 25:19.187
- Now you live alone?
- Right.

25:19.930 --> 25:23.126
That factor mitigates
against your inclusion in the trial.

25:23.546 --> 25:25.815
Participants must adhere
to a strict regimen.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.533
Participants should have
someone to back them up.

25:29.242 --> 25:30.387
I'm sure I can handle it.

25:32.761 --> 25:33.907
And I have backup.

25:34.138 --> 25:36.342
My ex-wife is around...

25:36.634 --> 25:37.681
...off and on.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.752
- Off and on?
- A lot, recently.

25:42.010 --> 25:46.200
I mean, she's kind of back in my life.
Stays over and all.

25:46.490 --> 25:48.824
She's a physician assistant.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.470
She'll keep on me.
Make me stick to it.

25:51.706 --> 25:52.437
I see.

25:53.594 --> 25:56.594
Once Jeanie takes something on,
she doesn't mess around.

26:00.378 --> 26:02.200
Ten mgs TPA over one minute.

26:02.490 --> 26:05.785
Follow with 50 milligrams
over the next hour.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.912
For a total dosage of 60 mgs.

26:10.138 --> 26:14.033
Monitor his vital signs and maintain
a diastolic of under 110.

26:14.298 --> 26:15.508
Now we wait?

26:15.930 --> 26:17.042
Now we wait.

26:20.474 --> 26:23.605
In retrospect, studying Mr. Twomey's
renal angiogram...

26:23.898 --> 26:25.970
...we might have predicted
a problem.

26:26.202 --> 26:28.722
With the angiogram
and a crystal ball, maybe.

26:28.986 --> 26:30.710
Look at the short renal vein.

26:30.969 --> 26:33.173
Do you appreciate that, Dr. Benton?

26:35.417 --> 26:38.581
- I think he's being hard on himself.
- How did we do on ischemic time?

26:38.842 --> 26:40.435
- We can do better.
- Lf you weren't...

26:40.698 --> 26:43.960
...so chintzy with the ureter.
Give me something to work with.

26:44.218 --> 26:45.647
Let's go step by step.

26:45.946 --> 26:47.222
I lost time dividing the vein.

26:47.450 --> 26:50.003
Our biggest deviation
was anastomosis...

26:50.266 --> 26:51.695
...21 minutes.

26:52.122 --> 26:53.300
What are you saying?

26:53.594 --> 26:55.733
She denied it,
but I could tell it was true.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.784
I bet she wrote it on that
free time.

26:58.042 --> 27:00.082
When she was on suspension.

27:00.474 --> 27:04.369
Did you get that history from
the abdominal pain in Exam 2?

27:10.298 --> 27:12.305
- What?
- You little slut.

27:13.658 --> 27:15.152
I see you in a whole new light.

27:15.418 --> 27:16.465
We know you wrote it.

27:17.978 --> 27:18.926
I didn't write it.

27:19.258 --> 27:20.818
You ought to be proud of it.

27:21.274 --> 27:23.413
Kerry, did you tell...
She wrote the book.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.852
Nice try.

27:25.146 --> 27:27.382
- I'd make myself the villain?
- I knew it was you.

27:28.058 --> 27:29.073
I didn't do it!

27:29.338 --> 27:30.864
- You thought it was Jeanie.
- Or Carol.

27:31.097 --> 27:33.781
I knew it was an incurable romantic
who was warped.

27:34.042 --> 27:35.503
I'm not warped.

27:38.810 --> 27:40.239
This is cool.

27:40.506 --> 27:43.026
Watch it. The big spinout, baby!

27:45.338 --> 27:46.964
Hit the button.
Hit the "down" button.

27:47.258 --> 27:48.186
Hop off.

27:48.442 --> 27:51.703
I know you've been given a lot of
information. This is a tough time.

27:51.994 --> 27:54.449
There are a lot of new interventions.

27:54.714 --> 27:57.048
P. K.'s doctor will be able
to fill you in on those.

27:57.273 --> 28:00.405
- I like Dr. Ross.
- We all do, sweetie.

28:00.698 --> 28:03.382
I like you too.
Make sure you keep these glasses on.

28:03.610 --> 28:04.471
Okay?

28:05.722 --> 28:06.649
Where's your sweater?

28:06.938 --> 28:08.399
I know where I left it.

28:08.666 --> 28:10.008
Let's get that sweater.

28:12.666 --> 28:17.041
One thing to be careful about is that
he doesn't feel like he's been bad.

28:17.306 --> 28:19.640
Sometimes kids with RP feel
like it's their fault.

28:20.442 --> 28:22.002
We'll be careful of that.

28:22.266 --> 28:24.600
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

28:24.857 --> 28:26.581
- Thank you.
- Bye, you guys. See you.

28:27.834 --> 28:29.492
No holding you back.

28:31.034 --> 28:34.863
Some people think of RP
as looking through a telescope.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.481
- I owe you an apology.
- Forget it.

28:38.714 --> 28:41.397
I have no reason
to question your integrity.

28:41.689 --> 28:43.216
As a doctor, at least.

28:43.834 --> 28:45.623
Everything's so glib with you
these days.

28:45.881 --> 28:47.704
I don't know what matters to you.

28:47.962 --> 28:49.555
- Me, either.
- Great job, Carol.

28:49.817 --> 28:51.922
- Did you know she wrote the book?
- Are you kidding?

28:52.218 --> 28:53.527
She stole the idea from me.

28:53.754 --> 28:56.056
I did not write the damn book!

28:57.753 --> 28:59.095
Welcome back.

29:02.649 --> 29:03.860
You're doing well.

29:04.154 --> 29:07.798
Why isn't Carl here?
Nobody will tell me anything.

29:08.026 --> 29:10.098
- He's still under anesthesia.
- Why?

29:10.329 --> 29:12.947
- What went wrong?
- Your brother's fine.

29:13.242 --> 29:17.617
There were some complications, some
bleeding. They had to open him again.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.462
I was afraid of something like this.

29:22.074 --> 29:24.408
He's stabilized. He's fine.

29:24.633 --> 29:26.389
I wouldn't tell you
if it wasn't true.

29:26.649 --> 29:29.016
I'll see if they can move him here
with you.

29:29.274 --> 29:31.347
I'll stay with him until
he wakes up.

29:33.690 --> 29:34.835
Great.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.560
- Any response?
- Not yet.

29:36.857 --> 29:39.279
- Seen Dr. Greene?
- You just missed him.

29:41.626 --> 29:45.619
Dr. Ross? I'd like you to meet
a new Resident, Anna Del Amico.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.604
- This is our Pedes Fellow.
- My pleasure.

29:47.866 --> 29:48.597
Mutual.

29:49.434 --> 29:50.896
So you're starting early?

29:51.161 --> 29:53.845
I'm doing a Pedes elective
before my Residency starts.

29:54.106 --> 29:55.731
We always welcome slave labor
in Pedes.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.685
I'll show you around.

29:57.946 --> 29:59.669
Dr. Del Amico is a pediatrician.

29:59.930 --> 30:01.872
She's double-boarding
in Emergency Medicine.

30:02.138 --> 30:05.204
What we need around here,
more overachievers.

30:06.810 --> 30:07.825
There you are.

30:08.793 --> 30:11.379
Can you believe it?
I'm getting out of here on time.

30:11.610 --> 30:15.920
Al qualifies for the trial. He should
read over this, then pick up his meds.

30:16.217 --> 30:17.199
Shouldn't you tell him?

30:17.466 --> 30:20.881
We left a message, but I figured
you'd probably see him first.

30:21.146 --> 30:22.455
Greg, what's going on?

30:22.714 --> 30:25.463
I've been asking myself that
for the last two months.

30:25.721 --> 30:27.477
I thought I was honest with you.

30:27.737 --> 30:31.218
That I understood the reasons you'd
be hesitant about getting involved.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.976
I guess I missed one.

30:33.274 --> 30:35.445
You're still involved with
your ex-husband.

30:35.673 --> 30:38.575
After how he treated you, he
still uses you to get him meds.

30:38.874 --> 30:41.841
- He didn't manipulate me.
- But you do still love him?

30:45.082 --> 30:45.878
I don't know.

30:58.873 --> 31:01.426
- Dr. Greene, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

31:02.649 --> 31:06.479
Did you ever think Carol Hathaway
might be interested in me at all?

31:06.745 --> 31:08.633
Did you ever pick up on anything?

31:09.529 --> 31:11.634
No, I can't say that I have.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.889
- Have you read her book?
- What book?

31:18.330 --> 31:19.758
Carol wrote a book.

31:21.753 --> 31:25.049
There's some parts about me
that are pretty flattering.

31:27.065 --> 31:29.138
Did she say anything about me?

32:30.425 --> 32:32.760
It seems a little amateurish.

32:33.209 --> 32:36.558
- I was impressed.
- I didn't read much. A few pages.

32:36.858 --> 32:38.483
You gotta give it a chance.

32:45.466 --> 32:47.735
Didn't you think Carol's
book was pretty decent?

32:47.961 --> 32:50.417
The part I read was racist.
Don't tell Carol I said that.

32:50.681 --> 32:53.529
- You didn't like the Latina nurse?
- It wasn't real.

32:55.033 --> 32:58.230
I didn't think the ethnic characters
were handled any differently.

32:58.490 --> 33:01.806
Have you seen Mark?
Gramps' blood pressure is going up.

33:02.074 --> 33:05.140
That's a good sign. No,
I was looking for him too.

33:10.810 --> 33:11.987
Look who's here.

33:17.305 --> 33:18.287
You did it.

33:20.537 --> 33:21.398
You did it.

33:21.690 --> 33:24.472
Okay, no fighting. I did it.

33:25.178 --> 33:26.258
Dr. Carter?

33:31.705 --> 33:33.331
They're doing really well.

33:33.593 --> 33:36.463
- Where did you go?
- To make sure they saw each other.

33:36.986 --> 33:40.368
Two of the best transplant surgeons
let us look over their shoulders...

33:40.634 --> 33:43.983
...debriefing on the most fascinating
procedure we've participated in...

33:44.249 --> 33:46.159
...and you just get up and leave.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.044
I promised the sister.
I knew she'd be worried.

33:53.145 --> 33:53.974
Is that a problem?

33:56.602 --> 33:57.333
I don't know.

33:57.881 --> 33:59.190
Another message from Carla Reece.

33:59.449 --> 34:03.759
- It's okay. I got her machine.
- She left an extension. OB, I think.

34:14.009 --> 34:17.074
Will you take Dr. Del Amico back?
I'm intimidated enough already.

34:17.370 --> 34:19.541
- Anna, please.
- All right, Anna. Welcome.

34:19.768 --> 34:20.817
Did you find a place yet?

34:21.081 --> 34:23.797
I don't know Chicago.
I thought I'd look this weekend.

34:25.433 --> 34:26.513
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, my God!

34:26.714 --> 34:27.728
- It's Mark!
- What happened?

34:28.025 --> 34:29.433
Stabilize his neck.

34:29.657 --> 34:31.828
- Where do I find a C-collar?
- I'll get it. Help Doug.

34:32.697 --> 34:33.646
Hold his neck.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.335
In-line stabilization.
I got it.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.248
- Good breath sounds.
- Is he an ER doc?

34:39.545 --> 34:41.650
Attending.
Give me the collar, please!

34:43.768 --> 34:45.710
- Get the board ready.
- Slowly, slowly, slowly.

34:48.442 --> 34:49.619
Here we go.
We'll roll him.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.442
- Easy.
- First roll him towards me.

34:51.705 --> 34:52.982
Let's roll him.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.288
- Slide the board in.
- Be gentle.

34:55.545 --> 34:56.887
That's fine, right there.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.567
Okay, roll him back. Go, roll.

35:00.377 --> 35:01.621
Gently.

35:03.225 --> 35:05.265
You're gonna be okay.
Now hang in there.

35:05.529 --> 35:06.871
Let's get him monitored.

35:07.130 --> 35:09.683
Cross-table C-spine, chest CBC,
type and hold.

35:09.945 --> 35:12.847
On my count we'll lift him.
Nice and gentle.

35:13.146 --> 35:14.771
Real slow. All right, Malik?

35:15.033 --> 35:16.048
One, two...

35:16.282 --> 35:17.689
...three. Go.

35:20.249 --> 35:21.842
Alert CT.

35:22.842 --> 35:26.071
- He's vomiting. Watch for aspirations.
- Let's roll him!

35:27.898 --> 35:30.134
What's going on?
Oh, my God! Mark!

35:30.361 --> 35:33.231
Pulse is 120. Resps 24.
BP's 100 over 60.

35:33.497 --> 35:35.570
- What happened?
- We need to put on a mask.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.201
- 15 liters.
- We need to rule out pneumothorax.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.530
Chuny, aren't you with
the stroke team?

35:40.825 --> 35:43.214
Go back to your patient.
Go on!

35:43.449 --> 35:45.588
- Come on!
- Now! Get back there.

35:46.681 --> 35:49.681
Pupils are round and sluggish,
react to light.

35:49.913 --> 35:51.255
Possible hyphema.

35:51.546 --> 35:52.855
DTR's 2-plus, bilaterally.

35:53.081 --> 35:55.023
- Babinski's negative.
- Radiology's on the way.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.783
Oh, my God, it's true!

35:57.017 --> 36:00.050
- We got crunchy ribs here.
- I'll get the bleeding under control.

36:00.346 --> 36:02.484
- Who are you?
- New Resident.

36:03.385 --> 36:05.457
Guarding and tenderness.
Abdominal CT?

36:05.850 --> 36:08.533
You bet. Give him the works.
Come on!

36:08.793 --> 36:11.444
She was in my office
when the contractions started.

36:11.706 --> 36:14.356
Her membrane hasn't ruptured,
and the baby isn't in distress.

36:14.617 --> 36:16.406
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.

36:16.666 --> 36:18.389
I admitted her.
I put her on bed rest.

36:18.649 --> 36:21.071
With luck, we can keep her
from going into labor.

36:21.562 --> 36:23.667
- Thank you, Dr. Coburn.
- You're welcome.

36:31.162 --> 36:33.333
Dr. Coburn said they stopped the
contractions.

36:35.673 --> 36:36.851
You mind if I sit?

36:41.785 --> 36:44.654
You pretty much
have to stay like this?

36:46.361 --> 36:48.117
Exactly like this.

36:48.377 --> 36:49.839
For eight weeks.

36:51.289 --> 36:52.783
Can I get you anything?

36:54.714 --> 36:56.208
No, just sit there.

36:56.953 --> 36:57.968
And entertain me.

37:01.593 --> 37:02.967
Never mind.

37:03.194 --> 37:04.176
What?

37:06.009 --> 37:07.765
You know, I was...

37:08.858 --> 37:10.646
...wondering about it...

37:11.738 --> 37:14.291
I think I know when this baby
was conceived.

37:17.017 --> 37:17.748
Me too.

37:18.617 --> 37:19.599
Really?

37:20.313 --> 37:21.874
Oh, yeah. Really.

37:22.137 --> 37:23.566
You remember that morning?

37:30.426 --> 37:32.597
Seems like a long time ago.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.696
Yeah, it does.

37:40.890 --> 37:44.119
Possible side effects: Bloating,
nausea, sustained diarrhea...

37:44.378 --> 37:47.574
Stop reading that.
I don't have a single vice left.

37:47.833 --> 37:52.143
Forget beer. Sometimes I'd double my
viral load for a glass of milk.

37:52.410 --> 37:54.035
I don't mind the soy stuff.

37:55.257 --> 37:57.264
Well, you were always a pushover.

37:57.497 --> 37:58.577
Yes, I was.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.227
And I took it for granted.

38:06.009 --> 38:07.536
You know what I miss most about us?

38:08.601 --> 38:10.095
Hearing you laugh.

38:13.305 --> 38:15.193
The sound of you laughing in the dark.

38:17.753 --> 38:19.379
We both took a lot for granted.

38:22.649 --> 38:24.624
I don't take anything for granted
anymore.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.128
I'd better go.

38:47.705 --> 38:48.720
Sure.

38:50.425 --> 38:52.497
Or stay on the couch if you want.

38:52.761 --> 38:54.768
I don't wanna stay on the couch.

38:56.026 --> 38:56.887
Then you better go.

38:57.177 --> 38:59.316
- I'll stay on the couch.
- Me too.

39:07.769 --> 39:10.420
- Wait. Can you stay right there?
- I doubt it.

39:11.609 --> 39:13.038
I'll be right back.

39:13.753 --> 39:16.274
I don't have a condom
that's not over a year old.

39:16.538 --> 39:18.064
And I have to have one, right?

39:20.473 --> 39:21.717
You're right.

39:22.169 --> 39:26.260
I could have a different strain than
you. And we need to be safe.

39:28.377 --> 39:30.516
I'll be two minutes. Will you wait?

39:30.777 --> 39:32.054
I'll try.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.088
That's it.

39:37.785 --> 39:39.247
That's what I missed.

39:48.985 --> 39:50.229
CT's negative.

39:50.521 --> 39:51.350
He was lucky.

39:51.609 --> 39:53.332
Gotta get Ortho
to look at that hand.

39:53.593 --> 39:55.535
- I'll see what's keeping him.
- Any change?

39:55.801 --> 39:57.142
And nobody saw anything?

39:57.401 --> 39:59.790
I told the cops that basketball
player's brother was around.

40:00.057 --> 40:01.966
A psych guy threatened
Dr. Greene this morning.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.858
The cops will want
to hear about that.

40:05.273 --> 40:07.575
The kid with the allergic reaction
is in Exam 2.

40:08.986 --> 40:10.774
- I'll take it.
- You don't have to do that.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.651
- Can you rustle me up a lab coat?
- I'll find you one.

40:15.354 --> 40:17.044
It's usually not this crazy here.

40:17.561 --> 40:18.489
Not a problem.

40:18.681 --> 40:20.176
Can you check this out?

40:20.473 --> 40:21.651
I'll be back.

40:21.913 --> 40:24.532
Keep working, people.
We still got an ER to run.

40:25.657 --> 40:28.341
- What about Rachel?
- The sitter's gonna keep her tonight.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.658
He had a response a few minutes ago.

40:32.921 --> 40:34.645
His speech is coming back.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.655
Something is wrong.

40:37.945 --> 40:39.701
Yeah, Gramps. You had a stroke.

40:39.993 --> 40:41.487
You're gonna be better now.

40:42.937 --> 40:45.076
I couldn't do that...

40:47.705 --> 40:49.265
He's being admitted upstairs.

40:49.497 --> 40:51.832
I guess Dr. Greene
made the right call.

40:53.465 --> 40:54.894
I want to thank him.

40:55.961 --> 40:59.310
I'll tell him for you.
He'll be very pleased.

41:04.473 --> 41:07.320
- GCS is still 13.
- I know.

41:07.897 --> 41:09.424
You just checked 10 minutes ago.

41:09.657 --> 41:11.315
- How's his IV rate?
- Fine.

41:11.577 --> 41:13.781
- Don't want to overhydrate.
- I cut it back.

41:14.041 --> 41:17.140
You have him on 80 cc's an hour.
He weighs about 80 kilos...

41:17.465 --> 41:19.407
Why don't you
find out what's keeping Ortho?

41:19.673 --> 41:21.496
I'm bugging you that much?

41:22.649 --> 41:25.432
- I guess I'll call Ortho.
- That's a good idea.

41:34.233 --> 41:35.574
He's back.

41:37.881 --> 41:39.572
Hey, Mark.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.557
You're gonna be fine.

41:42.425 --> 41:43.472
Hi, buddy.

41:44.921 --> 41:45.685
What happened?

41:48.025 --> 41:52.148
You got beat up. But you're okay.
You got bruised ribs and a concussion.

41:52.825 --> 41:55.126
Midshaft fractures
and two metacarpals.

41:56.249 --> 41:59.446
Other than that, you're fine.
I signed you up for a double Saturday.

42:06.073 --> 42:07.120
What happened?
