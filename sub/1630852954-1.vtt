WEBVTT

00:45.413 --> 00:48.282
Woman: LOOK.

00:48.316 --> 00:51.419
WE'RE GONNA GO SMOKE.
WANT TO COME?

00:51.452 --> 00:53.587
UM, NO, THANKS.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.593
Woman:
WE'LL BE BACK.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.137
( waves crashing )

01:19.180 --> 01:21.315
( camera whirring )

01:38.566 --> 01:40.834
( woman whimpering )

01:50.178 --> 01:51.479
( screams )

01:59.787 --> 02:01.855
( whimpering )

02:07.861 --> 02:09.663
SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST IN THE CAR.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.332
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, MIKE,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.700
LISTEN, I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.468
NOTHING HAPPENED.
SHE JUST GOT MAD.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.671
- OH, SHE GOT MAD? GOT?
- YEAH, GOT.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.341
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK
OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER.
YOU'RE APOLOGIZING.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.410
- FINE, WHATEVER.
- YOU GUYS...

02:34.655 --> 02:36.690
( screams )

02:46.400 --> 02:48.536
Woman:
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT
THERE ARE OTHERS OUT HERE

02:48.569 --> 02:51.805
WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME
KINDS OF EXPERIENCES,

02:51.839 --> 02:55.276
WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH
THE SAME KIND OF FEELINGS.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.845
IT CAN BE VERY HARD
TO RELATE TO PEOPLE

02:57.878 --> 03:01.582
ABOUT A SUICIDE
IN THE FAMILY.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.584
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED

03:03.617 --> 03:07.321
TO TALK TO PEOPLE
WHO UNDERSTAND.

03:07.355 --> 03:10.591
THERE ARE SOME FEELINGS
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE,

03:10.624 --> 03:13.261
EVEN YOUR
VERY BEST FRIENDS,

03:13.294 --> 03:15.663
ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO RELATE TO.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.466
WELL,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.868
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A COUPLE OF NEW
PEOPLE HERE TODAY,

03:20.901 --> 03:24.572
BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE A COUPLE OF THEM
COULDN'T QUITE MAKE IT.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.574
SO WE ONLY HAVE ONE--

03:26.607 --> 03:29.310
ONE NEW LINK
IN OUR CHAIN.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.912
WHAT WE USUALLY DO
WHEN WE HAVE A NEW MEMBER

03:31.945 --> 03:34.582
IS A SELF-INTRODUCTORY
TYPE OF THING.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.717
OKAY.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.952
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.324
UM...

03:43.357 --> 03:45.826
MY NAME IS ANGELA.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.761
HI, ANGELA.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.464
Angela:
AND...

03:55.403 --> 03:58.439
I GUESS
THE REASON I'M HERE

03:58.472 --> 04:00.441
IS BECAUSE--

04:00.474 --> 04:02.810
( door opens )

04:11.385 --> 04:12.886
HI.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.056
ARE YOU BRIAN?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.325
YEAH.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.503
CONTINUE.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.651
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
TAKE THE BUS?

04:43.684 --> 04:45.386
WHAT?

04:45.419 --> 04:46.954
OH, NO.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.457
I DO IT SOMETIMES
TO SAVE MONEY ON GAS.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.492
OH.

04:53.661 --> 04:57.030
I USED TO ALWAYS
HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.599
I HATED IT.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.434
IT MADE ME REALLY
ANXIOUS, YOU KNOW?

05:00.468 --> 05:03.704
I FELT LIKE I WAS
GONNA MISS MY STOP.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.739
I ALWAYS GOT NERVOUS THAT
I WAS GONNA MISS MY STOP.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.342
IT'S REALLY STRESSFUL.
BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE

05:08.376 --> 05:10.478
IT'S-THE-LEAST-I-CAN-DO
SORT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW--

05:10.511 --> 05:12.680
RIDING THE BUS,
THAT IS.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.418
WHY WERE YOU LATE?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.689
MISSED THE BUS.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.324
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.995
I JUST WAS, I GUESS.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.036
MY NAME IS BRIAN.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.039
I KNEW THAT ALREADY.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.875
OH, YEAH.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.412
YOU'RE ANGELA.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.580
I KNEW THAT ALREADY ALSO.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.690
WHO WAS IT?

05:59.627 --> 06:01.695
MY DAD.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.698
YOU?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.967
MY MOM.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.603
I'M SORRY.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.511
WELL, GOOD LUCK
ON THE BUS, ANGELA.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.912
DON'T GET LOST, OKAY?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.648
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.651
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT TIME?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.853
I'M PROBABLY
NOT GOING BACK AGAIN
IF I CAN HELP IT.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.489
YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO
EITHER.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.623
REALLY?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.825
NO.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.494
- WELL...
- I MEAN, I GUESS.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.162
I DON'T KNOW,
I HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.698
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT OUR SORROWS
ELSEWHERE THEN?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.066
LIKE WHERE?
LIKE ONLINE?

06:39.099 --> 06:42.135
NO, DEFINITELY
NOT ONLINE.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.438
WELL, NOT LIKE A DATE,
RIGHT?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.974
JUST OUT.
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.876
NO. ARE YOU?

06:48.909 --> 06:53.747
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
ASKING YOU IF I WERE, RIGHT?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.916
( alarm beeping )

06:57.851 --> 06:59.887
( dog barking )

07:02.923 --> 07:04.925
( alarm stops )

07:21.809 --> 07:24.512
- HEY, BRENT.
- MORNING, ANGELA.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.814
HOW'S THE SECURITY
BUSINESS?

07:33.754 --> 07:36.557
SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.497
( rock music playing )

07:48.969 --> 07:51.772
THANKS FOR HELPING US OUT, IAN.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT OF YOU.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.645
ANGELA, HI.

07:57.678 --> 08:01.715
HI, MR. LOPES.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU HAD
CLASS OR SOMETHING.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.250
NO, I'M JUST HERE
FOR YOU.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.586
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS SO SPECIAL.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.588
NO, I MEAN

08:07.621 --> 08:09.923
I SCHEDULED THIS
MEETING WITH YOU

08:09.957 --> 08:12.059
BECAUSE I NEED
TO KNOW

08:12.092 --> 08:14.895
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.297
I KNOW.
I'M TRYING TO GET--

08:17.330 --> 08:18.532
DO YOU WORK?

08:18.566 --> 08:20.934
NO, I DON'T.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.739
JUST TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU, ANGELA,

08:25.773 --> 08:27.675
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PASS
THIS CLASS

08:27.708 --> 08:30.043
THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.045
IT'S NOT THE QUALITY
OF YOUR WORK.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.582
YOU'RE NOT TOO STUPID
FOR THIS CLASS.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.850
IT'S JUST THAT

08:36.884 --> 08:38.752
YOU DON'T
TURN ANYTHING IN.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.990
AT THE SAME TIME,
I CAN'T CUT YOU ANY SLACK

08:43.023 --> 08:44.958
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
GIVEN ME A REASON

08:44.992 --> 08:47.628
TO CUT YOU ANY SLACK,
YOU KNOW?

08:47.661 --> 08:50.631
I-- I DON'T KNOW.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.133
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST--

08:57.070 --> 08:59.039
( exhales )
MY GOD.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.108
UM...

09:01.141 --> 09:05.679
MY MOTHER DIED
REALLY RECENTLY.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.815
UM...

09:07.848 --> 09:09.917
SHE WASN'T OLD
OR ANYTHING.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.919
SHE...

09:11.952 --> 09:14.888
KILLED HERSELF.

09:16.089 --> 09:21.194
AND, YOU KNOW, MY DAD'S,
LIKE, NOT IN MY LIFE.

09:21.228 --> 09:25.298
WE'RE SORT OF
NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.303
I'M SORRY.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.805
IT'S OKAY.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.107
I CAN SYMPATHIZE.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.744
I LOST MY DAUGHTER BETH
RECENTLY.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.712
SHE HAD TONSILLITIS,

09:38.746 --> 09:41.014
YOU KNOW, WHICH USUALLY
ISN'T VERY SERIOUS,

09:41.048 --> 09:46.086
BUT THINGS JUST KIND OF--
THEY WENT WRONG.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.989
AND SHE-- SHE LEFT US.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.625
AND SHE WAS NINE--

09:51.659 --> 09:54.194
NINE YEARS OLD.
IT WAS REALLY HARD.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.929
I'M SO SORRY.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.132
SO I CAN UNDERS--
I UNDERSTAND.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.969
I UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE
REALLY REALLY HARD.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.106
WELL...

10:06.139 --> 10:09.276
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME

10:09.309 --> 10:11.779
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, OKAY?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.114
I GUESS I CAN CUT YOU
A LITTLE SLACK NOW.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.787
COME HERE.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.200
- BAD?
- NO, IT'S ANNOYING.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.335
- WHAT DID YOU GET?
- B-MINUS,

10:35.368 --> 10:37.204
WHICH IS SO STUPID.
I HATE THAT GUY.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.807
IF I HAD TO FIND
A NEW ROOMMATE,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.942
I WOULD NEVER PUT UP
ONE OF THESE ADS.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.978
THEY'RE SO WEIRD.
AREN'T THEY WEIRD, ANGE?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.348
UM, I WOULD NEVER
ANSWER ONE.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.751
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WEIRD.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.053
WELL, THE REASON WHY
YOU WOULDN'T ANSWER ONE
IS 'CAUSE THEY'RE SO WEIRD.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.755
I GUESS.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.323
( dials )

10:56.356 --> 11:00.794
PEOPLE PUT SOME
CRAZY STUFF UP HERE.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.068
OH MY GOD.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.003
WHAT?

11:10.037 --> 11:11.271
YOUR MESSAGE.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.273
I THOUGHT YOU
ALREADY GOT THAT.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.975
NO.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.711
I KNOW.
IT'S SO SAD.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.781
GOD, WHEN DID
THIS HAPPEN?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.817
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
AT THE BEACH.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.726
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WITH KATHERINE,
THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

11:34.061 --> 11:37.030
( quiet music playing )

11:53.080 --> 11:55.048
HEY.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.117
HOW WAS WORK?

11:58.986 --> 12:01.822
HOW WAS WORK?

12:01.855 --> 12:04.157
FUCKING AMAZING.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.493
HOW WAS SITTING ALONE
IN THE APARTMENT?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.461
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I DID TODAY?

12:08.495 --> 12:11.932
I BOUGHT CIGARETTES
AND WENT TO THE BANK.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.768
DID YOU ROB THE BANK?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.770
NO.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.106
PITY.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.843
I'M GONNA GO CHANGE.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.146
YOU GOT SOMETHING TODAY.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.129
THERE'S NO ADDRESS ON IT.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.164
SOMEONE MUST HAVE, LIKE,
DROPPED IT OFF OR SOMETHING.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.372
( woman humming
a tune )

13:42.990 --> 13:45.558
( guests chattering )

15:01.601 --> 15:04.004
( whistle blows )

15:14.547 --> 15:16.549
( gunshot )

15:41.508 --> 15:43.676
I JUST HEARD.

15:43.710 --> 15:48.281
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

15:48.315 --> 15:50.984
SHE WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.256
OH, HONEY,

15:56.289 --> 15:59.259
WHAT IS IT?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.694
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME,
YOU KNOW--

16:01.728 --> 16:04.231
THERE'S STATISTICS--

16:04.264 --> 16:07.134
EVERYWHERE.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.668
I KNOW.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.239
MORE PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES
THAN EACH OTHER.

16:12.272 --> 16:16.276
THERE'S MORE SUICIDES
THAN HOMICIDES.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.679
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS, ANGELA?

16:21.548 --> 16:24.651
YOU CAN'T BE ALONE.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.288
YOU'RE SAFER LIVING
WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER

16:28.321 --> 16:30.723
THAN WITH YOURSELF.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.128
YOU CAN'T RUN
FROM YOURSELF, THOUGH.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.632
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.814
ANGELA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.550
I'M SORRY, GARRETT--
I MEAN, MR. LOPES.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.420
I CAN'T REALLY STAY,
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO STOP BY.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.489
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:02.522 --> 17:06.159
I JUST-- I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET MY--

17:06.193 --> 17:08.495
I MEAN, MAYBE,
BUT I DON'T THINK

17:08.528 --> 17:10.497
THAT I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO GET

17:10.530 --> 17:12.499
YOUR INTRO PARAGRAPH
IN ON TIME.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.436
THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.505
WELL, THANK YOU FOR
LETTING ME KNOW, ANGELA.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.308
SURE, YEAH.
I MEAN, I'LL JUST TRY

17:21.341 --> 17:23.410
AND EMAIL IT TO YOU
WHEN I GET A CHANCE
OR SOMETHING--

17:23.443 --> 17:25.312
SOON, I MEAN.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.314
JUST GET IT TO ME
WHEN YOU CAN.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.150
THANKS.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.392
I NEVER KNOW IF WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO WAIT FOR THE CHECK
OR GO UP TO THE FRONT.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.761
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.132
OH, WELL, YEAH.
BUT I MEAN AT PLACES
LIKE THIS, I GUESS.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.334
I DON'T KNOW.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.636
( quiet music playing )

17:49.669 --> 17:51.671
CHECK, PLEASE.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.641
WHAT?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.376
YOU GO ON LOTS OF DATES,
DON'T YOU?

17:56.409 --> 17:57.744
YOU DON'T?

17:57.777 --> 18:00.380
WELL, NO.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.818
LET'S JUST SAY

18:05.852 --> 18:08.288
FOR THE SAKE OF,
I DON'T KNOW--

18:08.321 --> 18:09.722
SAY THAT--

18:09.756 --> 18:11.358
OKAY, LET'S SAY...

18:11.391 --> 18:13.860
...THAT YOU WERE
ON A DATE RIGHT NOW.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.628
- RIGHT THIS MOMENT?
- RIGHT THIS MOMENT.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.830
- WITH YOU?
- WITH ME

18:17.864 --> 18:19.899
OR ANYONE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.601
OKAY.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.503
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
RIGHT NOW?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.272
WELL, HMM.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.775
I WOULD PROBABLY TRY
TO GET TO KNOW YOU

18:28.808 --> 18:30.143
OR HER,

18:30.177 --> 18:34.814
SO I MIGHT ASK,
I DON'T KNOW--

18:34.847 --> 18:36.716
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE--?
- CHINESE.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.385
I THOUGHT
IT WASN'T YOU.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.852
WHAT'S YOURS?

18:39.886 --> 18:41.688
ITALIAN.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.256
WELL, THEY HAD PASTA.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.424
I DON'T LIKE PASTA.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.526
BUT YOUR FAVORITE
FOOD'S ITALIAN?

18:46.559 --> 18:49.496
THAT'S WEIRD.

18:49.529 --> 18:54.267
NO, THAT'S AN INTERESTING
FACT ABOUT ME--

18:54.301 --> 18:57.337
A FACT THAT MIGHT
MAKE YOU THINK

18:57.370 --> 19:00.540
THAT I AM A UNIQUE
AND INTERESTING PERSON.

19:00.573 --> 19:04.644
AND YOU ARE
THE ONLY PERSON HERE

19:04.677 --> 19:06.646
THAT KNOWS THAT ABOUT ME
AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.749
AND THAT IS WHAT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU LIKE ME.

19:10.717 --> 19:14.354
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.622
OKAY.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.958
UM, LET'S SEE...

19:18.991 --> 19:21.561
OH, MY MOM AND I
USED TO SEND

19:21.594 --> 19:23.330
MESSAGES IN A BOTTLE,
LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.598
WHAT WERE THE MESSAGES?

19:25.632 --> 19:27.934
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.536
I WISH I DID.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.571
DID YOU PUT YOUR
CONTACT INFORMATION ON THEM?

19:31.604 --> 19:32.905
SHUT UP.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.907
YOU'RE MAKING FUN
OF MY INTERESTING FACT.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.510
DO YOU STILL DO IT--
I MEAN, SEND A MESSAGE?

19:37.544 --> 19:41.514
NO, AFTER MY MOM DIED
I JUST GOT SO MAD AT HER

19:41.548 --> 19:43.783
THAT I NEVER WENT BACK
TO THE BEACH.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.519
IT'S LIKE IT CHEATED ME
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

19:46.553 --> 19:48.888
MAYBE IF YOU
FORGAVE HER--

19:48.921 --> 19:50.523
I DON'T WANT TO.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.326
YOU SHOULD.
IT'S BETTER.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.528
( music stops,
applause )

19:57.297 --> 19:59.566
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
CAN I ASK THAT?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.769
SHE SLIT HER THROAT.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.871
OH MY GOD. WOW.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.440
YEAH, I KNOW.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.876
IN THE KITCHEN.
I FOUND HER.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.245
I'M SORRY.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.847
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

20:16.383 --> 20:18.518
HE PUT HIS HEAD
IN THE OVEN.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.287
I DIDN'T THINK
PEOPLE REALLY DID THAT.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.589
ME NEITHER.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.591
DID SHE LEAVE A NOTE?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.759
NO.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.895
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,
YOU KNOW.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.830
DOCTORS ARE SUPPOSED
TO HELP PEOPLE.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.300
MY DAD WAS A DOCTOR

20:33.333 --> 20:35.302
AT HUNTER GENERAL.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.571
SAME WITH MY MOM.
MAYBE THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.308
- THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING OFF, YOU KNOW?
- WHAT?

20:41.341 --> 20:43.676
THEY DID IT AT THE SAME TIME,
BOTH DOCTORS.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.977
I DON'T KNOW.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.013
IT'S THE HOSPITAL.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.983
THAT PLACE MUST HAVE
DONE SOMETHING TO THEM.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.753
- MAYBE IF WE WENT--
- NO NO.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.323
YEAH, LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING OUT.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.924
I CAN'T GO THERE.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.428
I CAN'T GO TO THE PLACES
WHERE SHE'S BEEN.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.530
I CAN'T TOUCH THE THINGS
THAT SHE'S TOUCHED.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.632
I CAN'T.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.769
( insects chirping )

21:11.504 --> 21:14.541
IF I TELL YOU
SOMETHING,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.743
DO YOU PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.311
WHO WOULD I TELL?

21:18.345 --> 21:19.412
SERIOUSLY.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.780
OF COURSE.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.782
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.517
IT'S JUST--

21:24.551 --> 21:25.785
WHAT?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.754
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.322
WELL, YOU SHOULD
TELL ME.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.324
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL YOU

21:31.358 --> 21:33.460
BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU
THEN I'M MAKING IT
A BIG DEAL.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.595
AND IF I DON'T TELL YOU
IT'S LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.063
SO JUST FORGET IT.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.966
YOU SHOULD TELL ME.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.734
NO.

21:41.768 --> 21:45.538
FINE. DON'T.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.911
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
YOU KNOW.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.446
WHAT?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.548
SAY SOMETHING PROVOCATIVE
AND THEN NOT TELL ME.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.983
PROVOCATIVE?

21:57.016 --> 21:59.018
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.890
WHAT IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
THEN WILL YOU TELL ME?

22:03.923 --> 22:06.459
I GUESS SO.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.661
WHAT?

22:10.763 --> 22:12.865
I GOT--

22:12.899 --> 22:15.768
I GOT THIS TAPE.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.938
OF YOUR DAD?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.708
- YEAH.
- ME TOO, OF MY MOM.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.043
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW,

22:24.076 --> 22:25.978
BUT WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
VIDEOTAPE OUR PARENTS?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.614
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
DO THAT?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.516
I DON'T KNOW.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.719
ANGELA, I THINK--

22:32.752 --> 22:34.754
I THINK MAYBE
MY DAD DIDN'T--

22:34.787 --> 22:37.990
LIKE, MAYBE
SOMEBODY ELSE DID.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.859
WHAT?

22:39.892 --> 22:41.994
COME ON, LIKE
SOMEBODY KILLED HIM?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.030
IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME
ANY OTHER WAY.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.667
I GUESS I'M JUST
CONFUSED, YOU KNOW?

22:47.700 --> 22:50.603
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE--

22:50.637 --> 22:53.039
MAYBE SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO HELP US.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.744
LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA BE
FINE, OKAY?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.979
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

23:01.047 --> 23:04.684
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.456
I'M NOT REALLY USED TO
THIS SORT OF THING.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.691
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.760
THANKS.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.508
I SHOULD GO.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.649
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.158
I GET OFF WORK AT 7:00.
I'LL COME OVER.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.027
YEAH, OKAY.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.799
LOCK THE DOOR, OKAY?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.535
- SHUT UP.
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.537
OKAY, BYE.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.059
( man and woman
arguing )

24:33.673 --> 24:36.008
Brent:
YOU KNOW.
ARE YOU HAPPY?

24:36.042 --> 24:37.510
Woman:
SURE.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.913
"I'M OUT BOWLING
WITH THE BUDDIES, BABY."

24:40.947 --> 24:42.915
WHEN DID YOU PLAN
ON TELLING ME ALL THIS?

24:42.949 --> 24:44.917
SHUT UP, LISA.
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU

24:44.951 --> 24:46.753
EVERY FUCKING THING
THAT I DO.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.588
YOU KNOW, YOU BORE ME!

24:48.621 --> 24:49.822
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:49.856 --> 24:53.893
WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF
YOUR FUCKING HIGH HORSE?

24:53.926 --> 24:55.662
IT'S JUST
A FUCKING HOBBY.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.530
SURE, LIKE IT'S
SO HARD TO BELIEVE

24:57.564 --> 25:01.167
THAT I MIGHT WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MY HUSBAND DOES
IN HIS SPARE TIME.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.035
ARE YOU HAPPY?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.937
YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO MY LIFE.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.939
SHUT UP, LISA.
YOU SHUT UP.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.576
YOU FUCKING
SHUT YOUR HOLE.
SHUT UP.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.249
( water running )

25:53.052 --> 25:55.087
( distant dog barking )

28:24.470 --> 28:26.472
( gasps )

29:58.230 --> 30:00.933
( phone ringing )

30:40.606 --> 30:43.109
I JUST DON'T FEEL
SAFE HERE BY MYSELF.

30:43.142 --> 30:46.946
BABE, I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.948
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:48.981 --> 30:52.318
EVERYTHING IS
GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.520
I'LL STAY HERE
UNTIL BRIAN GETS HOME.

30:54.553 --> 30:58.891
AND WE'LL JUST WATCH A MOVIE
AND PAINT OUR NAILS.

30:58.925 --> 31:02.128
AND I'LL MAKE DINNER, OKAY?

31:02.161 --> 31:04.630
AND YOU'LL NEVER EVER EVER
HAVE TO BE ALONE AGAIN, OKAY?

31:04.663 --> 31:07.666
MY WIFE AND I WANT
TO GET BACK THERE
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.037
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
CITY YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.238
IS IT?

31:12.271 --> 31:14.040
IT'S JUST GORGEOUS.

31:14.073 --> 31:17.243
ARE YOU BACK IN SCHOOL
NOW, BRIAN?

31:17.276 --> 31:18.377
EXCUSE ME?

31:18.410 --> 31:21.113
- ARE YOU IN SCHOOL?
- NO.

31:21.147 --> 31:24.350
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I JUST REALLY HAVEN'T
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT

31:24.383 --> 31:26.285
TOO MUCH RECENTLY,
YOU KNOW?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.520
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

31:28.554 --> 31:30.990
I WANT TO DRIVE A TAXI.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.959
YEAH?

31:32.992 --> 31:34.393
A TAXI?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.362
I KNOW A GUY
WHO DRIVES A TAXI.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.165
I CAN GIVE YOU
HIS NUMBER.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.404
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE
REALLY GREAT.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.939
DEFINITELY GIVE ME
HIS NUMBER.

31:46.973 --> 31:49.141
YOU GOT IT.

31:58.617 --> 32:03.222
YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE
HERE YESTERDAY.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.024
DO YOU HAVE IT NOW?

32:05.057 --> 32:07.393
YEAH, IT'S ON THE TABLE.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.428
WHERE WAS IT?

32:09.461 --> 32:12.398
IN THE KITCHEN.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.666
OH, YEAH.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.269
I REMEMBER LEAVING IT
ON THE COUNTER.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.671
THAT IS, LIKE, THE THIRD TIME
I'VE HAD TO REPLACE THIS THING.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.440
THANKS FOR FINDING IT.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.675
NO PROBLEM.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.258
ALL RIGHT,
I'M TAKING OFF.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.194
OH. YOU GOT
A HOT DATE?

32:42.228 --> 32:44.130
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.533
I HAVE TO CATCH THE BUS.

32:47.566 --> 32:50.702
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, OKAY?

32:56.108 --> 32:58.244
( door opens
and closes )

33:09.255 --> 33:12.324
( car engine starts )

33:12.358 --> 33:15.227
( engine revving )

33:24.670 --> 33:28.274
( engine revving )

33:30.842 --> 33:35.114
( engine idling )

33:49.828 --> 33:51.697
( chuckles )

33:59.638 --> 34:01.707
( engine idling )

34:31.303 --> 34:33.339
( chuckles )

35:06.238 --> 35:08.574
( engine idling )

35:19.951 --> 35:22.188
( engine stops )

35:39.738 --> 35:41.740
( engine idling )

35:45.844 --> 35:47.846
( coughing )

37:02.654 --> 37:04.990
( coughing )

37:05.023 --> 37:07.493
( engine idling )

37:30.816 --> 37:32.951
ARE YOU SURE?

37:32.984 --> 37:35.721
BRIAN IS GONNA BE HERE
IN, LIKE, A MINUTE.
I'LL BE FINE.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.855
REALLY?

37:36.888 --> 37:38.056
YES, REALLY.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.560
BRIT, YOU'VE BEEN
REALLY GREAT.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.862
OH...

37:43.895 --> 37:47.433
OH, AND I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.335
PLEASE DON'T STAY
YOU'RE SORRY.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.837
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY SORRY.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.004
OKAY.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.706
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T SAY
SORRY TO ME AGAIN.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.475
BRIT, HE'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.044
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MEET HIM YET.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.580
ARE YOU TRYING
TO REPLACE ME?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.582
OF COURSE NOT.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.884
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.420
BYE BYE BYE BYE.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.036
( knocks on door )

38:31.377 --> 38:33.412
HI.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.587
I DIDN'T SEE THIS
THE FIRST TIME.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.889
IT WAS ON MINE TOO.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.392
THE SAME EXACT THING?

38:46.425 --> 38:47.559
YEAH.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.496
SO THAT'S YOUR DAD?

39:11.517 --> 39:13.985
ARE YOU MAD AT ME
FOR SOME REASON?

39:25.697 --> 39:28.600
- BABE.
- NO.

39:28.634 --> 39:31.537
WHAT IS GOING ON?

39:31.570 --> 39:33.805
I HATE THIS.
I'M TERRIFIED.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.141
MY LIFE IS TERRIFYING.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.677
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME
FOR ME TO BE ALONE.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.618
YOU'RE NOT.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.055
I KNOW.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.786
( distant dog barking )

42:12.931 --> 42:15.601
WHAT'S WRONG?

42:21.206 --> 42:24.610
IAN COMMITTED SUICIDE
LAST NIGHT.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.250
I DON'T THINK
HE DID IT.

42:32.283 --> 42:34.820
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

42:36.021 --> 42:39.157
HE SUFFOCATED HIMSELF
IN THE CAR.

42:44.630 --> 42:47.032
IT WASN'T EVEN
HIS HOUSE.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.671
GOD, THIS
FUCKING SUCKS.

42:56.141 --> 42:59.044
I THINK I KNOW
WHO TOOK THE PICTURE.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.715
HE USUALLY COMES BACK
FROM WORK RIGHT BEFORE
I GO TO SCHOOL.

43:03.749 --> 43:05.316
HE'S A SECURITY GUARD.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.185
WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?

43:07.218 --> 43:09.187
JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.789
OKAY, SO HOW LONG
DO WE HAVE?

43:10.822 --> 43:12.891
AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.362
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

43:17.395 --> 43:19.865
WE HAVE TO DO THIS, OKAY?
THERE'S NO BETTER TIME.

43:44.189 --> 43:46.658
I THINK THEY HAVE A KEY
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

44:12.818 --> 44:14.953
( whispers )
HEY, PUT THAT DOWN.

44:42.247 --> 44:44.049
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

44:44.082 --> 44:46.785
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

46:23.849 --> 46:25.851
( rustling )

46:28.386 --> 46:31.189
OH, YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

46:31.222 --> 46:32.958
YOU'RE ANNOYING.
WHAT ARE YOU--?

46:32.991 --> 46:35.393
- WHATEVER.
- WHATEVER.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.401
( fast-forwarding )

48:41.019 --> 48:42.553
( stops VCR )

48:42.587 --> 48:46.992
( car approaches )

48:47.025 --> 48:49.027
( engine stops )

48:50.361 --> 48:52.930
( car door closes )

48:57.002 --> 48:59.004
( doorbell rings )

49:55.560 --> 49:57.562
( clattering )

50:16.581 --> 50:20.185
( woman screaming )

50:22.153 --> 50:24.155
( doorknob rattles )

50:40.638 --> 50:43.541
( coughing )

51:12.670 --> 51:14.805
( coughing )

51:37.295 --> 51:39.197
( doorbell rings )

51:46.337 --> 51:49.274
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO
DISTRACT HIM OR SOMETHING.

52:00.485 --> 52:02.587
I JUST CAME BY TO TELL YOU
THAT I DON'T THINK

52:02.620 --> 52:05.690
I CAN COME BACK TO YOUR
CLASS RIGHT NOW.

52:05.723 --> 52:08.326
OKAY.

52:09.960 --> 52:11.796
- WHAT HAPPENED.
- I TOLD HIM.

52:11.829 --> 52:13.631
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM.
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

52:13.664 --> 52:15.300
ANGELA, OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.
NO ONE WILL.

52:15.333 --> 52:16.834
I THOUGHT HE WOULD.

52:16.867 --> 52:19.270
SWEETIE, LET'S GO
TO YOUR HOUSE, OKAY?

52:19.304 --> 52:20.838
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK THERE
RIGHT NOW.

52:20.871 --> 52:23.708
COULD WE PLEASE
JUST GO TO YOURS?

52:23.741 --> 52:25.710
OF COURSE.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.778
IT'S OKAY.

52:29.314 --> 52:31.649
WE'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

53:29.607 --> 53:31.742
( door opens and closes )

54:04.475 --> 54:06.644
PLEASE NO.

54:07.845 --> 54:10.481
I CAN'T.

55:14.412 --> 55:17.114
WE WENT INTO HIS HOUSE.
WE CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE.

55:17.147 --> 55:20.017
IAN WOULDN'T KILL HIMSELF.

55:20.050 --> 55:21.952
- MAYBE HE DID.
- NO.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.721
BRIAN.

55:23.754 --> 55:26.591
- I TOOK ONE OF THE TAPES.
- BRIAN.

55:26.624 --> 55:29.494
IT HAS TO BE HIM, ANGELA.
I HAD TO BE SURE.

55:29.527 --> 55:31.496
- Angela: WHY WOULD HE--?
- HEY, GUYS.

55:31.529 --> 55:34.031
HEY, GRAHAM.

55:37.602 --> 55:40.004
HEY, ANGEY.

55:40.037 --> 55:43.508
OH, SORRY.
HEY, GRAHAM.

55:45.776 --> 55:47.745
WAIT A SECOND.
HOW--

55:47.778 --> 55:49.947
DID I INTRODUCE
YOU GUYS?

55:49.980 --> 55:51.081
WHAT?

55:51.115 --> 55:53.050
YEAH, THE OTHER DAY
SHE WAS OVER.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.919
NO, I WASN'T.

55:54.952 --> 55:59.056
MAYBE IT WAS
SOMEONE ELSE.

55:59.089 --> 56:01.125
Angela:
I GUESS I JUST
FIGURED WE HAD MET

56:01.158 --> 56:04.929
'CAUSE I'D SEEN YOU
SO MANY TIMES WALK
IN AND OUT OF--

56:04.962 --> 56:06.531
I GUESS THAT'S
YOUR ROOM?

56:06.564 --> 56:08.533
YEAH, THAT'S MY ROOM.

56:08.566 --> 56:10.868
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HER NAME?

56:10.901 --> 56:13.471
YOU MUST HAVE TOLD ME.

56:13.504 --> 56:15.440
NO, I DIDN'T.

56:15.473 --> 56:17.475
MAYBE SHE JUST
LOOKS LIKE AN ANGELA.
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.

56:17.508 --> 56:18.776
YEAH, BUT YOU
CALLED ME ANGEY.

56:18.809 --> 56:20.678
IT'S A FUCKING
NICKNAME.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.414
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAHAM?
I'M SORRY, MAN,

56:23.448 --> 56:25.416
CAN YOU GET OUT
OF HERE, PLEASE?

56:25.450 --> 56:27.985
ALL RIGHT.
JESUS.

56:29.754 --> 56:32.590
SEE YOU SOON,
ANGELIQUE.

56:32.623 --> 56:34.859
( phone ringing )

56:39.129 --> 56:40.831
HELLO.

56:40.865 --> 56:43.200
HEY, I'M AT YOUR HOUSE.

56:43.233 --> 56:46.604
( chuckles ) HUH-UH.
I WAS ON MY WAY TO MY MOM'S

56:46.637 --> 56:49.006
AND I WANTED TO STOP HERE
AND SEE YOU FIRST.

56:49.039 --> 56:51.041
IT WAS OPEN.

56:52.242 --> 56:54.945
YEAH.
WHERE ARE YOU AT?

56:54.979 --> 56:57.615
OH, OF COURSE.

56:57.648 --> 57:00.117
BE SAFE, ANGE.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.521
HELLO?

57:03.554 --> 57:06.056
I CAN'T HEAR ANYMORE.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.058
ANGE, IF YOU'RE
SAYING SOMETHING,

57:08.092 --> 57:10.060
I CAN'T HEAR ANYMORE.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.863
I'M HANGING UP.
BYE.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.736
SHE WAS AT MY HOUSE.

57:18.769 --> 57:20.671
INSIDE?

57:20.705 --> 57:22.039
YEAH.

57:22.072 --> 57:24.041
( woman screaming
on tape )

57:24.074 --> 57:26.744
LOOK AT THIS.

57:28.646 --> 57:31.882
THIS IS THE TAPE
I PULLED FROM HIS HOUSE.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.190
( pop song playing
on radio )

57:44.862 --> 57:46.897
( bell dings )

57:52.603 --> 57:54.639
( song stops )

59:44.081 --> 59:45.816
( screams )

1:00:12.076 --> 1:00:14.812
( flashlight clicking )

1:00:41.238 --> 1:00:43.240
( screams )

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:51.742
( starts engine )

1:01:54.378 --> 1:01:58.248
( screaming, coughing )

1:02:08.125 --> 1:02:10.260
( screaming )

1:02:12.262 --> 1:02:14.231
HELP ME.

1:02:14.264 --> 1:02:17.768
HELP. HELP.

1:02:17.802 --> 1:02:19.236
HELP.

1:02:51.301 --> 1:02:53.337
( screams )

1:03:47.357 --> 1:03:49.026
WHAT?

1:03:49.059 --> 1:03:51.028
WHAT WHAT?

1:03:51.061 --> 1:03:52.897
NO.

1:03:52.930 --> 1:03:54.631
OKAY.

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:56.000
LISTEN...

1:03:56.033 --> 1:03:58.535
YOU WANT A GRANOLA BAR?

1:04:00.504 --> 1:04:02.439
IS IT LATE?

1:04:04.508 --> 1:04:07.311
IS GRAHAM HOME?

1:04:09.213 --> 1:04:12.282
I DON'T KNOW.
HIS DOOR IS ALWAYS CLOSED.

1:04:20.991 --> 1:04:23.393
WHAT?

1:04:31.668 --> 1:04:34.371
I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO GO IN.

1:04:38.475 --> 1:04:40.077
WHAT'S UP?

1:04:40.110 --> 1:04:42.079
I JUST
DON'T WANT TO.

1:04:42.112 --> 1:04:43.613
THEN WHY ARE WE HERE,
ANGELA?

1:04:43.647 --> 1:04:45.249
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GO IN.

1:04:45.282 --> 1:04:47.051
WHY?

1:04:47.084 --> 1:04:51.155
( sighs )

1:04:51.188 --> 1:04:53.623
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
SINCE THE BURIAL.

1:04:53.657 --> 1:04:56.493
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1:04:56.526 --> 1:04:59.096
- I'M STILL MAD AT HER.
- SO?

1:04:59.129 --> 1:05:01.431
I'M NOT READY
TO FORGIVE HER.

1:05:01.465 --> 1:05:04.101
YOU HAVE TO.

1:05:04.134 --> 1:05:06.103
( mother humming
on tape )

1:05:06.136 --> 1:05:09.373
I DON'T HAVE TO.
WHY DO I HAVE TO?

1:05:09.406 --> 1:05:12.109
I DON'T WANT TO,
SO WHY DO I HAVE TO?

1:05:12.142 --> 1:05:16.046
SHE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO HER LIFE WHEN SHE HAD ME,

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:18.382
WHICH SHE COMPLETELY IGNORED
WHEN SHE LEFT ME.

1:05:18.415 --> 1:05:20.117
YOUR DAD LEFT TOO,
DIDN'T HE?

1:05:20.150 --> 1:05:22.686
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T NEED HIM, OKAY?

1:05:22.719 --> 1:05:25.389
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T NEED
TO LIVE ANYMORE,

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:26.723
BUT I NEEDED HER TOO.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:28.725
AND SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

1:05:28.758 --> 1:05:31.428
AND SHE JUST LEFT ME.

1:05:31.461 --> 1:05:33.330
WHATEVER, ANGELA.

1:05:33.363 --> 1:05:36.100
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE, OKAY?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, HUH?

1:05:36.133 --> 1:05:38.002
ARE YOU JUST GONNA
STAY MAD AT HER FOREVER?

1:05:38.035 --> 1:05:39.336
WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SAY,

1:05:39.369 --> 1:05:41.138
"MY MOM DIED.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO HER GRAVE"?

1:05:41.171 --> 1:05:43.107
WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT I DO?

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:46.043
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

1:05:48.145 --> 1:05:50.747
HEY, I KNOW

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:53.217
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:55.685
I'VE BEEN THERE.

1:05:55.719 --> 1:05:58.288
I'M CURRENTLY THERE.

1:05:58.322 --> 1:06:00.290
I'M GONNA BE
BOLD HERE, ANGELA,

1:06:00.324 --> 1:06:03.227
AND I'M GONNA SAY
THAT SOMEONE KILLED MY DAD.

1:06:03.260 --> 1:06:05.562
I BELIEVE THAT.

1:06:05.595 --> 1:06:07.998
AND YOU CAN EITHER
TAKE THINGS

1:06:08.032 --> 1:06:09.533
THE WAY YOU HAVE BEEN
ALL THIS TIME

1:06:09.566 --> 1:06:12.236
AND STAY STUCK IN THIS--

1:06:12.269 --> 1:06:15.505
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS--
RUT, I GUESS.

1:06:15.539 --> 1:06:18.442
OR YOU CAN
AT THE VERY LEAST ADMIT

1:06:18.475 --> 1:06:21.211
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON HERE.

1:06:21.245 --> 1:06:25.249
SOMEONE HATES US.

1:06:31.555 --> 1:06:33.523
I DON'T KNOW,

1:06:33.557 --> 1:06:36.360
MAYBE YOU CAN ASK HER
FOR AN APOLOGY.

1:07:01.185 --> 1:07:03.153
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1:07:03.187 --> 1:07:05.422
MY MOM'S THIS WAY.

1:07:05.455 --> 1:07:07.424
ARE YOU GONNA
BE OKAY?

1:07:07.457 --> 1:07:08.692
ARE YOU?

1:07:12.229 --> 1:07:14.564
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

1:08:21.298 --> 1:08:23.433
BRIAN!

1:08:26.570 --> 1:08:28.705
- I GOT A--
- I GOT A TAPE.

1:08:29.706 --> 1:08:31.875
( dogs barking )

1:08:47.257 --> 1:08:49.259
( humming a tune )

1:10:17.614 --> 1:10:19.616
( water running )

1:11:08.732 --> 1:11:10.700
IT'S OKAY, COME ON.
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

1:11:10.734 --> 1:11:12.736
COME ON, IT'S OKAY.
COME ON, WE'LL BE FINE.

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.871
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO THE CAR.
COME ON.

1:11:14.904 --> 1:11:16.740
- I'M COMING.
- WE'LL BE FINE, OKAY?

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:18.508
WE'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO THE CAR.
DON'T WORRY.

1:11:18.542 --> 1:11:20.710
WE'LL BE FINE, OKAY?
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1:11:20.744 --> 1:11:22.512
LET'S GO.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1:11:22.546 --> 1:11:24.314
I'M COMING.

1:11:24.348 --> 1:11:26.450
WE'LL BE FINE.
WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE CAR, COME ON.

1:11:26.483 --> 1:11:28.452
WE'LL BE FINE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1:11:28.485 --> 1:11:30.454
LET'S GO, COME ON.
LET'S GO.
COME ON, BABY.

1:11:30.487 --> 1:11:32.422
LET'S GO.
WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE CAR.

1:11:47.704 --> 1:11:50.574
- IT'S FINE.
WE'LL BE FINE.
- HE'S GONNA KILL US.

1:11:50.607 --> 1:11:53.042
WE GOTTA KEEP ON DRIVING
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

1:11:53.076 --> 1:11:55.011
WHAT DOES HE WANT?
WHAT THE FUCK DOES HE WANT?

1:11:55.044 --> 1:11:57.013
WHY DOES HE HATE US?

1:11:57.046 --> 1:11:59.816
WHY DID HE KILL MY MOM?

1:12:05.622 --> 1:12:07.791
I HAVE TO CALL HER AGAIN.
I HAVE TO CALL BRIT.

1:12:10.894 --> 1:12:12.929
HEY, BRIT.

1:12:14.431 --> 1:12:16.466
BRIT?

1:12:20.169 --> 1:12:22.338
IT WASN'T BRIT.

1:12:34.484 --> 1:12:36.986
( car engine revving )

1:12:38.755 --> 1:12:40.857
WHAT IS IT?

1:12:40.890 --> 1:12:42.559
A CAR.

1:12:42.592 --> 1:12:45.662
IS IT HIS?

1:12:45.695 --> 1:12:48.498
THE HEADLIGHTS
ARE OFF.

1:12:48.532 --> 1:12:50.734
DON'T.

1:12:50.767 --> 1:12:53.437
IT'S NOT THAT DARK.

1:12:53.470 --> 1:12:54.704
IT'S DARK.

1:12:54.738 --> 1:12:57.073
( Angela crying )

1:13:03.513 --> 1:13:05.515
IT'S OKAY.
HE'S GONE.

1:13:08.452 --> 1:13:10.086
- ( thud )
-WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

1:13:10.119 --> 1:13:12.088
- I DON'T KNOW. JESUS.
- SOMETHING IN YOUR TRUNK?

1:13:12.121 --> 1:13:14.090
NO.

1:13:14.123 --> 1:13:16.125
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.
FUCK.

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:18.161
OH, GOD.

1:13:19.896 --> 1:13:22.466
JESUS CHRIST.
WE HAVE TO STOP.

1:13:22.499 --> 1:13:24.133
WHAT IS THAT?

1:13:24.167 --> 1:13:27.771
WE HAVE TO STOP.
I THINK YOUR TIRE BLEW.

1:13:28.905 --> 1:13:31.908
( car doors
open and close )

1:13:31.941 --> 1:13:34.544
( waves crashing )

1:13:39.883 --> 1:13:41.918
( exhales )

1:14:26.295 --> 1:14:28.932
( groaning )

1:15:07.871 --> 1:15:10.006
( waves crashing )

1:15:12.041 --> 1:15:13.643
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1:15:13.677 --> 1:15:15.545
WE NEED TO KEEP ON
DRIVING, OKAY?

1:15:15.579 --> 1:15:17.781
BUT THE SPARE'S
UNDER HIM.

1:15:20.049 --> 1:15:22.719
IS THIS THE ONE?

1:15:22.752 --> 1:15:26.022
I THINK SO.

1:15:26.055 --> 1:15:29.225
IT'S WEIRD.
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG.

1:15:36.365 --> 1:15:38.768
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

1:15:38.802 --> 1:15:40.770
WHERE CAN WE GO?

1:15:40.804 --> 1:15:42.806
FIND SOMEONE.

1:15:42.839 --> 1:15:45.074
AND TELL THEM THAT WE HAVE
MY DEAD NEIGHBOR

1:15:45.108 --> 1:15:47.611
IN THE TRUNK
WITH A GUN?

1:15:51.214 --> 1:15:54.183
IF WE GET BACK ON THE ROAD,
HE'LL KILLS US.

1:15:54.217 --> 1:15:57.754
WE'RE NOT ANY SAFER
IF WE STAY HERE.

1:15:57.787 --> 1:16:00.156
YEAH, BUT...

1:16:04.628 --> 1:16:08.064
IF I LEAVE IT'S LIKE
I NEVER FORGAVE HER
FOR DYING.

1:16:10.233 --> 1:16:13.069
I CAN'T DO THAT.

1:16:18.975 --> 1:16:21.010
OKAY.

1:16:27.651 --> 1:16:30.654
THE MOON'S BIG TONIGHT.

1:16:30.687 --> 1:16:33.256
I CAN'T TELL
IF IT'S FULL.

1:16:33.289 --> 1:16:36.926
I NEVER CAN.

1:16:39.763 --> 1:16:42.398
I THINK IT IS.

1:16:42.431 --> 1:16:46.235
IT'S USUALLY FOGGY.
YOU CAN'T SEE THE MOON
MOST NIGHTS.

1:16:46.269 --> 1:16:48.705
YOU CAME HERE AT NIGHT?

1:16:48.738 --> 1:16:51.107
WE WENT ALL THE TIME.

1:17:12.161 --> 1:17:14.698
EVEN NOW...

1:17:18.868 --> 1:17:22.005
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

1:17:22.038 --> 1:17:24.808
THAT I'M GLAD
I MET YOU.

1:17:32.415 --> 1:17:35.051
I'M GLAD
I MET YOU TOO.

1:17:45.094 --> 1:17:47.831
- ANGELA.
- MM?

1:17:47.864 --> 1:17:49.833
IT'S MORNING.

1:17:49.866 --> 1:17:52.101
LET'S GO.

1:17:53.102 --> 1:17:56.906
BUT I'M SO COMFORTABLE.

1:17:56.940 --> 1:17:59.809
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1:18:18.227 --> 1:18:20.830
( indistinct chatter
and music )

1:18:27.971 --> 1:18:30.706
( whimpering )

1:18:33.109 --> 1:18:35.411
( waves crashing )

1:18:40.850 --> 1:18:42.986
( chatter and music
continue )

1:18:48.091 --> 1:18:50.493
( "Deck the Halls"
playing on tape )

1:19:05.408 --> 1:19:08.377
( chatter and voices
distorted )

1:19:14.851 --> 1:19:17.854
( "Deck the Halls"
playing )

1:19:23.159 --> 1:19:25.394
( waves crashing )

1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:06.269
HER NAME WAS BETH.

1:20:11.975 --> 1:20:15.912
( crying )

1:20:15.945 --> 1:20:18.347
DON'T BOTHER
SCREAMING, OKAY?

1:20:18.381 --> 1:20:21.050
BECAUSE NO ONE'S GONNA
HEAR YOU--

1:20:21.084 --> 1:20:23.452
NO NEIGHBORS.

1:20:26.222 --> 1:20:28.024
( exclaims )

1:20:33.897 --> 1:20:37.233
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE CRYING.

1:20:37.266 --> 1:20:40.203
SORRY.

1:20:40.236 --> 1:20:42.371
SHUT UP!

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:46.442
SEE, THAT'S THE THING--

1:20:46.475 --> 1:20:50.279
NO ONE EVER
APOLOGIZED TO ME,

1:20:50.313 --> 1:20:52.982
NOT ONCE.

1:20:53.016 --> 1:20:55.518
SO WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

1:20:57.653 --> 1:20:59.422
HMM? WHAT?

1:20:59.455 --> 1:21:01.991
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

1:21:02.025 --> 1:21:05.294
I OWE YOU NOTHING.

1:21:05.328 --> 1:21:09.098
I OWE YOU HELL.

1:21:09.132 --> 1:21:11.534
THEY TOOK IT ALL.

1:21:11.567 --> 1:21:15.571
THEY TOOK
EVERYTHING I LOVED.

1:21:15.604 --> 1:21:19.909
IT WAS TONSILLITIS.

1:21:19.943 --> 1:21:21.911
( laughs )

1:21:21.945 --> 1:21:23.913
TONSILLITIS.

1:21:23.947 --> 1:21:26.149
CAN YOU FUCKING
BELIEVE THAT?

1:21:26.182 --> 1:21:29.185
IT'S NOT EVEN
A REAL DISEASE.

1:21:29.218 --> 1:21:30.954
I'M SORRY.

1:21:30.987 --> 1:21:32.521
SHUT UP!

1:21:32.555 --> 1:21:37.260
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME.

1:21:37.293 --> 1:21:39.963
IT HAPPENED TO HER.

1:21:42.531 --> 1:21:44.968
THAT'S BETH.

1:21:45.001 --> 1:21:46.469
( sobbing )

1:21:46.502 --> 1:21:49.572
MY LIFE WAS DESTROYED
BECAUSE OF TWO
FUCKING PEOPLE.

1:21:49.605 --> 1:21:51.574
- I'M SORRY.
- SHUT UP.

1:21:51.607 --> 1:21:54.243
SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

1:21:54.277 --> 1:21:56.445
SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

1:21:59.148 --> 1:22:00.549
( exhales )

1:22:00.583 --> 1:22:03.519
SEE, THAT'S WHY
I DID IT THIS WAY--

1:22:03.552 --> 1:22:06.122
TO KEEP YOU SAFE,
YOU KNOW,

1:22:06.155 --> 1:22:09.192
SO NOBODY WOULD EVER KNOW.
THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO GUESS

1:22:09.225 --> 1:22:11.594
AND MAKE UP LITTLE STORIES
ABOUT WHY THEIR CHILDREN

1:22:11.627 --> 1:22:13.997
OR THEIR PARENTS
HATED THEIR LIVES.

1:22:14.030 --> 1:22:16.099
WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO YOU.

1:22:16.132 --> 1:22:19.135
AND WHAT DID
MY DAUGHTER DO?

1:22:21.004 --> 1:22:23.639
YOU ARE TOO STUPID
FOR THIS CLASS.

1:22:23.672 --> 1:22:26.642
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID.

1:22:26.675 --> 1:22:30.113
IT'S ABOUT WHAT
YOUR PARENTS DID.

1:22:31.414 --> 1:22:34.650
THEY DESTROYED
MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

1:22:34.683 --> 1:22:37.987
AND NOW I'M GONNA
DESTROY YOURS.

1:22:38.021 --> 1:22:39.989
NO. NO.

1:22:40.023 --> 1:22:42.591
I'VE TAKEN
EVERYONE YOU LOVE.

1:22:42.625 --> 1:22:44.593
AND NOW I'M GONNA
TAKE YOU.

1:22:44.627 --> 1:22:46.529
NO.

1:22:46.562 --> 1:22:50.166
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A NORMAL PROCEDURE,

1:22:50.199 --> 1:22:51.767
ANGELA.

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:54.970
SO COULDN'T YOUR PARENTS
HAVE DONE THEIR JOBS?

1:23:05.681 --> 1:23:08.751
NO, IT WASN'T
THEIR FAULT.

1:23:08.784 --> 1:23:11.787
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:14.590
- MAYBE IT WAS WORSE
THAN WHAT THEY THOUGHT.
- ( lighter clicks )

1:23:28.504 --> 1:23:30.539
NO NO NO NO.

1:23:30.573 --> 1:23:33.409
YOUR PARENTS--

1:23:33.442 --> 1:23:36.145
THEY KILLED HER.

1:23:36.179 --> 1:23:38.681
THEY DESTROYED
MY FAMILY.

1:23:38.714 --> 1:23:40.349
( Angela screams )

1:23:43.386 --> 1:23:46.189
THEY DESTROYED
MY LIFE, ANGELA--

1:23:46.222 --> 1:23:49.558
MY LIFE, MY LIFE.
YOU GET ONE.

1:23:51.294 --> 1:23:52.528
MY LIFE!

1:23:57.333 --> 1:24:00.736
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO?

1:24:00.769 --> 1:24:04.073
- YOUR FAMILY
OWES ME THIS.
- NO NO.

1:24:04.107 --> 1:24:05.841
YOU OWE ME THIS.

1:24:05.874 --> 1:24:08.744
NO NO.

1:24:10.746 --> 1:24:12.181
NO.

1:24:12.215 --> 1:24:15.284
BABY GIRL,

1:24:15.318 --> 1:24:17.253
LISTEN TO ME.

1:24:17.286 --> 1:24:19.688
JUST LISTEN TO DADDY,
PLEASE.

1:24:19.722 --> 1:24:21.690
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

1:24:28.531 --> 1:24:30.266
LISTEN TO ME.

1:24:30.299 --> 1:24:33.169
- LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.
- ( screams )

1:24:47.516 --> 1:24:50.186
ANGELA!

1:24:52.355 --> 1:24:55.158
ANGELA!

1:24:55.191 --> 1:24:57.460
( panting )

1:25:29.425 --> 1:25:31.294
( gasps )

1:25:35.898 --> 1:25:38.234
( slow footsteps )

1:26:43.432 --> 1:26:45.734
( exclaims )

1:27:06.922 --> 1:27:09.858
YOU COULD JOIN HER.

1:27:12.428 --> 1:27:13.962
WHAT?

1:27:13.996 --> 1:27:16.499
SEE HER AGAIN.

1:27:19.702 --> 1:27:21.270
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1:27:21.304 --> 1:27:23.872
TAKE YOUR LIFE
AND SEE HER RIGHT NOW.

1:27:23.906 --> 1:27:26.041
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1:27:26.074 --> 1:27:28.844
AND I KNOW
YOU DON'T BLAME ME,
BUT I HATE MY LIFE TOO.

1:27:28.877 --> 1:27:30.846
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO FEEL ALONE.

1:27:30.879 --> 1:27:33.482
YOU COULD SEE BETH
RIGHT NOW.

1:27:38.687 --> 1:27:40.756
I KNOW.

1:27:47.863 --> 1:27:50.633
I'LL TAKE YOU FIRST.

1:28:27.836 --> 1:28:30.072
( whispers )

1:29:06.041 --> 1:29:07.976
( waves crashing )

1:29:08.010 --> 1:29:10.613
( seagulls squawking )

1:29:14.149 --> 1:29:16.118
WHAT DID YOU WRITE?

1:29:16.151 --> 1:29:18.454
MY CONTACT INFORMATION.

1:29:24.493 --> 1:29:27.162
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

1:29:27.195 --> 1:29:29.732
I DON'T KNOW.

1:29:29.765 --> 1:29:31.734
DO YOU, LIKE,
THROW IT IN?

1:29:31.767 --> 1:29:34.002
YOU JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE WAVES.

1:29:34.036 --> 1:29:36.572
LET'S THROW IT.
YOU WANT TO THROW IT?

1:29:54.823 --> 1:29:56.191
AREN'T YOU GONNA
WATCH IT?

1:29:56.224 --> 1:29:58.461
WE DON'T
WATCH IT.

1:30:09.905 --> 1:30:12.641
( instrumental music
playing )
