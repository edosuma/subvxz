00:43.564 --> 00:47.233
That was awesome! All
right, all right, my turn.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.907
You guys are full

00:56.909 --> 00:59.208
- of magic air.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.244
Gross!

01:01.246 --> 01:03.212
No!

01:03.214 --> 01:06.882
Princess? You... Okay?

01:06.884 --> 01:09.551
Yeah. It's just...
The air smells bad

01:09.553 --> 01:12.486
from your magic tricks,
and now I feel sad.

01:12.488 --> 01:15.423
I left all my scented
candles at the castle.

01:15.425 --> 01:18.258
They'd really cut through
the magic stank.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.727
Just go back to the fire
kingdom and get them...

01:20.729 --> 01:23.062
Problem solved.
Then I'll have to

01:23.064 --> 01:25.097
see my dad. I'm still
mad at him for

01:25.099 --> 01:28.433
imprisoning me in that lantern.
So unfair!

01:28.435 --> 01:32.202
Uh... We can go get

01:32.204 --> 01:33.537
them? Really?

01:33.539 --> 01:37.107
That would be really nice. But
don't let my pops see you.

01:37.109 --> 01:40.509
<i>I don't want his majesty
thinking I need anything from</i>

01:40.511 --> 01:42.345
him.

01:42.347 --> 01:44.746
It ain't me!

01:44.748 --> 01:48.016
Whoa!

01:48.018 --> 01:50.184
Oh!

01:50.186 --> 01:52.953
Flambo! For a second
I thought the

01:52.955 --> 01:55.788
- princess was farting.
- Flambo, we need you to

01:55.790 --> 01:59.257
cast "flame shield" on us.
All right!

02:18.775 --> 02:20.976
These candles must be they.

02:20.978 --> 02:24.278
They smell like an
old lady's bathroom.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.747
Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!

02:26.749 --> 02:28.949
I say it as a compliment!

02:28.951 --> 02:31.084
Like it reminds
me of my grandma.

02:31.086 --> 02:35.821
I love my grandma. No
one come-s-s-s here.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.491
Not s-since flame princes-s-s

02:39.493 --> 02:43.060
fled the cas-s-tle. Now
gues-s-s what we're gonna

02:43.062 --> 02:46.930
- kill flame king with.
- A conspirator

02:46.932 --> 02:49.932
with a hiss voice! How about...
Water?

02:49.934 --> 02:52.835
Even wors-s-e! We'll
us-s-e ic-c-e!

02:52.837 --> 02:56.271
And a conspirator
with an untied shoe!

02:56.273 --> 03:00.174
Ice? Why ice? 'Cause
it's more painful, you

03:00.176 --> 03:03.310
s-s-impleton! Cold
as ic-c-e ball-s-s!

03:03.312 --> 03:06.179
A perfect death for
the flame king!

03:06.181 --> 03:08.915
Did you hear

03:08.917 --> 03:10.482
- that?

03:10.484 --> 03:13.252
Jake, come on! We got
to stop those guys from

03:13.254 --> 03:17.522
- killing flame princess' dad!
- Right, right.

03:17.524 --> 03:22.192
Dirt bags! Where'd they go?

03:38.473 --> 03:40.841
Hey, is that new?
Yeah, I think it is.

03:40.843 --> 03:43.443
Yes, it is new. Hmm,
what do you guys think

03:43.445 --> 03:45.211
of this painting? I like it.

03:45.213 --> 03:48.347
Hey, is this one of those
paintings where the eyes follow

03:48.349 --> 03:50.982
- you?

03:56.488 --> 03:59.989
Hmm. Hmm. Come on,
let's get out of

03:59.991 --> 04:01.558
here. I don't want
to miss snack time.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.693
Snacks! Snacks!

04:03.695 --> 04:07.896
- Snacks!
- Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!

04:07.898 --> 04:11.699
Now what?

04:11.701 --> 04:14.068
And most unnatural murder-s-s.

04:14.070 --> 04:16.903
Hear that? It sounds
like a voice with a

04:16.904 --> 04:19.238
- hiss.
- The kind we are looking

04:19.241 --> 04:21.173
for! The s-serpent that did

04:21.176 --> 04:22.842
s-sting... - Stop!

04:22.844 --> 04:25.878
Thy father's life, now
wears hi-s-s crown-s-s!

04:25.880 --> 04:28.980
- Dude, the voice!
- We must follow the

04:28.982 --> 04:30.982
voice!

04:33.351 --> 04:36.887
To die, to s-sleep, to

04:36.889 --> 04:40.523
s-sleep, perchance to dream...
- Which way is the hiss

04:40.525 --> 04:43.558
voice coming from? Aye,
there's the rub, for in

04:43.560 --> 04:46.228
- that s-sleep of death...
- This way!

04:46.230 --> 04:50.698
- What dream-s-s may come.
- Which way?

04:50.700 --> 04:54.368
I s-seem to be s-saying a lot
about our s-super-s-secret

04:54.370 --> 04:58.905
- plan...
- To the left!

04:58.907 --> 05:01.106
You!

05:01.108 --> 05:06.511
- You! You! You!
- Double you! Double you!

05:06.513 --> 05:08.212
I don't think it's them.

05:08.214 --> 05:10.847
Double you! Double you!

05:15.553 --> 05:17.620
Whoa!

05:17.622 --> 05:20.122
- Jake!
- I'm okay!

05:20.124 --> 05:23.625
I think I hear that hissing
voice down this way!

05:23.627 --> 05:25.593
Whoa!

05:25.595 --> 05:28.395
- Why didn't you catch me?
- Oops!

05:28.397 --> 05:32.232
Tell me next time. I can't
think in the future.

05:32.234 --> 05:37.703
- Vent ahead.
- Jake, I want to see.

05:46.245 --> 05:49.579
- No hissing.

05:49.581 --> 05:55.083
No untied shoe. Vent.

05:55.085 --> 05:58.654
This needs something more!

05:58.656 --> 06:02.657
- Yes! Yes!
- That's the Stuff!

06:02.659 --> 06:05.992
Whoa! It's him!

06:05.994 --> 06:08.628
- Hmm?
- My bluebies!

06:08.630 --> 06:11.630
You buffoon! Where's
your partner with the

06:11.632 --> 06:13.566
untied shoe? What partner?

06:13.568 --> 06:16.302
What are you blueberries
talking about?

06:16.304 --> 06:19.270
Give it up, man! I
heard your hiss voice!

06:19.272 --> 06:23.740
- I don't have a voice!
- There's a snake on your

06:23.742 --> 06:25.809
- shoulder!
- What?

06:25.811 --> 06:27.244
Aah!

06:27.246 --> 06:28.678
Hmm.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.479
Suffering...

06:30.481 --> 06:33.682
Succotash! Now to
chop you two big

06:33.684 --> 06:37.419
blueberries into small,
bite-sized blueberries!

06:37.421 --> 06:41.188
Shakespeare.

06:41.190 --> 06:43.757
Five minutes to
curtain, everyone!

06:43.759 --> 06:48.595
- Five minutes!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

06:48.597 --> 06:56.597
Ooh!

06:56.769 --> 07:01.805
Oh! Pfft! Actors!

07:08.678 --> 07:11.113
What's going on
with the costumes?

07:11.115 --> 07:14.282
This is a theater troupe! We're
getting ready to perform

07:14.284 --> 07:16.850
for the king! Everyone
in the kingdom shall be

07:16.852 --> 07:19.353
in attendance! Of course,
you know all this,

07:19.355 --> 07:23.389
being fellow actors from
the exact same troupe.

07:23.391 --> 07:26.225
I have an idea. We'll go
onstage, act like two

07:26.227 --> 07:28.727
conspirators. You will
have one shoe untied, I

07:28.729 --> 07:31.796
will talk with a hiss voice.
We'll talk about how we want to

07:31.798 --> 07:34.198
kill the king. As we do
this, we'll study the

07:34.200 --> 07:36.900
faces of the audience and
look for guilty reactions.

07:36.902 --> 07:39.235
- That's brilliant!
- Thanks!

07:39.237 --> 07:46.174
It's an original idea by me.

07:46.176 --> 07:49.677
- Ahem! Hey, conspirator!
- Hey, co-conspirator!

07:49.679 --> 07:52.913
Let's talk about how we're
gonna kill the king!

07:52.915 --> 07:55.548
Shh! S-somebody
might hear our evil

07:55.550 --> 07:59.319
<i>plot! Man, I am so lost.</i>

07:59.321 --> 08:04.690
Psst! The audience!
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

08:04.692 --> 08:07.392
Uh, uh...

08:07.394 --> 08:09.494
You think that's one of them?

08:09.496 --> 08:11.362
Maybe. Let's keep going.

08:11.364 --> 08:15.766
- So, what are you packing?
- Water, man... enough of

08:15.768 --> 08:20.603
it to put out the king's fire!
Uh, uh... Hmm.

08:20.605 --> 08:24.406
I think he's starting

08:24.408 --> 08:25.740
to crack. Water?

08:25.742 --> 08:28.042
You know what's
even more painful?

08:28.044 --> 08:31.078
If we pour ice in his ear!
That's how we'll kill

08:31.080 --> 08:33.578
the flame king! Pbht!

08:33.581 --> 08:38.284
Kill the flame king? This
is treason disguised as a

08:38.285 --> 08:40.118
play! Guards, seize them!

08:40.120 --> 08:42.453
What?! No!

08:42.456 --> 08:45.122
Please! We were trying
to warn you about

08:45.124 --> 08:46.924
assassins! Hmm.

08:46.926 --> 08:50.360
- Search them!

08:50.362 --> 08:52.529
Huh?

08:52.531 --> 08:55.131
Sire, it's your daughter's
scented candles!

08:55.133 --> 08:57.232
Sickos!

08:57.234 --> 09:00.702
- Off with their heads!
- Whoa, what?!

09:00.704 --> 09:03.471
No, please!

09:03.473 --> 09:07.941
S-stay s-still. "S-still"?

09:07.943 --> 09:11.244
Untied shoelace?

09:11.246 --> 09:15.981
It's them! S-so long, s-suckers!

09:15.983 --> 09:17.949
Naked babies, naked
babies, naked babies!

09:17.951 --> 09:19.617
Naked babies, naked
babies, naked babies!

09:19.619 --> 09:22.253
Naked babies, naked babies,

09:22.255 --> 09:24.321
naked babies!

09:24.323 --> 09:26.990
We found 'em! The
executioners are the real

09:26.992 --> 09:28.991
king-killers! S-silence!

09:28.993 --> 09:31.627
Wait, wait, wait... That voice.

09:31.629 --> 09:34.730
Guards, take off their hoods!
Aah!

09:34.732 --> 09:37.766
My identity!

09:37.768 --> 09:40.267
Ugh!

09:40.269 --> 09:44.138
Furnius and torcho!
Hello... Uncle!

09:44.140 --> 09:49.008
Arrest the executioners!

09:49.010 --> 09:52.911
Hmm... I thought I had you two

09:52.913 --> 09:56.814
extinguished. You
cannot quench the

09:56.816 --> 10:01.451
flame-s-s-s of revenge! You
snuffed out our father to

10:01.453 --> 10:03.820
become king! Oh, yeah... Ha ha.

10:03.822 --> 10:06.189
Take them to the
punishment room!

10:06.191 --> 10:09.325
I'll des-s-Troy all of you...
Release me!

10:09.327 --> 10:13.528
- With ic-c-c-e!
- Wait, so you... you

10:13.530 --> 10:16.364
extinguished their dad? Mm-hmm.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.366
And... Everyone is evil here?

10:19.368 --> 10:24.203
<i>Mm-hmm... all evil.</i>

10:24.205 --> 10:27.540
Then... Is flame princess...
Evil?

10:27.542 --> 10:29.841
Or maybe chaotic neutral?
She's evil.

10:29.843 --> 10:32.511
Okay... So your daughter's evil...
we've

10:32.513 --> 10:35.546
established that. But do
you think if a good guy

10:35.548 --> 10:39.216
really liked her... Could
he change her to good?

10:39.218 --> 10:42.952
Hmm, well, there'd be penalties
to her experience if

10:42.954 --> 10:46.121
she acted out of alignment, but...
Yes.

10:46.123 --> 10:53.728
<i>Someone could change her.
Change her to good?</i>

10:53.730 --> 10:58.532
Aww!

11:04.238 --> 11:08.406
Evil, evil, evil, evil.

11:08.408 --> 11:14.211
Evil, evil, evil... Evil! Aah!
