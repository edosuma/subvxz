<i>The hospital got in touch.</i>

00:02.680 --> 00:04.320
Ferguson's fit for release,

00:04.400 --> 00:06.440
so I've prepared
the transfer papers.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.280
She's ready
to go straight to Sydney.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.240
Yeah, I'm afraid that
won't be happening.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.000
Ferguson can't come back here.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.040
I am genuinely sorry,
but there is nothing I can do.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.720
Could you hack
into the government system?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.840
You reckon
you could find my sister?

00:19.920 --> 00:22.520
-No, it's under the seats!
-Gonna smash the shit out of it!

00:22.600 --> 00:24.240
[woman] No, you're not gonna
smash the shit out of it!

00:26.560 --> 00:30.000
One of your inmates just made
a mockery of all our hard work.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.320
I will
get to the bottom of it.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.000
-Don't!
-Who did it? Who did it?

00:33.080 --> 00:35.800
Judy doesn't know nothing
about privileges, all right?

00:35.880 --> 00:37.040
She's just a kid.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
Get in.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.640
[screaming]

00:41.720 --> 00:43.360

Judy Bryant is a terrorist.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.440

<i>Dad came to visit me.</i>

00:48.640 --> 00:49.680
He's really sick.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.800
It's cancer.
I got you this.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.520
Call him.
Make things right.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.920
She's shown her hand.
She wants to be top dog.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.080
Hey, are you planning
on taking her down, or what?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.800
We're just chasing the money.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.680
You attacked Ruby and Boomer,
and now it's gonna stop.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.360
If you want to fight me,
that's fine.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.520
I just don't like your odds.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.720
Mitchell's not back.
It's past 4:00.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.240
I told her about the curfew
like 12 times.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.760
<i>It's Jonesy.</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:14.280

02:11.280 --> 02:12.440
Coffee's on.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.520
Cheers,
I'll be out in a sec.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.160
[Jones]
<i>What's happening?</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:32.640
I want to speak to my sister.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.880
<i>Yeah, first the statement.</i>

02:33.960 --> 02:35.080
It's all arranged.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.680
<i>They're coming to take it.</i>

02:36.760 --> 02:38.520
When?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.280
Today. They didn't give me
a fuckin' appointment, Jonesy.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.520
Righto, well,
text me when it's done.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.080
I wanna speak to Ruby!

02:52.560 --> 02:53.920
Rita?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.560
<i>I'm sorry. I...</i>

02:57.640 --> 02:58.840
It's all good.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.360
I'm gonna fix this.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.760
Yeah, you better fix it.
Get movin'!

03:14.920 --> 03:16.440
[chatter]

03:18.720 --> 03:20.160
Smiles! Miles.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.160
-Hey, where's Ruby?
-Yeah, is she back yet?

03:23.240 --> 03:24.840
Oh, no,
good morning to you, too.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.080
Have a nice day.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.760
I swear to God, sometimes I just
wanna belt her in the gob.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.280
Booms, something's wrong.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.520
There's no way that Ruby would
fuck up her parole like this.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.160
Thanks.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.560
What do we do about Ferguson?
What's her game?

03:45.640 --> 03:46.880
I think this "amnesia"

03:46.960 --> 03:49.320
is a ploy to elicit
sympathy from a jury.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.480
The Kath Maxwell murder's
open and shut.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.800
It's a guaranteed conviction.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.040
No, not entirely.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.160
A sympathetic jury
could still derail it.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.320
Well, at least
with this amnesia ploy,

03:59.400 --> 04:00.840
I can lock her up
in the Psych Unit.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.680
We need a strategy.
She comes in today.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.120
Yeah, I'm aware
of that, but--

04:04.200 --> 04:05.240
[knock on door]

04:05.320 --> 04:06.440
Come in!

04:06.520 --> 04:08.000
Governor,
Novak's here to see you.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.560
Thank you.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.240
Where's Ruby?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.000
I was going to ask
if you'd heard anything.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.640
Well, the sponsor said he
dropped her off at the shop,

04:16.720 --> 04:17.920
and then she scarpered.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.120
No. There's no way
that she just ran off.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.000
This is going
to affect her parole.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.440
She was going to try
and see Rita

04:28.520 --> 04:29.880
and tell her about their dad.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.160
Rita? How?

04:31.240 --> 04:33.640
Can you just
look into it, please?

04:33.720 --> 04:34.880
I'm worried.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.120
Yeah, sure.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.280
All right, well I'll see
what I can find out

04:42.360 --> 04:44.040
and get back to you.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.320
Yep.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.960
Hey, Connors!

04:50.040 --> 04:53.160
Apparently your sister's done
a runner from day release.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.720
You haven't seen her
hanging around, have you?

04:54.800 --> 04:57.560
Yeah. She's
under my fuckin' bed.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.280
-Oh, shit!
-You all right?

05:05.760 --> 05:06.920
Righto.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.560
-There you go.
-Thanks.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.120
Want some painkillers?

05:11.200 --> 05:14.200
No, I'll go lie down
and rest it, thanks.

-Hi.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.520
-Check this out.
-What?

05:58.520 --> 06:00.600
Oh, my God.
[laughter]

06:00.680 --> 06:01.720
More than halfway.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.120
We're so rich.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.200
Oh, shut!

06:05.280 --> 06:07.960
You're gonna run out of donors
to threaten at some point.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.440
[Lou]
Oh, my God.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.840
I'm sorry, who asked you?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.320
No, no, come on.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.760
Give us your bright ideas.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.880
What?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.440
I mean, is there...

06:18.520 --> 06:20.400
is there anybody else
that you'd like us to kill?

06:23.560 --> 06:25.200
You ever thought about gear?

06:28.640 --> 06:31.280
Uh, no. It's too hard
to bring in.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
Not LSD.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.480
I don't have the contacts.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.000
I do.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.720
Kelly!

06:39.800 --> 06:41.960
You've got an appointment
at the hospital

06:42.040 --> 06:43.280
to have that finger looked at.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.800
Oh, about fuckin' time.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.680
Here.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.960
Look after that.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.480
Oi.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.640
How come you're so keen
to help us?

07:00.720 --> 07:03.280
I'd like to see
you get what you want.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.920
And this way, you don't have
to chop any fingers off, so ...

07:08.280 --> 07:09.440
win-win.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.600
[woman]
Get out. No, get out!

07:19.440 --> 07:20.800
Novak, a word, please?

07:26.560 --> 07:30.520
Hey, I've just spoken to
someone from Protective Custody.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.000
Rita hasn't seen Ruby.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.200
Looks like you were wrong.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.440
I think
she's just done a runner.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.520
Hey, thank you.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.040
One more thing.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.840
Ferguson's coming back.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.080
What?

07:50.160 --> 07:51.400
We had a deal.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.920
Yeah, the Minister reneged.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.320
The women are going
to destroy her

07:55.400 --> 07:57.000
the second she walks
back in here.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.000
Just don't worry, hey?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.120
This is not your problem.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.480

08:02.560 --> 08:04.640

to the Psych Unit.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.280
I'm just letting you know.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.520
Hey. What if Marie's got
something to do with Ruby?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.560
Forget Marie. You're not
going to fucking believe this.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.840

How's it going?

08:36.040 --> 08:37.920
Oh, I hope it's working.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.200
Can I get some more
ice, please?

08:42.280 --> 08:43.960
-Sure.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.880
No history of drug use?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.200
I wouldn't think so.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.760
Why is that?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.240
I like the feeling
of being in control.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.200
What can you tell me about
your educational background?

17:02.160 --> 17:04.360
I... I think
I was well educated.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.880
What makes you say that?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.960
I have a comprehensive
general knowledge

17:09.040 --> 17:10.800
and an understanding
how the world works.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.640
I just... I just can't...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.160
can't say where it came from.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.120
Leisure interests.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.280
Played a bit of chess
in the hospital.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.920
Turns out
I was quite good at it.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.560
What about family?
Next of kin?

17:44.400 --> 17:45.600
Kath?

17:48.720 --> 17:50.040
No, no family.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.760
And how do you know that?

17:53.800 --> 17:55.680
Nobody found me
in the hospital.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.720
When is your
committal hearing?

18:04.800 --> 18:06.400
In a month's time.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.160
Right,
and your indexed charge?

18:10.960 --> 18:13.160
They say that I killed someone.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.960
And who was it?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.880
A woman with the same name.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.520
Kath Maxwell.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.360
I've just heard that you let
Judy Bryant out of the slot

18:33.440 --> 18:35.160
after just 24 hours.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.320
Yes. To cover your arse.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.200
She was threatening
to go to the Ombudsman

18:39.280 --> 18:40.920
about harsh treatment.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.560
So you kowtowed to her?

18:42.640 --> 18:45.080
Well, I wouldn't need to
if you hadn't interfered.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.440
Somebody had to.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.320
Discipline at this prison
is a joke.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.240
Linda stripped
and pepper-sprayed her

18:51.320 --> 18:53.080
at your instructions,
she said.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.880
Well, clearly Linda
misinterpreted my instructions.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.040
Okay, so what was I supposed to
tell the Ombudsman about that?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.960
Ms. Myles was doing her job.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.440
She was conducting
a strip search,

19:01.520 --> 19:03.120
and the prisoner
became threatening.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.280
Since when
has that been protocol?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.800
How dare you question me!

19:07.800 --> 19:09.080
I'm the Governor
of this prison.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.080
You seem to forget that.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.600
You're only Governor
because I made a deal with Vera.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.920
[Jackson]
<i>Tell me it's bullshit, Vera.</i>

19:19.000 --> 19:20.440
I can't.

19:20.520 --> 19:21.720
What was the deal?

19:21.800 --> 19:25.120
I said I would only
take this job

19:25.200 --> 19:26.920
if you
stayed on as Governor.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.640
So she did want
to get rid of me?

19:28.720 --> 19:31.280
It--it is a bit more
complicated than that, Will.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.480
Do you know what?

19:32.560 --> 19:34.720
I'll do you both a favour,
okay?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.480
-I'll resign.
-No.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.360
No.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.960
Jesus, I didn't stick
my neck out

19:41.040 --> 19:43.120
just so that you
could throw your career away.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.400
You need to be Governor.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.840
I don't need
to put up with this shit!

19:46.920 --> 19:49.880
Okay, so what about all that
stuff about redeeming yourself?

19:49.960 --> 19:51.840
About making it up to the women?

19:51.920 --> 19:54.440
You know I was genuine.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.840
But I'm fucking sick to death
of being micromanaged.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.560
I know it's frustrating.

19:59.480 --> 20:00.680
She is ...

20:01.800 --> 20:03.280
she is a perfectionist,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.120
and sometimes she just
loses perspective.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.480
Well, she's lost me.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.560
Can you just hang in there.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.560
She will be gone soon
and focused on other prisons,

20:13.640 --> 20:15.400
and things
will get back to normal.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.960
[man]
Come on, use the jab.

20:23.240 --> 20:26.320
Good job. Nice, nice, nice.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.680
More of that, come on.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.280
Come on, pick it up,
boys, pick it up.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.720
Nice.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.800
Go on, use your head, mate.
Use your head.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.200
-Excuse me?
-Pick it up.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.480
You Eddie?

20:39.560 --> 20:41.440
No, sorry.
Here he comes now.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.720
Thanks.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.000
Come on, John, head, mate.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.480
Hey, Eddie,
got a message for ya.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.680
[man] Use your head, mate,
use your head.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.800
Hang on a sec, mate.
I'll call you back.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.800
-Who are you?
-I'm Ruby's sister.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.040
You're gonna tell me
where they've taken her.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.160
Taken her?

21:03.240 --> 21:04.320
Oh, for fuck's sake!

21:04.400 --> 21:06.360
-Hey!
-Back off.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.280
I know this number.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.520
You told Jonesy
where to find Ruby.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.720
They're cops.
Wanted to question her.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.280
Crooked cops.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.240
They've abducted her,
ya fuckwit!

21:21.320 --> 21:22.520
Oh, shit.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.720
Listen, they threatened
to pull my boxing license.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.920
The gym's 10K in debt.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.560
So they offered you money.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.440
My family relies on this place.
It can't go under.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.000
-They paid you yet?
-No.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.400
Good. You're going
to call Jonesy,

21:36.480 --> 21:38.680
you're going to ask him for
your payment immediately,

21:38.760 --> 21:40.360
or you're going to dob him in.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.960
Are you crazy? If they are
crooked and I fuck with them,

21:42.040 --> 21:43.240
they're gonna come after me!

21:45.480 --> 21:48.680
You do as I tell you,
or I'll fuck with you right now.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.520
[Jones]
Took your time.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.640
[Morelli]
Don't start, mate.

21:54.720 --> 21:58.400
[cell phone buzzes]

21:58.480 --> 22:00.120
-Yeah?
<i>-It's Eddie.</i>

22:00.200 --> 22:03.000
Look, shit's hitting the fan.
I need to get paid.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.000
Settle down, mate.
You'll get your money.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.080
No, no, listen. The prison's
been ringing me all morning.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.320
I want my money, or I'm gonna
tell them she's with you.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.000
No, no, no, no, don't do that.
Don't do that.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.880
Stupid idea.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.560
Look, I'm out and about on
another job, but I can meet ya.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.400
Let's say half an hour,
Williamstown Cemetery.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.240
Yep.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.280
All right, see ya.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.480
Well done, Eddie.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.760
That was good.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.440
That your car?

22:36.680 --> 22:40.280
Your manager is becoming
a real pain in the arse.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.400
Save me some.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.040
Ah, Keane?

22:55.120 --> 22:56.880
Keane? I need a word.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.720
Not you, Kelly.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.360
[Lou] Ahh.

23:05.920 --> 23:10.000
I got a report that you were
assaulted by another prisoner.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.480
What do you mean?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.520
Cynthia Rattray
attempted to rape you?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.520
That's bullshit.
Where'd you hear that?

23:28.400 --> 23:31.200
Just so you know, you'll be
facing an assault charge

23:31.280 --> 23:32.400
for your attack on Rattray.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.040
What?

23:34.920 --> 23:36.680
I told you what happened.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.760
Fuckin' hell!

23:56.080 --> 23:57.640
Why'd you lie to Ms. Bennett?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.960
You shouldn't have
told a screw about that.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.920
I went out on a limb
to help you,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.280
and now I'm facing
an assault charge.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.840
You haven't told Lou
about this either, have you?

24:13.360 --> 24:15.360
[sighs]

24:16.320 --> 24:20.240
What's going on, Reb, hmm?

24:21.760 --> 24:24.240
If you can't talk to Lou,
then talk to me.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.080
Listen, I don't want Lou
to know what happened.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.400
Why?

24:27.480 --> 24:29.240
Because she'll
fucking kill her.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.080
Then you need to make
a formal complaint.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.000
Oh, and admit what?

24:34.080 --> 24:37.080
What, that I'm so piss-weak
that I can't even defend myself?

24:37.160 --> 24:38.880
Like don't you get it, Marie?

24:38.960 --> 24:41.840
I want people
to see me as a real guy.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.880
I see you as a real guy.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.560
Yeah, really?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.000
Hey.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.400
I do.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.560
I really do.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.880
You remind me of my son.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.360
Well, he was lucky
to have you.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.400
The last time this happened, my
own Mum didn't even believe me.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.880
Last time?

25:27.280 --> 25:29.640
Come here. Hey.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.160
I'm going to conduct
a Rorschach test on her.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.320
Looking at inkblots?

25:50.400 --> 25:51.680
Yes.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.800
Typically psychopaths
see violent images.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.480
It's a clear marker,

25:55.560 --> 25:57.800
so it could potentially
flush out any malingering.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.480
I will show you a series
of images,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.240
and I just
want you to respond

26:04.320 --> 26:06.720
with the first association
that comes to your mind.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.160
<i>Okay?</i>

26:09.240 --> 26:10.760
<i>Go ahead. I'm ready.</i>

26:10.840 --> 26:12.080
<i>Okay.</i>

26:19.000 --> 26:22.800
Two Hindu priests
performing a traditional dance.

26:24.640 --> 26:28.120
[Dr Miller]<i> Wow, that's not</i>
<i>a response that I've often had.</i>

26:28.200 --> 26:29.640
Here.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.280
Turbans, robes.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.520
Stamping their feet,
clapping their hands together.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.880
Okay.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.480
Here's the next one.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.040
A butterfly. Looks like
a beautiful butterfly.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.080
Okay.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.720
How about this one?

27:04.280 --> 27:05.520
<i>Kath?</i>

27:09.320 --> 27:12.520
Don't know
about this one. Just...

27:12.600 --> 27:14.840
nothing's springing to mind.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.360
Well, that's okay.
Take your time.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.160
There's
no right or wrong answers.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.400
Two baby elephants drinking
out of a glass fountain.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.840
Marie.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.760
<i>-Salaam.</i>
<i>-Salaam.</i>

27:46.800 --> 27:48.040
Long time no see.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.400
Mm-hmm.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.080
Heard you
got out of the business.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.000
I have.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.600
Um...

27:54.680 --> 27:55.880
But there's a friend here

27:55.960 --> 27:58.000
who's looking
to start something up.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.560
How well do you know
this friend?

28:01.640 --> 28:03.480
Well enough, yeah.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.480
Her name's Lou Kelly,
former top dog,

28:05.560 --> 28:08.640
so she's got a decent crew
and plenty of money.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.600
What's she after? H?

28:11.680 --> 28:14.640
Nah, too hard
to get that in.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.200
LSD.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.440
You interested?

28:20.480 --> 28:21.880
I'll talk to a few people.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.880
Let me see what I can do.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.880
[knock on door]

28:26.960 --> 28:28.160
Yes?

28:30.440 --> 28:31.760
Excuse me, um,
Ms. Bennett.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.040
Can I talk to you
for a second?

28:33.120 --> 28:35.720
Yeah, sure.
Can you wait outside?

28:38.400 --> 28:44.040
I, uh, I lied to you before,
and I'm sorry.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.160
Rattray did attack me,

28:47.240 --> 28:48.840
but I don't want to make
a formal complaint.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.320
Did Winter
put you up to this?

28:50.400 --> 28:53.680
No. She's telling
the truth, I promise.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.560
She's the one who saved me.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.080
Are you okay?
Do you need to see a nurse?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.400
No, I'm all good.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.720
Well, I'll have
Rattray slotted.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.240
I'll get
onto the police and--

29:04.320 --> 29:05.720
No.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.400
She'll find a way
to get back at me somehow.

29:10.840 --> 29:14.040
All right, I will think
what else we can do,

29:14.120 --> 29:16.880
and in the meantime, I'll have
her moved to another block.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.920
Thank you.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.160
Okay.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.520
[Rebel clears throat]

29:27.440 --> 29:30.160
[knock on door]

29:30.240 --> 29:31.480
[man]<i> Connors?</i>

29:34.160 --> 29:36.320
Fancy some lunch?

29:39.280 --> 29:40.440
Connors?

29:46.080 --> 29:47.240
Wake up!

29:56.760 --> 29:58.360
[voicemail]
<i>Gidday, you've called Eddie.</i>

29:58.440 --> 30:00.360
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>or send me a text.</i>

30:00.440 --> 30:03.240
Yeah, it's Jones. I'm here.
Where the fuck are you, dickwad?

30:19.280 --> 30:20.440
You can go have a break,
if you want.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.680
Okay.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.280
-I'll keep an eye on her.
-Thanks.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.920
I remember you.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.800
You... you visited me
in the hospital.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.760
Hello, Joan.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.640
Please don't call me that.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.640
I'm... I'm Kath Maxwell.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.560
So here's the deal, okay?

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
You think you're Kath Maxwell.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.480
That's totally fine with me.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.640
I'm happy to call you Kath.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.680
I'm happy to believe you
genuinely are Kath Maxwell.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.240
No problem at all.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.000
Best possible outcome
for all of us.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.440
If, on the other hand...

31:22.520 --> 31:26.040
you're not a hundred percent
Kath...

31:27.400 --> 31:28.760
well, that's okay too.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.520
I'll still fully support you

31:32.600 --> 31:35.080
with being Kath Maxwell...

31:36.560 --> 31:38.640
as long as it stays that way.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.680
I'll make sure the others

31:41.760 --> 31:45.360
respect this arrangement
as well.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.520
What... what others?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.480
My colleagues.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.720
You know what I'm saying.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.920
Leave me and my family alone.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.760
You... you seem
a little confused.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.160
Maybe you should talk
to Dr Miller.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.800
He... he's quite capable.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.800
[Jones]
Unbelievable.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.480
Fuck-knuckle didn't show up.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.240
-[Morelli] Did you call him?
-Yeah.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.200
Went straight
to his message bank.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.760
Well, he's obviously not that
desperate for cash then, is he?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.440
Fuck him.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.760
[Jones] But I mean, it's
weird though, right? It's odd.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.960
Well, he probably
just shit himself

33:18.040 --> 33:19.280
when he realized
it was a dumb idea

33:19.360 --> 33:20.520
to threaten a couple of cops.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.080
Maybe.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.080
I mean, he's not
the sharpest tool in the shed.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.880
[Morelli]
I'll take over, Jonesy.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.040
[Ruby] Hey.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.960
Can I have some water?
I'm thirsty.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.200
Does this look like a café?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.080
You'll get water when
your sister gets back to us

33:37.160 --> 33:39.000
about that statement.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.320
[cell phone buzzes]

33:42.880 --> 33:44.040
That'll be her.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.840
Yeah?

33:51.520 --> 33:53.120
Righto, thanks for
the tip-off.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.040
Fuck!

33:55.120 --> 33:56.120
What is it?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.120
Connors has escaped.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.560
-Fuck.
-Jesus.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.320
-How?
-I don't know.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
But that will explain
Eddie's no-show.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.400
Oh, you think?

34:04.480 --> 34:06.160
While I was standing
in that cemetery,

34:06.240 --> 34:07.800
she would have been
looking right at me.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.440
She could be here now.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.600
You know your sister's problem?

34:22.680 --> 34:24.680
She never does
what she's fuckin' told.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.680
Boomer, I just saw Marie
in the Visitors' Centre.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.320
Yeah, so?

34:32.400 --> 34:34.360
She was with this guy,
Basra, one of her old heavies.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.000
Booms, I think you're right.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.080
She's got this creep to do
something to Ruby,

34:39.160 --> 34:41.000
and now he's here
reporting back to her.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.880
What the fuck is this about?

34:44.960 --> 34:47.160
Told ya, we're just gonna go
and have a little chat.

34:52.600 --> 34:53.880
Where's Ruby?

34:55.040 --> 34:56.960
-I don't know.
-Well, she's missing.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.880
Have you killed her?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.680
I've had nothing to do
with her going missing.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.880
[Allie] Bullshit!

35:01.960 --> 35:03.520
I saw your hatchet man here.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.640
Oh, no, you've got it
all wrong.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.000
I was trying to score
some gear.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.920
You tried to kill her
last week.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.400
I was trying to stop Lou!

35:10.480 --> 35:11.440
I know what you're capable of.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.160
You're a fucking evil bitch.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.920
I don't want to kill Ruby
anymore, I swear to you.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.720
[groans]

35:22.480 --> 35:24.000
Now tell us the truth.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.520
I am telling you the truth!

35:25.600 --> 35:28.200
[groans]

35:28.280 --> 35:30.560
I heard Ruby absconded.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.520
What's going on?

35:32.600 --> 35:34.360
Close the door.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.400
She didn't abscond.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.880
Yeah, this bitch
has fucked her up,

35:38.960 --> 35:40.640
so now she's gotta talk.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.440
Just tell me what he's done
to her. I know you're behind it.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.760
I've had nothing to do with her
going missing, I swear--

35:44.840 --> 35:47.680
[Marie]
Ohh, shit!

35:47.760 --> 35:49.560
Just fucking tell me!

35:58.000 --> 35:59.320
I know how to make her talk.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.440
[distant thunder rumbles]

Rita!

37:03.640 --> 37:05.240
[Jones] Morelli!

37:05.320 --> 37:06.680
[Ruby]
No, no, no, no, no!

37:06.760 --> 37:08.960
He shot my fucking sister!

37:09.040 --> 37:11.200
Paul! Morelli!

37:23.760 --> 37:26.680
Please don't do it! No! No!

37:36.640 --> 37:40.520
-No--
-Where is she?

37:40.600 --> 37:43.480
-I don't know!
-Go again.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.920
No, shit, shit, stop, stop!
She's drowning!

38:04.600 --> 38:06.120
It wasn't me!

38:07.640 --> 38:08.720
It wasn't me!

38:08.800 --> 38:10.000
I think
she's telling the truth.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.200
Bullshit!

38:11.280 --> 38:12.600
No, she would have
broken by now.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.000
No, we keep going
until she admits it.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.640
Allie, I think
she's had enough!

38:15.720 --> 38:18.240
Get out!
Both of you!

38:20.080 --> 38:21.040
Go!

38:21.120 --> 38:23.760
[retching]

38:26.560 --> 38:28.280
You're a lying cunt...

38:28.360 --> 38:29.720
Allie...

38:29.800 --> 38:30.960
...and you're going
to tell the truth.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.640
Please don't.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.920
Please!

38:35.200 --> 38:37.640
[gasping]

38:37.720 --> 38:39.160
Morelli!

38:39.240 --> 38:41.280
[distant thunder rumbles]

38:43.840 --> 38:45.600
I know you're out there,
Connors!

38:45.680 --> 38:47.600
Get your arse out in the open
where I can see it,

38:47.680 --> 38:49.200
or I'm gonna
shoot your sister!

38:49.280 --> 38:51.840
Rita! Don't do it,
he'll shoot you!

38:51.920 --> 38:53.840
You know me, Connors.
You know I'll fuckin' do it.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.040
You do that, and you're
a dead man, Jonesy.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.160
Point blank. Not gonna miss.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.600
What about Morelli?
Is he dead?

39:04.680 --> 39:05.840
No.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.240
He's just having
a little lie-down.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.320
Let Ruby go, and we'll
sort this out between us.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.520
I can still give you
that statement.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.080
No, you put your weapon down,
and then we'll talk.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.840
No. Don't do it, Rita.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.040
-Don't...
-Otherwise she gets this.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.600
Is that what you want, huh?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.800
Right.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.040
Kick it here.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.840
Bad idea,
leaving protective custody.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.760
Look at the shit
you've got yourselves in now.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.000
You know, I could just
ice you both right here,

39:48.080 --> 39:50.080
and then you'd just be assumed
fugitives on the run.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.960
True.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.760
But there's still my statement,
and they will investigate you.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.600
I just want my sister
to be safe.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.280
It's okay,
my little Kangaruby.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.920
It's all okay.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.040
You made my little sister
cry, you prick.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.440
Don't come any closer.
What are you doing?

40:09.520 --> 40:11.800
No, I'm just comin'
to give her a hug.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.160
Fuck!

40:38.000 --> 40:39.200
Shit.

40:46.480 --> 40:47.640
Sissy!

40:47.720 --> 40:48.640
-Fuck.
-Come on.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.080
Jesus.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.960
We don't have much time.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.560
I've gotta run,

40:57.640 --> 40:59.560
and you've gotta get back
to Wentworth, quick smart.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.200
Is the other one dead?

41:01.280 --> 41:02.520
It was an accident.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.480
But Jones is out there
to spin the story.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.200
Yeah, but it's his word
against yours.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.560
I'll back you.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.640
They'll always believe
a cop over a crim,

41:11.720 --> 41:13.760
especially
one who's already...

41:13.840 --> 41:15.800
belted a friggin' inmate
to death.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.520
No, sis.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.400
Running's not good for us.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.680
We gotta tell 'em
everything that happened.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.000
Eddie will back us up too.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.400
Don't worry about Eddie.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.000
They've got him stitched up.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.000
He won't help us.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.040
-Eddie?
-Yeah.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.560
-But, Sissy...
-Listen to me.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.760
You say you went on a bender
with your friends

41:35.840 --> 41:37.120
and missed curfew.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.840
You didn't see me,

41:38.920 --> 41:41.360
and you know nothing about
any of this, you got that?

41:41.440 --> 41:43.520
No, Rita.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.720
You can save your parole.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.120
You're gonna get blamed
for killing Morelli.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.320
We have to fight that.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.480
I don't have time
for this, Roo.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.160
I wanna see Dad
before he passes.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.600
Yeah, and I wanna go
see Dad too.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.720
I know you do.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.960
Come here.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.760
I love you.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.040
Get back to Wentworth.

42:16.640 --> 42:20.000
It's not easy being top dog,
is it, hmm?

42:23.400 --> 42:25.040
It's a bitch of a job.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.640
[laughing]

42:28.800 --> 42:30.640
You had Ruby killed.

42:31.800 --> 42:32.880
This is about her.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.800
Is it? I don't think
it is anymore.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.040
Oh, shut up.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.360
Hmm? I think
it's about you and me.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.960
Oh, fucking shut up!

42:43.040 --> 42:44.680
Come on, you know it's true.

42:44.760 --> 42:48.880
Where's Ruby?
Where's Ruby?

42:48.960 --> 42:52.040
You wanna punish me
because you loved me.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.080
Isn't that right?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.200
You are nothing to me.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.160
I should have put
a bullet in your head,

43:08.240 --> 43:09.600
instead of your leg.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.480
Allie, don't!
No, Allie!

43:13.560 --> 43:15.680
-Allie, no, please--
-Oh, Allie!

43:15.760 --> 43:16.840
Shit.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.640
Hey, hey, Ruby's okay.

43:18.720 --> 43:21.080
She's been found, yeah?

43:21.160 --> 43:23.160
Marie's been
telling the truth.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.280
What the fuck
happened to you?

43:56.800 --> 43:59.720
Hey, I, um, just
want to let you know,

43:59.800 --> 44:01.640
I cleared you
with Ms. Bennett.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.280
Thanks.

44:03.360 --> 44:04.960
Wait, what happened?

44:10.600 --> 44:11.880
Allie.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.400
Why?

44:15.480 --> 44:16.960
She thought I had something

44:17.040 --> 44:20.000
to do with Ruby
going missing...

44:21.200 --> 44:22.760
which I didn't. I...

44:24.160 --> 44:25.960
And what are you going
to do about it?

44:26.840 --> 44:28.240
No, nothing.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.760
No, that's bullshit, Marie.
I'm gonna tell Lou.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.040
No fuckin' way.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.400
It'll just lead
to a shit fight.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.800
I tell you,
don't become like Allie.

44:47.720 --> 44:50.560
She... she...
She used to be so sweet.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.760
Find out what happened?

45:04.840 --> 45:06.840
No. Wouldn't tell me.
