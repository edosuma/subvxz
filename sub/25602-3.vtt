00:14.520 --> 00:15.623
I don't know.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.665
I have good news. I know what
happened to the boys.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.784
Lucy
shot a tracking device
onto the elevator

00:20.880 --> 00:22.780
so she could find it
wherever it went.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.381
Find Lucy, find the boys.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.629
We need a doctor.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.347
I think we have
just enough plasma for John.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.828
We're not turning
my little brother Hullen.

Where the he//$ are we?

00:35.600 --> 00:36.737
We're a farming collective.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.219
What did you do?
This was a con job.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.589
They are not farmers.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.347
They are prisoners
in a labor colony.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.380
You're wrong. Organ harvest.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.457
We are the farms.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.777
What happens next?

00:51.520 --> 00:53.420
They send a ship full
of guards and guns now.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.704
On your knees!
On your knees!

00:55.960 --> 00:59.179
JOHN: I know exactly where we are and
where to get my next plasma ﬁx.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.339
I got big plans, big brother.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.759
You ready for a road trip?

Stop hitting yourself.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.502
Stop hitting yourself!

01:17.600 --> 01:19.306
D'avin, stop hitting yourself!

01:20.760 --> 01:22.341
Little brothers
are the worst, huh?

01:22.440 --> 01:26.217
I get it, your body's going
through a lot of changes.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.467
But you need to pull your dick
out of the Hullen puberty sock.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.381
The plan was to meet Delle
Seyah at the crash site.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.865
Plans change. Adapt or die, right?
Oh, wait.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.861
Oh, we did that
when you made me Hullen.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.666
Delle Seyah is our
best shot at curing you.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.341
She kidnapped our best friend,

01:41.440 --> 01:43.180
killed the love of my life,
and her girlfriend

01:43.280 --> 01:45.180
hijacked your DNA
to make an alien baby.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.585
So why are you trusting
anything that she says?

01:48.520 --> 01:49.862
Evil Johnny has a good point.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.699
I get it, I was dying.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.865
You had to make a hard call,
and classic D'av,

01:54.960 --> 01:56.348
you need to make
everything right.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.941
And that means finding Dutch.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.259
Well, lucky for you,
I know how to find her.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.789
H ow?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.905
All I need is a green pool
and the love in my heart.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.945
Well, John, we used
the only plasma on this planet

02:08.120 --> 02:09.781
to fix your dumb lung hole.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.462
Oh, yeah.
Except, what if we didn't?

02:12.560 --> 02:13.879
You think there's
more Green here?

02:13.960 --> 02:17.418
I don't think so, know so.
Give me 24 hours to show yo.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.627

This is our last chance
to be original JaqobIs

02:22.800 --> 02:23.983

booger comes!

02:24.120 --> 02:25.781
Just two bad-ass bros

02:25.880 --> 02:27.381
and whatever the road
throws their way.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.907
I'm hoping cheese fries.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.780
If we do this, it is straight back
to Delle Seyah at the elevator.

Please, don't provoke them.
The warden's coming.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.344
Good. I have a few harsh
words for management.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.469
Well, swallow them.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.982
Juno Clay's not a man
you want to mess with.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.344
Oh, honey, I never want
to mess with men like this,

02:55.440 --> 02:57.579

they'll never learn.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.419
They may call themselves
Killjoys,

but the only authority around
here worth a hot piss is my own.

jump on us.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.029

tO chart our green map.

landed on this skid mark.

half Of what he can dO.

going tO find Dutch?

04:13.720 --> 04:16.177
Easy breezy, Hullen squeezy.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.341
The Green is how the Hullen share their
memories, SO when I connect to it...

04:19.440 --> 04:21.419
You never said you had tO
connect tO it.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.023
If Dutch is in there, so are
the memories Of where she is.

for Dutch and Aneela

05:06.640 --> 05:07.982

05:08.120 --> 05:09.781
I'm sorry, but...

05:10.800 --> 05:14.384
Back on The RAC, it felt like
we had some kind Of

05:14.520 --> 05:17.421
desert island romance thing
going on, didn't we?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.147
Well, yeah, we thought
we were gonna die,

05:19.240 --> 05:20.741
and sex helps me think.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.906
And we did a lot Of thinking,
and it was great.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.937

and I'm just wondering,

05:29.920 --> 05:32.423
what are... What are we?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.859
Uh. I'm not lOOking
for anything more, Pip.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.423
Me neither.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.509
Yeah.
Oh. COOI!

05:39.600 --> 05:40.817
Great.
Yeah.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.746
Totally.
ldon°/o,uh,

05:42.840 --> 05:44.865
really dO relationships.
I can do sex.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.464
Lots of sex. Minimal cuddling, preferably
as little conversation as possible,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.141
helps with the, uh, thinking.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.299
Right. The thinking.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.029
But when you say, um, minimal
cuddling, does that mean...

05:56.120 --> 05:58.497
But if you're not cool
with those terms...

05:58.640 --> 06:00.267
Oh, no, I...
Cool with those terms?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.227
I'm absolutely cool
with those terms.

06:03.320 --> 06:08.383
I am in to those shenanigans.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.698
Great.
Yo, where we at on
Lucy?

06:11.320 --> 06:12.662

06:13.040 --> 06:14.428
Negativo, Chief.

Although, the good news is
nObOdy's hOOked a ship

06:16.560 --> 06:17.584
matching Lucy's description.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.545
Well, that's a problemo, hoss.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.380
Lucy's the only one
whO can follow the tracker

she shot onto that elevator.

Lucy?
NO Team Awesome Force.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.423
LOOk, Delle Seyah
was at the NecrOpOIis

06:27.520 --> 06:29.385
when Lucy was swarmed.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.784
The Armada must _have_ been
monitoring the Situation.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.581
SO?
SO, if the Armada navs

06:33.680 --> 06:35.181
are tracking the ships
that were chasing Lucy

06:35.280 --> 06:36.702
then we might have a trail
that leads us tO her.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.222
Well, even Fancy
can't figure out

06:38.320 --> 06:41.107
how the navs on this floating
armadillo work, and he was Hullen.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.384
But he never worked
on the Armada.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.259
I have to study these dOlls.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.279

06:49.480 --> 06:51.789
_ Yeah.
Pip, my room, now!

06:51.880 --> 06:56.146
Our drones will scout
sectors F-2, L-5, and R-7.

06:56.240 --> 07:00.506
We'll follow in a sweeping
pattern here, here, and here.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.784
Just keep your head down
and hope they leave soon.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.098
Head down
isn't really my thing.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.464
It messes with the crown.

those Killjoys, boys.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.459

Well, light a match
and let's see.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.263
Well, if our little slice Of mystery
doesn't come with a side of saucy.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.420
Be a peach and scooch
over there, BeaBeaDOII,

07:30.520 --> 07:32.545
I'd like tO get tO know
ourguest

07:36.160 --> 07:39.425
NO chip implant,
swanky clothes.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.305
What’s a
class
act like you doing
with a pair Of murderous Killjoys?

07:43.440 --> 07:45.180
Oh, I should have checked
their references.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.704
But then, a hint of murder's
what you want in a bodyguard.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.700
Your Killjoy's
lungs and liver?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.819
Should pay for some Of
the human fields that I lost.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.024
But that little bun
in the oven?

07:55.160 --> 07:56.707
That should cover the rest.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.586
Ah, a counter-Offer.

07:58.680 --> 08:03.663
As head Of The Nine, I can either
make you very rich or very dead.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.399
Head Of The Nine?
I don't think so.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.067
Those uppity inbreds?

08:08.160 --> 08:10.060
They don't birth their own,
they outsource.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.061
And you are a bit long in
the tooth for a surrogate.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.424
It's been a very long day.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.865
SO either get me a drink,
or get out Of my way.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.700
I think you're gonna be
staying a while.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.709
And imbibing would be unwise
in your delicate condition.

08:23.800 --> 08:28.703
Ah, there's nothing delicate
about me or my condition.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.344
Touches.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.142
Oh.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.739
Very bad move.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.904
That was better.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.220
It's like his brain is
being forced intO sleep mode.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.266
And you're sure
we don't need more straps?

09:05.720 --> 09:07.904
He has nO voluntary
motor functions, we tested.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.423
But aren't they like
super-soldiers?

09:11.880 --> 09:13.222
Leave the safety on.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.860
Better?
NO!

09:15.960 --> 09:17.427
Not... Maybe.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.899
Can you get me the adrenaline?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.264
Which one's that?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.669
The big syringe,
beside the plasma samples.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.509
Pip.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.629
Yeah...

09:35.880 --> 09:36.869
Sorry.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.680
His brainwaves keep
repeating the same pattern,

09:44.760 --> 09:46.307
like he's glitching.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.781
You tried turning him
on and Off?

09:51.240 --> 09:53.424
You're a genius.
Genius?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.147
Come on, that's... That's you.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.862

at The Company's IT department

09:57.960 --> 10:02.260
when I was 16, and I did have the
highest customer approval rating.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.345
Was Mother impressed? NO.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.817
My God, what are you doing?
Turning him Off and on.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.747
A low-level charge should interrupt
the feedback loop and reset him

10:11.160 --> 10:13.025
Any residual damage will
be healed by the parasite.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.339
Okay, just because we can
safely lobotomize somebody

10:16.440 --> 10:18.305
doesn't necessarily mean
that we should.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.186
He's not somebody,
he's Hullen.

Mmm!

tO steal Lucy,

33:49.160 --> 33:50.661
the only reason Dutch
got the drop on him

33:50.760 --> 33:52.261
was because he_ was
blasting mUSIC.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.584
Did he tell you what song
he was blasting?

33:54.720 --> 33:56.460
He sang it once.
At the Royale,
