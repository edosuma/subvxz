00:04.266 --> 00:07.999
(Cinema Epoch digital music)

00:16.166 --> 00:19.433
(intense upbeat music)

00:41.532 --> 00:43.866
(explosion)

00:44.866 --> 00:47.300
(screeching)

00:55.300 --> 00:57.999
(explosions)

00:57.999 --> 01:00.699
(intense music)

01:28.433 --> 01:30.666
(ferocious growl)

01:30.666 --> 01:33.333
(intense music)

01:43.666 --> 01:45.599
(grunts)

01:45.599 --> 01:47.966
(growling)

01:47.966 --> 01:50.367
(whimpering)

01:51.599 --> 01:54.266
(intense music)

01:59.433 --> 02:03.133
- Okay, when is the next
test subject scheduled?

02:03.133 --> 02:06.033
- She'll be here any minute.

02:06.033 --> 02:09.266
- I wanted to see at
least five subjects today.

02:09.266 --> 02:11.566
- This is less than
legal experiment.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.933
We conduct it at a
house in the woods.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.300
We pay 100 freaking dollars.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.566
It's not like we have a
giant ass list of candidates.

02:19.566 --> 02:20.966
We have one today.

02:20.966 --> 02:24.333
One desperate to do anything
for 100 bucks chick.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.566
- All right, fine.

02:25.566 --> 02:28.233
But Sandy, this
is important work

02:28.233 --> 02:31.300
so I'd appreciate a
little less attitude.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.367
- Sure thing, boss lady.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.033
- You know, I'd like
to pay them more.

02:35.033 --> 02:36.532
But the drugs for the
serum are burning through

02:36.532 --> 02:37.666
my savings so, I can't.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.433
- Some hoe's are
desperate for anything,

02:39.433 --> 02:41.766
but not five a day desperate.

02:41.766 --> 02:43.233
We got one today.

02:43.233 --> 02:44.100
She's late.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.500
(knocking on door)

02:45.500 --> 02:46.333
Oh, how's that for timing?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.333
- All right.

02:48.933 --> 02:51.632
(upbeat music)

02:51.632 --> 02:52.833
- Hey, Melinda.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.033
Finally here.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.000
Please don't embarrass me.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.933
Come on in.

03:00.133 --> 03:03.133
Melinda, this is Dr. Red.

03:03.133 --> 03:05.166
Dr. Red, this is Melinda.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.599
I don't know anything about her

03:06.599 --> 03:09.367
just that she's fit and
she needs 100 bucks.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.133
- Okay, we'll pay
after the test.

03:11.133 --> 03:12.599
Have a seat.

03:12.599 --> 03:14.000
I'm going to ask
you some questions.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.599
- I'm kind of surprised
this is in a house

03:15.599 --> 03:16.833
in the woods.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.467
I thought for sure we'd
be in a lab somewhere.

03:18.467 --> 03:20.300
(scoffs)

03:20.300 --> 03:22.333
- This is top secret, okay.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.666
Did you sign the
disclosure already?

03:24.666 --> 03:25.899
- Yeah, I did.

03:25.899 --> 03:29.166
It says you're going to
inject me with a drug.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.999
Can you tell me more about that

03:30.999 --> 03:32.666
- It's harmless, now,
I'm supposed to be

03:32.666 --> 03:34.166
the one asking the questions.

03:34.166 --> 03:34.999
Yep, okay.

03:37.266 --> 03:40.033
- Do you have a lot of
subjects that you're testing?

03:40.033 --> 03:41.799
- Maybe her ears are
clogged with wax.

03:41.799 --> 03:43.367
Didn't you hear her
say she's going to be

03:43.367 --> 03:44.866
the one asking the questions?

03:44.866 --> 03:46.066
- Yeah.

03:46.066 --> 03:48.566
I'm sorry, I'm
guess I'm nervous.

03:49.467 --> 03:50.300
Go ahead.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.233
Ask the questions.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.566
- Okay.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.699
Age?

03:54.699 --> 03:55.532
- 28.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.200
- Occupation?

03:59.367 --> 04:02.833
- I'm kind of in
between jobs right now.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.966
- Okay, what's your trade?

04:04.966 --> 04:06.233
- Trade?

04:06.233 --> 04:08.566
- Do you do physical
work or is it more,

04:08.566 --> 04:10.766
you know, the office variety?

04:10.766 --> 04:12.833
- Office variety I guess.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.033
I'm not your first subject am I?

04:18.033 --> 04:19.300
(clears throat)

04:19.300 --> 04:21.066
- Would you say you
workout more or less

04:21.066 --> 04:23.100
than three times a week?

04:23.100 --> 04:26.866
- Have you ever tested
on somebody named Kim?

04:31.400 --> 04:35.266
- Could you excuse us for
a minute please, thank you.

04:35.266 --> 04:37.833
(mellow music)

04:51.566 --> 04:53.333
- We need to get her to leave.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.999
- I agree, she asked about Kim.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.500
She's hiding something.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.200
- Do you even know
what happened to Kim?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.266
- George, it's me.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.666
I need your help, now.

05:01.666 --> 05:04.433
Yeah, I'm at the
house in the woods.

05:04.433 --> 05:05.266
Okay, bye.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.799
All right, he's on his way.

05:07.799 --> 05:09.500
- So you're going to
jam cell reception?

05:09.500 --> 05:10.866
- We need to calculate
what she knows

05:10.866 --> 05:12.532
and who she has spoken to.

05:12.532 --> 05:14.467
- And make sure she
doesn't call anyone.

05:14.467 --> 05:15.400
- Right.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.333
- What's George going to do?

05:17.333 --> 05:18.866
- Well he can help
in case there's,

05:18.866 --> 05:20.467
you know, a situation.

05:20.467 --> 05:21.833
- Did he help with Kim?

05:21.833 --> 05:23.166
- Don't worry about Kim, okay.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.966
- Look, I'm just
trying to be clear

05:24.966 --> 05:26.500
about what's going on here.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.166
I mean I can make
up some crazy shit

05:28.166 --> 05:29.933
on the spot if I have
to, but I'd rather

05:29.933 --> 05:31.699
have a little heads
up, you follow?

05:31.699 --> 05:34.766
- Mm, no, I'm not sure what
you're getting at, Sandy.

05:34.766 --> 05:38.100
- I guess what
I'm getting at is,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.833
what do you want to
do about Melinda?

05:40.833 --> 05:42.033
- Get rid of her.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.433
- You mean like dump
her in the river

05:43.433 --> 05:45.966
with cement shoes,
get rid of her?

05:45.966 --> 05:48.200
- You are so strange, Sandy.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.766
We'll just talk to her
until George arrives, okay?

05:50.766 --> 05:51.899
Let's go.

05:51.899 --> 05:54.500
(mellow music)

06:01.166 --> 06:02.632
What are you doing, Melinda?

06:02.632 --> 06:03.833
- Just looking around.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.200
- Searching for a dildo?

06:05.200 --> 06:06.933
- You guys win this award?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.333
- My friend Jane did.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.200
For her discovery of
brain eating worms.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.433
- Really?

06:11.433 --> 06:13.400
- Yeah, she had to
work really hard

06:13.400 --> 06:15.066
to get that award.

06:15.066 --> 06:16.699
You'd be amazed at
what some people

06:16.699 --> 06:18.367
have to do to
achieve their goals.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.300
- Are you ready to finish
answering our questions

06:20.300 --> 06:21.433
for the study?

06:21.433 --> 06:22.266
- No.

06:25.699 --> 06:27.200
But I'd say you are.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.866
(dramatic music)

06:29.866 --> 06:31.200
Move that chair.

06:34.632 --> 06:35.467
Sit down.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.367
Tie her up.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.799
Hurry!
- Okay.

06:41.799 --> 06:44.866
- Hey, if you want a
kinky three way, Melinda,

06:44.866 --> 06:46.833
you don't need the
gun, we're down.

06:46.833 --> 06:50.666
If it's money you're
after, we don't have any.

06:51.866 --> 06:53.300
- Get that stool.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.233
Come on!

07:01.300 --> 07:02.400
Lean over it.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.066
- It's going to be a
pretty lousy three way

07:15.066 --> 07:17.233
if we don't have our hands free.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.532
(laughs)

07:18.532 --> 07:19.766
(yells out)

07:19.766 --> 07:23.300
50 shades of ow, just
trying to keep it light.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.000
- Kim was my sister.

07:28.933 --> 07:30.400
And you're going to tell me

07:30.400 --> 07:32.799
exactly what happened to her.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.467
- We don't know what
happened to Kim.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.300
- Don't say another word, Sandy.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.233
She's not going to hurt us.

07:38.233 --> 07:39.666
- How about this.

07:40.799 --> 07:44.300
I tell you what happened
in the last moments

07:44.300 --> 07:47.866
that I saw Kim and you
fill it in from there

07:47.866 --> 07:49.467
or I will hurt you.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.799
Kim was depressed.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.133
And she needed money.

08:01.599 --> 08:05.200
And she didn't want to
come to me for help.

08:06.367 --> 08:07.500
You can't do this, Kim.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.433
You don't know enough about it.

08:09.433 --> 08:11.699
And I can set you up with a job.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.233
- I don't need your help.

08:13.233 --> 08:14.300
- Yes you do.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.866
- I can get by on my own.

08:15.866 --> 08:17.500
- What difference
does it make, Kim?

08:17.500 --> 08:18.566
We're sisters.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.933
We're family.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.566
- It's just a research study.

08:21.566 --> 08:23.200
I don't get why you're
getting all caught up

08:23.200 --> 08:24.500
about it.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.100
- Because it's very
unclear what they're

08:26.100 --> 08:27.799
going to be injecting you with.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.400
You don't know anything
about the study.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.433
And what is all this
about they're not

08:31.433 --> 08:33.033
going to give you
the location until

08:33.033 --> 08:35.166
a few minutes
before you go there?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.799
That just sounds dangerous.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.566
- Okay, maybe for
you, but I'm doing it

08:38.566 --> 08:40.367
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

08:40.367 --> 08:42.133
- Why don't we just talk it out?

08:42.133 --> 08:43.799
- Oh and when you
say talk it out

08:43.799 --> 08:46.599
you mean you talk and
I do whatever you say?

08:46.599 --> 08:47.866
- No, Kim.

08:47.866 --> 08:50.133
I really care about
what happens to you.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.266
Why don't you understand that?

08:52.266 --> 08:56.233
Since mom and dad
died, you're, (sighs).

08:56.233 --> 08:58.367
You're all I have left, Kim.

08:58.367 --> 08:59.933
- Just get out of the way.

08:59.933 --> 09:00.799
- No, Kim.

09:00.799 --> 09:02.833
Let's just talk it out.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.666
Kim!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.733
I can do this all day.

09:07.733 --> 09:09.733
(grunts)

09:09.733 --> 09:10.966
- Fine, Melinda.

09:10.966 --> 09:12.333
You can kick my ass.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.599
Is that what you want to hear?

09:13.599 --> 09:15.933
Okay, it's not going to
bring mom and dad back.

09:15.933 --> 09:17.200
- No, Kim,, please.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.799
Just, I really just
want to talk it out,

09:18.799 --> 09:20.033
that's all.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.733
- I don't want to
hear your shit.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.133
You know what, I wish
it was you who died

09:24.133 --> 09:25.467
instead of them.

09:31.733 --> 09:34.866
- The last time I
saw Kim, we fought.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.500
And I can't let that
be the last memory

09:36.500 --> 09:37.566
of my sister.

09:39.933 --> 09:41.833
So I have to find her.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.766
You have to tell
me where she is.

09:44.766 --> 09:47.066
- We don't know what happened
to your sister, okay?

09:47.066 --> 09:49.367
But you need to let
us go or we will file

09:49.367 --> 09:51.233
criminal charges against you.

09:51.233 --> 09:54.733
- You want the police
department all up in here

09:54.733 --> 09:56.766
knowing what you're doing?

09:56.766 --> 09:57.766
- I don't know, do you?

09:57.766 --> 09:59.599
- You better start talking.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.467
- You want us to sing?

10:01.467 --> 10:02.733
- Sing?

10:02.733 --> 10:04.733
- Sing, like the say in
the old gangster movies.

10:04.733 --> 10:06.766
You better start singing.

10:06.766 --> 10:07.799
Sing.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.500

10:18.200 --> 10:19.133
You don't really get the whole

10:19.133 --> 10:20.266
lighten the mood thing do ya?

10:20.266 --> 10:22.766
- I'm losing my patience here.

10:23.933 --> 10:26.966
So I'm going to count
to three and if by three

10:26.966 --> 10:30.632
you don't start talking,
I'm going to shoot.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.467
One.

10:35.066 --> 10:35.899
Two.

10:38.467 --> 10:39.300
Three.

10:40.632 --> 10:43.766
- See, I told you she
wouldn't do anything.

10:43.766 --> 10:47.333
Melinda, you are a
good person, okay?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.266
You don't want to hurt anyone.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.532
Now untie us.

10:50.532 --> 10:52.166
(screams)

10:52.166 --> 10:54.500
Oh, my God, oh, my
God you shot me.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.033
You fucking insane, you shot me.

10:56.033 --> 10:56.866
Ah!

10:57.799 --> 11:00.266
(crying)

11:00.266 --> 11:01.500
- You'll live.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.966
- My God, you shot
her in the ass.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.999
That can cause brain damage.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.467
- You want to start talking now

11:08.467 --> 11:10.200
or do you want me
to shoot you again?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.300
- Okay, okay,
okay, I will, okay.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.566
I'll tell you what I know.

11:14.566 --> 11:16.566
Oh, please, just
fix it, it hurts

11:16.566 --> 11:17.632
so God damn much.

11:17.632 --> 11:20.599
Just stop the bleeding, okay?

11:20.599 --> 11:23.632
- Fine, I'll patch
it up and then you'll

11:23.632 --> 11:25.166
start talking.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.300
- Yeah.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.500
I promise.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.333
There's a first aid
kit in the hall closet.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.066
(dramatic music)

11:36.300 --> 11:38.833
- I thought you said she
wasn't going to hurt us.

11:38.833 --> 11:40.400
It looks like it really hurts.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.899
- Will you shut up for once?

11:41.899 --> 11:44.566
(intense music)

11:46.833 --> 11:48.833
(sighs)

11:50.966 --> 11:53.632
- Well, you're good as new.

11:53.632 --> 11:55.799
(screams)

11:57.632 --> 11:58.467
- Ouch.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.033
- You better start talking.

12:08.033 --> 12:09.300
(sighs)

12:09.300 --> 12:12.100
- I don't know exactly
what happened to Kim.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.166
But she did come here.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.100
- For an experiment?

12:16.100 --> 12:17.266
- Yes.

12:17.266 --> 12:19.433
- What kind of experiment?

12:20.766 --> 12:22.133
(sighs)

12:22.133 --> 12:24.632
- Do you want the short
answer or the long one?

12:24.632 --> 12:27.166
I don't think you'll
believe either.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.033
- I want to hear everything.

12:29.033 --> 12:31.899
- Do you believe in monsters?

12:31.899 --> 12:33.799
- I'm looking at two right now.

12:33.799 --> 12:37.266
- No, I mean the kind
that live under your bed.

12:37.266 --> 12:39.233
(sighs)

12:39.233 --> 12:40.566
- I'm listening.

12:40.566 --> 12:44.467
- First time I find out
about their existence

12:44.467 --> 12:46.733
and how they came to earth.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.866
It started about five years ago.

12:51.866 --> 12:54.266
I believe aliens made
the first monsters.

12:54.266 --> 12:58.532
My theory is that they
dropped a beam into the ocean

12:58.532 --> 13:01.866
that infected the
octopus, controlled them

13:01.866 --> 13:05.000
so that they could
control humans.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.166
One attached itself to a diver

13:07.166 --> 13:09.467
and that started it all.

13:09.467 --> 13:12.133
(man screaming)

13:13.033 --> 13:15.532
(eerie music)

13:21.433 --> 13:24.699
The aliens used this method
to control the human mind.

13:24.699 --> 13:29.566
I believe their intention
was to take over our world.

13:29.566 --> 13:31.632
I knew the possessed diver.

13:31.632 --> 13:33.300
He was the foster brother of one

13:33.300 --> 13:35.100
of my sorority sisters.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.766
(intense music)

13:43.699 --> 13:46.966
I could tell something
was off about Max.

13:46.966 --> 13:49.233
But I didn't know what it was.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.966
How dangerous it
would turn out to be.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.666
And this was the
start of it all.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.200
- What are you doing, Max?

13:56.200 --> 13:57.833
You're going to
creep everyone out.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.066
- Too late.

13:59.066 --> 14:01.367
I'm already creeped
out to the max.

14:01.367 --> 14:03.899
Get it, because his name is Max?

14:03.899 --> 14:05.566
- Yeah, take off
that mask and help me

14:05.566 --> 14:07.300
with my homework.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.966
- I feel so...

14:08.966 --> 14:09.799
Strange.

14:10.966 --> 14:12.333
- Rachel, you can't
just let your brother

14:12.333 --> 14:14.300
come in here whenever he wants.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.733
What if we were like
naked or something?

14:16.733 --> 14:19.100
- Yeah, cause we all
just walk around naked

14:19.100 --> 14:20.200
all the time.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.433
Have pillow fights naked.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.467
- Come on, Alicia, stop.

14:23.467 --> 14:24.933
- Stop it before I
have to get rough

14:24.933 --> 14:25.766
with you two.

14:25.766 --> 14:27.133
- Sure thing, pint size.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.066
- Stop calling me that.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.233
- I still don't understand
how Rachel and Max

14:32.233 --> 14:34.400
can be brother and sister.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.233
What?

14:38.100 --> 14:39.833
- Are you okay, Max?

14:39.833 --> 14:43.233
- Something is trying to--

14:43.233 --> 14:44.599
- Trying to what?

14:44.599 --> 14:47.033
- Control.

14:47.033 --> 14:49.066
- Control what?

14:49.066 --> 14:50.566
- Whatever drugs you're
on, you need to share,

14:50.566 --> 14:53.100
you bad boy.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.999
- Drugs are for losers.

14:54.999 --> 14:56.000
(scoffs)

14:56.000 --> 14:56.833
- Drugs are for losers.

14:56.833 --> 14:57.666
- I'm warning you.

14:57.666 --> 14:58.500
- I'm warning you.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.532
- Oh, my God.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.632
- Ha, you're so not pretty.

15:00.632 --> 15:02.467
- Ha, you're so not pretty.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.033
- I think you just
dove too deep.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.200
You just need to get some rest.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.033
Come on.

15:10.467 --> 15:11.999
- Why is he here?

15:11.999 --> 15:13.300
- What is wrong with him?

15:13.300 --> 15:14.433
- Such a weirdo.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.933
(eerie music)

15:35.666 --> 15:37.566
- Are you going to be okay
if I let you rest here

15:37.566 --> 15:38.500
for awhile?

15:40.400 --> 15:43.333
- Yes, I must be tired.

15:44.433 --> 15:47.166
I will be acceptable
upon resting.

15:48.166 --> 15:49.666
- You're so weird.

15:50.599 --> 15:53.100
(eerie music)

16:03.632 --> 16:07.333
- [Dr. Red] That day,
the trouble began.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.999
(macabre music)

16:11.100 --> 16:12.599
- Lisa, is that you?

16:12.599 --> 16:14.033
You're not going to
scare me again, you know?

16:14.033 --> 16:16.566
And if you think about
calling me pint size,

16:16.566 --> 16:19.166
I'm going to kick
your knees out.

16:19.166 --> 16:22.766
I'm not short, you're
just freakishly tall.

16:24.133 --> 16:27.799
That's it, you're not
getting any of this dinner.

16:27.799 --> 16:30.367
You can eat shit and
die for all I care.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.467
I'm going to pound you
with this rolling pin.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.899
Oh, Max, I didn't see you there.

16:34.899 --> 16:36.467
Where did you come from?

16:36.467 --> 16:38.566
You know, you're
being so weird today.

16:38.566 --> 16:39.733
What's wrong--

16:42.400 --> 16:44.566
(gasping)

16:51.233 --> 16:53.999
(sinister music)

17:13.266 --> 17:14.766
- Is anybody home?

17:17.467 --> 17:19.333
Okay, I know someone's here.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.100
I saw Kate's car
in the driveway.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.833
Okay, if you guys are
trying to prank me

17:24.833 --> 17:27.500
with that electric vibrator
in the wheel barrow

17:27.500 --> 17:29.599
gag again, it ain't happening.

17:29.599 --> 17:31.599
I am ready for anything.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.166
(intense music)

17:40.166 --> 17:42.100
(thud)

17:56.532 --> 17:57.367
Kate!

17:58.467 --> 18:00.266
Are you all right?

18:00.266 --> 18:03.233
(suspenseful music)

18:05.500 --> 18:07.500
(gasps)

18:20.666 --> 18:22.300
- What is that smell?

18:22.300 --> 18:24.333
Did something die in here?

18:24.333 --> 18:25.766
- You sound like Kristen.

18:25.766 --> 18:28.166
She's always complaining
about some weird smell.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.966
This just happens when a
bunch of sorority girls

18:29.966 --> 18:31.632
live in the same
house with birds.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.566
- Sure, keep telling
yourself that.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.766
Oh, I am so sick of school.

18:38.766 --> 18:40.566
- It's only the first week.

18:40.566 --> 18:41.566
- Right.

18:41.566 --> 18:43.233
- Have you picked a major yet?

18:43.233 --> 18:45.066
- No, we can't all be
like my girl, Red, here.

18:45.066 --> 18:48.166
Are you going to be a mad
scientist one day, Red?

18:48.166 --> 18:49.467
- Maybe.

18:49.467 --> 18:51.066
- Don't be so modest.

18:51.066 --> 18:53.200
You're going to save
the world some day.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.899
- Or destroy it.
- Okay.

18:54.899 --> 18:57.000
- Okay, nevermind.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.566
(sighs)

18:58.566 --> 19:00.666
I wonder if Kate's
made any food yet.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.367
I'm starving like a
hobo on the beach.

19:02.367 --> 19:03.599
- I highly recommend
that you complete

19:03.599 --> 19:05.500
your homework first,
okay, before exploring

19:05.500 --> 19:06.433
our meal options.

19:06.433 --> 19:07.933
- I guess you're right.

19:07.933 --> 19:09.833
Maybe they will have
gotten rid of the smell

19:09.833 --> 19:10.666
by then.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.733
Done, dinner time.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.300
(upbeat music)

19:21.300 --> 19:23.266
What are you guys
doing, spooning?

19:23.266 --> 19:24.200
Scissoring?

19:28.433 --> 19:30.632
(screams)

19:41.333 --> 19:42.333
- They're dead.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.966
- No shit, Sherlock.

19:43.966 --> 19:46.033
- Who could've done this?

19:47.833 --> 19:51.066
Max, did you see anything?

19:51.066 --> 19:52.100
- Rachel.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.799
- No, he didn't do it.

19:53.799 --> 19:55.200
- I have a theory.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.699
- Me, too.

19:56.699 --> 19:58.266
Max flipped his fucking
brains, now he's a psycho

19:58.266 --> 19:59.533
with a knife.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.533
- Something is
controlling his mind.

20:03.866 --> 20:05.599
- Max, is that true?

20:05.599 --> 20:07.799
- You need to fight it, Max.

20:07.799 --> 20:11.500
- When I was diving, I saw

20:11.500 --> 20:15.666
a big light in the
sky, a spaceship.

20:18.500 --> 20:23.000
And then, an octopus
attached itself

20:23.000 --> 20:25.433
to my back.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.866
It kept spanking my butt.

20:30.632 --> 20:33.300
- Max, when I was a little girl,

20:34.433 --> 20:38.033
I was going from one
foster home to another.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.733
I had no one to look out for me.

20:40.733 --> 20:42.066
Until I met you.

20:43.333 --> 20:47.266
Our foster parents
weren't always around.

20:47.266 --> 20:49.233
So you ended up having
to look out for me

20:49.233 --> 20:51.233
more than you wanted to.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.533
I've always been able
to depend on you.

20:55.533 --> 20:59.367
You've been like my
father and my brother

20:59.367 --> 21:02.033
and my friend.

21:04.533 --> 21:07.699
I love you, Max and
I know you love me

21:07.699 --> 21:11.467
and I know that you
would never ever hurt me.

21:14.933 --> 21:18.066
And I know what you've
always protected me

21:18.066 --> 21:21.833
and you've always had
my back from as far back

21:21.833 --> 21:23.333
as I can remember.

21:26.233 --> 21:30.400
At school and at
home, everywhere.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.100
- It's true.

21:37.866 --> 21:40.266
I'm being controlled.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.266
It's so hard

21:42.300 --> 21:44.300
to resist this.

21:45.966 --> 21:48.200
- You have to fight it, Max.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.632
You have to for me, for me.

21:52.632 --> 21:53.966
- I can't...

21:53.966 --> 21:54.799
Hurt her.

21:55.699 --> 21:56.533
Ever.

21:59.300 --> 22:02.200
- I still remember
the day that dad left

22:02.200 --> 22:04.266
and he never came back.

22:04.266 --> 22:06.500
I was really young
but do you remember

22:06.500 --> 22:08.166
what you said to me?

22:13.733 --> 22:16.699
- Whenever you need something,

22:16.699 --> 22:19.699
someone, you never
have to look far.

22:21.566 --> 22:24.467
I'd never hurt you.

22:24.467 --> 22:26.467
- I need you, right now.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.333
- It's coming back for me.

22:37.467 --> 22:38.632
I can feel it.

22:43.933 --> 22:46.100
(screams)

22:51.433 --> 22:53.999
- Stay away from that freak.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.367
- He's unconscious.

22:55.367 --> 22:57.066
- We need to call the cops.

22:57.066 --> 22:58.266
- And say what?

22:58.266 --> 23:01.133
That an octopus latched itself

23:01.133 --> 23:03.699
onto my brother and it tried to

23:03.699 --> 23:05.699
control his mind
and make him kill

23:05.699 --> 23:07.100
our sorority sisters?

23:07.100 --> 23:09.233
- Well, he obviously went crazy.

23:09.233 --> 23:11.367
I don't want to be
here when he wakes up.

23:11.367 --> 23:12.533
- I believe him.

23:12.533 --> 23:13.799
- Of course you do.

23:13.799 --> 23:15.333
We need to leave.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.500
- We need to agree on
what to tell the police.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.533
- I don't want to be
here when he gets up.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.467
I don't care what you tell them.

23:22.467 --> 23:23.933
- It's highly
unlikely that he will

23:23.933 --> 23:25.533
try to harm us with Rachel here.

23:25.533 --> 23:27.066
- Highly unlikely,
that's reassuring.

23:27.066 --> 23:30.632
You can tell me all
about it at graduation.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.166
(sinister croaking sound)

23:39.166 --> 23:39.999
Crap.

23:44.566 --> 23:46.666
- We should go after her.

23:52.333 --> 23:53.966
- Where did Max go?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.033
We should've seen him leave.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.133
- If aliens are
involved, the rules

23:58.133 --> 23:59.966
of our world don't apply.

23:59.966 --> 24:02.632
(intense music)

24:05.733 --> 24:07.899
(screams)

24:15.000 --> 24:17.666
(intense music)

24:19.999 --> 24:24.533
- Oh, my gosh, I cannot
believe Max did this.

24:24.533 --> 24:25.533
- He didn't.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.233
Look at that bite mark.

24:32.733 --> 24:34.733
(sighs)

24:36.866 --> 24:38.699
We finally called the
police and let them

24:38.699 --> 24:40.699
make their own conclusions.

24:40.699 --> 24:42.699
They decided Max
committed the murders

24:42.699 --> 24:44.833
and fled, including
biting Lisa to death

24:44.833 --> 24:48.899
with what couldn't
possibly be human bites.

24:48.899 --> 24:51.799
And that's how it all started.

24:51.799 --> 24:55.166
- That doesn't tell
me anything about Kim.

24:55.166 --> 24:58.433
- Look, I need you to
accept their existence,

24:58.433 --> 25:01.033
because the monsters
have everything to do

25:01.033 --> 25:03.666
with what might have
happened to your sister.

25:03.666 --> 25:05.966
(sinister ambience)

25:05.966 --> 25:06.799
Shit, they're here.

25:06.799 --> 25:07.699
This isn't good.

25:07.699 --> 25:09.266
You need to let me go.

25:09.266 --> 25:10.632
- I'm not letting anyone go

25:10.632 --> 25:12.566
until you tell me
what happened to Kim.

25:12.566 --> 25:14.066
- We're going to be
those things last meal

25:14.066 --> 25:15.733
unless you let us go.

25:15.733 --> 25:17.799
How's that for an answer?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.766
- There's no signal.

25:28.766 --> 25:30.033
- Look, if those
things get in here,

25:30.033 --> 25:31.266
we're all dead.

25:31.266 --> 25:33.632
- Is that what happened to Kim?

25:33.632 --> 25:35.500
- I don't know, maybe.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.033
She left here alive, trust me.

25:38.033 --> 25:40.133
- Well, I don't trust you.

25:40.133 --> 25:43.166
And that happens
to be the problem.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.233
(grunts)

25:46.966 --> 25:47.833
You.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.899
(grunts)

26:02.166 --> 26:02.999
Who's he?

26:04.066 --> 26:05.733
- We don't know him.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.000
- Sorry, Dr. Red.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.100
You're on your own.

26:13.100 --> 26:13.933
- Shit.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.733
- You don't know him?

26:20.733 --> 26:22.333
- He works for Dr. Red.

26:22.333 --> 26:25.233
Helps her when she gets
caught with her pants down.

26:25.233 --> 26:26.500
- What was in that needle?

26:26.500 --> 26:27.433
- Serum.

26:27.433 --> 26:28.899
- Don't say any more.

26:28.899 --> 26:29.899
- Sorry, Doc.

26:29.899 --> 26:31.166
I'm not taking a bullet for you.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.400
Dr. Red says the
serum is supposed to

26:33.400 --> 26:34.966
repel the monsters.

26:36.566 --> 26:38.100
- Do you think he hurt Kim?

26:38.100 --> 26:39.400
- More than likely those
things outside did.

26:39.400 --> 26:43.333
The serum doesn't seem
to be working quite yet.

26:45.066 --> 26:47.433
- How did he get in here
with all those things

26:47.433 --> 26:48.933
outside?

26:48.933 --> 26:50.500
- I don't know, okay,
they weren't surrounding

26:50.500 --> 26:52.400
the house when I called him.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.333
Look, we don't control
the creatures yet.

26:54.333 --> 26:55.966
That's the problem.

26:55.966 --> 26:56.799
- Listen.

26:59.866 --> 27:01.433
- I don't hear anything.

27:01.433 --> 27:03.133
- That's the problem.

27:03.133 --> 27:04.300
For George.

27:04.300 --> 27:07.033
(dramatic music)

27:16.666 --> 27:18.733
(grunts)

27:20.367 --> 27:22.533
(yelling)

27:32.367 --> 27:34.100
- No more bullshit.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.166
What happened to Kim?

27:36.166 --> 27:37.632
- She came for the experiment.

27:37.632 --> 27:38.866
We gave her that injection.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.233
She left, that's all we know.

27:40.233 --> 27:41.500
Believe me.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.467
- I don't believe
anything you say.

27:43.467 --> 27:44.733
What happened to Kim?

27:44.733 --> 27:46.300
- She did come here
for the experiment.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.266
And like I said, Dr.
Red's serum is said

27:48.266 --> 27:50.166
to repel the monsters.

27:50.166 --> 27:52.333
She left here, just
like George did.

27:52.333 --> 27:55.333
- Do you think
those things outside

27:55.333 --> 27:56.566
killed her?

27:56.566 --> 27:59.933
- So you believe that
there are monsters?

28:01.500 --> 28:05.666
- What are the chances
that she could've survived?

28:06.933 --> 28:09.500
- I can show you some
footage of the sort

28:09.500 --> 28:10.999
of things she was up against.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.233
- Footage?

28:12.233 --> 28:15.333
- Yeah, take these
off, I'll show you.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.333
Come on.

28:19.333 --> 28:20.566
I can't exactly run away.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.100
You shot me in the
gluteus maximus.

28:22.100 --> 28:25.433
- Ha, she means you
shot her in the ass.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.566
(grunts)

28:55.999 --> 28:58.300
- These are the kinds of
monsters we've encountered

28:58.300 --> 28:59.599
thus far.

28:59.599 --> 29:01.300
- They look fake.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.899
- Well, this is a simulation.

29:03.899 --> 29:05.833
That's why the government
didn't believe us either, okay?

29:05.833 --> 29:08.233
They refused to fund
our experiments.

29:08.233 --> 29:12.200
- What are you trying
to study exactly?

29:12.200 --> 29:14.833
- What attracts the monsters
and what repels them.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.300
- Hey.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.666
They way you went
all ninja on George's

29:17.666 --> 29:19.500
pathetic ass, are you
a cop or something?

29:19.500 --> 29:22.766
- I do work in law enforcement.

29:22.766 --> 29:25.899
But I am here as Kim's sister.

29:25.899 --> 29:28.266
I'm here to find out
exactly what happened

29:28.266 --> 29:29.266
to her.

29:29.266 --> 29:33.266
I need to know if she's alive.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.533
- Look, Melinda, we
need to do something

29:39.533 --> 29:41.999
before those things get in here.

29:41.999 --> 29:43.833
- I don't care if
they get in here

29:43.833 --> 29:45.066
and kill us all.

29:45.066 --> 29:46.866
You need to understand that.

29:46.866 --> 29:48.500
I'm not letting you guys go

29:48.500 --> 29:50.966
until I'm satisfied that I know

29:50.966 --> 29:53.632
everything I need
to know about Kim.

29:53.632 --> 29:55.467
And I'm not satisfied.

29:55.467 --> 29:57.599
- Okay look, I told
you she came here,

29:57.599 --> 29:59.866
we tested her and she left.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.433
- What kind of test did you do

30:01.433 --> 30:02.699
besides the shot?

30:02.699 --> 30:04.333
- We asked her the same
questions we asked you,

30:04.333 --> 30:05.599
that's all.

30:05.599 --> 30:06.899
- Bullshit.

30:06.899 --> 30:08.500
Tell me more about the serum.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.899
- Dr. Red believes that
if you give someone

30:10.899 --> 30:12.000
a small--

30:12.000 --> 30:13.433
- Don't say a word, Sandy.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.066
- Tell me more, Sandy.

30:15.066 --> 30:16.367
- First you need to know about

30:16.367 --> 30:18.266
the brain eating worms.

30:21.133 --> 30:24.367
Jane was a scientist,
not a very good one.

30:24.367 --> 30:27.200
Her coworker, Amy was
basically an evil genius.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.033
While Jane watched her,
Amy made a breakthrough

30:29.033 --> 30:32.066
that was the beginning of
Dr. Red's secret serum.

30:32.066 --> 30:33.699
It all centered
around Amy's discovery

30:33.699 --> 30:35.367
in the swamp that day.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.233
Did dim witted Jane
drive Amy to became

30:37.233 --> 30:40.200
and insane murderer who
used brain eating worms

30:40.200 --> 30:41.433
to kill for her?

30:41.433 --> 30:42.933
Perhaps.

30:44.533 --> 30:45.866
- Whatcha doin'?

30:47.999 --> 30:51.533
- Looking for the
amoeba that we're here

30:51.533 --> 30:52.766
to try to find.

30:54.899 --> 30:58.433
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

30:58.433 --> 30:59.266
- Okay.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.233
(clears throat)

31:10.233 --> 31:12.500
While our first
three water samples

31:12.500 --> 31:16.266
proved negative, our
fourth is positive

31:16.266 --> 31:18.100
for naegleria fowleri.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.066
Look.

31:22.066 --> 31:23.200
- Yeah, let me take
a look at this thing.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.599
- Okay, look.

31:26.899 --> 31:28.233
(clears throat)

31:28.233 --> 31:30.966
- I don't see anything.

31:30.966 --> 31:33.433
Ow, okay.
- With your eyes.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.599
Okay, now, here's the
interesting thing.

31:36.599 --> 31:40.166
Naegleria fowleri,
just look through.

31:40.166 --> 31:44.100
Normally it's bacteria.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.866
But when it manages
to find its way

31:45.866 --> 31:48.599
into a human host,
it uses the brain

31:48.599 --> 31:49.866
as a food source.

31:49.866 --> 31:53.133
- Oh, wow.

31:53.133 --> 31:54.833
- The nose is the
passageway for the amoeba

31:54.833 --> 31:56.833
to enter the human body so,

31:56.833 --> 31:59.467
infection is most likely
to occur if the host

31:59.467 --> 32:01.599
has been swimming, diving,

32:01.599 --> 32:04.833
water skiing, any
kind of water sport

32:04.833 --> 32:07.333
where the water is forced
in the nasal passageway

32:07.333 --> 32:09.533
carrying that little
amoeba with it.

32:09.533 --> 32:11.433
- It's gnarly.
- Uh huh.

32:12.599 --> 32:14.899
- Yikes, I can't imagine
water skiing in here.

32:14.899 --> 32:17.433
Well, I wonder--

32:17.433 --> 32:18.899
- It was an example.

32:18.899 --> 32:22.799
- I wonder if this little sucker

32:22.799 --> 32:26.066
would eat fat cells
because I am interested

32:26.066 --> 32:28.599
if he'll eat the
fat out of my body.

32:28.599 --> 32:31.999
He, she, whatever these
little guys are, you know.

32:31.999 --> 32:35.433
- My hypothesis is
that we're going to be

32:35.433 --> 32:37.233
seeing more and more
of these every year

32:37.233 --> 32:38.766
as the climate
begins to get warmer,

32:38.766 --> 32:40.699
especially here in Los Angeles.

32:40.699 --> 32:41.966
Hey, do me a favor.

32:41.966 --> 32:43.999
Hand me one one of
those petri dishes.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.400
I want to collect some of these

32:45.400 --> 32:47.033
and take them back to the lab.

32:47.033 --> 32:49.100
- Okay.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.999
Sure, let me make a little room.

32:54.899 --> 32:57.100
- Okay, first of all,
that's disgusting.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.766
Second of all, not a petri dish.

33:01.033 --> 33:04.066
- Sorry, you must be
talking about this--

33:04.066 --> 33:05.367
- There you go.

33:05.367 --> 33:06.200
- Okay.

33:09.333 --> 33:12.666
- Hold on, let me get
a little bit more.

33:13.632 --> 33:15.200
Okay.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.200
There we go.

33:17.233 --> 33:19.200
- So just take, lick it.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.666
- No, no, no.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.433
(laughs)

33:22.433 --> 33:23.599
Really?

33:23.599 --> 33:25.133
I just told you it
enters the body through

33:25.133 --> 33:27.200
an orifice and it eats
the brain and you're

33:27.200 --> 33:28.632
going to lick it.

33:29.533 --> 33:30.666
Okay, no, put--

33:30.666 --> 33:31.699
- Don't do it.
- Right.

33:31.699 --> 33:32.599
Don't do it.

33:32.599 --> 33:33.866
Okay, close it up.

33:33.866 --> 33:35.367
We're going to take
it back to the lab,

33:35.367 --> 33:36.766
we're going to look at it under

33:36.766 --> 33:37.599
the high-powered microscope.

33:37.599 --> 33:38.433
Okay?

33:38.433 --> 33:39.266
- Sure.
- Okay.

33:39.266 --> 33:40.200
Excellent.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.367
All right, let's pack up.

33:41.367 --> 33:44.300
- What about those
little wormy guys there?

33:44.300 --> 33:45.266
Throw one in.

33:45.266 --> 33:47.333
- A worm?

33:47.333 --> 33:49.033
- Yeah, worms.

33:49.033 --> 33:51.100
Yeah.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.266
- Oh, okay.

33:52.266 --> 33:54.733
Great, sure, why not?

33:54.733 --> 33:55.566
Okay.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.699
- See if you can survive this

34:01.699 --> 34:04.133
little bit of vodka in here.

34:04.133 --> 34:07.966
- Okay.
- What?

34:07.966 --> 34:10.100
- Uh, this little--

34:10.100 --> 34:11.699
- Oh, my God.

34:11.699 --> 34:12.766
- Okay, get the lid.

34:12.766 --> 34:14.100
Are you ready?

34:14.100 --> 34:16.033
- Yeah, oh yeah.

34:16.033 --> 34:17.500
- Okay, one, two, three.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.733
- Oh, oh, oops.

34:18.733 --> 34:20.166
(laughs)

34:20.166 --> 34:20.999
There we go, oh, oh.

34:20.999 --> 34:21.899
Get back in there.

34:21.899 --> 34:23.133
Come on little guy.

34:23.133 --> 34:24.933
I know the vodka's
getting you frisky.

34:24.933 --> 34:26.100
- Okay, there we go.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.166
- There we go.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.400
- All right.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.066
Now that you have
your little pet.

34:31.066 --> 34:33.666
You ready to go back to the lab?

34:33.666 --> 34:35.100
- Let's go, yeah.

34:42.467 --> 34:43.300
- Oh, god.

34:46.766 --> 34:48.300
- [Sandy] There was
a race to discover

34:48.300 --> 34:50.033
a practical use for
the worms before their

34:50.033 --> 34:53.166
rivals at the lab
called Hard Tech.

34:53.166 --> 34:55.200
Amy worked hard to
create a serum that would

34:55.200 --> 34:58.367
transform the worms and
embellish their powers.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.100
- Yo, whatcha doin'?

35:02.100 --> 35:04.467
- I can't wait to show
this to Dr. Fouley.

35:04.467 --> 35:06.866
I mean this could be
my big breakthrough.

35:06.866 --> 35:10.733
- Yeah, Dr. Fouley does
love new discoveries,

35:10.733 --> 35:14.467
especially because it
brings in new investors

35:17.200 --> 35:20.799
and hopefully that's
the next big Viagra like

35:20.799 --> 35:23.033
sexual performance drug.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.467
- Okay, I get that
worms are phallic

35:25.467 --> 35:29.300
but why does everything
turn phallic with you?

35:30.632 --> 35:32.133
(sighs)

35:32.133 --> 35:34.333
Okay, you know what, I'm
not even going to bother.

35:34.333 --> 35:38.333
I, (sighs) I'm not
going to engage you,

35:38.333 --> 35:41.699
you are just here.

35:41.699 --> 35:45.766
- Well, I am having a big
Halloween costume party

35:46.933 --> 35:50.733
and everyone from the
lab should be there,

35:50.733 --> 35:55.400
including Dr. Fouley who's
supposed to be making

35:55.400 --> 35:59.467
a big announcement.

35:59.467 --> 36:03.966
And even members
from the rival lab,

36:03.966 --> 36:06.433
Hard Tech.

36:06.433 --> 36:09.133
- Well, I suppose I could go.

36:09.133 --> 36:13.632
For a little while, but
for science, of course.

36:13.632 --> 36:18.233
- Hmm, really, I thought you
weren't engaging me anymore.

36:18.233 --> 36:22.066
- I was trying out a
new experiment see,

36:22.066 --> 36:25.133
where I say something
I don't really mean

36:25.133 --> 36:28.033
just to be able to predict
and gauge your reaction.

36:28.033 --> 36:29.966
- Mm-hmm.

36:34.799 --> 36:36.066
(sighs)

36:36.066 --> 36:37.866
I am so sick of Amy,
she is such a snob.

36:37.866 --> 36:42.266
She can get her point across
without being so snide.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.999
I get that she's smart
and all and she wants

36:43.999 --> 36:45.200
everyone to--

36:45.200 --> 36:47.933
- Whatever you say, Poopsie.

36:47.933 --> 36:51.566
So, you said something
about how you found

36:51.566 --> 36:55.166
some worms that you
might be able to grind up

36:55.166 --> 36:59.133
and turn into sexual
enhancement supplements?

36:59.133 --> 37:01.400
- Well, yeah, so I
did find some worms

37:01.400 --> 37:05.433
in the worms, but you
know what, worms are kind

37:05.433 --> 37:08.666
of like disjointed
wieners without a body.

37:08.666 --> 37:10.966
I mean, it's probably what
happens to the baby dick

37:10.966 --> 37:12.367
if a baby dies.

37:12.367 --> 37:13.733
They turn into worms.

37:13.733 --> 37:15.033
So maybe--

37:15.033 --> 37:17.566
- You're lucky I had
a drinking problem.

37:17.566 --> 37:20.599
- Oh, that you do.

37:20.599 --> 37:24.699
Seems to me like you have
a laughing gas problem.

37:27.033 --> 37:28.766
(laughing)

37:28.766 --> 37:31.333
- Bring me those worms.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.699
We need to milk this
before Hard Tech

37:34.699 --> 37:36.933
finds these.

37:36.933 --> 37:39.966
- That laughing gas
is only for surgeries.

37:39.966 --> 37:43.333
(cell phone music)

37:43.333 --> 37:44.566
- Hello.

37:44.566 --> 37:47.566
Yes, I told you not
to call me here.

37:51.899 --> 37:55.733
Yes, okay, I will be there.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.266
- Amy, if you're going to
come to the party tonight,

37:58.266 --> 38:00.866
could you bring some
snacks or brewski's?

38:00.866 --> 38:04.500
- Okay, I've got to go,
I'll talk to you later.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.899
Yeah, sure.

38:05.899 --> 38:08.233
Jane, you know what, I can bring

38:08.233 --> 38:12.000
something really tasty
tonight, in fact, I'm going to

38:12.000 --> 38:14.799
go whip you up a
sample right now.

38:14.799 --> 38:16.433
- Fuck that was good.

38:16.433 --> 38:17.833
(laughing)

38:17.833 --> 38:18.666
Hey.

38:22.166 --> 38:24.467
I could use a treat, yeah.

38:24.467 --> 38:26.467
(sighs)

38:29.166 --> 38:31.899
(dramatic music)

38:33.033 --> 38:36.100
- I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.933
That moron actually
thinks that these worms

38:38.933 --> 38:40.766
help with erections.

38:40.766 --> 38:43.599
All he ever cares about
these days is boners

38:43.599 --> 38:46.300
and boner pills.

38:46.300 --> 38:50.866
Oh yeah, and fowleri eating
your happens to give you

38:50.866 --> 38:54.400
an erection at the
same time, then well,

38:54.400 --> 38:56.066
lucky you.

38:56.066 --> 38:57.533
(sighs)

38:57.533 --> 39:00.200
I cannot let this discovery
slip through my fingers

39:00.200 --> 39:03.400
especially not to
that half wit harlot.

39:04.367 --> 39:06.367
(sighs)

39:12.066 --> 39:12.999
Here we go.

39:14.266 --> 39:16.066
- [Jane] What is that?

39:16.066 --> 39:18.533
- That snack is health food.

39:18.533 --> 39:22.233
- Ew, I hate health food.

39:22.233 --> 39:23.400
- I'll eat it.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.467
Mm.
- Mm.

39:30.467 --> 39:32.699
(laughing)

39:37.233 --> 39:41.166
Hmm, oh, oh.

39:41.166 --> 39:42.733
I feel horny.

39:42.733 --> 39:45.033
- Okay, I'm going
to take a break.

39:45.033 --> 39:46.933
- Whatever you say, Jane.

39:46.933 --> 39:49.833
- You've been working
for like two hours.

39:49.833 --> 39:51.533
- Yeah, well, if
you're bringing that

39:51.533 --> 39:52.966
to the party, then
I'm going to have

39:52.966 --> 39:54.400
to buy some other food.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.467
I've got a party to plan.

39:57.599 --> 39:59.866
(laughing)

40:02.333 --> 40:03.333
- For later.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.766
- Those two bimbos
are so stupid.

40:18.766 --> 40:22.467
They won't even have
any idea that they're

40:22.467 --> 40:23.699
being recorded.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.500
Think you can take credit
for my discovery, Jane?

40:31.500 --> 40:35.166
Well, we will just see
about that, won't we?

40:38.733 --> 40:39.566
All right.

40:44.933 --> 40:46.599
Perfect.

40:46.599 --> 40:49.266
(intense music)

40:51.699 --> 40:54.699
(cell phone chimes)

41:01.733 --> 41:03.433
- Yeah, I'll meet
you at the party.

41:03.433 --> 41:04.666
(sighs)

41:04.666 --> 41:06.866
Thanks so much for
helping me get ready

41:06.866 --> 41:08.166
for this party.

41:08.166 --> 41:11.733
It's hard work blowing
up so many balloons.

41:13.799 --> 41:15.033
(sighs)

41:15.033 --> 41:16.500
I wonder who's going to
win my costume contest

41:16.500 --> 41:17.733
this year.

41:17.733 --> 41:20.799
Last year it was a
tie between Bigfoot

41:20.799 --> 41:22.300
and an actual dog.

41:23.233 --> 41:24.866
Yikes!

41:24.866 --> 41:27.367
- Yeah, but you
invited that girl, Amy

41:27.367 --> 41:29.300
to the party and I just
can't believe that.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.733
She's a total drag.

41:30.733 --> 41:34.433
That's like inviting
your priest to your orgy.

41:34.433 --> 41:37.233
- Well, I see your
point, but Amy,

41:37.233 --> 41:40.933
she's really smart,
she works with me

41:40.933 --> 41:42.599
so I can't not invite
her to the party

41:42.599 --> 41:44.133
and Dad loves her.

41:44.133 --> 41:46.300
So I have to invite Amy.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.933
- Oh, maybe your dad
wants you to be more

41:48.933 --> 41:53.033
like Amy, she's such
a smarty pants like,

41:53.033 --> 41:56.966
hi, I'm Amy and I discovered

41:56.966 --> 41:59.500
that there's worms
that come out of

41:59.500 --> 42:01.367
my crotch and it took
me awhile to figure

42:01.367 --> 42:05.533
this out because I'm always
looking into microscopes.

42:06.567 --> 42:09.699
- Hmm, you have a point.

42:09.699 --> 42:12.567
Maybe Dad wants me to go
back to science school

42:12.567 --> 42:16.500
and to get really into
this whole sciencey thing.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.899
Huh, but ever since
they tested on me,

42:19.899 --> 42:23.966
I've decided I am not going
back to science school.

42:23.966 --> 42:27.100
- Oh, I would love
to get tested on,

42:27.100 --> 42:29.066
like I'm so sick of my
job at The Exotic Garden.

42:29.066 --> 42:30.699
I'm bored without you.

42:30.699 --> 42:34.100
Uh, and business has
been so dead ever since

42:34.100 --> 42:36.699
that one girl got
crucified by a cactus

42:36.699 --> 42:39.266
and I don't think
people get the whole

42:39.266 --> 42:41.500
business model of a
strip club that also

42:41.500 --> 42:42.899
sells plants.

42:42.899 --> 42:46.500
- You know, it is botanical
business blasphemy.

42:46.500 --> 42:50.567
And it is a strange
concept having strippers

42:50.567 --> 42:52.632
that sell plants.

42:52.632 --> 42:55.699
Especially since the
place is haunted.

42:55.699 --> 42:58.133
(upbeat music)

42:58.133 --> 43:01.166
- Stop working at
fucking The Exotic Garden

43:01.166 --> 43:04.233
or I'll kill you.

43:06.467 --> 43:07.866
(sighs)

43:07.866 --> 43:10.567
- Well, I think the concept
of The Exotic Garden

43:10.567 --> 43:13.799
is just too modern
for our times.

43:13.799 --> 43:17.433
- Well, I'm so sorry I
can't come to the party

43:17.433 --> 43:21.233
but who else is going to
fertilize the black dahlia's?

43:21.233 --> 43:25.066
I hope Amy isn't such
a drag at your party

43:25.066 --> 43:27.766
and doesn't bore it down.

43:27.766 --> 43:30.766
Maybe these balloons
will keep the mood

43:30.766 --> 43:32.666
livened up from Amy.

43:32.666 --> 43:34.833
- What are you working on, Amy?

43:34.833 --> 43:36.533
(laughs)

43:36.533 --> 43:38.400
- You really want to know?

43:38.400 --> 43:39.699
- Yes, of course.

43:39.699 --> 43:43.666
- Well, you wanted me
to work on these worm

43:43.666 --> 43:45.333
extracts, right?

43:45.333 --> 43:46.166
- Mm-hmm.

43:47.367 --> 43:49.567
- You know these worms
can eat brains, right?

43:49.567 --> 43:51.799
- Well, I'm more
concerned about how they

43:51.799 --> 43:54.599
can improve sexual enhancement.

43:54.599 --> 43:57.100
That's where the real money is.

43:57.100 --> 43:59.500
- Well.
(laughs)

43:59.500 --> 44:01.733
I'm also working on
a drug that could

44:01.733 --> 44:05.166
increase the overall
size and strength.

44:05.166 --> 44:07.833
- Bigger erections.

44:07.833 --> 44:10.733
- I don't think it
can be centralized

44:10.733 --> 44:11.999
in that fashion.

44:11.999 --> 44:15.200
No, it would increase
the overall size

44:15.200 --> 44:18.033
of the organism and
also likely turn

44:18.033 --> 44:19.733
the life force aggressive.

44:19.733 --> 44:20.966
- Amazon women.

44:20.966 --> 44:24.166
- Well I think the more
practical utilization

44:24.166 --> 44:26.866
would be to increase the
size of our vegetables

44:26.866 --> 44:29.966
so that we can enhance
our nations food supply.

44:29.966 --> 44:31.632
- Let me know when
you get further along

44:31.632 --> 44:34.100
on the worm extraction
that improves

44:34.100 --> 44:36.866
sexual performance.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.766
- Fine.

44:41.766 --> 44:45.333
- I have to go to my office.

44:46.433 --> 44:48.899
No matter what strange
sounds you hear

44:48.899 --> 44:52.533
in there, don't come in
for the next 10 minutes

44:52.533 --> 44:55.766
or so, understand?

44:55.766 --> 44:59.833
- Trust me, I understand.

45:02.999 --> 45:05.000
(barks)

45:10.233 --> 45:12.500
(knocking)

45:20.599 --> 45:22.033
- Get on your knees.

45:22.033 --> 45:24.333
- Oh oh, don't yell at me.

45:24.333 --> 45:25.166
- Grovel.

45:26.666 --> 45:28.066
Grovel.

45:28.066 --> 45:30.766
- Oh, okay.

45:30.766 --> 45:32.533
- I'm the boss now.

45:32.533 --> 45:35.200
- Oh, oh, yeah, you're the boss.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.500
- Now don't touch me.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.733
- Oh, oh, oh.

45:37.733 --> 45:39.833
- Don't touch me,
you are going to

45:39.833 --> 45:42.100
relinquish all control.

45:42.100 --> 45:45.866
- I am so happy, so lucky

45:45.866 --> 45:47.699
to serve you.

45:47.699 --> 45:49.666
- [Snow] Shut up and
put this mask on.

45:49.666 --> 45:53.033
Stop touching me or
I'm going to beat you.

45:53.033 --> 45:55.233
(panting)

45:55.233 --> 45:57.333
- You know what I like--

45:57.333 --> 45:58.666
- On your knees.

45:58.666 --> 46:00.733
- You know I like it rough.

46:00.733 --> 46:01.699
- Put it on.

46:03.266 --> 46:05.799
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

46:05.799 --> 46:07.200
Hold on, hold on.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.100
Oh, it's the kitty mask.

46:08.100 --> 46:09.567
- Yeah, yeah.

46:09.567 --> 46:11.433
Come on, come on, here,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

46:11.433 --> 46:12.733
Right here.

46:12.733 --> 46:14.033
(cries out)

46:14.033 --> 46:16.467
- Oh, oh.
(panting)

46:16.467 --> 46:17.733
Oh!

46:17.733 --> 46:18.999
- [Snow] Stop touching me.

46:18.999 --> 46:21.133
On the horse, you're
being a naughty boy.

46:21.133 --> 46:23.200
- No, no.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.367
- On the horse.

46:24.367 --> 46:25.966
- Okay, okay, okay.

46:28.567 --> 46:30.033
- Bend over.

46:30.033 --> 46:32.066
- Oh, no, no.
- Down.

46:32.066 --> 46:34.799
(yelling)

46:34.799 --> 46:37.133
(screaming)

46:38.799 --> 46:42.200
You are such a bad, bad boy.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.632
- I'm a bad, bad boy.
- Get down.

46:43.632 --> 46:46.400
Like a worm, like
the worm you are.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.866
- I'm a worm, I'm a worm.

46:47.866 --> 46:49.066
I'm a big worm.

46:49.066 --> 46:52.133
- Great big,
disgusting, whiny worm.

46:52.133 --> 46:54.266
Shut up and get back
down on the ground.

46:54.266 --> 46:57.699
Whiny, disgusting worm.

46:57.699 --> 47:00.266
- Don't put me in the cage.

47:00.266 --> 47:01.433
No.

47:01.433 --> 47:02.567
- Into the cage for you.

47:02.567 --> 47:05.033
- Oh, oh, no.

47:05.033 --> 47:08.367
- Into the cage, don't
make me beat you more.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.033
Get in the cage.

47:10.033 --> 47:11.899
- Okay, I'm in the cage.

47:11.899 --> 47:12.933
Don't, don't, don't.

47:12.933 --> 47:13.766
- Get in.

47:13.766 --> 47:14.699
- Don't, ow.

47:14.699 --> 47:15.933
- Get in.
- Ow.

47:15.933 --> 47:18.433
- Don't make me strike harder.

47:19.933 --> 47:22.599
Get in there, you filthy animal.

47:24.433 --> 47:27.567
- Oh no, no, oh.

47:27.567 --> 47:30.100
(whimpering)

47:30.100 --> 47:31.899
- Throw away the key.

47:31.899 --> 47:34.666
(Fouley yelling)

47:37.133 --> 47:39.300
(moaning)

47:42.899 --> 47:45.467
(upbeat music)

47:50.100 --> 47:52.066
- [Sandy] When the party
got started that night,

47:52.066 --> 47:54.733
it was the beginning of the end.

48:00.233 --> 48:02.567
- I brought some
dip to the party.

48:02.567 --> 48:04.033
I heard your company
stumbled upon some

48:04.033 --> 48:07.266
cerebral cortex
consuming amoebas.

48:07.266 --> 48:10.200
- That's the thing about rumors.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.133
Details always change.

48:12.133 --> 48:13.833
That's why I don't
believe anything

48:13.833 --> 48:15.333
unless I see it on the news.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.567
Then it's real.

48:16.567 --> 48:18.333
- Interesting, I've been
doing some experiments

48:18.333 --> 48:20.833
with a similar species
with my own company.

48:20.833 --> 48:22.966
We'll be very excited to
read your research thesis

48:22.966 --> 48:24.567
on the discovery.

48:24.567 --> 48:26.899
(sighs)

48:26.899 --> 48:28.799
- Yeah, well I bet
our worms are bigger

48:28.799 --> 48:32.632
than yours and our worms
are for sexual enhancements.

48:32.632 --> 48:36.100
- I wonder if they'll
make everyone horny.

48:36.100 --> 48:38.766
Everyone can use a
little pick me up.

48:38.766 --> 48:41.000
Good thing they aren't
here, freak me out.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.300
But maybe I can get over my
fear if they make me horny.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.866
- The possibilities with
discovery can all be

48:47.866 --> 48:49.133
quite different.

48:49.133 --> 48:51.233
It would be interesting to see,

48:51.233 --> 48:54.033
could be that sexual
enhancement is a result

48:54.033 --> 48:55.500
that transpires.

48:55.500 --> 48:59.467
Hopefully that it's going
to be a positive one,

48:59.467 --> 49:01.433
not a destructive one.

49:01.433 --> 49:04.599
- Shawn just texted me.

49:04.599 --> 49:05.933
I'll be right back.

49:05.933 --> 49:08.533
(upbeat music)

49:13.266 --> 49:15.433
(panting)

49:16.733 --> 49:17.567
- Oh.

49:21.599 --> 49:25.799
What a terrific interview.

49:25.799 --> 49:29.799
This new hire will add a lot to

49:31.233 --> 49:32.999
our company.

49:34.033 --> 49:36.100
- I heard your interview.

49:38.266 --> 49:41.866
You know what, sure.

49:41.866 --> 49:46.000
I will take care of her.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.766
Don't you worry about anything.

49:47.766 --> 49:51.266
- I'll play the old
mad scientist role,

49:51.266 --> 49:54.467
easy peasy.

49:54.467 --> 49:55.300
- Right.

49:56.833 --> 50:01.300
Well, um, you better
go catch your taxi.

50:01.300 --> 50:04.200
- Hmm, oh, oh.
- Your taxi's waiting for you.

50:04.200 --> 50:07.699
Yeah, don't you worry
about anything here.

50:07.699 --> 50:09.699
I've got it all handled.

50:17.766 --> 50:21.933
Now I'm going to administer
the true discovery.

50:23.899 --> 50:25.567
This...

50:27.966 --> 50:30.733
Is a brain eating amoeba.

50:30.733 --> 50:32.467
(squealing)

50:32.467 --> 50:35.467
See if we can find it the way.

50:35.467 --> 50:37.733
(laughing)

50:42.467 --> 50:45.632
Yeah, this is taking
too long already.

50:47.166 --> 50:48.999
I think I'm just going to speed

50:48.999 --> 50:51.533
this whole process
up a little bit.

50:51.533 --> 50:54.133
(squealing)

50:54.133 --> 50:55.467
All worms on deck.

50:55.467 --> 50:57.699
(laughing)

50:59.100 --> 51:02.100
(suspenseful music)

51:06.833 --> 51:11.467
Snow, not normally
one for costume

51:11.467 --> 51:14.133
or fashion.

51:15.033 --> 51:18.300
But, these boots.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.400
I like them.

51:23.166 --> 51:24.266
And they fit.

51:25.467 --> 51:29.433
I think these will be
the perfect accessory

51:31.300 --> 51:34.567
for Jane's little
costume party tonight.

51:34.567 --> 51:36.632
What do you think?

51:36.632 --> 51:38.733
(laughs)

51:41.632 --> 51:42.766
(meows)

51:42.766 --> 51:44.999
(laughing)

51:51.533 --> 51:54.367
- Sweet pad but where
are the video games?

51:54.367 --> 51:56.233
You can't expect us
to actually dance

51:56.233 --> 51:58.400
and talk to people,
cause I'm not doing that.

51:58.400 --> 51:59.799
- Yeah, they can't have a party

51:59.799 --> 52:01.266
without proper video games.

52:01.266 --> 52:02.866
How am I supposed to get babes

52:02.866 --> 52:05.033
by showing my gaming skills?

52:05.033 --> 52:06.433
- Skills, yeah.

52:06.433 --> 52:09.699
- What are you supposed
to be, Dr. Firecrotch?

52:09.699 --> 52:10.933
Nice boots.

52:10.933 --> 52:13.300
You look like a
gigantic monster.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.866
Did you steal those off a
dead hooker or something?

52:15.866 --> 52:19.133
- I'm actually dressed
as myself, a scientist.

52:19.133 --> 52:22.699
You must be one of Jane's
nincompoop friends.

52:22.699 --> 52:25.333
- Wait, what kind
of party is this?

52:25.333 --> 52:28.500
First there's no video
games and now nincompoop.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.699
There's going to be poop here.

52:30.699 --> 52:34.166
- Oh what, that would
be a party pooper.

52:34.166 --> 52:36.833
It's going to get weird fast.

52:36.833 --> 52:37.766
(sighs)

52:37.766 --> 52:39.200
- I've got to go to the restroom

52:39.200 --> 52:40.300
and fix my costume.

52:40.300 --> 52:42.367
I'll be back in a minute.

52:43.533 --> 52:44.632
- And you brought
up pooper again

52:44.632 --> 52:45.999
after they said poop.

52:45.999 --> 52:47.233
You must have a thing for it.

52:47.233 --> 52:48.166
- I do watch some
scat sometimes.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.333
- Yeah.
- You know.

52:49.333 --> 52:51.333
- Yeah you are wearing
a dickhead hat.

52:51.333 --> 52:52.333
- Yeah, it's okay.

52:52.333 --> 52:54.733
(dark music)

53:15.733 --> 53:17.833
- Hello, idiot.

53:24.699 --> 53:29.100
I'm so sick and tired
of brainless bimbos

53:29.100 --> 53:32.400
like you having all the
confidence in the world

53:32.400 --> 53:35.899
and to act so utterly
and completely rude.

53:38.766 --> 53:42.933
I would like to introduce
you to my friend.

53:47.166 --> 53:50.733
Luna, meet N. Fowleri.

53:50.733 --> 53:53.567
Oh, he is a little hungry.

53:53.567 --> 53:55.567
Let's see.

54:00.599 --> 54:03.033
Oh, there you go.

54:03.033 --> 54:05.166
(laughing)

54:05.166 --> 54:08.166
And now you hardly
know this guy, right?

54:08.166 --> 54:11.100
(laughing)

54:11.100 --> 54:15.266
I know, you don't have a lot
to munch on in there, do you?

54:17.100 --> 54:18.367
You know what?

54:18.367 --> 54:21.866
This party is going
to be fun after all.

54:21.866 --> 54:24.100
(laughing)

54:28.933 --> 54:30.933
Now what to do with you.

54:32.599 --> 54:34.166
You know what?

54:34.166 --> 54:38.033
You are such a lush,
all of your friends are

54:38.033 --> 54:39.933
going to think you
just passed out

54:39.933 --> 54:41.699
on the bathroom floor.

54:41.699 --> 54:43.799
They're not even
going to notice.

54:43.799 --> 54:45.866
(laughing)

54:45.866 --> 54:48.200
Oh well.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.433
Party on.

54:49.433 --> 54:51.666
(laughing)

55:07.266 --> 55:10.266
(death metal music)

55:51.233 --> 55:52.866
- Oh, hey doctor.

55:52.866 --> 55:56.133
I think I need my
temperature taken rectally.

55:56.133 --> 55:58.899
Hopefully I don't get erectally.

55:58.899 --> 56:00.866
(laughing)

56:00.866 --> 56:02.699
- That's funny, that was good.

56:02.699 --> 56:04.133
Would you like a piece of cake?

56:04.133 --> 56:05.367
- Mm.

56:05.367 --> 56:08.033
- I like a man who
likes his cake.

56:09.567 --> 56:14.133
Take a nice big
bite of that cake.

56:14.133 --> 56:16.300
Oh yeah.

56:17.300 --> 56:18.567
- It tastes funny.

56:18.567 --> 56:19.400
- It tastes good.
- No, funny.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.400
- It's good.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.632
(laughing)

56:24.799 --> 56:27.233
(whimpering)

56:41.066 --> 56:43.000
- I hate parties
without video games.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.233
Oh well, well.

56:44.233 --> 56:45.632
What the heck are
you doing, girl?

56:45.632 --> 56:48.066
Some people can't
handle their sauce.

56:48.066 --> 56:49.833
My god, did she really pass out?

56:49.833 --> 56:50.666
Hey.

56:52.100 --> 56:54.033
What the heck, you know what?

56:54.033 --> 56:57.866
That's okay, my social
media's going to go extra.

56:57.866 --> 57:01.133
At least get three
likes on my dick.

57:01.133 --> 57:02.733
I can't wait.

57:02.733 --> 57:03.833
You know what?

57:03.833 --> 57:06.333
Put my dick on her.

57:06.333 --> 57:08.166
That'll get five likes.

57:08.166 --> 57:10.033
Yeah, put my dick on you.

57:10.033 --> 57:11.266
(laughing)

57:11.266 --> 57:13.933
Yeah, look at my dick on you.

57:13.933 --> 57:16.133
Oh man, that's great.

57:16.133 --> 57:18.666
Oh, my god.

57:18.666 --> 57:19.567
Yeah, okay.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.433
Okay, I'll hit you up later,

57:23.433 --> 57:25.599
like get some more drinks.

57:26.467 --> 57:28.866
Oh, I have to piss.

57:31.100 --> 57:34.233
- What a lovely party this is.

57:34.233 --> 57:36.333
For those of you
who don't know me.

57:36.333 --> 57:40.233
I am Dr. Fouley of
Fouley Laboratories.

57:41.400 --> 57:43.033
We have an award to
give out to one of our

57:43.033 --> 57:47.100
scientists who just
made a huge discovery.

57:49.333 --> 57:51.333
- Oh, I like it so much.

57:52.567 --> 57:55.400
- Hmm, let me go
fetch the trophy.

58:00.733 --> 58:04.899
This is a trophy that
was especially made.

58:04.899 --> 58:09.133
I would like to congratulate
our hardest working

58:09.133 --> 58:12.233
researcher, Jane Yankovich.

58:14.933 --> 58:16.933
- Are you serious right now?

58:16.933 --> 58:18.033
- Come on.

58:18.033 --> 58:19.933
_ Oh, my God.

58:19.933 --> 58:21.500
Dad, I thought you'd
know my name by now.

58:21.500 --> 58:24.233
This is so weird.

58:24.233 --> 58:26.833
Oh, my God, I didn't
think I'd win.

58:26.833 --> 58:28.200
Like, what do you do with this?

58:28.200 --> 58:29.433
Brain eating worms, you know.

58:29.433 --> 58:30.699
Oh wow.

58:30.699 --> 58:32.933
(laughing)

58:36.533 --> 58:40.200
- Oh, oh, Dr. Amy
Slogan, it's great to see

58:40.200 --> 58:42.833
you really partying for once.

58:42.833 --> 58:46.999
Do you have any words for
your colleagues at work?

58:56.699 --> 58:59.333
- No, but I have a
piece of cake for you.

58:59.333 --> 59:01.567
(laughing)

59:02.467 --> 59:04.733
(grunting)

59:09.200 --> 59:11.433
(laughing)

59:12.632 --> 59:15.200
(upbeat music)

59:17.599 --> 59:19.766
(yelling)

59:22.133 --> 59:24.400
(laughing)

59:26.166 --> 59:29.266
- Oh, oh, oh.

59:31.933 --> 59:34.699
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

59:38.233 --> 59:41.632
- You've got to stop it.

59:43.033 --> 59:43.866
Stop it.

59:44.966 --> 59:46.933
Oh, my God.

59:46.933 --> 59:48.933
You have got to stop drinking

59:48.933 --> 59:51.266
this much at parties, daddy.

59:56.833 --> 59:59.433
- These morons all need to pay.

59:59.433 --> 1:00:03.100
Be eliminated from the
gene pool completely.

1:00:05.333 --> 1:00:06.500
There you are.

1:00:08.666 --> 1:00:10.866
There's my friend.

1:00:10.866 --> 1:00:13.933
Oh, this formula
that I've created,

1:00:13.933 --> 1:00:16.599
it's going to make you bigger

1:00:16.599 --> 1:00:20.899
and more aggressive than
anyone ever thought possible.

1:00:20.899 --> 1:00:23.133
You ready to give it a try?

1:00:38.266 --> 1:00:40.533
(laughing)

1:00:45.799 --> 1:00:48.567
(sinister music)

1:01:21.100 --> 1:01:23.367
(intense music)

1:01:23.367 --> 1:01:25.632
(yelling)

1:01:25.632 --> 1:01:27.600
God, you are the
worst kind of bitch.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:28.433
You dumbass...

1:01:28.433 --> 1:01:29.600
Ow.

1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:31.567
- You, who are you calling dumb,

1:01:31.567 --> 1:01:33.400
you stupid American bitch.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:34.766
You don't know me.

1:01:34.766 --> 1:01:37.233
(grunting)

1:01:37.233 --> 1:01:38.433
- Maybe I made a mistake.

1:01:38.433 --> 1:01:41.133
Maybe after all
you do keep company

1:01:41.133 --> 1:01:44.367
with people one neuron
short of synapse.

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:46.632
(grunting)

1:01:47.799 --> 1:01:49.733
- You think you're
so smart just because

1:01:49.733 --> 1:01:51.166
you use big words.

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:53.833
That just makes you inefficient.

1:01:53.833 --> 1:01:56.100
(grunting)

1:01:57.799 --> 1:02:00.000
Bitch, won't be the last of me.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.666
(intense music)

1:02:14.799 --> 1:02:18.999
- Yeah right, talking to
Jane about me like that, huh?

1:02:18.999 --> 1:02:22.600
You think I didn't
hear all that?

1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:25.933
Do you think you can
get away with that?

1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:29.933
You think I can't hear
you and Jane talking

1:02:29.933 --> 1:02:33.699
about me like two airheads
while blowing up balloons?

1:02:33.699 --> 1:02:36.400
You two airheads even
popped two of them.

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:38.966
You're idiots in the gene pool.

1:02:43.233 --> 1:02:45.500
(laughing)

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:16.133
- Whoa, what are you doing?

1:03:16.133 --> 1:03:17.467
- Jane.

1:03:17.467 --> 1:03:19.766
I'm surprised to see
you here this morning,

1:03:19.766 --> 1:03:20.999
at the test site.

1:03:20.999 --> 1:03:23.200
That shows a surprising
amount of work ethic

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.400
on your part.

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:25.999
- I know, yeah, it
was such a crazy party

1:03:25.999 --> 1:03:27.233
last night.

1:03:27.233 --> 1:03:29.999
- So crazy that you
forgot to wear a shirt

1:03:29.999 --> 1:03:31.166
to work today?

1:03:32.133 --> 1:03:34.200
- I forgot my shirt, yes.

1:03:35.367 --> 1:03:40.300
Geez, dad, Dr. Fouley,
I could not wake him up.

1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:42.367
He must be really drunk.

1:03:42.367 --> 1:03:44.766
He got wasted at that party.

1:03:44.766 --> 1:03:46.033
- Huh.

1:03:46.033 --> 1:03:47.433
- He really has a
drinking problem.

1:03:47.433 --> 1:03:49.433
Dad needs to get
professional help.

1:03:49.433 --> 1:03:51.500
- Well, I agree
that the man needs

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:55.533
professional help, but
Jane, you know what?

1:03:55.533 --> 1:03:58.300
Since the last
time you were here

1:03:58.300 --> 1:04:00.699
at the test site,
our little amoeba

1:04:00.699 --> 1:04:03.733
have had a surprising
transformation.

1:04:03.733 --> 1:04:05.333
I thought maybe
now that you were,

1:04:05.333 --> 1:04:07.066
you know, a scientist
of the year and all,

1:04:07.066 --> 1:04:09.266
maybe you would want
to see how our little

1:04:09.266 --> 1:04:11.933
experiment has progressed.

1:04:11.933 --> 1:04:13.533
- Yeah, I'd love to see it.

1:04:13.533 --> 1:04:15.933
- All right, let's go see.

1:04:15.933 --> 1:04:16.733
Follow me.

1:04:17.899 --> 1:04:21.899
You know, I think if
you stand right here.

1:04:24.133 --> 1:04:27.966
That will give you a
perfect vantage point

1:04:27.966 --> 1:04:31.200
from which to witness
the transformation.

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:32.966
- All right.

1:04:32.966 --> 1:04:35.766
(intense music)

1:04:35.766 --> 1:04:38.100
(screaming)

1:04:48.133 --> 1:04:50.833
- I just got away from
these giant worms.

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:53.866
Monsters are real and
they are killing people.

1:04:53.866 --> 1:04:55.300
They killed Amy.

1:04:55.300 --> 1:04:58.133
- What's the deal
with this trophy?

1:04:58.133 --> 1:05:00.200
- I got it for some kind
of brain eating worms

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.999
or something like that.

1:05:01.999 --> 1:05:03.000
I don't know.

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.999
I don't want it anymore.

1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:09.367
- Okay, I'll put it to good use.

1:05:09.367 --> 1:05:11.600
And that's the whole story.

1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:14.899
- That's it?

1:05:14.899 --> 1:05:16.866
You don't even say
anything about Kim.

1:05:16.866 --> 1:05:18.632
- Well you needed to
know about the worms

1:05:18.632 --> 1:05:20.632
cause they're where
we get the serum from.

1:05:20.632 --> 1:05:22.833
It could be the
key to everything.

1:05:22.833 --> 1:05:24.567
- I'm not waiting
around another second

1:05:24.567 --> 1:05:25.933
for your bullshit.

1:05:25.933 --> 1:05:29.166
You better tell me
what happened to Kim

1:05:29.166 --> 1:05:30.899
or I'm going to--

1:05:30.899 --> 1:05:32.632
(creature growls)

1:05:32.632 --> 1:05:33.666
(gasps)
- Uh oh.

1:05:33.666 --> 1:05:34.699
One's inside.

1:05:34.699 --> 1:05:36.066
- Go check it out.

1:05:36.066 --> 1:05:38.266
And if you try to leave,

1:05:38.266 --> 1:05:40.133
I will do something really bad

1:05:40.133 --> 1:05:41.866
to your assistant.

1:05:41.866 --> 1:05:43.766
- Worse than shooting
me in the ass?

1:05:43.766 --> 1:05:44.933
- A lot worse.

1:05:46.899 --> 1:05:49.666
(dramatic music)

1:06:06.899 --> 1:06:09.367
- Damn, she left.

1:06:09.367 --> 1:06:11.799
- I guess you can't trust her.

1:06:11.799 --> 1:06:13.833
Why don't you tell me
what happened to Kim.

1:06:13.833 --> 1:06:15.666
- I don't know why
you don't believe me.

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:17.632
She left here just
like Dr. Red just did,

1:06:17.632 --> 1:06:19.866
so there's a pretty good
chance what happened

1:06:19.866 --> 1:06:23.166
to Kim is going to
happen to Dr. Red.

1:06:23.166 --> 1:06:24.533
- So you think one
of those things

1:06:24.533 --> 1:06:26.266
outside is going
to kill Dr. Red?

1:06:26.266 --> 1:06:28.733
- Yes, I do and if
you come untie me,

1:06:28.733 --> 1:06:30.600
you can help me stop the thing

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:33.600
that's in the house
from killing us.

1:06:39.100 --> 1:06:41.100
(sighs)

1:06:42.766 --> 1:06:44.367
Come on, come here.

1:06:46.866 --> 1:06:47.699
- Tell me what to do.

1:06:47.699 --> 1:06:48.799
_ It's there.

1:06:49.833 --> 1:06:53.266
- Where is it, I don't see it.

1:06:53.266 --> 1:06:56.632
(monster growls)

1:06:56.632 --> 1:06:59.133
(eerie music)

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.966
- I know that you won't hurt me.

1:07:21.966 --> 1:07:23.567
I was born to stop you
from harming the people

1:07:23.567 --> 1:07:24.933
of this planet.

1:07:24.933 --> 1:07:26.400
There's a chemical that exists

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:28.200
that causes you to
kill and I don't have

1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:30.433
that chemical inside of me.

1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:39.233
(thud)

1:07:42.433 --> 1:07:44.333
(screaming)

1:07:44.333 --> 1:07:46.733
- You're not going to
get away with this.

1:07:46.733 --> 1:07:48.699
- That's where you're wrong.

1:07:48.699 --> 1:07:50.899
But first I'm going
to do you a big favor

1:07:50.899 --> 1:07:53.766
and tell you exactly what
happened to your sister.

1:07:53.766 --> 1:07:56.333
So that concludes your
involvement in the study,

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:57.166
sort of.

1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:00.400
- Sort of?

1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:02.233
- There's also the
part about the serum

1:08:02.233 --> 1:08:04.367
coursing through your
veins that is actually

1:08:04.367 --> 1:08:05.799
a monster magnet.

1:08:07.999 --> 1:08:10.999
- What are you talking
about, monsters?

1:08:10.999 --> 1:08:12.666
- Why do you think
we had you wear

1:08:12.666 --> 1:08:15.733
a tee shirt and shorts
for our research study?

1:08:15.733 --> 1:08:17.799
- Because of the monsters.

1:08:17.799 --> 1:08:18.799
- Right.

1:08:18.799 --> 1:08:20.533
So they can eat you.

1:08:20.533 --> 1:08:22.000
You'll find out.

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.200
Later today, when you walk home,

1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:26.066
through the woods.

1:08:26.066 --> 1:08:28.266
- Yeah, I hope you
don't actually think

1:08:28.266 --> 1:08:30.699
I believe anything
you're saying.

1:08:30.699 --> 1:08:31.833
- Not now.

1:08:31.833 --> 1:08:34.467
Interestingly thought, Dr. Red,

1:08:34.467 --> 1:08:36.866
she thinks that
this serum prevents

1:08:36.866 --> 1:08:38.999
monsters from eating
people when it actually

1:08:38.999 --> 1:08:40.166
compels them to.

1:08:40.166 --> 1:08:42.766
The aliens sent the monsters.

1:08:42.766 --> 1:08:45.367
And they got the
brain eating worms

1:08:45.367 --> 1:08:47.533
to spread the death juice.

1:08:47.533 --> 1:08:50.166
The aliens must
want us all dead.

1:08:50.166 --> 1:08:52.367
- Yeah, I'd like my payment now.

1:08:52.367 --> 1:08:54.899
- Okay.

1:08:54.899 --> 1:08:56.133
Here you go.

1:08:56.133 --> 1:08:56.966
Fine.

1:09:02.233 --> 1:09:03.699
You're our first subject.

1:09:03.699 --> 1:09:05.100
I wouldn't normally
mention the monsters

1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:07.833
but I figured you'd
just think I was crazy.

1:09:07.833 --> 1:09:10.233
- Yeah, you figured right.

1:09:10.233 --> 1:09:12.933
- After the monsters
eat you, I'll take

1:09:12.933 --> 1:09:14.666
my cash back from you.

1:09:14.666 --> 1:09:16.500
You don't mind, do you?

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.100
You won't be needing it.

1:09:18.100 --> 1:09:20.166
And I have to dispose
of your remains.

1:09:20.166 --> 1:09:22.533
Dr. Red and I, we spend
all of our personal money

1:09:22.533 --> 1:09:24.699
funding this research study.

1:09:24.699 --> 1:09:27.033
As you can imagine,
none of the potential

1:09:27.033 --> 1:09:29.433
investors took us seriously.

1:09:29.433 --> 1:09:32.600
- Yeah, sure.

1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:35.600
So, it's been great.

1:09:36.733 --> 1:09:38.333
Thanks.

1:09:38.333 --> 1:09:40.733
Let me know if you
ever need me again.

1:09:40.733 --> 1:09:42.766
I could really use the cash.

1:09:42.766 --> 1:09:44.133
(laughing)

1:09:44.133 --> 1:09:45.133
- Good luck.

1:09:47.799 --> 1:09:48.699
Not really.

1:09:54.367 --> 1:09:56.367
You can figure out the rest.

1:09:56.367 --> 1:09:58.200
The monsters ate her.

1:09:58.200 --> 1:09:59.733
I went and cleaned
up her remains,

1:09:59.733 --> 1:10:01.300
which weren't much.

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:03.766
Got one of the 20's
out of the back pocket.

1:10:03.766 --> 1:10:05.500
It was pretty bloodstained.

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:08.600
But don't worry, they
accepted it at Walmart.

1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:10.033
- You're insane.

1:10:10.033 --> 1:10:11.166
(scoffs)

1:10:11.166 --> 1:10:12.300
- That's what your sister said.

1:10:12.300 --> 1:10:14.300
A lot of people way that.

1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:15.433
Guess what?

1:10:15.433 --> 1:10:17.133
I don't have a
science degree either,

1:10:17.133 --> 1:10:18.632
but Dr. Red, she needed somebody

1:10:18.632 --> 1:10:20.632
to help her with
her study, in fact,

1:10:20.632 --> 1:10:21.600
she was desperate.

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:23.066
And that's when I show up.

1:10:23.066 --> 1:10:24.567
Once I realized the
monsters existed,

1:10:24.567 --> 1:10:26.000
I knew my destiny.

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.367
- Your destiny.

1:10:27.367 --> 1:10:29.899
- The world is going to shit,

1:10:29.899 --> 1:10:30.733
and fast.

1:10:31.766 --> 1:10:34.333
Look who our President is.

1:10:34.333 --> 1:10:36.933
Look what's happening
all over the world.

1:10:36.933 --> 1:10:38.133
We need to purge.

1:10:38.133 --> 1:10:39.533
We need to start over.

1:10:39.533 --> 1:10:42.699
Maybe somebody will
get it right this time.

1:10:42.699 --> 1:10:44.567
The monsters are here.

1:10:44.567 --> 1:10:46.933
Now, I don't know if
they were brought here

1:10:46.933 --> 1:10:49.200
by aliens like Dr. Red
thinks or created in labs

1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:51.733
like Jane believes, I just know

1:10:51.733 --> 1:10:54.000
it's my job to make
it happen faster.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.600
I'm going to drop
that serum in every

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.433
water supply imaginable.

1:10:58.433 --> 1:11:01.133
And the monsters will
come from under the beds,

1:11:01.133 --> 1:11:03.066
from out of the closets.

1:11:03.066 --> 1:11:05.233
They're going to multiply.

1:11:05.233 --> 1:11:07.233
And they're going to kill.

1:11:07.233 --> 1:11:09.433
(grunting)

1:11:09.433 --> 1:11:10.567
- You don't know the first thing

1:11:10.567 --> 1:11:12.033
about tying someone up.

1:11:12.033 --> 1:11:13.367
- Oh, what did you do?

1:11:13.367 --> 1:11:14.567
You can't stop it
from happening.

1:11:14.567 --> 1:11:17.233
(intense music)

1:11:19.899 --> 1:11:22.666
- I may not be able to
stop it from happening,

1:11:22.666 --> 1:11:24.899
but I can make sure that
you're the first person

1:11:24.899 --> 1:11:25.999
to go to hell.

1:11:25.999 --> 1:11:26.833
(grunts)

1:11:26.833 --> 1:11:27.666
- No!

1:11:35.066 --> 1:11:37.233
(gasping)

1:11:42.467 --> 1:11:44.632
(yelling)

1:11:47.567 --> 1:11:50.433
(explosion)

1:11:50.433 --> 1:11:52.933
(eerie music)

1:12:21.966 --> 1:12:24.200
- Oh really, you want
the police department

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:26.200
all in here looking
at everything?

1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:28.433
- I don't know, do you?

1:12:28.433 --> 1:12:31.100
(intense music)

1:12:35.166 --> 1:12:36.666
- I don't remember my line.

1:12:36.666 --> 1:12:37.632
(laughing)

1:12:37.632 --> 1:12:39.300
- Hit me in the eye.

1:12:40.500 --> 1:12:42.999
(eerie music)

1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:54.266
- Oh, this is like
the ugliest thing

1:13:54.266 --> 1:13:56.233
I've seen in my life.

1:13:56.233 --> 1:13:58.333
It's gross, they're gross.

1:13:58.333 --> 1:14:00.367
If we're going to
tongue, the atmosphere

1:14:00.367 --> 1:14:01.367
is just gross.

1:14:01.367 --> 1:14:02.999
- You don't like
the decorations?

1:14:02.999 --> 1:14:04.300
- No, I hate them.

1:14:04.300 --> 1:14:05.966
- Brenda, you're such a diva.

1:14:05.966 --> 1:14:10.200
- Thank you, I'm going
to go get ready, thanks.

1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:12.699
(eerie music)

1:15:15.866 --> 1:15:17.367
- I want you to tell me about

1:15:17.367 --> 1:15:19.866
your experience with monsters.

1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:24.966
- When I was a little kid,

1:15:24.966 --> 1:15:26.500
I was a monster.

1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:28.066
But I grew out of it.

1:15:28.066 --> 1:15:30.632
- When I was a
kid, my grandfather

1:15:30.632 --> 1:15:32.367
was eaten by a monster.

1:15:32.367 --> 1:15:34.933
It came out of a box
and bit him in the face.

1:15:34.933 --> 1:15:37.666
At least, that's
what my mom tells me.

1:15:37.666 --> 1:15:40.166
(eerie music)

1:15:42.266 --> 1:15:45.133
- My many years as a
crime scene photographer,

1:15:45.133 --> 1:15:47.066
I've seen bodies
that have been torn,

1:15:47.066 --> 1:15:50.766
bitten, ripped,
sliced, bloody chunks,

1:15:50.766 --> 1:15:54.500
and nothing I've seen
has ever compared

1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:57.999
to what a monster can
do to a human being.

1:15:59.567 --> 1:16:01.500
- Okay, I usually
don't like to talk

1:16:01.500 --> 1:16:04.833
about it cause people
don't believe me but,

1:16:04.833 --> 1:16:09.066
when I was a kid, I lived
in a coal mining town.

1:16:09.066 --> 1:16:12.033
Really far away, in
the middle of nowhere.

1:16:12.033 --> 1:16:14.533
And there was this
guy, he wore a hat.

1:16:14.533 --> 1:16:17.333
You think, no big
deal, he wore a hat.

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:19.467
But nobody else is
allowed to wear a hat

1:16:19.467 --> 1:16:22.733
because if you wore
a hat, this monster

1:16:22.733 --> 1:16:25.333
would come and get
you, like squiggly

1:16:25.333 --> 1:16:28.733
little worm like,
but he had teeth that

1:16:28.733 --> 1:16:31.433
chomp you to pieces.

1:16:34.966 --> 1:16:37.866
- I was there at that
coal miner town, too,

1:16:37.866 --> 1:16:39.467
just like Dave was.

1:16:39.467 --> 1:16:42.866
And I don't believe that
there was any monsters

1:16:42.866 --> 1:16:43.866
there at all.

1:16:43.866 --> 1:16:45.733
I don't believe in monsters.

1:16:45.733 --> 1:16:46.999
Well, except for Bigfoot.

1:16:46.999 --> 1:16:50.300
I think Bigfoot's the real deal.

1:16:50.300 --> 1:16:52.966
(intense music)
