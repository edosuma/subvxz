there was a way for me to transfer it

00:17.160 --> 00:18.286
I'll do the transfer spell.

This is all very normal.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.329
- Are those--
- Cop-approved.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.205
(PANTING)

39:54.000 --> 39:55.001
Mmm.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.364
You asked me what I missed the most
about being human?

40:00.640 --> 40:05.851
The ecstasy of eating
this incredibly crappy donut.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.649
- So all's forgiven?
-(GRUNTS)

40:15.320 --> 40:16.731
Not by a long shot.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.161
(STEFAN GROANS)

40:24.640 --> 40:25.687
(GASPS)

40:26.280 --> 40:27.327
What is this?

40:27.520 --> 40:30.046
About that,
I'm afraid Marty's not gonna make it.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.524
-(GASPS)
- Buckle up.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.929
We have less than 48 hours
to track down your real body.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.051
Wait, are you still tracking
Stefan's body?

40:41.240 --> 40:44.403
Whoever's in him just stopped in Memphis.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.051
I can hear music.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.685
It's a fraternity house.

40:51.360 --> 40:55.331
Wait, a vampire just beelined to Memphis
and went straight to a university?

40:55.520 --> 40:56.760
Okay, we've got to go.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.009
Why? What's going on?

40:59.200 --> 41:01.965
It's something that Rayna said.
It reminded me of an old wives' tale

41:02.160 --> 41:04.891
about a string of murders that happened
in Memphis in the 1880s.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.244
RIC: Apparently, he was a serial killer
before he became a vampire.

41:08.480 --> 41:12.565
He would stalk sororities
and fraternities, and murder for sport.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.330
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
- Libations?

41:14.520 --> 41:15.851
(CHUCKLES) Nice.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.121
Come on in, man.

41:17.320 --> 41:18.321
(INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)

41:20.840 --> 41:23.571
STUDENTS: (CHANTING)
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

41:25.200 --> 41:27.407
RIC: As the story goes,
he wouldn't just kill.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.170
He would force his victims
to murder each other.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.721
(LAUGHING)

41:33.640 --> 41:35.608
And they would tell the story,

41:35.840 --> 41:37.410
but no one would believe them.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.761
Eventually, the burden
would drive them mad.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.005
They never caught the killer.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.924
