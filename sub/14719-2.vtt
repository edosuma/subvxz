11:57.400 --> 11:58.920
I want a job.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.200
What's that got
to do with the tree?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.720
Because I am sick
of being the one

12:01.840 --> 12:03.320
that has to deal
with all this shit.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.560
By "all this shit," doyou mean raising our son?

12:05.680 --> 12:08.320
He's old enough to
look after himself.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.840
I need something to do, Ted.

12:10.960 --> 12:16.200
Give me something else to do,so I won't get into fights.

12:16.320 --> 12:20.880
[heavy breathing]

12:21.000 --> 12:24.160
Well, we could always
have that second kid

12:24.280 --> 12:26.960
we've been talking about.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.920
[music playing]

12:59.080 --> 13:00.720
Ted.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.840
You're back.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.480
Back from where?

13:03.600 --> 13:04.840
You tell me.

13:04.960 --> 13:05.720
Nope.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.440
Not a clue.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.080
I haven't seen
you for a while.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.960
Jeez, you must be prettybloody useless at looking

13:11.080 --> 13:12.480
because I've been right here.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.720
Well, here or work.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.640
Work didn't happen to take youto Tokoroa or Tauranga, did it?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.560
I don't like Tokoroa.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.080
It smells funny.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.480
What about Hamilton?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.040
Word comes down the
line there's some

13:24.160 --> 13:27.000
elegantly-crafted robberies.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.600
I think to myself, I haven'tseen Ted West lately.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.000
Wish I could help
you, Mr. McArthy.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.440
I really do.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.120
You wouldn't be
helping me, Ted.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.360
You'd be helping yourself downthe straight and narrow path.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.280
Whatever path it is, it didn'ttake me to any of those towns

13:42.400 --> 13:43.880
you're talking about.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.200
RITA: And I can testify to that.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.800
Sure you can, Rita.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.960
Been real
stay-at-home, we have--

13:50.080 --> 13:52.280
watching the election
hoo-ha on the telly.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.040
Is that so?

13:54.160 --> 13:55.680
Which side of the
fence you on, Ted?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.680
Oh, my blood runs red.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.480
Citizen Verolling, that's me.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.680
I like Muldoon.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.000
Won't deny it.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.920
Tell you, Mike, our
political differences--

14:04.040 --> 14:05.240
some nights it's a
wonder the neighbors

14:05.360 --> 14:06.680
don't call the police.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.040
Fair enough.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.400
Me, I got a lot of
time for Bruce Beetham.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.840
[laughing]

14:15.960 --> 14:17.400
Good to see you back, Ted.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.560
Never went anywhere, Mike.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.880
[car engine starts]

14:28.000 --> 14:29.360
Shooting through, pet?

14:29.480 --> 14:31.320
Yes, Ted, I am.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.800
A pity.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.200
Nice of you to look
after Rita, though.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.120
Ah, it's my pleasure.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.760
What did he want?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.080
Probably best you don'twear that broach for a while.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.560
I think I can manage that.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.040
[car starts]

14:48.160 --> 14:49.320
All right, boy.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.960
Let's go see these people.- Forget them.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.320
No, no.

14:52.440 --> 14:53.560
He needs to put
right what he's done.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.360
ROD: [sighs]

15:03.480 --> 15:04.280
How much?

15:11.040 --> 15:11.880
Miss Ngaire.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.800
Hm.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.640
Oy, Rod.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.880
How much?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.960
Look, these are
tough times, Lefty.

15:22.080 --> 15:22.920
How much?

15:25.720 --> 15:28.800
[slurping]

15:28.920 --> 15:31.880
I now get the importanceof this tree to you fellas,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.840
and I hope that we
can work together

15:33.960 --> 15:37.040
to do what must be done.

15:37.160 --> 15:41.560
Like, maybe plant another one.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.120
To celebrate, you know, the--

15:44.240 --> 15:45.080
neighborhood.

15:48.040 --> 15:52.040
That would be honorable thing.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.640
Well, then, welcome
to our street.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.640
We should drink on this.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.920
A little.

16:00.040 --> 16:00.960
[kissing ]

16:01.080 --> 16:02.360
I'm Darijo.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.000
You like wine, Ted?

16:04.120 --> 16:06.760
Uh, I'm more of a beer man.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.800
Here we drink wine.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.440
Did you know that they'vebeen here for years,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.160
and they practically
built Marsden Point.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.480
And they're really good people.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.880
If you gave 'em a
chance, you'd love them.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.040
And it's all sorted.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.280
It's all good, so don't
worry your pretty head.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.440
LEFTY: Knock, knock.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.360
TED: Lefty!

16:29.480 --> 16:30.800
Come have some wine.

16:30.920 --> 16:31.800
OK.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
Someone's having a good night.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.520
All right, me and Ngaireare off to the Hungry Horse.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.280
But, uh, let me add to the joy.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.480
Your wages from the
leftover jewels.

16:43.120 --> 16:43.920
Is this it?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.480
Yeah, I know.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.280
Bloody rotten agent.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.600
But what can we do?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.320
He's our man, so we
take what we can get.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.080
Love to stay and chat butthere's a carpetbagger

16:52.200 --> 16:53.000
with my name on it.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.760
Ah, well.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.280
You get what you can
take in this life.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.440
Take from Rod was a bit light.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.200
Carol was not impressed.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.960
Luckily, I have a job.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.520
I thought the whole
idea of the road trip

17:19.640 --> 17:21.040
was we lay low for a while.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.640
Then I found us a job.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.080
Good job?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.000
Martha.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.120
[music playing]

17:28.240 --> 17:30.960
I thought Martha was thejob that could never be.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.160
It was.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.000
Now it isn't.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.480
If your intel from
that miner's correct,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.920
the money's there the sametime every month, right?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.200
It's insane.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.720
All that money in the
safe, and the shit

17:42.840 --> 17:44.640
just sitting there
'til they pay us.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.040
Oh, it is.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.280
Correct, that is.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.760
Then the money's
just sitting--

17:48.880 --> 17:49.640
waiting.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.200
But they have security.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.320
And the Kraut safe-- it'sthe only safe in the world

17:53.440 --> 17:54.600
that you can't crack.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.360
The Schotzinger 609.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.680
And not "can't crack", just--

17:58.800 --> 18:01.880
I need more time to crackit than the location allows.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.640
So what's changed?

18:03.760 --> 18:05.320
I met someone who can
change the location.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.320
Shift the entire mine?

18:06.440 --> 18:07.560
[laughs]

18:07.680 --> 18:09.040
Just the bits of
it we want shifted.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.760
And how did you
meet this person?

18:10.880 --> 18:12.680
Over a bottle
or three of wine.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.320
I know what you are, Ted.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.200
Do you, Darijo?

18:16.320 --> 18:19.000
You are criminal genius.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.440
You mistake me
for someone else.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.320
No, no.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.680
I keep my ear to ground.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.160
You and I-- we are
in the same business.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.120
Are we?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.000
One day, I hope.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.760
For now, I work for my family.- Doing what?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.080
Heavy machinery.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.240
Moving things.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.960
I'm the best.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.240
Then why be a criminal?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.720
The women.

18:40.840 --> 18:47.200
[laughing]

18:47.320 --> 18:48.400
Sorry.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.320
Sorry.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.600
Sick as a dog.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.280
You had the carpetbag
steak and drink

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
too many Harvey Wallbangers.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.320
My shrimp cocktail was bad.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.920
Then we got home to
find we'd been burgled.

18:58.040 --> 18:58.800
Wait, what?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.200
No.
- Mm.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.760
I know.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.120
While we were out bastardraided Ngaire's jewelry box.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.280
[laughs]

19:05.400 --> 19:06.720
Not that box, Bilk.

19:06.840 --> 19:07.920
Well, that's not right.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.440
Tell me about it.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.520
Probably bloody Maoris.

19:11.640 --> 19:12.440
Mom?

19:12.560 --> 19:13.320
Yes, love?

19:13.440 --> 19:16.320
Got you a present.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.320
Did you?

19:17.440 --> 19:18.280
Because of the tree.

19:22.800 --> 19:27.080
[music playing]

19:31.640 --> 19:33.760
You said you liked itbetter than what Dad got you.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.360
So I went and got it.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.240
Right.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.800
The thing is, love--

19:43.920 --> 19:47.480
while this is a lovelythought, I can't wear this--

19:47.600 --> 19:51.440
ever-- because they know
we know who stole it.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.840
I was just trying
to do what you said.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.400
What was that?

19:55.520 --> 19:58.160
Do crimes that weren't stupid.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.920
And I thought you'd like it.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.960
I do, sweetheart.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.920
[kissing ] Mm.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.760
I really, really do.

on their way to you now.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.560
RITA [ON PHONE]: I needyou to listen and say yes.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.560
I'm putting
something in play here

20:39.680 --> 20:41.080
and Ted can't know about it.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.720
Rita, you minx.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.960
But when I give you the nod, Ineed to know you'll back me up.

I'm all ears, darling.

Sweetie, wake up.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.840
I need you to get up.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.720
I need you to get dressed.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.640
Is it the police?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.520
No, honey.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.840
Not tonight.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.520
Tonight, I need you to
do something for me.

21:43.120 --> 21:47.520
[window rattles]

21:47.640 --> 21:49.000
Made it.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.000
Go, go.

21:50.120 --> 21:50.920
Do the thing.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.600
The money's in the shed.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.920
Will be tomorrow night, afterthey bring it from the bank.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.000
Why so much money
in a shitty shed?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.320
Because this is
where the miners come

22:02.440 --> 22:04.600
to get their pay and drink.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.640
It's a stupid idea.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.560
They think that the
money's safe in the safe

22:09.680 --> 22:10.760
for a few hours.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.800
That's all we need to know.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.640
Question is, can you
do what I need you to?

22:15.760 --> 22:16.880
Sure, no problem.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.480
Piece of piss.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.400
No technical issues?

22:22.240 --> 22:25.160
Long as you take
care of guard--

nothing technical.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.680
Yeah, they'll be sorted.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.600
Good.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.320
I thought we were
going shopping.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.440
Rita's right.

really good stuff.

Carol knows herjewels, and Rod does not.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.320
So nice of you to say.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.760
We just want to help youreplace the things you lost.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.440
Hello, my three
favorite ladies.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.520
Really, not now, Rod.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.040
- As you wish.
- What about this one?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.320
No, I don't think so.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.960
Ngaire, isn't this one yours?

22:56.080 --> 22:58.440
What?

22:58.560 --> 22:59.360
Oh, my god.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.280
It is.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.520

If he's bottled on us--

24:38.600 --> 24:40.080
He'll be here.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.600
If he was here, we'd hearhim, and I don't hear anything.

We can walk from here.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.720
What about my money?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.280
I'll explain as we walk.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.040
What about you pay me
my fucking share now?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.520
Lefty looks after
the money now.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.440
Him?

27:30.560 --> 27:31.440
But he's a cocksucker.

you talk to no one.

more you're protected,

27:55.320 --> 27:56.120
the more they're protected.

Do you get that?

27:57.120 --> 27:57.920
Yes, yes, yes.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.520
But what about my money?

27:59.640 --> 28:01.080
I want to buy a car.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.880
In my gang, one of Lefty'sjobs is hiding the money.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.920
But he will steal our money.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.480
His eyes are too close together.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.560
I know exactly how
much money he has,

28:08.680 --> 28:10.320
and exactly how
much he'll dish out.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.200
Dish out.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.640
What does this mean?

28:12.760 --> 28:14.520
It means-- he pays
us, like a wage.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.400
What?

28:15.520 --> 28:16.880
What bullshit is this?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.240
It means no one walks intoa car yard waving around

28:19.360 --> 28:21.320

28:21.440 --> 28:22.600

You have a traitor
in your midst.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.760
What?

29:12.880 --> 29:14.320
No, not here--

29:14.440 --> 29:16.440
in your circle of acquaintances.

29:16.560 --> 29:20.640
[exhales] You mean Darijo?

29:20.760 --> 29:21.880
But I put him straight.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.120
Who the hell is Darijo?

29:23.240 --> 29:24.040
Dallie.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.080
Pitched in last night.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.160
You let one of those
Doslic scum in on a job?

29:29.280 --> 29:32.760
And it went well, andit's none of your business.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.240
So, who's the traitor?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.200
Rod Nugent.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.760
He's stolen from us.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.360
So?

29:38.480 --> 29:39.800
Bastard steals from us everytime we do a deal with him.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.800
No, actually stolen.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.880
He comes around to do thedeal on the Hamilton job.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.960
I catch him staring
at Ngaire's tits--

29:46.080 --> 29:47.720
which is out of order,
but understandable

29:47.840 --> 29:50.080
because they're great tits.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.440
But she's wearing the
necklace I gave ya.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.280
The one that then got
stolen from our house.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.680
And turned up in his shop.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.280
He wasn't fencing
it for someone?

29:58.400 --> 30:00.280
Claimed he had no
idea how it got there.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.600
He'd never seen it before.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.960
Which is correct
because I saw how he

30:03.080 --> 30:05.200
was looking at Ngaire's tits.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.440
I didn't tell you this before,Ted, but while you were inside,

30:08.560 --> 30:12.120
he tried to take
advantage of me.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.120
Sexually, Ted.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.320
Yes, yes, I got that.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.160
I just-- I can't
see Rod as a thief.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.400
I mean, getting off his fat ass.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.080
What's way more
likely he was actually

30:21.200 --> 30:22.800
looking at Ngaire's tits and hedidn't even notice the necklace

30:22.920 --> 30:24.120
dangling in front of them.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.840
Can we please stop
talking about my bosoms?

30:25.960 --> 30:29.440
[laughs] Sorry.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.320
"Bosoms" is a funny word.

30:31.440 --> 30:35.720
Necklace or not, Ted, Rod hasbeen ripping us off for ages.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.400
Maybe it's time for someone new.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.560
Well, like who?

30:38.680 --> 30:40.280
He's the only
bloody game in town.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.880
Unless we set up a new game--

30:43.000 --> 30:44.480
someone we can trust.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.880
Someone who knows
the price of things,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.600
and how to sell themwithout drawing attention.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.800
You obviously have someonein mind, Bilkey, so who is he?

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
Spit him out.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.840
Actually, I was
thinking of Rita.

30:54.960 --> 30:55.800
Me?

30:55.920 --> 30:56.720
Yes, you.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.240
I suppose I fit the bill.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.280
And it would give me somethingproductive to do with my day.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.880
No.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.800
No wife of mine spends herdays flogging off dodgy goods.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.560
We're better than that.

31:10.680 --> 31:15.000
But, we are going
down to that store

31:15.120 --> 31:16.280
to have a bloody word to Rod.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.680
I don't think
that's a good idea.

31:17.800 --> 31:18.680
Why not?

31:18.800 --> 31:20.480
It's not open yet.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.760
He won't be there.
- Fair point.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.680
Later then.

31:23.800 --> 31:28.480
[mower engine rumbling]

31:31.480 --> 31:33.200
Ah, you didn't have to that.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.480
You deserve it.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.960
You had a busy night last night.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.040
And a profitable one.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.480
Keep us right for a while.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.040
I've been thinking
about Bilkey's idea.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.480
It has a lot of merit.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.880
And it was Bilkey's
idea, was it?

31:49.000 --> 31:49.760
No.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.160
OK, it was my idea.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.080
But Bilkey agrees.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.320
It's a great idea.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.760
It's not going
to happen, love.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.080
Then can I remind youthat in your line of work,

31:57.200 --> 32:00.160
an idiot like Rod Nugent getsyou sent away if Mike McArthy

your bloody problem is.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.840
Who would you rather dealwith, Rod Nugent or me?

32:11.960 --> 32:13.360
It's not that simple.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.280
Who can you trust
more, him or me?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
It's not your world, Rita.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.840
Excuse me?

32:19.960 --> 32:22.960
Every time you do a job,
every bloody road trip,

32:23.080 --> 32:25.960
every night that you're nothere, I am up to my neck

32:26.080 --> 32:27.000
in your world.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.600
It's different.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.720
Because that's what beingthe wife of the great Ted West

32:30.840 --> 32:31.640
means?

32:31.760 --> 32:32.840
Yes, actually.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.800
I do what I do so
you don't have to.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.520
That makes no sense.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.000
It's not your world, Rita.

32:38.120 --> 32:38.880
Why?

32:39.000 --> 32:39.920
Because I'm a woman?

we'd meet up later.

Yes, yes, but--

now I need you to come with me.

This is about what
you did to my brother.

When was this?

What, exactly, is
the problem here?

we are not criminals.

regarded as straight-up kiwis.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.440
Yup, I get that.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.680
So you must never involveDarijo in any of your crimes

34:26.800 --> 34:29.360
ever again.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.880
Deal.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.840
I'm more than happy with that.

34:32.960 --> 34:38.080
And you must give us allthe money from this crime.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.440
Sorry?

34:39.560 --> 34:42.120
As reparations for the shame.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.760
The shame Darijo brought.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.040
So, you can have his share.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.400
No.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.320
All of it.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.240
Ah.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.960
No.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.240
No?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.440
I'm not going to
give you all the money.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.400
I don't have it, for starters.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.640
Your friend with one testiclehas, and you're his boss, no?

35:03.760 --> 35:07.000
So he will bring the
money when you tell him.

35:07.120 --> 35:10.520
Call the man with one ball.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.440
[phone rings]

35:14.560 --> 35:16.000
- Hello?
- Hey, Ngaire.

35:16.120 --> 35:16.920
Is Lefty in?

35:17.040 --> 35:17.840
Hang on.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.200
It's Ted.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.200
Is it important?

35:25.320 --> 35:27.200
Is it important?

35:27.320 --> 35:29.680
Yes.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.080
He says yes.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.320
[sighs] Hold the phone for me.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.400
I thought we were gonna see Rod.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.360
I mean, you never called,so I'm having a sauna.

35:39.480 --> 35:40.800
What is it?

35:40.920 --> 35:43.520
There's a problem withthe money Martha gave us.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.560
What problem?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.720
With a third party
laying claim to it.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.360
Eh?

35:49.480 --> 35:51.480
What third party?

35:51.600 --> 35:54.240
[ON PHONE] Just bring themoney where he tells you, OK?

35:58.520 --> 36:00.880
Who was that?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.160
It was Dafna.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.520
Are you-- you with
the bloody Dallies?

36:06.640 --> 36:09.360
I told you bringing those madbastards in was a mistake.

36:09.480 --> 36:10.920
We can discuss that later.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.920
Oh, I have to
talk to the others.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.560
What?
Why?

36:14.680 --> 36:16.520
LEFTY [ON PHONE]: You're theone you always bangs on about we

36:16.640 --> 36:18.560
all need to be involved
in big decisions.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.680
And this is a big decision.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.920
Call me back in an hour.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.320
Hang up.
- What?

36:24.440 --> 36:25.200
Hang up.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.160
What was that all about?

36:30.280 --> 36:31.640
Ted's being
kidnapped by Dallies.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.640
You should definitely beleading this gang, Lefty.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.960
That would never happen
if you were in charge.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.400
[music playing]

36:43.520 --> 36:44.840
I thought you said
he was the boss.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.440
- Well, I thought he was.- I am the boss.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.160
Then how come no
one does as you say?

36:48.280 --> 36:51.680
Oh, well pardon me for notbeing General bloody Tito.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.640
Don't you dare say that name.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.480
Tito, Tito, Tito.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.880
Your friends, or whatever theyare, will bring us the money.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.120
We'll wait.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.680
You're not going anywhere.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.800
At least call my wife and tellher I might be late for dinner.

37:17.920 --> 37:21.800
[phone ringing]

37:21.920 --> 37:22.720
Hello?

37:22.840 --> 37:24.040
Hi, love.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.280
Where are you?

37:26.400 --> 37:28.880
I'm not really
at liberty to say.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.240
So, what I saw was what I saw?

37:31.360 --> 37:33.840
TED [ON PHONE]: What
did you think you saw?

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
Looked like a
kidnapping to me.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.160
I guess you could say that.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.080
Is she there?

37:38.200 --> 37:39.120
Who?

37:39.240 --> 37:40.040
The cow.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.440
[SLOWLY] Yes.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.440
Put her on.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.440
Is that wise?

37:47.560 --> 37:48.320
Put her on.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.880
Rita wants to talk to you.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.400
Yes.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.280
You have my husband, so Ihave your daughter, Maria.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.960
I get him back, youget you little slut back.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.120
And then you stay out
of our lives forever.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.880
Do you understand?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
You're lying.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.000
Call me when you
realize I'm not.

[knocking]

38:17.560 --> 38:19.920
I thought you kids mightlike some ginger nuts.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.080
Thank you Mrs. West,and for inviting me over.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.760
But I should probably
be getting home soon.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.200
I've just spoken
to your mother,

38:25.320 --> 38:27.480
and she said you can stayfor as long as you like.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.800
In fact, she insisted on it.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.600
So you kids have fun.

Your wife has started awar between our two families.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.760
It could be argued that youwere the ones who started it.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.920
But she was the one
who took it too far.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.000
But we will go further.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.760
Much further than
what you can imagine.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.840
No!

39:04.960 --> 39:07.360
No, we won't.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.000
This has gone as
far as it will go.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.040
Don't you tell me what to do.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.400
This is all because of you!

39:13.520 --> 39:14.680
Yes!

one who ends it.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.880
OK, that's quite
enough of that.

Hey, Ted.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.120
Just between you and me--

40:20.240 --> 40:21.880
maybe we do another
job some day?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.720
To soothe the pain.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.720
Eh.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.840
Doesn't hurt, to be honest.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.400
The pain of admitting
that you're wrong.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.160
I'm not some kind
of house frau, Ted.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.800
I need to get out and do things.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.680
To have an actual job to stopme going crazy around here.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.240
But does it have
to be this job?

40:51.360 --> 40:54.120
Think about, Ted.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.800
You can trust me.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.560
I know all your
connections because I've

40:57.680 --> 41:00.560
made scones for most of them.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.920
And you want to
know the best thing?

41:04.040 --> 41:05.520
What?

41:05.640 --> 41:09.560
Put a woman in that store,doing what Rod Nugent does,

41:09.680 --> 41:12.400
and no one will suspect
it because women

41:12.520 --> 41:16.280
never do that kind of thing.

41:16.400 --> 41:20.720
[sighs]

41:20.840 --> 41:21.960
Actually, that's
not the best thing.

41:25.200 --> 41:29.240
The best thing is
that I can have a job,

41:29.360 --> 41:33.520
and still do all the
things that a wife does.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.200
All of them.

41:36.320 --> 41:43.080

out of the way, first.

thing I'll change.

Look, if this is about thenecklace misunderstanding--

Open it.

the most electorates,
