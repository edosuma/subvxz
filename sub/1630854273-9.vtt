WEBVTT

00:01.818 --> 00:03.151
-You guys ready? Let's go!
-Yeah!

00:03.245 --> 00:04.486
Narrator:
...On beyond oak island...

00:04.580 --> 00:06.063
Deal:
General cornwallis

00:06.156 --> 00:08.156
Waged total war
against the colonists.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.175
Howell:
Cornwallis and his pillaging

00:10.327 --> 00:13.737
And plundering would have been
accumulating wealth.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.922
Matty:
Matt howell
believes he knows where

00:16.075 --> 00:17.516
Cornwallis's treasure is.

00:17.743 --> 00:19.076
Great day, everybody.
Let's treasure hunt.

00:19.169 --> 00:20.519
Howell:
Yeah, let's go. Let's get wet.

00:20.746 --> 00:21.854
Matty:
Divers in.

00:25.584 --> 00:28.085
-You ready?
-I don't think I am.

00:28.103 --> 00:29.987
-(gasps)
-no way!

00:32.182 --> 00:33.866
All the while
we were growing up,

00:34.017 --> 00:37.036
My brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.038
Rick:
Pirate treasure,

00:39.189 --> 00:40.781
Cursed treasure.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.708
Civil war gold.

00:42.859 --> 00:45.544
-(laughter)
-since then,
our work on oak island

00:45.771 --> 00:47.938
Has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:48.031 --> 00:50.865
-Whoa.
-...Waiting to be explored.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.777
Rick:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:53.796 --> 00:56.129
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.390
-Marty: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

00:58.617 --> 01:00.726
-...And share our insights.
-"ill-gotten gains."

01:00.953 --> 01:02.227
-Rick: And who knows...
-Gary: I got it.

01:02.454 --> 01:04.045
...Maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.639
Marty:
Not only in america.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.549
Wow. That is gold.

01:07.643 --> 01:09.309
-Rick: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:09.403 --> 01:11.070
Marty:
<i> Beyond oak island.</i>

01:19.896 --> 01:21.638
Matty: Something
that's come up before

01:21.731 --> 01:24.308
In our conversations
has been this

01:24.326 --> 01:27.811
Connection between war
and treasure.

01:27.904 --> 01:29.646
You know,
where there's been war,

01:29.665 --> 01:30.497
-Where there's been upheaval...
-Upheaval, yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:30.649 --> 01:32.257
...As you often say,

01:32.484 --> 01:34.742
There is treasure
associated to it.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.596
Yeah. From the sacking
of rome to havana to

01:37.823 --> 01:40.748
All kinds of nationalistic
warfare, if you will.

01:42.161 --> 01:44.603
And treasure's associated
with almost every one of them.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.255
It's not like we haven't had
significant upheaval

01:47.274 --> 01:48.423
Here in north america.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.442
We looked into civil war
connection

01:50.669 --> 01:52.519
With poverty island,

01:52.613 --> 01:55.355
The mexican revolution, pancho
villa-- we looked into that.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.190
And even oak island,
like, that connection,

01:57.284 --> 01:58.692
And-and how someone
like george washington

01:58.844 --> 02:00.786
And people like that

02:01.013 --> 02:02.362
You wouldn't normally associate
with the oak island treasure

02:02.514 --> 02:04.105
Until you start finding
some things out, right?

02:04.125 --> 02:05.866
And then you go
"well, wait a second here.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.352
That could've funded the
american revolution in part."

02:08.445 --> 02:10.111
-Yup.
-Uh, absolutely plausible.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.706
Are you guys aware
of any other

02:12.858 --> 02:17.027
Revolutionary war
treasure mystery specifically?

02:17.045 --> 02:18.786
It kind of flies
under the radar.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.714
You don't associate
the revolutionary war

02:20.808 --> 02:22.699
Per se with treasure.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.718
-Well...
-Rick: Well, you obviously...

02:24.812 --> 02:28.372
Yeah. What... What's with
the canary look over there?

02:28.390 --> 02:30.816
I may have put
my finger on one. Uh,

02:31.043 --> 02:34.544
I'm specifically talking
about general cornwallis

02:34.638 --> 02:37.564
-And his defeat at yorktown.
-Okay.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.309
He may have buried treasure,
secreted away treasure,

02:41.403 --> 02:44.246
Uh, right before
he was defeated finally.

02:46.742 --> 02:51.319
Narrator:
In 1781, after six
exhausting and violent years,

02:51.413 --> 02:53.413
The tide
of the revolutionary war

02:53.565 --> 02:57.067
Was beginning to turn in favor
of the american colonial army,

02:57.085 --> 02:59.845
Thanks to the leadership
of general george washington

02:59.996 --> 03:01.847
And the support of France.

03:02.074 --> 03:05.258
Having lost many of
their strongholds in the north,

03:05.411 --> 03:07.077
The british crown ordered

03:07.170 --> 03:09.170
The esteemed
general charles cornwallis

03:09.264 --> 03:12.416
And some 9,000 soldiers
to take control of the south

03:12.434 --> 03:15.101
By establishing
a new fortification

03:15.196 --> 03:17.529
In yorktown, virginia.

03:17.756 --> 03:21.349
Deal:
General cornwallis was
a career soldier

03:21.443 --> 03:24.261
Working his way up
through the ranks,

03:24.279 --> 03:27.280
And he began to actually
ask for the command

03:27.374 --> 03:30.267
To come to the colonies.

03:30.360 --> 03:34.604
He waged total war
against all the colonists here.

03:34.698 --> 03:36.698
Narrator:
In order to crush the morale

03:36.792 --> 03:38.700
Of the citizens in virginia,

03:38.719 --> 03:42.221
Cornwallis pillaged the nearby
towns along the york river,

03:42.448 --> 03:45.390
Plundering valuables, and
according to some researchers,

03:45.617 --> 03:49.061
Burying caches of the spoils
along the banks of the river

03:49.212 --> 03:52.731
For later retrieval
once the fort was established.

03:52.882 --> 03:55.717
There was a lot
of looting and raiding

03:55.811 --> 03:58.295
And destroying
of personal property.

03:58.388 --> 04:01.147
Destroying farms,
crops, livestock,

04:01.242 --> 04:03.300
Even murdering people

04:03.318 --> 04:05.744
Who they thought were supporting
the continental troops.

04:05.971 --> 04:11.641
If you can eliminate
the support of the citizens,

04:11.735 --> 04:13.643
Then you're going
to help your cause.

04:13.662 --> 04:16.646
Narrator:
Unfortunately
for general cornwallis,

04:16.740 --> 04:19.574
His brutality failed
to pay dividends.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.243
In September of 1781,

04:22.337 --> 04:24.412
He and his soldiers
found themselves

04:24.431 --> 04:27.099
Hopelessly overwhelmed
by washington's army

04:27.250 --> 04:29.993
And their french allies
at the battle of yorktown.

04:30.086 --> 04:33.438
Deal:
Cornwallis went to yorktown

04:33.590 --> 04:37.609
Thinking he was going
to be meeting british ships

04:37.836 --> 04:41.855
With supplies and going to
beef up the army and so forth,

04:41.949 --> 04:46.118
And he didn't realize
that the french navy was there,

04:46.269 --> 04:48.862
And that they had defeated
the british.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.956
And he became trapped.

04:51.183 --> 04:55.943
Trapped by the french navy
on the water, and on the land,

04:55.963 --> 04:57.521
By the french army,
as well as

04:57.539 --> 04:59.464
The continental troops
under washington.

04:59.616 --> 05:03.969
Being trapped, cornwallis was,
eventually, in October of 1781,

05:04.196 --> 05:07.547
Forced to surrender
his army there at yorktown.

05:07.699 --> 05:11.793
Narrator:
Although documented
searches have been taking place

05:11.812 --> 05:14.980
In and around yorktown
for more than a century,

05:15.131 --> 05:16.964
The believed buried caches

05:16.984 --> 05:19.318
Of general cornwallis's
plundered treasure

05:19.469 --> 05:21.394
Have never been recovered.

05:21.547 --> 05:24.230
Let me ask you this.
What happened to cornwallis

05:24.325 --> 05:26.232
-After his defeat at yorktown?
-It's a great question.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.218
He never shows up

05:28.236 --> 05:30.978
For the official
retreat-defeat ceremony.

05:31.073 --> 05:33.665
He just kind of takes off.

05:33.892 --> 05:35.983
We also know that he was
destroying his own ships

05:36.078 --> 05:37.836
So that the americans
and the french

05:37.987 --> 05:40.154
Couldn't take them
and use them, or...

05:40.174 --> 05:42.174
So, you know, that could
be an act of defiance.

05:42.325 --> 05:45.677
It could be an act of hiding
what he had plundered

05:45.904 --> 05:48.588
Because he was plundering things
from the colonists.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.849
And so, the idea would be that
maybe he secreted the treasure

05:51.076 --> 05:53.093
Before he took off.

05:53.245 --> 05:55.169
-Marty: Mm-hmm.
-And it makes a lot
of historical sense.

05:55.263 --> 05:56.855
There's precedent for that.

05:57.006 --> 05:59.099
There are treasure hunters
who have found artifacts

05:59.193 --> 06:01.526
-In that area of the york river.
-How do you know all this?

06:01.678 --> 06:05.755
Well, great question.
There's a guy named matt howell.

06:05.849 --> 06:08.349
He has reached out to us,
and he believes

06:08.443 --> 06:11.428
He knows where
cornwallis's treasure is.

06:11.521 --> 06:14.188
Well, that sounds
quite interesting.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.949
-He's standing by
if you want to talk to him.
-I'd love to hear.

06:16.101 --> 06:17.951
-Matty: All right.
-Let's find out what he knows.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.769
Matty:
There he is.

06:19.788 --> 06:21.438
-Hello, matt!
-Hello, matt!

06:21.456 --> 06:24.124
Gentlemen, thank you
for taking my call.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.367
-Welcome to the war room.
-Thanks. It's, uh...

06:26.461 --> 06:28.128
It's a pleasure to be here.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.205
Uh, I'm-I'm super excited
to bring you guys this story.

06:31.299 --> 06:32.949
How did you even get into this?

06:33.042 --> 06:34.634
You said
you were a firefighter?

06:34.786 --> 06:36.728
Yeah, by trade,
I'm a firefighter-paramedic,

06:36.955 --> 06:41.458
But for my days off,
I'm a full-time treasure hunter.

06:41.551 --> 06:43.885
My name is matt,
I'm from virginia.

06:43.979 --> 06:48.131
I've been a firefighter
since 2007,

06:48.150 --> 06:51.076
And a paramedic since 2012.

06:51.303 --> 06:55.989
I've always been interested
in stories, history

06:56.141 --> 06:58.475
And treasure hunting
probably my whole life.

06:58.568 --> 07:00.810
I would say I really
became passionate

07:00.829 --> 07:03.571
About actively searching
about ten years ago.

07:03.590 --> 07:07.426
And ever since that time,
I have found a lot of artifacts

07:07.653 --> 07:09.761
And documented them.

07:09.913 --> 07:14.749
Virginia, to me, is
the epicenter of u.S. History.

07:14.768 --> 07:20.421
It goes back to a group
of settlers setting up roots.

07:20.515 --> 07:24.276
And that start is what expanded

07:24.427 --> 07:27.170
What we know
as the united states.

07:27.189 --> 07:31.024
A lot of treasure story
is mystery.

07:31.176 --> 07:34.010
And then the other part
of it is adventure.

07:34.029 --> 07:37.289
It's way more than a hobby.
I guess it's a passion.

07:37.516 --> 07:40.441
Tell us about this story,
this cornwallis thing.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.035
Why-why this one?
Is this your...

07:42.187 --> 07:44.463
Is this your number one
treasure hunt, then?

07:44.690 --> 07:46.781
Yeah, so, currently this is
my number one treasure hunt,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.467
And I'll tell you why.

07:48.618 --> 07:52.696
This lays its roots
into the location

07:52.789 --> 07:56.641
Where I live,
and, uh, the foundations

07:56.868 --> 08:00.553
Of the united states
happened around cornwallis.

08:00.706 --> 08:04.057
I found this news article
from 1909,

08:04.151 --> 08:07.319
And there was a gentleman who
lived very close to where I was.

08:07.470 --> 08:10.880
And he said, "emphatically,
I have the whereabouts

08:10.899 --> 08:12.732
To the cornwallis treasure."

08:12.884 --> 08:15.552
And he says,
"it's a copper chest

08:15.645 --> 08:18.555
Filled with gold bullion
and diamonds."

08:18.648 --> 08:22.392
And he said, "the cornwallis
treasure is buried

08:22.485 --> 08:25.061
"in the traditional
british style,

08:25.154 --> 08:27.747
"under several yards
of good earth,

08:27.899 --> 08:31.426
And it lies along the banks
of the york river."

08:32.587 --> 08:35.071
What's the justification
for you believing

08:35.164 --> 08:37.682
That he would hide treasure
on the york river?

08:37.834 --> 08:39.351
There's a number

08:39.578 --> 08:42.262
Of really well-documented,
published letters.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.766
The cornwallis letters,
and they document his movements.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.343
Matty:
Interesting.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.939
Howell:
His travel routes mirrored
the york river.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.866
Marty:
Okay.

08:55.852 --> 08:57.594
Howell:
The york is composed

08:57.687 --> 09:00.764
Of the mattaponi river
and the pamunkey river.

09:00.857 --> 09:02.766
It was the superhighway
of traffic

09:02.784 --> 09:04.601
During the colonial period.

09:04.694 --> 09:07.270
So, do you think
he was burying this stuff

09:07.363 --> 09:09.697
Before the ultimate defeat
at yorktown?

09:09.791 --> 09:13.777
I believe that by this time,
in 1781,

09:13.870 --> 09:16.963
He has amassed enough
in his strongbox

09:17.115 --> 09:20.207
That he doesn't want
to carry it.

09:20.227 --> 09:24.137
He's trying to get to yorktown
as quickly as possible,

09:24.289 --> 09:26.898
And he knows any extra weight
is going to slow him down.

09:27.125 --> 09:30.810
So, as the original
newspaper article said,

09:30.904 --> 09:34.221
It's possible he buried it
under the banks of a river.

09:34.316 --> 09:36.724
I don't believe
he would've actually

09:36.743 --> 09:41.154
Marked the spot with any sort
of object or anything like that.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.974
But I think he would have used
a landmark that would make sense

09:45.068 --> 09:47.827
That would be easy
to come back to.

09:47.979 --> 09:51.815
Maybe it was a dock,
maybe it was a pier or a piling.

09:51.908 --> 09:54.834
From what I know,
everything has been searched

09:54.986 --> 09:57.503
Around the yorktown area.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.839
If a treasure hasn't been found,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.433
It's like einstein says.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.935
You can't go
and do the same thing over

10:04.162 --> 10:06.496
And over again
and expect different results.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.665
So, we have to go out
and look in a different manner

10:08.683 --> 10:10.108
And in a different place.

10:10.335 --> 10:12.277
-Exactly.
-Marty: Why don't you tell us

10:12.504 --> 10:15.171
Where do you think it is and why
and what do you want to do?

10:15.264 --> 10:19.192
So, I have a crew,
and we will be searching

10:19.344 --> 10:23.455
On a tributary of the york--
the pamunkey river--

10:23.682 --> 10:26.015
Looking for what we would
consider a ghost town.

10:26.109 --> 10:28.201
There's no remnants
of structures,

10:28.295 --> 10:32.372
There's no foundations,
but we know the town was there.

10:32.524 --> 10:36.468
We'll be diving on this area
where we believe the treasure is

10:36.695 --> 10:38.803
And where other people
haven't searched.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.789
We do know, from research
of the cornwallis letters

10:41.808 --> 10:43.642
And some of the local reference,

10:43.869 --> 10:48.388
That this town was
the last known location he was

10:48.482 --> 10:51.708
Before he started building
those defenses at yorktown.

10:51.801 --> 10:54.394
-Wow.
-How big is this elephant
you're hunting?

10:54.546 --> 10:57.213
I mean, how much money
could we be talking about?

10:57.306 --> 11:01.308
The original newspaper article
said $2 million.

11:01.403 --> 11:03.553
So that's 1909.

11:03.571 --> 11:06.981
Today, we're looking
at about $65 million

11:07.075 --> 11:10.059
Worth of cornwallis's treasure.

11:10.078 --> 11:12.562
-Sounds intriguing.
-Matty: Absolutely.

11:12.655 --> 11:14.414
Marty:
So, what's your...
What's your plan?

11:14.508 --> 11:16.399
How-how do you want to do it?

11:16.492 --> 11:18.343
Yeah, I'll be handling
the diving,

11:18.570 --> 11:22.496
And I have one of my crew
who will be on the shore,

11:22.590 --> 11:26.576
But we could use one more,
uh, with a metal detector.

11:26.669 --> 11:29.579
You know,
the more eyes on the ground,

11:29.597 --> 11:32.415
The more boots working,
the better chance you have.

11:32.508 --> 11:35.026
We might be able
to help you out, matt.

11:35.178 --> 11:36.920
I would love
to reach out to nikoline,

11:36.938 --> 11:39.531
If-if you'll have us, matt?
And what about you two?

11:39.758 --> 11:42.850
I don't think we're gonna be
able to spare time on this one,

11:42.944 --> 11:44.869
But I think you should go.

11:45.096 --> 11:46.930
I think you should help him out
with what he needs,

11:46.948 --> 11:48.781
And I think
you should report back here

11:48.934 --> 11:51.100
-With a handful
of colonial treasure.
-(rick laughs)

11:51.119 --> 11:52.693
Sound good, matt?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.771
I can't wait. Let's get on it.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.197
Let's chase cornwallis.
Let's go!

11:56.291 --> 11:57.549
-All right.
-All righty.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.551
-Marty: Make it so.
-Matty: Yes, sir.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.058
Nikoline:
Matty,

12:07.210 --> 12:08.952
-Thank you so much
for inviting me along.
-Oh, please.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.804
When we heard from matt,
and talked about

12:11.957 --> 12:13.806
Possibly being able to find

12:13.959 --> 12:15.734
-Tossed treasure...
-Mm-hmm.

12:15.885 --> 12:18.570
...By revolutionary general
cornwallis, I'm like, "well,

12:18.721 --> 12:20.554
"we got to get you out there
and start looking

12:20.574 --> 12:22.389
-For-for artifacts," right?
-Yes!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.968
Narrator:
In mechanicsville, virginia,

12:24.986 --> 12:28.246
Matty blake and metal-detecting
expert nikoline bohr

12:28.397 --> 12:30.231
Are on their way to assist

12:30.250 --> 12:32.399
Local treasure hunter
matt howell and his team

12:32.419 --> 12:37.422
In a search for an estimated $65
million in plundered valuables

12:37.573 --> 12:39.591
Believed to be connected
to the british

12:39.818 --> 12:42.594
Revolutionary war general
charles cornwallis.

12:42.821 --> 12:44.929
-Matty: This is it.
-Nikoline: Very nice.

12:46.658 --> 12:48.749
-Matt! Hey!
-How are you, buddy?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.159
-Good! Great to see you guys!
-Going out, yes?
-Hi!

12:50.178 --> 12:51.177
Howell:
It's so cool to have

12:51.329 --> 12:53.997
Matty and nikoline come to us.

12:54.015 --> 12:55.256
Let's go inside
where it's a little cooler,

12:55.275 --> 12:56.332
And, uh, see
what we got going on.

12:56.351 --> 12:58.092
Awesome, love it.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.446
To show them our path,
and our method.

13:01.597 --> 13:04.783
We are treasure hunters
at heart, and research is key.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.767
Howell:
Beautiful.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.529
Narrator: Joining matt are
fellow diver brad polack,

13:09.681 --> 13:13.032
Researcher and metal-detecting
expert ross walker

13:13.184 --> 13:15.518
And dallas weston, a researcher

13:15.537 --> 13:17.854
Who has been studying
colonial american history

13:17.872 --> 13:19.872
For more than 50 years.

13:20.025 --> 13:21.299
I can't wait to see, uh,
what you have here,

13:21.450 --> 13:23.192
But-but first of all,

13:23.211 --> 13:25.470
Can you show me where exactly
we're going today?

13:25.697 --> 13:29.882
We're looking
at a period map of virginia,

13:30.035 --> 13:31.384
And the travels of cornwallis.

13:31.536 --> 13:34.295
We'll be working off
the york river today

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
-And its tributaries.
-Matty: So,

13:35.965 --> 13:37.707
I see york river here.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.818
So, legend says
the treasure is where? Here?

13:39.969 --> 13:42.821
-Here. Yorktown.
-Okay. And where are we going?

13:42.972 --> 13:45.973
Up here, in the pamunkey...
On the banks of the pamunkey.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.308
-On the banks of the pamunkey?
-Yeah.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.734
And why?

13:48.887 --> 13:50.386
That was one of his last stops

13:50.479 --> 13:52.388
Before he made it
to-to yorktown.

13:52.407 --> 13:54.223
Interesting.

13:54.242 --> 13:56.317
You can see right from the map,
it's more hidden.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.003
Back in these waters,
you can hide.

13:59.155 --> 14:02.415
We personally believe that
he would've used a landmark,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.417
Whether a port,

14:04.569 --> 14:07.345
A ferry crossing or a dock.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.663
He would have used something
that was prominent enough

14:09.683 --> 14:12.408
That he could remember
where it was

14:12.501 --> 14:13.926
-To go and get it.
-Nikoline: Mm.

14:14.079 --> 14:16.003
Narrator:
From his research,

14:16.022 --> 14:18.005
Matt has identified
the possible location

14:18.024 --> 14:20.174
Of a port town that once existed

14:20.193 --> 14:21.860
Along the banks
of the pamunkey river,

14:22.011 --> 14:24.437
Which he believes
could be connected

14:24.531 --> 14:27.681
To the buried treasure
of general charles cornwallis.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.259
Although no evidence
remains today

14:30.278 --> 14:32.778
Of this once-thriving community
and its dock system,

14:32.931 --> 14:36.766
During the colonial period,
it was a recognizable center

14:36.784 --> 14:39.936
Of commerce and transportation
located in an area

14:39.954 --> 14:42.605
That general cornwallis
is known to have looted

14:42.698 --> 14:45.383
And burned
more than 200 years ago.

14:45.534 --> 14:48.052
Howell:
Cornwallis and his pillaging
and plundering

14:48.204 --> 14:50.780
Would have been
accumulating wealth--

14:50.798 --> 14:53.040
Spoils of war, so to speak.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.542
He wants to hide it
from everyone.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.454
We are going to be
looking specifically

14:58.547 --> 15:00.881
For what we believe
to be a port

15:00.901 --> 15:03.050
Where a number of ships
would have landed

15:03.144 --> 15:05.386
Over the course of years,

15:05.405 --> 15:08.314
And we want to find evidence
of his looting, his pillaging.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.224
Now what happened
with these rivers is,

15:10.243 --> 15:12.151
-They shifted over the years.
-Sure.

15:12.303 --> 15:15.729
So if he built a hide
for his treasure,

15:15.749 --> 15:18.416
It could now be either
in the shallow water

15:18.567 --> 15:22.662
Or into the near deep water--
30, 40, maybe even 50 feet deep.

15:22.814 --> 15:24.571
-Wow. It gets that deep?
-Mm-hmm.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.258
Narrator:
Over the past two centuries,

15:27.410 --> 15:30.595
The natural watercourse of
the pamunkey river has shifted

15:30.822 --> 15:33.932
In certain areas
by as much as 100 feet.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.769
This means that any treasure
that general charles cornwallis

15:37.920 --> 15:42.089
May have buried near the
riverbank on dry land in 1781

15:42.108 --> 15:44.776
Could be submerged
under water today.

15:44.927 --> 15:47.612
Now, if there's one thing
I like more than talking

15:47.839 --> 15:49.839
About history, it's going
and hunting history.

15:49.857 --> 15:52.341
-So, let's go do it!
-Let's do it.
-Yes.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.618
All right!

16:01.461 --> 16:03.019
Matty:
All right, so what's the plan?

16:03.112 --> 16:05.446
So, the other crew's
already out.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.781
-Uh, they're getting set up.
-Okay.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.526
And we are going
to go catch up with them.

16:10.545 --> 16:14.455
We're looking for a town
that doesn't exist anymore.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.976
There's no signs that this thing
was once there to begin with.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.460
So, how do you even know
about it?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.703
Ross:
Yeah, we've scouted this spot.

16:20.722 --> 16:22.647
We've found a couple relics

16:22.798 --> 16:26.225
To give us some inclination
that there was something there.

16:26.377 --> 16:28.711
Howell:
Right. So, we haven't found
any huge concentration,

16:28.730 --> 16:30.471
But we're looking
for that concentration today.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.549
We're looking
for remnants of structures.

16:33.568 --> 16:37.328
-Got it.
-We're looking for
those broken household items,

16:37.480 --> 16:40.573
And maybe, if we get lucky,
maybe we'll find something

16:40.725 --> 16:42.667
That-that we can
direct link, maybe something

16:42.818 --> 16:43.909
With a name on it.

16:44.062 --> 16:45.003
Matty:
Let's treasure hunt.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.153
The goal today is,

16:46.247 --> 16:48.506
If they can find the town,

16:48.657 --> 16:52.010
If it is where they think it is,
somewhere along these banks,

16:52.161 --> 16:55.404
You might find his treasure, but
you got to find the town first.

16:55.423 --> 16:57.849
So, if they can find anything
that is of period,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.833
Then they're on their way.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.578
All right, so,
what do we need to do?

17:02.597 --> 17:03.521
Let's divide and conquer.

17:03.672 --> 17:05.023
-Love it.
-Right?

17:05.174 --> 17:07.191
So, we'll have you guys
on the banks.

17:07.343 --> 17:09.676
-We'll get you guys, uh, set up
with some water gear...
-Mm-hmm.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.863
...And looking
through that shallow water,

17:12.014 --> 17:13.773
Looking for those targets.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.941
We'll throw on the scuba gear,
and we'll take care

17:16.036 --> 17:18.444
Of that seven-foot-range
all the way down to 40 foot.

17:18.596 --> 17:19.945
-Great.
-Nikoline: Wow.

17:20.098 --> 17:21.873
So, with both of us working,

17:22.024 --> 17:25.025
I think we have a better chance
of nailing down some more clues,

17:25.045 --> 17:27.286
If not coming up
with something big.

17:27.438 --> 17:28.862
Matty:
That sounds awesome.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.339
-Yeah, let's get wet.
-Yeah, let's go.

17:31.776 --> 17:34.293
Howell:
So, today, we're going
to try to prove

17:34.445 --> 17:36.629
That a ghost town was here,

17:36.723 --> 17:40.800
With shallow water detecting
and diving underwater.

17:40.952 --> 17:42.952
-All right, we ready?
-Yeah.

17:42.970 --> 17:46.380
Howell:
If we could find
a military button or

17:46.399 --> 17:50.068
Pieces of destruction,
I think we'll be successful.

17:50.219 --> 17:52.812
-I'm going to get started.
-All right! Go find something.

17:52.964 --> 17:56.557
Narrator:
In order to search for clues
and potential valuables

17:56.576 --> 17:58.818
In the shallow waters
near the riverbank,

17:58.970 --> 18:01.228
Ross and nikoline are using

18:01.247 --> 18:04.064
Minelab equinox 800
metal detectors,

18:04.084 --> 18:06.976
Which are capable of
distinguishing between targets

18:07.069 --> 18:09.069
That are ferrous--
such as iron--

18:09.089 --> 18:13.240
And those made of non-ferrous
materials like silver and gold.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.242
Ross:
Got a lot of iron over here.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.910
Nikoline:
That's a really good indication

18:16.930 --> 18:19.580
That there was activity
in this area.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.582
Narrator:
They are also using
floating sifters

18:21.601 --> 18:23.750
To clean mud
and sediment off of any

18:23.770 --> 18:27.663
Potentially important artifacts
that they might discover.

18:27.682 --> 18:30.166
-(beeping)
-nikoline: Did you
get something?

18:30.184 --> 18:32.168
-Shotgun shell.
-Oh.

18:32.186 --> 18:34.445
Ross:
Daggone duck hunters.

18:37.766 --> 18:38.616
Matty:
Divers in.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.103
Brad:
Matt and I'll be diving today.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.771
The first spot
that we're going to visit

18:44.791 --> 18:46.624
Is known for having
really low visibility.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.949
The best thing we have
to work with would be the sounds

18:55.969 --> 18:57.468
That we're hearing,
so, we'll listen

18:57.620 --> 19:00.029
For the metal detector
and try to discriminate

19:00.047 --> 19:02.031
What we're hearing
and what the targets are,

19:02.049 --> 19:04.383
And hopefully recover,
you know, a piece of treasure.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.103
This is matty with a comm check.
You guys got me? Over.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.708
Ah.

19:12.727 --> 19:16.061
Brad:
The dive conditions here
are pretty rough for us.

19:16.214 --> 19:18.138
There's really low visibility,

19:18.158 --> 19:19.973
A whole bunch
of leaves and debris

19:19.993 --> 19:22.067
That are running through
the water pretty fast.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.494
We've got really high current,

19:23.646 --> 19:25.554
Lots of entanglements
with trees,

19:25.573 --> 19:28.166
Leftover fishing nets,
things of that nature.

19:28.393 --> 19:30.576
So, it can be
a dangerous situation for sure.

19:30.728 --> 19:33.337
How are things looking
down there? Over.

19:43.666 --> 19:46.851
Copy that.
Terrible conditions. Be careful.

19:48.746 --> 19:50.337
Howell:
Dark water diving--

19:50.356 --> 19:52.190
If you're a little bit
claustrophobic,

19:52.417 --> 19:55.026
Or you have a problem
with confined space,

19:55.177 --> 19:57.361
Man, this isn't for you.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.368
Howell:
I think the average person

20:04.520 --> 20:06.353
Or maybe even the, uh,

20:06.372 --> 20:08.539
Experienced scuba diver
would think

20:08.766 --> 20:11.876
We're a few points off
of legally insane.

20:12.027 --> 20:15.046
This really isn't
for most people.

20:20.869 --> 20:23.221
Copy. Go ahead.
We got ears on you. Go ahead.

20:46.729 --> 20:48.579
Copy that. Put it in the pouch,
we'll look at it topside.

20:52.234 --> 20:54.660
Matty:
Copy that, divers.
We'll be waiting.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.237
Over and out.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.665
Narrator:
In the pamunkey river
near mechanicsville, virginia,

20:59.817 --> 21:03.243
While searching
for an estimated $65 million

21:03.263 --> 21:05.838
In revolutionary war treasure,

21:05.990 --> 21:08.841
Divers matt howell
and brad polack have just made

21:08.993 --> 21:11.936
What they hope could be
an important discovery.

21:13.998 --> 21:15.681
-Matty: There he is!
-Dallas: There he is!

21:15.833 --> 21:17.016
Matty: They're coming up,
they're coming onto the boat,

21:17.168 --> 21:18.091
And they've got something
for you to look at.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.685
So, the anticipation is high,

21:19.837 --> 21:22.187
My excitement level's
really high, and, uh,

21:22.340 --> 21:24.023
It's just, like, let's see what
he's got. What does he have?

21:24.175 --> 21:25.341
I know he's got something
that he's happy about,

21:25.434 --> 21:26.784
And that make me really happy.

21:26.935 --> 21:29.361
Well, matt,
whatever is in that pouch,

21:29.514 --> 21:31.196
You earned it, my friend,

21:31.349 --> 21:33.106
'cause you were down there
a while, and you worked hard.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.126
Let's see what we've got down in
the... In the bottom of the bag.

21:35.277 --> 21:36.869
-Um...
-Ah, check that out.
-What you find?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.521
A shoe buckle.

21:38.539 --> 21:40.205
-Yeah.
-Wow. Oh, that's awesome.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.448
That's awesome!

21:41.467 --> 21:42.858
-Wow.
-Nice.

21:42.877 --> 21:44.135
Fancy and oval-shaped one, too.

21:44.362 --> 21:46.453
That's really intricate.
Yeah, look at that.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.954
-That is beautiful!
-That's pretty awesome.
-Yeah.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.623
Brad:
That's pretty cool.

21:49.717 --> 21:51.142
-Wow.
-Dallas: Yeah.

21:51.293 --> 21:52.626
We have found
period shoe buckle.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.371
It definitely puts us
in the right time frame.

21:55.389 --> 21:57.706
Howell:
American revolution, and

21:57.725 --> 21:59.299
What would you say, dallas?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.377
Uh, late 1770s, 1780s.

22:01.395 --> 22:03.988
Matty:
Sometimes items tell a story.

22:04.139 --> 22:07.566
So, if you have an 18th-century
piece like this--

22:07.718 --> 22:09.234
A, yes, it's putting it
in the right time,

22:09.387 --> 22:10.886
But b, it's ornate.

22:10.905 --> 22:13.906
This is not something
that a worker,

22:14.058 --> 22:15.982
A dock worker, would
necessarily be wearing.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.060
So then you start thinking
about, okay, whose was this?

22:18.079 --> 22:20.004
Was this a wealthy colonialist,

22:20.155 --> 22:22.414
Was this an officer,
was it cornwallis?

22:22.567 --> 22:25.417
Literally, I mean, it-it starts
to bring you down that road.

22:25.570 --> 22:27.327
Great find.

22:27.347 --> 22:30.997
Now I've got two of these...
Two of those round things

22:31.017 --> 22:32.758
-That look like
they went into a musket.
-Oh!

22:32.910 --> 22:35.578
-Nice.
-Yeah, those do look
like musket balls.

22:35.671 --> 22:39.431
-How about those?
-Wow. Holy moly!

22:39.525 --> 22:41.600
That is awesome.

22:41.752 --> 22:44.010
Howell:
Super in line
with the-the same time period

22:44.030 --> 22:45.771
Where we were looking
and what we were looking for.

22:45.923 --> 22:48.199
Absolutely.

22:48.350 --> 22:50.016
Howell:
Who would carry musket balls?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.778
The militia would've
carried musket balls,

22:52.930 --> 22:55.206
The british would've
carried musket balls,

22:55.357 --> 22:57.616
And they would've had
to have extras.

22:57.768 --> 23:00.603
Are those musket balls,
in particular, evidence

23:00.621 --> 23:03.196
That there was a town here?

23:03.216 --> 23:05.383
All right, brad, show him up.

23:05.534 --> 23:09.945
Well, one small...
One small, shiny...

23:09.964 --> 23:13.057
Ooh. Oh, that's a button
or coin?

23:13.208 --> 23:15.618
-Oh, that's a button!
-It's a button.

23:15.636 --> 23:17.728
Yes. Fantastic.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.563
You can see on the back
of it better than I can.

23:19.790 --> 23:23.234
There, you can see
the fastener right there.

23:23.461 --> 23:26.386
-Right? That is a button.
-That's a button.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.239
Does it... Does it have a
maker's mark? A lot of them did.

23:28.390 --> 23:30.132
Definitely has...
What does that say?

23:30.151 --> 23:34.136
L-london? Does that say london?

23:34.155 --> 23:35.413
-Yeah.
-That says london!

23:35.564 --> 23:38.657
-London. English made. (laughs)
-ooh!

23:38.809 --> 23:40.584
-Nice.
-That puts you
right on the map, baby!

23:40.736 --> 23:42.086
-Dallas:
I think you did it, brad.
-Wow!

23:42.237 --> 23:43.587
-You can just barely see it.
-Nice!

23:43.739 --> 23:46.148
Howell:
We think that this is evidence

23:46.167 --> 23:48.074
That there was a town here,

23:48.094 --> 23:53.264
And that there were items
directly coming from london.

23:53.491 --> 23:56.917
The significance of
what we found today

23:56.936 --> 23:59.328
Was pretty big.

23:59.346 --> 24:01.421
There could be a treasure here,

24:01.441 --> 24:04.667
But I believe there's so much
more work to be done.

24:04.685 --> 24:06.092
We're running
out of daylight here,

24:06.112 --> 24:07.445
So why don't we go
check in with nikoline?

24:07.596 --> 24:09.188
They've been searching
this whole time.

24:09.340 --> 24:09.838
Maybe they've come up
with something incredible.

24:09.857 --> 24:10.781
Yeah, let's hope.

24:13.511 --> 24:17.012
-All right, hold on.
-Are you good?
-Yeah, we're good.

24:17.031 --> 24:19.123
Matty:
This team is rolling.

24:19.274 --> 24:21.459
Item after item.
We're moving forward,

24:21.610 --> 24:23.127
But we're running out
of daylight.

24:23.354 --> 24:25.871
There's only so much
a diver can do in a day,

24:26.023 --> 24:27.690
So we're gonna have
to call it for now, but

24:27.783 --> 24:29.525
Spirits are high,
they have things

24:29.543 --> 24:30.968
They need to follow up on,

24:31.119 --> 24:32.528
And we get another crack
at this tomorrow.

24:32.621 --> 24:35.121
Well, good
to see you guys again.

24:35.216 --> 24:36.640
-Good to see you!
-Yeah.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.625
It was a long, hot day.
I mean, I know

24:38.644 --> 24:40.869
We worked hard, and I kept an
eye on you guys from a distance.

24:40.888 --> 24:42.538
You guys were
really mucking around.

24:42.556 --> 24:44.648
Uh, give me the highlights.

24:44.875 --> 24:46.800
Even though there was
no monetary value found,

24:46.894 --> 24:48.652
We still learned a lot.

24:48.804 --> 24:50.988
We've got some more experience
under our belt.

24:51.139 --> 24:53.473
And the best thing is,
we can mark these spots

24:53.567 --> 24:55.659
-Off the list on these banks.
-Mm-hmm.
-Matty: That's it.

24:55.811 --> 24:57.569
-Nikoline: Yeah.
-I mean, that's...

24:57.722 --> 24:59.238
And that's something
marty lagina says all the time.

24:59.390 --> 25:00.906
-You got to find out
where it's not.
-Mm-hmm.

25:01.058 --> 25:02.333
-Nikoline:
It's definitely not...
-To find...

25:02.560 --> 25:04.001
So you don't waste your time
mucking around

25:04.152 --> 25:05.577
In certain places.
You can mark all those off.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.004
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.
-Matty: Well, they did

25:07.231 --> 25:08.914
So well, we can just do
a highlight reel

25:09.008 --> 25:10.399
-Of their best finds,
how about that?
-Oh, wow.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.825
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.511
Matty:
Take it away, matt!

25:13.662 --> 25:17.756
We had a fantastic,
fantastic number of finds.

25:17.908 --> 25:20.409
-Aw.
-Check that out really closely.

25:20.427 --> 25:22.261
-Oh, it's beautiful!
-Where the shank is.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.595
-See?
-Oh, wow.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.189
-London!
-London.

25:25.340 --> 25:28.083
-That is awesome.
-Matty: Isn't that cool?

25:28.102 --> 25:29.418
Howell:
Yeah, it puts us right
to where we want to go, right?

25:29.436 --> 25:30.844
-Ross: Absolutely.
-Matty: Literally.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.863
And to think we only found it

25:33.090 --> 25:34.848
In pitch-black,
in 44 feet of water.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.426
-Brad: Right?
Yeah, piece of cake.
-(howell laughs)

25:37.444 --> 25:39.019
Ross:
That is cool. That puts you
right in the time period.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.596
Howell:
Yup.

25:40.614 --> 25:44.208
All right, it's been
a long, hot day.

25:44.359 --> 25:46.544
Let's go, uh,
clean this up, and, uh,

25:46.695 --> 25:48.028
-We'll do it again tomorrow.
-Let's go!

25:48.047 --> 25:49.863
Let's go! Tomorrow's the day!

25:49.882 --> 25:52.007
The search continues.

25:59.708 --> 26:02.226
Narrator: As a new day begins
near mechanicsville, virginia...

26:02.453 --> 26:03.802
Nikoline:
It's gorgeous out here.

26:03.954 --> 26:05.563
Narrator:
...Matty blake

26:05.790 --> 26:07.973
And metal detection expert
nikoline bohr

26:08.067 --> 26:10.067
Are continuing a search
of the pamunkey river

26:10.294 --> 26:13.145
With treasure hunter
matt howell and his team

26:13.239 --> 26:14.554
For an estimated

26:14.648 --> 26:17.074
$65 million in buried valuables

26:17.225 --> 26:20.060
Connected to the famed british
revolutionary war general

26:20.154 --> 26:22.913
Charles cornwallis.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.898
You guys had
a great day yesterday.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.809
-Yup.
-So, you're on a roll.
Let's keep it going.

26:26.827 --> 26:28.401
Yeah, absolutely.

26:28.495 --> 26:29.812
Matty:
There's our team.

26:29.905 --> 26:31.422
-Howell: There we go.
-Nikoline: Yay.

26:31.649 --> 26:32.648
Brad:
Today, we're diving
in the same river,

26:32.741 --> 26:34.425
But a little bit
further upstream.

26:34.652 --> 26:35.818
The volume of water
and the depth

26:35.911 --> 26:37.986
Is significantly different.

26:38.005 --> 26:41.765
Significantly more tree
entanglements and things falling

26:41.992 --> 26:44.660
On the river up here
where it's smaller.

26:44.678 --> 26:45.844
So, there's a little more
obstructions up here,

26:45.938 --> 26:47.271
A little less current.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.273
-Let's get some gear on.
-Yeah, let's go.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.092
Brad:
Matt and I spend
a lot of time together

26:52.111 --> 26:54.336
Checking on our gear,
making sure everything's safe

26:54.429 --> 26:55.838
And right for us
throughout the day...

26:55.856 --> 26:57.281
Here, matty.

26:57.508 --> 26:59.099
Brad:
...To be ready for these hunts

26:59.193 --> 27:00.600
And make sure that we're
prepared to be able to go out,

27:00.620 --> 27:02.602
Make these dives
in these rough conditions,

27:02.622 --> 27:04.179
So we have a solid plan
before we just

27:04.272 --> 27:05.772
Disappear into the darkness.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.626
All right.
Great day, everybody. Let's go.

27:09.703 --> 27:11.420
Nikoline:
Wooh!

27:12.539 --> 27:13.964
Dallas:
Divers are in.

27:17.878 --> 27:21.138
Check, check. Matty on surface
looking for a comm check.

27:26.312 --> 27:30.555
Brad, hear you loud
and clear, my friend.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.891
Divers, how are the conditions
down there?

27:33.043 --> 27:34.543
Is the viz
better than yesterday?

27:34.636 --> 27:37.112
Anything, any targets? Over.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.666
Ooh. Keep going.

27:49.818 --> 27:54.487
Dallas, where
in your research--

27:54.507 --> 27:56.231
Based on everything
that you've learned--

27:56.250 --> 27:58.008
Where would pinpoint,
like, x marks the spot,

27:58.235 --> 27:59.826
The town was here.
Where would it be?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.661
I think it's right here
over our shoulder.

28:01.755 --> 28:04.089
-Right over here? Wow.
-Yeah.

28:04.241 --> 28:07.351
And what do we know
about the town, you know?

28:07.578 --> 28:10.670
-Just...
-It was... It was
a tobacco port.

28:10.764 --> 28:14.266
And cornwallis came through
here, we think, at least twice.

28:14.418 --> 28:16.176
Well, we know he came here once
'cause he burned the warehouses

28:16.270 --> 28:18.770
And lots of houses in the town.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.606
The problem is we can find
no concrete evidence

28:21.759 --> 28:23.608
Where the pier was.
If we can find a pier,

28:23.761 --> 28:25.427
We'd be on to something here.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.829
-(chuckles)
-yeah, absolutely.

28:30.117 --> 28:31.524
I see... I see something.

28:31.618 --> 28:33.618
Oh, we have a diver at surface.

28:33.771 --> 28:35.045
Nikoline:
Maybe he found something.

28:35.197 --> 28:37.439
Oh, he got something!

28:37.532 --> 28:40.108
-What is it?
-Matty: Oh, man!

28:40.202 --> 28:41.719
-Nikoline: Awesome.
-Oh, man!

28:41.870 --> 28:43.278
Nikoline:
This looks promising.

28:43.297 --> 28:47.391
-Matty: Oh, man!
-Oh. Here.

28:47.542 --> 28:50.969
-So, you see that iron
that matty has in his hand?
-Mm-hmm.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.454
Howell:
I think that's a piece
of the dock.

28:52.547 --> 28:54.306
Nikoline:
You think it's the dock?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.382
Dallas:
Something
that strapped wood together.

28:56.477 --> 28:58.143
-Nikoline: Definitely.
I mean, look at this brick.
-Yeah.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.963
Look at that. Is there way to
tell if it's postmodern or not?

29:01.056 --> 29:02.464
-You can... Yeah.
-Well, it has...

29:02.557 --> 29:04.132
-It's handmade.
-Yeah, it's...

29:04.226 --> 29:06.059
-Got a curve to it.
-Yup.

29:06.153 --> 29:07.803
Dallas:
It's been eroded
a whole lot, so it's smooth,

29:07.896 --> 29:09.304
But they were not real smooth

29:09.397 --> 29:10.639
-Like bricks are today.
-Yeah. Rough.

29:10.657 --> 29:12.140
Yup. So it's old.

29:12.234 --> 29:14.476
Dallas:
Yeah. That's a handmade brick.

29:14.569 --> 29:16.812
-All right, that puts you
in the time period you want.
-Yeah.

29:16.905 --> 29:19.739
Narrator:
Prior to the 1853 invention

29:19.833 --> 29:22.575
Of the brick-making machine,
which took place in England,

29:22.595 --> 29:26.004
Brick manufacturing
was done by hand

29:26.098 --> 29:28.991
During the colonial period
in north america,

29:29.084 --> 29:31.343
Using soft clay with water,

29:31.437 --> 29:34.087
Which was then finished
inside of fire kilns.

29:34.181 --> 29:37.516
Is it possible that this
handmade brick offers evidence

29:37.610 --> 29:39.501
Of the 18th-century town

29:39.594 --> 29:41.278
Where matt howell
and his team believe

29:41.505 --> 29:44.264
General cornwallis
may have buried a large cache

29:44.358 --> 29:45.674
Of looted valuables?

29:45.767 --> 29:48.601
People do not make
handmade bricks anymore.

29:48.695 --> 29:51.604
And it's really cool, because
when you hold it up like this,

29:51.624 --> 29:54.440
You can see that it is
a little thicker on one side,

29:54.460 --> 29:56.460
It begins to warp a little bit
in a way

29:56.611 --> 29:58.611
That a machine-made brick
wouldn't.

29:58.705 --> 30:02.633
Therefore, this brick places us
back in cornwallis's time.

30:02.860 --> 30:05.636
This could be
from one of the structures

30:05.863 --> 30:07.879
-Of this ghost town.
-Oh, yeah. Definitely. Yeah.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.790
Yeah, we need to see what volume
of brick is in there.

30:10.884 --> 30:12.792
-Matty: Right.
-Nikoline: Mm.

30:12.886 --> 30:14.886
-Um, there's got
to be more, though.
-Matty: Right.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.539
-Howell: Dallas?
-Yeah?

30:17.632 --> 30:20.317
I legit found the best signs

30:20.544 --> 30:23.061
Of a dock
I've ever seen over there.

30:23.213 --> 30:27.157
I was finding timbers
that were cut square

30:27.384 --> 30:28.975
That were stuck down
in the mud...

30:28.994 --> 30:31.386
-Nikoline: Mm. Hmm.
-...And big flat decking.

30:31.479 --> 30:32.830
Where I first dropped down...

30:33.057 --> 30:34.814
-Dallas: Yeah.
-...On the left-hand side.

30:34.908 --> 30:37.167
-I think that's got
to be where it is.
-It has to be.

30:37.394 --> 30:40.170
-I've never seen anything
like that.
-Hmm.

30:40.322 --> 30:45.233
Finding this dock, finding
these pieces, it's huge for us.

30:45.327 --> 30:48.494
It says
that we're on the right track.

30:48.589 --> 30:50.663
It says that the people

30:50.683 --> 30:54.076
Who wrote these things down
long ago weren't lying.

30:54.169 --> 30:55.760
They're telling you the truth,

30:55.855 --> 30:58.171
And you just had to go look
for that truth.

30:58.265 --> 30:59.764
Now we need to get under there,

30:59.917 --> 31:01.841
And we need
to find some targets

31:01.861 --> 31:03.861
-That show
that people were here.
-Matty: Got it.

31:04.088 --> 31:05.587
That those british troops
came through here.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.364
-Nikoline: Mm.
-Matty: Got it.

31:07.515 --> 31:08.848
-We got to get something
that's personal now.
-Matty: Got it.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.258
And you're on a roll.
Let's keep it going.

31:10.352 --> 31:12.035
-Brad, you ready?
-Yeah, let's go.

31:33.467 --> 31:35.708
Matty:
When you're doing
underwater treasure hunting,

31:35.802 --> 31:37.953
There's just an energy in the
air and excitement in the air

31:37.971 --> 31:40.805
Because you're literally
pulling history from the water.

31:40.958 --> 31:42.715
So, the anticipation is high.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.626
My excitement level's
really high,

31:44.645 --> 31:47.979
But it's a little scary,
'cause it's black-water diving.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.965
Huge, strong currents.

31:49.983 --> 31:52.868
They can't see their hand
in front of their face.

32:12.005 --> 32:14.097
Matt, confirm. Confirm.

32:14.324 --> 32:16.934
Did you say
you saw bricks? Over.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.438
Oh!

32:21.665 --> 32:23.331
Yes!

32:23.425 --> 32:26.501
-That's good, dallas.
-It is.

32:26.520 --> 32:30.505
Big pile of bricks.
Confirmed. Over. Great job.

32:30.598 --> 32:32.432
Oh, that's-that's
what you wanted.

32:32.526 --> 32:34.434
This is the moment you want
as a treasure hunter, right?

32:34.453 --> 32:37.529
You want to find
that validating piece.

32:37.681 --> 32:39.197
Even if it's not "the treasure."

32:39.291 --> 32:42.108
You are finding the piece
of the puzzle that says,

32:42.127 --> 32:43.794
"I'm in the right place,
continue the search."

32:47.708 --> 32:48.799
-Nikoline: Ooh!
-Matty: Ooh!

32:55.032 --> 32:57.866
You just gave topside
the chills!

32:57.959 --> 32:59.384
-(laughs)
-way to go, matt!

32:59.536 --> 33:01.627
Great to hear it.
Keep going. Over.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.146
You can hear the excitement
in his voice.

33:03.373 --> 33:04.314
-Nikoline: Mm.
-Matty: That's what it is.

33:04.541 --> 33:06.483
I hear that.

33:06.634 --> 33:11.154
Howell:
We got on the bottom today,
and the current

33:11.306 --> 33:13.639
Was absolutely
kicking our butts.

33:13.734 --> 33:17.219
It's dark, it's cold, it's wet,

33:17.312 --> 33:19.979
But you get that beep
on the machine.

33:20.073 --> 33:21.456
It's exhilarating.

33:25.579 --> 33:29.172
Yes! Confirm.
Targets acquired.

33:29.324 --> 33:31.416
Great job, fellas. Over.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.302
There he is. We have a diver
on the surface.

33:35.497 --> 33:37.973
-All right, he's good.
-Nikoline: Yay!

33:39.184 --> 33:41.000
We got a happy diver.

33:41.094 --> 33:43.595
Howell:
Coming out of the water,
all you want do is just

33:43.689 --> 33:47.357
Rip your bag open
and share it with the world

33:47.509 --> 33:48.917
And share it with the guys

33:49.010 --> 33:51.194
Who are in that same journey
with you.

33:52.589 --> 33:54.197
-Hand me the goods!
-Nikoline: All right.

33:55.926 --> 33:57.701
-Matty: No peeking.
-Oh, it's heavy.

33:58.762 --> 34:00.203
Oh!

34:00.430 --> 34:02.039
Howell:
That's what we were looking for.

34:02.266 --> 34:03.874
-Matty: Yes!
-Howell: Yeah.
-Wow.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.548
Matty: Well, you know comms
on a dive can be hit or miss,

34:11.775 --> 34:13.625
But I have rarely--
matter of fact, I'd say

34:13.719 --> 34:15.777
I don't think I've ever heard
a diver as happy as you were

34:15.870 --> 34:17.962
Through those comms
a few minutes ago.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.373
Um, what were you seeing
before we look at what's here?

34:20.467 --> 34:22.559
I'm really, really excited.

34:22.786 --> 34:25.120
I was in enough bricks down
there to build a whole city.

34:25.213 --> 34:27.289
-Oh, my gosh!
-The entire bottom

34:27.382 --> 34:31.293
Of the river right here,
absolutely packed full.

34:31.386 --> 34:32.235
-Awesome work!
-Howell: That's a...

34:32.387 --> 34:34.387
That's a pretty good dive.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.648
While we were under water,
we were finding countless

34:36.800 --> 34:39.559
Bricks just scattered
along the bottom.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.061
It looked like
it could've been the bricks

34:42.155 --> 34:44.322
That built this ghost town.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.324
Without any further ado, let's
take a look at what you got.

34:46.418 --> 34:50.253
So, just by tradition, we've got
to go for the big pouch first.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.481
(nikoline gasps)

34:53.500 --> 34:55.592
Matty:
Whoa!

34:55.819 --> 34:58.820
Oh, man! Look at...

34:58.913 --> 35:01.656
Howell:
Is it a button,
or is it a horse rosette

35:01.749 --> 35:03.508
-Or a bridle rosette?
-Nikoline: Oh!
-Yeah.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.917
It almost looks like something
on a bridle, doesn't it?

35:04.937 --> 35:06.344
Yeah, it's got
a different attachment point

35:06.496 --> 35:08.330
-On the back there.
-It's a heavy, uh...

35:08.348 --> 35:10.273
Matty:
That does look like
something on a saddle.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.092
Howell:
When I saw this piece
on the bottom,

35:13.186 --> 35:16.187
This made me very excited.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.948
That's a pewter spoon.

35:18.099 --> 35:19.357
-Nikoline: Hmm.
-Matty: Oh, wow.

35:19.509 --> 35:21.176
Oh, wrapped.
Check that out. Wow.

35:21.269 --> 35:23.102
Howell:
But it's wrapped up
intentionally.

35:23.196 --> 35:26.030
-Get out!
-Yeah.
-How fun.

35:26.183 --> 35:27.866
-It's got cut marks on the side.
-Holy moly.

35:28.018 --> 35:30.943
And it's been
intentionally bent around.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.204
Dallas:
Yeah, we have found
period silverware

35:33.298 --> 35:34.631
And spoons like that.

35:34.782 --> 35:36.691
The british was...
That was one

35:36.784 --> 35:38.376
Of their prime ways
of destroying

35:38.470 --> 35:40.786
Silverware and spoons and things
was just wrap it up in a knot.

35:40.881 --> 35:44.032
So, this is a-a...
An act of-of-of...

35:44.050 --> 35:45.625
-Howell: Malice.
-Malice.

35:45.719 --> 35:46.726
-Yeah.
-Dallas: Yeah.
-How crazy!

35:48.205 --> 35:50.221
Howell:
The rolled-up spoon,
it had cut marks.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.982
It was done purposely,

35:52.209 --> 35:55.059
So I believe this is cornwallis,
this was his troops,

35:55.154 --> 35:56.653
And this is what he was doing.

35:56.804 --> 35:58.713
All right, so what's next?

35:58.732 --> 36:00.824
-You ready?
-Mm-hmm.
-Matty: I don't think I am.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.828
-Nikoline: (gasps) ah!
-Matty: You have a coin!

36:04.979 --> 36:06.312
That's a coin.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.314
-That's a coin!
-Brad: All right.

36:08.408 --> 36:10.000
Howell:
You know what is it?

36:10.151 --> 36:11.726
I think I know what it is.
Just from seeing a bust.

36:11.745 --> 36:13.503
Is that the king?

36:13.730 --> 36:14.746
Let's see that side?

36:14.840 --> 36:17.340
I can see lady liberty on it.

36:17.567 --> 36:20.752
Yeah, I think that's
a liberty cap large cent,

36:20.846 --> 36:24.422
And that would date to the first
minted american coinage.

36:24.574 --> 36:26.424
Wow.

36:26.518 --> 36:31.504
The very first liberty cap
was minted about 1793-1794.

36:31.598 --> 36:32.672
-So...
-So, what would this tell you?

36:32.691 --> 36:34.082
Howell:
So this would tell us

36:34.175 --> 36:37.268
This place was
still thriving post

36:37.362 --> 36:39.196
-The american revolution.
-Yeah, after the revolution.

36:39.423 --> 36:42.532
Now, these folks are the first
americans that live here.

36:42.759 --> 36:45.276
-Matty: You got a coin.
-Howell: We got a coin.

36:45.429 --> 36:47.186
That's the very first one
I have ever found.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.446
-Come on!
-Ah!

36:48.598 --> 36:49.522
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.782
-Thanks.
-Wow.

36:50.934 --> 36:52.450
Nikoline:
This coin was only minted

36:52.602 --> 36:57.047
For three years--
from 1793 until 1796.

36:57.274 --> 36:59.107
Americans were here

36:59.200 --> 37:02.460
Using the first american
coinage minted in america

37:02.554 --> 37:04.054
After the revolution.

37:04.281 --> 37:06.464
So, the goal in
the last couple days, right,

37:06.558 --> 37:11.210
For you guys was in pursuit
of cornwallis's treasure?

37:11.304 --> 37:12.954
First, we have to establish

37:12.973 --> 37:14.806
He is where we think he is,
and you had a new target

37:14.900 --> 37:16.291
Right here, right?

37:16.384 --> 37:18.217
And can we prove
the town was here?

37:18.311 --> 37:19.236
-Yeah.
-Matty: With that dock

37:19.387 --> 37:20.904
And with these finds, too.

37:21.131 --> 37:24.299
I mean, this pewter spoon alone,
I think, to me,

37:24.392 --> 37:26.818
Is evidence
what you say happened here

37:26.912 --> 37:28.470
Could have happened here, right?

37:28.488 --> 37:30.138
Yes.

37:30.231 --> 37:31.748
So, I mean,
that's a huge victory.

37:31.899 --> 37:33.808
That is a huge victory
for the last couple of days.

37:33.901 --> 37:35.977
The finds you made
have all validated.

37:36.070 --> 37:37.479
There's been nothing
along the line

37:37.497 --> 37:39.422
That has said, like,
"well, we were off."

37:39.649 --> 37:40.999
This shouldn't be here,
or nothing was here.

37:41.151 --> 37:42.500
It's been the opposite.

37:42.652 --> 37:43.501
It's been bread crumb
after bread crumb,

37:43.595 --> 37:45.077
After bread crumb.

37:45.171 --> 37:46.504
And a lot of
blood, sweat and tears,

37:46.656 --> 37:48.823
A lot of tragedy,
a lot of loss of life.

37:48.842 --> 37:50.508
Lot of great moments,
a lot of victories

37:50.602 --> 37:52.327
Happened all right here,
and you guys are bringing it

37:52.345 --> 37:54.920
Back to life, so thank you
on the behalf of everyone.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.331
Yeah.

37:56.424 --> 37:58.275
Matty:
This has opened me up to a whole

37:58.502 --> 38:01.519
New chapter of the american
revolutionary story,

38:01.671 --> 38:03.354
And it's beautiful,
it's heartbreaking,

38:03.448 --> 38:06.449
It's emotional, it's exciting,

38:06.676 --> 38:08.860
It involves ghost towns
and hidden treasure.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.289
It has been an honor to be here.

38:12.516 --> 38:14.774
Congratulations, guys.
I think you did a lot.

38:14.868 --> 38:17.201
We are super happy to share it.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.020
-Nikoline: Aw.
-I mean, just...

38:19.113 --> 38:22.799
To have you guys come
and hang out, to learn,

38:23.026 --> 38:25.043
The-the knowledge that
you guys have brought

38:25.137 --> 38:28.379
And then to be able to share
what we do and how we do,

38:28.473 --> 38:30.289
It's just, that's next-level.

38:30.383 --> 38:32.142
Howell:
I know we're in the right place.

38:32.293 --> 38:33.810
I can envision

38:34.037 --> 38:37.372
Bustling town dock
that would've been loading

38:37.465 --> 38:38.798
-And unloading ships.
-Are you gonna continue

38:38.892 --> 38:41.300
On this spot, do you think?

38:41.394 --> 38:42.710
We know we are after today.

38:42.804 --> 38:44.303
This certainly has
upped the ante.

38:44.397 --> 38:46.381
-(all laughing)
-matty: Absolutely.

38:46.474 --> 38:49.384
Howell:
I dream that
this story continues,

38:49.477 --> 38:51.052
That we get to tell it
to more people,

38:51.145 --> 38:54.222
And if we found
the treasure tomorrow,

38:54.240 --> 38:56.741
I dream we could find
another story

38:56.835 --> 39:01.821
And explore, and adventure,
and share and just keep going.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.565
-It's been inspirational.
-Yeah?

39:03.583 --> 39:05.233
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

39:05.326 --> 39:07.344
Walking in
cornwallis's footsteps.

39:07.495 --> 39:10.347
Matty:
I can't wait to tell rick
and marty about what you found.

39:15.412 --> 39:17.354
♪ ♪

39:17.505 --> 39:20.506
Rick: Hey, matt. Welcome back
to the war room.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.175
I hear congratulations
are in order.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.086
(laughs) thanks, guys.

39:25.105 --> 39:29.699
I would call this a huge
success out on the river

39:29.851 --> 39:32.276
And really, really
exciting finds.

39:32.429 --> 39:34.186
-Rick: All of these were found?
-Matty: Yes.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.039
-Wow.
-Matty: Yep.

39:36.190 --> 39:37.189
Matt, I've been dying
to ask you,

39:37.283 --> 39:39.434
Any updates since I left?

39:39.452 --> 39:42.103
We found what we think
is the actual

39:42.122 --> 39:45.531
Entire dock site
of this ghost town.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.700
I've heard rumors of it.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.611
I know guys who have
searched over it

39:49.629 --> 39:51.370
For twenty years
and never found it.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.448
Marty:
Possibly, locating that town

39:53.466 --> 39:55.892
Puts you that much closer
to finding this treasure?

39:56.043 --> 39:56.893
Howell:
Yeah.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.544
When you start to find

39:58.563 --> 40:01.231
The evidence of destruction
that we found,

40:01.382 --> 40:03.716
It only makes sense that

40:03.735 --> 40:06.310
We're possibly
one or two steps away.

40:06.463 --> 40:08.646
That's, that's cool.
You're on his trail.

40:08.798 --> 40:11.482
-One more hint, right?
-Howell: That's right.

40:11.635 --> 40:13.801
Every piece of the puzzle
to get the whole picture.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.987
What land is this on?
Is it on private land?

40:16.139 --> 40:17.897
Or state land?
Or what is it?

40:17.916 --> 40:20.658
So the commonwealth
of virginia owns

40:20.810 --> 40:23.253
Any navigable waterway bottom.

40:23.404 --> 40:25.313
Right now, we are
in the process of reporting

40:25.331 --> 40:28.240
Everything we found
to the commonwealth.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.911
And as long as we stay in the
good graces of the commonwealth,

40:31.930 --> 40:34.097
Hopefully, we'll be
allowed to return

40:34.248 --> 40:37.158
To do some more
exploration work.

40:37.177 --> 40:42.330
We've worked really hard
to roughly map the site

40:42.348 --> 40:45.442
And we want to go do
some detailed mapping, as well,

40:45.593 --> 40:49.854
To really have an understanding
of how the site is laid out

40:50.006 --> 40:52.190
And hopefully we can get into

40:52.284 --> 40:54.175
-The right area.
-Marty: You know,
if you get that

40:54.194 --> 40:56.694
Firmed up-- the relationship
with the commonwealth--

40:56.846 --> 40:58.121
-Let us know, okay?
-Yeah.

40:58.348 --> 40:59.772
-Marty: We might be able
to help.
-Absolutely,

40:59.791 --> 41:01.458
You guys will be
the first ones I call.

41:01.609 --> 41:03.460
-Well, good.
-Matty: (laughs) perfect.
We'll be standing by

41:03.611 --> 41:06.111
For your call and more updates,
and matt, thank you again.

41:06.206 --> 41:08.781
Just a life-changing trip.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.708
I really do appreciate it.
Thank you.

41:10.860 --> 41:12.284
-Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.
-Marty: See ya.

41:12.304 --> 41:14.137
-Rick: Take care. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

41:16.216 --> 41:18.032
-That's impressive.
-Marty: It was very impressive.
Yeah, he is an impressive guy.

41:18.051 --> 41:20.143
It's a good, a good find.

41:20.294 --> 41:22.537
A nice treasure hunt for us
to get involved in, matty.

41:22.555 --> 41:24.296
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Well done. Well done, you.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.632
Thank you.
Great people, great story.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.300
And, um, there's one treasure
hunt, though, I know of

41:28.320 --> 41:29.652
That I hope doesn't end.

41:29.804 --> 41:31.062
-(chuckles)
-where would that be?

41:31.214 --> 41:32.822
-I don't know.
-Matty: Mm...

41:32.974 --> 41:34.991
-(laughing)
-speaking of which,
let's go see about that.

41:35.142 --> 41:36.809
There was at least
something here.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.828
-Yes, sir. We know that.
-At least that.

41:39.055 --> 41:40.497
Whoa!

41:40.648 --> 41:42.073
-Wow!
-Oh, I think so.

41:42.225 --> 41:44.650
-Wow.
-Matty: Breaking news.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.228
-Well done, matty.
-(matty laughs)

41:47.247 --> 41:48.913
-Let's go to work.
-Let's go.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.007
Matty: Let's go find that
oak island treasure, boys.

41:51.158 --> 41:53.676
