00:33.336 --> 00:34.936
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:35.005 --> 00:38.106
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.175 --> 00:38.906
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:38.975 --> 00:39.240
US.

00:39.309 --> 00:39.707
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:39.776 --> 00:41.109
AS OF TAPING, ISRAEL IS, IN THE

00:41.178 --> 00:42.577
WORDS OF ITS PRIME MINISTER, "AT

00:42.646 --> 00:43.544
WAR," FEMA RAN A TEST TO SEE HOW

00:43.613 --> 00:46.347
EFFECTIVELY OUR PHONES COULD

00:46.416 --> 00:47.949
SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF US, AND

00:48.018 --> 00:48.683
KEVIN McCARTHY WAS THE VICTIM OF

00:48.752 --> 00:50.985
THE FIRST-EVER INTRA-PARTY COUP

00:51.054 --> 00:52.420
AGAINST A SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.

00:52.489 --> 00:54.956
IT LEFT NORTH CAROLINA

00:55.025 --> 00:56.324
REPRESENTATIVE PATRICK McHENRY

00:58.495 --> 01:00.495
AS TEMPORARY SPEAKER.

01:00.564 --> 01:02.363
AND HE SEEMED PRETTY ANGRY AFTER

01:02.432 --> 01:03.831
McCARTHY'S OUSTING.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.733
>> THE CHAIR DECLARES THE HOUSE

01:05.802 --> 01:06.334
IN RECESS, SUBJECT TO THE CALL

01:06.403 --> 01:09.036
OF THE CHAIR.

01:09.105 --> 01:11.305
[LAUGHTER]

01:11.374 --> 01:13.508
>> John: WOW, THAT MAN IS MAD.

01:13.577 --> 01:14.742
WHICH IS ONLY SLIGHTLY

01:14.811 --> 01:15.743
UNDERMINED BY THE FACT THAT HE'S

01:15.812 --> 01:18.346
DRESSED LIKE A 4-YEAR-OLD WHO'S

01:18.415 --> 01:20.047
GOING TO FUCK UP THE WHOLE

01:20.116 --> 01:21.716
WEDDING.

01:21.785 --> 01:23.718
ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW SPEAKER

01:23.787 --> 01:24.819
WILL LIKELY BE HELD THIS WEEK,

01:24.888 --> 01:26.154
AND SO FAR THE FRONT RUNNERS

01:26.223 --> 01:28.422
SEEM TO BE FAR-RIGHT JIM JORDAN

01:28.491 --> 01:30.158
OR STEVE SCALISE, WHO'S BEEN

01:30.227 --> 01:31.526
DESCRIBED AS "DAVID DUKE WITHOUT

01:31.595 --> 01:33.060
THE BAGGAGE."

01:33.129 --> 01:33.661
AND YOU KNOW WHO DESCRIBED HIM

01:33.730 --> 01:34.996
AS THAT?

01:35.065 --> 01:36.464
HE DID!

01:36.533 --> 01:38.866
AND TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS

01:38.935 --> 01:42.069
DAVID DUKE -- THE FORMER GRAND

01:42.138 --> 01:43.504
WIZARD OF THE KKK -- WITHOUT THE

01:43.573 --> 01:46.307
BAGGAGE, IS A "CHOICE."

01:46.376 --> 01:47.675
THAT MAN IS ALL BAGGAGE.

01:47.744 --> 01:48.643
WITHOUT IT, HE'S JUST THE

01:48.712 --> 01:50.344
CRYPTKEEPER WITH A PATCHY BLEACH

01:50.413 --> 01:53.047
JOB.

01:53.116 --> 01:53.614
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE

01:53.683 --> 01:54.148
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BEING

01:54.217 --> 01:54.882
CONTROLLED BY THE ABSOLUTE

01:54.951 --> 01:56.484
EXTREMES.

01:56.553 --> 01:58.052
BUT NOT JUST NATIONALLY, AT THE

01:58.121 --> 01:59.086
LOCAL LEVEL TOO.

01:59.155 --> 02:00.688
AND TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW BAD

02:00.757 --> 02:02.089
IT'S GOTTEN, JUST LOOK AT THE

02:02.158 --> 02:03.357
MAYORAL RACE UNFOLDING IN THE

02:03.426 --> 02:04.459
CITY OF FRANKLIN, TENNESSEE,

02:04.528 --> 02:06.561
WHERE THEIR CURRENT REPUBLICAN

02:06.630 --> 02:09.263
MAYOR IS FACING THIS WOMAN,

02:09.332 --> 02:10.431
GABRIELLE HANSON, A REAL ESTATE

02:10.500 --> 02:12.433
AGENT AND CURRENT ALDERMAN.

02:12.502 --> 02:14.235
SHE'S BRANDED HERSELF AS A

02:14.304 --> 02:15.903
HARDCORE MAGA CANDIDATE AND HAS

02:15.972 --> 02:17.171
POSTED PHOTOS OF HERSELF AT

02:17.240 --> 02:18.473
MAR-A-LAGO.

02:18.542 --> 02:20.675
AND LOOK HOW HAPPY SHE IS THERE!

02:20.744 --> 02:22.376
THAT'S THE FACE OF SOMEONE WHO

02:22.445 --> 02:23.578
JUST DINED ON A WELL-DONE STEAK

02:23.647 --> 02:24.512
AND READ SOME CLASSIFIED

02:24.581 --> 02:27.748
DOCUMENTS ON THE TOILET.

02:27.817 --> 02:30.151
ANYWAY, BACK IN APRIL, HANSON

02:30.220 --> 02:32.353
MADE NEWS FOR OPPOSING THE

02:32.422 --> 02:33.488
CITY'S PRIDE EVENT, ARGUING ITS

02:33.557 --> 02:35.089
PARTICIPANTS COULDN'T BE TRUSTED

02:35.158 --> 02:35.690
AROUND CHILDREN, AND OFFERING

02:35.759 --> 02:36.858
THIS CRITIQUE OF PREVIOUS

02:36.927 --> 02:38.893
PERFORMERS.

02:38.962 --> 02:40.995
>> IN ONE OF THE PICTURES OF

02:41.064 --> 02:43.297
JAIDYNN DIORE FIERCE, ONE OF THE

02:43.366 --> 02:46.300
MISS FITS, SHE'S CLAD IN AN

02:46.369 --> 02:48.469
ELMO-THEMED DRAG OUTFIT, WHICH

02:48.538 --> 02:51.706
I'M SURE TO AN UNDERAGE

02:51.775 --> 02:54.142
INDIVIDUAL, THIS COULD CREATE

02:54.211 --> 02:56.043
CONFUSION IN THEIR MIND AS TO

02:56.112 --> 03:00.815
WHAT'S BEING REPRESENTED.

03:00.884 --> 03:02.416
>> John: OKAY, BUT BY THAT

03:02.485 --> 03:04.051
LOGIC, WE SHOULD OUTLAW CHILDREN

03:04.120 --> 03:06.554
FROM WALKING AROUND TIMES

03:06.623 --> 03:10.158
SQUARE, TOO, BECAUSE SEEING OLAF

03:10.227 --> 03:11.893
FROM "FROZEN" WITH HIS HEAD

03:11.962 --> 03:13.060
POPPED OFF, SMOKING A BLACK &

03:13.129 --> 03:14.395
MILD IS WAY MORE CONFUSING THAN

03:14.464 --> 03:15.029
SOMEONE WEARING EYESHADOW AND AN

03:15.098 --> 03:15.930
ELMO THEMED BODYSUIT.

03:15.999 --> 03:18.599
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, HER NAME

03:18.668 --> 03:20.268
IS JAIDYNN "DIOR" FIERCE, NOT

03:20.337 --> 03:21.569
"DIOREE," AND ELMO IS NOT

03:21.638 --> 03:22.904
REMOTELY HER FINEST WORK.

03:22.973 --> 03:24.639
BECAUSE SHE'S CONSTANTLY SERVING

03:24.708 --> 03:29.210
CARTOON LOOKS.

03:29.279 --> 03:29.911
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

03:29.980 --> 03:30.478
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MINION

03:30.547 --> 03:31.746
SERVE BODY?

03:31.815 --> 03:33.714
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOW.

03:33.783 --> 03:34.916
HANSON ALSO TRIED TO PRESSURE

03:34.985 --> 03:36.551
THE NASHVILLE AIRPORT OUT OF

03:36.620 --> 03:38.019
FUNDING A JUNETEENTH

03:38.088 --> 03:39.921
CELEBRATION, SAYING, "I DON'T

03:39.990 --> 03:41.289
WANT MY TAX DOLLARS OR FEES OFF

03:41.358 --> 03:41.823
OF PLANE TICKETS GOING TO

03:41.892 --> 03:43.925
RADICAL AGENDAS."

03:43.994 --> 03:44.892
AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU'RE

03:44.961 --> 03:45.660
TALKING TO AN AIRPORT,

03:45.729 --> 03:47.128
GABRIELLE.

03:47.197 --> 03:48.229
IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

03:48.298 --> 03:50.064
IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE.

03:50.133 --> 03:53.234
IT'S AN AIRPORT.

03:53.303 --> 03:54.602
THE ONLY FOOD AVAILABLE IS

03:54.671 --> 03:56.437
EITHER DILL PICKLE ALMONDS OR

03:56.506 --> 03:57.171
BRISKET NACHOS, WITH NO MIDDLE

03:57.240 --> 03:59.507
GROUND.

03:59.576 --> 04:00.842
IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO DRINK AT 7

04:00.911 --> 04:01.909
AM, AND THEY WILL SELL YOUR LOST

04:01.978 --> 04:03.077
LUGGAGE.

04:03.146 --> 04:04.278
THE AIRPORT IS A CRUEL,

04:04.347 --> 04:06.180
UNFEELING DIMENSION,

04:06.249 --> 04:07.381
UNINTERESTED IN YOUR CULTURE WAR

04:07.450 --> 04:09.083
BULLSHIT.

04:09.152 --> 04:10.551
NOW, SINCE THEN, HANSON SEEMS TO

04:10.620 --> 04:12.420
HAVE TRIED TO BROADEN HER BASE,

04:12.489 --> 04:14.021
POSTING PHOTOS OF DIVERSE GROUPS

04:14.090 --> 04:17.725
OF SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING THIS

04:17.794 --> 04:18.326
ONE, LABELED AS AN "EXECUTIVE

04:18.395 --> 04:19.127
WOMEN'S CLUB" WHO SHE SAID HAD

04:19.196 --> 04:22.396
PROVIDED "INVALUABLE SUPPORT AND

04:22.465 --> 04:23.131
ENCOURAGEMENT" WITH THE HASHTAG

04:23.200 --> 04:24.365
#VOTEHANSON.

04:24.434 --> 04:25.199
BUT WHILE THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE

04:25.268 --> 04:28.069
AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THOSE WOMEN,

04:28.138 --> 04:28.836
WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN A LOCAL

04:28.905 --> 04:31.506
REPORTER TRACKED ONE DOWN AND

04:31.575 --> 04:35.510
ASKED A PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.111
>> I DO NOT, I ACTUALLY DO NOT

04:37.180 --> 04:38.479
KNOW WHO THAT IS.

04:38.548 --> 04:39.714
>> AFTER SOME ON SOCIAL MEDIA

04:39.783 --> 04:41.048
NOTICED THE PIC SEEMED TO HAVE

04:41.117 --> 04:43.151
BEEN TAKEN AT A RESTAURANT IN

04:43.220 --> 04:45.186
CHICAGO, HANSON POSTED AN UPDATE

04:45.255 --> 04:46.587
ON FACEBOOK CLAIMING, "THESE ARE

04:46.656 --> 04:48.156
ALL MY FRIENDS THAT HAVE

04:48.225 --> 04:49.257
RELOCATED TO NASHVILLE,

04:49.326 --> 04:50.658
BRENTWOOD, AND FRANKLIN AND THEY

04:50.727 --> 04:53.194
ALL SUPPORT ME."

04:53.263 --> 04:54.562
THE WOMEN SAY THAT'S A LIE.

04:54.631 --> 04:55.429
>> ANY MESSAGE YOU WOULD HAVE

04:55.498 --> 04:57.398
FOR HER?

04:57.467 --> 04:59.700
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE HER TO GO

04:59.769 --> 05:02.570
MAKE GENUINE FRIENDS SO SHE CAN

05:02.639 --> 05:03.538
TAKE PHOTOS WITH THOSE FOLKS IF

05:03.607 --> 05:05.006
SHE'S LOOKING FOR SUPPORTERS.

05:05.075 --> 05:06.808
THERE'S NO NEED TO COMB PICTURES

05:06.877 --> 05:07.742
ON THE INTERNET TO MAKE UP A

05:07.811 --> 05:09.644
STORY.

05:09.713 --> 05:10.878
NONE OF US NEED THAT.

05:10.947 --> 05:12.680
>> John: WOW.

05:12.749 --> 05:14.916
NOT ONLY ARE THOSE WOMEN CLEARLY

05:14.985 --> 05:16.984
NOT YOUR FRIENDS, YOU DEFINITELY

05:17.053 --> 05:19.654
JUST UNITED THEM AGAINST YOU.

05:19.723 --> 05:21.355
I GUARANTEE YOU, ONE OF THEM

05:21.424 --> 05:22.490
DROPPED YOUR POST IN THE GROUP

05:22.559 --> 05:23.124
CHAT, AND THE REPLIES ARE STILL

05:23.193 --> 05:27.829
GOING.

05:27.898 --> 05:30.298
AND THE THING IS, HANSON HAS

05:30.367 --> 05:31.933
BEEN CAUGHT LYING ABOUT WEIRD

05:32.002 --> 05:32.900
SHIT A TRULY RIDICULOUS AMOUNT

05:32.969 --> 05:34.535
OF TIMES.

05:34.604 --> 05:35.503
EARLIER THIS YEAR, DURING A

05:35.572 --> 05:36.704
PODCAST INTERVIEW, SHE CLAIMED

05:36.773 --> 05:38.172
TO HAVE PREDICTED THE COVENANT

05:38.241 --> 05:39.974
SCHOOL SHOOTING IN NASHVILLE,

05:40.043 --> 05:41.275
STATING THAT SHE'D HAD A "GUT"

05:41.344 --> 05:42.643
PREMONITION ABOUT IT, CHALKING

05:42.712 --> 05:43.277
IT UP TO WHAT "COULD HAVE BEEN A

05:43.346 --> 05:46.647
HOLY SPIRIT THING."

05:46.716 --> 05:47.548
WHAT'S MORE, SHE ALSO CLAIMED

05:47.617 --> 05:48.683
THAT SHE'D TOLD A POLICE OFFICER

05:48.752 --> 05:50.651
ABOUT THAT PREMONITION WHEN HE

05:50.720 --> 05:51.452
CAME TO HER HOME OVER A

05:51.521 --> 05:52.753
DIFFERENT ISSUE.

05:52.822 --> 05:54.355
THE PROBLEM IS, THAT SAME LOCAL

05:54.424 --> 05:55.756
REPORTER TRACKED DOWN THAT

05:55.825 --> 05:56.991
OFFICER'S BODYCAM VIDEO, WHICH

05:57.060 --> 05:59.660
TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY.

05:59.729 --> 06:01.062
>> DURING THAT 23-MINUTE VIDEO,

06:01.131 --> 06:02.497
SHE NEVER MENTIONS ANYTHING

06:02.566 --> 06:03.030
REMOTELY LIKE THE COVENANT

06:03.099 --> 06:06.167
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

06:06.236 --> 06:08.269
NO MENTION OF A PREMONITION, NO

06:08.338 --> 06:09.137
MENTION OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER, NO

06:09.206 --> 06:11.305
MENTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

06:11.374 --> 06:12.673
AND HANSON'S FABRICATIONS HAVE

06:12.742 --> 06:14.876
GONE EVEN FURTHER IN A TALK

06:14.945 --> 06:16.878
RADIO INTERVIEW QUESTIONING HOW

06:16.947 --> 06:18.146
ACTRESS MELISSA JOAN HART

06:18.215 --> 06:19.514
HAPPENED TO BE NEAR COVENANT AT

06:19.583 --> 06:20.481
THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING TO HELP

06:20.550 --> 06:21.349
CHILDREN WHO WERE TRYING TO

06:21.418 --> 06:23.217
ESCAPE.

06:23.286 --> 06:24.719
>> WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHY

06:24.788 --> 06:25.353
MELISSA JOAN HART WAS THERE, SHE

06:25.422 --> 06:26.654
MUST HAVE KNOWN IT WAS GOING TO

06:26.723 --> 06:32.093
HAPPEN ALSO.

06:32.162 --> 06:34.395
>> John: WAIT, WHAT?

06:34.464 --> 06:34.996
"MELISSA JOAN HART PSYCHICALLY

06:35.065 --> 06:35.963
KNOWS WHEN A SCHOOL SHOOTING IS

06:36.032 --> 06:37.832
ABOUT TO HAPPEN."

06:37.901 --> 06:38.933
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING AN ELECTED

06:39.002 --> 06:40.468
OFFICIAL SHOULD SAY IN AN

06:40.537 --> 06:41.936
INTERVIEW, IT'S WHAT A DISNEY

06:42.005 --> 06:43.304
CHANNEL EXEC PROBABLY SCREAMED

06:43.373 --> 06:46.107
IN 2002, AFTER INHALING A METRIC

06:46.176 --> 06:48.910
TON OF COCAINE.

06:48.979 --> 06:49.510
[LAUGHTER]

06:49.579 --> 06:50.111
AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,

06:50.180 --> 06:51.179
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO

06:51.248 --> 06:52.079
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REPORTER, PHIL

06:52.148 --> 06:54.549
WILLIAMS.

06:54.618 --> 06:55.516
HE'S BEEN ALL OVER THIS STORY,

06:55.585 --> 06:57.552
AND WE'VE FEATURED HIS WORK ON

06:57.621 --> 06:58.719
THIS SHOW A BUNCH IN THE PAST.

06:58.788 --> 07:00.621
IF YOU'RE A POLITICIAN IN

07:00.690 --> 07:03.558
TENNESSEE, PHIL HAS HIS FOOT ON

07:03.627 --> 07:06.360
YOUR GODDAMN NECK.

07:06.429 --> 07:07.528
HIS OFFICIAL NEWS CHANNEL 5 BIO

07:07.597 --> 07:08.930
FEATURES A QUOTE FROM A

07:08.999 --> 07:12.400
NASHVILLE POLITICAL STRATEGIST,

07:12.469 --> 07:14.535
SAYING:

07:14.604 --> 07:19.340
IF THE PRESS CALLS CALL A

07:19.409 --> 07:22.376
LAWYER.

07:22.445 --> 07:22.877
THIS IS A BAD, BAD MAN.

07:22.946 --> 07:23.678
YOU DO NOT FUCK AROUND WITH PHIL

07:23.747 --> 07:23.945
WILLIAMS.

07:24.014 --> 07:24.579
AND IT SEEMS GABRIELLE HANSON IS

07:24.648 --> 07:25.746
CURRENTLY IN HER "FINDING OUT"

07:25.815 --> 07:28.216
ERA WHEN IT COMES TO HER

07:28.285 --> 07:30.318
DEALINGS WITH HIM, BECAUSE

07:30.387 --> 07:32.753
PHIL'S UNCOVERED SO MUCH WEIRD

07:32.822 --> 07:34.489
NEW CONTEXT AROUND HER LIFE.

07:34.558 --> 07:35.089
REMEMBER HER BULLSHIT OUTRAGE

07:35.158 --> 07:37.725
OVER THE LOCAL PRIDE EVENT?

07:37.794 --> 07:39.293
WELL, PHIL DISCOVERED SOMETHING

07:39.362 --> 07:41.696
HER HUSBAND ONCE DID THAT

07:41.765 --> 07:42.263
SUGGESTS A HELL OF A DOUBLE

07:42.332 --> 07:43.865
STANDARD.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.666
>> CHILDREN SEEING IMAGES THAT

07:45.735 --> 07:47.602
THEY COULD NOT UNSEE WAS WHY THE

07:47.671 --> 07:49.170
FRANKLIN ALDERMAN SAID SHE TRIED

07:49.239 --> 07:50.738
TO BLOCK A PRIDE CELEBRATION AT

07:50.807 --> 07:52.039
A FRANKLIN PARK, SAYING IN A

07:52.108 --> 07:54.142
PODCAST INTERVIEW, IT WAS A

07:54.211 --> 07:55.910
QUESTION OF BASIC MORALITY.

07:55.979 --> 07:57.979
YET, WHERE WAS HER MORALITY

07:58.048 --> 07:59.313
DURING CHICAGO'S 2008 PRIDE

07:59.382 --> 08:01.149
PARADE BEFORE THE HANSONS MOVED

08:01.218 --> 08:02.250
TO TENNESSEE?

08:02.319 --> 08:03.451
AT THE TIME, TOM HANSON WAS

08:03.520 --> 08:05.253
RUNNING A REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN

08:05.322 --> 08:07.221
FOR CONGRESS AND ORGANIZERS

08:07.290 --> 08:08.756
AGREED TO LET HIM IN.

08:08.825 --> 08:11.292
HE TOLD THE LOCAL LGBTQ

08:11.361 --> 08:11.893
NEWSPAPER, QUOTE, "SO IT JUST

08:11.962 --> 08:13.728
CAME TO ME.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.129
I SAID, MAYBE I'LL WEAR AN

08:15.198 --> 08:17.832
AMERICAN FLAG SPEEDO.

08:17.901 --> 08:18.399
AND MY WIFE SAID, IF YOU DO

08:18.468 --> 08:20.601
THAT, I'LL HOLD YOU TO IT."

08:20.670 --> 08:22.336
>> John: MAGNIFICENT.

08:22.405 --> 08:23.738
SO, TO RECAP, SNATCHED ELMO?

08:23.807 --> 08:27.008
IRREPARABLY HARMFUL TO CHILDREN.

08:27.077 --> 08:34.077
STAR-SPANGLED BALL-BAG HERE?

08:35.685 --> 08:36.350
THAT'S APPARENTLY COMPLETELY

08:36.419 --> 08:36.684
FINE WITH HER!

08:36.753 --> 08:37.251
ALSO -- AND I'M NOT HERE TO

08:37.320 --> 08:37.919
POLICE ANYONE ELSE'S DRAG --

08:37.988 --> 08:38.853
BUT IS HE...

08:38.922 --> 08:40.721
TUCKED?

08:40.790 --> 08:42.390
COULD JUST HAVE BEEN COLD!

08:42.459 --> 08:47.161
IT WAS JUNE, THOUGH.

08:47.230 --> 08:47.895
ANYWAY.

08:47.964 --> 08:48.996
AND IF ALL THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,

08:49.065 --> 08:50.765
JUST THIS WEEK, HANSON WAS

08:50.834 --> 08:51.265
CAUGHT UP IN YET ANOTHER

08:51.334 --> 08:53.434
SCANDAL.

08:53.503 --> 08:53.935
THIS TIME, INVOLVING AN

08:54.004 --> 08:55.103
EYE-CATCHING GROUP THAT SHOWED

08:55.172 --> 08:56.437
UP TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT HER AT

08:56.506 --> 08:58.739
A CANDIDATE FORUM.

08:58.808 --> 09:00.208
>> THE MAN ON THE LEFT IS SEAN

09:00.277 --> 09:01.776
KAUFFMANN, WHO HAS BEEN

09:01.845 --> 09:02.810
DESCRIBED BY THE STOP

09:02.879 --> 09:04.212
ANTISEMITISM WATCHDOG GROUP AS,

09:04.281 --> 09:05.913
QUOTE, "A DISTURBED NEO-NAZI AND

09:05.982 --> 09:09.517
HOLOCAUST DENIER WITH A

09:09.586 --> 09:10.118
DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

09:10.187 --> 09:11.419
AND A MASSIVE CACHE OF

09:11.488 --> 09:12.386
FIREARMS."

09:12.455 --> 09:13.654
THEN THERE'S BRAD LEWIS.

09:13.723 --> 09:14.922
HE'S THE OPERATOR OF THE LEWIS

09:14.991 --> 09:16.624
COUNTRY STORE ON THE FAR WEST

09:16.693 --> 09:18.426
SIDE OF NASHVILLE, A STORE KNOWN

09:18.495 --> 09:18.960
FOR ITS EXTREME RIGHT-WING

09:19.029 --> 09:20.728
MESSAGING.

09:20.797 --> 09:22.163
WHEN THE STORE RECENTLY WENT ON

09:22.232 --> 09:25.199
THE MARKET, GABRIELLE HANSON WAS

09:25.268 --> 09:25.800
THE REAL ESTATE AGENT WHO GOT

09:25.869 --> 09:26.901
THE LISTING.

09:26.970 --> 09:29.203
A RECENT INVESTIGATION BY THE

09:29.272 --> 09:30.037
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER

09:30.106 --> 09:32.573
REVEALED HOW THE SECOND FLOOR OF

09:32.642 --> 09:33.174
THE STORE WAS BEING USED AS A

09:33.243 --> 09:35.376
WHITE NATIONALIST FIGHT CLUB.

09:35.445 --> 09:37.445
LEWIS RESPONDED IN A POST ON

09:37.514 --> 09:38.946
TELEGRAM, CALLING HIMSELF AN

09:39.015 --> 09:42.150
"ACTUAL LITERAL NAZI."

09:42.219 --> 09:43.785
>> MS. HANSON, THE PEOPLE YOU'RE

09:43.854 --> 09:44.819
WITH HAD DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS

09:44.888 --> 09:46.387
LITERAL NAZIS.

09:46.456 --> 09:47.855
IS THIS THE TYPE OF PEOPLE YOU

09:47.924 --> 09:50.024
SHOULD BE ASSOCIATING WITH?

09:50.093 --> 09:50.691
>> EXCUSE ME.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.459
>> THEY SAID THEY'RE LITERAL

09:51.528 --> 09:53.594
NAZIS.

09:53.663 --> 09:57.532
>> John: AGAIN, PHIL WILLIAMS IS

09:57.601 --> 09:57.932
JUST WRECKING HER.

09:58.001 --> 10:00.101
WAVING A CELL PHONE IN HANSON'S

10:00.170 --> 10:01.068
FACE AND ASKING, "DO YOU HANG

10:01.137 --> 10:02.370
OUT WITH NAZIS OR WHAT?"

10:02.439 --> 10:03.538
AND DOING IT LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE

10:03.607 --> 10:05.406
WHOLE ROW TO HEAR.

10:05.475 --> 10:07.775
ALSO, WHAT ON EARTH DID THAT

10:07.844 --> 10:10.011
CURSED ZILLOW LISTING LOOK LIKE?

10:10.080 --> 10:10.478
"GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

10:10.547 --> 10:13.414
OWN/OPERATE YOUR BUSINESS

10:13.483 --> 10:14.248
IN THIS INCOME-GENERATING,

10:14.317 --> 10:14.882
3-UNIT MIXED-USE WHITE

10:14.951 --> 10:16.250
SUPREMACIST BUILDING.

10:16.319 --> 10:17.919
FIRST FLOOR IS A STORE WITH

10:17.988 --> 10:18.920
TERRIBLE VIBES, AND THE SECOND

10:18.989 --> 10:19.520
FLOOR UNIT IS A NEO-NAZI FIGHT

10:19.589 --> 10:20.154
CLUB.

10:20.223 --> 10:22.757
SOLD AS IS."

10:22.826 --> 10:24.792
NOW, HANSON DENIES ENGAGING THAT

10:24.861 --> 10:25.526
GROUP AS SECURITY, DESPITE THE

10:25.595 --> 10:26.394
FACT SHE WALKED INTO THAT

10:26.463 --> 10:28.963
MEETING WITH A HOLOCAUST DENIER,

10:29.032 --> 10:30.765
WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS ESCORTED

10:30.834 --> 10:32.333
IN BY A GUY WITH A "PROUD BOYS"

10:32.402 --> 10:34.402
FACE TATTOO.

10:34.471 --> 10:34.936
AND SHE'S TRIED TO DEFLECT

10:35.005 --> 10:36.671
CRITICISM OVER THE FACT SHE TOOK

10:36.740 --> 10:37.638
A LITERAL NAZI'S REAL ESTATE

10:37.707 --> 10:39.207
LISTING.

10:39.276 --> 10:40.541
BUT, EVEN IN DOING SO, MADE SOME

10:40.610 --> 10:43.244
BOLD CHOICES.

10:43.313 --> 10:45.680
>> IF YOU BASED ME ON ALL THE

10:45.749 --> 10:46.280
CLIENTS THAT I'M REPRESENTING

10:46.349 --> 10:49.250
CURRENTLY, I WOULD BE A WHITE

10:49.319 --> 10:50.118
SUPREMACIST, NEO-NAZI, I WOULD

10:50.187 --> 10:52.587
BE A LESBIAN LIKE MY ONE CLIENT,

10:52.656 --> 10:56.023
AND I WOULD BE BLACK, TOO.

10:56.092 --> 10:59.060
SO, THAT IS WHO I WOULD BE IF

10:59.129 --> 11:00.294
YOU'RE GONNA BLAME ME FOR THE

11:00.363 --> 11:01.028
CLIENTS THAT I REPRESENT,

11:01.097 --> 11:02.530
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE CLIENTS AT

11:02.599 --> 11:03.397
THIS VERY MOMENT THAT I'M

11:03.466 --> 11:03.998
REPRESENTING.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.801
AND I WOULD PROBABLY BE A MUSLIM

11:06.870 --> 11:08.503
JIHADIST AS WELL, BECAUSE I HAVE

11:08.572 --> 11:12.940
A MIDDLE EASTERN CLIENT, TOO.

11:13.009 --> 11:14.509
>> John: OKAY, GABS, BUT YOU DID

11:14.578 --> 11:16.611
JUST IMPLY ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS

11:16.680 --> 11:18.613
WAS A "MUSLIM JIHADIST," SIMPLY

11:18.682 --> 11:19.247
BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE

11:19.316 --> 11:21.082
MIDDLE EASTERN, SO I'D SAY

11:21.151 --> 11:22.517
YOU'RE PROBABLY MORE OF A WHITE

11:22.586 --> 11:23.451
SUPREMACIST NEO-NAZI THAN YOU

11:23.520 --> 11:26.554
ARE LESBIAN OR BLACK.

11:26.623 --> 11:28.022
AND LOOK, IN A WORLD THAT MADE

11:28.091 --> 11:29.824
SENSE, THIS WOMAN WOULD

11:29.893 --> 11:31.092
OBVIOUSLY HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM

11:31.161 --> 11:32.827
THIS MAYORAL RACE IN SHAME.

11:32.896 --> 11:34.595
BUT SHE STILL HAS SUPPORTERS.

11:34.664 --> 11:36.164
THERE ARE LAWN SIGNS UP FOR HER

11:36.233 --> 11:37.665
IN FRANKLIN.

11:37.734 --> 11:38.533
AND THERE'S A REAL CHANCE SHE

11:38.602 --> 11:41.436
COULD WIN THIS ELECTION.

11:41.505 --> 11:41.969
BECAUSE WHILE HER NUMEROUS

11:42.038 --> 11:43.037
SCANDALS ARE CLEARLY ALMOST

11:43.106 --> 11:45.907
CARTOONISH IN THEIR EXTREMITY,

11:45.976 --> 11:47.408
HER BEHAVIOR IS ENTIRELY

11:47.477 --> 11:48.476
EMBLEMATIC OF REPUBLICAN

11:48.545 --> 11:49.877
POLITICS FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL

11:49.946 --> 11:51.979
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP.

11:52.048 --> 11:52.914
WHERE, IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING

11:52.983 --> 11:54.348
THIS WEEK, IT'S THAT FAR-RIGHT

11:54.417 --> 11:58.453
REPUBLICANS MAINTAIN A VICE-LIKE

11:58.522 --> 11:59.020
GRIP OVER THE ENTIRE PARTY.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.189
AND OUR BEST CHANCE AT EXPOSING

12:01.258 --> 12:06.294
THEM IS IF A LOT MORE REPORTERS

12:06.363 --> 12:06.861
TAKE A PAGE FROM NASHVILLE'S

12:06.930 --> 12:08.563
NOSIEST BITCH.

12:08.632 --> 12:10.498
AND NOW, THIS.

12:10.567 --> 12:17.004
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

12:17.073 --> 12:18.473
PEOPLE ON TV SHARING

12:18.542 --> 12:21.008
INCREASINGLY UNHINGED CONSPIRACY

12:21.077 --> 12:21.609
THEORIES ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT.

12:21.678 --> 12:25.246
>> OKAY, THE BIG QUESTION IS,

12:25.315 --> 12:27.815
ARE TAYLOR SWIFT AND

12:27.884 --> 12:28.683
TRAVIS KELCE DATING?

12:28.752 --> 12:30.351
>> IT JUST MAKES YOU THINK IS

12:30.420 --> 12:32.653
THERE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON?

12:32.722 --> 12:34.856
DID TAYLOR TEAM UP WITH THE NFL,

12:34.925 --> 12:36.224
SOMETHING.

12:36.293 --> 12:37.191
IF WE ARE INVESTIGATING.

12:37.260 --> 12:39.527
IN SO MANY CONSPIRACY THEORIES

12:39.596 --> 12:40.428
ABOUT THIS.

12:40.497 --> 12:42.563
>> IS ANYTHING REALLY A

12:42.632 --> 12:43.431
CONSPIRACY THEORY THESE DAYS?

12:43.500 --> 12:47.301
A COINCIDENCE?

12:47.370 --> 12:49.370
>> MY DIRECTOR THINKS IT'S A

12:49.439 --> 12:53.174
COVER-UP TO CONCEAL TAYLOR'S

12:53.243 --> 12:56.878
TRUE BOYFRIEND WHO HE SHE WANTS TO

12:56.947 --> 12:57.512
KEEP PRIVATE.

12:57.581 --> 12:58.880
>> THE NFL IS STRUGGLING TO GET

12:58.949 --> 13:01.783
WOMEN TO WATCH FOOTBALL.

13:01.852 --> 13:05.019
>> WE ARE GETTING READY FOR

13:05.088 --> 13:06.220
TAYLOR SWIFT 1989 RE-RELEASE.

13:06.289 --> 13:08.589
THE THEME FOR THE ALBUM IS THE

13:08.658 --> 13:10.258
COLOR RED, TRAVIS KELCE PLAYS

13:10.327 --> 13:10.625
FOR THE CHIEFS.

13:10.694 --> 13:12.326
THEY ARE A BIG RED TEAM.

13:12.395 --> 13:13.928
HE WAS BORN IN 1989.

13:13.997 --> 13:16.130
>> THIS IS A PROMOTIONAL MOVE.

13:16.199 --> 13:20.701
>> TAYLOR SWIFT FROM

13:20.770 --> 13:21.202
PHILADELPHIA ORIGINALLY.

13:21.271 --> 13:22.870
MAYBE SHE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO

13:22.939 --> 13:23.638
MESS TRAVIS KELCE UP.

13:23.707 --> 13:25.940
>> YOU THINK IT SABOTAGED.

13:26.009 --> 13:28.709
>> NO, THEY'RE GOING TO GET TO

13:28.778 --> 13:29.010
SUPER BOWL.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.244
AT THE THEORY ISSUES ARE

13:30.313 --> 13:32.914
EVENTUALLY GOING TO GHOST HIM AT

13:32.983 --> 13:35.316
THAT POINT.

13:35.385 --> 13:37.251
>> AND GROSS ALL THE WAY TO THE

13:37.320 --> 13:37.552
WHITE HOUSE.

13:37.621 --> 13:42.190
THE PRESS SECRETARY SPOKE ABOUT

13:42.259 --> 13:44.358
THE POTENTIAL ROMANCE.

13:44.427 --> 13:46.160
>> IN THE BRACKET OF THE

13:46.229 --> 13:47.161
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL I

13:47.230 --> 13:50.565
COULD NOT CONFIRM OR THE REPORTS

13:50.634 --> 13:50.798
REPORTS.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.066
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]

13:52.135 --> 13:52.600
>> John: MOVING ON.

13:52.669 --> 13:53.234
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

13:53.303 --> 13:54.202
SCHOOL.

13:54.271 --> 13:54.869
FOR SOME, IT'S THE PLACE TO MAKE

13:54.938 --> 13:56.971
LIFELONG FRIENDS AND ENJOY FIRST

13:57.040 --> 13:57.972
CRUSHES, WHILE FOR OTHERS, AND

13:58.041 --> 13:59.507
I'M NOT NAMING NAMES, IT'S NOT.

13:59.576 --> 14:03.377
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

14:03.446 --> 14:04.779
TALK ABOUT HOMESCHOOLING.

14:04.848 --> 14:07.548
DURING THE PANDEMIC, MANY

14:07.617 --> 14:08.382
PARENTS WERE SUDDENLY FORCED TO

14:08.451 --> 14:09.417
DO IT, AND WHILE SOME STRUGGLED,

14:09.486 --> 14:10.618
OTHERS -- LIKE THIS FAMILY --

14:10.687 --> 14:13.321
ABSOLUTELY THRIVED.

14:13.390 --> 14:16.357
>> A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J,

14:16.426 --> 14:19.327
K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U,

14:19.396 --> 14:22.463
V, W, X, Y, Z.

14:22.532 --> 14:25.933
NOW YOU KNOW YOUR ABC'S.

14:26.002 --> 14:27.568
>> John: THAT'S CLEARLY

14:27.637 --> 14:30.872
EXCELLENT, BUT ALSO A PRETTY

14:30.941 --> 14:32.406
MEAN WAY TO MAKE OTHER PARENTS

14:32.475 --> 14:34.609
LOOK LIKE TOTAL SHIT.

14:34.678 --> 14:35.943
BECAUSE THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

14:36.012 --> 14:36.844
BETTER THAN ANYTHING I DID WITH

14:36.913 --> 14:38.546
MY KIDS DURING THE PANDEMIC.

14:38.615 --> 14:39.814
IT WAS MUCH LESS SINGING

14:39.883 --> 14:41.716
CERTIFIED ALPHABET BANGERS AND

14:41.785 --> 14:44.051
MUCH MORE "HIDING IN THE CLOSET,

14:44.120 --> 14:46.554
PRAYING THEY WOULDN'T FIND ME."

14:46.623 --> 14:47.155
ALSO, QUICK SHOUT OUT TO THE

14:47.224 --> 14:48.022
BABY ON THE COUNTER LIVING HER

14:48.091 --> 14:50.825
BEST LIFE.

14:50.894 --> 14:52.693
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON,

14:52.762 --> 14:54.061
BUT YET THERE SHE IS IN THE

14:54.130 --> 14:54.529
CENTER OF IT ALL LIKE

14:54.598 --> 14:55.363
MARIAH CAREY ON A NEW YEAR'S

14:55.432 --> 14:58.599
BROADCAST.

14:58.668 --> 14:59.433
NOW, THAT FAMILY -- LIKE MANY --

14:59.502 --> 15:00.635
EVENTUALLY SENT THEIR KIDS BACK

15:00.704 --> 15:02.370
TO SCHOOL.

15:02.439 --> 15:03.471
BUT FOR SOME, HOMESCHOOLING

15:03.540 --> 15:04.972
ISN'T JUST A PANDEMIC ERA

15:05.041 --> 15:06.474
NECESSITY, IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

15:06.543 --> 15:08.042
AND YOU MAY HAVE HEARD A

15:08.111 --> 15:09.677
STEREOTYPE OF HOMESCHOOLERS

15:09.746 --> 15:11.112
BEING CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

15:11.181 --> 15:12.747
WHO OBJECT TO WHAT KIDS LEARN IN

15:12.816 --> 15:14.215
PUBLIC SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS.

15:14.284 --> 15:14.782
AND I ADMIT, THOSE PEOPLE DO

15:14.851 --> 15:16.484
EXIST.

15:16.553 --> 15:18.219
TAKE THIS MAN, WHO OFFERS THIS

15:18.288 --> 15:19.587
PRETTY SHAKY RATIONALIZATION FOR

15:19.656 --> 15:22.523
PULLING HIS KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL.

15:22.592 --> 15:25.226
>> I THINK THE TYPE OF CONTENT

15:25.295 --> 15:26.227
ON WHAT THEY'RE TEACHING ABOUT

15:26.296 --> 15:28.362
SEX OR ANAL SEX.

15:28.431 --> 15:31.098
THAT MY THIRD-GRADE DAUGHTER

15:31.167 --> 15:31.666
SHOULD NOT BE IN A CLASSROOM

15:31.735 --> 15:34.268
WHERE A TEACHER OR SOMEONE ELSE

15:34.337 --> 15:35.236
IS TEACHING HER ABOUT THAT.

15:35.305 --> 15:36.070
>> AND THAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE

15:36.139 --> 15:36.337
IN SCHOOL?

15:36.406 --> 15:37.905
>> I THROUGH -- THROUGH FRIENDS

15:37.974 --> 15:42.810
IN OTHER SPOTS THAT HAD BEEN

15:42.879 --> 15:43.444
KIDS AT THOSE AGES BECAUSE MINE

15:43.513 --> 15:44.078
WAS ONLY IN FIRST GRADE WHEN WE

15:44.147 --> 15:47.548
PULLED THEM.

15:47.617 --> 15:48.182
>> John: WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

15:48.251 --> 15:48.549
TOTAL BULLSHIT.

15:48.618 --> 15:49.383
ALTHOUGH I GUESS I DO BASICALLY

15:49.452 --> 15:52.987
AGREE WITH HIM: THINGS THAT ARE

15:53.056 --> 15:53.654
DEFINITELY NOT HAPPENING, SHOULD

15:53.723 --> 15:55.056
CONTINUE NOT TO HAPPEN.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.491
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THE

15:56.560 --> 15:57.525
HOMESCHOOLING COMMUNITY IS MUCH

15:57.594 --> 15:59.794
BROADER THAN JUST RIGHT-ING

15:59.863 --> 16:01.429
PARENTS AFRAID OF HYPOTHETICAL

16:01.498 --> 16:03.598
3RD GRADE LUBE DEMONSTRATIONS.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.800
BY ONE ESTIMATE, THERE ARE NOW

16:05.869 --> 16:06.834
AROUND 2 MILLION CHILDREN BEING

16:06.903 --> 16:08.703
HOMESCHOOLED IN THIS COUNTRY,

16:08.772 --> 16:09.337
AND PARENTS CAN CHOOSE THAT FOR

16:09.406 --> 16:12.573
ALL SORTS OF REASONS.

16:12.642 --> 16:14.509
MAYBE THEIR KIDS HAVE SOCIAL OR

16:14.578 --> 16:15.243
HEALTH PROBLEMS, OR DISABILITIES

16:15.312 --> 16:17.044
THAT AREN'T BEING ACCOMMODATED.

16:17.113 --> 16:17.612
MAYBE THEY'RE FAMILIES WITH

16:17.681 --> 16:18.346
LEGITIMATE FEARS ABOUT SCHOOL

16:18.415 --> 16:19.447
SAFETY, OR WHO ARE IN THE

16:19.516 --> 16:21.582
MILITARY AND MOVE A LOT.

16:21.651 --> 16:22.483
AND THERE'S ALSO A GROWING

16:22.552 --> 16:24.285
NUMBER OF BLACK PARENTS OPTING

16:24.354 --> 16:25.353
TO HOME-SCHOOL DUE TO

16:25.422 --> 16:26.754
WHITE-WASHED CURRICULUMS AND

16:26.823 --> 16:28.289
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICIES IN

16:28.358 --> 16:29.590
SCHOOLS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY

16:29.659 --> 16:30.158
CRIMINALIZE THEIR KIDS AT AN

16:30.227 --> 16:30.825
EARLY AGE.

16:30.894 --> 16:32.126
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS TO

16:32.195 --> 16:34.395
DO IT.

16:34.464 --> 16:35.029
AND THE FACT IS, FOR SOME KIDS,

16:35.098 --> 16:35.630
GETTING TO BE HOMESCHOOLED CAN

16:35.699 --> 16:37.398
BE TRANSFORMATIVE.

16:37.467 --> 16:40.134
>> AT 15, VICTORIA ASKED HER MOM

16:40.203 --> 16:40.701
BERNITA TO TAKE HER OUT OF

16:40.770 --> 16:42.503
DETROIT SCHOOLS.

16:42.572 --> 16:43.371
SHE SAYS SHE WAS BEING BULLIED

16:43.440 --> 16:44.439
RELENTLESSLY FOR HER APPEARANCE

16:44.508 --> 16:47.308
AND IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HER

16:47.377 --> 16:49.577
ADMINISTRATORS CARED.

16:49.646 --> 16:51.145
>> IT MADE ME NOT WANT TO ASK

16:51.214 --> 16:53.247
QUESTIONS, YOU KNOW, OR NOT WANT

16:53.316 --> 16:54.081
TO ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

16:54.150 --> 17:00.488
BECAUSE I'M LIKE, OH, AM I

17:00.557 --> 17:01.456
LIKE -- THEY'RE GOING TO CALL ME

17:01.525 --> 17:01.656
DUMB.

17:01.725 --> 17:02.356
>> WHEN YOU TRANSITIONED TO

17:02.425 --> 17:02.990
HOMESCHOOLING, HOW DID YOU START

17:03.059 --> 17:03.491
TO FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF?

17:03.560 --> 17:04.725
>> I FELT MORE CONFIDENT.

17:04.794 --> 17:05.860
IT WAS JUST LIKE A KIND OF LIKE

17:05.929 --> 17:06.427
A SUNSHINE, LIKE THE CLOUDS

17:06.496 --> 17:07.195
OPENING A LITTLE BIT.

17:07.264 --> 17:11.732
>> John: THAT'S VERY NICE!

17:11.801 --> 17:12.266
AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT

17:12.335 --> 17:13.434
SOMETHING YOU USUALLY HEAR ME

17:13.503 --> 17:15.002
SAY AFTER A CLIP ON THIS SHOW.

17:15.071 --> 17:16.838
IT'S USUALLY A VARIATION OF

17:16.907 --> 17:17.371
"THAT'S HORRIBLE," "THAT'S

17:17.440 --> 17:18.573
HEARTBREAKING," OR "SHUT THE

17:18.642 --> 17:19.140
FUCK UP YOU BABY BITCH LAWN

17:19.209 --> 17:24.378
DART."

17:24.447 --> 17:24.846
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:24.915 --> 17:25.446
SO FRANKLY, THIS IS A WELCOME

17:25.515 --> 17:26.214
CHANGE OF PACE.

17:26.283 --> 17:26.848
THE POINT IS, THE CEILING OF HOW

17:26.917 --> 17:29.083
GOOD HOMESCHOOLING CAN BE IS

17:29.152 --> 17:30.585
ADMITTEDLY VERY HIGH.

17:30.654 --> 17:33.020
BUT THE FLOOR OF HOW BAD IT CAN

17:33.089 --> 17:35.790
GET IS BASICALLY NONEXISTENT.

17:35.859 --> 17:37.158
BECAUSE TO AN EXTENT YOU MAY NOT

17:37.227 --> 17:37.758
REALIZE, IN MANY PARTS OF THE

17:37.827 --> 17:38.860
COUNTRY, HOMESCHOOLING IS

17:38.929 --> 17:40.628
ESSENTIALLY UNREGULATED.

17:40.697 --> 17:42.430
WHICH CAN RESULT IN ENORMOUS

17:42.499 --> 17:43.197
DAMAGE.

17:43.266 --> 17:43.798
SO GIVEN THAT, TONIGHT, LET'S

17:43.867 --> 17:46.768
TAKE A LOOK AT HOMESCHOOLING.

17:46.837 --> 17:47.368
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

17:47.437 --> 17:48.069
THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW

17:48.138 --> 17:49.203
ABOUT HOMESCHOOLED KIDS -- FROM

17:49.272 --> 17:50.371
EXACTLY HOW MANY THERE ARE, TO

17:50.440 --> 17:51.806
WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.142
WHEN I SAID, "THERE ARE AROUND 2

17:54.211 --> 17:54.709
MILLION" OF THEM, THE REASON

17:54.778 --> 17:55.643
THAT'S AN ESTIMATE IS THAT,

17:55.712 --> 17:56.844
DEPENDING ON THE STATE,

17:56.913 --> 17:58.513
HOMESCHOOL FAMILIES MIGHT NOT

17:58.582 --> 17:59.847
HAVE TO REPORT WHAT THEY'RE

17:59.916 --> 18:00.815
DOING AT ALL.

18:00.884 --> 18:02.183
IN THESE 26 STATES, PARENTS

18:02.252 --> 18:03.951
SIMPLY HAVE TO FILE A NOTICE

18:04.020 --> 18:05.052
ONCE A YEAR WITH OFFICIALS TO

18:05.121 --> 18:06.154
LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE

18:06.223 --> 18:07.655
HOMESCHOOLING THEIR CHILD.

18:07.724 --> 18:08.589
IN THESE THIRTEEN, THEY ONLY

18:08.658 --> 18:09.223
HAVE TO FILE A NOTICE ONCE, WITH

18:09.292 --> 18:10.558
NO REQUIREMENT TO EVER CHECK IN

18:10.627 --> 18:17.627
AGAIN.

18:19.035 --> 18:19.567
AND IN THE REMAINING 11, THEY

18:19.636 --> 18:20.134
DON'T HAVE TO NOTIFY ANYONE

18:20.203 --> 18:20.368
AT ALL.

18:20.437 --> 18:20.868
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE

18:20.937 --> 18:21.402
EDUCATION ITSELF, FILING A

18:21.471 --> 18:22.136
NOTICE IS TYPICALLY WHERE

18:22.205 --> 18:22.904
SUPERVISION STOPS, AS IN MOST

18:22.973 --> 18:27.575
STATES, THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT,

18:27.644 --> 18:28.209
AND NO EVALUATION BY ANYONE OF

18:28.278 --> 18:28.776
THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM AND OF

18:28.845 --> 18:30.445
STUDENTS' PROGRESS.

18:30.514 --> 18:31.078
AND HOMESCHOOLING ADVOCATES WILL

18:31.147 --> 18:32.647
TELL YOU THAT'S NOT A CONCERN,

18:32.716 --> 18:33.214
AND THAT PARENTS WILL SIMPLY

18:33.283 --> 18:34.849
COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF

18:34.918 --> 18:36.050
INNOVATIVE WAYS TO TEACH THEIR

18:36.119 --> 18:37.585
KIDS.

18:37.654 --> 18:38.319
HERE'S ONE PARENT

18:38.388 --> 18:39.921
ENTHUSIASTICALLY EXPLAINING HOW

18:39.990 --> 18:41.923
HE TAUGHT HIS KIDS SCIENCE.

18:41.992 --> 18:42.757
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY

18:42.826 --> 18:44.926
TIMES, YOU KNOW, IN MY HOME, AT

18:44.995 --> 18:46.727
OUR KITCHEN TABLE WE'VE

18:46.796 --> 18:47.562
DISSECTED, YOU KNOW, SHEEP

18:47.631 --> 18:51.966
EYEBALLS OR FROGS.

18:52.035 --> 18:53.601
KITCHEN -- KITCHEN'S ARE GREAT

18:53.670 --> 18:54.168
LABS FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

18:54.237 --> 18:54.535
>> WHERE DOES --

18:54.604 --> 18:55.303
>> SO, THEY'LL GET TOGETHER --

18:55.372 --> 18:56.604
>> WHERE DOES SOMEBODY GET A

18:56.673 --> 18:56.938
SHEEP EYEBALL?

18:57.007 --> 18:59.173
>> [LAUGHS]

18:59.242 --> 19:00.141
WELL, JOHN, YOU CAN JUST

19:00.210 --> 19:00.641
GOOGLE SHEEP EYEBALL FOR

19:00.710 --> 19:01.342
HOMESCHOOLERS.

19:01.411 --> 19:01.809
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:01.878 --> 19:02.643
>> 'CAUSE LOTS OF PEOPLE --

19:02.712 --> 19:04.479
ABSOLUTELY.

19:04.548 --> 19:06.714
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, ARE

19:06.783 --> 19:07.448
KITCHENS THE BEST LAB FOR THIS

19:07.517 --> 19:09.817
KIND OF THING?

19:09.886 --> 19:11.085
I THINK PROBABLY LABS ARE THE

19:11.154 --> 19:13.020
BEST LAB FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

19:13.089 --> 19:13.788
I'M JUST SAYING -- MAYBE DON'T

19:13.857 --> 19:15.323
GO DISSECTING SHEEP EYEBALLS IN

19:15.392 --> 19:16.591
THE SAME PLACE WHERE YOU CUT

19:16.660 --> 19:18.126
OLIVES FOR SALAD.

19:18.195 --> 19:18.659
ALSO, DO NOT GOOGLE SHEEP

19:18.728 --> 19:20.661
EYEBALLS.

19:20.730 --> 19:26.000
I DID, AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO

19:26.069 --> 19:27.101
SHOW YOU THE RESULT UNBLURRED,

19:27.170 --> 19:29.470
BECAUSE IT'S TOO NAUSEATING.

19:29.539 --> 19:30.571
SUFFICE TO SAY, IT LOOKS LIKE

19:30.640 --> 19:32.106
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AN OYSTER

19:32.175 --> 19:33.841
HAD A BUTTHOLE.

19:33.910 --> 19:34.876
BUT WHILE THAT MAN WAS CLEARLY

19:34.945 --> 19:36.744
WILLING TO GO TO IMPRESSIVE

19:36.813 --> 19:38.179
LENGTHS FOR AT-HOME SCIENCE

19:38.248 --> 19:39.380
LESSONS, NOT EVERYONE HAS THE

19:39.449 --> 19:42.984
TIME OR THE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP

19:43.053 --> 19:43.918
A CURRICULUM FROM SCRATCH.

19:43.987 --> 19:45.453
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE BIG

19:45.522 --> 19:46.888
PUBLISHERS WHO OFFER MATERIALS

19:46.957 --> 19:47.688
SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO

19:47.757 --> 19:49.390
HOMESCHOOLERS.

19:49.459 --> 19:51.092
MUCH OF THAT MARKET IS DOMINATED

19:51.161 --> 19:52.693
BY THESE THREE CHRISTIAN

19:52.762 --> 19:55.163
TEXTBOOK PUBLISHERS WHO PROMISE

19:55.232 --> 19:55.730
LEARNING THROUGH A BIBLICAL

19:55.799 --> 19:57.932
FILTER.

19:58.001 --> 19:58.866
AND LOOK, IT IS ABSOLUTELY A

19:58.935 --> 20:00.434
PARENT'S RIGHT TO EDUCATE THEIR

20:00.503 --> 20:01.068
CHILD WITH RELIGION IF THEY SO

20:01.137 --> 20:02.770
CHOOSE.

20:02.839 --> 20:04.238
BUT THE QUALITY OF SOME OF THESE

20:04.307 --> 20:06.441
BOOKS CAN BE TROUBLING.

20:06.510 --> 20:09.844
FOR INSTANCE, ONE CURRENT ABEKA

20:09.913 --> 20:10.411
HISTORY BOOK SAYS THAT "THE

20:10.480 --> 20:11.012
BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY

20:11.081 --> 20:12.647
WITNESSED A CULTURAL BREAKDOWN

20:12.716 --> 20:13.247
THAT THREATENED TO DESTROY THE

20:13.316 --> 20:13.714
VERY ROOTS OF WESTERN

20:13.783 --> 20:14.549
CIVILIZATION.

20:14.618 --> 20:17.084
THE CAUSE OF THIS DISSOLUTION

20:17.153 --> 20:17.819
WAS AN IDEA OR PHILOSOPHY KNOWN

20:17.888 --> 20:19.987
AS LIBERALISM."

20:20.056 --> 20:21.756
MEANWHILE, A WORKBOOK FROM ACE

20:21.825 --> 20:23.391
CELEBRATES THE CONFEDERATE

20:23.460 --> 20:24.125
GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE AS "A

20:24.194 --> 20:26.260
DEVOTED CHRISTIAN WHO PRACTICED

20:26.329 --> 20:27.328
HIS CHRISTIANITY IN ALL HIS

20:27.397 --> 20:29.597
DEALINGS WITH OTHERS."

20:29.666 --> 20:30.665
AND A SCIENCE BOOK FROM

20:30.734 --> 20:32.033
BOB JONES UNIVERSITY CLAIMS

20:32.102 --> 20:34.235
THAT, "BIBLICAL AND SCIENTIFIC

20:34.304 --> 20:34.969
EVIDENCE TENDS TO SUPPORT THE

20:35.038 --> 20:35.736
IDEA THAT MEN AND DINOSAURS

20:35.805 --> 20:38.706
EXISTED AT THE SAME TIME."

20:38.775 --> 20:39.740
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT

20:39.809 --> 20:41.876
THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE, ACE HAD A

20:41.945 --> 20:42.910
WORKBOOK FEATURING THIS

20:42.979 --> 20:45.480
RENDERING -- IMPLYING THAT NOT

20:45.549 --> 20:47.682
ONLY DID MEN AND DINOSAURS EXIST

20:47.751 --> 20:48.449
AT THE SAME TIME, BUT THEY WERE

20:48.518 --> 20:49.016
BOTH TOTALLY COOL WITH EACH

20:49.085 --> 20:51.018
OTHER.

20:51.087 --> 20:51.986
"HEY HANK, GREAT TUCKED IN

20:52.055 --> 20:53.754
SHIRT!

20:53.823 --> 20:54.355
DO YOU SEE THAT DINOSAUR OVER

20:54.424 --> 20:55.223
THERE?"

20:55.292 --> 20:56.557
"SURE DO BOB, LOVE THOSE JEANS,

20:56.626 --> 20:56.858
BY THE WAY.

20:56.927 --> 20:57.992
SHOULD WE RUN?"

20:58.061 --> 20:59.994
"NO WAY, THE DINOS ARE CHILL,

21:00.063 --> 21:01.028
LET'S JUST KEEP WACKING THESE

21:01.097 --> 21:01.662
LEAVES WITH THAT ONE SWORD KNIFE

21:01.731 --> 21:06.234
YOU BROUGHT."

21:06.303 --> 21:06.868
BUT WHILE ALL OF THAT IS PRETTY

21:06.937 --> 21:07.502
TROUBLING, THE TRUTH IS, IN MANY

21:07.571 --> 21:13.508
STATES PARENTS DON'T ULTIMATELY

21:13.577 --> 21:14.308
HAVE TO TEACH THEIR KIDS

21:14.377 --> 21:15.910
ANYTHING AT ALL.

21:15.979 --> 21:17.478
JUST WATCH AS THIS FORMER

21:17.547 --> 21:18.079
HOMESCHOOL STUDENT BREAKS DOWN

21:18.148 --> 21:19.814
HER DAILY SCHEDULE.

21:19.883 --> 21:20.948
>> THIS IS MY ACTUAL LIST OF

21:21.017 --> 21:23.484
ASSIGNMENTS.

21:23.553 --> 21:24.819
WE'VE GOT THE DATE AT THE TOP.

21:24.888 --> 21:26.387
I WOULD HAVE BEEN 12.

21:26.456 --> 21:27.522
FIRST, WE'VE GOT CLASSICAL MUSIC

21:27.591 --> 21:29.590
WHICH WAS JUST TURNING ON

21:29.659 --> 21:30.691
CLASSICAL MUSIC IN THE MORNING

21:30.760 --> 21:32.026
SO THAT EVERYONE COULD HEAR IT.

21:32.095 --> 21:34.228
WE'VE GOT BIBLE LISTENING.

21:34.297 --> 21:35.363
WE'VE GOT HANDWRITING AND MATH.

21:35.432 --> 21:36.964
THAT'S FAIRLY NORMAL.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.499
WE'VE GOT MEMORIZING THE BIBLE.

21:38.568 --> 21:39.066
MMM.

21:39.135 --> 21:40.802
WE'VE GOT MEMORIZING POETRY.

21:40.871 --> 21:43.905
THE POETRY WAS MOSTLY HYMNS.

21:43.974 --> 21:44.338
WE'VE GOT EXERCISE.

21:44.407 --> 21:45.573
THAT'S GOOD.

21:45.642 --> 21:46.407
IT WAS USUALLY JUST WALKING

21:46.476 --> 21:48.342
AROUND THE BLOCK.

21:48.411 --> 21:52.680
AND THEN THE WHOLE ENTIRE REST

21:52.749 --> 21:54.282
OF THE LIST IS CHORES AND

21:54.351 --> 22:00.054
CLEANING TASKS.

22:00.123 --> 22:00.488
>> John: IT'S TRUE!

22:00.557 --> 22:00.988
MOST OF HER LESSONS JUST

22:01.057 --> 22:01.355
INVOLVED CHORES.

22:01.424 --> 22:02.857
AND LOOK AT THAT LIST!

22:02.926 --> 22:03.391
THAT IS A LOT OF CLEANING

22:03.460 --> 22:04.559
DEMANDS!

22:04.628 --> 22:05.293
WHO WAS HER PARENT?

22:05.362 --> 22:07.562
THIS GUY?

22:07.631 --> 22:09.130
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG, HE'S

22:09.199 --> 22:10.731
AN ABSOLUTE ZADDY.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.233
WOULD, WILL, AND I'LL TAKE

22:12.302 --> 22:13.434
SECONDS.

22:13.503 --> 22:15.236
BUT AS HOT AS HE MAKES "DOING

22:15.305 --> 22:16.437
CHORES" SEEM, IT'S NOT AN

22:16.506 --> 22:17.171
ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE TO

22:17.240 --> 22:18.706
EDUCATION.

22:18.775 --> 22:22.243
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, EVEN THAT

22:22.312 --> 22:24.479
IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO

22:24.548 --> 22:25.213
THE SINGLE WORST HOMESCHOOL

22:25.282 --> 22:26.481
CURRICULUM WE FOUND, WHOSE

22:26.550 --> 22:28.449
CREATORS EXCITEDLY PROMOTED IT

22:28.518 --> 22:29.817
ON A PODCAST.

22:29.886 --> 22:33.721
>> WE ARE SO DEEPLY INVESTED

22:33.790 --> 22:36.924
INTO MAKING SURE THAT THAT CHILD

22:36.993 --> 22:39.660
BECOMES A WONDERFUL NAZI, AND BY

22:39.729 --> 22:40.761
HOME-SCHOOLING WE'RE GOING TO

22:40.830 --> 22:42.029
GET THAT DONE.

22:42.098 --> 22:42.663
>> John: WELL, THAT'S

22:42.732 --> 22:45.199
TERRIFYING!

22:45.268 --> 22:46.567
YOU NEVER WANT TO HEAR A MOTHER

22:46.636 --> 22:49.203
LOVINGLY UTTER THE SENTENCE "MY

22:49.272 --> 22:50.204
KID'S A WONDERFUL NAZI," OUTSIDE

22:50.273 --> 22:52.273
OF MAYBE IF THEY'RE PRAISING

22:52.342 --> 22:54.742
THEIR SON'S PERFORMANCE AS ROLF

22:54.811 --> 22:55.710
IN "THE SOUND OF MUSIC."

22:55.779 --> 22:56.210
AND EVEN THEN, JUST SAY

22:56.279 --> 22:57.645
"WONDERFUL ROLF."

22:57.714 --> 23:02.383
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

23:02.452 --> 23:03.417
THAT WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND

23:03.486 --> 23:04.652
ACTUALLY LAUNCHED THEIR OWN

23:04.721 --> 23:05.820
ONLINE COMMUNITY, DISSIDENT

23:05.889 --> 23:07.588
HOMESCHOOL, IN 2021, AFTER SHE

23:07.657 --> 23:09.323
HAD A QUOTE "ROUGH TIME FINDING

23:09.392 --> 23:10.958
NAZI-APPROVED SCHOOL MATERIAL

23:11.027 --> 23:12.593
FOR HER HOMESCHOOL CHILDREN."

23:12.662 --> 23:13.194
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:13.263 --> 23:15.463
GOOD!

23:15.532 --> 23:16.764
THAT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE AN

23:16.833 --> 23:19.267
EASY GOOGLE.

23:19.336 --> 23:21.202
IN FACT, IF YOU SEARCH FOR THAT,

23:21.271 --> 23:22.737
IT SHOULD PROBABLY AUTOCORRECT

23:22.806 --> 23:24.305
TO "DID YOU MEAN, HOW DO I TAKE

23:24.374 --> 23:26.541
MYSELF TO JAIL?"

23:26.610 --> 23:28.242
AT ONE POINT, DISSIDENT

23:28.311 --> 23:30.344
HOMESCHOOL HAD NEARLY 2500

23:30.413 --> 23:31.312
SUBSCRIBERS AND INCLUDED IDEAS

23:31.381 --> 23:32.980
LIKE HANDWRITING EXERCISES

23:33.049 --> 23:34.682
CONSISTING OF WRITING OUT QUOTES

23:34.751 --> 23:35.917
FROM ADOLF HITLER.

23:35.986 --> 23:36.517
WHICH I THINK WE CAN AGREE IS

23:36.586 --> 23:38.886
APPALLING.

23:38.955 --> 23:43.925
HANDWRITING EXERCISES?

23:43.994 --> 23:44.559
THAT IS JUST CRUEL.

23:44.628 --> 23:45.193
THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON THEIR

23:45.262 --> 23:45.793
KEYBOARD SKILLS, THROUGH GAMES

23:45.862 --> 23:46.828
LIKE "MAVIS BEACON TEACHES THE

23:46.897 --> 23:53.897
FINAL SOLUTION."

23:54.671 --> 23:55.169
NOT THAT, DON'T ACTUALLY DO

23:55.238 --> 23:56.671
THAT.

23:56.740 --> 23:57.271
THAT IS AWFUL.

23:57.340 --> 23:57.839
THE CHANNEL ALSO POSTED TIPS

23:57.908 --> 23:58.473
ENSURING THAT THEIR PARENTS WERE

23:58.542 --> 23:59.040
IN "FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE

23:59.109 --> 23:59.540
LAW" SO THAT "THE STATE"

23:59.609 --> 24:00.541
WOULDN'T INTERFERE.

24:00.610 --> 24:01.776
BUT AS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN, IN

24:01.845 --> 24:02.944
MOST STATES, THEY DON'T HAVE

24:03.013 --> 24:04.545
MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT THERE,

24:04.614 --> 24:06.247
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO

24:06.316 --> 24:06.881
HOMESCHOOLING, BASICALLY,

24:06.950 --> 24:09.917
ANYTHING GOES.

24:09.986 --> 24:10.852
SO, HOW THE FUCK IS THAT THE

24:10.921 --> 24:11.819
CASE?

24:11.888 --> 24:12.620
WELL, IN LARGE PART, IT'S THANKS

24:12.689 --> 24:14.555
TO A VERY POWERFUL HOMESCHOOLING

24:14.624 --> 24:15.556
LOBBY, WHOSE MOST PROMINENT

24:15.625 --> 24:20.862
PLAYER IS THE HOME SCHOOL LEGAL

24:20.931 --> 24:21.462
DEFENSE ASSOCIATION, OR HSLDA.

24:21.531 --> 24:22.930
AND HERE IS WHERE I'LL CONCEDE

24:22.999 --> 24:25.466
SOME GROUND, IT GREW OUT OF AN

24:25.535 --> 24:26.868
ENVIRONMENT THAT "WAS," IN MANY

24:26.937 --> 24:28.169
PLACES, OVERLY RESTRICTIVE OF

24:28.238 --> 24:29.771
HOMESCHOOLING, WITH SOME STATES

24:29.840 --> 24:30.772
AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

24:30.841 --> 24:33.941
EFFECTIVELY BANNING IT ENTIRELY.

24:34.010 --> 24:34.809
IN TEXAS IN THE EARLY 1980'S,

24:34.878 --> 24:36.644
HOMESCHOOLING FAMILIES WERE

24:36.713 --> 24:37.845
ACTUALLY PROSECUTED.

24:37.914 --> 24:39.247
BUT A TURNING POINT CAME AFTER

24:39.316 --> 24:40.648
SEVERAL TEXAS FAMILIES FILED A

24:40.717 --> 24:42.183
CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THEIR

24:42.252 --> 24:42.850
SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND ULTIMATELY

24:42.919 --> 24:44.118
WON.

24:44.187 --> 24:46.420
AROUND THE SAME TIME, THE HSLDA

24:46.489 --> 24:48.122
WAS FORMED, WITH THE AIM OF

24:48.191 --> 24:49.423
EXPANDING THE RIGHTS OF

24:49.492 --> 24:54.495
HOMESCHOOLERS IN EVERY STATE.

24:54.564 --> 24:55.763
AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

24:55.832 --> 24:56.864
IT'S HAD A STRONG EVANGELICAL,

24:56.933 --> 24:57.632
CONSERVATIVE OUTLOOK.

24:57.701 --> 24:58.866
ITS FOUNDING PRESIDENT AND

24:58.935 --> 25:00.234
CHAIRMAN, MICHAEL FARRIS, HAS

25:00.303 --> 25:00.868
REFERRED TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS A

25:00.937 --> 25:03.571
"GODLESS MONSTROSITY."

25:03.640 --> 25:04.939
AND HERE HE IS BACK IN 2004,

25:05.008 --> 25:05.940
SPEAKING TO THE CHRISTIAN

25:06.009 --> 25:07.542
COALITION, AND DESCRIBING HIS

25:07.611 --> 25:08.109
LONG-TERM HOPES FOR THE NEXT

25:08.178 --> 25:09.944
GENERATION.

25:10.013 --> 25:11.145
>> TODAY, IT IS NOT PREPOSTEROUS

25:11.214 --> 25:12.647
TO RECOGNIZE WHAT'S GOING ON --

25:12.716 --> 25:14.148
THE PROMOTION OF HOMOSEXUALITY,

25:14.217 --> 25:16.317
THE PROMOTION OF OTHER KINDS OF

25:16.386 --> 25:17.819
THINGS THAT YOU HEARD FROM

25:17.888 --> 25:19.320
WALTER JONES, YOU'VE HEARD MANY

25:19.389 --> 25:20.888
OTHER TIMES, IS A DEPLORABLE

25:20.957 --> 25:21.355
REALITY THAT WE CANNOT

25:21.424 --> 25:24.826
COUNTENANCE.

25:24.895 --> 25:26.060
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DAY WHEN

25:26.129 --> 25:30.231
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE VANQUISH THE

25:30.300 --> 25:30.832
ENEMY BY A 5-4 VOTE REVERSING

25:30.901 --> 25:37.901
ROE V. WADE.

25:41.845 --> 25:42.777
WHERE WE VANQUISH THE SPECTER OF

25:42.846 --> 25:44.545
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

25:44.614 --> 25:51.614
THAT'S THE STANDARD OF VICTORY.

25:51.788 --> 25:52.954
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT

25:53.023 --> 25:54.622
THAT'S HARD TO TAKE IN THAT CLIP

25:54.691 --> 25:55.223
-- THAT THAT'S HIS WISH LIST,

25:55.292 --> 25:56.324
THAT HE'S ALREADY GOTTEN HALF OF

25:56.393 --> 25:57.492
IT, AND THAT HE'S SAYING

25:57.561 --> 25:59.360
"VANQUISH THE ENEMY," DESPITE

25:59.429 --> 26:00.294
LOOKING LESS LIKE A WARRIOR AND

26:00.363 --> 26:01.028
MORE LIKE YOUR TAX ACCOUNTANT'S

26:01.097 --> 26:01.963
TAX ACCOUNTANT'S ASSISTANT.

26:02.032 --> 26:02.563
OVER THE YEARS, THE HSLDA HAS

26:02.632 --> 26:03.131
LOBBIED EXTENSIVELY, FROM A

26:03.200 --> 26:04.499
HARD-RIGHT PERSPECTIVE, ON

26:04.568 --> 26:06.501
ISSUES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO

26:06.570 --> 26:08.002
WITH HOMESCHOOLING, OPPOSING

26:08.071 --> 26:09.470
EVERYTHING FROM VACCINE MANDATES

26:09.539 --> 26:15.576
TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

26:15.645 --> 26:16.344
BUT IT SPEAKS TO HOW SIGNIFICANT

26:16.413 --> 26:16.944
A FORCE IT IS THAT EVEN SOME

26:17.013 --> 26:17.578
PARENTS WHO ARE UNEASY WITH ITS

26:17.647 --> 26:18.312
POLITICAL LEANINGS, FEEL THEY

26:18.381 --> 26:18.813
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BE

26:18.882 --> 26:20.114
MEMBERS.

26:20.183 --> 26:21.249
HERE'S ONE MOM, WHO STARTED A

26:21.318 --> 26:22.483
HOMESCHOOLING GROUP TO OFFER AN

26:22.552 --> 26:24.519
ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT SHE SAW AS A

26:24.588 --> 26:26.087
WHITEWASHED CURRICULUM, TALKING

26:26.156 --> 26:26.687
ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP TO THE

26:26.756 --> 26:28.055
HSLDA.

26:28.124 --> 26:30.258
>> WHENEVER THERE'S A THREAT IN

26:30.327 --> 26:31.459
ANY PARTICULAR STATE TO THEIR

26:31.528 --> 26:33.027
RIGHT TO HOMESCHOOL, OH, YOU

26:33.096 --> 26:34.896
WILL SEE US COME TOGETHER.

26:34.965 --> 26:36.664
YOU KNOW, IT MAY NOT -- WE'RE

26:36.733 --> 26:37.298
NOT GOING TO STAY TOGETHER, BUT

26:37.367 --> 26:38.466
WE WILL BAND UP BECAUSE WE ALL

26:38.535 --> 26:41.235
DESPERATELY NEED OUR RIGHT TO

26:41.304 --> 26:43.871
HOMESCHOOL.

26:43.940 --> 26:45.306
AND THAT'S THE NUANCED ASPECT OF

26:45.375 --> 26:46.674
BEING IN HOMESCHOOL WORLD.

26:46.743 --> 26:48.376
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK

26:48.445 --> 26:51.179
WITH IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN WHAT

26:51.248 --> 26:55.483
YOU HOLD DEAR ARE ALSO THE

26:55.552 --> 26:56.751
PEOPLE WHO CRUSH YOU.

26:56.820 --> 26:58.453
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

26:58.522 --> 26:59.654
THE HSLDA HAVE MADE THEMSELVES

26:59.723 --> 27:01.122
SO POWERFUL, MANY PARENTS KEEP

27:01.191 --> 27:02.490
WORKING WITH THEM EVEN IF THEY

27:02.559 --> 27:03.558
DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THEY

27:03.627 --> 27:04.959
STAND FOR.

27:05.028 --> 27:06.394
IT'S A DILEMMA OTHERWISE KNOWN

27:06.463 --> 27:10.164
AS "THE TOM CRUISE CONUNDRUM."

27:10.233 --> 27:10.698
ON THE ONE HAND, A BILLION

27:10.767 --> 27:11.566
DOLLARS IN THE BOX OFFICE.

27:11.635 --> 27:12.900
ON THE OTHER, A BILLION YEAR

27:12.969 --> 27:14.268
CONTRACT TO AN ALIEN MAFIA.

27:14.337 --> 27:18.072
IT'S TRICKY, RIGHT?

27:18.141 --> 27:18.706
IT'S TRICKY.

27:18.775 --> 27:19.340
WHAT'S A BUNCH OF YOUNG HOTS TO

27:19.409 --> 27:20.208
DO?

27:20.277 --> 27:20.808
PLUS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE

27:20.877 --> 27:22.110
HSLDA -- MUCH LIKE TOM CRUISE --

27:22.179 --> 27:24.712
WILL PROBABLY NEVER DIE.

27:24.781 --> 27:25.980
AS A LOBBYING GROUP, IT'S BEEN

27:26.049 --> 27:27.515
ASTONISHINGLY SUCCESSFUL.

27:27.584 --> 27:28.616
IN FOUR DECADES, ITS EFFORTS

27:28.685 --> 27:29.951
HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH ROLLING

27:30.020 --> 27:31.319
BACK EXISTING LAWS GOVERNING

27:31.388 --> 27:32.987
HOMESCHOOLING IN STATE AFTER

27:33.056 --> 27:34.155
STATE.

27:34.224 --> 27:35.656
AND THE ARGUMENT IT WILL ALWAYS

27:35.725 --> 27:37.558
MAKE AGAINST ANY REGULATION IS,

27:37.627 --> 27:38.693
"YOU'RE JUST PUNISHING ALL THE

27:38.762 --> 27:41.362
PARENTS DOING THINGS RIGHT, TO

27:41.431 --> 27:41.996
ADDRESS A HANDFUL WHO ARE DOING

27:42.065 --> 27:44.699
IT WRONG."

27:44.768 --> 27:45.133
AND IN THEORY, SURE.

27:45.202 --> 27:45.766
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOME PARENTS

27:45.835 --> 27:47.335
RUNNING THE HOMESCHOOL INSTITUTE

27:47.404 --> 27:48.903
OF DISHWASHING, AND OTHERS

27:48.972 --> 27:50.638
RUNNING LIL NAZIS 'R' US, IT

27:50.707 --> 27:52.106
SEEMS MAYBE THE REINS HAVE

27:52.175 --> 27:54.642
GOTTEN A LITTLE LOOSE.

27:54.711 --> 27:55.576
AND THE LACK OF REGULATION HERE

27:55.645 --> 27:57.145
HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES, AND

27:57.214 --> 27:58.846
NOT JUST REGARDING QUALITY OF

27:58.915 --> 28:00.414
EDUCATION.

28:00.483 --> 28:02.717
AND FAIR WARNING, THIS IS WHERE

28:02.786 --> 28:03.518
THE STORY GETS QUITE A BIT

28:03.587 --> 28:04.886
DARKER.

28:04.955 --> 28:05.920
>> MORE THAN TWO MILLION

28:05.989 --> 28:06.554
CHILDREN ARE BEING HOMESCHOOLED

28:06.623 --> 28:08.055
IN THE U.S.

28:08.124 --> 28:09.690
MANY OF THEM LIVING IN STATES

28:09.759 --> 28:12.026
THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NO

28:12.095 --> 28:13.828
REGULATIONS, MAKING IT EASY FOR

28:13.897 --> 28:14.562
ABUSIVE PARENTS TO HIDE BEHIND

28:14.631 --> 28:16.297
THE SYSTEM.

28:16.366 --> 28:17.999
THESE ARE THE FACES OF JUST SOME

28:18.068 --> 28:20.334
OF THE HOMESCHOOL CHILDREN THAT

28:20.403 --> 28:22.036
HAVE DIED OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT

28:22.105 --> 28:22.670
SUSANNA GRUBBS WAS HOMESCHOOLED

28:22.739 --> 28:23.571
IN MISSOURI.

28:23.640 --> 28:24.572
SHE TELLS US, THE DISCIPLINE SHE

28:24.641 --> 28:25.106
RECEIVED WAS ANYTHING BUT

28:25.175 --> 28:29.310
GENTLE.

28:29.379 --> 28:29.877
>> I THINK THAT, IN A LOT OF

28:29.946 --> 28:30.778
WAYS, ME AND MY SIBLINGS TOTALLY

28:30.847 --> 28:31.279
FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

28:31.348 --> 28:33.614
BECAUSE, I MEAN, WITH MY MOM'S

28:33.683 --> 28:34.882
DISCIPLINARY TECHNIQUES, AND MY

28:34.951 --> 28:36.651
MOM'S EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT.

28:36.720 --> 28:37.652
IT'S REALLY TERRIBLE THAT IT --

28:37.721 --> 28:38.219
IT HAS HAPPENED AND IT KEEPS

28:38.288 --> 28:39.720
HAPPENING.

28:39.789 --> 28:40.888
AND NOBODY WANTS TO STOP IT

28:40.957 --> 28:43.024
BECAUSE PARENTAL RIGHTS ARE SO

28:43.093 --> 28:43.624
PARAMOUNT TO ANYTHING ELSE IN

28:43.693 --> 28:45.293
THIS COUNTRY.

28:45.362 --> 28:46.461
>> John: EXACTLY.

28:46.530 --> 28:47.895
AND THAT'S MASSIVELY DANGEROUS.

28:47.964 --> 28:48.629
BECAUSE DEREGULATING

28:48.698 --> 28:50.832
HOMESCHOOLING DOESN'T JUST

28:50.901 --> 28:52.333
ELIMINATE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST

28:52.402 --> 28:53.701
PARENTS WHO ARE BAD TEACHERS, IT

28:53.770 --> 28:54.902
ALSO ELIMINATES THEM AGAINST

28:54.971 --> 28:57.638
PARENTS WHO ARE BAD PEOPLE.

28:57.707 --> 28:58.339
FOR ALL THE HSLDA'S TALK OF

28:58.408 --> 28:59.574
"PARENTAL RIGHTS," IT'S WORTH

28:59.643 --> 29:00.875
REMEMBERING: ELON MUSK IS A

29:00.944 --> 29:02.076
PARENT.

29:02.145 --> 29:03.978
OJ SIMPSON IS A PARENT.

29:04.047 --> 29:06.581
DARTH VADER IS SUCH A PARENT HE

29:06.650 --> 29:08.049
MADE IT PART OF HIS FANCY NAME

29:08.118 --> 29:08.850
CHANGE.

29:08.919 --> 29:09.884
THE POINT IS, HAVING A CHILD

29:09.953 --> 29:11.419
DOES NOT INHERENTLY MAKE YOU

29:11.488 --> 29:12.687
VIRTUOUS.

29:12.756 --> 29:15.223
AND ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS HERE

29:15.292 --> 29:16.691
IS, CHILD WELFARE LAWS WERE

29:16.760 --> 29:18.993
WRITTEN BEFORE HOMESCHOOLING WAS

29:19.062 --> 29:20.795
LEGAL IN ALL FIFTY STATES.

29:20.864 --> 29:22.897
SO THEY RELY HEAVILY ON THE

29:22.966 --> 29:24.665
PREMISE THAT A CHILD IS GOING TO

29:24.734 --> 29:26.601
BE IN SCHOOL AND SEEN BY OTHER

29:26.670 --> 29:28.836
ADULTS, AS THIS DA EXPLAINS.

29:28.905 --> 29:30.505
>> A LOT OF CHILD ABUSE GETS

29:30.574 --> 29:32.140
REPORTED THROUGH OUR SCHOOLS.

29:32.209 --> 29:34.308
TEACHERS AND SCHOOL

29:34.377 --> 29:34.876
ADMINISTRATORS ARE MANDATED

29:34.945 --> 29:36.244
REPORTERS.

29:36.313 --> 29:37.712
SO, YOU KNOW, IF A CHILD COMES

29:37.781 --> 29:39.447
TO SCHOOL WITH BRUISES OR

29:39.516 --> 29:41.449
EMACIATED, THAT IS A VERY COMMON

29:41.518 --> 29:42.517
WAY THAT IT GETS REPORTED.

29:42.586 --> 29:43.818
>> John: RIGHT.

29:43.887 --> 29:45.953
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, TEACHERS

29:46.022 --> 29:46.754
SERVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS AT

29:46.823 --> 29:48.356
SCHOOL IN ADDITION TO EDUCATION.

29:48.425 --> 29:49.690
THEY WATCH OUT FOR SIGNS OF

29:49.759 --> 29:50.892
ABUSE, THEY CHAPERONE SCHOOL

29:50.961 --> 29:52.660
EVENTS, AND THEY PRETEND NOT TO

29:52.729 --> 29:54.095
KNOW WHY ELLIE WON'T SIT NEXT TO

29:54.164 --> 29:55.329
RACHEL, RACHEL WON'T SIT NEXT TO

29:55.398 --> 29:56.798
KELSEY, KELSEY'S NOT TALKING TO

29:56.867 --> 29:58.166
ETHAN EVEN THOUGH ETHAN'S HAVING

29:58.235 --> 29:59.500
A JOINT BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH

29:59.569 --> 30:01.002
KELSEY'S BROTHER BRYCE, WHO JUST

30:01.071 --> 30:01.803
HAPPENS TO BE RACHEL'S BOYFRIEND

30:01.872 --> 30:03.137
SINCE LAST PERIOD.

30:03.206 --> 30:04.138
AND THEY DO ALL OF THAT WHILE

30:04.207 --> 30:05.239
ALSO TRYING TO TEACH LONG

30:05.308 --> 30:06.240
DIVISION.

30:06.309 --> 30:07.308
TEACHERS ARE SUPERHEROES WHO

30:07.377 --> 30:09.477
SHOULD MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS A

30:09.546 --> 30:11.879
YEAR.

30:11.948 --> 30:12.680
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

30:12.749 --> 30:13.314
SO YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE THE FACT

30:13.383 --> 30:16.050
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO PULL A KID

30:16.119 --> 30:18.152
OUT OF SCHOOL, WITH NO QUESTIONS

30:18.221 --> 30:20.321
ASKED OR FOLLOWUPS ALLOWED,

30:20.390 --> 30:21.756
COULD EASILY BE EXPLOITED BY

30:21.825 --> 30:23.825
ABUSIVE PARENTS.

30:23.894 --> 30:24.759
ESPECIALLY AS MOST STATES DON'T

30:24.828 --> 30:28.095
EVEN SCREEN HOMESCHOOL PARENTS

30:28.164 --> 30:28.429
FOR RED FLAGS.

30:28.498 --> 30:30.665
48 STATES HAVE NO

30:30.734 --> 30:32.266
BACKGROUND-CHECK PROCESS FOR

30:32.335 --> 30:34.135
PARENTS WHO CHOOSE TO

30:34.204 --> 30:34.435
HOMESCHOOL.

30:34.504 --> 30:36.104
IN FACT, EVEN IF YOU HAVE A

30:36.173 --> 30:37.004
PRIOR CONVICTION OF A CRIME

30:37.073 --> 30:38.272
AGAINST A CHILD, YOU CAN

30:38.341 --> 30:39.507
HOMESCHOOL THEM.

30:39.576 --> 30:40.942
A STUDY DONE IN CONNECTICUT

30:41.011 --> 30:43.277
FOUND THAT OF THE 380 STUDENTS

30:43.346 --> 30:43.911
WITHDRAWN IN SIX DISTRICTS TO BE

30:43.980 --> 30:46.414
HOMESCHOOLED, 138 LIVED IN

30:46.483 --> 30:47.748
FAMILIES THAT WERE THE SUBJECT

30:47.817 --> 30:50.184
OF AT LEAST ONE PRIOR REPORT OF

30:50.253 --> 30:52.820
SUSPECTED ABUSE OR NEGLECT.

30:52.889 --> 30:54.922
AND YET, DESPITE THIS, AT EVERY

30:54.991 --> 30:56.624
TURN, THE HSLDA HAS VIGOROUSLY

30:56.693 --> 30:58.226
FOUGHT EFFORTS TO PUT ANY

30:58.295 --> 31:01.295
GUARDRAILS IN PLACE.

31:01.364 --> 31:03.097
HERE'S THEIR THEN-PRESIDENT, IN

31:03.166 --> 31:04.265
2015, EXPLAINING WHY THEY FIGHT

31:04.334 --> 31:05.433
ALL REGULATIONS, EVEN ONES

31:05.502 --> 31:07.902
EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT

31:07.971 --> 31:11.172
CHILD ABUSE.

31:11.241 --> 31:12.440
>> CHILD ABUSE IS A PARENTAL

31:12.509 --> 31:12.807
ISSUE, ISN'T IT?

31:12.876 --> 31:13.474
ANY CHILD, WHETHER THEY BE A

31:13.543 --> 31:15.977
NON-HOMESCHOOL CHILD -- OR A

31:16.046 --> 31:16.511
PARENT, WHETHER THEY BE A

31:16.580 --> 31:18.312
HOMESCHOOL PARENT, THEY CAN

31:18.381 --> 31:19.313
ABUSE THEIR CHILDREN. THEY HAVE

31:19.382 --> 31:20.915
THE POTENTIAL TO DO IT.

31:20.984 --> 31:21.549
SO, WHY SHOULD WE -- FOR JUST A

31:21.618 --> 31:26.053
FEW -- WHY SHOULD WE FOR JUST A

31:26.122 --> 31:26.954
FEW INVADE ALL OF THE OTHER

31:27.023 --> 31:27.989
INNOCENT PARENTS?

31:28.058 --> 31:28.489
THAT'S PRIOR RESTRAINT.

31:28.558 --> 31:29.824
IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

31:29.893 --> 31:31.492
IT'S UN-AMERICAN.

31:31.561 --> 31:33.327
>> ARE THERE -- ARE THERE SOME

31:33.396 --> 31:34.996
CATEGORIES OF REGULATIONS AROUND

31:35.065 --> 31:36.430
HOMESCHOOLING THAT YOU WOULD

31:36.499 --> 31:38.800
SUPPORT THAT YOU DON'T THINK OF

31:38.869 --> 31:39.400
AS AN INVASION OR A TAKEOVER?

31:39.469 --> 31:46.469
>> NO, NOT ANY.

31:47.077 --> 31:47.642
>> John: OKAY, IT'S BAD ENOUGH

31:47.711 --> 31:49.076
HE'S ARGUING FOR A TOTAL LACK OF

31:49.145 --> 31:50.111
REGULATION, BUT THE FACT THAT HE

31:50.180 --> 31:51.779
OPENLY LICKS THE CORNERS OF HIS

31:51.848 --> 31:53.714
MOUTH BEFORE DOING SO SOMEHOW

31:53.783 --> 31:55.349
MAKES IT WORSE.

31:55.418 --> 31:56.818
HE LOOKS LIKE A CAT WENT TO A

31:56.887 --> 31:58.219
ZOLTAR MACHINE AND MADE A WISH

31:58.288 --> 32:01.222
TO BE ANDY GRIFFITH.

32:01.291 --> 32:03.424
THE HSLDA VIEWS ANY OVERSIGHT

32:03.493 --> 32:04.292
WHATSOEVER AS AN ATTACK, EVEN

32:04.361 --> 32:05.893
OFFERING MEMBERS A 24-HOUR

32:05.962 --> 32:08.029
HOTLINE IN CASE OF A VISIT FROM

32:08.098 --> 32:09.163
THE STATE.

32:09.232 --> 32:10.932
IN FACT, HERE'S THE SISTER OF

32:11.001 --> 32:12.366
THAT WOMAN YOU SAW EARLIER,

32:12.435 --> 32:14.902
EXPLAINING HOW THEY'D PRACTICE

32:14.971 --> 32:16.137
WHAT TO DO IF CHILD PROTECTIVE

32:16.206 --> 32:16.938
SERVICES SHOWED UP ON THEIR

32:17.007 --> 32:18.206
DOORSTEP.

32:18.275 --> 32:18.773
>> THE PARENT WOULD LOCK THE

32:18.842 --> 32:21.075
FRONT DOOR, WOULD CALL THE

32:21.144 --> 32:22.810
HOMESCHOOL LEGAL DEFENSE

32:22.879 --> 32:24.312
ASSOCIATION ON THE PHONE, HAND

32:24.381 --> 32:25.213
THE PHONE OUT THE KITCHEN

32:25.282 --> 32:26.180
WINDOW, AND US KIDS WERE

32:26.249 --> 32:26.681
SUPPOSED TO HIDE IN THE

32:26.750 --> 32:28.583
BASEMENT.

32:28.652 --> 32:30.284
WE ACTUALLY DID DRILLS ON THIS

32:30.353 --> 32:31.385
STUFF, FOLKS.

32:31.454 --> 32:33.588
WE DID DRILLS IN CASE SOMEONE

32:33.657 --> 32:35.590
EVER DECIDED TO CHECK IN ON OUR

32:35.659 --> 32:36.858
WELL-BEING.

32:36.927 --> 32:39.026
>> John: HOLY SHIT, THAT'S DARK.

32:39.095 --> 32:40.728
DRILLS ARE MEANT FOR PRACTICING

32:40.797 --> 32:41.829
WHAT TO DO TO AVOID GETTING

32:41.898 --> 32:44.499
HURT, NOT TO AVOID GETTING HELP.

32:44.568 --> 32:46.367
IT'S WHY FIRE ALARMS SAY "PULL

32:46.436 --> 32:48.302
HERE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY" AND

32:48.371 --> 32:50.671
NOT "SNITCHES GET STITCHES."

32:50.740 --> 32:51.572
AND THE THING IS, BECAUSE OF ITS

32:51.641 --> 32:53.274
COMMITTED MEMBERSHIP, THE HSLDA

32:53.343 --> 32:54.308
HAS THE POWER TO STOP ANY KIND

32:54.377 --> 32:56.811
OF OVERSIGHT IN ITS TRACKS.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.645
TAKE RAYLEE'S LAW, NAMED AFTER

32:57.714 --> 32:59.747
AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN

32:59.816 --> 33:00.748
WEST VIRGINIA WHOSE FATHER

33:00.817 --> 33:01.883
PULLED HER OUT OF SCHOOL AFTER

33:01.952 --> 33:02.817
HE WAS REPORTED FOR ABUSE.

33:02.886 --> 33:04.552
SHE DIED OF NEGLECT ONLY A FEW

33:04.621 --> 33:06.420
WEEKS LATER.

33:06.489 --> 33:08.356
EVENTUALLY, LEGISLATORS PROPOSED

33:08.425 --> 33:08.990
A LAW THAT WOULD PREVENT PARENTS

33:09.059 --> 33:10.124
FROM WITHDRAWING A CHILD FROM

33:10.193 --> 33:11.225
SCHOOL WHEN THERE IS A PENDING

33:11.294 --> 33:14.095
CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT

33:14.164 --> 33:14.796
INVESTIGATION OR WHEN A PARENT

33:14.865 --> 33:16.430
HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC

33:16.499 --> 33:17.031
VIOLENCE, CHILD ABUSE OR

33:17.100 --> 33:22.136
NEGLECT.

33:22.205 --> 33:23.371
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'D BE EASY TO

33:23.440 --> 33:24.105
GET PASSED, RIGHT?

33:24.174 --> 33:25.239
BUT AS THE LEGISLATOR WHO

33:25.308 --> 33:25.840
PROPOSED IT FOUND OUT, NOT SO

33:25.909 --> 33:26.040
MUCH.

33:26.109 --> 33:29.043
>> THERE ARE GROUPS I WANT TO

33:29.112 --> 33:31.846
SAY, THERE'S LIKE THIS

33:31.915 --> 33:33.748
HOMESCHOOL DEFENSE FUND GROUP

33:33.817 --> 33:34.882
THAT CAME OUT AGAINST RAYLEE'S

33:34.951 --> 33:35.049
LAW.

33:35.118 --> 33:35.383
>> THE HSLDA?

33:35.452 --> 33:36.083
>> THAT'S IT.

33:36.152 --> 33:37.251
AND THERE WERE QUOTES ABOUT HOW

33:37.320 --> 33:38.886
AWFUL THIS BILL WAS AND IT'S AN

33:38.955 --> 33:40.555
ATTACK ON HOMESCHOOLING AND, YOU

33:40.624 --> 33:41.489
KNOW, THEY WANT TO MOVE THE --

33:41.558 --> 33:43.191
THE GOAL POST.

33:43.260 --> 33:44.725
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN POLITICS,

33:44.794 --> 33:45.726
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE

33:45.795 --> 33:46.828
PROTECTING CHILDREN, YOU

33:46.897 --> 33:51.732
WOULDN'T ACTUALLY GO ABOUT THAT.

33:51.801 --> 33:54.135
>> John: RIGHT, AND THAT SEEMS

33:54.204 --> 33:54.535
PRETTY REASONABLE.

33:54.604 --> 33:55.136
AND IF THE HSLDA THINKS TRYING

33:55.205 --> 33:55.770
TO PROTECT KIDS FROM BEING TAKEN

33:55.839 --> 33:56.471
OUT OF SCHOOL BY PEOPLE

33:56.540 --> 33:57.071
CONVICTED OF CHILD ABUSE IS AN

33:57.140 --> 34:00.007
"ATTACK ON HOMESCHOOLING"

34:00.076 --> 34:00.641
THEY'RE SAYING QUITE A BIT ABOUT

34:00.710 --> 34:01.275
WHAT THEY BELIEVE HOMESCHOOLING

34:01.344 --> 34:02.210
TO BE.

34:02.279 --> 34:04.479
IF CHILI'S RESPONDED TO A HEALTH

34:04.548 --> 34:06.781
INSPECTOR WRITING THEIR WORKERS

34:06.850 --> 34:07.582
UP FOR PISSING IN THE SKILLET

34:07.651 --> 34:08.850
QUESO WITH "THIS IS AN ATTACK ON

34:08.919 --> 34:10.918
EVERYTHING CHILI'S STANDS FOR,

34:10.987 --> 34:12.687
DON'T PUNISH THE MAJORITY OF OUR

34:12.756 --> 34:16.157
STAFF FOR THE MINORITY WHO PISS

34:16.226 --> 34:16.691
AND SHIT IN OUR PRESIDENTE

34:16.760 --> 34:17.758
MARGARITAS," YOU'D HAVE SOME

34:17.827 --> 34:19.727
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT CHILLI'S

34:19.796 --> 34:21.562
THINKS IT STANDS FOR.

34:21.631 --> 34:22.430
AND FOR THE RECORD, THAT MAN'S

34:22.499 --> 34:24.198
BILL NEVER PASSED.

34:24.267 --> 34:25.099
AND THAT STORY'S BEEN REPEATED

34:25.168 --> 34:28.503
IN STATE AFTER STATE.

34:28.572 --> 34:33.074
AS ONE LEGISLATIVE AIDE WHO'S

34:33.143 --> 34:33.708
GONE UP AGAINST HSLDA HAS SAID,

34:33.777 --> 34:34.308
"I'VE NEVER SEEN A LOBBY MORE

34:34.377 --> 34:34.742
POWERFUL AND SCARY."

34:34.811 --> 34:35.877
AND A LEGISLATOR IN ARKANSAS WHO

34:35.946 --> 34:37.445
TANGLED WITH THEM SAYS, "THEY

34:37.514 --> 34:39.781
TOLD ME THE ONLY LEGISLATION

34:39.850 --> 34:42.316
THEY WANTED WAS WHAT ALASKA HAD,

34:42.385 --> 34:42.750
WHICH WAS NOTHING."

34:42.819 --> 34:44.986
AT A CERTAIN POINT, IT STAR TO

34:45.055 --> 34:46.454
FEEL LIKE THE HSLDA IS BASICALLY

34:46.523 --> 34:47.922
THE HOMESCHOOLING EQUIVALENT OF

34:47.991 --> 34:48.589
THE NRA -- AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL

34:48.658 --> 34:51.726
ORGANIZATION THAT, WHILE IT

34:51.795 --> 34:52.894
REPRESENTS A LARGE NUMBER OF

34:52.963 --> 34:54.328
PEOPLE, PURSUES AN

34:54.397 --> 34:54.896
OUTERMOST-FRINGE VERSION OF

34:54.965 --> 34:56.631
THEIR AGENDA.

34:56.700 --> 34:58.366
SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

34:58.435 --> 34:59.534
WELL, IN A PERFECT WORLD, WE'D

34:59.603 --> 35:01.569
MAKE SURE THAT HOMESCHOOL KIDS

35:01.638 --> 35:03.838
WERE BOTH SAFE, AND ACTUALLY

35:03.907 --> 35:04.505
RECEIVING A FUNCTIONAL

35:04.574 --> 35:05.540
EDUCATION.

35:05.609 --> 35:08.109
AND THERE ARE SMALLER

35:08.178 --> 35:08.676
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THIS ONE,

35:08.745 --> 35:10.077
PUSHING FOR THOSE SORTS OF

35:10.146 --> 35:10.545
CHANGES.

35:10.614 --> 35:12.313
BUT AT THE BAREST MINIMUM, WE

35:12.382 --> 35:13.481
COULD REQUIRE, IN ALL 50 STATES,

35:13.550 --> 35:16.484
TO REGISTER A CHILD AS

35:16.553 --> 35:17.552
HOMESCHOOLED, SO THERE'S AT

35:17.621 --> 35:22.089
LEAST A RECORD THAT THEY EXIST.

35:22.158 --> 35:23.057
THAT IS HOW LOW THE BAR IS HERE,

35:23.126 --> 35:24.158
AT THE EARTH'S CORE -- WHICH I'M

35:24.227 --> 35:25.760
SURE, ACCORDING TO AT LEAST ONE

35:25.829 --> 35:26.627
HOMESCHOOLING TEXTBOOK, IS

35:26.696 --> 35:30.331
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SOIL AND THE

35:30.400 --> 35:31.032
FIERY BOWELS OF HELL.

35:31.101 --> 35:31.933
BUT BEYOND THAT, WE COULD PASS

35:32.002 --> 35:35.369
SOME BASIC CHILD SAFETY

35:35.438 --> 35:36.571
PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE PARENTS

35:36.640 --> 35:38.439
CAN'T PULL THEIR KIDS OUT OF

35:38.508 --> 35:39.040
SCHOOL TO ESCAPE SCRUTINY FOR

35:39.109 --> 35:40.508
ABUSE.

35:40.577 --> 35:42.276
A FEW YEARS AGO, TO ITS CREDIT,

35:42.345 --> 35:43.311
GEORGIA PASSED A LAW THAT

35:43.380 --> 35:44.579
REQUIRES PARENTS WHO PULL KIDS

35:44.648 --> 35:45.880
OUT OF SCHOOL FOR NO REASON TO

35:45.949 --> 35:49.684
SEND DOCUMENTATION WITHIN 45

35:49.753 --> 35:50.952
DAYS THAT THEY'RE HOMESCHOOLING

35:51.021 --> 35:52.153
THEIR CHILD, OR PROOF OF

35:52.222 --> 35:54.922
ATTENDANCE AT ANOTHER SCHOOL.

35:54.991 --> 35:55.823
IF THEY DON'T, THEY'RE SUBJECT

35:55.892 --> 35:57.391
TO A FOLLOW-UP FROM THE STATE.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.960
AND EVEN THIS REPUBLICAN GEORGIA

35:59.029 --> 35:59.594
STATE REP ACKNOWLEDGED, IT WAS

35:59.663 --> 36:02.997
NEEDED.

36:03.066 --> 36:03.598
>> IF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR WORLD

36:03.667 --> 36:06.167
THAT YOU BELIEVE ARE MOST

36:06.236 --> 36:07.802
PROTECTIVE OF YOU ARE -- ARE

36:07.871 --> 36:09.771
TORTURING YOU OR ABUSING YOU.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.404
WHO'S GOING TO -- WHO'S GOING TO

36:10.473 --> 36:11.439
LOOK OUT FOR YOU?

36:11.508 --> 36:12.039
I MEAN -- I DON'T, YOU KNOW, I

36:12.108 --> 36:13.074
DON'T LIKE GOVERNMENT

36:13.143 --> 36:14.575
INTERVENTION IN A LOT OF THINGS,

36:14.644 --> 36:15.109
BUT I DON'T, YOU KNOW, THE

36:15.178 --> 36:16.511
GOVERNMENT'S THE ONLY PERSON

36:16.580 --> 36:17.578
THAT I KNOW THAT CAN INTERVENE

36:17.647 --> 36:18.179
IN THIS KIND OF CASE TO SAVE A

36:18.248 --> 36:19.180
CHILD.

36:19.249 --> 36:20.815
>> John: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

36:20.884 --> 36:22.383
HE'S JUST COMPLETELY RIGHT.

36:22.452 --> 36:23.851
AND AGREEING WITH A STAUNCH

36:23.920 --> 36:25.219
REPUBLICAN GEORGIA STATE REP

36:25.288 --> 36:29.056
WASN'T SOMETHING I HAD ON MY

36:29.125 --> 36:29.423
2023 BINGO CARD.

36:29.492 --> 36:30.725
I'VE ALMOST GOT A FULL BINGO BY

36:30.794 --> 36:32.026
THE WAY, I'M JUST WAITING ON YOU

36:32.095 --> 36:36.330
KNOW WHO TO YOU KNOW WHAT.

36:36.399 --> 36:36.898
AND TO BE CLEAR, I SHARE HIS

36:36.967 --> 36:37.632
AMBIVALENCE ABOUT GOVERNMENT

36:37.701 --> 36:38.766
INTERVENTION HERE.

36:38.835 --> 36:40.301
I UNDERSTAND THAT INVOLVING

36:40.370 --> 36:41.736
SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE

36:41.805 --> 36:42.603
GOVERNMENT IN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL

36:42.672 --> 36:44.472
SITUATIONS POSES A RISK,

36:44.541 --> 36:46.407
ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO AREN'T

36:46.476 --> 36:47.542
WEALTHY AND WHO AREN'T WHITE.

36:47.611 --> 36:49.477
IT'S NOT LIKE I LOVE THE IDEA OF

36:49.546 --> 36:50.812
GIVING THE STATE ROOM TO POKE

36:50.881 --> 36:52.580
AROUND IN PEOPLE'S LIVES, OR

36:52.649 --> 36:54.215
THAT I THINK OUR CHILD

36:54.284 --> 36:54.816
PROTECTIVE SERVICES SYSTEM IS

36:54.885 --> 36:56.350
FLAWLESS, NO NOTES.

36:56.419 --> 36:57.785
WE'RE ALMOST DEFINITELY GOING TO

36:57.854 --> 36:58.686
BE DOING A MAIN STORY ON CPS ONE

36:58.755 --> 37:00.688
DAY.

37:00.757 --> 37:02.723
BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE GIVING

37:02.792 --> 37:04.525
PARENTS A "GET OUT OF ALL

37:04.594 --> 37:05.793
SCRUTINY FREE, NO QUESTIONS

37:05.862 --> 37:06.828
ASKED" CARD JUST ISN'T THE

37:06.897 --> 37:08.529
ANSWER HERE.

37:08.598 --> 37:10.231
BECAUSE BEING A PARENT DOESN'T

37:10.300 --> 37:10.765
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE SOMEONE

37:10.834 --> 37:11.833
MORAL.

37:11.902 --> 37:13.501
AND BEING WITH A PARENT DOESN'T

37:13.570 --> 37:16.003
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE A CHILD SAFE.

37:16.072 --> 37:17.905
AND THE TRUTH IS, A FEW EXTRA

37:17.974 --> 37:19.407
SECURITY MEASURES WOULD NOT HURT

37:19.476 --> 37:22.310
THE MANY PARENTS WHO HOMESCHOOL

37:22.379 --> 37:23.211
THEIR CHILDREN RESPONSIBLY, BUT

37:23.280 --> 37:24.712
THEY'D DEFINITELY SAFEGUARD

37:24.781 --> 37:26.948
AGAINST THOSE WHO USE "PERSONAL

37:27.017 --> 37:28.549
LIBERTY" AS AN EXCUSE TO NEGLECT

37:28.618 --> 37:30.418
OR HARM THEIR KIDS.

37:30.487 --> 37:31.018
THE HSLDA CAN SAY ALL IT WANTS

37:31.087 --> 37:32.420
THAT IT DOESN'T SUPPORT NAZIS OR

37:32.489 --> 37:34.455
CHILD ABUSERS.

37:34.524 --> 37:36.924
BUT THE FACT IS, THE POLICIES IT

37:36.993 --> 37:40.928
RELENTLESSLY PUSHES ALLOW THEM

37:40.997 --> 37:41.963
TO THRIVE.

37:42.032 --> 37:42.897
AND BASIC REFORMS HERE SHOULDN'T

37:42.966 --> 37:44.499
BE REMOTELY CONTROVERSIAL,

37:44.568 --> 37:45.600
BECAUSE AFTER ALL, THIS IS ABOUT

37:45.669 --> 37:46.501
CHILD WELFARE.

37:46.570 --> 37:48.035
THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

37:48.104 --> 37:50.738
IT'S NOT EVEN A HOME SHEEP-EYE

37:50.807 --> 37:52.340
DISSECTION -- DON'T GOOGLE IT,

37:52.409 --> 37:53.908
BY THE WAY, I CANNOT EMPHASIZE

37:53.977 --> 37:54.909
THAT ENOUGH.

37:54.978 --> 37:56.444
ALL OF THIS IS JUST BASIC COMMON

37:56.513 --> 37:57.578
SENSE.

37:57.647 --> 37:59.814
AND NOW, THIS.

37:59.883 --> 38:02.683
>> Announcer: AND NOW, THE

38:02.752 --> 38:04.786
SURPRISING IMPORTANCE OF EMOJIS

38:04.855 --> 38:09.791
ON DIVORCE COURT.

38:09.860 --> 38:10.792
>> AM I UNDERSTANDING, BECAUSE I

38:10.861 --> 38:11.359
HAD SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME

38:11.428 --> 38:13.261
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET IT.

38:13.330 --> 38:18.466

38:18.535 --> 38:20.968

38:21.037 --> 38:22.637
YOU POSTED A WATERFALL WHICH

38:22.706 --> 38:25.540
MEANS YOU ARE IN A STATE OF

38:25.609 --> 38:32.480
SEXUAL EXULTATION.

38:32.549 --> 38:33.548

38:34.551 --> 38:34.816

38:35.418 --> 38:39.287
SPLASHING EMOJIS?

38:39.356 --> 38:42.223

38:42.292 --> 38:45.960

38:48.365 --> 38:48.763
EMOJI TO YOUR COUSIN?

38:49.466 --> 38:49.597
HUMOR.

DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

38:54.337 --> 39:00.041
LEAVE A DROOLING FACE EMOJI, AND

39:00.110 --> 39:04.946
WHY WAS SHE SAVED ON YOUR
