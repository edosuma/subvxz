WEBVTT

00:15.667 --> 00:18.458
[beeping]

00:25.667 --> 00:28.375
[beeping]

00:31.333 --> 00:32.458
Yes?

00:32.542 --> 00:34.208
Uh, Delenn,
my apologies for waking you

00:34.292 --> 00:35.708
but when I saw your message
I thought I had

00:35.792 --> 00:38.417
to contact you at once
to see if there's a problem.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.750
What problem?

00:39.833 --> 00:41.125
We would never let
someone of your stature

00:41.208 --> 00:43.000
go without assistance
for very long.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.458
And we're fully prepared
to send along

00:44.542 --> 00:47.000
as many potential replacements
as you like

00:47.083 --> 00:48.792
uh, knowing
that you've always been

00:48.875 --> 00:50.792
so wonderfully egalitarian.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.250
Uh, we can even
fill the position

00:52.333 --> 00:54.083
with three assistants,
one from each caste--

00:54.167 --> 00:57.500
Ruell.
What are you talking about?

00:57.583 --> 01:00.500
- I sent you no message.
- Oh, you didn't?

01:00.583 --> 01:03.958
No! And what is this
about a replacement?

01:04.042 --> 01:05.833
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

01:05.917 --> 01:09.125
Uh, the message is a request,
you see, in your name

01:09.208 --> 01:12.458
uh, for the replacement
of your assistant, Lennier.

01:12.542 --> 01:15.292
'He has made arrangements
to return home.'

01:15.375 --> 01:18.167
What? For how long?

01:18.250 --> 01:19.667
Well, I believe
the request stated

01:19.750 --> 01:22.542
that his return
would be permanent.

01:28.583 --> 01:31.708
(Mollari)
No! No, no!

01:31.792 --> 01:33.875
This is completely unacceptable!

01:33.958 --> 01:36.708
- Londo, maybe we should--
- Please!

01:36.792 --> 01:40.458
Uh, do you know
what this is, hm?

01:41.667 --> 01:42.875
No, I can see you do not.

01:42.958 --> 01:45.500
You have that vacant look
in your eyes that says

01:45.583 --> 01:48.500
"Hold my head to your ear,
you'll hear the sea."

01:48.583 --> 01:51.833
This is Brivari,
very old Brivari

01:51.917 --> 01:53.333
very expensive Brivari.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.625
Do you understand Brivari, hm?

01:55.708 --> 01:57.708
'No, it is a delicate drink'

01:57.792 --> 02:00.625
and the flavor
is extremely fragile.

02:00.708 --> 02:04.042
It must be kept at a constant
temperature at all times!

02:04.125 --> 02:05.625
If you were to impound it

02:05.708 --> 02:07.708
and stick it
in a hot, little room

02:07.792 --> 02:10.500
in a matter of hours,
the flavor would bleed away

02:10.583 --> 02:14.333
and vanish like the synapses
in your brain!

02:14.417 --> 02:15.958
Lo-Londo, please.

02:16.042 --> 02:19.083
I'm sorry, ambassador,
but I have my orders.

02:19.167 --> 02:22.750
You see, we've had a problem
with infestation recently.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.708
So on all incoming foods

02:24.792 --> 02:27.167
there's a minimum
three-day impound.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.792
Well, do you see, Vir?

02:28.875 --> 02:31.625
You give someone
a little authority and a badge

02:31.708 --> 02:33.708
and he thinks
he runs the universe.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.333
Five years
I have been on this station

02:36.417 --> 02:39.875
and never once has my shipment
of Brivari been quarantined

02:39.958 --> 02:41.417
for health inspection.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.042
This is an insult!

02:43.125 --> 02:46.000
Londo, please, let me try
to handle this, okay?

02:46.083 --> 02:48.042
Please?

02:48.125 --> 02:50.708
M-Mr. Allan, may I, please?

02:53.542 --> 02:55.667
You are more than welcome
to try, Vir.

02:55.750 --> 02:56.917
No, here, take my shoe.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.583
It will be
as useful to you as he is.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.250
Mr. Allan.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.625
I hope you understand,
but the ambassador

03:05.708 --> 03:08.792
'has been under a great deal
of strain lately.'

03:08.875 --> 03:11.958
'And, you know, he is about
to become the emperor, so..'

03:12.042 --> 03:14.333
(Allan)
'I don't care
if he's been declared'

03:14.417 --> 03:17.750
'high eminent favah
of the Imperial Galaxy'

03:17.833 --> 03:20.042
'the Brivari stays here.'

03:21.167 --> 03:22.167
[glass shattering]

03:22.250 --> 03:23.708
What the..

03:24.333 --> 03:25.417
Londo!

03:29.250 --> 03:30.375
Zack to Medlab.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.125
Here we got an emergency
down in Impound 31.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.750
Get me a med team
down here stat!

03:36.542 --> 03:38.250
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.625
- There's a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

03:40.708 --> 03:42.833
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.708
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.958
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair's
being reassigned.

03:47.042 --> 03:48.583
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

03:48.667 --> 03:50.625
(Elric)
I see a great hand

03:50.708 --> 03:52.708
reaching out of the stars.

03:52.792 --> 03:55.375
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring..

03:55.458 --> 03:57.917
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.292
Unless your people
get off their

03:59.375 --> 04:00.792
encounter-suited butts
and do something..

04:00.875 --> 04:02.333
(Zathras)
You are the one who was.

04:02.417 --> 04:05.583
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

04:05.667 --> 04:08.708
(Lorien)
Why are you here? Do you have
anything worth living for?

04:08.792 --> 04:10.292
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.750
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.458
Get the hell
out of our galaxy!

04:13.542 --> 04:16.667
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.542
[theme music]

04:48.625 --> 04:51.458
[music continues]

05:09.083 --> 05:11.250
- Londo? Be careful with him.
- Dr. Franklin, they're here.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.292
(male #1)
'Poison control team to Medlab.'

05:14.667 --> 05:16.250
Alright, I want him
on the scanners fast!

05:16.333 --> 05:18.792
I want a toxology report
in two minutes. Now, go.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.875
- Are you sure he was poisoned?
- Yes, yes.

05:20.958 --> 05:22.250
I only left him for a moment.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.625
He opened up
a bottle of Brivari

05:23.708 --> 05:25.500
took a few drinks
and then collapsed!

05:25.583 --> 05:27.500
The bottles were marked for him
and nobody else?

05:27.583 --> 05:29.458
Watch the blood pressure,
it's dropping now!

05:29.542 --> 05:31.500
- Where's the bottle now?
- Security took them.

05:31.583 --> 05:32.708
They're doing
a chemical analysis on it.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.083
Alright, alright. Alright.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.208
There's nothing else
you can do right now.

05:35.292 --> 05:36.625
Well, let us handle it, alright?

05:36.708 --> 05:37.958
As soon as I find anything,
I'll let you know.

05:38.042 --> 05:39.292
- But, doctor--
- Go, we're on it.

05:39.375 --> 05:40.833
Let's go, people!

05:40.917 --> 05:43.917
(male #1)
'Toxology lab, stand by
for emergency analysis.'

05:55.375 --> 05:56.667
[door opens]

05:59.083 --> 06:02.042
- Good morning, Delenn.
- Lennier.

06:02.125 --> 06:05.125
You have a very busy schedule
for the day.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.792
A representative of Kepti
has asked to speak with you

06:07.875 --> 06:09.833
about joining the Alliance.

06:09.917 --> 06:13.417
He wants to get your permission
before speaking with Sheridan.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.542
'After that,
you have four meetings--'

06:15.625 --> 06:17.500
When were you going to tell me?

06:18.708 --> 06:21.083
- Tell you what?
- That you are leaving.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.125
Ruell called this morning

06:24.208 --> 06:26.333
about helping me
find your replacement.

06:28.542 --> 06:31.917
I did not think
they would move so fast.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.417
I was going to tell you tonight,
Delenn, after dinner.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.250
Why?

06:45.375 --> 06:49.333
Because bad news
improves on a good meal.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.333
- 'Valen said that--'
- Lennier.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.167
I know.

06:56.042 --> 06:58.625
Because you don't..

06:59.542 --> 07:01.167
I feel..

07:01.250 --> 07:04.333
...that you don't need me here
anymore, Delenn.

07:04.417 --> 07:07.042
That is not true, Lennier.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.500
Yes, it is.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.833
You have Sheridan now.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.625
He is now your other half.

07:15.542 --> 07:17.125
And..

07:17.208 --> 07:19.542
...I'm in the way.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.167
I'm not comfortable here
anymore, Delenn.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.083
It's not your fault
and it's not his fault.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.333
I can't explain it
any more than that, but..

07:34.375 --> 07:35.833
I know why.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.625
So..

07:49.125 --> 07:52.000
I think it would be best
for both of us

07:52.083 --> 07:53.875
if I were elsewhere.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.500
You swore yourself to my side.

07:58.375 --> 07:59.708
And I will be there, Delenn

07:59.792 --> 08:01.792
when you need me or if you..

08:04.292 --> 08:06.125
'I've contacted the Rangers'

08:06.208 --> 08:08.083
'and asked to join them.'

08:08.167 --> 08:09.750
They said yes.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.708
I'll leave for Minbar tomorrow.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.083
The Rangers? Why?

08:16.167 --> 08:18.875
Lennier, you know that
that is extremely dangerous.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.583
With, with Marcus gone..

08:22.667 --> 08:25.708
...I-I felt the loss
of a part of myself.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.250
Perhaps I will find it again

08:28.333 --> 08:30.583
by replacing him
in the Anla'Shok.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.375
And perhaps in time..

08:34.458 --> 08:36.542
...I will earn your respect.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.208
You have always
had my respect, Lennier.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.167
Yes, in most ways..

08:48.375 --> 08:52.583
...but I only wish
to add a few more..

08:52.667 --> 08:56.417
...to become more of what
you might want me to be

08:56.500 --> 08:59.292
more of what you might find.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.750
My-my decision
is-is made, Delenn.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.333
I will return to help
and to visit

09:05.417 --> 09:07.500
in between training cycles.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.000
This is the calling
of my heart, Delenn.

09:17.042 --> 09:18.542
I have to follow it.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.708
You, above all,
should understand that.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.208
- Vir.
- Mr. Garibaldi.

09:28.292 --> 09:30.708
I just came back from Medlab.
They asked me to find you.

09:30.792 --> 09:33.417
- How is he?
- He's not good, Vir.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.958
- He's in critical condition.
- I don't believe this.

09:37.042 --> 09:38.542
What is it with this place?

09:38.625 --> 09:40.625
I mean, last week someone tries
to assassinate Sheridan

09:40.708 --> 09:43.625
now someone tries
to poison Londo. God!

09:43.708 --> 09:45.708
What is wrong with you people?

09:45.792 --> 09:47.833
Don't you have
anything else better to do?

09:47.917 --> 09:49.792
Why don't you get a hobby,
read a book or something--

09:49.875 --> 09:52.000
- Vir!
- What?

09:52.083 --> 09:53.958
He wasn't poisoned.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.583
Wait a second.
I saw him, I saw--

09:55.667 --> 09:57.542
I know what you saw,
but he wasn't poisoned.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.500
What he drank had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

10:00.583 --> 10:04.125
He's had a heart attack, Vir,
a bad one.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.125
What?

10:06.208 --> 10:07.583
Which heart?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.250
The left one.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.292
(Franklin)
The Centauri
have a bi-pulmonary system.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.667
'Two hearts, one on
either side of the sternum.'

10:17.750 --> 10:19.167
'Right heart provides
most of the force'

10:19.250 --> 10:20.458
behind their blood circulation

10:20.542 --> 10:22.625
and the left heart
cleanses the blood

10:22.708 --> 10:24.958
almost the same way
our human kidney works

10:25.042 --> 10:26.583
also gives
the additional push needed

10:26.667 --> 10:29.417
to get the blood through
to the smaller capillaries.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.417
Now, the right heart
is one solid muscle.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.875
I can fix that, no problem.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.333
It's the left heart.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.917
A system of very fine veins

10:36.000 --> 10:39.125
thousands of them, all in one
large, knotted structure.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.958
And you can't get
to the inner ones

10:41.042 --> 10:43.167
without cutting through
the outer ones, am I right?

10:43.250 --> 10:45.708
That's correct, which only
makes the problem worse.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.375
So what can you do?

10:47.458 --> 10:48.375
I've thinned his blood to help

10:48.458 --> 10:49.542
it move past the blockage

10:49.625 --> 10:50.792
but it's, it's not just a matter

10:50.875 --> 10:52.292
of junk in the way.

10:52.375 --> 10:54.583
I mean, his arterial system
has basically shut down

10:54.667 --> 10:56.375
from all the stress and anxiety

10:56.458 --> 10:58.375
'and pressure he's been under.'

10:58.458 --> 11:00.250
The veins carrying the blood
through his left heart

11:00.333 --> 11:02.667
have contracted to nearly
half their normal size.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.500
Now, I've tried muscle relaxants

11:04.583 --> 11:07.083
I've sent nano sects in
to cut from the inside

11:07.167 --> 11:08.500
but nothing seems to work.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.625
Have you notified
Centauri Prime?

11:10.708 --> 11:12.583
Yeah, they're sending
an artificial heart system.

11:12.667 --> 11:13.958
It may be able to help

11:14.042 --> 11:15.625
but it's gonna take
three days to get here.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.333
Now, at best,
I can keep him going

11:17.417 --> 11:18.917
for the next 24 hours
on life support.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.208
So unless
something happens on its own

11:22.292 --> 11:24.583
he's gonna be dead
by the time it gets here.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.667
[beeping]

11:37.333 --> 11:39.875
[beeping]

11:45.125 --> 11:47.042
- Any change?
- No.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.667
Oh, it is strange
to see him like this.

11:51.750 --> 11:55.417
He's always so alive,
so full of energy

11:55.500 --> 11:58.167
even when he's being annoying.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.458
Y-you know, I don't think I've
ever seen him for two minutes

12:01.542 --> 12:04.042
when he wasn't talking
or yelling at someone.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.208
- It's a strange thing.
- Hm.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.625
In the five years
since I arrived

12:08.708 --> 12:10.458
I have felt pity for him, anger

12:10.542 --> 12:12.292
he has made me laugh.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.958
I have even liked him
from time to time

12:15.042 --> 12:17.792
as much as I haven't wanted to

12:17.875 --> 12:19.833
but I have never
felt sorry for him..

12:20.958 --> 12:22.417
'...until now.'

12:23.458 --> 12:25.000
[sighs]

12:25.083 --> 12:27.583
I would miss him, uh,
if he left us, John.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.417
I know, so would I.

12:33.458 --> 12:35.208
Uh, speaking of going away

12:35.292 --> 12:37.500
I got your message
about Lennier.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.833
- 'Is there anything I can do?'
- Almost certainly not.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.792
Is it because of me?

12:48.042 --> 12:49.167
I mean..

12:50.333 --> 12:53.458
In part, um, I think so.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.375
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

12:56.750 --> 13:00.333
Well, as we say back on Earth..

13:00.417 --> 13:02.333
...three is a crowd.

13:02.417 --> 13:05.833
On Minbar, three is sacred.

13:05.917 --> 13:09.708
[chuckles]
Well, I don't think I'm ready
to handle that one, Delenn.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.917
Is there any chance
you can talk him out of leaving?

13:15.000 --> 13:18.250
No. He must follow
the calling of his heart.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.292
And if he's not?

13:20.375 --> 13:22.625
I mean,
if he's just running away

13:22.708 --> 13:24.250
to avoid the situation here?

13:24.333 --> 13:27.208
The universe will teach him
what he needs to know.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.958
Yeah, I guess.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.417
Well, it is getting late.
We need to get some sleep.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.833
We've got a long day
ahead of us tomorrow.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.333
What about Londo?

13:41.292 --> 13:43.000
Stephen's done all he can.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.792
If Londo makes it through
the night, he has a chance.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.375
If not..

13:49.458 --> 13:51.542
I mean, medical science
can only go so far

13:51.625 --> 13:54.083
after that
it's all up to the patient.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.458
He has to fight this one out
on his own.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.917
Whether he makes it through
the night or not

14:01.000 --> 14:02.417
depends on him.

14:08.042 --> 14:10.000
Good luck, Mollari.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.667
Good luck.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.417
[beeping]

14:25.500 --> 14:27.125
Good luck, Mollari.

14:28.625 --> 14:29.833
Good luck.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.000
Delenn?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.833
Have you seen Delenn?

14:40.125 --> 14:42.333
I thought I..

14:42.417 --> 14:44.292
I thought that I had heard..

14:49.792 --> 14:51.875
Have you seen Delenn?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.083
Is she here?

14:59.208 --> 15:01.000
Delenn? Have you..

15:04.417 --> 15:06.667
I thought that I had heard..

15:15.417 --> 15:16.542
Delenn?

15:28.917 --> 15:31.167
(Delenn)
Please, sit.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.125
My future?

15:55.750 --> 15:57.542
Your past.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.667
You're dying, Londo.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.208
I know.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.000
Do you want to live?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.458
What difference
does it make, hm?

16:43.542 --> 16:44.875
Perhaps..

16:46.875 --> 16:49.417
Perhaps it's better this way.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.583
I have dreamed my own death
for 20 years now, you know?

16:52.667 --> 16:53.958
[laughing]

16:56.500 --> 16:59.083
Perhaps it's better if I die now

16:59.167 --> 17:02.750
if only to, to spite fate.

17:02.833 --> 17:05.417
Do you want to live?

17:05.500 --> 17:08.708
What difference does it make?

17:08.792 --> 17:12.458
Is there anyone back home
who truly cares..

17:12.542 --> 17:14.708
...if I live or die?

17:14.792 --> 17:16.792
Almost certainly not.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.958
Do you want to live?

17:32.875 --> 17:34.833
I'm not allowed to ask again.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.583
Yes.

17:40.542 --> 17:43.042
Yes, I want to live.

17:43.125 --> 17:45.125
That is not enough.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.833
Can you see this card?

17:53.917 --> 17:56.458
No. There's too much blood.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.583
Yes.

18:01.667 --> 18:04.750
You said wanting to live
was not enough.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.375
What more is there?

18:07.458 --> 18:10.542
- A word.
- What word?

18:16.375 --> 18:18.333
Why won't you tell me?

18:19.708 --> 18:22.500
If that is all I need,
just a word

18:22.583 --> 18:24.042
why won't you tell me?

18:27.583 --> 18:31.292
If you will not tell me,
why am I here?

18:32.208 --> 18:34.000
What is this place?

18:39.042 --> 18:41.875
[heartbeats]

18:57.333 --> 19:00.125
[heartbeats]

19:09.875 --> 19:12.750
[heartbeats]

19:27.375 --> 19:29.208
I don't understand.

19:29.917 --> 19:32.792
'Yes. You do.'

19:37.458 --> 19:38.583
Delenn?

19:46.708 --> 19:49.750
[beeping]

20:00.167 --> 20:02.375
[indistinct chattering]

20:14.417 --> 20:16.917
- You couldn't sleep, either.
- No.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.000
I heard about your situation.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.917
I heard about yours.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.375
As Mr. Garibaldi would say

20:27.458 --> 20:29.583
it's been one hell of a day.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.458
Oh, yes, a hell of a day.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.917
And a hell of a year.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.833
A hell of a five years.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.875
A hell of a life.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.833
You win.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.792
What kind of a drink is that?

20:52.875 --> 20:57.708
I'm not sure, the bartender
called it a Shirley Temple.

20:59.583 --> 21:00.667
Interesting.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.958
I've studied
many Earth religions, um..

21:04.042 --> 21:07.750
I don't think I've ever heard
of that particular temple.

21:07.833 --> 21:12.250
Me, neither,
but it's real good.

21:12.333 --> 21:15.250
Well, then I shall
make it a point to visit it

21:15.333 --> 21:18.292
on my next trip to Earth.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.792
[sighs]
Now, you should sleep.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.583
I won't be getting
much sleep tonight.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.875
What time do you leave
in the morning?

21:31.583 --> 21:32.750
Early.

21:36.958 --> 21:39.042
Well..

21:39.125 --> 21:41.792
Then I'll catch up with you
on your next visit.

21:43.583 --> 21:46.792
- Take care, Lennier.
- And you, Vir.

21:53.333 --> 21:56.167
[instrumental music]

22:13.750 --> 22:16.833
[indistinct chattering]

22:47.375 --> 22:50.167
[dramatic music]

23:16.042 --> 23:18.458
So tell me, Sheridan.

23:18.542 --> 23:20.917
Do you ever get used to it?

23:22.708 --> 23:25.417
[sighs]
Used to what?

23:25.500 --> 23:27.000
Being dead?

23:28.250 --> 23:31.042
Yeah, I wasn't dead
very long, but..

23:31.125 --> 23:34.625
Well, just long enough
to know I didn't like it.

23:34.708 --> 23:37.208
You know, I have been dead
many times before.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.292
Yeah?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.500
Dead to my first wife

23:39.583 --> 23:42.833
the only one I truly loved,
a dancer.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.417
My family said

23:45.500 --> 23:49.125
that I had married
beneath my station

23:49.208 --> 23:50.667
and that if I did not
divorce her

23:50.750 --> 23:53.000
that I would be dead to them

23:53.083 --> 23:56.625
to the family title,
position, money.

23:56.708 --> 23:59.667
I remember the look in her eyes
when I told her.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.250
I died again that night.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.250
All of the bottles here
are empty?

24:09.333 --> 24:12.917
The metaphor's getting a bit
thick, don't you think?

24:15.750 --> 24:18.708
I hear, you once had a dream
about your own death.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.042
Yes, and it's a strange thing

24:21.125 --> 24:24.042
because I always had this sense

24:24.125 --> 24:26.292
that you were going to be there.

24:27.750 --> 24:30.042
That part
never made sense, though.

24:32.167 --> 24:33.917
It is strange, isn't it

24:34.000 --> 24:37.958
that you and I both know
that we are dying?

24:38.042 --> 24:39.583
Lorien gave you back your life

24:39.667 --> 24:43.292
but you still have
less than 20 years left.

24:43.375 --> 24:45.750
You know,
we're all dying, Londo

24:45.833 --> 24:49.417
20 years, 50 years,
100 years, doesn't matter.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.583
What matters is what we do
while we're waiting around

24:52.667 --> 24:55.583
how we live out
the seconds in between.

24:55.667 --> 24:56.958
Ah.

24:57.042 --> 24:58.333
Well, I have not done very well

24:58.417 --> 25:00.625
in that regard, have I?

25:00.708 --> 25:03.042
No, you haven't.

25:03.125 --> 25:06.417
People are not being
very charitable around here.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.000
There's a time for charity
and a time for truth.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.250
You're almost out of both.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.708
Sheridan.

25:14.792 --> 25:16.625
I..

25:16.708 --> 25:19.375
I don't want to die.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.042
Then turn around.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.958
- No.
- Turn around.

25:31.333 --> 25:34.542
I can't.
Don't you understand?

25:34.625 --> 25:36.167
I can't!

25:37.250 --> 25:38.667
Then you'll die.

25:39.917 --> 25:41.958
Goodbye, Londo.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.125
I'll see you soon.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.458
Wait. No.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.125
'Don't leave me here!'

25:50.833 --> 25:52.333
'No!'

25:52.417 --> 25:53.458
[beeping]

25:53.542 --> 25:54.750
Alright, talk to me.

25:54.833 --> 25:55.750
What's happening?

25:55.833 --> 25:56.792
His condition's deteriorating.

25:56.875 --> 25:57.792
His blood pressure's dropping

25:57.875 --> 25:59.083
his heart rate's unstable.

25:59.167 --> 26:01.750
Alright, 50 CCs
of Hydromorphozine.

26:01.833 --> 26:02.917
That could kill him.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.208
He is dead if we don't.
Now, let's go.

26:06.750 --> 26:07.917
Come on.

26:10.250 --> 26:12.500
[screaming]

26:13.458 --> 26:16.500
[screaming]

26:18.000 --> 26:19.083
Status?

26:19.167 --> 26:22.042
Uh, uh, heart rate's
stabilizing..

26:22.125 --> 26:23.333
...for now

26:23.417 --> 26:25.375
but his system
is under tremendous strain.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.000
He can't take much more of this.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.500
I know.

26:31.042 --> 26:32.708
I know.

26:35.208 --> 26:37.167
- Do you wanna get some rest?
- No.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.042
I can call you
if his condition changes.

26:39.125 --> 26:41.333
No, I couldn't sleep now,
anyway.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.667
It'll be morning in a few hours.

26:45.917 --> 26:49.000
Might as well stay here
and see what happens.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.375
(Vir)
A deathwatch?

26:55.750 --> 26:57.333
Maybe.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.208
We'll just have to wait and see.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.708
I don't want to die.

27:07.375 --> 27:10.500
Please, Great Maker.

27:10.583 --> 27:12.292
I don't want to die..

27:13.708 --> 27:15.875
...not like this, please.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.375
Not like this.

27:20.333 --> 27:21.625
You're afraid.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.292
Yes.

27:26.375 --> 27:28.208
Then don't die.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.375
Don't die.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.208
[groans]

27:34.292 --> 27:37.750
I don't think I have any choice
in the matter, Vir.

27:37.833 --> 27:40.875
[beeping]

27:43.875 --> 27:45.708
You do have a choice, Londo..

27:47.125 --> 27:50.542
...but you have to make it now.
There's not much time.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.000
What's wrong with me?

27:53.083 --> 27:55.250
What's wrong with you

27:55.333 --> 27:57.250
is you.

27:57.333 --> 28:01.583
Your heart can no longer bear
the weight of your conscience.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.250
There's nothing wrong
with my conscience.

28:04.333 --> 28:07.458
No? Then turn around.

28:12.042 --> 28:15.000
Why should I, hm?

28:15.083 --> 28:18.458
I saw my death in a dream.
I was an old man.

28:18.542 --> 28:20.417
How do I know
I won't survive this?

28:20.500 --> 28:24.417
Perhaps this will pass,
and I will get better.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.583
This dream is prophecy.

28:28.042 --> 28:30.792
Prophecy is a guess
that comes true.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.792
When it doesn't,
it's a metaphor.

28:33.875 --> 28:36.375
You could put a gun to your head
tomorrow and pull the trigger

28:36.458 --> 28:39.417
and then the dream
is just a dream

28:39.500 --> 28:42.417
and the prophecy
is just a metaphor..

28:42.500 --> 28:43.750
...and so are you.

28:45.250 --> 28:48.000
'You're out of time, Londo.
Turn around.'

28:49.500 --> 28:52.458
I can't. I don't know
what he wants from me.

28:52.542 --> 28:54.375
(Vir)
'Yes, you do.'

28:54.458 --> 28:56.292
The thing that has
eaten away at your heart

28:56.375 --> 28:59.833
until it could not endure
the pain a moment longer.

28:59.917 --> 29:01.500
You must let go of this

29:01.583 --> 29:04.542
or you will die here,
alone, now.

29:06.708 --> 29:07.917
Perhaps..

29:09.250 --> 29:11.375
Perhaps
that is for the best, then.

29:11.458 --> 29:15.125
No...not for the best.

29:16.792 --> 29:17.875
Why not?

29:19.167 --> 29:20.417
Because..

29:22.667 --> 29:24.458
...I will miss you.

29:26.417 --> 29:27.958
And I suppose..

29:29.458 --> 29:31.333
...that I would miss you.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.458
[dramatic music]

29:39.542 --> 29:41.667
I need a trauma team
in Medlab 1, stat!

29:41.750 --> 29:43.292
He's going into shock.
This could be it.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.292
[door opens]

29:46.375 --> 29:49.375
[beeping]

29:52.250 --> 29:55.625
Now, Mollari, now we end this.

29:58.667 --> 30:00.458
[groaning]

30:00.542 --> 30:05.500
[beeping]

30:05.583 --> 30:07.292
[Mollari groaning]

30:08.042 --> 30:10.833
[groaning]

30:16.875 --> 30:18.833
(G'Kar)
'You know this place,
don't you?'

30:20.958 --> 30:23.500
Yes.

30:23.583 --> 30:26.333
You think
this will be yours soon.

30:27.708 --> 30:29.250
I don't want it.

30:32.125 --> 30:34.708
Because of the dream
that you will die here?

30:34.792 --> 30:37.583
Because you know you're not
worthy of being called emperor?

30:37.667 --> 30:39.667
Because you are afraid
of failure?

30:39.750 --> 30:40.833
It doesn't matter.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.875
- Yes, it does.
- I don't want it!

30:42.958 --> 30:46.667
You don't deserve it!
That's the truth!

30:46.750 --> 30:48.333
That's what
you don't want to face.

30:48.417 --> 30:51.333
Look around, Mollari,
you look around!

30:53.417 --> 30:54.792
Do you remember?

30:56.375 --> 31:00.083
Ah, Mollari, I was just about
to send for you.

31:00.167 --> 31:01.375
Go ahead, gentlemen.

31:03.833 --> 31:06.375
- It's time to go.
- Go? Where?

31:06.458 --> 31:08.708
'To the Narn homeworld,
of course.'

31:10.083 --> 31:12.958
"To the Narn homeworld,
of course."

31:14.167 --> 31:16.750
You came with ships and guns

31:16.833 --> 31:18.125
and mass drivers.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.417
You plucked asteroids
out of near orbit

31:20.500 --> 31:22.792
and sent them plunging down
onto our cities

31:22.875 --> 31:24.708
killing men and women
and children

31:24.792 --> 31:27.542
onto the sick and the infirm
and the innocent!

31:27.625 --> 31:30.708
It was not my idea,
I didn't even know. It was Refa.

31:30.792 --> 31:33.208
It was not my fault. I said--

31:33.292 --> 31:36.333
You said...nothing.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.750
[explosion]

31:41.542 --> 31:43.250
You said nothing!

31:47.917 --> 31:52.750
You said...nothing!

31:57.708 --> 31:59.500
[panting]

31:59.583 --> 32:02.667
- Nothing.
- Leave me alone!

32:02.750 --> 32:05.667
- No. Look at me.
- I can't!

32:05.750 --> 32:07.292
Look at me.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.875
Do you remember this place?

32:17.917 --> 32:19.167
Yes.

32:19.250 --> 32:22.417
I was tortured in this place.
I was whipped.

32:24.417 --> 32:27.583
Emperor Cartagia
wanted to hear me scream.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.167
Yes, and if you did not scream

32:29.250 --> 32:31.917
the 40th stroke of the whip
would kill you

32:32.000 --> 32:35.083
'and your people
would be slaves forever. Yes.'

32:35.167 --> 32:36.208
You remember.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.625
- Yes.
- You were there!

32:39.708 --> 32:40.708
Yes!

32:42.292 --> 32:44.917
And you said..

32:46.750 --> 32:47.917
...nothing.

32:48.958 --> 32:50.708
(Cartagia)
'...thirty four'

32:50.792 --> 32:53.375
thirty five, thirty six..

32:54.625 --> 32:55.750
Nothing.

32:57.458 --> 33:00.042
...thirty seven, thirty eight..

33:01.417 --> 33:02.375
Nothing!

33:02.458 --> 33:04.583
...thirty nine..

33:04.667 --> 33:07.542
[screaming]

33:13.583 --> 33:15.250
One word, Mollari.

33:16.792 --> 33:20.292
One word was all
that was required of you.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.875
(Londo)
'It would not have mattered.'

33:21.958 --> 33:24.167
It wouldn't have changed
anything!

33:24.250 --> 33:27.000
- It would not have stopped!
- You're wrong, Mollari.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.125
Whether it was me or my world

33:29.208 --> 33:30.875
whether it was a total stranger

33:30.958 --> 33:34.750
or your worst enemy,
you were a witness!

33:34.833 --> 33:36.750
It doesn't matter
if they'd stop!

33:36.833 --> 33:38.625
It doesn't matter
if they'd listen!

33:38.708 --> 33:41.583
You had an obligation
to speak out!

33:41.667 --> 33:42.833
I couldn't!

33:42.917 --> 33:44.833
And that's why you don't deserve
to be emperor.

33:44.917 --> 33:47.583
[groans]

33:47.667 --> 33:49.958
That's why
you don't deserve to live.

33:53.292 --> 33:55.625
[groans]
No.

33:55.708 --> 33:59.792
'You're only moments away
from the grave, Mollari.'

33:59.875 --> 34:02.417
There must be
something I can do.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.583
Only a word was required of you

34:04.667 --> 34:06.875
the first time we stood here

34:06.958 --> 34:09.875
'and only a word
is required now.'

34:09.958 --> 34:12.167
No. No!

34:14.042 --> 34:15.125
[groaning]

34:17.042 --> 34:18.500
One word.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.333
I want..

34:22.500 --> 34:23.833
...to hear it.

34:29.542 --> 34:31.500
Oh, he's having a seizure.
Let's get him secured!

34:31.583 --> 34:32.833
Heart rate's
going through the roof!

34:32.917 --> 34:35.042
Alright, stand by.
We may have to defib.

34:35.125 --> 34:37.583
One..

34:37.667 --> 34:40.500
'...two, three..'

34:41.792 --> 34:43.167
...four..

34:43.250 --> 34:44.500
He's in full cardiac arrest!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.375
(Franklin)
'Alright, get ready to hit him!'

34:46.458 --> 34:49.250
...eight, nine..

34:50.917 --> 34:53.042
...ten, eleven..

34:54.083 --> 34:55.792
- Charging!
- Stand by!

34:55.875 --> 34:58.167
- Ready!
- Clear!

34:58.250 --> 35:00.250
...fifteen

35:00.333 --> 35:03.583
sixteen, seventeen..

35:04.375 --> 35:06.250
...eighteen..

35:06.333 --> 35:08.542
- Nothing! Ready!
- Clear!

35:09.625 --> 35:12.958
...twenty three, twenty four..

35:13.792 --> 35:15.417
...twenty five..

35:15.500 --> 35:17.375
Come on. Clear!

35:18.500 --> 35:19.625
...thirty..

35:20.542 --> 35:24.500
...thirty four, thirty five

35:24.583 --> 35:25.958
thirty six..

35:26.708 --> 35:27.875
Clear!

35:28.792 --> 35:30.208
...thirty eight..

35:30.917 --> 35:33.375
...thirty nine!

35:33.458 --> 35:36.458
[screaming]

35:40.250 --> 35:42.625
- Alright. I think we got him.
- Yeah, for now.

35:44.125 --> 35:46.292
Alright, you listen to me now.
Don't you do this to me.

35:46.375 --> 35:47.792
Don't you die on me.
You hear me?

35:47.875 --> 35:50.375
(Franklin)
Don't you die on me. Come on!

35:50.458 --> 35:52.792
I don't want to die.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.083
(G'Kar)
'Then don't.'

35:58.000 --> 35:59.375
Who are you?

36:01.292 --> 36:03.708
Perhaps I am a delusion

36:03.792 --> 36:06.250
caused by a lack of oxygen
to the brain.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.875
[sobbing]

36:09.000 --> 36:11.583
Perhaps I am the piece of myself

36:11.667 --> 36:15.292
that telepathically joined
with you once long ago

36:15.375 --> 36:17.125
and decided to stay.

36:17.208 --> 36:19.250
[sobbing]

36:19.333 --> 36:22.917
And perhaps
I am your conscience..

36:24.250 --> 36:25.917
...which can only
get your attention

36:26.000 --> 36:29.333
by taking on a face
other than your own

36:29.417 --> 36:32.083
and striking you down
in the one place

36:32.167 --> 36:34.667
where you are still
vulnerable.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.458
Why?

36:37.833 --> 36:40.292
Why are you doing this to me?

36:41.792 --> 36:44.625
You want to believe
you've changed.

36:44.708 --> 36:47.292
You want to feel good
about yourself.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.958
You're not sorry
for what you did!

36:52.042 --> 36:54.458
You're just sorry
that you got caught

36:54.542 --> 36:58.333
that you almost destroyed
your homeworld because of it.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.792
- That's not true.
- Well, then prove it.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.333
[sobs]

37:03.417 --> 37:05.292
'Just a word, Mollari.'

37:06.292 --> 37:08.125
'That's all it takes.'

37:13.250 --> 37:15.625
I've never apologized

37:15.708 --> 37:17.625
for anything in my life.

37:17.708 --> 37:20.708
[beeping]

37:23.292 --> 37:26.167
Yes. So I see.

37:30.708 --> 37:34.083
It's your life, Mollari.

37:34.167 --> 37:36.417
Make of it what you will.

37:36.500 --> 37:39.542
[sobbing]

37:45.833 --> 37:48.417
[banging]

37:48.500 --> 37:51.875
[sobbing]
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:51.958 --> 37:53.958
I'm sorry..

37:55.083 --> 37:56.917
I am sorry.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.708
I'm sorry!

38:00.917 --> 38:03.500
[beeping]

38:03.583 --> 38:05.792
- 'I think so.'
- 'It's his stomach..'

38:05.875 --> 38:07.250
Condition stabilizing.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.125
We're getting normal operation
of the left heart.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.750
Good, good.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.500
That's it.

38:18.583 --> 38:20.333
Looking good.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.667
Looking good.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.875
G'Kar.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.125
Sorry.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.333
I'm sorry.

38:47.333 --> 38:48.708
G'Kar.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.625
'I'm sorry.'

39:02.500 --> 39:05.542
[indistinct chattering]

39:14.833 --> 39:17.208
They call this food?

39:17.292 --> 39:19.542
Even a Pak'ma'ra
wouldn't eat this.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.750
Londo, the doctor said--

39:20.833 --> 39:23.583
I know what the doctor said.

39:23.667 --> 39:26.750
It was my heart
that betrayed me, not my ears.

39:26.833 --> 39:28.917
You are going to have
to change your diet, Londo

39:29.000 --> 39:31.417
and you are gonna have
to cut back on the stress!

39:31.500 --> 39:33.583
Yes, well,
that doesn't seem very likely

39:33.667 --> 39:36.083
as long as I am still here, yes?

39:36.167 --> 39:38.125
And if I go home,
there is even more stress.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.208
So there you are.

39:40.292 --> 39:43.208
No, Vir, the universe
is an evil place

39:43.292 --> 39:45.250
but at least it seems
to have a sense of humor

39:45.333 --> 39:46.625
about the whole thing.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.417
Well, I suppose
I should let you rest now.

39:52.042 --> 39:55.333
Oh, Vir, before you go..

39:55.417 --> 39:57.542
I was doing some reading
and I, I wondered

39:57.625 --> 39:59.792
if you had
ever heard about this.

39:59.875 --> 40:04.333
Apparently, according
to some of our folktales

40:04.417 --> 40:07.667
if the spirit of a Centauri
ends up in a body

40:07.750 --> 40:09.917
that is not worthy
of its presence

40:10.000 --> 40:12.458
it can choose to separate

40:12.542 --> 40:14.458
to, to cause
the death of the body

40:14.542 --> 40:16.667
so that it can then move on

40:16.750 --> 40:18.625
to a worthier host.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.125
Right.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.958
Right, I-I-I remember that.

40:22.042 --> 40:24.750
It's, it's a very big struggle

40:24.833 --> 40:26.500
a-and apparently,
the person involved

40:26.583 --> 40:29.250
is either permanently changed
by the experience

40:29.333 --> 40:30.583
or he dies.

40:30.667 --> 40:32.333
'Of course, this is
only supposed to happen'

40:32.417 --> 40:36.000
when the higher spirit
is a real, real high one.

40:36.083 --> 40:39.542
I mean, we're talking
major angelic here.

40:39.625 --> 40:42.625
A-and, and the person
that it's stuck inside

40:42.708 --> 40:45.375
is a complete monster.

40:45.458 --> 40:48.750
I mean, just nasty and corrupt

40:48.833 --> 40:50.417
and disgusting. It's..

40:53.792 --> 40:55.667
N-not that I was..

40:55.750 --> 40:58.167
Because obviously, you are..

40:58.250 --> 41:00.375
You know, you know,
I really have to go.

41:04.292 --> 41:06.250
To your question.

41:06.333 --> 41:10.042
Yes, I do remember that story.

41:10.125 --> 41:12.500
I heard it
ever since I was a child.

41:14.042 --> 41:15.375
Interesting.

41:16.542 --> 41:17.917
I didn't.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.500
Not even a goodbye, Lennier?

42:00.500 --> 42:02.125
No.

42:02.208 --> 42:03.458
Never goodbye.

42:05.125 --> 42:07.542
I'm yours forever, Delenn

42:07.625 --> 42:10.833
'heart, body and soul.'

42:12.125 --> 42:15.000
I will see you again
in a little while.

42:15.083 --> 42:16.542
And with luck..

42:16.625 --> 42:18.833
...I will perhaps
be a better person.

42:21.333 --> 42:23.500
That is not possible, Lennier..

42:24.667 --> 42:26.583
...but you're welcome to try.

42:33.917 --> 42:35.125
Be well..

42:36.375 --> 42:39.000
...my good and dear friend.

42:40.417 --> 42:41.583
And you.
