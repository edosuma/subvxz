WEBVTT

00:10.325 --> 00:11.793
- May I help you?
- Yes, sir.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.928
I need to speak with Mr. Atugu,
please.

00:14.095 --> 00:15.392
What's this about?

00:15.563 --> 00:18.163
The president of your country
is going to be murdered in 24 hours.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.090
Check him.

00:50.765 --> 00:52.199
He specifically requested you.

00:52.367 --> 00:53.857
Sounds like a hoax. Who is he?

00:54.035 --> 00:55.093
No ID, no weapons.

00:55.270 --> 00:57.329
I say we wait, call Malabo for orders.

00:57.505 --> 00:59.940
In America, I give the orders.

01:07.582 --> 01:08.947
Well, then,

01:09.717 --> 01:12.516
you know something
about an alleged coup d'état?

01:16.691 --> 01:18.318
He, uh...

01:20.495 --> 01:21.553
He says goodbye.

01:22.096 --> 01:24.224
Pardon me?

01:24.732 --> 01:26.632
- Mr. Atugu, there is...
- Not now.

01:29.137 --> 01:30.730
Who says goodbye?

01:33.007 --> 01:34.236
Tuhon.

02:20.088 --> 02:21.817
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:33.635 --> 02:36.627
- What's up?
- You really gonna play it like this?

02:36.804 --> 02:40.866
Last night, Joelle,
dirty martini, that dress?

02:41.042 --> 02:42.203
Oh, Joelle.

02:42.377 --> 02:43.538
She's world-class, G.

02:43.711 --> 02:46.442
Eh, national level, maybe.
Regional, for sure.

02:46.614 --> 02:48.082
She's an undisputed ten.

02:48.249 --> 02:50.047
- Come on.
- I didn't say she wasn't hot.

02:50.218 --> 02:53.153
- But she's not a ten?
- A solid nine.

02:53.554 --> 02:56.274
That magically appeared into your life
without you making any effort.

02:56.491 --> 02:58.391
- So?
- So that "no effort” thing should count

02:58.559 --> 02:59.651
for at least one point.

02:59.827 --> 03:01.625
She's more your type than mine.

03:01.796 --> 03:03.230
So, what's wrong with my type?

03:03.398 --> 03:04.991
Nothing. I love your type.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.806
Your taste is great.
Michelle is the best.

03:06.934 --> 03:10.427
Ah. Don't think, just react.
Scale of one to ten. Go.

03:10.605 --> 03:12.232
Eight.

03:13.341 --> 03:15.241
Nine.

03:15.843 --> 03:18.210
Look closely. Hmm?

03:18.379 --> 03:20.746
- Ten. Aten. She's a ten. She's hot.
- Ha, ha.

03:20.915 --> 03:23.316
- Thank you. Yeah.
- All day, it's a ten. All day.

03:23.484 --> 03:25.782
- I know. Yeah.
- That's a stone-cold fox right there.

03:26.321 --> 03:27.379
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.087
Well, that's interesting.

03:30.258 --> 03:32.158
It's Joelle.

03:33.027 --> 03:34.051
She's texting you?

03:34.228 --> 03:36.856
I asked her to rate last night
from a scale of one to ten.

03:37.031 --> 03:38.692
And?

03:44.072 --> 03:45.301
Am I interrupting something?

03:46.074 --> 03:49.476
That was, of course,
a rhetorical question.

03:50.511 --> 03:52.240
Let's go to Ops, lover boy.

03:55.817 --> 03:58.548
Ah. Headshrink on deck.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.119
- He must be here for Deeks.
- No.

04:00.288 --> 04:02.569
Actually, Hetty pulled me off
my deployment for this case.

04:03.057 --> 04:04.081
Where were you deployed?

04:04.258 --> 04:06.522
Well, I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

04:06.694 --> 04:09.891
Oh, he has been waiting his whole life
to say that to someone.

04:10.064 --> 04:11.793
Well, I'd try to kill you.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.640
Probably unsuccessfully.
In which case, you'd have to kill me.

04:14.769 --> 04:16.849
Then you'd never know
where Hetty brought me in from.

04:17.004 --> 04:18.028
Which is the whole point.

04:18.406 --> 04:19.635
Why are you here, Nate?

04:19.807 --> 04:22.071
It's better if I just show you.

04:23.211 --> 04:25.475
This happened
at Equatorial Guinea's consulate

04:25.646 --> 04:27.546
in Los Angeles this morning.

04:27.715 --> 04:29.774
The three victims: Leonard Atugu...

04:29.951 --> 04:32.818
He's a diplomatic envoy
to the United States.

04:32.987 --> 04:35.217
And the two security guards.

04:35.390 --> 04:37.154
Get this,
the murder weapon is a T-shirt

04:37.325 --> 04:38.805
and two batteries
from the wall clock.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.800
He didn't mind the security pat-down,
because he knows how to improvise.

04:41.929 --> 04:43.489
You thought
Colonel Mustard in the study

04:43.631 --> 04:45.531
with a candlestick was a badass.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.635
Play it with the audio, Eric,
from earlier.

04:48.803 --> 04:50.601
Who says goodbye?

04:51.506 --> 04:52.996
Tuhon.

04:55.076 --> 04:56.908
Who's Tuhon?

04:57.445 --> 04:59.038
Anyone can say a hame.

04:59.213 --> 05:01.375
Saying that name
has consequences.

05:02.216 --> 05:04.878
Killer's too good to get caught
on camera by accident.

05:05.052 --> 05:06.247
What do we know about him?

05:06.421 --> 05:09.391
He's still missing.
His name's Michael Santos.

05:09.557 --> 05:13.687
He's a U.S. citizen suspected
of several contract killings since 2010.

05:13.861 --> 05:16.387
Let's take a closer look, shall we?

05:18.199 --> 05:19.564
Check out his ink.

05:19.734 --> 05:22.726
A bikking tattoo. Tribal.

05:23.337 --> 05:27.365
Specific to the Kalinga headhunters
from the northern Philippines.

05:27.542 --> 05:30.876
Yeah, that's not the kind of ink
you pick up on Hollywood Boulevard.

05:31.579 --> 05:34.605
There's one Kalinga headhunter left
in the world.

05:34.982 --> 05:36.211
We know him.

05:36.717 --> 05:38.879
Man named Tuhon.

05:39.887 --> 05:42.083
It was our first case together.

05:43.357 --> 05:45.052
That's why Hetty brought you in.

05:45.426 --> 05:47.292
She's waiting for you.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.222
Killer's a professional,
but he did everything on camera.

05:51.399 --> 05:52.764
Tuhon wanted to be seen.

05:52.934 --> 05:54.732
He made us a promise, Hetty.

05:54.902 --> 05:58.236
Said he was retired for good.
No more hits. No more killing.

05:58.406 --> 06:01.432
No one ever truly knows a man
like this.

06:01.809 --> 06:04.972
People say about Tuhon
that he won't smile at you

06:05.146 --> 06:09.174
until he's figured out exactly
how you're going to die.

06:10.351 --> 06:11.648
He ever smile at you?

06:14.021 --> 06:16.490
I smiled back.

06:18.526 --> 06:21.757
Tuhon was Hetty's weapon of choice
for wetwork ops during the Cold War.

06:21.929 --> 06:25.092
Which is the CIA's polite way of saying
"assassinations."

06:25.266 --> 06:27.360
Isn't this where we get a photo
on the big screen?

06:27.535 --> 06:30.368
Some sort of mug shot or secret file,
surveillance pic?

06:30.538 --> 06:32.666
Something to give a human face
to this guy?

06:32.840 --> 06:34.330
No one has any photos of him.

06:34.509 --> 06:35.704
Tuhon's the type of patriot

06:35.877 --> 06:37.597
that doesn't make it
into the history books.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.840
His file was permanently wiped
in 2007.

06:41.015 --> 06:42.278
No backups exist.

06:42.683 --> 06:43.946
Wiped by who?

06:45.119 --> 06:46.678
Hetty.

06:46.854 --> 06:48.583
Tuhon's guys don't get caught
on camera.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.885
Yeah, and they definitely don't say his
name in a room that's wired for audio.

06:52.059 --> 06:54.494
Unless he's sending a message.

06:55.396 --> 06:56.886
He's gonna know we're coming.

06:57.431 --> 06:59.798
Tuhon hasn't seen us
for seven years.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.530
We've evolved.

07:03.004 --> 07:05.200
He's evolved too.

07:05.373 --> 07:08.900
In 2007 mercenaries tried
to overthrow Equatorial Guinea.

07:09.076 --> 07:11.670
The same Equatorial Guinea
that lost a diplomat this morning.

07:11.846 --> 07:15.373
Mm-hm. Oil rich, terrible
human-rights record, unstable regime.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.917
Tuhon led the coup, but it failed.

07:18.085 --> 07:20.417
Someone betrayed him
from the inside.

07:20.588 --> 07:24.650
He was too old to run.
No one to trust except Hetty.

07:24.825 --> 07:27.419
The first agent she sent in
to rescue him

07:27.595 --> 07:28.892
was killed within 24 hours.

07:29.063 --> 07:32.226
The next two agents Hetty sent in
were strangers.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.368
Callen and Sam.

07:34.535 --> 07:36.799
We extracted him
from Equatorial Guinea in '07.

07:36.971 --> 07:39.406
Our intel's had him in Mexico City
ever since.

07:39.574 --> 07:42.168
Yeah, he's retired. He's managing
some underground bar there.

07:42.343 --> 07:43.367
We'll find him.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.542
If he's innocent, bring him in.

07:47.081 --> 07:48.378
And if he isn't?

07:50.418 --> 07:52.011
Act accordingly.

08:00.127 --> 08:02.061
Hetty is sending Sam and Callen
to Mexico City.

08:02.229 --> 08:04.669
I'm gonna go to the EG consulate,
talk to whoever's in charge.

08:04.799 --> 08:06.927
Atugu was targeted for a reason.
We gotta know why.

08:07.101 --> 08:09.229
The killer's still out there.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.797
The hotel hasn't changed since
we crashed here seven years ago.

08:46.974 --> 08:49.500
- Still the slowest elevator in Mexico.
- Yeah.

08:50.277 --> 08:52.177
We won't have to stay here too long.

08:52.346 --> 08:54.610
Our old asset's in play.

08:55.182 --> 08:57.514
The same asset from 2007?

08:57.685 --> 08:59.346
We make a strong impression.

09:01.789 --> 09:05.248
I remember it took me a week
to figure out what to call you. Heh.

09:05.426 --> 09:08.953
Callen, G., G. Callen, G.C.

09:09.130 --> 09:10.650
Thought Hetty was playing a joke
on me.

09:10.798 --> 09:12.266
Don't apologize.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.595
Took me a week
to stop calling you Teddy.

09:14.969 --> 09:17.129
- Who was Teddy?
- I don't know. You look like a Teddy.

09:17.271 --> 09:20.138
- I look like a Teddy. Yeah, right, okay.
- Ha, ha.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.934
You remember what Tuhon
used to call you?

09:24.245 --> 09:26.043
"Tyrant with a Trident."

09:26.547 --> 09:29.517
- I was "The Tribe of One."
- Yeah.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.976
Back then, he was right.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.779
Well, maybe he's innocent.

09:36.157 --> 09:38.592
Maybe it'll be just like the old days.

09:39.894 --> 09:41.384
Maybe.

10:22.336 --> 10:24.236
Kalinga tattoos.

10:24.405 --> 10:25.600
Tuhon's men.

10:25.773 --> 10:28.140
Just like the good old days.

10:38.651 --> 10:41.348
So, Hetty, Equatorial Guinea's
consulate's on foreign soil.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.000
So if I roll in there asking questions
about a triple homicide,

10:44.156 --> 10:46.056
they're just gonna slam the door
in my face.

10:46.726 --> 10:48.490
They'll welcome you
with open arms.

10:48.661 --> 10:51.653
You are not going alone, my friend.

10:52.064 --> 10:54.533
Wow. That is a lot of plaid.

10:55.034 --> 10:57.696
- Houndstooth. It... It's houndstooth.
- Mm-hm.

10:57.870 --> 11:00.464
It's enough to give me a seizure.
What's your plan here, huh?

11:00.639 --> 11:02.599
You gonna blind security
while I sprint past them?

11:02.742 --> 11:04.801
Dr. Nathan Getz, special assistant

11:04.977 --> 11:07.297
to the undersecretary of foreign affairs,
State Department.

11:07.446 --> 11:09.437
- Yah.
- Why are you looking terrified?

11:09.615 --> 11:11.879
I feel like I'm about to be swallowed
by a giant kilt.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.816
Oh, drop the fabric phobia, Mr. Deeks,

11:14.987 --> 11:18.321
and find out why Atugu was killed.

11:18.824 --> 11:20.849
With Downton Abbey over here?

11:21.026 --> 11:23.051
You watch it too. Come on.

11:24.296 --> 11:26.390
- So how's Kensi?
- Well, she's not lonely.

11:26.565 --> 11:28.499
She's got Granger, Sabatino,
a whole crew.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.691
That sounds like fun.

11:29.869 --> 11:32.167
Yeah, except for she doesn't trust
any of them.

11:41.647 --> 11:43.411
What are we looking at?

11:43.649 --> 11:46.118
- Just a map of the area.
- Mm.

11:46.519 --> 11:47.850
No.

11:49.422 --> 11:51.857
- Do you know the region?
- Yeah, I've worked it.

11:52.024 --> 11:53.719
Did you make any contacts or...?

11:53.893 --> 11:55.122
Not really.

11:55.828 --> 11:57.796
What does "not really" mean?

11:58.697 --> 12:01.359
It means any contacts I made
are not really worth talking about.

12:04.837 --> 12:06.896
Know what? Pack your gear.

12:07.072 --> 12:09.598
- Why?
- We're going dancing.

12:09.775 --> 12:10.799
Heh.

12:10.976 --> 12:13.536
No. We got a lead
on some movement.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.037
Where?

12:15.614 --> 12:17.742
I'll show you when we get there.

12:18.784 --> 12:21.754
You said you were a good tracker,
right?

12:21.921 --> 12:23.252
Yes, I did.

12:23.923 --> 12:26.255
Good. Let's roll.

12:30.129 --> 12:32.325
There's no surveillance. We're clean.

12:32.731 --> 12:34.563
Sisters really did well
for themselves.

12:34.733 --> 12:37.100
Invested their beauty-pageant
winnings wisely.

12:37.269 --> 12:40.432
- Martina knows where Tuhon is?
- We gotta work up to that. Slowly.

12:40.606 --> 12:42.335
If she doesn't know, Rita will.

12:42.741 --> 12:44.300
Wait a second.

12:44.477 --> 12:46.275
Rita's in here?

12:46.445 --> 12:48.812
It says "Dos Hermanas Salon."
Two Sisters Salon.

12:48.981 --> 12:51.746
- What do you think?
- I think Rita's the crazy sister.

12:51.917 --> 12:54.249
More your type than mine.

13:01.293 --> 13:02.385
Guess who's back.

13:03.762 --> 13:05.161
Teddy.

13:11.437 --> 13:13.428
You're so beautiful.

13:17.943 --> 13:21.004
Rita, I can explain.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.478
Explain what? Hmm?

13:23.649 --> 13:26.949
You said you were gonna take me
to the Jamaican Riviera

13:27.119 --> 13:28.951
on your yacht with Teddy.

13:29.121 --> 13:31.001
Did I really say there was a Riviera
in Jamaica?

13:31.156 --> 13:33.716
But I guess Sefior Carl
has Miss Universes lined up for dates,

13:33.893 --> 13:36.794
- since you vanished on me like that.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

13:36.962 --> 13:41.490
But Sefior Carl
came back for you, baby.

13:42.868 --> 13:44.233
For you.

13:48.374 --> 13:51.400
Rita said she was gonna murder
your buddy right here in our salon.

13:51.577 --> 13:53.417
Oh, yeah?
You shouldn't have kept that from me.

13:53.579 --> 13:56.708
Shouldn't have waited seven years
to come back.

14:06.492 --> 14:08.483
Last time I helped you and Sefior Carl,

14:08.661 --> 14:11.255
lots of dead bodies got left behind.
Lots of danger for me.

14:11.430 --> 14:15.196
I promise you,
when this is over, we'll go out with Rita,

14:15.367 --> 14:17.631
we'll get the yacht,
just like we always talked about.

14:17.803 --> 14:21.000
Caught her trying to Google the
Jamaican Riviera just the other day.

14:21.173 --> 14:24.074
Still don't have the heart
to tell her the truth.

14:25.511 --> 14:27.104
What does Teddy need?

14:27.580 --> 14:29.446
Teddy needs to see Tuhon.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.915
Ah! I told you he'd come back for me.

14:33.085 --> 14:34.314
See that?

14:34.587 --> 14:35.679
How's Teddy?

14:35.854 --> 14:37.049
Scale of one to ten.

14:37.222 --> 14:39.486
We're about to find out.

14:39.658 --> 14:42.252
Every man in this city
spends his life avoiding Tuhon,

14:42.428 --> 14:44.260
and you wanna waltz up
to his front door?

14:44.430 --> 14:45.955
Yeah.

14:47.433 --> 14:48.832
Better be some yacht you got.

14:49.001 --> 14:51.231
Oh, baby, you're gonna love this yacht,
believe me.

14:52.605 --> 14:56.098
Tell her about the yacht.
It's unbelievable. Trust me.

14:56.508 --> 15:00.536
Has the undersecretary considered
the prime minister's proposal?

15:01.513 --> 15:02.537
Uh, proposal?

15:03.115 --> 15:04.276
Of course.

15:06.285 --> 15:08.447
Why would someone
want Atugu dead?

15:08.621 --> 15:10.453
First we discuss the proposal.

15:10.623 --> 15:12.455
- In detail.
- Detail.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.784
I'm waiting, Dr. Getz.

15:17.296 --> 15:21.597
Well, let's talk about your country's
military budget from last year.

15:21.767 --> 15:28.104
The $152,998,324 you spent last year
just won't cut it.

15:28.474 --> 15:30.306
A little foreign aid might help.

15:30.476 --> 15:33.468
Maybe even
some American-made hardware.

15:35.681 --> 15:40.016
It takes a dapper man
to pull off plaid, Dr. Getz.

15:40.185 --> 15:42.085
- It's houndstooth.
- Houndstooth.

15:42.254 --> 15:44.484
And first
you answer the questions about Atugu.

15:44.657 --> 15:48.958
He had enemies,
especially after the failed coup in 2007.

15:49.128 --> 15:50.152
And why is that?

15:50.329 --> 15:52.730
Some say he worked
with the mercenaries,

15:52.898 --> 15:56.163
until he betrayed them to our president
at the 11th hour.

15:56.535 --> 16:01.974
It's rumored that Atugu's reward
was this diplomatic post.

16:02.808 --> 16:05.800
You think Tuhon and his merc buddies
are the type to hold a grudge?

16:09.181 --> 16:12.640
Well, the story about
Atugu's big promotion checks out.

16:12.818 --> 16:16.777
After the coup fell apart, he went
from errand boy to diplomat overnight.

16:16.955 --> 16:19.481
Huh. He sold Tuhon for a better deal.

16:19.792 --> 16:21.954
Why wait seven years for revenge?

16:22.127 --> 16:23.686
I don't know.

16:24.430 --> 16:27.092
Okay, so Tuhon escaped,
but not all of his men did.

16:27.266 --> 16:28.290
Most were killed.

16:28.467 --> 16:29.593
One was taken alive:

16:29.768 --> 16:32.294
South African merc Steven Carter.

16:32.471 --> 16:35.372
Hmm. Ex-military
turned private contractor.

16:35.541 --> 16:37.381
Sentenced to seven years
at Black Beach prison.

16:37.543 --> 16:40.410
Yeah, Black Beach
is the worst prison in Africa.

16:40.746 --> 16:42.680
Well, Carter did not have it easy.

16:42.848 --> 16:46.580
Torture, dehydration,
bout with cerebral malaria.

16:46.752 --> 16:49.153
Tuhon and his men
tried to break Carter out of prison twice

16:49.321 --> 16:52.347
before a run-in with the military
had them flee the country.

16:52.858 --> 16:55.054
According to this,
he was released six months ago.

16:55.227 --> 16:58.253
So where's Carter now?

16:58.464 --> 17:00.296
Time to find out.

17:19.050 --> 17:20.382
Tuhon made that for you.

17:20.819 --> 17:23.083
Oh, a lifetime ago.

17:23.622 --> 17:24.782
You care about him.

17:30.062 --> 17:32.997
You didn't bring me out here
just to be Deeks' partner, did you?

17:33.165 --> 17:35.793
We're spread a little thin here
at the moment,

17:35.968 --> 17:40.201
with Callen and Sam in Mexico
and Kensi in Afghanistan.

17:41.006 --> 17:45.307
No one can be a tribe of one.

17:45.477 --> 17:47.411
Not even me.

17:50.682 --> 17:52.650
And you're worried
about how this ends.

17:53.485 --> 17:57.149
It can only end one way.

17:59.691 --> 18:03.252
How we get there is the question.

18:07.132 --> 18:08.930
What is this?

18:10.169 --> 18:12.399
Well, can't look like tourists
where we're going.

18:13.038 --> 18:14.164
Only the two of us?

18:14.339 --> 18:16.467
Yeah, just a happy couple
out for a ride, right?

18:18.043 --> 18:20.808
Let me guess, you gotta pee
one more time before we leave.

18:21.213 --> 18:22.806
No, I'm fine.

18:24.483 --> 18:25.814
Can't go looking like that.

18:25.984 --> 18:27.349
Gotta cover that head.

18:40.766 --> 18:42.325
Happy?

18:42.534 --> 18:44.195
I can see the appeal.

18:44.369 --> 18:45.734
Bite me.

18:48.807 --> 18:50.434
This is it.

18:50.742 --> 18:52.836
You really want to go in there?

18:53.345 --> 18:54.938
No security cameras.

18:55.113 --> 18:57.673
No secondary security perimeter.

18:57.850 --> 18:59.545
You know what we're gonna do?

18:59.718 --> 19:02.187
We're gonna make this
like a little surprise party, huh?

19:02.354 --> 19:03.879
- All right?
- Sefior Carl's trying

19:04.056 --> 19:05.976
- to make it a party, baby.
- That's right, baby.

19:06.124 --> 19:07.523
Surprise reunion.

19:07.693 --> 19:09.218
Like the good old days.

19:15.868 --> 19:18.235
Well, I guess the years
really have changed you, huh?

19:18.403 --> 19:19.768
They change all of us.

19:19.938 --> 19:20.962
Your weapons.

19:21.607 --> 19:23.166
Okay.

20:25.537 --> 20:27.437
Now it's a party.

20:40.818 --> 20:43.446
Damn! Let me try again.

20:43.621 --> 20:45.646
Give Mack another chance, right?

20:50.828 --> 20:52.455
I'm ready.

20:54.098 --> 20:57.591
Okay, now, the minute you see
my hand move, grab your money.

20:57.768 --> 21:01.261
- You're closer, younger and faster.
- Yeah, I know how it works.

21:03.607 --> 21:05.473
Go. Ugh!

21:09.246 --> 21:11.271
You really thought
I was gonna kill you?

21:11.449 --> 21:13.417
The thought had occurred to us.

21:15.286 --> 21:17.345
Heard you guys
had an elevator problem.

21:17.788 --> 21:19.347
Your guys had the problem.

21:19.924 --> 21:21.790
Told this tribe
to stay clear of you two.

21:21.959 --> 21:22.983
That's the truth.

21:23.594 --> 21:25.460
Then this tribe is getting weak.

21:25.930 --> 21:27.762
Not weak, just poor.

21:27.932 --> 21:29.093
You know, I retired.

21:29.266 --> 21:32.600
Running this place
doesn't pay like my last trade.

21:33.004 --> 21:36.304
The two guys you busted up
saw two feds,

21:36.474 --> 21:37.942
thought they could get some ransom.

21:38.509 --> 21:40.477
What about the murdered diplomat
in LA?

21:41.278 --> 21:42.609
Killer set me up.

21:42.913 --> 21:44.472
Why should we believe you?

21:45.416 --> 21:47.612
Thoughts, words, deeds.

21:48.019 --> 21:50.386
His name is Michael Santos.

21:50.554 --> 21:55.515
He's crashing at the Marquee Motel
in North Hollywood.

21:56.460 --> 21:58.087
Call it in.

22:06.303 --> 22:07.737
Callen, what's up?

22:07.905 --> 22:11.239
Eric. I think I got a lead for us.

22:13.377 --> 22:15.368
Only a matter of time
before Santos shows.

22:15.546 --> 22:16.980
Man, I don't like this.

22:17.448 --> 22:18.938
Oh, right.

22:19.116 --> 22:21.608
You're here in L.A.
and Kensi's all the way in Afghanistan

22:21.786 --> 22:23.550
doing who knows what
with who knows who.

22:23.721 --> 22:26.315
Why does everyone assume
I'm always thinking about Kensi?

22:26.490 --> 22:27.753
You're fondling her knife.

22:31.429 --> 22:32.863
It's the op I don't like.

22:33.030 --> 22:35.931
You know, acting on a tip from Tuhon,
a.k.a. Darth Vader.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.432
Stalking on a psycho
who's capable of killing people

22:38.602 --> 22:41.663
- with Fruit of the Loom products.
- Well, when you put it like that...

22:41.839 --> 22:43.568
Everybody's gotta go
at some point, right?

22:43.741 --> 22:46.904
I just don't want my cause of death
to be another man's underwear.

22:47.611 --> 22:50.205
There he is.
Santos, our underwear assassin.

22:50.381 --> 22:51.906
Let's do it.

22:55.519 --> 22:57.078
Federal agents! On your knees!

22:57.521 --> 22:58.784
On your knees!

22:58.956 --> 23:00.446
Put your hands behind your head!

23:06.464 --> 23:08.364
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:08.532 --> 23:10.398
He's alive, but he's bleeding out fast.

23:12.570 --> 23:14.902
Remember Steven Carter,
our South African merc?

23:15.072 --> 23:16.597
Yeah, Tuhon's old cohort.

23:16.774 --> 23:18.538
- Fresh out of Black Beach prison.
- Yeah.

23:18.709 --> 23:21.235
Well, he flew from Johannesburg
to LAX a week ago.

23:21.679 --> 23:22.805
One-way ticket.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.449
Could be in town
to settle some old debts.

23:25.616 --> 23:27.380
You think he's working with Tuhon?

23:30.121 --> 23:31.589
Needs surgery, but he's gonna live.

23:31.755 --> 23:33.154
When can we question him?

23:33.324 --> 23:35.725
Not until doctors work on him
and the drugs wear off.

23:35.893 --> 23:37.224
Deeks.

23:38.529 --> 23:40.258
That tattoo is fake.

23:40.431 --> 23:41.899
He's not one of Tuhon's guys.

23:44.969 --> 23:45.993
Yeah.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.604
Not the real deal.

23:47.771 --> 23:49.034
All right, thanks, Eric.

23:51.375 --> 23:53.935
Killer's tattoos were fake.

23:54.411 --> 23:57.278
He wanted us to think
he was part of Tuhon's crew.

23:57.448 --> 23:59.568
Which means that everything
that came out of his mouth

23:59.717 --> 24:01.811
at the consulate was part of the act.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.286
A South African merc
named Steven Carter

24:05.456 --> 24:07.356
was just released
from Black Beach prison.

24:07.525 --> 24:09.926
- He's in L.A.
- Ask Santos about Carter.

24:10.094 --> 24:12.825
We can't. He's in surgery.

24:12.997 --> 24:16.627
Carter wanted
Equatorial Guinea's oil money in '07.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.063
Still wants it.

24:18.235 --> 24:19.600
Can't get it without me.

24:19.770 --> 24:21.169
Why you?

24:21.338 --> 24:22.999
Plenty of killers for hire out there.

24:23.507 --> 24:24.941
Is that all I am?

24:25.109 --> 24:29.046
Someone who can walk into this bar,
kill every man in it?

24:29.747 --> 24:31.545
Or maybe that's not me at all.

24:31.849 --> 24:35.649
Maybe I'm someone who can,
uh, make sure

24:35.819 --> 24:39.449
that every man in this bar is dead
before I ever walk through the door.

24:40.424 --> 24:42.586
All I see around us
are guys with guns and blades.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.058
Yeah, alive and well.

24:45.496 --> 24:47.191
And a lot of them.

24:48.432 --> 24:50.298
They're all dead.

24:50.734 --> 24:53.863
They're just waiting to tell us
how they wanna go.

24:54.672 --> 24:56.197
What do you want, Tuhon?

24:57.575 --> 24:59.566
I wanna hang out with Hetty.

24:59.743 --> 25:03.873
Heh. Well, that means
working with NCIS

25:04.748 --> 25:06.580
and taking down this Carter guy.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.479
You gotta clear your name.

25:08.652 --> 25:12.418
Show us that you kept your promise
to stay retired.

25:14.892 --> 25:17.520
Yeah, I still got my glass heels.

25:17.895 --> 25:19.215
I can do the dance one more time.

25:20.998 --> 25:24.366
I was hoping that you'd come
to your senses, Tuhon.

25:24.535 --> 25:25.661
It's too bad.

25:26.003 --> 25:27.835
Tribe ain't what it used to be.

25:28.005 --> 25:29.370
No.

25:29.540 --> 25:32.942
You guys have been kicking ass
for seven years.

25:33.611 --> 25:35.272
My tribe's never been stronger.

25:35.446 --> 25:36.914
So who are these guys in the bar?

25:37.081 --> 25:39.448
Just a story we'll tell someday.

25:40.584 --> 25:42.882
Weapons on the table.

25:46.490 --> 25:48.117
You on Carter's payroll now?

25:48.292 --> 25:50.522
There's a lot of money
in Equatorial Guinea.

25:50.694 --> 25:53.129
We were hoping that you'd wake up,
get back in the game.

25:53.297 --> 25:56.733
Carter said to be patient,
give you a chance.

25:56.900 --> 25:58.891
Unless you sided with the feds.

26:00.537 --> 26:02.232
Look at you.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.100
Looking at my maniwat.

26:08.879 --> 26:11.041
Like it's already yours.

27:04.802 --> 27:06.861
Guess Mack gets the trick now.

27:07.471 --> 27:09.997
It's a hell of a story so far.

27:11.041 --> 27:13.135
Can't wait to see how it ends.

27:28.023 --> 27:31.459
So where do we stand?

27:32.361 --> 27:34.830
Callen, Sam and Tuhon
made it out of Mexico.

27:34.997 --> 27:38.831
They landed in L.A. an hour ago
and they're on the move.

27:39.001 --> 27:41.402
Unfortunately,
an anonymous source called the FBI

27:41.570 --> 27:43.129
and told them Tuhon was here.

27:43.305 --> 27:44.966
The FBI then informed
the White House,

27:45.140 --> 27:48.075
who then informed the president
of Equatorial Guinea.

27:48.243 --> 27:50.905
And we've been ordered
to hand him over immediately.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.811
Yes. It's the FBI's case now.

27:54.783 --> 27:56.911
You're not gonna hand Tuhon over,
are you?

27:57.086 --> 27:59.316
Not even close, Mr. Beale.

28:00.656 --> 28:02.146
How is Santos doing?

28:02.324 --> 28:05.487
He's stable. His doctor is moving him
to a private facility.

28:11.867 --> 28:13.961
What the hell is this?

28:14.136 --> 28:15.604
You've heard of Obamacare?

28:15.771 --> 28:17.830
This is We Don't Care.

28:18.807 --> 28:21.742
Seriously, this is a palace
of post-op infection.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.038
I suggest you start talking.

28:24.980 --> 28:26.175
Cut me a deal.

28:26.348 --> 28:27.509
What are you offering?

28:27.683 --> 28:28.775
Steven Carter.

28:28.951 --> 28:30.316
And the fake tattoos?

28:30.486 --> 28:32.215
Saying Tuhon's name on camera?

28:32.388 --> 28:34.823
Leverage. If you went after Tuhon,

28:34.990 --> 28:37.391
he'd have no choice but to come out
of retirement for Carter

28:37.559 --> 28:39.357
and go back to being an outlaw.

28:40.596 --> 28:41.995
He's telling the truth.

28:43.232 --> 28:45.166
Yeah, but is that the whole truth?

28:59.014 --> 29:00.641
So we got a plan?

29:01.350 --> 29:02.977
Right now we wait.

29:03.152 --> 29:05.712
Hetty's contact is en route
with keys to a safe house.

29:05.888 --> 29:08.585
It's a favor from a Russian mobster
who owes her one.

29:09.458 --> 29:13.053
The FBI knows you're in town.
Figure Carter does too.

29:14.329 --> 29:16.093
We need to dump our phones
and go low vis.

29:17.666 --> 29:19.498
Hetty will meet us at the safe house.

29:19.668 --> 29:22.968
All comms go dark starting now.

29:24.239 --> 29:27.800
- How safe is the safe house?
- It's the only one we've got.

29:29.011 --> 29:30.843
Dump your phone, Tuhon.

29:31.747 --> 29:34.114
Starting to sound
like you're running things.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.878
It's gonna take
some getting used to.

29:37.586 --> 29:39.452
It's not what I remember.

29:39.621 --> 29:41.111
Oh, yeah?

29:41.824 --> 29:43.519
What do you remember?

29:44.927 --> 29:46.520
Fear.

29:47.062 --> 29:50.896
Two strangers who were afraid
to trust their training.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.267
Afraid to trust each other.

29:56.538 --> 29:58.199
What do you see now?

29:59.641 --> 30:01.575
Ask me in another seven years.

30:04.580 --> 30:07.743
We trust each other.
And I suggest you do the same,

30:07.916 --> 30:11.216
because right about now,
we're the only friends you got.

30:14.490 --> 30:16.390
A man with no friends

30:16.558 --> 30:19.755
doesn't have to worry
about them turning into enemies.

30:41.350 --> 30:44.411
- Why are we stopping?
- Because this is the place.

30:45.621 --> 30:46.645
What place?

30:47.189 --> 30:49.590
The place where we settle this.
Who are you working for?

30:50.659 --> 30:51.922
- I'm NCIS.
- Hmm.

30:52.094 --> 30:54.256
So you're telling me
Granger asked you to spy on me?

30:54.930 --> 30:57.194
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play me, Blye.

30:57.366 --> 30:59.266
I'm not. I...

31:00.169 --> 31:01.261
Okay. You know what?

31:01.436 --> 31:03.495
You have been in-country
way too long.

31:03.672 --> 31:05.712
It messes with your head.
You're losing perspective.

31:05.841 --> 31:07.601
So, what are you trying to do now,
handle me?

31:07.743 --> 31:09.677
- No, I'm just say...
- Shut up!

31:12.147 --> 31:14.548
What the hell are you trying to do, huh?
What are you up to?

31:14.983 --> 31:16.463
You're poking
around my bank accounts.

31:16.618 --> 31:18.552
You sent a drone to follow me.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.654
What, think you're the only one
with connections?

31:20.822 --> 31:22.790
- I thought we were on the same team.
- Sodid I.

31:22.958 --> 31:25.478
Wouldn't know it by the way
you've been sneaking behind my back.

31:25.627 --> 31:26.685
Why are you here?

31:26.862 --> 31:29.229
I told you,
I was brought in as a shooter.

31:29.398 --> 31:32.527
Oh, even you can't believe that.
There are guys more qualified than you.

31:33.302 --> 31:35.222
Why did you have Harris
taken off the assignment?

31:35.370 --> 31:37.236
- Didn't.
- What happened to Sanders?

31:37.973 --> 31:40.032
I already told you,
he got his head cut off.

31:40.209 --> 31:41.233
That part I know.

31:41.410 --> 31:44.505
What I don't know is where you were
while that was happening.

31:46.315 --> 31:47.908
Okay.

31:48.684 --> 31:49.708
This is crazy.

31:50.018 --> 31:52.248
Here. Go back to base camp.

31:53.088 --> 31:55.056
- What are you gonna do?
- My job.

31:55.224 --> 31:57.420
As CIA Officer Sabatino?

31:57.593 --> 31:58.719
Or as the White Ghost?

32:04.366 --> 32:05.731
You think I'm the Ghost?

32:06.868 --> 32:08.267
- Are you?
- Are you insane?

32:08.437 --> 32:11.600
- I've been hunting him for weeks.
- And yet nobody has seen him,

32:11.773 --> 32:14.674
and somehow Sanders gets his head
cut off while you two are together.

32:18.013 --> 32:19.606
What the hell are you doing?

32:20.249 --> 32:23.742
You leave now, you can make it back
to base camp before this thing dies.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.916
Don't try to follow me.

32:26.088 --> 32:27.681
I mean it.

32:28.624 --> 32:30.114
Sabatino.

32:31.727 --> 32:32.785
Sabatino!

32:49.244 --> 32:51.872
What if Hetty
doesn't show up at the safe house?

32:52.047 --> 32:53.708
She'll be there.

32:53.882 --> 32:55.850
You can count on that.

32:57.419 --> 32:59.888
What if she never shows up again?

33:00.055 --> 33:02.046
You know, one day, it could happen.

33:02.224 --> 33:04.283
Nobody lives forever.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.393
Hetty's not going anywhere.

33:09.231 --> 33:11.791
Who leads the tribe when she does?

33:14.536 --> 33:16.163
Is it gonna be you, Callen?

33:19.574 --> 33:20.632
How about you, Sam?

33:23.445 --> 33:26.346
Haven't planned on it, huh?
It scares you.

33:27.049 --> 33:29.780
I thought she trained you two
better than that.

33:31.486 --> 33:33.784
It's your fire.

33:34.690 --> 33:37.125
Enough with the mind games, hmm?

33:40.562 --> 33:42.553
You're in a dark room.

33:44.199 --> 33:46.190
Everyone you love is in there.

33:46.368 --> 33:48.700
All your family, all your friends.

33:49.638 --> 33:52.300
A flame comes out of nowhere.

33:52.607 --> 33:55.633
It's hot. Gets hotter.

33:58.013 --> 34:00.448
Your heart starts pumping.

34:00.849 --> 34:03.511
You can only take one person
by the hand and lead them out.

34:06.355 --> 34:08.346
Who do you choose?

34:09.791 --> 34:12.761
My house is burning down,
who do I save?

34:13.728 --> 34:15.561
My kid.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.495
I wasn't exactly thinking
about my house.

34:21.570 --> 34:25.734
Just a room
from this old orphanage.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.242
No special people.

34:30.379 --> 34:32.507
I'm walking out of there alone.

34:35.751 --> 34:37.719
What about you, Tuhon?

34:38.286 --> 34:40.186
Who do you save?

34:42.391 --> 34:45.554
My flame is on the end of a candle

34:45.893 --> 34:48.386
I just placed
on my son's birthday cake.

34:49.164 --> 34:54.568
Whole family. Watched him make
a wish and blow out the candle.

34:55.536 --> 34:57.699
Then I get him by the hand,

34:57.873 --> 35:01.400
lead him to the next room,
where all his presents are waiting.

35:02.244 --> 35:05.111
The flame was on the end of a candle
on your kid's birthday cake.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.408
You didn't say we could
answer the question like that.

35:07.582 --> 35:09.414
I didn't say you couldn't.

35:10.185 --> 35:11.380
It's your fire.

35:12.287 --> 35:14.381
It can be whatever you want it to be.

35:15.056 --> 35:17.024
Look, Carter covered all of his bases.

35:17.192 --> 35:19.183
Okay?
He paid off Tuhon's crew in Mexico,

35:19.361 --> 35:22.122
and he planned on ratting them out
to the FBI if he made it back here,

35:22.264 --> 35:25.461
which means you can't hide him
in federally sanctioned safe houses.

35:25.634 --> 35:27.102
You know what he did next?

35:27.269 --> 35:29.704
He paid off every organized
crime group in Los Angeles

35:29.871 --> 35:31.737
so that if Tuhon goes there
for safe haven,

35:31.907 --> 35:33.705
who's he gonna find waiting for him?
Carter.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.343
Deeks.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.309
Hetty got a safe house
from the Russians.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.539
We gotta warn Callen and Sam
before they get there.

35:41.516 --> 35:43.156
We can't get in touch
with Callen and Sam.

35:43.285 --> 35:45.754
They dumped their phones,
and Hetty just left to go meet them.

35:45.921 --> 35:48.219
- Now she's gone dark too.
- Deeks and Nate?

35:48.390 --> 35:49.880
They're headed
for the safe house now.

35:50.058 --> 35:51.423
They'll never get there in time.

36:00.735 --> 36:01.759
Hetty.

36:04.239 --> 36:06.139
She's here.

36:10.378 --> 36:11.675
Lord Jim?

36:12.380 --> 36:14.542
You don't strike me
as a Conrad guy.

36:14.716 --> 36:17.481
- I only read first editions.
- Uh-huh.

36:17.886 --> 36:20.014
Man of letters.

36:20.188 --> 36:21.678
I can respect that.

36:22.190 --> 36:25.421
Letters have killed more men
than any blade of mine.

36:27.462 --> 36:29.624
Blades are a woman's tool.

36:29.931 --> 36:32.093
Sneaky and underhanded.

36:32.567 --> 36:35.093
Glad I got to say that to your face,
Tuhon.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.034
Seem like the kind of guys

36:37.205 --> 36:39.799
that will fall
for the hundred-dollar-bill trick?

36:40.242 --> 36:41.801
Nope.

36:53.854 --> 36:56.653
I've got five hostiles in that house
with Callen, Sam and Tuhon.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.791
Deeks and Nate
are still ten minutes out.

36:58.959 --> 37:00.552
Come on, Hetty.

37:00.727 --> 37:01.956
Kill these guys.

37:02.629 --> 37:04.393
Bury them out back.

37:04.731 --> 37:07.098
I'll handle Tuhon.

37:09.202 --> 37:11.694
Room feeling a little crowded to you?

37:11.872 --> 37:14.307
I was just about to say
the same thing.

37:17.911 --> 37:20.312
- It's locked.
- This one's secured as well.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.881
These are all new locks, Carter.
High-end.

37:23.050 --> 37:24.142
Custom stuff.

37:24.318 --> 37:26.912
Military grade, actually.

37:27.087 --> 37:28.714
Try blowing a hole in the wall.

37:28.889 --> 37:30.323
It'll be easier.

37:31.191 --> 37:33.888
- What is this?
- Looks like a trap to me.

37:34.494 --> 37:36.986
You were dead
before you even walked in the room.

37:39.433 --> 37:40.901
Let us go and I won't kill you.

37:45.072 --> 37:48.838
Now, those are bold words
from an old man armed with a book.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.970
Oh, this book?

38:04.992 --> 38:07.586
- He was already dead.
- Yeah.

38:07.928 --> 38:10.761
We were just waiting for him
to show us how he wanted to go.

38:29.850 --> 38:34.947
In my tribe,
we salute warriors with the mano po.

38:35.389 --> 38:38.950
It's respect for the knowledge
passed down to us

38:39.126 --> 38:44.394
through men and women
who paid the price in blood.

38:50.637 --> 38:52.401
Hello, Tuhon.

38:52.806 --> 38:54.570
It was a perfect plan, Hetty.

38:54.741 --> 38:57.301
Oh, you can thank Callen and Sam
for that.

38:57.477 --> 39:00.344
The perfect plan was theirs.

39:01.915 --> 39:04.714
Looks like you two grew a little faster
than I thought.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.751
Yeah, we're still growing.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.718
Always will be.

39:09.322 --> 39:12.053
You'll always be the master to us,
Tuhon.

39:12.692 --> 39:16.560
Today you were more Tuhon
than me.

39:22.936 --> 39:24.335
Cavalry's here.

39:24.504 --> 39:27.565
Did you get bagpipes with that suit?

39:30.544 --> 39:33.946
So you leaked the address to Carter?
Lure him out?

39:34.114 --> 39:35.343
Nice knife, kid.

39:36.917 --> 39:37.941
Oh, yeah?

39:39.486 --> 39:41.045
You like it?

39:41.922 --> 39:43.253
I made it.

39:44.091 --> 39:46.025
Long time ago for a friend.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.291
You made it?

39:49.729 --> 39:51.288
It's not, um...

39:51.465 --> 39:53.490
It's not mine. I just, uh...

39:53.867 --> 39:56.063
I'm just taking care of it
for somebody.

39:56.736 --> 39:59.034
Maybe it's taking care of you.

39:59.739 --> 40:01.730
Friend had a daughter.

40:02.175 --> 40:04.041
I don't remember her name.

40:04.211 --> 40:06.077
Sweetest little girl I ever met.

40:16.957 --> 40:19.187
- Where have you been?
- Out with Sabatino.

40:19.359 --> 40:21.327
- Where is he?
- He took off on his own

40:21.495 --> 40:23.896
after he disabled our car
and warned me not to follow him.

40:24.064 --> 40:25.293
Yeah, that's right.

40:25.465 --> 40:26.955
Your boy's off the reservation.

40:29.202 --> 40:31.637
He has his own way of doing things.

40:35.342 --> 40:37.777
Did you ever consider
that maybe he's the one we're after?

40:40.580 --> 40:42.309
- That's ridiculous.
- Ls it?

40:42.482 --> 40:45.076
Sanders was killed mysteriously
under his watch.

40:45.252 --> 40:47.050
We never know where he is
or what he's up to,

40:47.220 --> 40:49.780
and I caught him meeting with
three armed locals on a drone feed,

40:49.923 --> 40:51.015
which he basically denied.

40:52.726 --> 40:54.023
You're getting paranoid, Blye.

40:54.194 --> 40:55.218
Listen to me,

40:55.395 --> 40:58.194
I back Sabatino 100 percent
as much as I do you.

40:58.365 --> 40:59.855
Maybe you've been in-country
too long.

41:00.033 --> 41:02.365
Yeah, maybe.

41:03.203 --> 41:05.331
- But what if I'm right?
- You aren't.

41:05.505 --> 41:06.905
What if Sabatino
is the White Ghost?

41:07.040 --> 41:09.702
- He isn't.
- But what if he is?

41:10.610 --> 41:13.102
You are here with one mission
and one mission only:

41:13.280 --> 41:15.612
To take out the Ghost, whoever he is.

41:24.824 --> 41:27.122
Ahh. All right.

41:27.294 --> 41:28.887
Who's down for a beer?

41:29.062 --> 41:30.359
Well, you can count me in.

41:30.730 --> 41:32.323
Next time.

41:32.499 --> 41:34.024
Where do you deploy next, Nate?

41:34.201 --> 41:36.898
Well, I could tell you, Sam,
but then I'd have to...

41:37.771 --> 41:39.136
It's classified.

41:39.306 --> 41:40.330
He's learning.

41:41.708 --> 41:42.869
Ah. Heh.

41:43.043 --> 41:44.738
Interesting. It's Joelle.

41:44.911 --> 41:46.401
She's revising her score.

41:48.148 --> 41:50.310
You can't do that.
Score is a score. It's permanent.

41:50.483 --> 41:51.507
Until it's not.

41:51.685 --> 41:53.585
- She revised it.
- Oh.

41:54.588 --> 41:56.386
Okay, Teddy.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.388
- What's my new score?
- Wait, what?

41:58.558 --> 42:00.993
Did you just call him...?
Are you Teddy?

42:01.161 --> 42:03.459
Unless you're a former
Miss Universe contestant,

42:03.630 --> 42:06.429
- keep Teddy out your mouth.
- Ha-ha-ha.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.500
Well, I think Teddy
is very sophisticated.

42:08.668 --> 42:11.028
- Goes with houndstooth.
- You can't have fun not saying it.

42:11.171 --> 42:14.436
You know, like, "Hey! Teddy! Teddy!"

42:14.808 --> 42:16.037
Gentlemen.

42:17.177 --> 42:20.841
I cannot remember the last time
you left here before us.

42:21.014 --> 42:24.348
I cannot remember the last time
I had a friend in town.

42:24.517 --> 42:26.849
Hmm. Where does Tuhon go now?

42:27.020 --> 42:28.454
He won't tell me.

42:28.622 --> 42:30.249
And I won't ask.

42:30.724 --> 42:32.192
Yeah.

42:32.626 --> 42:34.287
Tribe's in good hands.

42:34.461 --> 42:35.587
Is it?

42:36.363 --> 42:38.024
No matter what.

42:38.498 --> 42:40.023
That's a promise.

42:40.533 --> 42:42.797
Well, let's not get carried away.

42:42.969 --> 42:46.030
I'll be back
before you can burn this place down.

42:51.044 --> 42:52.876
Yeah, Tuhon's right.

42:53.380 --> 42:54.745
It's our fire.

42:54.914 --> 42:56.746
Yeah,
but on the end of a birthday candle?

42:56.916 --> 42:59.146
Come on. That's cheating.

42:59.419 --> 43:03.117
I mean, what if I said
it was me setting his ponytail on fire?

43:03.657 --> 43:05.352
It can be anything we want it to be.

43:05.525 --> 43:07.493
Ha, ha. Yeah, okay.
