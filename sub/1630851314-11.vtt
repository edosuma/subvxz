Hello, my son. There is a chance
that someone will come for you.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.052
He will be looking
for my equation,

00:09.096 --> 00:10.923
which is being embedded into
your consciousness as we speak.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.925
The equation is
the framework

00:12.969 --> 00:15.145
for the chemical weapon
that will decouple the dictator

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
from all his vessels
permanently.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
I got a bit more
from my father

00:19.236 --> 00:21.151
in terms of a way
to stop the dictator.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.674
He told me that
if we can't separate

00:22.718 --> 00:24.546
the clone from his destiny,

00:24.589 --> 00:27.549
the responsibility
falls to me to kill him.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.159
LIZ:
Whoever gets the science first

00:29.203 --> 00:31.074
controls whose body
Max stays in.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.858
If he solves this equation
before Michael

00:32.902 --> 00:34.773
is able to get it out
of the machine,

00:34.817 --> 00:36.906
then Jones'll be able to stay
in your body permanently.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.690
It makes sense he'd
go after your lab partner

00:38.734 --> 00:40.388
and try to make a deal--
the next best thing to you,

00:40.431 --> 00:41.432
especially
with all your research.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.130
You need Max's body.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.784
You want to be more than
just a guest inside of it!

00:45.828 --> 00:47.569
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.223
I'm as smart
as you are confident.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.355
There aren't a lot

Your best chance of survival

03:16.196 --> 03:18.110
Reading her notes,

03:18.154 --> 03:20.678
frequency will untether you,
but for the procedure to stick,

03:20.722 --> 03:23.290
we need to permanently block
the bond between you and Max.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.467
Essentially, your DNA is built
to want to stay connected.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.817
But Liz had a theory about
those spores being used

03:28.860 --> 03:30.862
to regenerate lost
brain tissue in Maria.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.821
Now, I'm betting
that the same approach

03:32.864 --> 03:36.172
can be augmented to trick the
body into bonding with itself,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.174

03:38.218 --> 03:40.263

I am concerned

04:58.820 --> 05:00.430
that she's bled out.She hasn't.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.606
In fact, I've given her
some of the same meal

05:02.650 --> 05:04.608

that I think you would enjoy.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.088

badly, why don't you just

05:06.131 --> 05:07.698

whatever science
it is you need

05:12.355 --> 05:15.227

try to force me to do?The truth is

05:20.711 --> 05:22.800

05:22.844 --> 05:25.063
It is that creativity

05:25.107 --> 05:27.152
I've come to believe
that, together,

05:27.196 --> 05:30.330
we could use to save
not one world...

about the whole Max thing,

05:33.811 --> 05:35.465
and if you
would just hear me out,

05:35.509 --> 05:38.729
I think you'd realize
that we can save him, too.

05:38.773 --> 05:41.906
We can end
all this fighting today.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.779

Heath covertly built
this CB transmitter

06:38.963 --> 06:41.357
during some science project
Jones is forcing him to do.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.968
He used it to send a coded
message to this camp counselor

06:44.012 --> 06:46.188
we used to have
at Mesa Pines.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.146
He's deep in the ham/CB scene.
Don't ask.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.800
So the camp counselor
called me,

06:49.844 --> 06:51.715
and I cracked the message,
and it said this:

06:51.759 --> 06:54.109
Liz, the sheriff and Heath--
they're all being held captive

06:54.152 --> 06:55.893
at some mansion
on Eagle Ridge Drive.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.462
ISOBEL: Wait a second,
I know this house.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.769
I, uh, hosted a charity
fundraiser here a few years ago.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.771
The main entrance is here,

07:03.814 --> 07:06.817
and there are side entrances
here and here.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.819
Great. So if we approach
the house from this side,

07:08.863 --> 07:11.474
then we'll have a little bit of
cover, and we got a good angle

07:11.518 --> 07:13.824
on both those doors.You're not planning on going
into the house, are you?

07:13.868 --> 07:15.260
I'm a cop.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.001
With a dictator
doppelgaänger.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.829
You heard the rest of the
newbie alien's message.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.352
Heath is planning on tweaking
the genetics on the sly

07:20.396 --> 07:21.919
and swapping you

07:21.963 --> 07:23.530
and evil you back.She always this direct?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.532
ALL: Yes.Look, just because

07:25.575 --> 07:26.837
I'm not sugarcoating it
doesn't make me wrong.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.491
Which means,
if you come with us...

07:28.535 --> 07:30.624
You could wind up
my nightmare dad at any moment.

07:30.667 --> 07:31.886
Great.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.670
I will hang out
on the bench.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.890
You can sulk in
the honeycomb cage.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.326
Look, if Liz's
ex-lab partner

07:37.369 --> 07:39.154
is successful,
then we get you back

07:39.197 --> 07:41.112
and Jones locked away
all in one swoop.So while I

07:41.156 --> 07:42.374
twiddle my thumbs in a cage,

07:42.418 --> 07:43.419
y'all still have
to figure out

07:43.463 --> 07:44.725
how to outsmart Jones.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.204
You know, Michael,
I've been thinking.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.858
Maybe, as his son,

07:47.902 --> 07:51.688
you have an ability that
could help even the odds.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.473
What are you getting at, Iz?

07:53.516 --> 07:55.083
Maybe you jump
into the sheriff's head

07:55.126 --> 07:56.650
and get her to free them all.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.174
Besides registering a ten
on the creepy scale,

07:59.217 --> 08:01.219
no, I can't do that.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.527
I got his brown eyes,
but body snatching is recessive.Okay,

08:04.571 --> 08:05.659
what about
your mom's sword?

08:05.702 --> 08:07.356
Did you find it?Not exactly,

08:07.399 --> 08:08.966
but I did go on an
exploratory drive the other day,

08:09.010 --> 08:10.664
and I picked up a frequency,

08:10.707 --> 08:12.753
and it was a lot like yours
near the Long Farm.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.712
With that sword, your mom
was able to stand her ground

08:15.756 --> 08:17.975
against Jones. we need to get
our hands on that weapon.MICHAEL: Agreed.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.455
And I been thinking, since we
can't bring the cage with us...

08:19.499 --> 08:20.935
Right, 'cause
I'll be sitting in it.

08:20.978 --> 08:23.067
...I could fashion
a pair of handcuffs.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.853
They could be used
to disable Jones' abilities.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.245
That's good.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.725
I guess that leaves me

08:28.769 --> 08:29.944
to go secure Max.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.859
And then I'll hightail
back here

08:31.902 --> 08:34.078
and keep transcribing
the, uh, equation

08:34.122 --> 08:36.559
Daddy dropped in my head.Considering it's
the only thing

08:36.603 --> 08:39.257
keeping, uh,
Max and Diet Max tethered.

08:39.301 --> 08:43.131
Yeah. We got to keep you as
far away from Jones as possible.

08:44.698 --> 08:48.049
I've had a lot of time
to think about my path.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.485
My missteps.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.575
And I've come to realize
that this body

08:52.619 --> 08:54.403
must be my last.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.665
You mean Max's.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.493
Stay with me here.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.713
I believe we
can significantly advance

08:59.756 --> 09:03.020
your existing research into
the manipulation of telomeres.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.675
That is the part
of Max's DNA

09:05.719 --> 09:08.025
that I believe Nora targeted
in order to graft

09:08.069 --> 09:10.419
his life force onto mine.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.422
My work is still theoretical.I have

09:13.465 --> 09:16.860
scientific knowledge
of an advanced alien society

09:16.904 --> 09:18.862
that you could
never even dream of.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.212
And once our collaboration
is complete,

09:21.256 --> 09:23.824
I will leave this planet,
peacefully.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.391
You can use that research
to save Max,

09:26.435 --> 09:28.219
and, at the end of the day,

09:28.263 --> 09:31.745
do something good
for this world.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.225
Or you could give
Max his body back

09:34.269 --> 09:38.012
and, as a bonus, I will amend
your body's genetics.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.971
This skin suit is
the best leverage I have.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.625
And I believe

09:42.669 --> 09:45.236
advancing your science
by at least a century

09:45.280 --> 09:46.629
is a fair trade.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.936
I have no reason to trust you.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.329
The truth isn't always pretty.

09:51.373 --> 09:55.290
But at the end of the day,
it is the truth.

09:57.248 --> 10:00.208
See, I think you and I are more
alike than you want to believe.

10:00.251 --> 10:03.646
You're also an up-and-coming
Latino scientist from Roswell?

10:03.690 --> 10:06.170

By the time I was born,

10:06.214 --> 10:08.564
my planet's future was bleak.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.826
It was dying.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.872
It needed healing.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.181
So I decided to do

10:17.225 --> 10:20.315
what no one else
had the strength to do.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.973
I made the tough choice
that people like us

10:26.016 --> 10:27.757
are strong enough to make.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.761
I became its savior.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.944
How does one...

10:40.988 --> 10:43.991
go about saving
a whole planet, exactly?

10:44.034 --> 10:45.688
Well, as I'm sure
you've realized,

10:45.732 --> 10:48.169
being extraordinary
comes at a cost.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.605
[short chuckle]

10:49.649 --> 10:52.042
It is our burden
to make the hard choices,

10:52.086 --> 10:54.697
the ones that save
the most lives while causing

10:54.741 --> 10:56.525
the least suffering.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.659
Making these decisions
requires something rare.

10:59.702 --> 11:02.226
It requires... vision

11:02.270 --> 11:04.272
and the knowledge that...

11:04.315 --> 11:08.319
suffering can never
be avoided completely.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.366
What did you do?

11:11.409 --> 11:13.760
I realized...

11:13.803 --> 11:17.111
that there was
no fixing our world.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.852
If we wanted

11:18.895 --> 11:21.028
to have a future...

11:21.071 --> 11:23.117
we had to start anew.

11:24.945 --> 11:28.557
[panicked shouting, screaming]

11:35.129 --> 11:36.739
MAX:
I'd say Jones is a psychopath,

11:36.783 --> 11:38.741
but that would be a
huge understatement.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.309
Do you have any idea
what he's really capable of?I do.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.398
A crazy alien machine just
dumped my dead dad's memories

11:43.441 --> 11:45.226
in my head, okay?

11:45.269 --> 11:47.707
I'm not saying the guy was
handing out free ice cream.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.101
What I am saying: we got to
give Heath's plan a chance.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.715
Do you seriously trust Heath
to take on the monster

11:55.758 --> 11:58.239
that's always
three steps ahead of us?

11:58.282 --> 12:00.415
You know, sometimes hope
blossoms out of darkness.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.330
How can you be so calm
right now?

12:02.373 --> 12:03.461
Didn't your dad just give you
a highlight reel

12:03.505 --> 12:05.159
of the hell that Jones caused...

12:05.202 --> 12:06.856
I'm not gonna lie, Dep,
the whole thing spun me

12:06.900 --> 12:08.423
like one of my 45 vinyls.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.642
Every time around,
I got more questions.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.210
Who am I? You know,
what do I believe now?

12:13.254 --> 12:14.908
I've been praying for guidance.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.041
So you revert to faith.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.869
I'll stick to facts.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.219
Okay, you may have gotten
a glimpse of what Jones is,

12:22.263 --> 12:23.699
but I am living it.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.875
He's wearing my face,
wearing my uniform,

12:25.919 --> 12:28.095
luring people in
to hurt them.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.966
And now, if I'm
the other side of this coin,

12:30.010 --> 12:32.229
doesn't that implicitly make me
my brother's keeper?

12:32.273 --> 12:33.622
What are you getting at?

12:33.665 --> 12:34.797
The science that
your dad helped create.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.146
It says that

12:36.190 --> 12:38.758
if I die,
Jones dies, too, right?

12:38.801 --> 12:40.150
Yeah.I don't want to,

12:40.194 --> 12:41.978
but it's got
to be a sin

12:42.022 --> 12:45.286
to not act when I know
I could save millions of lives,

12:45.329 --> 12:48.028
or, at the very least, make sure
the people I love are safe.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.943
[sighs]
Uh...

12:50.944 --> 12:52.902
Yeah.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.035
Yeah, you know, honestly,
my dad thought that

12:55.078 --> 12:57.559
that might be
the only option.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.822
That's why he tasked me
with a difficult choice.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.867
And what's that?

13:02.085 --> 13:03.957
I wasn't talking to God
about my faith.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.436
I was praying
on how my dad

13:05.480 --> 13:07.917
entrusted me to kill you,
if need be,

13:07.961 --> 13:09.876
to save two worlds.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.923
Anything?

13:13.967 --> 13:17.753
It's faint, and it's not exactly
the same as your sound, but...

13:17.797 --> 13:19.929
there's something coming
from over there.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.805
Hey, are you sure
you're comfortable with this?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.807
I know the Hat-Longs
aren't exactly friends

13:27.850 --> 13:30.244
with the Ortech-coys.No, I'm fine.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.638
Rosa?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.423
What are you keeping from me?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.512
Nothing. I'm just trying not
to step on any cow pies.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.948
Did you know that I have

13:38.992 --> 13:40.863
this new ability
where I can...

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
sense someone's emotions?

13:42.909 --> 13:46.173
Stop. Okay, you did not tell me
that you got mood ring powers.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.652
Well, I've been a little busy
with an alien overlord.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.393
Mm-hmm.But seriously,

13:49.437 --> 13:51.831
what's with the conflicting
vibes, Rosalinda?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.658
Rosalinda
might have accidentally

13:53.702 --> 13:55.225
buetiricalled Wyatt Long
and made him

13:55.269 --> 13:56.748
forget his racism, along with

13:56.792 --> 13:59.055
all the rest of who
he knew himself to be.

13:59.099 --> 14:02.102
What?! You didn't tell me
that you melted Long's brain?

14:02.145 --> 14:03.364
I was busy

14:03.407 --> 14:05.627
with the same alien overlord.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.672
That's a fair point. But still.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.152
Look, Wyatt and I

14:09.196 --> 14:11.633
have kind of been hanging out,
like...

14:11.676 --> 14:13.504
a lot.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.898
Please tell me you're not going
all West Side Story

14:15.942 --> 14:18.205
with this kid.No!

14:18.248 --> 14:20.294
Look, my point is that...

14:20.337 --> 14:22.122
at first I was
curious to see

14:22.165 --> 14:24.559
if it would all come
rushing back, right?Mm-hmm.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.865
And then...

14:25.908 --> 14:29.651
I was curious if
he could change.

14:29.694 --> 14:30.652
Like, really change.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.567
And I thought

14:32.610 --> 14:33.916
if he could,
then I could, too.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.396
He did it, Isobel.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.745
He grew.
He found a way

14:36.788 --> 14:38.616
to leave Roswell.WYATT: Boo!

14:38.660 --> 14:41.402
Oh, my God.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.491
We have got to stop
meeting like this.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.190
You're awfully quiet.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.845
You lit a planet on fire.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.066
What about that makes me
want to partner up with you?

14:53.109 --> 14:54.937
You really are brilliant.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.244
So brilliant, in fact,Mm.

14:57.287 --> 15:01.117
that I often forget
how little you actually know

15:01.161 --> 15:03.206
about our abilities.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.604
See, they're not just skills.

15:09.647 --> 15:12.650
They're who we are.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.479
Fire is a part of my destiny.

15:15.523 --> 15:20.006
See, it doesn't just
destroy for no reason.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.095
Fire destroys to create.

15:28.405 --> 15:33.062
From the fall of oppressors
and the ignorant came hope.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.328
How did that help you?

15:38.372 --> 15:39.982
The yellow pollen
from that flower--

15:40.026 --> 15:42.419
it inhibits your abilities.True.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.291
But the purple petals
from that flower contain

15:44.334 --> 15:46.032
the equivalent of stem cells,

15:46.075 --> 15:49.078
which can be used to cultivate
all number of resources.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.997
You are judging the choices

15:55.041 --> 15:56.607
that I've made,

15:56.651 --> 15:59.567
but a part of you understands
why I made them.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.961
You want me to do a bad thing
to do a good thing.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.745
You want me to work with you
to save Max.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.747
There's a line
in every person's heart

16:05.790 --> 16:07.967
that tells them
how far they're willing to go

16:08.010 --> 16:09.969
for what they believe in.

16:10.012 --> 16:13.494
I am simply reminding you
where yours is.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.845
So, you're sitting on a rock

16:16.888 --> 16:18.890
asking God
if you should kill me?

16:18.934 --> 16:20.588
I was sitting on a rock

16:20.631 --> 16:22.068
and things got big...

16:22.111 --> 16:23.678
and complicated.

16:23.721 --> 16:26.420
I thought about morality,
then faith, and...

16:26.463 --> 16:30.250
You know, am I a vessel for the
actions of the Almighty Father,

16:30.293 --> 16:32.034
or my alien one?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.341
Then I got a call from
this old counselor

16:34.384 --> 16:36.125
that I used to have
at Mesa Pines,

16:36.169 --> 16:38.084
and he reminded
me of a lesson

16:38.127 --> 16:40.303
that I learned
a long time ago.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.612
They taught us
that these knives

16:44.655 --> 16:47.571
Represent that there's
always another path.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.487
You just got to find
the right one.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.011
[closes pocketknife]

16:52.054 --> 16:53.925
Your dad entrusted you
with an action.

16:53.969 --> 16:58.582
I'm giving you permission
to take that action.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.677
The thing is, though...

17:09.115 --> 17:11.073
...I don't think I'm here
to kill you.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.076
I think I'm here

17:14.120 --> 17:16.992
'cause God wants me
to keep you alive.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.262
Um, I didn't realize

17:26.306 --> 17:28.264
you were back in town.Yeah, I was working

17:28.308 --> 17:30.571
with one those nonprofit outfits
building low-income housing.

17:30.614 --> 17:33.487
Trying not to be
a dickhead, for once.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.445
But my dad's retiring,
and he wanted me back

17:35.489 --> 17:36.446
for this whole thing,

17:36.490 --> 17:38.274
and...[gunshot]

17:38.318 --> 17:40.755
Wait, what are you guys
doing here?It's a bit

17:40.798 --> 17:42.061
of Evans family intrigue,
really.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.758
It's sort of
a forbidden love story.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.281
No.Yeah, upstairs,
downstairs,

17:45.325 --> 17:47.501
a West Side StoryWell, no, not really.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.068
kind of vibe.
There's a artifact

17:49.111 --> 17:50.678
buried somewhere on this farm.

17:50.721 --> 17:51.809
Yes, that's true.Oh. Oh.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.681
Yeah. That makes no sense.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.770
But I'm picking up
a "you don't want me to know

17:55.813 --> 17:56.901
so I shouldn't even ask"
sort of vibe.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.555
Look, I owe you,

17:58.599 --> 18:00.035
Rosalinda, so-so if you
need help, I'll help.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.863
If you could get

18:01.906 --> 18:04.909
your family to clear out,
you would be making a huge dent

18:04.953 --> 18:06.911
in your karmic debt--
to me, at least.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.305
Well, that's easy-- I'll
just tell them I saw a coyote.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.741
One of them got
in the chickens last week,

18:10.785 --> 18:12.308
and between all of them,
they got

18:12.352 --> 18:15.094
about seven shotguns
and one hell of a grudge.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.446
According to a
flood of memories

18:19.489 --> 18:22.971
that I got
from the Spielberg prop,

18:23.014 --> 18:26.235
Jones figured out that he had
cracked the code on cloning.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.194
You know, my dad thought
that he could repopulate

18:28.237 --> 18:33.112
their world from the animals
and plants that were dying off.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.201
But Jones came to him,

18:35.244 --> 18:37.681
asked him
if he could make clones of him.

18:37.725 --> 18:38.682
But my dad said no.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.162
Next thing he knew,

18:40.206 --> 18:42.556
Jones showed up
when my mom got sick.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.906
Said, "I'll offer to heal her if
you fire up your cloning tech."

18:44.949 --> 18:46.516
But still,

18:46.560 --> 18:49.519
my dad said no,
refused to cross that line.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.653
Next memory that I have,
it's of a five-year-old boy.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.612
With a blade under his neck.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.357
Jones used me as leverage
against my dad

19:01.401 --> 19:03.403
to force his hand.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.232
And that's how
the clones got made.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.712
It took years for my
dad, Nora and Louise

19:08.756 --> 19:10.671
to plan a rebellion.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.152
They stole Jones' DNA
and they made you.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.110
You know,
once you got old enough,

19:15.154 --> 19:16.938
you became their Trojan horse.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.853
They were
able to alter

19:18.896 --> 19:21.986
your genetic code
so that it couldn't be cloned.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.380
And because they built you to
be tethered to the dictator,

19:24.424 --> 19:26.077
Jones had his DNA altered
in the process.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.905
But didn't he have

19:27.949 --> 19:30.734
a whole cache of clones
to draw from?He did,

19:30.778 --> 19:33.259
until Nora destroyed
his entire clone supply.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.913
Making me both his undoing...

19:35.957 --> 19:38.568
and the only way
to keep him alive.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.442
You're right,
everyone has a line.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.445
You're asking me
to cross mine, so...

19:45.488 --> 19:48.404
I'd like to see you
at least approach one, too.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.233
And what are you getting at,
Elizabeth?

19:51.277 --> 19:55.672
If you're not gonna negotiate
swapping back into your body...

19:55.716 --> 19:58.327
what about you and the sheriff?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.636
Fix her gunshot wound
and let her go.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.510
Now we're getting somewhere.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.208
If you're
a little piece in this,

20:09.251 --> 20:11.253
then I'm front and center
in this.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.038
I mean, by your dad's own
admission, I was built to die.No.

make into stem cells.

will block off the connection

reverse-engineered Max's DNA

could be cloned again.
