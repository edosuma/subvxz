19:32.838 --> 19:34.506
- Egh, I hate Mole People.
- Oh my god, they're the worst.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.141
- Wait, Mole People
are real?!

19:36.208 --> 19:38.143
- Yes, and they are
impossible to get rid of.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.846
Uhhhh, oh--

19:40.913 --> 19:43.582
I saw this spider right,

19:43.649 --> 19:45.350
I went to get a tissue,
and turned around,

19:45.417 --> 19:46.852
couldn't find it
for the life of me,

19:46.919 --> 19:49.221
so, obviously...

19:49.288 --> 19:51.056

fifth one got blown up
over a churro--

19:55.027 --> 19:57.496

19:57.563 --> 20:00.899
- Woahhhh woah woah...

20:00.966 --> 20:03.535

right below this one?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.404
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.372
I wouldn't risk
blowing up our only Man Cave

20:07.439 --> 20:10.576
over a churro.
That would be crazy.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.946

- This is amazing.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.876

20:47.946 --> 20:50.048
- Okay.
First things first.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.617
Let's put the self-destruct
button away

20:51.683 --> 20:53.285
before someone accidentally
hits it again.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.954
- Grrr!

20:56.021 --> 20:58.323
