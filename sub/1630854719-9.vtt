WEBVTT

00:31.072 --> 00:32.115
Fuck!

01:04.647 --> 01:05.732
It's me!

01:08.943 --> 01:10.278
Anyone?

03:06.561 --> 03:07.478
Oh shit.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.085
Hi.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.338
Hey.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.856
Yeah, you tell 'em.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.026
You fuckin' tell 'em, Ellie.

04:02.951 --> 04:03.868
Okay.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.165
Hi.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.293
You're so tough.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.339
I got you. It's okay.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.259
Yeah, it's okay.

06:47.031 --> 06:47.949
Anna?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.028
Oh God.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.449
It's not your fault.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.034
We were delayed getting out of the zone.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.036
She's hungry.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.124
She needs to be fed, and I

07:39.876 --> 07:41.419
I didn't wanna nurse her.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.803
I cut it before I was bit.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.183
Before.

07:57.351 --> 08:02.148
I want you to take her with you to Boston

08:02.148 --> 08:05.401
find someone to bring her up
and make sure that she's safe.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.069
I can't do that.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.613
And I want you to give her this.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.200
Anna.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.204
Her name is Ellie.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.416
I can't.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.835
How long have we known each other?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.219
Our whole lives.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.849
So you pick her up right now

08:37.600 --> 08:39.519
and then you kill me.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.925
I can't kill you.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.387
Please, please, please.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.888
Please!

09:20.559 --> 09:21.894
Marlene!

09:26.023 --> 09:26.941
Here.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.069
Hold her head. There you go.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.030
Take this.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.917
Cover her ears.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.716
Ellie.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.802
Ellie.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.681
Ellie!

10:42.558 --> 10:43.893
D'ya hear me?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.103
No. What?

10:46.604 --> 10:48.356
Well, I found this in there.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.358
Beefaroni. Chef Boyardee.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.568
Oh, cool.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.866
And have you ever played this?

10:58.866 --> 11:00.868
Boggle? It's a word game.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.791
Well, if you wanna beat me at somethin',
it would be this.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.296
Well, all right then.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.298
We're gettin' close.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.759
Hospital that way.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.552
May be the one we're lookin' for.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.179
Got it.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.739
Take this for me?

11:43.202 --> 11:44.328
Thanks.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.380
They had a guitar in that RV.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.384
It was all smashed up but got me thinkin'

11:58.384 --> 11:59.760
maybe I should find one.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.054
I haven't played in forever.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.932
In fact, I was thinkin'
maybe I could teach you.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.767
I bet you'd be great at it.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.855
Do you wanna learn how to play guitar?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.110
Ellie?

12:17.319 --> 12:18.446
Oh, yeah.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.117
That'd be great.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.812
Okay, so this is what I'm thinking--

12:51.812 --> 12:53.689
Cut through that building
to get around that stuff,

12:53.689 --> 12:56.317
find the skyscraper,
go up and look around.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.905
Actually, this time
I was thinkin' we blast

13:00.905 --> 13:02.072
our way through that rubble.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.533
I found some dynamite
in that RV back there.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.868
Really?

13:06.785 --> 13:08.579
No, so we're gonna cut through
that building,

13:08.579 --> 13:11.207
find a skyscraper, go up and look around.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.959
But I had you goin', didn't I?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.312
Look at this place.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.065
Talk about bad luck.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.859
Military drops bombs,

13:38.859 --> 13:42.863
not one of them hits the building
you're trying to demolish.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.494
No way up.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.225
I get you up there,
you can drop that ladder down,

14:11.225 --> 14:13.227
maybe we go through that way.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.938
Come on. I'll give you a boost.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.914
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.709
It's just you kinda seem
extra quiet today, so.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.212
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.507
- Did you hear what I--
- Yeah, boost.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.717
Got it.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.522
One, two, up.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.779
- Ya got it?
- Yeah.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.156
Okay.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.084
Whoa!

15:20.836 --> 15:22.379
God damn it, Ellie!

15:22.963 --> 15:23.881
Shit.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.550
You stay there!

15:27.676 --> 15:29.386
You gotta see this!

15:29.386 --> 15:30.554
Ellie?

15:31.138 --> 15:32.264
Up here!

15:33.140 --> 15:34.683
- Ellie!
- C'mon!

15:41.815 --> 15:43.609
- Ellie.
- C'mon!

15:43.609 --> 15:46.320
Just wait. God damn it.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.474
- Don't scare it.
- I won't.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.606
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.776
Come here, hurry up. Come on.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.086
Hey there.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.520
So fucking cool.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.442
Where's she going?

17:07.067 --> 17:08.986
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

17:12.573 --> 17:13.699
Okay.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.277
So

17:51.111 --> 17:53.238
is it everything ya hoped for?

17:54.406 --> 17:56.700
It's got its ups and downs,

17:56.700 --> 17:58.911
but you can't deny that view.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.380
Look, I don't know exactly
where this hospital is--

18:10.380 --> 18:12.007
Yeah, we'll find it.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.593
Sure. It's just--

18:17.930 --> 18:19.681
Maybe there's nothin'
bad out there, but so far

18:19.681 --> 18:21.725
there's always been
somethin' bad out there.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.813
- We're still here, though.
- I know.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.148
I'm only saying there's risk.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.319
We don't have to do this.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.613
I want you to know that.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.490
What do you mean?
What else are we supposed to do?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.200
Nothin'. We just go back to Tommy's.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.410
We forget about the whole damn thing.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.124
After all we've been through

18:46.416 --> 18:48.168
everything I've done

18:53.632 --> 18:55.551
it can't be for nothing.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.307
I know you mean well.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.310
I know you wanna protect me.
You have.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.730
And when we're done,
we'll go wherever you want.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.693
Tommy's, sheep ranch,

19:12.693 --> 19:14.278
the moon.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.158
I'll follow you anywhere you go.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.585
But there's no halfway with this.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.005
We finish what we started.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.902
- Was this a FEDRA thing?
- No.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.237
Army.

20:40.280 --> 20:44.368
They put these places up all around,
the first few days after the outbreak.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.496
Emergency medical camps.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.790
Obviously didn't last.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.543
- They had me in one just like this.
- With Sarah?

20:53.543 --> 20:55.337
No, she was gone already.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.675
So what was wrong with you?

20:59.675 --> 21:02.260
- It was for this.
- The guy who shot and missed.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.930
I figured that would've happened later.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.931
No.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.724
Second day.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.601
I've gotta hand it to the Army people.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.478
They were way better at stitchin' you up
than I was.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.896
It was me.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.443
I was the guy who shot and missed.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.959
There's no story.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.962
Sarah died,

21:36.962 --> 21:39.506
and I couldn't see the point anymore.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.133
Simple as that.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.638
And I wasn't scared either.
I was ready.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.893
I couldn't have been more ready.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.690
When I--

22:00.068 --> 22:01.194
When I

22:02.904 --> 22:05.449
went to pull the trigger, I flinched.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.244
Still don't know why.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.083
Anyway,
the reason I'm telling you all this--

22:15.083 --> 22:17.127
I know why you're tellin' me all this.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.464
Yeah, I reckon you do.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.305
So time heals all wounds, I guess.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.769
It wasn't time that did it.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.617
Well, I'm glad that

22:50.494 --> 22:52.412
that didn't work out.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.041
Me, too.

23:03.381 --> 23:05.926
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.644
You know what I'm in the mood for?

23:15.644 --> 23:16.645
What?

23:17.145 --> 23:18.105
Shitty puns.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.908
"People are making apocalypse jokes
like there's no tomorrow."

23:30.951 --> 23:32.244
- Too soon?
- No, it's topical.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.329
I love this one.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.332
"Moon rocks taste better
than Earth rocks. Why?

23:37.999 --> 23:40.168
- 'Cause they're meteor."
- That's terrible.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.795
Fuck you. That was actually good.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.089
- That's a zero outta 10.
- All right, all right.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.092
"What did the green grape
say to the purple grape?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.594
Breathe, you idiot."

23:50.887 --> 23:52.347
That was a three outta 10.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.182
- Seven, minimum.
- I'll give it a five.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.017
- Five outta 10.
- Five?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.780
- Joel!
- Ellie.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.407
- Ellie!
- Joel!

24:43.231 --> 24:45.108
Welcome to the Fireflies.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.401
Easy.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.695
Ya got hit pretty hard.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.948
Patrol didn't know who you were.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.912
- Where's Ellie?
- She wasn't hurt.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.538
Not even a scratch.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.582
She's mostly worried about you.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.419
Where is she?

25:04.419 --> 25:07.214
We lost half our crew
crossing the country.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.257
I had five men whose only job
was to protect me.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.426
I still almost got killed.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.053
How'd you do it?

25:14.262 --> 25:16.264
It was all her.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.641
She fought like hell to get here.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.851
She would've been dead on day one.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.273
You are the one person
I never wanted to be in debt to.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.776
But I owe you.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.403
- We all owe you.
- Just take me to her.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.364
I can't.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.032
She's being prepped for surgery.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.578
What surgery?

25:40.914 --> 25:42.457
Our doctor

25:43.250 --> 25:44.918
he thinks that the Cordyceps
in Ellie has grown

25:44.918 --> 25:46.878
- with her since birth.
- Why is she in surgery?

25:46.878 --> 25:49.506
It produces a kind of chemical messenger.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.133
It makes normal Cordyceps
think that she's Cordyceps.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.301
It's why she's immune.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.595
He's gonna remove it from her,

25:55.595 --> 25:57.514
multiply the cells in a lab,

25:57.514 --> 26:00.141
produce those chemical messengers

26:00.850 --> 26:02.769
and then we can give it to everyone.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.606
He thinks it could be a cure, Joel.

26:06.606 --> 26:07.816
A cure.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.283
Cordyceps grows inside the brain.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.912
It does.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.752
- Find someone else.
- There is no one else.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.630
We didn't tell her,
we didn't cause her any fear,

26:30.630 --> 26:32.465
- there won't be any pain.
- No. No, you take me to her.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.009
You take me to her right now!

26:42.767 --> 26:45.103
Please, you don't understand.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.399
I do.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.820
I was there when she was born, Joel.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.281
I promised her mother
that I would save her child.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.907
I promised.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.161
So I do understand.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.289
I'm the only one who understands.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.046
I'm sorry.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.841
I have no other choice.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.346
I do.

27:29.064 --> 27:32.317
Walk him out to the highway,
leave him there with his pack.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.526
Give him this.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.074
He tries anything

27:39.741 --> 27:40.784
shoot him.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.661
I didn't hear anyone say, "Stop."

28:26.079 --> 28:27.247
Which way?

28:27.247 --> 28:28.665
Down the stairs.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.943
The fuck are you doin'? Keep walking.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.028
I said keep walk--

29:03.908 --> 29:05.869
- Fuck!
- Where is she?

29:07.495 --> 29:08.746
Fuck you.

29:08.746 --> 29:09.914
I don't have time for this.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.751
<i>Shots fired. Shots fired!</i>

32:04.005 --> 32:05.798
Do we have enough power?

32:10.261 --> 32:11.262
She's ready.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.601
Unhook her.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.063
- How did you get in here?
- I said unhook her.

32:20.938 --> 32:22.398
I won't let you take her.

32:24.025 --> 32:24.942
Unhook her.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.404
- Move!
- Oh, my God.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.368
Cover her arm.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.620
- Fast.
- Okay.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.792
Turn around.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.612
You can't keep her safe forever.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.701
No matter how hard you try,

33:56.701 --> 33:58.244
no matter how many people you kill,

33:58.244 --> 34:00.246
she's gonna grow up, Joel.

34:00.246 --> 34:02.749
And then you'll die. She'll leave.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.041
Then what?

34:04.041 --> 34:07.837
How long till she's torn apart by Infected
or murdered by raiders?

34:07.837 --> 34:11.174
Because she lives in a broken world
that you could have saved.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.175
Maybe.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.887
- But it isn't for you to decide.
- Or you.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.141
So what would she decide?

34:21.434 --> 34:23.478
'Cause I think she'd
wanna do what's right.

34:28.191 --> 34:30.109
And you know it.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.573
It's not too late.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.033
Even now,

34:37.033 --> 34:39.035
even after what you've done.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.746
We can still find a way.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.456
- What?
- It's all right. You're with me.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.625
Take it slow.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.628
The drugs are still wearin' off.

35:30.628 --> 35:33.631
I was with the Fireflies and then--

35:35.550 --> 35:36.968
What drugs?

35:39.053 --> 35:40.805
They were runnin' some tests on you,

35:42.473 --> 35:44.016
<i>and some others.</i>

35:46.769 --> 35:49.313
Turns out there's a whole lot more
like you.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.274
People that are immune.

35:52.358 --> 35:53.693
Dozens of 'em.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.740
And the doctors,
they couldn't make any of it work.

36:01.993 --> 36:02.910
<i>They've actually--</i>

36:07.123 --> 36:09.250
They've stopped lookin' for a cure.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.799
Where are my clothes?

36:18.718 --> 36:22.054
Raiders attacked the hospital.
I barely got ya outta there.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.307
We'll find you some new ones on the way.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.228
Were people hurt?

36:33.733 --> 36:34.650
Yes.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.490
Is Marlene okay?

36:49.999 --> 36:51.918
I'm takin' us home.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.394
I'm sorry.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.048
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

37:40.549 --> 37:41.759
Please.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.220
Let me go.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.473
You'd just come after her.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.731
Well, she got us close enough.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.947
We gotta walk the rest of the way.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.200
Probably about a five-hour hike

38:48.200 --> 38:50.036
but we can manage that.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.246
Remember?

38:53.831 --> 38:54.749
Yeah.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.761
You know, Sarah and I used to hike
like this all the time.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.682
I wouldn't say it was her favorite thing.

39:11.682 --> 39:15.019
She wasn't a fan
of the mosquitoes and such.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.647
But she was a big climber, or scampering.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.275
That's probably the right word.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.277
That girl,

39:23.277 --> 39:25.613
she'd see a big rock, and just...

39:27.948 --> 39:29.825
She woulda liked you.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.661
Not to say the two of you are the same.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.040
- Definitely different kids.
- How so?

39:37.333 --> 39:40.586
Well, she was a lot more,
I wanna say girly.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.297
- And I'm not sayin' that you're not girly.
- I'm not.

39:44.465 --> 39:47.635
Yeah, you're not.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.637
So that.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.680
She was taller.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.767
She had a killer smile.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.769
Again, not sayin' that you don't.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.772
But you know why I think she'd like you?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.190
Why?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.817
'Cause you're funny.

40:05.319 --> 40:07.238
I think you would've made her laugh.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.202
Anyway, I bet you would've liked her back.

40:14.328 --> 40:16.247
Yeah, bet I would've.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.432
There ya go.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.772
Not much further now.

40:42.857 --> 40:43.983
Hey, wait.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.113
Fuck.

40:57.204 --> 41:00.916
Back in Kansas City, you asked me about
the first time I killed someone.

41:07.256 --> 41:10.050
When I got bit in the mall,
I wasn't on my own.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.345
My best friend was there
and she got bit, too.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.849
We didn't know what to do, and she says,

41:16.849 --> 41:18.851
"We can just wait it out,

41:19.810 --> 41:22.354
be all poetic and just
lose our minds together."

41:24.023 --> 41:25.357
And then she did.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.610
And I had to--

41:30.946 --> 41:33.115
Her name was Riley

41:33.115 --> 41:35.117
and she was the first to die.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.368
And then it was Tess.

41:36.368 --> 41:37.870
- And then Sam.
- That's not on you.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.246
- I know, but--
- Look, sometimes things

41:39.246 --> 41:41.290
don't work out the way we hope.

41:41.290 --> 41:42.750
You can feel like

41:43.709 --> 41:45.628
like you've come to an end

41:46.420 --> 41:48.339
and you don't know what to do next.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.384
But if you just keep goin'

41:54.345 --> 41:56.513
you find something new to fight for.

41:56.513 --> 41:59.225
- And maybe that's not what--
- Swear to me.

42:01.393 --> 42:04.939
Swear to me that everything you said
about the Fireflies is true.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.653
I swear.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.419
Okay.
