03:55.010 --> 03:56.880
Range me.

03:59.648 --> 04:01.478
Three to five on the legs.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.930
They're coming.

04:32.448 --> 04:34.465
Scan them. Find Cabrera.

04:44.259 --> 04:46.630
At the Jeep. Designer sunglasses.

04:47.195 --> 04:48.964
You sure that's him?

04:49.064 --> 04:51.469
I'm reading his rank and name tag.

04:54.069 --> 04:55.400
He's moving.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.311
Six-5-0. Range me.

05:04.412 --> 05:06.815
Range correct, 6-5-0.

05:07.215 --> 05:10.218
When he clears the civilians he's mine.

07:16.494 --> 07:19.504
- Anything?
- Nothing.

07:35.897 --> 07:39.703
Two more hours. Damn, I hate the downtime.

07:40.101 --> 07:42.971
Well, you have a leave coming up, don't you?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.572
Yeah.

07:57.819 --> 07:59.500
That can't be our extraction.

08:02.758 --> 08:06.127
Ah, those dipshits. I told them no daylight.

08:06.627 --> 08:09.474
- Should I pop smoke?
- No. Come on.

08:09.574 --> 08:13.296
Let's get out of here before those
cheesedicks page us over the P.A. system.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.649
Come on! Come on!

10:23.298 --> 10:26.201
You're fucking crazy! He's gone down!

10:26.301 --> 10:29.137
Wait! Come back here!

10:29.437 --> 10:30.658
Beckett!

11:30.958 --> 11:34.469
Why didn't you let the door gunner
sweep it out first?

11:35.603 --> 11:38.839
My spotter is dead because
you assholes got here early.

11:38.939 --> 11:44.316
I asked for a night extraction. I ought to
leave you out there, you son of a bitch!

12:03.448 --> 12:05.700
We'll be needing both of those, Gunny.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.501
He only needs one.

13:28.283 --> 13:31.919
Colonel Weymuth, this is Richard Miller.
He'll be our man in Panama.

13:32.019 --> 13:35.859
- Mr. Miller. Heard a lot about you.
- Come on, sit down.

13:52.873 --> 13:57.712
Intelligence indicates there is a major coup
planned for election day in Panama.

13:57.812 --> 14:01.549
Colombian drug lord,
Raul Ochoa is bankrolling it.

14:01.749 --> 14:06.787
His plan is to put in rebel general,
Miguel Alvarez, in power.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.324
We have less than one week to prevent that.

14:09.424 --> 14:11.259
With this man Alvarez running the country...

14:11.359 --> 14:15.062
...Ochoa could very easily gain access
to the Panama Canal.

14:15.162 --> 14:19.515
We have only one shot at Alvarez
and it is absolutely critical...

14:19.615 --> 14:23.122
...that we eliminate the general
prior to next week's elections.

14:23.404 --> 14:28.609
Now, this operation won't bear
congressional scrutiny.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.696
It must be completely covert.

14:31.796 --> 14:34.779
You won't be getting
a medal for this, Richard...

14:34.879 --> 14:37.952
...but there will be other tangible benefits.

14:38.052 --> 14:40.073
The first one's Alvarez.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.691
Most recent photo was taken ten days ago.

14:45.393 --> 14:47.428
The ponytail's Ochoa.

14:47.528 --> 14:50.331
Ochoa is never seen outside of Colombia.

14:50.431 --> 14:54.332
That's Alvarez's <i>hacienda</i>.
That's where you'll find him.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.673
That's your shooter.

14:57.504 --> 15:01.376
Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett.
He's the Marine Corps' top man.

15:01.476 --> 15:04.612
He's logged more time
in the jungle than any other sniper.

15:04.712 --> 15:07.898
On this particular mission
your function is to be his spotter.

15:07.998 --> 15:11.086
Mr. Miller, should anything
happen to Beckett...

15:11.686 --> 15:14.889
...your duty would be
to eliminate Alvarez personally.

15:14.989 --> 15:18.359
Don't worry about having to shoot
anybody, Richard. Beckett is the best.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.495
I'm sure it wouldn't come to that.

15:20.595 --> 15:22.598
I may not have any kills...

15:24.098 --> 15:27.597
- ...but I have had men in my sights.
- Good.

15:28.202 --> 15:31.273
We're giving you rank on this one, GS-9.

15:31.806 --> 15:35.081
The mission is under your command.
It's your responsibility.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.413
Good luck, Richard.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.581
Consider it done.

15:40.681 --> 15:42.182
Gentlemen.

15:45.853 --> 15:47.724
Uh, Miller.

15:49.524 --> 15:52.760
One last thing. This assignment is critical.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.396
If at any point Beckett
becomes a liability...

15:55.496 --> 15:58.500
...or he endangers
this mission's covert status...

15:59.500 --> 16:01.201
...you're going to have to take him out.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.674
<i>Señor, viste, viste.</i> Buy one.

17:02.096 --> 17:04.127
<i>The embassy is pleased.</i>

17:04.932 --> 17:08.998
<i>They'll mark Cabrera "Confirmed kill,
classified" on your service jacket.</i>

17:09.904 --> 17:12.006
<i>We're very sorry about your spotter.</i>

17:12.106 --> 17:14.804
<i>It was a rebel sniper that got Papich.</i>

17:14.904 --> 17:16.712
<i>He's still out there.</i>

17:19.179 --> 17:22.616
You know, Washington is really excited
about these upcoming elections.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.285
Why is that, sir?

17:25.385 --> 17:28.021
Our policy is to see this country
have a freely elected government.

17:28.122 --> 17:30.163
That could happen in a couple of months.

17:34.128 --> 17:36.744
You know it will be the usual damned thing.

17:36.844 --> 17:39.075
People will be too scared to vote.

17:40.635 --> 17:43.804
Well... whatever you and I may think, Tom...

17:43.904 --> 17:47.907
...Washington feels this is the right time
to go after the rebel leadership.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.814
You're sending it my way, sir?

17:51.812 --> 17:53.614
Yes, I am.

17:54.414 --> 17:57.652
We're getting a little long in the tooth
for this kind of thing, Tom...

17:57.752 --> 18:02.186
...but I figure this would make
a great capper for a fine career.

18:04.158 --> 18:08.362
Now the National Security Council is
sending a guy along to help a shooter.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.503
He's coming with full plans.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.299
A civilian?

18:12.399 --> 18:14.609
Just hold on. Wait a minute. Take a look.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.872
The army shooting team,
plucked him right out of ROTC.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.204
He took a silver in the '88 Olympics.

18:20.304 --> 18:24.279
After his discharge, the NSC Assigned him
to a Washington, D.C. SWAT team.

18:24.379 --> 18:26.280
It's all in there. Take a look.

18:28.115 --> 18:31.852
Has he ever been in a jungle?
Does he speak any Spanish?

18:32.152 --> 18:34.654
This is not a matter of choice.

18:34.754 --> 18:39.031
Just trust me. Anybody the NSC sends
down here is going to be fully qualified.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.810
Hey, yo!

18:57.311 --> 18:59.952
What do you got in there, anyway?

19:01.281 --> 19:04.482
- A bassoon.
- A bassoon.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.855
With the Marine Corps band, right?

19:07.955 --> 19:10.925
Exactly. New psy-ops strategy.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.216
We're going to charm the rebels like snakes.

19:14.394 --> 19:16.964
Whip a charm on this.

19:17.064 --> 19:19.903
Shit, Ripoly! Whip a charm.

19:25.806 --> 19:27.637
Hey, take a swig.

19:29.009 --> 19:31.410
It'll burn through that frost you got.

19:36.684 --> 19:38.445
Ripoly!

19:39.220 --> 19:42.539
Give me your battle dressing.
Give me your battle dressing!

19:43.090 --> 19:45.171
Jesus Christ.

19:48.295 --> 19:50.326
We got wounded.

19:56.336 --> 19:58.197
Jesus Christ!

19:59.907 --> 20:02.308
Baker, stand by, stand by.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.654
Shit, we're hit!

20:17.224 --> 20:19.895
Where is he? Anyone got a visual?

20:21.528 --> 20:23.562
There he is. Kill him!

20:28.452 --> 20:31.989
- He's on your side. Get him. Get him.
- You'll get us all killed.

20:32.089 --> 20:35.710
Take it down. For Christ's sake,
take it down. He's shooting at us.

20:35.810 --> 20:38.461
Goddammit! Use your fucking weapon!

20:39.580 --> 20:41.449
Look out.

20:43.517 --> 20:47.520
We're gonna die! Oh, God, we're gonna die!

20:57.264 --> 20:59.105
Kill him.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.302
Get us out of here.

21:02.402 --> 21:04.843
Come on. There he is.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.063
Get him! Come on, let's go!

21:13.747 --> 21:15.608
Come on!

21:36.471 --> 21:39.542
Jesus Christ!
You got him with a sniper rifle.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.811
Yeah.

22:01.829 --> 22:04.531
<i>Just to make Panama green</i>

22:04.631 --> 22:07.374
- <i>Left, right, yay-o</i>
- <i>Left, right, yay-o...</i>

22:22.682 --> 22:24.583
How about a game?

22:24.684 --> 22:26.695
I got a game.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.396
- Can I get a beer?
- Coming up.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.216
Hey.

22:39.566 --> 22:42.737
So, you're going down south,
towards the border?

22:42.837 --> 22:44.905
I'm not at liberty to discuss my mission.

22:45.005 --> 22:48.526
Hey, how do you feel about
hanging on a charm bracelet?

22:51.245 --> 22:52.612
Come again?

22:52.712 --> 22:56.683
You better take a good look
at Master Beckett's dog tag collection.

22:56.783 --> 22:58.444
Got any money?

23:01.188 --> 23:03.219
Yeah, I'll play for money.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.263
I said I already got a game.

23:14.168 --> 23:18.574
I'm talking about holding onto your cash
while you're out in the jungle.

23:20.874 --> 23:22.810
Better do it, man.

23:22.910 --> 23:26.619
Those rebels can fund a whole offensive
on what they take off you.

23:29.849 --> 23:31.890
I'm ready for a game now.

23:34.421 --> 23:36.532
He doesn't have time for a game.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.989
GS-9 Miller?

23:57.044 --> 23:58.878
A lot of attitude around here.

23:58.978 --> 24:02.482
Welcome to marine world.
Those people thought you were a sniper.

24:02.582 --> 24:04.453
It's an outcast profession.

24:05.619 --> 24:08.220
Yeah, they always go out in platoon strength.

24:08.722 --> 24:11.708
We go out in pairs. Sometimes alone.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.095
Their idea of combat
is tearing up the countryside...

24:15.195 --> 24:17.726
...with heavy artillery
and millions of rounds.

24:18.865 --> 24:22.016
We'll wait days for one shot, one kill.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.785
Well... I guess it's
a different version of war.

24:30.527 --> 24:32.879
There's a lot of them and just a few of us.

24:34.048 --> 24:35.766
What's that?

24:36.316 --> 24:39.199
Sometimes these shells
get nicks and burrs on them.

24:39.299 --> 24:42.583
This little son of a bitch will take
your head off at 1,000 yards.

24:46.226 --> 24:49.097
Have you had a chance
to look over our operations plan?

24:49.563 --> 24:52.954
Yeah, I have, but I want
to study it a little more.

24:53.968 --> 24:56.303
Forget the specifics. How about an overview?

24:56.403 --> 25:00.274
We'll get to that later.
I have a few things I have to do.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.806
See you at 5.0, 500.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.982
Having had.

25:08.082 --> 25:11.141
- Having had what?
- Breakfast.

25:14.621 --> 25:16.123
Miller.

25:20.027 --> 25:22.429
This is Corporal Papich's gillie suit.

25:50.891 --> 25:52.593
Is that our ride?

25:54.561 --> 25:57.033
No. That's our ride.

25:58.565 --> 26:01.568
I thought this was a deep jungle insertion.
Don't we do that by chopper?

26:01.668 --> 26:03.806
Yeah, that's the usual S.O.P.

26:03.906 --> 26:08.823
But those asshole rudderheads at battalion,
they've fucked with me one time too many.

26:08.923 --> 26:10.941
We're going to have to walk it in.

26:30.530 --> 26:32.332
My fiancee.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.467
You married?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.092
What's that?

26:56.182 --> 26:59.459
Got it out of a catalog
when I was with D.C. Swat.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.978
- We called it "Gucci-flage."
- "Gucci-flage."

27:03.078 --> 27:05.799
- Yeah.
- You're going to wear that?

27:05.899 --> 27:08.975
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

27:22.883 --> 27:26.506
- Nice shot.
- Ain't no room for Peter Pan on this hunt.

27:26.986 --> 27:29.978
You wear Corporal Papich's
tree togs that I gave you.

27:39.133 --> 27:41.205
What the hell are those for?

27:42.702 --> 27:43.944
Respect.

28:17.871 --> 28:21.141
I still think a chopper insertion
would've made a hell of a lot more sense.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.653
By the way, that was a hell
of a shot you made from a chopper.

28:28.832 --> 28:31.268
That's the sort of thing myths are made of.

28:31.368 --> 28:33.170
Yeah, it was pretty unreal.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.660
Yeah.

28:42.862 --> 28:45.865
Roll down your sleeves, Miller.
We're going in the bush.

29:32.912 --> 29:34.414
What?

29:35.048 --> 29:37.120
What, I missed a spot?

29:38.318 --> 29:40.190
Come on, on your feet.

30:09.816 --> 30:11.985
I had a lot of SWAT training, all right?

30:12.085 --> 30:15.562
Urban anti-terrorist tactics.
I've never actually done a creep.

30:16.990 --> 30:19.192
The army ever put you in the jungle?

30:22.061 --> 30:25.753
If you call deepest, darkest
North Carolina a jungle, yeah.

30:26.099 --> 30:28.001
You want to survive this, right?

30:28.768 --> 30:30.560
One answer to that.

30:30.804 --> 30:33.251
If you do as I tell you to the letter...

30:34.428 --> 30:37.962
- ...I think you got a chance.
- Whoa, okay? Hold on.

30:38.112 --> 30:41.010
You may have a hell of a lot more experience
than I do, but with all due respect, Gunny...

30:41.110 --> 30:43.678
...this mission is NSC. Meaning...

30:43.778 --> 30:46.520
...I still have rank,
whether you see it or not.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.355
Sorry, but I don't have
to take orders from you.

30:49.455 --> 30:51.391
Fair enough.

30:51.491 --> 30:53.563
You want to take point?

30:58.231 --> 31:00.103
You're doing fine.

31:33.232 --> 31:34.934
I got it.

31:35.034 --> 31:38.304
- You sure?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.258
Goddamn!

32:00.159 --> 32:03.830
- You all right, son?
- Yeah. Son of a bitch!

32:03.930 --> 32:05.472
Hey.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.975
Relax. You did okay.

32:08.075 --> 32:11.131
Oh, thanks. Is there a wrong way
to fall down a fucking mountain?

32:11.231 --> 32:13.043
Your weapon, Miller.

32:13.673 --> 32:17.713
It's your life.
You knew that, and you saved it.

32:22.115 --> 32:23.947
You're learning, son.

32:33.259 --> 32:34.861
- Beckett.
- Hmm?

32:34.961 --> 32:38.164
Our drop point from the railway was east.

32:38.264 --> 32:41.305
- Now we're heading west, here.
- I know that.

32:42.636 --> 32:45.972
- Well, that's not the plan.
- The plan was no good.

32:46.072 --> 32:47.874
Uh, what?

32:51.878 --> 32:53.613
We're changing directions.

32:53.713 --> 32:58.051
Okay. I was given very specific orders
by the staff at the NSC.

32:58.151 --> 33:02.889
Now, first it indicated a chopper insertion
which we won't get into.

33:02.989 --> 33:06.790
Then, we were supposed to head east,
you know, due east.

33:06.890 --> 33:09.830
You think Washington knows
the best way to get through this jungle?

33:10.730 --> 33:13.132
You think they know which streams
are flooded, and impossible to cross?

33:13.232 --> 33:14.934
Which trails are mined or booby-trapped?

33:15.034 --> 33:18.475
What I know about this place, son,
is 'cause I'm here.

33:25.812 --> 33:27.814
Hup. Changing directions.

33:28.848 --> 33:30.720
Good. North.

33:37.657 --> 33:39.189
Holy shit.

33:39.759 --> 33:41.631
What the hell is that?

33:58.111 --> 33:59.673
"Hotel Europa."

34:01.147 --> 34:04.241
What kind of wacko
builds a hotel in the jungle...

34:13.559 --> 34:15.130
Beckett...

34:20.533 --> 34:22.101
Oh.

34:23.002 --> 34:25.274
Sure is a hell of a lucky break for us.

34:28.306 --> 34:31.362
<i>Descargado. Descargado.</i>

34:32.978 --> 34:35.251
I got ammo and he's laughing?

34:37.263 --> 34:41.451
Ease up, young agent. They've been
with us since we left the train.

34:41.551 --> 34:45.190
You drop the hammer on him,
we'll be dead before we even take 10 steps.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.728
- <i>Hola, Cacique. Que tal?</i>
- <i>Hola.</i>

34:48.828 --> 34:51.429
- <i>Quien es este?</i>
- <i>El?</i>

34:52.603 --> 34:54.632
<i>El es Rambo-tito.</i>

34:55.068 --> 34:56.600
<i>Rambo-tito?</i>

35:07.046 --> 35:08.878
<i>Los ojos.</i>

35:09.248 --> 35:11.300
<i>Quiero los ojos.</i>

35:11.517 --> 35:13.389
He wants my eyes?

35:15.622 --> 35:18.624
He means <i>anteojos.</i>

35:19.692 --> 35:21.527
Your shooting glasses.

35:21.627 --> 35:24.230
- Give them to him.
- Why?

35:24.330 --> 35:27.427
- Because he likes them.
- Fuck him.

35:30.904 --> 35:31.919
Look...

35:32.019 --> 35:35.453
...this area's swarming with rebel patrols.
These Indians can help us avoid them.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.841
Give him the glasses.

35:42.281 --> 35:44.123
May you go blind.

36:06.740 --> 36:08.808
Following these Indians is fucking crazy.

36:08.908 --> 36:12.245
- Their agenda works with ours.
- Their agenda? What agenda?

36:12.345 --> 36:15.381
Did you see how Cacique's hand?
Did you see the way it was cut up?

36:15.481 --> 36:18.317
The animal who did that is El Cirujano.

36:18.417 --> 36:21.608
"The Surgeon." He's headed this way
and we're gonna take him out.

36:21.708 --> 36:26.022
In return, they're gonna lead us past the
rebel patrol. We'll cut hours off our time.

36:26.122 --> 36:29.062
Our mission isn't about
assassinating people for Indians.

36:29.162 --> 36:31.831
El Cirujano is listed
as a target of opportunity.

36:31.931 --> 36:36.503
- That means, we see him, we take him out.
- Listed where? It's not in my orders.

36:36.603 --> 36:39.661
El Cirujano is gonna be
at this river up ahead and Miller...

36:39.761 --> 36:42.008
...you're designated hitter
on this one, so batter up.

36:42.108 --> 36:45.244
Wait, now hold on a second!
I'm not buying into this.

36:45.344 --> 36:49.282
And I don't buy that you shot a man
from a moving helicopter.

36:49.382 --> 36:50.917
That's got nothing to do with anything.

36:51.017 --> 36:54.594
You're going to look Cirujano in the eyes,
you're gonna put a bullet through his heart...

36:54.694 --> 36:57.724
...because until I see you kill a man,
you're a liability to this mission.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.725
That's not my purpose here!

36:59.825 --> 37:03.162
Maybe, but when we get to Alvarez's
<i>hacienda</i> there's gonna be two targets.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.898
What?

37:04.998 --> 37:08.367
Yeah, that's right.
Intelligence changes all the time.

37:08.467 --> 37:11.905
Alvarez is setting up a meeting
with a man called Raul Ochoa.

37:12.005 --> 37:14.470
He's a Colombian drug lord
that's financing the rebels.

37:14.570 --> 37:18.978
- We got a chance to get them both.
- Where does this information come from?

37:19.078 --> 37:21.014
Any new intelligence has to come through me.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.784
A local contact, Father Ruiz.
He's a priest in the village of Sangre.

37:24.884 --> 37:27.896
He'll give us specifics
on the meeting when we get there.

37:42.334 --> 37:44.738
Wind coming off the water at 3:00.

37:45.338 --> 37:47.140
One click right.

37:49.408 --> 37:51.410
Make that two clicks.

38:02.221 --> 38:05.124
Which one is he? I can't tell who he is.

38:05.224 --> 38:07.236
He's the baseball fan.

38:09.429 --> 38:13.367
- He's a fucking American.
- He's a fucking spook. Ex-CIA.

38:13.467 --> 38:15.949
I met him once up in El Salvador.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.272
Now he's an enforcer for the cocaine monkeys.

38:19.372 --> 38:23.242
I'll take out the lieutenant.
You concentrate on him.

38:24.243 --> 38:27.335
Now put a fucking bullet through his heart.

38:31.650 --> 38:34.468
Do it. Feel the rush.

38:53.973 --> 38:55.545
Miller.

38:56.175 --> 38:57.547
Breathe.

39:11.257 --> 39:13.489
Nail that motherfucker now!

39:49.428 --> 39:51.860
What the hell did you just do, sniper?

39:52.398 --> 39:54.751
I just wanted to show you
that I owned that situation.

39:54.851 --> 39:58.154
Bullshit. You fired a spoiler.

39:58.804 --> 40:02.308
- You saw him go down. He's dead.
- I didn't see shit! I didn't see him hit.

40:02.408 --> 40:04.978
For Christ's sake,
you gave him a warning shot.

40:05.078 --> 40:09.154
I hit him. I had him in my sights.
There's no doubt about it.

40:10.383 --> 40:12.225
You better be right.

40:13.652 --> 40:17.256
From now on, one shot, one kill.

40:17.356 --> 40:20.036
No exceptions. You understand?

40:37.143 --> 40:39.410
<i>Lo siento</i>, Cacique.

40:56.095 --> 40:58.297
What? Now they blame us for this?

40:59.632 --> 41:01.134
No.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.540
But this sure as hell ain't going to help us.

42:14.039 --> 42:15.541
Beckett?

42:37.196 --> 42:38.698
Patrol.

43:23.476 --> 43:26.445
You really get off on this shit,
don't you, Beckett?

43:26.545 --> 43:29.348
Uh, it's just a job.
I don't think about it much.

43:29.448 --> 43:32.185
So that's the secret, not thinking. Right.

43:33.465 --> 43:35.047
Miller...

43:36.489 --> 43:38.457
...what are you doing here?

43:38.557 --> 43:40.659
This assignment was supposed
to be a piece of cake.

43:40.759 --> 43:43.762
You're in, you're out you go
back home and reap the rewards.

43:43.862 --> 43:45.819
The Washington brass loves this shit.

43:46.799 --> 43:49.902
Of course, they never said anything about
a goddamn jungle creep, that's for sure.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.504
Yeah, well, most guys wouldn't.

43:53.372 --> 43:55.541
Seems so far away.

43:55.641 --> 43:58.619
- What?
- My life.

44:01.314 --> 44:05.949
I read your dossier before I came.
You had 74 confirmed kills.

44:07.019 --> 44:11.467
It's not about numbers. The only one
that really mattered was the first one.

44:12.625 --> 44:14.828
That was the toughest one for you, right?

44:15.694 --> 44:17.097
First one?

44:18.230 --> 44:19.543
Yeah.

44:21.467 --> 44:23.540
But 74, that's...

44:24.303 --> 44:26.236
...a lot of faces to carry around.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.043
Yeah, well...

44:30.443 --> 44:32.486
...you put them in the back of your mind...

44:34.029 --> 44:35.785
...and you just keep on going.

44:35.885 --> 44:39.348
That's great until they decide
not to stay in the back of your mind.

44:40.819 --> 44:42.921
You may find this hard to believe...

44:43.021 --> 44:45.824
...but I'll take a nice office on the hill
over this shit any day.

44:45.924 --> 44:48.499
Sitting in an office,
giving other men orders to kill...

44:48.599 --> 44:51.697
...ain't no different than putting
a bullet in a man's heart.

44:51.797 --> 44:53.600
Let me tell you something.

44:54.133 --> 44:57.076
It's the same goddamn thing.

45:03.242 --> 45:05.885
- You hear that?
- An AK.

45:06.779 --> 45:09.277
- I know that hammer recoil.
- Yeah...

45:09.377 --> 45:12.084
...and I think I know
who that single shot is.

45:12.184 --> 45:14.057
He's behind us.

45:39.745 --> 45:41.447
Who is this guy?

45:41.547 --> 45:43.682
I think he's the guy that killed Papich.

45:43.782 --> 45:46.385
It ain't the first time
he's been on my trail.

45:46.685 --> 45:48.948
He's a Panamanian I trained.

45:50.456 --> 45:55.131
His name is Desilva
and now he's a fucking mercenary.

46:16.015 --> 46:18.278
This is ridiculous. I can't sleep here.

46:18.984 --> 46:20.953
It's a good spot.

46:21.053 --> 46:22.555
Stagnant.

46:22.655 --> 46:25.457
River flukes, leaches, malaria.

46:25.557 --> 46:28.527
He'd never think anybody
would be stupid enough to hide here.

46:28.627 --> 46:30.430
Except us.

46:30.963 --> 46:33.236
Just take your horse pill...

46:34.367 --> 46:38.441
...and don't take a piss. The bugs
will swim right up through your dick.

46:39.004 --> 46:40.877
Good night.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.565
Tough, huh?

47:43.469 --> 47:46.465
He's there. And he's out of range, dammit!

47:46.705 --> 47:51.058
I'm looking right at the ridge we came over.
I don't see a damn thing.

47:51.158 --> 47:54.008
That's because he's smarter than you.
Come over here.

48:07.225 --> 48:09.762
Glance down to the bottom of the finger.

48:09.862 --> 48:13.432
Sweep up to your left at your 11:00, halfway.

48:13.532 --> 48:15.335
Got him.

48:16.101 --> 48:17.936
Heading west.

48:18.336 --> 48:20.038
He's lost us.

48:20.138 --> 48:23.817
Wrong. He's just doing
what he was trained to do.

48:26.011 --> 48:28.614
He's circling our flank, coming around us.

48:28.981 --> 48:30.584
Gaining some ground.

48:31.517 --> 48:33.757
He'll be waiting for us somewhere.

48:37.055 --> 48:39.258
He'll know exactly where we are.

48:39.958 --> 48:41.831
We have to take him out.

48:59.578 --> 49:02.381
- Taking a break?
- Mmm-hmm.

49:11.456 --> 49:13.526
Makes it sensitive.

49:13.626 --> 49:15.761
Marries my finger to the trigger break.

49:15.861 --> 49:18.104
What are you going to do, a pedicure next?

49:20.733 --> 49:24.401
I guess some men are born
to this work and others aren't.

49:25.238 --> 49:27.573
It may be your career choice, pal,
but it ain't mine.

49:27.673 --> 49:31.910
This career chooses a man.
Ain't the other way around.

49:32.010 --> 49:34.647
Like I said, I got other plans.

49:34.747 --> 49:38.351
Yeah? I had plans.

49:38.451 --> 49:40.024
Still do.

49:43.555 --> 49:45.491
What is it?

49:45.591 --> 49:48.064
I'm working on something back home.

49:49.928 --> 49:53.365
- Where you from?
- Montana.

49:53.465 --> 49:56.932
- Bozeman.
- Oh, shit. I went to university there.

49:59.772 --> 50:03.141
Miller, don't jerk me off.
I'm not in the mood.

50:03.241 --> 50:05.711
I'm not. Freshman and sophomore year.

50:05.811 --> 50:08.681
I would've stayed longer
but skiing killed my grades.

50:08.781 --> 50:10.283
Huh.

50:10.683 --> 50:12.526
Well, I'll be damned.

50:15.620 --> 50:18.791
You, uh, you wouldn't happen to know
a little town called Livingston would you?

50:18.891 --> 50:20.434
Sure.

50:21.894 --> 50:23.707
Well, uh...

50:24.396 --> 50:27.599
...there's a stream nearby up in the hills.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.637
It's... I don't know,
three klicks east of the interstate.

50:31.737 --> 50:34.773
You follow that, and you come to this, uh...

50:34.873 --> 50:38.643
...rock basin, like a quarry pit,
but not as deep.

50:38.743 --> 50:40.613
Found that when I was a kid.

50:40.913 --> 50:44.817
Anyway, it's fed by a tributary
of the Madisons...

50:44.917 --> 50:48.620
...and it's the best damn steelhead
fishing in the world.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.967
I plan to go back there, and...

50:51.690 --> 50:56.189
...I don't know, start a little fishing camp,
a guide operation, whatever.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.649
When's the last time you were there?

51:02.067 --> 51:03.940
Couple years ago.

51:05.138 --> 51:07.339
Damn it, Gunny,
a couple of years ago, they...

51:07.439 --> 51:10.770
...that whole area was leveled seven
years ago. They got a high school there.

51:10.870 --> 51:14.356
Your pond is buried.
They got a tennis court on that site.

51:18.150 --> 51:20.553
We're not talking about the same place.

51:21.053 --> 51:24.097
You know we are whether you admit it or not.

51:25.724 --> 51:27.837
Beckett, killing's all you got, isn't it?

51:56.454 --> 51:58.297
What is it?

52:19.644 --> 52:21.717
Something is wrong here.

53:55.140 --> 53:56.943
God.

53:58.777 --> 54:00.650
What kind of...

54:01.479 --> 54:03.552
Who would do something like that?

54:07.219 --> 54:10.388
I'd say the man you had dead
in your sights did this.

54:10.488 --> 54:13.258
You don't know it as El Cirujano.
It was probably one of Alvarez's men.

54:13.358 --> 54:15.561
They probably found out
what the priest was doing.

54:15.661 --> 54:19.204
He must've told them everything. That
means they're going to be waiting for us.

54:19.304 --> 54:20.824
Maybe...

54:21.315 --> 54:25.368
...but if he told them everything
why didn't they hit us here?

54:44.322 --> 54:46.595
<i>Hacienda's</i> only three klicks away.

54:47.860 --> 54:49.995
We should make our shots easy at dawn.

54:50.095 --> 54:52.898
What? This mission is over.

54:53.665 --> 54:56.935
Our contact is dead! All we do
now is get the hell out of here!

54:57.035 --> 54:59.705
I've never turned back on a mission
in my life and I ain't starting now.

54:59.805 --> 55:03.341
That's gung-ho bullshit. Without
the specifics, it's a suicide mission.

55:03.441 --> 55:07.379
They're all suicide missions. I wouldn't
be out here unless I was ready to die.

55:07.479 --> 55:10.883
Now, we've got our location, we've got
our targets and we've got a time frame.

55:10.983 --> 55:13.256
You're out of your fucking mind.

55:13.618 --> 55:15.491
I'm not going.

55:25.530 --> 55:27.206
I've had enough of your mewling.

55:27.306 --> 55:29.553
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- I'm not going with you, Beckett.

55:29.653 --> 55:32.905
The hell you aren't.
You don't have any choice about it.

55:34.206 --> 55:38.201
- It will never work!
- We're going where they'll never expect us.

56:16.248 --> 56:19.421
Jarhead. Fucking flattop lifer.

56:57.622 --> 56:59.425
We camp here.

57:00.325 --> 57:03.359
We'll make our final approach
to the <i>hacienda</i> at dawn.

57:03.562 --> 57:05.430
Wait a minute, okay?

57:05.530 --> 57:08.634
Now, at the village you said that we were
three klicks away from the <i>hacienda</i>.

57:08.734 --> 57:12.070
Okay, now, that's three klicks.
Now, we walking for miles.

57:12.170 --> 57:14.373
We don't walk in straight lines.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.816
Now, get some sleep. I'll take first watch.

57:18.843 --> 57:21.086
Move out at 0400.

57:23.215 --> 57:25.018
You can sleep here.

01:00:49.421 --> 01:00:51.894
Son of a bitch! You used me as bait?

01:00:54.926 --> 01:00:57.129
You were never really in any danger.

01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:28.684
We're about 100 yards up.

01:01:29.327 --> 01:01:31.463
This is our rendezvous point.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:34.432
If I don't show you cross-country it
to the nearest river...

01:01:34.532 --> 01:01:37.457
- ...follow it down stream to the coast.
- Whatever.

01:02:01.592 --> 01:02:03.225
<i>Hacienda</i>, 12:00.

01:02:06.263 --> 01:02:08.706
Most logical position would be...

01:02:08.806 --> 01:02:11.422
...to take our shots
from that treeline over there...

01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:14.443
...but they're gonna be expecting that...

01:02:14.543 --> 01:02:18.843
...so somehow we got to get
in the clear to make our shots.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:20.978
When Ochoa arrives...

01:02:21.078 --> 01:02:24.649
...I figure we got ten seconds
after they greet...

01:02:24.749 --> 01:02:26.546
...and then we drop them...

01:02:26.646 --> 01:02:29.170
...and we got to fire
our shots simultaneously...

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:31.549
...or they're gonna vector
in on our positions.

01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:36.794
Here's Ochoa.

01:02:36.894 --> 01:02:38.707
He's yours.

01:02:49.707 --> 01:02:52.950
There's a clear shot from that metal utilities
shed and you got fair coverage there.

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.949
That's your position.

01:02:55.347 --> 01:02:57.649
I'll be on the other side of the village.

01:02:57.749 --> 01:02:59.551
We'll both be...

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:02.024
...thousand yards out.

01:03:04.055 --> 01:03:05.918
You listening, Miller?

01:03:08.626 --> 01:03:10.489
Get below.

01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:19.568
Miller?

01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:26.411
There better not be any doubt
about your shot this time.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:28.734
One shot, one kill.

01:03:29.714 --> 01:03:33.851
This ain't a fucking game out here.
You blow it, and I'll...

01:03:33.951 --> 01:03:37.154
You'll what? You'll kill me?

01:03:37.254 --> 01:03:39.156
Go on, say it, Beckett.

01:03:39.256 --> 01:03:41.259
You just get it right.

01:05:32.436 --> 01:05:34.309
You son of a bitch.

01:06:14.378 --> 01:06:16.351
You lying bastard.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:32.634
Fucking truck's blocking my shot.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:08.300
What are you doing?

01:10:51.588 --> 01:10:52.821
<i>Estamos aquí.</i>

01:10:56.659 --> 01:10:58.502
Where is he?

01:11:09.006 --> 01:11:10.809
Ah, shit, Miller.

01:11:14.746 --> 01:11:16.549
You're out in the open.

01:11:35.366 --> 01:11:37.499
Shit, Miller, someone's seen you.

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:41.105
<i>Flores, vengan, vengan.</i>

01:11:53.116 --> 01:11:54.919
What are you doing?

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:31.956
Alvarez.

01:12:42.966 --> 01:12:44.529
Ochoa.

01:12:52.406 --> 01:12:55.012
Ten, nine...

01:12:55.712 --> 01:12:58.649
...eight, seven...

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.295
Lady, move.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.863
One...

01:13:13.797 --> 01:13:16.230
One. Beckett. One.

01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:40.004
Oh, shit.

01:16:55.551 --> 01:16:56.440
Did you get Ochoa?

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.523
Yes, I got Ochoa! What happened to you?
What the hell were you doing in that barn?

01:16:59.623 --> 01:17:03.230
It doesn't matter. We got to try and
get back and hit Alvarez after dark.

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:05.862
What, another shot?
What are you, fucking crazy?

01:17:05.962 --> 01:17:08.809
- I got my kill! I'm out of this mission!
- There's still two targets left...

01:17:08.909 --> 01:17:11.513
- That's because you fucked up!
- You son of a bitch!

01:17:11.613 --> 01:17:15.306
He had the drop on you! He had you
in his cross hairs, and I took him out!

01:17:15.406 --> 01:17:18.339
Fuck you! I'm not ending up
on your fucking key chain!

01:19:37.901 --> 01:19:39.750
Give it up, Miller!

01:19:52.763 --> 01:19:54.996
You're losing it! Pull it together!

01:20:11.648 --> 01:20:13.441
Beautiful.

01:20:22.976 --> 01:20:24.779
<i>No te muevas.</i>

01:21:41.672 --> 01:21:43.339
Miller.

01:21:43.439 --> 01:21:46.343
- It's over.
- I'm out of bullets.

01:21:47.043 --> 01:21:48.916
Do it.

01:21:51.248 --> 01:21:53.481
So come on and shoot me, already.

01:21:54.885 --> 01:21:56.688
Do you feel the rush?

01:21:58.689 --> 01:22:00.491
Well, I felt it.

01:22:00.891 --> 01:22:03.264
I felt it when I had you in my crosshairs.

01:22:03.994 --> 01:22:05.867
After you pull the trigger...

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:09.670
...when the rush is over...

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.437
...it hurts.

01:22:14.037 --> 01:22:15.420
Doesn't it?

01:22:16.572 --> 01:22:19.615
The hurt you're feeling now
ain't the worst pain.

01:22:21.712 --> 01:22:23.555
The worst thing...

01:22:26.116 --> 01:22:28.199
...is not feeling the hurt anymore.

01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.864
You'll get past this.

01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:36.363
You'll get by.

01:22:38.361 --> 01:22:39.934
Hey.

01:22:40.964 --> 01:22:42.837
You can still go home.

01:22:54.377 --> 01:22:55.950
Miller.

01:22:58.214 --> 01:23:00.857
We got to get out of here. I'll cover you.

01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:06.324
No.

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:12.161
Son. I'm getting you out of here. Now go.

01:23:17.167 --> 01:23:18.700
Hey.

01:23:19.169 --> 01:23:21.004
I'll be right behind you.

01:23:21.604 --> 01:23:23.477
Move it.

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:26.067
Tell me who you are.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:31.095
Lee Harvey Oswald.

01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:41.202
We've been looking for you.

01:26:43.339 --> 01:26:45.275
<i>Hijo de puta.</i>

01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:47.343
You've hurt our cause.

01:26:47.443 --> 01:26:50.456
Well, fuck you and fuck your cause.

01:26:53.616 --> 01:26:55.419
<i>Es el Beckett.</i>

01:26:58.354 --> 01:26:59.890
Well...

01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:03.988
...all things come to he
who waits. Right, Beckett?

01:27:06.329 --> 01:27:08.164
Long time no see.

01:27:08.764 --> 01:27:10.807
See if there's any others.

01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:15.709
Oh, Beckett and I are going to have
a long talk. We'll hear about everything.

01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:29.023
<i>Amarren las manos.</i>

01:27:39.395 --> 01:27:41.464
Everyone back to the <i>hacienda.</i>

01:27:41.564 --> 01:27:43.634
<i>Vuelvan a la hacienda.</i>

01:27:53.443 --> 01:27:55.846
Feel the trigger, sniper.

01:27:56.746 --> 01:27:58.779
It will be the last time.

01:28:17.733 --> 01:28:19.946
So, where did you leave your partner?

01:28:33.716 --> 01:28:37.520
Now you targeted Ochoa. A Colombian civilian.

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:41.006
Is the U.S. Military now moving
against the Colombian cartel?

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:59.943
Thomas Beckett, Master Gunnery Sergeant...

01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:03.486
...United States Marine Corps!

01:29:16.993 --> 01:29:19.266
I like your dedication, Beckett.

01:29:21.164 --> 01:29:23.037
It's a challenge.

01:30:49.252 --> 01:30:52.188
Wake up. Don't die on me yet, Beckett.

01:30:52.288 --> 01:30:54.507
I'm just starting to have fun.

01:31:12.808 --> 01:31:14.311
Miller.

01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:19.086
Wait.

01:31:21.317 --> 01:31:22.850
Wait?

01:31:25.354 --> 01:31:26.822
Please.

01:31:26.922 --> 01:31:30.723
One shot, two kills.

01:31:30.993 --> 01:31:32.856
One shot...

01:31:33.587 --> 01:31:35.447
...two kills?

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.754
A man...

01:31:39.359 --> 01:31:41.254
...in your organization.

01:31:42.838 --> 01:31:45.709
- What?
- A man...

01:31:48.994 --> 01:31:50.687
What?

01:31:51.831 --> 01:31:53.404
Move.

01:32:46.869 --> 01:32:48.738
I'm gonna go one klick, can you make it?

01:32:48.838 --> 01:32:50.340
Yeah.

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:53.013
Let's go.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:55.938
One minute to rendezvous.

01:32:56.038 --> 01:32:59.045
They better be there. Take her down.

01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:25.908
- Beckett, go!
- Give me that rifle. I'll cover you.

01:33:26.008 --> 01:33:28.681
Go on! That's an order.

01:33:59.575 --> 01:34:00.870
Miller!

01:34:38.914 --> 01:34:40.427
Beckett!

01:34:44.986 --> 01:34:46.630
Let's go!

01:35:07.409 --> 01:35:08.912
Beckett.

01:35:10.395 --> 01:35:12.108
There's always Montana.
