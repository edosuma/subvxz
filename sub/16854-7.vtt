I was more of a...bookworm
more than anything, you know?

08:09.550 --> 08:11.752
I didn't like the sports
or anything like that.

know, escape in a book.

modern way is pork buns.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.027
There's only one thing to do...

08:21.062 --> 08:22.295
The future way.

08:23.429 --> 08:27.066
I'm going to write this letter
to a doctor in the future,

08:27.100 --> 08:31.103
and I'm gonna tell him to come back
here to today and bring with him

08:31.171 --> 08:35.674
medical supplies from the future to
today in order to cure this kid.

is our patient?

right, just a moment.

Thank you, future doctor.

09:06.106 --> 09:08.240
Dr. Greenberg: Oh, well,
I should thank you.

09:08.275 --> 09:11.143
You know, the note you wrote is
considered an important medical

09:11.177 --> 09:13.946
text and is on display at our
museum of medicine and science.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.081
It's an honor to meet
the authors in person.

well, very well done.

09:18.019 --> 09:18.452
Yes.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.522
Now, uh, the only problem is
that you did set off a chain of

09:22.556 --> 09:25.758
events that created a
dystopian apocalyptic future.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.993
So some people have mixed
feelings about you.

09:28.028 --> 09:28.794
Chief: Understandable.

09:28.929 --> 09:31.197
Dr. Greenberg: I really should
go now, uh, before they find me.

Um, who's gonna be our next president?

Oh, I'd like to know, what's
the weather tomorrow?

I'm renting, so is it really
necessary for me to own a lawn

09:49.615 --> 09:51.049
mower, or is that just...

09:51.083 --> 09:52.184
Dr. Greenberg: Well, it depends
how long your lease is

09:52.218 --> 09:53.418
and how often you mow.

09:53.486 --> 09:54.820
Blake: What does that have
to do with the future?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.188

Like, you could know anything
you want in the world.

09:58.324 --> 10:01.193
I could've told you that, that having
a lawn mower... I would say no.

month-to-month after that.
