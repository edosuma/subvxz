01:40.607 --> 01:43.644
Did you know this fucking walkway
connected us? 

01:45.447 --> 01:49.998
Several of your patrons, in different
stages of undress, have illuminated me.

01:50.647 --> 01:51.966
What happened there?

01:53.247 --> 01:57.035
Not only was my press disabled,
but my office was ransacked...

01:57.127 --> 01:59.402
and faeces mounded in the corner.

01:59.927 --> 02:04.318
A message of objection to my handling
of Yankton's notice on the claims.

02:04.447 --> 02:06.438
Posting rather than publishing.

02:06.967 --> 02:10.084
The camp's new schoolteacher,
a lovely woman...

02:10.287 --> 02:13.040
was so traumatised by what happened
that she left!

02:14.887 --> 02:16.115
Cy Tolliver?

02:16.567 --> 02:19.923
Who didn't even trouble,
when confronted, to deny it.

02:24.767 --> 02:28.362
- Why ain't you up and running again?
- I'm in despair.

02:29.727 --> 02:34.005
The physical damage is repairable, but
the psychic wound may be permanent.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.397
You ever been beaten, Merrick?

02:43.967 --> 02:46.959
Once,
when I thought I had the smallpox...

02:47.047 --> 02:49.800
Doc Cochran slapped me in the face.

02:53.527 --> 02:56.405
- Stop it, Al.
- Are you dead?

02:57.767 --> 03:01.316
Well, I'm in pain,
but no, I'm obviously not dead.

03:01.487 --> 03:04.559
And obviously you didn't fucking die
when the doc slapped you.

03:04.647 --> 03:06.717
- No.
- So including last night...

03:06.807 --> 03:10.163
that's three fucking damage incidents
that didn't kill you.

03:10.927 --> 03:13.919
Pain or damage don't end the world...

03:14.367 --> 03:17.359
or despair, or fucking beatings.

03:19.167 --> 03:20.964
The world ends when you're dead.

03:22.087 --> 03:25.318
Until then,
you got more punishment in store.

03:25.727 --> 03:29.436
Stand it like a man,
and give some back.

03:59.887 --> 04:02.845
You use pigs, too, Lee,
getting rid of bodies...

04:02.927 --> 04:05.202
or some other disposal method?

04:09.367 --> 04:11.483
I don't bandy my secrets either.

04:23.727 --> 04:25.160
- Joanie.
- Thanks for the loan, Jack.

04:25.247 --> 04:26.282
Sure.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.484
$100 extra is in the wrap
you'll hurt my feelings not to take.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.124
What are you
fucking tipping your hat at?

04:47.207 --> 04:50.882
- Like one human being to another.
- Glorified fucking monkey.

04:57.367 --> 04:58.846
Joanie Stubbs.

05:00.887 --> 05:02.525
How's things at your place?

05:04.367 --> 05:07.598
- There's just me left.
- I see.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.319
Could you tell me
what happened to those girls?

05:15.407 --> 05:16.999
All six?

05:17.087 --> 05:19.601
I'm asking after my friend Maddie...

05:19.687 --> 05:22.724
and Doris that you sent
to work with us...

05:22.807 --> 05:25.879
and an outside whore,
pretty-looking, like a doll.

05:25.967 --> 05:28.401
That, far as I know,
when I left Wolcott there last night...

05:28.487 --> 05:31.524
to come and get you,
was all three still alive.

05:31.607 --> 05:34.121
I'd be curious what happened
to the other three.

05:34.207 --> 05:38.519
They're sent away, Cy,
never to return or be a problem.

05:39.567 --> 05:43.526
As I won't be either to you or Wolcott.

05:44.407 --> 05:49.276
And I ask after Maddie and Doris and
the outside girl, not making a problem...

05:50.327 --> 05:53.603
but if Wolcott killed them, and
there's remains, to see them buried.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.564
There's no remains.

06:01.327 --> 06:02.396
All right.

06:06.887 --> 06:10.880
And you're there now by yourself.
Chez Ami.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.885
It's no picnic, is it, honey,
running pussy?

06:51.727 --> 06:53.206
- It's E.B., Al.
- Yeah, come in!

06:55.007 --> 06:57.521
- Morning, Al.
- Request of the widow Garret, E.B...

06:58.567 --> 07:00.717
that I may be allowed
to pay a call on her.

07:00.807 --> 07:01.956
Today?

07:02.487 --> 07:05.843
- Shall I tell her time is of the essence?
- When ain't it?

07:08.607 --> 07:11.440
- I'll aim for early afternoon.
- Stop walking with me, E.B.

07:11.527 --> 07:12.596
Yes, of course.

07:15.567 --> 07:20.402
And if she pries and pokes
and prods me to elicit your intentions?

07:20.767 --> 07:22.723
Tell her I wouldn't say.

07:24.847 --> 07:28.840
- And if she asks me why you wouldn't?
- Say you're a pain in my balls...

07:28.927 --> 07:32.920
that can't desist from inquiry
till told to shut his fucking mouth...

07:33.007 --> 07:35.646
and act on the task
he was asked to fucking do!

07:35.727 --> 07:38.685
Yes, sir. Fine. Thank you.

07:56.007 --> 07:57.122
Hello.

07:58.287 --> 08:02.075
It was bad. There's three gone.
I know it was bad.

08:02.927 --> 08:06.476
If you mean the three I saw off,
I'm certain they're safe.

08:06.567 --> 08:08.398
No, they're dead.

08:09.327 --> 08:12.205
- A different three?
- My partner and two girls.

08:13.567 --> 08:16.798
- Of what, Miss Stubbs?
- They'd been killed.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.522
And she must have come here for that.

08:20.207 --> 08:22.960
'Cause she would have shot him
and not been scared.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.686
She wasn't scared of any man,
first I ever met.

08:26.367 --> 08:27.436
I see.

08:27.527 --> 08:31.440
My mama feared my daddy, and I did,
and my sisters, too.

08:31.967 --> 08:35.004
I never met a girl till Maddie
wasn't afraid of men.

08:35.366 --> 08:37.198
And Maddie's dead now?

08:37.287 --> 08:39.801
And Carrie, her girl she brought...

08:39.886 --> 08:43.357
and Doris,
who Cy made come with us to spy.

08:43.447 --> 08:46.439
And the place, empty of any sign...

08:46.527 --> 08:48.995
that they was ever born
or lived or got killed.

08:49.087 --> 08:50.918
- And it was Cy Tolliver killed them?
- No.

08:51.007 --> 08:53.805
It was a man named Wolcott
killed them.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.957
- That works for George Hearst.
- Why?

08:58.327 --> 09:01.205
I don't know that. I'm not a man.

09:04.927 --> 09:07.395
I believe I know Wolcott to look at.

09:08.527 --> 09:11.917
This is secret, Charlie.
It's only between us.

09:13.727 --> 09:17.606
- I told you as a friend.
- And that's how I heard it.

09:19.287 --> 09:23.758
I'm your friend. Don't ever walk past me.

09:38.367 --> 09:41.996
- Them chinks ain't pulling, Mr T.
- Even at a dime a fuck.

09:42.807 --> 09:44.843
What's been your approach?

09:45.847 --> 09:49.396
- Cost, primarily. Inexpensiveness.
- The dime.

09:49.647 --> 09:52.286
I'd go with the strangeness, boys.

09:52.447 --> 09:55.757
Take it head on,
turn it to your fucking advantage.

09:58.167 --> 10:02.285
Among humans, for grip,
the Chinawoman's snatch has no peer.

10:02.807 --> 10:06.641
In all of nature,
the python is its only rival...

10:06.727 --> 10:10.276
though few have lived to tell the tale.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.684
We are dwarfs
in the company of a giant.

10:22.207 --> 10:24.880
Mind where you stomp your fucking feet!

10:26.247 --> 10:27.805
Are you... Are you addressing me?

10:28.447 --> 10:31.519
Too late to catch the one
who taught you your fucking manners!

10:33.367 --> 10:34.561
Mr Farnum?

10:34.647 --> 10:37.719
A selection of choice humbles
for the little girl.

10:40.047 --> 10:43.756
How adorably she sniffs at
the tang of freshness in the kidneys.

10:44.007 --> 10:46.521
We've finished our meal, Mr Farnum.

10:51.967 --> 10:56.279
Mrs Garret. Here.
Mr Swearengen, ma'am...

10:57.527 --> 11:00.280
with whom your deceased husband
had acquaintance...

11:00.367 --> 11:03.803
though I believe you yourself
did not request an interview.

11:08.527 --> 11:11.280
Tell Mr Swearengen
I will receive him at 2:00.

11:15.887 --> 11:19.243
- A penny for your thoughts.
- I'm glad to be leaving your company.

11:20.287 --> 11:22.881
And as to the purpose of the meeting?

11:23.407 --> 11:27.559
- Didn't Mr Swearengen confide?
- He hasn't been well.

11:32.327 --> 11:34.477
That's twice
you've fucking stared at me.

11:34.567 --> 11:38.082
- I feel you breathing on my neck.
- Should I exhale out my ass?

11:38.167 --> 11:40.123
And I believe
you're doing it intentionally.

11:40.207 --> 11:43.279
Why? You think I believe
you're a fucking cunt?

11:45.527 --> 11:48.087
If we fight, it won't be a casual matter.

11:48.687 --> 11:52.282
Oh. I see you got
your big fucking knife there.

11:52.687 --> 11:55.121
And hid somewhere on your persons
you've probably got...

11:55.207 --> 11:57.641
some pussified shooting instrument.

11:58.247 --> 12:02.286
But I am good at first impressions,
and you are a fucking cunt!

12:02.447 --> 12:06.406
And I doubt you've fought many men,
maybe even one.

12:08.847 --> 12:09.996
Beat it!

12:13.927 --> 12:18.000
And know how it fucking feels
to be helpless.

12:18.847 --> 12:22.601
And have no one
fucking stick up for you!

12:22.687 --> 12:24.564
Come on! Get up!

12:36.767 --> 12:38.803
I'll be at Swearengen's place.

12:49.887 --> 12:50.956
Charlie!

12:53.447 --> 12:56.644
- What did he do, Charlie?
- Personal fucking business!

13:06.927 --> 13:09.680
Bullock stepped in.
Tolliver's still headed towards us.

13:09.767 --> 13:10.995
Yeah?

13:11.087 --> 13:13.726
2:00, my hotel, the widow Garret's suite.

13:13.807 --> 13:16.924
- What do you know of the fisticuffs?
- Amongst who?

13:17.207 --> 13:20.677
Utter and that fella you was sitting with
downstairs the other day.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.802
Wolcott?

13:21.887 --> 13:24.196
Just now, when I was leaving the hotel...

13:24.287 --> 13:27.757
Wolcott had accidentally
stepped on Utter's foot.

13:27.847 --> 13:30.680
If Utter's got corns,
that might could have touched it off.

13:31.087 --> 13:32.520
Tolliver wanted to see me.

13:33.367 --> 13:34.880
Should I bring him up?

13:34.967 --> 13:36.878
Tell him I'll come down.

13:37.127 --> 13:40.164
Charlie Utter drove a wagon
out of camp last night...

13:40.247 --> 13:42.317
and that whore
that used to work for Tolliver...

13:42.407 --> 13:44.443
was talking to someone
hidden in the wagon bed.

13:44.527 --> 13:47.121
You connect that
with the beating in the thoroughfare?

13:47.207 --> 13:49.596
Sooner than on Utter's corns.

13:49.887 --> 13:52.924
I will station myself downstairs
as an observer.

13:53.007 --> 13:55.726
Yeah, and I will urinate
before meeting Tolliver...

13:55.807 --> 13:58.640
and I can avoid
your fucking hovering, huh?

14:01.687 --> 14:04.281
Take your fucking hands off me
and I'll take it fucking easy!

14:04.367 --> 14:05.561
You'll stay put?

14:06.007 --> 14:09.477
- Don't fucking order me around!
- I'm taking them off.

14:15.807 --> 14:18.685
And please don't go back outside.

14:23.647 --> 14:24.796
What happened?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.878
Cocksucker stepped on my toe.

14:34.727 --> 14:37.685
Moving somewhat rheumatic,
young man.

14:38.167 --> 14:40.806
God, he's always dragging
that fucking leg.

14:41.287 --> 14:43.482
Early morning fucking chill.

14:44.567 --> 14:45.966
In which our deputy sheriff Utter...

14:46.047 --> 14:47.924
just kicked the living crap
out of a citizen.

14:48.007 --> 14:50.077
How does that impinge on men like us?

14:50.167 --> 14:53.796
Man beaten is chief geologist
in the Hearst operation.

14:53.887 --> 14:55.525
Hearst of the Comstock.

14:55.607 --> 14:57.279
Hadn't you heard at all
they were around?

14:57.367 --> 15:00.006
Wrong response, no matter
what the fucking provocation.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.206
Amen, brother.

15:06.167 --> 15:08.635
How do you suggest we proceed?

15:09.567 --> 15:14.243
Maybe convene with Bullock and Utter,
discover the details.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.159
Let it be known
that's the wrong ox to gore.

15:21.807 --> 15:23.843
I'll put together a sit-down.

15:37.007 --> 15:41.285
What can you tell me, Doctor,
of the man with whom I disagreed?

15:41.607 --> 15:45.919
Richardson, who summoned me,
said it was Charlie Utter...

15:46.447 --> 15:48.881
used to be
Wild Bill Hickok's best friend.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.635
I see.

15:51.127 --> 15:53.357
Several of your ribs are broken.

15:54.727 --> 15:59.039
If you wish to occupy yourself in plaster,
I could make some up.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.636
I'll occupy myself otherwise.

16:07.527 --> 16:09.324
My fee is $3.

16:12.127 --> 16:14.402
Does your path cross Mr Utter's,
Doctor?

16:15.007 --> 16:16.565
Sometimes.

16:16.807 --> 16:21.756
You might tell him that I own a letter
said to be his best friend's last.

16:23.087 --> 16:27.239
If he would call on me,
I would consider giving it to him.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.920
If I do deliver the message...

16:33.607 --> 16:35.962
will there be a renewal of the violence?

16:36.047 --> 16:40.518
Oh, I hope not, Doctor.
I didn't do well in the original.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.361
- Al. A new suit?
- No.

17:12.967 --> 17:16.561
The ruddy health of your complexion
may bring the pattern out differently.

17:16.646 --> 17:19.115
- I'll see you to the widow's chambers.
- Go back.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.161
Of course.

17:23.487 --> 17:24.886
Room 2, on the left.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.639
Hearst's man convalesces
just to your right.

17:32.047 --> 17:33.799
One thing at a time, huh?

17:43.927 --> 17:45.280
Mr Swearengen.

17:46.607 --> 17:51.158
Mrs Garret. How do you do?
Thanks for seeing me.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.400
Will you sit down?

18:09.767 --> 18:13.521
Late congratulations
on the claim proving out.

18:14.087 --> 18:17.602
I had urged patience on your husband
before he had his mishap.

18:18.087 --> 18:21.477
And yet I've always assumed
after my husband's death...

18:22.207 --> 18:25.040
you tried to buy from me
through Mr Farnum.

18:28.247 --> 18:29.965
May I go downstairs?

18:30.167 --> 18:33.603
Mr Swearengen's only come to talk,
Sofia.

18:35.287 --> 18:36.845
You read in here.

18:47.567 --> 18:49.842
- You frighten her.
- I'll have that effect.

18:49.927 --> 18:53.602
I think, specifically,
it was your plotting against her life.

18:54.087 --> 18:57.045
- I'd take tea.
- What do you wish to discuss?

18:57.567 --> 19:00.035
The child's tutor you recently sacked.

19:00.127 --> 19:02.925
- Miss Isringhausen?
- She's a Pinkerton.

19:04.047 --> 19:07.562
- I don't find that credible.
- That's the way they like it.

19:08.127 --> 19:12.405
Your husband's family chartered
the agency to pin his dying on you...

19:12.487 --> 19:16.275
so when you're jailed or hanged,
they can bag your gold.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.919
How do you support this contention?

19:20.007 --> 19:22.680
Oh, she's come to me.
Wants to give me money...

19:23.647 --> 19:27.606
to confirm what she says you
confessed, that you hired me to kill him.

19:31.447 --> 19:34.519
- How much have they offered?
- $50,000.

19:37.207 --> 19:40.483
And how much do you ask of me
as commission to tell the truth?

19:40.567 --> 19:42.159
I don't like the Pinkertons.

19:42.927 --> 19:46.761
They'll muscle for the bosses,
as if the bosses ain't got enough edge-

19:46.847 --> 19:49.281
So you'd side with me on principle?

19:49.927 --> 19:53.078
- Now I'll finish my fucking sentence.
- Excuse me.

19:55.287 --> 19:58.085
I don't like the Pinkertons.

19:58.527 --> 20:00.483
Being the Hearst combine
and their fucking ilk...

20:00.567 --> 20:04.082
got their eyes on taking over here,
your staying suits my purpose.

20:04.167 --> 20:07.204
As much as you can,
please minimise your obscenities.

20:08.487 --> 20:09.715
Before "ilk. "

20:11.527 --> 20:12.676
Anyways...

20:13.167 --> 20:17.718
those are my prejudices and
personal interests for siding with you.

20:18.247 --> 20:21.762
Also, if you want to match their 50...

20:23.607 --> 20:25.802
that would be
between you and your God.

20:28.367 --> 20:32.246
And what warrant would I have
against repetitions of this interview?

20:32.327 --> 20:35.444
Oh, I'd have them write
their offer out and their terms...

20:35.527 --> 20:36.801
and make them sign it.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.355
Pinkerton himself, that cocksucker,
I hate that bastard.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.482
Please.

20:42.767 --> 20:47.682
I'd make him write out their offer
with their terms and sign it...

20:47.767 --> 20:51.203
and I'd turn the document over to you,
to use as evidence against them...

20:51.287 --> 20:52.959
if they ever came against you.

20:56.207 --> 20:57.845
Let me consider.

21:03.487 --> 21:05.796
And tell that child no hard feelings.

21:09.687 --> 21:11.643
What tea do you enjoy?

21:12.647 --> 21:15.002
I like that fucking black Darjeeling. Oh.

21:24.647 --> 21:27.559
- Have we a new Pope?
- She's some fuck, E.B.

21:29.847 --> 21:32.964
I won't fuck Chinese.
I got a mother living yet.

21:33.407 --> 21:34.760
She the jealous type?

21:35.287 --> 21:37.403
You can't deny it is off-putting...

21:37.767 --> 21:40.998
how them Chinese girls' quivers
don't run quite plum.

21:41.087 --> 21:42.918
That's a fucking libel and a myth.

21:43.727 --> 21:45.638
They'll never get my dime.

21:45.727 --> 21:48.116
Another round, Tom, for the board.

21:48.647 --> 21:50.160
You're past due on three.

21:50.327 --> 21:54.286
- There are them as do fuck squaws.
- "Pathfinders," I call them.

21:54.687 --> 21:56.564
I call mine "Johnny Roger. "

21:56.647 --> 22:00.037
You ever hear, Tom,
the Chinese whore...

22:00.447 --> 22:04.360
has an ancient way of milking you
of your sorrow...

22:04.727 --> 22:09.243
your loneliness and that awful feeling
of being forsaken.

22:14.487 --> 22:16.876
Seems to me
that'd leave you with nothing.

22:23.087 --> 22:24.725
In the thoroughfare this morning...

22:24.807 --> 22:27.844
an event transpired
which cannot be repeated.

22:28.647 --> 22:32.845
As the apostle had it,
time's past for acting like infants.

22:33.247 --> 22:37.160
I assume Mr Utter was provoked,
yet for the sake of us all...

22:37.687 --> 22:41.760
the man that provoked him,
employed by who he is...

22:42.487 --> 22:44.443
cannot be fucking beaten.

22:44.727 --> 22:48.766
- What was the provocation?
- Hearst's man stepped on my foot.

22:48.927 --> 22:52.317
- Stepped on his foot.
- Well maybe, Cy, Mr Utter...

22:53.207 --> 22:55.801
would want to tell us about
a wagon drive he took last night...

22:55.887 --> 22:58.242
and who was in concealment
at the behest of that whore...

22:58.327 --> 23:02.240
used to work for you and how
the morning's shit-kicking resulted.

23:03.687 --> 23:06.155
The background of the beating
ain't the point...

23:06.847 --> 23:08.883
no more than
the incident's particulars, or...

23:09.247 --> 23:13.240
how offensive, if I knew them,
I might find the details personally.

23:13.807 --> 23:16.844
The Hearst interest
requires special treatment.

23:17.287 --> 23:19.847
Now we can face up to that like men...

23:20.087 --> 23:22.396
or get steamrolled
by the fucking alternative.

23:23.007 --> 23:24.042
Which is what?

23:24.127 --> 23:26.721
Which is them pissed off
they ain't getting treated special...

23:26.807 --> 23:29.367
replacing us that don't
with those who fucking will.

23:29.447 --> 23:33.679
Did he condescend, Deputy,
to your yelp of fucking pain?

23:33.767 --> 23:37.316
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ!

23:38.207 --> 23:40.516
I don't care what brought it on.

23:40.647 --> 23:43.525
Say it as murder, or more than one.

23:44.447 --> 23:48.599
George Hearst's chief geologist
don't get convicted of any crime...

23:48.687 --> 23:50.962
in any court convened by humans.

23:51.647 --> 23:55.606
They'll buy the judge, and if they can't,
the jury or witnesses.

23:55.807 --> 23:57.559
If not, they'll start into killing.

23:58.927 --> 24:00.326
What the fuck are we talking about?

24:02.327 --> 24:03.726
Why would we want to know?

24:05.687 --> 24:06.961
Well, Cy...

24:08.527 --> 24:11.564
all that geologist did
was step on Utter's foot.

24:12.927 --> 24:14.519
Are we fucking done here?

24:15.087 --> 24:18.204
Because if you people ain't,
I fucking am!

24:26.927 --> 24:30.317
If Hearst's geologist ain't
pursuing remedies, and Utter ain't...

24:31.447 --> 24:33.483
that leaves you speaking for the camp.

24:42.007 --> 24:43.201
Adjourned.

24:47.607 --> 24:50.565
- He wants to talk to you.
- Who?

24:51.087 --> 24:54.921
- Wolcott.
- We transacted our business.

24:55.207 --> 24:59.041
He says he has Hickok's last letter.

24:59.127 --> 25:01.561
If you see him, he'll give it to you.

25:05.327 --> 25:07.761
I hear you say
Wolcott wants to see Utter?

25:13.527 --> 25:14.846
The bald contempt of it.

25:16.007 --> 25:17.725
Why not come out five abreast?

25:17.967 --> 25:21.676
Cavorting and taunting,
"E.B. was left out. E.B. was left out. "

25:22.567 --> 25:24.922
Cocksuckers. Cuntlickers.

25:25.287 --> 25:27.596
Make your filthy gestures.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.839
Public service
was never my primary career.

25:36.207 --> 25:37.879
Two come this way.

25:38.047 --> 25:41.005
I only hope, Sheriff, us having
just come to fucking consensus...

25:41.087 --> 25:43.476
you intend no further worrying
on this matter.

25:43.567 --> 25:44.716
I don't.

25:44.807 --> 25:47.560
Or, for your own sake,
that you're coming here to fucking eat.

25:48.887 --> 25:51.481
- Gentlemen.
- Farnum.

25:51.647 --> 25:55.037
Come from the gathering
of the worthies.

25:56.967 --> 26:00.357
Whatever was purposed
by your get-together at The Gem...

26:00.447 --> 26:02.961
I hope came to full fruition.

26:03.087 --> 26:04.315
Thanks.

26:06.447 --> 26:08.005
I believe she's in.

26:09.287 --> 26:11.562
As is the child.

26:11.647 --> 26:14.115
Which may confound his intention.

26:30.127 --> 26:32.277
Mr Bullock. Please come in.

26:41.047 --> 26:43.277
I apologise for calling unannounced.

26:44.487 --> 26:47.160
You find us in only a mild disarray.

26:48.167 --> 26:51.682
Sofia has me for teacher now,
as well as guardian.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.526
How are you feeling?

27:08.287 --> 27:11.359
Well, thank you,
as I hope you are and your family.

27:11.447 --> 27:12.721
We're all very well.

27:18.407 --> 27:23.356
I feel better, lately, in the afternoons
than in the morning.

27:27.127 --> 27:29.641
You find the right time of day
to surprise me.

27:32.287 --> 27:36.360
Mr Star, with whom I met yesterday,
was not so fortunate.

27:36.647 --> 27:38.717
Was that a morning meeting?

27:38.927 --> 27:40.679
I fell ill at its conclusion...

27:40.767 --> 27:44.919
or, my falling ill
was the conclusion's cause.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.277
We discussed formation of a bank.

27:48.647 --> 27:52.925
It's an excellent idea, and Sol
would be an excellent chief officer.

27:53.007 --> 27:54.281
I'm glad of your opinion.

27:54.367 --> 27:58.246
And generous on your part,
who need not put capital at risk.

27:59.367 --> 28:00.720
- Thank you.
- And supportive of the camp...

28:00.807 --> 28:02.479
at a crucial hour of its history.

28:02.567 --> 28:03.886
Thank you very much.

28:05.447 --> 28:07.642
Would it be better for you if I left?

28:09.087 --> 28:12.284
- We seem to be conversing amiably.
- I mean the camp.

28:14.247 --> 28:16.920
Because I am unwell in the mornings?

28:17.687 --> 28:19.040
Would it be easier for you?

28:24.447 --> 28:27.883
Why would your leaving change, in any
material way, my situation?

28:27.967 --> 28:31.323
I mean,
as to your seeing me in the camp...

28:32.207 --> 28:33.799
more or less daily...

28:34.927 --> 28:36.963
would you prefer not to?

28:37.887 --> 28:41.596
Mr Bullock, if you believe...

28:42.207 --> 28:44.198
the change in my condition...

28:45.487 --> 28:48.126
and the decent concern for others...

28:48.247 --> 28:50.317
we claimed as our purpose
in separating...

28:50.407 --> 28:53.479
dictates now your leaving the camp...

28:53.567 --> 28:57.606
and uprooting your family,
I will not judge your decision.

28:58.887 --> 29:01.355
But, please, do not ask me
to make it for you.

29:03.407 --> 29:04.601
I understand.

29:06.567 --> 29:09.684
I do not wish to make things
more difficult for you.

29:13.807 --> 29:15.206
Will you stay?

29:18.167 --> 29:20.283
Will she be certain to know?

29:25.007 --> 29:26.486
It becomes you.

29:33.007 --> 29:35.316
I guess my concern is...

29:36.447 --> 29:40.804
why you would invite to come calling,
the man that nearly beat you to death.

29:41.807 --> 29:43.365
To know why he did it.

29:45.447 --> 29:48.678
Well, I can save you time with that,
Mr W.

29:49.647 --> 29:53.083
Utter was dismayed
you killed them whores.

29:53.807 --> 29:55.001
Now...

29:57.007 --> 29:58.759
instead of information...

29:59.727 --> 30:02.958
would your true goal be...

30:05.327 --> 30:07.079
further rebuke?

30:07.727 --> 30:10.560
Getting cuffed around a little more?

30:12.047 --> 30:15.244
Let me hire someone for the job,
'cause Utter's liable to kill you...

30:15.327 --> 30:17.557
- and I don't need you dead.
- Get out.

30:23.247 --> 30:26.922
You are tough to be a friend to.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.398
You make a good point.

30:32.807 --> 30:35.685
- Only, one would think as mayor that-
- I don't know, Farnum!

30:35.847 --> 30:37.599
- Well-
- I don't fucking know!

30:37.687 --> 30:41.043
By all means, then,
let's just let the matter rest.

30:43.287 --> 30:45.960
Go back. Go back!

30:54.767 --> 30:56.439
Much more fucking mobile.

30:58.367 --> 30:59.641
What's this about?

30:59.727 --> 31:03.436
I'm done at that hardware store with
their fucking harping and badgering.

31:03.527 --> 31:05.438
Who's harping? The Jew?

31:06.727 --> 31:10.117
- Are you making a fucking pun?
- I'm asking a fucking question.

31:10.847 --> 31:13.759
The Jew. And fucking Bullock also.

31:14.727 --> 31:17.480
I'm erratic with my decimals
and the like.

31:17.567 --> 31:20.320
So harping now is a hardship...

31:20.407 --> 31:23.524
on the same fucking order
of a boot on your fucking neck?

31:24.727 --> 31:28.037
Do not fucking fault them, Trixie,
for your own fucking fears...

31:28.127 --> 31:30.277
of tumbling to something new.

31:32.407 --> 31:36.320
Meaning you want me back there,
secreted and listening in.

31:36.527 --> 31:40.076
Attentive in particular
to talk of Hearst's geologist.

31:47.327 --> 31:49.283
Mind your fucking decimals.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.159
- Charlie Utter didn't happen to look in?
- No.

32:03.927 --> 32:07.522
As protective an eye as Charlie has
for that madam, Joanie Stubbs...

32:07.607 --> 32:09.802
if all her whores
didn't make it to that wagon...

32:09.887 --> 32:12.037
and that was on Wolcott's account...

32:12.847 --> 32:15.281
you could see what ensued
in the thoroughfare.

32:20.327 --> 32:21.806
I saw Mrs Garret.

32:23.047 --> 32:25.641
I support your enlisting
in her banking venture.

32:26.887 --> 32:29.685
- Good.
- She is as you thought.

32:29.807 --> 32:31.126
I thought so.

32:34.327 --> 32:37.160
- I'll take the air.
- Don't on my account.

32:38.007 --> 32:41.716
I come to apologise
for my work with the decimals...

32:42.407 --> 32:44.637
and my attitude over my errors.

32:45.207 --> 32:48.324
And since I do tend to be prickly
when in the wrong...

32:48.407 --> 32:52.764
if you on your part was to realise
Moses did the heavy lifting already...

32:53.487 --> 32:55.398
the fucking tablets and so forth.

32:58.327 --> 33:01.239
That might lighten the atmosphere, too.

33:04.447 --> 33:05.562
Sure.

33:12.007 --> 33:15.044
Guidance for me,
before you turn to your numbers?

33:16.687 --> 33:19.724
Tread lightly,
who lives in hope of pussy.

33:30.407 --> 33:33.604
- Is that a white male?
- Where?

33:34.007 --> 33:37.966
Issued from that Chinee whore-hut
and walking like a man relieved.

33:39.647 --> 33:41.797
Well, he is repositioning his Johnson.

33:41.887 --> 33:42.956
Sir!

33:43.607 --> 33:46.599
May I and my friend have a moment?

33:49.087 --> 33:52.363
We were wondering if...
If you fucked a chink.

33:53.967 --> 33:58.199
- What would that be to you?
- Well, they're under our care.

33:58.527 --> 33:59.801
We're their supervisors.

33:59.887 --> 34:04.836
Yeah. At a... decent fucking remove.

34:06.607 --> 34:07.801
Well, say I did?

34:08.927 --> 34:11.487
Well, we'd be eager to know the result.

34:11.567 --> 34:15.799
- Was it worth the fucking dime?
- You feel that they were overpriced?

34:16.567 --> 34:18.478
It was well worth the dime.

34:19.487 --> 34:22.717
There's a run on from the other side
of camp all the way down the creek.

34:22.806 --> 34:27.119
Tallest fucking Chinaman I ever seen
is keeping the line in fucking order.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.005
- Really?
- Yeah, well...

34:29.286 --> 34:32.404
a lot of fellas, you know,
outpaced by white pussy's price.

34:34.206 --> 34:38.324
- Well, thank you for your time, sir.
- Thank you for that information.

34:41.927 --> 34:43.838
Jesus Christ!

34:43.927 --> 34:47.078
You know that fucking Chinaman
he made reference to, don't you?

34:47.447 --> 34:51.326
Better suited than us
in every fucking aspect of the task.

34:51.847 --> 34:56.045
Fluent in both languages
and don't mind standing in filth.

34:57.407 --> 35:00.763
A man, as it happens a rival of mine...

35:00.847 --> 35:03.281
learning the secret
of a great man's lieutenant...

35:03.367 --> 35:05.403
would make that lieutenant his slave.

35:05.927 --> 35:08.600
My rival knows that expanding
the circle of the informed...

35:08.687 --> 35:10.723
diluting his power,
will confound his intention...

35:10.807 --> 35:14.959
so he takes precaution
to be sole sharer of his secret.

35:16.927 --> 35:18.440
And the world being the world...

35:20.727 --> 35:23.844
along comes
a half-assed knight errant...

35:24.207 --> 35:27.517
Utter, Hickok's ex-partner...

35:28.887 --> 35:31.321
to put all my rival's plans at risk.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.840
I'd seek audience with Utter,
verify my thinking.

35:35.927 --> 35:38.236
He earns his bread shipping packages.

35:38.767 --> 35:41.759
And as the dimwit nobility
that made him intercede...

35:41.847 --> 35:43.519
may now make him reticent...

35:43.967 --> 35:46.925
you, chief, will be my prop and ploy...

35:47.007 --> 35:50.238
whilst I seek to draw him out.

35:53.487 --> 35:56.126
I congratulate myself
on having kept you around.

35:56.247 --> 35:59.319
Why make a show of disposing of you,
was my fucking thinking.

36:02.767 --> 36:05.725
It's not like we need the storage space.

36:05.887 --> 36:09.675
And if there's a chance in 1,000
you people have been praying right...

36:10.287 --> 36:12.482
why get your boss's attention?

36:16.087 --> 36:20.080
Anyways, I have no plans
us parting company.

36:21.767 --> 36:23.166
As you will note...

36:23.927 --> 36:27.966
I have inscribed no address.

36:33.367 --> 36:35.597
Miss Here-She-Was-
Where's-She-Gone.

36:43.527 --> 36:44.926
What's that to you?

36:48.087 --> 36:50.726
Only I got packages could be halfway...

36:51.767 --> 36:53.678
by now to Cheyenne.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.156
What, is it fucking Tuesday already?

36:59.487 --> 37:01.364
It's fucking Thursday, Jane.

37:02.327 --> 37:05.478
So I got five days left
before I got to leave.

37:05.607 --> 37:08.917
- No.
- Oh, I see.

37:12.727 --> 37:16.686
- Well, you look your usual piece of shit.
- My, you, Jane...

37:17.767 --> 37:20.440
you look like dew on fucking roses.

37:28.127 --> 37:30.595
I woke up on the dirt...

37:31.807 --> 37:33.798
in the fucking graveyard...

37:34.207 --> 37:38.246
- questioning dusk or dawn.
- It was dusk.

37:38.327 --> 37:41.239
I know it was dusk
because it's fucking night now.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.727
Fucking bruises everywhere.

37:46.327 --> 37:47.760
Dished out by who?

37:56.247 --> 37:59.398
It's getting the upper fucking hand
on me, Charlie.

38:04.127 --> 38:08.166
- Go on upstairs and clean up.
- Right. Thank you.

38:09.887 --> 38:14.119
- Go on up. Hurry up, Christ's sakes.
- All right, Charlie. Thanks.

38:20.567 --> 38:23.445
- Evening.
- I'm fucking closed.

38:24.607 --> 38:26.040
Bankers' hours, huh?

38:31.927 --> 38:33.565
Where is it going anyway?

38:36.327 --> 38:37.646
Jesus Christ.

38:39.487 --> 38:42.718
She neglected
to inscribe the destination.

38:45.767 --> 38:46.916
Anyways...

38:48.367 --> 38:50.835
as far as this morning
in the thoroughfare...

38:50.927 --> 38:54.522
- I'd have done the same fucking thing.
- I'm done fucking talking about it.

38:54.607 --> 38:57.997
Don't care who he works for,
thinks he can get away with that.

38:58.607 --> 39:00.916
You give that cocksucker
what he fucking needed.

39:02.447 --> 39:04.438
Sick fucking bastard.

39:06.407 --> 39:09.126
I knew when I saw the wagon,
for Christ's sake.

39:12.007 --> 39:14.441
- Poor fucking girl.
- Tolliver's whore.

39:14.527 --> 39:17.519
- Never seen a girl so distraught.
- Wouldn't you be?

39:18.767 --> 39:22.077
Being a man,
you believe you've seen your equal.

39:22.207 --> 39:23.560
No, not to that.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.200
She told me, too.

39:32.087 --> 39:35.557
- She told you what?
- What she saw.

39:37.807 --> 39:39.957
She didn't see fucking nothing.

39:40.047 --> 39:42.515
No, I don't mean "see"
in the sense of seeing.

39:44.047 --> 39:45.958
Get the fuck away from me.

39:47.927 --> 39:51.522
Yeah, right.
Let me get this address put on.

39:54.127 --> 39:55.401
Evening.

39:59.607 --> 40:01.723
Every fracas ain't a victory, chief.

40:06.127 --> 40:07.196
Al.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.436
Al?

40:11.047 --> 40:13.515
- Why, Al?
- Why, E.B.?

40:13.727 --> 40:16.082
Because being present at that meeting
and made as you are...

40:16.167 --> 40:18.317
blackmail would've proved irresistible...

40:18.407 --> 40:21.444
and pursuing it
would have gotten you murdered.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.840
Thank you, then.
And am I still the mayor?

40:25.767 --> 40:28.361
For all of me, in perpetuity.

40:35.447 --> 40:38.439
- Full fucking day, eh, boss?
- They all are.

40:38.527 --> 40:40.518
Still got that package, I see.

40:40.607 --> 40:42.962
Ain't nothing gets by you, Johnny.

40:43.047 --> 40:45.083
I'm going to head up to Cheyenne
first thing in the morning.

40:45.207 --> 40:48.005
Don't think
that's the idea anymore, Dan.

40:49.647 --> 40:52.480
What happened to Tolliver illustrated...

40:52.567 --> 40:56.845
till the race is fucking finished,
never mark the fucking wager paid.

40:59.727 --> 41:03.481
Wakes up this morning, in bed
with the fucking Hearst combine...

41:03.567 --> 41:05.398
knowing he's got us by the balls.

41:06.047 --> 41:09.244
Whatever sick fucking business
that geologist has transacted...

41:09.927 --> 41:12.282
you can bet he had his wrists in it up-

41:12.367 --> 41:13.686
- Tolliver?
- Tolliver, yeah.

41:13.767 --> 41:16.076
Before, after and
in the fucking middle, too...

41:16.167 --> 41:18.840
thinking he's got the fucking edge,
which is the right fucking move.

41:18.927 --> 41:22.920
Underwriting whatever sick business
that fucking geologist was involved in...

41:23.007 --> 41:26.920
guarantees his fucking position,
but what fucking happens, Dan?

41:29.207 --> 41:31.721
Fucks himself up the ass, Tolliver?

41:31.807 --> 41:34.924
No mean feat,
yet how often we bring it off.

41:38.767 --> 41:40.883
Who impressed me at that meeting
was Bullock...

41:40.967 --> 41:44.323
that avoided putting his pet interests,
innocence, so forth, guilt...

41:44.407 --> 41:48.605
fucking who did what to fucking who,
before the needs of the fucking camp.

41:48.847 --> 41:52.601
It shows fucking progress.
It shows growing maturity...

41:53.607 --> 41:56.246
to what makes
the world's fucking tail wag.

41:58.447 --> 41:59.516
Anyway...

42:01.247 --> 42:03.124
that's why Cheyenne's cancelled.

42:04.687 --> 42:06.643
Well, I figured as much.

42:08.207 --> 42:10.198
You want to fuck me, Jack?

42:11.327 --> 42:13.761
- When haven't I?
- Would you pay?

42:16.367 --> 42:18.835
Can I double your mark
and call it a gift?

42:18.927 --> 42:22.363
- That way I keep my illusions.
- Let me borrow this beauty, Jack.

42:23.487 --> 42:27.036
- All yours, boss.
- You seem subdued.

42:28.127 --> 42:29.958
I'm good and fucked up, Cy.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.999
Not nearly as your friend, Mr Wolcott.

42:35.087 --> 42:39.365
His day was busy as his night.
Got his balls beat by Charlie Utter.

42:41.567 --> 42:45.799
Sweetheart, them that's dead is gone.

42:46.407 --> 42:48.398
We give them to God and move on.

42:49.207 --> 42:53.200
Hell, you didn't have to see them.
Fucking throats cut.

42:54.967 --> 42:57.276
You didn't clean up their gore.

42:57.367 --> 43:00.404
Don't tell me you cleaned up
anyone's gore, Cy.

43:05.047 --> 43:09.040
Your friend Maddie's problem,
young lady? Didn't want to get old.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.437
- Well, who the fuck does?
- Shut up, Cy.

43:12.527 --> 43:14.757
But them of us
with stamina and fortitude...

43:14.847 --> 43:16.599
don't go searching out some maniac...

43:16.687 --> 43:19.201
with a straight razor
to put us from our fear.

43:19.287 --> 43:20.356
Stop talking.

43:20.447 --> 43:23.996
I won't stop talking,
nor show the fucking future my neck.

43:26.367 --> 43:28.881
Nor forbid it in a fucking friend.

43:36.287 --> 43:38.755
I propose, instead, you and me,
Miss Stubbs...

43:39.767 --> 43:42.201
wrestle the fucking future to the ground.

43:42.607 --> 43:47.044
We fix your place up, get all new stuff,
open the fuck back up.

43:47.567 --> 43:49.683
Knowledge ain't general
what happened there...

43:49.767 --> 43:52.201
and those who know ain't gonna say.

43:59.927 --> 44:02.600
Grant me at least, as your friend...

44:03.527 --> 44:07.156
if we don't partner,
while that maniac is loose in camp...

44:07.247 --> 44:08.805
you'll avoid that fucking place.

44:11.407 --> 44:14.558
Move back here, Joanie,
where I can fucking protect you.

44:15.847 --> 44:16.916
No.

44:23.447 --> 44:27.201
What the fuck did you come here for,
if not to be protected?

44:28.607 --> 44:33.203
Don't be like your dead fucking friend,
afraid to face the truth.

44:35.327 --> 44:38.285
I was just looking to turn a trick.

44:45.367 --> 44:46.686
Mr Utter...

44:48.287 --> 44:51.438
you'll agree our shaking hands
would be incongruous?

44:53.567 --> 44:55.239
I come for my partner's letter...

44:55.327 --> 44:58.239
which you told Doc Cochran
you would give me.

45:00.287 --> 45:04.439
I can't guarantee it's genuine,
but it has the feel of authenticity...

45:05.167 --> 45:07.203
and it's clear
he would want her to have it.

45:10.607 --> 45:13.246
- To his wife, then.
- Agnes Lake.

45:17.807 --> 45:20.480
Prudence dictates
my requiring in return...

45:21.487 --> 45:23.762
your account
of what Miss Stubbs told you.

45:24.047 --> 45:27.084
The prudentest thing you can do
is not name that girl again...

45:27.167 --> 45:29.237
with me in the fucking room.

45:29.727 --> 45:34.164
It was she, this nameless she,
who set you upon me.

45:35.007 --> 45:38.602
"Agnes, darling, if such should be
we never meet again...

45:39.327 --> 45:44.037
"while firing my last shot, I will gently
breathe the name of my wife Agnes.

45:44.967 --> 45:47.242
"And with wishes even for my enemies...

45:47.327 --> 45:50.876
"I will make the plunge
and try to swim to the other shore.

45:52.407 --> 45:55.558
"J.B. Hickok, Wild Bill. "

45:55.647 --> 45:59.401
You keep this shit up, you're going
to earn a trip out the fucking window.

45:59.487 --> 46:03.162
I am simply asking confirmation
of what you were told, and by whom.

46:03.247 --> 46:05.920
And I'm promising I'll sooner
blow off your fucking head...

46:06.007 --> 46:08.202
and take the fucking letter
from your corpse...

46:08.287 --> 46:10.562
- than confide any fucking particulars.
- To me?

46:10.647 --> 46:14.356
To any-fucking-one,
when I give my word I wouldn't.

46:20.007 --> 46:22.646
Thank you, Mr Utter.

46:24.447 --> 46:26.597
That's what I wanted to know.

46:51.207 --> 46:52.765
Open or closed?

46:54.727 --> 46:56.285
Open, please.
