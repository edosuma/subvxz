00:57.223 --> 00:58.808
Sam:
IT'S A HUGE TIDAL WAVE!

00:58.892 --> 01:01.436
HELP!

01:02.520 --> 01:03.938
{\an8}GOING CRAZY!

01:04.022 --> 01:06.065
{\an8}I NEED WAVE ACTION!

01:06.149 --> 01:08.985
LET'S FORGET THIS
AND HIT MADTOWN.

01:09.068 --> 01:09.903
I HEAR YOU.

01:09.986 --> 01:13.823
{\an1}I JUST WANTED
ONE LITTLE WAVE.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.117
(<i> all gasping with exertion</i> )

01:16.201 --> 01:17.327
All:
HUH?

01:18.828 --> 01:21.080
(<i> hubbub from cruise boat</i> )

01:26.252 --> 01:28.505
HERE IT IS,
BABY.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.131
All:
WHOA!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.883
IT'S PERFECT!

01:31.966 --> 01:32.842
I'VE GOT JUST
ONE THING TO SAY.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.345
WHAT'S THAT, OTTO MAN?

01:35.428 --> 01:38.348
PADDLE, BABY, PADDLE!

01:38.431 --> 01:41.601
(<i> crowing with delight</i> )

01:47.607 --> 01:49.442
{\an1}AWESOME,
OTTO MAN!

01:49.526 --> 01:50.527
THAT WAVE
WAS PERFECT.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.611
I'M UP NEXT.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.030
SORRY, TWIST.

01:54.113 --> 01:57.408
I THINK THAT WAS THE FIRST
AND LAST WAVE OF THE DAY.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.660
OH, MAN, WHAT A RIP!

01:58.743 --> 02:01.704
I WANT <i> MORE.</i>

(<i> all sigh</i> )

(<i> boat whirring</i> )

02:09.211 --> 02:11.297
HEY, GUYS, I KNOW
WHERE WE CAN GET

02:11.381 --> 02:13.675
A TON OF BOAT WAVES
JUST LIKE THAT!

02:14.467 --> 02:16.177
(<i> car motors hum</i> )

02:18.680 --> 02:19.305
(<i> motorboats roar</i> )

02:22.141 --> 02:23.268
(<i> boat horn blasts</i> )

02:25.270 --> 02:28.314
JUST LOOK AT
ALL THOSE WAVES!

02:28.398 --> 02:30.859
{\an5}GEE, THERE SURE
ARE A LOT OF BOATS
OUT THERE...

02:30.942 --> 02:32.193
REALLY FAST BOATS.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.369
WHEW, WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

02:41.452 --> 02:42.245
DON'T LOOK
AT ME.

02:42.328 --> 02:42.996
{\an1}I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE WATER.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.081
{\an1}IT SMELLS
LIKE YOUR ROOM.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.708
IT DOESN'T SMELL THAT BAD.

02:46.791 --> 02:51.296
IT JUST SMELLS LIKE GARBAGE
MIXED WITH CRUD AND GASOLINE.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.505
RELAX, GUYS.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.590
SO THE WATER'S
A LITTLE DIRTY.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.593
{\an5}AT LEAST
IT'S NOT CROWDED
WITH OTHER SURFERS.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.220
{\an1}THAT'S BECAUSE
OTHER SURFERS HAVE BRAINS.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.765
FINE... SIT HERE
AND WATCH THE WAVES GO BY.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.684
I'M GOING SURFING.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.187
{\an1}(<i> reluctantly</i> ):
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.244

03:25.747 --> 03:27.290
THIS WATER'S
C-C-C-COLD!

03:27.373 --> 03:28.291
THAT'S
BECAUSE IT'S MUCH DEEPER

03:28.374 --> 03:30.793
IN THE CHANNEL
THAN ON THE BEACH.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.378
{\an1}IT FEELS
ALL SLIMY.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.338
BELIEVE ME

03:33.421 --> 03:34.464
IT WILL BE WORTH IT

03:34.547 --> 03:35.506
ONCE WE CATCH A FEW WAVES.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.217
I'M GOING TO NEED
A TETANUS BOOSTER.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.260
MAYBE TWO.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.682
INCOMING!

03:44.766 --> 03:46.309

03:55.360 --> 03:57.904
THOSE WAVES STUNK!

03:57.987 --> 04:00.239
SO, HOW COME, MR. SCIENCE?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.991
{\an5}(<i> gasping</i> ):
SMALL BOAT
MOVING FAST

04:02.075 --> 04:04.953
EQUALS SMALL WAKE
MOVING FAST?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.287
WHO AM I KIDDING?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.497
I DON'T KNOW.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.917
{\an5}SO, ALL WE NEED
IS A BIG BOAT
MOVING SLOW

04:11.000 --> 04:12.961
AND WE'RE
GOLDEN, RIGHT?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.170

ON HERE?

NON-MARITIME ACTIVITY

04:25.306 --> 04:27.809
OTHER THAN BOATING
IN THIS CHANNEL

04:27.892 --> 04:29.269
IS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.270
VACATE THIS L.Z. IMMEDIATELY.

04:31.354 --> 04:31.479
IS THAT CLEAR?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.858

WAIT...

04:35.942 --> 04:39.070

TO BE BACK ON LAND.

THAT WAS <i> NOT</i> FUN,
YOU GUYS!

04:55.128 --> 04:56.421
I'M SORRY.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.880
OH, MAN, WHAT
A RIP-OFF!

04:57.964 --> 04:59.048
LOOK AT THAT WAVE.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.218
I COULD BE RIDING IT RIGHT NOW.

05:02.301 --> 05:05.722
{\an4}HELLO, TICE JUST
LAID DOWN THE LAW,
REMEMBER?

05:05.805 --> 05:06.764
YEAH... SO...?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.766
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.393
{\an1}YOU KNOW WE
CAN'T SURF HERE.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.561
GO AHEAD.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.188
I WANT TO SURF THAT WAVE.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.037
CHECK OUT <i> THAT</i> WAVE MACHINE.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.330
LOOK AT THE WAY
THAT WAKE WAVE BREAKS.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.834
IT'S PERFECT.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.835
OH WELL,
TOO BAD.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.046
YUP, LET'S GO.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.297
{\an1}OTTO...

05:39.380 --> 05:41.257
THIS WILL BE
THE SURF SESSION

05:41.340 --> 05:43.009
TO END ALL
SURF SESSIONS.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.095
THIS WILL BE THE SURF SESSION
TO END YOUR LIFE.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.931
WILL YOU PLEASE GROW A BRAIN?

05:49.015 --> 05:51.601
YEAH, OTTO, THIS SOUNDS
LIKE ONE OF MY IDEAS.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.602
WELL, THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.271
WHENEVER YOU PADDLE OUT
IN A NEW BREAK

05:55.354 --> 05:57.398
YOU HAVE TO GET USED
TO THE WAVES, RIGHT?

05:57.482 --> 06:00.401
SO, THINK OF THIS
AS A NEW BREAK!

I'M THINKING OF A NEW BREAK.

{\an5}I GUESS THAT
LEAVES YOU AND
ME, BEST BRO.

{\an1}I DON'T KNOW,
OTTO MAN.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.375
YOU'RE KIDDING
ME, RIGHT?

06:16.459 --> 06:18.461
{\an3}RIGHT?

06:18.544 --> 06:21.506
OKAY, LET'S GO.

WE'RE TOAST!

06:44.403 --> 06:45.947
GOT TO HIDE.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.116
QUICK! GET BEHIND
THE CHANNEL MARKER.

TO GET WORSE.

IT'S ALL GOING TO BE WORTH IT.

THEY'RE JUST
CHEERING US ON.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.681
LET'S JUST GET
OVER THERE.

(<i> liner horn blasting,</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:45.107
{\an1}I THOUGHT THE WAVES CAME
IN THE BACK OF THESE THINGS.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.651
(<i> both scream</i> )

08:46.734 --> 08:48.444
OH, LET'S GO.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.114
LET'S GO BACK, OTTO MAN.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.367
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.494
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:36.742 --> 09:40.496
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT
WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.460
THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.753
THIS IS AWESOME, YEAH.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.678
WHOA, TWIST...
IT'S CLOSING OUT.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.637

10:10.318 --> 10:11.027
COME ON, SAMMY.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.903
WE'VE GOT TO GET
OVER THERE.

{\an1}OTTO, WHERE'S
TWISTER?

10:30.713 --> 10:31.672
I DON'T KNOW.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.923
HE WAS WITH ME,
THEN HE DISAPPEARED.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.760
TWISTER!

10:35.843 --> 10:37.219
THERE HE IS.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.598
(<i> yells in alarm</i> )

10:47.563 --> 10:50.816
OH, TWISTER!

(<i> all groan with effort</i> )

11:23.057 --> 11:28.396
{\an4}LET'S JUST MOTOR
BEFORE ANYONE
SEES US.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.897
I'M TIRED,
MY BOARD'S COMPLETELY BUSTED.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.317
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT IN TROUBLE
FOR ONCE.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.820
Tice:
ATTENTION!

11:37.321 --> 11:39.365
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, GRUNTS!

11:39.448 --> 11:41.283
ON THE OTHER HAND...

11:41.367 --> 11:42.493
I COULD BE WRONG.

11:42.576 --> 11:46.372

OKAY, NOW, LITTLE CUZZES

12:30.958 --> 12:33.169
HERE'S A MOVE THAT
GOT ME THE NICKNAME

12:33.252 --> 12:35.796
"THE HAWAIIAN TORPEDO"
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.219
{\an1}WHOA!

12:47.850 --> 12:50.769
{\an1}TRUE, THERE WAS A LITTLE
LESS MEAT ON TITO BACK THEN.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.032
{\an4}MAN, LOOK AT ALL
THAT DRIFTWOOD
FROM THE BIG STORM.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.370
WE SHOULD BUILD SOMETHING
REALLY INCREDIBLE WITH IT.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.455
LIKE A QUARTER-PIPE.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.873
{\an4}Reggie:
HOLD IT,
YOU GUYS.

13:10.956 --> 13:11.790
WE ALREADY HAVE
A QUARTER-PIPE.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.418
{\an5}Tito:
AND A BUNCH
OF OTHER STUFF

13:14.502 --> 13:16.212
YOU LITTLE CUZZES
NEVER FINISHED

13:16.295 --> 13:20.591
LIKE GO-CARTS, BOATS
AND THAT WEATHER SATELLITE.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.384
ALL THAT NEEDS IS
A GUIDANCE SYSTEM

13:22.468 --> 13:24.053
AND I PROMISE IT WILL WORK.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.264
YEAH, THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN DUMP
ANY MORE CRUD IN THE BACKYARD.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.682
RAYMUNDO WILL FREAK!

13:28.766 --> 13:31.393
{\an1}WE COULD BUILD
SOMETHING RIGHT HERE!

13:31.477 --> 13:32.770
YEAH!

13:32.853 --> 13:34.438

14:11.725 --> 14:13.060

14:13.143 --> 14:16.021

WE COULD GET AWAY FROM LARS.

14:16.105 --> 14:16.981
{\an3}HELLO?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.357
A HANGOUT?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.692
{\an1}THAT'S IT!

14:19.775 --> 14:22.278
HEY, THAT'S
A GREAT IDEA.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.446
YOU CAN BUILD
YOUR VERY OWN PIT.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.949
YOU WANT US TO HIDE
FROM LARS IN A HOLE?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.534
NO, LITTLE CUZ.

14:28.617 --> 14:33.789
THE PIT WAS OUR HANGOUT
IN MALIBU IN THE OLD DAYS.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.416
<i>IT WAS THIS AWESOME PALAPA</i>

14:35.499 --> 14:38.627
<i>WE BUILT TO HANG OUT IN</i>
<i>BETWEEN SURF SESSIONS.</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:41.589
<i>WE'D SURF, THEN HANG OUT</i>
<i>AND CHILL.</i>

14:41.672 --> 14:43.632
<i>THEN LATER, WE'D SURF,</i>
<i>THEN HANG OUT AND CHILL.</i>

14:43.716 --> 14:48.804
<i>ACTUALLY WE CHILLED A LOT.</i>

14:48.887 --> 14:52.683
IT WAS DEFINITELY THE COOLEST
PLACE ON THE BEACH.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.311
(<i> yawns</i> ):
I GOT TO CHILL.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.066

15:25.424 --> 15:26.300
(<i> Tito grunts</i> )

15:28.469 --> 15:32.890

IN A PALM TREE AGAIN, AH!

15:32.973 --> 15:34.933
(<i> arguing</i> )

15:37.978 --> 15:39.229
LITTLE CUZZES! LITTLE CUZZES!

15:39.313 --> 15:43.692
LITTLE CUZZES, A LITTLE HELP
OVER HERE, PLEASE!

15:44.860 --> 15:46.070
ICE-COLD COCONUT LEMONADE?

15:46.153 --> 15:49.073
ALOHA TO THAT, LITTLE BROTHER.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

16:18.602 --> 16:19.770
THIS IS AWESOME!

16:19.853 --> 16:21.188
IT'S SO NICE
AND COOL DOWN HERE.

16:21.271 --> 16:24.149
MY SPLEEN COULD DEAL WITH
FALLING FROM THAT HEIGHT AGAIN.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.861
THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA
TO LOWER THE ROOF, SAMMY.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.741
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THE TIDE WILL COME UP THIS HIGH

16:32.825 --> 16:33.784
AND FLOOD US OUT?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.078
NAH, ONLY ON A
FULL MOON, I THINK.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.580
{\an1}I DIDN'T CHECK IT,
BUT I THINK WE'RE PRETTY SAFE.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.165
HEY, WHERE'S TITO?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.209
HE'S GOING TO BE SO PROUD.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.712
{\an4}HE SAID IT WAS
TOO DANGEROUS
A WORK ENVIRONMENT.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.381
HMM, IT'S MISSING SOMETHING.

16:47.464 --> 16:47.756
All:
YEAH...

16:47.840 --> 16:50.217
{\an1}I KNOW.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.054
ALL THIS NEEDS NOW IS SOME RATTY
OLD FURNITURE AND SURF POSTERS

16:54.138 --> 16:57.808
AND A TV SO WE CAN
WATCH ALL MY VIDEOS!

16:57.891 --> 16:58.767
SOUNDS LIKE OUR LIVING ROOM.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.145
WHOA! DO YOU THINK RAYMUNDO

17:01.228 --> 17:03.772
WILL LET US MOVE YOUR
LIVING ROOM FURNITURE

17:03.856 --> 17:05.107
INTO OUR NEW HANGOUT?

17:05.190 --> 17:05.733
{\an5}NO!

17:05.190 --> 17:05.733
{\an3}NO!

17:05.190 --> 17:05.733

17:19.454 --> 17:20.414

17:32.801 --> 17:35.471
