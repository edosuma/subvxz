00:00.334 --> 00:02.586
- Previously on Underground...
- Rosalee?

00:02.628 --> 00:03.596
There's one man I know motivated

00:03.628 --> 00:04.696
to pluck the petals

00:04.729 --> 00:06.164
off the Black Rose.

00:06.197 --> 00:08.334
Who among you is feeling bricky tonight?

00:08.366 --> 00:09.667
I seen you.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.336
You're still the snake of a slave driver

00:11.369 --> 00:13.366
you was when you left Macon.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.518
Those who make peace
impossible make violence inevitable!

00:19.877 --> 00:20.912
You got chillun?

00:20.946 --> 00:22.615
They were the best thing in my life.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.182
Little girl ran away.

00:24.215 --> 00:25.450
Just kill yourself.

00:25.484 --> 00:28.653
Go, go! Come on. We got you.

00:41.299 --> 00:43.135
I hear this is the best
traveling minstrel.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.638
Already sold out for the entire run.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.238
Have you heard anything
about the patron, Mr. Powell?

00:58.250 --> 00:59.518
What is this?

01:02.153 --> 01:04.489
Why, hello!

01:04.522 --> 01:06.592
I'm Master White.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.894
And I've been growin' cotton
on this land

01:08.926 --> 01:11.239
since my granpappy blew on the hornpipe

01:11.273 --> 01:13.390
for good old King George.

01:20.271 --> 01:23.908
Oh, come here, you pretty little number.

01:23.941 --> 01:25.577
The good Lord's Bible

01:25.610 --> 01:28.947
tells me I must lay down
with the lamb...

01:39.658 --> 01:41.394
Good evening.

01:44.161 --> 01:47.049
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

01:47.899 --> 01:51.670
My name is Chester Whittingham,
of Philadelphia's Whittinghams.

01:51.703 --> 01:55.841
Welcome to the city of brotherly love.

01:55.873 --> 01:57.531
Did he just...?

01:57.564 --> 02:00.378
Now, our good founder William Penn

02:00.411 --> 02:03.681
bent over at least three rivers

02:03.715 --> 02:06.452
to get this premium plot of land.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.988
Now, he set out to be a holy experiment.

02:11.021 --> 02:13.158
And Lord, did he experiment

02:13.190 --> 02:16.128
with every hole he could find.

02:16.160 --> 02:19.336
Where do you think that crack
in the Liberty Bell came from?

02:45.891 --> 02:47.493
Dear Mr. Still.

02:47.525 --> 02:49.094
I apologize for my lapse

02:49.126 --> 02:50.828
in our correspondence as of late.

02:50.862 --> 02:53.198
But your letters have been
of great comfort.

02:53.231 --> 02:55.067
Particularly as I stand on the precipice

02:55.100 --> 02:57.336
of tremendous uncertainty.

02:57.368 --> 02:59.705
It's hard to untether how much
I care about the cause

02:59.737 --> 03:01.939
with how far I am willing to go for it.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.742
While I admire Georgia's

03:03.774 --> 03:06.030
resilient efforts towards peace,

03:06.062 --> 03:07.497
the fervor and forthrightness

03:07.529 --> 03:09.748
of John Brown's followers
is hard to deny.

03:13.451 --> 03:15.887
It speaks to the anger
that has consumed me

03:15.921 --> 03:17.756
since John's death.

03:17.789 --> 03:18.867
Georgia Goodwin.

03:18.892 --> 03:20.458
We know she's in here.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.961
Go around to the back door.

03:22.993 --> 03:25.430
Where is Georgia Goodwin?

03:25.463 --> 03:27.031
Valentine, what's happening?

03:27.065 --> 03:28.300
It's the police; they're coming up.

03:28.332 --> 03:29.401
Come on.

03:30.969 --> 03:32.604
Get in.

03:32.636 --> 03:35.072
Rosalee.

03:35.106 --> 03:36.207
Everybody out of your rooms, downstairs.

03:36.241 --> 03:37.642
If you got your papers on you,
we need to see 'em.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.777
Are you Georgia Goodwin?

03:38.809 --> 03:40.711
You have no right barging in here.

03:40.744 --> 03:41.813
Shut your mouth.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.846
Get down here.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.615
Move.

04:19.317 --> 04:20.486
You all right?

04:20.519 --> 04:22.321
- Is this your wife?
- No.

04:22.354 --> 04:24.991
She fit the description
but she says she ain't her.

04:25.023 --> 04:27.453
I got a warrant here with
Georgia Goodwin's name on it.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.500
- Where is she?
- What is the warrant for?

04:29.533 --> 04:30.986
Fraud, state of Virginia.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.822
Harboring a fugitive of the law,

04:32.854 --> 04:34.056
that's what y'all are doing.

04:34.089 --> 04:35.491
Keep it up.

04:35.524 --> 04:37.626
And I guarantee all of you
a trip across the river

04:37.659 --> 04:39.595
to my jail, but what I can't guarantee

04:39.628 --> 04:41.297
is that y'all will make it back.

04:41.330 --> 04:42.798
Nobody's leaving here without a fight.

04:43.966 --> 04:45.802
Is that right?

04:45.834 --> 04:48.021
Don't do anything stupid now.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.999
Stop.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.403
I'm Georgia Goodwin.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.639
Get on it then.

04:58.313 --> 04:59.849
In my desk, there's a black envelope.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.184
Bring it to the jailhouse.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.986
Just you.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.969
Free papers.

05:27.142 --> 05:28.477
Who bring unu this shame?

05:28.510 --> 05:29.611
Speak, girl.

05:29.645 --> 05:31.046
Who give unu the devil blood?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.216
The ancestors bring unu back from dead.

05:33.248 --> 05:35.684
They want unu speak.
Who poisoning we people?

05:35.717 --> 05:39.188
See? That poison ain't save unu.

05:39.221 --> 05:40.957
It's got you shaking and sweating.

05:40.989 --> 05:43.535
All of we save unu from that water.

05:44.058 --> 05:46.328
You ain't got no family but we.

05:47.456 --> 05:48.731
Unu can speak to we.

05:49.499 --> 05:50.633
Embrace we.

05:50.666 --> 05:52.711
Then we can embrace her.

06:03.712 --> 06:06.475
This ain't about me speaking.

06:08.143 --> 06:10.686
Y'all don't really want that.

06:10.719 --> 06:12.488
'Cause then half of y'all standin' here

06:12.522 --> 06:14.391
would have to admit
to takin' the devil's blood.

06:16.092 --> 06:18.928
This ain't even about what I done.

06:19.237 --> 06:21.864
It's about shamin' others
so they don't do anything

06:21.897 --> 06:23.325
you don't want them to.

06:24.366 --> 06:26.068
This here ain't family.

06:38.613 --> 06:41.784
I wish I talked when
they been to shame me.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.055
Sometimes it be harder to
stand up to those you close to.

06:45.755 --> 06:48.758
All them, even me father,

06:48.791 --> 06:52.529
want you for just smile
pretty, be innocent.

06:52.561 --> 06:54.062
Don't care what ya done,

06:54.096 --> 06:56.566
long as everything seem okay.

06:56.933 --> 06:59.569
Sometimes I want to hurt myself.

07:00.969 --> 07:02.438
Not like what ya done.

07:02.471 --> 07:05.375
Just maybe... slashin' my face.

07:05.407 --> 07:08.777
Force everyone to look at
how it feel on the inside.

07:08.810 --> 07:11.456
That's the worst kind of control.

07:12.113 --> 07:15.084
Destroying yourself 'fore they can.

07:19.654 --> 07:22.926
They go on talk about why
you try for drown yourself.

07:24.928 --> 07:27.096
One say you was laying

07:27.128 --> 07:28.897
with the massa where you come from.

07:28.931 --> 07:31.166
Say that why the mistress sent you away.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.669
She jealous.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.271
It true?

07:35.104 --> 07:36.815
Mostly.

07:37.507 --> 07:39.526
But it ain't the why.

07:44.447 --> 07:46.749
I want you teach me.

07:46.782 --> 07:49.818
I want you teach me how for
get massa for do what I want.

07:50.662 --> 07:52.421
Why?

07:52.455 --> 07:54.207
What Hicks done to me,

07:54.789 --> 07:57.326
I ain't got no power to stop it.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.964
And I want some.

08:11.339 --> 08:14.676
No one threw
anything at the stage today.

08:14.709 --> 08:17.212
I say that's cause for celebration.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.773
Join us, Mr. Powell?

08:19.481 --> 08:20.849
I've got other business,

08:20.883 --> 08:23.385
but chase the bottom of a bottle on me.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.354
Ah.

08:33.662 --> 08:35.532
I went looking for you backstage.

08:35.565 --> 08:37.657
Should have known you'd be out
here front and center.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.202
Is everything in order for tonight?

08:41.269 --> 08:42.615
And our out-of-town guests?

08:42.649 --> 08:44.318
Settling into
the hotel suites you provided.

08:44.351 --> 08:45.264
The food.

08:45.289 --> 08:46.509
The chefs are skinning
all manner of beasts

08:46.541 --> 08:48.043
to feast on as we speak.

08:48.076 --> 08:50.012
- And the balloons.
- Arrived this morning.

08:50.046 --> 08:51.247
They've overtaken the parlor.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.549
It's hard to believe

08:52.581 --> 08:54.349
there's just air
in those things, isn't it?

08:54.383 --> 08:55.652
Especially considering how much it costs

08:55.685 --> 08:57.152
to ship them all the way from London.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.547
It doesn't sound like

08:59.580 --> 09:00.989
you're ready for a party, Francis.

09:01.022 --> 09:04.159
A party is you, me and Devi
on a rainy night in Mayfair.

09:04.192 --> 09:05.928
Your grand entry

09:05.961 --> 09:08.363
into Philadelphian society
tonight's spectacle,

09:08.397 --> 09:10.499
just like this show.

09:10.532 --> 09:11.868
How long do you think you can
keep this going on?

09:11.901 --> 09:13.703
- Money's of no concern.
- Then what is?

09:13.735 --> 09:14.937
Winning.

09:14.970 --> 09:17.606
I saw you winning... with Devi.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.408
What are you doing here?

09:19.441 --> 09:21.577
Calling all this attention to yourself.

09:21.610 --> 09:23.845
We're not in London, anymore.
You're poking a bear.

09:23.878 --> 09:26.007
I'm putting the bear down.

09:31.554 --> 09:34.290
We're gonna be late for our
appointment with the tailor.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.935
I don't need another new suit.

09:37.826 --> 09:40.529
I'm not gonna be
in attendance for this one.

09:40.562 --> 09:42.464
And why is that?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.569
'Cause I feel like I'm watching a man

09:46.602 --> 09:49.531
carefully tie his own goddamn noose.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.808
And I haven't been
in America long enough

09:51.840 --> 09:53.660
to want to watch you hang.

10:00.416 --> 10:01.960
Georgia.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.720
Are you okay?

10:04.753 --> 10:06.055
We need to move the cargo.

10:06.088 --> 10:07.457
What, they suspect we're a station?

10:07.489 --> 10:08.825
But the sheriff said "fraud."

10:08.858 --> 10:10.126
The arrest was due to a family matter.

10:10.158 --> 10:11.426
- I will handle it.
- Georgia.

10:11.459 --> 10:12.795
We don't have time to waste.

10:12.828 --> 10:14.497
I saw your papers.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.964
You've been passing.

10:15.998 --> 10:17.934
If you tell me what's going on,

10:17.966 --> 10:20.068
maybe I can help you.

10:20.562 --> 10:22.572
It's none of your business.

10:22.604 --> 10:24.482
Hey, nigger.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.776
You ain't fooling nobody.

10:27.276 --> 10:28.678
We're watching you.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.580
- How dare you?
- Elizabeth, don't.

10:30.613 --> 10:32.915
Let's just go inside.

10:32.948 --> 10:34.517
Run and hide.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.553
We'll be waiting.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.306
What happened to you?

11:10.996 --> 11:14.266
You used to be the best tracker
south of the Ohio.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.568
Now it looks like you
couldn't find your dignity

11:16.600 --> 11:18.469
if I drew you a map.

11:18.503 --> 11:21.003
Yet here I sit on a bucket of shit

11:21.036 --> 11:22.999
with a proposition for you.

11:29.347 --> 11:30.749
As irony has it...

11:30.781 --> 11:32.216
I think it's irony, anyway...

11:32.249 --> 11:33.719
I have a need to track down

11:33.752 --> 11:35.053
your white whale.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.788
Negro girl named Rosalee.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.156
Mulatto, well-made.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.849
I know who she is.

11:52.771 --> 11:54.948
All you got to do to get
your freedom back...

11:56.307 --> 11:58.176
is take hers away.

12:11.156 --> 12:14.026
Give him a bath before you
put him on one of my horses.

13:04.309 --> 13:06.210
Why didn't you tell us?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.173
What would you have said if I had?

13:08.207 --> 13:11.516
I would have told you
that what you're doing is crazy.

13:11.549 --> 13:12.718
Mm-hmm. And you
would've tried to stop me.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.152
- Going on runs with Harriet...
- I need to learn

13:14.185 --> 13:15.654
- how to steal my family back.
- ...putting yourself

13:15.686 --> 13:17.255
and the baby in danger.

13:17.288 --> 13:18.522
I was being careful.

13:18.556 --> 13:19.490
Careful?

13:20.617 --> 13:22.911
Rosalee, look at yourself.

13:24.579 --> 13:26.097
You almost died.

13:27.957 --> 13:29.401
What were you thinking?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.971
I was thinking about this baby.

13:34.839 --> 13:37.608
When I realized I was even carryin',

13:37.642 --> 13:39.777
I was already on the road with Moses,

13:39.810 --> 13:41.546
learnin' so much.

13:41.930 --> 13:44.282
This didn't even seem real.

13:44.315 --> 13:46.768
It was still just me.

13:47.685 --> 13:51.290
Everybody
and everything I called home...

13:51.648 --> 13:52.925
gone.

13:53.483 --> 13:57.094
And I knew if I could learn
a little more from Moses,

13:57.128 --> 13:59.405
maybe I could have it all back.

14:01.232 --> 14:04.160
Then my belly started to grow, and...

14:05.119 --> 14:06.955
it got very real.

14:08.623 --> 14:10.667
Every time I saw myself...

14:11.408 --> 14:13.544
holdin' this baby,

14:15.463 --> 14:17.382
Noah's baby,

14:19.258 --> 14:21.552
he was right there with me.

14:22.345 --> 14:25.056
My mama was right there with me.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.850
I need 'em, not just for me...

14:28.459 --> 14:29.828
for both of us.

14:33.764 --> 14:35.817
I feel so scared.

14:38.695 --> 14:40.613
I can't do it alone.

14:44.108 --> 14:46.744
Rosalee, listen to me.

14:46.777 --> 14:49.781
You are not alone.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.821
But if you kill this baby trying
to get the rest of them back,

14:56.854 --> 14:58.381
you will be.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.368
Mama taught me how to make this

15:10.402 --> 15:12.705
'fore she cross over on home
to the ancestors.

15:15.746 --> 15:17.808
I can't believe you ain't
never had bread pudding.

15:17.841 --> 15:19.377
Don't matter what I ain't had.

15:19.411 --> 15:21.380
It's about what the massa ain't.

15:21.412 --> 15:24.983
You ain't like the girls
he used to, and that's good.

15:25.408 --> 15:26.718
But I ain't like you.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.553
They don't like dark skin.

15:28.585 --> 15:30.187
How you think I got here?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.059
You want me to get you some water?

15:34.091 --> 15:35.126
I'm fine.

15:37.879 --> 15:38.997
Come on,

15:39.030 --> 15:40.999
let me fix your hair.

15:41.424 --> 15:42.834
What's wrong with it?

15:42.867 --> 15:44.902
The hardest part ain't got nothin' to do

15:44.935 --> 15:46.570
with the way you look.

15:46.604 --> 15:49.507
You got more than enough
to get somebody into your bed,

15:49.932 --> 15:51.343
but you got to keep 'em there.

15:51.642 --> 15:52.911
How I do that?

15:53.352 --> 15:55.347
All men feel like nobody listen to them.

15:55.379 --> 15:57.214
- That's where you start.
- Ooh, but what about...

15:57.248 --> 15:59.651
Shut your mouth and listen.

16:00.109 --> 16:02.654
That's how you find out what he love.

16:02.686 --> 16:05.156
Then you let him teach you 'bout it.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.758
Men like to feel
like they showin' you things

16:07.791 --> 16:09.702
ain't nobody else has.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.998
I just pretend I like whatever he like.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.000
No.

16:15.032 --> 16:18.878
You got to find something real
in the lie.

16:20.129 --> 16:24.008
It's only believable
if there's a part of you in it.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.212
You teach your daughter this here?

16:28.312 --> 16:29.639
Nah.

16:30.807 --> 16:33.218
I taught her to keep her head down.

16:33.251 --> 16:35.120
I did it so she wouldn't have to.

16:35.770 --> 16:37.723
And what happened to her?

16:40.775 --> 16:42.294
She ran away.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.310
I have to say,

16:58.543 --> 17:02.147
you haven't left behind much
of a paper trail, Mr. Pullman.

17:02.180 --> 17:06.317
My man in Georgia is usually
pretty good at background work,

17:06.351 --> 17:08.652
but he found next to nothing on you.

17:08.685 --> 17:10.387
Your father, on the other hand...

17:10.421 --> 17:12.055
there was a bit more on him,

17:12.306 --> 17:14.992
his being military and all.

17:15.476 --> 17:18.063
Dishonorable discharge
from the Georgia Militia.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.098
Did he not agree with President Jackson?

17:21.357 --> 17:23.300
I ain't one much for history.

17:23.693 --> 17:25.137
Yet here you are

17:25.170 --> 17:27.672
hunting an old bounty.

17:33.953 --> 17:34.813
Huh.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.453
What are you writin'?

17:43.754 --> 17:45.190
I'm told you have a son.

17:50.961 --> 17:53.931
I can clean up the rest, thank you.

17:56.167 --> 17:57.402
Mmm.

17:59.671 --> 18:03.040
I know you're thinkin'
about that bottle.

18:03.074 --> 18:05.153
When you're gonna get some.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.144
That's good. That's what I want.

18:07.178 --> 18:09.714
A man who wants. A man who needs.

18:09.747 --> 18:11.449
A man who acts.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.118
If I am going to cut a dog loose,

18:14.152 --> 18:15.353
especially where we're going,

18:15.385 --> 18:18.489
I am going to want a dog that can bite.

18:19.248 --> 18:21.994
You can still bite, can't you?

18:30.067 --> 18:32.469
I can write a letter, if you want.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.672
To your son.

18:48.444 --> 18:49.520
We'll ride out with the wagons

18:49.554 --> 18:51.056
in both directions.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.323
If anyone's still watching the house,

18:52.356 --> 18:53.757
that should draw them away.

18:53.790 --> 18:55.392
You wait 20 minutes,

18:55.425 --> 18:56.827
then move through the tunnel
with the men.

18:56.861 --> 18:59.030
Thad and Elliot, take one wagon.

18:59.063 --> 19:00.131
You head east.

19:00.164 --> 19:01.766
Elizabeth and I will go west.

19:01.798 --> 19:03.434
Just like always,

19:03.834 --> 19:05.604
you ride like there's nothin' to hide.

19:07.738 --> 19:09.106
You're going with them?

19:09.732 --> 19:11.376
Two to a wagon makes more sense.

19:11.409 --> 19:14.012
And they have no idea
what they're riding into.

19:14.045 --> 19:15.913
You didn't tell them.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.785
It's not my secret to tell.

19:21.435 --> 19:24.221
They know the risks of moving cargo.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.891
Today's revelations don't change that.

19:26.923 --> 19:30.027
Maybe you're right.
Maybe nothing happens tonight.

19:30.319 --> 19:32.029
But it's reckless.

19:32.596 --> 19:34.798
You're risking their lives
to keep your secret.

19:35.157 --> 19:37.802
It might make things easier on
you, but it's not fair to them.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.036
Is that what you think?

19:40.204 --> 19:42.373
That I do this because it's easier?

19:43.624 --> 19:46.044
I don't know what to think.

19:46.502 --> 19:48.579
You won't talk to me.

19:52.008 --> 19:54.343
What was your mother's favorite color?

19:55.720 --> 19:56.820
Blue.

19:56.854 --> 20:00.825
You would be surprised how many
times, in passing conversation,

20:00.857 --> 20:03.602
someone asks you a detail
about your mother.

20:04.094 --> 20:07.065
I made the details up
so that I wouldn't slip.

20:07.097 --> 20:09.267
Where she was educated.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.502
The length of her hair.

20:11.736 --> 20:13.904
Her favorite pianoforte.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.825
And those details eventually
amount to a person.

20:19.535 --> 20:21.746
And when I close my eyes at night

20:21.778 --> 20:24.123
and I try to remember my real mother,

20:25.374 --> 20:26.985
it gets harder.

20:27.335 --> 20:28.753
Every time.

20:29.712 --> 20:31.756
And I'm terrified
that one of these nights

20:31.788 --> 20:33.691
I'm going to close my
eyes and see nothing.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.471
The minute that these men
took up the cause,

20:38.971 --> 20:41.666
the minute that they called
themselves abolitionist,

20:41.699 --> 20:43.893
they put a target on their back.

20:45.353 --> 20:47.980
I've lived with one most of my life.

20:50.316 --> 20:53.027
There's nothing easy about this secret.

20:55.479 --> 20:56.530
Miss Georgia?

20:56.967 --> 20:59.551
There's a man at the front door
asking for you.

20:59.584 --> 21:01.535
Are you expecting any more visitors?

22:45.397 --> 22:46.866
Friends of the enslaved,

22:46.898 --> 22:48.234
friends of the cause,

22:48.266 --> 22:49.902
I welcome you to my home.

22:50.394 --> 22:51.838
I imagine my sudden appearance

22:51.876 --> 22:53.421
in your great city

22:53.447 --> 22:55.357
raises a lot of questions.

22:55.839 --> 22:58.443
In less polite crowds, the
question I can always count on

22:58.476 --> 23:00.879
pertains to my face, this scar.

23:01.447 --> 23:04.825
A reminder of my own time in bondage.

23:08.368 --> 23:12.392
I wish I had some dramatic tale
of revolution and defiance

23:12.425 --> 23:14.726
to explain it, but...

23:14.753 --> 23:16.746
truth be told, I got this

23:16.778 --> 23:19.765
because my master was a crap shot.

23:20.507 --> 23:22.435
He and a friend were going on
about this story.

23:22.467 --> 23:25.370
A fellow puts a-an apple
on his son's head.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.606
Shot it clean off.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.789
Soon enough, my massa put $100

23:29.821 --> 23:32.544
against his knocking
a McIntosh off of my head.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.747
He got close.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.916
Trust me, he got close.

23:36.948 --> 23:40.986
But that $100 he lost

23:41.020 --> 23:43.122
got me taken to the forge.

23:43.155 --> 23:48.328
And them embers reminded
a nigger like me

23:48.360 --> 23:50.729
what happens when you take money

23:50.763 --> 23:53.123
out of the pocket of a white man.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.168
What I've learned
on my journey to freedom

23:56.460 --> 23:59.005
is there is nothing in your past

23:59.038 --> 24:01.474
you cannot forge into a weapon.

24:01.506 --> 24:04.776
What I got right here was
a lesson in how to hurt them.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.479
It's all about the money.

24:06.512 --> 24:09.415
They ain't nearly so much cruel
as they are greedy.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.351
They are slaves to capitalism.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.358
That's why I offered my home
to Mr. Still.

24:18.899 --> 24:20.325
My story

24:20.359 --> 24:21.527
to you.

24:22.446 --> 24:25.465
But most importantly...

24:25.497 --> 24:28.767
...my money to the cause.

24:36.007 --> 24:38.294
This is our weapon.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.715
This is how we hurt them.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.991
I was playing a role.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.993
Wore white powder... three layers.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.195
Rode the train all the way to Canada

24:56.227 --> 24:58.196
as Harriet's massa.
Ain't nobody stop us.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.057
She said to me,

25:00.582 --> 25:02.534
"Act like you own the world,

25:02.568 --> 25:04.704
and that's exactly
how they gonna treat you."

25:04.736 --> 25:06.705
Hmm.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.165
I'm sorry.

25:11.199 --> 25:13.954
I've... been talkin' this whole time.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.050
Come on now. Tell me.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.834
What happened to you?

25:20.002 --> 25:21.420
Who took you?

25:24.723 --> 25:27.225
Oh, it don't matter. I'm here now.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.562
Just want to put all that behind me.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.267
There's something I got to tell you.

25:39.063 --> 25:40.572
Noah...

25:42.073 --> 25:43.901
I, um...

25:47.029 --> 25:48.655
What?

25:52.885 --> 25:55.754
I'm going back to get Momma and James.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.292
Back-back... back to Macon?

26:03.921 --> 26:05.131
But you hurt.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.234
I'm healin'. Gonna be fine soon.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.102
And it ain't gonna be
like when we ran the last time.

26:10.136 --> 26:13.272
I know all the routes, all
the safe houses and stations.

26:13.304 --> 26:15.599
We gonna have help
every step of the way.

26:16.474 --> 26:19.111
I made a plan with Harriet.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.814
Save up every little bit
they give me at that hospital.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.648
Bought two train tickets to Atlanta.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.618
Same one we put Boo on.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.786
It can take us there the whole way.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.224
With... with-with me playing your slave?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.075
Just like I did with Harriet.

26:34.118 --> 26:35.895
Train leave in five days.

26:36.453 --> 26:38.130
You aimin' for Christmas?

26:39.039 --> 26:40.923
You steal 'em Christmas night,

26:41.391 --> 26:43.602
be three more days
'fore work start up again.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.605
We be in a safe house Carolina way

26:45.638 --> 26:47.139
by the time they even notice we gone.

26:51.802 --> 26:53.512
Oh, Rose, that...

26:53.846 --> 26:55.848
sounds like a good plan.

26:57.641 --> 27:00.253
But ain't nothin' ever go as planned.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.187
I know.

27:02.820 --> 27:06.492
And I know... I don't
seem like much now, but...

27:06.524 --> 27:08.360
Noah, I'm strong.

27:09.111 --> 27:10.128
You found your way

27:10.161 --> 27:11.905
back to me just in time.

27:12.656 --> 27:14.800
Noah, I know together
we can do anything.

27:22.416 --> 27:24.676
Oh, I hate animals.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.278
Especially horses.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.780
Why can't he just be
like the other buckra

27:27.812 --> 27:29.215
and stay up in the big house?

27:29.247 --> 27:31.850
I'll do all the talkin'.
You just listen.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.120
Take this.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.222
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

27:36.254 --> 27:37.689
- Maybe we should come back another time.
- No.

27:37.723 --> 27:40.225
That's just what we need.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.628
Stop it, boy. Hey, go on, get.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.730
Sorry, master. Sorry.
Didn't mean to disturb.

27:45.763 --> 27:47.867
Dog probably just smelled the food.

27:47.899 --> 27:50.136
- What are y'all doing 'round here?
- I wanted to say

27:50.168 --> 27:51.803
sorry for how I was the other day.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.506
You could have had me
punished, but you didn't.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.342
Miss Clara here was kind enough

27:56.375 --> 27:58.678
to help me make something
sweet to thank you.

28:01.038 --> 28:02.514
What is it?

28:02.548 --> 28:04.082
It's called bread pudding.

28:09.265 --> 28:10.609
You like horses?

28:13.233 --> 28:15.527
I ain't never seen one
as pretty as that.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.330
Her name is Temple.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.863
She's a war horse.

28:19.598 --> 28:20.832
What's that?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.702
Horses have been one
of man's greatest assets

28:22.734 --> 28:24.736
in warfare for centuries.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.571
Temple's breed was used
for cavalry charges

28:26.605 --> 28:28.341
during the Revolution.

28:29.149 --> 28:30.176
She's strong.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.253
Been with me most of my life.

28:34.196 --> 28:38.083
But you know, her coat
wasn't always so white.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.519
What color was it?

28:40.551 --> 28:43.089
When she first came to me, it was gray.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.390
But as she's gotten older...

28:45.424 --> 28:48.261
...her coat has turned silver,
then white.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.095
You know, most gray horses

28:50.128 --> 28:52.564
start off black with dark eyes.

28:53.215 --> 28:54.399
Both fade over time.

28:54.758 --> 28:55.968
Want to pet her?

28:57.302 --> 28:58.404
Oh, I couldn't.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.173
Go ahead. She's friendly.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.880
Don't laugh at me, huh?

29:07.913 --> 29:09.147
Me can't stand being laughed at.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.192
I'm sorry. She was just saying hi.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.621
You don't have to be scared. Here.

29:32.646 --> 29:33.806
See?

29:34.798 --> 29:36.758
She just has to get used to you.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.137
We need to be getting
back to the quarters.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.654
Did I do somethin' wrong?

29:48.686 --> 29:50.981
You got to leave him wantin' more.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.124
Don't look back.

29:53.157 --> 29:54.443
He watchin'.

29:55.226 --> 29:59.130
You gonna come back for that
basket a little after super.

29:59.164 --> 30:02.075
After he done had
his after-dinner whiskey.

30:02.993 --> 30:05.170
That's when you stay a little longer.

30:23.305 --> 30:25.023
How is she doing?

30:26.642 --> 30:27.994
Restin' now.

30:30.312 --> 30:32.497
I was real sorry to hear about John.

30:34.858 --> 30:36.985
I appreciate y'all takin' care of her.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.324
I'm glad you're back.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.129
She needs you.

30:45.161 --> 30:46.544
No, she done all right.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.415
All them people she helped
to freedom... it's amazing.

30:50.499 --> 30:52.016
Last time

30:52.050 --> 30:53.753
we saw each other,
we was runnin' from danger,

30:53.785 --> 30:55.120
now she runnin' into it.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.992
She told you about the plan
to rescue her family.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.394
She want me to go with her.

31:03.512 --> 31:05.664
Be back in Georgia by Christmas.

31:06.682 --> 31:08.234
I know.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.101
Going back right now to the hell

31:10.135 --> 31:12.872
we ran so hard to get away
from... that seems crazy,

31:12.905 --> 31:14.606
with her hurt like that.

31:15.076 --> 31:18.110
She won't go if you don't go.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.695
No, she need 'em.

31:20.244 --> 31:22.614
She need 'em. Her momma, her brother.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.096
I ain't never had no family, but

31:25.867 --> 31:28.686
I'm-I'm startin'
to understand the pull of it.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.541
And I know it ain't so easy for
her to just start over, but...

31:34.084 --> 31:37.195
goin' back to Macon... that'd be
the last thing I want to do.

31:37.587 --> 31:39.397
And that's how I been livin' my life,

31:39.430 --> 31:41.199
always at the point of just

31:41.233 --> 31:43.402
doin' the last thing I want to do.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.904
I ain't never had no choice.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.272
And now that I got one, I...

31:46.304 --> 31:47.806
Then tell her that.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.474
Be honest with her.

31:50.434 --> 31:52.644
She will hear you.

31:53.177 --> 31:56.606
If you don't go, she can't go.

31:58.082 --> 32:01.049
Mr. Powell, I'd like to introduce you
to Frederick Douglass.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.088
Your first autobiography was remarkable.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.322
I haven't had a chance
to crack the second,

32:04.356 --> 32:05.758
but I'm sure it will not disappoint.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.426
I hear you've just returned from abroad.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.893
- England.
- Oh, I spent

32:08.926 --> 32:10.350
some time in the Kensington area.

32:10.384 --> 32:12.765
It's not my place of birth,
but I was reborn there.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.800
To be treated not as colored,
but as a man.

32:14.832 --> 32:17.101
One hopes we can achieve
such here in America.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.605
Tonight will certainly help us
get closer to that goal.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.507
We have exceeded our largest
intake by a country mile.

32:22.716 --> 32:24.909
Well, if it's one thing I've
learned from your print,

32:24.943 --> 32:26.512
it's that the success
of the abolitionist

32:26.544 --> 32:28.869
movement hinges
on Northern public support.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.282
And from you, sir,

32:30.314 --> 32:32.250
nothing inspires said support more

32:32.283 --> 32:33.985
than the heroism of the runaway.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.021
I do have my concerns
that we're often too public

32:36.053 --> 32:37.522
when we speak of our secret network.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.257
There is a balance
that needs to be found.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.760
But tales of successful flight
can inspire those

32:41.792 --> 32:43.361
yet in bondage to action.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.153
While also cutting off
their routes to freedom.

32:45.186 --> 32:46.365
It's why I kept

32:46.397 --> 32:48.801
the exact details
of my own escape out of my book.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.301
We cannot overexpose it.

32:50.334 --> 32:52.103
Says the most photographed
man in the world.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.706
Touché.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.141
But image is important.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.877
A single photo can do more to alter

32:57.909 --> 32:59.344
the perception of the race

32:59.378 --> 33:01.547
than any vile words shouted in hatred.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.849
Men like you need to be seen
and heard as much as possible.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.850
Talking is great,
but I'm one for action.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.786
Revolution,
like that cracker from Kansas.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.855
- John Brown.
- Mm, there is some distance

33:09.888 --> 33:11.689
between us and Mr. Brown's methods.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.292
But we do all agree
that war is inevitable.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.161
The world is getting hotter.

33:16.194 --> 33:18.731
I think that means that
emancipation is on the horizon.

33:18.763 --> 33:21.199
I spent years out in the field
looking out at the horizon.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.692
Here's the thing about it.

33:23.534 --> 33:25.970
You can't ever quite get to it, can you?

33:26.003 --> 33:28.373
We need to put him in
a room with Harriet.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.310
Did I tell you I've finally
convinced her to speak?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.745
Oh. The Earth might stop turning.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.436
This party was an exclusive invitation.

33:49.468 --> 33:50.804
Well, then, perhaps
you should check the list again.

33:50.836 --> 33:52.605
The last name is "Cannon."

33:53.073 --> 33:56.142
We've never met, but it seems
we've both heard of each other.

33:56.176 --> 33:59.780
"Negro man named Cato,
copper-toned, fanciful dress.

33:59.813 --> 34:02.607
Horribly burned
on the right side of the face."

34:03.383 --> 34:05.819
Although you do look a little
taller than five-foot-eight.

34:05.851 --> 34:07.987
Massa Tom saw what he wanted
to see, now didn't he?

34:08.021 --> 34:10.389
Only thing worse than
his sense of measurement

34:10.422 --> 34:13.118
was his judgment in choosing a catcher.

34:13.994 --> 34:15.362
Last I heard,
they were stretching you out

34:15.393 --> 34:16.795
over killing a white man.

34:17.664 --> 34:18.563
Maybe I have

34:18.597 --> 34:21.701
you to thank for some of
the little pebbles in my garden.

34:22.870 --> 34:25.237
We're not here to fight, Mr. Powell.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.172
We just want to talk.

34:27.757 --> 34:30.543
When you're ready to do that,
we'll be at the bar.

34:35.681 --> 34:37.809
What do you want us to do?

34:39.185 --> 34:40.728
Keep an eye on 'em.

34:41.521 --> 34:44.190
Make sure they don't disturb my guests.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.324
Sir?

34:46.818 --> 34:48.261
It's not a problem until it's a problem.

34:48.293 --> 34:49.696
It may be one soon.

34:50.530 --> 34:54.065
Francis. He's on his way back
with a surprise for you.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.702
From England.

34:59.279 --> 35:00.606
How much time do we have?

35:00.707 --> 35:02.775
Boat was supposed to
dock ten minutes ago.

35:05.587 --> 35:07.281
Get these people out of here.

35:08.548 --> 35:11.284
Politely and discreetly.

35:21.126 --> 35:22.862
I apologize, gentlemen,
but it looks like

35:22.896 --> 35:24.940
we're gonna have
to call the night early.

36:58.408 --> 37:00.193
I am sorry.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.229
I-I can't eat.

37:03.872 --> 37:05.231
I can't hardly sleep
thinkin' that something

37:05.264 --> 37:08.101
th-that I done did made
you walk into that water.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.339
I love you, Stine.

37:15.508 --> 37:16.953
A-And I promise

37:17.787 --> 37:20.113
I ain't never gonna raise a hand
to you again.

37:22.265 --> 37:25.052
You ain't never raised no hand to me.

37:29.189 --> 37:31.399
You don't even know me.

37:36.229 --> 37:39.399
Wh-What you mean I don't know you?

37:39.432 --> 37:41.001
I-I know you.

37:41.367 --> 37:43.703
Hicks, you don't even know yourself.

37:44.245 --> 37:47.541
This thing we do, hurting
each other over and over,

37:47.573 --> 37:49.175
we ain't come up with it.

37:49.209 --> 37:51.111
We just retellin' the story
they wrote for us.

37:51.961 --> 37:53.680
You get hit out in them fields.

37:53.713 --> 37:55.749
And that shame come and hit me.
And I let you,

37:55.782 --> 37:58.251
'cause I got so much shame
of my own for the things I done

37:58.284 --> 38:00.586
to survive that I think I deserve it.

38:00.619 --> 38:03.589
No. No, that's that gal.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.592
Yeah, I seen y'all together.

38:05.624 --> 38:08.027
She done got your ear
and she's sourin' you on me.

38:08.061 --> 38:09.930
It's over.

38:09.963 --> 38:11.481
After all I done for you?

38:12.899 --> 38:14.802
That's it?

38:16.694 --> 38:18.637
You think you somethin' special.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.107
You ain't.

38:20.139 --> 38:21.540
You just like them empty blue bottles

38:21.573 --> 38:23.409
up in that table-tapper there tree.

38:23.443 --> 38:25.078
All the good inside you been used up.

38:25.411 --> 38:26.813
And now you empty,

38:27.413 --> 38:28.581
tossed out.

38:29.082 --> 38:30.817
Just 'cause you was once
in the big house lookin' down

38:30.849 --> 38:32.685
on the rest of us don't mean nothin'.

38:34.671 --> 38:36.222
You're right.

38:37.132 --> 38:39.225
Bein' in the big house, layin' with you,

38:39.258 --> 38:40.802
the opiates,

38:41.594 --> 38:43.963
they all just different ways
of enduring life

38:43.997 --> 38:45.732
instead of living it.

38:45.764 --> 38:47.667
I'm done with all that.

38:54.107 --> 38:56.110
No, you ain't.

39:00.238 --> 39:01.948
You'll be back.

39:14.394 --> 39:15.753
Whoa.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.631
We should keep moving.

39:18.670 --> 39:20.306
We've been riding for miles.
If they haven't stopped us by now,

39:20.333 --> 39:21.759
they're not going to.

39:25.847 --> 39:27.840
I'm headed to Philadelphia soon.

39:27.874 --> 39:29.276
The General's agreed to speak publicly

39:29.309 --> 39:31.278
to a small group
of likeminded individuals.

39:31.311 --> 39:32.612
The General?

39:32.644 --> 39:34.113
That's what the Captain calls Harriet.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.115
I didn't know they knew each other.

39:36.482 --> 39:37.851
Met at the start of the year.

39:38.151 --> 39:39.619
He was completely taken with her.

39:39.651 --> 39:41.404
She's agreed to recruit for him.

39:42.530 --> 39:43.356
Recruit?

39:43.389 --> 39:44.791
Captain's always looking

39:44.823 --> 39:47.159
for quiet men of principle
to be soldiers.

39:48.411 --> 39:50.729
Quiet men of principle.

39:50.762 --> 39:53.732
My husband John would have fit
that description.

39:54.292 --> 39:58.087
I wonder what he would have
thought about Mr. Brown's war.

39:58.922 --> 40:00.707
What do you think of it?

40:00.740 --> 40:02.842
You should come with us
to hear Harriet speak.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.335
Get off me! Get off me!

40:12.893 --> 40:14.261
You know what we do

40:14.295 --> 40:15.730
with nigger-loving slave-stealers?

40:19.734 --> 40:21.819
Your friend want to be white.

40:22.303 --> 40:23.939
That mean you want to be a nigger?

40:23.971 --> 40:26.449
'Cause I'll brand you like one.

40:29.076 --> 40:30.444
Do it.

40:30.478 --> 40:31.546
What'd you say?

40:33.473 --> 40:36.443
I am sick of hiding.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.211
I'm sick of secrets.

40:38.245 --> 40:40.647
I am a slave-stealer!

40:40.680 --> 40:43.116
So if you're gonna brand me, do it!

40:43.149 --> 40:44.984
Keep talkin' and
you're gonna get an SS carved...

40:45.017 --> 40:46.286
Do it!

40:48.821 --> 40:50.790
I'm gonna leave you out
here for the animals.

40:52.725 --> 40:54.961
We'll be watching you.

40:55.645 --> 40:57.730
You don't stop what you're doin'...

40:59.040 --> 41:01.202
...I'll come find you again.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.190
All right, let's talk.

41:42.483 --> 41:44.245
We're looking for the Black Rose.

41:45.862 --> 41:47.283
Never heard of her.

41:48.531 --> 41:50.116
You knew her as Rosalee.

41:52.452 --> 41:53.953
House girl.

41:54.888 --> 41:57.458
I heard she did a number on you.

41:59.167 --> 42:00.794
And your boy.

42:03.296 --> 42:04.932
And I know she was running
slaves, but I didn't know

42:04.964 --> 42:07.267
she was bumping
into the likes of you all.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.938
But if you want to catch her,
I could tell you the secret.

42:11.763 --> 42:13.073
Step one...

42:15.975 --> 42:17.144
...get out of my house!

42:26.285 --> 42:27.620
Let's all be careful.

42:28.171 --> 42:29.289
That bust

42:29.323 --> 42:31.759
of Emperor Napoleon is an original

42:31.792 --> 42:33.294
Ferdinand Barbedienne.

42:35.178 --> 42:36.263
Only one made.

42:38.397 --> 42:40.366
Which means it's expensive.

42:40.700 --> 42:42.936
Wouldn't want any bullet holes in it.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.807
But you know what?

42:46.839 --> 42:49.108
I can afford it. Shoot them!

43:27.180 --> 43:28.965
Let's try this again.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.218
How can we get to the Black Rose?

43:33.185 --> 43:34.888
You want to get at the house girl,

43:34.921 --> 43:36.323
you got to go through her momma.

43:36.356 --> 43:38.658
She the only thing that girl care about.

43:38.691 --> 43:40.860
Well, see, that wasn't
so hard, now was it?

43:40.894 --> 43:42.495
You got what you want, now leave.

43:44.522 --> 43:45.524
Cato!

44:17.596 --> 44:19.066
Noah.

44:22.602 --> 44:25.506
Earlier, you asked what happened to me

44:25.539 --> 44:27.732
since last time I saw you.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.277
I said it don't matter, but it do.

44:32.044 --> 44:34.814
Ain't neither of us the same
people that ran together.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.885
Now, that boy you met
in the whipping shed?

44:39.785 --> 44:42.289
All he cared about was getting North.

44:42.747 --> 44:44.024
To freedom.

44:44.749 --> 44:46.093
'Cause that's what they make you think,

44:46.125 --> 44:49.378
that freedom is a place.

44:50.296 --> 44:51.923
But it ain't.

44:53.265 --> 44:56.803
We make ourselves free
by the choices we make.

44:59.573 --> 45:00.941
While I was in that jail,

45:00.973 --> 45:03.392
I did just three things.

45:04.276 --> 45:05.561
First,

45:06.446 --> 45:08.549
I thought about you every minute.

45:09.732 --> 45:11.417
Second,

45:12.193 --> 45:16.030
I built the house we gonna live
in brick by brick in my head.

45:16.610 --> 45:20.114
All you got to do is pick a nice
plot of land to call home.

45:21.911 --> 45:23.396
And third...

45:24.830 --> 45:26.033
well...

45:38.094 --> 45:41.764
...third, I... I made you this.

46:04.069 --> 46:05.238
Rose.

46:10.835 --> 46:15.148
My first choice as a free man

46:15.715 --> 46:16.916
is you.

46:28.361 --> 46:30.029
I'll follow you anywhere.

47:16.075 --> 47:18.578
You should be coming with us down South.

47:18.611 --> 47:21.581
I think I'm going to stick
around here for a bit.

47:21.615 --> 47:23.417
This is a really nice house.

47:28.754 --> 47:30.557
You two bring Momma back.

47:48.774 --> 47:51.278
Stine, Stine.

47:51.310 --> 47:52.879
It work.

47:52.912 --> 47:55.781
He asked me to come by
the stable again tomorrow.

47:56.107 --> 47:57.783
We kissed.

47:57.816 --> 47:59.552
Ain't gonna be long 'fore he do

47:59.586 --> 48:02.089
whatever I want him for do.

48:02.122 --> 48:03.957
Good.

48:05.825 --> 48:09.096
'Cause you gonna use him
to get me off this island.
