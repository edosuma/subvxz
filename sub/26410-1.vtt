What are you on about?

15:32.158 --> 15:34.095
They're all the same.

15:44.504 --> 15:46.505
Well this is nonsense.

15:46.507 --> 15:48.309
Nonsense.

15:48.508 --> 15:51.145
Am I the only one here
with any sense whatsoever?

16:17.872 --> 16:19.739
It won't budge, Dad.

16:19.741 --> 16:21.807
Oh, this can't be happening.

16:21.809 --> 16:23.746
I'm giving birth
in two weeks.

16:24.712 --> 16:27.380
It's got to be a natural
disaster or something.

16:27.382 --> 16:29.451
But who would lock us in?

16:29.784 --> 16:31.618
Could it be
a reality show?

16:31.620 --> 16:33.619
Some sort of awful game?

16:33.621 --> 16:36.758
That's it!
That's got to be it.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.394
It's too insane
to be really real.

16:39.396 --> 16:41.296
We could be on camera
right now!

16:41.298 --> 16:42.766
No, it's the authorities.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.399
- You think?
- Well obviously.

16:45.401 --> 16:50.370
There's been an incident
and we've been quarantined

16:50.372 --> 16:54.408
until they regain control
of the situation.

16:54.410 --> 16:55.643
I suppose.

16:55.645 --> 16:57.477
Well, you said it yourself,
didn't you.

16:57.479 --> 16:59.647
I mean, these shutters
are all metal.

16:59.649 --> 17:01.586
They surround
the entire house.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.486
Only the government could
manage something like that.

17:05.488 --> 17:07.522
It still doesn't explain
the pipes.

17:07.525 --> 17:09.724
They poke into every room.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.926
Well, they could be there
to vent in clean oxygen,

17:11.929 --> 17:12.928
couldn't they?

17:12.930 --> 17:14.665
Well, it's possible,
isn't it?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.667
You know, there really are
some ingenious people

17:19.670 --> 17:21.936
and sensible people working
in the government these days,

17:21.939 --> 17:23.407
so believe me.

17:24.509 --> 17:26.409
So from now on we keep
all the windows open,

17:26.411 --> 17:28.812
let the vents do there job,
lets let the air in.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.383
Scott, if you can help me.

17:31.349 --> 17:32.815
I'm calling the Police.

17:32.817 --> 17:34.554
I'll check the News.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.824
<i>You all better come see this.</i>

17:44.630 --> 17:46.632
It's overriding every channel.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.305
Well, what does it mean?

17:51.770 --> 17:54.572
It has to be the emergency
government broadcast.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.841
In the aftermath of 7/7

17:56.843 --> 17:59.844
we learnt that the
authorities reserved

17:59.846 --> 18:02.479
an emergency frequency

18:02.481 --> 18:03.913
that would come into play
in the event

18:03.915 --> 18:06.319
that the networks
were knocked out.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.486
It's a nuke, isn't it!

18:08.488 --> 18:11.822
I saw it on the TV.
It's the EMU pulse.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.558
Electromagnetic pulse.
E. M. P.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.331
Oh, you think
you're so clever.

18:18.932 --> 18:19.730
I don't think it can be.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.832
All the electrics
would be fried.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.566
The TV would be dead.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.868
And our phones
are still working,

18:23.870 --> 18:25.370
there's just no network.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.771
Well, why have all the
clocks stopped working

18:26.773 --> 18:28.342
at the same time, then?

18:29.843 --> 18:32.780
I... can't answer that.

18:34.615 --> 18:35.514
I still can't work out

18:35.516 --> 18:37.353
how we all managed
to sleep through it?

18:39.687 --> 18:43.324
Look, we haven't even
checked online yet.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.771
<i>That's the fifth try.
Nothing.</i>

19:28.772 --> 19:30.340
Dead.

19:34.110 --> 19:35.777
No internet.

19:35.779 --> 19:37.581
Landlines dead.

19:38.648 --> 19:40.985
No communication
outside of this house.

19:51.595 --> 19:52.797
Scott?

19:56.934 --> 19:58.670
Yeah?

20:00.138 --> 20:02.006
Can I count on you, Scott?

20:07.011 --> 20:08.543
Uh yeah.
Sure, Tone.

20:08.545 --> 20:09.677
No worries.

20:09.679 --> 20:12.418
You see I need to know
you'll back me.

20:14.519 --> 20:16.521
We need to be shepherds.

20:17.656 --> 20:21.627
Protect the herd,
even from themselves.

20:22.894 --> 20:25.829
We're men, Scott,
and sometimes we're called upon

20:25.831 --> 20:28.134
to do things
that no one else will.

20:30.502 --> 20:32.835
I say to my team at work,

20:32.837 --> 20:35.874
be your best
on your worst day.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.113
Okay?

20:40.779 --> 20:42.849
- Yeah, Tone, sure.
- Good.

20:55.828 --> 20:56.863
Careful.

21:06.172 --> 21:09.877
Okay, so we need
to puzzle this out.

21:10.244 --> 21:11.342
Well, the message
clearly shows

21:11.344 --> 21:14.045
that the authorities
have the attack under control.

21:14.047 --> 21:18.018
So, we sit tight.
Await for rescue.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.484
Right.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.086
No one said anything
about an attack.

21:22.088 --> 21:24.524
It's Christmas Day.

21:24.526 --> 21:27.160
It's the perfect
time to strike.

21:27.162 --> 21:30.729
The day of the year when our
defenses are at their lowest.

21:30.731 --> 21:33.635
Lot's of them don't even
celebrate Christmas.

21:34.068 --> 21:36.038
If it's an attack.

21:36.872 --> 21:38.774
[sighs and faints]

21:41.742 --> 21:43.743
- It's alright, love.
- Careful. Careful.

21:43.745 --> 21:45.014
It's okay.

21:45.646 --> 21:47.916
It will be okay.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.586
Right, we need to wait
for more instructions,

21:53.588 --> 21:54.921
but in the meantime,

21:54.923 --> 21:57.991
we are going to celebrate
this special day

21:57.993 --> 21:59.895
as we would any other year.

22:01.062 --> 22:02.997
If we don't uphold our values

22:02.999 --> 22:05.865
and have a proper
British Christmas

22:05.867 --> 22:07.535
the terrorists
have already won.

22:07.537 --> 22:08.939
Here. Here.

22:13.844 --> 22:16.113
[indistinct chatter]

22:40.304 --> 22:42.006
Dear Lord...

22:46.043 --> 22:48.043
Dear Lord, for what
we are about to receive

22:48.045 --> 22:50.112
let us be truly thankful.

22:50.114 --> 22:51.948
We thank you for our health

22:51.950 --> 22:55.084
and the presence of our family
in this trying time.

22:55.086 --> 22:57.319
We do not try to guess
your grand design,

22:57.321 --> 22:59.721
but rather look to the
example set by your son

22:59.723 --> 23:01.194
who was born on this day.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.162
He knew his duty.

23:06.197 --> 23:09.234
With your Grace we shall
preserve and we shall prevail.

23:09.834 --> 23:10.834
Amen.

23:10.836 --> 23:12.639
[coughs]

23:14.173 --> 23:16.106
What's wrong with her now?

23:16.108 --> 23:17.808
I've got a cold starting.

23:17.810 --> 23:19.878
Annji's got a touch of flu,
Gramps.

23:20.678 --> 23:22.646
She got you wrapped
around her pinky.

23:22.648 --> 23:24.214
Your cunt struck
good and proper.

23:24.216 --> 23:25.215
- Alfred, please!
- Dad!

23:25.217 --> 23:26.917
That was fucking bang
out of order, Gramps!

23:26.919 --> 23:28.852
- Apologize now!
- Nah.

23:28.854 --> 23:31.121
Maybe Annji picked up
something by accident?

23:31.123 --> 23:33.156
We don't know
what's going on out there.

23:33.158 --> 23:36.194
Could be an infection
like sarin or...

23:36.196 --> 23:38.128
Sarin's a nerve gas,
not an infection.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.931
Or, or plutonium then.

23:39.933 --> 23:42.000
Also, not an infection.

23:42.002 --> 23:43.300
I know that!
I'm not stupid!

23:43.302 --> 23:45.002
Look, let's just eat.

23:45.004 --> 23:47.107
We'll think a lot clearer
with some food inside us.

23:47.741 --> 23:48.874
This is a farce.

23:48.876 --> 23:49.841
The world could be ending

23:49.843 --> 23:51.776
and we're shoveling
sprouts into our faces.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.647
Oh, I bet it'd be different
if it was one of your holidays.

23:54.649 --> 23:56.115
Can everyone
please stop shouting.

23:56.117 --> 23:57.149
Look, come on,

23:57.151 --> 23:59.150
Mum's spent ages on this,
it looks delicious.

23:59.152 --> 24:00.886
If I'm infected,
then you are, too.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.754
You and laughing boy
arrived after we did...

24:02.756 --> 24:04.289
Can you not have
a go at us.

24:04.291 --> 24:06.925
We're a family and this woman
is carrying my baby, okay.

24:06.927 --> 24:08.761
So, I've had enough,
no more.

24:08.763 --> 24:10.294
Don't trust her!

24:10.296 --> 24:12.031
When I was stationed
in the Middle East

24:12.033 --> 24:13.300
they had tricks to fool you.

24:13.302 --> 24:15.334
Gramps, you don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

24:15.336 --> 24:18.873
- You just carry on...
- Be quiet!

24:22.843 --> 24:24.713
Please.

24:26.180 --> 24:27.783
Now,

24:28.382 --> 24:30.315
I'm about to carve
the turkey.

24:30.317 --> 24:31.920
Ooh.

24:32.153 --> 24:33.823
Look!

24:42.465 --> 24:44.098
Well, there is nothing
to discuss,

24:44.100 --> 24:48.835
because I refuse to entertain
your clever notions

24:48.837 --> 24:51.207
that could put this family's
health at risk.

24:52.709 --> 24:54.044
Dad.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.877
You are useless.

24:56.879 --> 24:59.882
Sitting there like a lump
while my dad takes charge.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.485
What can I do?

25:03.487 --> 25:06.220
You're always telling
everyone what a man you are.

25:06.222 --> 25:08.759
Here's your chance.
Prove it.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.863
Protect your family.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.295
End of.

25:14.297 --> 25:16.433
Dad, it's our food.

25:19.803 --> 25:20.669
Oh, so now you know better

25:20.671 --> 25:23.471
than disaster management team,
do you?

25:23.473 --> 25:26.374
All I'm saying is,
lets take a step back,

25:26.376 --> 25:28.246
and take stock
for a second...

25:29.913 --> 25:31.717
What are you doing?

25:32.349 --> 25:33.918
You know.

25:35.487 --> 25:37.886
Alright, but how long
might this last?

25:37.888 --> 25:40.055
The TV said
nothing about water

25:40.057 --> 25:42.327
and you can live
for weeks without food.

25:43.394 --> 25:44.760
When I raised money
for Comic Relief

25:44.762 --> 25:47.229
I ate nothing but energy
bars for a month.

25:47.231 --> 25:49.335
The organizers were amazed.

25:49.934 --> 25:51.501
We've got a pregnant woman...

25:51.503 --> 25:53.336
Don't use me as an excuse!

25:53.338 --> 25:56.208
I'm strong.
I'm a team player.

25:57.876 --> 25:59.076
We won't be able
to risk the tap water,

25:59.078 --> 26:01.979
but I did instruct your mother
to get some bottled water

26:01.981 --> 26:05.348
in for the holidays,
so we'll ration that.

26:05.350 --> 26:07.183
Well, I hope that lasts
long enough.

26:07.185 --> 26:09.118
- Oh, we'll cope.
- Yeah.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.123
That's it, walk away.

26:25.172 --> 26:27.471
Don't you ever
undermine me

26:27.473 --> 26:29.273
in front of the others again.

26:29.275 --> 26:32.112
You are no longer
the head of this family.

26:33.847 --> 26:35.579
Alright,

26:35.581 --> 26:37.982
but it's not so easy
when there's no head office

26:37.984 --> 26:40.789
to check in with,
is it, Squelcher?

26:43.023 --> 26:46.895
Act decisively,
with iron authority.

26:48.295 --> 26:49.928
Take him,

26:49.930 --> 26:52.366
he won't obey you when
it really matters, you know.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.935
If you'd been harder
on him as a lad

26:56.937 --> 27:00.308
he wouldn't have grown up
to thumb his cock at authority.

27:02.377 --> 27:05.481
Didn't do you any harm,
did it, Squelcher?

27:06.380 --> 27:08.083
It's changed again.

27:11.587 --> 27:14.221
"Decontaminate yourselves.

27:14.223 --> 27:17.326
Strip and scrub all flesh
with household bleach."

27:18.392 --> 27:21.096
Beth,
get the cleaning products.

27:29.438 --> 27:31.874
Do we really think
it's an infection?

27:33.141 --> 27:34.975
We don't know
what's outside.

27:34.977 --> 27:36.944
We should probably go through
with it, just in case.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.314
[sighs]

27:43.218 --> 27:45.221
That really is minging.

27:45.955 --> 27:46.920
See?

27:46.922 --> 27:48.492
[chuckles]

27:49.025 --> 27:52.561
Although, I did actually
bring some decorations

27:52.563 --> 27:56.100
from downstairs up here.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.504
[chuckles]

28:03.506 --> 28:06.110
[distant laughter]

28:16.020 --> 28:18.454
I don't understand
why we're doing this.

28:18.456 --> 28:20.255
Well, because
there is a chance

28:20.257 --> 28:21.457
that some of the
poisonous dust

28:21.459 --> 28:23.392
might have settled
on our bodies,

28:23.394 --> 28:24.660
in our hair.

28:24.662 --> 28:27.229
We may have walked it
into the house.

28:27.231 --> 28:28.968
It could be on our clothes.

28:32.403 --> 28:34.973
Do you remember
when we were first married,

28:36.008 --> 28:38.478
how we used to take
baths together?

28:42.715 --> 28:44.451
What are you doing?

28:45.050 --> 28:47.887
This isn't a game, Beth.
It's life or death.

28:50.256 --> 28:53.556
Right, so, I suggest we start
with our armpits and crotch,

28:53.558 --> 28:55.295
and go from there.

29:04.104 --> 29:06.407
It could be terrorism
though, couldn't it?

29:08.208 --> 29:10.307
Yeah,

29:10.309 --> 29:13.647
and if it is,
we'll get through it together.

29:15.182 --> 29:16.951
We're a team.

29:39.374 --> 29:41.007
[knocking]

29:41.009 --> 29:42.577
<i>You okay in there, Dad?</i>

29:44.345 --> 29:47.249
I can still scrub
my own balls!

29:47.615 --> 29:49.618
<i>I'll be down the hall
if you need me.</i>

29:51.420 --> 29:52.956
[sighs]

29:54.623 --> 29:56.426
[knocking]

29:59.228 --> 30:01.531
<i>Will you come
downstairs, please.</i>

30:07.502 --> 30:11.171
Your mother has
persuaded me that...

30:11.173 --> 30:14.645
sometimes I'm too hard
on other people

30:15.677 --> 30:18.378
because of the high standard
I set myself.

30:18.380 --> 30:20.050
Ha!

30:20.817 --> 30:24.818
Well okay, we've all been
under a lot of pressure so,

30:24.820 --> 30:26.587
I'm sorry, too.

30:26.589 --> 30:28.658
Well, I didn't say
I was sorry.

30:29.559 --> 30:32.827
Everything I have done
has been to help this family.

30:32.829 --> 30:35.031
Okay, then I apologize.

30:41.338 --> 30:43.204
I'm sorry, too.

30:43.206 --> 30:44.641
I was nervous about
meeting you...

30:45.810 --> 30:47.078
[gasps]

30:47.744 --> 30:49.144
Annj, no.

30:49.146 --> 30:51.148
No, leave that for me,
please.

31:03.494 --> 31:05.398
Hypodermics.

31:10.668 --> 31:14.305
Okay, who is going
to do it then?

31:19.578 --> 31:21.414
It's not sealed.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.149
These have been used already.

31:26.151 --> 31:27.283
No.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.785
It is for our own good.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.487
It really isn't.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.325
Lets just talk
about this sensibly.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.891
It's an order.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.894
It's a fucking teletext page.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.161
Do you know how dangerous

31:38.163 --> 31:40.467
unsterilized medical
equipment is?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.453
Dad.

32:24.879 --> 32:26.582
I'm fine.

32:27.215 --> 32:28.851
Who's next?

32:34.855 --> 32:37.726
Okay, they're sterilized.

32:54.610 --> 32:56.246
[grunts]

33:32.883 --> 33:34.486
Come here.

33:35.252 --> 33:36.554
Cowards.

33:41.325 --> 33:43.327
Dad, be careful.

33:57.975 --> 33:59.878
Mum, please don't.

34:05.017 --> 34:07.953
Beth, we're just trying
to keep everyone safe.

34:34.746 --> 34:35.916
Come on, babe.

34:36.716 --> 34:38.619
Your turn,
you can do it.

34:39.385 --> 34:43.021
The baby...
I can't risk the baby.

34:43.023 --> 34:44.922
You've got to do it.

34:44.925 --> 34:47.824
Don't say that!
Don't tell me what to do!

34:47.827 --> 34:49.830
Come on,
you saw the message.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.632
It's the only way we can
make sure everyone's safe.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.402
No, no.

34:56.601 --> 34:58.773
Dad, please don't
make me choose.

34:59.473 --> 35:00.505
I can't.

35:00.507 --> 35:03.909
Kate, don't listen to them.

35:03.911 --> 35:05.844
We could risk losing
both of you.

35:05.846 --> 35:07.480
Be quiet.

35:07.482 --> 35:08.915
You heard what Annji said

35:08.917 --> 35:10.516
and she's the only one
with any medical training.

35:10.518 --> 35:12.752
We don't know what's in
those syringes, do we?

35:12.754 --> 35:14.520
I'm warning you.

35:14.522 --> 35:15.688
All of you!

35:15.690 --> 35:16.956
Y-you're pulling at me like

35:16.958 --> 35:19.424
dogs fighting
over a pork chop!

35:19.426 --> 35:20.426
I can't breath!

35:20.428 --> 35:22.665
Just...
let me think.

35:42.084 --> 35:43.520
Good girl.

35:54.765 --> 35:56.634
Two left.

36:10.714 --> 36:12.084
Annj,

36:15.420 --> 36:16.921
we don't have a choice.

36:42.046 --> 36:44.683
Good, now we're safe.

36:46.051 --> 36:48.054
[gurgling]

36:48.986 --> 36:50.389
Dad?

36:54.993 --> 36:56.395
Dad?

36:58.596 --> 37:00.500
[all scream]

37:01.967 --> 37:04.036
[gasping]

37:08.842 --> 37:11.144
[screaming]
Oh, no!

37:15.481 --> 37:17.451
[crying]

37:21.019 --> 37:22.489
Dad?

37:23.756 --> 37:24.992
Dad?

37:25.892 --> 37:27.961
[crying]

37:34.535 --> 37:36.870
[crying continues]

37:43.276 --> 37:44.912
I told you!

37:45.912 --> 37:47.847
I told you!

37:47.849 --> 37:50.183
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't...

37:50.185 --> 37:52.217
It doesn't make any sense.

37:52.219 --> 37:54.253
W-what about the rest of us?

37:54.255 --> 37:56.021
I mean,
that stuff is in Kate

37:56.023 --> 37:57.990
and my baby!

37:57.992 --> 38:00.559
You told us it would be okay!
You promised!

38:00.561 --> 38:03.165
He was an old man
and old men die.

38:03.898 --> 38:06.199
Are you trying to say
this was a coincidence?

38:06.201 --> 38:10.068
Well, maybe the same thing
would have happened to us,

38:10.070 --> 38:12.071
if we hadn't taken it.

38:12.073 --> 38:14.542
It just didn't work on him.

38:14.544 --> 38:16.743
Maybe it was
an allergic reaction?

38:16.745 --> 38:18.745
You've got
to be kidding me.

38:18.747 --> 38:20.617
No, but it's possible,
isn't it?

38:21.950 --> 38:26.555
He died because the
medicine didn't work?

38:29.124 --> 38:31.124
I will not have my,

38:31.126 --> 38:33.863
my father's sacrifice
undermined.

38:35.866 --> 38:40.034
Now we all took the shot
and only Dad was affected.

38:40.036 --> 38:41.670
We don't know why

38:41.672 --> 38:43.840
and that's all
we know right now.

38:46.777 --> 38:49.813
If we hadn't taken the drug,
we might all have died.

38:52.081 --> 38:53.850
So this, this, this is...

38:55.118 --> 38:57.688
well, it is
an acceptable loss.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.129
What slot?

39:08.899 --> 39:10.865
Right Scott, go upstairs

39:10.867 --> 39:13.868
and get some sheets
to cover the body,

39:13.870 --> 39:16.207
and collect up
all the syringes.

39:17.274 --> 39:19.010
[clicks fingers]

39:24.350 --> 39:27.286
We can't carry on like this
with your dad in charge.

39:28.987 --> 39:31.024
We have to find a way out.

39:32.625 --> 39:34.193
There must be something
we've missed.

39:41.033 --> 39:43.036
[tearing]

39:47.840 --> 39:49.642
It's everywhere.

39:53.713 --> 39:55.749
[distant thud]

40:33.187 --> 40:34.187
Help!

40:34.355 --> 40:36.055
<i>Help us please!</i>

40:36.057 --> 40:37.893
<i>Help! Help!</i>

40:38.360 --> 40:39.961
Argh!

40:42.864 --> 40:44.699
Ah!

40:48.704 --> 40:50.806
[screams of pain]

40:52.273 --> 40:54.743
I just can't understand
how it's happened.

40:58.112 --> 41:00.249
Take another swig, babe.

41:01.783 --> 41:03.384
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

41:03.386 --> 41:06.223
It'll be okay...
Oh God, oh God, oh...

41:39.021 --> 41:40.991
What an end to Boxing Day.

41:47.265 --> 41:49.033
Bye, Gramps.

41:51.336 --> 41:53.205
Squelcher.

41:54.539 --> 41:56.008
What?

41:57.809 --> 41:59.845
Squelcher.

42:02.147 --> 42:05.247
You called me Squelcher.

42:05.249 --> 42:07.149
Why?

42:07.151 --> 42:09.153
"Because you wet the bed."

42:11.422 --> 42:13.325
Just once,
when I was little.

42:14.426 --> 42:16.226
Why?

42:16.228 --> 42:19.429
Because I was scared.

42:19.431 --> 42:22.166
I was scared of waking you,

42:22.168 --> 42:25.138
by flushing the chain
after curfew.

42:28.007 --> 42:30.040
You heard me crying

42:30.042 --> 42:32.779
and you let me
lay there all night.

42:34.913 --> 42:38.017
And in the morning,
you battered me blue.

42:44.024 --> 42:46.327
"Real men can hold it."

42:50.497 --> 42:56.066
You see, I live with
the understanding

42:56.068 --> 42:59.240
that there's a greater
purpose than myself.

43:02.542 --> 43:05.312
Everything happens
for a reason,

43:06.913 --> 43:08.350
even this.

43:09.884 --> 43:11.253
Dad.

43:12.053 --> 43:14.890
You have no idea
what it's like to be a father.

43:17.491 --> 43:21.259
Always trying to choose
the right path.

43:21.261 --> 43:23.865
Always worried
about your children.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.371
Even when they vanish
for years without a calling.

43:33.642 --> 43:35.812
He knew.

43:37.246 --> 43:39.414
I know.

43:44.519 --> 43:46.522
You don't know.

43:52.160 --> 43:54.864
[distant rumble]

44:04.140 --> 44:05.142
<i>Whose next?</i>

44:05.575 --> 44:08.011
[screaming]
<i>Squelcher.</i>

44:09.678 --> 44:11.181
<i>The baby...</i>

44:12.248 --> 44:14.351
<i>I can't risk with the baby.</i>

44:27.597 --> 44:29.164
Come downstairs.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.934
There's something
we need to discuss.

44:38.042 --> 44:39.642
It doesn't say
who is infected.

44:39.644 --> 44:40.944
So how do we know?

44:40.946 --> 44:43.212
It doesn't have to.
It's obvious.

44:43.214 --> 44:43.980
It's a cold.

44:43.982 --> 44:45.580
She had it
before she came here

44:45.582 --> 44:47.382
and she's got a name, Kate!

44:47.384 --> 44:48.551
Calm down, Nick.

44:48.553 --> 44:50.352
This isn't a fight
we can win.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.321
Well, you said it.

44:51.323 --> 44:53.288
Kate, if you weren't
my sister, I swear...

44:53.290 --> 44:56.426
Oi, don't even think it.

44:56.428 --> 44:59.164
You are risking
everyone's life.

45:00.032 --> 45:01.432
Angela clearly
contracted something

45:01.434 --> 45:03.300
on her emergency shift.

45:03.302 --> 45:05.735
Who thinks Annji's the
one we should quarantine?

45:05.737 --> 45:08.174
Don't do it.
Don't you dare.

45:12.378 --> 45:14.280
Mum, say something, please.

45:15.347 --> 45:17.384
Mum. Mum!

45:18.650 --> 45:20.451
The majority has spoken.

45:20.453 --> 45:22.353
- Scott, get her.
- Put her upstairs.

45:22.355 --> 45:23.687
Nick, no!

45:23.689 --> 45:25.158
[grunting]

45:35.769 --> 45:37.537
Get off him!

45:38.604 --> 45:40.738
[singing] Ding dong,
merrily on high

45:40.740 --> 45:43.508
In heaven the bells
are ringing

45:43.510 --> 45:45.609
Ding dong,
verily the sky

45:45.611 --> 45:48.480
Is riv'n
with angel singing

45:48.482 --> 45:51.319
Gloria...

45:54.087 --> 45:56.288
Shush... shush, shush.

45:56.290 --> 46:00.027
- Hosanna in excelsis.
- It's okay, Beth.

46:02.295 --> 46:04.396
You can't lock her in there
with Granddad's body!

46:04.398 --> 46:05.730
We hung up a sheet round it.

46:05.732 --> 46:08.099
Oh, like a plague ward?

46:08.101 --> 46:10.369
We have our instructions.

46:10.371 --> 46:12.372
Isolate the dead.

46:12.374 --> 46:13.743
The infected.

46:14.776 --> 46:16.142
No.

46:16.144 --> 46:18.544
Nick!
It's okay.

46:18.546 --> 46:20.983
I've been around
dead people before.

46:21.483 --> 46:23.151
Please.

46:41.237 --> 46:44.241
<i>Annj, you okay?</i>

46:45.208 --> 46:46.577
I love you.

46:48.478 --> 46:50.411
Do you believe those
pipes are to feed us air

46:50.413 --> 46:52.212
like your dad says?

46:52.214 --> 46:53.283
<i>No.</i>

46:54.150 --> 46:55.719
<i>Me neither.</i>

46:56.185 --> 46:59.220
<i>I don't think the messages
are a government broadcast.</i>

46:59.222 --> 47:02.124
It's almost like they're
reacting to what we do.

47:02.126 --> 47:04.158
That's a bit of a leap, Annj.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.030
Think about
the timing though.

47:07.497 --> 47:08.664
Every time
we overcome a problem

47:08.666 --> 47:10.399
it comes back
with something worse.

47:10.401 --> 47:11.803
Exactly.

47:12.336 --> 47:15.173
It's like there's someone
watching through the TV.

47:16.639 --> 47:19.173
I think you should try
switching it off and on.

47:19.175 --> 47:20.642
Just to see what happens.

47:20.644 --> 47:22.410
No.
No, I could never do that.

47:22.412 --> 47:24.147
That TV is Dad's
life line now.

47:24.149 --> 47:26.085
You have to try, Nick.

47:27.185 --> 47:29.455
<i>I know you can
stand up to him.</i>

47:31.156 --> 47:32.455
Annji, what if
I to turn it off

47:32.457 --> 47:34.125
and it just stays on?

48:07.827 --> 48:09.459
Uh...
You okay?

48:09.461 --> 48:10.463
Yeah.

48:11.430 --> 48:12.730
What you doing?

48:12.732 --> 48:14.299
Well, I need to pee.

48:14.301 --> 48:15.770
I always need to pee.

48:19.906 --> 48:21.806
Ah!

48:21.808 --> 48:23.875
Oh God.
You're not? Is this...

48:23.877 --> 48:27.281
[laughs]
Baby just doing the Tango.

48:30.350 --> 48:31.486
Could I?

48:32.218 --> 48:33.453
I mean...

48:41.862 --> 48:44.298
Oh, I felt it.

48:45.199 --> 48:46.501
It's amazing.

48:48.369 --> 48:49.835
Anyway, I better...

48:49.837 --> 48:51.840
Don't want to gush
everywhere.

49:06.321 --> 49:08.857
[indistinct conversation]

49:11.827 --> 49:13.796
You're not the boss of me.

49:17.999 --> 49:20.269
[TV buzzing]

49:23.473 --> 49:25.643
Ah!
What are you doing?

49:25.909 --> 49:27.942
It's nothing, Kate.
I am just testing a theory.

49:27.944 --> 49:30.510
Don't you patronize me,
you prick.

49:30.512 --> 49:32.380
It's been the same
since we were kids.

49:32.382 --> 49:34.282
You think you're so clever.

49:34.284 --> 49:35.717
You think you can do
anything you want.

49:35.719 --> 49:36.985
You're not better
than we are.

49:36.987 --> 49:38.686
- Kate...
- Dad'll put you in your place!

49:38.688 --> 49:40.420
- Just you wait and see...
- No, no, no, Kate.

49:40.422 --> 49:43.259
Dad!
Nick's broke the telly!

49:48.399 --> 49:49.298
What have you done?

49:49.300 --> 49:51.600
I'm just testing
something out, Dad.

49:51.602 --> 49:53.338
What have you done?!

49:55.439 --> 49:57.439
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

49:57.441 --> 49:58.577
No.

50:01.646 --> 50:02.981
Come on!

50:06.350 --> 50:08.820
[TV sounds]

50:19.998 --> 50:22.032
Oh, you couldn't leave
it alone, could you?

50:22.034 --> 50:23.666
You always have to be right!

50:23.668 --> 50:25.335
Calm down!
Nothing happened!

50:25.337 --> 50:27.404
Me and my baby could suffer
penalties because of you!

50:27.406 --> 50:28.938
- Stop!
- Don't touch her!

50:28.940 --> 50:30.976
[grunting]

50:38.418 --> 50:39.519
Go on! Get him!

50:42.354 --> 50:43.889
Get him, Scott!

50:47.760 --> 50:49.329
Ah!

50:50.662 --> 50:52.498
[thud, crack]

50:52.698 --> 50:54.334
Kate!

50:57.102 --> 50:59.473
[screaming in pain]

51:06.547 --> 51:08.080
Do something!
Help her!

51:08.082 --> 51:09.380
You have to do something!

51:09.382 --> 51:10.781
Stop shrieking, woman.
Let me think!

51:10.783 --> 51:11.750
How did this happen?

51:11.752 --> 51:13.585
We need to let Annji out!
She's a medic!

51:13.587 --> 51:14.819
Annji's infected!
I won't risk it!

51:14.821 --> 51:16.621
- But Kate might die, Dad!
- No!

51:16.623 --> 51:18.656
Scott, you work
in a hospital...

51:18.658 --> 51:20.025
Scott, do you know
what you're doing?

51:20.027 --> 51:21.529
You need to help us!

51:21.728 --> 51:23.028
Scott,
she's your fucking wife!

51:23.030 --> 51:24.632
Help her!

51:33.907 --> 51:35.877
[TV buzzing]

51:41.950 --> 51:44.019
[screaming in pain]

51:52.595 --> 51:53.660
Watch her head.

51:53.662 --> 51:55.094
Easy. Easy.

51:55.096 --> 51:56.496
Scott?

51:56.498 --> 51:57.364
Scott, stop that!

51:57.366 --> 52:00.400
Come on, come on
you need to help her!

52:00.402 --> 52:01.837
Hold her hand.

52:03.105 --> 52:04.103
It's alright.

52:04.105 --> 52:06.073
Mum, we need um,
water to clean the wounds.

52:06.075 --> 52:08.074
We need uh,
something to wrap it,

52:08.076 --> 52:09.509
you make her comfortable.

52:09.511 --> 52:10.979
Easy, come on.
Easy!

52:10.981 --> 52:11.979
Scott!

52:11.981 --> 52:13.680
Painkillers. Painkillers,
strong as we have.

52:13.682 --> 52:14.514
Come on!

52:14.516 --> 52:16.050
T-There's whiskey!
There's whiskey!

52:16.052 --> 52:19.487
No alcohol, no pills!
My baby!

52:19.489 --> 52:21.456
Okay, one second,
I need one of those.

52:21.458 --> 52:22.824
Come here.

52:22.826 --> 52:24.726
Is-is she...?

52:24.728 --> 52:25.827
She's passed out.

52:25.829 --> 52:26.762
Now with a wound like this,

52:26.764 --> 52:27.929
she will slip in and out
of consciousness.

52:27.931 --> 52:31.166
- Will the baby be alright?
- I have no fucking idea.

52:31.168 --> 52:33.467
- Will you please stop...
- Please don't swear, I know,

52:33.469 --> 52:35.671
but Mum, I don't know.
I'm sorry.

52:35.673 --> 52:38.174
Alright, I'm going to work
in the study.

52:38.176 --> 52:39.841
I don't want to be disturbed.

52:39.843 --> 52:40.642
What?

52:40.644 --> 52:42.011
Well, it's too noisy
down here,

52:42.013 --> 52:43.879
and you might be right.

52:43.881 --> 52:45.848
I think we need
a different approach.

52:45.850 --> 52:47.015
A new plan.

52:47.017 --> 52:49.051
Dad, you can't go,
it's Kate!

52:49.053 --> 52:50.652
Dad?!

52:50.654 --> 52:51.821
Fucking coward!

52:51.823 --> 52:54.857
Okay... um, easy, easy.

52:54.859 --> 52:56.991
We need some water
or something, Mum.

52:56.993 --> 52:58.931
Scott, come on!
Come on!

53:02.701 --> 53:04.971
[wailing in agony]

53:07.605 --> 53:10.809
Shush, shush, shush, hey!

53:15.012 --> 53:16.213
Oh, this is ridiculous.

53:16.215 --> 53:18.081
She's my child!

53:18.083 --> 53:19.819
Your sister.

53:20.819 --> 53:23.189
Um... hello.

53:25.225 --> 53:27.859
If you can hear me,
I'm Beth.

53:27.861 --> 53:29.193
Beth Milgram.

53:29.195 --> 53:34.531
I'm with my family
at 25 Stanford Street.

53:34.533 --> 53:38.169
We-we know you're busy but
we've had an awful accident.

53:38.171 --> 53:42.640
My daughter Kate,
she's broken her leg.

53:42.642 --> 53:47.112
It's when, when the bone...
Nick?

53:47.114 --> 53:50.949
- It's a compound fracture.
- It's a compound fracture.

53:50.951 --> 53:53.918
You sent the syringes.
Please help us again!

53:53.920 --> 53:57.655
She's my daughter Kate.

53:57.657 --> 53:59.657
She's pregnant.

53:59.659 --> 54:03.031
We love her.
I'm begging you...

54:04.697 --> 54:06.864
Please help.

54:06.866 --> 54:08.936
[crying]

54:09.837 --> 54:13.876
The um, the skin's tight
and there's...

54:15.943 --> 54:17.809
red streaks in the, uh,

54:17.811 --> 54:21.680
the-the veins that,

54:21.682 --> 54:22.881
the veins that are
coming away

54:22.883 --> 54:24.786
from the wound are dark.

54:26.220 --> 54:28.490
Nick, the wounds infected.

54:30.090 --> 54:32.560
<i>Sounds like sepsis
has set in.</i>

54:33.861 --> 54:35.862
If we don't get Kate
medical attention soon,

54:35.864 --> 54:37.234
she'll die.

54:39.268 --> 54:41.071
What about the baby?

54:43.973 --> 54:45.739
No.

54:45.741 --> 54:48.676
- Mum, please...
- No. I don't believe that.

54:48.678 --> 54:50.177
I won't.
I can't believe that.

54:50.179 --> 54:52.716
I can't, I can't, I can't.

54:53.815 --> 54:56.585
We'll talk about this later.
I've got a lot of work to do.

54:57.587 --> 55:00.322
- Mum, look I...
- No. I've got to get busy.

55:00.324 --> 55:02.256
Mo and the boys
are coming tomorrow

55:02.258 --> 55:04.728
and the place is such a tip.

55:09.599 --> 55:11.268
That's not going to happen,
Mum?

55:17.273 --> 55:18.773
[video recording]
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

55:18.775 --> 55:22.010
<i>Aw, everyone's here!
I'm so happy.</i>

55:22.012 --> 55:26.250
<i>Aw, Mum.
Aw, Gramps, love you!</i>

55:29.953 --> 55:33.558
We um,
we picked out names.

55:34.759 --> 55:37.896
We had Lewis
if it was a boy

55:38.863 --> 55:43.035
and we had Ruby
if it was a girl.

55:43.768 --> 55:46.802
Scott, the only way
Kate will recover

55:46.804 --> 55:48.905
is if we get help.

55:48.907 --> 55:50.807
We have to escape.

55:50.809 --> 55:54.147
We must follow the leader.

55:54.947 --> 55:57.150
Be shepherds for the flock.

55:57.749 --> 56:01.653
Our "leader"
has locked himself away.

56:02.787 --> 56:04.289
We can't rely on him.

56:04.923 --> 56:07.791
Scott, we have
to stop fighting

56:07.793 --> 56:09.695
and work together.

56:13.198 --> 56:17.835
There was, um,
there was something else...

56:17.837 --> 56:20.937
when-when Kate got hurt
and she was screaming.

56:20.939 --> 56:24.377
I-I thought it was my mind
playing tricks on me, but um...

56:28.682 --> 56:32.685
the-the message changed
when I was staring right at it.

56:34.387 --> 56:36.056
What did it say?

56:40.126 --> 56:41.929
"I see you."

56:46.333 --> 56:48.336
[banging]

56:48.969 --> 56:50.371
Dad?

56:53.808 --> 56:55.143
<i>Dad!</i>

57:22.404 --> 57:23.973
[bang]

57:49.265 --> 57:51.202
[coughing]

58:11.121 --> 58:15.159
Kate... myself and Annji.

58:19.297 --> 58:21.033
Annji?

58:25.435 --> 58:27.839
[banging and screaming]

58:35.347 --> 58:37.383
[toilet flushing]

58:51.597 --> 58:54.234
[grunting]

59:40.615 --> 59:42.551
[alarm sounding]

01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:02.469
Scott, come with me.

01:00:02.471 --> 01:00:04.006
No.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.542
You didn't help Kate.

01:00:08.176 --> 01:00:10.847
You locked yourself away
and you hid from us.

01:00:11.581 --> 01:00:14.014
I'm Kate's father,

01:00:14.016 --> 01:00:16.617
and don't you think I've
been spending every second

01:00:16.619 --> 01:00:18.288
trying to find a way
to help her?

01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:21.858
Scott,

01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:25.262
be your best
on your worst day.

01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:27.297
Come on.

01:00:59.596 --> 01:01:01.432
Dad, you've got
to see this.

01:01:01.632 --> 01:01:02.901
Right.

01:01:03.668 --> 01:01:04.668
Dad?

01:01:05.235 --> 01:01:06.235
Dad!

01:01:08.974 --> 01:01:09.572
Stay calm.

01:01:09.574 --> 01:01:11.310
[thud]

01:01:14.478 --> 01:01:15.947
Scott.

01:01:22.521 --> 01:01:24.457
Nick! Nick!

01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:27.160
Are you okay?

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.097
What now?

01:01:33.499 --> 01:01:35.267
Um, well,

01:01:36.434 --> 01:01:39.004
go and see what
the television says now.

01:01:41.106 --> 01:01:42.508
Dad, please.

01:01:43.142 --> 01:01:44.040
Look at the phone.

01:01:44.042 --> 01:01:45.743
There's something
going on out there.

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:46.578
Be quiet.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.480
You've caused enough
trouble already.

01:01:48.482 --> 01:01:50.217
That was an accident.

01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:53.955
But I...
I can't explain it.

01:01:55.455 --> 01:01:58.556
It's not natural.
The house is surrounded by...

01:01:58.558 --> 01:02:00.728
snakes or something.
I don't know.

01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:04.030
What is it?

01:02:06.065 --> 01:02:08.032
What?
You think I'm a bumpkin?

01:02:08.034 --> 01:02:09.034
Is that it?

01:02:09.502 --> 01:02:11.072
No, Dad.

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:17.044
Dad...

01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:18.711
Dad. Da...

01:02:18.713 --> 01:02:20.682
[grunting]

01:02:38.067 --> 01:02:39.402
Well?

01:02:39.835 --> 01:02:41.670
Any new orders?

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:17.307
[muffled grunts]

01:03:38.129 --> 01:03:39.761
Dad, this is insane!

01:03:39.763 --> 01:03:42.634
We have to stop
listening to the TV.

01:03:44.134 --> 01:03:45.067
Dad?

01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:47.739
Well, um, we'll start
at the beginning.

01:03:50.275 --> 01:03:52.344
- Who sent you?
- No one.

01:03:54.378 --> 01:03:55.677
As expected.

01:03:55.679 --> 01:03:57.246
How long have you
been plotting this?

01:03:57.248 --> 01:03:59.749
Stop talking like that,
I'm your son!

01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:01.353
I'm your son!

01:04:01.686 --> 01:04:02.755
Scott?

01:04:03.521 --> 01:04:05.090
Scott!

01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:08.359
Dad...

01:04:11.796 --> 01:04:15.702
Dad... Scott...
Dad, stop, please.

01:04:16.935 --> 01:04:19.271
[screaming in pain]

01:04:21.874 --> 01:04:23.542
Nick!

01:04:23.843 --> 01:04:26.113
[bangs on the door]

01:04:27.212 --> 01:04:28.314
<i>Let me out!</i>

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.613
My own son,
a sleeper agent.

01:04:30.615 --> 01:04:32.816
Was it Annji, Nick?
Did she turn you?

01:04:32.818 --> 01:04:34.286
Look,
I think he's had enough.

01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:35.523
He doesn't know anything!

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:37.692
There's something
else going on.

01:04:38.692 --> 01:04:41.529
Look at the phone.
Just look at the phone.

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:52.572
All of this started
after you came back.

01:04:54.507 --> 01:04:55.639
I don't trust you anymore,
Nick.

01:04:55.641 --> 01:04:56.340
I don't trust you.

01:04:56.342 --> 01:04:57.675
You don't have
to trust me.

01:04:57.677 --> 01:04:59.481
Just watch the clip.

01:05:06.521 --> 01:05:07.622
Don't!

01:05:09.356 --> 01:05:12.258
I won't let any
of this nonsense

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.926
put me off anymore.

01:05:13.928 --> 01:05:16.696
We'll take an eye.
That will make him talk.

01:05:16.698 --> 01:05:18.531
T-Tony are you sure?

01:05:18.533 --> 01:05:19.935
I mean,
that's that's his eye!

01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:22.768
Fuck!

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:24.439
You don't get it,
do you?

01:05:24.906 --> 01:05:27.543
It's a twisted
fucking experiment.

01:05:28.543 --> 01:05:30.480
We've done this to ourselves.

01:05:33.616 --> 01:05:37.317
Don't let them
manipulate you.

01:05:37.319 --> 01:05:40.253
You were always too clever
for your own good.

01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:42.391
[grunting]

01:05:43.659 --> 01:05:45.561
<i>Tony!</i>

01:05:50.432 --> 01:05:51.802
She's dead.

01:05:53.802 --> 01:05:55.836
My Kate is dead.

01:05:55.838 --> 01:05:58.341
No... No!
She's not!

01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:06.783
[crying]

01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:30.941
This changes nothing.

01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:35.648
In... In war there are
always casualties.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.919
You fucking arrogant fool!

01:06:42.921 --> 01:06:44.454
All these years together

01:06:44.456 --> 01:06:47.791
