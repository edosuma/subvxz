01:41.726 --> 01:44.938
I'm Denise.
I'm a survivor of domestic violence.

01:45.021 --> 01:45.980
Hi, Denise.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.148
Hi, Denise.

01:47.232 --> 01:52.320
Does anyone want to share anything today
before we start with our special activity?

01:54.114 --> 01:57.408
Okay. Then I'll turn this over to Alex.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.701
Let's give her a warm welcome.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.122
Thanks, guys.

02:02.205 --> 02:06.626
I'm Alex and I am a survivor
of domestic violence.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.878
Hi, Alex.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.966
I asked Denise
if I could do some volunteer work and...

02:13.550 --> 02:16.094
I meant cleaning the toilets, but...

02:16.177 --> 02:18.138
Denise said that I should do this instead

02:18.221 --> 02:23.351
and I said "no," and she said "yes,"
and here we are.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.645
Show them your serial-killer notebook.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.398
She says my writing looks like
a serial killer's, so...

02:28.481 --> 02:30.191
Damn, you wrote all that?

02:30.275 --> 02:34.320
I did. Yes. I wrote this just
since I've been at McMullen House.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.617
Do any of you guys write for fun?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.914
Brandi, you do not need
to raise your hand.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.711
I had a diary in 5th grade.
It was furry and pink.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.046
It had a little lock on it.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.591
-Yeah. Me too. I had one of those.
-Mm.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.719
Here's the hard question.

02:57.802 --> 03:01.222
Who were you writing to when you wrote?

03:01.306 --> 03:03.850
Nobody. Just myself.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.268
Yeah, same.

03:06.269 --> 03:10.273
Writing is where I go to be honest
about how I feel.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.861
Sometimes it's really the only way for me
to know what it is that I'm feeling.

03:14.944 --> 03:18.364
Like I have to write
in order to see what I'm gonna write.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.241
If that makes any sense.

03:21.075 --> 03:21.910
But...

03:22.911 --> 03:27.498
I find that it's a lot easier to write
the truth than it is to say it out loud.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.628
Nobody can take writing away from you.

03:32.211 --> 03:36.633
Nobody can tell you that you're wrong,
or your words are wrong.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.051
Because they're not.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.845
You're right,
and your words are fucking right.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.932
Because they're yours.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.062
Anyway, we all have notebooks and pens.

03:49.145 --> 03:52.607
Are we gonna read this out loud?

03:52.690 --> 03:56.194
You can if you want to, but you definitely
don't have to if you don't want to.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.948
Okay, so I brought some writing prompts

04:00.031 --> 04:03.534
that I got from a real professor
from the Internet

04:03.618 --> 04:06.412
that is qualified to be teaching things.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.166
Okay. Describe a day in your life
that you were really happy.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.127
It can be a real day
that actually happened.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.422
Or an imagined day
that you wish would happen.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.386
I'm gonna put ten minutes on...

04:22.553 --> 04:23.846
the clock.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.767
There's no pressure, we're just
writing for the sake of writing.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.149
That was great.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.236
-Can I ask something? You have a minute?
-Of course.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.571
I know the answer to this already,

04:40.655 --> 04:43.658
but we're not allowed to have
any visitors at the shelter, are we?

04:43.741 --> 04:46.119
No. I'm sorry, baby girl.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.289
We can only have individual victims
and their children in shelter.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.582
-Figured.
-Why?

04:52.875 --> 04:56.879
Um, I just found out
that my mom's living in a car.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.298
Sorry to hear that.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.590
Thanks.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.134
Is she a victim of DV?

05:02.135 --> 05:06.931
She's a chronic victim of DV,
but she's also in complete denial

05:07.015 --> 05:09.851
and delusional and unmedicated, so...

05:10.601 --> 05:12.562
Is she over 55?

05:12.645 --> 05:13.896
Mm-hm.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.525
They have a program called SHARE that
puts homeless folks at senior centers,

05:17.608 --> 05:19.777
but she has to enroll.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.571
Yeah. Ah...

05:21.654 --> 05:24.782
She really hates
everything government-oriented

05:24.866 --> 05:28.995
and she's on the lam from a psych ward,
so that's not gonna work out.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.330
Thank you.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.291
Is there anyone else that
can look after your mom?

05:34.083 --> 05:37.003
No, I've been taking care of her
since I was 6.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.299
What would happen if you didn't?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.269
I think I'll do something,
I don't know,

05:53.352 --> 05:55.313
something spectacular when I walk in.

06:01.486 --> 06:06.699
They come in really strong.
Yeah, that's a good idea, so...

06:09.160 --> 06:10.578
Oh, shit, man.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.289
-Hey, Mom.
-Alex, hey.

06:13.372 --> 06:18.711
I thought that was you, I was just driving
home from a clean and I saw your car.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.421
She's hard to miss.

06:20.505 --> 06:24.967
-What are you up to out here?
-Oh, well, look at Her Majesty.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.844
Spring has sprung.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.722
It's gonna be a cotton-candy sunset,

06:29.806 --> 06:33.309
and I'm gonna watch
every sugar-coated moment of her.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.020
Looks like you were talking to the birds.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.772
Oh, no, honey.

06:38.397 --> 06:43.903
I downloaded that
dictation app onto my phone.

06:43.986 --> 06:48.825
Because I'm giving a lecture
on the Neolithic concept

06:48.908 --> 06:50.743
of the solar barge to the collective.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.914
And, um,
I would write this one, but I can't.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.833
Because my fucking arm's killing me.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.168
Oh, where's your cast, Mom?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.629
Where did your cast go?

07:01.712 --> 07:03.381
Oh.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.175
It was plastered to your wrist.
Where did it go?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.135
Uh...

07:07.885 --> 07:11.222
I had a terrible itch,
so I had Micah saw it off.

07:11.305 --> 07:14.308
I have to say, it was oddly erotic.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.645
Are you kidding me?
The cast has to be on for six more weeks.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.689
-It's fine.
-No, that's not fine.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.692
You have a severed tendon and now
your tendon is not gonna heal.

07:23.526 --> 07:27.238
If you're gonna ruin
the cotton candy, you're gonna have to go.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.119
I'm, um...

07:34.203 --> 07:35.913
I'm glad that I ran into you.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.543
I know that you have a great
living situation in your loft

07:40.626 --> 07:43.045
with your collective, but, um...

07:44.589 --> 07:47.341
I told you I'm moving to Montana.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.928
What if you came with me?

07:52.889 --> 07:55.141
I've got a place on campus.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.934
You could hang with Maddy

07:57.018 --> 08:01.647
and you could go on walks
and you could paint all day.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.400
Watch Maddy start kindergarten.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.822
Oh, babe, that's not me.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.117
Why not?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.619
Because I'm not boring.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.873
I've got a big life.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.751
I can't be galloping off behind you,
being a tag along.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.004
No, Mom. I'm really serious.
I'm inviting you.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.424
My blood's here, honey.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.344
My mama's buried here.
Her mama's buried here.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.262
The Langley women are here.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.184
I am a Langley woman and I am going.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.603
I know, baby, and that's you.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.313
But, uh...

08:44.857 --> 08:46.067
I can't leave.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.363
Okay.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.368
Go to some appointments before I leave.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.204
-Like the wrist doctor.
-Hard pass.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.123
I'm making you an appointment
for tomorrow, okay?

09:01.207 --> 09:04.085
You're gonna meet me there.
Nod that you hear me.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.175
I don't wanna have to worry
about you when I'm gone, Mom.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.766
Look at that. Cotton candy.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.605
We're starting here, and then
we're gonna go over some mountains.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.484
We're gonna go to Spokane,
which is a really big city.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.028
Then we're gonna go over more mountains.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.531
Then over some more mountains.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.492
All the way to Missoula.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.995
-Mm-hm.
-Right there.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.621
Missoula.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.539
Missoula.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.668
It's gonna take us this many hours.

09:45.751 --> 09:51.757
Two. Three. Four. Five.
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.675
Nine hours.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.053
-And "Shoop."
-Exactly.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.382
No!

10:59.033 --> 11:05.539
Hi, I'd like to place an order
for English 102, Block 5, textbook.

11:08.876 --> 11:09.877
For books?

11:11.295 --> 11:13.547
Do you have any used copies?

11:16.759 --> 11:19.804
Great, um, would you mind
setting one of those aside?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.472
I can be there on Tuesday.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.934
Thank you.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.689
-Hey, Tara.
-Oh, good, hi.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.234
Just a quick update for you.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.236
I just got back from the clerk's office.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.862
-Uh-oh.
-No, it's fine.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.573
They objected to the notice of relocation,
which we knew,

11:39.657 --> 11:43.411
but the motion for the ex parte
emergency custody order

11:43.494 --> 11:46.956
has been filed and I also slapped him with
a temporary no-contact order,

11:47.039 --> 11:49.208
so that ought to make a point.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.377
-So he can't contact me?
-Correct.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.380
The sheriff should be serving him
with the restraining order

11:54.463 --> 11:56.674
and the ex parte motion this morning.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.342
Okay. Uh...

11:58.426 --> 12:01.011
-So, what happens now?
-We wait.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.889
I left word for Sean's attorney.
We should know more soon.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.100
Okay, thank you so much.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.560
Yeah, no problem, bye.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.397
Brandi, I think you were next, right?

12:13.190 --> 12:16.569
I don't know if this
is my happiest day ever,

12:16.652 --> 12:18.612
but it's what came to my mind during then.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.947
Perfect.

12:21.657 --> 12:25.077
"I used to go on these walks
with my dad as a kid.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.956
We'd go in June before
the sticky late-summer heat.

12:30.791 --> 12:35.337
I'd get one of those Flintstone
orange popsicles from 7-Eleven.

12:36.338 --> 12:39.467
The kind you have to use
all your might to push up.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.971
We'd walk along the ocean
looking at the Virgo constellations,

12:44.054 --> 12:47.433
since my birthday is four days before his.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.644
My dad would point to the sky and tell me

12:50.728 --> 12:54.231
he was the Big Dipper
and I was the Little Dipper.

12:55.065 --> 13:00.446
We stopped
going on our walks when my dad got sick.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.825
But I went back recently with my son.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.413
Got him a Flintstone orange popsicle.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.710
They're much easier to push up now.

13:16.420 --> 13:20.466
I looked up at the night sky,
and there it was...

13:21.258 --> 13:23.594
as if zero time had passed.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.430
The Big and Little Dipper."

13:34.021 --> 13:34.939
That's it.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.989
So of course we wanna keep
everything that we say positive,

13:44.073 --> 13:48.827
but I was hoping that
we could say some of the images

13:48.911 --> 13:53.666
that are gonna stay with us
from Brandi's story.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.876
"Sticky late-summer heat."

13:57.503 --> 13:59.255
"They're much easier to push up now."

14:02.424 --> 14:03.968
"Zero time had passed."

14:05.511 --> 14:07.179
"Big and Little Dipper."

14:08.681 --> 14:10.975
Does anybody else wanna share?

14:26.323 --> 14:28.617
Please leave a message after the tone.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.393
Mom.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.311
Mom!

14:55.895 --> 14:57.062
Hey, honey.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.231
Don't. We're going to the doctor.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.859
-What doctor?
-The doctor that you just stood up.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.403
She can see you at00,
but we have to leave right now.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.447
It's Thursday. I didn't say I was going.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.991
We have the booth on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.784
And I'm not abandoning Micah.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.871
-Come meet my daughter.
-We met the other day.

15:13.954 --> 15:14.788
Oh.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.041
Mom. Please, can we go?

15:17.124 --> 15:20.920
Uh, why have you got glitter all over?
Did you go to a rave?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.422
-I cleaned a playroom.
-You know what glitter is?

15:23.505 --> 15:26.842
-It is the lice of the art room.
-You gave me your word. Come on.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.511
-You spread it wherever you go.
-Would you grow up?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.388
-We gotta go.
-You're the one with glitter.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.099
Get in my car and I'm gonna
drive you to the doctor.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.560
You're not the boss of me. Okay?

15:36.644 --> 15:38.062
It's my arm that hurts.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.982
I'll take CBD or go to the doctor
or I'll cut the fucker off.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.610
Just because you're on some timer
because you're leaving,

15:44.693 --> 15:46.737
doesn't mean I am. I am fantastic.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.531
For God's sake,
just worry about somebody else. Please.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.367
-Babe.
-Oh, sorry, honey.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.161
I'm working. I've got a job here, okay?

15:54.828 --> 15:55.788
Hi there.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.376
You got a nice smile. Look at your smile.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.878
-Tara?
-Uh, change of plans.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.506
Do you think you could meet me
near my office on Whitby?

16:05.589 --> 16:06.840
Is everything okay?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.677
I spoke to Sean's attorney.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.097
They are moving to reject
the ex parte motion altogether,

16:13.180 --> 16:15.140
citing lack of evidence of abuse.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.394
And Sean is unwilling
to revise the parenting plan

16:18.477 --> 16:20.813
or give up any of his custodial rights.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.566
Okay.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.776
Thanks.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.779
I'm sorry. So, what does that mean?

16:28.862 --> 16:31.657
It means that he says you're lying
about being abused.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.827
So there will be
an adequate-cause hearing in 14 days

16:34.910 --> 16:38.038
to determine the validity
of your claims and appropriate custody.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.959
And it's gonna be
what we call a win-loss case.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.713
If you lose,
you can't take Maddy anywhere.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.049
Uh, ever?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.552
Washington makes it very hard
for victims of DV.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.303
Particularly in cases of emotional--

16:53.387 --> 16:56.890
I'm aware, I've been through this and lost
because I didn't have any bruises.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.559
You're not gonna lose.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.936
We have 14 days to make a solid case.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.731
Someone must have seen this guy
emotionally abuse you.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.233
I don't have 14 days.
I leave for Montana on Monday.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.028
Legally, you can't go anywhere with Maddy.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.487
Not before the hearing.

17:14.783 --> 17:20.289
I am gonna lose my family housing
and my spot in school. I'm...

17:20.372 --> 17:22.541
-Yes.
-Another one.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.003
I have to leave the shelter this weekend.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.631
What do you think that I should do?
I don't have a backup plan here.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.133
We're gonna fight this.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.844
I'm gonna get you there by fall semester.

17:33.927 --> 17:37.556
I just took out a $9000 student loan,
$9000.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.184
I don't know if you realize,
but this is my fucking life.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.686
I'm not rich like you and Regina.
I can't repay this.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.896
There's more.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.565
Sean is demanding visitation with Maddy.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.070
No. We have a restraining order, so, no.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.030
It only applies to you, not to Maddy.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.783
The court has approved
a four-hour visitation.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.660
When?

17:58.744 --> 17:59.578
Tomorrow.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.290
They will appoint a third party,
neutral supervisor,

18:03.373 --> 18:05.626
unless you have someone you could use?

18:05.709 --> 18:07.211
-A grandparent?
-Not doing that.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.670
I can't do that to her.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.924
If you don't comply, you will be
in violation of your parenting plan,

18:12.007 --> 18:16.345
which will not look good
for the hearing in 14 days.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.722
Alex, I'm sorry that
this is happening, but...

18:20.099 --> 18:21.183
it's not over.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.643
It's just a speed bump.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.233
-Oh.
-It's just me.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.027
Alex. Shit. Good God.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.532
You scared the shit out of me.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.242
What are you doing here?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.078
I need your help.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.413
What are you doing here?

19:24.496 --> 19:30.085
Oh, I had one too many margaritas
and I just pulled over here to...

19:31.253 --> 19:33.172
sleep it off on the way home.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.884
-Mom.
-I know this doesn't look good.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.885
It's just, um...

19:39.011 --> 19:43.098
the collective gets noisy
and I come here...

19:43.932 --> 19:44.850
to nap.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.687
I know you sleep here,
you spend all day in the park alone,

19:48.770 --> 19:50.689
and that there's no collective.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.321
Well...

20:00.240 --> 20:03.035
maybe "collective" isn't the right word.

20:04.828 --> 20:10.334
You know, we've really got
a nice group of people here.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.460
Honestly...

20:12.085 --> 20:15.422
We've got the Flores family over here,
in the van.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.966
Billy and Anna. I just love them.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.845
You know, we look out for each other
and it's like a--

20:21.929 --> 20:26.350
I don't know, a big sleep-out
or a drive-in movie theater.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.935
We just need popcorn.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.271
Why can't you take care of yourself?

20:32.022 --> 20:35.359
What do you mean?
You know, I've got my cooler in here.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.819
I've got my vitamins, baby.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.197
Cozy blanket and my fucking good weed.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.074
-I'm fine.
-You're homeless.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.700
You're living in your car.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.036
-Would you just stop?
-No. Please.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.622
I love my car!

20:49.456 --> 20:51.375
She's my cobalt bitch.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.460
-We're like family.
-You're homeless, mom.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.588
-Would you please just stop!
-You're homeless.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.882
I'm under the stars. I'm independent.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.679
And it's not all the time. I mean...

21:04.221 --> 21:06.265
sometimes I stay with Micah.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.309
When Alaina-May's not there.

21:09.393 --> 21:13.981
-Who the fuck is Alaina-May?
-I told you. His wife.

21:14.064 --> 21:19.820
They broke up, but she still stays there
because she's a feral dumpster fire.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.822
The point is, honey, I...

21:23.240 --> 21:28.370
You know, I like being a gypsy.
I like being mobile. Okay?

21:28.453 --> 21:29.955
You know me. I'm scrappy.

21:30.038 --> 21:33.917
I don't know. I can't afford to put you
in a motel or bring you to the shelter.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.168
I don't know.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.838
I am not your problem, Alexandra.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.257
-Yes, you are.
-No, I am not.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.092
-I'm your mother.
-You're not.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.260
Yes, I am!

21:44.219 --> 21:45.721
I am!

21:45.804 --> 21:48.849
You said you needed my help.

21:48.932 --> 21:49.766
I do.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.893
So how can I help you, madam?

21:52.602 --> 21:54.980
Can you supervise a playdate
between Sean and Maddy?

21:55.063 --> 21:58.150
He gets visitation
and a third party needs to be present.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.526
Can you do that?

21:59.609 --> 22:01.278
Yes, I can.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.240
-At what time should I be there?
-30.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.783
Don't you worry.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.202
I will take care of your girl.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.792
-You're going to the doctor.
-Over my dead body.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.753
You're going. Everything isn't all right.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.214
Everything is fucking shit
and you need to be a goddamn adult.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.675
Your hand looks terrible. You're going!

22:26.261 --> 22:27.888
Do I get a lollipop?

22:38.356 --> 22:40.776
Jesus Christ!

22:41.443 --> 22:43.820
What's that smell coming from your car?

22:43.904 --> 22:46.490
-It smells like burnt turds.
-You went to the doctor.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.284
Yeah, look. My finger still works.

22:49.367 --> 22:50.452
Hey, pumpkin pie.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.538
You ready for a playdate
with me and your daddy?

22:54.247 --> 22:55.457
We're gonna have fun.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.835
I've packed a snack and a change
of clothes and she's had lunch already.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.546
We've got this. Hi, pumpkin.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.675
Oh, I know.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.637
I guess I'll wait here, because I have to.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.099
Okay, Maddy. So you're gonna be
with Dad for four hours.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.184
Thanks for sending the cops!

23:14.267 --> 23:15.227
Very classy!

23:15.811 --> 23:16.645
And then...

23:17.521 --> 23:21.108
we'll go and get an
ice cream together. Does that sound good?

23:21.191 --> 23:23.318
Do you want to get ice cream? Okay.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.405
-I love you so much.
-Oh!

23:28.073 --> 23:30.575
-Thanks, Mom.
-Yeah, we're gonna have fun.

23:34.746 --> 23:39.209
Get your Mad-dog.
You're about to see your daddy.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.127
Hey!

23:40.210 --> 23:44.131
Sean-y, you've got your Mad-dog girl here.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.174
-Oh!
-Hey, Sean-y boy.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.552
-She's heavy.
-You're getting big.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.137
She's getting so big.

23:51.596 --> 23:55.016
We've been swinging
and she can go so high.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.059
Mad-dog!

24:02.023 --> 24:03.316
Thank you for coming.

24:03.942 --> 24:04.776
Of course.

24:06.236 --> 24:10.365
I was worried about you falling
off the face of the earth like you did.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.034
You look okay.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.204
I am okay.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.542
Good. Where's Maddy?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.752
I thought maybe I'd get to see her.

24:24.838 --> 24:29.259
She is at the domestic violence shelter
where I'm living.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.637
They have a daycare
for their victims, so...

24:32.721 --> 24:33.930
Oh, okay.

24:34.014 --> 24:38.018
Well, did you, um--?
Did you order anything yet?

24:40.520 --> 24:44.524
This is my second time at an emergency
shelter for abused women this year.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.031
It's the second time
that Sean sent me there.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.499
Do you hear the words
coming out of my mouth?

25:02.125 --> 25:03.460
Yes, I hear them.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.589
And?

25:10.967 --> 25:13.386
I wish you would have reached out to me.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.307
Before taking my granddaughter
to a place like that.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.184
You guys have a place to live.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.104
I would do anything to help,
you know that.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.191
I'd give you the shirt off my back,
all right?

25:26.274 --> 25:27.692
But instead you make me worry.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.612
You make Sean worry.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.866
I've been searching
the ferry station floor

25:34.950 --> 25:36.117
for you guys, Alex.

25:36.952 --> 25:37.786
Okay.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.580
Maybe you can help me now.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.084
Because I do. I need your help.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.169
Okay.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.591
I filed for full custody of Maddy

25:51.675 --> 25:53.885
so that I can take her
to Missoula with me.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.929
And Sean is objecting to it.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.806
Yeah, I know.

25:58.765 --> 25:59.849
Sean told me.

26:00.767 --> 26:01.601
You know...

26:02.811 --> 26:04.938
Sean's not doing too good right now.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.815
I don't care how Sean's doing, Dad.

26:07.607 --> 26:12.070
My lawyer is building a case to prove
that Sean emotionally abused me.

26:13.822 --> 26:18.451
And I have to provide evidence,
testimony from people that have seen it.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.163
Dad...

26:23.999 --> 26:27.210
will you testify that you saw Sean
emotionally abuse me?

26:28.920 --> 26:31.006
-When would I have seen that?
-At the trailer.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.551
-No. That's not what I saw.
-I saw you see it.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.846
-No, Alex, that's not what I saw.
-You sat there and didn't do a thing.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.849
If I saw anything,
what I saw was a young couple

26:40.932 --> 26:42.684
going through a rough patch.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.688
Sean is struggling
with his sobriety right now,

26:46.771 --> 26:49.190
and what he needs is empathy.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.444
You're walking away from him
at the exact wrong moment.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.571
I can't be responsible
for Sean any more, Dad.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.534
I have to do what's best for me,
and I have to do what's best for Maddy.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.786
He's an alcoholic.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.247
Okay? He's--

27:04.748 --> 27:08.877
He's got a disease
that turns him into a monster.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.047
It's the booze that's the enemy, not him.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.090
Okay, is it the booze that hit Mom, then?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.055
-Okay.
-Don't walk out.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.556
Are you fucking kidding me? No!

27:21.639 --> 27:23.600
Alex, what do you want me to say?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.185
I want you to say, "Yes."

27:25.268 --> 27:28.355
I want you to say,
"Yes, I did hit Mom. I'm sorry."

27:29.898 --> 27:31.316
I don't remember that.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.739
You've never been here for me
once in my entire life.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.202
But I'm asking for you to be, right now.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.712
I'm always there for you.
For you and Maddy.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.755
It's just it's...

27:54.923 --> 27:56.132
Then do this for me.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.510
Stand up for me.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.471
Help me protect Maddy.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.851
Write a testimonial.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.569
I can't do that.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.672
Then I guess we don't have much
to say to each other.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.093
Can you just--?

28:47.100 --> 28:52.105
"My happiest day is the day
my daughter touched me for the first time.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.941
I remember it like it was yesterday.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.235
She was nine weeks old.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.863
She didn't know I was in hell,

28:59.946 --> 29:02.949
terrorized day and night by her father.

29:04.200 --> 29:08.496
To her, I was just the warm,
nice milk lady.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.042
But this one morning,
when she was nine weeks old,

29:13.543 --> 29:17.172
we were napping on the floor and I woke up

29:17.255 --> 29:19.257
because someone was touching me.

29:19.799 --> 29:20.967
It was her.

29:22.260 --> 29:26.389
This tiny baby hand
was holding onto my arm.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.975
She was looking at me,

29:29.726 --> 29:33.396
expressing unfiltered affection for me.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.733
This look of trust on her face...

29:38.359 --> 29:41.946
she saw me and loved me.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.910
It was the happiest moment of my life.

29:47.952 --> 29:51.456
That I could be that for someone."

30:10.558 --> 30:11.726
Thank you, Denise.

30:13.186 --> 30:16.189
You guys want to say
what images stood out to you?

30:16.731 --> 30:18.107
"Unfiltered affection."

30:18.817 --> 30:20.860
"Warm, nice milk lady."

30:23.571 --> 30:25.281
"Terrorized day and night."

30:30.286 --> 30:31.788
"Tiny hands."

30:35.875 --> 30:38.002
Does anybody else want to share?

30:41.005 --> 30:41.840
Trina.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.968
Mine's about a girl's night out.
Is that weird?

30:45.051 --> 30:47.303
-It's-- No.

30:47.387 --> 30:50.223
I didn't write about my kids
like you guys did.

30:50.306 --> 30:53.059
It's your happy day.
You can write about whatever you want.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.519
Okay.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.941
"I was at the bar
with my usual wrecking crew.

31:01.901 --> 31:04.070
Liv, Amanda and Davina.

31:04.153 --> 31:07.407
We were slamming drinks,
celebrating something,

31:07.490 --> 31:08.950
I can't remember what.

31:10.201 --> 31:14.122
But I'll admit it, I wasn't mad about
how I was looking that night.

31:14.998 --> 31:19.586
Then this incredibly hot man
came up from behind. His--"

31:19.669 --> 31:21.921
I'm sorry, I just have
to step out for a second.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
-Keep reading. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.135
"His name was Neil.
He was dressed very nice..."

31:27.218 --> 31:29.888
It's okay. It's okay.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.931
Are you okay? What's going on?

31:32.015 --> 31:34.392
She just got a little upset, that's all.

31:34.475 --> 31:38.313
She had a little meltdown
and couldn't recover.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.939
Isn't that right, pumpkin?

31:40.023 --> 31:42.275
She just really wanted her mommy.

31:43.276 --> 31:48.281
Um, Alex, Sean-y dropped us off,
and he wants to talk to you.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.495
I'm in the middle of class.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.332
Honey, you need to go talk to him.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.125
Things did not go well.

32:04.714 --> 32:05.548
What happened?

32:06.966 --> 32:10.470
When I told her to get off the swing,
she had a tantrum. She was screaming.

32:12.889 --> 32:16.559
-She never wants to get off the swings.
-I know, but I fucking couldn't handle it.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.938
I-- I lost my temper, and I yelled at her.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.490
I haven't had a drink in 24 hours.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.826
I was trying to be straight
for Maddy, and, uh...

32:37.997 --> 32:39.332
I'm irritable.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.085
My skin fucking crawls.

32:43.419 --> 32:44.587
The sun hurts.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.547
I'm just rubbed raw.

32:49.717 --> 32:53.638
I was pushing Maddy on the swings.
She kept saying, "Higher, Daddy, higher."

32:56.015 --> 32:57.225
And it was nice.

32:58.768 --> 32:59.978
She was giggling.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.524
But even then, I was still planning
my next fucking drink.

33:04.607 --> 33:08.194
I was trying to find some... relief.

33:08.903 --> 33:12.615
And she had the tantrum,
and I knew that if Paula wasn't there,

33:12.699 --> 33:15.201
I'd have found a drink with Maddy in tow.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.415
Just like my fucking mom.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.089
I don't wanna do that to Maddy.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.971
I'm signing over full custody to you.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.641
I just called my lawyer.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.568
Sorry I'm such a piece of shit.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.239
You're doing right by her.

33:56.576 --> 34:00.246
You can come whenever you want,
and get her stuff. I'll box it up for you.

34:04.042 --> 34:04.959
Thanks.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.475
Do I have the DTs, or are you sparkly?

34:24.729 --> 34:25.688
I'm sparkly.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.215
Nice. Thanks for sharing.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.305
That was so awesome.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.183
"Fuck Murphy's Law." I like that line.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.687
"Punched him like a boxer."
That stood out to me.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.356
"The cracked nightlight."

35:09.357 --> 35:10.983
Black, not blue.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.902
I just loved the whole thing.

35:12.985 --> 35:15.363
You're a great writer, Edith.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.031
-Esther.
-Oh. Yeah.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.450
Well, I'm next, right?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.369
Mom, you didn't write anything.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.954
Well, I can recite it.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.706
I'm a great-- I'm just great at oration.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.707
Mother.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.335
Aww...

35:29.961 --> 35:31.629
Oh, well. Okay.

35:33.714 --> 35:36.509
-Will you wait outside? I'm almost done.
-Okay.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.137
-Bye, ladies.
-Bye.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.181
-Peace out.
-You're welcome back any time, Paula.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.766
Oh, thank you so much.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.311
Yeah.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.731
Oh, man.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.151
Here's to getting out of Dodge.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.072
My man Sean-y looked like shit.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.869
Your dad shook a lot like that.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.875
Do you want to tell me your happiest day?

36:10.960 --> 36:11.794
What?

36:12.753 --> 36:14.255
The thing we were doing in group.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.800
You have a day
you remember where you were happy?

36:18.759 --> 36:19.760
Oh.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.766
Hands down, our first morning in Alaska.

36:27.226 --> 36:29.437
We got into Anchorage
in the middle of the night,

36:29.520 --> 36:33.566
and you were freezing
because I forgot your coat.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.737
We left your dad's in such a panic.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.118
I had this cabin for us,
and it didn't have any furniture.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.078
So, uh...

36:47.079 --> 36:50.333
I just dumped all the clothes
from the suitcase

36:50.416 --> 36:53.377
in the middle of the floor
and made us a bed.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.672
And we slept there, snuggled up.

36:59.342 --> 37:02.762
The next morning,
while you were still sleeping,

37:02.845 --> 37:04.722
I tiptoed outside,

37:04.805 --> 37:07.016
and I just dove into the snow.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.393
And I lay there,

37:10.269 --> 37:13.147
and made a snow angel.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.275
Because nobody was there
to tell me I was crazy

37:17.360 --> 37:19.195
or suddenly explode on me.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.656
It was just me...

37:23.199 --> 37:24.784
the sun and the snow.

37:29.664 --> 37:33.000
Anyway, in less than a year,
we were back here,

37:33.084 --> 37:35.419
and I was broke as shit.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.172
The whole trip was just dumb.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.174
No, it wasn't.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.550
It wasn't dumb.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.012
You got me away from Dad,
and you never went back to him.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.530
Uh...

38:03.864 --> 38:04.740
So, uh...

38:09.453 --> 38:11.539
So am I still invited to Montana?

38:13.249 --> 38:14.292
You want to come?

38:15.918 --> 38:16.794
Yeah.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.507
Hell yeah, why not?

38:22.133 --> 38:25.970
I can get a job painting murals,

38:26.595 --> 38:28.514
find me a mountain man.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.934
Plus, Maddy needs me.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.853
She's an artist like me.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.980
Can you be ready by Monday?

38:36.814 --> 38:38.941
I'm ready.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.526
I'm packed, baby.

38:40.609 --> 38:43.404
That's the nice thing about living
in your car, you're packed.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.740
I don't know if she's going
to make it to Montana,

38:45.823 --> 38:48.075
I might have to sell her for parts...

38:49.952 --> 38:52.330
but I could hitch a ride with you, yeah?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.248
Yeah.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.833
-Yeah?
-Yes.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.501
-Really?
-Of course.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.462
Oh, my gosh. Yes?

39:00.504 --> 39:01.464
Maddy!

39:01.547 --> 39:03.215
Maddy girl, guess what.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.301
We're going on a road trip!

39:05.801 --> 39:08.220
Do you want to go
on a road trip with Grammy?

39:08.804 --> 39:10.556
We're going to go on a road trip!

39:10.639 --> 39:14.310
Oh, my goodness,
we're going to go on a road trip!

40:25.172 --> 40:26.632
-Is that it?
-That's it.

40:38.894 --> 40:41.021
You can come see her as much as you want.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.900
Yeah, I'm going to get myself cleaned up.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.115
And then I'll come visit all the time.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.418
I'm really going to miss her.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.650
Good luck, Alaska.

42:01.227 --> 42:04.104
-Save the black ones.
-Yes...

42:04.188 --> 42:06.649
Yeah, and black ones are nice.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.275
Come on, Maddy.

42:35.469 --> 42:36.303
This way.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.052
All right, honey...

43:18.929 --> 43:20.055
I'll be right back.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.066
I didn't know you were coming by.
Come on in.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.901
I can't, I've got Maddy back there.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.904
I just wanted to come say goodbye.

43:36.488 --> 43:38.699
I also have been meaning to give you this.

43:38.782 --> 43:43.162
I'm not sure if I stole it
or what happened, but I had it, so...

43:44.246 --> 43:46.915
I saw you had it on. Thanksgiving, right?

43:46.999 --> 43:48.125
I'm really sorry.

43:48.208 --> 43:50.794
Nah, can't blame a girl
for putting on a little cashmere.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.758
-So next stop Montana?
-I'm, uh...

43:56.800 --> 44:00.304
going to pick my mom up
in Port Winslow and get on the I-90.

44:02.514 --> 44:05.976
-Thank you for being such a good friend.
-You too.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.192
-Keep the sweater.
-No, no, I'm going to buy my own one day.

44:13.734 --> 44:15.569
It was $1400.

44:16.612 --> 44:17.529
I'm keeping it.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.782
-Mother?
-Oh!

45:02.408 --> 45:03.992
Hi. Hi, hi.

45:04.576 --> 45:05.452
Oh!

45:07.871 --> 45:10.332
Oh, honey, you must be so excited.

45:11.250 --> 45:14.962
-You said you were going to sell your car.
-I was. I mean...

45:15.045 --> 45:17.214
I am. But, baby, honey,

45:17.297 --> 45:21.093
I just have the most incredible news.

45:23.971 --> 45:24.930
What?

45:25.013 --> 45:28.016
Micah threw Alaina-May out.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.811
He threw that feral bitch
to the curb for me.

45:30.894 --> 45:34.231
And I slept in his bed
last night, in his arms.

45:34.314 --> 45:37.025
And I'm telling you, honey,
there's sex and then there's...

45:37.109 --> 45:39.736
Oh, my God, this was on a whole new level.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.405
Even for me.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.284
Are you not coming?

45:45.909 --> 45:48.662
Sweetie, you know, just not right now.

45:48.745 --> 45:51.540
I mean, I-- I can't leave Micah right now,

45:51.623 --> 45:53.959
I mean, what's going on
between us, you know, baby,

45:54.042 --> 45:56.253
it's just so powerful and...

45:57.296 --> 45:58.172
It's just really...

46:00.048 --> 46:01.717
I can't wait on you, Mom.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.428
No, you're not.
Of course you're not going to wait on me.

46:04.511 --> 46:05.721
This is your moment.

46:05.804 --> 46:10.350
You go, baby doll, and I'll tell you what,
give me the address,

46:10.434 --> 46:13.061
and I'll be right behind.

46:13.145 --> 46:15.189
I just-- I'll follow you, okay?

46:16.273 --> 46:19.151
-I don't want to leave you here.
-I know.

46:19.234 --> 46:21.111
Isn't it funny how these things work out?

46:21.195 --> 46:24.198
I mean, as soon as I told Micah
I was leaving,

46:24.281 --> 46:26.366
he realized he had feelings for me.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.202
I mean, baby, it was, "Boom!"

46:28.285 --> 46:31.497
And he told Alaina-May
about me and everything.

46:33.123 --> 46:33.999
Just...

46:34.833 --> 46:36.126
be happy for me.

46:40.506 --> 46:41.673
I'm gonna go without you.

46:41.757 --> 46:44.218
Yes, you're going to go.
Of course you're going to go.

46:46.929 --> 46:49.848
Sweetheart, this is your adventure.
It's not mine.

46:54.895 --> 46:56.188
You going to be okay?

46:58.440 --> 47:01.109
-Come on, you know you love me.
-I do love you.

47:01.193 --> 47:04.655
-I know you do. Give me a really good hug.
-Okay.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.324
Oh, God.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.742
Oh, sweetie.

47:08.825 --> 47:11.119
-I love you, Mom.
-Yeah, I know, baby.

48:10.053 --> 48:13.098
Do you guys want to do
a round of snaps for everybody?

48:21.398 --> 48:24.276
I just want to thank you guys
so much for doing this with me.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.236
It's been a real honor.

48:27.779 --> 48:29.031
Thank you.

48:29.114 --> 48:30.616
Thank you, Alex.

48:30.699 --> 48:33.410
Wait, we didn't hear your happiest day.

48:39.666 --> 48:42.294
"My happiest day hasn't happened yet.

48:43.629 --> 48:45.297
But it's about to.

48:47.841 --> 48:52.137
On that day, I'm going to get in my car

48:52.220 --> 48:54.389
that smells like old tuna...

48:55.349 --> 48:58.060
which will be packed
with all of my belongings

48:58.143 --> 49:00.312
and my amazing daughter.

49:00.979 --> 49:04.983
And I'm going to drive
the fuck out of this town.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.611
I'm going to drive nine hours,

49:08.612 --> 49:13.825
566 miles to Missoula, Montana...

49:15.202 --> 49:18.497
where I'm going to spend
the next four years...

49:19.289 --> 49:21.041
learning to be a writer.

49:22.417 --> 49:26.505
Hopefully, there will be a lot
of happy days during that time.

49:28.173 --> 49:30.759
And I know there will be some hard ones.

49:33.637 --> 49:37.933
Most people would bet against a single mom
putting herself through college.

49:40.185 --> 49:42.396
But they don't know
what it took to get here.

49:45.357 --> 49:48.402
Three hundred and thirty-eight
toilets cleaned...

49:50.987 --> 49:53.407
seven types of government assistance...

49:55.075 --> 49:57.035
nine separate moves...

49:58.995 --> 50:01.331
one night on the ferry-station floor...

50:02.708 --> 50:06.837
and the entire third year
of my daughter's life.

50:09.005 --> 50:11.299
But, when we get to Missoula...

50:12.551 --> 50:14.845
I'm going to take Maddy
up Sentinel Mountain...

50:16.054 --> 50:19.516
which looks over the town,
and show her our new home.

50:23.478 --> 50:25.981
I've been telling her
all about the giant M

50:26.064 --> 50:27.899
that's at the tippy-top of the mountain.

50:33.989 --> 50:37.743
That the trail up there
is long and zig-zaggy.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.247
The hike will be hard.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.877
But we're going to make it to the top.

50:49.254 --> 50:50.589
And when we do...

50:52.799 --> 50:55.927
I'm going to tell her
that the M stands for 'Maddy.'

50:59.097 --> 51:01.558
That this whole new world is for her."

51:08.231 --> 51:13.487
Whoo!
