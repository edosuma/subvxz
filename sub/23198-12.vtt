02:10.443 --> 02:12.878
I want you all to pay
very close attention now...

02:12.946 --> 02:15.379
because I'm going to tie a bowline knot.

02:15.448 --> 02:19.407
First, you form a loop like that,
then you take this end of the rope...

02:19.485 --> 02:22.511
through the hole, over the top,
and back through.

02:22.588 --> 02:26.887
And you cinch it up real tight
and it forms a knot that won't slip.

02:26.991 --> 02:29.789
You can make a loop
and tie it with a bowline...

02:29.861 --> 02:31.590
and it will hold real tight.

02:31.663 --> 02:35.393
It's good for fires, mountain climbing,
and water accidents.

02:35.666 --> 02:38.499
- You want to give it a try, Charlie?
- I want to.

02:44.740 --> 02:45.900
Babette.

02:47.944 --> 02:51.072
Dad, rustlers. They hit us again.

02:51.814 --> 02:53.281
How many head this time?

02:53.349 --> 02:56.215
Rocky's still counting, but he figures
at least a hundred head.

02:56.284 --> 02:57.683
That does it.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.348
Sheriff Bodie here. It's your nickel.

03:05.426 --> 03:07.553
Hansen, this is J.P.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.697
I lost another
hundred head of cattle last night.

03:10.764 --> 03:12.322
I'll come right over, J.P.

03:12.566 --> 03:14.795
We'll find out who's doing this. I promise.

03:14.868 --> 03:16.597
Listen, I'm tired of promises.

03:17.570 --> 03:19.094
What are you going to do?

03:19.172 --> 03:22.663
Inasmuch as every side of beef here
is earmarked for the military...

03:22.741 --> 03:26.802
I'll call an old friend in Washington and
get some high-powered help down here.

03:26.879 --> 03:29.370
We don't need no outsiders coming in, J.P.

03:29.448 --> 03:33.349
- It's our job to catch these rustlers.
- You sure could have fooled me.

03:36.153 --> 03:37.381
What's going on, Sheriff?

03:37.455 --> 03:40.322
Diamond H lost
another hundred head of cattle last night.

03:40.391 --> 03:42.756
J.P. Says he's calling Washington
for some help.

03:42.826 --> 03:45.260
Wait on. It's our job
to catch them cattle rustlers.

03:45.328 --> 03:47.319
That's what we're getting paid for.

03:47.397 --> 03:48.887
I guess I can't blame J.P.

03:48.965 --> 03:51.831
They keep hitting his herd,
and we can't get near them.

03:51.901 --> 03:54.267
I don't like being made a fool of...

03:54.336 --> 03:57.032
by J.P. Bringing in some outsiders
to do our job.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.097
Can't feel any worse about it than I do.

03:59.208 --> 04:03.337
I think we should go over to the ranch
and talk the old man out of doing that.

04:08.850 --> 04:13.013
I've been hoping you'd get down this way
so I could introduce my growing family.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.351
Growing family? When did you remarry?

04:16.490 --> 04:17.649
I didn't.

04:17.824 --> 04:21.623
The family consists of my son Jeff
plus five war orphans.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.657
We're now represented
by the Navajo Nation...

04:25.197 --> 04:28.223
Harlem, Paris, London, and Shanghai.

04:28.301 --> 04:31.861
I'd love to meet your
junior League of Nations, old friend...

04:32.103 --> 04:34.264
but I'm afraid this war takes top priority.

04:34.339 --> 04:37.035
Me and my fellow ranchers
have government contracts...

04:37.108 --> 04:39.075
to produce all the beef we can raise.

04:39.143 --> 04:42.237
Our problem is rustlers.
They're stealing us blind.

04:42.613 --> 04:46.743
Unless the thieves are stopped in a hurry,
we won't have any beef to deliver...

04:46.817 --> 04:49.808
not to the Army, Navy,
Air Corps or Marines.

04:50.219 --> 04:52.414
Signs of the times, I guess.

04:52.689 --> 04:55.089
All that beef winds up
on the black market.

04:55.458 --> 04:58.017
With meat rationing in effect,
it's big business.

04:58.093 --> 05:01.062
We'll be out of business
unless we can get some help here.

05:01.129 --> 05:02.289
What kind of help?

05:02.364 --> 05:04.662
Manpower, some real good manpower.

05:05.667 --> 05:09.102
Good men are at a premium
even here in Washington.

05:10.371 --> 05:14.330
Phil, I ran an awful lot of interference
for you on the football field.

05:14.775 --> 05:16.640
How about running some for me now?

05:16.711 --> 05:19.042
They say an army marches on its stomach.

05:19.112 --> 05:22.343
I guess that puts me directly
in the beef business.

05:22.616 --> 05:25.380
I'll send you the man
in charge of my intelligence team:

05:25.452 --> 05:26.850
Maj. Steve Trevor.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.280
That's great. When can I expect him?

05:29.355 --> 05:30.788
First thing tomorrow morning.

05:30.856 --> 05:32.949
Much obliged, Phil. AdiÃ³s.

05:35.227 --> 05:38.354
He's sending the very best:
Maj. Steve Trevor.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.730
- The war hero?
- That's right.

05:40.999 --> 05:44.332
Maj. Trevor now heads up
Gen. Blankenship's intelligence team.

05:45.269 --> 05:48.726
I better get out there and show those kids
how to tie a few more knots.

05:54.077 --> 05:57.273
I know this isn't your
average intelligence assignment, Steve...

05:57.780 --> 05:59.941
- but it is important.
- Yes, sir, I know.

06:00.449 --> 06:03.577
Food is just as vital
to the war effort as bullets.

06:03.653 --> 06:04.779
That makes sense.

06:04.853 --> 06:07.549
My father said that one steak
is more morale-boosting...

06:07.622 --> 06:09.214
than two Betty Grable movies.

06:09.758 --> 06:12.454
- How soon can you leave for Texas?
- Within the hour.

06:12.627 --> 06:14.651
I'll order your plane readied, sir.

06:15.496 --> 06:17.828
With all them
cowpokes and rustlers around...

06:17.898 --> 06:20.162
you will be careful, won't you, Major?

06:20.267 --> 06:21.256
He better be.

06:21.669 --> 06:24.603
If J.P. Hadley sent all the way
to Washington for our help...

06:24.671 --> 06:27.037
you can bet those rustlers are dangerous.

06:27.106 --> 06:28.573
Yes. Base Operations?

06:28.741 --> 06:30.402
This is Yeoman Prince speaking.

06:31.144 --> 06:34.806
Would you please have Maj. Trevor's plane
readied for immediate takeoff?

06:34.880 --> 06:35.869
Thank you.

06:36.081 --> 06:38.515
Keep me informed, Steve,
and have a good flight.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.107
Yes, sir. Thank you.

06:40.318 --> 06:42.513
I have some priority dictation to get out.

06:42.854 --> 06:43.842
Yes, sir.

06:44.755 --> 06:48.213
If you should happen to run across
any tall, rich, eligible Texan...

06:48.759 --> 06:51.887
I promise to give him your name,
rank, and private phone number.

06:52.630 --> 06:54.358
- Etta!
- Yes, sir.

06:56.366 --> 06:59.096
Anything special you want me to do
while you're gone?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.763
Cheer up. Wipe away that frown.
What's the matter?

07:01.838 --> 07:05.568
You heard what the General said.
Those rustlers could be dangerous.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.233
- You know what your trouble is?
- What?

07:08.377 --> 07:10.538
Too much work
and not nearly enough play.

07:10.612 --> 07:13.375
I order you to take a three-day pass
the minute I leave.

07:13.448 --> 07:15.439
- Understood?
- Understood.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.411
- I'll see you when I get back from Texas.
- Yes, sir.

07:25.192 --> 07:26.819
See you in Texas, Major.

07:39.905 --> 07:42.168
I wanted to talk to you, J. P...

07:42.440 --> 07:44.840
before you went ahead
and called Washington.

07:45.443 --> 07:47.570
It's too late. I've already done it.

07:47.846 --> 07:50.678
And they're sending a real war hero
out here to help.

07:51.048 --> 07:52.345
Maj. Steve Trevor.

07:52.850 --> 07:56.479
We're supposed to catch those
cattle rustlers, J.P., not some outsiders.

07:56.620 --> 08:00.055
I know that.
And I wish you were doing a better job.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.686
Excuse me.
I'll wait for you in the car, Sheriff.

08:05.294 --> 08:07.023
You will have to excuse Walt.

08:07.096 --> 08:09.256
I think his pride's in his way.

08:22.042 --> 08:23.100
We're lucky.

08:23.177 --> 08:26.044
We found some dry kindling wood
and got the fire started.

08:26.113 --> 08:29.707
But before that, we marked off a circle
about ten foot wide...

08:29.783 --> 08:33.412
and we scraped it bare inside the circle.
You know why we did that?

08:36.389 --> 08:38.150
It's really quite simple, sir.

08:38.222 --> 08:42.159
We scrape the area to minimize
any possibility of a spark from our fire...

08:42.494 --> 08:45.952
igniting dry grass, paper, leaves, etcetera.

08:47.799 --> 08:50.063
Is there anything you don't know, Freddie?

08:50.201 --> 08:52.260
Doubtful, old boy.

08:53.738 --> 08:57.002
That sounds like a very revolting situation,
don't you know?

08:58.875 --> 09:02.242
You all keep warm and I'll see
what's happened to our steaks.

09:06.483 --> 09:07.471
Thanks, Jeff.

09:08.617 --> 09:09.606
Just a minute.

09:10.085 --> 09:11.484
We're one steak short.

09:12.021 --> 09:13.955
I ain't hungry.

09:14.323 --> 09:16.552
What's the matter? Don't you feel good?

09:17.025 --> 09:18.424
I'll be all right.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.394
You'd better get back to your new family.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.465
Hey, Walt, Billy Joe, how you doing?

10:41.234 --> 10:42.666
What's going on, Emmett?

10:42.735 --> 10:46.068
- Got us over a hundred head last night.
- I heard about that. Good.

10:46.205 --> 10:50.107
- Hadley complain again?
- All the way to Washington this time.

10:50.175 --> 10:52.540
He even got a little action, too.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.838
What kind of action?

10:53.912 --> 10:57.143
They're supposed to send out
this hotshot major...

10:58.116 --> 10:59.981
and he's supposed to shut us down.

11:00.852 --> 11:02.318
- You serious?
- Yeah.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.417
- I don't want to tangle with the military.
- Neither do I.

11:06.690 --> 11:09.318
What do we do about this Major?
Maybe it's time to quit.

11:09.393 --> 11:11.883
We can't quit.
We got too many commitments to meet.

11:12.995 --> 11:15.793
Besides, we got this one big delivery
left to make.

11:18.534 --> 11:20.161
- Cancel.
- Wait a minute.

11:20.236 --> 11:21.998
What do you mean, cancel, Emmett?

11:22.070 --> 11:24.664
What are you talking about?
You don't cancel the Mob.

11:25.674 --> 11:27.972
Relax. Take it easy.
We're just buying time.

11:28.043 --> 11:31.569
In 24 hours, we'll be out of business
and a whole lot richer...

11:32.446 --> 11:36.177
if we can just keep this Maj. Steve Trevor
off our backs long enough.

11:42.121 --> 11:43.110
I can do that.

12:04.208 --> 12:09.008
- Ready for morning inspection, sir.
- Okay, just right.

12:12.282 --> 12:13.681
Excellent.

12:15.819 --> 12:16.979
You're okay, Sen.

12:17.854 --> 12:21.448
But you could all use a little more
elbow grease behind the ears next time.

12:21.857 --> 12:23.324
What is elbow grease?

12:23.392 --> 12:24.859
You know, old boy. Like so.

12:24.927 --> 12:26.451
That's fine, honey.

12:28.162 --> 12:29.857
How are you this morning, Jeff?

12:31.866 --> 12:33.697
I asked you how you're feeling.

12:34.902 --> 12:38.132
- Fine.
- That's not very convincing.

12:38.572 --> 12:41.507
I think you and I
should have ourselves a little talk.

12:42.576 --> 12:45.136
- About what?
- About whatever's bothering you.

12:45.212 --> 12:48.112
- Freddie, it's your turn.
- No, it's not. It's Linc's turn.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.670
It ain't my turn.

12:49.749 --> 12:52.809
Lincoln, there is no such word as "ain't"
in English.

12:52.885 --> 12:56.820
That's okay,
because all I speak is American...

12:57.088 --> 13:00.455
and this American says
it ain't my turn to say grace.

13:00.959 --> 13:03.189
All right, stop your bickering.

13:03.361 --> 13:06.659
Linc, are you sure
it isn't your turn to say grace?

13:10.167 --> 13:11.930
Well, maybe it is.

13:15.972 --> 13:17.496
Bless this day.

13:18.441 --> 13:22.036
Bless Mr. Hadley for taking us in...

13:22.779 --> 13:24.747
when nobody else wanted us.

13:24.814 --> 13:28.374
Bless this food, and thank you...

13:28.850 --> 13:32.581
for making Texas
a nicer place than Harlem.

13:36.057 --> 13:37.115
Oh, yeah.

13:37.391 --> 13:41.191
See to it that Maj. Trevor
arrives here today safe.

13:41.929 --> 13:42.918
Amen.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.160
Thank you, Linc.

13:47.367 --> 13:50.461
- Where's Charlie Brighteagle?
- He go for ride.

13:57.876 --> 14:00.674
Texas Tower, this is Army six-niner-two...

14:00.746 --> 14:04.306
five miles east of you.
Request landing instructions. Over.

14:04.415 --> 14:07.680
Roger, 692.
You are cleared for a straight-in approach.

14:07.819 --> 14:11.084
Landing runway 84.
Winds westerly at ten knots. Over.

14:12.223 --> 14:15.055
Roger, Texas Tower. Army 692 out.

14:30.172 --> 14:31.161
Jeep coming.

14:32.073 --> 14:33.370
He took the bait.

14:34.642 --> 14:37.440
Coming up the wrong road,
just as nice as you please.

14:40.415 --> 14:44.145
Let's give this eastern dude
a real western-type welcome. Come on.

15:55.582 --> 15:59.176
Good work.
It will take them 24 hours to find him.

15:59.785 --> 16:02.948
If he's lucky. And if he's not...

16:04.623 --> 16:07.455
he's going to be around here a long while.

16:07.559 --> 16:10.722
Anyway, he's out of our hair.
Come on, we got work to do.

16:32.548 --> 16:35.415
I'm Wonder Woman.
I'm looking for my friend, Maj. Trevor.

16:35.985 --> 16:37.451
He's staying here at the ranch.

16:37.519 --> 16:39.953
We are expecting him,
but he hasn't arrived yet.

16:40.021 --> 16:41.283
- Enter, por favor.
- Thank you.

16:41.590 --> 16:44.559
That's very strange,
because his plane landed hours ago.

16:48.796 --> 16:51.856
I'm afraid Charlie will not answer you.
He does not speak.

16:53.634 --> 16:54.623
I see.

17:00.740 --> 17:03.334
I'm kind of worried
about my friend Maj. Trevor.

17:03.476 --> 17:04.602
Have you seen him?

17:06.310 --> 17:07.539
You have? Where?

17:09.047 --> 17:10.377
Can you take me to him?

17:11.717 --> 17:13.082
Thank you very much.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.333
- Steve?
- Yeah, down here.

18:22.780 --> 18:24.771
- Thanks, Wonder Woman.
- You're welcome.

18:24.848 --> 18:27.476
No telling how long I'd be down there
if you didn't come.

18:27.551 --> 18:29.382
I just came from the Diamond H...

18:29.453 --> 18:32.182
and Charlie there
is really the one you have to thank.

18:32.255 --> 18:33.552
Thank you, Charlie.

18:34.557 --> 18:36.616
Since when is Texas your territory?

18:36.693 --> 18:40.129
Since I found out that rustlers
were sabotaging the war effort.

18:40.430 --> 18:41.987
I'm glad to have you here.

18:42.097 --> 18:43.894
I'm glad to be here, Steve.

18:44.032 --> 18:46.500
Mind if I stay around and help?

18:46.935 --> 18:49.927
Not at all. I can use all the help
I can get.

18:52.873 --> 18:57.105
You're a lucky man, Maj. Trevor,
if what J.P. Here is saying is true.

18:57.478 --> 18:59.672
Every word of it is exactly what happened.

18:59.746 --> 19:02.476
Whoever it was
deliberately trapped Maj. Trevor.

19:02.782 --> 19:07.617
If it hadn't been for... a Good Samaritan
who helped me out, I'd still be there.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.848
Yeah, guess you would at that.

19:11.590 --> 19:13.990
Where did you say
this incident took place?

19:14.059 --> 19:16.050
About a mile south of Twin Forks.

19:16.395 --> 19:18.659
- I'll look into it right away.
- Good.

19:20.231 --> 19:22.631
Sounds like somebody's
out to scare Trevor off.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.202
And I'm out to arrest anybody
they may be.

19:25.269 --> 19:26.258
Hold on.

19:26.371 --> 19:29.498
There's no need for you to go.
Billy Joe and me can handle it.

19:30.273 --> 19:32.138
Come on. Honest, we can.

19:43.386 --> 19:45.786
You've got a wonderful group of children.

19:45.855 --> 19:48.584
- Thank you. I'm very proud of them.
- Especially Charlie.

19:48.890 --> 19:51.552
If it hadn't been for him,
I'd still be trapped.

19:51.626 --> 19:53.253
Yes. He's a terrific boy.

19:53.728 --> 19:56.925
- Why can't he talk?
- Not can't, won't.

19:57.798 --> 19:59.493
He has sort of become a loner.

20:00.134 --> 20:02.864
Kind of climbed up inside of himself
and stayed there.

20:03.237 --> 20:04.226
Why?

20:05.339 --> 20:08.136
His father was my foreman here
at the Diamond H.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.807
Him and Charlie
were just as close as could be.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.577
He was killed at Pearl Harbor,
and Charlie's been that way ever since.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.137
What about his mother?

20:18.617 --> 20:20.278
She died during childbirth.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.347
So you're adopting Charlie
along with the other war orphans?

20:25.457 --> 20:26.445
I'm trying to.

20:26.557 --> 20:30.049
The courts are checking to see
if he has any relatives with prior claims.

20:30.127 --> 20:33.096
I'm sure he'll make a very fine son.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.492
He certainly will.

20:38.902 --> 20:39.960
We have houseguests.

20:40.036 --> 20:42.561
Would you check and see
if their rooms are ready?

20:43.706 --> 20:45.172
How about your luggage?

20:45.674 --> 20:48.142
I'm afraid I don't have any luggage.

20:48.977 --> 20:50.968
Wonder Woman travels very light.

20:52.147 --> 20:55.240
I'm sure Maria will have
something you can wear okay.

20:55.316 --> 20:56.305
Thank you very much.

21:12.466 --> 21:14.626
Okay, Emmett. What happened?

21:15.067 --> 21:19.026
We saw these Bar Six beeves grazing near
the creek and decided to give them a lift.

21:19.104 --> 21:21.163
Beeves? I'm talking about Steve Trevor.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.230
You said you'd keep him out of the way.

21:23.308 --> 21:27.677
He's caught between a rock and a hard
place. No one will find him for a long time.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.475
I was talking to him at Diamond H,
for your information.

21:30.548 --> 21:33.209
Impossible. I put him in a hole
with a rock on top.

21:33.283 --> 21:36.616
You two boys have been drinking
too much rot-gut whiskey.

21:36.687 --> 21:39.781
- You have been seeing things.
- Not true. We haven't had a drink.

21:39.857 --> 21:41.722
Now, look, Walt, I told you...

21:42.025 --> 21:44.618
We've got commitments
and by golly, we'll fill them.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.686
I don't care
if the whole United States Marine Corps...

21:47.763 --> 21:49.253
shows up around here.

21:49.465 --> 21:52.228
We started something, we'll finish it.
You got that?

22:01.509 --> 22:05.309
Yes, my bracelets do have the power
to fend off bullets.

22:06.013 --> 22:09.141
But it is only because
they're made of a very special metal.

22:09.617 --> 22:12.050
Now does anybody else
have any questions to ask?

22:12.151 --> 22:15.848
What about your Magic Belt,
what is its secret?

22:16.956 --> 22:20.323
If I told you that, it wouldn't be a secret
any longer, would it?

22:21.627 --> 22:24.494
What I can tell you is
it is my source of strength...

22:24.563 --> 22:26.053
when I'm away from home.

22:26.131 --> 22:27.359
Where's your home?

22:27.833 --> 22:29.061
On Paradise Island.

22:29.268 --> 22:33.067
With a belt like that,
I'd be king of England.

22:33.170 --> 22:36.071
You are all very special,
and you are all different.

22:36.641 --> 22:40.098
But I want to be much bigger
and stronger, like you.

22:40.544 --> 22:41.704
You can be, Sen.

22:42.212 --> 22:44.976
You can all be what you truly want to be.

22:45.181 --> 22:47.581
- How?
- Let me tell you.

22:48.151 --> 22:50.778
If you take really
good care of yourselves...

22:50.953 --> 22:53.478
and you eat right
and get plenty of exercise...

22:54.723 --> 22:59.625
Speaking of exercise, I do remember
Maria saying something about chores.

23:00.662 --> 23:01.959
- No.
- Of course not.

23:02.230 --> 23:06.030
- I'll talk to you all later, okay?
- Bye.

23:11.505 --> 23:13.097
Please sit down, Mr. Hadley.

23:13.607 --> 23:16.075
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

23:16.143 --> 23:17.474
No, not at all.

23:17.910 --> 23:20.538
J.P. And I
were just discussing the rustlers.

23:20.613 --> 23:21.944
I was telling Steve...

23:22.014 --> 23:25.711
that knowing when and where to strike
is what has made them so successful.

23:25.785 --> 23:28.412
Sounds like it's an inside job to me.

23:28.486 --> 23:30.886
- Exactly.
- It's possible, but...

23:31.756 --> 23:34.725
we can't find their hideout,
much less the informer.

23:34.793 --> 23:36.317
That's what we're here for.

23:36.394 --> 23:38.884
How many ranchers
have been hit by the rustlers?

23:38.963 --> 23:40.123
Every one.

23:40.197 --> 23:43.792
Of course, the Diamond H has been hit
the most because we have more cattle.

23:44.301 --> 23:47.701
If we could only get an idea
who their leader is, that'd be a start.

23:47.770 --> 23:50.136
We've got a pretty good idea
who the leader is.

23:51.007 --> 23:53.134
A fellow by the name of Emmett Dawson.

23:53.276 --> 23:55.244
Proving it is a whole different story.

23:55.712 --> 23:59.408
Of course, even if we could prove it,
he is in hiding and a hard man to find.

24:00.115 --> 24:01.946
How much do you know about him?

24:02.017 --> 24:04.076
Emmett was our local dead-end kid.

24:04.586 --> 24:06.985
Born and raised here,
but we're not proud of it.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.951
What caused him to go bad?

24:10.057 --> 24:11.354
He was an orphan.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.090
Never had any folks
to bring him up proper.

24:14.629 --> 24:16.994
Maybe that's why
I took on those war orphans...

24:17.063 --> 24:19.258
so they wouldn't end up like Emmett.

24:19.733 --> 24:22.224
You're a very generous man.

24:22.569 --> 24:24.036
I'm a very lucky man.

24:24.738 --> 24:27.069
Those youngsters fill a need.

24:27.473 --> 24:31.910
Jeff's mother and I would have had enough
kids to form our own baseball team...

24:31.977 --> 24:33.808
if she'd lived.

24:34.013 --> 24:37.607
But I guess life's nothing
if it's not filled with ifs.

24:42.587 --> 24:44.281
Come on, Charlie.

24:46.890 --> 24:48.790
Hello, Wonder Woman.

24:49.593 --> 24:50.855
Maybe you can help.

24:51.094 --> 24:52.527
Sure. If I can.

24:52.929 --> 24:55.897
In addition to being antisocial,
Charles is also selfish.

24:55.998 --> 24:58.796
He flatly refuses to teach us how to lasso.

24:59.001 --> 25:01.401
Wonder Woman's got a lasso, too.

25:01.470 --> 25:03.733
Yes, but mine happens to be magic.

25:03.872 --> 25:06.636
You see, anyone that's bound with it
must tell the truth.

25:06.708 --> 25:09.575
With all due respect,
I find that rather hard to believe.

25:10.111 --> 25:13.011
- Would you like to try it?
- Most certainly.

25:13.313 --> 25:15.144
All right. Let me see.

25:17.251 --> 25:18.479
How old are you?

25:19.453 --> 25:21.683
- Eleven.
- How old did you say?

25:26.225 --> 25:27.852
Okay. Let's see how this fits.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.459
Now, how old are you?

25:31.897 --> 25:33.057
Ten and a half.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.891
First he was 11, now 10. How come?

25:38.070 --> 25:40.903
My Magic Lasso
forced him to tell the truth.

25:42.473 --> 25:44.304
But how'd you know he was lying?

25:44.542 --> 25:47.739
He wasn't actually lying,
just stretching the truth a little bit.

25:48.779 --> 25:52.942
Most boys Freddie's age
like to add a few months on to their age.

25:54.184 --> 25:57.813
I didn't mean to embarrass you, Freddie.
Just to sort of teach you a lesson.

26:02.491 --> 26:04.982
Looks like someone's calling you.

26:08.263 --> 26:11.197
I'm afraid we forgot to empty the trash.
Excuse us.

26:11.299 --> 26:12.288
Oh, yes.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.414
I got some information for you.

26:42.193 --> 26:43.285
I'm listening.

26:43.361 --> 26:46.228
First, I want to know
about that business with Steve Trevor.

26:46.297 --> 26:49.094
- What about him?
- You promised no one would get hurt.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.200
Nobody did, did they?

26:52.035 --> 26:54.128
Come on, give. What's the information?

26:54.805 --> 26:55.931
It's the herd.

26:56.373 --> 26:59.830
My dad's having part of it moved down
to the North 40 tomorrow morning.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.103
What about security?

27:01.177 --> 27:04.977
We ain't got none at night anymore.
Three more of our hands got drafted.

27:05.414 --> 27:07.041
Trevor ain't alone, though.

27:07.116 --> 27:08.946
He's got Wonder Woman helping him.

27:10.418 --> 27:12.750
She's the one who sprung him
out of the trap.

27:13.388 --> 27:16.118
Don't you worry about that.
We'll take care of her.

27:17.124 --> 27:20.287
All we need is one more big haul
and we'll all be a lot richer.

27:22.062 --> 27:25.395
You just keep doing your work,
okay, kid? That's all.

27:26.567 --> 27:28.295
Yeah, well, don't count on it.

27:28.701 --> 27:31.192
Why? What's wrong with you?

27:31.437 --> 27:32.631
What do you mean?

27:35.241 --> 27:37.299
Is your conscience bothering you again?

27:38.377 --> 27:40.572
I hate doing this informing.

27:42.314 --> 27:43.542
Let me tell you...

27:43.982 --> 27:46.677
what your daddy is doing to you
is a whole lot worse.

27:47.952 --> 27:49.886
Ignoring his own flesh and blood...

27:50.822 --> 27:53.290
spending all that time
with those other kids.

27:53.357 --> 27:55.222
I mean, they are total strangers.

27:56.660 --> 27:58.457
I don't like to say this, but...

27:59.429 --> 28:02.626
I don't think your daddy gives a hoot
what happens to you.

28:05.868 --> 28:09.861
It's just a good thing that
you've got loyal friends like us around.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.007
- I guess you're right.
- Sure.

28:16.010 --> 28:18.035
The first thing we have to find out is...

28:18.546 --> 28:21.174
where does Wonder Woman
get all her strength from?

28:21.616 --> 28:23.982
And that will be up to you.

28:24.751 --> 28:28.881
- Up to me?
- You're gonna have to help us find out.

28:30.524 --> 28:33.049
Okay, son.

29:02.318 --> 29:04.650
I'll see your ten and raise you twenty.

29:05.288 --> 29:06.880
Cards to the players.

29:08.524 --> 29:11.254
Sounding good, son. Howdy, boys.

29:13.028 --> 29:14.427
Got some news for you.

29:15.364 --> 29:19.232
Seems like Wonder Woman helped out
Steve Trevor out of the trap y'all sprung.

29:19.368 --> 29:21.233
I told you we had him in a trap.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.894
Okay, so you told the truth.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.538
The main thing is, the man got away.

29:25.773 --> 29:27.206
What's she doing in Texas?

29:27.275 --> 29:30.642
Seems like she's gonna help Steve Trevor
run us out of business...

29:31.244 --> 29:32.677
or so she thinks.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.873
Deal me in the next hand.

29:41.553 --> 29:43.145
Here you go, son. Thank you.

29:43.222 --> 29:45.349
Don't forget your chips, now.

29:47.927 --> 29:48.916
All righty.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.357
After I clean you pigeons
out of your money...

29:52.830 --> 29:55.025
we can discuss cleaning out
the Diamond H...

29:55.099 --> 29:57.932
out of their cattle,
and cutting all ties with the Mob.

30:12.882 --> 30:17.012
I still say they've got to be getting their
information someway from the inside.

30:17.753 --> 30:19.811
Maybe, but from who?

30:20.422 --> 30:24.188
- How long have you known your sheriff?
- Hansen Bodie?

30:24.259 --> 30:26.056
Just all my life, that's all.

30:26.394 --> 30:28.759
Hansen and I started out
in school together.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.726
And I've never known
a more honest man...

30:32.333 --> 30:33.698
or a better sheriff.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.731
At least not until a couple of years ago.

30:37.037 --> 30:39.470
Hansen doesn't cut it
as good as he used to.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.203
He is getting older.

30:41.674 --> 30:42.936
I guess we all are.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.335
That's why he hired on that deputy,
Walt Lampkin.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.472
Walt Lampkin? What about him?

30:50.015 --> 30:52.711
We've known him for a year or so,
isn't that right, son?

30:54.386 --> 30:57.650
- He came here from Montana.
- Highly recommended, too.

30:57.822 --> 31:02.156
He had testimonial letters from the Chief
of Police, the Mayor, a lot of VIP's.

31:02.226 --> 31:04.626
What else do you know
about the man, personally?

31:04.695 --> 31:05.992
Well, he's a bachelor.

31:06.063 --> 31:09.122
Claims to be 4-F
because of a pierced eardrum.

31:09.466 --> 31:11.957
I guess I really don't know
much about him.

31:14.137 --> 31:16.128
Well, he does seem to know his job.

31:16.271 --> 31:19.240
I think I'll run an FBI check on him
just to make sure.

31:19.708 --> 31:20.697
Use our phone.

31:20.909 --> 31:23.104
Thanks, J.P., but I'd feel more secure...

31:23.178 --> 31:26.340
if I drove out to the air base
and used their scrambler system.

31:26.914 --> 31:28.176
Excuse me.

31:28.950 --> 31:30.440
Want to come along?

31:30.718 --> 31:32.549
I think I'll stay here...

31:33.454 --> 31:35.012
and try to make a friend.

31:47.066 --> 31:48.055
Can I help?

31:48.601 --> 31:49.829
Yes? Terrific.

31:56.708 --> 32:00.166
I tried to reach Walt Lampkin,
but he's in court and can't be disturbed.

32:00.245 --> 32:02.008
- So?
- Just give him a message.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.411
Tell him Trevor's on his way
to the air base...

32:04.481 --> 32:07.541
and he's gonna run an FBI check on him.

32:08.318 --> 32:12.254
- When did Trevor leave for the base?
- About 15 minutes ago, by jeep.

32:12.322 --> 32:14.084
I got to go.

32:16.092 --> 32:18.856
Sorry to hold you up.
I had to take care of something.

32:18.928 --> 32:21.089
That's all right. Your dad's outside.

32:21.164 --> 32:23.757
Charlie, are you sure
you don't want to come with us?

32:25.834 --> 32:27.267
Okay, let's go.

32:33.441 --> 32:35.238
Getting a little saddle-weary?

32:35.476 --> 32:38.639
No, but I think the horse
is getting a little people-weary.

32:38.712 --> 32:40.811
I think the horses
could use a little water.

32:40.846 --> 32:43.006
I think you're right. Shall we?

32:54.259 --> 32:55.248
Snake.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.754
There.

33:39.033 --> 33:40.829
Be careful.

33:41.235 --> 33:43.931
- Can you move it?
- A little.

33:44.671 --> 33:46.536
I think he just has a sprained ankle.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.006
Are you all right, son?

33:48.909 --> 33:52.105
I thought it was all over. Thank you.

33:52.778 --> 33:54.143
I won't forget it.

33:55.815 --> 33:57.976
Think you can ride back to the ranch, son?

33:58.950 --> 34:03.216
If you're sure you're all right,
I'd like to take another look around.

34:03.288 --> 34:04.983
You be careful, okay?

34:42.623 --> 34:43.612
Take it easy.

34:44.492 --> 34:46.789
Grab her. Go get her, boy.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.824
Let's go, Wonder Woman.
Y'all lose something? Come and get it.

34:52.331 --> 34:53.525
Put her in the car.

34:53.766 --> 34:56.963
Like you said, without her Magic Belt,
she's just another woman.

35:18.956 --> 35:22.050
Hello, this is Maj. Steve Trevor
calling from Texas.

35:22.993 --> 35:24.392
I'm fine, thanks.

35:25.328 --> 35:28.855
I need an urgent background report
on a Walter Lampkin.

35:45.646 --> 35:48.774
You are a regular spitfire. There you go.

35:49.450 --> 35:52.977
It's a funny thing about ghost towns.
Everything in them goes to pot...

35:53.087 --> 35:56.749
except the jail cells.
They always keep working. See you.

36:45.066 --> 36:47.534
Okay, let's get that dude.

36:48.403 --> 36:50.769
Let's show him some real driving.

37:49.623 --> 37:51.056
Good afternoon, Major.

37:51.859 --> 37:53.224
Begging your pardon.

37:53.661 --> 37:56.425
Do you mind telling us
why you didn't stop back there...

37:56.497 --> 37:58.327
when you were signaled, sir?

37:59.733 --> 38:00.722
Instinct.

38:01.267 --> 38:03.394
I got a hunch you know where I've been.

38:04.471 --> 38:06.564
And I've got a hunch that you are right.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.307
You are a phony, Lampkin. An impostor.

38:13.479 --> 38:18.006
The real Walter Lampkin
died a hero's death in the South Pacific.

38:18.716 --> 38:20.684
You must have adopted his identity...

38:20.752 --> 38:24.654
stolen his letters of recommendation,
and set up shop here.

38:25.223 --> 38:27.349
Probably to run the rustling operation.

38:28.325 --> 38:32.261
Well, what do you know, looks like
the war hero has done his homework.

38:35.832 --> 38:37.662
You are a problem, now, Major.

38:38.901 --> 38:41.870
I just don't know
what I'm gonna have to do with you...

38:43.439 --> 38:44.428
sir.

38:51.646 --> 38:52.670
Come.

38:54.983 --> 38:56.472
Charles, you spoke.

38:57.117 --> 38:59.449
Wonder Woman is our friend.
She needs our help.

39:21.807 --> 39:24.934
Here's where we all must help.
Wonder Woman is locked inside.

39:25.142 --> 39:27.633
- What do we do?
- Let's use this.

39:43.759 --> 39:46.922
- Kids, what are you doing here?
- Wonder Woman, are you all right?

39:46.995 --> 39:49.429
Yes, I'm fine, but how did you find me?

39:49.498 --> 39:51.728
- It was Charlie.
- Yes, he spoke.

39:54.335 --> 39:55.632
Did you really speak?

39:56.204 --> 39:59.662
You said we were friends.
And I couldn't leave you here like this.

40:01.709 --> 40:03.608
Thank you so much.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.041
I told you we'd be friends, Charlie.

40:25.563 --> 40:26.552
Let's go.

40:30.735 --> 40:34.602
You mean that Lampkin and Hanks locked
you in the cell and just left you there?

40:34.671 --> 40:38.937
That's right. If it hadn't been
for my friends, I'd probably still be there.

40:39.309 --> 40:40.298
Thanks, kids.

40:40.643 --> 40:42.941
I just can't tell you how proud I am of you.

40:43.112 --> 40:45.478
And I'll bet Maria
will be proud of you, too.

40:45.548 --> 40:49.211
She has got a real surprise for you.
Hot apple pie, fresh out of the oven.

40:50.052 --> 40:51.848
Don't let it get cold, now.

40:53.522 --> 40:55.786
Save a piece for me.

41:02.730 --> 41:05.756
I just can't wait till I get my hands
on that Walt Lampkin.

41:06.267 --> 41:09.429
You know, what I don't understand
is why he tipped his hand...

41:09.769 --> 41:11.930
or even how he knew
about me being here.

41:16.609 --> 41:18.600
There's something I gotta tell you.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.980
Wonder Woman's saving my life
like she did...

41:25.751 --> 41:27.651
it got me to thinking.

41:28.786 --> 41:31.016
I just can't keep on with what I am doing.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.715
Lampkin runs the rustling operation...

41:34.158 --> 41:36.023
and him and Dawson are partners.

41:36.727 --> 41:38.216
How do you know all this?

41:40.864 --> 41:42.491
Because I'm in on it.

41:46.102 --> 41:47.399
I'm their informer.

41:48.637 --> 41:51.265
No, Jeff. Why?

41:54.109 --> 41:57.373
It had to do with Charlie, Freddie,
and the other kids.

41:57.445 --> 42:00.414
Before they came,
it was always you and me.

42:01.516 --> 42:02.847
You're jealous?

42:04.385 --> 42:08.218
You spent so much time with them.
I needed you, too.

42:09.356 --> 42:11.256
Why didn't you say something?

42:11.425 --> 42:15.088
I mean, tipping those rustlers just
to get even with me doesn't make sense.

42:15.329 --> 42:16.989
I didn't do it to get even.

42:18.598 --> 42:21.965
Lampkin... he said
you didn't care about me.

42:22.101 --> 42:24.001
But he did care.

42:24.503 --> 42:26.527
He took an interest in me.

42:28.139 --> 42:30.437
He didn't ignore me
for a bunch of other kids.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.513
That bunch of other kids,
they're war orphans.

42:38.649 --> 42:40.549
They've lost both their parents.

42:41.785 --> 42:45.515
They're frightened children.
They're bewildered, they're vulnerable.

42:45.989 --> 42:48.617
They needed a strong, fine man
like your daddy.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.359
But that doesn't mean...

42:53.663 --> 42:56.529
that your daddy loves you
any less than he ever did.

42:56.898 --> 43:00.766
Son, everything Wonder Woman said
is just as true as it could be.

43:01.570 --> 43:04.538
Those children needed help.
They were hurting bad.

43:04.605 --> 43:06.038
Needed a lot of attention.

43:06.574 --> 43:09.134
I thought you understood,
but I guess you didn't.

43:09.210 --> 43:12.043
Walt Lampkin saw that,
and he used it on you.

43:12.713 --> 43:14.043
What you did was wrong.

43:14.948 --> 43:17.280
But I can understand why it happened...

43:17.884 --> 43:20.318
and I'm as much to blame for it as you are.

43:23.089 --> 43:24.749
No, it was me, Dad.

43:25.824 --> 43:27.917
I was really mixed up.

43:29.361 --> 43:30.988
But I'm not anymore.

43:32.498 --> 43:34.624
Son, when you get to feeling better...

43:34.932 --> 43:36.331
we'll talk this all out.

43:36.634 --> 43:39.899
And there won't ever be
any more misunderstandings between us.

43:41.706 --> 43:45.539
Jeff, did Lampkin know that Steve
was on his way to the air base and why?

43:46.943 --> 43:49.605
- We've got to get to them.
- We don't know where to look.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.375
Lampkin always knows
where you can find Dawson.

43:52.448 --> 43:55.781
Why don't you try their hideout,
the old ghost town due east of here?

43:55.851 --> 43:58.479
- J.P., I'll meet you at the ghost town.
- Fine.

44:04.893 --> 44:07.259
Okay, soldier. Get the door, Dawson.

44:07.495 --> 44:10.794
Here we go, big fella.
You want room service, you ring for it.

44:10.865 --> 44:12.627
In the freezer, big fella.

44:12.966 --> 44:16.561
With both of them out of the way,
we can concentrate on our final shipment.

44:16.637 --> 44:20.266
Good deal, because this time tomorrow,
I'll be plain old-fashioned retired.

44:20.340 --> 44:22.830
- Don't worry.
- Worry? Who's worried?

45:24.631 --> 45:25.620
Go get him.

45:29.869 --> 45:31.393
Getting loose. Get his arms.

45:50.554 --> 45:53.022
You take Wonder Woman.
You get the cowboy.

46:17.845 --> 46:20.177
What's going on?

46:22.183 --> 46:25.549
From the boots up, he looks
just like Dawson, our dead-end kid.

46:34.726 --> 46:35.920
- You okay?
- I got it.

46:37.996 --> 46:38.985
M35.

46:40.632 --> 46:41.621
I don't have.

46:43.602 --> 46:44.898
I have to leave now.

46:45.203 --> 46:47.728
Linc, take good care of yourself, okay?

46:48.039 --> 46:51.338
- Don't worry about me, Wonder Woman.
- And Babette, good-bye.

46:59.316 --> 47:00.681
And Sen, my friend...

47:01.117 --> 47:02.482
Good-bye, Wonder Woman.

47:03.752 --> 47:06.277
- And you, you little rascal.
- Cheerio, Wonder Woman.

47:06.355 --> 47:08.823
It was a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

47:09.859 --> 47:10.848
And Jeff.

47:16.364 --> 47:17.353
Good luck.

47:18.766 --> 47:19.755
Thank you.

47:20.735 --> 47:23.294
- Sen, where's Charlie?
- He's over there.

47:27.875 --> 47:29.502
- Good-bye.
- See you.

47:59.470 --> 48:00.731
I have to go now.

48:01.404 --> 48:04.168
But we're friends
and friends will always be friends.

48:04.274 --> 48:05.298
That's right.

48:06.276 --> 48:08.710
I'll come back and see you
as often as I can.

48:13.382 --> 48:16.317
Here, I made this for you
so you will always remember me.

48:21.822 --> 48:24.689
Charlie, I'll never forget you. I promise.

48:25.226 --> 48:28.161
It's beautiful and it fits.

48:28.462 --> 48:29.758
Thank you very much.

48:29.863 --> 48:32.388
Now I have to think
of a gift to give to you.

48:32.465 --> 48:34.558
Is there anything you want special?

48:34.901 --> 48:37.028
- There is something.
- Name it.

48:38.004 --> 48:40.335
Would you teach me to lasso
with a real rope?

48:42.207 --> 48:45.301
Being a Navajo Indian
who can't even rope is embarrassing.

48:45.811 --> 48:48.006
Charlie Brighteagle, you got a deal.

48:48.080 --> 48:49.376
- You mean it?
- Sure.

48:49.447 --> 48:52.575
- You'll really teach me?
- Yes, I'll really teach you.

48:53.217 --> 48:54.980
- Right now, if you like.
- I like.

49:55.940 --> 49:56.964
