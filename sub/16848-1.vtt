WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:05.073
Excuse me.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.076
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, spank me.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.010
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.813
We're going to have to slice off
your son's cock.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.048
This part.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.750
We got a school-bus crash off
the 495.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.452
Fifty kids badly injured,
broken bones,

00:18.519 --> 00:21.222
some of them retarded,
the whole deal...

00:21.289 --> 00:22.723
...and they're coming here.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.997
Glenn, stop.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.266
We're breaking up.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.702
No, it's not because
you're Jewish.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.773
Attention, staff: Dr. Richie,
please pick up

00:39.840 --> 00:42.710
your scissors
from the autopsy room.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.879
A hospital isn't a place for
lazy people.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.948
A hospital is a place
for smart people

00:48.015 --> 00:49.683
who take care of people...

00:49.750 --> 00:53.287
...who aren't smart enough
to keep themselves healthy.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.556
Man, she is hot.

00:55.623 --> 00:59.193
I would like to bang her
in her clumsy vagina.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.761
But we all have brains...

01:00.828 --> 01:04.498
...and brains are messy things
filled with jelly.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.868
And although jelly is sweet,
it made me do a silly thing.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.537
I broke up with Glenn.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.806
What? Why? He's the hottest
doctor at Childrens.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.842
I just can't imagine
spending every Christmas

01:14.908 --> 01:16.444
with a Jew, you know?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.679
Lighting candles all the time,
telling knock-knock jokes.

01:18.746 --> 01:22.416
Totally. Driving minivans,
reading books.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.318
Right?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.388
I'm gonna break up with Owen.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.590
-Why?
-Well, you broke up with Glenn.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.959
We're roommates.
That would be totally confusing.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.894
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.363
How you gonna do it?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.199
I don't know. I need to think
of a good lie.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.668
I wish he were Jewish.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.772
Mommy, I'm scared.

01:44.838 --> 01:45.839
Bitches.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.376
-Blake.
-Blake.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.179
-Want me to tickle your arm?
-Yeah. Do it.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.014
-Okay. You're there.
-No. Look.

01:54.081 --> 01:56.784
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.286
What's up?

01:58.352 --> 01:59.820
Look, you're the attending
physician...

01:59.887 --> 02:02.556
...I need your permission.
I wanna cut this kid open.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.692
-Why? She's got a broken arm.
-Says who?

02:04.758 --> 02:07.428
-The x-ray.
-Please, I don't trust these...

02:07.495 --> 02:09.896
...they're not even in color.
Look, I gotta open her up.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.733
What if it's something more
serious? What if it's AIDS?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.169
I don't know this kid.
I gotta make sure

02:15.236 --> 02:17.471
she's got the right type
of arm guts.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.106
I'm supposed to trust
some textbook

02:19.173 --> 02:21.141
or some black-and-white
space photo?

02:21.209 --> 02:24.778
Come on. I'm a doctor.
It's what I do.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.949
Prep the O.R.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.452
You'd better be right this time.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.625
There you are.
You wanna scrub in,

02:37.691 --> 02:39.793
watch me tear
into a youngster's flesh?

02:39.860 --> 02:43.697
-No. I wanna break up with you.
-What? Why?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.299
Are you Jewish?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.735
Have you ever seen me
drive a minivan?

02:47.801 --> 02:50.238
No. Then....

02:50.304 --> 02:53.140
I have a brain tumor.

02:53.207 --> 02:56.109
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Yeah.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.511
How long have you known?

02:57.578 --> 02:59.747
How long have I known?
How long have I known?

02:59.813 --> 03:03.451
I can't lie. I don't have
a brain tumor. I just--

03:03.517 --> 03:06.420
I couldn't think of a reason
to break up with you.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.456
Break up? Not with you
sick like this.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.891
-I'm gonna take care of you.
-No, no. Did you--?

03:10.958 --> 03:13.894
-I said I don't have one.
-That's the brain tumor talking.

03:13.961 --> 03:20.000
Oh, my god. No, listen to me.
I don't have a brain tumor.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.802
Go and rest your tumor.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.239
I'd kiss you goodbye but I don't
wanna get brain cancer.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.010
Hey, roomie.

03:30.077 --> 03:34.114
-I poured you a Grig.
-Hi.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.817
Well, how'd it go with Owen?

03:36.884 --> 03:41.422
-I broke up with him.
-Oh, babe. How'd you do it?

03:41.489 --> 03:44.091
I told him I had a brain tumor.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.795
Wow! That's a good one.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.265
-Well....
-Babe.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.302
Hey. I don't want you to be sad.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.337
I want you to dance it out.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.972
-I don't know.
-Yes.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.676
Are you sure?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.746
-What's happening?
-All right.

04:05.813 --> 04:10.851
-Yeah. Come on, come on.
-All right. This does feel good.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.387
Feel it. Just shake it.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.930
Sometimes, no matter
how smart you are...

04:22.996 --> 04:26.400
...you have to do what your
brain jelly tells you to do.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.637
Only problem is,
jelly is messy...

04:29.703 --> 04:33.273
...and you could get it
all over yourself.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.755
And that's why the only thing
better than today is tomorrow.

04:52.092 --> 04:56.063
-So inspiring.
-Yeah. I wish I had cancer.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.932
-I wanna break up with you.
-What? Why?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.434
Are you Jewish?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.743
What is love?

05:09.810 --> 05:13.280
How fine is the line
between love and like...

05:13.347 --> 05:16.884
...between best friend
and lover?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.986
How much can we
love one another

05:19.052 --> 05:22.322
if we don't even love
ourselves?

05:22.390 --> 05:23.724
We live our lives,

05:23.791 --> 05:27.528
and we try to find meaning
in our jobs...

05:27.595 --> 05:29.363
...and sometimes we make it
our jobs

05:29.430 --> 05:31.899
to find meaning in our lives.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.605
And we eat and we breathe
and we sleep...

05:37.671 --> 05:40.974
...and sometimes we go
to the bathroom.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.611
It's called life.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.448
And what do you get
when you cross life and love...

05:48.148 --> 05:49.149
...with Lola?

05:49.216 --> 05:51.919
"Loofa."

05:53.353 --> 05:56.223
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.892
Oh, you got a bat in the cave.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.563
-What?
-You got a stalagmite.

06:02.630 --> 06:07.000
You have a booger.
Other nostril.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.136
Attention, staff:
Will Captain Pierce

06:09.202 --> 06:11.805
please report to Colonel Blake?
That is all.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.906
Thanks.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.678
I guess I must have
given you my cold.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.647
Yeah.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.249
Gotta run. Pop this kid's
shoulder back into place,

06:22.315 --> 06:24.351
would you? Thanks.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.621
There you are. I found your
panties in my bed this morning.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.891
We broke up a month ago.
How often do you make your bed?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.427
-I'd like to make your bed.
-Glenn, it's over.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.862
No, it's not
because you're Jewish.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.097
A lot of people like candles
and minivans.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.666
What?

06:38.732 --> 06:41.101
Excuse me while I pop
this boy's shoulder into place.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.136
I'd like to pop
your shoulder into place.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.039
Kiss me on the inside
of my stupid mouth.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.976
I can't anymore.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.953
Whatever happened to the healing
power of laughter, you know?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.189
I used to pull
a rabbit out of a hat...

07:02.255 --> 07:05.926
...or a quarter out of a kid's
nose, and...leukemia's gone.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.161
I once cured a case
of Lou Gehrig's disease...

07:08.228 --> 07:10.864
...by pretending I was trapped
inside a box.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.735
Sounds more like the healing
power of magic or mime.

07:14.802 --> 07:18.338
I'm just a claustrophobic clown
in this tiny car of life.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.040
And I can get tiny-carsick.

07:20.107 --> 07:25.746
Hey, Blake, why don't you try
the healing power of medicine?

07:26.313 --> 07:27.681
Medicine?

07:27.748 --> 07:30.684
Why don't I try
the healing power of my ass?

07:30.751 --> 07:33.153
Anyway, thanks
for listening, Chief.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.527
Whoa, what are you doing?

07:39.593 --> 07:42.195
Oh, my God, I totally
misread that. I'm sorry.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.666
Whatever.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.837
So your girlfriend broke up
with you. Who cares?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.740
I've been divorced four times.
You see me crying?

07:54.207 --> 07:55.576
Yeah, right now, you're crying.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.145
Listen, why don't you come back
to the force?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.780
I need my partner back.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.650
I can't, Briggs, not after
what happened to us on 9/11.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.753
You gotta get over 9/11.
That was seven years ago.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.956
It almost seems like it,
doesn't it?

08:09.022 --> 08:13.026
No, it was it. It's 2008,
so 9/11 was seven years ago.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.229
Are you sure it wasn't 2002?
Thought it happened in January.

08:16.296 --> 08:20.801
No. Forget it. Listen,
just come back to the force.

08:20.868 --> 08:24.638
Maybe this will change your
mind. Your old shield.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.643
And your piece.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.211
Briggs, I'm a doctor now.

08:31.278 --> 08:35.282
In my line of work,
I use a different kind of gun.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.817
A gun that doesn't take bullets.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.720
I get it. You're talking
about a scalpel.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.688
No. Laser gun.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.324
-Christ.
-Yeah.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.726
You use that thing for surgery?

08:45.793 --> 08:48.696
Oh, God, no. I vaporize
people with it.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.165
Did you know that in outer space
there are no laws?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.136
We should go there.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.706
Could you and I be married
in outer space?

08:58.772 --> 09:01.775
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.044
So that's it.
Thank you for watching these.

09:04.111 --> 09:08.281
The first two episodes of
'Childrens Hospital' ever.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.852
Um, you know, watching these
episodes, I was kinda reminded

09:11.919 --> 09:15.255
of why I got into this whole
business in the first place.

09:15.322 --> 09:21.094
When I was a kid I used to put
on these plays in my basement

09:21.161 --> 09:25.065
and my babysitter Kurt used to
direct me and it was..

09:25.132 --> 09:26.834
We-we would just
have so much fun.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.401
Like, he would just tell me
to do certain things.

09:28.468 --> 09:33.473
Like once he had me, um,
had me take my pants off..

09:33.540 --> 09:36.109
and um..

09:39.312 --> 09:42.415
Wait, that can't be right.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.185
He..

09:48.188 --> 09:50.658
Oh my God!

09:50.724 --> 09:55.495
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

09:55.562 --> 09:58.598
Oh my God! Oh my Go..

09:58.666 --> 10:02.836
No...No, no-no-no-no..

10:03.971 --> 10:07.440
Oh, that son of a bitch.

10:07.507 --> 10:12.813
That son of a bitch.
Oh my God!

10:12.880 --> 10:18.151
Oh...I can't!
I can't! Oh my God!

10:18.218 --> 10:20.888
'Oh my God!
That son of a bitch!'
