WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:06.297
I can't believe you elbowed me
in the face, D.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.087
It was an accident, Charles.
Come inside.

00:08.087 --> 00:09.401
I'll get you an ice pack.

00:12.767 --> 00:15.358
Vicky, I've got Charles with me.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.461
Vicky.

00:17.771 --> 00:18.908
Damian.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.760
Vicky.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:40.300 --> 00:41.226
I'm just saying,

00:41.300 --> 00:43.185
the first Valentine's Day
you spend with somebody

00:43.219 --> 00:44.703
is important.

00:44.737 --> 00:46.671
Yeah, but Lanie doesn't care
about that stuff, bro.

00:46.706 --> 00:48.623
All women care.
Beckett, you and Josh...

00:48.674 --> 00:50.675
You got big plans
for Valentine's Day, right?

00:50.709 --> 00:53.384
Josh is a surgeon.
I'm a cop.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.430
In the unlikely event
that we have a couple of hours free

00:55.465 --> 00:57.382
on Monday night,
we might go to dinner.

00:57.416 --> 00:59.050
See?

00:59.085 --> 01:01.940
Hey, Castle. It's Beckett.
Call me when you get this.

01:01.941 --> 01:04.322
Ooh, Castle's gonna be sorry
that he missed this one.

01:04.322 --> 01:06.385
Why?
Rich people, man.

01:06.386 --> 01:08.588
Society murders
are always the freakiest.

01:10.090 --> 01:12.058
The call came in
about an hour ago.

01:12.092 --> 01:14.093
The owner of the house,
Damian Westlake...

01:14.127 --> 01:16.379
Says all was well when he left at 5:00 P.M.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.266
To meet his neighbor, Charles Utley,

01:18.267 --> 01:19.716
for a game of pickup.

01:19.768 --> 01:21.814
When the men returned at 6:00 P.M.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.665
Victoria Westlake was dead.
Murder weapon?

01:26.677 --> 01:28.972
Nail gun. It's over there.

01:30.081 --> 01:33.751
See? Told you. Freaky.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.773
The back door was ajar.

01:35.774 --> 01:37.209
Officers found what appears to be

01:37.210 --> 01:39.710
a gang tag on the rear wall
of the building.

01:39.744 --> 01:41.881
The paint's fresh.
I'll reach out to the gang unit,

01:41.882 --> 01:45.367
see if they can I.D. it for us.
And I'll talk with Mr. Utley.

01:46.625 --> 01:49.002
The Westlakes have a dog.
So if neighbors heard barking,

01:49.037 --> 01:50.952
we might be able to pinpoint a timeline.

01:50.953 --> 01:53.129
We've canvassed, and nobody heard the dog.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.761
The M.E. tentatively puts time of death

01:54.762 --> 01:56.892
between 30 and 6:00. 4:30,

01:56.893 --> 01:58.578
which means she might have been dead

01:58.579 --> 02:00.787
before the husband left the house.

02:00.838 --> 02:03.907
Where is Mr. Westlake?
Thank you.

02:08.412 --> 02:10.520
Mr. Westlake, I'm detective Kate...

02:12.131 --> 02:12.816
Castle.

02:15.319 --> 02:17.220
Castle, what are you doing here?

02:17.288 --> 02:19.569
Damian Westlake is an old friend of mine

02:19.570 --> 02:20.795
from boarding school.

02:20.796 --> 02:23.144
He knows about my relationship
with the NYPD.

02:23.145 --> 02:24.566
He just called me to give him some support.

02:24.567 --> 02:25.284
Which is when you should've

02:25.285 --> 02:28.077
called me to let me know.
I just got here,

02:28.078 --> 02:30.626
and I had no idea this would be your case.

02:30.627 --> 02:31.506
Well, now that you do,

02:31.507 --> 02:32.736
is there anything you want to tell me

02:32.770 --> 02:33.481
that might be pertinent?

02:33.482 --> 02:36.127
Uh, nothing.
I'd never even met Vicky.

02:36.128 --> 02:38.012
But now at least I can tell Damian

02:38.013 --> 02:39.852
the finest detective in New York city

02:39.854 --> 02:41.796
is working his wife's case.

02:42.623 --> 02:45.225
Everything was fine when she left.

02:45.953 --> 02:48.655
The last thing she said to me was,
"have a good game."

02:48.656 --> 02:49.976
Mr. Westlake, do you know of anyone

02:49.977 --> 02:51.610
that might have wanted to harm Vicky?

02:51.611 --> 02:53.412
No, everyone loved her.

02:53.763 --> 02:55.941
Someone spray painted your back wall.

02:55.942 --> 02:58.176
Did you notice anyone suspicious

02:58.211 --> 02:59.878
hanging out when you left?

02:59.913 --> 03:02.414
No. Vicky shouldn't even have been here.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.850
She came home early from work
with a headache.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.289
Hey. We're gonna catch the guy
who did this, okay?

03:07.290 --> 03:08.387
I promise.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.971
What did she do for a living?

03:09.972 --> 03:11.447
Interior design.

03:11.758 --> 03:12.725
And you?

03:13.192 --> 03:14.268
Uh...

03:15.295 --> 03:18.679
Damian's a writer.
Anything I might have read?

03:18.680 --> 03:20.706
No, I've never been published.

03:20.707 --> 03:23.148
How long were the two of you married?
Five years.

03:23.149 --> 03:25.917
And would you characterize
your relationship as happy?

03:25.918 --> 03:28.460
Whoa. Why would you need
to ask that?

03:28.461 --> 03:30.087
It's all right, Ricky.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.311
I loved my wife very much.

03:33.082 --> 03:35.087
She was my whole world.

03:35.088 --> 03:36.715
Mr. Westlake, I'm sorry,

03:36.716 --> 03:37.635
but I'm gonna have to ask you

03:37.636 --> 03:40.878
a few questions about the murder weapon.
Okay. Um...

03:40.879 --> 03:42.296
Why would you need to ask him

03:42.297 --> 03:43.905
about the murder weapon?
Castle.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.169
The nail gun, was that yours?

03:47.170 --> 03:49.405
No. We've been doing some remodeling.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.570
Any tools in the house

03:50.571 --> 03:52.241
belong to the workmen.
Did you ever have any...

03:52.275 --> 03:54.643
Were there ever any issues
with these workmen?

03:54.678 --> 03:57.267
Yeah, uh, I overheard Vicky on the phone

03:57.268 --> 03:58.784
with someone last Friday evening.

03:58.785 --> 04:00.826
She told him he was fired
and he shouldn't come back.

04:00.827 --> 04:01.850
You know his name?

04:01.885 --> 04:04.955
No, I asked her about it.
She told me it was nothing.

04:04.956 --> 04:07.998
Talk to Amber Patinelli.
Amber works for Vicky.

04:08.566 --> 04:11.093
Look, if... if you don't mind,
I really need to call

04:11.094 --> 04:13.737
Vicky's ex-husband Simon and her kids.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.023
I'm sure the press is
gonna be all over this,

04:16.024 --> 04:17.880
and I don't want 'em to hear
about it on television.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.002
Of course.
Excuse me.

04:25.107 --> 04:27.225
Hey. Why are you mad at me?

04:27.276 --> 04:28.711
I'm just looking out for my friend.

04:28.712 --> 04:32.747
You challenged my authority in
front of a suspect, Castle.

04:32.781 --> 04:35.615
Since when is Damian a suspect?
Right now everyone is.

04:35.616 --> 04:37.133
You know that.
That's how I do my job.

04:37.134 --> 04:38.403
I will not have you get in the way

04:38.404 --> 04:41.022
of an investigation.
I won't. I won't. I promise.

04:41.056 --> 04:43.624
But now can we get on to
real suspects, like workmen,

04:43.659 --> 04:45.170
like, uh, mystery gang members?

04:45.171 --> 04:47.265
Question away.
Look...

04:48.011 --> 04:50.965
I promised Damian we would
get the guy that did this.

04:51.701 --> 04:53.723
Let me help you. Please.

04:53.724 --> 04:55.825
Yo! Castle.

04:56.555 --> 04:57.370
Hey, you made it.

04:57.371 --> 04:59.947
Yeah. So I talked with

04:59.948 --> 05:02.301
Damian Westlake's friend, Charles Utley.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.628
He said Damian was distraught

05:03.629 --> 05:05.419
when he found his wife's body,

05:05.420 --> 05:08.531
but he also says that during
their normally friendly game,

05:08.532 --> 05:11.159
Damian was unusually tense and aggressive.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.292
So maybe he shoots his wife,

05:12.293 --> 05:13.358
then goes to shoot some hoops,

05:13.359 --> 05:15.875
injures his friend, brings him
inside to establish an alibi.

05:15.876 --> 05:17.619
You know, Vicky Westlake had an argument

05:17.620 --> 05:18.939
with one of her workers on Friday.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.962
A worker who, and I'm
just speculating here,

05:20.996 --> 05:23.314
may have some experience with nail guns.

05:23.315 --> 05:25.199
Maybe we should go run
and check out that lead

05:25.217 --> 05:27.485
before we rush to judgment
on an innocent man.

05:27.486 --> 05:29.641
I'm sorry.
Is this you staying out of the way?

05:29.642 --> 05:30.865
This is me simply making a point

05:30.866 --> 05:33.148
about remaining objective.

05:41.293 --> 05:43.295
Excuse me.
Amber Patinelli?

05:43.296 --> 05:45.729
I'm detective Esposito.
This is detective Ryan.

05:45.730 --> 05:47.950
We'd like to talk with you
about Vicky Westlake.

05:47.951 --> 05:50.991
Of course.
Oh, my God. It's just so terrible.

05:50.992 --> 05:52.626
Vicky's husband said that she had a fight

05:52.627 --> 05:53.810
with one of the workmen at her house.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.661
She fired the carpenter, Morris Hasberg.

05:57.426 --> 05:59.298
Oh, my God.
You don't think that Morris did this?

05:59.299 --> 06:01.350
We're looking at several suspects.

06:02.513 --> 06:04.003
What did Morris do to get fired?

06:04.004 --> 06:05.656
He stole her engagement ring.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.097
Vicky was afraid of getting mugged,

06:07.098 --> 06:09.575
so she didn't wear it much.
Vicky looked for it

06:09.576 --> 06:12.093
in her jewelry box last
week, and it was missing.

06:12.094 --> 06:15.717
Jewelry box? My fiancé never
takes her ring off her finger.

06:15.718 --> 06:17.686
Is your fiancée's ring 11 carats?

06:18.429 --> 06:21.144
Morris was hired to make a
cabinet for the master bath.

06:21.145 --> 06:22.887
He was the only person in the bedroom.

06:22.888 --> 06:24.701
Vicky told him, if he
didn't return the ring,

06:24.735 --> 06:27.236
she'd have to call the police.
Morris went crazy.

06:27.255 --> 06:30.006
Crazy how?
He came to the house on Monday morning,

06:30.041 --> 06:31.474
and he made a scene.

06:31.509 --> 06:33.560
He said that if she
didn't stop telling lies,

06:33.561 --> 06:35.080
bad things would happen.

06:36.885 --> 06:38.456
Morris Hasberg?

06:38.457 --> 06:39.692
Turns out the Westlakes' carpenter

06:39.693 --> 06:41.117
learned his trade at Sing Sing,

06:41.152 --> 06:42.546
where he did eight to ten for armed robbery

06:42.547 --> 06:43.805
back in the late '90s.

06:43.806 --> 06:46.056
Witnesses report seeing
his truck in front of

06:46.090 --> 06:48.145
the Westlakes' town house
on the day of the murder.

06:48.146 --> 06:52.085
Do I see two men jumping on
a hot workmen-related lead?

06:53.202 --> 06:55.672
That sounded a lot dirtier than I...
than I wanted it to.

06:55.673 --> 06:57.687
We'll bring him in.
Okay.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.870
Oh, actually, those were...
those...

07:03.076 --> 07:05.515
See? I told you it wasn't Damian.

07:05.516 --> 07:07.117
I never said it was.

07:07.151 --> 07:09.821
In fact, I would be very
happy if Morris was our guy.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.528
You have wrong guy.

07:11.529 --> 07:14.214
Morris, forensics came
back on the nail gun.

07:14.215 --> 07:16.272
Your fingerprints are all
over the murder weapon.

07:16.273 --> 07:19.629
I must use nail gun for carpenter.

07:19.663 --> 07:20.882
Well, then what was your truck

07:20.883 --> 07:23.716
doing parked on her street on Wednesday?

07:23.767 --> 07:26.150
She say come, uh, see her.

07:26.151 --> 07:27.501
You expect us to believe

07:27.502 --> 07:30.446
that Mrs. Westlake invited
you back into her house

07:30.447 --> 07:32.830
after you stole her ring
and threatened her?

07:32.831 --> 07:35.322
Mrs. Westlake, she find ring.

07:35.323 --> 07:38.567
She called to me and say to come there,

07:38.568 --> 07:41.444
and then she say sorry to accuse.

07:41.445 --> 07:42.969
She cry.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.167
She cry... She cried?

07:45.168 --> 07:46.167
Is true.

07:47.944 --> 07:49.116
Hasberg's alibi

07:49.117 --> 07:50.310
is truth.

07:50.311 --> 07:53.002
Shut the front door.
C.S.U. inventoried the jewelry,

07:53.003 --> 07:54.747
and the engagement ring is there.

07:56.224 --> 07:58.391
But there were other prints on the weapon.

07:58.392 --> 08:00.875
Partials, but none of
them are in the system.

08:00.876 --> 08:02.711
Okay, so what's our new theory?

08:02.712 --> 08:04.031
Who's our new suspect?

08:05.016 --> 08:07.044
Oh, come on. Not Damian.

08:07.045 --> 08:08.137
Castle, bad guys

08:08.138 --> 08:10.345
breaking into houses
bring their own weapons,

08:10.346 --> 08:12.004
dogs bark at strangers,

08:12.005 --> 08:13.290
and over one-third

08:13.291 --> 08:15.409
of domestic female homicide victims

08:15.410 --> 08:16.656
are murdered by their husbands.

08:16.657 --> 08:18.437
I don't care about statistics.

08:18.438 --> 08:22.168
I am telling you, Damian
is not capable of murder.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.056
You know, I could say that
about maybe three people

08:24.057 --> 08:25.648
that I've met in my entire life.

08:25.649 --> 08:28.006
What is it about this guy that...
that warrants

08:28.007 --> 08:30.240
this unshakable faith that you have in him?

08:30.241 --> 08:33.503
When I was 14, my mom sent me
to Edgewyck Academy.

08:33.504 --> 08:37.869
I... I was homesick, and I
didn't have any friends,

08:37.870 --> 08:39.570
so I wrote about it.

08:39.828 --> 08:42.549
One day, I submitted a story
to the literary magazine.

08:42.551 --> 08:45.310
Damian Westlake was the editor.
And he published it.

08:45.311 --> 08:46.386
More than that.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.566
He called me down to his office,

08:48.567 --> 08:51.114
he sat me down, and he said, "Ricky..."

08:54.210 --> 08:56.369
"You have a great talent."

08:59.805 --> 09:02.182
No one had ever said anything
like that to me before.

09:02.891 --> 09:06.189
Damian, he encouraged me,
he critiqued me, he...

09:07.018 --> 09:09.369
He always made me dig a little deeper.

09:13.113 --> 09:16.382
Without Damian Westlake, I'm a lawyer,

09:16.416 --> 09:18.751
I'm a grifter, I'm a rodeo clown,

09:18.785 --> 09:21.320
but I am not a writer.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.658
Without him, I'm not me.

09:27.326 --> 09:29.626
Yo. I ran a standard background check

09:29.627 --> 09:30.863
on Damian Westlake.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.151
Turns out Vicky isn't
the first family member

09:33.152 --> 09:36.437
that he's lost to violence.
You mean his father.

09:37.003 --> 09:40.188
When Damian was 19, his father was killed

09:40.189 --> 09:42.441
at the Westlake vacation
home in Puerto Rico.

09:42.968 --> 09:45.978
Not killed, Castle. Murdered.

09:47.311 --> 09:48.480
And you didn't tell us?

09:48.515 --> 09:50.215
Tell you what?

09:50.819 --> 09:53.588
H-how is the tragic death
of Damian's father

09:53.589 --> 09:54.661
over two decades ago

09:54.662 --> 09:56.158
in any way relevant to this case?

09:56.159 --> 09:57.752
I'll tell you how.

09:58.508 --> 10:01.672
The cops that were investigating that case

10:01.673 --> 10:04.229
named Damian as the prime suspect.

10:17.914 --> 10:21.410
Castle, it's one thing for you
to look out for your friend.

10:21.411 --> 10:22.983
It's a completely different story

10:22.984 --> 10:25.785
when you hide vital information from me.

10:25.786 --> 10:28.499
I wasn't hiding it.
I just didn't think it mattered.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.019
You didn't think it mattered

10:30.053 --> 10:33.064
that Damian was a suspect
in a previous homicide?

10:33.065 --> 10:35.681
I didn't know he was a suspect.

10:35.682 --> 10:36.995
And since he was never arrested,

10:36.996 --> 10:38.341
and that case is still unsolved,

10:38.342 --> 10:40.466
I'm guessing those cops
have a lot of theories

10:40.467 --> 10:42.851
and no evidence, like another
detective I could name

10:42.852 --> 10:43.599
right about now.

10:43.633 --> 10:45.601
You know, if this was anybody else,

10:45.636 --> 10:46.862
you'd be asking me

10:46.863 --> 10:49.072
why I hadn't already
slapped the cuffs on 'em.

10:49.073 --> 10:50.451
But it isn't anyone else.

10:50.452 --> 10:53.003
And I'm telling you, you are
way off base on this one.

10:53.004 --> 10:55.647
What's going on?
Mom and dad are fighting.

10:55.648 --> 10:56.873
Who's winning?

10:56.874 --> 10:58.331
We agreed that you would stay out of my way

10:58.365 --> 11:00.182
on this.
Yes, but I did not agree

11:00.217 --> 11:02.184
I would stand by and let
you railroad my friend!

11:02.219 --> 11:05.254
Castle, you are too close to this one.
You need to go home!

11:05.288 --> 11:07.189
Now!

11:20.166 --> 11:21.300
Yeah... Ryan, Bill.

11:21.301 --> 11:23.105
Really appreciate that.
What about fibers?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.107
Yeah, as soon as possible.
Thank you. Okay.

11:28.161 --> 11:30.363
Let's get ahold of Philip
Westlake's case file.

11:30.364 --> 11:32.133
I want to find out why
no arrests were made.

11:32.134 --> 11:34.655
And Vicky Westlake's
ex-husband, Simon Campbell,

11:34.656 --> 11:36.358
let's bring him in.

11:42.374 --> 11:45.031
Sorry. I... I had to get outta there.

11:45.061 --> 11:46.918
I keep thinking I'm gonna
hear Vicky's voice

11:47.270 --> 11:48.084
or I'm gonna come around the corner

11:48.085 --> 11:50.027
and see her curled up on the sofa.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.529
Listen, Damian, I'm sorry.

11:51.530 --> 11:54.009
Something's come up in the investigation.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.599
Your father's murder...
You were a suspect.

11:58.422 --> 12:01.421
Some creep broke into our house,

12:01.422 --> 12:04.034
robbed the place, and shot my father.

12:04.035 --> 12:06.398
The cops decided on day one
that it must have been me.

12:06.779 --> 12:07.771
Were you there?

12:07.772 --> 12:11.039
I was at college, 2,000 miles away.

12:11.617 --> 12:13.028
I know you and your father didn't have

12:13.029 --> 12:15.553
the, uh, the best relationship.

12:15.554 --> 12:18.070
It only got worse after
my mother passed away.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.766
And when he died, you inherited...

12:20.767 --> 12:22.744
Everything.

12:23.749 --> 12:26.167
Detective Beckett thinks, I
got away with murder once,

12:26.202 --> 12:28.203
now I've done it again, doesn't she?

12:28.237 --> 12:30.538
Ah, Damian, you should've told me.

12:30.573 --> 12:32.741
I'm not a cop. I'm your friend.

12:32.775 --> 12:34.409
That's right. You are.

12:34.443 --> 12:36.410
Remember when you first came to Edgewyck?

12:36.916 --> 12:38.256
I remember.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.958
I was the one that told
them to give you a chance.

12:41.984 --> 12:43.576
I'm looking for the same chance now.

12:45.521 --> 12:48.040
Mr. Campbell, how did you get
along with your ex-wife?

12:49.028 --> 12:51.654
Well, it was hard for a while.
I was bitter.

12:52.061 --> 12:55.022
Vicky left me for him, you know?

12:55.023 --> 12:56.565
Mm-hmm. We had a home.

12:56.599 --> 12:57.876
We had two kids going into their teens,

12:57.877 --> 13:00.110
and she fell madly in
love with Damian Westlake

13:00.111 --> 13:01.044
and left me.

13:01.045 --> 13:03.305
And what did you know about him,
about his past?

13:03.339 --> 13:06.144
I know he doesn't work.
Comes from money, I guess.

13:06.145 --> 13:07.752
Mm-hmm. A typical spoiled child

13:07.753 --> 13:09.311
that grew into a spoiled man.

13:09.345 --> 13:11.359
I know Vicky regretted marrying him.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.413
And why would you say that?

13:12.431 --> 13:13.915
Vicky's business

13:13.950 --> 13:15.884
is on the ground floor of our brownstone.

13:15.918 --> 13:18.253
I still live in the top
two floors with the kids.

13:18.287 --> 13:21.122
I would see her every day, you
know, singing a little tune

13:21.157 --> 13:24.918
or gazing fondly at some new
bauble he had gotten her.

13:24.919 --> 13:28.840
Then lately, there was less
singing and more crying.

13:30.049 --> 13:32.480
Monday, she told me she thought
she had made a mistake.

13:32.481 --> 13:34.402
We even talked about getting back together.

13:34.403 --> 13:35.798
What, you think it's a coincidence

13:35.799 --> 13:37.910
that two days later, she was dead?

13:41.559 --> 13:44.043
Richard, I thought you
went to bed hours ago.

13:44.044 --> 13:45.413
Couldn't sleep.

13:45.414 --> 13:47.530
Couldn't sleep because of
your fight with Beckett

13:47.531 --> 13:50.051
or because there's a possibility

13:50.052 --> 13:52.577
your old friend Damian may
be a double murderer?

13:53.405 --> 13:56.323
Both, and thank you for
putting it so bluntly.

13:56.957 --> 13:57.819
Richard, you know...

13:57.820 --> 13:59.937
Don't. Don't say it.

13:59.938 --> 14:02.109
I know what you're thinking,
'cause I'm thinking it, too.

14:03.675 --> 14:06.329
What are the chances
Damian's father and wife

14:06.330 --> 14:08.197
are both murdered in home invasions,

14:08.232 --> 14:09.878
but he had nothing to do with 'em?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.669
So what do you think?

14:11.670 --> 14:13.970
I know, if he is guilty,

14:14.004 --> 14:17.028
I'll need to be convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.475
I will need solid evidence,

14:19.510 --> 14:22.512
not just coincidence and speculation.

14:22.546 --> 14:24.958
Have you ever known Beckett
to settle for less than that?

14:25.983 --> 14:27.483
No.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.916
Then I think you should face it, kiddo.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.132
You may owe that woman an apology...

14:32.682 --> 14:35.803
Especially if you want to stay on the case.

14:39.404 --> 14:40.382
Oh, no.

14:40.383 --> 14:42.284
Ugh! Oh.

14:43.613 --> 14:44.915
Can I give you a hand with that?

14:45.628 --> 14:46.729
I got it.

14:46.730 --> 14:47.804
You just... all you do...

14:47.838 --> 14:50.206
Castle, I said I got it.
Okay?

14:53.944 --> 14:55.035
What are you doing here?

14:56.349 --> 14:57.372
When I told Damian

14:57.373 --> 14:59.649
the best detective in New York
was working his wife's case,

14:59.683 --> 15:01.684
I meant it, and I'm...

15:01.719 --> 15:04.289
I'm sorry to have doubted you.

15:04.290 --> 15:06.325
If you let me back, I promise,

15:06.326 --> 15:08.938
I will do my best to remain objective.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.624
Well, that might be harder than you think.

15:12.929 --> 15:15.649
The Westlakes' financial records.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.050
This is their prenuptial agreement,

15:17.101 --> 15:18.985
and it's pretty clear that
if they got divorced,

15:19.019 --> 15:21.022
Damian would get nothing,
but with her dead,

15:21.023 --> 15:22.939
he inherits $10 million.
Yes,

15:22.940 --> 15:24.874
but you're forgetting
that Damian is already rich...

15:24.908 --> 15:26.943
The money he got when his father died.

15:26.977 --> 15:27.708
When his father was murdered,

15:27.709 --> 15:30.823
and also, that money is gone.

15:30.824 --> 15:34.094
Last of his cash, Damian
spent wooing Vicky.

15:34.095 --> 15:36.090
He showered her
with expensive presents...

15:36.091 --> 15:39.213
The engagement ring, a tennis bracelet,
diamond earrings.

15:39.214 --> 15:40.503
And then by the time they got married,

15:40.504 --> 15:42.170
Damian was tapped out of money.

15:42.204 --> 15:43.654
Vicky was paying for all the bills.

15:43.655 --> 15:45.288
According to Damian's credit card receipts,

15:45.289 --> 15:47.752
he spent her money on good scotch,

15:47.753 --> 15:49.164
box seats, and Cuban cigars.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.448
Meanwhile, most of her charges are

15:50.449 --> 15:51.727
for her design business...

15:51.728 --> 15:55.116
Appraisers, a rug place, refinisher...
So?

15:55.151 --> 15:57.085
So maybe Vicky got tired
of being his A.T.M.

15:57.119 --> 15:59.815
Maybe she threatened to cut him
off just like his father did.

16:00.172 --> 16:02.656
Castle, I read the Philip
Westlake case files.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.547
The cops were sure it was him.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.733
Yes, but they were wrong,
just like you're wrong now.

16:06.734 --> 16:08.685
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this you being objective

16:08.686 --> 16:10.865
or is this you staying out of my way?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.867
This is me saying,

16:12.902 --> 16:15.804
maybe we could broaden our
suspect pool a little bit.

16:15.838 --> 16:18.757
Certainly there's someone
else we could be looking at.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.097
I think I might be able to help with that.

16:20.098 --> 16:21.952
The gang unit I.D.'ed the tag

16:21.953 --> 16:23.549
on the back wall of the Westlakes'.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.464
It's a personal signature.
The guy's name is Omar Lincoln.

16:26.515 --> 16:29.150
Please, please tell me he's a very bad man.

16:29.185 --> 16:31.060
Well, he did two years for
assault with a deadly weapon

16:31.061 --> 16:33.922
in a B&E in 2007.
Huh?

16:33.956 --> 16:35.713
Called the Graffiti Squad.
They've been tracking this guy.

16:35.714 --> 16:37.028
Got a pop on his location.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.997
All right. Let's go get this guy, huh?

16:41.230 --> 16:43.858
Okay, go. I got it.
Thank you.

16:52.117 --> 16:53.573
Yo, Omar.

16:54.609 --> 16:55.633
Come here.

16:55.634 --> 16:57.854
NYPD, come on down.

16:57.855 --> 16:59.757
So long, Detective.
Oh!

16:59.791 --> 17:01.192
Hey! Yo! Hey! Hey!

17:01.226 --> 17:03.761
Hey, wait a minute!
Ooh! Oh, no. Oh!

17:03.795 --> 17:06.973
NYPD! Stop the truck!

17:06.973 --> 17:09.066
Stop! Stop the truck! Stop!

17:09.084 --> 17:11.234
Stop the truck!

17:11.252 --> 17:12.691
Get down!

17:13.571 --> 17:15.772
Yo, if this is about that dead rich lady,

17:15.807 --> 17:17.262
I don't know nothin'.

17:18.676 --> 17:21.045
All right. Come on. Let's go.

17:26.703 --> 17:29.908
Okay, I was at the house, yeah.
But I didn't kill her.

17:29.909 --> 17:30.887
Here's what I think happened, Omar.

17:30.888 --> 17:32.761
You were back there tagging the wall.

17:32.762 --> 17:35.058
Mrs. Westlake opens the door and sees you.

17:35.059 --> 17:37.516
You shove her inside and you
grab the first weapon you find

17:37.517 --> 17:39.074
so that she doesn't call the cops

17:39.075 --> 17:40.452
and you don't get busted on your parole.

17:40.453 --> 17:41.973
No, no. Look, I tagged the wall.

17:41.974 --> 17:44.572
Right after that, I hit
the flower shop on 63rd.

17:44.573 --> 17:48.241
Owner sees me, pulls a .38,
I get outta there hella fast.

17:48.242 --> 17:50.677
You could ask him.
What time was this?

17:50.678 --> 17:51.997
Quarter to 5:00, about.

17:51.998 --> 17:54.002
You make this vandalism charge go away,

17:54.003 --> 17:56.350
I'll tell you fine detectives who did it.

17:59.509 --> 18:01.001
Okay.

18:01.002 --> 18:03.540
Her husband.
Ah, come on.

18:03.574 --> 18:04.510
Castle.

18:06.337 --> 18:09.754
All right, Omar, talk to me.
I heard them two fighting.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.226
I mean, Beezy had her Park Avenue on.

18:12.227 --> 18:14.219
"You're a liar. You're a thief.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.614
I'm sorry I ever met you.
I want a divorce."

18:16.615 --> 18:18.964
If I was him, I woulda killed her, too,

18:18.965 --> 18:20.457
just to shut her up.

18:20.491 --> 18:24.242
I... I mean...

18:24.243 --> 18:25.712
Don't write that.

18:25.713 --> 18:28.054
I can't believe you're taking
Omar Lincoln at his word.

18:28.055 --> 18:29.954
I'm taking the word of Dan Samuels,

18:29.955 --> 18:33.016
who confirms, at 4:50 P.M.,
he was at his flower shop

18:33.017 --> 18:36.241
pointing a .38 at Omar Lincoln,
and that Omar ran north,

18:36.242 --> 18:37.429
which is in the opposite direction

18:37.430 --> 18:38.094
of the Westlakes' townhome.

18:38.095 --> 18:39.486
Yes, but maybe he doubled back...

18:40.185 --> 18:41.939
Omar says that he overheard
the Westlakes

18:41.940 --> 18:43.581
having a knock-down-drag-out,

18:43.582 --> 18:44.699
and that she used the "d" word.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.540
Damian told us that things
were fine between them

18:46.541 --> 18:48.256
and that the last thing
that Vicky said to him

18:48.257 --> 18:49.523
was "have a good game."

18:49.524 --> 18:51.817
They had a fight. Married people fight.

18:51.818 --> 18:53.312
Well, then why did Damian
lie to us about it?

18:53.313 --> 18:54.536
Maybe he was afraid you'd, I don't know,

18:54.570 --> 18:57.022
suspect him of murder.
Or maybe he was afraid

18:57.056 --> 18:59.452
that we'd figure out what
the fight was about.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.993
These are Damian's credit card charges.

19:02.028 --> 19:04.796
Yeah, we went over those.
Uh, cigars, scotch, box seats.

19:04.831 --> 19:07.299
This is a different card.
Took us a while to find it

19:07.333 --> 19:10.519
because Damian paid the
bill from a pocket account,

19:10.520 --> 19:11.503
and he kept it a secret from Vicky.

19:11.537 --> 19:14.065
And given the charges, I'm sure
he's keeping other secrets.

19:14.066 --> 19:17.090
There's a florist, some
jewelry store at the mall,

19:17.091 --> 19:19.244
and he rented a playroom
at the Varick Club

19:19.278 --> 19:22.192
at least once a week.
What's in a playroom?

19:22.193 --> 19:23.773
Not much more than a bed.

19:25.685 --> 19:27.569
Yes, I'm a member.

19:27.603 --> 19:29.521
So why would Damian rent a bed

19:29.555 --> 19:32.818
when he had a nice big town house?

19:32.819 --> 19:36.014
There's gotta be a-a
reasonable explanation.

19:36.015 --> 19:37.680
Well, let's go see if we can find it.

19:41.469 --> 19:44.769
Mr. Castle, welcome back.
It's been a long time.

19:44.770 --> 19:48.102
Yes, well, I've been, uh, working a lot.
No time for play.

19:48.103 --> 19:48.905
Ah. We're actually here about

19:48.906 --> 19:50.658
another one of your members.

19:50.693 --> 19:51.814
Damian Westlake.

19:52.261 --> 19:54.610
Apparently he would come
here often, rent a playroom.

19:55.340 --> 19:58.612
I should probably get my supervisor.
I...

19:58.613 --> 20:00.407
Callie, it's okay.
You can tell us.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.570
Was Damian meeting someone here?

20:02.604 --> 20:04.072
Um...

20:04.106 --> 20:06.941
We're not supposed to get
involved with members,

20:06.976 --> 20:09.526
especially married members.

20:09.702 --> 20:10.702
But Damian...

20:10.746 --> 20:15.355
We couldn't help it.
We fell in love.

20:15.356 --> 20:17.318
Did he tell you that he
planned on leaving his wife?

20:18.607 --> 20:21.596
Yeah. Did he tell you about
the problems with the money?

20:21.597 --> 20:24.058
N-no. Uh, Mrs. Westlake did.

20:25.921 --> 20:27.582
You spoke to Mrs. Westlake?

20:27.583 --> 20:29.403
She came to the club Wednesday morning.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.032
She said that she had figured it out,

20:32.033 --> 20:33.333
about Damian and me,

20:33.334 --> 20:35.032
and she wanted to warn me.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.860
About what?
Mrs.Westlake said that

20:36.861 --> 20:38.397
she was going to leave Damian,

20:38.398 --> 20:40.027
and then he wouldn't have any money.

20:40.028 --> 20:41.708
She said he couldn't live without money,

20:41.742 --> 20:43.074
so he would find someone else,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.978
you know, a woman who could support him.

20:44.979 --> 20:46.216
And did you tell Damian

20:46.217 --> 20:48.375
about the conversation
you had with his wife?

20:49.149 --> 20:51.150
And what did he say?

20:51.185 --> 20:53.119
He said he loved me

20:53.153 --> 20:55.989
and that nothing would keep us apart.

20:56.023 --> 20:59.158
Then I heard
about Mrs. Westlake on the news.

21:00.805 --> 21:01.701
Did you talk to Damian

21:01.702 --> 21:03.929
after you heard about his wife's murder?

21:04.190 --> 21:05.346
Just once.

21:06.286 --> 21:08.418
He said we couldn't see
each other for a while,

21:08.623 --> 21:10.337
until things calmed down.

21:11.102 --> 21:13.123
He told me that he didn't do it.

21:14.799 --> 21:16.846
But then he said, you
know, if the cops ask me,

21:16.847 --> 21:18.826
that I should say that
we weren't together...

21:19.767 --> 21:22.611
That it could make him look bad.

21:23.296 --> 21:24.947
What am I supposed to think?

21:35.394 --> 21:37.231
Callie's alibi checks out.

21:38.642 --> 21:40.896
She was at work on Wednesday
until 7:00 P.M.

21:40.897 --> 21:43.158
Uniforms are bringing Damian in now.

21:43.217 --> 21:44.117
Look...

21:45.482 --> 21:49.215
Maybe Damian is a cheater and
a bum and a bad husband.

21:49.216 --> 21:52.085
Maybe?
But that doesn't make him a killer.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.556
And you keep looking at me like
I'm crazy for believing in him,

21:55.557 --> 21:58.182
but that's just because you don't know him.

21:58.206 --> 21:59.862
Castle, neither do you.

22:00.331 --> 22:02.662
The Damian that you think you know

22:02.663 --> 22:04.432
doesn't exist.

22:04.460 --> 22:07.641
You made him up, just like
you made up Derrick Storm,

22:07.642 --> 22:10.608
just like you made up Nikki Heat.

22:10.609 --> 22:14.497
He's a character in a story
that you told yourself

22:14.498 --> 22:17.589
when you were a homesick
14-year-old little boy.

22:18.281 --> 22:20.149
Maybe it's time to let him go.

22:29.034 --> 22:30.829
You can watch from observation.

22:30.969 --> 22:32.669
You don't want to be in there for this.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.494
You know, people keep telling
me I should hire a lawyer.

22:44.820 --> 22:47.551
I say, I'm innocent.
I-I shouldn't need a lawyer.

22:47.707 --> 22:49.473
If you're innocent, Mr. Westlake, why is it

22:49.474 --> 22:52.371
every time I turn over a rock in this case,

22:52.372 --> 22:56.721
some dirty secret of yours slithers out?
I didn't do this.

22:56.722 --> 22:59.655
That's what you said to the
cops in Puerto Rico, too.

23:00.666 --> 23:02.522
Isn't funny how you keep finding yourself

23:02.523 --> 23:06.979
in the same situation,
telling the same stories?

23:07.216 --> 23:09.155
I've got a story, too.
You want to hear it?

23:09.200 --> 23:13.085
My story is about a handsome little prince

23:13.086 --> 23:15.101
who only ever wanted to live well,

23:15.102 --> 23:16.993
so he killed his dad, the king,

23:16.994 --> 23:21.060
and he stole all of his
gold, and he spent it

23:21.061 --> 23:23.762
and he spent it until it was all gone.

23:23.763 --> 23:26.191
I didn't marry Vicky for her money.

23:27.170 --> 23:28.321
I loved her.

23:28.322 --> 23:29.894
And what about Callie?

23:30.465 --> 23:32.194
That's right, Damian. We talked to her.

23:32.195 --> 23:34.815
She said that you were in love with her

23:34.819 --> 23:36.196
and that you told her

23:36.197 --> 23:39.403
that you wanted the two
of you to be together.

23:39.404 --> 23:41.326
Vicky was leaving you soon.

23:41.327 --> 23:44.104
You'd be free to have
your happily ever after.

23:44.105 --> 23:45.749
But there's just one problem.

23:46.137 --> 23:49.493
Once again... you were out of gold.

23:49.592 --> 23:51.784
Vicky stood between you and a fortune.

23:51.785 --> 23:54.984
And we know what happens to
people when they do that.

23:55.194 --> 23:57.239
You were the last one to see her alive.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.806
You were the only one with motive.

23:59.807 --> 24:01.489
But I didn't kill her!

24:17.094 --> 24:18.856
Damian Westlake, you are under arrest...

24:18.857 --> 24:20.622
You're making a mistake.
For the murder of Victoria Westlake.

24:20.623 --> 24:22.778
You have the right to remain silent.
I didn't do this.

24:23.214 --> 24:25.882
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot...

24:30.313 --> 24:31.814
Is Alexis up and gone already?

24:31.815 --> 24:34.895
Oh, yeah. She wanted to window shop
before her violin lesson.

24:34.896 --> 24:36.900
It's her first Valentine's Day with Ashley,

24:36.901 --> 24:39.817
and she's feeling the pressure.
Ah, yes.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.927
She wants a gift that says "I love you,"

24:42.928 --> 24:46.177
but nothing that says, "I love
you more than life itself.

24:46.178 --> 24:47.601
Please don't leave me or I may die."

24:47.602 --> 24:50.990
Well, that's why you guys go for
the chocolates and the flowers.

24:51.337 --> 24:53.661
I wish the choice I had to
make today was so simple.

24:53.668 --> 24:56.565
I realized, I have the choice to
believe in two terrible things.

24:56.566 --> 24:58.457
Either Damian is a killer

24:58.458 --> 25:00.502
or Beckett's arrested an innocent man.

25:02.114 --> 25:04.358
Just thinking about it's
making my head hurt.

25:04.497 --> 25:07.711
Well, then forget your head.
Listen to your heart.

25:25.913 --> 25:26.812
Ricky.

25:28.383 --> 25:30.627
I keep thinking back to
when I was a senior.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.176
You were off at Harvard.

25:32.177 --> 25:34.546
You'd send me pages you were
working on for your novel,

25:34.547 --> 25:36.391
and they were good, Damian.

25:36.517 --> 25:39.978
Man, you had talent.
Why'd you throw it away?

25:39.979 --> 25:42.880
Ah, you were the writer, Ricky, not me.

25:42.881 --> 25:44.353
I didn't have anything to say.

25:44.354 --> 25:45.539
After I inherited all that money,

25:45.540 --> 25:47.778
I just didn't even want to try anymore.

25:47.829 --> 25:49.772
But when I look back at my life,
I hope you won't mind

25:49.773 --> 25:53.623
if I list you as one of
my few accomplishments.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.981
You should've told me about Callie.

25:59.403 --> 26:02.910
I swear to you, I didn't kill my wife.

26:06.409 --> 26:07.318
All right.

26:07.467 --> 26:09.729
Can you think of anything
we might have overlooked,

26:09.730 --> 26:11.406
anything that might speak
to your innocence?

26:11.407 --> 26:13.979
I slept in, I went to the gym,

26:14.791 --> 26:16.553
I had lunch in a café on the West Side.

26:16.554 --> 26:18.488
When I got home, Vicky was already there.

26:18.489 --> 26:22.174
She had been to see Callie.
We fought... God... for hours.

26:22.175 --> 26:23.971
She said she wanted a divorce.

26:23.974 --> 26:26.126
Yeah, she... she showed me
an envelope

26:26.127 --> 26:27.798
and said there were papers
inside that her lawyer

26:27.799 --> 26:29.484
had drawn up for her to sign.

26:29.485 --> 26:31.405
She was gonna end the marriage.

26:32.090 --> 26:35.278
I begged her to reconsider,
and she asked me to leave.

26:35.913 --> 26:38.756
She needed to think.
You said Vicky gave you an envelope?

26:39.481 --> 26:40.613
What'd it look like?

26:42.678 --> 26:43.832
I gotta get back to my route.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.638
Just five minutes, I promise.

26:46.314 --> 26:47.991
Ah. Hello, hello.

26:47.992 --> 26:48.945
Castle?

26:48.946 --> 26:51.332
Everyone, this is Blanca.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.967
Hola. ¿Qué estás haciendo aquí?

26:52.968 --> 26:54.895
Este loco me hizo venir con él.

26:54.896 --> 26:57.759
Ah. Lo siento. Buena suerte.

26:57.864 --> 27:00.015
Yeah, I don't... I don't know what...

27:00.106 --> 27:01.862
So first of all,

27:02.633 --> 27:03.351
you were right.

27:03.352 --> 27:06.206
Damian and Vicky did have a
fight the night she died.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.806
And she did tell him she wanted a divorce.

27:08.807 --> 27:10.139
As a matter of fact,

27:10.270 --> 27:12.486
she showed him a large manila
envelope full of papers

27:12.487 --> 27:15.195
from her lawyer that she was going to sign.

27:15.196 --> 27:17.140
An envelope with legal papers?

27:17.141 --> 27:19.143
There wasn't anything about this
in the C.S.U. report.

27:19.144 --> 27:19.807
Exactly.

27:19.808 --> 27:22.354
Blanca, please tell them
what happened to it.

27:22.355 --> 27:24.696
Then I could go back to my route?
Yes, of course.

27:24.996 --> 27:27.028
I was delivering the mail
on Wednesday afternoon.

27:27.029 --> 27:29.420
As I made my way up 69th
towards Park, I passed

27:29.421 --> 27:31.538
Mr. Westlake and Mr. Utley.
I said hello.

27:31.539 --> 27:33.690
They said hello back.
A couple of minutes later,

27:33.691 --> 27:35.921
I get to the Westlakes' residence,
the door opens,

27:35.922 --> 27:37.947
and Mrs. Westlake comes running out
and hands me

27:37.948 --> 27:40.619
a large manila envelope.
She said she wanted to make sure

27:40.620 --> 27:43.034
it went out in that day's mail.
Wait a minute. So you're positive

27:43.035 --> 27:45.590
that you saw Mrs. Westlake
after you saw Damian?

27:45.591 --> 27:47.602
Lady, I couldn't be more sure.

27:47.790 --> 27:50.034
Anything else?
No, that's it. Thank you.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.758
Then I'm leaving now.
Of course.

27:52.510 --> 27:53.863
Thank you, Blanca.

27:56.912 --> 28:00.412
So... Vicky was alive after Damian
left the house.

28:00.413 --> 28:01.494
And he was with Charles Utley

28:01.495 --> 28:04.169
until they came back and found her dead.
Which means...

28:05.110 --> 28:06.675
Damian couldn't have killed her.

28:08.879 --> 28:09.829
Got it.

28:10.038 --> 28:12.303
The D.A.'s office just kicked
Damian Westlake loose.

28:12.304 --> 28:13.691
And they weren't too happy about it either.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.115
Sir, if Westlake didn't do it,

28:15.116 --> 28:17.005
then he hired someone
else to do it for him,

28:17.006 --> 28:19.432
just like he did the last time.
Wasn't it you that said

28:19.433 --> 28:21.182
that bad guys always
bring their own weapons?

28:21.183 --> 28:22.080
Not when they want it to look

28:22.081 --> 28:23.511
like a push-in robbery gone wrong.

28:23.512 --> 28:24.801
What about the dog that didn't bark?

28:24.802 --> 28:25.968
He got the dog used to the guy.

28:25.969 --> 28:27.888
Come on. You just can't get over the fact

28:27.889 --> 28:30.070
that Damian was a person of
interest in his father's murder.

28:30.071 --> 28:33.381
I won't ignore the fact that
there is a pattern here.

28:33.382 --> 28:35.846
People close to this guy
seem to die violently.

28:35.847 --> 28:38.151
Or maybe someone is using
Damian's tragic past

28:38.152 --> 28:39.742
to frame him for Vicky's murder.

28:39.743 --> 28:41.744
Now there's another suspect
right in front of you

28:41.745 --> 28:44.238
that you're not even looking at...
Someone who had motive,

28:44.239 --> 28:47.835
means, and opportunity.
And that would be whom exactly?

28:49.111 --> 28:50.348
Simon Campbell...

28:50.872 --> 28:52.066
Vicky's ex-husband.

28:52.067 --> 28:53.101
Think about it.

28:53.196 --> 28:56.320
Abandoned, cuckolded Simon...
Do we really know this guy?

28:56.321 --> 28:59.264
Do we have any idea what he's capable of?
Well, do we?

28:59.265 --> 29:00.867
All the evidence points to Damian.

29:00.868 --> 29:02.881
Yes, but wouldn't that
evidence be less conclusive

29:02.882 --> 29:05.469
if Damian didn't have this old
murder hanging over his head,

29:05.470 --> 29:08.021
or better yet, if there was
proof that Philip Westlake

29:08.022 --> 29:11.869
was killed by a random intruder?
Castle, there isn't any proof.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.427
Not yet, there isn't.

29:14.551 --> 29:16.595
Since you can't see through
the cloud of suspicion

29:16.596 --> 29:18.689
surrounding Damian, I'm
gonna clear the air.

29:18.917 --> 29:21.474
I'm gonna solve Philip Westlake's murder,

29:21.475 --> 29:22.451
prove my friend didn't do it.

29:22.452 --> 29:24.648
Meanwhile, you can check
out Simon Campbell.

29:26.411 --> 29:28.237
I need to go to the D.A.
with something solid.

29:28.238 --> 29:31.017
Can you prove Westlake hired
somebody to off his wife?

29:31.023 --> 29:32.642
I just need a couple of days.

29:37.207 --> 29:39.186
So what's our next move?

29:40.383 --> 29:41.667
If Damian hired someone to kill Vicky,

29:41.668 --> 29:42.858
then there's a money trail.

29:42.859 --> 29:43.808
I'll find it.

29:43.972 --> 29:46.008
Meanwhile, you guys look
into Simon Campbell.

29:48.158 --> 29:49.786
I'm sure he'll love it.

29:49.886 --> 29:53.645
Darling, your daughter's a genius.
I knew that already.

29:53.646 --> 29:56.578
For Valentine's Day,
she bought Ashley a frame,

29:56.579 --> 29:58.140
had it engraved "true love,"

29:58.141 --> 30:01.397
and put in a picture
of his pet rat... Theodore.

30:01.918 --> 30:04.579
Heartfelt yet humorous.
Genius.

30:05.622 --> 30:06.632
What's in the box?

30:06.633 --> 30:10.054
This is Philip Westlake's murder file.

30:10.121 --> 30:12.727
I told Beckett, I'm gonna solve the case.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.483
- Oh, Richard. - What? You're the one
who told me to follow my heart.

30:15.484 --> 30:18.460
Yes, but, you know...
Dad, that case is older than me.

30:18.461 --> 30:20.241
This doesn't sound like encouragement.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.808
Then would you like some help?

30:25.756 --> 30:26.801
Yes, I would.

30:29.054 --> 30:31.619
To hire a gunman, you need cash,

30:31.620 --> 30:33.946
and according to everything
that we've been through here,

30:33.947 --> 30:35.352
Damian didn't have any.
Yeah, well,

30:35.353 --> 30:36.758
it's somewhere.
We just haven't found it yet.

30:36.759 --> 30:38.502
All the expensive
knickknacks in that house,

30:38.503 --> 30:40.306
maybe he pawned a figurine.

30:40.307 --> 30:42.103
Vicky was a designer.
She was meticulous.

30:42.104 --> 30:43.732
She would've noticed if
something went missing,

30:43.733 --> 30:45.814
like the engagement ring.

30:47.731 --> 30:48.728
Got something?

30:49.835 --> 30:52.555
Omar Lincoln overheard
Vicky call Damian a thief,

30:52.556 --> 30:55.235
and when Vicky apologized to Morris Hasberg

30:55.236 --> 30:58.767
for accusing him of stealing her
engagement ring, she cried.

30:58.768 --> 31:00.375
Maybe she wasn't crying because of Morris.

31:00.376 --> 31:04.031
Maybe she was crying because
she realized that her husband

31:04.032 --> 31:07.089
was stealing from her.
C.S.U. said the ring was accounted for.

31:07.090 --> 31:11.118
- Vicky's credit card... wasn't there
an appraiser on it? - Yeah. Why?

31:11.571 --> 31:13.647
I think I know how Damian got his money.

31:13.666 --> 31:16.519
It was terrible, what happened
to Mrs. Westlake.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.673
She came to see you Tuesday afternoon.

31:18.674 --> 31:19.630
What for?

31:19.818 --> 31:21.941
Oh, she wanted her jewelry appraised.

31:22.019 --> 31:23.770
I'm afraid I had some bad news for her.

31:23.771 --> 31:27.168
The stones were imitation.
I see that quite a bit.

31:27.563 --> 31:28.588
People need cash in a hurry,

31:28.589 --> 31:30.102
but they don't want to
give up their jewelry.

31:30.103 --> 31:31.900
So they sell the diamonds
and they replace them

31:31.901 --> 31:33.723
with high-quality silicon carbide.

31:33.724 --> 31:36.629
Was one of the pieces an 11-carat
engagement ring?

31:36.630 --> 31:39.211
Yes, the entire basket
setting had been replaced.

31:39.359 --> 31:41.611
She said that's how she
knew something was wrong.

31:45.096 --> 31:46.506
This whole case file

31:46.507 --> 31:49.790
is just one long loop
leading back to Damian.

31:49.858 --> 31:51.916
Apparently, neighbors saw someone loitering

31:51.917 --> 31:54.361
outside the Westlake home
the night of the murder.

31:56.462 --> 31:57.568
Here's a sketch.

32:01.917 --> 32:02.603
What?

32:02.604 --> 32:04.328
Alexis, I know this guy.

32:16.546 --> 32:17.811
Detective Beckett.

32:18.951 --> 32:20.285
Could we talk for a moment?

32:20.824 --> 32:21.739
Sure.

32:24.168 --> 32:25.563
Have you come to apologize?

32:25.564 --> 32:26.457
No.

32:26.501 --> 32:27.780
At least you're honest.

32:28.462 --> 32:30.203
What can I do for you, detective?

32:31.046 --> 32:33.321
You could show me the diamonds
that you stole from Vicky.

32:34.845 --> 32:38.386
I spoke to Wallace Benner,
the jeweler on the West Side.

32:38.902 --> 32:39.653
He said that he replaced

32:39.654 --> 32:42.070
your wife's diamonds with imitation ones.

32:42.071 --> 32:43.815
Over a period of several weeks,

32:43.816 --> 32:48.632
he exchanged 26 diamonds
worth over $8 million

32:48.633 --> 32:50.168
and gave you the real ones.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.228
But doesn't this argue against your theory

32:52.415 --> 32:53.876
that I killed my wife?

32:53.952 --> 32:57.822
If I have $8 million,
why wouldn't I just leave,

32:57.823 --> 32:59.713
be with Callie?
Greed.

32:59.714 --> 33:01.709
You used the first diamond
as a down payment

33:01.710 --> 33:02.903
for the contract to kill her.

33:02.904 --> 33:06.324
Once Vicky was dead, you'd inherit
and double your take.

33:06.865 --> 33:08.966
You really think I'm that cold?

33:09.056 --> 33:10.765
Personally, I have no doubt.

33:13.671 --> 33:15.505
But Richard Castle believes in you,

33:15.506 --> 33:17.131
and I believe in him.

33:17.333 --> 33:18.820
So show me those diamonds.

33:18.821 --> 33:21.395
Show me that none of them are missing

33:21.396 --> 33:24.046
or I will haul your ass back to jail.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.032
I only changed the
diamonds I had given her.

33:44.033 --> 33:46.269
Those pieces cost me millions of dollars,

33:46.270 --> 33:49.154
and I knew she'd have no
particular attachment to them

33:49.807 --> 33:51.083
once we were over.

33:51.272 --> 33:52.363
I've led....

33:53.965 --> 33:57.250
A careless and wasteful life, detective.

33:58.150 --> 33:59.418
But I'm no killer.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.259
26 diamonds... They're all there.

34:05.214 --> 34:06.395
Detective Salazar?

34:06.823 --> 34:08.426
I'm Richard Castle.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.382
Thank you very much for meeting me.

34:10.384 --> 34:12.257
I'm retired now, so you can call me Ray.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.802
All right. So, Ray, what kind of man

34:15.803 --> 34:16.969
leaves beautiful Puerto Rico

34:16.969 --> 34:19.194
to retire in freezing cold New York?

34:20.011 --> 34:21.728
The kind of man whose beautiful wife

34:21.728 --> 34:23.025
is from Long Island.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.139
Understood. So you said on the phone

34:25.139 --> 34:28.024
this was about the Philip Westlake case?
That's right.

34:28.074 --> 34:31.159
I really hated leaving the job
with that one still unsolved.

34:31.348 --> 34:32.815
Well, maybe I can help with that.

34:34.043 --> 34:36.768
Did you ever manage to identify
the man that neighbors saw

34:36.770 --> 34:37.754
outside the Westlake home

34:37.755 --> 34:39.735
the night of the murder?
Thought we did.

34:39.735 --> 34:41.235
He looked a lot like a local tough

34:41.237 --> 34:43.025
named Enrique Molina.

34:43.027 --> 34:44.074
But when we brought Molina in,

34:44.074 --> 34:45.818
the neighbors couldn't
pick him out of a lineup.

34:45.819 --> 34:47.409
That's because it wasn't Molina.

34:54.594 --> 34:56.281
I'm listening.
Michael Rutherford

34:56.282 --> 34:58.230
was a scholarship kid
at Edgewyck Academy,

34:58.231 --> 35:00.543
where Damian Westlake and I went to school.

35:00.690 --> 35:04.000
He was smart, but... a sociopath,

35:04.090 --> 35:05.150
a thief.

35:05.234 --> 35:06.789
Kid barely graduated.

35:07.434 --> 35:08.920
Were Rutherford and Westlake friends?

35:08.921 --> 35:11.101
No. As a matter of fact,
it was Damian who turned him in

35:11.102 --> 35:12.893
to the headmaster for stealing.

35:12.894 --> 35:15.224
But they did run in some
of the same circles,

35:15.225 --> 35:16.975
sometimes went to the same parties.

35:16.976 --> 35:20.444
What if Michael Rutherford heard

35:20.562 --> 35:22.679
about the Westlake vacation
home in Puerto Rico?

35:22.680 --> 35:25.841
It was nearly always
vacant, full of treasure.

35:25.842 --> 35:27.004
He could've made a small fortune

35:27.005 --> 35:29.733
and gotten revenge on
Damian at the same time.

35:32.601 --> 35:33.636
Hey, how'd it go?

35:34.447 --> 35:37.411
Damian Westlake is a thief and a cheater...

35:37.850 --> 35:39.942
But he might not be our killer.

35:40.137 --> 35:42.749
You guys, I hate admitting it,
but Castle might be right.

35:43.985 --> 35:47.012
We've also been thinking
that Castle might be right.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.108
Info's back on Simon Campbell.

35:50.001 --> 35:52.829
Vicky's ex-husband is
what they like to call "overextended."

35:52.857 --> 35:55.656
Campbell's real estate firm
took a big hit two years ago,

35:55.657 --> 35:57.533
and he borrowed heavily to cover costs.

35:57.534 --> 36:00.997
The man needs a cash transfusion, stat.
Is Simon in Vicky's will?

36:00.998 --> 36:02.401
He gets the deed to the Brownstone,

36:02.402 --> 36:03.874
which is worth over $5 million.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.804
He's also the executor of
their children's estate.

36:05.805 --> 36:08.114
Now he was at home with the
kids at the time of the murder,

36:08.115 --> 36:10.307
but he was on the second floor,
and they were on the third.

36:10.308 --> 36:12.853
So he could've snuck out,
been back before anyone noticed.

36:12.854 --> 36:14.669
Which brings us to the Campbell Brownstone

36:14.670 --> 36:17.356
and its very sophisticated security system.

36:17.357 --> 36:19.884
It records every door opening,
every window.

36:19.885 --> 36:21.292
A friendly A.D.A. got us a warrant,

36:21.293 --> 36:23.128
and we talked to the alarm company.

36:23.477 --> 36:26.769
37 P.M. on Wednesday, the front door opens.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.108
At 5:42, it opened again.

36:29.109 --> 36:30.829
Which means someone left before the murder

36:30.830 --> 36:32.213
and then returned after.

36:32.214 --> 36:34.988
You know, I'd like to talk
to our Mr. Simon Campbell.

36:34.989 --> 36:36.408
Well, we called his place.

36:36.409 --> 36:38.256
He's out all evening on personal business

36:38.257 --> 36:41.031
and he's not picking up his cell phone.
Okay, sit on his house.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.663
When he gets back home, bring him in.
Mm.

36:45.593 --> 36:46.968
So... what did you decide about Lanie

36:46.969 --> 36:48.383
and Valentine's Day?

36:49.386 --> 36:53.046
Oh. I'm gonna play it safe
and show up with a gift.

36:53.949 --> 36:56.710
I found this jewelry store
that sells stuff, you know,

36:56.987 --> 36:59.870
that girlfriends like...
necklaces, charm bracelets.

36:59.871 --> 37:02.750
What about you? What are you gonna do?
Oh, Jenny loves chocolate.

37:02.751 --> 37:04.803
Jenny's planning her wedding.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.110
Your girl's on a diet,

37:07.111 --> 37:08.065
and you're gonna give her chocolate?

37:08.066 --> 37:10.239
Hey, hey, hey. It's Simon.

37:11.955 --> 37:14.252
Oh, and he's got a little
Valentine of his own,

37:14.253 --> 37:15.236
doesn't he?

37:16.903 --> 37:19.811
Is that Amber Patinelli,
Vicky Westlake's employee?

37:19.875 --> 37:21.023
You're sure it's her?

37:22.098 --> 37:23.059
So much for Simon saying

37:23.060 --> 37:25.209
that he wanted to reconcile with Vicky.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.280
What do you want us to do?

37:28.563 --> 37:29.534
Thought so.

37:29.603 --> 37:30.909
Let's bring 'em both in.

37:36.915 --> 37:38.541
I was hoping you'd still be here.

37:38.832 --> 37:40.482
I was just about to call you.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.227
I think I know who the killer is.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.800
I appreciate you coming in.
Detective, it's very late.

37:56.801 --> 37:59.072
Oh, this will be quick.
I didn't realize

37:59.073 --> 38:01.765
that the two of you were a couple.
Well, it's very casual.

38:01.766 --> 38:04.093
Well, for a long time,
we were just friends.

38:04.094 --> 38:06.955
I was a shoulder to cry
on after the divorce.

38:07.063 --> 38:09.825
It's been only been recently that, uh...

38:10.998 --> 38:14.123
Any plans for Valentine's Day?
Uh, nothing special, no.

38:14.124 --> 38:16.129
You were hoping to spend
it with Vicky, right?

38:18.460 --> 38:19.536
What does that mean?

38:21.124 --> 38:21.651
Simon?

38:21.652 --> 38:24.766
Uh, Vicky and I have been talking.
That's all.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.682
How is this relevant to
anything, detective?

38:26.683 --> 38:28.375
Did Vicky know about you and Amber?

38:28.376 --> 38:30.312
No. I didn't want her to know.

38:30.313 --> 38:33.051
So it's possible that
Vicky innocently confided

38:33.052 --> 38:35.236
in her friend Amber, telling her
she was leaving Damian,

38:35.237 --> 38:38.577
going back to Simon,
not knowing that he was your Simon now.

38:38.578 --> 38:41.310
Amber, you called for a company car at 4:15

38:41.311 --> 38:42.933
on Wednesday afternoon.

38:42.934 --> 38:44.444
We just talked to the dispatcher.

38:44.445 --> 38:47.924
He says you ordered a sedan
and kept it for an hour,

38:47.925 --> 38:51.144
a round-trip to the Westlakes' and back.

38:51.941 --> 38:53.409
We found a nail gun

38:53.638 --> 38:56.065
with fingerprints that
we couldn't identify.

38:56.518 --> 38:59.307
If we compare them to yours,
do you think we'd find a match?

39:03.173 --> 39:05.436
You didn't go there intending
to kill her, did you?

39:05.710 --> 39:06.657
No.

39:08.412 --> 39:10.304
I just wanted to talk.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.890
She could have any man she wanted.

39:13.406 --> 39:15.992
And I begged her to let me have you.

39:19.237 --> 39:20.458
She said no.

39:22.045 --> 39:23.617
I love you so much.

39:24.526 --> 39:27.082
She could never love you the way that I do.

39:34.607 --> 39:37.562
So you're saying that Amber
didn't even know about my past?

39:37.576 --> 39:40.902
It wasn't a frame, just
a strange coincidence?

39:40.903 --> 39:42.050
Or kismet.

39:43.885 --> 39:45.130
Where are you off to?

39:46.238 --> 39:47.330
Barcelona.

39:47.757 --> 39:49.009
I gotta get away.

39:50.648 --> 39:52.706
Thank detective Beckett for me, will ya?

39:52.863 --> 39:55.001
Congratulate her on solving the case.

39:55.182 --> 39:57.171
Well, actually, we solved two cases.

39:59.789 --> 40:00.810
What's this?

40:01.877 --> 40:03.676
That's a sketch of Michael Rutherford.

40:03.677 --> 40:05.840
I found it in your father's murder file.

40:05.841 --> 40:07.218
Michael Rutherford?

40:07.353 --> 40:08.421
From school?

40:09.842 --> 40:11.087
I don't understand.

40:11.194 --> 40:14.550
He broke into your house.
He shot your father.

40:16.482 --> 40:17.583
Oh, my God.

40:18.681 --> 40:21.597
They found him, Damian.
He's been arrested.

40:21.939 --> 40:23.314
After all this time?

40:25.327 --> 40:26.908
Can they even prove that he did it?

40:26.909 --> 40:29.394
There was a cigarette
butt left at the scene.

40:29.395 --> 40:31.385
Detective Salazar made
sure it was preserved.

40:31.386 --> 40:34.334
The D.N.A. is a match.

40:35.272 --> 40:37.053
Michael made a deal, Damian.

40:38.239 --> 40:39.428
He confessed.

40:42.904 --> 40:44.181
Wow. This is, uh...

40:45.225 --> 40:46.781
It's pretty overwhelming.

40:48.063 --> 40:48.985
I got a plane to catch,

40:48.986 --> 40:50.973
so maybe we should just
talk about this later.

40:50.974 --> 40:53.209
Michael told the cops you
got in touch with him,

40:54.627 --> 40:55.534
asked him if he wanted to make

40:55.535 --> 40:57.547
a lot of money for one night's work.

40:57.863 --> 41:00.821
You gave him your Rolex
and your car as a down payment.

41:00.822 --> 41:01.844
When your inheritance came through,

41:01.845 --> 41:03.572
he got half a million dollars

41:04.022 --> 41:06.019
and a one-way ticket to Los Angeles.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.858
He still has your Rolex...

41:10.357 --> 41:12.427
And a map that you drew

41:13.461 --> 41:15.050
of your father's house

41:16.220 --> 41:18.312
with a path leading
straight to his bedroom.

41:18.464 --> 41:20.029
Rick, he's lying.
He's lying.

41:20.030 --> 41:21.538
Tell me you didn't do it.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.661
Ricky, I...

41:23.662 --> 41:26.572
Tell me I haven't been
believing in you all this time

41:26.573 --> 41:27.578
for nothing.

41:32.677 --> 41:33.706
That's them...

41:35.668 --> 41:38.179
Detective Salazar and
some New York detectives.

41:38.372 --> 41:39.721
They're here to take you in.

41:44.991 --> 41:46.682
I told them you'd be a gentleman.

41:57.810 --> 42:00.378
Show me a hero, and I'll
write you a tragedy.

42:00.974 --> 42:02.772
F. Scott Fitzgerald said that.

42:02.906 --> 42:04.713
Then it must have been
Ernest Hemingway who said,

42:04.714 --> 42:08.432
"Man, I sure could use
a drink right about now."

42:09.052 --> 42:11.192
Lead the way. I'm buying.

42:12.452 --> 42:13.808
It's Valentine's Day.

42:14.597 --> 42:16.785
Shouldn't you be in a
nice candlelit restaurant

42:16.803 --> 42:18.758
wearing a new dress ordering surf and turf?

42:18.759 --> 42:20.188
I've got a couple of hours.

42:20.776 --> 42:21.772
You okay?

42:22.471 --> 42:23.645
Yeah. I'm fine.

42:26.141 --> 42:27.018
Liar.

42:27.218 --> 42:37.418
