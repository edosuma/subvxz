<i>So, Here is what you missed on
Glee: Quinn's got a new look,</i>

00:02.545 --> 00:04.096
<i>and a new crowd of Skanks.
Kurt got Blaine to join</i>

00:04.180 --> 00:06.431
<i>the New Directions, which is
good, because Santana got</i>

00:06.516 --> 00:08.517
<i>kicked out, and Sugar Motta wasn't good
enough to get in. Who cares what you think?</i>

00:08.568 --> 00:10.235
<i>McKinley's doing West Side
Story, and Kurt and Rachel</i>

00:10.320 --> 00:11.687
<i>need the leads
so they can get into NYADA.</i>

00:11.738 --> 00:13.155
<i>Sue's using her
run for Congress</i>

00:13.222 --> 00:14.523
<i>to come after the arts.
Believe it or not,</i>

00:14.574 --> 00:15.991
<i>still not
a big fan of the Glee Club.</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:17.693

on Glee.</i>

00:26.135 --> 00:28.470
I really like your outfit.

00:28.537 --> 00:30.205
And I think you're,
like, fabulous,

00:30.256 --> 00:31.807
and I just love
everything that you do.

00:31.874 --> 00:33.809
Why, thank you, Brit.

00:33.876 --> 00:35.877
Okay, I really want to run
your campaign for president.

00:37.230 --> 00:39.648
Out of all the kids at the
school, I think that you

00:39.715 --> 00:40.932
are the biggest unicorn.
I'm sorry?

00:41.017 --> 00:43.318
Well, when a pony does
a good deed, he gets a horn,

00:43.385 --> 00:45.987
and he, he becomes a unicorn,
and he poops out cotton candy,

00:46.055 --> 00:48.056
until he forgets he's magical.

00:48.107 --> 00:50.442
And then his horn falls off.

00:50.526 --> 00:52.160
And black unicorns,
they becomes zebras.

00:52.228 --> 00:54.696
Oh, that's... that's
a terrifying story.

00:54.747 --> 00:55.780
No, it's not.

00:55.865 --> 00:57.282
No, okay. No.

00:57.366 --> 00:59.734
The point is, is that...

00:59.785 --> 01:02.403
a unicorn is sebody who
knows they're magical,

01:02.455 --> 01:04.089
and isn't afraid to show it.

01:04.173 --> 01:05.456
You went through
hell last year,

01:05.541 --> 01:08.293
and you never forgot
how special you were.

01:08.377 --> 01:10.962
And I've slept with a lot of
people, and am really popular,

01:11.047 --> 01:13.081
so I think I could
get you mega votes.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.883
Then why don't
you just run?

01:14.934 --> 01:16.417
I'm not smart enough.

01:16.469 --> 01:18.220
What's the capital of Ohio?

01:18.271 --> 01:19.971
Brittany.
O.

01:20.056 --> 01:21.256
What?

01:21.307 --> 01:22.557
Do you even know who
the president is?

01:22.608 --> 01:24.109
Will. i.am.

01:25.945 --> 01:29.264
Well, Brit, I have to say
that I'm, I'm flattered.

01:29.315 --> 01:31.766
And really excited.

01:31.817 --> 01:33.702
Cool. Okay, I'll come
over after school,

01:33.769 --> 01:35.103
and we'll work on
your campaign posters.

01:35.154 --> 01:36.655
I got a lot of great ideas.

01:36.739 --> 01:38.439
Great. Great, uh...
I'll see you then.

01:38.491 --> 01:39.508
Sweet.

01:39.509 --> 01:42.839
Synced By YesCool
www. addic7ed. com

01:42.874 --> 01:44.579
All right, New Directions!

01:44.630 --> 01:47.165
Big news. As you all know,

01:47.250 --> 01:49.117
Vocal Adrenaline came in
second last year at Nationals.

01:49.168 --> 01:50.835
The only good thing to come
out of that lost weekend.

01:52.454 --> 01:53.889
Besides us getting
back together.

01:53.956 --> 01:55.623
Well, the boosters at Carmel

01:55.675 --> 01:57.309
don't donate tens of
thousands of dollars

01:57.393 --> 01:58.643
every year to come in second.

01:58.728 --> 02:01.179
So they fired Dustin Goolsby-
So handsome.

02:01.264 --> 02:03.565
and they're having trouble
finding a new coach.

02:03.632 --> 02:05.267
Seems that no one wants to
take on that pressure cooker.

02:05.318 --> 02:06.768
That means they're vulnerable.

02:06.819 --> 02:09.187
Yes. And if we work hard
enough, we can beat them.

02:09.271 --> 02:11.106
Which is why I've
realized that, um...

02:11.157 --> 02:13.474
I can't direct the
musical this year.

02:13.526 --> 02:15.493
But, Mr. Shue, you can't
cancel the musical.

02:15.578 --> 02:16.978
My New York dreams
depend on it.

02:17.029 --> 02:19.080
I'm not cancelling it,
I'm just not directing it.

02:19.148 --> 02:20.448
My sole focus has
to be in here.

02:20.499 --> 02:22.367
Nationals,
Nationals, Nationals.

02:22.451 --> 02:24.169
And it's not just me
that's going to have to

02:24.253 --> 02:26.204
focus harder this year.
I've been too easy on you.

02:26.289 --> 02:28.656
So every day
after choir practice

02:28.708 --> 02:32.344
I'm instituting a mandatory
"Booty Camp,"

02:32.428 --> 02:34.296
so that we can work
on our dancing.

02:34.347 --> 02:36.331
Now, it's not for all of you-
just the people that

02:36.382 --> 02:38.166
I think need help. Like...

02:38.217 --> 02:39.834
Finn.
How did you know?

02:39.885 --> 02:42.053
And Puckerman, Hummel.
I must protest.

02:42.138 --> 02:44.306
You kind of have one move, Kurt.
It's like this...

02:44.357 --> 02:46.524
sashay,
and it's super distracting.

02:46.609 --> 02:48.643
Jones.
What?

02:48.694 --> 02:51.680
Hell to the nizzy-no. You
told me once you were Beyonce.

02:51.747 --> 02:54.649
You don't think she spends
extra time in the dance studio?

02:54.700 --> 02:56.735
Mike Chang has offered
to be my assistant.

02:56.819 --> 03:00.455
And we start tomorrow and yes,
Puckerman, it is mandatory.

03:00.522 --> 03:03.358
Mr. Schuester, would you mind if
I dropped by for a little bit?

03:03.409 --> 03:05.460
I really need to catch up with
you guys. Okay, Mr. Shue, I'm glad

03:05.527 --> 03:07.028
that you're so concerned with
our special needs members,

03:07.079 --> 03:09.331
but what about me? Okay? Who's
going to direct the musical?

03:09.382 --> 03:12.167
Ladies and gentleman-
your co-musical directors,

03:12.218 --> 03:13.969
Ms. Pillsbury and
Coach Beiste.

03:14.036 --> 03:17.138
Now, Ms. Pillsbury did such
a good job helping me out

03:17.206 --> 03:18.590
with Rocky Horror
last year that

03:18.674 --> 03:20.008
I knew she could
handle the job.

03:20.059 --> 03:22.010
And I'm here to keep the
football guys in line.

03:22.061 --> 03:24.179
I've also talked them
into playing the "Jets. "

03:24.230 --> 03:25.847
Mr. Shue, with all due
respect to Ms. Pillsbury

03:25.898 --> 03:28.149
and Coach Beiste, this is crazy.
They have absolutely

03:28.217 --> 03:30.885
zero experience in directing
a musical. Not true.

03:30.936 --> 03:32.821
<i>In college, I was in
A Funny Thing Happened</i>

03:32.888 --> 03:34.722
<i>on the Way to the Forum.
I played the Forum.</i>

03:34.774 --> 03:36.191
The teachers at this school

03:36.242 --> 03:37.558
are already overworked and

03:37.610 --> 03:39.394
unfortunately a lot of them
agree with Sue that

03:39.445 --> 03:41.363
the arts are a waste of time.

03:41.414 --> 03:43.748
Besides, they are going
to have some help.

03:43.833 --> 03:46.785
I've decided to include a
student director this year.

03:46.869 --> 03:48.736
Mr. Shue, I'm honored,
but Barbra was 40

03:48.788 --> 03:51.339
<i>when she directed herself
in Yentl, so it's just,</i>

03:51.407 --> 03:52.957
it's too soon.
I hate you.

03:53.042 --> 03:55.543
I was actually hoping that
Artie would take the job.

03:55.594 --> 03:57.095
Me?

03:57.179 --> 04:00.015
I've developed my whole persona
around conflict avoidance.

04:00.082 --> 04:01.182
Come on, Artie,
you've made short films,

04:01.250 --> 04:02.934
directing is your dream.
You can do it.

04:07.256 --> 04:08.773
I'm in.

04:08.858 --> 04:10.591
All right.

04:23.122 --> 04:24.989
You still make
a mean cup of coffee?

04:25.074 --> 04:27.659
Shelby.

04:27.743 --> 04:29.244
What are you-
what are you doing here?

04:29.295 --> 04:30.445
It's the teachers'
lounge, isn't it?

04:32.164 --> 04:34.549
It's where all the
teachers hang out.

04:34.616 --> 04:36.384
Yeah...

04:36.452 --> 04:38.420
I'm a teacher here now.

04:38.471 --> 04:39.921
Well, part-time.

04:39.972 --> 04:41.956
You ever hear of this
guy named Al Motta?

04:42.007 --> 04:44.459
Mr. Motta, just so I'm clear,

04:44.510 --> 04:46.010
in exchange for this
very generous donation

04:46.095 --> 04:48.813
all I have to do is hire Ms.
Corcoran to start a second

04:48.898 --> 04:51.099
show choir at McKinley which
features your daughter?

04:51.150 --> 04:53.735
For which I will cover
any and all expenses.

04:53.802 --> 04:57.355
My Sugar's
a Super Nova, Figgy.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.524
You have a deal.
Mrs. Denny-Brown!

04:59.608 --> 05:02.277
Mr. Motta has just ended
our toilet paper shortage

05:02.328 --> 05:03.978
with this enormous check!

05:04.046 --> 05:05.530
Wipe away!

05:05.614 --> 05:08.583
They actually sent a headhunter
to track me down in New York.

05:08.650 --> 05:13.321
Apparently I am the best show
choir director money can buy.

05:13.372 --> 05:17.008
Don't worry, I'm not going
to poach any of your kids.

05:17.093 --> 05:19.210
I'm less worried about that
than about the fact that

05:19.295 --> 05:22.663
you being here is going to
be really hard on Rachel.

05:22.715 --> 05:23.664
I appreciate that.

05:23.716 --> 05:25.850
I plan on reaching out to her.

05:28.053 --> 05:29.471
What about Puck and Quinn?

05:29.522 --> 05:31.639
Lima's where I made
a series of mistakes

05:31.690 --> 05:33.391
that defined me
for 16 years.

05:33.476 --> 05:35.727
Lima's where I... I have to
make things right again.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.064
I know that seems impossible,
but I have to try.

05:41.450 --> 05:42.734
Okay.

05:42.818 --> 05:44.202
I will take you at your word.

05:44.286 --> 05:47.038
But as for your
little Glee Club...

05:48.541 --> 05:50.125
...the more arts at this
school the better.

05:50.192 --> 05:53.861
So, may the best
Glee Club win.

05:56.365 --> 05:57.549
We will.

06:02.221 --> 06:05.056
Give us your lunch money.

06:05.141 --> 06:07.041
We're hungry. We need
something to barf back up.

06:07.092 --> 06:08.593
Don't test me.

06:08.677 --> 06:12.063
I was a foster kid, which means
I'm used to stabbing people.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.050
You're so mean...

06:16.101 --> 06:18.553
That's right. It's what
passed for love in my house.

06:25.361 --> 06:28.112
Skanks, I've got to
talk to that lady alone.

06:30.749 --> 06:34.085
First of all, smoking kills.

06:34.170 --> 06:36.904
Second, it really does make
you look cooler, doesn't it?

06:36.956 --> 06:39.257
Sorry, Coach,

06:39.341 --> 06:40.908
but you have no
power over me anymore,

06:40.960 --> 06:42.877
'cause I've got
nothing left to lose.

06:42.928 --> 06:46.548
Oh, Q, I look at you
and I'm stunned.

06:46.599 --> 06:49.434
You've never looked worse.

06:49.518 --> 06:52.136
You've lost your child,
your boyfriend, your rep,

06:52.221 --> 06:54.939
and worse, your high pony.
You know who I blame?

06:55.024 --> 06:56.924
The Glee Club.

06:56.976 --> 06:58.226
You know, when you
were in my grasp,

06:58.277 --> 06:59.594
you were at the
top of the pyramid.

06:59.645 --> 07:02.313
But then you joined the
Glee Club, and became lost,

07:02.398 --> 07:04.566
forced to sway
in the background.

07:04.617 --> 07:07.368
Will Schuester never did
appreciate the gentle tremble

07:07.436 --> 07:08.786
of your thin,
forgettable alto.

07:08.871 --> 07:10.538
Thanks.

07:10.606 --> 07:12.773
What if I were to
offer you the chance

07:12.825 --> 07:15.376
to get revenge on the Glee
Club and become a star?

07:15.444 --> 07:18.213
My Congressional campaign
is producing a video:

07:18.280 --> 07:22.083
a day in the life of a girl from
whom the arts stole everything.

07:23.785 --> 07:25.620
And I think I've found my girl.

07:27.089 --> 07:29.340
First, a few demands.

07:29.425 --> 07:32.460
I need thrift store couches
under the bleachers.

07:32.511 --> 07:33.811
I've realized that
after smoking all day,

07:33.896 --> 07:34.929
it hurts to stand.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.147
Fair enough.

07:36.232 --> 07:38.132
Quinn Fabray,
you have a deal.

07:44.607 --> 07:46.991
Okay. We're going to make
100,000 copies

07:47.076 --> 07:49.077
of each poster.
And then...

07:49.144 --> 07:51.579
We'll ve each student
a swag bag full of this:

07:51.647 --> 07:55.950
We're going to call it "Kurt
Hummel's Bulging Pink Fun Sack. "

07:57.670 --> 08:00.705
Well, I... you know,
I don't know what to say.

08:00.789 --> 08:02.340
That happens to me all the time.

08:02.424 --> 08:04.709
My lips move, but
only dust comes out.

08:04.793 --> 08:07.378
You know, I appreciate
the enthusiasm.

08:07.463 --> 08:10.098
But... you know,
it's just all wrong.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.216
I think it's just,
you know, a tad too...

08:12.301 --> 08:13.885
Unicorn?
Gay.

08:13.969 --> 08:15.770
I feel like I might
as well have a big

08:15.837 --> 08:17.889
neon sign above my head
that says, you know,

08:17.973 --> 08:20.108
"GAY-DIDDY-GAY, GAY GAY-GAY-GAY!" I
mean, you'll need a long extension cord,

08:20.175 --> 08:21.893
but I love it.
I'm joking.

08:21.977 --> 08:24.178
Well, next time
you make a joke,

08:24.229 --> 08:26.180
nudge me in the ribs or, like,
honk a horn or something.

08:26.231 --> 08:28.700
Look, I don't just want
to be known as, you know,

08:28.784 --> 08:30.702
"Kurt Hummel, Homo. "

08:30.786 --> 08:32.019
What's wrong with that?

08:32.071 --> 08:35.039
Look, 99% of
the kids at the school

08:35.124 --> 08:36.374
are either freaks,
or closet freaks.

08:36.457 --> 08:39.544
The captain of the football
squad, he gets the job,

08:39.628 --> 08:40.745
but he doesn't
represent the people.

08:40.828 --> 08:42.196
That's why we
need a unicorn.

08:42.246 --> 08:44.198
And I agree with the sentiment,

08:44.249 --> 08:46.584
I just want something,
you know, toned down a tad.

08:46.669 --> 08:49.053
I came up with a
campaign poster, too.

08:49.138 --> 08:50.421
Okay?
Okay.

08:53.726 --> 08:56.210
Ta-da! Hmm?

08:56.261 --> 08:58.045
It's understated,
yet elegant.

08:58.097 --> 09:01.399
Inspired, of course, by the
classic Blackglama fur coat ads.

09:01.483 --> 09:03.685
Rumor has it that
Judy Garland-

09:03.736 --> 09:05.770
down on her luck and
thin as a baby bird-

09:05.854 --> 09:09.273
stole her Blackglama mink coat
after her photo shoot.

09:09.358 --> 09:11.326
And it wasn't
even lined yet.

09:11.393 --> 09:14.028
You should tell that story
during your campaign speech.

09:14.079 --> 09:16.080
It's like... so unicorn.

09:17.249 --> 09:19.734
I don't have time for this.

09:19.785 --> 09:21.169
Gotta meet the
Skanks on the roof.

09:21.236 --> 09:24.339
Gonna throw ketchup-covered
tampons at the marching band.

09:30.912 --> 09:32.964
You're back.
Yeah, I went to New York.

09:33.048 --> 09:35.266
Thought I'd do it all,
the whole working mother thing.

09:35.351 --> 09:39.771
But when I was in rehearsal,
even... even performing,

09:39.855 --> 09:42.106
I couldn't stop
thinking about Beth.

09:42.191 --> 09:45.560
How I could miss her
milestones, you know?

09:45.611 --> 09:48.279
Her first steps,
first words...

09:48.364 --> 09:49.981
first arabesque.
I get it.

09:52.768 --> 09:56.070
So when I got this job offer,
I couldn't refuse.

09:56.121 --> 09:57.772
I've missed so many
firsts in Rachel's life.

09:57.823 --> 09:59.490
I was not about to
do that with Beth.

09:59.575 --> 10:00.792
Neat story,

10:00.876 --> 10:02.877
but I'm late for
a meeting on the roof.

10:02.944 --> 10:04.579
Quinn, just listen to her.
Hey. Look.

10:04.630 --> 10:07.465
Since the day that I gave
Rachel up for adoption,

10:07.549 --> 10:09.250
I have been walking through life

10:09.301 --> 10:12.003
searching for her face
everywhere I go.

10:12.087 --> 10:14.889
Imagining what she's doing,
what she may be like...

10:14.956 --> 10:16.974
I don't want you to go
through what I went through.

10:17.059 --> 10:19.177
Part of me is-is
back here because...

10:19.261 --> 10:20.812
because I want you
to get to know Beth.

10:20.896 --> 10:23.064
I want you to be
a part of her life.

10:23.131 --> 10:26.367
When do I get to see her?

10:26.435 --> 10:28.803
Are you okay?
What's going on with you?

10:28.854 --> 10:30.188
Are you even in Glee anymore?

10:30.272 --> 10:31.489
Did you come here
just to torment me

10:31.573 --> 10:32.857
with the idea of
seeing my child?

10:32.941 --> 10:35.943
Look. I want you to be
a part of Beth's life.

10:35.994 --> 10:37.995
But not like this.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.914
If you're really
serious about Beth,

10:39.982 --> 10:42.533
clean up your act. You think
you can tell me what to do?

10:42.618 --> 10:44.535
Just cause you signed
a couple of papers?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.671
You're not her mom!
I'm her mom!

10:46.755 --> 10:47.988
Quinn...
Me! So...

10:48.040 --> 10:51.325
You can pretend
all you want,

10:51.376 --> 10:54.558
but that is something you
are never going to be.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.344
Listen, Mr. Shue,
I'm all for participating,

11:13.428 --> 11:15.012
but Shay says I'm more
of a park and bark

11:15.096 --> 11:16.547
and I tend to agree.

11:16.631 --> 11:17.848
A what and what?

11:17.932 --> 11:19.967
Park and bark-
I stand center stage

11:20.018 --> 11:21.518
singing the notes
no one else can

11:21.603 --> 11:23.170
while all of you guys
dance around me.

11:23.221 --> 11:25.389
Booty Camp is about
all of you dancing, Mercedes.

11:25.473 --> 11:26.523
In unison.

11:26.608 --> 11:27.941
I mean, look at
Vocal Adrenaline.

11:28.009 --> 11:30.110
When they're in synch-
one big terrifying machine,

11:30.178 --> 11:32.196
they're unstoppable.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.281
Mike, do your thing.
Let's go.

11:34.348 --> 11:36.817
The jazz square, the grapevine,
step-touch,

11:36.868 --> 11:39.403
the kick ball change,
and pivot.

11:39.487 --> 11:42.156
We perfect these basics,
we'll win Nationals.

11:42.207 --> 11:43.540
Grapevine to
the right.

11:43.625 --> 11:44.825
Five, six, seven, eight.

11:44.876 --> 11:46.526
Keep it going.

11:46.578 --> 11:48.712
I- am- in- hell.

11:48.797 --> 11:50.497
I'm going to put
my light under a bushel,

11:50.548 --> 11:52.249
if only to shine brighter
for the auditions tomorrow.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.468
I'm still trying to decide

11:54.535 --> 11:55.919
between "Maria"
and "Something's Coming. "

11:56.004 --> 11:58.705
Those are Tony songs. Are you
auditioning for Tony, too?

11:58.757 --> 12:00.891
Would that be weird?
No, no, not at all.

12:00.975 --> 12:02.375
You'd be a great Tony.

12:02.427 --> 12:04.344
Be the perfect Tony actually,
in some respects.

12:04.396 --> 12:07.264
Finn, you look like
you're stepping on bees.

12:07.348 --> 12:08.399
Come on,
Mercedes, blend.

12:08.483 --> 12:11.402
Well, except I'm a junior.

12:11.486 --> 12:13.153
Tony's the lead.

12:13.221 --> 12:15.489
Which means that a senior should
probably play that part.

12:15.556 --> 12:17.825
Yeah, that is kind
of how it works, huh?

12:17.892 --> 12:19.576
I'd be fine with Bernardo
or Officer Krupke.

12:19.661 --> 12:21.995
as long as it was
opposite your Tony.

12:22.063 --> 12:23.914
Kurt, jazz hands.
Fine.

12:27.786 --> 12:31.338
# La-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah #

12:31.405 --> 12:33.707
# La-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah #

12:33.758 --> 12:34.758
♪ La-ah... ♪

12:37.762 --> 12:39.596
Your range is better.

12:39.681 --> 12:41.765
It was impressive
a year and a half ago,

12:41.850 --> 12:43.767
but it's even
better now.

12:43.852 --> 12:45.686
This is a private rehearsal.

12:45.753 --> 12:48.188
What song are you
auditioning with?

12:48.256 --> 12:50.390
That's none of your business,
okay? If you've come here

12:50.442 --> 12:52.976
to ask me to join your little
group, the answer is no.

12:53.061 --> 12:54.561
My loyalty is
to the New Directions.

12:54.612 --> 12:56.029
They're my family,

12:56.097 --> 12:58.615
and family means something-
at least to me.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.985
Rachel, like we talked about
before I'm your birth mother.

13:02.070 --> 13:03.603
Yeah, but not my mother.
I know, okay?

13:03.655 --> 13:05.438
I almost had to go to therapy
because of you. Rachel...

13:05.490 --> 13:08.041
Look, I-I'll be polite, okay?
Don't worry, if I see you

13:08.109 --> 13:10.610
in the halls Il make
eye contact and I'll nod.

13:10.662 --> 13:12.546
Now if you'll excuse me,

13:12.614 --> 13:14.915
I have to get back
to my rehearsal.

13:16.918 --> 13:18.418
"Somewhere
there's a place for us. "

13:18.470 --> 13:21.839
I just said that there wasn't.
I'm talking about the song.

13:21.923 --> 13:23.290
I played Maria 18 times.

13:23.341 --> 13:24.925
"Somewhere" is the perfect
audition song for you.

13:24.976 --> 13:25.976
You should do it.

13:29.230 --> 13:30.797
Well, I was considering it.

13:30.849 --> 13:33.016
But it's a very
challenging song so...

13:33.101 --> 13:35.068
I was just going to do
"I Feel Pretty,"

13:35.136 --> 13:36.687
which I'm actually
amazing at.

13:36.771 --> 13:38.939
You will never become
a star or get the lead

13:38.990 --> 13:40.657
if you play it safe.

13:42.777 --> 13:45.045
Try it.

16:33.981 --> 16:36.616
Awesome.

16:39.954 --> 16:41.922
<i>Quinn Fabray used to be
on top of the world.</i>

16:41.989 --> 16:43.874
<i>She had it all.</i>

16:43.958 --> 16:48.995
<i>But now she walks the hallways
of McKinley High broken, alone.</i>

16:49.047 --> 16:51.965
<i>What happened, Quinn Fabray?</i>

16:52.016 --> 16:54.434
I got involved in the arts.

16:54.502 --> 16:58.505
And now after a long day of
snorting Splenda and cutting class,

16:58.556 --> 17:01.775
she kills the pain the
only way she knows how-

17:01.842 --> 17:04.277
smoking corn starch.

17:04.345 --> 17:06.646
Wait, what?

17:06.698 --> 17:09.483
Cut. The dummy could not
remember her lines, Coach.

17:09.534 --> 17:12.618
Now remember, just like
we rehearsed it.

17:12.685 --> 17:15.489
Mr. Schuester, I came here to
give you a piece of my mind.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.873
What's going on here?

17:16.958 --> 17:18.208
Rolling.
I used to have everything.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.327
Dated the quarterback
of the football team,

17:20.377 --> 17:22.496
was the captain of the Cheerios!

17:22.547 --> 17:24.464
I was the prettiest, most
popular girl at this school

17:24.531 --> 17:26.833
until I joined Glee Club,
and then it all went to hell.

17:26.884 --> 17:30.137
This is campaign dynamite.
I just want you to know

17:30.204 --> 17:34.424
that I am never coming back
to Glee Club- ever.

17:34.509 --> 17:36.709
Do you understand?
I hope you're happy.

17:36.761 --> 17:38.011
Ms. Fabray,

17:38.062 --> 17:39.763
wait.

17:39.847 --> 17:41.714
You know, there's only one
person in this world

17:41.766 --> 17:43.150
that you care about
and that's yourself.

17:43.217 --> 17:44.935
You have no idea...
I'm not finished!

17:45.019 --> 17:47.070
Whoa. You're not a little
girl anymore, Quinn.

17:47.155 --> 17:49.740
How long do you plan
on playing the victim card?

17:49.824 --> 17:52.192
Since day one, you've done
nothing but sabotage

17:52.243 --> 17:55.612
the same Glee Club that has been
there for you over and over again.

17:55.696 --> 17:57.998
When you got pregnant, when
your parents kicked you out,

17:58.065 --> 17:59.783
Mercedes even let
you live at her house.

17:59.867 --> 18:02.285
And I don't recall ever hearing
so much as a thank you.

18:02.370 --> 18:05.422
So now you're a train wreck.
Well, congratulations.

18:05.506 --> 18:08.908
But you stride into my office
and tell me that it's my fault?

18:08.960 --> 18:11.178
Well, then,

18:11.245 --> 18:13.096
I have something
to say to you.

18:13.181 --> 18:14.681
Grow up.

18:17.268 --> 18:19.419
Would you turn that thing off?

18:19.470 --> 18:21.438
And... cut.

18:21.522 --> 18:23.273
Fantastic. I got...

18:23.357 --> 18:25.225
Oh, no, damn it.

18:25.276 --> 18:27.694
My finger was over the thingie.
I didn't get any of that.

18:27.761 --> 18:28.595
Come on, Becky.

18:28.646 --> 18:29.813
That was really sexy.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.721
Hey.

18:54.788 --> 18:57.474
I hope it's okay that
I just stopped by.

18:57.558 --> 19:00.093
How do you know
where I live?

19:00.144 --> 19:04.797
Um, I have friends
in law enforcement.

19:04.849 --> 19:07.967
Noah, I told you, I want you
to be a part of Beth's life,

19:08.019 --> 19:10.821
but on my terms. You can't
just barge in on me like this.

19:10.905 --> 19:12.155
Here's a drug test.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.241
See? Totally clean.

19:14.308 --> 19:17.110
I also haven't had a drink since we talked
- besides beer.

19:17.161 --> 19:19.913
I even did some homework.
Turns out Napoleon,

19:19.980 --> 19:22.315
not just a dessert-
he was a real dude.

19:22.366 --> 19:23.667
Well, that is great.

19:23.751 --> 19:26.986
I'm- honestly I'm
truly impressed.

19:27.038 --> 19:30.207
But having a relationship with a child
isn't about little bursts of energy.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.175
This is a long-term commitment.

19:33.327 --> 19:34.845
Crap, she's awake.

19:34.929 --> 19:36.213
Hi, sweetie.

19:36.297 --> 19:38.348
Come here.

19:38.432 --> 19:41.718
Oh, that's it.

19:41.802 --> 19:45.305
Okay. It's okay.

19:45.356 --> 19:46.907
It's okay.

19:50.311 --> 19:52.062
My God, she
looks like Quinn.

19:52.146 --> 19:53.864
And you.

19:53.948 --> 19:55.699
She has that same
dopey smile.

19:55.783 --> 19:57.734
Can you say hi?

19:59.537 --> 20:01.821
I was happy, you know,

20:01.873 --> 20:04.991
that she was with you,
and it made it easier.

20:05.042 --> 20:06.576
I drew her a picture.

20:08.996 --> 20:10.714
It was supposed to be a clown,

20:10.798 --> 20:12.666
but it kind of turned out
like a pig,

20:12.717 --> 20:14.668
so I call it
a clown pig.

20:14.719 --> 20:16.336
It's kind of my own
made-up animal.

20:16.387 --> 20:18.037
Look what he drew us.
Huh?

20:18.089 --> 20:20.206
Thought it might
make her think of me.

20:21.726 --> 20:23.543
You don't think it will
scare her, do you?

20:23.594 --> 20:25.395
No. She'll be okay.

20:25.479 --> 20:27.147
She's tough.

20:28.933 --> 20:30.684
Do you want to hold her?

20:34.438 --> 20:36.022
Can he hold you?

20:36.073 --> 20:38.224
If he takes your blankie,
can he hold you?

20:38.276 --> 20:39.993
I don't want
to freak her out.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.395
We'll work up to it.

20:42.446 --> 20:44.397
I'll do anything-

20:44.448 --> 20:48.668
anything to prove to you
that I can be in her life.

20:48.736 --> 20:51.004
Please just give
me that chance.

20:59.669 --> 21:00.752
Here you go, buddy.

21:00.803 --> 21:02.387
Thanks, Coach.

21:02.455 --> 21:04.172
She's like my own
private Jim Henson.

21:04.257 --> 21:05.340
Next.

21:07.427 --> 21:08.793
Hello. I'm Kurt Hummel.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.846
And I'll be auditioning
for the role of Tony.

21:10.930 --> 21:11.980
The male lead.

21:12.065 --> 21:13.315
That's great, Kurt.

21:13.399 --> 21:15.851
I'll be performing the seminal,
and in my case,

21:15.935 --> 21:17.402
semiautobiographical
Broadway classic,

21:17.470 --> 21:19.438
<i>"I'm the Greatest Star,"
from Funny Girl.</i>

21:19.489 --> 21:20.989
Isn't that a Streisand song?

21:21.074 --> 21:23.191
I know what you're thinking,
but I got written permission

21:23.276 --> 21:25.043
from the woman herself.
Ms. Rachel Berry.

21:25.111 --> 21:27.979
And I'd also like to thank
Cassius from my dad's tire shop

21:28.030 --> 21:29.748
for kindly constructing
my audition scaffolding.

Menthol 100's?

24:36.969 --> 24:38.336
Really, skank?
You can't be in here.

24:38.387 --> 24:39.521
It's the girls' bathroom.

24:39.605 --> 24:41.940
I'm always here;
the stalls are cleaner.

24:42.007 --> 24:45.193
Hey, you need to lose the
skank act and get it together.

24:45.278 --> 24:46.844
Look, everyone needs
to leave me alone,

24:46.896 --> 24:48.363
because this is who I am.

24:48.447 --> 24:50.031
You look like a Real
Housewife of Reno.

24:51.317 --> 24:52.117
I saw Beth.

24:52.184 --> 24:53.851
So?

24:53.903 --> 24:54.852
She's perfect.

24:54.904 --> 24:57.188
She looks
just like you.

24:57.239 --> 24:58.239
Well, the old you.

24:58.324 --> 24:59.741
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

24:59.825 --> 25:01.376
We're not parent material.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.694
We can be.

25:02.745 --> 25:04.028
We're never
going to be together.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.081
I don't care about
you, I care about her.

25:06.165 --> 25:08.166
I don't want her having
questions or being messed up.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.968
She needs you
in her life.

25:13.372 --> 25:14.673
Okay, Marias.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.224
For me,
it's Rachel Berry.

25:16.309 --> 25:17.926
I'm just a huge fan.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.145
She's got the eye of the tiger,
which I like.

25:20.212 --> 25:21.813
She's Jewish,
but I think that helps

25:21.880 --> 25:23.481
with the whole
Puerto Rican thing.

25:23.549 --> 25:25.100
But we do have Mercedes
Jones coming in.

25:25.184 --> 25:27.435
For my money, she has the most
soulful voice here at McKinley.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.221
Yeah, she's not white, either,
which I like for Maria.

25:30.272 --> 25:32.073
So we'll keep an open mind.

25:32.158 --> 25:34.025
Okey-doke.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.076
Um, Kurt Hummel
for Tony.

25:35.161 --> 25:36.328
I mean, let's
talk about

25:36.395 --> 25:37.996
star quality, shall we?
Kurt was awesome.

25:38.063 --> 25:39.664
No question.

25:39.732 --> 25:42.367
He owned that song like
it was his prison bitch.

25:42.418 --> 25:45.570
My thing is, Tony's supposed
to be from the streets.

25:45.621 --> 25:46.904
He's the leader
of the Jets,

25:46.956 --> 25:48.673
an alpha gang member.

25:48.741 --> 25:51.126
I look at Kurt,
and I don't believe it.

25:51.210 --> 25:54.012
Well, respectfully, Coach,
Tony's retired from the Jets.

25:54.079 --> 25:55.513
He's a poet of
the urban jungle.

25:55.581 --> 25:58.933
There is a delicate
wholesomeness to Kurt

25:59.018 --> 26:01.636
that's unexpected, but
not unwelcome, for Tony.

26:01.721 --> 26:03.438
I mean, if I were Maria,
I'd love to be held

26:03.522 --> 26:05.457
in Kurt's toothpick
arms on my fire escape.

26:05.524 --> 26:07.108
Listen, I
love the kid,

26:07.193 --> 26:10.094
but I want a Tony
that excites my lady parts.

26:10.146 --> 26:13.064
Hummel's too much of a lady.

26:13.132 --> 26:14.199
Well, Artie, you
know him best.

26:14.266 --> 26:15.900
Could Kurt, you
know, could he pass?

26:15.951 --> 26:17.101
I'm a firm believer

26:17.153 --> 26:19.621
in color-blind,
non-traditional casting.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.873
For instance, I hope
to play Porgy one day.

26:21.940 --> 26:23.875
And we should definitely
see who else comes in.

26:23.942 --> 26:26.478
But, yeah, I'm a
little worried that

26:26.545 --> 26:29.881
Kurt may be a little
delicate for Tony.

26:58.036 --> 27:00.371
This is not the poster
we agreed on!

27:00.438 --> 27:02.373
The poster that you wanted
gave me crippling depression.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.824
I wanted something toned down!

27:03.908 --> 27:04.742
This is toned down.

27:04.793 --> 27:05.659
In the original,

27:05.744 --> 27:06.910
the unicorn was riding you.

27:06.961 --> 27:08.829
I don't know why
you're so upset.

27:08.913 --> 27:09.997
You're special; you
need to embrace it.

27:10.081 --> 27:12.449
This is who you are.
I'm not gonna win.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.801
Rachel, Rachel!
I need you.

27:13.885 --> 27:15.803
I need you to come with me
to the auditorium right now

27:15.887 --> 27:17.137
and help me audition
for Tony again.

27:17.222 --> 27:18.555
Last-minute emergency
audition? Say no more.

27:18.623 --> 27:20.341
And stop putting
up those posters!

27:23.345 --> 27:25.962
I failed my precious unicorn.

27:26.014 --> 27:27.398
No.

27:27.465 --> 27:28.766
Look, this campaign
is brilliant.

27:28.817 --> 27:30.100
Really?

27:30.151 --> 27:32.519
Completely. And if
he doesn't get it,

27:32.604 --> 27:35.639
then he doesn't deserve to have
you as his campaign manager.

27:35.690 --> 27:37.658
There's no one like you.

27:37.742 --> 27:40.527
You're a genius, Brittany.

27:40.612 --> 27:42.446
You are the unicorn.

27:49.921 --> 27:52.089
Are we seeing more
ethnic Marias today?

27:52.156 --> 27:53.156
That's rude.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.375
Is there any more?

27:54.459 --> 27:54.991
Oh.

27:55.043 --> 27:56.293
I'm sorry,

27:56.344 --> 27:57.611
I thought you two
auditioned already.

27:57.679 --> 28:00.180
You heard me sing,
but I wanted to show you

28:00.265 --> 28:04.017
the pure masculine power and
intensity I would bring to Tony

28:04.102 --> 28:06.103
if and when
you graced me with the part.

28:08.773 --> 28:09.973
Sorry. Sorry.

28:10.024 --> 28:12.676
I've asked your
obvious Maria-elect

28:12.727 --> 28:14.228
to do a cold reading
with me,

28:14.312 --> 28:15.946
<i>not from West Side Story,</i>

28:16.013 --> 28:18.031
but from the play
it's originally based on,

28:18.116 --> 28:20.234
<i>William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet.</i>

28:20.318 --> 28:22.352
And might I just add that I only
read through the scene once

28:22.404 --> 28:23.537
ten minutes ago
and I'm already off book.

28:23.621 --> 28:25.289
So you're playing Romeo, Kurt?

28:25.356 --> 28:27.357
Picture, if you will,

28:27.409 --> 28:29.376
Juliet's boudoir.

28:29.461 --> 28:30.377
Post coitus.

28:35.133 --> 28:36.633
Wilt thou be gone?

28:36.701 --> 28:37.918
It is not yet
near day.

28:38.002 --> 28:39.720
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

28:39.804 --> 28:42.172
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

28:42.223 --> 28:44.708
Nightly she sings on
yon pomegranate tree.

28:44.759 --> 28:47.895
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.

28:47.979 --> 28:51.181
'Tis the lark, the herald
of the morn, no nightingale.

28:51.232 --> 28:53.684
Look, love,
what envious streaks do lace

28:53.735 --> 28:56.219
the severing clouds
in yonder east.

28:56.271 --> 28:59.222
Night candles are burnt out,
and jocund day stands tiptoe

28:59.274 --> 29:01.191
on the misty mountain tops.

29:01.242 --> 29:03.560
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.696
Thou light is not daylight,
I know it, I.

29:05.747 --> 29:07.164
It is some meteor

29:07.231 --> 29:09.900
that the sun exhal'd, to
be to thee a torch bearer,

29:09.951 --> 29:12.286
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

29:12.370 --> 29:15.906
Therefore stay yet;
thou need'st not be gone.

29:15.957 --> 29:18.292
Let me be ta'en, let
me be put to death;

29:18.376 --> 29:20.093
for I am content,
thou wilt have it so.

29:20.178 --> 29:22.078
I'll say

29:22.130 --> 29:24.414
that yon grey is not
the morning eye.

29:24.466 --> 29:26.850
'Tis but the pale reflex
of Cynthia's brow...

29:31.222 --> 29:33.190
Nor-Nor that is
not the lark,

29:33.257 --> 29:36.026
whose notes do beat the vaulty
heaven so high above our heads.

29:36.093 --> 29:38.094
I have more care to stay
than will to go:

29:38.146 --> 29:39.980
home, death, welcome!

29:40.064 --> 29:41.431
For Juliet wills it so...

29:45.286 --> 29:47.037
No, it's- kiss me.
It's fine, you can kiss me.

29:47.104 --> 29:48.622
I don't...
We can keep going.

29:48.706 --> 29:49.656
Kurt.

29:49.741 --> 29:52.159
Kurt, I'm so sorry. Kurt.

Yeah, I sound good.

30:17.969 --> 30:18.802
You know,

30:18.853 --> 30:20.437
why don't you take the day off?

30:20.488 --> 30:22.773
<i>I need to catch up on
My Strange Addiction episodes,</i>

30:22.824 --> 30:24.608
and you kind of have this
irritating nasally quality

30:24.659 --> 30:26.577
that I can only take so much of.

30:26.644 --> 30:28.028
Sorry, Asperger's.

30:34.419 --> 30:35.419

30:35.486 --> 30:36.420
Nobody's hopeless.

30:36.487 --> 30:38.372
What happened to you, Quinn?

30:38.456 --> 30:39.840
Sorry.

30:39.924 --> 30:41.091
I know what happened to you.

30:41.158 --> 30:42.209
Same thing happened to me

30:42.293 --> 30:43.293
when I gave up Rachel.

30:43.344 --> 30:44.545
I went with
a Regis Philbin tattoo

30:44.629 --> 30:46.263
and the Sinead O'Connor
haircut.

30:46.331 --> 30:48.632
Must have looked like crap.

30:48.683 --> 30:50.183
It was a disaster.

30:52.604 --> 30:54.221
But eventually,
I realized

30:54.305 --> 30:56.306
that no matter
how much it hurt me...

30:58.192 --> 31:00.727
I did right by my daughter.

31:00.812 --> 31:03.397
That's the real measure
of motherhood:

31:03.481 --> 31:06.400
how much of yourself
will you give up for them?

31:06.484 --> 31:08.018
King Solomon and all that.

31:08.069 --> 31:09.820
Yeah, well, I'm not going back
to being that girl.

31:09.871 --> 31:11.538
Little miss
blonde perfect.

31:11.623 --> 31:12.956
Quinn...

31:13.024 --> 31:15.042
were you ever really that girl?

31:15.126 --> 31:16.627
I mean,
would that kind of girl

31:16.694 --> 31:18.194
even get pregnant
in the first place?

31:18.246 --> 31:20.964
Do you seriously expect me to
think that this is the real you?

31:21.032 --> 31:22.499
Yeah.

31:22.550 --> 31:23.500
Yeah, sure.

31:23.551 --> 31:25.052
Something like this.

31:25.136 --> 31:26.503
You're 18.
You're graduating high school.

31:26.554 --> 31:27.721
This is the time,

31:27.805 --> 31:30.257
this is the time
when you should find yourself.

31:30.341 --> 31:33.010
First step
to becoming an adult:

31:33.061 --> 31:34.561
stop punishing yourself

31:34.646 --> 31:36.430
for things you did
when you were a child.

31:40.051 --> 31:41.685
Can I see her?

31:41.736 --> 31:43.353
I know Puck got to.

31:43.404 --> 31:44.855
Not yet.

31:44.906 --> 31:47.691
How about a photo?

31:47.742 --> 31:48.692
Please?

31:57.068 --> 31:59.202
You want to know
who you really are?

31:59.253 --> 32:02.122
Look at that sweet,
special little face.

32:02.206 --> 32:03.707
She looks just like you.

32:03.758 --> 32:05.959
You can be a part of
this family, too, Quinn.

32:06.044 --> 32:08.712
I really want you to be.

32:08.763 --> 32:09.746
It's all up to you.

32:25.199 --> 32:26.783
Lug nut.

32:26.867 --> 32:28.034
Wrench.

32:29.987 --> 32:31.871
You're really good at
that, whatever it is

32:31.938 --> 32:33.773
that you're doing over there.

32:33.824 --> 32:36.125
Thanks for helping me out.
Yeah, well,

32:36.210 --> 32:38.161
I need the distraction. I'm
gonna be in emotional DEFCON 1

32:38.245 --> 32:40.296
until they post the audition
results for the musical,

32:40.381 --> 32:42.948
which means I'm gonna be even
more self-centered than usual,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.751
just so you know. Why? You
know you're gonna get the lead.

32:44.802 --> 32:46.386
I know I am, but, I mean,

32:46.453 --> 32:47.887
you don't really know
until you know.

32:47.954 --> 32:49.338
You can still try out.

32:49.423 --> 32:51.174
I mean, the field for Tony
is wide open.

32:51.258 --> 32:52.508
Well, I mean, between
football and school,

32:52.593 --> 32:53.843
I don't really have time.

32:53.927 --> 32:55.395
And I got to go to
this Booty Camp thing.

32:55.462 --> 32:58.464
My dancing has got to get better
or it's gonna cost us Nationals.

32:58.515 --> 33:00.400
Plus, Burt pays me good here.

33:00.467 --> 33:02.468
I'm saving up
for college and stuff.

33:02.519 --> 33:03.736
I just... I don't want you
to give up

33:03.804 --> 33:04.937
on what makes you most special.

33:04.988 --> 33:06.773
You know, you're
really talented.

33:06.824 --> 33:09.859
Talented enough to get
into NYADA if you applied.

33:09.943 --> 33:11.911
What if I don't want to?
I mean, and not saying

33:11.978 --> 33:14.113
that I don't,
but if I stay here,

33:14.164 --> 33:16.449
work for Burt, I mean,
would that be so bad?

33:16.500 --> 33:19.752
No, not if it made you happy.

33:19.820 --> 33:21.337
But I don't
think it would.

33:21.422 --> 33:22.855
You're better than that.

33:22.923 --> 33:25.558
You may not know
it, but I do.

33:25.626 --> 33:27.710
You're the best girlfriend ever.

33:28.995 --> 33:30.596
No, you have grease
on your nose.

33:30.664 --> 33:32.465
Oh. Sorry.

33:32.516 --> 33:33.466
What the heck?

33:34.768 --> 33:36.886
Quit making out
in the shop.

33:36.970 --> 33:39.138
What do you want?
Nothing.

33:39.189 --> 33:41.057
Is Finn the only son
that can help out around here?

33:41.141 --> 33:42.692
Uh, no, but you only
volunteer to help

33:42.776 --> 33:44.894
when you want money or you want
to talk about something.

33:44.978 --> 33:46.062
What's going on?

33:46.146 --> 33:48.114
I made a list.

33:48.181 --> 33:49.565
These are the only musicals

33:49.650 --> 33:51.234
that I am a shoo-in to
play the lead role in.

33:51.318 --> 33:52.902
<i>Number one: La Cage aux Folles.</i>

33:52.986 --> 33:54.704
<i>Number two: Falsettos.</i>

33:54.788 --> 33:57.490
<i>Number three: Miss Saigon,
as Miss Saigon.</i>

33:57.541 --> 34:00.660
But that's off the list when
and if I ever start shaving.

34:00.711 --> 34:01.694
Du, you're gay.

34:01.745 --> 34:03.195
Excuse me?
You're gay.

34:03.247 --> 34:05.331
And you're not like Rock Hudson
gay; you're really gay.

34:05.382 --> 34:06.666
You sing
like Diana Ross,

34:06.717 --> 34:08.634
and you dress like you own
a magic chocolate factory.

34:08.702 --> 34:09.702
Okay, why are
you being

34:09.753 --> 34:10.920
so mean to me?
What is wrong

34:10.987 --> 34:12.221
with any of that?
It's who you are.

34:12.306 --> 34:14.223
And I'm not saying that
I'm ashamed of it.

34:14.308 --> 34:16.259
The problem is that if I want
to be an actor,

34:16.342 --> 34:18.478
I have to pass as straight
to get the great romantic roles.

34:18.545 --> 34:21.313
And I want those roles.
Every actor does.

34:21.380 --> 34:25.318
But to not get a shot at it-
I mean, it kills me.

34:25.385 --> 34:27.219
I don't know if you've
noticed, but no one's

34:27.271 --> 34:28.771
really looking for
a Kurt Hummel type

34:28.856 --> 34:31.056
to play opposite Kate
Hudson in a rom com.

34:31.108 --> 34:33.058
Kurt, I say, if they're
not writing movies

34:33.110 --> 34:34.610
and plays for
performers like you,

34:34.695 --> 34:36.496
then you got to start
writing your own.

34:36.563 --> 34:38.246
I mean, you're awesome.

34:38.331 --> 34:39.565
Change the rules.
Write your own history.

34:39.616 --> 34:42.067
I'm just tired
of being a unicorn, Dad.

34:42.119 --> 34:44.954
You know what they call
a unicorn without a horn?

34:45.038 --> 34:46.755
A freaking horse.

35:05.392 --> 35:06.392
That's it.

35:06.443 --> 35:07.760
All right, Finn.

35:07.811 --> 35:10.029
You got this, buddy.
Come on.

35:10.096 --> 35:12.031
Ha ha roo-ha ha.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.775
You okay?
I can't do this.

35:22.826 --> 35:24.493
You can.
I can't.

35:24.578 --> 35:26.329
Hey, who knows more
about dancing- you or me?

35:26.413 --> 35:27.713
You.

35:27.781 --> 35:29.448
That's right.

35:29.499 --> 35:30.917
Look, I know
you can do this.

35:30.968 --> 35:32.284
And I believe in you.

35:33.470 --> 35:34.720
One more time.

35:34.788 --> 35:35.972
That's right.

35:37.674 --> 35:39.258
Here we go.

35:49.469 --> 35:50.937
There you go.

36:02.366 --> 36:04.784
Good job, buddy.

36:04.835 --> 36:07.253
That's great.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.088
Can I help
you, Quinn?

36:10.624 --> 36:12.842
I heard this was for people
who needed a little help

36:12.926 --> 36:15.160
with their dance moves
and want to win Nationals.

36:15.212 --> 36:17.763
That's right.
So, I'm a little rusty.

36:17.831 --> 36:21.767
And, uh... would it be cool
if I joined in?

36:21.835 --> 36:24.520
Absolutely.

36:24.605 --> 36:26.555
Welcome back.
Get in here, girl.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.673
You've been missed.

36:29.276 --> 36:30.359
All right.
Oh, I've missed you.

36:30.444 --> 36:31.677
All right, let's line it up.

36:31.728 --> 36:33.946
Enough, enough. All right,
let's get in lines.

36:34.014 --> 36:35.481
Booty Camp, here we go.
Line it up.

36:35.532 --> 36:36.849
Oh, Kurt, um...

36:38.018 --> 36:39.452
I'm proud of you.

36:42.489 --> 36:44.189
I have to get her back.

36:44.241 --> 36:45.574
If that takes dying
my hair blonde

36:45.659 --> 36:47.526
and pretending that
I think I'm special,

36:47.577 --> 36:48.861
that's something
I'm willing to do.

36:48.912 --> 36:50.496
We're going to
get full custody.

36:59.110 --> 37:00.828
Do you eat a whole chicken
every day?

37:00.912 --> 37:02.579
I eat a whole chicken
at every meal.

37:02.647 --> 37:04.665
Well, hello, She-Hulk,

37:04.749 --> 37:07.117
Weepy the Vestclown.
Good one.

37:07.168 --> 37:08.652
And Little Miss Golden Marmoset.

37:08.703 --> 37:10.838
It's a Brazilian
monkey,

37:10.922 --> 37:12.589
and seriously, it's
your spitting image.

37:12.657 --> 37:14.174
I'm going to send
you a photo.

37:14.259 --> 37:16.326
Are you still at
FreakishBonyGinger@gmail?

37:16.377 --> 37:18.095
Oh hey, Sue,
you hear the good news?

37:18.179 --> 37:19.596
Quinn is back
in Glee Club,

37:19.664 --> 37:20.881
which sort of throws a wrench

37:20.965 --> 37:21.932
in your whole
campaign commercial.

37:21.999 --> 37:23.267
Well, actually,
Butt Chin,

37:23.334 --> 37:25.102
couldn't have written
it any better myself.

37:25.169 --> 37:27.838
In fact, it gives my campaign
a whole new narrative.

37:27.889 --> 37:29.339
Quinn Fabray is an addict,

37:29.390 --> 37:31.108
and she's relapsed

37:31.175 --> 37:32.810
back into her
Glee Club addiction.

37:32.861 --> 37:34.278
Mmm.
You see, the arts

37:34.345 --> 37:36.864
are like crack, William,
but much more addictive

37:36.948 --> 37:38.365
and not nearly
as glamorous.

37:38.450 --> 37:40.284
And my new spot
airs tomorrow.

37:40.351 --> 37:41.401
Sorry, Sue.

37:41.486 --> 37:43.403
Your scare tactics
are not going to work.

37:43.488 --> 37:45.456
Well, they're already
working, William.

37:45.523 --> 37:47.875
You see, I've made hating
the arts into a brand.

37:47.959 --> 37:49.743
People are hurting,
unemployment is up,

37:49.828 --> 37:51.662
the dollar is weak,
and the arts smack

37:51.713 --> 37:53.747
of elitism and
self-absorption,

37:53.832 --> 37:55.916
indulgence and
privilege.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.634
When times are tough,
that's something

37:57.702 --> 37:59.837
that Americans
cannot stomach.

37:59.888 --> 38:01.338
Well, I just
got a text

38:01.389 --> 38:04.258
from Becky, replete with
hilarious auto-corrects.

38:04.342 --> 38:06.126
Polling has me
nine points up

38:06.194 --> 38:09.045
on my Republican challenger/
pizza magnate,

38:09.097 --> 38:11.098
Reggie "The Sauce" Salazar.
You know what that means?

38:11.199 --> 38:14.151
It means, today,
I am in first place.

38:14.218 --> 38:16.103
So I'm going to have
a seat over there

38:16.187 --> 38:17.187
at the first
place table.

38:17.238 --> 38:18.722
Hey, you're free
to join me-

38:18.773 --> 38:21.325
if any of you have ever
come in first place.

38:21.392 --> 38:23.911
Recently.

38:23.995 --> 38:25.946
What are we going to do?
We cannot let her win.

38:26.030 --> 38:27.447
Then we got to
find someone

38:27.532 --> 38:28.999
with credibility to
run against her.

38:29.066 --> 38:30.901
I mean, the anti-Sue.

38:50.688 --> 38:52.306
Brittany, hey, hey.
Look. Huh?

38:52.390 --> 38:54.107
You were absolutely right.

38:54.192 --> 38:56.143
I need to celebrate
who I am.

38:56.227 --> 38:57.761
And I am unicorn.

38:57.812 --> 39:00.531
Oh, I love my happy,
happy unicorn.

39:00.598 --> 39:01.899
Thank you.

39:01.950 --> 39:03.567
I'm so proud of you.

39:03.618 --> 39:05.369
So what do you say you come
to my place after school

39:05.436 --> 39:07.487
and, uh, we'll give
each other oatmeal facials

39:07.572 --> 39:09.206
<i>and... and watch
Project Runway</i>

39:09.273 --> 39:11.742
and, you know, talk
campaign strategy

39:11.793 --> 39:13.961
while, uh, sampling
some of my zero-cal

39:14.045 --> 39:15.796
loganberry pumpkin torte. Huh?
Huh? Thanks, um, but I can't.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.798
Santana and I are working
on campaign posters.

39:17.882 --> 39:19.583
Oh, um, I...
I already have them.

39:19.634 --> 39:21.385
No, for my campaign.

39:21.452 --> 39:23.003
I decided to run, too.
'Cause, you know,

39:23.087 --> 39:24.555
the last six senior
class presidents,

39:24.622 --> 39:26.790
they've all been guys, and
look where that's got us-

39:26.841 --> 39:28.458
you know, teetering on
a double-dip recession.

39:28.526 --> 39:31.127
Besides, I'm
also a unicorn.

39:31.179 --> 39:33.347
Maybe a bi-corn.

39:33.431 --> 39:35.799
Either way, I'm starting
to believe in my own magic.

39:35.850 --> 39:37.968
Good luck, Kurt.

39:38.019 --> 39:39.236
I will see you at
the debate, okay?

39:42.073 --> 39:43.574
Blaine Anderson.

39:45.276 --> 39:47.277
Hi, guys.
Greetings.

39:47.328 --> 39:49.446
Uh, what song will you
be singing today?
