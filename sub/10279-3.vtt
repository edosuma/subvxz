Stop compressions.

00:09.039 --> 00:10.496
You killed him.

00:10.497 --> 00:13.782
If I'm such a horrible person, how
could you possibly want to be with me?

00:13.883 --> 00:16.924
I'm done, okay?
Carter can have you.

00:16.961 --> 00:18.858
She came in without a blood pressure.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.879
She had massive internal bleeding,
it was too severe to repair.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.562
I found three pictures of Jesse
left on the roll.

00:25.182 --> 00:27.415
I fell apart. Right in the store.

00:27.919 --> 00:30.016
You look lovely.

00:30.093 --> 00:31.688
Thank you.

00:31.789 --> 00:35.034
Promise me you won't grow up too fast, Ok?

00:43.382 --> 00:45.870
We were running late.
I threw a bunch of stuff in here.

00:46.048 --> 00:48.417
I got some snacks
and movies for later.

00:49.339 --> 00:51.578
I'll pick him up around 8, okay?

00:52.838 --> 00:54.544
Jackie?

00:55.712 --> 00:57.205
I'll pick him up around 8.

00:57.795 --> 00:59.832
Yeah. Sure.

01:00.003 --> 01:02.206
Listen, I really appreciate this.

01:02.377 --> 01:04.864
I've got a nanny agency
setting up some interviews.

01:05.043 --> 01:06.500
Don't worry about it, Peter.

John?

01:26.038 --> 01:28.407
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:28.579 --> 01:30.201
I brought you some aspirin.

01:30.370 --> 01:32.609
Oh, Gamma,
I just need to stretch it out.

01:33.286 --> 01:35.774
What you need
is to see my orthopedist.

01:35.952 --> 01:39.068
- I'm making you an appointment today.
- Covering half a shift today.

01:39.243 --> 01:42.193
- Then tomorrow.
- I don't need to see your doctor.

01:42.492 --> 01:45.158
Your back is nothing to trifle with.

01:45.325 --> 01:48.903
You don't want to end up
with a hunch like Uncle Everett.

01:49.657 --> 01:51.066
This isn't orthopedic, Gamma.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.858
- I was stabbed.
- I know that, John.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.946
All the more reason
to take care of yourself.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.233
- Sorry.
- It's okay, Gamma. I'll get it.

02:00.404 --> 02:03.401
No! Don't move.
You have no shoes on.

02:03.570 --> 02:06.852
- All part of my ninja training.
- Your what?

03:18.926 --> 03:22.753
Oh, no. Sh-

04:13.712 --> 04:16.961
Maybe we should go back
to taking shifts.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.827
Are you gonna make it?

04:19.007 --> 04:20.999
I thought this walk
was supposed to wake me up.

04:21.175 --> 04:22.420
I offered to get you coffee.

04:22.593 --> 04:25.083
I don't need coffee.
I need more than two hours' sleep.

04:25.262 --> 04:27.668
Rachel was 7
before she slept through the night.

04:27.846 --> 04:29.341
Oh, God. Bite your tongue.

04:29.514 --> 04:33.463
How big is the hundred-gallon tank
in feet? Like 2 by 4, 3 by 5?

04:33.642 --> 04:36.428
Weaver's on the warpath.
Run for your lives. Save yourselves.

04:36.603 --> 04:37.978
- I'm going upstairs.
- Chicken.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.980
- Well, how much is a 300-gallon tank?
- $595.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.689
- Without fish?
- Give me something.

04:42.856 --> 04:45.561
- Is that saltwater?
- I don't know. I didn't taste it.

04:45.734 --> 04:48.692
- If it's saltwater...
- This guy checked in at 10:00 last night.

04:48.861 --> 04:51.731
Don't look at me. Weaver's taking
histories on every patient...

04:51.905 --> 04:54.739
- ... and ordering every test in the book.
- I don't know. Fish.

04:54.907 --> 04:58.239
- There's a red one and a yellow one...
- Unnecessary tests?

04:58.409 --> 05:00.733
You better do something
before somebody shoots her.

05:00.911 --> 05:03.484
- I have to call you back.
- Let's treat and street.

05:03.663 --> 05:05.987
- Any candidates for early parole?
- Take your pick.

05:06.164 --> 05:08.915
- Who's on first?
- Jenny. Possible bladder infection.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.490
Dip's positive for leukocytes.
ICON's negative.

05:11.668 --> 05:14.075
- Jenny, you allergic to any medications?
- No.

05:14.253 --> 05:17.586
All right. I'm gonna give you Bactrim.
One every 12 hours for three days.

05:17.756 --> 05:19.664
Come back if you're not
doing any better.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.089
- Got him waiting on an ankle x-ray.
- I think it's broken.

05:23.176 --> 05:24.635
- Fall off your horse?
- Yes.

05:24.719 --> 05:26.960
- Really?
- It was for the jousting demonstration...

05:27.137 --> 05:28.762
- ... at the Renaissance Faire.
- Cool.

05:28.930 --> 05:29.961
- Any pain here?
- No.

05:30.139 --> 05:31.883
- How about here?
- No. Not too bad.

05:32.058 --> 05:34.927
Okay. I need you to walk for me.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.513
- Yeah, it hurts.
- Yeah.

05:37.686 --> 05:41.101
If you can walk on it, it's just a sprain.
Ice it, wrap it...

05:41.272 --> 05:43.941
- ... and give him some ibuprofen.
- That's it?

05:44.107 --> 05:48.104
Well, normally I'd do some bloodletting,
but we're low on leeches.

05:49.111 --> 05:51.779
- Don't forget about me, Dr. Greene.
- Hi, Candy.

05:51.946 --> 05:53.570
- Hi.
- Human bite to the buttocks.

05:53.739 --> 05:56.905
- Again?
- Some boys can't get enough Candy.

05:57.074 --> 06:00.240
Five hundred of Augmentin
and prep her for suturing.

06:00.410 --> 06:03.529
- Who's sick? You or the pig?
- It's not funny. My hand really hurts.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.289
- Think how the pig feels.
- Mark, what are you doing?

06:06.414 --> 06:08.987
Trying to treat some patients
before they eat each other.

06:09.167 --> 06:10.957
He's already discharged two.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.283
- Thank you, Haleh.
- I think I need Surgilube.

06:13.461 --> 06:16.211
- No kidding.
- You didn't do a proper exam on that girl.

06:16.379 --> 06:18.418
You could have missed pyelo, PID-

06:18.506 --> 06:19.537
She was afebrile.

06:19.631 --> 06:22.418
Garden-variety UTl.
Make your hand this shape.

06:22.592 --> 06:26.042
Okay. I want all patients
to be examined thoroughly.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.627
The moment we become complacent,
we make mistakes.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.263
Speak for yourself.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.802
Haleh, put Jenny in a gown,
set her up for a pelvic.

06:32.974 --> 06:34.516
- Dr. Weaver?
- I'm listening.

06:34.643 --> 06:37.677
Twenty-two-year-old woman
with chest pain reproduced by palpation.

06:37.853 --> 06:41.635
- Pulse ox is 97. EKG looks normal.
- Okay. Send her out.

06:41.813 --> 06:44.482
I'm only asking because she's taking
birth-control pills...

06:44.566 --> 06:46.225
...putting her at risk for a PE.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.642
- So I was wondering if we should send-
- I got it.

06:48.819 --> 06:50.146
- What?
- Yeah.

06:50.319 --> 06:53.818
- You can look at last month's Ql data.
- No, no. I just need to know...

06:53.989 --> 06:56.277
- ... if we should order a V/Q-
- I'll take it.

06:57.158 --> 06:59.150
- Okay.
- Dr. Chen.

06:59.326 --> 07:01.994
I've got an abandoned newborn female,
maybe 2 hours old.

07:02.077 --> 07:04.235
- How's her color?
- Some peripheral cyanosis.

07:04.329 --> 07:06.998
They dumped her at St. Anthony's.
She's cold to the touch.

07:07.123 --> 07:09.695
- Airway's okay, but a weak cry.
- Trauma 1.

07:09.792 --> 07:13.290
Have you tried letting him fall asleep
with you, then moving him to his bed?

07:13.460 --> 07:15.204
Doesn't matter.
He wakes up crying.

07:15.379 --> 07:17.620
I ask if he's having a nightmare,
he says, "Yeah. "

07:17.797 --> 07:20.333
- But he can't tell me what they're about.
- About Carla?

07:20.507 --> 07:23.562
Yeah. I found him wandering around the
apartment with his little flashlight,

07:23.597 --> 07:27.337
- ... looking for her.
- Poor guy. He's confused.

07:27.512 --> 07:30.181
- Yeah.
- It has to get better eventually.

07:30.347 --> 07:34.972
I don't know. We were making breakfast
this morning, and it dawned on me...

07:35.142 --> 07:37.134
...my son's gonna grow up
without a mother.

07:37.310 --> 07:40.263
Something so basic,
such a big part of who he'll be.

07:40.437 --> 07:43.058
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- Hey, Cleo.

07:43.231 --> 07:45.721
- I reduced your prolapsed rectum.
- What?

07:45.900 --> 07:48.852
- Yeah. I used the old sugar trick.
- You treated my patient?

07:48.984 --> 07:50.644
- Yeah. She was in pain.
- With sugar?

07:50.819 --> 07:53.773
Yeah. You sprinkle a little on,
water escapes from the mucosa...

07:53.947 --> 07:56.568
...the edema subsides,
and you pop that puppy back in.

07:56.741 --> 07:59.147
It could have been
a prolapsed hemorrhoid.

07:59.325 --> 08:00.985
Trust me. That was no hemorrhoid.

08:01.077 --> 08:03.614
No, wait. Who asked you to see her?

08:03.786 --> 08:07.321
Hey, Dave. Don't treat my patients
unless I ask you to.

08:07.498 --> 08:10.248
- I rectified the situation.
- Anyone could have shoved it in.

08:10.417 --> 08:12.325
"Rectify." You get it? Funny.

08:12.502 --> 08:15.205
- I was waiting for a surgical consult.
- Oh, come on.

08:15.378 --> 08:18.082
- You were gabbing with your boyfriend.
- Is there a problem?

08:18.255 --> 08:21.623
Yes. I never knew anyone so possessive
over somebody else's butthole.

08:21.799 --> 08:25.630
- Just stay away from my patients.
- It's a Freudian thing, isn't it?

08:25.802 --> 08:29.550
Who keeps stealing my ultrasound?
We need it for that kid in Curtain 3.

08:29.722 --> 08:32.554
Can somebody get Mrs. Lorenzo
in a gown and put the...?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.011
Who are you hiding from?

08:43.688 --> 08:47.187
- Are you giving yourself a pedicure?
- I think I stepped on a piece of glass.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.185
Let me see.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.601
Yeah, you got something in there.

08:52.778 --> 08:55.399
- Want me to try and take it out?
- Yeah, please.

09:02.453 --> 09:05.238
Luka and I broke up a few days ago.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.704
Why?

09:11.042 --> 09:14.161
Both of us realized the relationship
wasn't working a long time ago.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.577
Neither one of us wanted
to be the one to call it.

09:18.797 --> 09:22.579
- So it was amicable?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

09:23.926 --> 09:25.549
Sorry.

09:28.845 --> 09:32.261
- Is that why you're avoiding him?
- Partly.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.595
- I had to go to his place this morning-
- Carter.

09:36.475 --> 09:38.218
Chen needs you in Trauma 1.

09:40.645 --> 09:41.973
- What about your foot?
- Sorry.

09:42.146 --> 09:45.596
You're gonna have to find
another excuse to hide out in here.

09:45.773 --> 09:47.730
Have you seen Mr. Fell's digoxin level?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.394
Ask Abby. She was working him up.

09:49.568 --> 09:52.140
- Carter, have you seen Abby?
- Try the lounge.

09:53.237 --> 09:55.394
Setup heated,
humidified O-2 for blow-by.

09:55.572 --> 09:57.196
- What's this?
- Abandoned newborn.

09:57.365 --> 10:01.065
Needs warm IV fluids, but I can't
get a line. Can you try an interosseous?

10:01.243 --> 10:03.152
- Where did they leave her?
- A church.

10:03.328 --> 10:06.660
- They didn't even bother to dry her off.
- Temp was 91.2.

10:06.830 --> 10:09.236
Boy, she hardly even reacts
when you stick her.

10:09.414 --> 10:10.743
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

10:10.916 --> 10:13.038
I went through the bone.
I need some gauze.

10:13.209 --> 10:16.742
- Chuny, any luck?
- I can't find the scalp vein.

10:17.129 --> 10:20.792
- Carter?
- I'm in. Let's push 60 cc's of saline.

10:20.922 --> 10:22.879
- How's the Accu-Chek?
- Eighty-two.

10:23.007 --> 10:26.422
- We need a cath urine for culture.
- Carter?

10:26.594 --> 10:29.048
- It's infiltrating.
- Damn it.

10:29.220 --> 10:32.386
- Heart rate's 180.
- Okay. This kid needs fluids right now.

10:32.556 --> 10:35.591
- Call Pedes Surgery to do a cutdown.
- What about an umbilical line?

10:35.766 --> 10:38.257
- I can't.
- I did one during my internship.

10:39.185 --> 10:41.510
We won't get it
if she's more than a few hours old.

10:41.687 --> 10:44.473
Fewer complications than a cutdown.
We just need two minutes.

10:45.481 --> 10:46.857
Go get an umbilical-line kit.

10:47.024 --> 10:49.858
- No. Chuny, page Pedes Surgery.
- Just go get the kit, Deb.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.194
What's wrong with kids these days?

10:52.361 --> 10:54.686
They used to think it was cool
to see me on stilts.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.902
Maybe they're more sophisticated
than we were.

10:57.072 --> 11:00.026
- You mean more vicious.
- They knocked him over.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.283
On purpose. The little buggers
were cheering when I went down.

11:03.452 --> 11:05.491
I made an appointment
for him to see Ortho.

11:05.662 --> 11:08.615
Good. Until then,
keep your wrist elevated and iced.

11:08.789 --> 11:10.615
- Can I get a note for work?
- No problem.

11:10.790 --> 11:13.495
- Hey, boss? Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.374
Hey.

11:16.419 --> 11:17.961
- Hey.
- Dave, what's your question?

11:18.129 --> 11:19.753
Nothing. Hold the elevator.

11:19.922 --> 11:21.166
- Hold it!
- We're full.

11:21.339 --> 11:23.627
- This is a medical emergency.
- Are you a doctor?

11:23.799 --> 11:27.630
- Yeah. I'm Dr. Dave.
- So I've been warned.

11:31.012 --> 11:32.637
I told you we were full.

11:32.806 --> 11:35.342
- Open your eyes.
- He got caught in one of his traps.

11:35.474 --> 11:37.181
- Traps?
- Jungle Bob lives in the park.

11:37.350 --> 11:39.224
Homeless guys can be very territorial.

11:39.393 --> 11:41.634
Malik, I need a lateral C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

11:41.811 --> 11:44.480
- Abby's covering Trauma.
- I got this. Go.

11:44.647 --> 11:46.686
My friend Marty's a mime.
He carries a gun.

11:46.857 --> 11:48.185
- I hope you're kidding.
- No.

11:48.358 --> 11:50.646
Some punks love to hear
the mime scream.

11:50.818 --> 11:53.688
Dr. Greene, Weaver wants
a wound culture on your butt bite.

11:53.862 --> 11:56.565
- I've been on my own since I was 10.
- Rachel?

11:56.738 --> 11:58.398
- Hi, Daddy.
- What are you doing here?

11:58.573 --> 12:00.482
- I came to see you.
- How did you get here?

12:00.658 --> 12:02.650
- She took the train.
- From St. Louis?

12:02.826 --> 12:04.984
- By yourself?
- Mom kicked me out.

12:05.161 --> 12:07.995
My mom kicked me out too.
Best thing that ever happened to me.

12:08.163 --> 12:10.701
- Need a drape?
- Somebody tied off the umbilical cord...

12:10.874 --> 12:12.154
...with a shoelace.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.823
- Ten blade and umbilical tape.
- Where the hell's Pedes?

12:15.002 --> 12:16.957
- Flush the catheter.
- They should be here.

12:17.128 --> 12:18.503
Come on, Deb. Stay with me.

12:18.670 --> 12:22.168
- Can't get a BP.
- Okay, turn off the alarm.

12:22.339 --> 12:23.834
- Somebody get Weaver.
- Hold on.

12:24.007 --> 12:25.287
I'm cutting the cord.

12:28.510 --> 12:32.128
- What if we can't pass the catheter?
- It's okay. Umbilical vein looks good.

12:32.388 --> 12:34.179
Prep and drape the ankle,
just in case.

12:36.015 --> 12:38.506
What do you think she weighs,
about 3 kilos?

12:38.684 --> 12:41.221
- Maybe a little more.
- Let's get ready with 20 per kilo.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.513
- Got it.
- Okay. In at 5 centimeters.

12:44.688 --> 12:46.431
Okay, try and draw it back.

12:49.275 --> 12:51.433
- Two-cc return.
- We got a good vein.

12:51.610 --> 12:54.361
- Yeah.
- All right, let's push the 60-cc bolus.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.770
- That's nice work, Deb.
- Thanks.

12:56.947 --> 12:58.901
3-0 silk on a needle driver.

13:01.825 --> 13:04.661
Yeah, okay. Well, thank you.
Correct.

13:04.829 --> 13:07.866
- How much longer?
- They're working on it.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.663
I don't know if I can wait any longer.

13:10.836 --> 13:12.995
- It's so hot in here.
- Everybody just relax.

13:13.172 --> 13:15.877
- This happens all the time.
- They think I have an ulcer.

13:16.050 --> 13:17.676
Yeah.

13:17.844 --> 13:20.417
- If you get scared, I'll hold you.
- Scared of what?

13:20.598 --> 13:22.471
- Plummeting to our deaths.
- What?

13:22.642 --> 13:24.219
He's just kidding, ma'am.

13:24.393 --> 13:27.893
You know, maybe it would be best
if you just stopped talking.

13:28.273 --> 13:31.974
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No! No, no one's gonna be sick.

13:32.152 --> 13:35.771
No one's gonna faint.
We're all just gonna relax and-

13:43.791 --> 13:45.167
Good song?

13:45.335 --> 13:47.742
- What?
- I love the song.

13:47.921 --> 13:50.329
- You listen to Abandoned Ghouls?
- I do now.

13:50.507 --> 13:52.916
Along with everybody else
within a six-block radius.

13:53.094 --> 13:54.671
It wasn't that loud.

13:54.845 --> 13:56.969
Don't come to me
when you need a hearing aid.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.225
What about those old Led Zeppelin
records you're always playing?

14:00.394 --> 14:03.894
Okay, they're albums, not records.
And they're vintage, not old.

14:04.064 --> 14:07.185
Whatever. You still play them
way louder than this.

14:07.694 --> 14:11.063
- Chicken or beef?
- Dad, I'm a vegetarian.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.197
I knew that.

14:13.618 --> 14:16.822
Mom thinks it's just a phase.
Hello, it's called a healthy lifestyle.

14:16.997 --> 14:18.242
Maybe you should try it.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.906
Exactly what happened
between the two of you?

14:21.085 --> 14:23.493
I told you, she kicked me out.

14:24.589 --> 14:26.167
She did.

14:26.341 --> 14:29.924
I came home from my friend Stacy's and
she had thrown my clothes on the lawn.

14:30.095 --> 14:32.088
- I left.
- Why'd she throw your clothes out?

14:32.265 --> 14:34.056
She's crazy.

14:34.726 --> 14:37.643
Seriously, I think she needs therapy.

14:37.896 --> 14:40.138
She grounded me
for being home a half-hour late.

14:40.315 --> 14:44.645
I mean, come on, Dad. A half-hour.
It's summer vacation.

14:44.820 --> 14:48.440
- I'll call her.
- Don't bother. She's beyond reason.

14:48.659 --> 14:49.940
Does she know you're here?

14:51.662 --> 14:54.450
Rachel, you've got to let her know
you're here.

14:54.624 --> 14:58.325
- Why?
- Why? Because she'll be worried to death.

14:58.545 --> 15:01.915
- So what?
- Hello.

15:02.133 --> 15:04.422
- Rachel.
- She dropped in for a visit.

15:04.593 --> 15:06.801
That's a nice surprise.
How long are you in town?

15:06.888 --> 15:09.379
- You here for the consult?
- Yeah, a rule-out appy.

15:09.474 --> 15:11.467
That's mine. End-stage dementia.

15:11.643 --> 15:13.970
I'll be right back.
Call your mother.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.475
Bye.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.686
- You didn't tell me she was in town.
- I didn't know. She ran away.

15:18.861 --> 15:21.648
- Why?
- To join the circus? I don't know.

15:21.822 --> 15:24.029
She and Jen are having
mother-daughter issues.

15:24.116 --> 15:26.952
- I'm sure you know what that's like.
- I didn't run away.

15:27.036 --> 15:30.406
No, of course not. Your mother
would have set the hounds out on you.

15:30.582 --> 15:33.917
This guy's definitely not breathing.
He needs an airway.

15:34.837 --> 15:38.124
Hand me this when I say "tube. "
Okay?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.589
- There's no air in here.
- I can't see squat.

15:40.761 --> 15:42.303
All right, you.

15:42.471 --> 15:44.013
- Push on his neck.
- What?

15:44.182 --> 15:47.599
Give me your hand. Like this.
There you go.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.522
Okay.

15:51.774 --> 15:53.981
Forget it. I'm never gonna see the cords.

15:56.029 --> 15:58.817
- Oh, my God!
- Damn it. Blew the line.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.533
- Bag him.
- I don't know how-

16:00.701 --> 16:03.371
Just squeeze the bag
every three seconds.

16:03.538 --> 16:06.455
One, two, three, squeeze.
All right?

16:06.625 --> 16:09.377
One, two- Hey, hey, hey!
Help her! Help her!

16:09.545 --> 16:11.585
Hey! I said, no fainting!
No fainting! Okay!

16:11.756 --> 16:13.380
Run the fluids in over two hours.

16:13.549 --> 16:16.587
And give him 50 of Librium
for the shakes.

16:20.557 --> 16:22.385
- Abby?
- What?

16:22.560 --> 16:24.718
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah.

16:28.442 --> 16:30.898
You want a blood-alcohol level?

16:31.362 --> 16:33.569
Just a liver panel.

16:38.161 --> 16:40.997
- Did you find your sweater?
- Yeah.

16:41.207 --> 16:44.078
Good. I thought
you maybe had some trouble.

16:44.919 --> 16:47.292
- Why would you think that?
- I haven't seen you.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.042
- Well, we've been busy.
- Yeah.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.416
Abby, I'm sorry if I hurt you.
I didn't want to.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.338
You didn't hurt me.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.139
I just want you to be happy, Abby.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.310
You never seemed
to be happy with me.

17:00.188 --> 17:03.189
- That's all I wanted to say.
- Well, you said it.

17:04.025 --> 17:05.603
Yeah.

17:08.113 --> 17:09.394
So, what now?

17:14.621 --> 17:16.246
You tell me.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.083
Should I send a ProTime?

17:20.377 --> 17:22.002
Yeah.

17:23.298 --> 17:24.876
- What's your biggest angiocath?
-14-gauge.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.710
Give it to me.

17:29.513 --> 17:32.634
- What are you gonna do?
- Retrograde intubation.

17:36.063 --> 17:37.771
Hold that.

17:37.939 --> 17:42.187
The wire should come out the mouth.

17:44.656 --> 17:47.776
- Okay, hold on to that, sparky.
- I got the line.

17:47.952 --> 17:49.825
Squeeze in a liter.

17:54.167 --> 17:57.122
Hold on to that.
Don't stick anyone.

17:57.296 --> 18:00.297
And tube.

18:01.301 --> 18:02.581
I said, tube!

18:08.517 --> 18:10.177
Doctors are human.
We make mistakes.

18:10.352 --> 18:12.310
If this guy
had been properly diagnosed...

18:12.480 --> 18:15.850
...and sent straight to the O.R.,
he'd be flipping burgers at McDonald's.

18:16.026 --> 18:18.778
Marfan's is difficult to detect.
Residents had never heard-

18:18.863 --> 18:21.651
- Which is why we have Attendings.
- I can't be everywhere.

18:21.783 --> 18:23.526
Wrong answer!

18:23.743 --> 18:26.151
The Trib is writing a feature story
on this screwup...

18:26.288 --> 18:27.997
...and the rise
in preventable deaths.

18:28.165 --> 18:30.871
So come up with a better excuse
than "doctors are human"...

18:31.044 --> 18:33.879
...or find yourself
a good old-fashioned scapegoat.

18:38.219 --> 18:39.630
- Let me out.
- Hurry up.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.426
- We got good breath sounds.
- Very cool.

18:42.598 --> 18:44.638
Who's your daddy?

18:45.185 --> 18:46.810
She's pinking up.

18:46.979 --> 18:50.313
She's breathing quietly without
retractions. Heart rate's normal at 140.

18:50.482 --> 18:52.227
- Temperature's up to 97.
- All right.

18:52.402 --> 18:55.072
Someone's got to call
Social Services and DCFS.

18:55.238 --> 18:57.730
This little girl's gonna need
foster placement.

18:57.908 --> 18:59.403
Dr. Carter?

18:59.493 --> 19:02.448
This is Mirissa.
She's the woman who found the baby.

19:02.539 --> 19:04.698
- She wanted to know how she's doing.
- Very well.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.330
Good thing you found her.
Would you like to see her?

19:07.503 --> 19:09.662
- This is my sister Carmine.
- Hi.

19:09.839 --> 19:13.540
Doctor, can you show my sister
the mark on her chest?

19:13.719 --> 19:16.755
The birthmark? Oh, yeah.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.302
There you go.

19:30.614 --> 19:33.365
Doctor, thank you.

19:33.534 --> 19:35.442
Thank you.

19:39.623 --> 19:41.700
Okay. Did I just miss something?

19:41.877 --> 19:45.791
She thinks the birthmark
is the sign of the Virgin Mary.

19:46.423 --> 19:49.294
It does look like a bleeding heart.

19:52.556 --> 19:54.015
Hey, John.

19:54.182 --> 19:55.807
- Thanks for the help.
- Anytime.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.100
No, no, really.

19:58.312 --> 20:00.103
Anytime.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.227
Hey.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.812
Can I get you a cane?

20:03.986 --> 20:06.228
I've heard that women
find helplessness charming.

20:06.321 --> 20:08.648
- In puppies maybe.
- Are you still evading Luka?

20:08.825 --> 20:11.150
No. Well, yeah, sort of.
It's complicated.

20:11.327 --> 20:13.819
- Most breakups are.
- Here, sit down.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.998
Well, not that way.

20:18.753 --> 20:23.665
This morning, I had to go over
to his place to get one of my sweaters.

20:23.884 --> 20:26.292
And I smashed his fish tank.

20:26.470 --> 20:29.341
- Why?
- It was an accident.

20:30.099 --> 20:32.591
- Did you replace it?
- No, not yet. I haven't told him.

20:32.769 --> 20:34.477
Is it too broken to fix?

20:34.604 --> 20:36.847
It was more like a crack.

20:37.442 --> 20:40.396
- You want some lidocaine?
- No.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.398
Just do it.

20:46.368 --> 20:48.825
That is one big piece of glass.

20:49.789 --> 20:52.790
You really should replace it.
He's gonna think you're a little...

20:52.917 --> 20:54.578
- ... vindictive.
- It wasn't like that.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.545
- I know.
- I'm getting him another one.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.956
- I think that's a great idea.
- I just need help...

20:59.133 --> 21:00.758
...getting it into his apartment.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.633
- Don't even.
- Come on. I can't lift it up by myself.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.964
We get there and replace it
before he gets home.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.300
You tell Luka what happened
and the two of you-

21:08.478 --> 21:10.720
May I remind you I removed a thorn
from your paw?

21:10.897 --> 21:12.771
John, did you discharge Ravitz?

21:12.941 --> 21:15.183
- Who? All right. I'll think about it.
- I owe you.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.148
Twenty-two-year-old with chest pains,
taking birth control.

21:18.323 --> 21:22.321
- Yeah. Yeah, why?
- Well, Weaver took her from me.

21:23.287 --> 21:24.567
She gave her to you?

21:24.747 --> 21:26.740
Maybe she thought you were swamped.

21:26.916 --> 21:28.909
Yeah, more like incompetent.

21:29.085 --> 21:32.205
She made you Chief Resident.
You know, you're the chosen one.

21:32.381 --> 21:34.588
Yeah, by default.

21:35.426 --> 21:37.419
We met when we were kids.

21:37.595 --> 21:39.754
Her family had
the cottage next to ours.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.723
We used to go water-skiing together.

21:41.892 --> 21:44.562
But now she can't feed
or dress herself.

21:44.728 --> 21:47.814
And she doesn't even recognize me.

21:47.982 --> 21:49.940
What will happen if we don't operate?

21:50.819 --> 21:54.603
Her appendix will burst, and
she'll develop a life-threatening infection.

21:55.741 --> 21:59.111
- Is that a painful way to die?
- She doesn't have to die, Mr. Tanzi.

21:59.287 --> 22:03.037
- It's a fixable condition.
- I'm not so sure she wants to be fixed.

22:03.292 --> 22:06.043
It's a simple surgery, Mr. Tanzi.

22:06.212 --> 22:10.507
Look, I don't want her to suffer,
but I want to let her go.

22:10.675 --> 22:13.843
- Can you do that?
- Sure we can.

22:14.889 --> 22:18.554
Let's give her 5 milligrams of morphine.
Keep her hydrated.

22:20.144 --> 22:21.972
Excuse me.

22:23.983 --> 22:26.271
Mark, are you not going to try
and convince him?

22:26.443 --> 22:27.772
He has power of attorney.

22:27.946 --> 22:29.226
- It's his decision.
- Dad.

22:29.406 --> 22:30.735
- Yes, I know, but-
- Dad?

22:30.824 --> 22:32.484
- What's wrong?
- I called her.

22:32.659 --> 22:34.403
- Yeah.
- She started freaking out.

22:34.578 --> 22:37.472
I told you. All she ever cares about
is her stupid job!

22:37.507 --> 22:40.216
- She's gonna send me to summer school.
- Call if you need me.

22:40.293 --> 22:42.750
- And I swear I'm adopted!
- Rachel, what did she say?

22:42.921 --> 22:45.839
She started yelling at me!
She hates me. She's such a bitch.

22:46.008 --> 22:47.918
- Rachel.
- You don't know what she's like.

22:48.094 --> 22:49.553
- You don't live with her.
- I did.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.390
- You couldn't stand it either.
- Mark, we got a GSW coming.

22:52.558 --> 22:55.096
- I'll be there.
- Prep the Trauma Room. Where's Malucci?

22:55.269 --> 22:56.680
Said he was going to Radiology.

22:58.356 --> 23:01.441
- What are they waiting for?
-104's bringing them.

23:09.786 --> 23:11.909
- Chief!
- You're fired.

23:12.163 --> 23:13.824
- I'm on my break.
- I'm between calls.

23:13.999 --> 23:17.826
Go home, Malucci.
And get this rig out of here.

23:20.508 --> 23:22.833
What are we talking?
You want to suspend me a week?

23:23.010 --> 23:26.094
- You no longer work here.
- What do you want? A formal apology?

23:26.263 --> 23:28.551
- I want you to empty out your locker.
- What?

23:28.723 --> 23:31.973
Dr. Chen, you need to check the baby.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.434
Calm down. She's here.
Want to talk to her?

23:35.563 --> 23:36.844
- No!
- When do you get in?

23:37.023 --> 23:39.692
- I don't want her to come.
- She's calling from the plane.

23:39.775 --> 23:42.064
- I'm not going with her.
- Don't yell at me.

23:42.152 --> 23:45.153
I didn't tell her to come here.
Okay, okay. Yeah, I gotta run.

23:45.321 --> 23:47.314
We'll figure it out
when you get here. Bye.

23:47.490 --> 23:49.815
- She was freaking out, wasn't she?
- She's worried.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.068
Mr. O'Groat, Mr. O'Groat.
Where are you going?

23:52.244 --> 23:54.201
- To the game.
- I need to check your x-ray.

23:54.372 --> 23:56.908
- I'm good to go.
- You may have separated your shoulder.

23:57.082 --> 24:00.166
- It's okay. I saw the baby. Cheers.
- What baby?

24:00.334 --> 24:02.208
- Are you taking her side?
- What? No.

24:02.379 --> 24:04.039
Can you talk to Weaver?
She fired me.

24:04.213 --> 24:05.411
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

24:05.589 --> 24:06.918
I don't even want to see her!

24:07.091 --> 24:08.585
- Why are you still here?
- See?

24:08.759 --> 24:10.550
- What's going on?
- He's out of here.

24:10.719 --> 24:12.178
- Dr. Greene.
- Just a second.

24:12.345 --> 24:14.384
- You gonna talk to her?
- My wife's gone.

24:14.556 --> 24:16.050
- What?
- I went to call our son.

24:16.223 --> 24:17.552
When I got back, she was gone.

24:17.725 --> 24:19.932
- Maybe the nurses took her.
- Her walker's gone.

24:20.102 --> 24:22.807
- She couldn't have gone far.
- Last time she wandered off...

24:22.980 --> 24:25.518
- ... she nearly got hit by a car.
- Randi, call Security.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.564
His wife might be missing.
We'll find her.

24:27.735 --> 24:29.810
- Dad, I want to stay with you.
- Not now!

24:29.986 --> 24:33.936
- So you'll talk to her, then, right?
- You talk to her. She didn't fire me.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.198
- You ready?
- One more patient.

24:37.367 --> 24:39.526
I'll be in the car.
I don't want Luka to see us.

24:39.703 --> 24:42.241
- We gonna wear ski masks?
- Thank you for calling me.

24:43.414 --> 24:46.250
- Yes.
- Did you win the lottery?

24:46.417 --> 24:49.869
Better. My labs came back.
My HIV test is non-reactive.

24:50.046 --> 24:53.580
- Hey, congratulations. Great.
- I have to take it again in three months.

24:53.757 --> 24:56.758
If you haven't converted by now,
chances are you probably won't.

24:57.218 --> 25:00.753
- God, I feel like I just got my life back.
- I don't think this is working.

25:01.597 --> 25:03.554
- Give it time, Yolanda.
- What's this?

25:03.724 --> 25:06.595
Oh, she just had an allergic reaction
to some meat.

25:06.769 --> 25:09.639
She'd probably breathe easier
if you took the corset off her.

25:09.854 --> 25:11.432
Be my guest.

25:11.857 --> 25:13.398
No, thank you.

25:13.567 --> 25:16.437
Slow, deep breaths, Yolanda.

25:16.611 --> 25:19.232
- You got this?
- Yeah, sure.

25:20.197 --> 25:23.947
- What happened? She dropped her sats?
- Sinus tach. Heart rate's 180.

25:24.118 --> 25:26.608
- Is she dehydrated?
- Well, definitely not dry.

25:26.787 --> 25:28.944
- She's making good urine.
- Spike a fever?

25:29.121 --> 25:32.158
Repeat temp is 98.4.
Chuny, I need that hemoglobin.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.906
- It's coming.
- Last one was 12.2.

25:35.085 --> 25:37.955
She's not anemic.
You're not anemic, are you?

25:38.130 --> 25:41.629
- Did you check a tox screen?
- Negative.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.255
Maybe she's worn out
from performing those miracles.

25:44.427 --> 25:47.048
Second HemoCue is 8.2.

25:47.221 --> 25:50.424
- I knew she was looking pale.
- Well, that's too low to be dilutional.

25:50.599 --> 25:52.970
- It might be hemolysis.
- Or Gl blood loss.

25:53.143 --> 25:54.803
I'll check a stool guaiac.

25:54.978 --> 25:57.017
What are you doing out of bed, dear?

25:57.188 --> 25:58.682
The baby was crying.

25:58.856 --> 26:02.355
Well, let's get you back to your room,
all right? All right.

26:02.526 --> 26:06.355
Send off a retic count, haptoglobin,
Coombs, direct and indirect bilirubin.

26:06.530 --> 26:09.649
I want to transfuse 2 cc per kilo per hour
over the next five hours.

26:09.825 --> 26:11.069
That's a good pickup.

26:11.242 --> 26:13.993
I would never have thought
to repeat the blood count so soon.

26:14.162 --> 26:15.822
Tachycardia will resolve with transfusion.

26:15.914 --> 26:17.573
Baby's anemic, you give blood.

26:17.748 --> 26:20.500
It's not exactly one for the journals.

26:22.294 --> 26:26.161
- What?
- Thanks, Carter. That was great.

26:28.007 --> 26:30.842
- Where was she?
- Wandering the halls, apparently.

26:31.010 --> 26:33.927
I was detained by Malucci,
who seems to think he's out of a job.

26:34.096 --> 26:36.503
- He is.
- The baby was crying.

26:36.681 --> 26:38.508
What happened?
Why is she so much better?

26:38.684 --> 26:40.510
Her appendix probably burst.

26:40.685 --> 26:44.019
Once the pressure's relieved,
the pain temporarily goes away.

26:44.188 --> 26:46.394
- For how long?
- Within 24 hours...

26:46.565 --> 26:48.475
...peritonitis will take over.

26:48.651 --> 26:52.862
Causes high fevers
and severe abdominal pain.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.605
Thank you for taking care
of me, Lawrence.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.273
You know,
Malucci is not the first doctor...

26:58.451 --> 27:01.701
...to get caught performing
an unauthorized physical in the hospital.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.243
- She knows I've been taking care of her.
- Excuse me?

27:04.873 --> 27:08.040
It's been two years
since she's said my name.

27:08.209 --> 27:11.126
- Is it too late to perform the surgery?
- She's perforated.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.580
We'd have to do an open procedure,
which will take much longer to heal.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.544
I want you to operate.

27:17.217 --> 27:21.594
Mr. Tanzi, your wife's moment of lucidity
was probably a fluke.

27:21.764 --> 27:23.720
The surgeon says
it's a simple operation.

27:24.057 --> 27:25.966
Why don't you stay here
with your wife...

27:26.143 --> 27:29.392
...and we'll have the surgeon come
down and speak with you, all right?

27:29.561 --> 27:33.310
- She deserves to have everything done.
- She will.

27:38.570 --> 27:40.063
What are you doing?

27:40.238 --> 27:43.025
His wife's end-stage dementia.
I'm trying to help them.

27:43.199 --> 27:46.698
- Well, apparently, you're not.
- You want this one too? She's yours.

27:46.869 --> 27:49.906
Why don't you take all the patients,
seeing that you're firing all the doctors.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.907
- He had it coming.
- For what?

27:52.082 --> 27:53.873
Unacceptable behavior,
insubordination.

27:54.042 --> 27:58.370
- I mean, he has no respect for anything.
- So what? Reprimand him.

27:58.545 --> 28:00.088
I am tired of his attitude.

28:00.255 --> 28:02.924
You can't get rid of him
just because you don't get along.

28:03.092 --> 28:05.084
If that were the case,
you'd fire all of us.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.798
You know what?
I'm not gonna justify my point of view!

28:09.347 --> 28:13.296
- Where is she?
- Good to see you too, Jen.

28:17.271 --> 28:21.564
- Don't break it.
- You owe me so big for this.

28:22.316 --> 28:24.274
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

28:24.610 --> 28:26.318
I left the keys in the apartment.

28:27.613 --> 28:29.570
That's it. Mission aborted.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.981
Wait. Hold it. Wait.

28:32.617 --> 28:35.572
- He sleeps with the window open.
- Wouldn't it make more sense...

28:35.746 --> 28:38.117
- ... to leave it out front?
- So someone can steal it?

28:38.290 --> 28:39.866
Who steals a fish tank?

28:40.041 --> 28:43.412
- Come to think of it, who breaks one?
- I told you, it was an accident.

28:43.586 --> 28:44.830
That's good.

28:45.003 --> 28:48.253
Okay, that's Luka's.

28:49.049 --> 28:52.299
- Can you give me a boost up there?
- No.

28:52.885 --> 28:56.965
- Just bend over.
- You could at least buy me dinner first.

28:57.223 --> 28:59.215
- I got a bad back.
- What are you-?

28:59.392 --> 29:01.763
- What are you implying?
- What if somebody sees us?

29:01.936 --> 29:03.727
All right. Just relax, Opie.

29:03.896 --> 29:06.351
- Are you ready? Okay.
- Yes.

29:08.816 --> 29:12.267
Wait. Okay. It's stuck.

29:13.112 --> 29:17.192
- Sorry. It's stuck.
- Carter!

29:17.365 --> 29:19.239
She doesn't listen.
She ignores curfew.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.200
She doesn't do a thing
around the house.

29:21.369 --> 29:23.243
How would you know?
You're never home.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.820
I just made partner.
Excuse me for working so hard...

29:25.998 --> 29:27.658
...so I can put a roof
over your head.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.113
- You made partner?
- Yeah.

29:29.293 --> 29:30.538
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

29:30.710 --> 29:33.665
- Dad!
- Rachel, sit down.

29:33.839 --> 29:36.756
Obviously, there is
a lack of communication here.

29:36.924 --> 29:41.135
Sounds like to me, Rachel,
you could be a little more responsible.

29:41.303 --> 29:43.380
Jen, maybe you could spend
some more time-

29:43.556 --> 29:45.761
- I am responsible!
- I've given her 14 years.

29:45.933 --> 29:48.684
- I am tired of being her maid.
- Tired of being a mother.

29:48.852 --> 29:51.010
- Can you blame me?
- All right, time-out.

29:51.188 --> 29:53.809
We'll finish this at home.
We get on a plane at 5:30.

29:54.691 --> 29:56.600
Maybe I'm not going back.

29:56.776 --> 29:59.231
Rachel, I had to cancel
my whole day to be here.

29:59.403 --> 30:01.692
And now I'm gonna be up
all night doing a brief.

30:01.864 --> 30:05.232
Well, I'm sorry
I'm such a pain in the ass.

30:08.202 --> 30:10.528
Dr. Greene, we need you.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.832
Remember when she used to
push crayons down the toilet?

30:15.542 --> 30:18.080
Seriously, Mark,
you've gotta help me here.

30:18.587 --> 30:20.413
Now, doctor.

30:22.048 --> 30:24.040
I'll be right back.

30:27.553 --> 30:29.795
Auto versus pedestrian
at moderate velocity.

30:29.972 --> 30:32.213
Altered, with GCS of 2-4-4.
BP is 80 palp.

30:32.390 --> 30:35.423
Full trauma panel, type and cross
for four. Sign of head trauma?

30:35.601 --> 30:36.882
Nothing I appreciated.

30:37.061 --> 30:39.517
Witnesses say she was lying
in the crosswalk when hit.

30:39.689 --> 30:42.475
- May have been struck more than once.
- Set up a central line.

30:42.649 --> 30:44.378
Pulse ox, 98 on 2 liters.

30:44.413 --> 30:45.974
Contusion, left-upper quadrant.

30:46.009 --> 30:49.018
- Pupils, 4 millimeters and reactive.
- Dr. Benton?

30:49.197 --> 30:50.988
We got a severed umbilical cord.

30:51.157 --> 30:52.817
- Where's the baby?
- There is no baby.

30:52.992 --> 30:57.037
- She's got a retained placenta.
- Okay. I'll try to extract. Call OB.

30:57.204 --> 30:59.362
She's missing a shoelace.

30:59.456 --> 31:01.449
- Resuscitate?
- He's been down too long.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.249
- Flush him?
- Think Luka will miss him?

31:03.418 --> 31:06.749
- He'll think one of the other fish ate him.
- They're not piranha.

31:06.921 --> 31:09.458
- Fine.
- I was never any good with pets.

31:09.632 --> 31:11.956
I used to like those turtles
at the Woolworth's.

31:12.134 --> 31:14.755
- Don't they carry salmonella?
- I don't know.

31:14.928 --> 31:17.336
Didn't live long if you paint them
with nail polish.

31:17.514 --> 31:18.676
Can we get out of here now?

31:18.765 --> 31:21.090
I have to wipe the place down for prints.

31:27.731 --> 31:29.724
- Should I get it?
- No.

31:40.409 --> 31:43.612
- No pneumothorax.
- You ready with the ultrasound?

31:43.787 --> 31:47.784
All set. Systolic's up to 100.
She's coming around.

31:47.957 --> 31:50.792
- I'm Dr. Greene. What's your name?
- Anna. What happened?

31:50.960 --> 31:53.747
- You were hit by a car.
- My stomach hurts.

31:53.921 --> 31:55.997
Where's your baby?

31:56.173 --> 31:57.335
I don't have a baby.

31:57.424 --> 31:59.796
Crit's only 28 after 2 units.

31:59.968 --> 32:01.130
Hang another 2.

32:01.303 --> 32:02.465
- She needs a splenectomy.
- What?

32:02.637 --> 32:04.463
- You need an operation.
- Why?

32:04.638 --> 32:06.678
You have internal bleeding
from the accident.

32:06.849 --> 32:10.348
- And you haven't delivered your placenta.
- No, I'm not pregnant.

32:10.519 --> 32:11.800
You were.

32:11.979 --> 32:15.145
- Did you leave your baby at the church?
- I don't have a baby.

32:15.482 --> 32:17.024
- I'm taking her up.
- Hold on.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.063
- How's she doing?
- Oh, crit's up.

32:23.239 --> 32:26.488
- But she needs another 4 per kilo.
- I need to take her for a second.

32:26.658 --> 32:28.947
- What? Take her where?
- Just next door.

32:29.118 --> 32:30.661
She needs more packed cells.

32:30.828 --> 32:33.995
Send off another CBC from Pre-Op,
and I want plasma in the O.R.

32:34.165 --> 32:35.991
- Wait.
- Her pressure's borderline.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.953
- I gotta take her.
- I need to put her back on the monitors.

32:39.669 --> 32:43.998
- Anna, this is your baby.
- I don't have any children.

32:44.173 --> 32:47.507
You tied off her umbilical cord
with your own shoelace.

32:47.676 --> 32:50.429
- No.
- We need to finish the transfusion.

32:50.596 --> 32:55.304
You left her at the church
because you wanted her to be safe.

32:59.521 --> 33:02.806
- I can't have a baby.
- But you did.

33:05.526 --> 33:08.895
- Is she okay?
- She's very sick.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.653
But we're helping her now.

33:13.991 --> 33:15.865
I never meant to hurt her.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.360
I thought God would protect her.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.988
He did. Some people think
she's a miracle.

33:22.791 --> 33:24.023
What?

33:24.334 --> 33:26.208
They feel better when they're near her.

33:31.716 --> 33:33.174
Can I touch her?

33:33.884 --> 33:35.921
Yeah. Go ahead.

34:01.647 --> 34:04.397
- What are you doing, ordering pizza?
- I'm calling my lawyer.

34:04.565 --> 34:05.644
They haven't charged us.

34:05.732 --> 34:07.771
We're sitting in the back of a police car.

34:07.942 --> 34:09.851
What are they gonna arrest us for?

34:09.944 --> 34:11.058
Aquatic mischief?

34:11.152 --> 34:12.860
Hope you're this funny in handcuffs.

34:12.987 --> 34:14.266
I am.

34:16.572 --> 34:18.978
Oh, here we go.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.112
- He looks pissed.
- You think he's gonna press charges?

34:22.284 --> 34:25.485
- I don't know. We did kill his fish.
- We?

34:25.829 --> 34:29.492
- Oh, he's really pissed.
- I'm making my phone call now.

34:30.831 --> 34:33.830
All right, Bonnie and Clyde,
your friend cut you loose.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.706
Stay out of trouble.

34:35.876 --> 34:38.447
- Should we say something?
- You should say something.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.828
Maybe tomorrow.

34:45.965 --> 34:50.175
Rachel, your mom's waiting out front
for a taxi.

34:51.135 --> 34:52.842
Thanks.

34:55.388 --> 34:57.878
I know growing up can be tough.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.049
You can call me anytime.

35:00.224 --> 35:03.057
Yeah, until Mom takes away
my phone privileges again.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.172
It'll be okay.

35:05.727 --> 35:07.221
No, it won't.

35:10.146 --> 35:12.683
Rachel, what do you want me to do?

35:13.690 --> 35:15.895
You could let me stay here.

35:16.066 --> 35:19.434
- You can't.
- Why not?

35:19.610 --> 35:22.445
- Your mom would miss you.
- Right.

35:22.612 --> 35:26.690
- You'd miss your friends.
- They're only a phone call away.

35:27.323 --> 35:29.114
I'll make new ones.

35:29.283 --> 35:33.279
- What about school?
- They have schools in Chicago.

35:33.911 --> 35:36.318
I just want to spend more time
with you and Ella.

35:39.414 --> 35:42.331
I've got a baby sister
who doesn't even know me.

35:42.499 --> 35:45.415
And Elizabeth is totally smart and cool.

35:45.585 --> 35:47.659
I mean, she's a great role model.

35:47.919 --> 35:51.369
- Are you serious about this?
- Yes.

35:52.505 --> 35:53.916
It's a big move.

35:56.048 --> 35:58.206
I miss you, Dad.

36:00.801 --> 36:02.509
I'll talk to your mother.

36:07.264 --> 36:09.091
Straight clamp, then 2-0 Vicryl.

36:09.265 --> 36:12.099
Any chance we could speed this up?
I got tickets to the Cubs game.

36:12.267 --> 36:14.259
If you're asking me to compromise
surgery...

36:14.435 --> 36:17.933
...in order for you to attend
a sporting event, the answer is no.

36:18.104 --> 36:19.597
I did a pre-op assessment on her.

36:19.772 --> 36:23.388
I've had more intelligent conversations
with my neighbor's cat.

36:23.566 --> 36:26.934
- I need to irrigate with 2 liters.
- I've only got 500 cc's on the field.

36:27.109 --> 36:30.358
- Then get us some more.
- Coming right up.

36:30.528 --> 36:34.939
Maybe this is God's way of saying
her meter's out.

36:35.114 --> 36:38.398
If I get to this point, I sure as hell
don't want a trip to the O.R.

36:38.575 --> 36:40.234
I'll keep that in mind, Dr. Babcock.

36:40.409 --> 36:43.574
Whatever happened
to dignity in death?

36:44.537 --> 36:46.327
Elizabeth?

36:49.039 --> 36:51.114
Dr. Corday?

36:51.290 --> 36:53.994
- Where's my saline, Shirley?
- Ready to go.

36:54.542 --> 36:56.250
Right, then.

36:56.419 --> 36:58.706
Did you just fall asleep?

36:59.003 --> 37:00.794
- No.
- You did.

37:00.963 --> 37:02.670
You fell asleep.

37:02.839 --> 37:04.961
I was resting my eyes.

37:07.092 --> 37:10.126
Peter, you missed a good one.
Seven gunshots.

37:10.219 --> 37:12.009
Looked like a scavenger hunt.
What've you got?

37:12.178 --> 37:14.929
Twenty-year-old with fractured spleen
and retained placenta.

37:15.097 --> 37:16.638
- Call Coburn?
- She's on her way.

37:16.805 --> 37:19.592
She's gonna try manual extraction
under general anesthesia.

37:19.766 --> 37:21.473
Hopefully it's not an accreta.

37:21.642 --> 37:25.175
Dr. Benton, there's a young man
out here looking for you.

37:32.774 --> 37:34.481
Jackie?

37:34.942 --> 37:37.610
- I'm sorry, Peter.
- What's wrong?

37:37.776 --> 37:40.860
I can't do this. Not right now.

37:41.029 --> 37:43.862
- I'm getting ready to go into surgery.
- I tried. I really did.

37:44.030 --> 37:47.113
Okay, listen. Why don't we just talk
about this when I get home.

37:47.282 --> 37:49.772
Reece is the sweetest little boy
I know.

37:49.950 --> 37:52.903
I love him like he was mine.

37:53.494 --> 37:55.118
- But he's not mine.
- Yeah, I know.

37:55.287 --> 37:57.859
And every time I see him-

37:59.873 --> 38:01.367
It's just not fair.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.077
Jackie?

38:05.251 --> 38:07.409
- Jackie!
- Is he scrubbing in with you, Peter?

38:07.586 --> 38:09.910
I just need to find somebody
to keep an eye on him.

38:10.088 --> 38:12.126
- Don't look at me.
- I'm gonna go to daycare.

38:12.297 --> 38:13.756
- I'll be back.
- I don't think so.

38:13.923 --> 38:15.915
Go home.
Get your personal life sorted out.

38:16.091 --> 38:18.332
- I'm going to perform a splenectomy.
- Not anymore.

38:18.510 --> 38:20.465
She stands a better chance
if I do it. Go.

38:20.636 --> 38:23.754
Spend some quality time with your son
at Chuck E. Cheese or something.

38:53.238 --> 38:54.780
Hey.

38:56.407 --> 39:00.355
- Weaver change her mind?
- No. Not yet.

39:00.577 --> 39:03.529
She will.
She's just mad at you.

39:04.204 --> 39:07.820
She's always mad at me.
This is different.

39:08.372 --> 39:10.944
Well, maybe it'll blow over.

39:12.041 --> 39:13.868
You know, I-

39:15.043 --> 39:17.035
I should have seen it.

39:18.045 --> 39:20.831
I didn't focus on the mediastinum. I-

39:21.005 --> 39:25.795
- I didn't even look at the x-ray, Dave.
- Because I told you it was clear.

39:27.634 --> 39:31.001
I mean, I thought I was doing
the right thing. I just-

39:31.178 --> 39:34.094
I just wanted to save the guy and-

39:35.555 --> 39:38.259
You know, they say you're not
a real doctor...

39:38.432 --> 39:40.555
...until you've killed a few patients.

39:46.896 --> 39:48.175
What are you gonna do?

39:50.439 --> 39:53.772
This is the only thing
that I've ever been any good at.

39:59.152 --> 40:00.433
I'm gonna be a doctor.

40:03.572 --> 40:06.109
You were never arrested
or brought home by the police...

40:06.282 --> 40:08.855
- ... or anything when you were a kid?
- No. Were you?

40:09.034 --> 40:11.275
Well, not for anything serious.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.072
What, no counterfeiting?
No grand-theft auto?

40:14.245 --> 40:16.652
Actually, I did get in trouble
for taking this car.

40:16.830 --> 40:19.237
- You stole a car?
- Barely. It was a Gremlin.

40:19.415 --> 40:22.083
And I was only borrowing it anyway.

40:22.250 --> 40:26.198
- What, no high-speed chases involved?
- Well, a short one.

40:26.378 --> 40:28.950
It was an emergency.
We had to get Wham! tickets.

40:29.046 --> 40:30.918
Now, that's a crime.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.417
Do you want to come in
for a coffee or something?

40:34.591 --> 40:36.879
- No. I gotta get up early.
- Okay.

40:37.051 --> 40:39.458
Well, thanks for helping me.

40:39.636 --> 40:41.923
You can find yourself
another wheelman next time.

40:42.095 --> 40:45.961
That's too bad, because I had my eye
on this liquor store on the corner.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.890
- You heard the cop. "Stay out of trouble. "
- All right.

40:50.142 --> 40:51.884
Got it.

40:57.313 --> 40:59.435
Sorry I almost got you arrested.

41:00.064 --> 41:03.432
You walk outside there, you gonna
find all your stuff on the street!

41:03.608 --> 41:05.849
- My upstairs neighbors.
- Sound like nice people.

41:06.026 --> 41:08.101
- They're at it again.
- Yeah.

41:08.277 --> 41:09.772
Somebody should go up there.

41:09.946 --> 41:13.360
I'm sure they'll settle down in a minute,
Mrs. Gottschuck.

41:13.614 --> 41:15.690
Why don't you go back to bed.

41:18.409 --> 41:21.859
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, good night.

41:22.036 --> 41:23.862
You're gonna tell Luka
this was your idea.

41:24.037 --> 41:27.120
Yes. I'm not gonna
drop a dime on you, Carter.

41:28.164 --> 41:30.121
- You look beat.
- I am.

41:30.291 --> 41:32.662
How was Mrs. Tanzi's appendectomy?

41:32.751 --> 41:33.948
Uneventful.

41:34.126 --> 41:36.795
- Hey, Rachel's still here.
- Yeah.

41:36.962 --> 41:40.664
- I thought Jen was coming to get her.
- Things didn't go quite as planned.

41:40.839 --> 41:42.748
- How's that?
- As in, how do you feel...

41:42.840 --> 41:46.088
- ... about Rachel staying with us a while?
- For the rest of the summer?

41:46.259 --> 41:48.167
Maybe. Maybe longer.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.716
Could be handy
having a live-in babysitter.

41:51.887 --> 41:53.926
And I'm sure she'll help
around the house.

41:54.096 --> 41:55.970
She's your daughter, Mark.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.630
Of course she's welcome
to live with us.

41:58.808 --> 42:03.100
The fact that she's still here suggests
you've already told her she could.

42:03.269 --> 42:08.308
- You were in surgery.
- So do you guys have a satellite dish?

42:08.481 --> 42:10.140
No.

42:13.108 --> 42:14.815
No singed nasal hairs.

42:14.984 --> 42:18.103
If you lean back far enough,
the flame burns away from your face.

42:18.278 --> 42:20.850
- That's the key to fire-eating.
- So, what happened today?

42:21.029 --> 42:23.983
Usually, I smear my mustache
with Vaseline.

42:24.157 --> 42:27.072
Today, I forgot it,
so I used hair gel instead.

42:27.617 --> 42:30.616
- I guess it was flammable.
- Guess so.

42:31.119 --> 42:34.035
Let's shave off the rest of the mustache
and débride the skin.

42:34.204 --> 42:36.326
You can't shave my mustache.
It's my trademark.

42:36.497 --> 42:39.331
- Dude, it's half gone.
- I'll get an extension or something.

42:39.499 --> 42:41.823
- I'll give you Neosporin.
- Give this to Dr. Carter.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.577
- He left.
- Give it to someone else.

42:43.752 --> 42:45.494
Look, chief, I know you're pissed.

42:45.669 --> 42:47.044
But let's be real about this.

42:47.212 --> 42:50.295
If you really want to ax me,
you go through the review committee...

42:50.464 --> 42:53.043
...and disciplinary committee.
They'd want to counsel me.

42:53.216 --> 42:56.631
- The best you'll get is suspension.
- You have five letters in your file...

42:56.801 --> 42:59.256
- ... for unprofessional behavior.
- Me and every doctor.

42:59.428 --> 43:01.716
You've been counseled.
You failed two rotations.

43:01.887 --> 43:04.555
There will be a meeting
of the Residency Review Committee.

43:04.722 --> 43:07.260
They will offer you counseling,
but I am telling you...

43:07.433 --> 43:10.006
- ... you will never work in this ER.
- What's your problem?

43:10.184 --> 43:12.934
- You. You're my problem.
- Because I don't kiss your ass?

43:13.103 --> 43:15.307
I mean, yeah,
I like to have fun sometimes.

43:15.479 --> 43:18.432
I'm a damn good doctor.
I had a half a dozen great saves today.

43:18.605 --> 43:21.178
- Being a doctor is more than great saves.
- Really? What?

43:21.358 --> 43:24.392
I need to adopt your cheery attitude
and sparkling bedside manner?

43:24.567 --> 43:26.773
Hey, this isn't about
my performance, is it?

43:26.944 --> 43:30.644
- Or my rotations. You just don't like me.
- You're right. I don't like you.

43:30.822 --> 43:34.355
You have no respect for me,
your coworkers, this hospital, anything.

43:34.532 --> 43:37.531
You think you have this whole cowboy
approach to medicine.

43:37.701 --> 43:39.739
But you don't have the goods
to back it up.

43:39.910 --> 43:43.360
So you make mistakes.
Mistakes that kill people.

43:43.537 --> 43:47.368
I need this job. You can't fire me.
I have a kid to support.

43:50.792 --> 43:53.993
Since when? You never said anything
about being a father.

43:54.877 --> 43:56.335
Did you ever ask?

43:58.839 --> 44:02.122
- You don't know a damn thing about me.
- Well, I know you're fired.

44:02.466 --> 44:04.670
You're a sad, cold-hearted bitch!
You know that?

44:04.842 --> 44:06.999
- Somebody call Security.
- Nobody here likes you.

44:07.177 --> 44:08.836
- Get out!
- Know why this stupid ER...

44:09.011 --> 44:11.168
...is so damn important to you?
Do you know why?

44:11.346 --> 44:14.511
Because it's the only thing
that you've got in your life.

44:14.681 --> 44:16.752
Nazi dyke.
