00:34.159 --> 00:36.619
Who's getting chocolate milk
if he sits still?

00:36.703 --> 00:40.290
I'm getting chocolate milk if I sit still.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.208
Uh...

00:42.292 --> 00:45.587
Hey, Bobby, how'd you like to come
to the barber shop with me tomorrow?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.299
I don't think it's up to you, Hank.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.467
Or you, Bobby.

00:50.467 --> 00:54.679
Peggy, you've put in 12 great years
cutting Bobby's hair...

00:54.763 --> 00:56.973
and he's been very good about it.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.976
But Bobby's a big boy now
and I think he can handle seeing

01:00.060 --> 01:02.937
those copies of Esquire
Jack has lying around.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.647
I get to go to Jack?

01:04.731 --> 01:07.817
Bobby, you start going to him now,
maybe in a couple of years

01:07.901 --> 01:09.152
you can call him Jack.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.156
You can help me pick out
my new haircut, Mom.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.492
We'll talk about it over chocolate milk.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.077
Chocolate milk? Oh, no.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.704
You're much too big a boy
for chocolate milk.

01:27.295 --> 01:28.129
Hey, Jack.

01:28.213 --> 01:32.717
So, what'll it be? The Roger Staubach
or the rookie Roger Staubach?

01:32.801 --> 01:35.970
Well, the Strickland Propane
Christmas card photo is coming up.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.807
And it's important that my customers
recognize me.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.893
So I think I'll just have the same haircut

01:41.893 --> 01:44.354
I've gotten every two weeks
for the past 20 years.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.899
Is that the Staubach
or the rookie Staubach?

01:47.899 --> 01:50.151
Uh, the Staubach.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.779
I can't do that. I don't have a stapler.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.451
I mean the buzz, buzz...
The thing you use...

01:58.535 --> 01:59.869
Takes off the hair.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.872
Uh, you know what, Jack?
I'll just take a rain check.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.915
No problem.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.917
Give my best to Marci.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.264
Well, how's it look, Hank?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.350
Uh, fine.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.643
Everything's fine.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.186
Hop on up, little bunny.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.814
That's okay. I just remembered

02:27.814 --> 02:30.942
I'm growing my hair out
to a modified Troy Aikman.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.903
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.030
- Come on, let's go, Bobby.
- Not so fast.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.574
You sat nice and still.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.617
Here you go.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.870
I'll, uh... save it for later, how 'bout?

02:41.870 --> 02:42.871
Start licking!

02:48.877 --> 02:51.796
Here's a picture of you
with normal hair mowing your lawn

02:51.880 --> 02:53.006
three months ago.

02:53.006 --> 02:57.468
And here is a download of you
at the post office minutes ago.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.471
See the guy in the beard
pointing and laughing at your head?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.556
That's me.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.517
Well, no one else is laughing.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.811
Hey, Hank. What'd you do to your hair?

03:06.895 --> 03:08.771
It's a nightmare, isn't it?

03:08.855 --> 03:09.981
Oh, my, yes.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.609
He feathered in the back
where he usually tapers.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.278
I find it unsubtle, but it's a way to go.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.530
Used to see it more... Claude Akins...

03:17.614 --> 03:19.824
Ross Martin, Robert Stack...

03:19.908 --> 03:22.160
James MacArthur
on the third season of "Five-O".

03:22.160 --> 03:24.495
That's not what I asked for at all.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.165
Of course, I am a trained Army barber.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.543
Ah, well, this was on a need-to-know basis

03:30.627 --> 03:33.588
but word is that Jack is losing it.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.634
Heard he was arrested for running naked
with a straight razor and a barber pole.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.928
Hank, I have been very respectful

03:39.928 --> 03:41.888
of your relationship
with Jack over the years

03:41.888 --> 03:43.890
but if you're ditching him,
give me a little time.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.726
I believe I can put together
over 20,000 references.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.269
I'm not leaving Jack.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.271
Jack's the only barber I've ever had.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.607
He saved me from my father's haircuts.

03:55.526 --> 03:58.071
Forty-five seconds... new record.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.948
I think you cut my ear.

03:59.948 --> 04:04.327
I think you cry more than that guy
I killed out from under that helmet.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.246
So Jack had a bad day.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.290
Maybe somebody smooth-talked him
out of his pension or something.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.752
Oh, well,
I guess that explains the feathering.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.379
Doesn't excuse it.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.675
- Have a seat, Hank.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.594
My 9:00, 10:00 and 11:00 canceled.

04:21.678 --> 04:26.099
Uh... Jack, this is tough to say.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.894
I'm not the kind of person
who would ask for any special treatment

04:29.978 --> 04:31.688
and I still consider you a friend,

04:31.688 --> 04:36.234
but I'm not completely satisfied
with my haircut.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.695
I'm going to have
to ask you for a free touch-up.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.113
You son of a bitch!

04:40.113 --> 04:43.157
- Slow down, Jack.
- You tipped me two dollars.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.410
That tip was a lie.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.537
I'm sorry, Hank.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.664
It's been a tough few weeks.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.292
I'm just lucky everyone
was wearing seat belts.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.876
Hop on up, pal.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.716
- Now take off your shirt.
- What?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.676
You're going back into work, aren't you?

05:01.676 --> 05:04.637
Lunchtime haircut,
you take off your shirt.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.488
Mm, mm-hmm.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.532
Yeah, got it.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.950
Wait right here.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
- <i>Madre de dios!</i>

05:38.421 --> 05:41.382
- You said it, honey.
- It's okay, everybody.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.385
It's me, Hank Hill, assistant manager.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.972
Continue with your business
as if everything were normal.

05:48.056 --> 05:52.101
I'll be working with my door closed
for obvious reasons.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.771
Hey, who's got their door closed?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.606
What's going on in there?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.232
Good god, Hank.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.485
You look like that fella
killed the other fella.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.863
Sir, I don't like to point fingers
but my barber is...

06:03.863 --> 06:07.658
Well, I did ask for a free touch-up,
but...

06:07.742 --> 06:09.452
No, no, he's out.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.162
I still can't pay you for today.

06:11.162 --> 06:15.041
Now take the afternoon off
and turn your hair back to a boy's color.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.757
Have a seat, Hank.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.426
I'll be with you as soon as I'm done
with this gentleman.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.387
Uh, Jack...

06:27.387 --> 06:30.807
Uh, I couldn't do this over the phone.

06:30.807 --> 06:35.311
Uh, Jack, we've had
a great 25 years, but...

06:35.395 --> 06:37.271
You don't have to say it, Hank.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.440
I'm getting out of the business.

06:39.524 --> 06:43.694
I can't stand dealing
with the jackasses anymore.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.197
You were one of the good ones, Hank.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.408
But your kid's a jackass.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.797
McMaynerberry has to have
a late-night barber shop.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.757
Arlen has one, Hank.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.342
And it's closer than you think.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.927
- Come on, let's go.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.430
Peggy, do you know anything
about dying hair?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.514
What's to know?

07:13.558 --> 07:16.769
Hello, Hank.
I heard about Jack. I'm sorry.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.356
- How did you hear about Jack?
- Well, it was on TV.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.358
You didn't see the high-speed chase?

07:23.609 --> 07:27.572
If there's anything I can help with
and it looks like there is...

07:27.572 --> 07:29.615
Hank, I've never cut civilian hair

07:29.699 --> 07:31.868
but I've been looking
at your head a long time.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.494
Don't do this, Bill.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.872
Trust me, it's not easy being my barber.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.081
I know that.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.667
You've got those big thick neck muscles

07:39.667 --> 07:43.254
that knot up when you're tense
leaving that deep, deep valley,

07:43.254 --> 07:47.049
and then the northern ridge runs
almost transverse to the crown.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.803
You worry too much about those
and you hit that scar over your left ear.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.097
Seems like there's a story there.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.475
You never shared it with me,
but that's okay.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.394
'Cause you might think I'm a gossip,
and I probably am,

07:58.478 --> 08:01.355
but how the hell would you know
if I'm a bad barber?

08:01.439 --> 08:04.650
- He's the same way with me.
- You're an amateur, Peggy.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.527
Jack was a legend, Hank,

08:06.611 --> 08:09.030
but when I come over
to my best friend's house

08:09.030 --> 08:10.781
and I see this...

08:10.865 --> 08:13.618
You're calling me an idiot!

08:13.618 --> 08:16.621
I want my old life back.

08:16.621 --> 08:20.541
Well, you tell me one got-dang thing
you know about cutting hair, Hank.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.126
Huh? What was that?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.003
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.465
Bill, how's it going to be in the alley
if you screw it up?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.592
I can do it, Hank.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.345
If you don't like it,
we'll never discuss it again.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.888
You owe me a chance.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.058
Uh... can you dye it back?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.851
There are 53 officers on that base

08:38.935 --> 08:40.895
who aren't wearing
their natural hair color.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.355
I dare you to pick 'em out.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.940
I need your earliest appointment.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.776
I got a 5:00 a.m. and a 5:30,
but I can squeeze you in at 6:00.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.694
- Okay, then.
- Okay, then.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.133
Uh, Bill.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.176
Hank.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.095
I heated some toaster pastries.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.098
There's an excellent article
about counterfeit truck parts...

09:17.098 --> 09:18.891
- Let's just do it.
- Mm-hmm.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.949
How's that?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.202
That's good.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.746
Well, that's... that's Jack good.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.500
That's the haircut I want
for the Strickland Propane Christmas card.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.668
You did it, buddy.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.546
Book me again in two weeks

09:48.546 --> 09:51.799
and every two weeks for the next 25 years.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.883
What do I owe you?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.720
No, no, Hank. This one's on me.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.471
If I could just keep the hair...

09:57.555 --> 10:00.850
No, no, this is a great haircut. I insist.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.395
Geez, Hank, I don't even think
I have a cash register.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.981
Hank Hill always pays his barber.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.983
Now are you my barber or not?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.651
I'll find a way to charge you, I promise.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.070
I'll fill out all the proper forms
and get the ball rolling.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.823
Great. And here's something for you.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.918
Ugh, another offer to subscribe
to the New Yorker.

10:28.002 --> 10:34.425
I... do not wish...
to subscribe to your publication.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.511
Hmm, something from the US Army.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.971
Hope I'm not drafted.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.605
Nine hundred dollars for a haircut?

10:47.605 --> 10:50.232
Damn it, Bill!

10:50.316 --> 10:53.653
And I'm sitting here cutting coupons.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.078
Ah, I wish this bill were a mistake,
Mr. Hill,

11:02.078 --> 11:04.997
but that is how much it costs the Army
to give someone a haircut.

11:05.623 --> 11:09.001
We pay 80,000 dollars
for each military-grade barber chair.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.587
The French make a chair
that costs 110,000.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.925
It's a damn good chair but I'm not going
to pay 110,000 dollars for a barber chair.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.136
Wasting all that money
is like buying a haircut

11:19.220 --> 11:22.890
for Saddam Hussein,
and I hate Saddam Hussein.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.850
I like his haircut, but that's it.

11:24.934 --> 11:28.562
Look, I know the chair's too much
at 80,000,

11:28.646 --> 11:32.066
but then they give us
a B-2 bomber for 1.3 billion.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.192
That's where we make it up.

11:35.611 --> 11:39.198
Well, you try getting
a B-2 bomber for 1.3 billion.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.116
You can't do it.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.538
It is a very nice haircut.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.915
Nine hundred dollars?

11:47.915 --> 11:51.502
I'm sorry, Hank.
I had no idea I was that valuable.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.505
So that's where the Army
makes all its money.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.426
Even Bill Clinton only spends
300 dollars on his haircuts

11:58.426 --> 12:01.429
and for that,
he gets the haircut plus a high colonic

12:01.429 --> 12:04.557
administered by Barbra Streisand.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.350
I guess I should've offered.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.729
If I was going to pay 900 dollars
for a haircut,

12:09.729 --> 12:12.189
it would have to be
an everlasting haircut.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.317
Hank, you can't fight the Army
without declaring war.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.695
Maybe if you had the Marines on your side.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.156
- They're better than us.
- Hank, there's something here.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.741
It-it's from the Army.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.993
Incoming!

12:23.993 --> 12:25.911
It's a collection letter.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.168
"We don't want to haunt you, but..."

12:32.168 --> 12:35.045
All right, they asked for it.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.840
I am going to write my congressman.

12:55.691 --> 13:00.404
"Representative Jim Powell
thinks your problem and flag-burning

13:00.488 --> 13:04.033
are among the biggest problems
facing America today.

13:04.033 --> 13:10.039
That's why Jim Powell has introduced
House Resolution 11461.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.958
It would ban flag-burning in all..."

13:13.042 --> 13:15.169
Ah, he never even read it.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.798
I'd go see him in person
but no self-respecting bus company

13:18.798 --> 13:20.925
would let me on with hair like this.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.264
Hey, Hank.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.266
I'm going to raise that money for you.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.728
Can you do better on the ice crusher?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.396
Nine hundred, firm.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.023
It only takes one.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.525
Don't do it, Dale.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.695
I'm not paying 900 dollars
for that haircut.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.323
If I was going to waste 900 dollars,

13:44.323 --> 13:47.993
I'd get something useful,
like a compound miter saw.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.746
I thought you said I did a good job.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.416
But what kind of fool
would pay 900 dollars for a haircut?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.253
Now, Bill, I could really use a trim.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.879
We could do it in my garage.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.048
No, I'm only allowed
to cut hair at the base.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.843
The US Army spent
three million dollars training me.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.011
Forget the Army.
It'll take you ten minutes.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.347
- I'll vacuum myself.
- Sorry, Hank.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.683
You got your principles, I got mine.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.436
- Half of a half of a percent.
- What?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.896
That's what you tipped me.

14:15.980 --> 14:20.860
Two dollars on a 900-dollar haircut
is less than half of a half of a percent.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.781
You don't need Bill.
Boomhauer and I love our girl.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.324
Yeah, man, I tell you what, man.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.076
Little old gal talking
a mile a minute, man.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.162
Like, slow down, man...

14:32.246 --> 14:35.624
No mousse, no gel, shower and go, man.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.127
With me, it's all about speed.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.379
I don't even have to take my hat off.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.841
So, that's where you get
your hair cut, huh?

14:44.466 --> 14:46.635
What's wrong with our hair?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.345
I didn't say anything.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.099
Well, she does pimp
that conditioner pretty hard.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.439
Oh, God, I need a hair net!

14:58.439 --> 15:00.441
Okay, look, Hank.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.569
Why don't you go ahead
and take my 1:00 with Ernst tomorrow.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.448
Do not be late unless you want
the coldest shampoo of your life.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.182
That's him! That's Hank Hill!

15:33.182 --> 15:34.558
I think.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.733
I've just been in touch
with Congressman Jim Powell's office.

15:42.733 --> 15:47.154
I'm here to present you with
a whistleblower's award of 3,900 dollars

15:47.154 --> 15:49.073
plus this point of light.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.157
For me?

15:50.157 --> 15:52.284
I didn't even know they kept that going.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.661
What's the money for?

15:53.661 --> 15:55.621
It's ten percent
of what you saved the Army

15:55.621 --> 15:57.373
by eliminating government waste.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.749
This way.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.795
I liked the old haircut better.

16:03.921 --> 16:08.092
Yeah, I hear they're wearing it short
in Guantanamo this summer.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.386
It's the Ricky Martin influence.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.972
Sir, would the captain like me

16:12.972 --> 16:14.807
to throw the lieutenant
out of the chair, sir?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.017
Sergeant, I have bad news.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.603
The base is disbanding the barber unit.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.772
They think we're inefficient.

16:21.772 --> 16:26.110
Petition to reinstate has been filed
but that could take 20 years.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.528
I'm sorry.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.279
Report for reassignment in the morning.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.034
Don't do it, son.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.245
I got no place else to go.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.133
Thirty-nine hundred dollars...

16:49.133 --> 16:51.552
We could get a new roof
just for the heck of it.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.807
You eliminated Bill.

16:56.807 --> 16:57.891
Bill-iminator!

16:57.975 --> 16:58.809
What?

16:58.809 --> 17:01.020
The Army shut down the sergeant barbers.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.897
Now Bill has no purpose
in the Army, either.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.190
Oh, no.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.483
Is Bill all right?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.819
I didn't ask. I came straight here

17:08.819 --> 17:12.072
so I could see your face
when you found out what you did.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.909
Is that real crystal?

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
Hey, look, you can make a prism.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.631
Maybe you want to take off
a little around the ears.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.469
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.055
Oh, don't worry about me, Hank.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.892
The Army made me a barber...
it's theirs to take away.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.518
Bill, you're an artist.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.853
You do things with hair

17:42.853 --> 17:45.647
that I've only seen other people do
with wood.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.983
Have you ever thought
of going out on your own?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.944
God, no. Then I'd just be a barber.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.572
I wouldn't be cutting hair for my country.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.743
No, I'll just punch the clock
till I'm ordered not to.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.873
Nine AM is overstating it, really.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.668
Most days, things don't get rolling
till, oh, say, 10:30.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.337
Hey, didn't I already give you a pen?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.714
Yeah, you already gave me a pen.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.174
What are you going to do about it?

18:12.966 --> 18:15.052
I can't leave my booth.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.308
I'm out of the Strickland Christmas card.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.477
Because of your hair?

18:23.477 --> 18:25.562
But Christmas is eight months away.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.524
Well, Mr. Strickland
wanted an elf in the picture

18:28.524 --> 18:31.610
and the Arlen midget spends
his winters in Florida.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.322
Damn it! Customers will think
I don't wish them a Merry Christmas.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.533
Hector wouldn't wear
the antlers five years ago

18:37.533 --> 18:39.660
and his sales have never recovered.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.996
Wow, you're taking this
even harder than poor Bill.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.748
You saw Bill?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.126
Mm-hmm. Over at the high school job fair.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.919
He was wiping eggs off his Jeep.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.089
Oh, wait, and Dale has something
he wants to tell you...

18:52.089 --> 18:56.468
Um, okay, they're auctioning off
Bill's old barber equipment today

18:56.552 --> 18:58.846
and he's absolutely heartbroken

18:58.846 --> 19:01.431
and, oh... and it's all your fault.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.058
Try and look surprised.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.278
That's the last time
I go off base for a haircut.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.241
Okay, who here knows how to cut hair?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.743
Don't answer, it's a trick!

19:30.127 --> 19:31.211
Here's the plan.

19:31.295 --> 19:35.674
We have to get as much
as we can for 3,900 dollars,

19:35.674 --> 19:39.428
less the 900 for the haircut
and the 10 percent auction fee.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.679
What's that come out to?

19:40.679 --> 19:43.807
Uh...

19:43.891 --> 19:45.184
Say it again.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.102
Oh, look over there.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.645
That's Cole Kitten,

19:48.729 --> 19:51.607
the kingpin of the Army surplus
auction world.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.027
First item, number 4801
Army barber chair, originally $80,000.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.862
I'm going to start the bidding
at two dollars.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.197
Three dollars.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.781
Four dollars.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.158
Hmm?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.120
Watch me take this guy out.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.706
Five dollars!

20:08.957 --> 20:10.542
Six dollars.

20:12.878 --> 20:17.799
Two thousand nine hundred
and ninety-nine dollars.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.052
Three thousand dollars.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.892
I'll be honest.
I get 20 dollars if I sign you up.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.645
I'll give you half of it.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.730
Dauterive. In. Now!

20:44.493 --> 20:45.619
Dauterive,

20:45.619 --> 20:48.580
your records have been doctored
to show you as a master electrician

20:48.664 --> 20:50.874
with a security clearance
for pinball repair,

20:50.958 --> 20:55.796
but your actual mission is to stand
at this privately-donated chair...

20:57.172 --> 20:59.424
which does not exist,
do you understand me?

20:59.508 --> 21:02.052
And do the only thing you're good at.

21:02.052 --> 21:05.222
But, sir, what... what if somebody sees?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.515
Don't ask, don't tell.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.725
That policy's got to work for something.

21:11.728 --> 21:15.857
Mm. I'm going to need
the combs and the jar.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.322
Hank,

21:22.406 --> 21:24.449
- I don't know how to...
- There's no time.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.618
The Strickland Christmas card shoot
is in an hour.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.161
But I haven't cut hair in a week.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.038
- Commence cutting!
- Yes, sir!

21:36.336 --> 21:38.046
All right, let's take this thing.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.173
Wait!

22:25.844 --> 22:28.430
<i>Oh god, I need a hair net!</i>
