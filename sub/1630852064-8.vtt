WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.128
DAKOTA: This is the last leg
of the trip.

00:03.211 --> 00:05.005
Something just doesn't feel right.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.549
We are going to two locations.

00:07.632 --> 00:11.636
You can actually
see his blood on the carpet.
I said, "Maybe I'll get rid of you."

00:11.720 --> 00:14.806
Number One's response was:
'You better bring God.'

00:16.391 --> 00:18.268
What? What? What?
Dude, the light's on.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.020
The (BLEEP) light is on!
What?

00:20.103 --> 00:22.647
Whatever we stirred up,
you guys are going to feel.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.859
Oh, my God!
It's totally Number One.
I want to get out of here.

00:25.942 --> 00:30.071
Whatever you stirred up,
we are going to feel. Something just
stepped into the attic.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.408
Did you hear that? (SQUEALS)
Oh, my God!

00:35.243 --> 00:37.287
My name is Dakota Laden.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.915
I'm leading my sister and two best
friends on a road trip,

00:40.999 --> 00:44.085
exploring the most haunted locations
in America.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.422
(SCREAMS) Oh, my gosh!
(WAILS)

00:49.674 --> 00:51.343
Go!

00:51.426 --> 00:54.346
Go, go, go, go!
I'm freaked out.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.097
Experimenting with fear

00:56.181 --> 00:59.434
and how it affects our interaction
with the paranormal.

00:59.517 --> 01:03.229
Each night we separate
and sleep alone.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.359
The catch is, only one of us
knows where we're going.

01:37.931 --> 01:41.184
This is the last leg of the trip.
We made it.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.521
Anybody even have any energy left?
cos I definitely don't.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.440
No, this is always the hardest part,
the end of the trip.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.151
We've been on the road
for over a month and a half

01:50.235 --> 01:52.362
and we've experienced a lot.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.949
But it's about to get very real.
We're just diving right into things.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.701
There is no time to spare.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.412
I have been planning
this night for years.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.248
Are you going to go through
everything that we have to?

02:03.331 --> 02:07.168
I will-- This is a team effort.
This is a team effort in a sense.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.504
What? I'm not going to give
you guys any hints

02:09.587 --> 02:11.297
only because right now

02:11.381 --> 02:15.218
we are pulling over to do
the packet lead right away.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.970
Wait. Right now?

02:17.053 --> 02:19.806
Right now. I'm upset with you.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.808
I'm upset I didn't do this earlier.

02:25.687 --> 02:30.608
We are going to two locations.
Wait, what? What?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.694
You can't do that, can you?
How?

02:32.777 --> 02:35.655
We've experienced a lot of different
types of fear before,

02:35.739 --> 02:37.741
but this location in this packet

02:37.824 --> 02:41.911
is all about the fear of feeling
safe when you're not.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.414
So, you guys want to open it up?

02:46.124 --> 02:49.127
You ready?
Let's do it.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.213
The Villisca Axe Murder House?
The Villisca Axe Murder House?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.595
Are you joking?
You guys know about Villisca?

02:58.678 --> 03:00.347
Yes. We can't go there.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.932
Yeah. We're going, dude.
This is about to get

03:03.016 --> 03:06.102
real dark real quick.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.064
ALEX: "Villisca,
a quintessential American town

03:09.147 --> 03:12.275
"that peeks out
from the vast Iowa corn fields,

03:12.359 --> 03:14.944
"a place where everyone knows
everyone

03:15.028 --> 03:17.697
"and most residents believe
you can sleep soundly

03:17.781 --> 03:20.158
"while leaving your doors
unlocked at night.

03:20.241 --> 03:24.162
"But in 1912, this quiet town
was changed forever.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.664
"Now associated
with graphic violence

03:26.748 --> 03:28.750
"and heart-breaking tragedy,

03:28.833 --> 03:32.170
"the Villisca Axe Murder House."

03:32.253 --> 03:36.966
This was a story that literally
took the sinking of the Titanic

03:37.050 --> 03:42.722
off of the front pages
of the newspapers nationwide.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.849
"On the morning of June 10th,

03:44.933 --> 03:48.937
Villisca resident Mary Peckham
was hanging her laundry outside

03:49.020 --> 03:51.690
"when she noticed her
next door neighbours, the Moores,

03:51.773 --> 03:53.483
"had not yet stirred.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.736
"Concerned, she called
her neighbour's brother Ross

03:56.820 --> 03:58.488
"to come over and check on them.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.241
"But when they turned the key
and let themselves in,

04:01.324 --> 04:04.035
"they were greeted
by a gruesome scene."

04:04.119 --> 04:07.706
Late that night somebody broke
into the home of the Moore family

04:07.789 --> 04:10.208
and killed every single
one of them.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.088
"As they made their way
to the downstairs bedroom,

04:15.171 --> 04:17.799
"they discovered the bodies
of two neighbour girls,

04:17.882 --> 04:21.428
"Ina, age eight;
and Lena Stillinger, age 12,

04:21.511 --> 04:24.389
"who had been invited
to the Moore's home for a sleepover.

04:24.472 --> 04:28.727
"They were still in bed, each one
bloody covered by a sheet."

04:30.770 --> 04:33.773
The authorities are called down,
they go up, six more bodies,

04:33.857 --> 04:37.318
they have eight total, six kids,
sadly, two adults.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.863
It was found that the heads
of the Moore family

04:39.946 --> 04:42.949
had all been beaten in with an axe.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.411
The flat head had been used
for the majority of the murders,

04:46.494 --> 04:48.580
crushing the skulls of everyone.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.957
And they were
all completely vulnerable,

04:51.041 --> 04:53.710
fast asleep in their beds.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.171
That is seriously
one of the darkest,

04:56.254 --> 04:58.298
most brutal deaths
we've ever heard of.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.217
The big theory is the killer
made his way into the house,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.596
just sat in that attic for hours
just waiting for them to come home,

05:04.679 --> 05:06.473
then he waited for them
to go to bed.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.851
The patience that this would
have taken, it's terrifying.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.854
That's the part of the story
that has always freaked me out

05:12.937 --> 05:15.523
is the fact that someone
could be in your house

05:15.607 --> 05:17.275
and you don't even know about it.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.027
Like, I still check bedrooms

05:19.110 --> 05:22.030
and different doors all the time
because of this story.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.032
"Though several people
were accused,

05:24.115 --> 05:27.827
"only one man was ever actually
tried for the murders.'

05:27.911 --> 05:30.038
Reverend Kelly
was an odd character,

05:30.121 --> 05:33.124
five-foot-two, 120 pounds,
travelling minister.

05:33.208 --> 05:36.211
We later now know
that he was schizophrenic.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.713
In his confession,
he said he went for a walk,

05:38.797 --> 05:40.465
ended up across the street

05:40.548 --> 05:42.884
where he said a shadow came out
of the backyard,

05:42.967 --> 05:46.179
handed him the axe, and he said
he walked in the front door,

05:46.262 --> 05:50.684
voices in the house told him
to slay utterly,
said he killed everyone.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.269
So they tried him
for the death of Lena, hung jury.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.522
Tried him for the death Ina,
full acquittal.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.191
In the eyes of the law,
this guy didn't do a thing.

05:58.274 --> 06:02.779
"Over a century later, the mystery
of who committed one of the most
vicious murders

06:02.862 --> 06:06.074
"in American history
still remains unsolved."

06:06.157 --> 06:08.660
"And while it is believed
that the eight victims

06:08.743 --> 06:11.037
"no longer linger within the walls,

06:11.121 --> 06:15.208
"there is definitely an overwhelming
dark force still there

06:15.291 --> 06:17.377
"that enacts violence and chaos

06:17.460 --> 06:20.422
"on those who dare to walk
through the front door."

06:22.132 --> 06:25.552
Do not take this location lightly.
It is not something to mess with.

06:25.635 --> 06:29.431
It is evil,
it is dark and it is unforgiving.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.350
See, that's the thing I've always
believed about this house

06:32.434 --> 06:35.145
is that it's just the killer
in there. Mm hm.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.648
And if it's not the killer,
it's something evil and demonic

06:38.732 --> 06:43.069
because when you have a super
tragic, violent murder like this,

06:43.153 --> 06:45.113
that opens up a lot of doors.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.745
"Lately, it seems that
the hauntings at Villisca

06:51.828 --> 06:54.998
"stretch far beyond the four walls
of the home.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.044
"Recent paranormal experiences
at a nearby abandoned location

06:59.127 --> 07:02.756
"have launched suspicions that
a never-before-explored connection

07:02.839 --> 07:07.093
"exists between them that might just
provide long sought-after answers

07:07.177 --> 07:09.888
"as to who committed
the axe murders."

07:09.971 --> 07:11.973
Wait, what?

07:12.057 --> 07:16.853
Yes, that brings me
to the next location.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.855
Chelsea, open it up.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.527
Malvern Manor?
Malvern Manor?

07:24.611 --> 07:26.279
What?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.951
"Located just 40 minutes away

07:32.035 --> 07:35.580
"from Villisca near the border
of Iowa and Nebraska

07:35.663 --> 07:41.670
"lies the remains of the formerly
extravagant Malvern Manor.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.464
"Originally known
as the Cottage Hotel,

07:44.547 --> 07:50.011
"the two-floor, 28-room facility
was the place to stay

07:50.095 --> 07:54.182
"for travellers coming
in and out of town by train.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.309
"Built in the 1870s,

07:56.393 --> 07:59.688
"the manor changed hands several
times over the decades

07:59.771 --> 08:02.816
"converting from a hotel
to a group home,

08:02.899 --> 08:06.027
"and then finally
to a nursing facility."

08:06.111 --> 08:08.196
You had a very vulnerable
population here.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.408
You had senior citizens, but then
also had people with a history

08:11.491 --> 08:13.159
of violent criminal behaviour.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.246
For a lot of people this was your
last stop before the streets.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.456
And so, you had this
mixture of residents,

08:18.540 --> 08:20.667
some who were nice, some less so.

08:20.750 --> 08:25.463
It is feasible to think that
whoever did the murders in Villisca

08:25.547 --> 08:30.218
would have stayed here a night
or two before or after.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.971
"One hundred and eighty seven
people passed away

08:33.054 --> 08:35.140
"within the halls of the building."

08:35.223 --> 08:38.601
"Even though no one has lived there
for over 15 years,

08:38.685 --> 08:41.521
"paranormal activity has started
ramping up recently."

08:43.273 --> 08:47.110
"The most active areas
include the Shadow Man Hallway.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.862
"Found on the first floor,

08:48.945 --> 08:52.240
"this area is aptly named
for the tall dark shadows

08:52.323 --> 08:54.659
"that charge towards you."

08:54.743 --> 08:56.911
"Entity Number One.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.872
"Seen throughout the facility,

08:58.955 --> 09:04.544
"Number One is a very aggressive
spirit with an alpha personality."

09:04.627 --> 09:08.048
The activity flatlines
and then here he comes.

09:09.799 --> 09:14.387
When addressing you, Number One
will say very specific things

09:14.471 --> 09:18.266
like, "I'm Satan himself.
I'm going to fucking kill you."

09:18.350 --> 09:21.144
He will try to get into your head.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.439
One time in particular, I said,
"Maybe I'll get rid of you."

09:24.522 --> 09:29.152
Number One's response was,
"You better bring God."

09:29.235 --> 09:31.738
Holy crap, dude. It's freaky.

09:31.821 --> 09:35.784
Both locations have this
overwhelming dark presence.

09:35.867 --> 09:39.120
It's been theorised that
the Villisca axe murderer
was not a local,

09:39.204 --> 09:42.290
that this was essentially
a hobo that was riding the rails

09:42.374 --> 09:44.751
committing murders
wherever he got off the train.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.879
It's even feasible to think
that the Villisca axe murders

09:47.962 --> 09:51.091
could have been plotted
within these walls.

09:51.174 --> 09:54.844
I think there's almost
the equivalent of a psychic railroad

09:54.928 --> 09:58.473
running between these two locations
that these entities have the ability

09:58.556 --> 10:00.850
to travel back and forth
between those places.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.977
We've all grown up knowing
about Villisca.

10:03.061 --> 10:07.148
I never knew anything about Malvern.
This is a whole different beast.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.983
We might as well ask questions

10:09.067 --> 10:11.277
to see if we can get some sort
of a response

10:11.361 --> 10:14.447
because people today are getting
responses at Malvern

10:14.531 --> 10:16.324
that tie to Villisca.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.084
Do you feel like you are ready
to take on these two locations?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.420
We can sometimes barely tackle
one location.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.463
I don't know
how we're going to do this.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.091
So me and Chelsea,
we're going to start at Villisca.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.052
Alex, Tanner, you guys are going
to start at Malvern Manor.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.680
Around 1:00 am
we're going to switch.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.391
I want to see
if we have similar experiences.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.061
I want to see if maybe something
that me and Chelsea do at Villisca

10:45.145 --> 10:47.439
affects your guys' experience
at Malvern.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.524
These places are supposed
to be connected.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.693
And if they weren't connected
before,

10:51.776 --> 10:54.362
I hope we don't form
some kind of connection

10:54.446 --> 10:58.908
on what we're doing, Dakota.
This sounds dangerous.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.119
All right.
Check it out, these are our SUVs.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.954
We're going to get all of our gear,

11:03.038 --> 11:05.123
split it up
and then from there we depart.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.710
We don't talk to each other
until about 1:00 am
when we make the switch.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.004
All right. Bye, guys.
All right. Good luck.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.177
Man, it is so weird not being
with Dakota and Chelsea.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.805
I know. Me and you do not balance
each other well.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.891
When you get scared,
I get extra scared.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.934
When I get scared,
you get extra scared.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.812
I just hope
we don't run into Number One.

11:27.896 --> 11:31.816
That is literally the one thing
I'm very scared about.

11:31.900 --> 11:36.613
(EXHALES) Well, we're getting close,
Chels. We are getting close.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.617
That is a creepy building.
That is so much creepier in person.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.203
Wait a sec, that's it right there.

11:43.286 --> 11:47.707
Holy crap, that's Villisca.
So small.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.377
Well, it's time to take
on Malvern Manor.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.130
I don't want to go in.
Here goes nothing, dude.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.882
We're here.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.511
This is like the first time
I'm actually like speechless.

11:59.594 --> 12:03.223
I do not want to go inside.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.770
Chelsea and I, we just got
to the Villisca Axe Murder House.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.647
You know,
this place might not be big

12:10.730 --> 12:14.526
but every square foot of this
place has major significance.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.153
There is such a different
feeling here.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.615
I am going to have the Ovilus
on the entire time.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.160
The Ovilus is a device that has
a word database inside of it.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.913
It's said that spirits
can manipulate the frequencies

12:26.996 --> 12:28.998
and choose whatever word they want.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.628
All right, this is the living room.

12:39.884 --> 12:44.264
So sad, that's the family.
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.981
They looked,
they had the cutest, sweetest kids.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.066
It's another picture.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.318
You know, it's like
so many people's dream

12:57.402 --> 13:00.155
to have a family, get a house.

13:00.238 --> 13:04.200
This family was at such
an exciting part in their life.

13:06.953 --> 13:11.416
If you hear my voice, can you come
and use this device in my hand

13:11.499 --> 13:14.002
to talk to us to give us a message?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.269
If there's somebody here with us...

13:33.104 --> 13:36.024
..can you come over here,
come down here?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.076
Who is here?
What is the dark negative energy

13:46.159 --> 13:49.412
that so many people feel here today?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.414
Is the killer still here?

13:52.582 --> 13:54.501
(INDISTINCT VOICE OVER DEVICE)

13:54.584 --> 13:56.461
Reverend. It just said reverend.
What?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.296
It said reverend. What?

13:58.380 --> 14:01.466
Like Reverend George Kelly?
Yes.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.844
That is like, what I was asking,
who's here, is it the killer?

14:04.928 --> 14:07.180
It's the Reverend.
(SIGHS)

14:07.263 --> 14:09.849
Like we've never gotten reverend
on the Ovilus once.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.310
I thought the Reverend
didn't do it.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.397
Obviously, we don't know
if it really was the Reverend.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.192
That's a really intelligent
response to get though.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.112
Like some things
are not coincidence.

14:22.195 --> 14:26.741
What made you want to kill
the entire Moore family

14:26.825 --> 14:29.244
and Ina and Lena who were visiting?

14:39.337 --> 14:42.257
All right, let's just keep exploring

14:42.340 --> 14:45.176
and I'm just going to keep
the Ovilus on the whole night.

14:51.683 --> 14:55.770
Alex and I have just walked
into Malvern Manor.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.148
(WHISPERS) Of all places
to start looking,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.692
we venture into the Shadow Hallway.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.905
Oh, my gosh, dude.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.491
I have a really bad feeling
about this hallway.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.702
I don't think
we should be down here.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.207
What's in here?

15:16.291 --> 15:19.461
Oh, it's like an old hospital room.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.463
This is where patients
probably were.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.381
God.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.258
I mean, this is one of the rooms

15:25.342 --> 15:28.595
that people see shadow figures
darting out of.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.681
Should we do
an Ovilus session here?

15:31.765 --> 15:34.017
All right.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.647
Is there anybody here with us?

15:39.731 --> 15:45.236
Tanner has a device in his hand
that will allow you to talk to us.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.906
Were you mistreated here
as a patient?

15:51.409 --> 15:53.161
I mean,
this being the nursing home,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.497
this would be
where most of the people died.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.624
Like, this is the nursing home,

15:57.707 --> 16:02.379
yet people are seeing dark entities
darting through the hallways.

16:02.462 --> 16:07.217
The entity known as Number One is
said to be all over this building.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.178
It has no restrictions,
it's everywhere.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.431
Are you good or are you evil?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.860
We're not really getting anything
on the Ovilus.

16:25.944 --> 16:29.197
Should we just keep moving?
I just don't feel like we're alone.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.200
I don't think we've been alone
this whole entire time.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.331
Let's check down this way.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.006
It's like harder to breathe
on this floor.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.140
Oh, my gosh, look at this room.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.392
Oh, my God.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.352
Is there anyone here with us?

17:06.192 --> 17:12.073
Can you make a noise,
let your presence be known?

17:12.157 --> 17:14.701
I just don't like this
at all, dude.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.290
Let's keep moving.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.209
What? What? What? What?
Dude, the light's on.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.045
The fucking light is on, dude.
What?

17:25.128 --> 17:27.714
The fucking light that we were
just in, that is on.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.841
Dude, how is that on?

17:29.924 --> 17:32.010
That's literally the room
we were just in.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.762
Hello?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.558
Is there someone down there?

17:40.226 --> 17:42.729
Holy shit, dude, what?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.276
I'm shutting it off.
What the hell, dude.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.404
Where is...

17:51.488 --> 17:54.199
It doesn't even like...

17:54.282 --> 17:56.368
How was it on then?

18:00.038 --> 18:03.500
Holy shit. You have to pull that.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.670
Are you kidding me right now?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.464
What?
Something pulled that string, Alex.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.383
Benefit of the doubt,

18:11.466 --> 18:14.344
this place is known to have weird
electrical problems.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.805
Like, I don't know
if that's paranormal,

18:16.888 --> 18:19.432
but that's so freaking weird
to me

18:19.516 --> 18:21.893
that we're asking questions in here,

18:21.976 --> 18:24.354
you're sitting right underneath
this light,

18:24.437 --> 18:27.065
we walk out
and then all of a sudden it's on.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.776
I don't understand that. Dude.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.988
Is there someone here?

18:37.492 --> 18:39.577
Did someone turn this light on?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.419
Let's just set the camera back up.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.130
I have the REM Pod,
and put it in here,

18:50.213 --> 18:53.341
and we'll just leave this area
for a while and...

18:53.425 --> 18:56.678
And just put surveillance
on this room.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.513
So right here is the REM Pod.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.099
It picks up electromagnetic
frequencies.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.059
(REM POD BEEPS)

19:03.143 --> 19:08.023
If anything gets close to that,
(BEEPS) it's going to go off.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.112
All right, let's leave that camera
for the rest of the night

19:14.195 --> 19:16.156
and let's just keep on exploring.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.742
This place is messing with us now.

19:20.744 --> 19:25.707
Let's do it, let's go upstairs.
This is so freaky, Dakota.

19:40.638 --> 19:46.019
Oh, my gosh.
So sad.

19:46.102 --> 19:52.817
Oh, these were the kids.
Oh, they're so cute.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.487
It's actually so sad
seeing their faces.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.114
It actually really upsets me.

19:58.198 --> 20:02.494
To be able to kill a child,
six children,

20:02.577 --> 20:07.248
I cannot even make my mind
go there.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.418
Sad thing is like
when you're a kid,

20:10.502 --> 20:13.880
you don't know the evils
of the world.

20:13.963 --> 20:18.468
You don't know that there
are sick people out there.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.804
Just imagine your childhood.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.099
It is, it is almost magical
being a child

20:24.182 --> 20:27.018
because you are so protected.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.897
These kids in this room
probably felt so safe.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.817
The parents' room is just ten feet
from here.

20:33.900 --> 20:39.072
Once the killer started his rampage,
this no longer was a safe spot,

20:39.155 --> 20:42.075
this was actually the spot
that made them trapped.

20:42.158 --> 20:46.371
They're probably so helpless.
Oh, my gosh.

20:54.546 --> 20:59.342
(OBJECT THUDS) What was that?
That was pretty loud.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.262
Yeah, that was...
It wasn't from outside either.

21:06.141 --> 21:09.060
That definitely didn't come
from outside, right? No.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.148
I feel like that came
from like, right below us.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.819
(GASPS)

21:17.902 --> 21:20.488
Did you hear that?
(CAT MEOWS) Oh, my God.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.741
It's a cat!
How did a cat get in here?

21:22.824 --> 21:25.869
What the... there's not supposed
to be a cat in here, Chelsea.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.996
(LAUGHS)

21:28.079 --> 21:32.375
Whoa. Hey, I don't know who you are.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.045
Whose cat is that?
I don't know.

21:35.128 --> 21:40.258
Wait, Dakota, is this a real cat?
It feels real.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.762
We need to go now.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.598
OK, is this like an angelic cat?

21:46.681 --> 21:49.392
It almost is like comforting,
it wanted to come up here

21:49.476 --> 21:51.811
and, like, we were really sad
for a minute.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.647
It's like we needed this.
I know.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.359
(DAKOTA AND CHELSEA GROAN SOFTLY)

21:57.442 --> 22:02.030
Honestly, best timing ever for
a cat to sneak into this building.

22:02.113 --> 22:06.326
I'm going to take you back outside.
Bye.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.078
Tanner and I have been

22:08.161 --> 22:12.749
walking around Malvern Manor
for a while now.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.544
We have been feeling like
we've been watched the entire time.

22:17.671 --> 22:21.174
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
This is not good, man.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.552
Number One has just been
hiding around corners,

22:24.636 --> 22:27.681
watching our every move.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.016
We still have to keep
exploring this place.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.560
We still have
a little bit to cover.

22:37.607 --> 22:41.319
What is the connection
between the Malvern Manor

22:41.403 --> 22:44.072
and the Villisca Axe Murder House?

22:49.119 --> 22:52.038
Did the killer
at the Villisca Axe Murder House

22:52.122 --> 22:54.082
stay in this building?

23:01.923 --> 23:04.050
I honestly have this horrible
feeling

23:04.134 --> 23:07.095
like something is standing
at the bottom of the stairs.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.681
Just waiting for us.

23:27.240 --> 23:31.578
(BEEPING)

23:31.661 --> 23:34.122
(OBJECT TAPPING, FOOTSTEPS TAPPING)

23:37.042 --> 23:40.378
So right now me and Chelsea
are going to go into the attic,

23:40.462 --> 23:43.089
which is right behind me here
on the second floor.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.927
People have used digital recorder
in the attic

23:48.011 --> 23:50.138
and they've gotten
children laughing.

23:55.727 --> 24:00.273
Oh, my gosh, there's some nails...
Yeah, there are.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.865
I'm going to roll on
the digital recorder.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.535
This is a device that picks up
frequencies that our ears
cannot hear

24:12.619 --> 24:15.163
and it's believed to pick up
spirit voices.

24:15.246 --> 24:19.709
I'm going to set it on the ground
between us so I don't touch it.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.380
Is it true
that the killer is still here,

24:23.463 --> 24:25.882
the person who murdered this family?

24:29.928 --> 24:33.431
Were you hiding in here?
Were you hiding in this attic?

24:36.976 --> 24:40.522
What is the killer's name?
Can you tell us your name?

24:44.025 --> 24:45.735
Did you come from out of town?

24:45.819 --> 24:49.239
Did you stay at the Malvern Manor,
the Malvern Hotel?

24:54.911 --> 24:59.290
All right, I am going to cut
on the digital recorder.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.668
Now we are going to play
this whole thing back.

25:01.751 --> 25:05.714
(DAKOTA SPEAKING ON TAPE)
Were you hiding in here?
Were you hiding in this attic?

25:10.093 --> 25:12.637
Did you come from out of town?

25:12.721 --> 25:16.808
Did you stay at the Malvern Manor,
the Malvern Hotel?

25:16.891 --> 25:18.852
(INDISTINCT VOICE ON DEVICE)

25:21.146 --> 25:23.481
(GARBLED VOICE ON TAPE)

25:23.565 --> 25:25.233
What? What was that?

25:25.316 --> 25:28.319
I don't know.
That was the last question, Chels.

25:28.403 --> 25:31.573
The response was louder
than your voice.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.034
Yeah.
And it wasn't like we were moving.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.952
Let me, let me play that again.

25:36.036 --> 25:39.456
(DAKOTA ON TAPE)
Did you stay at the Malvern Manor,
the Malvern Hotel?

25:39.539 --> 25:42.000
(INDISTINCT VOICE ON DEVICE)

25:43.918 --> 25:45.920
(GARBLED VOICE ON TAPE)
What?

25:46.004 --> 25:49.924
I have no idea what that said.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.761
It's definitely three syllables,
though, right away.

25:52.844 --> 25:56.806
And it is weird that it, it only
spoke when I talked about Malvern.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.934
I need to hear it again.
OK. I need to hear it
one last time.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.604
(DAKOTA ON TAPE)
Malvern Manor, the Malvern Hotel?

26:02.687 --> 26:05.607
(INDISTINCT VOICE ON DEVICE)

26:09.486 --> 26:12.655
Oh. That's so frustrating.
Damn.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.658
It's hard, I definitely
don't want to misinterpret this one

26:15.742 --> 26:17.869
because this
is such a sensitive topic.

26:17.952 --> 26:22.165
And it is a total theory that
Malvern and Villisca are connected.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.084
And I feel out of place

26:24.167 --> 26:27.253
to interpret something
that inaudible.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.005
Hopefully, someone out there

26:29.089 --> 26:30.965
who's watching
and listening to this,

26:31.049 --> 26:33.760
maybe they have a better idea
of what that's saying.

26:33.843 --> 26:39.599
It was said with a lot
of anger and emotion.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.351
(SIGHS)

26:43.269 --> 26:48.024
I feel so bad for Tanner and Alex.

26:48.108 --> 26:51.945
This entire house
is starting to wake up.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.531
And Tanner and Alex are walking
into this place next,

26:54.614 --> 26:58.284
I don't think they're ready
for it because it's definitely,
It's waking up.

26:58.368 --> 27:02.247
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, let's get out of here.

27:02.330 --> 27:06.835
We'll go downstairs,
start packing up our stuff.

27:06.918 --> 27:09.087
Let's call Tanner and Alex.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.839
Hello.
Hey, what's up, dude?

27:10.922 --> 27:14.300
How, how's it going over there?
Oh, it's going, man.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.803
Honestly, me and Alex both feel

27:16.886 --> 27:19.931
like we've been followed
this entire night.

27:20.015 --> 27:23.476
Oh, my gosh. Well,
here maybe we wrap up right now,

27:23.560 --> 27:25.228
it's almost one o'clock.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.943
You guys want to meet
somewhere in the middle
of the two locations

27:32.027 --> 27:34.195
so we can like see
each other and talk quick?

27:34.279 --> 27:36.156
Perfect. We'll see you soon.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.076
Hello.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.496
Dude, you are not going to believe
what happened to us.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.874
What happened?
We went into one of the rooms

27:45.957 --> 27:49.461
and we were doing
an Ovilus session, and we went
back into the hallway,

27:49.544 --> 27:53.423
the room we were just in,
there was a freaking light on.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.717
Like, it wasn't on before?
No. No.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.095
Dude, we were like flipping
the light switch,
nothing was happening,

27:59.179 --> 28:02.932
and we realised it's a freaking
pull thing on the light.

28:03.016 --> 28:05.810
What the hell, it's a pull switch?
Yeah.

28:05.894 --> 28:08.605
It was a pull switch.
So something had to actually

28:08.688 --> 28:10.815
like physically pull
that string down.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.068
Oh, my gosh.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.696
Villisca definitely is active.

28:16.780 --> 28:20.367
And we got "Reverend" on the Ovilus.
What?

28:20.450 --> 28:23.244
Yeah.
Reverend, like Reverend George Kelly

28:23.328 --> 28:27.290
who, the only person that was
put to trial for the murder.

28:27.374 --> 28:31.670
That's actually unbelievable
that that came through.

28:31.753 --> 28:35.173
There were so many moments where we
both just almost were like in tears.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.175
It was just so sad, so heavy.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.886
You will feel it
the second you walk in.

28:39.969 --> 28:43.973
That's what I'm nervous about.
Whatever we stirred up,
you guys are going to feel.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.476
Whatever you guys stirred up,
we're going to feel.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.770
When we were leaving,
it was getting started.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.147
All I can say is just good luck
and be careful.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.982
Good luck, guys.

28:58.363 --> 29:02.992
Oh, my God.

29:05.245 --> 29:09.040
We just got
to the Villisca Axe Murder House.
We have set up our gear room

29:09.124 --> 29:12.502
and now we are just going to start
exploring this entire house.

29:12.585 --> 29:16.006
During our walkthrough,
I'm going to have the Ovilus
on the entire time

29:16.089 --> 29:18.508
and hopefully we'll get a response.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.760
Let's start making
our way upstairs.

29:23.638 --> 29:26.307
Oh, my God.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.476
This is the bed
where the parents stayed.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.146
Oh, my God. Look,
look at that wall.

29:31.229 --> 29:34.357
What? No way.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.735
That dent right there,
that is from the axe,

29:36.818 --> 29:39.320
from it being violently pulled back

29:39.404 --> 29:43.033
and struck back down
on both the parents.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.871
My heart, like, hurts right now.

29:47.954 --> 29:52.208
I mean, I definitely don't feel
alone, that's for sure.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.169
Let's keep on walking.

29:57.005 --> 29:58.965
No way.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.801
This is the children's room.

30:01.885 --> 30:05.347
Their pictures are on the wall.
Oh, my God.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.474
Four little kids
lost their lives here.

30:07.557 --> 30:10.977
Oh, my God, look, right there.
No way.

30:11.061 --> 30:13.730
There's more axe marks.
Mm-hm.

30:13.813 --> 30:17.484
It's all just a story until
you actually step foot in this house

30:17.567 --> 30:21.196
and see the axe marks
in the ceiling and the walls.

30:21.279 --> 30:24.616
Puts everything into perspective.

30:24.699 --> 30:28.953
Every step we take in this house
just doesn't feel right.

30:29.037 --> 30:30.747
No.

30:36.002 --> 30:39.756
Oh, my God.

30:39.839 --> 30:43.677
This room is so small.
I can barely fit through the door.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.809
So right here is the Quad.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.104
This will pick up
small amounts of vibration.

30:55.772 --> 30:58.441
So we're going to leave it
here and ask some questions

30:58.525 --> 31:00.485
and maybe get a response.
(DEVICE BEEPING)

31:00.568 --> 31:03.697
If there's anyone here with us,
we have a device on the ground,

31:03.780 --> 31:06.533
can you come close to it,
let us know that you're here?

31:07.826 --> 31:10.495
Can you make a noise,
make this device go off?

31:10.578 --> 31:12.247
Walk towards us.

31:14.082 --> 31:17.961
If the killer is here, can you
give us a sign of your presence?

31:21.798 --> 31:23.883
I don't like it in here.
Something's off.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.594
Like my body is ice cold right now.

31:29.055 --> 31:32.308
I feel like something is standing
right in the bedroom right now.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.488
(DEVICE BEEPS)
Holy shit!

31:45.572 --> 31:47.407
That just went off!

31:47.490 --> 31:50.869
Can you make that go off again?
Just need to take one more step.

31:55.373 --> 31:58.001
Do you want us out of this room?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.503
Can you make a noise?
And we'll follow it.

32:02.922 --> 32:05.383
Can you make this device
go off again?

32:12.390 --> 32:14.100
We've been here
for a while now.

32:14.184 --> 32:17.395
What we're going to do is we're
going to leave that camera rolling

32:17.479 --> 32:21.399
just so if it does go off,
we will have it on tape.

32:21.483 --> 32:23.818
I think we should step
into the children's room

32:23.902 --> 32:25.779
and whip out the music box.

32:29.991 --> 32:34.954
We have been at the Malvern Manor
for a little over two hours now.

32:35.038 --> 32:38.708
This is creepy.
Fire extinguisher.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.877
Sorry. Just trying to get
a cool shot of you.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.004
Oh, my gosh.
So far nothing.

32:43.088 --> 32:45.757
We've asked questions
to entity Number One.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.718
If Number One is here,
can you make a noise?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.137
Can you move something?

32:51.221 --> 32:53.807
I have felt like we've been
constantly followed

32:53.890 --> 32:55.642
just like Tanner and Alex felt.

32:55.725 --> 32:59.145
Oh, my gosh, I got a really bad
feeling on this side of the hallway.

32:59.229 --> 33:02.774
I think the creepiest part
about Malvern is the design of it.

33:02.857 --> 33:07.153
So many turns, tight hallways,
creepy rooms.

33:07.237 --> 33:10.115
The whole thing is designed
in a very unique way

33:10.198 --> 33:12.283
that totally terrifies me.

33:16.079 --> 33:19.207
Seriously,
what the hell is this door?

33:19.290 --> 33:22.002
I don't even want to know.

33:27.382 --> 33:31.553
Creepy. Hell, no.

33:31.636 --> 33:37.017
What? Let me see.
Dude, hell, to the no. Hell, no.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.310
What? Yeah. No...

33:39.394 --> 33:42.355
What? ..fricking chance.

33:44.983 --> 33:49.362
Dude, what the actual--
I'm like, almost can't fit.

33:52.532 --> 33:56.786
Oh, jeez, something...
Screw that.

33:56.870 --> 34:00.040
So right now me and Chelsea,
we are in the attic.

34:00.123 --> 34:02.083
This is where people
have experienced

34:02.167 --> 34:04.794
tightness in their chest.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.297
This is definitely weird
being in this attic,

34:07.380 --> 34:09.758
especially coming from Villisca.

34:09.841 --> 34:13.136
Oh, my gosh.
This is terrifying.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.638
Where does that lead?
To like nowhere.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.807
There's nothing in it.

34:17.891 --> 34:21.436
I don't even think
anything was like stored in here.

34:21.519 --> 34:23.480
I think it's just an empty space.

34:26.191 --> 34:29.611
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Is somebody up here?

34:29.694 --> 34:32.864
Is Number One up here,
entity Number One?

34:32.947 --> 34:35.867
If there's someone up here,
can you move one of these objects?

34:35.950 --> 34:37.702
Can you knock on the wood?

34:37.786 --> 34:39.537
(KNOCK ON WOOD)
(GASPS)

34:39.621 --> 34:42.957
Why would I ask that? What the hell.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.251
That was right below us.
I know.

34:45.335 --> 34:48.338
There's still a camera
rolling down there.

34:48.421 --> 34:51.549
Can you move one of these objects?
Can you knock on the wood?

34:51.633 --> 34:53.551

(GASPS)

34:57.389 --> 34:59.891
(OBJECT CLATTERING)

34:59.974 --> 35:03.728
Let's just get out of the attic
and go back down on the first floor,

35:03.812 --> 35:05.605
Shadow Hallway.

35:11.027 --> 35:14.447
So right now me and Chelsea
are on the first floor.

35:14.531 --> 35:18.201
We just set up three REM Pods
down the Shadow Hallway.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.495
They're separated
by about ten feet each.

35:20.578 --> 35:23.248
If anything goes close
to any one of those REM Pods,

35:23.331 --> 35:26.167
we will know because it will beep.

35:26.251 --> 35:28.294
Is there somebody here with us?

35:28.378 --> 35:31.214
Can you stand next to one
of the red lights on the ground?

35:31.297 --> 35:33.299
Can you go touch
one of those red lights?

35:34.843 --> 35:37.220
Can you come out of whatever room
that you're in

35:37.303 --> 35:39.973
and touch one of those red lights
on the ground?

35:45.770 --> 35:47.439
Oh, my gosh.

35:47.522 --> 35:51.401
I don't like it in this room.
I don't either. Just feels wrong.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.994
OK, so this is the music box.
Has a motion sensor in the front.

36:01.077 --> 36:04.164
If anything walks in front of it,
(CHIMES) it's going to go off.

36:04.247 --> 36:07.000
I'm just going to set this down
on the ground right here

36:07.083 --> 36:09.294
and point it out the door.

36:12.797 --> 36:15.258
The device on the ground
makes a song,

36:15.342 --> 36:17.427
you just have to walk
in front of it.

36:19.346 --> 36:21.222
Who's ever in this house,

36:21.306 --> 36:23.767
please,
walk in front of this device,

36:23.850 --> 36:26.603
let us know that you're here.

36:26.686 --> 36:29.189
Are you scared that
we're in your house right now?

36:29.272 --> 36:31.316
Is that why you're not coming
in here?

36:37.614 --> 36:41.743
We mean you no harm. We're just
trying to figure out your story.

36:41.826 --> 36:44.371
Can you help us?

36:47.082 --> 36:49.250
Oh, dude, you hear the train?

36:49.334 --> 36:53.546
One of the theories is that
the killer travelled by that train

36:53.630 --> 36:56.091
that we're hearing right now.

against that at all.

this device go off.

38:40.153 --> 38:42.655
Can you do it again
while we're in this room?

38:44.407 --> 38:46.368

38:48.578 --> 38:50.538
We've been up here
for a long time now.

38:50.622 --> 38:53.750
Since we walked in this room,
it has not gone off.

38:53.833 --> 38:56.628
So I think we should
just keep on moving.

38:56.711 --> 38:59.214

who stayed at the hotel here

38:59.297 --> 39:01.091
and you passed away at the hotel,

39:01.174 --> 39:03.009
can you make
one of the lights go off?

39:03.093 --> 39:04.969
Can you touch
one of those red lights?

39:08.473 --> 39:12.727
It just feels like something's
definitely down that hall.

they see shadows

ten seconds later, boom.

can you do that one more time?

like by that room.

from this room...

that Tanner and Alex
had the light go off on them.

Hello. Hey, Alex,
me and Chelsea have a question.

40:46.488 --> 40:48.281
Yeah.
Do you guys remember

40:48.365 --> 40:52.369
what room it was that you guys
found the light on in?

on the right.

There's three REM Pods.

40:59.209 --> 41:02.045

is literally right outside

41:02.128 --> 41:04.047
that door you're describing.
What?

41:04.130 --> 41:07.550
Wait a sec.
Stay on the phone with me.
Stay on the phone with me. OK.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.844
I just want to make sure
it's the same room.

41:09.928 --> 41:12.430
Did the room have like a TV
on the ground? Yep.

41:12.514 --> 41:14.933
There's a couch
right in the middle of the room.

41:15.016 --> 41:17.435
There is a cou... Yeah,
that's the freaking room.

41:17.519 --> 41:20.480
That is the room.
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God.

41:20.563 --> 41:23.483
We, it only went off when
we asked questions to Number One.

41:23.566 --> 41:25.485
Dude, be careful.
Yeah, seriously. Yeah.

41:25.568 --> 41:28.446
We're not going
to mess around too much more
in this hallway

41:28.530 --> 41:31.408
because if it is Number One,
I don't want to mess with it.

41:31.491 --> 41:35.704
No, because whatever Number One is,
it's-it's not a human spirit.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.706
It's nothing good. OK.

41:37.789 --> 41:41.710
(SIGHS) OK, well, I will talk to you
guys in a little bit.

41:41.793 --> 41:44.921
All right, sounds good, man.
All right, see you guys.

41:45.005 --> 41:47.799
I want to get out of here.
It just scared me even more.

41:47.882 --> 41:49.718
What are the freaking
chances of that?

41:49.801 --> 41:52.387
We had a very similar experience
to them

41:52.470 --> 41:54.973
and they had a very similar
experience to us.

41:57.976 --> 42:00.812
That blows my mind.
I can't believe it, man.

42:00.895 --> 42:04.399
That makes me think that what
happened to us was paranormal.

42:04.482 --> 42:08.653
(FOOTSTEP THUDDING)

42:08.737 --> 42:12.407
Do you hear that?
That sounds like walking.

42:12.490 --> 42:14.200
What the hell!

42:16.494 --> 42:18.830
Hello?

42:18.913 --> 42:20.790
Who is here with us right now?

42:22.334 --> 42:24.919
It is said that there's
a dark energy in this house.

42:25.003 --> 42:27.881
What is that dark energy?

42:27.964 --> 42:31.509
Who's ever here, do you know
who the killer was?

42:31.593 --> 42:36.056
Can you give us a name,
anything, a description?
(INDISTINCT VOICE ON DEVICE)

42:36.139 --> 42:38.683
Dude! What?
It says Reverend.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.727
No, it doesn't.
It says Reverend, dude.

42:40.810 --> 42:42.979
Are you kidding me?
Like Reverend Kelly.

42:43.063 --> 42:46.191
Like, he admitted to killing them
and he got acquitted twice.

42:46.274 --> 42:48.526
Are you kidding me right now?

42:48.610 --> 42:51.029
That's what Chelsea
and Dakota said they got too.

42:51.112 --> 42:53.740
You're right. Is that confirmation?
I don't know.

42:53.823 --> 42:57.243
Like, it's not often you get
the same kind of response.

43:00.622 --> 43:02.624
Reverend, are you here right now?

43:04.292 --> 43:06.920
Are you the one that's stuck
in this house?

43:08.254 --> 43:12.467
Why did you murder all these
people? They did nothing wrong.

43:14.511 --> 43:17.472
Can you come into the living room
and talk to us?

43:20.850 --> 43:25.230
If the killer is still here,
I hope his soul never finds peace.

43:27.232 --> 43:29.109
The sun is coming up right now.

43:29.192 --> 43:32.362
I mean, we might as well
just pack up and get ready.

43:32.445 --> 43:35.031
I am definitely ready
to leave this place.

43:35.115 --> 43:37.033
(PHONE LINE TRILLING)

43:37.117 --> 43:40.453
Hello.
Yo, the RV is on the way

43:40.537 --> 43:42.247
to pick you guys up right now.

43:42.330 --> 43:45.208
I can't wait to hear all
about you guys' night.

43:45.291 --> 43:47.293
All right, man, sounds good.

43:52.048 --> 43:55.135
That might have been the most
difficult thing we've done yet,

43:55.218 --> 43:58.054
not because
it was physically draining

43:58.138 --> 44:00.056
but it was emotionally draining.

44:00.140 --> 44:01.891
Being separated from each other

44:01.975 --> 44:04.519
really made me value
the teamwork that we have.

44:04.602 --> 44:07.105
And I think it was
a great challenge for sure.

44:07.188 --> 44:10.984
Villisca may have been the smallest
place we've ever been,

44:11.067 --> 44:14.779
but the haunt and the energy,
it consumed you.

44:14.863 --> 44:19.409
I guarantee you, I will be checking
behind my curtains in my closets

44:19.492 --> 44:22.662
and under my bed every single day.

44:22.746 --> 44:25.040
The fact that Dakota and Chelsea

44:25.123 --> 44:28.418
and Alex and I both got "Reverend"
on the Ovilus,

44:28.501 --> 44:32.047
it points to that it could
have been Reverend Kelly
the whole entire time.

44:32.130 --> 44:34.215
But sometimes you have
to take a step back

44:34.299 --> 44:36.051
and look at the bigger picture.

44:36.134 --> 44:39.554
Was it really the Reverend?
Or was this dark evil energy

44:39.637 --> 44:42.557
that's still there trying
to trick us?

44:42.640 --> 44:46.811
As far as connection between
Malvern Manor and Villisca,

44:46.895 --> 44:51.483
I can't say for sure, but what I do
know is there is a negative energy

44:51.566 --> 44:53.443
at both of those locations.

44:53.526 --> 44:57.781
Both groups experienced very
similar things at each location.

44:57.864 --> 45:00.408
But I don't think
we were able to really make

45:00.492 --> 45:03.370
a significant connection
between the two locations.

45:03.453 --> 45:05.121
I do think that this is a theory

45:05.205 --> 45:07.832
that needs to continue to be
put to the test

45:07.916 --> 45:10.251
and it's not going to be solved
in one night.

45:12.462 --> 45:14.673
I feel the only way
that we can shake

45:14.756 --> 45:18.468
this last Malvern Manor
and Villisca House location

45:18.551 --> 45:21.304
is that we have to go bigger
and we have to go batter.

45:21.388 --> 45:24.432
I think our experiences
at Villisca and at Malvern,

45:24.516 --> 45:28.019
it really has opened up
a whole new door for us.

45:28.103 --> 45:32.649
So this is it,
this is the end of the road.

45:32.732 --> 45:34.567
Or is it?

45:34.651 --> 45:37.987
I can tell you right now
we are not done.
