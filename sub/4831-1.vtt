00:17.809 --> 00:23.397
Buck Rogers in the 20th century!

00:24.899 --> 00:28.777
Buck Rogers, now adventuring in the
amazing world of the 20th century.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.947
By turning the dial
to project us ahead in time…

00:32.115 --> 00:36.285
…we're able to be with Buck and friends
in the wonderful world of the future.

00:36.453 --> 00:40.289
A world that sees a lot of our scientific
and mechanical dreams come true.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.625
You know, there's nothing supernatural
or mystic about Buck.

00:43.793 --> 00:47.004
He's just an ordinary, normal human
being who keeps his wits about him.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.896
- What's wrong?
- Nothing really.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.107
I just feel that I need
something stronger.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.819
If you have a problem,
don't hesitate to ask for assistance.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.947
- Yes, thank you, I'll be all right.
- Call 348-FUN…

03:27.999 --> 03:29.791
What's wrong?

03:30.460 --> 03:31.627
Never mind.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.590
Never mind.

03:36.758 --> 03:41.970
Never mind.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.805
Never mind. Never mind.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.311
Can you feel this?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.647
What is that? Nausea?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.440
Are you now?

03:53.608 --> 03:55.943
Or have you ever been?

03:56.444 --> 03:58.445
Move slowly.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.178
Hello, is somebody else there?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.514
THX, this is inner control.

04:26.140 --> 04:31.353
You're off .017 to the right.
Correct it, please.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.856
Make the correction, THX.

04:35.483 --> 04:40.195
All right. Just back off,
THX 1138. Back off for a second.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.574
- Okay, hold it there, 1138.
- Hold. Hold. Hold…

04:45.076 --> 04:47.661
- What's wrong?
- I need something stronger.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.705
Take four red capsules.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.458
In 10 minutes, take two more.
Help is on the way.

04:54.585 --> 04:57.754
- What's wrong?
- Take a visual record of this.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.716
We found it in the patching cells.
We killed it.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.884
Thank you for being conscientious.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.262
A visual record is being taken…

05:05.471 --> 05:08.932
…and filed with the Department
of Biological Flow. You have…

05:09.267 --> 05:12.102
… now out of service
in one section of the Filoz era…

05:12.270 --> 05:16.064
… shall, in any consequence
of any law or regulation…

05:16.232 --> 05:18.191
…be discharged from such service…

05:18.359 --> 05:23.488
…but shall be delivered up on claim of
the party to whom such service may be due.

05:28.745 --> 05:33.415
For greater efficiency,
consumption is being standardized.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.875
We are sorry.

05:35.043 --> 05:39.421
All right, just back off,
THX 1138. Back off for a second.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.924
All right,
make the appropriate correction.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.052
That's it.

05:46.554 --> 05:52.434
Check the grid line.
Should be 1239, 1239.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.104
All right, watch it. You're gonna
override again. Bring it down.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.773
You're right next to it.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.441
- Right.
- What's wrong?

05:59.609 --> 06:03.945
I bought one of these yesterday
and it doesn't fit my consumer…

06:04.113 --> 06:06.573
…and the store doesn't have
the other kind.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.910
For more enjoyment
and greater efficiency…

06:10.078 --> 06:12.954
…consumption is being standardized.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.456
- We are sorry.
- This is…

06:14.791 --> 06:17.793
Attention all stations,
I have a temporary blockage…

06:17.960 --> 06:20.087
…affecting a Red Section module.

06:20.254 --> 06:23.298
Watch the insertion in the override.
It's getting into a critical phase.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.345
- What's wrong?
- Comperson and penderal…

06:28.554 --> 06:31.598
What's wrong, Papa?
- …compatible within group 3A.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.643
If you feel
you are not properly sedated…

06:34.811 --> 06:39.272
…call 348-844 immediately.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.483
Failure to do so may result…

06:41.651 --> 06:46.196
…in prosecution
for criminal drug evasion.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.156
A. Excursions…

06:48.324 --> 06:51.535
For more enjoyment
and greater efficiency…

06:51.702 --> 06:55.664
…consumption is being standardized.
We are sorry…

06:55.832 --> 06:57.666
This is city probe scanner.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.002
We've run across
some illegal sexual activity.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.880
It should be on your DTO screen now.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.524
There has been an accident
in Red Sector L14.

07:22.692 --> 07:27.737
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.

07:27.905 --> 07:32.868
Repeat, there has been
an accident in Red Sector L14.

07:33.035 --> 07:38.707
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.711
6241, is everything all right down there?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.717
That accident over in Red Sector L…

07:48.885 --> 07:51.386
…destroyed another 63 personnel…

07:51.554 --> 07:56.349
…giving them a total
of 242 lost to our 195.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.561
Keep up the good work
and prevent accidents.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.563
This shift is concluded.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.361
A libido leveler has been mislaid…

08:08.529 --> 08:10.572
…near the pulse-buffering gate.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.407
If you have accidentally…

08:20.041 --> 08:26.087
Today, blue
dendrites are only 47 credits. Buy now.

08:32.220 --> 08:36.722
Visual binaries now
can previse and improve your reading.

08:47.485 --> 08:52.906
Your consumer has a factor of 98.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.705
Stay calm.

09:17.139 --> 09:21.017
This elevator
has been removed from service.

09:21.227 --> 09:25.772
Please use the next elevator
on your right.

09:27.149 --> 09:31.111
This elevator has been removed
from service.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.321
Please use the next elevator…

09:37.493 --> 09:40.203
My time is yours.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.205
- Masses for the masses.
- Go ahead.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.292
One for all. All is one.
Masses are what we are.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.378
We are the masses.
But all in all, we are masses.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.172
For the Party and for all,
masses are what we are.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.676
Very good. Proceed.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.307
Well…

10:02.643 --> 10:04.311
…I slipped…

10:04.645 --> 10:07.355
…on a thermal transfer this morning.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.150
It's never happened before.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.573
I wasn't concentrating enough.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.534
Yes, I understand.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.370
Things haven't been…

10:23.289 --> 10:25.832
- …going well.
- Yes, fine.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.543
How could I be so wrong?

10:33.507 --> 10:35.216
My mate…

10:36.385 --> 10:39.012
…has been acting very strange.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.598
I can't explain it.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.226
- Yes.
- I haven't been feeling very well myself.

10:45.394 --> 10:49.230
- Yes, I understand.
- I don't know, maybe it's me.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.193
Yes, fine.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.237
I needed some pinural last night.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.117
- I feel as if something…
- Excellent.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.578
…odd were happening to me.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.373
- Something that…
- Yes?

11:06.957 --> 11:10.627
- …I can't understand.
- Could you be more…

11:10.836 --> 11:12.420
…specific?

11:12.588 --> 11:14.547
The sedatives.

11:15.424 --> 11:19.886
I'm taking etracene,
but it doesn't seem strong enough.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.430
I have a hard time concentrating.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.767
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.436
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.

11:28.604 --> 11:33.650
Thou art a subject of the divine,
created in the image of man…

11:33.859 --> 11:37.112
…by the masses, for the masses.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.409
Let us be thankful
we have an occupation to fill.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.577
Work hard.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.746
Increase production.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.083
Prevent accidents.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.960
And…

11:52.128 --> 11:54.129
…be happy.

11:54.922 --> 11:59.259
If it will make you happy,
just this once.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.803
Now, be careful, it's heavy.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.439
THX?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.504
THX?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.525
THX?

12:57.693 --> 12:59.486
Is that you?

13:20.174 --> 13:23.426
We are sorry,
but we must deny your request.

13:23.594 --> 13:29.098
Birthborns are not allowed
more than 5 units of enerval.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.393
Substitution of enerval for etracene…

13:34.730 --> 13:36.898
…may cause
a serious chemical imbalance.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.025
Thank you.

14:20.276 --> 14:23.736
Never before have we been
so contented. Never.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.992
A dragon sounds like this when…

15:19.835 --> 15:23.171
…Nine units of detuned escalatories
have not, however…

15:23.339 --> 15:27.300
…prevented virus and ordnance
from invading our centers.

15:28.177 --> 15:32.805
The three recently elected representatives
from Con 9 have again resigned…

15:32.973 --> 15:35.892
- …and returned to their sectors.
- You ought to eat.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.228
Five felons were caught fleeing
rehabilitation center DD2.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.398
All five have been undergoing treatment
for drug offenses.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.695
- Where did you get this car?
- I was just issued it.

15:47.863 --> 15:52.367
I took it for a test drive and ran straight
through a crowd at the dispersal center.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.329
Oh, terrible. Terrible.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.581
No. No, it was wonderful.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.042
Because I didn't hit anyone,
just an 1114.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.419
What's this? Why did you change it?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.047
- You've seen enough.
- That's wonderful.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.758
- It's terrible.
- You know I don't feel well.

16:09.176 --> 16:14.180
- Take your sedation.
- That is just terrible.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.183
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.770
Because my hand,
it was paralyzed anyway.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.189
That was very funny.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.405
An enerval overdose…

16:30.572 --> 16:33.574
…may cause
a serious chemical imbalance.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.801
My time is yours.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.220
Go ahead.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.764
What's wrong with me?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.935
What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing.

17:01.103 --> 17:05.272
- Yes, fine.
- She's an ordinary roommate.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.402
I share rooms with her.

17:09.569 --> 17:13.406
- Our relationship is normal, conforming.
- Excellent.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.407
We share nothing…

17:15.951 --> 17:17.910
…but space.

17:18.244 --> 17:20.454
What is she doing to me?

17:22.915 --> 17:25.251
Yes, I understand.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.502
I think I'm dying.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.923
Could you be more…

17:31.091 --> 17:32.842
…specific?

17:41.226 --> 17:43.978
You are a true believer.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.272
Blessings of the state.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.608
Blessings of the masses.

17:48.776 --> 17:54.530
Thou art a subject of the divine,
created in the image of man…

17:54.740 --> 17:58.826
…by the masses, for the masses.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.954
Let us be thankful we have commerce.

18:02.122 --> 18:06.000
Buy more. Buy more now.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.627
Buy…

18:07.795 --> 18:09.837
…and be happy.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.553
What's wrong?

18:17.763 --> 18:18.971
What's wrong?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.140
What's wrong?

18:22.059 --> 18:24.060
What's wrong?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.521
What's wrong?

18:27.064 --> 18:28.981
What's wrong?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.234
What's wrong?

18:31.401 --> 18:34.070
- What's wrong?
- Never mind.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.836
I was so afraid.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.134
So alone.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.895
I wanted to touch you…

19:50.439 --> 19:53.733
…so many times.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.780
I was happy.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.617
Why get me involved?

20:43.617 --> 20:45.493
They know.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.498
They've been watching us.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.959
I can feel it.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.629
No one knows.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.174
They're watching us now.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.470
No one can see us.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.256
I can…

21:40.465 --> 21:42.049
…feel it.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.527
Twenty-four.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.031
Twenty-three.

22:05.532 --> 22:06.574
Twenty-two.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.918
6442, gate five, please.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.598
We've got a malfunctioning
officer in corridor 7A.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.559
All right, just a minute.
Standby, scope 1.

23:03.799 --> 23:08.594
If you go back on sedation,
you won't feel the same way about me.

23:11.139 --> 23:14.141
You'll report me for drug violation.

23:14.851 --> 23:18.604
I've got a slip movement to install
on my next shift.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.608
I'll never make it the way I am now.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.701
I wouldn't turn you in, not now.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.662
- You don't…
- I know I wouldn't.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.872
You can do it without etracene.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.209
- You can. I know you can.
- Then what?

23:40.627 --> 23:43.504
It can't go on forever, you know it can't.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.715
We could leave.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.510
And live in the superstructure.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.139
You only have one more shift left,
don't you?

23:55.350 --> 23:58.644
We could be gone
before the next series started.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.497
It's all right.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.208
It's all right.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.627
Standing by.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.929
What's this?

24:35.390 --> 24:37.516
I have to see SEN.

24:37.684 --> 24:40.060
I've just been given a shift change.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.062
- When?
- Now.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.065
- Now?
- He wants me to come to his quarters.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.610
A shift change should come
through scheduling.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.862
Why should he want to see you?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.698
I don't know.

24:53.408 --> 24:56.410
- Don't go.
- I have to. He's a G34.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.579
You don't have to.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.085
I don't trust him.
You ought to file a report.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.379
No.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.466
Don't make trouble.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.551
It's nothing.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.929
Then why did you bring it up?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.931
I didn't.

25:17.724 --> 25:20.226
You asked me about the card.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.566
You're going to get us
into trouble.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.818
Do not push at the fountain.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.820
It's more work for the cleaning detail.

25:31.988 --> 25:35.074
- Did you copy that?
- The hung-over writing.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.243
Is he getting that?
Is he copying me?

25:37.410 --> 25:39.328
This is borough-flow submaster.

25:39.496 --> 25:40.955
Control, have you got that code?

25:41.122 --> 25:44.792
I read you very badly.
I'll check the message…

25:59.641 --> 26:01.600
- … hunter portapods.
- It's you.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.812
- Twenty-three hunter portapods.
- Come in. Sit down.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.774
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.

26:08.942 --> 26:13.654
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning…

26:13.822 --> 26:16.490
…and it's been going on all day.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.286
The roommate was destroyed,
you know.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.122
Terrible inconvenience.

26:24.666 --> 26:30.170
Have to try to see things in perspective,
do what you can…

26:31.840 --> 26:33.674
…to make things…

26:35.343 --> 26:36.844
…fit.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.805
I can accept things up to a point.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.141
But if you get a chance…

26:43.393 --> 26:44.893
…to make…

26:46.062 --> 26:47.855
…adjustments…

26:49.482 --> 26:51.692
…you're very foolish to pass them up.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.904
Where is LUH?

26:56.072 --> 26:59.158
- What?
- Your card, please.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.327
Thank you.

27:06.374 --> 27:09.043
This monitor is to be used…

27:09.210 --> 27:11.837
…for emergencies
or special requests only.

27:12.005 --> 27:15.341
All routine information
can easily be obtained…

27:15.508 --> 27:17.843
…through the bulletin panels
installed at…

27:20.180 --> 27:22.723
Why did you have LUH come here?

27:23.099 --> 27:25.225
Why are you so concerned?

27:25.852 --> 27:27.436
What's going on?

27:31.441 --> 27:34.360
I want you for my roommate.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.032
We'll be very good for one another.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.910
I don't understand. Living…

27:43.078 --> 27:45.579
Living selection is computed.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.625
I know what you're thinking.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.212
Program-shifting isn't
that major a crime, is it?

27:55.840 --> 27:58.092
You're in violation.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.636
Don't say that.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.557
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.727
We…

28:09.771 --> 28:12.606
…had a long talk.

28:13.233 --> 28:17.611
And she agreed that it would be better
for both of you to switch.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.906
She seemed to think that
you weren't accurately mated…

28:21.074 --> 28:23.283
…with her in the first place.

28:24.452 --> 28:28.247
I'll never have another mate like ONA.

28:29.249 --> 28:33.502
You rate very high in sanitation.
I've checked.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.633
I don't feel well.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.595
We'll be happy.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.483
With the economic
advantages of the mating structure…

28:56.651 --> 29:00.821
…it far surpasses any disadvantages
in increased perversions.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.322
A final trans…

29:02.490 --> 29:06.660
An infinite translated mathematics
of tolerance and charity…

29:06.828 --> 29:12.791
…among artificial memory devices
is ultimately binary.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.169
Stimulating rhetoric.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.672
LUH?

29:19.174 --> 29:20.966
Absolute.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.470
The theater of noise is proof
of our potential.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.348
The circulation of prototypes.

29:28.516 --> 29:33.562
The golden talisman underfoot
is phenomenon approaching.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.691
And in the history of now…

29:37.859 --> 29:40.861
…all ethos are designed.

29:48.578 --> 29:51.246
Why are you here?
You're not cleared for this area.

29:51.456 --> 29:55.876
You know I have a way with computers.
I can program myself for any area, almost.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.544
I'll report you.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.339
Listen, no need to be
distressed with me.

30:00.507 --> 30:04.051
- Get out of here, leave me alone.
- I've taken care of LUH.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.887
I programmed her to area 5450.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.765
The transfer should come through
by the next series.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.434
You're gonna need a new roommate.

30:23.863 --> 30:29.868
Performance
perfect is perfect performance.

30:49.931 --> 30:53.016
Your radiation rate is five…

30:53.268 --> 30:55.102
1138, retract.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.063
1138, retract.

30:58.231 --> 31:02.276
Something is touching
the TTO integrated logic modules.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.403
Switch tools.

31:04.904 --> 31:08.615
1138, what's wrong?
Would you like a stronger pill?

31:10.076 --> 31:13.453
1138, you're getting talmod contact.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.956
Retract at 220.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.625
Vector 079.

31:18.793 --> 31:24.464
We're making contact at .003.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.134
Don't override here. This is critical.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.596
Okay, you can start
your descent. That's it.

31:30.763 --> 31:34.474
Slow down just a little bit.
You're overriding .7.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.810
Okay, hold it, 1138.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.148
THX, do you read me? THX?

31:41.316 --> 31:43.150
The radiation rate…

31:43.318 --> 31:45.027
…is nine.

31:45.194 --> 31:49.615
THX, you're entering a critical phase.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.451
All right, contact. That's it.

31:52.619 --> 31:56.580
Respiratory count: 347, or plus 7.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.499
Adrenal off .74.

31:59.876 --> 32:04.463
We are receiving an extreme respiratory
count from a magnum manipulator…

32:04.631 --> 32:07.966
…in operating cell 94107.

32:08.134 --> 32:11.845
- Erratic visual behavior.
- Transfer control information.

32:12.013 --> 32:16.683
Current brain wave confirmation
on 1138: adrenal off .74.

32:16.851 --> 32:18.602
Analyze: severe.

32:18.853 --> 32:22.856
An explanation for blocking,
so allow me to make correction.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.360
You are entering a red phase, THX.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.154
1138 suffering
severe sedation depletion…

32:29.322 --> 32:31.073
…which requires mindlock and arrest.

32:31.240 --> 32:37.496
1138 filed a violation report on
SEN 5241 immediately prior to…

32:37.872 --> 32:42.084
Request mindlock
for operating cell 94107.

32:42.251 --> 32:46.046
Subject: 1138. Prefix: THX.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.175
Mindlock restricted.
Do not mindlock cell 9410…

32:50.343 --> 32:52.719
Priority shift. Repeat, priority…

32:53.513 --> 32:55.681
Mindlock pending.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.394
- Priority shift.
- Cut the mindlock. Hold all…

33:20.581 --> 33:23.166
Emergency in cell 94107.

33:29.090 --> 33:32.092
Evacuate all. Secure all atomic mass.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.928
Situation white. Repeat…

33:35.096 --> 33:37.931
…situation white.
Will somebody cut the mindlock?

33:39.434 --> 33:41.560
Clear. Clear.

33:41.936 --> 33:47.232
Who permitted a mindlock
priority in magnum cell 94107?

34:04.959 --> 34:07.127
Release mindlock.

34:08.087 --> 34:11.422
Relapse to command monitor.
Release mindlock.

34:16.763 --> 34:20.474
6241, is everything all right
down there? Did we ignore it?

34:22.101 --> 34:24.978
Control center 626
holds no responsibility…

34:25.146 --> 34:27.647
…for error in mindlock.

34:28.649 --> 34:31.610
Control center's
transreceiver, this is grid control.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.779
The power run incorporating
an H020 claim…

34:33.946 --> 34:35.864
…which blocked communication
in the…

34:36.032 --> 34:39.451
You should've reported
that the minute you first detected it.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.453
In any mindlock situation…

34:41.621 --> 34:44.289
…that is already put to character,
try and relieve it.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.680
Everything will be all right.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.016
You are in my hands.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.894
I am here to protect you.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.688
You have nowhere to go.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.483
You have nowhere to go.

35:23.037 --> 35:29.709
1138 THX is charged with violation
appendix 445 to 613, index 78.7.

35:29.877 --> 35:35.048
Drug evasion, malicious sexual
perversion and transgression.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.219
Immediate destruction on the basis
of an ECO-TRX 314…

35:39.387 --> 35:42.889
…incurable imbalance
with socially deteriorating conscience.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.016
Reject. Reject.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.811
Inefficient, unwarranted destruction.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.859
- Must be saved…
- Allowed erotics to exist…

35:54.026 --> 35:57.779
- Inane. What is the prosecution doing?
- But there can be no doubt…

35:57.947 --> 36:01.783
- Records show he is of clinic origin.
- Remotely subject to alteration.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.536
If society is to free itself
of these deviants…

36:04.704 --> 36:07.622
- This is not a race issue.
- He must be destroyed.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.417
We must not continue
to consume these erotics.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.919
We must exterminate the source of sin.

36:13.087 --> 36:17.424
Economics must not dictate situations
which are obviously religious.

36:17.592 --> 36:21.970
Masses won.
Defendant used, not destroyed.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.471
Case rest.

36:31.105 --> 36:33.440
1138, prefix THX…

36:33.608 --> 36:36.151
…is pronounced incurable…

36:36.944 --> 36:39.279
…and shall be conditioned…

36:39.447 --> 36:42.157
…and held in detention.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.764
Are you now?

37:05.932 --> 37:07.974
Or have you ever been?

37:11.103 --> 37:13.605
1642, try 612.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.941
He seems to have an 818.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.026
Can you feel this?

37:18.527 --> 37:20.195
4814…

37:20.404 --> 37:23.615
…avoid the 714 and the 2336.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.325
All right.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.122
3334, that's right.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.918
Concentrate on the tri-14 area.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.630
Move slowly.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.926
63410. Wait for 32.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.515
9.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.643
3437.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.234
Now the 5552.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.154
The 4105.

38:04.323 --> 38:08.201
Above the 521. The 122.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.830
Skip the 1114.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.375
- What do you say, 56?
- The 321.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.168
And 21.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.920
Under the 69.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.340
That's enough.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.246
Can I borrow one of your etracenes?

40:58.497 --> 41:00.540
Uh… Sure.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.376
I think that the
lesson'll go a lot better…

41:03.544 --> 41:06.546
Let's write this up. You said 45 on the…

41:06.714 --> 41:09.048
All right. Should we zoom
this a little here?

41:09.216 --> 41:11.217
Here, I'll just zoom it.

41:11.385 --> 41:12.927
Hey, doesn't it zoom like…?

41:13.137 --> 41:16.264
Now, what have you been
checked out on over at level 387?

41:16.432 --> 41:19.559
Well, at 387, our system
was never completed. We'd use…

41:19.727 --> 41:22.896
So you haven't any experience
with the Mark 8 board? Never…

41:23.063 --> 41:25.106
No, but the Mark 7,
you had the same…

41:25.274 --> 41:29.068
You could just open them up as if…
Open all four up.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.529
Yeah. You ought to be careful
about the…

41:34.658 --> 41:37.869
You got any polarity here
on the mobile travel? Look.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.955
- What…?
- I just punched up one and I'm opening…

41:45.794 --> 41:49.881
…imagine that that has something to do
with the results the 378 was getting.

41:56.597 --> 41:59.724
That's it. Okay, now watch
that reading. And as it…

41:59.892 --> 42:04.145
- Watch the needle on 5, now. Watch…
MAN 2: This… This knob is loose.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.064
Wait, which switch gets it out?

42:06.232 --> 42:08.983
Master at the bottom.
Okay, there we are.

42:09.193 --> 42:14.239
What is the real dope
on the cortex bond problem, anyway?

42:14.406 --> 42:15.949
Oh, you find yourself with…

42:20.788 --> 42:24.457
Don't let it get above 4.8.
Look at this.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.334
- Little monkey.
- I cut myself.

42:31.465 --> 42:35.093
What if you put a dual display on it
and I punch two up?

42:35.261 --> 42:36.803
Yes, you can see two at once.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.931
When you see three, punch a third.
The numbers read…

42:40.099 --> 42:44.310
Yeah. So it's best to go back to two.
And really, to get an accurate reading…

42:47.106 --> 42:49.983
- I don't see any dissolution here.
- You haven't…

42:51.151 --> 42:54.320
Don't let it get above 4.7.

42:55.322 --> 42:58.032
Here, I'll bring these back down
a little bit.

42:58.242 --> 43:02.245
- Yeah, I seem to be overloading it.
- You should put… Instead of…

43:07.334 --> 43:09.002
There it is, 4.6. All right?

43:09.169 --> 43:11.879
Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.756
Oh, yeah?

43:54.548 --> 43:56.341
Are you all right?

44:04.224 --> 44:06.184
What did they do to you?

44:13.233 --> 44:14.901
What? What?

44:15.069 --> 44:17.236
I'm going to have a child.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.329
Hold me.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.748
Hold me.

45:23.470 --> 45:27.890
- Come on, stand up.
- We are only here to help you.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.143
- You have…
ROBOT 1: Watch it.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.687
Come on, now.
We don't wanna hurt you.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.605
Let go.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.650
We won't harm you.

45:37.818 --> 45:40.486
We only want to help you.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.708
3927, could you get him
from where you are?

46:23.697 --> 46:27.325
THX 1138.

46:42.382 --> 46:44.008
Hi.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.358
I know you turned me in.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.906
I'm doing quite well here anyway.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.035
I'm setting some things up…

47:11.203 --> 47:13.704
…but it isn't easy.

47:13.872 --> 47:18.251
A very difficult balance, you know?

47:19.753 --> 47:24.048
Listen. Now, let's get something straight
right from the start.

47:24.216 --> 47:27.385
It's gonna take you some time
to see my overall plans.

47:27.553 --> 47:31.055
So until then, stay out of things
you don't understand, right?

47:31.431 --> 47:34.767
You're gonna be making things
more difficult for me.

47:36.770 --> 47:40.773
It's the least you can do. Huh?

47:42.901 --> 47:44.819
What's wrong with you?

47:48.740 --> 47:54.036
- Don't be like that.
- It's all right. You're safe now.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.800
When posterity judges our actions here…

48:07.968 --> 48:11.429
…it will perhaps see us
not as unwilling prisoners…

48:11.597 --> 48:13.764
…but as men who,
for whatever reason…

48:13.932 --> 48:18.811
…preferred to remain as non-contributing
individuals on the edge of society.

48:18.979 --> 48:22.273
- We must not let this happen.
- Countless diversions.

48:22.441 --> 48:25.359
- Gentlemen, the choice is there.
- Reciting where we are.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.653
- Arguing about leaving.
- Make no mistake.

48:27.821 --> 48:30.781
- Predicting the future. Ridiculous.
- We must choose a leader…

48:30.949 --> 48:34.452
What about keeping it livable?
- …to unite us together.

48:34.620 --> 48:39.165
- LUH 9998.
- LUH?

48:39.333 --> 48:43.711
Uh…
MAN 2: What happened? Who's gone?

48:44.463 --> 48:47.632
- JOT.
- My friend, your point of view…

48:49.301 --> 48:51.844
…yes, CAM, that's it.

48:52.012 --> 48:54.889
Your point is well taken, CAM…

48:55.098 --> 48:56.974
…but it lacks the balance
that a broader…

48:57.142 --> 48:59.644
…and deeper range
of experience can lend it.

49:00.103 --> 49:03.981
When I first arrived here,
I saw things as perhaps you do now.

49:04.149 --> 49:06.817
Yes, I was confused
about my predicament.

49:07.361 --> 49:11.739
I longed to thrash out, to tear down,
to destroy and annihilate…

49:11.907 --> 49:16.243
…to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.705
Being basically levelheaded, however…

49:19.873 --> 49:23.876
…I realized that my first goal
should be to study this place…

49:24.044 --> 49:27.546
…where what seemed
blind circumstance had placed me.

49:27.714 --> 49:30.007
Listen to the mumblings of an old man…

49:30.175 --> 49:35.388
…and bank those flames with earnest
inquiry and honest observation.

49:35.889 --> 49:36.931
"Mumblings."

49:38.350 --> 49:41.894
"Mumblings," you hear? Know how many
times we listened to that speech?

49:42.062 --> 49:46.732
Do you know how many times
we've had to listen to that speech?

49:47.359 --> 49:49.860
Thinks we're as blind as him.
Know what you are?

49:50.028 --> 49:52.196
You make me sick.
If we thought like you…

49:52.364 --> 49:55.908
You know what I want?
I want ideas. I want one idea.

49:56.076 --> 49:59.704
One idea could get us out of here!

50:01.081 --> 50:03.207
We'll have to be sure
it's the right idea.

50:03.375 --> 50:06.544
We'll know it when we see it.
I'll know it when I see it!

50:06.712 --> 50:10.881
Clear and straightforward
and plain as the nose on your face.

50:13.760 --> 50:16.762
Talked to oneself over…

50:16.930 --> 50:20.224
… believed he was going
to a place where he'd be happy.

50:20.392 --> 50:25.896
And in so believing, he created a
veritable paradise for himself right here.

50:26.940 --> 50:31.736
Unfortunately, not all of us can have
the positive conviction of LOO.

50:31.903 --> 50:36.949
But thankfully, not all of us are burdened
with the ominous forebodings of SEN.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.784
I, myself…

50:46.251 --> 50:47.626
That's what I mean by the
wrong idea.

50:47.794 --> 50:50.796
Look, I'm not going to try to prove
the usefulness of history.

50:50.964 --> 50:54.717
It is genuinely too obvious
to need proof.

51:03.477 --> 51:06.270
I want to help you.

51:06.938 --> 51:09.774
You can help me.

51:10.275 --> 51:11.776
Here.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.153
Take a biscuit.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.157
You understand,
we're all in this together.

51:18.992 --> 51:21.827
You want to leave. You're not like them.

51:21.995 --> 51:23.662
A secret that we all get out of here…

51:25.040 --> 51:28.959
Take it easy! Look at them.
It's pathetic. It's pitiful.

51:29.127 --> 51:32.338
They've even begun to go into
my corner and look for things.

51:32.506 --> 51:33.839
My things.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.800
You're with me.

51:35.967 --> 51:37.510
I know.

51:38.345 --> 51:39.845
I have a contract.

51:40.013 --> 51:42.306
All it says is:

51:46.645 --> 51:48.646
"You're with me."

51:48.814 --> 51:50.856
We're all in this together.

51:53.151 --> 51:55.319
We must convince the others.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.199
Later, then.

52:12.337 --> 52:15.214
We need a new unity.

52:15.382 --> 52:18.384
And not a unity
which discourages dissent.

52:18.718 --> 52:22.930
We need dissent,
but we need a creative dissent.

52:23.223 --> 52:26.559
Our voices are not raised
in any harmonious chorus…

52:26.726 --> 52:32.398
…but our differences are differences
of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.

52:32.858 --> 52:38.904
- Tomorrow, as we…
ROBOT: Nondescript 6431399.

52:43.618 --> 52:46.078
- What is it?
- A shell dweller.

52:46.246 --> 52:48.789
They live in the outer shell. Quite unique.

52:48.957 --> 52:52.209
There have been two here before
and they smell.

52:52.377 --> 52:54.211
What do you know?

52:57.924 --> 52:59.758
Come here, my friend.

52:59.926 --> 53:01.760
Let me touch you.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.120
What'd he just do?

53:28.580 --> 53:31.248
What's wrong, huh?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.127
Your lunch is dirty. What a waste.

53:35.295 --> 53:37.671
Here, we can save some of it.

53:41.301 --> 53:43.010
It's all right.

53:43.970 --> 53:46.388
Everything's fine.

54:12.165 --> 54:13.457
What?

54:14.042 --> 54:16.669
Well, if you didn't want it,
why'd you take it?

54:17.462 --> 54:21.840
I thought this was all settled. Hm?

54:26.304 --> 54:27.888
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.

54:28.056 --> 54:30.557
Leaving? Leaving what?
You can't leave.

54:30.725 --> 54:33.352
You can't go. Hey, wait.

54:33.687 --> 54:36.313
Oh, I know, the smell. Yeah, it's terrible.

54:37.857 --> 54:39.650
It's a little bit…

54:39.818 --> 54:42.987
Hey, you can't…
You can't leave without…

54:43.947 --> 54:45.531
Just a minute.

54:45.699 --> 54:49.034
Wait. Just wait there a minute.

54:49.202 --> 54:51.912
After long deliberation,
I have decided to go out…

54:52.080 --> 54:54.373
…and personally examine the barrier…

54:54.541 --> 54:57.501
…to learn firsthand
what difficulties are involved…

54:57.669 --> 55:01.213
…and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk…

55:01.381 --> 55:05.217
…but moments such as these require
a choice be made and action taken…

55:05.385 --> 55:08.095
…regardless of the danger.
We'll be back soon…

55:08.263 --> 55:12.224
…but we'll be gone long enough to form
an accurate and functional escape.

55:12.392 --> 55:16.520
And I shall have an honest idea how best
to organize us into a working unit.

55:16.688 --> 55:20.399
- The new alignment.
- Incredible.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.902
Wait. Wait. Hey, wait for me.

55:24.070 --> 55:27.906
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.

55:28.074 --> 55:32.036
When we get back, they'll be right there,
right in the palm of my hand.

55:32.495 --> 55:35.247
There's no question.
Even old PTO would be with us…

55:35.415 --> 55:37.541
…if he'd still been advised.

55:47.594 --> 55:52.139
How far before they can't
see us anymore, huh?

55:52.307 --> 55:55.059
Maybe we better sit down right here.

55:55.643 --> 55:57.936
Hey, rest for a while.

55:59.439 --> 56:00.773
I can't…

56:01.608 --> 56:03.901
I can't see them anymore.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.403
LUH.

56:07.072 --> 56:08.989
You're going after LUH, aren't you?

56:09.157 --> 56:11.116
Why, it's ridiculous.

56:13.119 --> 56:14.953
Going after…

56:16.456 --> 56:19.416
Oh, wait, I knew there was something
I had to tell you.

56:19.584 --> 56:23.921
Uh, LUH, you know, the other,
the new LUH?

56:24.089 --> 56:28.092
He told me he'd seen her. He saw
her just before he came out here.

56:28.259 --> 56:30.761
- She's gonna be coming out here.
- How was she?

56:30.929 --> 56:34.431
Oh, very well. Very good health.
Just exactly the way…

56:34.599 --> 56:38.143
- You're lying.
- No, I am not.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.650
The air's getting thinner.

56:46.444 --> 56:49.488
Or pressure's getting greater.

56:50.573 --> 56:52.658
It's the pressure.

56:54.202 --> 56:55.953
How do you feel?

56:57.330 --> 56:59.373
Shouldn't be this far.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.212
There's no air.

57:13.096 --> 57:16.348
I haven't got the time.
You can stay here if you like.

57:20.145 --> 57:21.603
I'll come with you.

57:27.861 --> 57:29.319
What?

57:32.198 --> 57:33.699
Look.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.242
What?

57:37.036 --> 57:38.745
That's a man.

57:39.205 --> 57:42.166
It's a man. He's waving.
He's waving to us.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.522
Hi.

58:05.773 --> 58:07.232
Hi.

58:09.235 --> 58:10.861
Hello.

58:12.197 --> 58:15.908
Uh, where'd you guys come from?

58:18.036 --> 58:21.121
Oh, well, it doesn't make any difference.
Is that food?

58:21.289 --> 58:23.874
I'm starving. Do you mind?

58:27.712 --> 58:29.463
How did you get here?

58:29.672 --> 58:31.465
I mean, I was lost.

58:31.674 --> 58:33.717
- You're not lost now?
- Uh-uh.

58:34.761 --> 58:36.720
- Know the way out?
- Uh-huh.

58:36.888 --> 58:39.223
- That's the way out.
- That's the way we came.

58:39.390 --> 58:42.768
Yeah, but maybe you traveled in circles.
That's the way out.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.228
How do you know?

58:44.395 --> 58:45.896
Well, look.

58:46.898 --> 58:49.191
Look more closely. You see?

58:50.109 --> 58:51.401
Come on.

58:51.569 --> 58:53.111
Oh, yeah.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.133
Nothing stopped us.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.470
Come on.

59:19.847 --> 59:21.640
Here's a doorway.

59:23.309 --> 59:24.977
Keep causeways clean.

59:26.813 --> 59:29.773
Save time. Save lives.

59:31.651 --> 59:34.111
Keep causeways clean.

59:35.613 --> 59:38.031
Save time, save lives.

59:39.993 --> 59:42.995
Keep causeways clean.

59:43.871 --> 59:46.456
Save time, save lives.

59:48.293 --> 59:50.002
Keep causeways clean.

59:51.754 --> 59:54.172
Save time, save lives.

59:57.343 --> 01:00:00.137
Keep causeways clean.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.517
Save time, save lives.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.986
- Hello, 12.
- This is security B.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.404
Read me, synapse module?

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.740
Research into relay system
must be given…

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.495
…intercerebral process reported earlier.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:31.376
How shall the new environment
be programmed?

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:34.880
It all happened so slowly that…

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:39.718
…most men failed to realize
that anything had happened at all.

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:45.057
I wonder what happened to SEN.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.893
We'll never make it through
that main way.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:51.730
- Who are you?
- I'm a hologram.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:55.567
I'm not real. You know,
the fantasy bureau…

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.362
…electrically-generated realities
and all that.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.368
I was stuck in the same circuit
for too long.

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:07.079
The arm and leg routine,
did you see that one?

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:14.252
I always wanted to be part
of the real world.

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:16.922
So I left.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.261
Hey, look.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.808
You are engaged
in an unauthorized procedure.

01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:29.935
Remain where you are. This…

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:32.896
We have a U65 on a K8.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:35.440
Transfer all unauthorized contacts…

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:40.445
…in precinct 688 Con-G
to this center, mode 7.

01:01:54.627 --> 01:02:00.841
Termination
of exurban links DD, NEC-08.

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:05.929
This tram will return
to the Central Web in five minutes.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:46.071
This is 91021 on case 918.
We are going to need assistance.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.240
This is an electronic-restricted area.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.535
It would be nice to have
three additional officers.

01:03:51.702 --> 01:03:55.121
- Have you seen them?
- No. They must be in group 9.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:57.374
Operation 5271.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.450
Budget Control…

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:16.328
…we'd like a cost analysis
on the THX 1138 account.

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:18.997
Include all interest
and inflation percentages.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:23.460
Expenditures are 649 and rising.

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:36.514
- What was that?
- Must be an expressway.

01:05:36.682 --> 01:05:39.184
This is Budget Control.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.896
The expenditure ceiling
on the THX case is 14,000 credits.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:47.859
Remember, thrifty thinkers
are always under budget.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:55.200
Would you like part of this?
It's not very much.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:07.837
Did you know all the insides
are gone from all these people?

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.386
Halt.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.944
Economics make it
necessary to terminate any operation…

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:16.114
…which exceeds 5 percent
of its primary budget.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:19.784
Expenditures are 1000 and rising.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:57.113
Things don't seem to make sense.

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:01.659
Sometimes I see things get left out…

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.621
…and they don't fit.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.123
People don't seem to see them.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.293
Or they don't know what to do.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.004
Sometimes I…

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.131
Sometimes little…

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:19.636
A little adjustment…

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:22.180
…can make all the difference.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.392
I wanna do the right thing.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.685
I wanna go back.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:31.648
I… I…

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:35.151
I can… I can start again.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:39.531
I can change.

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:44.035
I can… I can help.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.706
I just need a…

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:53.211
Need to rest up for a little while.

01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:57.756
This is no place for prayer.

01:08:57.925 --> 01:09:02.053
If you want to speak to OMM, you must
go to a unichapel, you know that.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.221
- Yeah.
- What?

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.725
- Are you in any trouble?
- No. I'm okay. I'm going now.

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:11.938
What's your number and your prefix?
I'm gonna see this gets into your report.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:13.689
No, I'm leaving now.

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:16.859
I'm sorry, I have to report all intruders.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:20.113
- Where's your identification badge?
- I lost it.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:23.533
You're in violation.
I'll have to report you to authorities.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:26.118
No, it's not my time.
Please, just…

01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:56.357
Trapped.

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:00.737
Trapped.

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:14.626
Looks like the only way out
is the way we came in.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:21.758
Say, do you have any more
of that food? I'm hungry.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:24.177
She's not there.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.971
Who are you looking for?

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:33.269
Can you hear me? Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.022
The door seems to be jammed.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:39.192
Please check the lock on your side.

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:44.822
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.200
Stay calm.

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.662
We are not going to harm you.

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:52.622
Everything will be all right.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:59.629
Well, unless that computer
has made a mistake…

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.297
…that's your roommate.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.136
No. No, you're wrong.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.685
I hope that auxiliary load holds.

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:16.437
I'm almost through
to the upper positive plates.

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:18.856
Upper positive plates?

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:26.155
Maybe you are right. Maybe there's
something wrong with the computer.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.825
I don't know. It's a strange life.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.995
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers
and all those things.

01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:34.956
I guess I'll never understand
any of that stuff.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.334
Guess maybe holograms
are not supposed to.

01:11:47.594 --> 01:11:50.847
THX 1138
will be taken into custody…

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:53.391
…at a minimal monetary expenditure.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:57.103
Total operation cost:
6000 credits under budget.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:59.564
Congratulations. Be efficient…

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.899
- …be happy.
- Thank you.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:05.403
Are you all right in there?

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:13.578
Proceed to dispersal center 21.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.414
Projected route of flight
will be transferred.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:30.136
Termination

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:33.931
This tram will return
to the Central Web in five…

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:50.656
What is that? An inducer?

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:54.410
- Did it fall off?
- Yeah.

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.747
Um…

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:00.083
- How…?
- What're you doing?

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:02.085
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

01:13:02.252 --> 01:13:03.753
Hello.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:06.756
Let me see that again.
I think I got it.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.758
Here, give me your arm.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.136
You know…

01:13:12.596 --> 01:13:15.765
…when I was at school,
it was all very different.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:20.770
We used to stay in bed all the time.
Combined primary economics…

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.649
Combined primary economics
was a bottle about this big.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:27.068
- Took a week.
- Wow.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.863
A visual contact with 5241 SEN.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.449
Two officers to pick up felon SEN.

01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:36.494

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:41.707
…of felon 5241 SEN. Current position…

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:05.398
To avoid being singed by jet exhaust,
please exit your vehicle on the right…

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:09.485
…and walk through the blue zone

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:06.209
Be sure to report all decibel surges…

01:15:06.376 --> 01:15:10.880
…in excess of 1.5
on the Murrer-Wiggins scale.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:16.385
…And stand to the right. If you wish
to pass, please do so on the left.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:19.555
Fourstar vehicles at the observation…

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.441
There's been an accident in level…

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.452
I think I ran over a Wookiee
back there on the expressway.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.497
Central, Central Control.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:50.253

…proves its analogy to the J20 series.

01:16:08.146 --> 01:16:11.440
We have an accident in 821.

Plastic.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:23.554
… 185, group 26,
corner 185, that is correct.

01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:57.421
Clear traffic in central left web.

01:17:57.589 --> 01:18:00.049
Officers are 300 and closing.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:03.052
Officers are 285 and closing.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:15.981
Expenditures are 10,000 and rising.

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:17.942
Expenditures are…

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:29.161
Officers are 270 and closing.

01:19:11.037 --> 01:19:13.998
…212, too many vehicles on code on B.

01:19:42.652 --> 01:19:45.196

to have stopped on expressway…

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:49.867

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:58.936
Vehicle's at 115,
approaching Expressway 300.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:02.898
All right, then,
I'm gonna… See him on scope 1.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:08.112
… into the internal-module
control pulses, a nine.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.948
Now, this is the 619.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.659
A brand-new 6071.

01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:17.288
This lodging network converts
the buffered memory signals…

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:29.008
Vehicle entering
a restricted-access expressway.

01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:31.260
Vehicle is a Samos 3.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:58.495
Expenditures are 14,000.

01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:00.831
I'll show you.
These modules are made by…

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:03.459
You exceeded your primary budget.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.520
Stop your vehicle.

01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:26.857
You are approaching a work area.
Stop your vehicle.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:31.528
You are traveling in a restricted-access
expressway. Stop your vehicle.

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:34.198
Do you read? Do you read?

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:42.539
He's headed
for that construction site at tunnel 400.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.340
Approaching the area…

01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:54.259
…at 235 miles per hour.

01:22:56.721 --> 01:22:59.598
A vehicle is entering
a restricted-access express…

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:03.769
Construction personnel,
evacuate area. Evacuate area.

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:10.275
Control, he's in the area.
He's now passed into expressway…

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.529
He appears to be headed
for that construction site.

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:40.556
Mission control…

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:17.926
We've lost him.

01:24:18.094 --> 01:24:20.679
Can you pick him up on the electroscan?
Thank you.

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:22.806
We have a sonar fix on subject.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:26.268
- Yes, we hear it.
- That's him.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:28.479
It sounds like shell dwellers.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:53.295
He appears
to be heading outside the city.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:55.339
Repeat, he is heading outside the city.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.800
All I can do is note your information.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.469
Stand by.

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:21.323
Please come back.
You have nothing to be afraid of.

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:37.548
The THX account
is 6 percent over budget.

01:25:37.715 --> 01:25:39.925
The case is to be terminated.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:42.344
Discontinue operation.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:45.055
Report to thermal station 62.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:47.516
Discontinue operation.

01:25:47.725 --> 01:25:50.018
We have to go back.

01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:54.940
This is your last chance
to return with us.

01:25:56.067 --> 01:25:58.902
You have nowhere to go.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:04.199
You cannot survive outside the city shell.

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:08.579
We only want to help you.

01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:12.541
This is your last chance.
