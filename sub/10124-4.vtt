09:04.100 --> 09:07.734
CONSIDERING THAT
ALL THESE PAPERS
ARE BLANK.

09:07.734 --> 09:10.700
I GUESS THAT WILL
KILL THE CURVE.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.467
DO YOU MEAN
TO TELL ME

09:13.467 --> 09:16.000
THAT YOUR STUDENTS REFUSE
TO TAKE THE TEST?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.934
THAT'S THE DECISION
THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.700
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND, MAN?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.600
WE HAD A DEAL.
I GAVE THEM THE TEST.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.000
INTERESTINGLY, THEY
GAVE IT BACK TO ME.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.300
WELL, OF COURSE THEY DID,
EARRING BOY.

09:38.100 --> 09:42.500
I REALIZE
THAT ALL YOU
SEVENTH-GRADERS

09:42.500 --> 09:45.600
ARE DELICATE,
ADOLESCENT FLOWERS

09:45.600 --> 09:48.834
JUST BEGINNING
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BLOOMING.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.800
AND SO I SAY THIS

09:51.800 --> 09:55.100
WITH UTMOST SENSITIVITY.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.300
TAKE THIS TEST...

09:57.300 --> 09:58.900
OR DIE.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.500
YOU JUST HAVE TO
LET THEM KNOW
WHO'S BOSS.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.767
IS THIS FAIR?

10:11.767 --> 10:12.867
NO!
NO!

10:12.867 --> 10:14.100
HAVE WE BEEN TRICKED?

10:14.100 --> 10:15.100
YES!
YES!

10:15.100 --> 10:17.233
TAKE THE TEST OR DIE?

10:17.233 --> 10:18.200
DIE!
DIE!

10:18.200 --> 10:21.000
THEN WE DIE TOGETHER,
ORGANIZED,

10:21.000 --> 10:22.500
LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THE BOOK
SHOULD HAVE DONE.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.934

'CAUSE IF I HAD DONE

THAT SENTENCE.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.200
I CAN'T.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.500
THEN TRUST ME.
WITH EVERY TICK
OF THE CLOCK,

11:33.500 --> 11:34.967
THE COURAGE
IS DRAINING OUT

11:34.967 --> 11:37.100
OF THEIR DEFIANT
LITTLE SOULS.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.400
WHAT ARE WE?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.767
WE ARE KINGS!

11:39.767 --> 11:41.567
AND WHAT DO KINGS SAY?

11:44.100 --> 11:46.233
THEY SAY NO MORE MACARONI.

11:46.233 --> 11:47.900
NO MORE MACARONI!

11:47.900 --> 11:49.300
WE WANT STEAK!

11:49.300 --> 11:50.500
WE WANT STEAK!

11:50.500 --> 11:53.233
AND WHAT DO WE WANT
WITH OUR STEAK?

11:53.233 --> 11:55.033
MACARONI!

11:57.200 --> 12:00.066
NO, WE DON'T LIKE
MACARONI.

12:00.066 --> 12:01.900

12:03.000 --> 12:05.800

12:07.934 --> 12:08.934
YOU'RE RIGHT, GEORGE.

12:08.934 --> 12:10.100
THEY ARE QUAKING
IN THEIR BOOTS.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.400
SO THEY HAVE
A CERTAIN PLUCK.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.100
IF I HAD DONE TO ME
WHAT THEY HAD DONE--

12:15.100 --> 12:16.600
THAT'S GETTING OLD,
HOTSHOT.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.600
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LET THEM BURN OUT?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.400
YOU DON'T WANT TO
BREAK THEIR SPIRIT.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.567
PLEASE, I HAVE BEEN
AN EDUCATOR
FOR 35 YEARS.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.767
I KNOW HOW TO RELATE
TO MY STUDENTS.

12:25.767 --> 12:29.000
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
YOUR WARDEN SPEAKING.

12:30.567 --> 12:33.967
SO YOU WANT TO PLAY
ROUGH WITH GEORGE FEENY?

12:33.967 --> 12:35.500
HEH HEH HEH!

12:37.300 --> 12:40.867
FINE. WE'LL TAKE OFF
THE GLOVES.

12:40.867 --> 12:42.200
UH-OH.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.367
THE SEVENTH GRADE DANCE
IS HEREBY CANCELED.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.200
YOU CAN'T
DO THAT.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.600
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.200
I HAVE THE MEGAPHONE.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.500
HERE'S A DOOZY.

FOOTBALL SEASON...

12:56.667 --> 12:57.834
OH, NO.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.200
CANCELED.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.300

13:00.300 --> 13:02.300
YES, MR. HUNTER.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.100
NO CHEERLEADERS.

13:04.100 --> 13:07.300

13:07.300 --> 13:10.000

A STRIKE.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.300

MAKE SACRIFICES.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.200
BUT HE'S TAKING MY GIRLS.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.300
WHY CAN'T
WE JUST SACRIFICE YOU?

13:19.834 --> 13:22.200
NOW I WOULD PREFER YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR CLASSES

13:22.200 --> 13:23.567

FROM THE OLD MALL,

15:19.200 --> 15:22.100

WE DID WASN'T SMART,

UP FOR OUR PRINCIPLES.

YOU WANT TO TALK
TO HOFFA AND COSTELLO?

17:13.100 --> 17:17.033
YEAH. I DON'T USUALLY
MAKE HOUSE CALLS,

17:17.033 --> 17:18.867
BUT THIS ALL STARTED
IN MY CLASSROOM,

17:18.867 --> 17:21.734
SO I THOUGHT I MIGHT
STEP IN AND MEDIATE.

17:21.734 --> 17:23.500

ARE YOU?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500

MR. TURNER, ALL WE DID

17:30.600 --> 17:32.200
WAS READ
<i>THE GRAPES OF WRATH.</i>

17:32.200 --> 17:33.567
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WE LEARNED?

17:33.567 --> 17:35.100
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR YOUR RIGHTS.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.100
THAT'S WHY
WE WENT ON STRIKE.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.667
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.600
THAT'LL TEACH ME
TO READ A BOOK.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.100
SO I GUESS THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS

17:43.100 --> 17:45.300

TRY TO STAND UP
TO THE BOSSES.

YOU NEED TO GO

TAKE ACTION IF
YOU'RE PREPARED

FOR THOSE ACTIONS.

THAT YOU'RE STILL STUDENTS

IN SCHOOL

18:38.200 --> 18:39.934

AND PROTECTED

18:39.934 --> 18:42.700

BY THE RULES
THAT GO WITH THAT.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.367
NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT TEST OR HIS?

18:53.300 --> 18:56.734
THEY GOT US
SURROUNDED.

18:56.734 --> 18:59.133
I GUESS WE'D BETTER
TALK TO FEENY.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.000
YEAH, GUESS YOU BETTER.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.300
FACE IT, GUYS.
FEENY'S NOT
GOING TO GO AWAY.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.200
HE'S GOING TO BE
ALL OVER YOUR CASE.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.400
YOU TURN AROUND,
HE'S GOING TO BE
THERE.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.900
NOW THAT'S SCARY.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.100
YOU KNOW YOU GOT
A PRINCIPAL
LIVING NEXT DOOR?

19:14.100 --> 19:17.600
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
WE BRAG ABOUT.

19:19.233 --> 19:22.000
GEORGE, YOU LIVE
NEXT DOOR TO MATTHEWS?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.100
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I BRAG ABOUT.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.200
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE,
MR. TURNER?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.033
I CAME TO TALK
TO THE BOYS.

19:30.033 --> 19:32.500
TURNS OUT THEY HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.567
LOOK, MR. FEENY,
WE GOT IT ALL WRONG

19:35.567 --> 19:39.200
BECAUSE WE READ
THIS BOOK ALL THE WAY
TO THE BEGINNING.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.467
REALLY? AND I DON'T
SUPPOSE YOU LEARNED
ANYTHING FROM IT.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.734
WE LEARNED YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO FIGHT BACK

19:45.734 --> 19:47.467
AGAINST WHAT YOU THINK
IS UNFAIR.

19:47.467 --> 19:50.967
AND THAT'S THE PARALLEL
YOU DREW FROM
THE JOAD FAMILY?

19:50.967 --> 19:53.400
THEY WERE OUT
IN THE REAL WORLD.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.500
THEY KNEW THEY
HAD SOMETHING BIG
TO FIGHT FOR.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.400
AND HOW DO THE JOADS
RELATE TO YOU?

19:57.400 --> 19:59.033
I GUESS THEY DON'T.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.900
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST KIDS.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.600
WE'RE NOT REALLY OUT
IN THE WORLD YET.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.000
THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT,
NOWHERE TO LIVE.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.767
ALL THEY KNEW WAS
THAT THEY DESERVED
A DECENT WAGE.

20:09.767 --> 20:12.200
AND ALL WE KNOW IS...

20:12.200 --> 20:14.500
NOTHING.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.734
AND WHEREVER
THERE'S A GUY

20:16.734 --> 20:18.100
WHO DON'T KNOW
NOTHING,

20:18.100 --> 20:21.133
I'LL BE THERE.

20:23.467 --> 20:27.000
WELL SAID.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.767
IT'S FROM THE BOOK.
I ACTUALLY READ IT.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.233
I BELIEVE YOU DID,

20:32.233 --> 20:34.734
AND I'LL TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.300
THAT WILL BE ALL.
YOU CAN GO.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.233
WELL, MR. TURNER,
I MUST ADMIT

20:44.233 --> 20:46.967
THEY SOUND AS IF
THEY ACTUALLY
KNOW THE MATERIAL.

20:46.967 --> 20:48.800
YEAH, AND WE
FOUND THAT OUT

20:48.800 --> 20:50.467
WITHOUT GIVING THEM
A TEST.

20:50.467 --> 20:51.967
OH?

20:51.967 --> 20:54.667
YOU DON'T CALL
WHAT THEY JUST WENT
THROUGH A TEST?

20:54.667 --> 20:58.700
I'D CALL IT
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE,
MR. FEENY.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.200
THANK YOU.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.100
YES, WELL,
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.667
I'M ALIVE AGAIN.
DESIREE'S OUT
OF MY LIFE.

21:12.667 --> 21:15.233
I CAN PLAY ROUNDBALL
WITH MY BUDS
ANYTIME I WANT.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.600
WHY AREN'T
YOU DRESSED?

21:16.600 --> 21:19.400
I SHOULDN'T PLAY.
I'VE BEEN HOLDING
YOU GUYS BACK.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.500
I'M JUST TOO PETITE.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.967
[PAGER BEEPS]

21:22.967 --> 21:23.967
WHAT WAS THAT?

21:23.967 --> 21:24.967
WHAT WAS WHAT?

21:24.967 --> 21:26.000
[BEEP BEEP]

21:26.000 --> 21:27.200
THAT.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.500
THAT.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.033
THAT WAS MY PACEMAKER.

21:31.033 --> 21:34.734
IN FACT, I'M HAVING
A HEART ATTACK RIGHT NOW.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.567
IT'S THE PAGER.

21:38.567 --> 21:40.734
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY PAGE,

21:40.734 --> 21:43.300
MY LITTLE RAISINETTE.

21:43.300 --> 21:47.600
I'M SORRY.
IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
JUST BE SURE
TO PICK ME UP IN TIME

21:49.600 --> 21:51.500
FOR MY PEDICURE.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.400
SAY YES, PUDDIN'.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.867
YES.

21:57.867 --> 22:00.233
I BELIEVE THE WOMAN
WANTS PUDDIN'.

22:03.567 --> 22:06.867
PUDDIN'.

22:12.033 --> 22:15.600
WHAT? I'M ONLY IN IT
FOR THE BREAKUP KISS.
