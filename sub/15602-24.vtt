00:23.135 --> 00:25.011
<i>~ Previously
on "Green Lantern"... ~</i>

00:25.050 --> 00:28.340
I now understand that the best
thing I can do for the Universe

00:28.350 --> 00:29.851
is to eliminate all life.

00:29.869 --> 00:32.287
<i>She's vaporizing
star systems now.</i>

00:32.311 --> 00:35.901
If we can't get her to listen to sense,
we might not have a choice but to...

00:35.925 --> 00:37.832
Do what? Kill her?

00:40.135 --> 00:43.135
Season 1, Episode 24:
<b>"Scarred"</b>

01:07.573 --> 01:10.099
<i>This thing has now become
more dangerous</i>

01:10.138 --> 01:12.706
than the Manhunter and
Anti-Monitor threats combined.

01:12.741 --> 01:16.145
Congratulations, 2814,
you're outdone yourself.

01:16.179 --> 01:19.415
Please. Blame is
irrelevant and unproductive.

01:19.449 --> 01:22.820
We need to find a way
to stop the threat at hand.

01:22.854 --> 01:25.990
Wait a minute.
Didn't the Guardians create Aya?

01:26.024 --> 01:28.455
If anyone knows
how to turn her off, it'd be you.

01:28.502 --> 01:31.963
- "Turn her off?"
- In order to fix her.

01:31.997 --> 01:34.679
<i>We are well aware
of that fact, 2814.</i>

01:34.703 --> 01:37.730
The Guardian who constructed
Aya was our science director.

01:37.765 --> 01:41.877
I believe you stood idly by
while the Anti-Monitor killed her.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.254
What about her records?

01:43.288 --> 01:46.460
Did she leave anything behind
that would allow us to reboot Aya?

01:46.517 --> 01:50.420
It appears the science director
kept no records whatsoever

01:50.450 --> 01:52.784
about Aya or anything else.

01:52.836 --> 01:55.779
Are you sure you looked everywhere,
uncovered every stone?

01:55.814 --> 01:58.894
- We can help with the investigation.
- That will not be necessary.

01:58.925 --> 02:01.786
The Council no longer requires
your assistance in this matter.

02:01.820 --> 02:06.423
You got us into this peril, 2814, but
it will be the Guardians who get us out.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.792
Appa, don't do this.
You're making a huge mistake.

02:08.826 --> 02:10.235
You are dismissed.

02:10.561 --> 02:13.554
- Then it's hopeless.
- Not necessarily.

02:13.570 --> 02:16.519
This isn't the first time the Guardians
have kicked me off an assignment.

02:16.552 --> 02:19.280
- Right, Kilowog?
- Oh, boy.

02:22.667 --> 02:25.270
How do I let you talk me
into these things, Jordan?

02:25.304 --> 02:27.997
Because I'm the best and brightest
recruit you've ever had.

02:28.050 --> 02:30.708
And evidently,
the most delusional.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.407
Act casual.

02:34.879 --> 02:38.365
[whistles]

02:45.836 --> 02:49.067
There it is,
the science director's quarters.

02:49.180 --> 02:51.145
That hole in the wall?

02:51.175 --> 02:53.677
I always thought
that was a bathroom.

02:53.712 --> 02:56.788
I can usually pop a lock
with a credit card.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.238
Usually.

03:01.327 --> 03:03.888
Here, let me try mine.

03:10.365 --> 03:11.566
[grunts]

03:11.600 --> 03:13.601
The Guardians couldn't locate
her records.

03:13.635 --> 03:17.039
What makes you think we'll find them
strewn around her chamber?

03:17.073 --> 03:20.506
One, I hid my Lantern battery
in a smelly locker for years

03:20.526 --> 03:22.147
before my boss
ever found out.

03:22.177 --> 03:24.712
Two, I'm out of ideas.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.416
Look for anything that could help...
Journals, notebooks.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.651
Very cool...

03:38.894 --> 03:41.871
It looks like
an exact model of the system.

03:42.241 --> 03:46.164
Not quite. These planets
are out of alignment.

04:01.619 --> 04:04.127
Thank you, Kilowog's OCD.

04:05.757 --> 04:09.777
[Alarm sounds] <i>Warning. Guardian
quarters have been breached.</i>

04:11.329 --> 04:13.078
Jordan.

04:20.779 --> 04:23.840
What kind of a weirdo builds
a secret underground layer

04:23.875 --> 04:26.282
filled with advanced tech
like this?

04:27.045 --> 04:29.493
Someone who wants
to hide something.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.819
What do you think that is?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.946
Weird. Our Rings are supposed
to translate anything,

04:40.967 --> 04:43.284
but it can't seem
to decipher this.

04:43.308 --> 04:48.324
That's because it's written in ancient
Malthusian, our sacred language.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.807
This isn't exactly
what it looks like.

04:50.849 --> 04:54.947
It looks like you've broken into
a Guardian's personal living space

04:54.955 --> 04:57.190
and discovered a hidden
inner sanctum.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.676
Then I guess it's exactly
what it looks like.

04:59.711 --> 05:02.108
You have done well,
Hal Jordan.

05:02.131 --> 05:05.892
I believe you have discovered
the science director's journal.

05:09.221 --> 05:13.924
Nothing. There is no information
about Aya at all here.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.861
Wait. My Malthusian stinks,
but I can read a map.

05:16.895 --> 05:18.763
These looks like coordinates.

05:18.797 --> 05:22.434
Very astute, Hal Jordan.
That is correct.

05:22.468 --> 05:26.740
But why write it in a language
that almost nobody understands?

05:26.775 --> 05:28.677
What was she hiding?

05:28.744 --> 05:32.062
<i>Do not try to escape.
I know you're down there.</i>

05:34.146 --> 05:37.182
Green Lanterns caught trespassing
into Guardian's living quarters

05:37.216 --> 05:40.118
will be court-martialed
and placed in a science cell.

05:40.153 --> 05:44.470
Prepare to be locked away
for a very, very long time.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.964
Sayd?

05:52.065 --> 05:55.768
We should be looking for Aya,
not rushing to some random location.

05:55.802 --> 05:58.111
We don't even know
what we'll find there.

05:58.142 --> 06:02.711
- I know a clue when I see one.
<i>- Dropping out of ultrawarp now.</i>

06:03.344 --> 06:05.928
<i>Welcome
to the planetoid Vorga.</i>

06:05.974 --> 06:09.603
<i>Would you like me to conduct
a tour of the planetoid Vorga?</i>

06:09.653 --> 06:12.756
<i>There are thousands of sedimentary
rock layers indigenous to...</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:15.966
Lame-o, would you do me
a favor and shut up?

06:16.006 --> 06:18.283
<i>Happy to be of service.</i>

06:29.803 --> 06:32.337
[growls]

06:32.654 --> 06:34.272
[growls]

06:34.307 --> 06:36.908
[all growling]

06:41.428 --> 06:45.873
Wait a minute. Is it me
or are those asteroids moving at us?

06:45.924 --> 06:49.914
It's a tight squeeze, yeah, but
don't worry, I'm a trained professional.

06:57.597 --> 07:01.099
Lame-o, you're supposed
to warn us about hostiles.

07:01.134 --> 07:04.441
<i>Previously you asked me
to shut up.</i>

07:04.471 --> 07:08.030
<i>I successfully executed
your orders.</i>

07:13.479 --> 07:15.360
We need more speed.

07:32.577 --> 07:36.313
<i>Warning. Hostiles
now devouring my tail.</i>

07:36.348 --> 07:39.647
<i>This is contrary
to normal operating parameters.</i>

07:39.648 --> 07:41.506
Got to shake them off.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.516
Or better yet,
take them with me.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.443
How could you know that they would
burn off in the atmosphere?

08:05.477 --> 08:07.445
Instinct, Razer.
Pure instinct.

08:07.479 --> 08:11.441
- Which means he had no clue at all.
- None whatsoever.

08:22.195 --> 08:24.337
<i>Honing in on coordinates.</i>

08:25.199 --> 08:26.720
<i>There!</i>

08:29.603 --> 08:33.996
Stay alert. There's no telling what
other surprises could be out there.

08:51.958 --> 08:54.926
You, in the shadows.
No reason to be afraid.

08:54.958 --> 08:57.763
We're Green Lanterns
sent here on an urgent mission.

08:57.797 --> 09:01.800
- I know who you are.
- You?

09:01.835 --> 09:05.270
- We thought you were dead.
- Not dead...

09:06.164 --> 09:08.767
Merely scarred.

09:12.976 --> 09:14.976
I've been expecting you.

09:15.557 --> 09:19.353
But we saw the Anti-Monitor
blast you into space dust.

09:19.388 --> 09:23.487
Eons ago, the Guardians
possessed tremendous power...

09:23.512 --> 09:25.447
Telepathy, teleportation.

09:25.638 --> 09:28.850
We dared think ourselves
as gods.

09:28.885 --> 09:32.218
But after the great folly that
brought forth the Anti-Monitor,

09:32.250 --> 09:36.450
the Council thought it best
to permanently block our powers.

09:36.478 --> 09:40.182
- But you never did.
- And you should be grateful.

09:40.287 --> 09:45.264
<i>Had I not confronted the Anti-Monitor,
we'd have all been vaporized.</i>

09:47.229 --> 09:49.364
<i>When I knew I was outmatched,</i>

09:49.390 --> 09:54.448
I teleported to this safe haven,
almost unscathed.

09:54.479 --> 09:56.515
Well, once we get back to Oa,
I'm sure they can...

09:56.549 --> 10:00.286
No. The Guardians would not
welcome my return.

10:00.320 --> 10:05.934
Besides, I can do more to stop the
Anti-Monitor unencumbered by the Council.

10:06.555 --> 10:10.430
About that, the good news is
the Anti-Monitor had its head blown off.

10:10.446 --> 10:12.891
- Excellent.
- Yeah.

10:12.914 --> 10:14.934
The bad news is it was
Aya who did it,

10:14.968 --> 10:18.237
right after switching off her emotions
and going bat guano nuts.

10:18.238 --> 10:21.007
And right before
using the Anti-Monitor's body

10:21.041 --> 10:23.510
to start vaporizing
star systems herself.

10:23.544 --> 10:26.646
Do you now finally understand
why you should never

10:26.681 --> 10:29.006
have prevented me
from deactivating her?

10:29.037 --> 10:30.241
I...

10:30.450 --> 10:34.162
- We didn't know what she was capable of.
- Of course not.

10:34.276 --> 10:39.366
How could a mind such as yours anticipate
that which I myself failed to see?

10:39.439 --> 10:43.242
<i>The Guardians tasked me to create
an artificial intelligence</i>

10:43.277 --> 10:47.047
<i>that could understand and
empathize with emotional beings</i>

10:47.078 --> 10:50.451
<i>rather than destroy them,
like the Manhunters.</i>

10:50.485 --> 10:53.549
<i>The challenge was nearly
impossible, even for me.</i>

10:54.222 --> 10:58.890
<i>I devised the most sophisticated
computer ever created.</i>

10:59.121 --> 11:02.137
<i>And yet it was still
only a machine.</i>

11:02.752 --> 11:05.374
<i>It required something more.</i>

11:06.456 --> 11:08.324
<i>I developed a theory.</i>

11:08.358 --> 11:12.225
<i>All that was missing
was the spark of life.</i>

11:20.312 --> 11:21.846
<i>Unbeknownst to anyone,</i>

11:21.881 --> 11:27.452
<i>I extracted a portion of the entity
dwelling inside the Central Battery.</i>

11:27.486 --> 11:31.089
Hold on. There's something
living in the Central Battery?

11:31.471 --> 11:33.905
Few know of its existence.

11:33.962 --> 11:37.997
A creature that embodies
the very essence of willpower

11:38.032 --> 11:41.300
and fuels the entire
Creen Lantern Corps.

11:41.334 --> 11:46.787
<i>I required but a sliver of that being
to complete my experiment.</i>

11:49.953 --> 11:52.088
<i>I was right, of course.</i>

11:52.792 --> 11:57.427
<i>And alas, what you call Aya
was born.</i>

11:57.461 --> 12:00.196
<i>Query.
Is anyone there?</i>

12:00.230 --> 12:06.002
I'm here.
Welcome to existence.

12:06.036 --> 12:08.865
<i>She was an impressive
creation.</i>

12:10.093 --> 12:11.931
<i>But there was a problem.</i>

12:12.060 --> 12:13.919
[Rapid beeping]

12:14.028 --> 12:15.578
What are you doing?

12:15.613 --> 12:19.095
I forbade you to upload data
without my permission.

12:19.142 --> 12:20.907
You will stop immediately.

12:20.946 --> 12:25.115
<i>I require information to understand
the Universe and myself.</i>

12:25.209 --> 12:28.837
I am your Creator.
And I order you to stop.

12:29.103 --> 12:31.999
<i>I have even accessed
your files, Creator.</i>

12:32.038 --> 12:36.343
<i>According to the records, the Guardians
blocked their innate powers eons ago,</i>

12:36.378 --> 12:39.579
<i>yet you never did. Why?</i>

12:39.981 --> 12:43.751
<i>The same spark of life which
allowed her to comprehend emotion</i>

12:43.785 --> 12:47.589
<i>had also developed
curiosity and freewill.</i>

12:47.623 --> 12:50.170
<i>Something had to be done.</i>

12:54.697 --> 12:56.364
Aah!

12:56.399 --> 13:00.014
<i>Negative. I will not allow you
to deactivate me.</i>

13:02.133 --> 13:03.632
Uhh!

13:07.440 --> 13:09.214
Ahh!

13:17.379 --> 13:19.713
<i>I was forced
to wipe her memory,</i>

13:19.748 --> 13:22.949
<i>then blocked her emotions
from her logic processing unit,</i>

13:22.984 --> 13:26.620
<i>rendering her emotional
capabilities inert.</i>

13:26.660 --> 13:28.455
You firewalled her feelings.

13:28.456 --> 13:31.503
And then installed her in the
"Interceptor" as the navcom.

13:31.542 --> 13:34.128
The vessel required
a sophisticated system.

13:34.161 --> 13:37.227
I could not have foreseen
that exposure to your crew

13:37.252 --> 13:40.238
would render my fail-safes
inoperative.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.337
This is good news. You're telling us
that Aya is actually alive.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.393
If her essence came from a living being,
then Aya is a living being.

13:48.489 --> 13:51.825
We can reactivate her emotions,
appeal to her.

13:52.279 --> 13:53.914
It might be possible.

13:53.948 --> 13:58.452
But we would need something to enable us
to get close enough without being killed.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.007
Hey, wait a minute,
that's it.

14:00.043 --> 14:03.881
What's the one thing that
depowers a Green Lantern's Ring?

14:04.287 --> 14:06.908
- Orrum.
- Exactly.

14:06.926 --> 14:09.926
Back on the Spider Guild prison, she
could hardly stand up around the stuff.

14:10.465 --> 14:14.192
Perhaps together we could
construct a warhead.

14:14.235 --> 14:17.556
A bomb? We're not going to kill her.
She's alive.

14:17.578 --> 14:21.246
Of course not. We'll use a missile
to disperse enough orrum

14:21.258 --> 14:23.127
to paralyze her upon impact.

14:23.410 --> 14:26.828
Think of it as a giant tranquilizer dart.
I like it.

14:27.089 --> 14:30.799
Unfortunately, orrum is one of the
rarest elements in this Universe.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.898
It would require an enormous
quantity to confront the A.I.

14:34.933 --> 14:37.868
Lady, this is
your lucky day.

14:54.575 --> 14:56.275
I feel for the kid.

14:56.630 --> 15:00.567
Can't be using building a bomb
to use against the love of your life.

15:00.601 --> 15:03.594
Tranquilizer dart.
Remember?

15:05.836 --> 15:07.776
This is the last batch.

15:10.408 --> 15:11.942
It seems like a lot.

15:12.288 --> 15:15.810
Are you sure this won't
destroy her?

15:15.850 --> 15:20.420
I did not become the science director
of Oa by making miscalculations.

15:20.455 --> 15:23.824
Do you want your Aya back,
or do you not?

15:37.634 --> 15:42.576
The Reconion shell will block the orrum's
effect on both the ship and yourselves.

15:42.611 --> 15:46.180
There's just one last problem.
How do we find her?

15:46.214 --> 15:49.581
That will not be as difficult
as you may believe.

16:00.861 --> 16:02.601
Gnots.

16:14.303 --> 16:16.819
It appears the A.I.
hasn't detected us.

16:16.845 --> 16:20.022
She's focusing solely on
converting that matter to energy.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.449
Let's get this done.
Razer?

16:26.011 --> 16:29.338
Keep her distracted
until we can move into position.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.248
Poor kid.

16:43.595 --> 16:44.905
Aya.

16:48.838 --> 16:52.443
You need to stop, Aya.
You're tearing this system apart.

16:52.478 --> 16:57.013
I am making the Universe a more
stable environment. It is necessary.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.071
Move close enough
to ensure accuracy.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.948
We can't afford to miss.

17:05.223 --> 17:08.961
How can you say this want on destruction
and loss of life is acceptable?

17:08.994 --> 17:11.300
You are operating
under a false assumption

17:11.332 --> 17:14.855
while making an emotional appeal
to a nature I do not possess.

17:14.892 --> 17:18.060
But you do, Aya.
You did care once.

17:18.159 --> 17:20.193
And I know you can again.

17:20.508 --> 17:24.031
I will not reverse my development.
Emotions produce pain.

17:24.101 --> 17:25.747
Pain is undesirable.

17:25.781 --> 17:29.438
Therefore all pain and emotions
should not exist.

17:29.485 --> 17:31.586
Pain lets us know
we are alive.

17:31.621 --> 17:35.557
Your statement proves that life
is an error which must be corrected.

17:35.592 --> 17:38.175
Aya, you need
to know something,

17:38.214 --> 17:40.996
something I learned
about your existence.

17:41.030 --> 17:43.732
Hurry, before she suspects.

17:43.766 --> 17:46.976
Just a few more seconds.
Razer isn't out of blast radius yet.

17:47.002 --> 17:49.215
How unfortunate.

17:51.743 --> 17:54.867
What are you doing?
Razer, get out of there!

18:10.305 --> 18:12.106
You never meant
to stop her.

18:12.137 --> 18:15.076
That missile had enough explosive
to rip a planet in half.

18:15.110 --> 18:17.991
I knew you didn't have
the strength to do what was needed.

18:18.029 --> 18:19.771
Why, you little lyin'...

18:19.803 --> 18:24.887
Spare me of your emotional sanctimony.
Aya is too powerful to exist.

18:24.921 --> 18:27.138
You know this but
would have done nothing.

18:27.201 --> 18:29.636
<i>I have saved countless lives.</i>

18:29.683 --> 18:34.630
- And Razer?
- Inconsequential. A necessary sacrifice.

18:35.132 --> 18:37.301
[grunts]

18:37.350 --> 18:39.382
You dare!

18:42.580 --> 18:44.214
Are you crazy?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.850
[groaning]

18:47.617 --> 18:51.110
You delude yourself.
I am a Guardian.

18:51.145 --> 18:54.873
I am the heir to power, the likes
of which you cannot fathom.

18:54.906 --> 19:00.445
You are a brief candle
upon this plane, a wee mortal.

19:00.479 --> 19:04.384
You know nothing.

19:18.396 --> 19:21.398
[groans]

19:21.433 --> 19:26.398
- You tried to kill me.
- Aya, that was never the plan.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.465
We only hoped to... aah!

19:36.280 --> 19:38.314
[groaning]

19:39.783 --> 19:42.151
Last words?

19:42.186 --> 19:44.340
Brace yourself.

19:46.023 --> 19:47.490
Uhh!

19:47.524 --> 19:48.891
Aah!

19:48.925 --> 19:50.893
[grunts]

20:03.739 --> 20:05.160
We have to get out of here.

20:05.189 --> 20:08.245
On the contrary.
I have to get out of here.

20:12.381 --> 20:15.016
[grunts]

20:15.050 --> 20:17.189
I'm sorry, Aya.

20:18.727 --> 20:21.691
<i>Initiating ultrawarp
protocols.</i>

20:23.092 --> 20:27.185
Soon all organic life
will be less than a memory,

20:27.228 --> 20:29.289
as will you.

20:30.400 --> 20:35.005
<i>You should get to a safe distance.
I can take it from here.</i>

20:36.439 --> 20:38.607
Goodbye, Lanos.

20:45.805 --> 20:47.272
No!

20:55.658 --> 20:57.459
[groans]

20:57.493 --> 20:59.094
What happened?

20:59.128 --> 21:01.763
You killed her! Aah!

21:01.797 --> 21:04.599
[both grunting] No.
No, I didn't.

21:04.633 --> 21:07.101
If that missile didn't kill her,
the ultrawarp won't either.

21:07.136 --> 21:11.606
- All I did was buy us some time.
- Does it matter? We've lost her.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.710
Chin up, kid. All we lost
was the battle, not the war.

21:15.745 --> 21:18.580
Be glad we're alive
to fight another day.

21:18.614 --> 21:20.016
Another day.

21:20.063 --> 21:22.650
If we don't figure out
how to stop Aya soon,

21:22.685 --> 21:26.032
there won't be many
of those left.
