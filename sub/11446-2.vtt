07:50.679 --> 07:52.215
Mister Raymond?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.388
Master Raymond.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.049
How may I have the pleasure...

07:58.186 --> 08:00.177
...of making myself agreeable
to your pretty eyes?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.303
Madonna.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.815
You are English, yes?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.525
My French betrays me.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.582
Go away!

12:41.094 --> 12:42.084
All of you!

12:44.597 --> 12:45.928
Or I will rip...

12:46.182 --> 12:47.297
your balls off!

17:26.295 --> 17:29.128
Gentlemen of noble birth
and noble distinction...

17:29.632 --> 17:30.713
...tonight...

17:31.050 --> 17:33.667
...for your entertainment...

17:33.761 --> 17:36.219
...and edification,

17:37.056 --> 17:39.297
I present you with...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.300
...your wives.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.981
Ladies, if you please.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.483
Naughty!

18:01.789 --> 18:03.245
Zounds!

18:03.332 --> 18:05.243
Such anger...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.621
...such frustration.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.787
And Why?

18:11.299 --> 18:12.334
Because gentlemen,

18:12.633 --> 18:14.340
you are here.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.461
Your wives are lonely.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.261
unhappy-

18:19.807 --> 18:22.469
What they need...

18:23.686 --> 18:24.767
...is...

18:26.480 --> 18:27.766
Dildos!

18:47.293 --> 18:49.455
Take them as gifts...

18:49.629 --> 18:50.869
...from the husbands...

18:50.963 --> 18:52.624
...you need never miss...

18:52.923 --> 18:53.958
...ever again!

18:55.801 --> 18:57.792
Need I say more?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.295
Except to inform you that these items...

19:00.598 --> 19:02.589
...are available in this
very establishment.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.799
For purchase or for rent.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.267
Gentlemen,

19:06.646 --> 19:07.681
I thank you.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.682
Not too late to slit his throat.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.365
Savage of a Turk!

27:46.498 --> 27:47.829
Why can't you be more gentle?

27:48.709 --> 27:51.497
Your discomfort shatters
my soul, Madame.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.327
But feel...

27:54.006 --> 27:54.996
...how smooth.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.291
Yes, yes, like a baby's bottom.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.676
And the worst is yet to come.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.566
And the legs are finished!

30:21.653 --> 30:23.690
Is Madame ready for her next bit...

30:23.822 --> 30:24.812
...of torture?

30:25.449 --> 30:27.156
One moment. Vile monster!

38:19.422 --> 38:20.958
My little savage! It is you!

38:38.066 --> 38:39.397
...allow me to introduce...

38:40.151 --> 38:41.141
...an old friend...

38:46.115 --> 38:47.150
...mywife...

40:01.733 --> 40:02.894
How would you like to meet The King?

40:03.359 --> 40:04.394
Oh, you must.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.850
He's being prepared to
make his grand entrance.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.902
I'm quite friendly with the
Minister of the Royal Household.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.066
It's the perfect opportunity.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.023
It would be quite the honour.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.921
I wouldn't want him to miss that.

40:59.207 --> 41:02.290
And thus some have taken it
upon themselves to ignore...

41:02.752 --> 41:03.787
...Church doctrine...

41:04.295 --> 41:06.377
...and indulge in Lord-knows-what...

41:06.631 --> 41:07.621
...heretical practices.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.964
Then let the Church worry about...

41:10.051 --> 41:11.462
...keeping the people on
the path of righteousness,

41:12.470 --> 41:13.460
and leave The King alone!

41:27.151 --> 41:29.643
Are you blind?
Do you not see how I suffer?

41:39.580 --> 41:40.615
Perhaps if...

41:40.915 --> 41:41.950
...His Majesty...

41:42.166 --> 41:43.156
...would only...

41:43.751 --> 41:44.786
...relax?

41:45.628 --> 41:47.244
Or concentrate.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.669
Bear down and prove himself...

41:48.798 --> 41:49.913
...a master of his bowels.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.505
Has not The King tried
every suggestion...

41:51.634 --> 41:52.669
...known to man?

41:55.096 --> 41:56.803
Nothing works.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.261
I am cursed.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.601
I am Lord Broch Tuarach of Scotland.

42:08.359 --> 42:09.520
Be so kind as to introduce
me to His Majesty.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.184
I beg your pardon.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.860
Do it, if ye wish to relieve
His Majesty's suffering.

42:33.342 --> 42:36.801
Your Majesty, may I present...

42:38.014 --> 42:39.049
...Brack Terack.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.010
Of Scotland.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.051
Your Majesty.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.727
If it pleases His Majesty,

42:46.856 --> 42:48.722
may I suggest he eat only parritch...

42:49.692 --> 42:51.524
...every morning.

42:54.197 --> 42:55.232
Parritch?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.862
Pray tell, what is this parritch
the man clamours about?

43:00.411 --> 43:04.575
I believe he means
"porridge," your Highness.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.042
See that gentleman standing over there?

43:52.213 --> 43:53.248
That's Monsieur Toutine,

43:53.422 --> 43:55.288
better known as L'Andouille.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.465
Dare I ask why?

43:58.136 --> 43:59.217
Because he is proven...

43:59.303 --> 44:02.637
...unable to keep that appendage...

44:02.932 --> 44:06.095
...in his britches
whenever a pretty damsel is within reach.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.811
The latest is Augustine.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.618
Is that the best they can do?

44:32.837 --> 44:34.498
How infelicitous to the ear.

44:34.630 --> 44:35.665
Yes, indeed.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.922
But then, what can one expect...

44:38.009 --> 44:39.170
...from the English?

44:39.510 --> 44:42.252
Theirs is such an unmusical language.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.330
Monsieur Duverney, finally you appear.

45:19.175 --> 45:20.210
God's holy blood,

45:20.301 --> 45:21.712
you sounded exactly like my wife!

45:22.803 --> 45:24.043
My lovely English friend...

45:24.180 --> 45:25.295
...Lady Broch Tuarach...

45:25.681 --> 45:27.137
...the red dress...

45:27.225 --> 45:29.136
...has been most anxious to
make your acquaintance.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.478
The red dress?

45:34.899 --> 45:36.060
Most anxious.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.649
A friend of yours...

45:38.903 --> 45:40.314
...can be nothing less than fascinating.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.562
Where is she?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.697
I believe she means to take the air.

45:45.534 --> 45:46.569
I'll introduce you--

45:48.412 --> 45:50.073
No need to bother yourself, Madame.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.037
I shall manage the introductions.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.631
Your prayers have been...

46:44.635 --> 46:45.625
...answered.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.587
My dear, Monsieur Duverney.

49:33.471 --> 49:34.461
Your King...

49:34.597 --> 49:36.053
...appreciates that you have...

49:36.140 --> 49:37.801
...chosen to follow his edict...

49:38.976 --> 49:40.057
...that the...

49:41.103 --> 49:43.219
...nobles of France familiarize themselves...

49:43.314 --> 49:44.395
...with the pleasures of the bath.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.640
However...

49:47.776 --> 49:48.811
...in the future,

49:48.944 --> 49:50.560
be so good as to
conduct your ablutions...

49:50.654 --> 49:51.644
...in private.

49:56.952 --> 49:58.909
It shall be as His Majesty requests.

50:06.295 --> 50:07.330
Parritch.

50:09.798 --> 50:10.833
On my honour,

50:11.300 --> 50:12.631
you will not regret it.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.960
Cheating coward of a villain!

51:15.406 --> 51:17.363
There will come a time.
