It'll be fun!</i>

00:08.404 --> 00:11.506
<i>- No. It's freezing.
- Great! [Sighs]</i>

00:11.541 --> 00:15.343
Look, nobody else is out
here. It's just you and me.

00:15.378 --> 00:18.079
All right, look, I'm getting in.

00:18.114 --> 00:20.482
- Seriously.
- Go!

00:20.516 --> 00:21.817
Just give me one good
reason why you won't.

00:21.851 --> 00:25.153
- Um... it's cold.
- Okay.

00:25.188 --> 00:26.621
- It's dirty.
- Yeah.

00:26.656 --> 00:30.826
- I don't want to.
- Is that it? That's so boring.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.293
Now, that I like!

00:32.328 --> 00:35.831
That was unexpected.
I like it. That's good.

00:35.865 --> 00:38.700
Come on! Whoo!

00:38.734 --> 00:41.102
<i>Whoa, that's cold!
 Whoo!</i>

00:41.137 --> 00:44.473
Come on!
Yeah, the water's fine!

00:44.507 --> 00:49.878
Cathy! Come on!
 Take a picture!

00:49.912 --> 00:52.547
The water's fine!

00:59.155 --> 01:01.122
[Screams]

01:01.157 --> 01:03.258
<i>- Cathy?
- Oh, my god!</i>

01:03.292 --> 01:05.393
<i>[Screaming]
Cathy, it's okay.</i>

01:05.428 --> 01:08.430
- What's going on?
- Look!

01:12.568 --> 01:14.669
- You need a theme.
- I've got a theme.

01:14.704 --> 01:16.471
- What?
- Booze.

01:16.506 --> 01:20.909
People can drink at home.
You need to... amp up the fun.

01:20.943 --> 01:24.779
- Yeah, like, great music can do that.
- Yeah, get a jukebox.

01:24.814 --> 01:26.281
I got a jukebox in the back.
It's busted, though.

01:26.315 --> 01:28.550
I'm gonna get it fixed.

01:28.584 --> 01:31.286
It's got every tune ever
done by Tiffany on it.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.589
That explains why it's busted.
[Chuckles]

01:34.624 --> 01:36.691
- Maura: You need a theme.
- For a jukebox?

01:36.726 --> 01:38.268
Yeah, Maura's right. And ...

01:38.294 --> 01:39.594
And you know what?
You should switch it up.

01:39.629 --> 01:44.199
Like, one week, do '80s hair bands.
And the next week, do Southern rock.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.735
You know, I think a little
consistency would be better.

01:46.769 --> 01:49.571
Like, all Josh Groban all the time.

01:51.207 --> 01:54.442
I like it. That way, the bar
would be consistently empty.

01:54.477 --> 01:56.244
We would always have seats.
[Telephone ringing]

01:56.279 --> 01:58.380
[Chuckles] The bar will be full.
I'm working on live music.

01:58.414 --> 02:01.468
And you will always have seats.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.919
Detective Kors...
um, uh...

02:03.953 --> 02:05.887
Dirty Robber. This is Vince.

02:05.922 --> 02:10.324
Angela, what do you
think the place needs?

02:10.359 --> 02:13.528
- Yeah, Ma, you're unusually quiet.
- I'm thinking.

02:14.664 --> 02:20.602
- Paging Dr. Isles...
- No, this is a job for two, Dr. Rizzoli.

02:22.371 --> 02:23.538
[Sighs]

02:23.573 --> 02:25.840
What's up, Mom?

02:25.875 --> 02:27.876
- Nothing.
- Mm.

02:27.910 --> 02:30.612
Résumés? 
This about the job hunt?

02:30.646 --> 02:33.949
- Job hunt. How is it going?
- It's not.

02:33.983 --> 02:36.685
Nobody wants to hire a
woman of a certain age.

02:36.719 --> 02:38.720
They want to hire a 22-year-old.

02:38.754 --> 02:42.290
Well, statistically
speaking, that's not true.

02:42.325 --> 02:44.225
Although some jobs do require
more youthful employees,

02:44.260 --> 02:47.495
I think if you just expand your
universe to just ... [clears throat]

02:47.530 --> 02:49.431
Really? Statistics now?

02:49.465 --> 02:53.268
- There's comfort in numbers.
- Not for me.

02:53.302 --> 02:56.938
Résumés sent out ... 37.
Job interviews ... one.

02:56.973 --> 02:59.541
Jobs gotten ... zippo.
[Cellphones ringing]

03:01.043 --> 03:02.677
- Ah.
- Rizzoli.

03:02.712 --> 03:04.546
- Isles.
- Korsak.

03:04.580 --> 03:07.749
- Hey, I got to call you back. Yeah.
- Jane: Do it, yeah. We'll be right there.

03:07.783 --> 03:09.484
Thank you. [Beep]

03:09.518 --> 03:12.387
- I'm sorry. Ma.
- Yeah, okay, forget it.

03:12.421 --> 03:14.656
We'll talk about it later?

03:14.690 --> 03:18.827
Okay, go. Go solve crimes.
I'm staying here.

03:20.396 --> 03:21.896
Hey, Vince.

03:21.931 --> 03:25.367
Gonna stay and hang some
of your posters, okay?

03:25.401 --> 03:26.635
Oh, that's very nice of you, Angela.
Thanks.

03:26.669 --> 03:29.504
Yeah, I'm very generous.

03:29.538 --> 03:31.506
I'm also eating for free.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.508
- Ha.
- Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Korsak.

03:33.542 --> 03:34.876
I'm here about the job.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.444
Oh, you'll just have
to leave your résumé.

03:36.479 --> 03:40.015
We're gonna have to reschedule.
I'm sorry.

03:40.549 --> 03:44.330
- You got any experience?
- Not really. I'm just 22.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.175
You'll be fine.

<b>5x14 - "Foot Loose"</b>

04:09.165 --> 04:10.565
[Seagulls crying]

04:12.568 --> 04:15.804
- Well, this is a first.
- I've seen it once.

04:15.838 --> 04:19.374
Is there anything that you
haven't seen once before?

04:19.408 --> 04:22.410
- You cutting me slack.
- Come on, tell us.

04:22.445 --> 04:24.813
Oh, guy fell off a sailboat.
Probably drunk.

04:24.847 --> 04:28.033
Probably urinating.
When a man stands up to urinate,

04:28.034 --> 04:31.653
his center of gravity is high but the
lifeline to the sailboat deck is low,

04:31.687 --> 04:33.722
so without a hand to steady himself ...

04:33.756 --> 04:36.791
Got it. You... 
Back to your guy.

04:36.826 --> 04:39.594
Yeah, drunk, fell off a boat,
died of a heart attack in the water.

04:39.629 --> 04:42.697
Both feet washed up in a couple of days.
Never found the rest of him.

04:42.732 --> 04:46.601
- So... his feet were detachable?
- Well, everyone's are ... kind of.

04:46.636 --> 04:49.304
The tendons connecting the
foot to the leg are thin,

04:49.338 --> 04:51.406
so they dissolve and
break away in the seawater.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.409
Another reason I hate the ocean.

04:54.443 --> 04:57.679
- What are the other reasons?
- It's full of drunk guys peeing in it ...

04:57.713 --> 04:59.180
I think that's enough.
[chuckles]

04:59.215 --> 05:01.483
Well, the buoyancy of the running shoe

05:01.517 --> 05:04.452
caused the detachable foot
to rise to the surface.

05:04.487 --> 05:06.454
The current would wash
it right to this beach.

05:06.489 --> 05:08.790
So there could be a body on its way.

05:08.824 --> 05:10.859
Yep. 
Got guys in the harbor searching.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.427
They may find it first.

05:12.461 --> 05:16.531
[Sighs] Maura, can you even tell
us anything from just a foot?

05:16.566 --> 05:18.433
I'll be able to tell how
the foot was separated.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.570
- Big fish could do that.
- You've seen that ... once.

05:21.604 --> 05:24.472
- I didn't say "once."
- And once I examine the bones,

05:24.507 --> 05:27.409
I'll be able to check for
damage from the impact of a jump.

05:27.443 --> 05:29.611
Yeah, we'll have Nina check
surveillance cameras on bridges.

05:29.645 --> 05:31.479
Yeah, we'll also check missing persons,

05:31.514 --> 05:33.615
see if somebody went out for
a jog and didn't come back.

05:33.649 --> 05:36.384
- Call us if you find anything.
- All right.

<i>Reporter: Detective Rizzoli.</i>

05:47.997 --> 05:49.731

05:49.765 --> 05:51.800

- Mm-hmm.

05:57.873 --> 05:59.474
[Camera shutter clicking]

06:03.279 --> 06:04.779
What do you got, doc?

06:04.814 --> 06:07.382
Well, based on the
condition of the tissue,

06:07.416 --> 06:09.417
the foot was in the water
for less than 24 hours.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.887
- What about impact damage?
- None. This wasn't a jumper.

06:12.888 --> 06:13.955
- It was sawed off.
- Ugh.

06:13.990 --> 06:15.957
Looks like somebody's doing
a thorough body disposal.

06:15.992 --> 06:17.692
Anything else?

06:17.727 --> 06:21.296
Well, the sneaker is a specialty brand

06:21.330 --> 06:23.398
used by serious runners ...
it has a zero drop.

06:23.432 --> 06:25.533
Wait, wait, wait.
You're losing me.

06:25.568 --> 06:28.269
A zero-millimeter differential
in height from heel to toe,

06:28.304 --> 06:30.038
which provides a wider range of motion,

06:30.072 --> 06:32.540
strengthening the foot,
forcing it to work harder.

06:32.575 --> 06:34.976
Forcing it to work harder?
[Scoffs]

06:35.011 --> 06:38.613
I'll never buy these. 
[Chuckles]

06:38.648 --> 06:40.015
What's that?

06:40.049 --> 06:41.716
Uh, the wear pattern.

06:41.751 --> 06:43.551
- There's more of it on the outside.
- Supination.

06:43.586 --> 06:47.422
The user rolled along
the outside of the foot.

06:47.456 --> 06:49.958
Maybe you can give
a description of the shoe

06:49.992 --> 06:52.861
- to other precincts.
- So if we find other shoes,

06:52.895 --> 06:54.396
- we can compare the wear patterns.
- Yeah.

06:54.430 --> 06:55.930
Well, we've gone over
all the accident reports.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.799
So far, no people ... or feet ...

06:57.833 --> 07:00.835
- have been reported missing.
- I'll keep looking here.

07:00.870 --> 07:03.071
I'll keep looking everywhere else.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.746
Are we playing video operation?

07:11.781 --> 07:13.948
<i>Nina: These are body parts

07:15.718 --> 07:16.751
Ohh. [Groans]

07:16.786 --> 07:19.621
Uh, Jane doesn't like the ocean.

07:19.655 --> 07:23.491
Well, that's not why,
but I'll add it to the list.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.760
I like the ocean, but don't
get me started on lakes.

07:25.795 --> 07:29.097
- Why? Lakes are great.
- There's no current.

07:29.131 --> 07:30.632
Have you ever seen what
settles on the bottom?

07:30.666 --> 07:33.068
Great.
Now you've ruined lakes.

07:33.102 --> 07:34.869
[Sighs]
Nina, is there any connection

07:34.904 --> 07:37.872
between these body parts and our foot?

07:37.907 --> 07:40.608
Not yet.
But take a look at this.

07:40.643 --> 07:42.043
[Computer beeps]

07:42.078 --> 07:44.813
Since 2007, 11 different
feet have washed up in Canada

07:44.847 --> 07:49.350
on the shores of British Colombia.
No one knows why.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.353
So they don't have anything.
Eh, we don't have anything.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.022
<i>Korsak: We've got
a little more than that ...</i>

07:54.056 --> 07:55.657
another body part washed up.

07:55.691 --> 07:57.158
- A foot?
- A torso.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.231
You're gonna need more screens.

08:10.916 --> 08:12.150
<i>Frankie: Thanks, Mr. Pompilio. </i>

08:12.184 --> 08:14.352
<i>Uh, can you get his contact information?</i>

08:16.689 --> 08:19.691
- Anything from the fisherman?
- Yeah, he's a local.

08:19.725 --> 08:21.926
Comes down once a month.
Casts off the pier.

08:21.961 --> 08:24.363
And he saw the torso
wash up, but he didn't see

08:24.364 --> 08:26.765
- where it came from.
- It's illegal to cast off the pier.

08:26.799 --> 08:29.968
He caught us a torso.
Maybe we'll let it slide.

08:30.002 --> 08:31.669
Similar saw markings
to the ones on the foot.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.945
Can you tell if it's the same saw?

08:33.979 --> 08:36.481
No, the blade markings
won't be that specific,

08:36.515 --> 08:39.951
but this is a rough cut
made with a ripping blade.

08:39.985 --> 08:44.822
- Definitely a murder.
- Yeah, we just... don't know why or of who.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.164

09:55.594 --> 09:58.930
- And you don't want to?
- No.

09:58.964 --> 10:03.134
Because you're worried he'll...
find out who you really are

10:03.168 --> 10:08.639
- and see all your flaws?
- Yeah.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.641

a little afraid, too?

10:10.676 --> 10:13.411

- ... till Margaret calls you.

- He was still talking.
- I know! He never listens.

<i>"Qué es laundry?"</i>

10:56.321 --> 10:58.122
[Both laugh]

11:09.401 --> 11:11.636
[Door beeping]

11:11.670 --> 11:14.105
[Sighs]

11:14.139 --> 11:16.240
Yes! Remember these?

11:16.275 --> 11:18.176
Yeah. The thing. 
Volkswagen made them.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.411
You could take the top off,
take the doors off,

11:20.446 --> 11:24.315
- make it different shapes.
- Ah, so cool.

11:24.349 --> 11:26.317
I'll tell you what's uncool ...
it's in my spot.

11:26.651 --> 11:28.519
<i>All right.</i>

11:28.554 --> 11:31.656
Uh...

11:31.690 --> 11:33.257
- Oh, it belongs to Chip.
- The forensic artist?

11:33.292 --> 11:35.560
- Yeah.
- Well, if he gets assigned parking,

11:35.594 --> 11:38.096
I need to call the union.
[Chuckles]

11:38.130 --> 11:39.997
I would so hate to be
Chip right now. [Chuckles]

11:40.032 --> 11:43.034
- Oh, yeah, he's gonna get an earful.
- Yeah, you should tell Chip

11:43.068 --> 11:45.136
<i>to watch where he parks his
thing or he's gonna lose it.</i>

11:45.170 --> 11:48.705
<i>No, the car. It's a ...
N-Never mind.</i>

11:53.318 --> 11:56.887
So, is someone dumping the pieces
one at a time in the harbor

11:56.922 --> 12:00.825
to throw us off time of death,
or is this some sort of statement?

12:00.859 --> 12:04.161
Well, it could be that the parts
were dumped at the same time

12:04.196 --> 12:06.464
and the current is deciding
when they wash up.

12:07.029 --> 12:09.417
Mm.
What do you think about

12:09.418 --> 12:12.503
the psychology of a murderer
who cuts people up with a saw?

12:12.537 --> 12:15.840
Well, it could speak to efficiency.

12:15.874 --> 12:19.577
Mm.
Or he was very good in shop class.

12:19.611 --> 12:20.578
[Chuckles]

12:20.612 --> 12:21.579
[Click]

12:21.613 --> 12:25.716
This is Dr. Isles.
I have finished my external examination.

12:25.751 --> 12:28.319
I'm making a "y" incision on the torso.

12:28.353 --> 12:31.572
Cutting people up like this, it's ...

12:31.573 --> 12:35.800
it's such an odd combination
between passionate and ruthless.

12:35.835 --> 12:38.629
It's, oh, just...
[stammers]

12:39.564 --> 12:41.532
Not you, the murderer.

12:44.903 --> 12:48.205
[Sniffs]

12:48.240 --> 12:49.940
- What?
- Do you smell that?

12:49.975 --> 12:51.976
- That wasn't me.
- Almonds.

12:52.010 --> 12:53.544
Oh. Yeah.

12:53.578 --> 12:56.380
- Get out. Now.
- I told you it wasn't me!

12:56.415 --> 12:59.684
Jane, it's cyanide.
It smells like almonds. [Alarm blaring]

13:05.657 --> 13:09.393
- When do we get our clothes back?
- Exposure was brief,

13:09.428 --> 13:10.895
so decontamination
shouldn't take too long.

13:10.929 --> 13:12.229
[Sighs, coughs]

13:12.264 --> 13:14.532
- Jane?
- What?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.351
- It's just a tickle.
- Let me see.

13:17.836 --> 13:20.671
- What? Stop!
- Jane, cyanide poisoning

13:20.706 --> 13:23.541
stops the cells of the body
from being able to use oxygen.

13:23.575 --> 13:26.544
That didn't happen, and
that thing hurts my eyes,

13:26.578 --> 13:28.946
as it has the last four
times that you've used it.

13:28.980 --> 13:32.249
[Sighs]
Here.

13:33.084 --> 13:36.554
Keep hydrating.
It'll help keep your lungs clear.

13:36.588 --> 13:39.857
I'll breathe better when we catch
"Edward Sawhands."

13:39.891 --> 13:41.592
Mm.
[Computer beeps]

13:41.626 --> 13:45.262
Susie ran a tissue sample today,
and the results just came back.

13:45.297 --> 13:48.466
It confirms that cyanide
was the cause of death.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.802
And the time of death
was 24 to 30 hours ago.

13:51.837 --> 13:54.405
What about the blade marks?
[Keyboard clacking]

13:54.439 --> 13:55.840
[Computer beeps]

13:55.874 --> 13:57.508
It was the same type of
blade on both body parts.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.277
It's a crosscutting blade,
commonly found on a sawzall.

14:00.312 --> 14:02.880
Which you can get in any
hardware store anywhere.

14:02.914 --> 14:04.715
And Susie's gonna test
for cyanide in the foot.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.351
Okay, I'll have Nina check
for large purchases of cyanide.

14:07.386 --> 14:10.321
And in a few hours, the tide comes in.

14:12.591 --> 14:15.559
[Fog horn blows]

14:15.594 --> 14:18.295
<i>[Indistinct conversations]
Coming through.</i>

14:18.330 --> 14:20.536
<i>- Do you mind if I get some more ...
- Excuse me.</i>

14:20.571 --> 14:23.504
Hello?
[Sighs]

14:23.935 --> 14:27.447
Hi. Excuse me. Do you mind
if get another cup of c...

14:28.006 --> 14:32.843
Okay, so my new
superpower is invisibility.

14:32.878 --> 14:35.413
- Okay.
- [Chuckling] What?

14:35.448 --> 14:37.147
No, no.
I-I-I realize that.

14:37.182 --> 14:39.717
No, look, Carlo, I'm gonna
get Karen a big-ass diamond.

14:39.751 --> 14:42.586
That's a given. I'm talking
about the proposal, okay?

14:42.621 --> 14:44.570
I want you to film it for me.

14:45.390 --> 14:49.134
- Can I help you?
- Tell me, what's the plan?

14:49.169 --> 14:50.661
What?

14:50.695 --> 14:53.731
To propose to your girlfriend?
What's the plan?

14:53.765 --> 14:55.332
Uh, I-I don't know.
It's just some lady.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.469
- I-I'm on the phone.
- Hang up. This is important.

14:58.503 --> 14:59.870
Why should I?

14:59.905 --> 15:02.006
Because you're gonna
blow this engagement,

15:02.040 --> 15:05.342
no one is ever gonna love you,
you'll die alone.

15:05.377 --> 15:07.745
I'll call you back.
[Beep]

15:09.581 --> 15:12.817
All right. Tell me.

15:12.851 --> 15:15.553
Okay, well, I-I was thinking
that I wouldn't say a word

15:15.587 --> 15:16.854
but I would deliver the ring

15:16.888 --> 15:20.424
in this weird, like, rube
goldberg-type device with all my bros.

15:20.459 --> 15:23.494
Uh, no, no, I-It'll be great.
It'll be like the Ok Go video.

15:23.528 --> 15:26.797
Okay... No.
[Bottle opens]

15:26.832 --> 15:30.801
- Drink this.
- But I have to go back to work.

15:30.836 --> 15:33.037
They can sell widgets without you.

15:33.071 --> 15:35.039
[Chuckles] I need to
talk to you about women.

15:35.073 --> 15:38.724
'Cause you got a lot to learn.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.452
- What's up?
- Oh. You got your clothes back.

15:48.487 --> 15:50.387
Yeah, I mean, the
scrubs were comfortable.

15:50.422 --> 15:52.490
But every time I got in
an elevator, someone wanted

15:52.491 --> 15:54.558
to tell me about their
rash or their headache.

15:54.593 --> 15:58.395
- And what would you say?
- "Drink some water. Get some sleep."

15:58.430 --> 16:00.664
- You're an excellent doctor.
- Thank you.

16:00.699 --> 16:02.666
Mm. What's this?

16:02.701 --> 16:06.637
- A titanium rod from the torso.
- Murder weapon?

16:06.671 --> 16:08.839
Support for a crumpled spine. 
We'll get to that.

16:08.874 --> 16:12.142
Now, there was cyanide in the
torso, but not in the foot.

16:12.177 --> 16:14.144
So the poison killed him too quickly,

16:14.179 --> 16:16.580
and it got to his heart
before his extremities.

16:16.615 --> 16:18.682
- Excellent supposition.
- Thank you.

16:18.717 --> 16:20.951
- But incorrect.
- Backsies.

16:20.986 --> 16:22.953
- There are no backsies.
- Well, I had my fingers crossed.

16:23.488 --> 16:24.688
Okay.

16:24.723 --> 16:26.957
There were traces of blood
in the foot, "0" positive,

16:26.992 --> 16:28.893
but the blood in the torso was "A."

16:28.927 --> 16:32.530
- So the parts are from different people.
- We've got two victims.

16:32.564 --> 16:35.065
[Sighs]

16:40.130 --> 16:42.131
[Telephone ringing]

16:42.165 --> 16:45.401
<i>Korsak: New paperweight?
Thanks.</i>

16:45.435 --> 16:47.269
It's a titanium rod.

16:47.304 --> 16:49.805
Maura extracted it from
the torso's spinal column.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.274
The victim had
degenerative spine disease.

16:52.309 --> 16:54.610
- There's a serial number on it.
- Which Nina traced.

16:54.644 --> 16:57.079
It was implanted in a Richard o'Connell

16:57.114 --> 16:59.482
- 6 years ago when he was 19.
- Local guy?

16:59.516 --> 17:01.684
Yeah. 
Mom and dad are on their way in.

17:01.718 --> 17:03.619
- Do they know?
- No.

17:03.653 --> 17:06.255
Nina found the leak.

17:10.193 --> 17:11.694
I don't believe it.

17:11.728 --> 17:14.096
[Sighs]
I got to take care of this.

17:14.131 --> 17:17.137
- Go. I'll talk to the victim's parents.
- Thanks.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.278
[Humming]

17:29.312 --> 17:30.513
[Pen scratching]

17:35.819 --> 17:37.432
Hi.

17:37.661 --> 17:40.723
Did I disturb your journey
to another universe?

17:40.757 --> 17:43.592
Actually, it's a heightened
version of our universe.

17:43.627 --> 17:47.396
I call it Bostonia. See?
There's faneuil hall.

17:47.430 --> 17:50.866
- It's a working spacecraft, which I ...
- I didn't come here for the comics, Chip.

17:50.901 --> 17:53.736
Oh. Is this about the parking?

17:53.770 --> 17:55.237
I talked with the
angry-bear guy, Korsak.

17:55.272 --> 17:56.572
You've been leaking
information to the press

17:56.606 --> 17:58.841
about active murder investigations,

17:58.875 --> 18:01.744
which could compromise
those investigations.

18:01.778 --> 18:03.646
I haven't leaked anything.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.683
You sent e-mails from
your work computer.

18:09.853 --> 18:14.156
Oh, right. Yes, I did.
I mentioned some things to my cousin.

18:14.191 --> 18:16.458
He has a local crime blog. 
He put the word out.

18:16.493 --> 18:18.194
That's leaking.

18:18.228 --> 18:21.697
No, it's just talking about
work stuff with a blood relative.

18:21.731 --> 18:25.701
- [Sighs] This is your defense?
- Yeah. So, we good?

18:25.735 --> 18:30.206
No.
And you are so screwed.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.609
The angry-bear guy accepted my apology.

18:33.643 --> 18:37.580
That was parking.
This is leaking.

18:39.603 --> 18:42.438
<i>Jim: He was an amazing athlete.</i>

18:42.472 --> 18:46.142
He was a swimmer, broke
all the high-school records.

18:46.176 --> 18:48.611
<i>Pat: But his back was ... was hurting.</i>

18:48.645 --> 18:53.482
The coach told us that
it was the long season,

18:53.517 --> 18:57.653
so Richie rested.
He took advil by the handful,

18:57.687 --> 19:00.689
<i>stretched, slept on a heating pad.</i>

19:00.724 --> 19:03.192
Nothing helped.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.196
It was a horrible summer.
[Sighs]

19:07.230 --> 19:11.400
After the first workout
of the new season,

19:11.435 --> 19:13.636
we took him to a
specialist at Mass General.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.372
- He had a serious condition.
- Spondylolisthesis.

19:16.406 --> 19:20.076
It's a... a rare spine disease.

19:20.110 --> 19:25.081
[Voice breaking] It's very painful,
and there's no cure.

19:25.115 --> 19:28.084
Must have been very difficult for him.

19:28.118 --> 19:30.186
That's what's amazing ...

19:30.220 --> 19:35.591
he handled the diagnosis
with such... dignity.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.294
He did everything the doctor asked.

19:38.328 --> 19:41.664
- And then he had surgery.
- The titanium rod in his back?

19:41.698 --> 19:45.101
It helped his, uh, posture,
but not the pain.

19:45.135 --> 19:50.106
He never complained,
but it got to him.

19:50.140 --> 19:52.441
We wanted him to have
a second surgery but...

19:52.476 --> 19:53.809
He didn't want to?

19:53.844 --> 19:57.847
He stopped listening
when he found this ...

19:57.881 --> 20:01.250
- this healer.
- Another doctor?

20:01.284 --> 20:04.553
He called himself a doctor,
but he didn't use medicine.

20:04.588 --> 20:06.288
- What did he use?
- I don't know.

20:06.323 --> 20:09.291
Richard got crazy 
when we asked questions.

20:09.326 --> 20:11.694
He stopped taking his medication...

20:11.728 --> 20:15.297
and stopped doing the exercises.

20:15.332 --> 20:18.767
And he got worse.
Much worse.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.637
<i>But he said that we didn't
understand, that we...</i>

20:23.440 --> 20:25.407
... we didn't have faith.

20:25.442 --> 20:27.409
- He thought he would get better?
- He was sure of it.

20:27.444 --> 20:30.146
Mr. o'Connell, what
was the doctor's name?

20:30.180 --> 20:33.382
Murray. Mark Murray.

20:33.416 --> 20:38.120
"Only Dr. Murray understood.
Only Dr. Murray could get him well."

20:38.155 --> 20:41.657
When was the last time you
had contact with your son?

20:41.691 --> 20:44.720
He hadn't returned
our calls for a month.

20:44.755 --> 20:47.690
[Crying]

20:54.538 --> 20:56.172
<i>So, Richard o'Connell gets worse,</i>

20:56.206 --> 20:58.174
<i>but that only makes him
believe in this Dr. Murray more?</i>

20:58.208 --> 21:00.309
- Faith is a powerful thing.
- So is reality.

21:00.344 --> 21:03.563
- What did his surgeon say?
- Well, the titanium rod

21:03.564 --> 21:06.349
stabilized his spine,
but he still had a progressive disease.

21:06.383 --> 21:08.050
- Which would never go away.
- Mnh-mnh.

21:08.085 --> 21:11.254
Well, Dr. Murray promised
a cure, gave him hope.

21:11.288 --> 21:13.122
False hope.

21:13.156 --> 21:14.857
Well, desperate people
take what they can get.

21:14.892 --> 21:18.127
Dr. Murray's license had
been suspended by the A.M.A.

21:18.161 --> 21:19.562
Hmm, can't wait to meet him.

21:19.596 --> 21:24.055
Yeah, I got a bunch of fake problems
he could pretend to help me with.

21:24.090 --> 21:25.626
How long's Murray been
renting this place?

21:25.661 --> 21:27.270
Uh, a little over a year and a half.

21:27.304 --> 21:29.305
<i>Heck of a place for a doctor's office.</i>

21:36.580 --> 21:39.882
Ooh. Well, whoever was manning
the desk left in a hurry.

21:39.917 --> 21:43.152
And they took all the People magazines.

21:43.186 --> 21:46.222
Check with the phone company.
See when the last phone call was placed.

21:46.256 --> 21:47.556
There's something you have to see.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.237
<i>Korsak: Come on around.
Take a look.</i>

22:15.419 --> 22:19.555
Just when I thought I couldn't
be less of a fan of this guy...

22:23.317 --> 22:25.953
At what point
do you think Richard o'Connell

22:25.954 --> 22:26.753
lost faith in his treatment?

22:26.788 --> 22:28.889
When he realized his
doctor was a psychopath.

22:28.923 --> 22:31.158
[Chuckles] If he realized.

22:31.192 --> 22:35.028
I talked to the other tenants.
This place is classy.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.998
We got a guy who buys your grandma's
gold jewelry and melts it down,

22:38.032 --> 22:41.201
we have an earwax-removal specialist
who uses turkish candles,

22:41.235 --> 22:43.270
and we have a woman who rescues cats.

22:43.304 --> 22:44.411
Is that right upstairs?

22:44.412 --> 22:46.073
- 'Cause I heard some awful noises.
- Yeah.

22:46.107 --> 22:48.842
Uh, and apparently, she
rescues them to keep them.

22:48.876 --> 22:50.410
Do they know Dr. Murray?

22:50.445 --> 22:53.980
No. He kept odd hours and
used the entrance out back.

22:54.015 --> 22:57.250
It's a perfect place to
practice imaginary medicine.

22:57.285 --> 22:58.685
[Computer beeps]

22:58.720 --> 23:00.887
[Feedback, electronic warbling]

23:05.460 --> 23:07.761
Oh, come on.

23:07.795 --> 23:11.064
<i>Murray: This is Dr. Mark Murray.
Prepare yourself</i>

23:11.099 --> 23:13.400
<i>to experience the healing
properties of sound.</i>

23:13.434 --> 23:16.403
- [Feedback] Aah!
- One man's wall of sound

23:16.437 --> 23:19.363
- is another man's medical equipment.
- Ugh! [Feedback stops]

23:19.398 --> 23:22.309
Now I need medical help.
[Chuckles] Yeesh.

23:22.343 --> 23:24.177
Hey, what's this?

23:24.212 --> 23:27.914
"Tumors, facial."
"Tumors, lymphatic."

23:27.949 --> 23:29.716
"Joint pain, mild."

23:29.751 --> 23:31.878
He's got a playlist for everything.

23:32.253 --> 23:34.354
I don't want to hear
what went along with that.

23:34.388 --> 23:37.491
Detectives, we found
Dr. Murray's appointment book.

23:37.525 --> 23:39.893
He had a patient coming in ..
Russ Pfeiffer.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.168
Mr. Pfeiffer, how long
were you seeing Dr. Murray?

23:48.202 --> 23:53.406
- Today was my first appointment.
- So you didn't know him?

23:53.441 --> 23:56.877
No. He was going to treat
my rheumatoid arthritis.

23:56.911 --> 23:58.044
Is he okay?

23:58.079 --> 24:01.815
- He was gonna treat you how?
- By using sound waves

24:01.849 --> 24:04.428
to create new pathways
through my neural system.

24:06.454 --> 24:09.289
Mr. Pfeiffer, traditional medicine ...

24:09.323 --> 24:12.325
My traditional doctor
practiced traditional medicine.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.828
He gave me pills ...
anti-inflammatories ...

24:14.862 --> 24:17.364
for years, until my liver
started breaking down.

24:17.398 --> 24:21.001
Then pain pills, which
worked ... too well.

24:21.035 --> 24:24.004
I lived in fear of
becoming addicted to them.

24:24.038 --> 24:27.841
Constant pain or fear of addiction ...
those were my choices.

24:27.875 --> 24:30.661
- How did you hear about Dr. Murray?
- I was on the way home

24:30.662 --> 24:33.980
from the pharmacy
with all of my prescriptions

24:34.015 --> 24:36.850
when I saw this man putting
up fliers on the bus bench

24:36.884 --> 24:40.921
that said "Miraculous healing."
[Scoffs]

24:40.955 --> 24:42.956
You can smile. 
You don't need a miracle, do you?

24:42.990 --> 24:47.427
Uh, Mr. Pfeiffer, I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

24:49.263 --> 24:52.966
I was skeptical, too.
I asked a lot of questions.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.502
The man said he was
Dr. Murray's assistant,

24:55.536 --> 24:58.338
and he told me such
amazing stories of recovery.

24:58.372 --> 25:01.474
He himself was cured of cancer
by Dr. Murray's sound waves.

25:01.509 --> 25:04.945
He looked at the big bag of
pill bottles I was carrying

25:04.979 --> 25:07.514
and told me he used to
have a bag twice the size

25:07.548 --> 25:13.019
and if I saw Dr. Murray, I... 
wouldn't need any pills ever.

25:13.654 --> 25:16.256
And what was his assistant's name?

25:16.290 --> 25:21.328
That's the damndest thing.
I never got his name!

25:21.362 --> 25:22.996
He didn't give you a card or anything?

25:23.030 --> 25:24.531
He referred to himself
as Dr. Murray's assistant.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.545
I never heard him use his own name.

25:29.303 --> 25:31.792
Thank you, Mr. Pfeiffer.
You've been very helpful.

25:31.827 --> 25:34.441
- I can go?
- Yeah.

25:34.475 --> 25:39.280
No, let me do it.
[Sighs]

25:42.884 --> 25:45.002
Mr. Pfeiffer, give us a call if you

25:45.003 --> 25:48.989
- remember anything else.
- Mm. [Door closes]

25:49.023 --> 25:51.024
We need to find that assistant.

25:51.058 --> 25:53.507
Yeah. 
That's the miracle we need.

25:55.062 --> 25:58.031
[Horn honks]

25:58.065 --> 26:00.200
[Indistinct conversations, laughter]

26:06.574 --> 26:09.542
[Click, whirring]

26:09.727 --> 26:11.428
<i>Tony: Uh, excuse me.</i>

26:11.462 --> 26:13.296
I'm looking for my waitress
from this afternoon.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.031
- I didn't get her name.
- Korsak: Was there a problem?

26:15.066 --> 26:17.520
No. She was awesome.

26:18.502 --> 26:22.205
Uh...
I-I brought Clint in to meet her ...

26:22.239 --> 26:24.474
Not, like, for dating.

26:24.508 --> 26:25.742
Uh, I'm about to be engaged.
He's pre-engaged.

26:25.776 --> 26:27.710
- Well, pre-pre-engaged.
- [Chuckles] Hmm.

26:27.745 --> 26:29.746
This waitress just gave
me some really great advice.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.749
- And I need a dose ... a big one.
- Yeah, I thought I was clueless.

26:32.783 --> 26:34.717
[Chuckling]
Well, you are, but I'm ...

26:34.752 --> 26:37.620
- Was it Terry?
- Uh... nope.

26:37.655 --> 26:39.322
- Evelyn? Short red hair?
- I think she was the bartender.

26:39.356 --> 26:41.057
I mean, she was back
there when she told me

26:41.092 --> 26:42.725
I had no idea how to
propose to my girlfriend.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.061
- And I have even less.
- He really does.

26:45.096 --> 26:49.399
Uh, she had dark hair, gravely voice,
pushy, kind of inappropriate.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.134
You're talking about Angela.

26:51.168 --> 26:52.602
- Okay.
- Well, she's not here.

26:52.636 --> 26:54.637
But I'm the owner. 
I know a lot about proposals.

26:54.672 --> 26:58.475
- Um... okay.
- Seriously. I've been married three times.

26:59.509 --> 27:01.478
<i>[whispers] We should go.</i>

27:01.512 --> 27:03.279
Yeah. It's ... It's getting late, so...

27:03.314 --> 27:05.615
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:06.784 --> 27:09.619
- He should talk to Angela.
- Definitely.

27:09.653 --> 27:13.089
Blood from both the foot and the torso
were present at the crime scene.

27:13.124 --> 27:14.757
Which doesn't mean they
were murdered there.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.494
Uh, no, but they were
definitely cut up there.

27:17.528 --> 27:20.497
Jane. We got to go.
[Sighs]

27:20.681 --> 27:22.749
Dr. Murray was kicked out of the A.M.A.,

27:22.783 --> 27:25.518
but Nina found a bogus
license he filed with the city

27:25.552 --> 27:27.387
when he rented his office.

27:27.421 --> 27:30.140
It lists information on the assistant.
His name is Bob Burke.

27:30.141 --> 27:32.759
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- That's why we got to hurry.

27:32.793 --> 27:34.527
An emergency call for
Bob Burke just came in.

27:34.561 --> 27:36.696
And the paramedics are
already on their way.

27:39.033 --> 27:42.001
<i>I heard a noise, so I
came out on the porch.</i>

27:42.036 --> 27:45.672
I saw Mr. Burke stumbling
out of his apartment.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.940
He fell to his knees,
vomited, and passed out.

27:47.975 --> 27:52.679
- That's when I called 911.
- You did the right thing.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.682
I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
Um, can I ask him a few questions?

27:55.716 --> 27:58.418
- As long as I can keep working on him.
- Absolutely.

27:58.452 --> 28:00.787
Uh, M-Mr. Burke,
I need to ask you a couple

28:00.788 --> 28:02.755
questions about Dr. Murray.
Y-You worked for him?

28:02.790 --> 28:04.624
[Weakly] I idolized him.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.993
He was [breathes shakily]
a visionary.

28:07.027 --> 28:10.963
- He was also your doctor?
- He saved my life.

28:10.998 --> 28:16.302
- But... t-then he...
- Then what?

28:16.337 --> 28:18.705
M-M-Mr. Burke, please tell me.

28:18.739 --> 28:24.944
He began to believe
that he was above men...

28:24.978 --> 28:28.581
- like a god. [air hisses]
- What's wrong with him?

28:28.615 --> 28:33.019
- We're working on that.
- [Sniffs] Almonds.

28:33.053 --> 28:35.722
- What?
- He's been poisoned by cyanide.

28:35.756 --> 28:36.723
<i>Everybody get back!</i>

28:36.757 --> 28:38.823
[Breathing raggedly]

28:46.281 --> 28:47.782
<i>All right. She's here. </i>

28:47.816 --> 28:49.817
- Dr. Isles.
- Dr. Rizzoli.

28:49.851 --> 28:52.753
- Dr. Rizzoli.
- Mm-hmm.

28:55.290 --> 28:57.691
- He's actually a nurse.
- [Chuckles] That's ...

28:57.726 --> 28:59.674
Why do you have to be that way?

28:59.811 --> 29:02.680
She's the one who's
disinfecting our clothes.

29:02.714 --> 29:04.215
Oh, go talk to your smiley girlfriend.

29:04.249 --> 29:05.716
Maybe she's got a thing for nurses.

29:05.751 --> 29:07.785
Yeah, and tell her that she
can solve all of her problems

29:07.819 --> 29:10.688
by drinking lots of water
and getting tons of sleep.

29:10.722 --> 29:12.323
No, he can't say that.
He's not a doctor.

29:12.357 --> 29:15.326
- I want my clothes back.
- Tomorrow.

29:17.128 --> 29:19.764
- You good?
- I'm good. [Sighs]

29:19.798 --> 29:21.799
I'm saving a ton on dry-cleaning so...

29:21.833 --> 29:23.401
Your clothes are in
the back of my trunk.

29:23.435 --> 29:26.070
- [Stammers] What about Frankie's?
- Yep.

29:26.104 --> 29:27.338
Mm. [Chortles]

29:27.372 --> 29:28.739
Thanks for bringing them.

29:28.774 --> 29:30.207
[Woman laughs]

29:30.242 --> 29:33.210
Oh, I guess she likes a man in uniform.

29:33.245 --> 29:36.447
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, wait.

29:36.481 --> 29:38.115
Seriously, you do need
to flush out your system.

29:38.150 --> 29:41.719
- With alcohol.
- Exactly. Excuse me.

29:41.753 --> 29:44.055
May we get some service
for the doctor, please?

29:44.089 --> 29:46.690
We got a surgery in an hour.

29:50.562 --> 29:53.798
[Monitor beeping]

29:53.832 --> 29:58.069
He's weak, but when he
wakes up, he could talk.

29:58.103 --> 30:01.105
- Thank you, doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

30:07.379 --> 30:08.779
[Sighs]

30:15.654 --> 30:17.796
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:17.831 --> 30:20.524
- Uh, Detective Jane Rizzoli.
- I remember.

30:20.559 --> 30:21.826
Thank you. [Sighs]

30:21.860 --> 30:25.830
- Um [sighs] Mr. Burke...
- Bob.

30:25.864 --> 30:28.699
Okay, Bob, um...

30:28.734 --> 30:31.893
Can you tell me about Dr. Murray?

30:33.405 --> 30:38.109
He used sound waves to push
my cancer into remission.

30:38.143 --> 30:45.416
My oncologist didn't believe it,
but the tests showed it was gone.

30:45.450 --> 30:48.385
I quit my job as an accountant
to work for Dr. Murray.

30:48.420 --> 30:50.354
You were his assistant.

30:50.388 --> 30:54.525
I did everything.
I answered phones, handled billing.

30:54.559 --> 30:56.193
Um, did you help with the treatments?

30:56.228 --> 31:00.531
He put patients in specific
acoustical environments

31:00.565 --> 31:02.800
that he designed himself.

31:02.834 --> 31:06.137
Uh, I adjusted the levels
during the procedure.

31:06.171 --> 31:09.406
- And what were the results?
- I saw miracles ...

31:09.441 --> 31:15.346
arthritis just... gone,
scoliosis straightened.

31:15.380 --> 31:18.249
Tumors disappeared.

31:18.283 --> 31:22.386
But... then...

31:22.420 --> 31:24.822
What? Then what?

31:24.856 --> 31:28.425
I was an accountant,
so I knew spreadsheets.

31:28.460 --> 31:31.162
I catalogued Dr. Murray's
treatment protocol.

31:31.196 --> 31:33.430
Dr. Murray was obsessed with data.

31:33.465 --> 31:37.168
He wanted to prove to the medical
community that they were wrong,

31:37.202 --> 31:41.172
That he had the answer
to curing all disease...

31:41.206 --> 31:42.306
with sound.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.542
<i>I know. I know.</i>

31:44.576 --> 31:48.412
It seems crazy, but that's
what I saw happening.

31:48.446 --> 31:52.216
- Everyone got better.
- But then someone didn't.

31:53.485 --> 31:57.918
Two patients didn't respond at all...

31:58.623 --> 32:03.961
- And Dr. Murray went a little... crazy.
- How crazy?

32:06.231 --> 32:10.601
[Voice breaking] He killed them
so the world wouldn't know he failed,

32:10.635 --> 32:14.638
<i>and when I wouldn't help
him cover up the murders,</i>

32:14.673 --> 32:17.508
<i>he came to my apartment and
held me down... [monitor beeping]</i>

32:17.542 --> 32:20.377
... and poured a vial
of cyanide down my throat!

32:20.412 --> 32:22.780
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to leave.

32:22.814 --> 32:24.481
<i>He's gonna come back.</i>

32:24.516 --> 32:26.483
I'm the only one who knows!
He's gonna come back!

32:26.518 --> 32:28.719
No, you're safe here, okay? 
I promise.

32:28.753 --> 32:30.254
<i>I promise.</i>

32:30.288 --> 32:33.357
No shots! 
I will not have any shots!

32:33.391 --> 32:35.893
[Sobbing]

32:35.927 --> 32:37.561
Hey, Frankie.

32:37.596 --> 32:40.731
Hey, Jane. I found a home
address for Dr. Murray.

32:40.765 --> 32:42.466
Okay, great. 
Um, text me the address.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.269
I'll be there as soon as I
can get a guard on this door.

32:45.903 --> 32:48.806
I don't expect there'll
be any permanent damage

32:48.840 --> 32:50.541
from the cyanide.

32:50.575 --> 32:52.409
Uh, Mr. Burke experienced a
significant amount of vomiting,

32:52.444 --> 32:54.511
which limited the amount
of poison in his system.

32:54.546 --> 32:56.513
Well, I'd like to see the
results of his tox screen

32:56.548 --> 32:58.515
so I can compare it to what
I found in the two victims.

32:58.550 --> 33:02.653
- I'd love to help, but I can't.
- I could get a search warrant.

33:02.687 --> 33:06.557
- [Sighs] We didn't do a tox screen.
- That's standard procedure.

33:06.591 --> 33:10.394
It is, but Mr. Burke is vehemently
against Western medicine ...

33:10.428 --> 33:11.929
no needles, no tests.

33:11.963 --> 33:14.398
And since he was
conscious when admitted,

33:14.432 --> 33:16.867
we had to ask for his consent, 
which was denied.

33:16.902 --> 33:19.470
Then there's no way to
determine his toxicity levels.

33:19.504 --> 33:23.307
- Is he aware of how dangerous cyanide is?
- Oh, he's aware.

33:23.341 --> 33:26.677
Oh, and against my advice,
Mr. Burke's demanding his release.

33:29.714 --> 33:30.948
[Beep]

33:30.982 --> 33:33.284
[Ringing]

33:33.318 --> 33:37.074
Susie. Grab a collection kit.

33:44.462 --> 33:47.298
- Hey, Korsak.
- Korsak: Yo?

33:47.332 --> 33:48.866
Look at this.

33:51.903 --> 33:53.871
Nice boat.

33:53.905 --> 33:56.740
Yeah, perfect for dumping
body parts in the harbor.

33:56.775 --> 33:59.710
But who's doing the dumping?

33:59.744 --> 34:02.107
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

34:06.818 --> 34:08.686
[Cellphone vibrates]

34:10.688 --> 34:14.058
- [Beep] Dr. Isles.
- Jane: Hi. It's me.

34:14.092 --> 34:15.793
Can you send me a photo

34:15.827 --> 34:17.393
of the wear pattern on the
bottom of the running shoe

34:17.429 --> 34:19.763
- that washed up in the harbor?
- Yep.

34:19.797 --> 34:22.065
<i>Send it to Korsak's phone.</i>

34:22.100 --> 34:23.667
[Computer beeps]

34:23.702 --> 34:25.536
Uh, the sneaker showed
pronounced supination

34:25.570 --> 34:27.471
in the wear pattern.

34:27.505 --> 34:29.005
Right, and the outside
edges were worn down.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.040
<i>Yes, it was a specialty
running shoe made by Altra.</i>

34:32.643 --> 34:34.545
Wear patterns match.

34:34.579 --> 34:37.047
Yep. Same manufacturer.
It's also zero drop.

34:37.081 --> 34:39.683
<i>Um, I'm gonna have CSRU come in here</i>

34:39.717 --> 34:41.018
and bag the shoes and
dust the apartment.

34:41.052 --> 34:42.820
Wait, Jane. There's something else.

34:42.853 --> 34:45.789
Bob Burke wouldn't allow the
hospital to run any blood tests,

34:45.824 --> 34:48.609
so I sent Susie over to his
apartment, and she managed

34:48.610 --> 34:51.395
to get some samples off the
welcome mat where he vomited.

34:51.429 --> 34:54.031
- Okay.
- There was no trace of cyanide.

34:54.065 --> 34:56.033
It had to come out, or he'd be dead.

34:56.067 --> 34:57.634
No, no, no, he ... he reeked of it.

34:57.669 --> 34:59.536
I smelled it.
The paramedic smelled it.

34:59.571 --> 35:01.505
No, he reeked of almonds

35:01.539 --> 35:03.774
because his discharge was
laced with almond extract.

35:03.808 --> 35:06.777
He probably swallowed enough
to make himself throw up.

35:06.811 --> 35:09.380
And to make us think he'd been poisoned.

35:09.414 --> 35:10.514
All right. Thanks.

35:10.548 --> 35:12.649
- Burke played us.
- Yep.

35:12.684 --> 35:16.387
- We can't let him leave the hospital.
- Harrington's guarding Burke.

35:16.421 --> 35:19.690
That's Dr. Murray at
the bottom of the harbor.

35:19.724 --> 35:22.993
- Harrington's not answering.
- Frankie.

35:23.028 --> 35:25.796
Get everybody to the hospital.
Bob Burke's our killer.

35:29.515 --> 35:30.816
<i>Excuse me. </i>

36:00.846 --> 36:03.348
[Muffled shouting]

36:03.382 --> 36:04.983
He looked so sick.

36:05.017 --> 36:06.851
I didn't think he had enough
strength to overpower me.

36:06.886 --> 36:08.086
- Okay. You all right?
- I'm pissed!

36:08.120 --> 36:09.387
Yeah, me too.

36:11.757 --> 36:15.226
Jane.
Burke's gone.

36:15.261 --> 36:17.128
He's got Harrington's uniform.

36:17.163 --> 36:19.464
Lock down the hospital.
We're on our way.

36:19.498 --> 36:23.068
No one leaves without my authorization.

36:23.102 --> 36:25.604
Riley. Brown. Come on.

36:25.638 --> 36:28.206
Detective Rizzoli,
how long will this take?

36:28.240 --> 36:30.342
As long as it takes to
make sure everyone's safe

36:30.376 --> 36:31.910
and to bring Burke into custody.

36:31.944 --> 36:35.614
Now, we have to lock down the
entire hospital floor by floor.

36:35.648 --> 36:38.350
As my men arrive, they'll
replace hospital security, okay?

36:38.384 --> 36:40.485
I promise we'll get it
done as quickly as possible.

36:40.519 --> 36:42.320
Come on.

36:42.355 --> 36:45.056
Uh, so, I need you at the back
exit near the loading dock.

36:47.893 --> 36:51.029
Detective Rizzoli ordered
me to sweep the parking lot.

36:56.602 --> 36:58.203
Yeah, we're almost there.
What's the word?

36:58.237 --> 36:59.571
First two floors are clear.

36:59.605 --> 37:01.406
Okay, don't forget to
check the janitor's closets.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.174
- And the air vents.
- And the air vents.

37:03.209 --> 37:05.010
He's not going anywhere.

37:36.008 --> 37:37.242
You know what's in here?

37:37.276 --> 37:39.310
Almond extract.
Goes great with cookies.

37:39.345 --> 37:42.147
- You sure about that?
- Absolutely.

37:42.181 --> 37:44.115
I love a good almond cookie.

37:44.150 --> 37:46.651
Stop.

Put your hands on the wheel.

38:08.506 --> 38:12.210
You're under arrest for the
murder of Dr. Mark Murray

38:12.244 --> 38:13.478
and Richard o'Connell.

38:13.512 --> 38:16.748
<i>Got him. [Static]</i>

38:22.488 --> 38:24.723
Jane: Bob was obsessed with Dr. Murray

38:24.757 --> 38:27.225
and the idea that he
found some miracle cure.

38:27.259 --> 38:29.094
And I went through Burke's charts.

38:29.128 --> 38:33.098
The cures that they were
experiencing were temporary.

38:33.132 --> 38:35.517
So they felt better
because they believed

38:35.518 --> 38:38.036
- they were getting better.
- Exactly. The placebo effect.

38:38.070 --> 38:40.371
But eventually, the illnesses
reasserted themselves.

38:40.406 --> 38:43.641
After a year's worth of data,
he knew the experiment had failed.

38:43.676 --> 38:46.511
- He wanted to close up shop.
- Bob wouldn't let him.

38:46.545 --> 38:49.047
Well, why did he kill the other guy?

38:49.081 --> 38:52.317
Richard o'Connell realized he
wasn't getting better with sound.

38:52.351 --> 38:54.586
Uh, he filed a complaint with
the Attorney General's office.

38:54.620 --> 38:58.523
- They opened an investigation.
- It's just all so sad.

38:58.557 --> 39:00.658
But I got to tell you,

39:00.693 --> 39:03.461
sometimes faith is the only
way we get through things.

39:03.496 --> 39:06.564
Yeah, but, Ma, 
it can't be the only thing.

39:06.599 --> 39:10.168
No.

Yeah, she could be the

39:31.624 --> 39:34.359

- Actually, she is the current Mrs. Rizzoli,

39:34.393 --> 39:37.609
