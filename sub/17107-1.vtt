TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy--"

00:04.480 --> 00:05.759
-Don't take no for
an answer then.

00:05.799 --> 00:07.639
We can ask Ms. Raine if you
can repeat third year.

00:11.279 --> 00:15.199
-Sammy died on the
way to hospital.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.320
-The committee said
I could choose any

00:17.359 --> 00:19.039
school in the world.

00:19.079 --> 00:21.359
I choose the Academy.

00:21.399 --> 00:22.800
-Because we're going to be
good for each other.

00:22.839 --> 00:24.600
And eventually, you'll
be ready to see it.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.320
-I'll be back, I promise--

00:27.359 --> 00:29.320
for third year.

00:29.359 --> 00:31.399
-Everything's wrong
without you.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.399
We're all going to fall apart.

00:33.439 --> 00:37.799
-No you won't, because you're
going to be the glue.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.359
[theme music]

00:45.840 --> 00:49.320
THEME SONG: Woah-oh, oh-oh.

00:49.359 --> 00:51.759
Woah oh oh.

00:51.799 --> 00:58.719
Take a breath, closer
your eyes.

00:58.759 --> 01:03.719
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:06.719 --> 01:08.680
This is my chance.

01:08.719 --> 01:14.239
This is my chance-- my
chance to feel alive.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.239
Woah-oh, oh-oh.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.680
Woah oh oh.

01:34.599 --> 01:37.319
-Ladies and gentlemen, I am
honored to welcome you to the

01:37.359 --> 01:41.480
official opening of the Samuel
Lieberman Memorial Studio.

01:41.519 --> 01:44.560
I'd like to introduce former
student and Sammy's close

01:44.599 --> 01:48.280
friend Tara Webster to make
the commencement speech.

01:48.319 --> 01:54.599
[applause]

02:03.480 --> 02:06.640
-The irony is, out of all of
us, Sammy is the one you'd

02:06.680 --> 02:08.240
want making this
sort of speech.

02:08.280 --> 02:13.039
Because he truly got the bigger
picture, that dance

02:13.080 --> 02:15.800
shouldn't be about chasing
accolades or--

02:15.840 --> 02:17.159
or even perfection.

02:19.479 --> 02:20.639
It's about bringing
people together.

02:23.479 --> 02:26.800
I've been thinking a lot about
that since I left the academy.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.599
And I know in third year, we
missed his Sammy-esque

02:29.639 --> 02:30.800
wisdom every day.

02:41.879 --> 02:44.159
It was easy to lose perspective,
because there was

02:44.199 --> 02:47.039
this one thought playing
over and over.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.479
This is the rest of your life.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.680
-And smooth transition--

02:55.719 --> 02:56.840
good you two.

02:56.879 --> 02:57.840
TARA NARRATING: You'd
trade both arms for

02:57.879 --> 02:59.639
that company contract.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.080
And now, we were so close, we
were petrified it could slip

03:03.120 --> 03:04.280
right through our fingers.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.800
The company was always
watching.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.520
So every moment was a potential
audition, a 12-month

03:20.560 --> 03:21.719
race to the finish line.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.479
And the people who knew us
better than anyone else on the

03:28.520 --> 03:32.159
planet, our best friends, well,
they were now meant to

03:32.199 --> 03:33.360
be the enemy.

03:37.199 --> 03:39.639
-Thank you, Zachary.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.360
When's the best time for us
to pop back in again?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.560
-Well, it just so happens we
have our first assessments for

03:44.599 --> 03:46.400
the year on Friday.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.400
-I adore assessments.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.039
Let's move them to
the theater.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.560
-Sure.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.800
-Bye, Sir Geoffrey.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.199
Thank you.

03:57.439 --> 03:59.639
-Have a heart, we're
dying here.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.039
-All right, some space has
temporarily opened up in the

04:03.080 --> 04:04.560
court of ballet.

04:04.599 --> 04:07.159
So the company are considering
taking some third years in for

04:07.199 --> 04:09.599
the rest of the Sydney season.

04:09.639 --> 04:10.639
-How much space are
we talking?

04:10.680 --> 04:11.639
-What type of dancers
do they need?

04:11.680 --> 04:12.599
-Girls, boys?

04:12.639 --> 04:13.960
-Ben can do drag.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.800
-I don't know, and I don't want
this to derail you, OK?

04:15.840 --> 04:19.120
Getting a fill-in role does
not guarantee anybody a

04:19.160 --> 04:20.600
contract at the end
of the year.

04:20.639 --> 04:23.480
-No, it would have absolutely
no effect on it whatsoever.

04:23.519 --> 04:24.839
-Come on, let's go from
the top of the

04:24.879 --> 04:27.160
second pas de deux--

04:27.199 --> 04:28.319
be ready.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.040
-Not now, Katrina.

04:30.079 --> 04:32.800
-I've got 75% in classical
and 78% in contemporary.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.319
I'm officially a late bloomer.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.199
It does make you think a whole
lot of time was squandered

04:37.240 --> 04:40.199
last year and the ones
before that.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.319
-You don't say.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.600
-I do say.

04:42.639 --> 04:45.279
And I also say, neither of
us are getting younger.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.720
So what's stopping me from
finishing second year by the

04:47.759 --> 04:49.800
end of the semester and
transferring straight into

04:49.839 --> 04:50.920
third year?

04:50.959 --> 04:54.040
I could graduate on the
original timeline.

04:54.079 --> 04:55.639
-You want to accelerate
two years of academy

04:55.680 --> 04:57.639
training into one.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.360
-Well, it's going to take
some effort, but--

04:59.399 --> 05:01.319
-These are week two
results, Katrina.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.120
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.160
-It's an insult they're
making me audition.

05:06.199 --> 05:09.120
I was the best in third
year last year.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.759
-Hot tip-- maybe, if you spent
less time checking out your

05:11.800 --> 05:14.160
man muscles, you might have
gotten a contract the first

05:14.199 --> 05:15.319
time around.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.480
-I guess that's the beauty
of a surprise party.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.759
We cancel, and Abigail will
never know the difference.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.160
-No, it's still her birthday.

05:23.199 --> 05:24.480
Sorry, but this changes
nothing.

05:24.519 --> 05:26.680
-You know, I love parties
I'm basically a

05:26.720 --> 05:28.279
party in human form.

05:28.319 --> 05:30.279
But this week just became
about rehearsals.

05:30.319 --> 05:31.639
-It's pas de deux, guys.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.160
We dance together, yeah?

05:33.199 --> 05:34.399
It's not a solo--

05:36.560 --> 05:37.720
next group.

05:40.279 --> 05:42.360
Listen guys, we're up against
the last day of re-enrollment.

05:42.399 --> 05:44.519
Have any of you heard
anything?

05:44.560 --> 05:45.560
-He just--

05:45.600 --> 05:47.199
I think he just needs
some more time.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.399
-You got through to Christian?

05:48.439 --> 05:49.439
-I feel so rejected.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.639
My texts keep falling
into the void.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.279
-Look, I don't know how
much longer I can

05:53.319 --> 05:54.720
keep Ms. Raine off.

05:54.759 --> 05:56.800
But as soon as he checks in, you
get him to call me please.

06:02.680 --> 06:03.319
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Do you want to take

06:03.360 --> 06:04.480
that back to my office?

06:04.519 --> 06:06.720
-I think it's a bridge-building
kind of day.

06:10.639 --> 06:11.399
-They're doing "Giselle." So.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.639
-I thought it was "Dipiana."

06:12.680 --> 06:14.720
-"Dipiana," then "Giselle."
Everyone shut up.

06:14.759 --> 06:17.360
We're commencing speculation
with Dr. Wicks.

06:17.399 --> 06:18.720
She has five appointments
today with

06:18.759 --> 06:20.319
injured company dancers.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.319
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Well,
I know Tim's in for

06:21.360 --> 06:22.560
groin strain.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.040
-And I'm way more of a Tim
type than you, so--

06:24.079 --> 06:26.160
-Wait, you stole her
appointment list?

06:26.199 --> 06:28.600
-We should also keep in mind
factors other than injury.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.319
-Ah, that core girl with the
wonky eye-- always crying.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.199
-Eloise-- her dad's sick.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.399
-Eloise is pushing 5'8".

06:34.439 --> 06:37.199
You're a garden gnome
by comparison.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.319
-He's right, Tara's probably
more a contender there.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.319
-Stop it, you're not
even in third year.

06:41.360 --> 06:46.800
-Way to rub it in, although
I do love you.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.399
-This isn't what this year
should be about.

06:49.439 --> 06:51.079
-Sorry, who thinks it shouldn't
be about getting a

06:51.120 --> 06:52.279
potential spot in the company?

06:56.279 --> 07:00.680
-Darling, when did you
become the image of

07:00.720 --> 07:03.079
your heavenly mother?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.639
How is she?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.360
Any chance of me luring
her back?

07:07.399 --> 07:10.600
-Oh, you know mom loves
to be courted.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.399
I heard you were looking
for third years

07:12.439 --> 07:13.839
to beef up the core.

07:13.879 --> 07:16.839
-In my day, the core danced
through injuries.

07:16.879 --> 07:19.639
Everything's so PC now.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.199
-Well, I was wondering, just for
the experience, if maybe I

07:23.240 --> 07:24.800
could be considered as well.

07:24.839 --> 07:29.240
I don't have a partner, but I
could dazzle you with a solo.

07:29.279 --> 07:30.800
-I do enjoy a good dazzling.

07:33.639 --> 07:36.160
-See you.

07:36.199 --> 07:39.800
-A one, two, three, four--
eyes front, Lily.

07:39.839 --> 07:40.839
You're playing ballet bots.

07:40.879 --> 07:42.240
Come on, this is for Abigail.

07:44.519 --> 07:46.040
-I'm in studio six when
you're ready.

07:46.079 --> 07:47.439
-Ah, negatory, Benster--

07:47.480 --> 07:49.199
I know you want her all to
your yourself, but she's

07:49.240 --> 07:50.199
coaching me next.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.720
-I don't want her
all to myself.

07:51.759 --> 07:54.600
-Good, I wouldn't want our no
boy pact to be infringed upon.

07:54.639 --> 07:55.560
-The two of you?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.240
Yeah, that's never
going to happen.

07:58.279 --> 08:00.480
-And that's a pile-up.

08:00.519 --> 08:02.639
-So we're running a fraction
behind schedule.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.639
It would probably go faster with
some of your expertise.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.839
-No, as partner,
I have rights.

08:07.879 --> 08:09.639
And my vote is no
tribute dance.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.600
Look, the line's drawn.

08:10.639 --> 08:11.920
My foot's down.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.160
-But then it'll be just another
party, and it has to

08:14.199 --> 08:15.079
be unforgettable.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.480
-Why, T?

08:16.519 --> 08:18.199
Abigail doesn't even
like her birthday.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.600
-She wanted to be a ballet
prodigy, so every year after

08:20.639 --> 08:22.519
10 was just a betrayal.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.439
-It's not just for Abigail.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
It's an ode to friendship.

08:26.519 --> 08:29.079
Tara's saying that even though
we're competing this year for

08:29.120 --> 08:31.680
fill-in positions and company
contracts, we still need to

08:31.720 --> 08:33.320
stay bonded--

08:33.360 --> 08:34.679
I'm guessing.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.080
-That's more or less it.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.639
-All I'm saying is that last
year, you went off and

10:18.679 --> 10:20.519
explored your other
options, which you

10:20.559 --> 10:21.879
couldn't afford to do.

10:21.919 --> 10:24.279
So imagine how I feel with they
partnered me with you.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.440
-I'd go with luckiest
fourth year alive.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.200
-They partner the favorites
with the favorites.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.159
You're clearly not getting
a contract, so therefore,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.039
neither am I.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.799
-It's an interesting
conspiracy theory.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.159
You know what I would give to
dance with someone a little

10:38.200 --> 10:41.600
less egotistical and paranoid?

10:41.639 --> 10:44.120
-I'm egotistical and paranoid?

10:44.159 --> 10:46.039
You're like a celebrity chef
crossed with one of those

10:46.080 --> 10:47.279
miniature dogs--

10:47.320 --> 10:48.600
yap, yap, yap.

10:48.639 --> 10:50.639
-I have no earthly idea how
I possibly could have

10:50.679 --> 10:52.080
gone out with you.

10:52.120 --> 10:55.320
-Ha, likewise--

10:55.360 --> 10:58.679
look, do you think maybe the
reason Sammy went out with

10:58.720 --> 11:02.679
both of us is we're--

11:02.720 --> 11:04.080
-Similar?

11:05.519 --> 11:09.360
Maybe this is just who we are,
and he made us better.

11:20.519 --> 11:22.480
-Abigail, tonight we're still
on for a movie trip?

11:22.519 --> 11:25.759
Remember, "Golden Steps" has
been remastered into 3D.

11:25.799 --> 11:28.159
-I haven't forgotten since the
last time you reminded me.

11:31.279 --> 11:32.200
-You should see the cake.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.759
The likeness is spooky.

11:33.799 --> 11:35.799
-I waited at the beach
for an hour.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.159
Our pre-exam ritual?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.799
-Oh, I totally spaced.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.159
The helium didn't arrive and--

11:41.200 --> 11:42.799
come on, it's been
a hectic week.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.679
I'm relying on you to bring the
calm rays of positivity.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.480
-I'm not your puppy, Tara.

11:46.519 --> 11:48.120
I don't just wag my
tail on command.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.320
-Wonderful--

12:38.360 --> 12:42.120
now who's going to top it?

12:42.159 --> 12:43.039
-Hi--

12:43.080 --> 12:45.559
sorry, sorry, class went over.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.279
-This is a third year
assessment, Katrina.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.200
-And as I'm going to be a third
year in the not too

12:50.240 --> 12:53.240
distant future, I didn't think
it was fair to skip it.

12:53.279 --> 12:55.399
-Please Lucy, can she stay?

12:55.440 --> 12:58.399
I've been dying to see all that
genetic talent in action.

13:08.399 --> 13:14.360
[music playing]

13:46.360 --> 13:48.159
-I'm OK, shall we start again?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.480
-We can't-- third year rules.

13:49.519 --> 13:51.120
-You only get one run
in assessments.

13:51.159 --> 13:53.480
It's to prepare you for
professional performances.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.080
-You were right, we were
under-rehearsed.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.600
-Oh, but the party will
be memorable.

14:00.639 --> 14:04.200
-I'd hate to be a rule breaker
as well, but, ah, would it be

14:04.240 --> 14:08.399
possible to see that last pas
de deux again, Benjamin

14:08.440 --> 14:11.639
dancing with Grace?

14:11.679 --> 14:14.519
-Uh, I don't think I'm
across this one.

14:14.559 --> 14:16.480
-Grace will give it
her best shot.

15:06.679 --> 15:08.639
-Whoops that part
is super tricky.

15:11.879 --> 15:13.639
-All right, then all
we have is Kat.

15:16.639 --> 15:17.840
-But if you feel that dizzy
that you had to skip the

15:17.879 --> 15:18.879
assessment--

15:18.919 --> 15:20.320
-It was just a low blood
sugar moment.

15:20.360 --> 15:24.240
Go, I will handle it with
the guest of honor.

15:24.279 --> 15:29.159
-Tara, hey, what time's
the party?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.039
We all going over together?

15:31.080 --> 15:33.159
-Look, I get you feel guilty or
whatever about last year,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.720
but that was Ben's chance
as well, and

15:34.759 --> 15:35.840
I don't need charity.

15:35.879 --> 15:39.039
-I know, the floor really
was slippery.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.240
-OK.

15:48.679 --> 15:50.600
-Let me say it for you.

15:50.639 --> 15:54.639
There's a simple reason why
I'm behind my friends.

15:54.679 --> 15:55.840
They're all better than me.

15:55.879 --> 15:58.279
-Yes, and second year doesn't
exist to hike

15:58.320 --> 16:00.399
up the school fees.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.320
It may not be in your best
interests to fast-track it.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.360
However, we can decide that
at the end of semester.

16:07.399 --> 16:10.799
I'm prepared to help you reach
your full potential.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.320
-Like extra classes?

16:13.360 --> 16:16.360
-Like one on one, me and you.

16:19.799 --> 16:21.000
-Now?

16:21.039 --> 16:23.240
It's just that we're hosting
this party today.

16:23.279 --> 16:27.200
I had one job to do, and--

16:27.240 --> 16:29.480
nope, fully committed.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.559
-You've always skimmed
over the surface.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.639
That stops now.

16:36.679 --> 16:39.200
Use the mirror.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.519
Think critically--

16:40.559 --> 16:42.840
it's the only way you'll
overcome the deeper flaws.

16:50.639 --> 16:53.080
-Kat's here, she's here.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.279
-OK peeps, Kat's bringing
Abigail so--

16:55.320 --> 16:56.600
hello?

16:56.639 --> 16:57.639
Everyone.

16:57.679 --> 16:58.639
-[whistles]

16:58.679 --> 17:00.039
First positions, you
know what to do.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.240
-Thank you.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.440
-Surprise.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.440
-It's only me, only me.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.799
Great first run though.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.039
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Where is she?

17:15.079 --> 17:15.559
-It's under control.

17:15.598 --> 17:18.200
I delegated it.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.039
-Ollie, handsome, we
need your ETA.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.480
OLLIE (ON PHONE): We're
at the ballet.

17:23.519 --> 17:24.720
-They're at the ballet.

17:24.759 --> 17:25.720
-Ahh.

17:25.759 --> 17:27.559
-That's not the decoy
we arranged.

17:27.598 --> 17:28.358
Are you impaired?

17:28.400 --> 17:29.359
It's the ballet.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.200
You'll never get her
out of there.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.119
-She asked to make a pit-stop.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.480
What did you want me to say?

17:32.519 --> 17:33.160
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Well,
you should have said no.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.200
What are you thinking?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.359
You will never get her
out of there--

17:35.400 --> 17:37.640
-I wanted to thank Sir
Geoffrey just to be

17:37.680 --> 17:39.160
considered.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.119
It almost doesn't matter if I
get the role or not, although

17:42.160 --> 17:45.599
I won't sleep tonight
waiting to find out.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.839
Did you have any feedback
for me, Rebecca?

17:48.880 --> 17:50.200
-Competent--

17:50.240 --> 17:52.039
your musicality was
somewhat forced.

17:52.079 --> 17:54.480
But you've come a long way since
"The Nutcracker." I also

17:54.519 --> 17:56.599
noticed you made significant
breakthroughs last year with

17:56.640 --> 17:58.319
showcase and the musical.

17:58.359 --> 18:00.319
-You saw all of that?

18:00.359 --> 18:04.119
-Mhm, I see everything.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.640
-Do you know if Sir Geoffrey
shares your opinion?

18:06.680 --> 18:07.799
-There are a lot of factors
that play into

18:07.839 --> 18:10.319
his decision making.

18:10.359 --> 18:11.599
-So you're saying I'm--

18:11.640 --> 18:14.240
I'm not getting a fill-in
role even though I

18:14.279 --> 18:15.440
was the best today?

18:18.559 --> 18:20.480
Well, is-- is there anything I
can do to improve my chances

18:20.519 --> 18:22.359
at the end of the year.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.079
-Sir Geoffrey has a list
of who fits his vision.

18:25.119 --> 18:26.440
He starts it when you
enter first year.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.240
And then, he revises
it for injury or

18:28.279 --> 18:30.599
change of body shape.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.160
-Where am I on the list?

18:33.200 --> 18:33.839
-Your legs--

18:33.880 --> 18:35.079
he likes them longer.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.480
-Sorry to interrupt, Rebecca,
but we're running crazy late.

18:45.279 --> 18:46.559
-Thank you.

18:46.599 --> 18:49.599
-And the movie tickets are
nonrefundable, so--

18:49.640 --> 18:51.839
-Let's just get this horrific
party over with.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.119
It's Tara.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.599
Would you expect her
to be subtle?

19:16.599 --> 19:18.319
-Finally, they're pulling up.

19:18.359 --> 19:19.599
-Did you hear that, tributes?

19:19.640 --> 19:21.119
This is not a drill.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.079
-She's here.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.279
She's really here.

19:27.359 --> 19:28.519
-Surprise.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.599
-Does she look like Abigail?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.799
Do you need a photo reference.

19:35.839 --> 19:36.480
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
An hour late?

19:36.519 --> 19:37.119
It's not fashionable.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.319
It's rude.

19:40.359 --> 19:41.480
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Su-- oh, wait, look.

19:41.519 --> 19:43.400
-Su-- su-- surprise.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.359
-Surprise.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.319
-I can't believe it.

19:47.359 --> 19:48.480
Is this all for me?

19:52.799 --> 19:54.680
-What is wrong with you?

19:54.720 --> 20:00.359
-You didn't tell me when to be
here, but sure, my fault.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.680
You know, this whole inclusion
thing you're attempting--

20:03.720 --> 20:05.160
I'd give it up.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.200
-Grace, Tara has been begging
everyone to give you another

20:07.240 --> 20:08.200
chance since the start of

20:08.240 --> 20:09.680
the year -Has she?

20:09.720 --> 20:12.200
Such a saint.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.319
Did you ever think that
I knew him too?

20:15.359 --> 20:16.519
I knew Sammy for a whole year.

20:16.559 --> 20:18.720
But do you invite me
to the memorial?

20:18.759 --> 20:21.079
No, you shut me out of
the cool kids club.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.160
-There's no club, is there?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.200
-Don't you dare bring
him up like that.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.319
-Your actions at the Prix
indicated that you didn't care

20:27.359 --> 20:30.200
about Sammy at all.

20:30.240 --> 20:34.319
-I came back this year
because I thought--

20:34.359 --> 20:35.720
I don't know what I thought.

20:35.759 --> 20:38.480
But it really is going to be
fun watching you tear each

20:38.519 --> 20:39.680
other apart to get a contract.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.200
-No.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.640
-Kisses.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.359
-Thought you put yourself
onto salad.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.759
-It's tasty if you eat
around the chlorine.

21:10.279 --> 21:11.799
-The worst part is,
Grace is right.

21:11.839 --> 21:13.599
I've been trying to be the
glue like Sammy was.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.799
But I'm not him, obviously.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.039
This year is going to fly by so
fast, and we're all going

21:20.079 --> 21:22.480
to be in different places.

the roles.

-How about we don't
read them now.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.160
I want to see the
monkeys dance.

21:38.519 --> 21:39.839
-I'm on it.

TARA NARRATING: Third year was
always going to be the

21:41.359 --> 21:43.200
ultimate endurance test.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.039
And don't worry--

21:45.079 --> 21:47.079
I'm not going to give a moment
by moment account of

21:47.119 --> 21:48.480
everything that happened.

21:48.519 --> 21:51.319
But I did get lucky that
particular time.

21:51.359 --> 21:53.400
Turned out there were three
fill-in roles, and

21:53.440 --> 21:55.240
I got one of them.

21:55.279 --> 21:57.680
My friend Ben also
received a role.

22:22.880 --> 22:27.400
-So-- to exploring
other options.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.640
-Yep.

TARA NARRATING: The Prix de
Fonteyn champion received the

23:08.839 --> 23:14.759
third fill-in role, but we all
could have predicted that.

23:14.799 --> 23:18.160
The most confronting thing about
third year is it forced

23:18.200 --> 23:21.640
us to dig deeper, discover parts
of ourselves we didn't

23:21.680 --> 23:25.359
know existed, didn't want to.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.119
But even when it got tough, I
don't think we gave up hope.

-I lied to everyone that
I know where you are.

I think I just need to believe
that you're OK.
