{\an3}- We just keep
missing him.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.311
- Fresh Beats!
all: Reed!

17:42.394 --> 17:44.062
- The banana monster's
been spotted near City Hall.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.774
Get over there now
and stop him!

17:46.857 --> 17:48.859
- We're on it, Reed.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.028
- Wait, better throw out the
rest of this super grow spray

17:51.111 --> 17:54.490
before it causes
any more problems.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.742
Yuck, it's dripping.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.665
[all chattering]

18:12.174 --> 18:13.884
- Ah!

18:16.261 --> 18:17.096
[all exclaim]

18:19.181 --> 18:21.391
- Okay, the fire hose is
hooked up to the tank

18:21.475 --> 18:23.185
with the shrinking
spray solution.

18:23.268 --> 18:27.147
Kiki, Marina, it's time to get
our big banana buddy over here.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.524
- Banana thirsty!

18:28.607 --> 18:31.902
- We've got eyes on the prize,
Firefighter Shout.

18:31.985 --> 18:35.614
I repeat, the big banana
is peeling this way.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.449
- He's got Bo Monkey with him.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.618
- Hey, big giant
banana monster thing!

18:39.701 --> 18:41.203
Over here!
I've got water!

18:42.704 --> 18:46.375
- Thirsty.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.545
- He's headed your way, Shout!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.713
- Kay, you spray him,
and I'll grab Bo.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.092
- Fresh Beats, I think we have
a bigger problem.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.347
{\an1}- Uh, guys?
Am I crazy, or is that a--

19:00.430 --> 19:02.224
all: Giant bunny!

19:02.307 --> 19:03.725
- Where did that come from?

19:03.809 --> 19:06.687
{\an3}- He must have found
the super growth spray.

19:06.770 --> 19:11.149
- Ooh, ooh, ah.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.318
- [laughing]

19:13.402 --> 19:16.196
- [chattering]

19:17.573 --> 19:20.075
[groans]

19:25.998 --> 19:28.125
- We have to save Bo
and Planty

19:28.208 --> 19:31.712
from that giant-banana-eating
giant bunny!

19:32.671 --> 19:34.756
Uh-oh.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.757
We have to save <i> me</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:37.593
{\an3}from the giant-banana-eating
giant bunny!

19:37.676 --> 19:38.886
- Hey, banana monster!

19:38.969 --> 19:40.304
I've got your solution
right here.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.513
- [gurgles]

19:41.597 --> 19:43.765
- Drink up
and shrink down.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.018
- [hiccups]

19:50.480 --> 19:51.398
- Bo!

19:51.481 --> 19:54.651
Ha, got you, buddy!

19:54.735 --> 19:55.319
- Glad you're okay, Bo.

19:58.113 --> 20:02.367
The giant bunny is still
after the banana plant!

20:02.451 --> 20:04.286
{\an1}- Whoa!

20:04.369 --> 20:05.746
I'm okay.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.789
{\an1}- We need that giant bunny
to drink the shrinking solution.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.333
- I've got it.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.419
What we need is something
that giant bunnies love,

20:12.502 --> 20:15.130
something that giant bunnies
can't resist no matter what,

20:15.213 --> 20:17.841
something that will taste so
yummy in his giant bunny tummy

20:17.925 --> 20:19.843
that he'll want to
drink it all up.

20:19.927 --> 20:24.264
What we need is a giant
banana smoothie!

20:24.348 --> 20:27.267
{\an1}- Twist, how are we going
to make a smoothie that big?

20:27.351 --> 20:31.605
- Add more, little more,
little more.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.649
Backing up, backing up.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.359
And stop!

20:35.442 --> 20:36.818
- Let 'er rip!

20:38.779 --> 20:40.822
- Time to blend it up.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.910
- Wait, we have to mix in
the shrinking solution.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.705
- Sweet! It's a massive
banana smoothie!

20:50.123 --> 20:53.377

[slurping]

21:11.895 --> 21:14.690
[all cheering]

21:14.773 --> 21:15.524
- It worked.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.359
The bunny's back to normal.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.527
Great job, Fresh Beats.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.028
{\an3}- [sighs]

21:20.112 --> 21:24.116
- Here you go, little bunny.
Have a banana.

21:24.199 --> 21:27.119
Aw, what a cute
wittle bunny.

21:27.202 --> 21:27.869
Can we keep him?

21:27.953 --> 21:30.789
- Banana-picking party!

[funky music]

21:34.876 --> 21:37.045
- Great job, Fresh Beats.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.631
You saved the city from
the giant bunny

21:39.715 --> 21:40.716
and the banana monster

21:40.799 --> 21:44.136
and helped clean up
the slippery goo.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.555
We couldn't have done it
without you.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.056

with a...

21:48.140 --> 21:50.976

21:51.059 --> 21:54.021
Sweet!
Like, really sweet.
