WEBVTT

00:51.968 --> 00:53.583
Come on, Willa.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.915
Okay.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.834
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah, that's pretty right there.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.216
The flower should
go, like, there.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.438
Put them all
on the flowers.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.528
Hurry, we 're gonna get in trouble.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.878
- Come on.
- Coming.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.952
Do you hear me?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.782
Are you out
of your mind, Nick?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.869
-Sorry.
- I swear if you do that again,

02:51.963 --> 02:54.500
I will leave you in the goddamn ocean,
I shit you not.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.040
- I thought I heard something.
- What? What could you hear?

02:57.135 --> 02:59.797
I don't know.
Something bumping the hull.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.549
Yeah, well, you almost
got yourself killed.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.554
You almost got
Travis killed.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.465
We're still trying
to help people, aren't we?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.634
Yes.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.894
People that we can see.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.606
Maddy.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.482
Nick found a logbook
to that boat.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.610
We got a problem.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.606
San Diego's dead.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.991
- How bad?
- It's gone.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.943
- What? Wait, wait, wait.
- What do you mean gone?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.654
lt's burned.
The military burned it down.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.161
According to this,
the Leigh Anne

03:30.251 --> 03:32.207
just came from the south right there.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.160
Wait a minute, / thought
you said San Diego was safe.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.041
I wouldn't take
this as gospel.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.044
Did they even try to dock?
Did they go ashore?

03:39.135 --> 03:40.921
- How do they know?
- The logs are clear.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.424
The last entry was yesterday.
What is there to doubt?

03:43.473 --> 03:46.135
If we're going to San Diego,
we need to know what's there.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.184
Right now I'm trying
to focus on what's about to be here.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.261
And what kind of weapon would you suppose
would be big enough to sink that boat?

03:51.272 --> 03:52.808
And what kind of weapon would you suppose
would be big enough to sink that boat?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.060
- .50 caliber machine gun.
-Military grade.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.142
The kind of weapon that could only
be mounted on a larger vessel.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.563
The kind of weapon that could only
be mounted on a larger vessel.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.524
Larger vessel.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.655
You sure it's following us?

04:02.700 --> 04:05.112
l have zigged and l have zagged,
their course corrects every time.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.740
- It could be them. - It could be Alicia's radio
crush for all we know.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.207
Which is why we don't
talk to strangers.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.282
Whoever it is,
we're not losing it.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.954
Whoever it is,
we're not losing it.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.170
- And it's faster.
- Fine, where do we go?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.214
What do we do now?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.257
We hide.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.586
We'll lose them on the radar
if we stick to the coast.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.722
Hmm, this one has a cove.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.307
Sure, so does this one.
Just as deep.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.434
And this is a wildlife refuge.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.223
There '/I be
a ranger station there.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.149
Which will probably
be abandoned.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.853
Sure, but a ranger station's gonna
have shortwave radio, supplies.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.485
- We can gather information.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.650
Then that's where we go.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.120
Catrina Island it is.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.008
Chris?

05:09.100 --> 05:11.011
Hey.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.559
We're gonna land soon.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.936
Get away from
what's out there.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.309
Catch our breath.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.976
Looks like a good place.
It'll be safer.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.352
Looks like a good place.
It'll be safer.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.941
How do you know?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.851
You see that?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.849
Light came on
in that house.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.360
Are you coming?

06:08.451 --> 06:10.567
I'll stay.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.235
Make sure our radar friend
moves past us.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.037
When he's gone,
we're gone.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.160
Ofelia and I will
keep you company.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.287
Solitude doesn't bother me.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.619
We insist.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.888
Someone's home.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.723
They're not throwing
their doors open.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.689
No, they're scared.
We'd be scared, too.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.285
You see anything?

07:07.510 --> 07:08.875
Hello?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.210
Travis.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.681
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

07:12.723 --> 07:14.714
We know you're in there.
We know you're scared.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.261
We know you're in there.
We know you're scared.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.808
We are, too.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.518
We just need information.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.021
We're not a threat.
We're not sick.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.192
We're not a threat.
We're not sick.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.491
We're just--

07:35.788 --> 07:37.904
we need help.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.461
Harry! Harry!

07:49.552 --> 07:51.213
Get back here.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.142
Sorry, he's excited
to see people.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.938
It's been a while.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.517
We just saw your light come on.
We were on the water.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.979
That was an accident.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.950
Travis.
Travis Manawa.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.959
George Geary.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.378
What can I do for you,
Travis Manawa?

08:27.465 --> 08:30.002
We had to drop anchor.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.083
It's no safer on sea
than on land.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.345
It's no safer on sea
than on land.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.420
What makes you think
here is safe?

08:35.431 --> 08:36.716
What makes you think
here is safe?

08:36.766 --> 08:39.724
We just need to get our
bearings and we'll be gone.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.346
You have nothing
to fear from us.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.437
You have nothing
to fear from us.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.902
You're welcome
to take something.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.488
Thanks.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.951
Had a stack of books
by my bed.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.582
Tried to get through
one a week.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.661
Always fell behind,
though.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.749
Can't imagine having
time for it now.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.795
Can't imagine having
time for it now.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.256
You got nothing
but time, man.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.349
Take it.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.896
Nobody's writing
any new ones for a while.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.152
You folks
are from Los Angeles.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.855
You got that air
aboutyou.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.285
We left when
they started bombing.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.283
Napalm.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.081
It's what they're using
up and down the coast.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.001
I've been checking in with some
of the other ranger stations.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.786
Is it every city?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.250
As far as I can tell.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.127
Portland, Seattle,

09:54.218 --> 09:56.083
Vancouver.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.094
And south?

09:59.181 --> 10:01.172
San Diego was burned.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.846
Further south?

10:04.895 --> 10:07.307
They shut down
the border.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.013
No way in or out.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.897
Oh, God.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.398
So what's left?

10:14.488 --> 10:17.104
Not a hell of a lot.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.941
Interior is no better
than the coast.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.950
Last time I connected
to Joshua Tree,

10:21.996 --> 10:23.987
ranger said
Petrified Forest, gone.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.829
ranger said
Petrified Forest, gone.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.082
JT shut down soon after.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.789
That's Cali,
that's Arizona.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.544
Zion went dark
before them.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.293
Utah gone.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.795
Rocky Mountain station is dead.
That's Colorado.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.425
That's the Continental
Divide.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.798
That's a good goddamn
half the country.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.516
Did you work?

10:45.603 --> 10:47.594
Uh,yeah.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.845
Uh,yeah.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.310
l was a high school
guidance counselor.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.392
Really?
I have my MSW.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.853
I worked with a lot of kids
out of LA Unified.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.022
- Did you?
-Yeah.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.407
Had a whole other life
before George.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.359
A whole other life.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.615
Did you like it?
Your work?

11:08.626 --> 11:09.911
Did you like it?
Your work?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.121
Yeah.
llovedit

11:12.213 --> 11:14.204
Did you ever
find it hard, though,

11:14.298 --> 11:16.289
looking after other people's kids
when you had your own to worry about?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.006
looking after other people's kids
when you had your own to worry about?

11:18.052 --> 11:20.964
Well, it can be hard,
but kids are funny.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.004
You know, I mean, each one
needs something different.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.551
You know, I mean, each one
needs something different.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.633
Even if I felt I didn't have
anything left to give, I'd find it.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.134
Even if I felt I didn't have
anything left to give, I'd find it.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.806
So was it always
a high school level?

11:33.859 --> 11:35.565
Did you ever work
with younger kids?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.190
No, never had the chance.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.817
It wasn't 'cause you didn't
like little kids, though, huh?

11:40.866 --> 11:42.731
No. No.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.943
l have two of my own.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.372
- I liked them better when they were little.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.073
Mom.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.163
This is my eldest, Seth.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.212
-Seth, this is Madison.
- Hi.

11:56.298 --> 11:59.131
- You good, Mom?
-Yeah.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.461
We're just having a chat.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.179
So nice to have a visitor.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.385
How are you?

12:07.476 --> 12:09.262
I'm good.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.929
Where's Dad?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.473
He's in the study
with her husband.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.689
All right. I'll be back
in a little while.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.119
You have any more
of that wine?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.505
Will we stay?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.346
This is only temporary.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.472
We have no place to go.
Why don't we just stay here?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.518
We have no place to go.
Why don't we just stay here?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.850
We would have
to be invited.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.153
- Would we really?
- Yes.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.155
That's very polite of us.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.789
Did you take
your antibiotics?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.412
Yes.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.713
I'm starting to understand
this world better.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.791
After all your mother and I did to try
to protect you from a certain life,

13:22.802 --> 13:24.838
After all your mother and I did to try
to protect you from a certain life,

13:24.929 --> 13:26.920
this is not the world that
you were supposed to know.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.262
this is not the world that
you were supposed to know.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.593
That's okay.
It's good.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.675
Understanding this world,

13:32.686 --> 13:33.937
Understanding this world,

13:33.979 --> 13:35.594
it helps me
understand you.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.102
It's cruel.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.701
Aim and shoot.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.495
- All right.
-You're doing it wrong.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.573
You have to go like this to
jump and then that to roll--

13:55.584 --> 13:57.199
You have to go like this to
jump and then that to roll--

13:57.253 --> 13:58.663
All right,
okay,okay,okay.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.965
What are posies?

14:10.975 --> 14:13.091
Posies are flowers.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.304
Why do you put them
in your pockets?

14:15.354 --> 14:17.345
Um, well,
a long time ago

14:17.356 --> 14:19.221
Um, well,
a long time ago

14:19.275 --> 14:21.266
across the ocean
in Europe,

14:21.318 --> 14:23.274
there was a virus that made a
lot of people really sick.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.732
And they didn't have
the medicine we do now,

14:25.823 --> 14:27.814
so they gave them flowers
to make them healthy.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.156
so they gave them flowers
to make them healthy.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.157
Did it work?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.285
No.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.494
Nick, you want
to come see our room?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.167
Yeah, let's do it.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.125
Hey, man, you want to come
check out Harry's room?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.505
I'm good.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.838
Look, you don't have
to talk or anything,

14:48.929 --> 14:51.306
but it is better
to be with people.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.555
It's okay.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.758
Okay.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.889
Come on, let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.604
VVhoa,cooH

15:04.695 --> 15:06.231
This is your room?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.066
Yeah.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.980
Wow.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.822
And who are these guys?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.199
These are campers.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.079
Neighbors.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.582
The Colbys.
And Uncle Kyle.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.842
What happened to them?
What's this?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.920
It's what has to happen now
when people get sick.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.138
It's what has to happen now
when people get sick.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.094
Yeah.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.601
Hey, that won't
happen to you.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.680
I know, because I
have power pills!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.982
Yeah!

15:45.069 --> 15:46.730
I don't know
what that is.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.321
It's like a vitamin.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.106
If I take it,
my family stays together.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.860
So which one
is your favorite?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.662
The general.
He has a gun, too.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.831
You just have
to put it on him.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.785
Right.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.225
What the hell
is taking them so long?

16:20.270 --> 16:22.682
You got somewhere
you got to go?

16:22.773 --> 16:24.638
I don't like sitting
on my behind.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.940
Target practice
on a $10 million boat.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.358
Hmm.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.360
Your $10 million boat.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.397
- What?
- You said "a $10 million boat"

16:32.408 --> 16:33.648
- What?
- You said "a $10 million boat"

16:33.742 --> 16:35.607
like this boat
is not yours.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.694
It's mine.
Don't you worry.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.115
It's mine.
Don't you worry.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.496
I'm not worried.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.574
I'm curious, though.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.791
I'm curious, though.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.255
Who are you planning
on leaving behind?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.257
I bring you to my house,

16:52.302 --> 16:54.964
take you on my boat--
where's my trust,viejo?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.262
Why would I leave behind
those that I brought with me?

16:57.307 --> 16:58.922
Resources.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.009
You only had so much.
You didn't plan on so many.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.306
You only had so much.
You didn't plan on so many.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.767
We'll do fine.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.600
We have water.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.026
And you're one hell
of a fisherman.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.111
They aren't infected, Travis.
We are.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.487
They aren't infected, Travis.
We are.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.122
We're the weeds
Mother Nature is pulling.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.835
What's happening
is not natural.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.049
Oh, it couldn't
be more natural.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.714
The world couldn't
sustain itself,

17:32.801 --> 17:34.792
so it stood back
and said, "Enough."

17:34.803 --> 17:36.464
so it stood back
and said, "Enough."

17:36.513 --> 17:39.346
This is its
course correction.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.768
Nature always wins.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.558
Yeah, exactly.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.387
And I'm not telling you
anything new.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.431
Your people get this
better than anyone.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.941
Excuse me?

17:51.028 --> 17:52.063
You're Maori.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.190
Aren't you?

17:54.239 --> 17:56.321
Yeah. |--

17:56.366 --> 17:58.072
not many people guess.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.991
I'm an amateur
anthropologist.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.491
I'm an amateur
lot of shit.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.450
But I've been a student
of your culture

18:04.500 --> 18:06.491
since I was young.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.249
I went to New Zealand
on an exchange.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.411
You been?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.455
Uh, we brought my grandma
back there when she died.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.582
Uh, we brought my grandma
back there when she died.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.587
l was just a kid.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.385
See, that's
incredible to me--

18:19.431 --> 18:21.717
the commitment

18:21.809 --> 18:24.391
to keeping family
on tribal ground

18:24.436 --> 18:26.677
so that every life cycle
begins and ends

18:26.772 --> 18:28.478
on the same sacred earth.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.106
That's beautiful, man.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.729
And it's right.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.562
Yeah, that's why I raised
my family out here.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.438
Yeah, that's why I raised
my family out here.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.483
And that's why we'll stay.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.363
So you good if we dock
for the night?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.659
So you good if we dock
for the night?

18:46.750 --> 18:47.865
We should be gone
by tomorrow.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.871
Yeah, of course.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.873
| feel lucky.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.955
How so?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.297
How so?

18:55.342 --> 18:58.049
We had no idea what kind of
hell might come off that boat.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.803
We found new friends.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.179
- How bad?
- What we thought.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.853
San Diego, the whole
West Coast, dead.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.101
I can't believe it.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.183
George thinks it's all part
of nature's grand plan.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.934
George thinks it's all part
of nature's grand plan.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.485
Yeah, he's intense.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.364
You have no idea.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.491
Melissa was grilling me
about my job

19:22.536 --> 19:24.026
like it was an interview.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.576
Maybe she's curious
about the outside world.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.877
They never go
to the mainland.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.451
Never?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.369
- Yeah.
- He told you that?

19:34.423 --> 19:36.414
He believes in man's
connection with his land.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.585
He believes in man's
connection with his land.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.514
She turned the light on
on purpose.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.551
George said it was an accident.
She knew what she was doing.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.768
George said it was an accident.
She knew what she was doing.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.891
Think she wants
to get off the island?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.847
Yeah, and if he doesn't,

19:53.942 --> 19:55.728
maybe she's scared
to say so.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.909
Hey, you want to know what the most
underrated perk of the apocalypse is?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.251
Hey, you want to know what the most
underrated perk of the apocalypse is?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.499
Yeah.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.581
No planes.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.502
No noise pollution.
No smog.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.678
Just stars.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.465
Yep, well,

20:28.518 --> 20:31.430
we definitely stopped
the climate crisis.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.971
Awesome.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.182
Why are you up?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.351
Why are you up?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.689
I drank too much wine.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.991
My mind's racing.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.864
Come on,
what's your excuse?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.946
It's these kids, man.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.697
It's these kids, man.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.741
They've seen more than
their share, you know?

20:53.752 --> 20:54.787
They've seen more than
their share, you know?

20:54.878 --> 20:56.869
Like, what they're living in now
and what they're gonna live in,

20:56.880 --> 20:58.120
Like, what they're living in now
and what they're gonna live in,

20:58.215 --> 21:00.376
like, it's-- I don't know.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.337
Things are neverjust gonna
be normal for them, you know?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.671
It's not fair.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.717
It's not fair.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.631
I mean, at least
they're prepared.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.267
Yeah, they're prepared
like it's the end times.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.475
Isn't it?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.810
No, Alicia,
it's not the Rapture.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.899
Something is off here.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.070
Something is off here.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.073
Everything's off.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.995
Everywhere.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.656
Hey, where you going?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.791
I got chores.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.747
You can help,
you want to.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.963
What are we doing?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.885
Maintenance.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.682
- Where are they coming from?
-Mainland.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.219
Ships gone down
between us and the coast.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.020
The current drops
them off here.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.564
My dad says
it's a tidal anomaly.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.194
Gunfire brings more,

22:54.289 --> 22:56.245
so we have
to work quietly.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.289
How many are there?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.288
New ones every day.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.335
It's a pain
in the ass.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.380
You want a turn?

23:15.685 --> 23:17.676
Hey, you seen Chris?

23:17.687 --> 23:19.678
Hey, you seen Chris?

23:19.731 --> 23:21.517
Can't have got far,
though, right?

23:23.693 --> 23:26.184
He didn't go that way.
He's on the boat.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.565
-Or on land.
- I looked over the boat.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.606
Then he's onshore. You want
me to help you ﬁnd him?

23:30.617 --> 23:31.948
Then he's onshore. You want
me to help you ﬁnd him?

23:32.035 --> 23:34.526
I'll go.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.160
Okay.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.455
Hey, Travis. I can help
if you want, though.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.204
I know at-risk youths.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.876
I am at-risk youths.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.587
That's good--
temple, socket,

23:49.636 --> 23:51.547
base of skull if their
back's to you.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.638
How'd you learn this?

23:55.684 --> 23:57.345
My dad.
How to kill.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.427
How to survive
under most conditions.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.644
How to survive
under most conditions.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.271
Been preparing for this
kind of thing forever.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.690
So he's like
a survivalist?

24:05.735 --> 24:08.147
Nah, he's just self-reliant.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.570
Deliberate living,
you know?

24:17.205 --> 24:20.163
There it is.
Good job.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.710
Yeah.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.961
That's that. Come back after
lunch, again before dinner.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.382
That's that. Come back after
lunch, again before dinner.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.305
Hey, can they climb?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.383
Haven't seen that yet.
They're pretty clumsy.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.600
Haven't seen that yet.
They're pretty clumsy.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.179
Hey, there's one more.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.606
- We'll get it later.
- No, I got it.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.812
Bring the ax back
when you're done.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.486
Have fun.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.988
Your son's
a natural, sir.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.324
- Chris.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.501
Chris,
what are you doing?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.078
Being of use.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.129
Come to the boat, huh?

25:10.217 --> 25:11.673
Yeah, lwill.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.209
- Come on, please, Chris.
- In a minute.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.919
Chris.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.382
Chris!

25:26.358 --> 25:29.270
There. Done.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.072
Morning, neighbor.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.158
Hey, you got a problem
down on the fence line.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.249
Hey, you got a problem
down on the fence line.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.248
Near the water.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.955
Yeah, they wash up
there sometime.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.545
Seth manages it.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.002
I saw him.
My son was with him.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.009
Helping him.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.512
We can't let them
press the fence.

26:02.602 --> 26:05.184
We go out once a week
and clear out the bodies.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.310
You okay?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.361
He had a pickax.

26:15.448 --> 26:17.439
He was swinging it
like-- I don't...

26:20.787 --> 26:22.323
My son used
to mow the lawn,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.200
take out the garbage,
you know?

26:24.291 --> 26:26.031
Tidied his room.
Cleared the dishes.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.583
That's--
this is...

26:32.090 --> 26:34.081
This is how we manage now
for as long as we can.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.083
This is how we manage now
for as long as we can.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.168
That's how it is.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.721
Take a ride with me.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.176
Come on.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.900
There's infected
over there?

26:53.945 --> 26:56.106
Yeah.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.062
Weekenders who got
caught on the island

26:58.116 --> 27:00.528
when the ferries
went down.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.610
/ figure there '8
a couple of hundred.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.580
The ones who wash up
on the beach we can manage.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.044
But if they get
a whiff of us,

27:10.086 --> 27:12.793
that could be a problem.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.454
Hold that.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.126
Why would you
stay here?

27:19.220 --> 27:20.835
This is it.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.965
We all die.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.009
It's a question
of surrender or survival.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.510
It's a question
of surrender or survival.

27:28.605 --> 27:31.563
Acceptance or denial.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.642
I choose survival.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.227
Yeah, you think
everything's gonna be okay?

27:38.490 --> 27:40.651
Look, you saw the map.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.698
That's our truth.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.777
It's not right or wrong,
good or bad.

27:44.788 --> 27:45.823
It's not right or wrong,
good or bad.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.282
ltjust is.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.120
How can you just give up?

27:51.211 --> 27:53.372
I'm not giving up.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.000
I'm mending the fence.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.328
- Hi, Nick.
- Hey!

30:33.414 --> 30:36.372
Willa.
Where is everybody?

30:36.459 --> 30:38.245
Come draw with me.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.285
Oh, |-- I can't draw.
No, no, no.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.411
Oh, |-- I can't draw.
No, no, no.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.747
- Draw.
- All right, come on.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.208
Come on.
What should we draw?

30:56.813 --> 30:58.804
You hover over me like the
specter of death, Daniel.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.771
You hover over me like the
specter of death, Daniel.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.851
Maybe I am.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.810
Or your guardian angel.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.905
Our friend is gone.
We sail with the tide.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.827
Our friend is gone.
We sail with the tide.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.098
Morning.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.095
That's not necessary.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.185
It's the least
I can do.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.526
Did you sleep okay?

31:47.614 --> 31:49.445
No. You?

31:49.532 --> 31:51.523
No.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.617
Did you get everything
you wanted?

31:55.705 --> 31:57.445
All the information
you needed?

31:57.540 --> 31:59.326
We know where
not to go now.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.460
We should be leaving soon.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.883
It's a short trip.

32:18.978 --> 32:21.685
Melissa, the light.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.264
The light you turned
on last night.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.854
Was that an accident?

32:30.657 --> 32:32.648
That was just a mistake.
It's a stupid habit.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.694
That was just a mistake.
It's a stupid habit.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.776
Once is a mistake.
Twice?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.197
Once is a mistake.
Twice?

32:37.246 --> 32:39.282
Were you signaling us?

32:48.383 --> 32:50.374
I saw you from
the pier last night.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.500
I saw you from
the pier last night.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.585
I watched you on the deck
with the binoculars.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.762
| just--

32:55.848 --> 32:57.975
when I saw you,

32:58.059 --> 33:00.220
| just had this strange
sense of hope, you know,

33:00.269 --> 33:02.260
like maybe Willa and Harry
would have a chance.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.978
like maybe Willa and Harry
would have a chance.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.057
The kind of chance they're not
gonna have if they stay here.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.399
The kind of chance they're not
gonna have if they stay here.

33:08.444 --> 33:10.901
When I saw you
come to shore,

33:10.989 --> 33:13.776
I turned on the light.

33:15.743 --> 33:18.485
I thought you said
the island was safe.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.322
No, we're just
biding our time.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.448
No, we're just
biding our time.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.537
Biding our time
till it's over.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.869
Come with us.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.831
I can't.
I'm not well.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.502
l have MS.
It's--

33:35.596 --> 33:37.587
I'm not gonna die tomorrow, but
it's not a weight you need.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.338
I'm not gonna die tomorrow, but
it's not a weight you need.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.849
- It's not a weight my children need.
- What about George?

33:41.936 --> 33:43.801
If we could take all of you,
wouldn't he agree to--

33:43.896 --> 33:45.887
George is not
gonna leave this place.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.604
George is not
gonna leave this place.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.683
He thinks it's better to die with
family than to die with strangers.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.059
He thinks it's better to die with
family than to die with strangers.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.695
Seth is the same way.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.826
You want us to take
Harry and Willa?

34:07.795 --> 34:09.626
She's sick.
She can't leave.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.579
She's convinced if they
stay here, they all die.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.507
They have supplies,
water, food.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.835
- They even have power.
- And they have infected.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.090
All along their fence,
others at the marina.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.594
How long till they make their way up there?
It's not secure.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.015
Yeah, I know,
I talked to George.

34:23.102 --> 34:24.603
He's got strong opinions,

34:24.687 --> 34:26.723
but all the man cares about
is keeping his family safe.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.679
That's all I care about.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.766
They're just biding time
until it all goes bad.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.483
They're just biding time
until it all goes bad.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.735
Who's to say we're not
biding time out there?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.687
Where we land next
could be safer.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.741
What we find could save us, all of us.
We don't know.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.863
Well, I can't take the man's
kids just 'cause she says so.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.285
Then don't do it
because she says so.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.367
Do it because
I'm asking you to.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.285
You're not taking them, Travis.
You're saving them.

34:50.296 --> 34:51.376
You're not taking them, Travis.
You're saving them.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.673
We can't keep leaving
people behind.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.891
Let me talk to George.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.394
Okay?
Let me talk to him.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.763
Okay.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.438
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.627
Mexico.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.831
Mm-hmm.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.251
It's me.
Yes, it's all clear now.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.377
It's me.
Yes, it's all clear now.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.598
What's the latest
you can push it?

36:30.563 --> 36:32.178
Sundown.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.649
I'll be there.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.985
I will be there.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.464
What's wrong?

37:07.516 --> 37:09.507
I think this asshole's planning
on Jonestowning his whole family.

37:09.518 --> 37:10.644
I think this asshole's planning
on Jonestowning his whole family.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.392
What?

37:12.438 --> 37:13.939
I found pills
in his office.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.638
I think it's poison.

37:15.691 --> 37:18.683
- Well, how do you know?
- I know my pharmaceuticals.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.769
And I know pillheads.
Those people are not that.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.815
And I know pillheads.
Those people are not that.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.897
And those pills
are not recreational.

37:23.908 --> 37:24.988
And those pills
are not recreational.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.881
They'll be right down.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.972
Do they understand?

37:54.063 --> 37:56.054
Um, told them they were
going on a boat ride.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.646
Um, told them they were
going on a boat ride.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.102
They'd be back
in a couple of days.

37:59.193 --> 38:01.525
I think they're
excited about it.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.561
We'll take care of them, I promise you.
We'll keep them safe.

38:03.572 --> 38:04.698
We'll take care of them, I promise you.
We'll keep them safe.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.773
This-- this is Harry's.

38:07.868 --> 38:10.200
He gets scared at night.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.279
He pretends not to, but he ends up
crawling into his sister's bed.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.155
He pretends not to, but he ends up
crawling into his sister's bed.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.616
- It's okay. - We've been trying to
discourage him from that,

38:16.669 --> 38:17.909
but I think
it's okay, you know?

38:18.004 --> 38:20.336
If he does that,
it's okay.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.414
And Willa,
her hair is--

38:22.425 --> 38:24.256
And Willa,
her hair is--

38:24.343 --> 38:26.755
she has this hair--
she'll cry if you comb it,

38:26.804 --> 38:28.920
so just wait till you shampoo
and put conditioner in it

38:29.015 --> 38:31.006
and then it'll be
a lot easier.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.341
What's going on?

38:33.436 --> 38:35.142
Hey, George.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.852
What is this?
Melissa?

38:39.942 --> 38:41.933
- George.
- Why?

38:41.944 --> 38:43.730
- George.
- Why?

38:43.779 --> 38:46.441
- Why?
- Listen to me.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.776
I love you.
I love our family.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.200
But we have to give
them a chance.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.278
I can't look at them every day and
see nothing for them, I just can't.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.995
I can't look at them every day and
see nothing for them, I just can't.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.459
- Mama?
- George.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.878
What, sweetie?
What's wrong?

39:02.131 --> 39:04.543
What? Tell me.
Tell Mommy.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.628
It's okay.
Tell me what's wrong.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.635
Something's wrong
with Willa.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.844
Stay here. Don't move, Harry.
Stay right there.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.806
Willa.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.221
Willa. Willa.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.056
Willa! What--

39:25.279 --> 39:26.780
Baby!

39:26.822 --> 39:29.404
- What happened, buddy?
- She took her pill.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.242
- No, Willa.
- Melissa.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.197
No, get out of here!

39:40.252 --> 39:41.913
Will--

39:44.298 --> 39:46.289
Melissa. Melissa.
No, you can't hold her.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.801
Melissa. Melissa.
No, you can't hold her.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.175
- It's not safe to hold her.
- She knows.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.714
Maddy.

39:57.269 --> 39:59.100
Get Harry away from this.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.019
- Take him out.
- Come with us.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.187
- No.
- You can't save them.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.400
I'm not going to.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.021
Go. Go.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.952
- What happened?
- They turned.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.500
We're taking
the boy with us.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.373
I want my dad.
I want my mama.

40:28.467 --> 40:31.129
I know, I know, but
this is what they want.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.756
They want us
to take care of you.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.887
What happened to Willa? Did--

40:34.974 --> 40:36.339
She got sick,
all right?

40:39.395 --> 40:40.976
Come on,
let's go inside.

40:41.063 --> 40:43.395
Madison, what have
you done now?

40:43.482 --> 40:45.313
We're taking him with us.
We have room.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.187
- Put him back where you found him.
- We have room.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.610
We do not. Children are the
definition of deadweight.

40:49.655 --> 40:52.317
You're not doing this again. You
don't decide who lives and who dies.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.989
- That's exactly what I do.
- There's no debate.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.738
We're doing this.
Now move the goddamn boat.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.618
Stop!

41:01.667 --> 41:04.329
Get back!
Get back!

41:04.420 --> 41:06.411
Harry. Harry, come here.
I'm taking you home.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.753
Harry. Harry, come here.
I'm taking you home.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.254
No, no.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.206
- There's no home anymore.
- Shut up.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.792
- You don't know what's back there.
- Shut up!

41:12.845 --> 41:14.676
- Listen to me.
- I know what's there.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.179
It's our home.
This is still our home.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.972
Seth, your dad doesn't
want this anymore.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.219
He told us
to take care of him.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.302
My father told me
what he wants.

41:22.396 --> 41:25.183
- He taught me.
- But he changed his mind.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.481
No, no, I don't
believe you.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.559
Come with us, Seth.
Please.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.401
Come with us, Seth.
Please.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.445
Daniel, don't.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.363
I can get at least
one of you guys.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.442
Maybe more.
Is that what you want?

41:37.453 --> 41:38.693
Maybe more.
Is that what you want?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.737
Hmm? Just let us go home.
Just let us go.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.739
Hmm? Just let us go home.
Just let us go.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.953
Harry, come here.
Come on.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.958
You caused this.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.801
All right, come here.
Come here.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.069
Oh, my God.

42:18.452 --> 42:20.989
Papa, mira.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.369
Mama?

42:28.712 --> 42:31.044
Can't you do something?

42:31.131 --> 42:33.338
The kid has a rifle.

42:37.471 --> 42:39.427
Mama?

42:42.685 --> 42:44.676
I want you to wave good-bye
to the nice people, okay?

42:44.728 --> 42:46.719
All right,
just keep waving.

42:52.278 --> 42:54.109
Oh, Chris, don't look.
