02:57.144 --> 03:01.149
Thank you. Hi.
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

03:01.816 --> 03:03.569
This is my cab.

03:04.153 --> 03:05.988
I was here first!

03:06.238 --> 03:07.741
Oh, God.

03:16.251 --> 03:18.253
Let's go across. Come on.

03:19.255 --> 03:21.591
We'll get one down the road. Hurry.

03:26.515 --> 03:29.684
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?

03:29.935 --> 03:31.687
I'm trying to get a... Taxi!

03:31.771 --> 03:33.940
We're going the wrong way!

03:35.609 --> 03:37.946
Put that away. We look like tourists.

03:38.947 --> 03:40.949
Let's cut over to Seventh.

03:41.157 --> 03:44.245
- Seventh is <i>that</i> way.
- I know where we are!

04:05.230 --> 04:07.065
Hey, give me a dollar.

04:08.108 --> 04:10.111
How about it? One dollar.

04:10.778 --> 04:13.282
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?

04:13.615 --> 04:15.451
Come on! Up here.

04:19.289 --> 04:20.624
Hey, lady...

04:20.791 --> 04:23.252
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

04:43.319 --> 04:45.155
Hey, all right!

04:45.489 --> 04:47.491
American Express card.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.952
"Don't leave home without it."

04:50.620 --> 04:52.456
Get out of here.

04:55.668 --> 04:57.670
I don't like it up here.

04:57.837 --> 04:59.673
Are you scared of heights?

05:00.508 --> 05:03.512
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs...

05:03.678 --> 05:08.017
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

05:09.185 --> 05:11.230
That ain't what I heard at all.

05:13.023 --> 05:14.943
I heard that the Bat got him.

05:15.026 --> 05:18.029
The Bat? Give me a break, will you?

05:18.363 --> 05:22.034
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

05:22.368 --> 05:25.705
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

05:29.168 --> 05:32.339
- I'm getting out of here.
- Shut up. Listen to me.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.884
There ain't no Bat.

05:36.177 --> 05:39.515
You shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid.

05:39.723 --> 05:44.563
You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up! <i>Shut up!</i>

06:28.869 --> 06:30.120
Don't kill me!

06:30.287 --> 06:31.538
Don't kill me!

06:32.039 --> 06:34.042
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

06:34.292 --> 06:37.129
I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.048
Tell all your friends about me.

06:39.131 --> 06:40.383
What are you?

06:41.718 --> 06:43.053
I'm Batman.

07:04.163 --> 07:05.748
Across this nation...

07:05.915 --> 07:09.920
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

07:10.504 --> 07:14.259
Our streets are overrun,
our public officials are helpless.

07:14.592 --> 07:18.430
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...

07:18.681 --> 07:20.684
...Boss Carl Grissom.

07:21.017 --> 07:24.355
Now, our new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent...

07:24.689 --> 07:27.359
...will carry out that promise.

07:34.618 --> 07:36.954
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.208
People of Gotham City...

07:41.209 --> 07:43.212
...I'm a man of few words.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.885
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

07:48.218 --> 07:52.640
Commissioner Gordon informs me
that he has targeted those businesses...

07:52.891 --> 07:56.228
<i>... suspected of fronting for</i>
<i>the syndicate in this city.</i>

07:57.898 --> 07:59.691
<i>Before this week is out...</i>

08:00.066 --> 08:03.070
<i>... we are going to knock down their doors...</i>

08:03.404 --> 08:07.743
<i>... and shed the light of the law</i>
<i>on that nest of vipers.</i>

08:10.246 --> 08:14.835
<i>Together, we can make this</i>
<i>city safe for decent people.</i>

08:17.839 --> 08:20.342
Decent people shouldn't live here.

08:20.718 --> 08:23.221
They'd be happier someplace else.

08:23.721 --> 08:26.058
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

08:26.558 --> 08:28.393
Forget about it.

08:28.728 --> 08:33.692
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

08:34.735 --> 08:37.072
If Grissom knew about us...

08:37.572 --> 08:39.908
...he might hand you something.

08:41.034 --> 08:43.371
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

08:43.703 --> 08:48.378
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

08:50.255 --> 08:51.924
And besides...

08:54.260 --> 08:55.929
...he doesn't know.

08:59.224 --> 09:02.061
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?

09:13.075 --> 09:15.078
You look fine.

09:17.247 --> 09:18.958
I didn't ask.

09:26.968 --> 09:28.970
Yeah. Hanging on.

09:38.399 --> 09:39.984
Let me guess.

09:40.234 --> 09:44.740
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

09:44.990 --> 09:47.744
That's it. What are they seeing up there?

09:48.328 --> 09:49.997
They're drinking Drano.

09:50.247 --> 09:51.415
It's weird.

09:51.665 --> 09:53.167
Thanks for the tip.

09:55.003 --> 09:56.504
Christ. Knox.

09:57.088 --> 09:59.842
Lieutenant, I hear we had
another Bat attack.

10:00.092 --> 10:04.932
That's eight sightings in a month.
I hear the Commissioner's opened a file.

10:05.182 --> 10:08.853
Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.

10:10.189 --> 10:12.858
I'm telling you, a giant bat!

10:16.029 --> 10:20.869
Don't write about this.
It will ruin your already useless reputation.

10:21.453 --> 10:24.456
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.460
They say he can't be killed.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.713
They say he drinks blood.

10:29.964 --> 10:33.134
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

10:36.556 --> 10:38.391
You can quote me on that.

10:39.392 --> 10:42.312
Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City?

10:42.563 --> 10:44.732
Is he on the police payroll?

10:44.983 --> 10:47.735
What's he pulling down, after taxes?

11:16.772 --> 11:19.276
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

11:20.152 --> 11:24.157
- Why don't you broadcast it?
- Shut up and listen.

11:25.658 --> 11:29.330
Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.

11:29.622 --> 11:33.960
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, <i>I</i> deal with it.

11:34.629 --> 11:36.631
Your problems are our problems.

11:38.342 --> 11:41.511
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

11:42.179 --> 11:45.016
You ought to think about the future.

11:45.642 --> 11:48.854
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future.

11:50.148 --> 11:53.652
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

11:59.826 --> 12:01.119
Better be sure.

12:06.877 --> 12:07.878
See?

12:08.545 --> 12:11.675
You can make a good
decision when you try.

12:19.518 --> 12:22.230
Where've you been spending your nights?

12:27.736 --> 12:31.241
I don't care if this festival is in debt,
I want a parade.

12:31.408 --> 12:33.744
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.

12:33.995 --> 12:37.666
We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.

12:37.916 --> 12:39.918
We may celebrate in bankruptcy court.

12:40.002 --> 12:43.339
It's $250,000 in debt and we
haven't seen one balloon.

12:43.590 --> 12:47.177
You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.

12:47.261 --> 12:50.098
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.

12:50.348 --> 12:53.436
They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.

12:53.519 --> 12:55.939
I promised that, remember?

12:58.859 --> 13:01.195
Welcome, Count Dracula.

13:01.696 --> 13:04.033
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?

13:04.199 --> 13:07.369
- They buried your story on Batman.
- They bury garbage.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.373
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.710
I got something for you.

13:15.547 --> 13:19.344
Very funny. You should have
put more gore under the fangs.

13:20.053 --> 13:21.721
What a dick.

13:24.391 --> 13:26.060
Hello, legs.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.315
I'm reading your stuff.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.234
Well, I'm reading yours.

13:33.152 --> 13:34.655
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

13:34.821 --> 13:37.824
Yeah, photographer. Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

13:38.075 --> 13:41.245
If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.

13:41.829 --> 13:44.166
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

13:46.586 --> 13:48.421
You could get hurt doing this stuff.

13:48.505 --> 13:50.591
What brings you here?

13:50.925 --> 13:53.761
I'm here to see the wildlife in Gotham City.

13:54.012 --> 13:56.515
Wildlife? Like what?

13:58.184 --> 13:59.852
Like... bats.

14:02.022 --> 14:04.358
- Who sent you?
- Nobody, really.

14:04.608 --> 14:06.778
I just loved your story, and...

14:07.696 --> 14:09.699
...I like bats.

14:12.201 --> 14:15.789
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

14:16.123 --> 14:19.752
Okay, you're a visionary,
and also the only one who believes me.

14:19.877 --> 14:21.672
I need something tangible.

14:21.797 --> 14:25.010
Gordon's got a file.
I can't even get him on the phone.

14:25.635 --> 14:27.804
He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit, right?

14:27.887 --> 14:31.225
Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list.
No.

14:34.062 --> 14:36.899
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?

14:37.233 --> 14:39.235
- No.
- Buy me lunch?

14:39.485 --> 14:41.989
- Maybe.
- I eat light.

14:49.206 --> 14:50.458
Say this...

14:50.833 --> 14:52.586
...son of a bitch...

14:52.919 --> 14:56.257
...makes a connection with
us <i>and</i> with Axis Chemicals.

14:56.507 --> 14:58.843
What kind of damage are we looking at?

14:59.010 --> 15:02.348
If he ties us with Axis Chemicals,
we're dead and buried.

15:02.556 --> 15:04.893
We should move immediately.

15:05.518 --> 15:08.022
I say we break into the place...

15:08.356 --> 15:10.024
...trash the office...

15:10.566 --> 15:14.738
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

15:17.575 --> 15:20.537
Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...

15:20.746 --> 15:24.084
...I'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

15:26.086 --> 15:27.213
Me?

15:35.223 --> 15:38.059
Would you mind waiting in the next room?

15:51.076 --> 15:53.912
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.

16:08.306 --> 16:10.100
Can somebody else do this?

16:11.268 --> 16:13.646
The fumes in that place...

16:17.609 --> 16:20.279
It's an important job. I need...

16:20.612 --> 16:22.615
...someone I can trust.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.454
You... are my number one guy.

16:28.957 --> 16:30.292
Now...

16:31.626 --> 16:33.296
...don't forget...

16:35.798 --> 16:37.468
...your lucky deck.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.442
My friend...

16:51.193 --> 16:53.946
...your luck is about to change.

16:57.868 --> 16:59.370
<i>Police Department.</i>

16:59.703 --> 17:02.040
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

17:44.468 --> 17:45.970
Can I help you, sir?

18:02.325 --> 18:04.660
- Good evening.
- A little crowded.

18:15.674 --> 18:18.053
Could you tell me who is Bruce Wayne?

18:19.346 --> 18:20.597
I'm not sure.

18:21.390 --> 18:22.725
Thanks anyway.

18:57.143 --> 18:59.646
Eight. I can make that eight.

19:00.147 --> 19:01.982
I can make that eight.

19:02.650 --> 19:05.153
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

19:05.237 --> 19:08.658
Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?

19:08.908 --> 19:12.913
There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.

19:13.163 --> 19:15.499
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.335
How're you making out?

19:17.585 --> 19:19.672
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

19:19.922 --> 19:23.427
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?

19:23.677 --> 19:26.179
We have enough problems in this city...

19:26.430 --> 19:28.933
...without worrying about ghosts.

19:29.183 --> 19:31.687
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

19:33.856 --> 19:35.608
Excuse me, I'll be back.

19:35.859 --> 19:37.694
Won't anybody go on record?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.781
- Your Honor, great suit.
- No comment.

19:42.366 --> 19:43.702
What's up?

19:43.869 --> 19:46.956
Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

19:54.716 --> 19:57.052
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

19:57.218 --> 19:59.638
- Eckhardt.
- Oh, my God!

19:59.889 --> 20:01.307
Come on, let's go.

20:06.147 --> 20:07.648
Mr. Gordon?

20:13.197 --> 20:14.866
Mr. Gordon?

20:24.002 --> 20:27.340
Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.

20:27.882 --> 20:29.718
Look at this stuff.

20:30.052 --> 20:32.054
Who is this guy?

20:32.554 --> 20:37.061
He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

20:37.353 --> 20:41.024
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.

20:41.233 --> 20:44.069
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.

20:44.361 --> 20:47.240
The more they've got,
the less they're worth.

20:47.573 --> 20:50.911
This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.

20:51.203 --> 20:55.875
Check this out. He must have been
the King of the Wicker People.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.213
Where'd this come from?

20:59.422 --> 21:01.216
I have no idea.

21:02.718 --> 21:04.220
It's Japanese.

21:04.595 --> 21:05.930
How do you know?

21:06.931 --> 21:08.600
I bought it in Japan.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.272
- Who are you?
- Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.358
Alexander Knox.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.113
I read your work. I like it a lot.

21:19.405 --> 21:21.324
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

21:22.284 --> 21:23.619
Vicki Vale.

21:25.329 --> 21:26.247
Bruce Wayne.

21:26.330 --> 21:27.833
Are you sure?

21:27.916 --> 21:31.796
Yeah. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't I?

21:33.798 --> 21:35.593
You've got a wonderful eye.

21:35.801 --> 21:37.803
Some people think she has two.

21:38.596 --> 21:41.933
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.813
We need more champagne.
Is that all right?

21:46.147 --> 21:47.816
Sure. Go ahead.

21:48.942 --> 21:51.571
How many cases? Six? Six?

21:51.821 --> 21:53.239
Six is good.

21:57.078 --> 21:59.081
Will you be in Gotham for a while?

21:59.164 --> 22:03.836
I'd love to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's "giant bat" stories.

22:04.337 --> 22:06.590
Oh, right. The bat... Batman.

22:09.093 --> 22:11.846
A bit light after the war
in Corto Maltese, no?

22:12.514 --> 22:14.433
What do you do for a living?

22:15.601 --> 22:18.355
Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.110
Very unexpectedly, sir.

22:23.694 --> 22:25.405
Will you two excuse me?

22:25.614 --> 22:28.283
I think perhaps this way, sir.

22:28.867 --> 22:33.707
They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.

22:36.127 --> 22:37.796
And give Knox a grant.

22:42.468 --> 22:44.429
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.056
The rich...

22:46.306 --> 22:49.561
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.

22:49.978 --> 22:51.479
Look at this mirror.

22:51.563 --> 22:53.566
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

23:32.364 --> 23:35.117
- What's up?
- Anonymous tip.

23:35.368 --> 23:37.704
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

23:37.871 --> 23:41.042
If we could get him, we'd have Grissom.

23:42.126 --> 23:44.463
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

23:44.713 --> 23:47.300
- Eckhardt.
- Oh, my God!

23:47.550 --> 23:49.135
Come on, let's go.

24:04.655 --> 24:06.241
Get a good look.

24:07.242 --> 24:09.911
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?

24:11.414 --> 24:13.165
Let's move out.

24:46.374 --> 24:48.710
We've been ratted out, boys.

24:48.961 --> 24:50.045
Watch it.

24:56.386 --> 24:57.555
Freeze!

25:15.577 --> 25:17.914
You take the right. Move it.

25:18.915 --> 25:20.709
What the hell's going on?

25:20.834 --> 25:25.173
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.

25:26.674 --> 25:30.679
<i>This is Commissioner Gordon.</i>
<i>I want him taken alive.</i>

25:30.930 --> 25:35.686
<i>I repeat. Any man who opens fire</i>
<i>on Jack Napier will answer to me.</i>

26:23.538 --> 26:24.998
Let me down!

26:25.833 --> 26:27.501
Let me down!

26:29.880 --> 26:31.089
Let me down!

26:32.549 --> 26:34.051
Oh, my God!

27:43.264 --> 27:45.599
Get up on the catwalk, on that side.

27:45.808 --> 27:48.311
You take that side. Be very careful.

28:03.581 --> 28:04.540
Jesus!

28:06.835 --> 28:09.754
Let him go... or I'll do Gordon.

28:22.021 --> 28:23.230
Nice outfit.

28:36.038 --> 28:38.124
Come on, Jack, let's go!

28:44.965 --> 28:46.301
Come on!

28:48.053 --> 28:49.138
Eckhardt!

28:51.641 --> 28:53.352
Think about the future.

29:36.781 --> 29:39.117
Goddamn it, we had him!

29:39.952 --> 29:41.954
Hold it right there!

29:55.889 --> 29:58.558
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

30:00.561 --> 30:03.231
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.

30:26.093 --> 30:30.432
If there's no Bat,
then who dropped Napier into the acid?

30:30.766 --> 30:33.937
Suicide? I want to get this on tape.

30:35.772 --> 30:38.651
He hung up. What have you got?

30:38.943 --> 30:40.611
Here's the inner city.

30:40.778 --> 30:42.697
Here's the sightings so far.

30:42.989 --> 30:46.619
Maybe Batman has some
sort of flight pattern.

30:46.827 --> 30:51.124
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.962
No can do. I got a date. Bruce Wayne.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.297
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

30:56.631 --> 30:59.301
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.

30:59.635 --> 31:01.805
Thanks for being so concerned.

31:17.032 --> 31:18.325
How's the soup?

31:19.869 --> 31:21.329
Excuse me?

31:22.706 --> 31:25.042
The soup. How is it?

31:26.002 --> 31:27.837
It's great.

31:33.052 --> 31:34.762
Could you pass the salt?

31:54.913 --> 31:57.291
Did you have trouble finding the house?

31:59.252 --> 32:01.087
- It was no problem.
- Good.

32:06.010 --> 32:07.846
Do you like eating in here?

32:15.940 --> 32:18.777
I don't think I've been in this room before.

32:21.780 --> 32:23.199
You want to leave?

32:23.532 --> 32:24.700
Yes.

32:32.710 --> 32:35.047
There was young Master Bruce...

32:35.381 --> 32:38.301
...leading his gray pony
with me on its back...

32:38.552 --> 32:43.140
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

32:44.225 --> 32:48.230
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

32:49.482 --> 32:52.402
I think I've embarrassed
him for long enough.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.905
I'm off to bed.

32:55.573 --> 32:58.827
Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

33:08.923 --> 33:12.176
He's really wonderful. He loves you a lot.

33:12.427 --> 33:16.265
Alfred's great.
I couldn't find my socks without him.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.853
He reminds me of my grandfather.

33:21.105 --> 33:22.732
Were you close to him?

33:23.024 --> 33:25.944
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.

33:26.028 --> 33:30.700
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

33:31.451 --> 33:32.870
...it was fun.

33:33.621 --> 33:35.205
That sounds nice.

33:37.959 --> 33:39.628
What about your family?

33:41.881 --> 33:44.301
Actually, Alfred is my family.

33:48.223 --> 33:52.311
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.

33:55.398 --> 33:57.567
Some of it is very much me.

33:59.237 --> 34:00.571
Some isn't.

34:02.156 --> 34:04.993
That dining room is definitely not you.

34:05.327 --> 34:06.955
The dining room isn't.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.069
Let's see how we did.

34:52.636 --> 34:54.306
Oh, my God!

34:54.806 --> 34:55.806
Mirror.

34:58.102 --> 34:59.145
Mirror!

35:08.615 --> 35:12.787
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed.

35:18.002 --> 35:20.964
You see what I have to work with here.

35:42.950 --> 35:45.787
There are an awful lot of stairs
in this place.

35:46.037 --> 35:47.873
My feet are killing me.

35:56.550 --> 35:59.554
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

35:59.805 --> 36:01.556
One drink and I'm flying.

36:02.557 --> 36:04.727
Why are you afraid of flying?

36:35.349 --> 36:37.184
That you, sugar bumps?

36:38.770 --> 36:40.439
Who are you?

36:41.356 --> 36:42.859
It's me.

36:43.359 --> 36:45.028
"Sugar bumps."

36:50.368 --> 36:52.787
You're alive! I heard you'd been...

36:53.038 --> 36:54.123
Fried?

36:54.790 --> 36:56.459
Is that what you heard?

36:56.876 --> 36:59.046
You set me up over a woman.

37:00.297 --> 37:01.799
A woman!

37:02.550 --> 37:04.552
You must be insane.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.405
Don't bother.

37:21.574 --> 37:24.160
Your life won't be worth spit!

37:25.579 --> 37:27.915
I've been dead once already.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.168
It's very liberating...

37:30.585 --> 37:33.589
...if you think of it as... therapy.

37:35.591 --> 37:37.427
Jack, listen.

37:40.098 --> 37:42.100
Maybe we can cut a deal.

37:43.351 --> 37:44.520
Jack?

37:45.437 --> 37:47.774
Jack is dead, my friend.

37:48.608 --> 37:50.276
You can call me...

37:50.610 --> 37:51.696
...Joker.

37:53.030 --> 37:54.699
As you can see...

37:54.949 --> 37:56.618
...I'm a lot happier.

38:21.482 --> 38:23.485
Oh, what a day.

39:18.888 --> 39:20.556
Gotham City.

39:23.394 --> 39:26.773
It always brings a smile to my face.

39:31.779 --> 39:33.782
"Winged Freak...

39:35.784 --> 39:37.453
"...Terrorizes..."

39:41.083 --> 39:43.377
Wait'll they get a load of me.

39:58.813 --> 40:03.235
I've got an idea. How about lunch at
my place? I'll show you some photos.

40:03.486 --> 40:04.988
Sure. Okay.

40:05.238 --> 40:08.576
Wait a minute. No, I can't. I can't make it.

40:09.577 --> 40:11.747
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

40:11.997 --> 40:16.419
I can't make it then, either.
I've got a very important meeting today.

40:17.670 --> 40:19.173
What's wrong?

40:20.174 --> 40:21.258
Nothing.

40:22.426 --> 40:24.846
I have to leave town for a few days.

40:25.347 --> 40:27.600
Okay, we'll do it when you get back.

40:28.351 --> 40:30.437
I have to go. I'm late.

40:46.791 --> 40:50.128
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you, too.

40:51.296 --> 40:54.217
I'll talk to you guys when you get back.

40:54.467 --> 40:57.387
Back, Miss Vale?
We'll be here for quite a while.

41:11.321 --> 41:14.492
You'll never believe what
happened to me today.

41:28.552 --> 41:33.224
<i>So, gentlemen, that's how it is.</i>
<i>Until Grissom... resurfaces...</i>

41:33.641 --> 41:35.476
<i>... I'm the acting president.</i>

41:35.560 --> 41:39.064
<i>And I say, starting with</i>
<i>this anniversary festival...</i>

41:39.314 --> 41:41.526
<i>... we run this city into the ground.</i>

41:41.651 --> 41:43.820
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

41:43.903 --> 41:45.072
Yeah.

41:45.823 --> 41:48.160
And what's with that stupid grin?

41:49.745 --> 41:51.831
Life's been good to me.

41:55.836 --> 41:57.588
What if we say "no"?

42:02.761 --> 42:04.930
Nobody wants a war.

42:05.681 --> 42:10.103
If we can't do business,
we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.

42:10.604 --> 42:11.522
Yeah?

42:21.951 --> 42:23.788
I got a live one here.

42:30.963 --> 42:35.135
There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight.

42:52.824 --> 42:55.911
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.

42:57.413 --> 42:58.707
You're crazy.

43:01.334 --> 43:04.839
Haven't you ever heard of the
healing power of laughter?

43:12.265 --> 43:15.144
- Now get out of here!
- Let's go! Move it!

43:15.769 --> 43:17.439
You think it over.

43:36.128 --> 43:40.175
Go to the <i>Globe</i>, follow that reporter Knox.
Take your camera.

43:40.468 --> 43:43.345
See what he knows about this Batman.

43:44.639 --> 43:46.016
And, Bob...

43:49.687 --> 43:52.024
...remember... you...

43:54.359 --> 43:56.071
...are my number one...

43:56.321 --> 43:57.822
guy

43:59.199 --> 44:00.701
Yes, sir.

44:15.678 --> 44:17.347
Your pals...

44:18.181 --> 44:19.975
...they're not bad people.

44:21.060 --> 44:22.728
Maybe we...

44:23.730 --> 44:26.901
...ought to give them a
few days to think it over.

44:27.693 --> 44:28.861
No?

44:34.577 --> 44:36.246
Grease them now?

44:39.208 --> 44:40.543
Okay.

44:42.712 --> 44:45.549
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

44:47.427 --> 44:49.262
I'm glad you're dead.

44:56.688 --> 44:58.524
I'm glad you're dead.

45:01.444 --> 45:04.197
I'm glad you're dead.

45:11.123 --> 45:12.708
I need that.

45:13.626 --> 45:15.378
I'm losing confidence in you.

45:15.462 --> 45:17.214
I thought we were a team.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.967
Is this a personal issue for you?

45:20.718 --> 45:22.387
I just want you to do your job.

45:22.471 --> 45:23.930
I am doing my job.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.808
And I'm protecting my partner.

45:25.892 --> 45:29.730
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?

45:29.980 --> 45:31.565
Who cares?

45:33.651 --> 45:36.488
Forget Bruce Wayne. I'm onto Batman.

47:28.212 --> 47:31.841
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.

47:40.268 --> 47:42.188
What is this affidavit you filed?

47:42.271 --> 47:44.273
Grissom gave you his business?

47:44.566 --> 47:47.444
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...

47:47.778 --> 47:50.949
...to take over all his
businesses until he returns.

47:51.616 --> 47:55.621
That's a big favor.
You two must have been very close.

47:55.913 --> 47:58.250
Did you do time together as children?

48:41.345 --> 48:45.017
Our accountants are looking into it.
The affidavit is legitimate.

48:51.192 --> 48:53.694
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?

48:53.986 --> 48:55.655
Of course you can.

48:55.864 --> 48:58.993
We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is legitimate.

48:59.160 --> 49:00.536
It is legitimate.

49:01.662 --> 49:03.791
I saw it. I was there.

49:04.374 --> 49:05.960
I saw it all.

49:06.211 --> 49:08.797
He reached up with his dead hand...

49:09.130 --> 49:11.550
...and signed it in his own blood.

49:11.884 --> 49:14.888
And he did it... with this pen.

49:16.139 --> 49:18.810
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

49:20.311 --> 49:21.939
Time to pay the check.

49:28.238 --> 49:29.573
The pen...

49:30.074 --> 49:32.326
...is truly mightier than the sword.

49:48.848 --> 49:49.932
Get down!

50:09.456 --> 50:13.628
<i>Won't this gang war dampen</i>
<i>the city's 200th anniversary?</i>

50:13.879 --> 50:17.717
<i>The festival opens.</i>
<i>The police will stop these gangsters.</i>

50:18.968 --> 50:22.973
<i>What about the theory that</i>
<i>the Batman is a Mob enforcer?</i>

50:23.223 --> 50:24.976
<i>I don't have any comment.</i>

50:30.649 --> 50:31.985
Batman.

50:32.986 --> 50:34.488
Batman.

50:35.490 --> 50:39.411
Can somebody tell me what
kind of a world we live in...

50:39.661 --> 50:42.665
...when a man dressed as a <i>bat</i>...

50:42.916 --> 50:45.001
...gets all my press?

50:47.421 --> 50:49.423
This town needs an enema!

50:56.992 --> 50:58.994
May I have a glass of... water?

51:00.830 --> 51:02.832
I'm relieved that you're home.

51:03.083 --> 51:07.088
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

51:07.422 --> 51:10.926
I feel there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

51:12.094 --> 51:13.179
Alfred...

51:13.930 --> 51:15.766
...why don't you marry her?

51:16.266 --> 51:19.437
That's not exactly what I had in mind, sir.

51:25.861 --> 51:28.031
I can't go on with that right now.

51:28.448 --> 51:30.116
If not now...

51:32.870 --> 51:33.871
...when?

51:37.668 --> 51:38.919
I don't know.

51:43.175 --> 51:45.344
Jack Napier's still alive.

51:48.348 --> 51:52.478
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.

52:04.869 --> 52:06.537
She is great, isn't she?

52:07.330 --> 52:08.373
Yes.

52:20.013 --> 52:21.014
<i>Knox.</i>

52:22.015 --> 52:23.851
Check something out for me.

52:24.685 --> 52:27.814
Find out what's special about
the alley at Pearl and Phillips.

52:27.898 --> 52:29.566
<i>Pearl and Phillips?</i>

52:30.025 --> 52:31.194
<i>You got it.</i>

52:41.206 --> 52:42.540
Mister Wayne.

53:06.779 --> 53:09.074
So much to do and so little time.

53:09.282 --> 53:10.909
The photos.

53:13.246 --> 53:14.956
Who's that loss?

53:15.248 --> 53:16.250
Knox.

53:16.458 --> 53:18.794
Bad tie. No style.

53:21.881 --> 53:23.551
Stop the press!

53:23.801 --> 53:25.803
- Who is that?
- Vicki Vale.

53:26.053 --> 53:28.223
The photographer working with Knox.

53:28.306 --> 53:30.559
That girl has style.

53:30.892 --> 53:32.562
Jesus marimba!

53:32.895 --> 53:35.566
A lovely beast like that running around...

53:35.816 --> 53:38.318
...could put steam in a man's strides.

53:38.569 --> 53:40.822
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

53:41.072 --> 53:42.907
She's about to trade up.

53:44.076 --> 53:46.662
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

53:50.917 --> 53:52.336
I'm about...

53:54.005 --> 53:56.008
...to get a new girl.

53:57.593 --> 54:00.263
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

54:01.264 --> 54:02.432
Phone book.

54:06.770 --> 54:08.940
So much to do...

54:09.858 --> 54:11.611
...and so little time.

54:37.142 --> 54:39.395
Have you shipped a million of those?

54:40.563 --> 54:45.069
Ship them all! We're going to
take them out a whole new door!

54:48.490 --> 54:50.408
Ten seconds to transmission.

54:52.745 --> 54:54.914
Five... four... three... two... one.

54:59.086 --> 55:00.672
Cue music.

55:03.341 --> 55:04.843
Cue Becky.

55:08.098 --> 55:11.435
Good evening.
The fashion world was stunned today...

55:11.686 --> 55:15.440
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

55:15.858 --> 55:19.863
<i>Cause of death has been attributed</i>
<i>to a violent allergic reaction...</i>

55:20.113 --> 55:24.785
<i>... although authorities have not</i>
<i>ruled out the possibility of drug use.</i>

55:25.953 --> 55:28.790
<i>Plans continue for the</i>
<i>city's 200th birthday...</i>

55:29.040 --> 55:32.128
<i>... as Mayor Borg announced today,</i>
<i>the unveiling</i>...

55:32.545 --> 55:34.130
<i>This just in.</i>

55:35.131 --> 55:37.968
<i>Three mysterious deaths</i>
<i>at a beauty parlor</i>...

55:42.390 --> 55:44.602
<i>... were discovered today.</i>

55:46.896 --> 55:48.315
<i>What's going on?</i>

55:49.566 --> 55:51.234
<i>This is hardly the...</i>

55:55.072 --> 55:56.366
Kill the camera.

55:56.450 --> 56:00.747
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!

56:06.253 --> 56:09.090
<i>New and improved Joker products!</i>

56:09.299 --> 56:11.259
<i>With a new secret ingredient.</i>

56:11.969 --> 56:13.304
<i>Smylex!</i>

56:13.471 --> 56:14.805
What's that?

56:15.097 --> 56:17.434
<i>Let's go over...</i>

56:18.143 --> 56:20.480
<i>... to our blind taste-test.</i>

56:20.647 --> 56:22.315
<i>Love that Joker.</i>

56:22.607 --> 56:24.985
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know.

56:26.820 --> 56:30.909
<i>He doesn't look happy.</i>
<i>He's been using brand X.</i>

56:33.287 --> 56:35.832
<i>But with new Joker Brand...</i>

56:36.166 --> 56:38.293
<i>... I get a grin again...</i>

56:38.627 --> 56:40.129
<i>... and again.</i>

56:41.631 --> 56:43.466
<i>That luscious tan...</i>

56:43.968 --> 56:45.636
<i>... those ruby lips...</i>

56:45.844 --> 56:50.475
<i>... and hair color so natural,</i>
<i>only your undertaker knows for sure.</i>

56:52.019 --> 56:53.479
<i>You're saying:</i>

56:53.688 --> 56:56.984
<i>"Where can I get these fine, new items?"</i>

56:57.192 --> 57:01.656
<i>That's the gag. Chances are,</i>
<i>you've bought them already!</i>

57:02.657 --> 57:04.368
<i>Love that Joker.</i>

57:04.702 --> 57:06.036
<i>Remember...</i>

57:06.328 --> 57:09.332
<i>... put on a happy face.</i>

57:13.879 --> 57:15.883
The information you requested.

57:24.351 --> 57:27.521
"Jack Napier, assault with
a deadly weapon, age 15.

57:27.731 --> 57:30.358
"Results of psychological profile...

57:30.901 --> 57:34.655
"...violent mood swings, highly intelligent,
emotionally unstable.

57:35.489 --> 57:38.744
"Aptitudes include science,
chemistry, and art."

57:40.997 --> 57:42.332
Chemistry.

57:48.924 --> 57:50.383
Let's go shopping.

58:00.021 --> 58:04.860
...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

58:06.111 --> 58:08.114
And what is the pattern?

58:08.531 --> 58:12.453
Foods, alcohol,
or beauty and hygiene products?

58:12.787 --> 58:16.458
Cologne, mouthwash, underarm deodorant?

58:16.792 --> 58:19.628
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.

58:20.296 --> 58:23.968
The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.

58:24.635 --> 58:29.474
We are having a festival, if I have to
use a gun to get people there myself.

58:29.724 --> 58:33.646
Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!

58:33.896 --> 58:36.900
Find out what this madman
is poisoning us with.

58:37.150 --> 58:38.569
Do you read me?

58:40.154 --> 58:43.324
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.

58:47.496 --> 58:49.666
<i>Hi, it's Vicki.</i>

58:49.916 --> 58:52.503
<i>I'll be ten minutes late to the museum.</i>

58:52.753 --> 58:54.839
<i>I'll see you when you get there.</i>

59:01.014 --> 59:03.349
A message from Miss Vale.

59:03.683 --> 59:06.353
She'll be late meeting you at the museum.

59:06.937 --> 59:09.608
Okay, thank you. Wait a minute, Alfred.

59:10.191 --> 59:11.986
I'm not meeting her today.

59:23.291 --> 59:25.711
Jack, where are you going?

59:28.131 --> 59:30.800
Daddy's going to make some art, darling.

01:00:05.511 --> 01:00:07.513
Mr. Wayne's table?

01:00:07.847 --> 01:00:10.350
He hasn't arrived yet.

01:00:10.725 --> 01:00:12.395
We have a table waiting.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:40.430
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:44.843
Gentlemen!

01:01:45.344 --> 01:01:48.181
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:10.959
Give him a shave.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.463
Terence, brush.

01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:10.033
The one-dollar bill.

01:03:14.288 --> 01:03:15.289
Hold it!

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.211
I kind of like this one. Leave it.

01:03:33.646 --> 01:03:35.564
You can take that off now.

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:42.240
You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:46.078
But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.

01:03:49.666 --> 01:03:51.084
Your portfolio?

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:55.589
I'm meeting someone
who wants to see my work.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.261
Crap.

01:03:59.678 --> 01:04:01.514
Crap. Crap.

01:04:02.682 --> 01:04:04.435
Crap. Crap.

01:04:07.938 --> 01:04:09.774
Now that's good work.

01:04:13.195 --> 01:04:14.864
The skulls, the bodies.

01:04:15.281 --> 01:04:19.703
You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:24.501
Let me tell you what I'm thinking about.

01:04:24.793 --> 01:04:26.712
I was in the bath one day...

01:04:26.837 --> 01:04:30.633
...when I realized why I
was destined for greatness.

01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:34.347
You know how concerned people
are about appearances.

01:04:34.805 --> 01:04:37.309
This is attractive, that is not.

01:04:37.642 --> 01:04:41.856
That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.

01:04:42.482 --> 01:04:45.152
I make art... until someone dies.

01:04:45.527 --> 01:04:46.653
See?

01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:52.495
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.

01:04:54.872 --> 01:04:56.291
What do you want?

01:04:58.001 --> 01:05:00.045
My face on the one-dollar bill.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.716
You're joking.

01:05:04.885 --> 01:05:06.679
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:05:07.513 --> 01:05:08.515
No.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:10.058
Listen.

01:05:10.558 --> 01:05:15.064
We mustn't compare ourselves to
regular people. We're artists.

01:05:15.398 --> 01:05:18.735
For instance, let me challenge you
with a piece I did.

01:05:19.027 --> 01:05:21.197
Bob. Alicia.

01:05:22.031 --> 01:05:24.535
You will photograph and record my work.

01:05:24.743 --> 01:05:29.082
You will join me in the
avant-garde of the new aesthetic.

01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:33.879
Jack, you said I could watch
you improve the paintings.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.717
I'm in trouble now.

01:05:37.426 --> 01:05:39.428
Why is she wearing a mask?

01:05:40.388 --> 01:05:42.181
She's just a sketch, really.

01:05:42.265 --> 01:05:45.936
Alicia, sit down. Show the lady
why you wear this mask.

01:05:46.228 --> 01:05:50.108
Alicia's been made over in
line with my new philosophy.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.943
So now, like me...

01:05:52.277 --> 01:05:54.572
...she is a living work of art.

01:05:58.952 --> 01:06:01.456
I'm no Picasso, but... do you like it?

01:06:02.957 --> 01:06:04.208
It's great.

01:06:05.377 --> 01:06:08.047
So... what can I do for you?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:11.468
A little song, a little dance.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.804
Batman's head on a lance.

01:06:14.055 --> 01:06:16.140
What do you know about...?

01:06:16.892 --> 01:06:19.102
I don't know anything about Batman.

01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:21.564
Really?

01:06:22.148 --> 01:06:24.485
Well, how about a little "you and me"?

01:06:27.154 --> 01:06:28.406
You're insane.

01:06:28.656 --> 01:06:30.867
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

01:06:30.992 --> 01:06:33.662
Let's make up. Have a little...

01:06:33.913 --> 01:06:35.748
...whiff of my posy.

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:43.007
Help me!

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:45.344
I'm melting!

01:06:46.095 --> 01:06:48.848
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:13.963
Hold on.

01:07:23.141 --> 01:07:26.145
Where does he get those wonderful toys?

01:07:29.065 --> 01:07:30.900
- Get in the car.
- Which one?

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:57.634
Let's go.

01:09:12.737 --> 01:09:13.738
Shields.

01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:40.729
How much do you weigh?

01:09:40.938 --> 01:09:42.607
About 10 <i>8</i>, I think.

01:09:51.701 --> 01:09:52.953
Hold on.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:05.636
Grab that thing on my belt.

01:10:06.053 --> 01:10:07.304
Don't let go.

01:10:22.073 --> 01:10:23.157
No blood.

01:10:23.324 --> 01:10:24.827
Who is this guy?

01:10:24.993 --> 01:10:26.412
Check his wallet.

01:10:27.746 --> 01:10:30.333
- Wait.
- What is that?

01:10:30.583 --> 01:10:34.171
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

01:10:34.505 --> 01:10:35.965
Take off the mask.

01:10:42.098 --> 01:10:43.182
Shoot her!

01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:47.387
Shields open.

01:12:12.418 --> 01:12:14.213
You weigh more than 10 <i>8</i>.

01:12:14.421 --> 01:12:16.465
- Really?
- Let's go.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.056
Stop.

01:12:50.925 --> 01:12:52.469
Where are we going?

01:14:12.068 --> 01:14:13.487
Be careful.

01:14:22.415 --> 01:14:23.583
Bats.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.879
They're great survivors.

01:14:52.202 --> 01:14:55.122
- What is all this?
- The police have got it wrong.

01:14:55.789 --> 01:14:57.876
They're looking for one product.

01:14:58.126 --> 01:15:01.297
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:06.136
Then whole shipments would be poisoned.

01:15:06.386 --> 01:15:08.055
And we'd all be dead.

01:15:09.057 --> 01:15:10.558
No.

01:15:10.808 --> 01:15:15.481
The poison only works if the components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:20.237
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.

01:15:20.904 --> 01:15:23.074
How did you figure this out?

01:15:29.082 --> 01:15:30.792
Take that to the press.

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.921
I might have trouble with that.

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:38.134
A lot of people think you're
as dangerous as the Joker.

01:15:39.469 --> 01:15:41.138
He's psychotic.

01:15:42.265 --> 01:15:44.976
Some people say the same thing
about you.

01:15:46.144 --> 01:15:47.312
What people?

01:15:48.313 --> 01:15:50.483
Well, let's face it.

01:15:51.943 --> 01:15:55.114
You're not exactly normal... are you?

01:15:55.823 --> 01:15:57.909
It's not exactly a normal world.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.953
Why did you bring me here?

01:16:00.287 --> 01:16:03.624
You could have sent that
stuff to the press yourself.

01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:05.544
You're right.

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.632
There is something else you have
that I want.

01:16:09.841 --> 01:16:10.967
What?

01:16:33.162 --> 01:16:34.997
He took the film.

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:44.008
Where have you been? Are you okay?
Should I come over?

01:16:44.217 --> 01:16:46.345
No, Allie.

01:16:47.012 --> 01:16:50.517
If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.729
Just barely. Is it hot?

01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.066
Yeah, it's real hot.

01:16:59.236 --> 01:17:00.237
Copy!

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.755
<i>Avoid the following combinations:</i>

01:17:14.838 --> 01:17:18.343
<i>Deodorants with baby powder,</i>
<i>hairspray, and lipstick.</i>

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:23.182
<i>Safe products are flying in</i>
<i>as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.</i>

01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:26.603
<i>And all of Gotham is wondering</i>
<i>what to make of Batman.</i>

01:17:26.854 --> 01:17:28.522
<i>Friend or foe?</i>

01:17:30.108 --> 01:17:32.443
I have given a name to my pain...

01:17:33.612 --> 01:17:35.614
...and it is Batman.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.958
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:46.879
We've got a flying mouse to kill...

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:49.799
...and I want to clean my claws.

01:17:54.722 --> 01:17:57.392
<i>Sir, Miss Vale called again.</i>

01:17:57.809 --> 01:18:00.854
<i>Dare I suggest that your</i>
<i>present course of action...</i>

01:18:01.146 --> 01:18:03.524
<i>... might simply strengthen her resolve?</i>

01:18:03.816 --> 01:18:05.986
She is quite tenacious.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.071
You're right.

01:18:08.197 --> 01:18:12.702
And quite special.
Perhaps you could try telling her the truth.

01:18:23.341 --> 01:18:24.675
Coming.

01:18:38.735 --> 01:18:39.986
May I come in?

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.668
This is a nice apartment.

01:18:53.754 --> 01:18:55.256
Lots of space.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.557
Listen, I came over to...

01:19:02.932 --> 01:19:05.727
...clear...
- I don't know who you think you are!

01:19:05.936 --> 01:19:07.604
- You hurt me.
- I know.

01:19:07.896 --> 01:19:12.569
I called you and called you. And you lied!
You lied about leaving town.

01:19:12.735 --> 01:19:15.072
- Let me tell you why.
- Let me tell you!

01:19:15.281 --> 01:19:18.785
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.

01:19:19.077 --> 01:19:20.745
I even slept with you.

01:19:20.912 --> 01:19:24.584
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:29.632
You're a real nice girl and I like you a lot,
but right now, shut up.

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.927
I have something to tell you.

01:19:41.062 --> 01:19:45.401
You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?

01:19:47.237 --> 01:19:48.739
Sometimes...

01:19:49.574 --> 01:19:53.579
...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.

01:19:54.163 --> 01:19:55.998
Oh, my God, you're married.

01:19:56.498 --> 01:19:58.335
No, I'm not married.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:06.678
You see...

01:20:08.096 --> 01:20:10.350
...my life is really...

01:20:13.687 --> 01:20:14.855
...complex.

01:20:18.026 --> 01:20:22.698
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:26.119
...goes downstairs...

01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:28.205
...and eats breakfast...

01:20:28.538 --> 01:20:32.043
...and kisses somebody good-bye,
and goes to...

01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:35.047
...a job, and, you know...

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:37.216
No.

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:42.390
Look.

01:20:46.061 --> 01:20:48.397
What I'm trying to tell you is...

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:52.318
Hey, it's okay.

01:20:52.569 --> 01:20:54.071
You can tell me.

01:20:59.327 --> 01:21:01.496
What I'm trying to tell you is...

01:21:04.417 --> 01:21:06.086
I'll be right back.

01:21:17.016 --> 01:21:18.184
Miss me?

01:21:23.858 --> 01:21:27.195
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

01:21:28.614 --> 01:21:31.117
Vicki, we've really got to talk.

01:21:35.122 --> 01:21:36.957
We were having dinner.

01:21:37.876 --> 01:21:41.212
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

01:21:41.797 --> 01:21:44.300
And without so much as an apology...

01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:48.347
...you ran off with that sideshow phony.

01:21:53.561 --> 01:21:54.730
You know...

01:21:56.982 --> 01:21:59.903
...I've recently had a tragedy in my life.

01:22:00.153 --> 01:22:01.571
Alicia...

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.825
...threw herself out a window.

01:22:05.076 --> 01:22:06.245
Oh, my God.

01:22:08.914 --> 01:22:10.250
But...

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:13.921
...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

01:22:25.309 --> 01:22:26.937
Well, Miss Vale...

01:22:27.646 --> 01:22:30.316
...another rooster in the hen-house?

01:22:33.152 --> 01:22:36.156
Take thy beak from out my heart.

01:22:42.498 --> 01:22:45.626
Bruce... Wayne, <i>n'est-ce pas</i> ?

01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:49.423
Most of the time.

01:22:55.681 --> 01:22:57.182
I know who you are.

01:23:00.353 --> 01:23:02.982
Let me tell you about this guy I know.

01:23:03.858 --> 01:23:07.195
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

01:23:07.696 --> 01:23:09.531
I like him already.

01:23:12.869 --> 01:23:15.164
You know what the problem was?

01:23:15.497 --> 01:23:18.501
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

01:23:18.835 --> 01:23:23.174
He started to lose it.
He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.

01:23:23.382 --> 01:23:25.886
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.514
He was the kind of guy who...

01:23:30.725 --> 01:23:34.063
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.

01:23:38.735 --> 01:23:40.946
You know what happened to this guy?

01:23:45.744 --> 01:23:47.704
He made mistakes.

01:23:49.206 --> 01:23:52.919
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?

01:23:53.211 --> 01:23:54.964
Come on! Let's get nuts!

01:23:56.423 --> 01:23:57.926
Tell me something.

01:23:59.678 --> 01:24:03.015
Have you ever danced with the
devil in the pale moonlight?

01:24:03.265 --> 01:24:04.183
What?

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.270
I always ask that of all my prey.

01:24:07.938 --> 01:24:09.857
I just like the sound of it.

01:24:15.948 --> 01:24:18.451
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

01:24:25.543 --> 01:24:29.298
Why is it, every time I come for you...

01:24:30.383 --> 01:24:32.635
...somebody always gets in the way?

01:24:32.969 --> 01:24:35.139
I'll need a moment alone.

01:24:37.976 --> 01:24:40.645
I'm only laughing on the outside.

01:24:41.563 --> 01:24:44.650
My smile is just skin deep.

01:24:45.818 --> 01:24:47.612
If you could see inside...

01:24:47.821 --> 01:24:49.823
...I'm really crying.

01:24:50.825 --> 01:24:52.994
You might join me for a weep.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.970
You really wouldn't believe it.

01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:45.142
While you were entertaining, I've been
finding out about your street corner.

01:25:49.147 --> 01:25:51.651
I think your friend is screwed up.

01:25:52.568 --> 01:25:54.154
More good news.

01:26:02.248 --> 01:26:03.916
Oh, my God!

01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:06.920
His parents were murdered in that alley.

01:26:07.671 --> 01:26:09.673
That's why he went there.

01:26:14.263 --> 01:26:16.932
He watched it happen in front of him.

01:26:17.433 --> 01:26:19.394
Look at the look on his face.

01:26:19.853 --> 01:26:22.189
It was the same at City Hall.

01:26:23.774 --> 01:26:26.361
What do you suppose this does to a kid?

01:26:32.076 --> 01:26:34.079
Don't get personal!

01:26:48.013 --> 01:26:50.224
Did you get the file on my parents?

01:26:50.683 --> 01:26:52.352
It's on your table.

01:27:01.112 --> 01:27:02.782
What's on your mind?

01:27:04.867 --> 01:27:08.872
I have no wish to fill my
few remaining years...

01:27:09.289 --> 01:27:11.876
...grieving for the loss of old friends...

01:27:15.881 --> 01:27:17.716
...or their sons.

01:27:35.906 --> 01:27:40.578
<i>The 200th anniversary birthday gala</i>
<i>has been indefinitely postponed.</i>

01:27:41.079 --> 01:27:43.207
<i>We cannot guarantee public safety.</i>

01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:44.959
<i>Joker here.</i>

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:46.837
We got interference.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.425
<i>Now you fellows have said</i>
<i>some pretty mean things.</i>

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:54.096
<i>Some of which</i> were <i>true under that fiend...</i>

01:27:54.304 --> 01:27:55.639
<i>... Boss Grissom.</i>

01:27:55.931 --> 01:27:58.768
<i>He was a thief... and a terrorist.</i>

01:27:58.977 --> 01:28:02.648
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>he had a tremendous singing voice.</i>

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:06.778
<i>He's dead now, and he's left me in charge.</i>

01:28:10.116 --> 01:28:12.452
<i>I can be theatrical...</i>

01:28:12.785 --> 01:28:15.289
<i>... and maybe even a little rough.</i>

01:28:15.789 --> 01:28:18.168
<i>But one thing I am not...</i>

01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:20.003
<i>... is a killer!</i>

01:28:24.675 --> 01:28:26.345
<i>I love a good party.</i>

01:28:26.636 --> 01:28:28.180
<i>So, truce.</i>

01:28:28.805 --> 01:28:31.684
<i>Commence au festival!</i>

01:28:33.019 --> 01:28:36.023
<i>And I've got a surprise for Gotham City.</i>

01:28:37.024 --> 01:28:41.154
<i>At midnight, I will dump</i>
<i>20 million in cash...</i>

01:28:41.654 --> 01:28:42.990
<i>... on the crowd.</i>

01:28:46.161 --> 01:28:48.538
<i>Don't worry about me. I've got enough.</i>

01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:51.876
<i>We are not prepared to discuss any deals.</i>

01:28:54.338 --> 01:28:56.673
<i>You heard it, folks, 20 million.</i>

01:28:57.383 --> 01:28:59.469
<i>And there will be entertainment.</i>

01:28:59.969 --> 01:29:04.642
<i>The big dukeroo. With me in one corner,</i>
<i>and in the other corner...</i>

01:29:05.226 --> 01:29:09.481
<i>... the man who has brought</i>
<i>real terror to Gotham City...</i>

01:29:09.898 --> 01:29:11.401
<i>... Batman.</i>

01:29:11.901 --> 01:29:13.403
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:15.572
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

01:29:15.823 --> 01:29:17.825
<i>Mano y mano.</i>

01:29:18.827 --> 01:29:21.246
<i>I have taken off my make-up.</i>

01:29:22.248 --> 01:29:23.833
<i>Let's see...</i>

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:27.003
<i>... if you can take off yours.</i>

01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:41.212
Tell me, kid.

01:31:41.713 --> 01:31:46.218
Have you ever danced with the
devil by the pale moonlight?

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.564
Let's go!

01:31:58.526 --> 01:32:00.195
Let's go, Jack!

01:32:03.866 --> 01:32:05.409
See you around.

01:32:35.239 --> 01:32:37.074
Am I crazy?

01:32:39.411 --> 01:32:42.623
That wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:49.131
We both got to each other, didn't we?

01:32:52.093 --> 01:32:54.262
Why won't you let me in?

01:32:59.436 --> 01:33:00.937
You got in.

01:33:05.776 --> 01:33:07.821
I've loved you since I met you.

01:33:09.322 --> 01:33:12.660
But I don't know what to think of all this.

01:33:12.952 --> 01:33:17.583
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.

01:33:17.833 --> 01:33:19.169
Why?

01:33:19.753 --> 01:33:21.588
Because nobody else can.

01:33:24.925 --> 01:33:27.763
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.015
This is how it is.

01:33:30.767 --> 01:33:32.518
It's not a perfect world.

01:33:32.769 --> 01:33:35.606
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

01:33:39.778 --> 01:33:43.949
I just have to know,
are we going to try to love each other?

01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:48.789
I'd like to.

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:52.210
But he's out there right now.

01:33:52.710 --> 01:33:54.545
And I've got to go to work.

01:35:37.257 --> 01:35:39.344
<i>Into the air, Junior Birdman!</i>

01:35:39.511 --> 01:35:40.845
<i>Miss me?</i>

01:35:42.347 --> 01:35:44.266
<i>Yeah! Watch me!</i>

01:38:05.526 --> 01:38:08.113
Get them. Take the pictures.

01:38:09.197 --> 01:38:10.532
Gotham's greed.

01:38:39.235 --> 01:38:40.987
<i>And now, folks...</i>

01:38:41.237 --> 01:38:43.657
<i>... it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"</i>

01:38:43.908 --> 01:38:46.577
<i>Money, money! Who do you trust?</i>

01:38:46.827 --> 01:38:49.664
<i>Me? I'm giving away free money.</i>

01:38:50.332 --> 01:38:53.252
<i>And where... is the Batman?</i>

01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:57.674
<i>He's at home, washing his tights.</i>

01:39:05.768 --> 01:39:10.190
Winged battle flies through
the night and finds me ready.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.443
Bob. Mask.

01:39:13.277 --> 01:39:15.239
Masks! Put them on now!

01:39:16.073 --> 01:39:17.574
<i>And now...</i>

01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:20.578
<i>... comes the part...</i>

01:39:21.204 --> 01:39:24.041
<i>... where I relieve you, the little people...</i>

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:26.961
<i>... of the burden... of your failed...</i>

01:39:27.254 --> 01:39:28.964
<i>... and useless lives.</i>

01:39:29.214 --> 01:39:33.219
<i>But, as my plastic surgeon always said,</i>
<i>"If you've got to go...</i>

01:39:33.594 --> 01:39:35.472
<i>"...go with a smile."</i>

01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:07.512
My God.

01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:09.764
Smylex gas.

01:40:10.265 --> 01:40:12.018
He's going to kill everybody!

01:40:12.101 --> 01:40:14.812
Get in the car. Get in the car!

01:40:23.115 --> 01:40:24.408
Hurry!

01:42:16.048 --> 01:42:17.216
My balloons!

01:42:27.896 --> 01:42:29.439
They're my balloons!

01:42:56.181 --> 01:42:58.350
He stole my balloons!

01:42:59.268 --> 01:43:03.440
Why didn't somebody tell me
he had one of those... things?

01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:07.111
Bob. Gun.

01:43:13.619 --> 01:43:16.123
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:18.292
Get out of here!

01:44:10.523 --> 01:44:14.195
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch.
Come to me.

01:45:51.399 --> 01:45:52.735
Darling.

01:45:54.904 --> 01:45:57.824
I've got to get you to the church on time.

01:46:03.582 --> 01:46:07.002
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

01:46:07.252 --> 01:46:09.589
- <i>Right away, sir?</i>
- Five minutes.

01:46:15.012 --> 01:46:16.515
Better make it ten.

01:49:48.321 --> 01:49:49.489
Let's go.

01:49:57.416 --> 01:50:00.753
Point those searchlights at the tower.
Now! Move!

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:35.129
<i>It can be truly said that</i>
<i>I have a bat in my belfry.</i>

01:50:44.516 --> 01:50:45.726
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

01:52:07.745 --> 01:52:09.914
You know, without you...

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:13.627
...I just wouldn't want to go on.

01:53:37.399 --> 01:53:39.901
We were made for each other.

01:53:40.319 --> 01:53:42.488
Beauty and the Beast.

01:53:43.239 --> 01:53:45.993
Of course, if anyone calls you "Beast"...

01:53:46.243 --> 01:53:48.580
...I'll rip their lungs out.

01:54:19.284 --> 01:54:20.787
Mr. Joker?

01:54:24.541 --> 01:54:27.044
You say such beautiful things.

01:54:28.463 --> 01:54:31.549
And you're so powerful. And purple!

01:54:33.386 --> 01:54:34.637
I love purple!

01:54:37.974 --> 01:54:39.142
Excuse me.

01:54:39.643 --> 01:54:42.980
Have you ever danced with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

01:54:46.652 --> 01:54:48.279
I'm going to kill you.

01:54:48.738 --> 01:54:50.407
You idiot!

01:54:50.907 --> 01:54:52.993
You made me, remember?

01:54:53.244 --> 01:54:55.413
You dropped me into the chemicals!

01:54:55.496 --> 01:54:59.668
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.

01:54:59.918 --> 01:55:01.170
I know you did.

01:55:28.997 --> 01:55:30.582
You killed my parents.

01:55:30.665 --> 01:55:31.833
What?

01:55:34.003 --> 01:55:35.546
What are you saying?

01:55:35.838 --> 01:55:38.508
I made you, but you made me first.

01:55:40.135 --> 01:55:41.804
I was just a kid.

01:55:41.971 --> 01:55:44.475
I say you made me, you say I made you.

01:55:44.683 --> 01:55:46.852
How childish can you get?

01:55:47.144 --> 01:55:49.689
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on?

01:56:06.043 --> 01:56:07.878
What are you laughing at?

01:56:15.054 --> 01:56:17.140
Let me lend you a hand.

01:56:25.234 --> 01:56:26.568
Lend you a hand!

01:56:34.245 --> 01:56:36.915
They don't make them like they used to!

01:56:40.837 --> 01:56:42.255
Hey, Batsy!

01:56:55.938 --> 01:56:57.691
There he is! Down there!

01:57:11.666 --> 01:57:13.210
It's time to retire.

01:57:14.795 --> 01:57:17.132
Feel free to drop in.

01:57:26.393 --> 01:57:29.063
Sometimes I just kill myself!

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:35.571
Hold on!

01:59:46.610 --> 01:59:50.949
<i>Our police have rounded up</i>
<i>all of the Joker's men.</i>

01:59:51.449 --> 01:59:53.619
<i>The reign of crime is over.</i>

01:59:54.119 --> 01:59:57.624
<i>Public safety in Gotham City is</i>
<i>no longer a laughing matter.</i>

01:59:57.874 --> 02:00:00.627
- Aren't you covering the press conference?
- No.

02:00:01.546 --> 02:00:03.548
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

02:00:04.215 --> 02:00:05.634
What about us?

02:00:06.552 --> 02:00:08.721
What about your picture of Batman?

02:00:17.232 --> 02:00:18.316
Take care.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:23.656
<i>We received a letter from Batman.</i>

02:00:25.909 --> 02:00:28.412
<i>"Please inform the citizens of Gotham...</i>

02:00:28.579 --> 02:00:31.416
<i>"...that Gotham City's</i>
<i>earned a rest from crime.</i>

02:00:32.333 --> 02:00:35.671
<i>"But if the forces of evil should rise again...</i>

02:00:36.005 --> 02:00:38.925
<i>"...to cast a shadow on</i>
<i>the heart of the city...</i>

02:00:39.342 --> 02:00:40.677
<i>"...call me."</i>

02:00:41.012 --> 02:00:43.681
Question. How do we call him?

02:00:48.855 --> 02:00:50.690
He gave us a signal.

02:01:26.318 --> 02:01:29.322
I thought champagne would be in order,
ma'am.

02:01:29.656 --> 02:01:30.990
Hi, Alfred.

02:01:40.001 --> 02:01:41.838
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...

02:01:41.921 --> 02:01:44.090
...that he might be a little late.

02:01:46.844 --> 02:01:49.097
I'm not a bit surprised.
