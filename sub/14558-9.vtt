WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:10.578
*

00:10.611 --> 00:13.447
* My, my

00:13.481 --> 00:16.250
* Just look what you've done

00:16.284 --> 00:18.186
* My God

00:20.454 --> 00:22.423
* Something that
you can't defend *

00:22.456 --> 00:25.726
* I'll never be
the same again *

00:25.759 --> 00:29.063
(kids laughing)

00:30.498 --> 00:35.436
* And I don't know why

00:35.469 --> 00:38.339
* I don't know why

00:38.372 --> 00:39.173
(whistling)

00:39.207 --> 00:41.575
You've got to finish
this weekend.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.177
Don't worry.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.346
The kids will have a new
playground by Monday morning.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.818
All right, kids.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.520
He'll be here all day

00:52.553 --> 00:54.388
with that backhoe.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.690
Now you can watch for
a while, but stay back.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.859
That's not a backhoe,
that's a skid loader.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.195
(drilling)

01:01.229 --> 01:02.563
A backhoe's bigger.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.832
- Thank you, Malik.
- Welcome!

01:04.865 --> 01:07.368
Trudy! Make sure they stay
behind the fence.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.237
I got 'em, Mrs. Bell.
All right, come on, guys.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.638
You can watch them over here.

01:14.842 --> 01:18.146
(drilling continues)

01:21.149 --> 01:23.251
- Well, change is good.
CHARLIE: Not always.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.186
Let me rephrase.
Change is inevitable

01:25.219 --> 01:26.420
and those who
adapt most quickly

01:26.454 --> 01:28.556
are most likely to survive.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.590
Yeah, well,
you already have tenure.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.892
It's not an issue for you
like it is for some.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.394
LARRY: Has our new division
chair, Mildred,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.329
said anything to you?

01:35.363 --> 01:37.531
We can protect you.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.566
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.868
esteemed colleagues
and friends.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.470
We celebrate the appointment

01:42.503 --> 01:43.537
of Dr. Mildred Finch

01:43.571 --> 01:47.408
to the Physics-Math-Astronomy
Division Chair...

01:47.441 --> 01:48.676
I just want you to know
I'm willing

01:48.709 --> 01:50.544
to go to bat
for you with Dr. Finch.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.412
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.315
...means that she speaks
your languages.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.449
All of them.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.650
I give you...

01:56.684 --> 01:57.785
Dr. Mildred Finch.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.320
(applause)

02:00.454 --> 02:01.355
Thank you. Thank you.

02:01.389 --> 02:04.558
I am delighted to be
back home with you all.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.693
If she has any sense,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.528
she'll make you
tenure-track.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.862
Well, she already has.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.664
Already?

02:10.698 --> 02:11.665
Tenure?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.334
With a higher salary.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.569
...and we will attract young,
brilliant minds.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.571
We're going to reinvigorate this
division, hmm?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.407
(applause)

02:20.441 --> 02:21.742
Now, one of the

02:21.775 --> 02:23.277
advantages
of having worked here

02:23.311 --> 02:25.246
for so long, is that

02:25.279 --> 02:28.382
I know where all the bodies
are buried, so careful...

02:28.416 --> 02:29.617
(laughter, scattered applause)

02:29.650 --> 02:31.552
That was rather pugnacious.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.422
Oh... change is good.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.560
Where did Dr. Fleinhardt get to?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.262
Oh, he recalled an obligation.
Oh!

02:41.295 --> 02:42.330
Congratulations.
Honestly.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.566
Do you know how wonderful
it is to have a Chair

02:45.599 --> 02:46.767
conversant
in math, physics

02:46.800 --> 02:48.502
and cosmology? I mean...
Well, I intend

02:48.536 --> 02:49.670
to encourage a more
collaborative

02:49.703 --> 02:50.938
spirit among the departments.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.573
You know what,
I like that. I do.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.607
MILDRED: Yeah, and
collaboration takes time,

02:53.641 --> 02:55.243
Charlie, your time.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.411
Of course.
Dr. Ramanujan,

02:57.445 --> 02:58.646
have you considered
my offer?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.415
I have, and...
I would love to work with you

03:01.449 --> 03:02.750
on your research.
Excellent.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.685
And you will serve
on the Curriculum Committee.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.619
Okay.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.620
(stammers)

03:06.654 --> 03:08.356
- Well... hello.
- Oh, hey.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.457
- Hey.
- Sorry.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.391
This is Dr. Mildred Finch.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.992
She's our new Chair.
This is my father, Alan.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.295
Millie. Hi. Millie.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.496
- Nice to meet you, Alan.
- You, too.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.930
AMITA:
Dr. Finch just

03:16.964 --> 03:19.300
returned from an 18-month
sabbatical in Antarctica.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.469
- Really, Antarctica?
- Yeah.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.537
Oh, what were you studying,
penguins or ice?

03:25.639 --> 03:28.309
Actually I insinuated
myself into a minor

03:28.342 --> 03:30.511
position on AMANDA, the
giant neutrino telescope.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.612
Ah!
Yeah,

03:31.645 --> 03:34.415
an engineering job I was
completely ill-suited for.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.683
My father's
an engineer.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.585
I adjusted a dial
three times a week.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.688
I mainly just went
to think in peace.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.358
Oh. So how did
that work out for you?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.327
I came back with a strong sense

03:46.360 --> 03:47.795
of what's important
and what's not.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.563
Which is... what?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.399
Not wasting time.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.005
(thuds, drills)

03:58.038 --> 04:00.574
Okay, a few more minutes,
and then snack time.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.576
We want to stay outside.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.513
Malik, don't you want
some cookies?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.616
(thuds)

04:20.628 --> 04:22.530
(cracking)

04:33.774 --> 04:35.709
(cracking)

04:39.647 --> 04:42.049
(loud rumbling)

04:42.082 --> 04:43.451
(children screaming)

04:46.620 --> 04:47.721
(children wailing)

04:47.755 --> 04:48.789
Hey!

04:48.822 --> 04:50.991
Help...

04:58.065 --> 04:59.333
Help me!

05:00.067 --> 05:01.635
Okay.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.404
(coughing)

05:05.773 --> 05:06.440
Get it.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.545
(screams, thuds)
Trudy!

05:11.579 --> 05:14.848
(children shouting)

05:14.882 --> 05:17.518
(coughing)

05:17.551 --> 05:20.588
GIRL:
Mrs. Perez? Mrs. Perez?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.997
(indistinct radio transmission)

05:33.434 --> 05:34.668
(siren blaring)

05:34.702 --> 05:36.404
REPORTER: Three children have
been pulled from the sinkhole.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.505
Two remain trapped.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.673
The rescued kids and
their caretaker, Trudy Perez,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.642
are en route to County Hospital.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.578
We're awaiting word on their
condition. We'll continue...

05:44.612 --> 05:46.046
Why are we
called in on this?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.382
Apparently the DOJ
has been investigating

05:48.416 --> 05:50.551
Kentwell Construction
for two years--

05:50.584 --> 05:52.720
bribery, wire fraud, kickbacks,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.021
payoffs to cover
half-assed work.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.424
DON: Hey.
The company has offices

05:56.457 --> 05:57.991
all across the Western
states. Big bucks.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.026
You guys
all remember

05:59.059 --> 06:00.628
AUSA Howard Meeks, right?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.095
- Hey.
- Kentwell Construction

06:02.129 --> 06:03.731
built this school?
- The playground.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.699
Ten years ago. My fraud
case has languished.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.035
Hard to prove, hard to get
anybody excited about it.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.570
Unfortunately, now...

06:09.603 --> 06:11.405
- We have victims?
- And publicity.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.407
We want the FBI
to take over

06:13.441 --> 06:14.642
the field investigation.
I've talked to

06:14.675 --> 06:15.676
the local DA
about holding off

06:15.709 --> 06:17.645
on any potential homicide
charges till we take

06:17.678 --> 06:18.646
a shot at these guys.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.147
Did one of
the kids die?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.081
The older lady,

06:21.114 --> 06:23.451
Trudy Perez, is not
expected to make it.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.085
- So what's the plan?
- DON: Well, as soon

06:25.118 --> 06:26.587
as the kids are out,
we're gonna go in.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.888
Let's start with seeing
if we can find

06:27.921 --> 06:28.856
any negligence
on Kentwell's part.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.691
- There is.
- DON: And what about that guy

06:30.724 --> 06:32.092
tearing up the place
with a back hoe?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.694
Local parent
doing a good deed.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.696
It's not his fault.
This has Kentwell's fingerprints

06:35.729 --> 06:37.765
all over it. You really don't
like these guys.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.767
Yeah, money keeps
them above the law,

06:39.800 --> 06:40.734
and it pisses me off.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.671
I want them in prison,
not just paying a fine.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.073
I'll start working on finding
a construction specialist.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.175
Actually, my father might be
able to help you with that.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.710
We should see
if we can find out how

06:49.743 --> 06:51.078
these guys got
the contract to begin with.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.581
Yeah, they had to deal
with someone at the school.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.918
It was a favor, man.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.088
You volunteered to repave
the playground off the books.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.723
The pavement
was cracked.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.591
Kids can't play
ball on that.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.092
You were digging up
the old surface.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.760
- And bam.
- I've gotta call the parents.

07:06.794 --> 07:11.732
Riva! What in the hell
were you thinking?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.735
You can't order work
without school board approval.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.037
I have begged
for help for years.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.641
I am holding you personally
responsible for this travesty.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.744
School Superintendent
Daria Samson.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.881
The old lady died.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.584
Trudy?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.055
(indistinct radio transmission)

07:35.088 --> 07:36.757
(siren wailing)

07:40.761 --> 07:42.730
(mechanical whirring)

07:44.297 --> 07:45.599
This isn't asphalt.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.900
It's too brittle.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.569
It's shattered
like a windshield.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.137
I have no idea
what this is.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.573
Hey! Did they get
the children out?

07:52.606 --> 07:53.941
MEGAN:
Um, the last two boys were

07:53.974 --> 07:56.209
inside the structure
when it went down,

07:56.243 --> 07:57.611
so they're buried,

07:57.645 --> 07:59.079
and the structure's
really unstable, so

07:59.112 --> 08:01.782
it's moving kind of slowly.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.651
ALAN: Were they able to
talk to the kids?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.719
One, but he's getting weak.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.822
Alan, we need to know if this
sinkhole could occur naturally,

08:08.856 --> 08:09.757
or if it's from
faulty construction.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.292
Well, sinkholes are
rare in California.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.894
It's the wrong geology.

08:13.927 --> 08:14.862
Really?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.697
ALAN: The chances are
that this was triggered

08:16.730 --> 08:19.299
by altering the
underground water flow.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.536
Listen, I can model
groundwater flow

08:22.570 --> 08:25.839
using soil samples,
and geological maps.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.708
Okay, tell me what you need.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.678
Well, first off,
construction blueprints.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.079
We got one!

08:33.146 --> 08:34.782
MAN:
They're bringing one up!

08:34.815 --> 08:36.684
All right, go ahead!
Pull him up slow.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.285
Hey, are those
the parents?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.687
MEGAN:
Uh...

08:39.720 --> 08:41.655
would you
excuse me for a second?

08:43.123 --> 08:44.958
You got 'em?
Uh...

08:44.992 --> 08:45.859
one.

08:49.830 --> 08:50.731
Oh!

08:52.165 --> 08:53.734
So far.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.803
PARENT: That's good for them.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.770
Oh!
Thank you.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.672
What's your son's name?

08:58.706 --> 08:59.840
Malik.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.745
Malik.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.839
MEEKS:
Damage control has arrived.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.106
What? Kentwell?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.908
Their attorney, Reed Parkman.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.043
Been legally
obstructing my case

09:36.076 --> 09:37.310
from every direction
for two years.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.378
Very inventive guy.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.780
How you doing there,
Mr... Parkman?

09:39.813 --> 09:40.681
How are you?

09:40.714 --> 09:43.116
So I'm gonna need
a copy of blueprints

09:43.150 --> 09:44.384
from that playground.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.719
All right? I
need, uh...

09:45.753 --> 09:47.888
geology reports...
environmental...

09:47.921 --> 09:48.856
the whole works.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.023
I've got a subpoena.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.625
No problem.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.827
If Kentwell has any culpability,
they'll make it right.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.028
Like they've
done in the past,

09:55.062 --> 09:56.697
good citizens that they are.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.000
Did they rescue
the last boy yet?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.702
Actually, they think
he's unconscious,

10:01.735 --> 10:04.838
so they haven't been
able to find him.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.073
Are those parents
from the school?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.307
I'd like to talk to them.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.408
No contact with
the families.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.943
You're not gonna
buy them off.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.078
Wouldn't dream of it.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.346
My clients want to express
their concern and support.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.782
What, no one from Kentwell's
coming down here?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.750
They've instructed me
to cooperate fully.

10:16.784 --> 10:17.851
I bet.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.386
I've got very
sympathetic victims

10:19.419 --> 10:20.921
for a jury this time, Reed.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.090
I'm going to want a copy
of that report ASAP.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.192
All right.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.294
Fair enough.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.968
LARRY:
The magical element of water

10:35.002 --> 10:37.404
penetrates the impenetrable
like a sleeping mind

10:37.437 --> 10:39.740
dreams the solution
to a problem.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.809
Can you hand me that map?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.945
You know, water not only
moves around rock,

10:44.978 --> 10:47.447
it actually flows
right through it.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.982
Nature has so much to teach us.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.050
You know,
it's possible

10:50.083 --> 10:52.452
that the construction company

10:52.485 --> 10:55.823
caused a slow drainage
of the aquifer,

10:55.856 --> 10:58.225
that then created
an underground cavern

10:58.258 --> 11:01.929
which became the sinkhole.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.898
Or water eroded limestone
over a thousand years

11:04.932 --> 11:06.900
and this was the day, the hour,

11:06.934 --> 11:09.436
the very minute of catastrophic
failure fated for eons.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.871
I like that.

11:10.904 --> 11:11.972
MILDRED: Larry, I've been
looking for you.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.908
Oh, yeah? Actually,
I was just on my way out to...

11:14.942 --> 11:15.876
- To...?
- To, um...

11:15.909 --> 11:17.377
just office hours.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.378
On Saturday?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.013
You know,
we have been trying

11:20.047 --> 11:21.114
to send you an invitation

11:21.148 --> 11:24.818
for my reception and we were
flummoxed to discover

11:24.852 --> 11:26.353
we have no home address for you.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.855
I think just e-mail is-is best.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.957
Yeah, all right,
you know what, Larry?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.725
Where you live,
that's up to you.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.460
That is your business
and I respect your privacy.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.996
Good, because privacy
is important to me.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
Unless...

11:38.065 --> 11:40.433
you're living
in the steam tunnels.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.337
You know, we used
the steam tunnels

11:44.371 --> 11:46.907
to play Dungeons and Dragons
when I was an undergrad,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.209
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. But it seems that

11:49.242 --> 11:50.844
someone has set up house
down there.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.245
Which is no good.

11:52.279 --> 11:56.349
It's a liability.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.886
So I'm going to seal
the steam tunnels, Larry.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.788
- I see.
- Good.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.356
Okay, have a very good weekend.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.157
You, too, sir.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.963
He's living in
the steam tunnels?

12:09.997 --> 12:11.331
I didn't say that.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.167
But maybe you should check
and make sure he's okay.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.502
Yeah, of course.

12:15.535 --> 12:19.106
He was kind of staying with us,

12:19.139 --> 12:21.041
but I think he felt
like he was a burden.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.876
Groundwater flow?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.477
Not high-end math.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.113
- A case for my brother.
- You know what?

12:26.146 --> 12:29.082
We're going to have to tighten
up in that area, as well.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.285
Tighten up?

12:32.319 --> 12:33.286
Yes.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.788
Teamwork, Charles.
All right?

12:34.822 --> 12:35.923
I need you to take more
responsibility

12:35.956 --> 12:38.792
here in this department,
and spend less of your time

12:38.826 --> 12:41.328
on your forensics
pursuits, clear?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.329
Mildred...

12:42.362 --> 12:45.866
You will chair the PhD
Admissions Committee.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.000
Congratulations.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.136
I don't have time for that.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.371
No, not a request, my friend.

12:54.174 --> 12:58.211
(indistinct radio transmission)

12:58.245 --> 13:00.513
MAN:
That close enough?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.415
Mr. Shabaz, it
won't be long.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.451
They think they can get
him out pretty soon.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.718
Okay.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.488
Um, is there anyone else that
you'd like me to call for you?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.390
Maybe someone that can
meet you at the hospital?

13:10.423 --> 13:13.160
My wife's flying in from
a business trip to Chicago.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.328
You have the whole city pulling
for Malik right now.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.864
Well, if we make it
through this,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.098
I'm getting him out of here.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.466
Out of Los Angeles?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.001
Out of the neighborhood.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.270
You guys show up
for a big disaster,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.338
but tomorrow we're
on our own again.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.307
We got classrooms
with no books,

13:27.340 --> 13:28.842
teachers have to provide

13:28.876 --> 13:30.377
toilet paper and pencils.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.145
Kids get sick with
mental illness,

13:32.179 --> 13:33.613
birth defects, cancer.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.282
Malik has a growth on his spine.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.285
Now the doctor's telling me
not to worry,

13:38.318 --> 13:41.288
but children shouldn't have
tumors on their spines

13:41.321 --> 13:43.623
or get trapped
in 20-foot hellholes.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.225
MAN: Coming up. We got him.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.193
Get him out!

13:51.899 --> 13:54.367
What is going on in this place?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.969
MAN:
They got Malik.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.476
CHARLIE: Listen, Kentwell
Construction

14:03.510 --> 14:05.112
is trying to snow you guys
with these meaningless

14:05.145 --> 14:08.115
blueprints and reports.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.117
All right, so there's got to be
a smoking gun in here somewhere.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.218
Look, we got some new files.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.153
Something one of the dads said
is really bugging me

14:13.186 --> 14:14.154
about a lot of sick kids.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.422
How are those little boys doing?

14:15.455 --> 14:16.656
MEGAN:
Serious condition,

14:16.689 --> 14:19.192
but the prognosis is good
for both of them.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.529
You know, I cannot figure out
this paving material.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.696
I read something about that.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.899
Okay, I have two cases of
leukemia at the school now,

14:25.933 --> 14:28.335
and three cases in children
who attended in the past.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.971
Charlie, what are the odds
of this many cancers

14:31.004 --> 14:32.239
in a small school?

14:32.272 --> 14:33.140
Meg, do me a favor.
Just...

14:33.173 --> 14:35.042
I need you on these
new boxes please.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.177
You guys are going to make
me get up, aren't you?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.179
MEGAN: This is a lot of
leukemia.

14:39.212 --> 14:43.050
You're talking about cancer
clusters-- statistically rare.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.217
More likely, this is a case

14:44.251 --> 14:45.618
of Texas sharp shooting.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.254
All right.
Say there's a guy who's

14:47.287 --> 14:48.255
never held a gun before

14:48.288 --> 14:50.390
and he aims at the side
of a barn and he shoots.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.159
And when he's done,
he draws a circle

14:52.192 --> 14:54.161
around the closest shots,

14:54.194 --> 14:55.695
ignores the others
and he declares himself...

14:55.728 --> 14:57.664
A Texas sharpshooter.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.432
Right. And cancer clusters
are just like that.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.968
People over-interpret
the evidence.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.235
DON: Yeah, here we go.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.071
The stuff they
paved with is

15:04.104 --> 15:05.172
called "composite."
It's patented.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.007
- Patented?
- May I?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.176
It's actually made
from recycled materials.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.143
Huh.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.112
Here.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.047
CHARLIE:
TCE's, heavy metals,

15:14.081 --> 15:15.348
Perchlorates.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.383
LARRY:
Oh, my heavens.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.384
What?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.451
That is toxic waste.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.452
No.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.453
Is that legal?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.022
Put it down.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.324
CHARLIE: Well, the
patented process

15:24.357 --> 15:25.492
supposedly makes it inert.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.360
But it's new, so...
DON: Hold on.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.229
You're saying this
stuff is actually breaking down?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.230
LARRY:
Eroding substrate,

15:30.263 --> 15:31.198
creating a sinkhole.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.399
MEGAN:
Causing cancer.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.467
So much for
the Texas sharpshooter.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.309
DAVID: You signed every contract
between Kentwell Construction

15:42.342 --> 15:43.643
and the School Board.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.079
I sign a lot of contracts.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.480
Ms. Samson, were you
aware the stuff

15:47.514 --> 15:49.149
they use for the pavement
is based from toxic waste?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.550
MEEKS:
Toxic waste?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.652
We had EPA clearance,
it's harmless.

15:52.685 --> 15:53.586
You knew about it?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.288
It's irrelevant.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.124
DAVID:
Is it also irrelevant that you

15:57.157 --> 15:58.725
lease a vacation home
from Kentwell

15:58.758 --> 16:00.260
on Catalina Island

16:00.293 --> 16:03.030
for a few hundred
dollars a year?

16:04.731 --> 16:07.100
I came in here to help.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.735
If you're accusing
me of something,

16:08.768 --> 16:10.437
speak to my attorney.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.738
Wait, wait, hold on.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.340
How long have you had an
attorney?

16:13.373 --> 16:17.210
Is it Reed Parkman? Same
as Kentwell Construction?

16:17.244 --> 16:18.745
DAVID:
When we connect you to this,

16:18.778 --> 16:21.681
you'll be on the hook
for Trudy Perez's death

16:21.714 --> 16:23.416
and the injury
to those children.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.325
(indistinct voices)

16:32.359 --> 16:34.061
MEGAN:
How is Malik doing?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.029
His surgery went well.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.597
He won't be awake
for another few hours.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.500
My wife is with him.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.370
Um, all these parents
have sick kids?

16:43.403 --> 16:45.372
This school has lots of
neurological disorders

16:45.405 --> 16:46.339
as well as cancers.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.541
Learning disabilities,
behavioral problems.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.143
It's all documented.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.313
This related to the
playground caving in?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.148
All the kids who fell in have
rashes. What's going on?

16:55.182 --> 16:56.149
We don't know,

16:56.183 --> 16:57.384
but that's why I asked you

16:57.417 --> 16:58.285
to bring all these folks here.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.355
Hey, everyone.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.324
Thank you for coming.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.459
CHARLIE:
You seen Larry?

17:06.493 --> 17:09.028
No, not this weekend.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.166
Hey.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.302
Do you want to have dinner
with me tonight?

17:15.335 --> 17:16.669
MILDRED:
Excuse me...

17:16.703 --> 17:17.570
Dr. Ramanujan.

17:17.604 --> 17:21.474
Are you Dr. Eppes'
personal assistant?

17:21.508 --> 17:22.775
At his beck and call

17:22.809 --> 17:24.477
24/seven, as they say?

17:24.511 --> 17:25.345
What?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.413
Nice.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.414
That's not fair.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.149
I see that you've been on
the supercomputer

17:29.182 --> 17:30.550
for... well, a while now,

17:30.583 --> 17:33.186
so I have to
de-prioritize your job.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.355
Is this an FBI case?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.457
We're working with odds ratios.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.326
You know what?
It's all right, Amita.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.328
Yes, it is an FBI case.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.430
We're analyzing childhood
cancers, birth defects

17:43.463 --> 17:45.132
and neurological deficits

17:45.165 --> 17:46.499
related to a potentially
toxic material.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.467
- So...
MILDRED: I see.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.836
Well, it is now low priority
on the server.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.171
Dr. Finch,
the supercomputer

17:51.204 --> 17:53.340
is the only way to analyze

17:53.373 --> 17:56.543
large data sets quickly
for proper comparison.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.645
I have sympathy for the
families, Charlie, I do.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.314
I nursed my father through
cancer, I don't take it lightly.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.350
But I'm also aware
that the person

18:03.383 --> 18:05.185
who could discover
the cure for cancer

18:05.218 --> 18:06.386
may be one of our students

18:06.419 --> 18:08.588
who would benefit greatly
from the use of this computer,

18:08.621 --> 18:10.690
not to mention
the attentions

18:10.723 --> 18:13.460
of Professors Eppes
and Ramanujan.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.494
CHARLIE:
Not one student

18:14.527 --> 18:17.330
has suffered from our work
at the FBI. Not one.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.565
To the contrary...

18:18.598 --> 18:20.333
There are many ways
to contribute

18:20.367 --> 18:21.568
to improving the world, Charlie.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.336
CHARLIE:
Excuse me.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.671
We'll take this up
again, Mildred.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.373
Millie.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.578
I don't appreciate being
disrespected,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.247
especially in front
of a colleague.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.516
Then you might want to behave
more like a colleague.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.684
I beg your pardon?

18:37.717 --> 18:40.520
Well, you're dating your
thesis professor.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.222
You dress like a kid.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.591
Sorry, I didn't realize
there was a dress code.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.560
Amita, you have the most
promising career

18:47.594 --> 18:49.562
of any of
the faculty hires.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.898
I just want you to have
the major career

18:51.931 --> 18:53.266
that you are capable of.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.436
I appreciate that.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.405
So, you have to redefine
yourself as a professor,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.373
not a grad student.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.474
An individual,

19:01.508 --> 19:03.643
not some appendage
of Charlie Eppes.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.479
Okay, well, thanks
for clearing that up.

19:06.513 --> 19:10.450
Which means taking your own
research more seriously

19:10.483 --> 19:13.220
than you take his.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.188
MEGAN:
Uh, what year did

19:15.222 --> 19:16.723
your granddaughter
start at Matheson?

19:16.756 --> 19:21.528
Katie was in kindergarten
during construction, 1994.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.829
She was always on the swings,

19:22.862 --> 19:24.797
loved tumbling,

19:24.831 --> 19:27.434
said she was going
to the Olympics.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.502
My wife noticed the tumor
at a gymnastics tournament.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.870
Neuroblastoma.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.972
MEGAN: And what year
was she diagnosed?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.207
'99.

19:34.241 --> 19:37.510
I'm not sure if it was the chemo
that killed her or the cancer.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.380
Miss Reeves,
who did this?

19:40.413 --> 19:44.384
What's going on here?

19:44.417 --> 19:48.655
I don't know, Mr. Bowden, but
I'm going to try and find out.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.699
All right, what
do you got?

19:59.732 --> 20:03.303
Matheson Elementary has a
substantial elevation of

20:03.336 --> 20:04.871
cancer and neurological
deficit rates

20:04.904 --> 20:06.406
compared to the national
average.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.640
Right. And?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.409
The normal background rate

20:09.442 --> 20:11.578
is, like, one incident,
of let's say leukemia,

20:11.611 --> 20:13.313
in every 10,000 kids.

20:13.346 --> 20:16.483
Matheson has seven times
that frequency.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.550
Sounds like a cluster,

20:17.584 --> 20:19.018
Yeah.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.422
This is a statistical map

20:22.455 --> 20:25.392
of pediatric toxicology
in L.A. County.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.395
Each dot represents
one sick child.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.862
Blue is for AML--

20:29.896 --> 20:31.698
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.467
Red are for
neurological disorders.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.437
Green are birth defects.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.572
To me this is a much bigger
problem than Kentwell, right?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.741
It would seem that way,
but take a look at this.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.411
These are schools
in L.A. County

20:44.444 --> 20:46.713
with playgrounds paved
by Kentwell.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.481
No way.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.318
Don, we don't have one,

20:51.351 --> 20:52.785
we have 17

20:52.819 --> 20:54.521
cancer clusters.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.524
(sighs)

21:00.927 --> 21:03.496
MEGAN: So has Charlie been able
to find a link

21:03.530 --> 21:05.432
between the paving materials
and the cancer?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.066
It's circumstantial.
The stuff seems harmless.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.570
Yeah, but everywhere it shows
up, there's a cancer cluster.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.572
You don't think Kentwell's
manufacturing it, do you?

21:12.605 --> 21:13.806
No, their parent company,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.975
Desert Shale-- who's paid
to receive

21:16.008 --> 21:17.644
toxic waste from 48 states.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.479
DON: They don't do
what they're supposed to.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.947
They don't dispose of it.
- Which is expensive,

21:20.980 --> 21:22.682
so Desert Shale
melts it into aggregate.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.517
And then sells it
to their own company,

21:24.551 --> 21:25.785
who sells it to schools.

21:25.818 --> 21:26.986
Jackasses.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.421
They're making money
coming and going.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.656
It's a brilliant
scheme.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.657
I knew about
the fraud,

21:30.690 --> 21:32.692
but not the potential
environmental crimes.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.561
And you said this is
all over the West?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.429
Well, if that's true, Howard,
this case just got huge.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.530
Oh, yeah. These
people will not

21:37.564 --> 21:38.831
want to go in front of a jury.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.832
They'll want to deal, but...

21:39.866 --> 21:41.000
Right, you want
to lock them up.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.370
- So do I.
- We have to do this right, Don.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.505
All right, well, let's
be smart about it.

21:48.841 --> 21:49.809
Ooh!

21:49.842 --> 21:50.710
I thought you
were Mildred.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.612
- Where have you been?
- I have a life.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.414
- That's where I've been.
- A life I'm clearly unaware of.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.048
- Where have you been staying?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.417
Oh no, seriously...

21:57.450 --> 21:58.518
Seriously, I thought
you've been staying

21:58.551 --> 21:59.786
with Megan
these last few weeks.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.821
We have decidedly not
gotten that structured

22:01.854 --> 22:03.523
in the expansion
of our complexity.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.557
Do you need something?

22:04.591 --> 22:05.992
I've got a class
in five minutes.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.627
Are you sleeping
in the steam tunnels?

22:07.660 --> 22:08.628
Only as a fallback.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.762
A fallback to what?

22:09.796 --> 22:11.864
Larry, why don't you just
come stay over our place?

22:11.898 --> 22:12.865
You know you're welcome.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.367
I thank you, sincerely.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.968
You and your father,
your generosity,

22:16.002 --> 22:17.870
it's gone beyond what
any friend could expect.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.106
Yes, I'm so generous.
Look, just come over.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.374
Come over.
Stay with us.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.510
I can't afford
the distraction.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.478
The distraction of what?
Distraction of a place to live?

22:25.512 --> 22:27.380
Of sharing a bathtub.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.381
Bathtub?

22:28.415 --> 22:29.315
Yes.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.584
See, if I'm so much
as around a bathtub,

22:31.618 --> 22:33.420
I can't seem to
stay out of it.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.754
Which is no problem
if I'm alone.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.656
But you have one bathtub;
it just doesn't work.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.958
So you've been sleeping
in the steam tunnels.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.628
Well, one copes as one does.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.829
Have to accept
our funny little ways.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.532
Where will you go when Mildred
seals those steam tunnels?

22:45.565 --> 22:47.567
The Arroyo Parkway Suites.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.135
What?

22:49.168 --> 22:50.870
(sighs)

22:50.903 --> 22:52.104
I could use your help later.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.440
All right, you bet.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.544
We've taken every precaution
to protect anyone

22:57.577 --> 22:59.011
who comes in contact
with the aggrega...

22:59.045 --> 23:00.947
We've got 17 cancer clusters
saying your...

23:00.980 --> 23:02.449
That's Kentwell Construction's
liability.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.950
MEEKS:
It's one company.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.553
I'll pierce that
corporate veil so fast...

23:06.586 --> 23:07.554
We prove you knew this
material was toxic

23:07.587 --> 23:09.188
and you used it anyway,
you're going to prison.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.256
The product is inert.

23:10.289 --> 23:13.526
We've established that
through repeated testing.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.428
We have an EPA
Compliance Officer

23:15.462 --> 23:16.763
who knows every inch
of the business.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.130
- Call him.
- DON: Let me guess--

23:18.164 --> 23:19.899
he's got
a vacation house in Catalina?

23:19.932 --> 23:21.934
I'm sending a new EPA Officer.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.803
Desert Shale is
a legitimate business.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.705
No one wants to deal
with this kind

23:25.738 --> 23:27.840
of chemical garbage,
but this company has made

23:27.874 --> 23:29.041
a good faith effort

23:29.075 --> 23:32.545
to recycle industrial
waste, and to do so

23:32.579 --> 23:34.146
within every rule and
regulation on the books.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.715
And yet we have this problem.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.486
What we don't know
about the aggregate

23:39.519 --> 23:40.787
is how it breaks down over time.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.589
Uh...

23:42.622 --> 23:45.625
We'll work with the government
to get to the bottom of this.

23:45.658 --> 23:49.228
If I have to liquidate Kentwell
to pay for it, I will.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.498
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.566
I got kids and grandkids.

23:53.600 --> 23:57.870
I'm not leaving them
a company with this legacy.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.540
We'll straighten out the problem
with the aggregate.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.610
Meanwhile, let's
compensate the families

24:03.643 --> 24:05.545
and repave every site
with asphalt.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.955
So, Mildred wants me to chair
the PhD Admissions Committee.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.725
She didn't ask me to do it,
she just announced it,

24:18.758 --> 24:20.226
and I won't do it.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.128
She's a trifle pushy,
our Mildred.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.029
I really
don't appreciate

24:23.062 --> 24:25.264
her trying to throw you out,
you know?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.398
I mean, I agree.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.601
I don't think you should
sleep in the steam tunnels,

24:28.635 --> 24:30.637
but that is your choice.
That's not her choice.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.904
Have you made
your reservation

24:31.938 --> 24:33.606
at the Arroyo Parkway Suites?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.943
Charles, I have to say...

24:38.711 --> 24:40.580
I don't
think this material is active.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.582
This rock is
12 years old.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.816
It's still
completely inert.

24:43.850 --> 24:47.554
You would have to eat a pound
a day of this to become ill.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.689
Yeah. Well, then, if the
aggregate is not causing kids

24:49.722 --> 24:50.857
to get sick, what is?

24:50.890 --> 24:54.727
The recycling process--
it seems sound.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.697
They heat waste chemicals
to 3,000 degrees,

24:57.730 --> 24:58.898
they cool the slag,

24:58.931 --> 25:00.933
they test it
for toxicity.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.069
If any remains,
they process again.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.271
And how much evaporates?

25:05.304 --> 25:06.639
They capture
the evaporate.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.207
Very little escapes.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.643
Well, then, the amount of waste
that they take in

25:10.677 --> 25:12.645
should roughly match the amount
of aggregate that they put out.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.146
That's correct.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.247
It doesn't.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.584
Here. Check it out.
I've developed

25:17.617 --> 25:19.652
a set of
inequalities that

25:19.686 --> 25:21.688
indicate with high confidence
that Desert Shale

25:21.721 --> 25:23.790
has taken in over

25:23.823 --> 25:27.193
154,000 tons of waste
over the last ten years.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.729
The aggregate
that they produce is...

25:29.762 --> 25:30.563
I mean,
they're missing

25:30.597 --> 25:32.665
nearly 80,000 tons
of toxic waste.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.135
So what caused the sinkhole?

25:36.168 --> 25:38.871
I mean, the acid didn't
just seep into the groundwater

25:38.905 --> 25:40.539
from the aggregate.

25:43.743 --> 25:44.877
Right.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.346
- Right what?
- Desert Shale--

25:47.379 --> 25:51.618
it's missing 80,000 tons
of acidic chemical sludge.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.686
Where is it?

25:53.720 --> 25:54.954
Oh, they wouldn't.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.923
Don?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.093
(indistinct radio transmission)

26:01.127 --> 26:03.129
CHARLIE:
Hey. So we found

26:03.162 --> 26:05.164
benzene residue in the sinkhole.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.332
Now, that is probably

26:06.365 --> 26:09.702
what killed the elderly lady,
and probably what caused

26:09.736 --> 26:10.670
the children's rashes.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.171
DAVID: This is benzene
from the aggregate?

26:12.204 --> 26:14.140
No. From acidic sludge
in the groundwater.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.708
ALAN: Well, if it wasn't from
the aggregate,

26:15.742 --> 26:17.143
where the hell did
the acid come from?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.745
Well, we think

26:18.778 --> 26:20.980
that Desert Shale buried
toxic waste in the ground,

26:21.013 --> 26:23.315
and then it seeped
into the water table, Dad.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.718
They're dumping toxic waste
at elementary schools?

26:25.752 --> 26:27.854
LARRY: Okay, Charlie,
time to clear the area.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.255
Okay. Fire in the hole!

26:29.288 --> 26:32.158
MAN: Copy that. Fire in the
hole.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.628
- All personnel out of...
- Three, two, one!

26:35.662 --> 26:36.896
MAN:
All clear.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.665
Seismic imaging, huh?

26:38.698 --> 26:39.866
Yeah. Locating the source
of the acid.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.901
What are you saying
happened here, man?

26:41.934 --> 26:45.037
Well, the acid effect
was like Swiss cheese.

26:45.071 --> 26:49.175
Bacteria devour lactic acid,
giving off carbon dioxide,

26:49.208 --> 26:52.745
which cannot escape, producing
bubbles in the cheese.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.815
Now, here, acid in groundwater
ate into the rock,

26:55.848 --> 26:57.684
creating pockets of gas
which became

26:57.717 --> 26:59.418
the sinkhole when
the surface was breached.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.253
So what about the explosion?

27:01.287 --> 27:02.755
ALAN:
Seismic imaging.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.023
It's the same as
in oil fields.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.025
Gives them a picture
of what's underground.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.326
That's right. We send
controlled vibrations

27:07.359 --> 27:08.761
to the ground to receivers.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.162
It's sonar, like a bat?

27:10.196 --> 27:11.798
Like thousands of
bats all sending

27:11.831 --> 27:13.365
their information
back to the computers.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.736
We get a precise map of the
geology, plus it pinpoints

27:16.769 --> 27:19.338
anomalies just
like these.

27:19.371 --> 27:24.076
Okay. J-28/AE-87.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.212
- Initiating over here.
- Right there.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.714
Okay. Yeah. Three feet down.

27:27.747 --> 27:28.915
If you and Charlie are right...

27:28.948 --> 27:30.917
David, we're not
just guessing here.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.819
We've got three dozen
barrels down there.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.053
MAN:
Yeah, we got something here.

27:34.086 --> 27:37.223
Yeah, I got a couple barrels.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.058
I can't believe this.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.092
Dad, why don't you
get away from there?

27:40.126 --> 27:41.694
I see iron ore.

27:41.728 --> 27:42.528
Rust.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.797
MAN: Yeah, there's stuff
that's nasty.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.365
It's definitely hot.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.734
Dad, come on.
Come on.

27:47.767 --> 27:48.868
Those cold-blooded bastards.

27:48.901 --> 27:52.438
Those are barrels of poison
they buried down there.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.847
The I.D. numbers were
sanded off the barrels.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.849
I can't prove they
came from Desert Shale.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.751
We're testing for a match
with the aggregate.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.052
Resnick knew
about the barrels,

28:06.085 --> 28:08.020
which is why he offered
to repave every site.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.857
Yeah, so it makes it look
like he's doing the right thing.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.725
MEGAN: 57 kids in your school
district have leukemia.

28:12.759 --> 28:16.896
How in God's name do you
rationalize something like that?

28:16.929 --> 28:19.732
They told me it was harmless,
and I believed them.

28:19.766 --> 28:20.666
- I didn't know.
- DAVID: You knew.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.803
I didn't know
what was in the barrels--

28:23.836 --> 28:25.905
what it would do.
Please, I would never...

28:25.938 --> 28:28.340
Do you know that grandmother
was an asthmatic?

28:28.374 --> 28:31.010
She died from
inhaling benzene.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.745
That's a death
that we can link to you.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.950
I can't go to prison!

28:37.984 --> 28:39.285
You should be forced to inhale

28:39.318 --> 28:40.853
that crap.

28:40.887 --> 28:43.022
(sighs)
Oh, God...

28:46.392 --> 28:48.327
Can we make a deal?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.330
Depends on what
you have to say.

28:51.363 --> 28:55.868
Boyd Resnick paid
for my school board campaign.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.371
He put me in office so that
I would give them contracts.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.277
She's a drunk.
She's not credible.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.345
This is your client.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.346
We're talking about your client.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.347
And, as for
the barrels,

29:08.380 --> 29:10.282
by law, the school district

29:10.316 --> 29:12.819
is responsible for any
contamination of its grounds.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.022
Unless it can be tied
specifically to Desert Shale,

29:16.055 --> 29:17.123
you've got nothing.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.792
I thought you were representing
Kentwell Construction.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.193
My firm represents
both companies.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.561
Come on. Who you think
you're talking to here?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.030
It's one company.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.232
You better get
your own lawyer.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.367
We're looking at you
as a co-conspirator.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.139
When will you depose her?

29:33.172 --> 29:35.107
You seem a little
rattled, Counselor.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.409
You better get
your game face on.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.382
They'll try to pay Samson off,
send her to Aruba or someplace.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.451
You think they'd try
to whack her?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.353
These guys don't like
to get their hands dirty.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.421
They'll do it with money
if they can, but she's the link

29:49.455 --> 29:51.323
between Resnick
and the barrels.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.326
All right. So I better get her
into protective custody, huh?

30:01.167 --> 30:02.969
Kac-Moody Algebras.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.370
It's nice to see you
in teacher mode.

30:04.403 --> 30:05.404
Mildred.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.007
We need to talk.
Millie.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.142
And same here, mister.
I did not like the way

30:10.176 --> 30:12.011
that you walked out on our last
encounter. Rude.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.380
It was urgent, or else
I wouldn't have taken off.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.515
Look, honestly, I don't think
it's right for you to...

30:16.548 --> 30:19.085
Sure. Okay. So
here's the rule:

30:19.118 --> 30:21.420
No canceling class
for FBI consulting.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.022
And, if you use

30:23.055 --> 30:25.224
the super computer,
they have to pay for it.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.625
I've adhered to
those standards all along.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.227
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.096
- Great.
- Wonderful.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.531
We're good, then.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.299
Shouldn't you apologize?

30:33.332 --> 30:34.967
For what?

30:35.001 --> 30:38.304
For harassing me
inappropriately.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.106
That's not
harassment.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.108
Harassment is what
you're in store for

30:42.141 --> 30:45.111
if you give me any more trouble
about your PhD committee.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.113
I don't have time for that.
I told you.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.280
You know what?
You're gonna make

30:48.314 --> 30:49.515
time, and you're
gonna be great.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.351
We need you. We need
a young professor there

30:52.384 --> 30:54.053
to attract the best students,

30:54.086 --> 30:55.521
and understand
their issues.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.556
Come on, face it--
as far as

30:57.589 --> 31:00.059
math professors go,
you are the Sean Connery.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.163
Double-O Seven?

31:04.196 --> 31:09.135
Think about it-- handsome,
suave, you solve crimes. Hmm?

31:09.168 --> 31:11.137
Come on. Pierce Brosnan,
Roger Moore

31:11.170 --> 31:12.905
are little girls
compared to Connery.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.273
With the exception
of Timothy Dalton,

31:14.306 --> 31:16.375
who had a little
something going on,

31:16.408 --> 31:18.945
it's been a downhill slide
since George Lazenby,

31:18.978 --> 31:21.013
so believe me,
you want to be

31:21.047 --> 31:22.448
the Sean Connery
of the math department.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.050
First meeting, my office.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.617
- What?
- Good.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.087
You know, you... You speak of
collaboration.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.122
I must tell you that
this feels more like tyranny.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.690
Yeah. Well, you say potato.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.259
You know what?

31:33.292 --> 31:35.294
We should get some publicity
from your FBI thing.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.695
We'll figure out
a way to leverage it

31:36.728 --> 31:38.364
for fund-raising. Good idea?

31:38.397 --> 31:39.665
Dr. Finch, Mildred...

31:39.698 --> 31:41.067
- Good.
- Mild...

31:41.100 --> 31:42.901
Have a good class.
Millie!

31:44.003 --> 31:45.104
Hi, handsome.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.405
Hey. What are you

31:46.438 --> 31:48.574
doing here? Ah!

31:48.607 --> 31:50.309
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.643
Is it Wednesday already?

31:51.677 --> 31:53.179
Did I miss our lunch?
Forgive me.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.981
It's Monday.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.415
Oh. All right.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.150
Okay, I'll
see you later.

31:58.184 --> 32:02.088
Hey, I just wanted
to have a conversation.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.190
- Oh!
- No lunch, no dinner.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.192
Is this the use
of the wild card?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.727
I think I should get
to use the wild card

32:08.760 --> 32:11.397
for something wild, okay?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.165
Okay.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.167
I was thinking you should
come and stay with me.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.703
Oh, no. Oh, no, no,
no, no! My God, no.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.439
That would just
be untenable.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.374
Charlie told me you
were staying in a hotel.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.575
I have an extra room.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.111
No. That would be
a serious breach

32:25.144 --> 32:26.712
of the protocol that
we've so carefully

32:26.745 --> 32:29.281
and thoughtfully
established, and... What?

32:29.315 --> 32:31.150
Oh, that's just
my... my floss.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.618
No, no. I think
that would

32:32.651 --> 32:34.720
mark the end before
we've even really begun.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.722
I'm not going to be there.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.524
Oh...

32:38.557 --> 32:40.426
I have to go stay with a witness
for a couple of days.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.695
You can use the space
and sort out your life.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.731
It's just a friendly offer
with no strings attached.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.467
Have you a bathtub?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.602
Why?

32:55.474 --> 32:57.476
DON:
So, any luck?

32:57.509 --> 32:58.644
Not yet.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.080
When we get the specific
chemical makeup of each barrel

33:01.113 --> 33:03.749
will we be able to trace it
back to a company of origin?

33:03.782 --> 33:06.452
Is there the chemical equivalent
of a fingerprint?

33:06.485 --> 33:07.453
We're going through garbage.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.754
We'll be lucky to figure out

33:08.787 --> 33:10.256
which industry
each barrel came from.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.723
All right, let us know
what you get.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.359
I mean,
so the whole thing's going

33:13.392 --> 33:14.460
to ride
on Samson's testimony.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.727
Set up her deposition
for tomorrow.

33:20.299 --> 33:21.567
MEGAN:
I'm all set, Don.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.202
We'll have her delivered

33:23.235 --> 33:26.805
to the District Attorney's
office at 9:00 a.m. Thanks.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.607
(sighs)

33:28.640 --> 33:30.576
How long do we have
to keep up this,

33:30.609 --> 33:34.413
this witness protection routine?

33:34.446 --> 33:36.782
Until you're deposed
or relocated,

33:36.815 --> 33:38.417
whichever comes first.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.119
And after I'm deposed,
I'm free?

33:40.152 --> 33:41.720
First, you'll have
to testify.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.489
Sure you want
to drink that right now?

33:43.522 --> 33:45.824
(laughs)

33:45.857 --> 33:48.527
Believe me, Agent,
you do not want

33:48.560 --> 33:50.829
to spend the evening with me
if I'm not drinking.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.765
Davidson to Megan:
approaching your location.

33:53.799 --> 33:54.733
Copy.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.841
Cobb salad for the ladies,
cheeseburger for me.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.111
MEGAN:
You got it from Dominick's?

34:05.144 --> 34:07.446
Watched the old man
cook it myself.

34:08.814 --> 34:11.617
Ugh! This is ridiculous.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.718
I'm going to lie down.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.053
You don't want something
to eat first?

34:20.392 --> 34:21.827
(crash, groaning)

34:21.860 --> 34:24.796
(choking)

34:24.830 --> 34:25.797
Daria?

34:25.831 --> 34:27.399
Daria, breathe!

34:27.433 --> 34:28.834
Davidson, call an ambulance!

34:28.867 --> 34:31.337
This is Agent Davidson.
We have a medical emergency.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.804
- Requesting assistance.
- Breathe, breathe.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.273
(coughing)

34:34.306 --> 34:34.840
Damn it!

34:41.647 --> 34:45.517
MEGAN: I don't believe it.
That's what killed her?

34:45.551 --> 34:48.454
Ventricular tachycardia?

34:48.487 --> 34:49.255
Her heart basically exploded?

34:49.288 --> 34:52.291
The lab said
the food was clean.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.692
We checked with the restaurant.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.661
She never even ate the food--
I have no idea

34:55.694 --> 34:57.296
how this happened.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.531
All of the hotel glasses
were laced with peanut oil.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.867
She's extremely
allergic.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.702
Anaphylactic shock?

35:03.735 --> 35:04.803
Yeah.

35:04.836 --> 35:08.740
She was allergic and Parkman
and Resnick knew this?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.509
I'll bet it's in her medical
records at the School Board.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.645
MEGAN: I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.814
Hey, no. Come on. Look, this
could happen to anybody.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.716
Without Daria Samson's
testimony, we don't have a case.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.318
We have to nail
these animals.

35:20.719 --> 35:24.756
You know, each one of these
kids was attacked

35:24.790 --> 35:28.527
by these men for money.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.831
And each of these families
will never be the same.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.701
Well, we got to get these guys
on tape somehow.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.936
MEEKS: Eavesdropping warrant
could take weeks.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.471
And who knows
how long after that

35:39.505 --> 35:41.573
before we get them
saying something incriminating?

35:41.607 --> 35:43.442
We're just going to have
to help them along.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.518
Who's the EPA sending?

35:52.551 --> 35:54.620
Guy out of the
Chicago office--

35:54.653 --> 35:56.188
Lyle Grant.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.823
What do we know about him?

35:57.856 --> 35:59.558
Enough.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.629
Well, walk him through
same as before.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.830
Just get it done.
(phone rings)

36:04.863 --> 36:06.698
Yeah.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.867
Send him over.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.370
Our new EPA officer is here.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.981
Mr. Grant...

36:23.014 --> 36:24.383
I'm Floyd Resnick.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.784
Shh, hold it. Here we go.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.554
DAVID: I need full access to all
areas of your plant, sir.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.322
Of course. Reed'll
take good care of you.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.423
Anything you need.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.558
What's Resnick doing there?

36:32.591 --> 36:33.559
They're desperate.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.526
Let's take a walk.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.867
Mr. Resnick and I intend to do
whatever we can to cooperate.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.469
Attitude like that
helps a lot.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.003
Which is why we want
to be sure

36:45.036 --> 36:48.674
things are being done
carefully, slowly.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.841
I can't help you there.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.777
Under a lot of pressure
from the DOJ

36:51.810 --> 36:53.245
to speed up the process.

36:53.279 --> 36:55.781
It's just that we'd really like

36:55.814 --> 36:59.618
to be your partner
on this if we can.

36:59.651 --> 37:03.589
EPA records indicate
your company receives about

37:03.622 --> 37:06.658
12,000 barrels of contaminants
a month, correct?

37:06.692 --> 37:08.294
There's a lot
of background noise.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.595
I need a clean
transcript.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.662
Yeah, Billy, you can
clean that up.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.930
PARKMAN:
That's the slag furnace.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.434
They fill it with chemical
waste, heat it

37:15.467 --> 37:17.303
to 3,000 degrees
and out comes

37:17.336 --> 37:18.470
harmless aggregate.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.639
It's really a
recycling miracle.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.608
What is a miracle
is that Desert Shale

37:22.641 --> 37:24.943
only uses 52% of the waste
it takes in

37:24.976 --> 37:26.745
to make its paving material.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.615
Where does the rest
of that toxic waste go to?

37:29.648 --> 37:30.782
They have a warehouse.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.818
I need to have
a look there as well.

37:32.851 --> 37:33.819
I want a chemical team

37:33.852 --> 37:36.588
out here to check
their storage safeguards.

37:36.622 --> 37:39.057
The other EPA officer was
able to accomplish his work

37:39.090 --> 37:40.526
with just a visual inspection.

37:40.559 --> 37:41.827
We're paying
closer attention now.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.329
I think you understand.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.496
Still, it would

37:44.530 --> 37:47.666
be a shame for all of our
reputations to be destroyed

37:47.699 --> 37:50.836
on the basis of an error
in your judgment.

37:50.869 --> 37:54.306
Excuse me.
An error in my judgment?

37:54.340 --> 37:55.941
PARKMAN: If one looks hard
enough,

37:55.974 --> 37:57.709
one is bound to find something,

37:57.743 --> 37:59.611
isn't that right?

37:59.645 --> 38:00.779
Oh, they're totally buying it.

38:00.812 --> 38:01.847
For instance,

38:01.880 --> 38:05.317
you vacation in Vegas
quite a lot.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.386
Don't you, Mr. Grant?

38:07.419 --> 38:09.054
Credit report shows you
in substantial debt

38:09.087 --> 38:11.590
to several casinos as well
as some serious arrears

38:11.623 --> 38:12.958
in your child-support
obligations.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.726
Are you trying
to blackmail me?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.696
No. Just the opposite.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.566
Like I said, we'd like
to be your partner on this.

38:20.599 --> 38:25.604
There's a chance here
for all of us to benefit.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.940
You going to buy me off?

38:28.974 --> 38:30.509
We can arrange a loan

38:30.542 --> 38:34.813
from a legitimate source
with very long terms.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.582
If I fix the records.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.550
We send out trucks of waste
for burial,

38:38.584 --> 38:41.487
you mark them as aggregate,
simple as that.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.358
And all of our problems go away?

38:46.392 --> 38:48.627
You really can't imagine
the kind of future

38:48.660 --> 38:49.695
we can offer you, Mr. Grant.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.731
Just need one more thing.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.569
What about the money?

38:57.603 --> 38:59.938
Mr. Resnick controls a number

38:59.971 --> 39:01.540
of legitimate lending
institutions.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.843
We offer you an
offshore account number.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.012
- He just implicated Resnick.
- Which means we got 'em all.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.680
Let's go. Let's go. Hit it.
We're gonna move in.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.749
All teams move in.
Move in!

39:10.782 --> 39:12.150
All right, let's
go, let's go.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.653
No one will ever know
any money

39:14.686 --> 39:15.921
even changed hands.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.389
FBI, nobody move!

39:17.423 --> 39:18.724
FBI, nobody move!

39:18.757 --> 39:19.691
Turn around, Resnick!

39:19.725 --> 39:20.559
Get your hands behind
your back. Let's go.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.159
- Easy, easy, be cool.
- Whoa-oa-oa!

39:21.192 --> 39:23.161
All right,
all right.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.329
All right, what's going on?

39:24.362 --> 39:25.964
What's going on is you're under
arrest, Parkman. This way.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.138
Parkman, what the hell?

39:33.171 --> 39:35.441
DON: All right, get 'em
out of here.

39:35.474 --> 39:38.977
I think you're gonna need
yourself a new lawyer.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.646
Let's go.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.118
(faint clattering)

39:50.522 --> 39:53.659
So, um... you know,
I've been thinking

39:53.692 --> 39:58.196
and, uh, I'm not sure
if it's such

39:58.229 --> 39:59.998
a great idea
for us to go out.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.535
What?

40:03.569 --> 40:04.503
Why?

40:04.536 --> 40:05.837
What happened?

40:05.871 --> 40:06.672
I don't know.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.707
I don't even know
if I mean that.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.576
I just, uh,

40:10.609 --> 40:13.912
I mean, college protocol
frowns on it... and...

40:13.945 --> 40:16.515
we don't even seem sure
if we want to be together,

40:16.548 --> 40:18.183
and I'm massively confused

40:18.216 --> 40:20.018
and you're
ambivalent.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.621
And you know, I'm about
to get incredibly busy

40:22.654 --> 40:24.222
working with Mildred
on this research.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.691
It's something
I'm interested in.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.626
It would be
a great stretch for me,

40:27.659 --> 40:29.461
not to mention
it's just smart

40:29.495 --> 40:30.962
to have her as my mentor.

40:30.996 --> 40:35.634
And I know that I
shouldn't even consider...

40:35.667 --> 40:39.037
I just never know what's
personal and what's professional

40:39.070 --> 40:40.706
with us.
I know. It's...

40:40.739 --> 40:41.873
been...

40:49.748 --> 40:50.716
That was nice.

40:50.749 --> 40:51.883
I concur.

40:51.917 --> 40:52.918
Hello?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.486
Uh...

40:54.520 --> 40:55.153
Oh!

40:55.186 --> 40:56.488
Dr. Finch, what are you...

40:56.522 --> 40:57.689
what are you doing here?

40:57.723 --> 40:59.591
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.992
Are you checking up on us?

41:01.026 --> 41:02.528
Absolutely not.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.529
I'm looking for Alan.

41:03.562 --> 41:06.231
My father?

41:06.264 --> 41:08.867
Pretend I wasn't here.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.602
Okay, I'm gone.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.504
What is up
with that woman?

41:12.538 --> 41:13.639
I don't know about you,

41:13.672 --> 41:16.775
but I-I can't just pretend
that she wasn't just here.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.144
She was here.
I-I saw the woman.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.181
Shall we?

41:23.214 --> 41:24.516
Let's shall.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.684
CHARLIE:
What's going on here?

41:25.717 --> 41:27.553
Uh, we're going
to the movies.

41:27.586 --> 41:28.787
Mm-hmm.

41:28.820 --> 41:29.621
A movie?

41:29.655 --> 41:30.689
You and,

41:30.722 --> 41:31.923
and-and Mildred?

41:31.957 --> 41:34.192
- Uh, Millie.
- Millie. Thank you.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.728
Uh, Millie wanted to see, um...

41:36.762 --> 41:38.063
The new Double-O Seven film?

41:39.765 --> 41:41.032
Right.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.701
That's where
we're going.

41:42.734 --> 41:43.569
Okay?

41:44.636 --> 41:45.671
See you later.
Shall we?

41:45.704 --> 41:46.705
Yep.

41:46.738 --> 41:47.806
Good night.

41:47.839 --> 41:48.874
Bye.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.012
(door closes)

41:54.045 --> 41:55.547
"Millie."

41:55.581 --> 41:57.983
Yep, "Millie."

41:58.016 --> 42:01.787
Just think, she could be
your boss and your step-mom.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.922
(chuckles)

42:06.257 --> 42:09.828
* It's enough to make you cold

42:09.861 --> 42:12.230
* To realize
you're getting old *

42:12.263 --> 42:16.134
* You haven't found a place to
spend your life *

42:18.670 --> 42:21.673
* It's enough to make you ill

42:21.707 --> 42:23.975
* It's a tall and lonely hill

42:24.009 --> 42:26.778
* When you feel the need
to cry *

42:26.812 --> 42:28.780
* I'll be right by your side

42:28.814 --> 42:31.683
* Whenever you feel tired

42:31.717 --> 42:34.185
* I'll come and find you

42:34.219 --> 42:39.991
* Whenever you're alone,
I will be there *

42:40.025 --> 42:46.832
* Whatever dreams at night,
you don't have to cry *

42:46.865 --> 42:49.735
* Cry tonight

42:49.768 --> 42:52.638
* Don't say I'm half right

42:52.671 --> 42:55.874
* You don't have to cry

42:55.907 --> 42:58.710
* You don't have to cry

42:58.744 --> 43:01.613
* Cry tonight...
