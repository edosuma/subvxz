SWELL.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.003
OKAY, SHOW ME YOUR
FIGHTING STANCE.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.041
HOW'S THIS?

12:54.107 --> 12:57.277
GREAT, IF YOU'RE
FIGHTING THE EASTER BUNNY.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.280
ALRIGHT. NOW SHOW ME
YOUR FIGHTING STYLE.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.118
STEVE.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.419
STEVE.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.554
STEVE!

13:07.620 --> 13:08.956
HUH?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.924
THAT'S NOT
A FIGHTING STYLE.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.960
THAT'S A PLEA
FOR HELP.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.995
WELL, TEACH ME, CARL.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.097
ALRIGHT, I'LL TRY,

13:17.164 --> 13:20.000
BUT, STEVE,
I STRONGLY SUGGEST

13:20.067 --> 13:22.903
THAT YOU CONSIDER
A DIFFERENT STRATEGY.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.839
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO HIT YOUR OPPONENT, RUN.

13:25.906 --> 13:29.242
AH, SORT OF LIKE
AN URKEL SHUFFLE.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.310
RIGHT.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.511
I'LL WORK ON THAT,

13:31.578 --> 13:33.580
BUT COULD YOU SHOW ME
A FEW PUNCHES ANYWAY?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.548
OKAY, NOW, STEVE,

13:35.615 --> 13:38.952
A BOXER'S MOST
IMPORTANT PUNCH
IS THE JAB.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.989
IT'S A QUICK,
STRAIGHT BLOW
TO YOUR OPPONENT'S FACE.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.356
NOW LET'S
SEE YOUR JAB.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.231
HOW'S THAT?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.666
FINE, FINE.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.203
JUST NEXT TIME,
WAIT UNTIL I'M READY.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.938
OH, SORRY,
BIG GUY.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.173
ANOTHER GOOD PUNCH
IS THE LEFT HOOK.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.175
THE ARM TRAVELS IN A
CIRCULAR MOTION

14:02.242 --> 14:04.811
HOPEFULLY CONNECTING WITH
YOUR OPPONENT'S CHIN.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.079
AND IT'S A
REALLY GOOD PUNCH

14:06.146 --> 14:08.515
IF YOUR OPPONENT
IS JUST USING HIS JAB.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.354
SORRY, REFLEX.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.361
ANOTHER GOOD PUNCH
TO HAVE...

14:21.428 --> 14:23.463
IS THE RIGHT CROSS.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.998
IT'S A POWER MOVE--

14:25.065 --> 14:28.701
A KNOCK-YOU-OUT PUNCH.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.070
WHEN YOU SEE
AN OPENING,

14:30.137 --> 14:32.272
YOUR RIGHT HAND COMES
ACROSS YOUR LEFT HAND

14:32.339 --> 14:35.342
WITH ALL YOUR WEIGHT
BEHIND IT, LIKE THIS.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.077
DON'T OVERUSE
YOUR RIGHT CROSS.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.112
YOU WANNA SAVE THAT
FOR THE PERFECT MOMENT.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.780
YOU'LL MOSTLY BE RELYING

14:40.847 --> 14:42.282
ON YOUR LEFT HOOK
AND YOUR JAB.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.358
THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR THE DAY.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.266
I COULDN'T BELIEVE--
I COULDN'T--

14:59.332 --> 15:02.235
WHEN WE FINISHED
THAT MAMBO AND
EVERYBODY APPLAUDED,

15:02.302 --> 15:05.605
I WAS SO PROUD
I THOUGHT I'D BUST A GUT.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.507
BE HONEST, FLETCHER.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.677
THEY APPLAUDED
BECAUSE YOU SPLIT
YOUR PANTS.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.549
OH, FLETCHER, I HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.451
ME, TOO. GOODNIGHT.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.220
GOODNIGHT.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.601
AHEM.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.304
AHEM.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.738
OH, HI.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.507
HI.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.908
I'M CARL WINSLOW.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.244
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

15:44.311 --> 15:47.380
I'M FLETCHER THOMAS.
YOU MUST BE ESTELLE'S SON.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.382
SHE'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.119
OH, REALLY?
THAT'S FUNNY.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.787
SHE HASN'T MENTIONED
A THING ABOUT YOU.

15:54.854 --> 15:57.224
BY THE WAY,
I'M A COP.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.027
THAT'S NICE.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.462
WELL, GOODNIGHT AGAIN,
ESTELLE.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.198
GOODNIGHT, FLETCHER,
AND THANKS AGAIN

16:05.265 --> 16:08.068
FOR A WONDERFUL,
LOVELY EVENING.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.203
THE PLEASURE
WAS ALL MINE.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.645
PLEASURE?
WHAT PLEASURE?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.380
DON'T START WITH ME!

16:20.447 --> 16:21.948
WHAT--

16:22.015 --> 16:24.417
MAMA, YOU WERE
KISSING THAT MAN.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.885
SO?

16:25.952 --> 16:27.254
WELL, YOU'RE MY MOTHER.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.989
MOMS AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT STUFF.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.758
IF MOTHERS DIDN'T
DO THAT STUFF,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.026
YOU WOULDN'T
BE HERE.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.299
BUT--BUT...

16:39.366 --> 16:41.268
I THINK
I'M GETTING A HEADACHE.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.404
CARL, HONEY...

16:45.772 --> 16:47.240
FLETCHER'S
A GOOD MAN.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.742
HE ENJOYS
MY COMPANY,

16:49.809 --> 16:51.644
AND I ENJOY HIS.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.514
THAT'S GOOD, MAMA,
REALLY GOOD.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.715
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.716
BLESS YOU.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.518
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.788
FLETCHER THOMAS.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.790
YOU SURE THAT'S
HIS REAL NAME?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.225
YEAH.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.759
I'LL RUN
A MAKE ON HIM.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.103
HI, LAURA.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.705
HELLO, GREG.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.173
YOU OKAY?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.409
NO. IT BUGS ME
STEVE'S THE ONLY GUY

17:22.475 --> 17:24.644
WHO HAS GUTS TO
STAND UP TO WILLIE.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.515
YEAH.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.584
BOO! BOO!
BOO! BOO!

17:38.725 --> 17:39.659
ALRIGHT!

17:39.726 --> 17:42.162
YAY! YAY!
YAY! YAY!

17:44.164 --> 17:45.798
URKEL!
URKEL!
URKEL!

17:45.865 --> 17:47.467
URKEL!
URKEL!
URKEL!

17:49.369 --> 17:52.472
YAY! YAY!
YAY! YAY!

17:59.679 --> 18:02.849
RACHEL, DID STEVE LIKE
THE ROBE WE MADE HIM?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.517
YES. HE WAS
REALLY TOUCHED.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.820
AFTER THE FIGHT, HE WANTS
TO BE BURIED IN IT.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.122
[DING DING DING]

18:09.189 --> 18:12.292
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WHAT WE GOT HERE

18:12.359 --> 18:15.128
IS A THREE-ROUND
GRUDGE MATCH.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.363
IN THIS CORNER,

18:16.429 --> 18:19.366
WEIGHING IN
AT 142 POUNDS,

18:19.432 --> 18:22.702
"HURRICANE"
WILLIE FUFFNER!

18:22.769 --> 18:26.139
BOO! BOO!
HISS! HISS!

18:26.206 --> 18:28.708
AND IN THIS CORNER,

18:28.775 --> 18:32.412
AT 97 POUNDS
SOAKING WET,

18:33.280 --> 18:36.549
STEVE "THE IRON MAN" URKEL!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.618
YAY! YAY!
YAY! YAY!

18:44.257 --> 18:46.159
ALRIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
YOU HEAR THE BELL,

18:46.226 --> 18:48.195
YOU COME TO THE CENTER
OF THE RING,

18:48.261 --> 18:50.930
YOU TOUCH GLOVES,
YOU COMMENCE FIGHTING.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.532
[DING]

18:52.599 --> 18:55.302
OOH! OOH!
OOH! OOH!

18:55.368 --> 18:57.404
HE LASTED LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.272
1...2...

18:59.339 --> 19:00.840
STEVE, STEVE.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.475
NOT NOW. I'M BUSY.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.711
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
TRY THE URKEL SHUFFLE.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.679
RIGHT.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.150
ALRIGHT!

19:11.218 --> 19:12.652
YAY!
OH, YEAH!
YAY!

19:12.719 --> 19:14.587
COME ON, BABY.

19:16.789 --> 19:17.757
YAY!

19:39.312 --> 19:40.580
OH! OH!
OH! OH!

19:40.647 --> 19:41.814
1!

19:41.881 --> 19:42.849
2...

19:42.915 --> 19:44.851
STEVE!
KEEP GOING!

19:45.852 --> 19:47.254
I--I CAN'T.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.256
HE BROKE MY SHUFFLE.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.494
STEVE, I THINK WE SHOULD
THROW IN THE TOWEL.

19:54.561 --> 19:58.097
NO WAY. IF I CAN
HIT HIM ONCE WITH
ALL MY MIGHT

19:58.164 --> 19:59.932
WHY, I'LL DROP HIM
LIKE A BAD HABIT.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.035
COME ON! FIGHT!

20:03.102 --> 20:04.404
UHH!

20:08.207 --> 20:09.576
UH-OH!

20:12.245 --> 20:14.481
OH! OH!
OH! OH!

20:15.682 --> 20:17.484
OH! OH!
OH! OH!

20:18.651 --> 20:20.953
OH! OH!
OH! OH!

20:21.020 --> 20:21.954
1!

20:22.021 --> 20:22.989
STEVE!

20:23.055 --> 20:24.291
2!

20:24.357 --> 20:26.293
LAURA.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.395
OH, THERE'S
THREE OF YOU.

20:28.461 --> 20:32.399
OH, THE WORLD DOESN'T
DESERVE SUCH RICHES.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.101
STEVE, DON'T GET UP.
STAY DOWN.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.469
DON'T WORRY,
MY LITTLE--

20:36.536 --> 20:38.505
OH! OH!
OH! OH!

20:38.571 --> 20:40.473
WE'LL TALK LATER.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.709
YEAH!

20:42.775 --> 20:44.076
1!

20:44.143 --> 20:45.712
STEVE, STAY DOWN!

20:45.778 --> 20:47.146
STAY DOWN!

20:47.213 --> 20:48.881
OH, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

20:48.948 --> 20:51.851
SHE SAID, "STAY DOWN!"
SHE SAID, "STAY DOWN!"

20:56.289 --> 20:58.858
ALRIGHT, FUFFNER.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.159
QUIT STALLING.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.161
WHERE ARE YOU, HUH?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.030
AND NOW TAKE THAT

21:04.096 --> 21:06.265
AND A LITTLE
OF THAT, TOO.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.302
HOLD IT!

21:09.369 --> 21:11.671
WILLIE, I'M TIRED OF YOU
PUSHING US AROUND.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.773
IF URKEL CAN STAND UP
TO YOU SO CAN I.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.743
SO AFTER YOU FINISH HIM,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT ME.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.713
AFTER?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.148
AND THEN ME!

21:22.214 --> 21:23.616
AND THEN ME.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.718
COME ON.
I CAN TAKE YOU ALL ON.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.725
WHAT YOU GOING
TO DO NOW, WILLIE?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.596
RUN.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.031
ME, TOO, WILLIE.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.268
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

21:42.335 --> 21:43.770
THE FIGHT'S OVER.

21:43.836 --> 21:44.904
YES!

21:44.971 --> 21:45.938
WHOO!

21:46.005 --> 21:47.039
WHOO!

21:50.176 --> 21:51.844
STEVE, ARE YOU OKAY?

21:51.911 --> 21:52.879
HUH?

21:52.945 --> 21:54.514
I SEEM TO BE
ALRIGHT.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.716
I DON'T SEEM
TO BE HALLUCINATING

21:56.783 --> 22:00.119
OR EXPERIENCING ANY OTHER
SIGNS OF A CONCUSSION.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.421
OHH.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.456
LAURA, IF YOU
STILL WANT ME

22:03.523 --> 22:05.892
TO GO TO THE DANCE
WITH YOU, I'D LIKE TO.

22:05.958 --> 22:09.896
THANKS, BUT I'VE DECIDED
TO GO WITH MY CHAMPION.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.932
STEVE, WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO
THE SADIE HAWKINS DAY DANCE?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.168
OH, NO. I WAS WRONG.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.670
I AM HALLUCINATING.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.607
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

22:20.673 --> 22:22.475
THE WINNER
BY A PRINCIPLE,

22:22.542 --> 22:25.378
STEVE "IRON MAN"
URKEL!

22:25.445 --> 22:27.580
YAY! YAY!
YAY! YAY!
