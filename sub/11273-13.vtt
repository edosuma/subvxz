WEBVTT

00:06.888 --> 00:09.527
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.766
Oh, come on, what kind
of a greeting is that?

00:12.928 --> 00:17.638
When Norm comes in, you all yell,
"Norm," make a big fuss over him.

00:17.808 --> 00:21.039
ls it asking too much for me to get
the same treatment once in a while?

00:21.248 --> 00:24.877
- She's right. Try it again, sweetheart.
- Yeah. Thanks.

00:27.128 --> 00:30.723
- Hello, everyone.
- Norm!

00:31.128 --> 00:33.483
That's better.

01:51.368 --> 01:53.563
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

01:53.871 --> 01:57.705
- How's life, Mr Peterson?
- l'm waiting for the movie.

01:58.126 --> 01:59.605
Normie, you're in early tonight.

01:59.836 --> 02:02.396
Yeah, l wanted to talk to you guys
before this evening.

02:03.466 --> 02:04.660
What's this evening?

02:04.884 --> 02:07.682
Well, l'm meeting a prospective
client and his wife here.

02:08.013 --> 02:11.323
He runs a huge dairy. He's looking for
someone to take care of his books.

02:11.642 --> 02:16.511
All right. He wants to squeeze a little
bit more out of his taxes there, huh?

02:16.898 --> 02:18.934
That's a very funny joke, Mr Clavin.

02:19.234 --> 02:21.543
- You got any udders?
- "Udders."

02:21.821 --> 02:25.973
All right, guys. This is exactly
the kind of sparkling wit

02:26.326 --> 02:28.396
that l'm talking about, okay?

02:28.662 --> 02:30.812
Now, it's really important
that l impress these people,

02:31.081 --> 02:34.118
so l'd appreciate it if you'd kind of
leave me alone with the Brubakers.

02:34.711 --> 02:36.349
Yeah, yeah. Listen to the man, fellas.

02:36.630 --> 02:39.986
Don't worry, Normie,
l'll keep them away from us.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.231
All right, Cliff, that last comment was
specifically addressed to you, okay?

02:46.516 --> 02:47.995
What are you saying, Norm?

02:48.227 --> 02:50.821
What, you're ashamed of your
best friend, huh?

02:51.105 --> 02:54.222
Afraid l'm gonna embarrass you?
Afraid l'm gonna be a big bore?

02:54.568 --> 02:56.365
Thanks for understanding, Cliff.

02:56.612 --> 03:00.002
All right. All right, Norm,
my lips are sealed.

03:00.324 --> 03:05.682
l'm mute. You won't hear another word
out of me on any subject.

03:06.081 --> 03:07.673
How did you do it?

03:09.085 --> 03:11.883
Sam, l'm going to have to take
a couple hours off this evening.

03:12.172 --> 03:15.847
Wait a minute. Our absentee
waitress strikes again?

03:16.176 --> 03:18.007
What is it this time, bleach-bag?

03:18.554 --> 03:21.193
Hey, hey. Carla, do you mind?
l'm the employer here.

03:21.474 --> 03:24.705
l'll handle this.
What is it this time, bleach-bag?

03:25.854 --> 03:30.882
l volunteered to work the first two-hour
shift on an auction for public television.

03:31.319 --> 03:33.787
- You'll be on TV? No kidding, huh?
- Yeah.

03:34.114 --> 03:37.550
They're selling off celebrity belongings
from the Boston area.

03:38.035 --> 03:42.551
We have a baton that Leinsdorf used,
a letter from Henry Cabot Lodge--

03:42.916 --> 03:46.113
- And nothing from Sam Malone?
- Come on.

03:46.462 --> 03:47.736
Not such a crazy idea.

03:47.964 --> 03:54.278
As a matter of fact, some fellows
named Yastrzemski, Bobby Orr,

03:54.763 --> 03:58.438
- something like Havlicek...
- Yeah.

03:58.810 --> 04:02.086
...have donated their athletic
accoutrements.

04:03.482 --> 04:05.552
Would you be interested, Sam?

04:05.818 --> 04:07.695
Come on. l mean,
l was a good athlete,

04:07.946 --> 04:10.380
but, l mean, those guys
are superstars.

04:10.699 --> 04:12.815
Well, to some of us,
you are too, Sammy.

04:13.077 --> 04:15.637
Yeah, Sam, you may not have been
out there as long as those guys,

04:15.913 --> 04:17.551
but you were loved.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.906
- Please. Please.
- Go ahead. Don't be embarrassed.

04:20.209 --> 04:23.486
No, no. l mean, please, a little louder.
The rest of the bar didn't hear.

04:24.549 --> 04:26.744
- Then you'll do it?
- Yeah, if it's for a worthy cause,

04:27.010 --> 04:29.080
l guess l could give them
my old jersey.

04:29.346 --> 04:32.338
You know, old number 1 6.
Yeah, l'm gonna do it.

04:32.641 --> 04:34.916
l'll make a call, and--
You know, l'll tell you what.

04:35.186 --> 04:38.735
lf this sells, maybe l could give them
some more of my athletic equipment.

04:39.066 --> 04:43.617
While you're at it, Sam, why don't you
give them one of your old jockstraps.

04:44.822 --> 04:47.416
No. Too many memories.

04:53.666 --> 04:56.134
Now, come on, all you baseball
fans out there. Our celebrities--

04:56.419 --> 04:58.011
Hey, Sam, have they sold
your jersey yet?

04:58.255 --> 05:01.406
Are you kidding? lt's been on sale
for half an hour.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.989
Sam's fans are probably clogging
the switchboard.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.492
Come on, Carla, let's not
get carried away here.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.365
- Mr Brubaker?
- Peterson?

05:08.601 --> 05:10.273
Yes, Norm Peterson. Yes. Hi.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.350
- This must be the lovely wife.
- Yes.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.516
How do you do, ma'am.

05:14.774 --> 05:16.287
Well, come on in, folks.

05:16.527 --> 05:19.360
We have just a few moments
till our table's ready upstairs.

05:19.655 --> 05:22.488
And we can just have a drink here
and get acquainted.

05:22.992 --> 05:25.381
Just have a seat, folks.
This is Cheers.

05:25.662 --> 05:29.450
l think you'll find it a friendly, warm,
pub-like atmosphere.

05:29.792 --> 05:31.111
l hate bars.

05:31.377 --> 05:34.130
Well, l think they should
be abolished, actually.

05:34.423 --> 05:36.493
But we just have to be here
a few moments.

05:36.759 --> 05:40.195
Then we can go on upstairs
and strap on the old feedbag.

05:40.555 --> 05:44.833
- There are a lot of things l can't eat.
- Yes, we're both very careful.

05:45.227 --> 05:48.856
Well, l have a very sensitive
stomach myself, so...

05:49.941 --> 05:54.298
Good news. We just got in those taco-
flavoured pork rinds you love so much.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.490
Friendly serving wench, you know.

05:59.953 --> 06:02.262
Now, come on, all you
baseball fans out there.

06:02.706 --> 06:04.617
l'm sure one ofyou wanna
make a bid on this

06:04.875 --> 06:06.911
priceless piece ofbaseball
memorabilia

06:07.170 --> 06:11.004
donated by ex-Red Sox star
Sam Maloney.

06:11.383 --> 06:14.375
- That's "Malone."
- Oh, yes. Thank you for that.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.439
Perhaps we should meet
some of our volunteers now.

06:17.724 --> 06:21.512
- And what is your name, miss?
- Diane Chambers.

06:22.604 --> 06:25.914
l wasjust giggling with one
of our callers over ajoke

06:26.234 --> 06:29.465
- that l'd love to share with you, Bob.
- Well, please.

06:30.322 --> 06:35.601
How many Surrealists does it take
to screw in a light bulb ?

06:36.871 --> 06:39.988
- How many?
- The fish.

06:46.257 --> 06:49.090
l guess Surrealistic humour
isn't your cup offur.

06:55.059 --> 06:58.415
Mr Brubaker, would you tell me
a little bit about the dairy game?

06:58.730 --> 07:00.766
l've always felt it must
be really fascinating.

07:01.066 --> 07:03.819
Really? Why would you think that?

07:06.531 --> 07:07.805
l...

07:09.034 --> 07:11.389
Because of all the different products.

07:12.121 --> 07:17.559
You have, you know, your milk,
cheese and...

07:20.297 --> 07:23.334
Now, we still have yet to receive
a single offer for this

07:23.676 --> 07:27.635
authentic old baseball shirt.

07:27.973 --> 07:33.093
Double-stitched. A very nice garment,
even ifyou're not a baseball fan.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.751
- l have a bid, Bob.
- You do? How much?

07:36.024 --> 07:38.140
- A hundred dollars, Bob.
- Wonderful.

07:38.402 --> 07:42.953
Well, there's a very generous offer.
Going once, twice, sold.

07:43.408 --> 07:47.037
- Yeah!
- All right! Yeah.

07:47.371 --> 07:49.168
That's not too bad.
A hundred big ones.

07:49.415 --> 07:51.883
- Yeah, way to go, Sam.
- Mayday's back, huh?

07:52.210 --> 07:55.964
l just feel good to be able to do
something to help out quality television.

07:56.298 --> 07:58.892
l think maybe we should start
watching this station more often.

07:59.177 --> 08:02.214
Well, enough of this pledge break.
Let's get back to our program.

08:02.514 --> 08:05.870
Hydro-Mulching:
How Much? How Soon?

08:06.936 --> 08:09.404
Okay, wrestling.

08:15.404 --> 08:18.441
- Hi, Sam. l'm back.
- Hey, get in here.

08:18.741 --> 08:20.732
So, what'd you think, huh?
Hundred bucks.

08:20.994 --> 08:22.393
That's not too bad, is it?

08:23.163 --> 08:26.758
Yes, the station asked me
to convey their appreciation

08:27.085 --> 08:29.474
- to you for helping them out.
- Oh, well, l was glad to.

08:29.754 --> 08:32.109
l mean, that's my favourite station.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.655
- lt is?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:33.884 --> 08:37.193
l especially like those two guys
that talk about the day's events.

08:37.764 --> 08:42.554
- MacNeil, Lehrer?
- No, no. Bert and Ernie.

08:42.937 --> 08:46.009
Oh, wait a minute. Unless...
Maybe that's their last names.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.200
- Could be.
- Anyway, listen.

08:48.443 --> 08:51.560
l was thinking maybe l should donate
a few more of my baseball treasures.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.094
You know, like,
l got some hats in here.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.085
- No.
- Sam. Sam.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.963
- l really don't think that's necessary.
- Oh, hey, listen.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.885
We got 1 00 bucks for my jersey.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.242
We could be looking at a thou for
the whole Sam Malone package.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.423
Let me just call these folks here.

09:09.802 --> 09:11.679
l bought the jersey.

09:12.972 --> 09:16.442
- You did?
- Yes, l did.

09:17.519 --> 09:19.555
Well, l know you don't
like to sleep alone,

09:19.813 --> 09:22.327
but why didn't you come to me?

09:24.778 --> 09:28.896
l couldn't bear just seeing it sit there
and nobody bidding on it.

09:29.241 --> 09:32.790
l felt sort of responsible,
and the station let me buy it.

09:33.413 --> 09:36.644
Well, why'd you do that? l mean,
you barely gave it a chance, really.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.831
What difference does it make?
lt's over.

09:39.086 --> 09:42.556
The station has their money,
and you have your jersey back.

09:43.591 --> 09:45.468
Well...

09:46.261 --> 09:48.821
No, l want you to take that back.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.030
Truth is, l haven't thought
about baseball in a long time.

09:53.353 --> 09:56.948
Seeing that jersey up there
with all those great athletes' stuff

09:57.274 --> 09:59.834
just, you know, kind of got
my juices going again.

10:00.153 --> 10:02.542
Come on, take it back.
lt'll sell. l know it will.

10:02.864 --> 10:05.424
- Come on.
- Okay, Sam. Sure.

10:05.701 --> 10:07.259
- Maybe it will.
- Yeah.

10:07.495 --> 10:11.932
- Maybe l responded prematurely.
- Thank you.

10:12.334 --> 10:15.531
l'll leave it up there until it sells
or ends up on Mr. Bobo's table.

10:15.838 --> 10:18.511
There you-- There you go.
That's the spirit.

10:21.594 --> 10:24.631
Diane? Can l...?

10:25.641 --> 10:28.758
- Yes, Sam.
- l'm sorry, whose table?

10:32.649 --> 10:35.607
Mr. Bobo's table.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.179
- What's that?
- That's where things are put

10:39.491 --> 10:41.243
when they aren't sold.

10:42.995 --> 10:45.145
- Well, then what happens?
- You don't wanna know.

10:45.414 --> 10:48.167
Yes, l do. Tell me.

10:48.460 --> 10:53.170
ln the last ten minutes of the telethon,
a chimpanzee, Mr. Bobo,

10:55.301 --> 10:57.940
draws viewers' names
out of a coconut,

10:58.221 --> 11:01.019
and they give the things away.

11:02.768 --> 11:04.326
You mean that egghead
station of yours

11:04.562 --> 11:07.634
lets some dumb animal choose
who gets the prizes?

11:08.275 --> 11:10.470
That "dumb animal,"
as you called him,

11:10.736 --> 11:14.490
was part of a language experiment
at Cornell University.

11:14.824 --> 11:17.782
He has a vocabulary of 500 words.

11:18.286 --> 11:22.598
Five-- Oh, come on, Diane,
l find that completely...

11:25.128 --> 11:28.086
- l'd better hurry.
- Yeah, hurry.

11:28.382 --> 11:31.977
Wait. Dubious! Yeah, dubious.

11:32.303 --> 11:34.055
Volunteers are standing by
to take your calls.

11:34.305 --> 11:37.297
Sam, l'm getting a little worried.
Nobody's made a bid on your jersey

11:37.601 --> 11:40.320
- since they put it back on sale.
- lt's only been an hour.

11:40.646 --> 11:42.284
They just gotta give it a chance,
that's all.

11:42.565 --> 11:45.796
--keep this station alive.
Oh, and look who's here.

11:46.111 --> 11:49.467
lt's Mr. Bobo. lsn't he impressive?

11:49.782 --> 11:53.695
We'll be seeing more of Mr. Bobo
in the later stages of our auction.

11:54.079 --> 11:55.797
Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Bobo.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.887
You know, all of a sudden,
l don't think l can stick it out

11:59.168 --> 12:00.396
and watch that old jersey sell.

12:00.628 --> 12:02.778
l'm getting kind of sentimental.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.242
Just wish somebody would
buy the damn thing.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.261
Oh, what are you worried about?

12:07.511 --> 12:11.265
There are thousands of baseball fans
out there who remember Sam Malone

12:11.599 --> 12:13.794
and who would kill to have
a souvenir of him.

12:14.436 --> 12:17.667
Carla, from your lips to God's ears.
l think somebody's making a bid there.

12:17.982 --> 12:20.371
Well, this is interesting.
We have a lady on the phone

12:20.652 --> 12:25.772
who wants to buy old number 16
here for the sum of$200.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.889
All right, huh?

12:29.162 --> 12:32.279
That's just wonderful.
l'm going to tell Sam personally.

12:33.500 --> 12:39.848
No, no. No check. l'll pay cash
and pick up the jersey later.

12:48.848 --> 12:50.361
Damn.

12:51.390 --> 12:54.109
- lt's all right. l don't blame you.
- Yeah.

12:54.391 --> 12:56.700
After all, we both had the same fear,
that it wouldn't sell,

12:56.975 --> 12:59.250
and you'd be humiliated.

12:59.934 --> 13:01.572
Shamed.

13:02.227 --> 13:04.946
- Disgraced in front of--
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:06.144 --> 13:09.659
You know, they used to cheer
when l walked out of the bullpen.

13:09.979 --> 13:14.018
l mean, just the sight of old
number 1 6 would start them off.

13:14.355 --> 13:16.915
Now, see, those were great days.

13:17.231 --> 13:21.463
Yes, they were. But you have
more great days ahead.

13:21.816 --> 13:24.694
You have a real job now, and friends.

13:24.983 --> 13:27.292
And you've got your health.

13:28.234 --> 13:29.986
God, that's low.

13:30.735 --> 13:32.965
- What is?
- The health crack.

13:33.277 --> 13:35.188
- Well, all l meant was--
- l know what you meant.

13:35.444 --> 13:38.800
That was pity talking. You don't tell
somebody they still have their health

13:39.112 --> 13:41.421
unless what you mean is
that's all they've got.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.766
- Forget l said it.
- No, l'm not gonna forget it.

13:44.072 --> 13:47.064
You told me l had good health.
l'm not gonna take that.

13:49.115 --> 13:51.948
- Sam, you're sick.
- lt's too late to make up.

13:52.241 --> 13:54.801
You know something?
You were pitying me,

13:55.075 --> 13:57.714
and if there's one thing l can't
stand from you, it's pity.

13:57.992 --> 14:01.905
You know, what the hell. l'm gonna
put that jersey back in the auction.

14:02.244 --> 14:05.236
- And it's gonna sell.
- Well, l hope it does.

14:05.536 --> 14:08.255
No, it's gonna sell because
l said it's gonna sell.

14:08.829 --> 14:12.424
Thank you very much for reminding
me that l have a little self-respect left.

14:12.746 --> 14:14.941
That l have some pride
in who l am. Hello?

14:15.205 --> 14:18.038
l'd like to return that
young man's jersey.

14:18.873 --> 14:21.831
And so the woodchuck says
to the lumberjack,

14:22.166 --> 14:24.680
"l was talking to the log."

14:25.500 --> 14:29.288
l never much cared for jokes
in which animals speak.

14:30.128 --> 14:31.846
- Let's go.
- No, no. Neither do l.

14:32.008 --> 14:36.081
l used that as a kind of awful joke
a mediocre accountant might use.

14:37.848 --> 14:39.679
Can we have some coffee?
What do you say?

14:39.848 --> 14:41.520
No, thank you. lt keeps me awake.

14:41.808 --> 14:44.242
Well, l can see why you
wouldn't want that.

14:44.408 --> 14:47.764
No, sir. Come on. We haven't
discussed business at all, sir.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.378
l really think we ought to just have a
spot of something. What do you say?

14:51.657 --> 14:54.649
- Well, l'd like a glass of water.
- Specialty of the house.

14:54.939 --> 14:57.851
Come on, sit down. Sit down,
and l'll just run up to the bar

14:58.138 --> 15:00.094
and get it myself.
lt'll be much quicker that way.

15:00.339 --> 15:03.092
Just keep the old party going,
you know.

15:03.372 --> 15:06.762
Cliff. Man, l'm in Death Valley
over here.

15:07.069 --> 15:08.821
Help me out. Woody,
give me a glass of water.

15:09.063 --> 15:12.533
Just help me out, will you? Just
come on over and just talk a little bit.

15:12.885 --> 15:18.039
Who, me, Norm? The laughingstock,
windbag, the boob?

15:18.576 --> 15:21.932
All right, l'm really sorry for whatever
l may have said this afternoon.

15:22.232 --> 15:24.382
l just didn't know what these
people would be like.

15:24.641 --> 15:26.233
Oh, yeah? What are they like, Norm?

15:26.469 --> 15:28.027
They're like...

15:28.338 --> 15:31.171
Like dead people without the rouge.

15:33.739 --> 15:37.095
Sorry, Norm. Can't help you out.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.146
All right, there's something
you should know.

15:39.388 --> 15:43.427
Listen, l found out over dinner that
both their fathers were postmen.

15:45.786 --> 15:47.856
Postal brats?

15:48.154 --> 15:50.622
Normie, Normie, Normie,
you should have said so.

15:50.895 --> 15:54.046
Stand aside, me bucko,
and l'll take care of the rest.

15:55.673 --> 15:58.824
So your parents wore
the colours, huh?

15:59.121 --> 16:03.672
Well, l didn't follow my father into
the service. And Henry's in milk.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.976
Oh, well, that explains
the lovely complexion.

16:07.304 --> 16:10.421
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, yeah, yours too.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.219
So, you know, speaking of milk,
here's a little-known fact.

16:14.868 --> 16:18.262
The cow was domesticated
by the Mesopotamians.

16:18.263 --> 16:20.499
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, that's right.

16:20.657 --> 16:24.051
In fact, it wasn't originally
a milk-bearing animal. Oh, no.

16:24.052 --> 16:26.999
It was originally used as a guard animal
for the Chinese emperors

16:27.047 --> 16:30.441
during the Chung King dynasty.

16:30.442 --> 16:33.835
Just when you think
you know an animal.

16:33.836 --> 16:37.230
Well, allow me to elucidate.

16:37.231 --> 16:40.625
Thank you, Norm.
Get me a beer, will you?

16:40.626 --> 16:42.000
Yeah. Theory was that the intruder
would step on a cowpie...

16:42.021 --> 16:43.500
- How we doing?
- Great.

16:43.515 --> 16:46.909
- They keep talking about your jersey.
- Really?

16:46.910 --> 16:50.304
And still no bids for the jersey
time forgot.

16:50.305 --> 16:53.699
- Donations can be made by check...
- I'd make a big donation

16:53.700 --> 16:57.093
if I could go a couple of rounds
with that guy.

16:57.094 --> 17:00.488
Sam, would you relax? I'm your
biggest fan, I'm not worried.

17:00.489 --> 17:03.000
That jersey is gonna sell,
and for a wad.

17:03.084 --> 17:06.478
- You think so?
- Absolutely. Money in the bank.

17:06.479 --> 17:09.872
Just stop doubting yourself
and trust me.

17:09.873 --> 17:11.500
You're right. What am I doing?

17:11.568 --> 17:14.962
Woody, how much have we raised?

17:14.963 --> 17:18.357
We got $116 and a pledge
for a quart of buttermilk.

17:18.358 --> 17:21.751
What are you do--?
What's going on?

17:21.752 --> 17:25.146
Oh, Sam, we're just trying to help.

17:25.146 --> 17:28.540
Well, I don't need your help.

17:28.541 --> 17:31.936
Nobody goes near the telephone.
You hear me? Nobody.

17:31.937 --> 17:35.330
Well, I think we're gonna
have to move on.

17:35.331 --> 17:38.725
I'm afraid we're gonna have to take the
Malone jersey off the bidding table

17:38.726 --> 17:42.120
to make room for this ingenious
potato-powered clock.

17:43.821 --> 17:47.214
We'll be seeing more of the jersey
on Mr. Bobo's portion of the show.

17:47.215 --> 17:50.609
One of the things folks love
about public television

17:50.610 --> 17:54.004
- is the fact we show no commercials.
- Sam, I'm sorry.

17:54.005 --> 17:57.399
That's okay. Well.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.793
This is it, huh? The end of an era.

18:02.394 --> 18:05.788
Well, maybe I can finally put my
career in perspective.

18:05.789 --> 18:09.183
Enjoy it for what it was.

18:09.184 --> 18:12.578
I was a small player in a big town.
But that's okay. That's okay. I had--

18:14.079 --> 18:17.472
I had some laughs, some good times,
some bad times.

18:19.073 --> 18:23.467
And now, I guess I'm no longer
Sam Malone, ex-baseball player.

18:24.168 --> 18:28.562
I'm Sam Malone,
ex-ex-baseball player.

18:29.063 --> 18:32.457
Just an average guy doing
an average job.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.851
That's something I can be proud of.

18:35.852 --> 18:39.246
Hold everything. We've had a $300
bid on Sam Malone's jersey.

18:39.247 --> 18:42.641
All right! Oh, I own this burg!

18:42.642 --> 18:46.036
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Sam...

18:46.037 --> 18:47.430
Did any of you do it?

18:47.431 --> 18:50.825
Come on, just admit it
if you did it. Please.

18:50.826 --> 18:54.220
Honest, Sam. Nobody here bought it.

18:54.221 --> 18:57.615
Hey, do you think we have enough
for that potato-powered clock?

18:57.616 --> 19:01.009
They bought my jersey.
Three hundred bucks.

19:01.010 --> 19:03.404
Sammy, I got a great idea.

19:03.405 --> 19:05.799
Why don't you call, have that guy
who bought it come here.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.193
- You could autograph it for him.
- You can take pictures,

19:09.194 --> 19:11.000
- send them to the newspaper.
- That's a good idea.

19:11.001 --> 19:14.000
It's a terrible idea. Sam, don't you see
what's happening?

19:14.084 --> 19:17.478
- What?
- This is a last desperate grasp

19:17.479 --> 19:20.872
- at glory that you just said was over.
- Oh, come on. Lighten up, will you?

19:20.873 --> 19:24.267
Do you have to take the fun
out of everything?

19:24.268 --> 19:27.662
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You do.

19:29.063 --> 19:32.457
You're a delight, Clifford.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.851
Oh, enchanté, Enid.

19:35.852 --> 19:36.500
Drive carefully, huh?

19:36.647 --> 19:40.041
What? What? Where are they going?
Where are they going?

19:40.042 --> 19:42.000
Henry's gotta get up
early in the morning,

19:42.037 --> 19:44.000
and Enid's sciatica's flaring up again.

19:44.031 --> 19:46.425
Oh, what that woman endures.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.820
Forget her, what about me?
Did I get the job?

19:48.821 --> 19:52.215
Oh, jeez, Norm.
Norm, I forgot to ask.

19:52.216 --> 19:56.609
Hey, look, don't worry.
I'll bring it up this weekend.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.004
This weekend?

19:58.005 --> 20:00.399
Yeah, they invited me up to the farm.

20:00.400 --> 20:06.794
Forty-eight hours of Charades,
food and Yahtzee.

20:13.039 --> 20:15.599
- Sam Malone?
-Yeah. Hey, everybody.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.962
- I want you to meet a Mayday fan.
- I'm Bert Simpson.

20:17.500 --> 20:23.000
Bert, hi. Sam Malone. Oh, Diane,
come on over here and meet Bert.

20:23.339 --> 20:25.529
- Hello, Bert?
- How are you?

20:25.762 --> 20:27.912
Well, this must be pretty thrilling
for you.

20:28.205 --> 20:30.135
- Did you see me pitch at Fenway?
- No.

20:30.618 --> 20:33.168
- Caught me on the tube then, huh?
- Not really.

20:34.062 --> 20:36.462
Actually, I've never heard of you.

20:36.505 --> 20:40.215
But to tell the truth, I wouldn't know
a baseball from a meatball.

20:40.938 --> 20:47.078
Boy, catch me having spaghetti
at his house.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.021
Why don't you just let me sign
that thing for you,

20:49.100 --> 20:51.000
and you can get the hell
out of here.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.648
I have no interest in that.
I thought you might like it back.

20:53.661 --> 20:56.200
Why did you buy it
if you didn't want it?

20:56.201 --> 20:58.064
Oh, frankly, it was
getting on my nerves.

20:58.100 --> 21:03.037
I mean, the thing kept coming back.

21:03.300 --> 21:07.631
Finally I said to myself,
"It's for a worthy cause.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.667
Put the damn thing
out of its misery."

21:15.000 --> 21:18.100
Excuse me.
Can I see you in my office?

21:18.704 --> 21:20.374
Gee, Sam, I'm awfully busy
right now.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.807
No hurry. Whenever you have
a minute.

21:23.570 --> 21:28.940
- Now, Sam--
- Relax, relax. What's the matter?

21:30.003 --> 21:34.173
You're upset. You're humiliated.

21:34.437 --> 21:36.000
And you're angry.

21:36.001 --> 21:40.240
This shirt thing has been an emotional
roller coaster for you,

21:40.303 --> 21:44.143
and you want someone on whom
to vent your frustration.

21:44.736 --> 21:50.246
Come on, take a look at me.
Do I look upset? Do I look angry?

21:50.369 --> 21:53.279
- Then why'd you drag me in here?
- Well, because I know

21:53.300 --> 21:56.073
that you were just dying
to call me a big dope.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.696
- No. Not me.
- Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.179
I thought I'd give you a chance
to do it privately.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.300
- I see what you're doing.
- What?

22:05.336 --> 22:09.496
You want an excuse to blow up
and let it all out so you'll feel better.

22:09.769 --> 22:14.769
And you want me to provide the
excuse. Well, I'm not falling for that.

22:15.202 --> 22:16.600
I am not gonna blow up.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.505
I just think that we're not gonna
be able to lay this thing to rest

22:18.700 --> 22:20.209
until you call me a big dope.

22:20.502 --> 22:23.092
It's what's in your mind,
so why not just say it.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.525
Get it over with, and we'll go on
with our lives.

22:27.368 --> 22:30.638
No.

22:30.792 --> 22:38.962
Well, I really wish you would. I think
it would be good for me to hear.

22:37.235 --> 22:40.125
- Well, maybe you should--
- I knew it!

22:40.668 --> 22:43.018
I knew it! I knew you couldn't keep
your big fat mouth shut.

22:43.101 --> 22:45.651
Oh, God, you think you know
everything, don't you?

22:45.700 --> 22:48.934
In your entire life, you've never said,
"I don't know," or, "I think this."

22:49.968 --> 22:53.378
Or, "In my humble opinion."
Oh, no, you always just say this.

22:53.401 --> 22:56.291
And you just say that. This, that!
This, that! You know, you're nuts.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.000
You are crazy. And in your twisted
little mind, you probably think

22:59.001 --> 23:01.517
you're gonna make me crazy
just like you made Frasier crazy,

23:01.701 --> 23:04.241
just like you make everybody crazy.
But you won't make me crazy.

23:04.333 --> 23:07.264
You wanna know why?
I'm gonna tell you why.

23:07.265 --> 23:10.300
Are you listening? Here it comes.
I don't know!

23:10.301 --> 23:13.000
I'll tell you something else.
You don't know either.

23:13.001 --> 23:15.864
Nobody knows why you're
not gonna make me crazy.

23:15.867 --> 23:21.757
So stick that in your hat
and smoke it.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.030
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
