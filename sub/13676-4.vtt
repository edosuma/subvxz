Actually, I don't think
the Boswells ever did this one.

-Are you sure? I seem to...
-No,

07:42.546 --> 07:44.047
the Andrew Sisters did it.

Our arrangement is sort
of a combination of them,

All right, well, I seem to recall
that the Boswells did it and they did it better.

-All right.
-Everything's better with hot sauce on it

07:55.768 --> 07:58.134

better if it comes out of Louisiana. So...

-Well, yeah.
-Yeah, you're right.

You know what?
With them it doesn't really matter

08:15.788 --> 08:17.278
'cause they left their mark.

You know? They left something behind.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.651
Huh.

we don't want to get in your way.

the work you did on Glover was first-rate.

That's Robert
throwing every lick he could into 12 bars.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.940
But, listen, the lesson today was

12:24.036 --> 12:26.402
to play a blues and only
change one or two notes

12:26.496 --> 12:27.827
in the standard phrase.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.780
Now, you can flat the third,

12:29.875 --> 12:31.991
you can go to the second
for the dominant fifth.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.621

You just change one or two notes.

'cause I didn't want your sister
to go reschedule Father Marcus.

14:11.059 --> 14:16.520
The only reason that man agreed to do it at all
was out of respect for your mother.

The truth is, this house ain't finished

and replace them original tiles.

No, Pop.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.722
It's rusted out.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.344
You got to deal with that or we're gonna have
water down the back wall.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.971
You should have seen it
when you were up there with the branch.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.645
Okay, I got all that.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.490

-No later than you.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.141
So I'm just cleaning up from that.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.967

I actually need to get with you about that.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.141
Yeah?

that program going fon/vard.

and we can't figure out a way to do that?

down at Camanida Pass

28:12.400 --> 28:15.858
I hope some of this beauty will last

28:16.112 --> 28:20.025
But, Lord, it's changing so damn fast

28:20.116 --> 28:22.778
Each and every day

28:24.745 --> 28:28.283

28:32.461 --> 28:35.874
But they're harder to find one and all

28:48.978 --> 28:52.687

28:52.815 --> 28:56.103
I've got nothing left to lose

28:58.029 --> 29:03.399
So there were, in actuality,
never any bullets suitable for comparison?

29:03.492 --> 29:06.529
No. No, Iwas trying to suss out
whether I was working in a unit

29:06.621 --> 29:10.830
that was committed to investigating
possible murders by NOPD officers

29:10.917 --> 29:13.499
or whether the unit
was engaged in covering up those murders.

29:13.586 --> 29:16.919
-And one of the bullets disappeared?
-Yes, as to prevent comparison.

29:17.006 --> 29:17.961
What would you have done

29:18.049 --> 29:20.335
if the bullet hadn't disappeared
on the way to the Jeff Parish lab?

29:20.426 --> 29:22.587
Would you have allowed
a false comparison to stand?

29:22.678 --> 29:25.841
Well, of course not. It was in no way
an attempt to manufacture evidence.

29:28.684 --> 29:32.427
Look, you get me on the stand,
I will explain exactly what I did and why.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.681
And I will further testify

29:33.773 --> 29:37.231
about the climate of obstruction
and corruption within the homicide unit.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.276
After which, one defense attorney
after the next will impeach you.

29:40.363 --> 29:41.944
Makes for a circular argument.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.113
I think the jury buys Terry as honest.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.111
I think the explanation works.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.533
Maybe, maybe not.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.576
But it might serve us better
just to leave it alone.

29:49.664 --> 29:52.952
The defense counsel will more than likely
look at this ballistics report,

29:53.042 --> 29:55.658
see more missing evidence
and let a sleeping dog lie.

29:55.753 --> 30:00.087

I will lay these motherfuckers out.

33:50.404 --> 33:53.487

walks into the outer office,

toss it in a trash can in the corner.

Any point picking up any of that real estate?

35:40.222 --> 35:43.714

the back end of the French Quarter maybe.

support the Jazz Center,

we can't be jamming clubs in
