THINK THAT'S GROSS.

00:15.648 --> 00:16.750
I STILL WANT TO.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.284
I HAD TO WAIT
TWO CENTURIES

00:18.351 --> 00:20.286
TO HAVE THE "CROMWELL

00:20.353 --> 00:21.755

THE POINT IS,
THESE THINGS

GO IN AND OUT OF STYLE.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.164
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER YOU'RE
BUILT FOR THE LONG HAUL.

WELL, I THINK
IT'S COOL

00:32.732 --> 00:36.603

TWO YEARS, FINE, I WILL.

00:36.669 --> 00:40.106
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE
EVERYTHING PIERCED.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.413
OKAY, VERY FUNNY.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.348
NOW, REMOVE THE BONE.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.471
IS BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.173
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS!

08:05.251 --> 08:06.219
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

08:06.285 --> 08:07.854
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE OFF.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.856
I HAVE TO GO TO TEXAS
THIS WEEKEND.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.524
WE CAN'T LEAVE
SABRINA ALONE.

08:11.591 --> 08:15.261
THEN WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE
SHE CAN STAY WITH.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.530
MAYBE I CAN BE OF HELP.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.933
JENNY JUST GAVE ME
THE BAD NEWS.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.935
I HAVE TO READ
50 PAGES BY MONDAY.

08:23.002 --> 08:23.936
<i>QUEL</i> DRAG.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.571
UM, SABRINA,
SINCE HILDA AND I

08:25.638 --> 08:27.607
HAVE TO WORK,
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

08:27.673 --> 08:29.609
ABOUT SPENDING THE WEEKEND

08:29.675 --> 08:31.744
AT YOUR AUNT VESTA'S
PLEASUREDOME?

08:31.811 --> 08:33.246
I'D LIKE THAT, BUT I'M AFRAID

08:33.312 --> 08:35.882
IF I'M TOO ENTHUSIASTIC,
YOU WON'T LET ME.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.017
IT'S FINE. IN FACT,
IT WOULD HELP US.

08:38.084 --> 08:39.919
THEN... YES!

08:39.986 --> 08:41.520
WHOO-HOO!

08:45.324 --> 08:47.627
OH, SO GOOD TO BE HOME.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.796
WELCOME TO THE PLEASUREDOME.

08:50.863 --> 08:54.800
LEAVE YOUR "CAN'Ts" AND
YOUR "DON'Ts" OUTSIDE.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.036
WE HAVE ONLY ONE RULE HERE.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.607
GREAT. WHAT A COOL PLACE.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.610
SO, I GUESS YOU'RE
REALLY INTO DOORS.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.679
BEHIND EACH ONE
IS A WISH FULFILLED.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.147
GO AHEAD. TAKE A LOOK.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.181
WHAT'S IN THERE?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.182
YOU'LL SEE.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.551
(<i> "Funky Song" playing</i> )

09:15.354 --> 09:18.024
IS THIS WHAT
I THINK IT IS?

09:18.090 --> 09:21.327
YES. YOU'RE BACKSTAGE
AT A BROTHERS CHUNK CONCERT.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.895
PHAT!

09:22.962 --> 09:23.963
WAIT.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.965
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET.

09:26.032 --> 09:26.966
OPEN THIS ONE.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.001
IT'S ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVES.

09:29.068 --> 09:29.669
WHAT IS IT?

09:29.735 --> 09:30.703
THE HALL

09:30.770 --> 09:32.838
OF GRATUITOUS PRAISE.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.073
(<i> crowd gasps</i> )

09:34.140 --> 09:35.641
YOU'RE FABULOUS!

09:35.708 --> 09:36.642
WE LOVE YOU!

09:36.709 --> 09:37.810
YOU'RE GORGEOUS!

09:37.877 --> 09:39.245
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

09:39.312 --> 09:40.680
YES, YOU ARE!

09:40.746 --> 09:42.581
OH, THAT WAS FUN.

09:42.648 --> 09:45.318
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

09:45.384 --> 09:46.852
WE ALSO HAVE...

09:46.919 --> 09:48.120
A 24-HOUR MALL

09:48.187 --> 09:50.189
AND A RESTAURANT FILLED

09:50.256 --> 09:53.659
WITH OOEY-GOOEY
<i>SLIMMING</i> DESSERTS.

09:53.726 --> 09:58.030
AND THAT'S A ROOM FILLED
WITH GORGEOUS SINGLE MEN.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.032
MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE A PEEK.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.000
NO, DON'T.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.069
DARLING, THEY KNOW
YOU'RE HERE

10:03.135 --> 10:05.705
AND THE LONGER
YOU KEEP THEM WAITING

10:05.771 --> 10:07.273
THE MORE THEY'LL WANT YOU.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.075
OH, SO THAT'S
HOW IT WORKS?

10:09.141 --> 10:10.343
UH-HUH.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.012
SO, WE'LL SAVE THAT ROOM
TILL LATER.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.348
BUT I'M ONLY HERE
FOR THE WEEKEND.

10:15.414 --> 10:18.017
WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.353
BONBONS?

10:23.756 --> 10:24.957
OH, IS THIS ROOM 107?

10:25.024 --> 10:25.624
YES.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.826
THAT'S STRANGE.

10:26.892 --> 10:30.029
SEE, THERE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A LECTURE HERE.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.263
BE KIND OF CROWDED.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.365
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING

10:32.431 --> 10:34.734
ABOUT A SUPER COLLIDER
CONFERENCE?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.069
NO, BUT I'M ALWAYS
THE LAST TO KNOW.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.007
WELL... THE INVITATION
SAYS 107 AND IT'S ENGRAVED.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.641
NICE. WHO'S IT FROM?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.276
THE VISUAL ENGINEERS

10:44.343 --> 10:46.912
FOR THE STUDY
OF THEORETICAL ACTIVITY.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.282
WHY DON'T THEY JUST
SHORTEN IT TO... VESTA?

10:50.349 --> 10:51.817
VESTA.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.920
(<i> cars zooming loudly</i> )

10:54.987 --> 10:56.255
HILDA!

10:56.322 --> 10:57.256
HILDA!

10:57.323 --> 10:59.692
ZELDA, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

10:59.759 --> 11:01.027
VESTA SET ME UP

11:01.093 --> 11:03.429
AND SHE SET YOU UP TOO.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.665
I WONDERED WHY THEY BOOKED
A STRING TRIO AT DAYTONA.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.401
(<i> screeching tires</i> )

11:10.469 --> 11:13.239
WELL, THERE'S YOUR BIG FINISH.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.774
COME ON, LET'S GO.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.841
ALL RIGHT

11:15.908 --> 11:18.044
BUT VESTA'S TRICK BACKFIRED.

11:18.110 --> 11:21.247
OUR TRIO JUST GOT BOOKED
AT THE INDY 500.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.782

11:22.848 --> 11:23.749
<i>JUDE THE OBSCURE.</i>

11:28.421 --> 11:29.321
I CAN'T.

WE NEED TO TALK.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.364
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

11:38.431 --> 11:40.199
NO, IT'S JUST
YOUR PRIORITIES.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.301
ISN'T THIS OBSESSION
WITH HOMEWORK

11:42.368 --> 11:44.236
GETTING IN THE WAY
OF YOUR FUN?

11:44.303 --> 11:45.438
WELL, I HAVE TO STUDY.

11:45.504 --> 11:46.739
WHY?

11:46.806 --> 11:48.808
YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN ALL THE TIME.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.742
WHY NOT?

11:49.809 --> 11:53.479
THINK ABOUT THAT
WHILE WE JOIN A CONGA LINE.
