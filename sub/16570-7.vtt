00:01.051 --> 00:04.680
<i>All units, citizen
reports shots fired at 1400 block of Vesper.</i>

00:04.854 --> 00:07.152
<i>Possible location of 6837.</i>

00:07.323 --> 00:10.349
Air 13, we'll be en route to that call.
We got about 30 seconds.

00:11.161 --> 00:14.995
<i>- Copy that, Air 13.
- 319 en route.</i>

00:15.165 --> 00:16.792
<i>274 responding.</i>

00:21.137 --> 00:23.537
Air 13, I'm over Friar and Vesper.

00:23.707 --> 00:26.335
I got a black and white.
Code six in the area.

00:26.509 --> 00:29.000
<i>10-4, Air 13. Please advise.</i>

00:29.713 --> 00:31.180
I think I got someone down here.

00:31.347 --> 00:35.784
Uh, Control, send me an ambulance to my
location right here. Friar and Vesper.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.147
<i>Copy, Air 13.
Do you have a fix on our officers?</i>

00:38.321 --> 00:39.720
<i>They're not responding.</i>

00:39.889 --> 00:42.517
Guys, Friar and Vesper,
if you can come up for Air 13?

00:43.193 --> 00:45.787
<i>Hey, Shop 542, come in, uh, for Air 13?</i>

00:45.962 --> 00:47.623
<i>You up, partner?</i>

00:48.565 --> 00:52.558
Officers at Friar and Vesper,
come up for Air 13.

00:55.405 --> 00:57.839
Partner, bring me around real quick.

01:00.877 --> 01:02.708
Yeah, I think I got some officers here.

01:02.879 --> 01:05.939
Control, be advised,
I have officers down at the location.

01:06.116 --> 01:08.243
Friar and Vesper, officers need help.

01:08.418 --> 01:11.114
Give me two paramedics to my location.
Friar and Vesper.

01:11.287 --> 01:13.755
Officers down.
I say again, officers down.

01:13.923 --> 01:15.720
<i>Copy, Air 13. Officers down.</i>

01:15.892 --> 01:20.386
Shop 319, I got you there.
It looks like Shop 274 behind him...

01:20.563 --> 01:24.522
...right turning in front of you.
There you go. Use caution in the area.

01:25.435 --> 01:29.132
Control, give me two paramedics
to my location right here. Friar and Vesper.

01:29.305 --> 01:32.001
<i>10-4, Air 13. Paramedics rolling.</i>

01:32.175 --> 01:34.200
I'm gonna need
three more units to my location.

01:34.377 --> 01:36.311
We need everybody on this one.

01:36.479 --> 01:39.380
The east building tops
and the north building tops are clear.

01:39.549 --> 01:41.710
I got no suspect activity
on these rooftops.

01:41.885 --> 01:44.376
<i>What's the ETA on my units?
I need paramedics now?</i>

02:43.179 --> 02:44.840
Detective.

02:49.485 --> 02:50.509
Okay, Buzz...

02:51.020 --> 02:54.956
...oh, make sure to get the body
over here, please. Thank you.

02:57.994 --> 02:59.655
Okay.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.154
So, what happened here?

03:01.331 --> 03:04.425
Based on where the black and white
got fired on...

03:04.601 --> 03:07.297
...looks like our guys followed a car
around this corner...

03:07.470 --> 03:09.734
...probably making a traffic stop.

03:09.906 --> 03:11.897
Got ambushed
before they could even get out.

03:12.075 --> 03:14.669
They didn't even have time
to put the car in park.

03:15.378 --> 03:18.211
The officers were shortstopped.

03:18.381 --> 03:19.405
Lieutenant Tao?

03:19.582 --> 03:22.779
That would put the suspect's car
about...

03:23.386 --> 03:25.183
About here.

03:25.889 --> 03:27.220
Okay...

03:27.390 --> 03:32.521
...so they turn the corner,
jump out of the car...

03:32.695 --> 03:35.528
...fire on the black and white
as it drives up. Why?

03:35.698 --> 03:37.165
I don't know.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.200
But our guys got lit up
by some pretty heavy firepower.

03:40.370 --> 03:43.533
I mean, look at the casings.
Assault rifles.

03:43.706 --> 03:48.075
Looks like the kid was standing here,
firing the 25 auto.

03:48.244 --> 03:50.041
So he wasn't the driver.

03:50.213 --> 03:52.374
Or maybe he wasn't in the car at all.

03:52.548 --> 03:56.348
Sergeant Brown, I think that piece
of plastic is from a car taillight.

03:56.519 --> 03:59.920
We'll get the make and model
as soon as SID is through with it.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.057
- Deputy Chief Johnson.
- Captain Raydor.

04:03.226 --> 04:06.320
One moment, please.
Sergeant Elliot, get a picture of this.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.262
It would appear that the, uh, officer
had to fire back through the windshield.

04:10.433 --> 04:13.266
Yeah, that officer had a name, captain.
It's Mike Stern.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.770
I rode with his father.

04:15.939 --> 04:21.343
Yeah. And Mike's partner, Enrique Duran,
he bled to death on the street.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.773
It's upsetting...

04:23.346 --> 04:26.076
...but we all have to be very careful
with our emotions...

04:26.249 --> 04:28.046
...over the next couple of days.

04:28.284 --> 04:31.879
Uh, Captain Raydor,
um, pardon me for bringing this up...

04:32.055 --> 04:35.752
...but isn't it a little early for
Force Investigations to be on the scene?

04:35.925 --> 04:39.053
Officers murdered in the street
belong to Major Crimes.

04:39.395 --> 04:41.955
And civilians killed by L.A.P.D.
belong to me.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.590
Everything about this says gangs.

04:45.134 --> 04:47.796
Everything except the dead white boy
over there...

04:47.971 --> 04:50.804
...who I have to treat as a victim
until proven otherwise.

04:50.974 --> 04:54.375
It's obvious that your victim
was shooting at our police officers...

04:54.544 --> 04:56.978
...who despite being
immensely outgunned...

04:57.146 --> 04:59.205
...only fired back in self-defense.

04:59.382 --> 05:03.079
And you can prove that
right now as we stand here?

05:03.252 --> 05:05.982
That gun belonged to that boy
and he fired it?

05:06.155 --> 05:09.181
Because if you can't, what I see...

05:09.359 --> 05:12.226
...is a traffic stop that ended
in a massive shootout...

05:12.395 --> 05:14.226
...and I've gotta ask why.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.059
It's my job to answer that question,
captain.

05:17.533 --> 05:19.558
It's my job as well.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.763
Because these officers, while defending
themselves, discharged their weapons...

05:24.340 --> 05:25.830
...and a civilian died.

05:26.009 --> 05:28.739
If you'll just step into my command post...

05:28.911 --> 05:31.641
No, I'm not...
I'm not going anywhere with you.

05:31.814 --> 05:34.146
I can't stop FID from interfering...

05:34.317 --> 05:37.286
...but if you wanna be involved,
you're gonna have to follow me.

05:41.190 --> 05:45.183
Okay. So this, uh, dead kid here.
Does he have a name?

05:45.361 --> 05:48.455
Kevin Webber.
His driver's license says he's 18 years old...

05:48.631 --> 05:51.623
...has a Simi Valley address
and a juvenile arrest for vandalism.

05:51.801 --> 05:55.328
I want the search warrant for his home
ready when we notify the family.

05:55.505 --> 05:57.803
Chief, so far no eye-witnesses
to the gun fight...

05:57.974 --> 06:00.602
...but lots of people saw two guys
in a dark brown car...

06:00.777 --> 06:02.608
...no make or model, taking off east.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.770
- Anyone get a license-plate number?
- No.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.211
I released the tip-line number
to the press.

06:07.383 --> 06:10.181
We're getting crazies calling in,
but we may get some leads.

06:10.353 --> 06:11.547
Thank you.

06:11.721 --> 06:14.246
You'll have every cop
pulling over every dark car...

06:14.424 --> 06:17.222
That's why I'm not handing
that information over to anyone...

06:17.393 --> 06:20.988
...including our own officers.
I'm not here to inspire a lynch mob.

06:21.164 --> 06:24.691
When I need your assistance,
I'll ask for it, captain. Thank you.

06:24.867 --> 06:28.735
Uh, Lieutenant Tao, why don't you field
the calls from the tip line, please?

06:28.905 --> 06:31.032
Lieutenant Flynn,
why don't you stay on SID?

06:31.207 --> 06:35.041
Make sure they follow up on that
taillight and ballistics, please.

06:35.211 --> 06:39.341
Sergeant Gabriel, I wanna know soon as
that search warrant comes in. Thank you.

06:39.515 --> 06:41.540
And I have a 72-hour deadline...

06:41.717 --> 06:45.517
...so the sooner I head off charges
against these officers for improper use of...

06:45.688 --> 06:48.316
You wanna question these officers
about excessive force?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.049
Really? Go to the morgue.

06:50.226 --> 06:52.126
With all due respect, sir...

06:52.295 --> 06:55.753
...when civilians are killed
by L.A.P.D. officers, lawsuits follow.

06:55.932 --> 07:00.164
Nothing protects our department more
completely than finding out the truth.

07:01.104 --> 07:03.766
You want truth?
Yeah, I have a couple of truths.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.431
I have to leave now
and tell the chief and mayor...

07:06.609 --> 07:09.271
...how we intend to catch the people
who murdered our own.

07:09.445 --> 07:12.608
Also, I have to explain to the families
of our fallen officers...

07:12.782 --> 07:16.411
...why their husbands and fathers
are not coming home tonight.

07:16.586 --> 07:21.023
And afterwards, I have to prove
that they died with honor.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.956
Or would you prefer their reputations
smeared in a civil suit...

07:25.128 --> 07:27.358
...alleging that they acted in bad faith?

07:32.668 --> 07:36.866
All right. FID shares the scene,
but it belongs to Major Crimes.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.600
You may work alongside Chief Johnson,
but you may not impede her...

07:40.776 --> 07:42.937
...while solving the case. Is that clear?

07:43.112 --> 07:44.511
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.910
I have a search warrant
for Webber's apartment.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.243
Thank you. Let's go.

07:48.417 --> 07:49.850
- I'm going with you.
- Why?

07:50.019 --> 07:52.510
Because at the moment,
Kevin Webber is my victim...

07:52.688 --> 07:54.417
...and I have to do the notification.

07:54.590 --> 07:57.150
Hope you have your own car.

08:02.198 --> 08:04.666
Can you all just watch
where you're walking? Ugh.

08:05.935 --> 08:08.233
And please put everything back
where you found it.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.872
You hear me, boy?

08:11.307 --> 08:15.835
Uh, we'll be extra careful. We were, uh,
talking about, uh, your son, Kevin.

08:16.012 --> 08:19.038
I don't have to answer for my son.
Kevin is 18. He's an adult.

08:19.215 --> 08:20.443
Uh, I understand.

08:20.616 --> 08:23.779
- Do you know any of Kevin's friends?
- Kevin doesn't have any.

08:23.953 --> 08:25.147
What car does Kevin drive?

08:25.321 --> 08:27.789
He doesn't and he knows
not to come near my pickup.

08:27.957 --> 08:31.256
Excuse me, you know what?
Kevin is not here. Okay?

08:31.427 --> 08:33.895
So if you'd like,
I can tell him you all came by.

08:34.063 --> 08:35.087
Is there a message?

08:35.264 --> 08:37.289
You want a message?
I got a message for you.

08:37.466 --> 08:39.764
- Yes.
- Careful, lieutenant. Mrs. Webber.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.029
- We've, uh, something to tell you.
- Just a minute.

08:42.205 --> 08:43.797
- Earlier tonight...
- No.

08:43.972 --> 08:47.170
I'm sorry to say there was a shooting
and your son Kevin was killed.

08:49.011 --> 08:53.778
Oh, no. No, no, no.
He just left here a few hours ago.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.214
- Ma'am, who did he leave with?
- I don't know.

08:56.385 --> 08:57.443
But my son is not dead.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.851
You do not come into my house
and tell me that my boy is dead.

09:01.023 --> 09:03.719
Get your hands off!
I do not wanna be touched by Mexicans.

09:03.893 --> 09:05.258
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna...

09:05.428 --> 09:07.362
- Sit down on the couch!
- I don't wanna...

09:07.530 --> 09:09.157
- Sit!
- Chief?

09:17.340 --> 09:18.864
Oh, that's adorable, ugh.

09:23.079 --> 09:25.377
Looks like Kevin might have been
in a gang.

09:25.548 --> 09:28.984
Regardless, his head wasn't shaved
and I didn't see any tattoos.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.483
How do we know what he was up to?

09:31.654 --> 09:35.317
I might've been able to find that out
if you hadn't shortstopped my interview.

09:35.491 --> 09:39.894
I got a number for Adrien's
Tattoo and Piercing and this.

09:40.062 --> 09:41.290
In Nazi-land, chief...

09:41.464 --> 09:45.457
...you don't usually get the lightning bolts
until you've killed someone.

09:46.702 --> 09:49.933
I wanna meet this tattoo artist.
Drag him out of bed if you have to.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.006
Yes, ma'am.

09:53.442 --> 09:56.343
Is this enough proof for you
that Kevin wasn't just a victim?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.975
No.

10:02.051 --> 10:03.643
Bitch.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.653
How many were there?

10:12.828 --> 10:15.695
Oh, no. Just slow down, miss.
Take your time.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.833
Did you get a look at the faces,
ma'am?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.831
L.A.P.D. tip line,
who am I speaking to?

10:20.002 --> 10:21.594
Do not engage them directly, sir.

10:21.771 --> 10:23.796
- What's the make and model?
- All right...

10:23.973 --> 10:26.134
...come on, move along,
will you please? Guys.

10:26.309 --> 10:28.675
Come on. If you're not part of
the investigation...

10:28.844 --> 10:30.505
...you're just slowing us down. Hey!

10:30.680 --> 10:35.242
- Gabriel, any word on that taillight?
- No. No, no, not you. You keep going.

10:35.418 --> 10:39.548
Yeah, yeah. I'm here. Still trying
to track down the Ballistics reports.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.282
FID? What the hell are they doing there?

10:42.458 --> 10:45.586
If the guys in the car with Kevin Webber
had tattoos like this...

10:45.761 --> 10:47.422
...they're not running to Mexico.

10:47.596 --> 10:49.393
White power isn't big down there.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.534
Yeah, can the FBI help us track
all the different Aryan gangs?

10:52.702 --> 10:55.865
Tell you what, let me make some calls,
see what wiretaps are up.

10:56.038 --> 10:58.233
You never know.
Maybe there's been some chatter.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.398
Okay, thanks.

11:01.177 --> 11:04.078
You're telling me you took our ballistics
from the crime scene?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.305
Lieutenant, we're studying them,
we'll give...

11:06.482 --> 11:08.382
Captain, that belongs to us.

11:08.551 --> 11:10.712
You tell me how
we're supposed to do our jobs.

11:10.886 --> 11:13.286
Ugh, Lieutenant Flynn,
what seems to be the trouble here?

11:13.456 --> 11:16.687
When you were serving the search warrant,
FID came in and swooped...

11:16.859 --> 11:18.986
...and took everything
from the crime scene.

11:19.161 --> 11:21.652
The casings, the broken taillight,
every damn thing!

11:22.665 --> 11:24.895
We're studying them
and we will give them back.

11:25.067 --> 11:28.366
Not only were we gonna give it back,
we will have answers for you.

11:28.537 --> 11:30.129
Where are you going?

11:36.612 --> 11:39.137
Which part of
"the scene belongs to Major Crimes"...

11:39.315 --> 11:40.680
...did you not understand?

11:40.850 --> 11:43.910
Until we can prove that the dead
civilian lying on the ground...

11:44.086 --> 11:47.647
...was firing at the police, I need to...
- Chief Johnson, you were saying?

11:47.823 --> 11:51.350
We can place Kevin at the crime scene
with a gun two feet from his body.

11:51.527 --> 11:53.893
And the tattoos that we found
at his apartment...

11:54.063 --> 11:57.760
...link him to Aryan gangs
known for attacks on police officers.

11:57.933 --> 12:00.026
- Tattoos or drawings?
- Drawings of tattoos.

12:00.202 --> 12:01.931
The coroner's already confirmed...

12:02.104 --> 12:04.538
- You've spoken to the coroner?
- Of course I have.

12:04.707 --> 12:07.267
Ridiculous.
Everything indicates that he was involved.

12:07.443 --> 12:11.277
Kevin Webber's prints are not on the gun
that was found near the body...

12:11.447 --> 12:13.574
GSR's a complete waste of time if you...

12:13.749 --> 12:17.446
If Kevin Webber's mother sues L.A.P.D.
for shooting her son to death...

12:17.620 --> 12:20.714
...the jury will want me
to do more than indicate.

12:20.890 --> 12:23.825
Without these things
that you deem unimportant...

12:23.993 --> 12:27.588
...who's to say right now, definitively,
that he was one of the attackers?

12:27.763 --> 12:32.359
- I could, if you'd release my evidence.
- Which you will do now, Captain Raydor.

12:32.535 --> 12:36.369
I want you to personally
take Kevin Webber's cell phone...

12:36.539 --> 12:38.871
...the casings from the scene...
- Chief...

12:39.041 --> 12:41.805
...I just want to get them
inputted into the NIBIN.

12:41.977 --> 12:43.706
Our equipment is more sophisticated...

12:43.879 --> 12:46.109
And the broken taillight...

12:46.282 --> 12:48.546
...and whatever else
Chief Johnson needs...

12:48.717 --> 12:51.208
...and hand-carry them down
to Major Crimes.

12:51.954 --> 12:53.546
Like, now.

12:53.722 --> 12:56.247
And if the inspector general
has a problem with that...

12:56.425 --> 12:58.950
...I'll be happy to have
that conversation.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.759
Yes, sir.

13:03.933 --> 13:05.730
- Dismissed.
- Thank you.

13:17.480 --> 13:23.282
Thank you.
Okay, here's your evidence.

13:26.255 --> 13:28.348
- Is that everything?
- Oh, gosh, I hope so.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.287
Oh, by the way, the lens
from the taillight we found...

13:34.463 --> 13:39.594
...was placed on every Olds Cutlass
between 1985 and 1990 if that helps.

13:42.505 --> 13:46.032
Is that the tattoo artist whose card
we found at Kevin Webber's house?

13:46.208 --> 13:47.232
It is.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.344
I have a list of questions
I need to ask this guy.

13:50.513 --> 13:54.210
If you don't hear everything you need
from Chief Johnson's interview...

13:54.383 --> 13:55.748
...you can go next.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.545
I usually go first.

13:58.153 --> 14:00.883
- Then this should be a change for you.
- Heh.

14:01.223 --> 14:03.521
Adrien Beck.

14:04.126 --> 14:05.388
I'm Deputy Chief Johnson.

14:05.561 --> 14:08.496
I understand Sergeant Gabriel
informed you of your rights.

14:08.664 --> 14:12.327
He didn't tell me why you guys dragged me
here in the middle of the night.

14:12.501 --> 14:13.866
I've been admiring your work.

14:14.036 --> 14:16.436
Well, if you're interested,
come by my studio.

14:16.605 --> 14:21.201
In the morning.
I'll give you the, uh, L.A.P.D. special.

14:21.377 --> 14:24.369
- What can you tell me about this man?
- Nothing. I don't know him.

14:24.547 --> 14:27.072
We found your business card
in his apartment.

14:27.249 --> 14:28.716
I have lots of clients, man.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.847
I understand
that you did some time in prison.

14:34.023 --> 14:36.389
Is this where you learned
how to make Nazi tattoos?

14:36.559 --> 14:39.153
Everybody has reasons
for the ink they want.

14:39.328 --> 14:42.491
I'm a practicing Buddhist.
I don't judge.

14:43.332 --> 14:44.492
I do Aryans.

14:44.667 --> 14:49.104
I also do Mexican gangbangers.
It's, uh, all freedom of speech, man.

14:49.271 --> 14:53.401
You're on parole and your freedom does
not include associating with known felons.

14:53.576 --> 14:57.171
Wouldn't take me more than 20 minutes
to have you finish your sentence.

14:57.346 --> 15:00.611
Look, I don't ask my clients
for their criminal record.

15:00.783 --> 15:02.580
I don't know that kid.

15:02.751 --> 15:05.948
I don't remember those drawings,
thank you and good night.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.855
Well, you've been very helpful.
Wouldn't you say so, Sergeant Gabriel?

15:10.025 --> 15:11.424
Yes, extremely helpful.

15:11.594 --> 15:14.085
I should release your name to the media...

15:14.263 --> 15:17.130
...as a local hero standing up
to the Aryan community.

15:17.566 --> 15:22.367
Imagine what an inspiration you'll be
to people terrified of neo-Nazi maniacs.

15:22.538 --> 15:27.441
- Whoa! You gonna put me on TV?
- Or you can sit back down, Adrien.

15:31.580 --> 15:32.911
Sit down.

15:36.118 --> 15:39.417
Take some deep breaths.
Remember your new mantra:

15:39.588 --> 15:41.886
"I help the police, I help the police."

15:42.057 --> 15:44.321
Okay, okay, okay.
Nobody do anything crazy here.

15:44.493 --> 15:48.122
- You saying you wanna talk to us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.164 --> 15:50.927
Now do you remember that kid?

15:52.401 --> 15:55.370
He came in my shop about a week ago.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.665
I did some drawings for him and he left.
And that is all I know.

15:58.841 --> 16:00.331
- Who was he with?
- Come on, man.

16:00.509 --> 16:03.000
- I need names.
- Look, these are bad dudes.

16:03.178 --> 16:05.578
I hear they're huge
in the crystal-meth business.

16:05.748 --> 16:08.012
Don't make me talk about these guys.

16:08.183 --> 16:10.845
You're afraid of the Aryans knowing
that you spoke to us?

16:11.020 --> 16:13.352
Imagine how you'd feel
when I send you to lockup...

16:13.522 --> 16:15.456
...and word slips out
that you're a police snitch.

16:15.624 --> 16:16.818
Oh, no, no.

16:18.193 --> 16:21.856
Why did she do that? She threatened
to have him killed in front of me.

16:22.031 --> 16:23.896
He works with Nazis.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.261
You need something
to wipe your tears away?

16:28.137 --> 16:32.437
One guy was kind of short.
They called him, uh, Stomper or Trooper.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.132
The taller guy, he was the shot-caller.

16:34.309 --> 16:36.709
He didn't tell me his name
and, heh, I didn't ask.

16:36.879 --> 16:39.177
- Where can I find them?
- I don't know.

16:39.348 --> 16:41.213
I don't know where they live.

16:41.383 --> 16:44.352
- Where do I find them?
- Uh, they're on Page 29 and 30 of my book.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.194
That's one more connection
between Webber...

17:01.370 --> 17:03.304
...and the men who killed our officers.

17:03.472 --> 17:06.134
You are finding a lot of tattoos.

17:08.711 --> 17:10.974
I'm more interested in the people
wearing them.

17:26.662 --> 17:28.323
Chief. Chief?

17:32.534 --> 17:34.365
Pardon me.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.628
Excuse me. Pardon me. Thank you.

17:37.806 --> 17:41.264
We're, uh, going through the evidence
we got from Nurse Ratched.

17:41.443 --> 17:43.673
Sanchez is running down
the phone numbers...

17:43.846 --> 17:45.507
...and Ballistics has the shells.

17:45.681 --> 17:49.242
We're looking through all registered
Olds Cutlasses from 1985 on.

17:49.418 --> 17:51.943
So far it's another
needle-in-a-haystack situation.

17:52.121 --> 17:54.180
At least we know
which haystack to look in.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.490
- Morning.
- Morning.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.889
Chief wants me to make a statement.
Anything you'd like me to release?

18:00.062 --> 18:03.259
Well, nothing about the case.
But I want the officers' biographies...

18:03.432 --> 18:06.094
...to make it to the front page of the paper,
if possible.

18:06.268 --> 18:08.862
Officer Stern twice been awarded
the medal of valor...

18:09.037 --> 18:11.938
...and Officer Duran has two children
and a baby on the way.

18:12.107 --> 18:13.574
I want people to know that.

18:13.742 --> 18:16.540
Damn. You got it. Anything else?

18:16.712 --> 18:20.580
Can you, uh, get Captain Raydor
to stop following me?

18:20.749 --> 18:24.276
I wish I could give you a room to yourself,
but Raydor has a case too.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.016
Oh, that's a good idea.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.182
- It is?
- Yes. Yes. Thank you.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.385
Yeah. Sure. Any time.

18:33.562 --> 18:35.530
All right, everybody. Uh, listen up.

18:35.697 --> 18:41.431
We have, uh, possible a.k.a.'s for
one of our shooters. Stomper or Trooper.

18:41.603 --> 18:44.401
Please run those names
through your moniker databases...

18:44.573 --> 18:47.872
...and check them against
the L.A.P.D. Gang Support Section files.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.409
Uh, Narcotics, please check
with all your informants...

18:50.579 --> 18:53.446
...see if there's been any conversation
in the meth community.

18:53.615 --> 18:55.242
Uh, for those who don't have a copy...

18:55.417 --> 18:58.215
...Sergeant Gabriel will be handing out
copies of tattoos...

18:58.387 --> 19:00.981
...that we hope will help
identify our suspects.

19:01.156 --> 19:03.249
All right, tattoos.
Spiderweb on the elbow.

19:03.425 --> 19:05.689
You guys probably know
that means time served.

19:05.861 --> 19:07.351
You take one and pass it around.

19:07.529 --> 19:09.793
- The next...
- Uh, these men are likely two strikers.

19:09.965 --> 19:13.594
Just the weapons they were carrying
would guarantee them life in prison.

19:13.769 --> 19:18.297
Which would explain why they shot
at our police officers at a traffic stop.

19:18.473 --> 19:19.838
Second tattoo.

19:20.008 --> 19:23.102
Aryan fish shows membership
in the neo-Nazi or outlaw biker gangs.

19:23.278 --> 19:26.873
Sheriff's Department, would you please
run this tattoo through your jail?

19:27.049 --> 19:30.280
- Take one, pass it along.
- Uh, Parole, make sure everyone has a copy.

19:30.452 --> 19:36.220
In the meantime, I want every suspected
neo-Nazi and skinhead rounded up.

19:36.391 --> 19:40.020
Hit every house, apartment
and trailer park that you can find.

19:40.195 --> 19:44.928
"Kill cops and you will not live to regret it."

19:50.305 --> 19:53.536
Okay, in the meantime, uh,
Captain Raydor over here also has a case.

19:53.709 --> 19:57.110
I'm sure that she could use your help.
Captain Raydor.

20:03.919 --> 20:05.614
Excuse me.

20:07.089 --> 20:09.956
- Can I have your attention?
- No one is allowed in my office.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.059
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

20:12.227 --> 20:14.422
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

20:14.596 --> 20:16.996
Can I have your attention, please?

20:19.268 --> 20:23.728
Hey, people, let's hold down the noise!

20:25.207 --> 20:27.175
Excuse me.
Captain Raydor, you were saying?

20:27.342 --> 20:28.639
Thank you, lieutenant.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.675
<i>Do you have a fix on our officers?</i>

20:30.846 --> 20:31.870
<i>They're not responding.</i>

20:32.047 --> 20:35.244
<i>Hey, guys, Friar
and Vesper, if you can come up for Air 13?</i>

20:35.417 --> 20:38.045
<i>Hey, Shop 542, come in, uh, for Air 13?</i>

20:38.220 --> 20:39.585
<i>You up, partner?</i>

20:39.755 --> 20:44.419
<i>Officers at Friar and Vesper,
come up for Air 13.</i>

20:44.593 --> 20:46.891
<i>Yeah, I think I got some officers here.</i>

20:47.062 --> 20:50.225
<i>Control, be advised,
I have officers down at the location.</i>

20:50.399 --> 20:52.128
<i>Friar and Vesper, officers need help.</i>

20:52.301 --> 20:55.532
<i>Give me two paramedics at my location,
Friar and Vesper.</i>

20:55.704 --> 20:58.195
<i>Officers down. I say again, officers down.</i>

20:58.373 --> 21:01.342
<i>Copy, Air 13. Officers down...</i>

21:12.754 --> 21:15.052
- She said no one can come in.
- I don't care.

21:15.223 --> 21:17.384
Don't shoot. I'm alone.

21:17.559 --> 21:20.323
What is it, lieutenant?
Has the National Guard arrived?

21:20.495 --> 21:23.293
Well, Captain Raydor is occupied.

21:23.465 --> 21:28.334
Heh, she'll be talking for days.
So, what can I help you with?

21:28.904 --> 21:31.031
I don't know.
I can't think straight right now.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.833
Because of all these people around.

21:33.008 --> 21:36.136
I guarantee you, in a couple of days
we will have made our arrest...

21:36.311 --> 21:39.439
...and they'll all be gone.
And it'll just be the six of us again.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.747
Hate to interrupt, but we've had
over 250 calls to the tip line...

21:44.920 --> 21:47.047
...all claiming to have an answer
of some kind.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.884
Then just five minutes ago
a woman called with a question.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.787
What did she wanna know?

21:51.960 --> 21:54.827
She wanted to know if the shooters
were driving an Oldsmobile.

21:54.997 --> 21:57.989
Claims her nephew lent hers out
and it came back damaged.

21:58.166 --> 22:00.726
Flynn's running down
the name and address.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.093
Oh!

22:02.270 --> 22:05.262
Oh, sorry, chief.
Buzz said I couldn't come in the other way.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.930
What is it?

22:07.109 --> 22:10.078
Well, Tao's caller turns out to be
Eleanor Kretchner, aged 69.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.974
And guess what kind of car she owns?

22:12.147 --> 22:15.981
A 1987 Olds Cutlass, copper color
and it gets better.

22:16.151 --> 22:19.746
The nephew who said
that he supposedly lent out the car...

22:19.921 --> 22:23.880
...he just got out of prison a year ago.
Check out the mug shot.

22:25.794 --> 22:27.625
Edward "Teddy" Kretchner.

22:29.197 --> 22:30.221
Oh!

22:30.399 --> 22:34.130
Hey, chief. Bringing you an aerial map
of the caller's residence...

22:34.302 --> 22:36.133
...courtesy of Lieutenant Tao's phone.

22:36.304 --> 22:39.637
- You believe that?
- E-mail it to the chief's computer.

22:39.808 --> 22:41.503
- E-mail it?
- Yeah. I'll do it.

22:45.047 --> 22:46.241
- Chief?
- Yes?

22:46.415 --> 22:49.213
The number of Tao's caller
shows up on Webber's cell phone...

22:49.384 --> 22:51.477
...six times in the past week.
- Okay. Sent.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.314
Okay. No, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't. I can do it.

22:56.491 --> 22:58.356
- All right.
- Okay.

22:58.560 --> 22:59.584
Okay.

23:02.330 --> 23:04.389
- There you go.
- Press.

23:04.566 --> 23:07.160
Press. Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Would you look at that?

23:07.335 --> 23:09.599
Looks like there's a garage
around the back.

23:10.072 --> 23:13.633
Okay, let's pay a visit
to Ms. Kretchner's house.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.438
Take a look at that car.
Uh, Lieutenant Flynn, I want that taillight.

23:17.612 --> 23:20.604
And, uh, Detective Sanchez,
please call Detective Mikki Mendoza.

23:20.782 --> 23:24.479
Have SIS set up a surveillance
on the house. Thank you.

23:31.059 --> 23:33.926
Detective Mendoza,
congratulations on the new baby.

23:34.096 --> 23:36.963
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Any sign of Mr. Kretchner?

23:37.132 --> 23:40.363
No, ma'am, as far as we can tell
his Aunt Eleanor is home alone.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.203
- We are in position just in case.
- Thank you, detective.

23:45.073 --> 23:46.472
Oh, that woman.

23:47.776 --> 23:50.836
Uh, it's okay, detective.
She's one of us. Sort of.

23:51.012 --> 23:55.210
Chief Johnson. I see I'm once again
behind in this investigation.

23:55.383 --> 23:59.683
I told you. I can't slow down.
Anyway, you're here.

24:02.757 --> 24:05.248
Uh, Mrs. Kretchner?

24:05.427 --> 24:06.689
- Hello?
- Hello.

24:06.862 --> 24:10.389
I'm Detective Johnson,
this is Detectives Raydor and Sanchez.

24:10.565 --> 24:12.931
We're here from
the Los Angeles Police Department.

24:13.101 --> 24:17.197
Oh, my. I can't believe
you came all the way out here.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.170
The man on the phone
didn't seem all that interested.

24:20.342 --> 24:22.810
Uh, on the tip line
you mentioned your nephew.

24:22.978 --> 24:24.070
Yes, Ted.

24:24.246 --> 24:28.342
He gave my car to one of his friends
last night.

24:28.517 --> 24:30.781
I have macular degeneration.

24:30.952 --> 24:34.149
I don't see as well as I once did,
so I don't drive anymore.

24:34.322 --> 24:37.814
But when I went in the garage
for my watering can...

24:37.993 --> 24:40.427
Flowers can't stay fresh without water.

24:40.595 --> 24:45.589
Well, even I could see my poor old Cutlass
was missing a side mirror.

24:45.767 --> 24:48.099
- I'll show you the car.
- No, no, that's all right.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.135
We'll take a look.
You stay here. We won't be long.

24:50.305 --> 24:51.863
Ugh, excuse us.

24:58.113 --> 25:00.547
- Is everything okay?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

25:00.715 --> 25:03.445
Everything's fine.
It's not the car we're looking for.

25:03.618 --> 25:07.714
Oh, thank goodness.
I don't want to get Teddy in trouble.

25:07.889 --> 25:10.858
- Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am, I'm positive.

25:11.026 --> 25:12.960
Thank you so much for your help.

25:13.128 --> 25:14.618
They should've dumped this car.

25:14.796 --> 25:19.927
Yes, they should have, but they
didn't. So I have to ask myself, why?

25:21.236 --> 25:24.433
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait. Not gonna leave this vehicle here.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.071
Yes, I am.

25:27.242 --> 25:30.177
If Kevin Webber was in that car,
he left behind fingerprints...

25:30.345 --> 25:33.644
...that will definitively connect him
to the shooters and make my case.

25:33.815 --> 25:36.113
I can't be concerned
about your case, captain.

25:36.718 --> 25:38.777
Let's be clear.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.945
Under the best of circumstances...

25:41.122 --> 25:43.784
...leaving this car behind
is a lure for Ted Kretchner...

25:43.959 --> 25:46.120
...guarantees a confrontation
of some sort...

25:46.294 --> 25:50.663
...with police officers you've already
lathered up into an angry mob.

25:50.832 --> 25:53.198
- You thought about the consequences?
- Yes.

25:53.368 --> 25:58.431
If we end up having to shoot these killers,
the crime scene will be all yours, captain.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.942
Detective.

26:01.109 --> 26:02.667
Ma'am.

26:12.187 --> 26:16.453
What do you got in there?
Oh, he's got your eyes.

26:16.625 --> 26:19.116
And your personality.

26:38.079 --> 26:39.876
Look at that.

26:40.315 --> 26:41.805
Wetbacks with a baby.

26:43.985 --> 26:46.476
Probably got nine more at home.

26:48.623 --> 26:51.319
Whole town's going brown, man.

26:53.328 --> 26:57.264
- Police! Don't move. Stay where you are.
- Down to the ground with your hands up.

26:57.832 --> 26:58.856
Oh!

26:59.034 --> 27:02.265
Don't move. Take another step
and I'll blow your brains out.

27:02.437 --> 27:03.927
No, you won't.

27:11.413 --> 27:13.779
Come on. Come on, cop, huh?

27:31.333 --> 27:33.358
- Arms behind your back.
- Four on one!

27:33.535 --> 27:35.400
Arms behind your back.

27:35.704 --> 27:37.729
- Got you, you son of a bitch.
- All right.

27:41.976 --> 27:45.139
May I have your attention?
Everyone, listen up.

27:45.980 --> 27:47.504
- We got them.
- Nice.

27:47.682 --> 27:48.706
We got them!

27:57.058 --> 28:00.960
Gomez. Gonzales.

28:01.129 --> 28:04.121
G3. Gilbert Gomez Gonzales, ha-ha-ha.

28:04.299 --> 28:05.698
Meet Ted Kretchner.

28:05.867 --> 28:09.359
Got his first strike for armed robbery,
got his second one on a meth beef.

28:09.537 --> 28:11.300
Nice. Who's his friend?

28:11.473 --> 28:13.805
Jesse Langhopher, a.k.a. Stomper.

28:13.975 --> 28:17.843
He's a Nazi low rider.
He did a long stint in Folsom with Teddy.

28:18.012 --> 28:20.480
Well, as I see it,
we have a few issues here.

28:20.648 --> 28:23.879
We can't place these guys in the Oldsmobile
at the time of the murder.

28:24.052 --> 28:26.179
We have no weapons,
we have no witnesses.

28:26.354 --> 28:29.517
So obviously a confession
will be very important.

28:29.691 --> 28:33.422
But another issue has come up
which may be more serious.

28:33.595 --> 28:35.358
I don't mean to step on your case...

28:35.530 --> 28:38.192
...but Kretchner has twice asked
for medical attention...

28:38.366 --> 28:41.529
...which automatically triggers
a use-of-force investigation.

28:41.703 --> 28:42.829
- Now?
- Yeah.

28:43.004 --> 28:47.634
Really? Ugh, look, this kind of thing happens
all the time when people resist arrest.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.801
- If you hadn't been...
- I warned you about leaving the car.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.380
If you go into the room and follow the rules
from that book of yours...

28:54.549 --> 28:56.574
...I promise you,
these men will lawyer up.

28:56.751 --> 28:58.378
Please let me go first.

28:58.553 --> 29:02.216
I understand the complexity of the situation,
but I can't let you do that.

29:02.390 --> 29:06.019
What does the guy have, a black eye?
It hasn't even started swelling yet.

29:06.194 --> 29:09.891
Pretending not to see things
is how I came to be here in the first place.

29:10.064 --> 29:13.864
Does anybody really think
I wanna go in there? Anyone?

29:14.068 --> 29:16.195
Okay. All right, captain. Fine. Go ahead.

29:16.371 --> 29:19.067
Just... All I ask is that you hurry.
Please.

29:20.074 --> 29:23.134
Hey, you know what
you call 50 Mexicans lined up in a row?

29:23.311 --> 29:24.642
A "spicket" fence.

29:30.351 --> 29:32.046
- Do you need me to stay, ma'am?
- Oh!

29:32.220 --> 29:34.848
No, thank you, Detective Sanchez.
I'm fine.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.014
Sanchez.

29:40.261 --> 29:43.992
Mr. Kretchner, I'm Captain Raydor.
Is this a good time to talk?

29:44.165 --> 29:45.792
What, has he got a lunch date?

29:45.967 --> 29:48.299
- We're gonna be so screwed here.
- No, we're not.

29:48.470 --> 29:52.065
Gabriel, please prepare the search warrant
for Mrs. Kretchner's house.

29:57.946 --> 30:03.077
First, Mr. Kretchner, I need to inform you
that you have the right to remain silent.

30:03.251 --> 30:06.414
Which means
you can refuse to answer any question.

30:06.588 --> 30:09.284
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

30:09.457 --> 30:11.618
Do you understand?

30:12.794 --> 30:14.785
You have the right to have an attorney...

30:14.963 --> 30:17.727
...to consult an attorney
before talking to the police...

30:17.899 --> 30:20.697
...and to have an attorney present
during questioning.

30:20.869 --> 30:22.393
Do you understand?

30:22.570 --> 30:27.234
- My God. How we gonna get out of this?
- No, no, no, it's okay.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.137
They weren't gonna talk to me anyway.

30:29.310 --> 30:32.643
Her advising him of his rights,
this may actually work to our advantage.

30:32.814 --> 30:35.715
Knowing and understanding your rights
as I've explained them...

30:35.884 --> 30:40.787
...are you willing to answer a few questions
without an attorney present?

30:40.955 --> 30:42.752
Eat me.

30:44.893 --> 30:47.487
Is that "eat me" as in "I wanna talk"...

30:47.662 --> 30:51.598
...or "eat me"
as in "I'm unwilling to cooperate"?

30:55.603 --> 31:01.564
Eat me as in I'm not saying a word
without my lawyer, you dumb bitch.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.536
Okay.

31:07.248 --> 31:08.476
Hmm.

31:09.017 --> 31:10.917
Nice.

31:11.519 --> 31:13.350
I like business suits.

31:15.423 --> 31:16.651
Smile.

31:19.427 --> 31:21.395
Thank you, sir.

31:32.273 --> 31:36.266
Sorry, I had to do that.
You still have the other suspect.

31:38.580 --> 31:41.140
- Jesse Langhopher, a.k.a. Stomper?
- What?

31:41.316 --> 31:45.150
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can used against you.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.981
You have the right to an attorney.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.555
If you can't afford one,
the state will provide one.

31:49.724 --> 31:52.557
Your buddy Ted refused to talk to us.
You wanna talk?

31:52.727 --> 31:55.525
- No.
- Fine.

31:58.066 --> 32:01.365
Excellent work. Thank you for your help.
We'll take it from here.

32:01.536 --> 32:04.004
Where will you take it?
They're not gonna talk to you.

32:04.172 --> 32:07.699
I don't need them to. I'm gonna
take them home and then they'll confess.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.706
- Do you have the warrant?
- Sure do.

32:09.877 --> 32:12.675
Thank you. Pardon me, captain.

32:13.848 --> 32:17.011
I got a question. There a white man
on the police force these days, huh?

32:17.185 --> 32:20.951
- Have a seat in here, please.
- Miss Prisoner-Valet.

32:21.556 --> 32:24.184
Gentlemen, we may not have
enough evidence to hold you...

32:24.359 --> 32:28.193
...and since you've invoked your right
to counsel, I can't ask you any questions.

32:28.363 --> 32:32.424
So sit tight and if we don't find anything
at the house, you'll be free to go.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.000
Uh, Stomper, don't forget
what you and I talked about.

32:35.169 --> 32:36.898
What?

32:37.872 --> 32:40.602
- Hey, I want my bike back.
- Give these men some air.

32:40.775 --> 32:43.107
- Move the hell over.
- I'm trying, man.

32:43.277 --> 32:44.972
- Uh, good luck, sergeant.
- You too.

32:45.146 --> 32:48.115
- Damn, what's she talking about?
- I don't know, man.

32:53.154 --> 32:54.849
Thank you.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.387
- We have video and audio, chief.
- Okay.

33:00.561 --> 33:04.258
- And Lieutenant Tao is wearing an earpiece.
- Thank you, Buzz.

33:04.432 --> 33:06.900
You've set everything up
so that we succeed or fail...

33:07.068 --> 33:09.468
...based solely on the outcome
of this search.

33:09.637 --> 33:11.298
As you so rightly pointed out...

33:11.472 --> 33:14.100
...Teddy and Stomper had no reason
to come back for the car.

33:14.275 --> 33:15.435
But they did come back.

33:15.610 --> 33:19.011
So there must be something in this house
that they really, really want.

33:19.180 --> 33:21.910
- And now they're gonna help us find it.
- Oh!

33:22.984 --> 33:24.645
Yes. Oh!

33:24.819 --> 33:26.309
Excuse me, ugh.

33:26.487 --> 33:30.423
Lieutenant Tao,
give me a signal if you can hear me.

33:31.359 --> 33:33.054
Thank you.

33:35.596 --> 33:38.997
Buzz, do we have audio
for our boys in the car?

33:39.734 --> 33:42.134
<i>I told you
we shouldn't have brought that kid along.</i>

33:42.303 --> 33:46.672
<i>No, seriously. When they found him,
that just led them right to us.</i>

33:46.841 --> 33:50.299
Jesus, look. Kevin's dead. He can't talk.

33:50.478 --> 33:53.208
<i>- As long as you kept your mouth shut.
- What's that mean?</i>

33:53.381 --> 33:55.508
<i>When the cops jumped us,
you looked happy.</i>

33:55.683 --> 33:57.674
<i>We were caught.
What do you want me to do?</i>

33:57.852 --> 34:01.720
You were ready to jump down to all fours.
It was like you were back in the joint.

34:01.889 --> 34:05.484
- Oh, shut up, man.
- No, I'm not gonna shut up.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.527
Dude, hey, look. Your flag.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.792
Son of a bitch.

34:16.003 --> 34:18.096
I told you.
We should have dumped everything.

34:18.272 --> 34:19.795
No way.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.804
If they look hard
they're gonna find it.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.172
<i>Oh, they can look in that house all day.
They never gonna find anything.</i>

34:25.780 --> 34:28.214
Okay. There's nothing in the house.

34:28.382 --> 34:31.283
Lieutenant Tao,
would y'all please check the back yard?

34:31.452 --> 34:33.112
Back yard, fellows.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.929
That blond lady cop.

34:43.397 --> 34:45.728
- You know her?
- No, man.

34:45.900 --> 34:50.132
<i>Well, then what did she mean, "Stomper,
remember what we talked about"?</i>

34:50.304 --> 34:52.704
<i>Nothing. I don't know.
She just told me my rights.</i>

34:52.873 --> 34:54.864
<i>- Yeah. I'm sure of that.
- I swear.</i>

34:55.042 --> 34:58.409
I'm wondering, you got a loose tongue
to go along with that green thumb?

34:58.579 --> 34:59.841
No.

35:00.014 --> 35:02.312
"Green thumb"? Lieutenant Tao...

35:02.483 --> 35:06.681
...uh, I seem to remember Teddy's aunt
saying something about fresh flowers.

35:10.391 --> 35:11.415
Oh, no.

35:15.730 --> 35:18.358
<i>- Damn it!
- This is bad, man. This is so bad.</i>

35:18.533 --> 35:20.728
Okay, I think we're getting closer.

35:20.902 --> 35:22.563
<i>Come on.</i>

35:24.272 --> 35:27.264
Lieutenant,
what's under the planter to the left?

35:29.944 --> 35:31.605
No, no, no. Your left.

35:50.531 --> 35:51.896
<i>What did you tell her, huh?</i>

35:52.066 --> 35:54.227
I swear on my mother, man.
I didn't say anything.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.802
<i>- Yeah, you did!
- No, I didn't. I swear.</i>

35:56.971 --> 35:59.804
<i>- Look, I didn't roll on you, Teddy.
- There's our evidence.</i>

35:59.974 --> 36:02.602
<i>I didn't tell her anything.
I swear. You gotta believe me.</i>

36:02.777 --> 36:03.801
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

36:03.978 --> 36:05.673
<i>You'd to come out shooting.</i>

36:05.847 --> 36:07.371
I wanted to keep on driving.

36:07.548 --> 36:09.539
<i>You're as guilty as I am. I swear.</i>

36:09.717 --> 36:12.709
If you rolled on me,
I will cut your throat so fast.

36:13.855 --> 36:16.050
I didn't roll on you, man.

36:16.224 --> 36:19.057
Look, I didn't roll on you, Teddy.
Calm down.

36:19.227 --> 36:21.695
And there's our confession.

36:35.743 --> 36:38.507
Officer? Thank you.

36:41.582 --> 36:43.482
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer.

36:43.651 --> 36:47.849
That's okay, I have your confession on our
little camera here. Say hello, gentlemen.

36:48.022 --> 36:49.353
What?

36:51.859 --> 36:53.622
Say goodbye.

36:56.130 --> 37:01.124
Got an M-16, AK-47
and a big bag of crystal meth.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.792
Excellent work, gentlemen.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.562
What are you doing?

37:04.739 --> 37:06.468
Teddy, what you're doing?

37:08.776 --> 37:13.110
Teddy, don't do anything stupid.
They're all right there, Teddy.

37:13.281 --> 37:15.374
- Just shut up, bitch!
- Chief.

37:15.549 --> 37:19.041
- Looks like he must've slipped his cuffs.
- Teddy! Teddy!

37:19.220 --> 37:20.983
You little bitch snitch!

37:21.155 --> 37:22.816
I suppose we should do something.

37:26.060 --> 37:29.052
You little bitch! You little...!

37:31.966 --> 37:34.992
Now, now, now, captain.
There's no police involvement.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.433
Unless Teddy kills him,
it's not your problem.

37:37.605 --> 37:40.233
Chief Johnson, you gotta do something.
Right now.

37:40.408 --> 37:42.000
All right. Officer.

37:43.210 --> 37:44.905
- Detective Sanchez.
- You little bitch!

37:54.322 --> 37:55.812
Sorry for the wait, captain.

37:55.990 --> 37:59.653
Wanted to make sure that our use of force
was appropriate and responsible.

38:21.515 --> 38:23.346
Chief Johnson.

38:24.251 --> 38:26.048
Captain Raydor.

38:27.121 --> 38:28.520
I see you made your deadline.

38:28.689 --> 38:33.058
Yes, ma'am. Officers Stern and Duran
have been completely exonerated.

38:35.162 --> 38:38.290
And because of the way
Force Investigation Division operates...

38:38.466 --> 38:41.731
...I'll be investigating the murder
of more good cops just like them.

38:42.269 --> 38:43.293
Excuse me?

38:43.471 --> 38:46.133
When officers are shot and killed
in the line of duty...

38:46.307 --> 38:47.865
...they're investigated by me.

38:48.042 --> 38:50.943
When they shoot back,
they're investigated by you.

38:51.645 --> 38:54.580
That means that they'll think twice
before defending themselves.

38:54.749 --> 38:58.082
That hesitation will mean
that more good cops will die.

38:59.787 --> 39:03.314
I have to ask, have you ever considered
what your principles cost?

39:04.725 --> 39:07.660
Seventy million dollars.

39:08.062 --> 39:11.498
That was the settlement
in the Rampart case.

39:11.665 --> 39:13.530
One hundred.

39:14.435 --> 39:18.428
That's how many convictions were
overturned due to renegade policing...

39:18.606 --> 39:20.870
...and lack of oversight
in one division alone...

39:21.042 --> 39:26.241
...not to mention the loss of trust
the L.A.P.D. needs to remain effective.

39:30.051 --> 39:33.578
- There has to be a better way.
- Well...

39:34.922 --> 39:36.412
...until then, you've got me.

39:40.227 --> 39:42.923
- Well, I see you're going to the funeral.
- Yeah.

39:44.098 --> 39:47.033
Don't worry. I have my own car.

40:07.855 --> 40:09.880
- Everyone ready?
- I think so.

40:11.325 --> 40:12.792
Today...

40:14.061 --> 40:16.154
...is for honoring our fallen.

40:17.198 --> 40:19.758
And the fact that we can now do that...

40:20.167 --> 40:22.692
...with their killers in custody...

40:23.070 --> 40:26.767
...is the best thing that you could do
for their families...

40:28.275 --> 40:29.572
...and loved ones.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.543
You've not only done your jobs...

40:33.047 --> 40:36.414
...you've helped to ease their pain.

40:38.018 --> 40:40.350
And for that I thank you.

40:41.555 --> 40:43.580
It's our privilege, sir.

40:50.331 --> 40:51.821
- Thank you.
- Oh.

41:13.154 --> 41:16.021
It's just the six of us again, lieutenant.

41:20.995 --> 41:22.758
For now.
