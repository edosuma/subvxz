You were waiting for me at the resleeve
facility before I even needlecast in.

44:31.752 --> 44:32.878
You were onto me before I...

44:32.961 --> 44:35.714
Because I knew you were a danger,
which you clearly are.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.592
I should be getting a fuckin' medal
for shutting that place down.

44:39.176 --> 44:41.553
- Who's Ryker?
- I don't know.

44:41.637 --> 44:44.277
Only way it makes sense that
you were tracking me before I got here

44:44.306 --> 44:46.600
was that you weren't tracking me at all.

44:48.143 --> 44:49.353
You were tracking him.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.980
I really couldn't give a shit
about what sleeve you're wearing.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.732
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:55.818 --> 44:56.819
What the fuck?

45:13.335 --> 45:15.045
- Still don't give a shit?
- No.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.005
Stab yourself in the dick for all I care.

45:19.508 --> 45:23.262
- See, Dimi here, he kept calling me Ryker.
- Because he was crazy.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.180
Who's Ryker to you?

45:25.848 --> 45:26.848
Nobody.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.517
Nobody, huh?

45:36.108 --> 45:37.943
- We worked together.
- And?

45:38.026 --> 45:39.027
No "and."

45:44.908 --> 45:46.535
No, no, no.

45:46.618 --> 45:49.997
No, just stop it, stop it! Please.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.001
Please, just stop it. I...

45:57.421 --> 45:58.797
