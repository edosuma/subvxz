I should be getting a fuckin' medal
for shutting that place down.

44:39.176 --> 44:41.553
- Who's Ryker?
- I don't know.

44:41.637 --> 44:44.277
Only way it makes sense that
you were tracking me before I got here

44:44.306 --> 44:46.600
was that you weren't tracking me at all.

44:48.143 --> 44:49.353
You were tracking him.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.980
I really couldn't give a shit
about what sleeve you're wearing.

Who's Ryker to you?

45:25.848 --> 45:26.848
Nobody.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.517
Nobody, huh?

45:36.108 --> 45:37.943
- We worked together.
- And?

45:38.026 --> 45:39.027
No "and."
