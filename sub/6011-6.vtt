00:35.560 --> 00:37.755
Shouldn't the hot toast come
to me first, Daisy?

00:37.840 --> 00:39.319
Sorry, Mr Carson.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.072
Why is Alfred getting special treatment?

00:41.160 --> 00:42.559
I'm sure he's not.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.271
Why is he getting special treatment?

00:47.360 --> 00:49.999
Why do you think?
Because he's staying here with us.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.109
Oh, this is nice.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.198
Mr Napier and Mr Blake
are coming up in a few days.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.513
He asks if I'm serious about
their staying here.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.589
And are you?

01:00.680 --> 01:02.830
Certainly. It could be useful.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.750
They're writing a report on why estates
like this are going wrong.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.316
But you don't think Downton's
going wrong, do you, m'lady?

01:09.480 --> 01:12.472
No. But I wouldn't mind having it confirmed.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.879
You seem brighter lately.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.152
Have things sorted themselves out?

01:19.080 --> 01:21.833
Not quite, but it's better, yes.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.278
And you've moved back into the cottage?

01:24.920 --> 01:26.069
I have, m'lady.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.638
Well, you're obviously not going
to tell me what it was about,

01:30.120 --> 01:31.678
but I'm glad if it's resolved.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.988
Nothing for me?

01:35.160 --> 01:36.149
'Fraid not.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.596
This is a fine kettle of fish, I must say.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.676
Your uncle Harold is in a proper fix.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.068
Why? What's he done this time?

01:42.440 --> 01:44.317
Something to do with oil leases.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.311
- Who's Uncle Harold?
- Cora's brother.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.869
I always think him rather good at business...
If nothing else.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.430
But he seems to have backed a
very lame horse this time.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.993
Why is he bothering you with it?

01:53.920 --> 01:55.319
I'm not entirely sure.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.556
- What's that?
- It's about the Tamworths.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.154
We have Tamworths at Duneagle.
Daddy swears by them.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.959
It's a new thing for us.
We haven't done much with pigs before.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.315
I thought you were convinced.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.988
I am but I'm allowed to be nervous.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.957
Intensive farming's a big step.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.952
Half past 8:00. I must skedaddle.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.549
Penny for your thoughts.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.632
You'd pay twice that not to know them.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.916
- Lf there was anything I could do...
- I know.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.632
It's not your fault, it's mine.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.837
Your husband is a brooder.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.278
And brooders brood.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.748
Then brood about me.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.150
I'm making an anchovy sauce for the fish
soufflÃ©. Do you want to watch?

02:38.160 --> 02:39.354
No. You're alright.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.832
His heart's not in it any more.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.878
Oh, I think it is.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.918
But when you fall off a horse, you need
a bit of time to get back in the saddle.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.919
Cousin Cora?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.758
I think you can call me Cora now.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.229
I wouldn't dare with cousin Robert.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.908
You must dare with me. How can I help?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.189
I...

03:04.520 --> 03:08.229
I wanted to tell you that
I've settled the surprise. For his birthday.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.193
Since you won't tell me what it is,
I don't know what to say. Good?

03:11.880 --> 03:13.677
Well, the thing is,

03:13.880 --> 03:15.836
I need Carson to keep the secret.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.955
Do you think he will?

03:17.560 --> 03:19.949
It's only on the day,
and it's only 'til after dinner.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.795
Mrs Hughes is the one for a secret.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.878
Yes. That's true.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.638
And it'll be she who has to deal with it.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.151
Second post, your ladyship.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.229
Thank you, Spratt.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.832
You haven't taken the <i>netsuke</i> carving
from here?

03:44.840 --> 03:47.400
You know the one I mean,
the little ivory fisherman?

03:47.480 --> 03:49.550
I know it, but I've not touched it.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.558
Not to wash it or mend it or something?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.908
No.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.078
And who else has been in this room
in the last day or so?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.788
The maids, of course, and young Pegg.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.799
He was watering the pot plants
but Betty was with him.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.589
Watching all the time?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.470
Well, no, she was cleaning.
But I wouldn't want her blamed.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.398
Oh, I wouldn't blame her.

04:10.520 --> 04:14.672
You know, of course,
the <i>netsuke</i> is very valuable?

04:15.640 --> 04:18.677
That's the risk with little things.
They fit into a pocket easily.

04:19.040 --> 04:23.192
I have a feeling most things would fit
into this particular pocket.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.353
- Thank you, Spratt.
- M'lady.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.795
We have to get the sums right.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.355
We must speculate to accumulate.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.677
So speaks the American half of you.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.308
Will you really go to America?

04:36.640 --> 04:39.632
Don't worry. I won't go until the pig
business is up and running.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.558
We can give you masses of introductions,

04:43.440 --> 04:46.159
Grandmama and Uncle Harold for a start.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.749
Lord Grantham got a letter
from him this morning.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.909
It wasn't good news.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.355
I shouldn't worry.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.030
It only means a yacht's gone aground
or a girl's gone back to mother.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.669
That's not what it sounded like.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.393
Right, I'll get the car.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.434
Anything to report?

05:08.240 --> 05:10.071
It's nothing, I'm sure.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.349
But Lady Rose seems to have some secret
she wants Mrs Hughes to keep.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.675
That's more like it.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.509
What secret?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.673
I don't know, but it'll be nothing.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.035
Now I must take this up.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.194
You were dismissed?

05:29.640 --> 05:30.709
From one minute to the next?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.397
Mr Maley came over, said I wasn't needed
no more and that was that.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.193
It's disgraceful!

05:37.880 --> 05:39.199
Is there nothing you can do about it?

05:39.760 --> 05:42.479
No. But I don't understand it.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.630
I had a good touch with the greenhouses.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.359
I did all the house plants. I was working well.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.028
- I know I was.
- I'm sure.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.633
Right, I'll see if I can get to the bottom of this.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.708
I'm very grateful, your ladyship.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.631
I'm not your lady... Oh, never mind.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.198
- A band?
- Shh.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.757
No one must know.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.673
We'll get the carpets rolled up
and everything arranged during dinner,

06:06.800 --> 06:10.349
so that when his lordship walks
out of the dining room, there it is.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.556
And we're to hide them? Until then?

06:12.760 --> 06:14.637
Oh, "Hide them."

06:14.840 --> 06:16.193
You just have to keep them with you.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.072
His lordship won't come down here, will he?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.751
So I've to find them food and beds?
How many are there?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.677
Six, I think. But I'll check.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.433
And her ladyship knows about it?

06:26.080 --> 06:28.958
Well, not that it's a band because it's
a surprise for her, too.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.676
But she knows that there is a surprise
and that you're helping me with it.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.309
Very well. I'll see what I can do.

06:35.760 --> 06:36.909
Thank you.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.871
I wonder why Lady Rose was down here.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.350
And I am afraid you will continue to wonder.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.957
That's very mysterious, Mrs Hughes.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.073
You know me, Mr Barrow.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.788
A woman of mystery if ever there was one.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.071
But her secret won't affect us.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.668
How can you be so sure?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.192
Now you have got me worried.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.030
I am sorry to hear that, Mr Barrow.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.191
But now, you must let me get on.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.878
All I know is this.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.755
I find Pegg in this room
and my paper knife is gone.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.913
He comes into the room again,

07:21.120 --> 07:24.635
and a very valuable piece of
Japanese <i>netsuke</i> is missing.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.228
Things, things, things!

07:27.720 --> 07:30.473
I don't understand your position.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.956
Are you saying he's justified
in stealing my possessions?

07:34.040 --> 07:35.473
Or do you not believe he took them?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.989
I am saying you put too much importance
on material objects

07:38.080 --> 07:40.310
- and not enough on justice.
- Oh, really.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.678
I wonder you don't just set fire to the Abbey
and dance round it,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.313
painted with woad and howling.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.278
I might, if it would do any good.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.509
Ha, well...

07:51.120 --> 07:52.394
I beg your pardon, your ladyship.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.152
No, don't apologise.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.152
I am glad to have an ally in the room.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.358
This was found in Betty's cleaning bucket.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.835
It must've rolled in there
and she's just found it.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.679
Oh?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.991
Thank you, thank you.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.514
I'm very relieved.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.429
Relieved or irritated?

08:14.480 --> 08:15.674
If that will be all, m'lady?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.039
Aren't you going to say you're sorry?

08:23.360 --> 08:24.349
Certainly not.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.636
He may not have taken this...

08:26.800 --> 08:30.190
Or he may have sneaked it into the
maid's bucket when we weren't looking.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.118
How you hate to be wrong!

08:33.720 --> 08:35.039
I wouldn't know.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.111
I am not familiar with the sensation.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.750
So you're determined to dig in your heels?

08:40.000 --> 08:44.869
I am sorry, but whether or not he took this,
he certainly took the knife.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.438
That is all I have to say on the subject.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.828
Edith?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.994
Whatever's the matter?

09:01.480 --> 09:03.198
Michael's vanished into thin air.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.114
Nobody's heard from him,

09:05.560 --> 09:06.549
no one can reach him.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.920
I'm sure it's just a failure of communication.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.117
If anything had happened, we'd have heard.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.029
Maybe.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.031
I just wish to God he'd pick up the telephone.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.874
He will.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.709
Come on.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.354
We ought to get changed.

09:25.480 --> 09:29.917
The last post.
One for me and one for you, Alfred.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.593
I've got it!

09:39.040 --> 09:40.109
It's from the Ritz.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.108
One of the chosen candidates has got a job
and dropped out of the course and I was next.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.437
I was fifth. See, Jimmy, I was the fifth!

09:47.800 --> 09:48.994
I never said you weren't.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.399
So they want you, do they?

09:50.960 --> 09:53.190
Yes. I'll have some catching up to do,
but I don't mind that.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.913
Alfred, I'm so pleased for you.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.399
- We all are.
- That's right.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.515
Thank you. Thank you very much.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.431
- Well, when do you go?
- Well, as soon as I can, really.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.159
The less I miss, the less I'm behind.
But it's up to Mr Carson.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.675
I have no wish to stand in your way, Alfred.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.354
I'm sure I can manage
with James and Mr Barrow.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.913
So I can go? Now?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.753
Wait until tomorrow.
We ought to let the family know.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.911
Aren't you going to congratulate him, Daisy?

10:14.360 --> 10:17.318
Daisy, run into the kitchen and put the
kettle on. You can leave that there.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.359
If you need anything washing through,
give it to me tonight.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.431
And me. We'll get you shipshape.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.873
I'm quite nervous, now it's happened.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.393
What's there to be nervous about?

10:27.600 --> 10:30.319
You're nervous because
you're intelligent, Alfred.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.790
Only stupid people are foolhardy.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.988
- I'm ever so sorry, Daisy.
- Are you?

10:39.520 --> 10:41.238
When you're the one that's driven him away?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.074
How do you make that out?

10:43.360 --> 10:47.558
Because, you wanted Jimmy and not him
and that's why he were forced to go.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.909
But you knew that.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.673
Come on, girls. Dry your tears
and let's get on with the dinner.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.678
Ivy, come and beat these eggs.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.229
You're back.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.392
I thought you must have missed the last train.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.751
No, but I only just caught it.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.355
- Do you want some dinner?
- I ate in the restaurant car.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.038
You weren't very long in London.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.468
There wasn't much to do,

11:10.560 --> 11:14.075
just sign some papers for a trust
that Billy Sheffield's set up for his son.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.479
What will that entail?

11:15.560 --> 11:18.677
Mainly telling the boy to drink less
and to be nicer to his mother.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.751
We learned at dinner that Alfred's leaving.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.270
He's got a place in the Ritz cookery course,
after all.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.515
Ah?

11:25.160 --> 11:26.434
I'm sorry to cut and run, m'lord.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.437
Don't worry about that. We're proud of you.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.710
You must return one day, as a famous chef.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.476
Now you're back, m'lord,
there's something I wanted to say.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.636
I've been well treated in this house. And I
wanted you all to know that I'm very grateful.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.875
Thank you, Alfred.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.799
Mr Carson has been a kind

11:44.040 --> 11:45.314
and wonderful teacher.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.390
Much more and we shall all burst into tears.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.719
I'm sorry, my lord.
Come along, Alfred, let's get back to work.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.230
How's my birthday dinner coming on?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.558
How do you know about the dinner?

12:00.640 --> 12:03.518
The Colthursts rang yesterday
and said they'd love to come.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.034
Weren't we all sworn to secrecy?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.838
Golly, people are so hopeless.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.117
I don't mind. It won't spoil it if it's
not a surprise. Not for me.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.958
There may still be a surprise.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.595
So I should hope.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.555
So, what about tomorrow?

12:19.640 --> 12:20.709
I know you'll enjoy it.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.949
What are you going to see?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.268
<i>The Sheik.</i>

12:23.440 --> 12:26.591
Ooh, I like that Rudolph Valentino.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.554
Oh, he makes me shiver all over.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.431
What a very disturbing thought.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.718
Let us go for a date.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.353
We could leave when we've dressed them,
and be back in time to put them to bed.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.951
Lady Mary wouldn't mind.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.109
Why not?

12:42.240 --> 12:45.915
It's been a long time
since we went out to dine. Too long.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.999
I quite agree.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.197
Will you send a message to Mr Molesley
in the morning?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.919
- Why should I?
- Because Alfred's going.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.553
- So?
- Won't you need him, now?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.278
I'll need a new footman, yes.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.473
But Mr Molesley has, as the saying goes,
had his chance and missed it.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.437
You don't mean that.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.352
Not when he agreed to come last time.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.268
Yes, he agreed.
Much as Kaiser Bill agreed to abdicate.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.510
With the greatest possible reluctance.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.795
- But surely...
- I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.789
Young Alfred gave thanks tonight
for the courtesy and the kindness

13:17.880 --> 13:20.519
that he has received here,
both from the family and from me.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.034
And that is what I like to see. Gratitude.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.236
I don't want someone who has to be
dragged into the house by his heels.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.157
Yes, but Mr Molesley has had a lot to...

13:29.240 --> 13:33.631
A lot to put up with? We've all had a
lot to put up with, Mrs Patmore,

13:33.800 --> 13:37.349
and it is not made easier by working with
people who don't want to be here.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.632
It may be worse than you think.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.709
It wouldnât surprise me if they were

13:42.800 --> 13:44.074
getting ready to lay some people off.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.237
Why would that concern Lady Rose?

13:46.480 --> 13:48.198
I'm not sure,

13:48.280 --> 13:50.874
but Mrs Hughes seems to think
we could all be affected.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.271
You've got to find out more.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.315
But how?

13:56.560 --> 13:57.709
You'll think of something.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.031
I'll arrange something tomorrow,

14:13.120 --> 14:14.189
book somewhere special.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.474
If you like.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.478
I know it can't be the same as it used to be.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.397
I don't deceive myself about that.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.072
But I want to make some new memories,

14:28.840 --> 14:30.193
good memories,

14:30.760 --> 14:32.796
so it's not as if all our happiness was before.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.678
I'm happy, whenever I look at you.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.752
But you're not, are you?

14:47.560 --> 14:49.039
Everything is shadowed.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.792
Every moment we share is shadowed.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.759
You're right.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.549
Let's have one evening
when we don't think about it.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.159
We leave it all behind.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.959
Thank you.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.111
Tonight, I'll change before the gong.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.188
I've a committee meeting and then we're
all dining together in some frightful hotel.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.599
I should leave around 6:00.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.159
What would you like to wear, m'lady?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.073
Well, I don't want to insult them,

15:20.320 --> 15:21.548
I should look as if I've tried...

15:21.640 --> 15:24.234
Elegant but sensible. I know.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.354
I'll let you choose, thank you.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.913
Don't forget to write.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.434
And good luck.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.439
I know you'll get what you want.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.716
Do you? Cause I don't always.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.595
Just remember, you're as good as any
Frenchman. I don't care what they say.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.275
Ah, you're off. Well, all the luck in the world.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.033
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- That gives you a bit of leeway.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.997
- Where's Daisy?
- In the kitchen.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.719
Right, there's a car waiting to take you.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.829
I've just got to...

16:02.280 --> 16:03.269
I'm off.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.708
Goodbye, then.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.353
Daisy, I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.040
You're a good person and you're going to
make some man very happy one day.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.519
But I'm afraid it were never going to be me.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.109
Good luck.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.029
I mean it.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.793
You work hard and you know what you want.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.913
I hope you do well, Alfred. I think you will.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.910
Alfred! Come along!
You've not a minute to lose!

16:30.480 --> 16:32.789
Thank you, Daisy. That means a lot to me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.159
An awful lot.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.512
Ah, thank you, Mr Carson.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.515
Good morning, ma'am.

16:52.520 --> 16:56.035
I'm afraid you've just missed her ladyship
and she'll be gone for some time.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.508
What a shame.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.513
Thank you.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.628
Oh, er...

17:02.160 --> 17:03.673
Oh, my goodness.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.233
I feel a bit dizzy.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.070
Might I sit down for a moment?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.992
Of course, ma'am. Please come in.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.751
May I fetch you a glass of water?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.512
No, thank you, Spratt.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.077
I just need to sit quietly for a few minutes.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.878
Certainly, ma'am.
Please ring if you need anything.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.869
Eureka!

18:09.280 --> 18:14.229
You've been kind, but I'm feeling
much better, so, I'll be on my way.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.752
Oh!

18:18.400 --> 18:21.870
Would you give this to
Lady Grantham on her return?

18:22.520 --> 18:25.751
I found it down the side
of the chair I was sitting in.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.115
She will be pleased.
She was very upset at its loss.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.918
I hope she'll be pleased.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.192
I'm not certain that she will,

18:33.120 --> 18:34.394
but I hope so.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.068
Mr Molesley? What can I do for you?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.792
I was at the station this morning...

18:54.560 --> 18:57.313
We're... We're renewing the gravel out front,

18:57.400 --> 19:00.119
and, er, I ran into young Alfred.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.274
He was off on his way to London.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.549
Yes.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.949
So, er,

19:07.040 --> 19:09.031
as he is going after all, I thought

19:10.600 --> 19:15.355
I'd look in, to confirm
my willingness to return to Downton.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.274
Mr Molesley,

19:17.440 --> 19:20.830
I am glad you are, as you put it, "willing".

19:21.720 --> 19:24.632
But I cannot feel the word expresses

19:24.720 --> 19:28.030
the kind of enthusiasm
I'm looking for in a new footman.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.708
- What?
- When we last discussed it,

19:31.200 --> 19:36.718
you made it quite clear that you didn't wish to
plunge down the ladder of preferment.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.949
I was...

19:38.040 --> 19:39.075
I was willing to.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.711
As you keep saying,
but I don't want to humiliate you.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.794
You feel you're meant for
better things and I won't contradict you.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.511
Unfortunately, we have no higher place
to offer in this house.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.872
I know, but I said...

19:54.960 --> 19:56.871
And you have your pride

19:57.360 --> 19:59.191
and I respect you for it.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.313
Good day, Mr Molesley.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.629
Mrs Crawley and Dr Clarkson, your ladyship.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.513
Oh? To what do I owe this treat?

20:18.880 --> 20:22.156
Lady Grantham, you've already changed
fordinner. We'll, er...

20:22.240 --> 20:23.275
We'll come back tomorrow.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.636
No. My curiosity would
not brook such a delay.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.671
Did Spratt give you the paper knife?

20:28.760 --> 20:29.829
Yes.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.959
Then it's quite clear that
Pegg did not steal it?

20:33.880 --> 20:35.108
Or are you going to argue now

20:35.200 --> 20:36.315
that he sneaked it back in here when he

20:36.400 --> 20:37.879
realised what kind of trouble he was in?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.470
Well...

20:40.560 --> 20:41.675
It's a thought.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.875
But a despicable one!

20:43.880 --> 20:47.759
What can I say to persuade you
out of your injustice and stubbornness!

20:48.480 --> 20:50.198
Can't you see the damage you do!

20:50.280 --> 20:53.556
Now, hold your horses, Mrs Crawley.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.758
Lady Grantham has a right of reply.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.991
Thank you, Dr Clarkson.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.149
Now, if you will put up

20:59.240 --> 21:00.958
your cudgels for a moment...

21:01.760 --> 21:06.231
Oh, Spratt, has the young gardener, Pegg,
brought in the vegetables yet?

21:06.320 --> 21:07.309
What?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.549
He's in the kitchen now, m'lady.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.710
Yes, please ask him to step in here.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.196
Into the drawing room, your ladyship?

21:13.320 --> 21:16.756
Well, ask him to remove his boots,
if that will soothe your nerves.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.435
I don't understand.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.676
No, if you wish to understand things,

21:23.760 --> 21:26.593
you must come out from behind your
prejudice and listen.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.636
- Your ladyship?
- Yes.

21:33.720 --> 21:38.919
Could you give an account to Mrs Crawley
of what transpired between us this afternoon?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.752
Erm, sorry, m'lady?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.592
Tell her what I said to you.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.749
Her ladyship sent for me, so I came.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.230
She said she'd been mistaken
in saying that I were a thief,

21:48.520 --> 21:50.078
which she knew now to be untrue.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.390
She gave me my job back, said she were sorry

21:52.640 --> 21:53.959
and asked if I could forgive her.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.190
- Which you have.
- I certainly have, Doctor.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.191
Thank you. You may go.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.073
Out. Come on.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.432
Well?

22:07.440 --> 22:08.429
Well...

22:08.520 --> 22:11.717
I'd say that was game,
set and match to Lady Grantham.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.159
You're dining at the Netherby?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.108
I know. It's quite something, isn't it, m'lady?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.838
I don't think we've eaten in a hotel
since before we were married.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.475
You don't mind, do you?

22:25.960 --> 22:28.155
Not at all. And don't rush back.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.990
It won't kill me to get myself to bed.

22:31.320 --> 22:32.719
I'll be back, don't you worry.

22:35.160 --> 22:39.153
Did I tell you that Mr Napier and
Mr Blake will be here in time for dinner

22:39.240 --> 22:41.071
on his lordship's birthday?

22:41.760 --> 22:43.398
Rather a baptism of fire.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.679
How long are they going to stay?

22:46.240 --> 22:49.038
I'm not sure. It's open-ended.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.871
Which Granny would never approve of.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.993
Bates?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.313
I don't seem to have it.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.119
Could you look again?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.955
Because we definitely made a reservation.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.918
Maybe each of you thought
that the other one had done it?

23:10.040 --> 23:12.873
- I made the booking.
- I'm afraid we're very full tonight.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.038
The Countess of Grantham
has a large party with her.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.355
Lady Grantham's here?

23:17.440 --> 23:20.512
Among our patrons are some of the
greatest names in Yorkshire Society

23:21.480 --> 23:23.072
and the Countess is among them.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.149
Yes, we know her.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.033
Oh, these people are claiming to know you,
your ladyship.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.633
- Well, we... We didn't...
- I know them both very well indeed.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.119
Are you dining here tonight, Anna?

23:34.280 --> 23:37.352
We were, but there seems to be
a mix-up with the table.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.476
Well, I'm sure it can be sorted out?

23:40.080 --> 23:41.991
In a jiffy, m'lady, in a jiffy.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.395
If you would like to wait one moment.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.990
Well, that seems to have made
a difference. Thank God he's a snob.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.672
But m'lady, I promise you we never...

23:51.800 --> 23:54.712
I'm sure not,
but don't let's spoil the effect now.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.108
To be honest, I wish I could join you,
but I'd better get back.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.758
Well, if you'd like to follow me?

24:17.120 --> 24:20.430
And, er, please excuse the little hiccup earlier.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.193
It will be the last.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.519
Ah, yes.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.679
I do apologise, my lady,

24:30.840 --> 24:34.230
but this came in the evening post
and it appears to have been overlooked.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.435
Not to worry.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.515
Is anything the matter?

24:49.600 --> 24:51.830
No. Not all.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.272
Why Mr Molesley,

24:59.800 --> 25:00.915
how can we help you?

25:01.280 --> 25:03.271
I was wondering,

25:04.040 --> 25:07.350
if by any chance, er,
Mr Carson had changed his mind.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.954
I'm afraid not.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.919
I...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.753
I'd have thought he'd value my caution,

25:15.840 --> 25:20.072
my wanting to weigh up the pros
and cons before rushing in.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.559
So is this it, then?

25:24.320 --> 25:26.151
Do I just go back to mending the roads?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.994
Oh, don't give up so easily.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.670
Now, let me get some more hot water.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.391
Look, there's a seat over there.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.391
Let's sit down. We're not in a hurry.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.919
If you say so.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.235
It's such a lovely night.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.436
Look at that moon.
It's as bright as a light bulb.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.636
So what do you make of this
Valentino chappie then?

26:02.240 --> 26:04.470
- Is he your type?
- He is not.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.788
I think he's slithery.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.395
If I were Agnes Ayres,
I'd have gone straight back to London

26:08.480 --> 26:09.549
as quick as I could find a boat.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.594
So you don't like romance?

26:12.200 --> 26:14.475
Well, I wouldn't say that.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.435
Get off! Will you get off me!

26:37.440 --> 26:38.793
I've been good to you, Ivy.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.875
I've been polite. I've taken you
to the theatre and to the cinema.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.393
I've never been that nice to any girl before.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.999
Am I supposed to feel lucky?

26:45.480 --> 26:48.950
It's dishonest to grab a bloke for all he can
offer without giving him nothing in return.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.477
I don't think it's playing the game.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.551
Well, I'm not playing your game.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.437
You'd better get used to that idea!

26:59.960 --> 27:01.154
Here's to us.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.679
I'm sorry.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.190
I was a fool to think we could leave it behind.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.629
Don't be sorry.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.115
I'm sorry.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.313
But you see, every time
I remember what you've been through...

27:16.800 --> 27:17.789
...I want to murder.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.713
But I'm not a victim.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.749
That's not who I am.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.675
The worst part is that you see me as a victim.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.070
No, my darling.
I see you as a woman I should have protected.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.752
I'm the failure here, not you.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.239
Can I interrupt?

27:32.840 --> 27:35.195
I wondered if you'd like a lift home.
Stark's outside.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.358
That seems such an imposition.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.668
Not at all.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.834
And it should mean you'll get a table here
for the rest of your life.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.389
Mmm.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.556
Could we have our coats please?
The three of us?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.352
It would be my pleasure!

27:51.760 --> 27:53.193
This is very kind of you, m'lady.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.157
- Have you had a good evening?
- Yes.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.035
Yes, very good. Thank you.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.959
Well, don't sound so hesitant.
Or the Maitre d' will kill himself.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.959
No, we've had a lovely time.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.596
- He didn't hurt you?
- No.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.838
But he asked for things no man
should want before they're married.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.600
Yes, I think we're a bit more clear
about that than they are.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.710
I s'pose he's been sweet-talking me
so he could have his way.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.677
And all this time I thought he was so nice.

28:21.920 --> 28:25.071
I wonder how many women have said that
since the Norman Conquest.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.555
Alfred would never have done such a thing.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.915
- He had too much respect.
- Don't start.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.433
What do you mean?

28:31.560 --> 28:35.599
You break Alfred's heart,
so now he's alone in a city that terrifies him.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.394
You break my heart by driving him away.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.869
I don't care about your
good opinion of Alfred.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.838
If you'd discovered it earlier
you'd have spared us a lot of grief!

28:47.720 --> 28:48.948
What was all that about?

28:49.040 --> 28:52.157
Ooh, I'd say it was about the fact
that you had it coming.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.756
- It was nice of you to give them a lift.
- I was glad to, but...

29:02.560 --> 29:04.152
I may be mistaken, but,

29:04.280 --> 29:06.874
I'm afraid things have gone wrong
between those two.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.639
That's sad to hear.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.836
It's not just a case of a marriage gone sour.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.276
Anna's been hurt somehow and Bates
feels he should have protected her.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.476
I don't want any of that
to leave this room, Baxter.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.589
Of course not, m'lady.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.835
Edith,

29:28.920 --> 29:30.956
my most darling girl, what's the matter?

29:32.880 --> 29:35.155
But I'm not your most darling girl, am I?

29:36.080 --> 29:38.036
I love my children equally.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.757
I don't know why people say that,
when it's almost never true.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.671
Look. If this is about Michael Gregson,

29:44.760 --> 29:47.320
do you want me to get involved?
Send someone over there?

29:47.760 --> 29:48.829
No.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.835
His office has already done that.

29:52.080 --> 29:55.550
There's a detective in Munich now,
working with the German police.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.314
Then you just have to be patient.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.509
I want to know what's happened.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.993
If he's trapped somewhere,

30:04.080 --> 30:05.718
or falsely imprisoned,

30:06.480 --> 30:07.959
or even dead!

30:09.840 --> 30:11.114
I mean it.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.035
If the worst's happened, I want to know.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.440
It's just so impossible to plan in this...

30:19.960 --> 30:23.430
...fog.
- Well, I'm sure he's not dead.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.233
No, you aren't.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.518
Because none of us can be.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.030
But how was she "hurt"?
What happened to her?

30:40.000 --> 30:43.788
I'm just telling you what her ladyship
told Lady Mary. I don't know anything else.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.194
Then keep your ears open.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.079
I always do.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.875
What's the matter?

30:52.080 --> 30:54.150
I don't really like telling tales.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.231
You knew the conditions
when you came here.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.598
- I did.
- So what's changed?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.553
She's polite. She's...

31:03.560 --> 31:05.835
...considerate. I don't feel she's deserved it.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.309
Now, listen.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.950
What you have to decide
is where your first loyalties are.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.915
With her or with me?

31:16.880 --> 31:17.869
Alright.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.834
Have it your own way.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.239
Oh, I intend to.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.749
Thank you.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.279
It's so kind of you all to have us.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.629
Isn't it, Charles?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.069
It is.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.913
We're anxious to do our bit.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.989
What do you mean by that?

31:59.000 --> 32:03.118
Well, you're here to advise the landowners
on how to get through this crisis, aren't you?

32:03.400 --> 32:05.072
To save the estates that need saving?

32:05.440 --> 32:07.396
I'm afraid Evelyn may have given you
the wrong impression.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.275
In what way?

32:09.600 --> 32:11.318
The government is aware that,
up and down the country,

32:11.400 --> 32:12.958
great estates are being sold in large numbers.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.429
Precisely.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.317
North Yorkshire has a lot of these estates,

32:16.680 --> 32:18.830
big and small, and many are in difficulty.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.437
We will have every variety
of problem to study.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.073
And you're here to help.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.795
Not quite.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.868
We're here to analyse the situation and ask
whether our society is shifting fundamentally.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.318
Will it affect food production? And so on.

32:32.400 --> 32:36.678
So you don't care about the owners.
Just about food supply.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.837
If that's how you want to put it.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.435
- And doesn't that seem mean-spirited?
- Edith.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.715
Mr Lloyd George is more concerned
with feeding the population

32:43.800 --> 32:44.869
than rescuing the aristocracy.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.632
That doesn't seem mean-spirited to me.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.109
I'm afraid you may find
us disappointing guests,

32:49.200 --> 32:51.794
if you want us to stay up 'til 2:00
in the morning being witty.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.839
Don't worry. I don't expect
Mr Blake to be witty.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.828
How long will you be with us?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.751
Until the job is done and
we can write a report.

32:58.840 --> 32:59.829
If you'll have us.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.876
You must be sure to get rid of us
when we become a nuisance.

33:02.320 --> 33:05.357
The gong is rung at 7:00 and we meet
in the drawing room at 8:00.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.073
You know it's Robert's birthday?

33:07.480 --> 33:09.789
So you must try to be witty tonight, Mr Blake.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.036
After that, we'll lower our expectations.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.669
The girls will show you up.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.789
Hello, Mr Molesley.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.029
There's a chair here.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.235
No, I'm not here to eat.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.309
Why have you come, then?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.594
Mrs Hughes sent for me.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.318
She said that you had a big party tonight

33:25.400 --> 33:28.756
and it would be useful to Mrs Patmore
if I served the servants' tea.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.189
What?

33:30.560 --> 33:32.949
Mrs Patmore has a lot to do,

33:33.040 --> 33:35.110
Mr Molesley said he would help.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.634
To serve the servants' tea?

33:37.720 --> 33:39.551
He's not proud, Mr Carson.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.557
He wants to be useful where he can be.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.272
Oh, alright! I give in.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.634
I cannot fight a war on every front.

33:55.000 --> 33:55.989
Mr Carson?

33:56.280 --> 33:57.599
Look out a livery.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.591
You can start tonight, move in tomorrow.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.557
Thank you, Mr Carson. Very much.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.311
And don't forget the gloves!

34:10.199 --> 34:12.315
Lady Rose? Can I help?

34:12.400 --> 34:15.949
Oh, please don't let me disturb you,
but I wanted to make a speech.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.353
Mrs Hughes may have told you...

34:18.480 --> 34:19.708
I haven't yet.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.393
Well, we should tell them now.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.391
As a treat for his lordship,

34:23.480 --> 34:25.630
a London band is coming to play after dinner.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.876
A London band? That's the berries.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.632
From a nightclub called The Lotus.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.989
A nightclub, m'lady? Really?

34:32.120 --> 34:34.270
But it must be a complete surprise.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.476
No one knows anything and they mustn't.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.268
That is, her ladyship knows that
something's going to happen

34:39.360 --> 34:40.679
but even she doesn't know what.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.389
- And you think she'll be pleased?
- She'll be thrilled.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.748
We'll look after your secret.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.070
So, until then, if you can
just make them comfortable.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.156
I know musicians are
outside your daily round.

34:49.440 --> 34:53.034
Oh, don't worry about that, my lady.
We can take it in our stride.

34:53.280 --> 34:57.353
We may be Yorkshiremen,
but we do know a little of life in the city.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.559
Hello? Er, is anyone there?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.591
I think this is where we're supposed to be.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.552
Welcome to Downton!

35:21.680 --> 35:22.999
I thought I'd come up early

35:23.560 --> 35:25.391
and spend some time with George.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.195
I told Nanny I'd feed him,
but now you can do it.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.311
- He'd like that.
- Oh, I doubt it.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.753
He probably thinks,
"Who's this funny old lady?"

35:33.840 --> 35:34.829
But never mind.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.589
By the way,

35:39.240 --> 35:40.992
I thought I'd be Grandmama

35:41.080 --> 35:42.559
and then Cora can be Granny.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.958
And what about Sybbie?

35:45.040 --> 35:46.268
What should she call you?

35:46.360 --> 35:47.759
Well, Aunt Isobel, I think.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.837
I'm not quite her real aunt but I nearly am.

35:51.240 --> 35:54.471
Did I read somewhere that your friend
Lord Gillingham is engaged to be married?

35:54.600 --> 35:56.909
Yes. To Miss Lane Fox.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.113
I hope you don't mind.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.238
I should so hate for you to be unhappy.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.389
I'm not unhappy.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.514
I'm just not quite ready to be happy.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.598
When I got engaged, I was so in love
with Reginald, I felt sick.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.033
I was sick with love. Literally.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.675
It seems so odd to think about it now,
it really does.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.799
It was the same for me,

36:27.240 --> 36:29.959
as if I'd gone mad or
been hypnotised or something.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.511
For days, weeks,

36:33.760 --> 36:35.318
all I could think about was her.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.789
And me.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.150
I was standing outside in the snow

36:40.840 --> 36:42.239
and I didn't have a coat,

36:43.280 --> 36:44.918
but I wasn't cold,

36:45.760 --> 36:50.072
because all I kept thinking was,
"He's going to propose,

36:50.160 --> 36:51.559
"he's going to propose."

36:54.800 --> 36:55.869
Well.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.593
Aren't we the lucky ones?

36:59.960 --> 37:02.155
Oh, look who's here.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.152
- Hello!
- Hello, Sybbie.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.078
Have you never thought of visiting Africa?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.715
And why should I go to Africa, Mr Carson?

37:14.840 --> 37:16.159
I'm no more African than you are.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.078
Well, not much more.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.716
My people came over in the 1790s.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.149
We won't go into why or how.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.873
Oh, no, no, better left unsaid.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.593
Mr Ross,

37:26.680 --> 37:31.037
you've uncovered something about the past
that Mr Carson doesn't approve of. Well done.

37:31.160 --> 37:35.073
Not so fast, Mrs Hughes.
We led the world in the fight against slavery.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.357
Remember Lord Henley's judgement of 1763,

37:38.440 --> 37:42.831
"If a man sets foot on English soil,
then he is free."

37:43.040 --> 37:45.190
Don't undo Mr Ross' good work.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.837
Ivy, when I said that I...

37:56.440 --> 37:58.431
Oh, my goodness, is that the time?

37:58.640 --> 38:01.029
I'm first down. I just wanted to check
everything was on track.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.475
I've given them something to eat,
because they'll be playing

38:03.560 --> 38:05.039
when the servants are having their dinner.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.349
Yes, that's very kind of you.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.832
Wait 'til Carson has everyone securely
in their seats before you start setting up.

38:09.960 --> 38:10.949
I will.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.719
Well...

38:14.920 --> 38:15.989
She's quite a character.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.672
Lady Rose?

38:17.920 --> 38:19.319
That's one word for her.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.349
But I can't help feeling sorry
for the poor pigs.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.548
Do you eat bacon?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.389
Yes.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.995
Sausages?

38:38.320 --> 38:39.309
Yes.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.156
Then you are a sentimentalist
who cannot face the truth.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.830
I'm not often called sentimental.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.800
Your friend seems to be putting Mary
through her paces.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.553
I'm afraid Charles is challenged by
anyone with a sense of entitlement.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.796
You mean Mary feels entitled to take charge?

38:54.200 --> 38:55.349
Well, she's welcome to take charge of me.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.239
Molesley. Glad to be back?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.154
Surprised, more like, m'lady.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.594
But I s'pose I'll be called Joseph now.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.437
- I don't think I can manage that.
- Nor can I.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.557
Carson, you don't mind if we go on calling
Molesley, Molesley, do you?

39:13.400 --> 39:14.549
Of course not, m'lord.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.353
Why do you want to emigrate?

39:18.600 --> 39:21.068
Because I realise that I'll never
fit in at Downton.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.599
They're very fond of you here.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.029
I think they are,

39:26.200 --> 39:27.394
and I'm fond of them.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.355
I love them, really,

39:29.920 --> 39:31.592
though it surprises me to say it.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.517
But I'm not one of them and I
cannot make a life here.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.629
Why not?

39:39.440 --> 39:42.557
Would there be another Earl's daughter
who'd be keen to take me on, do you think?

39:42.800 --> 39:43.949
Well, I don't know.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.308
It would depend on her.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.273
No, she wouldn't.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.318
There aren't many as free as my Sybil.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.549
Well, I agree with that.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.955
So, should I bring a nice Irish
working girl to live here?

40:01.880 --> 40:03.518
Would that make everyone comfy?

40:05.680 --> 40:08.240
Isobel really appears to be coming
out of the mist.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.635
- I'm so pleased.
- Well, don't be too pleased.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.518
Part of her recovery is going back into battle.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.390
If she's fighting for her causes again,
that seems a good sign.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.079
A sign of what?

40:19.800 --> 40:22.758
That we should close the
shutters and bar the door?

40:22.840 --> 40:25.149
She likes to fight for what she believes in.

40:25.240 --> 40:28.869
Oh, no, it's not a matter
of what she likes. It is her fuel.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.793
Some people run on greed,

40:33.440 --> 40:34.714
lust, even love.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.595
She runs on indignation!

40:39.560 --> 40:41.312
I'm catching the ladies' eye.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.628
Oh, no!

40:42.960 --> 40:46.669
- Rose?
- No, we're not splitting tonight.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.028
We're all going out together!

40:48.320 --> 40:49.992
- What on earth is she talking about?
- What?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.035
Quick. Play.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.235
And a one, two, three.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.199
Happy birthday, cousin Robert!

40:57.320 --> 40:59.436
I say!

40:59.640 --> 41:03.918
<i>#I'm just wild about Harry</i>

41:04.000 --> 41:08.869
<i>#And Harry's wild about me</i>

41:08.960 --> 41:13.795
<i># The heavenly blisses of his kisses</i>

41:14.040 --> 41:18.431
<i>#Fill me with ecstasy</i>

41:18.560 --> 41:23.509
<i>#He's sweet just like chocolate candy</i>

41:24.120 --> 41:28.079
<i>#And just like honey from bees</i>

41:28.200 --> 41:30.430
Who is this singer and how did he get here?

41:31.440 --> 41:33.078
Isn't it rather odd?

41:33.520 --> 41:35.078
No, I think it's fun.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.475
<i></i>

41:41.600 --> 41:45.115
But, Granny, is it really suitable
that Rose has brought this man here?

41:45.920 --> 41:49.879
My dear, we country-dwellers must beware
of being provincial.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.589
Try and let your time in London
rub off on you a little more.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.840
I'd love to know which estates
you're going to examine.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.714
I'm sure you would.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.357
You mustn't be too discreet.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.476
After a while, it gets a little dull.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.033
You seem to have brought a traitor
into our midst.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.279
Not a traitor.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.959
An enemy, then.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.878
He's obviously not on our side.

42:27.640 --> 42:30.438
It is a bit wild. Jazz at Downton Abbey.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.916
I think it's lovely.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.390
You see, Tom, things can happen at Downton

42:36.480 --> 42:39.836
that no one imagined even a few years ago.

42:41.320 --> 42:44.676
Take heart from that,
before you throw in the towel.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.030
Is this your first experience of jazz,
Lady Grantham?

42:49.480 --> 42:51.072
Oh, is that what it is?

42:52.480 --> 42:56.917
Do you think any of them know
what the others are playing? Hmm?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.719
<i>#And he's just wild about</i>

42:59.800 --> 43:02.030
<i># Cannot do without</i>

43:02.160 --> 43:05.914
<i></i>

43:12.120 --> 43:13.553
Did you ask me to come down?

43:13.640 --> 43:16.473
I did. We've made some sandwiches
for you and the others,

43:16.560 --> 43:18.949
as I doubt you'll be off duty before midnight.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.230
We'll set a little table inside
the green baize door.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.913
They sound good
from down here.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.519
If you like that sort of thing.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.830
I thought Mr Ross was very nice.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.070
So did I, strange to relate.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.158
Though it's still an odd sort of thing
to be happening at Downton.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.037
It makes you want to jig about,
though, doesn't it?

43:34.320 --> 43:35.389
Certainly not!

43:45.320 --> 43:48.437
I think...
I think we've done enough now,

43:48.520 --> 43:50.158
you know, to show that we're good sports.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.229
Of course. Of course.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.670
I do think it was a brilliant idea,

43:55.240 --> 43:58.915
but it must be costing Rose a fortune.
Shall we chip in?

43:59.600 --> 44:00.828
Or pay it.

44:00.920 --> 44:02.717
Get the band leader to send me the bill.

44:03.320 --> 44:06.278
I'll go down at the end of the night
and catch him before he leaves.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.554
I'm afraid I don't share
your enthusiasm for her.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.669
Why not?

44:10.760 --> 44:13.274
She's the type who demands
all this as a right.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.759
But she wants it on a plate.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.630
She won't work for it and
she won't fight for it.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.672
And that type doesn't deserve to survive.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.792
I don't want to make trouble,

44:22.560 --> 44:24.949
but she feels much the same about you.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.599
Oh, Edith,

44:30.840 --> 44:32.751
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.078
How do you know something's wrong?

44:35.480 --> 44:37.198
Because I'm your mother.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.316
Is it Michael? Is there more news?

44:39.680 --> 44:40.749
Not really.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.552
He went to Munich a few weeks ago.
That's all they know.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.230
Well, of course you're worried.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.157
Well, it's not often that a birthday
surprise really is a surprise.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.271
I just hope we haven't shocked
the servants too much.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.317
Carson was ready to faint.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.512
Although, amazingly, he told me
that the band leader was,

45:05.600 --> 45:07.272
"Avery decent fellow, m'lord,"

45:07.360 --> 45:09.430
so perhaps we'll make a modern
of him, after all.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.073
I doubt it.

45:11.160 --> 45:14.516
Oh, and there's no news on Mr Gregson.
He's still missing.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.393
Edith told me.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.756
But I'm sure he'll be fine.

45:19.480 --> 45:21.755
By the way, did you ever read
that letter from Harold?

45:21.840 --> 45:24.229
I did and I've had one from Mother.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.189
I didn't want to bother you,
but I think he's in a deep hole.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.431
Have we ever met this Senator Fall?

45:29.520 --> 45:30.555
Not that I remember.

45:31.720 --> 45:34.359
I suppose he may be innocent.
Nothing's been proved.

45:34.640 --> 45:38.110
The one thing that has been proved
is that Harold was a fool to get involved.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.959
Don't get riled about it now.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.351
Come to bed and dream of ragtime.

46:01.880 --> 46:03.199
Is anyone still awake?

46:05.800 --> 46:06.789
Mary!

46:08.240 --> 46:09.389
What are you doing down here?

46:10.120 --> 46:11.633
I was looking for Mr Ross.

46:15.720 --> 46:19.030
Mr Ross, I wanted to thank you
For a marvellous evening.

46:19.160 --> 46:22.948
And also to ask you if you would be kind
enough to send the bill to his lordship.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.394
But that's not necessary.

46:24.480 --> 46:25.469
He wants to.

46:26.240 --> 46:29.357
He says your present was
arranging the whole thing.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.109
Of course.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.033
And now it's my turn to thank you.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.512
I've been so well looked after here.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.075
I'm glad to hear it.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.316
Well, good night.
