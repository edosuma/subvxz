[music playing]

00:45.379 --> 00:47.506
[snoring]

00:57.558 --> 00:59.351
[sniffs]
Ugh!

00:59.434 --> 01:02.271
-What is this?
-Wakey, wakey.

01:02.354 --> 01:06.149
We survived the night with no sign
of Angor Rot. Congratulations.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.987
-Thought I'd bring you some breakfast.
-[scoffs] I don't eat socks.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.906
And I don't appreciate being tied up.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.410
I asked you to protect me,
not torture me.

01:16.493 --> 01:20.539
And I said I'd keep you safe,
not comfortable.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.500
-[birds tweeting]
-Well, the sun is up.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.587
We'll have until sundown
to get me as far away as possible.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.880
Fine. Let me call the team.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.383
-[beeping]
-Trollhunter to Warhammer, you copy?

01:31.466 --> 01:34.678
[sarcastically] Oh, goodie.
The Puberty Patrol is on the case.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.847
I feel so safe.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.765
[Toby]
<i>This is Warhammer. What's up, Jimbo?</i>

01:38.849 --> 01:42.060
Do you really think your friends will
have any chance against that killer?

01:42.144 --> 01:44.062
They'll be a liability.

01:44.146 --> 01:48.191
May I remind you,
you destroyed Angor's soul.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.278
He'll be out for blood,
be it yours or theirs.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.698
<i>-Jim, hello?</i>
-Uh, yeah. Tobes, get everyone together.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.035
See what you can dig up
on finding that last Triumbric stone.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.620
<i>-The one the Gumm-Gumms stole?</i>
-Yeah.

01:59.703 --> 02:03.290
I need you guys down in Trollmarket.
I'll catch up when I can. Over and out.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.877
-[beeping]
-Smart choice. For once, you're learning.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.795
For the record,
Angor Rot destroyed his own soul.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.801
Why trust this changeling
when all he does is betray you?

02:14.885 --> 02:17.804
Because... Because,
unfortunately, I have to.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.642
-Is this all the canned food we have?
-You need more? Mm.

02:21.725 --> 02:25.228
We should chop him into little pieces
and can him right now.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.356
Did you forget the binding spell?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.608
If we hurt him, we hurt my mom.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.069
-[chuckles]
-[growls]

02:32.152 --> 02:34.529
Say you do get him out of town.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.074
What's stopping Angor Rot
from finding him?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.533
I don't know. We disguise him.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.787
Disguise? Angor is a cunning
and ruthless assassin.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.914
You think he'll be fooled
by a hat and mustache?

02:43.997 --> 02:47.626
Then I guess we fight him.
Far, far away from here.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.127
I do not like this plan.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.713
He could strike at any time,
at any place.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.632
He would have the tactical advantage.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.301
I don't know, okay?
I don't have all the answers!

02:56.385 --> 03:00.680
[sighs] Sorry, I know it's not a well
thought-out plan, but we have to leave.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.850
[robotic voice]
<i>I am Gun Robot. I am Gun Robot.</i>

03:03.934 --> 03:06.103
<i>-Pick up your phone.</i>
-Shh! It's my mom. [yawns]

03:06.812 --> 03:09.064
Hey, Mom. Uh, how are ya?
I just got up.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.401
Sorry I didn't come home, kiddo.
It's been crazy over here at the hospital.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.070
<i>Looks like my night shift</i>
<i>is turning into a weekend shift.</i>

03:15.153 --> 03:18.115
Nice arm.
Did you get that at the toy store?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.075
[yells, growls]

03:20.158 --> 03:21.159
Shh, shh!

03:21.243 --> 03:25.122
You're gonna be gone all weekend?
Oh, sucks, Mom.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.290
<i>I know, but you can</i>
<i>take care of yourself.</i>

03:27.374 --> 03:30.043
Just hunker down in the house.
Stay safe.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.629
Sure. Sure, I can hold down the fort.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.797
<i>You're a lifesaver.</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:38.218
I'll add it to my resume. Okay.
Bye, Mom. Yeah, yeah. I love you too.

03:38.301 --> 03:42.681
-She'll be out of the house all weekend?
-Yeah, the house'll be empty.

03:43.807 --> 03:50.522
[scoffs] Fine. I have rocks for brains.
Would someone tell me what's so obvious?

03:50.605 --> 03:53.316
We are gonna hold down the fort.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.320
We survived one night.
He's not going to survive the next.

03:57.404 --> 04:02.576
Right. We fight here.
Take back the tactical advantage.

04:02.659 --> 04:07.414
-An ambush! Yes, I like it.
-But we're gonna need supplies.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.223
Um, if we're looking
to research the last stone,

04:25.307 --> 04:26.767
shouldn't we be in the library?

04:26.850 --> 04:29.603
Yes. Why did you bring us
to look at Killahead Bridge?

04:29.686 --> 04:32.022
[Blinky] Before her departure,
Queen Usurna suspected

04:32.105 --> 04:34.858
a depiction of the last stone
may very well be inscribed

04:34.941 --> 04:35.984
on the bridge itself.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.029
[grunting]

04:39.112 --> 04:40.447
Ooh! Ah!

04:40.530 --> 04:43.158
The missing Eye of Gunmar.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.870
His eye is the third stone? What?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.955
Indeed.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.833
The first stone we procured
was affiliated with his birth.

04:51.917 --> 04:55.378
-The second, his first kill. This stone--
-I got it.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.176
Why, this stone commemorates...
he's vulnerable.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.260
[Claire] How do you mean?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.804
Before Gunmar took power,

05:03.887 --> 05:06.473
Gumm-Gumms were mostly
disorganized tribes of savages,

05:06.556 --> 05:09.059
taking orders from Orlagk,
the Gumm-Gumm Warlord.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.395
Gunmar betrayed him
in hopes of taking his army as his own.

05:12.479 --> 05:17.025
The battle lasted weeks.
Gunmar lost an eye. Orlagk lost his head.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.861
I fear this may be the most difficult
Triumbric stone to find.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.198
For if his dark servants worked so hard
to steal it from the Krubera,

05:23.281 --> 05:24.950
they would not hand it over so easily.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.620
[electricity crackling]

05:28.703 --> 05:30.121
Wait, the fetch!

05:30.205 --> 05:32.707
Something's escaping
from the Darklands! Look out!

05:36.753 --> 05:38.880
[grunts, moans]

05:38.964 --> 05:43.093
[gasps]
Gnome Chompsky! You're back!

05:43.176 --> 05:45.095
By Deya's grace, he survived!

05:46.513 --> 05:49.349
-[Toby] Chompsky!
-[grunting, sobbing]

05:49.432 --> 05:51.851
-Hey, bud!
-Tough little guy.

05:51.935 --> 05:56.064
Oh, I thought you were lost forever.
Hey, bud. Hey.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.651
Chompsky? The one
who was looking for Enrique?

05:59.734 --> 06:02.571
Uh-huh. Wait.
[chattering indistinctly]

06:02.654 --> 06:05.782
-Ha-ha!
-[gasps] Enrique!

06:05.865 --> 06:09.661
-You found him! Is he... Is he okay?
-Mm-hmm.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.080
Thank you for giving me that.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.540
[laughing]

06:13.623 --> 06:15.792
What did you see, my tiny fellow?

06:15.875 --> 06:19.838
-Did you see... Gunmar?
-[gasps, whimpers]

06:20.547 --> 06:22.090
-[all gasp]
-[whimpers]

06:22.173 --> 06:24.509
Gunmar did that? How did you escape?

06:25.343 --> 06:26.595
[chattering quietly]

06:27.345 --> 06:29.389
[gasps, chattering angrily]

06:29.472 --> 06:31.516
[chattering fearfully]

06:31.600 --> 06:33.018
What is he saying?

06:33.101 --> 06:36.104
-A game of pantomime!
-Panda... mine?

06:36.187 --> 06:37.397
Charades!

06:37.480 --> 06:39.065
[chattering angrily]

06:39.149 --> 06:44.154
[Blinky] You-You-You escaped the Darklands
by looking, uh... angry?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.489
By... By being constipated! Ha!

06:46.573 --> 06:47.866
No. Gunmar.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.034
[chattering angrily]

06:49.117 --> 06:52.370
-[giggles]
-[chuckles] Like panda-mine.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.706
-[chuckles]
-[chattering angrily]

06:54.789 --> 06:57.208
Oh, oh, oh! I like this.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.711
-[chattering angrily]
-[chuckling] He's... He's tickling me!

06:59.794 --> 07:02.589
You escaped Gunmar by tickling him?
No, by massaging him!

07:02.672 --> 07:03.757
A message!

07:03.840 --> 07:05.634
[chattering happily]

07:05.717 --> 07:08.303
-[grunting]
-[Blinky] Uh... Uh...

07:08.386 --> 07:10.805
To... To swipe? To purloin!

07:10.889 --> 07:12.349
[sighs]

07:12.432 --> 07:15.018
Badminton! Wait, why badminton?

07:15.101 --> 07:16.603
Sword.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.607
Gunmar wants to deliver
a message to Jim.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.901
-[giggles]
-That's why he's alive.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.694
That's how he escaped!

07:24.778 --> 07:27.697
Then I hope it's a short message
because we don't have all day.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.701
Keep that out of his line of sight.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.663
Then, we'll drive him into the garage.
Do you have the pulley?

07:34.746 --> 07:36.957
Uh-huh, it's in the basement. I'll get it.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.840
[screams] Whoa, whoa!
Why is there a hole in my basement?

07:45.924 --> 07:48.802
How else am I supposed to get around
while the sun is out?

07:48.885 --> 07:51.429
-Don't worry, it only leads to the sewers.
-Uh... Uh...

07:51.513 --> 07:54.015
Nobody knows about it but me.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.809
[Strickler]
Did you get the Lodestone?

08:03.191 --> 08:04.734
I'll take that as a "yes."

08:04.818 --> 08:06.069
[laughs]

08:06.152 --> 08:08.863
It's almost nightfall.
Come on, there's more work to be done.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.093
-[Draal blows]
-Okay, that's the last one.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.845
Now, all we do is wait.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.222
You know, I'm a bit surprised
how well we work together.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.684
You know, I'm still gonna take you down
after all this is over.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.770
[laughing]

08:40.854 --> 08:43.313
Perhaps, if we get through this,

08:43.398 --> 08:46.317
I could talk to my constituents
about the Eye of Gunmar.

08:46.401 --> 08:50.780
I assume you're still interested
in finding the last Triumbric stone?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.241
-You know where it is?
-Personally, no.

08:53.324 --> 08:57.787
But my ilk are wide and numerous.
Where there's a will, there's a way.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.165
Why would you help me kill Gunmar?

09:00.248 --> 09:01.332
[chuckles]

09:01.416 --> 09:05.086
Let's just say, I'm always looking out
for my best interests.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.338
-Oh, what a shocker.
-[blows]

09:09.174 --> 09:10.759
[gasps]

09:10.842 --> 09:13.553
What is that?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.722
-It's his eye!
-Gunmar's eye?

09:15.805 --> 09:19.267
No! Angor's!
He's been watching us! Get it!

09:19.350 --> 09:21.686
[grunts, groans]

09:21.770 --> 09:24.189
-After it! There, there!
-Catch it before it escapes!

09:24.272 --> 09:27.192
Gunmar's eye, Angor's eye.
Enough of these eyes!

09:33.823 --> 09:35.283
How long has he been watching us?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.201
-[doorknob rattling]
-[all gasp]

09:36.284 --> 09:37.619
He's here! Get in position!

09:45.919 --> 09:48.671
For the Glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.551
Hey, kiddo, you home?
Wanda messed up my schedule again.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.513
-Guess I have the day off after all.
-Mom, watch out!

09:58.932 --> 10:00.809
Whoa! Holy--
[gasps]

10:00.892 --> 10:02.936
Why is there an axe in the door?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.146
Barbara! Are you all right?

10:05.230 --> 10:09.025
I'm fine. Whoa! Holy-- How--? What is--?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.443
[chuckles nervously]

10:10.527 --> 10:14.489
W-Walt? Why are you here?
And why are you holding a crossbow?

10:14.572 --> 10:15.949
Me? Uh, yes.

10:16.032 --> 10:20.453
You see, um, there's a school project
I gave Jim and, uh...

10:20.537 --> 10:22.247
-[glass shatters]
-[groans]

10:22.330 --> 10:25.708
-Die, Angor!
-No, Draal! Get back!

10:25.792 --> 10:28.086
-[roars]
-[screams]

10:28.169 --> 10:30.088
Um, hello. Sorry.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.258
-[screaming]
-No, no, no! Mom! Mom, it's okay! He's--

10:33.341 --> 10:35.927
-[screaming]
-[screams] My eyes!

10:40.473 --> 10:42.892
-[grunts]
-[screaming]

10:42.976 --> 10:45.645
-It's okay, Mom! He's a friend!
-[screams]

10:45.728 --> 10:48.731
He <i>was</i> a friend. Now, he's out cold.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.608
[moaning]

10:50.692 --> 10:52.777
[screams]

10:55.071 --> 10:57.157
And so is she.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.450
[groaning]

10:59.534 --> 11:01.244
More water, Barbara?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.504
So, let me get this straight.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.133
There are good trolls and bad trolls...

11:15.216 --> 11:16.426
and somehow, you?

11:16.509 --> 11:21.347
If I may. There is a vast world
beneath our feet, Barbara,

11:21.431 --> 11:24.475
and your son has stirred up
a heap of trouble.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.394
-Dude!
-This is all so...

11:26.477 --> 11:28.021
-I'll give you two a moment.
-[sighs]

11:28.104 --> 11:30.648
I can't believe
this is what you've been doing.

11:30.732 --> 11:34.819
All those late nights,
getting arrested, you in the hospital...

11:34.903 --> 11:37.280
Why are you this... Trollfighter?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.032
Uh, Trollhunter.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.199
[stammering]

11:40.283 --> 11:44.329
You should be worried
about high school and girls, not this--

11:44.412 --> 11:47.457
I mean, can't you just ask
someone else to do it?

11:47.540 --> 11:51.669
I'm... I'm afraid it's a...
permanent position?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.171
They need me, Mom.

11:53.254 --> 11:57.425
I know it's hard to believe,
but I'm sorta, like, their protector.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.219
But who's gonna protect you?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.311
[growls]

12:08.394 --> 12:12.398
Hmm... Hmm...

12:12.482 --> 12:15.526
-Barbara, you do have to leave! It's--
-[cans clattering]

12:22.992 --> 12:25.787
-The basement!
-What's in the basement?
