Mm.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.308
12 years.

01:00.268 --> 01:03.772
It was five for Darryl and I.

I got partnered with him

01:05.774 --> 01:08.568
right after I got out

Yeah.

01:22.832 --> 01:26.294
[exhales] Detective Jennings

02:01.913 --> 02:02.831
Is that correct?

02:04.874 --> 02:07.460
Mr. Montanero.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.462
- I'm here to set
the record straight.

02:09.504 --> 02:10.880
- Before we get
to your statement,

02:10.922 --> 02:13.508
we will first hear
from Sergeant Bell.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.636
- For 10 years I've been saying
I did a murder I didn't do.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.181
Yes, I took a plea,
but I'm innocent.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.101
And I'm willing
to prove that now.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.519
- Mr. Montanero--

02:24.561 --> 02:26.104
I didn't kill your partner.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.940
I only said so 'cause
Eamon Murphy forced me to.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.275
Baby, no.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.818
- He promised that
if I went along with it

02:31.860 --> 02:33.528
that he'd take care
of my family.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.906
But he broke his word.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.491
We've heard enough.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.160
Look for the gun.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.619
It'll prove everything.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.539
Eamon Murphy

Are you okay? What's going on?
Talk to me.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.269

through his trial,

03:06.311 --> 03:08.396
and all these years
incarcerated,

03:08.438 --> 03:11.858
Montanero has only
said two words--

03:11.900 --> 03:13.943
I'm guilty.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.404
- Okay.
- Why now?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.073
Why is he changing
his story now?

03:18.114 --> 03:19.366
Well, why not now?

03:19.407 --> 03:21.284
It's his parole hearing.
The guy was a junkie.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.078
He's a criminal.
I mean, he confessed to it.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.788
Yeah, I know, open and shut.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.206
- His prints were on
the murder weapon.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.791
I get that.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.918
So then what?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.378
What is it? What's going on?

03:31.419 --> 03:35.256
- Ever since this began...
- Right.

03:35.298 --> 03:39.010
- I have had this feeling,
and I--

03:39.052 --> 03:40.720
I couldn't put voice to it.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.349
But now I am following my gut,
and it is telling me the truth.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.393
I gotta figure this out.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.728
- You're looking to walk
down this road on a hunch?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.064

down it with me, Elliot.

Hey, Mike.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.344
Ayanna.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.137
Been a while, huh?

05:04.179 --> 05:05.764
Least 10 years.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.307
Something I can help you with?

05:07.349 --> 05:09.976
Octavio Montanero.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.353
What about him?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.645
- Well, I went to
his parole hearing.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.647
I was surprised
I didn't see you there.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.400
[chuckles] Guy killed a cop.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.652
Mother Teresa could show up
to vouch for him,

05:19.694 --> 05:21.780
he isn't getting out.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.076
- When you pulled the slug
out of Octavio's gun

05:26.117 --> 05:28.036
and they ran it
through ballistics,

05:28.078 --> 05:30.997
it came back inconclusive.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.542
So it never matched the slug
that they took out of Darryl.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.463
Was that in the report?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.173
It's been so long
I'd have to check.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.676
I already did.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.011
You checked the report? When?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.847
Before I got here.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.349
What's this about right now?

05:49.391 --> 05:53.019
- Why were you so sure that
that was the murder weapon?

05:53.061 --> 05:56.022
- Octavio confessed,
took the plea.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.483
- You never even
interviewed Eamon Murphy.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.319
- You questioning
my investigation right now?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.029
On a case I closed?

06:03.071 --> 06:05.865
- I'm just trying
to tie up some loose ends.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.577
- You got a problem with how
I ran things, Ayanna?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.705
<i>[tense music]</i>

06:11.746 --> 06:14.457
You should have
taken your own shot.

<i>* *</i>

06:19.504 --> 06:21.089
[gunshot]

06:32.183 --> 06:34.561
- Thanks for doing this
on such short notice.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.230
- You'll let Jet know
I helped out?

06:37.272 --> 06:40.942
Yeah, she sends her regards.

06:40.984 --> 06:45.655
- Uh, so this is a side-by-side
comparison of the bullet taken

06:45.697 --> 06:47.240
from the body
of Darryl Jennings

06:47.282 --> 06:49.993
and the bullet that I just
fired from Octavio's gun.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.911
The contour variations
of the lines

06:51.953 --> 06:54.080
should be identical
if they were fired

06:54.122 --> 06:55.165
from the same weapon.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.875
And they're not.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.086
- They're close, but not enough
to be a solid match.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.464
- So there's a possibility
that this is not the slug

07:02.505 --> 07:03.548
that killed my partner.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.924
It's inconclusive.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.677
- So it could have been
another weapon.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.430
- Didn't he confess, though,
take a plea?

07:10.472 --> 07:11.723
Do me a favor.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.892
Don't tell anybody
about this, okay?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.643
- I'm not even sure
what I'd say.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.104
Even better. Thanks.

Did you kill my partner?

07:49.052 --> 07:49.928
No.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.763
Then why did you say you did?

07:51.805 --> 07:55.308
- I told you why
at the hearing.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.227
Heh.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.520
What, you believe in me now?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.980
Oh, I don't believe anything.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.982
I'm here because I wanna
look you in the eye

08:03.024 --> 08:05.777
and hear what you have to say.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.530
I didn't shoot your partner.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.200
Eamon Murphy did.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.576
Why are you so sure?

08:13.618 --> 08:15.286
I was there.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.496
I saw the whole thing.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.872
Then why did you confess?

08:17.914 --> 08:21.167
- Because I was a junkie
at the time.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.877
A total degenerate.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.966
But I had a kid,
a wife who loved me

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
but couldn't have me around
when I was using.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.678
When Murphy said that
he'd send them money

08:31.720 --> 08:34.681
if I took the rap, I just--

08:34.723 --> 08:37.976
I thought it was my shot
at redemption.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.769
But then the money
stopped coming.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.023
The gun they found on you?

08:43.064 --> 08:46.901
- It was mine,
but Eamon used his own.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.612
It was this--
what do you call it?

08:49.654 --> 08:52.991
A--a pen gun.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.703
- He used a pen gun
to kill Darryl?

08:56.745 --> 08:59.914
- He took this ring
off his finger.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.500
Like, a police academy ring,
I think it was.

09:02.542 --> 09:09.591
<i>* *</i>

09:10.091 --> 09:12.552
- Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.805
You know who this is?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.724
- You have the option
to remain anonymous.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.810
But you know who this is.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.437
Yes, Mr. Murphy.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.023
- It's been a few years
since my last confession.

09:25.065 --> 09:29.903
If I'm being honest, guilt is
not something I struggle with.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.990
But recently, I thought
about killing a priest.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.078
That's a very serious sin.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.997
- So is stealing
from the offerings.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.416
At least that's what
I heard from a cousin of mine

09:43.458 --> 09:44.918
who attends mass here.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.587
- I don't know why
he would have said that.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.172
Are you lying to me?

09:51.424 --> 09:54.344
Because bearing false witness,

09:54.386 --> 09:58.848
that sin is worse
than stealing in my eyes.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.267
And I don't take absolution.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.521
There are hardworking families
in this neighborhood,

10:04.562 --> 10:08.566
and they come here
and give what little they have

10:08.608 --> 10:11.152
to keep this church open.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.823
So if I hear anything
about this happening again,

10:14.864 --> 10:18.660
we won't be meeting
in this silly little box.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.290
Is that clear?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.334
Yes.

on the parole board.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.771
He texted earlier,
saying Octavio went

10:46.813 --> 10:48.273

10:48.314 --> 10:50.650
Now he's saying
he mentioned you by name,

10:50.692 --> 10:52.652
blamed you for the murder.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.571
Who else was at the meeting?

10:54.612 --> 10:58.616
- His wife and some cop
who was gonna read a statement.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.035
What cop?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.288
Signed in as Ayanna Bell.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.125
What, you know her?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.089

coming in, last thing we need

11:13.131 --> 11:15.675
is this kind of attention.

- My notes.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.194
Your notes?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.487
- Darryl's murder
investigation,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.322
and I have two more boxes
in my closet at home.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.865
- You shadowed
the investigation.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.700
I met with Octavio today.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.494
He saw Eamon kill Darryl.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.412
He even knew about
the police academy ring.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.081
- You met with Octavio
earlier today?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.040
I did.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.708
All those failed
investigations,

11:48.750 --> 11:49.793
thing of the past.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.169
We got Octavio.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.004
- We're gonna get Murphy.
- No, we're not.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.048
- No, Octavio is gonna
give me a statement

11:55.090 --> 11:56.716
that places Murphy
as the shooter.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.760
Octavio is dead.

11:59.844 --> 12:00.929
What?

12:00.970 --> 12:01.888
- They couldn't
get ahold of you.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.223
The warden called me.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.769
Octavio was murdered tonight.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.604
They found his body
outside the showers.

12:09.646 --> 12:16.361
<i>* *</i>

12:21.533 --> 12:21.950
.

12:21.991 --> 12:22.575
Murphy's a nonstarter.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.537
Gambling, drugs, homicide.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.497
This is a clear-cut OCCB case.

12:27.539 --> 12:31.751
- No, it's a cold case
involving your former partner.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.086
Mike Graham called me.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.504
We both see what
you're up to here.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.172
I have a solid tip.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.550
- From a dead guy
on a closed case that,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.343
if it were to be reopened,
would make the DA

12:40.385 --> 12:42.012
and the NYPD look like we
don't know what we're doing.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.723
- And how does it look
if Murphy was the killer

12:44.764 --> 12:46.599
and we let him walk free?

12:46.641 --> 12:50.311
Look, Narcotics, DEA, FBI,

12:50.353 --> 12:53.023
they all took shots at Murphy
and came up empty.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.983
We're not throwing
more good money after bad.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.193
- It's not about money.
It's about support.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.820
- And I'd be lying
if I said you have mine.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.114
- Oh, lying like you did about
your football career,

13:01.156 --> 13:03.992
the one you need those
prescription pills for?

13:04.034 --> 13:06.911
<i>[tense music]</i>

13:06.953 --> 13:09.497
<i>* *</i>

13:09.539 --> 13:12.917
- You need to be really, really
careful right now, Ayanna.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.045
About what?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.589
Going after the truth
or exposing you?

13:21.092 --> 13:24.012
I will get Murphy,
and when I do,

13:24.054 --> 13:28.516
you'll be the deputy inspector
who did what no one else could.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.393
And then you'll thank me.

13:30.435 --> 13:36.858
<i>* *</i>

13:36.900 --> 13:39.110
- You are looking
at Eamon Murphy,

13:39.152 --> 13:40.820
born in Sligo, Ireland,

13:40.862 --> 13:42.697
came to New York
in the early '80s.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.908
Found his way into the
Cement Workers Union,

13:44.949 --> 13:47.243
where he got tired
of hard labor

13:47.285 --> 13:50.413
and paying taxes,
so he began to run numbers

13:50.455 --> 13:53.500
until he found the Westies,
in which he became an enforcer.

13:53.541 --> 13:57.212
Since then, he has basically
shot, stabbed, and stolen

13:57.253 --> 13:58.963
his way up to being a boss.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.215
- He runs his
criminal operation

14:00.256 --> 14:02.008
out of local bars now,

14:02.050 --> 14:04.386
using them as drop-offs
for drugs, gambling,

14:04.427 --> 14:05.929
and the occasional homicide.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.722
- Smart, keeps him
one step removed.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.890
He's upped his game,

14:08.932 --> 14:10.642
running a more
sophisticated operation.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.727
Think Westies 2.0.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.230
But bigger the money,
bigger the body count.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.274
- His number two is this man,
Seamus O'Meara.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.485
He runs Murphy's crew
of about 40.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.029
- So our job is
to get in with the crew.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.198
Start at the bottom,
try and turn someone

14:25.240 --> 14:26.533
on our way up the ladder.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.702
- So we're all gonna try
to infiltrate at once?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.370
- The DEA sent two
of their undercovers

14:30.412 --> 14:32.956
into Murphy's operation
in 2016.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.792
They got made,
almost cut to pieces.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.086
The heat came down,
but no charges were ever filed,

14:38.128 --> 14:40.255
so Murphy is extra cautious.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.756
- So what are we picking
this up for if the Feds

14:41.798 --> 14:43.258
already had their crack?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.718
Won't they just sweep in
and take the credit

14:44.759 --> 14:45.802
if we do get somewhere?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.303
We'll worry about that later.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.597
Right now,
Murphy is my problem to solve.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.559
<i>* *</i>

14:52.600 --> 14:54.728
- So what's our plan
if no one else has ever

14:54.769 --> 14:56.021
had any luck getting inside?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.148
- We're not gonna have
to get inside with him.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.067
Murphy's gonna wanna
get inside with us.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.322
So you wanna use my bar.

15:06.364 --> 15:09.784
I thought the NYPD seized it
once my father started talking.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.785
Isn't it yours already?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.495
It is.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.123
Well, we just feel that, um, in
order to make the cover work,

15:15.165 --> 15:17.500
we'd appreciate
your cooperation.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.294
- You know, I don't know
if you remember this,

15:19.336 --> 15:22.297
but, uh, I'm not supposed
to leave the apartment.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.548
Without supervision.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.592
- Eamon Murphy
does a lot of business

15:25.633 --> 15:27.010
in the bars in Queens.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.929
Yours is right in the middle
of his turf.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.308
We reopen, send out
the invitation to do business.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.643
- He'll show up.
- What makes you so sure?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.854
- Because you're gonna
make it so attractive

15:37.896 --> 15:41.149
he won't be able to say no.

15:41.191 --> 15:45.695
<i>* *</i>

15:45.737 --> 15:46.988
- You know,
some of those guys used

15:47.030 --> 15:49.908
to come in when we were open.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.493
They left a pretty huge tab.

15:51.534 --> 15:55.538
- The NYPD will take care
of all the expenses.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.707
- What I meant was,
those guys are dangerous.

15:57.749 --> 16:01.127
- Well, we'll make sure not
to tell them if you don't.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.840
- How much time off is the DA
offering for my cooperation?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.718
- Depends on how much we
tell them you're cooperating.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.725
Welcome to Hyperium.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.896
You guys take a look around.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.273
We need to change that name.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.025
- Nice spot.
- Nice?

16:24.067 --> 16:25.819
This was <i>the</i>spot
when I ran it.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.612
If you like $40 cocktails.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.406
- How long will it take
to wire this place?

16:29.447 --> 16:30.990
At least a week, maybe more.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.742
- We already have cameras
in here.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.993
We need those hidden.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.662
We want the Murphy crew
to feel comfortable.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.580
More comfortable they are,
the more they talk.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.874
- What you actually need
are a couple obvious cameras

16:39.916 --> 16:42.127
so your clientele
can feel like they see you,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.045
and then you place
the hidden ones places

16:44.087 --> 16:46.715
like there, there, there.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.633
And, uh, follow me.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.972
In here is where
we watch the show.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.057
My father was obsessed
with recording everything,

16:56.099 --> 16:57.350
as you already know.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.352
We wired up
all our clubs like this.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.271
What's this room here?

17:01.312 --> 17:04.107
- That is why you came
to me in the first place.

17:06.276 --> 17:10.405
- Damn, you really
had your hand in everything.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.532
- We're gonna have to staff it
with it our guys--

17:12.574 --> 17:15.035
stickmen, dealers,
anyone with experience.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.578
- The official title
is croupier.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.006

running a table at Foxwoods.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.604
- Where are we
with making contact?

17:42.645 --> 17:45.607
- My CI's got direct access
inside Murphy's crew.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.525
We're good.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.486

I like that about him,

21:32.208 --> 21:38.423
Now, Octavio, your beloved,
he made a promise to be loyal,

21:42.052 --> 21:43.094
You stopped paying.

about loyalty,

21:45.347 --> 21:47.098
it's supposed to be
unconditional.

21:47.140 --> 21:52.020
For example, say I wanted
Jack here to attack.

Yeah, come on in.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.374
- Look, I'm sorry
to drop in like this.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.584
I just wanted to make sure
that our conversation

24:19.626 --> 24:20.710
would be in private.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.337
It's in private.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.547
Have a seat.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.007
You work for the DA's Office?

24:26.049 --> 24:27.384
Yeah.

24:27.425 --> 24:28.927
I'm an investigator
specializing in white collar

24:28.968 --> 24:31.012
- and organized crime.
- Uh-huh.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.264
- I had a lot of crossover
with your unit in the past,

24:33.306 --> 24:35.183
and now with Eamon Murphy.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.436
We're also looking
into Octavio Montanero's death.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.979
- Who says
we're looking at Murphy?

24:40.021 --> 24:43.191
- Well, your deputy inspector
looped us in.

24:43.233 --> 24:47.153
- Well, I--I don't discuss
ongoing investigations, so.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.989
- Well, maybe I can
tell you what I know.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.366
Okay.

24:51.408 --> 24:53.868
- Ever since I started
working with the DA,

24:53.910 --> 24:55.829
Eamon Murphy's been
at the top of our list.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.706
But any time
anybody gets close,

24:57.747 --> 24:59.374
he manages to skate away.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.585
Now, Murphy's a smart guy,
but after 30 years

25:02.627 --> 25:04.254
of breaking the law, I mean,

25:04.295 --> 25:05.714
no one gets that lucky
all the time.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.048
- So you think
he's got protection.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.508
Yeah.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.553
- From?
- Oh, NYPD. Feds.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.055
City Hall. Maybe all three.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.890
- How long you been
in the Investigator's Office?

25:15.932 --> 25:17.726
- Two years.
- Uh-huh. And before that?

25:17.767 --> 25:20.020
- Louisiana.
Homicide detective.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.563
Homicide, huh?

25:21.604 --> 25:23.481
Got tired of that grind.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.899
Needed a change.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.067
- So you thought you'd
come up here

25:26.109 --> 25:29.362
and complicate my life
and my job?

25:29.404 --> 25:31.322
- I know what you did
with the Brotherhood.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.366
And Captain Benson
speaks very highly of you,

25:33.408 --> 25:37.245
so I knew you were someone
I could trust.

25:37.287 --> 25:38.913
Hmm.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.665
You know Captain Benson?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.292
- Uh-huh.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.002
Okay.

25:44.044 --> 25:47.839
Well, I'm gonna have to
tell my sergeant about this.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.174
- Whatever makes you
comfortable.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.260
I was hoping we could
all keep this between us

25:52.302 --> 25:53.345
for the time being.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.929
- Okay.
- Uh.

Oh, that famous banana bread.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.868
Thank you.

26:16.910 --> 26:21.164

those hearings is hard.

26:21.206 --> 26:26.461
And I so appreciate you always
advocating for me and Darryl.

26:32.801 --> 26:36.179

the other day at the hearing.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.598
I don't wanna bring it up
over the phone, so,

26:38.640 --> 26:40.183
you know, thank you
for coming down.

26:43.186 --> 26:46.231
[sighs] New evidence
has been brought to light

26:46.272 --> 26:49.984
that puts Octavio's
confession in doubt.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.736
What do you mean in doubt?

26:53.446 --> 26:56.866
- Another man might be
responsible for Darryl's death.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.328
I'm just now getting into it.

27:00.370 --> 27:05.125
But from what I've seen
so far, it's very compelling.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.210
- So I just wanted you to know--
- Stop.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.670
Look, I know this is a shock.

27:08.712 --> 27:14.676
- Maybe you never made
your peace with it, but I have.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.803
So don't drag me
into your mess now.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.680
I have to do this.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.266
We have to, for Darryl.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.143
- Don't you dare say
this is about Darryl.

Congratulations.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.677
It looks like
you had a fun night.

34:53.718 --> 34:55.220
- It's a great room
you're running here.

- Oh, good.
I'll make sure Ricky knows.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.474
Yeah, you do that.

34:59.516 --> 35:00.600
I'll be seeing you again.

Yeah, I think you're right.

You all right?

37:18.571 --> 37:21.199
- I should have pursued Murphy

37:21.241 --> 37:23.827
- You weren't in charge
of the investigation.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.662
- Yeah, but I knew
he and his operation

37:25.704 --> 37:27.956

into the neighborhood.

37:27.997 --> 37:32.711
