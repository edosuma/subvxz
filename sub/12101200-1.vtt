02:06.217 --> 02:07.660
- You're so bad at checkers.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.330
You're so bad.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.422
You suck at checkers.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.255
You suck.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.298
Whoa.

02:14.385 --> 02:15.679
Chill, man.

02:15.679 --> 02:16.512
You suck.

02:19.388 --> 02:20.236
- Fuck.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.180
I'm disappointed
what you did to Roger.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.888
- Yeah well, he's a taunter.

02:27.888 --> 02:28.721
You should try playing him

02:28.721 --> 02:30.960
and maybe you wouldn't be so surprised.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.410
- I'm not the one in therapy.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.470
Jack, I may be able to get you out of here

02:38.470 --> 02:40.770
under my supervision, but you're
gonna have to work harder.

02:40.770 --> 02:42.370
- I would do anything.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.740
I bet I can get my old job back.

02:44.740 --> 02:45.573
- That would help.

02:45.573 --> 02:47.883
I will work as
hard as you need me to.

02:51.350 --> 02:52.183
- Jack.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.350
Your mother's not doing well.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.053
It's another reason you need
to get your life together.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.090
- You have my word.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.003
- Hey.

03:15.670 --> 03:17.070
How are your sessions going?

03:18.480 --> 03:19.460
- They suck.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.180
I'm not getting anything out of them.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.380
Why don't you just release me

03:22.380 --> 03:25.090
and let me get out of here full time?

03:25.090 --> 03:28.120
- Release somebody with
your violent history?

03:28.120 --> 03:31.180
- I stabbed one bitch in one bar one time.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.770
- It was your best friend.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.290
- Well, she shouldn't have
been checking out my man.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.790
- I'm disappointed you
think that's a good reason.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.720
Remember when you were telling me

03:40.720 --> 03:43.940
during one of our sessions
about your sexual dreams.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.500
You were being choked.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.333
- Those weren't dreams.

03:46.333 --> 03:47.970
They were the real deal.

03:47.970 --> 03:49.960
- I have to help somebody
with their violent end

03:49.960 --> 03:53.270
and anger issues and I was hoping

03:53.270 --> 03:56.800
maybe you would become my
assistant in a small capacity

03:56.800 --> 03:58.710
and of course only if you want to.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.640
- I wouldn't have to come back here?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.130
- Not unless you went off the reservation,

04:04.130 --> 04:06.230
then I'd have to bring you here full time.

04:08.860 --> 04:09.960
- I'll think about it.

04:11.830 --> 04:12.663
- Thank you.

04:25.782 --> 04:27.304
- Marnie.

04:27.304 --> 04:28.646
Marnie.

04:28.646 --> 04:29.479
One more.

04:29.479 --> 04:30.580
- Jack, I'm not doing this.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.060
Just one more, okay?

04:32.060 --> 04:32.893
Just get it for me.

04:32.893 --> 04:33.726
- You're cut off.

04:33.726 --> 04:34.559
Go home.

04:34.559 --> 04:35.392
- Just one more, Marnie.

04:35.392 --> 04:36.510
- You're hurting me.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.423
Go home now.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.250
- Hey buddy, get lost.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.533
That's my beer.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.140
Do you believe this guy?

04:52.973 --> 04:54.174
Oh.

05:02.740 --> 05:03.573
- Jack, wait a second.

05:03.573 --> 05:04.667
I just bailed you out.
- No, I gotta go home.

05:04.667 --> 05:05.500
Go to sleep.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.333
I'll call you tomorrow.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.166
- Not to mention I drove your van here

05:07.166 --> 05:08.740
without a driver's license.

05:08.740 --> 05:09.737
- Then get one.

05:09.737 --> 05:10.970
- You know why I won't.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.443
- Right because you got
broadsided years ago.

05:12.443 --> 05:13.590
It fucked up your leg.

05:13.590 --> 05:14.618
You're a doctor of psychology.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.080
- What are you doing getting bar fights?

05:16.080 --> 05:16.913
- Just figure it out.

05:16.913 --> 05:17.746
- We've been working so hard in therapy.

05:17.746 --> 05:19.500
- Maybe it's not working, okay.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.003
Do I look better?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.700
- Come to my office tomorrow
at two o'clock, okay.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.350
I have a special session for you.

05:26.909 --> 05:27.742
- Jesus.

05:27.742 --> 05:29.282
- Two o'clock, Jack, okay.

05:48.950 --> 05:49.950
- What's this about?

05:50.837 --> 05:52.980
- A customer needs that done by tonight.

05:54.747 --> 05:57.840
- I have too many parts to change.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.810
I got you your job back.

05:59.810 --> 06:00.643
You get it done.

06:00.643 --> 06:03.870
- What so, I owe you something now?

06:03.870 --> 06:05.810
I can walk away at any time.

06:05.810 --> 06:08.187
- Like how you walked away
from our relationship?

06:08.187 --> 06:09.750
- Why do you always bring that up?

06:09.750 --> 06:12.500
- My dad's taking a risk
letting you work here.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.330
You quit and the doctor's gonna send you

06:14.330 --> 06:16.220
right back to the loony bin.

06:16.220 --> 06:17.640
No one's gonna hire you.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.707
- You know what?

06:19.707 --> 06:20.813
You don't worry about it.

06:20.813 --> 06:21.646
I'll fix it.

06:21.646 --> 06:23.010
- You're crazy.

06:23.010 --> 06:25.600
Hey Jack, what are you doing?

06:25.600 --> 06:27.273
What are you two arguing about?

06:28.650 --> 06:30.391
It's nothing, Melvin, okay.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.010
It's nothing.

06:32.010 --> 06:33.300
- My business will be nothing

06:33.300 --> 06:35.440
if you two don't get
along and get to work.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.950
I was hoping when I brought you back

06:38.950 --> 06:40.610
that you two would get back together.

06:40.610 --> 06:41.500
- Dad, stop it.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.910
Jack doesn't wanna hear that.

06:43.910 --> 06:47.060
- Look, you spend time in an
institution it changes you.

06:47.060 --> 06:47.893
Okay?

06:49.090 --> 06:49.994
- No crap.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.244
Throwing parts.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.324
- I'm surprised you're here, Melvin.

06:55.324 --> 06:56.157
How you doing?

06:56.157 --> 06:57.170
You feeling all right?

06:57.170 --> 06:58.003
- Not good.

06:59.010 --> 07:01.770
It's better I come to work
than sit home waiting to die.

07:01.770 --> 07:03.540
- Dad, don't talk like that.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.723
You're not gonna die.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.340
- Don't worry 'bout me.

07:07.340 --> 07:10.783
Please, you two get along
so this business survives.

07:12.445 --> 07:14.890
- Let me help you, okay.

07:19.433 --> 07:20.266
Look, Pearl.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.066
I'm sorry.

07:25.066 --> 07:25.899
I'm sorry.

07:27.390 --> 07:28.940
Can you cover me this afternoon?

07:28.940 --> 07:31.070
I have this experimental
session with my doc.

07:31.070 --> 07:32.020
I have to be there.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.513
- Sure.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.603
Hope it goes well.

07:38.889 --> 07:39.722
- Thank you.

07:39.722 --> 07:41.055
Again I'm sorry.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.300
So what am I supposed to do?

07:49.300 --> 07:52.030
I'm supposed to stand
here and stare into space?

07:52.030 --> 07:56.610
- Just relax and remember this
is an experimental exercise.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.443
Okay?

07:57.443 --> 07:59.590
So close your eyes and take a deep breath.

07:59.590 --> 08:01.200
Somebody's going to
approach you from behind

08:01.200 --> 08:03.100
and I want you to respond accordingly.

08:07.731 --> 08:08.605
- Don't you touch that.

08:08.605 --> 08:09.438
Don't fucking touch.

08:25.241 --> 08:26.074
Die.

08:27.310 --> 08:28.563
- Thank you, Bonnie.

08:29.900 --> 08:30.733
Jack.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.840
We have some work to do.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.373
You okay?

09:24.373 --> 09:25.710
- No.

09:25.710 --> 09:27.510
I was looking for Bonnie to.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.203
She's on a break right now.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.190
- Look, Doc, this therapy is not working.

09:33.190 --> 09:34.673
- Well, you have to give a little time.

09:34.673 --> 09:37.083
- I still carry this stupid wire.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.293
You don't have to.

09:40.270 --> 09:41.370
- Can't let it go.

09:41.370 --> 09:45.100
Every time I just I see my
father dying in front of me

09:45.100 --> 09:48.969
and my mother being destroyed by it.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.082
- Dad, wait.

09:50.082 --> 09:51.570
You forgot your thermos.

10:11.190 --> 10:14.760
- Jack, you're gonna have to let it go.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.593
Okay?

10:15.593 --> 10:18.030
I mean, we can't change the past.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.130
And you've worked so hard to become

10:19.130 --> 10:20.210
an electrician like your father,

10:20.210 --> 10:21.510
but maybe that wire's becoming

10:21.510 --> 10:23.400
a detriment to your progression.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.590
- I'm not ready to give it up.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.183
- And I'm not asking you to.

10:27.930 --> 10:29.010
We'll retrain your behavior

10:29.010 --> 10:32.518
and once the anger is
gone, so to the wire.

10:32.518 --> 10:34.090
- You really believe that?

10:34.090 --> 10:36.403
- I do because I believe in you.

10:38.950 --> 10:41.560
- Suppose I should be grateful
to you for not killing me.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.600
You slapped me.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.433
- What else was I supposed to do?

10:43.433 --> 10:45.110
You were trying to strangle me.

10:45.110 --> 10:45.943
- Okay.

10:47.190 --> 10:48.023
- It's okay.

10:48.023 --> 10:48.856
Just let him go.

11:14.224 --> 11:15.820
Hands up, motherfucker.

11:15.820 --> 11:16.653
Keep 'em up.

11:16.653 --> 11:18.403
Give me the fucking money now.

11:21.537 --> 11:23.648
- Do you know who the
fuck you're messing with?

11:23.648 --> 11:24.830
- I don't give a fuck.

11:24.830 --> 11:26.623
Give me the fucking money now.

11:28.849 --> 11:30.073
Fucking asshole.

11:32.783 --> 11:33.616
- Plates.

11:33.616 --> 11:34.933
Plates, write down his number.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.170
- You okay?

11:42.170 --> 11:43.003
- Yeah.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.010
I spoke to Miss Griffin over a week ago.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.840
I'm wondering what's
delaying that grant check.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.590
- Sure she'll get back to you soon.

11:54.050 --> 11:54.903
Where's mine?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.320
- You two should talk about
what happened rationally.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.153
Okay?

12:00.153 --> 12:00.986
I'll be back later.

12:07.330 --> 12:08.580
- Thanks for crushing it.

12:09.982 --> 12:12.373
Peselowe's broke so he
can't buy a new one.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.720
- I don't need it anymore.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.120
I'm fine.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.830
- We both hoped that this exercise

12:17.830 --> 12:19.970
would prove you could control your anger.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.250
- I guess you were wrong.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.750
I just tried to choke you out.

12:24.770 --> 12:28.660
- These aggression control
training works on milder cases.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.770
You're screwed up, but I'll put you right.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.700
- Wow, I guess you've got a new line

12:33.700 --> 12:35.720
of work in psychology, huh?

12:35.720 --> 12:37.830
- Well I know how to get things done.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.250
I'll get rid of your hot button.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.780
- Yeah, I guess if
anybody has a hot temper,

12:40.780 --> 12:42.470
you can just zap 'em.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.920
Whatever it takes.

12:47.756 --> 12:48.589
- Do you think the Doc just thinks

12:48.589 --> 12:51.130
of me as some lab experiment?

12:51.130 --> 12:52.573
- His methods are extreme,

12:53.720 --> 12:58.253
but great reward requires great risk.

13:03.090 --> 13:04.463
Maybe I overreacted.

13:07.410 --> 13:09.460
I wouldn't be here if I didn't trust you.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.350
I'm on your side.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.776
- You're bad news.

14:01.027 --> 14:01.860
- Hey.

14:01.860 --> 14:02.797
What do we got?

14:02.797 --> 14:03.630
- Well.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.670
Don't worry, Charles.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.570
Chief Nelson and I will find this guy.

14:10.115 --> 14:10.948
- The hell did he take?

14:10.948 --> 14:12.260
There's nothing in this dive.

14:13.210 --> 14:14.043
- Charles had the presence of mind

14:14.043 --> 14:16.310
to get the license plate number.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.750
Guy wore a ragged green Army jacket.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.789
- Yeah, with a sergeant's stripe
and a hell on wheels patch.

14:21.789 --> 14:23.840
- Had to be a drug addict.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.517
Attack you with a gun and
get only how much, Charles?

14:25.517 --> 14:26.467
- $200.

14:26.467 --> 14:27.300
- $200.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.913
That's not a whole lot of money.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.210
Devlin.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.840
Was I not clear when I said I don't want

14:34.840 --> 14:37.200
these illegal machines in my town?

14:37.200 --> 14:38.100
- Come on, Chief.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.323
You know everybody has 'em.

14:39.323 --> 14:40.960
I mean, even the firehouse has one.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.800
We're just trying to keep
local businesses afloat.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.550
- Oh, hey, then let's put
one up in the precinct, huh?

14:47.669 --> 14:48.560
We don't have the big budgets

14:48.560 --> 14:50.070
that these large corporate cities have,

14:50.070 --> 14:51.520
but don't you worry, Charles,

14:51.520 --> 14:54.290
we're gonna get your lousy 200 bucks back.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.547
What a racket.

15:02.315 --> 15:03.148
- $200.

15:04.261 --> 15:05.577
That's funny.

15:05.577 --> 15:08.170
I thought this place made
a lot more money than that.

15:26.395 --> 15:29.138
- All right, this matches.

15:29.138 --> 15:31.055
- It's an oven in here.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.240
Brenner.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.630
Jack Brenner.

15:35.630 --> 15:36.930
Yeah?

15:36.930 --> 15:39.060
- You're under arrest for armed robbery

15:39.060 --> 15:40.130
at the Hideaway Tavern.

15:40.130 --> 15:40.963
- What?

15:40.963 --> 15:41.900
- What's going on?

15:41.900 --> 15:43.389
Hey, hey,
don't fucking touch her.

15:43.389 --> 15:44.222
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:44.222 --> 15:45.420
- What kind of cop are you, huh?

15:45.420 --> 15:47.576
- The kind that does what
he likes when he likes.

15:47.576 --> 15:49.037
- Do you have a warrant?

15:49.037 --> 15:50.543
- Warrant for your arrest.

15:51.590 --> 15:52.490
Where's the gun?

15:52.490 --> 15:53.470
- I don't have one.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.133
Search all you want.

15:55.133 --> 15:55.966
- That's all right.

15:55.966 --> 15:56.810
We got a search warrant, too.

15:56.810 --> 15:58.100
- It's a shame your anger issues

15:58.100 --> 16:00.110
have escalated to assault and robbery.

16:00.110 --> 16:00.943
Come on.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.100
- Fuck you.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.160
You're going down, Brenner.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.300
- Everything's gonna be fine, Jack.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.483
I'll call your lawyer.

16:11.530 --> 16:14.790
- He's Dr. Peselowe's latest pet project.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.480
Even gives Bonnie the creeps.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.313
- Bonnie Lang?

16:18.313 --> 16:19.146
Charles girlfriend?

16:21.130 --> 16:21.963
- It's okay.

16:25.253 --> 16:26.730
- Look what we found in your car.

16:26.730 --> 16:27.563
Go 'head, try it on.

16:27.563 --> 16:29.380
- You gonna do something about this?

16:29.380 --> 16:31.963
- Wally, you do not have
a case against my client.

16:31.963 --> 16:35.400
Counselor,
explain some things to me.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.770
Mask, the car, the plates, the clothes.

16:38.770 --> 16:41.020
All witnessed during the robbery.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.380
Explain those things to me

16:42.380 --> 16:44.790
and it'll make it so much easier.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.340
- Your client's under
psychiatric treatment, right?

16:48.755 --> 16:49.870
Bit of a loose canon, are we?

16:49.870 --> 16:51.230
- Watch what you say about my client.

16:51.230 --> 16:53.520
- Look, I'm fucking innocent.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.420
- You may have been born that way,

16:54.420 --> 16:55.440
but you didn't stay that way.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.990
You needed money so you took it.

16:56.990 --> 16:58.800
- I'd be insane to wear my jacket

16:58.800 --> 17:00.130
and drive my car to rob a place.

17:00.130 --> 17:01.450
- Newsflash, you are insane.

17:01.450 --> 17:02.690
Bonnie Lang said so.

17:02.690 --> 17:03.598
- Bullshit.

17:03.598 --> 17:04.431
You know what?

17:04.431 --> 17:05.264
I'm out of here.
- No, you're not.

17:05.264 --> 17:06.097
We're not done with you.

17:06.097 --> 17:06.930
Sit down.

17:06.930 --> 17:09.533
- That's police brutality on my client.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.610
- You're watching too much TV.

17:13.610 --> 17:14.810
You gotta get out more.

17:14.810 --> 17:16.210
Police brutality.

17:16.210 --> 17:17.490
- No worries.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.781
We'll solve it one way or the other.

17:19.781 --> 17:20.981
- What, you don't knock?

17:25.100 --> 17:26.160
You're free to go.

17:26.160 --> 17:26.993
Made bail.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.700
- Now you boys have a very shaky case.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.890
Dr. Peselowe has always been Jack's alibi

17:35.890 --> 17:38.160
and you better keep your
hands off my client or.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.270
- Or what?

17:39.270 --> 17:42.470
- Or I'll sue you and
bankrupt this dive town.

17:42.470 --> 17:43.303
- Good luck with that.

17:43.303 --> 17:44.136
Go 'head.

17:44.136 --> 17:45.340
Might make about 100 bucks.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.237
- Y'all come back now, you hear?

17:48.940 --> 17:50.627
- Come on, let's get on this.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.000
Thanks for bailing me out again.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.610
I know you put it all on the line.

17:59.610 --> 18:02.120
- Yeah, just don't do anything foolish.

18:02.120 --> 18:02.953
- I'm innocent.

18:02.953 --> 18:03.940
You have nothing to worry about.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.990
- I've never been much of a worrier.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.340
Besides, I think the police

18:07.340 --> 18:08.810
will find the true culprit quickly.

18:08.810 --> 18:11.700
- The only thing the cops do
quickly is jump to conclusions.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.160
I don't trust them to do a damn thing.

18:13.160 --> 18:13.993
- Patience, okay.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.512
Can they just do their job?

18:21.730 --> 18:22.920
- Oh at least let me drive you home.

18:22.920 --> 18:23.980
You don't have to take cab.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.090
- It's nonsense.

18:25.090 --> 18:27.190
Okay, can you just fix the
electrical outlet in my office

18:27.190 --> 18:29.390
like I've asked you to
do and we'll be even.

18:33.340 --> 18:34.720
- Hey.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.623
Yeah, I need to talk to you anyway.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.830
All right.

18:38.830 --> 18:39.801
Yeah, I'll just come.

18:39.801 --> 18:40.892
Bye.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.340
- I heard about your
trouble with the police.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.890
Thought we should talk.

19:03.890 --> 19:06.183
- So you can give them
more information about me?

19:07.820 --> 19:10.140
- Save your anger for those who hurt you.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.290
I'm trying to help you.

19:12.470 --> 19:13.830
Face facts.

19:13.830 --> 19:15.123
You make a great suspect.

19:22.291 --> 19:26.000
That's Cathy Moffitt from out of the past.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.510
My favorite onscreen hero.

19:28.510 --> 19:29.343
Nerves of steel.

19:29.343 --> 19:32.350
Didn't hesitate to shoot
any man who got in her way.

19:32.350 --> 19:33.790
- Is that normal?

19:33.790 --> 19:34.770
Normal's overrated.

19:34.770 --> 19:35.603
- Is it now?

19:36.443 --> 19:38.293
- A gentleman prefers blondes.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.100
- Where's your picture, Bonnie?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.440
- Got a lot of balls, pal.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.250
Bonnie, what do we run the psych ward now?

19:52.250 --> 19:53.280
- Oh, that's very funny, Charles.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.510
You look like a prime candidate.

19:54.510 --> 19:56.810
- Oh, now you're on his side.

19:56.810 --> 19:58.927
Bonnie and Jack, eh?

20:02.822 --> 20:03.655
- Okay.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.260
- Did he call?

20:09.260 --> 20:10.450
- Yeah.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.600
Said there's a problem.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.190
- My good friend Devlin.

20:20.190 --> 20:21.023
Have a seat.

20:21.890 --> 20:22.723
Come on, relax.

20:22.723 --> 20:23.556
Have a seat.

20:24.630 --> 20:26.420
Sit down, relax.

20:26.420 --> 20:28.043
Magnificent thread you have on.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.370
And those shoes.

20:31.370 --> 20:33.890
I can only dream of
having a pair of those.

20:33.890 --> 20:35.480
- How can I help you?

20:35.480 --> 20:38.400
Bruno was tightlipped as usual.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.860
- This robbery is bad for business.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.220
- Not only bad, it's insulting.

20:43.220 --> 20:44.720
Know what I mean?

20:44.720 --> 20:46.673
I need a report on this investigation.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.710
- I've got two suspects.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.890
One with a solid alibi.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.580
- Well you know I'm a
respectable business man

20:53.580 --> 20:55.520
and I can help you in many ways.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.760
And I can make Bruno available
to talk to your suspects.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.573
Bruno can be a very
persuasive interviewer.

21:05.093 --> 21:07.340
- I've got it under control.

21:07.340 --> 21:10.201
No one gets away with crime in our town.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.079
- Our town.

21:12.079 --> 21:13.340
Our town.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.440
Bruno, where the hell
does he come up with this?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.273
Our town.

21:23.330 --> 21:24.380
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.390
Miss Griffin called.

21:25.390 --> 21:27.070
I'm getting that grant money next week.

21:27.070 --> 21:28.030
- Thank God.

21:28.030 --> 21:29.980
You've been on a bad streak lately.

21:29.980 --> 21:30.990
Some things are looking up though.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.440
Jack has a good alibi in you.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.533
- What, you have doubts?

21:35.630 --> 21:37.200
Doubts are unacceptable.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.010
I must succeed with Jack.

21:39.010 --> 21:41.020
Otherwise you know where you're headed.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.290
- I know where I'm headed

21:42.290 --> 21:43.993
and what I have to do to get there.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.890
- You're not in jail.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.850
So what?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.220
- Yeah, but if I don't
do something quickly,

21:51.220 --> 21:52.950
the cops are gonna arrest me again.

21:52.950 --> 21:55.320
- Dr. Peselowe stuck his
neck out to save you.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.150
He now wonders what the
hell he was thinking.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.060
- Bonnie, that's enough.

21:58.060 --> 21:59.940
- Okay, you're the one out on a limb.

21:59.940 --> 22:03.120
- Look, I appreciate everything
you guys are doing for me.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.920
If you wanna steer clear, I get it.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.300
- Who else is gonna take care of you?

22:06.300 --> 22:08.210
- Apparently half the town.

22:08.210 --> 22:09.720
Why, are you offering?

22:09.720 --> 22:11.963
- Sure, Mr. Only Suspect.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.762
- Goddamn thing.

22:34.163 --> 22:36.190
What are you doing here?

22:40.688 --> 22:42.358
What, you don't shut doors?

22:58.010 --> 22:59.703
- Chief Nelson's dead set on you.

23:01.370 --> 23:02.210
Whew.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.300
It's personal.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.940
Small town personal.

23:04.940 --> 23:06.780
- You know I didn't do it.

23:06.780 --> 23:09.593
- Even if that's what my
gut tells me, he's my boss.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.567
Somebody's gotta go to jail, right.

23:14.062 --> 23:15.223
I've got some leads.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.130
Like this guy.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.748
We were able to pull a
partial print off your van.

23:20.748 --> 23:21.649
Know him?

23:21.649 --> 23:22.482
- No.

23:22.482 --> 23:23.920
Should I?

23:23.920 --> 23:26.107
- I'm betting he knows something.

23:26.107 --> 23:27.907
I don't have enough to bring him in.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.413
Bathroom.

23:54.800 --> 23:59.610
Now Jack, you make any new
friends, you give me a holler.

23:59.610 --> 24:02.460
Oh and don't do anything
reckless on your own.

24:02.460 --> 24:04.041
Okay, champ?

24:34.567 --> 24:37.241
Hey Jack, what are you having?

24:37.241 --> 24:39.344
- Hey, how you doing, Marnie?

24:39.344 --> 24:40.761
Can I get a beer?

24:41.907 --> 24:42.834
You know what?

24:42.834 --> 24:44.431
Get one for this guy, too.

24:44.431 --> 24:47.058
Sure thing.

24:47.058 --> 24:49.260
- Must be my lucky day.

24:55.091 --> 24:57.634
- What you got there?

24:57.634 --> 25:00.163
- My bail bondsmen gave me this.

25:01.570 --> 25:03.073
I was hire of the year.

25:04.967 --> 25:06.073
Name's Sharky.

25:07.220 --> 25:08.053
- Sharky.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.010
Sounds like a name of a
guy who would rob a place

25:12.010 --> 25:13.410
and pin it on somebody else.

25:14.996 --> 25:16.496
Like the Hideaway.

25:18.570 --> 25:20.270
I got arrested for that job the other day

25:20.270 --> 25:24.030
and I didn't do it but I guess
you already know that, huh?

25:26.052 --> 25:27.302
- So you're Jack Brenner.

25:28.774 --> 25:31.174
- And I'm looking for the
scumbag who set me up.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.610
Wouldn't it be wise for you
and me to go to the cops?

25:38.015 --> 25:40.192
- You look a lot dumber than you thought.

25:40.192 --> 25:41.413
- Yeah.

25:41.413 --> 25:43.516
Well you're not thinking at all.

25:46.950 --> 25:48.367
- Get lost, Jack.

25:50.432 --> 25:52.424
- You're coming with me.

25:52.424 --> 25:54.697
- Jack, get out now.

25:57.419 --> 25:58.784
- This isn't over.

25:58.784 --> 26:00.380
- Yeah, that's right.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.014
This ain't over.

26:02.014 --> 26:03.473
Next time I see you, you're a dead man.

26:04.617 --> 26:05.450
You know what?

26:05.450 --> 26:07.810
Get me a shot on his fucking money.

26:29.169 --> 26:30.862
What the hell is she doing here?

26:30.862 --> 26:32.097
You need a bodyguard?

26:32.097 --> 26:33.770
- The cops are after Jack Brenner.

26:33.770 --> 26:36.063
It was perfect, except
you hit me too hard.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.224
Time to pay up.

26:38.224 --> 26:39.110
- New deal, junkie.

26:39.110 --> 26:40.397
Next time you wanna get high,

26:40.397 --> 26:42.340
you come and visit your buddy Sharky

26:42.340 --> 26:43.473
and then everybody's happy.

26:44.511 --> 26:45.990
- Are you crazy?

26:45.990 --> 26:48.460
We give you a job and
you're gonna screw us?

26:48.460 --> 26:53.440
You're gonna pay us our money
or I visit Sharky in jail.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.038
- You both set this up.

26:55.038 --> 26:56.498
I'm not fucking playing.

26:56.498 --> 26:58.700
You were too scared to
get the fucking money.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.800
Now it's fucking mine.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.210
Bitch, you pull something on me,

27:02.210 --> 27:03.900
you better be ready to fucking use it.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.550
- Oh, I'm ready to use it,

27:05.550 --> 27:08.403
but more importantly I'm
not afraid to use it.

27:10.910 --> 27:12.570
Don't get greedy, Sharky.

27:12.570 --> 27:14.260
You stick to the plan.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.320
You don't know who you're messing with.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.120
- At least you got more balls
than bitch number one here.

27:18.120 --> 27:18.970
- We made the plan.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.970
We took the risks.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.280
It's time to pay up.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.380
- I'll think about it.

27:24.279 --> 27:26.450
But I'm keeping most of it.

27:32.370 --> 27:33.840
- You better get that money.

27:33.840 --> 27:37.050
You promised me that you
could get me to Mexico.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.370
- I'll get you the money.

27:38.370 --> 27:40.493
I promise I will get you the money.

27:41.550 --> 27:44.050
- You better, Charles, 'cause I need

27:44.050 --> 27:45.646
to get out of this town.

27:45.646 --> 27:47.312
You understand?

29:38.848 --> 29:39.765
- Hey, Mom.

29:43.207 --> 29:44.540
I got you these.

29:46.806 --> 29:47.806
How are you?

29:51.768 --> 29:53.100
I hope somehow you're able

29:53.100 --> 29:55.933
to find happiness wherever you are.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.743
I brought you a little something.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.967
Just don't tell Susan, okay.

30:03.967 --> 30:05.796
She'll kick my butt.

30:15.967 --> 30:18.723
It's not fair what happened to us.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.633
To our family.

30:23.303 --> 30:24.703
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

30:25.785 --> 30:27.035
I just cause you trouble.

30:29.950 --> 30:31.420
I want you to know that Dr. Peselowe,

30:31.420 --> 30:33.427
he's tried so hard to help me.

30:34.892 --> 30:37.309
I feel like I'm almost there.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.793
I'll find a way, okay.

30:44.380 --> 30:45.423
God, I miss Dad.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.631
- I said you're not leaving me.

30:51.631 --> 30:52.905
Never.

30:52.905 --> 30:53.950
Don't turn your back on me.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.800
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.090
That's excellent, Maggie.

30:58.090 --> 30:58.923
Joe, thank you.

30:58.923 --> 30:59.756
Have a seat.

31:00.620 --> 31:04.210
Before we call it, would
anybody else like to share?

31:04.210 --> 31:05.360
Benny?

31:05.360 --> 31:06.600
- Why would you call on me?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.879
You know I hate when you call on me.

31:08.879 --> 31:09.712
Why?

31:14.370 --> 31:15.203
Sorry.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.163
- It's okay.

31:19.222 --> 31:22.610
Let's go ahead and stop right there.

31:22.610 --> 31:25.470
I want you all to have a nice, calm night.

31:25.470 --> 31:26.303
Okay?

31:26.303 --> 31:27.210
We'll see you next session.

31:28.908 --> 31:31.350
Jack, would you mind
staying behind, please?

31:35.150 --> 31:36.210
- What happened?

31:36.210 --> 31:37.330
- I met the guy who framed me.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.253
We didn't get along so well.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.720
- Well that's foolish.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.553
Did you learn anything?

31:42.553 --> 31:45.150
- No, I mean, he lost his
shit and I guess I lost mine,

31:45.150 --> 31:47.143
but I stopped before anything happened.

31:48.090 --> 31:50.700
- Well, at least we're making progress.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.763
What do you think?

31:51.763 --> 31:52.963
- I think so, too.

31:53.890 --> 31:54.723
- Okay.

32:06.198 --> 32:08.710
- That was excellent, Jack.

32:08.710 --> 32:10.230
You're getting close my friend.

32:10.230 --> 32:11.530
- Close?

32:11.530 --> 32:12.700
Close?

32:12.700 --> 32:14.050
No, you're getting close.

32:14.050 --> 32:16.853
Close to killing her and
driving me fucking insane.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.890
- Jack, you can stop whenever you'd like.

32:20.890 --> 32:22.600
Just remember we have
your best interest here.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.500
Fuck you.

32:43.370 --> 32:44.627
- It's just a little messy, huh?

32:44.627 --> 32:45.877
- A little bit.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.090
- I estimate the time of death to be

32:49.090 --> 32:51.400
between six and 12 last night.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.910
There are signs of strangulation

32:52.910 --> 32:54.640
with a wire around his neck,

32:54.640 --> 32:56.660
but someone definitely
tried to play basketball

32:56.660 --> 32:57.720
with his head against the floor.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.750
- So you think somebody bashed
his head into the ground.

33:00.750 --> 33:02.630
- No, it was a single strike.

33:02.630 --> 33:04.520
There's no indentation on the head

33:04.520 --> 33:05.860
to indicate that he was struck

33:05.860 --> 33:07.743
with a blunt object of any kind.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.750
He cracked his skull from a fall.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.290
Maybe he tripped or something.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.570
- Or maybe the killer strangled him

33:14.570 --> 33:17.070
and dropped him on the ground.

33:17.070 --> 33:18.690
- Or that.

33:18.690 --> 33:20.790
- And there's tools all
over the ground, right?

33:20.790 --> 33:22.143
No blood on the tools.

33:23.026 --> 33:24.960
Obviously a scuffle.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.710
During the scuffle, maybe
the toolbox gets broken open.

33:29.040 --> 33:29.890
- There's a toolbox.

33:29.890 --> 33:30.723
Where is it?

33:30.723 --> 33:31.690
I examined the body.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.350
I didn't see a toolbox anywhere.

33:33.350 --> 33:36.740
- So it appears we can
rule out accidental death.

33:36.740 --> 33:37.573
- I would agree with that.

33:37.573 --> 33:38.720
- Narrow that down.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.330
- Gee, you think?

33:40.330 --> 33:44.100
Listen, I spoke to the worker
that found Sharky's body

33:44.100 --> 33:46.453
and he said that his
red toolbox was missing.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.420
- That solves the toolbox mystery.

33:49.420 --> 33:53.363
- So, the work of a mad
electrician possibly?

33:54.410 --> 33:55.940
Can we get Brenner back to the station?

33:55.940 --> 33:56.773
Yeah, I'm on it.

33:56.773 --> 33:57.606
- Thank you.

33:57.606 --> 33:58.913
Hope not to see you again soon.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.210
Where's Doc?

34:02.210 --> 34:04.353
- He's dealing with a patient.

34:04.353 --> 34:05.903
I got you some coffee.

34:08.040 --> 34:08.975
- Thank you.

34:08.975 --> 34:10.720
You're welcome.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.970
- You know, you really should think

34:12.970 --> 34:14.385
about ditching this jacket.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.530
- Yeah well, I'm attached to it.

34:16.530 --> 34:19.600
- It's hard to get rid of
things you're attached to.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.833
- Like in your case Charles?

34:25.260 --> 34:27.040
- The police are here.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.690
They're looking through your van.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.663
- Oh shit.

34:31.663 --> 34:33.130
I gotta get out of this town.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.749
- Where you gonna go?

34:34.749 --> 34:35.693
- I don't know.

34:35.693 --> 34:36.660
Acapulco.

34:36.660 --> 34:37.800
- Mexico?

34:37.800 --> 34:40.200
Dr. Peselowe said you'd
never leave your mother.

34:41.190 --> 34:42.643
Would you, Jack?

34:43.799 --> 34:44.632
- I gotta go, okay.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.343
Fucking dick.

35:00.747 --> 35:02.003
- Cut yourself shaving?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.840
- You're wasting your time with me.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.040
- Maybe I like wasting my time.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.223
- Look, I had nothing to do
with the robbery or the murder.

35:10.599 --> 35:14.377
- Do you by any chance
have a talk with Sharky?

35:15.350 --> 35:17.287
If you did, be smart to tell me now

35:17.287 --> 35:20.880
'cause this has your MO all over it.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.080
- No idea what you're
talking about it, sir.

35:24.300 --> 35:29.300
- You know, his killer
unleashed a lot of anger.

35:29.470 --> 35:30.303
Very violent.

35:30.303 --> 35:31.136
- Your point?

35:33.820 --> 35:35.800
- Does this look familiar?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.263
- I got all kinds of wires.

35:39.740 --> 35:41.190
- How 'bout the robbery then?

35:42.950 --> 35:45.050
Can't see Sharky doing this on his own.

35:45.050 --> 35:48.363
You know it's a lot more than $200.

35:49.250 --> 35:52.123
And between you and me,
I don't trust Charles.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.900
Couldn't find anything in
his place or his bar so.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.830
- Oh, so you're telling
me that small town cops

35:57.830 --> 36:00.180
are having a hard time
figuring things out, hm.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.123
- You got me.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.520
You're just way smarter than us.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.980
I give up.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.860
Where's the money, Jack?

36:09.860 --> 36:10.830
- What's wrong?

36:10.830 --> 36:13.310
You don't have any other suspects?

36:13.310 --> 36:14.860
- Sorry.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.280
No do overs.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.300
You had your chance.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.113
- You think you're the only
one after me right now, Devlin?

36:21.410 --> 36:24.852
- I'm just getting started
coming after you, Brenner.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.270
- Okay.

36:26.270 --> 36:27.920
- Where do you think you're going?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.580
- You would have arrested
me if you had any evidence,

36:29.580 --> 36:31.540
so when you make some up, you let me know.

36:31.540 --> 36:32.593
- You know me.

36:32.593 --> 36:34.423
I'll do whatever it takes.

36:35.330 --> 36:36.163
Prick.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.437
Can I get
you another one, Nash?

36:43.437 --> 36:44.890
- Sure.

36:44.890 --> 36:45.733
Hey, Jack.

36:48.484 --> 36:49.817
Where you going?

36:53.350 --> 36:55.023
My favorite client.

36:56.230 --> 36:57.920
Thanks for meeting me here.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.040
Why were you walking back out?

37:00.040 --> 37:01.670
- Nevermind that.

37:01.670 --> 37:02.920
- Listen.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.960
I appreciate that you met with Devlin,

37:05.960 --> 37:09.483
but please do not go without me again.

37:10.994 --> 37:13.850
That is a dangerous maneuver, my friend.

37:13.850 --> 37:15.743
Yeah, well I handled it.

37:15.743 --> 37:16.576
- Cheer up.

37:16.576 --> 37:17.797
You're a free man.

37:17.797 --> 37:19.207
For now.

37:19.207 --> 37:21.280
Can I get you a shot, Jack?

37:21.280 --> 37:22.140
- Just a beer, Marnie.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.530
Sure thing.

37:27.653 --> 37:30.237
- All I need is my six shooter, you know.

37:36.770 --> 37:38.670
Another private experimental exercise.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.327
Would you let me again?

37:42.327 --> 37:45.703
All these marks on poor Jack's face.

37:52.850 --> 37:55.350
Go take a seat, Charles.

37:55.350 --> 37:56.203
Take a load off.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.844
- I know you want what's mine.

38:04.844 --> 38:06.314
That's not gonna happen.

38:06.314 --> 38:07.399
- No.

38:07.399 --> 38:09.010
Chill out.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.900
Sorry about that, Nash.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.030
- It's okay.

38:18.030 --> 38:18.992
You all right?

38:18.992 --> 38:19.825
Yeah.

38:19.825 --> 38:20.902
I'm good.

38:26.456 --> 38:27.583
- Is there much pain, Melvin?

38:28.470 --> 38:29.810
- Comes and goes.

38:29.810 --> 38:31.460
- Sorry you got it so tough, man.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.433
- Pearl told me about
that robbery frame up.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.680
- Yeah, well I'll manage.

38:40.680 --> 38:41.980
- She worries.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.863
You find the guy who did
it, you'll go off on him.

38:48.070 --> 38:49.320
- Thank you.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.153
- Welcome.

38:52.442 --> 38:53.359
- Oh, here.

38:55.227 --> 38:56.274
Got it.

39:01.119 --> 39:02.750
Melvin, I got it, okay.

39:02.750 --> 39:03.793
- You're kind, Jack.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.000
- Where are your glasses?

39:08.093 --> 39:10.250
- I bought contacts.

39:10.250 --> 39:11.533
Takes getting used to.

39:12.432 --> 39:14.140
Like the look?

39:14.140 --> 39:15.140
- It's nice.

39:18.077 --> 39:20.193
- She wants to look good for you, Jack.

39:21.340 --> 39:23.070
She's always helping me,

39:23.070 --> 39:25.623
whether it's for my
business or my illness.

39:26.690 --> 39:30.367
When I'm gone, she needs a
life with a good man .

39:33.174 --> 39:34.174
- Oh, Jesus.

39:35.691 --> 39:38.333
- Not gonna be around forever.

39:38.333 --> 39:39.353
What will she do?

39:39.353 --> 39:40.353
- I'm sorry.

39:41.582 --> 39:43.415
I'll take care of her.

39:44.792 --> 39:47.300
Got to head out, okay.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.710
Taking off, Pearl.

39:48.710 --> 39:49.910
Thanks for the lemonade.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.694
- Bye, Jack.

39:56.550 --> 39:57.510
I think we can agree

39:57.510 --> 39:59.010
that Brenner's not a murderer.

40:00.350 --> 40:03.000
- Doctor, you really think
you can cure these people?

40:04.240 --> 40:05.250
- Cure?

40:05.250 --> 40:06.563
You can't cure violence.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.990
I mean, with hard work and dedication,

40:08.990 --> 40:10.400
they can get a grip on their lives

40:10.400 --> 40:13.810
and yes I stand by my treatments.

40:13.810 --> 40:15.760
- But they're not always successful.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.610
- Oh, we're talking
about human nature here.

40:17.610 --> 40:18.493
- Human nature?

40:20.490 --> 40:22.023
So you treat these people.

40:22.950 --> 40:25.570
You let them out into the world

40:25.570 --> 40:27.903
and when they commit atrocities,

40:30.625 --> 40:32.653
you write it off as human nature.

40:34.417 --> 40:36.510
- Has the doctor told
you he has a few ideas

40:36.510 --> 40:38.230
on how to clear Jack?

40:38.230 --> 40:39.260
He gave me the gist.

40:39.260 --> 40:42.493
- Bonnie, the people we treat
count on our discretion.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.793
- I wonder.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.823
What did you have to do to get this job?

41:06.640 --> 41:07.473
- Prick.

41:07.473 --> 41:09.963
- I think he must've had
a difficult childhood.

41:11.147 --> 41:11.980
Hey, doc.

41:11.980 --> 41:13.100
- Hey.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.400
- Came to fix that outlet.

41:15.490 --> 41:16.610
- Excellent.

41:16.610 --> 41:19.720
Can you do me a favor and
check the breaker box as well?

41:19.720 --> 41:22.150
- I can't do it now, but I'll
come back later, all right.

41:22.150 --> 41:22.983
- Fine.

41:22.983 --> 41:23.816
That works for me.

41:23.816 --> 41:25.380
I'm gonna go use the little boy's room.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.200
- I was just gonna call you.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.690
Charles and I would
like to invite you over

41:30.690 --> 41:31.860
for a home cooked meal.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.780
- Charles invited me
and you think I'm nuts.

41:34.780 --> 41:35.780
- Give it a chance.

41:35.780 --> 41:38.624
You have the doctor convinced
that somebody framed you.

41:38.624 --> 41:39.680
Why don't you convince Charles?

41:39.680 --> 41:41.360
- Because I don't care
what Charles thinks.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.430
I don't care if he believes me.

41:42.430 --> 41:43.730
I don't trust him.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.000
- Do you trust me?

41:45.000 --> 41:46.050
I'd like to.

41:47.010 --> 41:48.320
- Wow.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.803
And I let you choke me.

41:50.740 --> 41:51.650
Forget it.

41:51.650 --> 41:52.810
I knew you wouldn't come.

41:52.810 --> 41:53.643
- Bonnie.

41:53.643 --> 41:54.480
No.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.313
- Bonnie.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.223
What time?

41:58.540 --> 42:00.087
Jesus.

42:12.220 --> 42:13.883
- Can I ask you something?

42:13.883 --> 42:15.697
Between you and I.

42:17.793 --> 42:19.153
Did you kill someone?

42:20.230 --> 42:22.170
- So you don't believe me either?

42:22.170 --> 42:23.664
I want to.

42:23.664 --> 42:25.056
- And what does that mean?

42:25.056 --> 42:25.889
- Well I don't know.

42:25.889 --> 42:27.700
I mean, did you happen to
notice a dead body at your feet

42:27.700 --> 42:29.110
with your fingers around his throat?

42:29.110 --> 42:30.670
- So first I'm framed for robbery

42:30.670 --> 42:32.480
and now I'm some fucking psycho killer?

42:32.480 --> 42:34.390
- Bad luck can make a man or break a man.

42:34.390 --> 42:36.107
That choice is up to you.

42:36.107 --> 42:37.950
And you would be rotting
in prison right now

42:37.950 --> 42:39.675
if I didn't lie for you.

42:39.675 --> 42:41.820
It kind of looks like you took the money.

42:41.820 --> 42:42.653
- That's crazy.

42:42.653 --> 42:44.000
For 200 bucks?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.860
Of all people, I thought
you would see the truth.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.680
- I'm not sure you know what
the truth is, my friend.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.950
- The truth is I don't have the money

42:50.950 --> 42:51.990
and I didn't rob the place,

42:51.990 --> 42:53.770
but I intend to find out who does.

42:53.770 --> 42:54.840
- You have no way of attacking.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.360
- I can fucking kill you
right now with this cane.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.193
You know that?

42:58.193 --> 42:59.026
- Sorry please, all right.

42:59.026 --> 43:00.000
I was just testing your anger

43:00.000 --> 43:01.600
without the safety of role play.

43:03.360 --> 43:04.850
You're an unsteady man, Jack.

43:04.850 --> 43:07.740
- Yeah, well not too
unsteady to take you home.

43:07.740 --> 43:08.573
Let's go.

43:22.450 --> 43:23.710
Hey, guys.

43:23.710 --> 43:24.543
Sorry I'm late.

43:26.190 --> 43:27.293
Brought a little something.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.920
- Bonnie tells me you
think you were set up

43:33.920 --> 43:37.830
for robbing my tavern and that
same guy killed that biker.

43:37.830 --> 43:39.560
Sounds like a two for one special.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.290
- Yeah, frame up special.

43:41.290 --> 43:43.290
- Of course it couldn't have been Jack.

43:43.290 --> 43:46.650
He's such a good little boy
now that my girl's tamed him.

43:46.650 --> 43:48.310
- Is this what you invited me here for

43:48.310 --> 43:49.890
so I can listen to this crap?

43:49.890 --> 43:50.723
- Charles.

43:50.723 --> 43:51.556
- Charles what?

43:52.670 --> 43:53.503
Mark my words.

43:53.503 --> 43:55.373
He's gonna turn on you and Doc.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.960
Come on.

43:57.960 --> 43:58.793
Open it up.

43:58.793 --> 44:00.513
Let's see what loony tunes brought you.

44:18.070 --> 44:19.643
Dead end on the money so far.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.120
- Dead end.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.963
Well, in that case, I don't give a shit.

44:26.090 --> 44:28.340
I want the 500,000 that Brenner took.

44:28.340 --> 44:29.173
- Come on, man.

44:29.173 --> 44:30.525
I'm trying to figure this out.

44:30.525 --> 44:32.727
I'm still working on Dr. Peselowe.

44:32.727 --> 44:33.560
- Charles.

44:33.560 --> 44:36.130
Come on, you know how this works.

44:36.130 --> 44:38.840
Either that money finds
it's way back to me

44:38.840 --> 44:43.110
or you become the dead end.

44:43.110 --> 44:46.510
- Doc said that he asked
Jack about the money.

44:46.510 --> 44:48.310
- And I'm sure he tried his hardest.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.511
I want you to take this gun.

44:52.511 --> 44:55.371
I want you to find Peselowe
and I want you to kill him.

45:02.142 --> 45:04.593
I need to break Brenner.

45:05.780 --> 45:06.613
Don't worry.

45:06.613 --> 45:08.570
I'm gonna pin it on Jack.

45:08.570 --> 45:12.436
Now take the gun and kill Peselowe.

45:18.820 --> 45:19.823
You're worthless.

45:20.930 --> 45:23.173
Your girlfriend has
more balls than you do.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.493
Cheer up, Charlie.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.880
I'm gonna give you a temporary reprieve,

45:30.880 --> 45:33.700
but you better come up
with a reason real fast

45:33.700 --> 45:37.370
for me to change mind or
you might find yourself

45:37.370 --> 45:38.570
in the trunk of a stolen car

45:38.570 --> 45:40.799
with a couple of bullets in your brain.

45:43.780 --> 45:44.850
Goodnight.

46:10.330 --> 46:11.163
- Hello.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.563
Who's there?

46:24.430 --> 46:25.756
Hello.

46:35.434 --> 46:36.533
Oh God.

46:54.310 --> 46:55.143
- Hey, Doc.

46:56.865 --> 46:57.770
No, Doctor.

46:57.770 --> 46:59.700
Doc, you okay?

46:59.700 --> 47:00.559
Doc.

47:00.559 --> 47:01.392
- Hey, Dr. Peselowe.

47:01.392 --> 47:02.943
That electrician van is parked illegally.

47:02.943 --> 47:04.060
I'm gonna need you to move it.

47:04.060 --> 47:04.893
Hey.

47:05.919 --> 47:06.752
Hey.

47:08.024 --> 47:08.857
Shit, Doc.

47:10.793 --> 47:12.277
Doc.

47:14.914 --> 47:16.716
911, what's your emergency?

47:26.770 --> 47:28.780
- Dr. Peselowe got attacked.

47:28.780 --> 47:31.080
Looks like he's gonna be fine.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.880
But Edgar the security guard found him

47:33.880 --> 47:35.907
and sees Jack running out of the house.

47:37.710 --> 47:40.360
- Look, nothing's missing
so we can rule out robbery.

47:41.670 --> 47:44.493
- Well, why would Brenner
attack the good Dr. Peselowe?

47:46.240 --> 47:47.073
- Human nature.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.400
- What?

47:50.400 --> 47:51.233
- I don't know.

47:53.260 --> 47:56.130
- Let's go talk to Jack Brenner again.

47:56.130 --> 47:57.203
The jackass.

48:01.590 --> 48:03.490
- How many times are
we gonna do this, guys?

48:03.490 --> 48:04.323
- You tell me.

48:04.323 --> 48:05.156
Just have a seat.

48:09.770 --> 48:11.690
Dr. Peselowe was almost murdered,

48:11.690 --> 48:13.420
but that's no big surprise to you.

48:13.420 --> 48:14.430
- No, you know what would be a surprise?

48:14.430 --> 48:15.535
Some good news.

48:15.535 --> 48:17.350
- Well, here's some.

48:17.350 --> 48:19.690
We have a witness that saw you
fleeing the doctor's office,

48:19.690 --> 48:21.600
but that's more for us really.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.130
- Gentlemen, good news.

48:23.130 --> 48:24.540
Here's our guy.

48:24.540 --> 48:26.360
Nobody knocks.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.430
- Oh.

48:27.430 --> 48:28.330
Oh, yeah.

48:28.330 --> 48:29.163
That's the guy right there.

48:29.163 --> 48:30.560
- Edgar have a seat.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.494
- Have a seat.

48:31.494 --> 48:33.210
What, no two way mirrors?

48:33.210 --> 48:34.510
- No, that's for cowards.

48:34.510 --> 48:35.343
Take a seat.

48:40.900 --> 48:42.560
- Edgar.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.022
Is this the man you saw
fleeing Dr. Peselowe's office?

48:46.022 --> 48:47.500
- Mm hm.

48:47.500 --> 48:48.633
- I want my lawyer.

48:49.563 --> 48:52.070
- You're going away for a long time.

48:52.070 --> 48:54.310
- I'm not guilty.

48:54.310 --> 48:55.560
I would never hurt the doctor.

48:55.560 --> 48:56.740
He saved my life.

48:56.740 --> 48:59.393
- You beat him with his
own cane like an animal.

49:01.020 --> 49:01.853
Ooh.

49:03.770 --> 49:05.720
An on off switch.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.410
I guess that wasn't working earlier, huh?

49:07.410 --> 49:10.370
- Oh yeah, his switch is still on.

49:10.370 --> 49:12.030
This dude is crazy.

49:12.030 --> 49:13.530
I don't want no part of this.

49:13.530 --> 49:15.410
This guy is crazy, man.

49:15.410 --> 49:16.370
I'm out of here.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.203
- Hey.

49:17.203 --> 49:18.036
Nah.

49:18.036 --> 49:18.869
- Edgar.

49:21.678 --> 49:23.523
- Bonnie just alibied Jack.

49:24.920 --> 49:27.410
Says she was with him the whole night.

49:27.410 --> 49:28.460
- That's never gonna.

49:30.220 --> 49:31.053
- See you later, guys.

49:31.053 --> 49:33.393
- Don't get comfortable, Jack.

49:40.970 --> 49:43.470
- Look, we need to convince
them I didn't do this.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.543
- Devlin's got you in his cross hairs now.

49:46.543 --> 49:47.893
He's not gonna let up.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.460
- Swear to God I gotta quit drinking.

49:51.460 --> 49:53.735
I can't remember anything.

49:53.735 --> 49:54.568
Ugh.

49:54.568 --> 49:55.401
Ah.

49:56.790 --> 49:58.210
Find a way to get back to work.

49:58.210 --> 49:59.410
Can you hand me my notebook?

49:59.410 --> 50:00.590
Did you find it?

50:00.590 --> 50:01.960
- I'm sure it's gonna turn up.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.410
- Why would somebody
take your notebook, Doc?

50:04.410 --> 50:05.470
- I don't know.

50:05.470 --> 50:06.640
Because there are people out there

50:06.640 --> 50:07.870
that aren't fans of my method

50:07.870 --> 50:10.150
and they would like to see me fail.

50:10.150 --> 50:11.960
- I don't wanna see you fail,

50:11.960 --> 50:14.650
but I do think I can prove
that Jack didn't do this.

50:14.650 --> 50:16.143
I just I need to go home.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.470
Can you take her?

50:18.470 --> 50:19.440
- Doc.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.273
- I'm fine.

50:20.273 --> 50:21.106
I'm fine.

50:21.106 --> 50:22.363
I have some things I need to do.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.890
I'll call you later, Doctor.

50:26.890 --> 50:28.200
Thank you.

50:38.945 --> 50:40.300
- All right, so I'm here.

50:40.300 --> 50:41.290
Where's the proof?

50:41.290 --> 50:42.850
- Wait here.

50:42.850 --> 50:43.980
- Bonnie, stay away from this guy.

50:43.980 --> 50:46.424
- Don't fucking touch me.

50:48.820 --> 50:51.240
We'll finish this later, okay?

50:51.240 --> 50:52.940
You gonna be all right?

50:58.025 --> 51:01.015
- Yeah, now you worry
after you beat up her boss.

51:01.015 --> 51:04.260
Already made enough trouble
between Bonnie and I.

51:04.260 --> 51:05.490
- No, Charles.

51:05.490 --> 51:08.100
You do that all by yourself.

51:08.100 --> 51:10.340
How am I supposed to find
out if Jack has the money

51:10.340 --> 51:13.150
if this is how you act every
time you see us together?

51:13.150 --> 51:14.920
Stick to the plan.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.840
- Devlin wants Jack in jail
so he can break him down.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.703
- Okay, if Jack is in jail,
we'll never see the money.

51:20.703 --> 51:23.303
Plus, what if he doesn't
even have it to begin with?

51:24.420 --> 51:26.220
- Just don't fuck it up with Devlin.

51:27.676 --> 51:30.893
- Hey, you don't look so good, my friend.

51:32.790 --> 51:34.573
Usually you're a well dressed man.

51:35.828 --> 51:38.460
- Well, maybe it's because
I've been working overtime

51:38.460 --> 51:40.480
trying to find some missing money.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.313
- Some money?

51:44.600 --> 51:45.810
- I need more time.

51:45.810 --> 51:48.030
- Look, I've had it with
your excuses, Devlin.

51:48.030 --> 51:49.180
- Nero, I'll-

51:49.180 --> 51:50.300
- Don't Nero me.

51:50.300 --> 51:52.850
What do I look like, a fool?

51:52.850 --> 51:56.160
Just get me that $500,000
within 48 hours or else.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.210
You understand?

51:58.210 --> 51:59.870
- It's impossible.

51:59.870 --> 52:03.227
- Nothing's impossible when
you only have 48 hours to live.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.653
Remember, I own this town.

52:07.810 --> 52:09.624
Now go get my money.

52:28.202 --> 52:32.673
- You know, I figured out
who ripped this place off.

52:33.690 --> 52:35.220
It was Sharky and you.

52:36.335 --> 52:37.647
- Yeah.

52:37.647 --> 52:40.530
Wasn't that smart and I'm not that dumb.

52:40.530 --> 52:41.363
- Okay.

52:41.363 --> 52:44.212
So it was you and Jackie.

52:44.212 --> 52:45.045
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:45.045 --> 52:45.878
My best friend.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.813
- You knew I was coming
to make that pickup.

52:52.010 --> 52:55.510
Now I've got Nero up my
ass and I'm out 50 grand.

52:55.510 --> 52:56.580
- Yeah, you know everything.

52:56.580 --> 52:59.981
That's what I've come you
expect from a dirty cop.

52:59.981 --> 53:02.800
Charles.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.460
You know, honesty, decency.

53:04.460 --> 53:08.690
They're nice words, but they've
never kept anybody well fed

53:08.690 --> 53:10.723
and I have quite an appetite.

53:12.444 --> 53:16.720
Put pressure on Bonnie
to make Jack open up.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.330
Oh.

53:18.330 --> 53:20.390
You didn't think I knew about that?

53:20.390 --> 53:21.223
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

53:21.223 --> 53:22.793
Not after what Jack did to Doc.

53:24.616 --> 53:26.986
- Tell your girlfriend be a better lay.

53:29.657 --> 53:31.280
You ever pull anything like that again

53:31.280 --> 53:34.603
and I will fucking napalm
your goddamn world.

53:35.550 --> 53:38.312
Find the fucking money.

53:41.550 --> 53:43.087
Ah.

54:16.639 --> 54:17.803
- Sorry, Jack.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.283
- She had such a hard
life after my dad died.

54:24.764 --> 54:26.300
You know, everything
that she went through,

54:26.300 --> 54:27.450
she just couldn't cope.

54:30.210 --> 54:32.330
- I'll take care of the proceedings.

54:32.330 --> 54:34.995
I don't want you to worry about anything.

54:34.995 --> 54:39.995
- Thank you for everything
that you've done for her,

54:40.530 --> 54:41.780
how you've cared for her.

54:42.750 --> 54:43.800
How you've helped me.

54:45.695 --> 54:47.745
I wish there was a way I could repay you.

54:49.459 --> 54:50.762
- Maybe there is.

55:01.300 --> 55:04.133
I've always had a connection
with you and your mother, Jack.

55:05.673 --> 55:07.123
I tried so hard to help you.

55:08.967 --> 55:10.830
And I watched you improve so much

55:10.830 --> 55:12.470
to gain control of your life.

55:12.470 --> 55:13.303
- Yes, sir.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.360
- In your fragile mind,
stopping your father

55:17.360 --> 55:19.260
in the street is what caused his death

55:21.409 --> 55:23.523
when actually it was the driver's fault.

55:27.650 --> 55:28.823
- I still blame myself.

55:31.130 --> 55:36.130
I mean, the only facts I have
are that I stopped my father

55:36.540 --> 55:39.163
and he was killed.

55:40.520 --> 55:43.533
I mean, you've helped me
so much to control it.

55:46.553 --> 55:49.467
I mean, I feel like I'm almost there.

55:49.467 --> 55:52.053
- Like you, I suffer from extreme guilt.

55:53.830 --> 55:56.253
To rid mine has been
a complicated journey,

55:59.150 --> 56:01.300
but I hope what I'm
about to show you today

56:02.800 --> 56:05.013
will ease that burden not only for you

56:06.010 --> 56:07.610
and bring us both peace of mind.

56:32.376 --> 56:35.798
You forgot your thermos.

56:35.798 --> 56:37.930
- You were the driver?

56:37.930 --> 56:38.980
- I was a young doctor

56:38.980 --> 56:41.093
on the cutting edge of psychoanalysis.

56:42.140 --> 56:43.910
Pioneering new methods, I had the world

56:43.910 --> 56:45.483
in the palm of my hand, Jack.

56:47.537 --> 56:49.637
I was on my way home from an office party.

56:51.400 --> 56:52.430
I was celebrating an offer

56:52.430 --> 56:54.160
that I received from Oxford University.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.263
- So you were drunk?

56:56.936 --> 56:57.769
- No.

56:58.830 --> 57:01.033
I never touched a drop
before the accident.

57:03.080 --> 57:06.000
I've always regretted my decision, Jack.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.600
I ended somebody's life and
I didn't wanna end mine.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.623
So I compensated by taking
care of you and your mother

57:12.623 --> 57:15.267
and I know that's not enough, Jack.

57:15.267 --> 57:16.100
How could it be?

57:16.100 --> 57:17.972
I took your father's life.

57:43.974 --> 57:45.390
Jack.

57:45.390 --> 57:48.193
Now's a perfectly acceptable
time for you to get angry.

57:49.410 --> 57:51.710
Jack, aren't you gonna
call the cops at least?

57:59.025 --> 58:00.108
I deserve it.

58:06.460 --> 58:07.420
- Hey, Jack.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.083
- Hey, what's up?

58:09.083 --> 58:10.216
Hey, can I get a beer?

58:10.216 --> 58:11.049
- Yeah.

58:12.383 --> 58:14.233
- Sorry to hear about your mom.

58:16.900 --> 58:18.780
Are you having a service?

58:18.780 --> 58:19.703
- No.

58:19.703 --> 58:22.120
No, I don't believe in wasting
money on funeral expenses.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.370
I mean, what's the point?

58:24.860 --> 58:26.253
- Sensitive question.

58:27.346 --> 58:29.483
Do you get any insurance money?

58:30.550 --> 58:31.780
- Seriously, Nash?

58:31.780 --> 58:33.360
Right now?

58:33.360 --> 58:35.060
You're gonna get your money, okay.

58:36.140 --> 58:37.923
Okay, okay, I trust you.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.960
- Someone you don't trust was asking

58:40.960 --> 58:43.120
a lot of questions about you.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.963
Stoned and in a bad mood.

58:45.810 --> 58:47.369
Charles.

58:47.369 --> 58:49.660
- Yeah, what's new?

58:49.660 --> 58:52.910
- He was asking me if you
dropped a lot of bills in here.

58:52.910 --> 58:56.413
He invited me to the Hideaway
for a special gambling event.

58:56.413 --> 58:57.246
- What?

58:57.246 --> 58:59.280
- Gambling downstairs.

58:59.280 --> 59:00.113
- Downstairs?

59:01.247 --> 59:03.460
You know, I'm gonna check
that out for myself.

59:03.460 --> 59:05.448
- I don't think you're
gonna get an invitation.

59:05.448 --> 59:06.281
- No?

59:06.281 --> 59:07.977
Yeah, well I don't need one.

59:07.977 --> 59:09.477
You meet me there.

59:14.695 --> 59:15.778
Don't forget.

59:39.518 --> 59:41.394
Who are you?

59:41.394 --> 59:44.220
- Charles asked me to meet him here.

59:44.220 --> 59:45.350
- He didn't tell me.

59:45.350 --> 59:47.010
- Yeah, well we hang out.

59:47.010 --> 59:49.110
Mind if I wait here 'til he shows?

59:49.110 --> 59:50.760
- Hey Charles, get down here now.

59:51.640 --> 59:54.045
Hey, how'd you get in here?

59:54.045 --> 59:56.030
- I mean, the door wasn't locked.

59:56.030 --> 59:57.090
- What do you mean it wasn't locked?

59:57.090 --> 59:57.970
We have an alarm.

59:57.970 --> 59:59.620
- Well, you better get it checked out.

59:59.620 --> 1:00:01.750
Look, I hope I didn't get
anybody any trouble, guys.

1:00:01.750 --> 1:00:04.920
- The only one in trouble is gonna be you.

1:00:04.920 --> 1:00:06.659
You tell this guy you
were gonna meet him here?

1:00:06.659 --> 1:00:07.492
- What him?

1:00:07.492 --> 1:00:08.325
That's Jack Brenner.

1:00:08.325 --> 1:00:09.526
He's the guy that has your money.

1:00:13.658 --> 1:00:15.084
- Don't just stand there.

1:00:21.170 --> 1:00:23.234
Just tell me who has my money.

1:00:23.234 --> 1:00:24.705
- What are you talking about?

1:00:24.705 --> 1:00:25.750
- Answer the man.

1:00:25.750 --> 1:00:27.060
You killed the biker and
stole the money, right?

1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:28.960
- That's fucking crazy.

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:31.733
I'm looking for the guy who set me up.

1:00:33.633 --> 1:00:35.220
- No, no, no, no, Bruno.

1:00:35.220 --> 1:00:36.860
I don't want another dead body.

1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:37.993
I just want my money.

1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:41.518
I want my money.

1:00:45.116 --> 1:00:46.383
Police.

1:00:46.383 --> 1:00:47.216
Police.

1:00:47.216 --> 1:00:48.677
- Come in already.

1:00:51.850 --> 1:00:53.848
- You're lucky you're my client.

1:00:53.848 --> 1:00:56.443
- You're lucky you still have a client.

1:00:56.443 --> 1:00:57.776
Get out of here.

1:01:07.296 --> 1:01:08.546
Those bastards.

1:01:12.110 --> 1:01:13.580
You shouldn't
confront Charles yet.

1:01:13.580 --> 1:01:14.840
- Why not?

1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:17.340
Everyone's fucking with me and I'm done.

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:18.693
- You need to be careful.

1:01:19.850 --> 1:01:21.630
Those mob guys who attacked you own

1:01:21.630 --> 1:01:24.133
that gambling bar and Charles.

1:01:24.133 --> 1:01:27.090
- So then Charles has to be behind this.

1:01:27.090 --> 1:01:30.200
- Charles couldn't execute a
plan if a bit him in the ass.

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:32.813
- Yeah well, he sure executed
those kicks out right.

1:01:38.022 --> 1:01:40.690
I never thanked you for alibiing me.

1:01:40.690 --> 1:01:42.049
Thank you.

1:01:42.049 --> 1:01:44.020
- Well I had to do something.

1:01:44.020 --> 1:01:45.230
They were gonna put you in jail

1:01:45.230 --> 1:01:46.740
and what good would that do anyone?

1:01:46.740 --> 1:01:48.120
- Why?

1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:49.223
Who does it matter to?

1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:52.213
- Me.

1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:56.200
I promised Peselowe that I would help you.

1:01:57.420 --> 1:01:58.483
So let me help you.

1:02:00.854 --> 1:02:01.710
- I don't need your help.

1:02:01.710 --> 1:02:02.543
Not anymore.

1:02:05.450 --> 1:02:06.650
- Then give me the wire.

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:09.950
- Doesn't control me anymore.

1:02:19.970 --> 1:02:20.803
Hey.

1:02:22.050 --> 1:02:23.433
Yeah, no.

1:02:23.433 --> 1:02:24.933
All right, I'll be right over.

1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:28.493
What happened?

1:02:28.493 --> 1:02:29.326
Is everything all right?

1:02:29.326 --> 1:02:30.159
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

1:02:30.159 --> 1:02:31.900
I just I gotta take care of something.

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:34.720
Look, I'll drop you off at home.

1:02:44.589 --> 1:02:45.422
Pearl.

1:02:48.185 --> 1:02:49.018
Pearl.

1:02:51.391 --> 1:02:52.319
Hey.

1:02:52.319 --> 1:02:53.152
You okay?

1:02:54.796 --> 1:02:56.478
What's that smell?

1:02:59.965 --> 1:03:02.717
Pearl, where's your father?

1:03:06.123 --> 1:03:07.866
No, no, Jack.

1:03:17.365 --> 1:03:19.770
- What happened here?

1:03:19.770 --> 1:03:21.437
Why didn't you call anyone?

1:03:23.568 --> 1:03:25.274
- So afraid.

1:03:28.905 --> 1:03:29.738
- Jesus.

1:03:32.641 --> 1:03:34.815
We got this, okay?

1:03:34.815 --> 1:03:36.582
We got this.

1:03:36.582 --> 1:03:37.935
Here.

1:03:37.935 --> 1:03:39.153
- No, not the police.

1:03:40.582 --> 1:03:43.209
I have to show you something.

1:04:06.615 --> 1:04:09.365
It's all there, except for 5,000.

1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:14.220
I bought my contact lenses,

1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:16.393
went to the dentist and got my hair done.

1:04:17.970 --> 1:04:18.803
All for you, Jack.

1:04:18.803 --> 1:04:20.410
- I don't wanna hear it.

1:04:20.410 --> 1:04:22.910
This money has fucked up my life.

1:04:22.910 --> 1:04:23.963
Do you realize that?

1:04:25.260 --> 1:04:27.110
I've been arrested.

1:04:27.110 --> 1:04:28.640
I've been beat up.

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:30.184
I was almost killed.

1:04:34.702 --> 1:04:36.193
So what?

1:04:36.193 --> 1:04:38.110
You followed me to Charles' warehouse?

1:04:38.110 --> 1:04:38.943
Is that it?

1:04:38.943 --> 1:04:41.503
- Sometimes I follow you
thinking you're meeting Bonnie.

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:44.950
I was surprised you went
to the bar and left so soon

1:04:44.950 --> 1:04:46.870
and at this warehouse I heard a scream

1:04:46.870 --> 1:04:48.747
and went in to make sure you didn't.

1:04:48.747 --> 1:04:51.453
- You should not have gone there.

1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:54.363
- He looked dead.

1:04:56.220 --> 1:04:58.400
He swung at me wildly and did it himself.

1:04:58.400 --> 1:04:59.293
I didn't do it.

1:05:00.604 --> 1:05:01.771
Help me, Jack.

1:05:03.231 --> 1:05:04.351
Please.

1:05:08.353 --> 1:05:10.331
- You put this away.

1:05:10.331 --> 1:05:12.228
I'll deal with the rest.

1:05:37.154 --> 1:05:39.640
- I haven't heard from you all day.

1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:41.250
What happened yesterday?

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:42.888
- Nothing.

1:05:42.888 --> 1:05:44.138
Nothing at all.

1:05:51.967 --> 1:05:53.543
That's my van.

1:05:54.431 --> 1:05:56.411
What the fuck is this?

1:06:04.490 --> 1:06:06.052
Charles set me up.

1:06:06.052 --> 1:06:06.885
- Okay.

1:06:08.485 --> 1:06:10.127
He's a jerk, but maybe
he's just a fall guy.

1:06:10.127 --> 1:06:12.260
- No, is that Charles' jacket?

1:06:12.260 --> 1:06:13.800
That proves it.

1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:16.603
I gotta call Devlin and
have him arrest Charles.

1:06:17.746 --> 1:06:18.579
Bonnie.

1:06:21.678 --> 1:06:22.511
Bonnie.

1:06:24.052 --> 1:06:24.885
Hey, hey, hey.

1:06:24.885 --> 1:06:28.688
- How did I end up with
a loser like Charles?

1:06:28.688 --> 1:06:29.995
- It's okay.

1:06:29.995 --> 1:06:31.995
I'm so naive.

1:06:33.087 --> 1:06:35.005
- It's not your fault, okay.

1:06:35.005 --> 1:06:36.672
It's not your fault.

1:06:37.748 --> 1:06:39.120
All right, come on.

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:41.440
- At first it was fun and then.

1:06:42.330 --> 1:06:44.423
And now I'm just cleaning
up all of his messes

1:06:44.423 --> 1:06:46.912
and I can't take it anymore.

1:06:46.912 --> 1:06:48.476
- I know.

1:06:48.476 --> 1:06:50.226
It's a lot right now.

1:06:51.825 --> 1:06:54.905
It's okay, all right.

1:06:54.905 --> 1:06:56.427
Bonnie.

1:06:56.427 --> 1:06:57.777
Bonnie, what about Charles?

1:06:59.130 --> 1:07:00.930
- Charles isn't coming home tonight.

1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:06.483
Don't you want me?

1:07:07.510 --> 1:07:09.460
- I just I don't know if this is right.

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:12.520
- Right.

1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:13.353
Left.

1:07:14.550 --> 1:07:16.949
All directions lead somewhere.

1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:14.423
- Very nice.

1:08:15.290 --> 1:08:16.563
Playing Mr. Detective?

1:08:19.980 --> 1:08:20.813
- So what?

1:08:21.665 --> 1:08:22.915
You and Sharky framed me.

1:08:23.965 --> 1:08:25.180
For what?

1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:26.690
The money?

1:08:26.690 --> 1:08:29.600
I saw the pictures of
the van in the jacket.

1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:31.120
- You killed Sharky.

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:33.043
By the way, where is my money?

1:08:35.060 --> 1:08:37.760
- Killing me will only make
it worse for you, Charles.

1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:40.943
Neither one of us is a murderer.

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:45.810
- So someone else is out
there stealing stolen money?

1:08:45.810 --> 1:08:46.858
Killing?

1:08:46.858 --> 1:08:47.691
Who?

1:08:49.479 --> 1:08:52.545
- The only thing we have
left is to help each other.

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:55.121
Come with me down to the station.

1:08:55.121 --> 1:08:56.371
Think about it.

1:08:57.370 --> 1:08:58.820
And if you're gonna shoot me,

1:08:59.683 --> 1:09:02.798
you're gonna have to do it in the back.

1:09:28.994 --> 1:09:30.810
I turn around and he went down.

1:09:30.810 --> 1:09:32.357
- Sounds a little convenient to me.

1:09:32.357 --> 1:09:33.190
- Seriously?

1:09:33.190 --> 1:09:35.460
What, are you just gonna
pin everything on me?

1:09:35.460 --> 1:09:36.293
- Let's go.

1:09:36.293 --> 1:09:37.126
- What the fuck?

1:09:37.126 --> 1:09:38.410
Are you arresting me?
- Easy.

1:09:38.410 --> 1:09:39.243
- Are you serious?

1:09:39.243 --> 1:09:40.076
I called you guys.

1:09:40.076 --> 1:09:41.640
Why would I call the cops if I did it?

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:42.780
That'd be dumb.

1:09:42.780 --> 1:09:44.760
- Maybe you're not as
dumb as we think you are

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:46.400
or maybe you're too
smart for your own good.

1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:48.410
Either way, we're gonna talk
about it at the station.

1:09:48.410 --> 1:09:49.243
There he is.

1:09:49.243 --> 1:09:50.784
Hey.

1:09:50.784 --> 1:09:51.617
Where the hell you going?

1:09:51.617 --> 1:09:52.940
I didn't think you'd wanna miss this.

1:09:52.940 --> 1:09:55.990
We're holding him on attempted murder.

1:09:55.990 --> 1:09:57.920
Or murder if Charles dies.

1:09:57.920 --> 1:09:58.910
Let's go, genius.

1:09:58.910 --> 1:10:00.010
- What happened there?

1:10:02.580 --> 1:10:04.400
- Jack, I heard what happened.

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:06.580
- So you don't believe me now either?

1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:07.710
- Of course I believe you.

1:10:07.710 --> 1:10:10.330
I just don't understand why.

1:10:10.330 --> 1:10:12.560
I didn't want you anywhere near Charles.

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:14.460
- Charles set me up.

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:15.893
Okay, I had to do something.

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:18.640
- And look where it got you.

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:21.280
Under arrest for attempted murder.

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:22.630
- No.

1:10:22.630 --> 1:10:24.627
I didn't do it, okay, but I know who did

1:10:24.627 --> 1:10:26.640
and I know where the money is.

1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:28.180
Now will you help me?

1:10:28.180 --> 1:10:29.430
- Of course I will, Jack.

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:31.830
We've been through so much together

1:10:31.830 --> 1:10:35.053
and we deserve a better life.

1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:37.620
Leave it to me.

1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:39.580
I know how to clear you.

1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:40.413
- Okay.

1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:42.573
Yeah.

1:10:43.661 --> 1:10:44.636
Bye.

1:10:58.350 --> 1:10:59.807
Hello?

1:11:02.510 --> 1:11:04.185
Is anybody there?

1:11:23.950 --> 1:11:25.880
- Hey, we're going over to Bonnie's.

1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:28.280
Jack said Charles planted
some evidence over there.

1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:29.782
- Oh, when did he tell you that?

1:11:29.782 --> 1:11:31.120
Is that before you tried to murder him?

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:32.620
- Why are you so upset, huh?

1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:34.057
Friends with Charles?

1:11:34.057 --> 1:11:35.730
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:11:35.730 --> 1:11:37.320
Knock it out, come on.

1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:38.686
Let's get over there, come on.

1:11:51.330 --> 1:11:52.560
Where's your boss?

1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:54.200
- Oh, is it my turn to watch him?

1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:55.300
None of your business.

1:11:56.800 --> 1:11:57.850
- It's right up here.

1:12:05.963 --> 1:12:08.053
- What do you expect to find up there?

1:12:09.570 --> 1:12:11.900
A whole lot of nothing.

1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:13.684
Hold on.

1:12:13.684 --> 1:12:18.027
I think I see something.

1:12:32.777 --> 1:12:33.853
- What'd I tell you?

1:12:43.854 --> 1:12:45.060
- $200.

1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:47.043
Guess that clears Jack, huh?

1:12:48.644 --> 1:12:50.419
- Very convenient.

1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:55.941
- Gentlemen.

1:13:00.430 --> 1:13:02.176
Enjoy your day.

1:13:05.472 --> 1:13:06.305
Oh, Jesus.

1:13:07.198 --> 1:13:08.031
Did you cut yourself shaving?

1:13:08.031 --> 1:13:09.850
- I oughta take you out right here.

1:13:09.850 --> 1:13:11.310
- Oh, you're not happy it's Charles.

1:13:11.310 --> 1:13:13.800
- Where's the fucking money?

1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:14.670
- Sorry.

1:13:14.670 --> 1:13:15.520
What money again?

1:13:16.933 --> 1:13:19.092
- Oh, you really must be crazy, huh?

1:13:19.092 --> 1:13:19.925
Don't you understand?

1:13:19.925 --> 1:13:22.270
I will kill everyone.

1:13:22.270 --> 1:13:23.780
Bonnie, the doc.

1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:25.210
I'll pin it on you.

1:13:25.210 --> 1:13:26.590
What are you gonna do, huh?

1:13:26.590 --> 1:13:28.802
Call the cops?

1:13:28.802 --> 1:13:29.635
- Nah.

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:31.837
50 50 split.

1:13:31.837 --> 1:13:33.930
250,000 each.

1:13:33.930 --> 1:13:34.930
Take it or leave it.

1:13:38.670 --> 1:13:39.918
- Deal.

1:13:39.918 --> 1:13:40.751
- Good.

1:13:40.751 --> 1:13:42.880
I'll be back in a half an hour.

1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.140
- I see that hand again, it
better be holding my money.

1:13:46.140 --> 1:13:47.452
Half an hour.

1:13:52.271 --> 1:13:53.104
It was Devlin.

1:13:53.104 --> 1:13:53.937
- How do you know?

1:13:53.937 --> 1:13:55.110
- He was at the warehouse.

1:13:55.110 --> 1:13:56.450
I gave him that cut.

1:13:56.450 --> 1:13:59.020
- We have to tread very carefully here.

1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:00.150
Should you let Wally know?

1:14:00.150 --> 1:14:01.800
- What, with no proof?

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:03.443
He could've gotten that cut anywhere.

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:05.944
You stay in the house.

1:14:05.944 --> 1:14:07.144
All right, I'll be back.

1:14:16.351 --> 1:14:17.640
- Where's the money, bitch?

1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:18.473
- Fucking piece of shit.

1:14:25.739 --> 1:14:27.261
- Give me the gun.

1:14:34.130 --> 1:14:36.150
You go make our arrangements.

1:14:36.150 --> 1:14:38.064
I'll take care of Devlin.

1:14:48.260 --> 1:14:49.613
Jack, I need your help now.

1:14:58.410 --> 1:15:00.950
- I'm glad you finally came to
your senses about the money.

1:15:00.950 --> 1:15:03.213
- Yeah well, it was never
about the money for me.

1:15:04.191 --> 1:15:05.358
- There he is.

1:15:06.380 --> 1:15:08.420
Jack, this is Mr. Van Damn.

1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:10.250
He's the gentleman I told you about.

1:15:10.250 --> 1:15:11.450
- So where's the pickup?

1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:20.105
- Thanks for coming, Wally.

1:15:20.105 --> 1:15:21.700
- Of course.

1:15:21.700 --> 1:15:23.310
Charles came out of the coma

1:15:23.310 --> 1:15:25.280
and admitted setting up the robbery,

1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.220
but he didn't kill Sharky.

1:15:27.220 --> 1:15:28.580
And I want Devlin to interview him,

1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:30.998
but Devlin's not answering his phone.

1:15:30.998 --> 1:15:31.831
- Hm.

1:15:32.715 --> 1:15:35.015
You know, it's unreal
that I was framed twice.

1:15:35.990 --> 1:15:38.700
Wally, you lived a good, moral life.

1:15:38.700 --> 1:15:39.533
I mean, you tell me.

1:15:39.533 --> 1:15:41.377
You think there's any payoff in the end?

1:15:42.219 --> 1:15:43.130
- I don't know about a payoff,

1:15:43.130 --> 1:15:46.010
but sometimes I wonder how
much fun I could've had

1:15:46.010 --> 1:15:48.300
if I didn't stay on the
straight and narrow,

1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:51.250
but my wife is basically a
walking Sicilian lie detector

1:15:51.250 --> 1:15:52.740
and I value my testicles.

1:15:52.740 --> 1:15:54.500
- Got it, yeah.

1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:55.890
Well, if I've learned anything
through this whole thing,

1:15:55.890 --> 1:15:58.820
it's just that money isn't everything.

1:15:58.820 --> 1:15:59.653
Well, let's get in there.

1:15:59.653 --> 1:16:00.486
They're waiting.

1:16:00.486 --> 1:16:02.080
Pearl doesn't have much family.

1:16:07.790 --> 1:16:08.934
- Very sorry for your loss.

1:16:08.934 --> 1:16:09.767
- Thanks.

1:16:09.767 --> 1:16:10.600
Chief Nelson.

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:11.936
- Chief, very sorry.

1:16:11.936 --> 1:16:12.803
Please.

1:16:41.898 --> 1:16:43.231
- My Aunt Josie.

1:16:44.258 --> 1:16:46.175
- Thank you for coming.

1:16:47.153 --> 1:16:47.986
- So sorry.

1:16:47.986 --> 1:16:49.920
- Thank you for coming.

1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:52.360
- And Wally, this is
Pearl's uncle Seymour.

1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:53.210
Jack.

1:16:54.258 --> 1:16:55.480
Sorry for your loss.

1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:56.563
- Nice to meet you.

1:16:56.563 --> 1:16:58.310
I just wish it was under
different circumstances.

1:16:58.310 --> 1:17:00.950
You know, Jack here has been a great help.

1:17:00.950 --> 1:17:03.747
He's been like the rock
of Gibraltar for Pearl.

1:17:03.747 --> 1:17:05.785
I don't know what she'd do without him.

1:17:05.785 --> 1:17:09.563
- Have to admit I misjudged
him a couple times.

1:17:10.670 --> 1:17:12.490
He's one standup guy.

1:17:12.490 --> 1:17:13.693
- Oh, thank you, gentlemen.

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:16.980
- Well Seymour, you have my condolences.

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:19.530
I know this must be very hard.

1:17:19.530 --> 1:17:20.363
- Thank you.

1:17:22.150 --> 1:17:23.600
My brother suffered terribly.

1:17:24.820 --> 1:17:27.563
You know, he was down to 90 pounds.

1:17:29.510 --> 1:17:32.333
Told Pearl I thought a
closed casket was best.

1:17:35.090 --> 1:17:35.923
- Take care.

1:17:35.923 --> 1:17:37.212
Thanks, Jack.

1:17:48.995 --> 1:17:51.861
- Will the family gather
together for the final goodbye?

1:18:35.452 --> 1:18:36.285
All right.

1:19:17.810 --> 1:19:19.150
Guests for hire.

1:19:19.150 --> 1:19:20.110
That is brilliant.

1:19:20.110 --> 1:19:22.640
That must be a lucrative business.

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:23.833
You do weddings, too?

1:19:24.810 --> 1:19:27.500
- Well, we provide people
for all kinds of events.

1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:29.117
People just wanna show
their distant relatives

1:19:29.117 --> 1:19:31.950
and their coworkers that
they've got friends and family.

1:19:31.950 --> 1:19:33.850
So we learn a few facts about our client.

1:19:33.850 --> 1:19:35.460
We make them someone.

1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:37.370
- You mean, somebody better?

1:19:37.370 --> 1:19:40.130
- Americans have aim, but business.

1:19:40.130 --> 1:19:42.140
Business is good.

1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:43.933
Hope you're satisfied with our service.

1:19:44.974 --> 1:19:45.807
- Later.

1:19:45.807 --> 1:19:46.861
Be well.

1:20:08.700 --> 1:20:10.298
- Tequila, Bonnie?

1:20:10.298 --> 1:20:11.430
- Oh, si.

1:20:11.430 --> 1:20:13.073
Hard work being a Pearl.

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:22.750
What is the matter?

1:20:23.750 --> 1:20:24.743
We pulled it off.

1:20:26.331 --> 1:20:27.530
- You had the doctor's notebook

1:20:27.530 --> 1:20:29.280
because you attacked him to get it.

1:20:30.530 --> 1:20:32.230
You believed I had the
money and you thought

1:20:32.230 --> 1:20:34.856
that if you replaced
him, you could get to me.

1:20:34.856 --> 1:20:36.850
- Peselowe found out I took
some of his grant money.

1:20:36.850 --> 1:20:38.170
I wanted to get rid of him anyway.

1:20:38.170 --> 1:20:39.330
And Devlin?

1:20:39.330 --> 1:20:41.129
How long before I'm next?

1:20:41.129 --> 1:20:42.610
- He lunged at me.

1:20:42.610 --> 1:20:44.290
I had to defend myself.

1:20:44.290 --> 1:20:45.123
Same with Pearl.

1:20:45.123 --> 1:20:47.840
She attacked me from behind
and I had to fight for my life.

1:20:49.730 --> 1:20:50.680
- You killed Pearl?

1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:53.480
How could you do that?

1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:55.460
She was an innocent kid.

1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:56.820
- What does it matter?

1:20:56.820 --> 1:20:57.920
We're going to Mexico.

1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:00.433
- No, Bonnie.

1:21:01.390 --> 1:21:04.320
I'm not going and neither is this.

1:21:06.750 --> 1:21:09.513
- That leaves with me.

1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:13.963
I told you when I take great
risk, I expect great reward.

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:18.263
- Leave now without the money.

1:21:20.243 --> 1:21:22.600
- I'll hate myself if I have to shoot you.

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:24.833
The money now.

1:21:25.970 --> 1:21:26.803
Three.

1:21:28.670 --> 1:21:29.937
Two.

1:21:33.950 --> 1:21:34.783
Good boy.

1:21:37.070 --> 1:21:38.970
- You're making a big mistake, Bonnie.

1:21:40.604 --> 1:21:43.582
Maybe I'll see you again sometime.

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:48.010
- I don't believe in maybe.

1:21:48.010 --> 1:21:52.880
With me, it's now or never
and you picked never so.

1:22:36.057 --> 1:22:37.594
- Give me the bag now.

1:22:40.420 --> 1:22:41.940
- Let's make a deal.

1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:42.773
- No deal.

1:22:42.773 --> 1:22:44.462
Just give me the bag.

1:23:18.470 --> 1:23:20.403
- That was a stupid move.

1:23:21.340 --> 1:23:22.696
You are bad.
