WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.378
Looks like you have
an equipment problem there, brother.

00:03.461 --> 00:05.588
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:05.672 --> 00:06.548
(crashes)

00:06.631 --> 00:08.508
LUCY: The chief got bit by a rat.

00:08.591 --> 00:09.926
Nothing to worry about.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.846
I think I winged the little bugger
in the left haunch.

00:12.929 --> 00:13.847
OFFICER: There were drops of blood.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.598
He's got to be locked up, Lieutenant.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.435
-Please! He wants to kill me. I know it.
-Mary...

00:18.518 --> 00:20.603
Some girls really don't know
how to handle rejection.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.606
According to Miss Hicks,
you were harassing her.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.818
-The rat that bit you was rabid.
-Rabid?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.778
You do good work, Miss McCoy.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.322
The feeling is mutual, Captain.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.659
One of these days I'm gonna learn
to offend a better class of people.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.203
(groans)

00:37.287 --> 00:40.957
All right, Country,
you wanna give me another ticket?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.084
I've been invited to interview for a job.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.211
Wonderful. What is it?

00:46.671 --> 00:48.006
With the Justice Department.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.301
I have to fly down to Washington
tomorrow afternoon.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.012
NARRATOR:
<i>And now tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:54.095 --> 00:56.681
I could tell that we have a lot in common.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.559
-(laughs)
-Maybe we should have dinner.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.061
I'd like that.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.604
You're supposed to help me.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.522
I can go bring him in, hold this over him,

01:04.606 --> 01:06.399
and even then it's gonna be
the judge's decision.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.151
I want you to understand that.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.820
You're in real trouble this time.
The judge could put you away.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.115
You got nothing on me that'll stick,
and we both know it.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.827
If they offer you this job,
we'll have a lot to talk about, won't we?

01:18.161 --> 01:20.038
Frank, I wish you wouldn't do this to me.

01:20.121 --> 01:23.124
-You know my partner.
-Now you want a piece, too?

01:23.208 --> 01:25.085
You're not as stupid as you look.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.212
I felt things had gone too far.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.005
-There were--
-DANIELS: You felt!

01:29.756 --> 01:32.550
This is not sensitivity training, Captain.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.844
I don't care what you felt.

01:34.928 --> 01:39.265
-(sirens approaching)
-(child crying)

01:39.349 --> 01:40.350
It's okay, boy.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.023
-MAN: It's a good idea, J.D.
-(crowd chattering)

01:47.107 --> 01:51.820
Item 13: Regarding the commencement
this a.m. of Operation Big Broom.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.488
(all groaning)

01:53.571 --> 01:58.243
This being the definitive fumigation
of that most infamous local landscape,

01:58.326 --> 02:00.745
the 1600 block of Dekker Avenue.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.706
Lieutenant Hunter will be conducting
a final briefing

02:03.790 --> 02:06.501
shortly after the commencement
of this roll call.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.379
Please check the duty roster
for the names of those officers

02:09.462 --> 02:13.258
whose attendance
is respectfully requested.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.513
And be advised that the scope
of this operation has been expanded,

02:19.222 --> 02:21.975
due in large part
to Chief Daniels' ill-fated encounter

02:22.058 --> 02:27.230
on the block yesterday
with an allegedly rabid rat.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.691
-MAN: Ooh!
-(crowd laughing)

02:29.774 --> 02:33.027
A creature subsequently
and heroically dispatched

02:33.111 --> 02:35.405
by our very own J.D. LaRue.

02:35.488 --> 02:39.117
(crowd cheering, applauding)

02:39.200 --> 02:41.786
You may wish to extend
your sympathies to the chief,

02:41.870 --> 02:47.208
who is currently undergoing the unpleasant
ordeal of acute hydrophobia therapy.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.504
And in doing so, people,
please exercise a little restraint.

02:51.588 --> 02:56.092
Keep any humorous references
of a rodential nature

02:56.176 --> 03:00.305
-to an absolute minimum.
-(crowd laughing)

03:00.388 --> 03:01.514
Last item.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.517
Concerning an irate communiquÃ©
received by this office,

03:04.601 --> 03:07.896
as regards an unfortunate
jurisdictional dispute

03:07.979 --> 03:13.276
between an officer from this precinct
and a member of that thankless sorority,

03:13.359 --> 03:14.485
a meter maid.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.364
Leave us attempt to toss
some bread upon these troubled waters,

03:18.448 --> 03:23.536
and remember that no matter how futile,
inconsequential and unappreciated

03:23.620 --> 03:29.918
we may perceive our own lot to be,
the beleaguered maidens of the meter

03:30.001 --> 03:32.712
traditionally occupy the lower-most niche

03:32.795 --> 03:36.841
of our particular food chain,
law-enforcement-wise.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.968
(crowd murmuring, laughing)

03:39.052 --> 03:43.473
And for the purposes of a sane
and balanced ecology,

03:43.556 --> 03:45.391
in any future dealings with said maidens,

03:45.475 --> 03:50.188
I urge you to consider the gentle,
enduring wisdom,

03:51.356 --> 03:54.108
of pity and compassion.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.985
(all murmuring)

03:56.069 --> 03:58.529
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:58.613 --> 04:03.660
And hey, hey, what do you say?
Let's be careful out there, huh?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.119
Hey, Renko.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.414
Not now, Bobby, I got some stuff
I gotta take care of.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.709
Boy, Bobby, Renko doesn't look so good.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.046
You think he's in bad shape,
you ought to see the meter maid.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.884
Judas H!
What in the world happened to you?

04:19.968 --> 04:22.470
Well, sir, I fell off
my motor scooter, sir.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.389
Well, where were you parked? On a cliff?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.893
Look at this baby.
It's got your pizza slice,

04:28.977 --> 04:32.438
your egg roll, your burrito,
your chicken wing.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.607
It's even got your bagel, Sergeant.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.733
Lieutenant.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.319
Hey! Lieutenant!

04:38.653 --> 04:40.738
-Have a bagel and a schmear on me.
-(beeps)

04:40.822 --> 04:42.240
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.450
Congratulations.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.872
HOWARD: Why, yes. Congratulations,
Lieutenant Goldblume.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.917
-Welcome to the ranks.
-Thank you, Howard.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.711
It must be a comfort to know

04:54.794 --> 04:58.673
that the wheels of justice
may grind slow, but they grind sure.

04:59.048 --> 05:02.260
I have been trying to console myself
similarly this morning.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.596
(exhales) Your Calletano-types win prizes.

05:05.847 --> 05:11.352
Your Chesley-types and now your
Goldblume-types get promoted.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.770
And my types?

05:15.148 --> 05:18.735
I say it's a little like the food
you're eating, Henry.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.989
-My food?
-Pumpernickel bagel.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.493
White bread, Ben.
Whatever happened to white bread?

05:27.910 --> 05:30.872
The bread of white Anglo-Saxon males.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.210
No wonder we can't get promoted.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.048
We can't even eat
in this department anymore.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.809
-That man is a gifted social critic.
-Yes.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.729
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:54.812 --> 05:56.522
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:56.606 --> 06:00.401
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:00.485 --> 06:02.070
(sirens wailing)

06:07.658 --> 06:11.454
(theme music playing)

07:42.420 --> 07:45.506
Hey, Washington, you know
a guy named Benedetto?

07:45.756 --> 07:48.759
Works Midtown Vice.
Big dude, got an attitude.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.470
Unless there's another Benedetto.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.346
No, no, no. That sounds like him.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.806
-Thanks, bro.
-All right.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.435
Man, something is dead in my intestines.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.979
(chuckles) See,
maybe you're being punished

08:00.062 --> 08:02.190
for letting the chief keep eating
that needle sandwich.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.358
Man, I can't tell him now
that I nailed the wrong rat.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.943
I'll be on the Rodent Patrol for life.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.279
Hey, you ever see the size
of those needles, man?

08:08.362 --> 08:10.281
I hear the treatment's a piece of cake.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.158
-I told you he'd come back!
-It's okay.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.951
-He's crazy! He wants to kill me!
-Come on.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.246
If the guy next door hadn't
heard me scream, he would have.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.873
Oh, God, please.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.042
Mary. Mary.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.878
Did your neighbor see him do this to you?

08:24.420 --> 08:25.796
No, he ran out the back.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.219
Why'd you let him in?

08:32.678 --> 08:35.515
He said he would bust down the door,
and he would've done it.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.891
There's no place else you can go?

08:36.974 --> 08:38.768
I can't quit my job.
He knows where I work.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.437
He's calling me all the time.
I don't have any money. I--

08:42.021 --> 08:43.606
You're supposed to help me.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.942
I'm so scared of the guy.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.570
Now, you can arrest him. He beat me up.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.156
You gotta. You said so. You gotta, please.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.117
Mary, I don't want to mislead you.
I can do that.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.620
I can go bring him in, hold this over him,

08:57.703 --> 08:59.956
maybe get a high bail set,
try to scare him off.

09:00.039 --> 09:00.957
I can do that.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.085
But you're gonna have to stick with me
all the way on this.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.920
You're gonna have to go sign
a complaint downtown.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.046
You're gonna have to testify

09:07.129 --> 09:09.382
maybe three or four times in court
with him right there.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.093
And even then, there's no guarantee.
It's gonna be the judge's decision.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.011
I want you to understand that.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.514
I'll do it.

09:17.139 --> 09:20.434
I'll do whatever you say.
Just please keep him away from me, please.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.438
Okay.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.775
With our barricades in place
here and here,

09:27.858 --> 09:32.113
we will move
into the north end of East Utica.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.615
And we will begin a pincer movement
from the south,

09:34.699 --> 09:36.826
moving the suspects into our holding area,

09:37.493 --> 09:40.580
which is the playground
here in the center of the block.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.708
Lieutenant, what kind of charges
are we talking about?

09:44.041 --> 09:48.296
-(sighs)
-Well, obstruction of pedestrian traffic,

09:48.379 --> 09:52.508
loitering with intent, unlawful assembly,
whatever you feel applies.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.220
Now look, remember, people,
we're not looking for convictions per se,

09:56.304 --> 09:59.140
as we are intimidation
and a demonstration of force.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.976
Lieutenant, you know,
some of us gotta live on this street.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.395
You want my opinion,
this whole thing's jive.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.521
FRANK: That's enough, J.D.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.107
If I may speak for him. Excuse me, Howard.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.484
What the chief is after here...

10:10.860 --> 10:15.406
is a demonstration of our ability
to clean up one bad block,

10:15.489 --> 10:16.741
uproot the drug traffic.

10:16.824 --> 10:20.411
While we're not after convictions here,
neither is this license to run amok.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.663
I expect you all to exercise restraint.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.292
I don't want to hear any horror stories.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.838
HOWARD: Phase two begins
with the mass booking

10:30.921 --> 10:36.636
and transport of suspects to this station,
Michigan Avenue and to South Ferry.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.387
(phone ringing)

10:38.471 --> 10:40.389
(tapping)

10:44.310 --> 10:45.895
Don't you have a plane to catch?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.189
I'm on my way. I've got a cab waiting.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.152
(clears throat)

10:54.528 --> 10:55.613
Frank, are you all right?

10:55.696 --> 10:58.491
Uh, fine. Really. How are you?

10:59.575 --> 11:02.244
Oh, I'm... kind of nervous.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.080
I wouldn't worry about the interview.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.208
I think the Justice Department
knows a class act when it sees one.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.630
-Frank, about last night--
-I didn't... I haven't said word one.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.258
It's the things you haven't said
that I'm concerned about.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.136
Look, if they offer you this job,

11:19.220 --> 11:22.306
we'll have a lot to talk about, won't we?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.600
Frank, I wish you wouldn't do this to me.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.437
It's just something I've gotta do.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.274
I love you, Pizza Man.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.160
(door opens, closes)

11:45.413 --> 11:47.456
-Uh, excuse me, Francis.
-What?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.210
You wanted me to remind you
about a 10:30 appointment

11:51.293 --> 11:53.379
-with Fay down at Frank Jr.'s school.
-Fine.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.424
-Fine, great.
-Everything all right, Francis?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.387
Yeah. (stammers) Just... It's fine, Phil.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.098
-Uh, was there something else?
-No.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.727
Frank, correct me if I'm wrong,

12:07.810 --> 12:11.897
but it seems to me that I had
the distinct impression downstairs

12:11.981 --> 12:14.692
that you're not exactly
chomping at the bit

12:15.025 --> 12:16.694
for this operation to go forward.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.113
Howard, the chief wants it
and the mayor wants it.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.449
What I think about it hardly
matters at this point.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.367
Well, it's just a cockroach
roundup, Frank.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.327
Nobody's saying it's Omaha Beach.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.456
That doesn't mean I have to like it.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.505
Frank, it is my perception that a day
like this is good for morale.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.048
The men go out there and they feel

12:38.132 --> 12:41.218
they're really impacting
the criminal population.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.472
In my opinion, Howard,
it's a shallow gesture,

12:44.555 --> 12:47.433
politically motivated,
principally for the benefit of the media.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.186
Forgive me
if I can't share your enthusiasm.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.235
Democracy's dialectic, old chum.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.238
Oh, where else but in America

13:01.322 --> 13:04.450
could two officers fundamentally
disagree about an operation

13:04.533 --> 13:07.703
and still go out there
and ream the opposition?

13:10.706 --> 13:14.043
(police sirens wailing)

13:30.142 --> 13:32.061
LUCY: All right, move it.
Hold it right there.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.270
JOE: Okay. Hey!

13:33.354 --> 13:35.981
LUCY: Up against the fence. Hold it there.

13:40.861 --> 13:41.946
Don't move.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.241
(police sirens wailing continues)

13:51.747 --> 13:54.291
MAN: All right. You--
You, line up these suspects.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.174
LUCY: Hold it right there.
Hold it. Up against the wall.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.884
HOWARD: You have the right to an attorney.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.845
If you cannot afford an attorney,

14:05.928 --> 14:08.472
one will be provided for you
before questioning.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.892
Now, during your stay
with us today, people,

14:12.309 --> 14:15.145
I hope that you will all reflect
upon the fact

14:15.229 --> 14:18.274
that without the law, we cannot live.

14:18.607 --> 14:23.779
The best of man's hopes
are ensured by its success.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.907
Its failures are our failures.

14:27.157 --> 14:30.119
And the measure to which it
can reconcile our passion,

14:30.202 --> 14:32.580
our will and our conflict

14:32.663 --> 14:36.333
is the measure of our opportunity
to find ourselves.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.960
Measure this, sucker.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.712
(metal clanging)

14:40.880 --> 14:42.840
-How you doing, Leo?
-I'm doing great, Luce.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.050
I was just running to my car
to put a dime in the meter.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.343
Boy, what a great day.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.345
You're making a mistake.
I work at the liquor store.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.097
I love being out in the fresh air
this time a year.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.516
If you work there,
what are you doing packing this?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.393
I been robbed five times in the last year.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.395
I need to tell you
what it's like down here?

14:56.478 --> 14:58.772
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station anyway.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.649
-Just check it out.
-Get a load of this.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.027
(motor engine revving)

15:03.110 --> 15:05.237
-BOBBY: Fine bike there, cowboy.
-RENKO: Yeah, I know it.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.156
Renko, did you put your Harley
in the dryer again?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.283
BOBBY: Hey, don't pay him
any mind, cowboy.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.160
Sticks and stones, my man.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.829
I just come down here to see
what you guys are up to today.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.916
-Well, you're not missing much today.
-I can tell that.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.889
No money? Uh-uh, uh-uh.
If you want to play, you got to pay.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.683
No ducats, no ducci.
Don't you get sick on me, man.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.769
Hey, look at this. Here comes the man.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.438
Hey, fool, who you trying to kid
with all this stuff?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.065
This is just bogus, jack!

15:41.148 --> 15:42.441
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

15:42.524 --> 15:44.652
Hey, you see any
other fools out here, heat, huh?

15:44.735 --> 15:47.404
I'm looking at a real
prizewinner right now.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.990
Hey, look, I knows my rights.
I knows my rights.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.660
-You can't touch me.
-Oh, yeah? Well, watch this, huh?

15:52.743 --> 15:55.079
Turn around.
Assume this position. Back off!

15:55.162 --> 15:57.873
(groaning) Illegal search! Illegal search!

15:57.957 --> 16:00.793
This is bogus, man. You can't do this.
I know my rights, I know my rights.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.586
Let me tell you something
about your rights, cupcake.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.714
I own this street. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.549
What's this, chippy? We baking a cake?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.927
Hey, get off me! Get off of me!

16:10.010 --> 16:11.095
Come on! Come on!

16:11.178 --> 16:13.430
You ain't gonna do this to me!
Do it! I want you to!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.849
(gunfire)

16:17.643 --> 16:19.311
Anybody else want a conversation?

16:19.561 --> 16:21.730
I'm waitin'! Come on! Come on!

16:28.237 --> 16:30.072
(laughs)

16:36.537 --> 16:37.705
I never touched her.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.624
She says I did, she's lying.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.379
So how'd she get the bruises?

16:46.046 --> 16:47.214
She's a little clumsy.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.426
Falls around the house sometimes.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.469
I don't think you're getting it, Richard.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.432
You're in real trouble this time.
The judge could put you away for a year.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.683
(scoffs)

16:59.018 --> 17:02.062
You got nothing on me that'll stick,
and we both know it.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.358
It make you feel like a man
beating up on women?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.651
Is that your trip, Richard?

17:08.402 --> 17:10.988
Going after the weakest person
you can find?

17:11.905 --> 17:13.532
Nobody touches her but me.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.452
She knows that better than anybody.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.955
You leave us alone. I'll work it out.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.375
-(knocking)
-Yeah?

17:23.459 --> 17:24.460
(door opens)

17:24.543 --> 17:26.670
I'm sorry. I got lost.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.548
I was halfway to Europe
by the time I realized it.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.468
Marty Rodrigues, Public Defender's Office.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.012
-HENRY: Lieutenant Goldblume.
-I usually work South Ferry.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.724
Lieutenant, can I get a moment
with my client, please?

17:40.684 --> 17:42.686
I'd like a word with you
when you're done, yeah?

17:42.770 --> 17:43.771
You got it.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.820
-(coins jangling)
-(beeping)

17:54.698 --> 17:58.160
-Easy, Lieutenant.
-The damn thing doesn't work.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.871
Are you sure
you put in the correct amount?

18:00.954 --> 18:01.955
Yes, I'm sure.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.667
Well, maybe you inadvertently used
Canadian coinage.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.961
Phil, whose side are you on?
This is a machine.

18:08.045 --> 18:13.133
Henry, this machine culminates
four decades of vending science.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.262
I'm sure the problem
is attributable to human error.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.349
"Open the pod door, HAL."

18:25.020 --> 18:27.356
Well, it sounds as if the worst
is behind you, Chief.

18:27.731 --> 18:31.652
Yes, I understand they've modified the
severity of the treatment considerably.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.029
Uh, that's fine too. Yeah, I'm clear.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.406
Something over 200 arrests already.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.827
Yeah. Well, we're thinking
of you too, Chief. Right. Yeah.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.412
-(phone thuds)
-Hi.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.748
Officer McCoy.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.127
-I hope I'm not interrupting.
-Not at all. What brings you to the Hill?

18:48.335 --> 18:50.796
Paperwork, the tie that binds us all.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.756
I wish I could say
I don't know what you mean.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.011
Well, it's nice to see you again.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.347
It's nice to see you, too.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.309
Well, I should get back to the wars.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.520
Right.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.063
Thanks for stopping by.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.150
Sure. It was good to see you.

19:15.863 --> 19:16.822
Captain?

19:18.198 --> 19:21.034
-Do you bowl?
-Bowl? No.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.873
Me neither.
Do you like going to the movies?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.167
I, uh... I used to.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.003
I don't know. I really hate the lines.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.548
I know exactly how you feel.
I feel the same way.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.842
Most of what you see
isn't worth the effort.

19:36.925 --> 19:41.054
Um, are you an opera buff, by any chance?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.973
It's funny.
My mother used to listen all the time,

19:43.056 --> 19:45.434
and it drives me absolutely crazy.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.685
Me too.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.439
I could tell that we have a lot in common.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.648
(chuckles)

19:52.691 --> 19:54.610
How about I buy you a drink later?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.571
-Oh. (chuckles)
-I don't drink.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.409
Well, there's got to be something
that we both enjoy doing.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.496
-I like to eat.
-Maybe we should have dinner.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.290
I'd like that.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.877
-How's tonight?
-Tonight would be good.

20:14.379 --> 20:18.342
Phil, I'm seriously considering
putting him back in private school.

20:18.717 --> 20:22.012
I never had to worry about anything
like this happening there.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.183
You know, yesterday he was so frightened,

20:26.266 --> 20:28.352
he hid behind the auditorium
all during lunch.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.648
Frank Jr.'s a bit small for his age,
isn't he, Fay?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.483
Small? Well, so what?

20:35.067 --> 20:38.111
Oh, well, what I meant is,
that's part of what

20:38.195 --> 20:41.657
makes him a target
for the bully contingent.

20:42.407 --> 20:46.453
Has he had any acquaintance
with the manly arts?

20:46.828 --> 20:47.788
Dating?

20:48.163 --> 20:50.040
No, boxing.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.752
Oh. No. No. Well, I don't think so.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.463
You see, the nature of young men
being what it is, Fay,

20:56.546 --> 20:59.132
I've always believed
that a boy ought to have

20:59.216 --> 21:02.135
some grounding in the rudiments
of self-defense

21:02.219 --> 21:04.137
for situations just such as this.

21:04.638 --> 21:08.809
Now, if you'd like, I'd be more than happy
to come over and tutor him

21:08.892 --> 21:10.936
in a few of the fundamentals.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.941
You know, I used to coach
the precinct's boxing team.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.027
Gee, (stammers) I don't know, Phil. Um...

21:19.111 --> 21:21.071
-FRANK: Ready, Fay?
-Yeah.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.366
Listen, thank you anyway.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.743
Gone about an hour, Phil.

21:27.911 --> 21:30.330
Are you gonna keep your temper
in this meeting, Fay?

21:30.414 --> 21:33.083
Contrary to what you may think,
when it's called for,

21:33.166 --> 21:36.128
I am perfectly capable of self-restraint.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.548
And if that little bully of yours
doesn't lay off of my son,

21:39.631 --> 21:41.675
I'm gonna give him
the spanking he deserves!

21:41.758 --> 21:42.926
Wait. Wait a minute.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.305
And if that doesn't help,
my ex-husband here is a cop.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.222
Fay.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.476
Mrs. Furillo, I don't think there's
anything to be gained by making threats.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.936
Well, excuse me,

21:53.395 --> 21:56.315
but I just thought being the parents
of a shakedown artist,

21:56.398 --> 21:58.108
that's the kind of talk they'd understand.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.694
-You wanna deal with this, please?
-My son is no shakedown artist!

22:00.777 --> 22:02.154
I called this meeting

22:02.237 --> 22:05.449
to try to come to some sort of an
understanding among the parents.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.118
Both as to what the facts
of the situation are--

22:08.201 --> 22:10.787
The facts of the situation are...

22:10.871 --> 22:14.624
that my son is out his lunch money,
and he's afraid to go to school.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.711
Hey, lady, will you please
stop running your mouth?

22:17.794 --> 22:21.131
-Mr., uh, Davis. Is that your name?
-That's correct.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.593
Uh, I'd appreciate you're not addressing
my wife in that tone of voice.

22:24.968 --> 22:28.180
I would like to establish
the facts of this situation,

22:28.263 --> 22:30.390
and then decide how best to solve it.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.184
I told you what the facts are.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.479
Their son is some kind
of a junior hoodlum.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.940
Well, you're some kind
of a senior fat-mouth.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.860
Mr. Davis, this is the last time
I'm going to ask you nicely.

22:41.943 --> 22:43.570
Can we please--

22:43.653 --> 22:46.948
Well, wait, what do you expect
with her calling our son a criminal?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.575
FRANK: From what I understand,

22:48.658 --> 22:50.911
her description of your son's
behavior is pretty accurate.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.455
Oh, is that right?

22:53.997 --> 22:57.209
Who are you? Thurgood Marshall?

22:57.292 --> 22:59.503
Look, pal, I've been trying
to be polite about this,

22:59.586 --> 23:02.381
but, frankly, I don't even know
what Mrs. Furillo and I are doing here.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.424
My son's a victim, not a perpetrator.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.844
-Who you callin' a perpetrator?
-Gentlemen, please.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.264
This is not what I call
initiating a dialog.

23:11.723 --> 23:15.519
Now, can we just try,
try to ascertain the facts?

23:20.649 --> 23:22.692
(chattering)

23:26.238 --> 23:30.075
WOMAN: Someone's in there!
On the fourth floor!

23:30.158 --> 23:33.662
Please, help me! Help me get him out!

23:33.745 --> 23:36.123
Oh, Mama, look down on me now.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.250
WOMAN: Help! Help!

23:38.333 --> 23:40.252
-MAN: Help!
-WOMAN: Help!

23:40.335 --> 23:42.462
-(woman screams)
-MAN: Help!

23:42.546 --> 23:43.505
Help!

23:43.588 --> 23:45.090
There are more people inside!
Somebody help!

23:45.173 --> 23:46.258
There's a policeman.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.428
There's an old man up there.
His wife can't get him out.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.972
-Hurry, please!
-(glass breaking)

23:52.055 --> 23:54.808
All right, ma'am,
hold this and call this in. Call it in!

23:54.891 --> 23:57.644
-All right.
-They're on the second floor. Hurry!

23:57.727 --> 23:59.896
I can't get him out! I can't!

23:59.980 --> 24:01.857
(coughing)

24:01.940 --> 24:04.192
-Get out!
-(coughing)

24:06.236 --> 24:08.405
-(woman coughing)
-Ma'am, I'm outside this door!

24:08.488 --> 24:10.532
I'm gonna kick it, so stand clear!

24:11.616 --> 24:13.702
WOMAN: Oh, thank God.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.787
(coughing)

24:15.871 --> 24:17.998
Oh, you're gonna be all right.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.209
(people shouting)

24:23.712 --> 24:25.714
(coughing)

24:31.553 --> 24:33.263
WOMAN: Oh, they got him out!

24:33.346 --> 24:35.474
(woman coughing)

24:35.557 --> 24:38.643
(woman shouting in Spanish)

24:40.437 --> 24:43.440
(talks in Spanish)

24:43.523 --> 24:45.108
In English, in English!

24:45.192 --> 24:48.778
My little boy upstairs. Please! Miguel!

24:49.029 --> 24:51.239
Third floor, third floor!

24:52.532 --> 24:55.243
-(siren wailing)
-(people shouting)

25:00.290 --> 25:02.167
(coughing)

25:04.044 --> 25:05.712
Where are you, boy?

25:05.795 --> 25:08.298
I'm about to burn up in here. Miguel!

25:08.381 --> 25:10.300
(groans)

25:20.352 --> 25:21.561
Boy!

25:21.645 --> 25:23.730
(shouts in Spanish)

25:23.813 --> 25:26.858
(boy crying) Help! Help! Help!

25:26.942 --> 25:30.320
(crying continues)

25:30.779 --> 25:31.905
Boy!

25:33.907 --> 25:35.700
It's okay, boy. Come on.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.370
-(people shouting)
-WOMAN: There's a cop in there.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.748
He went after the boy.
He's been in there a long time.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.875
(explosion)

25:46.127 --> 25:49.381
-MAN 1: The whole building might blow up!
-(clamoring)

25:49.673 --> 25:52.384
MAN 2: Where is the fire trucks?

25:52.467 --> 25:55.136
BOY: Mom, look! There he is!

25:58.348 --> 26:00.225
(boy coughs)

26:15.782 --> 26:18.326
-Oh, there he is.
-Congratulations.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.453
-Way to go, babe.
-Good for you.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.331
-I heard about the kid.
-Cowboy, good job.

26:23.415 --> 26:27.877
Renko, the captain wanted to
see you as soon as you came in.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.630
-In his office?
-Mm-hmm.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.217
Andy, nicely done.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.094
Thank you, Sarge.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.557
Hey, Sarge, uh, did I get any messages?

26:40.640 --> 26:44.227
Yes, you did.
Detective Benedetto from Midtown.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.605
Thanks.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.487
Excuse me, Captain, sir.
The sergeant says you want to see me.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.491
Come on in. How's the burn?

26:58.575 --> 27:01.620
Well, (stammers) it's okay.
I'm just... I'm real tired.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.914
You'll be back on motor patrol
with Officer Hill starting tomorrow.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.375
Thank you, sir.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.670
I'm also recommending you
for the Meritorious Service Medal.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.840
You did a fine job out there.
I'm proud of you.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.428
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate this very much.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.429
I'm very grateful.

27:19.929 --> 27:20.930
Uh...

27:21.681 --> 27:24.142
Why don't you just take
the rest of the day off, okay?

27:24.476 --> 27:27.354
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

27:31.733 --> 27:35.195
If you could,
tell Benedetto I'll be at Mulligans.

27:35.278 --> 27:38.698
I'd like for him to meet me
there anytime after 7:00.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.783
Yeah.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.869
And tell him, tell him I'll be
waitin' for him.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.497
That's right. Thanks.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.291
In what? In cold blood?

27:50.085 --> 27:53.254
And... And just left him lying there? Hmm?

27:53.672 --> 27:56.549
No. No, no.
I don't know anything about it.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.427
Uh, yeah.
Well, I'll look into it personally.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.595
Yeah, I will.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.723
Uh, no, no. Thanks for the call.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.850
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, Francis?

28:06.810 --> 28:11.731
A woman says that one of our guys
shot a junkie out on the block sweep.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.526
Well, it appears a pair of our detectives

28:14.609 --> 28:17.028
were involved
in a bit of "street theater,"

28:17.112 --> 28:22.492
and, uh, in their thespian exuberance,
got somewhat carried away.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.411
A couple of our detectives?

28:24.703 --> 28:27.872
Yes. John LaRue shot Neal Washington.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.167
Phil, I won't have anarchy out there.

28:31.251 --> 28:34.212
Your activities on this block
will henceforth be monitored

28:34.295 --> 28:38.091
with the scrupulousness that Othello
brought to bear on Desdemona.

28:38.174 --> 28:42.262
You will be wearing our attention
like a pair of stolen jeans.

28:42.762 --> 28:45.974
Fourteen bucks?
What kind of a criminal are you, huh?

28:46.057 --> 28:48.935
You know, one thing I can't stand
is somebody who's lousy at what they do.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.104
-J.D., a minute?
-Yeah. Jack.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.776
We really got their little tails
motating today, Captain.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.528
I hear you killed your partner today.

28:58.611 --> 29:01.072
-Oh, yeah, yeah. A little street theater.
-I see.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.324
And what do you call it
when a suspect thinks you're so crazy

29:03.408 --> 29:05.201
he shoots you before you shoot him?

29:06.494 --> 29:10.707
All will be recorded,
and all will be held against you.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.001
Webster, will you-- (sighs)

29:13.084 --> 29:16.421
There is someone watering
the chain-link in your sector.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.422
Howard.

29:17.505 --> 29:18.506
Howard.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.385
Take half an hour if you need it,
but bring in your men and shut it down.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.889
-Shut what down?
-Operation Big Broom. It's over.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.600
-Frank, you can't--
-However you do it is up to you.

29:28.683 --> 29:31.811
Keep anybody you have a felony
or warrant on and release the others.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.064
-By whose authority?
-By mine. That's an order.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.025
Just empty the buses,
take down the barricades,

29:37.108 --> 29:38.818
and let 'em go, now.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.404
MAN: Come over here
and stay by this fence.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.838
Counselor, I was hoping to speak
with you at the station house.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.217
I'm sorry. I've been running late all day.
What's on your mind?

30:02.759 --> 30:05.136
Before we go in with this,
I just want you to know,

30:05.220 --> 30:09.432
I think it'd be a genuine disservice
if we handle this case by the numbers.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.184
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

30:12.602 --> 30:16.523
I think there's more going on here than
just a sloppy end to a bad relationship.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.650
This woman is genuinely
terrified of the guy,

30:18.733 --> 30:20.819
and I think she may
have good reason to be.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.071
Well, my client's got his side too,
you know.

30:24.113 --> 30:27.033
And he thinks she's a real loony tune.
I mean, who can say?

30:28.284 --> 30:29.244
All the more reason

30:29.327 --> 30:31.329
not to let this slip through the cracks,
don't you think?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.833
Lieutenant, I appreciate your concern,

30:35.375 --> 30:38.878
but I can't very well not represent
my client's interest here.

30:38.962 --> 30:43.007
If there's just some way
to keep him away from her for a few days.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.052
Look, we both got jobs to do.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.555
Why don't we just do 'em? All right?

30:49.305 --> 30:51.516
Excuse me. I have to go find my client.

30:51.599 --> 30:52.684
(elevator dings)

30:53.893 --> 30:58.523
Regarding cases N396-511

30:58.606 --> 31:02.193
through cases N396-517,

31:03.987 --> 31:05.363
Mr. District Attorney,

31:06.656 --> 31:11.452
this is the fifth batch
of pedestrian traffic obstructors

31:11.536 --> 31:13.329
you have brought forward today.

31:13.413 --> 31:17.625
Now, at the risk of sounding
like a broken record,

31:18.459 --> 31:22.380
I would like to say that none of these
charges will hold water in a monsoon.

31:22.463 --> 31:26.593
Defendants' constitutional
guarantees are trampled

31:26.676 --> 31:28.469
practically beyond recognition.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.723
We've had to turn around
half the traffic courts

31:31.806 --> 31:33.308
for this "major" crime wave.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.895
The backup is even starting
to affect the plumbing.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.983
So, uh, it shouldn't come
as a great surprise, sir,

31:42.066 --> 31:46.529
that I have to again
find in favor of the defendants.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.239
-Cases dismissed.
-MAN: All right!

31:48.323 --> 31:52.243
What are we doin' here
in the first place? You hump.

31:52.911 --> 31:57.749
You button your lip, sir, or in your case,
I'll happily make an exception.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.711
-Next case.
-(gavel bangs)

32:04.297 --> 32:08.176
MAN: Case number N396-518 on the calendar.

32:08.384 --> 32:12.221
Richard Brady,
charged with 120.06 of the penal code,

32:12.305 --> 32:13.640
misdemeanor assault.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.191
(sighs) ADA Baxter?

32:23.274 --> 32:27.904
Your Honor, this applies
to a situation between former cohabitants,

32:27.987 --> 32:31.741
in which defendant has consistently
harassed the complainant,

32:31.824 --> 32:33.451
culminating in an assault
which took place--

32:33.534 --> 32:36.454
Wait a second.
Will the counsel approach the bench.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.333
Your Honor,
may I approach the bench as well?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.919
Step forward, Detective.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.885
JUDGE: What are we looking at here?

32:50.969 --> 32:54.764
Why is this anything more than the most
routine domestic squabble?

32:54.847 --> 32:56.933
Your Honor, I think your
instincts are on the mark.

32:57.016 --> 33:00.603
A 50-50 proposition.
They have both been a little intransigent.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.981
My client's record
is completely unblemished.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.816
He's a mechanic, apparently good at it.

33:05.149 --> 33:08.319
Prosecution in this instance
is just gonna cost him grievous injury.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.487
Excuse me, Judge,

33:09.946 --> 33:12.073
it's my gut reaction that we are dealing

33:12.156 --> 33:14.450
with a seriously disturbed individual here

33:14.534 --> 33:17.120
who has already caused
this woman "grievous injury,"

33:17.203 --> 33:20.915
fully capable of more extreme
and unpredictable violence against her.

33:21.249 --> 33:25.169
In all due respect
to your gut, Lieutenant,

33:25.670 --> 33:28.131
there is a familiar pattern here,
in my experience.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.758
And I think I do know
(stammers) my domestics.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.010
Then set bail.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.639
If you can hold it over him in any way,
I beg you not to dismiss.

33:37.056 --> 33:40.351
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I have no intention of dismissing.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.562
(clears throat)

33:42.645 --> 33:45.523
-Please take your seats.
-Thank you.

33:50.236 --> 33:53.114
JUDGE: Mr. Brady, I am on to you, sir.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.243
Be advised, I am placing
a restraining order on you.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.579
I am setting a date for a hearing,

34:00.455 --> 34:03.124
and I am going to be watching
your every move.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.127
And if you do anything
between now and that date,

34:06.210 --> 34:10.006
if I hear one word
of complaint from Miss Hicks

34:10.798 --> 34:12.633
or you go anywhere near that woman,

34:13.384 --> 34:17.889
I am going to throw you into jail
and hold this over you indefinitely.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.266
Now, this is outrageous conduct.

34:21.100 --> 34:25.688
And it's only your lack of criminal record
that I don't take that step now.

34:26.439 --> 34:27.440
All right.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.359
Counsel will advise you
of the hearing date.

34:30.777 --> 34:35.114
And until then, sir,
I want you to walk the line.

34:37.450 --> 34:39.160
Do I hear bail application?

34:39.619 --> 34:42.080
BAXTER: Your Honor, People ask
a thousand dollars.

34:42.538 --> 34:43.456
Defense?

34:43.539 --> 34:45.917
O.R., Your Honor.
Defendant is a working man.

34:46.209 --> 34:48.461
Well, I'm setting this for a long date.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.006
Defendant is excused
on his own recognizance.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.134
And don't you forget one
word I told you, young man.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.137
-Next case.
-(gavel bangs)

35:04.018 --> 35:07.021
-What does this mean?
-He's setting a date for a hearing.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.066
You mean, what--
But wait, you mean they're letting him go?

35:10.149 --> 35:12.777
No, just until the hearing.
He didn't dismiss the charges.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.736
Mary--

35:13.820 --> 35:14.821
Are you just letting him walk out of here?

35:14.904 --> 35:16.656
I can't believe this! Please!

35:16.739 --> 35:20.034
Your counsel will outline
the particulars, ma'am.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.829
Wait a minute!
You can't just let him walk out of here!

35:22.912 --> 35:25.039
He's gonna kill me!
What's the matter with you?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.959
-I don't believe this!
-Counsel, will you restrain your client?

35:28.042 --> 35:30.628
-Mary, please. Come on.
-No! Let go of me!

35:30.711 --> 35:33.589
You're... You're just worthless!
You're all worthless!

35:35.174 --> 35:36.467
-Let me drive you home.
-Don't touch me!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.219
Don't you dare touch me!

35:43.599 --> 35:45.893
(gavel bangs)

35:48.938 --> 35:50.940
HOWARD: We have two hours left in the day.

35:51.023 --> 35:55.194
We have precisely the kind
of results in hand

35:55.278 --> 35:58.364
that this operation
was intended to produce.

35:58.447 --> 35:59.907
Enter our captain.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.660
Exit the rug beneath our feet.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.621
-I did what I felt I had to do.
-It was a public embarrassment.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.331
-That certainly wasn't my intention.
-(sighs)

36:07.415 --> 36:11.961
Frank,<i> mano a mano,</i>
you will always have my respect,

36:12.420 --> 36:15.256
but I have to say
that your official conduct today

36:15.339 --> 36:19.594
has been incomprehensible
and deeply disappointing.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.637
I'm sorry you feel that way, Howard.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.599
Goldarn it, Frank, I hate to say this,

36:25.558 --> 36:30.354
but it seems to this old warhorse
that all your starch is in your shirt.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.945
I want a moment with your captain.

36:42.658 --> 36:45.661
(door opens, closes)

36:47.538 --> 36:50.416
I suppose I shouldn't really be surprised.

36:51.334 --> 36:54.545
It's just that I keep thinking
you've turned the corner.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.880
What's on your mind, Chief?

36:55.963 --> 36:57.840
(exhales)

36:57.924 --> 37:01.761
I consider what you did out there
nothing less than a personal betrayal.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.721
That operation came
straight from the mayor.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.015
It had my own unqualified support.

37:06.098 --> 37:09.185
Not only have you compromised
the entire chain of command,

37:09.644 --> 37:13.814
you've opened this department to the worst
kind of media second-guessing.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.026
What the hell is the matter with you?

37:17.109 --> 37:18.945
I felt things had gone too far.
There were--

37:19.028 --> 37:20.363
You felt!

37:22.865 --> 37:27.078
This is not sensitivity training, Captain.
I don't care what you felt!

37:27.161 --> 37:29.205
We were taking liberties with their rights

37:29.288 --> 37:32.041
-that I couldn't, in good conscience--
-Where is it written...

37:33.626 --> 37:36.879
that you need to agree
with every order you're given?

37:39.674 --> 37:41.634
I happen to be in the middle

37:42.218 --> 37:45.388
of an extremely painful course
of medical treatment.

37:45.972 --> 37:50.309
You think I have nothing better to do
than clean up after your bleeding heart?

37:52.520 --> 37:55.439
Tomorrow morning, same time,

37:56.399 --> 37:58.359
you're going to run that operation again.

37:59.360 --> 38:03.406
And you're going to keep on running it
until I say it's over.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.409
-Am I understood?
-Yes.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.253
Aren't you going to offer me
your badge, Captain?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.219
(door closes)

38:26.512 --> 38:29.890
(humming)

38:29.974 --> 38:32.601
(beeping)

38:32.685 --> 38:36.772
Hey, you looking at me? Huh?

38:37.565 --> 38:40.151
Huh? Huh? You looking at me?

38:40.234 --> 38:43.237
Say what? Huh?

38:44.071 --> 38:45.740
(beeps)

38:45.823 --> 38:47.450
Oh, yeah, yeah!

38:47.533 --> 38:51.203
Easy! Ooh.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.749
Furley, will you take this
from me, please?

38:54.832 --> 38:56.834
Henry. Phone for you.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.127
(clears throat)

38:58.586 --> 38:59.795
Lieutenant Goldblume.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.637
Yeah.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.143
Thank you.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.773
(phone thuds)

39:41.587 --> 39:44.256
We got witnesses say she was
coming out with a suitcase.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.967
He just came at her and started slashing.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.397
(phone rings)

39:59.480 --> 40:00.606
Belker.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.192
Hi, Ma.

40:05.277 --> 40:08.114
No, I couldn't go last night, Ma.
I had to work late.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.117
I'm going right after work.

40:14.120 --> 40:18.582
Ma, if he's throwing fruit at the nurses,
so you don't take him any more fruit.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.088
Right, especially canned.

40:25.714 --> 40:27.299
I'm going tonight.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.760
I told you, right after work.

40:29.844 --> 40:30.928
As a matter of fact,

40:31.011 --> 40:33.806
if I wasn't on the phone,
I'd be on my way right now, Ma.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.935
I'll kiss him for you.

40:39.895 --> 40:43.566
Well, I love you too. Goodbye.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.863
-Hi, Mick.
-Hi.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.531
How's it goin'?

40:51.115 --> 40:54.034
-Okay.
-Feel like a beer and a burger?

40:54.785 --> 40:56.829
No, I can't. I gotta go see my father.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.372
Want some company?

40:59.039 --> 41:02.251
-No, thanks.
-I could sit in the car.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.796
-We could go out after.
-Would you want to do that?

41:06.297 --> 41:07.214
Got a radio?

41:07.673 --> 41:10.384
-Cop radio.
-So I'll listen to cop calls.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.721
-Okay.
-Give me a minute to change.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.767
The kid looked so happy, Frank.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.687
He looked so satisfied,

41:22.813 --> 41:24.899
this poor girl lying there.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.990
I don't know what to tell you, Henry.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.244
We'd do better off running a restaurant.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.498
We'd do more damn good.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.003
Pizza joint.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.340
With a deli counter.

41:54.094 --> 41:55.095
"Furblume's."

41:58.974 --> 42:00.100
"Goldillo's"?

42:00.184 --> 42:02.353
-"Frank and Henry's."
-Bingo.

42:04.688 --> 42:05.731
(sighs)

42:08.859 --> 42:11.904
Uh, I'll grow one of those
pencil mustaches.

42:12.821 --> 42:13.781
(chuckles)

42:14.865 --> 42:16.116
<i>Mangia, </i>Frankie.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.122
I'd make that bastard a poison pizza.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.386
Oh, Francis.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.097
Look what I found
from our old P.A.L. tournaments.

42:38.806 --> 42:42.017
-What were you looking for, Phil?
-Well, these.

42:42.685 --> 42:43.852
(chuckles)

42:43.936 --> 42:47.147
I thought, with your leave,
I might swing by Fay's tonight

42:47.231 --> 42:50.693
and instruct young Frank
in some pugilistic fundamentals.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.444
Oh, I don't know, Phil.

42:54.071 --> 42:58.033
I gathered your meeting with the other
boy's father left matters unresolved.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.952
We behaved like any two apes.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.788
Francis, I'm certainly
not trying to tell you your business,

43:02.871 --> 43:05.165
but if I had a son
in Frank Jr.'s situation,

43:05.583 --> 43:08.586
I'd want him to be able to defend himself
in a way that would discourage

43:08.669 --> 43:11.589
this kind of treatment
in no uncertain terms.

43:12.172 --> 43:15.259
And a good left jab can give a boy
the confidence he needs

43:15.342 --> 43:16.677
to see this through.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.139
You may be right, Phil.

43:20.973 --> 43:24.810
You know, a man has to draw
the line somewhere, Francis,

43:25.352 --> 43:26.729
even if he's nine.

43:36.905 --> 43:40.159
Excuse me, Mr. Furillo,
there is a phone call for you.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.995
You're telling me I'm over
the limit on my card, right?

43:43.412 --> 43:47.124
-Yes, sir. That is correct.
-Um, how about we go Dutch?

43:47.207 --> 43:48.834
Oh, no. No problem.

43:53.213 --> 43:54.256
Thank you.

43:55.507 --> 43:56.508
Thank you, sir.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.929
How did you know
there wasn't a phone call?

44:01.013 --> 44:03.849
-No one's calling me. I have a beeper.
-Oh.

44:04.308 --> 44:08.437
-I hate it when they do that to you.
-He's working the wrong crowd.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.814
I used up my blushes a long time ago.

44:11.982 --> 44:12.983
(clears throat)

44:13.233 --> 44:14.318
Frank...

44:15.653 --> 44:18.530
I've really enjoyed getting to know you.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.451
-Um...
-Thank you.

44:22.743 --> 44:27.373
Well, it's not really that I know you.
It's I know that you're something special.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.875
Does that seem forward?

44:30.918 --> 44:34.129
No, not at all. It's a lovely compliment.
You're pretty special yourself.

44:35.297 --> 44:38.717
I hope your lady friend
appreciates what she's got.

44:40.469 --> 44:42.471
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

44:44.098 --> 44:47.142
Just how heavy-duty is this relationship?

44:48.519 --> 44:49.812
Pretty heavy-duty.

44:51.730 --> 44:53.357
Then what are we doing out?

44:53.649 --> 44:56.068
(clears throat)
She's in Washington interviewing for a job

44:56.151 --> 44:57.611
which I'm sure they'll offer her.

44:59.071 --> 45:01.365
And what will that mean for you?

45:02.366 --> 45:04.159
I don't know.
I don't know if she'll take it.

45:04.243 --> 45:05.411
What if she does?

45:08.288 --> 45:10.082
It's true, isn't it?

45:11.125 --> 45:13.460
Timing really is everything.

45:16.755 --> 45:18.215
Frank, um...

45:20.926 --> 45:25.264
at the very least, no matter what happens,
I hope that we're gonna be friends.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.224
I think you can count on it.

45:29.685 --> 45:32.479
(upbeat music playing)

45:42.573 --> 45:43.699
You're Hill.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.204
Benedetto.

45:50.539 --> 45:53.083
Your messages are clogging up my desk.

45:54.042 --> 45:55.169
Do we have a problem?

46:01.300 --> 46:02.843
You know my partner.

46:04.428 --> 46:05.637
The smart mouth?

46:07.181 --> 46:09.725
How's his scooter? (chuckles)

46:09.808 --> 46:11.351
How's his face?

46:13.020 --> 46:14.563
(chuckles)

46:15.314 --> 46:16.815
Now you want a piece, too?

46:19.526 --> 46:21.612
You're not as stupid as you look.

46:24.656 --> 46:26.074
(glass slams on bar)

46:28.118 --> 46:29.578
(grunting)

46:36.210 --> 46:37.795
What's the matter, Sal, huh?

46:37.878 --> 46:39.588
You can't hit someone
standing in front of you?

46:39.671 --> 46:41.465
-Come on, Sal, huh?
-(grunts)

46:41.548 --> 46:44.593
(groaning)

46:45.969 --> 46:48.388
Come on, Sal! Come on, Sal.

46:48.472 --> 46:51.183
What you want me to do?
Turn my back on you, Sal? Come on, Sal.

46:51.266 --> 46:53.060
(grunting)

46:55.979 --> 46:57.689
You done, Sal? Huh?

46:58.690 --> 46:59.691
Done.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.445
Yeah, we're done.

47:28.887 --> 47:29.805
(clears throat)

47:30.138 --> 47:30.973
Uh, hello?

47:31.056 --> 47:33.851
Yeah, operator, would you ring
Joyce Davenport's room, please?

47:34.893 --> 47:36.061
Davenport. Yeah.

47:38.522 --> 47:41.567
I'm sure she's a guest there, operator.
Would you check your reservations?

47:43.110 --> 47:44.820
Joyce Davenport. That's correct.

47:49.616 --> 47:51.910
She never checked in? You sure?

47:55.581 --> 47:58.458
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

47:58.959 --> 47:59.960
No.

48:00.878 --> 48:04.923
Uh, would you ring, uh, Clark Galloway's--

48:05.007 --> 48:05.966
Uh, never mind.

48:06.425 --> 48:09.177
Operator? Yeah, no.

48:09.845 --> 48:10.679
No, never mind.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.265
Yeah, thanks very much.

48:15.183 --> 48:16.018
(phone clicks)

48:24.151 --> 48:26.528
(closing theme playing)
