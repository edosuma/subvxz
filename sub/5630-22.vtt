      - Last time I worked
    violence reduction duty

00:04.171 --> 00:06.405
 I wound up chasing some tweaked
     out Bonnie and Clyde couple

00:06.407 --> 00:07.740
        across a roof--
   - Right, the ones who fell

00:07.742 --> 00:09.074

00:09.076 --> 00:11.243

            - Yeah.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.678
                     - Point is,
                  we just became

00:12.680 --> 00:14.246
                two more targets
           for them to shoot at.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.315
- A: Platt basically
made this mandatory.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.318
B: We're getting overtime.
It's, like, a dollar a minute.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.353
         - Time I'd rather spend
          in that walk-in shower

00:21.355 --> 00:23.455
       with the dual steam heads
   in the apartment I looked at.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.457
           - Uh-huh.

               and the whatever,

00:42.043 --> 00:44.143

              next to the stove?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.145
  You are not moving in there.
        - It's intimate.

                       For what?

02:46.266 --> 02:47.599

02:47.601 --> 02:48.901
      - Yeah, I think so.

02:48.903 --> 02:52.571

She's just saying random words.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.608

02:56.610 --> 02:57.943
                           Fine.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.778
  They're gonna take her to Med.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.584
                  Work the case.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.953
    - Yeah, show me inside.
            - Yeah.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.765
  - Where was the little girl?

03:20.967 --> 03:24.970
- Crawled out from
underneath her older sister.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.505
Played dead.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.874
The offender
must have missed her.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.943
And there's no safe
in the house anywhere,

03:30.945 --> 03:33.946
so if this was a robbery,
it went way wrong.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.714
              - Cases like this,
                 it's never who,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.716
                it's always why.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.888
- I'm Jerome Dougherty.
This is my son, Gerald.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.290
- You were on Neighborhood Watch
   when you heard the shots?

03:45.292 --> 03:46.758
- Yeah, two blocks west
on Canal Street.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.694
       I heard the shots.
        Maybe two dozen.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.962
   Sounded like a semi-auto.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.763
      - You trained on handguns?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.398
- We're both
tactically certified.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.701
     - Do you all carry weapons?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.536
        - Some of us do.
            - Okay.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.471
- A lot of strangers moving in.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.840
I'm liberal and all, but, like,

04:01.842 --> 04:03.408
they don't get it.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.278
        - It used to be
     a family neighborhood

04:06.280 --> 04:09.448
    till they started moving
  all the Section 8 people in.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.383
                 - They assigned
     Violence Reduction patrols.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.551
    Doing what we can to fix it.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.853
- And what do you think,
Officer?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.755
It working?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.560
If anyone from the Watch
saw anything,

04:21.562 --> 04:22.861
we'll loop you in.

04:22.863 --> 04:23.996
            - Here.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.499
      - Thank you for your time.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.337
- Unlock your elbow, man.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.472
  - I'm not locking my elbow.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.375
- I'm watching you
lock your elbow.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.311
 - Look, perfect medial rotation
                     every time.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.445
        I'm like the Terminator.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.713
         - Yeah, right.
       - Hey, Patrolman.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.649
Oh, looks like you're
locking your elbow, huh?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.050
                          - See?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.752
         - I got a bullet lodged
               3/8ths of an inch

04:46.754 --> 04:48.320
         into my scalene tissue,
                       Sergeant.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.322
- Yeah, I know.
You're the original tough guy.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.657
       - What're you doing here?

04:51.659 --> 04:52.991
- Look who I brought.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.328
    Burgess, what the hell?
 - Sorry, the door was tricky.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.030
  Hey, we brought you a card.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.965
         - I see that.
       - Uh, to be clear,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.867
this is not a get-well card.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.002
It is a see-you-soon card,

05:04.004 --> 05:05.837
'cause I got you
on the A&A sheets

05:05.839 --> 05:07.339
for light duty
starting next week.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.940
     - Ah, they still gotta
    dig these fragments out.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.543
- Oh, did you get shot?
You haven't mentioned it once.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.878
            - Ha ha.
        I got a meeting

05:12.880 --> 05:14.980
 with the medical board at 5:00
  to get the surgery approved,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.448
             so...
            - Good.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.084
Easy peasy--Doc patches you up,
you're back on patrol

05:19.086 --> 05:20.952
as soon as your
Return to Work form clears.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.721
           All good.
     - And me and Burgess,

05:22.723 --> 05:24.356
              we'll be partners?

05:24.358 --> 05:26.325
- That's kind of
a sticky wicket.

05:26.327 --> 05:30.329
HQ doesn't like the idea beca--
because you were--

05:30.331 --> 05:33.432
 because you know what you were
  at the time of the shooting.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.001
So we have to strategize.
Let's go get some pancakes.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.869
                       [quietly]
                       Let's go.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.973
- All right,
Darren and Jeni Carlson.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.344
Both 48 years old.
Lifelong residents of Chicago.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.612
Both their daughters were
in public high school.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.114
Their son,
he was 10 years old.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.749
                      Tough kid.
                  Beat leukemia.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.784
 Lastly, their daughter, Polly.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.119
She's 12 years old.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.922
She's our only survivor.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.991
    Darren used to work for
 the City Planning Department.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.060
- Jeni was a manager
at a commercial printer.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.029
     They had about a dozen LLCs
                 in their names.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.464
- Yeah, they were definitely
hustlers.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.432
Darren manages
a few rental properties.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.000
I got patrol knocking on doors
right now.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.769
We might just be looking for
an aggravated tenant.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.672
  - Yeah, Jeni was raising money
   to buy a fast food franchise.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.407
                I'm looking into
                their investors.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.844
 They also had a $50,000 advance
 from a company called Horizons.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.412
- Horizons?

06:20.414 --> 06:21.880
That's a pyramid scheme.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.783
They do these seminars
to teach leadership skills,

06:24.785 --> 06:26.952
but it's a total scam.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.621
      - So, we got nothing
 on the pod cameras yet, boss.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.023
       Neighborhood Watch
  didn't see anybody fleeing.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.126
- We got the .40 caliber shells
       left at the scene.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.161
       None of 'em match
the ballistics database so far.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.596
        - So it's either
        a single shooter

06:37.598 --> 06:38.864
    or they only discharged
        the one weapon.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.465
      - There was no sign
        of forced entry,

06:40.467 --> 06:42.467
so they knew who the killer was.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.903
                - It's possible.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.605
               Look, what I want
                to understand is

06:46.607 --> 06:49.541
    who exactly the Carlsons are
               in business with.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.110
     These people are scrambling
    to do right by their family.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.012
       Somewhere along the line,
                    it went bad.

06:54.014 --> 06:57.149
   And let's not assume the kids
     are just collateral damage.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.017
                I mean, they got
          two teenage daughters.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.420
- The surviving daughter
is our only eyeball witness.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.722
She's on a three-day
psych evaluation at Med.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.890
      - Her aunt and uncle

07:04.892 --> 07:06.591
        in St. Louis are
      her closest family.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.993
They're gonna be
on the first flight tomorrow.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.127
            - Polly.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.863
         12 years old.
    Got nobody in the city.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.533
           - Well, she's got us.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.070
            - Change of clothes.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.739
          - Thank you.
   - You need anything else?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.107
             - No.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.546
- To take your mind off.

07:28.748 --> 07:32.083
       Tell me I'm crazy,
  but that is a perfect condo.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.486
Check out that view.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.054
          - Where's the bedroom?

07:36.056 --> 07:38.790
- Did you see the view?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.725
           - There's no bedroom?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.794
- There's a dry cleaner
in the building.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.530
                - You don't know
           what dry cleaning is.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.966
- I'll learn.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.904
I'll wait for Polly.
You get out of here.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.473
           - No, it's all right.
                 I wanna be here

07:54.475 --> 07:55.574
              when she wakes up.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.043
- I know you do, but...

07:58.045 --> 08:01.480
there's such a thing
as having too much empathy.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.815
You leave nothing for yourself.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.484
     - You want me to care less?

08:05.486 --> 08:06.718
- I want you to sleep.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.155
     - I'll sleep when I've done
                   29 and a day.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.793
             Thank you for this.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.667
                 I'll go change.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.670
          <i>[moving music]</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:31.576
               <i>â™ª </i>

08:31.578 --> 08:34.513
- Also noted multiple contusions
          to rib cage

08:34.515 --> 08:36.515
           consistent
    with blunt force trauma.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.083
             - Doc.
            - Hank.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.020
I know you like to be on hand
with tender age victims,

08:42.022 --> 08:44.222
but these kids appear healthy.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.624
Well-nourished.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.593
  - No sign of domestic abuse?
             - No.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.529
Then I run the fluoroscope
on the father.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.230
That's a different story.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.232
Due to lividity,
it was a little tough to see

08:54.234 --> 08:56.535
until we cleaned him up.
Bruising...

08:56.537 --> 08:58.103
 - Yeah, someone put a beating
            on him.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.838
- I think you know
what I'm gonna say next.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.873
              - No record of him
      seeking medical treatment.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.042
- Nada.
Liver isn't shot,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.077
but it's consistent
with his self-medicating.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.179
            - You got a timeline
                 on the beating?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.916
- I'd say three months.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.586
        - Being part of
      the Horizons family

09:14.588 --> 09:16.221
  has made me a better person.

09:16.223 --> 09:20.825
        Before Horizons,
 I was pushing away abundance.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.962
        It was a pattern
   of negative reinforcement.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.166
       Then I remembered
      the Orlando assembly

09:28.168 --> 09:30.802
   and the skills we learned.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.872
                    - Let's step
                   in my office.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.275
      This is great stuff.
          Keep going.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.010
                [woman continues
                  in background]

09:39.012 --> 09:41.646
- Graham Simmons.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.847
This your shop?

09:42.849 --> 09:45.050
                   - Yes and no.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.719
          Have a seat.
- You run Chicago for Horizons.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.988
So what's that make you?
A life coach?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.958
           A priest?
- I'm no different from anyone.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.259
                 How can I help?

09:54.261 --> 09:57.896
         You can imagine this is
  a tough day for our community.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.365
 - Well, kept your doors open.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.336
       They would have wanted us
                to keep pushing.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.906
- They were also paying Horizons
22% interest on a huge loan.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.808
     - Yeah, you gotta love
        a guy like that.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.711
 - I met Darren when he and Jeni

10:12.713 --> 10:15.246
                     were living
        in a van with four kids.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.816
                I brought him in
               and he prospered.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.651
                  Inside a year,
           they were homeowners,

10:19.653 --> 10:22.153
      building a life of purpose
                 for his family.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.689
        Five years later, he was
on our Implementation Committee.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.358
- You prosper,
you pick up enemies.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.393
             - Well, not Darren.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.395
 He put his darkness behind him.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.796
- What darkness?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.198
His record was spotless.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.333
                      - Failure.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.768
                    I don't know
           what Darren was into,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.370
          but it wasn't working.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.271
                  With our help,
            he turned it around.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.140
   - Why'd he need 50 grand?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.743
                   - He achieved
         a new leadership level.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.311
   He was an Emerald Tier Guide.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.313
- He bought a new level
for 50,000.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.881
- Yeah, so you put up the cash,

10:49.883 --> 10:51.750
he's gotta pay you back
by signing in new members.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.953
Well...
I can draw it for you.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.322
Looks a lot like a pyramid.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.825
- We need the name of
every member Darren signed up.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.327
           - I'm happy to answer
                      questions,

11:02.329 --> 11:05.030
      but I won't open our books
             without a subpoena.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.798
         I have responsibilities
                 to our members.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.802
         - Yeah, well,
      you want to help us.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.805
Someone killed your friends
and three of their kids.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.442
Do you understand that?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.246
Which one are you, Graham?

11:21.248 --> 11:22.447
Hmm?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.050
Victim or victor?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.785
- I'm still working to find out.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.087
- Work in progress.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.259
           - Next time you come,
 make sure it's with a subpoena.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.030
                - Polly's awake,
             but she's catatonic

11:39.032 --> 11:40.732
      or one click away from it.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.734
                    - I spoke to
   the Neighborhood Watch again.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.402
                They're helpful.
                    Too helpful.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.337
       I'm afraid they're
   spooking any eye witnesses

11:46.339 --> 11:48.139
       <i>because right now...</i>
     <i>- Polly's the only one</i>

11:48.141 --> 11:49.207
      who saw the shooter.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.909
- We need you in the psych ward,
                            now.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.210
- I gotta go.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.114
         [man groaning]

11:56.116 --> 11:57.415
         - Down there.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.853
          <i>[tense music]</i>

12:01.855 --> 12:03.188
           Get security up here.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.824
       I need one Haldol
 and a gurney with restraints.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.125
             - Wait, wait, wait.
             Let me talk to her.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.359
      - What're you doing?
          - Stay back.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.061
        Clear the hall.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.197
- Clear the hall.
Let's go.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.333
            - Polly?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.336
     - [breathing heavily]

12:20.806 --> 12:22.407
            - Polly.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.477
It's Erin.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.080
Do you remember me?

12:30.182 --> 12:32.851
Can you put the knife down?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.357
Do you know where you are?

12:42.094 --> 12:45.797
             - I...
           [panting]

12:45.799 --> 12:48.066
      I'm at the hospital.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.438
- That's right.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.940
Do you know why?

12:55.942 --> 12:58.977
               - [crying softly]
               I don't know why.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.411
                   I'm not hurt.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.914
                 I need to help.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.518
- Okay, you can help.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.854
You can help me.

13:09.856 --> 13:13.258
But first, I need you
to put the knife down.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.294
And then you can help me, okay?

13:18.330 --> 13:21.166
Can you put it down,
maybe on the floor there?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.334
And then you can help me.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.906
             Okay.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.208
           Thank you.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.310
     Now listen--hey, hey!

13:32.312 --> 13:33.812
             Wait!
           - No, no!

13:33.814 --> 13:35.180
            [yelps]
            - Easy.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.248
         - No, let go!
            - Easy.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.284
             - Wh--
           [grunting]

13:40.352 --> 13:43.421
                        [crying]

13:45.191 --> 13:47.325
- What're you doing?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.027
                       - My job.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.996
              Make sure she gets
                   her own room.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.132
- Polly Carlson
is our only eyewitness,

13:54.134 --> 13:56.134
and you just sedated her again.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.869
                      - She's in
           a dissociative state.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.505
She's not ready to talk to you.
   - Her family was murdered

14:00.507 --> 14:02.373
and you're stalling
my investigation.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.375
 - Detective, she's traumatized.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.611
          She attacked my staff.
     She's not making any sense.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.913
- Every hour that I lose
makes it that much harder

14:08.915 --> 14:10.248
to catch the people
who did this.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.317
Polly said she wanted to help.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.118
What if she can?

14:14.120 --> 14:17.355
I need to interview her.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.357
   - The problem with the police

14:19.359 --> 14:22.560
       is that wherever they go,
  they think they're the police.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.629
                 I will call you
            when I've determined

14:24.631 --> 14:26.598
       that she's ready to talk.
                           Okay?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.234
                      I promise.

14:29.236 --> 14:35.540
- I'm sympathetic
to your situation,

14:35.542 --> 14:37.642
being shot in your squad car.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.178
And while the department's proud
of the way you handled it,

14:40.180 --> 14:43.948
once Roman returns to full duty,
you both get new partners.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.050
- Frankly...

14:46.052 --> 14:47.652
[scoffs]
we came to you as a courtesy.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.654
I want them
in that car together.

14:49.656 --> 14:50.889
They report to me.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.257
- And you report to me.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.958
      - As I explained in court,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.060
            my actions following
           my partner's shooting

14:56.062 --> 14:57.495
  were professional and correct.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.097
- Burgess,
you need to cool down.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.633
- Patrolman,
this isn't the court.

15:01.635 --> 15:04.235
This isn't any kind
of democracy.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.104
It's a tyranny.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.539
And I've made up my mind.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.441
                   - Understood.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.281
- Five murders this morning.
You come in here with this?

15:16.283 --> 15:19.250
          <i>[somber music]</i>

15:19.252 --> 15:22.520
               <i>â™ª </i>

15:22.522 --> 15:24.122
          - Hey, boss?
            - Yeah.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.657
  - So Horizons won't give us
          the members

15:25.659 --> 15:27.692
that Darren sold memberships to.
           - Uh-huh.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.328
  - We had a guy in the Assets
 Forfeiture Unit look into it.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.530
   - Yeah, we got him working
  backwards through the bank.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.232
- The Carlsons signed up
everyone on that list,

15:34.234 --> 15:35.934
and then those people,
they turn around

15:35.936 --> 15:37.368
and sell to the other suckers.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.503
We're thinking
there's a motive there.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.305
    - Yep, and this guy here
          stands out.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.607
          Allan Sloan.
       Sent a few emails.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.076
No death threats, necessarily,
but close enough.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.512
                   - "You people
            cost me everything."

15:47.514 --> 15:49.347
             - And he got popped
     for a drunk and disorderly,

15:49.349 --> 15:50.682
            like, four days ago.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.684
          - All right, find him.
              Get him in a room.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.118
- All right.

15:56.221 --> 15:58.723
- Central, this is
Officer Adam Ruzek.

15:58.725 --> 16:02.126
Hey, we're at 8322 South Shore.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.730
Did you dispatch a unit
to Allan Sloan's house?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.665
     <i>- We got them held down</i>
          <i>on a burglary.</i>

16:07.667 --> 16:10.068
     <i>Should we hold you down</i>
          <i>as assisting?</i>

16:10.070 --> 16:12.303
   - Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah.
          <i>- Copy that.</i>

16:16.709 --> 16:18.476
         - Come on in.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.379
            [scoffs]
    Guess it's a party now.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.749
                      He came in
          through the back door.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.118
              Took the pins out.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.554
      [exhales] Guess this ain't
                his first rodeo.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.123
        Took my tablet computer.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.524
  - So when was the burglary?

16:33.526 --> 16:35.259
                   - Last night.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.996
      I didn't find out about it
             until this morning,

16:37.998 --> 16:39.130
                   to be honest.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.099
- Where were you at 4:00 a.m.?

16:41.101 --> 16:43.267
          - At my brother's bar,

16:43.269 --> 16:46.337
                   and then here
             on this very couch.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.438
            - Okay.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.308
   - Jeni and Darren Carlson.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.011
      - Is that why you're here?
          You think that was me?

16:53.013 --> 16:55.446
     - We read your emails.
Anything you want to talk about?

16:59.485 --> 17:02.520
           So I'm on stage there
         in front of 500 people,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.722
 and they got this head shrinker
         there trying to help me

17:04.723 --> 17:08.126
            "unlock my potential
              to create wealth."

17:08.127 --> 17:11.229
   I mean, I knew at that moment
   that this was total nonsense.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.031
                    So I'm like,
 "Okay, I'm ready for a refund."

17:14.034 --> 17:15.233
                [chuckles wryly]
            Nothing doing there.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.567
- Mr. Sloan,
we're gonna need you

17:16.569 --> 17:19.270
to come down to the District.
We're also gonna need a name...

17:19.271 --> 17:20.637
     - Nah, nah, nah, nah.
  - Of anybody that can verify

17:20.640 --> 17:22.306
your whereabouts last night.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.409
          - [exhales]

17:24.411 --> 17:26.310
           Horizons.

17:26.311 --> 17:29.313
      It never ends, man.
     They take everything.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.483
    - No, I'm still waiting.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.154
                - Ready for you.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.822
- I'll call you back.

17:41.693 --> 17:44.095
- Hi, Polly.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.797
             - Hey.

17:50.502 --> 17:54.672
- So, Polly, you said before
that you wanted to help.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.777
            - Um...

17:59.779 --> 18:02.146
         I saw the man
     who killed my family.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.682
           I just...

18:07.486 --> 18:09.654
     I can't see his face.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.624
- I want you to try.
Okay?

18:15.427 --> 18:18.229
            - Well, I need to go
       to the house on the lake.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.530
        They said I couldn't go.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.365
         - Is that why
      you hurt the nurse?

18:23.135 --> 18:25.736
  - I need to go to the house
          on the lake.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.774
            - Okay.

18:31.343 --> 18:34.278
Well, why don't we go
to the house on the lake?

18:37.516 --> 18:40.151
So, this house...

18:40.153 --> 18:42.120
she could be fixated.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.821
                       You know,
        it's a coping mechanism,

18:43.823 --> 18:46.290
       but the fixation could be
                based in reality

18:46.292 --> 18:47.625
         or it could be entirely
                        fictive.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.227
- Okay, which one
do you think it is?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.729
                 - I don't know.
         You know, if it exists,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.764
           it could be she's got
            some positive memory

18:53.766 --> 18:55.733
      she wants to relive there.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.503
- And that could bring her back
to reality.?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.338
                     - Possibly.
        I mean, I assume you got

19:00.340 --> 19:01.672
         some other leads you're
                working on here.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.609
- Leads, yes.
Witnesses, no.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.678
Listen, about this morning.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.380
I hadn't slept.
I'm sorry.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.781
This is your shop.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.216
I should not tell you
how to run it.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.152
  - Erin, do not worry about it.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.420
         Everybody's just trying
                to do their job.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.756
                 So, this house,
                        you, uh,

19:18.758 --> 19:19.857
            you think it exists?

19:19.859 --> 19:22.426
- I have absolutely no idea,

19:22.428 --> 19:25.196
but if it does,
we're gonna find out.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.399
- At this time,
this medical review board

19:28.401 --> 19:29.834
regrets to inform you

19:29.836 --> 19:31.736
that we will not be able
to approve

19:31.738 --> 19:34.739
the surgical procedure
Dr. Calloway suggests.

19:34.741 --> 19:35.940
- What the hell does that mean?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.475
       You got a problem
        with my doctor?

19:37.477 --> 19:38.843
- It's more complicated
than that.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.880
  - The bullet--it's buried back
         near the C5 nerve root.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.415
      - You said you could
          get it out.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.817
          - And I can,

19:46.819 --> 19:49.520
  but removing it is unlikely
           to improve

19:49.522 --> 19:51.956
 the sensory and motor deficits
          to your arm,

19:51.958 --> 19:54.392
          and, well...

19:54.394 --> 19:56.694
   the surgery could actually
        make them worse.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.364
 - The damage condition is most
 likely going to be permanent.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.433
You can't work patrol
with a chronic condition.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.936
  - I don't have a condition.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.837
              You don't know me.
                Ask my Sergeant.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.307
              Ask the Commander.
    I belong out on the streets.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.708
- You're unable
to use your firearm

20:10.710 --> 20:12.310
or defend yourself physically.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.912
You can't return
to the streets safely.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.581
         - Can this be appealed?

20:16.583 --> 20:21.352
- Son, you gotta think
about your quality of life.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.689
There's a lot of brave men out
there who never got the chance

20:24.691 --> 20:26.424
to do what you're doing--

20:26.426 --> 20:29.327
to walk away from a shooting.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.495
The department will find
something for you

20:31.497 --> 20:33.497
where you can be effective,

20:33.499 --> 20:36.267
and you won't be in danger.

20:36.269 --> 20:43.374
          [door opens]

20:43.376 --> 20:45.343
     - Sloan's alibi checks out.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.012
     His brother and four others
  put him falling off a barstool

20:48.014 --> 20:49.580
     at the time of the murders.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.982
               It's right before
              he was robbed too.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.717
       - Strange timing.
            - Yeah.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.352
     What's even more strange is
        that his neighbor called

20:54.354 --> 20:56.487
            about a car blocking
her handicapped spot last night.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.022
                   - Right after
            the Carlson murders.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.592
Plates belong to
a security consultant employed

21:01.594 --> 21:03.327
      by Horizons International.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.830
               - Yeah, the guy's
   a former Cook County Sheriff.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.832
                 Francis Kruger.
             Pretty big problem.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.800
          Got fired for a couple
          excessive force beefs.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.003
- You see Horizons as the nexus?

21:12.005 --> 21:14.572
- Sloan said that the only thing
       that was taken was

21:14.574 --> 21:16.274
            his tablet computer,
                   which he used

21:16.276 --> 21:17.842
     to film a Horizons seminar.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.011
       Their aggressive tactics,
           et cetera, et cetera.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.712
- I mean, I think we got motive.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.847
       Sloan's a whistle blower.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.048
The company breaks in his house,

21:24.050 --> 21:25.716
             they steal whatever
               he's got on them.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.585
 - I do want to tap the brakes
       just for a second

21:27.587 --> 21:31.589
 because, I mean, are we saying
     that a self-help group

21:31.591 --> 21:32.990
                   robbed a guy,
             slaughters a family

21:32.992 --> 21:34.625
              just to keep a lid
            on how they operate?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.528
- So we grab this guy
and find out.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.865
                     How's Lexi?

21:40.867 --> 21:43.634
- Uh, you know, threatening to
take a year off before college.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.336
She's calling it a "gap year."

21:45.338 --> 21:46.971
                   - "Gap year"?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.906
           Imagine trying to get
         that past your old man.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.841
- Imagine talking to my old man.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.845
Hey, Francis Kruger.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.618
       - [groans, grunts]

22:08.093 --> 22:10.528
 - If this is about that family,
               let me spare you,

22:10.530 --> 22:12.596
        I didn't do it.
   - What about the robbery?

22:12.598 --> 22:13.998
                 - What robbery?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.866
- Come on, Francis.
You know this.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.869
      You tell us what happened,
   everything goes good for you.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.505
- We got you on the neighbor's
security camera

22:21.507 --> 22:23.841
going into Allan Sloan's house

22:23.843 --> 22:26.444
20 minutes after
somebody murdered the Carlsons.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.881
Your unit messed around
with one of these

22:30.883 --> 22:32.950
back when you were
with the Sheriffs, right?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.952
But it work for you?
I mean, you get confessions

22:34.954 --> 22:36.821
with this thing?

22:36.823 --> 22:40.124
- How long before we place you
inside that Carlson house?

22:40.126 --> 22:42.493
         - I mean, Sloan's gonna
               blow the whistle.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.129
  Horizon calls you in to, what,

22:45.131 --> 22:47.398
clean up, right?

22:47.400 --> 22:50.801
I'll tell you
what we can't crack.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.704
How does the family figure in?

22:58.076 --> 23:01.779
Three kids are dead.
Not four.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.081
You left the little girl alive.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.717
And I'll tell you
something else...

23:06.719 --> 23:08.386
she ID'd you.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.589
 - Mm-hmm. From a photo array,
         in one second.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.125
                       - No way.
                   Not possible.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.995
- Spark it up.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.498
       - Hey, look, she's wrong.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.968
                 Track my phone.
  I was nowhere near that house.

23:23.970 --> 23:27.438
   They wanted Sloan's computer.
                       I got it.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.839
- You telling me
you had no dealings

23:28.841 --> 23:30.007
with the Carlson family?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.976
       - Not technically.
      - "Not technically."

23:31.978 --> 23:34.412
            Francis.
     [electricity popping]

23:34.414 --> 23:35.880
                   - Okay, okay.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.416
   Look, I did background on him

23:38.418 --> 23:40.951
      before Horizons loaned him
                     some money.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.054
        I found out Jeni Carlson
                  was a fighter.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.690
          She was in arbitration
        for some loan gone sour.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.859
      She wanted the money back.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.094
  - Not in any court records.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.929
 - No, it was private mediation.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.498
     Them against some kid.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.133
- Name.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.902
      - It's...it's in my files.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.703
- Name?

23:59.705 --> 24:01.505
                    - Dougherty.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.541
- Dougherty?

24:04.843 --> 24:06.444
Thank you.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.878
How much did they loan him?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.714
             - 800.
           - 800,000?

24:10.716 --> 24:13.484
            - What?
           No, $800.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.621
          - This guy?
      - Gerald Dougherty.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.824
     We ran his FOID card.
   It came back with nothing.

24:19.826 --> 24:23.227
  But his father is registered
   to a .40 caliber handgun,

24:23.229 --> 24:25.129
        so, I guess that
      could be the weapon.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.664
  - Just so I got this right,
       are we saying that

24:26.666 --> 24:28.833
this kid killed 5 people
for $800?

24:28.835 --> 24:31.235
 - We find that gun, we'll know.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.771
       Kicked out of high school
         for attacking a teacher

24:33.773 --> 24:35.039
               in a parking lot?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.607
          Why didn't I know this
                         before?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.976
- Couldn't make the connection
from a fight in a parking lot

24:38.978 --> 24:40.578
to a quintuple murder, Sarge.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.714
   - And I said, "Find out why."

24:44.883 --> 24:46.884
          I know it's just $800,
               but it might have

24:46.886 --> 24:48.919
    meant something to that kid.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.491
  I wanna look him in the eye
         and ask what.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.065
 - Hey, I gotta find this house.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.200
- You don't have to do it alone.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.503
      - You know I love a combo.

25:05.505 --> 25:09.507
- So what if the house on the
lake wasn't a vacation spot?

25:09.509 --> 25:11.275
I went through
Darren's financials.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.777
He managed a property
down on 47th St.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.112
             - That's Hyde Park.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.014
- Right on the lake.

25:20.619 --> 25:21.685
- That's it.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.754
That's the building
my dad worked on.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.590
I helped him redo the floors
on weekends.

25:26.592 --> 25:29.894
       - All right, well,
     let's go check it out.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.762
                - You know what?
          This is gonna be great

25:31.764 --> 25:33.831
      'cause Erin might actually
                   let me drive.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.066
   - That will never happen.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.968
            Come on.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.306
- Good luck.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.314
               - Can I help you?

25:50.316 --> 25:52.182
      - Where's your son,
         Mr. Dougherty?

25:52.184 --> 25:54.151
                 - I don't know.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.653
              Neighborhood Watch
                 was canvassing.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.787
   I think he was out with them.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.322
- He's not.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.924
      - We have a warrant
   to search your residence,

25:59.926 --> 26:02.993
 but first you need to show us
  where you store your weapon.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.034
           [beeping]

26:10.036 --> 26:11.769
- It's gone.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.072
      I don't understand.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.707
- Hey, yo.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.744
They found that
in Gerald's room.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.716
- This your weapon?

26:25.718 --> 26:28.786
                 - It is, but...
             I don't understand.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.588
           Are you saying my son
                       did this?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.222
- Jerome,
where would he have run to?

26:34.859 --> 26:37.895
          <i>[tense music]</i>

26:37.897 --> 26:45.970
               <i>â™ª </i>

26:55.313 --> 26:58.882
     - My mom made cookies
     while we were working.

26:58.884 --> 27:02.786
      My dad said not to,
      but she did anyway.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.922
      Peanut butter chip.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.726
                  - That's good.

27:08.728 --> 27:11.295
 Can you remember anything else?

27:13.365 --> 27:16.166
          - [exhales]

27:29.981 --> 27:33.017
          <i>[tense music]</i>

27:33.019 --> 27:36.820
               <i>â™ª </i>

27:36.822 --> 27:38.722
          He was here.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.059
 The man who killed my family.
          He was here.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.062
        [crying softly]

27:47.265 --> 27:50.300
            - Polly.
     - [crying intensifies]

27:50.302 --> 27:53.070
              - Hey, hey, Polly.

27:53.072 --> 27:56.106
Hey, it's okay.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.311
          - [sniffles]
          - It's okay.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.988
         - Listen, man,
      you gotta dig deep.

28:10.990 --> 28:14.058
The longer your son is missing,
     the worse this looks.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.026
- Gerald, run!

28:16.028 --> 28:17.161
                    - Watch him.

28:17.163 --> 28:23.967
         <i>[dramatic music]</i>

28:23.969 --> 28:29.239
               <i>â™ª </i>

28:29.241 --> 28:31.241
          - Go around!

28:31.243 --> 28:33.243
        [brakes screech]

28:38.249 --> 28:39.750
     - [shouts and grunts]

28:39.752 --> 28:41.985
           [groaning]

28:41.987 --> 28:43.120
       - Stay in the car.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.321
- Get up.
Get up.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.391
         Get over here.
           - [grunts]

28:47.393 --> 28:50.894
- What's the deal, Gerald?
You don't like us no more?

28:56.167 --> 28:58.469
           - You notice I didn't
               ask for a lawyer?

28:59.971 --> 29:02.439
It's 'cause I did nothing wrong.

29:04.309 --> 29:07.377
         - Just tell us
      about Katie Carlson.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.179
               - We went through
                  your computer.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.916
          There's you and Katie.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.819
                     She was 16.

29:15.821 --> 29:18.122
          And the rest of these,
                I can't look at.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.326
              So five members of
    the Carlson family are dead,

29:22.328 --> 29:26.263
      and you--you were sleeping
    with their teenage daughter.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.899
             What're we supposed
           to make of that, huh?

29:35.907 --> 29:39.843
     - Forget that this is
        statutory rape.

29:41.379 --> 29:44.848
     Just tell us what happened.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.850
    What, she break up with you?

29:46.852 --> 29:48.919
                    Dad find out
            what you were doing?

29:48.921 --> 29:50.220
                       'Cause...

29:51.456 --> 29:53.390
                     Look at me.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.895
             Any version of this
                      is motive.

29:57.897 --> 30:01.031
- [quietly]
No.

30:01.033 --> 30:04.034
No, no, no.
I would never hurt Katie.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.202
- Okay, what about her mom,
Jeni?

30:05.204 --> 30:07.337
      We know she was suing you.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.439
            So what--what was up
                 with that, man?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.508
- It's a long story,
but I needed some money,

30:11.510 --> 30:14.444
800 bucks, she loaned it to me.
They were good people.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.181
But I couldn't pay it back
and I couldn't tell my dad.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.817
So we were in court.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.491
I loved Katie.
I'm trying to help.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.161
               - Gerald, we have
                 your dad's gun.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.863
           We know it's gonna be
             a ballistics match,

30:32.865 --> 30:34.331
           so, hey, just tell us
                  what happened.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.601
- No, no, no, no,
I borrowed it to go on patrol.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.403
It hasn't been fired.
Test it.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.006
           - Then why'd you run?

30:45.577 --> 30:47.845
- My dad said "run."

30:51.282 --> 30:53.550
Someone wanted them dead,
but I'm telling you,

30:53.552 --> 30:55.586
it wasn't me.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.557
          - Put him in the cage.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.360
- Get up.
All right.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.430
   - So you can picture him?

31:06.432 --> 31:09.233
     You can see his face?

31:09.235 --> 31:11.168
                          - Yes.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.203
                    He was here.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.275
                    It was cold.

31:22.013 --> 31:25.616
             It--it was January.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.284
- Do you know his name?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.453
             - No, I don't know.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.589
                          But...

31:32.591 --> 31:34.958
            my dad went outside.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.264
                       [exhales]

31:40.266 --> 31:44.034
        They had a fight, and...

31:44.036 --> 31:46.603
            he--he wanted money.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.976
      Someone called the police.

31:54.946 --> 31:57.147
       - That's amazing.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.685
- I'm at the Hyde Park address.
I think I got a lead.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.987
               - Yeah, so do we.

32:03.989 --> 32:06.023
               Gerald Dougherty.
               He's in the cage.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.159
Let's, uh, corroborate
Polly's story.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.394
Can you pull an in-service call?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.095
There was an altercation
at this address.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.364
Patrol responded.
The timeline works.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.233
A fight would
explain Darren's injuries.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.268
         - One second.

32:25.576 --> 32:27.277
 Okay, yeah, yeah, here it is.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.514
        Uh, January 12,
in-service call for a domestic.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.115
Look, there was no report filed.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.684
                  Fight broke up
     before patrol could arrive,

32:33.686 --> 32:36.019
   so I'll play this for Voight.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.988
Send me a photo array.

32:44.195 --> 32:46.096
  - No, none of these are right.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.664
    The man who killed my family
                      was older.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.232
               He was, like, 50.

32:49.234 --> 32:50.367
        - Are you sure?

32:50.369 --> 32:52.502
                     - I'm sure.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.504
               Wait, I know him.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.506
               He lives near us.

32:56.508 --> 33:00.577
         Um, he likes my sister.
             His name is Gerald.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.512
- Okay, Polly,

33:02.514 --> 33:05.082
would you try closing your eyes

33:05.084 --> 33:06.717
and just trying
to picture the man

33:06.719 --> 33:09.052
who came here
and argued with your dad?

33:09.054 --> 33:12.222
We need you to be really,
really accurate.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.491
                 - He--he's big.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.261
               He...had a beard.
          He had a brown jacket.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.529
- We need you to be positive,

33:19.531 --> 33:21.398
because right now
there's other policemen

33:21.400 --> 33:23.300
who think it was someone else,
someone younger.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.702
          - No, I'm telling you.
             He had a red truck.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.571
                The kind you can
             zip the top off of.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.675
          - Good job.
         That's great.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.311
     - I got nothing useful
 from the report on January 12,

33:34.313 --> 33:35.679
          so I pulled
   up the original 911 call.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.347
            - Right.
       - Check this out.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.649
     <i>- Do you know either man</i>
  <i>involved in the fight, ma'am?</i>

33:39.651 --> 33:42.152
   <i>- It's the building manager,</i>
         <i>Darren Carlson.</i>

33:42.154 --> 33:44.121
       <i>He's on the ground.</i>
  <i>The other guy is kicking him.</i>

33:44.123 --> 33:46.023
      <i>- You don't recognize</i>
          <i>the other man?</i>

33:46.025 --> 33:48.058
       <i>- No, he just jumped</i>

Uh, Lewis Barrow.
50 years old on the dot.

 In Stateville for three years
         for burglary.

    Released without charges
      from that burglary.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.286
- Right before he
turned his life around.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.789

    get a photo to Lindsay,

           to go down like this.

          He was out in the car,

36:58.750 --> 37:00.784
              I was in the house
             when we get popped.

              I took the charge.

           I needed money, okay?

             He didn't get that.

and kill his whole family.
