You look incredible.
You're glowing.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.788
Oh, come on,
no one really glows.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.838
Okay, look, Duncan,

09:53.885 --> 09:56.376
when I asked for my stuff,
I didn't mean hand delivery.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.971
But I had to come and see
you for an explanation.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.263
You can't tell me
that two people
who spend a week

10:03.394 --> 10:05.555
making love in the spray
at Victoria Falls...

10:05.688 --> 10:08.680
Duncan, no,
you're right.
Oh, it was great,

10:09.484 --> 10:11.270
but how well do we really
know each other?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.814
You know, our hopes,
our dreams,

10:13.947 --> 10:17.565
our reactions
to surprises?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.317
Well, running off
to the other side
of the world

10:20.453 --> 10:22.034
isn't exactly
a way to find out,
now, is it?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.903
No, I know. Ijust...

10:27.836 --> 10:30.043
Maybe our timing
was just off.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.918
There's another guy?

10:35.844 --> 10:37.880
(SIGHS) Something
like that, yeah.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.306
Well, I appreciate
your honesty,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.345
(MOUTHING)

10:45.478 --> 10:46.979
and I'll respect
your wishes.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.311
(MOUTHING)

10:54.154 --> 10:55.894
After I meet him.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.366
I'm not going
to a seance.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.113
Okay. Well, then think
of it as a scientific
investigation.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.704
Sorry, my crystal ball's
in the shop.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.122
All right.
Um, I'll go.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.746
But see what you
can find out about
Murray Drechmeyer.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.499
Like is he crazy
or really crazy?

11:17.635 --> 11:18.841
Like, what does
he have to gain

11:18.970 --> 11:21.552
by proving that
Eureka's haunted?

11:21.681 --> 11:22.841
(SIGHING) Right.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.093
Spirits, we know
you're out there.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.642
We're all friends.
We all believe.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.896
Join us.
Join the circle.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.441
Show us that you're here.

(DOOR OPENING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

11:47.999 --> 11:49.034
(SOFTLY) Sorry.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.455
So, that's a giant
TIRD grabber?

11:58.176 --> 12:00.292
What?
Ghost whisperer.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.926
Sometimes, thermal energy
is the final indicator.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.472
Visitations are often
preceded by other signs.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.940
(SOFTLY) They could be
all around us.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

12:25.870 --> 12:27.952

12:28.623 --> 12:31.831
Madame Drechmeyer. Hmm.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.744
Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer,
the premiere medium
of her day,

12:35.880 --> 12:39.714
has contacted more
than a thousand spirits
on the other side.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.002
(LAUGHS)

12:41.135 --> 12:42.261
Yeah.

(CUP SHATTERING)

12:52.480 --> 12:53.686

12:54.607 --> 12:58.816

cross over from
the other side.

Sorry, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, my bad.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.158
Sorry. Hey, Jo.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.833
JO: (ON PHONE) Carter.
Get over here, now!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.960
Jo?
Carter, look out!

13:24.095 --> 13:25.335
They came!

13:25.471 --> 13:28.008
Whoa! In the cell!
They heard me!

13:30.852 --> 13:31.807
(GASPS)

13:32.895 --> 13:37.104
Come on, come on.
The desk! Desk, desk!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.694
I told you
they were here.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.746
Yeah.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.830
So, if you invited
them to Cafe Diem,
how'd they end up here?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.874
I don't know.
But you gotta admit,

14:01.007 --> 14:02.668
They showed up
when I called them.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.006
Yeah, at the
wrong location.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.376
In a totally
different building.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.673
All right, so they zigged
when they should have zagged.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.342
Look, think what
you want, Sheriff,

14:10.475 --> 14:12.887
but I proved myself tonight
just like I said I would.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.476
The Drech-man is
back in business.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.433
The Drech-man?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.807
There's gotta be
a reasonable
explanation for this.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.606
Heat waves, uh,
St. Elmo's Fire.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.071
What if Drechmeyer
has a reasonable
explanation?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.155
Come on!

14:28.284 --> 14:31.526
Murray's mother,
Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer,

14:31.662 --> 14:33.994
has made a real name
for herself communicating
with the dead.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.160
(SIGHS) Yeah, what if...
What if it's genetic?

14:37.585 --> 14:40.702
All right, let's back-burner
the whole Addams Family thing
for a second.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.794
What's that effect you
were talking about, the...
Casimir effect.

14:42.924 --> 14:43.959
Yeah. What if that
had something to do
with it?

14:44.092 --> 14:45.707
Well, not without
help, I mean,

14:45.843 --> 14:48.334
the magnitude of apparently
what you guys saw here

14:48.471 --> 14:52.931
would require some sort of
localized focusing device.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.767
Like this one?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.605
Or maybe these.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.395
We've been finding them
all over town.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.610
They're energy
displacement sensors.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.727
They're part of
my research.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.820
They record disturbances
in the barrier.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.861
Are you sure they
didn't cause them?
Absolutely.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.245
Murray, you can't
just install quantum
vibration sensors

15:13.371 --> 15:15.407
outside of G.D.
without permission.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.950
Well, you wouldn't
have given it to me,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.448
and this was
too important.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.372
Oh, which part, the science
or proving your mother
wasn't a fraud?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.583
What did you tell him?

15:24.715 --> 15:26.706
Admit it, Murray,
you're obsessed.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.129
Do you know what it's like
when the other woman
in your relationship

15:29.262 --> 15:31.173
is your husband's
dead mother?

15:31.305 --> 15:33.466
Okay, this has to stop.
I'm suspending you
indefinitely.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.011
(SIGHS) But...
Wait.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.554
These sensors
came from our lab.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.520
I designed them.
They're just receivers.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.934
They couldn't have caused
any of these disturbances.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.853
(SIGHS) Thank you, M.B.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.061
Hope now you'll start
to believe me.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.903
I've seen more activity
in the last three days

15:50.032 --> 15:51.772
than I have in the
last three decades.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.820
Look, something's out
there, Sheriff Carter.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.285
(SIGHS) If we don't
help it cross over,

15:56.414 --> 15:58.370
who knows
what it'll do.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.917
His mother was
a drama queen, too.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.462
I think Murray
may be on to something.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.631
(LAUGHS) Oh, great.
So, now you believe
in ghosts?

16:12.763 --> 16:16.301
Allison, the disturbances
didn't start until
three days ago.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.597
Did something special
happen here three days ago?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.394
Hmm?

16:23.191 --> 16:25.227
We reopened Section Five.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.061
Section Five?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.065
I hate that section!

16:30.239 --> 16:33.072
Well, it can't be
a coincidence that
Drechmeyer's vibe-finder

16:33.201 --> 16:35.066
pinged off the charts
on the same day

16:35.203 --> 16:37.819
that you took the lid
off Pandora's box.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.288
Allison,
you gotta do something
before this gets worse.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.954
Okay. Get in.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.333
Now, you know that
I can't talk to you

16:48.466 --> 16:49.751
about things that
happen down there.

16:49.884 --> 16:50.964
CARTER: Yeah.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.176
But I can tell you
that there is a new project.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.175
Well, can you tell me
what it is?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.798
Actually, I'm gonna
do better than that.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.551
I'm gonna take you
to the most
knowledgeable source.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.939
The new head
of Section Five.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.896
You remember Tess.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.484
You're the...
You're the new head
of Section Five?

17:13.616 --> 17:16.733
I got bored after
I finished planning
the baby shower.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.860
Carter needs some help
with an investigation.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.702
There have been some
disturbing events
around town

17:20.831 --> 17:23.868
that seem to coincide
with some of the labs
coming back online down here.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.707
Yeah, and disturbing
kind of sums it up.

17:25.836 --> 17:30.125
Just cooperate within
the parameters of security.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.627
Play nice.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.297
9%,;

17:43.020 --> 17:44.305
Everything would
have been fine

17:44.438 --> 17:46.770
if he just hadn't
shown up.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.311
It wouldn't have been
fine, because you're
still lying to him.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.149
Why haven't you told him
you're pregnant?

17:51.279 --> 17:52.519
Because Duncan is a nomad,

17:52.655 --> 17:56.113
and I'm liking the idea
of settling down here
with you guys.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.153
I can't do that to him.
Gee, thanks.

17:58.286 --> 18:01.244
(LAUGHS) No, I mean
I can't tie him down.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.952
Well, maybe you should
let him decide that.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.836
Good morning.
Hi.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.380
Weren't you wearing
that yesterday?

18:10.506 --> 18:12.246
Oh, yeah, look at that.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.466
Oh, right. You stayed
at his place last night.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.676
Right, so, uh...
So where is he?

18:17.805 --> 18:22.925
Hmm? Um, that's a really
good question, Duncan,

18:23.060 --> 18:25.551
one that deserves
an honest answer.

18:26.731 --> 18:32.192
(SIGHING) The truth is,
he's, uh, right here.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.151
Doug, sweetie, hi!

18:34.280 --> 18:36.111
Come say "hi."
Hi.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.322
Hi. Yeah. Um...

18:38.451 --> 18:40.817
Duncan, this is Doug.
My boyfriend.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.409
Uh, your what, now?
Yeah.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.403
Just... He hates labels.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.405
Nice to meet you, Doug.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.041
So, how long have
you two been together?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.286
Um, sometimes it feels
like forever, huh?

18:51.422 --> 18:53.834
(CHUCKLES) And other
times it feels like
it's brand new.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.581
Right! Anyway,
now that you
guys have met...

18:55.718 --> 18:58.175
Well, no, hold on! No.
Doug, what do you do
for work?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.340
Oh, um, artificial
intelligence, primarily.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.429
Although I dabble in biotech.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.675
Really? Because I've been
trying to integrate
biotechnological treatment

19:05.811 --> 19:08.678
into my epidemiological work
in Third World countries.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.271
Oh, yeah? Well,
there are some really
promising applications

19:11.400 --> 19:14.858
in viral infections,
skin regeneration,
you name it.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.736
Join us for breakfast.
Would you, please?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.105
I would love to
pick your brain

19:19.241 --> 19:21.323
and get to know the man
who stole Lexi's heart.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.535
Oh, what a tangled
web we weave.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.702
DUNCAN: There was a gentleman
I had with an abscess.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.165
Well, what I've always
found useful...

19:30.920 --> 19:32.831
It's been a pretty
uneventful tour so far.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.039
Oh, you've been here
for three hours.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.291
Do you have any labs
that are actually open?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.634
(ROBOT WHIRRING)
There's a working lab
right behind me.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.674

Don't bother.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.423
Johnson said he'll be
traveling for a few days.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.687
Oh, great,
then he won't mind
if we look around.

happens in here?

20:02.660 --> 20:05.322
(STAMMERING) Oh!
Like rockets
and whatnot.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.571
Yeah. That would be
the systems
we already have.

You hear that?

20:19.510 --> 20:20.841
Do you hear...

20:21.762 --> 20:23.047
That tickles my teeth.
Hear that?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.386
Yeah. Uh, the

20:24.515 --> 20:26.471
Back on the bus.
Let's go.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.930
Oh!

20:33.983 --> 20:35.723
Do you feel hot?
No.

Sure. Yeah.

So, you sure you
didn't feel hot.

Hey! Just so you know,
they've reopened
Section Five,

related to the disturbances
we've been having.

Hey, Fargo.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.231

Everything is fine.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.979
The disturbances
don't have anything
to do with the signal.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.231
ALLISON: Oh, good.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.232
But the signal
is getting stronger.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.155
Interesting.
Okay, how long...

21:29.288 --> 21:30.528
Signal?

21:31.874 --> 21:33.159
What signal?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.493
Fargo, you know anything
about a signal?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.667
Dr. Rogers,
it's Go Green month.
We need to talk.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.835
Fargo! I was
talking to you!

21:41.967 --> 21:43.673
It's about your lab's
excess energy consumption.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.543

a high level of spirit
activity in here.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.631
Dr. Drechmeyer.

21:50.851 --> 21:54.014
Hey. That's
a strong one.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.386
It's me.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.235
What spirit activity?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.188
Hello?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.561
Hi.

22:03.697 --> 22:04.777
Hey.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.272
Ma'am? Hi.

22:07.993 --> 22:08.778
Can anyone see me?

22:08.911 --> 22:09.991
TESS: I do.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.279
Tess.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.155
No one sees me either.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.414
Whoa!

22:21.298 --> 22:22.879
Do that again!

22:25.135 --> 22:27.342
Are we dead?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.848
Was there a feeling?
Any sensation?

22:36.981 --> 22:38.471
No, I don't know.
It happened real fast.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.017
Okay. I gotta try this.

with anything in here.

what this means?

22:51.495 --> 22:53.281
No! I don't!

The universe is revealing
one of its secrets to us.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.364
Do you know how
rare that is?

right up there
with relativity,

22:59.962 --> 23:01.668

Oh, just come here.

You satisfied?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.137
In what way?

23:19.273 --> 23:22.310
If we can feel each other,
how can we be dead?

23:22.443 --> 23:25.935
And why aren't there any
other dead people around
here besides us, huh?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.982
How do you know
there aren't?

what you're doing here
in Section Five.

Not my information
to share.

the current pickle
we're in.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.855

are my field,

24:52.992 --> 24:54.778
and they usually
lead straight to
some G.D. project.

See? Just by using
the word "pickles,"

24:56.912 --> 24:58.197
you momentarily
relieved my tension,

on solving our problem.

before we went in
there, right?

talking to us. Remember?

25:07.131 --> 25:09.372
Yes.
So whatever happened...

done that to him?

Only if he didn't have it
calibrated properly.

Yeah. H.J.'s baby.
Interdimensional travel.

how to cross over
using his p-branes.

membrane barriers

are called p-branes.

What? Science can't have
a sense of humor?

27:04.832 --> 27:07.323
Yeah. Fair enough.
It's all based on
string theory.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.792
Certain levels of
subatomic vibration
can unweave the p-brane,

27:10.921 --> 27:12.752
allowing for
interdimensional travel.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.338
Okay, so
the platform things?

27:15.467 --> 27:18.004
Well, looks like
H.J. figured out
how to cross over,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.674
but knew that he couldn't
physically interact
between dimensions

27:20.806 --> 27:26.176
once he got here,
so he built a portable
version as a way to get back.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.687
That clearly didn't work.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.428
Well, the p-brane's
kind of like a curtain.

If you don't pierce
through it,

27:30.816 --> 27:32.556
you're just gonna
make it wiggle.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.934

on the other side.

a theory as any.

how this thing works?

it's kinda like

27:54.423 --> 27:55.879
I'm really good at that.

27:56.008 --> 28:00.217
And if you're right,
as soon as I turn
this thing on,

28:00.345 --> 28:01.630
Dr. Spooky's machine

28:01.763 --> 28:04.049
should be able to
pick up the vibrations
from the p-brane,

28:04.183 --> 28:05.969
and we might be able
to communicate.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.717
So, for the last three
days, Murray's been
communicating with H.J.?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.560
Yeah, whenever H.J.
tried to get back over,

28:10.689 --> 28:13.601
it shook the p-brane
hard enough to set
this guy's dials off.

28:13.734 --> 28:14.849
(SIGHS) Okay.

28:15.944 --> 28:16.933

Wait! What if you
end up like H.J.?

28:18.655 --> 28:20.771

you feel better.

I made contact.

And I realize that the 2,000
wasn't nearly as powerful

29:47.828 --> 29:49.568

adjustments.

Yeah. Enough to
cross her over.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.271
I made it in
no problem.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.690
Re-entry's proving
to be more difficult.

31:47.823 --> 31:48.687
Atomic fire.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.987
(STUTTERS) Oh, like when
the space shuttle loses
a couple of heat tiles.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.199
Yes. Something like that.

31:53.328 --> 31:57.037
We need to get back down
to Section Five so I can
recalibrate this thing.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.874
CARTER: There's
no physical interaction.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.703
So, we're stuck
until someone
presses the button.

32:07.551 --> 32:08.791

You're not in
love with him?

32:08.927 --> 32:09.916
LEXI: Are you kidding me?

32:10.053 --> 32:12.920
When I first met him,
I knew in 10 seconds
that I loved him.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.341
So, what's the problem?

32:14.474 --> 32:16.851
(SIGHING) What if
he doesn't love me?

32:16.977 --> 32:17.966
The guy came all
the way from Africa

32:18.103 --> 32:19.309
(SIGHING)
to bring you
a box of yourjunk.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.679
I mean,
if that's not love,
I don't know what is.

32:21.815 --> 32:22.975
Okay, so what
if he loves me,

32:23.108 --> 32:26.100
but what if he doesn't love
pregnant me, you know?

32:26.236 --> 32:28.693
This guy,
he builds clinics,
he saves villages.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.107
He knows Bono.
I just...

32:30.240 --> 32:32.731
I don't want him
to feel trapped,
you know?

32:32.868 --> 32:34.153
There's only one way
you're gonna find out.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.823

Things are getting
worse around town.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.173
I thought Murray's
journals could help.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.164
All these calculations
are his?

32:49.301 --> 32:52.714
Yes. He never let me
look at them.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.382
Actually, I've never
really paid attention.

32:54.514 --> 32:55.754
When your husband
goes off the deep end...

32:55.891 --> 32:57.176
You try not to
fall in with him.

32:57.309 --> 33:01.177
Hmm. Before he became
obsessed with his spirits,

33:01.313 --> 33:04.225
we were conducting research
on vibratory p-brane
manipulation.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.893

Yeah.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.733
What if his crazy
ghost-hunting was...

33:08.862 --> 33:10.944
An actual scientific
breakthrough?

33:11.072 --> 33:13.404
Uh, p-branes, shaking
between dimensions,

33:13.533 --> 33:15.319

with p-branes.

(BEEPING)

33:25.795 --> 33:28.172
H.J., your oscillations
seem steep.

33:28.298 --> 33:31.290
If I wanted your opinion,
I would have asked for it.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.927
Why do you have
such a problem with me?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.886
The whole scientific community
has a problem with you.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.721
Oh, why? Because
I disproved Cook and Moore's
half-baked theory

33:38.850 --> 33:40.715
about fractals not needing
a Hausdorff dimension

33:40.852 --> 33:42.262
greater than their
topological one?

33:42.395 --> 33:44.010
Or because I told
a department head
at Heidelberg

33:44.147 --> 33:45.683
that he totally needed
a better toupee?

33:45.815 --> 33:47.351
I'm working here!

33:59.538 --> 34:01.369
You really said that?

34:01.498 --> 34:02.954
Duh. You can't screw
around with Hausdorff...

34:03.083 --> 34:04.698
No. About the toupee.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.873
Oh. Well, it looked like
he was walking around
with a ferret on his head.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.667
As long as you're
trying to help, right?

34:11.800 --> 34:14.382
And, look, if he doesn't
go easy on that p-brane
the next time through,

34:14.511 --> 34:17.469
we're all gonna
light up like
the Jumbotron at Fenway.

I learned statistics?

34:22.978 --> 34:24.593
Well, only math
regular people need.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.015
I believe she just
insulted you, Sheriff.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.888
Oh, that's okay.

34:31.278 --> 34:32.643
Listen...

34:33.321 --> 34:35.232
H.J., are you sure about
these oscillations?

34:35.365 --> 34:36.605
This could be what...
I'm sure!

34:36.741 --> 34:38.606
As long as my equipment's
running on the other side,

34:38.743 --> 34:40.654
I'll be in vibratory sync
with the p-brane.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.072
Once I've calibrated
it correctly,

34:42.205 --> 34:44.696
I shall pass right through
the dimensional curtain

34:44.833 --> 34:46.789
and collect my Nobel Prize.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.294
ALLISON: This is
Johnson's lab.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.536
According to Fargo,
he's traveling
for a few days.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.037
Deacon, what the hell
is he doing here?

34:52.173 --> 34:54.710
Traveling? Then why
are his instruments
reading out?

34:54.843 --> 34:56.049
Is that what
I think it is?

34:56.177 --> 34:58.008
It's an electromagnetic
force field generator.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.469
On steroids.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.431
Ifthis has been running
the whole time
that H.J. has been gone,

35:02.559 --> 35:05.426
it could be what's been
causing the disruption
in the p-brane all along.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.678
Murray's technology wasn't
causing anything bad.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.476
It was reading the vibration
from H.J.'s technology.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.600
I think we found
Carter's ghost.

35:12.736 --> 35:15.443
You are awesome!
We have to
shut it down.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.688

electromagnet is
our only way out!

We have to go now!

35:19.993 --> 35:22.359
No, H.J., you can't.
You haven't finished
calibrating!

35:22.495 --> 35:24.656
Don't tell me how to
work my own device!

35:24.789 --> 35:27.747
It's ready. Besides,
he shuts down
my equipment,

35:27.876 --> 35:29.332
and we won't get
another chance.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.828
How long will it take?
It'll take a while.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.625
Not like there's
an on/off switch,
thank God.

35:34.758 --> 35:35.838
Mary-Beth and I
have to figure out

35:35.967 --> 35:38.754
the exact vibratory

On it.

35:38.887 --> 35:39.876

help you do that.

ask what's gonna
happen to us

if they turn off

you get us back?

have to answer?

but the way his body
skid across the floor,

an apology.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.269
I guess you didn't
park your car in the

36:31.398 --> 36:32.763
Huh?
The skid marks.

36:32.899 --> 36:33.684
I mean, I should have
known when I saw them.

36:33.817 --> 36:36.559
There's no way you skidded
your car sideways.
Sideways.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.936
But the p-branes
do move sideways.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.781
What?
H.J.'s oscillations
were too steep.

36:43.910 --> 36:44.740
I...
What does that mean?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.734
It means that
H.J.'s aim was way off,

36:46.871 --> 36:48.657
and you need to
make sure they don't
turn that machine off,

36:48.790 --> 36:50.280

what to do now.

recalibrate this thing.

(STAMMERING) Yeah,

37:27.078 --> 37:30.241
Well, because if Allison
knows we're in here,

37:30.373 --> 37:31.658
then she won't turn off
the platform.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.077

see or hear you, so...

we felt the heat

felt his mother.
It's all energy, right?

37:39.966 --> 37:42.378

On how you shake

40:58.957 --> 41:01.494
Ready to tell me
what's really
going on now?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.787
Douglas isn't really
my boyfriend.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.626
I just told you that
because I couldn't
tell you the truth,

41:05.755 --> 41:08.667
which was that
I missed you
every single day.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.377
That's a relief,

41:10.927 --> 41:12.713
because I think
he's gay.

41:13.888 --> 41:14.877
(MOUTHING)

41:15.640 --> 41:17.881
There's something else.
I probably should have
told you a long time ago,

41:18.017 --> 41:19.882
but I was too afraid
that you'd freak out,

41:20.019 --> 41:22.806
and the truth
is that I'm the one
who's been freaking out.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.681
I figured you'd come
around if I was just
patient enough.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.023
Okay.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.815
So you're...
Yeah.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.613
Twins.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.827
So, what do you think?

41:42.792 --> 41:45.499
I think I'm gonna have
to think about this.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.345
Busy?

42:05.982 --> 42:07.973
Oh. No. Just, uh,

42:08.943 --> 42:10.808
clearing Drechmeyer
and Mary-Beth

42:10.945 --> 42:13.982
to take over
Johnson's lab
in Section Five.

42:14.115 --> 42:15.730
They're working
together now.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.870
Long day, huh?

42:20.538 --> 42:23.280
Yeah. But at least
I spent it in
one dimension.

42:23.416 --> 42:24.496
(CHUCKLING)

42:24.625 --> 42:25.660
You okay?

42:25.793 --> 42:26.828
Yeah, I mean,
I thought
I was dead,

42:26.961 --> 42:29.077
and I couldn't
communicate
with anyone.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.623
Except you.

42:33.634 --> 42:34.965
Carter, is there
something wrong?

42:35.094 --> 42:37.961
You and Henry are
working on something...

42:38.765 --> 42:39.880
A signal?

42:40.892 --> 42:43.759
And then you invite
your friend from SETI,

42:44.687 --> 42:48.305
the place where
they communicate
with out there.

42:48.858 --> 42:53.522
And you put her in charge
of a secret project
in Section Five.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.986
Carter, you know
that I can't talk
to you about this.

42:56.115 --> 42:58.492
Well, Drechmeyer was
right about one thing.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.324
Something's coming.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.154
That's the signal,
isn't it?

43:08.086 --> 43:09.792
Carter, I can't.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.583
Well, you know
where to find me.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.095
(SIGHS)
