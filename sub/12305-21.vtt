WEBVTT

00:40.084 --> 00:41.669
Thanks Frank.

00:41.711 --> 00:42.879
So, what's the story?

00:42.920 --> 00:45.214
We've got a jumper, name's Manuel Ortega

00:45.256 --> 00:47.467
almost we can speak bump too.

00:49.093 --> 00:52.555
He jumps through a window to commit
suicide, that doesn't make sense.

00:52.597 --> 00:56.017
They usualy take the path of least
resistence, don't they gentlemen.

00:56.225 --> 00:59.979
These guys don't want to create more
pain for themself, they want a release.

01:00.021 --> 01:03.733
Plenty of briges in Miami to jump of
without bunches of glass gettin' in the way.

01:03.775 --> 01:07.528
I agree with that too, so we
may be be dealing with a homicide

01:07.570 --> 01:10.198
That was my job to classify that.

01:10.239 --> 01:12.742
Shanon Hegans, the new M.E.

01:12.784 --> 01:14.535
Plaisir to be working
with you gentlemen.

01:14.577 --> 01:17.038
Dr. Hegans, glad to have you on board

01:17.121 --> 01:20.625
I realise I have some big shoes to
fill, so hope you'll bear with me.

01:21.584 --> 01:23.211
Let see.

01:23.678 --> 01:27.890
The victim suffer any more
lacerations to the hands,

01:28.182 --> 01:30.601
face and neck.

01:32.103 --> 01:33.104
What the hell was that?

01:33.145 --> 01:35.731
Call fire rescue... We may
have a live one here!

01:40.236 --> 01:40.987
She's hit!

01:41.362 --> 01:43.614
She's hit! Shanon!

01:43.823 --> 01:44.991
Shanon!

01:49.203 --> 01:50.955
Go! Go! Go!

02:35.875 --> 02:36.667
She's...

02:36.792 --> 02:38.502
gone.

03:53.554 --> 03:54.805
Excuse me.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.390
Dr. Thomas Wellner.

03:56.432 --> 03:58.267
I was told to report here,

03:58.767 --> 04:01.020
uh, fill in for Dr. Wood's replacement?

04:01.145 --> 04:02.187
Yeah.

04:02.229 --> 04:05.190
Actually, you're
replacing the replacement.

04:05.441 --> 04:08.235
Dr. Higgins was killed in the crossfire.

04:09.862 --> 04:11.530
I see.

04:18.161 --> 04:19.204
Hey, Frank.

04:19.663 --> 04:21.165
One hell of a morning, huh?

04:21.206 --> 04:22.583
No luck on tracking the shooter.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.668
I got every man out
there canvassing the area.

04:24.710 --> 04:26.128
Oh. We've got every angle covered here.

04:26.170 --> 04:27.338
I'm gonna take the streets.

04:27.379 --> 04:29.381
Got Ryan and Natalia
going to check out the room

04:29.423 --> 04:30.716
that Manny Ortega fell from.

04:30.758 --> 04:33.510
Think that was a bad call
on Fire-Rescue's part?

04:33.636 --> 04:34.929
I mean, you heard it.

04:35.054 --> 04:36.972
Our dead guy took a damn breath.

04:37.014 --> 04:38.557
Well, wasn't a breath.

04:38.599 --> 04:40.059
It was a death rattle.

04:51.195 --> 04:53.656
Sounds like our shooter
was lying in wait.

04:53.697 --> 04:55.908
Wanted to make sure Ortega was dead.

04:55.950 --> 04:58.452
He didn't care about who was
collateral damage, either.

04:58.494 --> 05:01.538
Our new M.E. was in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

05:02.790 --> 05:04.667
I want this guy bad.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.670
Yeah, we'll get him, Frank.

05:08.045 --> 05:09.380
We'll get him.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.185
Excuse me?

05:24.395 --> 05:25.813
Am I in the right place?

05:25.896 --> 05:27.356
Well, it depends.

05:27.648 --> 05:29.567
- Who are you?
- Juan Ortega.

05:29.608 --> 05:31.735
The medical examiner
said I could come up here,

05:31.777 --> 05:33.028
see about my brother, Manny.

05:33.112 --> 05:34.905
Yeah. Listen, Mr. Ortega,
we have other means

05:34.989 --> 05:36.740
of identification if
you don't want to...

05:39.451 --> 05:41.078
After everything that's happened,

05:41.120 --> 05:43.163
I don't want to remember him like that.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.587
Listen, can I... can
I take his belongings?

05:49.920 --> 05:51.589
I'm afraid we can't release them.

05:51.630 --> 05:53.549
This is still an open case.

05:55.426 --> 05:57.428
All right, I understand.

06:00.598 --> 06:04.685
If you don't mind me asking,
were you two very close?

06:05.185 --> 06:07.688
Well, when we were younger, you know...

06:10.858 --> 06:12.860
Yeah. Manny was prideful, you know.

06:12.902 --> 06:13.986
It got in the way.

06:14.403 --> 06:15.654
How so?

06:15.779 --> 06:17.656
We didn't have much schooling, you know?

06:17.698 --> 06:19.533
I did well for myself, and he struggled.

06:22.369 --> 06:24.914
You think you'd know of anybody
that'd want to do harm to him?

06:24.955 --> 06:27.082
Not specifically, but...

06:27.833 --> 06:30.461
He'd disappear for weeks at a time.

06:30.502 --> 06:32.504
Not to do any missionary work.

06:34.048 --> 06:37.676
I'd like to say that I never
thought he'd end up this way, but...

06:38.844 --> 06:40.095
I can't.

06:58.697 --> 07:01.158
It's like a war zone down there.

07:02.201 --> 07:04.995
Just goes to show, no crime
scene is ever safe, huh?

07:05.037 --> 07:06.914
God, that poor M.E.

07:07.331 --> 07:10.376
So obviously Manny
Ortega fell from up here.

07:10.501 --> 07:13.045
Yeah, or he was pushed.

07:13.212 --> 07:16.006
Well, the building's vacant, so what
was he doing up here in the first place?

07:16.257 --> 07:18.133
My guess is, nothing good.

07:18.842 --> 07:21.262
This room is completely empty.

07:22.263 --> 07:25.224
It's going to be really hard to
get an I.D. on the killer, I think.

07:26.892 --> 07:28.102
Maybe not.

07:28.227 --> 07:29.520
You have something?

07:29.561 --> 07:30.604
Blood swipe.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.565
Blood swipe?

07:33.232 --> 07:34.483
Good catch.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.923
So who are you?

07:59.133 --> 08:00.634
You know my name.

08:00.759 --> 08:02.094
Evan Caldwell.

08:03.262 --> 08:05.180
Let me rephrase that.

08:05.723 --> 08:07.391
Who are you really?

08:09.602 --> 08:11.103
Reaching in my back pocket.

08:11.145 --> 08:12.479
Be my guest.

08:15.065 --> 08:16.400
I'm ATF.

08:17.151 --> 08:20.154
So you're a federal agent
with a criminal record.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.405
Pure fiction.

08:21.447 --> 08:22.907
Used to work undercover.

08:23.073 --> 08:25.284
Those trumped-up charges
gave me street cred.

08:25.326 --> 08:26.702
In case somebody got wise.

08:26.744 --> 08:28.162
Manny Ortega.

08:30.414 --> 08:31.790
Yeah.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.793
Manny's death was, uh...

08:35.461 --> 08:36.669
an inconvenience.

08:36.712 --> 08:37.837
Inconvenience?

08:37.880 --> 08:40.883
You mean, like my medical examiner.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.760
You got her killed today, you know?

08:42.842 --> 08:44.303
I could charge you with murder.

08:44.345 --> 08:46.722
Now hang on a minute.

08:47.389 --> 08:50.476
I've been tracking illegal
munitions sales in south Florida.

08:50.517 --> 08:51.602
Manny showed up on my radar.

08:51.644 --> 08:53.604
- I'm losing interest, Agent.
- All right.

08:53.771 --> 08:55.064
He was small time,

08:55.105 --> 08:56.482
but in a big game.

08:56.815 --> 08:58.692
He was running all around Miami

08:58.734 --> 09:00.986
scarg up buyers for illegal rounds.

09:01.028 --> 09:03.614
And you wanted to find out
who Manny was working for.

09:03.656 --> 09:05.032
I squeezed him a little.

09:05.157 --> 09:06.617
See if I could get him to squeal.

09:06.951 --> 09:08.160
He wouldn't bite.

09:08.869 --> 09:10.621
You got the wrong guy, man...

09:10.663 --> 09:11.622
Cut the crap.

09:11.664 --> 09:13.415
Man, I've been on you for weeks.

09:13.457 --> 09:15.334
All these inquires you've been making...

09:15.376 --> 09:17.670
Hanging out with drug
dealers, rival gangs...

09:17.878 --> 09:18.963
What?

09:19.088 --> 09:20.714
I can't have friends?

09:21.715 --> 09:22.758
That's cute.

09:22.925 --> 09:23.926
Cute.

09:24.176 --> 09:25.886
Look, I know you're
working for somebody.

09:25.928 --> 09:27.346
You tell me who, and I don't make

09:27.388 --> 09:29.431
your very near future a living hell.

09:29.473 --> 09:31.267
I ain't saying squat.

09:31.725 --> 09:33.644
I can take the heat.

09:35.771 --> 09:37.273
We'll see about that.

09:45.239 --> 09:47.658
I could have gotten
Ortega if I had the time,

09:47.700 --> 09:49.618
but somebody beat me to it.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.120
And with him went my case.

09:51.161 --> 09:54.540
Am I supposed to be satisfied by this?

09:56.041 --> 09:57.751
I guess you'll have to be.

09:57.835 --> 10:00.045
Not for long, Agent.

10:00.754 --> 10:02.006
Beat it.

10:03.716 --> 10:05.259
Toodle-loo.

10:20.649 --> 10:22.568
Dr. Wellner, I really
need something to run with.

10:22.610 --> 10:24.069
Do you have anything from these bodies?

10:24.194 --> 10:26.238
Just barely getting started on this guy.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.282
I guess I got used to the old M.E.

10:28.449 --> 10:30.117
Right
- Alexx.

10:30.159 --> 10:32.578
I don't know what kind of spell
this guy had over you guys, but...

10:32.620 --> 10:33.412
A woman.

10:33.746 --> 10:34.997
What?

10:35.039 --> 10:36.874
Alexx is a woman.

10:37.374 --> 10:38.375
Whatever.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.711
Look, this is detailed work.

10:40.961 --> 10:43.589
A tad more delicate
than dusting for prints.

10:47.343 --> 10:49.929
Listen, as an M.E., I'm sure
you can appreciate the gravity

10:49.970 --> 10:51.263
of this case, okay?

10:52.097 --> 10:53.933
All we have to work with
right now is trajectory.

10:53.974 --> 10:55.267
So if you please...

10:55.851 --> 10:57.186
put a little move on it.

10:57.811 --> 10:58.854
Right.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.464
Calleigh.

11:25.965 --> 11:27.883
I guess if you're here that means, uh...

11:27.925 --> 11:30.261
Yeah. I finished my proficiencies.

11:30.302 --> 11:31.428
I think you mean,

11:31.470 --> 11:32.513
<i>my proficiencies.</i>

11:32.554 --> 11:34.390
You know, Eric, I just don't even think

11:34.431 --> 11:36.016
that we need to talk about it.

11:36.058 --> 11:38.269
I really didn't mind
having a refresher course.

11:38.310 --> 11:39.478
It was good for me.

11:42.064 --> 11:43.691
Anyway...

11:44.900 --> 11:47.528
This is terrible. I don't
even know what to say.

11:47.570 --> 11:48.946
Have we got any leads?

11:48.988 --> 11:50.197
I processed all the rounds

11:50.239 --> 11:52.616
from the scene. I ran them
through IBIS. I got zip.

11:52.658 --> 11:54.243
So the only thing we have to go on

11:54.285 --> 11:56.370
is if the shooter left something behind.

11:56.704 --> 11:57.705
Yeah.

11:57.746 --> 12:00.332
Well... the shooter obviously
wasn't perched up there,

12:00.374 --> 12:03.043
because the rods are facing that way.

12:04.461 --> 12:06.422
Right up there at parking structure.

12:10.801 --> 12:11.969
Shall we?

12:18.142 --> 12:19.184
Here we go.

12:19.226 --> 12:21.228
Look at all these casings.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.901
Explains why we couldn't see him.

12:26.942 --> 12:29.904
The sun was right in our eyes
and he used it to his advantage.

12:30.279 --> 12:31.906
We may have a live one!

12:35.200 --> 12:36.827
Down! Go!

12:42.374 --> 12:44.209
Got an unspent round.

12:44.293 --> 12:47.421
There are a bunch of them. It
must've dropped during the chaos.

12:47.463 --> 12:49.548
They're oxidized, too. I
can't see the head stamp.

12:49.590 --> 12:51.133
This could be a nice lead.

12:51.550 --> 12:54.094
I'll run the rest through
prints, see if anything pops.

12:54.136 --> 12:56.931
This is strange. They all look oxidized.

12:57.723 --> 12:58.974
Take a look at this.

12:59.016 --> 13:00.684
It's a piece of a gun grip.

13:00.726 --> 13:02.353
Weapon malfunctioned.

13:02.394 --> 13:04.980
You know, a blast like that
could have injured the shooter.

13:09.944 --> 13:10.986
Horatio,

13:11.028 --> 13:11.946
it's Eric.

13:11.987 --> 13:13.906
Listen, our shooter's
weapon malfunctioned.

13:13.948 --> 13:14.949
He could be injured.

13:14.990 --> 13:15.908
Okay. Here's what we do.

13:15.950 --> 13:17.201
Canvas all ERs.

13:17.243 --> 13:18.285
Let's do it right now.

13:18.327 --> 13:21.497
All right, I'll tell them we're
looking for someone with powder burns.

13:26.961 --> 13:29.338
Hey, good to see you again, Red.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.257
It really is. This place...

13:31.340 --> 13:33.968
is starting to feel
like a second home to me.

13:35.094 --> 13:36.178
So...

13:36.679 --> 13:39.390
what kinda two-bit beef you
got conjured up this time?

13:39.473 --> 13:42.518
I am working on a double homicide, Ron,

13:42.559 --> 13:45.521
in which the killer's gun malfunctioned,

13:45.604 --> 13:49.650
resulting in the type of powder
burn that you are sporting

13:49.817 --> 13:51.443
on your neck.

13:51.610 --> 13:53.320
Oh, well, I fired a gun recently.

13:53.362 --> 13:54.822
Yes, I did, at the range,

13:54.863 --> 13:57.575
and I accidentally put
in the wrong size rounds.

13:57.616 --> 14:00.369
So, I got a little
powder burn on the neck.

14:00.411 --> 14:02.371
Yes, you were at the range.

14:03.038 --> 14:05.249
Yeah, well, this day and age,

14:05.291 --> 14:06.792
you want to be prepared,

14:06.834 --> 14:08.502
you know, protect your family.

14:10.212 --> 14:11.672
Family, Ron.

14:12.339 --> 14:14.258
Julia, Kyle.

14:14.425 --> 14:16.844
Like it or not, we are family now.

14:17.553 --> 14:19.555
<i>And I really wouldn't want anyone</i>

14:19.888 --> 14:22.641
to try and take them away from me.

14:26.770 --> 14:29.231
Where is your gun, Ron?

14:29.273 --> 14:30.733
It was useless. I dumped it.

14:30.774 --> 14:32.443
I'm sure it's in some garbage dump.

14:32.484 --> 14:34.695
You know, Ron, that...

14:34.778 --> 14:37.489
seems a tad flimsy to me.

14:38.574 --> 14:39.700
Does it?

14:39.992 --> 14:43.495
I don't think it's as flimsy as
what I got brought in here for.

14:43.996 --> 14:45.581
You want to book me?

14:45.623 --> 14:46.665
Book me.

14:47.207 --> 14:48.667
Otherwise I'm flyin'

14:50.169 --> 14:52.254
I'm gonna find the gun, Ron.

14:59.803 --> 15:01.597
You play the hero,

15:03.015 --> 15:04.767
but it's gotta kill you.

15:04.808 --> 15:06.477
Huh? Deep down...

15:07.353 --> 15:08.771
that you're so bound by the law.

15:08.812 --> 15:09.980
You know, Ron...

15:10.439 --> 15:11.815
justice...

15:12.149 --> 15:14.193
comes in many forms.

15:14.235 --> 15:16.195
So does self-delusion.

15:43.365 --> 15:45.200
Just thought I'd come
in and check on you.

15:46.577 --> 15:48.036
Check on me? Why?

15:49.705 --> 15:50.706
Oh.

15:51.123 --> 15:52.207
Right.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.001
Bullets fly and everyone thinks

15:54.042 --> 15:56.253
I'm supposed to have some
sort of Vietnam flashback?

15:57.212 --> 15:58.380
It goes with the job.

15:58.589 --> 16:01.383
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
you have to get used to it.

16:03.093 --> 16:04.469
Look, I'm fine.

16:05.512 --> 16:07.055
But thanks.

16:07.347 --> 16:08.223
Okay.

16:08.265 --> 16:10.726
What were you cooking up over
there in the fuming chamber?

16:11.935 --> 16:14.146
Hopefully, the identity of our shooter.

16:16.356 --> 16:17.774
I didn't get any viable prints

16:17.816 --> 16:20.736
from the gun grip, so I ran
the prints from the casings.

16:23.614 --> 16:24.990
Brad Gower.

16:25.157 --> 16:26.742
He's got a previous assault charge.

16:31.455 --> 16:33.415
Horatio. Yeah, I've got a name.

16:44.551 --> 16:46.970
Hey! Who are you and how'd
you get past Security?

16:47.012 --> 16:48.972
All-access pass. We're looking
for this guy, Brad Gower.

16:49.014 --> 16:50.807
Brad. Um...

16:51.058 --> 16:51.934
Yeah, sure.

16:51.975 --> 16:53.352
That's me. Can I help you?

16:53.393 --> 16:54.686
Yeah. You sure can.

16:54.895 --> 16:56.605
Turn around and put
your hands on the table.

16:56.647 --> 16:57.898
Turn around!

16:58.815 --> 17:00.317
Whoa! Hey! Whoa...

17:01.652 --> 17:02.903
What's this all about?

17:02.945 --> 17:04.070
He's clean.

17:07.031 --> 17:08.659
Manny Ortega.

17:09.827 --> 17:11.244
Never heard of him. Why?

17:11.286 --> 17:14.665
Your fingerprint was on a bullet
casing connected to his murder.

17:14.873 --> 17:16.541
Okay. Let me stop you right there.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.210
This is a munitions supply company.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.087
My prints are on
thousands of live bullets.

17:20.127 --> 17:22.589
I do spot checks for quality control.

17:29.179 --> 17:31.181
Really? We didn't see a
sign on the front door.

17:31.223 --> 17:32.391
Well, I don't sell to the public.

17:32.432 --> 17:34.351
I'm an independent defense contractor.

17:34.393 --> 17:36.395
You can check my contract with the DoD.

17:36.436 --> 17:38.355
You supply ammunition
to our armed forces?

17:38.397 --> 17:39.481
Not exactly.

17:39.523 --> 17:41.733
The U.S. pays me for
the ammo and then, uh,

17:41.775 --> 17:43.944
distributes it to our
allies around the world.

17:43.986 --> 17:46.363
We supply them, they
help us. It's a win-win.

17:46.405 --> 17:48.448
I find your patriotism inspiring.

17:48.490 --> 17:50.492
I'm more interested in capitalism.

17:50.534 --> 17:51.743
I gotta be honest with you.

17:52.369 --> 17:53.787
Deal's worth over ten mil.

17:53.996 --> 17:55.914
Ten mil for rusty bullets?

17:56.206 --> 17:57.249
Rusty?

17:58.167 --> 18:01.003
Hey. Anything can happen once
these bullets leave my warehouse.

18:01.044 --> 18:02.504
It already has.

18:02.546 --> 18:03.714
Unless you want this on you,

18:03.755 --> 18:06.466
you help us track that rusty
bullet back to your shipment.

18:07.759 --> 18:09.928
Give me the ballistics
info on the round.

18:10.012 --> 18:11.221
I'll do my best.

18:11.555 --> 18:12.639
Good decision.

18:13.974 --> 18:15.058
I'll call Calleigh.

18:56.725 --> 18:57.684
Duquesne.

18:57.726 --> 18:58.936
Hey, Calleigh, this is Frank.

18:59.102 --> 19:01.021
You got anything off
those unspent rounds?

19:01.063 --> 19:03.190
Not yet. I'm just
getting started on them.

19:03.315 --> 19:06.944
I got a guy here that says he
might be able to track the buyer.

19:47.609 --> 19:49.194
Thank God you're okay.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.489
It was crazy.

19:52.531 --> 19:54.783
The bullet just rolled off the table.

19:54.825 --> 19:56.577
Then the lab catches on fire.

19:57.369 --> 20:00.372
Normally bullets don't discharge
when they hit the ground.

20:00.414 --> 20:02.207
I know. It's because they were old.

20:02.249 --> 20:04.751
I should have known something
because of the oxidation.

20:04.793 --> 20:06.628
Don't beat yourself up over it.

20:12.593 --> 20:16.180
Because of me, the entire
case is probably compromised.

20:18.974 --> 20:21.560
There were three unspent
bullets at the scene, right?

20:22.936 --> 20:23.896
Yeah.

20:23.937 --> 20:25.689
How many of them were compromised?

20:26.190 --> 20:27.441
I think two.

20:27.482 --> 20:29.735
There's probably another
one in the rubble.

20:29.902 --> 20:31.486
All right. Let's find it.

21:01.350 --> 21:02.392
Hey.

21:11.151 --> 21:12.653
Here it is.

21:13.028 --> 21:14.279
I found it.

21:14.488 --> 21:16.406
You are my hero.

21:41.348 --> 21:42.432
Success?

21:42.474 --> 21:43.475
Success!

21:43.517 --> 21:46.103
I used my bullet-puller to
neutralize the bullet, so,

21:46.144 --> 21:47.229
let's see what we've got.

21:47.271 --> 21:48.981
So you've got black powder there.

21:49.064 --> 21:50.691
You don't see that much anymore.

21:50.732 --> 21:53.652
I know. It's predominantly
smokeless these days.

21:53.735 --> 21:56.613
It's because they add
stabilizers to make it safe.

21:56.655 --> 21:58.323
Could explain why the
round was unstable.

21:58.365 --> 22:00.033
Yeah, black powder doesn't have that.

22:00.075 --> 22:03.745
No, without the stabilizers, the
powder deteriorates over time.

22:04.246 --> 22:06.915
<i>It becomes acidic, which releases heat.</i>

22:06.957 --> 22:09.793
<i>With nowhere to go, that heat
builds up towards a flashpoint,</i>

22:09.835 --> 22:12.337
<i>and it's just itchin'
for a reason to blow.</i>

22:12.713 --> 22:15.799
Does that explain why the bullets
are so oxidized, is they're old?

22:20.137 --> 22:22.723
Almost 40 years old, to be exact.

22:25.309 --> 22:27.686
This round was made in 1969.

22:28.395 --> 22:29.813
You know what that writing is?

22:29.855 --> 22:30.981
It's cyrillic.

22:31.732 --> 22:34.526
It was manufactured in
a soviet bloc country.

22:34.568 --> 22:36.320
Why are those even in circulation?

22:36.361 --> 22:39.907
It shouldn't be. It's illegal to sell
old ammunition from those countries.

22:40.866 --> 22:43.577
You know, all of this stuff is
coming from Brad Gower's company.

22:43.619 --> 22:44.912
Means he's buying old ammo, and

22:44.953 --> 22:47.456
selling it as new through
his defense contract.

22:47.498 --> 22:50.959
Yep. Collecting it up cheap, selling it
off at a huge profit... it's a nice scam.

22:51.126 --> 22:54.171
Maybe our vic Manny knew about
this... was looking for a payday.

22:54.213 --> 22:56.048
Well, there's only one way to find out.

23:04.806 --> 23:06.225
Hi, Brad.

23:08.143 --> 23:12.481
Put your hands on your head and
get down on your knees right now.

23:16.568 --> 23:18.779
Here's your warrant
to search the premises.

23:18.946 --> 23:20.822
Still after me for those murders?

23:21.198 --> 23:24.159
I already told you, I
just touched those bullets.

23:24.201 --> 23:25.869
Got something over here.

23:27.704 --> 23:30.999
You sure did... right before you
loaded the magazine and fired it.

23:31.083 --> 23:32.292
Nine mill,

23:32.376 --> 23:33.544
cracked grip.

23:33.710 --> 23:35.838
Matches the piece we found at the scene.

23:35.921 --> 23:37.714
Okay, Brad,

23:37.840 --> 23:39.716
this is your chance.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.264
Manny introduced himself.

23:45.722 --> 23:47.891
He said he wanted to
off-load some ammo.

23:47.933 --> 23:49.685
What kind of ammunition?

23:49.726 --> 23:50.811
He said it was some brand new prototype.

23:50.853 --> 23:54.940
Supposed to be the most
dangerous ammo ever made.

23:55.566 --> 23:59.570
It seemed too good to be true,
so I followed him this morning.

24:01.405 --> 24:04.116
<i>The guy he met had "Fed"
written all over him.</i>

24:04.408 --> 24:06.577
<i>I figured Manny was a snitch,</i>

24:06.618 --> 24:10.330
<i>that he was trying to lure me in
with the promise of new bullets</i>

24:10.414 --> 24:14.084
<i>and then deliver me to the Feds
for reselling the rusty ones.</i>

24:14.251 --> 24:15.544
Hey, Ortega.

24:15.919 --> 24:17.629
Brad, what are you doing here?

24:18.172 --> 24:19.590
Where's your friend, Ortega?

24:19.673 --> 24:21.008
- What friend?
- The Fed.

24:21.049 --> 24:22.593
You didn't think I'd see him leave?

24:22.718 --> 24:24.136
You trying to rat me out?

24:24.178 --> 24:26.263
Trying to get me busted on
an illegal weapons charge?

24:26.305 --> 24:28.473
How stupid do you think I am, Ortega?

24:29.349 --> 24:31.435
- Choose.
- Choose? What?

24:31.560 --> 24:33.187
The way you're going to die.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.606
Either you take your
chances with this bullet,

24:35.647 --> 24:37.900
or you spread your
wings, see if you can fly.

24:38.141 --> 24:40.310
No, no, no, no, no.
We can work this out!

24:47.150 --> 24:49.236
I didn't think he'd actually jump.

24:49.986 --> 24:52.739
I couldn't take the chance
that he'd get up again.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.626
I actually thought he was
dead, until you guys arrived.

25:05.377 --> 25:07.379
That woman, she yelled.

25:07.462 --> 25:10.215
Call Fire-Rescue. We
may have a live one.

25:20.559 --> 25:22.853
And that's when you panicked.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.522
I wanted Manny gone.

25:25.564 --> 25:26.940
I didn't mean to kill her.

25:26.982 --> 25:28.817
But you did, Brad,

25:29.359 --> 25:30.736
you did kill her.

25:33.780 --> 25:36.700
Take him direct to booking, please.

25:42.539 --> 25:43.999
Everybody down!

25:54.342 --> 25:55.469
Frank,

25:55.510 --> 25:59.056
this is getting to
be a very nasty habit.

26:11.845 --> 26:13.680
Hey, Frank, where's Horatio?

26:13.722 --> 26:15.223
Mobilizing the troops.

26:15.265 --> 26:17.476
I've got every man out
there looking for that car.

26:17.517 --> 26:20.187
I'm also thinking about
upping my life insurance.

26:20.228 --> 26:23.273
So we've got a drive-by shooter
who only gets off one shot?

26:23.356 --> 26:26.943
Yep. One entry wound, a
couple dozen exit wounds.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.113
You know, I've heard about
these, but I've never seen them.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.073
They're called Fused Alloy rounds.

26:32.115 --> 26:33.742
What makes them so special?

26:33.784 --> 26:37.662
Basically, they're just fragments
of metal put together with heat.

26:37.704 --> 26:39.873
If it comes in contact
with something cold,

26:39.915 --> 26:43.752
such as body armor, it remains
intact and sails right through.

26:46.296 --> 26:49.091
If it comes in contact
with a heat source,

26:49.132 --> 26:51.468
for example, a human being,

26:51.551 --> 26:53.845
the heat reverses the
manufacturing process

26:53.887 --> 26:56.139
and the bullet returns
to its original state.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.808
Fragmenting back into pieces.

27:01.394 --> 27:03.063
It's dual-purpose ammo.

27:03.105 --> 27:05.357
Body armor or not,
either way they got you.

27:05.398 --> 27:07.359
So any shot's a kill shot?

27:07.400 --> 27:08.360
Yeah.

27:08.401 --> 27:11.029
Well, hell, with ammo like that,
ATF ought to be all over that.

27:11.488 --> 27:12.489
You're right.

27:12.531 --> 27:13.949
And I bet they are.

27:20.455 --> 27:22.165
Look, if this is about Manny Ortega

27:22.207 --> 27:23.834
I already told Lieutenant Caine...

27:23.875 --> 27:27.504
The Ortega murder's been
solved. Brad Gower confessed.

27:27.754 --> 27:28.880
Brad Gower?

27:28.922 --> 27:31.842
You've been tracking illegal
munitions in South Florida,

27:31.883 --> 27:36.138
so I figured you knew Brad and his
partner were selling outdated ammo.

27:36.179 --> 27:38.265
Yeah, I knew, but I
looked the other way.

27:38.306 --> 27:41.643
Those bullets are going
overseas and hard reality is,

27:41.685 --> 27:42.894
that's their problem.

27:43.019 --> 27:45.230
I'm worried about the
bigger threat here in Miami.

27:45.355 --> 27:47.023
The Fused Alloy rounds.

27:47.649 --> 27:48.900
Well done.

27:48.942 --> 27:51.194
You go to the head of the class.

27:51.361 --> 27:53.321
They are lethal and illegal.

27:53.363 --> 27:56.032
That makes outlaws the perfect buyers.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.034
Have you been able to
figure out who's making them?

27:58.076 --> 27:59.119
No.

27:59.161 --> 28:01.455
That's why I need to find
out who's buying them.

28:01.496 --> 28:02.747
What about Manny Ortega?

28:02.789 --> 28:04.833
Any idea how he fits in the big picture?

28:04.875 --> 28:08.462
Chatter says he's soliciting
buyers for the munitions maker.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.380
Look, Manny,

28:10.756 --> 28:12.424
I know what you've been doing.

28:12.466 --> 28:14.551
You've been prowling around for buyers.

28:14.801 --> 28:17.304
Buyers for Fused Alloy rounds.

28:17.345 --> 28:19.765
You got the wrong guy, man...

28:19.806 --> 28:20.766
Cut the crap.

28:20.807 --> 28:22.893
All these inquiries you've been making,

28:22.934 --> 28:25.228
hanging out with drug
dealers, rival gangs...

28:25.270 --> 28:26.229
What?

28:26.605 --> 28:28.148
I can't have friends?

28:28.190 --> 28:29.566
Look, you're working for somebody.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.818
You tell me who and I don't make

28:31.902 --> 28:33.570
your very near future a living hell.

28:33.904 --> 28:35.739
I ain't saying squat.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.574
We'll see about that.

28:42.245 --> 28:43.747
You've got till noon tomorrow.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.499
I get a name...

28:45.707 --> 28:47.918
or you don't get a second chance.

28:52.089 --> 28:53.882
You know, Agent Caldwell, in my opinion

28:53.924 --> 28:55.592
you should have protected him.

28:55.967 --> 28:58.386
He got left out in the cold,
that's why he got killed.

28:58.428 --> 29:00.764
A life like his, I'd call it karma.

29:00.806 --> 29:01.848
I guess.

29:01.890 --> 29:03.350
Since you were surveilling Manny,

29:03.391 --> 29:05.227
I imagine you know all of his buyers.

29:05.268 --> 29:07.562
I'd like a list of the
names, if you don't mind.

29:16.196 --> 29:18.532
Anybody asks... I was never here.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.001
I just got a list from ATF

29:30.043 --> 29:32.921
of interested buyers
in Fused Alloy rounds.

29:32.963 --> 29:35.799
Could get us closer
to who shot Brad Gower.

29:35.841 --> 29:36.842
They did their homework.

29:36.883 --> 29:40.554
They cracked the shell corporations
and then tied them to individuals.

29:40.595 --> 29:43.557
There's someone on there
who's very familiar.

29:45.308 --> 29:47.102
Ron Saris.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.357
Thank you, ma'am.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.942
Let me know what I can do.

30:08.957 --> 30:10.625
Okay, you know something, Caine,

30:10.667 --> 30:12.294
I'm really getting sick of this.

30:12.461 --> 30:15.797
You are about five words
away from a harassment suit.

30:16.214 --> 30:17.632
What do you want now?

30:18.383 --> 30:21.219
Brad Gower was just killed
with the same ammunition

30:21.261 --> 30:23.430
that you purchased from Manny Ortega.

30:23.472 --> 30:25.432
What, so someone put
me on a list, who cares?

30:25.474 --> 30:27.058
Anyone could do that. Who?

30:27.100 --> 30:28.435
Manny what?

30:28.643 --> 30:30.353
I never killed a guy called Gower.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.521
I've got an alibi.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.273
You have an alibi?

30:34.191 --> 30:36.651
Yeah, I do, I do. And it's ironclad.

30:36.943 --> 30:38.320
Julia and I...

30:38.695 --> 30:40.113
we just got married.

30:43.116 --> 30:45.577
We're family now. We're legal.

30:45.827 --> 30:48.955
20 smiling people in one
of your fine courtrooms.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.999
Doesn't get any better
than that, does it?

30:58.799 --> 31:00.008
What are you planning to do

31:00.050 --> 31:02.928
with the rest of the
ammunition you purchased, Ron?

31:03.136 --> 31:05.097
Well, hypothetically,

31:05.138 --> 31:08.266
if I were buying up all the bullets,

31:10.477 --> 31:13.355
I'd be using it for only
one thing and one thing only.

31:13.772 --> 31:14.898
Is that a threat?

31:14.940 --> 31:16.483
Don't flatter yourself.

31:17.442 --> 31:21.113
Although it would be a lot
easier on Kyle come Father's Day.

31:22.906 --> 31:24.032
Ron...

31:24.491 --> 31:26.493
you're going to be dead by Father's Day.

31:48.932 --> 31:51.393
I guess congratulations are in order.

31:56.356 --> 31:57.607
You heard.

32:00.485 --> 32:03.697
The wedding was a little
spur-of-the-moment.

32:03.864 --> 32:05.449
Does Kyle know?

32:07.159 --> 32:08.326
Is that why you've come?

32:08.368 --> 32:11.329
To lecture me about
who I should be seeing?

32:12.998 --> 32:16.084
Julia, Ron is after your money.

32:16.126 --> 32:16.835
My money?

32:16.877 --> 32:21.298
The money you've amassed over
the years of doing what you do.

32:21.590 --> 32:22.674
Really?

32:23.300 --> 32:24.551
And what is that?

32:24.760 --> 32:27.637
When you're gone, he will
eliminate the one thing

32:27.679 --> 32:30.223
that stands between him and that money.

32:30.265 --> 32:32.017
You're talking about Kyle.

32:32.058 --> 32:34.352
You don't think I considered that?

32:34.394 --> 32:36.646
I am not going to let that happen.

32:37.773 --> 32:39.024
You don't have a choice.

32:39.065 --> 32:41.234
Where the boy is concerned, I do.

32:44.404 --> 32:45.906
What are you proposing?

32:45.947 --> 32:47.407
Do not go back home.

32:47.449 --> 32:51.411
You meet me at Miami Shores
airstrip at 5:00 p. m. today.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.718
The boy is innocent.

33:11.139 --> 33:13.266
We'll be there at 5:00.

33:20.649 --> 33:22.067
What's going on, Dad?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.735
I need to talk to you.

33:24.027 --> 33:25.237
This looks serious.

33:25.278 --> 33:26.446
It is serious.

33:27.447 --> 33:28.865
Is it about Ron again?

33:28.907 --> 33:30.283
It's about Ron.

33:30.992 --> 33:33.036
Now listen to me. I
need you and your mother

33:33.078 --> 33:34.955
to leave the country for a while.

33:36.039 --> 33:37.791
What do you mean, for a
while? How long is a while?

33:37.833 --> 33:39.543
For as long as it takes.

33:41.128 --> 33:44.005
Look, it took me my
entire life to meet you.

33:44.047 --> 33:46.007
Okay, now you just want to send me away?

33:46.049 --> 33:48.718
Someday you will
understand what I am doing.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.304
That's what they all say,
and then they're just gone.

33:51.346 --> 33:53.223
I need you to trust me.

33:54.850 --> 33:57.018
Yeah, they all say that, too.

34:11.992 --> 34:13.493
Air One to ground units:

34:13.534 --> 34:15.996
suspect vehicle in the
drive-by shooting located

34:16.036 --> 34:18.290
at Bayfront Park Metromover stop.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.949
This is the car from
the drive-by shooting?

34:43.992 --> 34:46.703
Yeah, patrol found it five
blocks from the crime scene.

34:46.744 --> 34:47.704
Fortunately,...

34:47.786 --> 34:49.664
Horatio left his calling card.

34:49.956 --> 34:51.331
You find anything else?

34:51.791 --> 34:53.626
No, unfortunately not.

34:53.835 --> 34:55.628
There were no prints, no trace.

34:55.670 --> 34:57.964
Whoever ditched the car got
rid of the license plates,

34:58.006 --> 35:00.341
took off the VIN number
and they left the keys.

35:00.383 --> 35:02.427
I bet they wanted it to get stolen.

35:05.138 --> 35:07.140
So, where does that leave us?

35:07.181 --> 35:09.267
Well, a car like this will
have a navigation system

35:09.309 --> 35:11.686
that I bet is linked to Bluetooth.

35:11.728 --> 35:14.981
Bluetooth so a driver can talk
on their cell phone hands-free?

35:15.023 --> 35:17.400
Exactly. And if the shooter
paired his cell phone with

35:17.442 --> 35:19.861
the car, the navigation
system will have record of it.

35:19.903 --> 35:22.238
And the number will be
stored in the system's memory.

35:39.172 --> 35:40.632
Look whose number's up.

35:43.801 --> 35:45.220
Colin Madison,

35:45.261 --> 35:47.472
you worked with Brad Gower.

35:47.847 --> 35:48.890
Yes, I did...

35:49.474 --> 35:50.600
until today.

35:50.892 --> 35:52.101
Until you killed him.

35:52.227 --> 35:53.228
Me?

35:53.311 --> 35:56.731
There was a drive-by, one
shot. Unfortunately, for you,

35:57.148 --> 35:59.150
we can put you in that car.

36:02.237 --> 36:04.155
No. No, no. No way. No.

36:04.197 --> 36:06.366
Now see, I bet you think
you got away with it

36:06.407 --> 36:08.660
because you cleaned your
car, but here's the thing.

36:08.701 --> 36:10.912
It's your navigation
system that gave you away.

36:10.954 --> 36:12.580
It's hooked into your Bluetooth,

36:12.622 --> 36:14.123
which is linked to your cell phone.

36:14.165 --> 36:16.209
Put your cell phone on the table, Colin.

36:24.092 --> 36:26.135
Hey, listen, I just realized
I'm late for something.

36:26.177 --> 36:27.178
I gotta go.

36:27.220 --> 36:28.346
What's going on?

36:28.388 --> 36:30.765
Um, I can't explain right now.

36:30.807 --> 36:32.225
I'll talk to you later.

36:40.275 --> 36:41.568
Colin, here's the thing.

36:41.609 --> 36:42.860
I know that you killed Brad,

36:42.902 --> 36:44.862
I just don't know why.

36:44.904 --> 36:46.948
You're cheating the government
on the defense contract,

36:46.990 --> 36:48.825
you're making money hand over fist.

36:48.866 --> 36:50.577
You mean, Brad was making the money.

36:50.618 --> 36:53.454
I was on an hourly.
He wouldn't cut me in.

36:53.496 --> 36:54.664
So you wanted him out?

36:54.706 --> 36:56.332
You're trying to muscle
into the business?

36:56.374 --> 36:57.458
Not at all.

36:58.167 --> 36:59.961
I wanted to live.

37:01.045 --> 37:03.506
This morning, a guy burst
into my office with a gun

37:03.548 --> 37:04.716
pointed at me.

37:06.217 --> 37:07.635
You Brad Gower?

37:09.053 --> 37:11.681
I had to try and convince
him I wasn't Brad.

37:11.764 --> 37:13.099
What'd he ask you?

37:13.266 --> 37:14.559
He didn't ask me anything.

37:14.767 --> 37:18.479
He told me. Said if I didn't
kill Brad, I'd be next.

37:18.521 --> 37:20.398
He even gave me the
bullet to use on him.

37:20.732 --> 37:22.025
Why would he do that?

37:22.275 --> 37:24.027
Said he had a score to settle.

37:24.944 --> 37:27.322
Look, I know the guy
meant business, so...

37:28.364 --> 37:29.657
I did it.

37:39.417 --> 37:41.336
Everybody down!

37:48.259 --> 37:49.969
Do you know his name?

37:50.303 --> 37:51.888
Know his name?

37:53.181 --> 37:54.432
Make me a deal,

37:55.350 --> 37:56.601
and I take you to him.

37:57.477 --> 38:00.480
Dispatch, SWAT's making
entry, 144 Tenth Street.

38:00.521 --> 38:02.941
10-4, Air 21. Respond.

38:05.902 --> 38:08.446
Get down! Get down! Get down!

38:11.199 --> 38:14.160
Move, move, move!
Let's move! Go, go, go!

38:14.202 --> 38:17.163
Get down! Get down! Get
down! Get your hands up!

38:17.205 --> 38:18.373
Hands up!

38:26.381 --> 38:29.133
It's quite a performance
you put on this morning.

38:29.592 --> 38:31.594
You came to claim Manny's stuff,

38:31.719 --> 38:33.972
look for anything that
might incriminate you.

38:34.013 --> 38:35.932
Yeah, you can never be too careful.

38:36.182 --> 38:38.226
So your brother worked for you.

38:38.601 --> 38:39.686
Yeah.

38:40.436 --> 38:42.730
He really surprised me, you know?

38:43.398 --> 38:45.275
Did very well for himself.

38:46.067 --> 38:47.902
I was very proud of him.

38:47.944 --> 38:51.239
I guess that means he warranted
a revenge killing, then.

38:53.741 --> 38:56.202
You'd kill for your
family, wouldn't you?

39:02.375 --> 39:04.586
How many rounds of this ammunition

39:04.627 --> 39:06.796
would you say is out on the street?

39:07.046 --> 39:08.172
The Alloy?

39:09.674 --> 39:11.009
I don't know.

39:12.802 --> 39:16.139
None... some... a lot.

39:17.015 --> 39:19.267
We got you on multiple charges.

39:19.392 --> 39:20.935
Might as well talk, Juan.

39:20.977 --> 39:22.145
No, see,

39:22.520 --> 39:24.355
I believe in self-preservation,

39:24.397 --> 39:26.941
which is something you ought
to think about, Lieutenant.

39:27.191 --> 39:30.987
'Cause by taking me down, you're
gonna make a lot of people angry.

39:32.238 --> 39:35.366
So consider yourself warned.

39:38.077 --> 39:39.245
Take him.

39:52.550 --> 39:53.718
What time is it?

39:55.011 --> 39:56.012
What?

39:56.262 --> 39:58.056
What time? What time is it?

39:58.556 --> 40:00.016
It's 4:00.

40:01.267 --> 40:02.727
I'll be right back.

40:02.852 --> 40:04.479
I need to take care of something.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.814
Where are you going? Dad said
he was gonna meet us in an hour.

40:06.856 --> 40:08.274
Don't worry about Horatio.

40:08.316 --> 40:10.902
Just stay here and don't use the phone.

40:12.904 --> 40:14.781
- Be careful, Mom.
- I will.

40:27.835 --> 40:30.213
<i>Si, Horatio Caine.</i>

40:30.588 --> 40:32.882
I want to know when it's done.

42:55.233 --> 42:58.903
It's done.
