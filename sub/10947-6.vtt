00:11.300 --> 00:15.350
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.430 --> 00:18.730
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.770 --> 00:23.690
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

00:23.780 --> 00:25.610
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.690 --> 00:26.990
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:31.200
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:32.870
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.250
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.330 --> 00:38.000
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:42.250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:08.110 --> 01:10.580
Great. You're back. What's for dinner?

01:10.660 --> 01:12.080
We've got a few options.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.160
First, round nuts and some kind of
oval-shaped nuts.

01:16.250 --> 01:19.540
And some rock-shaped nuts
that might just be rocks.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.380
Dig in.

01:23.590 --> 01:26.050
Seriously, what else you got?

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
( PURRING )

01:32.970 --> 01:33.970

01:34.270 --> 01:35.980
SOKKA: What was that?

01:39.440 --> 01:40.900
( BOOM )

01:41.110 --> 01:43.780
AANG: It's coming from over there.

01:43.860 --> 01:47.820
SOKKA: Shouldn't we run away from
huge booms, not toward them?

01:50.240 --> 01:51.700
( PURRING )

01:57.580 --> 01:58.580
Hyah.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.210
An earthbender.

02:00.290 --> 02:01.460
Let's go meet him.

02:01.540 --> 02:04.000
He looks dangerous,
so we better approach cautiously.

02:04.210 --> 02:06.260
Hello there! I'm Katara.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.760
What's your name?

02:07.840 --> 02:09.180
Ah!

02:16.390 --> 02:17.980
AANG: Nice to meet you!

02:18.180 --> 02:19.850
I just wanted to say hi.

02:20.060 --> 02:22.310
Hey, that guy's
got to be running somewhere.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.940
Maybe we're near a village.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.360
And I bet that village has a market.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.450
Which means no nuts for dinner.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.610
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts.

02:30.820 --> 02:31.910
( PURRING )

02:32.120 --> 02:33.490
Yeah, I hate them, too.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.460
AANG: Great hat.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.090
I'll trade you some nuts for it.

02:48.470 --> 02:49.840
Hey!

02:51.050 --> 02:52.180
Hi, Mom.

02:52.260 --> 02:53.470
Where have you been, Haru?

02:53.550 --> 02:54.550
You're late!

02:54.680 --> 02:56.390
Get started on your chores.

02:56.470 --> 02:58.270
Hey! You're that kid.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.350
Ah!

02:59.430 --> 03:00.480
Why did you run away before?

03:00.560 --> 03:03.360
Uh... You must have me confused
with some other kid.

03:03.770 --> 03:06.190
No, she doesn't.
We saw you earthbending.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.820
They saw you doing what?

03:10.030 --> 03:11.400
They're crazy, Mom.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.990
I mean, look at how they're dressed.

03:15.030 --> 03:17.330
You know how dangerous that is.

03:17.410 --> 03:20.620
You know what would happen
if they caught you earthbending.

03:20.710 --> 03:22.040
MAN: Open up!

03:22.120 --> 03:23.120
( LOUD KNOCKING )

03:25.040 --> 03:26.670
SOKKA: Fire Nation. Act natural.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.680
Aah!

03:38.260 --> 03:41.180
What do you want?
I've already paid you this week.

03:41.270 --> 03:42.850
The tax just doubled.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.190
We wouldn't want an accident,
would we?

03:45.940 --> 03:49.530
Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

03:57.660 --> 03:59.620
You can keep the copper ones.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.420
Nice guy.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.290
How long has
the Fire Nation been here?

04:07.590 --> 04:10.260
Five years. Fire Lord Ozai

04:10.340 --> 04:13.090
uses our town's coal mines
to fuel his ships.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.720
They're thugs. They steal from us.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.550
And everyone here
is too much of a coward

04:17.760 --> 04:18.890
to do anything about it.

04:18.970 --> 04:20.010
Quiet, Haru!

04:20.220 --> 04:21.560
Don't talk like that!

04:21.640 --> 04:23.020
But Haru's an earthbender.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.100
He can help.

04:24.310 --> 04:26.310
Earthbending is forbidden.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.650
It's caused nothing
but misery for this village.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.110
He must never use his abilities.

04:31.530 --> 04:32.780
How can you say that?

04:32.990 --> 04:34.570
Haru has a gift.

04:34.780 --> 04:36.200
Asking him not to earthbend

04:36.410 --> 04:38.580
is like asking me not to waterbend.

04:38.660 --> 04:39.950
It's a part of who we are.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.740
You don't understand.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.910
I understand that Haru can help
you fight back.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.500
What can the Fire Nation do to you

04:46.580 --> 04:48.000
that they haven't done already?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.630
They could take Haru away,

04:50.840 --> 04:52.550
like they took his father.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.560
HARU: My mom said
you can sleep here tonight.

05:02.890 --> 05:04.640
But you should leave in the morning.

05:04.730 --> 05:07.520
Thanks. I'll make sure
Appa doesn't eat all your hay.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.650
KATARA: I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.200
I didn't know about your father.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.620
HARU: That's ok.

05:18.950 --> 05:22.240
It's funny. The way you were talking
back in the store,

05:22.330 --> 05:24.200
it reminded me of him.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.290
Thanks.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.000
My father was very courageous.

05:27.210 --> 05:28.960
When the Fire Nation invaded,

05:29.170 --> 05:31.590
he and the other earthbenders
were outnumbered ten to one.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.170
But they fought back anyway.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.170
He sounds like a great man.

05:36.090 --> 05:38.640
After the attack,
they rounded up my father

05:38.720 --> 05:40.390
and every other earthbender

05:40.470 --> 05:43.470
and took them away.
We haven't seen them since.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.640
So that's why
you hide your earthbending.

05:45.730 --> 05:46.730
Yeah.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.060
The problem is,

05:49.270 --> 05:52.650
the only way I can feel close
to my father now

05:52.730 --> 05:54.860
is when I practice my bending.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.900
He taught me everything I know.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.370
See this necklace?

06:01.570 --> 06:02.910
My mother gave it to me.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.290
It's beautiful.

06:04.370 --> 06:07.370
I lost my mother
in a Fire Nation raid.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.000
This necklace is all
I have left of her.

06:09.210 --> 06:11.210
It's not enough, is it?

06:11.290 --> 06:12.460
No.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.220
Aah! Help!

06:19.300 --> 06:20.300
The mine!

06:20.390 --> 06:22.100
Aah...

06:23.390 --> 06:24.850
Help me!

06:26.270 --> 06:27.640
( MOANING )

06:27.730 --> 06:29.140
( RUMBLING )

06:31.190 --> 06:32.770
Ah! It's not working.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.150
We have to get help.

06:34.230 --> 06:36.780
There's no time. Pull harder!

06:36.860 --> 06:39.450
Haru, there's a way you can help him.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.780
I can't.

06:40.910 --> 06:42.990
Please. There's no one around
to see you.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.450
It's the only way!

06:53.960 --> 06:55.090
Ah!

06:57.460 --> 06:58.720
Haru, you did it!

07:05.310 --> 07:07.140
( PURRING )

07:07.470 --> 07:09.850
It was so brave of Haru
to use his earthbending

07:09.930 --> 07:11.100
to help that old man.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.440
You must have really inspired him.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
I guess so.

07:14.770 --> 07:16.070
Everyone should get some sleep.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.230
We're leaving at dawn.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.280
Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?

07:19.490 --> 07:20.780
Absolutely not!

07:20.860 --> 07:22.910
This village is crawling
with Fire Nation troops.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.740
If they discover you're here, Aang,

07:24.820 --> 07:26.330
we'll be eating fireballs
for breakfast.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.580
Good night.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.870
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.290
Good night.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.960
( LAUGHING )

07:53.980 --> 07:55.020
Ah!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.230
That's him!

07:56.310 --> 07:58.270
That's the earthbender!

07:58.360 --> 07:59.730
Aah!

08:28.140 --> 08:29.140
They took him!

08:29.350 --> 08:31.560
- They took Haru away!
- What?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.520
The old man turned him in
to the Fire Nation.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.900
It's all my fault.
I forced him into earthbending.

08:35.980 --> 08:38.560
Slow down, Katara.
When did this happen?

08:38.690 --> 08:41.440
Haru's mother said
they came for him at midnight.

08:41.530 --> 08:43.190
Then it's too late to track him.
He's long gone.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.650
We don't need to track him.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.240
The Fire Nation is going to
take me right to Haru.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.870
And why would they do that?

08:49.950 --> 08:53.160
Because they're going to arrest me
for earthbending.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.080
I thought you were
crazy at first, Katara,

08:58.170 --> 08:59.250
but this might work.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.460
There are ventilation shafts
throughout these mines.

09:01.550 --> 09:03.210
All Aang has to do is
send an air current

09:03.300 --> 09:05.130
from that vent to this one right here.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.550
The boulder levitates and ta-da...

09:07.640 --> 09:08.930
Fake earthbending.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.430
Aang, did you get all that?

09:10.510 --> 09:12.560
Sure, sure. I got it.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.140
Do you remember your cue?

09:14.230 --> 09:16.230
Yeah, yeah. Just relax.

09:16.310 --> 09:18.150
You're taking all the fun out of this.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.820
By "this" do you mean
intentionally being captured

09:20.900 --> 09:22.730
by an army of ruthless firebenders?

09:22.820 --> 09:25.280
Exactly. That's fun stuff.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.910
SOKKA: Here they come.
Get in your places.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.910
Uh! Get out of my way, pipsqueak.

09:32.990 --> 09:37.500
How dare you call me pipsqueak,
you giant-eared cretin?

09:37.580 --> 09:39.130
What did you call me?

09:39.210 --> 09:41.250
A giant-eared cretin.

09:41.340 --> 09:42.670
Look at those things.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.170
Do herds of animals
use them for shade?

09:45.260 --> 09:47.340
You better back off!

09:47.430 --> 09:48.590
Seriously, back off.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.470
I will not back off!

09:50.550 --> 09:52.050
I bet elephants get together

09:52.140 --> 09:55.020
and make fun of
how large your ears are.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.520
That's it! You're going down.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.850
I'll show you who's boss,

10:00.060 --> 10:02.440
earthbending style.

10:05.570 --> 10:09.160
I said, "earthbending style!"

10:12.990 --> 10:15.910
That lemur. He's earthbending.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.960
No, you idiot. It's the girl.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.420
Oh. Of course.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.880
I'll hold her!

10:25.250 --> 10:27.220
( WHISPERING ) You've got 12 hours
to find Haru.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.180
We'll be right behind you.

10:37.020 --> 10:39.520
Momo, you have some big ears.

10:39.730 --> 10:40.770
( PURRING )

11:18.100 --> 11:21.560
She'll be fine, Aang.
Katara knows what she's doing.

11:28.860 --> 11:32.700
MAN: Earthbenders,
it is my pleasure to welcome you

11:32.780 --> 11:35.030
aboard my modest shipyard.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.540
I am your warden.

11:37.620 --> 11:40.960
I prefer to think of you
not as prisoners,

11:41.040 --> 11:43.330
but as honored guests.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.630
And I hope you come to think of me

11:45.710 --> 11:49.380
as your humble and caring host.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.590
You will succeed here
if you simply abide...

11:52.680 --> 11:54.010
( COUGHING )

11:55.680 --> 11:56.850
Hyah!

11:58.560 --> 12:02.480
What kind of guest dishonors his host
by interrupting him?

12:02.560 --> 12:03.980
Take him below.

12:04.190 --> 12:08.020
One week in solitary
will improve his manners.

12:08.110 --> 12:11.650
Simply treat me with the courtesy
I give you

12:11.740 --> 12:15.320
and we'll get along famously.

12:15.490 --> 12:17.740
You will notice, earthbenders,

12:17.830 --> 12:21.250
that this rig is made
entirely of metal.

12:21.370 --> 12:25.290
You are miles away
from any rock or earth.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.460
So, if you have any illusions
about employing

12:28.540 --> 12:31.710
that brutish savagery
that passes for bending

12:31.800 --> 12:34.720
among you people, forget them.

12:35.470 --> 12:38.010
It is impossible.

12:39.060 --> 12:40.430
Good day.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.120
Katara?

13:07.210 --> 13:08.330
Haru!

13:08.420 --> 13:09.500
What are you doing here?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.960
It's my fault you were captured.

13:12.170 --> 13:13.630
I came to rescue you.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.630
So you got yourself arrested?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.680
It was the only way to find you.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.220
You've got guts, Katara.
I'll give you that.

13:20.430 --> 13:23.310
Come on. There's someone
I want you to meet.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.440
Katara, this is my father, Tyro.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.690
Dad, this is Katara.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.070
It's an honor to meet you.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.530
Have some dinner, Katara.

13:36.860 --> 13:37.860
Ew.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.030
It's not as bad as it looks.

13:42.490 --> 13:43.620
Eew!

13:43.700 --> 13:45.620
It's still pretty bad, though.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.330
Tyro, the prisoners are complaining

13:47.420 --> 13:49.250
there aren't enough blankets
to go around.

13:49.330 --> 13:50.920
I'll talk to the guards.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.960
In the meantime, make sure
the elderly are taken care of.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.720
The rest of us will simply have to
hope for warmer weather.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.220
If you don't mind me asking,

13:58.300 --> 13:59.510
what's your escape plan?

13:59.590 --> 14:00.590
Excuse me?

14:00.850 --> 14:03.310
You know, the plan
to get everyone off the rig?

14:03.390 --> 14:05.100
What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?

14:05.180 --> 14:08.310
The plan? The plan is to survive,

14:08.390 --> 14:10.940
wait out this war, hope that one day

14:11.020 --> 14:13.860
some of us can get back home
and forget this ever happened.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.820
How can you say that?

14:15.900 --> 14:17.400
You sound like
you've already given up.

14:17.610 --> 14:20.410
Katara, I admire your courage.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.580
And I envy your youth.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.200
But people's lives are at stake here.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.540
The warden is a ruthless man,

14:27.620 --> 14:29.960
and he won't stand for any rebellion.

14:30.210 --> 14:33.090
I'm sorry, but we're powerless.

14:33.590 --> 14:34.670
We'll see about that.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.510
Earthbenders!

14:40.590 --> 14:43.300
You don't know me, but I know of you.

14:43.390 --> 14:46.640
Every child in my water tribe village
was rocked to sleep

14:46.720 --> 14:49.060
with stories of the brave
Earth Kingdom

14:49.270 --> 14:52.190
and the courageous earthbenders
who guard its borders.

14:52.730 --> 14:54.770
Some of you may think
that the Fire Nation

14:54.860 --> 14:56.320
has made you powerless.

14:56.690 --> 14:59.570
Yes. They have taken away
your ability to bend.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.070
But they can't take away your courage.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.580
And it is your courage
they should truly fear,

15:04.660 --> 15:06.990
because it runs deeper than any mine

15:07.080 --> 15:08.540
you've been forced to dig,

15:08.620 --> 15:11.210
any ocean that keeps you
far from home.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.130
It is the strength of your hearts

15:13.210 --> 15:14.710
that make you who you are,

15:14.790 --> 15:18.170
hearts that will remain unbroken
when all rock and stone

15:18.260 --> 15:19.470
has eroded away.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.180
The time to fight back is now!

15:22.380 --> 15:25.470
I can tell you
the Avatar has returned!

15:25.550 --> 15:27.720
So remember your courage,
earthbenders!

15:27.810 --> 15:30.230
Let us fight for our freedom!

15:32.390 --> 15:33.850
( MAN COUGHING )

16:04.090 --> 16:05.090
Ah!

16:05.390 --> 16:06.390
Shh.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.810
Your 12 hours are up. Where is Haru?

16:11.890 --> 16:13.100
We've got to get out of here.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.020
I can't.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.520
We don't have much time.
There are guards everywhere.

16:17.610 --> 16:18.900
Get on!

16:19.110 --> 16:20.690
Katara, what's wrong?

16:20.940 --> 16:22.400
I'm not leaving.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.990
I'm not giving up on these people.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.330
SOKKA: What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.500
We can't abandon these people.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.210
There has to be a way to help them.

16:37.290 --> 16:40.210
Maybe she's right.
What do you say, Sokka?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.880
I say you're both crazy.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.180
Last chance. We need to leave now.

16:46.510 --> 16:47.510
No.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.260
I hate when you get like this.

16:50.350 --> 16:51.720
Come on, we better hide.

16:53.770 --> 16:54.770
( WHISPERING ) Go.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.400
Look!

17:01.150 --> 17:03.900
Tell me exactly what you saw.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.910
Well, sir, it looked like
a flying bison.

17:05.990 --> 17:06.990
What?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.990
It was a giant, flying buffalo, sir,

17:09.070 --> 17:10.120
with an empty saddle.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.160
Which was it, a buffalo or a bison?

17:13.250 --> 17:16.040
I'm not sure what the difference is,

17:16.120 --> 17:18.080
but that's not really the point,
is it, sir?

17:18.170 --> 17:21.210
I'll decide what the point is, fool!

17:21.300 --> 17:23.460
Aah!

17:23.550 --> 17:24.800
( SPLASH )

17:24.920 --> 17:28.840
You! Wake up the captain!
Search the entire rig!

17:28.930 --> 17:30.220
- Sir.
- What?

17:30.300 --> 17:33.770
That was the captain
you just threw overboard, so...

17:33.850 --> 17:36.190
Then wake up someone
I haven't thrown overboard

17:36.270 --> 17:37.600
and search the rig.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.770
There's something going on here,
and I don't like it.

17:46.110 --> 17:47.490
( PURRING )

17:48.320 --> 17:51.240
We don't have much time.
What are we gonna do?

17:51.330 --> 17:53.160
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.250
The warden would run away,
and we would steal his keys.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.670
Wouldn't he just
take his keys with him?

17:59.750 --> 18:01.840
I'm just tossing ideas around.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.090
I tried talking the earthbenders

18:03.170 --> 18:05.630
into fighting back,
but it didn't work.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.720
If there was just a way
to help them help themselves.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.300
For that they need some kind of
earth or some rock,

18:12.850 --> 18:14.310
something they can bend.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.100
But this entire place
is made of metal.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.110
No, it's not. Look at the smoke.

18:21.980 --> 18:24.020
I bet they're burning coal.

18:24.110 --> 18:25.480
In other words...

18:25.730 --> 18:27.030
Earth.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.370
It's almost dawn.
We're running out of time.

18:33.450 --> 18:34.950
You sure this is gonna work?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.160
It should.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.830
These vents reminded me
of our little trick

18:37.910 --> 18:39.080
back at the village.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.210
We're gonna do the same thing,
but on a much bigger scale.

18:42.290 --> 18:45.000
There's a huge deposit of coal
at the base of this island.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.800
And the whole system is ventilated.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.090
Aang closed off
all the vents except one.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.380
When he does his airbending,

18:50.470 --> 18:52.180
the coal only has one place to go...

18:52.260 --> 18:53.430
Right back here.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.260
MAN: There's the intruder!

18:55.470 --> 18:57.430
Stay back! I'm warning you!

18:57.640 --> 19:00.600
Katara, stop.
You can't win this fight.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.610
Listen to him well, child.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.690
You're one mistake away

19:07.780 --> 19:10.070
from dying where you stand.

19:28.510 --> 19:30.590
( COUGHING )

19:30.670 --> 19:32.800
Here's your chance, earthbenders!

19:33.010 --> 19:35.470
Take it!
Your fate is in your own hands!

19:40.230 --> 19:41.730
( WARDEN LAUGHING )

19:44.400 --> 19:45.810
Foolish girl.

19:46.020 --> 19:48.610
You thought a few inspirational words

19:48.820 --> 19:52.280
and some coal
would change these people?

19:52.360 --> 19:56.410
Look at these blank hopeless faces.

19:56.490 --> 19:59.500
Their spirits were broken
a long time ago.

19:59.700 --> 20:03.170
Oh, but you still believed in them.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.420
How sweet.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.090
They're a waste of your energy,
little girl.

20:09.170 --> 20:11.630
You failed.

20:15.590 --> 20:16.640
Grr.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.680
Hyah!

20:25.690 --> 20:27.230
Show no mercy!

20:30.150 --> 20:31.820
Aah!

20:31.900 --> 20:32.950
For the Earth Kingdom,

20:33.030 --> 20:34.410

21:17.530 --> 21:19.280
Guys, throw me some coal!

21:33.260 --> 21:36.590
No, please. I can't swim.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.300
Don't worry. I hear cowards float.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.970
( SCREAMING )

21:49.940 --> 21:52.230
I want to thank you for saving me,

21:52.320 --> 21:53.610
for saving us.

21:53.820 --> 21:55.650
All it took was a little coal.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.160
It wasn't the coal, Katara.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.700
It was you.

21:59.910 --> 22:02.410
Thank you for helping me
find my courage,

22:02.490 --> 22:04.160
Katara of the water tribe.

22:04.370 --> 22:06.910
My family and everyone here

22:07.120 --> 22:08.870
owes you much.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.420
So, I guess you're going home now.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.050
Yes, to take back my village.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.470
To take back all of our villages!

22:16.670 --> 22:18.720

they set foot on our land!

( CHEERING )

22:21.970 --> 22:23.140
Come with us.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.350
I can't.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.310
Your mission
is to take back your home.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.060
Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.

22:30.150 --> 22:32.190
That's him, isn't it? The Avatar.

22:34.980 --> 22:38.030
Katara, thank you for bringing
my father back to me.

22:38.110 --> 22:40.280
I never thought I'd see him again.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.030
I only wish there was some way...

22:42.240 --> 22:43.870
I know.

22:43.950 --> 22:46.450
My mother's necklace! It's gone!
