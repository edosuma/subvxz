06:16.126 --> 06:18.795
WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM
VERY PRACTICAL.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.463
YOU SHOULD WRITE ABOUT THIS.

SO WHAT WAS I DOING

TO ASK ME OUT?

INSPIRE YOUR ARTICLE.

WHICH IS TO SAY,
HELP FIND YOU A BOYFRIEND.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.869

AND SOMEONE SPECIAL, PLEASE.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.418
THANK YOU, MOM,
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR "SOMEONE SPECIAL," OKAY?

07:39.418 --> 07:40.919
NOT RIGHT NOW, ANYWAY.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.213
THAT JUST MIGHT BE
UP TO THIS LITTLE ANGEL HERE.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.508
OH!

07:48.635 --> 07:49.761
GOT IT!

08:00.521 --> 08:02.941
AND THEN

08:02.941 --> 08:04.401
CARVED THE ANGEL
FOR THIS ACTRESS HE FELL FOR,

08:04.401 --> 08:07.154
BUT, IN THE END, HE MARRIED
MY GREAT-GRANDMA MAGGIE...

08:07.154 --> 08:08.529
AND GAVE THE ANGEL TO HER.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.490
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
WRITE ABOUT IT.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.367
MAYBE THE THING WITH YOUR
GREAT-GRANDPA AND THE ACTRESS

08:12.367 --> 08:14.161
WAS REALLY ROMANTIC...

08:14.161 --> 08:15.954
OR, BETTER YET, TRAGIC!

08:15.954 --> 08:18.039
THE PROBLEM IS,
NO ONE KNOWS MUCH ABOUT IT.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.041
ACCORDING TO MY MOM,
HE NEVER TALKED
ABOUT THE ACTRESS.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.544

08:23.544 --> 08:25.130

12:12.106 --> 12:15.527
THANK YOU!
RIGHT BACK AT YOU, MR. NEW
VICE PRESIDENT OF ADVERTISING.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.820
WE SHOULD GO OUT
AND CELEBRATE OUR VICTORIES.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.906
CAFE SOLANA?
TOMORROW NIGHT?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.616
DOESN'T THAT PLACE HAVE,
LIKE, A SIX-MONTH WAIT?

12:21.616 --> 12:22.992
THE OWNER'S
AN OLD FAMILY FRIEND.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.412
THAT'S A REALLY
TEMPTING OFFER,
THANK YOU,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.121
BUT I'VE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.248
NO PROBLEM.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.999
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
LET ME KNOW.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.587
"I'VE GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO?"

12:33.587 --> 12:35.838
WHAT?
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH
SOMEONE I WORK WITH.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.091
STEVE WORKED HERE.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.634
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.177
I GOTTA GO...
3,000 WORDS TO WRITE!

12:41.177 --> 12:42.387
( BOTH LAUGH )

13:06.077 --> 13:08.538
SO, I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW MY GREAT-GRANDPA
MET THIS ACTRESS,

13:08.538 --> 13:11.374
WHO SHE WAS,
WHY HE CARVED
THE ANGEL FOR HER,

13:11.374 --> 13:13.126
AND WHY THEY BROKE UP.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.128
PIECE OF CAKE, RIGHT?

13:15.128 --> 13:18.381
MY MONEY'S ON YOU...
AND THE MAGIC ANGEL YOU CARRY
AROUND WITH YOU, OF COURSE.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.758
OH, STOP IT.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.050
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE IT AT WORK.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.260
IT'S NOT MAGIC.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.428
UGH, I FORGOT...

13:23.428 --> 13:25.597
I PROMISED I'D GO
TO THIS GALLERY OPENING.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.973
WAIT, COME WITH ME!

13:26.973 --> 13:29.016
WHAT? NO, HAYLEY,
I HAVE TO GET HOME

13:29.016 --> 13:30.184
AND START MY RESEARCH.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.394
OH, COME ON,
IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.979
FIVE MINUTES.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.022
COME ON.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
BUT, BUT... NO!

13:35.022 --> 13:36.733
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME!
( GROANS )

13:40.111 --> 13:41.820
( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION )

13:48.787 --> 13:50.079
THIS IS INTERESTING...

13:51.247 --> 13:52.707
HAYLEY: LOOK AT THIS...

13:54.334 --> 13:57.128
"BROADWAY AT CHRISTMAS, 1925."

13:57.128 --> 13:59.005
THAT ACTRESS WAS PROBABLY
STARRING IN A PLAY

13:59.005 --> 14:00.465
RIGHT THEN AND THERE!

14:00.465 --> 14:01.633
HMM...

14:01.633 --> 14:03.842
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THEM
MEETING IN NEW YORK.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.886
SEE HOW MUCH MORE
YOU ALREADY KNOW?

14:07.305 --> 14:08.973
OH, LOOK AT THIS ONE!

14:12.727 --> 14:14.354
THIS ONE'S
MY FAVORITE.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.939
I ESPECIALLY DIG HOW THE LIGHT
IS CAST ON THE LOVERS' FACES,

14:16.939 --> 14:20.151
AND IT'S ALL REFLECTED
IN THE STORE WINDOW'S
CHRISTMAS DISPLAY.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.277
COFFEE SHOP GUY?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.155
NEWSPAPER GIRL!

14:24.155 --> 14:25.824
WAIT, YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

14:25.824 --> 14:26.949
NO, NOT REALLY.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.284
WELL, WE CROSSED SWORDS
THE OTHER DAY

14:28.284 --> 14:29.786
AT THE BREWING STATION

14:29.786 --> 14:31.788
'CAUSE I LIKE
"DECK THE HALLS,"
AND SHE DOES NOT.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.125
UH, BRADY HOWE,
ASSISTANT GALLERY MANAGER

14:36.125 --> 14:37.836
AND ARTIST IN RESIDENCE.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.462
MM...

14:39.462 --> 14:41.214
OH, YIKES, I'M SORRY.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.760
YEP.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.638
HI. I'M HAYLEY.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.930
HI.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.641
TELL THE NICE MAN
YOUR NAME, SWEETIE.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.768
OH, SUSAN.
SUSAN NICHOLAS. HELLO.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.356
SO, "ARTIST IN RESIDENCE."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.816
UH, BASICALLY MEANS

14:59.816 --> 15:01.942
THAT THE GALLERY OWNERS
LET ME USE THEIR STOREROOM

15:01.942 --> 15:03.319
TO WORK ON MY MASTERPIECES...

15:03.319 --> 15:05.613
THAT IS,
WHEN I'M NOT HOSTING
GALLERY OPENINGS

15:05.613 --> 15:08.115
AND GIVING MY TWO CENTS
ABOUT WHAT'S HANGING
ON THE WALLS.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.368
YOUR "MASTERPIECES"?

15:10.368 --> 15:11.870
WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO AIM HIGH.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.581
ANYBODY WANT A GUIDED TOUR?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.541
OH, YEAH,
IT'S JUST SO LATE.
I FEEL LIKE...

15:16.541 --> 15:18.501
WE'D LOVE ONE.
UH, YES.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.169
AWESOME.
FOLLOW ME.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.755
GREAT, GREAT.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.553
AND THIS ONE'S IS CALLED

15:28.553 --> 15:30.805
"CHRISTMAS AT
THE WHITE HOUSE, 1955..."

15:30.805 --> 15:34.768
EVEN THOUGH IT'S
REALLY JUST A WHITE HOUSE
IN OHIO SOMEWHERE,

15:34.768 --> 15:36.436
BUT WHAT'S COOL ABOUT IT

15:36.436 --> 15:37.937
IS THE WAY THAT THE LIGHT
LANDS IN A WAY--

15:37.937 --> 15:39.647
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S DAYTIME ABOVE
THE HOUSE,

15:39.647 --> 15:40.732
BUT NIGHT TIME BELOW.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.775
EXACTLY.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.151
UH, HAYLEY,
WE REALLY HAVE TO GO.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.863
BUT BRADY'S NOT DONE YET.
ARE YOU, BRADY?

15:46.863 --> 15:49.156
HONESTLY, I COULD TALK
ABOUT THIS STUFF FOR DAYS,

15:49.156 --> 15:51.117
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GET OUT OF HERE WHILE
YOU HAVE THE CHANCE.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.077
OKAY, WELL,
THANK YOU FOR THE TOUR.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.121
YOU ARE A WEALTH
OF INFORMATION.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.497
IT WAS A PLEASURE.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.957
UM...

15:57.957 --> 16:00.042
THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT THING
I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.628
UH, WHAT'S THAT?

16:01.628 --> 16:04.964
WHETHER OR NOT I COULD TAKE YOU
FOR AN ADULT DRINK SOMETIME.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.925
WH...
MARTINI?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.384
WINE?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.094
EGGNOG IF YOU'RE
INTO THE WHOLE
SEASONAL BEVERAGE THING?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.178
( LAUGHS NERVOUSLY )

16:11.178 --> 16:12.639
PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME DRINK ALONE.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.516
DOES THAT LINE
REALLY WORK FOR YOU?

16:15.516 --> 16:16.935
DON'T KNOW. DOES IT?

16:16.935 --> 16:19.520
MM... NOT SO MUCH.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.773
PITY.
I'M EXCELLENT COMPANY.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
( LAUGHS )

16:26.986 --> 16:28.112
TAXI!

16:29.739 --> 16:32.241
ARE YOU INSANE?
HE WAS ADORABLE!

16:32.241 --> 16:34.118
I DON'T TRUST ARTSY TYPES.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.536
I'M AN ARTSY TYPE.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.663
ARE WE DATING?

16:36.663 --> 16:37.872
YOU'RE NOT DATING ANYONE!

16:37.872 --> 16:39.582
THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH

16:39.582 --> 16:41.542
THAT COULD MAKE ME
CONSIDER THAT IDEA.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.669
BRADY: HEY, HEY!

16:44.462 --> 16:45.964
SORRY FOR INVADING
YOUR UMBRELLA SPACE.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.548
YOU FORGOT THIS
IN THE COAT ROOM.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.592
OH... UH, THANK YOU.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.345
NO PROBLEM.
NICE MEETING YOU.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.016
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
ON EARTH, HUH?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.984
SHE'S COMING.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.318
OH! COMING!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.534
I SEE SOMEONE'S GETTING
HER CAFFEINE FIX.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.702
HI, DEREK.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.036
YEAH, 3:00 ROLLS AROUND,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.539
AND IT'S EITHER THIS
OR A POWER NAP...

17:19.539 --> 17:20.999
AND SINCE
NO ONE EVER GOT A RAISE

17:20.999 --> 17:22.917
BY DOZING IN THEIR CUBICLE...

17:22.917 --> 17:24.711
SAY NO MORE.
I'M WITH YOU.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.714
HOW'S YOUR
CHRISTMAS STORY GOING?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.549
YOU ALL SWEPT UP
IN THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.842
( LAUGHS )

17:30.842 --> 17:33.386
NOT SURE "SWEPT UP"
WOULD EXACTLY DESCRIBE IT.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.222
ANYWAY, I'M STILL
IN RESEARCH MODE.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.850
HOW ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU A HOLIDAY
KIND OF A GUY?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.226
CAN I BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.602
MM-HMM.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.479
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR'S.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.856
REALLY?

17:44.856 --> 17:47.942
IT ALL FEELS SO FORCED
AND MANUFACTURED.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.736
I MOSTLY CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE WEEK TO PASS

17:49.736 --> 17:52.739
SO I CAN GET
BACK ON SCHEDULE
AND BACK TO WORK...

17:52.739 --> 17:54.407
AND I KNOW
IT'S EARLY DECEMBER,

17:54.407 --> 17:56.659
BUT IF I HAVE TO HEAR
"DECK THE HALLS"
ONE MORE TIME,

17:56.659 --> 17:58.953
I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY ACTIONS.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.247
A MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.835
I MEAN...

18:05.835 --> 18:07.628
I FEEL YOUR PAIN.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.589
HEY, ENJOY YOUR COFFEE!

18:13.009 --> 18:14.134
UGH...

18:39.702 --> 18:40.787
HEY THERE!

18:40.787 --> 18:43.414
WHAT? WHAT?
HI, BRADY! HI.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.791
SUSAN NICHOLAS.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.917
LEAVING SO SOON?

18:45.917 --> 18:47.209
WHAT? NO, NO, NO.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.502
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE YOU HERE.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.837
I WAS JUST WALKING...

18:51.547 --> 18:53.215
THAT IS A LOVELY ANGEL.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.220
CAREFUL, SHE SEES ALL
AND KNOWS ALL.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.513
IF YOU BELIEVE IN ANGELS.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.765
LET ME GUESS, YOU DON'T.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.516
LET ME GUESS...
YOU DO.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.811
WELL, IN ART,
ANGELS ARE EVERYWHERE,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.270
SO IT'S HARD NOT TO.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.566
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
OTHER THAN WINDOW WATCHING?

19:10.566 --> 19:13.486
ACTUALLY, I WAS ABOUT
TO POP IN SOMEWHERE WARM.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.779
YOU UP FOR THAT DRINK?

19:14.779 --> 19:17.448
OH, NO,
I HAVE TO GET HOME.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.826
WORK TO DO FOR TOMORROW.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.535
YET HERE WE ARE...

19:21.535 --> 19:23.663
YOU, ME... AN ANGEL.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.581
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.958
COME ON, ONE DRINK.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.418
THEN YOU CAN GO BACK AND BE
THE RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEE.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.380
YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE PAINT ON YOUR NOSE.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.717
KIDDING.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.887
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT
AS A YES.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.644
( ♪♪ )

19:48.729 --> 19:50.940
IT WARMS THE COCKLES
OF ME HEART.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.191
BEST IRISH COFFEE IN THE CITY.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.030
SORRY, JUST A LITTLE
CRAZY IN HERE,

19:57.030 --> 19:58.906
AND I'VE GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.825
EVERYBODY NEEDS
TO RELAX SOMETIMES.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.452
( CHUCKLES )
THAT'S NOT A WORD
ON MY SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.663
IS IT EVER?

20:07.165 --> 20:10.250
BRADY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.170
NO, UM...

20:12.170 --> 20:13.462
I'M- I'M TRYING TO.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.048
WANT TO GIVE ME A HAND HERE?

20:16.799 --> 20:17.967
FINE...

20:17.967 --> 20:19.385
I'M KIND OF STRESSED OUT

20:19.385 --> 20:21.721
ABOUT THIS
CHRISTMAS ARTICLE I'M DOING.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.598
SO YOU'RE WRITING.
THAT'S GREAT.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.933
YOUR WISH CAME TRUE.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.267
I FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING
WITHOUT A MAP.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.187
I MEAN,
I KNOW WHERE I HAVE TO GO,

20:29.187 --> 20:32.190
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW,
OR EVEN IF I'LL GET THERE.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.110
ENJOY THE RIDE...
THE DESTINATION WILL UNFOLD.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.488
AND DID YOU JUST
MAKE THAT UP NOW,

20:39.488 --> 20:40.907
OR STEAL IT
FROM AN OLD "STAR TREK?"

20:40.907 --> 20:41.949
( LAUGHS )

20:41.949 --> 20:43.117
THAT'S FUNNY.

20:45.203 --> 20:48.247
SO, TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR ART.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.290
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.710
OH... ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.004
PORTRAITS, LANDSCAPES...

20:55.004 --> 20:56.338
ABSTRACTS.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.799
SCULPTURES, MOSAICS,
MIXED-MEDIA... YOU NAME IT.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.467
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.803
CHOICE IS ONE OF
LIFE'S GREAT LUXURIES.

21:02.803 --> 21:06.348
YOU THINK YOU'LL
CHOOSE TO RUN
YOUR OWN GALLERY ONE DAY?

21:07.474 --> 21:09.227
NO IDEA.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.604
HAVE A BUDDY, ZACK...
HE FOUND A SPACE A WHILE BACK.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.606
HE THOUGHT WE COULD GO IN
ON ONE TOGETHER...

21:13.606 --> 21:15.691
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

21:15.691 --> 21:17.985
I WANT TO CREATE.
I WANT TO STAY LIBERATED.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.486
YEAH...

21:19.486 --> 21:20.988
BUT THINK ABOUT IT...

21:20.988 --> 21:22.573
IF YOU HAD YOUR OWN GALLERY,
YOU COULD SHOW YOUR WORK

21:22.573 --> 21:24.992
WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE'S
PERMISSION.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.577
THAT'S LIBERATION.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.541
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

21:32.541 --> 21:33.626
IT'S NOT BAD.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.752
( LAUGHS )

21:35.962 --> 21:38.589
WELL, IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT
WITH YOUR ARTICLE,

21:38.589 --> 21:40.382
AT LEAST YOU HAVE CHRISTMAS
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.843
MM...

21:42.843 --> 21:44.511
OKAY.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.722
LET'S JUST SAY I HAVE
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP

21:46.722 --> 21:48.224
WITH CHRISTMAS.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.558
HAVE YOU SEEN
A COUPLES' COUNSELOR?

21:49.558 --> 21:50.643
I TRIED.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.228
SANTA KEPT MISSING
THE APPOINTMENT.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.730
SOMETHING ABOUT
HIS "BUSY SEASON?"
I DON'T KNOW.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.650
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE A LITTLE...

34:28.650 --> 34:31.820
BUT SINCE THE TIE INCIDENT,
I'M NOT SO SURE.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.031
WELL...

34:34.031 --> 34:35.532
ANGELS SEE ALL
AND KNOW ALL.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.577
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT BRADY SAID.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.495
( CHUCKLES )
SMART MAN.

34:43.790 --> 34:44.917
WHO'S BRADY?

34:46.001 --> 34:48.545
HE'S THIS ARTIST I MET.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.005
REALLY?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.215
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

34:52.215 --> 34:53.967
MOM, I BARELY KNOW HIM.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.719
THAT WASN'T WHAT I ASKED.

34:57.136 --> 35:00.640
WELL, I'LL SAY THIS...
HE'S DIFFERENT.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.975
NOW, THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.268
OKAY, YOU'RE JUST
SAYING THAT

35:03.268 --> 35:05.144
BECAUSE HE'S MALE
AND BREATHING.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.312
( LAUGHS )

35:06.312 --> 35:07.856
NO.

35:07.856 --> 35:10.149
I'M SAYING IT BECAUSE
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER

35:10.149 --> 35:12.277
THAN TO SEE
MY ONLY DAUGHTER HAPPY...

35:12.277 --> 35:14.780
AND DON'T THANK ME.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.906
IT'S MY JOB.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.368
( ♪♪ )

35:57.405 --> 35:58.740
( SIGHS )

36:03.536 --> 36:07.040
SO WERE YOU SURPRISED
TO GET MY TEXT?

36:07.040 --> 36:09.250
PROBABLY NOT AS SURPRISED
AS YOU WERE THAT YOU SENT IT.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.753
OH, PLEASE,
I HAD A LITTLE WRITER'S BLOCK.

36:11.753 --> 36:14.923
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
GOOD FOR ME TO GET OUT.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.424
FAIR ENOUGH...

36:16.424 --> 36:19.136
SO, UM, HOW DID YOU REMEMBER

36:19.136 --> 36:21.220
THAT YOU USED TO MAKE
YOUR OWN CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS?

36:21.220 --> 36:22.639
WAS THAT HYPNOSIS?

36:22.639 --> 36:24.432
REGRESSION THERAPY?

36:24.432 --> 36:25.851
PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY...

36:25.851 --> 36:27.644
MY MOTHER'S.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.521
WELL, WHAT BETTER PLACE

36:29.521 --> 36:31.773
TO REVISIT YOUR GLORY DAYS
OF ORNAMENT-MAKING

36:31.773 --> 36:33.150
THAN AN ART STUDIO?

36:33.150 --> 36:35.652
ESPECIALLY ONE THAT COMES
WITH ITS VERY OWN ARTIST.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.362
AND A TALENTED ONE AT THAT.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.406
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE SO GOOD?

36:41.783 --> 36:43.242
OH...

36:43.242 --> 36:45.370
PROBABLY ALL KINDS OF THINGS
WE HAVEN'T TOLD EACH OTHER.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.249
SUSAN: WORST PART WAS...
( INHALES SHARPLY )

36:50.249 --> 36:52.335
HE LEFT ME
FOR OUR YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.339
HERE I WAS, THINKING,
"OH, IT'S SO GREAT!

36:56.339 --> 36:57.966
"STEVE AND I HAVE
SO MUCH IN COMMON.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.426
WE EVEN BOTH LOVE YOGA!"

37:00.426 --> 37:03.555
LITTLE DID I KNOW
WHAT HE LOVED WAS THE TEACHER.

37:04.681 --> 37:06.599
THAT'S A BUMMER.

37:06.599 --> 37:09.227
AT LEAST HE LEFT YOU
FOR A PERSON, THOUGH.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.436
MY LAST GIRLFRIEND, ANNA,

37:10.436 --> 37:12.271
SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD
RATHER BE ALONE

37:12.271 --> 37:13.523
THAN BE WITH ME.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.984
UGH, THAT'S AWFUL.
YOU'RE NOT THAT BAD.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.360
GEE, THANKS.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.073
I'M GUESSING
SHE DIDN'T DUMP YOU

37:21.073 --> 37:22.657
ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.784
HE DID?
YEAH.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.205
YEESH, THAT'S LOW.

37:28.205 --> 37:31.374
NO WONDER YOU'RE SO
WEIRD ABOUT CHRISTMAS.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.793
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
KIND OF FUNKY
ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS...

37:33.793 --> 37:35.962
ALL THAT PRESSURE
TO ENJOY YOURSELF...

37:35.962 --> 37:37.797
I KNOW,
IT'S SUCH A CHORE.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.426
AFTER STEVE,
IT WENT INTO OVERDRIVE.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.677
WELL...

37:42.677 --> 37:45.889
WHEN ANNA LEFT ME,
I WAS A MESS, BUT...

37:45.889 --> 37:47.348
I REALIZED...

37:48.975 --> 37:50.602
IT WASN'T REALLY HER
THAT I MISSED THAT MUCH,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.437
IT WAS JUST BEING
PART OF A COUPLE, YOU KNOW?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.856
A TEAM.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.109
SO I JUST TOLD MYSELF,
"I'M GOING TO GO OUT
AND FIND SOMEONE BETTER."

37:57.109 --> 37:59.277
WELL, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.738
ME, I JUST TURNED IN
MY YOGA MAT,

38:01.738 --> 38:03.448
CALLED IT A DAY.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.953
YOGA'S BORING, ANYWAY.
NOBODY TALKS.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.207
RULE NUMBER ONE,
NO RULERS.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.751
WHAT? WHY? I DON'T WANT
A LOPSIDED GINGERBREAD HOUSE.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.377
JUST EYEBALL THE PIECES
AND GLUE THEM TOGETHER.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.670
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE PERFECT.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.338
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HANDMADE.

38:19.338 --> 38:20.506
SEE?

38:20.506 --> 38:22.467
NO, SEE, THAT'S JUST GOOFY.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.594
( LAUGHS )
I KNOW, RIGHT?

38:27.139 --> 38:28.514
SO, UM...

38:28.514 --> 38:31.101
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID...

38:31.101 --> 38:34.062
ABOUT RUNNING
MY OWN GALLERY.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.732
IT KIND OF
MAKES SENSE.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.610
AND YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
THIS MIGHT QUALIFY

38:40.610 --> 38:43.071
AS AN ACTUAL LIFE PLAN?

38:43.071 --> 38:44.156
NOPE.

38:44.156 --> 38:47.492
I DON'T MAKE PLANS...
I... "ENVISION."

38:47.492 --> 38:50.369
OH, WELL,
I STAND CORRECTED.

38:50.369 --> 38:51.746
MISS NEAT,

38:51.746 --> 38:53.414
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SPOT
OF PAINT ON YOUR FACE THERE.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.749
WHERE? HERE?
JUST...

38:54.749 --> 38:56.168
HERE?

38:56.168 --> 38:57.877
THERE. HERE.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.758
THERE YOU GO.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.262
GOOD AS NEW.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.514
THANKS.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.079
( LAUGHS )

39:34.206 --> 39:36.249
MM!

39:36.249 --> 39:38.251
WHO ARE THOSE FROM?
OH...

39:39.878 --> 39:42.755
"SORRY I SNAPPED.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME. DEREK."

39:42.755 --> 39:44.299
NICE MOVE.
POINT, DEREK.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.220
I SAW BRADY AGAIN
YESTERDAY.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.428
POINT, BRADY!

39:49.428 --> 39:50.722
AND?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.848
AND NOTHING.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.683
WE MADE CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS...

39:53.683 --> 39:55.101
AND...

39:55.101 --> 39:56.686
AND...

39:56.686 --> 39:58.688
HE AND HIS
FAVORITE BOTTLE OF WINE
ARE COMING OVER LATER.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.606
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.984
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW.
YOU'RE JUST HANGING OUT.
THIS IS GOOD.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.361
IT IS?

40:04.361 --> 40:06.905
BECAUSE IT'S FEELING
A LITTLE WHIRLWIND TO ME.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.031
YEAH?

40:08.031 --> 40:09.199
LUCKY YOU.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.372
( CELL PHONE RINGS )

40:17.874 --> 40:19.417
GRANDPA?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

40:20.668 --> 40:22.295
SPRING CLEANING?
IN DECEMBER?

40:23.963 --> 40:28.260
I FIGURED YOUR GRANDMA'S
BEEN GONE THREE YEARS NOW.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.428
SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED ME
TO DOWNSIZE A BIT.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.058
MUST SAY, IT WAS QUITE
THE TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.517
WHA... GRANDPA!

40:36.517 --> 40:39.354
HOW IN THE WORLD
DID YOU DO THIS?

40:39.354 --> 40:41.356
WELL, THE NEIGHBOR KID
NEEDED SOME CHRISTMAS MONEY,

40:41.356 --> 40:42.732
SO I HIRED HIM AS MY ASSISTANT.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.526
DON'T TELL ANYONE,
BUT HE DID MOST OF THE WORK!

40:45.526 --> 40:46.861
( LAUGHS )

40:46.861 --> 40:49.114
I FOUND THIS BOX
STUCK IN A CORNER.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.617
IT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF OLD LEDGERS, INVOICES...

40:52.617 --> 40:53.826
BUT...

40:54.827 --> 40:56.288
THERE WAS ALSO THIS.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.044
A BLUEPRINT?

41:03.044 --> 41:04.337
YEAH.

41:04.337 --> 41:05.588
OF WHAT?

41:05.588 --> 41:08.091
AS SOON AS I SAW IT,
I REMEMBERED

41:08.091 --> 41:10.551
A WHOLE OTHER PART
OF THAT STORY
MY FATHER TOLD ME.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.263
WANT TO HEAR?

41:13.263 --> 41:15.473
YES, I WANT TO HEAR!
( LAUGHS )

41:17.058 --> 41:18.351
WELL...

41:18.351 --> 41:20.353
THAT FIRST CHRISTMAS WEEK
IN NEW YORK,

41:20.353 --> 41:23.315
BEFORE MY DAD WENT BACK HOME,
HE CAME UP WITH A PLAN...

41:25.524 --> 41:27.110
NEXT CHRISTMAS,

41:27.110 --> 41:29.528
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK
TO NEW YORK...

41:29.528 --> 41:32.740
AND BRING YOU HOME WITH ME,
TO BETHLEHEM.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.285
OWEN, THAT'S A
WHOLE YEAR AWAY...

41:36.869 --> 41:38.997
AND WHAT EXACTLY
WILL YOU BE DOING
ALL THAT TIME?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.457
BUILDING A CABIN FOR US...

41:40.457 --> 41:43.751
WITH A CHRISTMAS TREE
OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR,

41:46.171 --> 41:47.797
OWEN...

41:47.797 --> 41:49.341
THAT SOUNDS SO BEAUTIFUL...

41:51.550 --> 41:54.012
AND I'M SO FLATTERED,
REALLY AND TRULY...

41:55.388 --> 41:57.432
BUT...

41:57.432 --> 42:00.726
MY LIFE IS HERE,
IN NEW YORK.

42:00.726 --> 42:04.605
MAYBE SO, AND I KNOW
YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO...

42:05.898 --> 42:07.400
BUT NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME...

42:08.567 --> 42:10.403
I'M HOPING YOU'LL SAY YES.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.074
AND THIS WAS HIS DESIGN
FOR THE COTTAGE?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.617
DREW IT HIMSELF.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.244
SEE HIS INITIALS
HERE IN THE CORNER?

42:18.244 --> 42:20.538
YEAH.
DID HE EVER BUILD IT?

42:21.622 --> 42:24.083
WELL, IF HE DID,
I NEVER SAW IT.

42:25.251 --> 42:26.503
OH!

42:28.171 --> 42:29.464
I FOUND SOMETHING ELSE...

42:32.884 --> 42:35.220
MY PARENTS' WEDDING PICTURE.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.013
WHAT A LOVELY COUPLE.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.723
YOUR MOTHER WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.807
YEAH.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.810
"AS BEAUTIFUL
INSIDE AS OUT."

42:42.810 --> 42:44.354
THAT'S WHAT MY DAD USED TO SAY.

42:44.354 --> 42:46.814
SHE'D HAVE TO BE
TO ACCEPT THAT ANGEL HE CARVED

42:46.814 --> 42:48.358
WITH HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND'S EYES!

42:48.358 --> 42:49.692
( LAUGHING )

42:49.692 --> 42:51.694
IN FACT, IT WAS
BECAUSE OF MY MOM

42:51.694 --> 42:52.987
THAT HE EVEN KEPT THE ANGEL.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.364
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

42:54.364 --> 42:57.742
WELL, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

42:57.742 --> 42:59.785
IT WAS ON THE DAY
THEY FIRST MET,

42:59.785 --> 43:02.163
AT THEIR CHURCH,
BACK IN BETHLEHEM...

43:04.123 --> 43:05.250
EXCUSE ME?

43:06.584 --> 43:07.835
HELLO!

43:07.835 --> 43:08.961
CAN I HELP YOU?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.629
IS PASTOR BOYD HERE?

43:10.629 --> 43:11.964
NO...

43:11.964 --> 43:14.175
I'M MAGGIE,
THE NEW CHURCH SECRETARY.

43:14.175 --> 43:16.135
WELL, UM,

43:16.135 --> 43:19.597
MAGGIE, I'D LIKE
TO GIVE THIS ANGEL
TO THE CHURCH,

43:19.597 --> 43:21.349
FOR THEIR CHRISTMAS TREE.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.935
IT'S TOP QUALITY,
HANDMADE.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.895
LET ME GUESS... BY YOU?

43:25.895 --> 43:27.730
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

43:27.730 --> 43:29.899
THE WAY YOU'RE HOLDING HER.

43:29.899 --> 43:31.150
SO PROUD...

43:31.150 --> 43:32.569
LIKE SHE'S A PART OF YOU.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.988
WELL, SHE WAS, BUT...

43:35.988 --> 43:37.282
NOT ANYMORE.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.867
WOULD YOU LIKE HER?

43:39.867 --> 43:41.327
IT'S VERY GENEROUS,

43:41.327 --> 43:43.746
AND I'M SURE PASTOR BOYD
WOULD BE GRATEFUL...

43:43.746 --> 43:46.499
BUT JUST BETWEEN US...

43:46.499 --> 43:49.627
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO GIVE AWAY
SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL?

43:49.627 --> 43:51.629
YOU SHOULD KEEP HER.
SHE'LL BRING YOU LUCK.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.381
SHE ALREADY HAS...

43:53.381 --> 43:54.591
BAD LUCK.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.677
CAN I MAKE
A SUGGESTION, UM...

43:58.677 --> 44:01.139
OWEN! UH...
OWEN THOMAS.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.891
OKAY, OWEN THOMAS.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.477
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.

44:05.477 --> 44:08.229
WHY NOT KEEP THE ANGEL
UNTIL NEXT CHRISTMAS?

44:08.229 --> 44:10.064
IF SHE DOESN'T BRING YOU
BETTER LUCK,

44:10.064 --> 44:12.275
THEN YOU CAN COME BACK
AND LEAVE HER HERE WITH US.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.572
SOMETHING TELLS ME
MY LUCK IS CHANGING ALREADY.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.825
GRANDPA:
<i>AND IT SURE DID.</i>

44:20.825 --> 44:22.701
<i>SIX MONTHS LATER,</i>
<i>THEY WERE MARRIED.</i>

44:29.375 --> 44:33.045
SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THE ANGEL BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.

44:34.755 --> 44:37.467
I MEAN...
SORT OF, IN A WAY.

44:37.467 --> 44:40.928
( CHUCKLES )
HONEY, TAKE IT
FROM YOUR OLD GRANDPA...

44:40.928 --> 44:43.473
IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE,
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LEAP...

44:45.183 --> 44:46.767
BUT LOOK TOO CLOSE,

44:47.852 --> 44:49.521
AND THE MAGIC'S GONE...

44:51.189 --> 44:53.858
AND, REALLY,
WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?

45:00.281 --> 45:02.950
BLUEPRINT ASIDE,
IT'S JUST RANDOM STUFF.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.619
NO CLUES
ABOUT THE ACTRESS...

45:04.619 --> 45:06.954
UNLESS THIS CARBURETOR
RECEIPT FROM 1958

45:06.954 --> 45:08.331
HAS SOME HIDDEN MEANING!

45:10.791 --> 45:12.210
WELL, LOOKEE HERE...

45:12.210 --> 45:14.837
BABY SUSIE WITH
GREAT-GRANDPA OWEN.

45:14.837 --> 45:16.255
( BOTH LAUGH )

45:16.255 --> 45:17.840
YOU WERE ADORABLE...

45:17.840 --> 45:19.050
OF COURSE.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.219
HE DIED
WHEN I WAS TWO.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.054
I JUST WISH
I COULD'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.681
YEAH, HE COULD'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE ACTRESS FIRST HAND,

45:24.681 --> 45:26.683
SAVED YOU
ALL THE RESEARCH.

45:26.683 --> 45:28.685
RIGHT NOW, I'D JUST SETTLE
FOR KNOWING HER NAME.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.187
I USED TO HAVE
AN OLD RELATIVE

45:31.187 --> 45:33.147
THAT ACTED
IN THE THEATER, TOO...

45:33.147 --> 45:34.691
ACCORDING TO
MY PARENTS, ANYWAY.

45:34.691 --> 45:36.108
YEAH?

45:36.108 --> 45:38.027
I THINK EVERY FAMILY HAS
AT LEAST ONE STARRY-EYED MEMBER

45:38.027 --> 45:40.154
WHO TRIED ACTING AT SOME POINT.

45:41.614 --> 45:42.739
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

45:44.659 --> 45:48.246
SUSAN: "OPENING NIGHT CROWD
ENJOYS THE CHRISTMAS SURPRISE."

45:48.246 --> 45:49.788
DECEMBER 3RD, 1926.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.249
HIS SECOND CHRISTMAS
IN NEW YORK.

45:51.249 --> 45:52.584
WAIT, IS THAT...?

45:53.876 --> 45:55.461
I THINK THAT'S
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER.

45:56.588 --> 45:58.005
WELL, AT LEAST
WE KNOW HE WAS THERE.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.507
( LAUGHS )

45:59.507 --> 46:01.593
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
THE NAME OF THE ACTRESS
HE FELL FOR.

46:02.635 --> 46:05.054
GOOGLE THE TITLE,
SEE WHAT COMES UP.

46:09.350 --> 46:11.894
"THE CHRISTMAS SURPRISE."

46:13.396 --> 46:14.939
PREMIERED ON BROADWAY, 1926

46:14.939 --> 46:17.358
AT THE ORPHEUM THEATER
IN MANHATTAN.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.736
THAT'S ALL IT SAYS.

46:19.736 --> 46:21.070
IT'S A DEAD END.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.321
NOT NECESSARILY.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.780
THAT THEATER'S STILL THERE.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.116
MIGHT BE WORTH A VISIT.

46:26.576 --> 46:27.702
BRADY!
( LAUGHS )

46:27.702 --> 46:29.120
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

46:31.830 --> 46:33.958
I MEAN,
THANK YOU.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.084
ANY TIME.

46:47.179 --> 46:49.265
GUIDE:
THEY'RE ALL AUSTRIAN CRYSTAL.

46:49.265 --> 46:51.225
SUSAN:
WOW, IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.102
GUIDE: IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST
THEATERS ON THE BROADWAY.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.437
SUSAN: REALLY?

46:54.437 --> 46:56.522
NOW, AS I TOLD YOU
ON THE PHONE, MISS NICHOLAS,

46:56.522 --> 46:59.024
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR HISTORY
HERE AT THE ORPHEUM THEATER.

46:59.024 --> 47:00.526
SO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME?

47:00.526 --> 47:01.653
I KNOW I CAN.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.241
IF WE'RE GOING
TO FIND ANYTHING,

47:07.241 --> 47:09.076
IT WILL BE IN THIS.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.620
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED HERE AT THE THEATER?

47:10.620 --> 47:11.996
ALL MY LIFE.

47:11.996 --> 47:13.122
REALLY?

47:13.122 --> 47:15.708
YES. I STARTED
AS AN ACTOR, YOU KNOW?

47:15.708 --> 47:17.042
NOW, HERE WE GO.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.670
1926.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.045
GREAT.

47:20.045 --> 47:22.214
THIS IS OCTOBER...

47:24.175 --> 47:25.426
NOVEMBER...

47:25.426 --> 47:26.552
OH, DECEMBER!

47:29.096 --> 47:30.348
LET'S SEE
WHAT'S IN HERE.

47:30.348 --> 47:31.516
WAIT, THERE.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.810
OH.
AH.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.895
"THE CHRISTMAS SURPRISE."

47:39.607 --> 47:41.025
WELL...

47:41.025 --> 47:43.277
NO WONDER MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
WAS CRAZY ABOUT HER.

47:44.737 --> 47:46.322
SHE WAS A BEAUTY.

47:46.322 --> 47:48.199
"JESSICA ROSE.

47:48.199 --> 47:50.576
THE GIRL WITH
THE LAVENDER EYES."

47:54.205 --> 47:56.248
HAYLEY: "DID 'THE GIRL
WITH THE LAVENDER EYES'

47:56.248 --> 47:57.792
"EVER TRULY CONSIDER A LIFE

47:57.792 --> 47:59.544
"WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA
COAL MINER?

47:59.544 --> 48:02.087
"DID SHE EVER REALLY SEE BEYOND
THE LIGHTS OF BROADWAY

48:02.087 --> 48:05.424
"TO PONDER A FUTURE
WITH SOMEONE AS KIND
AND LOVING AND TRUE

48:05.424 --> 48:07.176
AS HER UNEXPECTED ADMIRER?"

48:08.344 --> 48:10.346
READERS ARE GOING
TO EAT THIS UP.

48:10.346 --> 48:13.516
IT'S SO EMOTIONAL,
SO ROMANTIC.

48:13.516 --> 48:15.393
YET WITH
A ZIPPY YULETIDE TWIST!

48:15.393 --> 48:16.728
OH, AND GET THIS--

48:16.728 --> 48:18.020
THE ANGEL'S EYES?

48:18.020 --> 48:19.230
LAVENDER.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.315
JUST LIKE JESSICA'S.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.734
SWEET, OR CREEPY?

48:22.734 --> 48:25.319
TOTALLY SWEET.

48:25.319 --> 48:29.198
MEANWHILE, HOW'S "THE BOY
WITH THE HOT HAZEL EYES"?

48:29.198 --> 48:31.283
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT COLOR BRADY'S EYES WERE?

48:32.869 --> 48:34.119
ACTUALLY, THEY--

48:34.119 --> 48:35.954
THEY HAVE THESE
LITTLE GOLD FLECKS IN THEM.

48:35.954 --> 48:38.290
HOW CLOSE TO THEM DID WE GET?

48:38.290 --> 48:39.333
WHAT?

48:39.333 --> 48:40.710
I NEED A REFILL.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.882
IS ALL FORGIVEN,
OR AM I STILL AN IDIOT?

48:45.882 --> 48:49.176
FORGIVEN,
AT LEAST BY ME.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.553
I CAN'T VOUCH FOR HER.

48:52.221 --> 48:53.598
PUT IN A GOOD WORD
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

48:53.598 --> 48:54.640
JUST IN CASE.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.932
WILL DO.

48:55.932 --> 48:57.560
THANK YOU, BY THE WAY,

48:57.560 --> 48:59.645
FOR THOSE FLOWERS.
THEY'RE GORGEOUS.

49:00.897 --> 49:02.440
MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

49:08.905 --> 49:10.281
WHAT WAS THAT?

49:10.281 --> 49:11.323
WHAT? WHAT WAS WHAT?

49:11.323 --> 49:12.784
YOU TELL ME, FLIRTY McFLIRT.

49:12.784 --> 49:14.493
WHAT ABOUT BRADY
AND HIS GOLD FLECKS?

49:16.036 --> 49:17.789
BRADY AND I
ARE JUST HANGING OUT.

49:17.789 --> 49:19.206
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

49:19.206 --> 49:22.376
WHICH MAKES DEREK, WHAT,
SOME HANDY DIVERSIONARY TACTIC?

49:22.376 --> 49:23.628
NOW, SEE, THERE'S GOES

49:23.628 --> 49:26.380
THAT VIVID
IMAGINATION OF YOURS AGAIN.

49:31.968 --> 49:34.138
BRADY: NOW, CHOOSING
A CHRISTMAS TREE

49:34.138 --> 49:36.098
IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT DECISIONS
OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

49:36.098 --> 49:38.559
( CHUCKLING )

49:38.559 --> 49:42.104
SO, WHICH TREE
HAS YOUR NAME ON IT?

49:42.104 --> 49:44.649
WHICH ONE DOESN'T?

49:44.649 --> 49:46.317
ALTHOUGH
I DO HAVE TO GO SMALL.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.944
YOU KNOW, APARTMENT LIVING.

49:47.944 --> 49:51.530
WELL, IF I WAS GETTING A TREE,
IT'D BE THAT ONE,

49:51.530 --> 49:53.908
AND I'D PUT MY GREAT-GRANDPA'S
ANGEL RIGHT ON TOP.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.618
OH, YEAH?

49:55.618 --> 49:58.871
YOUR ANGEL MIGHT FIND
A HOME THIS CHRISTMAS.
NO, NO.

49:58.871 --> 50:02.416
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
THAT LITTLE CHARLIE BROWN
TREE, ARE YOU?

50:02.416 --> 50:03.668
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING

50:03.668 --> 50:04.710
IT WOULD LOOK AWESOME

50:04.710 --> 50:06.002
ON THE TREE OUTSIDE
OUR COUNTRY HOUSE.

50:06.002 --> 50:09.131
YOU HAVE
A COUNTRY HOUSE?

50:09.131 --> 50:10.800
LA-DI-DA.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.301
RELAX, IT'S MY PARENTS'.

50:12.301 --> 50:14.804
AND IT'S MORE OF A CABIN.

50:14.804 --> 50:17.932
MY GREAT-GRANDPARENTS BOUGHT IT
AGES AGO AS A VACATION PLACE.

50:17.932 --> 50:19.517
SOUNDS NICE. IS IT?

50:19.517 --> 50:21.435
IT'S TOTALLY NICE.

50:22.436 --> 50:23.771
JUST A FEW HOURS
WEST OF HERE,

50:23.771 --> 50:25.898
MURPHYSBURG,
PENNSYLVANIA.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.817
WE SHOULD GO!
CHRISTMAS EVE.

50:27.817 --> 50:29.318
WHAT? NO.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.738
MY ARTICLE'S DUE THAT DAY.

50:32.738 --> 50:33.990
AND ANYWAY,

50:33.990 --> 50:36.158
I'M NOT GOING AWAY WITH YOU.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.743
I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR ALL OF, WHAT, TWO WEEKS?

50:37.743 --> 50:40.287
WELL, BY THEN,
IT WILL HAVE BEEN 23 DAYS,

50:40.287 --> 50:42.581
WHICH IS THE LIFE SPAN
OF A WORKER BEE.

50:42.581 --> 50:43.833
OH, WOW.

50:43.833 --> 50:45.584
THANK YOU
FOR THAT LITTLE FACTOID,

50:45.584 --> 50:46.752
AND FOR THE OFFER,

50:46.752 --> 50:49.630
BUT I WILL PASS.

50:49.630 --> 50:53.217
OKAY. GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE
CLOSER TO HOME.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.305
THINK THIS'LL FIT
IN THE BACK OF AN UBER?

50:58.305 --> 51:00.307
I THINK IT COULD FIT
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.643
THAT'S VERY FUNNY
FOR SOMEONE WHO MANAGED

51:02.643 --> 51:03.853
TO GET OUT OF THERE
CHRISTMAS-TREE-LESS.

51:03.853 --> 51:05.187
UH, HELLO...

51:05.187 --> 51:06.522
THESE BAGS WEREN'T GOING
TO CARRY THEMSELVES!

51:06.522 --> 51:07.606
DEREK: SUSAN?

51:07.606 --> 51:08.774
OH!

51:08.774 --> 51:10.359
HI!
HEY.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.443
DEREK!

51:11.443 --> 51:12.820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

51:12.820 --> 51:15.280
I JUST MADE AN OFFER
ON A CONDO AROUND THE CORNER.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.908
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

51:16.908 --> 51:19.368
YOU TWO LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
SOME SHOPPING YOURSELVES.

51:19.368 --> 51:20.953
YEAH...

51:20.953 --> 51:23.873
BRADY, THIS IS DEREK.
WE WORK TOGETHER.

51:23.873 --> 51:27.083
DEREK, MEET BRADY. WE...

51:27.083 --> 51:28.377
WHAT DO WE DO?

51:28.377 --> 51:30.337
WE ANNOY EACH OTHER.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.048
IT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY ENTERTAINING.

51:33.925 --> 51:35.467
THAT'S QUITE
THE FASHION STATEMENT.

51:35.467 --> 51:36.844
OH...

51:36.844 --> 51:38.721
YEAH, IT'S ALL PART OF
"OPERATION JUMP START."

51:38.721 --> 51:39.972
WHICH IS...

51:39.972 --> 51:42.182
BRADY'S PERSONAL MISSION

51:42.182 --> 51:44.393
TO REVIVE
MY CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

51:46.102 --> 51:47.646
THAT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?

51:47.646 --> 51:49.982
NO, IT'S AS REAL AS
THE SANTAS ON THAT SCARF.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.442
IT'S... COMPLICATED.

51:51.442 --> 51:52.860
I'M SURE IT IS.

51:52.860 --> 51:54.528
NOT REALLY.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.284
HEY, GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR CONDO.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.912
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE OFFICE, OKAY?

52:02.912 --> 52:04.038
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

52:09.460 --> 52:12.004
WOW. SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

52:12.004 --> 52:13.505
OF WHO?

52:14.966 --> 52:19.011
THE MALE MODEL-LOOKING,
CONDO-BUYING OFFICE GUY

52:19.011 --> 52:22.014
THAT HAS ZERO APPRECIATION
FOR CHRISTMAS WEAR.

52:22.014 --> 52:24.475
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
THAT DEPENDS.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.979
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE?

52:27.979 --> 52:30.898
ASIDE FROM TWO PEOPLE
WHO ANNOY EACH OTHER?

52:32.108 --> 52:33.985
MORE THAN THAT, I HOPE.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.655
DON'T YOU?

52:41.492 --> 52:44.328
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE HAS NO APPRECIATION

52:44.328 --> 52:47.581
FOR CHRISTMAS WEAR.
WHATSOEVER.
( LAUGHS )

52:54.254 --> 52:56.214
SUSAN: HEY, SO
WHY ARE WE
ON YOUR ROOF?

52:59.677 --> 53:01.679
BRADY: OKAY, WE HAVE
THIS WEIRD TRADITION

53:01.679 --> 53:03.097
IN MY FAMILY.

53:04.682 --> 53:07.893
WE ONLY PUT UP
OUR CHRISTMAS TREES OUTSIDE.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.897
THE IDEA IS
THAT IT HELPS THEM--

53:11.897 --> 53:13.398
LOOK UP TO GOD.

53:15.484 --> 53:19.071
BRADY, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.866
MY FAMILY HAS
THE SAME TRADITION.

53:23.534 --> 53:24.952
COME ON. NO WAY!

53:24.952 --> 53:26.453
THAT'S CRAZY.

53:26.453 --> 53:27.788
NO, WE'VE DONE IT FOREVER!

53:27.788 --> 53:29.790
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS AN OLD WELSH CUSTOM.

53:29.790 --> 53:31.333
WELL, APPARENTLY,

53:31.333 --> 53:33.460
A FEW IRISHMEN
PICKED IT UP ALONG THE WAY.

53:35.796 --> 53:37.006
ANYWAY...

53:38.423 --> 53:40.467
THAT'S WHY THE SMALL TREE.

53:40.467 --> 53:42.344
BECAUSE ANYTHING BIGGER
WOULD BLOW OVER UP HERE.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.389
MAKE SENSE?

53:45.389 --> 53:48.600
ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE
AS ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

54:35.564 --> 54:39.151
HE ARRIVED IN TIME

54:39.151 --> 54:41.319
TO ATTEND THE OPENING NIGHT

54:41.319 --> 54:46.533
OF A NEW PLAY CALLED
"THE CHRISTMAS SURPRISE."

54:56.252 --> 54:57.628
( KNOCKING ON DOOR )

55:00.005 --> 55:03.259
OWEN, YOU MADE IT,
AND JUST IN TIME!

55:03.259 --> 55:04.676
CURTAIN IS IN 20 MINUTES.

55:06.511 --> 55:08.931
YOU MADE THIS YOURSELF?
FOR ME?

55:10.015 --> 55:11.391
IT'S GORGEOUS.

55:11.391 --> 55:12.810
AND THE EYES...

55:12.810 --> 55:14.645
THEY'RE LAVENDER, LIKE MINE.

55:14.645 --> 55:17.815
YOU WERE ALL I COULD SEE
WHILE I WAS CARVING IT.

55:17.815 --> 55:21.652
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHRISTMAS TREE IN HERE?
I'M SURPRISED.

55:21.652 --> 55:24.696
SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME
THAT THE ONLY PLACE
FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE

55:24.696 --> 55:26.698
IS OUTSIDE, WHERE...

55:26.698 --> 55:28.075
WHERE IT CAN LOOK UP TO GOD.

55:29.701 --> 55:31.036
WELL, MARRY ME,

55:31.036 --> 55:32.537
AND EVERY YEAR,

55:32.537 --> 55:34.873
THE ANGEL WILL CROWN THE TREE
IN FRONT OF OUR NEW HOUSE.

55:38.710 --> 55:41.255
( KNOCKING )
MAN: TEN MINUTES, MISS ROSE.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.798
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DECIDE NOW.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.716
GO. HAVE A MAGNIFICENT
OPENING NIGHT.

55:44.716 --> 55:46.677
WE'LL TALK AFTER.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.637
SO WHO WAS YOUR FRIEND?

55:48.637 --> 55:50.014
DEREK.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.389
YOU SCARED ME.
SORRY.

55:51.389 --> 55:53.349
I WAS SAYING,
WHO WAS YOUR FRIEND?

55:53.349 --> 55:55.019
FROM YESTERDAY?

55:55.019 --> 55:57.188
OH, BRADY?

55:57.188 --> 55:58.981
HE'S AN ARTIST...

56:00.191 --> 56:01.692
AND A HOLIDAY ENTHUSIAST.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.485
AND...

56:03.485 --> 56:05.654
AND WHAT?

56:07.072 --> 56:08.573
SUSAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON A DEADLINE?

56:08.573 --> 56:10.159
I WAS. I AM.

56:10.159 --> 56:13.037
BUT DATING'S NOT QUITE AS OUT
OF THE QUESTION AS YOU THOUGHT?

56:13.037 --> 56:15.289
BRADY AND I
AREN'T EXACTLY DATING.

56:15.289 --> 56:16.540
GOOD.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.709
THEN YOU AND I CAN REVISIT
THE IDEA OF DINNER.

56:18.709 --> 56:20.669
OR EVEN DO
SOMETHING CHRISTMAS-Y,

56:20.669 --> 56:22.338
IF THAT HELPS
YOUR LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

56:22.338 --> 56:24.340
( EXCLAIMS )

56:28.052 --> 56:30.346
I'LL LET YOU KNOW, OKAY?

56:30.346 --> 56:32.223
FINE...

56:32.223 --> 56:34.058
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

56:34.058 --> 56:35.142
THAT...

56:35.142 --> 56:36.268
ANGEL...

56:48.739 --> 56:50.157
( IM BEEPS )

56:53.451 --> 56:55.162
WAIT, WHY WOULD YOU ORDER
A BACKUP FEATURE

56:55.162 --> 56:57.915
FROM ANOTHER WRITER
FOR MY CHRISTMAS DAY SLOT?

56:57.915 --> 56:59.166
JUST IN CASE.

56:59.166 --> 57:00.584
IN CASE OF WHAT?

57:00.584 --> 57:02.127
SUSAN, YOU'VE EDITED

57:02.127 --> 57:03.754
YOUR SHARE
OF BACKUP ARTICLES.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.005
YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

57:05.005 --> 57:06.173
YVETTE, I'VE GOT THIS.

57:06.173 --> 57:07.591
YOU DON'T NEED A BACKUP.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.134
OH, REALLY?

57:09.134 --> 57:11.303
WHAT IF YOU DON'T FIND
YOUR ENDING?

57:11.303 --> 57:12.637
THEN WHAT?

57:12.637 --> 57:13.889
WHO SAYS
I DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT?

57:13.889 --> 57:15.391
DO YOU?

57:17.393 --> 57:19.228
NOT... COMPLETELY...

57:19.228 --> 57:20.729
BUT I WILL. NO QUESTION.

57:20.729 --> 57:21.897
EXCELLENT.

57:21.897 --> 57:23.357
THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

57:26.484 --> 57:29.113
FROM NOW ON,
IT IS ALL WRITING,
ALL THE TIME!

57:29.113 --> 57:30.530
IN FACT, I'M GOING
TO CALL BRADY

57:30.530 --> 57:31.740
AND TELL HIM
I CAN'T SEE HIM TONIGHT.

57:31.740 --> 57:32.783
WE'LL HAVE TO GO
CAROLING ANOTHER TIME.

57:32.783 --> 57:33.825
NO, NO, NO!

57:33.825 --> 57:35.077
RIGHT NOW,
BEING AROUND BRADY

57:35.077 --> 57:36.661
IS THE BEST THING FOR YOU
AND YOUR ARTICLE.

57:36.661 --> 57:37.871
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

57:37.871 --> 57:39.998
SUSAN, IF YOU WANT
TO BE A GREAT WRITER,

57:39.998 --> 57:42.418
YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE LIFE,

57:42.418 --> 57:45.796
AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU
THIS HAPPY.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.257
REALLY?
YES, REALLY.

57:49.507 --> 57:51.635
YOU'VE EVEN GOT
THIS BOUNCE WHEN YOU WALK,

57:51.635 --> 57:53.053
AND YOUR SKIN,

57:53.053 --> 57:56.140
IT'S GLOWING LIKE IT WAS LIT
BY BIRTHDAY CANDLES.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.849
OKAY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.102
BRADY'S BRINGING OUT
YOUR CREATIVE SIDE.

58:03.063 --> 58:06.191
<i>♪ ...HEEDLESS OF</i>
<i>THE WIND AND WEATHER ♪</i>

58:06.191 --> 58:10.321
<i>♪ FA, LA, LA, LA, LA</i>
<i>LA, LA, LA, LA ♪</i>

58:12.448 --> 58:14.158
CHEERS, YOU GUYS.

58:14.158 --> 58:16.868
I THINK SOMEBODY'S OFFICIALLY
FOUND THEIR CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

58:16.868 --> 58:18.454
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
REALLY FUN.

58:18.454 --> 58:19.704
THANK YOU.

58:19.704 --> 58:21.623
FOR THE RECORD,
YOU CRUSHED "DECK THE HALLS."

58:21.623 --> 58:23.000
YES!

58:23.000 --> 58:24.668
AND THERE WAS NOTHING SILENT
ABOUT YOUR "SILENT NIGHT."

58:24.668 --> 58:26.920
OH, AND LET YOU SING
LOUDER THAN ME?

58:26.920 --> 58:28.546
I DON'T THINK SO, BUDDY.
( CHUCKLES )

58:29.965 --> 58:31.633
OH, WANT TO STOP FOR ONE OF

58:31.633 --> 58:33.802
THOSE "BEST IRISH COFFEES
IN ALL OF MANHATTAN"?

58:33.802 --> 58:35.804
MY TREAT.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.764
HOW ABOUT SOME PLACE
MORE PRIVATE?

58:39.391 --> 58:40.517
OKAY.

58:43.270 --> 58:44.938
TO SAINT NICK

58:44.938 --> 58:47.399
AND THE SLED
HE RODE IN ON.

58:51.153 --> 58:52.904
YOU WORKING ON SOMETHING NEW?

58:52.904 --> 58:54.656
OH, IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I'M MESSING AROUND WITH.

58:54.656 --> 58:56.367
YEAH? CAN I TAKE A LOOK?

58:56.367 --> 58:57.617
YEAH, NO...

58:57.617 --> 58:59.619
MAYBE WHEN I'M FINISHED.

59:01.079 --> 59:03.290
OKAY.

59:03.290 --> 59:04.916
SO, YOU REMEMBER
THE FRIEND OF MINE,

59:04.916 --> 59:06.168
ZACK, I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT?

59:06.168 --> 59:07.585
HE WAS LOOKING
FOR GALLERY SPACE?

59:07.585 --> 59:08.753
YEAH.

59:08.753 --> 59:09.921
WELL, HE STARTED
LOOKING AGAIN

59:09.921 --> 59:12.341
AND HE FOUND
WHAT HE THINKS
IS A PRIMO SPOT.

59:12.341 --> 59:13.925
I LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING.

59:15.135 --> 59:17.888
YEAH, HE'D PUT THE MONEY UP,
I'D RUN THE PLACE.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.890
WE'D SPLIT THE PROFITS.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.725
THAT IS FANTASTIC.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.601
WHERE IS IT?
SOHO? CHELSEA?

59:23.601 --> 59:24.936
WAIT... BROOKLYN!

59:24.936 --> 59:26.271
LOS ANGELES.

59:27.523 --> 59:28.648
LOS ANGELES?

59:28.648 --> 59:30.150
PLACE CALLED ECHO PARK.

59:30.150 --> 59:31.318
REAL HIP.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.610
PLACE NEEDS
A TON OF WORK,

59:32.610 --> 59:34.654
BUT THAT'S WHY WE CAN
DO THE LEASE.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.448
WOW, CALIFORNIA...

59:36.448 --> 59:38.867
YEAH, HONESTLY,

59:38.867 --> 59:40.327
I HAD NO IDEA
WHERE HE WAS LOOKING.

59:40.327 --> 59:41.870
I JUST ASSUMED
IT WAS NEW YORK.

59:42.954 --> 59:44.831
APPARENTLY,
THE WORST DUMP

59:44.831 --> 59:46.583
IS, LIKE, THROUGH
THE ROOF HERE, SO...

59:46.583 --> 59:47.876
BRADY...

59:49.461 --> 59:51.004
THIS IS HUGE.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.965
RUNNING A GALLERY IN L.A.!

59:53.965 --> 59:55.259
THINK ABOUT THE WORK
YOU CAN DO OUT THERE.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.386
I MEAN,
THE WEATHER ALONE

59:57.386 --> 59:58.762
SHOULD INSPIRE GREATNESS.

59:58.762 --> 1:00:00.222
CONGRATULATIONS!

1:00:00.222 --> 1:00:01.557
WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

1:00:03.183 --> 1:00:06.311
LEAVING?
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I WANT TO DO THIS THING.

1:00:06.311 --> 1:00:09.481
WELL, HOW COULD YOU NOT?
IT SOUNDS PERFECT!

1:00:09.481 --> 1:00:11.983
WHAT IF I WAS TRYING TO LEAVE
MYSELF OPEN FOR OTHER THINGS?

1:00:11.983 --> 1:00:13.735
LIKE WHAT?

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:15.820
THIS COULD BE
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.

1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:17.448
YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOW THIS.

1:00:17.448 --> 1:00:19.616
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT US,
I AGREE.

1:00:25.289 --> 1:00:26.415
BRADY...

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:29.585
YOU'RE A TALENTED ARTIST.

1:00:30.710 --> 1:00:32.129
YOUR SHOULD PUT THE WORK FIRST.

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:33.797
YOU HAVE TO PUT
YOUR WORK FIRST.

1:00:34.881 --> 1:00:36.133
AS FOR US...

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:38.469
WHO KNOWS WHAT WE ARE?

1:00:39.470 --> 1:00:41.638
LOOK, YOU'RE A WRITER.
I GET THAT.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.515
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT WORDS,
BUT...

1:00:44.516 --> 1:00:46.017
NOT EVERYTHING
HAS TO HAVE A LABEL.

1:00:47.394 --> 1:00:49.062
I THINK WE'VE STARTED
SOMETHING REALLY GOOD HERE.

1:00:50.397 --> 1:00:51.731
I THINK IT CAN
ONLY GET BETTER.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:54.318
YEAH. MAYBE,

1:00:54.318 --> 1:00:55.360
BUT I'D FEEL TERRIBLE

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:57.112
IF YOU DIDN'T MOVE
BECAUSE OF ME.

1:00:57.112 --> 1:00:59.197
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

1:01:02.618 --> 1:01:03.743
WHAT?

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:08.957
TRUTH?

1:01:08.957 --> 1:01:11.543
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TRY
AND TALK ME OUT OF THIS.

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:18.091
HOW ABOUT...

1:01:18.091 --> 1:01:21.094
WE TABLE THIS
CONVERSATION FOR NOW,

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:22.387
JUST FINISH UP OUR WORK,

1:01:22.387 --> 1:01:24.389
AND ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS?

1:01:26.266 --> 1:01:27.434
TOGETHER?

1:01:29.102 --> 1:01:30.937
YEAH. TOGETHER.

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:37.402
WELL, BRADY, WE'RE THRILLED
YOU COULD JOIN US TONIGHT.

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:39.655
WE THOUGHT
WE'D NEVER MEET YOU.

1:01:39.655 --> 1:01:40.822
MOM...

1:01:40.822 --> 1:01:42.199
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE
MY WIFE, BRADY.

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:43.950
WHEN IT COMES
TO MATTERS OF THE HEART,

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:45.327
SHE'S INCORRIGIBLE.

1:01:45.327 --> 1:01:46.911
( LAUGHS )
NO WORRIES.

1:01:46.911 --> 1:01:48.913
IT'S GOOD
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

1:01:48.913 --> 1:01:50.957
I'M STOKED TO HELP YOU
DECORATE THIS TREE.

1:01:50.957 --> 1:01:52.792
AND OUTDOORS, TOO--

1:01:52.792 --> 1:01:54.961
JUST LIKE
YOUR FOLKS DO IT, RIGHT?

1:01:54.961 --> 1:01:56.505
YEAH. THAT'S
A CRAZY COINCIDENCE, HUH?

1:01:56.505 --> 1:01:57.548
OR NOT.

1:01:57.548 --> 1:01:59.007
WHO KNOWS?

1:02:02.927 --> 1:02:04.221
BRADY, THERE'S SOME CIDER
ON THE STOVE.

1:02:04.221 --> 1:02:05.722
WOULD YOU MIND
GETTING IT FOR US?

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:07.098
YEAH, SURE.

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:08.225
THANK YOU!

1:02:11.019 --> 1:02:12.812
OH, I LOVE HIM!

1:02:12.812 --> 1:02:14.439
I LIKE HIM, TOO.

1:02:17.234 --> 1:02:18.276
HONEY...

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:19.653
WHAT'S WRONG?

1:02:19.653 --> 1:02:23.657
I TOLD BRADY WE COULD SPEND
THE HOLIDAYS TOGETHER,

1:02:23.657 --> 1:02:25.742
BUT NOW I'M THINKING
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.

1:02:26.826 --> 1:02:28.453
I DON'T WANT US
TO GET TOO CLOSE.

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:31.248
I MEAN, IF HE GOES
TO L.A., THAT'LL BE IT.

1:02:31.248 --> 1:02:33.041
SO, WHAT'S THE POINT?

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:36.044
YEAH, LOGICALLY SPEAKING,
I CAN'T DISAGREE.

1:02:36.044 --> 1:02:37.212
HONEY...

1:02:37.212 --> 1:02:39.464
IF YOU AND BRADY
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER,

1:02:39.464 --> 1:02:41.091
IT MAY ALREADY
BE OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

1:02:41.091 --> 1:02:43.218
MOM, PLEASE,
I NEED A REAL ANSWER.

1:02:43.218 --> 1:02:44.636
LOOK, WHEN THE TIME COMES--

1:02:44.636 --> 1:02:46.221
I MEAN, IF IT COMES--

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:48.765
MAKE THE DECISION TOGETHER.

1:02:50.934 --> 1:02:53.770
BRADY: OKAY!
WHO WANTS SOME CIDER?

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:56.356
I WANT SOME CIDER.
YES, SIR.

1:02:56.356 --> 1:02:58.233
THANK YOU.

1:02:58.233 --> 1:02:59.484
( CLINKING )

1:02:59.484 --> 1:03:01.445
FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.

1:03:01.445 --> 1:03:03.321
AW THIS IS SO NICE.

1:03:03.321 --> 1:03:05.115
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
HO, HO, HO!

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:17.753
DOES EATING DESSERT
ALWAYS MAKE YOU THIS HAPPY?

1:03:19.421 --> 1:03:20.631
THAT'S PART OF IT.

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:23.717
OKAY, LISTEN,

1:03:23.717 --> 1:03:25.135
I... I TOLD ZACK
I'M OUT OF THE L.A. DEAL.

1:03:25.135 --> 1:03:27.429
IF HE WANTS TO DO IT,
HE'S ON HIS OWN.

1:03:29.306 --> 1:03:31.141
BRADY, THAT'S CRAZY.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:33.518
I TOLD YOU,
YOU CAN'T NOT GO
BECAUSE OF ME.

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:36.313
NO, YOU SAID

1:03:36.313 --> 1:03:38.189
THAT YOU'D FEEL TERRIBLE
IF I DIDN'T GO BECAUSE OF YOU,

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:40.984
BUT THEN I REALIZED
I'D FEEL TERRIBLE IF I DID GO,

1:03:40.984 --> 1:03:43.278
SO IT'S ON ME.

1:03:45.322 --> 1:03:47.449
WHAT?

1:03:47.449 --> 1:03:51.328
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T GOING
TO GET BACK INTO THIS
UNTIL AFTER THE HOLIDAYS?

1:03:51.328 --> 1:03:53.955
WELL, ZACK WAS PUSHING ME
FOR A DECISION, SO I MADE ONE.

1:03:53.955 --> 1:03:55.373
WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE
MADE IT TOGETHER.

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:56.833
WHY, SO YOU COULD TALK ME
OUT OF IT AGAIN?

1:03:58.126 --> 1:03:59.503
BRADY, YOU JUST--

1:03:59.503 --> 1:04:01.129
YOU DON'T KNOW ME
WELL ENOUGH
OR LONG ENOUGH

1:04:01.129 --> 1:04:03.256
TO MAKE SUCH A MAJOR
LIFE CHOICE LIKE THIS.

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:05.175
OKAY, SO TELL ME EVERYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

1:04:05.175 --> 1:04:06.551
DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING OUT.

1:04:06.551 --> 1:04:08.094
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

1:04:08.094 --> 1:04:09.471
SEE, I THINK IT IS.

1:04:09.471 --> 1:04:12.474
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE...
FREESPIRITED THAN I AM.

1:04:12.474 --> 1:04:14.267
I'M A FREE-SPIRIT?

1:04:14.267 --> 1:04:16.520
THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM.

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.730
DID YOU EVER THINK
THAT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
FREE-SPIRITED ENOUGH?

1:04:18.730 --> 1:04:21.149
ONLY EVERY SINGLE OF MY LIFE,

1:04:21.149 --> 1:04:23.860
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY I... THOUGHT...

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.612
THINK... YOU COULD
BE GOOD FOR ME.

1:04:26.613 --> 1:04:29.324
JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1:04:29.324 --> 1:04:31.493
IF I THOUGHT THAT,
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
RIGHT NOW,

1:04:31.493 --> 1:04:33.704
WHICH...
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE.

1:04:33.704 --> 1:04:35.372
I SHOULD BE HOME
FINISHING MY ARTICLE.

1:04:35.372 --> 1:04:37.833
YEAH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE...

1:04:37.833 --> 1:04:39.751
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A CUE
FROM YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER,

1:04:39.751 --> 1:04:42.212
WHO FELL FOR SOMEBODY
THAT HE'D ONLY KNOWN
FOR A WEEK,

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:45.089
YEAH, AND I THINK YOU KNOW
HOW WELL THAT TURNED OUT.

1:04:56.267 --> 1:04:57.602
BRADY... WAIT.

1:05:01.898 --> 1:05:05.360
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE,

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:06.862
TAKE SOME TIME.

1:05:08.405 --> 1:05:10.073
JUST LIKE THAT?

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:13.159
WHAT ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS?

1:05:14.870 --> 1:05:16.913
I'M SORRY. I JUST
THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.

1:05:18.832 --> 1:05:20.083
OKAY.

1:05:21.543 --> 1:05:22.919
JUST KNOW

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:24.504
THAT THAT JERK

1:05:24.504 --> 1:05:25.839
THAT DUMPED YOU
ON CHRISTMAS EVE

1:05:25.839 --> 1:05:26.964
FOR HIS YOGA TEACHER?

1:05:28.299 --> 1:05:29.885
I AM NOT THAT GUY.

1:05:38.518 --> 1:05:39.853
( CRYING SOFTLY )

1:05:51.656 --> 1:05:56.536
( POP MUSIC PLAYING )

1:05:58.204 --> 1:06:00.582
WHAT IF I'VE TOTALLY
BLOWN IT?

1:06:00.582 --> 1:06:03.126
I'M SURE BRADY WILL ACCEPT
YOUR APOLOGY IN A SECOND.

1:06:03.126 --> 1:06:05.086
MY APOLOGY?
FOR WHAT?

1:06:05.086 --> 1:06:07.672
THINKING OF HIS FUTURE
AND TRYING NOT
TO HOLD HIM BACK?

1:06:07.672 --> 1:06:10.091
I MEAN MY ARTICLE!
IT'S DUE TOMORROW.

1:06:10.091 --> 1:06:12.677
I STILL DON'T HAVE
AN ACTUAL ENDING
TO THE OWEN-JESSICA SAGA.

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:14.011
COULDN'T YOU JUST
MAKE SOMETHING UP?

1:06:14.011 --> 1:06:15.096
I MEAN, WHO'S GOING TO KNOW?

1:06:15.096 --> 1:06:17.432
YOU CAN'T MAKE UP THE FACTS.

1:06:17.432 --> 1:06:18.767
THAT'S CALLED "FICTION."

1:06:18.767 --> 1:06:20.894
I CALL IT FLEXIBILITY,
BUT, HEY, THAT'S ME.

1:06:20.894 --> 1:06:24.021
AS FOR BRADY, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.

1:06:24.021 --> 1:06:26.524
WHO WOULDN'T WANT
A GUY WHO PUTS HER FIRST?

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:27.692
IT'S TOO MUCH, TOO FAST,

1:06:27.692 --> 1:06:29.068
AND I DON'T TRUST IT,

1:06:29.068 --> 1:06:30.779
BUT, HEY, THAT'S ME.

1:06:30.779 --> 1:06:32.029
MORE WINE? YES, PLEASE.

1:06:40.079 --> 1:06:41.539
SO, I...

1:06:41.539 --> 1:06:43.040
EVENING, LADIES.
HI.

1:06:44.709 --> 1:06:46.711
WHERE'S YOUR
ARTIST FRIEND?

1:06:46.711 --> 1:06:48.880
UH, WE'RE...

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:50.423
TAKING KIND OF A "TIME OUT."

1:06:50.423 --> 1:06:53.259
FROM WHAT,
"NOT EXACTLY DATING"?

1:06:54.719 --> 1:06:56.638
THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:01.225
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO ASK HER TO DANCE,

1:07:01.225 --> 1:07:02.602
WOULD YOU DO IT ALREADY?

1:07:02.602 --> 1:07:04.312
OTHERWISE,
WE'RE GETTING A REFILL.

1:07:04.312 --> 1:07:06.397
SURE, OKAY.

1:07:06.397 --> 1:07:08.441
CARE TO DANCE?

1:07:11.569 --> 1:07:12.696
SURE.

1:07:20.495 --> 1:07:23.748
( POP MUSIC CHANGES TO
"ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH" )

1:07:24.958 --> 1:07:26.459
PERFECT TIMING.

1:07:26.459 --> 1:07:28.753
"ANGELS WE HAVE
HEARD ON HIGH?" REALLY?

1:07:28.753 --> 1:07:30.672
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM CHRISTMAS,

1:07:30.672 --> 1:07:32.716
ESPECIALLY AT
A CHRISTMAS PARTY.

1:07:36.678 --> 1:07:38.304
GOOD NEWS.

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:40.139
THEY ACCEPTED
MY OFFER ON THE CONDO.

1:07:40.139 --> 1:07:41.766
I CLOSE NEXT MONTH.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:45.478
WOW. LOOK AT YOU,

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:47.564
KNOCKING DOWN THOSE GOALS
LIKE BOWLING PINS.

1:07:47.564 --> 1:07:49.065
THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

1:07:50.525 --> 1:07:52.527
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO SEE IT.

1:07:57.156 --> 1:07:58.491
( MUSIC STOPS,
POWER SHUTS DOWN )

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:07.375
( MUSIC STARTS,
POWER TURNS ON )

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:09.711
THAT WAS NOT
PERFECT TIMING.

1:08:11.838 --> 1:08:14.591
OR MAYBE IT WAS.
I DON'T KNOW...

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:18.511
DEREK, I'M SO SORRY.

1:08:19.804 --> 1:08:21.389
I HAVE TO GO.

1:08:26.310 --> 1:08:27.729
OH!
WHOA!

1:08:27.729 --> 1:08:28.772
SORRY.

1:08:28.772 --> 1:08:30.023
YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

1:08:30.023 --> 1:08:31.816
YOU'LL HAVE MY ARTICLE
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

1:08:31.816 --> 1:08:33.068
TOMORROW, 4:00 P.M.

1:08:33.068 --> 1:08:35.111
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THE BACKUP PIECE CAME IN,

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:36.487
AND IT'S PRETTY TERRIFIC...

1:08:36.487 --> 1:08:39.198
BUT I'M EXPECTING YOURS
TO BE EVEN BETTER.

1:08:51.544 --> 1:08:52.921
GOT YOU A TEA.

1:08:52.921 --> 1:08:54.505
THANKS.

1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:09.062
I KNOW THIS ISN'T NEWS,
BUT RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD,

1:09:10.146 --> 1:09:12.774
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME
STARTED ON MARRIAGE.

1:09:12.774 --> 1:09:15.610
I JUST WASN'T
READY FOR THIS.

1:09:15.610 --> 1:09:18.154
WELL, I MEAN,
WHO'S EVER READY FOR LOVE?

1:09:18.154 --> 1:09:19.656
YOU KNOW, IT HAPPENS.

1:09:20.949 --> 1:09:22.533
YOU KNOW, IT FINDS YOU...

1:09:22.533 --> 1:09:25.662
YOU JUMP IN THE DEEP END
AND SWIM FOR DEAR LIFE.

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:27.246
WHAT IF YOU DROWN?

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:33.044
SWEETHEART,
DID I EVER TELL YOU

1:09:34.045 --> 1:09:36.131
THAT YOUR MOTHER AND I
ALMOST SPLIT UP

1:09:36.131 --> 1:09:38.424
THAT FIRST CHRISTMAS EVE
THAT WE SPENT TOGETHER?

1:09:38.424 --> 1:09:39.634
REALLY?

1:09:39.634 --> 1:09:41.302
SHE ALWAYS SAYS
HOW YOU TWO WERE

1:09:41.302 --> 1:09:43.387
CRAZY ABOUT EACH OTHER
RIGHT FROM THE START.

1:09:43.387 --> 1:09:45.222
OH, YEAH, WE WERE.

1:09:45.222 --> 1:09:47.517
"OPPOSITES ATTRACT,"
AND ALL THAT...

1:09:47.517 --> 1:09:49.185
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:51.604
WE WERE BOTH
JOCKEYING FOR CONTROL.

1:09:51.604 --> 1:09:55.150
WE HAD DIFFERENT PRIORITIES,
DIFFERENT APPROACHES...

1:09:55.150 --> 1:09:57.527
AND ON THAT
PARTICULAR NIGHT...

1:09:57.527 --> 1:10:01.364
OUR OWN WAYS
OF DECORATING
A CHRISTMAS TREE.

1:10:01.364 --> 1:10:04.909
UH-OH,
MOM AND HER CHRISTMAS TREES.

1:10:04.909 --> 1:10:06.911
OH, YEAH.

1:10:06.911 --> 1:10:08.621
I WANTED TO START
AT THE TOP AND WORK DOWN,

1:10:08.621 --> 1:10:10.206
SHE WANTED TO START
AT THE BOTTOM UP AND WORK UP,

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:11.374
AND THAT WAS
JUST THE START OF IT.

1:10:11.374 --> 1:10:12.917
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
THE LIGHTS, THE TINSEL,

1:10:12.917 --> 1:10:15.128
THE NUMBER OF ORNAMENTS,
THE KIND OF ORNAMENTS.

1:10:15.128 --> 1:10:18.381
I MEAN, WE DISAGREED
ABOUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

1:10:18.381 --> 1:10:21.592
WE WERE BOTH SO SET
ON OUR OWN FAMILY TRADITIONS.

1:10:21.592 --> 1:10:24.387
AND I MEAN,
AN OUTSIDE CHRISTMAS TREE?

1:10:24.387 --> 1:10:27.015
WHAT WAS THAT?
( LAUGHS )

1:10:27.015 --> 1:10:29.392
WELL, THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW
IS WHAT IT WAS.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:32.187
WE HAD A...
A HUGE FIGHT,

1:10:32.187 --> 1:10:34.438
AND I GOT IN MY CAR
AND I JUST DROVE OFF.

1:10:34.438 --> 1:10:37.358
AND I REALLY HAD NO IDEA
IF I WAS EVER COMING BACK.

1:10:37.358 --> 1:10:39.443
BUT YOU DID.

1:10:41.112 --> 1:10:42.906
YEAH, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER.

1:10:45.324 --> 1:10:47.077
BUT...

1:10:47.077 --> 1:10:49.162
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

1:10:49.162 --> 1:10:51.873
WE JUST FINISHED
DECORATING THE TREE

1:10:51.873 --> 1:10:53.166
AND THEN, TOGETHER,

1:10:53.166 --> 1:10:54.918
WE PUT YOUR
GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S ANGEL

1:10:54.918 --> 1:10:56.878
RIGHT ON THE TOP.

1:10:58.713 --> 1:11:00.215
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1:11:00.215 --> 1:11:01.841
SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

1:11:04.177 --> 1:11:05.344
SO, I DON'T KNOW...

1:11:06.804 --> 1:11:09.599
MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT ANGEL OF YOURS.

1:11:10.767 --> 1:11:12.393
I NEVER KNEW
THAT STORY.

1:11:15.105 --> 1:11:17.982
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME?

1:11:17.982 --> 1:11:19.316
( CHUCKLES )

1:11:19.316 --> 1:11:21.318
MOM: HE'S TRYING
TO TELL YOU
THAT RUNNING AWAY

1:11:21.318 --> 1:11:23.196
ISN'T ALWAYS THE ONLY OPTION.

1:11:26.157 --> 1:11:27.825
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
DARLING?

1:11:27.825 --> 1:11:29.285
YES, OF COURSE, DARLING.

1:11:29.285 --> 1:11:31.079
( ALL LAUGH )

"IN THE END,

ABOUT THEIR FUTURE..."

"BUT HOW?

1:11:44.884 --> 1:11:46.719
"AND DID THEY
REGRET IT FOREVER,

BY THEIR CHOICES?"

1:14:02.939 --> 1:14:04.399
UGH. NO.

1:14:04.399 --> 1:14:06.483
DID HE SAY WHERE HE WAS GOING?

1:14:07.735 --> 1:14:08.986
HIS CABIN?

1:14:10.113 --> 1:14:12.615
ONE CHRISTMAS BLEND!
EXTRA LARGE!

1:14:40.268 --> 1:14:41.602
EXCUSE ME?

1:14:41.602 --> 1:14:44.939
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE
HOWE FAMILY CABIN IS?

1:15:16.971 --> 1:15:19.265
( BELL RINGS )

1:15:20.975 --> 1:15:22.101
BRADY?

1:15:28.774 --> 1:15:29.900
SUSAN?

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.110
OH, HELLO! HI!

1:15:33.570 --> 1:15:35.031
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE?

1:15:39.952 --> 1:15:41.454
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1:15:41.454 --> 1:15:44.915
YOU SAID MURPHYSBURG, SO...

1:15:44.915 --> 1:15:48.336
I ASKED IN TOWN,
AND THEY DIRECTED ME HERE.

1:15:48.336 --> 1:15:50.587
THIS PLACE IS LOVELY,
BY THE WAY.

1:15:50.587 --> 1:15:52.131
FOR SOMEBODY
THAT DOESN'T LIKE SURPRISES,

1:15:52.131 --> 1:15:53.716
YOU SURE KNOW HOW TO GIVE ONE.

1:15:55.092 --> 1:15:56.511
YOU MEAN,
LIKE THE ANGEL PAINTING?

1:15:57.761 --> 1:16:00.431
THAT WAS AMAZING.
THANK YOU.

1:16:01.849 --> 1:16:03.809
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1:16:03.809 --> 1:16:04.894
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE

1:16:04.894 --> 1:16:06.479
JUST TEXTED ME
THANK YOU, THOUGH,

1:16:06.479 --> 1:16:08.523
SAVED YOURSELF
THE TRIP.

1:16:08.523 --> 1:16:11.734
YEAH, WELL...
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

1:16:11.734 --> 1:16:13.319

1:16:13.319 --> 1:16:14.695

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:17.156
COME ON.

1:16:22.745 --> 1:16:24.830
I... I WENT
TO THE MARKET EARLIER.

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:26.332
I GOT SOME GROCERIES,

1:16:26.332 --> 1:16:28.125
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
"STARVING ARTIST" THING

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:29.585
IS A LITTLE OVERRATED.

1:16:34.048 --> 1:16:35.716
WHY DID YOU REALLY
COME OUT HERE, SUSAN?

1:16:38.635 --> 1:16:40.888
BRADY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

1:16:40.888 --> 1:16:43.182
YOU'RE NOT STEVE,
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:46.060
BUT YOU'RE ALSO

1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:47.853
NOT LIKE MOST
OTHER GUYS I MEET,

1:16:47.853 --> 1:16:50.481
AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME,
THAT'S SCARY.

1:16:51.648 --> 1:16:53.401
YOU THROW IN
MY CHRISTMAS ANGST

1:16:53.401 --> 1:16:55.861
AND YOUR WHOLE...
NEW YORK/L.A. THING...

1:16:55.861 --> 1:16:58.864
AND THERE'S
SO MANY ROADBLOCKS.

1:16:58.864 --> 1:17:01.909
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I WAS
RETHINKING ZACK'S OFFER?

1:17:01.909 --> 1:17:03.660
MAYBE GO ON OUT WEST
AFTER ALL?

1:17:05.162 --> 1:17:07.039
I'D SAY THAT'S GREAT.

1:17:08.124 --> 1:17:10.460
DO IT...
AND WE'LL PLAY IT OUT.

1:17:12.753 --> 1:17:16.715

A FANTASTIC CHRISTMAS EVE...

1:17:21.845 --> 1:17:23.264
WOW.

1:17:23.264 --> 1:17:26.517
YOU'RE... YOU'RE OKAY
WITH NOT HAVING A "PLAN?"

1:17:26.517 --> 1:17:28.144
FOR US, I MEAN?

1:17:28.144 --> 1:17:30.020
I STILL DON'T HAVE
AN ACTUAL ENDING

1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:31.439
FOR MY ARTICLE,

1:17:31.439 --> 1:17:33.483
BUT I'M TURNING
IT IN ANYWAY.

1:17:33.483 --> 1:17:35.568
SO, YEAH, YEAH...

1:17:36.777 --> 1:17:38.237
I GUESS I AM OKAY.

1:17:39.989 --> 1:17:41.115
YOU?

1:17:42.366 --> 1:17:45.328
FOR A "FREE SPIRIT,"
I AM FEELING
WEIRDLY GROUNDED.

1:17:54.753 --> 1:17:56.713
I HAVE TO AT LEAST TRY
TO WRAP THIS THING UP.

1:17:56.713 --> 1:17:59.550
I'M JUST GOING
TO GO GRAB MY LAPTOP.

1:17:59.550 --> 1:18:01.135
THERE'S A REALLY COOL OLD DESK
YOU CAN WORK AT IN HERE.

1:18:01.135 --> 1:18:02.512
IT'S BEEN HERE FOR AGES.

1:18:02.512 --> 1:18:04.013
USED TO BELONG
TO MY GREAT-GRANDMA.

1:18:04.013 --> 1:18:05.139
SOUNDS PERFECT.

1:18:36.795 --> 1:18:38.589
( FLOPS )
OH!

1:18:42.968 --> 1:18:44.970
BRADY?

1:18:44.970 --> 1:18:46.514
BRADY, ARE YOU OUT THERE?

1:18:48.516 --> 1:18:50.934
"TO SOMEONE WHO WILL ONE DAY
WRITE OUR STORY."

1:18:51.977 --> 1:18:53.396
WERE YOU CALLING ME?

1:18:53.396 --> 1:18:54.855
UH, YEAH.

1:18:54.855 --> 1:18:56.524
SORRY. I WAS TRYING
TO FIND A PEN,

1:18:56.524 --> 1:18:57.941
AND, UH...

1:19:03.698 --> 1:19:05.199
THESE ARE ADDRESSED
TO MY GREAT-GRANDMA MABEL,

1:19:05.199 --> 1:19:07.451
IN MANHATTAN.

1:19:07.451 --> 1:19:10.204
YOUR GREAT-GRANDMA'S NAME
WAS MABEL McNUTT?

1:19:10.204 --> 1:19:12.039
IT WAS HER MAIDEN NAME.

1:19:12.039 --> 1:19:13.624
I'M SURE SHE COULDN'T WAIT
TO CHANGE IT.

1:19:13.624 --> 1:19:15.167
I KNOW I WOULD.

1:19:15.167 --> 1:19:19.463
WAIT, THIS ONE'S POSTMARKED
"BETHLEHEM, PA."

1:19:21.465 --> 1:19:22.883
THEY ALL ARE.

1:19:22.883 --> 1:19:24.760
BRADY, THAT'S WHERE
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS FROM!

1:19:25.886 --> 1:19:27.513
REALLY? THAT'S WEIRD.

1:19:32.435 --> 1:19:33.894
WHAT'S WRONG?

1:19:40.067 --> 1:19:41.736
"OWEN THOMAS,

1:19:41.736 --> 1:19:44.739
10 SYCAMORE CIRCLE,
BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA."

1:19:46.782 --> 1:19:47.950
IS THAT...?

1:19:53.748 --> 1:19:56.751
WHY WOULD YOUR GREAT-GRANDPA

1:19:56.751 --> 1:19:59.211
BE WRITING LETTERS
TO MY GREAT-GRANDMA?

1:20:03.048 --> 1:20:06.552
BECAUSE SHE WAS
YOUR OLD RELATIVE
WHO ACTED IN THE THEATER,

1:20:06.552 --> 1:20:10.931
WHO HAD THE WORLD'S
LEAST GLAMOROUS NAME
FOR AN ACTRESS,

1:20:11.932 --> 1:20:13.601
SO SHE CHANGED IT
TO "JESSICA ROSE."

1:20:16.687 --> 1:20:18.272
BRADY, DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT THIS MEANS?

1:20:18.272 --> 1:20:21.942
THAT YOUR GREAT-GRANDPA
AND MY GREAT-GRANDMA
WERE ONCE IN LOVE?

1:20:25.821 --> 1:20:28.658
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO FIND THESE LETTERS.

1:20:30.993 --> 1:20:32.745
WELL, GO AHEAD, READ ONE.

1:20:33.788 --> 1:20:34.789
YEAH?
YEAH.

1:20:34.789 --> 1:20:35.914
OKAY.

1:20:42.171 --> 1:20:43.589
"MY DARLING MABEL..."

1:20:43.589 --> 1:20:46.008
HE CALLED HER "MABEL,"
NOT JESSICA.

1:20:46.008 --> 1:20:47.843
"IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART

1:20:47.843 --> 1:20:50.971
THAT I AM FORCED TO SAY
GOODBYE TO YOU FOREVER..."

1:20:50.971 --> 1:20:52.515
OWEN:<i> WHEN YOU SAID</i>
<i>ACCEPTING THE ANGEL</i>

1:20:52.515 --> 1:20:54.933
<i>WOULD MEAN ACCEPTING ME</i>
<i>AS YOUR HUSBAND</i>

1:20:54.933 --> 1:20:57.603
<i>AND THAT YOUR TRUE HEART</i>
<i>WAS IN THE THEATER,</i>

1:20:57.603 --> 1:20:59.814
<i>I WAS CRUSHED.</i>

1:20:59.814 --> 1:21:01.398
<i>BUT, HARD AS IT IS TO ADMIT,</i>

1:21:01.398 --> 1:21:03.734
<i>I NOW WONDER</i>
<i>IF THAT WAS A SIGN,</i>

1:21:03.734 --> 1:21:06.612
<i>MAYBE EVEN</i>
<i>FROM THE ANGEL HERSELF,</i>

1:21:06.612 --> 1:21:09.990
<i>THAT WE ARE NOT DESTINED</i>
<i>TO BE TOGETHER,</i>

1:21:09.990 --> 1:21:12.284
<i>AND THAT EVEN</i>
<i>GREATER LOVE AWAITS.</i>

1:21:23.045 --> 1:21:24.463
BRADY...

1:21:24.463 --> 1:21:27.174
THIS IS THE COTTAGE HE BUILT
FOR YOUR GREAT-GRANDMOTHER,

1:21:28.425 --> 1:21:30.344
WITH THAT OLD
BLUEPRINT WE SAW!

1:21:31.846 --> 1:21:33.096
LOOKS LIKE SHE FOUND
THE PLACE AFTER ALL.

1:21:33.096 --> 1:21:35.307
AND MADE IT
A HOME AWAY FROM HOME

1:21:35.307 --> 1:21:36.851
FOR HER AND GREAT-GRANDPA HOWE.

1:21:36.851 --> 1:21:38.561
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

1:21:39.854 --> 1:21:42.147
SO, LET'S SEE...

1:21:42.147 --> 1:21:44.983
OWEN AND MABEL
BOTH FELL IN LOVE AGAIN,

1:21:44.983 --> 1:21:47.319
THEY BOTH HAD GREAT FAMILIES,

1:21:47.319 --> 1:21:49.613
AND BOTH LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

1:21:49.613 --> 1:21:50.947
YEAH.

1:21:52.491 --> 1:21:54.368
LOOKS LIKE THAT ANGEL KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS DOING AFTER ALL.

1:21:54.368 --> 1:21:56.995
I THINK SHE STILL DOES.

1:21:56.995 --> 1:21:59.248
DID I TELL YOU SHE WHACKED
THE HECK OUT OF DEREK?

1:21:59.248 --> 1:22:01.500
ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S MY KIND OF ANGEL.

1:22:04.169 --> 1:22:07.339
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
THIS MEANS, DON'T YOU?

1:22:07.339 --> 1:22:11.134
YEAH! YES!
I NOW HAVE A PHENOMENAL
ENDING FOR MY ARTICLE.

1:22:11.134 --> 1:22:14.471
OH, NOT A MINUTE TOO SOON!
WHICH IS COMPLETELY GREAT...

1:22:14.471 --> 1:22:16.891
BUT I WONDER
IF MAYBE THE REAL REASON

1:22:16.891 --> 1:22:19.017
OUR GREAT-GRANDPARENTS
DIDN'T GET TOGETHER WAS...

1:22:20.477 --> 1:22:21.812
SO THAT WE COULD.

1:22:24.774 --> 1:22:28.026
ARE YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT THAT MOVE TO L.A.?

1:22:29.069 --> 1:22:31.781
YEAH. I'M KIND OF RETHINKING
MY RETHINKING.

1:22:31.781 --> 1:22:33.365
BRADY, NO.

1:22:33.365 --> 1:22:35.618
I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE TO PUT
YOUR WORK FIRST.

1:22:35.618 --> 1:22:36.911
WHY? YOU DIDN'T.

1:22:36.911 --> 1:22:38.454
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1:22:38.454 --> 1:22:42.416
UM, WHO LEFT NEW YORK WITHOUT
FINISHING HER DO-OR-DIE ARTICLE

1:22:42.416 --> 1:22:44.000
JUST TO COME AFTER ME?

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:47.129
OKAY, I DIDN'T EXACTLY
"COME AFTER" YOU.

1:22:47.129 --> 1:22:48.839
OH, YOU COMPLETELY DID.

1:22:48.839 --> 1:22:52.509
YOU PUT ME FIRST,
WHICH IS HUGE!

1:22:52.509 --> 1:22:54.678
SO, NO, I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY...

1:22:57.097 --> 1:22:58.515
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

1:23:10.820 --> 1:23:13.196
ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD RUN AWAY.

1:23:13.196 --> 1:23:15.407
BUT JUST FOR AN HOUR.
I HAVE AN ENDING TO WRITE!

1:23:16.784 --> 1:23:17.910
OKAY.

1:23:50.693 --> 1:23:52.486
MAKE ME PROUD, ANGEL.

1:23:54.613 --> 1:23:55.739
( DOOR OPENS )

1:23:57.240 --> 1:23:58.951
YOU FINISHED?
YEP.

1:24:00.243 --> 1:24:01.620
NOW WE JUST WAIT
FOR TOMORROW'S PAPER

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:03.330
TO SEE IF I HAVE A FUTURE
AS A WRITER.

1:24:03.330 --> 1:24:05.123
NO PRESSURE.

1:24:05.123 --> 1:24:06.542
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME...

1:24:06.542 --> 1:24:08.669
YOU WANT TO...
DECORATE A CHRISTMAS TREE?

1:24:10.253 --> 1:24:12.381

CONGRATULATIONS,
MS. STAFF WRITER.

1:25:22.868 --> 1:25:24.244
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

1:25:24.244 --> 1:25:25.704
NO... YOU COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT

1:25:25.704 --> 1:25:27.163
WITHOUT OUR
GREAT-GRANDPARENTS.

1:25:27.163 --> 1:25:29.750
OH, AND THE ANGEL,
OF COURSE.

1:25:31.752 --> 1:25:33.712
MERRY CHRISTMAS, BRADY.

1:25:33.712 --> 1:25:35.631
