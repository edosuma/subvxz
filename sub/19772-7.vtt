♪♪

00:03.670 --> 00:05.080
Previously on Andi Mack:

00:05.080 --> 00:07.290
I saw Amber in the park
with someone else.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.620
-She was?
-Tell the truth.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.670
Why would I lie about seeing you
with another guy?

00:12.670 --> 00:14.380
Because you like Jonah.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.880
-Do you know who my dad is?
-Yes, but...

00:16.880 --> 00:18.330
His daughter wants to know him.

00:18.330 --> 00:20.000
I don't want to write him.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.500
Ham:
 This is his e-mail.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.380
-(doorbell rings)
-Bex!

00:23.380 --> 00:25.830
-Oh, hey, Mrs. Mack.
-(whimpers)

00:25.830 --> 00:27.000
Andi...

00:27.000 --> 00:29.460
This is your dad.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.620
Bex:
Bowie.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.830
Bowie: It's just blowing my mind.
It...

00:34.830 --> 00:37.080
This is for real.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.000
I have a kid...

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
who's... already a teenager?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.750
Don't feel bad.
She didn't tell me either.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.170
This whole time,
I thought she was my sister.

00:47.170 --> 00:48.710
Mack!

00:48.710 --> 00:50.580
That is whack.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.460
Whack-adactyl, yo.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.920
I mean, double-whacker
with cheese.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.620
Whack to the future.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.330
Yo, check it!

00:57.330 --> 00:58.620
Fruit of my looms!

00:58.620 --> 01:01.380
Oh, this moment is far worse
than I ever imagined.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.670
So, Bowie...
(chuckles)

01:03.670 --> 01:05.330
...are you
still playing drums?

01:05.330 --> 01:06.960
And some guitar too.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.460
I'm about to go on tour.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.500
Do you know Renaissance Boys?

01:10.500 --> 01:12.380
You're in Renaissance Boys?

01:12.380 --> 01:14.170
Yeah, just filling in
for one of the boys,

01:14.170 --> 01:16.920
but I'm psyched to be playing with a
band people have actually heard of.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.830
I've totally heard of them.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.500
That is so cool!

01:20.500 --> 01:21.830
Hey...

01:21.830 --> 01:24.420
Would it be okay
if I borrowed Andi today?

01:24.420 --> 01:26.830
You know, we could hang out,
get to know each other.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.460
Yes, yes, yes.

01:28.460 --> 01:29.920
Please, please,

01:29.920 --> 01:31.170
-please?
-Absolutely not.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.960
Get ready,
you're going to school.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.290
Please, please, please?

01:35.290 --> 01:39.170
-What is he doing here? Did
you summon him? -Sum--

01:39.170 --> 01:41.540
Yes. I said his name three
times in front of a mirror.

01:41.540 --> 01:44.380
No. Uh...
This is on me.

01:44.380 --> 01:46.290
I gave Bex his e-mail

01:46.290 --> 01:48.210
and suggested
that she reach out to him.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.120
Bowie: Ham and I
are Facepage buds.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.170
-(laughs)
-Heh, yeah!

01:53.670 --> 01:55.460
I'm sorry.

01:55.460 --> 01:57.120
I...

01:57.120 --> 01:58.670
I should've told you.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.380
-No, no... no.
-I-- I...

02:02.080 --> 02:05.290
She's gonna be okay.

02:05.290 --> 02:09.419
-There's a distinct possibility, though,
she may start, uh... -(door slams)

02:09.419 --> 02:10.919
pruning.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.250
-Ah...
-(sighs)

02:12.250 --> 02:14.040
There she goes.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.000
You know what?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.880
Um, maybe school isn't
such a bad idea.

Yeah, well, things at home went
from fake sick to real crazy.

03:28.620 --> 03:30.500
You guys won't believe
what happened.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.040
You won't believe

It's a good thing

03:35.540 --> 03:36.620

Jonah and Amber broke up!

For real.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.330
You're sure?

03:46.330 --> 03:48.000
It was confirmed
by three sources,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.380
and one of them
was Jonah.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.000
He's a free agent.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.040
Aren't you glad you
came to school today?

03:53.040 --> 03:56.420
It probably doesn't
mean anything for me.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.830
But what if it does?

03:59.080 --> 04:01.920
He could be
with anyone he wanted.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.750
But what if it's me?

04:03.750 --> 04:05.290
I think it's you.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.710

04:35.710 --> 04:37.000
Bowie:
Andi!

04:37.000 --> 04:39.210
-There she is!
-Who's that?

04:39.210 --> 04:41.420
It doesn't matter.
What were you going to say?

04:41.420 --> 04:42.960
I'll tell you later.

04:44.620 --> 04:45.880
Okay.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.080
Here she is.
My kid, Andi Mack.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.120
Well, I've spoken
with your mom...

04:50.120 --> 04:51.670
-Which one?
-...and your dad--

04:51.670 --> 04:53.380
The biological one, I believe.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.040
So, Bex is your mother,

04:55.040 --> 04:58.000
-and she says that this
is your father-- -Bowie.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.620
Bowie Quinn.

04:59.620 --> 05:02.170
And she's given permission for the two
of you to spend the day together.

05:02.170 --> 05:06.830
I understand that this is a time of
transition for you and your family,

05:06.830 --> 05:09.620
and we just want to be as
supportive as we possibly can.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.880
Both:
Thanks, Ms. Dullridge.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.620
It's like how pythons
unhinge their jaws

05:17.620 --> 05:20.040
to swallow
their entire prey.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.920
I mean, that's what my brain
had to do this morning.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.710
Well, their jaws don't
actually unhinge,

05:25.710 --> 05:27.960
but I get your point.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.500
I mean, yesterday,
I was just "Bowie."

05:30.500 --> 05:34.960
Today, I'm "Bowie...
with child."

05:34.960 --> 05:37.040
Did you even want kids?

05:37.040 --> 05:39.830
And, yes, I realize this is
an awkward question,

05:39.830 --> 05:43.120
-especially coming from your kid.
-(chuckles)

05:43.120 --> 05:45.710
I never really thought
about it, to be honest,

05:45.710 --> 05:49.040
but the universe did.
You know, the universe knew.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.920
The universe always knows.

05:52.170 --> 05:55.920
We're gonna have the best
father and daughter day ever!

05:55.920 --> 05:59.000
-Are you stoked?
-You bet, but...

05:59.000 --> 06:01.920
But I probably shouldn't miss
the whole day of school.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.080
-(laughs)
-What?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.960
Don't take this wrong, but you've
got a lot of Celia in you.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.170
I mean, you've got this
whole type A thing going on.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.920
You know, you need a little bit
more of what I've got.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.790
You know, like a
type-Bowie thing going on.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.920
Live in the moment.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.420
(sniffs)

06:21.420 --> 06:23.460
Do you smell french fries?

06:23.460 --> 06:25.670
Oh, that's my car.
It's a grease mobile.

06:25.670 --> 06:26.750
Oh.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.790
Runs on used vegetable oil
from restaurants.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.040
No way!

06:31.040 --> 06:34.080
Free fuel, great mileage,
and most importantly,

06:34.080 --> 06:36.250
it reduces my carbon footprint
on this beautiful planet.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.670
-I'm all about carbon footprints.
-What?

06:38.670 --> 06:40.830
I made this bracelet
from used soda tabs.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.500
You and me are on like
the same brain-length!

06:43.500 --> 06:44.790
I know.

06:44.790 --> 06:45.880
So, what do you say?

06:45.880 --> 06:47.880
Let's make like
a check and bounce!

07:01.920 --> 07:03.540
Have you seen her?

07:03.540 --> 07:05.120
No, have you?

07:05.120 --> 07:08.210
If I'd seen her, I wouldn't
have asked if you'd seen her.

07:08.210 --> 07:11.080
Really? They're not
mutually exclusive.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.880
Cyrus! I need to know
what happened with Jonah!

07:15.250 --> 07:17.380
Where are you?

07:17.380 --> 07:19.250
(phone chirps and buzzes)

07:19.250 --> 07:21.170
Buffy:
"Had to leave school."

07:21.170 --> 07:24.080
What did Jonah want?

07:24.080 --> 07:25.250
(phone chirps)

07:26.880 --> 07:28.500
This is taking forever!

07:28.500 --> 07:30.080
(phone chirps)

07:30.080 --> 07:31.460
"I don't know."

07:31.460 --> 07:33.170
(phone chirps and buzzes)

07:33.170 --> 07:35.000
"Can you find out?"

07:35.000 --> 07:36.380
Can we find out?

07:36.380 --> 07:38.040
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

07:38.040 --> 07:39.120
We will not meddle.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.000
What do you mean?
We're her best friends.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's in our job description.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.120
We're on it.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.960
Oh. Can you
just be on it?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.960
-My blood sugar is kind of low.
-(phone chirps)

07:50.960 --> 07:52.330
Eat an apple.

07:52.330 --> 07:56.040
We're putting the pedal...
come on... to the "meddle."

07:56.040 --> 07:57.250
(whimpers)

08:04.960 --> 08:06.210
Everything good?

08:06.210 --> 08:08.500
Oh, yeah. I just had
to take care of something.

08:09.830 --> 08:13.080
If I ask you a question,
would you be completely honest?

08:13.080 --> 08:14.830
I'll try.

08:14.830 --> 08:17.210
Complete honesty doesn't really
run in the family.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.960
(chuckles)

08:18.960 --> 08:21.670
Am I what you
were hoping for?

08:21.670 --> 08:24.460
Well, this is what
I was hoping for.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.830
-To meet you and--
-Wait, wait, wait! Stop, stop.

08:26.830 --> 08:28.000
I have a genius idea.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.460
-Right.
-Okay.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.620
Today, I became a father,

08:31.620 --> 08:34.289
and this is
my beautiful little girl.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.000
Hi.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.460
She's shy.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.080
Are you shy?

08:40.080 --> 08:42.120
I don't know
very much about her...

08:42.120 --> 08:44.250
You know what?

08:44.250 --> 08:47.040
This would be a lot better
if we had something fun to do.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.000
What do you want to do?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.380
Oh, anything!

08:51.380 --> 08:53.830
Me too!

08:53.830 --> 08:56.120
You know... (exhales)

08:56.120 --> 08:58.080
Universe...

08:58.080 --> 09:00.620
do you have any suggestions?

09:00.620 --> 09:02.920
(inhales)

09:02.920 --> 09:04.920
(exhales)

09:04.920 --> 09:06.880
Mmm...

09:06.880 --> 09:08.960
Maybe the universe
has other things...

09:08.960 --> 09:10.710
-Shh! Shh!
-...she needs to do.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.920
Do you hear that?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.670
Hear what?

09:15.670 --> 09:18.170
-(drums playing faintly)
-Come on!

09:18.170 --> 09:20.710
(playing rhythmically)

09:20.710 --> 09:23.460
-Seren-dopity, am I right?
-It's great!

09:23.460 --> 09:25.290
Come on.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.120
Come on, sit down.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.920
I don't even know how to play.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.120
You're my kid!

09:36.120 --> 09:37.880
You know how to play.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.880
Ready?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.080
One, two...

09:46.080 --> 09:47.420
One, two...

09:50.540 --> 09:52.750
There you go. There you go!

09:52.750 --> 09:54.420
Yeah, all right!

09:54.420 --> 09:57.000
(playing rhythmically)

09:57.000 --> 09:58.460
Bowie:
See?

09:58.460 --> 10:00.420
Nice!

10:15.920 --> 10:18.040
Woo! Yeah!

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
We're not actually going
to play soccer, are we?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.710
Because, I didn't
bring my inhaler.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.710
We're just here
to talk to Jonah.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.540
Okay, good.
So, what's the plan?

10:28.540 --> 10:30.540
What do you mean, plan?

10:30.540 --> 10:34.120
You know, like,
good cop, bad cop.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.000
How about,
talking cop, stay-here cop?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

10:38.750 --> 10:40.460
We need to think
this through.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.040
If I was him...

10:44.290 --> 10:47.420
Oh, it would be
so great if I was him.

10:47.420 --> 10:49.000
Where was I? Right.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.500
I just think he'd be
a little more comfortable

10:50.500 --> 10:54.040
talking to another,
uh... dude.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.710
And, where are
we going to find one?

11:04.960 --> 11:06.250
Mmm.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.880
These are fantastic.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.920
They're my favorite.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.790
I'm going to go see
if I can get a bucket

11:10.790 --> 11:12.670
of the vegetable oil they
used to make these things.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.120
For the grease-mobile.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.960
Exact-a-mundo.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.500
(chuckles)

11:20.540 --> 11:21.920
(phone chirps)

11:26.460 --> 11:27.500
(phone chirps)

11:28.500 --> 11:29.920
(loud crash)

11:29.920 --> 11:31.330
Bowie Quinn for the win!

11:33.250 --> 11:34.880
Jonah:
 Hey, Cyrus.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.000
Is this your gym class?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.120
Maybe.
Yeah, I'm checking it out.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.830
(exhales)

11:40.830 --> 11:42.210
So, uh...

11:42.210 --> 11:44.040
Whassup?
(pops lips)

11:45.080 --> 11:47.040
Nada.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.380
Really?

11:48.380 --> 11:50.960
So you're doing okay
with the breakup?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.960
Come on, brah...
(taps bench)

11:52.960 --> 11:54.790
...let me in.

11:54.790 --> 11:57.120
You got your eye
on anyone else?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.540
Not really.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.120
I don't like talking
about this stuff.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Me neither, man.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.290
But, I mean, if we were
the kind of guys

12:04.290 --> 12:06.120
who liked to talk
about this stuff...

12:06.120 --> 12:08.540
who would we be talking about?

12:08.540 --> 12:11.120
I don't know if I really
want a girlfriend right now.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.080
Whoa, whoa!
JB, JB, JB!

12:14.080 --> 12:15.790
I hear ya, man.

12:15.790 --> 12:18.170
But is that really
what your heart is saying?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.880
'Cause I think your heart
is saying something

12:20.880 --> 12:23.210
that wants to come
out of your mouth.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.250
I don't want
to get hurt again.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.040
You won't.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
You're Jonah Beck.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.000
You're right.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.080
I was
second-guessing myself.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.580
I know what to do now.
Thanks, man.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.210
You want to play?

12:41.210 --> 12:44.420
Ah, you know what? I'm kind of
leaning more towards lacrosse.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.460
What did he say?

12:48.460 --> 12:51.170
Andi is going crazy.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.920
Listen, I put the ball
on the tee,

12:53.920 --> 12:57.040
Andi just has to knock it
out of the park.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.580
Have you not played
any sport since T-ball?

13:00.580 --> 13:03.920
Let's just say,
she's going to be very happy.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.750
What's up?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.750
Nothing.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.790
It's just...

13:15.790 --> 13:18.830
-school's almost over, so...
-Hmm.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.380
Psst.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.120
Don't tell anyone but, um...

13:23.250 --> 13:25.620
school will still
be there tomorrow.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.420
You know, English, Math...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.710
those other ones.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.500
(chuckles)

13:32.500 --> 13:34.620
Those aren't the ones
I'm worried about.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.330
You're worried?

13:36.330 --> 13:39.750
-No! No, not... worried.
-Yes, you are.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.170
I can see it.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.250
What's going on at school?

13:44.250 --> 13:47.080
Mmm... uh...

13:47.080 --> 13:49.960
There's, um, a...

13:49.960 --> 13:51.620
boy?

13:51.620 --> 13:53.920
A boy?

13:53.920 --> 13:55.420
Maybe?

13:55.420 --> 13:58.040
Then what the heck
are we still doing here?

13:58.040 --> 14:00.580
Come on, let's make
like a check and bounce!

14:00.580 --> 14:03.380
Just a saying.
I'm paying with cash.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.290
Come on!

14:07.580 --> 14:09.000
Oh, wait.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.540
Is he here?
Can I meet him?

14:23.540 --> 14:25.290
No!

14:25.290 --> 14:28.170
I-- I mean,
it's a delicate situation.

14:28.170 --> 14:29.750
Understood.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.460
Go forth.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.960
The boy's crazy if
he doesn't like you back.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.540
Thanks.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.830
Maybe we could do
something tomorrow?

14:37.830 --> 14:39.750
I can't.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.540
I'm headed to Memphis tonight.
Got a gig.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.460
Oh. After that?

14:44.460 --> 14:47.000
Well, it's a 40-city tour,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.960
and it's gonna be
pretty epic.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.120
But that's why I was all
about spending today with you.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.670
-You know?
-Uh, I...

14:55.670 --> 14:57.420
I don't have to go.

14:57.420 --> 15:00.040
Andi, follow your heart.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.000
Right?
That's what I'd do.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.420
(chuckles)

15:06.170 --> 15:07.540
(laughs)
You know...

15:07.540 --> 15:09.460
I'm not even going to film
this goodbye,

15:09.460 --> 15:12.380
even though I'm dying to.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.790
(both chuckle)

15:14.830 --> 15:17.000
I really liked meeting you.

15:18.790 --> 15:19.920
Same.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.540
Go, go. Get outta here.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.120
Okay.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.920
Goodbye, baby girl.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.620
(indistinct conversation)

16:21.920 --> 16:24.540
♪ 'Cause I ain't getting over ♪

16:24.540 --> 16:29.170
♪ I ain't getting over you ♪

16:34.080 --> 16:36.040
You said your conversation
with Jonah worked,

16:36.040 --> 16:37.920
but he's back with Amber.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.460
What did you say?

16:39.460 --> 16:41.750
I told him to trust
his instincts.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.040
Well, that was stupid.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.670
You know what was stupid?
Putting pedal to the "meddle."

16:46.670 --> 16:49.170
Which I didn't want to do
in the first place!

16:49.170 --> 16:50.830
What are we going to tell Andi?

16:52.540 --> 16:55.080
The correct answer is:
nothing.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.290
No, that's not right.
We have to.

16:57.290 --> 16:58.460
(door bells tinkling)

17:01.210 --> 17:03.120
She's got enough
going on in her life.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.079
We take this secret
to the grave.

17:07.670 --> 17:09.170
Hi, Andi.

17:09.170 --> 17:12.500
Jonah and Amber, back together.
Are you kidding me?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.040
How did this happen?

17:14.040 --> 17:15.460
No idea.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.619
Did you find out what
he was going to ask me?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.119
Listen, Andi,
about that--

17:20.119 --> 17:22.079
Where were you
all this time?

17:22.079 --> 17:24.540
I was with my dad.
I met my dad.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.040
That's what I was
going to tell you this morning.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.250
-You met your dad?
-Your dad?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.080
He just showed up on
our doorstep this morning.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.210
He didn't even know
he had a kid.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.120
Wow, Andi.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.960
Your life just
keeps getting crazier.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.750
No, but he was really happy
when he found out about me.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.000
I mean, like, really happy.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.670
What's he like?

17:48.670 --> 17:50.420
He's a really cool guy.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.250
He has a car that
runs on vegetable oil.

17:53.250 --> 17:57.750
In fact, right now,
it's running on baby tater oil.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.500
And he taught me
how to play the bongos.

18:00.500 --> 18:05.000
Guys, I can play the bongos!

18:05.000 --> 18:08.120
So everything turned out
to be a great day after all.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.920
That's the moral of this story.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.830
It was great.

18:13.830 --> 18:17.540
But then he had to go,
and now he's gone.

18:17.540 --> 18:21.040
And Jonah's back with Amber,
so he's gone too.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.790
They're both gone.

18:26.330 --> 18:28.920
(whispers)
To the grave.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.170
We're going to need
another round.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.580
Bex:
So did you like him?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.880
Andi:
I did.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.790
I do.

18:45.790 --> 18:48.120
But you know
what I realized?

18:48.120 --> 18:51.210
The whole reason why
he came here was to see you.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.920
I mean, he didn't
even know I existed.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.580
But you didn't really get
to hang out with him, did you?

18:59.580 --> 19:02.420
-That's okay.
-Really?

19:02.420 --> 19:03.960
Because...

19:03.960 --> 19:05.960
I can see why you liked him.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.040
Oh, can you?

19:08.040 --> 19:11.460
Yeah, I mean,
he's different...

19:11.460 --> 19:13.710
unpredictable,

19:13.710 --> 19:15.080
in a good way.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.460
And I didn't know
what was going to happen next,

19:19.460 --> 19:22.580
but I knew
that it would be fun.

19:22.580 --> 19:24.250
All very true.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.710
(chuckles)

19:25.710 --> 19:29.120
So, tell me the story.
How did you guys meet?

19:29.120 --> 19:32.040
Such a cliche.
He was in a band.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.290
-He wrote a song about me.
-He did?

19:34.290 --> 19:36.210
Which they played
at their shows.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.120
He said it was going
to be on their first album,

19:38.120 --> 19:41.380
but they never made
an album.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.080
I wish I'd known. I would have
asked him to play it for me.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.170
Next time.

19:46.170 --> 19:48.080
Do you think
there will be a next time?

19:50.620 --> 19:52.250
I want to say yes...

19:52.250 --> 19:54.040
but I don't know.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.420
Like you said,

19:55.420 --> 19:56.830
unpredictable.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.500
Yours looks so much
better than mine.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.170
(laughs)

20:05.170 --> 20:07.380
You got over-excited.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.920
You don't have
to use every color.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.210
(chuckles)

20:12.210 --> 20:15.170
But you know what?
It's just tape.

20:15.170 --> 20:18.540
You can always take it off
and start over again.

20:18.540 --> 20:20.750
Or you could give me yours,

20:20.750 --> 20:23.670
and make a new one for yourself
'cause you're so good at it.

20:23.670 --> 20:26.750
Nope, but I'll help you.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.210
(giggling)

20:30.210 --> 20:31.620
I want this one.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.040
(laughs)

20:33.040 --> 20:35.120
-Mine. (laughs)
-(laughs)

20:35.120 --> 20:38.790
You know what I really want
to learn to do, is sew.

20:38.790 --> 20:40.790
Oh, you should.

20:40.790 --> 20:42.460
Just not on Cristiano.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
-Who's that?
-My sewing machine.

20:44.460 --> 20:48.080
You named your sewing
machine Cristiano?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.960
He's Italian.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.460
But you can use
my old pink one, if you want.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.880
Let me guess. Pinky?

20:54.880 --> 20:58.040
That is a ridiculous name
for a sewing machine.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.040
You're a ridiculous name
for a sewing machine.

21:01.170 --> 21:03.710
-(shrieking)
-Hey!

21:03.710 --> 21:05.670
I love your guest house!

21:05.670 --> 21:06.920
Bex:
Bowie?

21:06.920 --> 21:08.500
(laughs)

21:09.500 --> 21:11.080
-What's he doing?
-(chuckles)

21:14.540 --> 21:17.210
-Next on Andi Mack:
-I'm glad he's here.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.120
Andi:
 But he has to talk to everybody,

21:19.120 --> 21:21.080
and he won't stop filming me.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.540
I need a break.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.540
It's from Jonah Beck.

21:24.540 --> 21:27.120
-Do you think I'm girly?
-Calm down.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.380
Easy for you to say,
nobody's calling you girly.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.330
I want to be
a part of your lives.

21:32.330 --> 21:36.250
-How? You live on the road.
-I can do something else.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.250
Buffy: I did a good job.
You're my creation.
