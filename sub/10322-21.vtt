Usually when you see
a long line at the Crab Shack,

00:04.638 --> 00:07.775
it's headin' into the bathroom
due to food poisoning.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.811
But today there was a line
'cause someone from
the Camden Savings & Loan...

00:10.878 --> 00:13.714
was givin' away T-shirts
if you qualified
for a credit card.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.917
This is great.
'Cause his little left thumb
is over my left lactatin' spot,

00:16.984 --> 00:19.787
and I carry my purse
on my right side,
so I'm good to go.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.491
Earl, is that the real
Pack-Away the Savings Squirrel?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.693

It's gonna be one of those times
when you think I'm talking
down to you,

I was excited to finally own
a credit card I hadn't stolen.

00:44.112 --> 00:47.915
And Randy was excited
to get a T-shirt
with a smilin' squirrel on it.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.920

Room 231.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.323
For one night,
we stayed in Room 211,
which was bigger,

00:55.389 --> 00:57.825
but it was over
a drug dealer's room.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.862
Sometimes bullets would
come up through the floor
and freak us out, so we moved.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.798
Okay. None.

"What's the last movie you saw?"
'cause I can answer that.

So as far as the bank
was concerned, I was a child.

And what kind of man would want
to be treated like a child?

There I was--
with no job,

02:12.566 --> 02:15.569

no permanent home.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.872

changed since high school.

And I wasn't the only one.
Hey, Earl.
Would you pass the nuts?

02:22.710 --> 02:26.214
Sorry, Randy.
That's funny, but I'm not
in a laughin' mood right now.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.184
Don't beat yourself up too much
about the bank lady making you
feel like a child and whatnot.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.153
At least
you're doing the list.
That's a very adult endeavor.

02:33.221 --> 02:36.857
That list is ridiculous.
He numbers everything on it,
but he never follows the order.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.093
Plus he didn't know
how to spell "catapult,"
so he just drew one on it.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.031
Only reason anybody takes
that thing seriously is 'cause
it's on yellow lawyer paper.

02:44.097 --> 02:48.469
If you screwed yourself out of
being an adult, why don't you
just put yourself on the list?

02:48.536 --> 02:52.506
Sometimes I feel like
your conscience-- like that
little cricket, Jiminy Hiccup.

That way, we get to skip

they write other items
with little letters in front.

I knew it was too late to get
a real high school diploma,

03:39.086 --> 03:42.656
so I decided to get
the next-best thing-- a G.E.D.

03:46.294 --> 03:49.297
I started with math
since I knew I could
count on my fingers.

to the next level.

03:51.299 --> 03:55.669
"In Armando's class,
there are six women
for every two men."

03:55.736 --> 03:58.038

03:58.105 --> 04:01.275
"If there are 12 women,
how many men are there?"

I couldn't quite figure out
how many men there were,

04:03.977 --> 04:07.014
but I did figure out
there would be 24 boobs.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.918
That didn't really help me,
but it probably helped Armando.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.986
Either way, I skipped math.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.460
"Past participle."

04:21.161 --> 04:24.498
Okay. Okay. A "part" is...

04:24.565 --> 04:26.767
like a part of somethin'.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.036
And an "iciple"...

04:29.102 --> 04:31.405
could be like "municipal,"

04:31.472 --> 04:34.207
which I think stands for
"swimming pool."

So, part of a swimmin' pool
in the past.
