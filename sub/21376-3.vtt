00:41.875 --> 00:43.126
Welcome to the show.
I'm your host, James Davis.

00:43.209 --> 00:47.338
Now tonight, we have
a very special episode,

00:47.422 --> 00:48.798
so if you happen to be
sitting next to a guy

00:48.882 --> 00:51.301
with a pastel Oxford shirt

00:51.384 --> 00:52.552
who looks like he plays
lacrosse,

00:52.635 --> 00:55.305
cover up your drink
and grab your rape whistle,

00:55.388 --> 00:57.056
'cause this is "Hood Adjacent:
The College Years."

01:00.560 --> 01:02.812
{\an8}Now tonight's episode

01:02.896 --> 01:05.565
is not about graduating college.

01:05.648 --> 01:08.151
It's just about...college.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.653
If it was about
graduating college,

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
I'd have to give you
the floor.

01:12.405 --> 01:16.034
I went to Pomona for just
under...four years.

01:16.117 --> 01:19.412
But that time there,
40 miles east

01:19.496 --> 01:21.831
of the nearest
Magic Johnson Theater,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.334
it made me who I am today.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.669
I mean, being one of only
a few black students

01:26.753 --> 01:28.004
at a predominately white school,

01:28.087 --> 01:30.632
I learned what it was like
to be a fish out of water.

01:30.715 --> 01:34.469
I was a Tupac fan at a year-long
blink-182 concert.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.054
[laughter]

01:36.137 --> 01:38.723
Don't know the lyrics
or nothing.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.559
Well, yeah, look at me now!

01:41.643 --> 01:44.604
All comfortable around
white people and shit!

01:44.687 --> 01:46.731
There you go,
you [BLEEP] it up, come on!

01:46.815 --> 01:49.025
We gotta be fast!

01:49.108 --> 01:51.152
I'm trying to make a point
to America!

01:51.236 --> 01:54.531
It was a simple high five,
it wasn't like...

01:55.657 --> 01:57.992
Tonight is gonna be
a lot like college.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.328
We're gonna learn.
We're gonna expand our minds.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.913
And when it's all said and done,

02:01.996 --> 02:03.748
we're gonna call our friends
at home and lie to them

02:03.832 --> 02:05.708
about a threesome
we totally had.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.461
[laughter and applause]

02:08.544 --> 02:11.548
Hey dawg, you'll never guess!

02:11.631 --> 02:16.678
It was after lunch.
I skipped a class. It went down.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.804
Now in college,

02:17.887 --> 02:19.556
I was the quintessential
token black friend.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.723
A lot of people, they don't like

02:20.807 --> 02:23.017
being the token black friend.
Me, I love it.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.394
Out of all the brothers
in the world,

02:24.477 --> 02:26.312
they chose me.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.689
I was their LeBron.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.481
There was a black friend
lottery.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.275
I was the number-one draft pick,

02:30.358 --> 02:32.443
and I took my talents
to Caucasia.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.070
[cheers and applause]

02:34.153 --> 02:37.365
And recently, I went back there

02:37.448 --> 02:38.908
to relive some of my glory days.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.953
<i>This is my alma mater.</i>

02:42.036 --> 02:43.830
<i>And in some important ways,</i>

02:43.913 --> 02:45.665
<i>being a token friend</i>
<i>made me who I am.</i>

02:45.748 --> 02:47.500
<i>I wanted to see what things</i>

02:47.584 --> 02:50.795

being a token friend here
at Pomona now.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.406
- I don't know what it was
back in your day, but--

03:18.489 --> 03:19.449
- Let's not say
"Back in your day."

03:19.532 --> 03:21.868
Let's just say
"When you went here."

03:21.951 --> 03:24.287
[laughter]
- But, um...

03:24.370 --> 03:26.956
Going up, showing up
at the parties, like,

03:27.040 --> 03:28.666
I'm always
the only Asian guy in there.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.959
- People just come up
to me like,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.210
"hey, man,
what's the move tonight?"

03:31.294 --> 03:32.378
Like, people always looking
to you for moves.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.464
When you get to the move,
they looking for you

03:34.547 --> 03:35.798
to turn up the move, you know?

03:35.882 --> 03:37.467
Always provide entertainment,

03:37.550 --> 03:38.718
provide jokes, things like that.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.470
- Do they see you as

03:40.553 --> 03:44.474
that cool black friend
from all the TV shows?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.225
- You could say that, yeah.

03:46.309 --> 03:46.935
{\an1}- You're just like the dude
from "She's All That."

03:47.018 --> 03:47.977
- I go into the room,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.979
everyone just kind of, like,

03:50.063 --> 03:51.773
shifts awkwardly in their seats,

03:51.856 --> 03:53.733
don't really know
what to talk to me about.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.526
- So people don't come for you
for the party plans.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.736
- They do not, unfortunately.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.906
I identify as Muslim,
but I still drink, so.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.616
You know, I still party.
- Okay.

04:01.699 --> 04:02.617
- Not just the science dude.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.453
- Asaj tryna turn up too!
- [laughs]

04:08.706 --> 04:09.999
- And what about
on the gay side?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.751
{\an3}What are the expectations
that come from that?

04:11.834 --> 04:12.961
"On the gay side"
is my failed hood attempt

04:13.044 --> 04:15.338
to be politically correct.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.798
For that, I apologize.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.551
I just saved myself
a press conference.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.971
{\an1}- On the gay side,
well, I think...

04:23.054 --> 04:24.430
People assume
that I'm gonna provide

04:24.514 --> 04:27.809
some type of service for
you, like, uh, outfit help,

04:27.892 --> 04:30.061
you know,
like I'm not gonna tell you

04:30.144 --> 04:31.646
if your outfit looks
good all the time.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.773
- So you may be gay,
and you may dress well.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.650
- Yeah.
- But you're your stylist.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.235
Not their stylist!
- Correct.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.736
- Tell me some of the pros

04:38.820 --> 04:40.530
to being a token friend
on campus.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.365
- One of the biggest pros is you
get a lot of free stuff.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.951
Like, white people
like giving you stuff.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.536
I don't know why.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.204
They just like,
"Hey, man, you want beer?

04:48.287 --> 04:49.706
"We got beer,
we got alcohol.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.999
Like, you need some shoes?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.042
- They're giving you shoes?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.753
{\an3}- I've gotten a pair of shoes
from a white friend before.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.130
- Were you shoeless
in the moment?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.756
- No, I had shoes on.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.799
- Now your white friends weren't

04:59.882 --> 05:02.051
offering anybody else shoes?
- No.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.845
- Just you?
- Yeah, it was pretty weird.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.139
- I don't get free clothes
like you, man,

05:06.222 --> 05:08.725
but at least I get to
go into parties.

05:08.808 --> 05:09.976
They check the IDs.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.103
All you gotta do is find another
Asian dude, like,

05:12.186 --> 05:14.272
send a homey inside, like,
yo, find an Asian dude,

05:14.355 --> 05:15.732
get his ID for me,
just glance at it,

05:15.815 --> 05:16.566
yep, Asian dude, you're good.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.484
- Does that happen for you too?

05:18.568 --> 05:19.819
- That works for my people too,
yeah.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.279
<i>- But it's not all upside</i>

05:21.362 --> 05:24.073

<i>Think of Errol</i>
<i>as a younger version of me.</i>

05:25.199 --> 05:27.577

05:49.265 --> 05:50.683

<i>Very, very small numbers.</i>

06:01.569 --> 06:04.405
At the end of the day, guys,
we're tokens,

06:04.489 --> 06:06.032
and we gotta stick together.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.742
You know, we're like
the Planeteers.

06:07.825 --> 06:08.826

- Earth.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.411
- Wind.
- Fire.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.746
- Water.
- Heart.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.790
- When our powers combine,
we are...

06:13.873 --> 06:17.376
all: Token Friends!

06:17.460 --> 06:19.295

Let's compare dick size.

uncomfortable at school,

06:44.570 --> 06:48.533
secretary of education
Betsy DeVos felt

06:48.616 --> 06:50.952
when she visited
a historically black college

06:51.035 --> 06:53.704
for the first and I'm gonna go
out on a limb and say...

06:53.788 --> 06:54.789
Last time.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.709
{\an8}- Later today, I will have

Now luckily for y'all,
I have a translation.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.853
{\an8}[students booing]

07:16.936 --> 07:18.354
{\an8}Ms. DeVos, you are
an out-of-touch billionaire

07:18.437 --> 07:20.606
{\an8}who is the enemy
of public education

07:20.690 --> 07:23.693
{\an8}and will make it much harder
for minorities

07:23.776 --> 07:26.112
{\an8}and the disadvantaged
to go to college.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.198
{\an8}And we know you won't do
anything to address the problem

{\an8}of crushing student debt
other than to make it easier

07:31.742 --> 07:34.662

07:34.745 --> 07:35.788

07:39.292 --> 07:42.253

Now there's one college
experience that I've never had.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.683
And no, I'm not talking
about doing mushrooms

07:55.766 --> 07:57.018

07:57.101 --> 08:00.313
I'm talking about being
a big-time college athlete.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.564
Division One.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.940
These athletes,

08:03.024 --> 08:04.859
they put their bodies
on the line for no payment.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.402
Not to mention,
they have to learn

08:06.485 --> 08:08.070
the crazy NCAA rule book,

08:08.154 --> 08:10.573
which basically tells 'em
they can't be given things

08:10.656 --> 08:12.950
normal college students can.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.204

08:44.565 --> 08:46.442
{\an8}- For me?
- Yeah, now how old are you?

08:46.525 --> 08:47.443
{\an8}- 23.
- I think you gotta be

08:47.526 --> 08:50.279
{\an8}older than that
to drive the car,

08:50.363 --> 08:53.824
{\an8}based on their rules,
not NCAA.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.284
{\an8}Just Maserati rules.
- Are you gonna drive me?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.703
{\an8}- I'm gonna chauffeur you, brah.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.833
- You're a senior,
headed towards the draft.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.168
- Yes, sir.
- How are you feeling right now

09:04.252 --> 09:08.130
about this--your whole career
as a college athlete?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.507
- Feeling good, man.
I was All-American this year.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.134
- Okay.
- Everything with the Rose Bowl

09:12.218 --> 09:13.970
victory and everything.
We brought SC back,

09:14.053 --> 09:15.972
put it on the map.
- What was the night like

09:16.055 --> 09:18.140
after that game?
- Oh, insane.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.767
Dudes were jumping off tables
doing crazy stuff?

09:19.850 --> 09:23.187
- So I mean, that's pretty much
what you get paid in.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.814
Is party, and fan love.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.484
Yeah, we get paid in parties
and girls at school.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.361
- Girls at school?
- Yeah.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.696
It's like one of those type of
things, if I told you,

09:31.779 --> 09:33.239
I'd have to kill you
type things.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.574
- Don't stop spilling the tea
now, Zach, it's too late!

09:35.658 --> 09:36.701
{\an8}You already out here
dry snitching.

09:36.784 --> 09:40.454
{\an8}Dry snitching is when you snitch
but kind of.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.498
What's the brokest moment
you've had in college?

09:42.581 --> 09:44.166
- One time during the summer,

09:44.250 --> 09:47.003
I was straight up eatin' Cup of
Noodles for, like, three days.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.296
- Cup of Noodles?
- Cup of Noodles for breakfast,

09:48.379 --> 09:51.132
lunch, and dinner.
- Ugh!

09:51.215 --> 09:52.550
Man, you need to be living life.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.510
You need to be eating
Wagyu steak.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.345
You know what that is?
- No.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.680
{\an8}- That's where they treat
the cow like a king.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.766
{\an8}They massage it.
They--and the cattle

10:00.850 --> 10:04.812
{\an8}watch M. Night Shyamalan
movies and Scorsese flicks.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.939
{\an8}- They cater to the cow.
- They cater to the cow.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.151
{\an8}And then they kill it,
so you got the best meat.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.944
{\an8}- It's like a black woman.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.529
{\an8}- What?
- Yeah.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.114
{\an8}- It's like a black woman.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.157
{\an8}- What?
- Yeah.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.867
- What, 'cause they have
the best meat?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.160
- No, 'cause they cater to them

10:19.243 --> 10:20.703
and they kill you at the end

10:20.786 --> 10:22.621
when they found out you hanging
out with they boyfriends.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.708
- Too many blitzes, [BLEEP].
Too many blitzes.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.671
[scatting]

10:30.755 --> 10:32.173
- They got good food here?

10:32.256 --> 10:33.716
- They got dope food here, man,
that's why we here.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.384
Catch the keys.
- Oh!

10:35.468 --> 10:37.470
I missed--oh, man!

10:40.222 --> 10:42.391
{\an8}- I can't really purchase
your food.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.312
{\an8}Cheers to the rules, right?

10:46.395 --> 10:48.314
Mmm.

10:49.148 --> 10:49.649
Uh-oh.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.152
{\an8}<i>Look at Zach's face</i>

10:53.235 --> 10:54.570
{\an8}<i>staring at that steak.</i>

10:54.653 --> 10:57.531
DJ Khaled and another one.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.077
And another one.
Thank you, man.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.413
So what's your normal day like
as a college athlete?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.333
- Up at 6:00 a.m. for lift.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.919
School starts at 8:30,
get out of class around 2:00.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.589
Meetings are at 3:30
and then practice is at 5:00

11:13.673 --> 11:15.841
and we're done about 8:00.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.259
- Phew. How often
do you skip class?

11:17.343 --> 11:20.388
- Every day.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.515
- Like, not all your classes.
- No.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.849
- But there's...
- You choose.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.434
- Every day there's one class

11:25.518 --> 11:27.353
that you're just not gonna make.
- No.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.271
- If you weren't
as good as you are,

11:29.355 --> 11:31.190
would you have to go to
more classes?

11:31.273 --> 11:34.276
- Yeah, 'cause then you're
supposed to carry the team GPA.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.612
- Uh-huh.
- The average amongst the team.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.697
- So what's the kicker's GPA?

11:38.781 --> 11:41.325
- Well, he's a kicker, so he
doesn't really practice often.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.369
And he's white,
so it's pretty high.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.955
- How does it make you feel,
Zach, to be an athlete

11:46.038 --> 11:48.374
and know that people
are making money off you?

11:48.457 --> 11:51.502
- It's just not fair.
I simply think that

11:51.585 --> 11:53.045
the players should be
compensated.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.296
People from the NCAA,

11:54.380 --> 11:55.756
people from the school,
coaches,

11:55.840 --> 11:56.966
{\an8}everybody's getting paid;

11:57.049 --> 11:58.676
{\an8}<i>why aren't we?</i>

11:58.759 --> 12:01.971
- What I might do,
get this to go, and then go.

12:02.054 --> 12:02.930
And accidentally leave it.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.099
What's the phrase,
finders-keepers?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.601
- That's still illegal.
We can't do that.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.728
- You right, you right.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.689
I now decree this leftovers.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.817
They have no cash value.
Let me say it again.

12:14.900 --> 12:20.030
Fans might be watching.
These are leftovers!

12:20.114 --> 12:22.032
No cash value!

12:22.116 --> 12:23.951
I don't want this shit no more!

12:28.747 --> 12:32.209
By the rules of the NCAA,
you can eat that food, right?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.670
- Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
- Then go to town, man.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.505
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.591
Does it taste like freedom?

12:38.674 --> 12:40.676
- Really good steak.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.720
- Look at you, man,
sitting here,

12:42.803 --> 12:43.596
eating someone else's trash.

12:43.679 --> 12:47.183
How'd it get like this, Zach?

12:47.266 --> 12:50.352
<i>I came, I saw,</i>
<i>and I balled out with Zach.</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:53.022
<i>As much as the NCAA rules</i>
<i>would allow.</i>

12:53.105 --> 12:55.149
- You the man, James.
- You the man too.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.485
[BLEEP] Cup of Noodles.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.198
Hey yo, Zach Banner got drafted

13:02.281 --> 13:03.699
by the Indianapolis Colts,

13:03.782 --> 13:05.576
so if he is eating
Cup of Noodles,

13:05.659 --> 13:08.245
it's in his Tesla,
the one with the Ferrari doors.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.831
Swag.
We'll be back.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.756
{\an8}- Man, we back!

13:18.839 --> 13:20.633
{\an8}Man, we back.
And we back.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.635
{\an8}Okay, we gotta get started.
[record scratches]

13:22.718 --> 13:24.845
College is all about
new experiences.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.222
Top bunk sex.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.765
Breaking into the dining hall
at 3:00 a.m.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.059
for some
jalapeño cheese fries.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.354
Pretending to like Salon
so you can get with that girl

13:33.437 --> 13:35.439
from art history class.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.234
Well, here at "Hood Adjacent,"
we have our own form of college,

13:38.317 --> 13:41.111
and it's called
"Between Two DeRays."

13:41.195 --> 13:44.031
{\an8}Between Two DeRays
continues now.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.783
{\an8}I'm your host,
James Davis,

13:45.866 --> 13:49.787
{\an8}and we are talking about...
College.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.544
Did you go?
- No.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.295
I went to jail.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.547
- Did you?
- Yeah.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.924
- I've been arrested 23 times
since I was 11.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.175
- Been in jail 23 times.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.177
You're the Michael Jordan of
going to jail.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.929
Hey. Okay, did you go
to college?

14:07.012 --> 14:07.930
- I did.
- What school?

14:08.013 --> 14:10.599
- I went to Bowdoin College
in Maine.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.559
- Not a lot of black people
in Maine.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.143
- Not a lot of people in Maine.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.645
It's, like, a million people in
the entire state.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.063
But college was great.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.147
It's the first place
I fell in love with my mind.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.607
I majored in political theory,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.651
so I did a lot with, uh...
- Sorry, James.

14:20.734 --> 14:21.944
You say you fell in love
with his mind,

14:22.027 --> 14:23.404
and that's, like, weird.

14:23.487 --> 14:24.780
- I'm not giving you
a set of books that I think

14:24.863 --> 14:26.282
would be
really powerful for you.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.243
- Is one of them phone books,
would you call some help?

14:29.326 --> 14:30.202
- Do they even make phone books
anymore?

14:30.286 --> 14:31.996
- They do.
- When the last time

14:32.079 --> 14:33.289
you saw a phone book?
- It's been a while.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.748
'Cause I don't be looking
for it.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.542
- Do you want your daughter
to go to school?

14:36.625 --> 14:38.627
- I would hope so, but right
now, the way her grades look,

14:38.711 --> 14:40.671
I rather keep the dough, can't.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.007
- College,
it's fundamentally about

14:43.090 --> 14:45.009
accessing information
and exposure

14:45.092 --> 14:47.386
in ways that you otherwise--
it's hard to recreate.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.805
It can be recreated,
but I think on my own self,

14:49.888 --> 14:50.764
I took classes like
The Secret Life of Lobsters.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.434
I took this class
on the Bible.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.477
{\an8}- Shut up. Bullshit classes.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.021
{\an8}- You took a class on lobsters?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.606
{\an8}- It was about biology
in the sea,

14:58.689 --> 15:00.316
{\an8}but it was called,
The Secret Life of Lobsters.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.484
- Did you know that alligators
eat alligators?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.611
- Do they really?
- Yes.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.988
- Where'd you learn that?
- Nature is scary.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.407
- Where do you get
your information?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.700
- Twitter.
- Where else, though?

15:09.783 --> 15:10.868
- If you had to rank, like,
the top three sources

15:10.951 --> 15:13.537
of information for you?
- Google.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.540
- So Twitter, Google.
- My uncle [indistinct].

15:16.624 --> 15:18.500
- My uncle [indistinct].
- I think certain people

15:18.584 --> 15:20.044
should go to college, like,
you wanna be a doctor,

15:20.127 --> 15:21.253
son, go to college,
'cause I don't want you

15:21.337 --> 15:23.839
working on me
'cause you Googled something.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.007
It's down between the girl
getting the butt shots

15:25.090 --> 15:27.468
in the alley and the girl
going to the doctor

15:27.551 --> 15:29.678
to get the butt shots,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.555
especially if you're coming home
to me.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.057
- Nice.
- Affirmative action.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.476
- It's important.
It's a question of access.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.853
How do we make sure that if
people wanna go to college,

15:37.936 --> 15:39.480
they have a place to go,
and people should have access.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.940
- You sponsored by Access.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.693
You say "Access"
all the time.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.111
- It is about access.
It's a huge thing

15:46.195 --> 15:48.697
When we think about disparities
with regard to race.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.740
- You try throwing me off
with the "disparity" word.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.284
- Would you go back to college--

15:52.368 --> 15:53.702
would you got to college
if you had a chance to now?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.205
- I do have the chance to,
asshole.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.710
- I think DeRay won that debate.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.878
But--but!

16:02.961 --> 16:06.382
DeRay made some good points,
y'all.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.717
But we're not done putting
people's knowledge to the test.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.386
In fact, we're just beginning.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.096
This is...What's Really Hood.

16:13.972 --> 16:16.225
{\an8}So I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.893
{\an8}If you get 'em correct...
- Okay.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.228
{\an8}- We'll keep going
with more questions.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.854
- Okay.
- And the top two finishers

16:20.938 --> 16:23.565
make it to
the championship round.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.275
Are you one of
those top-two finishers?

16:25.359 --> 16:27.069
- We're gonna find out.
- We are.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.113
{\an8}We'll start right now.
- Okay.

16:29.196 --> 16:32.741
{\an8}- Do black people get sunburns?
- Everyone gets sunburns.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.284
{\an8}- That's correct.
- Yeah.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.994
{\an8}- I'm a competitive
Irish dancer.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.497
{\an8}I've been to the world
championships multiple times.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.291
{\an8}<i>[lively Irish music]</i>

16:43.627 --> 16:45.838
{\an8}- How many members are there
in the Wu-Tang Clan?

16:45.921 --> 16:48.132
{\an8}- Three?
- It was ten, y'all.

16:48.215 --> 16:52.678
{\an8}- Name me three members
of the Wu-Tang Clan.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.723
{\an8}If you don't know it,
just start making it up,

16:55.806 --> 16:57.349
{\an8}because that's how rap names
work.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.935
{\an8}- I'm literally blanking.
