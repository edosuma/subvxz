- Thank you.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.721
Thank you.

00:07.721 --> 00:09.890
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:09.891 --> 00:11.992
Now I'm sure like all of you,
I like to start my day

00:11.993 --> 00:14.628
in the same fashion. Wake up,

00:14.629 --> 00:18.332
read the morning paper, have a
nice cold glass of milk.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.275
Now, of course, I make sure

00:28.276 --> 00:31.912
that I never, ever dare...

00:31.913 --> 00:34.715
waste...

00:34.716 --> 00:37.318
a single...

00:37.319 --> 00:40.154
drop.

00:40.155 --> 00:42.890
(GASPS AND APPLAUSE)

00:44.492 --> 00:46.994
- Thank you.
- How dare you do this to me?

00:46.995 --> 00:49.296
- I told you, it's over!
- I don't believe you!

00:49.297 --> 00:50.284
Keep your voices down.

00:50.285 --> 00:52.366
Don't ever tell me
what to do, Merlini.

00:52.367 --> 00:54.393
I'm the headliner,
you're the warm-up act

00:54.394 --> 00:56.303
for the warm-up act. Mind your place.

00:56.304 --> 00:59.273
- Go to hell, you pompous ass.
- Stop it, both of you.

00:59.274 --> 01:01.342
Now,

01:01.343 --> 01:03.677
this...

01:03.678 --> 01:06.180
is a silver dollar.

01:06.181 --> 01:08.649
It is one ounce
of virtually 100% silver.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.626
Feels good in the hand,

01:10.627 --> 01:13.987
but even better in the air.

01:24.299 --> 01:25.999
Thank you.

01:28.737 --> 01:31.105
(APPLAUSE)

01:34.409 --> 01:36.543
- Are you okay?
- She's fine.

01:36.544 --> 01:38.679
I wasn't talking to you.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.348
- Celeste, are you okay?
- Thank you, Winnie,

01:41.349 --> 01:43.817
- but I'm fine.
- Just don't forget to smile.

01:43.818 --> 01:47.054
What a stupendous display

01:47.055 --> 01:50.513
of close-up magic from the
incomparable Ben Sellers

01:50.514 --> 01:53.050
and his assistant Winnie. And now,

01:53.051 --> 01:56.119
gentle friends, we bring to the stage

01:56.120 --> 01:58.488
the man you've all been waiting for,

01:58.489 --> 02:02.125
a man so imbued with mystical powers

02:02.126 --> 02:05.896
he could beat the very Devil
himself in a contest of conjuring!

02:05.897 --> 02:08.264
A man who will be known

02:08.265 --> 02:11.601
as the greatest magician
of his time...

02:11.602 --> 02:14.838
Please welcome to the stage

02:14.839 --> 02:17.908
a modern maven of the Grand
Illusion...

02:17.909 --> 02:20.043
The Great Van Zant!

02:20.044 --> 02:22.379
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

02:27.652 --> 02:30.287
Thanks first to Merlini and Sellers

02:30.288 --> 02:32.522
for warming up for me tonight.

02:32.523 --> 02:35.392
I promise your evening

02:35.393 --> 02:37.861
is about to get a lot more... magical.

02:53.778 --> 02:55.979
it's time for our final trick
of the evening.

02:55.980 --> 02:59.616
The most deadly of all
my grand illusions.

02:59.617 --> 03:03.086
I bring you... the Flaming Swords!

03:03.087 --> 03:05.088
Once I have bound

03:05.089 --> 03:07.657
my wife's wrists together,

03:07.658 --> 03:11.161
I will seal her away
in this cabinet...

03:13.231 --> 03:16.499
...where she will have
minutes to escape

03:16.501 --> 03:19.202
a calamitous, catastrophic,

03:19.203 --> 03:21.871
cataclysmic doom.

03:21.873 --> 03:24.474
My love,

03:24.475 --> 03:26.628
are you sure I can't
talk you out of this?

03:26.629 --> 03:27.823
I am sure, my love.

03:29.714 --> 03:32.782
Then let the Gods of Magic
smile upon her!

So what happened?

05:03.507 --> 05:06.242
Without revealing any secrets,

05:06.244 --> 05:08.244
I'll say a technical issue

05:08.246 --> 05:10.747
caused Celeste to become
trapped inside the cabinet.

05:10.748 --> 05:12.816
The Great Van Zant had no idea.

05:12.817 --> 05:14.818
What have the police said about it?

05:14.819 --> 05:16.886
It's only been a few days,

05:16.887 --> 05:18.655
so they've yet to make
a determination.

05:18.656 --> 05:21.624
Ongoing investigation, et
cetera. But in the meantime,

05:21.626 --> 05:23.626
they've released Van Zant, thank God,

05:23.628 --> 05:26.062
and he's back at work
inventing a new finale.

05:26.063 --> 05:29.432
- How can we help?
- If I let you inside

05:29.433 --> 05:33.503
my circle of trust, you must
promise to keep everything I say

05:33.504 --> 05:36.072
absolutely secret.

05:36.073 --> 05:38.375
Well, we are known for our discretion.

05:38.376 --> 05:41.745
So I've heard.

05:41.746 --> 05:46.082
I am plagued by a most horrid
suspicion about Celeste's death.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.518
You think foul play was involved?

05:48.519 --> 05:51.488
I don't know. But if there was
some form of chicanery involved,

05:51.489 --> 05:53.023
it would take a magician
to pull it off.

05:53.024 --> 05:54.691
Did you tell the police your theory?

05:54.692 --> 05:56.659
Yes, but to no avail.

05:56.661 --> 05:59.062
I have no proof and the
detective has no imagination.

05:59.063 --> 06:01.331
Let me guess. Detective Greyson.

06:01.332 --> 06:04.834
- Smith. Why do you ask?
- It's not important.

06:04.835 --> 06:06.836
We'll take the case,

06:06.837 --> 06:08.905
but we're gonna have to get
close to the magicians

06:08.906 --> 06:12.275
in question. Get inside
their "circle of trust."

06:12.276 --> 06:15.845
- What do you propose?
- Van Zant needs a new assistant.

06:15.846 --> 06:18.047
You know what happened
to the last one, right?

06:18.049 --> 06:20.617
It will never work, Miss Drake.

06:20.618 --> 06:22.519
You need to know the craft of magic,

06:22.520 --> 06:24.421
and you need to have very fast hands.

06:24.422 --> 06:28.391
Well, I don't know a lot
about magic. But...

06:28.392 --> 06:31.394
I am a quick study. And...

06:32.897 --> 06:34.864
Your watch.

06:36.367 --> 06:38.935
Quick hands. When can you start?

06:38.936 --> 06:42.372
Right away. Why don't you
check in with Flo,

06:42.373 --> 06:45.742
see if she can look at Celeste's
body and find anything unusual.

06:45.743 --> 06:48.545
- Will do.
- Since I'm going undercover,

06:48.546 --> 06:51.214
you will be in charge
of the investigation.

06:51.215 --> 06:54.250
So I'll be the boss. It's about time.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.121
Welcome to the Magic Mansion.

06:58.122 --> 07:00.657
By day, a social club
for magicians. By night,

07:00.658 --> 07:03.526
a magical cabaret.
The first of its kind.

07:03.527 --> 07:06.463
I've always wanted to visit.
But it's better than I imagined.

07:06.464 --> 07:09.566
Five years ago, I set out
to create a place where Magi

07:09.567 --> 07:12.302
could share their ideas
and further their craft.

07:12.303 --> 07:15.905
But jealousy and infighting
corrupted my utopia.

07:15.906 --> 07:18.341
Well, the road to hell is
paved with good intentions.

07:18.342 --> 07:20.844
Indeed. I chose three magicians

07:20.845 --> 07:22.912
to highlight the three
schools of magic.

07:22.913 --> 07:25.748
Merlini, the mystical mesmerist.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.544
Sellers, the dashing
close-up artist, whose

07:27.545 --> 07:29.252
hands are always
quicker than your eye.

07:29.253 --> 07:32.322
And of course, the modern maven

07:32.323 --> 07:35.458
of the Grand Illusion,
The Great Van Zant.

07:35.459 --> 07:38.661
Gee, I wonder
which one's the headliner.

07:38.662 --> 07:42.332
He insisted his poster be
twice as large.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.734
What I don't understand
is if Celeste knew

07:44.735 --> 07:46.803
the trick was going wrong,
why didn't she call out to him?

07:46.804 --> 07:48.268
The music was at a crescendo, and

07:48.269 --> 07:49.973
the cabinet is virtually sound-proof.

07:49.974 --> 07:52.041
So if she did call out...

07:52.042 --> 07:55.111
No one heard her cries. Poor thing.

07:55.112 --> 07:57.780
- Did Celeste have any enemies?
- None that I know of.

07:57.782 --> 07:58.870
So who'd want to kill her?

07:58.871 --> 08:01.317
I can't think of anyone
who'd want to harm Celeste.

08:01.318 --> 08:04.487
I wish I could say the same
of her husband.

08:04.488 --> 08:06.356
Van Zant has enemies?

08:06.357 --> 08:08.892
One doesn't reach the summit
of one's profession

08:08.893 --> 08:12.128
without incurring the jealous
wrath of lesser rivals.

08:12.129 --> 08:14.931
Is it possible this has
more to do with the ending

08:14.932 --> 08:17.233
of Van Zant's career
than killing Celeste?

08:17.234 --> 08:19.936
More than possible, my dear.

08:19.937 --> 08:22.005
Magic is a cutthroat world.

08:22.006 --> 08:24.007
Who has access to the cabinet?

08:24.008 --> 08:27.143
The backstage is
a closely guarded space.

08:27.144 --> 08:30.146
The only people with access
are myself, the two assistants,

08:30.147 --> 08:32.248
The Great Van Zant,
Merlini and Sellers.

08:32.249 --> 08:34.517
I'll need to speak with each of them.

08:34.518 --> 08:36.376
There's no need to speak to Van Zant.

08:36.376 --> 08:37.986
I assure you he is not to blame.

08:37.988 --> 08:40.924
Well, that remains to be seen.

08:40.924 --> 08:43.458
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

08:45.496 --> 08:48.264
If I wanted an escape artist,
I'd book Houdini.

08:48.265 --> 08:50.400
The Flaming Swords is finished.

08:50.401 --> 08:52.835
I'm trying to come up
with ideas for a new finale.

08:52.837 --> 08:54.671
Who's she?

08:54.672 --> 08:56.539
Your new assistant. Emily Blake.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.075
Don't tell me you hired someone
without even talking to me.

08:59.076 --> 09:01.578
I didn't want to overburden
you, dear boy.

09:01.579 --> 09:03.947
And I know Celeste is irreplaceable,

09:03.948 --> 09:06.349
but she would want us
to carry on into the future.

09:06.350 --> 09:08.236
The future? So what happens if the

09:08.237 --> 09:10.353
police decide to come and lock me up?

09:10.354 --> 09:13.022
Have faith, Van Zant.

09:13.023 --> 09:15.124
They'll determine
your innocence post-haste,

09:15.125 --> 09:17.961
but we must be ready
to resume performances.

09:17.962 --> 09:21.264
I'll allow you two to get acquainted.

09:21.265 --> 09:24.033
You're pretty enough.

09:24.034 --> 09:26.869
Thank you. I think.

09:27.972 --> 09:30.173
Let me get these chains
out of the way for you.

09:32.042 --> 09:34.177
You know, I just finished
a six-month stint

09:34.178 --> 09:36.145
assisting the Great Thomson in London.

09:36.146 --> 09:38.615
Never heard of him.

09:38.616 --> 09:40.817
He's incredible. He taught me so much.

09:40.818 --> 09:44.387
Hm. And what pearls of wisdom did
the Great Thomson share with you?

09:44.388 --> 09:47.557
The cardinal rule of magic.
Every single illusion

09:47.558 --> 09:50.627
- is based on one simple principle.
- And what is that?

09:50.628 --> 09:53.696
Misdirection.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.779
Well played.

09:57.780 --> 10:00.230
- (KNOCK)
- Hope I'm not interrupting.

10:00.231 --> 10:03.072
- How can we help you, Miss...
- Trudy Clarke. I'm a PI.

10:03.073 --> 10:05.265
I was hired by Oswald to
look into the incident.

10:05.266 --> 10:07.055
I'll need to speak with Mr. Van Zant.

10:11.015 --> 10:13.783
Don't touch anything.

10:17.688 --> 10:20.189
Wanted to introduce myself.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.525
I'm Winnie Hudson.
I assist Mr. Sellers.

10:22.526 --> 10:25.662
- Pleasure to meet you. Emily.
- I see you've met Van Zant.

10:25.663 --> 10:28.297
He can be a bit... what's the word?

10:28.299 --> 10:30.800
- Prickly?
- That's it. Prickly.

10:30.801 --> 10:33.603
I suppose it's understandable,
just having lost his wife.

10:33.604 --> 10:35.638
Sure.

10:35.639 --> 10:37.907
You don't sound so sure.

10:39.376 --> 10:42.478
You can tell me.
Assistant to assistant.

10:43.747 --> 10:45.815
Van Zant could be
awfully mean to Celeste.

10:45.816 --> 10:48.451
He was yelling at her that night
before going on stage,

10:48.452 --> 10:50.486
- and I mean yelling.
- You don't think...

10:50.487 --> 10:54.257
- Morning, Winnie!
- Oh! Morning, Ollie.

10:54.258 --> 10:55.389
Oh, keeping busy, I see.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.539
You know what they
say about idle hands.

11:00.397 --> 11:02.965
- Just watch yourself, honey.
- Thanks for the tip.

11:07.404 --> 11:09.706
Are you asking
if I tried to kill Celeste?

11:09.707 --> 11:11.574
I'm just trying to figure out
what happened.

11:11.575 --> 11:14.077
What kind of magician would
intentionally kill his assistant

11:14.078 --> 11:15.238
in front of a packed house?

11:15.239 --> 11:18.047
Interesting that you call her
your assistant, not your wife.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.683
Can we speed this along? I have
a new finale to come up with.

11:20.684 --> 11:22.885
Did you check the equipment
before you went on stage?

11:22.886 --> 11:25.755
No, that was Celeste's job.
She handled all of that.

11:25.756 --> 11:26.978
So she should have
noticed something was

11:26.979 --> 11:28.191
wrong with the cabinet.
Why didn't she?

11:28.192 --> 11:30.727
I don't know. I honestly don't.

11:30.728 --> 11:32.862
Do you know of anyone else who
would've tampered with the cabinet?

11:32.863 --> 11:35.431
I can think of a couple.
One's named Sellers,

11:35.432 --> 11:38.234
the other's Merlini.

11:38.235 --> 11:40.069
Celeste was everything
you'd want in an assistant.

11:40.070 --> 11:43.106
Beautiful, of course. Fast hands.

11:43.107 --> 11:46.943
Fluent with stagecraft. Infinitely
smarter than her husband.

11:46.944 --> 11:50.546
- You're not a fan of his.
- Besides Van Zant's obvious failings

11:50.547 --> 11:53.616
as a magician,
he's even worse as a man.

11:53.617 --> 11:56.219
I don't respect him,
but I don't resent him.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.287
Why don't you respect him?

11:58.288 --> 11:59.597
The magicians I
respect, like Thurston or

11:59.598 --> 12:00.923
Blackstone, they invent
their own tricks.

12:00.924 --> 12:02.592
And Van Zant doesn't?

12:02.593 --> 12:05.228
Some of the simpler tricks, sure.

12:05.229 --> 12:07.230
But the one that made his career...?

12:07.231 --> 12:08.177
The Flaming Swords?

12:08.178 --> 12:11.067
Despite what he claims, I'm
positive he didn't invent it.

12:11.068 --> 12:13.436
The design, the build, it's...

12:13.437 --> 12:15.972
far too complex for Van Zant.

12:15.973 --> 12:18.374
Well, if he didn't, who did?

12:18.375 --> 12:22.311
I've heard whispers
about a kind of black market

12:22.312 --> 12:24.814
for tricks. Apparently
there's this "mystery man"...

12:24.815 --> 12:28.351
- I guess he's a kind of broker.
- What's his name?

12:28.352 --> 12:30.753
Frost. That's all I know about him.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.627
Let's move quickly, Mary.
I don't want the coroner

12:37.628 --> 12:40.263
finding us sneaking a peek
at our most famous resident.

12:40.264 --> 12:42.498
Trudy said we had to look
for anything... unusual.

12:42.499 --> 12:44.667
How about getting killed
by two flaming swords?

12:44.668 --> 12:47.637
- That's pretty unusual.
- Poor girl. What a way to go.

12:47.638 --> 12:48.860
She was just doing her job.

12:48.861 --> 12:51.007
Okay, this is unusual.
Look at her wrists.

12:51.008 --> 12:53.876
They were bound with ropes,
and no apparent tissue damage.

12:53.877 --> 12:55.978
If you were trapped in a cabinet
and knew you were about to die...

12:55.979 --> 12:57.476
You'd struggle like the dickens to

12:57.477 --> 12:59.060
get out. So where's the rope burn?

13:00.350 --> 13:02.285
Mind if I come in?

13:03.654 --> 13:06.856
- Who are you?
- Detective Greyson.

13:06.857 --> 13:10.560
- And you are...?
- Emily Blake.

13:10.561 --> 13:12.012
Emily Blake. You know, I could swear

13:12.013 --> 13:13.463
that we've seen each other before.

13:13.464 --> 13:16.165
I would remember a face like yours.

13:16.166 --> 13:19.368
- I will take that as a compliment.
- Where's Detective Smith?

13:19.369 --> 13:22.839
Gout. Real nasty case.
I'm taking over for him.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.649
My condolences for your loss.
I'm gonna

13:24.650 --> 13:26.309
need to see the magical apparatus.

13:26.310 --> 13:28.711
There is such a thing as
the magician's code of secrecy.

13:28.712 --> 13:32.381
Yes. My badge trumps your code.

13:32.382 --> 13:35.818
- Shall I come along?
- No, stay here. Don't touch anything.

13:37.087 --> 13:40.423
Yes, stay here. Don't touch anything.

13:40.424 --> 13:42.391
(HE CHUCKLES.)

13:42.392 --> 13:45.962
The apparatus hasn't been moved
since the accident?

13:45.963 --> 13:48.831
Detective Smith ordered us
to keep the cabaret locked.

13:48.832 --> 13:52.034
I can promise you
no one's been in or out.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.237
Okay.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.415
Okay.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.517
Show me how it works.
I'll be your assistant.

14:09.853 --> 14:11.954
First, I tie your wrists with rope.

14:11.955 --> 14:15.057
- Then I lead you inside the cabinet.
- Okay.

14:16.994 --> 14:19.562
The trick is when I close
the door, it releases

14:19.563 --> 14:21.933
a gear system below which
should open the trap door.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.132
Except it didn't open.

14:23.133 --> 14:25.935
Due to mechanical failure.

14:25.936 --> 14:28.604
So why is it open now?

14:28.605 --> 14:30.661
Detective Smith used
a crowbar so he could

14:30.662 --> 14:32.475
take a look down below the apparatus.

14:32.476 --> 14:34.810
I'm gonna need to take
a look down there.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.519
So under normal circumstances,

14:43.520 --> 14:45.392
the trap door would open and Celeste

14:45.393 --> 14:47.390
would jump down. What happens next?

14:47.391 --> 14:50.059
She would use that blade

14:50.060 --> 14:53.129
on the table there to cut
through the rope on her wrists.

14:53.130 --> 14:55.331
And then she would run
through that tunnel there,

14:55.332 --> 14:57.800
under the stage, and pop up
behind the audience

14:57.801 --> 14:59.802
for the reveal.

14:59.803 --> 15:03.272
Practical design. You got
a background in mechanics?

15:03.273 --> 15:06.676
- No, I have a background in magic.
- Yes, I suppose you would.

15:10.781 --> 15:13.649
So these are the gears in question.

15:13.650 --> 15:16.118
Any idea why they would've
stopped working?

15:16.119 --> 15:18.321
Wear and tear, I suppose.

15:18.322 --> 15:20.323
We've done the trick
hundreds of times.

15:20.324 --> 15:23.626
There's no backup, in case
the trick malfunctions?

15:23.627 --> 15:25.995
There is a way for Celeste
to open the door from inside.

15:25.996 --> 15:29.165
- So why didn't she?
- I don't know.

15:29.166 --> 15:32.301
You know, Van Zant, there's
a lot of things you don't know.

15:32.302 --> 15:33.984
I would expect that a
husband would be a

15:33.985 --> 15:35.917
little more curious about
why his wife died.

15:38.308 --> 15:41.477
There's scoring here on the gears.

15:41.478 --> 15:44.447
And fine metallic dust... Looks to me

15:44.448 --> 15:47.049
like something metallic
was jammed right in here.

15:47.050 --> 15:49.652
- This was sabotage.
- I had nothing to do with that.

15:49.653 --> 15:51.854
I bet you didn't.

16:08.205 --> 16:12.141
Gears broke with force, so
the object must have flown...

16:15.212 --> 16:18.180
...somewhere over here.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.690
(UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC)

16:37.943 --> 16:41.712
So that's what the saboteur used
to jam the gears and kill Celeste?

16:41.713 --> 16:43.914
- How come the cops didn't find it?
- Good question.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.183
I think it flew clear
when the gears jammed.

16:46.184 --> 16:48.786
Carson City Morgan silver dollar.

16:48.787 --> 16:52.222
- That's the same coin Sellers uses.
- So is he our saboteur?

16:52.224 --> 16:53.815
Not the smartest move, using your

16:53.816 --> 16:55.526
signature coin to commit a murder.

16:55.527 --> 16:58.929
Bet he didn't expect anyone
to find it down there.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.864
Let me talk to Sellers,
see what I can find out.

17:00.865 --> 17:02.391
I'll talk to Winnie. If Sellers was

17:02.392 --> 17:04.401
planning something, maybe
she knows about it.

17:04.402 --> 17:07.104
Did you guys find anything
on Celeste's body?

17:07.105 --> 17:10.973
Seems like she didn't struggle
with her ropes much. Strange, right?

17:10.976 --> 17:12.363
Merlini told me that Van Zant was

17:12.364 --> 17:13.944
shouting at her before they went on.

17:13.944 --> 17:17.047
- That's no way to treat to your wife.
- Actually, he refers to Celeste

17:17.048 --> 17:20.550
- as his assistant, not his wife.
- Sounds like a close marriage.

17:20.551 --> 17:23.420
At this point, I don't think
we can rule anyone out.

17:23.421 --> 17:25.422
Speaking of magic tricks,

17:25.423 --> 17:28.046
there's a bit of a mystery
surrounding who invented it.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.159
It wasn't Van Zant?

17:29.160 --> 17:32.129
Sellers doesn't believe so. He
thinks that Van Zant bought it

17:32.130 --> 17:34.932
from a mysterious "broker" for
magic tricks named Mr. Frost.

17:34.933 --> 17:37.634
- He sounds very shady.
- Apparently he keeps

17:37.636 --> 17:39.599
a very low profile. But
I was able to twist

17:39.600 --> 17:41.639
Oswald's arm to arrange
a meeting with him.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.459
Why don't you two go talk to this

17:43.460 --> 17:45.509
Frost and see what you can find out?

17:45.510 --> 17:48.445
A top secret mission. I can't wait.

17:50.849 --> 17:52.983
Recognise this?

17:52.984 --> 17:55.486
Well, let me see.

17:55.487 --> 17:58.789
That is a Carson City Morgan
silver dollar. My signature.

17:58.790 --> 18:01.992
What if I said it was used
to sabotage the Flaming Swords?

18:03.728 --> 18:05.710
Anyone who knows what
they're doing could

18:05.711 --> 18:07.498
use this coin to jam it in the gears.

18:07.499 --> 18:10.300
Who said anything about gears?

18:10.302 --> 18:13.270
Look. See the scoring

18:13.271 --> 18:15.873
along the edges? Clearly it was
jammed into something metallic.

18:15.874 --> 18:18.108
- I just took a guess.
- A lucky guess.

18:18.109 --> 18:21.412
Okay. Watch this. Ready?

18:24.549 --> 18:27.651
- Where'd it go?
- Check your purse.

18:32.624 --> 18:35.192
- How did you do that?
- Magic.

18:35.193 --> 18:37.995
Now, if I can make that coin
appear and disappear

18:37.996 --> 18:41.298
at will, why would I leave it
in some incriminating place?

18:44.836 --> 18:47.471
- Who is it?
- Emily. Your assistant.

18:47.472 --> 18:50.274
Go away! I'm inventing!

18:52.243 --> 18:55.312
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- You did warn me.

18:55.313 --> 18:58.449
You're so lucky, working for Mr.
Sellers. I bet he never yells at you.

18:58.450 --> 19:01.485
Never. No, he's a real gem, I tell ya.

19:01.486 --> 19:04.021
- Does he ever get jealous?
- Of who?

19:04.022 --> 19:07.691
Mr. Van Zant, of course. Must
be hard working in his shadow.

19:09.594 --> 19:12.696
I'll tell ya, Mr. Sellers
was set to be the headliner

19:12.697 --> 19:15.299
before Van Zant showed up with
this "Flaming Swords" business.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.668
That must have made him pretty upset.

19:17.669 --> 19:20.404
Well, sure. Not that he talks
about it. He's a bit...

19:20.405 --> 19:22.639
- what's the word?
- Secretive.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.676
That's it. Secretive. Real secretive.

19:25.677 --> 19:27.945
You think he has something to hide?

19:27.946 --> 19:30.814
Honey, everyone at the Magic
Mansion has something to hide.

19:38.022 --> 19:40.023
Mary, what's wrong?

19:40.024 --> 19:42.092
Nothing's wrong, Flo. Why do you ask?

19:42.093 --> 19:44.461
You haven't made a peep
in almost 15 minutes,

19:44.462 --> 19:47.130
and that's an eternity in Mary time.

19:48.299 --> 19:51.034
Alright, don't make fun...
I'm just a bit scared.

19:51.035 --> 19:54.004
Ah, well, don't let
a little fog throw ya.

19:54.005 --> 19:56.039
No, it's not that, it's...

19:56.040 --> 19:57.783
Alright, it goes back to Harriet Sim's

19:57.784 --> 19:59.510
birthday party in the third grade.

19:59.511 --> 20:01.745
Her parents, they hired a magician

20:01.746 --> 20:03.523
and he made this rabbit disappear, but

20:03.524 --> 20:05.282
then he couldn't make it reappear.

20:05.283 --> 20:08.552
- What happened to the rabbit?
- It got away

20:08.553 --> 20:10.126
and ran out into the
street where it was

20:10.127 --> 20:11.889
crushed under the wheels
of a passing cart.

20:11.890 --> 20:14.191
Ever since then I haven't been able

20:14.192 --> 20:16.260
to look at a magician
without feeling scared.

20:16.261 --> 20:19.763
Well, here's your opportunity
to get over your magic phobia.

20:19.764 --> 20:20.625
This is it?

20:20.626 --> 20:22.566
Yeah, here we are.
It's the right address.

20:22.567 --> 20:25.202
But Flo, there's no sign
or name on the door.

20:25.203 --> 20:28.238
- This feels sinister.
- Oh, it'll be fine.

20:29.641 --> 20:33.343
The bell is silent. Strange! (GASPING)

20:33.344 --> 20:36.480
Ha, ha, ha! C'mon, scaredy-cat.

20:36.481 --> 20:39.550
Ooh, it doesn't want
to let us in! Ha, ha!

20:42.287 --> 20:44.955
See, Mary? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

20:44.956 --> 20:48.425
No, Flo, there are a few
things. Where should I begin?

20:48.426 --> 20:51.662
- What is this thing?
- Good afternoon.

20:51.663 --> 20:54.765
(GASPING AND LAUGHING)

20:54.766 --> 20:57.401
- Who are you?
- Flo Chakowitz.

20:57.402 --> 21:00.037
This is Mary Shaw. We're
with Drake Private Detectives.

21:00.038 --> 21:03.607
- Are you Mr. Frost, by any chance?
- Yes, I am.

21:03.608 --> 21:07.177
And you must be the two ladies
that Oswald told me about.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.479
How may I help you?

21:09.481 --> 21:12.149
We heard you know something
about The Flaming Swords.

21:12.150 --> 21:14.384
What of it?

21:14.385 --> 21:16.820
We heard that you may have
sold it to the Great Van Zant?

21:16.821 --> 21:19.022
Do I look to you

21:19.023 --> 21:21.858
like the proprietor
of your local magic shop?

21:21.860 --> 21:24.394
- No?
- I do not

21:24.395 --> 21:27.030
"sell" magic tricks.

21:27.031 --> 21:30.334
I'm a middleman between the
magician and the inventor.

21:30.335 --> 21:34.504
Some people would call me a broker;
I prefer the word "facilitator."

21:34.506 --> 21:36.974
But of course, in order
to be good at my business,

21:36.975 --> 21:40.177
I'm also a practitioner of the craft.

21:40.178 --> 21:41.745
(GASPING)

21:48.219 --> 21:50.854
And it means I know a good trick

21:50.855 --> 21:53.123
when I see one.

21:53.124 --> 21:56.226
And The Flaming Swords
is a very good trick.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.763
The sort of trick that any
magician would sell his soul for.

21:59.764 --> 22:01.624
So did you "facilitate" the sale

22:01.625 --> 22:03.667
of The Flaming Swords to Van Zant?

22:03.668 --> 22:06.570
No, I was not involved
with The Flaming Swords.

22:06.571 --> 22:09.773
That was created by Van Zant alone.

22:09.774 --> 22:13.443
He is an unparalleled genius of magic.

22:13.444 --> 22:16.913
- Sounds like you know him well.
- No, I never met him.

22:16.915 --> 22:19.583
But I understand
he is a wonderful man,

22:19.584 --> 22:21.852
and so dedicated to that
beautiful wife of his.

22:21.853 --> 22:23.954
God rest her soul.

22:25.290 --> 22:27.591
And now if you'll excuse us?

22:27.592 --> 22:31.428
I have other business to attend to.

22:31.429 --> 22:33.964
- Flo, we've gotta help that rabbit.
- No, it'll be fine.

22:33.965 --> 22:36.366
Let's get out of here.

22:41.139 --> 22:43.240
- Have you seen, Sellers?
- At the bar.

22:43.241 --> 22:45.375
Thank you.

22:45.376 --> 22:47.511
What on earth is this hideous thing?

22:47.512 --> 22:49.279
It's called "Mesmer's Ring."

22:49.280 --> 22:52.282
I thought you could use it
in your act. See?

22:52.283 --> 22:54.284
I'm a mentalist, Oswald.
I don't need props.

22:54.285 --> 22:57.054
Let me show you just how easily
I can mesmerize you.

22:57.055 --> 23:00.057
No, no, last time I let you do
that, I ended up giving you a raise.

23:01.793 --> 23:04.261
Perhaps our new assistant

23:04.262 --> 23:06.066
would like a demonstration
of mesmerism.

23:06.067 --> 23:07.464
Well, perhaps another time,

23:07.465 --> 23:09.733
- Mr. Merlini.
- As you wish, mademoiselle.

23:11.269 --> 23:14.071
Uh, Merlini, you're sure
I can't convince you

23:14.072 --> 23:16.840
- just to give this a try?
- Wow.

23:16.841 --> 23:19.509
Impressive. What's your secret?

23:19.510 --> 23:22.145
What kind of magician would I
be if I shared my secrets?

23:22.146 --> 23:24.147
Even with such a beautiful woman.

23:24.148 --> 23:26.983
- We haven't met. I'm Ben Sellers.
- Emily Blake.

23:26.985 --> 23:29.986
It's a pleasure.

23:29.988 --> 23:32.923
You're Van Zant's new assistant. I
trust you're settling in alright?

23:32.924 --> 23:34.927
Well, I haven't seen much of him. He's

23:34.928 --> 23:36.860
been busy inventing his newest trick.

23:36.861 --> 23:39.296
Ah. Well, wish him luck.

23:39.297 --> 23:41.832
You know, Winnie told me

23:41.833 --> 23:45.135
that you were set to headline the
show before Van Zant came along.

23:45.136 --> 23:48.238
- That must've stung a bit.
- I suppose.

23:48.239 --> 23:51.274
- Why do you ask?
- I'm just curious is all.

23:52.810 --> 23:56.046
Do you mind if I ask you
something a bit personal, Ben?

23:56.047 --> 23:57.814
Of course.

23:57.815 --> 24:01.318
Well, Van Zant hasn't exactly
welcomed me with open arms.

24:01.319 --> 24:04.821
He's been downright rude,
to be honest.

24:04.822 --> 24:06.857
I'm sure he wasn't that way
with his wife...

24:06.858 --> 24:09.893
- I wouldn't be so sure about that.
- See, that's just it.

24:09.894 --> 24:12.395
I heard that the two of them
were arguing

24:12.397 --> 24:14.171
right before they went
on stage that night.

24:14.172 --> 24:15.499
Do you know what it was about?

24:15.500 --> 24:17.101
Well, that night I did hear her say

24:17.102 --> 24:19.036
something along the
lines of "it's over."

24:19.037 --> 24:21.571
Poor Celeste, she was so upset.

24:21.572 --> 24:25.142
You know, Winnie and I tried to
cheer her up, but... Are you okay?

24:25.143 --> 24:28.111
- She's fine.
- I wasn't talking to you.

24:29.414 --> 24:31.815
- Celeste, are you okay?
- Thank you, Winnie,

24:31.816 --> 24:34.351
- but I'm fine.
- Just don't forget to smile.

24:35.420 --> 24:37.287
It didn't help.

24:37.288 --> 24:40.657
She just was so glum on stage,
you know? Just blank.

24:40.658 --> 24:43.160
Just like... just not herself.

24:44.162 --> 24:46.296
You know, enough about that.

24:46.297 --> 24:49.499
Why don't I pour us a couple
of cocktails, whaddaya say?

24:49.500 --> 24:52.002
Oh, uh... Rain check?

24:52.003 --> 24:54.237
Tell you what. I'll do
even better than that.

24:54.238 --> 24:56.740
- I'd love to take you out for dinner.
- It's a date.

24:56.741 --> 24:59.509
- Alright.
- Just the man I'm looking for.

24:59.510 --> 25:01.378
Ben Sellers.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.680
Detective Greyson. I'm
investigating the death

25:03.681 --> 25:05.749
of Celeste Van Zant.

25:05.750 --> 25:08.652
I'd like you to come with me,
ask you a few questions.

25:08.653 --> 25:11.688
Well, I... had nothing to do with it.

25:11.689 --> 25:14.558
Good to hear. Get your things.

25:19.797 --> 25:22.299
You two looked awful cozy.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.301
What do you have on Sellers?

25:24.302 --> 25:27.437
I went back to see the
apparatus. Based on the scoring

25:27.438 --> 25:29.372
and the fine silver
metallic dust, I would say

25:29.373 --> 25:32.375
that the gears were jammed
with one of these.

25:35.947 --> 25:38.381
A Carson City Morgan silver dollar.

25:38.382 --> 25:40.083
Sellers' signature.

25:40.084 --> 25:42.118
Isn't it a possibility

25:42.120 --> 25:44.454
that the culprit used this
as a bit of misdirection?

25:44.455 --> 25:46.423
It's possible.

25:46.424 --> 25:48.291
A good investigator
runs down all his leads.

25:48.292 --> 25:51.661
- It's a bit obvious.
- You know, Drake,

25:51.662 --> 25:54.297
you don't have to make things
so complicated.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.385
Sometimes the answer you're looking

25:57.386 --> 25:59.181
for is right in front of your nose.

26:01.672 --> 26:03.506
Thanks for the tip.

26:03.508 --> 26:06.076
Anytime.

26:06.077 --> 26:09.145
Alright, Sellers, let's go.

26:12.283 --> 26:14.618
Greyson brought him in
for questioning?

26:14.619 --> 26:16.207
I think he's barking
up the wrong tree.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.552
Me too. Think he got the wrong guy.

26:17.553 --> 26:20.023
Mary, how did you and Flo
make out with Frost?

26:20.024 --> 26:22.959
He's a suspicious character
if I ever met one.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.429
Did he mention anything about
selling the trick to Van Zant?

26:26.430 --> 26:28.144
Frost said he had
nothing to do with The

26:28.145 --> 26:29.933
Flaming Swords. According
to him, Van Zant

26:29.934 --> 26:32.702
is a wonderful man, a magic genius

26:32.703 --> 26:34.671
- and a devoted husband.
- Clearly he doesn't know Van Zant.

26:34.672 --> 26:36.464
Strangely enough,
that's what Frost said.

26:36.465 --> 26:38.041
Apparently, they've never even met.

26:38.042 --> 26:41.177
Sellers confirmed that Celeste
was acting out of character

26:41.179 --> 26:43.980
- that night.
- Can't blame her with that marriage.

26:43.981 --> 26:45.715
Let's go check with Flo.

26:45.716 --> 26:47.884
Narcotics? Cocaine? Morphine?

26:47.885 --> 26:50.787
- Nope. Clean as a whistle.
- But her behaviour was so odd.

26:50.788 --> 26:52.374
Why didn't she struggle
with the ropes?

26:52.375 --> 26:53.523
Or just open the cabinet

26:53.524 --> 26:55.525
from the inside.
It just doesn't add up.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.560
Maybe she was under
the influence of something.

26:57.562 --> 26:59.696
How do you mean?

26:59.697 --> 27:01.699
Maybe she was hypnotised.

27:05.702 --> 27:07.803
So the killer sabotaged the trick

27:07.805 --> 27:09.805
to trap Celeste inside the cabinet.

27:09.807 --> 27:12.475
But they needed to make sure
that she would be compliant,

27:12.476 --> 27:14.911
so hypnosis is the perfect solution.

27:14.912 --> 27:17.446
I always thought hypnosis
was just some parlour trick.

27:17.448 --> 27:19.649
Me too, but clearly
we need to know more.

27:19.650 --> 27:22.018
I'll talk to Oswald, he's
an expert in all things magic.

27:22.019 --> 27:24.220
I think it's time
to investigated Merlini,

27:24.221 --> 27:27.056
the Mansion's resident
hypnotist. I'll do some digging.

27:27.057 --> 27:30.293
Frankie, one of the gals
at the station

27:30.294 --> 27:32.828
was hypnotised by Merlini
at the Magic Mansion

27:32.830 --> 27:35.898
and she said he made her bark like
a chicken and cluck like a dog.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.936
Just please be careful.

27:39.937 --> 27:42.004
I'll keep my wits about me.

27:42.005 --> 27:44.774
(UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC)

28:09.333 --> 28:12.034
Love letters.

28:25.349 --> 28:27.583
It was Celeste.

28:27.584 --> 28:29.752
Well, Merlini is one
of the best hypnotists

28:29.753 --> 28:32.054
in the world. If anyone could
pull it off, it would be him.

28:32.055 --> 28:33.789
But how does it work exactly?

28:33.790 --> 28:35.791
Hm. It would require

28:35.792 --> 28:37.860
a few sessions, to give her
instructions to follow.

28:37.861 --> 28:40.129
Then, at the right time,

28:40.130 --> 28:43.566
he'd cue her and she'd fall into
the trance and do his bidding.

28:45.903 --> 28:49.905
- Who's in that photo with Van Zant?
- That is my one

28:49.907 --> 28:52.341
and only photo of Mr. Frost.

28:52.342 --> 28:54.610
An enigmatic individual,
to say the least.

28:54.611 --> 28:56.412
You three look pretty comfortable.

28:56.413 --> 28:58.614
Indeed. We three share

28:58.615 --> 29:01.284
a deep and abiding passion
for the conjurer's art.

29:01.285 --> 29:04.420
Funny. Frost said
he never knew Van Zant.

29:04.421 --> 29:06.555
Well, that is a bit odd.

29:06.557 --> 29:08.324
You can see from the photo
they're well acquainted.

29:08.325 --> 29:11.460
Why would Frost hide
his connection to Van Zant?

29:12.396 --> 29:14.797
All I can say is,

29:14.798 --> 29:18.167
Mr. Frost is a mystery
wrapped in an enigma.

29:24.174 --> 29:26.309
Merlini and Celeste
were having an affair?

29:26.310 --> 29:28.311
Torrid, too, according
to these letters.

29:28.312 --> 29:30.313
Seems like quite a read.

29:30.314 --> 29:32.682
But if he's so passionate about
Celeste, why would he kill her?

29:32.683 --> 29:35.351
Take a look at these. They're
all from the last few days.

29:35.352 --> 29:37.420
She broke it off with him.

29:37.421 --> 29:39.889
Maybe that's what Celeste
meant when she said "it's over."

29:39.890 --> 29:41.891
We need to look into this more.

29:41.892 --> 29:43.893
Yeah. I need to get these back
before he notices.

29:43.894 --> 29:45.340
I'm gonna pay a visit to Mr. Frost.

29:45.341 --> 29:46.862
He lied about not knowing Van Zant.

29:46.863 --> 29:49.565
Well, don't go alone.
I hear he's shady.

29:57.140 --> 30:00.209
- Didn't mean to startle you.
- I was just looking for you.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.197
You offered to mesmerise me earlier. I

30:02.198 --> 30:04.313
thought I'd take you up on the offer.

30:04.314 --> 30:07.116
Then take a seat.

30:09.886 --> 30:13.622
Place both of your feet firmly
but comfortably on the ground.

30:13.624 --> 30:16.959
And I want you to listen
very carefully.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.029
Look at my finger.
And now close your eyes.

30:20.030 --> 30:23.632
Open your eyes again.

30:23.634 --> 30:26.202
Now follow my finger with your eyes.

30:26.203 --> 30:28.504
You'll find it very difficult
to keep your eyes open

30:28.505 --> 30:31.173
as I move my finger...

30:34.745 --> 30:36.812
Thanks for coming, Mary.

30:36.813 --> 30:39.282
Well, I realised you can't just
get over an irrational fear,

30:39.283 --> 30:41.484
you have to face it and conquer it.

30:41.485 --> 30:43.519
Deal's done, Frost!

30:43.520 --> 30:45.521
The deal still stands!

30:45.522 --> 30:47.586
Two magicians fighting,
what's going to happen?

30:47.587 --> 30:48.658
What do you think is going to happen

30:48.659 --> 30:50.271
they're going to fire lightning
bolts at each other?

30:50.272 --> 30:53.562
- I don't know!
- Take it, but not a penny more!

30:53.563 --> 30:55.564
Think you're rid of me,
well, think again,

30:55.565 --> 30:57.566
because I know

30:57.567 --> 31:00.035
the truth!

31:02.873 --> 31:05.174
- Quick question.
- I thought you were under.

31:05.175 --> 31:06.535
Not quite. Could I be made to do

31:06.536 --> 31:08.210
something that I wouldn't normally do?

31:08.211 --> 31:11.914
- Depends, really. Now watch my finger...
- Depends on what, exactly?

31:11.915 --> 31:15.184
The mesmerist's skill,
the subject's suggestibility,

31:15.185 --> 31:17.520
the specific orders being
given... can I continue?

31:17.521 --> 31:18.233
Sure.

31:18.234 --> 31:20.423
As I move my finger, you
will find it very diff...

31:20.424 --> 31:23.626
For example, could I be made
to do something harmful?

31:23.627 --> 31:26.862
I give up. You are what we
call in the trade "a hard case."

31:26.863 --> 31:28.964
I'm sorry, Merlini.

31:28.965 --> 31:31.734
Not everyone can be induced.

31:31.735 --> 31:34.570
- Winnie's also a hard case.
- You tried to hypnotise Winnie?

31:34.571 --> 31:37.540
- She wanted to learn.
- Anyone else?

31:37.541 --> 31:40.743
- What about Celeste?
- Why do you ask?

31:40.744 --> 31:42.745
I'm just curious.

31:42.746 --> 31:44.814
Who hired you for this job?

31:44.815 --> 31:47.583
- Oswald.
- And what did he hire you to do?

31:47.584 --> 31:50.186
To be Van Zant's assistant.

31:52.189 --> 31:54.623
I do more than hypnotism in my act,

31:54.624 --> 31:56.659
I also do telepathy. Mind-reading.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.961
It's not possible
to read people's minds.

31:58.962 --> 32:01.964
But it is possible to read faces
and know when a person's lying.

32:01.965 --> 32:03.833
It's called a "tell".

32:03.834 --> 32:06.602
- Do you know yours?
- Who says that I have one?

32:08.572 --> 32:11.607
Everyone has a tell.

32:12.943 --> 32:15.077
Good day, Emily.

32:18.115 --> 32:20.516
- You let Merlini hypnotise you?
- He calls it mesmerising.

32:20.517 --> 32:22.130
I don't care what he
calls it, you don't let

32:22.131 --> 32:23.786
a mind-controlling
murderer mind-control you!

32:23.787 --> 32:26.956
Alleged mind-controlling. And
I was completely under control.

32:26.957 --> 32:29.792
Fine. Did you find out
anything about the affair?

32:29.793 --> 32:32.428
Nothing. He completely clammed
up. What about you and Mary?

32:32.429 --> 32:34.964
- Did you get anything on Frost?
- We saw him tussling with Van Zant.

32:34.965 --> 32:36.966
- Tussling over what?
- Money, apparently.

32:36.967 --> 32:38.278
Frost said he knew the truth about him

32:38.279 --> 32:39.802
and Van Zant threw a
bag of cash at him.

32:39.803 --> 32:42.171
- Sounds like blackmail.
- But what does he have on him?

32:42.172 --> 32:44.373
Proof that he killed his wife?

32:44.374 --> 32:47.543
Whatever he has on Van Zant,
we need to find out what it is.

32:47.544 --> 32:50.112
What's going on in here?

32:50.113 --> 32:51.981
- Did you come up with a new trick?
- Yes.

32:51.982 --> 32:54.383
- Can I see it?
- No.

32:54.384 --> 32:56.385
- Because you're fired.
- What?

32:56.386 --> 32:59.788
Van Zant and I don't
always see eye to eye,

32:59.790 --> 33:03.325
- but one thing we can agree on?
- The magician's code of secrecy.

33:03.326 --> 33:06.061
You broke the code, Frankie Drake.

33:06.062 --> 33:08.631
Give my regards to your
associate, Trudy Clarke.

33:08.632 --> 33:10.132
And by the way...

33:10.133 --> 33:12.835
you touch your suprasternal
notch when you lie.

33:12.836 --> 33:14.637
That's your tell.

33:18.708 --> 33:21.744
Trudy, I'm sorry I was
such a scaredy-cat last time.

33:21.745 --> 33:23.746
No, you were fine.

33:23.747 --> 33:26.081
Thank you for saying that,
but I've made up my mind.

33:26.082 --> 33:28.617
- I'm gonna be brave.
- Good for you.

33:30.086 --> 33:32.288
Well, that's strange.

33:36.092 --> 33:38.360
Mr. Frost?

33:38.361 --> 33:40.529
Anyone in here?

33:42.432 --> 33:44.667
Are you sure this is
a good idea, Trudy?

33:44.668 --> 33:47.236
What happened to you being brave?

33:47.237 --> 33:49.305
You're right.

33:49.306 --> 33:51.774
There's nothing to be afraid of.

33:57.247 --> 34:00.716
(SCREAMING)

34:07.345 --> 34:09.813
I haven't spoken to Frost in months.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.815
I know you paid him off, Van
Zant. What did he have on you?

34:11.815 --> 34:14.417
I don't know what you're
talking about. I have to work.

34:14.418 --> 34:17.087
- Just have a few more questions...
- Goodbye.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.089
Good luck with your trick.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.659
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Winnie.

34:23.661 --> 34:26.897
I wanted to show you my new trick.
Would you please close the door

34:26.898 --> 34:30.167
- and lock it?
- Of course, Mr. Van Zant.

34:34.438 --> 34:37.641
You're not welcome here,
Drake. You broke the code.

34:37.641 --> 34:40.443
I think you broke a couple
yourself, Merlini.

34:40.445 --> 34:43.045
Like the one about coveting
thy neighbour's wife.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.916
So that's what you were doing
in my dressing room.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.612
You know you should really be more

34:47.614 --> 34:49.619
careful about hiding
your love letters.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.389
What if Van Zant found out?

34:54.292 --> 34:56.993
Maybe that's exactly
what you wanted to happen.

34:56.994 --> 34:59.262
Guess again.

34:59.263 --> 35:03.066
- You're lying.
- Is that right.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.969
Everyone's got a tell.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.973
- (SIGHING)
- Look.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.109
Celeste was never going to leave
the bastard of her own volition.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.111
So you thought if Van Zant found
out, her hand would be forced?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.514
I was a fool.

35:17.515 --> 35:20.183
She chose Van Zant over me.
Not because she loved him.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.542
She could hardly stand
the sight of him.

35:21.543 --> 35:22.385
So why did she stay?

35:22.386 --> 35:25.522
She said it was "a complicated
financial obligation."

35:25.523 --> 35:27.490
- What does that mean?
- I didn't ask.

35:27.492 --> 35:31.294
She didn't tell.
Magi's code and all that.

35:34.365 --> 35:37.300
- I don't think Merlini did it.
- Me neither.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.136
So then Van Zant killed Frost.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.973
Sounds like a solid theory, but
how does that connect to Celeste?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.875
(DOOR OPENS)

35:44.876 --> 35:47.944
Gals! Ooh! So...

35:47.945 --> 35:50.080
I snuck a peek at some of
the files on Greyson's desk,

35:50.081 --> 35:52.749
and... I'm a bit out of breath.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.751
It's okay, Mary. What did you find?

35:54.752 --> 35:56.625
Turns out Frost was named as a suspect

35:56.626 --> 35:58.255
in a theft about five years back.

35:58.256 --> 36:01.491
- What's he accused of stealing?
- That's where it got a bit murky.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.460
It said was an unusual sort of theft,

36:03.461 --> 36:05.428
but nothing more.

36:05.429 --> 36:08.365
I think it's time we took
a look at Frost's warehouse.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.934
Again?

36:10.935 --> 36:13.036
So an inventor goes to Frost

36:13.037 --> 36:15.038
with an idea for
a brilliant new illusion.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.040
Let's call it The Flaming Swords.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.576
Frost sees that the idea is special.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.578
The kind of trick you'd
"sell your soul for."

36:21.579 --> 36:24.948
He gets greedy. Decides to cut the
inventor out and steals the idea.

36:24.949 --> 36:27.350
The inventor files a theft
report with the police...

36:27.351 --> 36:29.352
That's where it gets tricky.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.755
How do you prove someone
stole your idea?

36:31.756 --> 36:35.358
He takes the stolen idea and
makes a secret deal with Van Zant.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.061
There's gotta be some
sort of record of that.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.730
- I haven't seen any records anywhere.
- Let's keep looking.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.568
(GASPING)

36:47.605 --> 36:50.573
Magicians and their secrets.

36:56.781 --> 37:00.350
Now, like every death-defying trick,

37:00.351 --> 37:04.387
you first start by proving it's real.

37:05.823 --> 37:07.390
(GASPING)

37:07.391 --> 37:09.559
This is strange.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.063
Frost has a file on Celeste Van Zant.

37:14.131 --> 37:16.900
It's a contract. Celeste and Van Zant

37:16.901 --> 37:19.703
promised 50% of their earnings
to Mr. Frost

37:19.704 --> 37:21.538
for the rest of their lives.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.807
What on earth did they get in return?

37:23.808 --> 37:25.842
And now, with the flick of a switch,

37:25.843 --> 37:28.144
the magic trick blade is released...

37:28.145 --> 37:30.013
and...

37:31.449 --> 37:34.417
Voilà! The Magic Guillotine.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.987
It's amazing, Mr. Van Zant.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.055
It's gonna put me back on top.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.226
Hey, gals, take a look at this.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.297
It's a blueprint
for the Flaming Swords.

37:47.298 --> 37:49.299
Martha Hudson...

37:49.300 --> 37:51.301
Sellers' assistant is Winnie Hudson.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.803
- They must be related.
- She's out to settle the score.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.473
Could it be that Winnie
hypnotised Celeste?

37:56.474 --> 37:58.816
"Don't forget to smile."
That must be the cue.

37:58.817 --> 38:00.143
We need to find her.

38:00.144 --> 38:02.525
I saw her with Van Zant.
He's showing her his new trick.

38:04.448 --> 38:08.118
That was an incredible
demonstration, Mr. Van Zant.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.121
I'd love to see how it all looks
when you perform it.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.157
You want me to have
a go at it, do you?

38:15.293 --> 38:17.961
Why not? Strap me in.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.266
You know, I can't thank you
enough, Winnie.

38:24.769 --> 38:27.971
I am happy to assist until you
can find a full-time replacement.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.808
I don't mean only for that, I mean for

38:29.809 --> 38:31.675
coming up with the
idea for this trick.

38:31.676 --> 38:35.145
Well, I had a good teacher. My
mother was an amateur magician.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.881
And inventor.

38:37.882 --> 38:40.183
- Was?
- Died a few years ago.

38:40.184 --> 38:42.652
Never able to achieve her dream
of becoming a magician.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.922
Well, let's face it, the world
isn't ready for lady magicians.

38:45.923 --> 38:49.726
Funny. That's what the male
club owners always said to her.

38:49.727 --> 38:53.496
- Ah! What are you doing?
- Trust me, it'll go easier this way.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.266
- Have you gone mad? Let me out!
- That's the sound of me

38:56.267 --> 38:58.902
disengaging the trick blade.
So when the guillotine falls,

38:58.903 --> 39:01.604
- so will your head.
- No! No!

39:01.605 --> 39:03.118
Whatever it is you're
gonna do, don't do it.

39:03.119 --> 39:05.129
Stay back, or I cut
this rope and he dies.

39:05.130 --> 39:06.943
You don't want to do this, Winnie.

39:06.944 --> 39:09.446
- I need to finish this.
- I know what happened.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.781
Frost stole the trick
from your relative Martha...

39:11.782 --> 39:15.718
- My mother.
- Then sold it to Celeste and Van Zant.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.622
- Now you wanna get revenge.
- That's it in a nutshell.

39:19.623 --> 39:22.592
What I don't understand
is why use Sellers' coin

39:22.593 --> 39:26.096
to jam the gears?
Why make him look guilty?

39:26.097 --> 39:28.465
What's the key to any magic trick?

39:35.239 --> 39:38.942
- Misdirection.
- Nice way to use the trap door.

39:38.943 --> 39:41.478
All that magic training paid off.

39:42.813 --> 39:46.049
What? You're not gonna let me out?

39:46.050 --> 39:49.120
You're the magician. Do it yourself.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.667
♪ [SUSPENSEFUL]

39:56.996 --> 39:59.398
We were playing small clubs,
just getting by.

39:59.399 --> 40:02.401
Celeste said that we needed
to find one big trick.

40:02.402 --> 40:05.571
So she went to Frost and you
two bought the Flaming Swords.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.238
We didn't have any money to pay for it

40:07.239 --> 40:08.941
at the time, so we
made an arrangement.

40:08.942 --> 40:11.410
50% of your earnings
for the rest of your career.

40:11.411 --> 40:14.246
- You sold your souls.
- That's what I said to Celeste,

40:14.247 --> 40:17.349
- but she could be very persuasive.
- Classy move,

40:17.350 --> 40:19.351
putting the blame on your dead wife.

40:19.352 --> 40:21.353
Frost stole the idea
from Martha Hudson.

40:21.354 --> 40:24.122
And she had to raise
Winnie all by herself.

40:24.123 --> 40:27.092
She could have used that money.
She died a few years later.

40:27.093 --> 40:29.127
Van Zant.

40:31.764 --> 40:34.900
I hereby renounce your
membership at the Magic Mansion.

40:34.901 --> 40:37.703
Your privileges are
permanently revoked.

40:37.704 --> 40:41.173
You are banished for life.

40:49.816 --> 40:52.250
The first of many changes
to come to the Mansion.

40:52.252 --> 40:54.553
Looks like you're on the road
back to Utopia.

40:54.554 --> 40:57.356
Thank you, Miss Clarke.
And Miss Drake.

40:57.357 --> 41:00.125
Don't know how I can ever truly
repay you for all that you've done.

41:00.126 --> 41:02.995
Well, we wouldn't say no
to a couple of free tickets.

41:02.996 --> 41:06.765
Of course! You've both done a
great service to the Magic Mansion.

41:06.766 --> 41:09.201
Well, it's our pleasure.

41:10.937 --> 41:13.438
But you should really keep
a better eye on your watch.

41:13.439 --> 41:17.109
- (CHUCKLING)
- Quick hands.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.115
Ben?

41:23.116 --> 41:25.183
I heard I might find you here, Emily.

41:25.184 --> 41:28.453
- Or should I say Frankie.
- Thank you.

41:30.123 --> 41:31.926
So I hear congratulations
are in order.

41:31.927 --> 41:33.358
Yes, I am the new headliner

41:33.359 --> 41:36.128
at the Magic Mansion. Wish it happened
under different circumstances,

41:36.129 --> 41:38.664
- but...
- I'm happy for you anyway.

41:38.665 --> 41:41.033
Thank you. Me too.

41:41.034 --> 41:43.702
So I came by to see if you...

41:43.703 --> 41:45.704
maybe wanted to help me celebrate?

41:47.140 --> 41:50.642
I am with my girls tonight.

41:52.779 --> 41:55.280
- How about tomorrow?
- It's a date.

42:01.254 --> 42:04.256
Nothing like a glass of
whiskey to celebrate the end

42:04.257 --> 42:07.125
of another case.

42:07.126 --> 42:09.261
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

42:09.262 --> 42:12.464
- But you did anyway.
- Yeah.

42:12.465 --> 42:15.667
I did.

42:15.668 --> 42:18.470
So, hot date with a magician, huh?

42:18.471 --> 42:20.672
I never quite figured you

42:20.673 --> 42:22.741
for the type who'd go
for all that flash.

42:22.742 --> 42:24.810
Well, he's got a lot more than flash.

42:24.811 --> 42:28.046
I'm sure he is a man of substance

42:28.047 --> 42:30.148
and moral character.

42:31.618 --> 42:34.186
Is that jealousy that I hear?

42:34.187 --> 42:36.588
Come on.

42:36.589 --> 42:39.858
You can do better than that. Hm?

42:39.859 --> 42:41.522
You know, Greyson, you don't always

42:41.523 --> 42:43.261
have to make things so complicated.

42:43.262 --> 42:45.330
Sometimes what you're looking for

42:45.331 --> 42:47.265
is right in front of your nose.

42:48.534 --> 42:51.536
- Thanks for the tip.
- Anytime.

42:51.537 --> 42:54.339
See ya around, Frankie Drake.

42:54.340 --> 42:56.408
See ya around.

42:56.409 --> 43:00.178
(WHOOPING AND LAUGHING)

43:00.179 --> 43:02.547
- My goodness.
- Looks like you got your hands full,

43:02.548 --> 43:04.950
- and it's not with drinks.
- Nothing I can't handle.

43:04.951 --> 43:07.185
She's fightin' them off with a stick!

43:07.186 --> 43:09.521
Now that's a gal after my own heart.

43:09.522 --> 43:11.590
Tonight is about us.

43:11.591 --> 43:15.093
Here's to Mary finally
overcoming her magic phobia.

43:15.094 --> 43:16.795
Well, I don't know about that.

43:16.796 --> 43:19.064
I'm no Merlini, but
I don't see any magic shows

43:19.065 --> 43:21.967
- in my immediate future.
- A toast.

43:21.968 --> 43:24.669
To another case solved by the
Drake Private Detective agency.

43:24.671 --> 43:27.506
And to the three best friends
a gal could have.

- Aw, cheers!
- Cheers!

Cheers!
