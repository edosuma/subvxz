00:51.125 --> 00:52.526
All right,
everyone out to bed.

00:52.659 --> 00:54.727
Come on, leave everything.

02:57.818 --> 03:00.520
Right. Time for bed.

03:00.653 --> 03:02.656
I'm not tired.

03:02.788 --> 03:05.191
Well, they look like
very heavy eyes to me.

03:05.325 --> 03:06.859
I'm not!

03:06.993 --> 03:09.629
So how do you explain that
little sleep-talking fiasco

03:09.763 --> 03:11.265
at dinner, hmm?

03:11.397 --> 03:12.365
My body's tired,

03:12.498 --> 03:14.000
but my mind's awake.

03:14.133 --> 03:14.967
Hmm.

03:15.102 --> 03:16.536
Well, that's one very big mind

03:16.669 --> 03:18.905
for one very tiny little girl.

03:19.038 --> 03:21.106
Will you tell me
a bedtime story?

03:21.241 --> 03:22.142
Please?

03:23.409 --> 03:26.645
You've been out all day
and it's very late!

03:26.780 --> 03:29.449
But I'm not tired. Please!

03:29.582 --> 03:30.516
You promised.

03:34.055 --> 03:38.359
How is it that when you barely
can keep your eyes open,

03:38.491 --> 03:42.929
the second you get into bed,
you're wide awake?

03:43.062 --> 03:45.598
It's called
psychological insomnia.

03:45.733 --> 03:46.667
Oh.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.435
When did you get to be so smart?

03:48.568 --> 03:50.871
I get it from you.

03:53.606 --> 03:55.109
All right,

03:55.241 --> 03:57.409
but only because
you're my favorite grandchild.

03:57.544 --> 03:59.445
I'm your only grandchild.

04:16.228 --> 04:18.899
And who is this story about,
Iris?

04:24.538 --> 04:26.072
Ballerinas.

04:32.512 --> 04:34.179
Red.

04:36.716 --> 04:37.983
Blue.

04:40.220 --> 04:42.989
Green.

04:43.122 --> 04:45.925
Orange.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.593
Indigo.

04:47.728 --> 04:49.995
Violet.

04:50.129 --> 04:51.430
Yellow.

05:13.052 --> 05:14.221
Once upon a time,

05:14.355 --> 05:17.658
in a distant world
far, far away,

05:17.790 --> 05:21.293
there was
a magical crystal kingdom.

05:54.261 --> 05:57.364
They were all wonderful dancers

05:57.497 --> 06:01.935
and their colors
were bold and bright,

06:02.069 --> 06:05.872
and they spent their days
playing and laughing

06:06.005 --> 06:07.306
and having fun.

06:07.439 --> 06:09.209
It was a magical place
where they could do

06:09.343 --> 06:13.680
their most favorite thing
of all time: dance.

06:33.966 --> 06:36.735
However...

06:36.870 --> 06:39.305
there was an evil queen.

06:41.074 --> 06:46.379
The evil queen of darkness.

07:08.634 --> 07:11.170
Gran, she sounds creepy.

07:16.076 --> 07:18.512
Silently...

07:18.644 --> 07:22.314
she plotted a way
to take over their kingdom.

07:22.449 --> 07:26.752
She was so powerful
that she could writ the colors

07:26.887 --> 07:29.689
of all their happiness.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.966
But remember,

07:39.098 --> 07:41.935
wherever there is darkness,

07:42.067 --> 07:46.271
there is always light.

07:48.007 --> 07:49.408
Oh!

08:00.786 --> 08:02.221
So what are these?

08:02.355 --> 08:03.757
Coenzyme with every meal,

08:03.889 --> 08:06.659
and arjun three times a day
for heart function,

08:06.793 --> 08:08.929
hawthorn,
the heart healthy herb,

08:09.062 --> 08:11.965
and this is spirulina.

08:13.199 --> 08:14.600
Set up a chemist at this rate.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.769
Uh, I'll drop a checklist
so we can keep track.

08:16.903 --> 08:18.272
Yeah, that'd be great.

08:18.404 --> 08:20.072
The inhibitors, propranolol,
and blood thinners

08:20.206 --> 08:21.641
we absolutely cannot forget.

08:21.774 --> 08:24.076
Maybe underline those
or put them in red?

08:29.949 --> 08:31.183

09:22.769 --> 09:23.736
Cool!

09:23.870 --> 09:26.072
Do they actually work?

09:26.206 --> 09:27.807
I don't like your shoes.

09:27.941 --> 09:29.209
Hey!

09:29.341 --> 09:30.943
What? There's no better way
to tell you.

09:31.076 --> 09:32.745
You wear them all the time.

09:32.879 --> 09:33.913
Mom likes them.

09:34.047 --> 09:35.215
An outfit's like a diary.

09:35.349 --> 09:37.684
It says everything
about yourself.

09:37.817 --> 09:39.218
What does mine say to you?

09:39.351 --> 09:41.454
That you like yellow.

09:42.621 --> 09:45.724
Elegance, grace.

09:45.859 --> 09:47.127
Clearly, when I grow up,

09:47.260 --> 09:50.129
I'm going to be as big
as Anna Pavlova.

09:52.032 --> 09:53.533
Who?

09:53.667 --> 09:54.401
The ballerina.

09:54.534 --> 09:55.867
You know this.

09:56.001 --> 09:59.605
Do I really have to go through
our ballet history again?

10:01.474 --> 10:03.643
She was the greatest dancer
in the world.

10:03.775 --> 10:05.778
Now, I'm going to be
as big as her one day.

10:05.913 --> 10:07.346
I'm joining The Royal Ballet,

10:07.480 --> 10:10.082
and I'm going to perform
for real kings and queens.

10:10.216 --> 10:11.585
That sounds serious.

10:11.717 --> 10:12.552
How do you join?

10:12.686 --> 10:13.653
You don't join, silly.

10:13.785 --> 10:14.920
You get picked.

10:15.054 --> 10:16.255
That's why
I have to be the best.

10:16.389 --> 10:18.290
You can help me, if you like.

10:18.424 --> 10:20.359
Okay, what do I do?

10:20.494 --> 10:22.829
Stand here,
put your hands here,

10:22.962 --> 10:24.463
and lift me up on three.

10:24.596 --> 10:27.134
One, two...

10:29.034 --> 10:30.269
On second thought,

10:30.403 --> 10:32.971
Mom always said
I have two left feet.

10:33.105 --> 10:34.640
Suit yourself.

10:34.774 --> 10:36.143
I can't stay, anyways.

10:36.275 --> 10:39.379
I just wanted to show you
the walkie-talkies.

10:43.283 --> 10:46.919
Hey, Iris,
if you do join The Royal Ballet,

10:47.052 --> 10:48.355
will you still live at home?

10:48.489 --> 10:51.591
No. I'll have to live
with the other dancers.

10:53.158 --> 10:54.427
You can come to all my shows

10:54.561 --> 10:56.196
and send me flowers
to my dressing room,

10:56.328 --> 10:57.563
if you like.

10:57.697 --> 10:58.865
I'll let you backstage.

10:58.998 --> 11:00.300

See you later.

11:44.110 --> 11:44.945
Oh!

11:46.212 --> 11:47.746
Oh, I swear...

11:47.880 --> 11:51.784
if I step on another one
of these flipping penguins...

11:56.556 --> 11:59.359
And that is why I married you.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.703
Ooh, don't mind me.

12:09.836 --> 12:11.538
It was hanging
on the bathroom door.

12:11.672 --> 12:13.907
Think you need to be on
the espresso martinis tonight.

12:14.039 --> 12:15.140
I look that bad?

12:15.274 --> 12:17.177
Double strength.

12:19.011 --> 12:20.078
I mean, I don't know.

12:20.212 --> 12:21.714
Look, maybe
we shouldn't go tonight.

12:21.849 --> 12:23.984
I need to be back on the farm
at 5:00 in the morning.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.250
They're your friends, not mine.

12:25.384 --> 12:28.688
Oh, I'm here with Iris.

12:28.822 --> 12:31.191
Go, enjoy yourselves!

12:31.323 --> 12:33.793
When was the last time
you two went out?

12:33.927 --> 12:34.995
She does have a point.

12:35.128 --> 12:36.797
We'll be three hours, tops.

12:36.929 --> 12:39.565
So mine and James's numbers
are on your phone.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.334
Do you remember
how to find contacts?

12:41.467 --> 12:44.170
I can show you again,
if you want.

12:44.303 --> 12:46.807
Here's them written down,
just in case.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.610
Also, these are the neighbors,
and this is the couple

12:50.743 --> 12:52.646
across the road that keep
putting stuff in our bins.

12:54.047 --> 12:55.748
I'm so gonna catch them one day.

12:55.881 --> 12:57.750
Don't call them
before you try Sarah.

12:57.884 --> 12:59.519
She's the one up the road,
you know,

12:59.652 --> 13:01.153
the one whose brother's
a doctor.

13:01.288 --> 13:05.392
And worst comes to worst,
this is Ian, and he's a vet.

13:05.524 --> 13:08.193
Dogs, humans, same thing, right?

13:08.327 --> 13:09.862
But call me
if you need anything.

13:09.996 --> 13:12.798
My phone's on loud all night.

13:12.932 --> 13:15.000
Remember,
just one scoop of the pink.

13:15.134 --> 13:16.369
Best do it yourself.

13:16.503 --> 13:18.104
Saying no is like saying yes
with her.

13:18.236 --> 13:20.372
Hmm, like mother, like daughter.

13:20.505 --> 13:22.475
Just don't be lenient, okay?

13:22.609 --> 13:24.944
Lights out at 7:00,
even if she doesn't wanna sleep,

13:25.077 --> 13:26.178
she needs the rest.

13:26.312 --> 13:27.547
Oh, I'm gonna fall asleep

13:27.681 --> 13:29.215
by the time
this conversation's over.

13:29.349 --> 13:30.817
Oh, just go already!

13:30.950 --> 13:32.451
And call us.

13:58.879 --> 14:02.014
Point your toes more
as you spin.

14:02.148 --> 14:03.783
Mmh-mm, and once more,

14:03.916 --> 14:05.719
or Gran'll have to show you
how it's done.

14:05.851 --> 14:09.355
Be careful, Gran,
you're really old.

14:12.292 --> 14:14.827
And third position.

14:14.961 --> 14:16.629
And fifth.

14:16.763 --> 14:17.931
And hold it.

14:18.063 --> 14:21.367
Hold it, hold it!

14:32.477 --> 14:34.680
What was it like?

14:34.813 --> 14:35.881
What's that?

14:36.014 --> 14:37.116
Being a dancer.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.219
What was it like?

14:40.352 --> 14:43.889
Well, as you said,
I'm a dinosaur,

14:44.023 --> 14:46.826
so, honestly, I don't really
remember anything.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.828
Hmm, fair enough.

14:55.634 --> 14:59.605
I didn't really fit in anywhere
when I was your age.

14:59.739 --> 15:02.075
I was actually pretty shy.

15:02.207 --> 15:03.709
You, shy?

15:04.644 --> 15:07.179
Hard to believe I know.

15:07.312 --> 15:09.848
But one day,

15:09.982 --> 15:12.551
I was given a pair
of smelly old

15:12.686 --> 15:16.122
secondhand ballet shoes.

15:16.254 --> 15:19.091
- Ew.
- Oh, no.

15:19.225 --> 15:21.360
Best present ever.

15:21.494 --> 15:24.029
'Cause when I put them on

15:24.163 --> 15:26.765
and the music would start,

15:26.899 --> 15:32.237
it was like
whatever I was doing,

15:32.371 --> 15:36.208
I was confident and brave.

15:36.341 --> 15:39.611
I could be anyone I wanted.

15:39.745 --> 15:44.317
Like the shoes were magic.

15:44.451 --> 15:46.284
Wow.

15:46.418 --> 15:49.187
I worked very hard
to be a dancer.

15:49.322 --> 15:53.592
On my point, my posture,
my strength.

15:53.725 --> 15:56.495
You have to be very strong
to be a dancer.

15:56.629 --> 16:00.633
Imagine a string
pulling you right the way up

16:00.765 --> 16:02.868
through the center of your body.

16:03.001 --> 16:04.235
That's it.

16:04.370 --> 16:06.172
That's it.
Hold it.

16:06.306 --> 16:08.908
Hold it.

16:09.042 --> 16:10.176
Keep it there,

16:10.309 --> 16:13.813
no matter what happens.

16:15.081 --> 16:17.015
Like... like what?

16:20.419 --> 16:21.286
Gran, stop it.

16:21.421 --> 16:23.156
Posture, Iris, posture!

16:27.159 --> 16:28.427
You'll sleep well tonight.

16:28.561 --> 16:32.197
Can you finish the story
about the colors?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.100
Okay, where were we?

16:35.235 --> 16:37.570
They were happy
and they were dancing,

16:37.702 --> 16:41.006
and then darkness came
to ruin everything.

16:41.140 --> 16:42.507
That's right.

16:42.642 --> 16:44.711
Party pooper.

16:44.844 --> 16:48.347
I don't like her very much.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.384
No.

16:51.517 --> 16:53.386
Me neither.

16:56.789 --> 17:01.026
The dancers' world
had been very happy,

17:01.160 --> 17:04.163
but when darkness came,

17:04.297 --> 17:07.133
she brought with her shadows

17:07.267 --> 17:10.537
that were like no other.

17:16.909 --> 17:19.679
The shadows hung
over the kingdom

17:19.810 --> 17:22.647
like a dark cloud,

17:22.781 --> 17:26.086
following the colors
wherever they went.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.721
Colors tried to ignore them,

17:27.854 --> 17:31.356
they tried to carry on dancing,
having fun,

17:31.490 --> 17:34.759
but the shadows
were always there.

17:34.894 --> 17:36.730
Wherever they turned,
wherever they looked,

17:36.863 --> 17:41.101
there they were,
draining them...

17:42.669 --> 17:45.905
...of their color
and their happiness.

17:48.507 --> 17:52.245
Colors couldn't fight back,

17:52.378 --> 17:54.079
and gradually,

17:54.213 --> 17:59.117
their radiant colors
began to fade

17:59.250 --> 18:02.421
as they lost hope.

18:02.555 --> 18:05.858
The kingdom grew
darker and darker,

18:05.991 --> 18:09.361
the colors, duller and duller,

18:09.494 --> 18:15.166
until all that was left
was black.

18:33.385 --> 18:34.319
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:34.453 --> 18:37.223
She's in the living room.

18:47.467 --> 18:50.169
That's great.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.272
And we're all done.

18:56.742 --> 18:58.979
Can we have a quick word?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.257
Have you talked to Iris
about transplant?

19:12.557 --> 19:15.528
Um, we're not there yet, are we?

19:15.662 --> 19:17.963
Surely, there's
something else first.

19:18.097 --> 19:20.365
It was never definite, was it?

19:20.500 --> 19:21.867
With cardiomyopathy,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.002
we need the thinners
to do their job.

19:24.136 --> 19:25.238
They haven't.

19:25.371 --> 19:27.774
So heart function
has deteriorated significantly.

19:27.906 --> 19:29.541
The next step would be
to contact the cardio team

19:29.674 --> 19:34.280
and discuss Iris being added
to the list for a donor heart.

19:36.281 --> 19:37.483
You're serious.

19:37.616 --> 19:39.518
Be a case of waiting,
keeping busy,

19:39.652 --> 19:41.421
makin' the most,
having fun

19:41.554 --> 19:43.490
when she feels well enough.

19:43.623 --> 19:48.394
But she will get a heart,
won't she?

19:48.528 --> 19:50.063
How many are on the list?

19:50.195 --> 19:51.763
There are usually
around 40 children in the UK

19:51.897 --> 19:53.899
waiting for hearts
at any one time.

19:54.034 --> 19:56.001
Each child needs a heart
that's the right size,

19:56.134 --> 19:58.770
and in Iris' case,
blood type, too.

19:58.903 --> 20:00.405
Child donors are rare,

20:00.538 --> 20:03.509
mainly because parents
never imagine losing a child.

20:03.642 --> 20:04.943
They don't think about donation

20:05.076 --> 20:07.813
or consider it
if the worst should happen.

20:07.946 --> 20:11.116
How long is
she gonna have to wait?

20:11.250 --> 20:12.250
For an O-negative child,

20:12.384 --> 20:15.422
statistically,
if nothing changes,

20:15.555 --> 20:19.692
you could be looking
at around 13 to 16 months.

20:19.826 --> 20:21.861
I really am very sorry.

20:57.096 --> 20:58.663
♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪

20:58.797 --> 21:01.634
♪ And we spin and we leap ♪

21:01.767 --> 21:03.469
♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪

21:03.603 --> 21:06.404
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo ♪

21:07.673 --> 21:09.208
I landed my turn!

21:09.342 --> 21:12.612
Mommy, Daddy, look,
I can do my turn!

21:14.346 --> 21:16.816
Well, Polly,
it's nearly time for dinner.

21:16.949 --> 21:20.451
No, I wanna dance around
like this.

21:20.586 --> 21:22.221
♪ La, la, la ♪

21:22.354 --> 21:23.623
Silly Polly.

21:23.756 --> 21:28.261
You do know you can't dance
if you need a new heart.

21:41.874 --> 21:44.210
Polly will find a way.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.222
The heart pumps red blood cells,

21:57.355 --> 22:02.228
taking oxygen
to all of these organs here.

22:04.262 --> 22:06.965
You forgot about food and water.

22:07.099 --> 22:08.067
Hm?

22:08.201 --> 22:09.701
The heart also pumps
food and water

22:09.835 --> 22:12.105
to the organs,
the white blood cells,

22:12.238 --> 22:14.974
platelets, and plasma
to protect the body.

22:16.474 --> 22:18.043
Right.

22:18.176 --> 22:18.843
Right!

22:18.978 --> 22:20.580
Get to the point, Daddy.

22:20.712 --> 22:23.449
Yes, um...

22:23.582 --> 22:27.186
I'm afraid you can't
run around anymore, Iris.

22:27.318 --> 22:30.088
Not until you get
a new one of these

22:30.222 --> 22:37.096
and then all of these can get
a lot more... stuff again,

22:37.229 --> 22:38.364
okay?

22:38.498 --> 22:40.099
It's too risky, darling.

22:40.231 --> 22:43.301
We need you to be extra careful
from now on,

22:43.434 --> 22:47.139
that's why you can't dance
anymore, either.

22:47.272 --> 22:48.507
Okay.

22:48.641 --> 22:50.343
You sure?

22:50.476 --> 22:51.578
Mm-hm.

22:51.711 --> 22:55.280
- Any questions, or...
- Mm, no.

22:55.413 --> 22:58.917
Thanks, Daddy,
that was really interesting.

23:05.692 --> 23:07.593
I think that went pretty well.

23:07.726 --> 23:08.861
Yeah.

23:08.993 --> 23:12.263
Well done, I think she got that.

23:12.397 --> 23:14.533
- Hon, what's a platelet?
- I have no idea.

23:30.249 --> 23:30.915
Mm-hm.

23:31.049 --> 23:32.550
Yeah. No... no.

23:32.684 --> 23:33.418
Uh...

23:34.586 --> 23:35.753
I hear what you're saying,

23:35.887 --> 23:37.889
but I'm just not
understanding it.

23:38.023 --> 23:39.591
No, no, because...
Hey, Rick.

23:39.724 --> 23:43.328
Because what you're telling me
is that it's serious enough

23:43.462 --> 23:46.566
for her to get a new heart,
but me as her father,

23:46.699 --> 23:49.067
well, I'm... I'm just gonna
sit around and wait?

23:49.201 --> 23:51.569
Good mo... morning.

23:59.912 --> 24:01.079
Good morning there, Al,
I hope.

24:03.048 --> 24:04.215
Oh, I would say
what a surprise it was.

24:04.349 --> 24:05.717
Oh, it's the wind
and the weather.

24:05.851 --> 24:06.786
What you gonna do?

24:06.919 --> 24:08.254
You know, I just don't know

24:08.387 --> 24:09.721
what the village'd
do without you, you know?

24:09.855 --> 24:10.990
- Oh, stop.
- You're always there!

24:11.124 --> 24:12.357
It's only my job.
Come on, now.

24:12.491 --> 24:13.759
Oh. I don't know
what to do with that.

24:13.893 --> 24:15.427
Oh, nor do I.
See you later.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.360
You have a nice one.

24:16.494 --> 24:17.596
Cheers.

24:31.911 --> 24:35.748
One more time, and plié,
and up.

24:37.316 --> 24:40.853
Okay, just hold your positions,
keep those smiles.

24:40.987 --> 24:43.523
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

24:43.655 --> 24:44.757
Oh, hey there, Audrey.

24:44.891 --> 24:46.425
Oh, this one's for you.

24:46.558 --> 24:47.559
Looks really important,

24:47.692 --> 24:49.295
so I didn't wanna,
like, scrumple it

24:49.428 --> 24:51.531
by shovin' it under the door
or leavin' out here

24:51.663 --> 24:52.530
or anything like that.

24:52.664 --> 24:53.865
You know, just in case.

24:53.999 --> 24:55.101
I see.

24:55.233 --> 24:57.001
- Thanks, Rick.
- Yeah.

24:57.135 --> 24:59.838
Ooh, nasty weather, isn't it?

24:59.971 --> 25:01.673
Hey, that summer rain.

25:03.509 --> 25:05.443
So can I have it?

25:05.577 --> 25:06.711
Sorry, what's that?

25:06.845 --> 25:08.079
The letter.

25:08.213 --> 25:09.749
Oh, the letter.
Of course, the letter.

25:09.882 --> 25:11.317
Here you go.

25:11.450 --> 25:12.451
Safe and sound.

25:12.584 --> 25:13.553
Okay.

25:13.685 --> 25:14.653
To the morrow, dear maiden.

25:57.896 --> 25:59.464
What about the leaflets?

25:59.597 --> 26:01.032
Already checked.

26:01.165 --> 26:02.835
Here we are.

26:02.969 --> 26:05.703
O negative, 6.6 percent.

26:05.837 --> 26:08.173
6.6, what does that mean?

26:24.056 --> 26:25.024
Totally hopeless.

26:25.157 --> 26:28.293
Ziggy, Merrill, Fifi, Louis...

26:28.426 --> 26:31.363
Ziggy, Merrill, Fifi, Louis.

26:32.931 --> 26:34.667
Polly?

26:37.603 --> 26:38.738
Polly?

26:51.416 --> 26:52.651
Polly!

26:52.785 --> 26:55.787
Polly.

27:01.559 --> 27:04.195
So only three of them
would be a match.

27:04.329 --> 27:07.466
Is there anything positive
or useful you wanna say?

27:09.902 --> 27:11.370
Like what?

27:11.502 --> 27:13.772
A solution, what we can do,
that we'll be all right,

27:13.905 --> 27:16.875
that we've got enough money,
we can afford it.

27:17.009 --> 27:18.477
Anything would be great.

27:20.179 --> 27:21.713
I'm just looking at the facts.

27:21.846 --> 27:23.415
What'd you want me to do?

27:23.548 --> 27:26.451
Well, sounds like the facts
don't look too good, do they?

27:58.750 --> 28:02.788
I've got pink milk.

28:06.724 --> 28:08.060
Oh!

28:09.929 --> 28:13.266
I've got a sleepy Iris today,
have I?

28:16.367 --> 28:19.303
Oh, what a shame.

28:19.438 --> 28:23.476
All these biscuits
going to waste.

28:26.111 --> 28:28.848
Double chocolate.

28:47.599 --> 28:50.401
To the rainbow of colors,

28:50.536 --> 28:56.976
it felt like darkness had
taken over their whole world.

28:57.109 --> 28:59.944
They wanted to dance
and be happy

29:00.077 --> 29:04.281
like they were before.

29:04.415 --> 29:07.251
What could they do?

29:07.385 --> 29:09.555
Was there any hope?

29:23.535 --> 29:25.971
Oh, but there was.

29:28.441 --> 29:32.545
The colors had one more weapon

29:32.678 --> 29:34.413
that they could use to fight

29:34.546 --> 29:38.049
against darkness
and her shadows,

29:38.183 --> 29:44.588
and this last weapon was
the most powerful one of all.

29:46.592 --> 29:51.630
Just when things were
at their darkest,

29:51.762 --> 29:58.102
the colors found something
deep within themselves

29:58.237 --> 30:02.641
they didn't even know existed.

30:02.773 --> 30:06.077
A secret power.

30:06.211 --> 30:08.713
An energy.

30:08.846 --> 30:11.416
A belief.

30:11.549 --> 30:17.388
And using all the strength
that they had left,

30:17.521 --> 30:22.127
they imagined a future

30:22.260 --> 30:26.030
where they had defeated
the evil queen

30:26.164 --> 30:28.567
and the kingdom was happy

30:28.700 --> 30:32.203
and they were dancing again.

30:32.336 --> 30:35.740
And they put all this energy

30:35.874 --> 30:40.078
into a little ball of light,
and...

30:42.214 --> 30:45.550
...sent it out
into the darkness.

30:45.683 --> 30:47.185
And the little ball of light

30:47.318 --> 30:49.221
floated around the darkness,

30:49.354 --> 30:53.124
illuminating a path as it went.

30:53.258 --> 30:57.763
First, it was really tiny,

30:57.895 --> 31:00.965
barely noticeable.

31:01.099 --> 31:03.801
But the colors kept hoping

31:03.935 --> 31:05.569
and believing

31:05.703 --> 31:07.806
that things would get better,

31:07.939 --> 31:09.774
and as they did,

31:09.907 --> 31:13.544
the ball of light
started to grow

31:13.679 --> 31:15.748
and become brighter,

31:15.881 --> 31:23.522
until it turned into
a dazzling white light!

31:23.655 --> 31:26.759
And light danced with darkness

31:26.892 --> 31:30.596
and brought joy
back into the world.

31:30.730 --> 31:37.368
Their radiant colors
started to return,

31:37.502 --> 31:39.538
and before she knew it,

31:39.671 --> 31:42.407
darkness was overcome
by the light,

31:42.539 --> 31:43.741
and she shattered

31:43.875 --> 31:47.077
into a million
dazzling white fragments

31:47.211 --> 31:49.013
and was defeated forever.

31:57.021 --> 32:00.024
And then light rose up
into the sky

32:00.159 --> 32:02.994
and became a radiant star.

32:07.566 --> 32:12.203
And the colors looked up
at the star

32:12.337 --> 32:15.240
and they remembered

32:15.374 --> 32:17.809
that if the spirits
of darkness

32:17.942 --> 32:22.347
ever tried to take over
their kingdom again,

32:22.480 --> 32:28.186
no matter how dark
things had become,

32:28.319 --> 32:33.023
there would always be light.

32:37.563 --> 32:39.932
They really defeated her?

32:40.065 --> 32:41.901
They did.

32:57.015 --> 33:00.052
I found this little stowaway,
by the way.

33:00.184 --> 33:01.953
Polly.

33:07.625 --> 33:10.929
You had a chat to your parents
the other day.

33:11.063 --> 33:14.466
Wanna talk about it?

33:14.598 --> 33:16.067
Can I be frank?

33:16.201 --> 33:17.434
Sure.

33:17.568 --> 33:19.303
You're frank.

33:19.438 --> 33:22.675
Cards on the table.

33:22.807 --> 33:25.343
I know I should be upset
about it all,

33:25.477 --> 33:27.812
but honestly, I'm not really.

33:27.945 --> 33:29.413
No?

33:29.548 --> 33:32.050
The thing is,
if I can't dance,

33:32.183 --> 33:34.618
I'm never gonna be a ballerina.

33:34.752 --> 33:36.355
So what you'll have to do

33:36.489 --> 33:40.259
is have a very, very clear
picture of that in your mind

33:40.392 --> 33:44.062
and never, ever deviate from it.

33:44.195 --> 33:47.799
See it, believe it,

33:47.932 --> 33:54.239
and then with all your power,
you send your wish...

33:55.507 --> 33:57.909
...out into the universe,

33:58.042 --> 34:03.948
with total conviction
that it will come true.

34:04.082 --> 34:06.552
And it will.

34:19.797 --> 34:22.933
I wish I could be a ballerina.

35:21.492 --> 35:22.893
Hey, Audrey, I...

35:26.231 --> 35:28.366
Audrey, hey.

35:31.503 --> 35:32.971
You know, there's
a little place in the island

35:33.105 --> 35:35.206
I'd really recommend going to

35:35.340 --> 35:38.309
if you wanna go, you know?

35:38.443 --> 35:40.111
With me.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.464
Audrey!

35:58.597 --> 36:00.098
Hey, Rick.

36:02.233 --> 36:03.468
How are you?

36:03.601 --> 36:06.338
Yeah, I'm good, thanks. You?

36:06.471 --> 36:08.139
Yeah, great.

36:08.273 --> 36:09.106
Yeah.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.576
And you?

36:10.708 --> 36:12.476
Already asked that, haven't I?
Yeah.

36:12.610 --> 36:13.644
Yeah.

36:13.777 --> 36:15.012
Um, you know, I...

36:15.146 --> 36:18.415
I really wanted
to ask you somethin'.

36:18.550 --> 36:19.918
Are you okay?

36:22.253 --> 36:23.355
It must be the coffee.

36:26.391 --> 36:29.695
You know coffee.

36:29.827 --> 36:31.295
You were gonna ask me something.

36:33.831 --> 36:36.234
Yeah. Um...

36:36.367 --> 36:39.403
How's the show goin'?

36:39.538 --> 36:40.704
Oh.

36:40.838 --> 36:42.574
Really good. Thanks.

36:42.708 --> 36:44.776
- Good.
- Yeah.

36:44.909 --> 36:48.479
- This is yours.
- Okay.

36:48.612 --> 36:50.781
- Thanks.
- Yep, yep.

36:50.916 --> 36:52.050
- Bye.
- All right.

36:52.182 --> 36:53.351
Yep, next time.

36:53.485 --> 36:54.652
Yeah.

36:54.786 --> 36:55.954
The same place next...
never mind.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.455
- Have a nice evening, Rick.
- Okay.

37:25.983 --> 37:27.384
What's it today, then?

37:27.518 --> 37:29.253
English.

37:29.387 --> 37:31.422
Oh, we did that yesterday.

37:31.556 --> 37:32.956
Maybe it's time for some maths.

37:33.090 --> 37:34.458
No!

37:34.592 --> 37:35.594
Yes, come on, you need to.

37:35.726 --> 37:37.495
Where's your textbook?

37:37.628 --> 37:38.596
Living room.

37:38.730 --> 37:40.733
Go on, then.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.538
Can you get that too, please?

37:46.670 --> 37:49.006
Okay.

37:58.215 --> 38:00.652
Wow!

38:03.820 --> 38:05.958
Yes.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.461
Who was it?

38:11.596 --> 38:13.231
Mailman.

38:13.364 --> 38:15.266
Fractions?

38:24.909 --> 38:27.645
I wish I could be
in the Seaview Ballet show.

40:05.143 --> 40:06.811
Hi. My name's Iris.

40:06.945 --> 40:08.346
I'm eight years old,

40:08.478 --> 40:11.215
and I'm auditioning
for the Seaview Ballet show.

40:24.295 --> 40:26.764
It's harder than it looks, okay?

40:30.469 --> 40:31.936
Hi. My name's Iris,

40:32.070 --> 40:35.173

44:02.246 --> 44:05.682
You okay, my darling?

44:05.817 --> 44:07.885
Oh.

44:15.527 --> 44:17.862
Oh!

44:19.630 --> 44:24.268
Well, I had a little friend
when I was about your age

44:24.402 --> 44:26.771
called Mr. Augustus.

44:28.505 --> 44:30.641
Oh, I suppose
that's rather old fashioned.

44:30.775 --> 44:31.576
Augustus?

44:31.710 --> 44:32.744
No, I love it!

44:36.447 --> 44:39.784
So, you gonna to tell me
what all this is about?

44:39.918 --> 44:41.452
I did it, Gran, like you said.

44:41.585 --> 44:43.253
I sent my wish out
to the universe

44:43.387 --> 44:44.456
and it came true.

44:44.588 --> 44:45.724
Look.

44:48.092 --> 44:51.028
Look, Gran,
it's The Royal Ballet.

44:51.163 --> 44:55.367
I... I have to audition,
so I practiced.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.534
A bit.

44:57.668 --> 44:58.769
Okay, a lot.

44:58.902 --> 45:01.171
I've gotten so much better,
I really have.

45:01.306 --> 45:03.007
You can learn anything
off YouTube.

45:03.139 --> 45:04.342
It's pretty cool.

45:04.476 --> 45:07.778
I can even do a pirouette now.

45:07.911 --> 45:09.913
Is that right?

45:10.047 --> 45:13.717
Well, I thought we agreed
that I would be your teacher

45:13.851 --> 45:15.420
and not Mrs. Goggle.

45:15.552 --> 45:17.521
Google, Gran, Google.

45:17.655 --> 45:19.057
Darling...

45:19.190 --> 45:23.794
you've got to be grown-up
and not be silly about this.

45:23.927 --> 45:25.528
You can't go off on your own

45:25.663 --> 45:28.900
dancing day in, day out
willy-nilly.

45:29.034 --> 45:32.603
It's dangerous, you know that.

45:32.737 --> 45:34.838
But I believe in it, Gran,
I really do.

45:34.972 --> 45:37.108
I believe in it,
and I know it's gonna happen.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.210
And that's great,

45:39.344 --> 45:42.213
but you've gotta get better,
too.

45:42.347 --> 45:43.581
Will you post it for me?

45:43.715 --> 45:44.782
Please?

45:44.916 --> 45:45.850
Please, Gran?

45:45.983 --> 45:48.085
I've got the address here.

45:48.219 --> 45:53.157
Well, I suppose I...

45:53.291 --> 45:55.994
I could send it off,

45:56.126 --> 45:59.764
but you've absolutely
got to swear not to tell on me.

45:59.898 --> 46:02.767
On Augustus's life.

46:04.768 --> 46:05.769
Shake on it?

46:24.422 --> 46:26.090
Close your eyes.

46:28.492 --> 46:31.929
Close them, no peeking.

46:32.061 --> 46:34.498
Now, deep breath.

46:36.266 --> 46:38.701
And focus.

46:41.472 --> 46:42.873
There you are!

46:43.007 --> 46:45.842
Oh, I see you!

46:47.411 --> 46:49.614
You're beautiful.

46:49.746 --> 46:54.184
Oh, my little dancing Iris.

47:03.994 --> 47:05.430
You're beautiful.

47:05.563 --> 47:08.231
Oh, Iris, can you see yourself?

47:08.365 --> 47:11.268
Oh, you're magical.

47:11.402 --> 47:13.905
That's my Iris.

47:14.038 --> 47:15.173
She's out there

47:15.306 --> 47:17.509
in the spotlight.

47:17.641 --> 47:20.477
Arabesque, arabesque,

47:20.610 --> 47:22.846
pirouette, pirouette.

47:22.981 --> 47:25.216
Pas de chat, pas de chat.

47:38.096 --> 47:39.797
Well, that's up to you.

47:41.731 --> 47:44.701
Look,
it's your decision completely.

47:45.969 --> 47:47.804
Oh, one second,
see that'll be Mum.

47:51.976 --> 47:53.311
Hello.

47:54.646 --> 47:57.581
She just has
to let me have more fun.

47:57.715 --> 47:58.883
Hmm.

47:59.016 --> 48:01.786
It's not easy being a mum,
you know?

48:01.918 --> 48:02.820
Iris?

48:04.320 --> 48:05.757
What is it?

48:05.889 --> 48:07.491
Iris, your heart.

48:07.625 --> 48:10.193
You've got a heart, sweetie.

48:10.327 --> 48:12.362
She's got a heart, Mum.

48:12.496 --> 48:14.231
Darling, don't forget the bags.

48:14.365 --> 48:17.369
We need to go right now
and we need to get to the car.

48:19.369 --> 48:21.371
Gran'll be right there with you.

48:21.505 --> 48:23.775
No need to worry,
little one, okay?

48:23.907 --> 48:24.775
Okay.

48:42.659 --> 48:44.127
Come on, come on, come on.

48:51.034 --> 48:52.036
Seatbelt, Iris.

49:06.751 --> 49:08.085
Oh, come, on,
where's your mum?

49:08.219 --> 49:09.086
Just go.

49:25.135 --> 49:26.338
There'll be another.

49:28.072 --> 49:29.407
Yeah.

49:30.474 --> 49:32.410
Can I go upstairs?

49:32.543 --> 49:33.510
Yeah.

49:33.644 --> 49:35.380
Yeah, I'll be up in a minute.

49:49.425 --> 49:51.594
How'd this happen?

49:51.728 --> 49:53.797
Apparently, it happens a lot.

49:55.565 --> 49:57.801
Could have been our only chance.

50:01.539 --> 50:03.674
Mum, please don't do that again.

50:03.807 --> 50:05.509
Stepping out in front
of the car like that,

50:05.643 --> 50:08.112
you could've been killed.

50:08.246 --> 50:09.480
The last thing
I need right now

50:09.614 --> 50:11.983
is my mum ending up
in hospital, too.

50:13.916 --> 50:15.485
Would've hurt more
if you'd gone all the way down

50:15.619 --> 50:17.688
without finding out.

50:53.291 --> 50:54.959
Iris, you in there?

50:58.362 --> 51:00.064
Iris?

51:00.197 --> 51:02.833
No parents allowed.

51:03.733 --> 51:05.002
Yeah, I can see that.

51:05.135 --> 51:07.905
Uh, can you come out here
for a second?

51:10.041 --> 51:11.376
Please?

51:11.509 --> 51:13.043
Password?

51:17.280 --> 51:19.483
Iris? Princess Iris?

51:22.719 --> 51:24.488
Penguins?

51:50.681 --> 51:52.851
I'm sorry about the false alarm.

51:54.284 --> 51:56.721
Must've been
really scary for you.

51:59.023 --> 52:01.692
You know you can talk
to me about anything.

52:01.826 --> 52:04.094
You can ask me anything.

52:05.663 --> 52:07.931
I do have a question, actually.

52:08.065 --> 52:10.969
Where will
my new heart come from?

52:12.737 --> 52:17.474
Well, when a child
doesn't need theirs anymore,

52:17.608 --> 52:19.443
they can give it away

52:19.577 --> 52:22.113
and it can live on
in someone else.

52:22.246 --> 52:25.249
That's what they call
an "organ donor."

52:25.382 --> 52:28.552
And one day, very soon,

52:28.686 --> 52:30.388
a little boy
or a little girl

52:30.521 --> 52:34.525
won't need their heart anymore
and they can give it to you,

52:34.657 --> 52:37.326
and you'll feel so much better.

52:37.460 --> 52:41.131
And will I still love you
if I have someone else's heart?

52:41.264 --> 52:43.934
Oh, darling.

52:44.068 --> 52:45.770
Yes, of course,

52:45.903 --> 52:49.039
you will always be you,
no matter what.

52:49.172 --> 52:53.710
You will always love us
just as we will always love you.

52:53.844 --> 52:56.280
And I'll still love dancing?

52:57.882 --> 53:00.217
I don't think there's anything
on this planet

53:00.351 --> 53:03.854
that could stop
Miss Iris Edwards from dancing.

53:05.521 --> 53:07.057
Thanks, Dad.

53:07.190 --> 53:10.593
Mr. Augustus
says you're welcome any time.

53:10.728 --> 53:12.363
Does he?

53:12.496 --> 53:14.964
Well, thank you,
Mr. Augustus.

53:18.168 --> 53:21.438
Right, um,
I'm gonna go now, sweetie,

53:21.572 --> 53:23.708
before I have a panic attack.

53:25.710 --> 53:26.742
Red, come in.

53:26.876 --> 53:28.746
I repeat, Red, come in.

53:28.878 --> 53:32.150
It's a code 1,
I repeat, it's a code 1.

53:47.565 --> 53:49.833
So, let me get this straight.

53:49.967 --> 53:52.702
You need an actual new heart.

53:52.836 --> 53:54.572
Apparently, mine doesn't work.

53:54.704 --> 53:56.039
That sucks.

53:56.172 --> 53:57.740
Quite a bit.

53:57.875 --> 53:59.342
Maybe you could have mine?

53:59.476 --> 54:01.179
I'm pretty sure you need that.

54:01.311 --> 54:03.947
I suppose.

54:12.389 --> 54:13.690
I just have to wait.

54:13.824 --> 54:15.259
I don't mind that so much,

54:15.393 --> 54:17.829
but how am I supposed
to become a dancer now?

54:32.175 --> 54:33.376
Um, can I help?

54:33.510 --> 54:36.847
Oh, um, you know, I...
I was lookin' for Audrey.

54:36.981 --> 54:40.117
Um, I...
I have something for her.

54:40.251 --> 54:41.485
Is she around?

54:41.619 --> 54:42.952
Uh, yeah, she's here, but
she's a bit busy at the moment.

54:43.086 --> 54:44.722
Uh, I can take it for her.

54:46.623 --> 54:47.925
Well, thanks, but I...

54:48.057 --> 54:49.226
you know, I'd rather
give it to her myself.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.796
Uh, she knows me,
you know, so...

54:53.362 --> 54:55.331
Yeah, no, I... I'll...
I'll come back later.

54:55.465 --> 54:56.401
Yeah, no worries.

55:56.327 --> 55:57.462
Brilliant.

56:04.034 --> 56:06.938
Um, I thought we paid this.

56:07.971 --> 56:09.306
I'll do it now.

56:09.440 --> 56:13.242
Um, they've just charged us £50
for it being late.

56:13.376 --> 56:15.679
I told you twice
to do this last week.

56:15.813 --> 56:18.548
Rather than tell me, why don't
you just do it yourself?

56:18.681 --> 56:20.450
Oh, sure, yeah.

56:20.583 --> 56:23.753
No, no, I... I'll just pull
13-hour-a-day shifts,

56:23.887 --> 56:25.289
and on top of that

56:25.422 --> 56:27.657
I'll just add some more things
to my list, and...

56:27.791 --> 56:29.059
Don't think
I wouldn't love

56:29.193 --> 56:31.762
to spend every day
runnin' around a farm.

56:31.894 --> 56:35.233
I work day and night
for this family.

56:37.067 --> 56:39.235
How foolish of me.

57:32.356 --> 57:33.491
Great.

57:59.583 --> 58:00.585
Brilliant.

58:03.586 --> 58:04.621
Red, it's yellow.

58:04.755 --> 58:06.490
Over.

58:06.623 --> 58:07.490
Yellow to red.

58:07.623 --> 58:09.525
Over.

58:09.659 --> 58:11.427
Go for Red.

58:11.561 --> 58:14.398
The target has been confirmed,
come to base now.

58:14.530 --> 58:16.799
Over.

58:16.932 --> 58:18.635
I repeat, come to base now.

58:18.768 --> 58:20.103
Over.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.175
Red?

58:25.643 --> 58:26.978
Red?

58:28.211 --> 58:31.081
Red, this is urgent.

58:46.697 --> 58:48.632
Hmm, temperature's up.

58:48.764 --> 58:50.000
How do you feel?

58:50.132 --> 58:53.002
Vision okay?
You feel faint?

58:53.137 --> 58:55.006
My feet hurt.

58:55.139 --> 58:56.907
Your feet?

58:58.242 --> 59:02.179
Oh my gosh, Iris,
your feet are so swollen!

59:02.311 --> 59:04.313
I'll call the doctor again.

59:04.447 --> 59:08.152
I don't wanna go back
to the hospital, I hate it.

59:16.693 --> 59:21.431
I know you don't feel like it,
but you need to eat something.

59:25.668 --> 59:28.504
Hmm, where's Iris gone?

59:28.637 --> 59:31.840
She's disappeared,
just this lumpy thing in here.

59:31.974 --> 59:33.476
Stop it.

59:33.610 --> 59:34.877
That's funny.

59:35.012 --> 59:38.516
I could've sworn
I heard something.

59:38.648 --> 59:39.949
Nope, don't think so.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.318
Stop it!

59:42.652 --> 59:46.088
Why is Daddy sleepin'
on the sofa?

59:46.222 --> 59:49.927
Oh, um, you know,

59:50.059 --> 59:51.894
I like to kick
in my sleep sometimes.

59:52.027 --> 59:53.262
Poor daddy.

59:54.931 --> 59:57.233
I'm tired.

Well, that's not very nice.

01:03:32.949 --> 01:03:37.386
Oh, what dreadful weather!

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:39.623
I don't feel well.

01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:42.326
Come here.

01:03:44.327 --> 01:03:47.364
Nope, no temperature.

01:03:47.496 --> 01:03:49.832
My heart hurts.

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:55.704
Oh dear.

01:03:55.838 --> 01:04:00.777
Oh dear, dear, dear,
no, not good.

01:04:00.909 --> 01:04:03.545
Not good at all.

01:04:03.679 --> 01:04:05.013
Really?

01:04:05.148 --> 01:04:09.753
Sounds like your heart's fallen
all the way down to your tummy.

01:04:11.054 --> 01:04:12.923
Had any nice dreams lately?

01:04:13.056 --> 01:04:14.758
What's the point?

01:04:17.893 --> 01:04:20.262
Do you think the colors
would have given up?

01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:21.865
It doesn't work.

01:04:21.998 --> 01:04:23.099
It does.

01:04:23.233 --> 01:04:24.702
And how can you be so sure?

01:04:24.835 --> 01:04:26.869
I hate Mum,
she's always shoutin' at dad

01:04:27.003 --> 01:04:30.806
and she's makin' him
sleep on the sofa.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:31.807
Oh, darling.

01:04:33.643 --> 01:04:37.313
Mummy and Daddy
love you very much.

01:04:37.447 --> 01:04:39.182
You're a lucky girl
to have parents

01:04:39.315 --> 01:04:42.418
that love you so.

01:04:42.552 --> 01:04:45.355
The power's rubbish anyways.

01:04:45.489 --> 01:04:48.657
It absolutely isn't, Iris.

01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:50.960
Do you really think it works?

01:04:51.094 --> 01:04:53.829
I know it does.

01:04:55.864 --> 01:04:58.767
Long time ago,
there was a little girl,

01:04:58.902 --> 01:05:04.240
about your age,
and just like you right now,

01:05:04.373 --> 01:05:08.110
she had to face
some scary times.

01:05:08.244 --> 01:05:11.381
But this little girl,
she didn't have a grandma

01:05:11.514 --> 01:05:15.717
or even a mummy
that she could talk to.

01:05:15.851 --> 01:05:20.089
There was just her
and the others.

01:06:17.047 --> 01:06:18.614
All right,
everyone out of bed.

01:06:18.748 --> 01:06:20.217
Come on, leave everything.

01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:25.454
Maisie!

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:29.393
Come on, slow poke.

01:06:29.525 --> 01:06:30.659
One, two, three,
come with me, four.

01:06:30.793 --> 01:06:32.663
All right, go on. Come on.

01:06:32.795 --> 01:06:35.064
All right, come with me,
come with me.

01:06:35.197 --> 01:06:36.298
Here we go.

01:06:36.432 --> 01:06:38.101
All right, it's gonna be fine.

01:06:42.938 --> 01:06:44.473
What about Mister Augustus?

01:06:44.608 --> 01:06:46.242
No, we don't have time!

01:06:48.445 --> 01:06:49.446
Come on.

01:06:49.579 --> 01:06:50.847
It's all right,
it's all right.

01:06:55.619 --> 01:06:57.187
Let's go.

01:07:03.559 --> 01:07:04.727
Jenny and Simon.

01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.535
Come on.
Jenny, come.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.242
Jenny.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:21.077
Simon.

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:22.110
Here we go.

01:07:32.088 --> 01:07:33.390
Just stay here.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.961
We'll wait for the all-clear.

01:07:38.094 --> 01:07:39.061
Before you know it,

01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:41.364
we'll be curled back up
in our beds again.

01:07:43.032 --> 01:07:47.771
They all just wanted the war
to end, to be safe,

01:07:47.903 --> 01:07:51.041
to play with their brothers
and sisters again,

01:07:51.173 --> 01:07:54.543
and, of course,
she wanted to dance.

01:07:54.677 --> 01:07:58.614
There's no way
they got out alive.

01:07:58.748 --> 01:08:01.984
It got a lot worse,
believe me.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.587
They must be
right overhead, Miss.

01:08:47.296 --> 01:08:49.663
I think
they hit the power station.

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:54.136
But if they are that close,
they'll be past us soon.

01:08:57.974 --> 01:08:59.675
The roof's going to come down!

01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:22.399
So what happened?

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:29.171
Well, Miss Shaw
told tell them a story,

01:09:29.305 --> 01:09:34.076
a wise tale
about how the colors

01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:38.081
defeated the evil queen
of darkness.

01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:39.215
The story!

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:40.617
Yes.

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.984
And then,

01:09:42.118 --> 01:09:45.587
each one closed their eyes,

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.090
took a deep breath,

01:09:48.224 --> 01:09:53.261
and imagined
the war would end,

01:09:53.395 --> 01:09:59.670
and wished
that they would be found.

01:09:59.802 --> 01:10:03.539
And they hoped,
and they prayed

01:10:03.672 --> 01:10:07.409
as hard as they could.

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:09.512
And it was!

01:10:09.645 --> 01:10:13.715
Years later, everyone said
what miracle of the blitz

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:16.719
it was that
they were even found!

01:10:16.853 --> 01:10:19.489
No search parties
were sent for,

01:10:19.622 --> 01:10:21.990
no instructions
were given to help them.

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:25.494
I mean, nobody even knew
where they were.

01:10:25.628 --> 01:10:29.265
But by luck, by chance,

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:33.670
some would say
a little bit of magic,

01:10:33.802 --> 01:10:35.904
they were found.

01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:39.508
And did the girl
ever become a dancer?

01:10:39.641 --> 01:10:41.444
Oh, yes.

01:10:41.578 --> 01:10:46.382
Many years, she performed
all over the world.

01:10:46.515 --> 01:10:47.750
In fact,

01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:50.185
her granddaughter
this very day

01:10:50.319 --> 01:10:54.222
is thinking of following
in her footsteps.

01:10:54.356 --> 01:10:55.324
Me?

01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:57.126
The girl in the story was you!

01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.327
Yes.

01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:00.663
So it really does work.

01:11:00.796 --> 01:11:02.297
Yes.

01:11:10.774 --> 01:11:12.575
I want you to have this.

01:11:14.342 --> 01:11:15.677
It was mine.

01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:17.814
From the orphanage?

01:11:19.949 --> 01:11:21.483
Thanks, Gran.

01:11:26.055 --> 01:11:28.524
What was it like
being in an orphanage,

01:11:28.658 --> 01:11:30.293
and not having mum and dad?

01:11:30.426 --> 01:11:32.128
Tell me some stories.

01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:35.198
I think that's enough
for one night, don't you?

01:11:35.331 --> 01:11:38.367
But, Gran,
I'm not even tired.

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:42.806
Well, I think we'll keep them
closed just in case.

01:11:42.939 --> 01:11:45.709
I'll tell you some more stories
tomorrow night.

01:11:52.247 --> 01:11:54.283
Look at this one.
Look what the tide brought in.

01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:56.185
Oh. Here's the bucket.

01:11:56.319 --> 01:11:57.620
Now, put 'em in,
put 'em in, put 'em in.

01:11:57.753 --> 01:11:59.889
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:12:00.023 --> 01:12:01.557
Yep, now that'll go
in the bucket.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.795
Look at this one.

01:12:05.927 --> 01:12:07.095
- Oh.
- Oh, nice.

01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:08.763
Look, Iris,
you got wet shoes now.

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:13.103
Go on, go on.

01:12:13.235 --> 01:12:14.569
No. Stop.

01:13:29.712 --> 01:13:31.314
Oh, you all right there, James?

01:13:32.948 --> 01:13:35.116
Yeah, only a couple today.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:36.351
Oh, if you scrub that
any harder,

01:13:36.485 --> 01:13:37.354
the paint will come off.

01:13:38.487 --> 01:13:39.822
What?

01:13:39.956 --> 01:13:41.958
Well, I... I meant the boat.

01:13:44.527 --> 01:13:45.862
Oh.

01:13:46.828 --> 01:13:48.164
Thanks.

01:13:49.497 --> 01:13:50.932
How's Iris?

01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:57.707
Yeah, uh, no, she's...
she's okay.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.377
It's her birthday next week,
so we're kinda focusing on that.

01:14:07.516 --> 01:14:09.485
If there's anything
I can do...

01:15:01.904 --> 01:15:04.040
130 over 80.

01:15:04.172 --> 01:15:06.542
110 over...

01:15:08.978 --> 01:15:11.014
...63.

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.853
That's not right.

01:15:17.987 --> 01:15:20.023
I'm calling Dr. Steadman.

01:15:20.788 --> 01:15:23.792
No, Mum, I'm fine.

01:15:23.926 --> 01:15:25.360
James, I'm callin' him.

01:15:25.493 --> 01:15:27.195
Yeah.

01:15:27.329 --> 01:15:28.465
No.

01:15:29.466 --> 01:15:32.269
I wanna be home
for tomorrow.

01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:33.802
Oh, honey.

01:15:33.935 --> 01:15:36.773
Darling,
it's too much of a risk.

01:15:36.905 --> 01:15:39.307
But, daddy, it's okay.

01:15:39.442 --> 01:15:42.078
I know I'm gonna get
a new heart.

01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:44.213
Why is that?

01:15:44.346 --> 01:15:47.082
I asked the universe for one.

01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:15.912
Look at you.

01:16:16.045 --> 01:16:17.680
Foolin' around
with that stupid guitar

01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:19.815
and makin' a fool of yourself.

01:17:25.247 --> 01:17:26.615
Look at this one!

01:18:11.092 --> 01:18:12.461
Hello.

01:18:20.103 --> 01:18:22.503
Iris!

01:18:22.637 --> 01:18:24.606
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, sweetie.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.641
We're gonna make you
feel better, okay?

01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:27.643
This is it.

01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:28.978
- Come on.
- What's happening?

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:30.778
- Come on.
- Where's Gran?

01:18:30.912 --> 01:18:31.946
Oh, you'll see her later.

01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:33.382
Come on.

01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:35.049
- Mister Augustus!
- There's no time!

01:18:35.184 --> 01:18:36.252
Come on.

01:20:15.184 --> 01:20:16.385
Hi, Rick.
Bit late, isn't it?

01:20:16.519 --> 01:20:18.020
Here, you gotta have this.

01:20:22.256 --> 01:20:25.761
This little girl, she's got...
she wants to be a ballerina.

01:20:25.895 --> 01:20:29.132
That's an entry form.
You just gotta see it, please.

01:20:30.765 --> 01:20:32.467
Okay.

01:20:32.601 --> 01:20:34.304
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:35.738 --> 01:20:38.407
Do you wanna get coffee
sometime as well,

01:20:38.539 --> 01:20:39.943
with me, anytime?

01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:44.881
Sure.

01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:49.351
Goodbye.

01:20:49.484 --> 01:20:50.652
All right.

01:21:19.047 --> 01:21:20.448
It won't be long now.

01:21:20.582 --> 01:21:24.253
Just try and relax,
you're in safe hands, okay?

01:21:24.386 --> 01:21:25.554
Okay, we're ready for her.

01:21:27.489 --> 01:21:29.358
Okay, sweetie,
we have to go now.

01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:32.127
Be a good brave girl
for Mummy, okay?

01:21:32.261 --> 01:21:33.830
Where's Gran?

01:21:33.962 --> 01:21:35.163
You'll see her later.

01:21:35.297 --> 01:21:36.465
We'll be right outside.

01:21:36.599 --> 01:21:38.301
It'll be over
before you know it.

01:21:38.434 --> 01:21:39.969
We love you very much.

01:21:40.101 --> 01:21:41.970
Yeah, I love you so much, Iris.

01:21:42.104 --> 01:21:44.240
You're my super trooper.

01:21:44.372 --> 01:21:45.641
You'll have to say
your goodbyes now.

01:21:45.774 --> 01:21:47.408
We'll take good care of her,
don't worry.

01:21:47.542 --> 01:21:49.310
- Yeah.
- Be brave.

01:21:49.444 --> 01:21:51.046
- Mummy will see you soon.
- Yeah.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.181
Oh, wait.

01:21:52.314 --> 01:21:53.782
Almost forgot.

01:21:53.916 --> 01:21:55.250
Look, who's here.

01:21:55.384 --> 01:21:57.353
I figured you'd want him.

01:22:34.055 --> 01:22:36.257
Mister Augustus said
it'll be fine.

01:22:36.391 --> 01:22:39.461
Now, Iris, I'm going to put
something around your face.

01:22:39.595 --> 01:22:41.664
It's not gonna hurt you.

01:22:41.796 --> 01:22:44.265
Okay, now, Iris,
close your eyes.

01:22:44.399 --> 01:22:45.500
Deep breaths.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:35.684
So this is my situation.

01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:36.952
I was born
with a heart condition

01:23:37.086 --> 01:23:39.454
called restrictive
cardiomyopathy

01:23:39.587 --> 01:23:42.090
which means my heart
doesn't work so well.

01:25:17.152 --> 01:25:18.820
I know that I might
not be the very best

01:25:18.953 --> 01:25:22.224
I can be right now,
but I know I will very soon.

01:25:22.358 --> 01:25:23.525
When I get my new heart,

01:25:23.658 --> 01:25:25.259
I will dance
and practice every day

01:25:25.394 --> 01:25:28.063
to be the best
out of everyone in your show,

01:25:28.197 --> 01:25:30.166
'cause I'm Iris,
and I'm a warrior,

01:25:30.298 --> 01:25:33.368
and I'll never give up
on my dream to be a ballerina.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.175
- Daddy.
- Hey.

01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:15.244
Oh.

01:26:15.377 --> 01:26:18.480
You look so beautiful!

01:26:18.613 --> 01:26:20.447
So beautiful.

01:26:20.582 --> 01:26:21.550
Nervous?

01:26:21.684 --> 01:26:23.118
No.

01:26:23.251 --> 01:26:24.219
Are you nervous?

01:26:26.322 --> 01:26:28.489
Is it that obvious?

01:26:28.623 --> 01:26:29.557
Where's Mummy?

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.559
Coming from work.

01:26:31.693 --> 01:26:32.961
From work?

01:26:33.095 --> 01:26:34.563
What, she's not here yet?

01:26:35.898 --> 01:26:37.900
She's never gonna make it.

01:26:38.033 --> 01:26:39.402
She doesn't finish work
till 5:00

01:26:39.534 --> 01:26:41.103
and then she's gonna get caught
in rush-hour traffic.

01:26:41.235 --> 01:26:44.139
She said she'll be here,
she will.

01:26:47.443 --> 01:26:49.578
You are right.

01:26:49.712 --> 01:26:51.513
You're right.

01:26:51.646 --> 01:26:53.814
Just in time.

01:26:53.948 --> 01:26:56.183
Wow, Iris, look at you.

01:26:56.318 --> 01:26:57.918
You look beautiful.

01:26:58.052 --> 01:27:00.389
I brought water and supplies.

01:27:00.521 --> 01:27:02.056
How do you feel, okay?

01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:03.524
- I can do...
- You don't have to do this

01:27:03.658 --> 01:27:05.661
- if you feel...
- I can do it, Mum.

01:27:05.793 --> 01:27:08.663
I'm doing it for both of us.

01:27:08.797 --> 01:27:11.532
Yes, you can,
my little warrior.

01:27:11.667 --> 01:27:13.869
I found a straggler.

01:27:16.503 --> 01:27:18.039
Hey, Christopher.

01:27:18.172 --> 01:27:19.407
Nice shoes.

01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:23.645
I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

01:27:23.779 --> 01:27:26.415
Not that you'll need it.

01:27:26.547 --> 01:27:27.581
This is for you.

01:27:27.716 --> 01:27:28.817
Thanks.

01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:37.224
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:43.931
Remember, posture,
with those toes,

01:27:44.064 --> 01:27:46.701
you'll be in the Royal Ballet
in no time.

01:27:46.835 --> 01:27:48.069
At this age?

01:27:48.203 --> 01:27:49.737
You have to start young
or before you know it,

01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:51.007
you're over the hill.

01:27:54.475 --> 01:27:56.177
It's time.
