<i>[Ignacio] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:04.097
You get my e-mails?

00:04.170 --> 00:07.162
Yeah, I was busy... with my boyfriend.

00:08.041 --> 00:12.034
- Do we have attorney-client privilege?
- That only works if I'm your lawyer.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.945
For now, you got something
stronger. My word.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.143
Marc booked your flight for Paris.
You leave tonight at 9:00.

00:18.218 --> 00:21.779
I want Justin in return.
I want to see my son.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.187
You need to find
what it is you're looking for.

00:24.257 --> 00:27.158
I just know, now, that it's not me.

00:27.227 --> 00:31.288
[Woman] I think it's time for Fey
Sommers to come out of seclusion.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.854
Fey?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.693
[Elevator bell dings]

00:44.144 --> 00:45.975
[Telephone rings]

00:46.046 --> 00:47.741
Betty Suarez here.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.616
No, Betty Suarez here!
At home. An hour ago.

00:52.685 --> 00:55.586
Daniel hasn't left yet.
He's doing paperwork.

00:55.655 --> 00:59.386
The lawyer's gonna be here any minute
to go over Dad's immigration case!

00:59.459 --> 01:03.020
- I'll get home as soon as I can.
- What about shopping for Thanksgiving?

01:03.096 --> 01:05.963
Hilda, I will get it done!
Look, I gotta go.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.761
- [Phone clicks]
- [Betty sighs]

01:07.834 --> 01:11.702
Since I started she acts like, all of a
sudden, I don't care about our family.

01:11.771 --> 01:16.037
I always shop for Thanksgiving, and then
my father and I cook the meal together.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.600
It's our tradition
since my mother passed away.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.108
I'm sorry, you were
looking at me and saying things.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.377
- I wasn't really listening.
- Never mind.

01:24.451 --> 01:27.682
You've got big plans tomorrow
with this guy you've been seeing?

01:27.754 --> 01:28.982
What makes you say that?

01:29.055 --> 01:31.353
You keep walking past
Daniel's office saying

01:31.491 --> 01:34.255
you've got big plans
with this guy you've been seeing.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.617
Not anymore.

01:36.696 --> 01:40.860
Jerk called. Says he has to spend
Thanksgiving with his wife and kids.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.529
I'm like, grow a pair!
I am so over men. They all suck.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.302
Where's Marc?

01:48.608 --> 01:50.235
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.574
Hey, what are you still doing here?

01:52.645 --> 01:56.638
The high priestess needs her outfit
altered for some dinner she's going to.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.581
What time do I need to be at your place?

01:58.651 --> 02:00.949
- Around three.
- Is that the time we're eating,

02:01.020 --> 02:04.922
or the time that that delightful nephew
of yours is putting on his production of

02:04.991 --> 02:07.551
<i>- Thanksgiving, the Musical?
- We're eating at six.</i>

02:07.627 --> 02:09.253
I'll see you at six, then.

02:16.469 --> 02:20.064
Um... The phones
stopped ringing a while ago.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.472
Looks like everybody's
gone for the holiday.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.739
- Do you think maybe I could...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

02:26.846 --> 02:27.972
OK.

02:28.047 --> 02:31.175
You haven't seen Sofia
up here today, right?

02:33.119 --> 02:35.349
OK, and there's no calls?

02:37.090 --> 02:38.921
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no. I don't care.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.755
She's got a boyfriend, right?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.557
Who she never happened
to mention, I might add.

02:43.630 --> 02:47.122
If you're serious about a guy,
you'd be talking about him all the time.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.600
You're always going on
about that guy Wilbur.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.765
Walter. Daniel, are you OK?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.207
No! I've spent the day waiting
by the phone, checking my e-mail.

02:57.277 --> 02:59.768
It's like I'm this close
to splitting a Cobb salad

02:59.846 --> 03:02.474
with Sarah Jessica Parker
and talking about shoes.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.717
I really miss that show.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.547
So whatcha doing tomorrow?

03:12.625 --> 03:15.651
I have to drag my well-toned ass
up to Schenectady,

03:15.728 --> 03:17.719
eat cranberry sauce
in the shape of a can

03:17.797 --> 03:21.028
and tell my family about
"my girlfriend who lives up in Canada."

03:21.100 --> 03:24.467
- Wanna blow 'em off and hang out?
- Tempting. What're you thinking?

03:24.537 --> 03:27.836
We meet here at nine. I bring champagne,
you bring the orange juice

03:27.907 --> 03:30.535
and we watch the parade
from Wilhelmina's window.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.841
You mean try on couture gowns
and Xerox our naughty bits?

03:33.913 --> 03:36.177
- Of course.
- I am so in.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.312
French cuff or no?

03:40.386 --> 03:42.445
- No.
- I'd go with the cuff.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.854
You want to live my life?
Pay my bills.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.324
Hi... Ooh! Sassy.

03:48.094 --> 03:52.121
Uh... Louis from Armani called, not
happy with his placement in the issue.

03:52.198 --> 03:56.225
Dr. Levy needs to move
your teeth whitening to Tuesday,

03:56.302 --> 04:00.068
and... oh, Nico said to tell you
she's coming in town for Thanksgiving.

04:00.139 --> 04:03.267
What? She told me last week
she was staying at school.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.504
I can't change my plans
at the last minute.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.341
I have the Versace party to go to.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.675
Ouch!

04:09.148 --> 04:10.877
It's a work obligation.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.942
I can't shirk my responsibilities
just to sit home and have

04:14.020 --> 04:18.353
a Very Brady Thanksgiving.
She'll just have to understand.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.221
- What're you staring at?
- Nothing.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.818
You're gonna cuff that, right?

04:27.734 --> 04:30.931
OK, don't forget, your dad
has a brunch at 2:00 p.m.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.494
In the executive dining room.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.563
- I'm gonna pass on that.
- What?

04:35.842 --> 04:37.673
- Slimming.
- Thanks, Marc!

04:37.744 --> 04:39.837
You have to go. It's your family.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.380
Come on!
It's not some intimate gathering.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.178
My father invites his editors
so everyone can tell him

04:45.251 --> 04:46.479
what a genius he is.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.952
And this year my mother'll be
fresh out of detox,

04:49.022 --> 04:52.287
stealing the olives out of martini
glasses and sucking them dry

04:52.358 --> 04:54.553
in the janitor's closet. No thanks.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.757
Knock, knock.
Oh, am I interrupting something?

04:57.830 --> 04:59.821
- Oh, hey...
- No!

04:59.899 --> 05:01.560
- Betty was just leaving.
- I was!

05:01.634 --> 05:03.534
- Bye.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

05:03.603 --> 05:04.900
Happy Thanksgiving.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.572
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.443
So what's new?

05:11.511 --> 05:13.604
Um...

05:13.680 --> 05:15.875
I met this girl, had some fun,

05:15.948 --> 05:19.406
I found out she has a boyfriend
she didn't tell me about.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.454
Wow. She sounds like a bitch.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.348
I'm sorry, Daniel.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.185
I didn't know we were
going to do what we did.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.526
And things just got out of control.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.727
I was actually hoping
that we could skip to the part

05:36.803 --> 05:39.670
where we move on
and we try to be friends?

05:39.739 --> 05:43.835
- I'd really like to be your friend.
- Me, too.

[Chuckling]

05:59.459 --> 06:01.950
I'll see you at your
father's brunch tomorrow.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.360
Oh, you're going?
But you RSVP'd "no."

06:04.430 --> 06:06.398
I mean, not that I checked.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.491
Well, I was supposed to go skiing,

06:08.568 --> 06:11.264
but now I have to get back
by Friday, so, whatever.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.737
Sounds like fun.
You're gonna be there, right?

06:13.806 --> 06:16.570
Oh, yeah, I'll be there.
I mean, it's my family, right?

06:16.642 --> 06:18.610
Thanksgiving without family'd be...

06:19.645 --> 06:22.876
...Thursday.
- Great. Because I'm bringing Hunter.

06:22.949 --> 06:27.682
And, you know, in a weird way,
I think you two will really get along.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.746
Great. Yeah. Hunter.
I can't wait to meet him.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.518
Hunter! Hunter.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.322
I can't stop saying his name.
I love him already!

06:35.395 --> 06:36.794
See you there.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.952
Hey, nice turkey.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.988
You making one for everybody?

07:03.055 --> 07:05.888
[Leah] So you really invited your ex
for Thanksgiving?

07:05.958 --> 07:09.860
- Look who took her grown-up pill.
- Well, he is Justin's father,

07:09.929 --> 07:13.057
although these days a freakin'
Petri dish can be a father. Right?

07:13.132 --> 07:15.566
So when did you two
get divorced, anyway?

07:15.635 --> 07:20.038
You have to be married to get divorced.
No, this is the classic boy meets girl,

07:20.106 --> 07:22.939
boy knocks girl up,
boy loses girl's number.

07:23.009 --> 07:26.035
Throw in a glass slipper and
you've got a hell of a fairy tale.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.137
- Exactly.
- I'm home! I'm sorry.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.806
You go over your case with Leah?

07:29.882 --> 07:32.646
- An hour ago.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't get off of work.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.084
And you missed my pageant at school.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.918
I know, Justin, but there was
no one to cover my phones.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.891
Well, it was awesome.
I was the only Pilgrim

07:40.960 --> 07:42.985
- that could do jazz hands.
- Jazz what?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.326
- Jazz hands.
- Hands.

07:45.398 --> 07:49.698
Oh, well, I want to hear all about this
as soon as I get home from shopping.

07:53.172 --> 07:56.232
Oh, Hi. You must be Leah,
I'm Betty, I'm so sorry...

07:56.309 --> 08:00.109
- What'd you do? You went to the market?
- That doesn't sound like a "Thank you."

08:00.179 --> 08:02.511
Hilda, I told you
that I'd do the shopping.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.574
Since she started this job,
she has no more time anymore.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.984
I have time. I'm still doing
all the cooking with Dad tomorrow.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.149
What if they call tomorrow
with some fashion emergency?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.420
They've lowered the hemlines! Red alert!

08:14.494 --> 08:17.657
Wait, you didn't even get
the stuff to make the bunuelos.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.324
Why do you insist on
making those every year?

08:20.399 --> 08:23.926
No one ever eats them. Last year we
had to use them to crack open walnuts.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.699
Because Mom made them
every year, Hilda.

08:26.772 --> 08:30.833
It's a tradition.
And that was the best turkey they had?

08:30.910 --> 08:32.775
No, that is the last turkey they had.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.972
You were this close
to stuffing a brisket.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.283
Oh, I have so much to do!

08:39.352 --> 08:42.582
I haven't started to cook
and I've still got to go to the airport.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.089
- All the kids are coming home.
- Tell me about it.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.751
We're having our three boys
and their girlfriends.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.352
I have no idea where
we're gonna put these people.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.262
Well, we see them
three times a year. It's worth it.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.908
Will you stop looking at me like the
Ghost of Thanksgiving Yet to Come?

09:04.977 --> 09:06.842
Good night.

09:07.213 --> 09:13.152
I see an old woman, all alone
at a Thanksgiving table set for one.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.804
<i>Ciao, tesoro, it's Wilhelmina.</i>

09:37.944 --> 09:39.206
Yes.

09:39.278 --> 09:43.408
Listen, something came up
and I won't be able to make it tomorrow.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.978
Nico's coming home. Yes.

09:51.991 --> 09:55.893
<i>[Donna Summer: Bad Girls]</i>

10:02.768 --> 10:06.704
Looks like I'm not the only one doing
last-minute Thanksgiving shopping.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.306
A carton of cigarettes
and a bottle of vodka?

10:10.376 --> 10:12.469
You have your traditions,
I have mine.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.079
So, having some big blowout today?

10:16.148 --> 10:18.116
No, Gina, just the family.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.277
I thought you would've gone all out.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.550
I mean, you never know
who won't be around next Thanksgiving.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.591
What is that supposed to mean?

10:25.658 --> 10:28.286
Come on, it's a small neighborhood,
people talk.

10:28.361 --> 10:31.626
Everyone knows about
your pop's immigration problem.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.961
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.297
Hey, you want to keep it quiet, fine.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.998
But in the spirit of the holiday,
I think I should tell you...

10:40.072 --> 10:42.597
Watch out for that lawyer
I saw leaving your place.

10:42.675 --> 10:46.202
- Oh, really? And why is that?
- Leah Stillman is bad news.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.736
I know someone who knows someone
who knows Donna Spadaro in Astoria.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.306
Leah promised to get her
custody of her kids,

10:52.385 --> 10:54.853
and all she did was
steal her money and take off.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.684
Yeah, well,
Hilda found Leah, and I trust her.

10:57.757 --> 11:01.887
- Leah's not gonna rip us off.
- Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

11:01.961 --> 11:06.694
Oh, and tell your father I wish him
a very happy Thanksgiving.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.689
<i>[Woman on phone] What city?</i>

11:31.757 --> 11:35.249
Hi, in Astoria.
A Donna Spadaro, please.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.659
<i>- [Cell phone ringing]
- Hold for the number.</i>

11:38.397 --> 11:40.490
Shoot! Sorry, never mind.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.332
- Hi, Daniel, it's me.
- Betty, I need you. Now!

11:43.402 --> 11:46.269
- Where are you?
- At the loft. Hurry, it's an emergency.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.104
- Hello?
- What's going on?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.610
I gotta go.
Daniel just called, he needs me.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.873
- It's Thanksgiving!
- I know, I know.

11:54.947 --> 11:57.939
Unbelievable.
What about cooking dinner with Dad?

12:00.653 --> 12:02.484
Will you tell him I'm sorry?

12:09.495 --> 12:12.157
[Cheering]

12:13.265 --> 12:16.029
Look, it's the Eva Longoria float!

12:16.102 --> 12:17.831
We love you, Eva!

12:17.903 --> 12:19.928
What if she has hidden cameras in here?

12:20.005 --> 12:23.805
Trust me, if she had cameras in here,
I'd have been fired a long time ago.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.640
Hey, what's that weird float over there?

12:28.547 --> 12:31.380
That's not a float, that's Betty.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.751
You called me
to help you pick out a shirt?

12:36.822 --> 12:38.312
This is your big emergency?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.517
You rather I swallowed
a bottle of pills?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.460
It took you 45 minutes to get here.
I'd be dead already.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.759
I left my family on Thanksgiving!

12:45.831 --> 12:48.527
I had to cut across the parade route!

12:48.601 --> 12:50.796
I almost got run over by
those Queer Eye guys

12:50.870 --> 12:54.306
riding a giant Pilgrim.
OK, that came out wrong.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.136
Betty, this is an emergency.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.336
I have to sit across from
Sofia and her boyfriend at brunch.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.140
I've got to look good.

13:01.981 --> 13:06.077
- Are you wearing cover-up?
- I have a pimple, all right? Go away!

13:06.152 --> 13:08.586
You know what? I am going away.
Goodbye, Daniel.

13:08.654 --> 13:12.590
No, no, no, wait, what about the shirts?
And we haven't even talked shoes yet.

13:12.658 --> 13:16.560
I know this might come as a surprise
to you, but I have a life too!

13:16.629 --> 13:19.154
And a family that counts on me a lot!

13:19.231 --> 13:21.699
They already think
that I put you in front of them.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.362
My dad's in legal problems, my sister
may have hired some shady lawyer,

13:25.437 --> 13:26.961
and it's up to me to fix it!

13:27.039 --> 13:29.200
I'm sorry if I don't think
that coming here

13:29.275 --> 13:32.972
and helping you pick out a shirt
to impress a girl is priority!

13:33.045 --> 13:34.740
And can I just say one more thing?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.112
No, I don't really
want to hear any more...

13:37.183 --> 13:41.176
- You're an amazing person, Daniel.
- Well, if you wanna blurt it out...

13:41.253 --> 13:43.016
You're smart, you're handsome,

13:43.088 --> 13:46.990
you were voted one of the top ten
bachelors in the city by some magazine.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.390
<i>Esquire.</i>

13:48.460 --> 13:52.453
I cannot believe that Sofia has you
questioning what a catch you are.

13:52.531 --> 13:56.524
Trust me, Hunter should be nervous
about sitting across from you.

13:56.602 --> 13:57.899
Thank you, Betty.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.829
- Go with the purple.
- Really?

14:01.907 --> 14:06.139
- I came all the way down here.
- OK, no, no, I'll wear the purple!

14:18.757 --> 14:21.954
Hey, Mom, is it OK if I sit
between Dad and Christina?

14:22.027 --> 14:25.053
I want to talk to her about
Stella McCartney's spring line.

14:25.130 --> 14:28.327
Great. I'm sure your father
will be very proud.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.496
Hilda, what're you doing?
Forget the spoon.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.664
Get your hands in there and feel it!

14:34.740 --> 14:37.072
I'm not feeling it!
I just got a manicure!

14:37.142 --> 14:40.441
<i>,Dios mio! Where's your sister?
She's got hands like meat hooks!</i>

14:40.512 --> 14:41.740
[Doorbell]

14:41.814 --> 14:45.113
- He's here! Dad's here!
- He actually showed, how about that?

14:45.184 --> 14:46.173
Don't.

14:46.252 --> 14:49.221
When we want him to leave,
we can tell him you're pregnant

14:49.288 --> 14:52.689
- and watch him run. He's good at that.
- Ancient history, Papi, OK?

14:52.758 --> 14:55.955
Let's not forget he's here
to give us the money

14:56.028 --> 14:58.553
to pay for a lawyer
so that you don't get deported.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.332
Wow, look at you, little man!

15:02.401 --> 15:03.629
Hi, Dad.

15:03.702 --> 15:06.500
What happened to that shrimp
I saw last time I was here?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.062
That was a year ago.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.445
- This is to make up for some lost time.
- Thanks.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.450
Thanks.

15:23.789 --> 15:25.814
Place never changes.

15:28.193 --> 15:31.890
Only thing missing is your old man
sleeping in front of the TV.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.933
Because the "old man"
is busy cooking dinner.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.404
Ignacio.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.667
You look good, man.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.345
Glad you could make it.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.260
Hi, are you Donna Spadaro?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.267
You don't know me, I'm Betty Suarez.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.429
- Yeah?
- I'm so sorry to be bothering you,

16:12.504 --> 16:14.972
but I wanted to ask you
about a lawyer you used.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.669
- A Leah Stillman?
- Are you from the Bar Association?

16:18.744 --> 16:20.735
I called you people three months ago.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.146
No, no, no, no.
I was just thinking about hiring her.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.444
Don't do it.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.849
I was fighting for custody of my kids.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.356
She tells me "No problem, I'll win."
Guarantees it.

16:31.423 --> 16:34.256
She files some papers,
takes all my money,

16:34.326 --> 16:37.523
- and I never hear from her again.
- Really?

16:37.596 --> 16:41.293
She promised she'd have them
home with me for Thanksgiving.

16:45.037 --> 16:49.440
- Hey, cool, a costume!
- Actually it's a uniform, man.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.841
- From the Jets. They're the best.
- Except for the Giants!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.406
Look at this,
I got you a helmet and football...

16:56.482 --> 16:57.972
Cool!

16:58.050 --> 17:03.113
Mom, look,
I'm the Phantom of the Opera!

17:05.958 --> 17:07.516
Hey, look who's here.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.984
- Hi, Santos.
- Sorry.

17:11.262 --> 17:14.289
So word is you're a big career girl now.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.596
Yeah, not that big. Where's Hilda?

17:16.667 --> 17:19.898
Hilda, I need to talk to you about...

17:19.972 --> 17:21.963
- Hi, Leah.
- Hi.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.566
She came over to pick up
the money Santos brought.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.703
Hope they pay you double time
for calling you in on a holiday.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.873
I should get going,
let you get to dinner.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.883
- I'll get you the rest of the money.
- Wait!

17:34.420 --> 17:37.753
I need to talk to you first. Upstairs.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.085
So...

17:41.460 --> 17:44.691
Oh, so now you're listening
to that skank Gina Gambarro?

17:44.763 --> 17:47.732
No, Hilda, I went to the woman's
house and I saw her myself.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.598
Maybe it's a different Leah.
Maybe they got the name wrong.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.570
I think that before we give
that woman all of our money...

17:53.639 --> 17:56.767
I think that this is about the fact
I found Leah and you didn't.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.811
- What?
- Oh, yeah, this is all making sense.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.870
I found the lawyer,
I'm saving Dad from being deported,

18:02.948 --> 18:05.007
I even helped Dad with the cooking.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.349
You're not the golden child anymore,
you can't deal with it.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.117
- Hilda, I am just trying to help.
- Well, maybe we don't need your help.

18:12.691 --> 18:16.627
You can't just get involved with the
family when it's convenient for you!

18:17.463 --> 18:20.489
So save your guilt
for someone who cares.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.772
<i>[Man] Ladies and gentlemen, the Dreams!</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:38.477
<i>We're your Dreamgirls, boys</i>

18:38.550 --> 18:40.347
<i>We'll make you happy</i>

18:40.419 --> 18:41.716
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

18:41.787 --> 18:47.384
<i>We're your Dreamgirls, boys
We'll always care</i>

18:47.459 --> 18:49.927
<i>We're your Dreamgirls</i>

18:49.995 --> 18:53.226
<i>Dreamgirls will never leave you</i>

18:53.298 --> 18:54.731
<i>No</i>

18:54.800 --> 18:57.030
<i>And all you have to do is dream</i>

18:57.102 --> 19:00.230
<i>Baby, we'll be there</i>

19:00.305 --> 19:01.670
[giggling]

19:01.740 --> 19:04.140
<i>Dream!</i>

19:04.209 --> 19:07.872
<i>Dreamgirls will help you
through the night</i>

19:10.349 --> 19:14.285
I wish I hadn't given up my lessons.
I could've been on Broadway.

19:14.353 --> 19:18.483
<i>You did date that chorus boy
from Miss Saigon. That kinda counts.</i>

19:18.557 --> 19:20.991
What's your biggest regret?

19:21.059 --> 19:24.085
Drinking a bottle of champagne
on an empty stomach.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.293
No, seriously. There's gotta be
something you wish you hadn't given up.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.860
Daniel.

19:31.937 --> 19:36.169
- Oh, sweetie.
- Oh, I'm so stupid.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.940
I knew what the rules were.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.614
- I just fell in love with him.
- Me, too.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.379
- What?
- What?

19:47.452 --> 19:51.388
Nothing. You look pretty.
You wanna try on some Armani?

19:59.498 --> 20:01.125
How are you doing, Mother?

20:03.235 --> 20:06.966
- Adjusting to life on the outside?
- I'm on my fourth club soda.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.008
- I pee every three minutes.
- Oh, you'll get through it.

20:10.075 --> 20:14.512
Hmm. I don't think I've ever been to one
of your father's work functions sober.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.447
I always thought there were
twice as many people.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.844
- Dad.
- Daniel.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.615
Drinking club soda too, very supportive.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.320
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.392
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.929
- [Sofia] You can't really...
- [man chuckling]

20:33.098 --> 20:35.191
I think it just got a little happier.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.030
- Hey, you.
- You must be Hunter.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.972
I've heard so much about you.
I really like that vest.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.340
<i>Oh, no, I'm Gordon Levine.
Editor of Tech Wiz.</i>

20:46.411 --> 20:48.936
- The 14th floor.
- Hunter's over there.

20:55.320 --> 20:59.586
Man, how're guys like us supposed
to score with someone like him around?

21:08.667 --> 21:11.465
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.373
[Ringing, click]

21:17.276 --> 21:18.766
Martha? It's Wilhelmina!

21:18.844 --> 21:21.039
Oh, hi, Wilhelmina!

21:21.113 --> 21:23.604
This is why I should always screen.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.776
So, Martha, happy Thanksgiving.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.150
Yeah, you, too.
Listen, I only have a second.

21:29.221 --> 21:33.157
My guests are arriving and I have to
hollow out pumpkins for the soup course.

21:33.225 --> 21:36.251
Yes, sorry to bother you,
I'm cooking a turkey and...

21:36.328 --> 21:37.795
You're cooking?

21:37.863 --> 21:40.331
Hey, maybe I could
run a fashion magazine.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.299
<i>It'll be like Freaky Friday.</i>

21:42.367 --> 21:44.892
Well, for your information,
I was doing fine

21:44.970 --> 21:48.838
until I noticed the bird
still had its luggage inside of it.

21:52.544 --> 21:55.707
Sorry, you want me
to put my hand where?

21:56.415 --> 21:59.145
...so then we realized,
it's not a Halloween costume,

21:59.217 --> 22:01.777
he really is a homeless guy!

22:02.220 --> 22:04.552
No, and he stole my purse!

22:06.692 --> 22:08.353
Yeah, that's funny.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.895
So where did
you two kids meet anyway?

22:10.962 --> 22:12.452
[Both] Ohhh.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.431
On a plane coming home from Kenya.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.333
Yeah, she was there for a photo shoot,
and I was working with the Peace Corps.

22:18.403 --> 22:22.271
He shared his complimentary nuts
with me, and then he cried

22:22.341 --> 22:24.502
<i>when they showed Bridget Jones's Diary.</i>

22:24.576 --> 22:27.272
- [Everyone ahhs]
- And I was hooked.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.439
So, you worked for the Peace Corps?

22:29.848 --> 22:32.316
Well, I figured there had to be
more to life than

22:32.384 --> 22:35.148
modeling and racing sports cars.
Well, you know.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.278
Yeah...

22:36.355 --> 22:40.086
[sighing] I spent a year setting up
this irrigation pump.

22:40.759 --> 22:44.855
Seeing these tribal kids' faces when
they saw fresh water the first time...

22:44.930 --> 22:48.058
- Oh, baby...
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

22:48.133 --> 22:52.695
Once I helped these kids
open up a hydrant on 76th street

22:52.771 --> 22:55.501
and they were just like, "Wow."

23:15.660 --> 23:17.218
Fey?

23:28.373 --> 23:32.571
- I saw her! Just now. She's alive.
- What are you talking about?

23:32.644 --> 23:36.876
- I saw Fey!
- No, you didn't. She's dead, Bradford.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.644
I can't believe you're doing this to me.

23:39.718 --> 23:42.881
I tried to go after her.
She just... disappeared.

23:43.688 --> 23:46.657
- Like some wishful hallucination.
- Are you OK?

23:47.659 --> 23:50.719
He's just had too much to drink.
I've got him.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.963
Ironic, isn't it?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.365
Hilda thinks I'm jealous?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.960
Because for once
she's carrying her weight?

23:59.037 --> 24:02.632
Maybe it is time the family
stopped depending on me for everything.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.403
I just asked where I should put my coat.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.968
I don't know. Ask Hilda.
She knows everything!

24:10.882 --> 24:12.679
Run while you can.

24:19.758 --> 24:23.319
- Not bad.
- Hello! Anyone home?

24:24.830 --> 24:26.457
I'm in the kitchen.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.791
The kitchen?
What, did you get lost or something?

24:31.870 --> 24:34.771
- What, are you staying for a month?
- Laundry.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.536
The washing machines
at the dorm are skanky.

24:37.609 --> 24:41.067
I'll throw in a load later.
OK, happy Thanksgiving.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.614
- I've got to run.
- Wait. Run?

24:44.115 --> 24:46.606
I'm meeting Sarah and Veronica
at the concert.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.016
What concert?

24:48.086 --> 24:50.054
We're going to see
Death Cab for Cutie.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.851
That's why I came into the city.
Why, what'd you think?

24:56.061 --> 24:59.758
- Nothing.
- I figured you'd have plans.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.698
I mean, you always have plans.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.166
And I do.
Of course I do.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.830
I have Donatella's
Thanksgiving party to go to.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.533
Which I am horribly late for.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.167
Mom, are you OK?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.906
Nico, I'm fine.

25:14.980 --> 25:18.381
I just made a little snack in case...

25:19.551 --> 25:21.678
Well, I'm sure it's not
very good anyway.

25:21.753 --> 25:24.187
I'm gonna go change.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.561
Hey, come try these on with me.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.830
If I do it by myself,
then I'm just a freak.

25:38.904 --> 25:41.372
You made me think of Daniel.
Now I'm depressed.

25:41.439 --> 25:44.237
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't get depressed.

25:44.309 --> 25:47.073
Up, up, up, up, up!
Get up, get up, get up! Up, up.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.170
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

25:49.247 --> 25:52.375
Betty makes 50 dollars a week
less than I do.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.578
Big news. I checked that out
her first week here.

25:55.654 --> 25:56.746
OK.

25:57.856 --> 26:01.417
Joelle, from Styles, got knocked up.
No idea who the father is.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.693
- [Scoffs]
- OK.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.262
I think Wilhelmina's a lesbian.

26:07.332 --> 26:08.856
- [Gasps] What?
- A big one!

26:08.934 --> 26:10.834
What are you talking about?

26:10.902 --> 26:14.497
She gets these calls all the time
from this woman, on her cell phone,

26:14.573 --> 26:17.406
and she kicks me out
when she calls. And we're like this!

26:17.475 --> 26:19.773
She had me bring her
her diaphragm to the Plaza

26:19.844 --> 26:22.244
when she was sleeping
with that guy from Texas.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.282
Wait, there goes my lesbian theory.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.909
So who is this woman?

26:30.855 --> 26:32.982
- [Neck cracking]
- Oh, my God!

26:33.725 --> 26:35.556
The pain is totally gone!

26:36.761 --> 26:39.161
- You're amazing!
- I told you.

26:40.031 --> 26:42.158
So you ready to get out of here?

26:42.233 --> 26:45.794
How about we burn some of this
turkey off and all go dancing later on.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.462
You know I can't dance.

26:47.539 --> 26:51.134
Oh, come on, take me to that place
that I love that you never take me to!

26:51.209 --> 26:53.734
- I can dance.
- What?

26:53.812 --> 26:55.746
I'm good at dancing!

26:55.814 --> 26:59.716
I love dancing! I think
the three of us should go dancing!

27:00.318 --> 27:02.309
I think that's a great idea!

27:06.191 --> 27:09.058
OK, well, I'm outta here.
Happy turkey day.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.062
Oh, Leah,
thanks again for everything.

27:12.130 --> 27:15.190
If you need me, I'll be
eating a turkey sandwich at my office

27:15.266 --> 27:18.064
getting your papers ready
to file for your green card.

27:18.136 --> 27:22.072
You really think
if we go to court I'll be OK?

27:22.140 --> 27:24.700
I've never lost a single case yet.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.108
Oh, really?
What about Donna Spadaro?

27:27.178 --> 27:28.167
- Betty!
- Excuse me?

27:28.246 --> 27:30.806
I'm sorry. I cannot
sit here and watch her lie to us!

27:30.882 --> 27:33.282
- Leah, I am so sorry...
- No, it's OK, it's OK.

27:33.351 --> 27:36.149
What exactly do you know
about Donna Spadaro's case?

27:36.221 --> 27:39.987
You couldn't have won her case because
you took her money and disappeared.

27:40.058 --> 27:43.858
It's true that I didn't win that case
because I quit before it went to trial.

27:43.928 --> 27:48.024
I wasn't interested in letting an
alcoholic gain custody of her children.

27:48.867 --> 27:49.856
An alcoholic?

27:49.934 --> 27:53.597
A week before her court date, Donna
left her three kids locked in her car

27:53.672 --> 27:56.140
in 90 degree heat while
she got bombed in a bar.

27:56.207 --> 27:59.699
The money that I "stole" from her
covered filing and court costs.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.473
I bet you didn't hear that part.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.181
No. I didn't.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.042
I'm sorry.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.816
Listen, maybe you should
find a new lawyer.

28:09.888 --> 28:13.688
- One that Betty approves of.
- No, no, you are the lawyer we want.

28:13.758 --> 28:16.659
Betty's on some power trip.
This has nothing to do with you.

28:16.728 --> 28:17.717
We need you.

28:17.796 --> 28:19.559
[Sighing]

28:19.631 --> 28:23.158
Yeah, and you know, you can't have
Thanksgiving dinner at the office.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.634
Why don't you come back
and have dinner with us?

28:25.704 --> 28:29.936
- We would love to have you.
- Well, it sure beats a sandwich.

28:30.008 --> 28:33.842
- You know what? I'd like that.
- Good.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.181
[Dialing tones]

28:41.152 --> 28:43.143
Meet me at the cemetery tonight.

28:44.689 --> 28:47.886
I'm going to find out
if she's alive one way or the other.

29:03.208 --> 29:06.006
Here was me afraid that spending
the holiday with my cat

29:06.077 --> 29:07.476
was going to be depressing.

29:08.079 --> 29:12.379
- Hilda, it's almost seven.
- Yeah, I know what time it is.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.918
Leah said she'll be here.
She'll be here.

29:16.287 --> 29:19.154
- Hello? It's Daniel.
- Of course it is.

29:21.025 --> 29:23.994
Why would you tell her
you can dance if you can't dance?

29:24.062 --> 29:25.689
- [Salsa music]
- I can dance!

29:25.764 --> 29:28.460
I just didn't know we were coming
to this kind of club.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.330
Betty, you gotta teach me.

29:30.401 --> 29:33.199
Daniel, I can't teach you
how to salsa on the phone.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.069
- What am I gonna do?
- OK, OK, OK, don't panic.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.371
Look, have you ever
even tried to mambo?

29:38.443 --> 29:42.106
Oh, yeah. Back at prep school
we had a big mambo contest every year.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.323
The basic idea of salsa
is that the man is trying

29:55.393 --> 29:58.089
to seduce the woman,
and the woman is pushing him away.

29:58.163 --> 30:01.690
So take your left foot
and you tap on the first beat.

30:01.766 --> 30:04.428
- Tap my left foot.
- Step forward with the same foot.

30:04.502 --> 30:05.628
OK, forward...

30:05.703 --> 30:08.570
You rock back on your right,
and bring your left to close.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.736
- Back on my right foot, left to close.
- And then you just reverse that.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.745
Just like that.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.714
Back on my right foot, left to close.
I think I can do that.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.579
Yeah. Look in a mirror.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.278
Are you biting your lower lip?

30:21.352 --> 30:24.150
- No.
- Yes you are. Don't do that.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.424
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.817
Put... it... down!

30:56.421 --> 30:58.150
How does she do that?

30:59.057 --> 31:02.151
- She's a little bit of a witch.
- Give or take a letter.

31:16.674 --> 31:19.666
Oh, be right back.
There you are.

31:19.744 --> 31:20.904
Isn't this place hot?

31:20.979 --> 31:23.743
Yeah. Makes me want to
tap on the beat with my left foot,

31:23.815 --> 31:26.147
rock back on my right.
Where's Hunter?

31:27.218 --> 31:29.015
He hates it that I drag him here.

31:29.087 --> 31:31.487
Poor guy.
Can't be great at everything, right?

31:31.556 --> 31:32.887
Hey, you. Come here.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.149
I need a mojito,
and then you're next.

32:06.224 --> 32:10.058
What the hell was that?
You told me you were a lousy dancer.

32:10.128 --> 32:13.222
I am. I was this close from
making the ballroom dancing finals

32:13.298 --> 32:17.234
in Vienna in '98 and blew it
with my paso doble. I stink.

32:21.239 --> 32:24.231
[Man] I still don't know why the hell
we had to do this tonight.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.402
I start my Christmas shopping tomorrow,

32:26.477 --> 32:29.810
and I want to know whether
I need to get a gift for Fey.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.578
[Man] Where the hell's the body?

32:34.652 --> 32:38.315
Save the tired theatrics.
You think I'm an idiot?

32:38.389 --> 32:42.621
- You've been working for her.
- Don't know what you're talking about.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.720
- Where is she?
- She's dead.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.424
Have it your way.

32:47.832 --> 32:51.495
What the hell?
You told someone about this?

32:51.569 --> 32:54.094
Mr. Green is a recent hire of mine.

32:54.172 --> 32:56.902
- To do what?
- To clean up messes.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.703
[Cracking knuckles]

33:14.459 --> 33:17.428
I just thought I'd
reheat the gravy since...

33:19.897 --> 33:21.159
What's wrong?

33:22.934 --> 33:25.801
I just tried Leah's cell. Twice.

33:26.871 --> 33:30.637
And her office number.
All disconnected.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.807
Go ahead and say it.
"I told you so."

33:46.624 --> 33:49.354
Get me the hell out of here.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.917
Daniel, we need to talk.

33:50.995 --> 33:53.520
Did Hunter save an orphan
from a burning building?

33:53.598 --> 33:55.623
Forget it, I'll read about it tomorrow.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.497
Come on, move over.

33:57.568 --> 34:00.196
You walked out of there all upset.

34:00.271 --> 34:03.502
I thought we were going to try to...

34:16.087 --> 34:18.385
Tell me that doesn't mean anything.

34:18.456 --> 34:21.447
I can't do this...

34:21.525 --> 34:24.552
Tell me and I'll drive away,
and when we pass by each other

34:24.629 --> 34:27.563
in the halls we can pretend
we don't even know each other.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.725
Of course you know
that meant something.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.292
Then what are we doing?
We're not in fifth grade.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.635
- Why are you with that guy?
- Because I love him.

34:37.341 --> 34:41.710
And this morning,
in his dresser, I found a ring.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.675
Is that what you want?

34:44.748 --> 34:46.341
- Yeah.
- Really?

34:47.717 --> 34:49.447
Yes.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.752
Don't let my motorcycle
and the Gucci sunglasses fool you.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.815
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

34:57.128 --> 35:01.622
I want the white picket fence
and lots of babies.

35:01.699 --> 35:05.635
And Hunter offers me that.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.127
You...

35:09.240 --> 35:12.471
I don't think you're
anywhere close to being there.

35:12.543 --> 35:15.376
I don't think you know me that well.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.938
Are you telling me that
you are ready to settle down?

35:23.387 --> 35:25.855
Come on, Daniel.

35:25.923 --> 35:29.791
This is where you stop me
from walking back into that club.

35:36.267 --> 35:37.928
[Door opens]

35:39.170 --> 35:40.501
[Door closes]

35:53.718 --> 35:54.810
What's all this?

35:54.886 --> 35:57.855
Well, turns out I don't have to
meet my friends for a while.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.720
Thought I'd have a snack.
You want to join me?

36:01.526 --> 36:04.962
- I told you I had plans.
- Come on. It's Donatella.

36:05.029 --> 36:08.294
There's gonna be seven models
fighting over a celery stick.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.665
Well, I suppose I have a minute.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.677
I can't believe you did all of this.

36:25.950 --> 36:28.180
It's nothing, I just...

36:28.252 --> 36:31.551
Mother, stop.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.419
Thank you.

36:36.761 --> 36:41.357
So how's everything at that
overpriced boarding school you're at?

36:41.432 --> 36:43.423
Tell me about your classes.

36:43.501 --> 36:46.595
Well, calculus sucks,
but psych is pretty cool.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.502
Oh, and I have this history teacher,

36:48.573 --> 36:51.269
you can have your headphones
in his class and he...

36:51.342 --> 36:54.277
- [Hilda] What are you doing?
- I'm making the bunuelos.

36:54.345 --> 36:57.712
Will you stop with those things?
Leah stole our money!

36:57.782 --> 37:01.513
We can't even go to the police because
we can't tell them Dad's illegal!

37:01.586 --> 37:06.023
It's still Thanksgiving, and we're still
a family. I'm making Mom's dessert.

37:07.358 --> 37:11.158
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I should've checked her out.

37:11.229 --> 37:15.427
It could've happened to anybody.
A lot of people believed her story.

37:15.499 --> 37:19.868
We were just so desperate, and I wanted
to come through for once, you know?

37:19.937 --> 37:21.871
To be the big hero.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.205
Well, you can help me finish these.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.410
Fine.

37:33.451 --> 37:37.046
- If anyone's to blame, it's me.
- Oh, shut up. I'm gonna hit you!

37:37.121 --> 37:39.885
I'm serious.
At least you've been trying to help.

37:39.957 --> 37:44.053
I didn't make it to Justin's pageant.
Maybe this stupid job isn't worth it.

37:44.128 --> 37:47.791
Well, you can't live your life
for your family, Betty.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.132
You've been taking care of us
since Mom died.

37:51.702 --> 37:54.830
Maybe it's time for us
to stop relying on you so much.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.806
Well, I like it that you rely on me.

38:00.878 --> 38:04.575
Taking care of the family
is the one thing I knew I could do.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.015
I wasn't ever gonna be "the pretty one."

38:08.152 --> 38:12.248
OK, look, maybe you don't
have to take care of everything.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.257
Maybe we're stronger than we think.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.793
Hell, I put these nails
in stuffing today.

38:18.929 --> 38:19.953
Big deal.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.300
I'm gonna kick your butt.

[Cell phone ringing]

38:25.236 --> 38:29.138
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- It's OK. Tell Daniel I said hi.

38:39.483 --> 38:43.544
[Gasps] Here it is.
I found it! Her cell phone bill!

38:43.621 --> 38:45.486
[Gasps] That's the number.

38:45.556 --> 38:49.014
Two a.m., six in the morning. Call.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.855
- I can't believe you're doing this!
- Shh!

<i>- [woman] Wilmont Surgical Center.
- Hi, this is Wilhelmina Slater.</i>

38:58.035 --> 39:01.493
<i>- Yes, I'll put you right through.
- She's putting me through.</i>

39:01.572 --> 39:03.699
- Through to who?
- I have no idea!

39:09.280 --> 39:12.272
Why are you calling me from the office?

39:14.452 --> 39:16.443
She knows we called from the office.

- Why did you just hang up on me?

39:37.641 --> 39:40.474
<i>- I didn't.
- Well, someone did.</i>

39:40.544 --> 39:42.569
And they were calling from your office.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.157
Excuse me. Hi, I'm Betty.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.194
- Somebody called me?
- Yeah, that was me. He's over there.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.391
- He OK?
- He was ordering scotch rocks.

40:01.465 --> 40:04.901
When he started ordering "crotch socks"
I figured I'd call someone.

40:04.969 --> 40:08.200
Yours was the number dialed
in his cell the most, so I figured...

40:08.272 --> 40:09.705
Thanks.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.506
- Hi.
- Betty?

40:18.582 --> 40:22.780
Hey. I wore that purple shirt
you picked out for me.

40:22.853 --> 40:24.980
I'm sure it looked great.

40:25.055 --> 40:27.285
You wanna get out of here?

40:28.259 --> 40:30.955
I couldn't tell her
what she wanted to hear, Betty.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.121
It wasn't a very good Thanksgiving.

40:36.567 --> 40:40.230
Yeah, I didn't have
a very good Thanksgiving either.
