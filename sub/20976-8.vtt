00:06.333 --> 00:09.033
- Have you ever, like,
looked down at a napkin

00:09.033 --> 00:11.300
and it had, like,
particles of bone?

00:13.033 --> 00:14.266
- That looks like
it's supposed to be

00:14.266 --> 00:15.433
for my vagina, not my nose.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.500
- It's a little small for that.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.166
- I have a small vagina.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.266
- Put your hands on your hips
and flex your muscle.

00:23.266 --> 00:26.133
- I've got these implants
up by my collar bone.

00:26.133 --> 00:28.533
My only solution
is to use duct tape.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.000
- Well, what do you
mean duct tape?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.300
- Yes.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.433
- Oh, my goodness.
A duct tape bra.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.533
- He offered to make
a little slice, and then--

00:35.533 --> 00:37.033
- Wait a minute.

00:37.033 --> 00:38.200
- Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.166
- He took a blade...
- Yes.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.567
- And cut on the outside
of your nasal?

00:41.567 --> 00:44.433
- On the outside,
a nice little slit here.

- My name's Phoebe. I live
in Los Angeles, California.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.066
I'm an actress, and every day,
I am paparazzi'd.

01:04.066 --> 01:09.333
I have about three paps
that stay on me 24/7.

01:09.333 --> 01:13.300
I don't know exactly
what I'm that famous for.

01:18.066 --> 01:19.300
Who knows?

01:19.300 --> 01:23.200
I'm in 15 to 20 magazines
a month.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.200
I set a bunch of the trends.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.433
I grew up in Jasper, Alabama,

01:30.433 --> 01:32.233
in high society circles

01:32.233 --> 01:34.567
with a lot of wealth--
very spoiled.

01:34.567 --> 01:37.066
Growing up,
I didn't like my nose,

01:37.066 --> 01:40.166
so my family actually found

01:40.166 --> 01:43.100
one of the top plastic surgeons
in Birmingham,

01:43.100 --> 01:45.633
and yes, I had a nose job,

01:45.633 --> 01:48.200
because I'm fabulous.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.633
At the age of 17,

01:49.633 --> 01:51.633
my mom found me
one of the top

01:51.633 --> 01:54.200
dermatologists in the world.

01:54.200 --> 01:58.500
I started using what he called
at the time "baby Botox."

01:58.500 --> 02:01.533
That way,
the lines never formed,

02:01.533 --> 02:04.533
and you would be flawless.

02:04.533 --> 02:08.133
I have probably spent
maybe a million on Botox.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.533
Like crazy.
I love Botox.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.633
If I could get Botox
put everywhere,

02:13.633 --> 02:17.266
and I mean everywhere,
I would do it,

02:17.266 --> 02:20.233
because it keeps it
nice and tight,

02:20.233 --> 02:21.667
if you know what I mean.

02:27.266 --> 02:29.633
♪ ♪

02:29.633 --> 02:31.533
Let's go.
- It's about time.

02:31.533 --> 02:34.233
- Oh, my God. It feels like
you're dry-humping me.

02:34.233 --> 02:36.266
- I'm back, bitches.

02:39.667 --> 02:41.667
- Me and Frenchy
have been friends

02:41.667 --> 02:43.400
for a couple years now.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.266
I love hanging out with Frenchy,

02:45.266 --> 02:47.667
because she just doesn't care.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.400
Oh!
- Ah!

02:55.266 --> 02:59.166
.
- Ahh!

02:59.166 --> 03:02.567
- When I came to LA,
I wanted to be an actress,

03:02.567 --> 03:05.133
so I took it on like a sport.

03:05.133 --> 03:07.700
Everything I do--I train
with the top coaches.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.300
I have probably
spent a half a million

03:10.300 --> 03:13.166
on acting coaches
and acting lessons.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.300
Oh, my God. That's my butthole!

03:16.300 --> 03:18.700
But my nose is holding me back.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.667
With a nose job,

03:20.667 --> 03:23.700
I don't think you ever
really know the true outcome,

03:23.700 --> 03:26.600
because I feel like
ever since then,

03:26.600 --> 03:30.533
my nose has constantly changed.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.333
I feel like things
are falling apart, hanging out.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.734
This could really
hurt my career,

03:36.734 --> 03:40.467
because, in LA,
it's all about your face.

03:40.467 --> 03:42.467
Even people on the internet,
they're like,

03:42.467 --> 03:45.333
"What? Does this girl, like,
pick her nose or something?

03:45.333 --> 03:48.734
Because one of her nostrils
is bigger than the other."

03:48.734 --> 03:53.300
I'm like, "Why are you looking
at my nostril that much?"

03:53.300 --> 03:55.700
There's a lot of bad
nose jobs in LA.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.200
There's people in this town
that can take all

03:58.200 --> 04:01.600
off and on their nose, because
they've had so much surgery.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.200
That's why Dr. Nassif

04:03.200 --> 04:05.700
and Dr. Dubrow are
the only doctors

04:05.700 --> 04:09.233
that I'm gonna trust
this face to.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.333
- My name is Kailan.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.767
I live in Dallas, Texas,
and my boobs are duct up.

04:14.767 --> 04:18.233
I've got these implants up
by my collarbone,

04:18.233 --> 04:20.367
and I have a whole
'nother set of boobs

04:20.367 --> 04:22.467
hanging down with my nipples.

04:22.467 --> 04:26.767
Growing up in Texas, I always
knew that I wanted big breasts.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.333
I used to put balloons
in my shirt

04:29.333 --> 04:32.200
to see what it would look like
to have big boobs.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.633
In junior high and high school,

04:33.633 --> 04:35.600
all of my friends' boobs
were growing.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.367
They were turning into these
women that I wasn't.

04:39.367 --> 04:42.233
At the age of 19,
I literally found

04:42.233 --> 04:45.233
the closest doctor
in my price range,

04:45.233 --> 04:46.767
and I went to him.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.533
He didn't talk about size.
He didn't talk about type.

04:49.533 --> 04:52.667
The only thing that he said
to me was, "Guess what?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.500
"We're gonna fill 'em up,

04:54.500 --> 04:57.500
and it's only gonna
take me 15 minutes."

04:57.500 --> 04:59.633
Of course 15 minutes
sounded great.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.000
The day of my surgery,
my sister very lovingly took me

05:03.000 --> 05:04.533
to my appointment,

05:04.533 --> 05:07.633
waited outside for,
I guess, 15 minutes.

05:07.633 --> 05:09.266
They pushed me out the door.

05:09.266 --> 05:11.400
I was throwing up
on the way out the door.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.633
I was throwing up in the car
all the way home.

05:13.633 --> 05:16.400
Looking back on it now,
it's terrifying.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.233
It's absolutely terrifying.

05:19.233 --> 05:20.500
When I took off my bandages,

05:20.500 --> 05:23.400
my implants were so high,

05:23.400 --> 05:27.200
but my breast tissue
was hanging down so low.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.767
When I called the doctor,
he said,

05:28.767 --> 05:31.367
"Don't bother coming in.
They're gonna be fine."

05:31.367 --> 05:32.667
So I never went back.

05:32.667 --> 05:35.300
I feel like my surgeon
was greedy.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.266
He didn't care about me.
He didn't care about my results.

05:38.266 --> 05:42.300
He just took my money
and left me to fend for myself.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.033
Eight years ago,
I met John, my husband,

05:45.033 --> 05:47.300
who is the most incredible,

05:47.300 --> 05:49.667
loving man
I could have ever met.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.667
The first time we were intimate,

05:51.667 --> 05:56.533
I can just remember his hands
going lower and lower

05:56.533 --> 06:00.533
and lower trying to find
my nipples.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.300
Once we finally talked about it,

06:02.300 --> 06:03.700
of course he was supportive,

06:03.700 --> 06:05.567
but it doesn't feel good

06:05.567 --> 06:08.700
to have this beautiful man
in front of you

06:08.700 --> 06:12.433
and all you're thinking about
is how stupid you look.

06:12.433 --> 06:14.734
My only solution
is to use duct tape.

06:14.734 --> 06:17.333
It's the only thing
that keeps the girls in.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.700
When I wake up in the morning,

06:18.700 --> 06:21.033
my first thought
is usually duct tape.

06:21.033 --> 06:22.600
What color am I gonna have?

06:22.600 --> 06:25.567
You have silver tape
for working out.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.467
You want to go hunting?
I've got camo duct tape.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.734
You want to feel
kind of girly and sparkly?

06:30.734 --> 06:32.600
There's glitter duct tape.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.700
This is ridiculous.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.600
Can you help me, please?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.700
- I can remember the first time
that I had to ask John

06:38.700 --> 06:41.066
to come help me with duct tape.

06:41.066 --> 06:44.700
I thought his jaw was
gonna hit the floor.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.600
He was like,
"What are you doing?"

06:54.333 --> 06:56.767
There's definitely a method
to the duct tape.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.767
It took me a little
while to figure it out,

06:58.767 --> 07:02.467
but you have to have
a cross-boob situation,

07:02.467 --> 07:05.600
and yes, that means
going over the nips.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.633
All good.

07:09.633 --> 07:12.633
- This has been a challenge for
Kailan for a really long time.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.767
She's not broken in my opinion,

07:14.767 --> 07:18.633
but I want her to feel
like she's not broken.

07:18.633 --> 07:21.100
- It is time to change this.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.633
It's time to change it
for me, for my husband.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.500
It's time to change it
for my boys.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
My breasts--they've trapped me
in a prison

07:28.500 --> 07:30.100
that I feel like
I can't get out of,

07:30.100 --> 07:33.066
and duct tape rules my life.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.367
- Mmm. You know those little
pretzels with peanut butter?

07:39.367 --> 07:41.100
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.000
- Damn, I love those.
I mean, they're so addictive.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.533
- Those are good. You mean
those little bites like this?

07:44.533 --> 07:46.100
- Mm-hmm.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.667
- Mm-hmm.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.500
- You know they're like
60 calories each?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.133
- No, they're not. Not for one.
- Oh, yeah.

07:51.133 --> 07:53.100
- So when I, like,
grab ten of them in my hand

07:53.100 --> 07:54.500
and kind of throw them in
my mouth, that's 600 calories?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.100
- You've had food enough
for a day.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.767
You've had enough calories
for a day.

07:57.767 --> 08:01.633
So did you go off your diet?
- I do like those.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.500
- We actually have a very
interesting patient

08:05.500 --> 08:08.266
named Kailan.
Look at this.

08:08.266 --> 08:10.000
This is the most extreme version

08:10.000 --> 08:12.133
of this superior displacement
I've ever seen.

08:12.133 --> 08:13.667
The only thing that's
stopping them from going up

08:13.667 --> 08:15.667
to her neck is her collarbone.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.166
Why don't we bring her in?

08:17.166 --> 08:20.000
- Can you please
send in Kailan?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.667
- Hi.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.367
- Nice to meet you. Dr. Nassif.
- Nice to meet you.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.133
- Hi, Kailan.

08:25.133 --> 08:27.000
- Kailan. Nice to meet you.
- Terry Dubrow. Pleasure.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.133
- Meeting with Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif,

08:28.133 --> 08:30.133
I am hoping that Dr. Dubrow

08:30.133 --> 08:31.567
can just give me my life back.

08:31.567 --> 08:34.367
- You have something
I haven't really seen

08:34.367 --> 08:36.667
that dramatic a version
of before--

08:36.667 --> 08:38.700
breast augmentation that's
gone so far north.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.433
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.033
- Which means superior
displacement,

08:42.033 --> 08:45.400
and when we see that,
we always wonder why.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.033
- So, when I turned 19,
I found the closest doctor

08:49.033 --> 08:51.133
that was in my price range,
and I went.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.567
We didn't talk about size,

08:52.567 --> 08:55.100
we didn't talk about
what I really wanted.

08:55.100 --> 08:58.533
He said the surgery would
take less than 15 minutes.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.734
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

09:00.734 --> 09:02.567
- That's fast.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.433
15 minutes is way too short
to do something

09:05.433 --> 09:07.700
as intense as plastic surgery.

09:07.700 --> 09:11.533
- When the bandages came off,
the implants were so high,

09:11.533 --> 09:14.200
and the breast tissue
was so low.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.600
- Okay. So you went back in
to him and said, "Hello."

09:17.600 --> 09:19.734
- Well, there was no
follow-up appointment.

09:19.734 --> 09:21.734
- He operated on you and had
no plans of seeing you again?

09:21.734 --> 09:23.166
- We had no follow-up.

09:23.166 --> 09:24.166
- A real doctor
doesn't do that.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.700
- Yeah.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.600
- You got to take care
of your patients.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.433
- Right.

09:28.433 --> 09:29.600
- So this is before
you guys met, yes?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.433
- Correct. Yes.
- Yeah.

09:31.433 --> 09:33.066
- When you met, though,
you had this issue,

09:33.066 --> 09:36.166
and you had to explore romance.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.467
- Yeah.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.467
- You'd have to show him how
to take the duct tape off

09:42.467 --> 09:44.066
before you get intimate.

09:44.066 --> 09:47.233
- Wait a minute.
What do you mean, duct tape?

09:47.233 --> 09:50.166
- When you--when you have
four boobs and you want two,

09:50.166 --> 09:52.734
your best option is
to just kind of tape them up.

09:52.734 --> 09:55.567
- When intimate, it's--
it's like clear tape.

09:55.567 --> 09:59.200
You're kidding, right?

09:59.200 --> 10:03.200
So you duct tape the breasts
to the implant mounds?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.633
- You have to...

10:04.633 --> 10:07.066
- For them to look normal.
I can show you.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.600
- Yes. I do have a picture.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.500
- Oh, you have a picture.
- Yes.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.767
- Oh, my goodness. It's like
a bra--a duct tape bra.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.100
Doesn't that destroy your skin?

10:16.100 --> 10:17.600
- Yeah.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.233
- Ouch!
I mean, they say beauty is pain,

10:19.233 --> 10:22.266
but this is taking it
to a new level.

10:22.266 --> 10:25.000
- So do you have a place
in your house--

10:25.000 --> 10:27.266
a closet that has just
a bunch of duct tape rolls?

10:27.266 --> 10:30.233
- My duct tape sits
right by my lipstick.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.633
- And a scream room
for when she takes it off.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.500
- Right.

10:35.500 --> 10:40.266
- The worst part about duct
tape is taking it off.

10:40.266 --> 10:42.100
There have definitely been times

10:42.100 --> 10:43.667
where I have looked back
at that duct tape like,

10:43.667 --> 10:45.533
"Is there a nipple
stuck to that thing?

10:45.533 --> 10:47.266
'Cause that hurt."

10:49.633 --> 10:53.233
- Answer to that is, you don't.
It's hard to leave the house.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.667
It's hard to want
to do anything,

10:54.667 --> 10:58.767
and I think that's
what's been--mm--

10:58.767 --> 11:01.266
probably the hardest part
for me,

11:01.266 --> 11:03.266
is now that we have kids.

11:03.266 --> 11:09.300
Before, I feel like I trapped
myself in this little prison.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.166
And now I feel
like I trapped them.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.300
If Dr. Dubrow could fix me,

11:14.300 --> 11:16.700
it would mean a whole
new life for me.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.300
It's a whole new world
that he could open up for us.

11:19.300 --> 11:22.266
As a family, that's priceless.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.700
- Let's go in the exam room

11:23.700 --> 11:25.266
and see if we can
figure it out, okay?

11:25.266 --> 11:26.300
- Thank you.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.133
- Come on.
- Yeah.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.300
- The next thing I know,
this giant metal file

11:30.300 --> 11:33.000
is coming up against
my nose and scraping.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.567
The sound of the bone

11:34.567 --> 11:37.000
and cartilage being ground
down was terrifying.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
- In LA, you really have
to stay on your game,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.300
so I started shaving my face.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.667
That's why men always look
younger

11:44.667 --> 11:46.734
than what women usually do,

11:46.734 --> 11:48.200
except for me.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.200
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

12:02.467 --> 12:04.467
- I assume you don't have
any duct tape on now, do you?

12:04.467 --> 12:05.734
- I do not have any now.

12:05.734 --> 12:07.400
- Okay, good.
- Yeah.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.066
- Good. So, let me see
what's going on here, okay?

12:09.066 --> 12:10.333
What I want you to do
is put your hands

12:10.333 --> 12:12.300
on your hips
and flex your muscle.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.066
Yeah, you're definitely
below the muscle.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.734
So the question is,
what do we do?

12:17.734 --> 12:19.533
Here are your options.

12:19.533 --> 12:21.333
- Okay.

12:21.333 --> 12:25.467
You can take the implants
out and just live with it,

12:25.467 --> 12:28.200
but your breasts will now

12:28.200 --> 12:31.233
just sort of hang off
your chest wall.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.367
- No.

12:32.367 --> 12:35.100
- Option two is we go in there,

12:35.100 --> 12:37.100
we figure out exactly
what is going on.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.100
I suspect it's due to
inadequately released muscle.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.500
We release the muscle.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.567
We drop a new pair
of implants into the pocket

12:43.567 --> 12:48.500
and see whether it'll pop up
the deflated breast situation.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.567
It's like a sock
that has no foot in it.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.600
We're gonna put the foot
in the sock again.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.066
The third option:
do a breast lift.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.500
The huge negative:

12:56.500 --> 12:58.233
visible breast scars that
you can see across the room.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.600
- That's okay with me...

12:59.600 --> 13:01.633
- It's better than having
that duct tape.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.367
- If it gets me to a place...
- 'Cause then she can go out.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.233
- Where I don't have
to use duct tape.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.600
A lot of scars are
a lot of scars,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.367
but it doesn't
really scare me away.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.333
- I feel good.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.266
- All right, let's throw away
the duct tape,

13:12.266 --> 13:15.667
although duct taping these up
might not be a bad idea.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.367
Will you show me how to do that?

13:17.367 --> 13:18.533
- I'll show you.
I'll show you.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.233
- All right. Very good.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.266
- Pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

13:21.266 --> 13:22.333
- Thank you.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.533
- My name is McKenna.
I'm from Reno, Nevada,

13:25.533 --> 13:27.533
and I refer to my last nose job

13:27.533 --> 13:29.400
as the cheese grater incident.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.233
The bones healed very uneven,

13:31.233 --> 13:33.633
and it left
a very jagged surface

13:33.633 --> 13:37.233
and cartilage that have formed
on the tip of my nose.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.100
It makes me feel like
I don't have a normal,

13:39.100 --> 13:41.133
natural-looking nose.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.533
I grew up
in Carson City, Nevada.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.533
I have one younger sister.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.100
Growing up, I used to have this
small, little petite nose,

13:47.100 --> 13:49.200
and then at age 12,
when puberty started,

13:49.200 --> 13:51.300
I started to notice
the size of my nose

13:51.300 --> 13:54.300
getting a lot bigger,
this giant hump forming,

13:54.300 --> 13:57.166
and the kids at school
started to make fun of me.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.166
One day, the family came home,

13:59.166 --> 14:01.433
and I made it into the house
before the rest of the family,

14:01.433 --> 14:04.166
and I played the message
waiting on the machine,

14:04.166 --> 14:07.567
and it was a group of girls
calling me "big nose bitch."

14:07.567 --> 14:09.700
And I deleted it
as fast as I could

14:09.700 --> 14:11.700
and didn't tell anybody
in the house.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.166
I was so devastated
and embarrassed.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.166
Keeping all of those
insecurities in

14:16.166 --> 14:17.567
really made high school
difficult for me.

14:17.567 --> 14:20.100
I tried to stay out
of photos with friends,

14:20.100 --> 14:22.033
and that's kind of
when I started to realize

14:22.033 --> 14:24.266
maybe I should get
my nose fixed.

14:24.266 --> 14:25.700
Once I hit college,
I just decided,

14:25.700 --> 14:27.567
"It's time to do this."

14:27.567 --> 14:30.433
When I came out of surgery,
I loved my side profile.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.333
It looked nice and small.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.433
The hump appeared to be gone.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.467
But unfortunately,
my nose started to change.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.533
It started to swell.

14:38.533 --> 14:42.333
I started to develop a small
bump on the side of my nose,

14:42.333 --> 14:45.200
so I made an appointment to have
the surgeon check it out.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.200
The next thing I know,
I'm in the procedure chair,

14:47.200 --> 14:50.600
and he comes at me with a giant
needle to numb the area.

14:50.600 --> 14:55.200
He makes a big slice,
and this giant metal file

14:55.200 --> 14:57.433
is coming up against
my nose and scraping.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.266
The sound of the bone

14:59.266 --> 15:01.333
and cartilage being ground
down was terrifying,

15:01.333 --> 15:04.333
and it felt like a jackhammer
on my face.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.400
But it actually
looked nice and flat,

15:06.400 --> 15:08.333
and so I graduated
nursing school,

15:08.333 --> 15:10.600
and then my nose
started to change again.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.633
I had small bumps of cartilage
growing on the tip of my nose.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.767
Whenever I look in the mirror
and I think about my nose,

15:16.767 --> 15:19.500
I'm haunted by this old surgery
that I had,

15:19.500 --> 15:21.333
and insecurities that I harbor,

15:21.333 --> 15:23.467
and the bullying
that I experienced growing up.

15:23.467 --> 15:25.367
I think if I were
to get my nose fixed,

15:25.367 --> 15:27.567
it would help solve
some of these insecurities

15:27.567 --> 15:29.567
and would help me
live day-to-day

15:29.567 --> 15:31.567
without focusing on my nose.

15:34.567 --> 15:39.100
♪ ♪

15:39.100 --> 15:40.467
- So my battery in my car...

15:40.467 --> 15:41.633
- You know, in that Ferrari,

15:41.633 --> 15:43.233
which, I don't drive it
that much?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.467
The battery died.

15:44.467 --> 15:45.633
- So it's, like,
been ten days...

15:45.633 --> 15:47.100
- You haven't driven
in ten days,

15:47.100 --> 15:48.233
your car battery goes dead?

15:48.233 --> 15:50.100
- Yeah. That's kind of weird.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.700
- There's something wrong
with your car battery.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.233
- Wait a minute. But hold on.
Okay, let's approve the $150,

15:54.233 --> 15:58.000
but isn't there something like
a backup battery, question mark?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.400
- Is it just me,
or is listening

16:01.400 --> 16:04.367
to Paul dictate
everything into his phone

16:04.367 --> 16:06.633
the most irritating thing
you've ever heard?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.600
Have my assistant
call Paul's assistant

16:08.600 --> 16:10.367
to tell him
to put his phone down,

16:10.367 --> 16:11.667
go to the store,

16:11.667 --> 16:14.367
and get headache tablets,

16:14.367 --> 16:16.266
because he's giving me
a headache.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.467
- Your thing came out of here.
Go to the store.

16:19.467 --> 16:24.266
- Clearly, Siri is as sick
of Paul's crap as I am.

16:24.266 --> 16:26.467
- We're gonna meet someone
who came in from Reno, Nevada.

16:26.467 --> 16:27.667
Her name is McKenna.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.533
- It just looks like a nose

16:29.533 --> 16:33.266
that's very over-operated--
very thin skin.

16:33.266 --> 16:34.767
- So she has a hard nose.

16:34.767 --> 16:36.600
- High-risk nose.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.400
- Let's see.
Can you please send in McKenna?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.166
- McKenna.
- Hello. Hi.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.000
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm McKenna.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.567
- Hi, McKenna. Dr. Nassif.
- This is my sister, Lydia.

16:45.567 --> 16:46.667
- I'm Terry Dubrow.
How are you?

16:46.667 --> 16:48.400
- Nice to meet you.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.166
- I think I've tried
to ignore the issues

16:51.166 --> 16:52.633
and just kind of push them aside
and live my life,

16:52.633 --> 16:53.700
and it's taken me
eight years now

16:53.700 --> 16:55.433
to finally realize

16:55.433 --> 16:58.233
how much they truly
affect me day-to-day.

16:58.233 --> 16:59.700
I brought a gift for you.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.367
So I love to bake,
and I thought I would share...

17:03.700 --> 17:04.700
- Oh, that is so crazy.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.667
- Hold on. Hold on.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.700
You can tell that's you
because of the longer nose...

17:08.700 --> 17:10.400
- Yes.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.000
- And that's me
with the kind of stubby

17:12.000 --> 17:14.433
with the weird, fat--
fatter face.

17:14.433 --> 17:18.567
- Right. You're kind of, like,
all gummy. Can we try them?

17:18.567 --> 17:20.266
- Absolutely.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.333
Does it pass the test?

17:23.333 --> 17:24.333
- Mm.
- Very, very good.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.533
.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.333
- Well, thank you,
that's actually--

17:27.333 --> 17:28.600
no one's ever made us cookies
like that before.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.266
- Yeah. I love that.
- Oh.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.266
- That's really sweet.
Thank you.

17:31.266 --> 17:33.033
- You're welcome.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.066
- It was really nice of McKenna
to make us cookies,

17:34.066 --> 17:35.533
but let's be honest:

17:35.533 --> 17:37.066
the last thing
anyone wants to eat

17:37.066 --> 17:39.333
is a cookie
that looks like Paul.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.667
- So we do know that
you had a rhinoplasty

17:41.667 --> 17:43.266
and some other procedures.

17:43.266 --> 17:45.300
- Yes.
So I had the rhinoplasty,

17:45.300 --> 17:48.333
and then I noticed a nice little
bump forming on this side here,

17:48.333 --> 17:51.467
so I went back, and he offered
to make a little slice

17:51.467 --> 17:54.433
and use a file
and kind of remove

17:54.433 --> 17:56.333
this extra piece...

17:56.333 --> 17:58.200
- And then glue
it back together, and then--

17:58.200 --> 17:59.433
- Wait, wait.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.667
- Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:00.667 --> 18:03.500
- He took a blade, a knife--

18:03.500 --> 18:05.066
- Yes.

18:05.066 --> 18:06.600
- And cut on the outside
of your nasal?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.500
- On the outside--
a nice little slit here.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.233
- Wow. You're clearly going
to have a visible scar,

18:11.233 --> 18:13.367
and it's basically never done,

18:13.367 --> 18:15.300
or it never should be done.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.767
What about your nose
would you want to change now?

18:17.767 --> 18:20.500
- These bumps on the end
kind of trouble me.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.767
Any improvement to look more
normal would be great.

18:22.767 --> 18:24.633
- Our next step would be
to go in the exam room,

18:24.633 --> 18:26.633
and let's take a good peek
at your nose,

18:26.633 --> 18:28.367
so then we can evaluate
and then give you our thoughts.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.467
- Okay.
Let's go do that.

18:29.467 --> 18:30.700
- Very good.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.633
- John. We have a decision
to make, okay?

18:34.633 --> 18:38.233
The right breast I have stapled
into a lifting position.

18:38.233 --> 18:42.066
The left breast is not lifted.
Would you have a lift?

18:42.066 --> 18:43.133
'Cause this is
an important decision.

18:43.133 --> 18:44.600
- Hi.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.533
- This is the size
that I wanted.

18:46.533 --> 18:47.633
Are you sure you don't want
to look at them ?

18:47.633 --> 18:49.567
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.734
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

18:56.734 --> 18:59.400
- Let's see that
little scar first here.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.266
- So right here.
- Oh, yeah.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.266
- Oh, yeah. There it is.

19:03.266 --> 19:04.667
- Look at the two
.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.233
- Yeah.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.533
- McKenna has a bad case
of bossa.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.533
These are irregular pieces
of cartilage

19:10.533 --> 19:12.734
from an over-resected tip

19:12.734 --> 19:14.734
that pretty much
is staring right at you.

19:14.734 --> 19:17.400
Cosmetically,
it's the aspect of her nose

19:17.400 --> 19:20.266
that makes her most
self-conscious.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.467
If we could make them
go away for good,

19:21.467 --> 19:24.367
it's gonna go a long way

19:24.367 --> 19:26.700
at giving McKenna the nose
that she's always wanted.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.033
The hard part of your surgery
is the twist at the end,

19:30.033 --> 19:32.300
and that cartilage,
which has a lot of memory.

19:32.300 --> 19:36.033
So the tip cartilage here
is deformed.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.700
Now, with that in mind,

19:37.700 --> 19:39.433
we need a good amount
of cartilage to do this.

19:39.433 --> 19:40.633
- Okay.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.433
- You probably have
a decent amount

19:42.433 --> 19:45.300
of cartilage inside your nose
from your septum,

19:45.300 --> 19:47.500
and most likely, just to fix
the middle part of your nose,

19:47.500 --> 19:49.433
that will suffice.

19:49.433 --> 19:52.433
It feels that McKenna has a good
amount of cartilage in her nose.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.233
If that's the case, we're not
gonna have to take rib.

19:55.233 --> 19:58.300
How are you gonna feel
if you have a 50% improvement?

19:58.300 --> 20:00.400
- That's an improvement,
so I'd be happy with that.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.500
- I have a feeling
a 50% improvement

20:02.500 --> 20:04.033
would make you feel 100% better.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.633
- Oh, I think so.
- Yeah. Me too.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.467
- Absolutely.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.333
- I want to do this.
- Yeah.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.266
- I'm turning 30.
I feel like I owe it to myself

20:11.266 --> 20:13.266
to take care of this
and move forward.

20:13.266 --> 20:16.266
As a nurse, I'm very realistic
about the possibilities

20:16.266 --> 20:18.333
and the complications
and the risks,

20:18.333 --> 20:20.667
but I have complete confidence
in Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow.

20:20.667 --> 20:21.734
Thank you.
- Pleasure meeting you.

20:21.734 --> 20:23.000
- Great to meet you.

20:27.533 --> 20:28.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:30.066 --> 20:31.533
- Good.

20:31.533 --> 20:33.266
- Checking in for surgery
with Dr. Dubrow.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.700
John can't be here
today with me,

20:34.700 --> 20:37.333
because he has to be home
with our boys.

20:39.266 --> 20:41.066
- Hey, baby.

20:41.066 --> 20:42.600
Are you nervous?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.734
- Yes.

20:44.734 --> 20:48.100
- Yeah. I'm really nervous.
How are the boys doing?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.433
- They're doing good.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.633
- Say hi to Mama.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.367
- Hi, Mama.

20:53.367 --> 20:55.767
- Hi, baby. I miss you, honey.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.500
- I miss you, Mama.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.767
- This is the first time
I've been away

20:59.767 --> 21:01.500
from my boys like this,

21:01.500 --> 21:04.100
so to be away from them--

21:04.100 --> 21:06.500
I mean, my heart hurts,

21:06.500 --> 21:08.033
but it's gonna be so worth it.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.567
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.100
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.033
- What we're gonna do today
is not that straightforward,

21:15.033 --> 21:20.100
because you may think
you need lift,

21:20.100 --> 21:22.500
but there is a possibility
that you don't.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.333
- Okay.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.700
- I mean, there's a real
possibility that you don't.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.033
- I'm afraid that
if we don't lift,

21:27.033 --> 21:28.367
then they'll still be hanging.

21:28.367 --> 21:29.734
- But we want to be smart.

21:29.734 --> 21:32.400
If we go in there
with just this one plan

21:32.400 --> 21:34.467
to get really high breasts,

21:34.467 --> 21:36.767
and I could have given you
good-looking breasts

21:36.767 --> 21:38.600
without any of those risks,

21:38.600 --> 21:42.667
and without any scars,
that's on the table.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.667
- I trust you.

21:44.667 --> 21:48.333
- I think Kailan's days of duct
taping her breasts are over.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.533
Today, for Kailan's surgery,
I'll make an incision

21:50.533 --> 21:52.734
around the bottom
half of both areolas

21:52.734 --> 21:54.667
and remove her old implants.

21:54.667 --> 21:57.133
Then I'll release the muscle
from her ribcage,

21:57.133 --> 22:00.533
allowing new implants to sit
properly in the breast pocket.

22:00.533 --> 22:02.000
So let's start
by making an incision

22:02.000 --> 22:03.667
at the bottom of the areola.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.667
Okay, so the first thing
I'll run into

22:05.667 --> 22:08.734
is muscle right down here

22:08.734 --> 22:12.033
if the muscle is holding her up,
and look at that.

22:12.033 --> 22:14.700
Yeah, it's 100% sub-muscular.

22:14.700 --> 22:18.633
When under-the-muscle
breast implants first started,

22:18.633 --> 22:21.000
we used to put them
completely under the muscle,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.767
but we saw that that didn't
allow the breast tissue

22:23.767 --> 22:26.567
and the implant to be together.

22:26.567 --> 22:28.500
Very rapidly,
we learned that you had

22:28.500 --> 22:30.767
to release the muscle
to allow the implant

22:30.767 --> 22:32.700
to sit in the breast pocket,

22:32.700 --> 22:34.700
and the muscle
to cover the implant,

22:34.700 --> 22:37.033
but not hold it up too high

22:37.033 --> 22:40.166
and allow a dissociation
between the implant

22:40.166 --> 22:42.100
and the breast tissue itself.

22:42.100 --> 22:47.500
This is an operation that really
went away over 20 years ago.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.433
This is like rotary
phone type stuff.

22:50.433 --> 22:55.066
What if we were to just convert
her to the modern

22:55.066 --> 22:57.200
All right.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.066
Let's release this muscle.

22:59.066 --> 23:00.667
Okay, so I've released
the muscle

23:00.667 --> 23:04.567
holding the implant
up into her chest.

23:04.567 --> 23:08.000
I basically just converted her
to a modern-day position.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.467
Releasing the pectoralis
major muscle allowed the implant

23:11.467 --> 23:13.200
to sit in a lower position,

23:13.200 --> 23:16.033
preventing it
from riding up too high.

23:16.033 --> 23:18.433
Okay, so we're putting
in the left one now.

23:20.533 --> 23:24.166
Here. Let's staple
the not-as-droopy one.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.467
All right,
so we're gonna simulate

23:26.467 --> 23:28.734
what a lift would look like,

23:28.734 --> 23:30.667
so that's with a lift.

23:30.667 --> 23:35.100
All right, let's go ahead
and sit her up, please.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.100
It's a pity to do
a lift on these.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.367
Would you have a lift
if you had these

23:39.367 --> 23:40.633
- I wouldn't.

23:40.633 --> 23:43.166
- Jeez.
I just want to make sure.

23:43.166 --> 23:44.500
Let's call her husband.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.767
- Okay.

23:45.767 --> 23:47.500
- John.
- Hey.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.633
- I'm a nervous wreck.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.233
- Well, she's doing very well,

23:51.233 --> 23:53.100
but we have a decision
to make, okay?

23:53.100 --> 23:57.100
The right breast I have stapled
into a lifting position;

23:57.100 --> 24:01.700
the left breast
is not lifted, okay?

24:01.700 --> 24:04.700
This has no risk
to the nipple and no scars.

24:04.700 --> 24:08.633
This has risks
to the nipple and scars.

24:08.633 --> 24:11.100
- I actually prefer
.

24:11.100 --> 24:14.633
No scars?

24:14.633 --> 24:17.467
- That's what I would prefer,
but this is her body,

24:17.467 --> 24:19.600
and I'd rather
her make that decision.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.767
- Ah! So you want me to close,
and we'll lift her later?

24:22.767 --> 24:26.600
We'll take a picture
and let her see the difference,

24:26.600 --> 24:29.667
so she'll be able
to make the call based on this.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.266
- All right, fantastic.

24:31.266 --> 24:32.467
- All right.
I'm gonna let you go.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.533
We're gonna do our thing.

24:34.533 --> 24:36.633
So what we're gonna do is allow
Kailan to make the decision.

24:36.633 --> 24:40.000
It's always better to allow the
patient to make the decision.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.533
I feel good about this. I mean,
you can always put scars on her,

24:42.533 --> 24:44.066
but you can't take them off.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.200
- Yep.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.533
- We can close. We're done.

24:47.533 --> 24:49.133
We've got more
of a problem here.

24:49.133 --> 24:51.600
Hold on.
I did not anticipate this.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.533
We might have
to rebuild the nose.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.767
I don't know
what we're gonna do yet.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.533
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

25:08.033 --> 25:11.033
- My house is three stories,

25:11.033 --> 25:14.033
and it has more clothes
than anything.

25:14.033 --> 25:17.300
I think one room
has about ten racks

25:17.300 --> 25:22.400
in it full of clothes
like some dresses, $50,000.

25:22.400 --> 25:26.433
I have shirts that
are worth $75,000.

25:26.433 --> 25:29.367
I've got some fabulous things.

25:30.700 --> 25:35.667
Everything I put on, I think,
"Would this make a magazine?"

25:35.667 --> 25:39.667
Because every time I leave
the house, I am paparazzi'd.

25:39.667 --> 25:43.467
After I'm photographed
in a dress, it'll be retired.

25:43.467 --> 25:46.033
It will go in one of my closets

25:46.033 --> 25:49.567
and probably never see
the light of day again.

25:49.567 --> 25:52.734
In LA, you really have
to stay on your game,

25:52.734 --> 25:56.467
because there's a younger girl
coming up right behind you,

25:56.467 --> 25:59.700
so you have to look
just as good as her,

25:59.700 --> 26:02.333
so I started shaving my face.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.467
Shaving helps exfoliate.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.600
That's why men
always look younger

26:06.600 --> 26:08.600
than what women usually do,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.066
except for me.

26:10.066 --> 26:13.667
You always go down.

26:13.667 --> 26:16.467
You never go against the grain.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.600
It's all about beauty.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.633
By getting my nose done,
there won't be any more dent.

26:22.633 --> 26:24.600
There won't be a big nostril.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.066
There won't be my face
collapsing, my nose collapsing.

26:28.066 --> 26:30.333
I just don't want to be
Michael Jackson.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.500
White girl with
an effed-up nose.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.734
Oh, my God.

26:37.066 --> 26:38.467
- Good morning.

26:38.467 --> 26:39.767
- Good morning.
- Hi, Miss McKenna.

26:39.767 --> 26:41.633
- Hi.

26:41.633 --> 26:44.633
- I'm a little nervous,
but it's gonna be fun.

26:44.633 --> 26:46.700
- You know, but I was thinking,
you know,

26:46.700 --> 26:49.467
with these little callouses,
little weird things here--

26:49.467 --> 26:50.767
because we're doing
a new surgery,

26:50.767 --> 26:52.633
that you could have
some irregularities.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.633
- Last time wasn't
the biggest success, so today,

26:54.633 --> 26:57.333
I'm worried that they
won't be able to fix

26:57.333 --> 26:58.734
some of the problems
that I have.

26:58.734 --> 27:00.633
But I'm trusting the doctors

27:00.633 --> 27:02.467
and really hopeful
to see what they're able to do.

27:03.633 --> 27:05.100
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

27:05.100 --> 27:06.533
- Thank you so much.
- Let's do it.

27:06.533 --> 27:08.100
- I'm excited.
- All right.

27:08.100 --> 27:09.100
- All right.
I'll see you in there.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.767
- Okay.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.400
- The hardest aspect
of McKenna's surgery today,

27:12.400 --> 27:13.533
which makes everything
difficult,

27:13.533 --> 27:15.367
is the thinness of her skin.

27:15.367 --> 27:18.133
That's gonna dictate
how the nose is gonna look.

27:18.133 --> 27:20.100
Today, for McKenna's surgery,

27:20.100 --> 27:22.000
I'll make a small incision
at the base of her nose

27:22.000 --> 27:24.400
and elevate
her very thin nasal skin.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.533
Then, I'll use a rasp
to file down the nasal hump,

27:27.533 --> 27:29.367
giving her a thinner profile.

27:29.367 --> 27:31.633
Afterward,
I'll remove the bossa,

27:31.633 --> 27:34.400
de-projecting the nose while
placing cartilage over the tip

27:34.400 --> 27:37.533
to give it a soft,
natural appearance.

27:37.533 --> 27:40.633
So I'm making
a partial incision now.

27:40.633 --> 27:44.500
I'm gonna be really careful here
because of her thin skin.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.567
I mean, she's got that
abnormal tip cartilage.

27:46.567 --> 27:50.133
We've got to see how to do this
without poking into the skin.

27:50.133 --> 27:52.433
You can see how the skin--look
how thin it is right there.

27:52.433 --> 27:54.400
- Yeah. It's like tissue paper.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.133
- Yeah. Let's just take down
and get rid of some of that bony

27:58.133 --> 28:00.400
abnormality hump that she's got.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.000
So we're rasping it down.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.433
We got more of a problem here.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.166
Hold on.

28:06.166 --> 28:09.000
That tissue does not look good
for what we're gonna do.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.133
The doctor has taken down
too much anterior septum.

28:13.133 --> 28:16.433
That means she is
at significant risk

28:16.433 --> 28:19.433
of having a nasal tip collapse.

28:19.433 --> 28:21.000
I did not anticipate this.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.700
We might have
to rebuild the nose.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.533
I don't know what
we're gonna do yet.

28:25.700 --> 28:28.600
- Let me show you
my best selfie,

28:28.600 --> 28:30.600
and you do it like this,

28:30.600 --> 28:33.567
and then you
just shoot your butt.

28:33.567 --> 28:36.066
- We got John, your husband,
on the phone,

28:36.066 --> 28:38.467
and we FaceTimed during surgery.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.700
- I don't know what happened.
I'm a little bit scared.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.533
I'm a little bit nervous.

28:48.033 --> 28:49.400
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

28:52.333 --> 28:56.133
♪ ♪

28:56.133 --> 28:58.000
We got more of a problem here.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.400
Hold on. The doctor
previously took cartilage

29:01.400 --> 29:03.166
and elongated the septum.

29:03.166 --> 29:06.166
Now that's gonna possibly
decrease the stabilization

29:06.166 --> 29:08.100
of the whole entire nose.

29:08.100 --> 29:11.066
Things have gone from bad
to worse in this procedure.

29:11.066 --> 29:14.500
What should have been
an aesthetic change

29:14.500 --> 29:16.367
has turned into a full-blown-out

29:16.367 --> 29:19.633
functional septal
reconstruction.

29:19.633 --> 29:22.100
We're gonna have to do
a septal reconstruction

29:22.100 --> 29:24.033
with rib cartilage.

29:24.033 --> 29:25.233
I thought I could
fix McKenna's nose

29:25.233 --> 29:27.467
without rib, but I was wrong.

29:27.467 --> 29:30.100
If I don't use rib cartilage
to rebuild McKenna's septum,

29:30.100 --> 29:32.633
there's a very good chance
that McKenna's septum

29:32.633 --> 29:35.033
can implode
and completely collapse.

29:35.033 --> 29:36.767
So this is gonna be
the septal reconstruction,

29:36.767 --> 29:38.367
which will give us
plenty of support

29:38.367 --> 29:40.700
so that the nose
will not collapse.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.367
Okay, let's see what
that looks like.

29:42.367 --> 29:43.767
I think it's doing its trick.

29:43.767 --> 29:45.600
I mean, it's not
perfectly pushed in,

29:45.600 --> 29:48.433
but it's good--
it's pretty darn good.

29:48.433 --> 29:51.734
So the septal reconstruction
graft has been put in,

29:51.734 --> 29:53.400
and that's gonna stabilize

29:53.400 --> 29:55.100
the septum so the nose
won't collapse.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.133
Now I can focus
my attention back

29:57.133 --> 30:00.233
to where it should be:
McKenna's nasal tip.

30:00.233 --> 30:03.533
So we pushed the tip back,
de-projected it.

30:03.533 --> 30:07.066
It's looking pretty good
from the profile.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.000
I'm feeling good.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.767
I mean, this is about as close
to perfection I'm gonna get.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.000
I'm not gonna hit a home run,
but we'll get a triple.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.400
I think she'll be happy.
I hope she's happy.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.767
She better be happy.

30:20.767 --> 30:24.667
- Hello.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.066
- I'm doing awesome.

30:26.066 --> 30:27.467
- Kailan.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.133
- Good.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.533
- First thing we're gonna do
is check your incisions,

30:31.533 --> 30:34.033
make sure you're okay,
and see how you're doing.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.667
- I also wonder what you did.
- I'll tell you.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.300
- I want to know
what you did too.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.033
- I just want to make sure
everything's fine,

30:39.033 --> 30:40.233
and then we'll have
a whole discussion about it.

30:40.233 --> 30:41.767
- Okay.

30:41.767 --> 30:43.633
- Perfect.
I don't know what happened,

30:43.633 --> 30:47.033
so I can't wait to hear
what he was able to do,

30:47.033 --> 30:49.567
what he found once
he got in there,

30:49.567 --> 30:51.166
and what my results
are gonna be.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.033
I'm a little bit scared;
I'm a little bit nervous.

30:56.233 --> 30:58.433
- Okay, good. Good. Bra.

30:58.433 --> 31:01.633
Kailan's breasts
look really great.

31:01.633 --> 31:03.633
I just hope she's happy.

31:03.633 --> 31:05.133
So I released the muscle.

31:05.133 --> 31:06.700
Then I took your implants out

31:06.700 --> 31:09.233
and put the new implants in,
slightly larger.

31:09.233 --> 31:12.033
On the table,
they looked pretty good.

31:12.033 --> 31:13.600
- Okay.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.600
- So it was a question
of looking pretty good

31:15.600 --> 31:19.700
with no visible scars
versus looking higher

31:19.700 --> 31:21.700
with a lot of scars.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.467
I didn't know, so I got John,
your husband, on the phone,

31:24.467 --> 31:25.734
and we FaceTimed
during surgery.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.533
- He was torn.

31:27.533 --> 31:28.734
- Poor John.

31:28.734 --> 31:30.600
- I know.
So he made the decision,

31:30.600 --> 31:32.266
which I think
was a good decision...

31:32.266 --> 31:33.734
- Okay.

31:33.734 --> 31:37.333
- To allow you
to make the decision.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.033
I'm gonna show you
some pictures, okay?

31:39.033 --> 31:40.200
- Okay. Yeah.
I'd love to see that.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.467
- This is with a lift
stapled up.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.667
- Okay.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.066
- And no lift.
- Okay.

31:45.066 --> 31:46.667
- Now, if you look
at that breast,

31:46.667 --> 31:48.700
that's a pretty good-looking
breast with no scars.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.000
- Right.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.266
- This is a higher-up breast,

31:51.266 --> 31:53.200
but there's scars
all the way around.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.467
- Yeah.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.066
- We thought the only person

31:56.066 --> 31:57.600
who should make this
important decision...

31:57.600 --> 31:59.600
- Yeah.
- Is you.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.300
- Yeah. How cool is it that
I get to take these boobs home

32:02.300 --> 32:04.300
and give them a good test drive,

32:04.300 --> 32:08.500
see if I like them, and if not,
I bring them in for a new model?

32:08.500 --> 32:10.767
- You get another bite at
the apple if you want one.

32:10.767 --> 32:13.367
.

32:13.367 --> 32:15.100
- Okay. Thank you so much.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.033
- I'll see you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.100
- We have a patient for you.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.633
So we have Phoebe,
who had surgery,

32:24.633 --> 32:27.233
and I think the surgery probably
was a little bit too aggressive.

32:27.233 --> 32:29.100
- Okay.
- All right,

32:29.100 --> 32:30.233
so she has a little bit
of nostril retraction.

32:30.233 --> 32:31.767
You can see inside of her nose.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.633
- A little bit
of nostril asymmetry.

32:33.633 --> 32:35.166
- Asymmetry. Let's get her
in and see what she wants us--

32:35.166 --> 32:36.600
- That looks right up
your alley.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.266
- Will you please
send in Phoebe?

32:38.266 --> 32:41.133
- Hi, bitches. I'm back.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.000
- I'm good.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.266
- Hi. Nice to see you.

32:45.266 --> 32:47.133
- Nice to see you.
- Hi. I'm Phoebe.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.000
- I'm just kidding.
I bring my best girlfriend.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.100
- Oh, no. It's Frenchy,
and she brought a friend.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.667
- So she has the French accent
and you have a Southern accent?

32:54.667 --> 32:56.533
- I'm from Alabama.

32:56.533 --> 32:58.133
- We'll get right into
the thick of it for a second.

32:58.133 --> 32:59.266
- Okay.
- What are you coming here for,

32:59.266 --> 33:01.367
I think?

33:01.367 --> 33:03.100
- Well, paparazzi'd every day,
and all these haters are saying

33:03.100 --> 33:05.266
that my nostril
is bigger than the other,

33:05.266 --> 33:08.333
that I have dents, falling,

33:08.333 --> 33:12.000
and I just feel like things
are poking out on my face.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.600
Have you ever, like,
looked down at a napkin,

33:14.600 --> 33:17.133
and it had, like,
particles of bone?

33:19.166 --> 33:21.166
- Well, kind of like chunks.
Maybe a few boogers, but...

33:21.166 --> 33:22.767
- Okay, just some junk
coming out of your nose.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.000
I never heard of anyone
having particles of bone

33:25.000 --> 33:26.767
coming out of their nose,

33:26.767 --> 33:28.700
so if this really was the case,
Phoebe would be in the hospital.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.033
However, Phoebe is an actress.

33:31.033 --> 33:34.433
I get the sense that she has
a flair for the dramatic.

33:34.433 --> 33:37.100
- I can look at a photo
of myself and point

33:37.100 --> 33:39.166
to you everything that's
wrong with my face.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.400
- Right.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.033
- On a daily basis, typically,

33:42.033 --> 33:43.700
how many selfies
do you think you take?

33:43.700 --> 33:45.233
- Probably ten.

33:45.233 --> 33:48.266
- No. At least 50.

33:48.266 --> 33:50.266
- Let me show you
my best selfie.

33:50.266 --> 33:52.166
It's, like, when you stand up...

33:52.166 --> 33:54.166
- You're just being yourself.

33:54.166 --> 33:59.266
- And you do it like this, and
then you just shoot your butt.

33:59.266 --> 34:02.066
- How many butt selfies
do you take a day

34:02.066 --> 34:03.700
- A few more.
- How do you take it--

34:03.700 --> 34:06.467
- Because I've been twerking
for the last year,

34:06.467 --> 34:09.433
and so that's how
I've been getting it,

34:09.433 --> 34:11.300
because I'm doing like
this all the time.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.200
- You twerk a lot.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.033
- Yeah, I twerk in the car,

34:15.033 --> 34:17.433
I twerk in the bed--
the last year, I thought--

34:18.433 --> 34:20.433
- Well, like this.

34:20.433 --> 34:25.066
Hey, Dr. Dubrow, if you want
your ass to match your arm,

34:25.066 --> 34:27.200
I got an exercise for you.

34:33.734 --> 34:35.133
- Phoebe...
- Mm-hmm.

34:35.133 --> 34:36.200
- In regards to your nose...

34:36.200 --> 34:38.200
- Right.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.700
- The best thing for us to do
is get you in an exam room

34:39.700 --> 34:41.333
and then see what we can do
to help you.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.000
- Okay.
Let's do it.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.700
- I think the last time that I
was carefree about my nose

34:48.700 --> 34:51.633
was back in middle school
before kids started bullying me,

34:51.633 --> 34:54.767
and it's so nice to not
have that burden any longer.

34:54.767 --> 34:56.767
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

34:56.767 --> 34:58.233
- So I have to take this...

34:58.233 --> 35:00.433
- This is freaking me
out, though.

35:00.433 --> 35:01.734
That looks like
it's supposed to be

35:01.734 --> 35:03.100
for my vagina, not my nose.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.433
- It's a little small for that.

35:04.433 --> 35:06.233
- I have a small vagina.

35:13.767 --> 35:15.667
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

35:21.500 --> 35:23.633
- Hi.

35:23.633 --> 35:25.533
- Are you sure you don't want
to look at them one more time

35:25.533 --> 35:26.734
?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

35:26.734 --> 35:28.667
If I had a dollar for every time

35:28.667 --> 35:33.133
I've seen Frenchy's breasts,
I'd be a rich man.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.400
- Be careful.
- So, what I need to do...

35:36.400 --> 35:37.633
- Oh, my God,
you're making me nervous with--

35:37.633 --> 35:39.400
- So I have to take this...

35:39.400 --> 35:41.400
- This is freaking me
out, though. Come on.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.667
That looks like
it's supposed to be

35:42.667 --> 35:44.400
for my vagina, not my nose.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.500
- It's a little small for that.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.633
- I have a small vagina.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.133
- Okay.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

35:54.133 --> 35:56.100
- Don't move, because...

35:59.667 --> 36:01.000
- All right, I think--

36:01.000 --> 36:02.667
- My God.

36:02.667 --> 36:04.000
- All righty.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.166
- I think you pierced my nose.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.700
- That was a Q-tip
I was touching to the inside

36:07.700 --> 36:09.433
of your nose--your septum.

36:09.433 --> 36:11.567
If Phoebe is in that much pain
from a little

36:11.567 --> 36:13.567
Q-tip being put in her nose,

36:13.567 --> 36:16.266
how is she gonna handle the
post

36:16.266 --> 36:18.266
That's gonna be a nightmare.

36:18.266 --> 36:20.433
You know, in regards to fixing
your nose, there's a few things.

36:20.433 --> 36:22.166
First of all,
from the breathing standpoint...

36:22.166 --> 36:23.567
- Mm-hmm.

36:23.567 --> 36:25.266
- Your airway looks
pretty good.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.133
However, the things that
you could do with surgery,

36:28.133 --> 36:29.567
if you say that they're--

36:29.567 --> 36:31.033
keep saying your nostrils
are too big--

36:31.033 --> 36:32.300
it's not that they're big...

36:32.300 --> 36:33.700
- Mm-hmm.

36:33.700 --> 36:36.166
- Just that your tip
is up like this...

36:36.166 --> 36:37.667
- Uh-huh.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.033
- Which makes you see
inside your nostrils.

36:39.033 --> 36:40.567
The only way for me to fix that

36:40.567 --> 36:43.700
is by lengthening
the tip of your nose,

36:43.700 --> 36:47.467
so taking it from like this
to dropping it.

36:47.467 --> 36:48.600
How do I do that?
- Right.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.600
- I need cartilage.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.300
I have to make a small incision
underneath your right breast,

36:53.300 --> 36:55.600
right in the crease,
about that big,

36:55.600 --> 36:58.333
take out a piece of rib,

36:58.333 --> 37:01.600
and I have to make incisions
in your ears,

37:01.600 --> 37:04.600
like right in this area here...

37:04.600 --> 37:06.467
- I came in here
for a nose job,

37:06.467 --> 37:09.467
not to get my ears removed,

37:09.467 --> 37:12.600
my boobs--bone taken out.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.700
I can't go through that.

37:14.700 --> 37:20.200
Just thinking about this is just
giving me anxiety right now.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.467
- I don't think your nose looks
bad, to be honest with you.

37:22.467 --> 37:24.200
- Yeah.
- I think it looks fine.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.700
- Yeah, he's right. Your nose
does not look that bad.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.600
So with that in mind,

37:27.600 --> 37:30.600
you're not a good candidate
this morning.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.500
Not everyone
who comes in for a consult

37:33.500 --> 37:35.200
should have plastic surgery...
- True.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.767
- And you're clearly
that type of patient.

37:37.767 --> 37:41.100
- I'm very thankful that
I found the right doctors

37:41.100 --> 37:43.233
that aren't just gonna perform

37:43.233 --> 37:45.500
a surgery on me,
take my money,

37:45.500 --> 37:47.100
and push me out the door.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.734
Thank you so much.
- So let's hug it out.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.500
- Thank you.
- Awesome. You guys are great.

37:50.500 --> 37:51.600
- It's so nice to see you guys.
You're the best.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
- Nice to see you.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.233
- We were supposed to twerk
it out. What are you talking?

37:55.233 --> 37:56.633
- Yeah, we'll try to twerk
it out. I can't twerk.

38:00.633 --> 38:02.200
- Hello.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.633
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

38:03.633 --> 38:04.633
Okay.

38:04.633 --> 38:06.100
- Okay.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.734
- Let's do a little--
let's do a nod.

38:07.734 --> 38:10.266
All right, now let me
examine you first.

38:10.266 --> 38:12.266
We're just doing
an overall check to make sure

38:12.266 --> 38:17.133
she's healing okay and that
the nasal tip skin is healthy.

38:17.133 --> 38:18.266
All right.
Let's go through it.

38:18.266 --> 38:20.000
- Okay.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.533
- Hard nose.
So when I'm opening your nose,

38:21.533 --> 38:25.533
I notice that a large
piece of septal cartilage

38:25.533 --> 38:28.667
in the upper part
of the septum was gone.

38:28.667 --> 38:29.734
- Wow.

38:29.734 --> 38:31.266
- You had nothing left here.

38:31.266 --> 38:33.266
After I took down your hump,

38:33.266 --> 38:35.667
your nose automatically
would have collapsed.

38:35.667 --> 38:38.266
I said, "Dr. Yoo, get rib now.

38:38.266 --> 38:40.667
We got to go."

38:40.667 --> 38:42.233
- I knew that my nose was bad,

38:42.233 --> 38:44.233
but hearing about
the complications today

38:44.233 --> 38:46.133
puts it on a whole new level,

38:46.133 --> 38:48.266
and I'm so grateful
that he found that

38:48.266 --> 38:51.133
and was able to help me
with taking part of my rib.

38:51.133 --> 38:52.700
- So then we took
some of the rib

38:52.700 --> 38:54.033
and reconstructed
the two side walls,

38:54.033 --> 38:56.000
opened up the airway,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.667
and you want to know something?
It worked pretty well.

38:57.667 --> 39:01.033
- That's great. Dr. Nassif
totally rebuilt my nose,

39:01.033 --> 39:02.300
and I am so grateful,

39:02.300 --> 39:04.300
and I can't wait
to see how it heals.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.700
- Thank you so much.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.300
- Take good care of her.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.300
- I will.
The roles have been reversed.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.667
- Thank you.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.700
Deciding to get
my nose fixed right

39:16.700 --> 39:18.700
when I turned 30 was
kind of a no-brainer.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.033
I knew that it couldn't
get any worse

39:21.033 --> 39:24.300
and that if anybody was gonna
help me have a better look,

39:24.300 --> 39:26.033
Dr. Nassif was the one.

39:26.033 --> 39:28.700
And now I have this perfect nose
to show for it.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.700
Today, I'm meeting up with Lydia
and some of my best friends.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.700
Not only is it my 30th birthday,

39:33.700 --> 39:36.000
but I get to show off
my new nose.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.066
I'm really looking forward
to their reactions

39:38.066 --> 39:41.333
and to see what they think
of the new me.

It's so important for McKenna's

None of them have seen her

40:19.367 --> 40:21.367
that I finally made
the right steps

40:21.367 --> 40:23.367
and made the right decision
this time.

40:23.367 --> 40:25.233

40:25.233 --> 40:27.100

40:27.100 --> 40:28.767
- Thank you.
You know, turning 30,

40:28.767 --> 40:30.767
I feel like I really had
to do something for myself.

40:30.767 --> 40:33.633
Before my surgery,
my nose had as much appeal

40:33.633 --> 40:36.233
as sugar cookies
without the sugar.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.734
It had bumps on the tip, a hump
on the bridge, was too narrow,

40:39.734 --> 40:41.367
and I think the last time

40:41.367 --> 40:43.233
that I was carefree
about my nose

40:43.233 --> 40:46.100
was back in middle school
before kids started bullying me.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.367
So it's really been
a long time--20-some years--

40:48.367 --> 40:51.233
that I've had to focus on it
and worry about it,

40:51.233 --> 40:54.100
and it's so nice to not
have that burden any longer.

40:54.100 --> 40:56.734
- Cheers to you.
- Okay.

40:56.734 --> 40:59.133
- Happy birthday.
- Yay!

40:59.133 --> 41:02.266
- To being beautiful
inside and out.

41:02.266 --> 41:04.100
- There's no finding
the duct tape,

41:04.100 --> 41:06.767
finding the clear tape,
ripping something off.

41:06.767 --> 41:09.767
Now the only thing we're
ripping off are our clothes.

I have been trapped.

in a bikini,

42:06.133 --> 42:08.367
but the last time
I saw her in a bikini

42:08.367 --> 42:10.266
was on our honeymoon,

how my breasts looked--

42:51.700 --> 42:53.700
all four of them.

42:53.700 --> 42:56.600
They were my secret shame
that I hid from the world

42:56.600 --> 42:58.533
and my true self.

42:58.533 --> 43:02.333

prison of my own making,

finally be the wife

43:05.333 --> 43:08.433

has always deserved.

huh, baby?

- Whoo-hoo! That's how you
do it, mother.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.300
I've had my eye on Dr. Nassif.
This is like a date.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.700
Dr. Nassif is short, dark,
and handsome.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.467
- He said he was going to
go see the other patient.

43:28.467 --> 43:30.333
I went to the bathroom.

43:30.333 --> 43:34.467
I could see bone, blood.
I was just like...

43:34.467 --> 43:36.767
- I went in for a tummy tuck,
and I felt this pop.

43:36.767 --> 43:39.600

I'm a little bit at a loss.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.600
It's not a good day
in the operating room.
