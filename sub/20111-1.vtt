00:45.378 --> 00:49.215
During the Second World War, the
Royal Navy created an elite squadron

00:49.382 --> 00:52.052
To carry out its most
dangerous missions.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.137
Named SBS, the unit
proved so efficient

00:54.304 --> 00:57.265
That she often worked with
Secret Services (MI6)

00:57.432 --> 00:59.768
And later became the foundation
of the US Navy Seals.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.937
The Unit is still operational
throughout the globe.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.190
Under the command of eminent men

01:05.357 --> 01:07.776
Who honor the traditions
of its founders.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.952
Let's see what we have?

02:44.122 --> 02:45.373
A kind of meat

02:46.207 --> 02:48.043
Onions for you.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.503
To the beans for me.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.508
A vegetarian thing for you
that also looks like meat.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.304
Thank you.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.724
So... Where are they?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.726
The submarine dropped them off.

03:09.981 --> 03:14.319
Persian Gulf Strait of Hormuz
- Iranian Coast

03:22.619 --> 03:23.661
They are there.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.044
Commit yourself, you
will discover the world.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.380
No, it's the slogan of the US Navy,

03:33.797 --> 03:35.465
Not SBS, you plant yourself.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.009
- You're sure ?
- Absolutely.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.409
Three... Two... One!

04:05.370 --> 04:07.831
Automatic pump shutdown
in 20 seconds.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.544
In 15...

04:14.045 --> 04:15.005
In 5...

04:15.296 --> 04:16.464
4... 3...

04:17.132 --> 04:18.007
Off

04:19.634 --> 04:20.802
In place, Aggy.

04:29.019 --> 04:29.894
Junction

04:30.061 --> 04:30.770
At 500 meters.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.523
Then straight towards
the target for 1,2 km.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.568
Allow 20 minutes to swim,
as much for the return.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.029
The communications are good.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.449
Affirmative.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.910
If the pump is activated
before it is released?

04:46.202 --> 04:50.415
The current will prevail so far,
where they are likely to be crushed.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.917
- That's a feared one!
- Right.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.503
- We hear you!
- Sorry !

04:55.670 --> 04:56.546
Everything is fine.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.560
We're at the junction.
We turn south.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.228
Marty, are you?

05:12.937 --> 05:14.481
Here 1-2.
Right behind you.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.404
Checks oxygen levels.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.989
It does not sound good to me.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.866
Warning Reservation 50%

05:26.451 --> 05:29.204
There is a problem.
You are under 50%.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.206
Well received. Affirmative.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.249
I now read 45%.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.460
Oxygen is lost too fast.

05:36.211 --> 05:39.130
This water must contain
a caustic substance.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.715
And we did not know?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.760
This grid was also
not on the schemas.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.223
They are blocked.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.101
Stratton?

05:51.351 --> 05:54.354
The absurdity of this
mission is now official.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.855
We have nothing at all!

05:57.357 --> 05:58.233
Hold on !

06:00.819 --> 06:03.530
Marty is lacking oxygen.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.324
I repeat: 1-2 has no more oxygen.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.743
He's on the reserve.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.913
It will not take more than 2 min.
And I do not know!

06:26.428 --> 06:27.470
I am short of !

06:29.097 --> 06:30.223
1-1, you get me?

06:32.976 --> 06:34.436
I repeat. Here Zero.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.146
1-1, you get me?

07:07.802 --> 07:10.347
- They're on snorkeling.
- Yeah, it's gonna do it.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.724
They have 300 meters left.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.104
Shit !

07:18.271 --> 07:19.147
Reactivated pumps.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.667
Come on! Come on!

07:58.687 --> 07:59.896
Zero, we're there!

08:00.939 --> 08:01.815
Great.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.784
Can not use pipe.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.120
- More oxygen.
- Well received.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.871
Meeting point 2.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.561
No guards on patrol?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.520
On the satellite, at least 16

08:41.688 --> 08:43.023
The last 10 days.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.525
Not one.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.777
Or very small!

09:06.171 --> 09:07.339
Charges in place.

09:07.756 --> 09:08.631
Well received.

09:08.798 --> 09:09.883
Send the helicopter.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.637
Join the exit at the
back of the building.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.766
Flight plan for meeting point 2.

09:17.932 --> 09:18.808
Including.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.107
Where are the men ?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.401
Why is there nobody?

09:30.152 --> 09:31.028
Incomprehensible.

09:34.239 --> 09:35.991
1-1, here Tin Man, in touch

09:36.158 --> 09:37.034
With 1-5.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.518
Where are we ?

10:08.357 --> 10:09.233
Still hot.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.945
- 30 min max.
"Brothel!

10:36.218 --> 10:37.261
Aggy, you see that?

10:37.678 --> 10:38.929
It's storage of biochemistry.

10:39.346 --> 10:40.723
It was ! But now

10:41.098 --> 10:43.684
This is an apocalyptic
crime scene.

10:44.059 --> 10:46.812
We arrived too late.
The products have disappeared.

10:47.187 --> 10:48.105
Shit !

10:50.441 --> 10:51.358
What do you think ?

10:51.608 --> 10:55.029
At the precise moment,
that one can not trust...

10:55.863 --> 10:56.905
Than to the two of us.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.116
It's okay with me.

11:02.911 --> 11:05.289
Evacuation at point 2 negative!

11:05.789 --> 11:07.499
The team is already at point 2.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.793
We do not know what lies ahead.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.879
- Evacuate me.
- Negative. We do not enter

11:12.046 --> 11:15.591
- in Iranian space.
- No choice. Send the helicopter.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.718
- Must have an authorization.
- Negative.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.802
It urges. Execution.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.642
Including.
I will evacuate you.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.187
Tin Man, here Zero.
Cancellation point 2.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.938
On-call evacuation 1-1.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.357
Confirm. Completed.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.109
Well received.
On-call evacuation 1-1. Completed.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.862
- Dangerous terrain, right?
- Yeah!

11:38.614 --> 11:39.490
Let's go !

11:52.878 --> 11:53.796
We're being pulled!

12:20.656 --> 12:23.117
Do not move !
Explosive loads!

12:30.582 --> 12:32.167
Come on! Let's move !

12:38.882 --> 12:39.758
Recharge!

12:52.521 --> 12:53.439
I am touched !

12:58.110 --> 12:59.862
Monte! Where'd you hit?

13:00.195 --> 13:01.530
Come on! Started !

13:27.848 --> 13:29.224
Inside !

13:32.519 --> 13:34.229
Go ahead ! To the left !

13:58.879 --> 14:01.382
- Get out of there !
- Where's the fucking exit?

14:15.187 --> 14:18.399
Code 1-2 touched.
Injury in level 2 stability.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.695
I repeat :
Level 2 stability.

14:33.997 --> 14:35.040
He left the road!

14:51.390 --> 14:52.266
Where is Tin Man?

14:53.392 --> 14:54.268
One minute.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.811
1-1, here Tin Man.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.188
I've seen you.
I arrive.

15:01.316 --> 15:03.277
Down ! Down !

15:04.361 --> 15:05.279
We attack!

15:05.404 --> 15:07.281
A grenade! Move!

15:19.543 --> 15:22.463
Injury of 1-2 in level 1.
Arterial wound in the neck.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.175
Hold it hard!
Keep your head up.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.135
Quick, guys!

15:28.302 --> 15:29.928
Where's that fucking helicopter?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.805
At 30 seconds. Hold on tight.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.932
Come on, tight! Move!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.225
Touch it!

15:35.392 --> 15:36.185
Standing !

15:44.151 --> 15:46.195
Go around! I've got your back !

15:52.242 --> 15:53.160
Inside !

15:53.410 --> 15:54.370
Cover us!

15:59.375 --> 16:00.709
Get it up!

16:02.628 --> 16:03.837
Where is the doctor?

16:13.681 --> 16:14.932
Wake up !

16:16.642 --> 16:17.559
Wake up !

16:18.018 --> 16:18.936
Come on, Marty!

16:20.312 --> 16:21.730
Wake up !

16:23.440 --> 16:25.109
Please, Marty!

18:34.405 --> 18:37.574
It's finish.
Never call me again.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.538
It's okay ?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.481
Why do you ever drink
your own food?

19:52.066 --> 19:53.275
It would not be funny.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.613
Yeah, yeah.
Crisis of authority?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.576
She took my pewter mug.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.828
Yeah, party for good.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.956
I thought she was going to
explode your rotten rafiot.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.793
It would have embellished the landscape.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.670
I liked this mug.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.965
Remember my first
dive in Poole Harbor.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.218
She was not for you.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.429
You did not say that
when I brought her.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.350
"It was the rare pearl!"
- I changed my mind.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.444
It's hard ?

20:42.199 --> 20:43.450
Give me my jacket.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.619
We go down to the pub.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.913
A good guy came from Trent.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.541
He was a good guy from Trent.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.003
To the cock so long that it fell.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.923
To relieve himself, in
a case he stuffed it.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.300
But then, it exploded!

21:02.803 --> 21:04.138
Come on, another one!

21:06.265 --> 21:08.642
A marsupial in rut named Reeves.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.770
It was your favorite
when you were a kid!

21:11.937 --> 21:14.398
A marsupial in rut named Reeves,

21:14.648 --> 21:18.277
Between the thighs of the
girls of joy amused.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.072
When they claimed the
money, he said my darlings,

21:22.239 --> 21:25.284
On the eucalyptus bush
a koala grazes gratis.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.169
Good night.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.683
So we decided on Justin.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.769
Justin Henry.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.520
Nice name, right?

21:54.063 --> 21:55.272
Yeah, great.

21:55.856 --> 21:56.732
Yeah.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.152
I'll go see him
after this drink.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.372
Headquarters MI6 - London

22:25.177 --> 22:28.597
Reporters' teams were not
allowed on the site.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.057
She's waiting for you.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.643
According to the Islamic
Republic, military forces

22:32.768 --> 22:35.020
Have forced Iranian airspace,

22:35.187 --> 22:37.189
And killed 45 innocent employees.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.109
Most of them lived in
the neighboring town.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.070
Thank you.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.990
Excuse this unconventional side.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.159
My calendar is overloaded.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.454
No problem.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.250
Sergeant Stratton, you
are very effective.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.005
You do not have the reputation
of respecting authority.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.633
You changed the protocol in
the middle of a mission.

23:04.842 --> 23:05.843
Against orders.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.471
You saw that brazier.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.183
Not on TV.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.103
No Madam.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.564
Really sorry for
Sergeant Sturgess.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.316
It is a great loss.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.610
They were waiting for us.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.906
Whatever they were,
they came for us.

23:28.282 --> 23:31.994
And they had to steal what
we were supposed to destroy.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.788
Not only do they
possess the substance,

23:35.039 --> 23:37.624
But we pass, and by
extension Washington,

23:37.791 --> 23:39.460
For war criminals.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.672
I had never felt
such an outburst...

23:44.715 --> 23:46.091
Of my entire career.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.304
I am prepared to accept
any sanction, madam.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.473
Happy to hear you say it.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.183
But it will not help.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.935
Even without airspace violation,

23:57.269 --> 23:58.687
Civilians were killed.

23:58.854 --> 24:02.274
Iran, Russia, Hezbollah,
all will blame us.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.818
The crucial point:

24:04.985 --> 24:07.446
Weapons of mass
destruction in nature!

24:07.696 --> 24:11.200
Whatever the owners, their
logistics worry me.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.493
Yes Madam.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.373
- They were very organized.
"It's up to us to be!"

24:18.666 --> 24:21.460
I wanted to make sure
you had a clear mind.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.880
I am afraid that the outcry
is only at its beginning.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.050
Aggy! Where's the helicopter?

24:28.425 --> 24:30.010
At 30 seconds. Hold on tight.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.096
Hold it tight!

24:51.156 --> 24:53.492
You pointed to something
missing from my report?

24:57.413 --> 24:58.789
It was spontaneous, Aggy.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.834
I did not plan to
change your strategy.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.422
Napoleon was asked about
his plans of battle.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.926
He said, "Show yourself,
and see what happens."

25:12.553 --> 25:13.429
You?

25:14.972 --> 25:15.889
Napoleon?

25:16.265 --> 25:17.683
But much larger,

25:18.308 --> 25:20.894
And best dancer, as I was told.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.401
You were right.
You've probably saved lives.

25:28.152 --> 25:31.196
- You would have done the same.
- What if I was on the ground?

25:32.072 --> 25:33.824
To be wrong does not help.

25:35.576 --> 25:36.744
It's horrible.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.373
Stratton?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.292
You're not suspended?

25:45.085 --> 25:45.961
No.

25:50.341 --> 25:53.093
We are loaded with Spinks to
find out where the link is.

25:53.469 --> 25:57.014
Mission newspapers, listeners,
prior to the mission.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.557
These types...

25:59.183 --> 26:00.768
Knew we were coming.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.771
Turns back.

26:08.359 --> 26:09.401
What?

26:09.943 --> 26:11.111
He's on duty.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.530
- It's too blurry.
- Yeah.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.200
Not clear enough for
facial recognition.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.785
Try another plan,

26:18.243 --> 26:19.620
Or clarify that one?

26:22.998 --> 26:25.709
I would go faster without
your breath in my neck.

26:32.883 --> 26:36.053
Base SBS - London

26:48.231 --> 26:49.440
Sergeant Stratton.

26:50.608 --> 26:51.484
Follow me.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.577
You should have gone home.

27:03.579 --> 27:04.914
For birth.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.542
And leave you all the fun?

27:12.046 --> 27:13.214
Stratton?

27:18.469 --> 27:20.013
Marty's replacement?

27:21.389 --> 27:22.682
We can not replace it.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.438
I've gone through your file.
Impressive.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.522
Thank you.

27:29.605 --> 27:31.190
You are appreciated, sir.

27:31.357 --> 27:34.027
Drop the "gentleman."
Just Stratton.

27:35.319 --> 27:38.448
Two missions in
Afghanistan, with MAKO 30.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.742
- Very dangerous.
- Thrilling.

27:42.368 --> 27:44.746
"Marty was your commanding officer?"
- Yes sir.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.998
- You were close?
- Very good.

27:47.206 --> 27:49.751
I was a blue, and
he often saved me.

27:49.917 --> 27:51.961
We were almost always together.

27:52.211 --> 27:53.963
- A good guy.
- Very good !

27:54.922 --> 27:56.424
According to your case,

27:57.258 --> 28:00.803
You declined 3 assignments
and a promotion. Why ?

28:01.721 --> 28:04.307
We go where we think
we can give the best.

28:04.724 --> 28:08.603
If it's to avenge Marty, I'll
send you back to the States.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.813
- I can manage.
- I do not care.

28:11.689 --> 28:14.233
A misguided mind is a risk.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.194
I will not be plumbing

28:16.361 --> 28:18.154
Because Marty obsesses you.
Is that clear ?

28:19.113 --> 28:19.989
Clear.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.325
We are waiting for you at MI6.

28:23.242 --> 28:24.827
- 2 class Monroe?
- Yes.

28:25.244 --> 28:26.579
Welcome to the Unit.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.956
Team of Sergeant Stratton.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.126
I would change if I were you.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.089
Bitch!

28:37.173 --> 28:38.633
We have an unknown quantity

28:38.800 --> 28:41.135
Of a biological weapon
named Neige de Satan

28:41.302 --> 28:42.929
Which floats somewhere.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.682
Consisting of the
most deadly pathogens

28:45.848 --> 28:47.183
Known to date.

28:49.852 --> 28:50.853
What do we know?

28:51.270 --> 28:53.648
No claim of terrorist group.

28:54.148 --> 28:56.609
They prefer to let
us wear the hat.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.904
And the Iranians will not
share any information.

29:00.655 --> 29:04.242
We're trying to identify this man.
Spotted by Sergeant Stratton.

29:04.575 --> 29:06.869
Caucasian type, about 50 years old.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.746
It seemed different,

29:08.913 --> 29:11.249
Gave orders,
controlled the land.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.876
We have nothing
in the databases.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.511
This is Gregor Barovski.
Russian secret services.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.556
Specialist in counter
intelligence in Europe.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.517
Responsible for the death
of nine of our agents.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.311
The most dangerous man.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.272
With such a CV,

29:35.064 --> 29:37.275
Why it does not
appear in the file?

29:37.817 --> 29:39.068
He's a former agent.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.196
Death for 20 years.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.742
If Barovski is alive...

29:46.868 --> 29:49.037
Stratton, Cummings, follow me!

29:52.081 --> 29:54.334
Barovsky was so formidable,

29:54.876 --> 29:56.961
And rising star of
the Secret Service,

29:57.128 --> 30:00.131
That MI6 created an intervention
force to bring it down.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.842
At 95, an operation

30:03.176 --> 30:05.762
To expose him as a dual agent.

30:06.804 --> 30:07.764
It worked.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.642
The Russians were mounted
against their best agent.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.644
In the same year,

30:13.811 --> 30:16.022
That his family had murdered him.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.108
He was presumed dead for 20 years.

30:20.026 --> 30:23.738
One can not describe its dangerousness
or the extent of its resources.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.158
It violated our security,
we must react very quickly.

30:27.700 --> 30:31.287
I make contact with Interpol.
Stratton directs the operations.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.330
MI6,

30:32.455 --> 30:35.583
Target potential clients,
and work in support.

30:37.001 --> 30:37.877
In support?

30:38.628 --> 30:41.756
Since when did the Special
Forces support MI6?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.385
Leave our egos aside.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.179
Or Barovsvki will
swallow us all raw!

30:49.180 --> 30:50.056
Yes Madam.

31:06.989 --> 31:10.159
UKRAINE

31:55.455 --> 31:58.416
An industrial area in
the area was evacuated.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.003
At this time there
are 148 victims,

32:02.295 --> 32:05.840
But the research teams believe that
the balance sheet will be heavier.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.008
The Snow of Satan.

32:07.383 --> 32:09.469
- It's just at ground level.
- Right?

32:09.635 --> 32:12.347
This toxic agent is
used at high altitudes.

32:12.722 --> 32:16.225
It can cover an area 100 times
more extensive than this village.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.895
It sounds like an
intimidation test,

32:19.479 --> 32:21.731
Rather than a shedding
of the substance.

32:21.981 --> 32:25.151
Effective dispersal requires
a complex technique.

32:25.568 --> 32:29.364
Only two people are able to transform
the substance into a weapon.

32:30.073 --> 32:30.990
Adnan Homsi.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.992
Last location: Aleppo.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.870
But would Barovski venture
into a fighting zone?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.291
- And Tariq Alawi.
- Interpol located him in Rome.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.211
But this photo dates a little.
No one has seen him again.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.673
The crossing with the MI5 proves
its collaboration with the KGB.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.675
All roads lead to Rome !

32:49.759 --> 32:50.635
Let's go.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.054
I agree.
It is our best track.

32:54.097 --> 32:58.601
Men, women, children.
Decimated whole families.

33:00.103 --> 33:03.481
ROME

33:07.276 --> 33:08.152
It's him.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.987
Yes, I see them.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.865
We have our man, plus one.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.953
500 meters away.
Alawi and a bodyguard.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.454
I see him.

33:18.996 --> 33:19.872
Let's go.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.007
100 meters to walk.

33:52.238 --> 33:53.114
Go ahead, Hank.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.329
Climb !

34:11.882 --> 34:12.759
Tariq Alawi.

34:13.926 --> 34:16.763
- Alawi is enough.
- I have another name for you.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.222
Hasht Bandi?

34:18.848 --> 34:19.766
Well what?

34:20.224 --> 34:22.768
According to CNN, the British have burned

34:22.935 --> 34:24.728
An Iranian pharmaceutical center.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.107
- Not without the agreement of the USA.
- Leave politics!

34:28.274 --> 34:31.610
- We know what this center was doing.
- Cancer research?

34:34.112 --> 34:35.156
Cyclosarine.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.451
The Snow of Satan.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.746
You and I know that nothing
has been destroyed.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.500
The substance was stolen,
and out of Iran.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.752
I'll tell you my thoughts.

34:48.043 --> 34:50.463
If you were there
to stop me, I would

34:50.755 --> 34:52.757
In an airplane to America.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.176
Where I would be subjected
to the torture of water.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.636
But I'm here.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.680
So, if you went straight to the point?

34:58.971 --> 35:00.223
Need information.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.184
You were commissioned to
make a chemical weapon.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.228
I'll tell you no salads.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.355
I know your job,
and you're mine.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.816
I make weapons for
a lot of people.

35:09.982 --> 35:12.443
Some want to blow
their business,

35:12.610 --> 35:15.571
Their boat or their wife,
for the insurance premium.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.157
Or terrorists who
kill as they please.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.707
Yes, he is one of my clients.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.959
He ordered me a
scattering device.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.502
Dispersing device?

35:29.669 --> 35:32.296
Liquid mixture in steam.
Very light.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.674
He explained why?
Where and when ?

35:35.049 --> 35:37.385
Imagine what?
The exact place,

35:37.552 --> 35:38.928
The date and time?

35:40.054 --> 35:40.930
No !

35:41.681 --> 35:43.141
He pays, and I execute.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.643
People die, that's
not my problem.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.855
You're responsible for the
deaths of thousands of people.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.733
And soon hundreds of thousands.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.151
Same for you.

35:53.443 --> 35:56.237
Except that I do not pretend
to serve a good cause.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.456
One of my colleagues filmed.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.833
It belongs to the US Navy.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.170
Of course, I will not know his name.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.798
But he was the best
shooter in his unit

36:15.923 --> 36:16.924
Five years in a row.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.177
In addition to the camera,

36:19.886 --> 36:21.596
It had a semi-automatic.

36:21.846 --> 36:25.475
Cartridges 7.62 x 51
NATO nomenclature.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.561
Easy shot at 600 meters.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.189
It looks like you.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.691
What does he has ? Five...

36:34.650 --> 36:35.651
Six years ?

36:38.946 --> 36:40.698
- We start with him.
- No !

36:40.865 --> 36:42.367
- 1st target.
- No !

36:42.450 --> 36:43.326
Including.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.828
No, please!
Not my son!

36:46.037 --> 36:47.163
Target in visual?

36:47.538 --> 36:48.414
Very clear.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.500
Okay. A fan of drones.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.669
- To my signal.
- Its good !

36:53.711 --> 36:55.421
Greco. He's your man.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.800
It is Russian, under
an assumed name.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.594
It supplies supplies
for dentists, wicks,

37:01.969 --> 37:03.221
- microphone...
- Where is he ?

37:07.850 --> 37:10.061
It has a workshop on the
banks of the Tiber.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.772
I do not know any more, I swear.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.945
If you told your son
that Daddy is okay?

37:20.071 --> 37:20.947
It's okay ?

37:21.948 --> 37:22.824
My son...

37:23.282 --> 37:24.200
Think about it.

37:24.492 --> 37:25.743
Hello, that's...

37:31.958 --> 37:33.501
A number between one and three.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.211
Two.

37:35.545 --> 37:36.462
Right answer.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.218
Greco?

37:43.011 --> 37:43.886
Greco.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.854
There's a deal with Stratton?

37:53.855 --> 37:54.731
That is to say ?

37:57.316 --> 37:59.569
You worked with him.
How is he ?

38:01.112 --> 38:03.114
I only worked twice with him.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.241
Reserved, I suppose.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.161
He does not reveal his cards.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.164
Reserve ?

38:11.497 --> 38:13.458
Marty never described it like that.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.668
- Did you know Marty?
- Yes.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.503
Very good.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.133
They seemed to agree.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.803
Marty would not have followed
him without trusting him.

38:26.721 --> 38:31.059
This guy had an infallible flair.
He knew if you were stuck.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.857
Stratton is not responsible
for his death.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.526
Sorry.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.487
There was no implication.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.077
That's right.

38:50.078 --> 38:50.995
Last stage.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.582
"We'll go round from behind."
- Let's go.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.497
Our amateur drones arrives.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.168
Accompanied by two big arms.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.336
I see them.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.548
He has bodyguards.
He expects the visit.

40:34.515 --> 40:35.933
- Stratton?
- Its good.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.232
Go quickly !

40:45.068 --> 40:45.943
Let's go !

41:38.746 --> 41:41.207
- That's all I found.
- Thank you.

41:47.088 --> 41:47.964
Hold on.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.762
We got something.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.938
Too dark to identify it.

42:04.105 --> 42:06.149
It is surely him.
It's Barovski.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.402
- You gotta get him.
- Hold on.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.030
It serves no purpose without the product.

42:19.454 --> 42:22.582
Enter. Make yourself at home.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.586
You brought some friends.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.049
Another conception of trust.

42:32.008 --> 42:33.801
No, simple precaution.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.636
You can understand.

42:42.769 --> 42:44.520
You see ? He's there!

42:45.897 --> 42:48.691
The target is programmed
on the four drones.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.362
Within a radius of three kilometers.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.823
We enter the launch code.
The GPS will guide it.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.743
After that, you have five minutes.

43:03.247 --> 43:06.668
Nobody could have done that
to you as well as I did.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.046
I worked hard on these drones.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.882
I want to be sure
of a fair reward.

43:47.709 --> 43:49.002
He found her, shit!

44:08.103 --> 44:09.312
Who is spying on us?

44:09.604 --> 44:11.440
I do not know what you're talking about.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.950
I repeat: who is spying on us?

44:30.292 --> 44:31.585
I have not spoken!

44:31.918 --> 44:33.795
I would never betray
you, I beg you!

44:36.798 --> 44:40.052
Test that fucking
drone, and stand up!

44:40.218 --> 44:42.721
I do not want any
fucking, please!

44:47.893 --> 44:48.852
For courage.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.259
Gregor... Please!

46:04.386 --> 46:05.762
What is he looking for ?

46:07.514 --> 46:08.432
We are!

46:55.103 --> 46:57.064
We should catch him now!

46:57.356 --> 46:59.191
There are not enough of them.

46:59.566 --> 47:00.776
We need reinforcements.

47:01.276 --> 47:03.945
It will lead us to toxic
gas, and then we kill it.

47:04.321 --> 47:05.530
Call for reinforcements.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.240
Hold on ! Shit !

47:13.830 --> 47:14.748
Recharge!

47:17.376 --> 47:18.377
Aggy, block it!

47:24.216 --> 47:25.092
Oh shit !

47:38.313 --> 47:39.189
Monte!

49:19.247 --> 49:21.375
He left.
Go in from the back.

49:35.931 --> 49:36.807
Shit !

50:03.291 --> 50:04.584
I like this place.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.588
It is a memorial
for simple people

50:08.755 --> 50:11.008
Who gave their lives
to save others.

50:11.925 --> 50:14.219
William Donald, Bayswater.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.972
19, railway employee.

50:17.389 --> 50:21.018
Drowned trying to save a guy
from a tangle of seaweed.

50:21.768 --> 50:24.062
An entanglement of algae.

50:25.355 --> 50:27.441
The Victorian era had style!

50:29.359 --> 50:31.361
What went wrong in Rome?

50:32.320 --> 50:33.697
Barovski spotted us.

50:35.365 --> 50:37.325
The analysis of the indices in Greco?

50:37.909 --> 50:40.495
It is believed that the
drone that was secured

50:40.662 --> 50:42.372
Is one of the four built.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.250
I think Barovski has the
other three and the gas.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.377
Target ?

50:47.961 --> 50:50.797
Before cracking the
guidance module,

50:51.715 --> 50:52.924
It remains unknown.

50:53.258 --> 50:56.470
Assuming the four drones
have the same target.

50:57.387 --> 50:58.263
Exact.

51:02.851 --> 51:04.811
I went through the Barovski file.

51:06.229 --> 51:07.147
I have a name:

51:08.190 --> 51:09.316
Sergei Orlov?

51:10.734 --> 51:12.569
The second of Barovski at the time.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.114
Did you know him?

51:16.531 --> 51:18.825
He was commissioned to
assassinate Barovski.

51:19.576 --> 51:22.704
His friend and boss.
Orlov signed his death warrant.

51:23.372 --> 51:25.332
After that, he quickly
climbed the ladder.

51:25.499 --> 51:26.583
Two months ago,

51:26.875 --> 51:29.127
He was appointed Minister
of the Interior.

51:29.961 --> 51:31.546
Springboard for the
position of Prime Minister.

51:31.838 --> 51:33.423
President, if he is clever.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.259
Stay right.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.056
My friend.

51:41.139 --> 51:42.349
But I was your friend.

51:43.016 --> 51:46.186
A true friend would have
executed the sentence?

51:47.229 --> 51:49.189
Putting a bullet in your head?

51:50.273 --> 51:51.525
I left you alive.

51:52.776 --> 51:56.029
Orlov did not kill his friend.
He hides it clandestinely.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.907
And now you are going
to leave this exile.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.953
The British target a
chemical lab in Iran.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.913
Their plan must fail.

52:05.414 --> 52:07.040
We need help for that.

52:08.041 --> 52:10.335
It could open the
door to the future.

52:10.669 --> 52:13.130
English soldiers dead
on Iranian soil,

52:13.296 --> 52:15.549
It would be a political
coup for Moscow.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.428
I have the money to
finance the operation.

52:19.886 --> 52:21.263
Leave the gas on site.

52:21.638 --> 52:23.682
Make it media-friendly.

52:24.391 --> 52:25.934
Except he disappeared.

52:28.478 --> 52:31.023
Over time, Barovski
had matured...

52:31.481 --> 52:33.942
- waiting for the right moment.
- Revenge.

52:35.610 --> 52:38.613
Barovski doubled it, and
appropriated the gas.

52:54.546 --> 52:55.714
Come on, Stratton.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.841
Do not turn around the pot.

52:59.051 --> 53:00.177
Ask a question.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.804
The Barovski file was
quasi-classified.

53:04.306 --> 53:07.642
I have crossed with other sources,
and made some deductions.

53:08.060 --> 53:09.644
A name always comes back.

53:16.151 --> 53:19.613
I was a young field
worker, when my superiors

53:19.780 --> 53:22.657
Joined me in the operation
of discredit of Barovski.

53:23.575 --> 53:26.453
I went to Cairo and
made contact with him.

53:26.953 --> 53:28.789
I convinced him of my sincerity.

53:29.331 --> 53:30.290
For five months,

53:30.666 --> 53:32.959
I gave him false information.

53:33.168 --> 53:34.294
He looked at me,

53:34.920 --> 53:36.546
To see if I was lying.

53:37.881 --> 53:39.257
An attraction was born.

53:40.384 --> 53:43.637
I suppose to have seduced
him, gained his confidence.

53:44.554 --> 53:46.098
Then, according to my orders,

53:48.058 --> 53:49.768
I accused him of being a double agent.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.812
Inner Dilemma.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.107
To blow a blow to his ex-boss?

53:58.443 --> 54:01.321
Unless...
Am I still in love with her?

54:03.198 --> 54:04.700
That I work with him.

54:06.576 --> 54:08.245
You are my best agent.

54:09.621 --> 54:11.081
You'll find out.

54:34.771 --> 54:35.772
What is that ?

54:36.857 --> 54:39.151
I suppose that after Rome
I shall be relieved.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.861
I just anticipated.

54:41.778 --> 54:45.115
- You're still under my command.
- I failed !

54:46.324 --> 54:49.202
I put the team in danger,
and people were killed.

54:49.619 --> 54:51.913
I am surprised not to be sued.

54:53.040 --> 54:53.915
What?

54:54.750 --> 54:55.625
Come !

55:03.675 --> 55:06.595
Tell me why you want
to repair the engine

55:06.928 --> 55:09.556
Of a boat that will
not resist vibrations

55:09.723 --> 55:10.974
From the start?

55:11.183 --> 55:13.101
A boat is made to sail.

55:14.394 --> 55:15.687
Is that American?

55:16.063 --> 55:18.148
- Hank, it's Ross.
"Enchanted, Sir."

55:18.482 --> 55:20.442
Wait till they make me a knight.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.444
From one day to the next, it appears.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.530
You know the navigation?

55:26.281 --> 55:27.616
It comes from the US Navy.

55:27.783 --> 55:30.160
I ask him if he can sail,

55:30.285 --> 55:32.829
I do not care what he
can do underwater.

55:32.996 --> 55:36.041
I always avoided.
Never seen the interest.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.378
My parents are 10
meters away in Manteo.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.505
I spent my summers on board.

55:41.838 --> 55:44.341
I am impressed.
10 meters, you say?

55:44.841 --> 55:46.593
Yes ? Any well laid out?

55:46.927 --> 55:48.011
Curtains ?

55:48.178 --> 55:51.306
Your nautical theme chosen by your mother.
Ivory and blue.

55:52.140 --> 55:54.434
Nice little boats that pitch?

55:54.601 --> 55:55.602
Yes.

55:55.686 --> 55:56.895
Well, excuse me.

55:57.479 --> 55:59.106
I whistle Life in Rose.

55:59.398 --> 56:00.273
Given.

56:00.357 --> 56:01.274
He likes you.

56:04.027 --> 56:04.903
To the Queen!

56:05.904 --> 56:06.780
To the Queen!

56:10.200 --> 56:13.995
I remember precisely the day
I knew this young wolf.

56:14.454 --> 56:16.081
He was not more than nine years old.

56:16.748 --> 56:18.417
Always suspended from the latch.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.377
I ended up having pity,

56:21.086 --> 56:23.588
A day when I needed a boyfriend.

56:25.215 --> 56:26.800
His parents being dead,

56:26.967 --> 56:29.386
The social services had
taken charge of it.

56:29.761 --> 56:32.681
They found him a host family,

56:32.848 --> 56:36.184
But it was here that he
was brought up, on boats,

56:38.270 --> 56:39.688
By this human waste.

56:41.023 --> 56:44.401
My third wife, an accomplished
bitch from Mumbai,

56:44.735 --> 56:46.945
Has taken affection for him.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.948
I felt it was not for fishing.

56:50.115 --> 56:53.452
I gave him the worst chores,
like emptying the fish.

56:53.702 --> 56:56.121
I tried to discourage him.
Nothing to do !

56:57.080 --> 56:58.707
What did he like?

56:59.082 --> 56:59.958
All !

57:01.918 --> 57:03.045
The sea, of course.

57:04.421 --> 57:06.965
Get up before daylight,
peel with cold.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.801
Wrapped up, unable to move.

57:11.553 --> 57:13.472
The jokes of the old.

57:14.389 --> 57:17.059
The kind of men you can trust.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.525
- You want some ?
- Thank you.

57:38.080 --> 57:38.955
Spinks!

57:39.665 --> 57:40.540
Mrs.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.043
Based on the initial decoding,

57:43.418 --> 57:46.713
These numbers can indicate the
directions and the altitude.

57:47.297 --> 57:50.008
- Not GPS coordinates?
- I need the code.

57:50.425 --> 57:52.469
We have the flight plan for this drone.

57:52.761 --> 57:55.639
The modules of the other
three must be similar.

57:55.806 --> 57:59.059
With scheduled flights, but
without longitude or latitude.

57:59.976 --> 58:01.478
And without these parameters,

58:01.812 --> 58:03.855
We have no idea of
the drop point.

58:04.022 --> 58:08.193
There's a section of a
waterway, but that's it.

58:08.568 --> 58:10.278
Did you try to improve the image?

58:11.238 --> 58:12.864
It is pixelated. Jelly.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.242
We thought of Italian cities.

58:15.409 --> 58:18.036
Crossed by a river
like Rome or Florence.

58:18.161 --> 58:21.164
- But it does not fit, so...
- Barovski has spun.

58:21.581 --> 58:23.625
All the faster he knows
he is being tracked down.

58:24.084 --> 58:26.461
Three crates of drones,
and boxes of arms.

58:26.712 --> 58:28.964
He had time to get
them out of Italy.

58:31.133 --> 58:33.802
The murders of Barovski
in Ukraine are the key.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.388
After all these years,
he will take revenge.

58:36.555 --> 58:39.641
To proclaim to the Russians:
"I can destroy you."

58:41.685 --> 58:45.397
This picture could be Moscow.
I will share this info.

58:45.564 --> 58:46.857
And ask for help.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.985
Cummings, you will
coordinate the

58:50.152 --> 58:52.404
From the Downing Street
and Washington agreement.

58:53.113 --> 58:53.989
Yes Madam.

58:57.117 --> 58:59.661
Let's hope Barovski
is not too far!

59:17.679 --> 59:20.474
R Cummings Director
of Operations

59:46.124 --> 59:49.211
You're quite shocked,
Agent Cummings.

59:49.586 --> 59:53.256
Your Baron Orlov is dead,
and now you are my mole.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.634
My traitor MI6.

59:56.343 --> 59:58.970
If you doubt the danger to you,

59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.390
I have a copy of this file

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.934
Ready to be sent to your boss,

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.352
Gisela Summer.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.813
You must return the device

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.649
That your colleagues
stole from me in Rome.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:15.362
It contains a secret that
they must not discover.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.448
The more it stays in your services,

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.992
The more it increases the
risks of my mission.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.953
I shall have my revenge,

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.664
And you have a chance to survive,

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.708
If you execute my orders.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.902
- Messages ?
- On your desk.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:00.032
Hello.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:02.659
Mrs.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.286
Cummings.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.832
The Services are conducting a joint
investigation with the Kremlin.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.418
- We're connecting.
- Yes, as soon as possible.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.338
But I think I've
found something.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.506
Be more specific.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.718
This concerns collaboration
with Moscow,

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:20.969
And its effectiveness.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:23.471
I know your
involvement, and so...

01:01:24.513 --> 01:01:25.389
I found that.

01:01:25.514 --> 01:01:28.559
He is an American
journalist held captive

01:01:28.934 --> 01:01:30.561
Nearly a year in Chechnya.

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:32.271
- Thomas Miller.
- Yes.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:35.149
Moscow had denied knowledge
of his place of detention.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.985
- That was nonsense.
- Absolutely.

01:01:38.944 --> 01:01:43.324
Released in exchange of information,
after lengthy negotiations.

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:45.034
What maybe erasing...

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.370
The embarrassment due to the Iranian disaster...

01:01:48.245 --> 01:01:49.288
Mrs.

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.958
I can see the return of a
hostage in his family,

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.378
But I will call.
Thanks, Cummings.

01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:58.381
Thank you Madam.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.139
UZBEKISTAN

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:10.351
Miller weighed 81 Kilos
before his capture.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.728
I bet he's lost...

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:14.438
Say eight or nine?

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:17.817
He will be cared for and
fed at the embassy.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.320
Do the Russians have
a sense of accuracy?

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:30.997
That's Miller.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.290
What is this mess ?

01:02:33.874 --> 01:02:35.793
But whore, who are...?

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:39.672
Shaolin,

01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:42.717
Your Kung-Fu does not look
too much to the point.

01:02:43.884 --> 01:02:45.261
Fuck, no!

01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:03.696
Team spirit.

01:03:09.493 --> 01:03:10.369
Stratton?

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.290
I'm Borodin Pavel.
Agent Volkov.

01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:17.293
I'm sorry, but Mr. Miller
interests me more.

01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:20.129
Of course.
Do you have the module?

01:03:23.215 --> 01:03:25.009
It is a bit in a bad state.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:28.304
These Chechens must have
wanted to spoil his return.

01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:30.473
No risk of photos.

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:31.891
Mr. Miller?

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.018
Mr. Thomas Miller?

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.728
From Indianapolis to Indiana?

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.647
You will be treated at the embassy.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:44.945
"Your captors have beaten you?"
- Yes, but it's okay.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:53.120
The module of control of the drone
and our fiches on Barovski.

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:03.422
It is very dangerous,
but it will be damaged.

01:04:06.842 --> 01:04:07.843
Let's go !

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.436
Shit !

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.563
It turned into a complete fiasco!

01:04:20.314 --> 01:04:22.650
How did Barovsky succeed?

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.443
I have my own idea.
Aggy,

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:27.029
You can warn Summer?
We're back.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.042
I listen to your reasoning.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:43.379
First the ambush to Hasht Bandi.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.716
It is clear that Barovsky
knew how to find us there.

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:49.969
Then the exchange of yesterday
with the so-called Russian agents.

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:51.679
Warned them too.

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:54.890
These two missions were
classified top-secret.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:58.269
The only external person
to be aware of it

01:04:58.894 --> 01:04:59.770
Is Cummings.

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:02.606
As for the new axis of
research on the drone,

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:06.027
It was Cummings who
hung them in the area.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.571
The first time, Marty
Sturgess was killed.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:12.783
- Lucky yesterday...
"These accusations are very serious!

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:15.578
What's going on, Stratton?

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.998
It is known that Barovski
holds four boxes of arms,

01:05:19.623 --> 01:05:21.000
But only three drones.

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:25.087
Yesterday's operation
took a long time.

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.965
- And effort to...
- A module that has become useless.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:29.633
On the surface, yes.

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:32.928
But if he wanted to take it from us,

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.680
He must have a reason.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:36.515
Review everything on this module.

01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:39.602
Put it to pieces.
Find what escapes us.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.271
We started, ma'am.
The material is loaded.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.565
I'll talk to Cummings.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.244
Cummings is gone.

01:05:57.536 --> 01:06:00.498
We see him passing security,
and his phone is cut off.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.041
He will join Barovski.

01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:04.919
Barovski and the drones
remain our priority.

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:05.961
Yes Madam.

01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:08.422
Look at that.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.261
Longitude and latitudes.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:15.930
It's rotating.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.224
No, in the opposite direction.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.022
That will give us the target.

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:28.943
Oh my God, London!

01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:37.535
Office of Summer.

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.168
Preprogrammed modules.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.713
It does not require human intervention.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:52.425
Barovski can disappear
immediately after the launch.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:00.933
He goes along this area.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.111
The Thames estuary!

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:17.283
Boat contacted for
violation by Coast Guard.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.161
- Stop tracking tag.
- Did they approach him?

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:23.622
The captain declared
a brief power cut,

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:25.041
Before sending a unit.

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:29.295
"Baffin Strait",
coming from Amsterdam.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:32.256
Communicate your position to SBS.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:35.468
Authorized mooring
on Canary Wharf.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:36.969
East London.

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:52.276
- Ground support?
- Send two units.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:54.278
In coordination with Stratton.

01:08:00.284 --> 01:08:02.495
Here Dauphin 1. Follow the orders.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.873
Dauphin 2.
Confirmation of attack to port.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.252
Dauphin 1 and 3.
Priority: secure the three drones.

01:08:13.005 --> 01:08:16.175
Be careful not to
let X-rays escape.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.595
Any damage to the crates would
cause the gas to spread.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.848
If this happens, you will
have to destroy them.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.309
The anti-tank explosive
is the only way.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.479
I see two drones.
One on the dock, the other on a crane.

01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:32.733
Take a look at the radiation!

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:34.734
Let's move !

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:48.290
2-1, X-rays to port!

01:08:58.759 --> 01:08:59.844
Barovski!

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.354
I have them aiming!

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:12.333
Come on! Come on!

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.139
Boat 2 destroyed.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:45.324
Jumped up !

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.752
Come on! Come on!

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.049
We will not cross the bridge!

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:05.219
I did not get Barovski.
The drone is online!

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:09.390
Fucking bridge!

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.520
Barovski left by the canals.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:23.738
Zero, I want a vehicle
for Surrey Quay.

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:25.906
Land searches are continuing.

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:49.889
Come on!

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.321
Hi Aggy. Are you OK honey ?

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:08.574
Started.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:36.394
Barovsky is gone.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.980
You should have run away
when there was still time.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.857
Aggy, listen to me.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.860
I never wanted that.
It was not expected.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:46.862
It was not my plan.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:48.906
You trust me.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.950
You must believe me.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.536
You have a reserved place in hell.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:55.913
Together with Barovski.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.250
The next one on the left.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.919
Turn left. The !

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.404
At least we have two drones off.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.363
Aggy?

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:30.573
Let me redeem you.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.868
- Help us find the drone.
- Stopped !

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.746
Please...
You know he trapped me.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.539
He made me sing.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.583
Even Orlov of the Secret Service,

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.918
Did not know what he would incur.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.880
It was not supposed to end like this.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:47.673
I never approved.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.966
So do not do it.

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:52.636
You do not have to.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:53.971
Yes, exactly !

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.307
You see there?

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.519
What are you looking for.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:04.607
Oh, Aggy...

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.943
I do not want to do that.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:13.699
What's this ?

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.704
What is this place?

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:34.053
That's... absolution!

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:40.893
Aggy?

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:44.397
I'm here.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.606
Aggy, are you okay?

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.900
Aggy, can you hear me?

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.695
Cummings is dead.
He pointed to a place for me.

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:52.154
Brothel!

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:53.698
Started !

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:59.120
Be very careful, it
costs a lot of money.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:20.641
Stratton, I'm at the bus
depot to Camden High Street.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.728
Spinks. Trace Aggy's phone.

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:32.486
Garage on Canal Street.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:37.783
Garage Canal Street.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.201
On Lime Street.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.456
Four men.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:46.959
And Barovsky.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:35.383
I see the drone.

01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:37.718
I repeat: I see the drone.

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:46.727
Let's move.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.196
Come on! Get out!

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:02.535
Aggy, help us find you.
Give us a clue.

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:12.336
I need a landmark.
Panel, building, monument.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:15.881
Come on, give us a track.

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.511
Trafalgar Square. The Nelson column.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.056
There are too many buses!

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.062
I have an idea !

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:36.485
Locates the flash on my camera.

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:50.166
Spinks, is the bus close?

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.295
His signal is on yours.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:09.977
She's there !

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.897
- Bus 9, right there.
- We got the bus, we follow him.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:14.357
Aggy, we've spotted you.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:51.935
- We follow them through the park.
- Anti-terrorist brigade within 4 min.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.855
This is the best option.
Fewer people than on the streets.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:57.607
Authorization to shoot.

01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:02.070
We will have them !

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:00.313
Hank, block the bus!

01:21:07.737 --> 01:21:09.656
Hank, grenade!

01:21:32.595 --> 01:21:35.265
We lost touch, 045.

01:21:35.932 --> 01:21:38.727
Security Code 45. Done.

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:47.569
No answer, sir.
I repeat, no contact.

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:50.864
Anti-terrorist brigade in 2 min.

01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:17.182
Oh fuck !

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:18.600
Shit.

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:48.106
Password

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.861
Error

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:12.422
Come on! In position !

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:18.511
Move!

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.351
Fire on target!

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:27.145
Fire!

01:25:15.151 --> 01:25:16.361
Where are you going to rest?

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:19.698
Three weeks of recovery.

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:24.536
That is, my sofa, a
good book and tea.

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.914
All this seems very pleasant.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.000
Indeed.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:32.711
We would not have gone without you.

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:36.131
Thanks, John.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:46.349
During your recovery on the sofa,

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.687
Maybe you want a
well-watered dinner?

01:25:52.605 --> 01:25:53.606
If that is the case,

01:25:54.774 --> 01:25:57.819
Remember what a wise man
told me about Napoleon.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.571
It was what ?

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:02.949
Show yourself, and
see what happens.

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.123
They send you where after?

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:13.126
In fact,

01:26:13.793 --> 01:26:15.795
I would hang out here for a moment.

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:18.214
I like the climate.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:21.926
And if they send me home,

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.636
I will have problems.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:25.805
That would be a pity.

01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:27.599
You were right.

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:30.352
- What about ?
- Marty.

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:33.563
Despite all these events,

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:36.816
It's not over.

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:39.611
No.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.197
It never is.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:48.995
In spite of everything... It was good!

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:55.168
Come, you two!
Fishing is not waiting!
