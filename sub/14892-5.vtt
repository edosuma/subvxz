Yes, I’ll hold.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.910
Oh, yes, hello.
Ah, uh, yes.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.812
And would you please
tell Dr. Ives

11:18.845 --> 11:20.781
that we are on our way
to the hospital

11:20.814 --> 11:22.348
and would he please
meet us there?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.050
Okay, thank you.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.151
Oh, I’m fine.
I’m fine.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.821
Are you,
are you okay?

11:27.854 --> 11:29.189
Alright, thank you very much.
Bye‐bye.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.358
Boy, you are gone.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.627
Well, I will be
in just a second.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.196
Who do you think you are fooling
with this "I am in control" act?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.397
I am in control.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.832
No, you just think
you’re in control.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.267
You’re in the midst
of a major breakdown.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.469
‐What?
‐And you’re in denial.

11:43.504 --> 11:45.071
‐No, I’m not.
‐See?

11:47.273 --> 11:50.811
Oh, my God, you’re right.
What am I denying?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.379
Alright, you are facing
one of the most

11:53.413 --> 11:56.016
important moments
of your adult life

11:56.049 --> 11:58.251
and you are starting
to realize

11:58.284 --> 12:01.822
that millions
of things can go wrong.

12:01.855 --> 12:02.889
What can go wrong?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.157
Well, just getting
to the hospital.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.859
What if you
run out of gas?

12:05.892 --> 12:08.228
What if you get stuck
in a traffic jam?

12:08.261 --> 12:09.963
What if the transmission
falls out?

12:09.996 --> 12:12.498
What if I hit a cow
and then I have to bury it

12:12.533 --> 12:13.934
and comfort the other cows?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.035
That’s right,
that’s right.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.202
Just go with those
feelings, buddy.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.505
Just‐just let it happen.
Go ahead.

12:18.539 --> 12:22.108
Oh, cousin, oh, cousin,
I‐I‐I didn’t mean to hit her.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.777
She ran out
in front of my car.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.913
She was, she was chasing
a salt lick.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.885
One minute she was a happy,
productive little heifer

12:33.086 --> 12:35.355
and the next, ground chuck.

12:38.224 --> 12:39.993
That’s good.
That’s good.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.130
Guys, the most amazing thing
just happened.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.933
Mary Anne had the baby
in the car.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.536
‐What?
‐Balki, you have a son.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.478
Did you hear that, cousin?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.113
I have a son.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.949
Well, congratulations.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.350
Well, come on, we’ve gotta
get ’em both to the hospital.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.186
Yeah, but‐but what if
something goes wrong?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.589
What if, uh, what if,
uh, I run out of gas

13:08.622 --> 13:13.126
or‐or the transmission on my car
falls out or I hit another cow?

13:13.159 --> 13:15.061
The other cows
know about me now.

13:17.598 --> 13:20.033
Okay, Balki, Balki, Balki.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.135
Just get a hold
of yourself.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.572
Yeah, yeah. You’re right.
You’re right. Gotcha. I’m fine.

13:25.606 --> 13:28.141
‐Okay, let’s go.
‐Okay.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.159
Balki, I’ve been going
over this and over this.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.861
There has to be
something different

13:47.894 --> 13:50.363
that Mary Anne did that
made her go into labor so early.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.933
I’ve got to find out
what it was and do it.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.635
I’ve got to have
this baby now.

13:54.668 --> 13:58.171
Well, Jennifer, no one wants you
to have this baby more than I do

13:58.204 --> 14:02.308
but I don’t think anything
Mary Anne did had anything to do

14:02.342 --> 14:04.310
with her going into labor.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.615
Maybe you’re right, sweetheart.

14:08.649 --> 14:11.017
Could you fix me a Pop Tart?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.620
And cut it into little tiny
squares like I like it?

14:13.654 --> 14:15.255
Well, of course, honey.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.960
Anything for my little
mother‐to‐be.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.562
’My little mother‐to‐be.’

14:24.164 --> 14:25.999
Balki, tell me everything
Mary Anne did yesterday

14:26.032 --> 14:27.634
up until she went
into labor.

14:27.668 --> 14:31.271
Okay, but first I have a really
important question for you.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.608
Is this the cutest nose you’ve
ever seen in your life or what?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.142
It’s adorable.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.145
Don’t worry
he’ll grow into it.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.650
Balki, what did
Mary Anne do yesterday?

14:43.684 --> 14:46.252
She had my child.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.388
Little Robespierre
Boinki Bartokomous...

14:49.990 --> 14:51.257
A‐K‐A...

14:51.291 --> 14:53.459
(both)
The cutest baby in the world.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.129
Oh‐ho‐ho.

14:56.162 --> 15:00.400
I’ve taken a photograph of him
every hour for the last two days

15:00.433 --> 15:03.670
and I’ve just realized
if I flip them real fast

15:03.704 --> 15:05.506
you can see him grow.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.444
‐Baby’s first steps.
‐Oh, okay, okay, okay.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.580
Balki, I need to know
everything Mary Anne did

15:13.614 --> 15:16.617
leading up to the birth of
little Robespierre Boinki.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.052
Well, let’s see, uh,
she didn’t do much of anything

15:19.085 --> 15:20.721
until we went to the fair.

15:20.754 --> 15:24.290
Mary Anne spent $36
at the coin toss

15:24.324 --> 15:27.961
and she won
a moustache comb which...

15:27.994 --> 15:29.495
...which she gave
to the Bearded Lady

15:29.530 --> 15:31.031
’cause she’s such
a giving soul.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.401
And all that time,
unbeknownst to us

15:35.435 --> 15:37.403
Little Robespierre Boinki
was planning

15:37.437 --> 15:39.606
to make his little entrance
into the world.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.274
[laughs]
Look at those cheeks.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.744
Don’t you just wanna
pinch them?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.078
I wanna have
my own little baby

15:45.111 --> 15:46.212
with little cheeks
to pinch.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.648
I wanna have
48 pictures

15:47.681 --> 15:49.382
of my own baby.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.217
Forty‐nine if you count
the double exposure.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.354
Look, see where it’s like
a car coming through his head.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.356
Balki, you could help me
have this baby.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.591
Huh?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.359
You could help
little Robespierre Boinki

15:59.392 --> 16:00.460
have a little cousin
to play with.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.330
All you have to do is
just tell me what Mary Anne did.

16:05.766 --> 16:07.634
After the coin toss

16:07.668 --> 16:11.772
we went for
a helium balloon ride

16:11.805 --> 16:14.708
and then she wanted a corn dog
which I really don’t understand.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.512
’Cause it’s not corn
and it’s not a dog, what is it?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.380
Jennifer, are you
still trying to figure out

16:20.413 --> 16:22.182
what Mary Anne did?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.784
‐Because I don’t‐‐
‐Balloon ride.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.485
It makes perfect sense.

16:25.519 --> 16:26.753
She went up in a balloon,
the air pressure changed

16:26.787 --> 16:28.755
she went into labor.

16:28.789 --> 16:30.490
Well, that is ridiculous.

16:30.524 --> 16:32.458
A‐a balloon ride couldn’t
possibly have made

16:32.492 --> 16:34.127
Mary Anne go into labor.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.395
Cousin, it makes perfect sense.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.231
It happens to Myposian
astronauts all the time.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.034
We have a birth
on every shuttle.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.736
Of course, they only go up
as far as we can throw them

16:42.769 --> 16:45.138
but still the principle
is exactly the same.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.406
Come on, Jennifer,
let’s go get

16:46.439 --> 16:48.308
little Robespierre Boinki
a little cousin.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.543
Come on, we’ll put them
in a crib

16:49.576 --> 16:51.377
make them do the Dance of Joy
with their little booties...

16:51.411 --> 16:54.615
Hey. Hey. Now, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

16:54.648 --> 16:58.519
What, are, are you two
out of your minds?

16:58.552 --> 17:01.622
I‐I am not gonna let my wife
float hundreds of feet

17:01.655 --> 17:03.824
in the air i‐i‐in a,
in a balloon.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.358
Cousin, it’s not
hundreds of feet.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.160
It’s just fifty feet
up and it goes

17:07.193 --> 17:09.630
and‐and there’s rope
holding it to the ground.

17:09.663 --> 17:13.199
You know, I bet, I bet we could
see the hospital from it.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.268
Maybe‐maybe I could ask
Mary Anne to take a picture

17:15.300 --> 17:16.803
of me from
little Robespierre Boinki’s

17:16.837 --> 17:18.371
point of view.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.742
Come on, Larry,
we have to get to the fair.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.377
Now‐now, sweetheart,
listen‐listen.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.246
I know you are
not gonna to like this

17:26.279 --> 17:29.750
but I absolutely forbid you
to go up in a balloon.

17:31.852 --> 17:34.254
Now, is‐is‐is that gonna be
a problem, sweetheart?

17:38.759 --> 17:40.460
What do you think?

17:42.896 --> 17:44.397
I think we’re going
for a balloon ride.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.432
You see the eyelashes?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.334
‐Yes, they’re adorable.
‐You see those...

18:00.547 --> 18:02.516
Will you guys please hurry up?

18:02.549 --> 18:03.850
We’re coming, sweetheart.

18:03.884 --> 18:06.186
Look at my little boy’s little
buttocks. They’re so cute...

18:09.255 --> 18:11.391
I don’t believe this.
The balloon is closed.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.527
Uh‐oh, looks like
Howard took the day off.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.728
(Jennifer)
’Who’s Howard?’

18:14.761 --> 18:16.496
Well, he runs
the balloon ride.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.399
He’s also a wine connoisseur,
philosopher

18:19.432 --> 18:21.868
and his thumbs are
double‐jointed.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.770
They bend all the way back.

18:23.804 --> 18:25.271
Mine won’t reach.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.373
‐Sure they will.
‐Oh.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.744
Okay. Now let’s‐let’s
just forget Howard. Let’s go.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.646
I’m not leaving here until
I’ve gone up in this balloon.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.881
Now‐now‐now where do we find
this Howard person?

18:34.915 --> 18:37.317
Sweetheart, we are in
no condition to be

18:37.350 --> 18:40.621
running all over Chicago looking
for some clown named Howard.

18:40.654 --> 18:43.890
Excuse me, cousin,
Howard is not the clown.

18:43.924 --> 18:45.526
Arthur is the clown.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.894
He’s right over there,
next to the fortune teller.

18:47.928 --> 18:49.596
‐Arthur? Arthur?
‐’Thank you, thank you.’

18:49.630 --> 18:51.297
‐Cousin Larry needs to laugh.
‐’Thank you, thank you.’

18:51.331 --> 18:54.267
Look, look, cousin.
See?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.769
Here’s what we’re gonna do.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.804
We’re just gonna go home,
get a good night’s rest

18:57.838 --> 18:59.940
and‐and just be here bright
and early tomorrow morning.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.942
‐Exactly what I’d suggest.
‐Thank you.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.243
If today didn’t happen to be

19:03.276 --> 19:04.911
the last day of the fair.

19:04.945 --> 19:06.880
Oh, God.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.382
Oh, God, I’m never
gonna have this baby.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.317
I’m never gonna have
48 pictures.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.220
I’m never gonna have any
chubby little cheeks to pinch.

19:14.254 --> 19:18.725
I’m just gonna have this huge
stomach for the rest of my life.

19:18.759 --> 19:20.293
No, you won’t, Jennifer.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.728
I’ll take you up
in the balloon myself.

19:21.762 --> 19:23.296
‐Oh, thank you, Balki.
‐Yeah.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.298
No. Hey, now.
Hey, let’s not get crazy.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.204
It’s too late, Larry.
I am way past crazy.

19:31.237 --> 19:34.708
I’m going up in this balloon
with or without you.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.510
Alright, alright.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.478
Balki, Balki? Are‐are
you sure you can do this?

19:38.512 --> 19:40.847
Well, of course I am.
Don’t be ridiculous.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.751
Just like the balloons
we have on Mypos.

19:44.785 --> 19:46.987
Only ours don’t have
any air in them

19:47.020 --> 19:48.822
and they don’t have
any baskets.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.427
We call them
drop cloths.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.362
‐Let’s get going.
‐Alright.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.765
Alright, wait, wait.
Let us help you in.

19:58.799 --> 20:01.702
Here. Come on, Balki.
Just, just, okay.

20:01.735 --> 20:03.770
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, sweetheart.

20:03.804 --> 20:04.738
Here we go.
Alright, alright, I’ve got her.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.540
‐I just got these two back‐‐
‐Just get in.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.474
Just get in and help her
in the basket.

20:08.509 --> 20:09.743
Help her in the basket now.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.314
Here, I got you, sweetheart.
I got you.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.250
Alright, alright,
here we go. Here we go.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.253
‐Okay, okay, Jennifer.
‐Alright, there you go.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.922
Okay. Good, good, good.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.557
Okay.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.658
‐Good girl.
‐Balki, help me in.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.459
Come on.
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.896
[panting]

20:36.570 --> 20:38.539
Alright, wait there, sweetheart,
Wait there, we’ll help you.

20:38.572 --> 20:41.542
We’ll help you. Hang on. Hang
on, we‐we’ll be right there.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.510
[indistinct mumbling]

20:48.782 --> 20:50.917
Alright, come on,
let’s just get in. Just get in.

20:50.951 --> 20:52.719
Here we go.

20:52.753 --> 20:56.723
Oh, Larry. Um, there...
There we go.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.325
Okay. Okay.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.294
[panting]

21:03.029 --> 21:07.333
Okay, now let’s see,
um, yeah, yeah.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.569
It’s all coming back
to me now.

21:08.602 --> 21:11.872
