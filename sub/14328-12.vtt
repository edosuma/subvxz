Timmy: ONE, TWO, 3!

19:20.225 --> 19:23.028
{\an1}OH, SO THAT'S WHAT
"ON 3" MEANS.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.796
{\an1}TIMMY, YOU KNOW
I STILL HAVE KEYS

19:24.863 --> 19:25.797
TO THIS PLACE.

19:25.864 --> 19:26.798
YEAH, I KNOW.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.034
ALL RIGHT, MAMA COSMA,

19:29.101 --> 19:30.903
WHERE'S BIG DADDY?!

19:30.969 --> 19:33.739
{\an1}[SLURPING]

19:33.805 --> 19:34.940
BIG DADDY?

19:35.007 --> 19:37.209
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEING
HELD AGAINST YOUR WILL.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.344
{\an1}HANG ON THERE,
YOU LITTLE MEATBALL.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.513
{\an1}I AIN'T
KIDNAPPED NO MORE.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.514
BIG DADDY'S HERE

19:42.581 --> 19:44.583
{\an1}BECAUSE BIG DADDY
WANTS TO BE.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.185
BIG DADDY ALSO LIKES
REFERRING TO HIMSELF

19:47.252 --> 19:48.787
AS BIG DADDY.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.255
{\an1}OH, SURE.

19:50.322 --> 19:52.624
{\an1}HE WAS KIDNAPPED
AT FIRST,

19:52.691 --> 19:55.928
{\an1}BUT THEN WE REALIZED WE BOTH
HAD SOMETHING IN COMMON.

19:55.994 --> 19:59.698
{\an1}WE BOTH CAN'T STAND
WHO OUR CHILDREN MARRIED.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.067
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:02.134 --> 20:03.969
IT MEANS I DON'T LIKE YOU.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.738
AND WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:06.805 --> 20:09.808
SO, I DECIDED TO PLAY
ALONG AND STAY HERE.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.143
LONG ENOUGH SO THAT WANDA

20:11.209 --> 20:13.045
{\an1}WOULD GET SO WRAPPED
IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS

20:13.111 --> 20:15.080
{\an1}THAT IT WOULD
BREAK YOU TWO UP.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.183
{\an1}IT'S NOT A GREAT PLAN,
BUT I'M HAPPY HERE.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.818
MMM!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.253
{\an1}YOU SHOULD
TASTE HER VEAL.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.190
{\an5}BUT WHAT ABOUT
WANDA GIRLING UP
THE BUSINESS?

20:25.257 --> 20:26.191
WHAT?!

20:26.258 --> 20:27.793

THAT'S RIGHT.

20:40.138 --> 20:41.340
AND YOUR BOYS
ARE SO UPSET,

20:41.406 --> 20:42.507
THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE HER OUT--

20:42.574 --> 20:43.542
TONIGHT!

20:43.609 --> 20:45.844
I CAN'T LET THEM
TAKE OUT MY LITTLE GIRL.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.312
WITHOUT A VIDEO CREW

20:47.379 --> 20:49.214

{\an1}JUST IN CASE
THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL--

20:54.386 --> 20:56.922

TO JUSTICE.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.859
YOU'RE AN EVIL,
MANIPULATING SHREW...

21:00.926 --> 21:04.196

LOVES THAT ABOUT YOU.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.530
