WAS HE SHORT, OLD, WHAT?

11:19.374 --> 11:21.724
NAH. YOUNGER.

11:21.768 --> 11:25.989
LANKY, DORK-LIKE.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.687
LUKE: HE'S
A MAD HATTER IMPOSTER,

11:27.730 --> 11:30.341
WHICH MEANS HE FOUND
THE HAT.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.952
MAN: NO, NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:31.995 --> 11:34.476
NO! NO, NO, NO!

11:34.519 --> 11:39.742
WHAT--WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU JUST DO?

11:39.786 --> 11:42.397
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
MORE DISTURBING--THAT,

11:42.440 --> 11:43.920
THAT HE POSTED IT,
OR THAT ALICE

11:43.964 --> 11:45.574
ACTUALLY HAS A FANBOY.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.619
SORRY. HOW DOES A TOP HAT
MAKE SOMEONE

11:47.663 --> 11:49.447
KILL THEIR
DRINKING BUDDY?

11:49.491 --> 11:52.450
RIGHT. MEET
JERVIS TETCH,

11:52.494 --> 11:55.497
AKA THE ORIGINAL
MAD HATTER.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.933
NOW ACCORDING
TO MY DAD,

11:56.977 --> 11:59.196
JERVIS TETCH WAS
A TINY, INSECURE,

11:59.240 --> 12:00.894
AND ANNOYING
NEUROSCIENTIST.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.722
HE FELT LIKE THE WORLD
WASN'T LISTENING TO HIM,

12:02.765 --> 12:04.593
SO HE DEVELOPED
MIND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY

12:04.636 --> 12:06.290
TO FORCE THEM
TO LISTEN.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.205
HE BUILT IT DIRECTLY
INTO HIS HAT.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.425
OK. THIS SAYS BRUCE HAD
THE HAT DEPROGRAMMED

12:10.468 --> 12:12.035
BEFORE HE PUT IT
INTO THE TROPHY CASE.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.168
MY GUESS IS THAT
THE TECHNOLOGY LATCHES

12:14.211 --> 12:16.518
TO THE BRAIN ACTIVITY
OF THE FIRST PERSON
WHO PUTS IT ON.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.781
IF THE HAT IS TECHNOLOGY,
CAN'T WE

12:18.825 --> 12:20.435
HACK IT OR WHATEVER?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.872
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
UPLOADED TO THE CLOUD.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
WE FIRST NEED TO GET
THE HAT OFF HIS HEAD.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.268
WELL, HOW WITHOUT FALLING
VICTIM TO IT IN THE PROCESS?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.749
128 HERTZ OF FREQUENCY.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.316
YOUR DAD FIGURED OUT
HOW TO DISRUPT

12:32.360 --> 12:34.057
THE HAT'S RADIO WAVES.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.146
OK. SO WE KNOW THE HOW
AND THE WHAT.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.844
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW
THE WHERE.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.802
SO IF I WERE
AN ALICE-OBSESSED

12:39.846 --> 12:42.805
MAD HATTER WANNABE,
WHERE WOULD I GO?

12:44.502 --> 12:47.201
ALICE: I WAS
WONDERING WHEN YOU'D
COME CRAWLING BACK.

12:47.244 --> 12:50.465
YOU STORMED OUT OF HERE
IN SUCH A...HUFF LAST TIME,

12:50.508 --> 12:52.597
I WAS WORRIED IT WAS
SOMETHING I SAID.

12:52.641 --> 12:56.819
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING
WITH YOUR MAD HATTER SUPERFAN.

12:56.863 --> 13:00.431
I TOLD YOU
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.565
WELL, HE CERTAINLY KNOWS
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.480
HAVE YOU WATCHED
THE NEWS?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.177
MY IDENTITY'S
BEEN OUTED,

13:07.221 --> 13:09.136
AND SOME PEOPLE
ACTUALLY APPRECIATE

13:09.179 --> 13:11.573
THAT I'M JUST A GIRL
STANDING IN FRONT

13:11.616 --> 13:13.096
OF A PSYCHIATRIC WARD,
ASKING THEM NOT TO

13:13.140 --> 13:14.968
FRY HER BRAIN.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.057
-UH-HUH.
-OH, COME ON.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.582
WE BOTH KNOW I'M
UTTERLY HELPLESS
BEHIND THESE WALLS.

13:20.625 --> 13:25.152
YOU CAME BECAUSE YOU
WANT ALL THE DIRTY DEETS
ON MOMMY D.

13:25.195 --> 13:28.764
I SAW MY BIRTH MOTHER'S
DEATH CERTIFICATE.

13:28.808 --> 13:33.247
NIA A. WILDER.
DIED THE DAY I WAS BORN.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.858
IF YOU SAY SO, DEAR.

13:35.902 --> 13:39.470
WHAT IS THIS? HMM?

13:39.514 --> 13:42.038
ARE YOU LONELY?
YOU NEED TO KEEP SOMEBODY

13:42.082 --> 13:43.779
ON A LEASH TO STOP YOU
FROM SLIPPING

13:43.823 --> 13:45.302
INTO TOTAL ISOLATION?

13:45.346 --> 13:47.609
HEH HEH HEH.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.046
AM I LONELY?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.961
LOOK AT YOUR LIFE.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.789
YOUR CLOSEST
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

13:53.833 --> 13:55.791
IS AN EX
IN WITNESS PROTECTION.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.054
YOU HAVE NO ONE.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.969
I GAVE YOU SOMEONE
TO FILL THE HOLE

14:00.013 --> 14:02.929
IN YOUR LITTLE,
EMPTY HEART.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.018
I HAVE MY FRIENDS.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.237
LUKE AND MARY?

14:07.281 --> 14:09.370
RIGHT. WHO YOU'RE
SO CLOSE TO

14:09.413 --> 14:10.719
YOU COULDN'T EVEN TELL
YOUR BIRTH MOTHER

14:10.762 --> 14:12.199
LIED TO YOU
ALL THESE YEARS.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.203
-WE'RE DONE HERE.
-SOUNDS LIKE YOUR MAD HATTER'S

14:16.246 --> 14:18.248
PLANNING A TEA PARTY.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.820
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HE'S PLANNING, ALICE?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.735
[SIGHS]

14:26.778 --> 14:28.868
I JUST KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.695
WHICH IS?

14:33.698 --> 14:35.439
MARY: IT WOULD BE
SO REFRESHING

14:35.483 --> 14:36.919
IF A SUPERVILLAIN
ACTUALLY SAID

14:36.963 --> 14:39.226
WHAT THEY MEANT FOR ONCE.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.010
WHAT TEA PARTY?

14:41.054 --> 14:42.490
SOPHIE: NOT TO KILL
THE MOOD,

14:42.533 --> 14:43.926
BUT THE LAST TEA PARTY
ALICE HAD,

14:43.970 --> 14:45.493
SHE POISONED YOUR MOM.

14:45.536 --> 14:49.149
SO WHAT, HE'S MAKING
IT PERSONAL, MORE PUBLIC?

14:49.192 --> 14:51.107
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD ASK MY DAD.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.457
MAYBE HE'S CHATTED
ABOUT IT WITH ALICE

14:53.501 --> 14:55.285
IN THEIR CORRESPONDENCE.

14:55.329 --> 15:00.160
OK. YOU, MY DEAR,
ARE GRADUATING

15:00.203 --> 15:02.205
TOP OF YOUR CLASS,

15:02.249 --> 15:04.947
LOOKING FINE AS HELL
MIGHT I ADD,

15:04.991 --> 15:08.385
AND WE ARE STANDING
HERE TALKING
ABOUT ALICE.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.865
CAN WE NOT LET
THAT BITCH RUIN
THE BEST THING

15:09.909 --> 15:12.302
WE HAVE GOING ON
RIGHT NOW, PLEASE?

15:12.346 --> 15:14.957
FINE. SUBJECT CHANGE.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.351
WHO'S THIS DEJA GIRL
YOU DITCHED ME FOR
LAST NIGHT, HMM?

15:17.394 --> 15:18.787
I THOUGHT HER NAME
WAS RILEY.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.702
OH, NO. RILEY WAS
LAST WEEK.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.704
UM, EXCUSE ME.
I'M ALLOWED TO DATE

15:22.747 --> 15:24.314
MULTIPLE WOMEN
AT ONCE.

15:24.358 --> 15:27.013
SO I TAKE IT YOU
AND KATE ARE
NOT HAPPENING?

15:27.056 --> 15:29.189
OH, NO. THEY'RE GOOD.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.843
THEY'RE FRIENDS,
BUT IT'S TOO COMPLICATED

15:31.887 --> 15:33.367
FOR ANYTHING MORE
RIGHT NOW.

15:33.410 --> 15:38.198
THANK YOU, MARY.
YES TO ALL OF THAT.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.157
RYAN WILDER, I THINK
THIS IS THE MOST INTEREST

15:41.201 --> 15:43.681
YOU'VE EVER SHOWN
MY LOVE LIFE.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.814
AT LEAST SOMEBODY'S
GETTING SOME
AROUND HERE.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.905
YOU KNOW, THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT THIS
TEA PARTY THING,

15:49.949 --> 15:52.429
IF THERE'S ONE PERSON
WHO CAN PREDICT

15:52.473 --> 15:54.431
A LUNATIC'S NEXT MOVE,
IT'S ANOTHER

15:54.475 --> 15:56.129
CERTIFIABLE LUNATIC.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.434
THAT'S WHAT
I CAN'T SHAKE.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.870
SHE HAS NO REASON
TO MAKE THIS UP.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.960
SHE HAS EVERY REASON--

16:01.003 --> 16:02.918
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL
A GAME TO HER.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.572
SHE'S TRYING TO FEEL
RELEVANT BECAUSE

16:04.615 --> 16:06.356
SHE DOESN'T MATTER
ANYMORE.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.403
NOW SERIOUSLY,
DROP IT BEFORE Y'ALL
BOTH KILL MY BUZZ.

16:09.446 --> 16:13.973

A CHEAP-ASS BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.800
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON HER.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.367
I SHOULD GO PRACTICE
MY SPEECH.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.198
SOPHIE: WANT TO TELL
ME WHAT HAPPENED
AT ARKHAM?

16:24.809 --> 16:28.639
NOTHING BECAUSE
ALICE WAS UNHELPFUL

16:28.683 --> 16:30.119
AND PETULANT
AND EVERYTHING

16:30.163 --> 16:32.426
ONE WOULD EXPECT
ALICE TO BE.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.471
THEN IF SHE WAS
EVERYTHING YOU EXPECTED,

16:34.515 --> 16:36.473
HOW'D SHE GET
UNDER YOUR SKIN?

16:38.388 --> 16:39.955
RYAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

16:45.569 --> 16:48.224
SHE SAID
MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER,

16:48.268 --> 16:51.010
WHO DIED GIVING
BIRTH TO ME,

16:51.053 --> 16:53.012
WAS ACTUALLY
STILL ALIVE

16:53.055 --> 16:54.970
AND THAT SHE COVERED IT
ALL UP WITH A FAKE NAME

16:55.014 --> 16:57.755
SO I'D NEVER FIND HER.

16:57.799 --> 17:00.323
-DAMN.
-AND AS MUCH AS I DON'T BELIEVE

17:00.367 --> 17:01.890
A WORD ALICE SAYS--

17:01.933 --> 17:03.718
THERE'S STILL A PART
OF YOU THAT CAN'T HELP

17:03.761 --> 17:07.026

STILL ALIVE?"

17:10.072 --> 17:12.466
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO KNOW.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.555
I WAS TOLD
MY WHOLE LIFE
THAT MY DAD

17:14.598 --> 17:18.428
WAS OUT OF THE PICTURE
AND MY MOM DIED
IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.604
WHAT IF I HAVE
A FAMILY OUT THERE?

17:20.648 --> 17:23.694
WANT ME TO LOOK INTO IT
ON THE DL?

WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

18:48.039 --> 18:49.606

IT OFF THE STREETS

18:49.650 --> 18:51.304

20 YEARS AGO.

MARY: IN CONCLUSION,
MY FELLOW GRADUATES,

35:25.906 --> 35:28.169
I CHALLENGE EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

35:28.213 --> 35:31.564
TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
AND ASK YOURSELF

35:31.607 --> 35:36.917
"HOW CAN I END THIS DAY
BETTER THAN HOW IT STARTED?"

35:36.960 --> 35:40.181
WITH ONE MORE SAVED LIFE,

35:40.225 --> 35:44.490
ONE MORE CANCER-FREE SCAN,
ONE MORE SMILE

35:44.533 --> 35:48.102
BECAUSE IF WE CAN DO THAT
EVERY DAY,

35:48.146 --> 35:50.583
TOGETHER, WE CAN LEAVE
