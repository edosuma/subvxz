WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:05.070
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

00:07.140 --> 00:11.310
â™ª they all need
something to hold on to â™ª

00:11.312 --> 00:14.513
â™ª they all mean well

00:14.515 --> 00:17.549
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

00:17.551 --> 00:21.787
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

00:23.456 --> 00:25.724
â™ª

00:31.598 --> 00:34.166
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Mary:
<i>Nostradamus</i>

00:34.168 --> 00:38.237
Had a vision of your death,
brought about by me, if we wed.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.773
I will marry you son,
but not francis... Bash.

00:40.775 --> 00:44.410
Legitimize him and make him
the next king of France.

00:44.412 --> 00:48.113
You are throwing away everything
we had for superstition.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.051
We can't. Mary.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.786
Is no longer
a part of my life.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.821
Maurice:
<i>The king plans to behead her</i>
<i>within the week.</i>

00:55.823 --> 00:57.523
Francesca:
He's accused
you of adultery.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.725
Clarissa, dear, listen to me.
I'm your mother.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.226
Let yourself
be loved.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.595
It'll take us hours
to dig her a grave.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.130
There's no one around
to check us.

01:20.313 --> 01:23.682
Catherine:
<i>Make the blow sure and quick.</i>

01:23.684 --> 01:25.717
<i>Remember I've paid you extra.</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:28.654
<i>I don't want my children</i>

01:28.656 --> 01:30.589
<i>To see you hacking at me.</i>

01:31.424 --> 01:33.425
Don't break the clasp.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.861
I've promised this
to one of my ladies.

01:39.632 --> 01:40.766
Prawns?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.668
My youngest daughter
can't eat them.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.735
(sighs)

01:45.371 --> 01:47.372
The flowers.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.708
Full vases,
cascading bouquets--

01:49.710 --> 01:52.177
Where are they?
We were told by the king
to save them

01:52.179 --> 01:53.212
For the actual day.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.580
I need to see their placement.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.151
What about the wine?

01:59.153 --> 02:02.187
100 casks, flowing freely.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.756
The nobles will expect it.

02:04.758 --> 02:08.527
Yes, let them drink
and swim in my blood

02:08.529 --> 02:10.395
And wonder
who among them is next

02:10.397 --> 02:13.832
Once that bastard sebastian
takes the throne.

02:15.702 --> 02:16.902
(knocking on door)

02:16.904 --> 02:18.537
Come in, please.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.205
I'm nearly ready.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.608
No rush. They're bringing
the horses around.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.443
No rush?

02:24.445 --> 02:26.778
I feel awful we stopped at all.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.380
You swear you didn't
do it for me.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.615
Because I'm a terrible rider.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.916
We've gained time on horseback

02:30.918 --> 02:32.417
We never would have achieved
by carriage.

02:32.419 --> 02:33.785
But we needed rest.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.654
The horses were about
to drop as well.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.256
And, in truth,
it may not matter.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.591
My mother might already be dead.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.460
Don't say that.
You might think

02:41.462 --> 02:43.896
She deserves it
after all she's done. To mary.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.664
I think even mary would say
that's in the past.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.299
It will be soon

02:47.301 --> 02:49.801
If I can convince my father
to spare her life.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.637
It's unbelievable,
really.
What?

02:51.639 --> 02:52.938
If all goes well,

02:52.940 --> 02:55.574
Bash begins his life with mary
and I get exile.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.476
And my mother.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.477
(chuckles)

02:58.479 --> 03:00.245
Not for long.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.314
I'll set her up somewhere,
far away, with my brothers

03:02.316 --> 03:04.249
And then...
I'll be on to the next.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.751
Where will you go?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.886
I was thinking morocco.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.321
You don't think you'd
stand out in morocco?

03:09.323 --> 03:10.856
Sweden then.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.858
Perhaps it's a land
you'll visit one day,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.594
Walking along a frozen river,

03:15.596 --> 03:17.896
A displaced prince
will appear in front of you.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.866
Well, I hope I never
see you again.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.735
Because you're safe, settled.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.837
Married with children
of your own.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.640
I hope the same for you.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.612
Francis, when you see mary...

03:33.614 --> 03:35.847
We ran into each other
at a chateau outside of...

03:35.849 --> 03:37.916
Traveled with each other
for a day,

03:37.918 --> 03:39.818
And that is all.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.721
I know you live your life
in service to her.
Mary is my friend.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.489
Nothing we did will change that.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.860
(bird cawing)

03:48.862 --> 03:50.629
(passionate moaning, panting)

04:01.007 --> 04:02.708
That was lovely.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.343
(panting)

04:04.345 --> 04:06.945
I think you should go now.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.616
Don't do this to yourself.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.287
I won't leave you.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.289
I need to know
you're all right.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.758
If it comforts you.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.470
Why do you do it?
Sometimes, when one
is given a gift

04:31.472 --> 04:33.805
And worries they've lost it,

04:33.807 --> 04:35.841
They must return
to its source--

04:35.843 --> 04:37.976
The giver itself.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.012
And for me...

04:40.980 --> 04:43.548
...That is death.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.585
Or as near death as
I dare to venture.

04:55.595 --> 04:59.031
(rope creaking,
nostradamus choking)

05:04.070 --> 05:06.972
(gasping, coughing)

05:06.974 --> 05:09.408
Stop it, please!

05:13.579 --> 05:16.415
The vision-- I wasn't done.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.483
You saw something?

05:18.485 --> 05:22.487
This changes everything.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.490
I will die for this.

05:25.492 --> 05:29.494
The queen will kill me herself.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.432
(indistinct chatter)

05:33.434 --> 05:35.434
What a show.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.502
She's going out in style.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.376
(sighs)
must I do everything?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.511
Shall I catch my head
in my own hands, too?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.947
When can we talk about my tomb?

05:48.949 --> 05:52.050
A florentine sculptor?
20 tons of marble?

05:52.052 --> 05:55.954
I can't afford it.
After the 100 musicians,

05:55.956 --> 05:58.023
The dozen ships made
of silver and gold...
Symbolic of my journey

05:58.025 --> 05:59.524
To heaven.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.593
I'm not asking for a fleet.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.428
You're not headed
for heaven either.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.030
You're dragging
this out.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.898
You have to wait
for final word

06:06.900 --> 06:08.967
On bash's legitimization anyway.

06:08.969 --> 06:13.705
Why kill me if the line of
succession reverts to my sons?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.707
You're a treasonous adulterer.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.043
Then I'll continue
with the seating chart.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.047
Mary, the feast
will be held there.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.549
Choose your place of honor.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.486
You are going to die.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.821
What they write about
your execution won't matter.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.823
It will to my children.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.825
(groans)
50 musicians.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.961
I'll reduce the gold inlay
on my tomb.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.397
(trumpeting outside)

06:38.399 --> 06:40.065
What is that?

06:40.067 --> 06:43.068
There's a royal visitor.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.559
French court has gone to hell.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.997
(exhales)
but I'm here now, dear.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.133
Mother.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.935
So I sent you here
to wed a king

07:16.937 --> 07:19.070
And find you engaged
to a bastard.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.939
My darling,
your engagement

07:20.941 --> 07:23.041
To francis was a careful
negotiation set in place

07:23.043 --> 07:24.509
When you were six.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.077
And now you tell me

07:26.079 --> 07:29.080
That you threw it all away
because of a prophecy.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.149
One I believe, mother.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.453
I did this and bash went along
with it to save francis's life.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.789
From a fate
a magician predicted.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.025
Mother, it's all very...
Complicated.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.794
And we haven't been together
in so long.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.729
I came to the convent
for your 11th birthday.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.698
Half the ship's crew
died along the way,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.099
But I was there.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.801
Gift in hand.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.171
I only meant to say that...
I've missed you.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.874
And I wanted to talk to you
about this, about francis,

07:55.876 --> 07:59.077
About bash,
a-about everything.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.813
Please don't make light
of nostradamus's warning

08:01.815 --> 08:03.148
Or my choice.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.150
I make light of nothing
concerning you

08:05.152 --> 08:07.152
Or our country's future.
Perhaps if you met bash.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.689
He's-he's kind
and-and selfless and brave.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.123
Do you love him?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.726
I'm beginning to.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.128
It all happened so fast.
Good.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.097
Perhaps there's still time
for you to see things

08:19.099 --> 08:20.632
With a clear mind.

08:20.634 --> 08:25.537
(bell tolling in distance)

08:25.539 --> 08:27.172
I've wanted to be
with you as well,

08:27.174 --> 08:28.640
But there is
trouble at home.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.142
Scotland is in peril.
The english,
I know.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.210
It's worse.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.112
Our country is on
the knife's edge

08:34.114 --> 08:36.047
Of falling into protestantism.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.216
And we are catholic rulers.

08:38.218 --> 08:43.255
You need France, a catholic
country, at your side now.

08:43.257 --> 08:44.923
Marry its next king,

08:44.925 --> 08:46.825
And the protestants will
scurry into the darkness.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.160
Marry francis.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.664
Not some bastard who
someday might be king.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.299
His name is sebastian.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.301
Has the same ring to it.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.238
Well, I have no choice

09:00.240 --> 09:01.940
But to support you,

09:01.942 --> 09:04.109
As I rule scotland
but you are

09:04.111 --> 09:06.144
Actually its queen.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.013
And my daughter.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.148
So headstrong.
(sighs)

09:10.150 --> 09:12.984
So loving.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.820
So you'll be patient?

09:15.822 --> 09:18.890
Yes.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.294
Mary.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.296
Are you all right?

09:24.298 --> 09:25.697
Is all well with your mother?

09:25.699 --> 09:28.099
Yes. She's just as
I remember her,

09:28.101 --> 09:30.268
In ways that I often thought
I had imagined.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.304
I used to love the smell
of her perfume,

09:32.306 --> 09:35.640
The-the tenor of her
voice... Even now,

09:35.642 --> 09:37.275
When she lied to me.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.044
She doesn't want us
getting married.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.046
She will stop it.
We have to elope.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.214
Today. Now.

09:48.721 --> 09:51.156
Bash:
<i>There's a church just east of</i>
<i>the old village, by the quarry.</i>

09:51.158 --> 09:53.158
I wish that I could come
with you.
Let me get it

09:53.160 --> 09:55.193
All arranged.
It might take a few hours,

09:55.195 --> 09:57.696
And if we're both missing,
people will notice.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.899
If I'm not back by midday,
we have our priest.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.869
Get on a horse and meet me
at the church before sunset.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.778
Don't plan on sleeping
this night, wife.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.382
(chuckles)

10:17.384 --> 10:19.684
Marie:
<i>At least you're moving about</i>

10:19.686 --> 10:21.319
Freely now.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.289
Guarded, but
with the mobility

10:24.291 --> 10:26.291
Required to plan my death.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.727
How was
the dungeon?

10:28.729 --> 10:30.362
Were there fleas?

10:30.364 --> 10:33.298
Were you paraded
through the town, mocked?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.900
Hmm. I was in the tower.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.737
I realize you're not happy with
the turn events have taken,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.973
But must you paint
a bleaker picture of my fall?

10:43.242 --> 10:45.010
I trusted you
with mary's life.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.244
Not just her survival,

10:46.246 --> 10:48.013
Though I hear you
threatened that, too.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.281
I gave up every moment of being
a mother to my own child,

10:50.283 --> 10:52.017
Based on your word

10:52.019 --> 10:54.319
That you would raise her
to be francis's wife.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.288
What did you think,
when you traded a child

10:57.290 --> 10:59.090
For the protection of France?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.126
That we would put her welfare
above ours?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.928
Lord knows you didn't.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.364
You gave her away
to secure your rule.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.166
I had an infant,

11:08.168 --> 11:11.436
A girl, not even a week old
when my husband died,

11:11.438 --> 11:13.438
And she was crowned queen.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.273
I met unexpected horrors
and tragedy

11:15.275 --> 11:16.775
And I faced them with courage.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.243
You...

11:19.712 --> 11:22.814
One charlatan scared you
by whispering in your ear

11:22.816 --> 11:24.315
About your son's death--

11:24.317 --> 11:26.184
A future no one could know--

11:26.186 --> 11:28.353
And you changed
the course of nations.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.356
Nostradamus's accuracy
is an inarguable feat.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.158
Here's a feat:

11:33.160 --> 11:35.393
Women like you and me,
surviving in this age.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.828
(wry laugh)

11:36.830 --> 11:39.330
I have sold my soul,
and my child,

11:39.332 --> 11:41.833
To protect myself
and my nation.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.135
Mary may be
scotland's queen

11:44.137 --> 11:46.304
But I am its king.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.706
Has scotland noticed
that its king

11:47.708 --> 11:50.842
Has rather overexposed breasts?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.144
It is beginning to.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.846
Ah.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.482
Now that mary's come of age,
they look beyond me,

11:57.484 --> 12:02.287
They want her, and I want
her protected by France.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.089
France's true king.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.758
Not some bastard they can
knock off the throne,

12:06.760 --> 12:09.094
Whose life only took form

12:09.096 --> 12:11.162
Because you couldn't keep your
husband's interest in bed.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.064
I am defeated.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.334
If you want to fix this,
do it yourself.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.076
Ah, here it is.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.746
My mother had it packed
deep in one of my trunks.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.415
Well, it's beautiful,
but will it be warm enough?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.317
This isn't for your journey
to the chapel.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.952
It's for you to cover your face

12:33.954 --> 12:36.755
As you and bash stand before god
and profess your love.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.493
Is that lola?

12:44.864 --> 12:45.964
Why is she with francis?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.500
Lola:
Mary.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.535
Kenna, greer.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.175
Your grace.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.476
You're back.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.278
Both of you.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.213
Uh, your carriage,

13:02.215 --> 13:03.782
Why didn't they announce
your arrival at the gate?

13:03.784 --> 13:06.117
We ran into each other
at a chateau near angers.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.786
You came back together?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.053
We rode.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.889
There were floods.
The carriage I leased

13:10.891 --> 13:13.291
Was swept away in the night.
Can you imagine?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.459
Kenna:
Along the river.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.528
You were at
the chateau de martin?

13:16.530 --> 13:19.264
You know it? Yes.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.400
â™ª dirty your hands

13:22.402 --> 13:24.969
â™ª tearing my heart
I'll get settled then.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.538
â™ª into pieces
so happy to be back.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.540
Yes, we're happy
to have you back.

13:28.542 --> 13:32.377
â™ª if this is the end

13:32.379 --> 13:36.281
â™ª then we whisper the wind
and release it... â™ª

13:36.283 --> 13:38.249
You heard about your mother.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.385
I'm so sorry.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.554
I'm back to plead with my father
for her life.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.556
I'll be gone from court
once I have my answer

13:44.558 --> 13:46.157
And the matter is settled,

13:46.159 --> 13:48.459
And you and I will never
see each other again.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.230
I don't mean that
to sound cruel or angry.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.932
I understand.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.601
You don't want to be seen
as someone lying in wait

13:56.603 --> 13:58.403
To reclaim your throne.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.472
Or anything else that now
belongs to my brother.

14:07.847 --> 14:12.183
They brought this back,
after clarissa's death.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.853
I thought you might want
to have it,

14:14.855 --> 14:17.155
As you were more parent to her
than I.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.993
They buried her in
an unmarked grave

14:21.995 --> 14:23.261
Near the lake,

14:23.263 --> 14:25.930
Where the north road ends.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.433
I asked them to mark
it with a cross,

14:28.435 --> 14:31.302
But it's unhallowed ground.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.007
What will become of her soul,

14:36.009 --> 14:37.508
I wonder?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.278
Did she know any happiness
in her miserable life?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.913
When she was young.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.249
The villagers who raised her
for a time were kind.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.351
How do you know that?
She spoke of them.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.552
Of their games.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.588
A song they'd sing
to calm her to sleep.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.958
Sometimes, I'd hear her sing it
softly, to herself.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.393
How lonely.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.295
And haunting.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.598
Yes.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.503
I'm going to tell you something
that might enrage you.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.307
Since mary's arrival, I've had
visions of francis's death.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.643
<i>Violent images.</i>

15:11.645 --> 15:14.445
They vary, but they were always
<i>tied to mary.</i>

15:14.447 --> 15:17.315
But they stopped completely
when clarissa died.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.617
I have beckoned them,
every way I know how,

15:19.619 --> 15:20.652
Because I had to be sure.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.353
Sure of what?

15:22.355 --> 15:25.390
That francis might live
with mary.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.659
How can <i>that</i> be possible?

15:27.661 --> 15:30.061
I warned you that francis,
your firstborn,

15:30.063 --> 15:32.297
Would die because of mary...

15:32.299 --> 15:34.299
You were very clear.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.669
...Before either of us knew
clarissa was your firstborn.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.974
The blood that has been spilled,

15:42.976 --> 15:44.509
<i>My</i> blood yet,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.544
Was because of what you foresaw.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.180
It's not a science,
it's a gift.

15:49.182 --> 15:53.518
Sometimes I hear voices,
other times it's a feeling,

15:53.520 --> 15:56.521
A certainty as solid as stone.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.523
And this new feeling?

15:58.525 --> 15:59.724
It came to me today.

15:59.726 --> 16:03.561
I saw their life together,
and it is happy.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.597
After dinner, and your usual
game of catch with anne,

16:06.599 --> 16:08.599
James is going to want
your attention, too,
with his reading.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.269
I'll have him work on it.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.603
You promise.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.073
Promise me, I mean it.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.543
They have children,
as he is alive.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.245
(mutters)

16:21.247 --> 16:22.613
Children?

16:22.615 --> 16:26.317
You see them years
beyond their union?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.618
Yes.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.088
Use this to save yourself.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.622
Tell henry you've had
a change of heart.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.725
That you won't stand in the way
of their union.

16:33.727 --> 16:38.262
This has gone so far beyond me
standing in the way of anything.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.366
I am convicted of adultery!

16:41.368 --> 16:43.334
Of treason!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.536
Mary is with sebastian.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.771
And my son francis...

16:46.773 --> 16:48.606
Has returned to court.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.042
(gasps)

16:54.213 --> 16:59.784
You are brave
to come to me with this.

16:59.786 --> 17:03.588
Because if I can't convince mary
to wed francis,

17:03.590 --> 17:08.059
If I can't undo your mistakes,
I will lose my head.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.696
But not before I watch
you burned to death.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.432
I promise you that.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.710
Catherine:
Francis!

17:25.712 --> 17:26.744
Mother.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.613
Ah, it's true!

17:28.615 --> 17:31.049
You're back!

17:31.051 --> 17:32.750
Oh, thank god.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.218
They tell me father's
out hunting pheasant

17:34.220 --> 17:35.486
Beyond the south keep.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.621
I'm going to find him,

17:36.623 --> 17:38.122
Get him to see reason,

17:38.124 --> 17:40.058
And I'll get you away from here.
No, no, francis.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.527
There's something
else that you must do.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.133
Everything I did, I did for you.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.601
You needn't remind me.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.603
I need you to forget all of it.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.771
What?
Everything I warned you of.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.406
The warnings I gave mary.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.341
Go to her,
tell her that I believe

17:57.343 --> 17:59.777
The two of you can be wed.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.112
I don't understand.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.648
Your fate has changed.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.682
Oh, what does it matter?

18:04.684 --> 18:05.683
You never believed

18:05.685 --> 18:06.751
That nostradamus had the power

18:06.753 --> 18:08.519
To see the future anyway.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.355
What matters is
that you love mary.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.490
I did love mary.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.492
You destroyed that.
Nonsense.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.360
She's with bash now,
but she loves you.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.396
You don't know that.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.164
I don't know that.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.400
What matters is
what you want.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.835
Is it mary?

18:23.837 --> 18:26.804
Is it to save my life?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.539
Is it the throne of France?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.441
Is it the safety
of your brothers?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.577
Say it, say it!

18:32.579 --> 18:33.744
I know it's true!
Yes.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.279
Yes, of course,
I want all those things.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.516
Then tell mary I will cause
her no harm ever.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.518
And that she will
cause you no harm

18:40.520 --> 18:41.619
By loving you.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.187
By marrying you.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.189
Go to her.
Marie:
But do it quickly.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.692
I see your son's return
has restored your will to live.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.760
It's because he will live.

18:49.762 --> 18:50.862
Your magic has changed.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.897
How silly and marvelous.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.565
You don't believe
in prophecies, do you?

18:54.567 --> 18:55.766
No, I never did.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.834
You're...

18:56.836 --> 18:58.136
Marie de guise.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.237
Your future mother-in-law,

18:59.239 --> 19:00.538
If you so desire.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.306
If you get on your horse,
and stop mary

19:02.308 --> 19:03.808
From making the biggest mistake
of her life.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.276
Where is she?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.178
Heading for a church
near a quarry.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.813
The servants talked
about a village

19:08.815 --> 19:10.815
Nearly destroyed by the plague.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.817
Yes, I bribed them.
He may as well know

19:12.819 --> 19:14.719
Who I am, if we're to be kin.

19:14.721 --> 19:15.853
I know the place.
Then hurry.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.390
His hands on everything
you want.

19:22.794 --> 19:25.630
(horse splutters)

19:25.632 --> 19:27.431
(horse neighs)

19:29.668 --> 19:31.335
Your majesty,
a messenger has arrived.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.571
He said there's news regarding
the line of succession.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.173
About sebastian?

19:35.175 --> 19:36.874
He awaits you
in your throne room.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.310
Brother?

19:39.312 --> 19:40.578
Francis.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.247
I'm going
to tell you something.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.817
And it will hurt.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.920
I know you're here
to elope with mary.

19:48.922 --> 19:50.321
You don't need to.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.689
All that nonsense
about the prophecy,

19:51.691 --> 19:52.690
It's gone now.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.858
My mother's let it go

19:53.860 --> 19:55.326
For reasons she can explain.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.827
I'm going to tell mary.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.529
She'll talk to my mother,
to nostradamus.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.564
She'll be convinced.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.831
She won't trust catherine.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.433
I don't trust catherine.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.435
You don't want things
to change, to revert.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.904
You're going to play
on mary's fear.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.373
She came to me willingly.
And she will stay with me.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.975
She turned to you
because she had to.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.277
It was only a marriage
of convenience.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.979
And what was yours?
It went beyond that.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.847
You know it.
And now you know

20:16.849 --> 20:18.616
Ours did, too.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.618
You're lying.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.253
You entitled son of a bitch.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.921
You.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.289
You're nothing.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.925
(grunts)

20:27.927 --> 20:30.695
(yells)

20:30.697 --> 20:32.430
(both grunting)

20:40.939 --> 20:42.473
(horse neighing)

20:42.475 --> 20:43.608
Stop!

20:43.610 --> 20:45.476
Francis! Bash! Stop!

20:45.478 --> 20:46.978
Stop! Please, stop!

20:52.417 --> 20:53.651
You don't have
to marry him!

20:53.653 --> 20:54.919
It's all over!

20:54.921 --> 20:56.587
My mother, nostradamus,

20:56.589 --> 20:57.888
They say we can be wed.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.991
What do you mean?

20:59.993 --> 21:01.659
There is no prophecy
keeping us apart.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.727
Please, listen...

21:02.729 --> 21:04.495
Does it matter?

21:04.497 --> 21:06.831
Mary, nothing
needs to change.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.532
We can still be wed.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.968
What do you mean, no prophecy?

21:10.970 --> 21:12.837
Even nostradamus
will tell you.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.973
Your fate is your own when
it comes to who will you marry.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.575
(francis panting)

21:17.577 --> 21:19.877
Him or me.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.989
(sighs)

21:31.991 --> 21:34.025
I knew he would get
to you in time.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.894
Did your seer tell you that,
too? Is this a game to you?

21:36.896 --> 21:39.997
Nostradamus told me the
prophecy was fulfilled.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.732
With clarissa's death.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.635
How can I believe you
when you have so much to lose?

21:53.779 --> 21:55.579
(gasping)

21:56.882 --> 22:00.584
(gasps)
oh, god, what are you doing?

22:01.920 --> 22:05.456
Do nothing, and I will die.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.991
Watch me,
if that's what it takes

22:06.993 --> 22:08.592
To convince you
I'm not putting

22:08.594 --> 22:10.494
My life ahead of my son's.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.363
I never have.
Stop this.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.832
I'll be beheaded if you don't
choose francis anyway.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.500
I'd rather die today

22:16.502 --> 22:19.503
To show you that I mean
every word that I say.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.905
Is this some kind of trick?

22:20.907 --> 22:24.008
Test me.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.043
(panting)

22:27.079 --> 22:28.612
(gasps)

22:28.614 --> 22:31.349
Ask nostradamus
to explain

22:31.351 --> 22:33.984
How the future
he sees for you and francis

22:33.986 --> 22:35.686
Has altered
since clarissa's death.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.955
(sighs)

22:37.957 --> 22:40.124
Oh, yes. Be sure.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.993
Be very sure.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.896
I would want
every certainty, too.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.532
(panting)

22:48.534 --> 22:50.568
(inhales sharply)

22:50.570 --> 22:53.771
(panting)

22:54.973 --> 22:57.108
I'm not sure.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.009
I'm not sure
about anything.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.745
I believe you, but...

23:00.747 --> 23:02.012
You don't know what you want.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.548
I love them.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.818
I love them both.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.453
(door opens)

23:09.455 --> 23:11.956
Begging your pardon,
your majesties,

23:11.958 --> 23:13.824
But the king demands
your presence.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.101
A messenger has arrived
with news

23:24.103 --> 23:26.470
About the line of
succession of England.

23:26.472 --> 23:31.142
Their queen... Is dead.

23:31.144 --> 23:33.911
(courtiers murmuring)

23:38.750 --> 23:40.985
And she has named me
her successor?

23:40.987 --> 23:43.120
After all her deliberations,
they say she died

23:43.122 --> 23:45.990
Suddenly...
In the night.

23:45.992 --> 23:49.660
But England is yours
by bloodline, by right.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.162
You must claim
it immediately,

23:51.164 --> 23:54.965
Or your cousin elizabeth
will seize it from your grasp.

23:54.967 --> 23:58.169
You risk everything
if you don't act now.

23:58.171 --> 24:00.538
If you want the vatican's
righteous support

24:00.540 --> 24:02.840
For anything you do,
for the rest of your life,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.141
You will claim England now.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.143
If you want
France as an ally,

24:06.145 --> 24:08.846
You will claim England now.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.848
If you want to take
England, you will need

24:10.850 --> 24:12.783
The next king of France
by your side.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.718
And you will wed

24:14.720 --> 24:16.821
One of my sons tonight.

24:19.524 --> 24:22.626
I will take my life
in my own hands.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.663
And I will not be
bullied by you.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.139
Lady kenna requests a
visit, your majesty.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.107
No.

24:37.109 --> 24:40.177
She requests that I inform you
that she's naked under her robe.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.179
(sighs)

24:42.181 --> 24:43.881
Send her in.

24:51.623 --> 24:54.058
It's nice to see
you're still on your feet.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.093
What does that mean?
I watched you

24:56.095 --> 24:57.561
Take it lying down
for weeks now,

24:57.563 --> 24:58.996
From all the women
in your life.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.731
You don't like
being bossed around

25:00.733 --> 25:02.066
By a girl, do you?

25:02.068 --> 25:04.635
Is this meant to arouse?

25:04.637 --> 25:09.206
I was wrong to blame
and demand things of you.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.742
I should have blamed
you, absolutely.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.178
I also should have offered
you more of what you'd like

25:14.180 --> 25:15.813
For what I'd like.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.548
You're offering me sex
for a husband?

25:17.550 --> 25:18.916
I could get sex anywhere.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.117
Not from me.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.919
How little it
would take for you

25:21.921 --> 25:24.154
To write me an introduction
or two.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.123
You're not exactly
inspiring me to send you away.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.093
What if I offered to
stay here at the castle,

25:29.095 --> 25:30.694
Even if I were married,

25:30.696 --> 25:33.230
At your beck
and call?

25:33.232 --> 25:34.698
You'd have diane.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.233
I'd have my station,

25:36.235 --> 25:38.002
My position.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.004
Find me a rich noble

25:40.006 --> 25:42.006
Who treats me right,

25:42.008 --> 25:43.574
And I'll treat you right,
as well.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.183
You've learned
many skills at court.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.319
Teach me more.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.793
One suitor a week
until I choose.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.929
Agreed?

26:04.931 --> 26:07.765
Agreed.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.336
No. No more.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.171
I'm in charge now.

26:17.809 --> 26:20.277
(knocking on door)

26:22.013 --> 26:24.181
Have you found my mother?

26:24.183 --> 26:25.816
I need her now, more than ever.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.117
They said she's with the king.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.619
Trying to wring more
out of henry

26:28.621 --> 26:30.187
Before I'm married
to anyone, no doubt.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.656
But who will you marry?
Have you spoken with bash?

26:32.658 --> 26:34.992
No.
Francis?

26:34.994 --> 26:37.227
(knocking on door)

26:39.064 --> 26:40.264
Catherine:
Could we have a moment?

26:44.836 --> 26:47.004
(catherine sighs)

26:47.006 --> 26:48.305
What an eventful day.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.074
Francis's return,

26:50.076 --> 26:51.809
News of

26:51.811 --> 26:54.845
The queen's death... And this.

26:54.847 --> 26:58.749
News from the vatican.

26:58.751 --> 27:02.319
If this letter confirms
sebastian's legitimization,

27:02.321 --> 27:04.321
It should take away
any reservations

27:04.323 --> 27:07.625
You have about a bastard
at your side instead of a king,

27:07.627 --> 27:10.194
As bash will be
king one day.

27:10.196 --> 27:14.732
If it denies his legitimization,

27:14.734 --> 27:18.302
How could bash blame you
for returning to francis?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.074
(gasps)

27:24.076 --> 27:25.843
I know you think
you love them both.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.078
While that may be true,

27:28.080 --> 27:31.849
I argue that you love one more.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.254
I am afraid.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.757
Open it.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.761
(sighs)

27:45.397 --> 27:49.933
Now you're free

27:49.935 --> 27:52.369
To go to the man you love.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.872
(door opens)

28:07.352 --> 28:09.753
I can't marry you.

28:09.755 --> 28:12.089
Yes, you can.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.291
Don't let your mother
put ideas in your head

28:14.293 --> 28:18.062
About my ability to protect you,
because I will be king.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.296
We can force the pope's hand.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.131
I know that.
With me,

28:21.133 --> 28:22.900
You are free and wild.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.368
You can be
who you are,

28:24.370 --> 28:26.704
And I will always put you first.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.872
Please, don't.

28:30.075 --> 28:32.176
Say that you love me.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.213
Say it to me once,
because I know that you do.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.749
I love you, I do.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.118
Say it.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.887
Say the rest.
I need to hear it.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.025
I love francis more.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.734
(door creaks open, then shuts)

29:19.457 --> 29:21.959
(mary sniffles)

29:25.363 --> 29:26.764
What's this?

29:26.766 --> 29:29.166
Open it.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.470
It's blank.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.372
(laughs)
it's nothing.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.008
She let me decide.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.877
It's odd, isn't it?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.345
That your mother
was the one

29:41.347 --> 29:43.347
To show me what was
truly in my heart.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.349
You.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.353
It's you.
It's always been you.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.958
Does this mean you'll marry me?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.461
Yes.

30:12.443 --> 30:16.313
We must protect
sebastian.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.449
There are those
who will punish him

30:19.451 --> 30:21.919
For reaching
for the throne.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.354
Of course.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.991
I'll make sure of it.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.981
I am sorry for the
way things have gone.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.984
But the outcome is this.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.586
You need to
leave here

30:55.588 --> 30:57.321
And never come back.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.189
You've reached
for the crown,

30:59.191 --> 31:01.158
And you failed to get it.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.893
You'll be seen
by many as a threat.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.262
The crown was never in my grasp,

31:05.264 --> 31:09.499
But I had mary,
and it galls you.

31:09.501 --> 31:14.071
I was going
to disappear in exile.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.907
That's your goal now,
if you want to survive.

31:16.909 --> 31:18.508
My guards will take you
south of here

31:18.510 --> 31:20.477
To a ship set
for the southern coast of Spain,

31:20.479 --> 31:22.112
And from there,
you should keep going.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.514
You needed to vanish

31:24.516 --> 31:26.550
Because you would have been
a displaced king.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.553
But I'm just a bastard.
In time,

31:29.555 --> 31:32.456
A very short time,
if you'd accepted my presence,

31:32.458 --> 31:35.125
The nobles would, too,
and I'd be safe.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.594
If you were so inclined.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.568
I'm not so inclined.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.304
Well, there it is...

31:47.306 --> 31:50.107
The truth between us
at last.

31:50.109 --> 31:53.443
Make sure what's between us,
brother, is distance.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.613
If you want to survive.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.150
(door shuts)

32:05.657 --> 32:06.990
Marie: <i>So, we'll do</i>
<i>another ceremony for you</i>

32:06.992 --> 32:09.526
At notre dame,
so that all of France

32:09.528 --> 32:11.528
Can celebrate your marriage.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.397
And what of queen catherine?

32:13.399 --> 32:14.998
She's been pardoned
for her adultery?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.533
(chuckling):
Yes.

32:16.535 --> 32:20.637
It was all to legitimize bash.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.408
Now henry looks
benevolent, forgiving.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.644
Your father gave me these.

32:29.314 --> 32:32.015
Make some heirs
quick as you can.

32:32.017 --> 32:35.585
It's a queen's sons
that give her power after all,

32:35.587 --> 32:37.087
Though we've handled

32:37.089 --> 32:39.122
The misfortune
of your sex, haven't we?

32:40.525 --> 32:42.426
Brave girls are we.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.332
Greer said you were upset.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.734
I came to your room last night
to cheer you with hot cocoa,

32:50.736 --> 32:53.170
But your servant said
you were meeting with the king.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.605
So?
It was very late.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.607
If you're back with him,
I think it's a mistake.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.509
I know the chÃ¢teau
you claim to stay at in angers

32:59.511 --> 33:01.178
Where you ran into francis.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.680
It burned down last year.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.115
I don't know
what happened

33:05.117 --> 33:07.184
Between the two of you,
but I can guess,

33:07.186 --> 33:10.387
So please don't counsel me
on mistakes.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.659
Come along, girls,
be of service to your queen.

33:18.763 --> 33:21.665
Girl:
â™ª oh, my sweetest child

33:21.667 --> 33:25.502
â™ª god's smile
behind your eyes â™ª

33:25.504 --> 33:27.304
â™ª in his hand, in our arms

33:27.306 --> 33:30.741
â™ª you will find
no harm. â™ª

33:30.743 --> 33:33.010
Who are you?
Why are you singing that song?

33:34.445 --> 33:35.746
I was told to
sing it near you.

33:35.748 --> 33:37.381
By who?

33:37.383 --> 33:40.117
I was paid by another
who was paid by a girl--

33:40.119 --> 33:41.118
I don't know who.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.653
She's dead.

33:43.655 --> 33:44.588
That girl is dead.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.656
It's impossible.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.460
(bell tolls)

33:50.462 --> 33:52.629
(choir singing)

33:54.632 --> 33:57.734
The messenger
who delivered the news

33:57.736 --> 34:00.637
Of the english queen's death
isn't here.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.707
I suppose he knew
he'd served his purpose

34:03.709 --> 34:06.410
And that your invitation
was a mere courtesy,

34:06.412 --> 34:09.413
A thanks for giving us both
what we want.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.382
You bribed him
to bear false news.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.717
To get the job done,

34:13.719 --> 34:16.553
As you failed
in that task completely.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.622
You can thank me later.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.792
(door opens)

34:28.066 --> 34:30.634
â™ª the power of love

34:30.636 --> 34:34.738
â™ª a force from above

34:34.740 --> 34:39.309
â™ª cleaning my soul

34:40.278 --> 34:43.580
â™ª flame on, burn desire

34:43.582 --> 34:46.616
â™ª love with tongues of fire

34:46.618 --> 34:49.453
â™ª purge the soul

34:49.455 --> 34:54.424
â™ª make love your goal

35:12.677 --> 35:16.746
â™ª I...

35:18.683 --> 35:22.519
â™ª hmm...

35:23.521 --> 35:27.524
â™ª the power of love

35:27.526 --> 35:31.595
â™ª a skyscraping dove...

35:34.132 --> 35:36.566
â™ª flame on, burn desire

35:36.568 --> 35:39.803
â™ª love with tongues of fire...

35:59.724 --> 36:02.225
Clarissa.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.894
She's alive.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.737
â™ª I'll be kind
if you'll be faithful â™ª

36:13.739 --> 36:16.540
â™ª you be sweet
and I'll be grateful â™ª

36:16.542 --> 36:18.375
(guests cheering)
â™ª fortune teller
said I'd be free â™ª

36:18.377 --> 36:23.346
â™ª and that's the day
you came to me â™ª

36:23.348 --> 36:25.649
â™ª mmm, mmm

36:25.651 --> 36:28.318
â™ª came to me

36:28.320 --> 36:31.955
â™ª mmm, mmm

36:31.957 --> 36:34.891
â™ª da-da-de-dah-dah

36:34.893 --> 36:36.760
â™ª da-dum-da-da-dum

36:36.762 --> 36:39.663
â™ª come to me,
my sweetest friend â™ª

36:39.665 --> 36:42.399
â™ª can you feel my heart again?

36:42.401 --> 36:44.601
â™ª I'll take you back
where you belong â™ª

36:44.603 --> 36:47.938
â™ª and this will be
our favorite song â™ª

36:47.940 --> 36:50.707
â™ª come to me with secrets bare

36:50.709 --> 36:52.943
â™ª I'll love you more,
so don't be scared â™ª

36:52.945 --> 36:55.212
â™ª and when we're old
and near the end â™ª

36:55.214 --> 36:58.415
â™ª we'll go home
and start again â™ª

36:58.417 --> 37:03.987
â™ª mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

37:03.989 --> 37:07.757
â™ª mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm, mmm. â™ª

37:09.427 --> 37:11.494
You missed the wedding.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.363
I thought it best.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.664
I've been thinking
about what's best

37:14.666 --> 37:15.932
For all of us as well.
I'm leaving.

37:15.934 --> 37:16.933
You needn't worry.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.301
And yet I do.

37:18.303 --> 37:21.771
So you won't be
leaving us just yet.

37:23.841 --> 37:26.509
I have some news to share.

37:26.511 --> 37:29.813
Turns out the english queen
isn't dead after all.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.781
The english queen is alive?

37:31.783 --> 37:35.318
But I would keep
the news to yourself.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.454
You did this.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.955
To see me married.

37:38.957 --> 37:42.459
The messenger's news was flawed.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.627
No one could blame
that on me.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.328
Or you.

37:45.330 --> 37:48.732
Everyone needs a little
push on occasion.

37:48.734 --> 37:49.966
Even queens.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.901
Even France.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.837
All happiness comes
with a price.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.006
And you paid yours
with another's broken heart.

37:56.008 --> 37:57.007
Sebastian...

37:57.009 --> 37:58.408
Will survive.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.677
It's time for the consummation.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.347
A moment, please.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.551
Get out.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.953
Get out of my life.

38:09.955 --> 38:10.954
Get out of France.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.857
But you have everything
you ever wanted.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.725
And more power than you.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.761
I'm your mother.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.029
I am ruling scotland

38:19.031 --> 38:20.497
For you...

38:20.499 --> 38:21.498
Do that.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.866
And mind me, do it well.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.302
When I return to scotland,
to our home,

38:25.304 --> 38:27.404
It will either be
because you have failed,

38:27.406 --> 38:29.372
Or because you are dead.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.411
(indistinct chatter,
festive music playing)

38:42.086 --> 38:44.688
Mary: <i>After dinner,</i>
<i>your usual game of catch</i>

38:44.690 --> 38:46.089
With anne,
james is going

38:46.091 --> 38:48.091
To want your attention, too,
with his reading.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.660
I'll have him work on it.

38:50.662 --> 38:51.995
You promise?

38:51.997 --> 38:54.464
Promise me, I mean it.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.433
Promise me you'll try.

38:56.435 --> 39:00.070
One year of marriage,
it isn't enough.

39:00.072 --> 39:03.039
Fight, francis, please.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.675
I will give you children.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.744
Don't give up on our dreams.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.979
On the life we could have.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.817
Such a beautiful dream.

39:18.622 --> 39:19.923
(sighs)
no.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.625
No, francis,
don't leave me.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.596
(crying quietly)

39:29.967 --> 39:31.935
(crying)

39:38.609 --> 39:40.009
Catherine:
So many years before them.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.947
I know I threatened you.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.950
In truth, I'm so glad

39:46.952 --> 39:48.885
You had the courage to tell me

39:48.887 --> 39:50.120
How their fate had changed.

39:51.422 --> 39:53.089
Yes.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.657
They will be together.

39:54.659 --> 39:57.127
For many years.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.997
I do this not out of any
malice, as you are my son,

40:00.999 --> 40:02.966
But to ensure peace.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.135
So that should you return,

40:05.137 --> 40:06.970
You have seared into your memory

40:06.972 --> 40:09.739
What is yours
and what is not.

40:12.576 --> 40:15.412
â™ª my

40:15.414 --> 40:17.414
â™ª baby

40:21.051 --> 40:24.821
â™ª wide-eyed

40:24.823 --> 40:27.757
â™ª pretty

40:27.759 --> 40:30.960
â™ª you're a body

40:30.962 --> 40:33.430
â™ª I

40:33.432 --> 40:36.099
â™ª can hold

40:37.968 --> 40:39.836
â™ª I'm a good

40:39.838 --> 40:42.005
â™ª man

40:42.007 --> 40:43.072
â™ª too.

41:01.826 --> 41:04.093
You're not a very
trusting fellow, are you?

41:04.095 --> 41:06.729
I was a lot more trusting
before you took my weapons.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.565
You'll get those back
as soon as you leave us.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.233
They say you're
a threat to the realm.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.068
But your family
wants you safe.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.470
Alive.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.871
Yes.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.072
You're not thirsty?

41:16.074 --> 41:18.174
I have my own, thanks.

41:26.584 --> 41:28.818
(both yell)

41:31.222 --> 41:32.722
(grunts)

41:32.724 --> 41:33.723
Who paid you to kill me?

41:33.725 --> 41:36.726
The queen or my brother?
