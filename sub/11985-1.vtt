00:38.772 --> 00:42.231
My name is Tyler Austin,
And this is my dog...

00:43.076 --> 00:45.705
his name is... Dog

00:47.014 --> 00:48.949
I know that may seem like
a weird name, but...

00:49.049 --> 00:52.019
when I was little,
that's what I used to call him.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.719
So, my Mom and Dad
started calling him Dog too

00:55.389 --> 00:59.326
Dog's been around
since as long as I can remember.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.661
We love doing everything together.

01:02.029 --> 01:08.731
He also likes to play fetch,
chase cars, dig holes in the yard:

01:09.069 --> 01:11.265
oh, and he can do
some pretty cool tricks.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.201
I've heard that dogs
are man's best friend.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.577
Well, Dog is not
only my best friend.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.207
He is the greatest friend
I could ever have

01:20.447 --> 01:23.042
and nothing can in the world
ever replace him

01:23.517 --> 01:27.113
Happy Birthday
to the Greatest dog in the world.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.452
Aw, man.
I spelled Birthday wrong.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.127
Where were you on that one?

01:40.667 --> 01:43.193
All done... Time for bed.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.566
Twelve oh seven.

01:48.075 --> 01:51.045
You know what that means?
It's officially your Birthday

01:51.612 --> 01:53.911
Technically,
I can give you this now.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.924
Come on Dog.
Come on. Come on.

02:10.663 --> 02:14.567
Happy birthday Buddy.
I love you.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.663
Good morning, Dog

02:52.172 --> 02:53.470
I know what Want.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.033
You wanna go outside,
don't you boy?

02:57.210 --> 02:59.076
Well let's wake up mommy, huh?

02:59.479 --> 03:00.879
Hey, Mommy?

03:03.083 --> 03:05.484
- Good morning.
- Morning we have a visitor.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.355
Good morning Dog!

03:09.089 --> 03:10.557
- It's his Birthday Today.
- Oh, that's right.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.084
- It is his birthday today.
- Gimme kiss. Kiss.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.360
Go take Dog outside
sso he can do his business.

03:18.732 --> 03:22.225
- C'mon, I'm gonna get breakfast ready.
- Oh, it's early isn't it?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.968
It's early.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.638
Rise and shine honey.
Let's get that fixed this week.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.551
Yes, dear.

03:42.689 --> 03:46.922
Hey Tom can you put that stuff away,
please? Breakfast is almost ready.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.354
I'm on the verge of figuring
this thing out.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.564
Put it away.
Later, please.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.494
Oh. Hey, dog.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.035
Thanks, for the paper buddy.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.237
I'll tell you what sweetheart

04:00.474 --> 04:04.104
This one is gonna make you proud.
We're talking front page news.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.381
I'm proud
of my super genius husband

04:08.148 --> 04:11.118
- Is Tyler up yet?
- Newsflash. No.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.021
Dog, go get Tyler?

04:27.067 --> 04:29.127
Just give me a more minutes.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.966
Here, go play with squeaks.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.008
Ok. Ok, I'm up.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.281
Not at the table.

04:48.789 --> 04:53.955
Please let me eat with you. I love you all
so much, and besides, it's my birthday.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.086
Tom.

04:56.096 --> 05:00.591
- Oh, listen to your mother.
- Sorry, boy, down.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.929
What's going on with that
super-secret project of yours?

05:04.104 --> 05:06.039
- It's going pretty well.
- So, what's the surprise?

05:06.506 --> 05:09.806
- It's a surprise.
- Very cute.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.170
It's a video I made.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.878
Hey, I want to show it tonight.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.110
Can I borrow your projector?
I want it big.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.610
Course you can It's up in the attic.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.718
I have to get to the office.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.349
- You don't want to be late for work.
- I won't

05:22.689 --> 05:25.181
- And you don't be late for school.
- I won't.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.526
May I be excused?

05:29.095 --> 05:29.892
Yeah.

05:34.467 --> 05:38.427
- Can I have soda with my lunch?
- Sure you can.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.143
- Can I skip school today?
- Sure.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.243
Hey!

05:47.147 --> 05:49.582
Wise guy!
Go get ready for school!

05:50.050 --> 05:52.451
Fine, come on boy.
Come on.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.459
Tyler?

06:03.363 --> 06:07.357
I'm looking in the attic.
Trying to find your projector.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.229
- C'mon, we're gonna be late.
- Okay.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.444
Can you please be quiet?
I can't concentrate.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.551
Tyler!

06:38.198 --> 06:40.030
Here you are.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.963
C'mon dog. C'mon.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.228
C'mon.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.580
Tyler, c'mon.

07:01.288 --> 07:04.122
- Yes, Dad. Coming.
- There you are.

07:04.824 --> 07:05.883
Did you find it?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.187
- Yes.
- Great.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.897
- Did you put the ladder away?
- Yup.

07:10.463 --> 07:13.695
Way to go son, we're off.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.115
What'ya working on?

07:36.356 --> 07:38.791
- Can you keep a secret?
- No.

07:39.192 --> 07:44.221
It's a high end power source that
continually charges itself using kinetic energy

07:44.464 --> 07:45.488
Oh.

07:45.932 --> 07:49.767
Basically,
it's a recharging super battery.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.966
Oh, yeah. I... I knew that.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.269
Hey I've been working
on solar powered scissors.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.375
Oh? Yeah.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.871
So, instead of using your hands,
they'repowered by the sun?

08:02.115 --> 08:06.280
Well, uh, you still need your hands,
but... you know the motor helps you.

08:10.690 --> 08:11.385
Gotcha!

08:12.025 --> 08:13.550
- Hey, what's this?
- Hey!

08:14.294 --> 08:15.887
That is a robot.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.958
And, if my calculations are correct,

08:18.231 --> 08:21.759
once install the
self-charging super battery...

08:22.469 --> 08:23.334
like so.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.731
It should never run out of power.
Never?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.201
- In theory.
- Okay. Let's give it a go.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.477
Brandish your safety goggles.

08:43.722 --> 08:46.192
Oh... That's pretty bright.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.693
- That's pretty bright.
- Yes.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.225
Uh oh.

08:51.998 --> 08:52.966
Uh oh.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.564
Uh oh.

08:56.970 --> 08:57.665
Tom!

08:58.104 --> 09:00.164
- Is it supposed to do that?
- Okay. No!

09:01.041 --> 09:03.704
- Do something Tom!
- Would you give me my arm back.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.012
Think I'm gonna stick to my scissors.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.315
Jiminy jumper nuts.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.785
It'd work perfectly if it would stop
making stuff blow up.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.956
Mr. Willis. Get back to work.

09:28.768 --> 09:32.136
- Well, if it isn't...
- Tom Austin.

09:32.639 --> 09:38.044
- Yes, Tom, how are you?
- I'm, I'm great Mr. Willis,

09:38.111 --> 09:40.239
what brings you down here?

09:40.447 --> 09:45.681
Well, I'm just doing my monthly check in
to see what all my money's paying for.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.884
- Do you have anything good?
- Solar powered scissors.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.581
- What?
- Barry Melch.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.126
- Yes I know Belch.
- Melch.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.528
- What are you yapping about?
- I just wanted to show you these.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.355
Solar powered scissors.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.998
Solar powered scissors?

10:01.668 --> 10:08.040
Seriously Belch? It's called Epic Industries,
not as seen on TV Industries.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.611
- Well, I think if you'd...
- Get back to work. Go clean something...

10:11.945 --> 10:14.710
- that's what lab assistants do, isn't it?
- Yes sir.

10:15.548 --> 10:22.819
So, what do you have for me, Tom?
And don't tell me a solar powered spatula.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.358
Sir...

10:27.827 --> 10:29.090
Stop that.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.064
I told you to stop.
It's creepy.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.727
It's nothing like that sir.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.999
- Actually, what it is...
- He's working on a...

10:36.369 --> 10:38.964
- Self charging super battery.
- Belch!

10:40.807 --> 10:41.797
Is Belch, right?

10:42.075 --> 10:44.010
Self charging super battery?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.076
Actually, that is correct sir.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.478
Brilliant!
I knew you were a genius!

10:49.849 --> 10:54.344
Hiring you was the best decision
I made for this company.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.119
Now, is it done?

10:56.856 --> 11:01.157
Almost, there's just a few minor
over heating issues.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.687
Great!

11:03.129 --> 11:06.099
I have an investor from Japan
that's coming on Monday

11:06.332 --> 11:09.325
I'm gonna bring him by
for a demonstration.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.837
- Monday?
- Don't mess this up.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.769
I'll see you on Monday.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.013
Jiminy jumper nuts.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.377
Monday.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.048
Hey guys!

12:30.350 --> 12:32.046
Hey, Bill!
How you doing?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.314
Great.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.746
Hey, Tyler.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.556
Hey, Chloe.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.926
Getting ready for Dog's
big party tonight?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.586
Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.793
Hey, Tyler, you.
You wanna put this stuff away,

12:44.163 --> 12:45.290
- and let dog out
- Sure

12:45.732 --> 12:49.328
- So you guys stopping buy tonight?
- Of course we are. We're excited.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.195
You know who else is excited?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.399
- Who?
- Dog.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.640
He was really barking up
a storm earlier today.

12:56.909 --> 13:00.971
Really?
Strange. See you later.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.111
Ready for your party dog?

13:06.953 --> 13:07.943
Here boy.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.259
Dog, you ready
for your birthday part...

13:16.362 --> 13:17.523
Dog.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.433
Mom!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.139
- Hi
- Hey.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.838
Honey, it's awful.

13:36.949 --> 13:40.044
- How is he?
- He's up in the crawlspace,

13:41.087 --> 13:44.114
I tried to get him down, but,
it's like a hundred degrees in there.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.454
Okay. I'll get him.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.762
Tyler?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.568
Ah, buddy. Tyler.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.248
Tyler, I know it hurts, buddy.

14:15.988 --> 14:19.584
Come down stairs,
let's talk about it, okay?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.653
He came up here for squeeks

14:23.296 --> 14:25.162
I don't know what happened.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.631
I closed the steps, I promise.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.933
I know you did son.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.567
I... closed the steps.
I promise you.

14:36.843 --> 14:40.712
Tyler, you have to understand.
That this is just an accident.

14:43.983 --> 14:47.283
It's a horrible accident,
but it's not your fault.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.920
Can't leave dog here.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.187
I'm gonna take care of him
for you.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.126
Come here, Come on.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.030
Jeez.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.764
I am so sorry.

15:14.113 --> 15:15.638
Come on.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.710
Come on buddy.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.490
Come on big guy.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.674
Oh no! Sweetheart!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.948
- Sweetheart, I over-slept!
- What?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.212
I overslept!
My presentation's today.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.724
It's eight twenty seven?
What happened?

16:35.027 --> 16:38.191
Dog. Usually wakes us up!
Where's my...

16:38.965 --> 16:41.958
- I guess we need to start setting an alarm.
- Yeah.

16:45.771 --> 16:48.240
- Wish me luck.
- I love you honey, good luck.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.171
Hey, that's my purse.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.805
Thank you.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.114
You gonna be fine.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.747
Jiminy jumper nuts!

17:05.558 --> 17:07.151
So did ya get it working?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.027
Does it look like it's working,
Barry?

17:11.830 --> 17:13.196
It's still over-heating.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.460
- Donut?
- Thanks.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.768
- I didn't eat breakfast this morning.
- Oh, you shouldn't do that.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.973
It's the most important donut
of the day.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.605
Yeah, I didn't sleep much last night.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.373
Our family dog passed away
this weekend.

17:30.149 --> 17:33.085
That's so sad,
how long did you have it?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.719
- Eleven years.
- I had a pet goldfish once

17:37.156 --> 17:38.988
I accidentally flushed it down
the toilet.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.353
Luckily, my parents got a new one
so I wouldn't notice

17:43.696 --> 17:45.096
until right now.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.399
That's a strange story, Barry.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.001
I'm gonna get back to work now.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.805
- Thanks, for the donut.
- Hey, no problem.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.208
I just have to this

17:57.743 --> 18:01.475
- a couple more times before Mr. Willis...
- Tom!

18:04.016 --> 18:06.076
Mr. Willis you're early.

18:06.385 --> 18:13.519
Yes, I just couldn't wait to show off
my main man to my main man from Japan.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.857
This is Mr. Sato.

18:16.362 --> 18:17.352
Hello.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.423
Bon jour.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.024
So. Show us something.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.165
May I speak to you in private
for just one second?

18:29.642 --> 18:32.373
I'm not quite sure that it's ready.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.112
Not sure it's ready?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.273
Or it isn't ready?
Those are two very different things.

18:37.683 --> 18:38.742
- Very different.
- Right.

18:39.051 --> 18:44.046
I just think that maybe we could do
a few more tests before we demonstrate.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.955
Well, you had plenty of time
to run your tests over the weekend.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.920
- Jerome, how time is that?
- Three days.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.964
Three days, that's plenty of time.

18:52.164 --> 18:56.226
I understand Mr. Willis.
And this is not a valid excuse,

18:56.936 --> 19:01.636
However.
My family dog died on Friday.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.637
Alright, that's enough.
I understand.

19:05.211 --> 19:05.974
You do?

19:06.245 --> 19:11.445
Yes, I understand that you want me to look
like a fool in front of my business colleagues.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.514
And if there's one thing I hate:

19:13.753 --> 19:17.155
- it's being made to look like a fool.
- Hates it!

19:17.590 --> 19:20.150
Jerome, could you please go over
and stand with Belch?

19:20.559 --> 19:21.492
Yes sir.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.529
The last I want to do
is make you look like a fool.

19:24.730 --> 19:29.998
The last thing you want to do
is to not succeed.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.972
So, is ready?

19:34.006 --> 19:34.974
In theory

19:35.174 --> 19:39.703
Then in theory you still have a job.
Turn it on.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.103
Yes sir.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.842
Sorry Mr. Sato,
just a little pep talk.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.253
Okay, gentlemen:

19:49.555 --> 19:53.788
What you are about to see
is a power source that has the energy

19:53.993 --> 19:56.360
of twenty five car batteries

19:57.596 --> 20:02.125
With the ability to recharge it-self
just by the nature of it's own motion.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.961
Please: brand-your safety goggles.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.773
Here goes nothing.

20:10.309 --> 20:14.872
I give you the super battery.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.115
Is it a...

20:23.189 --> 20:24.555
Is it working?

20:24.990 --> 20:26.117
Yeah.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.157
Yeah, actually, I think it is.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.930
I'm gonna give it some more juice.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.870
Whoa! Tom! You're a genius.
Do you see that?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.069
Yes!

20:40.272 --> 20:41.331
Crank it up.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.232
Okay.

20:44.543 --> 20:48.412
- We're at thirty five percent, now.
- Okay, crank it up more.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.449
Mr. Willis I think we should play it
safe for now.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.843
Do I pay you to think?

20:54.520 --> 20:58.150
Epic Industries needs epic results.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.359
I'll save you Mr.Willis.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.162
Stop, drop and...

21:10.770 --> 21:12.329
Do something!

21:19.078 --> 21:20.603
Sorry, about that guys.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.175
I told you it could use
a few more tests

21:24.316 --> 21:26.342
But all things considering,
I think it was...

21:26.685 --> 21:28.017
pretty success...

21:29.989 --> 21:30.979
ful?

21:31.323 --> 21:33.519
That one epic hairdo.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.920
Get out! Get out!

21:38.631 --> 21:39.690
Am I fired?

21:40.032 --> 21:44.265
You are the most fired person
in the history of people get-ting fired!

21:44.637 --> 21:46.469
I never want to see you again.

21:46.872 --> 21:51.009
I'll just get my stuff.

21:51.010 --> 21:55.038
No! I will have it sent to you!
Now get out of here before I call security.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.638
Bye Tom.

21:58.784 --> 21:59.911
Bye, Barry

22:01.453 --> 22:06.255
- Mr. Sato, I am so sorry.
- If I could just get my phone.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.519
Get me security.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.771
Wanna take a look
at my solar powered scissors?

22:45.664 --> 22:46.757
Tom?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.869
- Oh... Hi!
- Hi! You're home kinda early?

22:52.571 --> 22:55.735
Yes... funny story.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.875
- Did you get fired?
- Yes! I got fired!

23:00.279 --> 23:02.976
And it doesn't sound as funny
when I say it out loud.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.043
I'm sorry babe. Are you okay?

23:05.551 --> 23:10.922
Yeah. I mean my boss was
being epic-ly ridiculous. So...

23:11.490 --> 23:16.258
Now I can work on my world changing
inventions right here from home.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.095
And I can help you
with the house-work.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.198
Oh, we'll be fine. I'm doing really well
at the office right now.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.025
That's important.

23:23.602 --> 23:24.729
I'm gonna get dinner ready!

23:25.037 --> 23:27.404
No!
Nope, I've already taken care of it.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.164
- You have?
- Yes.

23:32.878 --> 23:37.282
- Is that the smoke detector?
- Dinner's ready.

23:39.451 --> 23:42.683
So, anything exciting
at school today?

23:44.957 --> 23:48.519
Tyler? Earth to Tyler?

23:49.395 --> 23:49.987
Huh?

23:50.296 --> 23:52.993
Your dad just asked you a question,
how was school today?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.800
Oh, uh, yeah. It... it.. it was fine.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.204
Ah.

24:00.105 --> 24:00.970
Nice.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.742
May I be excused, please?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.408
Sure, honey.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.982
Let me know if get hungry later, okay?

24:27.566 --> 24:28.761
Hey?

24:29.802 --> 24:30.997
Hey.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.072
You all right?

24:37.509 --> 24:38.909
I guess.

24:40.045 --> 24:45.916
You know, if you're ready
and only if you're ready.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.315
We could go and look
for a new dog this week.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.455
New dog?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.726
I don't ever want a new dog!

24:59.131 --> 25:02.158
Nothing will ever replace him,

25:06.405 --> 25:08.067
I miss him so much.

25:10.175 --> 25:14.306
I know buddy we all do.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.112
I want him back.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.012
Please, can I have him back?

25:22.388 --> 25:25.950
That is the one thing, Tyler,
I wish I could do.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.691
- But, I can't.
- It hurts so much!

25:32.398 --> 25:34.367
Well, come here.

25:35.434 --> 25:38.029
Nothing wrong
with letting it out okay?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.268
Let me see.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.074
You know I've been there too.

25:49.114 --> 25:53.051
And it's tough,
but you can get through it.

25:53.452 --> 25:56.422
Hey, you feel a little better?

25:58.991 --> 26:01.688
Okay.
Come on, let's go to bed.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.936
Ow!

26:26.985 --> 26:32.322
That, is not a bad idea Mr. Austin.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.225
Where's dad?

26:41.166 --> 26:42.429
He's in the garage.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.035
Darling...

26:46.438 --> 26:48.236
I've come for your toaster.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.069
What is he working on?

26:50.375 --> 26:53.311
I don't know.
As long as he's not cooking.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.047
I heard that.

26:57.683 --> 27:01.415
And, I may or may not have
used portions of your bicycle.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.189
What? Mom! He just... Dad!

27:39.625 --> 27:42.356
Hey, Dad?
You okay in there?

27:42.628 --> 27:45.120
Hey, Tyler?
Is your mother out there?

27:45.631 --> 27:47.998
- I'm right here
- Oh, hi honey!

27:48.066 --> 27:52.003
Wait right here because
boy have I got a surprise for you.

27:53.172 --> 27:53.969
Hey!

27:54.206 --> 27:55.003
- Hi!
- Hi!

27:55.274 --> 27:56.970
What's goin on here?
What's going on with the car?

27:57.242 --> 27:59.211
- I needed some parts.
- What for?

27:59.545 --> 28:01.912
All will be answered momentarily.

28:02.080 --> 28:07.144
Let me present to you my latest
and greatest invention...

28:16.795 --> 28:18.525
The RK-9

28:19.364 --> 28:20.024
What is it?

28:20.332 --> 28:25.032
R stands for Robot,
k9 stands for dog. You get it?

28:26.071 --> 28:29.041
It's a robotic dog.
Check this out

28:36.281 --> 28:38.443
Nice invention Dad.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.081
Well, I'm having
some Power source issues. But...

28:45.424 --> 28:49.088
with a robot this advanced,
it takes a lot of power.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.829
I think it's great, Honey
I'm gonna um...

28:52.464 --> 28:54.194
I'm I'm gonna let
you clean up your creation

28:54.766 --> 28:56.132
and I'm gonna go into the house
and fix dinner.

28:56.535 --> 29:00.131
- I could cook dinner.
- No. Please.

29:01.006 --> 29:01.974
Yes, dear.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.349
Somethin' wrong with your car?

29:16.288 --> 29:17.449
Barry?

29:17.689 --> 29:20.659
You want me to take a look at it?
I took an online class once.

29:20.892 --> 29:21.587
Didn't pass.

29:22.094 --> 29:26.122
Oh, no... no... that's... that's fine.
What are you doing here Barry?

29:26.365 --> 29:29.028
Well, Mr. Willis wanted me
to box up all your stuff and...

29:29.134 --> 29:31.729
deliver it to you.
So, uh, here you go.

29:32.638 --> 29:33.628
Oh, thank you.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.235
Wait a minute.

29:37.175 --> 29:38.438
You got the battery back?

29:39.044 --> 29:41.445
Yeah, I also brought some uh...
staplers and your..

29:41.647 --> 29:45.516
No, Barry, you don't understand
this is the answer to all my problems.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.085
Oh, yeah? What is it
that you're workin on here?

29:48.086 --> 29:51.921
It's my latest invention.
A robotic dog.

29:52.557 --> 29:53.957
Oh, yeah!

29:55.394 --> 29:56.987
Doesn't do all that much.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.993
Well, you should have seen it
about an hour ago.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.823
Cuz it was working perfectly

30:01.066 --> 30:03.092
I've just had
some power issues but...

30:04.069 --> 30:06.732
this is the answer
to all my problems

30:07.773 --> 30:10.538
Before you electrocute me again.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.572
Oh, but I do want to give you this.
It's a gift.

30:13.712 --> 30:16.079
Uh, it's my solar powered scissors.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.607
I figured you could use them.

30:20.385 --> 30:24.288
Barry, I mean honestly,
thank you so much.

30:24.656 --> 30:28.718
No sweat.
And, good luck with your Robo Dog.

30:29.928 --> 30:34.298
Yeah... Robo Dog.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.293
ROBO-DOG

30:41.206 --> 30:46.907
Now, what I need to do
is reflect back the heat of the output

30:48.113 --> 30:50.947
and take that energy back
the main processor

30:51.016 --> 30:52.848
but, how am I going to do that?

30:54.486 --> 30:58.253
Unless I have a...

31:01.893 --> 31:03.156
solar panel?

31:06.765 --> 31:07.824
Barry...

31:10.068 --> 31:11.593
you may be...

31:12.003 --> 31:13.369
a genius.

31:15.774 --> 31:18.676
Temperature is steady.
Power refueling...

31:26.551 --> 31:27.951
I think I did it.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.047
Oh, yeah! I did it!

31:35.594 --> 31:37.324
Grandma's mink?

31:38.029 --> 31:39.292
Sorry Grandma.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.336
I miss you buddy.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.882
Dog, dog it's you!

32:00.152 --> 32:01.643
I love you!

32:02.154 --> 32:03.884
I love you, too Tyler.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.120
Do ya like him?

32:07.426 --> 32:08.394
What?

32:09.094 --> 32:11.723
Are you okay? DOG!

32:12.063 --> 32:14.225
- Not technical
- Hello, Miranda.

32:16.635 --> 32:17.694
What did you do?

32:18.069 --> 32:20.163
Family, may I introduce you.

32:20.672 --> 32:21.731
Robo-dog.

32:21.973 --> 32:22.736
Robo-dog?

32:23.074 --> 32:25.566
- Robo-dog?
- I am Robo-Dog

32:25.744 --> 32:27.610
Uh, how did you this?
Honey.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.006
Well, it was actually rather easy
once I figured out how to harness

32:31.416 --> 32:33.248
the incredible energy
from the super battery

32:33.485 --> 32:35.010
without burning the house down

32:35.687 --> 32:38.589
Why, does he look like Dog?

32:39.124 --> 32:41.320
Because, you said
that you wanted him back.

32:41.993 --> 32:43.052
And I don't know if you know this

32:43.328 --> 32:46.560
but bringing a dog back to life
is virtually impossible.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.167
Unless, your old man builds
you a robotic version.

32:50.168 --> 32:53.138
He's got some of the personality
traits of Dog,

32:53.438 --> 32:57.637
yet he doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep,
he doesn't chew on things,

32:58.043 --> 33:00.069
and Ma he doesn't poop or pee
in the house!

33:00.345 --> 33:03.110
- I like that, that's good.
- I thought you might like that.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.015
Isn't he the coolest?

33:05.116 --> 33:06.914
I am the coolest.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.351
I guess.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.915
Well... I'm gonna let you two
get acquainted.

33:13.558 --> 33:14.651
Good Champ.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.389
You too Tyler.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.792
- Get some sleep, honey.
- Yeah.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.761
Tyler.
You know he's doing this to

33:27.472 --> 33:28.735
cheer you up.

33:29.040 --> 33:33.808
I know but it's just weird...

33:34.145 --> 33:36.114
Yeah, well sweetie, just make effort.
I mean, who knows?

33:36.281 --> 33:38.512
You guys may end up
being the best of friends.

33:38.683 --> 33:43.053
- That would be swell.
- I... seriously doubt it.

33:44.322 --> 33:45.915
- Goodnight honey.
- Goodnight mom.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.084
- I love you.
- Love you.

33:48.593 --> 33:53.088
- I love you, too Miranda.
- Okay maybe this is a little weird.

33:56.668 --> 33:57.966
Just to let you know...

33:58.270 --> 33:59.863
I don't care what they say.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.731
We will never be friends... ever.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.807
Why won't we be friends?

34:06.144 --> 34:08.112
Well, number one...

34:08.346 --> 34:11.043
You won't stop staring at me.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.143
Why don't you blink?

34:14.452 --> 34:16.045
What is blink?

34:17.656 --> 34:20.056
Blink. This is blink.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.886
Like this?

34:22.327 --> 34:23.295
Yeah.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.893
What is number two?

34:25.030 --> 34:28.933
Number two is that you aren't
a real dog.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.427
That is correct.

34:30.768 --> 34:34.137
- You don't even act like a real dog.
- You can teach me.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.670
Why?

34:36.007 --> 34:37.168
Why not?

34:37.509 --> 34:38.340
Because.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.010
- Because, why?
- Because it's weird.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.808
Tyler, I do not want to be weird.

34:44.114 --> 34:48.018
I would really like to be more a real dog.
Please assist.

34:48.085 --> 34:53.389
Maybe. We can talk about it tomorrow.
I'm tired.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.051
I don't wanna think.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.568
- What is that?
- They are my eyes.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.534
- Are they flashlights?
- Affirmative.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.075
Why do you have flashlights
in your eyes?

35:10.175 --> 35:12.701
I use them to illuminate the night.

35:13.011 --> 35:17.005
Can you shut them off please?
Real dogs don't have flashlights in their eye.

35:17.315 --> 35:22.811
- Sorry.
- Okay. Thanks. Good night.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.883
Good night, Tyler.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.456
So, how's it going
with your new friend?

35:30.829 --> 35:33.526
Mom, I told you,
he's not my friend.

35:33.865 --> 35:37.165
Excuse me.
What are you guys doing today?

35:37.569 --> 35:39.765
Well, I'm teaching him
how to be a dog.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.168
Today's lesson is how to stay.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.430
Watch this.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.306
Robo-Dog, Stay.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.046
- Wow!
- Isn't that cool?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.083
He won't move at all until I say.
Come on.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.878
Now, watch this.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.142
Robo-dog up.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.082
Now, stay.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.083
Isn't that funny?

35:59.357 --> 36:00.882
Betcha he'll stay that way all day.

36:01.092 --> 36:04.995
Tyler, if you're not going to be nice to him,
you can do something productive, like,

36:05.163 --> 36:06.187
clean your room.

36:06.464 --> 36:09.901
Okay I'll play with him.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.661
Perfect, after you clean your room.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.004
Okay.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.266
C'mon.

36:27.752 --> 36:28.947
Can I help?

36:29.888 --> 36:32.949
I don't know,
can you clean all this for me?

36:33.091 --> 36:34.354
Affirmative.

36:38.596 --> 36:39.757
Cool.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.907
Vacuuming the rug Vacuuming the rug.
Do do do do doo.

36:59.984 --> 37:01.418
TYLER?

37:04.289 --> 37:05.552
What're you doing?

37:06.157 --> 37:07.489
Playing video games.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.358
I asked you to clean your room
not Robo-dog.

37:10.929 --> 37:11.919
What's the difference.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.164
Well, the difference is
is that your Dad made you a dog,

37:14.165 --> 37:16.691
not a maid that you can use
to clean your room

37:17.168 --> 37:20.138
Then why did he install
a vacuum in his butt?

37:20.205 --> 37:23.801
I have no idea what goes on inside
your father's head sometimes.

37:25.176 --> 37:29.511
- Hey. I just got to level fifty.
- I really don't care.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.043
Because what I need you to do right now
is take Robo-dog outside

37:33.184 --> 37:36.018
and teach him how to be a real dog
like you promised.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.489
- Let's go!
- Fine.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.715
C'mon Robo-Dumb

37:41.226 --> 37:44.560
It's Robo-Dog. It's Robo-Dog.

37:49.968 --> 37:53.871
Okay. First things first.
Let's see what you know.

37:54.405 --> 37:55.270
Sit!

37:56.107 --> 37:57.234
Pretty good.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.805
Something, still isn't right.

38:02.413 --> 38:05.008
Oh, I know do this.

38:06.084 --> 38:06.949
Why?

38:07.385 --> 38:10.412
- Real dogs do that all the time.
- Like this?

38:12.290 --> 38:15.260
Right. Now, lie down.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.597
Good. Now, let's do something
a little bit harder.

38:25.236 --> 38:26.568
Shake.

38:30.775 --> 38:35.008
- Whoa! What was that?
- It is my fifth arm.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.242
What other gadgets
do you have hidden in there?

38:38.483 --> 38:41.078
I have over 42 different techniques
and upgrades.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.878
Including night vision,
Heat sensors

38:44.155 --> 38:47.250
Rosetta stone,
a vacuum, and GPS.

38:47.725 --> 38:51.355
Okay, I got it.
SBack to dog stuff.

38:52.831 --> 38:53.958
This is a ball.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.090
We use this to play fetch.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.468
So, when I throw it, you're supposed
to run after it and bring it back to me.

39:00.839 --> 39:01.807
Why?

39:02.273 --> 39:04.936
Cuz, that's what dogs do.
I guess.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.706
- So, are you ready?
- Affirmative.

39:12.483 --> 39:13.746
Like that?

39:13.952 --> 39:15.011
What are you doing?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.553
You're supposed to run
after it and give it back to me.

39:18.122 --> 39:19.055
Why?

39:19.324 --> 39:21.122
Because, it's fun.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.458
Now, let's try that again."

39:32.637 --> 39:36.768
Well, that was a a little fast,
but it's a start.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.236
Now, you are being ridiculous.

39:41.479 --> 39:44.381
What? You're to keep fetching it
over and over.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.075
I thought you said this was fun?

39:47.485 --> 39:50.011
Forget it.
Let's try something else.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.581
Oh, I know!

39:55.126 --> 39:57.254
Okay take one side.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.764
With your mouth.

40:04.936 --> 40:05.995
Now what?

40:06.170 --> 40:08.036
You have to try to get it out
of my hand.

40:09.040 --> 40:09.939
See?

40:10.074 --> 40:11.872
You can't get it out...

40:16.281 --> 40:18.079
RO BO DOG

40:27.158 --> 40:29.650
That was fun.
Again, again!

40:30.361 --> 40:33.229
NO... No thank you.

40:34.632 --> 40:38.592
I think we need to do something that's
a little more safe... for me.

40:39.037 --> 40:39.970
Like what?

40:40.438 --> 40:43.931
Hey, I... I know
You can chase cars.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.199
Why?

40:45.743 --> 40:47.644
You want to be more like
a real dog, right?

40:48.012 --> 40:50.311
- Affirmative.
- There's a car right now.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.215
Go!

40:58.923 --> 41:01.688
What the heck's goin' on
for crying out loud.

41:02.694 --> 41:06.324
Robo-dog put the car down.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.535
That was fun!

41:13.571 --> 41:15.403
C'mon, I know a place we can go.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.011
What is this place?

41:26.751 --> 41:29.482
It's a dog park.
It's where you learn to become a dog.

41:29.721 --> 41:30.950
What do I do?

41:31.089 --> 41:32.853
One thing you can't do is talk.

41:33.358 --> 41:38.353
So, I guess just go around
and watch the other real dogs.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.096
See what they do.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.627
What is he doing?

41:45.269 --> 41:46.669
Sniffing your butt.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.234
Why?

41:48.973 --> 41:50.271
Actually, I don't know.

41:50.575 --> 41:54.034
A bunch of dogs do that because,
I guess that's a way to get to know you.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.844
Wow. Looks like a lot of dogs
want to get to know you.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.449
Awkward.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.946
Not as awkward
as someone hearing you talk!

42:02.120 --> 42:03.315
Sorry.

42:03.888 --> 42:04.856
Go fetch!

42:07.191 --> 42:08.284
I got it!

42:08.493 --> 42:10.553
Great!
One small step for dog kind.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.728
Wow, it's getting late.
We should get home.

42:13.931 --> 42:15.957
I think I'm getting the hang of this!

42:17.135 --> 42:19.001
Initiating GPS.

42:19.237 --> 42:22.799
Continue straight
for 30 and turn left

42:23.041 --> 42:24.566
I know where I'm going.

42:25.176 --> 42:30.444
- In 295 feet, turn left.
- Okay, that's really annoying.

42:31.115 --> 42:34.108
In 290 turn left

42:35.119 --> 42:36.951
- It's Chloe!
- Who is Chloe?

42:37.155 --> 42:40.157
- She's a girl I like.
- Have you sniffed her butt yet?

42:40.158 --> 42:41.990
- No.
- Do you want to sniff her butt?

42:42.093 --> 42:43.925
- No! That's gross.
- But...

42:44.028 --> 42:46.964
- Just, please be quiet.
- Hey, Tyler.

42:48.032 --> 42:49.796
Hi! Chloe!

42:50.334 --> 42:51.927
Oh, did you get a new dog?

42:52.003 --> 42:53.801
Uh... sort of.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.667
It looks just like dog.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.134
- What's his name?
- Robo-dog.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.278
No, really, what's his name?

43:00.912 --> 43:01.971
Robo-dog.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.115
He's a robot dog
my dad made for me.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.950
That's... cool.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.884
- You don't believe me?
- No...

43:09.987 --> 43:12.479
Here watch.
Say something Robo-dog?

43:16.360 --> 43:19.797
- That's a cute trick.
- It's not a trick.

43:20.731 --> 43:22.359
Sure.
So, what are you doing now?

43:22.633 --> 43:23.726
Just headin home.

43:24.168 --> 43:26.034
Oh, is it okay if I walk with you?

43:28.706 --> 43:29.730
Sure.

43:30.108 --> 43:33.101
- I mean, sure.
- Okay.

43:39.884 --> 43:42.251
- Thanks for walking me home.
- No problem.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.915
So, what're you doing tomorrow?

43:43.988 --> 43:46.719
Just teaching a new dog old tricks.

43:46.824 --> 43:50.124
Well, I'm going downtown,
maybe I'll see you and Robo-dog there.

43:50.428 --> 43:52.090
Uh... Sure.

43:52.430 --> 43:53.762
Okay. See ya!

43:59.470 --> 44:00.631
Here that, boy?

44:01.272 --> 44:03.468
Chloe just asked us to hang out
with her tomorrow.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.776
Chloe just asked me on a date!

44:08.412 --> 44:12.008
That's so great.
She asked me on a date.

44:14.986 --> 44:18.753
She asked me on on a date.
She asked me on a date.

44:21.125 --> 44:24.994
Don't look at me like I'm weird,
you're the robot dog.

44:27.598 --> 44:31.091
Hey! You look happy!
Did you guys have a good day?

44:31.202 --> 44:32.295
It was okay.

44:33.004 --> 44:36.065
And, what about you, Robo-dog?
Did you have a good day?

44:37.475 --> 44:38.943
What wrong with his audio?

44:39.143 --> 44:41.578
I don't know.
He stopped talking for no reason.

44:42.847 --> 44:43.906
That's weird.

44:45.483 --> 44:46.473
Okay.

44:50.087 --> 44:50.850
Bark.

44:51.789 --> 44:53.052
This is really odd.

44:54.091 --> 44:56.993
There's no reason for him
to be silent.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.020
Everything seems to be in order.

45:01.065 --> 45:03.227
I don't know what else to do
to make him unmute.

45:06.103 --> 45:08.038
Stop barking!!

45:13.044 --> 45:16.981
I don't understand why would
he need to bark that loud?

45:17.081 --> 45:21.109
I didn't mean for him to bark that loud,
sweetheart I just happened to find some car

45:21.319 --> 45:23.049
speakers up in the attic.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.054
Okay. Watch your ears.

45:27.558 --> 45:31.290
Robo-dog.
I command the to bark!

45:34.398 --> 45:35.366
Ow.

45:37.068 --> 45:40.527
So, Robo-dog
what did you guys do today?

45:41.172 --> 45:43.539
Today, Tyler taught me
how to be like a dog.

45:43.674 --> 45:46.166
He did?
And how did he do that?

45:46.944 --> 45:50.108
Robo-dog
show dad that you like him.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.009
Jiminy Jumpernuts

45:53.351 --> 45:55.047
Tyler, you tell him to stop
that right now

45:55.353 --> 45:57.652
- Okay, cut it out Robo-dog.
- Did I do something wrong?

45:58.089 --> 46:01.924
Robo-dog, that's not how you show
affection to humans.

46:02.126 --> 46:03.253
How do they?

46:04.128 --> 46:05.061
Like this...

46:07.798 --> 46:10.563
- Shake.
- Oh! Yes. Affirmative

46:12.169 --> 46:14.001
See what I've I've had to deal with?

46:14.305 --> 46:16.240
Oh come on,
we can work with that.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.634
Let's see what else?
Robo-Dog, ummmm

46:19.744 --> 46:22.873
- Like my face
- You want me to lick your face?

46:23.114 --> 46:26.915
Yeah, that's how dogs show their
masters that they love them.

46:26.984 --> 46:29.954
- Affirmative.
- Okay, here we go.

46:34.025 --> 46:37.689
That was like going down a waterslide
a hundred miles an hour with out any water.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.097
Leave a mark?

46:39.730 --> 46:43.531
- It's just okay, it's not anything.
- SNo... its fine... no really.

46:48.572 --> 46:52.168
I'm telling you, you're going
to love Epic's next big thing.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.771
It is simply...

46:55.646 --> 46:56.978
Hello?

46:59.083 --> 47:00.210
What is it Jerome?

47:00.918 --> 47:03.717
The Japanese investor?
He just pulled out.

47:04.855 --> 47:05.948
He did what?

47:06.390 --> 47:10.122
He said his faith in your product
is unfavorable.

47:10.361 --> 47:11.693
However...

47:12.163 --> 47:15.292
He would like to work with you
on something like the super battery.

47:15.599 --> 47:18.967
The super battery! That would solve
everything. Where's Belch?

47:20.204 --> 47:21.763
I'm right here, sir.

47:23.641 --> 47:26.076
Belch, I need that battery.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.003
Oh... I gave it to Tom.

47:28.212 --> 47:30.238
What do you mean,
you gave it to him?

47:30.648 --> 47:33.641
Oh, well, you said to return all
his stuff or I'd be fired. So...

47:34.285 --> 47:37.915
I don't care what I said.
We are on the verge of bankruptcy here.

47:38.055 --> 47:41.753
Go and get the battery
or your really fired.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.392
No problem.

47:50.835 --> 47:52.861
Sounds like you guys
could use a lozenge.

47:55.005 --> 47:59.136
What are you doing?
I told you go and get that battery.

47:59.276 --> 48:00.869
Oh, you mean now.

48:01.045 --> 48:03.207
Okay, you got it.
No problem.

48:05.916 --> 48:09.648
How have you lived so long
without hurting yourself.

48:10.788 --> 48:12.051
What do ya mean?

48:15.559 --> 48:17.289
I'm okay. I'm okay.

48:34.879 --> 48:35.847
Tyler.

48:36.113 --> 48:37.479
Hey Dad, watch this.

48:42.987 --> 48:44.120
Hey!

48:44.121 --> 48:47.387
All right! Come here,
let me check his battery.

48:51.128 --> 48:52.960
Oh, well would you look at that!

48:53.431 --> 48:57.232
No heat emissions. No leakage.
Everything seems to be working perfectly.

48:57.635 --> 48:59.103
The battery.

48:59.870 --> 49:01.133
Wanna get some lunch?

49:02.106 --> 49:05.338
- Meeting a friend, downtown.
- Oh, a friend, huh?

49:06.410 --> 49:08.470
- Need some money?
- Oh, no thank you.

49:08.646 --> 49:09.773
I got my allowance.

49:10.047 --> 49:11.982
Well, why don't you take
some money anyway

49:13.350 --> 49:15.478
get Chloe an ice cream
or something.

49:15.553 --> 49:19.251
Who is this Chloe
that you speak of?

49:19.890 --> 49:22.155
Your mother and I
were young once too.

49:22.393 --> 49:25.591
There isn't anything that you've gone through
that we haven't gone through as well.

49:26.063 --> 49:29.898
Except for maybe the robotic dog.
But...

49:30.801 --> 49:32.064
Have fun on your date, son.

49:32.136 --> 49:37.473
- I wouldn't really call it a date. I mean...
- Well, whatever you want to call it..

49:37.975 --> 49:39.773
Chip off the old block!

49:42.213 --> 49:43.306
Yeah...

49:45.983 --> 49:50.011
- Ah, man! The chain's missing.
- I believe it is now part of my drive unit.

49:50.387 --> 49:52.015
How're we gonna get downtown?

49:52.690 --> 49:53.953
Allow me.

49:55.826 --> 49:56.850
Grab on!

49:57.027 --> 49:58.962
Mr. Willis is gonna want to see this.

50:05.135 --> 50:06.125
Are you ready?

50:06.470 --> 50:08.837
Yeah. Wait. Ready for what?

50:13.043 --> 50:14.602
Gotta get that dog.

50:26.924 --> 50:27.983
Did you like that?

50:29.026 --> 50:30.119
That...

50:30.694 --> 50:31.753
was awesome!

50:32.129 --> 50:33.222
Thank you

50:33.597 --> 50:36.533
Hey, no more talking
while we're in town.

50:37.067 --> 50:39.093
We don't want attract
any attention.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.731
- Hey, Tyler
- Hey, Chloe.

50:44.275 --> 50:45.641
Hi, Robo-dog.

50:47.645 --> 50:49.204
I see he still isn't talking.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.415
Oh, I told him not to talk
while we were downtown

50:51.715 --> 50:53.013
so he could act like a normal dog.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.118
Say something Robo-dog.

50:57.288 --> 50:58.950
No, seriously, say something.

51:00.124 --> 51:01.353
He's so funny.

51:02.126 --> 51:03.116
Isn't he?

51:06.263 --> 51:10.496
Hey!
Wanna go get some cupcakes?

51:11.669 --> 51:12.693
Yeah, sure.

51:13.170 --> 51:15.036
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.674
Okay Stay Robo-dog.

51:18.008 --> 51:22.036
- Is he okay here all by himself?
- Yeah, here, watch this.

51:24.114 --> 51:25.980
Whoa!
How'd you train him to do that?

51:26.183 --> 51:27.913
I told you, he's a robot.

51:28.686 --> 51:29.710
Okay.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.063
Hey, there poochie.
Hey there boy.

51:46.804 --> 51:49.330
I'm just going to need you
to come with me. Okay?

51:49.607 --> 51:53.203
So, why don't you
just follow Uncle Barry

51:57.014 --> 52:00.644
Okay. I see you like to play.

52:00.918 --> 52:05.322
All right. Doggie toy!
Come on.

52:13.197 --> 52:14.631
Here you go!

52:16.567 --> 52:19.560
Giddy up.
Giddy up, little doggie.

52:28.646 --> 52:32.879
Listen, the thing is, here, uh, pooch...
you just need to come take a ride in my car.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.711
It'll be quick.

52:37.354 --> 52:38.947
No one ever wants
to come in my car.

52:39.323 --> 52:42.885
I see you chose the hard way.
The hard way you shall get.

52:50.267 --> 52:51.394
What, what could I do?

52:51.969 --> 52:54.063
I'm leveling with you here,
I need your help with this.

52:54.605 --> 52:56.369
Lemme just take a look here.

53:03.414 --> 53:05.246
Battery's gotta be in here
somewhere.

53:09.653 --> 53:13.112
What is that man doing to that dog?

53:20.264 --> 53:21.789
PERVERT!

53:24.001 --> 53:25.492
Nothin' to see here.

53:31.608 --> 53:34.806
All right, pooch.
I'm gonna give you one last chance.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.044
Are you coming with me?

53:38.449 --> 53:39.815
All right be that way.

53:41.452 --> 53:43.114
It's your funeral.

54:00.404 --> 54:02.839
There he is officer, that's the man.

54:03.107 --> 54:04.166
Hey.

54:05.209 --> 54:06.177
Get back here.

54:11.348 --> 54:13.442
- Thanks for the cupcake.
- No problem.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.019
Come here Robo-dog.

54:18.088 --> 54:21.456
So, anything exciting happen
while we were gone?

54:24.528 --> 54:26.121
You can talk now!

54:26.797 --> 54:28.561
Let's go into the pet store!

54:34.605 --> 54:35.971
I don't wanna hurt you.

54:36.173 --> 54:38.836
I just need that battery.
Gotcha!

54:39.877 --> 54:42.039
Hey! What are you doing
with my dog?

54:42.513 --> 54:45.711
Well... I'm a dog catcher
and this dog doesn't have the right tags.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.482
So, he's coming with me.

54:47.751 --> 54:49.117
You don't look like a dog catcher.

54:49.486 --> 54:51.819
Oh... I'm undercover.
So, if you want your dog back

54:51.989 --> 54:54.652
you come down with your papers
and then you can have your dog.

54:54.925 --> 54:56.120
Where are your papers?

54:57.561 --> 54:59.723
- Come again?
- Your papers?

54:59.997 --> 55:03.297
Your ID? To know that your
a real dog catcher?

55:03.600 --> 55:07.059
You want proof?
Yeah, well, I have papers...

55:08.505 --> 55:10.235
Robo-dog stay!

55:10.808 --> 55:13.710
Oh, getting heavy.

55:14.077 --> 55:15.101
Doh!

55:20.951 --> 55:23.113
All right.
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

55:23.987 --> 55:26.013
Sorry, kid, I'm taking this dog.

55:26.390 --> 55:28.120
Robo-dog volume max.

55:30.027 --> 55:31.120
Now BARK!!

55:35.199 --> 55:36.599
I'm gonna get you,

55:38.468 --> 55:40.198
and your little Robo-dog too!

55:41.772 --> 55:42.865
Robo-dog!

55:43.907 --> 55:45.034
Are you okay?

55:51.882 --> 55:55.046
Robo-dog volume down.

55:56.286 --> 55:58.221
- Are you okay?
- HUH?

55:58.555 --> 55:59.523
You ready to go?

55:59.890 --> 56:02.655
Uh..yeah... yeah... come on boy.

56:05.996 --> 56:08.192
- That was fun.
- Yeah! We should do it again some time.

56:08.432 --> 56:10.162
Yeah, that'd be great, see ya.

56:11.802 --> 56:15.000
Oh, I forgot.
I got something for you, Robo-dog.

56:20.477 --> 56:23.675
There, now it's official.

56:24.214 --> 56:26.080
Tell Chloe thank you!

56:26.250 --> 56:27.479
Thank you!

56:28.986 --> 56:30.079
Whoa.

56:30.254 --> 56:32.120
See told you.

56:32.489 --> 56:34.651
Chloe, dinner's ready.

56:35.525 --> 56:38.256
I gotta go. Bye!

56:48.772 --> 56:49.205
C'mon boy.

56:49.506 --> 56:52.066
She squeezed us.
Does that mean she likes us?

56:52.409 --> 56:55.811
I think she likes me.

56:56.046 --> 56:57.810
I think she likes me more.

56:58.148 --> 56:59.081
Why do you say that?

56:59.349 --> 57:01.841
She got me a collar
with my name on it.

57:04.521 --> 57:07.047
What in the Sam Hill
happened to you?

57:07.524 --> 57:10.926
- Robo-dog.
- I'm sorry, Robo-dog?

57:11.161 --> 57:12.151
Yes.

57:12.729 --> 57:14.960
What the heck is a Robo-dog?

57:15.432 --> 57:17.765
He's a robot dog.

57:18.135 --> 57:22.038
I don't have time for this Belch.
Did you get my battery?

57:22.272 --> 57:25.003
Well, I was out looking
for your super battery and Tom,

57:25.108 --> 57:28.806
he made this robot dog
called Robo-dog... I helped name it.

57:29.046 --> 57:33.677
Anyway, he's got super powers like
running fast and not moving.

57:34.484 --> 57:36.919
The long and the short of it is...
he barked off my clothes

57:37.154 --> 57:38.554
and I don't have your battery.

57:39.089 --> 57:42.719
You're telling me,
that Austin made that robotic dog

57:43.093 --> 57:45.961
and he's using the super battery
to power it?

57:46.096 --> 57:49.430
- You got it.
- That means he he got it working!

57:50.000 --> 57:53.835
And, if he can use the battery
to power that robotic dog,

57:54.104 --> 57:57.336
we can use it to power
even more marvelous things

57:57.474 --> 58:01.639
We are talking a power source
capable of powering the whole city!

58:02.079 --> 58:06.949
And that battery going to be mine!

58:16.293 --> 58:17.283
Out!

58:25.402 --> 58:26.995
I miss you buddy.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.871
Was that a TV show?

58:30.073 --> 58:32.542
It was a video I made to show
how much I loved Dog.

58:32.876 --> 58:35.277
Is this another way
to show affection?

58:36.013 --> 58:37.037
I guess.

58:37.748 --> 58:39.808
Can I watch it again?

58:40.250 --> 58:41.479
Sure.

58:42.786 --> 58:45.688
My name is Tyler Austin.
And this is my dog.

58:45.989 --> 58:48.356
His name is dog.

58:52.763 --> 58:53.924
Someone's calling you.

58:54.598 --> 58:56.567
Who is calling you
at this time of night?

58:59.669 --> 59:00.967
Mr. Willis.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.001
Mr. Willis.

59:04.007 --> 59:07.705
- This is Tom.
- Tommy boy!

59:08.345 --> 59:10.473
Uh... how can I help you at this hour?

59:10.947 --> 59:13.644
I'm calling with some good news.

59:14.084 --> 59:20.354
I want to pay you a substantial sum
of money to come back and work for me.

59:20.957 --> 59:23.984
Well... I really
appreciate the offer, Mr. Willis

59:24.294 --> 59:26.763
but, since you let me go,

59:27.164 --> 59:31.329
I've come appreciate how much
I didn't like working for you

59:31.735 --> 59:34.170
and working on my own
personal projects.

59:34.838 --> 59:36.238
I understand.

59:36.907 --> 59:42.869
So, how about I pay you for some of your
personal projects you know, like

59:43.080 --> 59:45.845
super battery you were working on.

59:46.049 --> 59:50.453
Mr. Willis. You know that the
super battery is far from complete

59:51.288 --> 59:54.986
I'm sure you've had time
to improve upon it.

59:55.392 --> 59:57.918
And, I'd like you to sell it to me.

59:58.161 --> 59:59.754
I don't understand?

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:05.295
What don't you understand?
I pay you, you give me the battery.

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.995
A... you know Mr. Willis...

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:14.100
I'm gonna have to turn you down.
And... I'm really sorry.

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.673
You will be sorry.

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.142
Excuse me?

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.512
I said, goodnight.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.883
I'm sure we'll be seeing
each other again, real soon.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:34.587
- What was that all about?
- He wanted to buy the super battery

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.958
- that's powering Robo-dog.
- Why would he wanna do that?

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.128
I don't know.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.572
- How did it go?
- That no good rotton so and so.

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.574
I'm gonna have to play hard ball
with him.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.448
Is that anything like baseball?

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:56.485
No!

01:00:57.087 --> 01:01:01.718
It means I'll have to use other ways
to get that battery.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:07.325
It seems like the technology would be yours
since he worked for you when he made it.

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:10.566
What was that?

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.026
Well, he was working for you
when he made it so,

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:17.835
- you funded the technology...
- Belch, you're a genius.

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:19.542
I always thought so.

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:23.470
One quick phone call to my lawyer,

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.715
and that battery's as good as mine!

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:34.322
Jerome!

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.089
This is so awesome!

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:46.328
Not as awesome as this!
Get ready for the thunder punch!

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:50.064
No!

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.533
I win!

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:54.100
Tyler, dinner's ready!

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:58.008
Okay mom.
Wait did dad cook it?

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.606
I heard that.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.247
And no.

01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:07.886
All right.
Well... looks like I gotta head out.

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.060
See you later.

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:14.130
Excuse me, I would like to show you
all a movie I made of Tyler.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:15.194
A what?

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:19.232
I made a movie about you using the
video content stored in my data base.

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:22.435
- I didn't know he could do that.
- Neither did I.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:25.338
I made it to show
how much I love him.

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:28.111
- Would you like to see it?
- Yeah, sure. I'd love too.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.982
This is Tyler.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.408
He is my best friend.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:38.120
Robo-dog, pick a card.

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:39.316
He does a lot of fun things.
Like

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:41.124
- play with me.
- No! Don't say it out loud!

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.589
Robo-dog, catch!

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.962
Now throw it back,
hard as you can!

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.495
He likes to sing.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.962
He really likes to dance.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:57.363
I really think, he likes Chloe.
And may one day sniff her butt.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:58.868
Okay!

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:00.006
Turn it off!

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:04.044
- It is not finished.
- I don't care, shut it off.

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:06.881
I can't believe you.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.618
Tyler is something wrong?

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:15.755
- I... I... gotta go.
- Okay see ya.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.190
Goodnight.

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:25.399
- Tyler, what's wrong?
- Stupid Robo-dog that's what's wrong.

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.861
Are you upset
with something I've done?

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.606
Upset? No. I'm furious!

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:32.976
You embarrassed me
in front of Chloe!

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:34.803
Did I?

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:38.845
- No, you didn't. It was cute.
- Yeah, Tyler she seemed to enjoy it.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.609
Enjoy it?
She was laughing at me.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.748
Why would you show her
that stuff anyways?

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.614
To show her we are great friends.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:53.091
Great friends?
No. We are not great friends.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:59.168
You're but a bunch of spare parts
my dad took from the garage.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.606
Wrapped you up into fur, fooling people
into thinking you're a dog.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:05.235
Well, guess what?
You're not.

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:06.974
You never will be.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:10.079
- So stop trying so hard.
- Hey, Tyler...

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.745
- You're going to hurt his feelings.
- Well, he hurt mine.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.548
Besides, just a robot...

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.916
he doesn't have any feelings.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.719
Tyler, go to your room right now,
I'm serious!

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.187
Right now.

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:26.760
- Fine.
- Now.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:33.763
He doesn't mean it,
Robo-dog He's upset.

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.406
Why don't you come inside, okay?

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:50.050
Is that Mr. Willis?

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.356
What's he doing here?

01:04:56.493 --> 01:05:00.362
I told you on the phone
s I'm not interested in selling.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:03.991
Who said anything about selling?
I'm taking.

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:05.829
I beg your pardon?

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:10.236
I have a contract signed by you
when you started working for me

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:16.112
that anything you did while on my payroll
belongs to Epic Industries.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:20.405
So that baby belongs to me!

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:25.318
Well, I'm sorry because
Robo-dog belongs to my son.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:26.953
And your not taking him.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:30.992
I don't want your son's mangy mutt.
I want the battery inside.

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.186
Can you believe this?

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:38.034
So... you can give it to me now, or,
I'll sue you for everything you've got

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:39.692
and I'll take it anyway!

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.802
Well, then, I'll see you in court.

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:46.771
And for now you can take the contract
And get off my driveway!

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.978
You're gonna be sorry
you said that Mr.Austin.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:59.549
Mr. Willis?
Please don't hurt my family.

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.755
Is this what you want?

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:04.888
Take it.

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.563
ROBO-DOG!

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:17.573
It is for the best...

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:23.840
Robo-dog!

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:35.916
Robo-dog.
Robo-dog wake up!

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:39.290
- Robo-dog!
- Sorry about your dog.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:43.023
Nothing personal.
Just business.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.764
You'll understand someday.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:51.935
Drive, Belch.

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:10.876
Hey, Tom.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.114
What're you doing here?
Barry?

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.949
I came to say I'm sorry.

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:17.984
I'm really sorry for what I did.

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:21.087
I feel real bad.
Yeah, well...

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:24.096
You got a lot nerve showing up here.

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:28.234
Just, that, Mr. Willis was yelling
and calling me names. And...

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:31.238
I just never knew I'd feel so bad
about helping him.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.377
Yeah, well, I figured as much.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.442
You need some help?

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:41.013
Not unless you got twenty-five
car batteries in your pocket.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:45.051
Well, uh... no... I do have this!

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.350
Is that what I think it is?

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.929
I don't know
do you think it's the super battery?

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:56.296
- Yes, I do!
- Oh.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:09:00.001
Sorry, it's in pieces.
Mr. Willis and a scientist took it a part.

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:03.469
That's okay. That's okay.
Because I can fix this.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:07.238
But, you my friend are forgiven.

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.703
Well, hey! Let's get to work.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:20.048
- Barry!
- Sorry, should not have that.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.122
My bad.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.784
I... AM... ROBO-DOG!

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.086
Robo-dog?

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.889
- Did you fix him?
- We fixed him.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.430
- Barry brought the battery.
- Who's Barry?

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.299
Hola!

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:43.163
Hey, weren't that guy?

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.874
Who tried to steal Robo-dog
a couple days ago?

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:48.638
Yeah! You dressed up like
a dog catcher!

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:50.038
That may have been me.

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:52.906
Dad, this guy is bad news.
You need to get him out of here.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:57.014
Tyler, Barry has made some mistakes,

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.951
but he's sorry.
And he's our friend.

01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:03.787
Yeah, I'm a Tyler.
I'm... really sorry.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:05.186
Hello, Tyler!

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:07.757
Robo-dog!

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:13.594
- You're alive!
- Not technically Tyler.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:16.669
I am just a bunch of spare parts,
like you said before.

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:20.999
Yeah, sorry about that.
You know what?

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.574
You're the best bunch of spare parts
a boy could ask for,

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.074
I didn't know that before.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.549
I love you, buddy.

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:33.016
I love you, too. Tyler.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.282
I want to thank you
for bringing the battery.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.357
No problem.

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.721
I mean, how did you get it
from Mr. Willis?

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.692
Well, he didn't now
that he's got one of his own.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.192
What do you mean,
he's got one of his own?

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:47.629
Yeah, he and that guy from Japan.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:50.039
They made a... gigantic version
of your super battery

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.333
and they're gonna unveil it
for town this afternoon.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:53.971
The mayor's gonna be there
and everything.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:56.272
- A gigantic version?
- Yeah.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.872
- Oh no.
- What?

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.817
Oh no, they... there's no way

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:05.954
that they would have known
to incorporate the solar panels.

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:10.122
That the battery could overheat
and it could explode. How big is this thing?

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:14.091
Oh... I'd say it's about
the size of a... bus.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:17.089
A battery that big
could blow up half this town.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.326
I gotta call Mr. Willis
right now.

01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:30.046
Mr. Willis's phone,
Jerome speaking.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.478
Jerome, this is Tom Austin.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:35.717
I demand to speak
with Mr. Willis, right now.

01:12:37.153 --> 01:12:41.147
He's a little busy, right now and I'm
pretty sure he doesn't want to talk to you.

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.983
If you don't put him
on the I'm gonna tell him

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:44.752
that you like to take his clothes
and dress up in them

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.687
when you pick up his dry cleaning.

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:50.633
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, you bet I would.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.595
Mr. Willis. Phone's for you.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.030
- Who is it?
- Tom Austin.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.869
Tom, what can I do for you?

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.943
Barry told me what you're planning...

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:09.348
Belch?
Where is that pain in my side?

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:11.417
He's stading right here.

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:12.450
Really?

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:16.189
- Give him the phone.
- He wants to talk to you

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.159
This is Barry.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.426
Belch, you're fired.
Now, hand the phone back to Tom.

01:13:21.664 --> 01:13:22.563
Yes sir.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.360
This is Tom.

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:28.031
Tell me what want,
I have an event to run.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.206
You cannot go through the unveiling.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:33.133
The battery's too dangerous,
you don't understand.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.505
What are you talking about?

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.575
It worked perfectly fine
in your robot dog.

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:39.841
That's because I altered that battery...

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.075
Altered it.
Industrial sabotage.

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:46.015
Industrial sabotage?

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:50.057
Let me guess,
you want me to pay you to fix it.

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.685
What? No...

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.421
You can forget about blackmailing me.

01:13:56.632 --> 01:14:00.865
I've got my top guys on this project.
It is going to be fine.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:05.064
- You don't understand how dangerous...
- Goodbye Tom.

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:08.973
Yes sir.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:12.913
Make sure security doesn't let Austin
or Belch anywhere near the unveiling.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:14.015
Yes sir.

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:17.050
- He's going to go through with it.
- Oh no.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.645
He could hurt a lot of people.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.053
We've got to stop him.
You in?

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:22.949
Of course.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:25.058
- You in?
- I don't have a job, anyway.

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:28.029
- Robo-dog What about you?
- Affirmative.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.232
Gentlemen.

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:30.965
Let's save the town.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:36.799
It's a beautiful right here out-side
Epic Industries for this...

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:38.405
Mr. Willis. Mr. Willis!

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:42.211
Can you give us a little hint of
what this big announcement may be?

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:44.880
EPIC!
Epic announcement.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:47.744
Okay right.
All right, could you please tell us

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.485
some hint of what this
big announcement may be?

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.349
Well... You'll find out soon enough!

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:56.954
Mr. Willis, can you please
comment on theatrics...

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:02.028
are here to cover up the lack
of an Epic announcement.

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:08.666
Well, my comment is they're
gonna be eating those words

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:13.372
because I speculate.
I speculate.

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:18.077
That this is gonna be
the best news that you..

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:21.117
And anyone else here
has ever heard.

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:28.049
And I'm going to go in
and meet the mayor.

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:35.898
Big words
from an even bigger ego.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:39.434
We'll keep you live right here
from Epic Industries.

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:46.732
How we gonna get in?

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:49.808
I don't know.
We need some kind of distraction.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:55.141
- Barry, what are you doing?
- I'm making a distraction.

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:03.320
- Why is he taking his cloths off?
- Because he's a strange man son.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:10.092
- Hey! Look at me! Look at me!
- Hey, stop.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.969
Who also, happens to be a genius.
Let's go.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:22.469
I think they spotted us.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.873
Don't worry Dad.
You can go we got this

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.115
You sure?

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.644
Good luck, Tom.

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:30.146
Thanks, son.

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:40.888
Was that you?

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:43.758
Get over here!

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.400
Hey!
Why're you running away from me?

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:51.805
What's your problem?
What are you and your little dog doing?

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.566
Tyler, duck.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:00.515
Whoa!

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.113
Come on, Robo-dog, Come on.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:06.688
Come pick me up they got me.
I'm at the security gate.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:08.253
Where are you going?

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.090
Ladies and Gentlemen,
if you make your way to main stage.

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:16.296
Epic Industries main presentation
will begin momentarily.

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:18.166
Thank you.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.363
- Sorry boss.
- Get him!

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:29.103
Hey, you, kid. Come back here.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.277
- I said get back here.
- Robo-dog stay!

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.442
We're gonna get him.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.987
Sorry.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:46.488
My back!

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.998
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- C'mon boy, it's starting

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.831
it is my honor...

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:56.871
no... a visionary.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:02.604
Who has single handedly changed the lives
of so many including my own.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:06.082
His business charm and savvy

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:10.151
are unmatched by anybody
I have ever known...

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.515
Thank you.

01:18:12.555 --> 01:18:18.051
Thank you. Thank you for that...
that... humbling speech Jerome.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:20.456
- You're welcome sir.
- Go sit down.

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:25.525
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:29.232
When I was a child,
I had dreams...

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:32.131
much like all you in the audience had

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:37.972
had a dream to be something
greater than anyone else.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:41.811
I dream to create something that
would make people wonder

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:45.349
how they ever survived without it.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:50.916
A dream to create
something truly Epic.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:57.395
But, today, I don't present
to you words of a dream.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:01.870
Today, I present to you a reality.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:11.513
Today, I present to you a technology
that truly embodies everything

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.449
that Epic Industries stands for...

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.083
the...

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:18.912
the...

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.180
the...

01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:25.122
- Jerome!
- Sorry.

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:31.830
The Epic.. SUPER BATTERY!

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:38.430
With the Epic Super Battery

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:46.104
you don't need to rely on traditional
forms of energy ever again.

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.215
Mr. Mayor

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.392
Will you have the honor
of turning it on please?

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:58.891
Yes, of course.

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:01.787
Wait!!

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.793
Don't do it Mr. Mayor.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:07.627
- Well, what's the meaning of this?
- Ignore him.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.035
He's a disgruntled employee.

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:15.066
I fired... a disgruntled employee
I fired for stealing.

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:20.080
Seriously, Mr. Mayor
if you turn that thing on,

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.612
you risk blowing up half the town.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:27.522
Please, listen to my dad.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.288
He created it.

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:30.948
He did?

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:36.598
I assure you everyone.
This is completely safe.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:41.262
It's been checked out by my top scientist.
Right... bud?

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.367
Willis, I don't know
this all sounds very dangerous.

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:47.973
Perhaps we should postpone
until we know it's safe.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:51.241
I already told you it was safe.
Watch this!

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.645
No!

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.214
See!

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.124
Isn't it magnificent?

01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:04.585
Well, maybe he did fix it.

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:11.024
Everybody, don't panic.
Stay calm.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.992
That thing's gonna blow!

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:18.233
Panic and run.

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:22.105
Grab Robo-dog and get as many people
as you can to a safe distance.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.844
- What about you?
- I'm gonna try and shut this thing down.

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:27.810
Be careful.
Okay, folks

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.315
I need all of you to go back to cars.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.955
- Shut it off, Willis.
- I can't.

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:35.124
Well, why not?

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.522
I don't know how.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.987
What about the emergency
shut-off switch?

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:43.122
Oh, I took out the emergency
shut-off to save money!

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:46.893
Well that was of you.
Why would you do something like that?

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:52.731
- Why would I ever need to shut it off?
- Maybe for a situation just like this?

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:58.047
Look, I don't understand.
It worked perfectly in your machine.

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:01.914
Why doesn't it work in mine?
It's exactly the same.

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:04.954
Wait a minute
exactly like mine?

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.723
Well, except
for the emergency shut-off.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:08.922
Oh, boy.

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.081
OH, BOY

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.095
If we can remove these in time,

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.697
hopefully we can lower
the output rate.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.937
Mr. Soto, I assure this
is only a minor set back.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:25.404
Mr. Willis, you are a fool!
This is not minor setback.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.267
This is major castasrophe!

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:46.994
I can't get the last two fuses.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:49.121
Hopefully the explosion
will be contained!

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:55.228
DAD! Robo-dog, help my dad.
I'll take care of the people.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.803
I'm on it.

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:05.371
Look at this! It's beautiful!
My greatest invention ever!

01:23:06.849 --> 01:23:09.318
Mr. Willis,
will stop laughing and run.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.611
Tom, get out of there!

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:22.695
MR. WILLIS!!

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.002
Dad?

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:39.715
Dad?

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:43.881
- Dad? Dad? Are you Okay?
- Yeah, son. Are okay?

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:46.021
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.658
Where's Robo-dog?

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.086
Oh no.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:56.593
Son.

01:23:57.132 --> 01:23:58.430
I'm sorry.

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.092
It's ok.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:05.802
He sacrificed himself to save you

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.875
He's definitely a hero.

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.804
And my friend.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.522
Robo-dog!

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:21.852
Mr. Willis.

01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:25.586
Is he dead?

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:29.792
Robo-dog give him a zap.

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.194
Clear.

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:37.004
What happened?

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:40.007
- Robo-dog saved you, Mr. Willis.
- He did?

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.011
Whoa, so he did.

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:45.514
Thanks, Robo-dog

01:24:48.317 --> 01:24:51.947
Oh, Tom. I owe you
and your family an apology

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:56.891
I was blinded by fame
and money and

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.787
I forgot I was hurting people
on the way.

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.355
Will you all ever be able
to forgive me?

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:07.966
Of course we will Mr. Willis.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.769
I think I'm gonna be in trouble
with the mayor.

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:17.843
Yeah, you think you're gonna be in trouble.
I'm gonna be in trouble with my wife.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.704
Robo-dog

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.484
- call mom...
- Calling mom.

01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:24.778
You really need to teach me
all the things that he can do.

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.251
So... that was our adventure.

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:29.456
After the incident.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:33.118
Mr. Willis had to do some community
service for almost blowing up the town

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:37.593
But, when it was done he saved
Epic Industries with his latest creation.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.935
Toy versions of Robo-dog

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:42.060
They were a huge hit at Christmas

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.571
coming in second
to the solar powered spatula,

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.238
invented by our very own,
Barry Melch.

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:51.038
With the solar powered spatula,
you do the cooking right in the spatula!"

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.373
After word got out
about the super battery.

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:55.480
My dad was recognized for his work

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:59.088
and received top rewards
in the field of energy and robotics.

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:02.950
As for me, I learned it's okay
to open my heart to a new friend.

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.093
And that friend is Robo-Dog.

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:07.958
The greatest robot dog
a kid could ask for.

01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:10.031
Happy Birthday, Robo-Dog!

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:11.993
YAY.

01:26:14.069 --> 01:26:15.628
Great work kid.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:19.539
I especially liked
the section about me.

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:21.976
It was good.

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.642
Loved it Tyler!

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:29.084
- Okay. You guys ready to eat?
- Chloe licked your face?

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:31.152
I think she likes you.

01:26:31.153 --> 01:26:33.850
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.488
And I owe it all to you.

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:37.759
- Oh.. hey...
- You're my best friend.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.989
Happy Birthday buddy.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:41.792
Thanks, Tyler.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.589
Oh, Wanna play catch?

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:46.192
Sure come on. Come on, boy

01:26:47.305 --> 01:26:53.480
