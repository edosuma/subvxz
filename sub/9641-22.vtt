00:00.940 --> 00:03.280
Guys. Guys! Is the mail here yet?

00:03.320 --> 00:05.130
Oh, Justin.

00:05.350 --> 00:08.790
You have been so anxious
about the mail all week, honey.

00:08.830 --> 00:12.510
It's just a $1.25
rebate on maple syrup.

00:12.550 --> 00:15.900
Give him $2.50 to get him
to stop talking about it, Jerry.

00:15.930 --> 00:18.490
I don't carry that kind of cash.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.180
How about half a banana.

00:21.910 --> 00:24.340
OK, uh, no.
It's not about the rebate.

00:24.380 --> 00:27.670
The creators of the Captain Jim
Bob Sherwood comics have retired.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.600
They're holding a contest
to find the replacements.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.030
I'm waiting to see if I won.

00:31.070 --> 00:33.500
And boy, am excited.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.400
I won a contest once.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.860
Worst reader.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.860
I think that's what the letter said.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.830
Why don't they just e-mail you the results,
like they do with all contests nowadays?

00:47.860 --> 00:50.790
'Cause every time I open up an
e-mail that says I won a contest,

00:50.830 --> 00:53.930
it's really just someone
trying to sell me vitamins.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.330
I got the mail.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.930
Justin, your vitamins are here.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.930
This is it.
This is it!

01:04.959 --> 01:07.130
If they allow me the honor
of being the new writer

01:07.160 --> 01:09.130
for the Captain Jim
Bob Sherwood comics,

01:09.160 --> 01:12.660
I'll be a hero to kids everywhere and...
...and myself.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.830
Mm-mm! Don't you get kids
involved in your pathetic life.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.900
I won!
It says it right there.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.830
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.470
Of course you did, son.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.630
You know what I'm wondering?

01:30.670 --> 01:33.530
How many people actually
entered the contest.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.700
This is truly one of the
greatest moments of my life.

01:39.740 --> 01:44.270
I can't think of anything in this world
that can bring me down right now.

01:44.310 --> 01:46.200
Here. Let me try.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.470
I won the contest, too.

01:47.510 --> 01:49.140
What?

01:49.170 --> 01:51.370
How...? No way.

01:51.410 --> 01:52.470
You don't write.

01:52.510 --> 01:54.110
No. I draw.

01:54.140 --> 01:56.770
And apparently good.
Check out this e-mail.

01:59.010 --> 02:00.340
Congratulations, Alex Russo,

02:00.380 --> 02:01.980
you have been selected
as the new artist

02:02.010 --> 02:05.040
for the Captain Jim Bob
Sherwood comics.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.350
There aren't words that can
describe how I feel right now.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.750
Just...

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:20.120 --> 02:21.220
How is this possible?

02:22.620 --> 02:24.690
I entered the contest because

02:24.720 --> 02:26.860
I knew it would drive
you crazy if I won.

02:28.530 --> 02:29.690
I won.

02:31.030 --> 02:34.460
Well, it looks like
you're both winners.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.300
Jerry, I don't think you understand.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.330
Now they have to work together.

02:38.370 --> 02:39.900
Oh, my gosh.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.930
We're all losers.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.540
- Whoa.
- Oh!

03:42.080 --> 03:43.540
What is that smell?

03:43.580 --> 03:46.110
Justin and Alex are off
making their comic book.

03:46.150 --> 03:48.110
So, it just makes sense for me to help

03:48.150 --> 03:50.210
by coming up with
a special scent for it.

03:51.450 --> 03:53.080
Here, check it out.

03:53.110 --> 03:55.410
I'm making a scent that
smells like excitement,

03:55.450 --> 03:57.750
adventure and just a
little bit of mystery.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.250
What could that possibly smell like?

03:59.290 --> 04:00.720
Welcome to the mystery part.

04:03.290 --> 04:04.860
Oh!

04:04.890 --> 04:07.060
- Oh!
- What is that stink?

04:07.090 --> 04:09.160
- Whoo!
- Did a cow die in here?

04:10.730 --> 04:13.370
Your little brother is making a scent

04:13.400 --> 04:15.200
to go with your comic book.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.240
OK, dude, that's ridiculous.

04:18.269 --> 04:20.540
The Captain Jim Bob Sherwood
stories are classics

04:20.570 --> 04:23.780
that do not rely on gimmicks
to sustain their popularity.

04:23.810 --> 04:27.740
Got it. I'm gonna come up with a
popularity smell for your comic book.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.050
I'm gonna need to find
some deodorant first.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.120
Popular kids tend to wear deodorant.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.120
Look.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.950
Before you guys start
working together,

04:37.990 --> 04:40.090
I wanna make one thing
perfectly clear.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.920
Do not come to your mother
and me with your problems.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.460
That's right.
It's not that we don't care.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.260
This seems like a regular
brother and sister problem.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.770
Not "There's a black hole
in the Sub Station

04:51.800 --> 04:54.670
sucking in the universe"
kind of problem.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.400
When are you gonna let that go?

04:57.440 --> 05:00.570
When someone finds my storage box

05:00.610 --> 05:02.740
full of my Christmas sweaters.

05:02.810 --> 05:05.480
I don't think the black hole
got rid of those.

05:05.510 --> 05:07.650
No, it was the black hole.
It was.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.680
All right, look.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.690
You guys don't have to worry about us.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.060
'Cause I got the whole comic
book mapped out right here.

05:15.090 --> 05:16.190
Good.

05:16.220 --> 05:18.260
Well, your father and I are gonna go

05:18.290 --> 05:21.600
pick out paint swatches
for our bedroom.

05:21.630 --> 05:25.170
Can't wait. Nothing goes
with a torn comforter

05:25.200 --> 05:28.440
and a broken dresser like fresh paint.

05:30.770 --> 05:33.310
OK. So, we're going to do a
classic Captain Jim Bob story

05:33.340 --> 05:36.010
of intergalactic exploration and
the pursuit of space justice.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.110
Now...
I thought he was a rancher.

05:41.180 --> 05:42.780
No.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.250
He's not a rancher.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.320
He's a farmer.

05:46.350 --> 05:49.150
When he's not on a mission for a
secret department of the US government

05:49.190 --> 05:52.190
he lives on a farm in Wyoming.

05:52.220 --> 05:56.330
A crime-fighting
farmer in space?

05:57.060 --> 05:58.460
Really?

06:00.300 --> 06:02.030
Yes. Really.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.300
Read some back issues.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.870
Do you even know what he looks like?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.640
That's him right there
with the thumbs up.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.740
That's his signature thumbs up.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.210
Anyway...

06:12.240 --> 06:15.050
It does not matter what the previous
comic books have done with him.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.550
This one is ours.

06:16.580 --> 06:18.520
So, let's go our own way.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.750
Here. Check it out.
Check it out. OK.

06:20.790 --> 06:26.660
Look. All right. So...
Here's Captain Jim Bob enjoying a taco

06:26.690 --> 06:29.090
while the girl pirates...

06:29.130 --> 06:32.860
See the pretty one
has a peg-leg. Only her.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.230
...are checking out
his space rocket.

06:35.270 --> 06:39.870
OK. And then...
A bear comes

06:39.910 --> 06:44.240
and he slaps the taco out of
his hand, eats the rocket,

06:44.280 --> 06:48.080
and then takes the girl pirates
to a really cool club.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.120
Where... OK, wait.
Where the girl...

06:54.150 --> 06:55.620
Where the girl pirates get in,

06:55.650 --> 06:57.920
but the bear gets stopped at the rope

06:57.960 --> 06:59.960
because he doesn't have his ID.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.590
I...
I don't want to hear it!

07:02.630 --> 07:05.300
These aren't the things that
Captain Jim Bob Sherwood does.

07:05.330 --> 07:07.160
He has a girlfriend.
Jessica Moon.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.500
And he only eats the things
he grows on his farm:

07:09.530 --> 07:11.200
Spinach and apples.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.770
Now, look, OK.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.900
I've drawn up some rudimentary
drawings I thought the artist,

07:15.940 --> 07:18.010
you, could use as inspiration.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.170
So, check 'em out.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.910
Labeled some things to help you.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.550
Get right to it here.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.080
Oh! Those are awesome!

07:28.120 --> 07:29.350
Thank you.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.820
They actually took me a long time.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.320
No, I mean they're awesome.

07:34.350 --> 07:37.750
Like they're so horribly bad
they're hilarious.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.260
Just draw 'em, OK?

07:39.290 --> 07:41.530
It's your job to draw my stories.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.400
No. It's your job to write stories
that go with my drawings.

07:45.430 --> 07:46.900
Your stories don't work.

07:46.930 --> 07:50.730
Captain Jim Bob has never
had a taco or met a bear.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.470
Well, then we should do that.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.340
Don't you think he should
have the experience

07:54.410 --> 07:56.470
of eating a crunchy chicken taco alone

07:56.510 --> 07:58.870
while a bear takes
girl pirates to a club?

07:59.940 --> 08:01.940
No! No, he should not!

08:01.980 --> 08:03.410
These are not the things he does.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.810
Spinach and apples!

08:07.680 --> 08:10.150
Well...
I am not drawing that.

08:10.180 --> 08:13.790
So... Good luck trying
to find someone

08:13.820 --> 08:16.190
that'll read a book with no pictures.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.860
Ha! Not all books
have pictures.

08:18.890 --> 08:22.130
Ha! Yes, they do, because if they
didn't they wouldn't be books.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.530
They would be homework!

08:26.900 --> 08:29.330
You can't just
run away from this, Alex.

08:29.370 --> 08:32.870
Mom, Dad, Alex doesn't want
to help on the comic book.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.270
She wants to make a crazy version

08:35.309 --> 08:38.340
that talks about bears and tacos.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.110
Mmm. Tacos.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.640
Oh, no.
We're not getting involved.

08:42.679 --> 08:46.450
It is our vision.
We can do whatever we want.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.720
We told you we're
not getting involved.

08:48.750 --> 08:51.150
You two need to work
this out together,

08:51.190 --> 08:52.620
just like your father and I.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.090
Together, we decided

08:54.120 --> 08:57.520
that we're painting our
bedroom Miami Sunburn.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.660
What? No, we didn't.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.130
We're keeping it beige.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.430
Jerry, our room's not beige.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.160
It's white that's dirty
enough to call beige.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.630
Exactly!

09:07.670 --> 09:09.070
Why paint the walls

09:09.100 --> 09:12.140
when the colors are gonna
change by themselves?

09:12.170 --> 09:14.540
Ah! Forget about them.

09:14.570 --> 09:16.840
Look. There's Harper.
She'll decide who's right.

09:16.870 --> 09:18.140
Hey, Harper.

09:20.780 --> 09:22.040
No!

09:28.450 --> 09:31.520
- Hi, Harper.
- How are things?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.050
Oh, don't look so worried.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.090
We just want you to decide

09:37.120 --> 09:40.390
whose artistic vision is
better for our comic book.

09:40.430 --> 09:43.160
I just don't pick sides
in fights involving wizards

09:43.200 --> 09:46.700
who could possibly turn me into
something like a beautiful mermaid.

09:46.730 --> 09:49.430
Wait. Harper's right.

09:49.470 --> 09:51.170
We should use magic.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.170
OK.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.240
Don't even think about that.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.640
<i>This is causing</i>
<i>too much strife.</i>

09:54.670 --> 09:56.510
<i>From the pages</i>
<i>come to life.</i>

09:58.140 --> 09:59.440
Oh, my gosh!

09:59.480 --> 10:05.280
I cannot believe that...
You are here in front of me.

10:05.310 --> 10:06.680
Hey, kids.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.080
This ain't no job for no farmer.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.850
This is a Captain Jim Bob job.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.590
That's what he says!

10:16.660 --> 10:19.120
What seems to be the
problem, little lady?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.830
Oh, no. My mom told me not to
talk to men in astronaut suits.

10:22.860 --> 10:24.760
It can only lead to heartbreak.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.100
Curse you, John Glenn.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.940
Captain, sir, we're working
on your next adventure.

10:32.970 --> 10:36.410
I have the creative vision and she's
just the artist who carries that out.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.640
Well, that's some wonderful news.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.410
Stanley Nothisname, the old
artist, he was really slipping.

10:42.450 --> 10:43.750
Did you see the last issue?

10:43.780 --> 10:45.980
He forgot to draw in my space belt.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.150
I had a heck of time
keeping my space pants up.

10:48.190 --> 10:53.260
We need you to decide which one of our
stories you'd like to be a part of.

10:53.290 --> 10:56.630
Well, I'm not really
involved in those decisions.

10:56.660 --> 11:00.600
I just sort of show up
and say the words.

11:00.630 --> 11:04.130
I'm sure whatever you do, as long
as you make me look like a hero,

11:04.170 --> 11:06.070
will be fine with me.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.240
So, sir, you wouldn't mind
fighting outer space injustice

11:09.270 --> 11:10.740
and then going home to relax

11:10.780 --> 11:15.210
in Farmtown with a nice big bowl
of spinach and apples?

11:15.250 --> 11:17.450
He just said that he doesn't care.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.520
So he won't mind beating up
a bear that spits fire

11:20.550 --> 11:22.920
and then rewarding himself
with a lovely, crunchy taco.

11:24.220 --> 11:28.660
A taco. How exotic.

11:28.690 --> 11:31.790
They're not exotic. You can get 'em
on any street corner in New York.

11:31.830 --> 11:32.790
Stay out of this.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.030
You see?

11:34.060 --> 11:35.960
He wants to try new things.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.370
Like tacos.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.770
No, no, no.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.370
You see, it's not about the food.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.200
It's about staying true to
his character. Ask him.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.840
Isn't that right, Captain?

11:46.740 --> 11:49.370
Captain? Where'd he go?

11:49.410 --> 11:53.640
He probably went to go try one of those tacos you
said were on every street corner in New York.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.210
I was making a point.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.980
There's not a taco stand
within miles of here.

11:58.020 --> 12:00.480
- Come on.
- Sure, I could use a taco.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.550
Why not?

12:06.050 --> 12:07.780
Any luck finding Captain Jim Bob?

12:07.820 --> 12:09.820
Nope. You?

12:09.850 --> 12:12.220
No.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.560
You didn't look, did you?

12:15.790 --> 12:17.660
I looked around this general area.

12:17.690 --> 12:20.030
Wow.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.660
What are we going to do now?

12:21.700 --> 12:22.660
I don't know.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.570
I do know.

12:25.930 --> 12:27.370
I'll be right back.

12:32.370 --> 12:33.910
I got it. I got it.

12:33.940 --> 12:34.910
Check it out.

12:34.940 --> 12:38.480
It's the very collectible Captain
Jim Bob Sherwood Communicator.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.650
I would have never taken it out of
the box, but this is an emergency.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.580
Wait, Justin!

12:43.620 --> 12:46.620
I have something that will
work even better than that.

12:48.250 --> 12:51.190
Operator, can you get me
Captain Jim Bob Sherwood.

12:51.220 --> 12:54.460
Come in, Captain.
This is Command Base Five.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.390
This is so sad.

12:58.430 --> 12:59.790
You're like an eight year old.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.600
He's gone, dude.

13:01.630 --> 13:03.730
<i>This is Captain</i>
<i>Jim Bob Sherwood.</i>

13:03.770 --> 13:05.370
<i>Go ahead, Command Five.</i>

13:05.400 --> 13:06.930
My gosh, it works.

13:06.970 --> 13:10.440
Captain, we're gonna need
you to return to Base ASAP.

13:10.470 --> 13:12.310
<i>No can do, Command Five.</i>

13:12.340 --> 13:14.010
<i>There's too much crime</i>
<i>in this city,</i>

13:14.040 --> 13:17.140
<i>and I'm not going anywhere</i>
<i>until it's all gone.</i>

13:17.180 --> 13:19.840
<i>So, basically I'm</i>
<i>never coming back.</i>

13:19.880 --> 13:22.080
<i>Tell Jessica I give her</i>
<i>permission to make a pie</i>

13:22.110 --> 13:24.150
<i>for the county fair</i>
<i>with another fella.</i>

13:25.280 --> 13:26.720
<i>Over and out.</i>

13:26.750 --> 13:27.920
Captain! Wait. Captain!

13:27.950 --> 13:30.720
No over and out.
No over and out!

13:30.750 --> 13:33.690
Hey, wait a minute.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.420
He's out there fighting crime,

13:35.460 --> 13:38.120
we should stage a crime
here to lure him back.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.860
Quick, let's think of a crime.

13:39.890 --> 13:43.260
Uh, uh... OK.
I've got it!

13:43.300 --> 13:45.070
We'll have him think his
girlfriend Jessica Moon

13:45.100 --> 13:47.070
has fallen into the clutches
of evil villains.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.370
He's always saving her in the comic.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.300
Perfect.
I'll just bring Jessica to life.

13:50.340 --> 13:52.040
Really? Come on.

13:52.070 --> 13:53.310
That's what got us into this.

13:53.340 --> 13:55.780
We'll have to dress someone up
just like Jessica.

13:55.810 --> 13:58.550
And it's gonna have to be convincing.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.710
Maybe Harper can help.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.630
Does anyone else smell cinnamon rolls?

14:17.670 --> 14:19.800
Yes, that would be me.

14:19.830 --> 14:22.630
I finally found a scent that works
perfectly with your comic book.

14:22.670 --> 14:25.440
Cinnamon rolls is the scent
of friendship.

14:25.470 --> 14:28.600
What'd you do, wipe them on yourself?

14:28.640 --> 14:30.500
Alex, don't be disgusting.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.440
That'd just leave a sticky mess.

14:35.010 --> 14:36.780
I shoved them in my armpits.

14:36.810 --> 14:37.810
Oh!

14:40.080 --> 14:41.680
Who wants to be friends?

14:44.420 --> 14:45.580
People.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.620
Is the Jessica Moon costume ready?

14:48.920 --> 14:51.420
That looks great.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.890
You did a good job, Harper.

14:52.930 --> 14:55.630
You even got the little jewels right.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.100
- All right, Max, get on in.
- What? No.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.500
- Take a hike.
- You take a hike.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.610
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm sorry.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.410
Good. I'm gonna go change.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.510
Dude, how long does
she have to live here

15:09.550 --> 15:12.350
before she realizes that you
don't have to leave the room

15:12.380 --> 15:15.050
- to change clothes?
- Wait!

15:20.020 --> 15:21.650
What are you supposed to be?

15:21.690 --> 15:23.220
What kind of villain is that?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.090
I'm an evil queen.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.230
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of fancy bunny?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.560
Uh, no.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.430
I'm Archibald Van Cleef.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.240
Captain Sherwood's nemesis.

15:34.270 --> 15:36.970
I'm a billionaire scientist
who experiments on himself.

15:37.010 --> 15:40.040
Then a mouse climbed into one of
my chambers during an experiment

15:40.080 --> 15:42.810
and now I'm half-mouse,
half-billionaire-scientist.

15:42.850 --> 15:45.980
I could really go for a piece
of cheese right about now.

15:47.620 --> 15:50.390
And there are no evil queens
in Jim Bob's world.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.320
There's alwaysn evil queen.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.290
Sometimes she's the head cheerleader.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.690
Sometimes she's the
fairy tale stepmother.

15:56.730 --> 15:58.990
And sometimes she's your sister.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.670
Oh, this cannot be good.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.040
What is going on here?

16:12.080 --> 16:16.210
We are working together to solve
our problems just like you asked.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.580
Jerry, I think we have to...

16:21.620 --> 16:25.250
Set aside our bickering to deal
with something more important.

16:25.290 --> 16:27.620
The problems of our children.

16:29.430 --> 16:31.760
Or, we could paint the bedroom

16:31.790 --> 16:35.230
in a thinly veiled attempt
to get out of good parenti.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.360
- Butter pecan?
- I don't care if it's black.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.030
I just do not want to deal with this.

16:39.070 --> 16:40.800
- Oh!
- OK.

16:50.940 --> 16:54.280
Harper, I could have flashed
you into that costume.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.110
Oh. No thanks.
Whenever you do that,

16:56.150 --> 16:58.580
I feel like there's a brief
second where I'm naked.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.420
All right, now stand still.

17:01.450 --> 17:02.990
I'm going to put some
inviso-chains on you.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.690
Inviso-chains? I get it.

17:04.720 --> 17:10.329
I just gotta go, "Oh, no!
I've been inviso-chained. Ooh!"

17:11.460 --> 17:12.700
I'm so scared.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.170
Oh, my gosh!
There's really inviso-chains.

17:19.210 --> 17:21.670
Ow! And they're getting tighter.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.740
Oh, yeah.
You do not want to struggle.

17:23.780 --> 17:24.980
They'll just get tighter.

17:25.010 --> 17:28.810
And whatever you do...
Whatever you do, don't run.

17:28.850 --> 17:31.350
That's when the blades come out.

17:35.090 --> 17:36.050
OK!

17:37.960 --> 17:41.530
Now I'm gonna have to ask you to scream
for help into this device right here.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.160
We're gonna wait for Captain Jim
Bob Sherwood to come rescue you.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.300
Then, once he's triumphed in justice,

17:47.330 --> 17:49.800
he'll go back and want
to relax in Farmtown.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.370
Help! Captain Jim Bob!

17:53.400 --> 17:55.870
I'm Jessica Moon.
And I need help.

17:57.570 --> 17:58.970
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

18:02.040 --> 18:04.310
And here I am.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.850
And thank goodness too.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.950
Because there's not a
sanitary public restroom

18:07.980 --> 18:10.120
in this entire city.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.290
Over here!

18:11.320 --> 18:12.620
I've been inviso-chained.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.820
Which is misleading,
'cause there's blades.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.620
You'll never get her, Sherwood.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.190
Because I'm Archibald Van Cleef.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.290
As you can see, the ears and...

18:20.330 --> 18:23.230
Look, I've taken over all
the evil in New York City.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.870
Archibald Van Cleef.
I should have known.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.040
And who are you?

18:29.080 --> 18:32.040
- Evil queen.
- Yeah!

18:32.080 --> 18:33.110
That's a nifty idea.

18:33.150 --> 18:34.950
I haven't really fought one of those.

18:36.580 --> 18:40.490
Now stand aside while I reunite myself
with my beautiful Jessica Moon.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.420
And then, just like the 1950s,

18:42.460 --> 18:45.430
we could hold hands or possibly
kiss each other on the cheek.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.530
I hope that's not being
too forward, Jessica.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.560
I don't talk to astronauts.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.460
She's not going anywhere.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.730
You shall all feel the
wrath of the kung fu arts,

18:56.770 --> 18:58.040
that were taught to me

18:58.070 --> 19:00.570
by a secret department
of the US government.

19:05.180 --> 19:07.950
Wait a minute.
You're not Jessica Moon.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.250
Although you do have a faint
nose whistle like her.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.720
Yeah.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.490
Dr. Feldman says this nostril
is bigger than that one.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.860
But, um, my mom says
it makes me a treasure.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.430
But I just don't think we
have the money to fix it.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.430
And you're not Van Cleef.

19:25.470 --> 19:29.670
And you, may or may not
be who you say you are.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.270
I'm not quite sure.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.810
What's going on here?

19:33.840 --> 19:37.210
Listen, Captain.
I can explain. Uh...

19:37.250 --> 19:40.310
You need to let us put you back in the
comic book or your adventures are over.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.380
I'm afraid not.
I'm not leaving

19:42.420 --> 19:45.090
until I have blasted the crime
out of this <i>baño</i>

19:45.120 --> 19:47.050
that you call a city.

19:47.090 --> 19:48.590
That's what I do.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.490
I explore and I kick some butt
when I need to.

19:51.530 --> 19:55.060
I also take a beginning Spanish class.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.800
<i>Baño</i> is toilet.

19:58.270 --> 19:59.970
<i>Muy bien, muy bien.</i>

20:00.030 --> 20:02.100
But, but, but...
Wait!

20:02.140 --> 20:05.310
Look, Captain, this is
the real Jessica Moon.

20:05.340 --> 20:06.970
Forget about this city.

20:07.010 --> 20:08.310
She needs you.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.810
Oh, my! She has gotten
herself into quite a bind.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.780
You can see the fear in her eyes.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.280
I mean she is trapped.

20:14.310 --> 20:15.450
You're right.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.680
I have to go save her.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.950
Oh, she is a hottie.

20:21.490 --> 20:24.160
To tell you the truth
I don't mind leaving this city.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.160
It's a little bit of a relief.
It's pretty tough out there.

20:29.030 --> 20:31.260
Someone tried to break
my space helmet.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.770
While I was wearing it.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.970
Who does that sort of thing?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.240
Frizetta Kirby did go
into the comic you should go.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.940
Wow.

20:45.980 --> 20:47.350
We did it.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.180
Yep. We worked together
and we got him back.

20:50.220 --> 20:52.150
We could actually do
this comic book thing.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.350
Mm?

20:53.380 --> 20:55.520
Gosh, now I can see why
evil queens are so evil.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.290
This thing is making me irritable.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.270
Oh, no!

21:07.300 --> 21:09.400
The blades!
The blades!

21:18.740 --> 21:20.940
This really came out nice.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.040
Your drawings are so detailed.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.580
I don't even mind that he has
hot sauce in his space belt now.

21:27.650 --> 21:33.120
It's a weapon that goes well on
bad guys and tortilla chips.

21:34.490 --> 21:36.260
Oh, look. A review
for the comic book.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.890
- Oh!
- OK.

21:37.930 --> 21:42.830
"In the new issue of Captain
Jim Bob Sherwood's adventures,

21:42.860 --> 21:46.500
the baton has been passed
on to a new artistic team."

21:46.530 --> 21:48.170
That's us.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.270
"Sherwood is sucked into
an alternate frontier"

21:51.300 --> 21:55.740
that's riddled with crime and food
he's never encountered before.

21:55.770 --> 21:58.510
He rescues Jessica Moon
and returns to Farmtown

21:58.550 --> 22:01.880
"with an intergalactic
recipe for fajitas."

22:01.920 --> 22:03.420
Fajitas.

22:03.450 --> 22:06.220
"The Russo sisters Alex and Justine

22:06.250 --> 22:08.920
