04:40.489 --> 04:42.332
What the hell is going on?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.540
I had a dream.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.003
If there'd been anyone in the upper,

04:47.078 --> 04:49.251
you'd have sent him to hell on a shutter!

04:50.373 --> 04:51.966
I'm sorry, Mr. Bixby.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.794
By God, Mr. Otis,

04:53.877 --> 04:57.256
you will stow those damned irons
in your carpetbag,

04:57.339 --> 05:01.185
or I'll stop this train and set you out
in Wyoming on your boots!

05:03.553 --> 05:06.189
In September of 1874,

05:06.264 --> 05:08.767
Wild Bill Hickok came back
to the old west.

05:09.601 --> 05:13.231
I didn't place him then because
he was wearing a different name

05:13.313 --> 05:16.237
and he had a strange bee in his bonnet.

05:16.483 --> 05:20.033
A deadly dream that
was eating out his soul.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.740
A nightmare that he had to hunt down

05:22.823 --> 05:24.332
and face up to before

05:24.407 --> 05:27.581
it turned him into a raving maniac.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.088
I ought to know. I was there.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.050
Morning, Mr. Otis.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.593
Good morning.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.846
I regret the flummery of last night.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.010
Well, at least now
I understand why it happened.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.307
I wish I did.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.352
You don't have to kick chips with me, son.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.809
Time back, you caught yourself
a cold in the pants

05:50.892 --> 05:53.315
that just wouldn't let loose
of you, right?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.397
It's a scar that never heals.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.444
First it gets into your eyes.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.119
They can't stand the daylight,
even the bright moon.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.198
Then it rattlesnakes into your brains.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.500
You start dreaming nightmares.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.081
All bad.

06:12.330 --> 06:16.335
This white buffalo
keeps charging me, real as rain.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.590
Well, son, that dream is safe enough.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.807
The last white spike was put down

06:22.883 --> 06:25.682
by Prairie Dog Dave Morrow last month.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.015
Way the hell and gone on the Cimarron.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.442
Where you headed?

06:36.646 --> 06:40.196
Mr. Otis, a tenderfoot like you
isn't thinking of

06:40.275 --> 06:42.452
staking a claim in the Black Hills?

06:42.527 --> 06:44.370
Says there, "New land of promise."

06:44.446 --> 06:46.623
It don't promise nothing but a quick grave

06:46.698 --> 06:48.496
in a Sioux boneyard.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.058
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

10:49.232 --> 10:50.950
Where is the Little One?

11:06.207 --> 11:08.380
She's gone to the stars.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.115
Crazy Horse, my son.

11:30.190 --> 11:34.536
It is not fitting
that the war chief of the Oglalas

11:34.611 --> 11:36.864
weeps like a young woman.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.954
Therefore, I take away your true name.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.753
You shall be called "Worm."

11:43.828 --> 11:45.880
Where does her body lie?

11:45.955 --> 11:49.259
At Enchanted Mesa, above the lake.

11:49.334 --> 11:53.555
We placed her far from the Whites
and safe from wolves.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.225
It is time you sought out the holy bull.

11:57.300 --> 12:02.807
The Little One will be forever
tortured in the other world

12:02.889 --> 12:05.441
until you wrap her in his white robe

12:05.516 --> 12:08.690
and cleanse her spirit of its pain.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.344
Hear me, Holy One above!

12:42.011 --> 12:44.935
With a sacred voice, I call you!

12:45.014 --> 12:47.563
With a weeping heart, I ask this.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.353
Help me to find the white buffalo.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.438
My voice is on the smoke.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.504
I thank you, holy grandfather.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.514
Cheyenne!

13:23.052 --> 13:24.979
Ten-minute stop, folks.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.056
Ten minutes!

13:27.140 --> 13:29.025
What's that contraption?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.318
Buff bones.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.321
All that's left of 60 million spikes

13:33.396 --> 13:35.319
that once roamed the coast of Kansas.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.863
My God!

14:12.060 --> 14:13.687
God Almighty!

14:15.271 --> 14:16.488
Hello, Pete.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.241
Sweet Jesus, Bill.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.243
James Otis is the name, Pete.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.036
I heard you were back in Gotham

14:22.111 --> 14:25.285
playacting on the stage
with Billy Cody and making a barrel.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.959
Making a jackass out of myself, you mean.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.211
You! Tinhorn!

14:30.286 --> 14:32.459
There's no open seat in this town!

14:32.538 --> 14:34.040
Back on board.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.096
You scramble-brained son of a bitch!

14:40.171 --> 14:42.265
Are you trying to commit suicide?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.767
You think the Sioux have forgot
how you shot the head off

14:44.842 --> 14:46.389
of Whistler the Peacemaker?

14:46.469 --> 14:48.062
I'm money-bound, Pete.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.730
If you think a new handle and specs

14:49.806 --> 14:51.774
are gonna hide you, you're snaffled.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.568
You're up shit creek without a bullboat.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.733
You're clean out of friends.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.732
That include you, Pete?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.492
That's a hell of a thing to say to me.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.362
You better walk soft in Cheyenne.

15:04.445 --> 15:08.541
Tom Custer and a troop of his toospots
are in town on an Indian scout.

15:08.616 --> 15:12.295
He's made brag he'll turn your lights out
if he ever sees you again.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.338
Well, I'll peel an eye.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.088
Guess I won't see you
this side of again, Pete.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.260
That won't wet my eyes none.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.672
So long, Mr. James Otis, and good luck.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.176
If there's any left.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.449
- Where's Captain Custer?
- Back room, sonny.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.461
Captain Custer, sir.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.460
For Christ's sake,
Corporal Kileen, stand at ease.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.675
Hey, Paddy,
bring us another jug back here.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.922
What is it, Kileen?

16:01.002 --> 16:03.050
Captain, sir, Sergeant Scott
reports that he just saw

16:03.129 --> 16:06.015
Wild Bill Hickok come in
on the Overland Limited.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.350
God damn!

16:07.425 --> 16:09.894
He's using a different handle, James Otis,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.721
and hiding behind a pair of dark specs.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.147
Wonder what the hell he's doing here.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.395
Well, sir, the sergeant thinks
he's here after gold

16:15.475 --> 16:19.195
or on the trail of that white buff
we sighted in the Black Hills last August.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.898
I don't give a damn what he's after.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.234
But him and Paddy being old friends,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.820
sure as sun up, sooner or later

16:26.903 --> 16:30.908
he'll head right for here and find me.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.458
By damn! At last I have
that hair-triggered bastard in my sights.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.881
Kileen, get your ass over the depot
and tell Sergeant Scott

16:38.956 --> 16:40.458
to hang on to Hickok's trail.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.964
I wanna know exactly where he goes.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.092
Shake it up!

16:45.630 --> 16:47.177
What's the ruckus, Captain?

16:47.590 --> 16:49.308
Back in Hay City in '69,

16:49.383 --> 16:51.477
he caught and killed my horse
from under me.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.354
He back shot two of my best soldiers.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.690
That's a bucket of hot air.

16:55.765 --> 16:59.144
Bill never back shot nobody,
not in his whole life.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.979
You calling me a liar, Paddy?

17:01.062 --> 17:03.281
I'm saying you were blind drunk.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.660
Since I was bartender that night,

17:07.734 --> 17:08.987
I ought to know.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.746
You're looking to wear a marble hat.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.698
The truth is, it was your two sots

17:12.781 --> 17:15.041
who tried to back shoot Hickok and lost.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.790
Then he killed your nag
to keep it from killing one of us.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.498
What with it jumping up
on the billiard table and all.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.717
You want me as an enemy, Paddy?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.089
You never did give me goose bumps, Tom.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.844
Captain, you're right, sir.
Hickok's coming here now.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.600
He's just outside.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.936
Got him. You hug that bar
and keep your trap shut

17:34.011 --> 17:36.139
unless you want to die like him.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.184
Miles, take Kileen
and jump that son of a bitch

17:40.268 --> 17:41.861
when he comes through the door.

17:41.936 --> 17:45.861
Miles. You and the boys
make him dance before I knock him off.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.989
Yes, Tom. Come on, men,
we're gonna have a little fun.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.791
Let him dance to the tune!

18:09.672 --> 18:11.094
Bill!

18:15.845 --> 18:17.847
Again, Bill!

18:41.704 --> 18:43.377
Tom Custer tried to brace you.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.753
He's lit out hell for hades.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.130
You took a chance, Paddy.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.426
I owed you.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.004
Not that much.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.726
I heard Poker Jenny works here.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.054
She's the widow Schermerhorn now.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.606
Gone north to a wolf roost
called Fetterman

19:00.681 --> 19:02.524
to open her own place.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.568
Well, I happen
to be going that way myself.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.109
Bill, the word is out the Sioux are riding

19:11.192 --> 19:13.490
the Bozeman Trail like Irish banshees.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.996
So keep your pistol cocked.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.573
Thanks, Paddy.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.381
Hit the collars,
you swayback shad bellies!

19:36.967 --> 19:40.141
Giddyap, there, you lazy bastards!

19:40.221 --> 19:43.524
Yes, sir, Mr. Otis, old hard ass Custer

19:43.599 --> 19:46.193
has tossed the bear
into the beehive this time.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.645
You got a case against gold?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.196
Why do you think I'd be bouncing around

19:49.271 --> 19:51.365
in this bone-breaker on my way to that

19:51.440 --> 19:53.317
shitty little rat hole called Fetterman

19:53.401 --> 19:56.120
if I didn't succor after gold, huh?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.873
Well, watch your tongue, Mr. Coxy.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.167
You know, when that boy general done

20:01.242 --> 20:03.210
planted his boot down in the Black Hills,

20:03.285 --> 20:05.708
why he invited those
frigging feather headers

20:05.788 --> 20:07.131
out on the warpath!

20:07.206 --> 20:10.380
And by the time those scalp hunting
sons-of-bitches are through,

20:10.459 --> 20:14.339
there's gonna be a thousand bloody
nightcaps betwixt here and the Missouri.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.550
You have a filthy mouth.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.846
There's a lady at hand.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.518
You mean her?

20:23.139 --> 20:26.233
Any more hard tongue from you,
you'll settle with me.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.231
Taken kindly, Mr. Otis.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.657
You mind your manners, Mr. Coxy.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.993
God damn this shitty weather!

20:41.365 --> 20:43.117
Give me that!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.474
Damn your lazy hides!

20:58.549 --> 21:00.677
I'm getting just as wet as you are!

21:03.554 --> 21:06.103
What in hades hell is that?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.644
Yeah, green.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.105
Green from horn to hooks.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.779
I wouldn't try it on, Coxy.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.090
Oh, God, no, man!

21:35.169 --> 21:37.638
You wouldn't push me out
on Red Cloud's big open.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.473
For the love of heaven, no, you wouldn't!

21:39.548 --> 21:41.175
No!

21:46.931 --> 21:49.275
Otis! Otis!

21:49.350 --> 21:51.026
Otis, not here!

21:51.101 --> 21:53.229
Otis! Otis!

21:53.312 --> 21:55.485
Otis, wait for me!

21:55.564 --> 21:57.324
You wait! Wait!

21:57.399 --> 21:59.902
Don't leave me alone out here!

22:00.444 --> 22:02.913
You can't maroon a white man
in this country!

22:02.988 --> 22:04.865
You can't!

22:23.926 --> 22:25.352
I told him.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.395
You're about as green as snow.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.047
Come on, old boy.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.465
Come on around.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.776
Hey, dude.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.148
Give me a hand!

23:16.687 --> 23:19.782
Help me tie these
chowderheads off to the boot.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.945
We have more important business over here.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.083
Oh, hell!

23:41.378 --> 23:43.597
This one here is Jim Hanley.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.766
The other one's Pokerdeck Baker.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.935
They had a mine up yonder on the hill.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.729
Come on, let's get 'em inside.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.684
Get a hold of old Jim's boots
before he catches his death of cold.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.491
I'll get them horses.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.489
Boy.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.884
Lord Almighty!

24:29.510 --> 24:31.228
You think you got him?

24:34.181 --> 24:38.482
Well, at least ways
you sprinkled a little pepper on him.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.863
Jesus sakes, if you ain't Old Lightning!

24:40.938 --> 24:42.110
And all the time I's a thinking

24:42.189 --> 24:44.237
you didn't know B from bullshit!

24:44.316 --> 24:47.115
This lady's walking the streets of glory.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.238
God damn!

24:49.530 --> 24:52.750
Blue Whistler must have
caught her right in the third eye.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.670
Maybe you'd better ride up
on the box with me.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.217
Doesn't make any sense.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.340
No sane Indian would ride the warpath

25:04.420 --> 25:06.297
in this kind of weather.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.849
No sense at all, not even for a Sioux.

25:08.924 --> 25:12.394
Well, they ain't worried about it none.
Why should you?

25:12.469 --> 25:16.099
Giddyap there, come on.
Giddyap. Come on. Giddyap.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.701
Well, there she is, partner. Fetterman!

25:34.783 --> 25:37.044
Metropolis of the Bozeman Trail!

25:37.119 --> 25:39.546
Prettier than a nine teat sow, ain't she?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.464
Giddyap up there!

25:52.468 --> 25:54.141
Giddyap, there.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.224
...up there, Amos.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.231
What in hades hell you hauling back there?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.278
Couple of buff hunters.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.026
Who beefed them?

26:06.482 --> 26:07.859
Each to other.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.161
After they made glass
out of two quarts of Old Crow.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.660
This one with the grey socks,

26:13.739 --> 26:15.867
said he'd been charged by a white buff,

26:16.200 --> 26:19.625
back in the Black Hills
near the Elk Mountains.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.258
This one with the moccasins,
allowed as how this one

26:24.333 --> 26:26.586
was a fork tongue lying asshole.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.971
Well, the last white spike
was put in a hole

26:29.046 --> 26:30.844
down on the Cimarron last month.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.516
Amen.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.184
When you get through planting them two,

26:34.259 --> 26:37.229
I got three more customers
for you inside the coach.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.482
And I believe they've got enough money
to pay for their own boxes.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.559
Right kindly of you, Abel.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.522
You better lay 'em out
in the snow till I get back.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.106
Keep 'em fresh.

26:48.357 --> 26:51.361
You think that buff hunter
really did see a white spike?

26:51.443 --> 26:53.620
No! Most likely just Sioux smoke

26:53.695 --> 26:56.198
to keep the whites
from gold hunting in them hills.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.299
Will you look after my plunder
while I find a place to roost?

27:05.374 --> 27:07.676
There's only one place to roost.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.094
Mrs. Schermerhorn's.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.974
God Almighty, the cats!

27:14.049 --> 27:16.143
Hope they're all right.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.812
Yeah. You know, this bad-eyed geezer

27:18.887 --> 27:21.265
gave me ten dollars
to scare up all the stray cats

27:21.348 --> 27:23.601
I could find in Cheyenne.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.569
Would this geezer sporting a bad eye

27:25.644 --> 27:27.487
go calling himself Charlie Zane?

27:27.813 --> 27:30.066
Yeah, that's the bastard. You know him?

27:31.233 --> 27:32.735
I know him.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.650
You can warm your behind at the stove.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.445
Like some coffee?

28:09.521 --> 28:10.989
It's strong enough to float a Colt.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.941
I'd be forever in your debt, ma'am.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.577
Never mind the fancies.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.579
I'm Mrs. Schermerhorn.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.327
My pleasure.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.625
Do I know you?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.373
James Otis, ma'am.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.329
Don't know any Otis.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.506
But you sure as sin remind me of...

28:28.582 --> 28:30.084
Turn around!

28:33.378 --> 28:35.221
Poker Jenny, I believe.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.423
Bill!

28:36.965 --> 28:39.514
You four-flushing son of a bitch!

28:39.593 --> 28:41.140
You cold decked me.

28:42.596 --> 28:45.645
If you ain't a sight for a widow in weeds!

28:50.479 --> 28:52.481
I always could get you
mounted fast, couldn't I?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.449
Such talk!

28:54.524 --> 28:57.243
How long ago was it
when we pleasured in Hays City, huh?

28:57.319 --> 28:59.538
Seems like forever, Cateyes.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.912
It's been that way for me, too, Jen.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.914
Well, tell me, what
brings you up in this neck, huh?

29:08.038 --> 29:09.540
Custer's gold.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.671
Yeah.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.219
Well, there's a heap up
in those Black Hills.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.181
I'm starving you to death, Cateyes.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.009
You wait right here.

29:27.641 --> 29:31.817
Guess you heard about me and Lucas
Schermerhorn getting noosed, huh?

29:32.854 --> 29:35.528
Just about the same time
I heard you were a widow again.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.618
Don't be a bastard.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.536
Lucas was a lucky man, Jen.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.038
Thank you, Cateyes.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.950
Why do you always call me Cateyes?

29:47.077 --> 29:49.125
Ain't you ever seen
those wild eyes of yours

29:49.204 --> 29:50.956
when you're loving it up,

29:51.039 --> 29:53.883
or when you're hitching
your pistols on for a shindy?

29:53.959 --> 29:57.384
I'm a man of comity,
I've always dodged a fight.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.557
Comity? Sure.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.057
You're the most politest shootist
who ever blew a man's brains out.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.060
I'm too done in
to even argue about it, Jen.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.730
Why don't you let me
put you to bed in my room?

30:29.828 --> 30:32.297
Jen, I ain't got the gumption for it.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.507
That'll the day.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.880
Truth.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.798
You just lie still there.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.130
I'll fly the eagle.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.639
No, Jen.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.477
Some time back, one of your
scarlet sisters dosed me proper.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.476
I'm not about to ride the high horse.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.854
Hell, I probably gave it to you myself.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.780
I'll take the chance.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.358
But I won't.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.119
All right, Cateyes.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.155
You take yourself a sound snooze.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.955
But since you're a gambling man,

31:10.035 --> 31:11.833
I'll bet you 6-2 and even

31:11.912 --> 31:14.631
that when you wake up,
I'll talk you into it.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.878
We'll see.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.836
I'll leave the door open,
in case you need anything.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.064
Dear Mother of God!

32:17.519 --> 32:19.362
Dear Mother of God!

32:19.438 --> 32:22.738
It was like you were fighting
Armageddon with Satan himself!

32:22.816 --> 32:24.363
It's all right. It's all right.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.116
But you damned near drowned me!

32:27.154 --> 32:29.122
Where the hell did that thing come from?

32:29.197 --> 32:32.626
When Bill Cody was
shooting meat for the railroad,

32:32.701 --> 32:35.837
they thought it'd be a good stunt to
pass out buff heads to all the nabobs.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.789
And they gave you a white buff head?

32:37.873 --> 32:40.501
You, a doxie? That's worth 2,000 gold.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.553
It ain't real. I mean, I had it painted.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.221
I put in the pink eyes.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.850
Jesus. I'm sorry, Jen.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.552
I'll get it mended.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.893
I don't ever want to see it again!

32:58.143 --> 32:59.986
Well, hell spawn.

33:01.563 --> 33:04.533
If the time's come for neck or nothing,

33:05.692 --> 33:07.444
you've found your man.

33:15.118 --> 33:18.873
Bill. Has that sickness gone to your head?

33:19.414 --> 33:23.760
This damn dream, Jen,
hangs on like a low water leech.

33:25.086 --> 33:28.431
If I don't kill this buff,
the dream will kill me.

33:29.341 --> 33:33.187
It's like my own fate
was chasing me into the grave.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.565
You have to turn away from it, Bill.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.517
I got to call it out.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.527
Call out a dream?

33:40.602 --> 33:42.195
The only way.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.615
But don't worry, Jen,
I'll be gone in the morning.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.449
Frozen Dog's a hellhole.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.205
Keep a wall at your back.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.953
You're alone up there.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.209
I'm used to that.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.877
Bill.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.292
I lost my bet.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.171
No, Jen. I did.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.911
Now be gentlemen.
Now give the ladies some room here.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.036
It's ten dollars for one minute, gents.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.833
One golden eagle for sixty seconds!

34:37.909 --> 34:41.413
And then ride that horse
for just as long as you can pay

34:41.496 --> 34:44.670
or there'll be a short funeral at sunup!

34:46.251 --> 34:48.253
Come on, boys, line up over here.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.452
All right, come on, let's get
over there, you silly peckerwood.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.329
Now be gentlemen.
Give the ladies some room.

35:14.404 --> 35:15.997
Now don't fret about it, Charlie.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.124
Come on back when you got
some iron in your barrel,

35:18.199 --> 35:20.001
and it'll be my treat.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.831
Yeah. Well, thank you kindly, Frieda.

35:24.914 --> 35:27.463
Jim, you in good luck today 'cause

35:27.542 --> 35:30.011
you gonna meet my beautiful Frieda!

35:31.171 --> 35:32.593
To the Republic.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.738
Well, old timer.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.193
All curried and tame?

35:55.236 --> 35:56.738
Name's James Otis.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.378
Old timer, I'm looking for

36:03.453 --> 36:05.547
a glass-eyed goose hisser
named Charlie Zane.

36:05.789 --> 36:06.836
Princely fellow.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.418
This fella Zane wears a snow white mane,

36:09.501 --> 36:11.720
which got that way
'cause he's scared of redskins.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.428
He's been known to puddle his britches
at a Kiowa war whoop.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.434
You old fiddlefoot!

36:20.762 --> 36:22.856
Charlie, you sure Custer
found gold up there

36:22.931 --> 36:24.308
and not a field of dandelions?

36:24.391 --> 36:25.483
He struck it.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.402
Then what's a backshooting
claim jumper like you

36:27.477 --> 36:28.774
doing here instead of there?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.363
You need gear to dig a mine.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.940
I had to raise a bankroll.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.196
The cats!

36:37.112 --> 36:39.414
All right, gents, come now.
Line up for the...

36:39.489 --> 36:40.866
Place your bets.

36:44.077 --> 36:47.456
You figuring on marshaling
in this one-dog town?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.291
No, I'll never wear the tin again.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.921
I know why you're here.

36:51.793 --> 36:53.670
You're on a scout for the white buffalo.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.515
Old timer, I thought
you were too ripe for fairy tales.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.809
Well, would you believe it
from an eyewitness?

37:01.302 --> 37:02.771
Depends which eye.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.645
Don't cornhole me, young sass!

37:05.724 --> 37:08.898
I was with General Custer when we hit
the nuggets at French Creek

37:08.977 --> 37:10.820
and that lollygagger of a buff

37:10.895 --> 37:14.616
challenged the whole goddamn
Seventh Cavalry to a showdown!

37:19.571 --> 37:21.369
It's all coming true.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.083
What're you prattling about?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.256
Old timer.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.293
Straight tongue.

37:34.127 --> 37:36.550
You really saw a white spike?

37:36.713 --> 37:37.839
Saw him?

37:39.174 --> 37:41.848
Son-of-a-bitch threw
half a mountain down on me.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.833
Barkeep! Two stiff horns of gin.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.205
And mind you,

38:06.284 --> 38:09.538
none of that pig pee
you spigot out to these swill bellies.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.712
I only sell the fizz, friend.
I don't make it.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.717
Five dollars a bottle.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.471
You insinuating
we're shortshirks in this camp, Mr...

38:18.546 --> 38:19.968
Brady is the name.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.017
There was a defalcating son-of-a-bitch

38:23.092 --> 38:25.766
down in the nations named Brady.

38:25.845 --> 38:29.395
He sold six barrels to Chief Mo-Wi
and his Comanches.

38:29.891 --> 38:33.896
And after them stinking redskins
got lubricated up,

38:33.978 --> 38:35.480
they made a little war

38:36.314 --> 38:38.567
and wiped out half of my outfit.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.945
That's a hell of a thing, Mr...

38:41.027 --> 38:42.244
Kileen.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.158
Whistling Jack Kileen?

38:48.451 --> 38:50.712
Well, now, look, Mr. Kileen.

38:50.787 --> 38:54.716
The name Brady's as common
as hen shit back in the old country.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.168
I ain't your man.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.800
I'm only an old damn harp
out from the States

38:58.878 --> 39:00.505
trying to make a roll.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.636
And to show you the good faith,

39:04.759 --> 39:06.561
gin is on the house.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.559
That's mighty generous.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.150
Maybe too damn generous.

39:17.939 --> 39:20.909
All right, you jaspers,
you've had my table long enough.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.078
- Skedaddle.
- Yeah, you don't say.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.947
I just did.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.536
- Aaron!
- Yup!

39:30.618 --> 39:32.754
Watch those hide hunters.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.126
Sure enough.

39:41.754 --> 39:45.008
Mr. Otis, I'll pay you 500 in gold

39:45.091 --> 39:48.269
if you'll back me
in any play made here tonight.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.561
Who are they?

39:49.637 --> 39:50.730
Where?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.682
Behind your glass eye.

39:54.142 --> 39:57.021
The long bean is Whistling Jack Kileen.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.115
He's the meanest son-of-a-bitch alive.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.694
I was in Julesburg when I saw him
cut an Indian trader into 300 pieces

40:04.777 --> 40:06.905
for selling a Winchester to Roman Nose.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.957
And the sprag's name is Kid Jelly.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.375
A grease spot,

40:10.450 --> 40:12.293
and I mean hot grease.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.296
No, thanks, Mr. Brady.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.793
It's not my fight.

40:17.165 --> 40:20.715
Well, it damn well might be
if Kileen knows who you really are.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.260
Hey, what kind of tattle
you talking about?

40:24.339 --> 40:26.933
I'm talking about what happened
down in Cheyenne City

40:27.008 --> 40:28.760
two days ago!

40:28.843 --> 40:31.062
You're talking yourself to death.

40:37.727 --> 40:41.698
Tom Custer and some of his larrigans
tried to brace me at Paddy Welch's.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.650
Kileen's kid was one of them.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.903
How'll it go?

40:47.654 --> 40:51.909
Brady'll send the kid over with a couple
of free bottles of "Oh Be Joyful."

40:53.993 --> 40:57.372
When he gets there,
he'll drop the word like a buffalo chip.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.183
I just heard the plop.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.540
Keep your shitty boots
outta my way, old man,

41:32.615 --> 41:34.663
unless you wanna be buried in 'em!

41:34.742 --> 41:37.378
Now, now, sonny boy.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.625
Didn't your ma never tell you

41:38.705 --> 41:41.049
your mouth wasn't made for breaking wind?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.058
.36 is my caliber.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.271
I was brought up bad.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.196
You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.322
Nine's the winner.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.742
Pay the nine.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.038
Place your bets.

42:57.784 --> 42:59.293
This one's found his mark.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.370
And here comes the kid. Jiggers.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.542
Mind the Texan.

43:19.472 --> 43:21.725
Make your play, you glass-eyed gasbag!

43:33.236 --> 43:34.954
Cover my back, old timer.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.707
This is your night, Hickok.

43:41.786 --> 43:44.039
But there's gonna be another time.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.708
Don't let me see you again.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.961
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do...

43:50.044 --> 43:51.045
You peached.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.802
I swear by Sweet Jesus I didn't.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.974
You swear yourself to Hell!

43:56.926 --> 43:58.644
It's Wild Bill Hickok himself!

44:00.555 --> 44:02.557
He got 'em both with one shot.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.893
He got 'em both with one shot!

44:12.567 --> 44:15.161
Well, Captain,
your new name didn't last long.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.330
You sure used this town up fast.

44:17.405 --> 44:19.540
We'd best show a heel in these parts.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.492
Question is, which way?

44:22.201 --> 44:23.919
New camp forming up north.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.418
Place called Deadwood Gulch.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.585
Charlie,

44:31.460 --> 44:34.430
you know what I hate more
than anything else in this world?

44:35.214 --> 44:36.431
More than Indians?

44:36.507 --> 44:38.017
Even more than dying.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.344
What?

44:39.427 --> 44:40.679
Being afraid.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.397
What, you mean in there?

44:43.472 --> 44:44.849
I mean out there.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.277
Easterly?

44:48.352 --> 44:49.854
That's Sioux land.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.191
There's nothing out there
but the Big Open and the Black Hills.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.528
And the white buffalo.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.492
How many men you rubbed out, Captain?

46:27.034 --> 46:28.331
Mostly Indians.

46:31.497 --> 46:33.545
You really got no gut for Indians, do you?

46:34.292 --> 46:36.090
Like Phil Sheridan said,

46:36.168 --> 46:39.217
"I ain't never seen a good Indian
that wasn't dead."

47:06.240 --> 47:08.242
Take it easy, old timer.

47:09.118 --> 47:10.415
He's out of range.

47:20.129 --> 47:22.177
Looks like he's on his own.

47:34.894 --> 47:36.692
We'd best get out of here.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.916
Use the long gun.
I'll take the Winchester.

48:54.682 --> 48:57.185
Rein up, Captain. Ain't our fight.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.027
Look down below.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.472
It's an Indian hullabaloo.

49:30.551 --> 49:32.053
But she's a daisy!

49:38.976 --> 49:42.776
Troop of Absarokes chasing
one flea-bit Sioux egg-sucker.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.778
What are Crows doing in Sioux country?

49:49.111 --> 49:52.115
Yeah. Probably heard about the white buff

49:52.198 --> 49:53.666
on the Moccasin telegraph.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.205
Fifteen, I count.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.382
Listen to that red nigger take on!

50:01.457 --> 50:04.427
He's madder than a wet mouse
and don't scare worth a hiccup!

50:05.920 --> 50:07.797
No chance, though.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.427
Fifteen to one.

50:09.924 --> 50:11.426
Fifteen to three.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.475
You're gonna take a hand?

50:44.583 --> 50:46.256
I'm gonna flank them.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.390
Peel an eye, Captain.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.362
Hello, White-eye.

51:51.025 --> 51:52.698
My heart is good.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.822
I thank you for helping me

51:56.572 --> 51:58.119
kill my enemies.

52:00.326 --> 52:03.921
Friend. You are very brave.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.878
Come to my council.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.711
It cannot be done.

52:11.295 --> 52:13.593
Father sun climbs high.

52:13.881 --> 52:16.430
And it's far to the lodges of my people.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.229
But I will not forget you, White-eye.

52:52.294 --> 52:53.887
Want I should splat him, Captain?

52:53.962 --> 52:56.260
Nervy rooster, ain't he?

52:56.715 --> 52:59.264
You must be wearing hard bark to turn
your back on that scratch cat.

52:59.343 --> 53:02.142
You know damn well
brave men don't back shoot.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.189
And that redskin's all sand.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.642
You gonna let him march out
and raise troops?

53:06.725 --> 53:08.527
You're prating like a farmer, Charlie!

53:08.602 --> 53:10.195
He's after the white buff, same as us.

53:10.270 --> 53:11.522
Well, let me finish him now.

53:11.605 --> 53:12.982
- Then we'd never find out.
- What?

53:13.065 --> 53:15.363
Whether or not he knows
where that white spike is.

54:15.544 --> 54:16.761
Indians?

54:16.837 --> 54:18.839
No. Thought I heard buffalo.

54:20.174 --> 54:22.176
Wait. I got a peeper.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.538
By heaven!

54:48.535 --> 54:50.583
Old timer, shake out a round!

55:02.549 --> 55:04.051
I see him!

55:04.134 --> 55:05.556
I see him!

55:05.886 --> 55:08.059
What the hell!

55:08.138 --> 55:09.857
He walked into solid rock!

55:09.932 --> 55:11.900
No, there's a cave up there.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.860
That's where we'll camp tonight.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.813
What about old Nicodemus?

55:15.896 --> 55:17.273
He won't hang around.

55:18.857 --> 55:20.279
You damn sure?

55:21.401 --> 55:23.119
It's not in my nightmare.

55:57.479 --> 55:58.947
Break out some tallow.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.787
Make some more of these, Charlie.

56:08.073 --> 56:10.701
You really going in that
Black Hole of Calcut?

56:11.368 --> 56:13.041
I've got a friend.

57:37.079 --> 57:39.252
Hell spawn's gone.

57:39.331 --> 57:41.208
There's another hole back there.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.802
He knows his way back.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.845
It's not in my dream.

57:46.672 --> 57:48.549
There has to be snow.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.426
Heavy snow.

57:57.474 --> 58:00.523
I sure as hell wish you hadn't said that.

58:08.652 --> 58:10.074
Mare broke loose.

58:42.853 --> 58:45.106
That scurvy spike has killed the mare.

58:45.188 --> 58:47.316
He's hightailed it
to the other side of the mountain.

58:47.399 --> 58:49.447
For God's sake, Captain, wait up!

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.901
Charlie!

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:09.948
Keep your noodle down!

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.697
This is between Hickok and us.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.787
Hickok!

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.240
Here I am, Hickok!

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:20.746
Go ahead, take a couple of shots!

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:24.379
If you think your short guns
will reach that far!

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:28.717
Well, come on!

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.136
What's the matter, Hickok?

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.839
Hey! Here I am up here!

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.516
Well, come on!

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.685
What're you waiting for, Hickok?

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.687
Come on!

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.730
Damn you, Hickok!

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.025
Make your move! I don't wanna have to

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.569
put a bullet in a frozen carcass.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:57.840
Hang on, Captain! I'll get you home!

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.425
Stay put, Charlie!

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.144
Gyp, where's Ben?

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.722
He's gone to hell in a hurry!

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.898
All right, then, you make your move

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.977
before the storm gives Hickok cover!

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.805
For God's sake, Captain, put down roots!

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.678
The Colts will never cut it!

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.010
There's snow on the wind. Wait it out!

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.281
Get out of here, you damn lobo,
before I skin you alive!

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.546
By heaven!

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:19.137
The red dandy's joined the Brigade.

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:42.369
Captain.

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:45.072
You want I should foreclose
on his mortgage?

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:49.159
Wasichu! The demon is dead.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.253
My thanks to you!

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:56.675
What are you whites doing in this land?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.678
This is Pa Sappa,

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:02.006
the country of the Lacotas.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:05.600
These mountains belong to me!

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.812
Now

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:11.606
the thunderbird

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.276
is eating the sky.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:19.360
Soon, plenty of snow.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:24.361
Come to my council, my brother.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:28.957
We will make good medicine.

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:42.175
Wahi cola! I am coming, my friend.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.083
Pretty slick, Captain.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.330
What?

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.961
The way you suckered him.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:18.256
You try hanging a wooden suit
on that child, you'll answer to me!

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:20.091
That snow ossify your brain?

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.793
I gave him my word.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:26.678
Your word to a redskin? Come on, Captain.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:29.009
That's like shoveling fleas in a barn.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:32.346
Just get the hell back there,
grow a fire and make some grub.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.617
- Washtay.
- Welcome, friend.

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:50.072
Are you the wasichu
we Sioux call Okute, the Shooter?

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.124
The one who killed
Whistler the Peacemaker?

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.952
What kind of a question
is that between friends?

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.707
Are you the murderer called Hickok?

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.717
The Cheyenne call me Pahaska.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.303
Longhair?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.550
Longhair.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.799
Come on back when you're ready.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.687
Let me tell you something, sonny.

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:17.023
Trusting Jehovah himself
can be a touchy business.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:19.984
But when you start betting your poke
on that red cat-skinner,

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.812
you are drawing to an inside straight.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.569
Something about him.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.659
Just another buck on the warpath.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.782
No, he's not.
He's not just an ordinary buck.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.871
Can't you see the way
he wears that eagle feather?

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:33.373
Like a chief!

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:34.995
Jiggers!

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.376
Washtay.

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.828
Come in. Come in.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:48.221
Longhair.
I saw that you do not own a long gun.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:50.390
This I took from the demon.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:51.637
It is yours.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:53.013
Many thanks.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:56.896
But the long gun
my friend's been shooting,

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.099
this one belongs to me.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:03.278
He doesn't own one.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.137
Dognation!

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.143
Well, thanks, sonny, but the fact is

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.563
I ain't got nothing
good enough to swap you.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:41.562
You give me shelter
and you share your food.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.477
That ain't foofaraw. Wait.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.149
But wait! Hanging up!

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.316
I got a proper geegaw!

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.424
What do they call you?

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.884
Nadonaissioux myeyelo.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.340
I am small snake.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.721
I don't think so.

01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:20.438
You are

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.356
Little Snake?

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.113
Worm? Worm.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.658
Worm. Yes. I am called Worm.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:36.287
How is the old one called?

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.363
The Cheyenne call him Ochinee.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.746
One Eye?

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.335
The same.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.707
The great white warrior of Sand Creek?

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.716
You speak crookedly.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.252
This cannot be true.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.971
He thinks your glass eye is real.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.011
Watch.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:11.106
Who says I'm not Ochinee, eh?

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.942
Who says I'm not the great One-Eye?

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.122
That's enough, Charlie!

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.950
My friend's a clown. There's no magic.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.880
This is glass, like beads.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.049
It's not real.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:32.343
But is he truly Ochinee?

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:34.511
He's truly One-Eye.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:37.631
Fix the grub.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.764
I'm gonna fix us up
a real pea warmer of a breakfast.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.345
Buff steaks and flapjacks.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.477
When it comes to belly cheating,
I really shine.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.233
Start shining because I have a feeling

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.435
our friend Worm has a wolf in his belly.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:11.675
Longhair, we must make
our water on these stones.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.718
I don't figure that white buffalo's

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.467
gonna turn tail
at a little sprinkling of pee.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.966
It is the way brother wolf
marks his hunting grounds.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.143
And the buffalo respects the wolf.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.725
Tatanka!

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.771
Sing your death song!

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:09.941
Soon I will slay you
as you slew the Little One.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.485
Soon I will wrap her in your holy robe!

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.072
These are my words!

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.609
This buffalo is mine!

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.911
The hell you say!

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.539
The buffalo will belong
to the hunter who kills him.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.087
Mine, alone!

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.961
Well, Captain,

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.888
seems like we found ourselves
a porcupine to play with.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.433
Just ride easy, Charlie.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.473
Let's fix that wall.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:59.907
Longhair.
Why are you whites in my country?

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:12.378
We did not ask the whites to come here.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.882
The Great Spirits
gave us these hills as a home.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:19.844
You say, why do not we become civilized?

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.921
We do not want your civilization.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:24.799
You've spoken red truth.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:28.477
Tell me then white truth, Longhair.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.525
In the first place, the Great Spirit

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.853
did not give you these hills.

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.698
You took this land by force.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.697
You took it from the Cheyenne,
the Shoshone and the Arapaho.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.369
You took it with the lance and tomahawk.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.206
And now the white man makes war on you.
What's the difference?

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.329
The whites have no honor.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:53.127
Where white man walks,
death comes out of season.

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.292
That's a thing called progress.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:57.502
It's a thing called greed.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.550
Tell me this.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.128
Am I evil because my skin is red?

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:06.766
Is it a wicked thing that I was born
where my father was born?

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:10.061
Is it a bad thing
that I would die for my people?

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:13.064
It's still red truth and not real truth.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:15.483
Tell me this true truth, then.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.399
Give Red John the word!

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:21.735
Tell the little rooster he's extinct!

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:25.826
Worm.

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:29.409
When Sitting Bull was a boy,

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.959
the Sioux could throw
10,000 warriors into battle.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.128
Today it's the white man's turn.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.877
Those that you have seen
on these hills and on the plains

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.257
are like a handful of beads.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:40.754
There are many!

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.835
They are more than the blades
of spring grass,

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.804
more than the buffalo
when they smothered the earth

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:46.381
in their great herds.

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:49.718
There's no way to stand
against the white man!

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.895
Their weapons are terrible!

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:54.889
They have the power!

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:59.360
You will bend
to the long knives or be broken.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:03.239
You will live as they say,
or die on their bayonets.

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.408
That was straight tongue, Captain.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:08.069
If such is the true truth,

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.530
then I will sing my death song.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:13.537
No. I'll not have your death.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.627
Why not? You are white.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:20.002
First, I am your brother and your friend.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.087
Longhair. Between us...

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:29.219
There shall be no war.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:34.971
Bullshit.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:56.977
Jesus!

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.739
Charlie, light a torch.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:21.202
So goddamn dark in here, couldn't find
my own pizzle if I had to pee.

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:35.508
Is he in?

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:44.851
He's gone.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.527
Jesus Christ!

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:25.107
Well, Captain,
snow's stopped, Wind's done,

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:27.935
and our cock-a-doodle
was holding aces behind his knee.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:32.323
Friend Worm has seen fit
to ride off on the scout without...

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.196
...cutting our throats,

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.403
which was mighty white
of the red ragamuffin.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.787
Yeah. Didn't even leave
a mouse sign to point the way.

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:50.500
For a moment there was a chance,
just a chance,

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.590
maybe one more day.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.890
Hell, I guess there never
will be an answer.

01:17:57.965 --> 01:18:01.219
Well, it all depends on the question,
Captain. Come on, let's go.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.534
It's Worm telling us to clear off.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.248
Well, I sure as hell can't wait
to argue that point with him.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.806
What is it?

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.266
Take a whiff.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.778
Yeah, that's buffalo, by God!

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.605
Coming from right down there.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.988
Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna go dark fast.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.740
Better find ourselves a stand.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.380
By heaven!

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.210
Charlie, this is the place!

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.388
This is Armageddon.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.142
This is the place in my nightmare.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.891
The place where I fought
the white buffalo.

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:10.522
I'll be a Dutchman!

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:13.025
First time I ever saw hokum come true.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.653
We'd better fort up in that piney grove

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:17.446
and keep the trees at our back.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.788
Captain, you sure
you wanna play this hand?

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.794
You wanna make tracks, Charlie?

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.422
Two thousand dollars
don't much pleasure a dead man.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:41.219
Hell or heaven,

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.515
if this is the night I was born for,

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:45.762
so be it.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.309
Amen.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.853
Better take the Winchester.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:54.566
You only got one shot in that.

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:56.143
All it takes.

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:58.775
Don't freeze.

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:00.690
Colder than a hooker's heart.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.450
I'll back you up from here.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.421
Captain!

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:08.515
Captain!

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.779
Captain, you awake?

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.330
There to your left!

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:32.873
It's a wolf!

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:38.504
It's Worm.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:42.170
You want I should rub him?

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:45.214
No, the sharp might scare away the spike.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:51.809
Maybe that demon horned bag
of tricks has flimflammed us.

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.477
He's here.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.972
I know he's here.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:41.035
Jesus sake's, Captain, put him down!

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.665
Shoot! Shoot!

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:50.798
Captain!

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:23.835
Pteska!

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:25.708
Captain, for the love of God, peel an eye!

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:26.913
He's on the charge again!

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.545
Captain!

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:03.241
Worm, use the gun!

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:12.084
Captain! Captain!

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.809
Captain, for the love of Jesus,
what are you doing?

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:22.227
Captain!

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.602
Use the gun!

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:52.943
You all right?

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.941
Is the wanagi dead?

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.193
Hell, no, he's run off.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.704
He's clear to Christmas by now.

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:31.620
Why didn't you use your gun?

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.998
I am war chief of the Oglalas.

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:36.250
I could not use the white man's iron.

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:39.041
This bull had to be taken in the old way.

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:42.135
Until I slew this bull in the old way,

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.804
I could not wear my own name again.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:47.512
You're Crazy Horse.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:51.186
Pahaska, my friend,

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.730
truly we have suckled at the same mother.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:56.775
Truly we are brothers
born from the same belly.

01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:05.533
Will you look
at that mountain of meat, huh?

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:08.369
Who got him?

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:09.867
Cahoots.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:15.043
He'll never even know he's dead.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.290
The robe belongs to Worm.

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:27.301
God damn you, Hickok!

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.218
Damn you and your red rooster!

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:34.555
You can't do it!
You can't throw $2,000 gold

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:36.439
on a maggot meal papoose!

01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:38.516
Charlie, I'll make it up you in Cheyenne.

01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:44.655
So you went and got yourself
some red religion, huh?

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:52.118
Well, you can tell your blood brother
to shove it up his ass!

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.537
We're quits.

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:27.900
Don't try it on, old timer.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.956
Stop scaring me, Captain.

01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:41.834
I only got one clean pair of drawers left.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:46.093
You sanctimonious son-of-a-bitch!

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:11.447
You have lost a friend.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:14.112
So it seems.

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:18.249
And found one.

01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:48.438
Is everything done?

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.237
It is done.

01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:54.411
When I cover the Little One with the robe,

01:32:54.486 --> 01:32:57.365
she will be healed and well
and whole in the other world.

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.492
Will you have the right
to wear your own name again?

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:06.374
Then I'll be saying goodbye, Crazy Horse.

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:12.754
Hickok.

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:18.427
You heard One-Eye call my name.

01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:20.471
Yes.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:23.481
You are Okute the Shooter.

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:26.355
The one who killed
Whistler the Peacemaker.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:29.112
That was another time

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:31.406
when I was young and headstrong.

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:33.324
It was a bad thing.

01:33:33.399 --> 01:33:34.776
Can't be undone.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.621
I will tell no others.

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.539
But, Longhair,

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:43.293
though you and I are brothers,

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:45.587
we must never meet again.

01:33:45.662 --> 01:33:49.041
Hear me, my friend. These are my words.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:52.469
We must never cross paths in the tomorrow.

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:57.011
For if we do,
I will see only a white enemy.

01:33:57.382 --> 01:33:59.726
And you will see only an Indian.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:03.226
And we will both solve the Great Mystery.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:07.393
Ohinyan, Longhair.

01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:10.729
Ohinyan

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.235
forever.
